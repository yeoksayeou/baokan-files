Xinhua News Agency, 8th Dispatch: According to statistics from the Ministry of Forestry, a total of over 10.32 million hectares have been afforested nationwide in the past five years, exceeding the target of the First Five-Year Plan by 71%; the forest planted in these five years is more than 30 times the amount planted during the Kuomintang rule, and about one-seventh of China's existing total forest area. Significant achievements have also been made in forest protection and survey work in the past five years.

In order to cultivate a reserve base for the forest industry, the newly planted forests are mainly timber forests. The construction of timber forests is mainly concentrated in the twelve southern provinces with faster tree growth, totaling more than 4.74 million hectares. After thirty years, these new forests can produce approximately 850 million cubic meters of timber. Secondly, in the past five years, the state has built more than 2.64 million hectares of protection forests and water source forests in areas that have always been severely threatened by wind, sand, and soil erosion, and has closed hillsides for afforestation to nurture a large number of trees. The main areas include windbreak and sand-fixation forests in eastern Henan, western Northeast, eastern Inner Mongolia, northern Shaanxi, and the Hexi Corridor. The protection forests in eastern Henan have transformed the barren old course of the Yellow River into a green plain, protecting 170,000 hectares of farmland and making 40,000 hectares of sandy wasteland usable. Various regions have also built more than 1.9 million hectares of economic forests for oil tea, tung oil, raw lacquer, walnuts, star anise, and cinnamon, among which tung oil production has recovered to near pre-war levels.

In the past five years, an unprecedented upsurge in tree planting and afforestation has swept across the country, from Turpan in Xinjiang to the beaches of Fujian, from Inner Mongolia to Hainan Island. Many "Youth Forests" and "Women's Forests" have emerged, and the situations of bare rocks, soil erosion, and wind and sand damage have been changed in many places, and thousands of villages have been greened.

Before liberation, due to indiscriminate logging, coupled with forest fires and pests, China's forest area gradually decreased. In the early days of liberation, due to the country's urgent need for timber and the fact that tree planting could not keep up with logging, the shrinking of forest area still existed. However, the results of afforestation during the First Five-Year Plan have improved this situation. Not only have great achievements been made in afforestation in the past five years, but the state has also managed the main forest areas across the country, conducted management surveys of 20.01 million hectares of forests, and compiled management plans for the Changbai Mountain, Lesser Khingan Mountains, and upper reaches of the Minjiang River forest areas, and is currently compiling management plans for the Greater Khingan Mountains, Mudanjiang, Dajinchuan, Bailongjiang, Qinling, and Hainan Island forest areas. Forest protection work has also been continuously strengthened. In addition to the continuous construction of many forest management stations and the construction of forest roads and telephone lines and other general protection facilities, more than 50 fire risk weather forecasting stations and chemical fire extinguishing stations have also been established. During the spring and autumn fire hazard seasons, forest protection aircraft patrol over the main forest areas. In the past five years, the forest area treated for pine caterpillar pests reached 770,000 hectares, equivalent to seven times that of 1952, and the occurrence area of bamboo locusts has also been greatly reduced.

The exact size of China's forest area and its reserves were not clear during the Kuomintang rule. After several years of investigation after liberation (with approximately 5%-10% of the forest area still to be further clarified), a rough figure has been obtained, which is approximately 766 million hectares, which greatly exceeds previous estimates. Forest surveys have discovered many areas with abundant forest resources, such as Yunnan, Altai Mountains, and Helan Mountains, discovered many timbers with high economic value, and conducted afforestation survey designs for many barren mountains and bare ridges. In September of this year, the secret of Taibai Mountain in western Qinling was uncovered; the largest virgin forest in the northwest, the Bailong River, which has been sleeping for thousands of years, will begin logging next year.

    我国造林事业的空前成就
    五年来造林一千多万公顷
    许多地方水土流失风沙为害的情况改变了；数以千计的村庄绿化了
    据新华社8日讯　据林业部统计，五年来全国造林共达一千零三十二万多公顷，超过第一个五年计划指标71％；五年所造的林，比国民党统治时期所造的林多三十多倍，约为我国现有森林总面积的七分之一。五年来森林防护工作和调查工作也有很大的成就。
    为了培植森林工业的后备基地，新造的林以用材林为最多。营造用材林以林木生长较快的南方十二省为主，共营造了四百七十四万多公顷。三十年后，这些新林就可以出材八·五亿立方公尺左右。其次，五年来国家在向来受风沙威胁和水土流失严重的地区，共营造了二百六十四万多公顷的防护林和水源林，并封山抚育了大量林木。其中主要的有河南东部、东北西部、内蒙古东部、陕西北部、河西走廊等地营造的防风防沙林。河南东部的防护林，使昔日荒凉的黄河旧道变成了绿色的平原，保护了十七万公顷农田，并使四万公顷沙荒可以利用。各地还营造了一百九十万多公顷的油茶、油桐、生漆、核桃、八角、玉桂等经济林，其中，桐油产量恢复到接近战前的水平。
    五年来，全国形成了史无前例的植树造林热潮，从新疆的吐鲁番到福建的海滩，从内蒙古到海南岛，出现了许多“青年林”、“妇女林”，许多地方裸石露岩、水土流失、风沙为害的情况改变了，数以千计的村庄绿化了。
    解放前由于乱砍滥伐，加上森林火灾和虫害，我国森林面积是逐步减少的。解放初期，由于国家急需木材和植树造林赶不上采伐，森林面积缩减的情况仍然存在。但是第一个五年计划时期中造林的结果，这种情况有所改善。五年来不仅造林成绩大，国家还把全国主要林区管理起来了，作了二千零一万公顷森林的经理调查，编制了长白山、小兴安岭、岷江上游林区的经理施业案，正在编制着大兴安岭、牡丹江、大小金川、白龙江、秦岭、海南岛等林区的经理施业案。森林防护工作也在不断加强，除不断增建了许多森林管理所和修建林区公路、电话线等一般防护设施外，还建立了火险天气预报站和化学灭火站五十余处，每当春秋山火危险季节，主要林区上空还有护林飞机巡逻。五年来治松毛虫害的森林面积达到七十七万公顷，等于1952年的七倍，竹蝗发生面积也大大缩小。
    我国森林面积究竟有多少，它的蓄积量怎样，国民党统治时期是没有弄清楚的，解放后，经过我们几年调查（还有约5％—10％的林区待继续查清），得到了一个大概数，约为七千六百六十万公顷，这大大超过过去所估计的数字。森林调查，探明了云南、阿尔泰山、贺兰山等许多林源丰富的地区，发现了许多有很高经济价值的木材，并对许多荒山秃岭作出造林调查设计。今年9月，又揭开了秦岭西太白山的秘密；沉睡千百年的西北最大的白龙江原始森林，明年就要开始采伐。
