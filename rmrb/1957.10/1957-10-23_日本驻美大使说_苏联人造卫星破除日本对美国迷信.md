Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 22nd: Japanese Ambassador to the United States, Koichiro Asakai, said in a television interview on the 20th that the Soviet Union's launch of an artificial satellite "shattered" Japan's belief that the United States was superior to the Soviet Union in science. He said: "The Soviet satellite has made a deep impression on people regarding the effectiveness of Soviet science."

Speaking about the U.S. military stationed in Japan, Asakai Koichiro said that from the viewpoint of Japan's "national honor," the U.S. military stationed in Japan should be withdrawn. He pointed out: "No nation likes foreign troops to remain on its soil for too long."
