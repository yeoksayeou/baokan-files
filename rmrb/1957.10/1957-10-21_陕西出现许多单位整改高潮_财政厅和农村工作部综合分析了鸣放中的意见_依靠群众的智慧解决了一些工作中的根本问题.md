    Editor's Note: Among the news that more than half of the Shaanxi Province and Xi'an City-level government agencies have entered the stage mainly focused on rectification, it is particularly noteworthy that units such as the Shaanxi Provincial Department of Finance and the Provincial Party Committee Rural Work Department have seriously handled the opinions of the masses, ensuring that every matter is addressed and every point is explained. Furthermore, they have comprehensively analyzed the opinions of the masses, extracted several fundamental issues from them, and handed them over to the masses for discussion, fully utilizing the wisdom of the masses and relying on the strength of the masses to find solutions. This approach tells us that in handling the opinions of the masses during rectification, we should not be satisfied with simply processing a certain percentage of opinions by number, but should pay attention to improving the quality of handling.

    Xi'an Dispatch, October 20th – In Shaanxi Province and Xi'an City-level government agencies, more than half have successively entered the third stage of the rectification movement, which focuses on rectifying work style and improving work, and many units have already experienced a high tide of rectification.

    In the initial stage of the rectification campaign, the "Great Blooming and Contending," and the stage of the struggle against rightists, most government agencies adhered to the principle of "rectifying while correcting." Therefore, before entering the third stage of rectification, these agencies had already addressed an average of 50% of the opinions raised by the masses, with some better-performing units addressing over 80%. However, the issues addressed during this period were mostly relatively easy to solve, such as welfare, the relationship between leading cadres and the masses, and so on.

    During the rectification stage, a relatively significant characteristic of Shaanxi Province and Xi'an City-level government agencies is the adoption of the mass line approach to solving problems, fully mobilizing the masses to discuss various opinions, focusing on criticizing the bureaucratic, sectarian, and subjectivist styles of leadership, and researching and proposing solutions. The Shaanxi Provincial Department of Finance, the CCP Shaanxi Provincial Committee Rural Work Department, the Provincial People's Bank, and the Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative have done relatively well in this regard.

    The Provincial Department of Finance has been in the rectification stage for more than a month, and all staff members have participated in the major discussions on improving work. Some issues have been repeatedly discussed by the masses four or five times, and many new opinions continue to be put forward. When the rectification entered the third stage, the leading personnel of the Department of Finance explained the results of solving problems in the previous period. About 80% of the 1,199 opinions raised by the masses had been addressed. The leading personnel also examined bureaucracy, sectarianism, and subjectivism, and asked the masses to continue to "bloom and contend" in the rectification stage, criticize the leadership, and offer suggestions for improving work. Immediately afterward, the leadership summarized the opinions raised by the masses according to the nature of the problems into seventeen fundamental issues, such as the implementation of policies, streamlining the organization, the functions and powers of various sections, and cadres participating in production. These issues were then discussed widely among all staff members. After group and plenary discussions, a consensus was reached, and preliminary solutions were proposed. Currently, the proposed solutions include: the division of responsibilities among various sections, dormitory management and allocation, six regulations on cadres going deep into the grassroots, and preliminary opinions on giving play to collective leadership and improving the quality of department meetings. While discussing, all staff members continued to put forward nearly a hundred new opinions on the work. The leadership of the Department of Finance has decided to make another self-criticism in the next two days based on the opinions raised by the masses during the discussion, encouraging everyone to make more in-depth exposures and criticisms.

    Since entering the rectification stage in mid-September, the CCP Shaanxi Provincial Committee Rural Work Department has studied and prioritized the opinions raised by the masses one by one. The rectification leading group, department affairs meetings, and party branch committee meetings of the department have conducted multiple discussions and studies. Then, the person in charge of the department reported to all personnel. In the report, he reviewed some shortcomings in the past work, proposed directions for solving some major problems, and put forward specific suggestions for handling some problems that could be solved immediately, so that everyone could discuss them further. Through multiple group discussions and plenary debates, the preliminary opinions put forward by the leadership were further supplemented and revised, and the shortcomings in the work continued to be exposed and criticized. For example, some comrades pointed out in the plenary discussion that in the past, the research work of the Rural Work Department was all conducted in the Guanzhong area, and the situation in the Guanzhong Plain was used to guide the work in the mountainous and remote areas of southern and northern Shaanxi. Many places were not practical. It was suggested that in the future, the investigation and research on the work in southern and northern Shaanxi should be strengthened. Based on the opinions of the masses, the leadership of the Rural Work Department revised the original draft plan for improving work, determined the plan for improving work, and has begun to work according to this plan. In order to strengthen the leadership of the work in mountainous areas, the organizational structure was adjusted. Under the principle of not increasing the number of staff, a special office was designated to lead the work in forestry, animal husbandry, mountainous area production, and water conservancy. Ten regions were identified as key areas for investigation and research, including mountainous areas, plains, grain-producing areas, and cash crop areas. Now, except for some cadres' ideological style problems that will continue to be examined in depth by themselves during the rectification, all the problems raised by the masses in the "blooming and contending" have been resolved.

    The ongoing Shaanxi Provincial Party Committee Enlarged Meeting pointed out when discussing the rectification issue that the practices of the Provincial Department of Finance and the Provincial Party Committee Rural Work Department were relatively good. At the same time, it also pointed out that the leading personnel of some units have insufficient understanding of the importance of rectification work. Therefore, the rectification work of these units has been weak and slow.

    陕西出现许多单位整改高潮
    财政厅和农村工作部综合分析了鸣放中的意见
    依靠群众的智慧解决了一些工作中的根本问题
    编者按  在陕西省和西安市级机关已有二分之一以上转入以整改为主阶段的消息中，特别值得提起注意的，是陕西省财政厅和省委农村工作部等单位，对群众的意见进行了认真的处理，作到了件件有着落，条条有交代；并且把群众的意见加以综合分析，从中提出几个带根本性质的问题，交给群众讨论，充分发挥群众的智慧，依靠群众的力量，找到了解决问题的方案。这种做法告诉了我们，在整改中处理群众的意见，不能满足于按条数处理了百分之几十的数目字，而应该注意提高处理的质量。
    本报西安20日电  陕西省和西安市级机关单位的整风运动，已有二分之一以上相继转入以整顿作风、改进工作为主要内容的第三阶段，并且有不少单位已经出现了整改的高潮。
    大部分机关单位，在初期的整风大鸣大放阶段，和反击右派斗争阶段，都坚持了边整边改的方针，因此，在进入整风第三阶段以前，这些机关已经处理了的问题平均达到群众所提意见的50％，有些做得较好的单位达到80％以上。不过，这一时期所处理的问题，多数是属于生活福利、领导干部和群众关系等比较容易解决的问题。
    在整改阶段中，陕西省和西安市级机关中一个比较显著的特点，是对解决问题采取了群众路线的方针，充分发动群众对各种意见进行讨论，着重批判领导上的官僚主义、宗派主义、主观主义等思想作风，并且研究、提出了解决问题的方案。在这方面做得比较好的有陕西省财政厅、中共陕西省委农村工作部、省人民银行和省供销社等单位。
    省财政厅进入整改阶段已一个多月，机关全体人员都参加了改进工作的大讨论。有些问题，群众反复讨论了四、五次，而且继续提出很多新的意见。财政厅领导人员在整风进入第三阶段时，就把前一时期解决问题的结果作了交代，群众提的一千一百九十九条意见中，约有80％的意见已经作了处理。领导人员还检查了官僚主义、宗派主义和主观主义，要求群众在整改阶段继续大鸣大放，批评领导，并对工作提出改进意见。紧接着，领导上把群众所提出的意见按问题的性质归纳成贯彻执行政策、精简机构、各科室职权、干部参加生产等十七个带根本性质的问题，在全体工作人员中展开广泛的讨论。经过小组和大会讨论，取得了一致意见，提出了解决问题的初步方案。目前，已经提出来的方案有：各科室业务划分，宿舍管理和分配，关于干部深入下层工作的六条规定，关于发挥集体领导作用、提高厅务会议质量的初步意见等。在讨论的同时，全体工作人员继续对工作提出了近百条新的意见。财政厅领导上已决定在最近两天，根据群众在讨论问题的时候所提的意见再作一次检讨，鼓励大家更深刻地进行揭发和批判。
    中共陕西省委农村工作部从9月中旬进入整改阶段以来，领导上对群众所提的意见逐条进行了研究、排队，归纳成七个主要的问题，由部的整风领导小组、部务会议和党支委会议进行了多次讨论研究，然后由部的负责同志向全体人员作报告。在报告中，对过去工作中的一些缺点作了检讨，并就一些重大问题提出了解决的方向，对一些能够马上解决的问题，提出了具体处理意见，让大家进一步讨论。通过多次小组讨论和大会争辩，进一步补充和修正了领导上提出的初步意见，并且对工作中的缺点继续进行了揭发和批评。如有些同志在大会讨论时提出，过去农村工作部的调查研究工作都是在关中地区，用关中平原的情况指导陕南和陕北山区和边远地区的工作，有很多地方不切合实际，建议今后加强对陕南、陕北地区工作情况的调查研究。农村工作部领导上就根据群众的意见修改了原先提出的改进工作草案，确定了改进工作方案，并且已经开始根据这个方案进行工作。为了加强对山区工作的领导，调整了组织机构，在不增加编制的原则下，专门指定一个处来领导林、牧、山区生产、水利等工作；确定了十个地区为调查研究重点地区，其中包括山区，也包括平川，包括产粮区，也包括经济作物区。现在，这个部除了有些干部的思想作风问题将由本人在整风中继续深入检查外，群众在鸣放中提出来的问题，已全部得到解决。
    正在举行的陕西省委扩大会议在讨论整风问题的时候，指出省财政厅和省委农村工作部等单位的作法是比较好的；同时也指出有些单位的领导人员对整改工作的重要意义认识不足，因此，这些单位的整改工作表现得无力和迟缓。
