　　Advanced Soviet Science is Our Example
　　Wang Ganchang
    In the year I spent working and studying at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research, my frequent contact with Soviet scientists allowed me to further understand their achievements in various fields and the reasons behind these achievements.
    As everyone knows, in the early days of the October Revolution, Soviet science and technology was backward due to the evil legacy of the Tsarist regime. Only about twenty years ago, Soviet science was far behind the United States. One physics professor told me that at the start of the Patriotic War, there were only about one hundred physicists in the Soviet Union. During the Patriotic War, the western regions of the Soviet Union's cultural and industrial centers were cruelly destroyed by the fascist bandits, and it took a long period to recover after the war. In contrast, the United States was not only unaffected by the war, but also took advantage of the economic depression and political instability in Western Europe during and after the war, to recruit a large number of Western European scientists, especially German and Italian scientists, to build up American science. Therefore, the situation in the Soviet Union at that time was inferior to that of the United States. But this situation was only temporary. In the postwar period, thanks to the timely and vigorous development of science by the Soviet Party and government, the careful formulation of various plans, and the active cultivation of young scientists, extremely rich fruits have been obtained today. They now have many scientists who are in the prime of their lives and are actively working. Some of these young scientists work under the leadership of older generations of scientists, while others are able to work independently or lead younger scientific workers. They are all the core force of current Soviet scientific work. As for the younger generation, the number is of course greater, and they are all very good in terms of quality and academic performance. They will soon shoulder more and more important responsibilities for developing science. I believe that, at least in physics, the Soviet young and younger generations of experts can be compared with the United States in terms of quality and quantity, and may even have surpassed the United States, while the speed of manpower growth greatly exceeds that of the United States. From the content of scientific journals, it can also be clearly seen that Soviet scientific workers are growing at a considerable rate. Taking only the journal "Theoretical and Experimental Physics" as an example, its length was still very short three or four years ago, but in the past year, the length has almost more than doubled compared to three years ago, and the content has almost more than doubled (in order to prevent the length from becoming too large, each article is published after being shortened by the editorial department). A professor once told me: Soviet physics is advancing at a tremendous rate. Last year there was significant progress compared to the year before, and this year there has been a big step forward compared to last year.
    From the various new achievements of Soviet science, it can be even more clearly seen that Soviet science is advancing by leaps and bounds. In recent years, the Soviet Union has built the world's first nuclear power plant, is now successfully building the world's first nuclear-powered icebreaker, has produced the first jet airliner, has built the world's largest energy synchrophasotron, and has recently successfully tested an intercontinental ballistic missile and successfully launched the world's first artificial earth satellite. Soviet theoretical physicists have also solved the problem of superconductors, which the world has been trying to solve for decades. This series of scientific achievements obtained by the Soviet Union in a short period of time is something that the United States and any capitalist country do not have.
    As for the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research, we have found that among the Soviet scientists here, in addition to a few leaders who have obviously made academic contributions, the foundations of the general young scientific workers are also very solid. At the three or four academic discussions held every week, these young scientists can eloquently explain a lot of principles, and often debate with the leaders or with each other without any worries, and sometimes the winners of the debates are themselves. This atmosphere of open discussion and arguing based on reason is a very important factor in improving academic standards. In addition, they are particularly sensitive to new things. Whether in the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research, in the Soviet Union, or in other countries, any new, even very small, discovery or achievement is immediately brought up for discussion. First, the accuracy of these achievements is judged, and then research is conducted on how to promote and develop these achievements. This is also an extremely important point in scientific research.
    Furthermore, the two accelerators here can also demonstrate the high level of Soviet science and technology. The synchrophasotron that produces 10 billion electron volts, from the discovery of the principle to the completion of manufacturing, was entirely undertaken by Soviet scientists and engineers. As everyone knows, the principle of the synchrophasotron is a type of high-energy circular accelerator, and the general principle of high-energy circular accelerators was first discovered by the famous Soviet scientist Professor Veksler in 1944. Based on his principle, the Soviet Union has manufactured several electron synchrotrons with energies above 100 million electron volts, and the current proton synchrophasotron with 10 billion electron volts is another great achievement of Soviet scientists and engineers. The reason why it can be completed relatively quickly is because Soviet engineers and scientists have high theoretical and technical levels. The scale of this accelerator is unprecedentedly large (the magnet weighs 36,000 tons, the diameter is 56 meters, and the cross section of the vacuum chamber is 2 meters by 0.4 meters), but the requirements for accuracy are not reduced because of this. Whether it is the design and manufacture of magnets, power supply, vacuum injection high frequency, etc., they are all unprecedented and must be created by experts in various fields. From this point, it can be seen that in the current atomic age, any creative scientific undertaking must rely on many people with high scientific levels to complete. Synchrophasotrons are like this, and intercontinental missiles and artificial earth satellites are also like this.
    The other synchrocyclotron at this institute is also the world's best in its type. It was completed in 1949 and has been gradually improved since then. It can now produce protons with 680 million electron volts. So far, many physicists have done a series of important work on this accelerator. Because this accelerator is manufactured perfectly and designed thoughtfully, the working time per week is 140 hours, exceeding the working time of any other similar accelerator. In addition, all its equipment, including experimental instruments and other accessories of the accelerator, are also very strong and precise. Many American scientists who came to attend the Moscow High Energy Conference last summer visited and praised this accelerator, and sighed that they were not as good.
    I admire the rapid progress of Soviet science and technology very much. And the current rapid progress of Soviet science is only the beginning, and it will surely be even more amazing in the future. What is the reason for such rapid progress? There is no doubt that this is due to the superiority of the socialist system. Only when the power is in the hands of the people can we formulate and implement various plans in a guided, organized, and focused manner, based on the needs of the country and the people and proceeding from actual conditions, so that science can develop at the fastest speed. The path taken by Soviet science is the only path that our Chinese science should take, and that is the path of socialism.
    Another profound feeling we have in the Soviet Union is the constant care and unlimited enthusiasm of Soviet scientists for us. Just taking work at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research as an example, generally speaking, our academic level is far inferior to that of Soviet scientists, but they attach great importance to any small achievements we make in our work. They often use various methods to help us, encourage us, and hope that our work will achieve good results.
    The great October Revolution has opened up such a brilliant future for Soviet science. Our Chinese scientific workers must follow Chairman Mao's instructions and learn advanced Soviet science humbly and conscientiously. I believe that as long as we advance along the road of socialism and unswervingly learn from the Soviet Union, our scientific cause will surely reach the world level in the next twelve years.

　　先进的苏联科学事业是我们的榜样
　　王淦昌
    我在联合核子研究所参加工作和学习的一年中，由于和苏联科学家们的频繁接触，对于他们各方面的成就以及其获得这些成就的原因有进一步的了解。
    大家知道，在十月革命初期，由于沙皇政权留下的恶果，苏联的科学技术是落后的。就在二十年前左右，苏联的科学还远不如美国。有一位物理学教授曾对我谈起，在卫国战争开始时，苏联的物理学家只有一百名左右。在卫国战争期间，苏联的文化和工业中心的西部地区遭到法西斯匪帮的残酷破坏，战后须经一个长的时期才能恢复。相反的，美国不仅没受到战争的影响，而且利用当时西欧战时和战后的经济萧条、政局动荡不安，收罗了一大批西欧的，特别是德国和意大利的科学家，用来建立美国的科学。因此当时苏联所处的景况是不如美国的。但是这种景况只是暂时的。战后时期，由于苏联党和政府及时和大力地发展科学，周密地制订各种计划，积极培养年青科学家，到今天已获得极为丰富的果实。他们现在已经有不少的年富力强、工作积极的科学家。这些青年科学家们，有的在年长一辈科学家的领导下进行工作，有的已能独立工作，或者领导更年青的科学工作者，他们都是目前苏联科学工作的核心力量。至于更年青的一代，人数当然更多，他们不论在品质上和学业上都是很好的。他们不久将负担起更多更重要的发展科学的责任。我相信，至少在物理学上，苏联年青一代的和更年青一代的专家们，无论在质的方面或量的方面，都可以同美国相比，甚至已超过了美国，而就人力增长的速度来讲，则大大超过了美国。从科学期刊的内容上，也可以很清楚地看出来，苏联的科学工作者是以相当高的速度增长着的。仅就“理论实验物理”这一个期刊来说，在三、四年前，它的篇幅还是很少的，但最近一年来，篇幅几乎比三年前增加了一倍以上，内容则几乎超过了两倍（由于使篇幅不致过于庞大，每篇文章都是经过编辑部压缩得很短以后才出版的）。一位教授曾和我谈过：苏联的物理学正在以极大的速度向前推进着，去年比前年有显著的进步，今年又比去年进了一大步。
    从苏联科学的各种新成就来看，可以更加明显地看出苏联科学的突飞猛进。近年来，苏联建成了世界第一个原子能发电站，现在又正在成功地制造着世界上第一艘原子破冰船，首次制成了喷气式客机，首次建成了世界上最大能量的同步稳相加速器，最近又首次试验成功洲际弹道导弹和成功地发射了世界上第一颗人造地球卫星。苏联理论物理学家又解决了几十年来世界上一直力求解决的超导体问题。苏联这一系列在短期内获得的科学上的成就，是美国和任何资本主义国家都没有的。
    就联合核子研究所来说，我们发现在这里的苏联科学家们中，除几位领导者很明显地在学术上已经很有贡献外，而一般年青科学工作者的基础也都是很坚实的。在每星期大小三四个学术讨论会上，这些年轻的科学家都能滔滔不绝地讲出一番道理，经常毫无顾虑地和领导们或在相互之间展开辩论，而辩论的胜利者，有时也就是他们自己。这种展开讨论、据理力争的风气，是提高学术水平的非常重要的因素。此外，他们对于新鲜事物的敏感程度也特别的大。无论在联合核子研究所内，苏联国内或各国有任何新的，那怕是很小的发现或成就，必定立即提出讨论。首先判断这些成就的确切性，然后研究如何把这些成就加以发扬光大。这也是研究科学极其重要的一点。
    再就这里的两个加速器来说，也可以表现苏联科学技术水平的高超。产生一百亿电子伏特的同步稳相加速器，从原理的发现一直到制造完成，完全是由苏联科学家和工程师担负起来的。大家都已知道，同步稳相加速器的原理是高能圜形加速器的一种，而高能圜形加速器的普遍原理，是由苏联著名科学家维克斯勒教授在1944年首先发现的。基于他的这个原理，苏联已制造了几个能量在一亿电子伏特以上的电子同步加速器，而目前这个一百亿电子伏特的质子同步稳相加速器是苏联科学家和工程师集体创作的又一个巨大成就。它所以能比较迅速地完成，就是因为苏联工程师和科学家们具有高超的理论和技术水平。这个加速器的规模空前庞大（磁铁重三万六千吨，直径为五十六公尺，真空匣的切面为两公尺乘零点四公尺），但对精确程度的要求，并不因此而减低。无论是磁铁的设计和制造、电源供应、真空入射高频等，都是以前所没有的、都得由各方面的专家们创造出来。从这一点可以看出，在目前原子时代里，无论那一样创造性的科学事业，必须依靠多方面的具有高超的科学水平的人来完成。同步稳相加速器是这样的，洲际导弹和人造地球卫星也都是这样的。
    这个研究所的另外一架同步回旋加速器，也是在同类型的加速器中占世界第一位。它在1949年已经完成，其后逐渐加以改进，现在已能产生六亿八千万电子伏特的质子。到现在为止，很多物理学家已经在这个加速器上做出一系列的重要工作。由于这个加速器制造得完善，设计周到，每星期的工作时间，是一百四十小时，超过任何其他同类型加速器的工作时间。此外，它的一切设备，包括实验仪器和加速器的其他附件在内，也都是非常坚固和精确的。去年夏季来参加莫斯科高能量会议的许多美国科学家参观以后，对于这个加速器赞赏不已，并且自叹不如。
    我是十二万分钦佩苏联科学技术的飞速进展。而目前苏联科学的飞速进展只在开始，将来必定更为惊人。这样飞速的进展，究竟是什么原因呢？毫无疑问，这是由于社会主义制度的优越性。只有当政权掌握在人民手里，才可以按国家和人民的需要，从实际情况出发，有领导、有组织、有重点地制定和执行各期计划，使科学能以最快的速度发展。苏联科学所走的道路，也就是我们中国科学所唯一应该走的道路，这就是社会主义的道路。
    我们在苏联另一点深刻的感受，是苏联科学家们对我们的不断关怀和无限热情。就在联合核子研究所内工作而论，一般来讲，我们每个人的学术水平，是远不如苏联科学家的，但是他们对我们在工作中的任何一点小小的成就都十分重视。他们常用种种方法来帮助我们，鼓励我们，希望我们的工作得到好的成绩。
    伟大的十月革命给苏联科学开辟了这样光辉灿烂的前途，我们中国的科学工作者一定要遵照毛主席的指示，虚心地、认真地学习苏联先进科学。我相信只要沿着社会主义的道路前进，坚定不移地向苏联学习，在今后十二年内我国的科学事业一定会达到世界水平的。
