    This type of waterwheel was invented by Duan Xu of Lanzhou during the Jiajing reign of the Ming Dynasty. Nowadays, in many places along the Yellow River in Gansu Province, this type of waterwheel is used to draw water for irrigating farmland.

    水车
    这种水车，是明朝嘉靖年间兰州人段续创造的。现在，甘肃沿黄河两岸的许多地方，都是利用这种水车引水灌溉农田。
