Assisting Grassroots in Carrying Out the Socialist Education Movement
Anhui Provincial Party Committee Decides to Transfer Nine Hundred Cadres

    (By Our Staff Reporter) The Anhui Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has decided to transfer nine hundred cadres from provincial-level organizations to rural areas and factories to assist grassroots party organizations in launching a large-scale socialist ideological education movement. Of the seven hundred and eighty cadres going to the countryside, more than one-third are leading cadres at the section and bureau chief level or above, including five members of the Provincial Party Committee Standing Committee, six members of the Provincial Party Committee, and eighteen ministers, department directors, and bureau directors. Most of these cadres are leading backbone elements and activists in the anti-rightist struggle during the big contending and big blooming campaign in the organizations. On September 24, the first batch of eighty cadres who are assigned to work in the countryside had already left, and the second batch of seven hundred cadres who are assigned to work in the countryside, and one hundred and twenty cadres who are assigned to work in factories, will depart soon.
    Before dispatching a large number of cadres to the countryside and factories, the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party had already sent working groups to different types of agricultural cooperatives and several factories to assist local party organizations in carrying out pilot work for the socialist debate, and studied the experience of these pilots, in preparation for the comprehensive launch of the socialist debate in rural areas and factories.

    在派遣大批干部下乡下厂以前，中共安徽省委早就派出工作组到不同类型的农业合作社和几个工厂里去，协助当地党组织开展社会主义大辩论的试点工作，并研究了这些试点的经验，为在农村和工厂全面开展社会主义大辩论作好了准备工作。
