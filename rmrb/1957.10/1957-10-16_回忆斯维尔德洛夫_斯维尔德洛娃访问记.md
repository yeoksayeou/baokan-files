　　Remembering Sverdlov
　　——An Interview with Sverdlova
    By Our Correspondent　Dai Feng
    The scenery in the suburbs of Moscow is beautiful, and the cool air is filled with tranquility. White birch trees stand tall among the continuous green pines and cypresses, and gusts of breeze rustle the leaves. After an hour and a half on the straight and flat road, the car made a sharp turn, taking us into a lush forest, and stopped in front of a row of low wooden fences. Through the dense old pine trees, we saw a light blue single-story wooden house. Klavdiya Timofeyevna Sverdlova, the wife of Sverdlov, one of the outstanding organizers of the Bolshevik Party and the first chairman of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee of Soviets of Workers' and Peasants' Deputies, is enjoying her later years here.

    On the eve of the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution, Sverdlov's son accompanied us on a visit here.

    At that time, Sverdlova was resting on a wooden stool in the small garden covered with green grass. When she saw us, she walked briskly to greet us, shook our hands warmly, and invited us to sit in the living room.

    Klavdiya Timofeyevna Sverdlova is an old Bolshevik. She joined the Communist Party in 1904. She was an active participant in the first Russian Revolution of 1905 and the Great October Revolution of 1917. In 1905, she was elected by the Ural regional party organization as a delegate to the Fourth All-Russian Party Congress, where she first met Lenin. During the arduous revolutionary struggle, she was arrested and exiled more than once. After the victory of the October Revolution, she worked in the Secretariat of the Party Central Committee. She is now eighty-one years old, her hair is snow-white, and her eyesight has deteriorated somewhat, but she is still in good spirits.

    Sverdlova sat down on the sofa by the window, adjusted the corner of her shawl, and slowly began to talk to us. She said, "On the occasion of the fortieth anniversary of the victory of the October Revolution, let us first talk about Yakov Mikhailovich Sverdlov! You already know that Sverdlov, together with comrades like Lenin, organized and led the October Revolution, which allowed the proletariat to achieve revolutionary victory for the first time in human history. Lenin called Sverdlov a genius revolutionary organizer. He said: 'Sverdlov is the eternal symbol of a revolutionary's loyalty to his cause.'"

    "...After the victory of the October Revolution, Sverdlov was elected as the first chairman of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee of Soviets of Workers' and Peasants' Deputies. The revolution had triumphed, but the civil war continued, and the national economy was severely damaged. The lives of the working people were impoverished. During this period, Sverdlov, like Lenin, worked from early morning until one or two o'clock in the morning, sometimes even later, for the victory at the front and the recovery of the economy in the rear. In addition to personally leading and handling the work of the Party and diplomatic and military issues, they also personally managed finances. Hundreds of thousands of rubles could only be spent after Sverdlov personally signed them. The work was heavy, but Sverdlov never delayed the problems and documents that should be solved and approved that day until the next day. Sverdlov had no personal secretary, and every minute of the working day had to be carefully calculated. After finishing the day's work late at night, he would take out a small notebook and write down his work plan for the next day: going to the factory, giving reports, meeting with the masses, etc."

    "Yakov Mikhailovich always personally received more than a dozen people from all over the country every day." Sverdlova took off her black-rimmed glasses, looked at us deeply, and continued, "When he talked to working people from all walks of life, he always listened carefully first, and then briefly explained his own opinions. The two sides of the conversation were as harmonious as brothers."

    In 1918, the Party Central Committee and the All-Russian Central Executive Committee of Soviets of Workers' and Peasants' Deputies moved from Petrograd (Leningrad) to Moscow. On the way to Moscow, Sverdlov and his wife did not bring a single piece of bedding or a suitcase. Sverdlov's only possessions were a suit and an old overcoat he was wearing, and a change of shirt. This old overcoat was given to Sverdlov by a soldier in 1909. Sverdlov cherished it and wore it until 1920. After Sverdlov's death, the old overcoat was transferred to Mitrofanov, a member of the Soviet of Workers' and Peasants' Deputies.

    Talking about Sverdlov's overcoat, Sverdlov's son, who was sitting next to her, interrupted his mother and interjected, "After the victory of the revolution, my father never added any new clothes. He never had a second pair of glasses in his life. Now museums everywhere often receive a large number of letters from the masses asking to exhibit Sverdlov's relics, but we really can't find them..."

    Winter came in 1918, and it was bitterly cold. In Moscow, a search was launched to seize the surplus winter clothes of the bourgeoisie. One day, Malinkov, the commander of the Kremlin guard, sent a batch of cotton clothes that had been confiscated and were to be sent to the Red Army soldiers at the front to the Kremlin for Sverdlov to inspect. The kind-hearted Malinkov saw that Sverdlov's overcoat was tattered and could not withstand the cold wind, so he said to Sverdlov, "Let me keep one for you!"

    Sverdlov's face suddenly became very stern. He said, "The cotton clothes we confiscated from the capitalists are not for me." Sverdlov righteously refused.

      "Yakov was the most upright person." Sverdlova continued her reminiscences while inviting us to have some refreshments, "He never allowed anyone to waste public property. I remember that he criticized Bukharin, Kamenev, and others more than once for their behavior of using public office for private gain and being particular about their clothing."

    When Sverdlov first arrived in Moscow, because he had no bedding or supplies with him, he could only live in the "National" Hotel opposite the Kremlin. Lenin also lived there. They both walked to and from work. In Sverdlov's office and dormitory, meetings of Soviet ministers, generals, and party and government leaders were often held. Sverdlov never used a single ruble of public funds to buy teacups, so when meetings were held, the people attending the meetings could only share a broken teacup to drink water. So everyone joked: Sverdlov is the poor president of the Soviet. At that time, Sverdlov's monthly salary was the same as that of a worker, and the entire salary was only enough to cover the cost of food. He ate in the cadre public canteen every day, and sometimes there was not enough bread, and he starved with everyone. Funa Zotseva, the administrator of the Kremlin cadre canteen, was very concerned about Sverdlov's health and occasionally sent some food to his home, which was criticized and stopped by Sverdlov.

    Once, Sverdlov went to the canteen to eat and ordered vegetable soup and black bread. At this time, his daughter Vella came to the canteen to find her father. When she saw her father eating, she clamored to eat too. Funa Zotseva casually brought Vella a bowl of soup. Sverdlov stopped her and said, "Vella has no right to eat in the cadre canteen, understand?" Then he asked Funa Zotseva for an extra spoon, and the father and daughter shared a bowl of vegetable soup. The young Vella was ignorant and ate more than half of it by herself. In this way, Sverdlov had to go hungry again, and happily led Vella out of the canteen.

    "The October Revolution has been victorious for forty years. Forty years, this is a course of arduous and great struggle." Sverdlova continued to recall: "In the early days of the victory of the revolution, our tasks were even more arduous. In order not to let the young Soviet be strangled by the demons of hunger and cold, we had to be diligent and thrifty, and save money to accumulate funds and build the country. At that time, leading comrades such as Lenin and Sverdlov were all working tirelessly, and no one thought that they should enjoy themselves after the victory of the revolution. We believed that only by building socialism first with hardship could we have infinite happiness in the future. Although we experienced countless difficulties and many critical moments, Sverdlov, like other leading comrades, never fell into pessimism and despair. In sharing weal and woe, the love and sincere friendship between comrades were further enhanced."

    "During the period when food was difficult in Moscow and Leningrad and other regions, comrades far away from Moscow were deeply concerned about Lenin and Sverdlov. Comrades returning from the front, from Siberia, Central Asia, and the southern regions to Moscow, always brought one or two cans, some food, flour, meat, and fruit with them. Once, a large bear's leg was brought to Sverdlov from far away Siberia after traveling through thousands of mountains and rivers. Old Bolshevik Banjiskin brought apples from Tula. When all these gifts were sent to Sverdlov's home, they were handled according to an old rule: first, the various gifts were placed on the table to count the number, and then, according to the number of comrades in the Kremlin who were sick and in poor health, they were divided into piles. So the next day, Sverdlov got up early, held the distributed food in his hands, and personally sent it to the comrades before going to work."

    Sverdlova paused slightly, leaned back and said: "Now, when I recall Yakov, I remember more affectionately what he often said: Thrift and economy are necessary conditions for building a socialist country. Forty years have passed, we have built socialism, and are advancing towards communism, and the country is becoming stronger and more prosperous, and the people are living a happy and joyful life."

    When we stood up to say goodbye, the sun was already setting. Sverdlova insisted on seeing us off at the gate. When we parted, she held our hands tightly and said: "Now the period in which you Chinese people are is similar to the early days of our construction of socialism. You have put forward the policy of building the country with diligence and thrift, which is completely correct. The Chinese people will surely win the construction of socialism, just as we have achieved the victory of building socialism."

　　回忆斯维尔德洛夫
　　——斯维尔德洛娃访问记
    本报记者　戴枫
    莫斯科的郊区景色优美，凉爽的空气中充满了寂静。一棵棵白桦树挺立在接连不断的苍松翠柏之间，阵阵微风吹得树叶簌簌作响。汽车在笔直平坦的公路上走了一个半小时后，拐了个陡弯，把我们带进一片葱郁的森林中，在一排矮木栅前停了下来。从密密层层的老松树的缝隙间，我们看见了一幢淡青色的单层木屋。布尔什维克党的优秀组织者之一，全俄工农苏维埃第一任主席斯维尔德洛夫的妻子克拉甫奇雅·季莫菲耶娃·斯维尔德洛娃就在这里欢度她的晚年。
    在十月革命四十周年的前夕，斯维尔德洛夫的儿子陪着我们来到这里访问。
    这时，斯维尔德洛娃正坐在绿草如茵的小花园的木凳上休息，见了我们，就健步地迎来，紧握我们的双手，让我们到客厅里坐。
    克拉甫奇雅·季莫菲耶娃·斯维尔德洛娃是一位老布尔什维克。1904年加入共产党。她是1905年第一次俄国革命和1917年伟大十月革命的积极参加者。1905年由乌拉尔地区党组织推选为出席全俄第四次党代会代表，在这次大会上，她第一次会见了列宁。在艰难的革命斗争过程中，她不止一次地被逮捕，被流放。十月革命胜利后，她一直在党中央书记处任职。今年她已经八十一岁了，头发雪白，视力有些衰退，但精神还很好。
    斯维尔德洛娃在靠窗的沙发上坐了下来，撩了撩披肩的一角，慢慢地同我们谈了起来。她说：“在十月革命胜利四十年的时候，还是先让我们谈谈雅科夫·米哈依洛维奇·斯维尔德洛夫吧！你们早就知道，斯维尔德洛夫和列宁等同志一起组织并领导了十月革命，使得无产阶级第一次在人类历史上取得了革命胜利。列宁称斯维尔德洛夫为天才的革命组织者。他说过：‘斯维尔德洛夫是革命者忠于自己事业的永恒的象征。’”
    “……十月革命胜利后，斯维尔德洛夫被选为第一任全俄工农苏维埃主席。革命胜利了，但国内战争继续着，国民经济遭到严重破坏。劳动人民生活贫苦。在这个时期，斯维尔德洛夫和列宁一样，为了前线胜利，为了恢复后方经济，每天从清早工作到深夜一两点，有时甚至更晚些。他们除了亲自领导和处理党的工作和外交、军事问题之外，还亲自管理财政。成千上百的卢布开支全由斯维尔德洛夫亲自签字后才能支出。工作是繁重的，但斯维尔德洛夫从来也没有把当天应该解决的问题和批示的文件拖延到第二天。斯维尔德洛夫没有私人秘书，工作日的每一分钟都要精打细算。深夜处理完了当天工作以后，就拿出小本子来，记下明天的工作计划：下工厂，做报告，接见群众等等。”
    “雅科夫·米哈依洛维奇每天总要亲自接见来自各地的十多个群众”。斯维尔德洛娃摘下黑边眼镜，深深地望了我们一眼，接着说：“他同各行各业的劳动人民晤谈时，总是先细心地倾听，然后概要地说明自己的意见。谈话双方融洽得像兄弟一样。”
    1918年，党中央和全俄工农苏维埃由彼得堡（列宁格勒）迁移到莫斯科。斯维尔德洛夫夫妇在来到莫斯科的路上，随身没有一件被褥，没有一只箱子。斯维尔德洛夫唯一的财产是穿在身上的一套西服和一件旧大衣，一套替换的衬衣。这件旧大衣还是1909年一个军人送给斯维尔德洛夫的。斯维尔德洛夫一直爱惜地穿到了1920年。这件旧大衣在斯维尔德洛夫死后又转送给了工农苏维埃委员米特洛富诺夫。
    谈到斯维尔德洛夫的大衣，坐在旁边的斯维尔德洛夫的儿子打断了母亲的话，插口说：“革命胜利后，我的父亲就没有增添过新衣服。他一生没有第二付眼镜。现在各地博物馆经常接到大批群众来信，要求展出斯维尔德洛夫的遗物，可是，我们实在找不出来……。”
    1918年冬天来了，严寒刺骨。在莫斯科发动了向资产阶级搜查存余的冬衣。一天，克里姆林宫警卫长官马林可夫把一部分查出来准备运给前线红军战士的棉衣送到克里姆林宫，请斯维尔德洛夫检查。好心的马林可夫见到斯维尔德洛夫穿的大衣破烂了，抵不住寒风，于是便对斯维尔德洛夫说：“给您留下一件吧！”
    斯维尔德洛夫顿时脸色变得十分严厉。他说：“我们从资本家那里没收来的棉衣，不是为了我。”斯维尔德洛夫严正地拒绝了。
      “雅科夫是最严正的人。”斯维尔德洛娃一面请我们吃点心，一面继续回忆着说：“他从不允许任何人浪费公家的财产。我记得他不止一次地严厉批评过布哈林、加米涅夫等假公济私、讲究穿着的行为。”
    斯维尔德洛夫初到莫斯科的时候，因为没有随身被褥用品，只能住在克里姆林宫对面的“民族”旅馆。列宁也住在那里。他们上下班都是步行。在斯维尔德洛夫的办公室里和宿舍里经常召集苏维埃部长们、将军们和党政负责人开会。斯维尔德洛夫没有用公家一个卢布买过茶杯，因此，开会时，参加会议的人们只能用一个破茶杯轮流喝水。于是大家开玩笑说：斯维尔德洛夫是苏维埃的穷总统。当时，斯维尔德洛夫的每月工资跟工人的工资一样，全部工资只够吃饭的费用。他每天在干部公共食堂吃饭，有时面包不够，他跟大家一起挨饿。克里姆林宫干部食堂管理员伏娜佐采娃非常关心斯维尔德洛夫的健康，偶尔给他家里送去一些食品，都受到了斯维尔德洛夫的批评和制止。
    有一次，斯维尔德洛夫到食堂吃饭，要了菜汤和黑面包。这时，他的女儿微拉来到食堂找爸爸，她一见父亲在吃饭，就吵着也要吃。伏娜佐采娃随手就给微拉端来了一碗汤。斯维尔德洛夫阻止她说：“微拉是没有权利在干部食堂吃饭的，懂吗？”随后就向伏娜佐采娃多要了一把匙子，父女俩人分吃一碗菜汤。年轻的小微拉不懂事，竟一个人吃了大半。这样斯维尔德洛夫只好又饿了一顿，愉快地领着微拉走出了食堂。
    “十月革命胜利已经四十年了。四十年，这是艰苦的伟大斗争的历程。”斯维尔德洛娃继续回忆着：“革命胜利初期，我们的任务更为繁重，为了不让年轻的苏维埃为饥寒的魔鬼所扼杀，我们就得勤俭刻苦，省吃俭用地积累资金，建设国家。当时，列宁和斯维尔德洛夫等领导同志都是一样孜孜不倦地工作，谁也没有想到革命胜利了就该享福了。我们相信，只有先艰苦一些建成了社会主义，将来才能幸福无穷。虽然经历了不知道多少困难，多少紧急的关头，斯维尔德洛夫与其他领导同志一样，从没有陷入过悲观失望。在同甘共苦之中，同志之间的热爱和真诚友谊更加增进了。”
    “在莫斯科和列宁格勒等地区粮食发生困难的时期，远离莫斯科的同志们一直深深地关切着列宁和斯维尔德洛夫。从前线回来的，从西伯利亚、中亚细亚和南部地区回到莫斯科的同志们，总会随身带来一两个罐头、一些食品、面粉、肉类和水果。有一次还从遥远的西伯利亚经过千山万水带给斯维尔德洛夫一只大熊腿。老布尔什维克班日斯金从土拉带来了苹果。所有这些礼品送到斯维尔德洛夫家里的时候，都按照一个老规矩办：先把各种礼品放到桌上清点数目，然后，根据克里姆林宫里有病的和健康不好的同志的数目，一堆堆分配好。于是第二天，斯维尔德洛夫早早起床，把分配好的食品捧在手里，在自己上班之前亲自给同志们送去。”
    斯维尔德洛娃稍停了一下，背向后靠了靠又说：“现在一回忆起雅科夫，我就更亲切地记起他经常说的话：勤俭节约是建成社会主义国家的必要条件。四十年过去了，我们建成了社会主义，正在向共产主义前进，国家一天天更强大繁荣，人民生活幸福愉快。”
    当我们站起来告别时，已是夕阳西下。斯维尔德洛娃一定要把我们送出大门口。分别的时候，她紧握住我们的手说：“现在你们中国人民所处的时期跟我们建设社会主义初期相仿。你们提出了勤俭建国的方针，这是完全正确的。中国人民建设社会主义一定会胜利，正像我们取得了建成社会主义的胜利一样。”
