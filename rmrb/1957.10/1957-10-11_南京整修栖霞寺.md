Nanjing Renovates Qixia Temple

Qixia Temple on Qixia Mountain in Nanjing, a nationally renowned temple, has suffered from disrepair over the years, resulting in corrosion and alteration of some cultural relics, and the collapse and damage of individual buildings. The Nanjing Municipal People's Committee began renovations last month, starting with greening the environment, repairing roads, repairing stone bridges, the Lake Heart Pavilion, the Changguan Pavilion, stone benches and round tables, and building new square pavilions, etc., with plans to complete them by the time the maple leaves turn red. The next step will be to rebuild the Imperial Garden and other places.

    南京整修栖霞寺
    全国知名的南京栖霞山栖霞寺，因年久失修，致部分古物腐蚀变样，个别建筑倒塌败坏。南京市人民委员会已从上月开始动工修整，首先绿化环境，整修道路，修理石桥、湖心亭、畅观亭、石凳及圆桌，新建方亭等，计划到枫林醉红时即可完成。下一步再修建御花园等处。
