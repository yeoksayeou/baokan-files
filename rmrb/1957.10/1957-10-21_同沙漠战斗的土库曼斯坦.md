Soviet Republics

    Turkmenistan, in general, is a place with plenty of sunshine and little water in Central Asia, but Turkmenistan is the hottest and driest republic in Central Asia. The sunshine is very abundant here, there are very few rainy days, and the amount of evaporation is many times greater than the amount of rainfall. Although the Amu Darya River flows through eastern Turkmenistan, most of the republic is far from it and feels very water-scarce. In some parts of the west, distillers are even used to obtain fresh water from seawater, or fresh water is transported across the Caspian Sea from Baku. Nature's sunshine has not brought happiness to Turkmenistan, but deserts and arid grasslands that account for more than 90% of the republic's area.
    However, the "sunshine" of the October Revolution and the "sun" of the Communist Party brought warmth, happiness, and freedom to the people of Turkmenistan, and brought water.
    Before the revolution, Turkmenistan's only good land and water sources were in the hands of the big landlords. The Soviet regime gave the land and water to the peasants. After the land and water reform implemented from 1925 to 1927, 27,000 landless and land-poor farmers were allocated 58,000 Russian acres of irrigated land. Today, Turkmenistan has 400 collective farms, 40 state farms, and 73 tractor stations. Water conservancy has also been fundamentally transformed. As a result, the area of irrigated land has been greatly expanded, which has led to the rapid development of agriculture, especially the increase in cotton production. From 1931 to 1941, the cotton planting area increased eightfold. This year, the Republic of Turkmenistan has decided to hand over 400,000 tons of seed cotton to the state. It is already one of the largest cotton producing areas in the Soviet Union. The Karakum Canal, which is currently being excavated, is one of the great communist construction projects of the Soviet Union. It will allow the waters of the Amu Darya River to pass through the desert and realize the Turkmen people's long-cherished dream of "turning the desert into fertile land." The first phase of the canal project (more than 400 kilometers) will be completed next year, which will increase the irrigated area by 100,000 hectares. After the entire project of this great canal is completed, it will fundamentally solve the "water" problem.
    Although Turkmenistan has many deserts, its underground mineral deposits are still very rich. For example, mirabilite, petroleum, and sulfur. During the Soviet era, the republic has achieved industrialization. Petroleum processing, the chemical industry, and light industry have all been established. Now industrial products account for more than 70% of the entire national economy. Compared with 1913, its industrial output has increased seventeenfold, of which heavy industry has increased more than thirtyfold. The republic's power generation has increased 180 times compared to 1913, and its oil production ranks third in the Soviet Union.
    Turkmenistan, which was once a colony of Tsarist Russia before the October Revolution, had only seven literate people out of every thousand. Among the 1.4 million Turkmen people, there was not a single specialist like a doctor or engineer. Women had no opportunity to study at all. Now, 252 out of every thousand people are studying in various schools, that is, one out of every four people is studying. Turkmenistan has not only cultivated a large number of its own ethnic experts, but also many women among them. There are currently about 600 Turkmen women working as factory directors, technicians, and workshop directors, and more than 1,000 women serving as school principals and teachers. This is a great change that the Turkmen people never dreamed of before.
    A small stream flowing down from the Kopet Dag Mountains bordering Iran irrigates an oasis. In 1881, a mountain village was established on this oasis. Ashgabat, the capital of the Republic of Turkmenistan, has developed from this small mountain village. It has now become a huge industrial and cultural center. (Feng) (Attached picture)

    同沙漠战斗的土库曼斯坦
    整个中亚细亚本来就是阳光多，水分少的地方，可是土库曼又是中亚细亚最酷热、最干燥的一个共和国。这儿的阳光非常充足，阴天下雨的日子很少见，蒸发的水量要比降雨量大许多倍。虽然阿姆河在土库曼斯坦的东部流过，但是共和国的绝大部分都离它很远，感到非常缺水。西部有的地方，甚至要用蒸溜器从海水中取得淡水或是经过里海由巴库运来淡水。大自然的阳光并没有给土库曼带来幸福，带来的是占共和国面积90％以上的沙漠和干旱草原。
    但是，十月革命的“阳光”，共产党的“太阳”却给土库曼人民带来了温暖、幸福和自由，带来了水。
    革命前，土库曼仅有的好地和水源都握在大地主手里。苏维埃政权把土地和水都给了农民。1925—1927年实行土地、水源改革后，有二万七千户无地和少地的农户，分到了五万八千俄亩灌溉土地。现在，土库曼有四百个集体农庄，四十个国营农场和七十三个拖拉机站。水利也根本改造了。结果，灌溉土地的面积大大扩大，使农业迅速发展起来，尤其是棉花产量增加了很多。从1931年到1941年，棉花播种面积增加了八倍。今年土库曼共和国就决定交给国家四十万吨籽棉。它已是苏联最大的产棉地之一了。正在开凿的卡拉库姆大运河是苏联伟大的共产主义建设工程之一，它将使阿姆河的水穿过沙漠，实现土库曼人世代想望的“变沙漠为良田”的幻想。运河的第一期工程（四百公里以上）明年就要完成，那时可增加灌溉面积十万公顷。这个大运河全部工程完成后，就可以根本解决“水”的问题了。
    土库曼的沙漠虽然多，但地下埋藏的矿产还是很丰富。例如，芒硝、石油、硫黄等。在苏维埃政权年代里，共和国已实现了工业化。石油加工、化学工业、轻工业都建立起来了。现在工业产品已在全部国民经济中占70％以上。同1913年相比，它的工业产量增加到了十七倍，其中重工业增加到三十倍以上。共和国的发电量已增加为1913年的一百八十倍，石油产量在苏联占第三位。
    十月革命前曾是沙皇俄国的殖民地的土库曼斯坦，一千人中只有七个人识字。一百四十万土库曼人中就没有一个像医生、工程师等这样的专门人材。妇女根本没有读书的机会。现在，每千人中有二百五十二个人在各种学校学习，即四个人中有一个人学习。土库曼不仅培养出大批本民族的专家，而且其中有许多妇女。现有约六百个土库曼妇女做工厂厂长、技师和车间主任，有一千多个妇女担任学校校长和教师。这是从前土库曼人梦想不到的大变化。
    从同伊朗交界的科彼特达格山流下的小溪，灌溉了一片绿洲。1881年在这块绿洲上建立了一个山村。土库曼共和国首都阿什哈巴德，就是从这个小山村发展起来的。它现在已经成为巨大的工业和文化中心了。  （峰）（附图片）
