Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, 5th - The total number of various livestock in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region has greatly exceeded the highest level in history. According to recent materials from the Autonomous Region's Department of Animal Husbandry, the total number of various livestock at the end of this year is estimated to reach more than 21 million head, an increase of more than 5 million head compared with the highest level in Xinjiang's history (15.42 million head in 1942).

The rapid development of various livestock has made the animal husbandry economy play an increasingly important role in Xinjiang's entire national economy. In the past eight years, approximately 1 million quintals of wool alone have been produced; the main livestock products used for export account for more than 60% of the Autonomous Region's total export value. The fine wool produced by the nationally renowned Xinjiang sheep provides high-quality raw materials for China's wool textile industry, and the high-grade wool serge woven from this wool is of very good quality. In the past few years, the Autonomous Region has made great achievements in improving sheep breeds. Now, the region has more than 1 million Xinjiang sheep and improved sheep, which can produce more than 1,200 tons of fine wool and hybrid wool annually. In order to further meet the needs of the national wool textile industry for raw materials and increase the income of farmers and herdsmen, the Autonomous Region also plans to improve 1.45 million sheep this year, an increase of more than 60% over last year.

Due to the increased breeding of Ili horses and Yanqi horses, a large number of livestock are transferred out each year to support agricultural production. In recent years, several thousand Ili draft horses have been provided to Shandong and other places.

In the past eight years, 55 local state-owned ranches and production and construction corps ranches have been newly built in the north and south of the Tianshan Mountains, with a total of 1.18 million head of livestock. These ranches have made remarkable achievements in cultivating and breeding fine breeds. More than 30,000 Xinjiang sheep cultivated by various local state-owned ranches have been promoted to various parts of Xinjiang, as well as Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, Inner Mongolia, and the Northeast region, playing a significant role in improving sheep quality.

    新疆增产牲畜五百万头
    细羊毛为毛纺工业提供了优良原料
    伊犁马焉耆马每年大量供应农业区
    新华社乌鲁木齐5日电　新疆维吾尔自治区各种牲畜的总头数，已大大超过历史上最高水平。自治区畜牧厅根据最近的材料估计，今年年底各种牲畜总头数可达二千一百多万头，比新疆历史上的最高水平（1942年，一千五百四十二万头）增加五百多万头。
    各种牲畜的迅速发展，使畜牧业经济在新疆整个国民经济中日益起着重要作用。八年来仅毛绒一项就生产了一百万公担左右；用来出口的主要畜产品，占到了自治区出口总值的60％以上。著名全国的新疆羊所产的细羊毛，为我国毛纺工业提供了高级原料，用这种毛织成的上等毛哔叽，质量很好。几年来自治区绵羊改良工作取得了很大成就，现在全区拥有新疆羊和改良绵羊一百多万只，每年可产细羊毛和杂种羊毛一千二百多吨。为了进一步满足国家毛纺工业原料的需要和增加农牧民收入，今年自治区还计划改良绵羊一百四十五万只，比去年增加60％以上。
    由于伊犁马和焉耆马的繁殖增加，每年都有大量牲畜外调支援农业生产。几年来支援山东等地的伊犁耕马就有数千匹。
    八年来，在天山南北新建了五十五个地方国营牧场和生产部队牧场，共有牲畜一百一十八万头。这些牧场在培育繁殖优良品种方面有了显著成绩。各地方国营牧场培育出来的新疆羊已经有三万多只推广到新疆各地及陕西、甘肃、青海、内蒙古和东北地区，对提高绵羊质量起了重大作用。
