    Premier Kádár's Speech at the Banquet Given by the Hungarian Ambassador to China
    Dear Comrade Zhu De, dear Comrade Zhou Enlai, dear guests:
    We sincerely thank you, our dear guests, for accepting our invitation to be here with us. We hope you will have a very pleasant evening here.
    Wherever we, the members of the Hungarian government delegation, have gone in China, we have been received with great respect and affection. We are particularly pleased by this, because we clearly understand that this respect and affection is directed toward our homeland, the Hungarian People's Republic, and toward our people, the Hungarian people.
    The talks we have held with our Chinese comrades have clearly demonstrated that the People's Republic of China and the Hungarian People's Republic hold consistent views on all important issues in international relations.
    We are very pleased to have experienced once again that we share the same views on such an important international political issue as the unity of the peoples of all countries building socialism and the further strengthening of this unity. We have a consistent understanding and a common will regarding the need to expose and counter the conspiracies and provocations of imperialists who seek to undermine the national independence of some countries and endanger world peace. We fully agree that we must strive to take all possible steps to ease international tensions and to enable all countries, regardless of their internal systems, and all peoples, regardless of where they live, to coexist peacefully and amicably with each other.
    We are very pleased to have felt that all the Chinese and Hungarian comrades who participated in the negotiations shared the same deep desire: to promote better understanding between each other, to strengthen and expand the existing multifaceted cooperation between us, and to never allow the friendship between the two fraternal peoples—the Chinese people and the Hungarian people—to be undermined, for the benefit of our two peoples and for our common great goal.
    Perhaps I need not say more that the vast Hungarian people, who are engaged in socialist construction, harbor deep respect and fraternal love for the People's Republic of China, a great socialist power that enjoys great and growing prestige throughout the world, and its militant and hardworking people.
    We, the Hungarian people, are not large in number, and they can and have reason to be proud, and indeed are proud, to call the Chinese people, who are not only large in number but also so great and glorious in thought, culture, amazing labor creation, and history of struggle, their true and loyal friends.
    We Hungarians are convinced that the great Chinese people, who have demonstrated such determination and unity in achieving their goals, will surely achieve all their goals. They will surely resolve the Taiwan issue, which undermines the national sovereignty of the Chinese people, and will surely occupy the legitimate position that the People's China deserves in the United Nations.
    Please allow me to take this opportunity to wish the Chinese people victory, peace, and happiness, and to wish the People's Republic of China rapid development in building a socialist society.
    In addition to common interests and goals, the Chinese and Hungarian peoples are linked together by common friends. Among our common friends, we would particularly like to mention the Soviet Union, the first socialist country, the leading country of the socialist countries, which will soon celebrate its 40th anniversary. All peoples who are building socialism, who cherish national independence, and who yearn for and defend peace, pay tribute to the glorious and exemplary forty years of struggle of the Soviet people, who have made enormous sacrifices.
    Not long ago, the imperialists—partly in the diplomatic arena—launched a frantic attack and slander against the Hungarian People's Republic. The Hungarian People's Republic was not isolated in this struggle; its allies and friends, and all those who had good intentions towards it, were with it.
    Please allow me, on behalf of the Hungarian government, to express my gratitude for the goodwill of those diplomatic officials in Beijing who took an understanding attitude towards the position of the Hungarian People's Republic during the frantic attack by the imperialists against us. I am convinced that they have not only done a good deed for the Hungarian people, but that they have also done a good deed with such an attitude for the sacred cause of all honest people—peace and friendship between all countries, peoples, and nations.
    Dear friends, let us drink to the Chinese people, to the friendship between the Chinese and Hungarian peoples, to the friendship between the socialist countries, to the friendship between all peace-loving peoples, and to the health of Comrade Mao Zedong, Comrade Zhu De, Comrade Zhou Enlai, and other Chinese leaders.

    在匈牙利驻华大使的宴会上
    卡达尔总理的讲话亲爱的朱德同志，亲爱的周恩来同志，亲爱的来宾们：
    我们衷心地感谢诸位亲爱的来宾，感谢你们接受我们的邀请来到我们这里。祝你们今晚在我们这里过的很愉快。
    我们匈牙利政府代表团全体团员在中国无论什么地方，处处都受到很大的尊敬和热爱。我们对此特别感到高兴，因为我们清楚地知道，这种尊敬和热爱是通过我们对我们的祖国——匈牙利人民共和国和对我们的人民——匈牙利人民的尊敬和热爱。
    我们同中国同志们所进行的会谈清楚地表明了，中华人民共和国和匈牙利人民共和国在所有国际关系中的重要问题上都有着一致的见解。
    我们很高兴地再一次体会到，对于正在建设社会主义的各国人民的团结和进一步加强这个团结这样一个重要的国际政治问题，我们的见解是一致的。我们对于揭露和反击帝国主义者破坏某些国家人民的民族独立和危害世界和平的阴谋挑衅的必要性方面有着一致的认识和共同的意志。我们完全同意，必须努力采取一切可能采取的步骤来和缓国际紧张局势，并且使所有国家，不论他们的内部制度如何，所有人民，不论他们生活在何处，彼此都能够和平友好地共处。
    我们十分高兴地体会到，所有参加谈判的中国同志和匈牙利同志都同样地有着深切的愿望：为了我们两国人民的利益和共同的伟大目标，促进我们互相间更好的了解，加强和扩大我们之间已有的多方面的合作，并且永远不容许两个兄弟的人民——中国人民和匈牙利人民之间的友谊遭到破坏。
    也许毋须我来多说，正在进行社会主义建设的广大的匈牙利人民对于在全世界享有巨大的、日益增长的威望的社会主义大国——中华人民共和国和它的富有战斗性的、勤劳的人民怀有深切的敬意和兄弟的热爱。
    我们匈牙利人民在数目上并不大，他们能够并且有理由把不仅在数目上很大，而且在思想、文化、惊人的劳动创造以及斗争历史方面都是那样伟大和光荣的中国人民称为他们真正的忠实的朋友，只能感到骄傲，并且也确实感到骄傲。
    我们匈牙利人深信，为实现它的目标而表现得那样坚决和团结一致的伟大的中国人民，一定能够实现他们所有的目标。一定能够解决损害中国人民的国家主权的台湾问题，一定能够在联合国占据人民中国应有的合法位置。
    请允许我利用这个机会祝中国人民胜利、和平和幸福，祝中华人民共和国在建设社会主义社会中迅速地发展。
    把中匈两国人民连结在一起的，除了共同的利益和目标以外，还有共同的朋友。在我们共同的朋友中，我们特别提一下，即将庆祝成立四十周年的、第一个社会主义国家，社会主义各国的领导国家苏联。所有建设社会主义、珍视民族独立、以及渴望和平和保卫和平的人民都对苏联人民付出了巨大牺牲的、光荣的、可以作为榜样的四十年的斗争怀着敬意。
    不久以前，帝国主义者——部分地在外交方面——向匈牙利人民共和国展开了疯狂的进攻和诽谤。匈牙利人民共和国在这个斗争中并不是孤立的，它的同盟者和朋友以及一切对它抱有善意的人们都同它在一起。
    请允许我代表匈牙利政府对那些在帝国主义向我们进行疯狂进攻的时候对匈牙利人民共和国的立场抱着谅解态度的北京的外交官员们的善意表示感谢。我深信，他们不仅替匈牙利人民作了一件好事，而且他们以这样的态度对一切正直人士的神圣事业——所有一切国家、人民和民族之间的和平和友谊——也做了一件好事。
    亲爱的朋友们，让我们为中国人民，为中匈两国人民的友谊，为社会主义各国的友谊，为所有渴望和平的人民的友谊，为毛泽东同志，朱德同志，周恩来同志和其他中国领导人的健康干杯。
