Xinhua News Agency report from Belgrade: According to the Yugoslav News Agency, the Chargé d'Affaires of the West German Embassy in Yugoslavia, Mr. Roschach, visited the Yugoslav Deputy Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Bebler, on the morning of the 19th, and handed him a copy of the West German government's note on severing diplomatic relations with Yugoslavia. The text of this note had already been given by West German Foreign Minister Brentano to the Yugoslav Ambassador to West Germany, Mr. Kveder, in Bonn.

On the same day, the French Ambassador to Yugoslavia, Mr. Broustra, also visited Mr. Bebler and informed him that France had been entrusted with looking after West German interests in Yugoslavia.

The Yugoslav State Secretariat for Foreign Affairs issued a statement on the 19th regarding West Germany's decision to sever diplomatic relations with Yugoslavia. The statement said that such unilateral and arbitrary actions by the government of the Federal Republic of Germany are unprecedented in state relations during peacetime. The government and public opinion of the People's Republic of Yugoslavia are not only deeply dissatisfied with this but also consider it hostile. This policy of the government of the Federal Republic of Germany is neither possible nor in line with the interests of peace, international cooperation, and the principles of the United Nations Charter.

The statement said that the Yugoslav government and people believe that the decision to sever diplomatic relations proves that the Federal Republic of Germany maintains negative and outdated tendencies in international relations and relies on a policy of force and pressure to seek solutions that suit its political concepts.

The statement said that the recognition of the German Democratic Republic by the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia contributes to strengthening peace and international cooperation, while the action of severing relations with Yugoslavia is against the interests of peace, international cooperation, and German reunification.

The statement concluded that despite this hostile action by the Federal Republic of Germany, the Yugoslav government will continue to work to develop friendly relations with the German people.

Bonn dispatch: The Yugoslav Ambassador to the Federal Republic of Germany, Mr. Dušan Kveder, issued a statement at a press conference on the 19th, protesting the West German government's severance of diplomatic relations with Yugoslavia. This statement had been handed to West German Foreign Minister Brentano on the morning of the same day.

The statement said: The Yugoslav government and people condemn this unjustified act by the West German government and express their firm protest against it.

Washington dispatch: The US State Department issued a statement on the 19th, expressing its support for West Germany's severance of diplomatic relations with Yugoslavia.

The State Department statement said that the Adenauer government had "consulted" the United States on this issue, and the United States "expressed understanding" for Adenauer's actions.

    西德断绝同南斯拉夫邦交
    南斯拉夫斥责西德敌意行动
    本报综合报道  据新华社讯：贝尔格莱德消息，据南斯拉夫通讯社报道，西德驻南斯拉夫大使馆代办罗沙赫19日上午访问了南斯拉夫外交国务副秘书长贝勃勒，并且把西德政府关于同南斯拉夫断绝外交关系的照会的副本交给了贝勃勒。这个照会的文本已经由西德外交部长勃伦塔诺在波恩交给了南斯拉夫驻西德大使克维德尔。
    同一天，法国驻南斯拉夫大使布鲁斯塔也访问了贝勃勒，告诉他法国已经受委托照顾西德在南斯拉夫的利益。
    南斯拉夫外交国务秘书处19日就西德决定与南斯拉夫断绝外交关系一事发表声明。声明说，德意志联邦共和国政府的这种片面的和专横的行动，在和平时期的国家关系上是没有惯例的。南斯拉夫人民共和国政府和公众舆论对此不仅感到十分不满，而且认为是敌视的。德意志联邦共和国政府的这种政策不可能、也不符合于和平利益、国际合作和联合国宪章的原则。
    声明说，南斯拉夫政府和人民认为：正是断绝外交关系的决定证明了德意志联邦共和国保持国际关系中的消极的和过时的趋向，并且是依靠武力和压力的政策求得适合它的政治概念的解决办法。
    声明说，南斯拉夫联邦人民共和国承认德意志民主共和国是有助于加强和平和国际合作的，而另一方面，断绝同南斯拉夫的关系的行动是违反和平和国际合作以及德国统一的利益的。
    声明最后说，尽管德意志联邦共和国的这种敌意的行动，南斯拉夫政府将继续为发展和德国人民的友好关系而努力。
    波恩消息：南斯拉夫驻德意志联邦共和国大使杜·克维德尔19日在记者招待会上发表声明，抗议西德政府同南斯拉夫断绝外交关系。这份声明已经在当天上午交给西德外交部长勃伦塔诺。
    声明中说：南斯拉夫政府和人民谴责西德政府这种没有正当理由的行为，并且对此表示坚决的抗议。
    华盛顿消息：美国国务院19日发表声明，表示它支持西德同南斯拉夫断绝外交关系。
    国务院的声明说，阿登纳政府曾经就这个问题“咨询”过美国，美国对阿登纳的行动“表示谅解”。
