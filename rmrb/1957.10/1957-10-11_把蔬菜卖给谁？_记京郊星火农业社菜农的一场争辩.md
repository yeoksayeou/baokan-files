　　To Whom Should We Sell Vegetables?
　　——A Debate Among Vegetable Farmers of the Xinghuo Agricultural Cooperative in the Suburbs of Beijing
    Dian Yi, Si Ru
    To whom should we sell vegetables? – Selling vegetables to the state, implementing the policy of unified purchase and sales, or selling them to private merchants and peddlers, taking the capitalist road? This was one of the main topics of a great debate among the members of the Xinghuo Agricultural Cooperative in the eastern suburbs of Beijing, which mainly produces vegetables.
    In early August, the Fifth Production Team of this cooperative, under the instigation of team leader Liu Hai and other cadres, disregarded the state's unified purchase and sales policy for vegetables and sold vegetables to petty merchants behind the back of the agricultural cooperative's management committee. Some members who were greedy for personal gain were deceived by them and even dreamed of "increasing their income"!
    The speech of middle peasant Wang Wenzheng at one debate reflected the thinking of these people. He said: "The vegetable station has middleman exploitation, and the purchase price is lower than that of small merchants. In my opinion, we should sell the vegetables directly to the consumers. Why let the vegetable station do the reselling!" As soon as Wang Wenzheng finished speaking, seven or eight people immediately rushed to speak to refute him. Liu Changlin, the accountant of the Fifth Team, said: "I don't agree with the statement that 'the vegetable station has middleman exploitation.' The vegetable station is a state-owned enterprise that serves agricultural cooperatives and citizens. How could there be 'middleman exploitation'? Sometimes, when our suburban agricultural cooperatives cannot supply enough vegetables, the vegetable station has to調来調來 large quantities of vegetables from other places, losing a lot of money. Wasn't the Chinese cabbage in the JianGuoMenWai cellar last winter shipped from Shandong? The state buys Chinese cabbage from Shandong and sells it to citizens at a loss. Where have you ever seen such 'middleman exploitation'? I have also seen some vegetables that are loaded and unloaded repeatedly, causing great damage. The vegetable station buys them in at 2.21 cents per catty, but can only sell them for 1.8 cents. Can small merchants do this? You say we should abolish the vegetable station and ask us to sell vegetables in the Hutong. That's pure daydreaming. Think about it, our cooperative puts thousands of catties of vegetables on the market every day, and tens of thousands of catties at most. How much manpower and livestock should the cooperative extract to sell so many vegetables retail? Would we still do the work in the fields? Can the cooperative continue to operate?"
    Wang Wenzheng was questioned and had nothing to say.
    Cui Xusheng and Wang Rui continued: Private merchants and peddlers really rely on speculation and middleman exploitation to get rich. Think about it, if they don't make some money from it, who would do this business? They buy in at 30% and sell at 70%, using the method of low buying and high selling to cheat people. Anyway, the ones who suffer are either the cooperative members or the citizens. Besides, in the past, when we had a lot of vegetables, did small merchants come? If the vegetable station hadn't worked so hard to collect them, I'm afraid no one would have cared if they rotted. But when there is a shortage of vegetables, you will see that small merchants come to grab the quick goods. From this point of view, isn't it very clear who is truly working for our cooperative members?
    Wang Wenzheng's "reason" was already untenable, but he refused to accept it and seized on Liu Changlin's earlier statement that "the damage is great" to ask back: "Why is there so much damage to the vegetables at the vegetable station? Why don't they cherish the vegetables grown by us farmers?" Yang Deyuan stood up and listed facts to answer: "We also have a great responsibility for this problem. For example, in the past, we would wipe the tomatoes and pad the bottom of the baskets with wheat straw before sending them to the market. Now, we don't wipe or pad them. When the car shakes, how can there not be soup? Who do you blame for this?"
    Production team leader Cui Xusheng stood up to reveal: "I said that selling vegetables to small merchants is not a good thing. Wang Wenzheng probably doesn't know how fifth team leader Liu Hai arranged it at the small team leader meeting on the evening of August 1st. That day, Liu Hai, behind the back of branch secretary Lao Cheng, arranged this matter with the small team leaders. He wanted us to tell the members, 'If you want to increase your income and wear long pants, you have to sell vegetables to small merchants, otherwise you won't even be able to wear underpants'; he also said, 'The management committee of the cooperative and the party branch have already agreed to this.' But he also told us, 'No one can tell anyone about this. If the higher authorities find out, you will all be unable to escape. If the higher authorities ask, just say that the members want to do this and let them go to the members.' Think about it, everyone, if this is a good thing, why doesn't the team leader do it in a straightforward manner?"
    A young girl named Yang Xiuzhen continued: "Selling vegetables to small merchants is fulfilling the wishes of those who don't want to engage in cooperation and want to take the capitalist road. Liu Hai only secretly advocated this, and some people in the Fifth Team wanted to keep more private plots, so that they could sell small vegetables themselves in the future, and some people wanted to withdraw from the cooperative after autumn. If this continues, the cooperative that everyone has painstakingly built will not be consolidated. Now everyone should distinguish between right and wrong, unite to protect the cooperative, and defend socialism!" At this time, team leader Liu Hai also stood up to admit that it was wrong to sell vegetables to small merchants, and apologized to the members for this capitalist thinking of not implementing the state's policies and not implementing the contract signed by the agricultural cooperative and the vegetable station.
    This fierce debate was really tit-for-tat. Most of the members who stood on the side of the people, safeguarded the interests of the agricultural cooperative, and adhered to socialism, debated reasonably and with evidence. Those who did not understand who they should sell vegetables to in the past also opened their eyes and saw the benefits of selling vegetables to the state for vegetable farmers, and saw the danger of selling vegetables to small merchants taking the capitalist road. …
    In the end, Wang Wenzheng, who had debated with everyone, also said: "I admit my mistake, I surrender to the truth!"

　　把蔬菜卖给谁？
　　——记京郊星火农业社菜农的一场争辩
    甸义  思茹
    把蔬菜卖给谁？——把蔬菜卖给国家、执行统购包销政策，还是卖给私商小贩走资本主义道路？这是以蔬菜生产为主的北京东郊区星火农业社社员们进行大辩论的主要题目之一。
    8月初，这个社第五生产大队在队长刘海等干部的怂恿下，不执行国家蔬菜的统购包销政策，背着农业社管理委员会，把菜卖给了小商贩。有些贪图个人利益的社员，受到他们的蒙蔽，还真的梦想“增加收入”呢！
    中农王文正在一次辩论会上的发言，反映出这般人的思想。他说：“菜站有中间剥削，收购价钱比小商贩低。依我的意见，咱们把菜直接卖给吃主，何必叫菜站倒把呢！”王文正刚说完，马上就有七八个人争先发言驳斥他。第五大队会计刘长林说：“说‘菜站有中间剥削’，我不同意。菜站是国营企业，是为农业社和市民服务的，怎么可能有‘中间剥削’？有时候，咱们郊区农业社的菜供应不上，菜站还要从外地调来大批菜，赔很多钱。去年冬天建国门外菜窖里的大白菜，不就是从山东运来的？国家从山东买来白菜赔钱卖给市民，你在哪儿见过这样的‘中间剥削’？我还见过有些菜，装车、卸车反复折腾，损耗很大，菜站二分二厘一斤买进来的，只能卖一分八厘，这样的事儿小商贩办得到吗？你说把菜站取消，叫我们到胡同去卖菜，这纯是做梦。你想咱们社每天上市的菜，少说也有上千斤，多了就是几万斤，这么多菜零售起来社里该抽多少人力和牲口？那样地里活儿还干不干了？社还能不能办下去？”
    王文正被质问得无话答对。
    崔续生和王瑞接下去说：私商小贩才真靠投机倒把和中间剥削来发财呢。你想他们要不从中赚点谁还干这行买卖。他们三分进货就七分出，用低买高卖手法来坑人，反正吃亏的不是社员就是市民。再说过去我们菜多的时候，小商贩来过没有？如果不是菜站拚命收，恐怕就是放烂了也没人管你的。可是等菜缺了你再瞧吧，小商贩就都来抢快货。从这件事上看，谁是真心为咱社员不是很清楚吗？
    王文正的“理由”已经站不住脚，又不肯服气，抓住刘长林方才说的“损耗很大”反问道：“菜站的菜为什么有那么大损耗？我们农民种的菜，他们为什么不爱护？”杨德元站起来，列举事实，回答说：“这个问题，咱们也有很大责任。比如从前吧，都是把西红柿擦了又擦，筐底儿垫上麦秸，然后才送到市场上去卖。现在可好，不擦不垫，在车上一摇晃，还有个不流汤的？你说这事怨谁？”
    生产小队长崔续生起来揭露说：“我说把菜卖给小商贩不是什么好事情。王文正大概不知道五大队长刘海在8月1日晚上小队长会上怎样布置的，那天刘海背着支部书记老程，向小队长们布置了这件事。他要我们告诉社员‘要想增加收入，都能穿上长裤子，就得把菜卖给小商贩，不然连裤衩全穿不上’；还说‘这样做社管理委员会和党总支已经同意了’。可是他又叫我们‘这件事谁也不能讲出去，上级知道了你们都跑不掉。如果上级查问，就说社员要这么做，叫他们找社员去。’大家想想，如果这是好事情，大队长为什么不正大光明地做？”
    一个叫杨秀珍的年轻姑娘接下去说：“把菜卖给小商贩是遂了那些不想搞合作化、想走资本主义路的人的意。刘海只背地里这么一提倡，五大队就有人想多留点自留地，将来好自己卖小菜，还有人想等到秋后退社，这样下去大家兢兢业业办起来的社就不能巩固。现在大家应该分清是非，团结起来保护合作社，保卫社会主义！”这时候，大队长刘海也站起来承认把菜卖给小商贩是错误的，并且向社员们检讨这种不执行国家政策、不执行农业社同菜站订立的合同的资本主义思想。
    这一场激烈争辩真是针锋相对。大多数站在人民立场、维护农业社利益和社会主义的社员，辩得有理有据。过去弄不清应该把蔬菜卖给谁的人，也都擦亮了眼睛，看到把蔬菜卖给国家对菜农的好处，看到把蔬菜卖给小商贩是走资本主义道路的危险。……
    最后，同大家争辩的王文正也说：“我认错，我向真理投降！”
