　　Preoccupied under the Soviet Moon, Discordant Bedfellows on the Middle East Issue:
    British Prime Minister to Meet with US President
    (Our Correspondent in London, October 18th) British officials announced last night that Macmillan will visit the United States next Tuesday to hold talks with Eisenhower.
    This news caused surprise in London, as only a week ago, British officials had denied the possibility of a meeting between the two leaders in the near future.
    This meeting was initiated by Britain. Contrary to the attitude at the Bermuda talks, the United States did not delay and immediately accepted the British proposal.
    A statement from 10 Downing Street said that Macmillan "expects this meeting to be one of a series of talks we are holding with our American friends and other friendly governments." British newspapers reported that a series of meetings between Western leaders will be held within a few months.
    The main topic of the Anglo-American talks will be the Middle East issue. "The Times" editorial stated that Britain and the United States need to "find a long-term plan" in the Middle East. "News Chronicle" said that in the Macmillan-Eisenhower talks, the United States will seek British support for Washington's Middle East policy.
    It is believed that both Britain and the United States hope to "coordinate" their policies in the Middle East through the talks. However, not long ago, Britain rejected the Soviet proposal to convene a major power conference to discuss the Middle East situation. It is clear that the Anglo-American talks will not lead to the stability of the Middle East situation.
    The success of the Soviet Union in testing intercontinental missiles and launching artificial satellites has greatly shocked Britain and ultimately shattered the United States' attempt to monopolize this field. Therefore, the talks will also discuss the issue of exchanging nuclear information between the two countries.
    According to newspapers here, in addition to the above issues, the talks will also involve many other issues. But interestingly, "The Times" specifically emphasized that Eisenhower and Macmillan will definitely not discuss the pound issue.

### 在苏联月亮下心事重重  在中东问题上同床异梦  英首相将同美总统会谈

　　在苏联月亮下心事重重  在中东问题上同床异梦
    英首相将同美总统会谈
    本报伦敦18日电  英官方昨晚宣布：麦克米伦将于下星期二访问美国，与艾森豪威尔举行会谈。
    这个消息在伦敦引起惊奇，因为一周以前，英官方曾否认两国首脑在最近举行会议的可能性。
    这次会谈是英国主动要求的。与百慕大会谈时的态度相反，美国没有拖延，立即接受了英国的建议。
    唐宁街十号的公报说：麦克米伦“预期这次会谈将成为我们与我们的美国朋友以及其他友好政府所举行的会谈之一。”英国报纸报道，在几个月内，西方国家的首脑将举行一系列的会谈。
    此次英美会谈的主要内容，将是中东问题。“泰晤士报”社论说，英美需要在中东“寻找一个长期的计划”。“新闻纪事报”则说：在麦克米伦和艾森豪威尔会谈中，美国将寻求英国对华盛顿的中东政策的支持。
    人们相信，英美双方都希望通过会谈“协调”它们在中东的政策。但是，不久以前，英国拒绝了苏联关于召开大国会议讨论中东局势的建议。由此可见，英美会谈绝不会导致中东局势的稳定。
    苏联试验洲际导弹与放射人造卫星的成功，给英国带来了很大的震动，并使美国在这一方面实行垄断的企图最终地幻灭。因此，此次会谈还将讨论两国交换原子核情报问题。
    据此间报纸透露，除了上述问题以外，会谈还将涉及其他很多问题。但有趣的是：“泰晤士报”特别强调艾森豪威尔和麦克米伦将绝不会讨论英镑问题。
