    Making Brick Tea for the Egyptian People
    Workers at the Zhao Liqiao Brick Tea Factory of the Hubei Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative are processing 80 tons of rice brick tea made from black tea raw materials for the Egyptian people. The first batch of 40 tons of rice brick tea has already been shipped.
    In order to let the Egyptian people taste the special flavor of Chinese rice brick tea, the workers in this factory carefully blended "broken black tea" from Hunan, "Dian Hong" from Yunnan, and "Min Hong" from Fujian as raw materials during processing. (Ruan Shiqing)

    为埃及人民制砖茶
    湖北省供销合作社赵李桥砖茶厂工人，正在为埃及人民加工八十吨用红茶原料制成的米砖茶。第一批生产的四十吨米砖茶，已经启运。
    为了让埃及人民尝到中国米砖茶的特种味道，这个厂的工人们在加工的时候，认真地把湖南的“碎红茶”和云南的“滇红”、福建的“闽红”拼配成原料。　　（阮仕清）
