　　Standing Firm in the Anti-Rightist Struggle
    A Group of Senior Intellectuals in Shaanxi Join the Party
    Nine Engineers from the Second Ministry of Machine Building Gloriously Join the Party
    Xinhua News Agency Dispatch  Recently, the Communist Party organizations at the provincial and municipal levels in Shaanxi accepted twenty-eight senior intellectuals into the Chinese Communist Party. Among them are university professors, lecturers, engineers in the engineering and technical field, and attending physicians in hospitals.
    This group of senior intellectuals have been diligently working for a long time and have made great achievements. Especially in the current struggle against the bourgeois rightists, they stood firm, resolutely fought against the rightists, and their political consciousness has been significantly improved. Jin Zhongyuan, a lecturer in the Hydraulic Engineering Department of Jiaotong University, has always been active in his work. When the rightists launched a frantic attack on the Party, despite suffering from illness, he insisted on working while actively participating in the anti-rightist struggle. Lü Guangzu, a mechanical and electrical engineer in the Northwest Textile Administration Bureau, was able to closely connect with workers and diligently study his profession in the past, and was rated as an A-level labor model. In the anti-rightist struggle, he used his personal experience to reason with the rightists and refuted their malicious slanders.
    This newspaper reports that in the anti-Rightist struggle, Wang Daozhou, Sun Zhenxian, Wang Jixun, Ma Aichu, Li Xianzhong, Tong Zhipeng, Chen Hao, Wang Boying, and Li Danming, nine engineers of the Second Ministry of Machine Building, gloriously joined the Chinese Communist Party.
    In ordinary times, they not only actively studied their professions and exerted their creativity, but also studied political theory more seriously and worked hard to transform themselves. In their work, they have always closely relied on the Party organization, paid attention to contacting the masses around them, and made remarkable achievements in their business leadership or technical guidance positions. Some have been selected as model members of the Communist Youth League, and some have been repeatedly selected as advanced producers. They all submitted applications to join the Party a long time ago and have been actively working hard to reach the level of a Party member.
    In this great storm of the bourgeois rightists' rampant attack on the Party, they all resolutely fought against the rightists to safeguard the interests of the Party. For example, Comrade Sun Zhenxian, a first-class engineer who was admitted to the Party, is the deputy director of the capital construction department of the ministry. When the rightists in the ministry launched a vicious attack on the Party, he stood firm on the position of the working class, wrote articles, presented facts, and reasoned, and actively participated in the anti-rightist struggle.
    The comrades who were approved to join the Party all firmly stated that they must better strengthen their ideological transformation and strive to the end for the Party's ultimate goal—the cause of communism.

　　在反右派斗争中站稳立场
    陕西一批高级知识分子入党
    第二机械部九名工程师光荣入党
    新华社讯  陕西省和西安市级共产党组织最近接受了二十八名高级知识分子加入中国共产党。其中有大学教授、讲师，工程技术界的工程师和医院里的主治医师。
    这批高级知识分子，长期埋头辛勤工作，并且作出很大成绩。特别是在这次反对资产阶级右派的斗争中，站稳立场，坚决和右派分子作斗争，政治觉悟有了显著提高。交通大学水利系讲师金仲元过去工作一贯积极，当右派分子向党猖狂进攻时，他身体虽然患病，仍一面坚持工作，一面积极参加反右派斗争。西北纺织管理局机电工程师吕光祖过去在工作中能密切联系工人，认真钻研业务，被评为甲等劳动模范。在反右派斗争中，他以亲身体验同右派分子展开说理斗争，驳倒右派分子的恶意污蔑。
    本报讯  在反右派斗争中，第二机械工业部工程师王道周、孙振先、王继勋、马艾初、李宪忠、童志鹏、陈浩、王伯英、李旦明等九名工程师光荣加入了中国共产党。
    他们在平时，不仅积极地钻研业务，发挥创造精神，并且更认真地学习政治理论，努力改造自己。在工作中，他们一直紧密地靠拢党的组织，注意联系周围群众，在业务领导或技术指导岗位上作出了显著的成绩。有的被评选为模范团员，有的被多次评选为先进生产者。他们都在很早以前提出了入党申请，并且为达到党员水平而积极努力。
    在这次资产阶级右派分子猖狂向党进攻的大风大浪中都坚决为维护党的利益而与右派分子展开斗争。如被吸收入党的一级工程师孙振先同志是该部基建部门的副处长。当该部右派分子向党进行恶毒进攻时，他站稳了工人阶级的立场，写文章，摆事实，讲道理，积极地参加了反右派斗争。
    被批准入党的同志们都坚决地表示：一定要更好地加强思想改造，为党的最终目的——共产主义事业奋斗到底。
