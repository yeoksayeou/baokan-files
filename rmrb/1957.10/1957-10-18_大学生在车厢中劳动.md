College Students Labor in Train Cars

Not long ago, more than three hundred students and teachers from the East China Textile Engineering Institute participated in voluntary labor on trains in batches. These trains departed from Shanghai and went to destinations including Beijing, Tianjin, Xi'an, Nanjing, Nanping, Wuxi, Changzhou, Hangzhou, and Wusong. They served more than 400,000 passengers.

The duty of train attendants is to serve passengers, making their lives on the train comfortable and pleasant, and making them feel like they are at home. These young men and women were in charge of emptying spittoons, cleaning toilets, sweeping the floor, mopping, providing hot water, helping passengers with their luggage, and finding seats. These tasks were not simple. Take the task of making tea, for example. A train attendant could hold a cup in their left hand, open the lid with two fingers, and pour water from the kettle into the cup with their right hand without spilling a drop. However, these volunteer train attendants dared not attempt this superb skill of pouring water. When they poured water, they would spread their feet apart, stand firmly, take the teacup with their left hand, put down the kettle with their right hand, open the teacup lid and place it on the table, and then lift the kettle to pour water. Even so, they would accidentally spill water on their hands or on the passengers. When the train was about to arrive at a station, the train attendant would loudly announce the station name, asking passengers getting off the train to check their luggage and prepare to disembark. These volunteer train attendants were somewhat shy when doing this, and some could not bring themselves to call out; some braced themselves to shout out the name of the train stop, but dared not look at the passengers, and even felt like their tongues were tied. Once, when the train arrived at Laizhou Station to add water, the young men and women dragged a long rubber hose and connected it to the water faucet, thinking everything was fine. Unexpectedly, the joint failed, and when the water tank was full and the faucet was about to be turned off and the hose removed, the water still shot out fiercely. It was not until the train conductor jumped next to the faucet and pressed down on the outlet that the water was brought under control.

Labor in the train cars provided the students with a vivid and rich political lesson. After this labor, the students deeply experienced the hardship and glory of labor. They deeply realized that to be a people's train attendant, one must not only work hard and diligently, but also possess the noble communist quality of loving others as oneself.

### 大学生在车厢中劳动

　　大学生在车厢中劳动
    华东纺织工学院在不久前，有三百多个学生和教师分批参加了列车上的义务劳动。这些列车是从上海开往北京、天津、西安、南京、南平、无锡、常州、杭州和吴淞等地去的。他们曾为四十多万旅客服务过。
    列车员的义务就是为旅客服务，使得旅客在车上的生活舒适愉快，觉得就像在自己家里一样。这些小伙子和姑娘们，在车厢中倒痰盂，洗厕所，扫地，拖地板，冲开水，帮助旅客拿东西，找座位。这些劳动都是不简单的。就拿冲茶水这项工作来说吧。列车员左手拿杯子，两个指头一夹盖子就开，右手壶里的水一点不洒地倒进杯子。可是，这些义务列车员就不敢尝试这种冲水的绝技。他们冲水时，都是两脚摆开，站稳姿势，左手接过茶杯，右手放下水壶，把茶杯盖子掀开放在桌上，再提壶冲水。就这样，一不小心，不是把水冲在自己的手上，就是冲在旅客的身上。火车快到站了，列车员要大声报站名，请下车的旅客检点自己的行李准备下车。这些义务列车员做起这件事情来有些怕羞，有的人喊不出口；有的人硬着头皮喊了列车停靠站名的时候，眼睛却不敢看旅客，甚至舌头像打了结。一次列车到了莱州站加水，姑娘和小伙子们拖了长大的橡皮管接在水龙头上，满以为没有事了，不料接头的地方失灵，当水箱水满要把水龙头关上拿下皮管的时候，水却仍然凶猛地射出来。直到车长跳到龙头旁边，按住出口的地方，才把水制住。
    车厢中的劳动给学生们上了一堂生动丰富的政治课。学生们经过这次劳动以后，切身体会到劳动的艰苦和光荣。他们深深地体会到，要做一个人民的列车员，不仅要埋头苦干，勤勤恳恳，而且要有爱人如己的高尚的共产主义品质。
