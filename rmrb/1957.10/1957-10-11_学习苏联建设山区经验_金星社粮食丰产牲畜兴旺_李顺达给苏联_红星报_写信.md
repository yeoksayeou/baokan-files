Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, October 10th: National Agricultural Labor Model Li Shunda recently wrote a letter to the editorial department of the Soviet "Red Star" newspaper, introducing the Jin Xing Agricultural, Forestry, and Livestock Production Cooperative's experience in learning from the Soviet Union in the construction of mountain areas, and expressing gratitude to the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the government, and the Soviet people.

Li Shunda said in his letter that the Soviet Union is a loyal friend of the Chinese people. Over the years, the assistance they have repeatedly given us in agricultural construction is something we will never forget. In the autumn of 1952, he visited the Soviet Union and studied the construction experience of farmers in the mountainous areas of Siberia, which made him even more clear about the direction of mountain area construction and development. Over the past five years, the Jin Xing Cooperative has achieved many accomplishments in mountain area construction by following this direction in combination with the specific local conditions. Now, the cooperative has completed more than 360 water and soil conservation projects, controlling soil erosion in an area accounting for more than 60% of the total area, and expanding irrigated land by more than 750 mu. The land with improved soil accounts for 80% of the total area, and all mountain land has been banked, basically playing a role in conserving soil, water, and fertilizer. Coupled with agricultural technology reforms such as changing low-yield to high-yield, single cropping to intercropping, inferior varieties to superior varieties, sparse planting to dense planting, and single cropping to double cropping, the cooperative's output has gradually increased. Last year, although the Jin Xing Cooperative encountered extraordinarily serious disasters such as hail, wind, and floods, thanks to the care and support of the local Party and government organs and the efforts of all cooperative members, the average yield of the cooperative's more than 1,030 mu of crops still reached 400 jin per mu. Over the past few years, the cooperative has basically afforested more than 6,200 mu of mountain land, and some timber trees and apple trees have already blossomed and borne fruit. In terms of animal husbandry, 20% of the cooperative's nearly 1,000 sheep are of excellent breeds, and the cooperative has also bred Soviet Large White horses and Ukrainian Large White pigs.

Li Shunda said that with the development of production, the lives of the cooperative members have also improved. Now, the average annual income of each cooperative member is more than double what it was before the Anti-Japanese War, and 79% higher than before the establishment of the cooperative.

The letter continued, the Jin Xing Cooperative members personally experienced that all these changes in production and life are the result of the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, and are inseparable from the selfless assistance from all aspects of the Soviet Union. The Jin Xing Cooperative has recently formulated a ten-year development plan for the future. In order to realize this plan, the cooperative members are further learning from the experience of Soviet mountain farmers in building socialism.

Li Shunda said in his letter that he and the cooperative members are using practical actions to welcome the 40th anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution, and are actively doing a good job in the late-stage management of autumn fields, striving for a bumper agricultural harvest this year, as a gift to the holiday.

　　学习苏联建设山区经验  金星社粮食丰产牲畜兴旺
    李顺达给苏联“红星报”写信
    新华社太原10日电　全国农业劳动模范李顺达最近给苏联“红星报”编辑部写了一封信，介绍金星农林牧生产合作社学习苏联建设山区经验的情况，并向苏联共产党、政府和苏联人民致谢。
    李顺达在信中说，苏联是中国人民忠实的朋友。几年来，在农业建设方面一再给予我们的帮助是我们永远不能忘记的。1952年秋天他去苏联参观，学习了西伯利亚山区农民建设经验，使他更加明确了山区建设的发展的方向。五年来，金星社按照这个方向结合当地的具体情况，在建设山区方面取得了许多成就。现在，全社共完成水土保持工程三百六十多处，控制水土流失面积占总面积60％以上，并且扩大水浇地七百五十多亩。全社改良了土壤的土地已经占到80％，所有山地都培起地埂，基本上起了保土保水保肥的作用。加上低产变高产、单作变间作、劣种变优种、稀植变密植和一作变两作等农业技术改革，全社产量逐步提高。去年金星社虽然遇到雹、风、洪水等特大灾害，但是由于当地党政机关的关心和支援以及全体社员的努力，全社一千零三十多亩庄稼每亩平均产量仍然达到四百斤。几年来，全社基本上绿化了六千二百多亩山地，部分木材树和苹果树已经开花结果。畜牧方面，全社近千只羊中有20％是优良畜种，社里还繁殖了苏联大白马的马种和乌克兰大白猪。
    李顺达说，随着生产的发展，社员生活也改善了。现在，每个社员的每年平均收入已经比抗日战争前提高一倍多，比办社前提高79％。
    信上接着说，金星社社员们亲身体会到所有生产和生活上的这些变化，是中国共产党的正确领导的结果，是和苏联各方面的无私援助分不开的。金星社最近又订出了今后十年发展规划。为了实现这个规划，社员们正在进一步学习苏联山区农民建设社会主义的经验。
    李顺达在信中说，他和社员们正以实际行动迎接十月社会主义革命四十周年，正积极作好秋田后期管理工作，力争今年农业大丰收，作为向节日的献礼。
