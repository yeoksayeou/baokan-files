A statement from the Saudi Arabian government, released through the Saudi Arabian embassy in Cairo, said: "The BBC said in a commentary that Saudi Arabia had accepted the Eisenhower Doctrine. In fact, this is completely untrue. The Saudi Arabian government has not accepted financial assistance from any country. The Saudi Arabian government does not believe that this attitude will affect its friendly relations with the United States."

The Saudi Arabian government said in the statement that it "believes that all Arabs hope to maintain friendly and close relations with the West based on respect for the right of Arab peoples to territorial integrity and non-violation of their independence."

Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, 8th - Syrian officials announced on October 7th that Syrian President Kuwatly recently sent a telegram to Saudi Arabian King Saud, expressing his gratitude for Saudi Arabia's support for Syria in the United Nations.

His telegram said, "The speech of your representative in the United Nations once again proves that His Majesty believes that the cause of the Arab people is just."

Saud said in a return telegram: "What our representative did in the United Nations is only part of our policy that you and everyone else know. We will continue to pursue our policy until all Arabs achieve victory."
