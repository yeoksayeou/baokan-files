    Medal of Honor
    In August 1956, Stepanova, a Soviet female geological engineer who was assisting China in exploration work in the Altai Mountains of Xinjiang, became seriously ill and had to be sent to the airport more than 100 kilometers away from the mountainous area so that she could be flown to Urumqi for treatment. Nie Yinchu (a Communist Party member), a Chinese geological worker, and several other Chinese and Soviet geological personnel were assigned to this escort mission. When they arrived at the Erqi Si River late at night, they found that all the ferries were docked on the opposite bank. Regardless of the dangerous currents, Nie Yinchu climbed onto the steel cable used for ferrying across the river, risking his life, and using all his strength, crossed the river to bring the boat over, and finally delivered Stepanova to the airport safely and in time. The patient recovered after treatment. Nie Yinchu's heroic deeds were widely published in Soviet newspapers. On September 18, the Soviet Consul General in Urumqi, Kazansky, on behalf of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, awarded Nie Yinchu a "Medal of Honor" to commend his high degree of internationalism and heroic behavior.

    荣誉勋章
    1956年8月，在新疆阿尔泰山区帮助我国进行勘探工作的苏联女地质工程师斯捷潘诺娃患了重病，必须要送她到离山区一百多公里的机场，让她乘飞机到乌鲁木齐去治疗。我国地质工作人员聂银初（共产党员）和其他的几位中苏地质人员担负了这个护送任务。当深夜到达额尔齐斯河畔时，发现渡河的船都停泊在对岸。聂银初不顾水势险恶，攀上河身摆渡用的钢丝绳，冒着生命危险，用尽平生力气，过河将船开过来，终于把斯捷潘诺娃及时地安全地送到机场。病人经过治疗恢复健康。聂银初的英雄事迹曾经在苏联各报纸上广泛刊载。9月18日，苏联驻乌鲁木齐总领事卡赞斯基代表苏联最高苏维埃主席团把一枚“荣誉勋章”授给聂银初，嘉奖他的高度的国际主义精神和英雄行为。（附图片）
