Protect Artesian Wells, Develop Farmland Irrigation
Ge Yin Xuan

Artesian wells are the most economical and convenient type of well for developing farmland irrigation and supplying drinking water for people and livestock. Without the need for water lifting equipment, the water in the well can automatically flow to the surface. This is because there is a geological structure suitable for drilling artesian wells underground: two impermeable layers sandwiching a pressurized aquifer. If the water source recharge area is higher than the ground where the well is drilled, the water will gush to the surface after the upper impermeable layer is penetrated.

Many places in China have already drilled artesian wells, and they have been successfully used to irrigate large areas of farmland. For example, in the northern and western suburbs of the capital, Baoding and Pinggu counties in Hebei Province, Zhangdian and Huantai in Shandong Province, Jiexiu and Pingyao in Shanxi Province, the Leizhou Peninsula in Guangdong Province, and near Urumqi in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, there are such wells. In the future, with the progress of hydrogeological surveys and the large-scale development of underground water sources during construction, more new artesian well areas will definitely be discovered.

In order to fully utilize artesian wells to develop farmland irrigation, I propose three suggestions:

One, in places where there are no artesian wells, if new artesian wells are drilled during farmland water conservancy construction and industrial basic construction, the general situation should be reported to the local water conservancy authorities or geological teams stationed locally, just like "reporting a mineral discovery," in order to further study these valuable data.

Two, in areas where artesian wells can be drilled, they should be excavated in a planned manner. The well density should not be too high to prevent the water head from becoming low and the water volume from decreasing. At the same time, it is recommended to install control switches, turning them on to release water when needed and turning them off when not in use, so that water is not wasted. The method is very simple: lengthen the pipe at the water outlet to reach the static, non-spraying water level, and connect a horizontal pipe with a switch next to the vertical pipe. In the Soviet Union, the method of adding switches to artesian wells has been practiced for many years. For example, the Azerbaijan Republic has 1,600 artesian wells, which are generally closed for four months in winter, maintaining the original water head and volume, and ensuring the original irrigated area. This method is also being trialed on the Leizhou Peninsula in China, and it is recommended that other places gradually follow suit.

Three, many drilling units often drill holes with artesian groundwater when drilling through strata. It is recommended that these boreholes be retained for farmland irrigation. The Ministry of Geology has already left more than ten artesian boreholes in Guangdong for local use, and the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry has also left seven artesian boreholes for agricultural cooperatives in Huantai County, Shandong Province, which are very popular with the local agricultural cooperatives. These artesian wells have also played a role in increasing production. However, some units, after drilling artesian boreholes, fill them in after testing, or lengthen the pipes and only observe the water level without releasing water for use. There are three artesian wells east of Cui Junzhuang in Zhangdian, Shandong Province, all of which can spray one or two meters above the ground, but they are left unused instead of being used to irrigate the land. Therefore, if drilling units drill artesian boreholes, they should actively contact the local authorities and hand them over for farmland irrigation, so that agricultural cooperatives can drill fewer wells and increase production more. Finally, I hope that the relevant central construction authorities will consider uniformly notifying all drilling units of the petroleum, coal, metallurgy, geology, and other departments of this method.

    爱护自流井，发展农田灌溉事业
    葛荫萱
    自流井是发展农田灌溉、供给人、畜饮水方面最经济和最方便的一种水井。不用提水设备，井里的水可以自动地涌到地面上来，这是因为在地下有一种适合打出自流井的地质构造，就是上下两层不透水的地层中间夹着一层有压力的含水层，如果水源补给区比打井地方的地面为高，当把上边的不透水地层打穿以后，水就要冒出地面上来。
    我国很多地方已经打出了自流井，它们已被顺利地利用来灌溉很大面积的农田。例如，首都的北郊、西郊，河北省的保定、平谷等县，山东省的张店、桓台，山西省的介休、平遥，广东省的雷州半岛以及新疆维吾尔自治区的乌鲁木齐附近等地，都有了这种水井。今后随着水文地质调查工作的进展和建设当中地下水源的大量开发，一定会发现更多的新自流井区。
    为了充分利用自流井发展农田灌溉，我提出三点建议：
    一、在没有自流井的地方，在农田水利建设和工业基本建设当中，如果打出新的自流井，应当像“报矿”一样，把概况报告给当地的水利机关或驻在当地的地质队，以便进一步研究这些宝贵的资料。
    二、在能打自流井的地区还要有计划地开掘，井眼不要过密，防止水头变低，水量减少。同时建议安装控制开关，用水时拧开放水，不用水时关上，不叫水流白白流掉。做法很简单，就是在喷水的管口上接长管子，以达到静止不喷的水位，在立管旁面接一根横管，装置开关。在苏联，自流井上加开关的方法，早已实行多年。例如阿塞拜疆共和国有一千六百个自流井，冬季普遍关闭四个月，始终保持原有的水头和水量，也保证了原有的灌溉面积。这个办法，我国雷州半岛也在开始试行，建议别的地方逐步仿效。
    三、各处许多钻探单位，在钻探地层时常常打出来自流地下水的钻孔，建议把这些钻孔保留下来，供农田灌溉方面使用。地质部已经在广东给当地留下十多眼自流钻孔，冶金工业部也在山东桓台县给农业社留下了七眼自流钻孔，很受当地农业社欢迎，这些自流井对增产也起了作用。可是也有些单位虽然打出自流钻孔，在试验以后又填掉了，或者接长了管子，只做水位的观测，而没有放水用起来。山东张店崔军庄东边就有三个自流井，都可以喷出地面一、两公尺，可是都被放置着，没有利用它们去浇地。因此钻探单位如果打出自流钻孔，应当主动联系交给地方，供农田灌溉使用，这样可以使农业社少打井多增产。最后我希望中央有关建设机关最好考虑把这个办法统一通知石油、煤炭、冶金、地质等部门的各个钻探单位。
