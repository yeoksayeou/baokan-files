Before the award ceremony, Tsende, Vice Chairman of the Central Council of Trade Unions, read out the Central Council's decision to award medals to the Chinese workers. Tsende also congratulated the Chinese workers on their greater achievements in production.

These forty-six Chinese workers were rewarded because some of them had overfulfilled their production plans; some had produced high-quality products with no rejects; and some had put forward rationalization proposals to reduce production costs.
