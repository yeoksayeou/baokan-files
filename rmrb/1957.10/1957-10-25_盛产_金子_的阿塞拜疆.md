Azerbaijan, A Land of "Gold"

When Azerbaijan is mentioned, the first thing that comes to mind is its capital, Baku, known as the city of oil, and the beautiful and magnificent oil derricks standing on the Caspian Sea. Azerbaijan, known as the Republic of Oil, has long been famous throughout the world. However, it is now incomplete to call it that, because in addition to being rich in "black gold" - oil, and establishing industrial sectors such as machine manufacturing, chemical industry, and metallurgy, it is also rich in "white gold" - cotton. Cotton production ranks second in the Soviet Union.

Before the October Revolution, although Baku was a world-famous oil extraction center, the oil industry was almost entirely in the hands of foreign capitalists. The technical level of oil extraction was very low, and the workers bore heavy manual labor. The oil fields and workers' residences were dirty and unbearable. Baku even had the nickname "Black City." The people of Azerbaijan lived a life of poverty and ignorance.

Six days after the Peterburg Uprising in 1917, the people of Azerbaijan followed their Russian brothers and were the first in the East to raise the banner of the Great October Revolution, declaring the establishment of Soviet power in Baku.

During the Soviet era, the oil industry was completely transformed and equipped with the latest technology in the world. Azerbaijan's oil production per capita has far exceeded that of the United States. Last year, its output was 15.6 million tons, an average of 4.6 tons per person. The average oil production in the United States last year was only a little over two tons per person. Azerbaijan's total industrial output has increased elevenfold compared to 1913. The oil extraction and refining equipment produced in Azerbaijan is supplied not only to the Soviet Union, but also exported to fourteen countries. In 1955, the Mingechaur large hydropower station was also completed, which supplies electricity not only to Azerbaijan, but also to Georgia and the Transcaucasian railways. This is the power base of Soviet Transcaucasia and the pride of the Azerbaijani people. Azerbaijan's power generation is now four times that of Turkey, although its population is only one-seventh of Turkey's.

The irrigated fertile land on both sides of the Kura River has also expanded considerably with the development of water conservancy work. In 1913, Azerbaijan's cotton production was only 64,000 tons, but in 1956 it was 352,000 tons, and this year it will reach 400,000 tons. Silk, tea, and fruits are also famous products in this area.

Before the revolution, 90% of the more than three million people in Azerbaijan were illiterate. Now the republic has more than 3,600 primary and secondary schools, 15 universities, and 80 scientific research institutions. The capital, Baku, has become a prosperous and beautiful metropolis. More than three-quarters of the republic's industry is concentrated in Baku. (Jun) (Attached picture)

### 盛产“金子”的阿塞拜疆

    盛产“金子”的阿塞拜疆
    提起阿塞拜疆，首先就会想到它那具有油都之称的首都巴库，想到里海海面上耸立着的美丽而雄壮的油井架。阿塞拜疆有石油共和国之称，早已闻名世界。不过，现在这样称呼它已经是很不完全了。因为它除去盛产“黑金”——石油、建立了机器制造、化学、冶金等工业部门外，还盛产“白金”——棉花。棉花产量占苏联第二位。
    十月革命以前，巴库虽是世界著名的石油开采中心，但是那时石油工业差不多都握在外国资本家的手里，采油的技术水平十分低劣，工人们担负着沉重的手工劳动。采油场和工人住所都是肮脏不堪。巴库甚至有了个“黑城”的绰号。阿塞拜疆人民过着贫困愚昧的生活。
    在1917年彼得堡起义后的第六天，阿塞拜疆人就跟着俄罗斯的兄弟们首先在东方打起了伟大十月革命的旗帜，在巴库宣布建立苏维埃政权。
    在苏维埃政权年代，石油工业被彻底改造了，完全用世界上最新的技术装备了起来。阿塞拜疆石油产量按人口平均计算已经远远超过美国。去年，它的产量是一千五百六十万吨，每人平均四点六吨。美国去年石油产量平均每人只有二吨多一点。阿塞拜疆的工业产品总量，已比1913年增加了十一倍。阿塞拜疆生产的采油和炼油设备除供给苏联外，还输往十四个国家。1955年又建成了明格查乌尔大水电站，它除阿塞拜疆外，还供给格鲁吉亚和外高加索的铁路用电。这是苏维埃外高加索的动力基地，也是阿塞拜疆人民的骄傲。阿塞拜疆的发电量现在是土耳其的四倍，虽然它的人口仅为土耳其的七分之一。
    库拉河两岸的一片灌溉沃田，现在随着水利工作的发展，面积也扩大了许多。1913年阿塞拜疆的棉花产量才六万四千吨，1956年已是三十五万二千吨，今年就要达到四十万吨了。丝、茶和水果也是这一带的名产。
    革命前，人口三百多万的阿塞拜疆，90％的居民是文盲。现在共和国已经有三千六百多所中小学，十五所高等学校，八十个科学研究机关。首都巴库已成为一个繁华美丽的大都市。共和国四分之三以上的工业，都集中在巴库。（君）（附图片）
