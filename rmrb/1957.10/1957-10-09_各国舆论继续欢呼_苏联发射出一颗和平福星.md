Xinhua News Agency report: World opinion continues to hail the miracle of the Soviet Union's successful launch of an artificial satellite, commenting on the significant implications of this great achievement from various perspectives.

    Newspapers in many countries point out that the Soviet Union's launch of the first artificial satellite demonstrates that the Soviet Union has surpassed the United States in science and technology, and that the socialist system is superior to the capitalist system. The East German "Neues Deutschland" wrote that the artificial satellite orbiting the earth is not only sending a signal of a great technological invention to the world, but also predicting to people that the future will belong to socialism. The "Hungarian National Daily" emphasized that the Soviet Union has greatly surpassed the United States in both the manufacture of intercontinental rockets and the launch of artificial satellites. An editorial in Albania's "People's Voice" stated that the Soviet Union's launch of an artificial satellite is a new and brilliant achievement of Soviet science. This achievement convincingly demonstrates to the world that the socialist system has incomparable superiority over the capitalist system. North Korea's "Rodong Sinmun" commented that mankind sees the realization process of mankind's long-term ideal—communist society—from the great achievements of the Soviet people; in the future, mankind will be able to see the realization of another beautiful ideal of mankind—space travel—in reality.

    The media in many countries emphasized the great significance of this event for world peace, considering it a clear demonstration of the Soviet Union's love of peace. Some newspapers and political figures particularly pointed out the urgency and possibility of peaceful cooperation among countries, and it is also a head-on blow to those warmongering aggressive forces.

    Indian Prime Minister Nehru, who is currently visiting Japan, said at a press conference in Tokyo on the 7th that the Soviet Union's successful launch of an artificial Earth satellite demonstrates great progress in science and technology. Prime Minister Nehru believes that people need to adapt to such changes, that is, they must change their political thinking on issues such as disarmament. He believes that the world must adjust the distance between the progress of science and technology and the development of international politics.

    Japan's "Akahata" called the Soviet Union's launched artificial satellite a "peaceful star of fortune orbiting the earth." The Burmese "People's Daily" also believes that the successful launch of the Earth satellite is good news for peace-loving people around the world. The newspaper said that because the Soviet Union, which advocates banning nuclear weapons tests and was the first to use atomic energy for peaceful purposes, is the pillar of world peace, this great invention in the hands of Soviet scientists will surely guarantee its peaceful application and contribute to mankind's conquest of the universe. The editor-in-chief of Egypt's "Al Shaab" published an article on October 7 stating that the Soviet Union's artificial Earth satellite, from a political point of view, will cause those countries allied with the United States to reconsider their attitudes and recognize the importance of active neutrality. It will also force "the United States to reconsider its policies of aggression, terror, and preparation for war." He said, "This will lead to the strengthening of the national liberation movement and the expansion and consolidation of the peace camp." An editorial published in "Egyptian Mail" believes that the Soviet Union's artificial satellite has destroyed the "Eisenhower Doctrine." United Press reporter Franz also wrote that the new era of world science initiated by the Soviet Union's launch of the artificial Earth satellite will be a test of the "political vision of Western politicians." Because of this event, "the desire for international political cooperation will gain new strength... Small countries in the world that crave economic development will tend to those countries that can convincingly demonstrate that they have strong peaceful purposes."

    各国舆论继续欢呼
    苏联发射出一颗和平福星
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：世界各国舆论继续欢呼苏联发射人造卫星成功的奇迹，并从各种角度评论苏联这一巨大成就的重要意义。
    不少国家的报纸指出：苏联发射出第一个人造卫星说明苏联在科学技术方面超过了美国，说明社会主义制度比资本主义制度优越。民主德国的“新德意志报”写道，环绕地球飞行的人造卫星不仅是在向世界发出伟大技术发明的信号，它并且预告人们：未来将属于社会主义。“匈牙利民族报”着重指出，苏联不论是在制造洲际火箭方面或是在发射人造卫星方面都大大超过了美国。阿尔巴尼亚“人民之声报”的社论写道，苏联发射人造卫星这件事是苏联科学的一个新的光辉成就。这个成就令人信服地向全世界表明，社会主义体系比资本主义体系有不可比拟的优越性。朝鲜的“劳动新闻”评论说，人类从苏联人民的伟大成就中看到了人类长久的理想——共产主义社会的实现过程；今后人类将能够在现实中看到人类的另一个美好的理想——宇宙旅行的实现。
    许多国家的舆论强调这个事件对世界和平的重大意义，认为是苏联爱好和平的明证。有些报刊和政界人士特别指出它显示了各国和平合作的迫切性和可能性，同时也是对那些好战的侵略势力的当头棒喝。
    正在日本访问的印度总理尼赫鲁7日在东京的记者招待会上说：苏联发射人造地球卫星获得成功，表明了科学上和技术上的巨大进步。尼赫鲁总理认为，人们需要使自己适应这样的变化，即他们必须在裁军这样的问题上改变他们的政治思想。他认为世界必须调整科学技术的进步和国际政治的发展之间的距离。
    日本的“赤旗报”把苏联发射的人造卫星叫做“围绕地球飞行的和平福星”。缅甸“人民报”也认为发射地球卫星的成功是对世界爱好和平人民的一个喜讯。这家报纸说，由于主张禁止核武器试验和第一个把原子能用于和平目的的苏联是世界和平的支柱，所以这个伟大的发明掌握在苏联科学家手中就一定会保证它的和平应用，并且为人类征服宇宙作出贡献。埃及的“人民报”主笔10月7日发表文章说，苏联的人造地球卫星，从政治方面来说，它将使那些同美国联盟的国家重行考虑它们的态度和认识到积极中立的重要性。它还将使“美国不得不重新考虑它的侵略、恐怖和准备战争的政策”。他说，“这将引起民族解放运动的加强以及和平阵营的扩大和巩固”。“埃及新闻”发表的社论认为，苏联的人造卫星摧毁了“艾森豪威尔主义”。美国合众社记者弗朗兹也写道，由苏联发射人造地球卫星所开创的世界科学的新纪元将是对“西方国家的政治家们的政治远见”的考验。由于这个事件，“对国际政治合作的渴望将获得新的力量……世界上渴望经济发展的小国家将倾向于那些能够极令人信服地证实具有强烈的和平目的的国家。”
