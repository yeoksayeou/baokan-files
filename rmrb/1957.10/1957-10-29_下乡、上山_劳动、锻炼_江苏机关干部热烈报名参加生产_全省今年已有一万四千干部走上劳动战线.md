Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 26th. A surge of enthusiasm has swept through the Jiangsu Provincial-level government cadres and Nanjing Municipal government cadres to go to the mountains and countryside to become farmers and build a new socialist countryside. In many government offices, more than 90% of cadres have signed up to participate in labor. Currently, 103 out of 105 Party members in the Jiangsu Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative have signed up, requesting to participate in physical labor and improve themselves through training in production. The Supply and Marketing Cooperative's wall newspaper and the sides of the office are covered with pledges. Party member Jiang Xilin wrote in his "Repeated Request" pledge: "Going to the agricultural labor front, this determination of mine is unwavering... To become a good Party member, one must go to labor to train, and go to difficult places to be tested." On the blackboard newspaper of the Light Industry Bureau of the Industrial Department, a large red paper was posted with the heading "Respond to the Party's Call, Go to the Countryside to Participate in Agricultural Production," with the signatures of thirty to forty people. All the cadres of the Provincial Party Committee's Organization Department have signed up. The Provincial Department of Commerce and its affiliated companies currently have 468 people signed up. Some comrades even held family meetings before signing up, to persuade their spouses and mothers. Many staff members of the Aquatic Products Department expressed their firm obedience to the organization's assignment, and would go wherever they were needed.

　　Out of the 420 cadres of the Nanjing Construction Engineering Bureau who applied to participate in labor production, 258 have been approved to go to construction sites as workers or apprentices.

　　In the first half of this year, more than 14,000 cadres throughout Jiangsu Province have participated in various forms of production labor, of which more than 10,000 cadres have returned to the countryside and have already become one with the masses on the agricultural production front. After these cadres participated in agricultural production, they not only greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of the broad masses in building a new socialist countryside, but also further strengthened the relationship between the Party and the masses. The masses in Jiading County reflected: "The Communist Party's cadres are truly capable, skilled in both writing and fighting."
