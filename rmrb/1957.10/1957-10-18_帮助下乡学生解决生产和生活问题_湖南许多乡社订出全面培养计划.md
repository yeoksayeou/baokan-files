　　Helping Educated Youth Solve Production and Living Problems

    Hunan Many Townships and Communes Formulate Comprehensive Training Plans

    (Our report) Changsha, Hunan Province, has adopted various measures to solve the various difficulties encountered by primary and secondary school graduates after participating in production.

    Many townships and communes in the Xiangtan and Changde Special Zones have formulated comprehensive plans for cultivating and improving the educated youth who have gone to the countryside. The Fengxiangping Cooperative in Liangshui Township, Yuanling, plans to have the Communist Youth League branch give the students a League lesson every half month to help them improve their socialist ideological awareness. In terms of labor, in order to take care of their physical strength, they have adopted the practice of gradually improving their labor capacity, and have invited experienced old farmers to teach the students production technology knowledge. The cooperative also plans to use the method of masters teaching apprentices to enable students to basically learn the techniques of plowing, weeding, planting rapeseed and radishes after the autumn and winter production seasons. In order to continue to improve the cultural and scientific knowledge of the educated youth who have gone to the countryside, they have formed amateur self-study groups. In terms of life, before the students form their own families, they continue to eat with the households where they live. The township also plans to organize them to participate in various recreational activities and other social activities to further connect with the masses. The Huadong Agricultural Cooperative in Huage Township, Nanxian County, purchased tools for eight educated youths and solved the difficulty they had in lacking money to buy them. It also helped them set up a self-study group and invited comrades from the agricultural technology promotion station to give them three or four agricultural technology classes every week. During the harvest season, the Gongtong Agricultural Cooperative in Shatou Township, Yiyang, organized old farmers to provide specific guidance to the educated youth who went to the countryside, so that they quickly learned the techniques of harvesting rice.

    Because of the strengthening of political and ideological leadership and the proper arrangement of specific issues for the graduates who went to the countryside, they were deeply moved. The vast majority of the sixty-three primary and secondary school graduates who went from Changsha to the Xiangtan Special Zone have already settled down in the countryside and have begun to be interested in agricultural production. Yang Dingxing, a junior high school graduate from Xinhuang Dong Autonomous County, was elected as the captain of the youth shock team by the commune members in just over ten days because he was actively engaged in production and connected with the masses. After completing the work tasks assigned by the team, many young people also helped the team record work points, helped the host households dig soil, carry water, boil water, and take care of children, or taught the young people in the commune to sing and made friends with the rural youth. The commune members all reflected, "This group of students is both literate and martial, which is really good!" (Lu An)

　　帮助下乡学生解决生产和生活问题
    湖南许多乡社订出全面培养计划
    本报讯　湖南省采取各种措施，解决中小学毕业生参加生产后的各种困难。
    湘潭、常德两个专区许多乡、社都对下乡毕业生作出了全面培养提高的计划。沅陵凉水井乡枫香坪社计划由团支部半月给学生上一次团课，帮助他们提高社会主义思想觉悟；在劳动方面，为照顾他们的体力，采取逐步提高劳动能力的做法，并请有经验的老农给学生讲授生产技术知识。这个社还计划通过师傅带徒弟的办法，经过秋、冬两季生产，让学生基本上学会犁田、打草、种油菜、萝卜等技术。为了继续提高下乡学生的文化科学知识，他们组成业余自学小组。在生活方面，学生自己未成家以前，继续在搭住户开伙。乡里还计划组织他们参加各项文娱活动和其他社会活动，达到进一步联系群众的目的。南县华阁乡华东农业社为八个知识青年购置了工具，解决了他们缺钱购买的困难；并帮助他们成立自学小组，请农业技术推广站的同志每周给他们上三、四次农业技术课。益阳沙头乡共同农业社在抢收期间，组织老农对下乡青年进行具体指导，使他们很快就学会了割稻打谷的技术。
    由于加强了对下乡毕业生的政治思想领导和具体问题的妥善安排，使他们十分感动。由长沙市下到湘潭专区的六十三个中小学毕业生，绝大部分已经在农村安下身来，开始对农业生产有了兴趣。新晃侗族自治县初中毕业生杨顶兴回农村后，因为积极生产，联系群众，仅十多天就被社员们选为青年突击队的队长。许多青年在做完队里分配的工作任务后，还帮助队上记工分，帮寄住户挖土、担水、烧水、带小孩，或教社里的青年们唱歌，跟农村青年交上了朋友。社员们都反映：“这群学生能文能武，真是不错！”　　（麓安）
