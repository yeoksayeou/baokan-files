    Over Seven Hundred Track and Field Athletes Show Their Skills at Nanjing Wutaishan
    Four National Records Broken on the First Day of the Games

    (Our newspaper Nanjing, 6th dispatch) The 1957 National Track and Field Games opened today at the Wutaishan Stadium in Nanjing. 743 outstanding track and field athletes from 27 representative teams across the country participated in the Games. In today's competition, four events broke national records.

    The women's Group A high jump final attracted the entire audience. Zheng Fengrong won first place with a score of 1 meter 68 centimeters. This result broke the national record of 1 meter 61 centimeters, surpassing the 1 meter 67 centimeter result of the second place winner at the 16th Olympic Games and the 1 meter 66 centimeter result of the first place winner at the Third International Youth Friendship Games; however, this result was still 4 centimeters short of the 1 meter 72 centimeter record she set in Democratic Germany in August of this year. Kong Lingrong, a seventeen-year-old high school student from the Beijing team, unexpectedly jumped 1 meter 54 centimeters and took second place. Fu Xueyan, who once created the national record of 1 meter 61 centimeters, failed to clear the height of 1 meter 50 centimeters three times in a row and therefore finished third.

    In the men's Group A long jump competition, Gao Shugui of Shanghai defeated Zhang Qishan of the People's Liberation Army, the national record holder, with 7 meters 28 centimeters.

    Li Zhonglin of the Beijing team, the national record holder, still won the men's Group A 800-meter champion, with a time of 1 minute 56.1 seconds. In the women's Group A 200-meter final, Jiang Yumin took first place with 25.6 seconds.

    The men's 10,000-meter race held on the afternoon of the 6th was very intense. Fu Shenghai, the national record holder with rich competition experience, ran at the very back until the fourteenth lap, but starting from the fifteenth lap, he accelerated and overtook the runners in front of him, and the audience immediately responded with warm applause. At this time, Wan Lübai of the People's Liberation Army, who recently broke the national record, closely followed. In the end, Fu Shenghai won first place with 31 minutes 38.4 seconds, and Wan Lübai won second place with 31 minutes 39.6 seconds. The third place winner was Jin Dinghao from Liaoning (31 minutes 52 seconds). Their results all broke the national record of 31 minutes 53.6 seconds.

    In the men's Group A discus final, Li Menglin, an athlete from the People's Liberation Army, broke the national record of 43 meters 95 centimeters with 44 meters 60 centimeters and won first place.

    In the men's Group A pole vault final, Cai Yishu and Xu Tiquan both jumped over 4 meters 10 centimeters. Their results reached the standard of Master of Sport.

    Today's results in the men's Group A 100-meter final were not ideal. Liang Jianxun of the People's Liberation Army won first place, but his result was only 11 seconds. Liu Jingren, who was expected to perform the best, only finished fourth, with a result of 11.5 seconds. (Tie Min, Yu Zhong)

    七百多田径运动员在南京五台山大显身手
    运动会第一天打破四项全国纪录
    本报南京6日电　1957年全国田径运动会今天在南京五台山运动场开幕。各地27个代表队的743名优秀田径选手参加了这次运动会。在今天的比赛中，有四项比赛成绩打破了全国纪录。
    女子甲组跳高决赛吸引了全场观众。郑凤荣以1公尺68公分的成绩获得第一名。这个成绩打破了1公尺61公分的全国最高纪录，超过了十六届奥运会第二名1公尺67的成绩和第三届国际青年友谊运动会第一名的1公尺66的纪录；但是，这个成绩比她今年8月在民主德国创造的1公尺72的纪录还差4公分。北京队十七岁的高中学生孔令蓉，出人意料之外地跳过了1公尺54公分，夺得第二。曾经创造1公尺61公分全国最高纪录的傅雪雁接连三次没有跳过1公尺50公分的高度，因此屈居第三名。
    在男子甲组跳远比赛中，上海运动员高树贵以7公尺28公分战胜了全国纪录保持者——解放军的张启山。
    男子甲组八百公尺冠军，仍然被全国纪录保持者北京队的李忠林夺得，成绩是1分56秒1。女子甲组二百公尺决赛，姜玉民以25秒6取得第一名。
    6日下午进行的男子一万公尺竞赛非常剧烈。有着丰富比赛经验的全国纪录保持者傅生海，在第十四圈以前一直跑在最后面，但是到第十五圈开始时，他加快了速度，步步超过前人，全场观众立即报以热烈的掌声。这时，最近打破全国纪录的解放军万吕柏紧紧跟追。最后傅生海以31分38秒4获得第一名，万吕柏以31分39秒6获第二名，第三名是辽宁的金丁浩（31分52秒），他们的成绩都打破了31分53秒6的全国最高纪录。
    在男子甲组铁饼决赛中，解放军运动员李孟林以44公尺60公分打破了43公尺95公分的全国最高纪录，获得第一名。
    男子甲组撑竿跳高决赛，蔡艺墅和许体权都跳过了4公尺10公分。他们的成绩达到了运动健将标准。
    今天男子甲组百公尺决赛的成绩不够理想。解放军的梁建勋得了第一，但他的成绩仅仅达到11秒。人们寄予希望最大的刘敬仁，只获得第四名，他的成绩是11秒5。　（铁民、毓忠）
