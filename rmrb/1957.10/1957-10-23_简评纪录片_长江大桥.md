    Brief Review of the Documentary "Yangtze River Bridge"
    Huang Gang
    The documentary "Yangtze River Bridge," produced by the Central Newsreel and Documentary Film Studio, has been released. This documentary film was completed and released four days after the official opening of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge. This rapidly produced documentary film was completed ahead of schedule by the newsreel and documentary film staff, in the spirit of the heroic construction team of the Yangtze River Bridge project. The rapid completion of the film demonstrates that the heroic achievements of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge have had a good influence and promoting effect on the work spirit of filmmakers. In addition, it can also be said that this film is one of the new gifts that filmmakers dedicate to the construction of the motherland. In recent years, the newsreel and documentary film workers of our country have been working hard to quickly reflect the socialist construction of the motherland, and to quickly reflect important themes in domestic and foreign political life. This positive working spirit and political enthusiasm, which emphasizes the timely production of newsreel films, is something that our film audiences are happy and welcome.
    From this short (only about thirty minutes of screening time) documentary film "Yangtze River Bridge," people can not only see the grand occasion in Wuhan before and after the official opening of the bridge, but also, through the varied eyes of the news film camera (some wonderful shots), witness the heroic labor of the bridge builders on the Yangtze River, and be infected by the unprecedented joy of the people of Wuhan, who are immensely happy for the achievements of the socialist cause of the motherland. The film also devotes considerable space to recording the important guidance and assistance provided by Soviet experts during the construction of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge. Based on the great contribution of Soviet experts in cooperating with Chinese engineering personnel on the Wuhan bridge construction site, the authors rightfully understand the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge as the crystallization of Sino-Soviet friendship, and rightfully use the image of the film to publicize the unparalleled superiority of our socialist system. These are all done correctly. A special feature of this documentary film is that the authors attach great importance to, and are very good at, inserting lyrical activities of ordinary people that are inseparable from the labor itself in the process of reflecting the completion of the project. For example, after the steel beams of the bridge are joined together, the film inserts a section of the happy mood and rest activities of various engineering personnel, including some Soviet experts, reflecting the mental outlook of the people after the bridge project is basically completed. For another example, after the bridge road surface is also paved, the author's shots and commentaries on overseas Chinese students and Young Pioneers coming to visit the bridge are also ingenious and show the creators' deep thinking. When recording the high-altitude operations of the bridge, the cameramen of this documentary also bravely climbed to the high-altitude positions on the river surface, following the footsteps of the bridge workers, and selected high-altitude shooting angles. These valuable pictures taken from high altitude enrich the audience's vision, and the responsible and heroic fighting spirit of the film photographers, who are learning from the working class, is also very worthy of our praise and gratitude.
    This film has obvious social value, as it helps people understand and recognize the achievements of our country's socialist cause. However, we can also clearly feel some of its shortcomings and deficiencies. One of its obvious and most important shortcomings is that it lacks a historical and overall description of the process of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge's completion and its overall appearance after completion. For example, the part of the film that directly describes the bridge construction site operations starts with the introduction when some bridge piers have already emerged from the water. In this way, the film should not have omitted the construction history of the latest bridge foundation that Soviet experts designed and our engineering personnel successfully applied (which is now world-famous) the "caisson drilling method" before the construction of the bridge piers. The adoption of this construction method is one of the important keys to the smooth and early completion of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge. Furthermore, the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge project is not only a large bridge on the Yangtze River, but a complex collection of many engineering structures. Regarding this point, what we can ask of this film is that, at least after describing the completion of the main bridge section, the authors should use the camera to find some ways to lead our audience to observe the entire appearance of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge. This cannot but include other bridges across the Han River and related overpasses, as well as some brand-new cityscapes related to Wuhan. Otherwise, the audience will not understand the true scale and overall appearance of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, which will weaken the documentary effect of the newsreel film and its propaganda effect.
    Secondly, the film's description of the realization of the ideal of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge still lacks some depth. The authors of the film are relatively good at and accustomed to general scenes of joy (flowers, smiling faces, singing, etc. - of course, this is also necessary). They even used very clever techniques to record some details of the Wuhan climate being hot and the workers' hard work in the heat, conveying the heroic spirit of the sacred labor of the working class, which is very impressive. However, the authors of the film are not good at capturing other typical images with the characteristics of the times and ideological significance in the observation of life before and after the completion of the construction site to express profound thoughts, which is regrettable. For example, people have seen that the revolutionary elder He Xiangning, despite her old age and frailty, sat in a patient's wheelchair to watch the completed bridge the day before the official opening, and expressed her deep feelings as a revolutionary pioneer to the reporters beside her. In front of this solemn, magnificent, and important socialist building, people have reason to ask the authors of the film documentary - who are image-based historical recorders and image-based political commentators - to have more bold lyrical expression and deeper ideological depth. Unfortunately, these aspects still show that the filmmakers' observation ability is not deep enough and not proactive enough, which has become a shortcoming of the film.
    When this documentary film, which is worth seeing and quickly completed, is released, we warmly welcome it on the one hand, and at the same time, we begin to put forward some of the most important requirements in a preliminary and concise way. The significance lies in illustrating that we can draw on both the successful and deficient experiences and lessons from the creation of this documentary film. We affirm the achievements with a research attitude and also see the obvious shortcomings. In this way, it may help our newsreel filmmakers to present our audience with better creative works in the future and promote them to achieve a deeper integration in their work with the actual construction of the motherland.

    简评纪录片“长江大桥”
    黄钢
    中央新闻纪录电影制片厂摄制的“长江大桥”已经上演了。这部纪录电影完成和上演在武汉长江大桥正式通车四天以后；这部迅速制成的纪录影片，是新闻纪录影片的工作人员本着长江大桥建桥工程队伍的奋勇精神突击和提前完成的。影片的迅速完工，说明了武汉长江大桥的英雄业绩给予电影工作者的工作精神以良好的影响和推动的作用；另外也可以说这部影片是电影工作者献给祖国建设的新礼品之一。我国的新闻纪录电影的工作者们，近年来一直都在努力迅速地反映祖国的社会主义建设，努力迅速地反映国内外政治生活中的重要题材，这种重视新闻纪录影片及时出品的积极工作精神与政治热情，是值得我们电影观众高兴和欢迎的。
    从“长江大桥”这一部短短的（只占三十分钟左右的放映时间）纪录影片里，人们不但可以看到大桥正式通车前后武汉当地的盛况，而且还可以经过新闻电影摄影机多变化的眼睛（它那一些精彩的镜头），目睹桥梁建设者在长江江面上英勇的劳动，以及感染到为祖国社会主义事业的成就而无比欢跃的武汉人民的空前喜悦情绪。这部影片也用相当的篇幅记载了苏联专家给予武汉长江大桥建设过程中的重要指导与帮助的作用。影片的作者们根据苏联专家们在武汉桥梁工地上与中国工程人员合作的巨大贡献，理所当然地把武汉长江大桥理解成为中苏友谊的结晶，理所当然地借助电影的形象来宣扬我们社会主义制度的无比优越性，这些都是做得正确的。这部纪录影片特出的地方，是作者们很重视、也很善于在反映工程建成的过程中去插写与劳动本身不可分割的一般人们的抒情活动。例如影片在大桥钢梁合龙的部分以后，就插入了一节各种工程人员，包括部分苏联专家们的舒畅心情与休息时活动的情景，反映出大桥工程基本上完成后的人们心理面貌；又例如等到大桥公路路面也铺设完成后，作者们对于华侨学生与少先队员们来到桥头参观的一些镜头和解说词，也是别具匠心而显出是经过创作者的深思的。这部纪录片的摄影员同志们在纪录桥梁的高空作业时，也很英勇地登上了江面高空的位置，跟随着桥梁工人的足迹，选取了高空的拍摄角度。这些从高空俯摄的一些珍贵的画面丰富了观众们的视野，而电影摄影人员的这种向工人阶级看齐的负责的和英勇的战斗作风，也是很值得我们表扬和感谢的。
    这部影片有它的明显的社会价值，它帮助了人们了解与认识我国社会主义事业的成就。但我们也能够很明显地感觉到它所具有的一些缺点与不足之处。它的很明显与最重要的缺点之一，是它对于武汉长江大桥建成的过程及其建成后的全貌，非常缺少历史的与整体的描写。例如这部影片中直接描写到桥梁工地作业的部分，是从有一部分桥墩已经露出水面的时候开始作介绍的，这样，影片也就很不应该地略去了修筑桥墩以前，苏联专家设计与我国工程人员应用成功（如今已经是举世闻名的）以“管柱钻孔法”进行施工的最新桥梁基础的建成历史；而采用这一施工方法正是武汉长江大桥得以顺利与提前完工的重要关键之一。又如，武汉长江大桥工程，不单是长江上的一座大桥，而是一个复杂的、许多工程建筑物的总合，关于这一点，我们所能要求于这部影片的，至少是在描写到它的大桥的正桥部分完工以后，作者们应该通过摄影机，想些办法，带引我们观众去观察一下有关武汉长江大桥的全貌，那就不能不包括跨越汉水的其它桥梁和有关的跨线桥及武汉有关的一些崭新的市容等等，不然，就不会使得观众了解武汉长江大桥真正的规模及其整体的面貌，而减弱了新闻纪录影片的纪实作用和它的宣传效果。
    其次，影片对于武汉长江大桥建成理想的实现的描写，还是缺少一些深度的。影片的作者们比较擅长和习惯于一般的欢愉场面（鲜花、笑脸、歌唱等等——当然这也是必要的）描写，甚至这些作者们对于武汉气候炎热而工人同志们在盛暑中的艰辛操作的一些细节纪录也都运用了很聪颖的表现手法，由这里传达出工人阶级神圣劳动的奋勇精神，给人印象很深；但是，影片作者们却不善于在工地完工前后生活的观察中猎取另一些具有时代特征与思想意义的典型形象来表达深刻的思想，这是令人感到遗憾的。比方说：人们都看到革命先辈何香凝老人尽管年老体弱，但她在正式通车前一天就坐在病人用的手推车上去观看建成后的大桥，并向身旁的报界记者表露了她——一位革命前驱——的深切感受。人们在这一庄严雄伟而又重要的社会主义建筑物面前，有理由要求电影纪录片的作者——他们是形象化的历史的记载者与形象化政论的艺术家——具有更多的大胆抒写与更深刻的思想深度。可惜，这些方面还都表现出影片作者们的观察能力不够深刻，不够主动，以致成了影片的不足之处。
    在这部值得一看和迅速完成的纪录影片上演时，我们一方面十分欢迎，同时也开始初步地、扼要地提出一些最主要的要求，其意义在于说明：我们可以从这部纪录片的创作上吸取到成功的与缺点部分的两方面经验与教训。我们抱着研究的态度肯定成绩也看到明显的缺点，这样，也许会有助于我们新闻纪录电影工作者在将来以更好的创作成品来献给我们的观众，促使他们在工作中与祖国建设事业的实际取得更深一步的结合。
