    The Beginning of Integration with Workers and Peasants

    After listening to Vice President Hu Xikui's report on streamlining institutions and increasing production and practicing economy, students at Renmin University of China requested to participate in physical labor, cleaning dormitories, classrooms, dining halls, and the campus environment. This not only reduces the number of service staff on campus, but more importantly, all students can receive labor training. Everyone also proposed, under the leadership of the school and the student union, to organize students regularly and systematically to participate in voluntary labor in rural areas, factories, and neighborhoods.

    On October 13, more than 300 students from the Department of Journalism voluntarily signed up to participate in voluntary labor at the Taiyangsheng Agricultural Cooperative outside Dongzhimen. Although the students walked a lot that day, everyone was in a happy mood. Because this is the first lesson in labor, the beginning of integration with workers and peasants.

    与工农群众结合的开始
    中国人民大学学生听了胡锡奎副校长关于精简机构，增产节约的报告后，都要求参加体力劳动，打扫宿舍、教室、饭厅和校内环境卫生。这不但可以减少校内勤杂人员，更重要的是全体同学可以受到劳动的锻炼。大家还提出了在学校与学生会的领导下，长期地有计划地组织同学参加农村、工厂、街道的义务劳动。
    10月13日，新闻系三百余名同学自愿报名到东直门外太阳升农业社参加义务劳动。在这一天的劳动中，尽管同学们走了许多路，但每个人的心情是愉快的。因为这是劳动的第一课，是与工农群众结合的开始。
