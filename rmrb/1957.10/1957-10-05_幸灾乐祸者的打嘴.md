    Slapping the Face of the Schadenfreude
    Zhuang Nong
    The National Day was spent joyfully, but a small unfinished matter comes to mind. It was just when our whole country was about to celebrate National Day that a reporter from the American Associated Press sent a telegram from Hong Kong. From this, he launched a grand theory saying that "China is more concerned with domestic problems than the situation in Taiwan." It is said that this is because "today, the Communist Party is facing serious difficulties at home, perhaps even more severe than the difficulties in 1949." So, I quickly looked to see what "serious difficulties," "more severe than in 1949," the Associated Press reporter was warning about? It turned out to be "anti-communist criticisms are rising. Food shortages" and so on. Moreover, "Communist economists find themselves on a merry-go-round, trying to accelerate the industrialization of backward China. But to do this, they must increase food production, but natural disasters (such as floods and droughts) have reduced production." According to his deduction, it is not only "difficulties," but also a vicious cycle; and "natural disasters" also have a class nature, deliberately helping them to antagonize and sabotage China. It seems that the Chinese people have no way out, but the end of the telegram says that "but to realize the socialist paradise they have been promising to China's 600 million people for eight years, they still have a long way to go." Then, no matter how "long a way" it takes, this "socialist paradise" will eventually "be realized." Wouldn't the kind of desperate "difficulties" the reporter described therefore become sensational and malicious rumors? No wonder the Chinese people still want to be happy and sing.
    We are not so confused as to expect the people of the Associated Press to speak fairly for us. But a few words must now be answered to this foolish malicious hype.
    Mr. Associated Press reporter, separating "Taiwan" and "China's internal affairs" shows their desire to permanently occupy Taiwan, which is nothing more than showing their slave status and is not worth mentioning. But the Chinese people, in addition to caring about "internal affairs" (including their own Taiwan Province), also care about international affairs. Recently, the Chinese people have repeatedly expressed their support for the Syrian people in their opposition to American imperialism, which can be regarded as evidence. The people of Syria are therefore happy. American ambitious people hate this to the bone, but they can't do anything about it.
    We do not deny that there are still difficulties in our socialist construction, and we have not forgotten these difficulties even while celebrating National Day. But what the Associated Press listed is not necessarily all of them. Take "anti-communist criticisms are rising" for example. I don't know what kind of "criticism" it refers to. If it is the attack of the Rightists, sorry, it has already "disappeared." Moreover, the attack of the Rightists has not caused much difficulty, but has awakened more people's socialist consciousness and enthusiasm. The "rising" anti-Rightist struggle is clear proof. The appearance of many new slogans in the parade in front of Tiananmen Square, such as "to be a knowledgeable worker," is also proof. Some people are bursting with anger at this, but they can't do anything about it. If it refers to the criticism and great debate of the people of the whole country on the shortcomings of the work in the rectification movement, this is a brilliant manifestation of the true freedom and true democracy of the Chinese people, which the American working people have never enjoyed. Here, we feel that this kind of criticism of the shortcomings of the work is not enough, and we must greatly develop it. The more this kind of criticism develops, the closer we get to the "socialist paradise." Just at hand, there are several newspapers that publish such materials. The Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant improved its work with revolutionary spirit in the rectification movement, streamlined 55% of the management personnel, and enhanced production. Workers in the XX factory reduced working hour quotas through debate, agricultural cooperatives became more consolidated through debate, those that had disbanded were restored, and individual households asked to join again. Farmers believed after debate that food was sufficient. Rural cadres improved their leadership over the cooperatives, and so on. Can this be said to be "difficulties"? Not only is it not "opposing the Communist Party," but it is truly supporting the Communist Party.
    There is no food shortage problem in our country at all. Under the leadership of the Party and the government, the people of the whole country have long been freed from the situation of freezing and starving to death before liberation, and the living standards have been greatly improved. Even in the serious situation of natural disasters, the Party and the government guarantee that no one will be allowed to starve to death. But in capitalist America, a large part of the workers often live on the edge of freezing and starvation; and when natural disasters come, tens of thousands of people die. Of course, we sympathize with the Americans who died in natural disasters, but bringing up this fact will always slap the face of the schadenfreude.
    Some people will say that we have just celebrated National Day, and it is not worth arguing with these clowns to say more happy things. I think that in addition to our joy, adding a little pain to those who are jealous of our joy is not a bad thing, and it is also a unique and interesting way to celebrate after the celebration. As for joy, as for the achievements we have gained, there is no need for me to say it. The Hong Kong reporter of the London "Times" exclaimed that the completion of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge is "one of the most amazing achievements of new China." In fact, which is a greater achievement: building a bridge or fundamentally transforming a country? The achievements in transforming the country are probably too many for my short article to write down. Therefore, let's stop here. Just let everyone think and calculate. Let's continue to sing happily, no matter who is unhappy.

    幸灾乐祸者的打嘴
    庄农
    国庆节欢乐的渡过了，却又想起一件未了的小事来。那是正当我们举国要欢庆国庆节的时候，美国的合众社的一个记者，为此从香港发了一个电讯。从中大发宏论说是“中国更为关心的是内政问题，不是台湾的情况。”据说这是因为“今天，共产党国内面临着严重的困难，或许比1949年的困难更甚。”于是赶快看合众社记者警告的“比1949年更甚”的“严重困难”是甚么？原来却是“反共产党的批评风起云涌。粮食缺乏”等等。而且，“共产党的经济学家发现他们坐在走马灯上，设法加快落后的中国工业化速度。但是要做到这一点得增加粮食产量，但是自然灾害（如水灾、旱灾）已使产量下降。”照他推断下来，不只是“困难”，而且是恶性循环；而且是“自然灾害”也有了阶级性，是有意在帮同他们来仇视和破坏中国的。看来中国人是毫无出路的了，然而电讯的结尾却又说是“但是要实现八年他们一直向中国六亿人口许诺的社会主义天堂，他们还得走很长一段路。”那末，不管走多么“很长一段路”，这“社会主义天堂”终究还是“要实现”的了。记者先生所渲染的那种绝望“困难”，岂不也因此成了耸人听闻的恶意造谣，这也就难怪中国人还要欢乐和歌唱了。
    我们还不至糊涂到这程度，竟至指望合众社的人来为我们说公道话。但对这愚蠢的恶意渲染，现在还是要回答几句。
    合众社记者先生，把“台湾”和“中国内政”分开，是表明他们想永远霸占台湾的思想，无非是为了显示其奴才身分，原无足道。但中国人除了关心“内政”（包括自己的台湾省），也还关心国际事务。最近中国人民一再表示对叙利亚人民反对美帝国主义的支持，也就算证据。叙利亚举国人民因此感到高兴。美国野心家们对此恨之入骨也没奈何。
    我们并不讳言我们社会主义建设中还有困难，而且，就在欢庆国庆的时候，也不曾忘掉这种困难。但合众社所列举的却未必尽是。拿“反共产党的批评风起云涌”来说吧。不知是指的那一种“批评”。如是右派的进攻，对不住，早已“风消云散”了。而且，右派分子的进攻，也未曾造成多大困难，倒是唤起了更多人的社会主义觉悟和积极性。反右派斗争的曾经“风起云涌”是明证。天安门前游行队伍中出现了许多新的标语比如“要作一个有知识的劳动者”也是证明。有人对这气破肚皮也没办法。如指的是全国人民在整风中的对工作缺点的批评和大辩论，这是中国人民的真自由、真民主的辉煌表现，是美国劳动人民从来也没有享受过的。在我们这里，我们却觉得这种对工作缺点的批评还不够，还要大大地发展。这种批评越发展，到“社会主义天堂”的路就越近。恰好手边就有几张报纸揭载着这样的材料。石景山钢铁厂在整风中用革命精神改进工作，精简55％的管理人员，增强生产。××工厂的工人经过辩论降低工时定额，农业合作社经过辩论更加巩固，散了的又恢复，单干户又要求参加。农民们辩论后认为粮食充足。农村干部改进了对合作社的领导，等等。这能说是什么“困难”呢？不但说不上是“反对共产党”，而且真正是拥护共产党。
    在我国根本没有粮食缺乏的问题。在党和政府的领导下，全国人民早已脱离了解放以前冻死饿死的情况，生活水平大大提高了。甚至在自然灾害的严重情况下，党和政府也保证不许饿死一个人。可是在资本主义的美国，却经常有一大部分劳动者生活在冻饿的边沿；而自然灾害到来时却有成千上万的人死亡。当然我们对死于自然灾害的美国人是同情的，但提出这事实来，总也使幸灾乐祸的人打一打嘴。
    有人会说，刚刚庆祝过国庆，多说些欢乐的话，不值得同这些小丑辩嘴。我倒认为在我们欢乐之余，给嫉视我们欢乐的人增加一点痛苦，并不算坏，而且用之来作为庆祝以后的又庆祝，倒也是一种别致和有趣的方法。至于说到欢乐，说到我们已得的成就，不用我来说，伦敦“泰晤士报”驻香港记者，就惊呼长江武汉大桥的竣工，是“新中国最惊人的成就之一”。其实建成一座大桥，和根本改造了一个国家，哪个成就更大些呢？在改造国家上的成就，怕是我的短文无法尽书的。因此还是带住了罢。只要每个人想一想算一算就行了。我们继续欢唱吧，管他谁不高兴呢。
