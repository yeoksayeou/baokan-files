Sharing Weal and Woe with the Masses
    Transferred Cadres in Wuhan Praised

    (By our correspondent) In Wuhan, various organizations are implementing the spirit of rectification while correcting mistakes and have successively transferred over 1,500 cadres to work at the grassroots level. Among them, nearly 400 cadres at the division and section levels have taken up positions as Party General Branch Secretaries, Branch Secretaries, Directors of Street Offices, or Township Heads in streets, schools, and suburban areas, while over 700 cadres of worker origin have returned to their original units to engage directly in labor production.

    After these cadres went to the grassroots level, they generally shared weal and woe with the masses, learned from the masses, and helped the masses overcome difficulties. Comrade Zhong Zengwu, former Deputy Manager of the Municipal Insurance Company, was transferred to the Nanhu Township of Hongshan District as the General Branch Secretary in July. He quickly became friends with the peasants. During the "fight against waterlogging and rescue efforts," he relied on the strength of the masses to change the centralized storage of grain to decentralized storage, reducing losses by 150,000 jin, guaranteeing the income of commune members, and winning praise from the masses. The peasants said that he was a good cadre of the Party and a good friend of the peasants. Comrade Ma Xueyou, who was transferred to the Third Construction Site of the First Company of the Wuhan Metallurgical Construction Company as the Branch Secretary, lived with the workers as soon as he arrived at the construction site and sincerely cared for the workers. Many workers shared their innermost thoughts, which they had been unwilling to talk about for many years, with him. Many comrades engaged in labor production have also created many achievements in different positions.

    和群众同甘苦共患难
    武汉下放干部受到赞扬
    本报讯  武汉市各机关贯彻边整边改精神，已陆续下放了一千五百多名干部到基层工作。其中近四百名处级和科级干部，已分别担任了街道、学校和郊区的党总支、支部书记、街道办事处主任或乡长，七百多名工人出身的干部回到原单位直接从事劳动生产。
    这些干部下到基层后，一般都能和群众共甘苦，向群众学习，并帮助群众克服困难。原任市保险公司副经理的仲增武同志，7月里调到洪山区南湖乡任总支书记以后，很快就和农民交成朋友。在“抗涝抢救”中，他依靠群众的力量，把原来集中保管的谷子，改为分散保管，减少损失十五万斤，保证了社员的收入，受到群众赞扬。农民们说他是党的好干部，农民的好朋友。下放到武汉冶金建筑公司第一公司三工地当支部书记的马学有同志，一到工地就同工人生活在一起，真诚地关心工人，许多工人把多年不愿讲的心里话都向他谈了。许多从事劳动生产的同志，也在不同岗位上创造出许多成绩。
