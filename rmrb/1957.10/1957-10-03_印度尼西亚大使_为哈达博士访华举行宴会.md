Xinhua News Agency, 2nd. The Indonesian Ambassador to China, Wirjopranoto, held a banquet tonight in honor of former Indonesian Vice President Dr. Hatta and his wife's visit to China.

Vice Chairman Zhu De and Premier Zhou Enlai were invited to attend the banquet.

Dr. Hatta and Premier Zhou Enlai spoke at the banquet.

In his speech, Dr. Hatta said that in the past eleven days, we have seen everywhere the Chinese people working hard for construction. New factories are springing up everywhere, something the old regime never even dreamed of. In the manufacture of jet aircraft, China has also surpassed some Western countries that are considered advanced.

Dr. Hatta said, "Since our two countries have shaken off the shackles of colonial rule and imperialism and achieved complete sovereignty, the relationship between our two countries has become closer and more intimate." "The ten resolutions unanimously adopted at the Bandung Asian-African Conference in 1955 strengthened this friendly relationship."

Dr. Hatta added that Indonesia and China both advocate peaceful coexistence, oppose colonialism, and defend world peace. Coupled with other factors, this has laid a solid foundation for enhancing the friendly relations between our two countries.

In his speech, Premier Zhou Enlai said to Dr. Hatta, "We share the same belief as Your Excellency, that countries with different ideologies and political systems can coexist peacefully. We also agree with your proposal for a 25-year peace agreement between the Soviet Union and the United States. The Chinese people are willing to work with the Indonesian people and peace-loving people all over the world to implement and develop the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the resolutions of the Bandung Conference." He added, "We sincerely hope that the mutual learning and mutual assistance between the people of our two countries in construction will be further strengthened."

Premier Zhou also said: "The Chinese people have always sympathized with the Indonesian people's heroic struggle against colonial oppression and for safeguarding the sovereignty and territorial integrity of their motherland. We firmly support your just struggle to recover West Irian and believe that you will achieve complete victory."

Those invited to the banquet tonight also included Vice Premiers Chen Yi, Li Fuchun, and Bo Yibo, Vice Chairman Chen Shutong, President of the China-Indonesia Friendship Association Burhan, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhang Hanfu, and heads of relevant departments.

    印度尼西亚大使
    为哈达博士访华举行宴会
    新华社2日讯  为印度尼西亚前副总统哈达博士和夫人访问中国，印度尼西亚驻中国大使维约普拉诺托在今天晚间举行宴会。
    朱德副主席和周恩来总理应邀出席了宴会。
    哈达博士和周恩来总理在宴会上讲了话。
    哈达博士在讲话中说，十一天来，我们到处都看到了中国人民为了建设而努力地劳动。新的工厂在各地涌现，这些是旧政权连想都没有想到过的。在制造喷气式飞机方面，中国也已超过了被视为先进的某些西方国家。
    哈达博士说：“自从我们两国摆脱了殖民统治和帝国主义的桎梏并取得了完整的主权之后，我们两国的关系就益加接近和密切起来了。”“1955年在万隆亚非会议上最后一致通过的十项决议加强了这种友好关系。”
    哈达博士又说，印度尼西亚和中国都主张和平共处，主张反对殖民主义和保卫世界和平，再加上其他因素，这就为增进我们两国的友好关系奠定了巩固的基础。
    周恩来总理在讲话时对哈达博士说：“我们和阁下具有同样的信念，那就是意识形态和政治制度的不同的国家可以和平共处。我们也赞成你所提出的由苏联和美国达成二十五年和平协议的建议。中国人民愿意同印度尼西亚人民和全世界爱好和平的人民一起，为贯彻和发展和平共处的五项原则和万隆会议的决议而努力。”他又说：“我们诚恳地希望，两国人民在建设事业中的互相学习和互相帮助将获得进一步的加强。”
    周总理还说：“中国人民一向同情印度尼西亚人民反对殖民主义压迫、维护祖国主权和领土完整的英勇斗争。我们坚决支持你们收复西伊里安的正义斗争，并且相信你们必将取得完全的胜利。”
    今晚，应邀出席宴会的，还有陈毅、李富春、薄一波副总理，陈叔通副委员长，中国印度尼西亚友好协会会长包尔汉，外交部副部长章汉夫，以及有关部门的负责人。
