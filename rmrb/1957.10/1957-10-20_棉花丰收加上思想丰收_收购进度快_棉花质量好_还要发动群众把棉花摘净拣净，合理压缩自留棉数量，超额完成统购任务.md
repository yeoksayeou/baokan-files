　　Cotton Bumper Harvest Plus Ideological Bumper Harvest
    Fast Procurement Progress, Good Cotton Quality
    Also Mobilize the Masses to Pick and Glean Cotton Clean, Reasonably Compress Self-Retained Cotton Quantity, Exceed the Procurement Task
    Xinhua News Agency, 17th. The national cotton procurement work has now entered a tense stage. According to statistics from the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives, as of October 5th, the country has procured more than 5 million dan of cotton, accounting for over 22% of this year's unified purchase task, a significant increase compared to the same period last year, and the procurement situation is generally good.
    According to reports from various regions, the quality of cotton procured this year is better than last year, mostly Grade 3 and 4 cotton, while last year it was mostly Grade 4 and 5 or Grade 5 and 6. Cotton fibers are generally one-sixteenth to two-sixteenths of an inch longer than last year. The moisture content of cotton is generally reduced by about 3% compared to last year. The ginning outturn rate of cotton in many places has increased by an average of about 10% compared to last year.
    From the 14th to the 16th, the Fifth Office of the State Council convened a reporting meeting on cotton procurement work in major cotton-producing provinces. The meeting believed that the main reasons for the high cotton quality and good procurement situation this year are threefold: First, this year's cotton production is higher than last year. Second, the high-yielding and high-quality fine cotton variety "Dai Zi Cotton" has been widely promoted this year. According to preliminary calculations, approximately 40 million mu of Dai Zi Cotton were planted this year, accounting for about 45% of the total cotton planting area nationwide, an increase of more than 14 million mu compared to last year. At the same time, various regions have more generally implemented the "five separations" or "four separations" (selling seed cotton does not include separate ginning) method of separating, drying, ginning, storing, and selling cotton according to cotton quality, which has accelerated the speed of cotton picking and procurement. Third, the socialist great debate currently underway in rural areas has powerfully promoted cotton procurement work. Wherever the cotton unified purchase issue is included in the content of the socialist great debate, the cotton procurement situation is better.
    In the report, everyone believed that to exceed the cotton unified purchase task, it is necessary to seize the following two main tasks on the basis of fully utilizing the above-mentioned favorable conditions. First, it is necessary to mobilize the masses to pick and glean the cotton clean, so that all cotton is brought home. According to reports from various regions, generally each mu of cotton field has about one or two jin of "eyelashes," "fallen flowers," and "stuck bud cotton" that have not been picked and gleaned clean, and some have as much as three jin. If all these scattered cottons are picked up, it can increase by one hundred and several tens of thousands of dan of cotton. Second, it is necessary to reasonably compress the quantity of self-retained cotton in cotton-producing areas to ensure that the state-stipulated cotton retention standards are not breached. In this way, cotton farmers can sell one hundred and several tens of thousands more dan of cotton to the state. How can we ensure that the state-stipulated cotton retention standards are not breached? The representatives attending the report meeting believed that the practices in Shandong, Hebei, and other provinces are relatively good. Shandong Province has adopted three methods on the basis of doing persuasive education work for cotton farmers. The first method is to distribute cash to members instead of cotton, and the agricultural cooperative deducts the amount of cotton that the entire community's population should retain according to the stipulated cotton retention standard, and then members report their actual needs, and buy as much as they need within the community without exceeding the retention standard. Or, the farmers first report their actual needs within the stipulated cotton retention quantity, and then the agricultural cooperative deducts the unified quantity retained in the community according to the actual needs and then sells it to the farmers. The second method is to give cotton for cotton and money for money within the limits of the stipulated cotton retention standards, with good cotton getting a good price and inferior cotton getting an inferior price. The third method is to organize farmers to report their actual needs within the scope of the retention standard, give money for the part that is saved and give cotton for the part that is actually needed. It is also stipulated that members generally buy cotton from the community before the end of December, and at the latest by the old calendar year. Overdue, the agricultural cooperative will sell the remaining cotton to the state. Shandong Province has taken these measures to ensure that the self-retained cotton of farmers in cotton-producing areas does not exceed two jin of ginned cotton.
    The meeting requested that cotton procurement personnel in various regions, under the leadership of the local Party committees, tap potential and strive to exceed this year's cotton unified purchase task. (Attached picture)

### 棉花丰收加上思想丰收  收购进度快  棉花质量好  还要发动群众把棉花摘净拣净，合理压缩自留棉数量，超额完成统购任务

　　棉花丰收加上思想丰收
    收购进度快  棉花质量好
    还要发动群众把棉花摘净拣净，合理压缩自留棉数量，超额完成统购任务
    新华社17日讯  目前全国棉花收购工作已经进入紧张阶段。据全国供销合作总社统计，截至10月5日止，全国共计已收购棉花五百多万担，占本年度统购任务的22％以上，比去年同期收购量增加很多，收购情况一般是良好的。
    据各地反映，今年收购的棉花品质比去年好，多为三、四级棉，而去年多为四、五级或五、六级棉。棉花纤维一般要比去年长十六分之一到十六分之二英寸。棉花的含水量一般比去年减少3％左右。棉花的衣分率在许多地方平均比去年增加10％左右。
    14到16日，国务院第五办公室召开了主要产棉省棉花收购工作汇报会议。会议认为，今年棉花质量高、收购情况好的主要原因有三：一是今年的棉花产量比去年增加。二是今年大量推广单位面积产量高、品质好的优良棉种岱字棉。据初步计算，今年大约播种了四千万亩岱字棉，占全国棉花播种总面积的45％左右，比去年增加了一千四百多万亩。同时，今年各地比较普遍地推行了按棉花质量实行分摘、分晒、分轧、分存、分售的“五分”或“四分”（出售籽棉就没有分轧）的方法，加快了棉花的采摘和收购的速度。三是农村正在进行的社会主义大辩论，有力地推动了棉花收购工作。凡是那里把棉花统购问题列为社会主义大辩论的内容，那里的棉花收购情况就较好。
    在汇报中大家认为，要超额完成棉花统购任务，必须在充分利用上述有利条件的基础上，抓住以下两个主要工作。第一，要发动群众把棉花摘干拣净，做到所有棉花全部还家。据各地反映，一般每亩棉田没有摘干拣净的“眼睫毛”、“落地花”和“僵瓣棉”约有一、二斤，多的达三斤。如果把这些散失的棉花都拣起来，就能增加一百几十万担棉花。第二，要合理地压缩棉产区自留棉的数量，保证国家规定的留棉标准不被突破。这样，棉农们就可以多拿出一百几十万担棉花卖给国家。怎样才能不致突破国家规定的留棉标准呢？参加汇报会的代表认为，山东、河北等省的做法是比较好的。山东省在对棉农做好说服教育工作的基础上，采取了三种办法。第一种办法，是给社员分现款不分棉花，由农业社按照规定的留棉标准将全社人口应留棉花扣留在社，然后由社员自报实际需要量，在不超过留棉标准的原则下，用多少在社内买多少。或者先由农户在规定的留棉数量内自报实际需要量，然后由农业社按实际需要数统一扣留在社，再卖给农户。第二种办法，是在不超过规定留棉标准的条件下，要棉给棉，要钱给钱，好棉好价，次棉次价。第三种办法，是在留棉标准范围内，组织农民自报实际需要量，属于节约的部分给钱，属于实际需要部分给棉。另外规定，社员向社内买棉一般不超过12月底，最迟到旧历年，逾期农业社将剩余棉花卖给国家。山东省采取这些办法，可以保证棉产区农民的自留棉不超过二斤皮棉。
    会议要求各地棉花收购人员，在当地党委领导下，发挥潜力，争取超额完成今年的棉花统购任务。（附图片）
