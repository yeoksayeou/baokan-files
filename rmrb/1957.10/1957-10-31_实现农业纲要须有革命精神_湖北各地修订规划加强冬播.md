To Realize the Agricultural Program Requires Revolutionary Spirit
Hubei Revises Plans and Strengthens Winter Sowing

(Our newspaper's Wuhan dispatch on the 29th) The convocation of the Third Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party and the promulgation of the revised draft of the National Agricultural Development Program are a great encouragement to the broad masses of cadres and people in Hubei Province. They are overcoming conservative thinking, tapping production potential, formulating advanced production plans, and vigorously strengthening winter sowing work.

In the Huanggang Special District, more than 1,000 cooperatives are discussing the revised draft of the National Agricultural Development Program. Many cooperatives believe that the rate of increase in grain and cotton yields stipulated in the Program is completely realistic. As long as production potential is tapped, it can not only be achieved but also exceeded. Wangcheng Township in Xishui County achieved an average grain yield of more than 1,010 jin per mu this year (the highest reaching more than 2,000 jin), an increase of three to four times compared with the average yield before cooperation, which has made the broad masses see the enormous potential for increased production. When formulating the township's production plan in conjunction with the discussion of the Agricultural Development Program, this township unanimously proposed that the grain yield reach an average of 1,300 jin per mu by 1962 and 1,500 jin per mu by 1967. According to the current situation of cooperatives formulating production plans and the fact that three or four counties in the district have already achieved an average grain yield of 800 jin per mu and two counties have achieved an average yield of 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu, the Huanggang Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China believes that in the next two or three years, other areas with roughly the same conditions will certainly be able to reach the targets stipulated in the Program. Therefore, they proposed in the plan: strive for an average grain yield of 800 jin per mu and an average ginned cotton yield of 100 jin per mu in the entire district by 1960. According to the fact that the average grain yield in Xiaogan, Huangpi, Dawu, Yunmeng and other counties has reached 800 to 950 jin, and after studying the production conditions in the entire district, the Xiaogan Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China proposed in the plan: strive for an average grain yield of 700 to 800 jin per mu in the entire district in 1958, and an average grain yield of 1,000 to 1,100 jin per mu in the entire district in 1967.

In order to ensure the realization of the increased production plan, many places are vigorously carrying out water conservancy planning. The Xiaogan Special District plans to build six large reservoirs and fifty-eight medium-sized reservoirs. Next year, 5 million mu of the district's 7.03 million mu of paddy fields will have a drought resistance capacity of 60 days, and 80,000 mu of fields can be guaranteed harvest. Many places have revised their original water conservancy plans. The Wuchang County Committee of the Communist Party of China originally only planned to repair some ponds and dikes. Now, after seeing the revised draft of the Agricultural Development Program, they criticized conservative thinking and increased the original water conservancy project from 2 million cubic meters of earthwork to 5 million cubic meters of earthwork. In this way, the county's irrigation system can be completed, and the area of guaranteed harvest of rice will increase from 50% this year to more than 70% next year. The Xiangyang Special District originally planned to convert 520,000 mu of dry land to paddy fields and expand the area of guaranteed harvest by 600,000 mu next year. Now, according to the revised plan after the water conservancy meeting in each county, the conversion of dry land to paddy fields has increased to 715,000 mu, and the area of guaranteed harvest has increased to 1 million mu.

After the Third Plenary Session, cadres in various places realized that the development of agricultural production must have a revolutionary spirit. Therefore, they have gone deep into the grassroots to strengthen the leadership of winter sowing production. In the Huanggang Special District, more than 34,000 county, district, township, and cooperative cadres have personally gone deep into production teams to cultivate winter sowing experimental fields, cultivating more than 39,000 mu of winter sowing experimental fields. More than 30,000 mu of winter sowing experimental fields have also been cultivated by cadres working in the countryside in the Xiaogan Special District. These winter sowing experimental fields have played a significant role in promoting the masses to improve the quality of winter sowing and implement new technical measures.

### 实现农业纲要须有革命精神  湖北各地修订规划加强冬播

    实现农业纲要须有革命精神
    湖北各地修订规划加强冬播
    本报武汉29日电　党的八届三中全会的召开和全国农业发展纲要修正草案的公布，对湖北省广大干部和群众是一个很大的鼓舞。他们正在克服保守思想，挖掘增产潜力，制定先进的生产规划，同时大力加强冬播工作。
    黄冈专区已有一千多个合作社在讨论全国农业发展纲要修正草案。许多合作社认为纲要规定的粮、棉产量提高的速度完全切合实际，只要把生产潜力挖掘起来，不仅能够实现并且可以超过。浠水县望城乡今年粮食平均亩产一千零一十多斤（最高的达二千多斤），比合作化前的平均产量提高三、四倍，这使广大群众看到增产的巨大潜力。这个乡在结合讨论农业发展纲要制定本乡的生产规划时，一致提出粮食产量到1962年要求达到平均亩产一千三百斤，1967年达到一千五百斤。中共黄冈地委根据目前合作社制定生产规划的情况，和根据今年全区已经有三、四个县出现粮食平均亩产八百斤、有两个县出现皮棉平均亩产一百斤的情况，认为在今后两三年内，在条件大致相同的其它地区，也一定可以达到纲要规定的指标。因此他们在规划中提出：1960年争取全区粮食平均亩产八百斤，皮棉平均亩产一百斤。中共孝感地委根据今年孝感、黄陂、大悟、云梦等县的粮食平均产量已经达到八百斤至九百五十斤，并研究了全区的生产条件，在规划中提出：1958年全区争取粮食平均亩产七百至八百斤，1967年全区粮食平均亩产一千至一千一百斤。
    为了保证增产规划的实现，许多地方都在大力进行水利规划。孝感专区计划兴修大型水库六处，中型水库五十八处，明年全区七百零三万亩水田，就有五百万亩的抗旱能力可以达到六十天，有八万亩田可以保收。许多地方修订了原来的水利规划。中共武昌县委原来只打算修补一些塘堰，现在看到农业发展纲要修正草案后，批判了保守思想，把原计划的水利工程由二百万土方增至五百万土方，这样可以修成全县的灌溉系统，水稻保收面积将由今年的50％增至明年的70％以上。襄阳专区原计划明年旱田改水田五十二万亩，扩大保收田六十万亩，现在根据各县水利会议修正规划后，旱田改水田增加到七十一万五千亩，保收田增加到一百万亩。
    各地干部在三中全会以后，都认识到发展农业生产必须具有革命的精神，因此都深入下去，加强冬播生产的领导。黄冈专区的县、区、乡、社干部亲自深入生产队培育冬播试验田的已有三万四千余人，培育冬播试验田三万九千余亩。孝感专区在农村工作的干部，也培育了冬播试验田三万多亩。这些冬播试验田，对于推动群众提高冬播质量，贯彻新的技术措施，起了很大作用。
