(Our Shanghai dispatch, 5th) This reporter today visited a vivid and unique exhibition at the Shanghai Boiler Factory – the "Exhibition Comparing Gu Liufa's Past and Present." This exhibition uses the comparison of the life of a young worker at this factory, Gu Liufa, before and after liberation to illustrate the earth-shaking changes in workers' lives in the new and old societies. Today is the first day of the exhibition's official opening, and many workers visited it with deep emotion.

The origin of this exhibition is as follows: Not long after the rectification movement began at the Shanghai Boiler Factory, Gu Liufa, a lathe operator in the factory's mechanical workshop, posted two big-character posters. In these posters, he said that workers' work now is "a waste of energy," and also used the issue of night shift workers' meals as an excuse to attack the leadership for treating workers "like shaving their heads." These two big-character posters with erroneous content aroused fierce debate among the workers, and many employees used big-character posters to refute Gu Liufa's claims, sharply pointing out that Gu Liufa's remarks were a concrete manifestation of his idea of forgetting his roots. A few people also expressed agreement with Gu Liufa's claims. In order to educate all the workers in the factory and distinguish right from wrong, the factory leadership, after obtaining the consent of Gu Liufa and his family, decided to hold this exhibition so that people could draw conclusions from the comparison of facts.

The exhibition uses pictures, photos, and objects to unfold the history of changes in a typical worker's family to visitors. The exhibition is divided into two parts. The first part is the life of Gu Liufa and his family before liberation: This was a worker's family that suffered greatly in the old society. His father was an old plasterer who had worked for more than twenty years, working hard, enduring hunger and cold. It was more than thirty miles from his home to the factory. For more than twenty years he couldn't afford the bus fare and walked to work every day. He contracted lung disease from long-term overwork, had no money for treatment, was driven out of the hospital. In order to support his family, he went back to work without a good rest, and finally died of exhaustion; He worked diligently all his life, and paid sixteen years of guarantee money to the Shanghai Water Company's yellow union, but only ended up with a thin coffin. His mother entered a textile factory at the age of fifteen, and was laid off at the age of thirty-seven because she had too many children. She had to rent land from landlords to farm, couldn't support her children, and risked her life to sell rice as a smuggler. His eldest sister, second elder brother, and third elder brother were all child laborers. Two of his elder brothers and two of his elder sisters died because they had no money for medical treatment. Gu Liufa himself also suffered the pain of apprenticeship in the old society. He entered a military uniform factory as a handyman at the age of twelve, and couldn't even sweep the floor. After working for four or five days, he had to run back home. His mother bought incense and candles for him to worship a tailor as his master. He got up at three o'clock every day and didn't sleep until late at night. He ate leftovers, had no wages, and was often beaten and scolded by the boss and his wife. After four consecutive years of apprenticeship, he still hadn't learned the skills to tailor a piece of clothing... The exhibition's pictures say: That's when workers' work was truly called "a waste of energy."

The exhibition then introduces Gu Liufa's life after liberation: Gu Liufa came to the boiler factory as an apprentice in the spring of 1950, when he was only seventeen years old. Through the cultivation of the Party and the help of experienced masters, he made rapid progress and is now a seventh-grade lathe operator, rising almost one grade every year on average. In terms of education, he only had a third-grade primary school education when he entered the factory, but now he is studying in the first year of junior high school at the factory school. He joined the Communist Youth League in 1954 and the Chinese Communist Party in 1955. Both he and his wife work in the factory, and they have only one child. The family of three has an average of more than sixty yuan of living expenses per person per month. His family situation has also completely changed. His third elder brother, who was a miscellaneous worker before liberation, was sent by the state to a secondary technical school for advanced studies after liberation, and is now working as a technician in Xi'an after graduation. A total of twenty people in his family, including brothers, sisters-in-law, and brothers, have eight people working, with a monthly wage income of nearly seven hundred yuan; six children are studying; and the current bank savings are nearly one thousand yuan. Recently, Gu Liufa is preparing to use his own savings to build a new house to live in. What a happy worker's family!

What impressed the visitors the most was some of the objects displayed in the last room of the exhibition. These are the clear contrasts of the living conditions of this worker's family in the old and new societies: a broken leather suitcase with the paint completely peeled off and the lining paper exposed, was his mother's dowry more than forty years ago, and also the only suitcase his family had before liberation. Twenty years ago, the whole family carried it to escape the disaster. A tank with a large broken piece was used to store drinking water for daily use. There is also a tattered table and a bamboo chair with the bottom tied with rope. The entire furnishings of another bedroom were just moved from Gu Liufa's home, which is part of his current living situation: a large purplish-red wooden bed is covered with clean printed bedsheets, a red satin comforter with striped cloth lining, two pairs of embroidered pillows, a mahogany dressing table, a wardrobe, two camphor wood chests, a brass spittoon, a brass washbasin, a brass foot warmer, and a "Three-Five" brand table clock. The leather shoes include deerskin, hard-soled, and rubber, as well as a pair of sports shoes specifically for playing football. Hanging in a row are a cat fur-lined black wool overcoat, a navy blue serge Zhongshan suit, thin flannel pants, a women's wool overcoat, a brocade satin women's short jacket, woolen shirts, undershirts... lined, quilted, and cotton are all available, silk, cloth, wool, and fur are all complete. …

Gu Liufa and his family have completely turned themselves around after liberation. Logically, he should love the new society and work harder. Why did he forget his roots and say such things that violated the facts and his conscience in this rectification movement? The exhibition published Gu Liufa's painful self-criticism and displayed some pictures to illustrate that this young worker has gradually become contaminated with and fostered selfish and individualistic capitalist ideas in recent years. During his apprenticeship, Gu Liufa was a good child praised by the master workers, and he received first-class grades in three technical examinations. Later, he was also rated as an advanced producer several times, but he attributed all of these to himself, forgetting the cultivation and help of the organization and the master workers. From then on, he gradually developed a sense of pride and complacency. Although the organization and comrades repeatedly warned him when he joined the Communist Youth League and the Communist Party, he did not take it seriously and only regarded it as wind in his ears. During the "anti-counterrevolutionary" campaign last year, the Party transferred him from production to engage in "anti-counterrevolutionary" work. He did not improve his class consciousness well from the movement, but instead developed the idea of ​​greed for pleasure. He only saw superficially that the staff in the department were sitting at their desks working, and thought it was very comfortable. He wanted to be a staff member or go to specialized studies and didn't want to go back to the workshop to work. In March of this year, because of production needs, he still returned to the workshop for production. At this time, the quota in the workshop had just been revised, and the productivity of the workers was gradually increasing. Gu Liufa did not meet the quota in the first month he went to the workshop and did not receive a bonus, so he was dissatisfied and complained a lot. At this time, he had forgotten that he was a Communist Party member, how to treat advanced quotas with a correct attitude, how to use his brains to find solutions, etc., he put them all behind his mind. The change in his thinking also increased his demands for material life. When he worked the night shift, he was greatly dissatisfied because the night shift food changed from pork rib noodles to plain noodles, and the night shift allowance was canceled. This was what the workers asked for, but he attacked the leadership for "shaving the workers' heads." Capitalist individualism completely overwhelmed his mind, and finally he posted two erroneous big-character posters during the mass airing of views, causing a great uproar in the factory.

This moving exhibition deeply moved the hearts of the workers. Many workers watched it while wiping away their tears. In the opinion book of the exhibition, the reporter saw many workers writing their feelings in newly learned crooked words. They believe that this is a living teaching material of the two roads of capitalism and socialism. At a pre-exhibition symposium held yesterday, six old workers tearfully recalled their experiences in the old society. They strongly condemned Gu Liufa's idea of forgetting his roots and hoped that he would thoroughly recognize and correct his mistakes. Gu Liufa also spoke at the meeting, saying that the master workers shed tears for me at the meeting today, and I will definitely use my actions in the future to make the master workers laugh.

This vivid exhibition has made the rectification movement in the Shanghai Boiler Factory more filled with profound ideological content, pushing the mass debate to a new peak. (Attached pictures)

    批判忘本思想　进行社会主义教育
    上海锅炉厂举办顾六法今昔对比展览会
    本报上海5日电　本报记者今天在上海锅炉厂参观了一个生动而别致的展览会——“顾六法今昔对比展览会”。这个展览会是通过本厂的一个青年工人顾六法解放前后的生活对比，来说明工人生活在新旧社会翻天覆地的大变化。今天是展览会正式展出的第一天，许多工人在深刻的感动中参观了这个展览会。
    这个展览会的起因是这样的：上海锅炉厂的整风运动开始不久，本厂机械车间的车工顾六法先后贴出了两张大字报，在大字报上他说现在工人干活是“白费牛虎之力”，还借口夜班工人的吃饭问题，攻击领导上对待工人“像刮胡子一样”。这两张内容错误的大字报在工人群众中引起了激烈的争论，许多职工用大字报反驳了顾六法的说法，尖锐的指出了顾六法的言论是他的忘本思想的具体表现，也有少数人对顾六法的说法表示了共鸣。为了教育全厂工人，辨明是非，厂的领导上在征得了顾六法和他家庭的同意之后，就决定举办这个展览会，让人们从事实的对比中来得出结论。
    展览会用图画、照片和实物，向参观者展开了一个典型的工人家庭的变化史。展览分为两部分，第一部分是顾六法和他家庭在解放前的生活：这是一个在旧社会里饱受苦难的工人家庭，父亲是一个干了二十多年活的老泥水工，刻苦劳动，忍饥受寒，从家里到工厂有三十多里路，二十多年来花不起车钱，天天徒步上班。长期劳苦过度染上了肺病，无钱治病，进了医院又被赶出来，为了全家生活，没有好好休息又带病上班了，终于劳累而死；勤劳一生，向上海自来水公司黄色工会交了十六年的保证金，结果只捞到一口薄板棺材。他母亲十五岁进纱厂做工，到三十七岁因为孩子多被辞退了，只得向地主租田种，养不活孩子，冒着生命危险去贩米跑单帮。他的大姊、二哥、三哥都是童工。他有两个哥哥和两个姊姊都是因病无钱治疗死去。顾六法自己也饱受旧社会学徒生活的痛苦，十二岁进军服厂当勤杂工，连地也扫不动，干了四、五天只好跑回家去。他母亲又买香烛给他拜了裁缝做师傅，每天三点钟起身，深夜才睡，吃的是剩饭，没有工资，还常受老板和老板娘的打骂，连续学了四年徒工，还没有学会裁剪一件衣服的本领……。展览会的图片说：那时候工人们干活才真叫做“白费牛虎之力”哩。
    展览会接着介绍了顾六法解放以后的生活：顾六法1950年春天到锅炉厂当学徒，那时才十七岁，经过党的培养和老师傅的帮助，进步很快，现在已是七级车工了，几乎平均每年升一级。从文化上看，进厂时他只有小学三年级程度，现在已在厂校读到初中一年级。他1954年入团，1955年参加中国共产党。他夫妻俩都在工厂工作，只有一个孩子，三口人，每人每月平均有六十多元钱的生活费。他的家庭情况也整个改变了，他那个解放前是杂务工的三哥，解放后被国家送到中等技术学校深造，毕业后现在在西安当技术员。他全家大大小小总共二十口人，哥、嫂、弟等共八人在工作，每月工资收入将近七百元；六个儿童在读书；目前银行存款就近一千元。最近顾六法准备用自己的存款盖一间新房子住。这是一个多么幸福的工人家庭！
    使参观者感受最深的，是展览会最后一室里陈列着的一些实物，这是这个工人家庭在新旧社会中生活状况的明显对比：一只油漆完全剥落、衬里纸柏外露的破碎皮箱，是四十多年前他母亲的嫁妆，也是他全家在解放前唯一的箱子，二十年前全家带着它逃过难。一只破损了一大块的缸，是用来储日常吃水的。还有一张破烂不堪的桌子，和一只用绳子绑扎着下部的竹椅。另一间卧室的全部陈设，是刚从顾六法家里搬来的，这是他现在的部分生活情况：紫红漆大木床上铺着整洁的印花被单，一床红缎面、条布里的被头，两对绣花枕头，一张红木梳妆台，一只衣橱两只樟木箱，铜的痰盂，铜的面盆，铜的脚炉，三五牌台钟。皮鞋有鹿皮的，有硬底的，也有橡胶的，还有一双踢足球专用的运动鞋。那一排挂着的是猫皮里黑呢长大衣，藏青哔叽中山装、薄花呢裤子、女子呢长大衣，织锦缎女短袄、绒线衫、卫生衫……，单夹棉俱全，绸、布、呢、毛齐备。……
    顾六法和他的家庭在解放后完全翻身了，照理他应当热爱新社会，更加勤奋地劳动，为什么他竟忘了本，在这次整风运动中说出了这种违背事实和良心的话来？展览会上发表了顾六法的沉痛检讨，陈列了一部分图片，说明这个青年工人这几年来逐渐地沾染了和滋长了自私自利、个人主义的资本主义思想。还在学徒期间，顾六法是老师傅们称赞的好孩子，三次技术考试都得到了甲等，以后还数次评为先进生产者，但他把这些一律都归功于自己，忘了组织上和老师傅对他的培养帮助，从此就逐渐滋长起骄傲自满的情绪。虽然在他入团、入党的时候，组织和同志们都再三向他提出过警告，但他没有认真接受，只当耳旁风。去年“肃反”时，党调他脱产搞“肃反”工作，他没有很好地从运动中来提高自己的阶级觉悟，却产生了贪图享乐的思想，他只从表面上看到科室中职员坐着办公，认为很舒服，心想当职员，或去专门学习，不想再回车间做工。今年3月，因为生产需要，他仍然回到了车间去生产。这时车间中定额刚修改，工人的生产率在逐渐提高，顾六法下车间第一个月定额没有达到，没有拿到奖金，于是他就不满意，大发牢骚。这时，他已忘记自己是个共产党员了，如何用正确态度来对待先进定额，如何来开动脑筋找办法等等他都放到了脑后。思想的变化，使他对物质生活的要求也提高了，他做夜班时，因为夜班伙食由排骨面改为阳春面，取消夜班津贴，这是工人们要求这样做的，但他又大为不满，攻击领导上是对工人“刮胡子”。资本主义的个人主义思想完全冲昏了他的头脑，最后终于在大鸣大放中贴出了两张错误的大字报，在全厂引起了一场轩然大波。
    这个感人的展览会深切地激动了工人们的心，不少工人一边看，一边拭着泪。在展览会的意见簿上，记者看到许多工人们用才学会的歪歪斜斜的字，写着自己的感受，他们认为这是资本主义和社会主义两条道路的一本活教材。在昨天召开的一次预展座谈会上，有六个老工人声泪俱下地回忆起自己在旧社会的遭遇。他们痛切的谴责顾六法的忘本思想，希望他彻底地认识和改正错误。顾六法在会上也讲了话，他说老师傅们今天在会上为我流了眼泪，我今后一定要用自己的行动来使老师傅们欢笑。
    这个生动的展览会，使上海锅炉厂的整风运动更加充满了深刻的思想性，把群众性的争辩推进到了一个新的高峰。（附图片）
