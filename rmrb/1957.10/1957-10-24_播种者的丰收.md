    The Sower's Harvest
    By Our Correspondent Cheng Guangrui
    Thirty-five years ago, in 1922, on the Sal steppe on the south bank of the Don River, the "Sower" commune was organized. This is today's "Stalin" Collective Farm. It is one of the prosperous collective farms that rose from the barren steppe. To understand the changes in Soviet rural areas and the lives of farmers, we visited this farm before the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution.
    The Stalin Farm is located 150 kilometers southwest of Rostov. We set off from Rostov, crossed the Don River Bridge, and the car sped southwest along the highway on the vast steppe. We arrived at the farm after about three hours. Here was a large village with greenery everywhere. We got out of the car in front of a two-story building. This is the farm's office building.
    The farm chairman, Chukhnovsky, in his fifties, was plump, with a loud voice, and enthusiastic and straightforward. While asking us to sit down and rest, he began to introduce the situation of the farm to us.
      "Before the October Revolution," Chukhnovsky said, "this was a dry steppe, often windy, and with very little rain. It was very difficult for crops to grow. At that time, only a few farmers cultivated small plots of land, and the harvest was very poor.
      "When the Sower Commune was first established, there were only sixty-five farming households, the cultivated area was very small, and the climate conditions were poor, the income was very little, and the situation was very difficult. Later, the state gave loans, the commune members worked hard, and planted windbreaks and improved the soil, and the harvest gradually improved, and the farm slowly developed.
    "However, just as the farm was developing more and more, the war broke out! During the Second World War, the Germans drove away the farm's livestock, burned down the farm's houses, and looted the farm's materials. We suffered a great disaster.
    "After the war, the villagers rebuilt their houses and restored production. Now it's different. Now the farm has more than 400 farm households and more than 4,000 hectares of cultivated land. In recent years, the farm has also planted a lot of corn and various fruit trees. In particular, the development of animal husbandry has greatly increased the farm's income. In 1949, the farm's total income was only 2.5 million rubles, in 1956 it had increased to 6.52 million rubles, and this year it will increase to 6.8 million rubles."
    Chukhnovsky didn't talk much. He led us to visit the farm.
    We first visited a dilapidated wooden house, which was built thirty-five years ago when the Sower Commune was first established, and this one is still preserved. This simple house was used as a collective dormitory and as a canteen at that time. Now it has long been submerged among the hundreds of newly built farmhouses around it. Chukhnovsky told us that the farm's more than 400 villagers now live in two residential villages, most of which are new houses.
    Then we visited several spacious pigsties and cowsheds, where fat Caucasian pigs and various dairy cows were raised. This farm has more than 1,300 cattle, more than 3,000 sheep, more than 100 horses, more than 1,800 pigs, 23,000 chickens and ducks, and 210 turkeys. At present, the villagers are working hard to increase the production of milk and meat in response to the call to "catch up with the United States."
    In addition to agriculture and animal husbandry, the Stalin Farm also has a machine repair factory, a brick and tile factory, a flour mill, a bakery, a sausage processing factory, a butter processing factory, a winery, and a power station. When we visited the winery, the villagers were transporting boxes of freshly picked grapes into the factory to prepare for winemaking.
    After coming out of the winery, Chukhnovsky led us to visit the farm's fields. This is no longer a wilderness overgrown with weeds. We saw plots of land dozens of hectares in size, surrounded by tall and neat windbreaks.
    Chukhnovsky said to us with great joy: "Last year, our farm averaged 21.5 quintals of winter wheat per hectare, 40 quintals of corn, 150 kilograms of fruit, and 130 kilograms of grapes. This year we planted 120 hectares of new fruit trees."
    Only one thing bothered the chairman: it didn't rain all summer this year. However, as luck would have it, on the way back to the village from the fields, dark clouds suddenly gathered and it began to rain.
    At dusk, we visited the homes of two villagers in the rain.
    Anna's family of five lives in a house of 60 square meters, which was renovated the year before last. Anna works in the farm's canteen, and her husband works in the fields. Last year, they had a total income of 1,200 workdays, and she also used the income of 20 workdays to buy a wardrobe with a mirror.
    Senya's family also lives well. Her family of five lives even more spaciously than Anna's family. She works in the cowshed, her husband is a construction worker on the farm, and her daughter works in the fields. Their monthly income is about 1,700 rubles. Last year, she spent 1,500 rubles to make a new suit for her son, 1,200 rubles to make a new coat for her husband, and bought a new pair of leather shoes for each of them….
    "What else did you buy?" we asked.
    "I can't even remember myself." Senya replied with a smile, "I'm also planning to buy a car. The money is ready, but I have to wait for a while."
    Yes, as the income from workdays increases, the villagers' purchasing power also increases. Chukhnovsky told us that last year, the average income per workday on this farm was 3.7 kilograms of grain, 1 kilogram of milk, 300 grams of potatoes, 150 grams of wine, 80 grams of meat, 1 kilogram of vegetables, 300 grams of sunflower seeds, 30 grams of oil, 200 grams of fruit, and 7 rubles and 35 kopecks in cash, totaling more than 30 rubles. This year it will increase to 40 rubles. In 1949, the average income per workday on this farm was only nine rubles. At that time, in addition to half a kilogram of grain, there was no milk, pork, vegetables, fruit, etc.
    We had lunch and dinner in the spacious and clean farm canteen. The farm has two public canteens, and almost all the villagers eat in the canteen. Anna told us that her family of three eats in the canteen, two meals a day, costing only five or six rubles, which is convenient and cheap. This kind of canteen is still rare in Soviet collective farms.
    In addition to the public canteen, the farm also has a middle school, sanatorium and sports ground, kindergarten and nursery, as well as parks and clubs. Villagers can watch movies three or four times a week in the club.
    After dinner, while resting in the farm chairman's office, in a casual conversation, we learned that he was the son of a farm laborer. He joined the Party in 1921. Because he had good results in the commune, he was sent to the Tsimlyansk Agricultural School to study. After graduating in 1935, he worked in the commune. During the Patriotic War, he joined the army. After the war, he worked in the district for a period of time, and then returned to the farm. He has been the farm chairman here for nine years. He witnessed the entire growth process of this farm, and he himself grew up with the growth of the farm.
    Thirty-five years ago, the seeds sown by a group of hardworking "sowers" on this barren steppe have not only blossomed and borne fruit today, but have also reaped a bountiful harvest. The wilderness here has been transformed into fertile land, poverty has been transformed into prosperity, and the poor peasants of the past have become today's builders of communism. In the socialist era, what a tremendous change has taken place in the lives of Soviet rural areas and farmers!

    播种者的丰收
    本报记者  程光锐
    三十五年前，1922年，在顿河南岸的萨里草原上，组织了一个“播种者”公社，这就是今天的“斯大林”集体农庄。它是从贫瘠的草原上兴起的富裕的集体农庄之一。为了了解苏联农村和农民生活的变化，在十月革命四十周年之前，我们访问了这个农庄。
    斯大林农庄在罗斯托夫西南一百五十公里的地方。我们从罗斯托夫出发，跨过顿河大桥，汽车沿着公路，在辽阔的草原上向西南疾驰，约摸走了三个钟头才来到农庄。这里是一个绿荫处处的大村庄。我们来到了一座两层楼房前面下了车。这里就是农庄的办公楼。
    农庄主席契霍夫斯基，五十多岁，胖胖的身材，声音宏亮，热情爽直。他一面请我们坐下来休息，一面开始向我们介绍这个农庄的情况。
      “十月革命以前，”契霍夫斯基说：“这里是一片干旱的草原，时常刮风，雨水很少。庄稼生长十分困难。当时只有少数农民在小块土地上耕种，收成很坏。
      “播种者公社刚刚建立的时候，只有六十五户农家，耕地面积很小，气候条件又差，收入很少，处境很困难。后来国家给了贷款，社员们努力经营，又栽植了防风林，改良了土壤，收成渐渐好了，农庄才慢慢发展起来。
    “然而，正当农庄越来越发展的时候，战争爆发了！在第二次世界大战期间，德国人赶走了农庄的牲口，烧掉了农庄的房舍，劫走了农庄的物资。我们遭到了一场大灾。
    “战后庄员们重修了房舍，恢复了生产。现在不同了。现在农庄共有四百多农户，四千多公顷耕地。这几年农庄又种了很多的玉米和各种果树。特别是畜牧业的发展使农庄的收入大大增加了。1949年农庄的全部收入只有二百五十万卢布，1956年已增加到六百五十二万卢布，今年还要增加到六百八十万卢布。”
    契霍夫斯基没有谈得很多，他就领着我们去参观农庄。
    我们先去参观了一座破旧的木房子，这就是三十五年前播种者公社刚成立的时候盖的，现在还保存下来这一座。这座简陋的房子当时作集体宿舍也作食堂。如今它早已淹没在四周成百幢新建的农庄房舍之中了。契霍夫斯基告诉我们，这个农庄的四百多户庄员现在分住在两个居民村里，大部都是新住宅。
    接着我们又参观了几处宽大的猪舍和牛舍，这里养着肥大的高加索种猪和各种奶牛。这个农庄共有一千三百多头牛、三千多只羊、一百多匹马、一千八百多只猪、二万三千只鸡鸭，还有二百一十只火鸡。目前庄员们正在努力提高牛奶和肉类的产量，响应“赶上美国”的号召。
    斯大林农庄现在除了农业和畜牧业外，还有机器修理厂、砖瓦厂、面粉厂、面包厂、香肠加工工厂、黄油加工工厂、酿酒厂和电力站等。我们参观酿酒厂的时候，庄员们正在把一箱箱刚摘下来的葡萄运进厂里来，准备酿酒。
    从酿酒厂出来，契霍夫斯基领我们去参观农庄的田地。这里再不是野草丛生的荒原了。只见一片片几十公顷大小的田地上，四周围着高大而整齐的防风林。
    契霍夫斯基满心高兴地对我们说：“去年我们农庄每公顷冬小麦平均收二十一公担五十公斤，玉米收四十公担，水果收一百五十公斤，葡萄收一百三十公斤。今年我们又新种了一百二十公顷的果树呢。”
    只有一件事使这位主席烦恼：今年整个夏天没有下雨。可是，说也凑巧，在我们从田里返回村庄的路上，忽然浓云密布，淅淅沥沥地下起雨来。
    黄昏的时候，我们在雨中访问了两个庄员的家庭。
    安娜一家五口人，住着一座六十平方公尺大小的房子，这是前年重修的。安娜在农庄食堂工作，丈夫在田间工作。去年他们一共有一千二百个劳动日的收入，她还用二十个劳动日的收入买了一个带镜子的衣橱呢。
    赛尼娅一家生活也很好。她一家五口人，住得比安娜家里还宽敞些。她在牛舍工作，丈夫是农庄的建筑工人，女儿在田间工作。他们每月收入约有一千七百卢布。去年她花了一千五百卢布给儿子做了一套新西服，花了一千二百卢布给丈夫做了一件新大衣，每人又各买了一双新皮鞋……。
    “还买了些什么？”我们问。
    “连我自己也记不清了。”赛尼娅笑着回答，“还准备买小汽车，钱都准备好了，就是还得等一段时间。”
    是的，劳动日收入多了，庄员们的购买力也提高了。契霍夫斯基告诉我们，去年这个农庄每个劳动日平均可以得到三公斤七百公分粮食、一公斤牛奶、三百公分土豆、一百五十公分酒、八十公分肉、一公斤蔬菜、三百公分向日葵、三十公分油、二百公分水果，还有七卢布三十五戈比的钱，折合起来共有三十几个卢布。今年将增加到四十个卢布。而1949年这个农庄劳动日的平均收入才有九个卢布，那时除了有半公斤粮食以外，牛奶、猪肉、蔬菜、水果等等全都没有。
    中午和晚上我们都是在宽敞洁净的农庄食堂吃饭的。农庄有两个公共食堂，差不多所有的庄员都在食堂吃饭。安娜对我们说，她一家三口在食堂吃饭，每天两顿，一共才花五六个卢布，既方便又便宜。这种食堂在苏联集体农庄里还是少有的。
    除了公共食堂以外，农庄里还有一所中学，有疗养院和运动场、幼儿园和托儿所，还有公园和俱乐部。庄员们每星期可以在俱乐部里看三四次电影。
    晚饭后，在农庄主席办公室里休息的时候，在闲谈中，我们知道他是雇农的儿子，1921年就入了党，因为他在公社成绩很好，被送到齐姆良斯基农业学校学习。1935年毕业后，就在公社里工作。卫国战争时期他参加了军队。战后他在区里工作一个时期，又回到农庄来，现在他在这里已经当了九年的农庄主席了。他亲眼看到这个农庄整个成长的过程，他自己也是随着农庄的成长而成长起来的。
    三十五年以前，一群辛勤的“播种者”在这片荒芜的草原上播下的种子，今天不仅已经开花结实，而且获得了丰收。这里的荒原已经变成了良田，穷困已经变成了富裕，昔日的贫农已经变成了今天的共产主义建设者。在社会主义时代里，苏联的农村和农民的生活起了多么巨大的变化啊！
