People's Daily Moscow, October 30th Dispatch: As people around the world warmly celebrate the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution, and as the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station surpasses the Grand Coulee Dam in the United States in generating capacity, becoming the world's largest completed hydroelectric station, Comrade Pavlenko, the Soviet Minister of Power Stations, received reporters and answered their questions in detail.

Question: What is the current status of the construction of large hydroelectric stations in the Soviet Union?

Answer: The Soviet Union possesses enormous hydroelectric resources. The most effective portion of these resources, mainly those suitable for large hydroelectric stations, is estimated at 1.2 trillion kilowatt-hours. Therefore, the Soviet Union pays great attention to the construction of large hydroelectric stations.

The construction of hydroelectric stations can save large amounts of fuel, reduce labor consumption in electricity production, and obtain cheaper electricity. In 1956, the cost of hydroelectric power was four-fifths lower than that of thermal power plants.

During the construction of hydroelectric stations, other national economic problems can be solved comprehensively, such as river transport, irrigation of arid land, flood control, and water supply for industrial areas.

The Soviet Union has built and completed many large hydroelectric stations.

Before the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution, the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station reached its designed total capacity of 2.1 million kilowatts. This is the world's largest hydroelectric station. It will generate an average of 10.8 billion kilowatt-hours per year. The Kuibyshev water control project, including a 700-meter-long and 80-meter-high reinforced concrete hydroelectric station building, a 2,800-meter-long earth dam, a 981-meter-long spillway dam with 38 openings capable of discharging 40,000 cubic meters of water per second, two navigation locks, canals, etc., was built in an unprecedentedly short period in the history of world water conservancy engineering. The huge Kuibyshev water control project was built on sandy and muddy soil under complex geological conditions, proving that Soviet designers and builders bravely solved the most complex engineering problems in water conservancy construction. Adopting a new method of simultaneous construction and installation, twenty 105,000-kilowatt hydraulic generators were installed in a very short period of less than two years. The electricity from the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station is transmitted to the central industrial area and the Volga River basin through 400-kilovolt power lines. The overhead line from the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station through the oil-producing areas of the Bashkir and Tatar Autonomous Republics to the Urals will soon be completed.

Another large hydroelectric station on the Volga River is the Stalingrad Hydroelectric Station with a generating capacity of 2.31 million kilowatts. The construction of the Stalingrad Hydroelectric Station is progressing very smoothly. Concrete pouring is now being carried out extensively there, and the installation of the first batch of generators has begun. It is expected that the Volga River will be dammed at the gate in the autumn of 1958, and two generators will generate electricity by the end of next year.

The Kremenchug Hydroelectric Station is being built on the Dnieper River, with a generating capacity of 450,000 kilowatts. The reservoir of this hydroelectric station has a volume of 9 billion cubic meters, which can regulate the water flow of the hydroelectric stations on the Dnieper River downstream from it, especially to increase the power generation of the Dnieper Hydroelectric Station by 540 million kilowatt-hours. Auxiliary enterprises and workers' residential areas have been built on the construction site of this hydroelectric station, and concrete pouring has begun on the dam. The construction workers there are striving to put the first batch of generators into operation in 1959, one year ahead of schedule.

The Irkutsk Hydroelectric Station, with a generating capacity of 660,000 kilowatts and an annual power generation of more than 4 billion kilowatt-hours, will now be built on the Angara River. This hydroelectric station uses Lake Baikal as a reservoir to regulate water flow, so it generates electricity very evenly throughout the year. The electricity from the Irkutsk Hydroelectric Station is sent to the power system of the largest industrial area in eastern Siberia, the Irkutsk-Cheremkhovo industrial area.

Construction of the second hydroelectric station on the Angara River, the Bratsk Hydroelectric Station with a generating capacity of 3.6 million kilowatts, which can generate 22 billion kilowatt-hours a year, which is about the sum of the power generation of the Kuibyshev and Stalingrad hydroelectric stations, has begun. In the past two years, preparatory work has been completed on this construction site, dozens of kilometers of roads and railways have been laid, and residential areas for construction workers and future exploration personnel have appeared; on the construction site of the basic project, weirs have been built, foundation pits have been dug, and concrete dam construction has begun. The first batch of generators of this hydroelectric station may generate electricity in 1961.

Construction of the Krasnoyarsk Hydroelectric Station with a generating capacity of 4 million kilowatts and an annual power generation of 19 billion kilowatt-hours has begun on the Yenisei River. The Krasnoyarsk water control project will include a concrete dam and hydroelectric station building more than one kilometer long and 120 meters high, in which 14 generators with a generating capacity of 286,000 kilowatts each will be placed. A reservoir with a volume of 77 billion cubic meters will be formed in front of the dam. Construction work has now begun. The construction of the Krasnoyarsk Hydroelectric Station is expected to take seven years. When this hydroelectric station is connected to the Bratsk Hydroelectric Station, it will lay the foundation for the super-unified power system of eastern and western Siberia, with a total power of 50 million kilowatts.

The Novosibirsk Hydroelectric Station, with a generating capacity of 400,000 kilowatts and an annual power generation of 1.7 billion kilowatt-hours, is being built on the Ob River. The first two generators of this hydroelectric station will generate electricity this year. The navigation equipment there has already been put into use. The electricity from this hydroelectric station will be sent to the power system of the Novosibirsk industrial area for industrial use and the electrification of the Siberian Railway.

In order to supply electricity to the non-ferrous metal smelting enterprises in Kazakhstan, a series of hydroelectric stations are being built on the Ertis River. The first one is the Shulginsk Hydroelectric Station, where three generators have already been put into operation, generating a total of 250,000 kilowatts.

The existence of cheap electricity production and abundant raw material resources has enabled the establishment of huge enterprises in western and eastern Siberia and Kazakhstan for the production of aluminum, manganese, titanium, ferroalloys and electrometallurgy, synthetic rubber, and other important sectors of the national economy.

Question: What is the current status of the construction of large thermal power plants in the Soviet Union?

Answer: During the first few five-year plans (1929-1940), the generating capacity of various power systems was not large, and the local thermal power plants built only had a generating capacity of 200,000 to 250,000 kilowatts, with each turbine generating 25,000 to 50,000 kilowatts. Under the new conditions of the huge scale of power development, it is more economically advantageous to build large thermal power plants with a generating capacity of 600,000, 1 million to 1.2 million kilowatts, with each turbine generating 100,000, 150,000 to 200,000 kilowatts, and boiler evaporation capacity is also very large.

The Sixth Five-Year Plan stipulates the construction of a series of large thermal power plants with a generating capacity of more than 1.2 million kilowatts, some of which have already generated electricity. The Dnieper River Bank Thermal Power Plant already has four generators, each with 100,000 kilowatts, generating electricity, and the fifth will also generate electricity by the end of the year. Six generators, each with 100,000 kilowatts, have been installed at the South Ural Thermal Power Plant, and two generators, each with 200,000 kilowatts, will be installed in the future. The first 200,000-kilowatt steam turbine produced by a Soviet factory this year will be installed at this thermal power plant.

The Sixth Five-Year Plan also stipulates the construction of a series of thermal power plants with a generating capacity of 500,000 or 600,000 kilowatts. Some of them have already generated electricity.

As a rule, all these large local thermal power plants are distributed in fuel-producing areas, which saves railway transportation.

Due to the advancement of construction and installation methods, the construction speed of large power plants is very fast. After the war, special attention was paid to the use of prefabricated components and structures, turning construction into installation. Reinforced concrete components used in the construction of thermal power plants before the war only accounted for 10% of all reinforced concrete work, while now they account for 45% to 50%.

Question: What is the role of electrification in the lives of the Soviet people and its development prospects?

Answer: The role of electrification in the Soviet Union's economic, political, and cultural construction is immeasurable. As everyone knows, since the October Revolution, the Soviet Union's total industrial output has increased 32 times. This growth is the result of the Soviet Union's successful implementation of Lenin's National Electrification Plan. Electrification is the foundation of the socialist transformation of industry, especially heavy industry. Pre-revolutionary Russia ranked at the bottom of the world in electricity production, and now the Soviet Union ranks second in the world in electricity production. The growth of electricity production in the Soviet Union is now maintaining a speed that exceeds that of the most developed capitalist countries.

80% of electricity is used in industry. Electricity consumption in industry is increasing day by day. The electricity used by each industrial worker in production has increased by 1.3 times compared with 1940. Mainly due to electrification, the labor productivity of industrial workers in 1957 increased by two times compared with 1913 and by 1.1 times compared with 1940. This is the great significance of electrification in improving labor productivity, and the improvement of labor productivity, in the final analysis, is the most important condition for the victory of communism.

When talking about the electrification of industry, it must be pointed out that electrification has played a huge role in the development of industrial sectors such as aluminum, ferroalloys, abrasives, calcium carbide, and high-grade steel that did not exist before the revolution. All technological progress in the Soviet national economy is directly and indirectly related to electrification.

Soviet electrification is characterized by the widespread development of electricity in all federated republics, which fully conforms to the Communist Party's national policy. In some republics that were considered backward border areas before the revolution, power generation has increased hundreds of times compared with before the revolution.

The electrification of railways has great national economic significance. Because it can increase the traffic capacity of railways by half to one time, save half to two-thirds of fuel, and reduce transportation costs. Nearly 7,000 kilometers of railways have now been electrified, and further electrification of the Siberian Railway and other trunk lines is being widely carried out. In the near future, the "Moscow-Beijing" train will be electrified from Moscow to Irkutsk, and the train speed will be greatly increased.

Electrification has opened up the broadest prospects for improving people's lives. Large residential areas have now become accustomed to using electric lights and electric stoves. Electrification has created convenient conditions for cultural rest. Radio broadcasting and television are becoming increasingly popular. The production of household electrical appliances continues to grow. The scale of heating equipment in Soviet cities ranks first in the world.

The prospects for the development of electrification are also very great. The Soviet Union has extremely rich electricity resources: hydropower, coal, oil, natural gas, and peat. The Soviet industry, which has no economic crisis, will continue to develop smoothly, and for this, new power stations with advanced technology - hydro, thermal, and atomic - will be built, as well as trunk and branch power grids.

Soon, we will begin to formulate the long-term plan for 1959 to 1965, which will stipulate the high-speed development of electricity.

The further development of electrification will help us strengthen the strength of the country, improve the living conditions of the people, and will help solve the basic economic task - surpassing the most developed capitalist countries in terms of industrial products and food per capita.

Now, we are particularly pleased that the People's Republic of China is about to complete its First Five-Year Plan and has achieved great success in electrification construction, increasing electricity production, and producing electrification equipment. Soviet power personnel are very happy to introduce the necessary technical assistance and work experience to our Chinese colleagues.

    苏联胜利执行国家电气化计划
    电力的增长速度超过任何资本主义国家
    苏联电站部部长巴甫连科答本报记者问
    本报莫斯科30日专电  在全世界人民热烈迎接十月革命四十周年的日子里，在古比雪夫水电站的发电量超过美国大库利水电站的发电量，而成为已经建成的世界最大的水电站的日子里，苏联电站部部长巴甫连科接见了记者，详尽地回答记者所提出的问题。
    问：苏联各个大水电站建设的现况如何？
    答：苏联拥有巨大的水电资源。这些资源的最有效的部分，主要是那些可以供大水电站用的，估计有一万二千亿度。因此，苏联很注意建设大水电站。
    水电站的建设，可以节约大量燃料，降低电力生产中劳动的消耗，和取得更便宜的电力。在1956年，水电站电力的成本比热电厂低五分之四。
    在建设水电站的时候，可以综合地解决其他国民经济问题，如河运、灌溉旱地、防止水灾、供应工业区的用水等。
    苏联建设和建成许多大水电站。
    在十月革命四十周年之前，古比雪夫水电站达到设计的全部能力——发电二百一十万瓩。这是世界上最大的水电站。它一年平均将产电一百零八亿度。古比雪夫水利枢纽，包括七百公尺长和八十公尺高的钢筋混凝土的水电站建筑物，二千八百公尺长的土堤，九百八十一公尺长、有三十八道孔、能够每秒流水四万立方公尺的溢水坝，两座航运水闸，运河等等，在世界水利工程建筑史上空前短的期间建成了。巨大的古比雪夫水利枢纽是在复杂的地质条件下，在沙土和泥土上建立的，这证明苏联设计师和建筑者勇敢地解决了水利建筑方面最复杂的工程问题。采用了建筑和安装同时进行的新方法，在不到两年的非常短的期间安装了每部十万零五千瓩的水力发电机二十部。古比雪夫水电站的电力，经过四百千伏的电线，输送给中部工业区和伏尔加河流域。最近将完成从古比雪夫水电站经过巴什基尔和鞑靼自治共和国石油产区到乌拉尔的架线工作。
    在伏尔加河上的另一个大水电站是发电能力二百三十一万瓩的斯大林格勒水电站。斯大林格勒水电站的建筑发展得非常顺利。现在那里广泛地展开了混凝土浇灌工作并且开始安装第一批发电机。预计在1958年秋天将在闸门口拦断伏尔加河，明年年底将有两部发电机发电。
    在第聂伯河上建筑着克列门楚格水电站，它的发电能力是四十五万瓩。这个水电站的水库容积九十亿立方公尺，可以调节在它下游的第聂伯河上的各个水电站的水流，特别是将使第聂伯水电站的发电量增加五亿四千万度。在这个水电站的工地上已建成了辅助性企业、工人住区，已经开始向堤坝灌筑混凝土。那里的建筑工人努力争取提前一年，在1959年使第一批发电机发电。
    现在安加拉河上将建成伊尔库次克水电站，发电能力六十六万瓩，年产电四十多亿度。这个水电站利用贝加尔湖作为调节水流的水库，所以一年到头产电非常均衡。伊尔库次克水电站的电力被送到西伯利亚东部最大的伊尔库次克—切列姆霍沃工业区的电力系统中去。
    在安加拉河上开始建筑第二座水电站，发电力三百六十万瓩的布拉茨克水电站，一年能产电二百二十亿度，即约为古比雪夫和斯大林格勒两座水电站发电量的总和。两年来在这个工地上完成了准备工作，铺了几十公里公路和铁路，出现了建筑工人和未来勘查人员的住区；在基本工程的工地上，起了堰堤，开了基坑，开始灌筑混凝土堤坝。这个水电站的第一批发电机可能在1961年发电。
    在叶尼塞河上开始建设克拉斯诺雅尔斯克水电站，发电能力四百万瓩，一年产电一百九十亿度。克拉斯诺雅尔斯克水利枢纽将包括一百二十公尺高、一公里多长的混凝土堤坝和水电站建筑物，其中将安放每部发电能力为二十八万六千瓩的发电机十四部。在堤坝前将拦成容积七百七十亿立方公尺的水库。现在建筑工作已经展开。克拉斯诺雅尔斯克水电站的建筑，预期七年。这个水电站和布拉次克水电站联接起来，将打下西伯利亚东部和西部超级统一电力系统的基础，这个电力系统总电力将达五千万瓩。
    在鄂毕河上建筑着新西伯利亚水电站，发电能力四十万瓩，一年产电十七亿度。今年这个水电站的头两部发电机将发电。那里的通航设备已经动用。这个水电站的电力将送到新西伯利亚工业区的电力系统，以供给工业和西伯利亚铁路的电气化之用。
    为了供给哈萨克斯坦有色金属冶炼企业电力，在额尔齐斯河上建筑着一连串水电站。第一座是石山口水电站，那里已经有三部发电机开动，共发电二十五万瓩。
    便宜的电力生产和丰富的原料资源的存在，使得在西伯利亚东西部和哈萨克斯坦建立起生产铝、锰、钛、铁合金和电气冶金、合成橡胶等等巨大企业和国民经济其他重要部门。
    问：苏联各大火电厂建设的现况如何？
    答：在头几个五年计划时期（1929—1940年），各个电力系统的发电能力不大，建成的地方火电厂只拥有二十万到二十五万瓩发电能力，每部涡轮机发电能力二万五千到五万瓩。在电力发展到巨大规模的新条件下，建设大火电厂在经济上更为有利，这类大火电厂拥有六十万、一百万到一百二十万瓩发电能力，每部涡轮机发电力为十万、十五万到二十万瓩，锅炉蒸发容量也非常大。
    第六个五年计划规定建设一系列发电力在一百二十万瓩以上的大火电厂，其中有些已经发电。第聂伯河岸火电厂已经有每部十万瓩的发电机四部发电，到年底第五部也将发电。在南乌拉尔火电厂已经装置每部十万瓩的发电机六部，今后将装置每部二十万瓩的发电机两部。今年苏联工厂出产的第一部二十万瓩蒸汽发电机将装置在这个火电厂。
    第六个五年计划也规定建设一系列发电能力在五、六十万瓩的火电厂。其中有些已经发电。
    照例，所有这些大的地方火电厂都是分布在燃料产区，这节省了铁路运输。
    由于建筑和安装方法的进步，大电厂建设的速度都很快。战后特别注意利用预制的构件和结构，把建筑变为安装。战前在建筑火电厂时利用的钢筋混凝土构件只占全部钢筋混凝土工的10％，而现在占45％到50％。
    问：电气化在苏联人民生活中的作用和它发展的远景如何？
    答：电气化在苏联经济、政治和文化的建设中的作用，是难以估量的。大家都知道，苏联在十月革命以来，工业总产量增长了三十二倍。这个增长是苏联成功地实现列宁的国家电气化计划的结果。电气化是工业，首先是重工业社会主义改造的基础。革命前俄国电力生产居世界末几位，现在苏联电力生产占世界第二位。现在苏联电力生产的增长，保持着超过最发达的资本主义国家的速度。
    80％电力用在工业上。工业用电日益增长。每个工业工人在生产中使用的电力，比1940年增加了一点三倍。主要由于电气化，工业工人劳动生产率在1957年比1913年提高了两倍，比1940年提高了一点一倍。这就是电气化对于提高劳动生产率的巨大意义，而劳动生产率的提高，归根结蒂，是共产主义胜利的最主要条件。
    在谈到工业的电气化时候，必须指出，电气化在发展铝，铁合金，磨料，电石，以及革命前没有的高级钢等工业部门中，都起了巨大作用。苏联国民经济中的一切技术进步，都和电气化有直接和间接的联系。
    苏联电气化是以在所有加盟共和国广泛发展电力为特点的，这完全符合共产党的民族政策。在一些革命前被认为落后的边疆的共和国里，发电量比革命前增加几百倍。
    铁路的电气化具有巨大的国民经济意义。因为它能把铁路的通行力提高半倍到一倍，节省燃料一半到三分之二，并且降低运输成本。现在已经有将近七千公里铁路电气化，正在广泛地展开西伯利亚铁路和其他干线的进一步电气化的工作。不久的将来，“莫斯科—北京”列车从莫斯科到伊尔库次克这一路程将电气化，火车速度将大大提高。
    电气化为改善人民生活打开了最广阔的远景。现在的大居民区已经习惯于使用电灯、电炉。电气化为文化休息创造了便利条件。无线电广播、电视日益普遍。家庭电气用具的生产继续增长。苏联城市的暖气设备的规模，占世界第一位。
    电气化发展的远景也很大。苏联拥有极丰富的电力资源：水力、煤、石油、天然气、泥炭。没有经济危机的苏联工业将继续顺利地发展，而为此将建设有先进技术的新电力站——水力的、火力的和原子能的，也将建设干线和支线电力网。
    不久，我们将着手编制1959年到1965年的远景计划，内中将规定高速发展电力。
    电气化的进一步发展，将帮助我们加强国家的力量，改进人民的生活条件，并且将帮助解决基本的经济任务——在按人口计算工业品和食品方面超过最发达的资本主义国家。
    现在，我们特别高兴的是：中华人民共和国即将完成第一个五年计划，在电气化建设，提高电力生产，生产电气化设备上，取得了巨大的成就。苏联电力人员非常乐于把必要的技术援助和工作经验介绍给我们的中国同业。
