    Longxi Pineapple Pomelos
    The Longxi Special District in Fujian Province, known for its abundant pineapples and pomelos, has experienced a bumper fruit harvest this year. Preliminary estimates indicate that the total pineapple production in Longxi County reached over 1.21 million catties, more than double last year's output. The Wendan pomelos and Pingshan pomelos in this special district have already begun to be harvested. The procurement of Wendan and Pingshan varieties alone is expected to exceed 1.8 million pieces, an increase of 5.5% compared to last year. This year's pomelos are large, some weighing more than one catty each, and are currently being transported to Shanghai, Hangzhou, Beijing, Tianjin, and other places via the Yingxia Railway.
