Ode to October

　　Embraces in Song Between China and the Soviet Union
　　Tian Han
    In the late spring of this year, Chairman Voroshilov was invited to visit New China. Chairman Mao embraced Chairman Voroshilov amidst a welcoming crowd of millions, symbolizing the eternal and unbreakable friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union. The Chinese people affectionately call Chairman Voroshilov "Old Voroshilov" out of utmost respect. This state guest visited various parts of China, both north and south, and also participated in the May 1st International Labor Day celebrations, receiving a warm welcome from the people of our country. I wrote a long poem of one hundred and eight verses in pentameter to record this grand event. Since the rectification and airing of views, right-wing elements have published many anti-Soviet fallacies, which have been severely refuted by the people of the whole country. This year marks the 40th anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution, and following the successful Soviet tests of intercontinental ballistic missiles and artificial earth satellites, the Chinese people will warmly celebrate the October Revolution to encourage themselves to learn from the Soviet experience and the spirit of building the country through diligence and frugality, and to consolidate the unity of the peaceful, democratic, and socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. The Chinese revolution is a continuation of the great October Revolution, and the great unity of the people of China and the Soviet Union is the guarantee of world peace and human progress. This poem can also be regarded as a hymn to the October Revolution, and I hope it will contribute to the fraternal unity of the people of China and the Soviet Union.
　　Is Old Voroshilov not old?, Is Zedong truly Zedong,
　　The red flag is raised, fluttering, the silver wings arrive with a roar;
　　The joyous colors compete with the sun, the cheers are like thunder;
　　The two giants of China and the Soviet Union, embrace tightly in the midst of hundreds of millions,
　　Clearly brothers, forever of one heart and mind!
　　Lenin created a great cause, suffering internal and external attacks,
　　Defending Tsaritsyn, the general achieved great merit.
　　The sound of war drums is heard in the east, wolf smoke rises on the western border,
　　After hundreds of battles, his hair is like snow, finally making the fortress strong.
　　China for a hundred years, has accumulated troubles into a malignant sore,
　　Warlords compete for cities and land, the great powers bully the exhausted and weak,
　　The nation's situation is precarious, patriots are worried and anxious;
　　The guns of the October Revolution rang out, thus opening the Eastern ignorance.
　　Our party was born at the beginning, a strong cry startling the blind,
　　The Beijing-Hankou Railway becomes a line of blood, the Hong Kong-Guangdong strike makes it ice-sealed;
　　The Northern Expedition becomes the division of Han, the Southern Expedition congratulates He and Ye who were loyal;
　　The towering Jinggang Mountain, soldiers gather like clouds,
　　Cultivating the land and dividing it among the poor, the Red Army abolishes hiring;
　　Indeed, a spark of fire, starts a prairie fire, shining brightly!
　　The Soviet area opposes the encirclement and suppression, frustrating Chiang Kai-shek's edge four times,
　　But alas, committing dogmatism, forced to abandon Gao and Feng.
　　Twenty-five thousand li, the Long March through the silkworm bush.
　　After the Zunyi Conference, the leadership respects Mao,
　　Turning the tide of victory and defeat, unpredictable like a swimming dragon!
　　Snow mountains imprint footprints, grasslands leave hoof prints;
　　The Dadu iron chain is cold, the Lazikou bird path is passable;
　　Thirsty, drinking warhorse blood, hungry, eating roadside weeds;
　　How many soldiers' souls, smile as they listen to the cricket's chirping.
　　The great army arrives at the Yan River, the winter of 1935,
　　In rags, opening up the mountains and forests, repeatedly rectifying the party's style;
　　Raising the Luyang spear high, pulling back the Hou Yi bow;
　　Pingxingguan becomes the tomb of the invaders, Huaihai becomes the enemy's cage;
　　Large and small, experiencing hundreds of battles, thoroughly eliminating the three evils,
　　Thus making the five-star flag, shine brightly on the lofty city wall.
　　Although the revolution has been learned, construction is still ignorant,
　　The fraternal Soviet Union, teaches me tirelessly,
　　Experience is enough to absorb, technology is provided:
　　The northern Anshan refines iron, the southern Huize smelts copper;
　　Yumen's oil veins are rich, Pingdingshan's coal sea is abundant;
　　The Yellow River throws a giant whip, the Yangtze River lies a long rainbow;
　　In just seven or eight years, the motherland's appearance has been changed.
　　The land reform ends the bitter roots, agricultural collectivization is complete,
　　Transforming capitalists, turning meat-eaters into laborers.
　　Liberating productive forces, like breaking a huge flood,
　　What is New China like? The Eastern fiery clouds bake!
　　The small Uncle Sam, resents my strength,
　　Using the United Nations as a pretext, the momentum is particularly fierce;
　　The Yalu River hears the sound of cannons, Taiwan and Penghu gather warships,
　　Atomic blackmail is difficult, bacteria are dropped like flies and bees.
　　Annihilating the enemy on Shangganling, the war blood congeals into red maple;
　　Signing the treaty at Panmunjom, the enemy's wounds are temporarily stitched.
　　The Vietnamese-French war is over, Asia and Africa are reconciled again,
　　The surging Suez, still flows murmuring,
　　War I am not afraid, peace is what I admire,
　　Removing the grudges of Soviet-Yugoslavia, stopping the countercurrent in Hungary,
　　Uniting our camp, not allowing a breach to be made,
　　The Soviet Union and China, are as vigilant as the morning bell.
　　Beijing celebrates May Day, a good day that is truly rare to meet.
　　The towering Tiananmen, ten thousand heads look up at the two elders.
　　Colorful balls rise above the sea of people, white doves soar in the clear sky,
　　Men have broad tiger arms, women have wavy hair;
　　Children wear red scarves, old men support green bamboo canes;
　　Workers raise steel production high, farmers shoulder lush cauliflower;
　　Students paint their mentors, white hair and disheveled beard.
　　Professors watch from the rostrum, contentedly whispering to each other,
　　Wishing to serve the people, with all their wisdom and intelligence;
　　Only a few people, drill into dead ends.
　　The literary and artistic army comes, their rainbow skirts step gracefully,
　　Five dragons play with a red pearl, nine lions roll green manes;
　　Giant stars shoot colorful threads, hundreds of plays walk on brocade curtains.
　　Moreover, the sports team, its lineup is so lush,
　　Everyone's waist and legs are strong, each one's muscles are abundant.
　　Colorful flags move hunting, golden drums beat loudly.
　　After the meeting, the tide of people surges, all streams return to the source,
　　Looking up at Tiananmen, the cheers vibrate deafeningly.
　　The Chairman and the guests, their faces full of spring light,
　　Taking the lead towards the masses, waving hats warmly and respectfully.
　　Fireworks crackle, crimson nitrate congeals into rainbows.
　　That night, welcoming Old Voroshilov, the jade palace is covered with golden velvet;
　　What to drink to the guest? Luminous cups of fine wine;
　　What to offer to the guest? Picking hibiscus from the river;
　　The wine is green for heroes, the flowers add red for the elders!
　　The old man repeats his speech, his bold spirit shines in his eyes,
　　Each cup wishes for peace, each word comes from sincerity:
　　"Do not allow the aggressors, to start military campaigns again;
　　Do not allow hundreds of millions of people, to easily become sand worms."
　　The old man walks very briskly, using his cane to climb Juyongguan,
　　Looking up at the Great Wall, winding into the sky.
　　When to go with the old man, to exhaust the mountains and seas:
　　West Lake's waves are rippling, the Qinhuai River's moon is hazy;
　　Three rivers converge into the Pearl River, thousands of sails pass through Wusong,
　　Climbing the back of the azure dragon in the west, ascending the peak of the father-in-law in the east;
　　Visiting Heng Mountain in Hunan, climbing Mount Song in Central Plains;
　　Emei arrays cold firs, Huangshan coils strange pines;
　　Yangzhou's lake is thin and damaged, Jingkou's mountain is exquisite;
　　The Li River is fragrant with osmanthus, Guangzhou is lush with kapok trees;
　　Luoyang is full of peonies, Changsha falls migrating geese;
　　Dai Temple's ancient cypresses, Hengcheng's lush parasol trees;
　　Xiaotun accumulates oracle bones, Yangshao picks up pottery tubes;
　　The poet is drunk in Chang'an, the concubine bathes in Lintong;
　　Newly arrived at the Feng River, discovering King Mu's horse.
　　It is a pity that the old man star, comes and goes so quickly,
　　After visiting Southeast Asia, he bids farewell to Xinhua Palace,
　　Ten thousand cars drive to see him off, the red sun is still glowing,
　　Waving goodbye, mountains and clouds are thousands of layers.
　　Willing to express my deep feelings to the entire Soviet Union;
　　Willing to cherish the hundred-year-old body for the sake of all mankind,
　　Working hard without slackening, personally witnessing the Great Harmony!

Note: Comrade Xia Yan once used "Old Voroshilov is not old" as an antithetical couplet, Chinese people consider a person old but still ambitious as "not submitting to old age".
    Tsaritsyn is today's Stalingrad. On August 18, 1918, Tsaritsyn was surrounded on three sides by Krasnov's army, endangering Moscow's food supply. Old Voroshilov and Stalin successfully completed this defense task. A. Tolstoy's "Defense of Tsaritsyn" describes this battle.
    Refers to the February 7th Great Strike on the Beijing-Hankou Railway, martyrs such as Shi Yang struggled unyieldingly against the warlord Wu Peifu and were killed.
    Hong Kong-Guangdong General Strike.
    Gao and Feng, the capital of the Zhou Dynasty, King Ping was restrained by foreign tribes and moved east to Luoyang.
    The three evils refer to imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism.
    The Yellow River built dams such as the Sanmenxia and Liujiaxia dams. The ancients said "throwing a whip can cut off the flow".
    The Yangtze River Bridge is like a long rainbow lying on the waves.
    "Uncle Sam" refers to the United States.
    Refers to the Beijing Hotel.
    A brick and tile factory site in Lidong, Xi'an, discovered a chariot and horse pit from the Western Zhou Dynasty during construction. Two horse heads are decorated with shells, and four horse heads are decorated with bronze rings, etc., the horse heads still raise unyieldingly.

专栏：十月颂歌

　　歌中苏拥抱
　　田汉
    今年春暮，伏罗希洛夫主席应邀来访新中国，毛主席在百万欢迎群众中与伏罗希洛夫主席拥抱，象征了中苏两国人民永恒的、牢不可破的友谊。中国人民以无比的敬爱之情称伏罗希洛夫主席为“伏老”而不名。这位国宾在我南北各地参观后，又参加了五一国际劳动节，备受我国人民热烈欢迎。我曾写成五言长歌一百零八韵，纪录这一盛事。整风鸣放以来，右派分子发表了许多反苏谬论，已经全国人民予以严厉驳斥。今年正值十月社会主义革命四十周年，又正在苏联成功地试验了洲际弹道导弹和人造地球卫星之后，中国人民为了鼓舞自己学习苏联经验，和勤俭建国的精神，为了巩固以苏联为首的和平、民主、社会主义阵营的团结，将热烈庆祝十月革命。中国革命是伟大十月革命的继续，中苏两国人民的伟大团结是世界和平与人类进步的保障。这首诗也可以当作对十月革命的赞歌，并希望它有助于中苏两国人民的兄弟团结。
　　伏老不伏老?，泽东真泽东，
　　红旗举飘飘，银翼来隆隆；
　　喜色争日丽，欢声如雷洪；
　　中苏两巨人，紧抱亿众中，
　　分明兄弟俩，永远同心胸！
　　列宁创伟业，备受内外攻，
　　保卫察里津?，将军著丰功。
　　东部闻鼙鼓，西陲举狼烽，
　　百战发如雪，终使堡垒雄。
　　中国百年来，积患成疽痈，
　　军阀争城地，列强欺疲癃，
　　民族势岌岌，志士忧忡忡；
　　十月大炮响，遂启东方蒙。
　　我党出世初，壮啼惊瞽蒙，
　　京汉成血线?，省港使冰封?；
　　北伐成汉分，南征贺叶忠；
　　巍巍井岗山，战士如云从，
　　耕地分中贫，红军废雇佣：
　　果然星星火，燎原光熊熊！
　　苏区反围剿，四挫蒋贼锋，
　　奈何犯教条，被迫弃镐酆?。
　　二万五千里，长征历蚕丛。
　　遵义会议后，领导尊毛公，
　　扭转胜败机，不测如游龙！
　　雪山印足迹，草地留蹄踪；
　　大渡铁索寒，腊子鸟道通；
　　渴饮战马血，饥餐驿路蓬；
　　多少战士魂，含笑听吟蛩。
　　大军抵延水，一九三五冬，
　　褴褛启山林，反复整党风；
　　高挥鲁阳戈，力挽后羿弓；
　　平型成寇墓，淮海作敌笼；
　　大小经百战，彻底除三凶?，
　　遂使五星旗，灿烂升崇墉。
　　革命虽学会，建设尚懵懵，
　　苏联兄弟邦，教我无倦慵，
　　经验足吸取，技术相提供：
　　北炼鞍山铁，南冶会泽铜；
　　玉门油脉富，平顶煤海丰；
　　黄河投巨鞭?，大江卧长虹?；
　　短短七八年，一改祖国容。
　　土改苦根尽，合作化全农，
　　改造资本家，肉食成劳工。
　　解放生产力，如决巨浸壅，
　　新中国何如？东方火云烘！
　　小哉山姆叔?，忌我实力充，
　　假借联合国，来势殊汹汹；
　　鸭绿闻炮声，台澎聚艨艟，
　　原子讹诈难，细菌投蝇蜂。
　　歼敌上甘岭，战血凝丹枫；
　　签约板门店，敌伤暂得缝。
　　越法既息争，亚非复和融，
　　澎湃苏彝士，依旧流淙淙，
　　战争我不惧，和平良所崇，
　　芥蒂消苏南，逆流止波匈，
　　团结我阵营，不令缺口冲，
　　苏联与中国，清警如晨钟。
　　北京庆五一，佳日真难逢。
　　峨峨天安门，万头仰两翁。
　　彩球上人海，白鸽翔晴空，
　　男人虎臂阔，女子波发松；
　　童耀红领巾，叟扶青竹筇；
　　工举钢产高，农肩菜花穠；
　　学生绘导师，皓首须鬔鬔。
　　教授观礼台，得意相喁喁，
　　共愿为人民，竭尽智与聪；
　　只有少数人，钻入死胡同。
　　文艺大军来，霓裳步瑽瑢，
　　五龙戏红珠，九狮滚绿鬃；
　　巨星射彩线，百戏走锦幪。
　　更有体育队，阵容何葱茏，
　　人人腰腿健，个个肌肉丰。
　　彩旗猎猎移，金鼓敲咚咚。
　　会毕人潮涌，万流尽朝宗，
　　仰望天安门，欢呼振耳聋。
　　主席与嘉宾，满面春光溶，
　　领头向群众，挥帽温且恭。
　　火花响毕剥，绛硝凝蝃蝀。
　　是夜迎伏老，玉殿铺金茸?；
　　何以饮嘉宾？美酒夜光盅；
　　何以献嘉宾？涉江采芙蓉；
　　酒为英雄绿，花添寿者红！
　　老人重致词，豪情耀双瞳，
　　杯杯祝和平，语语出诚衷：
　　“不使侵略者，再得兴兵戎；
　　不使亿万人，等闲成沙虫。”
　　老人极健步，策仗登居庸，
　　抬眼望长城，蜿蜒接苍穹。
　　何当与老人，直把山海穷：
　　西湖波滟潋，秦淮月朦胧；
　　三水汇珠江，千帆过吴淞，
　　西上苍龙背，东登丈人峰；
　　湖南访衡岳，中州攀碧嵩；
　　峨眉阵冷杉，黄山盘奇松；
　　扬州湖瘦损，京口山玲珑；
　　漓江馥八桂，羊城郁六榕；
　　洛阳盛牡丹，长沙落征鸿；
　　岱庙虬汉柏，衡城茂梧桐；
　　小屯积甲骨，仰韶拾陶筒；
　　诗人醉长安，妃子浴临潼；
　　新来沣水畔，发现穆王骢?。
　　所惜老人星，来去何匆匆，
　　访毕东南亚，旋辞新华宫，
　　万车走相送，红日犹曈曈，
　　挥手一为别，云山万千重。
　　愿向全苏联，致我情意浓；
　　愿为全人类，珍重百岁躬，
　　努力各不懈，亲眼见大同！
