Xinhua News Agency, 1st – Amidst the strains of "Ode to the Motherland," half a million people in the capital began the National Day parade.

    The honor guard carried huge banners proclaiming: "Long Live the Chinese Communist Party," "Welcome the Second Five-Year Plan," "Work Hard, Build the Nation Through Thrift," "Carry the Anti-Rightist Struggle Through to the End, Continue to Develop the All-People Rectification Movement," and "Liberate Taiwan."

    A wave of drumbeats came from the east side of the square, and 10,000 Young Pioneers marched to Tiananmen. Numerous doves and balloons flew into the sky from the children's hands.

    The marchers were arranged in ninety-four columns, advancing shoulder to shoulder. Beijing workers, who had already overfulfilled the First Five-Year Plan, carried five four-meter-long charts, marking the various achievements of our socialist industrial construction.

    As the workers' contingent reached Tiananmen, the reviewing stand immediately became animated. Party and state leaders and many distinguished guests continuously waved to the advancing workers.

    One hundred thousand workers, holding national flags and Communist Party flags, waving red and yellow bouquets, carrying various models, banners, and charts of completed and exceeded production plans, almost obscured the workers' ranks. Cries of "Long Live Chairman Mao!" and "Long Live the Chinese Communist Party!" resounded through the clouds. Mayor Peng Zhen shouted from the Tiananmen Gate tower, "Long Live the worker comrades!"

    In the contingent from the Beijing Qinghe Woolen Mill, Zhang Hengfu, who had returned to the workshop as a worker from his position as workshop director just two days prior, was particularly happy. He raised his arm, facing the Tiananmen Gate tower, and vigorously waved the bouquet in his hand. He wrote on the green leaves of that bouquet: "Chairman Mao: I returned to the workshop as a worker on the 28th. I used to be a workshop director. I am willing to work on the machines for a long time to build a socialist society as soon as possible."

    Leading the workers' parade contingents were veteran workers. Four "February 7th" veteran workers from the Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory, nearing sixty years of age, carried a banner reading "Long Live the Chinese Communist Party" and led the young workers across Tiananmen Square with renewed vigor.

    A stream of people appeared with models of trams and trolleybuses. Leading this contingent were eighteen veteran workers with twenty-two to thirty-four years of service. Veteran worker Chen Guolin said to his companions, "I feel like I'm getting younger the older I get." Zhang Zhenfang, an old tram driver who ate thin porridge almost all year round nine years ago, looked at the endless stream of joyful people and said excitedly, "The motherland changes every year. People are happier every year. I truly feel proud!"

    Today, the names of many new factories appeared in the workers' ranks. The North China Radio Equipment Factory is the youngest factory participating in today's parade. This factory will commence production after National Day.

    Suburban farmers carried models of various abundant crops. Among them were full-grained millet and sorghum, golden corn, and cotton with bursting bolls. Some farmers carried models of fat pigs and dairy cows. A huge chart showed that this year, farmers in the suburbs of Beijing supplied the city with 300 million more catties of vegetables than last year, and the number of pigs has increased more than threefold.

    Yang Qingshan, a 63-year-old poor peasant from the Xinghuo Agricultural Production Cooperative in the eastern suburbs, raised a five-jin sweet potato and cheered, "Long Live Chairman Mao!" As soon as his voice fell, Li Haifu, 67, raised a foot-long ear of corn and led the contingent in shouting, "Long Live the Chinese Communist Party!"

    Among the farmers' ranks was a notable group of "little farmers," recent junior high school graduates who participated in agricultural production during the summer vacation, determined to become the first generation of educated farmers in New China.

    A group of new farmers appeared in the farmers' contingent, cadres who responded to the call of the Party and the government to participate in manual labor in the countryside. Wang Yunxia, Wang Tengfang, and Lin Xueping, three female cadres who originally worked in the Nanyuan District People's Committee, chatted happily with the farmers before the parade. Wang Tengfang said:
  "Although we have not done much for this year's agricultural harvest in the suburbs, we feel a great honor today to be reviewed by Chairman Mao as a member of the victorious suburban farmers' contingent."

    The contingent of cadres from central and Beijing municipal organs carried charts and models of various indicators of China's completed First Five-Year Plan, resembling a mobile exhibition of China's great construction achievements. Many of them are activists in the anti-Rightist struggle.

    Scientists held high a large banner reading "Science Serves Socialism." The famous scientist Qian Sanqiang walked at the head of the contingent. He kept waving the bouquet in his hand towards Tiananmen and said excitedly that in the 1950 National Day parade, he saw only a few rows of the Academy of Sciences contingent from the viewing platform. In the 1952 National Day parade, the Academy of Sciences contingent he led had only 500 people, and this year the Academy of Sciences contingent is 1,500 people.

    The contingent of young students advanced, cheering and jumping. The banners made of flowers and the banners hanging from balloons all carried the same sentence: "Always Follow the Communist Party!" This contingent included newly admitted university students from worker and peasant backgrounds. In the new student contingent of the Transportation Department of the Beijing Railway Institute, Yang Maolin, the creator of the "Yang Maolin Advanced Loading Method" on the railway and a representative of the National People's Congress, was the most noticed. There were many old professors in the student ranks who were as enthusiastic and unrestrained as young people.

    Chairman Mao constantly waved to the parading people.

    The marchers continuously waved to Chairman Mao and the international friends on the reviewing stand, and cheered to the friends from Egypt and Syria. Khalil Khaled Abdul-Nour, the head of the Syrian student delegation, excitedly shouted in Chinese, "Long Live the Friendship Between the Chinese and Syrian Peoples!" He said into the radio station's recording machine: "I have seen the Chinese people's powerful force against war and aggression. We Syrian people will not show weakness in the face of any imperialist aggression." Then, Gamal Ibrahim Salama, a member of the Egyptian youth delegation, immediately picked up the microphone of the recording machine and loudly said in Chinese: "China loves Egypt! Egypt loves China!"

    Many foreign guests were also busy recording what they saw in various ways. The vast majority of people were busy taking pictures. Sapo Bella, a Romanian woodcut artist who had won the National Prize, quickly waved his brush and sketched the climax of the scene on Tiananmen Square. Journalists from Egypt, the German Democratic Republic, and Czechoslovakia were busy recording, and they will broadcast the grand occasion of the Chinese people's festival to the people of their own countries at the end of the parade.

    As the student parade contingent just passed, the music "Joy of the Masses" from the large ensemble of national musical instruments of the literary and art contingent gradually came. People cheered and applauded, congratulating the increasingly prosperous contingent holding high the huge banner "Struggle to Implement the Socialist Literary and Art Line."

    Behind the dance troupes of various ethnic groups, the artists carried their works. A model of an elephant more than two zhang tall carried a six-foot-tall cyan vase filled with flowers of various colors, symbolizing the "renewal of all things" in the motherland; a hand scroll "Splendid Rivers and Mountains" more than three zhang wide was displayed in front of Tiananmen, and huge four-panel screens on both sides of the hand scroll depicted the scene of hundreds of flowers blooming in all seasons of the motherland. Dancers and acrobats performed Luozidances, umbrella fan dances, and vehicle skills. The "folk artists" from the suburbs—old farmers—skillfully performed flying forks. Eighteen mobile "stages" advanced slowly, and the actors performed the most exciting scenes from newly staged Peking operas, dramas, operas, and films.

    In the melodious folk music, a huge peacock suddenly passed by, with a dozen peacock girls performing peacock dances on the peacock's body. For a while, the square seemed to turn into an aquatic world, with mussel shells flapping their two green shells, breathing in the sunlight; fish wagged their tails, shuttling through the green waves; followed by nine flower dragons as if soaring and rolling in the ocean, playfully chasing each other from left to right, bringing the joyous mood of the whole audience to a climax.

    The parade today also included members of handicraft production cooperatives, industrialists and businessmen, citizens, and religious circles.

    The sports contingent of 10,000 athletes skillfully performed various graceful gymnastics movements and postures such as basketball shooting and weightlifting.

    After the sports contingent passed, the mass parade lasting two hours and twenty-five minutes ended. At this time, people surged towards Jinshui Bridge like a tide. Countless balloons and fireworks rose into the square. People waved bouquets and colorful flags and cheered to Chairman Mao and other Party and state leaders. On the sidewalks of East and West Chang'an Avenue on both sides of Tiananmen, and on the high-rise buildings, citizens watching the National Day celebration and parade applauded and cheered, and the whole city was jubilant.

    Chairman Mao and Party and state leaders walked to the east and west sides of the Tiananmen Gate tower, waved to the cheering people, and expressed their gratitude to the international friends on the viewing platform. (Attached picture)

    歌唱伟大的祖国  高呼共产党万岁
    抬着完成和超额完成五年计划的图表
    五十万人大游行
    新华社1日讯  首都五十万人民在“歌唱祖国”乐曲声中开始了国庆节大游行。
    仪仗队抬着巨大的字标：“中国共产党万岁”、“迎接第二个五年计划”、“艰苦奋斗，勤俭建国”、“把反右派斗争进行到底，继续开展全民整风运动”、“解放台湾”。
    从广场东面传来一片鼓声，一万名少先队员走到天安门前。许许多多鸽子和气球，从孩子们手里飞向天空。
    游行的人排成九十四路纵队并肩前进。已经超额完成第一个五年计划的北京工人们，抬着五幅四公尺长的图表，上面标志着我国社会主义工业建设的各项成就。
    工人的队伍来到天安门，检阅台上立刻活跃起来。党和国家的领导人和许多贵宾，不断地向浩浩荡荡前进的工人们招手致意。
    十万工人举着国旗和共产党党旗、挥舞着红色的和黄色的花束，抬着各种模型、完成和超额完成生产计划的字标和图表，几乎遮盖住工人的队伍。“毛主席万岁！”“中国共产党万岁！”的呼声响彻云霄。彭真市长在天安门城楼上喊着：“工人同志们万岁！”
    在北京清河制呢厂的队伍里，刚在两天前由车间主任下车间当了工人的张恒富特别高兴。他高举手臂，面向着天安门城楼，用力挥舞他手中的花束。他在那束花的绿叶上写着：“毛主席：我在28日又回到车间当工人了。我以前是个车间主任。我愿意长期在机器上干活，使社会主义社会早日建成。”
    走在各路工人游行队伍最前面的都是老工人。长辛店机车车辆修理工厂四位年近六旬的“二七”老工人抬着一幅“中国共产党万岁”的字标，精神百倍地带领着青年工人在天安门广场前进。
    一股人流里出现了有轨和无轨电车的模型。走在这支队伍最前面的是十八位有二十二年到三十四年工龄的老工人。老工人陈国林对他的伙伴们说：“我觉着越活越年轻了。”九年前，几乎整年吃稀粥的电车老司机张振方眼望着看不到头的欢乐人群，激动地说：“祖国一年一个样子。人是一年比一年欢乐。我真觉得骄傲！”
    今天，工人队伍里出现了许多新工厂的名称。华北无线电器材厂是今天参加游行的工厂里最年轻的一个。这个工厂过了国庆节就要开工生产。
    郊区农民抬着各种作物丰收的模型。其中有颗粒饱满的谷子和高粱，有金黄的玉米，有绽桃吐絮的棉花。有些农民抬着肥猪和奶牛的模型。一幅巨大的图表表明：今年北京郊区农民供应城市的蔬菜比去年增加三亿斤，猪的数量增加三倍多。
    东郊区星火农业生产合作社的社员、六十三岁的贫农杨清山，举起一颗五斤重的大白薯，欢呼“毛主席万岁！”他的声音刚落，六十七岁的李海福举起一尺长的玉米，领着队伍高呼“中国共产党万岁！”
    农民队伍里有一批引人注目的“小农民”，他们是今年暑假里参加农业生产的初中毕业生，他们立志要做新中国第一代有文化的农民。
    农民队伍里出现了一批新农民，他们是响应党和政府号召到农村参加体力劳动的干部。原来在南苑区人民委员会工作的王云霞、王腾芳、林学屏三个女干部，在游行前和农民愉快地谈着。王腾芳说：
  “虽然我们没有为郊区今年农业丰收做多少事，但今天以一个获得丰收郊区农民队伍一分子接受毛主席检阅，感到很大光荣。”
    中央和北京市的机关干部的队伍，抬着我国完成第一个五年计划的各项指标的图表和模型，好像是一个我国伟大建设成就的活动展览会。他们当中有许多人是反右派斗争中的积极分子。
    科学工作者们高举着“科学为社会主义服务”的大字标语。著名科学家钱三强走在队伍的最前面。他不住地向天安门挥舞着手中的花束，并且兴奋地说，1950年国庆节，他从观礼台上看科学院队伍只有几行人，1952年国庆节，他领队的科学院队伍也只有五百人，今年科学院的队伍是一千五百人。
    青年学生的队伍欢呼、跳跃地前进。他们用花朵扎的字标、轻气球挂着的字标，都用同样一句：“永远跟着共产党走！”这个队伍里有最近刚入学的工农出身的大学生。在北京铁道学院运输系新学生队伍中，杨茂林是最被人们注意的一个，他是铁路上“杨茂林先进装车法”创造者，全国人民代表大会代表。在学生队伍中有不少同青年人一样热情奔放的老教授。
    毛主席不断地向游行的人们频频招手。
    游行的人不断向毛主席和观礼台上的国际友人招手，向从埃及、叙利亚来的友人们欢呼。叙利亚学生代表团团长哈利勒·哈尔德·阿卜杜勒·努尔兴奋地用中国话呼喊：“中叙人民友好万岁！”他对着广播电台的录音机说：“我看到了中国人民强大的反对战争反对侵略的力量。我们叙利亚人民对任何帝国主义的侵略也不示弱。”接着，埃及青年代表团的团员加马勒·易卜拉欣·萨拉马立即拿起录音机的话筒，大声地用中国话说：“中国爱埃及！埃及爱中国！”
    许多外宾们还忙着用各种方法把自己所看到的情景摄记下来。绝大多数的人都在忙着摄影。罗马尼亚曾经荣获国家奖金的木刻画家萨波·贝拉迅速地挥动着画笔，把天安门广场上的高潮场面绘成了一幅速写。埃及、民主德国和捷克斯洛伐克的新闻工作者在忙着录音，他们将在游行结束时，就把中国人民节日的盛况向自己国家的人民播送。
    学生游行队伍刚走过，渐渐传来文艺大队的民族乐器大合奏的乐曲“万众欢腾”。人们欢呼、鼓掌，祝贺这支高举着“为贯彻社会主义文艺路线而斗争”巨大标语牌的队伍日益繁荣。
    在各民族的舞蹈队后面，美术家们抬着他们的作品。一只二丈多高的大象模型上，背着六尺高的青色花瓶，插满各色花朵，这是象征着祖国的“万象更新”；一幅三丈多宽的大手卷“锦绣河山”展现在天安门前，巨幅的四扇屏分别在手卷两旁，画出了祖国四季百花盛开的情景。舞蹈、杂技演员玩起洛子舞、伞扇舞和车技。从郊区赶来的“民间艺术家”——老农民异常熟练地耍着飞钗。十八座活动的“舞台”徐徐前进，演员们在上面表演出新上演的京剧、话剧、歌剧和影片上最精彩的场面。
    在优美的民间音乐声中，一支巨大的孔雀忽然展屏而过，十几个孔雀姑娘在孔雀身上表演孔雀舞。一会儿，广场又好像变了水族世界，蚌壳扇动两片绿壳，在阳光下呼吸；鱼儿摆动着尾巴，在绿波中穿来穿去；接着而来的是九条花龙宛如在海洋里纵腾翻滚，忽左忽右地嬉戏追逐，把全场人们欢乐的情绪引到了顶峰。
    今天参加游行的，还有手工业生产合作社社员、工商业者、市民和宗教界的队伍。
    一万名运动员组成的体育大队，熟练地做着各种优美的体操动作和投篮、举重等姿势。
    体育大队经过后，结束了历时二时二十五分的群众游行。这时，人们像潮水一般涌向金水桥前。广场上升起无数气球和礼花。人们挥舞着花束和彩旗向毛主席等党和国家的领导人欢呼。天安门两端的东西长安街人行道上，高层建筑物上，观看国庆盛典和游行的市民们鼓掌欢呼，全城市民在欢腾。
    毛主席及党和国家领导人走向天安门城楼东西两侧，向欢呼的人们招手致意，向观礼台上的国际友人表示谢意。（附图片）
