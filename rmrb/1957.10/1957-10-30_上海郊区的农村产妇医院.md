    Amidst the lush green vegetable fields of Shanghai's western suburbs stands an eye-catching red brick building, bearing the sign "Hongxing Agricultural Cooperative First Maternity Hospital." This was established by the Hongxing Second and Third Sub-cooperatives of Hongqiao Township using only 700 yuan from the cooperative's welfare fund and utilizing an old, dilapidated ancestral hall.

    When I visited this hospital on the afternoon of October 14th, I happened to see a new mother being discharged. Her face was beaming as she held a chubby baby, with the midwife and assistant midwife seeing her off.

    This mother, named Cao Jizhen, is a member of the Hongxing Third Sub-cooperative. This is her third child. She happily told me that she had a difficult labor at home with her previous child, which made her very anxious. This time, thanks to the prenatal check-ups provided by the maternity hospital and the care of the midwife during labor, the delivery was very smooth. The agricultural cooperative also gave her a month of maternity leave and a ten-yuan maternity allowance after the birth.

    We toured the hospital. In a spacious recovery room were five clean beds, paintings hung on the whitewashed walls, and fresh flowers adorned the vases on the tables. Two recently delivered mothers were resting quietly in bed; on another bed, two chubby babies were sleeping sweetly. In the clinic, the assistant midwife was waiting for mothers to come for prenatal check-ups; the registration book already had more than one hundred and sixty expectant mothers registered. The rural women, who always had to take care of everything themselves after giving birth, were receiving such kind care for the first time.

    Zhu Zhenping, the assistant midwife sent by the Western Suburbs Maternal and Child Health Center to guide the work here, led me to visit the delivery room and said that the medical equipment such as the birthing bed, tea table, and medical cabinet were all made by the cooperative's carpenters and painters themselves, while more than ten kinds of medical instruments such as syringes, scales, blood pressure monitors, and stethoscopes were borrowed from the Western Suburbs Maternal and Child Health Center. Since this maternity hospital opened in March of this year, thirty-four mothers have given birth here. Some mothers are not yet accustomed to giving birth in the hospital, so the maternity hospital sends midwives to the members' homes to deliver the babies. They have delivered a total of seventy-eight babies, and both mothers and children are safe. They perform prenatal examinations on every pregnant woman, and if they find any difficult birth situations or twins, they promptly advise the pregnant women to go to hospitals in the city with better facilities for delivery.

    As I finished my visit and left the hospital, Lu Jinmei, a midwife with thirty years of experience, carrying her medical kit, walked out of the hospital gate with me. She bid us farewell, saying that she was going to visit some newly discharged mothers and babies.

    上海郊区的农村产妇医院
    新华社记者　王洪仙
    在上海西郊区绿油油的菜田中间，有一座引人注目的红砖瓦房，门上挂着“虹星农业社第一妇产医院”的牌子。这是虹桥乡虹星第二分社、第三分社只花了社里七百元福利金，利用一个破旧祠堂创办起来的。
    记者在10月14日下午往访这所医院时，刚巧碰到一个产妇出院，她满脸喜色，抱着一个胖胖的婴儿，接生员、助产士正在送她。
    这个产妇名叫曹纪珍，是虹星第三分社的社员。她已经是生第三个孩子了。她高兴地告诉我，她前一次在家里生小孩难产，心里很惊慌。这次生育因为有产妇医院在产前检查，临产时又有接生员照顾，生产十分顺利。产后农业社还给她一个月产假，补贴了十元生育费。
    我们参观了医院。在一间宽敞的休养室里有五张洁净的床位，粉刷过的墙上挂着画，桌上的花瓶里插着鲜花。两个刚分娩的产妇正安静地躺在床上；另一张床上两个胖胖的婴儿甜蜜地睡着。在门诊室里，助产士正在等待前来作产前检查的产妇；挂号簿上已经有一百六十多名产妇登记了。接生员拿着产妇带来的鸡蛋、大米、蹄膀，正在厨房里为她们烧饭做菜。向来生孩子后都是亲自操劳的农村妇女，第一次受到这样亲切的照顾。
    西郊区妇幼保健所派来这里指导工作的助产士朱振屏带领记者参观了临产室后说，这些医疗设备如产床、茶几，医疗橱等都是社里木匠、漆匠自己做的，而注射器、磅秤、血压表、听诊器等十多种医疗器械是由西郊区妇幼保健所借用的。这个产妇医院今年3月份开办以来，已经有三十四位产妇在这里接生。有些产妇还不习惯在医院生孩子，产妇医院就派出接生员到社员家里去接生，一共接生了七十八次，母子都很安全。她们对每一产妇都作产前检查，如检查出有疑难生育情况或双生子等都及时劝告产妇到市内设备好的医院去生育。
    记者结束了访问离开医院时，一位有三十年经验的接生员陆金妹背了医药包，与记者一同走出医院大门，她向我们告别说，要去探望一些新出院的产妇和婴儿。
