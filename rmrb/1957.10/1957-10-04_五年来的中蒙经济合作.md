Five Years of Sino-Mongolian Economic Cooperation
	Ning Hexian

October 4th this year marks the fifth anniversary of the signing of the “Economic and Cultural Cooperation Agreement between the People's Republic of China and the Mongolian People's Republic.” In the past five years, economic and cultural cooperation between China and Mongolia has greatly developed, further consolidating and strengthening the traditional friendship between the two peoples through this cooperation.

The economic relations between China and Mongolia were interrupted for many years before the founding of the People's Republic of China. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, economic relations between the two countries quickly resumed. However, in the early years, the scope of economic cooperation was not large, the scale was small, and the development was uneven. The signing of the Sino-Mongolian Economic and Cultural Cooperation Agreement wrote a new page in the history of Sino-Mongolian economic relations, opening up a broad road for the normal development of economic and trade relations between the two countries.

According to the provisions of the Sino-Mongolian Economic and Cultural Cooperation Agreement, the Chinese and Mongolian governments signed the Sino-Mongolian “1953 Goods Turnover and Payment Agreement” on August 20, 1953. This agreement was not only an important step in implementing the Economic and Cultural Cooperation Agreement, but also the first trade agreement signed between China and Mongolia. Since then, a trade agreement has been signed every year, and the mode of trade has begun to become standardized.

The changes in Sino-Mongolian trade volume in the past five years are as follows (with 1952 as 100):

	1953	685
	1954	1,070
	1955	1,488
	1956	3,832
	1957	5,095

In the past five years, the trade volume between our two countries has increased nearly fifty times. Sino-Mongolian trade has occupied an important position in China's foreign trade, and in Mongolia's foreign trade, it has maintained the second position for several years.

In the past five years, the Mongolian people, with brotherly friendship, have supplied China with more than 150,000 draught horses and nearly one million large and small animal hides. In addition, they also supplied goods such as antlers, pilose antlers, antelope horns, cream, horsetail hair, horse mane, wool, cashmere, camel hair, casings, astragalus, mushrooms, and animal bones. The Mongolian people have always been generous in supplying the goods we need. In the annual horse handover work, the Mongolian side always organizes a large number of cadres and herdsmen to select good horses from almost all provinces and from countless herds spread across the Mongolian grasslands, transport them over long distances, and hand them over to Chinese farmers for use. The horses supplied by Mongolia to us in these five years, if all used in North China to pull double-wheeled double-furrow plows, can cultivate 9.3 million mu of land every year. Because the horses supplied by Mongolia to our country are strong, hardworking, easy to tame, and suitable for our climate, they are warmly welcomed by Chinese farmers.

Similarly, China has also supplied the Mongolian People's Republic with a variety of daily necessities, silks and satins, grains, woolen fabrics, handicrafts, minerals, chemical medicines, machinery, and equipment for match factories, porcelain factories, badge factories, button factories, fruit candy factories, and printing factories, which Mongolia needs, playing a certain role in Mongolia's economic construction and improving the people's material life. Moreover, many of our factories also specially produce traditional goods favored by Mongolian herdsmen, such as horsehide, scented cowhide, damask satin, figured satin, snuff, and step bows, which are also warmly welcomed by the Mongolian people.

The “Agreement between the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Government of the Mongolian People's Republic on Economic and Technical Assistance” signed in Ulaanbaatar, the capital of Mongolia, on August 29, 1956, is another major step in implementing the Sino-Mongolian “Economic and Cultural Cooperation Agreement.” It once again embodies the great desire for sincere cooperation between socialist countries. This agreement stipulates that the Chinese government will provide the government of the Mongolian People's Republic with 160 million rubles of gratuitous assistance in the four years from 1956 to 1959, which will be used to help Mongolia build wool textile factories, paper mills, thermal power plants, glass factories, brick and tile factories, prefabricated wooden house factories, vegetable farms, sports fields, gymnasiums, roads in Ulaanbaatar and suburban highways and bridges. Some of these projects are under construction, and some are under survey and design. Now a large number of Chinese engineering and technical personnel and workers are working side by side with Mongolian workers and brothers on the construction of these projects.

China and Mongolia are both socialist countries. In the big family of the socialist camp, each member country can overcome the difficulties encountered in economic construction through mutual assistance and reasonable international division of labor, thereby accelerating the common economic upsurge of the entire socialist camp. Our assistance to the Mongolian People's Republic is a concrete manifestation of this spirit and an internationalist obligation of the Chinese people. The development of the Mongolian economy will also increase the strength of the entire peace and democracy camp, and will also provide better conditions for further development of economic cooperation between China and Mongolia. This is in line with the wishes of the Chinese and Mongolian people.

In terms of scientific and technological cooperation, there have also been some developments in the past five years. Mongolia has sent some workers and technicians to more than a dozen enterprises in China, such as tobacco factories, brick and tile factories, Beijing Hotel, match factories, garden departments, and fine art printing houses in Beijing, Tianjin, and Tangshan, for internships. Most of these personnel have completed their studies and returned home. Currently, there are also interns in China studying Xiang embroidery and the manufacture of folk musical instrument handicrafts.

In the cause of Sino-Mongolian economic cooperation, the Ulaanbaatar-Jining Railway, which opened to traffic on January 3, 1956, has practical significance. It not only shortens the distance between China and Mongolia and facilitates the exchange of goods between the two countries, but also has a direct relationship with the exchange of goods between China and the Soviet Union and the European People's Democratic countries.

The experience of Sino-Mongolian economic cooperation once again shows that economic cooperation conducted on an equal footing can achieve mutually beneficial results regardless of the size of the country.

On the eve of the fifth anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Mongolian Economic and Cultural Cooperation Agreement, the Mongolian trade delegation came to Beijing. Now, the Sino-Mongolian trade negotiations for 1958 have begun. We believe that through this negotiation, the cause of Sino-Mongolian economic cooperation will be further developed.

Note: 1957 is calculated according to the agreed amount and does not include export assistance to Mongolia.

    五年来的中蒙经济合作
    宁鹤仙
    今年10月4日是“中华人民共和国和蒙古人民共和国经济及文化合作协定”签订五周年。五年来，中蒙两国的经济和文化合作有了很大的发展，通过这种合作，更进一步地巩固和加强了两国人民的传统友谊。
    中蒙两国的经济关系在中华人民共和国成立前，曾经中断过许多年。中华人民共和国成立后，两国间的经济关系很快就恢复了。不过，在最初几年，经济合作的范围还不大，规模还很小，发展也不均衡。中蒙经济及文化合作协定的签订，在中蒙经济关系史上写下了新的一页，为两国间经济贸易关系的正常发展开辟了一条康庄大道。
    根据中蒙经济及文化合作协定的规定，中蒙两国政府在1953年8月20日签订了中蒙“1953年货物周转及付款协定”。这个协定不仅是执行经济及文化合作协定的一个重要步骤，而且也是我国同蒙古签订的第一个有关贸易的协定。从那时起，每年都签订一个贸易协定，贸易的方式也开始步入正规。
    五年来中蒙贸易额变化如下（以1952年为100）：
    1953年  685
    1954年  1，070
    1955年  1，488
    1956年  3，832
    1957年  5，095
    五年来，我们两国间的贸易额增加了近五十倍。中蒙贸易在我国对外贸易中已占着重要的地位，而在蒙古对外贸易中，几年来，一直保持着第二位。
    五年来，蒙古人民怀着兄弟般的友谊，供应了我国十五万多匹耕马和将近一百万张大小皮张。此外，还供应了鹿角、鹿茸、羚羊角、奶油、马尾、马鬃、羊毛、羊绒、驼毛、肠衣、黄芪、蘑菇、兽骨等商品。我们需要的商品，蒙古人民从来就是慷慨供应的。在每年的马匹交接工作中，蒙古方面总是要组织大批干部和牧民，在全国几乎所有的省份中，在遍布蒙古草原的无数马群中，挑选良马，长途赶运，交给我国农民使用。蒙古在这五年中供应我们的马匹，如果全部用在华北地区牵引双轮双铧犁，每年可以耕种九百三十万亩土地。由于蒙古供给我国的马匹力大耐劳，易于驯服，适宜我国气候等特点，所以受到我国农民热烈欢迎。
    同样，我国也以蒙古所需要的多种日用品、绸缎、粮食、呢绒、手工艺品、矿产品、化工医药、机器、火柴厂、瓷器厂、制徽章厂、钮扣厂、水果糖厂、印刷厂等设备供给了蒙古人民共和国，对蒙古的经济建设和改善人民的物质生活也起了一定的作用。而且我们许多工厂还为蒙古特制一些蒙古牧民所喜爱的马?皮、香牛皮、幛缎、库缎、鼻烟和步弓等传统商品，这些商品也受到蒙古人民的热烈欢迎。
    1956年8月29日，中蒙两国政府在蒙古首都乌兰巴托签订的“关于中华人民共和国给予蒙古人民共和国经济和技术援助的协定”，是执行中蒙“经济及文化合作协定”的又一重大步骤。它再一次地体现了社会主义国家间真诚合作的伟大愿望。这个协定规定我国政府在1956年到1959年的四年内将以一亿六千万卢布无偿地援助蒙古人民共和国政府，用来帮助蒙古建设毛纺厂、造纸厂、火力发电厂、玻璃厂、砖瓦厂、木房屋预制厂、蔬菜农场、运动场、体育馆、乌兰巴托市内道路及市郊公路和桥梁等项目。在这些项目中有的正在施工，有的正在勘测设计。现在我国的大批工程技术人员和工人正在同蒙古工人兄弟并肩从事这些项目的建设。
    中蒙两国都是社会主义国家，在社会主义阵营的大家庭中，每个成员国都可以通过互相帮助和合理的国际分工来克服经济建设中所遇到的困难，从而加速整个社会主义阵营的经济共同高涨。我们对蒙古人民共和国的援助，正是这种精神的具体体现，也是我国人民的一项国际主义义务。蒙古经济的发展，也就增加了整个和平民主阵营力量，同时也将为进一步发展中蒙两国的经济合作提供更好的条件。这是符合中蒙两国人民的愿望的。
    在科学技术合作方面，这五年来也有了一些发展。蒙古曾经派遣了一些工人和技术人员到我国北京、天津及唐山等地的烟草厂、砖瓦厂、北京饭店、火柴厂、园林部门及美术印刷所等十几个企业进行实习。这些人员大部分已经学成回国。目前在我国的还有学习湘绣和制造民间乐器手工艺等方面的实习生。
    在中蒙经济合作事业中，1956年1月3日通车的乌兰巴托—集宁铁路有着现实的意义。它不仅缩短了中蒙两国的距离，便利两国间的物资交流，而且对我国同苏联及欧洲人民民主国家的物资交流也有直接的关系。
    中蒙经济合作的经验再次表明，在平等基础上进行的经济合作，不论国家大小，都可以收到相互有利的结果。
    在中蒙经济及文化合作协定签订五周年的前夕，蒙古贸易代表团来到了北京。现在，1958年度的中蒙贸易谈判已经开始。我们相信，通过这次谈判，中蒙经济合作事业将会更进一步地得到发展。
   1957年是按协议数计算的，也不包括对蒙援助出口。
