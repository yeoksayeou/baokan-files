    Tungsten, Tin, Bismuth, and Molybdenum Found in Almost Every County
    Guangdong Rich in Mineral Deposits
    (Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 7th) Geological workers, after several years of exploration, have confirmed that Guangdong Province is very rich in underground mineral deposits. Currently, 55 types of minerals have been discovered, most of which are urgently needed for our country's industrial construction.
    Tungsten, tin, bismuth, and molybdenum are found in almost every county in Guangdong Province. In addition, a large crystal mine, rare in the world, has been discovered on Hainan Island.
    Before liberation, Guangdong had always been considered a "poor iron" province. However, now the iron ore deposits discovered on Hainan Island alone have reserves of several hundred million tons, and the quality is very good. A manganese mine discovered here is also of great industrial value.
    Before liberation, Guangdong Province lacked geological personnel, and no formal exploration of underground resources had been conducted. Therefore, the situation of underground resources had always been a mystery. Now, Guangdong has more than 30 exploration and prospecting teams. In June of last year, the South China Regional Geological Survey Team of the Guangdong Geological Bureau of the Ministry of Geology, with the help of Soviet experts, also began geological mapping work.

    钨锡铋钼几乎县县都有
    广东矿藏丰富
    据新华社广州7日电　经过数千名地质工作者几年来勘查证实，广东省地下矿藏非常丰富。目前已经发现矿种五十五种，其中大部分是我国工业建设所急需的矿产。
    钨、锡、铋、钼，在广东省几乎每县都有。另外，在海南岛还发现一个世界上少有的大水晶矿。
    解放以前，广东一直被认为是“贫铁”的省份。但是，现在仅海南岛发现的铁矿，储量就有几亿吨，质量也很好。在这里发现的一个锰矿，也是很有工业价值的。
    解放以前，广东省因为缺乏地质工作人员，对地下资源没有做过正规的勘查，因此地下资源情况如何始终是一个谜。现在，广东共有三十多个勘探队和普查队。去年6月，地质部广东地质分局的南岭区域地质测量队，在苏联专家帮助下，还开始了地质填图工作。
