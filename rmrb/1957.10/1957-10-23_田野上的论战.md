    Debate in the Fields
    By our reporter Ji Xichen
    In these days, the people of Shiniu Village, Wenjiang County, Sichuan, are harvesting the autumn crops while engaging in debates in groups of three or five in small houses, bamboo groves, village paths, and field edges. When the night fog descends, the village becomes even more lively.
    For more than twenty consecutive days, the village has held meetings every night, continuing until late into the night. They freely express their opinions on issues such as agricultural cooperativization, unified purchase and sale, the relationship between workers and peasants, and the struggle between the two paths of capitalism and socialism. More than two hundred households have voiced nearly three thousand opinions, including well-intentioned criticisms, beautiful wishes, as well as erroneous opinions and malicious slander...
    Late-Night Debate
    In the darkness, flickering lights shine inside a bamboo-fenced courtyard. A dense crowd fills the hall. Late-arriving girls squeeze tightly, standing beside the melon trellis outside the door.
    "As the saying goes, lies don't last long, and dark clouds can't block the sun. Now that the debate has begun, who has any opinions to share?" The person presiding over the meeting casts an inquiring glance around.
    The meeting hall is silent for a moment.
      "I have something to say!"
    A middle-aged man wrapped in a white headscarf slowly emerges from the back of the crowd.
    "I want to report to everyone: Gan Hongqing's wife, a well-to-do middle peasant, said that the unified purchase starved her sister to death. Now that the facts have been clarified, this is completely a lie." The speaker is called Li Benchu. A few days ago, in order to clarify the facts, he made a special trip of seventeen li to Yongxing Township to conduct an investigation. This poor peasant, who firmly defends the socialist cause, shows an angry expression on his face, and he continues: "Her sister suffered from illness for three years and was a recipient of government support. Not only did the government not purchase her grain, but it also supplied her with several hundred catties of grain. When her sister died of illness after the autumn harvest, there were still dozens of catties of rice under her bed..."
    In the dim light, the crowd immediately stirs and becomes noisy.
      "Oh, so that's how it is!"
    "Listen to that, they're blaming the unified purchase for someone's death."
      "Ask her, why did she make up rumors against her conscience?" A middle-aged woman says, patting the child she woke up.
      "Do you even need to ask? She's spreading false rumors so she doesn't have to hand over a single grain, and then the state will send her a few loads of rice. She's got big plans!"
    A burst of laughter sweeps over the crowd.
      "Don't laugh! No one starved to death, but some people were indeed hungry." A young man with a flushed face stands up from a bench. For days, he has been shouting everywhere that 520 catties of grain per person is not enough to eat. Now he says again, "During the year of the unified purchase, I myself went without food for a few days."
    "Went without food? Li Xingcai, what did you eat?"
    "He went to a restaurant in Wenjiang City," someone who knows the details says.
    "You little rascal, you're talking nonsense!" Li Xingcai's father angrily interjects: "We never lacked grain at home. He wouldn't eat the white flour we made at home, he insisted on eating rice, saying that white flour caused internal heat and wasn't filling enough."
    "The young people of the new society haven't suffered, they don't know the hardships of the past!"
    "It's not just the young people who forget their roots, even a few Party members have been corrupted!" Yang Xianqing turns around and criticizes Yu Zhenyuan, who is sitting in the corner, saying: "You're still a Party member, yet you have two or three thousand catties of grain at home, but you're still shouting along with others that you don't have enough to eat. 'If you have gold and silver at home, you have a weighing scale next door.' You're getting so fat, how can you say such things!"
    Everyone looks at Yu Zhenyuan. His face turns pale and then red, and his head hangs low. He covers his face with both hands and says painfully:
    "I was wrong. I drank the capitalist potion, I was blinded, I lost my position!"
    At this moment, Li Guocheng, an old upper-middle peasant and individual farmer who had been silent all along, suddenly says angrily from the dark corner:
    "Humph! That's easy to say. To have enough to eat, unless you get one stone and eight dou..." "One stone and eight dou" was the meager wage paid to hired laborers in this area before liberation. Landlords and rich peasants often used this phrase to insult hired laborers. When Li Guocheng throws this sentence into the meeting like a bomb, everyone present feels angry. The impassioned sounds immediately boil and clamor in the room like dozens of pots:
      "What? Do you still want us to be your hired laborers?"
    "Do you still want to be like when you were the puppet Baozhang, taking two wives, engaging in speculation and profiteering, hiring laborers to exploit us, and riding on our heads?"
    Poor peasant Wu Zhiqing and a group of people stand up with a bang. Woman Li Wusu points at Li Guocheng's nose, revealing many of his misdeeds, and says:
      "You're still dreaming of capitalism! Why don't you open your eyes and see what the world is like today? Trying to undermine our cooperative, that's absolutely impossible!"
      A Clear Contrast
    At midnight, the tit-for-tat debate continues. They talk about the past, talk about the present, and the clear contrast and painful memories burn like a raging fire.
      "I don't feel good when you mention the time before liberation, when you mention it, my tears don't stop!" New upper-middle peasant Li Jicheng angrily recounts his past life. "What kind of world was that? During the day, I was afraid of being conscripted, and at night, I was afraid of being robbed. It was either the landlord squeezing rent and deposits, or the Baojia demanding donations and payments. I paid old-age tax when I was young. In less than ten years, I was forced to move four or five times, so poor that I didn't even have a clod of dirt to hit crows with. I had to push carts and carry sedan chairs. On New Year's Eve, my wife and children were begging for food..."
    When cooperative chairman Li Yuanlong speaks, he fumbles in his pocket, walks to the oil lamp, takes out his notebook, and opens it to the grain accounts he investigated door-to-door, calculating the growth in the whole village's grain consumption, oil consumption, cloth consumption, and agricultural and sideline income before and after liberation, and before and after cooperativization. "For example," he says, "in 1956, the total grain output of the village increased by 49% compared to 1949, and the total income from agricultural and sideline products increased by 61%. The consumption of oil and cloth increased by two or three times. In 1949, each person ate an average of only 380 catties of grain, while in 1956, each person retained an average of 587 catties of grain. In the eleventh team alone, out of 19 households, 16 had stored grain. In addition, 58 poor households in the village completely escaped poverty."
      "Take myself as an example! I had nothing in the past, but now I have everything. Without agricultural cooperativization, could we live such a life? If we weren't liberated, many of us sitting here probably wouldn't even be able to keep our heads!"
    Poor peasant Li Peichu can no longer suppress his anger and stands up several times to ask to speak. He finally gets an opportunity. He says:
      "At that time, a family of three couldn't eat 400 catties of rice in a year. In winter, we wrapped a sackcloth around our navels, put a fire basket between our legs, and dragged a pair of worn straw sandals on our feet. But what about today?"
    He stretches out his hands and takes a few deep puffs of his cigarette, smiling quietly, and says:
    "In the first year I joined the cooperative, my family of five ate more than 2,000 catties of rice, 16 catties of oil, and 50 catties of meat, and wore 14 zhang of cloth, brand new from head to toe. Like everyone else, I can stand up in front of people! Some well-to-do middle peasants say that there's no future in joining the cooperative, but as far as I'm concerned, apart from running the cooperative well and taking the socialist road, I have no other future."
        The Boundary of Differences
    "That's your thinking! We joined the cooperative to sell our labor for food!" Upper-middle peasant Gan Hongchun says coldly.
    "No wonder you're in the cooperative, but your heart is outside it, you're longing for individual farming..."
    "Without the cooperative, I can still live..."
    "That's a capitalist life. Lingering over exploitation and unwilling to work, that's the root of your dissatisfaction with the cooperative!"
    "We must dig up the roots of capitalism and install socialist ideas!"
    As the debate goes deeper and analyzes why well-to-do peasants are wavering, why they are dissatisfied with unified purchase and cooperatives, why poor peasants and upper-middle peasants have two different attitudes towards the same issue, and what the root of the struggle between the two roads in the countryside is, everyone realizes that the most fundamental boundary causing the differences is labor versus exploitation.
    "What are you talking about, I'm exploiting? Hiring long-term laborers? I paid them wages. Doing business? I wore out my shoes. Buying green crops? Someone sold them, so I bought them. It was mutually agreeable, how is that exploitation? As for me not working hard in the cooperative, that's because I'm not at ease!"
    Like many well-to-do middle peasants who do not admit that they are exploiting, old upper-middle peasant Gan Hongchun tries his best to defend his exploitative behavior.
    Before liberation, Gan Hongchun rented land and was exploited by landlords. At the same time, he hired long-term laborers. In order to get rich, he used to lend money at high interest rates and buy green crops. In less than two years, he bought ten mu of land.... In the early days of liberation, this unfinished dream gained new vitality. Not only was the oppression of landlords overthrown, but as a peasant, he also received the victorious fruits of rent reduction and deposit refunds, totaling eighty dan of rice. Land reform also gave him fourteen mu of land. So, he cheered for the "four freedoms" and planned to buy the land of several more poor peasants.... Just at this time, unified purchase and sale began, and the high tide of cooperativization surged under his feet, and the capitalist dream was forever shattered. And this is the reason why he has repeatedly resisted the Party's policies and been dissatisfied with unified purchase and cooperativization since 1953.
    After calculating the accounts of exploitation one by one, Gan Hongchun lowers his head and says nothing. The poor farmers, who have sharpened their eyes, become even more excited and high-spirited. For a long time, the house resounds with the sound of justice:
    "Is that so? Cooperativization blocked your capitalist road, so you're always uneasy."
      "Thank you, Chairman Mao! If it weren't for cooperativization two years earlier, our land would have become yours, Gan Hongchun's!"
    ...That night, Gan Hongchun didn't close his eyes at all. For two or three days in a row, he couldn't sleep or eat. His face was pale, and he didn't say a word all day, hiding alone in a dark room without lights, immersed in painful struggle:
      "That's right, what they said is all right! Ever since that year, I've been like a defeated rooster, unable to muster any energy to do anything. Before that, when I was a labor model and the head of the mutual aid group, production was good, work was good, and the newspapers were full of my praises... But why did I become silent as soon as the general line was publicized? ...Later, I reluctantly joined the cooperative, didn't invest, was passive in production, secretly engaged in speculation, saw nothing that pleased me, and was always angry, scolding the dog and cursing the chicken. What is the reason for all this? ...Lingering over exploitation, lingering over the old road? Yes. Capitalism is dead, but its ghost is still clinging to you..."
    Just then, the door creaks open, and three people appear at the door. Poor peasants Wu Zifu, Zheng Guoying, and Li Benchu, according to the instructions of the prefectural committee work team and the Party branch to win over and unite with well-to-do middle peasants, automatically form a "help group" and come to Gan Hongchun's home.
    "Although you engaged in exploitation, your main income still comes from labor, so we are still a family. We hope that you will join us and take the road to common prosperity! Whether you can firmly take it depends on whether you can completely abandon the part that exploits! The capitalist road is dirty and smelly, not only is it impossible to take it in the new society, but it was also impossible to take it in the old society! Have you forgotten how Tang Zhaoshi in our village went bankrupt? He didn't climb up, but instead lost his family fortune. His family of several people were so poor that they slept in rice barrels, cooked with pottery pots, and ate with incense burners. Do you want to live that kind of life, or do you want to live the life you're living now?"
    "At that time, the big fish ate the small fish. If I had been liberated two years later, wouldn't I have been the same as her!"
    "Furthermore, has your income decreased after joining the cooperative?" The poor peasants further point out his future prospects: "No. According to your own calculations, before liberation, your exploitative income was 600 yuan, and your labor income was 900 yuan. Now there is no exploitative income, which is completely right. However, your total labor income has increased to 1,400 yuan. It's only been two years, and if everyone works together and produces well, the future of the cooperative will be truly bright!"
    They talk until two o'clock in the morning. As he sends them to the door, Gan Hongchun smiles on his face and shouts loudly at the shadows disappearing into the darkness:
      "Don't worry! Even if you chase me with sticks, you won't be able to chase me out of the cooperative!"
        The Call of Life
    During the days of the debate, two sentences spread like the wind in the fields:
      "Individual farming, individual farming, each year is worse than the last!"
      "Competition, competition, losing your capital!"
    The small plots of land of a few individual farmers outside the cooperative are isolated and surrounded by the cooperative's contiguous land. Although they are only separated by a field ridge, the difference is so obvious: on this side, the rice ears are so plump that one hand can't hold them, while on that side, they are light and rustling like a rat's tail. On this side, each mu yields 710 catties of hemp and 413 catties of wheat, while on that side, each mu yields only 550 catties of hemp and 360 catties of wheat.... The different harvests dazzle people's eyes like fire.
    The same land, the same water conservancy and climate, why are there different harvests? Is it because they lack fertilizer and invest less? No, Zhou Dejun's investment per mu of land is a dozen yuan more than the cooperative's. As the upper-middle peasant with the highest yield in the village, he has complete cattle and strong labor. When he was mobilized to join the cooperative, he said: "Wait ten years and compare with you!" From then on, he got up early and went to bed late, working day and night with his family of five or six laborers. When the cooperative plowed the land, he plowed the land, when the cooperative transplanted rice, he transplanted rice.... Despite trying to catch up step by step, he still fell behind the times, often missing the season at critical moments. As a result, the harvest became worse each year. After harvesting the autumn crops and handing over the grain, he does a quick calculation and still loses money.
    "One wrong step, ten wrong steps, in the end you get nothing but empty joy!" At a family gathering after dinner, Zhou Dejun says to his family as he calculates the accounts: "If I had listened to Chairman Mao's words and joined the cooperative, we could have received a few hundred yuan more this summer harvest."
    "Alas! What can we do? Each year is worse than the last!" His mother sighs.
    "I said long ago: you can't compete! You can't compete! You insisted on saying that individual farming is freer and wouldn't let us join the cooperative..." His father blames his old wife.
      "While this movement is going on, can we ask if the cooperative wants us?"
    "They want the whole family to be willing. Mom, are you really...?"
      "Hurry up and write the application! This time, we have to run ahead of those few households."
    ...Before the end of the debate, one day, the whole village specifically discussed the gains from the debate. Some said: this movement is neither hurried nor slow, neither cold nor hot, spoken on the lips, felt in the heart, thoughts are unfolded, problems are solved, and the heart is satisfied. The heart that was placed outside the cooperative has been taken back. Some people reported the number of new farm tools and pigs they had recently bought, and some even urged when to send 500,000 catties of surplus grain to the state. When it was the cooperative director's turn to speak, he said: this debate, everyone is a teacher, everyone is a student, digging up roots and removing seedlings, generating new flesh and blood, is a great socialist ideological revolution. Finally, he raises his voice and says solemnly to the people present:
    "On behalf of the cooperative committee, I ask everyone again for their opinions. Does anyone want to withdraw from the cooperative now?"
    The whole room, you look at me, I look at you, silent.
      "No."
      "Then, who wants to join the cooperative?"
      "Me!"
      "Me!"
        "..."
    All eight individual farmers in the village raise their hands.
    At this time, Zhou Decheng, raising both hands, excitedly pushes his way out of the crowd, runs to the middle of the room, and shakes a piece of white paper covered with dense writing. When the noisy crowd is quiet, he says:
    "I want to live a new life, I want to resolutely take the new road! ...Please forgive me for the past. In the past, I was like a dog gnawing on a bone, lingering over capitalism. Should I throw it away? The bone still has some oil. Should I not throw it away? It's just a bone, there's no meat. So, I was up and down, double-minded... This time, the ideological revolution has swept away the dark clouds and the sun is shining again. I want to follow the Communist Party forever!"
    Yes, our people will always face the truth, face the sun, face the beloved Party!

    田野上的论战
    本报记者　纪希晨
    在这些日子里，四川温江县石牛村的人们，一边收秋，一边在小屋里、林盘中、村道旁、田畔上，三五成群地进行着争辩。而当夜雾降临的时候，村庄就更加沸腾起来了。
    一连二十多天，村庄里每天晚上举行着会议，每晚都继续到深更半夜；他们对农业合作化、统购统销、工农关系、资本主义和社会主义两条道路的斗争等问题，畅述着各自的意见。二百多户人家，鸣放了近三千条意见。其中有善意的批评，美好的愿望，也有错误的意见和恶毒的诽谤。……
    深夜的舌战
    黑夜，竹林环抱的篱墙里，闪烁着忽明忽暗的灯光。黑压压的人群拥满了堂屋的会场。晚来的姑娘们，挤得紧紧的站在门外的瓜架旁。
    “常言说，谎话说不久长，乌云遮不住太阳；现在争论开始了，谁有意见请讲？”主持会议的向大家扫过询问的目光。
    会场上沉默了片刻。
      “我有话要说！”
    一个裹着白包头的中年人，慢慢从人群后面挤了出来。
    “我向大家报告一下：富裕中农干洪清老婆说，统购饿死了她的姐姐。现在事实弄清楚了，这完全是谎话。”讲话的人叫李本初，几天前，为了弄清事实真象，特地跑了十七里路，到永兴乡进行了一次调查。这个坚决保卫社会主义事业的贫农脸上现出了愠怒的神色，他继续说：“她姐姐害了三年病，是个供应户，政府不光没有统购过她的粮食，还供应了她几百斤粮。当她姐姐秋后害病死的时候，还有几十斤大米放在床底下。……”
    昏暗中，人群立刻骚动喧嚷了起来。
      “呵，原来是这样！”
    “你们听，把人病死的账也赖给统购了。”
      “问问她，为啥要昧着良心造谣呀？”一个中年妇女拍哄着吵醒的孩子说。
      “那还用说吗？放出空气，好一颗粮不缴，再叫国家给她送几担大米，打算的多安逸！”
    一阵笑声掠过人群的头顶。
      “你们不要笑！人没有饿死，可是，确实饿过肚子。”一个吃得满脸红光的青年人，从板凳上站了起来。几天来，他到处在叫喊，每人留粮五百二十多斤不够吃。这会他又说：“统购那年，我自己就有几天没吃饭。”
    “没吃饭？李兴才，你吃的啥？”
    “他到温江城下饭馆去了。”知底细的说。
    “龟儿子，尽胡说！”李兴才的父亲也气愤愤的插进来：“我们家里从来没有断粮过，家里做的白面，他不吃，非要吃大米不可，他说吃白面有火，不耐饿。”
    “新社会的青年人，没受过罪，不知道过去的艰难呵！”
    “忘本的不光年青人，连少数党员也叫腐蚀了！”杨先清转过身，批评坐在墙角的余振元，说：“你还是个党员哩，家中放着两三千斤谷子，可是也跟人瞎喊没粮吃，‘家中有金银，隔壁有戥称’，你长的白胖白胖的，怎能说这种话呵！”
    所有的人都望着余振元。他脸上一阵青，一阵红，头低低的向下垂着，两手捂住脸，沉痛的说：
    “我错了，我喝了资本主义的迷魂汤，被蒙了眼睛，失了立场！”
    这时，一直默不作声的老上中农、单干户李国成，在黑暗的墙角里，突然忿怒的说：
    “哼！说的好听，要够吃，除非一石八斗……”“一石八斗”是这一带解放前雇工的低微工资，地主富农常用这句话来侮辱雇工。当李国成把这句话像炸弹一样投入会场时，每个到会的人都感到愤怒。激昂的声浪，立刻像几十口滚锅，在屋里沸腾喧嚷着：
      “怎么？你还想叫我们给你当长工吗？”
    “你还想像你当伪保长时候，娶两个老婆，投机倒把，雇长工剥削，骑在我们头上？”
    贫农吴之清和一群人轰的一声站了起来，妇女李吾素指着李国成的鼻子，揭了他许多丑事。并说：
      “你还在做资本主义梦！你为什么不睁眼看看今天是啥世事？想搞垮我们合作社，那是万不能！”
      鲜明的对比
    午夜，针锋相对的论战，一直在继续着。他们谈到过去，谈到现在，鲜明的对比，痛苦的回忆，烈火似的燃烧着。
      “不提解放前我不伤心，提起来我泪不干！”新上中农李吉成，愤怒的诉说着从前的生活。“那是什么世道？白天怕人抓丁，黑夜怕人抢偷，不是地主抽佃加押，就是保甲派捐要款，年青时候就缴了老年税，不到十年逼的我搬了四五个地方，穷得连打老鸦的土巴都没有，只得给人推车、抬轿，大年三十老婆娃娃讨口……”
    社长李元龙发言时，他摸索着口袋，走到油灯前面，掏出了他的记事本，翻开他挨门逐户调查的粮食账，一笔笔数算了解放前后、合作化前后，全村吃粮、吃油、穿布和农副业收入的增长对比情况。“比如”他说：“1956年，全村原粮比1949年增加49％，农副业总收入增加61％，吃油、穿布莫不增加两三倍。1949年每人平均只吃三百八十斤粮食，而1956年每人平均留粮五百八十七斤，单十一队十九户人中，就有十六户存有陈粮。此外，全村还有五十八户贫困户彻底摆脱了贫困。”
      “就说我自己吧！过去我什么也没有，现在什么都有了。没有农业合作化，我们能过这样的生活吗？要不解放，在坐的许多人恐怕连脑壳都保不住吧！”
    贫农李培初再也压制不住自己的激愤，几次站起来要求发言。好容易得到一个机会。他说：
      “那时候，一家三口人一年吃不到四百斤米，到了冬天，肚脐围条麻袋片，腿下夹个火篮，脚上拖双烂片草鞋。可是今天呢？”
    他两手向外一伸，深深地吸了几口烟，静静地笑着说：
    “我入社头一年，五口人就吃了二千多斤米，十六斤油，五十斤肉，穿了十四丈布，从头到脚一崭新。跟别人一样，我也站到人面前来了！有些富裕中农说，入了社没有想头了，可是对我说来，除了搞好合作社，走社会主义道路，别的想头，我再也没有了。”
        分歧的界限
    “那是你们的想头！我们入社是卖工吃饭！”上中农干洪春冷冷的说。
    “怪不得你身在社里，心在社外，想望着单干……”
    “没有合作社，我也能生活，……”
    “那是资本主义的生活。留恋剥削，不愿劳动，是你们不满合作社的根子！”
    “我们要挖资本主义的根子，装社会主义的思想！”
    当论战步步走向深入，讨论分析到富裕农民为什么产生动摇，为什么对统购、合作社不满，为什么同是一个问题，贫农和上中农会有两种不同的态度，以及农村两条道路斗争的根源是什么的时候，大家认识到：引起分歧的最根本的界限，就是劳动与剥削。
    “你说什么，我有剥削？雇长工？我出有工钱，做生意？我跑了脚板。买青苗吗？有人卖，我才买，两相情愿，这算什么剥削？至于我入社不好好劳动，那是因为心里不安逸嘛！”
    像许多不承认自己有剥削的富裕中农一样，老上中农干洪春竭力为自己的剥削行为辩护着。
    解放前，干洪春一面租种田地，受地主剥削；同时，他又雇用长工；为着发财，他曾经放高利贷，买青苗，不到二年，他买了十亩地……。解放初期，这个没有做完的幻梦，又得到了新的生机，这不仅因推翻了地主压迫，而且作为一个农民，减租退押，他还分得了八十石米的胜利果实，土地改革又分了十四亩地。于是，他欢呼着“四大自由”，已经计划好要再买几户贫农的土地……正当这个时候，统购统销开始了，合作化的高潮，在他脚下汹涌起来了，资本主义的幻梦也永远破灭了。而这个，就是他自1953年以后，屡屡抗拒党的政策、不满统购和合作化的原因。
    算过一笔笔剥削账，这时，干洪春低头不语了，而擦亮了眼睛的贫苦农民们，情绪却变得更加激动、昂扬。屋子里，很久很久，响彻着正义的声响：
    “是这样吗？合作化阻挡了你资本主义的道路，所以你老不安逸。”
      “谢谢毛主席！要不是早两年合作化，我们的土地，早变成你干洪春的了！”
    ……这一夜，干洪春完全没有合眼。一连两三天，他睡不着觉，吃不下饭，脸上煞白煞白的，终日不说一句话，独自一个人，躲在不点灯的黑屋中，沉入痛苦的斗争里：
      “是这样，他们说的全对！自打那年起，我就像只打败的公鸡，干啥也提不起精神。在这以前，我当劳动模范和互助联组组长那阵，生产好，工作好，报上登的哇哇叫……可是，为什么从总路线一宣传，我就掩息了呢？……后来，勉强入了社，不投资，生产消极，暗中搞投机，看见啥都不如意，天天火气挺大，指狗骂鸡，这一切到底是什么道理呢？……留恋剥削，留恋旧道路吗？是的。资本主义已经死了，可是它的阴魂还死死的缠着你……”
    正在这当儿，门吱呷一声开了，门口出现了三个人。贫农吴子福、郑国英、李本初，根据地委工作组和党支部争取团结富裕中农的指示，自动组成“帮助小组”，来到了干洪春的家里。
    “你虽有剥削，但你主要收入还是靠劳动，所以我们仍然是一家人。我们希望你和大家一起，走共同富裕的道路！你能不能坚决走，就看你是不是能彻底抛弃剥削的那一部分！资本主义道路又脏又臭，不光新社会走不通，就是旧社会也走不通！你忘记了咱村汤赵氏是怎么破产的？没爬上去，反倒倾家荡产，一家几口人，穷的睡拌桶，做饭用沙锅，吃饭用香炉，你是愿过那种生活，还是过现在的生活呢？”
    “那阵，大鱼吃小鱼，晚解放两年，我还不是和她一样的！”
    “再说入社后，你的收入减少了没有呢？”贫农们进一步指出他的远景前途：“没有，就按你自己计算，解放前你剥削收入六百元，你自己劳动收入九百元，现在剥削收入没有了，这是完全应该的，可是你的劳动总收入却增加到一千四百元，这才只两年，要是大伙齐心干，好好生产，合作社的前途可真光明咧！”
    谈心，一直谈到深夜下两点。临走，干洪春把他们送到门口，脸上堆着笑，向着消失在黑暗中的影子，尽嗓子大声喊：
      “你们放心！如今就是拿上棒棒撵我，也撵不出合作社！”
        生活的召唤
    在论战的日子里，有两句话，风似的传遍田野里：
      “单干，单干，一年不如一年！”
      “比赛，比赛，输了本钱！”
    社外几户单干农民的小块田地，孤零零的分割包围在连成片的合作社的土地里。虽只隔条田坎，可是，区别是那样的明显：这边稻穗蓬胖的一手放不下，那边轻沙沙的像耗子尾巴；这边每亩麻七百一十斤，麦子四百一十三斤，那边每亩麻只有五百五十斤，麦子三百六十斤，……不同的收获，火一样的眩耀着人们的眼睛。
    同样的土地，同样的水利和气候，为什么会有不同的收成？是他们肥料乏、投资少吗？不，周德俊在每亩土地上的投资，比合作社整整要多十几元。作为全村产量最高的上中农，他牛犋全，劳力强，动员他入社，他说：“再等十年，跟你们比比看！”从此，他起早睡晚，带着一家五六个劳动力，日日夜夜拚着干。社里耕地他犁田，社里插秧他……，尽管一步步追赶，可是，他仍然落在时间的后面，节骨眼上常常误季节。这样，收获一年不如一年，收罢秋，上了粮，小算盘一敲，还是赔了钱。
    “错一步，误十步，到末落个空喜欢！”在晚饭后的家庭聚会上，周德俊对家人算着账说：“要是听毛主席的话入了社，今年夏收时，我们可以多分三几百元。”
    “唉！那有啥办法？一年不如一年！”他的妈妈叹息着说。
    “我早说：赛不过！赛不过！你偏说，单干自由些，不叫入社，……”父亲责备着他的老伴。
      “趁这次运动，能不能问一问，社里要不要咱？”
    “人家要全家自愿，妈，你到底……？”
      “快写申请吧！这下咱要跑到那几户的前边。”
    ……论战结束前，有一天，全村专门讨论论战中的收获。有的说：这次运动不慌不忙，不冷不热，说在嘴上，痛在心上，思想摊开了，问题解决了，心里满意了。把放在社外的心收回了。有的人报告了最近新买的农具、猪只的数目，有的还催问何时向国家送交五十万斤余粮。轮到社主任讲话的时候，他说：这次论战，人人做教员，个个当学生，挖根除苗，生肌长肉，是一次伟大的社会主义的思想大革命。说到最后，他提高嗓门、严肃的向到会的人们说：
    “我代表社委会再次征求大家意见，现在有谁要退社吗？”
    全场，你看我，我看你，寂静无声。
      “没有。”
      “那么，谁要入社吗？”
      “我！”
      “我！”
        “……”
    全村八户单干农民全部举起了手。
    这时，举起两只手的周德成，激动的从人丛里挤出来，跑到屋子当中，摇着写得密密麻麻的白纸，待喧嚷的人群静下时，他说：
    “我要过新生活，我要坚决走新道路！……请大家原谅我过去吧，过去我就像狗啃骨头那样，留恋资本主义，丢了吧？骨头还有点油气，不丢吧？光骨头没有肉，这样，我就七上八下，二心不定，……这次，思想革命，扫去乌云，重见了太阳，我要永远跟着共产党！”
    是的，我们的人民，永远面向真理，面向太阳，面向亲爱的党！
