    A Thorough Debate
    Members of the Fourth Team of the First Village of Qingping Township, Wenjiang Convinced Wealthy Middle Peasant Tu Huaxing
    This special report from the New China News Agency: In the great debate in the fourth team of the first village of Qingping Township, Wenjiang County, Sichuan, the capitalist ideological roots of wealthy middle peasant Tu Huaxing's opposition to collectivization were unearthed.
    This debate took the form of a dialectical argument. At the beginning, Tu Huaxing reiterated his opinion, which he had put forward during the "blooming and contending" stage, that "joining the cooperative does not bring in as much income as working individually." Many poor peasants immediately refuted him by citing the conclusive facts that their incomes had increased year after year since the establishment of the cooperative. But Tu Huaxing argued, "Collectivization is only beneficial to you poor peasants. For wealthy peasants, joining the cooperative does not bring in as much income as working individually." These words were in line with the wishes of the few wealthy peasants present, but they could not deny the specific facts of the superiority of collectivization cited by the poor peasants, so no one spoke in support of Tu Huaxing. In order to win over others, Tu Huaxing pointed to a few wealthy peasants and asked, "Don't you also have opinions about collectivization? Why don't you speak up?" The wealthy peasant Zhang Yuepei said, "I originally said that individual households could hide more grain and keep it for themselves, but the cooperative's controls are too strict; after discussion, I realized that this was due to the error of only thinking of myself. This is different from what you said about collectivization only being beneficial to poor peasants." Then, Zhang Yuepei cited some examples to illustrate that collectivization is also beneficial to wealthy peasants. He said: Before I joined the cooperative, after deducting food rations, my annual net income was 110 yuan; after joining the cooperative last year, my net income increased to 150 yuan. This year's income will increase even more.
    But Tu Huaxing remained unconvinced in his heart. He said, "It was wrong for me to say that collectivization is not beneficial to wealthy peasants at all, but everyone has their own specific circumstances, and collectivization is not beneficial to me." At this time, the poor peasant Luo Jinshan immediately exposed his old background. He said, "What are your specific circumstances? Before liberation, your family hired a deaf-mute as a long-term worker, only providing food, without paying wages, and he worked for you for seven years, so that the deaf-mute suffered in silence. Your family also rented land from landlords, and then rented it out at high prices, becoming a second landlord. Before joining the cooperative, you grew sugar cane every year and sold it at high prices, and also made money by speculating. When you say the cooperative is not good, you are just always thinking about exploitation."
    These words silenced Tu Huaxing. Therefore, everyone further pointed out to him that although his family's total income before liberation was 380 yuan to 400 yuan, 50 yuan to 70 yuan of that came from subletting land and hiring long-term workers for exploitation, and his family's labor income was only 320 yuan. Although his family's annual income was 410 yuan when working individually, only 380 yuan was legitimate income, and the excess came from growing too much sugarcane and hemp against the state plan and speculating to sell at high prices. After Tu Huaxing joined the cooperative last year, his family's income reached about 400 yuan, and it will increase this year. From the perspective of legitimate labor income, it is obviously higher than the income before liberation and when working individually.
    Then, many peasants cited the facts that since collectivization, production has increased year after year, the number of poor households in the whole village has decreased from more than 60 to about 10, and about 40 poor households have risen to the living standards of middle peasants, to criticize his capitalist ideology.
    After this reasoning and debate, Tu Huaxing was finally convinced.

    一场刨根挖底的对辩
    温江清平乡一村四社社员说服了富裕中农涂华兴
    本报特约新华社专稿  四川温江县清平乡一村四社在大辩论中，挖出了富裕中农凃华兴反对合作化的资本主义的思想根源。
    这场辩论是以对辩的形式出现的。开头，凃华兴重述了他在鸣放阶段提出的“入社没有单干的收入多”这一意见。许多贫苦农民便举出建社以来自己连年增加收入的确凿事实反驳他。但凃华兴辩解说：“合作化只对你们贫苦农民有利，对富裕农民来说，入社没有单干收入多。”这席话，正合乎在场的少数富裕农民的心愿，但他们又不能不承认贫苦农民举出的合作化优越性的具体事实，因而没有一个人发言支持凃华兴。为了拉拢别人，凃华兴指着少数富裕农民问道：“你们不是也对合作化有意见吗？为什么不说呢？”富裕农民张月培说：“我原来是说单干户可以瞒产多留些粮食，社里卡的太紧；经过讨论我认识了这是一种只顾自己的错误思想作怪。这和你说的合作化光对贫苦农民有利是两码事”。接着，张月培就举出了一些事例，说明合作化对富裕农民也有好处。他说：我入社以前，扣除口粮外，每年净收入一百一十元；去年入社以后，净收入则增加到一百五十元。今年的收入，还要增加很多。
    但凃华兴仍然口服心不服。他说：“我说合作化对富裕农民都没有好处是没有说对，但是每个人有每个人的具体情况，合作化对我是没有利”。这时候，贫苦农民罗金山马上揭露了他的老底子。他说：“你的具体情况是什么呢？解放前你家里雇了个哑巴当长工，光管饭吃，不开工钱，整整替你白干了七年，叫人家哑巴吃黄连有苦说不出。你们家还佃了地主的田，然后再高价转租，自己当二地主。入社以前，你年年种甘蔗高价出卖，并且做投机生意赚钱。你说合作社不好，就是念念不忘剥削。”
    这一下说得凃华兴不吭声了。于是，大家便进一步向他指出：他家在解放前的总收入虽有三百八十元到四百多元，但其中有五十元到七十多元是依靠转租和雇长工剥削来的，自家的劳动收入只有三百二十多元。他家单干时每年的收入虽有四百一十元，但正当的收入只有三百八十元，多余的部分是由于违背国家计划而多种了甘蔗和麻，并投机取巧卖高价钱得来的。而凃华兴去年入社以后，全家的收入达到四百来元，今年还要增加，从正当的劳动收益来看，显然是超过了解放前和单干时的收入的。
    接着，许多农民又纷纷举出合作化以后，连年增产、全社的贫困户由六十多户下降到十来户，并有四十来户贫困户上升到中农生活水平这些日益使大家富裕的事实，来批判他那资本主义思想。
    经过这番说理辩论，终于使凃华兴信服了。
