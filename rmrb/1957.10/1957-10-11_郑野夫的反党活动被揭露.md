In the Battle Against the Rightists:

　　Zheng Yefu's Anti-Party Activities Exposed
Zheng Yefu, Deputy Secretary-General and Director of the Membership Department of the Chinese Artists Association, and a rightist element, was a bourgeois individualist ambitionist who conspired with the Pang Xunqin anti-communist clique to usurp the Party's leadership in the arts and crafts industry, and an ally of the Jiang Feng anti-Party clique in their attempt to bring down the leadership of the Ministry of Culture and the Artists Association.

　　Zheng Yefu came from a landlord family. In 1938, he infiltrated the Party, but was soon arrested and betrayed the Party by surrendering to the enemy. He was investigated during the Three-Anti Campaign, and therefore harbored long-term dissatisfaction with the Party, excluding and attacking the Party members who worked with him, saying that they were "reeking of Party spirit."

　　During the rectification campaign, he spread rumors everywhere, saying that the Ministry of Culture and the Artists Association were practicing sectarianism and actively speaking out for Jiang Feng, who he claimed was being unjustly persecuted. He also colluded with the Pang Xunqin anti-Party clique and the rightist element Song Zhiying from the Handicraft Bureau. On the one hand, he wrote articles in Wenhui Daily and Ta Kung Pao, attacking the Party's leadership in the arts and crafts industry. On the other hand, he stirred up trouble everywhere, inciting discord between artists and the Party, and between arts and crafts artisans and artists. At the same time, he stole the name of the Artists Association and incited Ta Kung Pao to convene a symposium in the arts and crafts industry to launch a frenzied attack on the Party.

　　Under the exposure and criticism of all the staff members of the Artists Association, Zheng Yefu has made several confessions, but they are still not thorough. (Yu Feng)

　　郑野夫的反党活动被揭露
    中国美术家协会副秘书长兼会员工作部主任、右派分子郑野夫，是一个与庞熏琴反共集团共谋，企图篡夺党在工艺美术事业上领导权的资产阶级个人主义野心家，是江丰反党集团企图搞垮文化部和美协党领导的同盟者。
    郑野夫出身于地主家庭，1938年曾混入党内，不久被捕，叛变自首。三反中被审查，因此长期对党不满，排斥和打击与他共事的党员，说他们是“党气熏人”。
    整风期间，他到处散布说，文化部和美协是宗派主义，是打击江丰，积极替江丰喊冤。并与庞熏琴反党集团和手管局右派分子宋之英勾结，一方面在文汇报、大公报写文章，攻击党在工艺美术事业上的领导，一方面又到处煽动点火，挑拨美术家与党、工艺美术艺人与美术家之间的关系；同时盗用美协名义，鼓动大公报召开工艺美术界座谈会，向党猖狂进攻。
    郑野夫在美协全体工作人员的揭露和批判下，已作了几次交代，但仍不彻底。　　　　　　　　　　（郁风）
