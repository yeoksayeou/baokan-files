    Friendship Gives Me Strength
    Chen Jingkai
    The fortieth anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution in the Soviet Union is fast approaching. To celebrate this great festival, as an athlete, I would like to talk about the help that Soviet comrades have given us in weightlifting over the past few years.
    The Third Youth Friendship Games, held during the Sixth World Youth Festival in 1957, was a large-scale sporting event. It was the first time our country had participated in such a large-scale sports event. In this Games, our athletes achieved certain successes. Our weightlifting team participated with seven people, achieving one first place, one second place, two fourth places, and three sixth places. All seven scored points. These achievements powerfully demonstrate that thanks to the Party and the government's concern and emphasis on sports, our country's sports are developing vigorously.
    This achievement is also inseparable from the selfless help of the Soviet Union, our elder brother, and from our learning from the advanced experiences of the Soviet Union. In weightlifting, I have personally experienced this.
    The National Weightlifting Test held in March 1955 was our country's first national weightlifting competition. At that time, the results were far from international standards. Later, we visited Moscow, and during the visit, we received enthusiastic help from Soviet experts Comrades Pustovoit and Osipov. They used their selfless and dedicated spirit to help us improve our techniques and improve our results. Chinese people are generally shorter, while Soviet people are generally taller. We have good leg strength, and they have good arm strength. In this situation, Soviet experts conducted research based on our physical characteristics, analyzed our movements, and used their rich experience to train us. They guided us to discover that our legs were very strong. In order to utilize our leg strength, they changed the snatch and clean and jerk split-style movements to squat-style. It is advantageous for people with great leg strength to use this method, so the results improved quickly. My clean and jerk result increased from ninety-five kilograms to one hundred and twenty kilograms. During the training process, the instructors often demonstrated personally to ensure that our movements were correct. An elderly instructor even used more than one hundred kilograms to demonstrate the snatch, which really made us feel bad. The instructors often thought about the movements with us, assisted us in competitions, and gave us muscle massages, sometimes being so busy that they didn't even have time to eat. Whenever we achieved new results, the instructors would happily hug us, kiss us, and congratulate us on our new achievements. When there were errors in our movements, they would seriously point out the shortcomings in the movements and ask us to correct them. Although we only stayed in Moscow for a short time, the results of our eight people improved by more than two hundred and seventy kilograms in total, catching up with the world level. On the day we left Moscow, the two instructors and their families personally went to the station to see us off. The instructors shook our hands, hugged us, and tears of enthusiasm flowed from their eyes. This scene will always remain in my mind.
    In 1956, in order to better help our country develop weightlifting, the Soviet Union sent experts Puskarev and Zhizhin to the Beijing Sports Institute to spread Soviet advanced weightlifting techniques to us, so I had the opportunity to receive the technical and planning assistance of the two experts, which enabled my results to be consolidated. Last May, the Soviet weightlifting team visited our country, giving me another good opportunity to learn. In the Sino-Soviet weightlifting friendship match held in Shanghai, the Soviet athletes enthusiastically encouraged me, hoping that I would break the world clean and jerk record created by the American lightweight weightlifter Vinci, and also told me to pay attention to correcting the shortcoming of leaning forward in the clean and jerk. This sincere friendship and encouragement increased my confidence and strength, and I finally created the world record for the lightweight clean and jerk with a result of one hundred and thirty-three kilograms. With the help of Soviet mentors, my results have been continuously improved. Subsequently, I created new world records for the lightweight clean and jerk with results of one hundred and thirty-five kilograms and one hundred and thirty-five point five kilograms. At this year's Sixth World Youth Festival and Third World Youth Friendship Games, we received even more meticulous help from Soviet instructors. Dunganov is a world-famous snatch record creator. He knew that our snatch technique was not good enough, so he came to help us improve our technique. Instructors Puskarev and Zhizhin worked day and night to prepare us for the competition. On August 6th, I went to compete with full confidence. Because my press and snatch results were not good enough, and I was a little nervous participating in such a large Games, I failed in the snatch during the competition. Famous Soviet instructor Koslev and other coaches immediately analyzed the reasons for my snatch failure, hoping that I could succeed in the next attempt. Because I was overly nervous and physically exhausted, my calves cramped during the warm-up for the final clean and jerk competition, which was a dangerous sign. When I thought about not being able to complete the task assigned to me by the people of the motherland, I couldn't calm down. In these decisive minutes, world record creator Vorobyov brought me a lot of salt and boiled water to eat so that my blood could circulate quickly and return to normal. At the same time, he encouraged me, "Be brave for your motherland." In this way, my spirit was revitalized. Although my legs hurt, I was still able to persevere and continue the competition. Finally, in the third clean and jerk, I lifted one hundred and forty kilograms, creating a new world record, and won the first place in the lightweight class, winning the first gold medal for the motherland in this Games. When the award was presented, I stood on the podium, watching the national flag of the motherland slowly rise amidst the majestic national anthem. I was so moved that I almost fainted. Without the help of the Soviet Union, our elder brother, how could I have achieved such results? I will work harder to learn from the Soviet comrades and create newer achievements for the motherland.

    友谊给了我力量

    伟大的苏联十月社会主义革命四十周年纪念日快要来临了，为了迎接这个伟大的节日，作为一个运动员，我愿在这里谈一谈苏联同志们几年来在举重方面对我们的帮助。
    1957年第六届世界青年联欢节期间举行的第三届青年友谊运动会，是一个规模宏大的运动会。参加这么大规模的运动会，我国还是第一次。在这届运动会中，我国运动员取得了一定的成就，我们举重队参加了七个人，取得了一个第一名，一个第二名，两个第四名，三个第六名，七人全部得分。这些成就，有力地证明由于党与政府对体育事业的关怀和重视，我国的体育运动事业有了蓬勃的发展。
    这个成就，同时也和苏联老大哥的无私帮助，以及我们学习了苏联的先进经验分不开的。在举重运动中，我亲身体会到这一点。
    1955年3月举行的全国举重测验，是我国第一次全国性的举重比赛。当时的成绩与国际水平比相差很远。后来我们访问了莫斯科，在访问期间，得到了苏联专家普斯特沃依特和奥西波夫两位同志热情的帮助。他们用大公无私和忘我的劳动精神，帮助我们改进技术、提高成绩。我国人身材一般比较矮，苏联人一般比较高大，我们的腿力好，他们的臂力好。在这种情况下，苏联专家根据我们的身体特点进行研究，分析我们的动作，用他们的丰富经验来训练我们。指导发现我们的两条腿很有力量，为了利用上我们的腿力，因此把抓举和挺举剪步式的动作改成下蹲式，腿力大的人取用这一方式是有利的，因此成绩提高很快。我的挺举成绩从九十五公斤提高到一百二十公斤。在训练过程中，指导为了使我们的动作正确，往往亲自作示范。一个上了年岁的指导，还用一百多公斤来作抓举的示范动作，真使我们过意不去。指导往往为了和我们思考动作，协助我们进行比赛，给我们作肌肉按摩，有时忙得连吃饭的时间都没有。每当我们出现新成绩的时候，指导便高兴地拥抱着我们，吻我们，祝贺我们的新成绩。在我们动作有错误的时候，便严肃地指出动作中的缺点，要我们改正。我们在莫斯科虽然只停留了一个短时间，但我们八个人的成绩，共提高了二百七十多公斤，赶上了世界水平。我们离开莫斯科的那一天，两位指导和家人亲自到车站送行，指导握着我们的手，拥抱着我们，眼睛里流下了热情的眼泪。这情景永远留在我的脑海中。
    1956年，苏联为了更好地帮助我国开展举重运动，派来了普斯卡列夫和日任两位专家到北京体育学院，把苏联的先进举重技术传播给我们，因此我有机会得到两位专家技术上和制定计划上的帮助，使我的成绩能够得到巩固。去年5月，苏联举重队到我国访问，使我又得到了一次良好的学习机会。在上海举行的中苏举重友谊赛中，苏联运动员热情的鼓励着我，希望我突破美国最轻量级举重运动员温奇所创造的世界挺举纪录，同时还告诉我要注意纠正挺举中重心倾前的缺点。这种真诚的友谊和鼓舞，使我增加了信心和力量，终于以一百三十三公斤的成绩创造了最轻量级挺举的世界纪录。在苏联导师的帮助下，我的成绩得到不断的提高。接着又以一百三十五公斤、一百三十五点五公斤的成绩创造出最轻量级挺举世界新纪录。在今年的第六届世界青年联欢节及第三届世界青年友谊运动会上，我们更得到苏联指导无微不至的帮助。杜加诺夫是世界有名的抓举纪录创造者，他知道我们的抓举技术不够好，因此特地来帮助我们改进技术。普斯卡列夫和日任几位指导，更是日夜不停地为我们作好比赛的准备。8月6日我满怀信心的去进行比赛。由于我推举、抓举的成绩不够好，同时参加这样大的运动会有些紧张，在比赛中抓举失败。有名的苏联指导科斯列夫等教练马上分析我抓举失败的原因，希望我在下一次试举中能得到成功。因为我过度紧张和身体疲劳，在进行最后一项挺举比赛做准备运动时，两小腿抽筋，这是一个危险的象征。我想到不能完成祖国人民交给我的任务的时候，我的心情怎么也不能平静下来，在这决定性的几分钟中，世界纪录创造者沃罗比耶夫同志拿来了很多食盐、开水给我吃，使我的血液能够很快流通，恢复正常。同时，他还鼓励我，“为了你们的祖国，勇敢些。”这样，我的精神重振起来，虽然腿痛，仍能坚持继续比赛，终于在第三次挺举中，举起了一百四十公斤，创造了新的世界纪录，并获得了最轻量级第一名，在本届运动会中，为祖国争得了第一枚金质奖章。发奖的时候，我站在发奖台上，看着祖国的国旗在雄壮的国歌声中徐徐上升，我感动得差一点晕过去。如果没有苏联老大哥的帮助，我怎能取得这样的成绩呢。我要更努力地向苏联同志学习，为祖国创造出更新的成绩。
