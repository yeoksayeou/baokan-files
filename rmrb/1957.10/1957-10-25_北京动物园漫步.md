    A Stroll Through the Beijing Zoo
    Dian Yi
    Flourishing Lions and Tigers
    Entering the zoo and heading east, in the three white glass bungalows of the "Small Animal Garden" resides a group of young lions and tigers of similar age. The older ones are already eight months old, while the two young South China tigers are only five months old. These young animals spend their days frolicking and playing. As soon as old zookeeper Wang Jingang enters with a basin of milk, they jump up and pounce on him, knocking him to the ground, then eagerly lap up the spilled milk. When the zookeeper picks up a smaller African lion named "Chun" and takes out fresh beef from his pocket, dipping it in the milk to feed it piece by piece, unfortunately, the other little ones discover it and swarm around, sweeping away the entire pocket of beef like a whirlwind. The zookeeper told the reporter that the zoo's lion and tiger breeding has been very successful this year, with twelve lion cubs and eleven tiger cubs surviving. In the past, it was very difficult to breed these large carnivores.
    Beasts of High Mountains and Dense Forests
    Two black rhinoceroses that recently arrived from Africa are living well in Beijing. Recently, two new neighbors have been added to their north – snow leopards and black panthers. Why are they called snow leopards? Because they live in the snowy mountains of southwestern China and can withstand the cold. Even in the harsh winter, they still live on mountains thousands of meters high. It would be ideal for northerners to have clothes made of snow leopard fur to keep them warm during the winter. The black panther has glossy black fur all over its body, a fierce temperament, and is alert and agile. Unlike snow leopards, black panthers live in the dense tropical forests of Malaya and India, often climbing to the highest trees to prey on apes and birds. People and animals passing through the forest must be careful to guard against surprise attacks by panthers lurking in the trees. The four little black panthers here were exchanged from Japan.
  “Four-Unlikes” Have Offspring
    In the deer park, where the sun is warm and the ground is covered with golden straw, a newly born, month-old Père David's deer, or "four-unlikes," is suckling its mother's milk. This strange animal originally lived in the Yellow River basin of China but was introduced abroad in 1900, and gradually became extinct domestically. Last year, the Zoological Society of London in England gave China four Père David's deer. Whether it is because the environment is suitable or because of the zookeepers' careful care, these two pairs of lucky creatures who returned to their homeland have not disappointed the people of the motherland and have quickly had offspring. In addition to the newborn calf, another female is about to give birth.
      The Fighting Mandrill
    After touring the zoo, I arrived at the panda pavilion. Several small monkeys have recently been exhibited in this pavilion. They often hide in the corners scratching themselves, so they don't attract much attention. But when they turn their faces, they will give you a start. On their deep red faces, there are blue patterns, their neck hair is very long, shimmering blue, but their tails are only two inches long. The guide said that these are mandrills exchanged from East Germany, not monkeys. Mandrills live in groups on the rocky mountains of Gambia, Senegal, and other places in West Africa. A mature male mandrill stands over four feet tall, weighs thirty kilograms, is agile, brave, and good at fighting, and dares to resist lions and leopards.
      Observations at the Breeding Farm
    In a row of red houses in the zoo's breeding farm, twenty-one adorable lesser pandas and one giant panda are raised. The zookeeper pushes in a cart of fresh bamboo, a rare sight in Beijing, and they quickly devour it, stems and leaves alike. This group of the world's rare animals was recently transported from Sichuan. After a period of immune isolation and rearing here, they will be exhibited in zoos in Beijing and other cities.
    The staff of the Beijing Zoo worked hard for two years, climbing mountains and wading through rivers in Sichuan, Qinghai, and other places, organizing local hunters to capture animals. This time, they brought back from Sichuan more than ten animals, including golden leopards, marmots, silver pheasants, fritillary chickens, longevity chickens, and Sichuan parrots. From Qinghai, they brought back nine animals, including lynx, wild donkeys, jackals, brown bears, hazel grouse, red deer, and argali sheep. The crystallization of Sino-Soviet friendship The rapid development of China's zoos in recent years is inseparable from the sincere help of the Soviet Union. This is what the person in charge of the Beijing Zoo told our reporter. He said that from 1952, when China and the Soviet Union established animal exchange relations, until September this year, the Soviet Union has transported to China forty-seven species and four hundred and twenty large animals, including the world's rare polar bears, pumas, European bison, zebras, and black swans. These animals have been exhibited in zoos, parks, and circuses in forty-seven cities across the country, including Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Shenyang, Harbin, Guangzhou, and Chengdu, playing a significant role in enriching the cultural life of the Chinese people and popularizing scientific knowledge. In addition, the zoos in Moscow, Leningrad, and Riga have continuously supplied scientific and technical materials on animal husbandry management and veterinary work.
    The director of the Moscow Zoo, Sasnovsky, and the veterinary director, Oleandreva, were invited to China from June to September 1954 to lecture and introduce the experience of the Soviet Union in zoo construction, animal husbandry management, and veterinary work. With their direct help, the Beijing Zoo began to establish an exhibition system from lower animals to higher animals and formulated a long-term construction plan. According to this plan, by 1962, the Beijing Zoo will be built into one of the largest zoos in the world.
    The person in charge also told reporters that on the eve of celebrating the fortieth anniversary of the great Russian October Socialist Revolution, the Soviet Union sent another batch of precious animals to our country: polar bears, Australian kangaroos, African baboons, emus, etc., which are about to arrive in Beijing.

    北京动物园漫步
    甸义
    狮虎兴旺
    入园往东，在“小动物园”的三间白色玻璃平房里，居住有一群年岁相当的幼狮和小虎。年纪大一点的已经八个月，两只小华南虎才只有五个月。这群幼小的动物终日嬉戏耍闹，老饲养员王金刚同志端着一盆牛乳刚走进去，就被它们跳起来扑打在地，然后争先恐后的去舐那撒在地上的牛乳。当饲养员把一只叫做“春”的较小的非洲狮抱在一旁，从口袋里取出鲜牛肉，沾着牛乳汁一块块的喂它的时候，不幸又被另几个小家伙发现，便一拥齐上，风卷残云般将一口袋牛肉打扫个净光。饲养员告诉记者今年动物园的狮虎繁殖得很兴旺，成活的就有十二只幼狮和十一只小虎，在过去这种大型肉食动物是很难繁殖的。
    高山密林中的猛兽
    不久前从非洲来的两只黑犀牛，在北京生活得很好。最近在它们的北面新添了两个邻居——雪豹和黑豹。为什么叫雪豹呢？因为它生活在我国西南部高山雪地里，能耐寒，即使在严冬季节，它们同样居住在数千公尺的高山上。北方人如果能够得到一件雪豹皮毛做的衣服过冬，是非常理想的事。黑豹周身皮毛黑亮亮的，性情凶猛，行动机警又灵活。黑豹和雪豹不同，是生活在马来亚和印度等热带的茂密丛林中，常攀缘到最高的树上，去捕食猿猴和鸟类，从林中经过的人和动物，要小心提防潜伏在树上的豹子的突袭。这里的四只小黑豹，是从日本交换来的。
  “四不像”有了后代
    在阳光融融，地下铺满黄金色稻草的鹿苑里，一只初生盈月的麋鹿“四不像”，正在吸吮着母乳。这种奇兽原来产在我国黄河流域，从1900年传到国外，国内逐渐绝种。去年英国伦敦动物学会送给中国四只麋鹿。不知是因为水土相符，还是饲养员的精心饲养，这两对重归故国的幸运儿没有辜负祖国人民的期望，很快就都有了后代。现在除了已经诞生的这头幼兽以外，另一头雌的又快要生仔了。
      善斗的山魈
    绕动物园逛了一圈便来到熊猫馆，这个馆里新近展出几只小猴子，它们常常躲在墙角搔痒，所以不大为人注意。可是当它们转过脸来就会吓人一跳，在那深红的脸上，长着一道道蓝色花纹，脖子毛很长，蓝蓝的闪耀发光，但是尾巴却只有二吋长。讲解员说这是从民主德国交换来的山魈，不是猴子。山魈成群结队的生活在西非洲的甘比亚、赛内加尔等地岩山上，一只成熟的雄山魈站起来有四尺多高，三十公斤重，身体灵活，勇敢善斗，遇到狮豹也敢于抵抗。
      饲养场见闻
    动物园饲养场的一排红房子里，饲养着二十一只可爱的小熊猫和一只大熊猫。饲养员推来一车北京少有的鲜嫩竹子，不一会便被它们连茎带叶分食净光。这批世界上稀有的动物是最近从四川运来的，在这里免疫隔离饲养一个时期以后，就将在北京和其他城市的动物园展览。
    北京动物园的工作人员在四川、青海等地，爬山涉水辛勤工作了两年，组织当地猎户捕捉动物。这次他们从四川运来的还有金钱豹、旱獭、银鸡、贝母鸡、寿鸡、四川鹦鹉等十多只动物。从青海运回的有猞猁、野驴、豺狼、马熊、马鸡、马鹿和石羊等九只动物。中苏友谊的结晶几年来我国动物园的迅速发展是和苏联的真诚帮助分不开的。这是北京动物园负责人对本报记者说的。他说，从1952年我国同苏联建立了动物交换关系起，到今年9月，苏联给我国运来了举世珍奇的北极白熊、美洲狮、欧洲野牛、斑马、黑天鹅等四十七种、四百二十只大型动物。这些动物已经分别在北京、上海、天津、沈阳、哈尔滨、广州、成都等全国四十七个城市的动物园、公园和马戏团中展出，对于丰富我国人民的文化生活和普及科学知识起了很大作用。此外，莫斯科、列宁格勒、里加等动物园，不断供给动物饲养管理和兽医工作等方面的科学技术资料。
    苏联莫斯科动物园主任萨斯诺夫斯基和兽医主任奥列安德烈娃，曾应邀在1954年6月到9月期间来我国讲学，介绍苏联的动物园建设、饲养管理和兽医工作的经验。在他们的直接帮助下，北京动物园开始建立了从低级动物到高级动物的展览体系，并制定了远景建设规划。根据这个规划，到1962年，北京动物园将建设成为世界上最大的动物园之一。
    这位负责人还告诉记者，在庆祝伟大的俄国十月社会主义革命四十周年的前夕，苏联送给我国的又一批珍贵动物：北极白熊、澳洲大袋鼠、非洲狒狒、鸸鹋等，就要运抵北京。（附图片）
