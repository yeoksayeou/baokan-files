Chinese Characters Must Be Reformed
Li Zhuchen

　　From the time I started recognizing and using Chinese characters until now, it has been seventy years at most, and sixty years at least. Over these decades, I have deeply felt that Chinese characters must be reformed, and the direction of reform must be toward pinyinization.

　　Chinese Characters Must Be Reformed

　　Our country is a large nation with a population of 600 million, with a long history and ancient culture, but the illiteracy rate accounts for more than 70% of the population. Naturally, the old society and the ruling class of the old society should bear the main responsibility for this. However, I believe that the fact that Chinese characters are not phonetic but ideographic is also one of the reasons.

　　There are many Chinese characters, and most of their structures are complex, making them difficult to remember and write. Looking back at how we recognized and wrote characters as children, and looking at the difficulties children face today when learning Chinese characters, shouldn't that arouse our sympathy? Remembering two thousand commonly used characters is quite a difficult task for both children and illiterate people. In a word, the biggest shortcomings of Chinese characters are that they are difficult to recognize, difficult to remember, and difficult to write, which affects the popularization and improvement of people's cultural education and is very unfavorable to socialist construction. Therefore, for the sake of the vast number of children and working people, Chinese characters must be reformed.

　　Although Chinese characters have such serious shortcomings as mentioned above, whenever the reform of Chinese characters is mentioned, some people always raise this and that reason, disagreeing or even firmly opposing it. For example, some people say, "Chinese characters are not difficult." In my opinion, these people are the same as those who "forget the pain once the wound is healed," forgetting the pain of learning the "Three Character Classic" and "Thousand Character Classic" in their early years. I think if these people could recall the pain they experienced when learning Chinese characters, and put themselves in the shoes of the two groups of people mentioned above, they might not disagree or firmly oppose it. It seems that discussing language reform also requires resolving the issue of stance first.

　　In the cause of building socialism, we demand that everything be done quickly and accurately, and that the degree of mechanization be improved as much as possible. But what do Chinese characters bring to printing, telegraphy, and typing? It is labor-intensive, time-consuming, and inefficient. Why? Isn't it still because it's not a phonetic script? I once thought: if someone calculated the time and manpower wasted each year in printing, telegraphy, and typing, the account would be quite alarming. This account will surely further make us realize the serious significance of language reform.

　　In the unprecedented unity of our country and the great unity of all ethnic groups, our minority brothers, in addition to using their own national languages and scripts, also need to learn the Han language and script as much as possible in order to communicate with the Han people. If Chinese characters remain unchanged, it will be very difficult for our minority brothers to learn them.

　　In addition, Chinese characters have also played a certain obstructive role in the cultural and scientific and technological exchanges between our country and other countries in the world. For example, some scientific terms that are commonly used internationally are transliterated into the national languages of many countries according to the original sound, but we have to create our own set. Similarly, if we translate our research results into foreign languages, difficulties will still arise. At first glance, this doesn't seem like a big problem. However, people in the scientific and engineering technology fields have found it very troublesome. From this, I think that in the future, should we appropriately or as much as possible translate some foreign words according to the original sound?

　　The Direction of Language Reform is Correct

　　Chinese characters must be reformed and follow the common phonetic direction of world languages. This is not only the urgent demand of the broad masses of people, but also the inevitable trend of the development of Chinese characters. However, language reform is a major issue that affects the entire nation's cultural life and involves all aspects of social life. Therefore, the reform must be carried out in a planned and step-by-step manner; we must not be overanxious and try to do two steps in one, nor should we be hesitant and conservative, and hesitate to move forward.

　　I believe that the current policy of "on the one hand, sorting out and simplifying Chinese characters, and on the other hand, promoting Mandarin, formulating and implementing phonetic alphabets, and carrying out research on phonetic writing" fully embodies the point of carrying out in a planned and step-by-step manner. We all know the evolution of Chinese characters. From the perspective of the number of strokes, it is basically from complex to simple. Before sorting out and simplifying Chinese characters, the masses created a large number of simplified characters and widely used them. This shows that people feel that Chinese characters are difficult to recognize, difficult to remember, and difficult to write, so they want to make them easier to recognize, easier to remember, and easier to write. This also shows that it is appropriate to adopt the principle of "established by common usage" in simplifying Chinese characters.

　　After the "Chinese Character Simplification Plan" was announced, some people were not very interested in it, saying, "I'm about to become illiterate." I think this kind of sigh and worry is unnecessary. Because simplified Chinese characters are "established by common usage," many characters, such as "办" (bàn), "边" (biān), "会" (huì), "丰" (fēng), "时" (shí), "党" (dǎng), etc., are already familiar to people. How can this "become illiterate"? Of course, some characters, such as "买" (mǎi), "尘" (chén), "币" (bì), "杂" (zá), etc., are somewhat difficult to recognize because some of them are cursive script converted into regular script, some are new uses of ancient characters, some are only commonly used in certain industries, and some are commonly used in certain regions. But as long as you use your brain a little, the problem will be solved, and you won't "become illiterate." For the sake of the broad masses of working people and millions of children, intellectuals should use their brains.

　　I like the simplification of "墾" (kěn), "犠" (xī), "醫" (yī), "竈" (zào), "繩" (shéng) to "垦" (kěn), "牺" (xī), "医" (yī), "灶" (zào), "绳" (shéng). I think the broad masses of working people and millions of children like them even more. The reason is obvious: these characters don't make people dizzy when they look at them, and they are simpler to write than in the past.

　　No matter how simplified Chinese characters are, they are not as good as phonetic scripts after all. However, due to the differences in our dialects, it is impossible to promote phonetic scripts in a relatively short period of a few years. But as long as we vigorously promote Mandarin, the conditions can be gradually met. When the vast majority of people across the country can speak Mandarin, how intimate it will be to use phonetic scripts to express our feelings, and how great the benefits it will bring to the cause of socialist construction! In this regard, I feel that the current publicity and promotion work is not done well enough. I heard that many Chinese language teachers in Beijing's middle schools have not yet learned Mandarin. I also often hear many people speaking dialects and local languages in institutions and public places. When talking about speaking Mandarin, people often say: "People who come to Beijing must change to speaking Beijing dialect when they get off the train. If they can't change it then, don't plan to change it later." The implication is that they are afraid of changing to a mixed accent and being laughed at. This kind of worry and conservative thinking is not conducive to the promotion of Mandarin and must be broken. Of course, not all those who don't speak Beijing dialect are due to this reason. For example, some people are used to speaking dialects, and they are not yet used to speaking Beijing dialect at first. For these people, we hope that they "get used to it."

　　In order to adopt phonetic scripts in the future, vigorously publicizing and promoting Mandarin is a matter of urgency. As for "formulating and implementing phonetic alphabets and carrying out research on phonetic writing," it is an indispensable preparation.

　　Crushing the Rightists' Vicious Attacks on Language Reform

　　In recent years, the government has done a lot of work in language reform and has achieved great results. I still clearly remember that in the former Government Administration Council in 1952, a Chinese Language Reform Research Committee was established under the Cultural and Educational Committee to organize experts to conduct research on simplifying Chinese characters and the Chinese pinyin scheme. In December 1954, the State Council decided to establish the Chinese Language Reform Committee to continue the research. The work done by these two committees in language reform over the years has been quite fruitful. This should be affirmed. In particular, it should be pointed out that the biggest advantage of the work of the two committees is that they have basically achieved relatively broad and in-depth discussions from top to bottom and from bottom to top on some major issues. Regarding this point, a review of Mr. Cao Bohan's article "Why Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji Made an Issue of Language Reform" in the "People's Daily" on June 30 will make it clear at a glance. I don't want to repeat it. So, why do right-wingers, such as Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji, make an issue of language reform and distort the facts? In my opinion, the reason is very simple: just because they are right-wingers.

　　We must fully expose and powerfully refute all right-wingers who attack language reform. Only by repelling the right-wingers' vicious attacks on language reform can language reform be carried out smoothly. Of course, there are still many specific issues in language reform. For these issues, we must continue to conduct extensive and in-depth discussions from top to bottom and from bottom to top. The more people who participate in research and discussion, the better the results of language reform will be. This is inevitable. I believe that language reform will be increasingly welcomed by the broad masses of people! I believe that language reform will achieve final victory step by step.

### 汉字必须改革

　　汉字必须改革
　　李烛尘
    我从认汉字和使用汉字到现在，多说有七十年，少说也有六十年。几十年来，我深深感到汉字必须改革，改革的方向必须是拼音化。
    汉字必须改革
    我国是一个六亿人口的大国，有着悠久的历史和古老的文化，可是文盲却占人口的70％以上。自然旧社会和旧社会的统治阶级对此要负主要责任。但是，汉字不是拼音文字而是表意文字，我认为这也是原因之一。
    汉字字数多，结构又多数是繁杂的，记和写都很困难。回想一下我们在儿童时期认字和写字的情形，再看看今天的儿童学习汉字的那种艰难情况，难道不应该引起我们的同情吗？记两千常用字，对儿童和文盲都是颇为艰巨的任务。一句话，汉字的最大缺点是难认、难记、难写，影响人民文化教育的普及与提高，对社会主义建设也是非常不利的。所以说，为广大的儿童和劳动人民着想，汉字必须改革。
    汉字虽然有上面这样严重的缺点，但是一提到汉字改革，总有些人提出这样、那样的理由，不同意甚至坚决反对。如有人说，“汉字并不难”。我看这样的人和“好了疮巴忘了痛”的人一样，忘记了当年初学“三字经”“千字文”时的痛苦了。我想这些人如果能回想一下当年自己学习汉字的痛苦，再设身处地为上两部分人的利益想想，也许不至于不同意或坚决反对。看来讨论文字改革，也同样要先解决立场问题。
    在建设社会主义的事业中，我们对一切事都要求做得迅速准确，并尽可能使其机械化程度提高。可是汉字在印刷、电报和打字等方面，带来的是什么？是费工、费时、效率低。为什么？不也还是因为它不是拼音文字的关系吗？我曾经这样想：如果有人在印刷、电报、打字这几方面把每年浪费的时间和人力算一笔账出来，那一定是相当惊人的。这一笔账，一定会更加促使我们认识文字改革的严重意义。
    在我们国家空前的统一和各民族大团结的情况下，我们的少数民族弟兄除了使用本民族的语言文字外，为了同汉族交往，也还需要尽可能地学习汉族的语言和文字。如果汉字仍是原封不动，少数民族的弟兄们学习起来困难是很多的。
    此外，汉字在我国与世界各国的文化交流和科学技术交流中，也起了某些阻碍的作用。例如：国际上通用的一些科学名词，许多国家是照原音译成本国文字，而我们必须单搞一套。同样，如果把我们研究的成果翻译成外文，困难照样出现。这一点，乍看来，好像问题不大。可是科学界和工程技术界的人们已感到很伤脑筋了。由此我想到，今后对一些外来语的吸收，是不是可以适当地或尽可能地按原音翻译。
    文字改革工作的方针是正确的
    汉字必须改革，要走世界文字共同的拼音方向，这不仅是广大人民的迫切要求，而且也是汉字发展的必然趋势。可是文字改革问题是一个影响整个民族文化生活的重大问题，是一个涉及社会生活各方面的复杂问题。因此，改革必须有计划、有步骤地进行；不能操之过急，两步并做一步走，也不能迟疑保守，踌躇不前。
    我认为，现在“一方面整理和简化汉字，另一方面推广普通话，拟定和推行拼音字母，进行拼音文字的研究工作”的方针，充分地体现了有计划、有步骤地进行这一点。我们都知道汉字的演变，从笔画的多少来看，基本上是由繁到简的。没有整理和简化汉字以前，群众就创造了大量的简化字，广泛地应用着。这说明人们都觉得汉字难认、难记、难写，因此要把它改得容易认、容易记、容易写些。这一点也说明了简化汉字采取“约定俗成”的原则是妥当的。
    “汉字简化方案”公布后，有人对它不怎么感兴趣，说什么“快变成文盲了”。我看这种感叹和顾虑是多余的。简化汉字因为是“约定俗成”，所以有很多字，如“办”“边”“会”“丰”“时”“党”等是人们早就熟悉的。这怎么会“变成文盲”？当然，有些字如“买”“尘”“币”“杂”等，因为有的是草书楷化，有的是古字新用，有的只在某个行业中通用，有的是在某个地区通用，认起来是有些困难。但只要稍微动动脑筋，问题也就解决了，不至于“变成文盲”。为了广大的劳动人民和千千万万的儿童，知识分子应该动动脑筋。
    我喜欢“墾”“犠”“醫”“竈”“繩”等字简化成“垦”“牺”“医”“灶”“绳”。我想广大的劳动人民和千千万万的儿童更加喜欢。道理很明显，这些字看了不叫人眼花缭乱，写起来比过去简单。
    汉字不论怎样简化，终究不及拼音文字。可是由于咱们的方言分歧，想在较短的几年内推行拼音文字是不可能的事。但只要大力地推广普通话，条件就能逐渐具备。全国各地的绝大多数人能说普通话了，那时用拼音文字一拼，表情达意该是多么亲切，给社会主义建设事业带来的好处该是多么巨大！在这方面，我觉得目前的宣传与推广工作做得是差了些。听说在北京的中学语文教师中就有很多人还没学普通话。在机关里和公共场所中我也常听到很多人操着方言土语。在谈到说普通话时，常有人说：“来北京的人要说北京话，必须下火车时就改，那时改不成，以后就别打算再改了。”言外之意是怕改得南腔北调，惹人家笑话。像这类的顾虑和保守思想，对推广普通话是不利的，必须打破。当然，没说北京话的，也不全是由于这个原因，如有人是说惯了方言，乍说北京话还不习惯。对这些人，我们希望他们“习惯”。
    为了将来采用拼音文字，大力宣传与推广普通话是当务之急。至于“拟定和推行拼音字母，进行拼音文字的研究工作”，更是必不可少的准备工作了。
    打击右派对文字改革的恶毒进攻
    几年来，政府在文字改革方面做了很多的工作，取得了很大的成绩。我还清楚的记得：在1952年前政务院的时候，在文化教育委员会之下就成立了中国文字改革研究委员会，组织专家进行简化汉字和汉语拼音方案的研究工作。1954年12月国务院又决定成立中国文字改革委员会继续进行研究。这两个委员会几年来在文字改革方面所做的工作，成绩是不小的。这是应该肯定的。特别应该指出的是，两会工作中的最大的优点是在一些重大问题上，基本上做到了自上而下和自下而上的比较广泛而深入的讨论。关于这一点查看“人民日报”6月30日曹伯韩先生所写“章伯钧、罗隆基为什么要在文字改革的题目上做文章”一文就可以一目了然。我不想再重复。那么，右派分子们，如章伯钧、罗隆基之流，为什么要在文字改革的题目上做文章，歪曲事实呢？我看原因很简单：就因为他们是右派。
    对于攻击文字改革的一切右派分子，我们必须给以充分的揭露，有力的驳斥。只有打退了右派分子对文字改革的恶毒进攻，文字改革才能顺利进行。当然，文字改革的具体问题还很多，对于这些问题，还必须继续自上而下和自下而上地进行广泛深入的讨论。参加研究和讨论的人越多，文字改革的成绩越好，这是必然的。我相信文字改革会越来越受到广大人民的欢迎！我相信文字改革会一步步地取得最后的胜利。
