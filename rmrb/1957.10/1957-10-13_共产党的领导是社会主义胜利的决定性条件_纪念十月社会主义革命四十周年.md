　　The experience of the October Revolution and Soviet construction not only proved that without the leadership of the Communist Party, the proletariat could not seize power and achieve victory in the socialist revolution, but also proved that after the working class established its own class dictatorship, during the transition period from capitalism to socialism, and in the cause of socialist construction, the leading role of the Communist Party must not be weakened under any circumstances.

　　Some people who are ignorant of the laws of social development think that the task of the proletarian dictatorship in the transition period can be achieved simply by issuing "a batch of the most revolutionary decrees and laws." In reality, the power of the working class, without the Communist Party as its pillar, without the Communist Party members who have close ties with the millions of masses as propagandists of policies and decrees, and leading the masses to fight for the implementation of the Party's and the state's policies and decrees with the spirit of self-sacrifice of bearing hardships first and enjoying comforts later, those "most revolutionary laws and decrees" will become empty talk. In the transition period, especially in its initial stage, the overthrown exploiting classes will not be reconciled to failure. They will always gather domestic and foreign counter-revolutionary forces and use the spontaneous capitalist tendencies of the petty bourgeoisie to continue their struggle against the proletariat. Therefore, the class struggle has not only not disappeared, but continues in other forms. The struggle between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat will continue for a long time, and the ideological struggle is even more tortuous and complex and will continue for an even longer period. Lenin said that the transition period is "a period of struggle between defeated but not yet eliminated capitalism and newly born but still very fragile communism" ("Economics and Politics in the Era of the Proletarian Dictatorship"). He also said: "The dictatorship of the proletariat is a persistent struggle, bloody and bloodless, violent and peaceful, military and economic, educational and administrative, against the forces and traditions of the old society." ("'Left-Wing' Communism: An Infantile Disorder"). Therefore, the idea that the proletariat can sit back and relax after seizing power is very dangerous. If the Communist Party does not carry out arduous work among the working class and the broad masses of the people, and lead them with the most resolute and thorough attitude to continue the struggle against the enemies of socialism to defend the socialist system, the dictatorship of the proletariat cannot be consolidated.

　　The state led by the working class not only has the task of suppressing the resistance of domestic exploiters and resisting the aggression of foreign imperialists, but also has to mobilize the broadest masses of working people, reorganize production according to socialist principles, change all sectors of life, and carry out extremely large-scale economic and cultural construction work. Some people think that socialist construction is different from class struggle. While class struggle certainly requires the leadership of the Party, economic and cultural construction does not necessarily require the Party to lead it. They do not know that economic and cultural construction under the conditions of the proletarian dictatorship is not something that can be carried out separately from class struggle. They also do not know that economic and cultural construction itself is not a purely technical work. Because, the question of which line to follow and which methods to adopt to carry out this construction is a very important question. In essence, it is the question of which line to follow and which methods to adopt to transform the world. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "The proletariat wants to transform the world according to its own world outlook, and the bourgeoisie also want to transform the world according to its own world outlook." The struggle between these two lines runs through all aspects of work during the period of the proletarian dictatorship, and also runs through economic and cultural construction. The victory or defeat of this struggle plays a decisive role in the success or failure of socialist construction.

　　Building a socialist society is a very arduous task. With the change of capitalist and individual ownership to socialist ownership, all sectors of life will undergo changes, which will cause resistance from the force of habit of operating in the manner of the petty bourgeoisie and the bourgeoisie, as Lenin said. This resistance must be overcome through a long and arduous struggle. Socialist construction is by no means a smooth process and will certainly experience many difficulties. The socialist relations of production are new relations of production that have never existed before, and they must go through a period of time after their emergence before they can consolidate themselves. Although the social productive forces under the socialist system can develop rapidly, they also need to go through a period of time before they can gradually meet people's needs. Foreign imperialists and counter-revolutionaries will always try their best to create difficulties for us, and socialist builders will also make some mistakes and losses in their work due to lack of experience. These situations will cause wavering among the petty-bourgeois masses who have not been completely transformed, and the wavering elements among the working masses will also express dissatisfaction, and the bourgeoisie will certainly use these difficulties to carry out their restoration activities. In the history of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Trotskyites launched an attack on the Party's general line in the 1920s. They denied the possibility of building socialism in one country, opposed the policy of national industrialization centered on the development of heavy industry, and advocated the use of methods of exploiting peasants to accumulate industrial funds - which was actually to oppose socialist industrialization by undermining the worker-peasant alliance. The Bukharin faction, on the other hand, protected the interests of the rich peasants by opposing state control over food and opposing agricultural collectivization. They were all attempting to push the socialist state back onto the capitalist path. These agents of the exploiting classes were only a very small number of people within the Party, but because they were supported by bourgeois and petty-bourgeois elements, bourgeois intellectuals, or wealthy strata among the peasants in society, they would form a considerable momentum within a certain period of time. The Trotskyites also used vicious tactics to attack the Party's leading organs, flattering the youth, saying that the old cadres had "degenerated" and that the Party's organs had become "bureaucratic," and attempting to usurp the Party's leadership. Only the advanced troops of the working class - the Communist Party - who have infinite loyalty to the cause of socialism can do this in order to repel this attack. The attack made by the Trotskyites in the early stage of Soviet industrialization was completely crushed in a great debate. The serious significance of this struggle is not difficult for the Chinese people, who have already victoriously defeated the bourgeois rightists, to understand.

　　The erroneous tendency of denying the Party's leading role in economic construction work appeared as early as 1921, that is, at the beginning of the period of restoring the national economy. The small group of the "Workers' Opposition" within the Party, which was resolutely criticized at the Tenth Congress of the Russian Communist Party, advocated handing over the leadership of organizing the national economy to the so-called "All-Russian Congress of Producers," and "having these producers elect the central organs for managing the national economy of the Republic." This program was actually to abolish the Party's leadership over the national economy. They used the trade union to oppose the Party and the state, and believed that the highest organizational form of the working class was not the Party but the trade union. Lenin severely refuted this syndicalist anarchist tendency. He pointed out that the concept of "producers" was not a class concept, but a concept that mixed the proletariat with non-proletarian laborers. Because "producers" included not only the proletariat, but also the semi-proletariat and small producers. This concept was completely divorced from the requirements of class struggle. Lenin believed that this kind of practice of "relying solely on non-Party masses" and "catering to non-Party masses" was fundamentally denying Marxism. He pointed out that this tendency was to completely abolish the Party's leading role over the proletarian trade unions and the proletariat's leadership and education work over the non-proletarian laboring masses.

　　The ideas of "relying solely on non-Party masses" and "catering to non-Party masses" that Lenin refuted here were essentially denying that the broad masses must be led by advanced troops in order to move forward. This is the ideology of the bourgeoisie and the petty bourgeoisie. The bourgeoisie always likes to deceive the masses with empty talk such as so-called "absolute democracy," and the anarchist tendencies of the petty bourgeoisie will echo this idea. They say: The Marxist-Leninist principle of the Party's leadership, the principle of the proletarian dictatorship, is essentially the "minority" leading the "majority," which is not "democratic" enough, is it? Lenin said in his speech at the Second Congress of the Communist International: "In fact, in the era of capitalism, the working masses suffer constant exploitation and cannot develop their human abilities. At this time, the greatest characteristic of the workers' party is that it can only include a minority of the working class. The party can only unite a minority of the class, just as in all capitalist societies, truly class-conscious workers only constitute a minority of the entire workers. Therefore, we have to admit that only this class-conscious minority can lead the broad masses of workers and make them follow them." He also said: "What is an organized minority? If this minority is truly class-conscious, if this minority is good at leading the masses and making them follow them, if this minority can answer every question on the agenda, then this minority is essentially a party." ("The Role of the Communist Party"). Here in our country, there are also many rightists who fundamentally deny that people have advanced, intermediate, and backward components, deny that people must be led by advanced components in order to move forward, and advocate that the Communist Party should not lead the masses, but should be led by the masses. In reality, the trick of "the majority should lead the minority" that they are playing is nothing more than to abolish the leadership of the Communist Party. They know that as long as the leadership of the Communist Party is abolished, the proletarian regime and the socialist cause will collapse, and the restoration of the bourgeoisie will not be difficult.

　　In the history of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, we can see that all enemies of socialism will try their best to attack the leadership of the Communist Party. In order to achieve this goal, they also put on the sheepskin of "socialism" to cover up their essence as exploiters. The counter-revolutionary rebels of Kronstadt in 1921 put forward the slogan of supporting the Soviets, but "Soviets without the participation of Communists." This is as absurd as the saying of our country's rightists that "without the leadership of the Communist Party, people will also take the socialist road." In addition, the methods of the bourgeois rightists to oppose and weaken the leading role of the Communist Party are varied. They say something like "The Communist Party only needs to carry out political leadership, not organizational leadership, because organizational leadership will produce bureaucracy." This fallacy is actually just to persuade the working class to hand over its own regime. They say something like: "Laymen cannot lead experts," "The Communist Party can lead political and economic work, but cannot lead scientific work." May I ask whether the high degree of development of Soviet science, including many aspects of natural science and technology science (such as the recent successful test of artificial earth satellites and intercontinental missiles), has not been achieved under the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union? Therefore, the Communist Party should lead all work, and the Communist Party can lead all work well. Of course, the Party must work hard to learn, and should never be content to be a layman at any time. In addition, the Party's leadership we are talking about mainly refers to the fact that the Party can point out the correct direction for all work, and provide various guarantees from the organizational work. It does not mean that the Party must interfere in some technical details. That kind of practice is just a vulgarized understanding of the Party's leading role, and it is not what we want to advocate.

　　In short, the leading role of the Communist Party must not be weakened, especially under the conditions of the proletarian dictatorship. Lenin said in the draft resolution on syndicalism and anarchism tendencies within the Party, drafted for the Tenth Congress of the Russian Communist Party: "...The sum of the experiences of the revolutions of the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries shows with the greatest clarity and certainty that the slightest weakening of the unity, strength, and influence of the proletariat's vanguard can only promote the restoration of the power of the capitalists and landlords and their private ownership as a result of this wavering." He also said that this weakening of the Communist Party's leading line is actually helping the enemies of the proletarian revolution. We can clearly see that the reason why the counter-revolutionary restoration in Hungary last year was able to occur was inseparable from the weakening of the leading role of the working class party.

　　Without the leadership of the Communist Party, there would be no victory for socialism. This basic experience that the October Revolution and Soviet socialist construction have contributed to the working class of the world is something that all those who sincerely support the socialist road must never forget. Marx said, "Whether human thinking has objective truth is not a theoretical question, but a practical question." The universal truth of Marxism-Leninism, including its doctrine on establishing a political party of the vanguard of the working class, its objective truthfulness, has been confirmed by a large amount of irrefutable practical experience of the international workers' movement on the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution. The socialist system, which won victory in one country on earth forty years ago, has not only won victory within the scope of more than one-third of the earth's population today, but also the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, composed of these countries, has become a strong fortress for defending world peace, and prevents the conspiracy of American imperialism to launch wars to enslave the people of the whole world from succeeding. All these socialist-type countries are led by Marxist-Leninist parties composed of advanced troops of the working class. Communists are the backbone of these countries, and the leaders, inspirers, and organizers of the socialist cause of these countries. It is precisely because the Communist Party is the faithful defender of the interests of the people, and the Communist Party has no other interests except the interests of the people, that it has gained the trust and support of the increasingly broad masses of the people, and more and more conscious advanced elements of the working class have joined its ranks. Now, in almost all countries in the world, there are organizations of Marxist-Leninist parties, and the total number of its members has reached more than 30 million.

　　The road of the October Revolution is the road to the complete liberation of the working people of the world. The great historical process of the forty years since the October Revolution has fully proved that the Marxist-Leninist doctrine of party building and its entire doctrine are invincible. The banner of the October Revolution will continue to lead us to advance victoriously. (To be continued)

　　共产党的领导是社会主义胜利的决定性条件
    纪念十月社会主义革命四十周年
　　许立群
    十月革命和苏联建设的经验，不仅证明了没有共产党的领导，无产阶级就不能够夺取政权，取得社会主义革命的胜利，而且证明了在工人阶级建立了自己的阶级专政之后，在从资本主义到社会主义的过渡时期里，在社会主义建设事业中，共产党的领导作用，仍然是绝对不能削弱的。
    有些对社会发展规律无知的人，以为无产阶级专政在过渡时期里的任务，只要发布“一批最革命的法令和法律”就可以达到了。实际上，工人阶级的政权，如果没有共产党作为它的支柱，没有和千百万群众有着密切联系的共产党员作为政策法令的宣传者，并且以吃苦在前享乐在后的自我牺牲精神，率领群众为执行党和国家的政策法令而奋斗，那些
  “最革命的法律和法令”也会变成空谈。在过渡时期、特别是它的初期，被打倒的剥削阶级并不会甘心失败，他们总要收集国内外的反革命力量，并且利用小资产阶级的自发资本主义倾向，来继续向无产阶级作斗争。所以，阶级斗争不仅没有消灭，而是采取另外的形式继续着。资产阶级和无产阶级之间的斗争，会继续到一个很长的时期，而意识形态之间的斗争，是更曲折而复杂的，会继续到更长的时期。列宁说，过渡时期是“已被打败、但还未被消灭的资本主义与已经诞生、但还非常脆弱的共产主义彼此斗争的时期”。（“无产阶级专政时代的经济和政治”）他又说：“无产阶级专政是为反对旧社会势力及其传统而进行的坚持的斗争，流血的与不流血的，强力的与和平的，军事的与经济的，教育的与行政的斗争。”（“共产主义运动中的‘左派’幼稚病”）因此，那种认为无产阶级只要取得了政权就可以高枕无忧的想法，是十分危险的。如果没有共产党在工人阶级和广大人民群众当中进行艰苦的工作，并以最坚决彻底的态度领导他们向社会主义的敌人继续作斗争来保卫社会主义制度，无产阶级专政就不能够巩固。
    工人阶级所领导的国家，不只有镇压国内剥削者的反抗和抵抗外国帝国主义者侵略的任务，它还要动员最广大的劳动群众，按照社会主义的原则来改组生产，改变生活的一切部门，进行规模极其巨大的经济文化建设工作。有的人以为，社会主义建设工作，毕竟和阶级斗争不同，阶级斗争固然需要党的领导，但经济文化建设却并不一定要党来领导了。他们不知道无产阶级专政条件下的经济文化建设工作，并不是什么可以脱离阶级斗争而单独进行的事情。他们也不知道经济文化建设工作本身，并不是什么单纯技术性的工作。因为，按照什么路线、采用什么方法来进行这种建设，是个十分重要的问题，这实质上就是按照什么路线、采用什么方法来改造世界的问题。毛泽东同志说：“无产阶级要按照自己的世界观改造世界，资产阶级也要按照自己的世界观改造世界。”这两条路线的斗争，贯串在无产阶级专政时期的各方面工作中，也贯串在经济文化建设工作中。这一斗争的胜负对于社会主义建设的成败，是起着决定作用的。
    建设社会主义社会是一件十分艰巨的事情。随着资本主义所有制和个体所有制到社会主义所有制的改变，生活的一切部门都要发生改变，这就会引起列宁说的惯于按照小资产阶级和资产阶级方式经营的习惯势力的抵抗，这种抵抗，必须经过长期而艰苦的斗争才能克服。社会主义建设绝不是一帆风顺的过程，而一定会经历许多的困难。社会主义的生产关系是从未有过的新的生产关系，它在产生以后，必须经过一个时期才能使自己巩固起来。社会主义制度下的社会生产力虽然能够有迅速的发展，但也须要经过一个时期，才能逐步做到满足人们的需要。外国帝国主义和反革命分子总要千方百计地为我们制造困难，而社会主义建设者由于还缺少经验，也会在工作中造成某些错误和损失。这些情况都会引起尚未彻底改造的小资产阶级群众中的动摇，工人群众中的不坚定分子也会表示不满，而资产阶级当然要利用这种困难来进行他们的复辟活动。苏联共产党内在二十年代曾经发生过托洛茨基分子向党的总路线的进攻，他们否认一国建成社会主义的可能性，反对以发展重工业为中心的国家工业化的方针，主张采用剥削农民的方法来积累工业资金——实际上也就是用破坏工农联盟的办法来反对社会主义工业化。布哈林分子则是从反对国家对粮食的统制、反对农业合作化的方面来保护富农的利益。他们都是企图把社会主义国家推回到资本主义的轨道上面去。这些剥削阶级的代理人，在党内只是极少数人，但是他们因为得到社会上资产阶级小资产阶级分子、资产阶级知识分子或农民中富裕阶层的支持，就会在一个时间内形成不小的声势。托洛茨基分子还用恶毒的手法进攻党的领导机关，向青年献媚，说老干部“蜕化”了，党的机关已经“官僚主义化”了等等，企图篡夺党的领导。要击退这种进攻，也只有对社会主义事业抱有无限忠心的工人阶级先进部队——共产党才能作到。托洛茨基分子在苏联工业化初期所作的这种进攻，在一场大辩论当中完全被粉碎了。这一场斗争的严重意义，对于已经胜利地击败了资产阶级右派分子的中国人民，是并不难于理解的。
    否认经济建设工作中党的领导作用的错误倾向，早在1921年，也即在恢复国民经济时期开始的时候就出现了。在俄共第十次代表大会上遭到坚决批判的党内的“工人反对派”的小集团，主张把组织国民经济的领导权，交给所谓“全俄生产者代表大会”，并“由这些生产者选出管理共和国全国民经济的中央机关”。这个纲领，实际上就是取消党对国民经济的领导。他们用职工会来和党与国家对立，认为工人阶级的最高组织形式不是党而是职工会。列宁严厉驳斥了这种工团主义的无政府主义倾向，他指出所谓“生产者”的概念不是一个阶级的概念，而是一个把无产阶级和非无产阶级劳动者混同起来的概念。因为，“生产者”既包括了无产阶级，还包括了半无产阶级和小生产者。这个概念，是完全离开阶级斗争的要求的。列宁认为这种“专靠非党群众”、“逢迎非党群众”的作法，是根本否认马克思主义。他指出这种倾向是要把党对无产阶级职工会的领导作用，把无产阶级对非无产阶级劳动群众的领导教育工作完全取消。
    列宁在这里所驳斥的“专靠非党群众”和“逢迎非党群众”的思想，实质上也就是否认广大群众必须由先进部队领导才能前进。这是资产阶级和小资产阶级的思想。资产阶级总是喜欢用所谓“绝对民主”之类的空谈来欺骗群众，而小资产阶级的无政府主义倾向，就会对这种思想加以附和。他们说：马克思列宁主义关于党的领导作用的原理，无产阶级专政的原理，实质上是“少数”领导“多数”，这岂非太不“民主”了么？列宁曾在共产国际第二次大会的演讲中说：“事实上，在资本主义时代，工人群众遭受不断的剥削，而不能发挥他们的人的能力，这时工人政党底最大特征，正是它只能包括工人阶级底少数。政党只能联合阶级底少数，正如在一切资本主义社会里面，真正有阶级觉悟的工人只构成全体工人底少数一样。因此，我们不得不承认，只有这个有阶级觉悟的少数才能领导广大的工人群众，使他们跟着自己走”。他又说：“什么是有组织的少数呢？假如这个少数是真正有阶级觉悟的，假如这个少数善于领导群众跟着自己走，假如这个少数能答复每一个摆在日程上的问题，那末，这个少数在本质上说就是一个政党。”（“共产党的作用”）在我们这里也有不少右派分子，他们根本否认人群有先进、中间和落后之分，否认人群必须由先进部分来领导才能够前进，并且主张共产党不应该领导群众，而是应该由群众来领导共产党。实际上，他们所玩弄的“多数应该领导少数”的把戏，也无非是为了取消共产党的领导。他们知道，只要把共产党的领导取消了，无产阶级的政权和社会主义事业就会瓦解，资产阶级的复辟就不困难了。
    在苏联共产党的历史上，我们可以看到，一切社会主义的敌人总要千方百计地来进攻共产党的领导。为了达到这个目的，他们还披上了“社会主义”的羊皮，来掩盖自己的剥削者的本质。1921年的喀琅施塔德的反革命叛乱分子，提出拥护苏维埃、但是“不要共产党人参加的苏维埃”的口号，这和我国的右派分子提出的“没有共产党的领导，人们也会走社会主义道路”，是同样荒谬的。此外，资产阶级右派分子反对和削弱共产党的领导作用的手法，是多种多样的。他们说什么“共产党只要进行政治领导，不要进行组织领导，因为有了组织领导就会产生官僚主义”。这种谬论实际上就是劝诱工人阶级交出自己的政权罢了。他们说什么：“外行不能领导内行”，“共产党可以领导政治经济方面的工作，但是不能领导科学工作”。试问苏联科学的高度发展，连同自然科学和技术科学的许多方面（如最近人造地球卫星和洲际导弹的试验成功）在内，都大大超过美国，难道不是在苏联共产党领导之下所获得的么？因此，共产党是应该领导一切工作的，而且，共产党是能够把一切工作领导好的。自然，党必须努力学习，任何时候也不应该安于当外行。另外，我们所说的党的领导，主要是就党能够给一切工作指出正确的方向，并且从组织工作上给以各种保证而言，并不是认为党对一些技术性的细节问题都要加以干涉。那种作法只不过是对党的领导作用庸俗化的理解，不是我们所要提倡的。
    总之，共产党的领导作用是绝对不能削弱的，在无产阶级专政的条件下就尤其如此。列宁在为俄共第十次代表大会起草的关于党内工团主义与无政府主义倾向的决议草案中说：“……十八、十九与二十世纪各次革命的经验总和，却万分明显和万分确凿地表明出，无产阶级先锋队底统一性、力量和影响若受到丝毫削弱，则这种动摇的结果，便只能促成资本家地主政权及其私有制的复辟。”他又说，这种对共产党领导路线之削弱，实际上是帮助无产阶级革命的敌人。我们清楚地看到：去年匈牙利反革命复辟之所以能够发生，和工人阶级政党领导作用的削弱是分不开的。
    没有共产党的领导作用，就没有社会主义的胜利。十月革命和苏联社会主义建设所贡献给全世界工人阶级的这一项基本经验，是一切真心拥护社会主义道路的人们绝对不能忘记的。马克思说过，“人的思维是否具有客观的真确性，这个问题并不是理论的问题，而是实践的问题”。马克思列宁主义的普遍真理，包括它的关于建立工人阶级先锋队的政党的学说，其客观真理性，在纪念十月革命四十周年的今天，已经被大量的、不可辩驳的国际工人运动的实践经验所证实了。四十年前在地球上的一个国度里取得胜利的社会主义制度，今天不仅在地球上三分之一以上的人口的范围内取得了胜利，而且，由这些国家所组成的以苏联为首的社会主义阵营，已经成为保卫世界和平的坚强堡垒，并且使得美国帝国主义发动战争来奴役全世界人民的阴谋不能得逞了。所有这些社会主义类型的国家，都是由工人阶级先进部队所组成的马克思列宁主义的政党所领导的。共产党人是这些国家的脊梁，是这些国家社会主义事业的领导者、鼓舞者和组织者。正因为共产党是人民利益的忠实保卫者，共产党除了人民的利益以外没有任何其它的利益，因此，它就获得日益广大的人民群众的信任和支持，并且有愈来愈多的、有觉悟的工人阶级先进分子参加了它的行列。现在，几乎在全世界一切国家里，都有了马克思列宁主义政党的组织，它的成员总数已经达到三千万人以上。
    十月革命的道路是全世界劳动人民彻底解放的道路。十月革命以来四十年间的伟大历史进程已经充分证明，马克思列宁主义的建党学说和它的全部学说都是不可战胜的。十月革命的旗帜将继续领导着我们胜利地前进。（续完）
