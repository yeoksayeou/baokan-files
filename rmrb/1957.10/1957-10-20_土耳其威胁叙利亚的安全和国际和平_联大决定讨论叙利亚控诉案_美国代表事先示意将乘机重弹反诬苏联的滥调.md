Xinhua News Agency, October 19th: New York Dispatch: The United Nations General Assembly, on the 18th, voted 66 to 0, with one abstention (Liberia), to include Syria's complaint against Turkey on the agenda, and decided to hold a General Assembly debate next week. The title of Syria's complaint is "Complaint Regarding Threats to the Security of Syria and to International Peace."

The President of the General Assembly, Australia's Sir Leslie Munro, announced at the adjournment of the meeting that the Assembly would convene on "an appropriate date next week" to discuss the issue.

Before the Assembly made this decision, the General Committee, which met earlier that afternoon, unanimously recommended that the Assembly discuss Syria's complaint.

At the General Committee meeting, Syria's representative, Foreign Minister Bitar, presented arguments for including the issue on the agenda of the United Nations General Assembly. He emphasized that before appealing to the United Nations General Assembly, Syria had exhausted all means to ease tensions through negotiations with Turkey. The Syrian representative drew attention to the fact that the concentration of Turkish troops on the Syrian border, the wave of slander against Syria, and the subversive activities carried out by certain foreign countries against Syria, were all components of a comprehensive conspiracy to undermine Syria's security and independence. He said that these actions had reached the point where there was a danger of military conflict.

Turkey's representative, Esin, spoke against Syria's complaint. He insisted that Turkey seemed to be "warmly sympathetic to Syria," but he did not refute the fact that Turkish troops were massing on the Syrian border and other evidence of aggression against Syria.

Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko supported Syria's request to include the complaint on the agenda. He also reminded everyone that the President of the Assembly had delayed convening the General Committee for two days and nights, despite the letters from the Syrian and Soviet delegations emphasizing the urgency of the issue.

U.S. Representative Lodge supported Turkey's position, but said he would not oppose including the item proposed by Syria on the Assembly's agenda. He hinted to the committee that his delegation intended to use the discussion of this issue to repeat American slanderous propaganda, implying that the tension in the Near East was caused by the Soviet Union. Lodge proposed changing the name of the item to "Threats to the Independence and Security of Syria and to International Peace" in order to make it easier to direct the Assembly's discussion toward the direction of American conspiracies.

The representatives of Britain and France also did not express opposition to including this item on the agenda, but they stated that their doing so did not imply agreement with Syria's complaint against Turkey.

The representatives of Czechoslovakia, Ceylon, Tunisia, Iran, and other countries supported Syria's request.

Syrian representative Bitar spoke again at the end. He opposed any modification of the name of Syria's complaint by the American representative. Due to Syria's opposition, the U.S. representative had to withdraw his suggestion.

    土耳其威胁叙利亚的安全和国际和平
    联大决定讨论叙利亚控诉案
    美国代表事先示意将乘机重弹反诬苏联的滥调
    据新华社19日讯  纽约消息：联合国大会全体会议18日以六十六票对零票，一票（利比里亚）弃权，通过把叙利亚对土耳其的控诉案列入议程，并且决定在下星期举行大会辩论。叙利亚提出的控诉案的名称是“关于叙利亚的安全和国际和平所受到的威胁的控告”。
    大会主席、澳大利亚的孟罗在宣布大会休会的时候说，大会将在“下周适当的日期”召开，讨论这个问题。
    在大会作出这个决定以前，当天下午早些时候举行的总务委员会已以一致票建议大会对叙利亚控诉案进行讨论。
    在总务委员会会议上，叙利亚代表、外交部长比塔尔提出了关于要求把这个问题列入联合国大会议程的论据。他强调指出，在向联合国大会要求以前，叙利亚曾经采用一切办法，企图通过同土耳其谈判的途径来缓和紧张局势。叙利亚代表提请注意，土耳其军队在叙利亚边境集结、掀起诬蔑叙利亚的浪潮以及某些外国对叙利亚进行的颠覆活动，所有这些都是破坏叙利亚安全和独立的全部阴谋的组成部分。他说，这种行动已经达到了有发生军事冲突的危险。
    土耳其代表艾辛发言反对叙利亚的控诉。他硬说土耳其似乎是“热烈地同情叙利亚”的，但是他没有反驳土耳其军队在叙利亚边境集结以及其他证明侵犯叙利亚的事实。
    苏联外交部长葛罗米柯支持叙利亚关于把控诉案列入议程的要求。他还提醒大家注意，大会主席把召开总务委员会一事拖延了两昼夜，尽管叙利亚代表团的信件和苏联代表团的信件都强调指出了这一问题的紧急性。
    美国代表洛奇支持土耳其的态度，但他表示不反对把叙利亚所提的项目列入大会议程。他向委员会示意，他的代表团企图利用对这个问题的讨论来重复美国的诽谤宣传，似乎近东的紧张局势是由苏联引起的。洛奇提议把这个项目的名称改变一下，改为“对叙利亚的独立和安全以及对国际和平的威胁”，以便使它更易于把大会的讨论导向美国阴谋的方向。
    英国和法国的代表也没有表示反对把这一项目列入议程，但是他们说明，他们这样作并不意味着同意叙利亚对土耳其的控诉。
    捷克斯洛伐克、锡兰、突尼斯、伊朗和其他国家的代表支持叙利亚的请求。
    叙利亚代表比塔尔最后再次发言。他反对美国代表对叙利亚控诉案的名称作任何修改。由于叙利亚的反对，美国代表不得不收回了他的建议。
