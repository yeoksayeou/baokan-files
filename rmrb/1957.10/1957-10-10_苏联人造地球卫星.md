Soviet Artificial Earth Satellite
Soviet "Pravda" Editorial Department

On October 4, 1957, a major event occurred in the world: the Soviet Union successfully launched the first artificial Earth satellite. The news of the satellite's launch spread to every corner of the world. Many people on all continents observed the satellite passing overhead. The creation of the artificial satellite is the result of long-term, painstaking research and design by a large number of Soviet scientists, engineers, and industrial workers.

As early as the beginning of the 20th century, the outstanding Russian scientist Tsiolkovsky had theoretically solved the problem of launching spacecraft outside the Earth's atmosphere, proving that the tool for interstellar flight should be a rocket. Tsiolkovsky's works studied a series of important issues related to interstellar flight and pointed out that building an artificial Earth satellite was the first necessary stage.

Building an artificial Earth satellite required solving a series of extremely complex and completely new scientific and technological problems. The greatest difficulty was designing the rocket to launch the artificial satellite into orbit. To launch the artificial satellite, a structurally perfect rocket was created, a powerful engine operating under extremely high-temperature conditions was created, the optimal conditions for rocket motion were studied, and it was ensured that the rocket could be used most effectively. To launch the satellite into orbit, the rocket had to have a specified motion law. To ensure this specified motion law, a very precise and effective automatic rocket control system was designed.

These problems, and many other extremely difficult problems, were solved by applying the latest achievements in various fields of science and technology, and primarily due to the high technical level of Soviet rocket manufacturing. The high level of our country's scientific and technological potential, and the precise and organized work of scientific research institutions, design bureaus, and industrial enterprises, ensured that artificial Earth satellites could be manufactured in such a short period.

Before the artificial satellite was launched, a large amount of experimental work was also carried out to create and adjust individual equipment and the entire system. The successful launch of the artificial satellite fully confirmed that the calculations and basic technologies adopted in the manufacture of the carrier rocket and the artificial satellite were completely correct.

The launch of the first satellite is the beginning of a broad scientific research program. During the International Geophysical Year, this program will continue to be implemented using a series of artificial satellites launched in succession, and the weight and volume of these artificial satellites will be further increased. Manufacturing artificial satellites is the first step in conquering interstellar space and realizing space flight.

The artificial satellite is spherical. It is placed at the front end of the carrier rocket and sealed with a conical protective cover. The rocket carrying the artificial satellite is launched vertically. Within a short time after launch, relying on the designed structure, the rocket's axis begins to gradually deviate from the vertical line. At the final moment of entering the orbit, the rocket is located at a height of several hundred kilometers, moving parallel to the Earth's surface at a speed of approximately eight kilometers per second. After the rocket engine finishes working, the conical protective cover is detached, and the artificial satellite leaves the rocket and begins to operate independently.

Currently, orbiting the Earth is an artificial satellite loaded with instruments, as well as the rocket and the conical protective cover. Because the speed at which the protective cover separates from the artificial satellite and the artificial satellite separates from the rocket is not high, the rocket and the protective cover remain close to the artificial satellite for a period of time, orbiting the Earth along orbits similar to that of the artificial satellite. Subsequently, due to the difference in the relative speed at the time of separation and the degree of atmospheric resistance, the three objects disperse, and during the continued operation, they will appear at completely different points on the Earth's surface at the same time.

Satellite Orbit

The satellite's orbit is close to elliptical, with one of the ellipse's foci at the center of the Earth. The satellite's altitude from the ground is not fixed but changes periodically, reaching nearly 1,000 kilometers at its highest point. Currently, the orbit's perigee (its lowest point) is in the Northern Hemisphere, while the apogee (the highest point of the orbit) is in the Southern Hemisphere.

The plane of the orbit is almost fixed with respect to the stars. Because the Earth rotates, the satellite should appear above other regions each time it revolves, shifting approximately twenty-four degrees of longitude per revolution. The actual shifted longitude will be slightly larger because the plane of the orbit will slowly rotate around the Earth's axis in the opposite direction to the Earth's rotation due to the deviation of the gravitational field from the center. This movement of the orbital plane is not large, approximately four degrees of longitude per revolution. Due to the relative motion of the Earth and the orbital plane, the satellite will be approximately 1,500 kilometers west of the latitude of Moscow for every revolution, which is eleven times. The displacement is larger in the equatorial region, about 2,500 kilometers.

The angle of inclination between the orbital plane and the Earth's equatorial plane is sixty-five degrees. Therefore, the artificial satellite's orbit passes over regions roughly between the Arctic and Antarctic circles. Due to the Earth's rotation around its axis, the angle of inclination between the orbit and the equator is not the same as the angle of inclination of the orbital plane. When flying to the Northern Hemisphere, the orbit crosses the equator at an angle of 71.5 degrees to the northeast. Then the orbit gradually turns east, touching the 65 degrees north latitude line and deviating south, and then crosses the equator at an angle of 59 degrees to the southeast. In the Southern Hemisphere, the orbit touches the 65 degrees south latitude line, then deviates north and passes through the Northern Hemisphere again.

As time passes, due to the resistance encountered by the artificial satellite in the upper atmosphere of the Earth, the shape and size of the satellite's orbit will gradually change. Because the density of the atmosphere is extremely low at the high altitudes where the satellite operates, the evolution of the orbit will initially be slow. The height of the apogee will decrease more rapidly than the height of the perigee, so the orbit will become closer and closer to circular. When the artificial satellite enters a denser atmosphere, the resistance it encounters becomes extremely strong. The satellite will burn up, similar to a meteor falling from space into the Earth's atmosphere.

Currently, our understanding of the density of the upper atmosphere is not precise enough. Therefore, it is temporarily impossible to accurately predict how long the artificial satellite will remain in orbit. Based on the currently available data on the density of the upper atmosphere and the results of measuring the orbit, it is certain that the artificial satellite will orbit the Earth for a long period.

The current orbital period of the artificial satellite is 96 minutes. As the orbit lowers, the period will shorten accordingly. The rate of change of the period will be a sign of the rate of change of the orbit's shape. Therefore, accurately measuring the orbital period of the artificial satellite is an extremely important task.

The orbital parameters of the Soviet artificial satellite make it possible to observe the satellite within a large range of latitudes on all continents. This opens up wide possibilities for solving various scientific problems. It can be pointed out that launching a satellite into this orbit is more difficult than launching a satellite into an orbit close to the equatorial plane. When launching a satellite along the equator, it is possible to use the speed of the Earth's rotation around its axis to a large extent to accelerate the carrier rocket's flight speed.

Observation of Satellite Operation

A very important component of the research conducted with artificial Earth satellites is observing the satellite's operation, studying the observation results, and inferring the satellite's continued operation based on the research results. Observing the satellite can be done with radio equipment or with optical instruments in observatories. In addition to experts observing with their equipment, radio enthusiasts and astronomy enthusiasts are also widely recruited to observe at observatories with dedicated optical instruments. Currently, the Soviet Union has sixty-six optical observation stations and twenty-six clubs of the Voluntary Association for Assistance to the Army, Navy, and Air Force that regularly observe the satellite with a large number of radio observation devices. In addition, there are tens of thousands of radio enthusiasts who observe the satellite individually.

Scientific stations use radar and radio direction finders for observation. Optical methods are also used for observation, and the satellite's operation is photographed.

Let's talk about the observation methods of astronomy enthusiasts and radio enthusiasts because these methods can be adopted by the vast number of people who care about the satellite's operation. Astronomy enthusiasts have a large number of specialized astronomical telescopes with perfect optics and a large viewing angle. The observation stations also have a complete set of equipment that can determine the satellite's position in the sky at a certain time.

Currently, an instrument is used by optical instrument observation stations to observe the satellite's situation in the sky. Measurements with this instrument are accurate to within one degree, and the time error of observing this situation does not exceed one second. Optical instrument observation stations observe artificial satellites in the morning or evening when the Earth's surface is dark, and the satellite itself at high altitude is illuminated by the sun.

It should be pointed out that observing satellites with astronomical instruments has certain difficulties and is different from observing ordinary astronomical targets because the satellite operates quickly in the sky, with an average speed of approximately one degree per second.

To ensure the reliability of the observation, each optical instrument observation station is equipped with one or two "optical screens" consisting of several tubes. These optical screens are placed on the meridian in a vertical circle direction perpendicular to the orbit of the satellite to be observed. In addition, when searching for the satellite, a method based on the so-called "local time rule" is used. This method uses the fact that the artificial satellite's orbit does not participate in the Earth's rotation, and the satellite itself will pass through the predetermined latitude within local sidereal time. The sidereal time changes slowly with the rotation of the orbit, and the orbit rotates around the Earth's axis in absolute space due to the gravitational field leaving the gravitational center. Therefore, at an observation station, the satellite will sequentially pass through many points in the sky during its operation, which can be called waiting points. If the axis of the optical instrument is adjusted so that it is aligned in advance with the sequential waiting points in the sky, the artificial satellite will inevitably be found sooner or later.

A large number of radio enthusiasts are observing satellites using specially designed radios. The diagrams of these radios and the diagrams of radio direction-finding devices were published long before the launch of artificial satellites in the popular radio technology science magazine "Radio." The information about the artificial satellite's operation provided by radio enthusiasts can be used not only to study the laws of radio waves passing through the atmosphere but also to roughly determine the elements of the satellite's orbit when radio enthusiasts use direction-finding devices.

To date, radio enthusiasts have provided a large amount of observation material on artificial satellites. In many places, the passage of satellites was discovered by astronomy enthusiasts. In other places, regrettably, optical observations have not been possible to date due to cloud cover.

All materials from scientific stations, as well as radio and optical observation enthusiasts, are currently being concentrated and processed. After these materials are processed, the orbital elements and their long-term maintenance in the future will be determined. The latest calculation tools, such as electronic computers, are used when processing the materials. After processing, the orbital parameters will be corrected, and the satellite's operation will be predicted. In addition, materials from observation stations can also be used to conduct many geophysical studies using satellites, such as determining the atmospheric density of the evolution of satellite orbital parameters.

Satellite Characteristics

As mentioned earlier, the satellite is spherical. Its diameter is 58 centimeters, and it weighs 83.6 kilograms. The satellite's sealed outer shell is made of aluminum alloy. The satellite's surface is smooth and has been specially processed. The satellite's entire machinery and equipment and the energy source for the machinery are installed inside the body. Before launch, the artificial satellite's body is filled with nitrogen.

Outside the satellite's body are four rod-shaped antennas, each 2.4 to 2.9 meters long. When the satellite is launched, the antenna rods are retracted on the rocket body. After the satellite is launched, the antenna rods twist their joints and appear as depicted in the picture.

When the artificial satellite is running in orbit, it is periodically subjected to intense and erratic thermal effects—scorching sunlight on the sunlit side of the Earth, cooling when flying on the dark side of the Earth, and thermal effects from the atmosphere. In addition, the satellite's internal instruments and equipment also emit a certain amount of heat during operation. In terms of temperature, the artificial satellite is an independent celestial body in a state of radiative heat exchange with the surrounding space. Therefore, ensuring the normal temperature state required for the satellite's machinery and equipment to operate for a long time is a fundamentally new and quite complex task. The necessary temperature state of the first satellite can be guaranteed because the satellite's surface has corresponding radiation and absorption coefficients of solar radiation energy, and because the thermal resistance between the satellite's outer shell and the equipment installed inside the satellite, which is caused by the forced circulation of nitrogen in the satellite body, has been adjusted.

The satellite is equipped with two radio transmitters that continuously emit signals at frequencies of 20.005 and 40.002 megacycles (wavelengths of 15 meters and 7.5 meters, respectively). It should be pointed out that due to its large weight, it is possible to install high-power radio transmitters on the artificial satellite manufactured in the Soviet Union. This makes it possible to hear the satellite's signals from a long distance, allowing a wide range of radio enthusiasts around the world to observe the satellite. Observations in the first few days of the satellite's operation confirmed that ordinary radios could reliably hear the satellite's signals at distances of several thousand kilometers. In individual cases, the satellite's signals could be heard at distances of 10,000 kilometers.

Satellite Radio Signals

Radio transmitters emit signals in the form of telegraph signals at any frequency. The signal of one frequency is transmitted during the pause of another frequency signal. The average duration of signals at each frequency is approximately 0.3 seconds. These signals are used to observe the satellite's orbit and solve some scientific problems. To record various processes occurring on the satellite, some sensitive mechanisms are installed on the satellite. When certain parameters (such as temperature) of the satellite change, these mechanisms can change the frequency of the signal and the contrast between the duration of the signal and the pause. When listening to the signals emitted by the satellite, these signals are recorded to be translated and analyzed.

It should be taken into account that after a certain period, the radio transmitter will stop transmitting signals. For example, if a meteor fragment breaks through the satellite's outer shell or damages the antenna, the radio transmitter will stop working. In addition, the satellite has a limited amount of electrical energy. After the transmitter stops working, the satellite will be observed using optical methods and radar.

Observing the distribution of radio waves emitted by the satellite is of great significance. To date, the main method of obtaining information on the ionosphere is to study radio waves emitted from the Earth and reflected back from the ionized region located below the region of maximum ionization in the ionosphere. It is currently unknown what the height of the upper boundary of the ionosphere is.

Due to the launch of the artificial satellite, it is possible to receive radio signals of two different frequencies for a long period from above the part of the ionosphere where ionization is greatest, where long-term observations could not be carried out before, and perhaps from above the entire ionosphere.

By measuring the received signal level and the angle of refraction of radio waves of various frequencies, it is possible to obtain information on the attenuation of radio waves in previously unstudied parts of the ionosphere and some information on the structure of these parts.

The scientific measurement program of artificial Earth satellites is very extensive, including many departments of upper atmospheric physics and the study of the cosmic space near the Earth.

These issues include: studying the ionosphere's situation, its chemical composition, measuring pressure and density, measuring magnetism, studying the nature of solar particle radiation, the original composition and changes of cosmic rays, the ultraviolet and X spectral segments of the sun, as well as the electrostatic potential field and particles in the upper atmosphere. The first artificial satellite has already provided information on many of these issues.

In studying cosmic rays, the plan stipulates that materials on the relative abundance of various nuclei in basic cosmic radiation must be obtained. In particular, it is necessary to determine the relative abundance of lithium, beryllium, and boron nuclei, as well as the relative abundance of nuclei with large charges. In this regard, it may be possible to obtain materials that cannot be obtained using past research methods.

The instruments installed on the satellite can also study changes in the entire cosmic ray spectrum. It is difficult to study cosmic rays with instruments installed on the Earth because there is a thick layer of atmosphere on the Earth's surface. The materials obtained can clarify diurnal, semi-diurnal, and 27-day variations and can study the relationship between these variations and phenomena on the sun. The satellite can carry out the above-mentioned measurements over the entire Earth.

Since the atmosphere absorbs the sun's shortwave radiation, this radiation has not been studied to date. Since the satellite orbits the Earth at an extremely high altitude, it is possible to install instruments designed by our physicists on it to study the ultraviolet and X-ray parts of the solar spectrum, which can determine changes in radiation intensity. This is important because, according to modern views, the sun's shortwave radiation causes ionization in the upper layers of the atmosphere. Therefore, these results will allow people to further understand the formation process of the ionosphere. The sun's shortwave radiation is caused by the sun's corona, so new results on the structure of the solar corona can be obtained from the materials on shortwave radiation.

In addition to the sun's shortwave radiation, the sun's particle radiation plays a huge role in changes in the upper atmosphere. Therefore, it is important to solve problems such as the nature of particle radiation, the intensity of radiation, the energy spectrum of particles produced by the sun, and to find out the role of solar particle radiation in the formation of auroras. These problems can be solved with newly manufactured instruments installed on artificial satellites.

The satellite flies over the Earth's ionosphere, allowing us to check a series of conclusions about the existence of circulations in the upper atmosphere made according to this or that hypothesis. Artificial satellites also allow us to study rapid changes in the Earth's magnetic field.

It is of great significance to study electrostatic fields at high altitudes (1,000 kilometers) and to solve the problem of whether the Earth and the atmosphere are charged systems. While studying the ionosphere through indirect methods of observing radio wave transmission, the satellite research plan stipulates direct measurement of the concentration of ions at various altitudes, and in the future, the chemical composition of the mass ionosphere will be studied using spectroscopic methods. If the modern concept that there are no negative ions at high altitudes is correct, then this experiment will provide complete information on the composition of the ionosphere.

There is no intention to talk about all the scientific observations currently and will be carried out by satellites during the International Geophysical Year, but we must also mention the issue of studying meteoroids in the upper atmosphere. The plan is to obtain mass spectra and the speeds of particles falling from cosmic space into the atmosphere.

Artificial satellites are the first step in conquering outer space. To achieve the ideal of manned space flight, it is necessary to study the impact of space flight conditions on biological organisms. This research should first be conducted on animals. Like the high-altitude rockets that have been launched, the Soviet Union will launch satellites with animals as passengers and will conduct detailed investigations into their movements and physiological changes.

It can be said with certainty that the implementation of the planned scientific research program using artificial Earth satellites will revolutionize many issues in physics, geophysics, and astrophysics.

With the successful launch of artificial Earth satellites, a brand new qualitative leap has been completed in science and technology, while enabling us to use direct methods to conduct scientific measurements of the cosmic space that was previously inaccessible, and opening up broad avenues for future interstellar travel.

    苏联人造地球卫星
    苏联“真理报”编辑部
    1957年10月4日，世界上发生了一件大事——苏联发射第一颗人造地球卫星获得了成功。发射卫星的消息传遍了世界每一个角落。各大洲有很多人观察到了卫星飞过。人造卫星的制成，是大批苏联科学家、工程师和工业人员长期刻苦研究和设计的结果。
    早在二十世纪初，杰出的俄国科学家齐奥尔科夫斯基就已经从理论上解决了把宇宙飞船发射到地球大气层之外的问题，他证明星际飞行的工具应当是火箭。齐奥尔科夫斯基的著作中研究了星际飞行的一系列重要问题；并且指出，建造人造地球卫星是第一个必要阶段。
    建造人造地球卫星要求解决一系列极为复杂的完全新的科学技术问题。最大的困难是设计把人造卫星发射到轨道上去的火箭。为了发射人造卫星，创造了结构上极度完善的火箭，创造了在极高的温度条件下运转的、马力强大的发动机，研究出了火箭运动的最佳条件，保证能够最有效地利用火箭。火箭要把卫星发射到轨道上就必须具有规定的运动规律，为了保证这种规定的运动规律，设计出了一种十分精密和有效的火箭自动控制系统。
    这些问题和很多其他极困难的问题之所以能够解决，是由于运用了各方面科学技术的最新成就，首先是由于苏联火箭制造业的高度技术水平。我国科学技术潜力的高度水平，科学研究机关、设计局和工业企业的精确有组织的工作，保证了能够在这样短的期间内制成了人造地球卫星。
    人造卫星发射之前还进行了大量实验工作，来创造和调整个别设备和整个体系。人造卫星的发射成功，完全证实了制造运载火箭和人造卫星时的计算和采用的基本技术是完全正确的。
    第一颗卫星的发射是广泛的科学研究计划的开始。在国际地球物理年内，这个计划将利用接连发射的许多人造卫星来继续执行，这些人造卫星的重量和体积都还要进一步增加。制造人造卫星是征服星际空间和实现宇宙飞行的第一步。
    人造卫星呈球形。它被安置在运载火箭的前端，用圆椎形的保护体封住。运送人造卫星的火箭垂直地发射出去。在发射以后不多的时间内，依靠设计的结构，火箭的轴开始逐渐离开垂直线。在进入轨道去的那一段路程的最后时刻，火箭位于几百公里的高处，以每秒约八千公尺的速度与地球表面平行地运动。在火箭发动机工作结束以后，圆椎形的保护体脱掉，人造卫星就离开火箭，开始单独运行。
    目前，围绕地球运转的是一个装载仪器的人造卫星、还有火箭和圆椎形的保护体。因为保护体脱离人造卫星和人造卫星脱离火箭的速度不大，火箭和保护体在一段时间内同人造卫星离得不远，它们沿着同人造卫星的轨道相接近的轨道围绕地球运行。随后，由于脱离时候的相对速度和大气的阻力程度的大小而造成的运行周期的不同，三个物体分散了，而在继续运行的过程中，在同一时期内，它们将会在地球表面的完全不同的点上出现。
    卫星的轨道
    卫星的轨道接近椭圆形，椭圆的焦点之一是地心。卫星飞行时距地面的高度不是固定的，而是周期性地在改变着，最高的时候可达将近一千公里。目前，轨道的近地点（它的最低点）在北半球，而远地点（轨道最高点）则在南半球。
    轨道的平面方向对恒星来说几乎是固定的。因为地球自转，因此卫星每转一圈就应当出现在其他地区的上空，每转一圈移动的位置大约相隔经度二十四度。实际移动的经度将稍微大些，因为由于引力场的偏离中央，轨道的平面将绕着地轴，朝着与地球自转相反的方向慢慢地旋转。轨道平面的这种移动距离不大，每转一次相隔大约四经度。由于地球和轨道平面的相对运动。卫星每转一周，在莫斯科的纬度上就要比十一次偏西一千五百公里左右。在赤道一带位移较大，将为二千五百公里左右。
    轨道平面和地球赤道平面之间的倾斜角度是六十五度。因此，人造卫星的轨道约在地球南极圈和北极圈之间的各地区上空经过。由于地球环绕地轴自转，轨道和赤道之间的倾斜角是和轨道平面的倾斜角不相同的。飞到北半球时，轨道向东北方向成七十一点五度角穿过赤道。然后轨道逐渐转向东方，与北纬六十五度的纬线相切时偏向南方，随后向东南方向成五十九度角穿过赤道。在南半球，轨道与南纬六十五度的纬线相切，然后偏向北方再次经过北半球。
    随着时间的消逝，由于人造卫星在地球大气上层受到的阻力，卫星轨道的形状和大小将逐渐发生变化。因为在卫星运行的高空，大气的密度极小，轨道的演变最初将是很慢的。远地点的高度将比近地点的高度减少得更加迅速，因此轨道将越来越接近圆形。当人造卫星进入密度较大的大气层时，它受到的阻力就变得极为强大。人造卫星燃烧和烧毁的情形将类似流星从宇宙坠入地球大气层烧毁的情形。
    目前，我们对大气上层的密度了解得不够精确。因此，暂时还无法准确地预测人造卫星在轨道上存在的时间。根据目前已有的大气上层密度资料和对轨道进行测量的结果，可以肯定人造卫星将环绕地球运行很长一个时期。
    现在人造卫星旋转周期为九十六分钟。随着轨道的降低，周期将因而缩短。周期变化的速度将成为轨道形状变化速度的标志。因此准确地测量人造卫星旋转周期是一项极其重要的任务。
    苏联人造卫星的轨道参数使得在各大洲很大的纬度范围内都能观察到这颗卫星。这为解决各种科学问题开辟了广泛的可能性。可以指出，把卫星发射到这个轨道上比把卫星发射到接近赤道平面的轨道上更要困难。沿赤道发射卫星时有可能在很大程度上利用地球环绕轴心旋转的速度来加快运载火箭飞行的速度。
    对卫星运行的观察
    借助人造地球卫星所进行的研究的十分重要的组成部分，是观察卫星的运行，研究观察结果并且根据研究结果推测卫星继续运行的情况。观察卫星可以通过无线电设备，也可以在天文台中通过光学仪器进行。除了专家们用他们的设备进行观察以外，还广泛地吸收无线电爱好者和一些天文学爱好者在天文台上通过专用的光学仪器进行观察。目前苏联有六十六个光学观察站和二十六个支援陆海空军志愿协会俱乐部用大量无线电观察设备定期地观察卫星。此外还有成千上万的无线电爱好者个人单独观察卫星。
    科学站是用雷达和无线电测向仪进行观察的。同时也用光学方法进行观察，并且把卫星运行的情况拍摄下来。
    我们来谈一下天文学爱好者和无线电爱好者的观察方法，因为这些方法是广大的关心卫星运行的人们都可以采用的。天文学爱好者手中有着大量专门的天文学望远镜，这种望远镜光学上很完善，视角也很大。观察站还有整套的设备，能够在一定时间测定卫星在天空中的位置。
    现在有一种仪器，光学仪器观察站就是用这种仪器来观察天空中的卫星情况的，用这种仪器来测量，其精确度可到一度，而观察这个情况的时间误差不超过一秒。光学仪器观察站在早晨或晚上观察人造卫星，在这个时候，地球表面已呈昏暗，而在高空的卫星本身却受到太阳的照射。
    应当指出，用天文仪器来观察卫星是有一定困难的，而且和观察通常的天文目标不同，因为这个卫星在天空中运行很快，其平均速度约为每秒一度。
    为了保证观察的可靠性，每个光学仪器观察站都配置有一个或二个由一些管子组成的“光学屏”，这种光学屏是按照同所要观测的卫星轨道相垂直的垂直圈方向而放置在子午线上的。此外，在寻找卫星时采用了以所谓“本地时间规则”为基础的方法。这个方法利用这样一种情况，即人造卫星的轨道并不参加地球的自转，而卫星本身将在本地星时内通过预定的纬度，星时随着轨道的旋转而慢慢变化，轨道由于引力场离开引力中心而在绝对空间围绕地球轴心旋转。因此，在一个观察站上卫星在运行过程中将顺序地通过天空中的许多点，这些点可以叫做等待点。如果把光学仪器的轴加以调整，使它事先对准天空中顺序的等待点，那么迟早必定会发现人造卫星。
    大批无线电爱好者用专门设计的收音机对卫星进行着观察。这类收音机的图样和收音机测定方位的装置的图样早在发射人造卫星以前很久就在通俗的无线电技术科学杂志“无线电”上发表了。无线电爱好者所提供的有关人造卫星运行的情况，不仅可以用于研究无线电波通过大气层的规律，而且当无线电爱好者使用测定方位的装置时，还可以利用他们所提供的情报粗略地测定卫星轨道要素。
    截至目前为止。无线电爱好者已经提供了大量的对人造卫星的观察材料。在许多地方，卫星的通过就是天文学爱好者发现的。在其他一些地方，很遗憾，由于云量的关系直到目前还不能进行光学观察。
    科学站以及无线电和光学观察爱好者的全部材料目前正在集中和加工整理。把这些材料整理完毕后，将测定出轨道要素及其今后长久的维护。在整理材料时，使用最新的计算工具，如电子计算机。整理之后，将校正轨道参数和预告卫星的运行。此外，来自观察站的材料还可以用来利用卫星进行许多地球物理学研究，如测定卫星轨道参数演变的大气密度等等。
    卫星的特性
    如前所述，卫星呈球形。它的直径为五十八公分，重八十三点六公斤。卫星的密封外壳是用铝合金制成的。卫星的表面光滑，并且经过特别加工。体内装置有卫星的全部器械需要以及器械的能源。在发射之前，人造卫星体内装满了氮气。
    在卫星体的外面装置了长二点四到二点九公尺的四根杆状天线。在发射卫星时，天线杆紧缩在火箭体上。在卫星射出去后，天线杆扭转自己的接头，而呈照片上所描绘的样子。
    人造卫星沿轨道运行时，周期性地受到激烈无常的热影响——在地球向阳的一面时是阳光的灼热，在地球背光的一面飞行时的冷却以及大气的热影响等等。此外，卫星内仪器设备在工作时也发散出一定的热量。在热度方面，人造卫星是处于与周围空间进行辐射热交换状态的一个独立天体。因此，在长时间内保证卫星上有卫星机器设备进行工作所必须的正常温度状态是一件原则性上新的相当复杂的任务。第一颗卫星必要温度状态之所以能够保证，是因为卫星表面具有相应的辐射和吸收太阳辐射能的系数值，并且因为由卫星体内氮气的强制循环产生的卫星外壳和卫星内装的设备之间的热的阻力得到了调整。
    卫星上装有两个无线电发射机不断发出讯号，频率是二○·○○五和四○·○○二兆周（波长分别为十五公尺和七点五公尺）。应当指出，在苏联制造的人造卫星上由于它的重量较大而能够装置功率大的无线电发射机。这就使得能够在很远的距离收听到卫星的讯号，使全世界各个地方的广大无线电爱好者能够观察到卫星。卫星运行的头几天的观察情况，证实了在几千公里的距离内普通的无线电收音机就能够有把握地收听到卫星的讯号。在个别情况下，在一万公里的距离内可以收听到卫星的讯号。
    卫星的无线电讯号
    无线电发射机使用任何频率都是以电报信号的形式发射讯号。一种频率的讯号在另一种频率讯号的休止时发射。每种频率的讯号平均持续时间约为零点三秒。这些讯号用来观察卫星的轨道和解决一些科学课题。为记录卫星上发生的各种过程，卫星上装置了一些敏感机件，在卫星的某些参数（温度等）有所变化时，这种机件能改变讯号的频率和讯号与休止之间持续时间的对比。收听卫星发射出的讯号时，对这些讯号进行记录，以便译出加以分析。
    应当考虑到，在一定时间之后，无线电发射机就要停止发射讯号了。例如，流星碎块击破了卫星的外壳或损坏了天线都会使无线电发射机停止工作。此外，卫星携带的电能有限，发射机停止工作以后，将用光学方法和雷达来观察卫星。
    观察卫星发射的无线电波分布情况有巨大的意义。截至目前为止，获得电离层的主要材料的方法是：研究由地球发射出去的、从位于电离层最大电离作用区之下的电离区域反射回来的无线电波。现在，实际上还不知道电离层的上界的高度是多少。
    由于人造卫星的发射，就有可能从以前无法进行长期观察的、在电离层中电离程度最大的部分以上的、也许整个电离层以上的部分，长期收到两种不同频率的无线电信号。
    测量所收到的信号级和各种频率的无线电波的折射角，就可以得到以前没有研究过的电离层部分的无线电波衰减的资料和关于这些部分的结构的若干资料。
    人造地球卫星的科学测量计划是十分广泛的，包括大气上层物理学的很多部门和研究地球附近的宇宙空间。
    这些问题包括：研究电离层的情况，它的化学组成，测量压力和密度，测量磁性，研究太阳粒子辐射的性质，宇宙射线的原始组成和变化，太阳的紫外和X光谱段，以及大气上层的静电位场和微粒。第一颗人造卫星已经可能对其中很多问题提供资料。
    在研究宇宙线方面，计划规定要获得关于各种核在基本宇宙辐射中的相对数量的材料。特别是要确定锂、錧和硼核的相对数量，以及电荷很大的核的相对数量。在这方面，可能得到用过去的研究方法得不到的材料。
    卫星上装置的仪器还可以研究整个宇宙线的变化。装置在地球上的仪器研究宇宙线是有困难的，因为地球表面上有很厚一层大气层。得到的材料可以搞清楚一昼夜、半昼夜和二十七昼夜的变化；并可以研究这种变化同太阳上的现象的关系。卫星能在整个地球上进行上述测定。
    由于大气层吸收太阳的短波辐射，这种辐射到现在还没有被研究过。卫星既然以极大的高度绕地球运行，那就可以在上面装上我们的物理学家设计的仪器来研究太阳光谱紫外线和X线部，能够查明辐射强度的变化。这一点很重要，因为根据现代的见解，太阳的短波辐射引起大气层的上层的游离。因此，这些结果将使人进一步了解电离层的形成过程。太阳的短波辐射是由于太阳的光环引起的，因此据短波辐射的材料可以获得有关太阳光环结构的新结果。
    除太阳的短波辐射外，太阳的微粒辐射对大气层上层的种种变化起着巨大的作用。因此，解决微粒辐射的本质、辐射的强度、太阳产生的粒子的能谱等问题和查明太阳微粒辐射在形成极光中的作用，是很重要的。用新制造的仪器装在人造卫星上就能解决这些问题。
    卫星在大气电离层上飞行，使我们能够检查根据这种或那种假设所作出的关于大气上层存在的环流的一系列结论。人造卫星还使我们能够研究地球磁场的迅速变化情况。
    在高空（一千公里）研究静电场和解决地球和大气层是否带电系统的问题有很大意义。与通过观察无线电波传输的间接方法研究电离层的同时，卫星研究计划规定直接测量各种高度的离子集中度，而将来还要用光谱方法研究质体电离层的化学成份。如果关于高空没有负离子这一现代概念是正确的话，那么这种试验将提供关于电离层成份的完备资料。
    这里不准备谈国际地球物理年期间现在和将来用卫星进行的全部科学观察，但我们还要提一下研究大气上层流星体的问题。计划要获得质体光谱和从宇宙空间落到大气中的微粒子的速度。
    人造卫星是征服宇宙空间的第一步。为了达到实现载人作宇宙飞行的理想，必须研究宇宙飞行条件对生物机体的影响。首先应该用动物来进行这种研究。同发射过的高空火箭一样，苏联将发射有动物作为旅客的卫星，并且将对它们的动作和生理变化过程进行详细的考察。
    可以肯定地说，用人造地球卫星来实现预定的科学研究计划将在物理学、地球物理学和天体物理学许多问题方面起革命的作用。
    随着人造地球卫星的发射成功，在科学和技术上已经完成了一次崭新的质的突变，同时使我们对直到现在还不可达到的宇宙空间能够运用直接方法进行科学测量，而且为将来的星际旅行开辟了广阔的道路。　（新华社）
