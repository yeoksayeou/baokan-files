Xinhua News Agency, New York, October 1st: The United Nations Disarmament Commission held a meeting on September 30 to discuss the report of the Disarmament Subcommittee on the results of the London negotiations.

    Soviet representative Sobolev said at the meeting that the Soviet Union had made every effort in the subcommittee to make a start on disarmament measures, but the representatives of the United States, Britain, France, and Canada adopted "methods of obstruction and piling up all kinds of obstacles," thus bringing the disarmament negotiations to a stalemate.

    The Soviet representative said that the Soviet Union hoped to fundamentally solve the problem, demanding a decisive reduction in armaments and a complete ban on nuclear weapons. However, the four Western countries were unwilling to do so.

    He said that the Soviet Union was willing to accept partial measures before a comprehensive disarmament agreement was reached. It advocated substantial reductions in armed forces and the conclusion of an agreement including all three stages of disarmament, and opposed making any conditions outside the agreement as conditions for moving from one stage to another. However, Western countries are now making the resolution of certain fundamental political issues a condition for the next stage of disarmament. Therefore, the Western disarmament plan is nothing but a farce.

    Sobolev said that the Soviet Union also advocated reducing military spending, but Western countries opposed genuinely reducing military spending, and only wanted to inquire about information on military budgets.

    He said that the Soviet Union advocated a complete ban on nuclear weapons, a cessation of the production of nuclear weapons, and the destruction of existing nuclear weapons. Because the United States and others refused, the Soviet Union later suggested that the relevant governments not use nuclear weapons. However, the US and Britain demanded "legalizing atomic and hydrogen weapons under the pretext of self-defense."

    Sobolev said that the Soviet Union suggested that troops equipped with nuclear weapons should not be stationed abroad, and that nuclear weapons should not be stockpiled in other countries. However, Western countries rejected this proposal, and the United States has or is preparing to station atomic forces in West Germany and other places in Europe and Asia.

    Sobolev said that the Soviet Union considered the Western "aerial photography" plan, but the West demanded that the Soviet Union open up its entire sky, while not allowing the Soviet Union to inspect Western bases in North Africa and the Middle East, etc. This would only provide Western countries with opportunities to collect intelligence.

    He also said that on the issue of eliminating foreign military bases, Western countries simply refused to consider it at all. The West also refused to consider the Soviet Union's proposal to reduce the German army by one-third or another proportion, and that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries and the Warsaw Treaty countries should also make corresponding reductions.

    Sobolev also called on all countries to stop war propaganda.

    The representatives of the United States, Britain, France, and Canada also spoke at the meeting. They continued to tout the Western countries' "disarmament proposals" and attempted to shift the responsibility for the failure of the London talks to the Soviet Union.

    The committee finally decided to submit the subcommittee's report and all documents to the United Nations General Assembly and the Security Council for consideration.

    联合国裁军委员会讨论伦敦会议报告
    苏联代表斥美英制造裁军僵局
    新华社1日讯  纽约消息：联合国裁军委员会9月30日举行会议，讨论裁军小组委员会关于伦敦谈判结果的报告。
    苏联代表索波列夫在会上说，苏联在小组委员会作了一切努力，以求在裁军措施上作出一个开端，但是美、英、法、加拿大四国代表采取了“阻挠和堆砌所有各式障碍的方法”，因此把裁军谈判带到了一个僵局。
    苏联代表说，苏联希望从基本上解决问题，它要求对军备作出一种决定性的裁减以及完全禁止核武器，然而四个西方国家不愿这样做。
    他说，苏联愿意在全面的裁军协议未达成以前先接受局部的措施。它主张着实地裁减武装部队，主张达成一个包括所有三个裁军阶段的协议，而反对把协定规定以外的任何条件作为从一个阶段进入另一个阶段的条件。但是西方国家现在却把解决某些基本政治问题作为下一步的裁军的条件，因此，西方的裁军方案不过是一幕假戏而已。
    索波列夫说，苏联还主张削减军费，但是西方国家反对真正削减军费，它们仅仅想由此打听军事预算的情报。
    他说，苏联主张完全禁止核武器、停止生产核武器和销毁已有的核武器，由于美国等表示拒绝，后来苏联又建议有关政府不使用核武器。然而美英要求“在自卫的借口下把原子武器和氢武器合法化”。
    索波列夫说，苏联建议装配核武器的军队不应当驻到国外去，同时不应当在别的国家聚积核武器，但是西方国家拒绝这个建议，美国已经或者正在准备把原子部队驻扎在西德和欧洲和亚洲的其他地方。
    索波列夫说，苏联考虑了西方的“空中摄影”计划，但是西方却要求苏联开放全部天空，而不许苏联视察西方在北非和中东等处的基地，这样就只能为西方国家提供机会收集情报。
    他还说，在取消国外军事基地这个问题上，西方国家干脆就完全不愿考虑。西方还拒绝考虑苏联这样的一个建议：削减德国的军队三分之一或其他比例，北大西洋公约国家和华沙条约国家也作相应的削减。
    索波列夫还要求各国停止战争宣传。
    美、英、法、加拿大的代表也在会上发了言，他们仍然吹嘘西方国家的“裁军建议”，并且企图把伦敦会谈失败的责任推到苏联身上去。
    委员会最后决定把小组委员会的报告和一切文件交给联合国大会和安全理事会考虑。
