    The Development of Science and Technology Cannot Be Separated from Politics
    —Starting with the Anti-Rightist Struggle in the Health Sector
    Currently, the anti-Rightist struggle in the health sector is developing in depth, and more and more medical and health workers have raised their awareness and actively joined this great debate about the major issues of right and wrong concerning the country and the nation.
    Rightist elements hidden in the health sector were also rampant for a time during the initial stage of the great airing of views and the rectification movement. They cooperated with Rightist elements from all walks of life, especially from the political and intellectual circles, appearing as if they were concerned about the development of medical and health work, and they wantonly distorted and slandered the Communist Party's basic policies and guidelines in medical and health work, and negated the achievements of medical and health work since liberation. Their spearhead was first and foremost directed at the leadership of the Communist Party, saying that the Communist Party did not understand science and technology and could not lead medical and health work; that under the leadership of the Communist Party in the past few years, medical and health work had not progressed, but had regressed; and so on. They attempted to use this despicable method of distorting the facts to provoke dissatisfaction among medical and health workers and incite them to overthrow the leadership of the Communist Party and change the socialist direction of our country's medical and health work.
    It should be said that for medical and health workers who have a firm position and a clear understanding, the Rightist elements' tactics are easy to see through, and they have indeed seen through them. However, some medical and health workers, especially some experts, have not seen the true face of the Rightists.
    Why does this phenomenon occur? The main reason is that they have not yet resolved the relationship between politics and science and technology. They not only believe that politics and science and technology are unrelated, but also believe that politics is something that scholars and experts should not be concerned with, and are "too disdainful" to be concerned with. They do not approve of any political movements, especially political movements in scientific and technological departments. Because in their view, political movements not only cannot solve the problems of scientific and technological departments, but also hinder the progress of scientific and technological work. In short, they have not realized the relationship between the anti-Rightist struggle and the future of the country and the nation, nor have they realized the relationship between this struggle and their own professions.
    This situation exists in the health sector, and more or less exists in other scientific and technological fields as well.
    The debate between us and the Rightists is first and foremost focused on whether or not we should have the dictatorship of the proletariat and the leadership of the Communist Party. Can we say that this issue is only related to ordinary people and not to scientific and technological workers? Of course not. Because this is a fundamental issue concerning the rise and fall of the country and the nation. If we want the dictatorship of the proletariat and the leadership of the Communist Party, then the socialist country will prosper; if we do not want the dictatorship of the proletariat and the leadership of the Communist Party, then the socialist country will perish. If the socialist country perishes, what will follow is inevitably the re-domination of China by imperialism, which will inevitably plunge the people back into the abyss of suffering. The scene of China being ruled by imperialism in the past is still vivid in our minds, and is something that many scientific and technological workers have personally seen and experienced. To make China an independent, free, and prosperous country is something that any patriotic intellectual dreamed of in the past; now this great ideal has become a reality, and our country has emerged in the world as a socialist power, and the people are living a peaceful and happy life of construction. However, at this time, the bourgeois Rightists have come out to oppose the leadership of the Communist Party, that is, to oppose the dictatorship of the proletariat, and attempt to create a situation in our country that would allow capitalism and imperialism to make a comeback. Is this something that patriotic scientific and technological workers can tolerate? Is fighting against Rightist elements with such sinister schemes unrelated to scientific and technological workers?
    Looking at the issue of who science and technology serves, it also shows that the anti-Rightist struggle is not unrelated to scientific and technological workers. Everyone knows that science and technology itself has no class character, but in a class society, those who master science and technology cannot be without class character. Therefore, who science and technology is used to serve cannot be without class character. If science and technology is mastered by the reactionary ruling class, it will mainly be used to serve the interests of the reactionary ruling class, and will not fully, freely, and unconditionally serve the broad masses of the people, and may even be used for the evil purposes of opposing the people. The use of the achievements of medicine and biology to manufacture bacteriological weapons by imperialists is a very obvious example. The state of medical and health science in China during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang is also an example. How much did the Kuomintang regime use medical and health science to serve the people? This is something that medical and health workers who worked in that era know. From this, it is not difficult to imagine that if the Rightists' political conspiracy really succeeded and our people's democratic regime was overthrown, then not only medical and health work, but also the entire scientific and technological work, would revert to the past tragic state.
    Some people may say that in the era of Kuomintang rule, medical and health workers also treated illnesses for the working people and served the working people, didn't they? Yes, there were such things, but we should think about whether medical and health work can be earnestly used to serve the people in the new China of the people or in the old China under reactionary rule? In the areas ruled by the Kuomintang at that time, it can almost be said that the vast rural areas were without doctors and medicines, the people had no money to treat illnesses, and there was no way to treat illnesses. Many people who were sick had no choice but to resign themselves to fate. At that time, the infant mortality rate in our country was as high as 200 per thousand, and the population mortality rate was as high as 25 per thousand. Extremely harmful diseases such as cholera, plague, smallpox, kala-azar, and schistosomiasis were prevalent among the people and could not be eradicated. The Kuomintang authorities did not care about all this, nor were they willing to care about it. On the contrary, its reactionary rule constantly created a large number of diseases and deaths. The tragic encounters of the people in the disaster areas during the Kuomintang rule best illustrate this problem. At that time, whenever a disaster occurred, what followed was inevitably the prevalence of diseases, and the Kuomintang government neither seriously provided disaster relief nor seriously treated the people. Therefore, not only did a large number of disaster victims freeze and starve to death due to lack of food and clothing, but also a large number of disaster victims died of illness due to lack of medicine and medical care. What is the situation in the new China under the leadership of the Communist Party? In recent years, we have not only basically eliminated the infectious diseases that seriously endanger the people, but are also taking many effective measures to enhance the people's physical fitness and resistance to diseases. As for after a disaster occurs, the people's government immediately dispatches grain and various materials to provide support, and immediately sends medical teams to the disaster areas to treat the people, thereby greatly reducing the mortality rate of diseases. Taking the research of medical and health science as an example, during the Kuomintang rule, there was only one Central Health Experimental Institute, the number of people engaged in research work was small, and there were very few medical and health publications. After the liberation of the whole country, we have successively established research institutions such as the Institute of Parasitic Diseases, the Institute of Epidemiology, the Institute of Occupational Health, the Institute of Tuberculosis, the Institute of Skin and Venereal Diseases, the Hainan Island Malaria Research Institute, the Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine, and the Southwest Chinese Herbal Medicine Research Institute. Including the researchers in various medical colleges, there are now more than 3,000 researchers, and the circulation of large medical and health magazines has increased sixty times compared with before liberation. May I ask: Without the socialist system and without the leadership of the Communist Party, could the research of medical and health science in our country have such a rapid development speed?
    For scientific and technological workers, the relationship between science and technology and politics is an old problem. Many people have solved this problem, but there are still many people who have not completely solved this problem. We hope that the broad masses of scientific and technological workers can actively participate in the anti-Rightist struggle, on the one hand, resolutely draw a clear line with the Rightist elements and thoroughly expose their hypocritical faces, and on the other hand, strive to transform themselves in this struggle, gradually abandon the bourgeois stand, resolutely stand on the side of the working class, and transform themselves into socialist intellectuals of the working class who resolutely serve the people.

    科学技术的发展不能脱离政治
    ——从卫生界的反右派斗争谈起
    目前，卫生界的反右派斗争正在深入发展中，愈来愈多的医药卫生工作者提高了觉悟，积极投入了这场关于国家民族的大是大非的大辩论。
    隐藏在卫生界的右派分子，在大鸣大放和整风运动的初期，也曾经猖獗一时。他们同社会各界、特别是政治界和知识界的右派分子配合起来，以关心医药卫生工作发展的姿态出现，大肆歪曲和污蔑共产党在医药卫生工作方面的各项基本政策方针，抹杀解放以来医药卫生工作的成绩。他们的矛头首先而且主要指向共产党的领导，说共产党不懂得科学技术，不能领导医药卫生工作；过去几年在共产党的领导下，医药卫生工作不是进步了，而是退步了；等等。他们企图用这种颠倒黑白的卑鄙手法，挑起医药卫生工作者的不满，煽动他们起来推翻共产党的领导，改变我国医药卫生工作的社会主义方向。
    应当说，对于立场坚定和认识清楚的医药卫生工作者，右派分子的这种手法是容易识破的，而且他们确实识破了。但是也有一部分医药卫生工作者，特别是一部分专家，并没有看清右派的真面目。
    为什么发生这种现象呢？主要的原因是他们还没有解决政治和科学技术的关系问题。他们不仅认为政治和科学技术无关，而且认为政治是学者专家不应过问，也“不屑于”过问的。他们不赞成一切的政治运动，尤其不赞成在科学技术部门搞政治运动。因为在他们看来，政治运动不仅解决不了科学技术部门的问题，而且会妨害科学技术工作的进行。总之，他们没有认识到反右派斗争同国家民族的前途之间的关系，也没有认识到这个斗争同他们所从事的专业之间的关系。
    这种情况，存在于卫生界，也或多或少地存在于其他科学技术界。
    我们同右派之间的争论，首先而且主要集中在要不要无产阶级专政，要不要共产党的领导上。能不能说这个问题只和一般人有关系，和科学技术工作者没有关系呢？当然不能这样说。因为这是关系着国家民族兴亡的根本问题。要无产阶级专政，要共产党的领导，则社会主义国家兴；不要无产阶级专政，不要共产党的领导，则社会主义国家亡。社会主义国家亡了，继之而来的就必然是帝国主义对中国的重新统治，必然使人民重新陷于水深火热的境地。中国过去受帝国主义统治的情景还历历在目，是许多科学技术工作者亲眼见过和亲身经历过的。要中国成为一个独立、自由和富强的国家，这是过去任何一个有爱国心的知识分子梦寐以求的；现在这个伟大的理想已经成为现实，我国已经以一个社会主义强国的姿态出现于世界，人民正在过着和平幸福的建设生活。然而就在这个时候，资产阶级的右派却出来反对共产党的领导，也就是反对无产阶级专政，企图在我国造成使资本主义和帝国主义卷土重来的局势。这难道是爱国的科学技术工作者能够容忍的么？同怀着这种阴谋诡计的右派分子作斗争，这难道是和科学技术工作者无关的么？
    再从科学技术为谁服务的问题来看，也说明反右派斗争不是和科学技术工作者无关的。大家都知道，科学技术本身是没有阶级性的，但是在阶级社会中，掌握科学技术的人不可能没有阶级性。因此，科学技术用来为谁服务，就不可能没有阶级性。科学技术如果被反动的统治阶级掌握，它就会主要被用来为反动统治阶级的利益服务，就不会充分地、自由地、无条件地为广大的人民服务，甚至往往被用于反对人民的罪恶目的。帝国主义者利用医学、生物学发展的成果制造细菌战争，就是一个极明显的例子。在国民党反动统治的时代，中国医药卫生科学的状况，也是一个例子。国民党政权究竟把医药卫生科学用来为人民服务了多少，这是在那个时代工作过的医药卫生工作者都知道的。从这里也就不难想见，如果右派的政治阴谋真的实现了，我们的人民民主政权被推翻了，那就不仅是医药卫生工作，而且整个的科学技术工作，都会回复到过去的悲惨状况。
    有人可能会说，在国民党统治的时代，医药卫生工作者不也是为劳动人民看过病，为劳动人民服务过吗？是的，确有这样的事情，但是应该想一想，究竟是在人民的新中国，还是在反动统治的旧中国，医药卫生工作能够认真地用来为人民服务呢？在当时国民党统治的地区，几乎可以说广大的农村是无医无药，人民没有钱治病，也没有办法治病，许多人有了病，只好听天由命。当时我国婴儿的死亡率高达千分之二百，人口死亡率高达千分之二十五。霍乱、鼠疫、天花、黑热病、血吸虫病等危害极大的疾病，在人民中间流行而无法扑灭。这一切，国民党当局都没有过问过，也不愿意过问。相反，它的反动统治，还不断地制造了大批的疾病和死亡。在国民党统治的时期，灾区人民的悲惨遭遇，最足以说明这个问题。当时每遇灾荒发生，随之而来的必然是疾病流行，而国民党政府既不认真救灾，更不认真为人民治病。因此，不但有大批灾民因为缺衣缺食而冻饿致死，而且有大批灾民因为无医无药而病死。在共产党领导下的新中国，情况又怎样呢？这几年来，我们不但已经基本上消灭了严重危害人民的流行病，而且正在采取许多有效的措施，以增强人民的体质和抵抗疾病的能力。至于在灾荒发生以后，人民政府更是立即调运粮食和各种器材加以支援，并且立即派出医疗队前往灾区为人民治病，从而大大地减少了疾病的死亡率。再以医药卫生科学的研究来说，在国民党统治时期，只有一个中央卫生实验院，从事研究工作的人员是不多的，医药卫生刊物也是寥寥无几。而在全国解放以后，我们已相继成立了寄生虫病研究所、流行病学研究所、劳动卫生研究所、结核病研究所、皮肤性病研究所、海南岛疟疾研究所、中医研究院、西南中药研究所等研究机构，连各医学院校从事研究工作的人员在内，研究人员已达三千多人，大型的医药卫生杂志的发行数，较解放前增加了六十倍。试问：没有社会主义的制度，没有共产党的领导，我国的医药卫生科学的研究能有这样迅速的发展速度吗？
    对于科学技术工作者来说，科学技术和政治的关系问题，已经是一个老问题了。许多人已经解决了这个问题，但是也还有许多人没有彻底地解决这个问题。我们希望，广大的科学技术工作者，都能积极地投入反右派斗争，一方面，坚决同右派分子划清界限，彻底揭露他们的伪善面目，另一方面，要在这个斗争中努力改造自己，逐步抛弃资产阶级的立场，坚决地站到工人阶级方面，把自己改造成为坚决为人民服务的工人阶级的社会主义的知识分子。
