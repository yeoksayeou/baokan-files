　　Consolidating and Developing Sino-Soviet Friendship
　　Li Jishen, Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang

    We celebrate the 40th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution with infinite excitement and joy. The forty years from 1917 to 1957 have been extraordinary. Over these forty years, the socialist system has been like a bright sun in the sky, increasingly radiating dazzling light; the capitalist system, on the other hand, is nearing its end, and it is impossible to save its inevitable decline.

    Before the October Revolution, there had been various revolutions, but these revolutions only transferred power from one exploiting class to another, replacing one form of exploitation with another, while exploitation always existed. Only the October Revolution declared the end of exploitation of man by man, the end of all class oppression and national oppression, and realized the great ideals of socialism, peace, and friendly relations among all nations. Precisely because the October Revolution was the most profound and largest revolution in human history, the landlords, capitalists, and Tsarist aristocrats within the Soviet Union, and the imperialist governments abroad, all gathered together to form a new anti-Soviet, anti-communist "crusade," opposing the newly born Soviet Republic, vainly attempting to strangle the first socialist state of workers and peasants in its cradle. The workers, laboring peasants, and revolutionary intellectuals of the Soviet Union, with the sympathy and support of progressive people around the world, defeated the armed intervention of fourteen imperialist countries and quelled the domestic counter-revolutionary rebellions. The great socialist Soviet Union, under the gaze and eager anticipation of progressive people all over the world, stood tall and developed. Before World War II, the Soviet Union had completed the tasks of national industrialization and agricultural collectivization, changed the backward industrialization and widespread illiteracy of Tsarist Russia, and built an advanced socialist society. During World War II, the Soviet Union defeated the German, Italian, and Japanese fascist invaders and saved world civilization. This war was a severe test for the Soviet people and the socialist system, and the outcome of the war proved that the Soviet state was incomparably consolidated and powerful, and that the socialist system possessed endless vitality. After the war, the Soviet Union quickly healed the wounds of war and moved towards a more beautiful communist society. Currently, the Soviet Union is formulating a long-term plan for the development of the national economy in order to catch up with and surpass the most developed capitalist countries in terms of per capita output in the shortest historical period. The level of industrial production in the Soviet Union has jumped to first place in Europe and second place in the world. In the latest science and technology, it far exceeds any capitalist country. As is well known, the world's first atomic power station was built by the Soviet Union, the first intercontinental missile was successfully tested by the Soviet Union, and the first artificial earth satellite was launched by the Soviet Union. All of this is the fruitful result of the October Socialist Revolution.

    The victory of the October Revolution and the establishment of the Soviet Union fundamentally shook the rule of imperialism, gave all oppressed classes and oppressed nations infinite hope, confidence, and courage, and opened up broad paths for the liberation cause of all countries. As far as China is concerned, before the October Revolution, the Chinese people had waged a long and heroic struggle against imperialist aggression and the oppression of feudal forces, but due to the lack of a correct path and the leadership of the Communist Party, they all failed one after another. "The salvoes of the October Revolution brought us Marxism-Leninism." (Mao Zedong) China's advanced elements, through the introduction of the Russians, found the weapon of Marxism-Leninism and combined it with the Chinese workers' movement, which gave a new look to the Chinese revolution.

    The Soviet Union's help to the Chinese revolution has been consistent. It has not only given us invaluable help in revolutionary theory and experience, but also provided many major direct assistance to our people's liberation cause. During the First Revolutionary Civil War, the Soviet Union actively helped China establish a revolutionary army, organize a revolutionary front, and train revolutionary cadres. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Soviet Union aided China morally and materially, supplied a large amount of munitions, and dispatched volunteer air force to fight alongside the Chinese people. After the powerful Soviet army defeated Hitler's Germany, it immediately declared war on Japanese fascism, quickly annihilated 700,000 elite Japanese troops, liberated Northeast China, and forced the Japanese aggressors to surrender unconditionally. During the Third Revolutionary Civil War, the Soviet Union resolutely opposed the United States' interference in China's internal affairs, and the Soviet Union's stationing of troops in Lushun after World War II played a major role in the victory of the Chinese people's revolution. All this undeniably shows that without the October Revolution and without the Soviet Union's tremendous assistance to our country, the victory of the Chinese people's revolution would have been unimaginable.

    In 1949, the People's Republic of China was founded. The Soviet Union was the first to announce its recognition of our country. Then Chairman Mao personally visited the Soviet Union and concluded a treaty of friendship, alliance, and mutual assistance with the Soviet Union. The traditional friendship between China and the Soviet Union has developed on a new basis and on a larger scale. The Soviet Union's sincere and selfless economic assistance has played a major role in restoring China's national economy and promoting China's socialist industrialization. Over the past eight years, the Soviet Union has provided comprehensive, systematic, and meticulous assistance to our country through preferential loans, the supply of machinery and equipment, the dispatch of experts, and the training of Chinese technicians. From 1953, when China began to implement the first five-year plan centered on industrialization, the Soviet Union successively decided to help China build and renovate 211 important enterprises that are decisive for China's socialist industrialization, constituting the backbone of China's five-year plan for industrial construction. Today, from east to west, from south to north, in every major construction project, in every newly built and renovated enterprise, the hard work of Soviet comrades is infiltrated, and they are the crystallization and ironclad proof of Sino-Soviet friendship.

    The road of the October Revolution is the road to human liberation, and it is the road for all countries and all nations to achieve true freedom and happiness. Mr. Sun Yat-sen called on us to "take Russia as our teacher," which means that we must take the road of the October Revolution. This is the final conclusion drawn by Sun Yat-sen after engaging in the Chinese revolution for his entire life and after countless hardships, and it is also the most correct conclusion. We must resolutely follow the path of the October Revolution until the realization of communist society.

    Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people have followed the path of the October Revolution and have achieved great achievements that we could not have dreamed of in the past. China has become a strong country, the Chinese people are living a life of warmth, contentment, and happiness, many huge constructions have been successful, and industrial and agricultural production have greatly increased. This is obvious to all. But there are still a small handful of bourgeois rightists who are completely unaware and still want to oppose the Soviet Union, oppose the Communist Party, oppose the people, and oppose socialism. This is harming the common interests of the 600 million people, so the rightists must be thoroughly defeated.

    Chairman Mao taught us: "The unity of the people of China and the Soviet Union is extremely important. If the people of these two countries are united, the unity of the people of the world will not be difficult." He also said: "The unity of the people of the two great powers, China and the Soviet Union, ... will not only inevitably affect the prosperity of the two great powers, China and the Soviet Union, but will also inevitably affect the future of mankind and affect the victory of world peace and justice." Celebrating the 40th anniversary of the Great October Revolution, we must, in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions, consolidate and develop Sino-Soviet friendship ten times a hundredfold, unhesitatingly follow the path of the October Revolution, and contribute our strength to the lofty cause of world peace and human progress!

    Long live the great October Socialist Revolution!
    Long live the unbreakable Sino-Soviet friendship!

　　巩固和发展中苏友谊
　　中国国民党革命委员会主席  李济深
    我们以无限兴奋愉快的心情来庆祝伟大的十月社会主义革命的四十周年。从1917到1957，是很不平常的四十年。这四十年来，社会主义制度犹如丽日中天，日益焕发着耀眼的光芒；资本主义制度则已日薄西山，不可能挽救其必然没落的命运。
    在十月革命以前，也曾经有过这样那样的革命，但是这些革命只是使政权从一个剥削阶级手里转到另一个剥削阶级的手里，以一种剥削形式代替另一种剥削形式，而剥削是始终存在的。只有十月革命，才宣告了人对人的剥削的结束，宣告了一切阶级压迫和民族压迫的结束，实现了社会主义、和平、各民族平等友好的伟大理想。正因为十月革命是人类历史上影响最深、规模最大的一次革命，所以苏联国内的地主、资本家、沙皇贵族，国外的帝国主义政府，都纠集起来，组成反苏、反共的新“十字军”，反对新诞生的苏维埃共和国，妄想把第一个社会主义的工农国家，扼杀在摇篮中。苏联的工人、劳动农民和革命知识分子，在全世界进步人民的同情和支持下，击败了十四个帝国主义国家的武装干涉，戡平了国内的反革命叛乱。伟大的社会主义的苏联，在全世界进步人民的注视和热望中，屹立着，发展着。在第二次世界大战以前，苏联就完成了国家工业化和农业集体化的任务，改变了沙皇俄国工业落后、文盲众多的状况，建成了先进的社会主义社会。在第二次世界大战中，苏联又战胜了德、意、日法西斯侵略者，拯救了世界文明。这次大战对苏联人民和社会主义制度，是一次严峻的考验，战争的结局证明：苏维埃国家无比巩固和强大，社会主义制度具有无穷无尽的生命力。战后，苏联迅速地医治好战争的创伤，向着更加美好的共产主义社会迈进。目前，苏联正在制定发展国民经济的长期计划，以便在最短的历史时期内，在按人口计算的产量方面，赶上并超过最发达的资本主义国家。苏联的工业生产水平，已跃居欧洲第一位，世界第二位。在最新的科学技术方面，更远远地超过任何一个资本主义国家。如所周知，世界上第一个原子能发电站是苏联建成的，第一个洲际导弹是苏联试验成功的，第一个人造地球卫星是苏联发射的。所有这一切，都是十月社会主义革命所创造的丰硕成果。
    十月革命的胜利和苏联的成立，从根本上动摇了帝国主义的统治，给一切被压迫阶级和被压迫民族以无限的希望、信心和勇气，给各国人民的解放事业开辟了广大的道路。就中国而言，在十月革命以前，中国人民为了反对帝国主义的侵略和封建势力的压迫，曾经进行了长期的英勇的斗争，但是，由于缺乏正确的道路和共产党的领导，都先后失败了。“十月革命一声炮响，给我们送来了马克思列宁主义。”（毛主席语）中国的先进分子，经过俄国人的介绍，找到了马克思列宁主义的武器，并且和中国的工人运动结合起来，就使中国革命的面貌为之一新。
    苏联对中国革命的帮助是一贯的，它不仅在革命理论和经验上给了我们以无可估量的帮助，而且对我国人民的解放事业作了许多重大的直接的支援。在第一次国内革命战争期间，苏联积极地帮助中国建立革命的军队，组织革命的战线，并培养革命的干部。在抗日战争期间，苏联从道义和物质上援助中国，供应大批军火，派遣志愿空军，和中国人民并肩作战。强大的苏军在击溃了希特勒德国之后，接着就对日本法西斯宣战，迅速地歼灭了七十万日本的精锐军队，解放了我国东北，迫使日本侵略者无条件投降。在第三次国内革命战争期间，苏联坚决反对美国干涉中国内政，加上苏联在第二次世界大战后驻军旅顺，对中国人民革命的胜利，起了重大的作用。这一切，都无可争辩地说明了：如果没有十月革命，没有苏联对我国的巨大援助，中国人民革命的胜利是不可想像的。
    1949年，中华人民共和国成立了，苏联第一个宣布承认我国，接着毛主席亲自访问了苏联，和苏联订立了友好同盟互助条约。中国和苏联的传统友谊，在新的基础上，在更大的规模上发展起来了。苏联对我国真诚无私的经济援助，对于恢复我国的国民经济和促进我国的社会主义工业化，起了重大的作用。八年来，苏联通过优惠贷款、供应机器设备、派遣专家和培养我国技术人员等等方式，对我国进行了全面的、系统的、无微不至的援助。从1953年起，我国开始实行以工业化为中心的第一个五年计划，苏联又先后决定帮助我国新建和改建二百一十一项对于我国社会主义工业化具有决定意义的重要企业，构成了我国五年计划工业建设的骨干。今天，从东到西，从南到北，在每一项重大建设工程上，每一个新建和改建的企业里，都渗透着苏联同志的心血，都是中苏友谊的结晶和铁证。
    十月革命的道路是人类解放的道路，是一切国家一切民族取得真正的自由幸福的道路。孙中山先生号召我们“以俄为师”，就是叫我们要走十月革命的道路。这是孙中山一生从事于中国革命事业，经过数不尽的艰难困苦而得出的最后结论，也是最正确的结论。我们必须坚决地走十月革命的道路，直到共产主义社会的实现。
    中国人民在中国共产党领导下，循着十月革命的道路，已经取得了我们过去梦想不到的伟大成就，中国已成为强盛的国家，中国人民已过着温饱愉快的生活，许多巨大的建设已经成功，工业和农业生产已经大大增加，这是有目共见的。但居然还有一小撮资产阶级右派分子，毫无觉悟，还要反苏、反共、反人民、反社会主义，这是危害六亿人民的共同利益，所以必须彻底打垮右派。
    毛主席教导我们：“中苏两国人民的团结极为重要，这两国人民团结一致了，世界人民的团结就不困难了。”又说：“中苏两大国人民的团结，……不但必然要影响中苏两大国的繁荣，而且必然要影响到人类的将来，影响到全世界和平与正义的胜利。”庆祝伟大的十月革命四十周年，我们一定要按照毛主席的指示，十倍百倍地巩固和发展中苏友谊，毫不迟疑地走十月革命的道路，为世界和平和人类进步的崇高事业，贡献出我们的力量！
    伟大的十月社会主义革命万岁！
    牢不可破的中苏友谊万岁！
