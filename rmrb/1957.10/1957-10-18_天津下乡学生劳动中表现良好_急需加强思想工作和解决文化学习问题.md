　　Tianjin Students Doing Well in Countryside Labor; Urgent Need to Strengthen Ideological Work and Solve Cultural Learning Problems

　　(Our report) The Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Municipal People's Committee recently sent people to relevant agricultural production cooperatives in the suburbs of Tianjin and Ninghe and Jinghai Counties in Hebei Province to inspect the situation of some middle and primary school graduates in Tianjin who have participated in agricultural production this year.

　　According to the inspection, among the more than 2,300 middle and primary school graduates in Tianjin who participated in agricultural production this year, except for one person who returned to the city, the rest have stuck to their production posts. After arriving in the countryside, they showed high labor enthusiasm and a spirit of hard work and willingness to learn agricultural technology in production, and were warmly welcomed by the broad masses of peasants. In the Shuguang Agricultural Cooperative in Chitu Township, Eastern Suburb of Tianjin, 21 high school and junior high school graduates participated in production. Many of them participated in field labor the day after they arrived in the countryside, and many worked continuously for more than a month without taking a break. High school graduate Zhang Chenggui and others signed up to be feeders, feeding pigs and cleaning pigsties every day, and were very diligent. Sun Jinglong, a junior high school graduate from the Twelfth Middle School, not only worked well, but also led some veteran cooperative members to use scientific methods to cultivate cotton fields and raise fat pigs, so that the weight of the pigs increased by an average of half a catty every ten days. The peasants welcomed and trusted him. In September, everyone elected him as the deputy director of the Qianjin Agricultural Cooperative in Dawangmiao Township. These students who went to the countryside to work have now made up their minds to settle down in the countryside, and some of them are even planning to bring their relatives to the countryside.

　　In this inspection, it was found that a common problem was that some townships and cooperatives paid more attention to taking care of the students' lives, but not enough attention was paid to ideological education. Many townships and cooperatives also did not pay enough attention to students' cultural learning.

　　天津下乡学生劳动中表现良好
    急需加强思想工作和解决文化学习问题
    本报讯　中共天津市委会和市人民委员会最近派人到本市郊区和河北省宁河、静海等县的有关农业生产合作社，检查了天津今年部分中、小学毕业生参加农业生产以后的情况。
    据检查了解，今年天津市参加农业生产的两千三百多中小学毕业生中，除一人返回城市以外，其余的人都坚守生产岗位。他们到农村以后，在生产中表现了高涨的劳动热情以及吃苦耐劳、努力学习农业技术的精神，受到了广大农民的热烈欢迎。在天津东郊区赤土乡曙光农业社参加生产的二十一名高、初中毕业生，下乡的第二天就参加田间劳动，许多人连续劳动了一个多月都没有歇过工。高中毕业生张成圭等并报名当了饲养员，每天喂猪，打扫猪圈，非常勤快。十二中初中毕业生孙景龙，不仅劳动得好，还带动一些老社员用科学方法修整棉田、饲养肥猪，使猪的体重平均每十天长半斤肉。农民们欢迎和信任他，9月间，大家推选他当了大王庙乡前进农业社的副社长。这些下乡劳动的学生，现在都已下定决心在农村安家落户，有的人并且还计划把亲人接到乡下去。
    在这次检查中，发现带普遍性的问题是有些乡、社对下乡的学生，生活上照顾的比较多，而思想教育工作注意的不够。也有不少乡、社对学生的文化学习不够重视。
