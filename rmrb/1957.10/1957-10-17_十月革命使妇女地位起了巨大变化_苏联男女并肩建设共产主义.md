Moscow Dispatch from Our Newspaper, October 16th. The status of Soviet women has undergone tremendous changes in the forty years since the October Revolution. They are building socialism and communism side by side with men, and they live in a happy environment that is completely different from that of capitalist countries. Petrova, Secretary of the Soviet Women's Committee, spoke to reporters about these situations. She said:

　　Before the October Revolution, Russian women had no rights in society or in the family. They were completely subordinate to their husbands. Without her husband's permission, a wife could not change her address. A wife did not have her own passport; her name was on her husband's passport. Due to the development of industry, women also participated in production, but most of them did rough work, and there were not many working in the light industry sector. After the October Revolution, the first decrees of the Soviet regime gave Soviet women equal rights with men. Women had the right to vote and to be elected. Men and women were also equal in the family. However, as Lenin said, in order to truly equalize women with men, women must be attracted to social production. Therefore, illiteracy was eliminated among women and vocational education was carried out. The phenomenon that 86% of women were illiterate has been eliminated. Now women account for 45% of all production departments and 53% of experts. There are 480,000 female engineers and technicians in industry. Many women have become foremen, workshop directors, and factory directors. In rural areas, collectivization has truly equalized women with men. In the past, they worked for their husbands and mothers-in-law. Now, they have their own work-day pay, and they are independent. Many women have become production team leaders, collective farm chairpersons, and tractor drivers. Women account for 40% of agronomists, veterinarians, and livestock technicians with higher education. In terms of culture, education, and science, women are no less than men: women account for 75% of doctors, 70% of teachers, and 36% of scientific workers.

　　Soviet women are active figures in social and political life. Three hundred and forty-eight representatives to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union are women; one-third of the representatives to the Supreme Soviets of the Union Republics are women; and 40% of the representatives to local Soviets are women. In contrast, there are only sixteen women in the U.S. Congress and only one woman in the Senate. In the Soviet Union, many women serve as ministers, deputy ministers, and deputy chairpersons of the Council of Ministers of the All-Union and Union Republics, such as Alisa Venedikt, Deputy Chairperson of the Latvian Council of Ministers, Kvokha Ze, Deputy Chairperson of the Georgian Council of Ministers, and Kovrigina, Minister of Health of the Soviet Union. In terms of Party work, Furtseva is a member of the Presidium of the CPSU Central Committee, and Rakhim Babayeva is Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Uzbekistan.

　　In order to enable them to participate in production, the Soviet Union has created many conditions. Canteens and cold food departments are generally set up in factories, institutions, and schools; stores sell concentrated soup and semi-finished dishes; housing is gasified and electrified; newly built houses have cold and hot water; refrigerators, washing machines, vacuum cleaners are produced in large quantities... All of this greatly reduces women's housework. More importantly, kindergartens, nurseries, boarding schools, etc. have been widely established. Collective farms have seasonal nurseries, which take care of 3 million babies for farm women during the busy farming season. Students in the lower grades of Soviet elementary schools only attend school for four hours a day, while their mothers work eight hours. Therefore, a practice is now being promoted where schools continue to take care of them for four hours.

　　In capitalist countries, the issue of women's labor rights has not been fully resolved. Women stand at the forefront of the army of the unemployed. Women do the same work but do not receive equal pay. Capitalists use this unequal pay to depress the wages of male workers. France passed a law on equal pay for equal work when a Communist Party member was Minister of Labor in the past. This law has not been repealed now, but in reality, female workers' wages are 10% to 30% lower. During World War II, the United States and Britain also held kindergartens in order to use female labor. After the war, when female labor was no longer needed, the kindergartens were closed. Capitalists shouted the slogan "Women should return to the family." In capitalist countries, women do not have equal status in the family. A wife can only enter a factory with her husband's consent. Women have no inheritance rights. According to the law, children belong to the father. In the United States, women do not have the right to appear in court as plaintiffs.

　　Petrova has been to many capitalist countries and has seen the above-mentioned series of phenomena of women being oppressed. She said: Soviet women have a much broader perspective than women in capitalist countries. Once, she asked a female worker in Leningrad: "What do you work for?" The female worker found the question too strange and replied: "It's meaningless to be a person without working. I am a member of society, and this socialist society is engaged in construction. I cannot but participate in this construction." In Azerbaijan, there is a female chairperson of a collective farm, Shaman Gasanova, who has been awarded the title of Hero of Socialist Labor twice. In the past, people there did not respect women, only respected the elderly; now, men and the elderly listen to her commands. Her husband is a driver. What does she work for? She said: "Do I work for money? Absolutely not. For me, work is a necessity of life."

### 十月革命使妇女地位起了巨大变化  苏联男女并肩建设共产主义

　　十月革命使妇女地位起了巨大变化
    苏联男女并肩建设共产主义
    本报莫斯科16日电　十月革命后四十年来苏联妇女的地位起了巨大的变化，她们和男子并肩进行社会主义和共产主义建设，她们处在和资本主义国家迥然不同的幸福环境里。苏联妇女委员会书记彼得罗娃对记者畅谈了这些情况。她说：
    在十月革命以前，俄国妇女在社会上和在家庭内都没有权。她们完全附属于丈夫。没有丈夫的允许，妻子不能更换住址。妻子没有自己的护照，她的名字挂在丈夫的护照上。由于工业的发展，妇女也有参加生产的，但大部分做粗活，在轻工业部门工作的也不多。十月革命后，苏维埃政权的第一批法令就给苏联妇女和男子平等的权利。妇女有了选举和被选举权。在家庭中男女地位也平等了。但是，正如列宁说过的，为了使妇女同男子真正平等，必须把妇女吸引到社会生产中去。因此在妇女中消灭文盲和进行职业教育。86％妇女是文盲的现象消灭了。现在妇女在生产各部门中占45％，在专家中占53％。在工业中有四十八万女工程师和技师。许多妇女当了工长、车间主任、厂长。在农村，集体化使妇女同男子真正平等了。从前，她们为丈夫、为婆婆工作。现在，她们有自己的劳动日报酬，她们是独立的。许多妇女成为生产队长、集体农庄主席、拖拉机手。受过高等教育的农艺师和兽医、饲畜技师中，妇女占40％。在文化、教育和科学方面，妇女不比男子逊色：医生中妇女占75％，教员中妇女占70％，科学工作人员中妇女占36％。
    苏联妇女是社会政治生活中的活跃人物。苏联最高苏维埃代表有三百四十八名是妇女；加盟共和国最高苏维埃代表有三分之一是妇女；地方苏维埃代表有40％是妇女。而美国国会议员中只有十六名妇女，参议员中只有一名妇女。在苏联，不少妇女担任全苏和加盟共和国的部长、副部长、部长会议副主席，如：拉脱维亚部长会议副主席阿力沙·文德斯特，格鲁吉亚部长会议副主席克沃查则，苏联卫生部长科夫里金娜。在党的工作方面，福尔采娃是苏共中央主席团委员，拉希木巴巴也娃是乌兹别克斯坦共产党中央书记。
    为了使她们能够参加生产，苏联创造了许多条件。在工厂、机关、学校，普遍设置食堂和冷食部；商店出卖浓缩的汤、菜的半制成品；对住宅实行煤气化和电气化；新盖的房屋都有冷水和热水；大量出产冰箱、洗衣机、吸尘器……这一切大大减轻了妇女的家务劳动。更重要的是广泛举办了幼儿园、托儿所、寄宿学校等等。在集体农庄有季节托儿所，它们在农忙季节为农妇们照顾三百万婴儿。苏联小学的低年级学生每天只上学四小时，而他们的母亲工作八小时。所以现在推行一种由学校继续代管他们四小时的作法。
    在资本主义国家，妇女劳动权利问题完全没有解决。妇女站在失业者大军的前列。妇女同工并不同酬，资本家利用这种不同酬来压低男工的工资。法国在过去共产党员当劳动部长时通过了同工同酬的法律。现在这条法律没有废除，但实际上女工工资低10％到30％。在第二次世界大战时期，美英为了使用妇女劳动力，也举办幼儿园。战后不需要妇女劳动力了，便把幼儿园关闭起来。资本家叫喊“妇女应当回到家庭去”的口号。在资本主义国家，妇女在家庭中也没有平等地位。妻子只有在丈夫同意之下才可以进工厂。妇女没有继承权。按法律，儿女属于父亲。在美国，妇女没有权上法庭当原告。
    彼得罗娃到过许多资本主义国家，她看到了上述一系列妇女受压迫的现象。她说：苏联妇女的眼界比资本主义国家妇女广阔得多。有一次，她问列宁格勒一位女工：“你为着什么工作？”这位女工觉得问题太奇怪了，回答说：“我不工作，做人便没有意思。我是社会的一员，这个社会主义社会进行着建设，我不能不参加到这个建设中去。”在阿塞拜疆有一位集体农庄女主席、获得两次社会主义劳动英雄称号的沙曼·加沙诺娃，从前，那里人们不尊重妇女，只尊重老人；现在，男子、老人都听从她的指挥。她的丈夫是一个司机。她为着什么工作呢？她说：“难道我为着钱工作？ 完全不是。对于我，工作是人生的必需”。
