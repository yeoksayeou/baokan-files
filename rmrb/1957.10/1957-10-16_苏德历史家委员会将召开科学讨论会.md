　　Soviet-German Historians' Committee to Hold Scientific Symposium
    The Soviet and East German Historians' Committees recently issued a joint announcement stating that a scientific symposium will be held in Leipzig in the second half of November this year. According to the protocol signed in Moscow on February 5 this year regarding the establishment of the Soviet-German Historians' Committee, the committee will hold two scientific symposiums each year in the Soviet Union and East Germany respectively. This symposium will have two central topics: 1. The impact of the Great October Socialist Revolution on Germany; 2. Basic tendencies in bourgeois historians' works on World War II. The first topic commemorates the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution, and the second topic aims to thoroughly critique bourgeois historical works on a specific subject.
    In order to conduct thorough and in-depth discussions, each major topic will be divided into three groups in addition to the plenary session. The first topic will be divided into: (1) The impact of the Great October Socialist Revolution on the launching of the German working class revolution; (2) The impact of the Great October Socialist Revolution on the formation process of the German proletariat's Marxist-Leninist combat party; (3) Germany's foreign policy during the Great October Socialist Revolution. The second topic will be divided into: (1) International relations on the eve of and during World War II and the interpretation of it by bourgeois historiography; (2) Bourgeois historiography on the course of World War II; (3) Bourgeois historiography on the anti-fascist resistance movement during World War II. The joint announcement has already drafted the report topics and speakers (approximately 50 people) who will speak at the conference and in the groups, including world-renowned historians and young historians.
    The Soviet-German Historians' Committee has sent invitations to historians and historical research and teaching institutions in various countries, hoping that this conference will become an international academic symposium. In addition to attempting to clarify major issues of common significance to the historical sciences of the Soviet Union and East Germany, the conference also hopes to promote the exchange of opinions among historians from various countries through off-site contacts, and to further strengthen beneficial international cooperation in the field of history.

　　苏德历史家委员会将召开科学讨论会
    苏联和民主德国历史家委员会最近发出联合通告，宣布将于本年11月下半月内在莱比锡召开科学讨论会。根据今年2月5日在莫斯科签署的关于成立苏德历史家委员会议定书的规定，委员会每年分别在苏联和民主德国举行两次科学讨论会。这次讨论会有两个中心题目：一、伟大的十月社会主义革命对德国的影响；二、资产阶级历史学家关于第二次世界大战的著作中的基本倾向。第一个题目是为纪念十月革命四十周年，第二个题目是针对某一专题彻底批判资产阶级的史学著作。
    为了进行细致深入的讨论，除全体大会外，每一大题目又分为三个小组。第一个题目将分成：（1）伟大的十月社会主义革命对德国工人阶级革命发动的影响；（2）伟大的十月社会主义革命对德国无产阶级的马列主义战斗政党形成过程的影响；（3）伟大的十月社会主义革命时期德国的对外政策。第二个题目将分成：（1）第二次世界大战前夕和期间的国际关系以及资产阶级史学对它的解释；（2）资产阶级史学论第二次世界大战的进程；（3）资产阶级史学论第二次世界大战期间反法西斯的抵抗运动。联合通告已拟定将在大会和小组上宣读的报告题目和报告人（约五十余人），其中有举世知名的历史家，也有年青的历史家。
    苏德历史家委员会已向各国历史家和历史研究和教学机构发出请柬，希望这次会议成为国际性的学术讨论会。会议除了企图阐明对苏德两国的历史科学有共同意义的重大问题之外，还希望通过会外接触促进各国历史家之间的意见交换，并进一步加强历史领域中的有益的国际合作。
