Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 11th - A large number of small and medium-sized factories and mines built in Sichuan Province this year have been put into production one after another.

It is estimated that by the end of this year, there will be more than 1,300 small coal kilns in the province, capable of producing more than 400,000 tons of coal; in addition, the total output value of non-ferrous metals and non-metals such as gold, copper, asbestos, and mica, which are mined on a small scale by the masses, will reach more than 16 million yuan.

At the beginning of this year, Sichuan Province, in accordance with the spirit of building the country through diligence and thrift, earnestly implemented the policy of combining large, medium, and small enterprises, and transferred nearly one-third of the investment in the province's industrial capital construction to develop small and medium-sized raw material industries urgently needed by the state. The 55 small coal kilns that resumed production in the Jiangjin area in the second quarter of this year can produce 100,000 tons of coal this year, equivalent to one-seventh of the total output of the area's original coal mines. A number of small raw material industries newly built and expanded in the Wanxian area this year have already started production. When all of these industries are completed, they will produce 30,000 tons of iron, 10,000 tons of sulfur, and a small amount of copper annually. The product quality of the six small iron plants that have been put into production among the fifteen small iron plants built in the Daxian area has been tested and proven to meet the specifications, and the cost of iron is a quarter lower than that of the province-owned iron plants. It is estimated that the annual production profit of these newly built iron plants can recover the entire investment.

While developing small and medium-sized raw material industries, Sichuan Province also organized forces to go to Xichang, Ya'an, Ganzi, and other places to investigate the resources and production of foreign trade materials. As of now, more than ten kinds of mineral resources with export and development value, such as gold, copper, lead, zinc, mica, and asbestos, have been discovered in these areas. At present, the local industrial departments are vigorously relying on the masses to exploit these resources locally with the original experienced miners as the technical force. It is estimated that the province can produce more than 3,000 taels of gold, more than 700 tons of zinc, more than 12,000 tons of asbestos, more than 180 tons of lead, and a small amount of mica, mercury, and copper this year.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 11th - In 1958, Guangxi Province will mine more than 67,400 taels of gold. This plan is nearly three and a half times more than the province's gold production last year. This was initially decided at a small mine planning meeting recently convened by the Guangxi Provincial Department of Industry.

Next year, the Provincial Department of Industry plans to invest one million yuan to build and expand 34 large and small gold mines such as Daming Mountain, Tiandong, Southwestern Guangxi, and Southeastern Guangxi. In addition, agricultural production cooperatives will be mobilized to use their surplus labor to carry out mass small-scale handicraft mining.

Guangxi Province is one of China's major gold-producing provinces. Recent extensive surveys have proven that its gold resources are abundant and of high quality, with deposits distributed in 30 to 40 counties including Tianyang, Tiandong, Shanglin, Wuming, Cangwu, and Tengxian.

　　加速发展原料工业　大力开采出口矿产
    四川新建大批中小型厂矿
    广西省明年计划开采黄金六万七千多两
    新华社成都11日电　四川省今年建设的大批中小型厂矿已经陆续投入生产。
    预计到今年年底，全省将有一千三百多个小煤窑，能生产煤四十多万吨；另外，组织群众小型开采的黄金、铜、石棉、云母等有色金属和非金属的总产值，将达到一千六百多万元。
    今年年初，四川省根据勤俭建国的精神，认真贯彻大、中、小企业相结合的方针，从省属工业基本建设的投资中，调出将近三分之一的款项，用来发展国家急需的中、小型原材料工业。江津专区今年第二季度恢复生产的五十五个小煤窑，今年即可产煤十万吨，相当于这个专区原有煤矿总产量的七分之一。万县专区今年新建和扩建的一批小型原材料工业，有的已经开工生产。这批工业全部完成以后，一年可产三万吨铁、一万吨硫磺和少量的铜。达县专区建设的十五个小铁厂，其中已投入生产的六个铁厂的产品质量，经过检验证明都符合规格，而且铁的成本比省属铁厂低四分之一。估计这批新建铁厂一年的生产利润就可以收回全部投资。
    四川省在发展中、小型原材料工业的同时，还曾经组织力量到西昌、雅安、甘孜等地，调查对外贸易物资的资源和生产情况。截至目前为止，这些地区已经发现具有出口和开发价值的金、铜、铅、锌、云母、石棉等十多种矿产资源。目前，当地工业部门正在大力依靠群众，以原来的老挖矿手作技术力量就地开采。预计今年全省可产三千多两黄金，七百多吨锌，一万二千多吨石棉，一百八十多吨铅，以及少量的云母、水银、铜等。
    新华社南宁11日电　1958年广西省将开采六万七千四百多两黄金。这个计划比去年全省黄金产量增长近三倍半。这是广西省工业厅最近召开的小矿计划会议初步决定的。
    明年，这个省的工业厅计划投资一百万元，新建和扩建大明山、田东、桂西南、桂东南等三十四个大小金矿。此外，还要发动农业生产合作社利用剩余劳动力进行群众性的小规模的手工业开采。
    广西省是我国主要产金省份之一。最近经过普遍调查，证明黄金资源丰富，而且品质高，矿藏分布在田阳、田东、上林、武鸣、苍梧、藤县等三、四十个县。
