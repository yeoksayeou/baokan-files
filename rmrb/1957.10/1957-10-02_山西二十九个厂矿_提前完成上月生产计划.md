As a National Day gift, workers in state-owned factories and mines in Shanxi Province have been vying to complete their production plans ahead of schedule or exceeding targets. It is understood that the state-owned enterprises in the province that have completed or exceeded their September plans ahead of schedule include: Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, Taiyuan Mining Machinery Plant, Taiyuan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Plant, Xishan Mining Bureau, Datong Mining Bureau, Yangquan Mining Bureau, Datong Cement Plant, North China Taiyuan Engineering Bureau, North China Datong General Company, and twenty other units. Since September, the anti-Rightist struggle among technical personnel in various state-owned enterprises has become more in-depth. Each brilliant victory in the anti-Rightist struggle has further encouraged the production enthusiasm of workers. At the same time, each enterprise has adopted many measures in production, mobilizing and organizing the broad masses of workers to carry out enthusiastic labor competitions. Workers have successively drawn up plans to dedicate achievements to National Day. Challenge letters and responses fill the walls of every workshop, and the dedication platforms are filled with new achievements. Coal production achievements are even more significant. The various mining bureaus under the Taiyuan Coal Administration Bureau completed the third quarter plan six days ahead of schedule on September 24, over-producing more than 300,000 tons of raw coal. In September alone, the over-production was 220,000 tons. The previously backward Datong Coal Mine's daily output in September increased by 20.57% compared with August, and 46% compared with the same period last year.
