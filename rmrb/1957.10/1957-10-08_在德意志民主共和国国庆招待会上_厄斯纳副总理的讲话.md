Dear Comrades and Friends:

Today we celebrate the eighth anniversary of the founding of the German Democratic Republic, the first peace-loving and truly democratic state in German history.

Our Republic was also born in the arduous struggle against the forces of world imperialism, especially against the monopoly capitalist forces of West Germany.

When Hitlerite fascism was crushed in 1945, the victorious powers, under the influence of the Soviet Union, promised the German people to maintain the unity of Germany on the condition of thoroughly eradicating German militarism and fascism.

We in eastern Germany immediately began to fulfill this obligation with the help of the Soviet Union by establishing an anti-fascist democratic system. In this way, we acquired the right to demand the preservation of German unity.

However, the Western powers violated the promises they made to the German people in 1945. In the areas they occupied, the power of monopoly capital was restored, and militarism and fascism were not eradicated, but were preserved and are now resurging. In order to contain the democratic influence from the East, West German monopoly capitalists, with the support of the Western occupying powers, pursued a policy of dividing Germany, which led to the establishment of the separate state of West Germany in 1949.

In response, the German Democratic Republic was established on October 7, 1949. The founding of the German Democratic Republic was not only a turning point in German history, but also a turning point in the history of all of Europe. A truly democratic state emerged in Germany, the breeding ground of European wars. In this country, the working class, in alliance with the peasants and other democratic forces, exercises political power. This country—like all worker-peasant states—has elevated the maintenance and consolidation of peace to the highest principle of its foreign policy. This German worker-peasant state maintains unbreakable friendship with all other socialist countries and, first and foremost, with the socialist Soviet Union and the People's Republic of china. The German Democratic Republic maintains economic and cultural relations with an increasing number of countries and has the closest affection for the Asian and African countries that are fighting for national independence and against imperialism.

The leading force in our country is the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, which is united with all communist and workers' parties in the world through the invincible science of Marxism-Leninism. Under the leadership of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, patriotic forces in Germany are united in the National Front of Democratic Germany to fight together against the imperialist policy of division and for the establishment of a united, peaceful, and democratic Germany. Under the leadership of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, the working people of the German Democratic Republic have begun to lay the foundations of socialism in both urban and rural areas.

It is understandable that this situation displeases the ruling circles of West German monopoly capital, and they incessantly attack the German Democratic Republic with fury. The more obvious it becomes that the approach of the two Germanys is the only way to open the path to the restoration of German unity, and that the establishment of a German Confederation as proposed by the government of the German Democratic Republic is the way out of the dead end led to by Bonn's policy of division, the more furiously the imperialists attack the German Democratic Republic in order to block this way out. They attempt to deny the existence of the German Democratic Republic. This policy is as absurd and untenable as the policy of some imperialist countries, headed by the United States, towards the People's Republic of China. Some imperialist countries are also unwilling to recognize your great People’s Republic and even deny the Chinese people their legitimate status in the United Nations. Facts have proven that this policy has been disastrous for the imperialists themselves. Everyone knows that the trade embargo against People's China instigated by the United States has been a miserable failure. Through their discriminatory policies against socialist countries, the imperialists have only caused these countries to unite more firmly with each other and more closely around the Soviet Union. Economic cooperation and mutual assistance among these countries have become a powerful factor in their development. The German Democratic Republic is very grateful for this assistance. Therefore, I would like to express my sincere gratitude for all the assistance and support that the Government of the People's Republic of China has given to the German Democratic Republic.

On the other hand, we are pleased that the German Democratic Republic can also contribute to the industrialization of People's China. The day before yesterday, we attended the opening ceremony of the radio equipment factory built with the help of the German Democratic Republic. In this factory, we met many excellent Chinese people who had studied in Germany and are now in leadership positions in the factory. It is exciting to see such proof of mutual cooperation and sincere friendship. This friendship, which connects us who are thousands of miles apart, is more powerful than all the intrigues of the imperialists. People connected by socialist ideas are more powerful than dollars and atomic weapons! Despite all the intrigues of the imperialists, the international prestige of the German Democratic Republic is constantly increasing due to its unwavering policy of peace and its economic boom.

Facts show that the imperialists' attempt to obliterate the existence of our country is doomed to failure. Anyone who is familiar with the laws of historical development knows that the forward march of socialist countries cannot be stopped. We will surely win, because we have not violated the tide of historical development.

The German Democratic Republic is the westernmost outpost of the socialist camp. In our own country, we are in constant contact with the enemy. The enemy has established atomic weapons depots in the western part of our homeland, and they are plotting to launch an attack from there against the socialist camp. However, imperialism is no longer powerful enough to force humanity to accept its will. We know that war is no longer inevitable. Together with all socialist countries and the entire world peace camp, we are fighting for an immediate halt to all atomic weapons testing, for a ban on the use of weapons of mass destruction, and for effective disarmament.

Knowing that such powerful friends as the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China are standing with us fills us in the German Democratic Republic with courage, strength, and confidence in victory.

Please allow me to raise my glass,

To the unbreakable friendship between the people of Germany and China,

To the unity of the socialist camp led by the Soviet Union,

To the friendly cooperation of the peoples of all countries,

To world peace,

To the Chinese people and their glorious Communist Party,

To the health of Comrade Mao Zedong!

### 在德意志民主共和国国庆招待会上  厄斯纳副总理的讲话

    在德意志民主共和国国庆招待会上
    厄斯纳副总理的讲话亲爱的同志们和朋友们：
    今天我们庆祝德国人民历史上第一个爱好和平的和真正民主的国家——德意志民主共和国成立八周年。
    我们的共和国也是在反对世界帝国主义势力、特别是反对西德垄断资本势力的艰苦斗争中诞生的。
    1945年希特勒法西斯被粉碎的时候，战胜国在苏联的影响下答应德国人民在彻底根除德国军国主义和法西斯主义的条件下维持德国的统一。
    我们在德国东部立即着手在苏联的帮助下实现这个义务，建立了反法西斯民主制度。这样我们就获得了要求保持德国统一的权利。
    但是，西方国家违背了它们于1945年向德国人民所作的诺言。在它们占领的地区内，垄断资本的势力重又恢复了，军国主义和法西斯主义没有被根除，而是被保存下来，今天重又在抬头。为了抑制来自东部的民主影响，西德垄断资本家在西方占领国的支持下推行一种分裂德国的政策，这种政策导致了1949年西德分立国家的成立。
    作为对它的回答，德意志民主共和国于1949年10月7日建立了。德意志民主共和国的成立，不仅是德国历史上的转折点，而且也是全欧洲历史的转折点。在德国这个欧洲战争的策源地出现了一个真正民主的国家。在这个国家里，工人阶级同农民和其他民主力量结成联盟，行使着政权。这个国家——如同所有的工农国家一样——把维护和巩固和平提高成为它的外交政策的最高原则。这个德意志工农国家同所有其他的社会主义国家、首先是同社会主义的苏联和中华人民共和国保持着牢不可破的友谊。德意志民主共和国同越来越多的国家保持着经济和文化关系，并且对为民族独立、反对帝国主义而斗争的亚非国家怀有最亲密的感情。
    我们国家的领导力量是德国统一社会党，它通过不可战胜的马克思列宁主义科学同世界上所有的共产党和工人党团结在一起。德国爱国力量在德国统一社会党的领导下团结在民主德国全国阵线中，共同为反对帝国主义的分裂政策，争取建立一个统一、和平和民主的德国而进行斗争。德意志民主共和国的劳动人民在德国统一社会党的领导下已经开始在城乡建立社会主义的基础。
    这种情况使西德垄断资本统治集团感到不快，他们狂怒不息地攻击德意志民主共和国，这是可以理解的。只有通过两个德国的接近才能为恢复德国统一开辟道路，德意志民主共和国政府所建议的成立德意志联邦是走出波恩分裂政策所导向的死胡同的出路，这一点愈明显，帝国主义者就愈加狂怒地攻讦德意志民主共和国，以便堵塞这条出路。他们企图否认德意志民主共和国的存在。这种政策正如以美国为首的一些帝国主义国家对中华人民共和国的政策一样荒谬和站不住脚。一些帝国主义国家也不愿意承认你们的强大的人民共和国，甚至拒绝中国人民在联合国组织中的合法地位。事实已经证明，这种政策使帝国主义者自己遭殃。大家都知道，美国所策动的对人民中国的贸易禁运遭到了悲惨的失败。帝国主义者通过他们对社会主义国家的歧视政策，只是促使这些国家相互之间团结得更加巩固，更加紧密地团结在苏联的周围。这些国家之间的经济合作和互助，已成为它们的发展的强大因素了。德意志民主共和国十分感谢这种援助。因此，我特别想对中华人民共和国政府所给予德意志民主共和国的各方面的援助和支持表示衷心的感谢。
    另外一方面，德意志民主共和国也能对人民中国的工业化有所贡献，这使我们感到满意。前天我们参加了德意志民主共和国帮助建设的无线电器材厂的开工典礼。我们在这个工厂里遇到了许多出色的中国人，他们曾在德国学习过，现在担任着该厂的领导工作。能够看到这种互助合作和真挚友谊的证明，使人感到兴奋。这种把远隔几千公里的我们联结在一起的友谊，比起帝国主义者的一切阴谋诡计要更为有力。由社会主义思想连结起来的人们比美元和原子武器更有力！尽管帝国主义者的一切阴谋，德意志民主共和国的国际威信由于它坚持不渝的和平政策和经济高涨而日益提高。
    事实表明，帝国主义者抹杀我们国家存在的企图注定是要失败的。谁要是熟悉历史发展的规律，就会知道，社会主义国家的向前迈进是无法阻挡的。我们一定会胜利，因为我们没有违背历史发展的潮流。
    德意志民主共和国是社会主义阵营最西部的前哨。我们在自己的国家里同敌人不断接触。敌人在我们祖国的西部建立了原子武器贮藏所，他们策划从那儿出发向社会主义阵营发起进攻。但是，帝国主义已经不再是强大得足以强使人类接受它的意志了。我们知道，战争已经不再是不可避免的了。我们同所有社会主义国家和整个世界和平阵营一起，为立即停止原子武器的一切试验、为禁止使用大规模毁灭性武器、为有效的裁军而斗争。
    知道有苏联和中华人民共和国等这样强大的朋友和我们站在一起，就会使我们德意志民主共和国充满勇气、力量和胜利信心。
    请允许我举杯，
    为德中两国人民的牢不可破的友谊，
    为以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结，
    为各国人民的友好合作，
    为世界和平，
    为中国人民及其光荣的共产党，
    为毛泽东同志的健康，干杯！
