　　The Soviet Union Will Always Be the Banner of Human Progress and the Defense of Peace
　　Li Dequan
    The entire Chinese people and the working people of the world are warmly celebrating the 40th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution together with the Soviet people. The October Revolution opened a new era in world history of the collapse of capitalism and the victory of socialism, demonstrating the great victory of Marxism-Leninism. The October Revolution in 1917 changed the face of the world and the course of world history. The victory of the October Revolution first broke a gap from within the all-encompassing capitalist system and established the world's first socialist state of the dictatorship of the proletariat.
    The victory of the October Socialist Revolution not only satisfied the demands of the broad working people in the Soviet Union for peace, land, and bread, but also greatly inspired and encouraged the oppressed and exploited working masses of the world in their struggle for freedom and independence, strengthening their confidence in victory. The victory of the October Revolution had a tremendous impact on China. Prior to this, patriotic and progressive Chinese intellectuals had continuously striven to seek the truth for saving China from the struggle experience of Western bourgeois revolutions, but their efforts had repeatedly failed. The sound of the October Revolution brought the attention of China's advanced patriotic people to the struggle of the Russian people. From the struggle of the Russian workers and peasants, they began to see the road, direction, and future of the Chinese revolution. As Chairman Mao Zedong pointed out in an article summarizing this historical period: "For a hundred years, the outstanding figures of the deeply suffering Chinese nation have struggled and sacrificed themselves, advancing wave upon wave, exploring the truth of saving the country and the people, which is both admirable and tragic. But it was not until after the First World War and the Russian October Revolution that they found Marxism-Leninism, the best truth, as the best weapon for liberating our nation, and the Communist Party of China was the initiator, propagandist, and organizer who took up this weapon. Once the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism is integrated with the specific practice of the Chinese revolution, the face of the Chinese revolution is completely renewed." Chairman Mao Zedong made a more profound elaboration on the great guiding role of Marxism-Leninism in the transformation of China's destiny in the article "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship," which reads: "The salvoes of the October Revolution brought us Marxism-Leninism. The October Revolution helped the advanced elements of the whole world and also of China, to use the proletarian world outlook as an instrument for observing the destiny of the country and reconsidering their own problems. Follow the path of the Russians—that was the conclusion."
    Under the correct leadership of the rapidly growing and maturing Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao Zedong, the revolutionary working class launched heroic strike struggles in the cities against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism, severely hitting the rule of the reactionary regime, making people of all strata across the country deeply feel the greatness of the working class's strength, and inspiring the courage and determination of the broad masses of people to participate in the revolutionary struggle; in the rural areas reached by the Red Army, the landlord regime was overthrown, satisfying the poor peasants' thirst for land and greatly developing the revolutionary forces; after victoriously repelling the Kuomintang reactionaries' four encirclement and suppression campaigns, the fifth anti-encirclement campaign suffered a defeat due to the mistake of dogmatism, and then the world-shaking 25,000-li Long March was conducted, and a revolutionary headquarters was established in Yan'an to thoroughly carry out and complete the bourgeois democratic revolution.
    After a long and tortuous road of countless hardships, the Communist Party of China finally led the revolutionary Chinese people to victoriously complete the bourgeois democratic revolution. The victory of the Chinese working class's struggle was due to the fact that the working class's party—the Communist Party of China—creatively combined Marxism-Leninism with China's specific conditions and formulated a policy to guide the Chinese revolution from victory to victory. The Chinese democratic revolution developed vigorously under this correct leadership, and finally achieved a historic victory in 1949, establishing a socialist system. From then on, the Chinese revolution entered a higher socialist stage.
    From the very beginning of our socialist construction, the Soviet people have given us enthusiastic help and support in all aspects. A large number of material resources and outstanding experts from the Soviet Union have been put into our fiery construction. The great friendship of the Soviet people in helping our country's construction is fully demonstrated in Comrade Khrushchev's speech at the celebration of the fifth anniversary of our country's founding on September 30, 1954. Comrade Khrushchev said with deep emotion: "We Soviet people believe it is our fraternal duty to help our friends and brothers—the Chinese people—to strengthen their people's democratic state, and to build a socialist society. Precisely because of this, every achievement you make in the construction of New China fills the Soviet people with boundless joy. The Chinese people can be assured that the Soviet people will continue to be their reliable and loyal friends and will vigorously help and support them in their struggle for the further consolidation and development of the People's Republic of China."
    Only the socialist Soviet Union can so sincerely and selflessly give great help to its brother countries. We sincerely thank the Communist Party and government of the Soviet Union and the Soviet people for their great help to us. The militant friendship between the Soviet and Chinese people is as solid as a rock because we have a common economic and ideological basis, we have a common goal of struggling for socialism and communism, and we also have a common desire to strive for world peace. The friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people is a powerful guarantee of human peace.
    After the October Revolution, the Soviet Union once existed for a long time as the only socialist country in the world. The Soviet Union consolidated its country's regime in a tenacious struggle with the enemy. After World War II, socialism went beyond the scope of one country and became a world system. Many countries in Europe and Asia got rid of the capitalist system and established people's democratic countries, and China is one of them. The outcome of World War II aggravated and deepened the crisis of the imperialist colonial system. The great victory of the Chinese revolution fatally hit the system of colonialism, prompting more countries striving for and realizing freedom and independence to intensify their revolutionary actions. The imperialist colonial system is already on its last legs and falling apart. The emerging socialist countries, like the rising sun, have formed a world system as a powerful camp. The total area of these countries' territories accounts for 26% of the world's area, their population accounts for about 35% of the world's population, and their industrial output accounts for about one-third of the world's industrial output. We firmly believe that the course of the times will one day ruthlessly push capitalism off the stage of history, and the power of history will inevitably crush the last wall of capitalism. The victory of the Great October Socialist Revolution and the formation of the socialist world system powerfully demonstrate that the victory of socialism throughout the world is the inevitable result of historical development.
    The Soviet Union is a peace-loving country, not only because peace is one of the fundamental principles of the socialist system, but also because in the past forty years, in all the wars against aggression and in the resolute struggle for freedom, peace, and socialism, the Soviet people have shed the most blood and suffered more severe destruction and damage than any other country in the world, and the sacrifices and losses are incalculable. Only those who have deeply experienced the pain of war truly understand the great significance of peace. The demand for peace has penetrated into the hearts of every Soviet person. In its contribution to the cause of world peace, the Soviet government has been making persistent and unremitting efforts to safeguard human peace since the founding of the country. In the early days of the victory of the October Revolution, Lenin said: "...We need peaceful construction, we must carry out peaceful construction, and we will contribute all our energy and all our lives to peaceful construction." For forty years, any diplomatic measures taken by the Soviet government have been based on this unwavering Leninist principle of serving peace. To strive for peace is the basis of Soviet diplomacy. From all the activities carried out by the Soviet government, we can clearly see the great efforts made for peace. The Soviet Union's demand for peace is determined by the socialist system, as Comrade Khrushchev once again pointed out in a recent conversation with American journalist Reston: "...There is no class in our country that is obsessed with plundering other countries' lands and enslaving other countries' people, and keen on profiting from the arms race."
    What socialist countries value most is people, and people are the most precious wealth in all our wealth; what capitalist countries value most is money, and people are appendages of money. In order to pursue the greatest profit in money, the ruling groups of capitalist countries do not hesitate to take the heavy sacrifices brought to mankind by war as the price. And we socialist people, in order to ensure the safety of human life, in order to protect the huge material wealth created by the labor of generations of people for thousands of years from being destroyed, we spare no effort to carry out the struggle to defend world peace. No one with a conscience in the world can deny this fact.
    The Soviet Union is the banner of human peace! The Soviet Union is a strong fortress for defending world peace!
    As we celebrate the 40th anniversary of the victory of the October Socialist Revolution, we have all reviewed the great achievements made by the Soviet Union in the past forty years, which makes us look forward to our bright future with greater confidence. The working people of the world should further unite closely, and on the solid foundation of the brilliant achievements already made in socialism, hold high the glorious banner of Marxism-Leninism, be more united, work harder, and make more progress!

　　苏联永远是人类进步与保卫和平的旗帜
　　李德全
    全中国人民和全世界劳动人民都在同苏联人民一起热烈地庆祝伟大十月社会主义革命四十周年。十月革命在世界历史上开辟了资本主义崩溃、社会主义胜利的新纪元，它显示了马克思列宁主义思想的伟大胜利。1917年十月革命改变了世界的面貌，同时也改变了世界历史的进程。十月革命的胜利首先从无所不包的资本主义体系内部打开了一个缺口，建立起世界上第一个无产阶级专政的社会主义国家。
    十月社会主义革命的胜利，不但满足了苏联境内广大劳动人民对于和平、土地、面包的要求，而且大大地启示和鼓舞了世界上受压迫、受剥削的劳动群众为争取自由和独立所进行的斗争，加强了他们胜利的信心。十月革命的胜利，对中国发生了巨大的影响。在这以前，具有爱国思想的中国先进知识分子，曾不断努力地向西方资产阶级革命的斗争经验中去寻求解救中国的真理，但是他们的努力先后都告失败了。十月革命的炮声使中国先进的爱国志士把注意力转到了俄国人民的斗争上去，从俄国工农群众的斗争中，他们开始看到了中国革命的道路、方向和前途。正如毛泽东主席在总结这一历史时期的文章中所指出的：“灾难深重的中华民族，一百年来，其优秀人物奋斗牺牲，前仆后继，摸索救国救民的真理，是可歌可泣的。但是直到第一次世界大战和俄国十月革命之后，才找到马克思列宁主义这个最好的真理，作为解放我们民族的最好的武器，而中国共产党则是拿起这个武器的倡导者、宣传者和组织者。马克思列宁主义的普遍真理一经和中国革命的具体实践相结合，就使中国革命的面目为之一新。”马克思列宁主义对中国命运的转变所起的伟大指导作用，在“论人民民主专政”一文中，毛泽东主席做了更深刻的阐述，文章中写道：“十月革命一声炮响，给我们送来了马克思列宁主义。十月革命帮助了全世界的也帮助了中国的先进分子，用无产阶级的宇宙观作为观察国家命运的工具，重新考虑自己的问题。走俄国人的路——这就是结论。”
    在迅速壮大和成熟的中国共产党与毛泽东主席的正确领导下，革命的工人阶级在城市中进行了英勇的反对帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的罢工大斗争，严重地打击了反动政权的统治，使全国各阶层的人民都深深感觉到工人阶级力量的伟大，鼓舞了广大人民参加革命斗争的勇气和决心；在红军所到的农村中，打垮了地主政权，满足了贫苦农民对土地的渴求，大大发展了革命势力；在胜利地打退了国民党反动派的四次围剿后，由于教条主义的错误使第五次反围剿遭到了失败，于是又进行了举世震惊的二万五千里长征，在延安建立了为彻底进行和完成资产阶级民主革命的革命司令部。
    经过了无数艰难困苦的漫长曲折道路以后，中国共产党终于领导革命的中国人民胜利完成了资产阶级民主革命。中国工人阶级斗争的胜利，是由于工人阶级的政党——中国共产党创造性地把马克思列宁主义和中国的具体情况相结合，制定出指导中国革命从胜利走向胜利的方针。中国的民主革命就是在这种正确的领导下蓬蓬勃勃地发展起来的，并且终于在1949年获得了历史性的胜利，确立了社会主义的制度。从此，中国革命就进入了一个更高的社会主义阶段。
    从我国社会主义的建设一开始，苏联人民就从各方面给予我们热情的帮助和支持。来自苏联的大批物资资源和优秀专家，都投入了我们火热的建设中。苏联人民帮助我国建设的伟大友谊，充分表现在1954年9月30日赫鲁晓夫同志在我国建国五周年的庆祝大会上所发表的演说中，赫鲁晓夫同志感人至深地说：“我们苏联人认为，帮助我们的朋友和兄弟——中国人民来加强他们的人民民主国家和建设社会主义社会，是自己应尽的兄弟的责任。正因为这样，你们在新中国的建设中所取得的每一项成就，都使苏联人感到无限的欢欣。中国人民可以坚信：苏联人民今后也将是他们可靠的和忠实的朋友，并将大力帮助和支持他们为中华人民共和国的进一步巩固和发展而斗争。”
    只有社会主义的苏联，才能这样真诚无私地大力帮助它的兄弟国家。我们衷心地感激苏联共产党和政府以及苏联人民给我们的巨大帮助。苏联和中国人民之间的战斗友谊有如磐石般巩固，因为我们有着共同的经济基础和思想基础，我们有着为社会主义、共产主义而奋斗的共同目标，我们也有着为世界和平而努力的共同愿望。中苏两国人民的友好，是人类和平的有力保障。
    十月革命以后，苏联一度曾长期地做为世界上独一无二的社会主义国家存在，苏联是在与敌人做顽强的斗争中巩固了自己国家的政权的。在第二次世界大战以后，社会主义便越出了一国的范围而成为世界体系。欧洲和亚洲的许多国家摆脱了资本主义制度，建立了人民民主国家，中国就是其中的一个。第二次世界大战的结局，加重和加深了帝国主义殖民体系的危机，中国革命的伟大胜利，致命地打击了殖民体系的制度，促使更多为争取和实现自由、独立的国家更加加紧了革命的行动。帝国主义的殖民制度已经是日没穷途，分崩离析了。新兴的社会主义国家，却像旭日东升一样，作为一个强大的阵营组成了世界体，这些国家领土的总面积已占世界面积的26％，它们的人口约占全世界人口的35％，而工业产量约占世界工业产量的三分之一。我们坚信，时代的进程总有一天会毫不留情地把资本主义推出历史舞台，历史的力量必然要冲垮资本主义的最后一堵墙壁。伟大十月社会主义革命的胜利和社会主义世界体系的形成，有力地说明了社会主义在全世界的胜利是历史发展的必然结果。
    苏联是热爱和平的国家，这不仅因为和平是社会主义制度的根本原则之一，还因为四十年来在历次反对侵略的战争中、在坚决争取自由和平与社会主义的斗争中，苏联人民流过最多的鲜血，遭受了比世界上任何一个国家都更严重的摧残和破坏，牺牲和损失是无法估计的。只有深刻经验过战争痛苦的人，才真正懂得和平的伟大意义。和平的要求已经深入到每一个苏联人民的心中，在对世界和平事业的贡献中，苏联政府从建国以来，始终为维护人类和平进行着持久不懈的努力。十月革命胜利的初期，列宁就曾说过：“……我们需要和平建设，我们必须进行和平建设，而且我们将把我们的所有精力和所有生命贡献给和平建设。”四十年来，苏联政府所采取的任何一项外交措施，都是根据为和平服务的这一坚定不移的列宁原则。为和平而奋斗，这是苏联的外交基础。我们从苏联政府所进行的一切活动中，都可以明显地看到为和平所做的巨大努力。苏联要求和平是由社会主义制度所决定的，正如赫鲁晓夫同志最近在与美国记者赖斯顿的谈话中再一次所指出的：“……我们国家里没有那种醉心于掠夺别国土地和奴役别国人民以及热衷于从军备竞赛中获利的阶级。”
    社会主义国家最重视的是人，人是我们一切财富中最宝贵的财富；资本主义国家最重视的是金钱，人是金钱的附庸，为了追求金钱上的最大利润，资本主义国家的统治集团不惜以战争所带给人类的惨重牺牲做为代价。而我们社会主义的人们，为了保障人类生命的安全，为了保护千百年来世世代代人民的劳动所创造的巨大物资财富不遭毁灭，我们不遗余力地进行着保卫世界和平的斗争。世界上任何一个有良心的人，都不能否认这样一个事实。
    苏联是人类和平的旗帜！苏联是保卫世界和平的坚强堡垒！
    在庆祝十月社会主义革命胜利四十周年的时候，我们都回顾了一下苏联四十年来所获得的伟大成就，这使我们更加满怀信心地展望着我们美好的未来。全世界劳动人民应该更进一步紧密团结，在社会主义已经获得辉煌成就的雄厚基础上，高举着马克思列宁主义的光辉旗帜，更团结，更努力，更进步！
