    The Twentieth Century Slave Deception Case

    According to a report by the American "National Guardian," at the end of August, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People investigated the "Twentieth Century Slave Deception Case" in New York State, exposing the fact that farmers in New York State used false promises such as high wages, superior living conditions, and travel expense reimbursement to lure a large number of Black slaves from states such as Alabama, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, and South Carolina. The investigation report stated that these deceived slaves lived in dilapidated houses and were constantly underfed. The farmers not only demanded that the slaves repay their travel expenses but also forged IOUs to force the slaves to work for them endlessly; sometimes, even children were forced to work. Those who resisted were either sent to concentration camps surrounded by barbed wire and guarded by soldiers or driven out and left to wander the streets.

    二十世纪的奴隶欺骗案
    据美国“国民前卫报”报道，8月底，全国有色人种协进会调查了纽约州的“二十世纪的奴隶欺骗案”，揭露了纽约州的农场主用较高的报酬、优厚的生活条件和发给旅费等虚假的诺言，从亚拉巴马、乔治亚、佛罗里达、密士失比、南卡罗来纳等州诱骗大量的黑人奴隶的事实。调查报告说，这些受骗的奴隶住的是即将倒塌的房屋，终日不得温饱。农场主不但要奴隶偿还旅费，并且还伪造借据强迫奴隶无止境地为他们劳动，有时小孩也被迫参加劳动；反抗者有的被送入用铁丝网围起来的、有卫兵看守的集中营，有的被赶出，流落街头。
