Intensifying Nuclear War Preparations; Supporting Turkish Aggression
US and UK Issue Belligerent Joint Statement
Xinhua News Agency, London, 26th - This agency's reporters Peng Di and Qian Xing report: Macmillan and Eisenhower have decided to drag the world into a long-term, dangerous nuclear arms race.

The Anglo-American leaders issued a joint statement at the conclusion of their three-day meeting in Washington. The core content of the statement is to ensure that the United States and Britain will cooperate more closely in nuclear war preparations, and that Eisenhower will request Congress to amend the Atomic Energy Act so that the United States can cooperate closely with Britain and other Western countries. After pointing out that the Soviet Union is "able to achieve great material successes" in "scientific applications," the statement said that the United States and Britain will "seek to strengthen the Atlantic alliance's efforts in scientific research and invention."

In order to dispel the doubts of other Western countries and stem their neutral tendencies, and in order to firmly tie them to the Anglo-American nuclear war chariot, the statement even said that the concept of national self-sufficiency is outdated, emphasizing that there should be "mutual dependence" in military affairs. The statement also called for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council meeting scheduled for December this year to be a meeting of "special nature."

Regarding the Middle East, the declaration reiterated Anglo-American support for Turkey. Newspaper reports say that the two heads of state agreed that negotiations with the Soviet Union are out of the question at present.

On this issue, Macmillan seems to have yielded to Eisenhower. He reiterated his support for Turkey without openly criticizing the Eisenhower Doctrine. The British proposal for jointly providing the Middle East with "economic aid" was not included in the declaration. At a press conference before leaving Washington, Macmillan admitted that the joint statement was "not very clear" on the Middle East issue. He explained that this was because the talks were only intended to formulate a "basic outline" rather than "find current solutions" to a particular issue.

The London "Worker's Daily" pointed out in an editorial today entitled "Partners in Crime" that British and American scientists will cooperate for war, not for peace. Macmillan and Eisenhower are not concerned about disarmament, but about intensifying the arms race. Their statement on the Middle East is adding fuel to the fire.

The "Worker's Daily" continued, "The British people do not want Macmillan and Eisenhower to participate in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council to prepare for war. They want them to meet with Khrushchev at a summit to strive for peace. People hope to solve the Middle East problem through great power agreements and a ban on arms imports. They hope that scientists from all countries will cooperate to save lives rather than destroy them."

### 加紧核战争准备　支持土耳其侵略  美英发表好战的联合声明

    加紧核战争准备　支持土耳其侵略
    美英发表好战的联合声明
    据新华社伦敦26日电　本社记者彭迪、钱行报道：麦克米伦和艾森豪威尔决定要把世界拖入长期的、危险的核军备竞赛中。
    英美首脑在华盛顿举行的历时三天的会谈结束时发表了一项联合声明。声明的中心内容是保证英美将在核战争准备上更密切地进行合作，而且艾森豪威尔将要求国会修改原子能法，以便美国同英国以及其他西方国家能密切地合作。声明在指出苏联在“科学应用”方面“能够取得巨大的物质成就”以后，表示英美两国将“要求加强大西洋组织在科学研究和发明方面的努力”。
    为了驱散其他西方国家的疑虑和阻止它们的中立趋势，以及为了把它们牢牢地拴在英美的核战争的战车上，声明竟说国家自足自给的概念已经过时，强调应当在军事方面“互相依赖”。声明并且要求使定于今年12月份举行的北大西洋公约组织理事会会议成为一次具有“特殊性质”的会议。
    关于中东，宣言中重申英美支持土耳其。据报纸消息说，两国首脑一致认为：目前同苏联举行谈判是谈不到的。
    在这个问题上麦克米伦似乎已经向艾森豪威尔屈服，他重申支持土耳其而没有公开批评艾森豪威尔主义，英国提出的共同给予中东以“经济援助”的意见没有列入宣言中。麦克米伦在离开华盛顿以前的记者招待会上承认联合声明对中东问题谈得“不很清楚”，他解释说，这是因为会谈只是要制定一个“基础轮廓”，而不是对某一个问题“找出当前的解决办法”。
    伦敦“工人日报”今天在一篇题为“合伙犯罪”的社论中指出，英国和美国的科学家将要为了战争进行合作，而不是为了和平。麦克米伦和艾森豪威尔所关心的不是裁军，而是加紧军备竞赛。他们发表的关于中东问题的声明是火上加油。
      “工人日报”继续说，“英国人民不要麦克米伦和艾森豪威尔参加北大西洋公约组织理事会去准备战争。他们要他们在最高级会议上会见赫鲁晓夫来争取和平。人民希望通过大国协议和禁止输入武器来解决中东问题。他们希望一切国家的科学家进行合作来挽救生命而不是毁灭生命。”
