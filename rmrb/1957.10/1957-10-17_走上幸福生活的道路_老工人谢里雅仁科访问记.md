　　Walking the Road to a Happy Life
    ——A Visit with Old Worker 谢里雅仁科 (Xiè lǐ yǎ rén kē)
    By Our Correspondent Cheng Guangrui
    To understand the changes in the lives of Soviet workers over the past forty years, we came to the home of old worker 谢里雅仁科 (Xiè lǐ yǎ rén kē) at 11 Nikoli Street in Kiev. Before we even arrived, his family had already enthusiastically come out to greet us. 谢里雅仁科 (Xiè lǐ yǎ rén kē) and his wife stood at the door, and his daughter-in-law stood beside them, holding his little granddaughter’s hand. 谢里雅仁科 (Xiè lǐ yǎ rén kē) led us into his room to sit down. It was two o'clock in the afternoon, and the sunny room was filled with sunshine. A vase of fresh flowers on the table gave off a fragrance, and a sweet aroma of jam wafted from the cupboard.
    This old worker is seventy-five years old this year, with a full head of silver hair, but he is very energetic. We asked him to talk about his life and experiences before and after the victory of the revolution. Because of his age and the long years, many old events have retreated deep into his mind. 谢里雅仁科 (Xiè lǐ yǎ rén kē) recalled as he spoke haltingly about the path he has walked in his life.
    “Talking about the past, you wouldn’t believe the hardships and difficulties,” 谢里雅仁科 (Xiè lǐ yǎ rén kē) began.
    谢里雅仁科 (Xiè lǐ yǎ rén kē) was born in 1882 in a worker's family in Kiev. His father was a handyman, and his mother was a cleaning worker. At that time, they lived on the lower floor of a two-story building on Prochov Street, with windows level with the street, dark and damp. They ate black bread every day. When 谢里雅仁科 (Xiè lǐ yǎ rén kē) was fifteen years old, he barely finished three years of primary school. His father sent him to the factory as an apprentice. He only went for one day and ran home the next day. His father was so angry that he beat him, but still sent him back to the factory.
    The following year, 1898, he heard someone giving a speech during a church service, talking about how the working class should fight for their own liberation. This was the first time he knew that workers also had their own cause. Later, someone introduced him to booklets such as "Who Exploits Whom." Soon he joined the Kiev "Association for the Liberation of the Working Class." Also in this year, representatives from St. Petersburg, Moscow, Minsk, and other places who participated in the First Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party came to Kiev to hold a meeting, but unfortunately, they were all arrested. Several young comrades in their factory held a meeting at their own residence and printed leaflets that night, preparing to distribute them on the street. Sixteen-year-old 谢里雅仁科 (Xiè lǐ yǎ rén kē) joined everyone in hiding the leaflets on his body. Before leaving, everyone drank a glass of vodka, wishing each other victory. That night, they braved the heavy snow to distribute the leaflets throughout the district.
    谢里雅仁科’s (Xiè lǐ yǎ rén kē) revolutionary activities were discovered by the factory, and he was soon fired. After that, he managed to get a job as a riveter at the Kiev Ship Repair Factory and continued his revolutionary activities.
    In 1904, 谢里雅仁科 (Xiè lǐ yǎ rén kē), who was twenty-two years old, got married. At that time, his monthly salary was only a few rubles, barely enough for the two of them to eat bread. Their first son died shortly after birth due to illness. At this point, his wife interjected, saying, "The difficulties of life at that time are unimaginable now."
    In 1905, the first Russian revolution broke out. The workers of Kiev actively participated in this struggle. 谢里雅仁科 (Xiè lǐ yǎ rén kē) was a representative of the Kiev Soviet of Workers and Peasants at that time. This revolution failed. 谢里雅仁科 (Xiè lǐ yǎ rén kē) and fourteen other revolutionary participants were deported by the Kiev authorities. Five years later, in 1911, he returned to Kiev. The following year, the year his eldest son was born, he entered the mechanical factory as a fitter. Later, he worked in this factory for decades until he retired this January. In 1955, during the commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the first Russian revolution, 谢里雅仁科 (Xiè lǐ yǎ rén kē) was awarded the Order of the Red Banner of Labor.
    The victory of the Great October Revolution brought new hope to the Russian people. The days that 谢里雅仁科 (Xiè lǐ yǎ rén kē) had long fought for finally arrived. However, during the economic recovery period at the beginning of the revolution, their lives were still difficult. 谢里雅仁科 (Xiè lǐ yǎ rén kē) recalled that the workers in Kiev had to work from seven in the morning to six in the evening. He himself wore a torn suit, and his wife wore a patched dress. They only had one bed at home. Because life was difficult, they had to sell the bed to buy potatoes. In 1922, their second son was born, and they sold the quilt to buy milk for the child. "We didn't have money, but we had confidence," 谢里雅仁科 (Xiè lǐ yǎ rén kē) said. "We believed that the Soviet regime would definitely be consolidated!"
    谢里雅仁科 (Xiè lǐ yǎ rén kē) had only studied for three years before the October Revolution. After the victory of the October Revolution, he entered the factory school to study at the age of forty. Later, the factory sent him to the Kiev Metallurgical Technical School for two years. He studied very well, and his skills improved. After returning to the factory, he was promoted to technician.
    During the Soviet era, 谢里雅仁科’s (Xiè lǐ yǎ rén kē) sons and daughters received higher education. The life of their family, like all Soviet families, has also gotten better and better. However, in June 1941, dark clouds suddenly appeared in the sky, and the German fascist army invaded the Soviet Union.
    The enemy's invasion aroused the boundless anger of 谢里雅仁科 (Xiè lǐ yǎ rén kē), who had fought for the Soviet regime all his life. He immediately sent his children to the front line one by one: the eldest son to do ground crew work, the second son to be a gunner, and the daughter also participated in front-line work. When his second son left home for the front line, 谢里雅仁科 (Xiè lǐ yǎ rén kē) repeatedly told his son to remember three things: first, not to betray the motherland; second, to severely attack the enemy; third, not to go home without orders. 谢里雅仁科 (Xiè lǐ yǎ rén kē) sent away his children, and he and his wife went to the Urals with the factory. There, in order to increase production to support the front line, the workers worked day and night. Sometimes 谢里雅仁科 (Xiè lǐ yǎ rén kē) didn't leave the factory for a week. His wife also worked in the collective farm, busy all day long, and didn't go home for several days.
    In November 1943, the days of suffering in Kiev ended, and the Soviet army liberated the city. The following year, in August 1944, 谢里雅仁科 (Xiè lǐ yǎ rén kē) and his wife returned to Kiev with the factory. At this time, their eldest son and second son also returned from the front line. A separated family restarted a new life. Kiev suffered serious damage from the enemy. The factory where 谢里雅仁科 (Xiè lǐ yǎ rén kē) worked was also destroyed, leaving only broken walls. His family returned to Kiev and had to live in the unbombed house of his eldest son in the suburbs. As Kiev rapidly recovered and was rebuilt, they moved back to the city. The family lived in a large room of thirty square meters. This year, on May 1st, they moved to this building at 11 Nikoli Street. It is much more spacious here, with a total of fifty-four square meters. When talking about the house, the old lady also interjected to praise how good their new house is: "It's close to the park, the transportation is convenient, the windows face the sun, the light is sufficient…."
    On the 22nd of that month, when they moved into the new house, it was 谢里雅仁科’s (Xiè lǐ yǎ rén kē) seventy-fifth birthday. That day, a banquet was prepared in this room, and the whole family celebrated the old man's birthday. The factory director and the party committee secretary also came. 谢里雅仁科’s (Xiè lǐ yǎ rén kē) twelve-year-old grandson 巴夫纳 (Bā fū nà) also recited a birthday poem for his grandfather. 谢里雅仁科 (Xiè lǐ yǎ rén kē), who rarely drank alcohol, could not help but drink a toast with everyone that day.
    谢里雅仁科 (Xiè lǐ yǎ rén kē) retired this year. He lives with his second son's family. The second son's monthly salary is 1,500 rubles, and his daughter-in-law's monthly salary is also 700 or 800 rubles. His daughter-in-law's younger sister also lives with them, and her monthly salary is 700 rubles. Plus his own preferential pension of 650 rubles per month, the family's total monthly income is 3,500 to 3,600 rubles. They spend 1,500 rubles each month for living expenses. Almost more than half of the money can be saved in the bank.
    谢里雅仁科 (Xiè lǐ yǎ rén kē) said to us: The reason why our Soviet workers can live such a happy life now, live in such good houses, and wear such beautiful clothes is inseparable from the hard work and efforts of our Soviet workers over the past few decades. When we live such an abundant life now, we will never forget the difficult years we have experienced in the past and the hard days of building our Soviet motherland.
    This year, almost the entire 谢里雅仁科 (Xiè lǐ yǎ rén kē) family has the opportunity to take a vacation. The second son has just returned from vacation, and the eldest son has gone to the North Caucasus for vacation. The old man also wants to travel, but because this year is the fortieth anniversary of the October Revolution, he is writing his memoirs and has to wait until he finishes writing them. Speaking of vacations, the old lady spoke again, saying that she had worked at home for a year and should also have the right to take a vacation. She is planning to go to Moscow in September.
    Before our conversation ended, the old lady抢先(qiǎngxiān) said before the old man: "In short, the changes in these decades have been too great. We have come through difficulties and are now living happily." Then, she led us to visit their house. She pointed to one room inside and said, "This is where the son, daughter-in-law, and granddaughter live." Pointing to the middle room, she smiled and said, "This is where the old man and old woman live." There is also another room outside where the daughter-in-law's younger sister lives. Each room is decorated neatly and exquisitely. Finally, she led us to visit the kitchen, where there was still a pot of fruit on the stove ready to make jam. When we were about to say goodbye, 谢里雅仁科 (Xiè lǐ yǎ rén kē) turned on the TV and asked us to watch it. At this time, the TV showed a group of Young Pioneers who were singing. 谢里雅仁科 (Xiè lǐ yǎ rén kē) couldn't help but join in.
    Walking out of 谢里雅仁科’s (Xiè lǐ yǎ rén kē) house, on the road, this vivid impression made people unable to forget for a long time: an old worker with white hair -- a strong warrior who came from a difficult and rugged road, today sings with the red scarves for the happy present and the happy future of the motherland...

　　走上幸福生活的道路
    ——老工人谢里雅仁科访问记
    本报记者　程光锐
    为了了解苏联工人四十年来生活的变化，我们来到基辅市尼科里大街十一号老工人谢里雅仁科的家里，当我们还没有到达时，他一家人早就热情地出来迎接我们了，谢里雅仁科和他的妻子站在门口，他的儿媳妇牵着他的小孙女也站在旁边。谢里雅仁科把我们引到他的房间里坐下来。这时正是下午两点钟，这间向阳的房子里满屋阳光，桌子上的一瓶鲜花散着芳香，食橱里溢出一股果子酱的香甜的味道。
    这位老工人今年已经七十五岁了，满头银发，可是精神十分健旺。我们请他谈谈他革命胜利前后的生活和经历。岁数大了，年代久了，许多旧事都躲到脑子深处去了。谢里雅仁科一面回忆着，一面断断续续地谈着他一生走过的道路。
    “谈起过去的生活，那些艰难困苦，你们是不会相信的。”谢里雅仁科开头就这样说。
    1882年谢里雅仁科生在基辅的一个工人家庭里。他父亲是个杂工，母亲是个打扫工人。当时他们一家住在普罗乔夫大街的一座两层房的下一层，窗户和大街相平，阴暗而潮湿。他们每天吃的是黑面包。谢里雅仁科十五岁那年，勉强读完了三年制小学。父亲把他送到工厂里去当学徒。他只去了一天，第二天就跑回家来了。父亲气得打了他一顿，仍旧把他送到工厂里去。
    第二年，1898年，有一次在做礼拜的时候，他听到有人演说，讲的是工人阶级怎样去争取自己的解放。这是他第一次知道工人还有自己的事业。以后又有人介绍他读“谁剥削了谁”之类的小册子。不久他就参加了基辅的“工人阶级解放斗争协会”。也是这一年，彼得堡、莫斯科和明斯克等地参加俄国社会民主工党第一次代表大会的代表们到基辅来开会，不幸全部被捕了。他们工厂里的几位青年同志就在自己的住处开会，当夜印了传单，准备分发到街上。十六岁的谢里雅仁科也和大家一起，把传单藏在身上。临行前，大家喝了一杯伏特加酒，预祝胜利。这一夜，他们冒着大雪，把传单散遍了全区。
    谢里雅仁科的革命活动被工厂发觉，不久工厂就把他开除了。之后，他又设法到基辅的船舶修理厂去当铆工，并且继续他的革命活动。
    1904年，二十二岁的谢里雅仁科结了婚。当时他每月的工资没有几个卢布，只够两个人吃面包。他们的第一个儿子出生不久就病死了。谈到这里，他的妻子在旁边插口说：“当时生活的困难现在是无法想像的。”
    1905年，俄国爆发了轰轰烈烈的第一次革命。基辅的工人们积极地参加了这次斗争。谢里雅仁科是当时基辅工农苏维埃的代表。这次革命失败了。谢里雅仁科和其他十四名革命参加者，被基辅当局驱逐出境。五年之后，1911年他才又回到基辅来。第二年，他的大儿子出生那年，他又进了机械工厂当装配工人。后来他一直在这个工厂里工作了几十年，直到今年1月才退休回家。1955年纪念俄国第一次革命五十周年的时候，谢里雅仁科荣获了劳动红旗勋章。
    伟大的十月革命的胜利给俄国人民带来了新的希望。谢里雅仁科长期来争取的日子终于到来了。可是，在革命胜利之初的经济恢复时期，他们的生活仍然是困难的。谢里雅仁科回忆说：当时基辅的工人要从早晨七点钟工作到晚上六点钟。他自己穿的是破西装，他的妻子穿的也是补了补绽的连裙衫。他家里只有一张床。生活困难，只好把床卖了去买土豆。1922年，他们的二儿子出生了，他们又把被子卖了，去买牛奶给孩子吃。“没有钱，但是却有信心，”谢里雅仁科说：“我们相信苏维埃政权一定会巩固起来！”
    谢里雅仁科在十月革命前只读过三年书。十月革命胜利后，他四十岁的时候，才又进了工厂的学校去学习。以后工厂又送他到基辅冶金技术学校去学习了两年。他学习的成绩很好，技术提高了，回厂后就被提升为技师。
    在苏维埃政权年代里，谢里雅仁科的儿子和女儿们都受到了高等教育。他们一家的生活，像所有的苏联家庭一样，也越来越好了。可是，1941年6月，天空中突然出现了乌云，德国法西斯军队进攻苏联了。
    敌人的侵略引起为苏维埃政权战斗一生的谢里雅仁科的无比的愤怒。他立刻把自己的儿女们一个个送上前线：大儿子去做地勤工作，二儿子去当炮手，女儿也参加了战地工作。当他的二儿子离家上前线的时候，谢里雅仁科一再叮嘱自己的儿子要记住三件事：第一，不准背叛祖国；第二，要狠狠地打击敌人；第三，没有命令，不准回家。谢里雅仁科送走了儿女们，自己也和妻子随着工厂到乌拉尔去了。在那里，为了增加生产支援前线，工人们夜以继日地工作着，谢里雅仁科有时一个星期也不离开工厂一次。他的妻子也在集体农庄里工作，整天忙碌着，也是好几天都不回家。
    1943年11月，基辅苦难的日子结束了，苏联军队解放了这个城市。第二年，1944年8月，谢里雅仁科和他的妻子又随着工厂回到了基辅。这时，他们的大儿子和二儿子也都从前线回来了。一个离散的家庭重新开始了新的生活。基辅遭到敌人严重的破坏。谢里雅仁科工作的工厂也被破坏得只剩下断墙残壁了。他一家回到基辅，只好住到城郊未被炸毁的大儿子的房子里。随着基辅迅速的恢复建设，他们才又搬回城里来。一家人住在一间三十平方公尺的大房间里。今年5月1日，他们才搬到尼科里大街十一号的这座大楼里来。这里宽敞多了，总共有五十四平方公尺。谈到房子，老太太也在一旁插口夸赞他们的新房子怎样好：“离公园近，交通方便，窗户向阳，光线充足……。”
    就在搬进新住宅那个月的22日，逢到谢里雅仁科的七十五岁寿辰。那天在这个房间里备了酒宴，全家为这位老家长祝寿。工厂的厂长和党委书记也都来了。谢里雅仁科十二岁的大孙子巴夫纳还为祖父朗诵了一首祝寿诗。平时很少喝酒的谢里雅仁科，这一天也禁不住同大家干了一杯。
    谢里雅仁科今年退休了。他和二儿子一家住在一起。二儿子每月工资是一千五百卢布，二儿媳妇每月工资也有七八百卢布，二儿媳妇的妹妹也和他们住在一起，她每月的工资是七百卢布，再加上他自己每月六百五十卢布的优抚金，全家每月收入一共三千五六百卢布。每月拿出一千五百卢布来作生活费。差不多有一半以上的钱可以作为储蓄存入银行。
    谢里雅仁科对我们说：我们苏联工人所以能过现在这样幸福的日子，住这样好的房子，穿这样漂亮的衣服，都是和我们苏联工人几十年来艰苦奋斗努力生产分不开的，我们过着现在这样丰裕的生活时，我们永远也不会忘记我们过去所经历过的艰难岁月和建设我们苏维埃祖国时的苦难日子。
    今年谢里雅仁科一家几乎全家都有休假的机会。二儿子刚刚休假回来，大儿子又去北高加索休假了。老头儿也想出去旅行，可是，因为今年是十月革命四十周年，他正在写回忆录，只好等写完再说了。谈到休假，老太太又说话了，她说她在家里工作了一年，也应当有休假权，她准备9月里到莫斯科去。
    在我们的谈话结束之前，老太太又抢在老头儿前面说：“总之，这几十年的变化太大了。我们已经从艰难中走了过来，现在生活幸福了。”接着，她又领着我们参观了他们的房子。她指着里边一间说：“这是儿子、儿媳妇和小孙女住的。”又指着中间这间笑着说：“这就是老头儿和老太婆住的。”外面还有一间是儿媳妇的妹妹住的。每间房子都布置得整洁而精致。最后，她又领着我们参观了厨房，这里炉子上还放着一锅准备做果酱的水果呢。我们要辞别的时候，谢里雅仁科又打开电视机请我们看。这时电视中映出一群少年先锋队员，他们正在唱歌，谢里雅仁科也情不自禁地应和起来。
    从谢里雅仁科家中走出来，在路上，这个鲜明的印象使人久久不能忘记：一个白发苍苍的老工人——从艰难崎岖的道路上走过来的坚强的战士，今天和红领巾一起歌唱祖国幸福的今天，幸福的未来……。（附图片）
