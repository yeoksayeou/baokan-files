Xinhua News Agency, October 21st, Istanbul Dispatch: The Turkish army continues to prepare for war on the Syrian border. The acting Chief of Staff of the Turkish Army, General Fazıl Mengüç, personally inspected the border on the 19th.

According to the Syrian newspaper "Al-Alam," Turkish troops conducted suspicious movements on the Syrian border on the evening of the 20th. American planes have been spotted at Turkish airfields near the Syrian border.

At the same time, the Turkish government is still trying to cover up its aggressive conspiracy. According to Western news agencies, on the 19th and 20th, the Turkish government separately told the governments of Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Lebanon that it had no intention of invading Syria.

The United States is helping Turkey to cover up. The U.S. Chargé d'Affaires in Damascus was ordered on the 20th to notify the Syrian government that the U.S. government did not doubt the sincerity of Turkey's assurance that it had no plans to invade Syria.

The Iraqi government also issued a statement on the 20th saying that it was "deeply convinced" that Turkey had no intention of aggression against Syria. Iraq is one of the countries that the United States is trying to use against Syria.

Xinhua News Agency, October 21st, Istanbul Dispatch: The leader of the Turkish Republican People's Party and former Prime Minister İsmet İnönü said on October 20th that the Turkish army's "demonstrations" on the Syrian-Turkish border were "inappropriate and unnecessary."

İnönü said this while giving a campaign speech.

In the last week before the October 27th general election, Turkey's four largest parties—the ruling Democratic Party, the opposition Republican People's Party, the Freedom Party, and the National Republican Party—are fiercely campaigning. The opposition parties sharply criticized the Democratic Party for failing to extricate the country from the economic crisis during its seven years in power, with domestic prices soaring, and a lack of daily necessities such as coffee and medicine, which are important beverages for the Turkish people, and for passing anti-democratic publication and assembly bills.

    土耳其一面备战一面掩饰
    前总理伊诺努指责土军在叙边境示威
    据新华社21日讯　伊斯坦布尔消息：土耳其军队继续在叙利亚边境上备战。土耳其代理陆军参谋长法齐·曼古克将军19日亲自到边境进行了视察。
    另据叙利亚“旗帜报”报道，土耳其军队20日晚间在叙利亚边境进行了可疑的移动。已经发现在靠近叙利亚边境的土耳其飞机场上有美国的飞机。
    同时，土耳其政府仍旧企图掩盖它的侵略阴谋。据西方通讯社消息，19日和20日，土耳其政府分别向埃及、沙特阿拉伯和黎巴嫩政府表示，它没有侵略叙利亚的意图。
    美国正在帮助土耳其进行掩饰。美国驻大马士革代办在20日奉命通知叙利亚政府说，关于土耳其所提出的它并没有侵略叙利亚的计划这种保证，美国政府并不怀疑它的诚意。
    伊拉克政府也在20日发表声明说，它“深信”土耳其对叙利亚并没有侵略意图。伊拉克是美国企图利用来反对叙利亚的国家中的一个。
    新华社21日讯　伊斯坦布尔消息：土耳其共和人民党领袖、前总理伊斯麦特·伊诺努10月20日说，土耳其军队在叙利亚和土耳其边境上的“示威”是“不合时宜的和不必要的”。
    伊诺努是在发表竞选演说时这样说的。
    在10月27日大选前的最后一个星期，土耳其的四个最大的政党——执政的民主党，在野的共和人民党、自由党和国家共和党正在激烈地进行竞选。反对党尖锐指责民主党在它执政的七年中没有使国家摆脱经济危机，国内物价飞涨，特别是土耳其人的重要饮料咖啡和药品等日用必需品缺乏，并且通过反民主的出版和集会法案等。
