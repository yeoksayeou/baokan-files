    Opinions on Zhang Yongmei's "The Eighth Route Army Returns"
    To the Editor:
    I don't think "The Eighth Route Army Returns" is a good poem.

    The poem says that since the founding of the country, that is, since we seized power, we have completely forgotten the masses, saying that we have "been gone for seven years, without sending any news." It says that since entering the city, we have completely forgotten the countryside where the Party lived for a long time and grew stronger, and forgotten the hard-working farmers. It says that our cars do not go to "remote and desolate places," that we wear new clothes and are afraid of getting them dirty by cattle and sheep, that the way we contact the masses is unpleasant, and that we are used to living in buildings and are unwilling to live in "thatched cottages and bamboo fences." It says that we are so satisfied with our achievements that we have become muddled, and that we are "overwhelmed" by "documents and briefcases," becoming bureaucratic and disregarding the life and death of the hard-working people.

    This is exaggerating and distorting the facts.

    The poem also says that we don't even care if the farmers' irrigation ditches are dry and the "rice seedlings are withering in the fields," and we don't care if people are "clamoring to withdraw from the cooperative." It says that we turn a deaf ear to the fact that village cadres "force the grain-deficient households to jump into wells" and "imprison young people alive." It says that we don't see the "difficulties" of the masses, don't listen to the "grievances" of the masses, and don't give the masses ideas.

    This is scolding us for being "ungrateful," saying that we have forgotten the places and people who "treated our wounds" and "washed our bloody clothes," and forgotten the past when we ate thin porridge and distributed land. It says that we are not even as good as "geese," which look back three times to the south when they fly north?

    These sentences occupy most of the poem, forming a negative and disappointed atmosphere. Although there are some positive sentences later, they fail to eliminate the basic emotion of negating everything in the whole poem.

### 对张永枚的“八路回来了”的意见

专栏：读者中来

    对张永枚的“八路回来了”的意见编辑同志：
    我认为“八路回来了”不是一首好诗。
    诗里说我们从建国以来，也就是取得了政权以来，完全忘掉了群众，说我们是“一去七年，总不捎来消息”。说我们从打入城以后就全忘掉了党长期生活在并在那里成长和壮大了的农村，忘掉了劳苦的农民。说我们的汽车，不去“穷乡僻野”，说我们穿新衣，怕牛羊弄脏了，说我们联系群众的话不好听，说我们住惯了楼房而不愿住“茅屋竹篱”。说我们满足于已得的成就到了昏迷的程度，说我们被“文件与皮包”“压住了”，成了不顾劳苦人民死活的官僚主义者。
    这是夸大和歪曲了事实。
    诗里还说我们就连农民的水渠干了，“秧苗瘐在田里”也不管，有人“吵闹着要退出社去”也不管，说村干部“把缺粮户逼去跳井”“把年青人活活禁闭”了也不闻不问。说我们不看群众的“难处”，不听群众的“委屈”，说我们不给群众出主意。
    这是骂我们“忘恩负义”，说我们忘记了“养伤”、“洗血衣”的地方和人民，忘掉了过去吃稀饭、分田地。说我们连“雁”都不如，雁往北飞还三次回头望南方呢？
    这些字句在整个诗里占了大半篇幅，形成了一片消极失望的气氛，虽然后面也有一些有积极意义的句子，但并没能消除全诗的否定一切的基本情绪。
