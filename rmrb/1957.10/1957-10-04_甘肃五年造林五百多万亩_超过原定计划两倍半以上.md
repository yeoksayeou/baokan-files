Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 2nd. During the first Five-Year Plan period, Gansu Province afforested a total of more than 5.48 million mu, exceeding the original plan by more than two and a half times. In some places, a scene of "barren mountains clad in green, dry gullies yielding springs" has already appeared.

The original forest area of Gansu Province accounted for only 2.3% of the total land area. Due to the lack of forests, the vast land was not protected, and natural disasters such as water, drought, wind, and sand occurred continuously. At the same time, timber reserves could not meet people's needs. Therefore, in the past five years, Gansu Province has systematically cultivated various trees. Especially after agricultural cooperativization, the afforestation area expanded rapidly. Last year alone, the province afforested more than 3 million mu.

The natural conditions in various parts of Gansu Province are different, and afforestation work is adapted to this. Soil erosion in the eastern and central mountainous areas is serious, with sayings such as "nine droughts in ten years" and "dry mountains without rain, muddy water flowing with rain." In order to cooperate with the fundamental treatment of the Yellow River and change the face of drought, in the past five years, more than 3.8 million mu of slope protection forests, gully fixation forests, and bank protection forests have been planted on the bare mountains, bare gullies, and alluvial river banks of the main tributaries of the Yellow River, such as the Jing River, Wei River, and Zuli River, controlling soil erosion over an area of ​​20,000 square kilometers. On the long wind and sand line in the northwest, shifting sands used to bury farmland and villages. In the past five years, nearly 1 million mu of windbreak and sand-fixation forests have been planted on this line, greatly reducing the harm of wind and sand. In order to fundamentally control the sand disaster, in 1956, after planning and design by the state, it was decided to build a large sand-control forest belt, starting from Yanchi in the east and ending at Hala Lake in Dunhuang, with a length of 2,200 kilometers and an area of ​​330,000 hectares, and combining it with the construction of 94 branch and trunk forest belts with a total length of 3,400 kilometers. The state has established sand control afforestation experimental farms and guidance stations in Zhongwei, Minqin, Anxi, Jinta, Jingtai and other counties. By the first half of 1957, various places had mobilized the masses to afforest more than 670,000 mu, with 110 sections of strip afforestation, with a total length of more than 1,100 kilometers. In the Longnan mountainous area, where the climate is mild and rainfall is abundant, various economic forests have also begun to be systematically cultivated in recent years.

In addition, Gansu Province has also carried out large-scale forest management and mountain closure for forest cultivation. In the past five years, the province has closed mountains for forest cultivation over an area of ​​more than 16 million mu, exceeding the original plan by 5%.

    甘肃五年造林五百多万亩
    超过原定计划两倍半以上
    新华社兰州2日电  甘肃省在第一个五年计划期间共造林五百四十八万多亩，比原定计划超过两倍半以上。有些地方已经呈现出“荒山穿绿衣、干沟出泉水”的景象。
    甘肃省原有的森林面积仅占土地总面积的2.3％。由于森林缺少，广大土地没有庇护，水、旱、风、沙等自然灾害不断发生。同时，木材蓄积量也不能满足人们的需要。因此，五年来甘肃省有计划地营造各种林木。特别是农业合作化以后，造林面积迅速扩大，仅去年一年全省就造林三百多万亩。
    甘肃省各地自然情况不一，造林工作是与此相适应的。东部和中部山区水土流失严重，有“十年九旱”、“无雨干山头，有雨泥水流”的说法。为了配合根治黄河和改变干旱面貌，五年来这些地区的黄河主要支流泾河、渭河和祖厉河等流域的光山秃岭、裸露沟壑和冲积河岸，已经营造护坡林、固沟林和护岸林等三百八十多万亩，控制水土流失面积两万平方公里。西北部漫长的风沙线上，过去流沙常常埋没农田和村庄。五年来这一线共营造防风防沙林近一百万亩，大大减少了风沙的危害。为了根治沙患，1956年国家经过规划设计，确定东起盐池、西至敦煌哈拉湖，营造一条长两千二百公里，面积三十三万公顷的防沙大林带，并结合营造九十四条总长三千四百公里的支干林带。国家已经在中卫、民勤、安西、金塔、景泰等县设立防沙造林试验场和指导站。到1957年上半年，各地已经发动群众造林六十七万多亩，带状造林一百一十段，总长一千一百多公里。在气候温和、雨量较多的陇南山区，最近几年来也已经开始有计划地营造各种经济林。
    此外，甘肃省还大规模地进行了森林经营和封山育林工作。五年来全省封山育林的面积共一千六百多万亩，超额5％完成原定计划。
