    Soil and Water Conservation Saves Taogou Village
    Guo Dongyuan, Member of Taogou Village Agricultural Cooperative, Huai'an County
    Hard Days
    Taogou Village is located in a mountain gully in the northwest of Huai'an County, Hebei Province, with twelve households. During the period of Japanese occupation, the dense forests were severely damaged, turning green mountains into barren ridges. Soil and water were lost in large quantities from the good land on the slopes and the fertile fields on the banks of the gullies. Out of the village's 360 mu of cultivated land, more than 140 mu were lost, and 50 mu of silted land became dry land. In addition, the Kuomintang reactionaries plundered, looted, and killed, and the masses had no heart to cultivate. The land became increasingly barren, and the yield became lower and lower. In good years, the highest yield per mu was just over 60 jin. The twelve households in the village, with 67 people, could not even get half a year's worth of food, not counting the payment of various taxes. Most of the labor force frequently worked for landlords in neighboring villages, living a life of hunger and cold with half chaff and half vegetables. By 1948, the village had accumulated more than 100 dan of high-interest rice, making life unbearable. In the year before liberation, six households planned to go down the mountain to find a way out, while the remaining six households worried: starving is unbearable, but moving is unaffordable.
        Seeing the Sun
    Just when the masses in Taogou Village were at a dead end, they were liberated in the winter of 1948 and saw the sun. After liberation, under the leadership of the Party and the government, the farmers here first organized a mutual aid group of six households to carry out soil and water conservation work. That year, they built two flood control dams, dug twenty-three drainage ditches on mountain slopes, and seven silt-inducing irrigation ditches, protecting 100 mu of land and silting up 14 mu. In addition to intensive cultivation and increased fertilization, the average yield per mu in the autumn was 120 jin, more than double the yield per mu before liberation, and 18 dan (5,400 jin) more grain than the six households farming individually. The six individual farmers saw with their own eyes the fact that organizing could produce more grain, and they all actively requested to join the mutual aid group. By the spring of 1953, all of them had transformed into an agricultural production cooperative. After collectivization, the difficulties of scattered management were overcome. In addition to managing the land, the cooperative could invest a lot of labor force every year (730 in the previous year and 4,000 this year) to carry out various kinds of soil and water conservation, and continue to wage a resolute struggle against nature.
        Creating Conditions for Increased Production
    Vigorous soil and water conservation has become a habit of the masses in Taogou Village, and has achieved great results. From the beginning of 1953 to August 1957, a total of 44 mu of terraced fields, 13 mu of flat land, 22 stone flood control dams, 5,130 meters of earth ridges, 58 drainage ditches, 23 earth gully dams, 87 stone gully dams, 11 mu of depression land, 6,057 fish-scale pits, and 3,863 meters of contour ditches were built.
    The above projects protected a total of 187 mu of land, irrigated 13.3 mu, and silted up 46.16 mu of good beach land, expanding the cultivated land by a total of 81 mu. In addition, the masses gradually paid attention to "relying on the mountains for food, and nourishing the mountains," and from 1952, 3,100 mu of mountains were closed for grass cultivation, 150 mu of barren mountains were planted with apricot trees, 137 mu were planted with poplar, willow, apricot, and pear fruit trees, and 21 mu of barren mountains were planted with sweet clover. After management and maintenance, weeds and shrubs have grown on the stone cliffs of Dananbei, Hulongliang, and Donggoubei in the village. Many trees and fruit trees have gradually grown up, showing a green appearance. The above projects preserved soil and water, eased the slope of cultivated land, and enhanced water storage capacity and fertility, creating conditions for increased agricultural production.
        Having Abundant Harvests
    Before liberation, Taogou Village had only six old donkeys and thirty-three thin sheep. Now there are thirteen donkeys, two mules, two hundred and twenty-one sheep, twenty-nine pigs, and some rabbits and chickens. With the increase of livestock, the amount of fertilizer applied has also increased. In 1953, the average amount of fertilizer applied per mu was more than 2,200 jin, and in 1955 it increased to 3,200 jin. This year, the amount of fertilizer applied has increased to more than 4,000 jin, an increase of nine times compared to the 450 jin of fertilizer applied per mu before liberation. In addition, with the use of mountain floods for silting and intensive cultivation, agricultural production has increased significantly. The average yield per mu was 159 jin and 5 liang, more than one and a half times the 60 jin per mu before liberation, and 21 jin more than in 1955, with many high-yield records appearing. This year, the 6.5 mu of high-yield millet in Yangluwan produced 590 jin of grain per mu, an increase of 390 jin compared to the normal yield of 200 jin. This year, the four mu of yams in Shitoupo averaged 2,508 jin per mu, equivalent to 627 jin of grain per mu, an increase of 417 jin compared to the normal yield of 210 jin.
        Lives are Improved
    With the continuous increase in production, the poor days of Taogou Village are not only a thing of the past, but they can also sell surplus grain to the state. In 1953, the village sold 23,800 jin of surplus grain to the state. In 1954, although it suffered from natural disasters, it still sold more than 13,000 jin of surplus grain to the state. By 1955, they had paid off all the debts accumulated over the years, and also purchased nearly 1,500 yuan worth of cotton and cloth. Now the village has increased to eighteen households with seventy-eight people, and every family has new felt blankets and floral quilts. Seventeen new fur coats have been made, and eleven new houses, one breeding station, and ten horse sheds have been built. In the past, four bachelors, Guo Youyuan, Guo Tiansheng, and Guo Julian, etc., also married wives and established families. Due to the improvement of living standards, the members all demanded to learn culture and voluntarily hired teachers to open a private primary school. Children and some members learn culture in this school.

    水土保持救了桃沟村
    怀安县桃沟村农业社社员　郭栋元
    难熬的日子
    桃沟村在河北省怀安县西北上的山沟里，有十二户人家，在日寇统治年代，密茂的林木遭到严重破坏，绿山变为秃岭。坡腰好地和沟岸良田上的水土大量流失掉了。全村三百六十亩耕地损失了一百四十多亩，五十亩淤地变成了旱田。再加上国民党反动派抢掠烧杀，群众无心耕作，地力越来越瘦，产量越来越低，好年景亩产最高六十多斤。全村十二户，六十七口人，不算交纳各种税收，一年也得不到半年的吃粮。大部分劳力经常给邻村地主扛活，过着半糠半菜的饥寒生活。到1948年全村累下高利贷米百余大石，日月难熬。解放前一年有六户盘算下山找活路，其余六户愁着：饿着受不了，搬又搬不起。
        见到了太阳
    桃沟村群众正在无路可走的时候，1948年冬得到了解放，见到了太阳。解放后在党和政府的领导下，这里的农民先由六户群众组织了一个互助组，开始进行水土保持工作。当年他们修建了防洪坝二道，挖山坡地排水渠二十三道，淤地引洪水渠七道，护地一百亩，淤地十四亩，加上精耕细作，增施肥料等，秋后平均每亩产量一百二十斤，超出解放前亩产量的一倍，比单干的六户多打十八大石粮食（五千四百斤）。六户单干农民亲眼看到组织起来多打粮食的事实，都积极要求加入了互助组。到1953年春全体转成了农业生产合作社。合作化以后，克服了分散经营的困难，除经营土地外，每年能投入很多劳动力（前年是七百三十个，今年是四千个），开展多种多样的水土保持，继续和大自然进行坚决的斗争。
        创造增产条件
    桃沟村大力进行水土保持，已成为群众的一种习惯，并取得了很大成绩。从1953年开始至1957年8月，共修梯田四十四亩、平地十三亩、石防洪坝二十二道，打地埂五千一百三十公尺，筑排水渠五十八道，修土谷坊二十三道、石谷坊八十七道，挖堰窝地十一亩、鱼鳞坑六千零五十七个、水平沟三千八百六十三公尺等。
    上述工程总共护地一百八十七亩，引水浇地十三亩三，淤出好滩地四十六亩一分六，共扩大耕地八十一亩。再加上群众逐渐注意“靠山吃山，吃山养山”，从1952年起，封山养草三千一百亩，荒山播种杏树一百五十亩，植杨、柳、杏、梨果树一百三十七亩，荒山播种草木樨二十一亩。经过管理养护，村内大南背、虎龙梁和东沟背的石崖上，都长起了杂草、灌木。许多乔木和果树已逐年成长起来，出现了绿化面貌。上述工程保住了水土，改缓了耕地坡度，增强了蓄水能力和肥沃程度，给农业增产创造了条件。
        有了丰盛收获
    解放前桃沟全村只有老驴六头，瘦羊三十三只。现在已有驴十三头，骡子二头，羊二百二十一只，猪二十九口，和一些兔、鸡。随着牲畜的增加，施肥量也提高了，每亩地1953年平均施肥二千二百多斤，1955年提高到三千二百斤。今年的施肥量更提高到四千多斤，比解放前每亩施肥四百五十斤增加了九倍。加上利用山洪放淤和精耕细作，农业产量显著提高。平均亩产一百五十九斤五两，超过解放前每亩六十斤的一倍半多，比1955年增加了二十一斤，出现了许多高额丰产纪录。羊路湾的六亩半丰产谷子，今年每亩产粮五百九十斤，比常年产量二百斤增加了三百九十斤。石头坡的四亩山药，今年平均亩产二千五百零八斤，每亩折粮六百二十七斤，比常年产量二百一十斤增加了四百一十七斤。
        生活得到改善
    随着生产不断提高，桃沟村贫困日月不但一去不复返了，而且能有余粮卖给国家。1953年全村卖给国家余粮二万三千八百斤，1954年虽然遭到自然灾害，还卖给国家余粮一万三千多斤。到1955年，他们把历年塌下的外债还清了，还购买了将近一千五百多元的棉花和布匹。现在全村已增加到十八户七十八口人，家家铺上了新毡子，盖上了花被子，光新皮袄就做了十七件，还建了新房十一间、饲养站一处，马棚十间。过去郭有元、郭天生和郭巨连等四个单身汉也娶了媳妇，建立起家庭。由于生活提高，社员们都要求学习文化，自动聘请教师，开办了一座民办小学。儿童和一些社员在这个学校里学文化。
