Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 24th: With the rapid development of industrial construction, approximately nine hundred new cities have appeared on the map of the Soviet Union in the forty years since the October Revolution. The total number of cities nationwide has increased from 666 in 1913 to 1,569 in April 1956, more than doubling.

In these decades, no other country in the world has seen the emergence of so many new cities as quickly as the Soviet Union. Even Soviet geographers have been unable to mark the new cities that have appeared in recent years on general maps in time.

The new cities of the Soviet Union were almost all built during the Five-Year Plan era, starting in 1928. These cities are distributed throughout the Soviet Union, and many of them are already well-known at home and abroad. Before the revolution, the Donbas, the most important coal mining and metallurgical industrial center in Russia, had only five cities, but now it has increased to fifty-six. Twenty-five years ago, Kramatorsk was just a small village, but now it has developed into an important heavy machinery manufacturing industrial center in the Soviet Union. Another new city, Druzhkovka, was developed from a village after 1940, and it now produces half of the Soviet Union's total output of electric locomotives and two-thirds of its underground coal mine transportation equipment. In the famous industrial region of the Urals, more than thirty cities were built during the pre-war Five-Year Plans alone. The most famous of these is Magnitogorsk, which by the beginning of last year had developed into a large industrial center with a population of over 280,000. In distant Siberia, dozens of new cities such as Stalinsk, Igarka, Norilsk, and Angarsk appeared during the Five-Year Plan era. The city of Stalinsk was originally a small village, which developed after the construction of the Kuznetsk Iron and Steel Combine. By the beginning of last year, its population had increased from more than 3,000 to 347,000. Igarka is now the largest port, timber industry center, and cultural center on the Yenisei River in the far north of Siberia, but twenty-seven years ago, it was just a wilderness where polar bears occasionally roamed.

In the Far East region of the Soviet Union, Komsomolsk-on-Amur is well-known far and wide. However, the site of this modern industrial city with a population of over 100,000 was a desolate village twenty-five years ago.

While new cities are constantly emerging, old cities throughout the Soviet Union are also developing rapidly and becoming increasingly young and beautiful. Now, the urban area of Moscow, the Soviet capital with a history of more than 800 years, is almost twice as large as it was before the revolution. It has built more houses after the October Revolution than were built in the hundreds of years of the Tsarist era. The face of Leningrad, the cradle of the socialist revolution, is also very different from what it used to be. Now, visitors there can not only see the Smolny Palace, the State Hermitage Museum and other places of interest, but also many high-rise buildings, magnificent cultural palaces and theaters, new streets, squares, parks, and industrial enterprises built after the revolution. Minsk, the capital of the Belorussian Republic, was severely damaged during the Great Patriotic War, but it quickly recovered from the ruins and further developed after the war. It now has three hundred streets lined with tall buildings. In Irkutsk, an ancient Siberian city with a history of more than 300 years, the area of new housing built in the post-war period alone is equal to the total area of housing built in the 260 years before the revolution.

According to statistics up to 1955, due to the development of new and old cities, the number of cities in the Soviet Union with a population of over 100,000 increased from 31 in 1926 to 134, and the number of cities with a population of over 500,000 increased from 3 to 21. In that year, the total urban population of the country increased from 24.7 million before the revolution to 84.6 million, and the total residential area of cities (including urban-type settlements) increased to more than three and a half times that of 1913.

The picture on the right shows the city of Dneprodzerzhinsk, one of the main industrial centers of the Soviet Union, with lush greenery and tall buildings everywhere, both beautiful and prosperous. In fact, the two pictures are of the same place, one taken forty years ago and the other taken now. (Photographed by Suchev, Xinhua News Agency manuscript)

    计划经济大大发展了工业中心
    苏联四十年来建成新城市近千
    新华社莫斯科24日电　随着工业建设的迅速发展，十月革命后的四十年来，苏联地图上已经出现了大约九百个新城市。全国城市的总数已经从1913年的六百六十六个增加到1956年4月的一千五百六十九个，即增加了一倍多。
    在这几十年间，世界上没有任何一个国家的新城市像苏联出现得这么多，这么迅速。甚至苏联地理学家都来不及把最近几年出现的新城市在一般的地图上标划出来。
    苏联的新城市差不多都是从1928年开始的五年计划年代中建设起来的。这些城市分布在苏联的四面八方，其中有许多已经驰名国内外。革命以前俄国最主要的采煤冶金工业中心顿巴斯只有五个城市，而现在已经增加到五十六个。二十五年以前，这里的克拉马托尔斯克还不过是一个小村镇，而现在已经发展成苏联一个重要的重型机器制造工业中心。另一个新城市德鲁日科夫卡是1940年以后从一个村庄发展起来的，它现在出产着占苏联总产量的一半的电气机车和三分之二的煤矿地下运输设备。在著名的工业区乌拉尔，单是在战前几个五年计划中就兴建了三十多个城市。其中最著名的是马格尼托哥尔斯克，到去年年初它已经发展成一个拥有二十八万余人口的大工业中心。在辽远的西伯利亚，在五年计划年代中出现了斯大林斯克、伊加尔卡、诺里尔斯克、安加尔斯克等几十个新城市。斯大林斯克城原是一个小村落，是在兴建库兹?茨克钢铁联合工厂后发展起来的，到去年年初，它的人口已经由原先的三千多人增加到三十四万七千人。伊加尔卡现在是西伯利亚极北地区叶尼塞河畔一个最大的港口、木材工业中心和文化中心，然而在二十七年以前，那里还不过是一片北极熊不时出没的荒野。
    在苏联远东地区，阿穆尔河上的共青团城是远近知名的。然而，这个有十多万人口的现代化工业城的所在地，在二十五年前还是一个荒凉的村落。
    和新城市不断出现的同时，苏联各地的旧城市也在迅速发展并且变得日益年青和美丽。现在，有八百多年历史的苏联首都莫斯科的城区面积几乎比革命前扩大了一倍。它在十月革命后增建的房屋比沙皇时代几百年间修建的房屋的总和还多。社会主义革命的摇篮列宁格勒的面目同往日也大不相同了。现在，到那里游历的人不但可以看到斯莫尔尼宫、国家古物博物馆等名胜古迹，而且还可以看到革命后建筑的许多高楼大厦、宏丽的文化宫和剧院、新的街道、广场、公园和工业企业。白俄罗斯共和国首都明斯克在卫国战争期间曾经受到严重的破坏，但是，战后它很快就从废墟中恢复过来而且进一步发展了。现在它已经有三百条两旁矗立着高大建筑物的街道。在有三百多年历史的西伯利亚古城伊尔库次克，单是在战后时期建筑的新住宅就等于它在革命前二百六十年中所建筑的住宅面积的总和。
    据截至1955年的统计，由于新、旧城市的发展，苏联人口在十万以上的城市从1926年的三十一个增加到一百三十四个，人口在五十万以上的城市从三个增加到二十一个。这一年，全国城市人口总数由革命前的两千四百七十万增加到八千四百六十万，城市（包括城镇型居民区在内）住宅总面积增为1913年的三倍半以上。（附图片）
