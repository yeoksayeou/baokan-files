Leading the Great Debate Must Not Be Done Simply for Speed
Dengta Township Fails Due to Applying Pressure and Randomly Labeling People
Long'an Township Corrects the "Good Enough" Mentality and Continues to Deepen the Airing of Views

This newspaper reports that the great debate must not be rushed, and careful preparation must be done after the conclusion of the airing of views. At the same time, pressure cannot be applied and labels cannot be randomly assigned in the great debate, otherwise the great debate will fail. This is a lesson learned by Dengta Township in Heyuan County, Guangdong Province, in the socialist education and democratic rectification of the commune movement.

Dengta Township launched the socialist education and democratic rectification of the commune movement in early September. Because the cadres' thinking was armed and the masses' concerns were dispelled, the first step of airing views was done relatively well. All 376 households in the township participated in airing views, and the masses put forward a total of 65 opinions on cooperation, farmers' lives, and the party's leadership work.

However, after the airing of views, the township's party branch and work team developed a hasty and quick-win mentality, unwilling to continue the arduous and in-depth preparation work before the great debate. They neither formed a team with party members, league members, and poor peasants as the core, nor did they seriously conduct investigation and research to classify and rank the opinions raised by the masses, determine the debate objects, and collect specific materials around the major issues of right and wrong. They also failed to dispel the concerns of the relatively well-off middle peasants in the township who were afraid of being isolated and labeled as rightists, so that they dared to argue in the great debate. Therefore, when this unprepared battle was fought, there was a phenomenon of "three more and one less" (that is, more big principles were talked about, more labels were given, more cadres spoke, and fewer masses spoke). When the Pingtang production team held its first evening of debate, the township head first announced the list of debate objects and bluntly called on the masses to "struggle" with them to the end. As a result, not only did no one stand up to express opposing views, but even correct opinions were not dared to be raised. Commune member Zhu Hengliu said: "The township head said that they are sabotaging and anti-socialist, so we have no opinions."

This failed great debate in Dengta Township not only failed to distinguish between right and wrong, refute various fallacies, and raise the socialist consciousness of the broad masses of commune members, but on the contrary, it caused ideological confusion among commune members and further increased the dissatisfaction of some upper-middle peasants. The relatively well-off middle peasant Luo Liu'an did not have his ideological problems solved in the debate, but said: "Your criticism of me is very correct, my reactionary thoughts must be struggled against; I am wrong, and I will not dare to say bad things in the future."

Now, the Heyuan County Party Committee and the Dengta District Party Committee have promptly discovered the problems in Dengta Township and are correcting them to put the movement on the right track.

This newspaper reports that since September 17, Long'an Township in Yulin County, Guangxi, has launched an airing of views among the masses. After five evenings of airing views, the cadres saw that more than 80% of the masses attended the meeting, and many questions and opinions were raised. They thought that the airing of views was almost done and planned to end it and move on to the debate. However, after checking the airing of views, they found that 11% of the adult commune members had not attended the meeting, and 21% of those who did had not said a word; more than half of those who attended the meeting did not thoroughly air their views; especially among the 75 upper-middle peasants, 30 had not expressed their opinions, and the remaining 45 only said a little and did not dare to participate in the debate.

The situation revealed cleared the cadres' minds and overcame their simple and quick-win mentality. Therefore, they reorganized their forces and continued to go deeper, uniting and mobilizing the masses to thoroughly air their views. In the process of uniting, they addressed the masses' ideological concerns, ensuring that they would not randomly label people, not refute them on the spot, not pursue them hard, and not restrict them by asking questions. At the same time, for the opinions raised by the masses that belonged to work-related matters, they immediately took measures to improve them if they could be improved immediately. For example, someone pointed out that the accounting office did not open on time, which was very inconvenient for commune members. The commune accepted the suggestion and immediately made improvements. Someone suggested that the commune should strengthen the leadership of sideline production, expand the channels, and increase income. After research, the commune management committee decided to increase the number of sows raised by 35, restore the production of lime kilns, and increase sideline projects such as weaving mats and raising geese, and immediately took action. In this way, the masses saw the role of raising opinions, which encouraged their enthusiasm for airing views.

After the above work, the airing of views in the township was greatly deepened. By September 27, 93% of the adults in the township had participated in airing views, and all 75 upper-middle peasants had expressed their views on various issues and volunteered to take the lead in confronting and distinguishing right from wrong.

### 领导大辩论不能简单图快  灯塔乡施用压力乱扣帽子遭到失败  龙安乡纠正差不多思想继续深入鸣放

    领导大辩论不能简单图快
    灯塔乡施用压力乱扣帽子遭到失败
    龙安乡纠正差不多思想继续深入鸣放
    本报讯　大辩论不能简单图快，在大鸣大放结束之后，必须认真做好准备工作；同时在大辩论中不能施用压力，乱扣帽子，否则大辩论就将遭到失败，这是广东河源县灯塔乡在社会主义教育和民主整社运动中得到的一个教训。
    灯塔乡9月初旬开展了社会主义教育和民主整社运动，由于武装了干部思想和解除了群众的顾虑，第一步的大鸣大放搞得还算好，全乡三百七十六户，全部参加了鸣放，群众对合作化、农民生活和党的领导工作方面共提出了六十五条意见。
    但是，大鸣大放之后，乡里的党支部和工作组却产生了急躁图快的情绪，不愿意继续艰苦深入的做好大辩论前的准备工作。既没有组成以党、团员和贫农为核心的队伍；又没有认真做好调查研究，将群众提的意见分类排队，确定辩论对象，并且围绕大是大非的问题收集具体材料；也没有解除乡内富裕中农怕被孤立、怕扣右派帽子的顾虑，使之在大辩论中敢于进行争辩。因此，这个无准备的仗打起来的时候，便出现“三多一少”（即讲大道理多，扣帽子多，干部讲得多和群众发言少）的现象。坪塘生产队第一晚进行辩论时，首先由乡长公布辩论对象名单，并且生硬地号召群众和他们“斗争”到底。这样不但没有人站出来发表反面的意见，连正确的意见也没有人敢提。社员朱恒六说：“乡长都讲了他们是破坏、是反社会主义了，我们没有意见了。”
    灯塔乡这次失败的大辩论，不但没有分清大是大非，驳倒各种谬论，提高广大社员的社会主义觉悟，相反的，造成社员思想混乱，更增加了某些上中农的不满。富裕中农罗流安在辩论中思想问题没有解决，却说：“你们批评我很对，我的反动思想要斗争；我错了，以后我不敢再讲坏话了。”
    现在，中共河源县委和灯塔区委已及时发现了灯塔乡的问题，正进行纠正，使运动走向正轨。
    本报讯　广西玉林县龙安乡从9月17日起在群众中开展鸣放。在鸣放了五个夜晚以后，干部们看到80％以上的群众到了会，提出的问题和意见也不少了，就认为鸣放得差不多了，打算就此收场，转入辩论。但是，经过检查鸣放情况，发现：成年社员还有11％没有到会，到会的又有21％一言未发；到会的人中有一半以上鸣放得不彻底；特别是七十五户上中农，还有三十户没有发表意见，其余四十五户，都只讲了一点，不敢参加辩论。
    检查出来的情况，清醒了干部的头脑，克服了他们简单图快的思想。于是，重整旗鼓，继续深入下去，串连发动群众彻底鸣放。在串连中，针对群众思想顾虑，做到不乱扣帽子，不当场批驳，不穷追硬逼，不出题限制。与此同时，对于群众已经提出的属于工作方面的意见，能马上改进的，立即采取措施改进。如有人提出会计室不按时间办公使社员很不方便，社里接受意见马上作了改进。有人建议社里要加强副业生产领导，扩大门路，增加收入。社管委会经过研究，决定增养母猪三十五头，恢复石灰窑的生产，增加织席、养鹅等副业项目，并立即行动起来。这样，使群众看到了提意见的作用，鼓舞了他们鸣放的劲头。
    经过上述工作，该乡鸣放就大大深入一步。到9月27日，全乡93％的成年人参加了鸣放，七十五户上中农，全部讲出了他们对各项问题的看法，并自愿挂帅交锋，辨清是非。
