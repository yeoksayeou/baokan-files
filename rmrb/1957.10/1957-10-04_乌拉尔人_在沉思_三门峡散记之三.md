    "The Ural Man" in Contemplation
    ——Random Notes on Sanmenxia, Part Three
    Lei Jia
    "The Ural Man" (the workers' affectionate name for the three-cubic-meter electric shovel), arrived at Huixing Station in winter, but did not immediately come to the Sanmenxia construction site.

    Many people rushed to Huixing Station to see it. At that time, it was asleep. When it was asleep, no one could wake it up. When it left the Urals, it was nailed into wooden crates; upon arriving at Huixing, the wooden crates were covered with tarpaulins. Now it sleeps along the railway tracks, stretched out for almost half a li.

    The engineers recognized it at a glance. They extended their warmest greetings to it, and at the same time discussed how to welcome it to the construction site. The welcoming ceremony had to be both respectful and safe. For some others, it was like meeting their grandfather for the first time, they only knew it was "The Ural Man," its appearance was unfamiliar; but the impression was extremely profound, immediately realizing that this was a huge man, with a huge heart. They whispered to each other: "This is its big mouth, four people can sit inside and play poker!" "Look, this is its heart..." Its heart – a noble electric motor, like a small mountain. A heart so large that it could encompass everything. It made people think that it would walk proudly on Sanmen Island, and the workers would grab its lapels, and snort at those majestic rocks, saying: "Look who's here! Dare you not bow your head?"

    But it didn't come right away. I knew that the bureau's warehouse had prepared a vehicle to welcome it, a twenty-five-ton trailer. There were two highways, both newly built. One was flatter and longer; the other was shorter and steeper. There seemed to have been a debate about which highway to take. The main "Zheng-Luo-San" line was not yet completed, the power generation train had not yet arrived, and it had a habit of not getting up without an electric massage.

    The three Fushun-made one-cubic-meter electric shovels on the construction site were making a big fuss. At that time, using hand-held pneumatic drills to make holes, no matter how little the rock was blasted each day, the one-cubic-meter electric shovel still couldn't complete the task. They broke down one after another, complaining: "Why isn't the three-cubic-meter one coming? What are we supposed to do?"

    In April, everything was ready. The railway crane came, and the Stalin No. 80 tractor, to avoid damaging the road surface, had wood planks embedded in its track teeth. "The Ural Man's" bucket and dipper stick were first transported to the Shijiatan ferry, and then the railway was opened ahead of schedule, and its chassis was also transported. Now, it was a matter of how to organize the crossing of the Yellow River.

    Although "The Ural Man" had traveled many places, this was its first time coming to the Yellow River. For days, it lay on the banks of the Yellow River, listening to its roar day and night. It thought: Why is this small muddy ditch making such a loud noise? If "The Ural Man" stood up, it could cross it in three or two steps. The Yellow River refused to show weakness, and replied to it: "I know your abilities are very remarkable, but there is a Chinese saying: 'No discord, no concord!'" The Yellow River played a small joke on "The Ural Man." The Yellow River suddenly冲 rushed the large barge carrying the chassis to the upper reaches of Shenmen Island. The large anchor was dropped, the chain broke, and the large barge floated downstream like an autumn leaf. Some people said: if it had leaned a little more to the left, it would have overturned two exploration boats, and then crashed into Shenmen Island, until it was smashed to pieces. But it did not lean to the left, but slightly to the right, and the large barge, in a big spin on the upper reaches of Shenmen Island, rested its butt on a reef.

    The chassis and the barge were stranded on this reef for a full five days. All the Sanmenxia water conservancy workers protested to the Yellow River: "Your joke is too big! It's here to help you transform, why are you being so vicious? The chassis is 'The Ural Man's' spine, without the spine, it can't even stand up!"

    Using three hundred people to pull the tow ropes, plus three tractors, the chassis and barge were dragged back to the original ferry crossing after five days.

    "The Ural Man" was born with a generous heart and liked to contemplate.

    It did not hold the Yellow River's joke in its heart; on the contrary, just as the Chinese saying goes, "No discord, no concord," it felt that being able to work on the Yellow River in China was the most meaningful thing.

    It was already accustomed to extremely enthusiastic but inconsiderate hospitality. It was the same here.

    None of this could make it angry. Because it was a contemplative person.

    Its volume was too large, and the left bank was too narrow. As soon as it stood up, its head almost touched the high-voltage wires. It endured this.

    The installation technicians invited from Fushun, although their hands were as skillful as the people who made it; there were too many inconvenient things. For example, the parts were not transported in order, and it was impossible to start work for a while; a gin pole was used instead of a crane; and mismatched steel cables made it tremble. It encountered these things that slighted it everywhere. Just the bucket alone, which was originally prepared to be driven to the working face and installed using its own power; but the coordination was poor, the crane operator didn't come, the steel cables couldn't be threaded, and it was delayed for a day. And once, the welding machine was moved from a very far place, but it was forgotten to bring the engine oil, so the construction period had to be extended for another day.

    It itself was a complex machine, and at this time, it was surprised to observe the even more complex people.

    While there were people who slighted it, there were also people who loved it. These people ran to the construction site every day to see it. They spread news about it. Photography reporters took countless shots of it. In the letters sent from Sanmenxia, its touching image was described countless times. Young technicians quietly put away the book "Electric Shovel" (about the one-cubic-meter electric shovel), and rushed to bookstores to snap up СЭ—3 type teaching diagrams. Everyone imagined in their minds that once it was put into production, it would bring a new atmosphere. The most skilled engineers could draft a completely new joint operation plan; but the most experienced leaders could not fully estimate the ideological storm it would bring and the inevitable large-scale personnel transfer.

    In a mechanized construction site, you have to race against the speed of machinery. The one who runs ahead of the speed of machinery is the victor. There were many people here who had raced with bucket cars, and also raced with one-cubic-meter electric shovels, and now they knew they had to race with "The Ural Man."

    When they raced with the one-cubic-meter electric shovel, it was after a struggle to use the vehicle-mounted drill to coordinate with the hand-held pneumatic drill. Naturally, some people fell behind. The people who fell behind did not dislike the vehicle-mounted drill, but felt that the vehicle-mounted drill was not as easy to use as the hand-held pneumatic drill, just like people who like to ride bicycles, do not dislike motorcycles, but feel that motorcycles are a bit risky. In order to oppose a new thing, a ridiculous reason would sometimes be fabricated. They said: "No matter how slow a bicycle is, you can carry it when it breaks down, can you carry a motorcycle too?"

    "The Ural Man" was destined to have such a fate: it was enthusiastically created by workers, but it had to be ridiculed and played with by other workers.

    The situation where the blasting capacity was greater than the one-cubic-meter electric shovel suddenly disappeared. The one-cubic-meter electric shovel could only fill a truck in five or six times, but "The Ural Man" could fill a truck in at most one or two scoops with its big mouth. For the bucket car, "The Ural Man" was no longer a motorcycle, but an airplane.

    Now it was necessary to use a 100-type drilling machine. A laggard, not admitting the advantages of the drilling machine, opposed it, the reason being: the drilling machine is difficult to move, how can it be said to be better than the hand-held pneumatic drill? When the drilling machine exerted its power, and "The Ural Man" nodded in praise, this laggard, with a sad heart, went to "The Ural Man" and quietly asked: "You were made by workers, why do you use workers as slaves?" "The Ural Man," as usual, replied thoughtfully: "Time is our master, now we are standing on the same line, once the gun fires, whoever wants to be the victor, don't talk, hold your breath, and run forward quickly!"

    Wherever "The Ural Man" goes, it must not only conquer the rocks, but also first conquer the hearts of the people.

    Now the second "Ural Man" has also been installed. I attended the handover meeting. The evaluation report stated: everything is good. Only the large herringbone gear mesh is slightly poor, and there is some oil leakage in the gearbox.

    I also attended the discussion meeting on the production tasks of the third team in August. They were familiar with the characteristics of "The Ural Man" working outdoors, and could not but estimate the coming rainy season. But they still had the confidence to complete the task. They already called these two "Ural Men" their lifelines, and vowed to cherish them as if they were their eyeballs. For this reason, during the discussion, someone worriedly asked: "How is the blasting plan of the second team drawn up? 'The Ural Man' has to go down first, and then come up again, connect two cable heads, three switches, which will take at least two days..." The person's expression seemed to say: with such a delay of two days, "The Ural Man" would never agree. Then the person said: "Besides, there is no road, where will it go down from?"

    When "The Ural Man" acts, it must first open the road, and once it acts, stones larger than bowls will be crushed until sparks fly. For the "Ural Man" who is good at contemplation, it is not okay to act rashly.

    However, now it is the flood season, and the weather has been exceptionally clear for these ten days. If it does not go down first to grab the stone roots, the next blasting project will not be able to be implemented. In order to create favorable conditions for the last ten days of the month, in order to race against the weather and race against the floods, it was decided that "The Ural Man" must go down first...

    "The Ural Man" not only contemplates, but also smiles. The third team's cooperative decision made it smile, nodding its huge head.

    “乌拉尔人”在沉思
    ——三门峡散记之三
    雷加
    “乌拉尔人”（工人对三方电铲的亲昵的称呼），冬天来到了会兴车站，却没有立刻到三门峡工地上来。
    很多人赶到会兴车站去看望它。那时，它在沉睡。它沉睡的时候，没有人能够惊醒它。由乌拉尔起身的时候，给它钉好了木箱；到了会兴，又在木箱外面苫上了篷布。现在它睡在铁路两旁，摆开来几乎有半里长。
    工程师们，一眼就认出了它。他们向它致最亲切的问候，同时商议着如何迎接它到工地上来。迎接的仪式，既要不失礼节，又要安全。它对另外一些人来说，就像初次见面的外祖父一样，只知道它就是“乌拉尔人”，面貌陌生；但是印象极为深刻，立刻意识到这是一个巨大的人，还有一颗巨大的心。切切私语起来：“这是它的大嘴，四个人坐在里面可以打朴克呢！”“你看，这是它的心脏……”它的心脏——一个高贵的电动机，像个小山一样。心脏之大，可以包容一切。使人想到它将在三门岛上昂首阔步地走着，工人们就要揪住它的衣襟，对那些威严的岩石，哼着鼻子说道：“你瞧谁来啦！你还敢不低头吗？”
    但是它并没有马上就来。我知道总局仓库里准备着迎接它的车子，那是一辆载重二十五吨的拖车。公路有两条，都是新修起来的。一条平坦些，远些；另一条近些，坡度大些。为了走哪条公路，似乎有过争论。主要的“郑洛三”线路没有建成，发电列车还没有来，而它偏偏有个不通过电流的按摩就不肯起床的习惯。
    工地上三台抚顺造的一方电铲，正在大闹情绪。当时用手风钻打眼，每天爆破的石方再少，一方电铲仍然完不成任务。它们一台跟一台坏起来，抱怨道：“三方怎么不来呢？叫我们怎么办呢？”
    4月间，一切都齐备了。铁路吊车来了，斯大林八十号拖拉机为了怕压坏路面，在履带齿上也镶上了木板，“乌拉尔人”的斗子、勺杆先运到了史家滩渡口，接着铁路提前通车了，它的底盘也运来了。现在，就看怎样组织过黄河了。
    “乌拉尔人”虽然走过许多地方，来到黄河却是第一次。那几天它躺在黄河边上，日日夜夜听着黄河的咆哮声。它想：这条小小的泥沟，为什么叫得这么响呢？它，“乌拉尔人”如果站起来，三步两步就会跨过去的。黄河决不肯示弱，回答它说：“我知道你的本事是很了不起的，可是中国有句俗话：不打不相识呵！”黄河对“乌拉尔人”开了一个小小的玩笑。黄河把载着底盘的大驳船，一下子冲到神门岛上边。大锚丢下去，链子断了，这只大驳船像一片秋叶似的，顺流而下。有人说：如果再靠左一点，它就会撞翻两只勘探船，然后撞到神门岛上，一直到撞得粉碎为止。但是没有靠左，而是偏右了一点，这只大驳船在神门岛上边，一个大旋身，屁股垫在一块礁石上搁住了。
    连底盘带驳船在这块礁石上，整整搁了五天。所有三门峡的水利工人，向黄河提出了抗议：“你的玩笑开得太大啦！它来帮助你改造的，你下这番毒手，却是为了什么？底盘是‘乌拉尔人’的脊椎骨，没有脊椎骨它连站也站不起来啦！”
    用三百个人工拉纤，外加上三部拖拉机，五天之后又把底盘带驳船，拖到原来的渡口上了。
    “乌拉尔人”生来心怀宽大，而且喜欢沉思。
    黄河开的这个玩笑，它并未记在心里；相反的，正如中国俗话说的不打不相识，它觉得自己能到中国黄河来工作，是最有意义的了。
    它早已习惯了极热情却又不周到的招待。这里也是一样。
    这一切，都不能使它生气。因为它是一个沉思的人。
    它的体积过大，左岸又太狭窄。它刚刚站起来，头上就几乎碰着了高压线。这一点，它忍受了。
    由抚顺请来的安装技工，手固然灵巧得不下于制造它的人；但不凑手的事情太多。比如机件没有按着次序运来，一时不能开始工作；拔杆代替了吊车；不相称的钢丝绳又使它发抖。它到处碰到了这些怠慢它的事情。只是斗子这一项，本来预备开到工作面利用本身动力安装的；但是协作得不好，起重工不来，不能穿钢丝绳，就耽搁了一天。还有一次，电焊机从很远的地方搬来了，忘记了带机油，因此工期又得延长一天。
    它本身是一架复杂的机器，这时，它惊奇地观察着更为复杂的人。
    既有怠慢它的人，同时又出现了热爱它的人。这些人天天跑到工地上来看望它。他们传说着关于它的消息。摄影记者不知为它留下了多少镜头。由三门峡发出的信件中，又不知描述过多少次它的感人的形象。年青的技术员们，把“电铲”这本书（关于一方电铲的）悄悄收起来，到书店抢购СЭ—3型教学图。谁都在脑子里想像着，当它一旦投入生产之后，必会带来一番新气象。最熟练的工程师们，可以草拟一个完全新的联合作业的作业计划；但是最有经验的领导者，却一时不能完全估计到它带来的思想上的大风暴和必然而来的人员大调动。
    在机械化施工的场地上，就得和机械的速度赛跑。跑在机械速度前面的，才是胜利者。这里有不少人和斗子车赛跑过，又和一方电铲赛跑过，现在他们知道必须和“乌拉尔人”赛跑了。
    他们和一方电铲赛跑时，为了配合手风钻使用车钻，是经过一番斗争的。自然有一些人落伍了。落伍的人并不是不欣赏车钻，只是觉得车钻没有手风钻顺手，就像喜欢骑自行车的人，也并不是不欣赏机器脚踏车，只是觉得机器脚踏车冒险了一点。为了反对一个新事物，有时会捏造出一个可笑的理由的。他们说：“自行车再慢，坏了还可以扛起来，难道机器脚踏车也能够扛着走吗？”
    “乌拉尔人”注定了有这样一个命运：它被工人热情地创造出来，又不得不受其他工人的嘲笑和玩弄。
    曾经出现的爆破能力大于一方电铲的情况，一下子消失了。一方电铲五六次才能装一汽车，“乌拉尔人”用它的大嘴，最多吞吐两次就能装满一汽车。“乌拉尔人”对于斗子车来说，不再是机器脚踏车，而是飞机了。
    现在必须使用一百型的钻机。一个落伍者，不承认钻机的优点，反对的理由是：钻机移动困难，怎能说它比手风钻好？当钻机发挥了威力，“乌拉尔人”称许地点头时，这个落伍者带着一颗悲哀的心，走到“乌拉尔人”跟前，悄悄问道：“你是工人制造出来的，为什么又把工人当做奴隶来使用？”“乌拉尔人”照例沉思地答：“时间才是我们的主人，现在咱们站在一条线上，枪一响，谁要做胜利者，就别说话，憋口气，赶快朝前跑吧！”
    “乌拉尔人”所到的地方，不但要征服岩石，还要首先征服人心。
    现在第二台“乌拉尔人”也安装起来了。我参加了交接会。在鉴定书上写着：一切良好。只是大人字轮咬合稍差，还有变速箱有些漏油。
    我又参加了三队8月份生产任务讨论会。他们熟习了“乌拉尔人”在露天工作的特点，不能不估计要来的雨期。但是他们仍有信心完成任务。他们已经称呼这两个“乌拉尔人”是他们的命根子，并且誓言爱护它要像爱护眼珠一样。为了这个，在讨论当中有人耽心地问：“二队的爆破方案是怎样订的？要‘乌拉尔人’先下去，然后又得上来，接两个电缆头，三个开关，至少得耽误两天……”这个人说话的神气好像说：这样延误两天，“乌拉尔人”决不会答应的。接着这人又说：“再说，没有路，它由哪里下去呢？”
    “乌拉尔人”行动起来，必须先开路，而且它一行动起来，比碗大的石块也会压得直冒火星。对于善于沉思的“乌拉尔人”，草率行事是不行的。
    但是，现在已是汛期，这十几天天气又分外晴朗，如果它不先下去抢出石根来，下期爆破工程就无法实施。为了给下旬创造有利条件，为了和天气赛跑，和洪水赛跑，还是决定了“乌拉尔人”必得先下去……
    “乌拉尔人”不但会沉思，也会微笑。三队富于协作精神的决定，使它点着巨大的头微笑了。
