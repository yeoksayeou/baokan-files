Xinhua News Agency, 5th: It is estimated that the total amount of consumer goods the people of the whole country will receive from light industry this year will increase by more than 79% compared to 1952; among them, textiles will increase by 33%, food will double, and daily necessities will increase by 81%.

During the period of the First Five-Year Plan, the light industrial production departments across the country supplied the people with a considerable amount of consumer goods. In the first four and a half years of the Five-Year Plan, the national average per capita share among the nation's 600 million plus population was 116 chi of cotton cloth, 11 jin of sugar, 16 jin of cooking oil, 84 jin of salt, 9 jin of machine-made paper, an average of two pairs of rubber shoes for every three people, one gold nib fountain pen for every three people, and one bicycle for every 400 people.

This level has greatly exceeded the highest level in old China's history. 1936 was the year with the highest level of light industrial production in our country before the war. At that time, the national population was only over 470 million. In that year, the average per capita share from light industry was only 22 chi of cotton cloth, which was 4 chi less per person per year than the average in the first four and a half years of the Five-Year Plan, and 1.8 jin of sugar, which was 0.6 jin less per person per year than the average in the first four and a half years of the Five-Year Plan. At that time, a large number of light industrial products needed to be imported from foreign countries, and the prices were expensive, making it difficult for the broad masses of working people to enjoy them. Now, due to the increase in domestic light industrial products and the increase in people's purchasing power, the amount of cloth sold to rural areas last year alone exceeded 10 billion chi, with an average consumption of 24 chi per person; 36.39 million pairs of rubber shoes were sold to rural areas; salt sold to rural areas increased by 59% compared to 1949, and sugar increased fivefold compared to 1949. Before liberation, many peasant families had only one quilt, and some families even had only one pair of trousers for several people. This situation is now gone forever.

In order to meet the material and cultural needs of the people, China's light industry departments have also successfully trial-produced thousands of new products and made many improvements in designs and varieties during the Five-Year Plan. The textile industry alone has successfully trial-produced more than 1,000 new products in five years. In addition to various cotton cloths, satins, and woolens, there are also very beautiful knitwear, headscarves, and handkerchiefs. Now, Shanghai alone produces more than 2,000 kinds of printed fabrics, and many floral fabric patterns, such as "Red Peony," "Spring Flowers All Over the Ground," and "Small Roses," are carefully designed by designers. The staff and workers of the printing and dyeing factories have also improved the printing and dyeing technology, making the colors of the fabrics more vivid and beautiful, and the fastness of the printing and dyeing has also been improved. All light-colored floral fabrics have achieved complete non-fading.

There are even more varieties of daily necessities and food that have been added. There are vegetable and fruit canned goods specially made for field exploration personnel. Farmers reflected that the thermos bottles produced in the past were not suitable for fieldwork, did not hold much water, and were easy to fall over, so factories in Shanghai trial-produced a short, fat-type thermos bottle that holds eight pounds, which is very popular among farmers. Various ethnic minorities have also obtained many special daily necessities from light industry. Such as Soviet-style enamel stew pots and duckbill kettles used by the Uighur people in Xinjiang, milk buckets, Mongolian bowls, and Longhua washbasins used by the Mongolian people, as well as various ethnic costumes, hats, and boots. Tianjin also trial-produced Tibetan raincoats suitable for horseback riding and halal toothpaste specially for Hui people.

In recent years, light industry departments have also produced many high-end consumer goods. In the past, our country could only repair watches, but now Shanghai and Tianjin have successfully trial-produced them. Pianos, radios, etc. can now also be produced independently.

In the past few years, China's light industry has developed on a considerable scale. From 1953 to now, there have been 52 newly built and expanded sugar factories, paper mills, and textile mills above the quota that have been put into production in whole or in part; plus construction units below the quota, the newly added production capacity is: 436,000 tons of sugar, 154,000 tons of paper, and 1.67 million spindles. The staff and workers of the light industry department have made great efforts in production and overcome many difficulties. Comparing the first half of this year with 1952, the amount of cotton used to spin one piece of yarn was reduced by 5.52 kilograms, the amount of pulp used per ton of paper was reduced by 61 kilograms, and the oil yield of soybeans was increased by 1.77%. Because the consumption of raw materials has been reduced, the consumer goods produced through savings in the past five years have also accounted for a considerable amount.

### 轻工业产品与日俱增  四年来，全国平均每人得到棉布一百一十六尺，食糖十一斤；每三人两双胶鞋、一支金笔钢笔；每四百人一辆自行车。

    轻工业产品与日俱增
    四年来，全国平均每人得到棉布一百一十六尺，食糖十一斤；每三人两双胶鞋、一支金笔钢笔；每四百人一辆自行车。
    据新华社5日讯　今年全国人民从轻工业方面得到的消费资料总量，预计可以比1952年增加79％以上；其中纺织品增加33％，食品增加一倍，日用品增加81％。
    在第一个五年计划期间，全国轻工业生产部门供给人民的消费资料是相当可观的。五年计划的前四年半，全国六亿多人口平均每人得到的棉布是一百一十六尺，食糖十一斤，食油十六斤，盐八十四斤，机制纸九斤，胶鞋平均每三人两双，金笔钢笔每三人一支，自行车每四百人一辆。
    这个水平已经大大超过旧中国历史上的最高水平。1936年是我国战前轻工业生产水平最高的一年，那时全国人口只四亿七千多万，那一年平均每人从轻工业方面得到的棉布只二十二尺，比五年计划前四年半平均每人每年少四尺，食糖一点八斤，比五年计划前四年半平均每人每年少零点六斤。当时，大量的轻工业品需要从国外进口，而且价格昂贵，广大劳动人民很难享受得到。现在由于国产轻工业品增加、人民购买力提高等原因，去年只是销到农村去的布匹就有一百亿尺以上，平均每人消费二十四尺；销到农村的胶鞋是三千六百三十九万双；销到农村的食盐比1949年增加59％，食糖比1949年增加五倍。解放以前许多农民全家只有一条被子，有的甚至一家几口只有一条裤子。这种状况，现在已经一去不复返了。
    我国轻工业部门为满足人民物质文化生活需要，在五年计划期间还试制成功了成千上万种新产品，花色品种也有很多改进。单是纺织工业在五年内就试制成功了一千多种新产品。除了各种棉布、绸缎、呢绒以外，还有非常漂亮的针织品、花头巾、手帕等。现在，只是上海生产的印花布就有两千多种，像“红牡丹”、“春花满地”、“小玫瑰”等许多花布图案，都是经过设计师精心设计的。印染厂的职工还改进了印染技术，使布的花色更加鲜艳美观，印染的坚牢度也提高了。一般浅色花布已经做到全部不褪色。
    在日用品和食品方面增加的品种更多。有专门为野外勘探人员制造的蔬菜、水果罐头。农民反映过去生产的热水瓶在田间干活时不适用，装水不多，又容易跌倒，上海的工厂就试制了一种八磅的矮胖型热水瓶，深受农民欢迎。各少数民族也从轻工业方面得到了许多特殊的生活用品。如新疆维吾尔族人民用的苏式搪瓷焖锅、鸭嘴壶，蒙古族人民用的牛奶桶、蒙古碗、龙花面盆，以及各种民族服装、帽子、靴子等。天津还试制了适于骑马用的藏式雨衣，和专供回民用的清真牙膏等。
    近年来轻工业部门还生产出了许多高级消费品。过去我国只能修配的手表，现在上海和天津都已经试制成功。钢琴、收音机等现在也都能独立生产。
    这几年来，我国轻工业有了相当规模的发展。从1953年到现在，已经全部或部分投入生产的限额以上的新建、扩建的糖厂、纸厂和纺织厂就有五十二个；加上限额以下的建设单位，新增加的生产能力是：糖四十三万六千吨，纸十五万四千吨，纱锭一百六十七万枚。轻工业部门的职工在生产中做了很大的努力，克服了很多困难。今年上半年和1952年比较，每纺一件纱用棉量减少了五点五二公斤，每吨纸用浆量减少了六十一公斤，大豆出油率提高了1.77％。因为原料消耗量减少，五年来依靠节约而增产的消费品也占了相当数量。
