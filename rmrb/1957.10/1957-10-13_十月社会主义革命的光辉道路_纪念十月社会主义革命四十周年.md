　　The Glorious Road of the October Socialist Revolution
　　—Commemorating the 40th Anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution
　　Chairman of the China Association for Promoting Democracy Ma Xulun

　　The 40th anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution is approaching, and the people of our country are warmly welcoming it with unparalleled joy and excitement.

　　The great October Socialist Revolution opened a new era in human history, marking a fundamental change in the destiny of mankind. It was the first to completely eliminate the corrupt capitalist system of exploitation and oppression of man by man in one-sixth of the world's land, and established a new socialist society without classes, exploitation, and oppression. This unprecedented new situation fundamentally shattered the lie that the capitalist system would "last forever," and pointed out the only correct path to complete liberation for all oppressed and exploited classes and nations. This world-shaking event will inevitably lead to the collapse of the capitalist and imperialist systems throughout the world, and the victory of the socialist and communist systems throughout the world. This is determined by the objective laws of social and historical development and cannot be shifted by anyone's subjective wishes.

　　The great October Socialist Revolution has already achieved such great achievements. It liberated the Soviet people and made them the masters of their own country for the first time. With unprecedented courage, they overcame enormous difficulties, defeated imperialist armed intervention, quelled domestic counter-revolutionary rebellions, and built a peaceful, independent, free, and happy new socialist life, and are advancing towards the most ideal communist society for mankind. The Soviet Union's economy and culture are developing at a speed that is incomparable to capitalist countries. The achievements of the past forty years far exceed those of some old-牌 capitalist countries - the achievements of one hundred and several decades, and in many aspects have caught up with or surpassed the world's most developed capitalist country - the United States. Before the October Revolution, Russia was an industrially backward and largely illiterate country, but now it has become the second largest industrial power in the world, possessing the world's most advanced scientific and technological forces and a highly developed socialist culture. The Soviet Union's Sixth Five-Year Plan and subsequent plans will catch up with and surpass the United States in terms of per capita commodity production in the shortest possible time. The Soviet Union has long eliminated unemployment, the material welfare of the people has been fundamentally improved, the prices of daily necessities have been continuously reduced, and the actual income of workers and peasants has continued to increase and their living standards have continued to improve, forming a sharp contrast with the continuous increase in unemployment and poverty, the continuous increase in taxes and prices, and the continuous decrease in the income and living standards of working people in capitalist countries.

　　The Soviet Union is a multi-ethnic country. The great victory of the October Socialist Revolution liberated all ethnic groups from social oppression and national oppression for generations, united them into a unified fraternal family, and created a powerful Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.

　　No matter how the imperialists and bourgeois bureaucratic politicians wantonly slander and defame the great Soviet Union, the iron facts cannot be changed. Since its birth, the Soviet Union has been a defender of peace. The first decree promulgated by the Soviets after the victory of the October Revolution was the Decree on Peace. What the Communist Party of the Soviet Union cares most about is ensuring the peaceful labor of the Soviet people and opposing wars of aggression. The vital interests of the Soviet people and all peace-loving countries and peoples in the world are completely consistent. The powerful economic and military strength established by the Soviet Union after the October Revolution is a reliable pillar for opposing the imperialist policy of aggressive war and defending world peace. During World War II, the Soviet people and the Soviet army not only defended the independence and freedom of their motherland, but also saved the people of Europe and Asia, saving them from the threat of fascist enslavement. It was precisely as a result of the victory over fascism that many countries in Europe and Asia broke away from the capitalist world system and, together with the Soviet Union, formed a powerful socialist camp, thereby providing greater guarantees for world peace. After World War II, the Soviet Union strongly advocated disarmament, the prohibition of the use of atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction, strongly advocated that countries with different social systems can coexist peacefully, and resolutely opposed the imperialist conspiracy to create international tension and launch new wars, making brilliant contributions to defending world peace. In last year's war against imperialist aggression against Egypt, in the event of counter-revolutionary restoration in Hungary, and in the struggle of the people of the Middle Eastern countries against US imperialist aggression, the Soviet Union's efforts played a huge role in defending the socialist cause and maintaining world peace.

　　The great victory of the October Socialist Revolution proved that Marxism-Leninism is a universal truth that applies everywhere. After the victory of the October Revolution, the proletariat, under the leadership of the Communist Party, based on the alliance of workers and peasants, united the broad masses of the people, and established the dictatorship of the proletariat over the landlords and the bourgeoisie in order to suppress the resistance of counter-revolutionaries. Without the victory of the October Revolution, without overthrowing the power of the landlords and capitalists, without a consolidated alliance of workers and peasants, and without the friendly unity of all ethnic groups under the principle of internationalism, it would have been completely impossible to successfully complete socialist industrialization and agricultural collectivization, thereby eliminating the system of exploitation, eliminating classes, building a socialist society, and transitioning towards communism.

　　The rich experience of the Soviet people in revolution and construction is an invaluable contribution to the people of our country and the world, and it is a glorious example for us to learn from. The existence of the Soviet Union and its support and assistance to the revolutions of various countries are indispensable factors for the victory of revolutions in various countries. The people of our country have always believed that our revolution is a direct continuation of the October Socialist Revolution. We cherish and appreciate the just support and selfless and enormous assistance that the Soviet people, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and the Soviet government have consistently given us over the years. Our great leader Chairman Mao Zedong once pointed out in his article "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship": "It was through the Russians that the Chinese found Marxism. Before the October Revolution, the Chinese knew neither Lenin nor Stalin, nor Marx nor Engels. The salvo of the October Revolution brought us Marxism-Leninism." It was because Marxism-Leninism was introduced into China and combined with the Chinese workers' movement that the Communist Party of China was conceived and born. The Communist Party of China was established entirely in accordance with Lenin's principles of party building and with the Communist Party of the Soviet Union as an example. Only under the leadership of the Communist Party of China did the Chinese revolution take on a new look and embark on the road to victory. Without the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union, the people of our country would not only have been unable to achieve the great victory of today's socialist revolution and the glorious achievements of socialist construction, but would also have been unable to achieve the complete victory of the bourgeois democratic revolution in 1949. This has long been proven by the history of China's anti-imperialist and anti-feudal struggles over the past century. When we drink water, we think of its source, how can we not be even more grateful to the great Soviet people, the great Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and commemorate the achievements of the great October Socialist Revolution?

　　Facts have proven that although our country's revolution and construction have their own characteristics and the specific development process is not exactly the same as that of the Soviet Union, the basic path and basic experience of the October Socialist Revolution are universal truths of Marxism-Leninism that apply everywhere and are completely suitable for our country. Defending the glorious road of the October Revolution is of extremely great significance in the past and at present. Especially after the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, all kinds of revisionists in the international arena took the opportunity to raise their heads, using the excuse of opposing the cult of personality to oppose Marxism-Leninism and oppose the basic path and basic experience of the October Revolution, thereby completely negating the achievements of the Soviet Union's revolution and construction over the years. This evil trend in the communist movement echoed the imperialist anti-Soviet and anti-communist frenzy, creating a countercurrent in the international arena. After the event of counter-revolutionary restoration in Hungary, the bourgeois rightists in our country thought that there was an opportunity to take advantage of, and used this year's rectification movement of the Communist Party of China to fan the flames and responded from all sides, openly launching a frenzied attack against the Communist Party, against the people, and against socialism. They focused on opposing the leadership of the Communist Party of China and opposing our country's socialist system, which in essence is also opposing our taking the road of the October Socialist Revolution, and vainly attempting to drag our country back to the miserable road of a colony and semi-colony. This is absolutely not allowed by the people of all China. The Chinese people cannot but unite as one, raise their arms and rise up, and give the rightists a head-on blow. The Chinese people's struggle against the bourgeois rightists has already achieved decisive victories in all aspects, and is now moving towards a comprehensive expansion and thorough deepening. We fully believe that the people of our country will surely achieve the final victory in this great movement of socialist revolution in politics and ideology. The people of our country will always unswervingly advance victoriously along the glorious road of the October Socialist Revolution!

　　十月社会主义革命的光辉道路
　　——纪念十月社会主义革命四十周年
    中国民主促进会主席　马叙伦
    伟大的十月社会主义革命的四十周年即将到来，我国人民以无比欢乐和兴奋的心情热烈地迎接它。
    伟大的十月社会主义革命，开辟了人类历史上的新纪元，标志着人类命运的根本改变。它首先在世界六分之一的土地上彻底消灭了人剥削人、人压迫人的腐朽的资本主义制度，建立起新的没有阶级、没有剥削和压迫的社会主义社会。这个史无前例的新局面，从根地粉碎了资本主义制度“万古长存”的谎言，为一切被压迫被剥削的阶级和民族指出了唯一正确的彻底解放的道路。这个震撼世界的大事件不可避免地将导致资本主义、帝国主义制度在全世界崩溃，而社会主义、共产主义制度在全世界胜利。这是客观的社会历史发展规律所决定的，不是谁的主观愿望所能转移的。
    伟大的十月社会主义革命已经获得了如此巨大的成就，它解放了苏联人民，使他们破天荒地成为自己国家的主人，他们以前所未有的魄力克服了巨大的困难，打败了帝国主义的武装干涉，戡平了国内反革命的叛乱，建设起和平、独立、自由、幸福的社会主义新生活，正向着人类最理想的共产主义社会前进。苏联的经济、文化以资本主义国家所不能比拟的速度向前发展着，四十年来的成就远远超过某些老牌资本主义国家——一百几十年的成就，并且在许多方面已经赶上或者超过了世界最发达的资本主义国家——美国。十月革命以前的俄国，是工业落后、文盲众多的国家，现在已经成为世界上第二个工业强国，拥有世界上最先进的科学技术力量和高度发展的社会主义文化。苏联的第六个五年计划和以后的计划，将在尽可能迅速的时间内，在按人口平均计算的商品生产方面赶上和超过美国。苏联早已消灭了失业，人民的物质福利有了根本改善，日用品价格不断降低，工人农民的实际收入不断增加和生活水平不断提高，同在资本主义国家失业和贫困不断增加，赋税和物价不断提高，劳动人民的收入和生活水平不断降低，形成了鲜明的对照。
    苏联是一个多民族的国家，十月社会主义革命的伟大胜利，把各族人民从世世代代的社会压迫和民族压迫下解放出来，团结成为一个统一的兄弟般的大家庭，创造了一个强大的苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟。
    不论帝国主义和资产阶级的官僚政客们怎样对伟大的苏联肆意进行污蔑和诽谤，但是铁的事实是不能改变的。苏联从诞生以来就是和平的保卫者。十月革命胜利之后，苏维埃所公布的第一个法令就是和平法令。苏联共产党所最关心的就是保证苏联人民的和平劳动，反对侵略战争。苏联人民和全世界一切爱好和平的国家和人民的切身利益是完全一致的。苏联在十月革命以后所建立起来的强大经济力量和军事力量，是反对帝国主义侵略战争政策和保卫世界和平的可靠支柱。在第二次世界大战期间，苏联人民和苏联军队不仅捍卫了自己祖国的独立自由，而且拯救了欧洲和亚洲的人民，使他们免于法西斯奴役的威胁。正是由于战胜法西斯的结果，在欧亚两洲许多国家从资本主义世界体系中分裂出来，同苏联一起，形成强大的社会主义阵营，从而使世界和平得到了更大的保障。在第二次世界大战以后，苏联极力主张裁减军备，禁止使用原子武器、氢武器以及其他大规模毁灭性的武器，极力主张不同的社会制度国家可以和平共处，坚决反对帝国主义制造国际紧张局势和发动新战争的阴谋，对于保卫世界和平作出了辉煌的贡献。在去年反对帝国主义侵略埃及的战争中，在反对匈牙利反革命复辟事件中，以及在中东各国人民反对美帝国主义侵略的斗争中，苏联的努力对于保卫社会主义事业、对于维护世界和平都起了巨大的作用。
    十月社会主义革命的伟大胜利，证明了马克思列宁主义是放之四海而皆准的普遍真理。十月革命胜利之后，无产阶级在共产党的领导之下，以工农联盟为基础，联合广大的人民群众，建立了无产阶级对于地主、资产阶级的专政，以镇压反革命分子的反抗。如果没有十月革命的胜利，没有推翻地主、资本家的政权，没有巩固的工农联盟和在国际主义原则下的各族人民的友好团结，要胜利地完成社会主义工业化和农业集体化，从而消灭剥削制度，消灭阶级，建成社会主义社会，并向着共产主义过渡，是完全不可能的。
    苏联人民革命和建设的丰富经验，对于我国人民和全世界人民都是无可估量的贡献，是我们学习的光辉榜样。苏联的存在和对于各国人民革命的支持和援助，是各国人民取得革命胜利的不可缺少的因素。我国人民历来认为我国革命是十月社会主义革命的直接继续。我们十分珍视和感谢苏联人民、苏联共产党和苏联政府长期以来不断给予我们的正义的支持和无私的、巨大的援助。我们伟大的领袖毛泽东主席在“论人民民主专政”一文中曾经指出：中国人找到马克思主义，是经过俄国人介绍的。在十月革命以前，中国人不但不知道列宁、斯大林，也不知道马克思、恩格斯。十月革命一声炮响，给我们送来了马克思列宁主义。”由于马克思列宁主义传入中国，同中国工人运动结合起来，才孕育产生了中国共产党。中国共产党是完全根据列宁的建党原则并以苏联共产党为榜样建立起来的。中国革命在中国共产党的领导下才面目一新，走上了胜利的道路。如果没有中国共产党的领导和苏联无私的援助，我国人民不但不能取得今天社会主义革命的伟大胜利和社会主义建设的光辉成就，也不可能取得1949年资产阶级民主革命的彻底胜利。这是我们中国近百年反帝反封建的历史早经证明了的。我们饮水思源，怎能不更加感谢伟大的苏联人民、伟大的苏联共产党和纪念伟大的十月社会主义革命的功绩呢？
    事实证明，尽管我国革命和建设有自己的特点，具体发展过程同苏联不完全相同，但是十月社会主义革命的基本道路和基本经验，是放之四海而皆准的马克思列宁主义的普遍真理，对于我国是完全适合的。保卫十月革命的光辉道路，在过去和现在都具有极其重大的意义。特别是在苏联共产党第二十次代表大会之后，国际上形形色色的修正主义者乘机抬头，借口反对个人崇拜而反对马克思列宁主义，反对十月革命的基本道路和基本经验，从而完全否定苏联长期以来革命和建设的成就，这股共产主义运动中的歪风同帝国主义反苏反共的疯狂叫嚣彼此呼应，造成了国际上的逆流。在匈牙利反革命复辟的事件后，我国资产阶级右派分子以为有隙可乘，利用今年中国共产党整风运动，煽风点火，八方响应，公然发动反共反人民反社会主义的猖狂进攻。他们集中地反对中国共产党的领导，反对我国社会主义制度，实质上也就是反对我们走十月社会主义革命的道路，妄想把我国重新拉回到殖民地半殖民地的悲惨道路上去。这是全中国人民所绝对不能容许的。中国人民不能不万众一心，振臂奋起，给予右派分子以迎头痛击。中国人民反击资产阶级右派的斗争已经在各方面取得了决定性的胜利，现在正向全面展开，彻底深入。我们完全相信，我国人民在这次政治上、思想上的社会主义革命的伟大运动中一定能够获得最后的胜利。我国人民将始终不渝地沿着十月社会主义革命的光辉道路胜利前进！
