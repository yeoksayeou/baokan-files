Xinhua News Agency, Ankara, October 28th: The Turkish general election was held on October 27th. According to unofficial preliminary vote counts, the ruling Democratic Party has won the vast majority of seats, but its position in parliament has been greatly weakened compared to the previous parliament.

	The preliminary unofficial results are: the Democratic Party has won 408 of the 610 seats in the new parliament, the main opposition Republican People's Party has won 194 seats, and the Freedom Party and the Republican Nation Party have each won 4 seats.

	In the previous parliament, the Democratic Party held 472 of the 542 seats, while the Republican People's Party held only 31 seats. Due to the increase in the Turkish population, this parliament has increased from the original 542 seats to 610 seats.

	The leader of the Republican People's Party and former President Inönü told a press conference today that the government had used illegal means in the election.

    土耳其举行大选
    据新华社28日讯　安卡拉消息：土耳其大选在10月27日举行。据非正式的初步计票结果，执政的民主党已经获得绝大多数席位，但是它在议会中的地位比上届议会大为削弱。
    初步的非正式结果是：民主党已经获得新议会六百一十席中的四百零八席，主要的反对党共和人民党获得一百九十四席，自由党和国家共和党各四席。
    在上届议会中，民主党占有五百四十二席中的四百七十二席，共和人民党只有三十一席。由于土耳其人口增加，这届议会由原来的五百四十二席增加到六百一十席。
    共和人民党领袖、前总统伊诺努今天在记者招待会上指责政府在选举中采取了不合法的手段。
