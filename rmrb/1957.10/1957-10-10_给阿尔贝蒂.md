    To Alberti
    Zou Jiang
    Far away from beloved Spain,
    Rafael's heart is filled with sorrow.
    Far away from beloved Spain,
    Rafael's heart longs for his homeland.
    You love the carnations of Seville,
    The blue waves of the Bay of Cadiz,
    The ears of wheat under the sky of Castile,
    And the myrtle of Granada.
    You remember the blooming lemon blossoms,
    Dyeing the Guadalquivir River pale,
    The olive groves of Cordoba,
    The trembling of the poplars on the banks of the Duero.
    But you love your compatriots even more,
    Who are resisting Franco.
    But you remember your comrades even more,
    Who have already heroically fallen.
    Far away from beloved Spain,
    Rafael's heart is filled with longing.
    Far away from beloved Spain,
    Rafael's heart longs for his homeland.

    Note: Rafael Alberti (born in 1902) – Spain's most famous anti-fascist poet. He was forced to leave Spain in 1939 and has lived in South America ever since, continuing to write poetry and constantly caring for and encouraging the people of his motherland in their struggle against Franco. He visited our country this spring. The second and third stanzas of the poem are taken from the poem "Returning to the Soviet Union," written by the poet last year in Moscow, and the places mentioned in it are all in Spain.

    给阿尔贝蒂
    邹绛
    远远离开亲爱的西班牙
    拉菲尔心里充满了忧伤
    远远离开亲爱的西班牙
    拉菲尔心里怀念着故乡
    你爱塞维尔那里的石竹
    加的斯海湾蓝色的波浪
    卡斯蒂里天空下的麦穗
    还有格兰那达的桃金娘
    你记得盛开的柠檬花朵
    染成苍白的瓜达几维河
    科尔巴多的橄榄树丛林
    杜罗河岸边白杨的哆嗦
    但你更热爱你的同胞们
    他们正在将弗朗哥反抗
    但你更记得你的同志们
    他们早已经英勇地阵亡
    远远离开亲爱的西班牙
    拉菲尔心里充满了渴望
    远远离开亲爱的西班牙
    拉菲尔心里怀念着故乡
    注：拉菲尔·阿尔贝蒂（1902年生）——西班牙最著名的反法西斯诗人。1939年被迫离开西班牙，一直住在南美，仍然不断地写诗，不断地关心和鼓舞祖国人民反弗朗哥的斗争。今年春天曾经来我国访问。诗中第二、三两节引自诗人去年在莫斯科写的“回到苏联”一诗，里面提到的地方都在西班牙。
