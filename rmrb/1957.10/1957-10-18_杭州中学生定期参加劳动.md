Hangzhou Middle School Students Regularly Participate in Labor

　　(Our dispatch) To cultivate students' labor concepts, the Hangzhou Education Bureau has, starting this semester, required all middle schools to establish regular contact systems with nearby agricultural cooperatives, under the principle of not hindering students' systematic learning and health. They will organize students from the third year of junior high school and above (and students in the first and second years in suburban schools) to participate in agricultural labor on a rotating basis. The Education Bureau requires that each middle school student have the opportunity to participate in physical labor at least once a month on average. Each school can also arrange three days each semester for collective labor in the countryside based on the needs of the rural areas. During the holidays, in addition to educating students to return home to engage in production, schools should also organize students to go to the countryside to help farmers with short-term voluntary labor.
　　This regulation of the Hangzhou Education Bureau has been supported and welcomed by the majority of teachers and students. Hangzhou No. 2 Middle School and No. 6 Middle School have already established contact with suburban agricultural cooperatives and regularly participate in labor.

　　杭州中学生定期参加劳动
    本报讯　杭州市教育局为了培养学生的劳动观念，从这学期起，要求各中学在不妨碍学生系统学习和健康的原则下，与附近的农业社建立经常的联系制度，定期轮流组织初三以上学生（郊区学校还组织初一、二年级学生）参加农业劳动。教育局要求每个中学生每月平均至少有一次参加体力劳动的机会；各校每学期还可根据农村需要，排出三天时间集体下乡劳动。在假期内，除教育学生回家生产外，学校还应组织学生下乡帮助农民进行短期的义务劳动。
    杭州市教育局这项规定，受到广大师生的拥护和欢迎。杭州二中、六中已和郊区农业社建立了联系，定期参加劳动。
