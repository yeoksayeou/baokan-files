Xinhua News Agency, 9th October: TASS reports: By 6:00 AM Moscow time on October 9th, the artificial satellite had orbited the Earth sixty-three times. So far, no change in the distance between the satellite and the carrier rocket following it in orbit has been observed.

Many Soviet observation stations and many locations abroad have reported visual and radio-technical observations of the artificial satellite. The listening distance of the satellite's radio signals far exceeds the expected distance. In individual cases, the receiving distance for a frequency of 20 MHz (wavelength 15 meters) reached 10,000 kilometers. This proves that the received material helps to fundamentally determine scientific data related to radio wave propagation and the structure of the ionosphere.

News reports indicate that the actual time of the satellite's passage and the expected values are in good agreement. For example, observers in Arizona, USA, accurately saw the satellite pass visually according to schedule. They also received the satellite's radio signals at the same time. However, radio enthusiasts should note that the transmission of satellite signals may stop after some time due to depletion of power reserves.

The task specified in the work plan for launching the artificial Earth satellite - using radio direction finding stations and a large number of observations by radio enthusiasts to determine orbital parameters - has been completed. Valuable material has been obtained. After the satellite's signal stops transmitting, observations will continue using optical instruments and radar stations.

    人造卫星已绕地球六十三圈
    经过的时间和预计数值符合
    新华社9日讯　据塔斯社讯：到10月9日莫斯科时间六点为止，人造卫星已经环绕地球转了六十三圈。直到目前，还没有发现卫星同沿轨道在它后面运行的运载火箭之间的距离发生变化。
    苏联许多观测站和外国许多地方纷纷报告肉眼观察和无线电技术观测人造卫星的情况。卫星无线电讯号的收听距离远远超过预期的距离。在个别情况下，频率二十兆赫（波长十五公尺）的收距离达一万公里。这证明，收听的材料有助于从根本上确定与无线电波的传播和电离层的结构问题有关的科学数据。
    传来的消息表明，卫星经过的真正时间和预计的数值是很好地符合的。例如，美国亚利桑那州的观察者们准确地按照时间表用肉眼看见了卫星的经过。他们还在同一时间收听到卫星发来的无线电讯号。但是无线电爱好者应该注意到，卫星讯号的发送经过若干时间可能由于电源储备用完而停止。
    发射人造地球卫星的工作计划所规定的任务——利用无线电测向站和无线电爱好者的大量观测来确定轨道参数的任务已经完成。获得了珍贵的材料。在卫星的讯号停止发送以后将利用光学仪器和雷达站继续进行观测。
