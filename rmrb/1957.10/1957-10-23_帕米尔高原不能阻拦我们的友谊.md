    The Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Afghanistan, Sardar Mohammed Daoud, is scheduled to arrive in Beijing today at the invitation of our Premier Zhou Enlai. The Chinese people, with great joy and excitement, warmly welcome the distinguished guests from our neighboring country across the Pamir Plateau and sincerely thank him for bringing the warm and friendly sentiments of the Afghan people. This is an important symbol of the new development of friendly relations between China and Afghanistan.
    Both China and Afghanistan are countries that deeply cherish independence, peace, and friendship. There has never been ill will or animosity between our two countries. Our ancestors pioneered the "Silk Road," which linked our two countries through culture, religion, and trade. As early as the second century BC, our famous Zhang Qian visited Afghanistan. Later, in the fifth and seventh centuries AD, our famous Faxian and Xuanzang also traveled to Afghanistan. Although this historical close contact was once interrupted due to the imperialist invasion and oppression of both our countries, just as the natural obstacles of the Pamir Plateau could not prevent the exchanges between our ancestors, the artificial obstruction of the imperialists could not permanently sever the friendship between our two peoples.
    The Kingdom of Afghanistan was one of the first countries to recognize New China. Since our two countries restored their traditional friendship on a new basis, the friendly and cooperative relations between the two countries have developed rapidly. Last year, Afghanistan sent a cultural delegation and the Mayor of Kabul to visit our country, and earlier this year, an economic delegation made a friendly visit to our country. From China, last year there were visits to Afghanistan by a cultural and artistic delegation, an Islamic pilgrimage group, and an industrial exhibition group. In August of this year, our football team went to Kabul to participate in Afghanistan's annual Independence Day celebrations. In July of this year, our two countries signed a trade and payment agreement, and we will also begin exchanging students. Earlier this year, the Chinese government delegation, headed by Premier Zhou Enlai, paid a friendly visit to Afghanistan and received a warm welcome and reception from the Afghan government and people. Now, Prime Minister Daoud is personally visiting our country. All the friendly visits by leaders of both countries and the frequent contacts and exchanges in economic, cultural and other fields, not only fully conform to the interests of the independent development and peaceful construction of the Chinese and Afghan peoples, but will also inevitably contribute to the cause of world peace and friendly cooperation among the Asian people.
    The Afghan people possess a noble ideal of independence and freedom, and have waged a heroic and determined struggle to defend their independence and freedom, resisting imperialist aggression. The British imperialists launched three wars of aggression against Afghanistan in 1838, 1878, and 1919, but under the heroic and tenacious resistance of the Afghan people, all three British invasions ultimately ended in failure. The Chinese people have always expressed great respect for the Afghan people's noble national character and glorious historical tradition of resisting aggression and defending independence. Now, the Afghan people are advancing on the road of independent development.
    The Afghan people not only cherish their own independence and freedom but also sympathize with and support the struggles of other nations for independence and freedom. Afghanistan supports the national liberation movement in North Africa and the national self-determination demands of Cyprus; it criticizes the aggressive Baghdad Pact and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, and resolutely supports Egypt's recovery of the Suez Canal, opposing the Anglo-French armed aggression against Egypt. Afghanistan is a participating country in the Asian-African Conference, and it supports the various resolutions of the Bandung Conference and the famous Ten Principles. At the end of 1955, the joint statement of the Afghan and Soviet government leaders affirmed the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, advocated universal disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons, and confirmed the necessity of peaceful consultation to resolve international disputes and ease international tensions. Earlier this year, the joint communiqué of our Premier Zhou Enlai and Prime Minister Daoud reiterated their support for the principles of the Bandung Conference and support for the Asian and African people to cooperate and understand each other in order to maintain their freedom and independence and promote world peace. We clearly know that the Chinese and Afghan people are completely united in the struggle for and safeguarding the independence and freedom of all peoples, against colonialism, and in the cause of defending peace and opposing war. Our friendship is built and developed on the basis of this common stance and common aspiration.
    After the plot of the U.S. imperialists to carry out subversive activities against Syria was shattered, they are now actively instigating Turkey to act as a cat's paw for them and carry out military adventures. The flames of war in the Middle East are about to erupt, and world peace is facing a serious threat. Afghan public opinion agrees with the Soviet Union and other peace-loving countries in their support for Syria, and the Chinese people have repeatedly expressed their firm support for Syria's just struggle against colonial aggression. This once again shows that on the most critical issues of peace and war in the current international situation, the positions and aspirations of the Chinese and Afghan people are also consistent.
    The Afghan government is pursuing an independent and autonomous policy against colonialism, a policy of peaceful coexistence, against war and military aggression blocs, and a policy of developing friendly relations between countries. Prime Minister Daoud himself, as the leader of the Afghan government, is playing a very important role in this regard. He has repeatedly solemnly declared that independence is the glory and dignity of Afghanistan; the Afghan government expresses its firm opposition to colonialism and to the infringement of the rights and freedoms of the masses of humanity; Afghanistan will not participate in foreign treaty organizations because this is contrary to Afghanistan's interests. Prime Minister Daoud has implemented this policy, which is in line with the interests of the Afghan people and with international peace and friendly cooperation, not only in his words, but also in the practice of national political life and international affairs. The Afghan government has adopted a firm stance against the threats and inducements of U.S. and British imperialism, as well as various destructive activities. The Chinese people express their admiration for Prime Minister Daoud's efforts and achievements in these areas.
    Today, our people are honored to be able to welcome distinguished guests from afar in our capital. We are deeply convinced that through Prime Minister Daoud's visit to our country, our mutual understanding and trust will be further enhanced, thereby better promoting the friendly and cooperative relations between our two countries based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.

### 帕米尔高原不能阻拦我们的友谊

    帕米尔高原不能阻拦我们的友谊
    阿富汗王国首相萨达尔·穆罕默德·达乌德应我国周恩来总理的邀请，定于今天到达北京。我国人民怀着极大愉快和兴奋的心情，热烈欢迎来自帕米尔高原那边的我们邻邦的贵宾，并衷心感谢他带来了阿富汗人民亲切友好的情谊。这是中阿两国友好关系新发展的重要标志。
    中阿两国都是酷爱独立、和平友好的国家。我们两国在历史上从来没有恶感和仇视，我们的祖先所开辟的是两国间文化、宗教的联系和贸易上的“丝绸之路”。早在公元前一百余年就有我国著名的张骞到过阿富汗，后来在公元五世纪和七世纪时，又有我国著名的法显和玄奘到过阿富汗。这种历史的亲密交往，虽然后来由于我们两国都遭到帝国主义的侵略、压迫而一度中断，但是正像帕米尔高原的自然障碍不能阻隔我们祖先的来往一样，帝国主义者的人为阻挠也无法长期拦断我们两国人民间的友谊。
    阿富汗王国是最早承认新中国的国家之一。自从我们两国在新的基础上恢复起传统友谊之后，两国之间的友好合作关系获得了迅速的发展。阿富汗去年有文化代表团、喀布尔市长来访我国，今年初又有经济代表团来我国作友好访问。我国访问阿富汗的，去年有文化艺术代表团、伊斯兰教朝圣团、工业展览团等，今年8月又有我国足球代表队赴喀布尔参加阿富汗一年一度盛大的独立节庆祝活动。今年7月，我们两国签订了贸易和支付协定，我们两国还将开始互派留学生。今年初，以周恩来总理为首的中国政府代表团对阿富汗进行友好访问，受到阿富汗政府和人民热情的欢迎和接待。现在达乌德首相又亲自前来我国访问。所有两国领导人的友好访问和经济文化各方面频繁的接触和交流，不仅完全符合中阿两国人民独立发展和和平建设的利益，也必然有助于世界和平和亚洲人民的友好合作事业。
    阿富汗人民是富于独立自由的崇高理想的，并且为了保卫自己的独立自由进行了英勇坚决的斗争，抗击帝国主义的侵略。英帝国主义者曾在1838年、1878年和1919年先后三次发动过侵略阿富汗的战争，但是在阿富汗人民英勇顽强的抗击下，英国的三次侵略最后都不得不以失败告终。中国人民对阿富汗人民反抗侵略、捍卫独立的崇高的民族品质和光荣的历史传统，向来表示极大的敬意和尊重。现在，阿富汗人民正在独立发展的道路上前进。
    阿富汗人民不但珍爱自己的独立和自由，而且同情和支持其他民族争取独立自由的斗争。阿富汗支持北非的民族解放运动，支持塞浦路斯的民族自决要求；它抨击侵略性的巴格达军事集团和东南亚军事集团，坚决支持埃及收复苏伊士运河，反对英法武装侵略埃及。阿富汗是亚非会议的参加国，它拥护万隆会议的各项决议和著名的十项原则。1955年底，阿富汗和苏联政府领袖的联合声明中，肯定了和平共处五项原则，主张普遍裁军和禁止原子武器，确认和平协商解决国际争端和缓和国际紧张局势的必要。今年初，我国周恩来总理和达乌德首相的联合公报中，又重申支持万隆会议的原则，支持亚非人民为维护他们的自由和独立、促进世界和平而进行合作和了解。我们清楚地知道，中阿两国人民在争取和维护各国人民的独立自由、反对殖民主义的斗争中，在保卫和平、反对战争的事业中，是完全站在一道的。我们的友谊是在这种共同立场和共同愿望的基础上建立和发展起来的。
    美帝国主义者在对叙利亚进行颠覆活动的阴谋被粉碎后，目前正在积极唆使土耳其为它火中取栗，进行军事冒险。中东的战火一触即发，世界和平遭到了严重的威胁。阿富汗的舆论赞同苏联和其他爱好和平的国家对叙利亚的声援，中国人民也一再表示坚决支持叙利亚反抗殖民侵略的正义斗争。这又一次说明，对于目前国际局势中最尖锐的和平和战争的问题，中阿两国人民的立场和愿望也是一致的。
    阿富汗政府执行着独立自主和反对殖民主义的政策，执行着和平共处、反对战争和军事侵略集团的政策，执行着发展各国间友好关系的政策。达乌德首相本人作为阿富汗政府的领导人，在这方面是起着十分重要的作用的。他曾一再郑重宣称独立是阿富汗的光荣和尊严；阿富汗政府对于殖民主义和对于侵害人类大众的权利和自由，表示坚决的反对；阿富汗将不参加外国条约组织，因为这是同阿富汗的利益相抵触的。达乌德首相不仅在言论上，并且在国家政治生活和国际事务关系的实践中，执行了这种符合于阿富汗人民的利益、符合于国际和平和友好合作的利益的政策。对于美英帝国主义的威胁利诱以及各种破坏活动，阿富汗政府采取了坚定的立场。中国人民对于达乌德首相在这些方面所作的努力及其成就表示钦佩。
    今天，我国人民很荣幸地能够在自己的首都欢迎远道来访的贵宾。我们深信，通过达乌德首相这一次到我国的访问，必然会进一步增进我们彼此间的了解和信任，从而把我们两国基于和平共处五项原则的友好合作关系更好地推向前进。
