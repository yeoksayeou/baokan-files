Xinhua News Agency, 30th - According to the State Statistical Bureau, the total investment in basic construction stipulated in the first Five-Year Plan can reach 43.2 billion yuan by the end of September, exceeding the plan by 0.01% and completing it three months ahead of schedule. Among them, local areas exceeded the plan by 15%; the central departments have also reached 98% and only need one month to complete it. The central departments that have already completed the five-year investment plan include: agricultural, forestry, and water conservancy departments, transportation departments, and finance, trade, and grain departments; the industrial departments have completed 92%. The cultural, educational, and health departments only completed 77% of the original investment amount stipulated in the five-year plan because necessary adjustments were made to the investment targets stipulated in the five-year plan.

In four years and nine months, the newly added fixed assets value in my country was 32.26 billion yuan, which is 156% of the net value of fixed assets in 1952. Among them, the newly added fixed assets in the industrial sector were 17.64 billion yuan, which is 174% of the net value of fixed assets in 1952. From 1861, when Anqing and Shanghai established ordnance factories, to 1949, it took ninety years for China to have modern industry. The original value of industrial fixed assets only reached 15.8 billion yuan. The industrial fixed assets added in the four years and nine months of the first Five-Year Plan in New China exceeded the ninety years of old China.

According to the five-year plan, there are 694 industrial projects above the limit under construction. It is estimated that by the end of this year, it will reach 825, which is 131 more than planned. As the industrial construction center of the first Five-Year Plan, "156" projects, it is expected that 131 can be under construction. The so-called "item", except for a few power transmission lines in power projects and other individual projects, generally refers to a joint enterprise, a factory, or a mine. The construction of 825 projects above the limit within five years is equivalent to saying that on average, there will be more than one factory or mine above the limit starting construction every two days.

Among the 825 projects above the limit, there are 700 in the central departments and 125 in various provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the central government. Among the 700 projects in the central departments, the important ones include: 196 coal mines, two more than planned; 152 power stations and line projects, 39 more than planned; 18 ferrous metal plants and mines, three more than planned; 32 non-ferrous metal plants and mines, one more than planned; 104 metal processing and machinery manufacturing plants, 18 more than planned; 33 chemical plants, one more than planned; 26 building material factories, five more than planned; 75 cotton, hemp, silk, wool, and man-made synthetic fiber textile printing and dyeing factories, 22 more than planned; 24 paper mills, 14 more than planned; 48 sugar and food factories (fields), 14 more than planned; the number of oil plants and mines is 12 due to the reduction of one.

In four years and nine months, a total of 402 factories and mining projects above the limit were put into production partially or entirely, of which 53 of the "156" projects were put into production in whole or in part. On average, during this period, my country has more than one factory and mining enterprise above the limit being put into production in whole or in part every four days. The factories and mines that have been put into full production include: Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Plant, Harbin Boiler Plant, Harbin Instrument Plant, Changchun First Automobile Plant, Shenyang First Machine Tool Plant, Beijing Electron Tube Factory, Taiyuan Thermal Power Plant, Fularji Thermal Power Plant, Chongqing Power Plant, Fuxin Haizhou Open-pit Mine, Hegang Dongshan Vertical Shaft, fifteen state-owned cotton textile factories in Beijing, Shijiazhuang, Zhengzhou and Shaanxi; many major projects of Anshan Iron and Steel Company have also been completed, such as seamless steel pipe plant, large rolling mill, flotation plant, new sintering plant and six large blast furnaces.

With the commissioning of hundreds of large and relatively large factories and mines, my country's industrial production capacity has greatly increased. From 1953 to the end of September this year, the new production capacity (calculated annually) due to investment is mainly as follows: coal mining capacity is more than 51 million tons, oil exploitation capacity is more than 1.48 million tons, iron smelting capacity is 3.2 million tons, steel smelting capacity is 3.3 million tons, sulfuric acid production capacity is 287,000 tons, soda ash production capacity is 165,000 tons, cement production capacity is more than 1.9 million tons, tire production capacity is more than 640,000 sets, machine-made paper production capacity is more than 180,000 tons, machine-made sugar production capacity is more than 430,000 tons, metal cutting machine tool manufacturing capacity is more than 5,700 units, power generation capacity, calculated by power generation equipment, is more than 1.8 million kilowatts; spinning capacity, calculated by spindles, is 1.769 million; weaving capacity, calculated by looms, is 46,600 units. Among the above-mentioned newly added production capacity, the central industrial departments have exceeded the plan in soda ash, machine-made paper, pig iron, spindles, metal cutting machine tools, synthetic petroleum, sulfuric acid, etc.

In terms of transportation, in four years and nine months, a total of 36 new railway trunk lines and branch lines were built, of which 16 have been completed, such as Jier Railway, Baolan Railway, Chengyu Railway, Fengsha Railway, Lizhan Railway, Yingxia Railway, Baobai Railway, Baocheng Railway, etc. More than 4,600 kilometers of new railways have been built, accounting for 112.8% of the five-year plan. If the repaired lines are included, the mileage of new and repaired railways will reach 5,000 kilometers, accounting for 117% of the five-year plan, averaging more than 1,000 kilometers per year. In addition, the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge has been fully completed. In four years and nine months, a total of more than 40,000 kilometers of highways have been built. The important lines include the Kangzang Highway and the Qinghai-Tibet Highway, totaling more than 50 lines. Among them, the new highway mileage of the Ministry of Transport is more than 8,370 kilometers, accounting for 115% of the five-year plan.

In terms of agriculture, forestry, and water conservancy, in four years and nine months, the total new reservoir flood storage capacity was more than 7.2 billion cubic meters, of which the Ministry of Water Conservancy completed 6.56 billion cubic meters, accounting for 106% of the five-year plan. The major reservoirs that have been repaired include: Guanting Reservoir, Nanwan Reservoir, Meishan Reservoir, Boshan Reservoir, and Foziling Reservoir. The irrigated area has increased by more than 2.1 million hectares, of which the Ministry of Water Conservancy is 414,000 hectares, completing 110.5% of the five-year plan. More than 13,000 tractors (standard units) were purchased. In addition, the state and the masses reclaimed more than 80 million mu of wasteland during this period. These construction achievements are of extreme importance to ensuring increased agricultural production in my country.

In terms of culture, education, health and living welfare, in four years and nine months, the construction area of universities and colleges was 7.05 million square meters, and the construction area of ordinary middle schools and secondary normal schools reached 10 million square meters; the total number of hospital beds increased by more than 85,000. In addition, the state built more than 66 million square meters of employee housing in the first four years. It is estimated that the cumulative construction of employee housing can reach about 80 million square meters by the end of this year. This fully demonstrates the great concern of the Communist Party and the People's Government for all aspects of the lives of the working people.

    在四年零九个月中，我国新增加的固定资产价值三百二十二点六亿元，为1952年固定资产净值的156％。其中工业部门新增固定资产一百七十六点四亿元，为1952年固定资产净值的174％。我国自1861年在安庆和上海建立军械所开始有近代化工业起，到1949年止，经历了九十年，工业固定资产按原值计算，才达到一百五十八亿元，新中国只第一个五年计划期间的四年零九个月所增加的工业固定资产就超过了旧中国的九十年。
    按照五年计划规定，工业方面施工的限额以上的项目为六百九十四个，预计到今年年底，可达八百二十五个，比计划多一百三十一个。作为第一个五年计划工业建设中心的“一百五十六”项，已施工的预计可以达一百三十一个。所谓一“项”，除少数电力工程中的输电线路和其他个别工程以外，一般地就是指一个联合企业、一个厂或一个矿。五年之内限额以上项目施工达八百二十五个，等于说五年之内平均每两天多就有一个限额以上的厂矿开始施工。
    在八百二十五个限额以上的项目中，中央各部门有七百个，各省、自治区、直辖市有一百二十五个。在中央的七百个项目中，重要的有：煤矿一百九十六个，比计划多二个；电站和线路工程一百五十二个，比计划多三十九个；黑色金属厂矿十八个，比计划多三个；有色金属厂矿三十二个，比计划多一个；金属加工和机械制造厂一百零四个，比计划多十八个；化工厂三十三个，比计划多一个；建筑材料厂二十六个，比计划多五个；棉、麻、丝、毛和人造合成纤维的纺织印染厂七十五个，比计划多二十二个；造纸厂二十四个，比计划多十四个；制糖和食品厂（场）四十八个，比计划多十四个；石油厂矿因削减一个，只有十二个。
    在四年零九个月中，部分或全部投入生产的限额以上的厂矿工程共四百零二个，其中“一百五十六”项全部或部分投入生产的已达五十三个。平均在这期间每四天多我国就有一个限额以上的厂矿全部或部分投入生产。已经全部投入生产的厂矿有：哈尔滨量具刃具厂、哈尔滨锅炉厂、哈尔滨仪表厂、长春第一汽车厂、沈阳第一机床厂、北京电子管厂、太原热电站、富拉尔基热电站、重庆电厂、阜新海州露天矿、鹤岗东山立井，北京、石家庄、郑州和陕西等地十五个国营棉纺织厂；鞍山钢铁公司的许多重大工程也已完工，如无缝钢管厂、大型轧钢厂、浮选厂、新烧结厂和六个大高炉。
    随着几百个大的和比较大的厂矿投入生产，我国工业生产能力已有巨大增长。自1953年到今年9月底止，由于投资而新增加的生产能力（以年计算）主要如下：采煤能力为五千一百多万吨，石油开采能力为一百四十八万多吨，炼铁能力为三百二十万吨，炼钢能力为三百三十万吨，硫酸的生产能力为二十八点七万吨，纯碱的生产能力为十六点五万吨，水泥的生产能力为一百九十多万吨，轮胎的生产能力为六十四万多套，机制纸的生产能力为十八万多吨，机制糖的生产能力为四十三万多吨，金属切削机床的制造能力为五千七百多台，发电能力，以发电设备计算为一百八十多万瓩；纺纱能力，以纱锭计算为一百七十六点九万枚；织布能力，以织布机计算为四点六六万台。以上新增生产能力中，中央各工业部有纯碱、机制纸、生铁、纱锭、金属切削机床、人造石油、硫酸等超过了计划。
    在交通运输方面，四年零九个月共新建铁路干线和支线三十六条，已建成的有十六条，如集二线、宝兰线、成渝线、丰沙线、黎湛线、鹰厦线、包白线、宝成线等。新建铁路四千六百多公里，为五年计划的112.8％，若包括修复线路在内，则新建和修复铁路里程将达五千公里，为五年计划的117％，平均每年在一千公里以上，此外，武汉长江大桥已全部完工。四年零九个月共修建公路四万多公里，重要线路有康藏公路、青藏公路等约五十多条，其中新增公路里程交通部为八千三百七十多公里，为五年计划的115％。
