Xinhua News Agency, October 30th dispatch from New York (TASS): The United Nations General Assembly continued its discussion of Syria's complaint that its security and international peace are threatened at its morning session on the 29th.

Syrian Foreign Minister Bitar, in his speech, emphasized that the representatives of Turkey and the United States, in their speeches, tried their best to shift the entire issue to the aspect of the "Cold War" to evade answering the substance of Syria's complaint. Bitar said that Syria's purpose in submitting the complaint to the United Nations General Assembly for discussion was to eliminate the threat to its security and safeguard international peace. The Syrian government only submitted this complaint when it was unable to persuade Turkey to withdraw its troops from the Syrian-Turkish border and ease the atmosphere in the region.

He said that some countries do not like Syria's independent policy, and they are vigorously launching a wave of slander. Syria, with only four million residents, is being said to pose a threat not only to the Middle East but also to the entire "free" world. Bitar pointed out that some countries also spread similar rumors when preparing to invade Egypt.

The Syrian representative pointed out that the United States, Turkey, and certain countries insisted on saying that Syria's purchase of weapons for self-defense was a threat to Syria's neighbors. He questioned why a country that did not participate in any military alliance would cause a "threat" by purchasing a small amount of weapons, while Israel, which had obtained a large number of weapons, and Turkey, which was fully armed, would not "cause a threat"? Bitar said that attempting to cast doubt on Syria's right to purchase weapons for self-defense was interfering in Syria's internal affairs.

Bitar refuted Turkey's slander that foreign army bases, naval bases, and arsenals were being established in Syria, and he asked the Turkish representative to name these fabricated bases.

Bitar finally emphasized that the situation on the Syrian-Turkish border was dangerous, and he called on the United Nations General Assembly to treat Syria's complaint with extreme seriousness.

Next, Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko spoke. He pointed out that the planners of the aggression against Syria had not been able to disrupt the General Assembly's discussion of the issues raised by the Syrian government, and he expressed his satisfaction with this.

However, he emphasized that in order to eliminate the threat to Syria's security, and thus eliminate the threat to peace and security in the Middle East and to universal peace, the United Nations General Assembly should not only do this, but also adopt a number of resolutions. This refers to a resolution on studying the situation on the Syrian-Turkish border and a resolution on requiring United Nations member states to take measures to stop aggression and punish the perpetrators of peace destruction, even to the use of force, in the event of an armed attack on Syria.

The head of the Soviet delegation exposed the diplomatic tactics of Western countries: they want to divert world public opinion from the substance of the issue and present the world with a fait accompli by using tricks such as making the situation in the Middle East seem insignificant and slandering the Soviet Union. The Soviet representative emphasized that the Soviet Union's accusations were well-founded. The Soviet Union accused Turkey because it was planning a military attack on Syria, and the Soviet Union accused the United States because it was encouraging Turkey and instigating it to take extremely serious steps and embark on this dangerous road.

After Gromyko contrasted the policies of the Soviet Union and the United States towards Middle Eastern countries with examples, he emphasized that all of this shows that the situation around Syria is the result of the United States' current policy towards Middle Eastern countries.

Gromyko pointed out that Britain should also bear a lot of responsibility for the current tension on the Syrian-Turkish border. The Soviet representative drew the attention of the British delegation to all the serious consequences contained in Britain's support for the dangerous tricks planned by certain people in the United States in the Near and Middle East.

Gromyko finally supported Syria's proposal that the United Nations establish an impartial commission to investigate the situation on the Syrian-Turkish border.

The head of the Ukrainian Republic delegation, Paramarchuk, also spoke in support of Syria's proposal to send a commission to investigate the Syrian-Turkish border situation and submit a report to the General Assembly.

The representatives of Pakistan, Italy, Belgium, and the Chiang Kai-shek clique spoke at the meeting to defend Turkey's aggressive policies.

    美土在联大回避答复
    叙利亚控诉实质叙外长呼吁严肃对待叙控诉案
    苏联要求通过决议采取措施制止侵略
    据新华社30日讯　据塔斯社纽约讯：联合国大会29日上午会议继续讨论了叙利亚对它的安全和国际和平遭到威胁的控诉案。
    叙利亚外交部长比塔尔在发言时强调指出，土耳其、美国两国的代表在他们的发言中竭力企图把全部问题转移到
  “冷战”的方面来回避答复叙利亚控诉的实质。比塔尔说，叙利亚把控诉案提交联合国大会讨论的目的就是要消除对自己安全的威胁和维护国际和平。叙利亚政府只是到了没有办法说服土耳其把它的军队撤出叙土边境从而缓和这个地区的气氛时，才提出这个控诉的。
    他说，某些国家不喜欢叙利亚的独立政策，它们大力掀起诬蔑的浪潮。只有四百万居民的叙利亚被说成似乎不仅在中东，而且在整个“自由”世界制造威胁。比塔尔指出，一些国家在准备侵略埃及时也散布过类似的谰言。
    叙利亚代表指出，美国、土耳其和某些国家硬把叙利亚购买用以自卫的武器说成是对叙利亚的邻国的威胁，他质问说，为什么一个没有参加任何军事联盟的国家购买了少量的武器就会造成“威胁”，而获得了大量武器的以色列和混身武装的土耳其竟不会“造成威胁”？比塔尔说，企图让人怀疑叙利亚有购买武器以自卫的权利的做法就是干涉叙利亚的内政。
    比塔尔驳斥了土耳其所作的关于叙利亚境内正在建立外国陆军基地、海军基地和兵工厂的诬蔑，他要求土耳其代表举出这些捏造的基地的名称来。
    比塔尔最后强调指出，土叙边境的局势是危险的，他呼吁联合国大会极其严肃地对待叙利亚的控诉案。
    接着，苏联外交部长葛罗米柯发言。他指出，侵略叙利亚的策划者没有能够破坏大会讨论叙利亚政府提出来的问题，他对此表示满意。
    但是他强调说，为了消除对叙利亚安全的威胁，从而消除对中东和平和安全以及对普遍和平的威胁，联合国大会应该不仅做到这点，而且应该通过若干决议。这里指的是关于研究叙土边境局势的决议和关于要求联合国会员国在一旦叙利亚遭到武装进攻时，采取措施以制止侵略和惩办破坏和平的祸首，直到使用武力为止的决议。
    苏联代表团团长揭露了西方国家的外交手法：它们想通过把中东局势说成若无其事和诽谤苏联这样一些花招来转移世界舆论对问题实质的注意并且使世界面对既成事实。苏联代表强调指出，苏联提出指责是有充分理由的。苏联所以指责土耳其是因为它在策划对叙利亚的军事进攻，苏联指责美国是因为它怂恿土耳其，唆使它采取极严重的步骤，走上这条危险的道路。
    葛罗米柯用实例对比了苏联和美国对待中东国家的政策以后强调指出，这一切表明，叙利亚周围的局势是美国对中近东国家采取现行政策方针的结果。
    葛罗米柯指出，英国对目前叙土边境的紧张局势也应负担不少的责任。苏联代表提请英国代表团注意英国支持美国某些人士在中近东策划的危险把戏所包藏的全部严重后果。
    葛罗米柯最后支持叙利亚关于联合国成立一个公正的委员会来调查叙土边境局势的建议。
    乌克兰共和国代表团团长帕拉马尔楚克也发言支持叙利亚关于派遣委员会去调查叙—土边境情况和向联大提出报告的建议。
    巴基斯坦、意大利、比利时的代表以及蒋介石分子在会上发言为土耳其的侵略政策辩护。
