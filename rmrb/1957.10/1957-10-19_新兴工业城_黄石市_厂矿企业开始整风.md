    Emerging Industrial City – Huangshi City
    Factories and Mines Begin Rectification Campaign
    The rectification movement has unfolded in factories and mines in the emerging industrial city of Huangshi. In recent days, workers in all factories and mines have been carrying out preparatory activities for the rectification campaign. The Daye Steel Plant Party Committee specifically arranged the methods and steps for carrying out the rectification movement and criticized some ideological concerns among leading cadres. The Daye Iron Mine Party and administrative leaders convened forums with workers from various trades to humbly listen to their opinions. The Yuanhua Coal Mine decided to let go and mobilize the masses to carry out extensive airing of views using various forms such as big-character posters, broadcasts, reception rooms, forums, and cartoons. Units that acted quickly have already produced the first batch of big-character posters. Some units have also set up suggestion boxes and writing services to open up airing of views areas for workers.

    新兴工业城——黄石市
    厂矿企业开始整风
    整风运动已在新兴的工业城市——黄石市的厂矿企业中展开。这几天，各厂矿职工都在进行整风的酝酿活动。大冶钢厂党委具体布置了开展整风运动的方法和步骤，并且批判了领导干部中的一些思想顾虑。大冶铁矿党和行政的领导人员召集了各个不同工种的职工进行座谈，虚心听取他们的意见。源华煤矿决定放手发动群众，用大字报、广播、接待室、座谈会、漫画等各种形式开展大鸣大放；行动迅速的单位目前已经出现了第一批大字报。有些单位还设了意见箱、代笔处，为职工开辟鸣放园地。
