　　Wuhan Middle Schools Achieve Victory in the Anti-Rightist Struggle;
    Schools Begin Rectification and Improvement Work One After Another
    (Our newspaper dispatch) The anti-Rightist struggle in Wuhan's seventy-three middle schools has achieved initial victory. According to statistics, one hundred and four rightists have been exposed and criticized by the masses.
    These rightists took advantage of the Party's rectification movement to incite the masses and launch attacks against the Party. Rightist element Xia Guanzhong (Standing Committee member of the Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League, Director of the Culture and Education Committee) of the Teachers' Advanced Studies College, stirred up trouble within the college, saying, "To help the Party with rectification, one should not talk about achievements," "Intellectuals can only become active after pouring out their grievances." He also actively planned with rightist element Shi Zeyan (Chairman of the China Democratic League in the college) to hold a "League-Masses Symposium," inviting those subjected to the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries campaign to vent their bitterness. Rightist element Xia Bodan (Chairman of the China Democratic League) of the Fourteenth Middle School, said at a forum for airing views, "The Communist Party is terminally ill." He also mobilized League members to "only say bad things, not good things; the organization will be responsible if mistakes are made in airing views."
    They progressed from denying the Party's achievements to maliciously slandering the Party's leadership. Rightist element Xiao Yuhui (League member) of the Third Middle School, repeatedly spread the word that "the biggest Party disaster in history was the Donglin Party disaster, and the Communist Party's treatment of intellectuals is worse than the Donglin disaster."
    They also attacked the proletarian dictatorship and the personnel system. Rightist element Liu Xuefeng (League member) of the Fourteenth Middle School, believed that the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries campaign was "a complete mess." Some rightist elements slandered personnel files as "contracts of indenture."
    Rightist element Li Shengjie of the Fourth Middle School, openly incited students and graduates to make trouble. He said to the students, "Go ahead and make trouble! March! If you're going to make trouble, do it like Wuhan University and Peking University. What are you afraid of? You should struggle."
    The conspiracies of these rightists to seize the Party's leadership are sinister and cunning, but under the relentless exposure and stern criticism of the broad masses of teachers, their fallacies have been completely bankrupted, and their ugly faces have been fully exposed. Now that the new academic year has begun, schools have successively transitioned to the rectification movement.

### 武汉中等学校反右派斗争获得胜利  各校先后开始整风改进工作

　　武汉中等学校反右派斗争获得胜利
    各校先后开始整风改进工作
    本报讯　武汉市七十三个中等学校的反右派斗争，已取得初步胜利。据统计，已被群众揭发批判的右派分子有一百零四人。
    这些右派分子利用党的整风，煽动群众，向党进攻。教师进修学院右派分子夏贯中（民盟市委常委、文教委员会主委），在该院进行煽动说：“要帮助党整风，不该谈成绩”，“知识分子吐了苦水才能积极起来”，他并和该院民盟主委右派分子史泽彦积极筹划开“盟群座谈会”，邀请肃反对象吐苦水。第十四中学右派分子夏伯丹（民盟主委）在鸣放座谈会上说：“共产党已病入膏肓，”他并发动盟员“只说坏的，不要说好的，放错了有组织负责”。
    他们由否认党的成绩，进而恶意诬蔑党的领导。第三中学右派分子萧玉辉（盟员）不只一次散布“历史上最大的一次党祸是东林党祸，而共产党对待知识分子比起东林祸来有过之而无不及。”
    他们还攻击无产阶级专政和人事制度。第十四中学右派分子刘雪峰（盟员）认为肃反运动是“一团糟”。有的右派分子诬蔑人事档案是“卖身契约”。
    第四中学右派分子李升杰公开煽动学生和毕业生闹事。他对学生说：“你们闹嘛！游行嘛！要闹就要像武汉大学、北京大学那样闹，你们怕什么，你们应该斗争。”
    这些右派企图夺取党的领导的阴谋是险恶的、巧妙的，但在广大教师的无情揭发和严正批驳下，他们的谬论全部破产，丑恶面目已暴露无余。现在新的学年开始了，各校已先后转入整风运动。
