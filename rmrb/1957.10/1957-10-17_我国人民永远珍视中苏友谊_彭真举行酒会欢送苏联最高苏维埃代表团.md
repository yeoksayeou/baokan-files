    Peng Zhen Holds Reception to Bid Farewell to Soviet Supreme Soviet Delegation
    Xinhua News Agency, October 16th - Beijing Mayor Peng Zhen held a reception at the Beijing Hotel this evening to bid farewell to the Soviet Supreme Soviet Delegation headed by A.B. Aristov.

    In his speech at the reception, Mayor Peng Zhen said that the delegation's visit to China comes at a time when the Chinese people are jubilantly celebrating the 40th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution. The October Revolution opened a new era in human history and had a profound impact on the development of human history. The Chinese people have always regarded the Chinese revolution as a continuation of the Great October Revolution. Peng Zhen also said that the Soviet people have consistently sympathized with and supported the Chinese people's revolutionary struggle and have provided comprehensive and tremendous assistance to our socialist construction. The people of China and the Soviet Union have an eternal and unbreakable fraternal friendship. This friendship, the rock-solid unity of the eight hundred million people of China and the Soviet Union, is the greatest interest of the people of China and the Soviet Union, and a guarantee for world peace and the cause of human progress. The people of Beijing and all the Chinese people will always cherish the deep friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union, and sincerely thank the Soviet people for their fraternal and tremendous assistance to our country.
    In his speech, head of delegation Aristov first thanked the citizens of Beijing and other Chinese cities for their kind reception of the delegation, as well as their warm hospitality to the Soviet people. He said that these once again proved the unbreakable friendship and unity between the Soviet and Chinese people, and demonstrated the unwavering will of the people of China and the Soviet Union to advance hand in hand along the road of building socialism and communism. Aristov said that the delegation was very honored to have the opportunity to participate in the celebration of the eighth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China in Beijing. This festival vividly and convincingly demonstrated the unity of the Chinese people united around the Communist Party and the People's Government. The delegation traveled across China's vast territory and saw the Chinese people's labor enthusiasm, the tangible results of the Chinese people's heroic labor, and their unwavering will and determination to build a socialist society.
    At the end of their speeches, Peng Zhen and Aristov both proposed a toast to the unbreakable great friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union, and to the health of the leaders of the two parties and governments.
