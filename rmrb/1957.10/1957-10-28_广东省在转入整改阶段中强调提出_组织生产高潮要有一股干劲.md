Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, October 26th—The Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a meeting of Party member cadres at the level of department and bureau chiefs on the evening of the 24th. Tao Zhu, First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, announced on behalf of the Provincial Party Committee at the meeting that Guangdong Province's rectification movement is transitioning from the stage of counterattacking the Rightists to a stage focusing on rectification and reform.

Comrade Tao Zhu said that rectifying the work style of the Party's leading organs and leading cadres, and improving the work of the Party's leading organs and leading cadres, is the fundamental purpose of our Party's launching of the rectification campaign. The Party called on the masses inside and outside the Party to freely express their opinions and criticize the Party in order to achieve this goal; the subsequent forced counterattack against the Rightists was still to protect and develop the broad masses' criticism of the Party, so that the Party could achieve the goal of rectifying its work style and improving its work.

Comrade Tao Zhu said that in overcoming subjectivism in the rectification and reform work of the Party's leading organs and leading cadres in Guangdong, the current emphasis should be on overcoming Right-leaning and conservative thinking. The Second Five-Year Plan is about to begin, and we want to organize a vigorous production upsurge. This upsurge should be no less than that of the end of 1955. However, many of our leading organs and leading cadres are always shouting about difficulties and lack sufficient energy. Tao Zhu said, "I always feel that many of our cadres and leading organs lack a resolute spirit of hard work." Hard work is what we often call revolutionary spirit, or revolutionary enthusiasm. We Communists rely on this spirit of hard work to carry out revolution and construction. Hard work is subjective, and it is dangerous to be divorced from reality and the masses, but if it is combined with the masses and reality, it will become a huge material force. The production upsurge we organized at the end of 1955 can vividly prove this point. Now, the Central Committee and the broad masses are eagerly demanding that we organize this upsurge, but some of our leading organs and leading cadres underestimate the enthusiasm of the masses and underestimate the Party's leadership, and therefore lack confidence in this movement. To rectify subjectivism, we should start with this issue.

Comrade Tao Zhu said that in combating bureaucracy, we should currently focus on streamlining institutions. We should learn from the revolutionary spirit of Beijing and vigorously streamline institutions. Some unreasonable systems in the leading organs have been abolished or improved, but not thoroughly enough, and there are areas of formalism. These aspects also need to be reformed. To combat sectarianism, we should first focus on a major debate on the historical issues of Guangdong. He said that the vast majority of Party member cadres in Guangdong Province, regardless of whether they are from elsewhere or local, have demonstrated a communist spirit in handling the relationship between the two, and the relationship is normal and harmonious. However, in the past year or two, a kind of sectarianism with localism as its content has grown among a very small number of Party member cadres. Sectarianism is incompatible with communism. In this rectification and reform, we should distinguish right from wrong and resolve the issue through a major debate on historical issues.

Regarding the method of rectification and reform, Comrade Tao Zhu said that in the rectification and reform stage, we should continue to boldly encourage the masses to express their opinions and let the masses express their opinions on the leading organs and leading cadres. When formulating plans to correct shortcomings and improve work, or when starting to solve problems, we should involve the masses as much as possible, and constantly solicit their opinions and solve problems with them.

At the beginning and end of the meeting of Party member cadres above the level of department and bureau chiefs convened by the Provincial Party Committee, Comrade Tao Zhu repeatedly emphasized that Guangdong Province has its own characteristics when the rectification movement transitions to the stage focusing on rectification and reform. This characteristic is that Guangdong Province is transitioning to rectification and reform under the circumstances that the counterattack against the Rightists was not thorough, most of the Rightists have not been defeated, and a small number of Rightists have not been exposed. The major debate on the historical issues of Guangdong has also just begun. Thus, a problem arises in the rectification and reform stage: diverse content and heavy tasks. Comrade Tao Zhu said that the Provincial Party Committee has fully considered this issue. As long as the Party's leading organs and leading cadres are clear-headed and do not ignore this important characteristic, and as long as they fully mobilize the masses and rely on the masses, the problem will definitely be solved.

Comrade Tao Zhu said that we can also think of some solutions organizationally. First, we should transfer in batches; second, we should focus on key points in rectification and reform; and third, we should extend the time for the rectification and reform stage. Transferring in batches means that the rectification movement of most units in the province can transition to the stage mainly focusing on rectification and reform, but some units need to act according to their specific circumstances and should not force the transition. For example, if some units have not formed a movement to counterattack the Rightists at all, most of the Rightists have not been defeated, and the major debate on the historical issues of Guangdong is in full swing, then they should continue to concentrate their main force on fighting the Rightists and doing a good job in the historical debate, and gradually transition to the stage mainly focusing on rectification and reform. In short, we must act according to the situation, transfer well, transfer seriously, and not transfer carelessly. Focusing on the key points of rectification and reform means not putting all rectification and reform issues on the agenda at once, but first concentrating efforts on solving the most important issues, rectifying and reforming thoroughly, and also freeing up appropriate time to continue to deepen the counterattack against the Rightists and do a good job in the historical debate. During the rectification and reform stage of the rectification movement in Guangdong Province, it is necessary to solve three tasks simultaneously: rectification and reform, continued in-depth counterattack against the Rightists, and the major debate on historical issues. All three tasks should be carried out thoroughly, so it is impossible to act hastily. Comrade Tao Zhu said that the Provincial Party Committee's opinion is to extend the time for the rectification and reform stage to half a year, from now until May 1st Labor Day next year.

### 广东省在转入整改阶段中强调提出  组织生产高潮要有一股干劲

    广东省在转入整改阶段中强调提出
    组织生产高潮要有一股干劲
    本报特约新华社广州26日电　中共广东省委24日晚召开厅、局长以上党员干部会议，省委第一书记陶铸代表省委在会上宣布：广东省的整风运动，由反击右派阶段转入着重整改的阶段。
    陶铸同志说，整顿党的领导机关和领导干部的作风，改进党的领导机关和领导干部的工作，本来就是我们党发动整风的根本目的。党号召党内外群众大鸣大放批评党，是为了达到这个目的；以后被迫反击右派，仍然是为了保护和发展广大群众对党的批评，使党达到整顿作风和改进工作的目的。
    陶铸同志说，广东地区党的领导机关和领导干部的整改工作，在克服主观主义时，当前应该突出地克服右倾和保守思想。第二个五年计划马上要开始了，我们想组织一个轰轰烈烈的生产高潮。这个高潮应该不要亚于1955年底那样。但是我们不少领导机关和领导干部，却总是叫喊困难，劲头不足。陶铸说，我总觉得我们不少干部和领导机关缺少一股坚毅的干劲。干劲就是我们常说的革命精神，或者叫做革命积极性。我们共产党人干革命闹建设全靠这股子干劲。干劲是主观的，离开实际离开群众是危险的，但如果和群众和实际相结合，便会变成一股巨大的物质力量。1955年底我们组织的生产高潮就能生动的证明这个道理。现在，中央和广大群众都迫切地要求我们组织这个高潮，只是我们一些领导机关和领导干部，低估了群众的积极性，低估了党的领导力量，才对这个运动信心不足。要整主观主义，先该从这个问题整起。
    陶铸同志说，在反官僚主义方面，当前我们应该抓住紧缩机构这一条。学习北京的革命精神，大力紧缩机构。领导机关的一些不合理制度，有的我们已经取消了，有的改进了，但不够彻底，有形式主义的地方。这方面也要改。反宗派主义应该先抓广东历史问题大辩论。他说，广东省的绝大多数党员干部，不管外来的，不管本地的，在处理两者间的关系时，表现了共产主义精神，关系是正常的，融洽的。但是，近一、二年来，在党内极少数党员干部中，却滋长了一种以地方主义为内容的宗派主义。宗派主义和共产主义不相容。在这次整改中，应该通过历史问题大辩论，分清是非，把问题解决。
    关于整改的方法，陶铸同志说，在整改阶段中，应该继续放手地大鸣大放，让群众把对领导机关领导干部的意见都说出来。拟订纠正缺点改进工作的方案，或着手解决问题时，要多吸收群众参加，并要时时征求群众意见，和群众一道去解决。
    省委召集的厅局长以上党员干部会的会末和会初，陶铸同志反复地强调了广东省整风运动转入着重整改阶段的时候，有着自己的特点。这个特点是，广东省是在反击右派搞得很不彻底的情况下转入整改的，多数右派分子还没有斗垮，少数右派分子还没有揭露出来。广东历史问题大辩论也还是刚刚开始。这样，就发生了一个整改阶段内内容多样，任务繁重的问题。陶铸同志说，省委已经充分地考虑了这个问题。只要党的领导机关和领导干部头脑清醒，不要忽略这个重要特点，只要充分发动群众依靠群众，问题是一定会解决好的。
    陶铸同志说，还可以从组织上想些办法，一要分批转，二要整改抓重点，三要延长整改阶段时间。分批转是指省的多数单位整风运动可以转入整改为主阶段，但是某些单位则需要根据自己的具体情况行事，不要勉强转。譬如有些单位反击右派分子根本未形成运动，多数右派分子并未斗垮，广东历史问题大辩论正在火头上，那么，它们仍应继续集中主力斗争右派和搞好历史大辩论，逐步转到以整改为主的阶段。总之要看情况办事，要转好，认真的转，不要马虎的转。抓整改重点是指不要将整改问题一下都排到议程上来，先集中力量解决最重要的问题，整改得彻底些，又能适当腾出时间，继续深入反击右派和搞好历史大辩论。在广东省整风的整改阶段内，要同时解决整改、继续深入反击右派、历史问题大辩论这三个任务，三个任务又都力求彻底，因此，仓促行事是不成的。陶铸同志说，省委意见是把整改阶段的时间延长到半年，从现在起到明年“五一”劳动节时结束。
