Xinhua News Agency, 29th. After the Ministry of Public Security entered the third stage of the rectification campaign, the leadership took many measures to encourage and support the masses to speak out. Within a week, a high tide of big blooming and contending emerged in the ministry, with 1,300 big-character posters put up, raising many opinions to the leadership of the Ministry of Public Security.

The Ministry of Public Security comprehensively entered the third stage of the rectification campaign on October 21. The Party leadership group of the Ministry of Public Security has held three meetings to discuss the leadership of the masses in speaking out and improving work. In order to strengthen leadership, the Party leadership group appointed two vice ministers to be specifically responsible for the rectification work and required them to report the situation to the Party leadership group every day or every other day. At each meeting, the Party leadership group emphasized that leading cadres should not be afraid of "getting burned," but should be determined to burn away the problems in their leadership work, trust the majority of the masses, repeatedly mobilize them, eliminate any concerns, and be sure to do more for the masses. The opinions raised by the masses must be studied and dealt with in a timely manner, ensuring that every item is accounted for.

After entering the third stage of the rectification campaign, the Ministry of Public Security strengthened the forces of the ministry's rectification leadership group. This group is divided into five subgroups: staffing, cadre work, welfare, business policy, etc. The rectification leadership group meets every afternoon to study the entire rectification situation, pay attention to the development of the movement, and promptly urge various units to strengthen the rectification work. Each unit under the Ministry of Public Security also has a main responsible cadre leading the rectification work. The rectification leadership groups or rectification groups of various units study and deal with the opinions raised by the masses item by item every day, and announce the handling situation on time on the same day or every other day. These measures have encouraged the masses to speak out freely.

In the past week, all units have conscientiously implemented the policy of rectifying while correcting, and resolutely corrected what can be corrected. After a big-character poster exposed that a leading cadre of a division used welfare funds to buy high-end consumer goods, the ministry's rectification leadership group immediately notified the relevant unit to have him return the welfare funds. A big-character poster criticized a deputy section chief for not obeying the organization's assignment for a long time in the past. Now the deputy section chief expressed sincere acceptance of the criticism and said that he would resolutely obey the assignment in the future. At present, all units attach great importance to the opinions raised by the masses on improving the leadership style. Some people posted big-character posters criticizing "Why doesn't the bureau chief attend the division affairs meeting?" and some criticized some bureau-level responsible cadres for not going deep into the inspection work. These criticisms of bureaucracy have attracted the attention of leading cadres, and many people have expressed their acceptance of the criticism, and the leadership style has begun to undergo new changes. At present, the rectification leadership group of the Ministry of Public Security is drafting a plan to improve the leadership style and closely connect with the masses. This plan will be submitted to the masses for discussion.

    领导整改决心大　群众鸣放热情高
    公安部逐条研究群众意见按时公布处理情况
    新华社29日讯　公安部转入整风第三阶段以后，领导方面采取了很多措施来鼓励和支持群众鸣放，在一星期之内，这个部的大鸣大放已形成热潮，贴出了一千三百多张大字报，给公安部领导方面提出了很多意见。
    公安部在10月21日全面转入整风第三阶段，公安部党组已开过三次会议，讨论了领导群众鸣放和改进工作的问题。为了加强领导，党组指定两位副部长专门负责整改工作，并要他们每天或隔一天向党组汇报一次情况。党组在每次会上都强调领导干部不要害怕“引火烧身”，要有决心烧掉领导工作中的毛病，要相信群众的多数，要反复动员，解除任何顾虑，一定要多为群众办事，对群众提出的意见，必须及时研究和处理，保证作到件件有交代。
    公安部转入整风第三阶段后，即加强了部的整改领导小组的力量。这个小组下分编制、干部工作、生活福利、业务方针政策等五个小组。整改领导小组每天下午开会，研究全部的整改情况，注意运动的发展，并且及时督促各单位加强整改工作。公安部所属各单位也都有一位主要负责干部领导整改工作。各单位整风领导小组或整改小组每天逐条研究和处理群众提出的意见，并且在当天或隔一天按时公布一次处理情况。这些措施都鼓舞了群众的大鸣大放。
    这一星期内，各单位认真执行了边整边改的方针，可以改的坚决地改正。大字报揭露一位处的领导干部用福利费去买高级生活用品一事后，部的整改领导小组即通知有关单位要他退回福利费。大字报批评一位副科长过去长期不服从组织分配，现在这位副科长表示诚恳接受批评，以后要坚决服从分配。目前各单位很重视群众提出的关于改进领导作风的意见。有的人贴大字报批评有些“局长为什么不参加处务会议”，有的批评一些局级负责干部不深入检查工作。这些对官僚主义作风的批评，引起了领导干部的注意，许多人都表示接受批评，领导作风开始有了新的转变。现在，公安部整改领导小组正在拟定改进领导作风、密切联系群众的方案。这个方案将交给群众讨论。
