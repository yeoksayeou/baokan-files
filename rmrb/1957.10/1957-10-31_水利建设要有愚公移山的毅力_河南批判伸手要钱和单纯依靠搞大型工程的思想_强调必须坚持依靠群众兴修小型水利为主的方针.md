This newspaper's Zhengzhou, 30th dispatch: The Henan Daily editorial department reported: Henan Province has decided to launch a large-scale farmland water conservancy construction movement in 1958 to develop agricultural production. It is required that on the basis of the province's existing 43 million mu of irrigated land, the irrigation area be expanded by another 20 million mu; to reduce waterlogging disasters by 10 million mu in the event of a single rainfall of 150 mm; and to increase soil and water conservation area by 6,800 square kilometers. At the same time, it is required that farmland water conservancy construction be closely integrated with current agricultural production, that winter and spring irrigation work be done well, and that a high tide of fertilizer accumulation, mainly pig raising and fertilizer accumulation, be launched, striving to achieve a total grain output of 28.5 billion jin in the province in 1958 (an increase of 15% over this year), a wheat output of 9 billion jin (an increase of 20% over this year), and a cotton output of 400 million jin (an increase of 15% over this year). The content of this decision was researched and decided upon by the commissioners of each special zone, the heads of key counties, and the directors of water conservancy bureaus at the Henan Provincial People's Committee's water conservancy work conference.

    Tan Zhenlin, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, attended the Henan Provincial Water Conservancy Work Conference and gave important instructions to the conference on the 26th.

    The Henan Provincial Water Conservancy Work Conference was held on the basis of the province's great achievements in farmland water conservancy construction and the brilliant victory in drought-resistant wheat planting. After liberation, in the seven years from 1949 to October 1955, the province's irrigated area expanded by a total of 7.5 million mu, exceeding the total of 7.2 million mu developed in Henan's thousands of years of water conservancy history; starting in October 1955, under the promotion of the high tide of agricultural cooperativization, a high tide of water conservancy construction appeared in the province. By May 1956, the province had developed an irrigation area of 24 million mu in these seven months, equivalent to more than three times the irrigated area increased in the seven years after liberation; in the year from the winter of 1956 to September of this year, the province developed another 5 million mu of irrigated land. Although the speed was slower than the high tide period of water conservancy construction from the winter of 1955 to the spring of 1956, it still exceeded the speed before agricultural cooperativization in the province; recently, in the drought-resistant wheat planting campaign, 15 million organized farmers built water conservancy projects with the spirit of moving mountains and overturning seas, expanding the irrigation area by 6.1 million mu in one month. These water conservancy facilities have already played a role in agricultural production. The Mang River used to be the most harmful river in Jiyuan County. The maximum flow of this river was 1,000, and only 100 were discharged. According to the usual method of river management, large reservoirs would be built and the river would be dredged. However, they adopted dozens of methods such as building small reservoirs, closing mountains for afforestation, and building dry wells to control the river's flood. This year, Jiyuan County had 560 mm of rain. The Mang River should generally have more than 500 flows, but only 70 flows appeared, reducing the flood flow by six-sevenths. The Wangwu Mountain mentioned in the story of "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains" is located here. The Wangwu Agricultural Cooperative on the mountain built five small reservoirs, hundreds of water cellars and other water conservancy projects within one year, and this year the yield per mu reached 2,000 jin. The example of Jiyuan County has created a model for the centralized management of small rivers and the development of mountain production, which has attracted the attention of the conference. The conference affirmed and summarized these achievements, especially the achievements of the large-scale farmland water conservancy construction from the winter of 1955 to the spring of 1956, believing that this was a miracle in the history of water conservancy development in Henan Province. It was not rash advance, but a great leap forward, and it was wrong to doubt and ignore this achievement.

    The people of Henan Province have accumulated rich experience in farmland water conservancy construction. In accordance with the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the conference summarized the experience in this area, and based on this experience and the natural characteristics of concentrated rainfall and uneven drought and flood in Henan Province, determined that the future policy of farmland water conservancy construction should be overall planning and comprehensive management. These experiences are mainly: First, the leadership must have determination in water conservancy construction, have a tenacious fighting will and the spirit of the Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains, and be able to withstand success and also withstand the test of failure. It is necessary to have a long-term view of water management and a long-term fundamental plan. It is impossible to treat the head when it hurts and the foot when it hurts. It is necessary to arrange the development of irrigation, flood control, flood prevention, and soil and water conservation in a comprehensive manner and combine them. It is necessary to have the purpose of both eliminating harm and promoting benefit. Manpower, materials, and financial resources must be comprehensively planned and arranged. There must be a strong working body, and each level must have someone in charge. It is necessary to carry out water conservancy construction throughout the year, to work hard during the slack season, to work less during the busy season, and to carry out large-scale mass movements in the winter and spring seasons. Second, according to the natural conditions, it is necessary to adhere to the principle of storing water as the main focus, draining water as the auxiliary focus, and combining storage and drainage in water management. The natural conditions in Henan Province are: concentrated rainfall during the flood season, frequent floods in summer and autumn, frequent droughts in winter and spring, and it is located in the upper reaches of the five major water systems. This natural situation determines that the problem of water and drought disasters cannot be solved by relying on drainage or water storage alone, let alone by adopting a method that focuses on drainage. Therefore, within a watershed area, whether it is the upstream, midstream, or downstream, a method that focuses on water storage and uses drainage as a supplement should be adopted. It is necessary to combine flood control and river regulation, and combine drought prevention and flood prevention, otherwise water and drought disasters cannot be solved. Third, in water management, it is necessary to rely on the masses, with small-scale projects as the main focus, medium-sized projects as the auxiliary focus, and a combination of large, medium, and small projects. Taking small-scale projects as the main focus can become a mass water conservancy construction movement. Forming a mass water management movement can eradicate water and drought disasters. Taking small-scale projects as the main focus can rely on the masses. Fourth, in solving the problem of waterlogging, it is necessary to combine flood avoidance, flood prevention, and flood removal, and combine changing crop types, improving farming methods, and changing topography. It is impossible to blindly block drainage, let alone harm neighbors. In areas prone to waterlogging, the first thing to do is to ensure a good harvest, and then gradually achieve high yields on the basis of ensuring a good harvest. Fifth, the main way to solve drought and promote continuous agricultural production is to develop irrigation and turn dry land into irrigated land. In terms of methods, it is necessary to adapt to local conditions and combine the use of groundwater and surface water, neither of which can be neglected. Only by combining the use of groundwater and surface water can the combined effect of flood prevention, flood control, and drought prevention be achieved, and the goal of comprehensive utilization can be achieved. Sixth, doing a good job in soil and water conservation is the fundamental measure for mountain production. It is necessary to implement the policy of overall planning, comprehensive development, combined slope and gully management, and centralized management. In terms of measures, agriculture, forestry, water, and animal husbandry must be closely integrated. Because surface erosion is the root cause of soil erosion, it is necessary to focus on slope management in combination with gully management. Agricultural cultivation techniques should be carried out on the slopes to bury as much water and soil as possible in the farmland. This is in line with natural laws and can significantly increase agricultural production. It is an effective method to closely integrate the current interests of the masses. In slope and gully management, it should start from production, combine the current interests of the masses, and adopt comprehensive measures focusing on the development of agricultural production, with the principle of using annual income to support long-term income. Only in this way can we improve the enthusiasm of the mountainous masses to carry out soil and water conservation work. Seventh, in areas with sandy and alkaline wasteland, it is necessary to develop water fields based on water conservancy conditions, change to planting rice, turn sandy and alkaline wasteland into paddy fields, and at the same time plant trees to create forests, prevent wind and fix sand, reverse the land and deposit sand, and divert yellow water to deposit silt, turning wasteland into fertile land.

    By affirming achievements and summarizing experience, the conference clarified the policy of relying on the masses to build farmland water conservancy projects mainly of small scale. At the beginning, most of the comrades from the special and county levels who came to the meeting asked for money and cadres, and held the idea of ​​simply relying on large-scale projects. After discussion, this idea was criticized. The Xinxiang Special Zone plans to divert water from the Yellow River to open up waterway areas in Yanjin, Fengqiu, and Yuanyang counties, and intends to ask the state to invest 8 million yuan. Later, it was changed to allow the masses to contribute voluntary labor and materials, and only 500,000 yuan of state investment would be needed. Xiuwu County in this special zone prepared to build Zifanggou, planning to irrigate 30,000 to 40,000 mu of land. Deputy County Chief Zhao Zunsong repeatedly asked the leading organs for money and cadres. This time he said at the meeting that he could build it without money. He said: We must face the masses. Relying on the masses, do the masses have money? At the meeting, many comrades used many facts to show that the masses have money. County Chief Wang Jingzhou of Anyang County calculated that Anyang County had a bumper cotton harvest, and farmers earned more than 30 million yuan from selling cotton alone. Due to the criticism of right-leaning thoughts and the establishment of the viewpoint of relying on the masses to build small-scale farmland water conservancy projects, the province originally planned to expand the irrigation area by 10 million mu next year, but now it has been increased to 20 million mu. Comrades from Luoyang Special Zone used to think that Luoyang area was a mountainous area with poor water conservancy conditions, and only planned to expand the irrigation area by 600,000 mu next year, but now it has been increased to 900,000 mu. After discussion at the meeting, everyone believed that as long as they rely on the masses and have the energy to persevere, the large-scale farmland water conservancy movement in the coming winter and spring will surely set off a new upsurge on the basis of the water conservancy construction movement that has already formed during the drought-resistant wheat planting period.

    The Henan Provincial Water Conservancy Work Conference was held from the 21st to the 27th.

    水利建设要有愚公移山的毅力
    河南批判伸手要钱和单纯依靠搞大型工程的思想
    强调必须坚持依靠群众兴修小型水利为主的方针
    本报郑州30日电　河南日报编辑部报道：河南省决定在1958年开展一个发展农业生产的大规模的农田水利建设运动。要求在全省原有水浇地四千三百多万亩的基础上，再扩大灌溉面积二千万亩；在一次降雨一百五十公厘的情况下减除涝灾一千万亩；增加水土保持面积六千八百平方公里。同时要求农田水利建设要和当前的农业生产紧密结合起来，做好冬浇春浇工作，并掀起一个以养猪积肥为主的积肥高潮，争取全省在1958年内，粮食产量达到二百八十五亿斤（比今年增产15％），小麦产量达到九十亿斤（比今年增产二成），棉花产量达到四亿斤（比今年增产15％）。这个决定内容是河南省各专区专员、重点县县长和水利局长在河南省人民委员会召开的水利工作会议上研究决定的。
    中共中央书记处书记谭震林同志参加了河南省举行的水利工作会议，并在26日向大会作了重要指示。
    河南省水利工作会议是在全省农田水利建设工作取得巨大成绩和抗旱种麦取得辉煌胜利的基础上召开的。解放后，从1949年到1955年10月的七年中，全省的水浇地面积共扩大七百五十万亩，超过河南省历史上几千年发展水利七百二十万亩的总和；1955年10月开始，在农业合作化高潮的推动下，全省出现了水利建设高潮，到1956年5月，全省在这七个月内发展水浇地面积二千四百万亩，相当于解放后七年内增加的水浇地面积的三倍多；1956年冬到今年9月这一年内，全省又发展了水浇地五百万亩，速度虽然比1955年冬到1956年春水利建设高潮时期减少了，但是仍然超过全省农业合作化以前的速度；最近在抗旱种麦运动中，一千五百万有组织的农民以移山倒海的气派兴修水利，一个月时间扩大灌溉面积六百一十万亩。这些水利设备在农业生产上已经发挥了作用。漭河原是济源县危害最严重的河流。这个河道的最高流量是一千个，下泄只有一百个，按平常治河办法是修大水库、挖河，可是他们却采取了修小水库、封山育林、修旱井等几十种办法把这条河的洪水治住了。今年济源县下了五百六十公厘的雨，漭河一般应有五百多个流量，却只出现七十多个流量，缩减洪水流量七分之六。“愚公移山”故事中所说的王屋山就在这里。山上王屋农业社一年内修五个小水库，几百个水窖和其他水利工程，今年亩产量达到二千斤。济源县的事例给集中治理小型河流、发展山区生产创造了典范，引起了大会的重视。会议肯定、总结了这些成绩，特别是1955年冬到1956年春大兴农田水利的成绩，认为这是河南省水利发展历史上的奇迹。不是冒进，而是跃进，怀疑与忽视这一成绩是错误的。
    河南省人民在农田水利建设上积累了丰富的经验。会议根据中共八届三中全会精神，总结了这方面的经验，并根据这些经验和河南省雨量集中、旱涝不均的自然特点，确定今后农田水利建设的方针是全面规划，综合治理。这些经验主要是：第一、领导对水利建设必须有决心，要有顽强的斗争意志和愚公移山的劲头，经得起成功，也要经得起失败的考验。要有长期的治水观点，要有长远的根本打算。不能头痛医头，脚痛医脚。要把发展灌溉、除涝、防洪、水土保持，全面安排，结合进行。要有既除害又兴利的目的。人力、物力、财力，都要有全面规划、全面安排。要有强有力的办事机构，各级要有专人负责。要把水利建设贯穿全年，农闲大干，农忙小干，冬春季节采取大规模的群众运动的形式突击进行。第二、根据自然情况，在治水上必须坚持以蓄为主、以排为辅、蓄泄兼施的方针。河南省的自然情况是：汛期雨量集中，夏秋多涝、冬春多旱，且又处五大水系的上游。这一自然情况，决定了在解决水旱灾害问题上不能只靠排水或蓄水一个办法解决，更不能采取以排水为主的方法。因此，在一个流域面积内，不论是上游、中游、下游都应采取以蓄为主、以排为辅的方法。要把拦蓄洪水和河道整理结合起来，把防旱和防涝结合起来，否则就不能解决水旱灾害。第三、在治水上，必须是依靠群众，以小型为主，中型为辅，大中小工程相结合。以小型为主，才能成为群众性的水利建设运动。形成群众性的治水运动，才能根除水旱灾害。以小型为主，才能够依靠群众。第四、在解决涝灾问题上，必须把避涝、防涝和除涝结合起来，把改种作物、改进耕作方法和改变地形结合起来，不能盲目排堵，更不能以邻为壑。在易遭涝灾的地区首先应做到保收，在保收的基础上，再逐步实现高产。第五、解决旱灾，促进农业不断增产，主要办法是发展灌溉，变旱地为水浇地。在方法上，必须是因地制宜，要把利用地下水和利用地上水结合起来，二者不可偏废。只有把利用地下水和利用地上水结合起来，才能起到防洪、防涝、防旱结合的作用，达到综合利用的目的。第六、做好水土保持是山区生产的根本措施，必须贯彻全面规划、综合开发、坡沟兼治、集中治理的方针。在措施上，必须是农林水牧密切结合。因为面蚀是水土流失的根源，因此必须以治坡为主，结合治沟。在坡面上进行农业耕作技术措施，把水土尽量埋蓄在农田里。这样既合乎自然规律，又能显著增加农业生产，是密切结合群众当前利益的有效办法。在坡沟治理上，应从生产出发，结合群众当前利益，采取以发展农业生产为主的综合措施，以当年生利养长年生利为原则。只有这样才能提高山区群众开展水土保持工作的积极性。第七、在有砂碱荒地区，必须是根据水利条件发展水地，改种水稻，变砂碱荒地为水田，同时要植树造林，防风固砂，反地倒砂，引黄放淤，变荒地为良田。
    通过肯定成绩，总结经验，会议明确了依靠群众兴修以小型为主的农田水利工作方针。开始，各专、县来参加会议的同志，大多伸手要钱、要干部，存有单纯依靠搞大型工程的思想。经过讨论，批判了这种思想。新乡专区计划引黄河水在延津、封丘、原阳县开辟水道区，打算要求国家投资八百万元。后来改为让群众出义务工，群众出材料的办法，只要国家投资五十万元就行了。这个专区的修武县准备修建子房沟，计划浇三、四万亩土地，副县长赵遵松再三向领导机关提出要钱、要干部，这次他在会议上表示，不给钱也能修。他说：我们要面向群众。靠群众，群众有没有钱呢？会议上许多同志以很多事实说明群众是有钱的。安阳县长王景周算账说：安阳县棉花丰收，农民仅卖棉花就收入三千余万元。由于批判了右倾思想，树立了依靠群众兴修小型农田水利的观点，全省原计划明年扩大灌溉面积一千万亩，现在提高为二千万亩。洛阳专区的同志过去认为洛阳地区是个山区，水利条件差，明年只打算扩大灌溉面积六十万亩，现在提高到九十万亩。会议讨论结果，大家认为，只要依靠群众，有股劲坚持不懈，今冬明春的大规模兴修农田水利运动必将在抗旱种麦期间已经形成的水利建设运动的基础上掀起新的高潮。
    河南省水利工作会议是在21日到27日举行的。
