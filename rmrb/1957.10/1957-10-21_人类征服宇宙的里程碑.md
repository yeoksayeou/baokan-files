    A Milestone in Mankind's Conquest of the Universe
    Dai Wensai, Deputy Director of the Department of Mathematics and Astronomy, Nanjing University

    The successful launch of the first artificial satellite by the Soviet Union is an event of great political and scientific significance. The manufacture and launch of artificial satellites is a very complex and comprehensive scientific undertaking, involving rocket technology, metallurgy, machinery, astronomy, mathematics, physics, chemistry, meteorology, geophysics, geodesy, and radio electronics. Two years ago, both the Soviet Union and the United States announced that they would launch artificial satellites during the Third International Geophysical Year. The result is that the Soviet Union succeeded first, and the artificial satellite launched is larger and heavier than the one the United States was preparing to launch, by more than eight times. This shows that the Soviet Union has surpassed the United States in science and technology. The completion of the first atomic power station in the Soviet Union three years ago shows that socialist Soviet Union is the most concerned in the world with applying scientific and technological achievements to improving the material life of the people. Now, the Soviet Union is leading the way again in the peaceful use of rockets. People all over the world are rejoicing over the glorious achievements made by the Soviet Union in this epoch-making initiative of artificial satellites. People all over the world recognize from this event that the socialist camp is strong and getting stronger day by day. The successful launch of artificial satellites also vividly and concretely illustrates the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system. Only by fully exploiting the characteristics of socialism, the planning and collectivity of work, can such a complex and comprehensive task be completed so quickly.

    From a scientific point of view, the successful launch of the Soviet artificial satellite is the first step for mankind to conquer outer space and a milestone in mankind's struggle against nature. It has opened up a new way to solve a series of difficult scientific problems. In terms of astrophysics, artificial satellites can play a very important role.

    First, it can be used to study meteors. Meteors are small objects in the solar system that orbit the sun like the earth, and their number is extremely large, with tens of thousands falling into the Earth's atmosphere every day. Understanding the relationship between small objects and large objects is a way to solve the problem of the origin and evolution of celestial bodies. In order to further conquer outer space, the study of meteors is also urgently needed. The Soviet Union's first artificial Earth satellite was equipped with instruments to study meteors.

    The atmosphere surrounding the Earth is like the clothes we wear, protecting the people who live on the ground. It slows down meteors that hit the Earth and burns up smaller meteors inside it. Ozone in the atmosphere (distributed at altitudes of tens of kilometers) absorbs most of the ultraviolet light from the sun, preventing it from burning our skin. The atmosphere also plays a role in regulating temperature, so that the temperature difference between day and night is not too great. But on the other hand, the Earth's atmosphere hinders our exploration of the universe in several ways. The ultraviolet light of the sun and other stars can provide us with valuable information about the structure of celestial bodies and the physical conditions on celestial bodies. Due to the absorption of the atmosphere, we have not been able to obtain this information on the ground. Clouds and fog formed in the atmosphere also hinder our observation of celestial bodies. Even without clouds and fog, there are often various flows in the atmosphere, which produce the twinkling phenomenon of stars that ordinary people often see, and also produce the so-called atmospheric dispersion phenomenon. These phenomena are obstacles to our precise observation of celestial bodies. Artificial satellites can carry instruments to measure the intensity of solar ultraviolet light and spectrographic instruments to photograph the short ultraviolet region of the sun to conduct observations at high altitudes without ozone. In the future, after large artificial satellites are built successfully, observatories can be set up inside them. In such observatories thousands or tens of thousands of miles above the ground, celestial bodies can be observed 24 hours a day, without being affected by weather changes, the stars do not twinkle, and the daytime sky is also dark (because there is no air to scatter sunlight), and you can often see the stars in the sky. In such an observatory, observing the moon and planets, the magnification of the telescope can be as large as possible, unlike on the ground where it is limited to less than a thousand times. After the completion of such an observatory, the study of celestial bodies and the study of the universe will make leapfrog progress.

    Now that artificial satellites have been successfully built, no one will doubt the possibility of further launching rockets to the moon and Mars. The realization of interstellar travel will enable us to further grasp the laws of material movement in the universe. Therefore, it is no exaggeration to say that the successful launch of artificial satellites has opened a new era for mankind to conquer nature.

    It was originally estimated that artificial satellites could only be seen with the naked eye at dusk or dawn. But for a week, people in Beijing and Nanjing in China, Kazakhstan in the Soviet Union, and the United States have seen artificial satellites at night. Artificial satellites are only a few hundred kilometers away from the ground, unlike the moon, which is 380,000 kilometers away from the ground. The sunlight should be blocked by the Earth at night and not reach the artificial satellite. This first artificial satellite does not seem to have lighting equipment (Soviet documents mentioned that some artificial satellites will be equipped with intermittent gas lights), and if it did, the Soviet bulletin would definitely mention it. The fact that many places saw artificial satellites at night is most likely because the third stage rocket carrying the satellite and the conical protective cover have become meteors, and they generate heat and emit light by rubbing against the air. Because the speed is slower than ordinary meteors (11 to 78 kilometers per second), and the air in the orbit is thinner, it is not as bright as ordinary meteors.

    We can call the vertical projection line of the artificial satellite orbit on the ground the projection line for short. Due to the Earth's rotation, the projection line is moving westward. The news released by the Soviet Union every day only mentions the time when artificial satellites are seen in or near major cities in China on the projection line. Within China, the adjacent two projection lines are about 2,000 kilometers apart. Artificial satellites can still be seen within 1,000 kilometers on both sides of the projection line. The farther away from the projection line, the closer the satellite is to the eastern or western horizon. In this way, almost all areas of China can currently see artificial satellites at least once every night, and areas located in the middle of the two projection lines can see them twice. Many people may have drawn the wrong conclusion from the times published in the newspaper, thinking that only a few large cities such as Beijing, Guangzhou, and Chengdu can see them. A few days ago there was moonlight, so only people with very good eyesight could see the artificial satellite (actually it may have been the rocket that had become a meteor). It will be easier to see when there is no moonlight in the future. This is my personal opinion.

    人类征服宇宙的里程碑
    南京大学数学天文系副主任  戴文赛
    苏联成功地发射了第一个人造卫星，这是一件具有重大政治意义和科学意义的事情。人造卫星的制造和发射是一件很复杂的综合性的科学工作，牵涉到火箭技术、冶金、机械、天文、数学、物理、化学、气象、地球物理、大地测量、无线电电子学等方面。两年前苏联和美国都宣布要在第三届国际地球物理年期间发射出人造卫星。结果是苏联先做成功，而且所射出的人造卫星比美国所准备射出的大，重量也大到八倍以上。这表示苏联在科学技术方面已经走在美国前面了。三年前苏联第一个原子能发电站的建成说明了社会主义的苏联是世界上最关心于把科学技术成就应用在人民物质生活的改善。现在，在和平利用火箭上，苏联又领先了。全世界人民都为苏联在人造卫星这划时代的创举上所获得的辉煌成就而欢欣鼓舞。全世界人民都从这件事认识到社会主义阵营是强大的，而且一天比一天更强大。人造卫星发射成功也生动具体地说明了社会主义制度的无比的优越性。只有充分发挥社会主义的特点，工作的计划性和集体性，才能这样快地把一件极复杂的综合性工作完成。
    从科学上说来，苏联人造卫星的发射成功是人类征服宇宙空间的第一步，是人类同自然斗争中的一个里程碑。它为解决一系列困难的科学问题开辟了一条新的途径。以天体物理学来说，人造卫星就可以起很重要的作用。
    首先可以利用它来研究流星。流星是太阳系里和地球一样地绕着太阳运转的小物体，数目极大，每天落入地球大气的即以万计。了解小物体和大物体的关系，是解决天体的起源演化问题的一条途径。为了进一步征服宇宙空间，流星的研究也是迫切需要的。苏联的第一个人造地球卫星就装有研究流星的仪器。
    包围着地球的大气，好比穿在人身上的衣服一样，对居住在地面上的人们起了保护的作用。它使撞到地球上的流星降低速度，使较小的流星在它里头烧毁。大气里的臭氧（分布在数十公里高空里）把从太阳射来的紫外光大部分都吸收了，使这种光线不致于烧伤我们的皮肤。大气也起调节温度的作用，使白天和黑夜的温度差别不致太大。但另一方面，地球大气对我们探索宇宙在几个方面起了阻碍作用。太阳和其他星球的紫外光可以供给我们关于天体的结构和天体上的物理情况的宝贵资料。由于大气的吸收，我们在地面上未能获得这种资料。在大气内形成的云和雾也阻碍我们对天体的观测。即使没有云雾，大气内也常有各种流动，这种流动产生了一般人经常看到的星星闪烁现象，也产生所谓大气色散现象。这些现象都是我们精密观测天体的障碍。人造卫星可以携带测量太阳紫外光强度的仪器和拍摄太阳短紫外区光谱的分光仪器到没有臭氧的高空进行观测。将来造成功大的人造卫星之后，可以把天文台设在里面。在这种千里或万里高空的观象台里，一天二十四小时都可以观测天体，不会受到天气变化的影响，星星不闪烁了，白昼天空也是暗的（因为没有空气来散射太阳光），经常可以看到满天的繁星。在这种天文台里观测月亮和行星，望远镜的放大倍数可以尽量大，不像在地面上限于一千倍以下。这样的天文台建成以后，天体的研究和宇宙的研究将获得飞跃的进展。
    人造卫星造成功了，现在不会再有人怀疑进一步把火箭射到月亮上火星上的可能性了。星际航行的实现将使我们更进一步地掌握宇宙间物质运动的规律。所以说人造卫星的发射成功给人类征服自然开辟了新纪元，这句话是一点也不夸张的。
    原来估计人造卫星只能在黄昏或黎明时才能用肉眼看到。但一星期来我国北京、南京，苏联哈萨克，美国等地都在晚上看到了人造卫星。人造卫星离地面只有几百公里，不像月亮离地面三十八万公里，晚上太阳光应当被地球挡住而射不到人造卫星上。这第一个人造卫星似乎没有发光设备（苏联文献里提到有些人造卫星将装设断续发光的气灯），如果有的话，苏联公报里一定会提到。好些地方在晚上看到人造卫星，很可能是因为运载卫星的第三段火箭以及圆锥形保护物已经成为流星了，它们和空气摩擦而生热发光。由于速度比一般流星慢（每秒十一到七十八公里），运行轨道的空气也较稀薄，所以没有一般的流星亮。
    我们可以把人造卫星轨道在地面上的垂直投影线简称投影线。由于地球自转，投影线在向西移动着。苏联每天发出的消息只提到我国在投影线上或邻近的大城市看到人造卫星的时刻。在我国境内，相邻两投影线相隔约两千公里。在投影线两旁各一千公里范围内仍可以看到人造卫星，离投影线愈远卫星愈近东方或西方的地平线。这样看来，目前我国几乎全部地区都可以在每晚看到人造卫星最少一次，位于两投影线正中间的地区可以看到两次。许多人可能从报纸所载的时刻得到了错误的结论，以为只有北京、广州、成都等几个大城市能看到。前几天有月光，所以只有眼力很好的人才能看到人造卫星（实际上可能是已成为流星的火箭）。以后没有月光可以较容易看到。这是我个人的看法。
