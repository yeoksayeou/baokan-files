　　Drawing Lessons from Failure and Reorganizing the Team
    Louzhai Second Cooperative's Remedial Great Debate a Success
    According to a report in the Southern Daily, the Louzhai Second Agricultural Cooperative in Huiyang County, Guangdong Province, learned from the failures of the previous stage of the Great Debate, made full preparations, and relaunched the Great Debate, finally refuting the opposing views.
    Louzhai Second Cooperative was a pilot cooperative for the Great Debate in Huiyang County. During the "airing" phase, this cooperative repeatedly dispelled the concerns of cadres and the masses, promoted democracy, and more than 90% of the cooperative members expressed their opinions, basically meeting the requirements of "airing deeply and thoroughly." However, when it came to the Great Debate, they had not analyzed what the opposing arguments were beforehand. They had not collected the materials to refute them. Nor did they ascertain whether the upper-middle peasants dared to step forward and debate. The debate team that was organized only underwent education through recalling and comparing the past and present; they had not studied the opposing views, nor had they clarified the rights and wrongs of the issues through small debates. In this situation, they hastily launched the Great Debate.

    Charging into battle empty-handed, fighting an unprepared war, the debate reached a stalemate
    Because they were fighting an unprepared war, the debate became a stalemate from the start. In one situation, everyone spoke empty generalities about the superiority of cooperation, and there was no debate. In another situation, there were no materials, and the debate was nonsensical. For example, poor peasant cooperative member Hu Zhenyou said, "I say the cooperative is no good; many people are overdrawn." The activists refuted him by saying, "Your life is so much better now than before liberation, yet you say the cooperative is no good; you're really forgetting your roots." Another example is upper-middle peasant Zhang Er who said, "What's good about the cooperative? The cooperative plants one 'dan' (ten 'dou') of seeds but doesn't do as well as when I planted one 'luo' (five 'dou') by myself." The activists merely said, "Who gave you your land? Before liberation, you tilled the landlord's land and were exploited, and as a result, you sold an ox to pay rent. Have you forgotten all this?!" They did not refute the points that others had raised, and they hastily ended the debate. As a result, the members' awareness was not raised, and many fallacies were not refuted. The upper-middle peasants instead gossiped amongst themselves: "If the cooperative is so good, why are 80% of the members overdrawn?" "Each work day is worth two jiao and five fen; what's good about the cooperative?"… Some poor peasants also felt the same way. According to a check of 112 cooperative member households, 38% had not distinguished between the two roads of socialism and capitalism. Middle peasant He Guanren even suggested withdrawing from the cooperative after the debate.

    Drawing lessons, organizing a debate team, collecting materials, launching a truly democratic Great Debate, and refuting various fallacies
    In mid-September, in accordance with the spirit of the instructions from higher authorities, this cooperative reviewed and summarized the previous stage of the "Great Airing, Great Blooming, Great Debate" work. Then, they conducted a remedial Great Debate. This time, they learned from the previous failures, first conducting debates among cadres and Party members to distinguish right from wrong, clarifying the purpose and significance of the Great Debate, and forming a debate team. At the same time, they seriously analyzed and identified the opposing arguments, collecting various materials around these arguments. Cadres went deep into the households to conduct personal investigations. For example, they collected information on the production and income of individual farming and mutual aid teams, how much a work day was worth, why overdrawn households were overdrawn, the amount of grain retained by poor and middle peasants before the unified purchase and sale, and why they said it was not enough to eat now when the average amount of grain retained per person was 450 jin, clearly enough to eat, and what the reason was. After the materials were collected, they were gathered together and brought to the debate team for discussion to arm everyone's minds. In addition, they also implemented rectification while improving, actively solving current problems that could be solved, and mobilizing the enthusiasm of the masses.

    The prepared and truly democratic Great Debate was launched. First, they debated the issue of the cooperative road. Those who doubted and denied cooperation said, "If the cooperative is so good, why are 80% of the households in the cooperative overdrawn?" The cooperative members who supported cooperation then analyzed the reasons for the overdrawn households based on the collected materials. There were three types of overdrawn households: the first type was those who asked the cooperative for everything, resulting in overdrafts due to excessive borrowing; the second type was those who engaged in too much household sideline production, privately riding bicycles, etc., resulting in fewer work days and thus overdrafts; and the third type was genuinely needy households with overdrafts. According to the ranking, the first two types accounted for 70%, and the third type accounted for only 30%. Most of the third type of overdrawn households were due to a large population and a small labor force, or illness, etc. For example, Yu Wenxiang's family of four had only one person working, so they were overdrawn by 20 yuan. Another example is Li Dingxiu's family of five, with two people working. Her sister was sick and spent more than 100 yuan, so they were overdrawn. After analyzing the reasons for the overdrafts, they turned around and examined the situation during individual farming and mutual aid. In fact, many people were overdrawn at that time, but the form was different. The specific manifestations were: first, selling revolving grain, accounting for 70% of the households in the cooperative; second, selling green crops and borrowing money, a total of 32 households; and third, defaulting on public grain, with 28 households in Louxia Village alone. After such a specific analysis, this problem was solved. Those who denied the superiority of cooperation then said, "If the cooperative is superior, why was one work day only worth two jiao and five fen last year?" Some members refuted, "Last year, the early rice crop suffered a severe drought, with 75% of the cooperative's fields affected by the drought. After fighting the drought for more than 50 days, 544 mu of rain-fed land were lost; the late rice crop was also threatened by drought, and the annual rice production was reduced, so the value of work days was low. Even so, it was still better than individual farming. For example, Louxia Village had 16 mu of land, and fighting the drought required going more than two 'li.' During individual farming, if there was a drought, there would be no harvest. Last year, the cooperative harvested 150 jin per mu. If it were not for the cooperative, in such a drought, roughly calculating, at least 79 households in the cooperative would have gone bankrupt and heavily indebted." On the other hand, they also calculated a detailed account based on the collected materials. In the year before cooperation, when the year was normal, the value of each work day for middle peasants was two jiao and five fen (excluding sideline occupations), and for poor peasants, it was only two jiao, proving that the value of work days had increased after cooperation.

    Those who denied cooperation also said, "After joining the cooperative, there is no day or night, you work yourself to death, and there is no freedom." Other members debated: agricultural cooperatives generally start work at 7 am and finish at 6 pm, only during the busy farming season do they go out early and return late, and sometimes because of poor work scheduling, they don't start work until the sun is high. But during individual farming, you have to do everything yourself, taking care of this and neglecting that, often accompanied by stars and the moon, truly working yourself to death. Many people also said: after joining the cooperative, you work hard, have food and clothing, and there is no "lack of freedom."

    Other arguments concerning the denial of cooperation and the unified purchase of grain were also refuted one by one because they had fully collected materials, used specific facts and sufficient reasoning, and promoted democratic debate.

    After remedial debate, distinguishing between right and wrong
    After such a remedial debate, the Louzhai Second Cooperative basically distinguished the major issues of right and wrong on the two roads. Li Binghua, who had previously insisted on opposing views, said, "So many people are overdrawn, and one work day is only worth two jiao and five fen. I toss and turn in bed and can't figure out what's good about the cooperative. After this debate, I really understand." He Guanren, who had said the cooperative was no good after the first debate and suggested withdrawing, said he would not withdraw. The upper-middle peasants in Dalubei Village, who had been gossiping in the background, were now convinced.

　　吸取失败教训　重新组织队伍
    楼寨二社进行大辩论补课成功
    据南方日报消息　广东惠阳县楼寨第二农业社，吸取前一阶段大辩论失败的教训，充分准备，重新开展大辩论，终于驳倒反面意见。
    楼寨二社是惠阳县大辩论试点社。这个社在鸣放时，反复解除干部和群众顾虑，发扬了民主，全社90％以上的社员发表了意见，基本达到鸣深放透的要求。但是，转入大辩论时，事先对反面的论点是什么？没有分析。用那些材料去反驳？没有收集。上中农敢不敢起来争辩？也不摸底。所组织的辩论队伍，只是进行了回忆对比的教育，没有提出反面意见来研究过，也没有经过小争，分清问题的是非。在这样情况下，就匆匆的开展了大辩论。
    空枪上阵，打无准备的仗，辩论成僵局
    由于打无准备的仗，辩论一开始就成僵局。一种情况是：大家都讲合作化优越的空洞大道理，辩不起来。另一种情况是：没有材料，辩得牛头不对马嘴。如贫农社员胡珍友说：“我说合作社不好，很多人超支。”积极分子反驳他时，只是这样说：“你现在生活不知比解放前好多少，还说合作社不好，真是忘本。”又如上中农张二说：“合作社好在那里，社里种一担种（十斗）不如我单干时种一箩（五斗）好。”积极分子只是说：“你的田是谁分给你的？解放前耕地主的田，受剥削，结果卖了一条牛交租，这些你就忘记了？！”根本没有针对着别人提出的问题进行反驳，就草草收兵了。结果是经过这一场空枪上阵的辩论，社员的觉悟没有得到提高，很多谬论没有被驳倒。上中农反而三三两两在背后议论着：“说合作社好，为什么八成社员超支？”
  “每个劳动日二角五分钱，合作社好在那里？”……一部分贫农也是这样认识。据检查一百一十二户社员，其中有38％没有分清两条道路的大是大非。中农何观仁辩论后反而提出要退社。
    吸取教训，组织辩论队伍，收集材料，展开真正的民主大辩论，驳倒各种谬论
    9月中旬，这个社根据上级指示精神，检查和总结了前段大放大鸣大争工作。然后进行了一次大辩论补课。这回，他们吸取了前次的教训，事先在干部和党员中展开辩论，分清是非，弄明大辩论的目的和意义，组成辩论队伍。同时，认真分析找出反面论点，围绕这些论点收集各种材料，干部深入到户，亲自调查。例如，收集单干和互助组生产、收入情况，劳动日值多少，超支户为什么超支，统购统销前贫农和中农留粮数量，现在平均每人留粮四百五十斤明明是够吃，为什么又说不够吃，原因在那里？等等。材料收集好后，集中起来，拿到辩论队伍中讨论，武装大家思想。另外，还贯彻边整边改，积极解决当前能够解决的问题，调动群众积极性。
    有准备的真正的民主大辩论开展了。首先，是辩论合作化道路问题。怀疑和否定合作化的人说：“合作社既然好，为什么全社有八成超支户？”拥护合作化的社员便根据收集的材料，具体分析超支户超支的原因。超支户有三种情况：第一种是样样伸手向社要，由于借支过多造成超支；第二种是多搞家庭副业，私自跑单车等等，劳动日少，因而超支；第三种是真正有困难的户超支。据排队，前两种占70％，第三种只占30％。第三种超支户，绝大部分是由于人口多，劳动力少，或者患病等。例如余文香，一家四口人，只有一个人劳动，因此超支二十元。又如李丁秀，一家五口人，两个人劳动，因为妹妹生病，花了一百多元，所以超支。分析了超支原因后，又反过来检查单干和互助时情况。其实那时也是有许多人超支，只是形式不同而已。具体表现是：一是卖周转粮，占全社户数70％；二是卖青苗、借债，共三十二户；三是拖欠公粮，单是楼下村就有二十八户。经过这样具体分析，这个问题便解决了。否定合作化优越性的人又说：“如果合作社优越，为什么去年一个劳动日只分二角五分钱？”有的社员便驳斥道：去年早造遭受严重的旱灾，全社75％的田受旱，一连抗旱五十多天后，还有五百四十四亩望天田失收；晚造也遭受干旱威胁，全年水稻减产，因此劳动日值低。即使是这样，也比单干强。如楼下村有十六亩田，抗旱要经过二里多路，单干时遇上天旱颗粒不收，而去年合作社每亩收一百五十斤。如果不是合作社，在这样旱灾下，粗略计算一下，全社最少有七十九户人会破产和负债累累。另一方面又根据收集材料算了一个细账，合作化前一年，年景正常，那时中农的每个劳动日值二角五分（不包括副业），贫农的才二角，证明合作化后劳动日值是有所提高的。
    否定合作化的人又说：“入了社有日无夜，辛苦死，又不自由。”另外一些社员便辩论说：农业社一般是早上七点出工至晚上六点收工，只有农忙时才早出晚归，有时还因为排工不好，太阳一杆子高才出工。但是单干时，自打锣鼓自己唱，顾了这，丢了那，常常伴星星伴月亮，才是辛苦死。许多人又说：入了社，勤劳动，有吃有穿，并没有什么“不自由”。
    其他有关否定合作化和粮食统购的各种论点，也是由于充分收集了材料，运用具体事实和充足道理，发扬民主进行争辩，一一被驳倒。
    经过辩论补课  分清大是大非
    楼寨二社经过这样的辩论补课后，两条道路的大是大非基本上分清了。原来坚持反面意见的李秉华说：“这样多人超支，一个劳动日只分二角五分钱，我睡在床上翻来复去也想不通合作社好在那里，经过这样争论后，我真正想通了。”第一次辩论后还说合作社不好，提出要退社的何观仁，表示不退社了。大路背村三三两两在背后说怪话的上中农，已口服心服。
