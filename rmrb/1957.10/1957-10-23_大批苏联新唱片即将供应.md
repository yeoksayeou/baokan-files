    Large Batch of New Soviet Records Soon to be Available
    
    Forty kinds of new Soviet records are being reproduced at the China Record Factory in Shanghai. The first batch of more than 20,000 records will be released from the factory before the end of the month to meet the needs of the masses celebrating the October Revolution.

    The content of these reproduced new records is very rich, including "Why We Love Our Motherland," composed by Akulenko and sung by Shurupova, "We Praise Labor," sung by the Russian Chorus, and "Autumn Night" composed by Glinka. The violin solo performed by the Soviet violinist David Oistrakh, who performed in Shanghai a few days ago, will also be reproduced this time.

    From the second half of 1954 to the present, the China Record Factory has reproduced 225 kinds of Soviet records.

    大批苏联新唱片即将供应
    四十种新的苏联唱片正在上海中国唱片厂复制。第一批复制的两万多张唱片，将在月底以前出厂，满足群众庆祝十月革命节的需要。
    这些复制的新唱片内容非常丰富，有阿库连科作曲、舒鲁波娃演唱的“为什么我们热爱自己的祖国”，有俄罗斯合唱队合唱的“我们赞美劳动”，有由格林卡作曲的“秋夜”。前几天在上海演出的苏联小提琴家奥伊斯特拉赫所演奏的小提琴独奏曲，这次也要复制一批。
    从1954年下半年开始到现在，中国唱片厂已经复制出苏联唱片二百二十五种。
