Give the People More Meat and Milk
　　Jun Qiang
    In May of this year, at a conference of agricultural workers in the Northwest Region of the Russian Federation, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Khrushchev, called for the Soviet Union to catch up with the United States in the per capita production of meat, milk, and oils during this five-year plan. The specific tasks are to basically catch up with the United States in per capita meat production by 1960, and to catch up with the United States in milk and oils production as early as next year. This inspiring call immediately won a warm response from all the working people of the Soviet Union, especially the farmers.

    Just as the working people of the world are jubilantly welcoming the fortieth anniversary of the great October Revolution, the rapid economic development of the Soviet Union is particularly exciting. In just forty short years, the Soviet Union has transformed a backward country into a first-class powerful country in the world. In many respects, it has surpassed some so-called "advanced" capitalist countries. Today, it has leaped to second place in the world in terms of industrial production level and has achieved first place in the world in terms of scientific level. However, the Soviet people, as builders of communism, are not satisfied with this. Last spring, the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union put forward another basic economic task: to catch up with and surpass the most developed capitalist countries in terms of per capita output in the shortest historical period. The achievements that the Soviet people have made in agriculture in recent years, especially the great achievements in grain production, have provided them with the basic conditions for realizing this task in animal products.

    The call to vigorously increase the production of animal products is a clear indication of the constant concern of the Communist Party and the government of the Soviet Union for improving the people's lives and welfare. Because continuously expanding the production of animal products can provide people with more food and can supply the light industry with more raw materials, which has a direct impact on improving people's living standards.

    The call to surpass the United States in animal products production specifically embodies the Soviet Union's consistent advocacy of the policy of peaceful coexistence between the two systems, and also embodies the peaceful competition between the two systems. Socialism does not need to compete with capitalism through military force, nor does it need to engage in military expansion. The Soviet Union has always advocated that the two systems can compete on the basis of economic development. Because such competition is beneficial to people living under both systems, and the Soviet Union believes that socialism will surely achieve victory in the competition.

    What is the current state of production of meat, milk, and oils in the Soviet Union and the United States? The production figures for last year can give us an outline of the situation in this regard.

    (1) Average per capita output (1956)
　　　　        Soviet Union　　United States
　　Meat　　32.3 kg　　102.3 kg
　　Milk　　245 kg　　343 kg
　　Oils　　2.8 kg　　3.8 kg

    (2) Output per 100 hectares of agricultural land (1956)
　　　　        Soviet Union　　United States
　　Meat　13.3 quintals (net weight)　　33 quintals (net weight)
　　Milk　101 quintals　　111 quintals

    According to the figures listed in Table (1), the Soviet Union's annual meat production needs to reach 20 million to 21 million tons, which is a 2.5-fold increase over the 1956 output, and the annual milk production needs to reach 70 million tons, which is a 40% increase over 1956, in order to catch up with the United States. If calculated per 100 hectares of agricultural land (according to Table (2)), meat production needs to reach 67 quintals (42 quintals net weight), and milk production needs to reach 141 quintals, in order to catch up with the United States in per capita terms. The task is, of course, arduous, especially in meat production.

    What specific conditions will the Soviet Union rely on to increase animal products so rapidly in such a short period of time? Generally speaking, it will be realized based on the overall development of industry, agriculture, science, and other aspects, especially relying on the great development of agriculture and animal husbandry. As everyone knows, since the September Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee in 1953, the Communist Party and the government of the Soviet Union have adopted a series of measures to improve agricultural production. For example, about 150,000 cadres were dispatched to rural areas to strengthen the work of collective farms, a new planning system was implemented, and the material interests of agricultural workers were improved. The most prominent achievement of the Soviet Union in developing agriculture is that it has reclaimed a large amount of wasteland in recent years, which made 1956 an unprecedented bumper year, and the total grain harvest increased by 50% compared with 1953.

    On the basis of the great development of agriculture, the Soviet Union's animal husbandry has also achieved amazing development in recent years. From 1953 to 1956, the number of cattle, pigs, and sheep each increased by 8 to 9 million. The procurement volume of various animal products in 1956 increased significantly compared with 1953. Among them, meat increased by 25% and milk increased by 70%. The development speed of animal husbandry in some collective farms is very amazing. For example, in the collective farm in Kalinovka Village, Kursk Oblast, every 100 hectares of agricultural land only produced 8 quintals of meat in 1953, 31 quintals in 1955, and 60 quintals in 1956. This year, the villagers proposed to reach 90 quintals. That is to say, the meat production of this farm this year will increase to eleven times that of 1953. This development of animal husbandry in collective farms specifically embodies the correctness of the Communist Party and the government of the Soviet Union in vigorously developing agriculture in recent years, demonstrates the infinite power of the collective farm system, and also demonstrates the patriotic enthusiasm and production enthusiasm of agricultural workers under the call of the Party and the government.

    In recent years, the development speed of Soviet animal husbandry production, like the development speed of Soviet industrial production, has been much faster than that of the United States. Taking milk as an example, in the past six years (1950-1956), the total milk production in the Soviet Union increased by 39%, and the per capita output increased by 26%. In the same period, the total milk production in the United States only increased by 8%, and the per capita output not only did not increase, but decreased by 2%. In addition, the milk production in some regions of the Soviet Union, calculated on a per capita basis, had already exceeded the United States last year, such as the three Baltic republics of Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania. The Ukrainian Republic can also catch up with the United States this year. Therefore, judging from the growth rate of animal products production, the task put forward by the Soviet Communist Party can be successfully completed.

    Another important condition for ensuring the realization of this huge task is the activeness and enthusiasm of agricultural workers. Many places, the entire district, the entire state, participated in the socialist competition, striving to produce more animal products on every 100 hectares of agricultural land, and to reach 100 quintals of meat and 400 quintals of milk on every 100 hectares of agricultural land in the next few years. This competition movement was initiated in April this year by Andreeva, the female chairman of the "Communist International" collective farm in Tambov Oblast, and has now become a nationwide competition. In order to complete their tasks, agricultural workers have studied many methods and taken various measures. In terms of increasing meat production, the first is to vigorously develop the pig industry. The number of pigs in the Soviet Union was originally similar to that in the United States. However, due to fattening reasons, meat production was less. Now farmers are working hard to improve fattening work, promote advanced breeding methods, and pay attention to the planting of feed crops. In terms of increasing beef production, in addition to increasing the number of heads, attention is now being paid to raising calves to larger sizes before slaughter, so that a large amount of beef can be obtained. In addition, attention is also paid to improving the feeding work at cattle reception stations and on the way to slaughterhouses, etc. Vigorously developing poultry farming to increase meat is now also receiving widespread attention from agricultural workers.

    Under the call and help of the Soviet Party and government, on the basis of the great development of agriculture, the active efforts of laborers have achieved remarkable results. In the first half of this year, the meat produced by collective farms and state farms increased by 30% compared with the same period last year, and milk increased by 26%. The number of cattle, pigs, and sheep each increased by 3 million to 5 million. Judging from the preliminary achievements already obtained, the task put forward by the Soviet Communist Party to surpass the United States in meat and milk production can be successfully completed.

### 给人民更多的肉和牛奶

　　给人民更多的肉和牛奶
　　君强
    今年5月，在俄罗斯联邦西北地区农业工作者会议上，苏联共产党中央委员会第一书记赫鲁晓夫，提出了苏联要在这一个五年计划期间在肉类、牛奶和油脂的生产上按人口平均计算赶上美国的号召。具体的任务是，要使肉类按人口平均计算在1960年基本上赶上美国，牛奶和油脂则在明年就要赶上美国。这个鼓舞人心的号召，立即博得了苏联全体劳动人民、特别是农民的热烈响应。
    正当全世界劳动人民欢欣鼓舞迎接伟大的十月革命四十周年的时候，苏联经济的飞跃发展，特别令人感到兴奋。苏联在短短的四十年中，把一个落后的国家改建成为世界上第一流的强大国家，在许多方面它已赶过了一些号称“先进”的资本主义国家。今天它在工业生产水平上已跃居为世界第二位，在科学水平上已取得了世界第一位。但是作为共产主义建设者的苏联人民并不满足于此。去年春天苏联共产党第二十次代表大会又提出了一项基本经济任务：要在最短的历史时期内在按人口平均计算的产量方面赶上并超过最发达的资本主义国家。近年来苏联人民在农业方面获得的成就，特别是在谷物生产方面的巨大成就，使他们具备了在畜产品上实现这项任务的基本条件。
    大力增产畜产品的号召，是苏联共产党和政府不断关怀提高人民生活和福利的明证。因为不断扩大畜产品的生产，可以使人民得到更多的食品，可以供给轻工业更多的原料，这对提高人民生活水平有直接影响。
    在畜产品生产上赶过美国的号召，具体体现了苏联所一贯主张的两个制度和平共处的政策，也体现了两个制度的和平竞赛。社会主义不需要同资本主义进行武力比赛，不需要进行武力扩张。苏联历来主张两个制度可以在经济发展的基础上来进行比赛。因为这样的比赛，对在两个制度下生活的人们有利，而且苏联相信，在比赛中社会主义一定能够取得胜利。
    目前，苏联和美国在肉类、牛奶和油脂方面的生产情况是怎样呢？去年的生产数字，可以给我们了解这方面情况的一个轮廓。
    （一）按人口平均产量（1956年）
    　　　　 苏联　　美国
　　肉类　　32.3公斤　　102.3公斤
　　牛奶　　245公斤　　343公斤
　　油脂　　2.8公斤　　3.8公斤
    （二）每100公顷农业用地产量（1956年）
　　　　    苏联　　美国
　　肉类　13.3公担（净重）　　33公担（净重）
　　牛奶　101公担　　111公担
    根据表（一）所列数字计算，苏联的肉类年产量需要达到二千万吨到二千一百万吨，即较1956年产量增加二倍半，牛奶年产量需要达到七千万吨，即较1956年增加40％，便可赶上美国。如果按每一百公顷农业用地计算（根据表（二）），肉产量需要达到六十七公担（净重四十二公担），牛奶产量需要达到一百四十一公担，即可按人口平均计算赶上美国。任务当然是艰巨的，特别是在肉类生产方面。
    苏联要在这样短短的几年内如此迅速地提高畜产品，它准备依靠些什么具体条件呢？总的来说，它要根据工业、农业、科学等各方面总的发展来实现，尤其是要依靠农业和饲畜业的大发展来实现。大家知道，自从1953年苏共中央九月全会以来，苏联共产党和政府采取了一系列提高农业生产的措施。例如，曾派遣了约十五万干部到农村去加强集体农庄的工作，实行新的计划制度，提高农业工作者的物质利益等。苏联发展农业的最突出的成就，就是几年来开垦了大量荒地，使1956年获得了空前未有的丰收，使谷物总收获量比1953年增加了50％。
    在农业大发展的基础上，苏联的饲畜业几年来也获得了惊人的发展。从1953年到1956年，牛、猪、羊的头数各增加了八九百万头。1956年各种畜产品的采购量比1953年增加了许多。其中肉增加了25％，牛奶增加了70％。有一些集体农庄饲畜业的发展速度是非常惊人的。例如库尔斯克州卡里诺夫卡村的集体农庄，1953年每一百公顷农业用地只生产了八公担肉，1955年就生产了三十一公担，1956年生产了六十公担，今年庄员们提出要达到九十公担。即是说，这个农庄今年的肉产量增加到1953年的十一倍。集体农庄饲畜业的这种发展，具体体现了苏联共产党和政府近年来大力发展农业的正确性，说明了集体农庄制度的无限威力，同时也说明了农业工作者们在党和政府号召下的爱国热情和生产的积极性。
    近年来，苏联饲畜业生产发展的速度与苏联工业生产发展的速度一样，都比美国要快得多。以牛奶为例，在最近六年中（1950—1956），苏联的牛奶总产量增加了39％，按人口平均计算的产量增加了26％。在同一时期，美国的牛奶总产量却只增加了8％，按人口平均计算的产量不但没有增加，反而减少了2％。此外，苏联有些地区的牛奶产量，按人口平均计算在去年即已超过了美国，如波罗的海沿岸的拉脱维亚、爱沙尼亚和立陶宛三个共和国。乌克兰共和国也可以在今年赶过美国。所以，从畜产品生产增长的速度看，苏联提出的任务是能够胜利完成的。
    保证这项巨大任务实现的另一个重要条件，是农业工作者的积极性和热情。许多地方是整个区、整个州地参加了社会主义竞赛，争取在每一百公顷农业用地上生产更多的畜产品，要在最近几年内达到每一百公顷农业用地生产一百公担肉，四百公担牛奶。这个竞赛运动是今年4月由唐波夫州“共产国际”集体农庄的女主席安德列耶娃发起的，现在已成为全民的竞赛了。农业工作者为了完成自己的任务，研究了许多办法，采取了各种措施。在增产肉类方面，首先是大力发展养猪业。苏联猪的头数原和美国差不多。但因肥育方面的原因，肉产量较少。现在农民们正在努力改善肥育工作，推广先进饲养方法，注意饲料作物的种植等。在牛肉的增产上，除增加头数外，现在开始注意把小牛养大后再宰杀，这样可以多得到大量牛肉。此外，也注意到改善在牛的验收站和运往屠宰场途中的饲养工作等等。大力发展养禽业来增加肉类，现在也正普遍受到农业工作者的注意。
    在苏联党和政府的号召和帮助下，在农业大发展的基础上，劳动者的积极努力已获得了显著成绩。今年上半年集体农庄和国营农场所生产的肉类，比去年同一时期增加了30％，牛奶增加了26％。牛、猪、羊的头数都各增加了三百万至五百万头。从已经获得的初步成就看，苏联共产党所提出的要在肉类和牛奶生产上赶过美国的这一任务，是能够胜利完成的。（附图片）
