Xinhua News Agency, 12th: The Chinese Communist Party Committee of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant recently organized more than 300 worker representatives to inspect the handling of problems and improvements in work during the rectification campaign. As a result of the inspection, the worker representatives were satisfied with the handling and resolution of most of the problems. However, they found that a few cadres had not truly recognized their shortcomings ideologically and had not further established a work style of relying on the masses. Therefore, when they made self-criticisms to the workers, they either had a poor attitude or admitted everything without analysis. Niu Zengyi, a worker in the coking workshop, reported to the representatives that he believed that An Fen, the former furnace chief of a coke oven, had mistakenly believed that he was not dedicated to his work and had twice affected his promotion. He had raised this issue with An Fen during the rectification campaign. However, An Fen not only did not examine himself but also asked Niu Zengyi who had told him this. After the worker representatives reported these situations to Xing Yingguang, the secretary of the Party branch, Xing Yingguang criticized An Fen and helped him recognize his shortcomings. An Fen sincerely apologized to Niu Zengyi again, eliminating the years of accumulated estrangement between the two.

Some problems, although assigned to specific personnel for handling and given specific timeframes, have still not been resolved due to a lack of supervision and inspection. A group in the iron smelting department proposed that railings should be installed next to the railway near their workplace to ensure safety. The leadership had determined that it would be done in September, but because the person in charge had been transferred, the railings had not been installed by the time the representatives inspected on October 4.

The representatives also found that some opinions, although addressed, were not handled thoroughly enough or were not very appropriate, and needed further study and improvement. For example, the workers who load the small blast furnaces had previously reported to the leading cadres that the tracks were bad and the material carts were difficult to push. During the rectification campaign, only one repair was carried out, and this was listed as a resolved issue, but when the representatives asked the workers, they found that the material carts were still difficult to push.

During the inspection, the worker representatives also found that some problems arising from unsound production management systems were temporarily resolved during the rectification campaign, but because there was no fundamental solution from the system, some problems may reoccur or have already reoccurred. In the past, because the iron smelting department did not coordinate well with the transportation department, the slag from the small blast furnaces had piled up into "Erlang Mountain," affecting the workers' work. Although "Erlang Mountain" was removed during the rectification campaign, the iron smelting and transportation departments have not yet formulated specific collaborative measures to deal with the slag from the small blast furnaces, so "Erlang Mountain" may reform.

Based on the problems discovered by the worker representatives, the factory's Chinese Communist Party Committee plans to organize forces to continue to resolve them, and to focus on revising or formulating some systems to ensure that certain problems do not recur.

### 石景山钢铁厂  组织职工代表进行检查  发现有些问题实际上并没有真正解决

　　石景山钢铁厂
    组织职工代表进行检查
    发现有些问题实际上并没有真正解决
    据新华社12日讯　石景山钢铁厂中共党委会组织部分职工代表三百多人，最近视察了本厂整风中处理问题和改进工作的情况。视察结果，职工代表们对绝大部分问题的处理和解决是满意的，但是职工代表们发现有少数干部还没有真正从思想上认识到自己的缺点，更进一步树立依靠群众的作风。因此当他们向职工进行检讨的时候，或者态度不好，或者是不加分析就一古脑儿承认下来。炼焦车间工人牛增义向代表反映：他认为由于一焦炉炉长安芬过去误认为他不安心工作，曾两次影响他升级。他在整风期间就这事给安芬提了意见。可是安芬不但没有检查自己，反而追问牛增义是听谁说的。职工代表把这些情况反映给党总支书记邢英光以后，邢英光批评了安芬，并且帮助他认识自己的缺点。安芬重新向牛增义诚恳作了检讨，消除了两人中间积累几年的隔阂。
    有一些问题虽然规定了专人处理和处理的时间，但是由于缺乏督促检查，至今仍拖着没有解决。炼铁部有一个小组提出应该在他们工作附近的铁路旁安置栏杆，以保证安全。领导方面曾确定在9月份办理，但是由于负责人调动了工作，一直到10月4日代表们视察的时候，栏杆还没有安上。
    代表们还发现有些意见虽然经过处理，可是处理得不够彻底，或是不很恰当，还需要进一步研究改进。比如小高炉上料工人过去向领导干部反映铁道不好，料车推不动。整风中只经过一次修理，也被列为已经解决的问题，但是代表们一问工人，发现料车还是推不动。
    职工代表们在视察中，还发现有些由于生产管理制度不健全而发生的问题，在整风中暂时解决了，但因为没有从制度上“治本”，因此有些问题又有可能产生或已经产生。炼铁部过去因为和运输部协作得不好，小高炉的炉渣曾堆积成“二郎山”，影响工人工作。“二郎山”虽然在整风中被运走了，但是炼铁和运输部门还没有拟定协作具体办法来处理小高炉炉渣，因此“二郎山”还有重新形成的可能。
    根据职工代表发现的问题，这个工厂的中共党委准备组织力量继续解决，并且着重修订或制定一些制度，来保证某些问题不再发生。
