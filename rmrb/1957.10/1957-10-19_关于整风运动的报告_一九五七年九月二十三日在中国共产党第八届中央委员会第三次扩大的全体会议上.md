The rectification campaign and the struggle against the rightists, which began in May this year, were mainly conducted in party and government organs at the provincial and municipal levels, colleges and universities, democratic parties, the press and publishing industry, the scientific and technological community, the literary and artistic community, and the medical community until August. From August onwards, the campaign gradually expanded to workers, peasants, the industrial and commercial sectors, and primary and secondary school teachers and staff. The military also launched a rectification campaign. Now, it is expanding into a nationwide rectification movement.

Comrade Mao Zedong, at a meeting of some provincial and municipal party secretaries in Qingdao in July, made a comprehensive assessment of the nature and situation of the rectification campaign and the struggle against the rightists, and proposed clear guidelines for the development of the movement. Now, the movement across the country is proceeding smoothly according to the central guidelines.

The significance of this criticism of the bourgeois rightists should not be underestimated. It is a socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts. The socialist revolution in 1956 on the economic front (in terms of ownership of the means of production) is not enough and is not secure. The current nationwide debate is solving and will solve major issues such as whether the revolutionary and construction work is correct (whether the achievements of the revolution and construction are mainly positive), whether to follow the socialist path, whether to need the leadership of the Communist Party, whether to need the dictatorship of the proletariat, whether to need democratic centralism, and whether China's foreign policy is correct. If we cannot achieve complete victory in this debate, we will not be able to move forward. As long as we are victorious in the debate, it will greatly promote China's socialist transformation and socialist construction.

This movement aims to resolve two types of contradictions: those between enemies and those within the people. In China's socialist revolutionary period, the contradiction between the bourgeois rightists and the people is an antagonistic, irreconcilable, and life-or-death struggle. Urban and rural counterrevolutionaries, landlords and rich peasants who are still engaged in sabotage activities in rural areas, and social elements such as hooligans, gangsters, thieves, murderers, rapists, embezzlers, and serious criminals who disrupt social order and violate laws and regulations, as well as those generally recognized as bad elements, their contradictions with the people are also antagonistic. Apart from these, all other contradictions are within the people.

The rectification within the people also involves two different social categories. The bourgeoisie and bourgeois intellectuals need to be transformed into socialists; the petty bourgeoisie (peasants and urban and rural individual laborers), especially the well-off middle peasants, also need to be transformed into socialists. The working class and the basic forces of the Communist Party need to rectify their work style.

The purpose of the rectification campaign is to guide the direction of struggle towards rectifying political direction, raising ideological level, correcting work shortcomings, uniting the broad masses, and isolating and splitting the bourgeois rightists and all anti-socialist elements.

Against the enemy, we must wage a resolute struggle, using methods of exposure, isolation, and splitting, and in some cases, punishment and suppression. Within the people, we mainly use educational methods, the method of "unity-criticism-unity." Criminals among the people must also be dealt with legally, and such punishment also has an educational effect.

Over the past four months, the development of the movement has fully conformed to the analysis of the Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, fully proving the correctness of the central guidelines.

The movement has proven the necessity of waging a resolute struggle against the bourgeois rightists and various anti-socialist elements in urban and rural areas. Their attacks on the socialist path and the leadership of the Communist Party have been extremely rampant and vicious. They have a program, organization, and plan, and their goal is to restore capitalist and reactionary rule.

The movement has proven the necessity of continuing socialist transformation among the bourgeoisie and bourgeois intellectuals, and among the petty bourgeoisie, especially the well-off middle peasants. Many of them still yearn for capitalism and are unhappy with socialism. The leadership of the proletariat and the Communist Party over them is not yet consolidated. They are the market for the activities of rightists. However, the vast majority of them can accept socialism after criticism and education. We must make great efforts to unite and educate the middle elements, so as to isolate the rightists and strengthen the leftists.

The movement has proven the necessity of conducting a large-scale socialist education campaign among the working class and the poor and lower-middle peasants in rural areas. They are the most resolute forces in defending socialism. Conducting socialist education among them can arm them with better weapons for the struggle. In addition, a small number of them still have petty-bourgeois ideas and may be influenced by the bourgeoisie. However, as long as we seriously present facts and reason, they are very easy to understand.

The movement has proven the necessity of conducting a large-scale rectification campaign among the basic forces of the Communist Party and the leading organs and cadres of various levels of party, government, people's organizations, and enterprises. The party is basically healthy, and the vast majority of party members and cadres are good. However, from the mass outpouring of opinions, we have exposed a large number of shortcomings in our work and style, some of which are very serious and dangerous if not corrected. At the same time, there are a small number of rightists among the party members and youth league members, and a portion of them have serious rightist tendencies.

The movement has proven that in the struggle, we must firmly trust the majority of the masses and fully utilize the mass line. Implementing the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend, presenting facts, reasoning, posting big-character posters, holding symposiums and debates, is the broadest socialist democracy, which bourgeois democracy cannot even dream of. This is the method of correctly handling contradictions among the people, and it is also the method of educating and uniting the masses to struggle against the enemy. Letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend, we burn the enemy and also burn our own shortcomings. This is what we require. The facts have proven that those who dare not implement the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend, fearing trouble, do not believe in the awakening level of the majority of the masses, do not believe in the wisdom and strength of the masses, this rightist viewpoint is very harmful and has already been refuted by the facts.

The development of the movement is healthy and has achieved remarkable results. Especially in those units where the outpouring of opinions was thorough, and those that paid attention to correcting work shortcomings, the results are more remarkable. The overall situation of the movement's development is: the rightists are isolated and split, the middle elements are leaning to the left, and the strength of the leftists is increasing.

However, the movement must continue to deepen and expand, and we cannot end it hastily or tighten it in the front and loosen it in the back. We must strive for complete victory. In the organs at the central, provincial (municipal), prefectural, and county levels, the movement must go through four stages: the stage of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend (while carrying out rectification), the stage of counterattacking the rightists (while carrying out rectification), the stage of focusing on rectification (while continuing to let a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend), and the stage of studying documents, criticism and self-criticism, and raising one's own level. In units where the struggle against the rightists has achieved decisive victory, we should promptly shift to the third stage of focusing on rectification, while continuing to criticize bourgeois ideology systematically. Of course, the stages of development of the movement in some units may not be exactly the same as in the organs. For example, in rural areas, there is letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend, and there is a struggle against bad elements and a criticism of well-off middle peasants, but this is different from the struggle against the rightists in the organs. For peasants and workers, socialist education should be conducted, but only a small number of people need criticism and self-criticism, and it is not possible for them to study documents, criticize, and reflect like organ cadres. Workers, peasants, and students should continue to let a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend in the stage of focusing on rectification, supervising and helping leading cadres to rectify, but it is not that they themselves focus on rectification, which is said to the leading cadres. In addition, if rightists are discovered in the third and fourth stages, or if the original rightists have not yet surrendered, there is still the task of struggling against the rightists. Therefore, the four stages should not be taken too rigidly. In short, for leading cadres, these four stages must be gone through and thoroughly understood. The complete victory of the movement is not only determined by the stage of struggling against the rightists but is particularly determined by the third stage of focusing on rectification and the fourth stage of studying documents, criticism and self-criticism, and raising one's own level.

(2) On the bourgeoisie and intellectuals

This struggle against the rightists is mainly conducted among the bourgeoisie and intellectuals. This includes industrial and commercial people, democratic parties, the educational sector, the press and publishing industry, the literary and artistic community, the scientific and technological community, the medical community, many staff members of state organs, and university students. Intellectuals are not a class; they belong to different classes, but given the current situation in China, most intellectuals come from bourgeois and petty-bourgeois families and have received bourgeois education. Therefore, for convenience, they are discussed together with the bourgeoisie.

The elimination of the bourgeoisie is a fundamental issue of the socialist revolution. The bourgeoisie, especially its intellectuals, is currently the main force that can compete with the proletariat. They still have political positions, political capital, and political influence, while the proletariat also needs their knowledge. However, if they do not resolutely undergo socialist transformation, conflict with the proletariat is inevitable. The only way out for bourgeois intellectuals is to transform themselves and serve the socialist economic base; otherwise, they risk becoming "gentlemen of the rafters" who are neither in heaven nor on earth.

The party's policy towards bourgeois elements and intellectuals has been consistent. The party implements a policy of redemption towards bourgeois industrialists and merchants and strives to have them continue to serve socialism. The party implements the policy of long-term coexistence and mutual supervision towards the various democratic parties. The party advocates letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend in the field of academic culture. All these policies and guidelines are based on socialism. The party has always insisted that bourgeois elements and bourgeois intellectuals must undergo thorough transformation and gradually become proletarianized. The leadership of the party, the dictatorship of the proletariat, and democratic centralism are absolutely not to be shaken. The party's basic policies, such as the policy of eliminating counterrevolutionaries, the policy of cooperation, and the policy of unified purchase and supply of major agricultural products, are absolutely not to be shaken. The propaganda and political education of Marxism-Leninism must be strengthened, erroneous thoughts must be criticized, and "poisonous weeds" must be uprooted. The opening of "poisonous weeds" is for the purpose of educating the masses from the opposite side, for uprooting them to use as fertilizer, and for tempering the proletariat and the broad masses in the struggle. The party also points out that treating the contradictions between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie as contradictions within the people is conditional on the bourgeoisie accepting our guidelines, accepting socialist transformation and the leadership of the party; otherwise, it will turn into an antagonistic contradiction.

The bourgeoisie did not resist the socialist transformation of 1956 mainly because: (1) they had no other way out economically; (2) after the "Three Antis" and "Five Antis," most of them realized that opposing the proletariat was a dead end; (3) the government made appropriate arrangements for them economically and politically after their joint ventures. However, the change of ownership does not mean the completion of the socialist revolution, let alone the extinction of class struggle. The political and ideological struggle between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat has not ended and can become acute again under certain conditions. The recent attacks by the rightists on the Communist Party and socialism illustrate this point.

In the socialist revolution, the bourgeoisie and bourgeois intellectuals are divided into left, middle, and right factions. The left faction stands for supporting socialism and the leadership of the party. The right faction resolutely opposes socialism and the leadership of the party. The left and right factions are minorities among the bourgeoisie and bourgeois intellectuals, with the majority being the middle faction. The rightists always want to attack the Communist Party and socialism but wait for the opportunity. The rightists believe that the Hungarian incident, the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend, the propaganda of correctly handling contradictions within the people, and the party's rectification are their "opportunities."

Rightist elements are generally from exploiting classes. Historically, many of them have participated in reactionary parties and were rightists during the democratic revolution. However, history develops, and people change. Some rightists during the democratic revolution have now changed. Conversely, some who were middle or even left during the democratic revolution are now rightists. This shows that new political divisions are inevitable in the socialist revolution.

The main arena for the activities of rightist elements is where intellectuals gather, such as universities, certain state organs, press and publishing agencies, literary and artistic groups, legal and judicial sectors, scientific and technological sectors, and medical sectors. Intellectuals have undergone several movements in the past, and most have made different degrees of progress. A small number have already become leftists. Most people can now accept or do not oppose socialism, but many of them are imbued with bourgeois worldviews. It will take a considerable amount of time for them to truly become proletarian intellectuals. Due to the relatively weak proletarian intellectual force and the possibility of the middle faction following the rightists under certain conditions, the rightist intellectuals were particularly rampant in this attack.

Rightist elements in the various democratic parties played a key role in the rightist attack because the people gave them a certain political position, allowing them to issue orders and recruit followers legally. The democratic parties are products of the democratic revolution, and some members have become leftists in the socialist revolutionary period, but the majority have not yet shifted from the bourgeois stance to the proletarian stance. Therefore, the rightists once dominated many organizations within the democratic parties.

The various reactionary programs proposed by the bourgeois rightists in their attacks on the party are essentially anti-socialist and anti-party leadership. Their main political arguments are: (1) advocating the economic and political system of the bourgeoisie and bourgeois culture, opposing the economic and political system of socialism and socialist culture; (2) opposing the basic policies of the state, such as foreign policy, the policy of unified purchase and supply, the policy towards intellectuals, and the Five Great Movements; (3) denying the achievements of the people's democratic revolution, the socialist revolution, and socialist construction, and denying that the party and the proletariat can lead the construction of the state; (4) opposing the party's leadership of state work and the party's leadership in various departments (especially in the fields of education, science, and technology), demanding the abolition of the party's leadership in certain primary units (especially in universities and press and publishing agencies).

The main arguments of the rightists in the field of academic culture are: outsiders cannot lead insiders. Marxism is dogmatism. Socialist countries have no science and culture, and if they do, it is not as good as in capitalist countries. They demand the restoration of bourgeois sociology, economics, history, and idealist philosophy. They demand "independence" and "freedom" from the party and the people's government: "freedom of the press," "freedom of publication," "freedom of literature and art," etc.

The attack by the rightists shows that the majority of the bourgeoisie and bourgeois intellectuals are still not convinced by the leadership of the proletariat and the Communist Party. The Communist Party, of course, cannot have leadership in a part of the democratic parties, intellectual circles, and industrial and commercial circles (rightists) because they are enemies. In the majority (middle faction), the leadership is not consolidated, and some cultural and educational units have not yet established party leadership. The rightists are determined to compete with us. After the competition, they failed and realized that their days are numbered and there is no hope. Only at this time will the majority of the bourgeoisie and bourgeois intellectuals (middle faction and some rightists) gradually become honest, gradually abandon their bourgeois stance, and stand on the side of the proletariat, making up their minds to accept the leadership of the proletariat.

After more than three months of struggle, the situation has changed greatly. In various democratic parties, universities, other intellectual circles, and provincial and municipal organs, the struggle has generally achieved decisive victory.

The current task is to carry the struggle against the rightists to the end. To this end, we must continue to oppose rightist tendencies, but we must also guard against the dangers of an overly broad scope of attack and simple and rough methods. We must strictly grasp the boundaries between extreme rightists, rightists, and middle-rightists, and always pay attention to reviewing the list of rightists in the units. For those incorrectly classified, corrections must be made in a timely manner. We must pay special attention to the work of uniting the middle faction and to promoting the splitting of the rightists, helping those who have shown signs of repentance to gradually transform.

In units where the struggle against the rightists has reached a conclusion, we must resolutely and promptly shift to the stage of rectification and ideological education. Currently, many units lack the determination to shift to rectification, which should be corrected. The so-called conclusion of the struggle against the rightists means that all rightists have been exposed, criticized, and isolated, and that the majority of rightists have bowed their heads in front of the masses, not that all rightists' confessions and explanations have reached a thorough level. There will always be a part of the rightists who will not repent, taking their reactionary views to the grave, and the majority of rightists will not truly transform in a short period. However, as long as they are isolated among the masses, our struggle is victorious.

Bourgeois intellectuals, apart from a small number who hold rightist views, also have other serious erroneous views, especially individualism, liberalism, anarchism, egalitarianism, and nationalism. In the stage of ideological education and self-criticism, we must concentrate our efforts on systematically criticizing these erroneous views. This is one of the most important tasks to be completed in this rectification campaign.

The ideological transformation of intellectuals is a long-term task, which may take more than ten years. However, during this campaign, we must conduct extensive socialist education among the general bourgeois intellectuals and the industrial and commercial circles, destroy the strongholds of bourgeois ideology, fundamentally change the political face of many cultural and educational units and democratic parties, establish a consolidated leadership over the middle faction, and consolidate it as soon as possible.

We must greatly strengthen the leading cadres of the cultural and educational front and thoroughly rectify many cultural and educational organizations. To build socialism, the working class must have its own technical cadre force, its own professors, teachers, scientists, journalists, writers, artists, and Marxist theorists. This is a large force, and it is not enough to have a small number. The whole party must pay attention to cultivating revolutionary specialists. All party cadres who have the conditions must seriously study theory and business, work hard, and make themselves into "red and expert" red specialists. To achieve this goal, the central and local governments must formulate specific plans in the near future and implement them vigorously.

To cultivate the intellectual force of the working class, we must also use revolutionary spirit to cultivate new intellectuals, innovate and strengthen ideological and political education and labor education in schools, strengthen the work of cultivating intellectuals from among workers and peasants, and systematically recruit outstanding revolutionary intellectuals into the party.

The current several million intellectuals, although most of them are middle faction, are generally willing to progress. The working class's plan to cultivate its own intellectual force must include them. We must see that they are an important asset of the state, and the economic and cultural construction of socialism and the cultivation of new forces all need their efforts. Therefore, we must make great efforts to unite, win over, and educate them, correct their erroneous views, help them carry out self-transformation, and use appropriate rather than rough methods to gradually make them shed their middle status and stand on the side of the working class. We must, through rectification and the study of Marxism-Leninism, help them to go deep among the masses, get close to reality, and have more conversations and make more friends with them, listen to their suggestions on work, and help them solve difficulties in their work. The shortcomings we had in these aspects in the past must be overcome. The opinions raised by intellectuals during the outpouring of opinions are mostly correct and should be seriously studied and handled. The policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend in academic and cultural work must be implemented with a series of specific measures. Of course, this is a socialist policy, and implementing this policy must follow the six criteria proposed by Comrade Mao Zedong, to flourish socialist rather than capitalist academic culture.

In dealing with rightist elements, the principle should be to combine severity with leniency. Politically and ideologically, we must struggle thoroughly, but in handling, we should not be too harsh, so as to continue to split and transform the rightists. However, we should not be too lenient, confusing the boundaries between enemies and friends and between right and wrong. In this matter, we must pay attention to grasping the degree.

In the socialist revolutionary period, we need a new united front that serves socialism. We should, on the basis of the six criteria, implement the policy of long-term coexistence and mutual supervision. The view that the democratic parties have no further use is wrong. The central committees of various democratic parties have recently held national rectification work conferences, and we should help them, while continuing to deepen the struggle at the central and provincial and municipal levels, to actively and step-by-step deepen the struggle into all grassroots organizations, and then shift to general rectification, abandoning the capitalist stance and taking the socialist stance.

The method of rectification for the backbone of the industrial and commercial circles is generally the same as that for the various democratic parties. General bourgeois elements, according to different situations, either participate in the rectification of the backbone of the industrial and commercial circles or form separate groups for rectification. For the activities of capitalist elements among the capitalists to resist socialist transformation and the infiltration of their ideology into the thoughts of the working masses, we must expose and criticize them. For their serious illegal activities, we must struggle, so as to educate the majority and consolidate the socialist position. "Underground factories" must be prohibited and turned into above-ground ones for management, supervision, and transformation. Small industrial and commercial operators should mainly conduct socialist education, and when possible, organize debates, similar to the rectification methods among workers and peasants. Those who have serious illegal activities should also be exposed and struggled against. In short, we must make all people in the industrial and commercial circles receive education and not forget a part of them (mainly small industrial and commercial operators) as in some past movements.

(3) On the countryside

The overall situation in the countryside is good: the cooperatives are basically consolidated, grain production has increased, and the style of work of the cadres has improved. However, due to the short time of running the cooperatives, lack of experience, and severe disasters, there are still difficulties and shortcomings.

The realization of cooperativization has basically solved the problem of ownership of the means of production, but this does not mean that there are no problems in the countryside.

Some peasants still have unclear understanding of the relationship between the state, the cooperative, and the family, and there are individualistic and parochial thoughts that do not consider the interests of the state and the collective. In the issue of unified purchase and supply, the contradictions between the well-off peasants and the state are more prominent, and many of them use various means to sell less surplus grain and other major agricultural products, and some even engage in speculation. Especially after the opening of the free market, the capitalist spontaneous tendencies of some peasants have resurfaced.

The vast majority of well-off middle peasants have joined the cooperatives due to the trend of the times, but most of them are still wavering in their thoughts. A few who insist on the capitalist road either, after being forced to join the cooperative, lead the disruption and demand to withdraw from the cooperative; or outside the cooperative, engage in activities to sabotage the cooperative. They always want to compete with the cooperative. In addition, they are also the main force resisting the policy of unified purchase and supply and engaging in grain speculation in the countryside.

Counterrevolutionaries, bad elements, and some landlords and rich peasants also seize the opportunity to engage in sabotage activities: spreading reactionary speeches, spreading rumors, promoting superstition, gambling, reversing accounts, inciting trouble, and even establishing counterrevolutionary organizations and causing riots.

Within the party, there has been a serious rightist tendency in the recent period: believing that the struggle between the two roads in the countryside has ended and that it is not necessary to emphasize the class line; that it is possible to focus on production and relax socialist education for the peasants. Being complacent about the sabotage activities of reactionaries and not giving them a timely and powerful blow. Among the rural cadres, there are also a few who, due to changes in their family economic status, have developed capitalist thoughts. These people, on basic issues such as cooperativization and unified purchase and supply, actually stand on the side of the well-off middle peasants and express doubts and dissatisfaction with the policies of the party and the state.

From this, it can be seen that, like in the cities, there is still a struggle between socialism and capitalism in the countryside. This struggle will take a long time to achieve a thorough victory. This is a task for the entire transitional period.

The socialist education campaign currently being carried out in the countryside aims to: (1) clarify right and wrong in the great debate and firmly believe in and decide to follow the socialist path; (2) criticize the capitalist and individualistic thoughts of the well-off middle peasants and overcome the capitalist influence in the countryside; (3) expose and strike at the sabotage activities of landlords, rich peasants, counterrevolutionaries, and other bad elements; (4) on the basis of mass criticism and self-criticism, rectify the cooperatives, the party, and the youth league, improve the style of work of the cadres, overcome work shortcomings, and achieve the goals of improving party-mass relations and cadre-mass relations, purifying the party's ranks, consolidating the cooperatives, consolidating the policy of unified purchase and supply, and developing agricultural production.

The method of carrying out the socialist education campaign in the countryside must also be to let a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend, and to firmly trust the majority of the masses.

Currently, various methods are being adopted nationwide, but they are largely similar. The situation in each place is different, and there is no need to insist on uniformity. However, regardless of the method adopted, it should not hinder the letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend. Experience has proven that only by letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend can there be contention, and only through contention can the words and deeds of anti-socialist elements be exposed, right and wrong be clarified, and awareness be raised. What is particularly important is that only by letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend can the masses speak freely, criticize the shortcomings or mistakes of the cadres, expose the shortcomings in work, and make the cadres clear-headed, which is beneficial to improving work and raising the ideological and professional level of the cadres. At the same time, during the movement, the principle of "only speaking, not acting" must be adhered to, and simple and rough methods must be prevented and corrected.

In the peasants and other laboring people, the slogan of struggling against the rightists is not raised, and the "hat" of bourgeois rightist elements is not worn.

Materials from various places prove that there is a small number of class-alien elements, serious lawbreakers, and elements with serious capitalist tendencies among the county, district, and township cadres. To strengthen the leadership of the rural movement, to struggle against the above-mentioned elements, and to criticize various rightist tendencies, it is necessary to hold good three-level cadre meetings in each county. The three-level cadre meetings must also adopt the method of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend.

Counterrevolutionaries and bad elements in the countryside must be resolutely struck down to promote righteousness and suppress evil. Counterrevolutionaries and bad elements who have been sentenced to prison, if they commit crimes again after being released, must be arrested and sentenced again. Various criminals who disrupt public order and seriously violate laws and regulations, as well as those generally recognized as bad people, must be resolutely punished, and various superstitions must be resolutely banned. Currently, some personnel in the judicial and public security departments do not perform their duties and do not arrest and sentence those who should be arrested and sentenced. This is wrong. Light sentences for serious crimes are wrong, and heavy sentences for light crimes are also wrong. The current danger is in the latter. This tendency must be corrected under the leadership of the party committees at all levels.

The above principles also apply to cities.

In the countryside of various places, there are some "minor lawbreakers" who do not commit major crimes but often commit minor ones. If these people are handled by the local courts, it would be too troublesome, but if they are not handled, they would greatly disrupt production order and social order. It can be considered to have the representatives of the members of the cooperative or the people's representatives of the township formulate feasible regulations, approved by the higher-level government, to restrain them, and establish a mediation committee to be responsible for the implementation of the regulations. Those who violate these regulations can be authorized by the cooperative or the township government to give appropriate punishments. This is a method of self-education, self-supervision, and self-restraint by the masses, an important method for limiting individualism, changing old customs and habits, and forming new customs and habits in a socialist society. Not only in the countryside but also in cities, in factories, mines, organs, and schools, this can be tried. In cities, some hooligans who disrupt social order can also be sent to the countryside of their province, and the government can entrust cooperatives with conditions to manage their production. Regarding this aspect, it is suggested that the State Council study appropriate measures and submit them to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress for deliberation and decision.

For those who have had their "landlord and rich peasant" hats removed but are engaged in sabotage activities, the "hats" should be put back on.

For some well-off middle peasants with serious capitalist thoughts and behaviors, we must engage in reasoning and struggle, but they should not be treated the same as landlords, rich peasants, counterrevolutionaries, and bad elements. For well-off middle peasants, the issue is still one of unity, education, and transformation.

For individual farmers, they should not be discriminated against or mistreated, and we should strive to educate them to voluntarily join the cooperatives in succession. However, they should not be given better conditions than the cooperatives. They should, like cooperative members, bear all their obligations to the state.

For well-off middle peasants and individual farmers, in addition to political education, we should also take some economic measures to limit their capitalist spontaneous tendencies. For well-off middle peasants who demand to withdraw from the cooperative, we should, after a great debate and appropriate arrangements for some households with reduced income (with appropriate concessions), achieve the goal of most staying in the cooperative and a few leaving. For those who insist on withdrawing from the cooperative, we can, after criticizing their erroneous words and deeds and depriving them of their political influence, expel them from the cooperative. To limit the development of cooperative members towards the capitalist path, the scope of personal plots, personal reclamation, personal operation of sideline businesses, and free market activities in the countryside should be appropriately limited. For individual farmers, they should be strictly managed by the township government or by the township government entrusting the cooperative, not allowing them to have the "freedom" to engage in capitalist activities and sabotage the cooperative. Their illegal behaviors and harmful activities (such as undermining the "foundation" of the cooperative, employing workers to exploit, buying saplings, lending money at high interest, engaging in speculative trading, tax evasion, leasing land, etc.) must be limited or stopped. Enterprises and organs in the city should, when recruiting workers and temporary workers in the countryside, go through the introduction of the cooperative or sign a contract with the cooperative, and not allow the free recruitment of cooperative members and individual farmers. This will be regulated by the State Council.

Regarding how to combine the debate on the two roads, rectify the agricultural cooperatives, do a good job in the management of cooperative production, and implement the policy of mutual benefit, the Central Committee has issued three special instructions, which will not be repeated here. Here, it is only emphasized that the class line in the countryside still has decisive significance, and it is wrong to forget the class analysis and class line in the countryside. In the rectification of the cooperatives, it is necessary to ensure the advantage of the poor and lower-middle peasants, and the main cadres of the cooperatives should generally be poor and lower-middle peasants.

The cadres of the cooperatives must resolutely participate in productive labor. Now, many cooperatives have done this, and the influence is good, but there are still many cadres who are not enthusiastic and sufficient in this regard, and some even refuse to implement it, which needs to be continuously urged and implemented, and must be persistently adhered to.

The consolidation of the cooperative system is basically determined by the development of agricultural production. Only by developing production and increasing the income of the peasants can the superiority of cooperativization be demonstrated, which is a reliable guarantee for the victory of socialism in the struggle between the two roads. Only when the per-unit area yield of the cooperatives catches up with or exceeds the level of the well-off middle peasants in the locality can the wavering of the well-off middle peasants be stopped, and they can follow the socialist path.

China is a country with a population of more than 600 million, and the rural population accounts for more than 80% of the total population. If agriculture is not developed, it will not only affect the lives of the vast majority, affect the alliance between workers and peasants and the unity of the people but also will not be able to rapidly develop industry.

The draft of the forty articles for developing agricultural production formulated in January 1956 inspired morale and played a very good role. Now, the Central Committee, based on more than a year of experience, has made some revisions to the draft of the forty articles. It is proposed that the plenary session basically approves this draft so that it can be widely propagated and discussed nationwide. After the great debate on the two roads in the countryside, a great debate on agricultural production and construction should be carried out with the forty articles as the center, so as to promote the high tide of agricultural production and construction in the winter of this year and promote the cooperatives, with the active participation of the members, to formulate long-term plans for the development of agriculture in their cooperatives. After the nationwide discussion, the Central Committee will make another revision to this draft, go through the discussion of the party representatives' conference at the end of the year, and then submit it to the State Council for discussion and approval, and finally submit it to the National People's Congress for discussion and approval as a guideline for formulating agricultural plans and developing agricultural production in the next ten years.

To achieve the forty articles, it is not possible without a spirit, and it is not possible without constantly struggling against conservative tendencies. The great achievements of the production high tide in 1956 should be affirmed. These achievements exceed those of any year since liberation, and some projects even exceed the total of several years' achievements. Of course, there are also shortcomings, which should be well summarized, but we should not underestimate the great achievements because of some shortcomings. The agricultural production in 1957 has a good side, which is that the work is more solid, but there are also phenomena of insufficient effort in some places, which must be corrected.

Agriculture plays a very important role in China's socialist construction. Our goal of struggle is to build China into a modern industrial country and a modern agricultural country. While giving priority to the development of heavy industry, we must also vigorously develop agriculture. In the past few years, more propaganda has been done for industry, and a large number of cadres have been transferred to work in industry, which is necessary and has played an active role. However, propaganda for agriculture has been somewhat insufficient. Now, we should focus on propagating the importance of developing agriculture and changing the bad trends that have emerged in society in the past two years, such as looking down on agricultural production, peasants wanting to go to the city, urban people not wanting to go to the countryside, and people from the plains not wanting to go to the mountains.

Whether the forty articles can be achieved depends on the second five-year plan. Therefore, the whole party must strengthen the leadership of agriculture. In the future national construction, we must increase the investment in agricultural (including water conservancy) basic construction and do our best to develop the chemical fertilizer industry and other industries that can promote the development of agricultural production.

Within five years, the vast majority of cooperatives in the country must catch up with or exceed the production level of the well-off middle peasants in the locality, so that the income of the collective economy of the cooperatives, plus the income of the sideline businesses of the members' families, will, on average per person, catch up with or exceed the level of the well-off middle peasants in the locality. Currently, in the countryside, about 80% of the households have reached the general level of middle peasants before cooperativization, and among them, 20% to 30% have reached the level of well-off middle peasants. The households that are still poor generally account for about 15%. Therefore, it is completely possible to reach such a level within five years.

The rectification campaign and the struggle against the rightists, which began in May this year, were mainly conducted in party and government organs at the provincial and municipal levels, colleges and universities, democratic parties, the press and publishing industry, the scientific and technological community, the literary and artistic community, and the medical community until August. From August onwards, the campaign gradually expanded to workers, peasants, the industrial and commercial sectors, and primary and secondary school teachers and staff. The military also launched a rectification campaign. Now, it is expanding into a nationwide rectification movement.

Comrade Mao Zedong, at a meeting of some provincial and municipal party secretaries in Qingdao in July, made a comprehensive assessment of the nature and situation of the rectification campaign and the struggle against the rightists, and proposed clear guidelines for the development of the movement. Now, the movement across the country is proceeding smoothly according to the central guidelines.

The significance of this criticism of the bourgeois rightists should not be underestimated. It is a socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts. The socialist revolution in 1956 on the economic front (in terms of ownership of the means of production) is not enough and is not secure. The current nationwide debate is solving and will solve major issues such as whether the revolutionary and construction work is correct (whether the achievements of the revolution and construction are mainly positive), whether to follow the socialist path, whether to need the leadership of the Communist Party, whether to need the dictatorship of the proletariat, whether to need democratic centralism, and whether China's foreign policy is correct. If we cannot achieve complete victory in this debate, we will not be able to move forward. As long as we are victorious in the debate, it will greatly promote China's socialist transformation and socialist construction.

This movement aims to resolve two types of contradictions: those between enemies and those within the people. In China's socialist revolutionary period, the contradiction between the bourgeois rightists and the people is an antagonistic, irreconcilable, and life-or-death struggle. Urban and rural counterrevolutionaries, landlords and rich peasants who are still engaged in sabotage activities in rural areas, and social elements such as hooligans, gangsters, thieves, murderers, rapists, embezzlers, and serious criminals who disrupt social order and violate laws and regulations, as well as those generally recognized as bad elements, their contradictions with the people are also antagonistic. Apart from these, all other contradictions are within the people.

The rectification within the people also involves two different social categories. The bourgeoisie and bourgeois intellectuals need to be transformed into socialists; the petty bourgeoisie (peasants and urban and rural individual laborers), especially the well-off middle peasants, also need to be transformed into socialists. The working class and the basic forces of the Communist Party need to rectify their work style.

The purpose of the rectification campaign is to guide the direction of struggle towards rectifying political direction, raising ideological level, correcting work shortcomings, uniting the broad masses, and isolating and splitting the bourgeois rightists and all anti-socialist elements.

Against the enemy, we must wage a resolute struggle, using methods of exposure, isolation, and splitting, and in some cases, punishment and suppression. Within the people, we mainly use educational methods, the method of "unity-criticism-unity." Criminals among the people must also be dealt with legally, and such punishment also has an educational effect.

Over the past four months, the development of the movement has fully conformed to the analysis of the Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, fully proving the correctness of the central guidelines.

The movement has proven the necessity of waging a resolute struggle against the bourgeois rightists and various anti-socialist elements in urban and rural areas. Their attacks on the socialist path and the leadership of the Communist Party have been extremely rampant and vicious. They have a program, organization, and plan, and their goal is to restore capitalist and reactionary rule.

The movement has proven the necessity of continuing socialist transformation among the bourgeoisie and bourgeois intellectuals, and among the petty bourgeoisie, especially the well-off middle peasants. Many of them still yearn for capitalism and are unhappy with socialism. The leadership of the proletariat and the Communist Party over them is not yet consolidated. They are the market for the activities of rightists. However, the vast majority of them can accept socialism after criticism and education. We must make great efforts to unite and educate the middle elements, so as to isolate the rightists and strengthen the leftists.

The movement has proven the necessity of conducting a large-scale socialist education campaign among the working class and the poor and lower-middle peasants in rural areas. They are the most resolute forces in defending socialism. Conducting socialist education among them can arm them with better weapons for the struggle. In addition, a small number of them still have petty-bourgeois ideas and may be influenced by the bourgeoisie. However, as long as we seriously present facts and reason, they are very easy to understand.

The movement has proven the necessity of conducting a large-scale rectification campaign among the basic forces of the Communist Party and the leading organs and cadres of various levels of party, government, people's organizations, and enterprises. The party is basically healthy, and the vast majority of party members and cadres are good. However, from the mass outpouring of opinions, we have exposed a large number of shortcomings in our work and style, some of which are very serious and dangerous if not corrected. At the same time, there are a small number of rightists among the party members and youth league members, and a portion of them have serious rightist tendencies.

The movement has proven that in the struggle, we must firmly trust the majority of the masses and fully utilize the mass line. Implementing the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend, presenting facts, reasoning, posting big-character posters, holding symposiums and debates, is the broadest socialist democracy, which bourgeois democracy cannot even dream of. This is the method of correctly handling contradictions among the people, and it is also the method of educating and uniting the masses to struggle against the enemy. Letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend, we burn the enemy and also burn our own shortcomings. This is what we require. The facts have proven that those who dare not implement the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend, fearing trouble, do not believe in the awakening level of the majority of the masses, do not believe in the wisdom and strength of the masses, this rightist viewpoint is very harmful and has already been refuted by the facts.

The development of the movement is healthy and has achieved remarkable results. Especially in those units where the outpouring of opinions was thorough, and those that paid attention to correcting work shortcomings, the results are more remarkable. The overall situation of the movement's development is: the rightists are isolated and split, the middle elements are leaning to the left, and the strength of the leftists is increasing.

However, the movement must continue to deepen and expand, and we cannot end it hastily or tighten it in the front and loosen it in the back. We must strive for complete victory. In the organs at the central, provincial (municipal), prefectural, and county levels, the movement must go through four stages: the stage of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend (while carrying out rectification), the stage of counterattacking the rightists (while carrying out rectification), the stage of focusing on rectification (while continuing to let a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend), and the stage of studying documents, criticism and self-criticism, and raising one's own level. In units where the struggle against the rightists has achieved decisive victory, we should promptly shift to the third stage of focusing on rectification, while continuing to criticize bourgeois ideology systematically. Of course, the stages of development of the movement in some units may not be exactly the same as in the organs. For example, in rural areas, there is letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend, and there is a struggle against bad elements and a criticism of well-off middle peasants, but this is different from the struggle against the rightists in the organs. For peasants and workers, socialist education should be conducted, but only a small number of people need criticism and self-criticism, and it is not possible for them to study documents, criticize, and reflect like organ cadres. Workers, peasants, and students should continue to let a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend in the stage of focusing on rectification, supervising and helping leading cadres to rectify, but it is not that they themselves focus on rectification, which is said to the leading cadres. In addition, if rightists are discovered in the third and fourth stages, or if the original rightists have not yet surrendered, there is still the task of struggling against the rightists. Therefore, the four stages should not be taken too rigidly. In short, for leading cadres, these four stages must be gone through and thoroughly understood. The complete victory of the movement is not only determined by the stage of struggling against the rightists but is particularly determined by the third stage of focusing on rectification and the fourth stage of studying documents, criticism and self-criticism, and raising one's own level.

(2) On the bourgeoisie and intellectuals

This struggle against the rightists is mainly conducted among the bourgeoisie and intellectuals. This includes industrial and commercial people, democratic parties, the educational sector, the press and publishing industry, the literary and artistic community, the scientific and technological community, the medical community, many staff members of state organs, and university students. Intellectuals are not a class; they belong to different classes, but given the current situation in China, most intellectuals come from bourgeois and petty-bourgeois families and have received bourgeois education. Therefore, for convenience, they are discussed together with the bourgeoisie.

The elimination of the bourgeoisie is a fundamental issue of the socialist revolution. The bourgeoisie, especially its intellectuals, is currently the main force that can compete with the proletariat. They still have political positions, political capital, and political influence, while the proletariat also needs their knowledge. However, if they do not resolutely undergo socialist transformation, conflict with the proletariat is inevitable. The only way out for bourgeois intellectuals is to transform themselves and serve the socialist economic base; otherwise, they risk becoming "gentlemen of the rafters" who are neither in heaven nor on earth.

The party's policy towards bourgeois elements and intellectuals has been consistent. The party implements a policy of redemption towards bourgeois industrialists and merchants and strives to have them continue to serve socialism. The party implements the policy of long-term coexistence and mutual supervision towards the various democratic parties. The party advocates letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend in the field of academic culture. All these policies and guidelines are based on socialism. The party has always insisted that bourgeois elements and bourgeois intellectuals must undergo thorough transformation and gradually become proletarianized. The leadership of the party, the dictatorship of the proletariat, and democratic centralism are absolutely not to be shaken. The party's basic policies, such as the policy of eliminating counterrevolutionaries, the policy of cooperation, and the policy of unified purchase and supply of major agricultural products, are absolutely not to be shaken. The propaganda and political education of Marxism-Leninism must be strengthened, erroneous thoughts must be criticized, and "poisonous weeds" must be uprooted. The opening of "poisonous weeds" is for the purpose of educating the masses from the opposite side, for uprooting them to use as fertilizer, and for tempering the proletariat and the broad masses in the struggle. The party also points out that treating the contradictions between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie as contradictions within the people is conditional on the bourgeoisie accepting our guidelines, accepting socialist transformation and the leadership of the party; otherwise, it will turn into an antagonistic contradiction.

The bourgeoisie did not resist the socialist transformation of 1956 mainly because: (1) they had no other way out economically; (2) after the "Three Antis" and "Five Antis," most of them realized that opposing the proletariat was a dead end; (3) the government made appropriate arrangements for them economically and politically after their joint ventures. However, the change of ownership does not mean the completion of the socialist revolution, let alone the extinction of class struggle. The political and ideological struggle between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat has not ended and can become acute again under certain conditions. The recent attacks by the rightists on the Communist Party and socialism illustrate this point.

In the socialist revolution, the bourgeoisie and bourgeois intellectuals are divided into left, middle, and right factions. The left faction stands for supporting socialism and the leadership of the party. The right faction resolutely opposes socialism and the leadership of the party. The left and right factions are minorities among the bourgeoisie and bourgeois intellectuals, with the majority being the middle faction. The rightists always want to attack the Communist Party and socialism but wait for the opportunity. The rightists believe that the Hungarian incident, the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend, the propaganda of correctly handling contradictions within the people, and the party's rectification are their "opportunities."

Rightist elements are generally from exploiting classes. Historically, many of them have participated in reactionary parties and were rightists during the democratic revolution. However, history develops, and people change. Some rightists during the democratic revolution have now changed. Conversely, some who were middle or even left during the democratic revolution are now rightists. This shows that new political divisions are inevitable in the socialist revolution.

The main arena for the activities of rightist elements is where intellectuals gather, such as universities, certain state organs, press and publishing agencies, literary and artistic groups, legal and judicial sectors, scientific and technological sectors, and medical sectors. Intellectuals have undergone several movements in the past, and most have made different degrees of progress. A small number have already become leftists. Most people can now accept or do not oppose socialism, but many of them are imbued with bourgeois worldviews. It will take a considerable amount of time for them to truly become proletarian intellectuals. Due to the relatively weak proletarian intellectual force and the possibility of the middle faction following the rightists under certain conditions, the rightist intellectuals were particularly rampant in this attack.

Rightist elements in the various democratic parties played a key role in the rightist attack because the people gave them a certain political position, allowing them to issue orders and recruit followers legally. The democratic parties are products of the democratic revolution, and some members have become leftists in the socialist revolutionary period, but the majority have not yet shifted from the bourgeois stance to the proletarian stance. Therefore, the rightists once dominated many organizations within the democratic parties.

The various reactionary programs proposed by the bourgeois rightists in their attacks on the party are essentially anti-socialist and anti-party leadership. Their main political arguments are: (1) advocating the economic and political system of the bourgeoisie and bourgeois culture, opposing the economic and political system of socialism and socialist culture; (2) opposing the basic policies of the state, such as foreign policy, the policy of unified purchase and supply, the policy towards intellectuals, and the Five Great Movements; (3) denying the achievements of the people's democratic revolution, the socialist revolution, and socialist construction, and denying that the party and the proletariat can lead the construction of the state; (4) opposing the party's leadership of state work and the party's leadership in various departments (especially in the fields of education, science, and technology), demanding the abolition of the party's leadership in certain primary units (especially in universities and press and publishing agencies).

The main arguments of the rightists in the field of academic culture are: outsiders cannot lead insiders. Marxism is dogmatism. Socialist countries have no science and culture, and if they do, it is not as good as in capitalist countries. They demand the restoration of bourgeois sociology, economics, history, and idealist philosophy. They demand "independence" and "freedom" from the party and the people's government: "freedom of the press," "freedom of publication," "freedom of literature and art," etc.

The attack by the rightists shows that the majority of the bourgeoisie and bourgeois intellectuals are still not convinced by the leadership of the proletariat and the Communist Party. The Communist Party, of course, cannot have leadership in a part of the democratic parties, intellectual circles, and industrial and commercial circles (rightists) because they are enemies. In the majority (middle faction), the leadership is not consolidated, and some cultural and educational units have not yet established party leadership. The rightists are determined to compete with us. After the competition, they failed and realized that their days are numbered and there is no hope. Only at this time will the majority of the bourgeoisie and bourgeois intellectuals (middle faction and some rightists) gradually become honest, gradually abandon their bourgeois stance, and stand on the side of the proletariat, making up their minds to accept the leadership of the proletariat.

After more than three months of struggle, the situation has changed greatly. In various democratic parties, universities, other intellectual circles, and provincial and municipal organs, the struggle has generally achieved decisive victory.

The current task is to carry the struggle against the rightists to the end. To this end, we must continue to oppose rightist tendencies, but we must also guard against the dangers of an overly broad scope of attack and simple and rough methods. We must strictly grasp the boundaries between extreme rightists, rightists, and middle-rightists, and always pay attention to reviewing the list of rightists in the units. For those incorrectly classified, corrections must be made in a timely manner. We must pay special attention to the work of uniting the middle faction and to promoting the splitting of the rightists, helping those who have shown signs of repentance to gradually transform.

In units where the struggle against the rightists has reached a conclusion, we must resolutely and promptly shift to the stage of rectification and ideological education. Currently, many units lack the determination to shift to rectification, which should be corrected. The so-called conclusion of the struggle against the rightists means that all rightists have been exposed, criticized, and isolated, and that the majority of rightists have bowed their heads in front of the masses, not that all rightists' confessions and explanations have reached a thorough level. There will always be a part of the rightists who will not repent, taking their reactionary views to the grave, and the majority of rightists will not truly transform in a short period. However, as long as they are isolated among the masses, our struggle is victorious.

Bourgeois intellectuals, apart from a small number who hold rightist views, also have other serious erroneous views, especially individualism, liberalism, anarchism, egalitarianism, and nationalism. In the stage of ideological education and self-criticism, we must concentrate our efforts on systematically criticizing these erroneous views. This is one of the most important tasks to be completed in this rectification campaign.

The ideological transformation of intellectuals is a long-term task, which may take more than ten years. However, during this campaign, we must conduct extensive socialist education among the general bourgeois intellectuals and the industrial and commercial circles, destroy the strongholds of bourgeois ideology, fundamentally change the political face of many cultural and educational units and democratic parties, establish a consolidated leadership over the middle faction, and consolidate it as soon as possible.

We must greatly strengthen the leading cadres of the cultural and educational front and thoroughly rectify many cultural and educational organizations. To build socialism, the working class must have its own technical cadre force, its own professors, teachers, scientists, journalists, writers, artists, and Marxist theorists. This is a large force, and it is not enough to have a small number. The whole party must pay attention to cultivating revolutionary specialists. All party cadres who have the conditions must seriously study theory and business, work hard, and make themselves into "red and expert" red specialists. To achieve this goal, the central and local governments must formulate specific plans in the near future and implement them vigorously.

To cultivate the intellectual force of the working class, we must also use revolutionary spirit to cultivate new intellectuals, innovate and strengthen ideological and political education and labor education in schools, strengthen the work of cultivating intellectuals from among workers and peasants, and systematically recruit outstanding revolutionary intellectuals into the party.

The current several million intellectuals, although most of them are middle faction, are generally willing to progress. The working class's plan to cultivate its own intellectual force must include them. We must see that they are an important asset of the state, and the economic and cultural construction of socialism and the cultivation of new forces all need their efforts. Therefore, we must make great efforts to unite, win over, and educate them, correct their erroneous views, help them carry out self-transformation, and use appropriate rather than rough methods to gradually make them shed their middle status and stand on the side of the working class. We must, through rectification and the study of Marxism-Leninism, help them to go deep among the masses, get close to reality, and have more conversations and make more friends with them, listen to their suggestions on work, and help them solve difficulties in their work. The shortcomings we had in these aspects in the past must be overcome. The opinions raised by intellectuals during the outpouring of opinions are mostly correct and should be seriously studied and handled. The policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend in academic and cultural work must be implemented with a series of specific measures. Of course, this is a socialist policy, and implementing this policy must follow the six criteria proposed by Comrade Mao Zedong, to flourish socialist rather than capitalist academic culture.

In dealing with rightist elements, the principle should be to combine severity with leniency. Politically and ideologically, we must struggle thoroughly, but in handling, we should not be too harsh, so as to continue to split and transform the rightists. However, we should not be too lenient, confusing the boundaries between enemies and friends and between right and wrong. In this matter, we must pay attention to grasping the degree.

In the socialist revolutionary period, we need a new united front that serves socialism. We should, on the basis of the six criteria, implement the policy of long-term coexistence and mutual supervision. The view that the democratic parties have no further use is wrong. The central committees of various democratic parties have recently held national rectification work conferences, and we should help them, while continuing to deepen the struggle at the central and provincial and municipal levels, to actively and step-by-step deepen the struggle into all grassroots organizations, and then shift to general rectification, abandoning the capitalist stance and taking the socialist stance.

The method of rectification for the backbone of the industrial and commercial circles is generally the same as that for the various democratic parties. General bourgeois elements, according to different situations, either participate in the rectification of the backbone of the industrial and commercial circles or form separate groups for rectification. For the activities of capitalist elements among the capitalists to resist socialist transformation and the infiltration of their ideology into the thoughts of the working masses, we must expose and criticize them. For their serious illegal activities, we must struggle, so as to educate the majority and consolidate the socialist position. "Underground factories" must be prohibited and turned into above-ground ones for management, supervision, and transformation. Small industrial and commercial operators should mainly conduct socialist education, and when possible, organize debates, similar to the rectification methods among workers and peasants. Those who have serious illegal activities should also be exposed and struggled against. In short, we must make all people in the industrial and commercial circles receive education and not forget a part of them (mainly small industrial and commercial operators) as in some past movements.

(3) On the countryside

The overall situation in the countryside is good: the cooperatives are basically consolidated, grain production has increased, and the style of work of the cadres has improved. However, due to the short time of running the cooperatives, lack of experience, and severe disasters, there are still difficulties and shortcomings.

The realization of cooperativization has basically solved the problem of ownership of the means of production, but this does not mean that there are no problems in the countryside.

Some peasants still have unclear understanding of the relationship between the state, the cooperative, and the family, and there are individualistic and parochial thoughts that do not consider the interests of the state and the collective. In the issue of unified purchase and supply, the contradictions between the well-off peasants and the state are more prominent, and many of them use various means to sell less surplus grain and other major agricultural products, and some even engage in speculation. Especially after the opening of the free market, the capitalist spontaneous tendencies of some peasants have resurfaced.

The vast majority of well-off middle peasants have joined the cooperatives due to the trend of the times, but most of them are still wavering in their thoughts. A few who insist on the capitalist road either, after being forced to join the cooperative, lead the disruption and demand to withdraw from the cooperative; or outside the cooperative, engage in activities to sabotage the cooperative. They always want to compete with the cooperative. In addition, they are also the main force resisting the policy of unified purchase and supply and engaging in grain speculation in the countryside.

Counterrevolutionaries, bad elements, and some landlords and rich peasants also seize the opportunity to engage in sabotage activities: spreading reactionary speeches, spreading rumors, promoting superstition, gambling, reversing accounts, inciting trouble, and even establishing counterrevolutionary organizations and causing riots.

Within the party, there has been a serious rightist tendency in the recent period: believing that the struggle between the two roads in the countryside has ended and that it is not necessary to emphasize the class line; that it is possible to focus on production and relax socialist education for the peasants. Being complacent about the sabotage activities of reactionaries and not giving them a timely and powerful blow. Among the rural cadres, there are also a few who, due to changes in their family economic status, have developed capitalist thoughts. These people, on basic issues such as cooperativization and unified purchase and supply, actually stand on the side of the well-off middle peasants and express doubts and dissatisfaction with the policies of the party and the state.

From this, it can be seen that, like in the cities, there is still a struggle between socialism and capitalism in the countryside. This struggle will take a long time to achieve a thorough victory. This is a task for the entire transitional period.

The socialist education campaign currently being carried out in the countryside aims to: (1) clarify right and wrong in the great debate and firmly believe in and decide to follow the socialist path; (2) criticize the capitalist and individualistic thoughts of the well-off middle peasants and overcome the capitalist influence in the countryside; (3) expose and strike at the sabotage activities of landlords, rich peasants, counterrevolutionaries, and other bad elements; (4) on the basis of mass criticism and self-criticism, rectify the cooperatives, the party, and the youth league, improve the style of work of the cadres, overcome work shortcomings, and achieve the goals of improving party-mass relations and cadre-mass relations, purifying the party's ranks, consolidating the cooperatives, consolidating the policy of unified purchase and supply, and developing agricultural production.

The method of carrying out the socialist education campaign in the countryside must also be to let a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend, and to firmly trust the majority of the masses.

Currently, various methods are being adopted nationwide, but they are largely similar. The situation in each place is different, and there is no need to insist on uniformity. However, regardless of the method adopted, it should not hinder the letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend. Experience has proven that only by letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend can there be contention, and only through contention can the words and deeds of anti-socialist elements be exposed, right and wrong be clarified, and awareness be raised. What is particularly important is that only by letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend can the masses speak freely, criticize the shortcomings or mistakes of the cadres, expose the shortcomings in work, and make the cadres clear-headed, which is beneficial to improving work and raising the ideological and professional level of the cadres. At the same time, during the movement, the principle of "only speaking, not acting" must be adhered to, and simple and rough methods must be prevented and corrected.

In the peasants and other laboring people, the slogan of struggling against the rightists is not raised, and the "hat" of bourgeois rightist elements is not worn.

Materials from various places prove that there is a small number of class-alien elements, serious lawbreakers, and elements with serious capitalist tendencies among the county, district, and township cadres. To strengthen the leadership of the rural movement, to struggle against the above-mentioned elements, and to criticize various rightist tendencies, it is necessary to hold good three-level cadre meetings in each county. The three-level cadre meetings must also adopt the method of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend.

Counterrevolutionaries and bad elements in the countryside must be resolutely struck down to promote righteousness and suppress evil. Counterrevolutionaries and bad elements who have been sentenced to prison, if they commit crimes again after being released, must be arrested and sentenced again. Various criminals who disrupt public order and seriously violate laws and regulations, as well as those generally recognized as bad people, must be resolutely punished, and various superstitions must be resolutely banned. Currently, some personnel in the judicial and public security departments do not perform their duties and do not arrest and sentence those who should be arrested and sentenced. This is wrong. Light sentences for serious crimes are wrong, and heavy sentences for light crimes are also wrong. The current danger is in the latter. This tendency must be corrected under the leadership of the party committees at all levels.

The above principles also apply to cities.

In the countryside of various places, there are some "minor lawbreakers" who do not commit major crimes but often commit minor ones. If these people are handled by the local courts, it would be too troublesome, but if they are not handled, they would greatly disrupt production order and social order. It can be considered to have the representatives of the members of the cooperative or the people's representatives of the township formulate feasible regulations, approved by the higher-level government, to restrain them, and establish a mediation committee to be responsible for the implementation of the regulations. Those who violate these regulations can be authorized by the cooperative or the township government to give appropriate punishments. This is a method of self-education, self-supervision, and self-restraint by the masses, an important method for limiting individualism, changing old customs and habits, and forming new customs and habits in a socialist society. Not only in the countryside but also in cities, in factories, mines, organs, and schools, this can be tried. In cities, some hooligans who disrupt social order can also be sent to the countryside of their province, and the government can entrust cooperatives with conditions to manage their production. Regarding this aspect, it is suggested that the State Council study appropriate measures and submit them to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress for deliberation and decision.

For those who have had their "landlord and rich peasant" hats removed but are engaged in sabotage activities, the "hats" should be put back on.

For some well-off middle peasants with serious capitalist thoughts and behaviors, we must engage in reasoning and struggle, but they should not be treated the same as landlords, rich peasants, counterrevolutionaries, and bad elements. For well-off middle peasants, the issue is still one of unity, education, and transformation.

For individual farmers, they should not be discriminated against or mistreated, and we should strive to educate them to voluntarily join the cooperatives in succession. However, they should not be given better conditions than the cooperatives. They should, like cooperative members, bear all their obligations to the state.

For well-off middle peasants and individual farmers, in addition to political education, we should also take some economic measures to limit their capitalist spontaneous tendencies. For well-off middle peasants who demand to withdraw from the cooperative, we should, after a great debate and appropriate arrangements for some households with reduced income (with appropriate concessions), achieve the goal of most staying in the cooperative and a few leaving. For those who insist on withdrawing from the cooperative, we can, after criticizing their erroneous words and deeds and depriving them of their political influence, expel them from the cooperative. To limit the development of cooperative members towards the capitalist path, the scope of personal plots, personal reclamation, personal operation of sideline businesses, and free market activities in the countryside should be appropriately limited. For individual farmers, they should be strictly managed by the township government or by the township government entrusting the cooperative, not allowing them to have the "freedom" to engage in capitalist activities and sabotage the cooperative. Their illegal behaviors and harmful activities (such as undermining the "foundation" of the cooperative, employing workers to exploit, buying saplings, lending money at high interest, engaging in speculative trading, tax evasion, leasing land, etc.) must be limited or stopped. Enterprises and organs in the city should, when recruiting workers and temporary workers in the countryside, go through the introduction of the cooperative or sign a contract with the cooperative, and not allow the free recruitment of cooperative members and individual farmers. This will be regulated by the State Council.

Regarding how to combine the debate on the two roads, rectify the agricultural cooperatives, do a good job in the management of cooperative production, and implement the policy of mutual benefit, the Central Committee has issued three special instructions, which will not be repeated here. Here, it is only emphasized that the class line in the countryside still has decisive significance, and it is wrong to forget the class analysis and class line in the countryside. In the rectification of the cooperatives, it is necessary to ensure the advantage of the poor and lower-middle peasants, and the main cadres of the cooperatives should generally be poor and lower-middle peasants.

The cadres of the cooperatives must resolutely participate in productive labor. Now, many cooperatives have done this, and the influence is good, but there are still many cadres who are not enthusiastic and sufficient in this regard, and some even refuse to implement it, which needs to be continuously urged and implemented, and must be persistently adhered to.

The consolidation of the cooperative system is basically determined by the development of agricultural production. Only by developing production and increasing the income of the peasants can the superiority of cooperativization be demonstrated, which is a reliable guarantee for the victory of socialism in the struggle between the two roads. Only when the per-unit area yield of the cooperatives catches up with or exceeds the level of the well-off middle peasants in the locality can the wavering of the well-off middle peasants be stopped, and they can follow the socialist path.

China is a country with a population of more than 600 million, and the rural population accounts for more than 80% of the total population. If agriculture is not developed, it will not only affect the lives of the vast majority, affect the alliance between workers and peasants and the unity of the people but also will not be able to rapidly develop industry.

The draft of the forty articles for developing agricultural production formulated in January 1956 inspired morale and played a very good role. Now, the Central Committee, based on more than a year of experience, has made some revisions to the draft of the forty articles. It is proposed that the plenary session basically approves this draft so that it can be widely propagated and discussed nationwide. After the great debate on the two roads in the countryside, a great debate on agricultural production and construction should be carried out with the forty articles as the center, so as to promote the high tide of agricultural production and construction in the winter of this year and promote the cooperatives, with the active participation of the members, to formulate long-term plans for the development of agriculture in their cooperatives. After the nationwide discussion, the Central Committee will make another revision to this draft, go through the discussion of the party representatives' conference at the end of the year, and then submit it to the State Council for discussion and approval, and finally submit it to the National People's Congress for discussion and approval as a guideline for formulating agricultural plans and developing agricultural production in the next ten years.

To achieve the forty articles, it is not possible without a spirit, and it is not possible without constantly struggling against conservative tendencies. The great achievements of the production high tide in 1956 should be affirmed. These achievements exceed those of any year since liberation, and some projects even exceed the total of several years' achievements. Of course, there are also shortcomings, which should be well summarized, but we should not underestimate the great achievements because of some shortcomings. The agricultural production in 1957 has a good side, which is that the work is more solid, but there are also phenomena of insufficient effort in some places, which must be corrected.

Agriculture plays a very important role in China's socialist construction. Our goal of struggle is to build China into a modern industrial country and a modern agricultural country. While giving priority to the development of heavy industry, we must also vigorously develop agriculture. In the past few years, more propaganda has been done for industry, and a large number of cadres have been transferred to work in industry, which is necessary and has played an active role. However, propaganda for agriculture has been somewhat insufficient. Now, we should focus on propagating the importance of developing agriculture and changing the bad trends that have emerged in society in the past two years, such as looking down on agricultural production, peasants wanting to go to the city, urban people not wanting to go to the countryside, and people from the plains not wanting to go to the mountains.

Whether the forty articles can be achieved depends on the second five-year plan. Therefore, the whole party must strengthen the leadership of agriculture. In the future national construction, we must increase the investment in agricultural (including water conservancy) basic construction and do our best to develop the chemical fertilizer industry and other industries that can promote the development of agricultural production.

Within five years, the vast majority of cooperatives in the country must catch up with or exceed the production level of the well-off middle peasants in the locality, so that the income of the collective economy of the cooperatives, plus the income of the sideline businesses of the members' families, will, on average per person, catch up with or exceed the level of the well-off middle peasants in the locality. Currently, in the countryside, about 80% of the households have reached the general level of middle peasants before cooperativization, and among them, 20% to 30% have reached the level of well-off middle peasants. The households that are still poor generally account for about 15%. Therefore, it is completely possible to reach such a level within five years.

In the context of increased income for community members, it is essential to maximize the public accumulation of the cooperative. Relying on the cooperative's own strength to gradually increase basic construction is not only a reliable path to developing production and increasing income but also a material foundation for consolidating the socialist system (cooperative). With more public property, the cooperative will be as solid as reinforced concrete; otherwise, it will be as fragile as a pile of sand.

With the increase in farmers' income and improvement in living standards, it is important to advocate for thrift and frugality. The money saved should be invested in agricultural cooperatives or deposited in banks and credit unions. Grain should also be conserved. Apart from fulfilling and exceeding the state's procurement tasks, agricultural cooperatives and households should also store grain for emergencies.

This winter and next spring, efforts should be made to launch a large-scale campaign for fertilizer accumulation and agricultural water conservancy construction, as well as other basic construction projects as appropriate. The central government and the State Council have issued specific instructions on this matter. Local authorities can formulate specific targets and plans based on their unique circumstances.

All production increase measures of the cooperative must fully utilize the mass line and implement the principle of democratic management. It is important to use persuasive methods to inspire the masses' enthusiasm and to carry out various productive endeavors and resolve cooperative issues. It is necessary to recognize that even if the advocated measures are completely correct and largely successful, without serious discussion and decision-making by the masses, there will still be dissatisfaction; and in fact, there will always be some failures or poor results, which will be even more difficult to avoid if not discussed by the masses. However, as long as everything is done through the masses, even if there are losses, it will be a collective responsibility, and everyone will learn from it, which is beneficial for unity and correction. This point must be emphasized to educate grassroots cadres.

(IV) Regarding the Working Class

The rectification of the working class is a matter of rectifying the ideological style and raising class consciousness, which has fundamental differences from the socialist transformation of the bourgeoisie, bourgeois intellectuals, and petty bourgeoisie. Therefore, it is necessary to focus on improving work and conducting socialist education for the masses, rather than applying the methods used for bourgeois intellectuals in institutions and schools to the general working-class masses.

Currently, the organizational and ideological state of the working class is generally good. Among the more than 11 million industrial workers, about 85% come from working-class and other laboring families, about 35% are old workers from before liberation, and about 13% are Communist Party members (including 29% who are Communist Youth League members).

However, a specific analysis of the working class situation is necessary. Past movements have shown that old workers are the basic reliance of the Party and the socialist cause. Among the 65% of new workers, more than half come from peasant, student, and urban poor backgrounds, and their petty-bourgeois ideological style is relatively strong. Additionally, about 3% (and in some units, more than 5%) of new workers are former landlords, rich peasants, capitalists, pseudo-military and police, and vagrant elements, whose exploitative class consciousness and bad habits have not been adequately transformed.

Therefore, it is necessary to conduct a comprehensive and in-depth socialist education campaign during the rectification to better establish and cultivate the backbone and core strength of the working-class ranks. It is necessary to further investigate and clean up bad elements to purify the working-class ranks. Through rectification and socialist education, the working class should be forged into a conscious, organized, and disciplined fighting force.

The central content of education should be about the leading role and responsibilities of the working class in the socialist revolution and construction, and the political tasks of the working people under the dictatorship of the proletariat. It is necessary to make the working people understand that they must, under the leadership of the Communist Party, continuously raise their consciousness, strengthen their organizational discipline, and enhance internal class unity; they must carry forward the fine tradition of hard struggle, maintain the noble quality of selflessness, work hard, be thrifty, and use their model role to lead the people of the whole country to struggle for the completion of socialist construction.

In some factories where new workers predominate, it is necessary to focus on solving the problem of transforming the standpoint of new workers. It is completely necessary to clearly propose the task of ideological transformation among all new workers.

It is necessary to combine the workers' personal life experiences and the main issues they raise, as well as the state's political and economic life and the specific situation of the enterprise, to propose discussion topics. Generally, the following can be discussed: (1) how the working class should assume the responsibilities of the leading class; (2) the relationship between the individual and the collective, the individual and the state; (3) the relationship between improved living standards and production development; (4) the relationship between freedom and discipline, democracy and centralization; (5) the relationship between workers and peasants (mainly discussing that the living standards of workers should not be too high compared to peasants). Through discussions on these issues, prepare ideologically for improving the wage and welfare system.

In the workplace, it is important to fully utilize large-character posters. Large-character posters are simple, lively, and attention-grabbing, making it easy to mobilize the masses; they clearly and sharply criticize the shortcomings of leaders and workers, propose various rationalization suggestions, and are vivid and colorful. Whether in factories or institutions and schools, large-character posters can gradually become an important form of continuous criticism and self-criticism.

In factories, rectification and socialist education to transform the ideology of new workers should mainly rely on old workers and those with longer work experience and more political education. It is necessary to fully utilize the active role of old workers, using their rich production and life experience, their class consciousness, their organizational discipline, to unite and educate new workers, especially young workers. In recent years, some cadres have somewhat neglected the role of old workers, and in certain policy measures, such as promotions, piecework wages, job assignments, labor insurance, and children's employment, they have not adequately taken care of old workers, which needs to be improved.

Leaders must seriously rectify their work style and improve their work. From beginning to end, they must implement the policy of rectifying while improving. It is necessary to check and overcome bureaucratism, subjectivism, and sectarianism. Leaders (including Party, government, trade unions, and youth leagues) participating in physical labor should become a regular practice. It is necessary to seize every possible opportunity to study technology and business, gradually transforming from outsiders to insiders. It is necessary to delve into production, delve into the lives of workers, care about the people's hardships, live with the workers, and resolutely abolish the special treatment of being detached from the masses. It is necessary to help and guide section-level cadres to overcome commandism, making them both responsible and capable of following the mass line.

It is necessary to vigorously streamline the organization, reduce the number of Party, government, trade union, and youth league personnel, and reduce the excessive number of non-production personnel in enterprises. It is necessary to pay attention to cultivating and growing cadres from among the workers, fully utilizing the active role of non-full-time and part-time activists and cadres. It is necessary to emphasize the combination of technical personnel and staff with workers, organizing them to participate in practical operations, so as to cultivate a large number of excellent cadres who have both practical experience and close ties with the masses.

For various regulations and systems that affect production, affect unity, and hinder the development of workers' initiative, it is necessary to resolutely modify or abolish them. At the same time, it is necessary to establish necessary new management systems and political education work systems to consolidate the achievements of rectification institutionally.

The workers' congress under the leadership of the Party committee is a good form of expanding enterprise democracy, attracting workers to participate in enterprise management, and overcoming bureaucratism. It is an effective method for correctly handling contradictions among the people, and it should be fully utilized in this rectification and promoted nationwide after summarizing the experience of pilot projects.

The powers of the workers' congress should follow the central government's regulations, which are: (1) to listen to and discuss the factory director's work report, review and discuss the enterprise's production plan, financial plan, technical plan, labor and wage plan, and important measures to implement these plans, and regularly check the implementation of the plans and make suggestions; (2) to review and discuss the enterprise's bonus fund, welfare fund, medical fund, labor protection allocation, trade union fund, and other funds related to workers' living and welfare, and within the scope of not violating the instructions and orders of higher authorities, make resolutions within the above scope and hand them over to the enterprise administrative department or other relevant parties to implement; (3) when necessary, recommend to higher authorities the removal of certain enterprise leaders; (4) when there are different opinions about the regulations of higher authorities, make suggestions to higher authorities. However, if higher authorities, after research, still insist on the original decision, it must be implemented.

Most of the technical personnel and staff in enterprises still belong to the category of bourgeois intellectuals. Rectification is mainly about making them accept socialist transformation, and generally, it can be done in a similar way to the rectification of institutions and schools. However, because they directly participate in production and construction and are relatively close to workers, they are different from high-level intellectuals in institutions and schools. Therefore, they should be treated differently according to different objects and specific circumstances, and simple methods should not be used.

For the extremely few anti-socialist elements among workers, and for hooligans, thugs, and seriously lawless and disorderly elements, it is necessary to criticize and appropriately struggle against them. In cases of particularly serious situations or repeated offenses, they should be expelled from the factory and appropriately dealt with after the movement ends. However, for: (1) those with backward ideas, strange talk, loose labor discipline, or dissatisfaction with leaders due to work and life problems; (2) those with regionalism, localism, and sectarian sentiments; (3) general troublemakers, etc., they should not be indiscriminately regarded as political anti-socialist elements and bad elements and struggled against and suppressed. It is necessary to pay special attention to preventing retaliation and preventing factional struggles.

For old workers and demobilized soldiers, it is necessary to handle problems with special care.

The rectification of handicraft and transportation cooperatives should be combined with the rectification of cooperatives. It is necessary to fully mobilize the enthusiasm of workers and poor independent laborers to take the socialist path, pay attention to uniting relatively wealthy and skilled cooperative members, expose and criticize the capitalist tendencies of the original small business owners and some wealthy independent laborers, and stop their destructive activities. On the basis of a victorious great debate and the rectification of cadres, consolidate the cooperatives.

The families of workers and other urban laborers should also, under the unified leadership of the local Party committee, carry out a comprehensive socialist education campaign, mobilize as many people as possible to speak out, and conduct debates to clarify major issues.

(V) Regarding Minority Nationalities

In all minority nationality regions that have basically completed the socialist transformation of the means of production, and among the minority nationality populations, it is necessary to carry out socialist education and appropriately conduct anti-rightist struggles.

In addition to the same content as in Han nationality regions, socialist education and anti-rightist struggles among minority nationalities should focus on opposing nationalist tendencies. Among the broad masses, it is necessary to use the method of contrasting old and new to propagate the interests and necessity of the unity and solidarity of all nationalities in the family of the Chinese people under the leadership of the Communist Party and the Central People's Government, and to expose the activities of bad elements that disrupt national unity. Among minority nationality cadres and upper-class figures, it is necessary to point out that local nationalism and Han chauvinism are both bourgeois anti-socialist tendencies, and they are equally dangerous to the solidarity and unity of the socialist motherland's nationalities. In the past, we emphasized opposing Han chauvinism among Han nationality cadres, which was completely necessary, and we will continue to firmly oppose Han chauvinism in the future. However, at present, it is equally necessary to emphasize opposing local nationalist tendencies among minority nationality cadres. It is necessary to recognize that all those who use narrow national sentiments and certain historical legacies of national estrangement to split national unity and disrupt national unity are in violation of our country's constitution and harmful to our country's socialist cause, and they are anti-socialist rightists. For those who openly incite national separatism and are particularly vicious, it is necessary to resolutely expose and refute them, making them completely isolated, thereby educating the masses and cadres.

The key to conducting anti-nationalist socialist education among minority nationalities lies in the Party organizations in minority nationality regions. Only by forming a truly proletarian-conscious communist core among all nationalities can the bourgeois nationalist tendencies of one's own nationality be overcome, and national unity and solidarity be consolidated. Party members of all nationalities must understand that nationalism is an important aspect of bourgeois ideology, which is fundamentally incompatible with the proletarian worldview, and it is a Marxist-Leninist and anti-communist ideology that must not be allowed to exist within the Communist Party. Therefore, in the Party organizations of all minority nationality regions, it is necessary to formulate plans to conduct education against bourgeois nationalism and, according to specific conditions, criticize the prominent nationalist tendencies among certain Party members of one's own nationality.

The political education policy of schools that cultivate minority nationality cadres should be changed. In the future, it is necessary to focus on class education and Marxist-Leninist national views, establishing students' communist worldview and outlook on life.

The complete resolution of the national question is a long-term process, so the criticism of nationalist tendencies must prevent impatience, must be conducted cautiously and in an orderly manner from top to bottom, and must gain the support of the majority of Party members and cadres and non-Party activists of one's own nationality. Han nationality cadres should continue to pay attention to checking and criticizing Han chauvinism, while local nationality cadres should focus on checking and criticizing local nationalism. Only by constantly opposing bourgeois nationalism (including Han nationalism and local nationalism) can the awareness of Party members and the masses of all nationalities be continuously raised, and the unity and solidarity of all nationalities be consolidated and strengthened.

In regions where democratic reforms have been completed but socialist transformation has not been carried out, it is not necessary to conduct anti-rightist struggles in society, but it is possible to conduct socialist education in appropriate scope and manner.

(VI) Regarding the Military

In the military, after the anti-rightist struggle, a few rightists have been exposed in the military system, which is of great significance to the consolidation of the military. However, the military is generally pure, so after the end of the anti-rightist struggle, it is necessary to focus on internal rectification, with cadres as the key.

In recent years of major social changes, the political and ideological state of military cadres is basically healthy. However, due to the peaceful environment, the influx of a large number of new elements into the military, and some cadres improperly emphasizing professionalism and neglecting ideological and political work, in recent years, individualism and lack of organization and discipline among cadres have developed to some extent. Some cadres think that the revolution has been successful, they have merits, and should be rewarded. They do not diligently complete tasks but pursue fame, position, and treatment, calculate personal gains and losses, and do not want to work in harsh areas. The military also has some shortcomings in relations between soldiers and officers, between superiors and subordinates, and between the military and the people that need to be overcome. The military has insufficient contact with local Party and government organizations, and there is a lack of regular study and education on policies related to socialist transformation and socialist construction. Some cadres and soldiers still have incorrect views on many issues in current rural work.

The above problems must be seriously resolved through rectification and socialist education.

In the rectification of various levels of military organizations and schools, it is possible to adopt the methods of large-character posters, debates, criticism, and self-criticism. In the platoons, it is mainly to conduct socialist education and organize debates under leadership.

The military is responsible for heavy tasks such as national defense and training, so during the rectification period, it is necessary to pay attention to not relaxing defense preparedness and training work, especially in frontline troops. The purpose of rectification must be to raise socialist consciousness, enhance military unity, enhance discipline, and enhance combat effectiveness, rather than the opposite.

(VII) Regarding the Party and the Youth League

Currently, our Party has 12.72 million members (including 2.8 million probationary members). Among them, there are more than 1.74 million worker Party members, more than 8.5 million peasant Party members, 1.88 million intellectual Party members, and 600,000 Party members of other backgrounds.

In this rectification movement and anti-rightist struggle, the majority of Party members have performed well. However, many problems have been exposed.

The movement has exposed a large number of phenomena of bureaucratism, sectarianism, and subjectivism. Some Party members have serious bourgeois individualism, pursuing personal enjoyment and calculating fame and position. There are also a few Party members who have lost revolutionary will, even to the point of degeneration and corruption, violating laws and discipline.

In the movement, rightist elements within the Party have been exposed. The discovery of these bourgeois spokesmen within the Party is of great significance to the consolidation and purity of our Party. In addition, there are some Party members with serious rightist ideas, serious dissatisfaction with the Party, and disagreements with the Party on major policy issues, and they have shown political vacillation in this struggle.

The serious problems within the Party have their social and ideological roots: (1) most Party members are not of proletarian origin; (2) the Party's organization has developed rapidly, with insufficient attention to quality, and ideological and political work has not kept up; (3) more importantly, most Party members joined the Party in a post-victory environment, lacking genuine socialist consciousness when they joined, and for a long time, they have been in an environment of cooperation with the bourgeoisie, without undergoing direct and sharp class struggle. Among the 1.88 million intellectual Party members, most have not undergone the tempering of productive labor and have not undergone the test of serious class struggle.

In the anti-rightist struggle, it is necessary to treat rightist elements within the Party as seriously as rightist elements outside the Party. However, there are still some comrades who, in the struggle against rightist elements within the Party, have shown relatively serious sentimentality, especially for some old Party members who should be labeled as rightists, they feel more regretful, soft-hearted, and unable to act. This sentiment must be overcome.

After the movement enters the third and fourth stages, it is even more necessary to grasp the task of rectification within the Party than outside the Party. In addition to the errors of bureaucratism, subjectivism, and sectarianism (including localism and parochialism) of leading cadres that must be seriously corrected, it is also necessary to criticize rightist ideas and various bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideas among ordinary Party members.

It is necessary to strengthen ideological and political education work. In this rectification, it is necessary to conduct a comprehensive ideological and political examination of every Party member. Seriously correct the neglect of ideological and political education, the lack of organizational life, and the laxity of discipline.

Except for traitors and serious lawless and disorderly elements, in the rectification, it is necessary to cherish all Party and Youth League members, using great effort and sincerity to help them correct their mistakes and shortcomings, improve their work methods, enhance their work abilities, and raise their ideological and political levels. Educate Party members and cadres to definitely have vitality, definitely have revolutionary will, definitely have the spirit of selflessness and wholeheartedly serving the people.

It is necessary to combine this rectification movement with a thorough rectification of all Party's grassroots organizations. Through this rectification movement, the goal is to purify the Party's ranks and consolidate the Party's organization.

For rightist elements within the Party, it is necessary to expel them from the Party. If they are not expelled because of lighter offenses and better transformation, their rightist "hat" can be removed.

For various bad elements that have infiltrated the Party, serious lawless and disorderly elements, incorrigible degenerate elements, those with serious bourgeois individualist ideas and behavior, and those who are incorrigible, it is necessary to expel them from the Party.

For those who have lost revolutionary will, do not play the role of a Communist, and do not correct their mistakes even after criticism and education, it is necessary to persuade them to leave the Party or expel them from the Party.

When deciding to expel a Party member, it is necessary to verify the facts of their mistakes, follow the prescribed procedures, and after expelling them, continue to care for them ideologically and politically, assign someone to maintain contact with them, and conduct supervision and education.

For probationary Party members, it is necessary to strengthen education and conduct strict examinations to prevent those who do not meet the conditions of a Party member from becoming formal Party members.

To continuously adjust the composition of Party members and supplement the Party with fresh blood, on the basis of the rectification movement and the anti-rightist struggle, and under the condition of ensuring the quality of Party members, it is possible to control the recruitment of those who truly meet the conditions of Party members, especially outstanding workers and outstanding intellectuals, as Party members.

The rectification movement and the anti-rightist struggle have tested every Party member, especially every cadre. Here, it is necessary to talk about the issue of Party cadre work.

Our Party has always paid attention to selecting outstanding workers and peasants and intellectuals who have close ties with workers and peasants to take on various leadership positions. This is our Party's cadre work line.

In a previous period, we recruited a batch of young intellectuals who had not undergone the tempering of productive labor and practical struggle tests to work in various levels of leadership organizations, which was a shortcoming.

In the future, we should still select cadres from outstanding workers and peasants, but they should be workers and peasants with a certain level of culture. Similarly, we should select cadres from outstanding intellectuals, but they should be intellectuals who have undergone the tempering of production and struggle and have close ties with the masses of workers and peasants. For the current intellectual cadres who have not undergone practical struggle and lack experience in grassroots work, it is necessary to organize them in batches to go to rural areas and factories to work for a few years or to do practical work at the grassroots level for a few years. All Party, government, and mass organization cadres at all levels must undergo the tempering of practical struggle and gain grassroots work experience. Those who lack this experience must make up for it. Literary, artistic, journalistic, theoretical workers, and other propaganda workers must also do the same.

For university and secondary specialized school graduates, it is necessary to study appropriate methods, first assigning them to production units suitable for their majors to engage in one to several years of labor, and then, based on their specialties and performance in labor, assigning their work.

It is necessary to seriously create conditions to enable physical laborers in production to have the opportunity to improve their cultural and scientific knowledge, and for those who can further their studies, to have the opportunity to enter higher education institutions.

Seriously implementing such a cadre work line can only establish the cadre work of the Party and the state on a solid foundation, and can only build a cadre force that is dedicated to the cause of communism and can withstand risks.

Regarding the issue of localizing cadres, it is one of the issues that must be correctly resolved in Party cadre work. There are some confused views on this issue that need to be clarified.

At the beginning of national liberation, the central government proposed relying on the army and relying on cadres from old liberated areas to establish work in new liberated areas, which was completely correct. Now, most of these cadres are working well and have established ties with local people, that is, they have already localized and should continue to work. A few people have difficulties continuing to work or have poor performance and should be encouraged to return to their original places of origin or work areas to engage in production or make other appropriate arrangements. Each locality should promote a certain number of local cadres to work, which has been done and should continue to be done. Now, in most places, the relationship between outsider cadres and local cadres is harmonious and normal. However, some comrades lack a correct understanding of localizing cadres, and some even have the sentiment of excluding outsider cadres. This is a manifestation of erroneous localism, which should be corrected in this rectification.

It must be pointed out that localizing cadres is not the highest principle of the Party's cadre policy. The highest principle of cadre policy is first and foremost communism. Whether outsider cadres or local cadres, they must first be communists, while localism is incompatible with communism. The promotion of local cadres must still follow the principle of being both moral and capable, and in some scopes, there should still be appropriate adjustments. For example, in the county level, it is not necessarily beneficial to have all local cadres, let alone above the county level.

Next, let's talk about the issue of the Youth League.

The Communist Youth League is a powerful assistant of the Party. All levels of Party organizations should closely care about the consolidation of the Youth League and the improvement of the quality of members. The work of the Youth League has achieved significant results in recent years. However, in this great debate and anti-rightist struggle, many problems have been exposed among the members, especially in the Youth League's cadre policy and ideological and political education work. It is necessary to combine this rectification movement to thoroughly rectify the organization and work of the Youth League.

For Youth League members who have committed various serious errors, in conducting organizational processing, it is basically possible to refer to the principles of processing Party members who have committed various errors, but it should be slightly more lenient and should focus more on education.

(VIII) Improving Work and Striving for Complete Victory

Improving work and anti-rightist struggles are equally important and should not neglect either aspect.

The consolidation and strengthening of the Party's leadership depends on the Party itself, on whether the leadership is correct, and on whether the shortcomings and errors in work can be genuinely corrected. Anti-rightist struggles themselves cannot eliminate our shortcomings and errors.

In the movement, many criticisms and suggestions have been raised within and outside the Party. Most of these criticisms and suggestions are correct, and even if some are somewhat extreme, they are not without benefit.

In our work, the most prominent problems are:

Many regulations and systems are unreasonable, impractical, and contradictory. This affects the relationships between superiors and subordinates, between peers, between this department and that department, between this group of people and that group of people, and affects the development of production. Some of these were originally incorrect, some were originally correct but have not been changed in time due to changing conditions; some should be regulated by local authorities according to local conditions, rather than by the central government; some were made by central departments acting independently and without coordination; some were unavoidable due to lack of experience, and some were completely avoidable. There are phenomena of over-centralization and decentralization. Some local regulations also have similar situations.

Many leading organs and cadres have serious phenomena of being detached from reality and the masses. Responsible comrades are busy with trivial matters and have little contact with the masses, knowing little about the problems of the masses. Many unreasonable living systems have fostered the tendency of cadres to be detached from the masses. Many cadres are arrogant, self-righteous, do not follow the mass line, and do not consult with the masses on matters. Many cadres do not want to associate with non-Party masses and non-Party personnel.

These phenomena must be changed and must be firmly corrected.

We are a country of 600 million people. Uniting 600 million people, with one heart and one mind, to build socialism is a great and arduous task. To achieve this task, it is necessary to adhere to the mass line, correctly handle contradictions among the people; it is necessary to create a political situation that is both centralized and democratic, both disciplined and free, both unified in will and with individual spirits comfortable and lively. Such a political situation can make the Party and the state more consolidated, more able to withstand risks, more able to overcome difficulties, and is conducive to the development of the socialist revolution and socialist construction, and is conducive to the faster realization of our country's industrialization and modernization of agriculture.

To create such a political situation, on the one hand, it is necessary to carry out the anti-rightist struggle, strengthen the dictatorship over counter-revolutionaries, consolidate the discipline of the Party and the state, and on the other hand, it is necessary to overcome sectarianism, bureaucratism, and subjectivism.

To rectify the work style and improve work, the following three points should be focused on at present:

(1) Overcome sectarianism and the tendency of special treatment. Communist Party members should be selfless and united with the masses, sharing joys and sorrows. Party members should have close ties with non-Party masses and non-Party personnel, and make many friends. The living standards of cadres should not be too different from the masses, abolish regulations and systems that create special treatment for cadres, and advocate a frugal and simple style. Leading cadres should approach the grassroots and the masses, and cadres should participate in physical labor. The living standards of workers and peasants and urban and rural residents should not be too different. The improvement of living standards must consider the situation of the majority of the people in the country, so at present, it is necessary to insist on a reasonable low-wage system and strive to ensure that everyone has enough to eat.

(2) Change some unreasonable regulations in systems and organizations, and appropriately adjust the relationship between centralization and decentralization, and between supervision and responsibility, between Party and government, and between superiors and subordinates. What should be centralized must be centralized, what should be decentralized must be decentralized, and what should be delegated must be delegated. The phenomena of over-centralization and decentralization must be corrected.

The Political Bureau of the Central Committee has submitted three documents to this plenary session regarding the industrial, commercial, and financial systems, mainly aiming to delegate some powers to local authorities to mobilize local initiatives, strengthen the leadership of various enterprises and undertakings, overcome subjectivism and bureaucratism, and at the same time, not damage unified leadership and key construction. This change is definitely better than the current system. However, the new regulations will not be perfect and will need to be supplemented and improved in the process of implementation. It is worth noting that after some powers are delegated, new contradictions will still emerge, so it is even more necessary to strengthen planning and balancing work. This point should be paid attention to by both the central and local authorities.

The number of personnel in Party and government organs and non-production personnel in enterprises and institutions is too large, and the organizational structure is bloated, which has also fostered the development of subjectivism and bureaucratism. It is necessary to vigorously streamline the organization. Streamlining the organization, reducing full-time personnel, has three major significances for the current national construction: First, overcoming the bureaucratism and subjectivism of being detached from reality and the masses. Second, building a cadre force that is dedicated to the cause of communism, tempered, and able to withstand risks. Third, saving a large amount of manpower and financial resources, strengthening the labor front, strengthening the grassroots, and accelerating construction. Therefore, each unit should quickly formulate a reorganization plan, mobilize a large number of personnel to go to production, go to grassroots units that need strengthening, or make other arrangements. Many unnecessary and overlapping organizations should be merged and reduced in levels. To streamline the organization, in addition to young intellectual cadres who must participate in production labor or grassroots work, other cadres also need to return to production or grassroots work in batches. In our country, it is necessary to foster the good tradition of cadres being able to go up and down, able to leave production and return to production.

(3) In the people's internal affairs, expand democratic life and continue to improve democratic systems. Handling contradictions among the people must adhere to the method of gentle persuasion, adhering to the method of "unity-criticism-unity." Leaders at all levels must fully respect the democratic rights of the people, often listen to the voices and demands of the people, seriously consider various reasonable different opinions and opposing opinions, sincerely accept the criticism and supervision of the masses, and resolutely correct their own shortcomings and errors. "All controversies among the people should be resolved by democratic methods, resolved by methods of discussion, criticism, and persuasion and education, and not by coercive and coercive methods." Only by implementing this instruction of Comrade Mao Zedong can the enthusiasm of the masses be inspired, the awareness of the masses be raised, and the masses be encouraged to speak out and express their opinions bravely, argue and insist on the truth in future political life.

The anti-rightist struggle is to clear the way for correctly handling contradictions among the people, and we must not allow anyone to use the anti-rightist struggle to block the channels of speech among the people, using coercive and coercive methods to resolve controversies among the people. To educate the broad masses, especially to dispel the concerns of the intermediate forces, the anti-rightist struggle itself must also pay special attention to adhering to the principle of presenting facts, reasoning, and persuading with reason, preventing roughness and violence, and avoiding exaggeration and one-sidedness; for the erroneous views of intermediate forces and workers and peasants, the method of patient persuasion and education should be adopted; for academic controversies, it is especially necessary to oppose rashness and arbitrariness. It is necessary to make the results of the anti-rightist struggle conducive to, rather than detrimental to, the implementation of the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend," and conducive to, rather than detrimental to, fostering the atmosphere of the people daring to speak out.

We must strive for a complete victory in the movement. The so-called complete victory is to achieve victory in the anti-rightist struggle, achieve victory in improving work, achieve victory in transforming ideology, and make the results of the struggle create the political situation mentioned above.

At present, the anti-rightist struggle still needs to be deepened and expanded, and in this regard, we have already achieved decisive victories, while improving work has just begun. This is something that must be especially paid attention to.

For improving work, some regions and units have done a relatively good job. The experience of these units has proven that most of the opinions raised by the masses can be immediately accepted and implemented by the unit itself, and only a small part of the problems need to be solved by higher authorities or the central government.

To seriously improve work, it is necessary to continue to mobilize the masses to speak out freely, allowing the opinions of the masses to be fully expressed without reservation. Various departments and units of the central and local governments should establish special groups led by responsible comrades to widely collect the opinions of the masses on improving work, and after careful study, propose plans and schemes for improving work, and gradually implement them. The situation of improving work in various departments and units must be reported to higher authorities and the central government in a timely manner.

At present, the rectification movement in many units across the country has entered the high tide of improving work, and these units have shown a new and vibrant work situation. Past shortcomings that have been dragged on for many years have been quickly overcome this time, and problems that used to take a long time to solve have been solved in a short time. The enthusiasm of the masses has been greatly enhanced, and the ties between the Party and the masses, and between cadres and the masses, have been greatly strengthened. However, there are still many units where the leading comrades do not pay enough attention to improving work. Some people are afraid to expose shortcomings, and as soon as the movement begins, they do not dare to let the masses speak out; some people, after the debate, use the anti-rightist struggle to cover up their own mistakes, trying to evade rectification and pass through; a few people even retaliate against those who raise opinions. These are not allowed. In the process of improving work, our slogan for the masses should be: resolutely let them speak, boldly let them speak, thoroughly let them speak; while for leading comrades, the slogan should be: resolutely change, boldly change, thoroughly change. All levels of Party committees must seriously strengthen the leadership of the third and fourth stages of the rectification, striving for a complete victory in the movement.

　　关于整风运动的报告
　　一九五七年九月二十三日在中国共产党第八届中央委员会第三次扩大的全体会议上
　　邓小平
    （一）运动的一般情况
    从今年五月开始的整风运动和反右派斗争，八月以前主要在省市以上党政机关、大专学校、民主党派、新闻出版界、科学技术界、文艺界、卫生界中进行。八月以后逐步向工人、农民、工商界、中小学教职员展开。军队也同时开展了整风。现在正扩大成为全民的整风运动。
    毛泽东同志七月在青岛召开的一部分省市委书记会议上，对于整风运动和反右派斗争的性质和情况，作出了全面的估计，对于运动的发展，提出了明确的方针。现在全国的运动正按照中央的方针顺利地开展着。
    这一次批判资产阶级右派的意义，不要估计小了。这是一个在政治战线上和思想战线上的社会主义革命。单有一九五六年在经济战线上（在生产资料所有制上）的社会主义革命，是不够的，并且是不巩固的。目前的全民性的大辩论，解决了和正在解决着革命和建设工作是否正确（革命和建设的成绩是不是主要的），是否应走社会主义道路，要不要共产党领导，要不要无产阶级专政，要不要民主集中制，以及我国的外交政策是否正确等项重大问题。我们如果不能在这次辩论中取得完全胜利，我们就不能继续前进。只要我们在辩论中胜利了，就将大大促进我国的社会主义改造和社会主义建设。
    这个运动要解决敌我之间和人民内部的两种不同性质的矛盾。在我国社会主义革命时期，资产阶级反动右派和人民的矛盾是敌我矛盾，是对抗性的不可调和的你死我活的矛盾。城乡各种反革命分子，农村中还在进行破坏活动的地主富农分子，社会上的流氓、阿飞、盗窃犯、凶杀犯、强奸犯、贪污犯、严重破坏社会秩序和严重违法乱纪的罪犯以及公众公认为坏人的人，他们同人民的矛盾也是敌我矛盾。除此以外，都是人民内部的矛盾。
    人民内部的整风，也包含着性质不同的两个社会范畴的问题。资产阶级和资产阶级知识分子是使他们接受社会主义改造的问题；小资产阶级（农民和城乡独立劳动者），特别是富裕中农，也是使他们接受社会主义改造的问题。工人阶级和共产党的基本队伍，则是整顿作风的问题。
    整风运动的目的是把斗争方向引导到端正政治方向，提高思想水平，改正工作缺点，团结广大群众，孤立和分化资产阶级右派和一切反社会主义的分子。
    对于敌人，要进行坚决的斗争，要用揭露、孤立和分化的方法，有的还要用惩办和镇压的方法。对于人民内部，主要是用教育的方法，“团结——批评——团结”的方法。人民中的犯法分子也要给予法律处分，这种处分也有教育作用。
    四个多月来运动的发展，完全符合中央和毛泽东同志的分析，完全证明了中央方针的正确性。
    运动证明了：对资产阶级右派分子和城乡各种反社会主义分子进行坚决斗争的必要性。他们对于社会主义道路和共产党领导的进攻，是极为猖獗、极为狠毒的，他们是有纲领、有组织、有计划的，他们的目的是要使资本主义和反动统治复辟。
    运动证明了：在资产阶级和资产阶级知识分子中，在小资产阶级、特别是在富裕中农中，继续进行社会主义改造的必要性。他们中间有不少的人还在向往资本主义，不高兴社会主义，无产阶级和共产党对他们的领导权还不巩固。他们是右派分子活动的市场。但是他们的绝大多数经过批评和教育，是可以接受社会主义的。我们必须用大力团结和教育中间派，这样才能孤立右派，壮大左派。
    运动证明了：在工人阶级中，在农村的贫农下中农中，进行一次大规模的社会主义教育运动，也是非常必要的。他们是维护社会主义的最坚决的力量。在他们中间进行社会主义教育，可以使他们得到更好的武器去进行斗争。此外，他们中间也有一小部分人还带有小资产阶级的思想，还可能接受资产阶级的影响。但是只要认真地摆事实，讲道理，他们是很容易明白的。
    运动证明了：在共产党的基本队伍中，在各级党、政府、人民团体、企业单位的领导机关和领导干部中，进行一次大规模的整风运动，是十分必要的。党在基本上是健康的，绝大多数党员干部是好的。但是从群众的大鸣大放中，也揭露了我们在工作上和作风上的大量缺点，有些是很严重的，不改正是危险的。同时，在党员和团员中也有少数的右派分子，另有一部分人则有严重的右倾思想。
    运动证明了：在斗争中必须坚定地信任群众的多数，充分运用群众路线。实行大鸣大放大争，摆事实，讲道理，出大字报，开座谈会和辩论会，这是最广泛的社会主义民主，是资产阶级民主所不能梦想的。这是正确处理人民内部矛盾的方法，也是教育和团结群众对敌人进行斗争的方法。大鸣大放，放一把火烧敌人，也烧自己的缺点，这两者都是我们所要求的。事实证明：不敢实行大鸣大放，怕出乱子，不相信多数群众的觉悟程度，不相信群众的智慧和力量，这种右倾观点是非常有害的，并且已经为事实所驳倒了。
    运动的发展是健康的，已经得到显著的成效。特别是那些鸣放得充分的单位，和那些注意改正工作缺点的单位，成效更显著。整个运动发展的情况是：右派被孤立被分化，中间派向左靠，左派力量在增加。
    但是运动还要继续深入和展开，不能草率收兵，不能前紧后松，必须争取全胜。在中央、省（市）、地、县四级机关，运动都必须经过四个阶段，即大鸣大放阶段（同时进行整改），反击右派阶段（同时进行整改），着重整改阶段（同时继续鸣放），每人研究文件、批评反省、提高自己阶段。凡是在反右派斗争已经取得决定性胜利的单位，应该及时转入以整改为主的第三阶段，同时对资产阶级思想进行有系统的批判。当然，有些单位的情况同机关不同，运动发展的阶段也就不完全相同。例如农村，有大鸣大放，有对于坏分子的斗争和对于富裕中农的批判，但是这并不同于机关中的反右派。对于农民和工人，要进行社会主义教育，但是只有一小部分人需要进行批评和自我批评，也不可能像机关干部那样每人研究文件、批评反省。工人、农民、学生在着重整改阶段都要继续鸣放，督促和帮助领导干部整改，但是并非他们自己也着重整改，那是对领导干部说的。此外，在第三、第四阶段如果继续发现右派，或者原有的右派还没有低头，当然仍有反右派的任务。所以对这四个阶段不能看得太死。总之，对于领导干部来说，这四个阶段都必须经过，并且都必须搞透。运动的全胜，不只决定于反右派阶段，尤其决定于着重整改的第三阶段和每人研究文件、批评反省、提高自己的第四阶段。
    （二）关于资产阶级和知识分子
    这次反右派斗争，主要是在资产阶级和知识分子的范围内进行。这里面包括工商业者、民主党派、教育界、新闻出版界、文艺界、科学技术界、卫生界、国家机关的许多工作人员、大学生等。知识分子并不是一个阶级，他们是分属于不同的阶级的，但是就我国目前的情况来说，多数的知识分子是资产阶级和小资产阶级家庭出身的，所受的教育也是资产阶级式的。所以，为方便起见，同资产阶级放在一起说。
    消灭资产阶级的问题是社会主义革命的一个根本问题。资产阶级，特别是它的知识分子，是现在可以同无产阶级较量的主要力量。他们还有政治地位、政治资本和政治影响，而无产阶级也需要他们的知识。但是如果他们不坚决进行社会主义改造，他们同无产阶级的冲突是不可避免的。资产阶级知识分子的唯一出路就是改造自己，为社会主义的经济基础服务，否则就有变成上不沾天下不着地的“梁上君子”的危险。
    党对资产阶级分子和知识分子的政策是一贯的。党对资产阶级工商业者实行赎买政策，并且争取他们继续为社会主义服务。党对各民主党派实行长期共存、互相监督的方针。党在学术文化范围内主张百家争鸣、百花齐放。所有这些方针政策都以社会主义为前提。党始终坚持：资产阶级分子和资产阶级知识分子必须彻底改造，必须逐步工人阶级化。党的领导、无产阶级专政、民主集中制绝对不容动摇。党的各项基本政策，例如肃清反革命分子的政策、合作化政策、主要农产品的统购统销政策等，绝对不容动摇。马列主义的宣传和政治教育必须加强，错误思想必须批判，“毒草”必须锄掉。对于“毒草”的开放，是为了从反面教育群众，为了锄掉可以作肥料，为了在斗争中锻炼无产阶级和广大群众。党并且指出，把无产阶级和资产阶级的矛盾作为人民内部矛盾来处理，条件之一是资产阶级接受我们的方针，接受社会主义改造和党的领导，否则就会转化为敌我矛盾。
    资产阶级对一九五六年的社会主义改造基本上没有反抗，这是因为：（1）他们在经济上已经没有别的出路；（2）经过“三反”“五反”，他们中的多数人认识了反对无产阶级是没有出路的；（3）政府对他们合营后，在经济上和政治上都作了适当的安置。但是所有制的改变并不等于社会主义革命的完成，更不等于阶级斗争的熄灭。资产阶级同无产阶级在政治上思想上的斗争并没有结束，而且在一定条件下可以重新尖锐化。最近时期右派向共产党向社会主义的猖狂进攻就说明了这一点。
    资产阶级和资产阶级知识分子在社会主义革命中分成了左中右三派。左派站在拥护社会主义、拥护党的领导的立场。右派坚决反对社会主义，反对党的领导。左右两派在资产阶级和资产阶级知识分子中都是少数，多数是中间派。右派要同左派争夺中间派。右派总想向共产党和社会主义进攻，但是要等待时机。右派认为匈牙利事件、提出百家争鸣和长期共存政策、宣传正确处理人民内部矛盾、党的整风就是他们的“时机”。
    右派分子一般是剥削阶级出身的。从历史上看，有许多人参加过反动党团，在民主革命时期就是右派。但是历史是发展的，人是变化着的。民主革命时期的右派也有许多人现在有了转变。相反，一部分在民主革命时期的中间派甚至左派现在却成了右派。这说明在社会主义革命中不可避免地要发生新的政治分化。
    右派分子活动的主要场所是知识分子成堆的地方，如高等学校、某些国家机关、新闻出版机关、文艺团体、政法界、科学技术界、医药界等。知识分子过去经过几次运动，多数人都有了不同程度的进步，有一小部分人已经成为左派。多数人现在可以接受或者并不反对社会主义，但是他们中间的许多人浸透了资产阶级世界观，真正变为工人阶级的知识分子还需要一段相当长的时间。由于工人阶级的知识分子队伍还比较薄弱，由于中间派在某种条件下还可以跟随右派，所以右派知识分子在这次进攻中特别猖狂。
    各民主党派中的右派分子在右派进攻中起了骨干作用，因为人民给了他们一定的政治地位，他们可以利用合法地位发号施令，招兵买马。民主党派是民主革命时期的产物，其中有些成员在社会主义革命时期成为左派，但是大多数成员还没有从资产阶级立场转到无产阶级立场。因此，右派一度在民主党派的许多组织中占了上风。
    资产阶级右派在向党进攻的时候所提出的形形色色的反动纲领，其实质就是反对社会主义，反对党的领导。他们在政治上的主要论点是：（1）宣扬资产阶级的经济政治制度和资产阶级文化，反对社会主义的经济政治制度和社会主义文化。（2）反对国家的基本政策，如外交政策、统购统销政策、知识分子政策、五大运动等。（3）否认人民民主革命、社会主义革命、社会主义建设的成绩，否认党和无产阶级能够领导国家建设。（4）反对党对国家工作的领导，反对党在各个部门（特别是文教科学技术部门）的领导，要求取消党在若干基层单位（特别是高等学校和新闻出版机关）的领导。
    右派在学术文化方面的主要论点是：外行不能领导内行。马克思主义就是教条主义。社会主义国家没有科学文化，有也不如资本主义国家。要求资产阶级的社会学、经济学、历史学、唯心论哲学复辟。向党和人民政府要求“独立”和“自由”：“新闻自由”、“出版自由”、“文艺自由”等。
    右派的进攻说明，资产阶级和资产阶级知识分子中的多数对于无产阶级和共产党的领导还不心服。共产党在民主党派、知识界和工商界的一部分人（右派）中，当然不可能有领导权，因为他们是敌人。在多数人（中间派）中的领导权也不巩固，有些文教单位还根本没有建立党的领导。右派分子决心要同我们较量一下。较量了，他们失败了，他们才懂得他们的大势已去，没有希望了。只有在这个时候，资产阶级和资产阶级知识分子中的多数人（中间派和一部分右派）才会逐渐老实起来，把自己的资产阶级立场逐渐抛弃，站到无产阶级方面来，下决心接受无产阶级的领导。
    经过三个多月的斗争，情况已经发生了极大的变化。在各民主党派、高等学校、其他知识界和省市以上机关，斗争一般已经取得了决定性的胜利。
    当前的任务是把反右派斗争进行到底。为此，要继续反对右倾情绪，但是也要防止打击面过宽和简单粗暴的危险。要注意严格掌握划分极右分子、右派分子和中右分子的界限，始终注意审定所属单位的右派分子的名单，对划分不当的必须随时纠正。要十分注意团结中间派的工作，并且注意促进右派分子的分化，帮助其中已有悔改表现的人逐步改造。应该看到，有些右派分子是可以改造的，改造以后对人民还是有用的。
    在反右派斗争已告一段落的单位，应该坚决及时地转入整改和思想教育阶段。现在有不少单位对于转入整改缺乏决心，应该纠正。所谓反右派斗争告一段落，是说已使所有右派分子受到揭露、批判和孤立，并且使大多数右派分子在群众面前低头认罪，不是说所有右派分子的检讨和交代都达到彻底的程度。总有一部分右派分子是不会悔改的，他们要把反动观点带到棺材里去，多数右派分子也不会在短期内真正转变。但是只要他们在群众中孤立了，就是我们的斗争胜利了。
    资产阶级知识分子，除了其中少数人具有右派观点外，还有其他严重的错误观点，特别是个人主义、自由主义、无政府主义、平均主义和民族主义等。在思想教育和批评反省阶段，必须集中力量对这些错误观点给以系统的批判。这是这次整风运动所必须完成的最重大任务之一。
    知识分子的思想改造是一个长期性的任务，可能还需要十年以上的时间。但是应该在这次运动中，对一般资产阶级知识分子和工商界进行广泛的社会主义教育，摧毁资产阶级思想的阵地，根本改变许多文教单位和民主党派的政治面貌，建立对中间派的巩固的领导权，并且尽可能早日巩固起来。
    必须大力加强文教战线的领导骨干，切实整顿许多文教组织。为了建成社会主义，工人阶级必须有自己的技术干部的队伍，必须有自己的教授、教员、科学家、新闻记者、文学家、艺术家和马克思主义理论家的队伍。这是一个宏大的队伍，人少了是不成的。全党必须注意培养革命的专门家。全党的干部，凡是有条件的，都必须认真地钻研理论和业务，顽强地下苦功，把自己造成为“又红又专”的红色专家。为了达到这个目的，中央和地方都要在最近时期定出分门别类的具体计划，大力贯彻执行。
      为了培养工人阶级的知识分子队伍，还必须用革命的精神培养新的知识分子，革新和加强学校中的思想政治教育和劳动教育，加强从工人农民中培养知识分子的工作，并且有计划地吸收优秀的革命知识分子入党。
    现有的几百万知识分子虽然现在多数是中间派，但是他们的大多数是愿意进步的。工人阶级培养自己的知识分子的计划，必须把他们包括在内。必须看到，他们是国家的重要财富，社会主义的经济文化建设，新生力量的培养，都需要他们努力。因此要用大力团结、争取和教育他们，纠正他们的错误观点，帮助他们实行自我改造，用妥善的而不是粗暴的方法使他们逐步脱离中间状态，站到工人阶级方面来。要通过整风和马克思列宁主义的学习，帮助他们深入群众，接近实际，并且同他们多谈话，多交朋友，倾听他们对工作的建议，帮助他们解决工作中的困难。过去我们在这些方面的缺点必须克服。知识分子在鸣放期间所提的意见绝大部分是正确的，应该认真研究处理。在学术文化工作中的百家争鸣、百花齐放的方针，必须采取一系列具体措施加以贯彻。当然，这是一个社会主义的方针，实行这个方针必须按照毛泽东同志所提出的六条标准，为了繁荣社会主义的而不是资本主义的学术文化。
    对于右派分子的处理，原则上应该是严肃和宽大相结合。政治上思想上要斗透，处理上则不宜过分，以便对右派分子继续分化和改造。但是也不能宽大无边，混淆了敌我界限和是非界限。在这个问题上，必须注意掌握分寸。
    在社会主义革命时期，需要一个新的、为社会主义服务的统一战线。应该在六条标准的基础上，贯彻执行长期共存、互相监督的方针。认为各民主党派再无作用的意见是错误的。各民主党派中央最近都开过全国整风工作会议，应该帮助他们在继续深入中央和省市的斗争的同时，把斗争积极地有步骤地深入到一切基层组织中去，然后转入一般整风，破资本主义立场，立社会主义立场。
    工商界骨干分子整风的办法大体上和各民主党派相同。一般的资产阶级分子，根据不同情况，或者参加工商界骨干的整风，或者另外编组整风。对于资本家中的右派分子抵抗社会主义改造的活动，和他们对于工人群众思想的侵蚀，要加以揭发和批判。对于他们中间的严重违法活动应该进行斗争，以便教育多数，巩固社会主义阵地。“地下工厂”要禁止，要变成地上的，以便加以管理、监督和改造。小型工商业者则着重进行社会主义教育，可能的时候也可以组织辩论，略如工人、农民中的整风办法。他们中间有严重违法活动的，也要进行揭发和斗争。总之，一定要使工商界所有的人受到教育，不要像过去的某些运动那样把一部分人（主要是小型工商业者）忘记了。
    （三）关于农村
    农村总的情况是好的：合作社基本上是巩固的，粮食增产了，干部作风也有了进步。但是由于办社的时间短、经验少、灾荒大，所以还有困难和缺点。
    合作化实现，生产资料所有制问题基本上解决了，但是这不等于说农村中没有问题了。
    一部分农民对国家、合作社、家庭三者的关系还有认识不清的地方，存在着不顾国家利益和集体利益的个人主义和本位主义思想。在统购统销问题上，富裕农民同国家的矛盾比较突出，他们中间有不少人用各种办法少卖余粮和其他主要农产品，某些人甚至进行投机活动。特别在自由市场开放以后，一部分农民中的资本主义自发倾向重新抬头。
    富裕中农的绝大部分因为大势所趋加入了合作社，但是他们中间的大部分人思想上还是动摇的。少数坚持资本主义道路的分子，或者在被迫入社以后，带头捣乱闹退社；或者在社外进行破坏合作社的活动。他们总想同合作社较量一下。此外，他们也是农村中抵抗统购统销政策、从事粮食投机的主要势力。
    反革命分子、坏分子和一部分地主、富农分子，也乘机进行破坏活动：制造反动言论，散布谣言，闹迷信，搞赌博，搞倒算，煽动闹事，甚至建立反革命组织，制造暴乱。
    党内在最近一个时期存在着严重的右倾思想：认为农村中两条道路的斗争已经结束，可以不再强调阶级路线；可以埋头搞生产，放松对于农民的社会主义教育。对反动分子的破坏活动麻痹大意，没有及时地给以有力的打击。在农村干部中，也有少数人由于家庭经济地位变化，资本主义思想有了发展。这些人在合作化、统购统销等基本问题上，实际上站在富裕中农的立场，对党和国家的政策表示怀疑和不满。
    由此可见，和城市一样，在农村中，仍然有或者是社会主义或者是资本主义这样两条道路的斗争。这个斗争，需要很长时间，才能取得彻底胜利。这是整个过渡时期的任务。
    正在全国农村开展的社会主义教育运动，它的目的是：（1）在大辩论中明辨是非，坚定走社会主义道路的信心和决心；（2）批判富裕中农的资本主义思想和个人主义思想，克服农村中的资本主义影响；（3）揭露和打击地主、富农、反革命分子和其他坏分子的破坏活动；（4）在群众性的批评和自我批评的基础上，整社、整党、整团，改进干部作风，克服工作缺点，以达到改善党群关系和干群关系、纯洁党的队伍、巩固合作社、巩固统购统销政策、发展农业生产的目的。
    开展农村社会主义教育运动的方法，同样必须是大鸣大放大争，同样必须是坚定地信任群众的多数。
    现在全国采取了几种不同办法，但都是大同小异的。各地情况不一，不必强求一律。但是，不管采取那种办法，都不应该妨碍大鸣大放。已有的经验证明，惟有大鸣大放，才能大争，惟有大争，才能暴露反社会主义分子的言行，才能明辨是非，提高觉悟。尤其重要的是，惟有大鸣大放，才能使群众畅所欲言，对于干部的缺点或错误提出批评，揭露工作中的缺点，使干部头脑清醒起来，以利于改进工作，提高干部的思想水平和业务能力。同时在运动中，要坚持“只动口、不动手”的原则，防止和纠正简单粗暴的作法。
    在农民和其他劳动人民中，一概不提反右派斗争的口号，不戴资产阶级右派分子的“帽子”。
    各地材料证明，在县区乡干部中有一小部分阶级异己分子、严重的违法乱纪分子，和具有严重资本主义倾向的分子。为了加强农村运动的领导，为了同上述这些分子作斗争，为了批判各种右倾思想，必须开好各县的三级干部会议。三级干部会议也必须采取大鸣大放大争的办法。
    对于农村中的反革命分子和坏分子，必须给以坚决的打击，才能发扬正气，压倒邪气。被判刑的反革命分子和坏分子，在刑满释放以后如果又犯罪，必须再捉再判。对各种破坏公共秩序、严重违法乱纪的罪犯以及公众公认为坏人的人，必须坚决惩办，并且必须坚决取缔会道门，禁止赌博。现在政法部门有些工作人员，对于本来应该逮捕判处的人，也放弃职守，不予逮捕判处，这是不对的。轻罪重判不对，重罪轻判也不对，目前时期的危险是在后者。这种偏向必须在各级党委的领导下，加以纠正。
    上述原则也同样适用于城市。
    各地农村中都有一些“大法不犯、小法常犯”的不良分子。对于这些人，如果由地方法院处理就不胜其烦，但是不加处理，对于生产秩序和社会秩序又有很大妨害。可以考虑由社员代表大会或者乡人民代表大会定出切实可行的公约，由上一级政府批准，加以约束，并建立调处委员会负责公约的执行。违反这些公约的，可以授权合作社或者乡政府给以适当处罚。这是一种群众性的自我教育、自我监督、自我约束的办法，是社会主义社会限制个人主义、改变旧的风俗习惯、形成新的风俗习惯的重要方法。不但在农村中，而且在城市中，在厂矿机关学校中，都可以试行。城市中有些破坏社会秩序的流氓分子，还可以遣送到本省农村中，由政府分别委托有条件的合作社管制生产。关于这一方面的问题，建议国务院研究适当办法，提请全国人民代表大会常委会审议决定。
    对于已经摘掉地主富农“帽子”而又从事破坏活动的地主富农分子，应该把“帽子”重新戴上。
    对于一部分具有严重资本主义思想和行为的富裕中农，必须进行说理斗争，但是不要与地主、富农、反革命分子、坏分子同等对待。对富裕中农仍是坚持团结、教育、改造的问题。
    对于单干户，不能歧视，不能苛待，要争取教育他们自愿地陆续加入合作社。但是不能给予单干户优于合作社的条件。他们要同社员一样承担对国家的各项义务。
    对于富裕中农和单干户，除进行政治教育外，还要采取一些经济措施以限制其资本主义自发倾向。有退社要求的富裕中农，要在经过大辩论和对某些收入降低的农户在经济上加以妥善安排（要有适当的让步）之后，达到大部留社、少数出社的目的。对少数坚决闹退社的，可以在批判他们的错误言行和剥夺他们的政治影响之后，开除他们出社。为了限制合作社社员向资本主义方向发展，对于自留地、个人开荒、个人经营副业和农村自由市场活动的范围，要有适当限制。对于单干户，要由乡政府或由乡政府委托合作社切实管起来，不让他们有进行资本主义活动和破坏合作社的“自由”。对他们的违法行为和有害活动（如挖合作社“墙脚”、雇工剥削、买青苗、放高利贷、做投机买卖、偷税漏税、出租土地等），必须加以限制或制止。城市的企业和机关要在农村招收工人和临时工的时候，应该经过合作社介绍，或者同合作社订合同，不许自由录用合作社员和单干农民。这点将由国务院作出规定。
    关于如何结合两条道路的辩论，整顿农业生产合作社，做好合作社生产管理工作，贯彻执行互利政策的问题，中央已发出三个专门指示，这里不再多说。这里只着重说明，农村阶级路线仍有决定意义，忘记了农村阶级分析和阶级路线是错误的。在整社中必须保证贫农和下中农的优势，合作社的主要干部必须一般地由贫农和下中农担任。
    合作社干部必须坚决参加生产劳动。现在许多社的干部这样作了，影响很好，但是还有不少干部对于这一点执行得不积极、不充分，有的甚至拒绝执行，需要继续加以督促，切实执行，并须经常坚持下去。
    合作社制度的巩固基本上决定于农业生产的发展。只有发展生产，增加农民收入，合作化表现出了很大优越性，才是社会主义在两条道路斗争中获得胜利的可靠保障。只有合作社的单位面积产量赶上或者超过当地富裕中农的水平，才能停止富裕中农的动摇，使他们跟着走社会主义道路。
    中国是一个六亿多人口的大国，农村人口又占总人口的百分之八十以上，如果不发展农业，不但影响最大多数人的生活，影响工农联盟和人民的团结，而且也不能迅速地发展工业。
    一九五六年一月制定的发展农业生产的四十条纲要草案，鼓舞了士气，起了很好的作用。现在中央根据一年多的经验，对四十条草案作了一些修正。提议全会基本通过这个纲要，以便在全国进行广泛的宣传和讨论。在农村两条道路的大辩论之后，应该以四十条纲要为中心，进行一次农业生产建设问题的大辩论，借以推动今年冬季的农业生产和建设的高潮，推动合作社在社员积极参加之下，制定本社发展农业的长期规划。在全国讨论之后，中央将对这一纲要作再一次的修改，经过年底党代表大会的讨论，然后提交国务院讨论通过，最后提交全国人民代表大会讨论通过，作为今后十年内制定农业计划和发展农业生产的指针。
    要实现四十条纲要，没有一股劲，不经常同保守倾向作斗争，是不行的。一九五六年生产高潮的巨大成绩应该肯定，这些成绩超过解放后的任何一年，有的项目甚至超过几年成绩的总和。当然也有缺点，应该好好总结经验，但是决不应该因为有些缺点，而对伟大成绩估计不足。一九五七年的农业生产，好的一面是工作踏实一些，但是有些地方有劲头不足的现象，必须注意纠正。
    农业在我国社会主义建设中的地位十分重要。我们的奋斗目标是把我国建成为一个现代化的工业国和现代化的农业国。在优先发展重工业的同时，必须大力发展农业。过去几年对工业宣传得多一些，调了一大批干部去搞工业，这是必要的，起了积极作用。但是对农业宣传就有些不够。现在应该着重宣传关于发展农业的重要意义，把社会上近两年来所出现的看不起农业生产、农民想进城、城里人不愿意下乡、平地人不愿意上山的不良风气改变过来。
    能否实现四十条，关键在于第二个五年计划。因此，全党必须加强领导农业。必须在今后国家建设中，增加农业（包括水利）基本建设投资，尽力发展化学肥料工业和其他能够促进农业生产发展的工业。
    在五年之内，全国绝大多数合作社必须赶上或者超过当地富裕中农的生产水平，使合作社集体经济的收入，加上社员家庭副业收入，总计起来，按人平均，赶上或者超过当地富裕中农的水平。现在农村中，百分之八十左右的农户已经达到合作化以前的一般中农水平，其中有百分之二十到三十已经达到富裕中农的水平，生活仍然贫困的农户一般不过占百分之十五左右。因此，在五年之内，达到这样的水平是完全可能的。
    在社员收入有所增加的条件下，应该尽可能地增加合作社的公共积累。依靠合作社自己的力量逐步增多一些基本建设，不仅是发展生产增加收入的可靠道路，而且是巩固社会主义制度（合作社）的物质基础。有了较多的公共财产，才会使合作社像钢骨水泥般地巩固起来，否则会像沙堆一样容易散掉。
    农民的收入增加了，生活改善了，要提倡节约，勤俭持家。节省出来的钱，向农业社投资，或者存入银行、信用社。粮食也要节约。除了完成和超额完成国家的统购任务以外，农业社和农户还应该储粮备荒。
    今冬明春，应该像前冬去春一样，掀起一个积肥和兴修农田水利的大运动，并适当地进行其他基本建设。对于这项工作，中央和国务院已经发了专门指示。各地可以根据不同情况，分别提出当地的具体指标和具体规划。
    合作社的一切增产措施必须充分运用群众路线，贯彻执行民主办社的原则。要善于用说服的方法，鼓舞群众的积极性，来举办有利于发展生产的各种事业，和解决合作社的各种问题。必须估计到，我们提倡的事情，即使完全正确，大量成功，如果不经过群众认真的讨论并作出决定，群众也会有不满；而事实上总会有一部分失败或者效果不好，如果没有经过群众就更难免群众的埋怨。但是只要一切通过群众，即使受了损失，也是大家负责，大家得到教训，利于团结和改正。这点必须教育基层干部经常加以注意。
    （四）关于工人阶级
    工人阶级队伍的整风问题，是本阶级整顿思想作风、提高阶级觉悟的问题，同资产阶级、资产阶级知识分子、小资产阶级接受社会主义改造的问题，有原则的区别。因此，应该着重改进工作和对群众进行社会主义教育，而不应该把机关学校中对待资产阶级知识分子的办法，拿来对待一般的工人群众。
    目前工人阶级队伍的组织状况和思想状况，总的方面是好的。一千一百几十万产业职工中，百分之八十五左右出身于工农和其他劳动人民的家庭，解放前的老工人占百分之三十五左右，共产党员占百分之十三（加上共青团员共占百分之二十九）。
    但是对于工人阶级的情况应该有具体的分析。历次运动证明，老工人都是党和社会主义事业的基本依靠。占工人总数百分之六十五左右的新工人中，农民、学生、城市贫民出身的占一半以上，他们的小资产阶级的思想作风比较浓厚。还有百分之三左右（有些单位超过百分之五）的新工人是原来的地主、富农、资本家、伪军警和游民分子，他们的剥削阶级意识和坏习气尚未得到应有的改造。
    因此，有必要在整风中对工人群众进行一次普遍深入的社会主义教育运动。有必要通过整风更好地树立和培养工人队伍的骨干和核心力量。有必要进一步清查坏人，纯洁工人阶级队伍。经过整风和社会主义教育运动，把工人阶级锻炼成为一支有觉悟、有组织、有纪律的战斗队伍。
    教育的中心内容，是关于工人阶级在社会主义革命和建设事业中的领导地位和领导责任问题，是在无产阶级专政下工人群众的政治任务问题。要使工人群众懂得：必须在共产党领导下，不断提高自己的觉悟，加强组织性和纪律性，增强阶级内部的团结；必须发扬艰苦奋斗的优良传统，保持大公无私的高贵品质，努力生产，克勤克俭，以自己的模范作用，带动全国人民，为完成社会主义建设而斗争。
    在一部分以新工人为主的工厂中，要着重解决新工人的改造立场的问题。在一切新工人中明白提出思想改造的任务，是完全必要的。
    应该结合工人的切身生活体验和他们提出的主要问题，结合国家政治经济生活和本企业的具体状况，提出讨论题目。一般可以讨论：（1）工人阶级如何负起领导阶级责任的问题；（2）个人和集体、个人和国家的关系问题；（3）生活改善和生产发展的关系问题；（4）自由和纪律、民主和集中的关系问题；（5）工农关系问题（主要是讨论工人生活水平不要过高于农民）。通过对这些问题的讨论，作好关于改进工资福利制度的思想准备。
    在职工中实行大鸣大放，要充分运用大字报。大字报形式简便，生动活泼，引人注意，便于发动群众；批评领导人员和工人群众中的缺点，提出各种合理化建议，明确尖锐，有声有色。无论工厂或者机关学校，都可以把大字报逐步变成经常的发展批评和自我批评的一种重要形式。
    在工厂中整风和进行社会主义教育，改造新工人的思想，要着重依靠老工人和工龄较长、受政治教育较多的工人。必须充分发挥老工人的积极作用，用他们的丰富的生产和生活经验，他们的阶级觉悟，他们的组织性、纪律性，去团结和教育新工人，特别是青年工人。几年来不少干部对老工人的作用有些忽视，在某些政策措施上，如晋级、计件工资、工作安排、劳动保险、子女就业等，对老工人的照顾有些不够，需要加以改进。
    领导上必须认真整顿作风，改进工作，要自始至终贯彻执行边整边改的方针。
    要检查和克服官僚主义、主观主义和宗派主义。领导干部（包括党、政、工、团）参加体力劳动要成为一项经常制度。要利用一切可能的机会，钻研技术和业务，逐步地使自己从外行变成内行。要深入生产，深入工人，关怀群众疾苦。生活上和工人打成一片，坚决废除脱离群众的特殊待遇。帮助和引导工段一级干部克服命令主义，使他们作到既能勇于负责，又会走群众路线。
    要大力紧缩机构，减少党、政、工、团的工作人员和企业中过多的非生产人员。注意从工人中培养和生长干部，充分发挥不脱产、半脱产的积极分子和干部的作用。强调技术人员和职员同工人相结合，组织他们参加实际操作，以便培养出大批既有实际经验、又与群众有密切联系的优秀干部。
    对于一些影响生产、影响团结、阻碍工人积极性发挥的各种规章制度，应该坚决修改或者废除。同时要相应地建立必要的新的管理制度和政治教育工作制度，以便从制度上巩固整风的成果。
    党委领导下的职工代表大会，是扩大企业民主、吸引职工群众参加企业管理、克服官僚主义的良好形式，是正确处理人民内部矛盾的有效方法之一，在这次整风中应该充分运用，并在总结试点经验之后，全面推广。
    职工代表大会的职权，应该遵照中央的规定，即：（1）听取和讨论厂长的工作报告，审查和讨论企业的生产计划、财务计划、技术计划、劳动工资计划和实现这些计划的重要措施，定期地检查计划执行情况，并提出建议。（2）审查和讨论企业奖励基金、福利费、医药费、劳动保护拨款、工会经费以及其他有关职工生活福利的经费开支，在不违反上级机关的指示、命令的条件下，可以就上述范围作出决议，交企业行政部门或者其他有关方面执行。（3）在必要的时候，向上级管理机关建议撤换某些企业领导人员。（4）对上级管理机关的规定有不同意的时候，可以向上级管理机关提出建议。但是如果上级管理机关经过研究仍旧坚持原有决定的时候，就必须贯彻执行。
    企业中的技术人员和职员，多数还属于资产阶级知识分子的范畴。整风主要是使他们接受社会主义改造的问题，大体上可以仿照机关整风的做法。但是因为他们直接参加生产建设，比较接近工人，和机关学校的高级知识分子有所不同。因此，对他们要按照不同对象和具体情况，分别对待，不应该采取简单化的方法。
    对工人中的极少数反社会主义分子，和流氓、阿飞、严重违法乱纪的坏分子等，应该进行批判和适当斗争。情况特别严重或屡教不改的，应该在运动结束以后开除出厂，并作适当处理。但是对于：（1）一般思想落后、爱说怪话、劳动纪律松弛或因工作、生活问题对领导不满的人；（2）有地域观念、本位主义思想、宗派情绪的人；（3）一般闹事分子等，不要不加区别地都当成政治上的反社会主义分子和坏分子加以斗争和打击。要十分注意防止打击报复，防止形成宗派斗争。
    对老工人和转业军人中发生的问题，应该特别慎重处理。
    手工业、运输业合作社的整风，应该和整社相结合。要充分发扬工人和贫苦独立劳动者走社会主义道路的积极性，注意团结比较富裕的有技术的社员，揭露和批判原来的小业主和一部分富裕的独立劳动者的资本主义倾向，制止他们当中某些人的破坏活动，在胜利的大辩论和干部整风的基础上巩固合作社。
    职工家属和城市其他劳动人民，也应该在当地党委的统一领导下，普遍开展社会主义教育运动，尽可能地组织鸣放，进行辩论，明确大是大非。
    （五）关于少数民族
    在一切已经基本上实现了生产资料所有制的社会主义改造的少数民族地区和少数民族人口中，应该同样进行社会主义教育，并且适当地进行反右派斗争。
    在少数民族中的社会主义教育和反右派斗争，除了同汉族地区相同的内容以外，还应该着重反对民族主义倾向。在广大群众中，应该用新旧对比的方法，宣传各民族团结统一在中国共产党和中央人民政府领导下的民族大家庭的利益和必要，揭露坏分子破坏民族团结的活动。在少数民族干部和上层人士中，应该指出，地方民族主义倾向和大汉族主义倾向，同样是资产阶级的反社会主义的倾向，对于社会主义祖国的各民族的团结统一同样有危险。过去我们强调反对汉族干部中的大汉族主义倾向，这是完全必要的，今后也仍然要继续坚决反对大汉族主义。但是目前在少数民族干部中，强调反对地方民族主义倾向，是同样必要的。应该认清，一切利用狭隘的民族感情和历史遗留下来的民族间的某些隔阂、来分裂民族团结和破坏祖国统一的人，都是违反我国宪法和危害我国社会主义事业的，都是反社会主义的右派分子。对于公然煽动民族分离的特别恶劣的分子，应该坚决地加以揭露和驳斥，使其完全孤立，借以教育群众和干部。
    在少数民族中进行反民族主义的社会主义教育，关键在于少数民族地区的党组织。只有在各民族中形成了真正具有无产阶级觉悟的共产主义核心，才能克服本民族的资产阶级民族主义倾向，巩固民族间的团结统一。各民族的党员都必须了解：民族主义是资产阶级思想的一个重要方面，同无产阶级世界观根本不相容，它是一种反马克思列宁主义、反共产主义的思想，共产党内决不能允许这种资产阶级思想存在。因此，在各少数民族地区的共产党组织中，必须定出计划，进行反对资产阶级民族主义的教育，并且按照具体条件，对本民族某些党员中突出的民族主义倾向进行必要的批判。
    培养少数民族干部的学校中的政治教育方针应该改变，今后应该着重进行阶级教育和马克思列宁主义民族观点的教育，树立学生的共产主义的世界观和人生观。
    民族问题的完全解决是一个长期的过程，因此，对于民族主义倾向的批判必须防止急躁，必须慎重地由上而下地有领导地进行，必须注意获得本民族多数党员干部和非党积极分子的支持。汉族干部仍然应该继续注意检查和批判大汉族主义倾向，本地民族干部则应该着重检查和批判地方民族主义。只有经常注意反对资产阶级民族主义（包括大民族主义和地方民族主义）的思想，才能不断提高各民族党员和人民群众的觉悟，巩固和加强各民族的团结统一。
    在完成了民主改革而没有进行社会主义改造的少数民族地区，在社会上不要进行反右派斗争，但是可以在适当范围内，用适当方式，进行社会主义教育。
    （六）关于军队
    在军队方面，经过反右派斗争，军队系统也查出了少数右派分子。这对于军队的巩固是有重大意义的。但是军队一般比较纯洁，因此，在反右派斗争告一结束以后，应该集中力量进行内部整风，并以干部为重点。
      在近几年的社会大变革中，军队干部的政治思想状况基本上是健康的。但是由于处于和平环境，大批新成分参加军队，以及某些工作人员不适当地强调专业化、忽视思想政治工作等原因，几年来，干部的个人主义和无组织无纪律倾向有了一些发展。有的干部以为革命大功告成，自己有功劳，应该“论功行赏”。他们不是兢兢业业地去完成任务，而是追求名誉、地位和待遇，计较个人得失，不愿到艰苦地区去工作。军队在官兵关系、上下级关系和军民关系等方面，也有一些缺点需要克服。军队同地方党政联系不够，有关社会主义改造和社会主义建设的政策缺乏经常的研究和教育。少数干部和士兵对当前农村工作中的许多问题，还有一些不正确的看法。
    上述的这些问题，必须通过整风和社会主义教育，认真地加以解决。
    在军队各级机关和学校的整风，可以采取大字报、辩论会、批评和自我批评的方式来进行。在连队，主要是进行社会主义教育和组织有领导的辩论。
    军队担负着国防和训练等繁重任务，在整风期间，必须注意不要松懈战斗准备和训练工作，特别是第一线部队。整风的目的，必须是为了提高社会主义觉悟，增强军队的团结，增强纪律，增强战斗力，而不是相反。
    （七）关于党和团
    目前我们的党已经有一千二百七十二万党员（内有预备党员二百八十万）。其中工人党员一百七十四万余人，农民党员八百五十万余人，知识分子党员一百八十八万余人，其他成分的党员六十万余人。
    在这次整风运动和反右派斗争中，大多数党员表现是好的。但是也暴露出不少问题。
    运动揭发了大量的官僚主义、宗派主义、主观主义的现象。一部分党员有严重的资产阶级个人主义，一味追求个人享受，计较名誉地位。也有极少数党员丧失革命意志，甚至堕落腐化，违法乱纪。
    在运动中，党内的右派分子暴露出来了。从党内发现这些资产阶级的代言人，这对我们党的巩固和纯洁具有重大意义。此外，还有一些党员有严重的右倾思想，对党有严重的不满情绪，在一些重大政策问题上同党有分歧，并且在这次斗争中表现政治动摇。
    党内所以发生这些严重问题是有其社会根源和思想根源的：（1）大部分党员是非无产阶级出身的。（2）党的组织发展较快，注意质量不够，而且思想政治工作也没跟上。（3）更重要的是，大多数党员是在胜利后的环境中入党的，他们入党的时候缺乏真正的社会主义觉悟，入党后长期处在同资产阶级合作的环境中，没有经过同资产阶级的直接的、尖锐的阶级斗争。在一百八十八万知识分子党员中，大部分没有经过生产劳动的锻炼，没有经过严重的阶级斗争的考验。
    在反右派斗争中，必须像对待党外右派分子一样，一视同仁地严肃地对待党内的右派分子。但是，现在还有一些同志，在反对党内的右派分子的斗争中，表现了比较严重的温情主义，特别是对一些应该划为右派的老党员更加惋惜、心软、下不了手。这种情绪必须加以克服。
    在运动转入第三第四阶段以后，在党内比在党外更加要抓紧整风的任务。除了领导干部的官僚主义、主观主义和宗派主义（包括地方主义、本位主义）的错误必须认真改正以外，还要在一般党员中批判右倾思想，批判各种资产阶级的和小资产阶级的思想。
    要加强思想政治教育工作。要在这次整风中，对每个党员在思想上、政治上普遍地进行一次检查。认真改正忽视思想政治教育、组织生活不健全、纪律松懈等缺点。
    除了叛徒和严重违法乱纪分子之外，在整风中，必须爱护一切党团员，用大力用诚心帮助他们改正错误缺点，改善工作方法，提高工作能力，提高思想政治水平。教育党员、干部一定要有朝气，一定要有革命的意志，一定要有大公无私、全心全意为人民服务的精神。
    必须结合这次整风运动，对所有党的基层组织认真地进行一次整顿。要通过这次整风运动，达到纯洁党的队伍，巩固党的组织的目的。
    对于党内的右派分子应该开除他们的党籍。如果因为情节较轻、转变较好而不开除，就可以摘掉他们的右派“帽子”。
    对于混入党内的各种坏分子，严重的违法乱纪分子，不可救药的腐化堕落的分子，有严重的资产阶级个人主义思想和行为、屡教不改的分子，必须清除出党。
    对于丧失革命意志、不起共产党员作用、经过批评教育仍不改正的人，应该劝他们退党或者清洗出党。
    在决定开除一个党员的时候，要将他们的错误事实核对确实，要遵守规定的手续，并且在开除他们以后，仍要在思想上、政治上关怀他们，指定专人同他们保持联系，进行考察和教育。
    对于预备党员要加强教育，并且进行严格的审查，防止不够党员条件的人转为正式党员。
    为了不断地调整党员的成分，补充党的新鲜血液，在整风运动和反右派斗争的基础上，在确实保证党员质量的条件下，可以有控制地把确实具备党员条件的人，特别是老工人和高级知识分子中的优秀分子，接收为党员。
    整风运动和反右派斗争考验了每一个党员，特别是考验了每一个干部。在这里，有必要谈一谈党的干部工作问题。
    我们党从来就是注意选拔优秀的工农分子和同工农群众有密切联系的知识分子担负各种的领导工作的。这是我们党的干部工作路线。
    我们在过去一个时期内，曾经过多地吸收了一批没有经过生产劳动锻炼和实际斗争考验的青年知识分子到各级领导机关工作，这是一个缺点。
    今后我们仍然应该从工人、农民的优秀分子中选拔干部，但是，他们应该是具有一定文化水平的工人和农民。同样应该从优秀的知识分子中选拔干部，但是他们应该是经过生产和斗争的锻炼，同工农群众有密切联系的知识分子。对于现有的没有经过实际斗争锻炼、没有基层工作经验的知识分子干部，应该有计划地分批地组织他们到农村、工厂中去劳动几年，或者到基层去做几年实际工作。凡是党、政府和群众团体的各级领导干部，都必须经过实际斗争的锻炼和取得基层工作的经验，缺少这一课的，必须补上这一课。文学、艺术、新闻、理论工作者和其他方面的宣传工作者也必须这样做。
    对于大学和中等专业学校毕业生，应该研究适当办法，首先分配他们到适合于他们的学科的生产单位中去，从事一年到几年的劳动以后，再根据他们的专长和在劳动中的表现，分配他们的工作。
    必须认真创造条件，使生产中的体力劳动者有提高文化科学知识的机会，并且使其中能够深造的一部分人，有升入大专学校的机会。
    认真地贯彻执行这样的干部工作路线，才能使党和国家培养和选拔干部的工作，建立在稳妥的基础之上，才能建立一支为共产主义事业奋斗的经得起风险的干部队伍。
    关于干部地方化的问题，是党的干部工作中必须正确解决的问题之一。在这个问题上现在有些糊涂观点，需要加以澄清。
    在全国解放初期，中央提出依靠大军、依靠老解放区干部建立新解放区的工作，这个方针是完全正确的。现在这些干部绝大部分工作是好的，已经同当地群众建立了联系，也就是说，他们已经地方化了，应该继续留下来工作。有少数人继续工作有困难，或者表现不好，应该动员他们回原籍或原工作地区参加生产，或作其他妥善安置。各地都应该提拔相当数量的本地干部作工作，这一点已经做了，还要继续做。现在，在多数地方，外来干部和本地干部的关系是融洽的，正常的。但是也有些同志，对于干部地方化缺乏正确的了解，有些人甚至有排斥外来干部的情绪。这是一种错误的地方主义的表现，应该在这次整风中加以纠正。
    必须指出，干部地方化并不是党的干部政策的最高原则。干部政策的最高原则首先是共产主义化，无论外来干部和本地干部都必须首先共产主义化，而地方主义却是同共产主义不相容的。本地干部的提拔仍然必须服从德才兼备的原则，而且在某些范围内还应该有适当的调剂。例如在县一级，清一色的本地干部就未必有利，更不必说县以上了。
    下面谈一谈青年团的问题。
    共产主义青年团是党的有力助手。各级党组织应该密切地关怀青年团的巩固和团员质量的提高。团的工作在近年来是有重大成绩的。但是在这次大鸣大放、反右派斗争中，在团员中也暴露出来不少的问题，特别是在团的干部政策和思想政治教育工作方面。必须结合这次整风运动，对团的组织和工作认真地进行一次整顿。
    对于犯有各种严重错误的共青团员，在进行组织处理的时候，基本上可以参照对犯各种错误的党员的处理原则进行处理，但是应该比党员稍放宽一些，应该更着重于教育。
    （八）改进工作，争取全胜
    改进工作和反右派具有同等重要意义，不可忽视任何一方面。
    党的领导能否巩固和加强，决定于党的本身，决定于领导是否正确，能否切实改正工作中的缺点和错误。反右派本身并不能消除我们的缺点和错误。
    在运动中，党内党外提的批评意见很多。这些批评和意见，绝大部分是正确的，有的虽较偏激，也并不是没有益处。
    在我们的工作中，反映得比较突出的毛病是：
    许多规章制度不合理，不切实际，相互矛盾。这影响到上下级之间、同级之间、这一部门和那一部门之间、这部分群众和那部分群众之间的关系，影响到生产的发展。这些东西有的是原来规定就不正确的，有的是原来正确，但因条件变化、应该改变而未及时改变的；有的是应该由各地去因地制宜作出规定，而不应该由中央统一规定的，有的是中央各部门在各自为政、互不联系的情况下作出的；有的是因为经验不足难于避免的，有的是完全可以避免的。这里有集中过多的现象，也有分散主义的现象。地方的某些规定，也有同样情形。
    许多领导机关和领导干部有严重的脱离实际、脱离群众的现象。负责同志忙于事务，接近群众太少，对群众中的问题不甚了解。许多不合理的生活制度，助长了干部脱离群众的倾向。不少干部骄傲自满，自以为是，不走群众路线，遇事不同群众商量。不少干部不愿同非党群众和非党人士来往。
    这些现象，不改不行，必须坚决改。
    我们是六亿人口的大国。把六亿人口团结起来，一心一德，建设社会主义，是一个伟大而艰巨的任务。为了实现这个任务，就需要坚持群众路线，正确地处理人民内部矛盾；就需要造成一个又有集中又有民主的，又有纪律又有自由的，又有统一意志、又有个人心情舒畅、生动活泼的政治局面。这样的政治局面可以使党和国家较为巩固，较为能够经受风险，较易于克服困难，有利于社会主义革命和社会主义建设的发展，有利于较快地实现我国的工业化和农业的现代化。
    要造成这样的政治局面，一方面必须贯彻进行反右派的斗争，加强对反革命分子的专政，巩固党的和国家的纪律，另一方面必须克服宗派主义、官僚主义、主观主义。
    为了整顿作风，改进工作，目前应该集中于以下三点：
    （1）克服宗派主义和特殊化的倾向。共产党员要大公无私，要同群众打成一片，同甘苦，共呼吸。党员同非党群众、党外人士要有亲密的联系，要多交朋友。干部同群众生活不要相差太多，取消形成干部特殊化的规定和制度，提倡艰苦朴素的风气。领导干部要接近下层、接近群众，干部要参加体力劳动。工农生活、城乡生活不要相差太多。生活水平的提高必须考虑到全国大多数人的情况，因此，在目前应该坚持实行合理的低工资制，尽量使大家都有饭吃。
    （2）改变制度上和组织上的一些不合理的规定，适当地调整党政之间和上下之间的集中统一和分工负责的关系。该集中的必须集中，该分散的必须分散，该下放的必须下放。过分集中的现象和分散主义的现象都要纠正。
    中央政治局向这次全会提出了有关工业、商业、财政体制的三个文件，主要的精神就是下放一部分权力，以利于发挥地方积极性，利于加强对各种企业和事业的领导，利于克服主观主义和官僚主义，同时也不至于损害统一领导和重点建设。这种改变，肯定比现行体制要好。但是，新的规定也不会是完满无缺的，需要在执行的过程中，加以补充和改进。值得指出的是，若干权力下放以后，还会出现一些新的矛盾，因而更需要加强计划和平衡的工作。这点，无论中央和地方都要注意。
    党政机关的工作人员和企业事业单位的非生产人员过多，机构庞大臃肿，也助长了主观主义和官僚主义的发展，必须大力紧缩。紧缩机构，减少脱产人员，这对于当前的国家建设事业有三方面的重大意义：第一、克服脱离实际、脱离群众的官僚主义和主观主义。第二、建立一支为共产主义事业奋斗的、经过锻炼、经得起风险的干部队伍。第三、节约大量的人力财力，加强劳动战线，加强基层，加速建设。因此，各个单位都应该迅速订出整编方案，动员大批人员到生产中去，到需要加强的基层单位中去，或者另行安置。许多不必要的和重叠的机构应该裁减合并和减少层次。为了紧缩机构，除了青年知识分子干部必须尽量参加生产劳动或者基层工作以外，其他干部也有一部分需要回到生产中去或者回到基层去。在我们的国家中，必须养成干部能上也能下、能脱离生产也能回到生产的优良风气。
    （3）在人民内部扩大民主生活，继续健全民主制度。处理人民内部的矛盾，必须坚持和风细雨的方法，坚持“团结——批评——团结”的方法。各级领导人员必须充分尊重人民群众的民主权利，经常倾听人民群众的呼声和要求，认真考虑各种合理的不同意见和反对意见，诚心诚意地接受群众的批评和监督，坚决地改正自己的缺点和错误。“凡属于人民内部的争论问题，只能用民主的方法去解决，只能用讨论的方法、批评的方法、说服教育的方法去解决，而不能用强制的、压服的方法去解决。”只有贯彻执行毛泽东同志的这个指示，才能鼓舞群众的热情，提高群众的觉悟，才能使群众在今后的政治生活中勇于批评和发表意见，敢于争辩和坚持真理。
    反右派斗争是为正确处理人民内部矛盾扫清道路的，我们决不能允许任何人用反右派斗争来阻塞人民内部的言路，用强制的压服的方法去解决人民内部的争论问题。为了教育广大群众，特别是为了解除中间分子的顾虑，反右派斗争本身也必须特别注意坚持摆事实、讲道理、以理服人的原则，防止简单粗暴，竭力避免夸大和片面性；对于中间分子和工人农民的错误观点，要采取耐心说服教育的方法；对于学术上的争论，尤其要反对轻率和武断。必须使反右派斗争的结果，有利于而不是不利于“百家争鸣、百花齐放”这个方针的贯彻执行，有利于而不是不利于培养人民群众敢讲话的空气。
    我们要争取运动的全胜。所谓全胜，就是要取得反右派斗争的胜利，取得改进工作的胜利，取得改造思想的胜利，并且使斗争的结果能够造成上面所说的那种政治局面。
    现在反右派斗争还需要深入和展开，在这方面我们已经取得决定性的胜利，而改进工作还只是开始。这是必须特别注意的。
    对于改进工作，有些地区、有些单位做得比较好。这些单位的经验证明，群众所提的意见，大部分是本单位可以马上接受和实现的，只有小部分问题需要由上级或中央统一解决。
    为了认真地改进工作，必须继续放手发动群众大鸣大放，让群众的意见得以无保留地充分发表。中央和地方的各部门、各单位，要成立由负责人主持的专门小组，广泛收集群众对于改进工作的意见，经过仔细研究之后，提出改进工作的计划和方案，逐步实行。各部门、各单位改进工作的情况，必须随时报告上级和中央。
    现在全国许多单位的整风运动已经转入改进工作的高潮，这些单位的工作情况出现了一个生气勃勃的新面貌。过去拖延多年没有克服的缺点，这次很快就克服了，过去需要长时期才能解决的问题，这次很短时间就解决了。群众的积极性大大提高，党和群众、干部和群众的联系大大加强。但是，也还有不少单位的领导同志，对于改进工作没有重视或者重视不够。有的人唯恐揭露缺点，运动一开始就不敢让群众鸣放；有的人在鸣放之后，又利用反右派把自己的错误掩盖起来，企图逃避整改，蒙混过关；个别的人甚至对提意见的人进行打击和报复。这些是不能允许的。在改进工作的过程中，我们对于群众的口号应该是：坚决地放，大胆地放，彻底地放；而对于领导人员的口号应该是：坚决地改，大胆地改，彻底地改。各级党委必须认真地加强对整风的第三阶段和第四阶段的领导，以求得运动的全胜。
