　　Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, 14th. The Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps of the Chinese People's Liberation Army has achieved a great cotton harvest on 300,000 mu of cotton fields in the Manas River basin reclamation area. Snow-like silver flowers bloom all over the banks of the Manas River. Tens of thousands of soldiers and workers are busily picking new cotton in the boundless cotton fields. Mountains of cotton are piled up in the drying yards of the farms, ready to be dried and put into storage. According to current on-site yield assessments, the average yield of seed cotton in the entire reclamation area is 220 to 250 jin per mu, an increase of 15% to 20% compared to last year. The area of cotton fields with a yield of more than 400 jin per mu has greatly exceeded that of 1956. This year, due to the absence of autumn frost so far, the pre-frost cotton accounts for more than 70%, and the fiber length, tenacity, and luster of the cotton are superior to previous years.
　　This year, the cotton in the Manas River basin suffered severe natural disasters. In mid-April, a Siberian cold wave hit the area, freezing the fields, and causing rain and snow. Until late May, the air and ground temperatures here were very low, and some of the newly sown cotton seeds were frozen to death, while most remained underground for 30 to 40 days without sprouting. In order to save the cotton seedlings, the farms mobilized thousands of soldiers and workers to manually "liberate" the cotton seedlings in large areas of cotton fields. During the seedling stage, the farms carried out deep cultivation in advance and applied more phosphate fertilizer to promote seedling growth. Anjihai, Wula Usu, and Chepaizi farms actively dug wells, searched for springs, and found water sources due to spring drought and water shortage, and implemented an economical water use system, enabling most cotton fields to survive the drought. This year, the entire reclamation area universally promoted the advanced cotton planting technologies proposed by Soviet expert Gorelov, such as horizontal thinning, infiltration irrigation, and retaining oil strips, which played an important role in ensuring increased cotton production and disaster resistance.

### 推广苏联植棉技术战胜自然灾害  玛纳斯河垦区棉花大丰收

　　推广苏联植棉技术战胜自然灾害
    玛纳斯河垦区棉花大丰收
    新华社乌鲁木齐14日电　中国人民解放军新疆生产建设部队玛纳斯河流域垦区三十万亩棉花大丰收，雪浪般的银花开遍玛纳斯河两岸。成万名战士和职工正在一望无际的棉田里紧张地收摘新花，各农场的晒花场上堆积如山的棉花正在晾晒，即将入库。根据目前部分田间产量鉴定，整个垦区的棉花平均每亩可产籽棉二百二十斤到二百五十斤，比去年增加15％到20％左右；单位面积产量在四百斤以上的棉田大大超过1956年。今年由于至今未降秋霜，霜前花达70％以上，花絮的绒长、韧度和光泽都优于往年。
    今年玛纳斯河流域的棉花曾经受到严重的自然灾害。4月中旬，西伯利亚寒潮侵袭这个地区，田地冰冻，并有雨雪。直到5月下旬，这里的气温和地温都很低，刚下种的棉籽一部分被冻死，大部分在地下三十天到四十天不能出土。为了挽救棉苗，各农场动员了成千上万的战士和职工，在大面积棉田里用人工“解放”棉苗。在幼苗期间，各农场提前进行了深度中耕，增施磷肥，促进幼苗生长。安集海、乌拉乌苏和车排子等农场由于春旱缺水，积极打井、挖泉、寻找水源，并实行了经济用水制度，使大部棉田都度过了旱期。今年整个垦区普遍推行了苏联专家果列洛夫提出的横向间苗，浸润灌溉，保留油条等先进植棉技术，对保证棉花增产、抗灾起了重要作用。
