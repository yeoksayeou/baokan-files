Adopt Effective Measures to Prevent and Control Endemic Diseases

It is currently the season for Keshan disease outbreaks. This is a widespread and severe endemic disease. Heilongjiang Province has established a prevention and control command structure, mobilizing and organizing forces from all sides to fully carry out prevention and control work. A special meeting is about to be held to study Keshan disease prevention and control, and to summarize research results. Some areas of Inner Mongolia, Jilin, and Gansu provinces are also conducting Keshan disease prevention and control work. The health departments of Shaanxi Province are conducting a comprehensive survey of various endemic diseases. Many counties have essentially grasped the types and distribution of endemic diseases in their regions, and are beginning to organize materials and formulate prevention and control plans. This is an urgent matter concerning the health of millions of people and must be done well with urgent prevention and control methods.

Keshan disease, Kaschin-Beck disease, and endemic goiter are the most serious endemic diseases harming the people. Existing survey data indicate that Keshan disease and Kaschin-Beck disease are prevalent in the vast mountainous areas and rural areas of nine provinces in China, including Jilin, Heilongjiang, Hebei, Inner Mongolia, Shaanxi, Gansu, Shanxi, and Henan. The epidemic area of endemic goiter is even wider, with about 20 provinces and autonomous regions in the country having this disease. The number of people suffering from endemic goiter is highest in mountainous areas. In the mountainous counties along the Taihang Mountains and Yanshan Mountains in Hebei Province, the incidence rate is generally above 50%. These endemic diseases seriously endanger the health of the broad masses of working people in the above-mentioned areas and directly affect production, especially the construction of mountainous areas.

These many types of endemic diseases have been considerably reduced over the past few years through our key prevention and control efforts. For Kaschin-Beck disease, many regions have established specialized prevention and control agencies, trained a certain number of cadres, and focused on implementing prevention and control measures. In particular, since the Ministry of Health convened a symposium on Kaschin-Beck disease in June 1956 and the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Agriculture jointly issued the "Instructions on the Prevention and Control of Kaschin-Beck Disease" at the beginning of this year, the prevention and control work has made new progress. For Keshan disease, some key epidemic areas, such as Heilongjiang and Gansu, have not only promoted comprehensive prevention measures, but also organized a large number of medical personnel every outbreak season, adopting the method of "dividing villages and guarding, focusing on stationing," actively rescuing acute patients, and training a large number of health activists and rescuers among the masses, which has played a certain role in reducing the occurrence of Keshan disease. For endemic goiter, more than ten provinces including Hebei, Liaoning, Shanxi, Henan, Shaanxi, and Gansu have organized forces to conduct investigations and prevention and control. For example, in addition to promoting the method of iodized salt in more than ten epidemic counties this year for prevention and control, the Health Department of Hebei Province also plans to use various methods of traditional Chinese and Western medicine to treat more than 20,000 patients. In terms of scientific research, a series of studies have been conducted on the etiology of Kaschin-Beck disease and Keshan disease in recent years. With the assistance of Soviet experts, it has been preliminarily confirmed that "foodborne fungal poisoning" is the main cause of Kaschin-Beck disease. Although the etiology of Keshan disease has not yet been clarified, some new clues have been discovered. These undoubtedly create favorable conditions for continuing to carry out larger-scale research work in the future. We require areas with these epidemic diseases to make plans in a timely manner, organize forces from all sides, and actively carry out prevention and control.

To prevent and control endemic diseases, especially Keshan disease and Kaschin-Beck disease, comprehensive measures must be taken. For Kaschin-Beck disease, we must earnestly study the Soviet experience in prevention and control. For Keshan disease, we must actively take measures from many aspects to prevent and control it, striving to prevent its occurrence and reduce the mortality rate. According to the experience of the past few years, all localities should also pay attention to combining the patriotic health campaign, making efforts to prevent cold and smoke, improve living conditions, change water quality, improve nutrition, and strive to carry out comprehensive prevention measures such as catching rats and eliminating insects, paying attention to the early detection of acute patients, and timely rescue and treatment. For endemic goiter, domestic and foreign experience has proved that the use of iodine preparations has a good preventive effect. Therefore, it is necessary to gradually, widely, and continuously promote various simple and easy-to-implement prevention methods in the epidemic areas of endemic goiter, combined with the living habits of the local people. At the same time, it is also necessary to give full play to the strengths of various therapies of traditional Chinese and Western medicine.

Since the epidemic range and number of patients of these three endemic diseases have not yet been clarified, and there is not much experience in prevention and control work, we must adhere to the working steps and methods of conducting investigations, research, and prevention and control simultaneously in prevention and control work. For the deployment and requirements of prevention and control work, all localities must consider their actual conditions and specific conditions and move forward steadily. In areas where prevention and control work has a certain foundation, prevention and control should continue to be carried out in depth and comprehensively, and attention should be paid to summarizing experience. In areas where prevention and control work still lacks a foundation, it should start from the point and gradually expand from point to surface. In prevention and control work, it is also necessary to pay attention to cultivating typical examples, creating new experiences and new methods, summarizing, exchanging, and promoting them at any time to improve the level of prevention and control work.

Strengthening the prevention and control force of endemic diseases is an important issue in prevention and control work, and the role of specialized prevention and control institutions for endemic diseases must be fully utilized. Health administrative departments in endemic areas should pay attention to deploying medical personnel with higher technical levels to work in specialized prevention and control institutions for endemic diseases, so that prevention and control institutions can truly become the technical guidance core of prevention and control work for endemic diseases. It is also necessary to organize Chinese and Western medical personnel in endemic areas to actively participate in prevention and control, and expand the prevention and control force.

The prevention and control of endemic diseases is a mass work, and many prevention and control measures, especially preventive measures, must be implemented through the masses. Therefore, in prevention and control work, it is necessary to mobilize the masses, rely on the masses, use various methods to conduct extensive publicity to the masses, explain preventive measures, impart basic knowledge of prevention and control of endemic diseases, so that the masses can understand the prevention methods and mobilize them to actively participate in the struggle to prevent and control endemic diseases.

At present, the speed of progress in scientific research on these three endemic diseases is far from meeting the needs of prevention and control work, and this situation must be changed. Scientific research institutions, medical colleges, and specialized prevention and control institutions that are currently responsible for the research tasks of the etiology and prevention and control measures of Kaschin-Beck disease and Keshan disease should cooperate closely, assist each other, and make redoubled efforts to strive to make new achievements as soon as possible.

In order to ensure the smooth progress of the prevention and control of endemic diseases, the party committees and government leading organs at all levels in endemic areas must strengthen leadership and include it in the plan. In these areas where endemic diseases are serious, the party committees and governments should establish special leading groups or committees to strengthen specific leadership. Under the unified leadership of the party committees and governments, the health, culture and education, agriculture, food, salt affairs, and supply and marketing cooperatives must also closely cooperate, act in coordination, and jointly fight to eliminate these endemic diseases that seriously endanger the people.

    采取有效办法防治地方病
    目前正是克山病发作的季节。这是一种流行较广、发病较剧烈的地方病。黑龙江省已经成立防治指挥机构，动员和组织各方面的力量，全力进行防治；并且即将举行专门会议，研究克山病防治工作，总结研究工作的成果。内蒙古和吉林、甘肃等省的部分地区，也正在进行克山病的防治工作。陕西省卫生部门现在正对各种地方病进行全面调查。许多县份已经基本掌握了本地区地方病的种类、分布情况，并且着手整理资料，制订防治计划。这是关系千百万人民健康的一件紧要的大事，一定要采取紧急的防治方法，保证做好。
    克山病、大骨节病和地方性甲状腺肿是危害人民最严重的地方病。现有的调查资料说明，克山病和大骨节病流行于我国吉林、黑龙江、河北、内蒙古、陕西、甘肃、山西、河南等九个省的广大山岳地带和农村中。地方性甲状腺肿的流行区域更为广泛，全国约有二十多个省、自治区有这种病。地方性甲状腺肿以山区的患病人数为最多。河北省沿太行山脉和燕山山脉的山区县份，发病率一般均在50％以上。这几种地方病，在上述地区内，严重地危害着广大劳动人民的健康，并直接影响生产，尤其影响山区的建设。
    这许多种地方病几年来经过我们的重点防治，已经有相当的减轻。对于大骨节病，许多地区都建立了专业防治机构，培养了一定数量的干部，并且重点地推行了防治措施。特别是从1956年6月卫生部召开了大骨节病座谈会和今年年初卫生部、农业部联合发布了“关于防治大骨节病的指示”以后，防治工作又有了新的进展。对于克山病，某些重点流行区，例如黑龙江、甘肃不仅推行了综合性的预防措施，并且每当发病季节，都组织大批医务人员，采用“分村把守，重点驻在”的办法，积极抢救急型病人，训练了群众中的大批卫生积极分子和抢救员，这对于减少克山病的发生起了一定作用。对于地方性甲状腺肿，河北、辽宁、山西、河南、陕西、甘肃等十多个省都组织力量进行了调查和防治。例如河北省卫生厅今年除了在十多个流行县份推行加碘食盐的办法进行防治以外，还拟采用中西医的各种疗法治疗二万多名病人。在科学研究工作方面，几年来对大骨节病和克山病的病因进行了一系列的研究，约请苏联专家协助，初步肯定了“食物性真菌中毒”是大骨节病的主要致病原因；克山病的病因虽然至今还没有弄清楚，但是已经发现了一些新的线索。这些无疑地都为今后继续进行更大规模的研究工作创造了有利条件。我们要求有这些流行病的地区，及时地作出规划，组织各方面的力量，积极地进行防治。
    防治地方病，特别是防治克山病和大骨节病，必须采取综合性的措施。对于大骨节病，要认真学习苏联的防治经验。对于克山病，更要积极地从多方面采取措施进行防治，力求防止它的发生，减少死亡率。根据几年来的经验，各地还要注意结合爱国卫生运动，努力防寒、防烟，改善居住条件，改变水质，改善营养；并且要努力进行捕鼠、灭虫等综合性的预防措施，注意早期发现急型病人，及时抢救治疗。对于地方性甲状腺肿，国内外的经验都证明，用碘剂防治效果良好，因此必须逐步地在地方性甲状腺肿的流行地区，结合当地人民群众的生活习惯，广泛地、长期地推行各种简便易行的预防方法；同时也要发挥中西医的各种疗法的长处。
    由于目前对这三种地方病的流行范围和患病人数还没有摸清，防治工作经验还不多，在防治工作中必须坚持边调查、边研究、边防治的工作步骤和方法。对于防治工作的部署和要求，各地必须考虑到当地的实际情况和具体条件，稳步前进。在防治工作已有一定基础的地区，应当继续深入、全面地展开防治，并注意总结经验；在防治工作还缺乏基础的地区，应当从点做起，由点到面，逐步扩大。在防治工作中，还要注意培养典型，创造新的经验和新的方法，随时总结，交流推广，以提高防治工作的水平。
    加强地方病的防治力量是防治工作中的重要问题，必须充分发挥地方病专业防治机构的作用。地方病流行区的卫生行政部门，应注意调配具有较高技术水平的医务人员，充实到地方病专业防治机构中去工作，使防治机构真正成为地方病防治工作的技术指导核心；还必须组织地方病流行地区的中西医务人员积极参加防治，扩大防治力量。
    防治地方病是一项群众性工作，许多防治措施，尤其是预防措施，都要通过群众去实行。因此，在防治工作中必须发动群众，依靠群众，利用各种方式向群众进行广泛宣传，讲解预防措施，传授防治地方病的基本知识，使群众能够了解预防的办法，动员他们积极地投入防治地方病的斗争。
    目前对这三种地方病的科学研究工作的进展速度，还远不能适应防治工作的需要，这种情形必须改变。当前担当大骨节病和克山病的病因学以及防治措施的研究任务的科学研究机关、医学院校，以及专业防治机构，应当通力合作，互相协助，加倍努力，争取及早作出新的成绩。
    为了保证地方病防治工作的顺利进行，地方病流行地区的各级党委和政府领导机关，必须加强领导，把它列入规划。在这些地方病流行严重的地区，党委和政府应该成立专门的领导小组或委员会，加强具体领导。在党委和政府的统一领导下，卫生、文教、农业、粮食、盐务以及供销合作等部门，还必须紧密配合，协同动作，共同为扑灭这些严重危害人民的地方病而斗争。
