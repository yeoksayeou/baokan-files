Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 8th – The living standards of the Soviet people are now significantly higher than before the war. This was recently proven by the Minister of Commerce of the Soviet Union, Pavlov, in the "Soviet Trade Newspaper."

Over the past decade, the Soviet Union has continuously increased the real wages of workers and the income of collective farmers, and has repeatedly lowered prices. Compared with 1940, prices are still 38% higher in 1956, but the real wages of workers have increased by 82%, so people can buy more goods and live better. The number of people eating fish and meat has about doubled, so the need for bread has actually decreased slightly. The amount of fabric purchased by worker family members increased by 75%, and by collective farmer family members by 111%. On average, each person purchased 914 rubles worth of goods from state-owned stores and cooperatives in 1940, 1,844 rubles in 1955, and will reach 2,175 rubles this year (at 1940 prices). This year, 17.5 million tons of milk and dairy products will be sold, an increase of 6.1 million tons compared to two years ago; 500,000 tons of animal oil will be sold, an increase of 149,000 tons compared to two years ago. The increase in these two years is greater than in the previous five years. More than 1.2 million cameras will be sold this year, more than 750,000 television sets, and 23.93 million watches. Before the revolution, there was only one bicycle in one district or even one county, but now the whole of the Soviet Union averages one bicycle for every three families. This year, 3.4 million bicycles will be sold, which is more than the production of the United States, France, and Italy combined.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 8th – According to Soviet newspapers: The commodity turnover in the Soviet Union in the first eight months of this year reached an unprecedented speed in the history of Soviet trade. During this period, Soviet residents received goods worth 398 billion rubles, an increase of 15% over the same period last year. Calculated on a per capita basis, the commodity turnover of state-owned and cooperative commercial networks in the Soviet Union this year will reach 2,175 rubles per person, which is 1,261 rubles more than in 1940 before the war (at comparable prices).

With the growth of consumer goods production and the increase in people's purchasing power, the domestic trade network and commodity turnover in the Soviet Union have grown significantly in recent years. According to statistics, the number of stores and restaurants last year reached 616,400, an increase of 25% compared with 1940 before the war.

As early as 1953, the increase in retail commodity turnover in the Soviet Union (at comparable prices) exceeded the total retail commodity turnover in 1913 before the October Revolution. In 1956, the value of goods sold by state-owned and cooperative commercial networks alone reached 540.8 billion rubles, 43.8 billion rubles more than in 1955.

The seven price reductions for consumer goods implemented by the Soviet Union after the war played an important role in increasing people's purchasing power. Goods that residents could buy for 1,000 rubles in 1947 can now be bought for 430 rubles.

In the Soviet era, with the changes in the distribution of national productive forces, huge changes have also taken place in the geographical distribution of commerce, and the trade of formerly backward national republics has developed particularly rapidly. Before the October Revolution, 94% of Russia's total industrial commodity turnover was concentrated in the central region, which accounted for only a quarter of the country's total population. After the October Revolution, if the commodity turnover of the entire Soviet Union increased 45 times from 1928 to 1956, then the Tajik Republic increased 89 times, Kazakhstan 87 times, Armenia 86 times, Uzbekistan 65 times, Kyrgyzstan 73 times, and Georgia 54 times. At the same time, a large part of the commodities sold in various republics are produced in the republics themselves.

After the October Revolution, the commodity turnover in the Soviet countryside increased very rapidly, and there were also fundamental changes in the composition of commodities in the countryside. In the past, salt, kerosene, matches, soap, and cotton fabrics accounted for more than one-third of the commodity turnover in the countryside; but in 1956, the proportion of these commodities accounted for only 9% (although the absolute quantity is also increasing), while other high-end consumer goods have seen significant growth.

It is estimated that the total commodity turnover of the Soviet Union this year will reach at least 600 billion rubles, an increase of 57 billion to 60 billion rubles compared with last year. Compared with 1955, the sales of various major foods in the Soviet Union this year are expected to increase by a quarter to more than a half. Compared with 1950, the increase in the sales of national industrial consumer goods this year is: woolen fabrics - 0.8 times, silk fabrics - 4 times, bicycles - 4 times, televisions - 62 times, refrigerators - 295 times, washing machines - 1446 times.

    实际工资逐年增加　国内贸易空前发展
    苏联人民的日子越过越美好
    本报莫斯科8日电　苏联人民生活水平现在比战前有显著提高。苏联商业部部长巴甫洛夫不久前在“苏维埃商业报”上加以证明。
    十年来苏联不断提高职工的实际工资和集体农民的收入，多次降低物价。以1956年比1940年，物价仍高38％，但职工的实际工资却增长了82％，所以人民能购买更多的物品，生活得更好。人民中吃鱼肉的增加了一倍左右，所以对面包的需要反而稍有降低。职工家庭成员购买的布匹增加75％，集体农民家庭成员增加111％。平均每个人在1940年从国营商店和合作社购买了九百一十四卢布的商品，1955年一千八百四十四卢布，今年将达二千一百七十五卢布（按1940年价格）。今年将销售一千七百五十万吨牛乳和乳制品，比两年前增销六百一十万吨；将销售五十万吨动物油，比两年前增销十四万九千吨。这两年增长的比以前五年还多。今年销售的照相机将达一百二十万多件，电视机将达七十五万多件，手表将达二千三百九十三万只。革命前一区甚至一县才有一辆脚踏车，现在全苏平均三家有一辆。今年将销售三百四十万辆脚踏车，这比美、法、意三国生产的还要多。
    新华社莫斯科8日电　据苏联报纸报道：苏联今年头八个月的商品流转达到了苏维埃贸易史上空前未有的速度。在这一时期，苏联居民得到了价值达三千九百八十亿卢布的商品，比去年同一时期增加了15％。如果按人口平均计算，苏联今年国营和合作社商业网的商品流转额将达到每人两千一百七十五卢布，比战前的1940年多一千二百六十一个卢布（按比较价格计算）。
    随着消费品生产的增长和人民购买力的提高，苏联近几年来的国内贸易网和商品流转额有了显著的增长。据统计，去年的商店和餐厅数目达到六十一万六千四百个，比战前1940年增加了25％。
    早在1953年，苏联零售商品流转额的增加数（按比较价格计算），就超过了十月革命前1913年的零售商品的流转总额。1956年仅国营和合作社商业网出售商品的价值就达到了五千四百零八亿卢布，比1955年多四百三十八亿卢布。
    苏联在战后实行的七次减低消费品价格的措施，对于提高人民购买力起了重要的作用。在1947年居民用一千卢布买到的商品，现在用四百三十卢布就可以买到了。
    在苏维埃政权时代，随着国家生产力分布的变化，在商业的地理分布上也发生了巨大的变化，过去落后的民族共和国的贸易事业得到了特别迅速的发展。在十月革命前，俄国全部工业商品流转额的94％集中在人口仅占全国总人口的四分之一的中部地区。在十月革命后，如果说1928—1956年全苏联商品流转额增加了四十五倍，那么，塔吉克共和国却增加了八十九倍，哈萨克——八十七倍，亚美尼亚——八十六倍，乌兹别克——六十五倍，吉尔吉斯——七十三倍，格鲁吉亚——五十四倍。同时，各共和国所销售的商品有很大一部分都是本共和国生产的。
    十月革命后苏联农村的商品流转额增加的速度非常快，在农村商品的组成方面也有了根本的改变。过去食盐、煤油、火柴、肥皂和棉织品占农村商品流转额的三分之一还多；但在1956年这些商品的比重只占9％（虽然绝对数量也在增加），而其他高级消费品却有了显著的增长。
    预计，今年苏联的商品流转总额至少将达到六千亿卢布，比去年将增加五百七十亿到六百亿卢布。同1955年比较，今年苏联出售的各种主要食品预计将增加四分之一到二分之一以上。同1950年比较，今年全国工业消费品出售额的增加倍数是：毛织品——零点八倍，丝织品——四倍，脚踏车——四倍，电视机——六十二倍，冰箱——二百九十五倍，洗衣机——一千四百四十六倍。
