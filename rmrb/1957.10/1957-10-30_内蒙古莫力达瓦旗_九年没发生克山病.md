    Morin Dawa Daur Autonomous Banner, Inner Mongolia
    No Cases of Keshan Disease for Nine Years
    In the Nootoks (districts) of Gegen, Tengke, Arla, and Bayan in the Morin Dawa Daur Autonomous Banner of Inner Mongolia, there have been no cases of Keshan disease for nine years.

    Before liberation, the Daur people here suffered severely from the prevalence of Keshan disease due to a lack of hygiene knowledge and medical treatment. Many people died from Keshan disease.

    After liberation, the Party and the government sent Keshan disease prevention and control teams to lead the Daur people in carrying out patriotic health campaigns. Furthermore, four health clinics and two health centers were established in these areas. In addition to daily consultations and treatments, they were stationed in villages during the Keshan disease high-risk periods to carry out prevention and treatment. The Daur people now know the methods of preventing Keshan disease, have improved their houses and stoves, and pay attention to their diet and accommodation. It is because of this that there have been no cases of Keshan disease for the past nine years since liberation.

    内蒙古莫力达瓦旗
    九年没发生克山病
    内蒙古莫力达瓦旗葛根、腾克、阿尔拉、巴彦等努图克（区），九年没发生克山病。
    解放前，这里的达呼尔族人民，因为缺乏卫生知识和没有医药治疗，使得克山病流行的很严重。许多人得克山病死去。
    解放以后，党和政府派来了克山病防疫工作队，领导达呼尔族人民开展了爱国卫生运动。并且在这些地区成立了四个卫生所和二个保健站，除平日诊疗外，每到克山病危险期，就下各屯驻屯防治。达呼尔族人民现在知道了克山病的预防方法，改进了房屋炉灶，注意了食宿。正因为这样，解放后九年来没有发生克山病了。
