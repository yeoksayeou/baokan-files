    Three Hundred Western Doctors Begin to Master Traditional Chinese Medicine Theory; Beijing and Six Other Cities Organize Western Doctors to Study Traditional Chinese Medicine with Success
    (Our dispatch) Nearly three hundred senior Western doctors and medical school graduates participating in full-time study at the "Traditional Chinese Medicine Research Classes" in Beijing, Chengdu, Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangzhou, and Wuhan have achieved great results after a year of study.
    Currently, each class has completed courses such as *Neijing* (The Yellow Emperor's Classic of Internal Medicine), *Shanghan Lun* (Treatise on Cold Damage), *Jingui Yaolue* (Synopsis of Prescriptions of the Golden Chamber), Materia Medica, Formulas, and Diagnostics. After examinations, the majority achieved good results. The vast majority of students have a clear and systematic understanding of the spiritual essence of classical works of traditional Chinese medicine, recognizing that traditional Chinese medicine not only has its theoretical system but also a relatively complete set of diagnostic and treatment methods. They also have a deeper understanding of the holistic view, preventive medicine thinking, and characteristics of "syndrome differentiation and treatment" based on the Eight Principles, Four Examinations, and Eight Treatment Methods in traditional Chinese medicine. Some students have also written academic papers with a certain level of quality and conducted preliminary research work in conjunction with clinical medical practice.
    Traditional Chinese medicine teachers said that this is an effect that could not be achieved by traditional Chinese medicine apprenticeship in the past. It is estimated that soon, these Western doctors can meet the requirements of systematically mastering the basic theory of traditional Chinese medicine and certain clinical medical techniques, and most of the students can be trained as TCM teaching and research talents after graduation.
    The preliminary experience of the six Traditional Chinese Medicine Research Classes proves that the Traditional Chinese Medicine Research Class is currently the best organizational form for Western doctors to learn traditional Chinese medicine. In terms of curriculum, starting from the classical works of traditional Chinese medicine is the fundamental path for Western doctors to study traditional Chinese medicine full-time. In addition, we should pay attention to teaching observation and production practice, which are the most important links in connecting theory with practice and the key to the success or failure of teaching.
    The preliminary achievements of these six Western doctors studying traditional Chinese medicine classes not only powerfully prove the correctness of the Party's policy on traditional Chinese medicine and that traditional Chinese medicine indeed has infinitely rich and valuable content, and that Western doctors learning traditional Chinese medicine is not a waste of manpower, material resources, and time, but also laid a good foundation and created experience for continuing to carry out the work of Western doctors learning traditional Chinese medicine.

    三百名西医开始掌握中医理论
    北京等六城市组织西医学习中医有成绩
    本报讯　参加在北京、成都、上海、天津、广州、武汉六个“中医研究班”脱离生产学习的，近三百名高级西医和医学院校毕业生，经过了一年的学习，取得很大成绩。
    目前各班已经学完了内经、伤寒、金匮、本草、方剂、诊断等课程，经过考查考试，大多数成绩良好。绝大多数学员对于中医经典著作的精神实质已有了明确的、系统的概念，认识到中医不但有它的理论体系，而且有一套较完整的诊断治疗法则；对于中医的整体观，预防医学思想，八纲、四诊、八法的“辩证论治”等等特点，也有了较深刻的理解。有些学员还写出了具有一定水平的学术论文，和结合临床医疗进行初步的研究工作。
    中医教师说，这是过去中医带徒所不能收到的效果。估计不久，这些西医可以达到系统掌握中医基本理论和一定的临床医疗技术的要求，大部分学员毕业后可以培养成为中医教学研究人才。
    六个中医研究班的初步经验证明：中医研究班是目前西医学习中医最好的组织形式。在学习课程方面，从中医经典著作学起，是西医脱产学习中医的根本道路。此外，应当重视教学见习和生产实习，这是理论联系实际最重要的环节，也是教学成败的关键。
    这六个西医学习中医班的初步成就，不仅有力地证明党的中医政策的正确，中医确实有着无限丰富、宝贵的内容，西医学习中医不是人力、物力和时间的浪费，而且为继续开展西医学习中医的工作打下了良好的基础，创造了经验。
