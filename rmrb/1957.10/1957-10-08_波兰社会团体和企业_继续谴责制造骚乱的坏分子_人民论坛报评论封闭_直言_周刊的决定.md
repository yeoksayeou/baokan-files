Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, 7th dispatch: Polish mass organizations and enterprises continue to sternly condemn the provocative elements responsible for the recent riot in Warsaw.

The Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Polish Socialist Youth League issued a statement on the 6th, fully endorsing the decision of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party to close the "Straight Talk" weekly. The statement also said that the Socialist Youth League has accepted and will continue to accept the leadership of the United Workers' Party. The Central Committee of the Polish Student Union passed a resolution on the same day, demanding the rioters be severely condemned. The Polish Association of Science and Technology Workers also issued a statement endorsing the decision of the Central Committee of the United Workers' Party.

The employees of the famous Zeran Automobile Factory in Warsaw also passed a resolution opposing the riots. The resolution specifically refuted the rumors spread by Western radio stations, pointing out that the Party committee and employees of this factory fully support the decision of the Secretariat of the Party Central Committee.

According to the Polish News Agency, riots continued in Warsaw for the past two nights. On the evening of the 5th, a group of thugs threw stones at the police on Constitution Square. The police dispersed them and detained about 150 people. No students participated in this riot. On the evening of the 6th, a group of thugs gathered near the parade ground to attack police vehicles and attempted to smash the glass windows of trams. A police patrol quickly restored order and arrested several thugs.

Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, 6th dispatch: The "People's Forum Newspaper" published an editorial on the 5th, commenting on the decision of the Polish United Workers' Party to order the suspension of the "Straight Talk" weekly.

The editorial pointed out that the publication contained many articles, including a complete negation of the achievements of the People's Republic of Poland over the past thirteen years, opposition to the principles of proletarian internationalism in an open or disguised manner, and many articles and reports targeted the unity and solidarity of the Party, and demanded freedom of action for anti-socialist forces. This reflects that the staff of the "Straight Talk" weekly editorial department has fallen into the bourgeois position. Actual behavior proves that the editorial department of this weekly is increasingly transgressing and moving towards an anti-socialist stance. This confirms the decision that has become the subject of today's announcement by the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party.

The editorial said that in the further democratization, constructive discussions, and active criticism of many shortcomings in our lives, our Party and its leadership will not tolerate any activities that oppose the foundations of our people's democratic system. No one in Poland can think that freedom will pave the way for reactionary and backward social forces.

All this shows why the decision to close the "Straight Talk" weekly would prompt the most immature, politically disoriented, and openly reactionary student groups in certain Warsaw universities to try to provoke excessive actions, which are not without the active participation of rascals.

It is even more noteworthy that the vast majority of Warsaw youth did not participate in this reactionary atrocity. The youth from many factories in Warsaw, who make up the workers' militia, made great contributions in curbing this atrocity that disrupted public order and tranquility. People in many factories and institutions have condemned this atrocity in resolutions and mass rallies.

The editorial concluded that there is no room for reactionary riots and recklessness in Poland. We have too many problems to solve and too many tasks to accomplish. We must not waste time messing around. Those who disturb the peace and order of our country must realize that they must be held responsible for their actions.

### 波兰社会团体和企业  继续谴责制造骚乱的坏分子  人民论坛报评论封闭“直言”周刊的决定

    波兰社会团体和企业
    继续谴责制造骚乱的坏分子
    人民论坛报评论封闭“直言”周刊的决定
    据新华社华沙7日电　波兰群众团体和企业继续严厉谴责挑衅分子最近制造的华沙骚乱事件。
    波兰社会主义青年联盟中央书记处6日发表声明，完全拥护波兰统一工人党中央书记处关于封闭“直言”周刊的决定。声明中还说，社会主义青年联盟过去和将来都接受统一工人党的领导。波兰学生联合会中央委员会在同一天通过决议，要求严厉谴责骚乱的制造者。波兰科学技术工作者协会也发表了拥护统一工人党中央的决定的声明。
    华沙著名的泽兰汽车厂的职工也通过了反对骚乱的决议。决议特别驳斥了西方电台散布的谣言，指出这个工厂的党委和职工完全拥护党中央书记处的决定。
    据波兰通讯社报道，过去两天晚上华沙继续有骚乱发生。5日晚，一伙暴徒在宪法广场向民警投掷石块，民警驱散了他们，拘留了约一百五十人。这次骚乱没有学生参加。6日晚，一群暴徒集结在阅兵广场附近攻击民警所乘车辆，并且企图打毁电车上的玻璃窗，民警巡逻队迅速恢复了秩序，拘捕了若干暴徒。
    据新华社华沙6日电  “人民论坛报”5日发表社论，评论波兰统一工人党命令“直言”周刊停刊的决定。
    社论指出，刊物中有许多文章，包括对波兰人民共和国十三年来成就的完全否定，用公开或伪装方式反对无产阶级国际主义原则，许多文章和报道针对着党的统一和团结，并为反社会主义力量要求行动自由。这反映了“直言”周刊编辑部工作人员已陷入资产阶级的立场。实际行为证明了这个周刊的编辑部愈来愈越轨而趋向于反社会主义立场。这就确定了成为波兰统一工人党中央委员会今天公告中说的主题的这个决定。
    社论说，在进一步民主化，进行建设性的讨论，并且对我们生活中的很多缺点进行积极的批评的时候，我们的党和它的领导将不能容忍反对我们人民民主制度基础的任何活动。不能让波兰的任何人认为自由将为反动和倒退的社会力量铺平道路。
    所有这一切都表明，封闭“直言”周刊的决定为什么会促使某些华沙高等学校的最不成熟、政治上迷失方向和公开反动的学生集团设法挑起过分的行动，这种行动并不是没有无赖的积极参加。
    更加值得注意的是：华沙的广大青年并未参加这种反动暴行。组成工人民兵队的来自华沙许多工厂的青年，在遏止这次扰乱公共秩序和宁静的暴行中作出了很大的贡献。许多工厂和机关内的人员纷纷在决议中和群众集会上谴责了这次暴行。
    社论最后说，在波兰是没有反动骚乱和胡作非为的余地的。我们要解决的问题和要完成的任务太多了。我们决不能浪费时间去胡闹。那些扰乱我们国家的和平和秩序的人们必须认识到，他们必须要对他们的行为负责。
