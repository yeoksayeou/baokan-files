　　Soviet Advanced Experience Is Our Direction
　　National Model Worker of Industry　Li Yong
　　I am a railway worker. As the 40th anniversary of the Great October Revolution approaches, I want to talk about the significant assistance of the Soviet government and Soviet railway worker brothers to China's railway transportation and construction. In the past, under the assistance of Soviet comrades, the China Changchun Railway became a model railway in our country; now, under the assistance of Soviet comrades, the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge has been successfully completed ahead of schedule, and has also created a new experience in the history of world bridge construction with the pipe pile drilling method. Many of our major achievements in railway transportation and construction, like all major construction achievements in the country, owe a share to the Soviet government and the Soviet people.
　　On the eve of this great festival, I cannot help but miss my best friend, Soviet model locomotive driver Comrade Brazhnov.
　　In October 1949, I represented railway workers across the country to participate in the 32nd anniversary of the October Revolution in the Soviet Union. When our delegation visited the Ryazan locomotive depot, Comrade Qiujiguofu, the director of the Ryazan locomotive depot, introduced Brazhnov's model deeds at the welcoming meeting. At that time, Comrade Brazhnov was the locomotive driver chief of this depot, a representative of the Supreme Soviet, and a winner of the Stalin Prize. When he learned that I was a railway worker and also a locomotive driver, he stood up very happily and shook my hands tightly with a smile on his face. From that day on, we became the closest comrades and friends, and have maintained frequent contact ever since.
　　Brazhnov was a labor hero in the Ryazan locomotive depot at that time. He pulled more than 200 tons of cargo each time in addition to the bureau's prescribed train traction quota of more than 2,100 tons, and often maintained excellent performance of more than 500 kilometers per day for the locomotive. When he learned from our conversation that China's railways did not yet have super-axle traction, he carefully told me about their experience of locomotive super-axle traction of 500 kilometers. He said, "The most important way for locomotive crews to increase production is to use super-axle traction." He said to me very sincerely and modestly, "I will tell you everything so that you can go back and explain it to the Chinese locomotive crew comrades, so that everyone can run 500 kilometers with super-axle traction and accumulate more wealth for the country." His high degree of internationalism deeply moved me. I carefully recorded their advanced experience.
　　Comrade Brazhnov also told me how to organize and carry out the super-axle movement. He said, "Super-axle traction is not only the responsibility of the locomotive department, nor is it only the responsibility of that one contracted crew. All relevant departments of the railway have a responsibility; only when everyone is mobilized can super-axle traction be done well." According to his advanced experience and methods, when I proposed the super-axle traction initiative in our locomotive crew in 1950, I first consulted with the leadership and solicited opinions from relevant departments and workers, and publicized the great significance of super-axle traction for national construction and the then-current Resist America, Aid Korea campaign. Everyone actively supported our locomotive crew's initiative. So, on November 17, 1950, I and stoker Wang Qingquan and Zhang Yuhai first pulled a super-axle train of 2,377 tons between Tianjin and Fengtai. Then, under the leadership of the Party, a mass upsurge of super-axle traction was launched throughout the railway.
　　Although I have been away from the production post and working in the railway trade union for several years now, I will never forget the help that Comrade Brazhnov gave me. When Comrade Brazhnov learned that I had become the initiator of the super-axle movement in China's railways according to their working methods, he was extremely happy. In 1952, he wrote an article in the "People's Railway News," introducing the new working methods they created on the Moscow-Ryazan railway line. When Brazhnov visited China in May 1954 with the Soviet trade union delegation, China's railways were universally launching the full-load, super-axle, 500-kilometer movement. I accompanied him to visit the Fengtai locomotive depot and some other places. When I passed through Moscow on my way back from France in January 1956, I met him at his home for the third time, and our friendship deepened even more.
　　From my deep friendship with Comrade Brazhnov, I deeply realized that the Soviet people will always be our best friends, and the advanced experience of the Soviet Union will always be the direction for us to learn from. Although the bourgeois rightists are doing everything possible to slander and smear the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people, in the face of the facts, it is self-defeating.
　　Recently, I am also very happy to know that Comrade Brazhnov has mastered the latest technology of driving electric locomotives. As the 40th anniversary of the Great October Revolution is approaching, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to my dearest Comrade Brazhnov, and to all the Soviet worker brothers and the Soviet people.

### 苏联先进经验是我们的方向

　　苏联先进经验是我们的方向
　　全国工业劳动模范　李永
    我是一个铁路工人。当伟大的十月革命四十周年到来的时候，我要谈谈苏联政府和苏联铁路工人兄弟对我国铁路运输和建设事业的重大帮助。过去，中长铁路在苏联同志的帮助下，成为我国的模范铁路；现在，武汉长江大桥又在苏联同志的帮助下，胜利地提前建成，并且还创造了管柱钻孔法这种世界建桥史上新的经验。在我们铁路运输和建设上的许多重大成就里面，和全国所有的重大建设成就一样，都有苏联政府和苏联人民的一分功劳。
    在这个伟大节日的前夕，我也不能不怀念着我的最好的朋友、苏联模范机车司机布拉日诺夫同志。
    1949年10月，我代表全国铁路工人到苏联去参加十月革命三十二周年纪念。当我们代表团到梁赞机务段去参观的时候，梁赞机务段长究吉果夫同志在欢迎我们的会上，介绍了布拉日诺夫的模范事迹。那时，布拉日诺夫同志是这个段的机车司机长，是最高苏维埃代表和斯大林奖金获得者。当他知道我是铁路工人，而且也是机车司机的时候，他非常高兴地站起身来，满脸笑容地紧紧握住了我的两只手。从这天起，我俩就变成了最亲密的同志和朋友，并且一直到现在还保持着经常的联系。
    布拉日诺夫那时候是梁赞机务段的一位劳动英雄。他在局定的列车牵引定数二千一百多吨以外，每次都拉二百多吨货物，并且经常保持了机车日车五百公里以上的优秀成绩。当他从我们的交谈中知道我国铁路还没有超轴牵引的时候，他就把他们机车超轴五百公里的经验仔细地告诉给我。他说：“机车乘务员增产最主要的方法就是超轴牵引。”他非常诚恳谦虚地对我说：“我全都告诉你，你回去向中国的机车乘务员同志讲解，好让大伙都超轴跑五百公里，给国家积累更多的财富。”他的这种高度的国际主义精神深深地感动了我。我用心地记下了他们的先进经验。
    布拉日诺夫同志还告诉我怎样组织开展超轴运动的办法。他说：“超轴不单单是机务部门的事，也不只是那一个包乘组的事，铁路各有关部门都有责任；只有大家都动起来，超轴才能搞得好。”根据他的先进经验和办法，我在1950年在我们机车包乘组提出超轴牵引倡议的时候，便事先和领导商量，征求了各有关部门和工人同志们的意见，向他们宣传超轴对国家建设和当时抗美援朝的重大意义。大家都积极支持我们机车包乘组的倡议。于是，1950年11月17日，我就和司炉王清权、张玉海在天津丰台间第一次牵引了二千三百七十七吨超轴列车。接着，在党的领导下，掀起了全路超轴牵引的群众性热潮。
    虽然我现在已经脱离生产岗位到铁路工会工作好几年了，可是布拉日诺夫同志对我的这些帮助，是永远忘记不了的。当布拉日诺夫同志知道了我按照他们的工作方法成了我国铁路超轴运动的发起者的时候，他高兴极了。1952年，他又在给“人民铁道报”写的文章里，介绍了他们在莫斯科到梁赞的铁路线上创造的新的工作方法。当1954年5月布拉日诺夫随着苏联工会代表团到我国访问的时候，我国铁路正在普遍展开满载、超轴、五百公里运动。我陪着他参观了丰台机务段和别的一些地方。1956年1月我从法国回来路经莫斯科时，又和他在他家里第三次见了面，我们的友谊更加深了。
    从和布拉日诺夫同志的深厚友谊里，我深深的体会到：苏联人民永远是我们最好的朋友，苏联的先进经验，永远是我们学习的方向。尽管资产阶级右派分子想尽一切办法，诬蔑和中伤中苏人民的友谊，然而在事实的面前，是不攻自破的。
    最近，我又很高兴地知道布拉日诺夫同志已经掌握了驾驶电气机车的最新技术。当此伟大十月革命四十周年快要到来的时候，我谨向我最亲爱的布拉日诺夫同志致以衷心的祝贺，并向苏联的全体工人兄弟和苏联人民致以衷心的祝贺。
