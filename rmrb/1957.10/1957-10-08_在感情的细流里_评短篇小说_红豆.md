    In the Subtle Currents of Emotion
    —A Review of the Short Story "Red Beads"
    Yi Mo
    Zong Pu's short story "Red Beads," published in the July issue of "People's Literature," does not have a complex plot, but the thoughts and feelings expressed throughout the work are somewhat intricate.

    From a thematic perspective, it is a recollection by the female protagonist, Jiang Mei, of a past love affair. Intertwined within are the contradictions between love and revolution. Ultimately, Jiang Mei repels the attack of private feelings, embarks on the revolutionary path, and becomes a "good Party worker." Eight years later, she returns to work at her alma mater, residing in the same room she once occupied. The "red beads," the tokens of love behind the crucifix, are "still there," rekindling memories of that past love.

    After reading "Red Beads," the development of the story's content and characters evokes at least two contradictory and vague feelings: it seems the author intended to reflect Jiang Mei's growth in the crucible of the revolution. In the middle section of the novel, this intention is somewhat reflected in the artistic imagery. Jiang Mei, a female college student deeply influenced by bourgeois education, was initially indifferent to politics, ignorant of worldly affairs, and indulged only in the so-called "poetic life" of the petty bourgeoisie. Later, due to the terrifying rule of the Chiang Kai-shek regime and the intense stimulation of reality, as well as the influence of Xiao Su, a female classmate who pursued revolution, she gradually developed a longing for democracy and freedom in her thoughts and participated in the revolutionary democratic movement. This created a rift in political ideology between her and her lover, Qi Hong, who hated the revolution and opposed the democratic movement. All of this has a certain degree of truth and typicality in the pre-liberation student democratic movement. Unfortunately, this authentic portrayal of Jiang Mei's character development does not occupy a major position in the novel's plot and is not further developed. The significant artistic and objective effect is to highlight Jiang Mei's painful memories of this outdated love affair. The intense emotions of the lonely Jiang Mei still cling to the past, and her participation in the revolution seems merely an embellishment, a decoration. I do not doubt that the author may have intellectually intended to focus on portraying Jiang Mei as a revolutionary, but because Jiang Mei is not entirely the character of a revolutionary, the plot and character development completely transformed into something else. However, the problem lies in this: the subtle current of the author's emotions revealed in the work also sympathizes with and admires Jiang Mei's inglorious love and uses a somewhat sentimental tone to depict it, completely submerging Jiang Mei in the sea of this inglorious love. In the author's portrayal, even today, as a "good Party worker," Jiang Mei seems unable to escape from this sea of love's suffering! One cannot help but ask, what kind of thoughts and feelings are particularly prominent in this novel's "painful memories of an outdated love affair"? To put it simply, this Jiang Mei, who has "truly become a good Party worker," recalls her love with some self-sacrificing inner pain and cherishes the memory of her Qi Hong. "Ten years of time" have left "what kind of traces" in Jiang Mei's heart! Those past years of "endlessly talking about Beethoven and Chopin, about Su Dongpo and Li Shangyin, about Keats and Browning," that "Jiang Chengzi" of Su Dongpo, which evoked a shared "poetic sadness"—"Ten years of life and death are vast and uncertain! I don't think about it, yet it's hard to forget. A thousand miles to a lonely grave, where can I speak of sorrow?" All of this is so full of romantic meaning! However, can it be said to be healthy when it remains in a "good Party worker"? And in the intense artistic atmosphere colored and depicted by the author, it seems that Jiang Mei "sacrificed" her "eternal love" for the revolution, and the irreplaceable Qi Hong!

    What kind of person is Qi Hong, who is so painfully missed by Jiang Mei? The author and Jiang Mei cannot deny that Qi Hong is a crazy bourgeois individualist whose "soul" is "selfish, brutal, and savage"; he hates the revolution, hates progress; he imagines possessing Jiang Mei in the same way he would possess property, and ultimately becomes a traitor to the motherland, a counter-revolutionary fugitive. When he tries to take Jiang Mei away but fails, he even wants to kill Jiang Mei and "take her away in a coffin"!

    Of course, Jiang Mei did not go with Qi Hong (however, she did not break up with Qi Hong, but hoped he would stay). She participated in the revolution and became a "good Party worker." However, all of this is such a heavy emotional burden! Although Jiang Mei "endured" this final "minute" when they parted, Qi Hong took away Jiang Mei's heart, took away Jiang Mei's love, making Jiang Mei, who lives in the new society, emotionally sink into the old world like a suffering "angel." Throughout the entire artistic portrayal of the work, I cannot see that the author has made any criticism of this emotion, and even Jiang Mei ten years later is written as "holding" the "red beads" that have been "wet with tears" while remembering Qi Hong! This makes it impossible to distinguish any difference between the author's feelings and Jiang Mei's feelings.

    What is there to painfully miss about such an extremely anti-revolutionary traitor to the motherland—Qi Hong—by Jiang Mei, a "good Party worker"? And what is "beautiful" about such an inglorious love, such a Jiang Mei, a "Party worker" who has fallen emotionally to the point of losing her position, that is worth the author's rendering and promotion? What are we being guided to love and hate? What is the author's purpose in writing this work?

    After rereading "Red Beads," I hurriedly closed the wide and thick July issue of "People's Literature," feeling a deep sense of disgust. I no longer want to pin any label on the author because I really haven't been able to distinguish which class's blood is flowing in the subtle currents of emotion expressed in this novel!

    在感情的细流里
    ——评短篇小说“红豆”
    伊默
    “人民文学”7月号发表的宗璞的小说“红豆”，故事情节并不复杂，而整个作品表现出来的思想感情却有些复杂。
    从题材来看，这是小说女主人公江玫对于过去的一次恋情的回忆。里面交织着爱情和革命的矛盾，最后是江玫打退了私情的袭击，走上了革命的道路，并且成了“好的党的工作者”。八年以后，她又回到了母校来工作，又恰恰住在原来住过的房间里。而那十字架后的爱情信物“红豆”依然“还在”，于是，重新勾起了对过去这段爱情的回忆。
    读完了“红豆”以后，故事内容和人物性格的发展，至少给我两种相互矛盾的模糊感觉：似乎作者的意图在反映江玫在革命熔炉里的成长。在小说的中间一部分，这种意图在艺术形象上也得到了一定程度的体现，像江玫这样一个受了浓厚的资产阶级教育影响的女大学生，过去是不问政治，不懂世事，只知沉醉在小资产阶级所谓的“诗意的生活里”。后来由于蒋介石政权的恐怖统治，强烈的现实刺激，又受到了追求革命的女同学萧素的影响，逐渐从思想上产生了对于民主自由的向往，参加到革命的民主运动中去，并因此和她的仇视革命、反对民主运动的爱人齐虹，在政治思想上有了裂痕。这一切，在解放前学生的民主运动中，都是有一定的真实性和典型性的。可惜的是，江玫的这种性格发展的真实描写，在小说情节中，并没有占据主要地位，也没有得到进一步发展；显著的艺术的客观效果，却是突出了江玫的这一段陈旧恋情的痛苦回忆，孤独的江玫的浓重感情仍然留恋着过去，她的参加革命，倒仿佛只是一种陪衬，一种装饰。我并不怀疑，在作者的理智上，可能是企图着重描写革命者的江玫的，但是，因为江玫并不完全是一个革命者的性格，所以故事情节和性格发展，就完全变成了另一种样子。不过，问题在于：作品中流露出来的作者的感情的细流，也是同情和赞赏江玫的并不光彩的爱情，并且用他的多少带有感伤基调的描绘，把江玫完全淹没在这不光彩的爱情的海里。在作者笔下的江玫，甚至在她成为“好的党的工作者”的今天，似乎还没有从这爱情的苦海里摆脱出来！人们不禁要问，这篇小说中特别突出的“陈旧恋情的痛苦回忆”，究竟是什么样的一种思想感情呢？简单地说一句，这位“真的成为一个好的党的工作者”的江玫，是带着有些自我牺牲的内心痛苦在回忆她的爱情，怀念她的齐虹。“十年的时间”，在江玫的心灵里，留下了“怎样的痕迹”啊！那“无止境地谈着贝多芬和萧邦，谈着苏东坡和李商隐，谈着济慈和勃朗宁”的往日的岁月，那唤起了共同的“诗意悲伤”的苏东坡的“江城子”——“十年生死两茫茫！不思量，自难忘。千里孤坟，无处话凄凉”。这一切，多么富有浪漫蒂克的意味！然而，它们留存在一个“好的党的工作者”身上，难道能说是健康的吗？而在作者所着色描写的浓重的艺术氛围里，仿佛江玫为了革命“牺牲”了她的“永恒不变的爱情”，和不可复得的齐虹！
    这位受到江玫这样痛苦怀恋的齐虹，究竟是什么样的人物呢？作者和江玫都不能不承认，齐虹是一个疯狂的资产阶级个人主义者，他的“灵魂深处”是“自私、残暴和野蛮”；他仇视革命，仇视进步；想像占有财产一样地占有江玫，最后是做了祖国的叛徒，反革命的逃亡者。当他想抢走江玫而不能如愿的时候，甚至想杀了江玫，“装在棺材里带走”！
    当然，江玫并没有跟齐虹走，（不过，她也并没有和齐虹决裂，而是希望他留下）她参加了革命，做了“好的党的工作者”。但是，这一切在感情上是多么沉重的负担啊！江玫虽然在他们分别的时候，“撑过了”这最后的“一分钟”，而齐虹却带走了江玫的心，带走了江玫的爱情，使生活在新社会里的江玫，在感情上却像受难的“天使”一样沉落在旧世界里。在作品的整个的艺术描写里，我看不出作者对于这种感情有过任何批判，而且十年后的江玫还被写成是“手握着”被“泪水滴湿”了的“红豆”在怀念齐虹！这使人无法区别作者和江玫的感情有什么不同。
    这样一个极端仇视革命的祖国叛徒——齐虹，有什么值得“好的党的工作者”的江玫这样痛苦地怀念？而这样一段并不光彩的爱情，这样一个在感情上堕落到失掉立场的“党的工作者”的江玫，又有什么“美”的地方值得作者这样渲染和宣扬？作者在引导我们爱什么，恨什么？作者写这篇作品的目的又是什么？
    我重读了“红豆”以后，急忙地阖上了这宽宽的厚厚的7月号“人民文学”，感到一种深深的厌恶，我不再想给作者扣上一顶什么帽子，因为我实在还并没有分辨清楚，在这篇小说所表现出来的感情的细流里，究竟流着哪一阶级的血液！
