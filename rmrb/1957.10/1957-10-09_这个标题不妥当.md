    This Title is Inappropriate
    The title on page three of your newspaper on October 4th, "Lower-Level Cadres in Wuhan Who Share Weal and Woe with the Masses Are Praised," after reading the content, according to my personal analysis, is contradictory to the title of sharing weal and woe with the masses. It also gives me the feeling that cadres participating in physical labor is suffering. What's even more serious is "sharing the woe." If we were in the old society, where the broad masses of working people labored for the exploiting classes, not eating enough and not dressing warmly, we could say we shared the woe. But today's social system is different from the old society's system, and these comrades who are being sent to lower levels are responding to the Party's call to participate in physical labor.

    这个标题不妥当
    你报10月4日三版上一个标题“和群众同甘苦共患难武汉下放干部受到赞扬”，可是将内容看完后，根据我个人的分析是和群众同甘苦共患难的标题相矛盾的。同时也给我这样一个感觉：好像干部下放参加体力劳动是受苦。还有更严重的是“共患难”，我们如果在旧社会里广大劳动人民给剥削阶级劳动，吃不饱，穿不暖，可以说共患难。可是今天的社会制度和过去旧社会的制度不同，而我们这些下放的同志是响应了党的号召参加体力劳动的。
