　　Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 16th: The strength struggle of 840,000 public corporation workers in Japan has been gradually launched since yesterday. The autumn struggle launched by workers across Japan to defend basic rights and strive for improved living conditions has entered a climax.
    Because they have been deprived of the right to strike by reactionary laws, public corporation workers have launched various forms of "legal struggles." Today, 150,000 telecommunications workers began an indefinite refusal to work overtime. Today, 39,000 monopoly industry workers in 54 locations across the country began a struggle to refuse overtime and refuse to work on holidays, and held employee meetings during working hours. The struggle of monopoly industry workers will continue for four days.
    Yesterday, 50,000 workers from the National Railway Locomotive Union launched "legal struggles" in 27 locations across the country, and their struggle will continue until the 17th.
    350,000 national railway workers, more than 200,000 postal workers, and workers in printing, papermaking, and other enterprises will also launch struggles within a day or two.
    Japanese steel workers and shipbuilding workers, who have already held the first strike, are preparing to launch a second strike. The irregular strike of Japanese coal miners is still ongoing.

    新华社16日讯  东京消息：日本八十四万公共企业工人的实力斗争已经从昨天陆续开始。日本全国工人展开的保卫基本权利和争取改善工人生活的秋季斗争进入了高潮。
    由于被反动法律剥夺了罢工权利，公共企业工人展开了各种方式的“守法斗争”。十五万电信工人今天开始无限期地拒绝加班。三万九千名专卖业的工人今天在全国五十四处地方开始展开拒绝加班、拒绝在假日上班的斗争，并且在工作时间里举行了职工大会。专卖业工人的斗争将继续四天。
    昨天，国营铁道机车工会的五万名工人在全国二十七个地方展开了“守法斗争”，他们的斗争将继续到17日。
    三十五万国营铁道工人、二十多万邮政工人和印刷、造纸等企业的工人也将在一两天内展开斗争。
    已经举行了第一次罢工的日本钢铁工人和造船工人，正在准备展开第二次罢工。日本煤矿工人的不定期罢工仍在坚持中。
