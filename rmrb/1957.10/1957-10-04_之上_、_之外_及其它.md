	"Above", "Outside" and Others
	Tang Tao
	In his latest confession, Feng Xuefeng summarized his relationship with the Party over the past thirty years as: "When successful, he placed himself above the Party; when frustrated, he placed himself outside the Party." Indeed, this relationship is shocking. It turns out that, as a nominal Party member, he was sometimes "above" and sometimes "outside," but never "below" or "within" the Party. As a Party member, his content and form were not unified. This lack of unity inevitably led to a position of opposition to the Party. Judging from this historical thread, it is not difficult to understand how a veteran Party member with thirty years of experience could have degenerated into an anti-Party element.
	Because his thought never fundamentally joined the Party.
	Such a person always harbors ulterior motives towards the Party. When the Party trusts him and entrusts him with important tasks, he does not consider the issue from the perspective of the collective interest or treat this trust seriously; instead, he sees it as a personal opportunity, becoming complacent and rising to a position "above" the Party, where he condescendingly commands, distorts, and even splits the Party. At this point, he appears with the attitude of "I am the Party" or "I am more brilliant than the Party," even though he is only an insignificant individual. This "individual" has already risen above the Party, and the more he does so, the more "successful" he feels – of course, this is only his personal "success."
	But when the Party criticizes him and raises serious objections to his reckless behavior, he does not consider his mistakes from a principled standpoint; instead, he sees it as a personal blow and becomes "frustrated." He retreats "outside" the organization, becoming a detached "critic": This won't work! That won't work either! He even feels that "humanity has no hope." Due to his personal "frustration," the flames of revolution have long been extinguished in these people. Didn't Feng Xuefeng himself admit to wanting to "take the path of a writer alone"? Such a path is impossible to follow. Therefore, since liberation, he has remained outwardly silent but grumbled behind the scenes, calling all those who stand at their revolutionary posts to serve the people "officials," in order to highlight his "outsider" status. The more vibrant the revolutionary cause becomes, the darker his mood becomes, filled with depression and nihilistic thoughts. He clearly feels that the great victory of collectivism is heavily suppressing his personal ambition. Since he has placed himself "outside" the Party, he feels even more "frustrated" – of course, this is still a personal "frustration" based on self-centeredness.
	"Success" is personal "success"; "frustration" is also personal "frustration." Whether "above" or "outside," for a Party member, it has indeed reached a point of irreconcilable opposition to the Party. This is because "above" is because he feels he is superior to the Party, and "outside" is because he feels he is greater than the Party. Even if he is accommodated a little more, and the entire Party serves him, he will still feel it is too low and too small, and it will be difficult to satisfy him. His final result will inevitably be anti-Party.
	This is the tragic path taken by Feng Xuefeng and others like him.
	The gate of socialism is very wide and spacious, but all inflated individualism still cannot pass through. This is not because it is really too high and too big, but because individualism is too thin and cannot be touched. Either it breaks with a touch, or it bounces back. It is not only "above" and "outside" (the "zhi" character should be understood as a verb - author), but also like a wandering soul, drifting aimlessly, not knowing where it "is going".
	Where to go and what to do is now the time for all individualists to choose, not just the anti-Party element Feng Xuefeng. September 21

    “之上”、“之外”及其它
    唐韬
    冯雪峰在最近一次交代里，谈到三十年来他对党的关系，概括起来是：“得意时把自己放在党之上，失意时把自己放在党之外。”的确，这种关系是令人吃惊的，原来他名为党员，一忽儿“之上”，一忽儿“之外”，却从来没有把自己放在党“之下”、“之内”。作为一个党员，他的内容和形式是并不统一的，不统一，必然就要发展到和党对立的地步。根据这条历史线索看来，所谓拥有三十年党龄的老党员，居然堕落成为反党分子，那就不是什么难以理解的问题了。
    因为他的思想根本上就没有入过党。
    这样的人，对党是始终怀有二心的。当党信任他、委他以重任的时候，他并不是从集体的利益上考虑问题，严肃地来对待这个信任；却把它看作是个人的际遇，“春风得意”，飘飘然一直升到党“之上”，居高临下的来指挥党，篡改党，甚而至于分裂党。这时候，他是完全以“我就是党”、“我比党更高明”的姿态出现的，尽管他只是一个微不足道的个人，这个“个人”却已经凌驾乎党“之上”，并且愈是这样，他就愈“得意”——当然这只是他个人的“得意”。
    而一到党批评他、对他这种胡作非为提出严正的意见时，他也不是从原则上来考虑自己的错误，却把这个看成是对个人的打击，于是乎：“失意”了。他就退到组织“之外”，成为一个超然物外的“批评家”：这不行！那也不行！甚至觉得“人类没有希望”。由于个人的所谓“失意”，革命的火焰早已在这些人身上熄灭了。冯雪峰不是自己承认：想“走单单一个作家的路”吗？这样的路是走不通的，所以解放以来，他表面沉默，背后牢骚，把所有站在革命岗位上为人民服务的人，都叫做“当官的”，以自显其“之外”的身分；革命事业越是生气蓬勃，他的心境越是阴暗，消沉，虚无主义思想越是抬头。他分明的感到：集体主义的伟大胜利，极其沉重地压抑着他的个人野心，自己既然自“外”于党，因而更加觉得“失意”——当然，这依旧是从自我中心出发的个人的“失意”。
    “得意”，是个人的“得意”；“失意”，也是个人的“失意”，无论“之上”“之外”，对于一个党员来说，的确已经到了和党势不两立的地步。这是由于，“上”，是因为他觉得自己高于党，“外”，是因为他觉得自己大于党，即使再迁就他一点，使全党为他服务，他也会觉得太低太小，很难满足了。他的最后的结果必然是反党。
    这就是冯雪峰以及像冯雪峰一样的人所走的悲剧的道路。
    社会主义的关口是很阔大、很宽裕的，然而一切吹胖了的个人主义却还是通不过去，这倒不是因为他真的太高太大，而是因为个人主义太单薄，碰不得。或者是一碰即破，或者是一碰即弹回去。不仅“之上”“之外”（这个“之”字应作动词解——作者），而是像游魂一样，飘飘然不知其所“之”了。
    何去何从，现在正是所有个人主义者应该选择的时候，不仅反党分子冯雪峰而已。  9月21日
