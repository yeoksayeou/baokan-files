Xinhua News Agency, 16th - In the past five years, an average of one weather station has been built in China every 32 and a half hours. Before liberation, in the 75 years since the first modern observatory appeared in China in 1873, only 72 weather stations were built, averaging less than one per year.

Before liberation, weather stations were scattered sparsely in a few coastal provinces and some large cities and railway trunk lines inland. Now, there are 1,660 weather stations and climatological stations (excluding those of the military departments) nationwide. A weather station network has basically formed on Chinese soil. Even in sparsely populated areas such as the Kangzang Plateau, the Pamir Plateau, and the Great Gobi Desert, weather stations have been established; the density of ground weather stations has basically reached the international level.

With the rapid increase in weather stations, the operational content and service work of meteorological work have also greatly developed. Before liberation, meteorological work mainly involved some general ground meteorological observations and the issuance of weather forecasts for two or three large cities and a few customs offices and airports. Now, meteorological service objects cover national defense, industry, transportation, agriculture, animal husbandry, fisheries, salt industry, forestry, water conservancy, grain storage and transportation, and the people's clothing, food, housing, and transportation, etc., with service volume exceeding that before liberation by hundreds of times. The quality of meteorological work is also improving year by year. At present, the average accuracy rate of disastrous weather forecasts from weather stations across the country has reached more than 80%, and the average accuracy rate of general short-term weather forecasts has reached more than 75%, both of which are close to international levels. On the basis of improved quality, the time limit of weather forecasts has also been extended. The original short-term weather forecasts of only 12 hours have now developed into 24-hour, 36-hour, and 48-hour weather forecasts, medium-term weather forecasts of three to five days, and even climate outlooks of one to two months.

In recent years, thanks to the timely release of weather forecasts and the continuous improvement of accuracy, the safety of aviation and navigation in our country has been basically guaranteed. Since liberation, China's civil aviation passenger planes have not had any accidents involving plane crashes or casualties due to meteorological factors. The losses caused by disasters such as typhoons, cold waves, frosts, and rainstorms to national production and construction and the lives and property of the people have also been greatly reduced. Like the powerful typhoon in 1956, which was rare in decades and penetrated deep inland into several provinces, and the once-in-a-century Yangtze River flood in 1954, the meteorological department's timely release of accurate forecasts and warnings enabled relevant leading authorities to organize the people in advance to make various preparations and arrangements for typhoon and flood prevention, thereby preventing and reducing many losses. Due to the adoption of preventive measures based on weather forecasts, livestock losses caused by sudden blizzards on the Inner Mongolia grasslands had been reduced by more than 60% three years ago compared with before liberation, and many agricultural areas have greatly reduced or eliminated the harm of frost to crops. In 1956, the Liaodong Peninsula relied on weather forecasts to break the past habit of no salt production during the rainy season in August, increasing salt production for the country by more than 10 million yuan. In recent years, the meteorological department has accumulated a wealth of data and provided important bases for the planning and design work of many national production and construction projects, especially the 156 major projects.

### 气象台站遍布全国

　　气象台站遍布全国
    据新华社16日讯　五年来我国平均每三十二小时半就兴建一个气象台、站。而在解放前，从1873年中国出现第一个近代化观象台起的七十五年间只建了七十二个气象台、站，平均每年还不到一个。
    解放前的气象台、站，只是零零星星地散布在沿海几省和内地的几个大城市、铁路干线上。现在全国已经有一千六百六十个气象台、气象站和气候站（不包括军事部门的）：气象台站网已经在中国土地上基本形成了。连康藏高原、帕米尔高原和大戈壁等许多人烟稀少的地方，都建立了气象台、站；地面气象站的密度，已经基本上达到国际水平。
    随着气象台站的迅速增加，气象工作的业务内容和服务工作也有了巨大发展。解放前气象工作主要是进行一些一般的地面气象观测，对两三个大城市和几个海关、飞机场发布一些天气预报，现在，气象服务对象遍及国防、工业、交通运输、农业、牧业、渔业、盐业、林业、水利、粮食储运和广大人民的衣食住行等方面，服务量超过解放前几百倍。气象工作的质量也在逐年提高。目前，全国气象台的灾害性天气预报的准确率平均达80％以上，一般短期天气预报的准确率平均达75％以上，都已经接近国际水平。在质量提高的基础上，天气预报的时限也延长了，原来只有十二小时的短期天气预报，现在已经发展到二十四小时、三十六小时和四十八小时的天气预报，三天到五天的中期天气预报，以至一个月到两个月的气候展望。
    几年来，由于天气预报的及时发布和准确率不断提高，我国的航空和航海安全已经基本上有了保证。我国民航客机自从解放以来没有因气象因素造成机毁或人员伤亡的事故；台风、寒潮、霜冻、暴风雨等灾害给国家生产建设和广大人民生命财产所造成的损失，也已经大大减轻。像1956年那样几十年少见的一次深入内陆数省的强大台风，1954年那样百年罕有的长江洪水，由于气象部门及时发布了准确的预报、警报，使有关领导机关能够事先组织人民作好防台、防洪的各项准备和部署，从而防止和减少了许多损失。由于根据天气预报采取了预防措施，内蒙古草原上因突来的大风雪所造成的牲畜损失在三年前就已比解放前减少60％以上，不少农作地区大大地减轻或消除了霜冻对农作物的危害。辽东半岛1956年依靠天气预报，打破了历年8月雨季不产盐的习惯，为国家增产了价值一千多万元的盐。几年来，气象部门积累了丰富的资料，并为国家的许多生产建设、特别是一百五十六项巨大工程建设的规划设计工作，提供了重要的依据。
