　　"Underground Great Wall"
    The five-act play "Underground Great Wall," which is currently being performed in Beijing by the Drama Troupe of the General Political Department of the People's Liberation Army, depicts the heroic deeds of a company stationed in the tunnels of the main peak of Shangganling. The playwright has portrayed several heroic characters with different personalities in considerable depth, praising their tenacious fighting will, their belief in the inevitable victory of the revolution, as well as their optimism and lofty internationalist spirit. In terms of performance, whether it is the directing technique, the actor's creation, or the stage atmosphere, it has a strong flavor of military life.
    This troupe took this play on a four-month tour to visit and perform for troops stationed in various locations this year, giving a total of ninety-seven performances to an audience of over 180,000 people. After its public performance in Beijing, this play will also be given as a special performance for the troops stationed in the area.  (Lie Bing)

　　“地下长城”
    解放军总政文工团话剧团正在北京上演的五幕话剧“地下长城”，描写了坚守上甘岭主峰坑道中一个连队的英雄事迹。剧作者在较深的程度上刻划了几个不同性格的英雄人物形象，歌颂了他们顽强的战斗意志、对革命必胜的信念，以及乐观主义和崇高的国际主义精神。在演出上，不论是导演手法、演员创造、舞台气氛等方面都有着浓厚的部队生活特色。
    该团带了这个戏在今年曾向各地驻军作了为期四个月的慰问演出，共演出了九十七场、观众十八万余人。这个戏在京公演后，还将为驻军部队作招待演出。  （列兵）
