　　The First Man-Made "Small Moon"
　　Chen Zungui, Director of the Beijing Planetarium
    The successful launch of an artificial Earth satellite by the Soviet Union has inaugurated a new era in human science. I would like to share some knowledge about artificial Earth satellites with boundless excitement.
    What is an Artificial Earth Satellite?
    In astronomy, a star orbiting a planet is called a satellite. There are currently thirty-one known satellites. That is, Earth has one, Mars has two, Jupiter has twelve, Saturn has nine, Uranus has five, and Neptune has two. Earth's satellite is the Moon. The satellite launched by the Soviet Union this time orbits the Earth, so it is called an artificial Earth satellite, which is actually an artificially made moon.
    Conditions for Sending Objects into High Altitude
    Chinese folklore includes the story of Chang'e flying to the moon. The flying apsaras in the Dunhuang murals of Gansu, and the description of Sun Wukong jumping to fly 108,000 miles, are all ancient people's fantasies about flying out of the Earth. Who knew that these fantasies, under the creation of human wisdom, would gradually become reality.
    In ancient times, people had actually sent some small objects to not very high skies. For example, the sky lantern or Kongming lantern utilizes the heat generated during the burning of objects to rise upward, pushing the oil paper or oil cloth into a top screen. Kites utilize wind power, that is, the force of airflow and human control, to make it subject to an upward component force and float in the sky. As for airplanes, they were invented by the Russian scientist Tsiolkovsky in 1882. Airplanes are manufactured successfully by utilizing principles such as propeller propulsion; although they can fly very high, they are limited to about ten kilometers in altitude. Balloons utilize the principle of specific gravity; filling a rubber or metal ball with a gas lighter than air can make the balloon rise. In meteorology and scientific research, these balloons have achieved considerable success, reaching altitudes of over thirty kilometers.
    The objects mentioned above that are sent into high altitude are not only limited in height, but also eventually fall down. Why do all objects always fall down? Everyone knows that this is because objects are subject to the Earth's gravitational force. Therefore, if we want to send an object into high altitude, we should give the object a kinetic energy, that is, give it a force to make its speed vertically upward. In this way, it can break out of the Earth's gravitational range and reach a space unaffected by the Earth's gravity.
    According to calculations, as long as an object's speed reaches 11.2 kilometers per second, this object will vertically leave the Earth and rise into the sky. This speed is called the escape velocity. This is the speed assuming that there is no atmospheric resistance, but in reality, the atmosphere does have resistance. Therefore, for an object to escape the Earth and rise into space, the actual speed must be greater than the theoretical escape velocity. This actual escape velocity is approximately 26 kilometers per second.
    Escape velocity is the speed required for space travel, but artificial satellites do not need to escape the Earth. They only need to rise to a considerable height above the ground. At this time, the force required to increase the object is much smaller than the energy required to escape the Earth. However, only using the calculated energy to send the object into high altitude, when it reaches the required height, the speed becomes zero, and the object falls down on its own. Therefore, to make an artificial satellite orbit the Earth without falling, it must have an orbital velocity relative to the Earth. This orbital velocity obviously changes with altitude. According to calculations, at an altitude of 500 kilometers above the ground, the orbital velocity is 7.6 kilometers per second.
    How are Artificial Satellites Sent into the Sky?
    Since we know the speed required for an object to orbit the Earth, then to give the object such a high speed, it is absolutely impossible to launch directly from the Earth. The Russian scientist Tsiolkovsky, whose 100th anniversary was celebrated this year, pointed out in 1903 that rockets should be used to send it out. A rocket is a pointed, cylindrical object that stores a large amount of fuel inside. This fuel burns, and the gas is continuously discharged from the tail, making the rocket move forward continuously, and the speed increases. This is continuously utilizing the principle of reaction. The power of one rocket is not enough, so multi-stage rockets should be used.
    The first artificial satellite launched by the Soviet Union was 58 centimeters in diameter, weighed 83.6 kilograms, reached an altitude of 900 kilometers, and had a speed of 8 kilometers per second. It was launched using a three-stage rocket. The lowest stage of the rocket is launched first, and the rocket begins to rise vertically. A few seconds later, the second stage of the rocket also begins to launch. At this time, the rocket's speed has reached 7,000 to 7,500 kilometers per hour. The first stage of the rocket burns out and automatically detaches in space. From the second stage of the rocket, an inclined direction is taken to continue ascending. When the third stage of the rocket takes effect, the speed reaches 18,000 to 20,000 kilometers per hour. When the third stage of the rocket sends the artificial Earth satellite to a certain altitude, the speed reaches 29,000 kilometers per hour. At this time, the third stage of the rocket automatically detaches from the artificial satellite, causing it to orbit the Earth in an elliptical orbit. The apogee of the elliptical orbit, which is the highest point from the Earth's surface, is 900 kilometers, and the perigee, which is the lowest point from the Earth's surface, is 300 to 500 kilometers. Its speed also changes, and the average speed is 8 kilometers per second.
    Because the altitude of 900 kilometers still has atmospheric ions and meteor matter, forming the resistance to the artificial Earth satellite, the speed of the artificial satellite will gradually slow down, gradually fall down, and finally burn up like a meteor.
    How to Observe Artificial Earth Satellites
    The speed of artificial Earth satellites is very fast, requiring only about one hour and thirty-six minutes to orbit the Earth once, and its orbital direction is also changing at all times. So, how should we find it?
      First of all, we should pay attention to newspaper reports. Because Moscow is in contact with Xinhua News Agency every day by telegram, we can find it according to the reported time and direction. It is best to use binoculars, because its field of view is larger than that of ordinary telescopes, and it can freely look at any part of the sky. As for ordinary telescopes, their effect is similar to that of the naked eye, and their effect is not great. Sometimes the naked eye can also see it. A comrade from the Beijing Planetarium saw a five-magnitude star with a red and yellow band flying past on the night of the 7th. People in Japan, the United States, Finland, and other places have also seen it with the naked eye. But this may also be the rocket that transports the artificial Earth satellite.
    As for organized observations, many wide-angle telescopes are needed, that is, telescopes with a field of view that can see ten to twelve degrees of the sky. Now, let me introduce the observation situation of the Beijing Planetarium on the night of the 7th.
    The Beijing Planetarium itself only has seven small telescopes, and they are arranged on the meridian. Except for the sky within twenty degrees of the horizon near the north and south, each telescope is responsible for twenty degrees of the sky. Later, the meteorological department of the Air Force Headquarters brought twelve wind-measuring theodolites and arranged them on the same meridian. Except for the sky within thirty degrees of the horizon near the north and south, they guarded the north and south sky, each responsible for a ten-degree range. Because according to the Soviet forecast, the artificial Earth satellite flies from southwest to northeast, and it should pass through the Beijing meridian, this distribution will not miss the opportunity.
    We observed from 22:30 to 23:00, and someone reported the time every minute. When 22:49 was reported, the whole field was silent. The Air Force comrades guarding the sky at an elevation of 70 degrees and 80 degrees to the south saw a star shadow slowly moving from southwest to northeast. Since the time and direction were the same as the Soviet forecast, and the light and shadow were stable and not like a meteor, we believe that this may be the artificial Earth satellite; however, it remains to be studied whether it can be seen because it is not dusk or dawn. In addition, in about the same direction, a comrade saw a red-yellow star shadow flying by with the naked eye, which may also be an artificial satellite.
    The Significance of the Successful Launch of Artificial Satellites
    The successful launch of the first artificial satellite by the Soviet Union is an epoch-making event. As Dr. Pokrovsky of the Soviet Union of Technical Sciences said: "We are now on the edge of two eras. The period in which mankind is limited to living on Earth is coming to an end, and the era of mankind entering the universe is beginning. Mankind is changing from a terrestrial organism to a cosmic organism."
    The role of artificial Earth satellites, apart from military aspects which will not be discussed for the time being, has a significant relationship with astronomy, meteorology, physics, and especially geophysics. In the past, we have been making observations on the Earth's surface under a thick atmosphere, which is like looking at things behind a thick curtain. Now we can lift the curtain to see the true phenomena of the universe. For example, we can find out how much total radiation energy the sun has, and we can also measure the total radiation intensity of all fixed stars.
    Through artificial Earth satellites, we can study the intensity and nature of cosmic rays in the high altitude to solve the problem of the origin of cosmic rays; we can study the structure of the entire atmosphere, such as the changes in atmospheric density, pressure, and temperature with altitude; we can study the distribution of geomagnetic intensity in the air, and the state of changes in the Earth's magnetic field during magnetic storms; we can study the geography and meteorology of the North and South Pole regions, which are not easily accessible to humans; we can study the albedo of the ground, assist in geodetic surveys to determine the shape and size of the Earth; we can verify the correctness of the general theory of relativity; and we can do preliminary preparations for space travel.
    More importantly, this will broaden people's horizons, not put their energy into human infighting, but put their wisdom into how to conquer nature; that is, educate more people to oppose war and strive for lasting world peace. (Attached picture)

　　第一个人造“小月亮”
　　北京天文馆馆长  陈遵妫
    苏联发射人造地球卫星的成功，开创了人类科学的新纪元。我谨以无限兴奋的心情，在这里谈谈关于人造地球卫星的一些知识。
    什么叫做人造地球卫星
    在天文学上，把绕着行星走的星叫做卫星。现在已经知道的卫星有三十一个。那就是地球有一个，火星有两个，木星有十二个，土星有九个，天王星有五个，海王星有两个。地球的卫星，就是月亮。这次苏联所发放的卫星是绕着地球走的，所以把它叫做人造地球卫星，实际也就是人工制造的月亮。
    把物体送上高空的条件
    我国民间流传着嫦娥奔月的故事。甘肃敦煌壁画的飞天，孙悟空一跳可以飞出十万八千里的描写，这些都是古代人们对于飞出地球的幻想。那知这种幻想，果然在人类智慧的创造下，渐渐地都变成事实。
    古代人们实际已经把一些小的物体送到不很高的天空去过。比方说，神灯或孔明灯是利用物体燃烧时候所发生的热气向上升，把油纸或油布做成顶幕向上冲出去。风筝是利用风力，也就是气流的力量和人类的控制力，使它受一个上升的分力而在天空中飘游着。至于飞机，是1882年俄罗斯科学家摩南依斯基发明的。飞机是利用螺旋桨推进等原理来制造成功的；它虽然可以飞得很高，但也只限于十公里左右的高空。还有气球，则是利用比重原理，在橡皮球或金属球里面装着比空气轻的气体，就可以使气球上升。在气象学和科学研究中，这种气球获得不少的成就，高度可以达到三十多公里。
    以上所说的被送到高空中去的物体，不独高度很有限，而且终究总要落下来。为什么一切物体总要落下来呢？大家都知道这是物体受到地球引力作用的缘故。因而我们要想把物体送到高空去，那就应该给物体一个动能，就是给它一个力量，使它的速度铅直向上。这样，它就可以冲出地球引力范围以外而达到不受地球引力作用的空间。
    根据计算，只要物体速度达到每秒十一点二公里，则这物体将铅直向上脱离地球而上升到天空，这个速度叫做脱离速度。这是假设大气没有阻力时候的速度，但实际上大气是有阻力的，因而物体要脱离地球升到空间去，真正速度要比理论上的脱离速度大。这个真正的脱离速度约为每秒二十六公里。
    脱离速度是航行宇宙空间所需要的速度，而人造卫星是不需要脱离地球的，它只需要上升到距地面一个相当高度就可以。这时候物体所需要增加的力量，比脱离地球所需要的能量小得多。但只用计算的能量把物体送到高空去，当它达到所需要的高度时候，速度就变为零而物体又自行落下。所以要使人造卫星绕地球转而不掉下，必须使它对于地球有一个环绕速度。这个环绕速度，显然是随着高度而变更的。根据计算，在离地面五百公里的高空，环绕速度是每秒七点六公里。
    人造卫星是怎样被送上天空的
    我们既然知道物体环绕地球转动所需要的速度，那末要给物体以这样快的速度，就绝不能从地球上直接发射。今年诞生一百周年纪念的俄国科学家齐奥尔科夫斯基曾在1903年指出利用火箭送出去。火箭是尖头圆筒形状的东西，里面贮有大量燃料。这些燃料燃烧，把气体从尾部陆续排出去，使火箭不断前进，速度越来越大。这就是连续不断地利用反作用的原理。一个火箭的力量还不够，所以应该用多节的火箭。
    苏联所发放的第一颗人造卫星，直径五十八公分，重八十三点六公斤，高达九百公里，每秒速度是八公里。它是用三节火箭发射的。最下面的一节火箭首先发动，火箭开始垂直上升。几秒钟后第二节火箭也开始发动，这时火箭速度已达每小时七千到七千五百公里。第一节火箭烧完自动脱落于空间。从第二节火箭开始采取倾斜方向继续上升，到第三节火箭起作用的时候，速度达到每小时一万八千到二万公里。第三节火箭把人造地球卫星送到一定高空的时候，速度达每小时二万九千公里，这时第三节火箭自动地脱离人造卫星而使它按椭圆轨道绕着地球转动。椭圆轨道的远地点即离地球表面最高的点是九百公里，近地点即离地球表面最低的点是三百到五百公里。它的速度也有变化，而平均速度是每秒八公里。
    由于九百公里的高空还有大气离子和流星物质，形成了人造地球卫星的阻力，所以人造卫星的速度将逐渐减慢，逐渐往下落，最后像流星一样烧掉。
    怎样观察人造地球卫星
    人造地球卫星的速度非常的快，绕地球一周只需要一小时三十六分钟左右，而且它的轨道方向也时时刻刻在变化着。那末，我们应该怎样寻找呢？
      首先我们应该注意报纸的报道。因为每天莫斯科都有电报和新华社联系，所以我们可以根据报道的时刻和方向去找。最好使用双眼镜，因为它的视野角度比一般望远镜大，并且可以自由地看天空任何部分。至于一般望远镜的作用和肉眼差不多，作用不大。肉眼有时也可以看到，北京天文馆有一位同志在7日夜就看到一个像红带黄色的五等星光飞过去，还有日本、美国、芬兰等地都有人用肉眼看见过。但这也可能是运送人造地球卫星的火箭。
    至于有组织的观测则需要有许多广角望远镜，就是说需要视野可以看十到十二度天空的望远镜。现在把北京天文馆在7日夜晚观测的情况介绍一下。
    北京天文馆自己只有七架小望远镜，把它们排在子午线上，除南北接近地平线二十度的天空不看外，每架各担任二十度的天空。后来空军司令部气象部门带来了十二架测风经纬仪，也把它们排在同一子午线上，除南北接近地平三十度的天空不看外，分别守卫着南北天空，各担任十度范围。因为根据苏联预告，人造地球卫星是从西南向东北飞去，应该会通过北京的子午线，这样分布才不至于错过机会。
    我们从二十二时三十分观察到二十三时整，每隔一分钟有人报告时刻。当报告二十二时四十九分的时候，全场静寂无声，守卫向南仰角七十度和八十度的空军同志，就看到一个星影慢慢地从西南向东北而去。由于时间和方向都和苏联预报的一样，光影稳定而不像流星，所以我们认为这可能就是人造地球卫星；但由于不是黄昏和黎明，是否能够看到还待研究。此外，约在同一方向，有一位同志用肉眼看到一个红色带黄的星影飞过，这也有是人造卫星的可能。
    人造卫星发射成功的意义
    苏联第一颗人造卫星发射成功，是一个划时代的事件。正如苏联技术科学博士波克罗夫斯基所说：“我们现在已经处在两个时代的边缘。现在人类仅限于在地球上生活的时期正在结束，人类进入宇宙时代正在开始。人类正在由地球的生物变成宇宙的生物。”
    人造地球卫星的作用，除有关军事方面姑且不谈外，它对于天文学、气象学、物理学，特别是对地球物理学都有重大的关系。过去我们都在厚厚的一个大气层下面的地球表面上做观测，这就如同在笼罩着一层厚幕后面看东西一样，而现在我们却能够揭开厚幕来看清宇宙的真现象了。比方说，可以搞清楚太阳总辐射能量究竟有多大，也可以测出一切恒星的总辐射强度。
    通过人造地球卫星可以研究高空的宇宙线的强度和它的性质来解决宇宙线的来源问题；可以研究整个大气的构造，例如大气密度、压力和温度随着高度而变化的情况；可以研究地磁强度的空中分布情形，以及发生磁暴时候地球磁场变动的状态；可以研究人类不容易前往的南北极地区的地理和气象等问题；可以研究地面的反照率，协助大地测量来确定地球的形状和大小；可以验证广义相对论的正确性；并且替宇宙航行做好初步的准备工作。
    更重要的是这将使人们扩大眼界，不把精力放在人类自相残杀方面，而把智慧向着怎样去征服自然方面；也就是教育了更众多的人们应该反对战争，而为争取世界永久和平而努力。（附图片）
