　　One Day and Night to Reach the Lunar Palace
    Soviet Union Has Designed a Plan to Fly to the Moon
    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 11th - The Soviet "Labor News" published on the 11th a speech by Soviet Doctor of Physics and Mathematics, Dubronravov, stating that the Soviet Union has already designed a plan to fly to the moon. If a spacecraft's speed exceeds eleven kilometers per second, it would only take a day and night to reach the moon. It will not be long before humans fly to the moon.
    Dubronravov also said that Soviet and foreign scientists are designing plans to fly to Mars. According to calculations, a round trip to Mars would take three years. Currently, scientists are looking for a plan that takes the shortest amount of time.
    Scientists are seriously studying the question of whether human tissues can adapt to space flight, such as digestion, blood circulation, and brain activity in the absence of weight. Most scientists believe that human tissues can still function normally without weight. These issues will be finally resolved after a certain period of time. They also believe that future spacecraft flights should use accelerations that the human body can withstand.

　　一昼夜可到月宫
    苏联已设计了飞往月球计划
    新华社莫斯科11日电  苏联“劳动报”11日登载的苏联物理数学博士杜布朗腊沃夫的一篇谈话说，苏联已经设计了飞行到月球去的方案，如果宇宙飞船的速度超过每秒十一公里，那末只要一昼夜的时间就可以到达月球。人类飞到月球上去，已经不是长久以后的事情了。
    杜布朗腊沃夫还说，苏联和外国的科学家都在设计飞向火星的方案，按照计算，到火星来回一次需要三年。目前，科学家们正在寻找只要花费最短时间的方案。
    科学家们正在认真研究关于人体组织是否适应空际飞行的问题，例如人在失去重量的情况下，消化、血液循环和大脑的活动状态等。其中大多数科学家认为在没有重量的情况下，人体组织仍能正常活动。这些问题经过一定时间后就能得到最后解决。他们还认为将来的宇宙飞船飞行时，应该采用人体能够承受的加速度。
