Xinhua News Agency, 8th. The General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army today issued a notice to the entire army on celebrating the 40th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution.

The notice stated that the entire army should treat the propaganda activities commemorating the 40th anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution as a part of socialist education, focusing on explaining to soldiers the great significance of the October Revolution, the achievements of Soviet construction, the spirit of hard work and thrift in national construction of the Soviet people, the selfless assistance provided by the Soviet Union to our country in various aspects, the important significance of the unity between the Chinese and Soviet people, etc., and use vivid and concrete facts to refute the fallacies of the rightists against the Soviet Union, against communism, and against socialism.

The notice requires that in addition to actively participating in various commemorative activities held in various regions, all units should also hold commemorative meetings, report meetings, or discussion meetings before and after the festival, with unit leaders giving reports at these meetings. From late October, army newspapers and periodicals should systematically introduce the history of the October Revolution and the great achievements of Soviet construction, publish articles written by comrades who have visited, interviewed, or studied in the Soviet Union, and continuously report on the various commemorative activities of the units. Army cultural troupes should perform some programs related to the Soviet Union. Unit clubs can also widely carry out activities using mass methods such as screening movies and slides, listening to the radio, holding photo exhibitions, and publishing wall newspapers.

Xinhua News Agency, 8th. In order to welcome the arrival of the 40th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution, China's film, art, and publishing departments are actively preparing various celebration activities.

The Ministry of Culture has decided to hold the largest "Soviet Film Week" since the liberation of our country, starting on November 7th. During the film week, twenty-seven cities across the country will simultaneously screen Soviet films such as "Prelude to Revolution," "Paul Kochakin," "Whirlwind of Hatred," "Defending the Fortress," "Vocation," and "Animation Collection." Audiences of all nationalities in our country will once again see the struggle life of the Soviet Union during various revolutionary periods, the noble qualities of the Soviet people, and the brilliant achievements of Soviet film art on the screen.

The theater community is currently rehearsing Soviet plays intensively as a gift for the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution. Some of the most famous theater groups are preparing to perform famous Soviet plays such as "The Storm of Revolution," "The Man with a Gun," "Mashenka," "Far Away," and "Severance" in the capital in early November. Music groups are preparing to hold grand concerts during the festival.

Dozens of publications with rich content commemorating the October Revolution are being rushed to print. Some readings will be available to readers in mid-October. Currently, the People's Publishing House is preparing to publish "Lenin on the Great October Socialist Revolution," "The Impact of the October Revolution on the Chinese Revolution," and "Collected Essays Commemorating the October Revolution," among other books on the nature of the October Revolution and its impact on the Chinese Revolution. At the same time, this publishing house is also preparing to publish books about Sino-Soviet friendship and introducing the Soviet Union, such as "A History of Sino-Soviet Friendship," "Eternal Friendship - Voroshilov's Collection of Writings on Visiting China," "Reminiscences of Old Chinese Workers Who Participated in the October Revolution," "The Soviet Union," and "Learning from the Soviet Union's Spirit of Thrift and National Construction." The People's Literature Publishing House will also publish famous works on Soviet literature and art, such as "Iron Flood," "Destruction," "Chapaev" (old translation "Xia Boyang"), "The Road to Calvary" (Volumes 1 and 2), "People from the Backwoods," "And Quiet Flows the Don" (Volumes 3 and 4), "Pedagogical Poem" (Volumes 1 and 2), and Mayakovsky's "Lenin" (poem). In addition, the People's Fine Arts Publishing House, the Writers Publishing House, as well as the Finance and Economics, People's Sports, and Science Popularization Publishing Houses will also publish books, journals, and propaganda posters related to the commemoration of the October Revolution.

In order to adapt to the above publishing plan, the Xinhua Bookstore Main Store has made arrangements for distribution work.
