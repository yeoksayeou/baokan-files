　　Mobilize All Forces to Support Agricultural Production
Editor's Note: Today, our newspaper introduces to readers a report from the Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. The report raises some very important issues, namely that industry, commerce, culture, and education should strengthen their cooperation with agricultural production to support the great development of agricultural production. It is hoped that comrades in all relevant fields will pay attention to these issues, study these issues, strengthen cooperation in all aspects of socialist construction, and mobilize all forces to support agricultural production.

　　The Development of Agriculture Requires Cooperation From All Sides
The country's socialist industrialization and the improvement of people's lives both urgently require agriculture to develop rapidly. After the basic completion of cooperativization, the Party Central Committee timely proposed the National Agricultural Development Program (Draft), which pointed out the direction for rural work in the next seven to twelve years. The question now is whether this draft program can be realized and how to realize it.

From the experience of a year of trial implementation in Zhejiang, the target of the National Agricultural Development Program (Draft) to achieve a unit area yield of 800 jin of grain within the next ten years (i.e., by 1966) is achievable. Certain health and welfare requirements (such as eliminating the four pests) require further efforts.

The basic situation now is: the province has 34 million mu of cultivated land, subtracting 2.5 million mu of cultivated land for cash crops, leaving 31.5 million mu of cultivated land for grain. Among them, the cultivated land planted with rice currently has 26 million mu, with 20 million mu having a water conservancy irrigation capacity of more than 30 days. The average yield per mu of various types of rice in the past four years is: 356 jin for single-season early rice, 356 jin for single-season mid-season rice, 439 jin for single-season late rice, 582 jin for double-season intercropping rice, and 699 jin for double-season continuous cropping rice. From the above figures, it can be seen that the main measure for increasing grain production in Zhejiang is to change the farming system. In 1956, when drought and flood disasters were severe, large-scale high-yield examples still appeared everywhere. For example, in Wenling and Huangyan counties in the south and the suburbs of Wenzhou City, due to the large-scale planting of continuous cropping rice, the average yield per mu in the county reached more than 710 jin. Among them, Huangyan County had 140,000 mu of rice with an average yield of 900 to 1,000 jin, and 21 townships with 240,000 mu of cultivated land (accounting for 39% of the county's cultivated land) had a yield of more than 800 jin per mu. In the northern region and mountainous areas, many agricultural cooperatives have also achieved high yields over large areas.

Zhejiang Province's long-term plan for agricultural production is: first, to plant 8.5 million mu of continuous cropping rice in the plains of Wen, Tai, Ning, and Shao with better conditions, with an average yield of 1,000 jin per mu; to plant 4 million mu in the Hangjiahu Plain area, with an average yield of 900 jin per mu; and to plant 4.5 million mu in the hilly and mountainous areas of Jinhua and Jiande, with an average yield of 800 jin per mu. In this way, the province will plant 17 million mu of continuous cropping rice, producing a total of 15.64 billion jin of rice. Three million mu of double-season intercropping rice will be planted, with an average yield of 750 jin per mu, producing a total of 2.25 billion jin of rice. Five point forty million mu of single-season rice will be planted, with an average yield of 600 jin per mu, producing a total of 1.08 billion jin of rice. The total output of the above three items will be 18.96 billion jin of rice. Secondly, to expand the planting area of winter grain crops and establish a three-crop system of double-season rice and winter grain crops rotation. The province has about 5 million mu of winter fallow land. In addition to developing green manure on 3 million mu, another 2 million mu can be planted with early-maturing barley, with an average yield of 250 jin per mu, which can increase grain production by 500 million jin. In the southern and central regions, 4 million mu of grass seed fields can be intercropped with barley, with an average yield of 150 jin per mu, which can increase grain production by 600 million jin. Adding the original 9.2 million mu planted with barley, wheat, broad beans, peas, etc., the total output of winter grain crops can reach 3.2 billion jin. Third, to expand the planting area of high-yield dryland crops and increase the yield per unit area. It is required to plant 2.02 million mu of sweet potatoes, with an average yield of 1,000 jin per mu; 500,000 mu of arrowhead, with an average yield of 1,300 jin per mu; 700,000 mu of potatoes and taro, with an average yield of 800 jin per mu. The total output of the above tubers can reach 3.23 billion jin. One point sixty million mu of corn will be planted, with an average yield of 300 jin per mu, producing a total of 480 million jin. The total output of the above three items of rice, winter crops, and miscellaneous grains can reach about 26.05 billion jin.

To achieve the above yield increase targets, there must be reliable material guarantees. The first is fertilizer. The way to solve the fertilizer problem is: (1) Raising pigs to accumulate manure. The number of pigs raised in the province at the end of 1956 increased by 1,087,000 heads compared to the end of 1955, reaching 3,735,000 heads; an average of 1.4 households raised one pig. Among them, 13 counties averaged about 1.5 pigs per household. There are many cases where townships and cooperatives averaged more than 3 pigs per household. Therefore, as long as we strengthen leadership, the plan to raise an average of 4 pigs per household by 1967, with 20 million pigs in the province, and 2 pigs per 3 mu of land, is achievable. If each pig's manure is used to fertilize 2 mu of land, it can meet the fertilizer needs of 40 million mu of crops. (2) Planting green manure well. By 1967, the province plans to plant 14 million mu of green manure, with a unit yield that can reach 4,000 jin, more than double that of 1957. If each mu of grain crop needs 2,000 jin of green manure, a total of 28 million mu of land can be fertilized. (3) Increasing chemical fertilizer. If Zhejiang produces 500,000 tons of chemical fertilizer during the third five-year plan period, an average of about 30 jin can be applied per mu of cultivated land. According to research by the Provincial Agricultural Department, to make the annual output per mu of cultivated land reach more than 800 jin, about 25 jin of nitrogen is needed, in addition to phosphorus and potassium. The above fertilizer sources can basically meet this requirement.

The second is to actively build water conservancy projects, improve irrigation conditions, and reduce water and drought disasters. In the future, in terms of irrigation, it is planned to build large-scale water conservancy projects in the Wental Plain, the Yongjiang River Basin, and other places, to universally mobilize the masses to build various medium and small-sized farmland water conservancy projects, and to strengthen irrigation management, so that the drought resistance capacity of the province's 26 million mu of paddy fields will generally increase by 25 days on the basis of 1955. In terms of drainage, in the Taihu Lake Basin, the main task at present is to mobilize the masses to vigorously repair embankments and dredge rivers and canals, and to jointly formulate and gradually implement a fundamental cure plan for Taihu Lake with neighboring provinces; in the coastal plains, the main task is to dig rivers and canals and build culverts and sluice gates; in the plains along the rivers, the main task is to dig canals along the mountains to intercept diverted water, and to combine this with the construction of large-scale drainage projects to strive to basically eliminate general flood disasters. In terms of flood prevention, the main task is to strengthen the dikes of the Qiantang River, Puyang River, Cao'e River, East and West Tiaoxi Rivers, etc., to ensure that they will not collapse and cause disasters in the event of strong typhoon storms. In addition, we must do a good job in labor arrangement, gradually improve tools, prevent and control pests and diseases, promote improved varieties, and improve cultivation techniques.

According to the above requirements, the province's grain output must increase by an average of about 5% per year. This is double the rate of 2.25% per year in the first four years of the first five-year plan. However, judging from the increase in grain production since cooperativization, this requirement is also achievable. According to statistics from the investigation materials of 2,058 representative cooperatives in 64 counties in 1956, grain production increased in 60.5%, remained at the same level as the previous year in 2.3%, and decreased in 37.2%, with 47% of agricultural cooperatives increasing production by more than 5%.

1956 was a year of severe disasters, and most cooperatives were newly established. Under such circumstances, 47% of cooperatives were still able to increase production by more than 5%. Then, in the future, with the continuous improvement of cooperative management experience, the gradual increase in technical measures, the gradual development of farmland water conservancy construction, the gradual increase in fertilizer and agricultural capital, the continuous improvement and increase of agricultural tools, etc., it should be entirely possible to increase average yield by about 5% per year.

Of course, many difficulties may be encountered in the process of realizing the production increase plan. For example, agricultural production is greatly affected by natural conditions and disasters; it is not easy to improve the water conservancy conditions of 43% of the cultivated land area, to solve the problem of labor shortage after increasing the planting of continuous cropping rice, to ensure sufficient fertilizer, and to overcome the backward state of agricultural technology. In addition to relying on the strength of agricultural cooperatives, many problems must also be solved through close cooperation from industry, commerce, culture, and education.

　　The Relationship Between Industry and Agriculture
Realizing industrialization is the central task of national construction. Only when the country is industrialized can the face of agriculture be fundamentally changed; and the active development of agriculture has an extremely important impact on accelerating the speed of industrialization. Therefore, industry and agriculture must actively support each other and cooperate closely. We have not studied the issue of how to coordinate the development of industry and agriculture in practice enough, and have only studied a few items that agriculture requires industry to solve.

Regarding the issue of solving the supply of chemical fertilizers. In March of this year, when we were studying the issue of increasing agricultural production this year, we found that the difficulty in the supply of fertilizers was very great. The state plans to reduce the supply of chemical fertilizers to Zhejiang Province this year from 150,000 tons last year to 125,000 tons, and the supply of cake fertilizer from 44,900 tons to 24,000 tons, and there is no guarantee that it can be supplied on time. The results of the research by the Zhejiang Agricultural Science Institute show that whether crops can achieve high yields, in addition to general natural conditions and cultivation technical conditions, the determining factor is the amount of fertilizer used and whether it is used reasonably. According to the results of many years of experiments, under the same conditions, if chemical fertilizers are used in a timely and reasonable manner, an average of more than five jin of grain can be increased for every jin of nitrogen fertilizer. Judging from the situation in Zhejiang, the construction of a calcium cyanamide fertilizer plant already has many favorable conditions, but there are difficulties in infrastructure investment. According to the current financial system, it is difficult for local governments to raise funds on their own. It is recommended that the central government appropriately solve this problem in terms of industrial investment.

The specific path of agricultural mechanization is also a problem that urgently needs to be studied. According to the principles of low investment, quick results, high yield increase, and high economic benefits, the main direction of agricultural tool reform in Zhejiang's rice-growing areas should be the promotion of rice transplanters, rice harvesters, and water pumps. Rice fields in Zhejiang account for 76.4% of the total cultivated land area. If these agricultural tool problems are solved, the difficulty of labor shortage after expanding the planting of continuous cropping rice will also be solved. In addition to water conservancy and fertilizer conditions, the most important condition for expanding the planting of continuous cropping rice is labor conditions. Zhejiang has an average of only 1.7 mu of cultivated land per agricultural population, and labor is generally not lacking. However, continuous cropping rice has strong seasonality. Continuous cropping late rice must be transplanted before the Beginning of Autumn, and the earlier the transplanting, the higher the yield. If it is late, the yield will be greatly reduced, and if it is too late, there will be no harvest. From the Great Heat to harvest early rice (early rice matures at different times depending on the region and variety, and some mature ten days before the Great Heat), in half a month, it is necessary to carry out farming activities such as harvesting rice, threshing rice, carrying rice straw, loosening the soil, watering, pulling seedlings, transplanting seedlings, weeding, and topdressing fertilizer, with an average of four to five workdays required per mu. Each able-bodied laborer can only bear about four mu. In 1956, because there was no experience, some places planted too much, so that 920,000 mu of continuous cropping late rice were not transplanted, and 1.3 million mu were transplanted after the Beginning of Autumn, resulting in a serious reduction in yield. There were also large losses in the rush to harvest early rice. To solve the problem of seasonal labor shortage, in addition to matching varieties well, rationally organizing and arranging labor, it is also necessary to start from improving tools. The most labor-intensive tasks for planting continuous cropping rice are transplanting, harvesting rice, and watering. It takes one workday to transplant seedlings six inches square on one mu, and it also takes one workday to harvest rice. The rice transplanter trial-produced by the Nanjing East China Agricultural Science Institute can transplant 30 mu per day, and the existing horse-drawn harvester can harvest 6 mu per day. Although these agricultural tools still have some technical problems that have not been solved, they have basically been successfully tested. The main problem at present is that the importance of these agricultural tools has not received enough attention. Therefore, the testing, improvement, and promotion of these agricultural tools still need to be further strengthened. For example, the main problem in raising pigs is the shortage of feed. Every year, people and pigs compete for grain, and pigs always lose to people. If we do not find another way, pig production cannot achieve great development. Chemical tests have proven that rice straw, corn stalks, and other grain stalks contain rich carbohydrates, proteins, and other nutrients. The problem is that they must be crushed so that pigs can digest and absorb them. The existing multi-functional suction hammer mill can achieve this requirement. If each cooperative has a multi-functional suction hammer mill, it can fully utilize the stalks of grain, plus green fodder and bran, and the feed problem of raising an average of four pigs per household can be solved.

In terms of marine fisheries, Zhejiang conducted experiments in 1954 and found that the output of motorized sailing vessels was 68% higher than that of sailing vessels of the same tonnage per labor day; after deducting fuel consumption and depreciation costs, the profit was 38.3% higher; the cost of each pair of motorized sailing vessels was equivalent to four times the cost of sailing vessels of the same tonnage, but because its output was high, the cost could be recovered in two years if the increase in output was calculated.

The development of agriculture, forestry, fishery, animal husbandry, and sideline occupations all urgently requires the improvement of tools. Because the original tools are very backward, significant increases in production can be achieved with only slight improvements. In the era of small-scale peasant economy, the promotion of new-style agricultural tools was greatly limited. Cooperative economies have the potential to increase new-style agricultural tools with their own accumulation. At the same time, only by obtaining significant increases in production from increasing new-style agricultural tools can farmers experience the superiority of the cooperative economy in their daily labor. However, such a major event as the research and production of new-style agricultural tools has very little local technical strength, and the support of national scientific research and mechanical industry strength in this area is still insufficient. Therefore, many things that could be improved have not been improved as they should be, and many things that could be promoted have not been promoted as they should be. It is recommended that research institutions of agricultural tools at all levels be strengthened in the future, that some engineers be absorbed to participate, and that they be given convenience in their work, so that they can conduct research themselves on the one hand, and summarize the creations of farmers and handicraftsmen in practice on the other hand, and continuously conduct research and trial production, so that the work of improving agricultural tools can be greatly promoted.

When we studied the difficulty of solving the problem of industrial raw materials, we saw that agriculture also has great potential in developing the production of industrial raw materials; if rural sideline occupations can be produced in coordination with the needs of industrial production, it can also greatly increase the income of cooperatives. For example, Zhejiang's ramie production was only 748,000 dan in 1950. After the establishment of the Zhejiang Flax Textile Factory in 1951, in order to ensure the supply of raw materials, strengthen production guidance to flax farmers, and pay attention to the economic benefits of flax farmers, the output rapidly increased to 2,718,000 dan in 1952, and flax farmers' net income from planting flax increased by about 100% compared to planting a season of grain. In order to solve the raw material supply problem of milk, the Wenzhou Condensed Milk Factory organized farmers to raise cattle in nearby areas, gave them technical guidance and stable prices, and the number of cattle increased rapidly, which not only ensured the raw material supply of the factory but also increased the income of farmers in the nearby areas. Conversely, Zhejiang's ramie production in 1936 was 197,000 dan. Because there was no local processing industry, the market was unstable, and the prices were unreasonable, the output declined year by year, falling to 20,000 dan in 1950. Although we have tried our best to restore it in recent years, it only recovered to 42,000 dan in 1956. Many cooperatives in rural areas feel that there are not many ways to develop sideline occupations, and many factories in cities feel that there is a shortage of raw materials. This is the result of insufficient cooperation between industry and agriculture.

The relationship between handicrafts and agriculture is also very close. Some handicraft cooperatives are the guides and organizers of agricultural cooperatives' sideline occupations. For example, in the production of earth iron, iron smelting is done by professional handicraftsmen, and iron sand panning is a sideline occupation run by farmers; another example is handicraft supply and marketing cooperatives such as lace, hemp hats, and embroidered clothing, which not only provide technical guidance to farmers' sideline occupations, but also organize farmers to engage in part-time production by supplying raw materials and recovering finished products; and some handicraftsmen organize farmers to process semi-finished products to provide raw materials for urban industries. There have been many forms of cooperation like these in history. After cooperativization, due to the influence of one-sided emphasis on self-contained systems, insufficient attention to decentralization and diversity, some cooperative relationships have tended to be undermined. In order to promote the development of agricultural and sideline occupations and handicraft production, further research should be conducted on the cooperation between the two.

　　动员各种力量支援农业生产
    编者按　本报今天向读者介绍一份中共浙江省委给中共中央的报告。报告中提出了一些很重要的问题，这就是工业、商业、文化教育各方面应该加强同农业生产的协作，以支援农业生产的大发展。希望各有关方面的同志重视这些问题，研究这些问题，加强社会主义建设中各方面的协作，动员各种力量支援农业生产。
    发展农业需要各方面的协作
    国家社会主义工业化和人民生活的改善都迫切要求农业能够迅速地发展。在基本上完成合作化以后，党中央及时地提出了全国农业发展纲要（草案），给今后七年至十二年的农村工作指明了道路。现在的问题是：这个纲要草案是否可以实现，以及如何实现。
    从浙江试行一年的情况看，全国农业发展纲要（草案）提出的在今后十年以内（即到1966年）粮食单位面积产量达到八百斤的指标，是可以实现的。某些卫生福利要求（如除四害等）则需要进一步努力。
    现在的基本情况是：全省耕地面积三千四百万亩，减去经济作物耕地面积二百五十万亩，粮食耕地面积三千一百五十万亩。其中种植水稻的耕地面积目前有二千六百万亩，有二千万亩水利灌溉能力在三十天以上。各类稻谷过去四年每亩平均产量是：单季早稻三百五十六斤，单季中稻三百五十六斤，单季晚稻四百三十九斤，双季间作稻五百八十二斤，双季连作稻六百九十九斤。从上述数字可以看到浙江粮食增产的主要措施是改变耕作制度。1956年旱涝灾害严重，各地仍普遍出现大面积高额丰产事例，如南部温岭、黄岩两县和温州市郊区，由于大量种植连作稻，全县每亩平均产量达到七百一十斤以上，其中黄岩县有十四万亩水稻平均产量为九百斤到一千斤，有二十一个乡二十四万亩耕地（占全县耕地面积的39％）每亩产量八百斤以上。北部地区和山区，也有许多农业社取得了大面积的高额产量。
    浙江省农业生产的远景规划是：第一，连作稻在条件较好的温、台、宁、绍平原种植八百五十万亩，平均每亩产量达到一千斤；杭嘉湖平原地区种植四百万亩，平均每亩产量达到九百斤；金华、建德等丘陵地区和山区种植四百五十万亩，平均每亩产量八百斤。这样全省种植一千七百万亩连作稻，共产稻谷一百五十六亿四千万斤。双季间作稻种植三百万亩，平均每亩产七百五十斤，共产稻谷二十二亿五千万斤。单季稻五百四十万亩，平均每亩产量六百斤，共产稻谷十亿八千万斤。以上三项共产稻谷一百八十九亿六千万斤。其次，扩大冬季粮食作物的种植面积，建立双季稻、冬季粮食作物轮作的三熟制。全省有冬闲田地五百万亩左右，除了以三百万亩发展绿肥以外，还有二百万亩可以种植早熟大麦，平均每亩产量以二百五十斤计算，可以增产粮食五亿斤。南部及中部地区，有四百万亩草子田可以间种大麦，平均每亩产量以一百五十斤计算，可以增产粮食六亿斤。加上原来种植的大麦、小麦、蚕豆、豌豆等九百二十万亩，冬季粮食作物的总产量可以达到三十二亿斤。第三，扩大旱地高产量作物的种植面积，提高单位面积产量。要求种植甘薯二百零二万亩，平均每亩产量一千斤；蕉藕五十万亩，每亩产量一千三百斤；马铃薯、芋艿七十万亩，每亩产量八百斤。以上薯类总产量可以达到三十二亿三千万斤。玉米一百六十万亩，平均每亩产量三百斤，共产四亿八千万斤。以上水稻、冬作、杂粮三项总产量可以达到二百六十亿五千万斤左右。
    要实现以上增产指标，还必须有可靠的物质保证。第一是肥料。解决肥料的办法是：（1）养猪积肥。全省养猪的头数1956年年终比1955年年终增加一百零八万七千头，达到三百七十三万五千头；平均一·四户喂养一头。其中有十三个县平均每户喂养一·五头左右。乡、社平均每户喂养三头以上的事例很多。因此，只要加强领导，1967年每户平均养猪四头，全省养猪二千万头，每三亩地有猪二头的计划是可以实现的。如果以每头猪的厩肥肥田二亩计算，就可以满足四千万亩作物所需要的肥料。（2）种好绿肥。到1967年，全省计划种植绿肥一千四百万亩，单位产量可以达到四千斤，比1957年增加一倍以上。以每亩粮食作物需要绿肥二千斤计算，共可肥田二千八百万亩。（3）增加化肥。浙江如果在第三个五年计划期内生产化肥五十万吨，平均每亩耕地可施三十斤左右。据省农业部门的研究，要使每亩耕地年产量达到八百斤以上，除磷素、钾素外，约需氮素二十五斤左右。以上肥料来源，可以基本满足这个要求。
    第二是积极兴修水利，改善灌溉条件，减轻水旱灾害。今后计划在灌溉方面，兴办温台平原、甬江流域等地的大型水利工程，普遍发动群众兴修各种各样的中、小型农田水利，加强灌溉管理，使全省二千六百万亩水田的抗旱能力在1955年的基础上普遍提高二十五天。在排涝方面，太湖流域，目前主要是发动群众，大力培修圩堤，疏浚河渠，并与邻省共同制订和逐步实现太湖的根治规划；滨海平原，主要是开挖河渠，兴建涵闸陡门；沿江沿河平原，主要是沿山开渠，截除客水，并且结合举办大型排水工程，争取基本上消除一般涝灾。在防洪方面，主要是加固钱塘江、浦阳江、曹娥江、东西苕溪等堤防，保证在强大的台风暴雨袭击的时候，不致溃决成灾。此外，要做好劳力安排工作，逐步改进工具，防治病虫害，推广优良品种，改进栽培技术等。
    根据以上要求，本省粮食产量要每年平均递增5％左右。这个比第一个五年计划前四年每年平均递增2.25％的比例是加倍地增长了。但从合作化以后粮食增产的情况来看，这个要求也是可以实现的。根据1956年在六十四个县二千零五十八个具有代表性的合作社的调查材料统计，粮食增产的占60.5％，保持上年水平的占2.3％，减产的占37.2％，有47％的农业社，增产在5％以上。
    1956年是灾情严重的一年，大多数合作社又是新建的，在这样的情况下，47％的合作社还能够增产5％以上。那么，在今后合作社经营管理经验不断提高，技术措施逐步增多，农田水利建设逐渐发展，肥料农本逐步增加，农具不断改进和增多等等条件之下，每年平均产量递增5％左右应该说是完全可能的。
    当然，在实现增产计划的过程中是可能遇到很多的困难。例如：农业生产受自然条件和灾害的影响很大；要改善占耕地面积43％的水利条件，要解决增播连作稻以后的劳力紧张问题，要保证有足够的肥料，要克服农业技术的落后状态，都不是轻而易举的事情。除了依靠农业合作社的力量外，有许多问题还必须从工业、商业和文化教育方面的密切协作中来求得解决。
    工业和农业的关系
    实现工业化是国家建设的中心任务，只有国家工业化了，才能根本改变农业的面貌；而积极发展农业又对加快工业化的速度有极其重大的影响。因此，工业和农业必须主动支援，密切协作。如何在实践中使工业和农业相互配合发展的问题，我们研究得还很不够，仅对农业发展中要求工业解决的几个项目作了研究。
    关于解决化学肥料的供应问题。今年3月我们在研究今年农业增产的问题中，发现肥料供应的困难很大。国家今年计划供应浙江省的化学肥料由去年的十五万吨减到十二万五千吨，饼肥由四万四千九百吨减到二万四千吨，能否按时供应还无保证。浙江农业科学研究所研究的结果，认为农作物能否取得高额产量，除了一般的自然条件和栽培技术条件以外，决定的条件是肥料使用的多少和使用的是否合理。根据多年实验的结果，在相同的条件下，如果使用化学肥料及时、合理，平均每斤氮素肥料可以增产粮食五斤以上。从浙江的情况看，建设石灰氮肥厂已经有了许多有利条件，但是基建投资有困难，按照现在的财政体制，地方自筹是困难的，建议中央在工业投资方面适当解决这一问题。
    农业机械化的具体道路，也是一个急需研究的问题。按照投资少、收效快、增产多、经济效益高的原则，目前浙江农具改革的主要方向，在稻区应该是推广插秧机、割稻机和抽水机。浙江稻田占总耕地面积的76.4％，如果这些农具问题解决了，扩种连作稻后劳动力紧张的困难也就解决了。扩种连作稻除了水利、肥料条件以外，最主要的是劳力条件。浙江平均每个农业人口只有一·七亩耕地，劳力一般是不缺的，但是连作稻的季节性很强，连作晚稻要在立秋前插上秧，越早产量越高，晚了则减产很大，过晚则颗粒无收。从大暑割早稻起（早稻因地区、品种不同，成熟期也不同，有的是在大暑前十天成熟的），半个月内要进行割稻、打稻、担稻草、松土、车水、拔秧、插秧、耘田、追肥等项农活，平均每亩要用工四个到五个。每个整劳动力只能负担四亩左右。1956年因为没有经验，有的地方种多了，以致连作晚稻有九十二万亩没有插下秧，有一百三十万亩在立秋后插秧严重减产。早稻抢收，损失也很大。要解决季节性的劳力紧张问题，除了搭配好品种，合理组织和安排劳力以外，还必须从改进工具着眼。种连作稻费工最大的是插秧、割稻、车水。插六寸见方的秧一亩需要劳动力一工，割稻也需要一工。而现在南京华东农业科学研究所试制的插秧机每天可插三十亩，现有的马拉收割机每天可割六亩，这些农具虽然还有一些技术问题没有解决，但是基本上已经试验成功了。目前主要的问题是这些农具的重要性还未引起我们足够的注意。因此对于这些农具的试验、改进和推广工作，还需要进一步地加强。又如养猪的主要问题是饲料不足，每年人猪争粮，猪总是争不过人的，不另找出路就不能使养猪生产获得大发展。经化验证明：稻草、玉米杆等谷物茎杆都含有丰富的炭水化合物、蛋白质等养分，问题是必须磨碎，使猪吃了能够消化吸收。现有的万能吸风锤研机可以实现这个要求。每个合作社如果有一架万能吸风锤研机，就可以把谷物的茎杆充分利用起来，再加青饲料及糠麸等，平均每户养猪四头的饲料问题就可以得到解决。
    在海洋渔业方面，浙江在1954年作了试验，机帆船的产量比起同吨位的帆船，每一个劳动日所获得的产量要高68％；减去燃料消耗和折旧费后，收益要多38.3％；每对机帆船的造价相等于同吨位帆船造价的四倍，但是，因为它的产量高，如果拿增产的数字计算，二年就可以收回成本。
    农、林、渔、牧、副业的发展，都迫切地要求改进工具。因为原来的工具很落后，只要稍为改进，就可以有显著的增产。在小农经济时代，新式农具的推广受到很大的限制，合作经济有可能以自己的积累来增加新式农具。同时，只有从增加新式农具方面获得显著增产，才能使农民在日常劳动中体会到合作化经济的优越性。但是像新式农具的研究和生产这样一件大事，地方技术力量很少，国家科学研究和机械工业力量在这方面的支援也还是不够的。因此，许多可以改进的没有获得应有的改进，许多可以推广的没有获得应有的推广。建议今后加强各级农具研究机构，吸收一些工程师参加，给予工作上的便利，使他们一方面自己进行研究，另方面又总结农民、手工业者在实践中的创造，不断进行研究和试制，使改良农具的工作大大推进一步。
    我们在研究解决工业原料困难的时候，看到农业在发展工业原料的生产方面潜力也是很大的；农村副业如果能够配合工业生产的需要进行生产，也可以大大增加合作社的收入。例如浙江的络麻，1950年产量只有七十四万八千担，1951年浙江麻纺织厂建立以后，为了保证原料供给，加强对麻农的生产指导和注意麻农的经济利益，到1952年产量迅速提高到二百七十一万八千担，麻农种麻比种植一季粮食纯收入增加达一倍左右。温州炼乳厂为了解决牛乳的原料供应问题，在附近地区组织农民养牛，给以技术指导和稳定的价格，牛的数量增加很快，既保证了该厂的原料供应，也增加了附近地区农民的收入。相反地，浙江苎麻生产1936年产量有十九万七千担，由于当地没有加工工业，市场不稳定，价格不合理，因此，产量逐年下降，到1950年下降到二万担，最近几年虽然尽力恢复，1956年也仅仅恢复到四万二千担。在农村有不少的合作社感到发展副业门路不多，在城市又有不少的工厂感到原料不足，这都是工农业协作不够的结果。
    手工业和农业关系也很密切。有些手工业合作社是农业合作社经营副业的指导者与组织者。例如土铁业生产，炼铁的是专业手工业者，淘铁砂是农民兼营的副业；又如花边、麻帽、绣衣等手工供销合作社，既对农民副业在技术上给以指导，又通过供给原料、收回成品的方法组织农民进行业余生产；还有些手工业者组织农民加工半成品为城市工业提供原料。历史上这些协作形式是很多的，合作化以后由于片面强调自成系统的影响，照顾分散性和多样性不够，某些协作关系有受到破坏的趋势。为了推动农副业和手工业生产的发展，应当进一步研究两者之间的协作。
