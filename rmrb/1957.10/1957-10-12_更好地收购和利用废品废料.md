　　Better Acquisition and Utilization of Waste Products
　　*People's Daily* Commentator

　　Acquiring and utilizing waste products is a good tradition of diligence and frugality that has always existed in our country. Since liberation, with the restoration and development of the national economy, the waste products of industrial and mining enterprises have been increasing day by day; with the gradual improvement of people's living standards, the waste products among the people have also been increasing day by day. At the same time, the departments that need waste products are also gradually increasing. In particular, handicrafts have always used a large part of waste products as raw materials. After cooperation, productivity has increased, and the need for waste products has also increased. Some large industries (such as paper-making, bone fertilizer, etc.) have made the use of waste products (such as various waste fibers, miscellaneous bones, etc.) an important source of raw materials. This change requires that the acquisition and supply of waste products must be gradually strengthened in a planned way. In particular, some important materials needed for national industrial construction (such as waste copper, waste tin, waste lead, waste iron, etc.), in the current situation of material shortage, must be under unified management and planned acquisition and distribution.

　　In 1952, the supply and marketing cooperative system in our country established an agency specializing in the acquisition and supply of waste products. By 1956, the waste products acquired by supply and marketing cooperatives in various places had more than 700 kinds, and the annual acquisition volume reached more than 1.26 million tons. The private merchants and peddlers who originally operated waste products, including "rag pickers," "scrap buyers," "second-hand goods stores," and specialized waste product stores that sold after sorting and sorting, have also realized socialist transformation. The specialized management agencies plan their business scope, strengthen their political and ideological education, and provide business guidance, so that their operating style has improved and they can better serve production. However, due to the scattered sources of waste products and the complexity of varieties, there have been many changes in the original purchase and sale relationship and the laws of material circulation in the process of socialist transformation and economic reorganization. Therefore, there are still many problems in both acquisition and supply. For example, several units in one region are arguing with each other and raising prices when purchasing; some units blindly purchase and transport back and forth, causing waste; some units do not abide by market management regulations and arbitrarily purchase and sell materials that the state stipulates for unified purchase, affecting market management; some operating units only take care of unified purchase, failing to guarantee the needs of production units, and failing to take care of the original reasonable purchase and sale relationships and cooperative relationships of production units; other units have more operating links, untimely supply, and unreasonable prices, affecting the costs of production units. In the distribution and supply work, there are also some contradictions between the departments responsible for acquisition and the handicraft departments that need to use waste products locally, between large industries and handicrafts that need waste products, and between regions.

　　In order to solve these problems and contradictions, and further strengthen the work of acquiring and utilizing waste products, we believe that all localities should first adopt different acquisition methods according to the uses and supply and demand of various waste products. For waste copper, waste tin, waste lead, waste steel and other materials that the state has stipulated for unified purchase, the acquisition methods and supply principles pointed out in the State Council's "Regulations on Prohibiting Agricultural Products and Other Materials Acquired by the State Plan and Unified Purchase from Entering the Free Market" should be strictly implemented. For waste iron, waste rubber, waste tires and other resources that are insufficient, in great demand, and are important raw materials needed by both industry and handicrafts, unified acquisition can be carried out within the scope of provinces and cities, and planned supply can be made in order to better arrange production and strengthen market management. As for general waste products, because there are many varieties, some of which have not been fully utilized in the past. Therefore, in addition to the part of handicrafts that are collected and used by themselves, it is suitable for commercial specialized management agencies to take overall planning, strengthen acquisition work, and strengthen the leadership and management of private merchants and peddlers, so as to more widely and reasonably utilize these materials and gradually achieve planned distribution and supply. When purchasing, commercial departments should pay attention to maintaining the original reasonable purchasing relationships and cooperative relationships of the units in need (mainly handicraft cooperatives). For the general waste products required by handicraft cooperatives that are not included in the unified purchase, self-collection and self-use can be allowed, so as to give play to the enthusiasm of handicraft cooperatives in utilizing waste products and maintaining the convenience of local utilization. Of course, the self-purchasing of handicraft cooperatives should be limited to a part needed for their own production, and they must not engage in commercial operations; they must strictly abide by local market management in terms of prices, etc.

　　Secondly, in the distribution and supply of waste products, different supply principles should be grasped according to different varieties. Except for the materials that the state stipulates for unified purchase, other waste products are not suitable for long-distance transportation, and should generally be supplied locally first, and then supplied to other places; the raw materials belonging to paper making should be supplied to large industries as soon as possible, while taking care of the needs of handicrafts. In the past, the acquisition departments paid more attention to the acquisition work and did not pay much attention to the distribution and supply work. In the future, these two aspects of work should be combined and the spirit of acquisition serving production should be earnestly implemented.

　　Thirdly, commercial departments should supply waste products in a timely manner and at reasonable prices. Otherwise, industry and handicrafts cannot fully utilize these materials, or because of the high prices, the product costs and selling prices will be affected. The commercial departments in various places that operate waste products should also pay attention to improving business management, reducing links, reducing sales prices, and striving to expand the scope of acquisition and utilization.

　　Finally, we hope that the commercial departments that operate waste products and the production departments that utilize waste products, especially handicraft cooperatives, will cooperate closely to do a good job in the acquisition and utilization of waste products; and we hope that party committees and governments at all levels will strengthen their leadership over this work.

　　更好地收购和利用废品废料
　　本报评论员
    收购和利用废品废料，是我国历来就有的勤俭节约的良好传统。解放以后，随着国民经济的恢复和发展，工矿企业的废品废料日益增多；随着人民生活水平的逐步提高，民间的废品废料也日益增多了。同时，需要废品废料的部门也逐渐增加。特别是手工业，原来就有很大一部分是以废品废料作原料的，合作化以后，生产力提高了，对于废品废料的需要也随着增加。有些大工业（如造纸、骨肥等工厂），利用废品废料（如各种废纤维品、杂骨等）已成为生产原料的重要来源之一。这种变化，要求废品废料的收购和供应工作必须逐渐加强计划性。特别是有些国家工业建设所需要的重要物资（如废铜、废锡、废铅、废钢铁等），在目前物资不足的情况下，更必须进行统一的管理和有计划的收购与分配。
    我国的供销合作社系统，在1952年建立了专营收购和供应废品废料的机构，到1956年，各地供销合作社收购的废品废料已有七百多种，全年收购数量达一百二十六万多吨。原来经营废品废料的私商小贩，包括“拾破烂的”、“收买破烂的”、“旧货屋子”以及分类整理后出售的专业废品商店等，也实现了社会主义改造，由专管机构有计划地安排他们的经营范围，加强对他们的政治思想教育和在业务上加以指导，使得他们的经营作风改善了，能够更好地为生产服务。但是，由于废品废料来源分散，品种复杂，在社会主义改造和经济改组过程中，原有的收售关系和物资流转规律又有许多变化，因此无论是收购或供应方面都还存在着不少问题。例如，一个地区有几个单位在收购时，互相扯皮，互相抬价；有些单位盲目采购，往返调运，造成浪费；有的单位不遵照市场管理办法，任意收购和出售国家规定统一收购的物资，影响市场管理；有些经营单位只顾统一收购，没有保证生产单位的需要，没有照顾生产单位原来的合理的收售关系和协作关系；还有的单位经营环节较多，供应不及时，价格不合理，影响了生产单位的成本。在分配和供应工作中，负责收购的部门同需要就地利用废品废料的手工业部门之间，同样需要废品废料的大工业同手工业之间，以及地区与地区之间，也都存在一些矛盾。
    为了解决这些问题和矛盾，进一步加强收购和利用废品废料的工作，我们认为，各地首先应当根据各种废品废料的用途和供需情况，采取不同的收购办法。对于废铜、废锡、废铅、废钢等国家已规定为统一收购的物资，应当严格执行国务院“关于由国家计划收购和统一收购的农产品和其他物资不准进入自由市场的规定”中指出的收购办法和供应原则。对于废铁、废橡胶、废轮胎等资源不足、需要面广、又是工业和手工业都需要的重要原料，可以在省市范围内统一收购，有计划地供应，以便更好地安排生产和加强市场管理。至于一般的废品废料，因为品种很多，有些过去还没有充分利用。因此除手工业自收自用的一部分外适于由商业专管机构全盘统筹，加强收购工作，加强对私商小贩的领导与管理，以便更广泛、更合理地利用这些物资和逐步作到有计划地分配和供应。商业部门在收购时，要注意保持需用单位（主要是手工业合作社）原来的合理的收购关系和协作关系，对于手工业合作社所需的未列入统一收购的一般废品废料，可以允许自收自用，以发挥手工业合作社利用废品废料的积极性和保持就地利用的便利条件。当然，手工业合作社自行采购应当只限于自己生产需要的一部分，不得从事商业经营；在价格等方面必须严格遵照当地的市场管理。
    其次，在分配和供应废品废料时，要区别不同品种掌握不同的供应原则。除了国家规定统一收购的物资外，其他废品废料不便远途调运，一般都应当先供应当地，然后再供应外地；属于造纸的原料应当尽先供应大工业，同时照顾手工业的需要。过去收购部门比较注意收购工作而不大重视分配和供应工作，今后应当把这两方面的工作结合起来，认真贯彻收购为生产服务的精神。
    再次，商业部门对废品废料要供应及时，价格合理。否则，工业和手工业就不能充分利用这些物资，或者因为价格高，影响产品成本和售价。各地经营废品废料的商业部门还应当注意改善经营管理、减少环节，降低销售价格，争取扩大收购和利用的范围。
    最后，我们希望：经营废品废料的商业部门同利用废品废料的生产部门，特别是手工业合作社，密切协作，共同做好收购和利用废品废料的工作；并且希望各级党委和政府加强对这项工作的领导。
