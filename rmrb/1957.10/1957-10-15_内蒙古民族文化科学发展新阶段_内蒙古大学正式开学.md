Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, October 14th: Inner Mongolia University, the highest institution of learning in Inner Mongolia and marking a new stage in the development of national culture and science in Inner Mongolia, officially opened in Hohhot on the 14th. At 9:00 am, more than 400 teachers and students from nine ethnic groups, including Mongolian, Han, Hui, Manchu, and Daur, held a grand opening ceremony in the newly built auditorium.

Ulanhu, Chairman of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and President of Inner Mongolia University, spoke at the opening ceremony. He said that the establishment of Inner Mongolia University is a concrete manifestation of the victory of the Chinese Communist Party's ethnic policy, a major measure by the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government to help the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region develop its cultural undertakings, and a significant achievement of the people of all ethnic groups in Inner Mongolia in developing their cultural undertakings. He expressed, on behalf of the people of all ethnic groups in Inner Mongolia, his heartfelt respect and warm gratitude to the Chinese Communist Party, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao. Ulanhu pointed out that after the establishment of Inner Mongolia University, it must, on the one hand, implement the educational policy of cultivating laborers with socialist consciousness, culture, and good health, and on the other hand, undertake the task of promoting and developing the national culture of Inner Mongolia, cultivating intellectuals of its own ethnic groups, and conducting scientific and technological research. Therefore, it is necessary to determine the key areas of various majors and scientific research at Inner Mongolia University based on the characteristics of Inner Mongolia, the needs of national and autonomous region's economic, cultural development and scientific research, in order to improve teaching quality and develop scientific research work, thereby further enriching and developing the experience of running comprehensive universities in ethnic regions. Inner Mongolia University must open its doors to the children of workers, peasants, and herdsmen, and attach importance to strengthening labor education so that intellectual labor and physical labor can be combined. He also asked teachers and students of all ethnic groups to learn from each other, help each other, and improve together, especially in conjunction with the current rectification campaign and the anti-rightist struggle, to study ethnic issues well, learn the Party's ethnic policies well, and achieve further unity among teachers, students, and cadres of all ethnic groups.

Zhou Jianren, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Higher Education, said at the meeting: Before liberation, all ethnic minorities suffered from the brutal rule of the reactionaries, resulting in the backwardness of cultural and educational undertakings. After the founding of New China, the Party and the government placed the development of education for ethnic minorities as one of the important tasks. Therefore, the educational undertakings of various ethnic minorities have greatly developed. At present, there are more than 14,000 students of various ethnic minorities in universities and colleges across the country, an increase of more than eleven times compared with 1950. In the case of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Inner Mongolia did not have a single institution of higher learning ten years ago. Now it has the Inner Mongolia Normal College, the Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine College, the Medical College, and the Inner Mongolia University that opened today. In particular, the new construction of Inner Mongolia University marks a new stage in the cultural and scientific development of Inner Mongolia.

Also speaking at the meeting were Chen Xujing, Vice President of Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou, Yan Rengeng, Assistant to the President of Peking University, Zhang Yulin, Assistant to the President of Xiamen University, Yin Jingzhi, Director of the Biology Department of Shandong University, and Ulgii Khutagt, an expert from the Mongolian People's Republic, who came to congratulate the opening of Inner Mongolia University. Tseveen Dashi, Consul General of the Mongolian People's Republic in Hohhot, also attended the ceremony.

Inner Mongolia University has eight majors in seven departments: Mongolian Language and Literature, Chinese Language and Literature, History, Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, and Biology (including Zoology and Botany). There are a total of 340 students from eight ethnic groups, of which ethnic minority students account for one-third. The school's first phase of construction covers an area of more than 29,000 square meters. The school has more than 180,000 volumes of Chinese and foreign books and has purchased various instruments and equipment worth more than 630,000 yuan, which can basically meet the teaching needs of the first academic year.

Inner Mongolia University will also add two departments of Law and Economics in the future. After the school is fully completed, it will be changed to a five-year system, and the number of students from all ethnic groups will reach more than 1,500. The building area of the school will reach more than 100,000 square meters.

Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, October 14th: Inner Mongolia University received strong support from the Ministry of Higher Education and various universities and colleges in the mainland during its construction process.

At the beginning of the preparation work for Inner Mongolia University, the central government allocated more than 3 million yuan for school building construction. The Ministry of Higher Education also allocated 60 graduate students and university graduates. More than 130 teachers were also supported by twelve universities and colleges such as Peking University, Nankai University, Fudan University, Nanjing University and Beijing Russian Language Institute to Inner Mongolia University. Domestic universities and colleges also supported Inner Mongolia University with a large number of books and instruments. Peking University is also actively arranging all intermediate-level physics experimental equipment for Inner Mongolia University. Sun Yat-sen University gave more than 500 kinds of animal and plant specimens collected in various parts of the south to Inner Mongolia University.

　　内蒙古民族文化科学发展新阶段
    内蒙古大学正式开学
    据新华社呼和浩特14日电　标志着内蒙古民族文化科学发展新阶段的内蒙古最高学府——内蒙古大学，14日在呼和浩特正式开学。上午九时，蒙古、汉、回、满、达呼尔等九个民族四百多名师生，在新建的礼堂里举行了隆重的开学典礼。
    内蒙古自治区主席、内蒙古大学校长乌兰夫在开学典礼会上讲话。他说，内蒙古大学的成立，是中国共产党的民族政策胜利的具体表现，是中国共产党、中央人民政府帮助内蒙古自治区发展文化事业的重大措施，也是内蒙古各民族人民在发展文化事业中的重大成就。他代表内蒙古各族人民衷心地向中国共产党、中央人民政府和毛主席致崇高的敬意和热烈的感谢。乌兰夫指出，内蒙古大学建立后，一方面要贯彻培养有社会主义觉悟的、有文化的、身体健康的劳动者的教育方针，另一方面要担负起繁荣和发展内蒙古民族的文化和培养本民族的知识分子，进行科学技术研究的任务。因此，必须根据内蒙古地区和民族特点、国家和自治区经济文化发展和科学研究的需要，来确定内蒙古大学各个专业的重点和科学研究的重点，以达到提高教学质量和发展科学研究工作的目的，从而进一步丰富和发展民族地区办综合大学的经验。内蒙古大学必须向工农牧民子弟开门，重视加强劳动教育，以便使智力劳动与体力劳动相结合起来。他还要求各民族师生互相学习，互相帮助，共同提高，特别要结合当前整风和反右派斗争，很好地研究民族问题，学好党的民族政策，做到各民族师生干部之间进一步的团结。
    中央高等教育部副部长周建人，在会上讲话说：解放前，各少数民族长期受着反动派残酷统治，造成文化教育事业的落后。在新中国成立后，党和政府把发展少数民族教育事业列为重要任务之一。因此，各少数民族教育事业有了很大发展。现在在全国各高等学校中，各少数民族学生已达到一万四千多人，比1950年增加了十一倍多。以内蒙古自治区的情况来说，内蒙古在十年前没有一所高等学校，现在已经有了内蒙古师范学院、畜牧兽医学院、医学院和今天开学的内蒙古大学，特别是内蒙古大学的新建，标志着内蒙古文化和科学发展的一个新阶段。
    在会上讲话的还有前来祝贺内蒙古大学开学的广州市的中山大学副校长陈序经，北京大学校长助理严仁赓，厦门大学校长助理张玉麟，山东大学生物系主任尹敬执和蒙古人民共和国专家乌力吉呼图格。参加典礼的还有蒙古人民共和国驻呼和浩特总领事策·达什。
    内蒙古大学设有蒙古语言文学、汉语言文学、历史、数学、物理、化学、生物（包括动物、植物）等七个系的八个专业。在校的八个民族学生共三百四十人，其中各少数民族学生占三分之一。学校第一期建筑面积达二万九千多平方公尺，全校拥有各种中外文图书十八万多册，并已购置了六十三万多元的各种仪器设备，基本上可以满足第一学年的教学需要。
    内蒙古大学今后还将增设法律和经济两个系。学校全部建成后将改为五年制，在校各民族学生将达到一千五百多人，校舍建筑面积将达十多万平方公尺。
    据新华社呼和浩特14日电　内蒙古大学在新建过程中，得到高等教育部和内地各高等学校的大力支援。
    内蒙古大学筹备工作一开始，中央就拨出三百多万元经费进行校舍建设。高等教育部并分配来了六十名研究生和大学毕业生。北京、南开、复旦、南京等大学和北京俄语学院等十二个院校也支援内蒙古大学一百三十多名教师。国内各高等学校还以大批图书仪器支援内蒙古大学。北京大学还正在积极为内蒙古大学安排全部中级物理试验设备。中山大学把在南方各地采集到的五百多种动植物标本送给了内蒙古大学。
