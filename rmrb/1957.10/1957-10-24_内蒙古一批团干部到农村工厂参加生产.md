To the Labor Front

    Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, October 21st: The first batch of fifteen Mongolian and Han cadres from the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Youth League, who are participating in physical labor, departed on the 21st for industrial and mining areas, pastoral areas, and semi-agricultural, semi-pastoral areas. This group of cadres includes leading cadres such as Sha Di (Mongolian ethnicity), Deputy Secretary of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Youth League. They are the vanguard of the Autonomous Region Committee of the League's plan to have all cadres take turns participating in physical labor over the next seven years.

    Most of these cadres, who voluntarily signed up to go to the countryside and factories to participate in physical labor, came from petty-bourgeois families and have not systematically received physical labor training. This time, they will participate in physical labor in agricultural and pastoral cooperatives and key construction sites as members and apprentices for one to two years, sharing weal and woe with the masses, and cultivating a style of close ties with the masses and hard work and plain living.

    Currently, League organizations in various parts of Inner Mongolia are also formulating plans for cadres to go to the countryside in batches to participate in physical labor. Baotou City has drafted a plan to transfer cadres to participate in physical labor, and the first batch of forty-seven cadres will soon depart for industrial and mining areas and rural areas.

    内蒙古一批团干部到农村工厂参加生产
    新华社呼和浩特21日电　共青团内蒙古自治区委员会第一批参加体力劳动的十五名蒙古、汉族干部，已从21日起出发前往工矿区、牧区和半农半牧区。这批干部中包括共青团内蒙古自治区委员会副书记沙涕（蒙古族）等领导干部。他们是自治区团委计划在今后七年内将所有干部轮流参加体力劳动的先头部队。
    这批自动报名下乡下厂参加体力劳动的干部，大多数出身于小资产阶级家庭，没有系统地受过体力劳动的锻炼。这次他们将在农牧业社和重点建筑工地上以社员和徒工身份参加一年到二年的体力劳动，和群众同甘共苦，培养起密切联系群众和艰苦朴素的作风。
    目前内蒙古各地团的组织也正在拟定干部分期分批轮流下乡参加体力劳动的计划。包头市抽调干部参加体力劳动的计划已经拟出，不久第一批四十七名干部就要出发到工矿区和农村中去。
