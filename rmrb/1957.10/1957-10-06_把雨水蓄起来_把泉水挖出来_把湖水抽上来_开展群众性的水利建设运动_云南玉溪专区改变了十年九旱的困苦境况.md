Store Rainwater, Dig Out Spring Water, Pump Up Lake Water
Launch a Mass Water Conservancy Construction Movement
Yuxi Prefecture, Yunnan Province, Changes Its Decade-Long Predicament of Frequent Droughts

Yuxi Prefecture consists of twelve counties, with 2,020,000 mu of cultivated land, including 1,180,000 mu of paddy fields and 840,000 mu of dry land, and an agricultural population of 1,160,000.

The entire area has dozens of tributaries of three water systems: the Nanpan River, the Jinsha River, and the Red River, as well as five lakes of varying sizes, including Dianchi Lake and Fuxian Lake, with an average annual rainfall of about 1,000 millimeters. However, 80% of the rainfall is concentrated in the summer and autumn, with water shortages in winter and spring. Water resources are abundant, but water conservancy infrastructure is very backward. In 1950, only 200,000 mu of stable paddy fields had irrigation equipment. Most of the cultivated land relied on rainwater and perennial streams for irrigation. Near rivers and lakes, fights over water, even leading to deaths, occurred every year during rice transplanting season. In areas slightly farther from rivers and lakes, "nine out of ten years were drought years," forcing people to pray to gods and offer sacrifices, waiting for rain to plant rice. Farmers were long trapped in a state of poverty: "planting for three months, harvesting for three months, and eating for three months." After the land reform was basically completed in early 1953, some small-scale water conservancy projects were built every year. In early 1956, after the basic completion of advanced agricultural cooperatives, encouraged by the National Agricultural Development Program and under the specific guidance of the higher-level Party committees, we implemented the principle of "run by the people with government assistance" and launched an unprecedented mass water conservancy construction movement in the entire region. From the winter of 1956 to the spring of 1957 alone, 7,070,000 labor days of ordinary workers and 600,000 labor days of skilled workers were mobilized. In total, during the First Five-Year Plan, the region contributed 15,000,000 labor days, building more than 13,000 small- and medium-sized water conservancy projects (including 19 medium-sized projects capable of irrigating more than 3,000 mu), and installing 119 water pumps, ensuring that every county had a reservoir and every township had a dam or pond. As a result, the area of stable paddy fields in the region expanded to 800,000 mu, four times the pre-liberation level. In normal years, 80% of the paddy fields can be guaranteed to plant rice according to the season. It is estimated that this single measure will increase rice production by 70 jin per mu. Combined with other measures, it is projected that the average yield of rice per mu in the region will reach 628 jin in 1957, an increase of 35.9% compared to 1952 (462 jin per mu), a year of favorable weather. The total grain output is expected to increase by 41% compared to 1952, and the grain output per agricultural person will increase from 514 jin in 1952 to 718 jin.

Over the past few years, in mobilizing the masses and launching the water conservancy construction movement, we have had the following insights:

(1) Clarify that water conservancy is the center of agricultural basic construction and establish the idea of "demanding water from nature" among all farmers. In the winter of 1955, during the publicity and discussion of the National Agricultural Development Program, we calculated the water conservancy accounts among farmers and cadres throughout the region based on the guiding ideology of "water conservancy is the center of agricultural basic construction in our province" put forward by the Provincial Party Committee. We compared the different yields of dry land and paddy fields, dry land and irrigated land, "thunderstorm fields" (fields that can only be planted after heavy rains) and stable paddy fields. We used the fact that some areas had achieved significant production increases in the previous two years due to the construction of some water conservancy projects to educate and inspire the enthusiasm of the masses for water conservancy construction.

(2) Adapt to local conditions and develop water resources from all aspects. Through gradual exploration, we summarized the experiences of the masses based on the complex terrain and concentrated rainfall characteristics of Yunnan and proposed the slogan "Store rainwater, dig out spring water, and pump up lake water." We promoted small-scale projects as the mainstay, adapting to local conditions, using various forms, fully utilizing water resources, and leveraging the wisdom of the masses to create methods that cost little and yield quick results. In mountainous areas, we promoted "where land is reclaimed, water conservancy is built," "how high the fields are, how high the water must be," using methods such as digging ponds on hillsides, opening ditches along mountains, building dams to intercept water, and erecting flumes to carry water. In dam areas, we adopted methods such as building river dams, diverting river water, building terraced dams, and constructing reservoirs, adopting "long vine bearing melons" (combining ditch irrigation with dam and pond storage) to fully utilize river and lake water sources, which can both resist drought and prevent floods.

(3) Overcome the "government-run" mentality, implement the principle of "run by the people with government assistance," rely on the masses, and run water conservancy thriftily. Before cooperativization, water conservancy construction relied mostly on state investment or loans, which was necessary at the time. However, due to insufficient education, it fostered the idea among cadres and the masses that they should rely on the government to "officially run" water conservancy. As soon as construction started, they would reach out to higher authorities for money. Some farmers even believed that water conservancy construction was "helping the government with affairs, eating after the bell rings, and getting money after stamping the seal." As the water conservancy movement developed, more and more projects were built, and the construction costs increased. Under the pressure of objective circumstances, we have continuously reversed the "government-run" mentality of cadres and educated the masses to rely on their own strength to run water conservancy over the past two years. After advanced cooperativization, favorable conditions were created for running water conservancy for the people. This year, the earthwork for water conservancy projects is generally borne by the cooperatives. The wages of skilled workers, tools, and equipment, in addition to appropriate state subsidies, are also resolved by the cooperatives as much as possible. This has stimulated the enthusiasm of Party committees and cooperatives at all levels to raise water conservancy funds through multiple channels and to run water conservancy thriftily. In the water conservancy construction last year and this year, everyone has been meticulous in their calculations, thinking of various ways to improve the efficiency of laborers. They try not to hire skilled workers as much as possible. They save on the cost of tools and equipment by using self-collected raw materials (such as burning their own lime, quarrying stones, felling trees, and processing local soil to replace cement), utilizing waste materials, and bringing their own homemade tools. For example, Xin'yu Township in Kunyang County used the above methods to build a small reservoir that can irrigate 4,000 mu at a cost of only 13,000 yuan. The county and township have also adopted methods such as clearing surplus funds from township administration and the remaining fruits of land reform, organizing income from public housing and water rents, and drawing on township-raised funds and cooperative public accumulation funds in a planned manner to open up various sources of revenue. Now, except for mountainous areas, small-scale water conservancy projects that irrigate less than 3,000 mu are generally run by the masses themselves. For medium-sized water conservancy projects, if the cooperatives are not strong enough, the state will provide appropriate subsidies in terms of equipment and raw materials.

Relying on the masses' own strength to run water conservancy also requires solving the problem of reasonable burdens. Initially, some places adopted the method of "large-scale labor exchange," which the masses regarded as corv√©e labor, leading to a lack of enthusiasm for labor and the belief that "it doesn't matter whether you work or not, it all counts as one workday," resulting in negative consequences such as late starts, early finishes, more smoking, and less work. After summarizing, the current method is generally to have cooperatives that directly and indirectly benefit bear the costs in proportion, and to carry out labor assistance in the form of "borrowing labor and returning labor," "borrowing work and returning work," or "borrowing work and returning money" between benefited and non-benefited areas. Within the cooperatives, labor quotas for water conservancy tasks are formulated by referring to agricultural production quotas, and a piece-rate system is implemented. Water conservancy work points are distributed in a unified manner with work points for regular agricultural labor (if too many water conservancy workdays are spent in the current year, and the distribution cannot guarantee increased income, a portion of the work points will be transferred to the next year for distribution). This not only improves labor efficiency and ensures project quality but also consolidates the enthusiasm of the masses for water conservancy construction.

(4) Properly arrange labor and carry out water conservancy construction throughout the year. In the past, the custom in Yunnan was to carry out water conservancy construction in the spring, which often led to a "riding a tiger" situation due to inadequate surveying and planning, either causing projects to be abandoned halfway or affecting the quality of spring plowing, resulting in a reduction in agricultural production that year. After several years of exploration, we have found the law of year-round surveying, year-round preparation, year-round construction, and winter assault. Each year, while formulating production plans and labor plans, the cooperatives also formulate water conservancy plans. In addition to concentrating on field labor during the spring plowing and autumn harvest seasons, they can allocate about 10%-15% of the labor force in winter and spring, and about 5%-8% in summer, to water conservancy construction, so as to ensure that both water conservancy construction and regular agricultural activities are not neglected. Many cooperatives have also organized year-round water conservancy engineering teams according to production plans and water conservancy plans, which are responsible for undertaking some major projects in normal times and become the backbone of construction in winter and spring.

(5) Teach technology to farmers and cultivate a mass water conservancy technical team. With the development of water conservancy construction, a certain amount of technical expertise is needed to ensure that water conservancy work continues to move forward. In the early days of liberation, there were only three water conservancy cadres in the entire region. In 1954, we had to ask the province to design a reservoir with a dam eight meters high, and the soil had to be sent to Chongqing and Beijing for testing, and we dared not start construction for a year or two. Over the past few years, with the help of higher authorities, we have adopted methods such as experienced workers teaching novices, masters taking apprentices, holding short-term training classes, on-site technical lectures, organizing visits, and studying abroad, integrating engineering tasks and construction plans with mass discussions, combining science and technology with the experience of farmers, and gradually cultivating a technical team of 60 technicians and 3,000 non-detached farmer water conservancy technicians and instructors. Water conservancy instructors in each county maintain close contact with farmer water conservancy technicians in each township to form a water conservancy technical guidance network. Of the 35 projects irrigating more than 3,000 mu that have been or are about to be constructed this year and next year, the dam height of which are all above 20 meters, 34 of them are responsible for surveying, designing, and controlling construction by the special district water conservancy work team; small-scale projects irrigating less than 3,000 mu are generally assisted by county water conservancy technicians in selecting terrain and controlling construction.

(6) The Party Committee personally leads and the whole Party runs water conservancy. Over the past few years, we have deeply realized that to carry out a large-scale mass water conservancy construction movement, there must be a relatively thorough plan, arduous ideological and organizational work must be carried out among the masses, and the strength of all parties must be organized to provide cooperation and support. It is not possible without the Party Committee taking action. In order to strengthen the specific leadership of water conservancy work, we have established water conservancy offices or water conservancy committees at the special district, county, district, and township levels. Counties generally have two to five county committee members in charge of water conservancy, led by one of the secretaries. In some counties, in order to launch a concentrated water conservancy construction effort in winter and spring, the county committee adopts the method of dividing work by district, the district committee dividing work by township, and the branch dividing work by cooperative, with each level contracting and being specifically responsible. From surveying and design to planning and construction, all are studied and arranged by the Party Committee. Larger projects are directly controlled by the Party Committee, thus gradually strengthening planning, overcoming blindness, and ensuring project quality. Many county, district, and township cadres eat and live with the masses in water conservancy work, leading the masses to climb mountains and wade through waters, looking for water sources, surveying terrain, and building dams together with farmers. Many branch secretaries and Party members personally lead workers to construction sites, directly inspiring the masses and strengthening the relationship between the Party and the people.

Although we have made some achievements in water conservancy construction over the past few years, there are many shortcomings. The most important is that we do not have a clear understanding of the natural conditions and water resources of the entire region, and we lack overall consideration and planning for upstream and downstream, water conservancy development and soil and water conservation, irrigation and flood control, and water storage and drainage. Water conservancy construction is very rushed, often only considering the present and not the long term, resulting in blindness and passivity, and a great deal of waste. In some places, we have even damaged national resources. This must be actively overcome.

Based on the existing data, we plan to build small- and medium-sized water conservancy projects that can irrigate 540,000 mu during the Second Five-Year Plan. After this plan is realized, the average annual yield of grain crops per mu in the entire region will reach 810 jin in 1962. We also plan to convert hundreds of thousands of mu of dry land into paddy fields, and the total grain output in the entire region will increase by 41.4% compared to the total grain output in 1957, with an average of 900 jin of grain per agricultural person.
