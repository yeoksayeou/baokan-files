Store Rainwater, Dig Out Spring Water, Pump Up Lake Water
Launch a Mass Water Conservancy Construction Movement
Yuxi Prefecture, Yunnan Province, Changes Its Decade-Long Predicament of Frequent Droughts

Yuxi Prefecture consists of twelve counties, with 2,020,000 mu of cultivated land, including 1,180,000 mu of paddy fields and 840,000 mu of dry land, and an agricultural population of 1,160,000.

The entire area has dozens of tributaries of three water systems: the Nanpan River, the Jinsha River, and the Red River, as well as five lakes of varying sizes, including Dianchi Lake and Fuxian Lake, with an average annual rainfall of about 1,000 millimeters. However, 80% of the rainfall is concentrated in the summer and autumn, with water shortages in winter and spring. Water resources are abundant, but water conservancy infrastructure is very backward. In 1950, only 200,000 mu of stable paddy fields had irrigation equipment. Most of the cultivated land relied on rainwater and perennial streams for irrigation. Near rivers and lakes, fights over water, even leading to deaths, occurred every year during rice transplanting season. In areas slightly farther from rivers and lakes, "nine out of ten years were drought years," forcing people to pray to gods and offer sacrifices, waiting for rain to plant rice. Farmers were long trapped in a state of poverty: "planting for three months, harvesting for three months, and eating for three months." After the land reform was basically completed in early 1953, some small-scale water conservancy projects were built every year. In early 1956, after the basic completion of advanced agricultural cooperatives, encouraged by the National Agricultural Development Program and under the specific guidance of the higher-level Party committees, we implemented the principle of "run by the people with government assistance" and launched an unprecedented mass water conservancy construction movement in the entire region. From the winter of 1956 to the spring of 1957 alone, 7,070,000 labor days of ordinary workers and 600,000 labor days of skilled workers were mobilized. In total, during the First Five-Year Plan, the region contributed 15,000,000 labor days, building more than 13,000 small- and medium-sized water conservancy projects (including 19 medium-sized projects capable of irrigating more than 3,000 mu), and installing 119 water pumps, ensuring that every county had a reservoir and every township had a dam or pond. As a result, the area of stable paddy fields in the region expanded to 800,000 mu, four times the pre-liberation level. In normal years, 80% of the paddy fields can be guaranteed to plant rice according to the season. It is estimated that this single measure will increase rice production by 70 jin per mu. Combined with other measures, it is projected that the average yield of rice per mu in the region will reach 628 jin in 1957, an increase of 35.9% compared to 1952 (462 jin per mu), a year of favorable weather. The total grain output is expected to increase by 41% compared to 1952, and the grain output per agricultural person will increase from 514 jin in 1952 to 718 jin.

Over the past few years, in mobilizing the masses and launching the water conservancy construction movement, we have had the following insights:

(1) Clarify that water conservancy is the center of agricultural basic construction and establish the idea of "demanding water from nature" among all farmers. In the winter of 1955, during the publicity and discussion of the National Agricultural Development Program, we calculated the water conservancy accounts among farmers and cadres throughout the region based on the guiding ideology of "water conservancy is the center of agricultural basic construction in our province" put forward by the Provincial Party Committee. We compared the different yields of dry land and paddy fields, dry land and irrigated land, "thunderstorm fields" (fields that can only be planted after heavy rains) and stable paddy fields. We used the fact that some areas had achieved significant production increases in the previous two years due to the construction of some water conservancy projects to educate and inspire the enthusiasm of the masses for water conservancy construction.

(2) Adapt to local conditions and develop water resources from all aspects. Through gradual exploration, we summarized the experiences of the masses based on the complex terrain and concentrated rainfall characteristics of Yunnan and proposed the slogan "Store rainwater, dig out spring water, and pump up lake water." We promoted small-scale projects as the mainstay, adapting to local conditions, using various forms, fully utilizing water resources, and leveraging the wisdom of the masses to create methods that cost little and yield quick results. In mountainous areas, we promoted "where land is reclaimed, water conservancy is built," "how high the fields are, how high the water must be," using methods such as digging ponds on hillsides, opening ditches along mountains, building dams to intercept water, and erecting flumes to carry water. In dam areas, we adopted methods such as building river dams, diverting river water, building terraced dams, and constructing reservoirs, adopting "long vine bearing melons" (combining ditch irrigation with dam and pond storage) to fully utilize river and lake water sources, which can both resist drought and prevent floods.

(3) Overcome the "government-run" mentality, implement the principle of "run by the people with government assistance," rely on the masses, and run water conservancy thriftily. Before cooperativization, water conservancy construction relied mostly on state investment or loans, which was necessary at the time. However, due to insufficient education, it fostered the idea among cadres and the masses that they should rely on the government to "officially run" water conservancy. As soon as construction started, they would reach out to higher authorities for money. Some farmers even believed that water conservancy construction was "helping the government with affairs, eating after the bell rings, and getting money after stamping the seal." As the water conservancy movement developed, more and more projects were built, and the construction costs increased. Under the pressure of objective circumstances, we have continuously reversed the "government-run" mentality of cadres and educated the masses to rely on their own strength to run water conservancy over the past two years. After advanced cooperativization, favorable conditions were created for running water conservancy for the people. This year, the earthwork for water conservancy projects is generally borne by the cooperatives. The wages of skilled workers, tools, and equipment, in addition to appropriate state subsidies, are also resolved by the cooperatives as much as possible. This has stimulated the enthusiasm of Party committees and cooperatives at all levels to raise water conservancy funds through multiple channels and to run water conservancy thriftily. In the water conservancy construction last year and this year, everyone has been meticulous in their calculations, thinking of various ways to improve the efficiency of laborers. They try not to hire skilled workers as much as possible. They save on the cost of tools and equipment by using self-collected raw materials (such as burning their own lime, quarrying stones, felling trees, and processing local soil to replace cement), utilizing waste materials, and bringing their own homemade tools. For example, Xin'yu Township in Kunyang County used the above methods to build a small reservoir that can irrigate 4,000 mu at a cost of only 13,000 yuan. The county and township have also adopted methods such as clearing surplus funds from township administration and the remaining fruits of land reform, organizing income from public housing and water rents, and drawing on township-raised funds and cooperative public accumulation funds in a planned manner to open up various sources of revenue. Now, except for mountainous areas, small-scale water conservancy projects that irrigate less than 3,000 mu are generally run by the masses themselves. For medium-sized water conservancy projects, if the cooperatives are not strong enough, the state will provide appropriate subsidies in terms of equipment and raw materials.

Relying on the masses' own strength to run water conservancy also requires solving the problem of reasonable burdens. Initially, some places adopted the method of "large-scale labor exchange," which the masses regarded as corvée labor, leading to a lack of enthusiasm for labor and the belief that "it doesn't matter whether you work or not, it all counts as one workday," resulting in negative consequences such as late starts, early finishes, more smoking, and less work. After summarizing, the current method is generally to have cooperatives that directly and indirectly benefit bear the costs in proportion, and to carry out labor assistance in the form of "borrowing labor and returning labor," "borrowing work and returning work," or "borrowing work and returning money" between benefited and non-benefited areas. Within the cooperatives, labor quotas for water conservancy tasks are formulated by referring to agricultural production quotas, and a piece-rate system is implemented. Water conservancy work points are distributed in a unified manner with work points for regular agricultural labor (if too many water conservancy workdays are spent in the current year, and the distribution cannot guarantee increased income, a portion of the work points will be transferred to the next year for distribution). This not only improves labor efficiency and ensures project quality but also consolidates the enthusiasm of the masses for water conservancy construction.

(4) Properly arrange labor and carry out water conservancy construction throughout the year. In the past, the custom in Yunnan was to carry out water conservancy construction in the spring, which often led to a "riding a tiger" situation due to inadequate surveying and planning, either causing projects to be abandoned halfway or affecting the quality of spring plowing, resulting in a reduction in agricultural production that year. After several years of exploration, we have found the law of year-round surveying, year-round preparation, year-round construction, and winter assault. Each year, while formulating production plans and labor plans, the cooperatives also formulate water conservancy plans. In addition to concentrating on field labor during the spring plowing and autumn harvest seasons, they can allocate about 10%-15% of the labor force in winter and spring, and about 5%-8% in summer, to water conservancy construction, so as to ensure that both water conservancy construction and regular agricultural activities are not neglected. Many cooperatives have also organized year-round water conservancy engineering teams according to production plans and water conservancy plans, which are responsible for undertaking some major projects in normal times and become the backbone of construction in winter and spring.

(5) Teach technology to farmers and cultivate a mass water conservancy technical team. With the development of water conservancy construction, a certain amount of technical expertise is needed to ensure that water conservancy work continues to move forward. In the early days of liberation, there were only three water conservancy cadres in the entire region. In 1954, we had to ask the province to design a reservoir with a dam eight meters high, and the soil had to be sent to Chongqing and Beijing for testing, and we dared not start construction for a year or two. Over the past few years, with the help of higher authorities, we have adopted methods such as experienced workers teaching novices, masters taking apprentices, holding short-term training classes, on-site technical lectures, organizing visits, and studying abroad, integrating engineering tasks and construction plans with mass discussions, combining science and technology with the experience of farmers, and gradually cultivating a technical team of 60 technicians and 3,000 non-detached farmer water conservancy technicians and instructors. Water conservancy instructors in each county maintain close contact with farmer water conservancy technicians in each township to form a water conservancy technical guidance network. Of the 35 projects irrigating more than 3,000 mu that have been or are about to be constructed this year and next year, the dam height of which are all above 20 meters, 34 of them are responsible for surveying, designing, and controlling construction by the special district water conservancy work team; small-scale projects irrigating less than 3,000 mu are generally assisted by county water conservancy technicians in selecting terrain and controlling construction.

(6) The Party Committee personally leads and the whole Party runs water conservancy. Over the past few years, we have deeply realized that to carry out a large-scale mass water conservancy construction movement, there must be a relatively thorough plan, arduous ideological and organizational work must be carried out among the masses, and the strength of all parties must be organized to provide cooperation and support. It is not possible without the Party Committee taking action. In order to strengthen the specific leadership of water conservancy work, we have established water conservancy offices or water conservancy committees at the special district, county, district, and township levels. Counties generally have two to five county committee members in charge of water conservancy, led by one of the secretaries. In some counties, in order to launch a concentrated water conservancy construction effort in winter and spring, the county committee adopts the method of dividing work by district, the district committee dividing work by township, and the branch dividing work by cooperative, with each level contracting and being specifically responsible. From surveying and design to planning and construction, all are studied and arranged by the Party Committee. Larger projects are directly controlled by the Party Committee, thus gradually strengthening planning, overcoming blindness, and ensuring project quality. Many county, district, and township cadres eat and live with the masses in water conservancy work, leading the masses to climb mountains and wade through waters, looking for water sources, surveying terrain, and building dams together with farmers. Many branch secretaries and Party members personally lead workers to construction sites, directly inspiring the masses and strengthening the relationship between the Party and the people.

Although we have made some achievements in water conservancy construction over the past few years, there are many shortcomings. The most important is that we do not have a clear understanding of the natural conditions and water resources of the entire region, and we lack overall consideration and planning for upstream and downstream, water conservancy development and soil and water conservation, irrigation and flood control, and water storage and drainage. Water conservancy construction is very rushed, often only considering the present and not the long term, resulting in blindness and passivity, and a great deal of waste. In some places, we have even damaged national resources. This must be actively overcome.

Based on the existing data, we plan to build small- and medium-sized water conservancy projects that can irrigate 540,000 mu during the Second Five-Year Plan. After this plan is realized, the average annual yield of grain crops per mu in the entire region will reach 810 jin in 1962. We also plan to convert hundreds of thousands of mu of dry land into paddy fields, and the total grain output in the entire region will increase by 41.4% compared to the total grain output in 1957, with an average of 900 jin of grain per agricultural person.

    把雨水蓄起来  把泉水挖出来  把湖水抽上来
    开展群众性的水利建设运动
    云南玉溪专区改变了十年九旱的困苦境况
    玉溪专区共十二个县，现有耕地二百零二万亩，其中水田一百一十八万亩，旱地八十四万亩，农业人口一百一十六万人。
    全区有南盘江、金沙江、红河等三个水系的数十条支流和滇池、抚仙湖等五个大小湖泊，平均年降雨量约一千公厘，但80％集中于夏秋两季，冬春缺水。水利资源是很丰富的，水利基础却很落后。1950年全区有灌溉设备的稳定水田仅二十万亩，大部耕地靠雨水和长流水灌溉。靠近河湖的地方，每年插秧时都发生争水械斗打死人的事件；距河湖稍远的地区，则“十年九旱”，只得求神祭鬼，等雨栽秧。农民长期处在“栽三个月，收三个月，吃三个月”的贫困状态。1953年初完成土改以后，每年都兴修了一些小型水利。1956年初基本完成高级合作化，在全国农业发展纲要的鼓舞下，在上级党委的具体指导下，我们贯彻“民办公助”的方针，在全区开展了史无前例的群众性的水利建设运动。仅1956年冬到1957年春，就出动民工七百零七万工日，技术工六十万工日。总计第一个五年计划中，全区共出工一千五百万工日，兴修了中小型水利工程一万三千多件（其中能灌溉三千亩以上的中型工程十九件），安装抽水机一百一十九部，做到了县县有水库，乡乡有坝塘。因此，全区稳定水田扩大到八十万亩，相当于解放前的四倍，80％稻田在一般年景下可以保证按节令栽稻，单这一项，估计每亩即可增产稻谷七十斤；加上其它措施，预计1957年全区稻谷每亩产量可达六百二十八斤，比风调雨顺的1952年（每亩四百六十二斤）增产35.9％。粮食总产量可比1952年增长41％，每一农业人口的粮食产量由1952年的五百一十四斤提高到七百一十八斤。
    几年来在发动群众，开展水利建设运动中，我们有以下几点体会：
    （一）明确水利是农业基本建设的中心，在全体农民中树立“向自然要水”的思想。1955年冬，在宣传讨论农业发展纲要中，我们根据省委提出的“水利是我省农业基本建设的中心”的指导思想，在全区农民和干部当中算了水利账，对比了旱地与水田，旱地与水浇地、雷响田（下大雨才能栽秧的田）与稳定水田的不同产量，用前两年因为兴修了一些水利而取得显著增产效果的一些事实，来教育和启发广大群众兴修水利的积极性。
    （二）因地制宜，从各方面开发水利资源。在逐步摸索中，我们根据云南地形复杂，雨量集中的特点，总结了群众的经验，提出“把雨水蓄起来，把泉水挖出来，把湖水抽上来”的口号，提倡以小型为主，因地制宜，运用多种形式，充分利用水利资源，发挥群众的智慧，创造了花钱少、收效快的办法。山区提倡“开荒开到那里，水利修到那里”“田有多高，水要多高”，用在山坡上挖塘，沿山开沟，拦阱打坝，架橺槽渡水等办法。在坝区采用打拦河坝，挖走河水，打梯式坝，修水库，采取“长藤结瓜”（沟渠引水与坝塘蓄水相结合）等办法，充分利用河湖水源，既可抗旱，又可防洪。
    （三）克服“官办”思想，贯彻“民办公助”的方针，依靠群众，勤俭办水利。合作化以前，兴修水利多靠国家投资或贷款，这在当时是必要的。但由于教育不够，助长了干部和群众依赖政府“官办”水利的思想，一动工就伸手向上级要钱；有的农民甚至认为修水利是“帮政府办事，敲钟吃饭，盖章拿钱”。随着水利运动的开展，越修越多，且越往后工程造价越大，在客观形势逼迫下，两年来我们不断扭转干部的“官办”思想，教育群众依靠自己的力量办水利。高级合作化以后，为民办水利创造了有利条件。今年兴修水利中土方工程一般由合作社负担，技术工人的工资、工具器材等除国家适当补助外，也尽量由合作社自己设法解决。这样就发挥了各级党委和合作社多方筹措水利经费和勤俭办水利的积极性。去年和今年兴修水利中，大家都精打细算，想各种办法提高民工工效；能不雇用技术工的就尽量不雇用；用自采原料（如自己烧石灰，打石头、伐树，自己加工火土，代替水泥等），利用废料，自带自制工具等办法，尽量节约工具器材开支。如昆阳县新于乡，用以上办法修了一个能灌溉四千亩的小水库，造价仅一万三千元。县和乡也采取了清理乡政节余经费和剩余的土改果实，组织公房、水租等收入，有计划地抽用乡自筹经费、合作社的公积金等办法，多方开辟财源。现在，除山区外，一般灌溉三千亩以下的小型水利工程，都由群众自办；中型水利，如果合作社力量不足，由国家在器材原料方面给予适当的补助。
    依靠群众自己的力量办水利，还必须解决合理负担的问题。开初，有些地方采取“大变工”的办法，群众认为是支差，劳动不积极，认为“反正干不干都算一个工”，产生了出工迟、收工早，吃烟多、做工少的不良后果。经过总结，现在一般采取直接受益与间接受益的合作社按比例负担，受益区对非受益区“借工还工”、“借方还方”或“借方还钱”等办法进行劳动互助。合作社内部则比照农业生产定额制定水利工种的劳动定额，推行包工制，实行水利工分与农业经常劳动的工分统一分配（如果当年水利出工过多，分配后不能保证增加收入，就移一部分工分到下年分配）。这样不仅可以提高劳动效率，保证工程质量，而且可以把群众兴修水利的积极性巩固起来。
    （四）妥善安排劳动力，贯串全年地进行水利建设。云南过去的习惯，修水利都在春季进行，往往由于勘测和计划不周，到春耕紧张时形成“骑虎难下”，不是使工程半途而废，就是影响春耕质量，招致当年农业减产。经过几年摸索，找到了常年勘测，常年准备，常年施工，冬季突击的规律。合作社每年在制定生产计划和劳动计划的同时，制定水利计划，除春耕和秋收季节集中力量进行田间劳动外，冬春两季可以拿出10％—15％，夏季5％—8％左右的劳动力修水利，以保证兴修水利和经常的农事活动两不误。许多合作社并根据生产计划和水利计划组织了常年水利工程队，包干负责，平时负责进行一些主要工程，冬春两季则成为施工的骨干。
    （五）将技术教给农民，培养群众性的水利技术队伍。随着水利建设的发展，需要有一定的技术力量才能保证水利工作继续前进。解放初期，全区只有水利干部三人，1954年，我们修一个坝高八公尺的水库，就得请省里设计，土壤要送到重庆、北京去化验，拖了一两年不敢施工。几年来我们在上级的帮助下采取老手教生手、师傅带徒弟、开办短期训练班、工地技术讲座、组织参观、留学等办法，将工程任务和施工计划交给群众讨论，使科学技术与农民的经验相结合，逐步培养了一支有六十名技术员和三千名不脱产的农民水利技术员和辅导员的技术队伍，各县水利辅导员同各乡农民水利技术员，保持密切联系，形成水利技术指导网。今年和明年已施工和即将施工的三十五件灌溉三千亩以上的工程，坝高都在二十公尺以上，有三十四件都由专区水利工作队负责勘测、设计和掌握施工；灌溉三千亩以下的小型工程，一般都由县的水利技术员协助农民水利技术员选择地形，掌握施工。
    （六）党委亲自领导，全党办水利。几年来，我们深刻地体会到：要开展一个大规模的群众性的水利建设运动，必须有较为周密的计划，必须对群众进行艰巨的思想工作和组织工作，还必须组织各方面的力量给予配合支持，党委不动手是不行的。为了加强水利工作的具体领导，我们在专、县、区、乡都建立了水利办公室或水利委员会，县一般有二—五个县委委员分管水利，由书记之一负责领导，有的县在冬春季节，为了突击修水利，采取县委分工包区，区委分工包乡，支部分工包社，层层包干，具体负责，从勘测设计到计划施工，都是党委研究布置，较大工程由党委直接掌握施工，因而能逐步加强计划性，克服盲目性，保证工程质量。不少县、区、乡干部在水利工作中与群众同吃、同住，带领群众爬山涉水，寻找水源，勘察地形，与农民一道挑水筑坝，许多支部书记和党员则亲自率领民工上工地，直接鼓舞了群众，密切了党与人民群众的关系。
    几年来，我们虽然在水利建设上取得一些成绩，但缺点是很多的，最主要的是对全区的自然条件和水利资源的底子摸得不清，对上游与下游，开发水利与水土保持、灌溉与防洪、蓄水与排涝方面缺乏通盘的考虑和规划；兴修水利中突击性很大，往往只顾眼前，不考虑长远，以致盲目被动，浪费很大，有的地方甚至破坏了国家的资源。这是必须努力克服的。
    根据现在已有的资料，我们计划在第二个五年计划内兴修可灌溉五十四万亩的中小型水利。这一计划实现后，1962年全区粮食作物平均每亩年产量可达八百一十斤，另计划将旱地变水稻几十万亩，全区粮食总产量将比1957年粮食总产量增长41.4％，农业人口每人平均可有粮食九百斤。
