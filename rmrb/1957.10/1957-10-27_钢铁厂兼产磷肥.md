    Steel Mill also Produces Phosphate Fertilizer
    The Hunan Provincial State-owned Lianyuan Steel Plant has commenced construction, with all projects expected to be completed successively in 1959.

    The Lianyuan Steel Plant is a combined enterprise, which will mainly produce light-weight channel steel, angle steel, round steel, flat steel and steel rails; at the same time, it will also utilize the slag remaining from alkaline converter steelmaking to produce Thomas phosphate fertilizer. This phosphate fertilizer has low cost and higher fertilizer efficiency than superphosphate, and has a wide range of adaptability to southern crops. The blast furnace slag from the plant's iron smelting will also be used to produce non-clinker slag cement. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    钢铁厂兼产磷肥
    湖南省地方国营涟源钢铁厂动工兴建，全部工程预计在1959年内先后建成。
    涟源钢铁厂是一座联合企业，将来以生产轻型的各类槽钢、角钢、圆钢、扁钢和钢轨为主；同时还将利用碱性转炉炼钢剩下的炉渣生产脱马司磷肥。这种磷肥成本低，肥效比过磷酸钙大，对南方农作物具有广泛的适应性。这个厂炼铁高炉的炉渣也将用以生产无熟料炉渣水泥。　（据新华社讯）
