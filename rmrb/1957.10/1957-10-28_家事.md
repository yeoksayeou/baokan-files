    Household Matters
    △ If clothes are stained with blood, they can be washed clean without leaving any trace. The method is to soak the stained area in cold water for two or three minutes, then gently rub it with your hands. It can be washed off. Never use hot water and soap right away, as this will leave reddish-yellow stains on the clothes.
    What is the principle? This is because: The color of blood is made up of hemoglobin inside red blood cells. Hemoglobin is soluble in water, but it is a protein that coagulates when it comes into contact with hot water, so only cold water can wash it away. (Gui Mu)
    △ When using yeast to leaven dough in cold weather, adding a little white sugar can shorten the fermentation time and improve the effect.
    △ Adding a little sesame oil to bottled soy sauce can prevent white mold from growing.
    △ A new nib on a fountain pen may not easily attract ink when first used. If you lightly burn it with fire, it will not leak ink.
    △ When polishing leather shoes, adding one or two drops of vinegar to the shoe polish can make the shine on the leather shoes brighter and more lasting.
    △ Dirt in glass bottles is often difficult to wash away. If you put some crushed eggshells in the bottle, add water, and shake, it will scrape away the dirt and polish the bottle.
    △ Glass cups of uneven thickness are prone to cracking when filled with boiling water. If you put a metal object, such as a copper fork or copper spoon, in the cup before each time you pour boiling water, it will not crack.

    家事
    △衣服沾上了血污，能够把它洗得干干净净，丝毫不留痕迹。方法是把有血污的地方浸在凉水内，过两三分钟后用手轻轻的搓，就可以把它洗掉。千万不要一下子就用热水和肥皂来洗，这样会在衣服上留下红黄色的斑痕。
    原理何在呢？这是因为：血的颜色是由红血球内的血红蛋白构成的。血红蛋白能够溶解于水，但它是一种蛋白质，碰到热水时就凝固了，所以只有凉水能洗掉它。　（圭木）
    △冷天用发酵粉发面粉，加一点白糖，可以缩短发酵时间，而且效果更好。
    △在瓶装酱油中加少许麻油，可以不生白霉。
    △钢笔上的新笔尖，初用时不容易黏住墨水，如果用火略略烧一下，就可以不漏水了。
    △在擦皮鞋时，皮鞋油中加入一二滴醋，可以使皮鞋上的光彩更鲜明，更持久。
    △玻璃瓶中的污秽常常不易洗去，如果放一点碎蛋壳在瓶里，加水摇搅，就能刮垢磨光。
    △厚薄不匀的玻璃杯，冲开水时容易破裂，如果每次冲开水时在杯中先放上一金属器物，如铜叉、铜匙等，就不会破裂了。
