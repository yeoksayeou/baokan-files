Xinhua News Agency, New York, 5th: Syrian Foreign Minister Bitahr once again accused Western countries on the 4th of plotting to interfere in Syria's internal affairs.

Bitahr said at a banquet held by the United Nations Correspondents Association that officials of certain Western governments are currently launching a campaign to slander Syria. These governments are exerting political, diplomatic, and economic pressure on Syria. However, Syria rejects any outside interference in Syria's internal affairs and is trying to prevent certain Western countries from establishing or expanding their spheres of influence in the Middle East through pressure, threats, and blackmail.

Bitahr said that Arab countries are striving to oppose the concept that they can only enjoy security after they accept the "protection" of this or that great power. They believe that the fundamental reason for the crises that shroud today's Middle East situation undoubtedly lies in the firm unwillingness of certain Western countries to accept the inevitable evolution of Arab countries that have now shed the shackles of Western imperialism and want to live independently and freely. Therefore, great powers must forever abandon the old tactics of imperialism and forever abandon the use of pressure, threats, and any form of aggression, so that the ideal situation of international relations based on the principles of the United Nations can be realized.

Bitahr refuted the slanderous remarks that Syria has become an "arsenal of Soviet weapons." He said: Syria has the right to build its own defense to deal with the danger of real aggression.

He also said that Syria cannot accept American "aid" because the United States provides weapons or economic "aid" with political conditions attached.

When asked if he planned to meet with US Secretary of State Dulles, Bitahr said that he would decide on this issue in the coming days. He said that Syria will pursue any actions that lead to reconciliation and understanding, but the United States has not issued him any invitation to meet Dulles.

Xinhua News Agency, New York, 5th: Saudi Arabia's representative to the United Nations, Shukeiry, emphasized to reporters on the 4th that his speech at the UN General Assembly on the 2nd criticizing Western attempts to interfere in Syria's internal affairs "was speaking as a representative of his government. His speech reflected the policy of the Saudi Arabian government."

A senior official of the Saudi Arabian delegation also said: "It can be clearly stated that everything Mr. Shukeiry said to the General Assembly is completely in line with the policy of the Saudi Arabian government."

Shukeiry's remarks to reporters refuted the nonsense of the US State Department that his speech at the UN did not seem to represent the views of the Saudi Arabian government. It is reported that since Shukeiry's speech at the UN General Assembly, US officials have felt "very uneasy," and these officials have publicly expressed "regret" over the speech because it supported Syria and did not believe that the West had any right to interfere in Syria. The news said that the US government suspected that Shukeiry's speech did not reflect the views of the King of Saudi Arabia and therefore instructed its embassy in Jeddah to try to obtain a "clarification" of Shukeiry's speech.

At the same time, American newspapers are also uneasy about Shukeiry's speech and continue to step up anti-Syrian hostile propaganda. "New York Post" reporter Rashi sent a message from the United Nations headquarters saying that, according to the views of many diplomats, the Saudi Arabian representative's speech meant "the bankruptcy of the Eisenhower Doctrine." "The New York Times" said that Shukeiry's speech more clearly repeated what the King of Saudi Arabia and other Arab leaders had said at the Damascus conference.

    叙外长指斥西方国家造成中东危机
    表示叙利亚有权建立国防对付侵略

    新华社5日讯　纽约消息：叙利亚外交部长比塔尔4日再次指责西方国家阴谋干涉叙利亚内政。
    比塔尔在联合国记者协会举行的一个宴会上说，某些西方政府的官方人士目前正在发动诽谤叙利亚的运动。这些政府对叙利亚施加政治、外交和经济的压力。但是叙利亚拒绝外界对叙利亚内政的任何干涉，并且正在设法阻止某些西方国家希望通过压力、威胁和讹诈在中东地区建立或者扩张势力范围。
    比塔尔说，阿拉伯世界各国竭力反对这种概念：除非等到它们接受这个或那个大国的“保护”后才能享有安全。它们认为，笼罩今天中东局势的那些危机的基本原因无疑在于，某些西方国家坚决不愿意接受现在已经摆脱西方帝国主义枷锁而想独立和自由地生活的阿拉伯国家的无可避免的演变。因此大国必须永远放弃帝国主义的陈旧策略，永远放弃使用压力、威胁和任何形式的侵略的方法，这样才可以实现以联合国原则为基础的国际关系的理想局面。
    比塔尔驳斥了所谓叙利亚已经变成“苏联武器的军械库”这种诽谤言论。他说：叙利亚有权建立自己的国防，用以对付真正侵略的危险。
    他还说，叙利亚不能接受美国的“援助”，因为美国提供武器或者经济“援助”附有政治条件。
    谈到他是否打算同美国国务卿杜勒斯会谈的问题，比塔尔说，关于这个问题，他将在今后数日内决定。他说，叙利亚将追随导致和解和谅解的任何行动，然而美国并没有向他发出会见杜勒斯的任何邀请。
    据新华社5日讯　纽约消息：沙特阿拉伯驻联合国代表舒凯里4日对记者强调说，他2日在联合国大会上发言抨击西方企图干涉叙利亚内政，“是作为他的政府的代表发言的。他的发言反映了沙特阿拉伯政府的政策。”
    沙特阿拉伯代表团的一个高级官员也说：“可以明确地说，舒凯里先生向大会所讲的一切是完全符合于沙特阿拉伯政府的政策的。”
    舒凯里对记者的谈话驳斥了美国国务院这种胡说，就是他在联大的发言似乎并不代表沙特阿拉伯政府的意见。据报道，自从舒凯里在联合国大会上发言后，美国官员感到“非常不安”，这些官员对这个发言公开表示“遗憾”，因为这个发言支持了叙利亚，并且不认为西方有任何干涉叙利亚的权利。消息说，美国政府怀疑舒凯里的发言并不是反映沙特阿拉伯国王的意见，并且为此训令它驻吉达的大使馆设法得到对舒凯里的发言的“澄清”。
    同时，美国报纸也对舒凯里的发言感到不安，并且继续加紧反叙利亚的敌意宣传。“纽约邮报”记者拉希从联合国总部发出的消息说，根据许多外交人士的看法，沙特阿拉伯代表的发言意味着“艾森豪威尔主义的破产”。“纽约时报”说，舒凯里的发言更明显地重复了沙特国王及其他阿拉伯领袖在大马士革会议上说过的话。
