    Let's All Do the Third Set of Broadcast Exercises
    Li Menghua, Director of the Sports Department of the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission

    Broadcast exercises are the most widespread mass sports activity. Since the first set of broadcast exercises was published in 1951, the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission has successively compiled and published the first set of children's and youth broadcast exercises, and the second set of children's, youth, and adult broadcast exercises, as well as four sets of men's and women's labor protection exercises. These exercises have been welcomed by workers, soldiers, students, and government cadres. Broadcast exercises have been widely carried out throughout the country, and the number of participants has increased year by year. This has played a great role in popularizing sports and promoting human health, thereby achieving good results in improving production, work, and study efficiency.

    In order to further develop mass sports activities and meet the public's demand for broadcast exercises, the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission has compiled the third set of children's, youth, and adult broadcast exercises. These three sets of exercises are still divided into eight sections according to the main parts of the human body such as limbs and trunk. They adopt easy-to-learn and easy-to-do movements, pay attention to the exercise of all parts of the body and its actual effects, and are suitable for the general public to do.

    The third set of exercises appropriately increases the amount of exercise compared to the first and second sets of broadcast exercises. The adult exercises also incorporate some movements from Chinese folk martial arts. Another feature of the third set of broadcast exercises is that leg activities are more and greater than the previous two sets of exercises. For example, the horse stance squat in the second section of squatting exercises, where the upper body remains upright and the legs are bent and squatting; the leg extension posture in the seventh section of whole body exercises, where the upper body rapidly shifts from the front leg supporting the entire body weight to the rear leg. These movements can effectively perform the activities of the lower limb ankle, knee, and hip joints and muscles. Therefore, it has a better exercise effect for people who lack lower limb activity.

    When promoting the new exercises in various places, it is best to first train the leaders, explain and demonstrate the key points of each exercise, the purpose of exercise, and the correct posture to everyone, and conduct decomposed movement exercises, and then connect the entire set of movements. This set of exercises can be done as morning exercises, work break exercises, and pre-work and post-work exercises. Individuals can do it alone or the whole team can do it. Physical laborers or mental laborers can do it once or more depending on their individual physical fitness. When carrying out the third set of broadcast exercises, various places can also adopt methods such as "teaching stations" and "short-term training classes" to further carry out broadcast exercise activities in depth.

    大家来做第三套广播操
    国家体委运动司司长　李梦华
    广播体操运动，是一项最广泛的群众体育活动。自从1951年第一套广播体操公布以后，几年来，国家体委又先后编制、公布了第一套儿童、少年和第二套儿童、少年、成人广播体操，四套男女劳卫操。这些体操受到了工人、战士、学生、机关干部的欢迎。广播体操在全国范围内已经广泛开展，参加作操的人数逐年增加，这对普及体育运动、促进人体健康起了很大的作用；从而对提高生产、工作和学习效率也收到了良好的效果。
    国家体委为了进一步开展群众性的体育运动，满足群众对广播体操的要求，又编制了第三套儿童、少年、成人广播体操。这三套体操仍按人体的四肢和躯干等主要部位分为八节，采取易学易作的动作，注意到全身各部位的锻炼及其实际效果，适合广大群众来做。
    第三套操比第一、二套广播体操适当地增大了运动量，成人体操并吸取了我国民间武术的一些动作。第三套广播体操的另一个特点是腿部活动比前两套操更多、更大些。例如第二节下蹲运动中的骑马蹲裆姿式，上体保持正直，两腿弯曲下蹲；第七节全身运动中的铺腿姿式，上体由前腿支持全身重量急速移到后腿，这些动作都能有效地进行下肢踝，膝髋的关节和肌肉的活动。因之，对于缺少下肢活动的人，有着更好的锻炼作用。
    各地在推广新操的时候，最好先训练领操员，把每节操的动作要领、锻炼目的和正确姿式，给大家讲解示范，进行分解动作练习，然后再连贯全套动作。这套操可以作早操、工间操和工前、工后体操，个人单独作或整队的做都可以，体力劳动者或脑力劳动者可以根据个人体质强弱做一遍或两遍以上。在开展第三套广播体操时，各地并可吸取“传授站”、“短训班”等办法，进一步深入开展广播体操活动。
