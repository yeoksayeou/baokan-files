The Shadow of Capitalist Economic Crisis is Rising

Since the beginning of this year, American industrial production has stagnated and shown instability. This situation has caused anxiety both within the United States and in the rest of the capitalist world. Here we excerpt some comments from American and British newspapers in September expressing serious concern about the development trends of the American economy.

The London "Financial Times" published an article on September 3 entitled "American Outlook—Will There Be an Improvement This Autumn?" The author is American economist Paul Samuelson. The article said:

This spring, I pointed out that the American economy was in a state of "stillness." Since then, this "stillness" has shown a slight downward trend. The production index reached a peak of 147 last December, but fell to 143 in April and May, and the latest July figure remained at 144. Steel production only reaches 80% of its capacity. The automobile industry is not doing well in 1957 and can only wait until next year, hoping for an improvement with the release of the 1958 models (cars).

Consumer spending on many durable goods has disappointed manufacturers. Total consumption remains high. The reduction in people's disposable income used for consumption is less than 7%. ... Inventory increased very rapidly in the second half of 1956. There was a slight decrease in the first quarter of this year. The decline in the production index is clearly related to this... After seasonal adjustment, the annual rate of inventory accumulation in the second quarter was $2 billion. Observers have different interpretations of this phenomenon.

Some people are relieved, rejoicing that inventory accumulation has not increased to the point of a slow recession. Others, such as the First National City Bank of New York... point out that there is reason to be uneasy about the renewed increase in inventory... because this increase in inventory is by no means voluntary—it is formed by sluggish sales, not by merchants wanting to increase their stock.

What conclusions do economists in American business and government draw about the future? Opinions are more divided than usual. It is fair to say so. You will find some economists predicting a mild recession in late 1957 and early 1958. And the recent weakness shown by Wall Street shows that investors agree with this analysis...

The American "Newsweek" published an article on September 16 entitled "Consumer Sentiment—Cautious," discussing the anxiety of American economists about the American economic outlook, saying:

Last week, a Wall Street investor asked his broker, "What are they saying about the country's economic prospects?"

"It's funny," said the broker, who had just returned from traveling extensively, "everywhere I go, people ask me: 'What are the people on Wall Street saying?'"

This brief conversation illustrates the instability that has emerged in many sectors of American business in recent weeks.

In July, business people were still talking excitedly about a record-breaking rise in the fourth quarter of 1957. But now, although managers across the country remain optimistic, this optimism is waning. ... A small number even expect a decline in early 1958. Fluctuations in the stock market reflect all this instability. There, in two months, 64% of the (stock price) increase from February to July was wiped out. ...

What troubles many business people the most is that when they look to the future, they cannot see where the next big stimulus for business will come from...

All (business) experts are watching consumers; especially to see their reaction to the 1958 models of the automobile industry. ... Some automakers are watching how dealers clear their large stocks of 1957 models (currently 800,000 vehicles, compared to 500,000 a year ago). ... And how car buyers will react to the average price increase of $100 for new cars is one of the two major issues that car dealers are currently considering...

The British weekly "The Economist" published a Washington dispatch on September 7, entitled "Deflation at High Level." The dispatch said:

The concern about recession that currently plagues a considerable number of economists, business owners, and stock market investors seems to have more reliable economic evidence than those that appear every six months for the past two years. Based on estimates of various factors in aggregate demand, it appears that none (demand) will rise, and one or two important items will certainly decline. The most important and certain change is that the annual rate of defense spending will fall from 41.5 billion this spring to 38 billion in the first quarter of next year. ... Forecasters cannot see anything that can compensate for this decline... The boom in capital investment has stopped rising, which is now quite clear. The only question is whether the annual rate of $37 billion reached in the April-June quarter (capital investment) can be maintained or will decline slightly in the remaining period of this year. Housing activity has stopped falling, but no one expects much stimulus effect, at least within 6 months, after the government's recent easing of mortgage insurance conditions. ... The last place people are pinning their hopes on is the purchase of inventory by manufacturing and commerce; ... However, although the entire economy is under rampant inflation, industry has not increased its inventory.

What remains are only government spending other than defense and consumer spending... Due to the current thrift campaign, the federal government's purchases of goods and services for non-defense purposes... can at most only maintain the level of the first six months of 1957. As for consumers, that, as usual, remains a question. Although their income is rising... consumers' purchases, after removing the factor of price increases, did not increase in the second quarter compared to the first quarter. ...

The British "Times" published an editorial on September 11 entitled "America's Sneeze." It said:

“No country can escape the consequences of any health imbalances in the American economy. As the saying goes, when America sneezes, the rest of the world catches pneumonia. Such an imbalance is currently believed to be developing. This is beginning to cause anxiety not only in the United States but also around the world. The obvious signs are: in the past seven or eight months, American industrial activity has not continued to expand (although it has not actually shrunk), and at the same time, since July, (stock) prices on Wall Street have fallen sharply. One of the main impacts on the outside world is that American demand for raw materials has stopped. This in itself certainly has a certain impact on the weakness of raw material prices in the past six months. In some cases, this type of development is not just a matter of price drops; for example, the price of copper has fallen by one-third in the past year, which has caused a great loss in income for some raw material producing countries, such as the Central African Federation.

Since the spring of this year, American business people and economic commentators have considered the stagnation of summer business activity to be unimportant and pinned their hopes on a new rise in the autumn. Now they are anxious because there are no signs that the peak season for economic activity has begun in the autumn. Various factors have been analyzed in detail. Although the purchasing situation of ordinary consumers is still not bad, housing construction has not improved. At the same time, the contraction of general industry, especially the transportation industry, has had an adverse impact on orders for new fixed capital equipment. ... The most ominous sign is that the order books held by industrial enterprises have been greatly reduced. Many industries are manufacturing far more products than the orders they receive. It is generally felt that this situation cannot last if production is not cut. At present, the hope for an autumn recovery mainly rests on the automobile industry, which plays a decisive role in the American economy. In fact, it is entirely possible for the automobile industry to play a stimulating role. But confidence in its ability to achieve a recovery has weakened. ... Unless some new trends emerge, it is only natural that there is a certain degree of anxiety in the United States and abroad."

"U.S. News & World Report" published an article on September 20 entitled "Business Around the World," with the following summary:

People abroad are becoming increasingly uneasy about the state of American business. As people across the Atlantic see it, the various trends in the United States do not seem very promising.

America's "stagnant production" is deeply worrying the British. Many Europeans believe that American prosperity is over. Weaknesses are beginning to appear.

Europeans fear that if an American recession occurs, it will have a much more serious impact abroad than in 1953-1954.

More and more people abroad feel that if the American economy declines in the coming months, it will unfortunately happen precisely when a general slowdown is occurring in many other places.

Some foreigners are beginning to worry that the decline in the American economy will cause a chain reaction. All the factors that cause difficulties are coming together.

Other countries are heavily depleting their gold and dollar reserves to pay off their debts to American exporters. The American trade surplus is gradually becoming a problem.

Due to the lack of dollars in various countries, coupled with the decreasing demand for American agricultural products and coal, American exports will be increasingly affected in the coming months.

The increase in American imports this year is not very large. However, now that prosperity has a sign of declining, American industries harmed by imports are complaining louder and louder. These voices come from the domestic non-ferrous metal mining industry, the domestic oil industry, and other industries. There is currently a surplus of metals and oil worldwide.

In terms of currency, unease continues...

The Canadian dollar has had a sudden and sharp drop. The Dutch guilder is unstable. The pound sterling is not too strong either.

The recovery of the German mark is also becoming increasingly unlikely.

Even after the turmoil caused by speculation in European currencies calms down, the underlying problem will persist. Germany, as a major creditor within Europe, is still drawing an uncomfortably large amount of currency from its neighbors. The United States, which has a large trade surplus with Europe, is also constantly sucking large amounts of dollars and gold from the treasuries of European countries. This two-pronged attack worries the governments of most European countries.

### 资本主义经济危机的阴云在上升中

专栏：外论摘要

    资本主义经济危机的阴云在上升中
    今年以来美国工业生产停滞不前并呈现不稳状态。这种情况已经在美国国内和资本主义世界其余地区引起不安。这里我们摘录了9月份美英报刊上对美国经济发展趋势表示严重耽心的一部分评论。
    9月3日伦敦“金融时报”发表了题为“美国展望——今秋是否会有起色”的文章。作者是美国经济学家保尔·塞缪尔森。文章说：
    今春我曾指出，美国经济处于“静止”状态。此后，这种“静止”状态已呈现微微下降趋势。生产指数去年12月达到最高峰一百四十七，而在4、5月又下降到一百四十三，最近7月的数字则保持在一百四十四。钢的生产只达到生产力的80％。汽车工业在1957年不大好，只好坐待来年，希望1958年式样（汽车）一出会有起色。
    许多耐用品的消费使制造商很失望。总的消费量仍旧很高。人们可以自由支配的收入用于消费方面的减少了不到7％。……1956年下半年时存货的增加非常迅速。今年第一季微有减少。生产指数的下降显然同这点有关。……经过季度调整，第二季度存货的积累的年率是二十亿美元。观察家们在解释这一现象时出现了分歧。
    有些人放了心，庆幸存货的积累没有增加到缓慢衰退的程度。另外一些人，如纽约第一花旗银行……则指出，人们有理由因存货的重新增加而不安，……因为这次存货增加的情况决不是自愿的——是由滞销形成的，而不是由商人想增加货底。
    美国企业界和政府中的经济学者对前途作出什么结论呢？意见分歧比平常更大。这样说是公正的。你会发现有一些经济学者预料，1957年后期和1958年初期会有温和的衰退。而最近华尔街所表现的弱点说明投资者同意这样的分析……。
    9月16日的美国“新闻周刊”以“消费者的心情——小心翼翼”为题发表文章，论述美国经济界人士对美国经济前景不安的心情说：
    上周，有一个华尔街的投资者问他的经纪人：“他们在怎样谈论国家的经济前景？”
    “真有趣，”这个新近跑过很多地方才回来的经纪人说：“不管到那里，人们总是问我：‘华尔街的人们是怎样说法’？”
    这个简短的谈话说明了最近几周来在美国企业中很多部门出现的不稳定现象。
    在7月份的时候，企业界人士还到处在兴高采烈地谈论1957年第四季度的破纪录上升。但是现在，虽则全国各地的经理人员仍然抱着乐观态度，但是这种乐观情绪已在减退。……一小部分人甚至预期1958年初会有一次下降。证券市场的波动就反映了所有这种不稳定状态。那里在两个月内就把从2月到7月（股票价格）上涨的数字抹掉了64％。………
    使许多企业界人士最苦恼的是，当他们展望将来时，看不见从那里会出现下一个对商业的大刺激……。
    所有的（商业）专家们都在注视着消费者；特别是在看他们对汽车业的1958年型汽车的反应。……一些汽车制造商在观望那些经销商怎样把他们大量存积的1957年型汽车（目前是八十万辆，一年前是五十万辆）出清。……而买汽车的人对新汽车平均涨价一百美元的事将怎样反应，是汽车商们目前所考虑的两个大问题之一……。
    9月7日英国“经济学家”周刊发表了一篇华盛顿通讯，题为“在高度水平的通货紧缩”。通讯说：
    目前使相当多的经济学者、企业主和证券市场的投资人为之困恼的对衰退的担心，似乎比两年来每隔六个月就会出现的那些担心，具有更可靠的经济证据。依据对总的需求中的各种因素的估计，似乎没有哪一项（需求）将会上升，而有一、两个重要项目还肯定会下降。最重要的和可以肯定的一个变化就是国防费用开支的年率将由今年春天的四百一十五亿下降到明年第一季度的三百八十亿。……预测家还看不到任何可以弥补这一下降……的东西。资本投资的繁荣已经停止上升，这点现在已变得十分清楚。唯一的问题是，在4月到6月这个季度中（资本投资）所达到的三百七十亿美元的年率在今年下剩的时期中能否保持还是会轻微下降。房屋活动已经停止下跌，但是没有人期望最近在政府放宽抵押保险条件后，至少在6个月内会有多么大的刺激效果。……人们最后所寄托的地方只剩下制造业和商业的购进存货；……可是虽然整个经济是处于蔓延的通货膨胀下，工业却没有增加它的存货。
    剩下来的就只有政府的国防费以外的开支和消费者支出……。由于目前的节约运动，联邦政府用于非国防目的的货物和劳务的购进……最多也只能维持1957年头六个月的水平。至于消费者，那正和通常一样，仍是一个疑问。尽管他们的收入在上升……但是消费者的购买量，在除去价格上涨因素以后，第二季比第一季并没有什么增加。……
    9月11日英国“泰晤士报”以“美国的喷嚏”为题发表社论。其中说：
    “没有一个国家能够躲过美国经济在健康方面的任何一点失调所引起的后果。俗话说得好，当美国打喷嚏的时候，世界其余部分就要害肺炎了。目前这样一种失调正被认为是在发展。这件事不仅是在美国、而且在世界各地也开始引起焦虑。显明的征候就是：在过去七、八个月中美国的工业活动已不能继续扩大（虽然实际也没有缩减），同时从7月起华尔街的（股票）价格有了很厉害的下跌。对于外界的一个主要影响就是，美国对原料的需求停止了。这件事本身对于半年来原料价格的疲软当然起一定的影响。在某些情况下，这类发展还不仅是价格下跌的问题，譬如一年以来铜价跌落三分之一，就使一些出产原料的国家，如中非联邦，在收入上受到很大损失。
    从今年春天起，美国商业界人士和经济评论员曾经认为夏季商业活动的停滞无关重要，而把他们的信心寄托在秋季会出现新的上升方面。现在他们焦虑不安，因为没有任何征兆表明秋季开始了经济活动的旺季。各种因素都已被详尽无遗地分析过了。普通消费者购买的情况固然还不坏，但是住房建筑没有起色。同时一般工业，特别是运输工业的减缩，已有对新的固定资本设备的订货产生不利影响的征象。……最不祥的征候是工业企业所保有的订货单大大减少了。很多工业在制造着远比它们所收到的订货单为多的产品。一般感到，如果不削减生产，这种情况是不能持久的。目前秋季复苏的希望主要寄托在对美国经济起决定作用的汽车工业上。事实上汽车工业起一下刺激作用，是完全可能的。但是对于它是否能做到复苏，信心已经削弱了。……除非有某些新趋向出现，在美国和国外出现一定程度的焦虑，是很自然的。”
    9月20日的“美国新闻与世界报道”发表了题为“世界各地企业情况”一文，内容摘要如下：
    国外的人们对美国企业情况愈来愈感到不安。照大西洋彼岸的人们看来，美国的各种趋势看来不是很有希望。
    美国“静止的生产”使英国人深为担心。许多欧洲人都认为，美国的繁荣不行了。弱点开始呈现出来了。
    欧洲人担心，美国的衰退如果发生的话，会在国外产生比1953—1954年严重得多的影响。
    国外愈来愈多的人感觉到，如果未来的几个月中美国经济衰退，那不幸地恰恰发生在许多别的地方发生普遍迟滞的现象的时候。
    某些外国人士开始担心的是，美国经济的衰退会引起一种连锁反应。一切造成困难的因素都凑在一起了。
    其他国家正在为偿付它们对美国出口商的欠款而大量消耗黄金和美元储备。美国的出超逐渐成了一个问题了。
    由于各国缺乏美元，加上对美国农产品和煤的需要量正在减少，未来几个月间美国的出口将受到愈来愈深刻的影响。
    美国输入量今年的增加不是很多的。但是，既然繁荣已经有衰落的样子，受到进口的损害的美国工业愈来愈大声叫苦了。这些声音来自国内有色金属开采业、国内石油工业和其它工业。目前全世界的金属和石油是过剩的。
    在通货方面，不安的心情在继续着………
    加拿大元有了突然的、猛烈的下跌。荷兰盾是不稳定的。英镑也并不太坚强。
    德国马克的回升也愈来愈像是不可能的。
    即使在欧洲货币由于投机而产生的混乱局面平静下去以后，基本的问题仍旧继续存在。作为欧洲内部的大债权国的德国，仍旧在从它的邻国吸取着数量多得令人难堪的货币。同欧洲有大量贸易顺差的美国也在不断地从欧洲国家的财库里吮吸着大批的美元和黄金。这种两面夹攻使大多数欧洲国家的政府感到不安。
