It will lead our world trade union movement to a new stage of greater victory. He expressed his belief that international trade union organizations and independent trade unions of various tendencies will eventually unite to carry out a common struggle against the exploitation and oppression of monopoly capitalists and for the complete liberation of workers. He called on trade unions of all countries to take responsibility and use all possible means to help the WFTU carry out the international working-class solidarity and unity movement, and to continuously push history towards socialism, which has already proven to be superior to any other system.

The congress closed in warm cheers, enthusiastic applause, and the singing of the Internationale.
