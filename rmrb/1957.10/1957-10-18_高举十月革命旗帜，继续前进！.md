Hold High the Banner of the October Revolution and Continue to Advance!
Shen Junru, Chairman of the China Democratic League

　　The salvo of the October Revolution shook the world and opened a new era in human history. Although the October Revolution is only forty years old, its revolutionary influence has spread all over the globe. Now the entire human race is in this new era, entering an increasingly bright and happy world.

　　All national and people's revolutionary movements in the past forty years have been a continuation of the October Revolution, and the Chinese revolution is even more inseparable from the October Revolution. The Chinese people suffered defeat in the Opium War in 1840 and began to search for the truth that could free them from colonial oppression and make the country prosperous. After a long period of more than seventy years, it was not until 1917, under the inspiration of the October Revolution and the introduction of the Russians, that they found Marxism-Leninism. Since then, the advanced elements of China, like the advanced elements of all countries in the world, have learned to use the proletarian world outlook to reconsider the problems of their own country, and finally came to the correct conclusion—to take the road of the Russians, which is the road of the October Revolution.

　　Once the truth was found, our revolutionary movement unfolded rapidly. In 1921, the Chinese people had their own vanguard of the working class—the Communist Party of China. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese people, after twenty-eight years of struggle, achieved complete victory in the anti-imperialist, anti-feudal, and anti-bureaucratic-capitalist democratic revolution, established the People's Republic of China, a people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class and based on a worker-peasant alliance; and after eight years of struggle to this day, have transformed a semi-feudal and semi-colonial China into a socialist country. On the economic front, we have basically completed the socialist revolution, and the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts has also achieved initial but decisive victories. In the cause of socialist construction, we will also overfulfill the first five-year plan for the development of the national economy by the end of this year. It is expected that in another two or three five-year plans, our country will become a socialist industrialized power worthy of the name.

　　In the short span of forty years since the October Revolution, a friendly family of socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union has emerged in the world. This family has more than one-third of the world's population, geographically connected land accounting for more than one-quarter of the globe, and industrial production accounting for about one-third of the world's total industrial output value. Forty years of experience tells us that this family will continue to develop and expand in the future. It is the sun and hope for the unliberated people of the world, and naturally a fatal blow to imperialism.

　　In the past forty years, the Soviet people, under the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, have achieved extremely brilliant achievements in defending and developing the fruits of the October Revolution and in carrying out socialist construction. At present, the Soviet Union has caught up with and surpassed the United States in many major projects. Recently, in a series of important scientific inventions, the Soviet Union has been at the forefront of the world, making the capitalist countries, which boast of being industrially advanced, lag far behind. For example, in the peaceful use of atomic energy, the Soviet Union established the world's first atomic power station in 1954, and is continuing to build another larger atomic power station with a generating capacity of 2.5 million kilowatts; at the same time, it is also building the world's first atomic icebreaker; and the world's first atomic-powered aircraft. In 1956, the Soviet Union built the world's best and fastest "Tu-104" jet passenger plane, and in September this year, the "Tu-104A" aircraft created ten world records in one month. In August this year, the Soviet Union announced the development of intercontinental missiles, causing American newspapers to exclaim "this is a shocking change." On the 4th of this month, the Soviet Union launched the first man-made earth satellite, which shocked the world even more, because it not only further confirmed the fact that the Soviet Union had developed intercontinental missiles, but also opened up a new era for mankind to enter outer space.

　　It is precisely these shocking miracles of the Soviet Union in socialist construction, and its consistent policy of loving peace and opposing war, that have made it a fortress for defending world peace, making extremely outstanding contributions in defending world peace and promoting human progress. After World War II, American imperialism provoked the socialist camp and carried out a large-scale arms expansion. They boasted of "monopolizing atomic weapons," "exclusively possessing hydrogen bombs," "creating rocket weapons," etc., and have been rejecting Soviet disarmament proposals, threatening all mankind. The result is that the ironclad facts that the Soviet Union is lagging behind in aircraft manufacturing, atomic, nuclear weapons, or rocket launching are placed before American imperialism, and the reactionary rulers in the Pentagon dare not easily launch a third world war. The great achievements of socialist construction in the Soviet Union have made the socialist camp reach unprecedented unity, strength, and consolidation, giving great encouragement to the peace-loving people of the world, encouraging the movement of nationally independent countries against colonialism, against war, and in support of peaceful coexistence, and promoting the activities of democratic and peace-loving forces within imperialist countries against arms expansion and war preparation, ensuring the progress of mankind's peaceful construction cause.

　　When we recall these contributions of the October Revolution to mankind and all the great achievements of the great socialist country of the Soviet Union under the leadership of the CPSU in defending and developing the fruits of the October Revolution over the past forty years, we will naturally realize the incomparable superiority of the socialist system and the infinite vitality of Marxism-Leninism. In order to build our own motherland, to consolidate and develop our socialist camp, and to defend world peace and liberate all mankind, we must hold high the banner of the October Revolution and continue to advance.

　　In the course of marching along the victorious road of the Soviet Union, we certainly still have difficulties. The international imperialists and the domestic bourgeois rightists, although they have recently suffered serious setbacks, will never give up and will certainly look for opportunities to attack us again. Experience tells us that all reactionary classes are unwilling to withdraw from the political stage. They have always held a kind of illusion, believing that the source of strength of our socialist camp and socialist countries—the internationalist unity and cooperation of the world's proletariat and the socialist unity and cooperation of the people of all nationalities in the country—can be destroyed. We, the members of bourgeois political parties who are being transformed—bourgeois intellectuals—must be vigilant against these tricks of imperialism and domestic bourgeois rightists at all times and in all places. They always want to do everything possible to induce us to deviate from the correct path of the October Revolution, to leave our great socialist ally—the Soviet Union, and to leave Marxism-Leninism.

　　Chairman Mao, in "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," taught us with six criteria for judging the right and wrong of words and deeds in our people's political life, the most important of which are: "(1) It is conducive to the international unity of socialism and the international unity of peace-loving people all over the world, rather than detrimental to these unity; (2) It is conducive to consolidating the leadership of the Communist Party, rather than getting rid of or weakening this leadership." I think these two are very important not only in our current domestic political life, but also in international political life. Today, without the internationalist unity and cooperation of the proletariat, without the unity and cooperation of the people of all nationalities in the country under the leadership of the Party, we cannot continue to expand the fruits of the October Revolution and achieve the victory of the liberation of all mankind! Therefore, domestically, continuing to deepen our anti-rightist struggle, adhering to Marxism, opposing revisionism and dogmatism, striving for the complete victory of the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts in our country, and achieving further socialist unity and cooperation among the people of all nationalities in our country; internationally, continuing to consolidate and develop China-Soviet friendship and cooperation, consolidating the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and safeguarding and strengthening the internationalist unity of the proletariat all over the world, in order to counter the conspiracy activities of imperialism, are the lofty responsibilities that the people of our country, especially our intellectuals, must strive to undertake at present. Let us warmly celebrate the fortieth anniversary of the great October Revolution with infinite excitement and a sense of honor of being born in a new era of mankind! As long as we adhere to the truth of Marxism-Leninism, adhere to unity and progress, and bravely advance along the glorious road of the October Revolution, the realization of the ideal of the complete liberation of mankind will not be far away.

　　高举十月革命旗帜，继续前进！
　　中国民主同盟主席　沈钧儒
    十月革命一声炮响，震动了全世界，为人类历史开辟了一个崭新的时代。十月革命到现在虽只短短的四十年，但是它的革命影响已遍及全地球。现在整个人类处在这新时代中，正在步入一个日益光明和幸福的世界。
    四十年来的一切国家人民革命运动都是十月革命的继续，中国的革命和十月革命更是分不开的。中国人民在1840年遭受了鸦片战争的失败，就开始寻找能够摆脱殖民主义压迫，使国家富强的真理，经历了七十多年的漫长岁月，一直到1917年，在十月革命的启发、俄国人的介绍下，才找到了马克思列宁主义。从此中国的先进分子和世界各国的先进分子一样，学会了用无产阶级的世界观来重新考虑自己国家的问题，最后得出正确的结论——走俄国人的道路，也就是十月革命的道路。
    真理找到了，我们的革命运动就迅速展开了。1921年中国人民有了自己工人阶级的先锋队——中国共产党。在中国共产党领导下，中国人民经过了二十八年的斗争，取得了反帝、反封建、反官僚资本主义的民主革命的完全胜利，建立了以工人阶级为领导、以工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政的中华人民共和国；再经过八年的奋斗到今天，就把一个半封建半殖民地的中国改建成社会主义国家。在经济战线上我们已基本上完成了社会主义革命，在政治、思想战线上的社会主义革命，也已获得了初步但是决定性的胜利，在社会主义建设事业上，我们也将在今年年底超额完成发展国民经济的第一个五年计划，预计再有两三个五年计划，我们的国家就将成为一个名实相符的社会主义工业化大国了。
    在十月革命后四十年的短暂时间内，世界上就已出现了一个以苏联为首的社会主义国家的友好大家庭，这个大家庭拥有占全世界人口三分之一以上的人口，还拥有在地理上完全相连接的约占全球四分之一以上的土地，以及占世界工业总产值约三分之一的工业生产力量。四十年的经验告诉我们这个大家庭今后还将继续发展扩大，它是全世界没有解放的人类的太阳和希望，自然也就是对帝国主义的致命打击。
    在过去四十年中，苏联人民在苏联共产党领导下，在保卫和发展十月革命的成果，在进行社会主义建设方面取得了极其辉煌的成就。到目前，苏联已有许多主要项目赶上和超过了美国。最近在一系列的重要科学发明上，苏联都走在全世界的最前列，使自夸为工业先进的资本主义国家望尘莫及。像在和平利用原子能方面，苏联在1954年建立了世界第一座原子能发电站，且在继续建立着另一发电二百五十万瓩的更大的原子能发电站；同时还在建造着世界第一艘原子破冰船；世界第一架原子能飞机。1956年苏联建造出来世界上最好最快的“图—104”喷气式客机，今年9月一个月内“图—104A”飞机创造了十个世界纪录。今年8月苏联宣布制成了洲际导弹，使美国报纸惊呼“这是一个令人震惊的变化”。本月4日苏联发射出人类制造的第一颗地球卫星，更震动了全世界，因为它不只进一步证实了苏联制成洲际导弹的事实，同时又为人类开辟了一个进入宇宙空间的新时代。
    正是苏联在社会主义建设上这些令人震惊的奇迹，和它一贯爱好和平反对战争的政策，使它成为保卫世界和平的堡垒，在保卫世界和平和促进人类进步的事业方面作出极其卓越的贡献。第二次世界大战后，美国帝国主义向社会主义阵营挑衅，进行军备大扩张，他们自己夸耀“垄断了原子武器”，“独占了氢弹”，“创造了火箭武器”等等，并一直在拒绝苏联的裁军建议，威吓全世界人类。结果是不论飞机制造、原子、核子武器或火箭发射方面都落后于苏联的铁一般的事实，摆在了美帝国主义面前，五角大楼里的美国反动统治者才不敢轻易发动第三次世界大战。苏联的伟大的社会主义建设成就，使社会主义阵营达到空前未有的团结、强大和巩固，给予了全世界爱好和平的人民以极大的鼓舞，鼓励了民族独立国家的反对殖民主义、反对战争和支持和平共处的运动，推动了帝国主义国家内部爱好民主和平势力的反对扩军备战的活动，保证了人类和平建设事业的前进。
    当我们回想了十月革命给人类的这些贡献和伟大的社会主义国家苏联在苏共领导下四十年来保卫发展十月革命果实的一切丰功伟绩时，我们都自然会认识到社会主义制度的无比优越性和马克思列宁主义的无限生命力。为了建设我们自己的祖国，为了巩固发展我们的社会主义阵营，为了保卫世界和平解放全人类，我们一定要高举十月革命的旗帜继续前进。
    在沿着苏联的胜利道路进军的途程中，我们当然还是有困难的。国际间的帝国主义，国内的资产阶级右派，最近虽然他们都遭受到严重的挫败，但是他们决不会死心，一定伺隙要再向我们进攻。经验告诉我们，一切反动阶级是不甘心退出政治舞台的，他们一直在抱着一种幻想，认为我们社会主义阵营、社会主义国家的力量源泉——全世界无产阶级的国际主义团结合作和国内各民族人民的社会主义团结合作是可以破坏的。我们在改造中的资产阶级性政党的成员——资产阶级知识分子，更必须随时随地警惕帝国主义和国内资产阶级右派的这些伎俩。他们总是要想尽千方百计诱使我们离开十月革命的正确道路，离开我们伟大的社会主义盟邦——苏联，离开马克思列宁主义。
    毛主席在“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”中，曾以在我国人民政治生活中判断言行是非的六项标准教导我们，其中最重要的是：“（一）有利于社会主义的国际团结和全世界爱好和平人民的国际团结，而不是有损于这些团结；（二）有利于巩固共产党的领导，而不是摆脱或者削弱这种领导”。我想这两条对我们不只在当前国内的政治生活中，就是在国际政治生活中也是非常重要的。今天没有无产阶级的国际主义的团结合作，没有党领导下的国内各民族人民的团结合作，我们就不能继续扩大十月革命的战果，达到全人类解放的胜利！因此，在国内，继续深入我们的反右派斗争，坚持马克思主义，反对修正主义和教条主义，争取我国在政治战线上思想战线上社会主义革命的彻底胜利，达到我国各民族人民进一步的社会主义团结合作；在国际上，继续巩固、发展中苏友好合作，巩固以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结，维护、加强全世界无产阶级的国际主义团结，以反击帝国主义的阴谋活动，是当前我国人民，尤其是我们知识分子必须努力担当的崇高责任。让我们以无限兴奋的心情和生在人类新时代的光荣感，来热烈祝贺伟大的十月革命的四十周年节日吧！只要我们坚持马克思列宁主义的真理，坚持团结和进步，沿着十月革命的光辉道路勇猛前进，人类全部解放的理想的实现是不会很远了。
