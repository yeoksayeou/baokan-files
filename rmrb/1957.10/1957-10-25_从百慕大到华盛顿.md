From Bermuda to Washington
By a Commentator of This Newspaper

British Prime Minister Macmillan has gone to Washington to hold his second meeting with U.S. President Eisenhower since taking office from Eden. However, this time he was invited by the U.S. President to the U.S. capital as a guest of honor, instead of the humble visit to Bermuda more than half a year ago.

During the Bermuda talks last time, Britain had not yet recovered from the heavy blow it suffered in the Suez Canal incident, while the United States was proudly putting forward the Eisenhower Doctrine. The United States, after taking advantage of the situation, purely to save the British Empire a little face, found that colony nominally belonging to Britain but actually ruled by the United States, as the venue for the talks, to show "equality."

During the Bermuda talks, Britain urgently needed the "understanding" and support of the United States to heal its wounds and preserve its last colonial interests in the Middle East. To this end, it had to agree to pay a heavy price, recognizing the United States' hegemonic position in the Middle East colonialist forces, and temporarily playing a supporting role. On the American side, the main purpose at the time was to undermine the prestige of the British Empire, so that it would give up its territory in the Middle East, so that it could gradually fill the "vacuum."

After the Bermuda Conference, Britain used this period of respite to shrink its overseas strategic lines, streamline its military plans, and adjust its diplomatic steps. For more than half a year, Britain has finally recovered some strength and stabilized its position in the region. However, the United States has encountered very unsatisfactory things. The Eisenhower Doctrine suffered a serious setback in the Middle East. After the Jordan incident, Washington was full of hope to create another Syria and Egypt incident. Contrary to expectations, the subversive conspiracies planned by the United States in Syria were exposed one after another. The United States was exasperated and even came forward through the president to slander independent Syria and openly threatened to invoke the Eisenhower Doctrine to conduct armed intervention. For this purpose, the United States loudly transported weapons to Syria's neighboring countries, dispatched fleets to carry out threats, and actively arranged for Turkey, Israel and other lackeys to provoke incidents. The colonialist features of the Eisenhower Doctrine were completely exposed, and the people of the Middle East launched a wave of opposition to U.S. imperialism aggression, and Arab countries restored unity on the issue of defending the interests of the Arab nation. The Syrian people and the people of various Arab countries have also received strong support from many peace-loving and national independence advocating countries, especially the powerful socialist countries. The news of the successful Soviet intercontinental ballistic missile test, especially the launch of the first man-made earth satellite, shook the world and gave a fatal blow to the "policy of strength" pursued by the Western military bloc headed by the United States. All myths about the American "superiority" were punctured, the atomic blackmail policy was completely bankrupt, and as an article by columnist Alsop published in the "Washington Post" put it, "decay has finally been clearly exposed." The impact of this has caused fierce complaints and curses within the imperialist camp, Washington has become the target of public criticism, and the US ruling group is full of panic and confusion.

It is precisely because of this sense of urgency that the U.S. President specially and solemnly received the British Queen who visited the United States, and in toasting her, went beyond the norm to advocate that "we must work together." Everyone remembers that just a few months ago, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles得意地表示他不愿再看到英法这些穷伙计站在美国的旁边, which caused a great uproar in British and French public opinion.

Of course, Macmillan is not at ease this time either. The rise of the national independence movement in the Middle East and the profound impression created by the unparalleled superiority of socialist countries on the whole world are equally the most troubling things for Britain. Therefore, Reuters estimates that the primary issue of this meeting is to estimate "the relative strength of the West" after the successful launch of intercontinental missiles and earth satellites by the Soviet Union, and secondly, the situation in the Middle East including "a frank assessment of the effect of the Eisenhower Doctrine." This is reasonable. However, since the United States is now the first to bear the brunt, Macmillan has a much better bargaining chip. Therefore, it is conceivable that he will try to get something back from Eisenhower. One of the existing claims is that Britain will ask the United States to re-recognize Britain's considerable position in the Western Group and the Middle East, tear down the "scientific iron curtain" between the United States and Britain, and carry out "cooperation" in the development of nuclear weapons and space warfare weapons. For a long time, Britain has been extremely dissatisfied with the United States' consistent efforts to exclude and belittle Britain and strictly guard the secrets of nuclear weapons from it. And Britain's resistance to the infiltration of American forces into the Middle East is also well known.

From the Bermuda talks to the Washington talks, the positions of Britain and the United States have changed to a certain extent. If Britain needed the Anglo-American "alliance" more during the Bermuda talks, then it is the United States that needs the Anglo-American "alliance" more during this Washington talks. But it would be naive to think that the Washington talks will achieve more than the Bermuda talks in resolving the fundamental contradictions between the United States and Britain.

    从百慕大到华盛顿
    本报评论员
    英国首相麦克米伦已经到华盛顿去，同美国总统艾森豪威尔举行他继艾登之任以来的第二次会谈。不过这一次他是被美国总统作为贵宾请去美国的首都，而不是像半年多以前低声下气地到百慕大晋见美国总统的情况。
    在上次百慕大会谈时，英国还没有从在苏伊士事件中所受到的沉重打击下喘息过来，美国却正提出艾森豪威尔主义而趾高气扬。美国在狠狠地趁火打劫之余，纯粹为了给大英帝国留最后一点面子，才找到了那块名义上为英国所属而实际上已为美国所统治的殖民地，作为会谈的地点，以示“平等”。
    在百慕大会谈时期，英国急需美国的“谅解”和支持，以医治它的创伤，保住它在中东的最后一部分殖民利益。为此，它不得不同意付出重大的代价，承认美国在中东殖民主义势力中的霸主地位，自己暂时充当配角。在美国方面，当时主要是杀英帝国的威风，使它让出中东的地盘，以便自己逐步填补“真空”。
    百慕大会议以后，英国利用这一段喘息的时间，收缩了海外的战略线，精简了军事计划，调整了外交步骤。半年多以来，英国总算恢复了一些元气，稳定了在这个地区的阵脚。但是，美国却碰到了极不如意的事情。艾森豪威尔主义在中东遭受了严重的挫折。约旦事件之后，华盛顿满怀希望地想再搞一个叙利亚和埃及事件。事与愿违，美国在叙利亚策划的颠覆阴谋被接二连三地揭发了。美国恼羞成怒，竟由总统出面，对坚持独立的叙利亚进行污蔑，并公然威胁要援引艾森豪威尔主义进行武装干涉。为此目的，美国敲锣打鼓地向叙利亚邻国运送武器，出动舰队进行威胁，并积极布置土、以等喽啰寻衅。艾森豪威尔主义的殖民主义凶相暴露无遗，中东人民掀起反对美帝国主义侵略的浪潮，阿拉伯国家在保卫阿拉伯民族利益问题上恢复了团结。叙利亚人民和阿拉伯各国人民又得到了许多爱好和平和主张民族独立的国家，特别是强大的社会主义国家的有力支持。苏联试验洲际弹道导弹成功的消息，特别是第一颗人造地球卫星的发射，震动了全世界，给了以美国为首的西方军事集团所奉行的“实力政策”以致命的打击。所有关于美国“优势”的神话全戳穿了，原子讹诈政策彻底破产了，用“华盛顿邮报”上刊载的专栏作家艾尔索普一篇文章的提法，是“腐朽终于清清楚楚地暴露出来了”。影响所及，在帝国主义阵营内部引起了激烈的抱怨和咀咒，华盛顿成了众矢之的，美国统治集团内部充满了惊惶和混乱。
    正是由于这种紧迫感，美国总统才特别隆重地接待了访美的英国女王，并且在为她干杯中超乎常例地主张“我们必须一起工作”。大家都记得，不过几个月以前，美国国务卿杜勒斯还曾经得意地表示他不愿再看到英法这些穷伙计站在美国的旁边，使得英法舆论大哗。
    当然，麦克米伦这一次也并不是一身轻松。中东民族独立运动的高涨和社会主义国家的无比优越性对全世界造成的深刻印象，对英国同样是最伤脑筋的事。因此，路透社估计，这次会谈的首要问题是估计在苏联发射洲际导弹和地球卫星成功以后“西方的相对力量”，其次是中东的局势包括“坦率估价艾森豪威尔主义的效果”。这是有道理的。不过，这一次既然首当其冲的是美国，那末麦克米伦就有了好得多的讨价还价的本钱。因而可以设想，他将设法从艾森豪威尔那里捞回一些东西。这方面已经有的说法是，英国将要求美国重新承认英国在西方集团和中东的相当地位，撕下美英之间的“科学铁幕”，在发展核武器和空间战争武器方面进行“合作”。长期以来，英国对于美国一贯竭力排挤和贬低英国并对它严守核武器的秘密，是极为不满的。而英国抗拒美国势力的渗入中东地区，也是人所共知的。
    从百慕大会谈到华盛顿会谈，英美所处的地位起了一定程度的变化。如果说，在百慕大会谈时英国更加需要英美“联盟”的话，那末，在这次华盛顿会谈中更加需要英美“联盟”的却是美国了。但是如果认为在解决美英的根本矛盾方面，华盛顿会谈会比百慕大会谈取得较多的成就，那将是一种天真的想法。
