Cadres Closely Rely on the Masses, Masses Actively Assist Cadres
Significant Progress in Rectification in Some Factories and Mines in Chongqing
Some Factories Begin to Show Signs of a Production Upsurge

(Our Dispatch) Chongqing: Cadres in some factories and mining enterprises in Chongqing have, during the rectification movement, learned to use the working method of the mass line to solve problems, greatly inspiring the workers' sense of being masters of their own affairs and their enthusiasm for labor production. Some factory workers have put forward the slogan of "rectifying while suggesting," actively helping the leadership solve problems related to welfare. For example, the cadres of the open-hearth furnace workshop of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company once dealt with the opinions of the masses day and night. However, the masses did not appreciate their hard work, but criticized them as: "Rectifying while reforming, but never really reforming," and "The opinions handled are all 'trivial matters'." The cadres accepted the criticism of the masses and began to deal with the issues of concern to the majority of the masses; they established various professional groups, absorbed workers to participate, and solicited workers' opinions; they promptly announced the results of the handling. In this way, problems were handled much faster, and the opinions of the masses were reduced.

A section chief in the third workshop of the Jialing Machine Factory, at first, stayed up all night alone to deal with the opinions raised by the masses to the section, but very few were actually resolved. The masses criticized him for being procrastinating, and he realized that he must take the mass line and hand over all kinds of opinions to the masses to study and deal with them together. He processed more than sixty items in two days.

This approach of the cadres also educated the masses and strengthened their sense of responsibility as masters of their own affairs.

Many vivid examples of workers handling various problems with the attitude of masters of their own affairs have emerged in Chongqing Iron and Steel Company. The workers proposed, "Rectification is the business of the working class itself," and "The leadership proposes 'rectifying while reforming,' and we will 'suggest while rectifying'." Recently, forty-nine worker families gave up their houses to workers who lacked housing. The trade union allocated two new houses to Shi Gongwen Quangui, but he refused, saying, "My house is still habitable, allocate it to comrades who lack housing." Recently, thirteen new houses were allocated to the machine repair workshop. Because the workers helped each other, the housing difficulties of forty-two families were solved. Zheng Xiqing, a worker in the small rolling mill workshop, posted a big-character poster saying, "The kitchen at home leaks rain, cooking with an umbrella." Worker Wang Liyuan said, "This does not need to be solved by the leadership." After work, he invited several workers to repair Zheng Xiqing's kitchen.

In the sixth workshop of the Jialing Machine Factory, the management and use of tools used to be quite chaotic. For example, some workers, in order to use the tools well, locked the tools in their own toolboxes after work. Other workers could not find the tools after work and opened other people's toolboxes to check, which often caused disputes. The workshop cadres racked their brains but could not solve it. This time the workers criticized this phenomenon. The cadres let the workers discuss it themselves and propose solutions. The workers launched criticism and self-criticism with the attitude of being masters of their own affairs. Everyone re-formulated the tool management system, supervised each other, and conscientiously implemented it. Thus, the chaotic phenomenon of tool management and use that had not been solved for a long time was eliminated.

In some factories, workshops, or work sections, because cadres took the mass line in the rectification movement and correctly handled various problems, the enthusiasm of the masses for labor began to rise, constantly creating new records, and began to show signs of a production upsurge.

The Southwest No. 1 Silk Textile Factory has already handled 95.8% of the opinions raised by the masses, organized inspection teams composed of workers and technicians to check them one by one, and the staff and worker representatives conference believes that 99% of the opinions have been handled appropriately. In September, the factory unprecedentedly and comprehensively overfulfilled the seven major indicators, producing five A and six A grade silk; the qualified rate of spun silk reached 100%; and it overfulfilled the third quarter plan by 5.7%, reversing the usual practice of declining output and quality in the third quarter due to hot weather over the years.

Since the Chongqing Iron and Steel Company Refractory Materials Workshop began rectification on September 18, eighty new records have emerged. The first week's production plan was overfulfilled by 3.34%, the second week by 9.73%, and the third week by 14.25%. Hu Qingyun, an old worker in the raw material section, saw that the opinions raised by the masses had been dealt with, felt happy, and took the initiative to study with the squad leader and workers to eliminate the chaotic phenomenon of busy production. Everyone clarified the division of labor, each with their own responsibilities. They continuously created six new production records, the highest exceeding the plan by 89%.

However, some cadres in some factories and mining enterprises still have some problems in taking the mass line and relying on the masses to solve problems. The most noteworthy is: regardless of whether the opinions and demands raised by the masses are correct, they are all accepted; unreasonable or unachievable demands are not explained or persuaded. This practice aroused the dissatisfaction of the majority of the masses, who criticized it as "taking the mass line with eyes closed."

    干部密切依靠群众　群众主动协助干部
    重庆部分厂矿整改大有进展
    有些工厂开始露出生产高潮的苗头
    本报讯　重庆市部分厂矿企业的干部，在整风运动中，学会走群众路线解决问题的工作方法，大大鼓舞了工人当家作主的主人翁感觉和劳动生产热情。有的工厂工人已提出“边提边改”口号，主动帮助领导上解决生活福利问题。比如重庆钢铁公司大型平炉车间的干部们，有一个时期，曾经不分白天黑夜地处理群众意见。可是群众并不体谅他们的辛劳，反而批评他们是：“边整边改，老是不改”，“处理的意见尽是‘鸡毛蒜皮’”。干部接受了群众的批评，着手处理多数群众关心的问题；成立各种专业组，吸收工人参加，征求工人意见；及时公布处理结果。这样，问题的处理迅速得多，群众的意见也少了。
    嘉陵机器厂三车间有个段长，开始他一个人守更熬夜地处理群众给段上提的意见，但真正解决的却很少。群众批评他办事拖拉，他才意识到必须走群众路线，把各种意见交给群众一齐动手研究处理，两天内就处理了六十多条。
    干部们的这种做法，也教育了群众，加强了主人翁的责任感。
    重庆钢铁公司就出现过许多工人以主人翁的态度，动手处理各种问题的生动事例。工人们提出，“整风是工人阶级自己的事情”，“领导上提出‘边整边改’，我们来个‘边提边改’”。最近有四十九户工人让出自己住的房子，给缺少房子的工人。工会给石工文全贵分配两间新房子，他不要，说，“我的房子还能住，分配给缺少房子的同志吧”。最近机修车间分配到十三户新住宅，因为工人们互助互让，结果解决了四十二户人缺房的困难。小型轧钢车间工人郑锡清出张大字报，说“家中灶房漏雨，打伞做饭”。工人王立元说，“这用不着领导上解决”。他下了班，邀集几位工人就把郑锡清的灶房修好了。
    嘉陵机器厂六车间，过去工具管理和使用相当混乱。例如，有些工人为了使用好工具，下班后把工具锁在自己工具箱里，其他工人上班后找不到工具，就把别人的工具箱打开检查，常常引起纠纷。车间干部绞尽脑汁也解决不了。这次工人们对这种现象提出批评。干部就让工人自己讨论，提出处理办法。工人以当家作主的态度展开了批评和自我批评，大家重新制定了工具管理制度，互相监督，切实执行。从而消除了长期不能解决的工具管理和使用的混乱现象。
    有些工厂、车间或工段，由于在整风运动中干部走了群众路线，正确地处理了各种问题，群众劳动热情开始上涨，不断创造新纪录，开始露出生产高潮的苗头。
    西南第一丝纺厂已经处理了群众提出的95.8％的意见，组织工人和技术人员参加的检查组，逐件作了检查，职工代表大会认为，99％的意见处理得是恰当的。这个厂9月份就空前全面超额完成了七大指标，出现了五A、六A的高级丝；绢丝合格率达到100％；并且超额5.7％完成了第三季度计划，扭转了历年第三季度因天气炎热，产量质量下降的惯例。
    重庆钢铁公司耐火材料车间从9月18日开始整风以来，出现了八十个新纪录。第一周产量计划超额3.34％，第二周超额9.73％，第三周超额14.25％。生料段老工人胡清云看到群众提出的意见都作了处理，心情畅快，主动和班长、工人研究，消除生产忙乱一团现象，大家明确分工，各有专责。他们连续创造六个生产新纪录，最高超过计划89％。
    但是，有些厂矿企业的干部，在走群众路线，依靠群众解决问题中，也还存在着一些问题，最值得注意的是：不管群众提的意见和要求是否正确，一律接受下来；办不到或者不合理的要求，也不加以解释和说服。这种做法引起了大多数群众的不满，批评为“闭着眼睛走群众路线”。
