　　More Milk Needed
　　Han Guang, Chen Yu
    Since 1953, a dozen or so large dairy plants have been newly built or expanded in Heilongjiang, Inner Mongolia, Gansu, Qinghai, and other regions where milk sources are relatively concentrated. In 1956, the national output of dairy products reached more than 6,000 tons, an increase of 238% compared to 1952. This year, the national output of various dairy products has risen to more than 8,700 tons, an increase of 45% compared to 1956. However, the situation of supply falling short of demand for dairy products in the market has not changed, and various regions are constantly requesting increased production of milk powder.
    How can we increase the production of dairy products? We believe that the following issues need to be studied and resolved.
    Low Cow Milk Production
    According to the data from the National Dairy Products Conference last year, there are a total of 3.98 million dairy cows in the country, of which 180,000 are better improved breeds (of which about 110,000 are actually producing milk), and 3.8 million are local breeds that can produce a small amount of milk. The average annual milk production of each improved breed dairy cow can reach 2,500 to 3,000 kilograms, while the annual milk production of local breeds is about 300 kilograms. In total, the country can produce about 1.2 million tons of milk annually. Local breeds are mostly concentrated in pastoral areas, and because of inconvenient transportation, very little cow milk is actually sold. Only about 200,000 tons of cow milk are actually sold as commodities, and about two-thirds of this is used for urban residents to drink. In 1956, only 65,000 to 70,000 tons of cow milk were supplied for industrial processing. Therefore, the equipment capacity of many dairy plants cannot be fully utilized. Some plants can only obtain raw materials to meet 30%-40% of their equipment capacity. In addition, the lactation period of local breeds is short, generally only four or five months, which also makes factories only able to carry out seasonal production, making management difficult and causing economic losses.
    To solve the problem of milk sources, the fundamental solution is to improve local breeds, extend the lactation period, and increase milk production. However, this issue has not yet received attention from relevant departments, and some agricultural and animal husbandry management departments have even weakened management forces in some areas.
    Low Milk Price
    The excessively low price of cow milk also affects the growth of milk sources. Herdsmen feel that raising dairy cows is less profitable or even unprofitable, so they no longer manage them carefully. In winter, dairy cows often spend the winter in icy and snowy conditions of minus forty degrees Celsius, and they are often not fed enough, so the milk production of cows decreases significantly, and some even stop producing milk.
    Due to the low milk price, herdsmen are particularly inattentive to the breeding of calves and stud bulls. It takes a lot of effort to raise a calf, but when it grows up, selling milk is not worth much, and selling the cow is not cost-effective.
    Many Problems with Feeding Management
    Inner Mongolia and Heilongjiang are rich in sugar beet leaves, potatoes, corn stalks, etc., which are juicy feeds that have a great effect on increasing milk production. However, at present, the relevant leading organs in various regions generally lack understanding and technical guidance on the planting and utilization of these juicy feeds. At the same time, the types of concentrated feed are too simple and the supply is insufficient. For example, in Zhalomde Town, Hulunbuir League, Inner Mongolia, no concentrated feed has been purchased from June 1956 to June 1957, and the herdsmen have many complaints.
    There are also cows with tuberculosis and abortion in the dairy cow herd, especially in Hulunbuir League, Inner Mongolia, it is said that there are also infectious diseases such as bovine lung plague. Herdsmen report that they rarely see veterinarians and animal husbandry technicians coming down to work.
    In terms of selecting and retaining stud bulls, because herdsmen feel that raising stud bulls is not as cost-effective as raising dairy cows, they are unwilling to raise stud bulls, so the number of stud bulls is gradually decreasing. For example, there are more than 700 adult dairy cows in Yakeshi District, Hulunbuir League, Inner Mongolia, but only two stud bulls. Therefore, herdsmen report that dairy cows are getting worse from generation to generation.
    Two Suggestions
    In order to expand milk sources and rapidly develop China's dairy industry, we suggest:
    (1)
    Improve the feeding management of dairy cows and improve the breed of local cows.
    In areas with suitable conditions, such as Inner Mongolia, Heilongjiang, Xinjiang, Qinghai, Gansu, as well as Fujian, Guangdong, and other places, local agricultural and animal husbandry departments should establish technical guidance organizations for dairy cow improvement and feeding management, and equip them with an appropriate number of animal husbandry and veterinary technicians to help herdsmen develop the dairy cow business. On this basis, a national dairy cow development plan should be formulated as the basis for the industrial sector to formulate a dairy industry development plan.
    Experience has proven that crossing the North Manchurian cattle along the Binzhou railway with local Mongolian cattle, the first generation of cattle can produce an average of 1,623.5 kilograms of milk in the first lactation period (300 days), and those with good feeding management conditions can reach 2,915.5 kilograms, which is more than five times the increase in milk production compared to the parent cow. Moreover, the results are relatively quick, generally the first generation of hybrid cattle can produce milk in about three years.
    On the issue of feed, given that China's grain output is not very high at present, it is unrealistic to rely solely on the grain department to solve the feed problem. To solve the feed problem, the first thing to do is to establish and enrich dairy cow management organizations in various regions, and through it, provide herdsmen with help and guidance on feed planting technology, and gradually achieve self-sufficiency in grain feed, especially juicy feed. Before herdsmen have the habit and technology of planting feed, the supply of feed still needs strong support from the grain department for the time being.
    The price of milk is one of the driving forces for stimulating the development of the dairy industry. It is recommended that the industrial and agricultural and animal husbandry departments negotiate in the spirit of taking into account both industry and agriculture to make reasonable arrangements.
    (2)
    Reasonably allocate milk sources and greatly increase the production of edible dairy products. Use the scattered milk sources in ethnic minority areas to increase the production of industrial dairy products.
    At present, foreign countries have generally used substitutes to replace lactose and casein to manufacture penicillin and plastics. Therefore, we should not use the best cow milk to manufacture lactose, casein, and other industrial dairy products. We suggest that the Hailar Lactose Factory, which has already been built, be converted to produce milk powder. The Anda Lactose Factory, which is currently under review and design, should be converted into a factory with milk powder and condensed milk as its main products.
    The small amount of lactose, casein, etc. used in industry, in addition to continuing to be supplied by some factories in Inner Mongolia, can be considered to be supplied by pastoral areas such as Xinjiang, Qinghai, and Gansu. These areas have a large number of local cows, and herdsmen have the habit of raising cattle and squeezing milk for drinking, so milk sources are very abundant. However, at present, there is only one dairy plant each in Qinghai and Gansu, and Xinjiang is still a blank spot. We believe that we can first select areas with better conditions for milk sources, transportation, fuel, water, and electricity, and invest in the establishment of flat-bottomed manual factories. This requires less investment and yields quick results, which can not only meet the current needs of industrial dairy products, but also promote herdsmen to increase the production of cow milk, and prepare conditions for the construction of large-scale dairy plants. (Attached picture)
    The Gannan Dairy Plant on the Hezuo Grassland in the Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of Gansu Province can produce more than 1,500 tons of Golden Cow milk powder every year. This factory has set up more than a dozen milk collection stations in various pastoral areas. This is the Gaga Tan herdsmen selling milk to the milk collection station.

　　需要更多的牛奶
　　韩光　陈玉
    从1953年起，在乳源比较集中的黑龙江、内蒙古、甘肃、青海等地，相继新建和扩建了十几个比较大的乳品厂。1956年，全国乳制品的产量达到了六千多吨，比1952年增加了238％。今年全国各种乳制品产量上升到八千七百多吨，比1956年又增加了45％。但是，市场上乳制品供不应求的情况仍未改变，各地不断地提出要求增产乳粉。
    怎样能够增产乳制品呢？我们认为，下面几个问题是需要研究解决的。
    牛乳产量少
    根据去年全国乳品会议资料记载，全国共有三百九十八万头乳牛，其中较好的改良种乳牛有十八万头
  （其中实际产乳的约有十一万头），能产少量乳的土种乳牛有三百八十万头。每头改良种乳牛的年产乳量，平均可达二千五百到三千公斤，土种牛年产乳三百公斤左右，合计起来，全国每年可产乳一百二十万吨左右。土种牛多集中在牧区，因为交通不便，实际上很少出售牛乳。真正作为商品出售的牛乳，仅有二十万吨左右，而其中又约有三分之二是供城市居民饮用的，1956年供给工业加工用的牛乳，仅有六万五千到七万吨。因此许多乳品厂的设备能力便不能充分发挥，有些厂能够获得的原料仅能满足设备能力的30％—40％。此外，土种牛的泌乳期短，一般仅四、五个月，因此，也使得工厂只能进行季节性的生产，管理上困难，经济上也受损失。
    要解决乳源问题，根本办法是改良土种牛，延长泌乳期，提高产乳量。但是这个问题目前还没有引起有关部门的重视，有些农牧管理部门甚至在某些地区削弱了管理力量。
    乳价太低
    牛乳的价格过低，也影响着乳源的增长。牧民感到养乳牛利少甚至无利可图，就不再细心管理。冬季乳牛常在零下四十多度的冰天雪地过冬，而且经常吃不饱，因此牛的产乳量显著下降，有的甚至停止出乳了。
    由于乳价低，牧民对小牛和种公牛的培育特别不精心。把一头小牛养大要付出很大代价，但是，等养大了，卖乳不值钱，卖牛也不合算。
    饲养管理问题多
    内蒙古、黑龙江一带盛产甜菜叶、马铃薯、玉米秸等，这些多汁的饲料对提高产乳量有很大作用。但是，目前各地有关的领导机关对这些多汁饲料的种植与利用，还普遍缺乏认识与技术指导。同时精饲料的种类也过于单纯，并且供应不足，如内蒙古呼伦贝尔盟扎罗木得镇，自1956年6月至1957年6月，根本没有购到精饲料，牧民很有意见。
    在乳牛群里，还混有结核、流产牛，特别在内蒙古呼伦贝尔盟，据说还有牛肺疫等传染病。牧民反映，很少看到兽医和畜牧技术人员下来工作。
    在选留种公牛方面，因为牧民感觉养公牛不如养乳牛合算，不愿养公牛，因此种公牛渐渐减少。如内蒙古呼伦贝尔盟牙克石区有成年乳牛七百余头，仅有两头种公牛。所以牧民反映，乳牛一代不如一代了。
    两点建议
    为了扩大乳源，迅速发展我国的乳品工业，我们建议：
    （一）
    改善对乳牛的饲养管理，改良土种牛的品种。
    各地农牧部门在有条件的地区，如内蒙古、黑龙江、新疆、青海、甘肃以及福建、广东等地，应建立乳牛改良及饲养管理技术指导机构，配备适当数量的畜牧兽医技术人员，帮助牧民发展乳牛事业，并在这一基础上制订全国乳牛发展规划，作为工业部门制定乳品工业发展规划的依据。
    经验证明，用滨州沿线的北满牛与当地蒙古牛杂交，第一代牛的第一个泌乳期（三百天）平均可产乳一千六百二十三点五公斤，饲养管理条件好的可达二千九百十五点五公斤，比亲母牛增加乳量达五倍多。而且收效比较快，一般第一代杂种牛约三年多的时间即可产乳。
    在饲料问题上，鉴于目前我国粮食产量还不很高，因此单纯依靠粮食部门解决饲料，是不现实的。要解决饲料问题首先应当在各地建立和充实乳牛管理机构，通过它在饲料种植技术上给牧民以帮助与指导，逐步做到谷类饲料特别是多汁饲料能够自给自足。在牧民还没有种植饲料的习惯与技术之前，饲料的供应，暂时还需要粮食部门大力支持。
    乳价是刺激乳品工业发展的动力之一，建议由工业农牧两个部门，本着工农兼顾的精神协商，合理安排。
    （二）
    合理调配乳源，大量增产食用乳制品。利用少数民族地区分散的乳源增产工业用乳制品。
    目前国外已普遍采用代用品代替乳糖与干酪素来制造青霉素与塑料。因此，我们也不应当把最好的牛乳用来制造乳糖、干酪素等工业用乳制品。我们建议将已经建成的海拉尔乳糖厂改产乳粉。正在审查设计的安达乳糖厂改成以乳粉、炼乳为主要产品的工厂。
    工业用的少量乳糖、干酪素等，除继续从内蒙古一些工厂供应一部分外，可以考虑由新疆、青海、甘肃等牧区供应。这些地区有大量的土种牛，牧民都有养牛挤乳饮用的习惯，所以乳源是很丰富的。但是目前仅在青海、甘肃各有一个乳品厂，新疆还是一个空白点。我们认为，可以先选择乳源、交通、燃料、水、电等条件较好的地区，投资建立平锅式手工工厂，这样做投资少、收效快，既可满足目前工业乳品的需要，又可以推动牧民增产牛乳，为建设大型的乳品厂准备条件。（附图片）
    甘肃省甘南藏族自治州合作草原上的甘南乳品厂，每年可生产金牛奶粉一千五百多吨。这个厂在各牧区设置了十多个收奶站，这是加尕滩牧民们向收奶站售牛奶。
