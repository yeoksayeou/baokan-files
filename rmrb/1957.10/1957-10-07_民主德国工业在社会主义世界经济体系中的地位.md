    The Position of the German Democratic Republic's Industry in the Socialist World Economic System
    By Dr. Lota Luszczik, German Democratic Republic
    Socialism has transcended the confines of a single country and developed into a world system. Simultaneously, a unified socialist economic system has emerged, developing according to the same economic laws and towards the same direction. Within the socialist camp, in addition to traditional forms of economic cooperation such as foreign trade and loans, new forms of cooperation unique to socialist countries have emerged in recent years. These include technical and economic cooperation, mutual coordination of national economic plans, specialization and collaboration in production, and mutual assistance in investment to expand raw material bases, and so on.
    The Soviet Union and the European People's Democracies (including the German Democratic Republic) established the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance specifically for this economic cooperation.
    Among the participating countries of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance, the industry of the German Democratic Republic occupies an important position. This is because its industry is highly developed, both broad and concentrated. At the same time, 85% of the industry of the German Democratic Republic is socialist. The industrial production of the German Democratic Republic now accounts for 58% of the total social production. If the construction industry, small-scale industry, and handicrafts are also included, then the proportion in the total social production would be as high as 70%, with employees accounting for about half of all workers in the national economy. There are a total of 2.8 million employees in the industrial enterprises of the German Democratic Republic. The proportion of industrial workers in the national population is second in Europe, after the United Kingdom. The number of industrial workers in the German Democratic Republic accounts for about one-tenth of the total number of industrial workers in the Soviet Union and the European People's Democracies.
    The German Democratic Republic's electricity production is the foundation of modernization technology for all industrial and economic sectors. The amount of electricity generated by a country indicates its level of industrial development. In 1956, the German Democratic Republic produced a total of 31.2 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity, ranking second in the socialist world economic system, approximately one-sixth of the Soviet Union's electricity production. The German Democratic Republic accounts for approximately 12% of the total electricity production of the Soviet Union, the European People's Democracies, and China. If calculated per capita, then the German Democratic Republic's electricity production will rank first among socialist countries. The German Democratic Republic averages 1,580 kilowatt-hours of electricity per person, more than double to five times that of the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries.
    However, due to the structure of the German Democratic Republic's industrial sectors, the electricity produced is still insufficient to meet needs. The machinery manufacturing industry ranks first among the industrial sectors of the German Democratic Republic, followed by the chemical industry, which accounts for 18% of the total industrial output, and then the food industry and the textile industry. The chemical industry is a major consumer of electricity, requiring more than one-third of the total electricity generated.
    Due to the division of Germany, the German Democratic Republic lacks hard coal and steel. Even if the abundant lignite mines are fully exploited, it will not be possible to completely meet the needs of the German Democratic Republic's national economy. Despite this, the German Democratic Republic's coal production (converted to hard coal) still reaches an average of 3.8 tons per person, equivalent to the People's Republic of Poland, ranking first in the socialist camp.
    In the past few years, we have encountered particular difficulties in the supply of steel. In 1956, the German Democratic Republic already produced 2.7 million tons of steel, compared to only 1.19 million tons in 1936. However, this is still insufficient to meet the needs of the machinery manufacturing industry and other economic sectors. In 1955, the average steel production per capita in socialist countries was: Czechoslovakia – 350 kg, Soviet Union – 232 kg, Hungary – 176 kg, Poland – 170 kg, German Democratic Republic – 135 kg, Romania – 50 kg, Bulgaria – 28 kg, China – 6 kg. Even after the completion of the Second Five-Year Plan in 1960, the German Democratic Republic's steel production will average about 190 kg per person, still significantly lower than the current level of Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union. Due to favorable production conditions, the Soviet Union will continue to be the main supplier of steel in the socialist camp.
    In machinery manufacturing, the German Democratic Republic, like the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia, plays an important role. The German Democratic Republic's machinery manufacturing industry includes many sectors, mainly located in the southern region of the Republic. The degree of development of each sector of machinery manufacturing varies. Within the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance, in 1955, the German Democratic Republic produced 11% of the machine tools, 33% of the forging equipment, 15% of the metallurgical equipment, 80% of the cement equipment, 95% of the open-pit mining equipment, and 100% of the coal briquette factory equipment.
    In the manufacture of electrical machinery, hoisting and transportation machinery, automobiles and ships, chemical industry equipment, instruments, printing machinery equipment, light industry and food industry equipment, and enterprise measurement and control equipment, the German Democratic Republic ranks second among socialist countries. At the same time, the German Democratic Republic supplies more than 20% of its metal processing industry products to socialist countries, vigorously supporting these countries' socialist industrialization plans. The German Democratic Republic is the largest exporter of machinery and equipment, and therefore can provide valuable machinery and equipment and rich experience to the People's Democracies. It has supplied many complete sets of equipment to the countries of the socialist camp.
    In chemical production, the German Democratic Republic also ranks second in the socialist economic system, second only to the Soviet Union. The German Democratic Republic's chemical industry employs 240,000 people. The base of the chemical industry is in the central region of Germany. There are many lignite mines, limestone mines, gypsum mines, potassium carbonate mines, and salt mines with abundant reserves, as well as large chemical plants that use these raw materials for production. In 1956, the German Democratic Republic's chemical industry produced 9% of the sulfuric acid, 21% of the caustic soda, 25% of the sodium hydroxide, 30% of the chlorine gas, 23% of the nitrogen fertilizer, 62% of the potash fertilizer, 56% of the calcium carbide, and 67% of the polyvinyl chloride resin in the countries of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance. 17% of the German Democratic Republic's chemical products are exported; in recent years, there are more raw materials than processed products. The German Democratic Republic provided enormous technical and scientific assistance to other socialist countries in building their own chemical industries. Experts from the German Democratic Republic regularly assist in the construction and implementation of new production methods in various socialist countries. Similarly, experts from various socialist countries often visit our chemical combines.
    In terms of foreign trade, the German Democratic Republic's trade volume ranks second among the People's Democracies. Our largest trading partner is the Soviet Union. In 1955, our trade volume with the Soviet Union reached 3.751 billion rubles, accounting for 43% of our total foreign trade volume. 74.4% of the exports to the Soviet Union were machinery and equipment, 22% were raw materials and fuels, 1.6% were food, and 1% were industrial consumer goods. The Soviet Union supplied us with the coal, coking coal, rolled materials, and non-ferrous metals we needed. In 1955, 73.5% of the goods supplied by the Soviet Union to our country were raw materials and fuels, and 25% were food. In 1957, the exchange of goods between the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic increased by 30% compared to 1956.
    Trade with the People's Republic of China also plays an important role in the German Democratic Republic's economy. China is one of the countries in the world with the richest raw materials, and it will supply our country with mineral sands, non-ferrous metals, and other important raw materials.
    The coordination of national economic plans of socialist countries will help to overcome the imbalances in the German Democratic Republic's economic development. On the other hand, the German Democratic Republic also contributes to promoting the economic development of other socialist countries by providing machinery and equipment and high-level technical assistance. This equal and mutually beneficial cooperation and sincere and selfless mutual assistance are important factors for the vigorous development of the socialist economic system and catching up with and surpassing the production levels of the most developed capitalist countries in the shortest historical period.

    民主德国工业在社会主义世界经济体系中的地位
    德意志民主共和国　罗塔·路斯齐克博士
    社会主义已经越出了一国的范围而发展成为一个世界体系。与此同时，也产生了一个按照同样的经济规律和朝着同一个方向发展的统一的社会主义经济体系。在社会主义阵营中，除了旧有的经济合作形式如进行对外贸易和贷款等外，这几年来还出现了一些社会主义各国之间所特有的新的合作形式。这种形式就是技术经济合作，国民经济计划的相互配合和生产的专业化、协作化，以及扩大原料基地时的投资互助，等等。
    苏联和欧洲各人民民主国家（包括德意志民主共和国在内）为了进行这种经济合作，专门成立了经济互助委员会。
    在经济互助委员会的参加国中，德意志民主共和国的工业占有重要的地位。原因在于，它的工业是高度发展的，既广泛而又集中。同时，德意志民主共和国的工业已有85％是属于社会主义成分的。德意志民主共和国的工业生产现在占社会总生产的58％。如果把建筑业、小型工业和手工业也包括在内，那么在社会总生产量中的比重就要高达70％，从业人员占国民经济全部工作人员的一半左右。在德意志民主共和国的工业企业中，从业人员共有二百八十万人。产业工人在全国人口中所占的比例在欧洲占第二位，仅次于英国。在苏联和欧洲各人民民主国家的工业职工总数中，德意志民主共和国的工业职工人数占十分之一左右。
    德意志民主共和国的电力生产是所有工业和经济部门整个现代化技术的基础。一个国家发电量的多少可以表明这个国家工业发展水平。1956年德意志民主共和国共生产了三百一十二亿瓩时的电力，在社会主义世界经济体系中占第二位，约等于苏联发电量的六分之一左右。在苏联、欧洲各人民民主国家和中国的总发电量中，德意志民主共和国约占12％。如果按人口平均计算，那么德意志民主共和国的电力产量在社会主义各国中将居于首位。德意志民主共和国平均每人可以摊到一千五百八十度电力，比苏联和东欧各国多一倍到五倍以上。
    然而，由于德意志民主共和国工业部门的结构，所生产的电力还不能满足需要。在德意志民主共和国工业各部门中占首位的是机器制造业，其次是产量占工业总产量18％的化学工业，另外是食品工业和纺织工业。而化学工业是电力的主要消费者。它所需要的电力占总发电量的三分之一以上。
    由于德国的分裂，在德意志民主共和国境内缺少硬煤和钢。即使是把储藏量丰富的褐煤矿都采完，也无法完全满足德意志民主共和国国民经济的需要。但尽管这样，德意志民主共和国的煤产量（折合成硬煤）按人口平均计算仍然达到每人三点八吨，和波兰人民共和国相等，占社会主义阵营的首位。
    过去几年中我国在钢的供应方面出现了特别的困难。1956年德意志民主共和国已经生产钢二百七十万吨，而1936年只有一百一十九万吨。但是这还不能满足机器制造业和其他经济部门的需要。1955年社会主义各国的钢产量按人口平均计算为：捷克斯洛伐克——三百五十公斤，苏联——二百三十二公斤，匈牙利——一百七十六公斤，波兰——一百七十公斤，德意志民主共和国——一百三十五公斤，罗马尼亚——五十公斤，保加利亚——二十八公斤，中国——六公斤。即使到1960年第二个五年计划完成后，德意志民主共和国钢产量平均每人为一百九十公斤左右，还大大低于捷克斯洛伐克和苏联的目前水平。苏联由于有利的生产条件将来也仍然是社会主义阵营中钢的主要供应者。
    在机器制造业方面，同苏联和捷克斯洛伐克一样，德意志民主共和国起着重要的作用。德意志民主共和国的机器制造业包括很多部门，主要都在共和国的南部地区。机器制造业各个部门的发展程度是不同的。在经济互助委员会中，德意志民主共和国1955年生产了11％的工作母机、33％的锻压设备、15％的冶金设备、80％的水泥设备、95％的露天采矿设备和100％的煤砖厂设备。
    在电力机械、起重运输机器、汽车和轮船、化学工业设备、仪器、印刷机器设备、轻工业和食品工业设备以及企业测量操纵设备的制造方面，德意志民主共和国在社会主义国家中占第二位。同时德意志民主共和国把20％以上的金属加工工业产品供应给各社会主义国家，大力地支援这些国家的社会主义工业化计划。德意志民主共和国是最大的机器设备输出者，因此能够向各人民民主国家提供贵重的机器设备和丰富的经验。它曾供应许多成套设备给社会主义阵营各国。
    在化学生产方面，德意志民主共和国在社会主义经济体系中也占第二位，仅次于苏联。德意志民主共和国化学工业的职工人数有二十四万人。化学工业的基地在德国中部地区。那里有许多蕴藏量丰富的褐煤矿、石灰矿、石膏矿、碳酸钾矿和盐矿，以及利用这些原料来生产的大型化学工厂。1956年德意志民主共和国化学工业在经济互助委员会各国中生产了9％的硫酸，21％的烧碱、25％的苛性钠、30％的氯气、23％的氮肥、62％的钾肥、56％的碳化钙和67％聚氯乙烯树脂。德意志民主共和国化学产品有17％是出口的；比起过去几年来，原料多于加工品。德意志民主共和国在其他社会主义国家建设本国的化学工业时给予了巨大的技术和科学援助。德意志民主共和国的专家经常在各社会主义国家帮助建设和实施新的生产方法。同样，各社会主义国家的专家也常常访问我国化学联合企业。
    在对外贸易方面，德意志民主共和国的贸易额占各人民民主国家的第二位。我们最大的贸易对象是苏联。1955年我国和苏联的贸易额达三十七亿五千一百万卢布，为我国整个对外贸易额的43％。输往苏联的有74.4％是机器设备，22％是原材料和燃料，1.6％是食品，1％是工业消费品。苏联则供给我们所需要的煤、焦煤、压延物资和有色金属等。1955年苏联供应给我国的货物有73.5％是原材料和燃料，25％是食品。1957年苏联和德意志民主共和国的换货量比1956年增加30％。
    同中华人民共和国的贸易，对德意志民主共和国的经济也有重要的作用。中国是世界上原料最丰富的国家之一，它将以矿砂、有色金属和其他重要原料供给我国。
    社会主义国家国民经济计划的协调配合，将有助于克服德意志民主共和国经济发展中的不平衡现象。另一方面，德意志民主共和国也通过提供机器设备和具有高度水平的技术援助，而对促进其他社会主义国家的经济发展作出贡献。这种平等互利的合作和真诚无私的相互帮助，是社会主义经济体系蓬勃发展和在最短历史时期内赶上和超过最发达的资本主义国家生产水平的重要因素。（附图片）
