    Labor models cannot be divorced from labor, just as fish cannot be separated from water
    The head of the cooperative can only lead the cooperative's production well by participating in production
    Wu Houli insists on participating in field labor
    The Rural Work Department of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China commends Wu Houli's exemplary behavior

    (Reported by this newspaper) According to the Shanxi Daily: Wu Houli, a famous agricultural labor model in Shanxi Province and director of the Hongxing Agricultural, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative in Yangjingdi Village, Pingshun County, has been commended by the Rural Work Department of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China for his exemplary behavior of insisting on participating in field labor for six years.
    Since the establishment of the Hongxing Cooperative in 1952, Wu Houli has served as the director of the cooperative. As the Hongxing Cooperative expanded from 23 households in 1952 to 206 households in 1957, his cooperative affairs became increasingly heavy. At the same time, he is also a representative of the Shanxi Provincial People's Congress, and spends more than three months each year attending meetings, visiting, and studying outside. He actually participates in cooperative work and labor production for only about 250 days. However, he has always insisted on participating in field labor, and the actual time spent on physical labor each year is more than 140 workdays. From January to mid-September this year, Wu Houli has already worked 120 workdays.
    Wu Houli's active participation in production has not affected his work in leading production. Under his leadership and the leadership of other cooperative cadres, the Hongxing Cooperative has achieved comprehensive bumper harvests in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline production for many years. The cooperative members unanimously praised Wu Houli as "taking the lead in work and being a model in labor."
    Wu Houli insists on participating in production because he realizes the importance of participating in physical field labor. He said, "We come from a laboring background and have won the honorary title of labor model. What kind of model is a labor model if he doesn't participate in labor!" He also said, "Moreover, I am now the director of the cooperative. If I don't participate in production and work with everyone, I won't be able to discover problems, and everyone won't tell you the truth, so I won't be able to lead production well." Therefore, Wu Houli actively works with the cooperative members, setting an example of hard work for everyone and paying attention to discovering and solving problems in production. His actions greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of the cooperative members for labor.
    For example, after the summer wheat harvest this year, it was necessary to seize the time to replant immediately. However, some cooperative members had the idea that they would not start until the rain had thoroughly soaked the soil. When Wu Houli discovered this situation, he explained to the cooperative members the principle that time waits for no one, and he worked with the old farmers to study the technology of planting in moisture-retaining soil. He also personally sowed 290 mu of land with a seed drill, enabling the cooperative to complete the replanting plan on schedule. For example, when plowing the land, he also found that although there was a specific quota for how much land could be plowed per workday, there was still a phenomenon of rushing to use mules and horses instead of oxen. He took the initiative to solicit the opinions of the cooperative members and learned that the reason for this situation was that using oxen to plow the land required more pulling power and could plow deeper, which was beneficial to increasing production, but oxen walked slowly. However, the cooperative did not differentiate between the use of different livestock and set quotas based on land classification, so some people felt that using oxen to plow the land was a disadvantage. He brought this issue to the cooperative management committee for discussion. Based on the conditions of land and livestock, the cooperative re-established a reasonable quota for plowing the land. As a result, the situation of not wanting to use oxen to plow the land was immediately reversed. When planting trees, the original quota was 150 trees per person, and some cooperative members complained that the quota was too high and they could not complete it. In order to find out whether this quota was too high, Wu Houli personally planted trees and planted 200 trees in one day. When the cooperative members saw this fact, they no longer complained that the quota was high and unanimously strived to plant more trees. Later, the quota was revised from 150 trees to 200 trees. The entire cooperative planted a total of 40,000 trees, saving 66 workdays compared to the original plan and increasing labor efficiency by 25%.
    Wu Houli discovers problems and solves problems in labor. He participates in labor and does work, and at the same time, he gains the support of the masses. He said: "Participating in labor is not an extra burden for the director of a cooperative, but a necessity for contacting the masses and doing a good job."
    The Hongxing Cooperative now has 8.9 times more members than at the beginning of its establishment. Wu Houli is able to squeeze out a lot of time to participate in field labor even when the cooperative affairs are becoming more and more busy, which is inseparable from the collective leadership role played by the cooperative management committee. The four directors and deputy directors of the cooperative have clear divisions of labor and are responsible for their respective duties. Wu Houli is the director and is responsible for overall work, focusing on forestry; there is a deputy director responsible for agriculture, animal husbandry, sideline production, and soil and water conservation. Each person has the right to handle general issues within their division of labor, and collective research is conducted on major issues involving the entire cooperative and issues involving several production teams (groups) that need to be resolved jointly. The cooperative also implemented a system of regular research work and rotational duty. This strengthened individual responsibility and the enthusiasm for actively solving problems, and through joint research, everyone was able to grasp the overall work and strengthen collective leadership. In addition, various meetings within the cooperative were also unified and controlled. Each major cadre in the cooperative can spare a certain amount of time to work in the fields without affecting cooperative affairs.
    Under the leadership of Wu Houli, the leadership cadres of the Hongxing Cooperative have now formed a system of participating in field labor, and the entire cooperative is filled with an atmosphere of unity and production.

    劳动模范不能脱离劳动如同鱼不能离开水
    社主任只有参加生产才能领导好全社生产
    武侯梨坚持参加田间劳动
    中共山西省委农村工作部通报表扬武侯梨的模范行为
    本报讯　据山西日报消息：山西省著名农业劳动模范、平顺县羊井底村红星农林牧生产合作社主任武侯梨，六年来坚持参加田间劳动的模范行为，受到中共山西省委农村工作部的通报表扬。
    从1952年红星社建社以来，武侯梨一直担任社主任职务。随着红星社由1952年的二十三户扩大到1957年的二百零六户，他所担负的社务工作日益繁重。同时，他还是山西省人民代表大会的代表，每年出外开会、参观和学习的时间都在三个月以上，实际参加社内工作和劳动生产的时间只有二百五十天左右。但是他始终如一地坚持参加田间劳动，每年实际参加体力劳动的时间在一百四十个劳动日以上。今年1月到9月中旬，武侯梨也已经做了一百二十个劳动日。
    武侯梨积极参加生产的行动，并没有影响到他领导生产的工作。在他和其他社干部的领导下，红星社连年来农林牧副业全面丰收。社员群众一致称赞武侯梨“工作带头干、劳动是模范”。
    武侯梨坚持参加生产，是由于他体会到参加田间体力劳动的重要意义。他说，“咱是劳动出身，又取得了劳动模范的光荣称号，一个劳动模范如果不参加劳动，还叫什么模范！”又说，“况且咱现在是社主任，要不参加生产和大家一块劳动，就发现不了问题，大家也不会给你讲实话，也就不能很好地领导生产”。因此，武侯梨积极和社员共同劳动，一面带头实干给大家做出榜样，一面注意发现和解决生产中的问题。他的行动大大鼓舞了社员的劳动积极性。
    例如今年夏季麦收后，要立即争取时间进行复播，但是，社员中存在不落透雨不动手的思想。武侯梨发现了这种思想情况，就向社员说明时间不等人的道理，并且和老农共同研究抢墒下种的技术，还亲自掌耧播种二百九十亩，使全社按期完成了复播计划。又如在耕地的时候，他又发现每个劳动日耕地多少，虽然有了具体定额，但是仍有抢着使用骡马、不用牛的现象。他主动征求了社员的意见，了解到产生这种情况的原因是：用牛耕地拉力大、能深耕，对增产有利，但牛走的慢，而社里不分使用什么牲口都按土地分类定额，有些人就认为使用牛耕地吃亏。他把这个问题提到社管理委员会研究。社里依据土地和牲口两项条件，重新规定了耕地的合理定额。这样，不愿使用牛耕地的情况，马上扭转过来。在栽树时，原规定每个定额栽一百五十株，部分社员喊叫定的太高完不成。为了实地摸清这个定额是否偏高，武侯梨亲自动手栽树，一天植了二百株。社员们看到这个事实，就不再叫喊定额高，一致争取多植树。后来定额由一百五十株修订为二百株。全社共植树四万株，比原来省工六十六个，提高劳动效率25％。
    武侯梨在劳动中发现问题解决问题，既参加了劳动，也做了工作，同时也就得到了群众的拥护。他说：“参加劳动在一个合作社主任来说不是额外负担，而是联系群众做好工作所必需的。”
    红星社现有社员比建社初期增加了八点九倍。武侯梨能够在社务逐年繁忙的情况下，挤出很多的时间参加田间劳动，是和社管理委员会发挥了集体领导作用分不开的。社里的四个正、副主任都有明确分工，各负其责。武侯梨是正主任，负责全面工作，重点搞林业；农业、牧畜副业、水土保持各有一个副主任负责。凡是在各人分工管理范围内的一般问题，各人都有权处理，凡是属于全社重大问题和涉及几个生产队（组）需共同解决的问题，就进行集体研究。社里并且实行了定期研究工作和轮流值日制度。这样，既加强了个人责任心和主动解决问题的积极性，又通过共同研究，每个人都能掌握全面工作，加强集体领导。此外，社内的各种会议也作了统一安排和控制。社内每个主要干部都能抽出一定时间下地劳动，而不致影响社务工作。
    在武侯梨的带动下，现在红星社的领导干部参加田间劳动已经形成制度，全社充满团结生产的气象。
