Youth Returns to Tongliu Cooperative
　　There are dozens of families in Xiajia Lake
　　Men and women with swollen bellies
　　Sons rarely find wives
　　Daughters cannot find mothers-in-law
This is a folk rhyme that circulated in the Tongliu Cooperative area of ​​Yangji Township, Hanchuan, Hubei before liberation. Xiajia Lake, mentioned in the rhyme, is a village in the Tongliu Cooperative.
Twenty years ago, more than ninety families lived here. Since the outbreak of schistosomiasis, in just over ten years, only twenty-six families remained due to deaths. Fields were barren and the scene was bleak.
In 1953, Hanchuan County established an institution for the prevention and treatment of schistosomiasis. Over the past few years, by adhering to comprehensive measures such as managing manure and water sources, eliminating snails, personal protection, and active treatment, Tongliu Cooperative has successively cured a number of patients. Now, in this village of less than six hundred people, one hundred and sixty-six patients have recovered their health.
The current Tongliu Cooperative not only has some happy and harmonious families, but women who had never been pregnant in the past now have children; those who could not marry in the past are now married. Moreover, great changes have also taken place in production. In the past, during the busy farming season, the attendance rate was at most 50%, but now it often remains above 90%. Recently, the attendance rate for drought resistance in the cooperative reached 100%. The cooperative's income has also increased rapidly as a result. Last year, the cooperative's total income for the whole year was more than 54,000 yuan, and this year it is estimated to reach more than 69,000 yuan.
The era of decline in Tongliu Cooperative is gone forever. Now circulating among the people are no longer those sad tunes, but songs full of optimism.
　　In the past, one could not move while sitting at home, but now one can do half a day's work.

    青春回到通流社
    夏家湖有几十家　　男男女女肚子大
    儿子难得接媳妇　　姑娘不能找婆家
    这是解放前流传在湖北汉川杨集乡通流社一带的一首歌谣。歌谣里所说的夏家湖，就是通流社里的一个村庄。
    二十年前，这里住着九十多户人家，自从流行血吸虫病以后，不过十多年的光景，就死得只剩下二十六户了。田园荒芜，一片凄凉。
    1953年，汉川县设立了防治血吸虫病的机构，几年来，由于坚持贯彻了管理粪便和水源，消灭钉螺，个人防护和积极治疗的综合措施，通流社陆续治愈了一批病人。现在，这不足六百人的村子里，已有一百六十六个病人恢复了健康。
    现在的通流社不仅出现了一些欢愉和睦的家庭，过去从未怀孕的妇女现在生了孩子；过去不能结婚的现在结了婚。而且在生产上也起了很大的变化。以前，在农忙时，出勤率最多不过50％，现在则经常保持90％以上，最近社里参加抗旱的出勤率达到100％。社里的收入也因此迅速增加了。去年社里全年总收入为五万四千多元，今年估计可达六万九千多元。
    通流社衰老的年代已一去不复返了。现在流传在人们口中的不再是那些悲凉的曲子，而是充满乐观情绪的歌谣。过去坐在家里不能动，现在一天能做个半工。
