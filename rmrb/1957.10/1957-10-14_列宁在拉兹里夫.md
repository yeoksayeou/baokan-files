　　Lenin in Razliv
　　En. A. Yemelyanov
    In July 1917, the Provisional Government suppressed the mass demonstrations and began large-scale massacres. On July 7, the Provisional Government ordered the arrest of Lenin, offering a reward of 200,000 gold rubles for his head. The Party hid its beloved leader in great secrecy. So, when cadets broke into Lenin's residence, he had already left. Lenin moved several times in two days. The task of the Party Central Committee was to hide Comrade Lenin in a safe and reliable place. Therefore, the Party Central Committee sent a representative to my home to discuss it with me. I felt very honored that the Party entrusted me with the task of hiding the revolutionary leader Comrade Lenin. I said, "I will certainly live up to the Party's trust in me."
    My yard was surrounded by various trees, and in the middle of the yard was an orchard. It was impossible to see what was happening in the yard from the street. My home was very conveniently located, not far from the railway, on a quiet street by the lake. This lake was connected to Lake Razliv by a small river. In case of emergency, one could take a small boat from the lake to Razliv and hide in the forest there. The forest was very dense and almost impassable.
    Part of this forest belonged to the landlord, and the other part belonged to the Tsarist government. There were some mowing fields on the shore of the lake. At that time, Finland had not yet seceded from Russia, and there was free movement across the border. During the summer mowing season, many Finnish farmers came to work as day laborers.
    At that time, we thought of hiding Lenin in the mowing field on the other side of Razliv, disguised as a Finnish day laborer hired by me. Finnish mowers often lived in the sheds in the mowing fields. At that time, it was decided to hide Comrade Lenin in such a shed.
    This plan was approved by the Party Central Committee. Comrade Lenin arrived on the evening of July 11. Stalin and Alliluyev accompanied him on foot to the New Village Station. I met them at the agreed location. It had been agreed in advance that we would take the last train to the villas to Razliv, which departed at two o'clock at night. I had already bought the tickets in advance. After receiving Comrade Lenin, I led him through the freight yard and into the carriage. We sat in the last carriage. Comrade Lenin stood on the handrail all the way so that he could jump down and hide immediately in case of danger. The first stop after New Village was Lakhta. After the train entered the station, I found that there were many people at the station. Unfortunately, the train stopped, and a group of drunken youths walked towards our carriage. I also pretended to be drunk and lay at the entrance of the carriage, wanting to prevent them from entering the carriage on the one hand and to see what kind of people they were on the other. I saw that these people were all dressed in plain clothes, but from their rude actions, I could tell that they were disguised soldiers. After a careful look at them, I knew from their conversation that they were young officers or cadets. They were all the most reactionary guys.
    When they saw me lying at the entrance, not letting them enter the carriage, they shouted and yelled and sat in the carriage in front, singing vulgar tunes and slandering Lenin. The situation was very dangerous for Lenin at that time. He was very likely to be recognized because his appearance had hardly changed.
    At this time, measures should be taken. I squeezed myself tighter at the door, holding the handrail with my hand. I thought, if they rushed in, I could block them so that Comrade Lenin could jump down. Those people continued to make noise in the carriage in front. One of the officers left his carriage and walked towards me. He looked me up and down, then turned his face and saw Lenin. He walked towards the handrail, bent down to look at Lenin's face. Comrade Lenin did not panic, he pretended to be very drunk. The officer wanted to see Lenin's face from the right, Lenin pulled the handrail and turned his face away. The officer wanted to see it from the left again, Lenin twisted his body and turned his face away again. In any case, he must not see Lenin's face. Finally, he waved his hand and said, "Anyway, he will fall down sooner or later." Then he went back to his carriage.
    The train pulled into Ol'gino station, and a few people got off. I thought the rest of the people might be going to the Sestroretsk Sanatorium, so I decided to get off with Comrade Lenin at the next station, Razdelnaya.
    The officers were arguing about something in the carriage. I paid attention to listening to their conversation. From the conversation, I knew that they would get off at Razdelnaya Station.
    We were ready. If they did not get off at Razdelnaya, we would get off. If they got off, we would go to Razliv. After the train arrived at Razdelnaya, all the officers got off. Comrade Lenin and I arrived at Razliv safely. ×××
    We arrived at Razliv nearly three o'clock at night. After Comrade Lenin came to my house, he greeted everyone. He was a little uneasy about the number of children in my family: I had seven children in total, the oldest was seventeen years old and had become a Communist Party member, and the youngest was only two and a half years old. Comrade Lenin said to my wife, "Please keep it absolutely secret! No one, whether relatives, friends, or local party committee members, can reveal that a stranger has come to your home."
    My wife said, "Vladimir Ilyich, we have done many important tasks and completed many tasks entrusted by the Party. We have not failed in any of them. We will keep our mouths shut."
    Comrade Lenin decided to live in the attic above the kitchen. A bed and a table, and two chairs were arranged for him on the haystack. The weather in July 1917 was very hot, and the attic was very stuffy. The light was very poor. Sunlight could only shine in from the cracks. Even in such an environment, Comrade Lenin did not interrupt his great creative activities. From here, he continued to lead the work of the Party Central Committee and wrote the article "On Slogans" and a letter to the editorial department of "The Cause of the Proletariat."
    Lenin did not hide in the attic all day. Sometimes he took a walk in the garden. Once, while Lenin was walking, he heard a noise. It turned out that the children had found a small oak tree when they went to the forest to collect wild fruits, and they brought it back and wanted to plant it in the garden. I began to scold them, because planting trees in July would not survive at all. Lenin loved children very much. He said that it could be planted to try. The children brought shovels, dug a pit, and Lenin planted the oak tree. Later, this oak tree survived and still grows in the garden.
    Lenin's close comrades-in-arms Sverdlov, Ordzhonikidze, Molotov, Stalin, and Dzerzhinsky all came here. Lenin led the work of the Bolshevik Party through them.
    After the shed was ready, Lenin shaved his beard, put on Finnish peasant clothes, and took a small boat with me to Lake Razliv to cut grass. During Lenin's stay in the shed, the shed became a secret meeting place. I always lived with Lenin in the shed, leaving my wife at home as a liaison. A call sign was agreed upon. She greeted comrades according to the call sign and then crossed over to the Razliv Lake with the older children.
    After Lenin came to Razliv, he immediately asked us to provide him with all the newspapers published at that time every day. This task was handed over to my wife. In order to avoid suspicion, she only bought one newspaper, and the rest were bought by the children. But because everyone in Razliv knew us, it was very likely to make people notice why we suddenly bought newspapers, so we let our children buy them in places far away from home. In addition to delivering newspapers, my wife also prepared lunch for us and sent it across the lake.
    After Comrade Lenin looked at the shed, he immediately chose his work place. I suggested that he work in the jungle. I found a large jungle, cleared a space in the center, erected two tree stumps, a higher one as a "table" and a smaller one as a chair, and surrounded it with tree branches. Comrade Lenin could work quietly. From the first day he came here, he began to write his brilliant work: "State and Revolution."
    Comrade Lenin got up very early, washed his face, and went to the jungle to work. He often joked, "Go to my green office to work."
    My thirteen-year-old child, Kolya, was also with us on the mowing field. He collected branches every day and lit a bonfire to make tea. His main task was to guard the surroundings. When he saw strangers, he would whistle so that we could be prepared. If it was our own people coming, he would imitate the call of an oriole so that we could go to greet them.
    The next day, the first to come was Comrade Ordzhonikidze. I came back from mowing the grass in the morning (not much mowing, it was just to cover up others' eyes and ears), and suddenly I heard the call of an oriole. I immediately knew that our own people were coming. I saw Ordzhonikidze led by my eldest son Kondraty walking over. When he reached the open space, he saw Comrade Lenin walking out of the shed wearing a wig. He greeted Comrade Ordzhonikidze. Ordzhonikidze stopped a few steps away from him, turned his head in surprise and wanted to ask me something. I had already guessed that he did not recognize Lenin. At this time, Lenin said:
    "Comrade Sergo (Note)!"
    Only then did Sergo recognize Lenin. Later, we laughed endlessly when we talked about this matter.
    During this period, Comrade Lenin worked all day and always sat in his "green office." The only rest was helping me cut grass. Although it was very dangerous for Lenin at this time, Comrade Lenin was always happy and often told jokes.
    The mowing season has passed, and it is cold to live in the shed. The Party Central Committee decided to find a way to send Comrade Lenin to Finland.
    Comrade Lenin stayed in the shed until August 21.
    On the day of his departure, we cleaned the shed and transported the things to our home.
    After Lenin left the shed, he went to Finland. I got him a pass in the name of Ivanov, a worker at the Sestroretsk Arsenal. Comrade Lenin left us by train disguised as a stoker. After crossing the Finnish border, he first lived in the village of Jalkala and later moved to Helsinki.
    Late at night on October 24, 1917, Comrade Lenin came to the Smolny Palace to directly lead the armed uprising. I only saw him for a moment and did not have time to speak. On the morning of the 25th, all the important institutions of the capital—the telephone bureau, telegraph bureau, radio station, Neva Bridge, and railway station—were occupied by the insurgent workers and soldiers.
    The great October Socialist Revolution was victorious in our country under the leadership of Lenin and the Bolshevik Party.

　　列宁在拉兹里夫
　　恩·阿·叶米里扬诺夫
    1917年7月临时政府镇压了群众的游行，开始了大规模的屠杀。7月7日，临时政府下令逮捕列宁。悬赏二十万金卢布购取列宁的头颅。党把自己敬爱的领袖极秘密地隐藏起来了。所以，当士官生闯入列宁的住宅时，他已经离开那里。列宁在两天内迁移数次。党中央的任务是要把列宁同志藏在安全可靠的地方。于是党中央派代表来到我家同我商量。我对党给我以掩藏革命领袖列宁同志的任务感到非常光荣。我说：“我一定不辜负党对我的信任。”
    我家的院子周围长满了各种树木，在院子中间是个果园，从街上根本看不见院子里在做什么。我家的地点非常方便，离铁路不远，在湖边一条寂静的街道上。这个湖有条小河同拉兹里夫湖相连，如果有什么紧急情况，就可以从湖边乘小船划到拉兹里夫，到那边的森林里去躲避。那里的森林长得很密，而且几乎没有道路可通。
    这森林的一部分属于地主，另一部分是沙皇政府的。湖岸有一些刈草场。那时芬兰还没有脱离俄国，边界上可以自由来往，在夏季刈草期间有许多芬兰农民来当短工。
    那时我们就想到把列宁隐藏在拉兹里夫那面的刈草场，扮成是我雇来的芬兰短工。芬兰刈草工经常是住在刈草场的草棚子里。当时就决定把列宁同志也隐藏在这样的草棚子里。
    这个计划在党中央通过了。列宁同志是在7月11日晚间来的。斯大林和阿利路也夫陪同步行来到新村车站。我在约定的地点接到了他们。事先已经约好，我们坐到别墅去的最后一次列车到拉兹里夫去，火车是在夜里两点开车。事先我已买好了车票，接到列宁同志以后，我领着他通过货站，走进车厢。我们坐在最后一个车厢上，列宁同志一路都站在扶手梯上，以便遇到危险的时候，马上可以跳下去隐藏起来。新村后的第一站是拉赫达，火车进站以后我发现车站上的人很多。事不凑巧，车停了下来，有一群喝得醉熏熏的青年人向我们车厢走来。我也假装喝醉了，躺在车厢入口，一方面想阻碍他们进入车厢，另一方面想看一看到底是些什么人。我看到这群人都穿着便衣，但从他们的粗暴的动作中可以知道他们是些化装的军人。仔细看过他们以后，从他们的谈话中知道，是些青年军官或者是士官生。都是些最反动的家伙。
    当他们看到我躺在入口不让他们进入车厢以后，他们连喊带嚷地坐到前面的车厢上，唱起无聊的小调，还诬蔑列宁。当时的情况对列宁是非常危险的，他很可能被认出来，因为他的外貌几乎没有改变。
    这时应当采取办法。我更紧地挤在门口，用手握住扶手。我想，如果他们强冲，我可以挡一挡，以便列宁同志跳下去。那些人在前边的那个车厢里继续吵闹着，其中有个军官离开自己的车厢走到我面前，他把我端详了一下，然后转过脸去看到了列宁。他向扶梯走去。弯下腰去看列宁的面孔，列宁同志并没有惊惶，他装成大醉的样子。军官想从右边看列宁的面孔，列宁拉着扶手转过脸去，军官又想从左边去看，列宁身子一扭，又把脸转开。不管怎样他绝不能看到列宁的面孔。最后他一摆手说：“反正早晚要摔下去。”就走回了自己的车厢。
    火车开进奥尔金诺站，有几个人下去了。我想其余的人可能是去歇斯特罗列茨克休养所的，因此决定同列宁同志在下一站拉兹捷尔那亚下车。
    军官们在车厢里争论着什么。我注意倾听他们的谈话，从谈话中知道他们将在拉兹捷尔那亚站下车。
    我们准备好了，如果他们在拉兹捷尔那亚不下车，我们就下去，如果他们下，我们就坐到拉兹里夫去。车到拉兹捷尔那亚以后，所有的军官全下去了，我和列宁同志安安稳稳地到了拉兹里夫。×××
    我们来到拉兹里夫已经将近夜里三点钟。列宁同志来到我家以后向每个人问了好。我家孩子之多使他有些不放心：我一共有七个孩子，最大的十七岁，已经成了共产党员，最小的一个才两岁半。列宁同志向我妻子说：“请保持绝对的秘密！任何人，不论是亲戚朋友或地方党组织委员都不能泄露出你家来了一个生人。”
    我的妻子说：“弗拉基米尔·伊里奇，我们做过许多要紧的工作，完成过许多党的委托，任何一项工作我们都没有失败过。我们会守口如瓶。”
    列宁同志决定住在厨房上面的暗楼上。在草堆上为他安置了一个床位和一张桌子，两把椅子。1917年7月天气很热，暗楼里非常闷人，光线很不好，阳光只能从隙缝中射进来。即使在这样的环境下，列宁同志也没有中断过自己的巨大创作活动。从这里他继续领导了党中央的工作，写成了“论口号”的文章和致“无产阶级事业”编辑部的信。
    列宁并没有成天躲在暗楼里面，有时候他也到园中散步。有一次列宁在散步时听到了吵闹声，原来是孩子们到森林中采集野果时找到了一棵小橡树，把它带回来，想种到园子里。我开始斥责他们，因为在7月里种树根本活不了。列宁很爱小孩子，他说可以种上试试看。孩子们拿来铁锹，挖了一个坑，列宁把橡树种了下去。后来这橡树活了，到现在还长在园中。
    列宁的亲近战友斯维尔德洛夫、奥尔忠尼启则、莫洛托夫、斯大林、捷尔任斯基都到过这里，列宁通过他们领导布尔什维克党的工作。
    当草棚准备好以后，列宁剃去胡须，穿着芬兰农民式的衣服，坐上小船同我一起渡到拉兹里夫湖去割草。在列宁住在草棚里的时候，这草棚就成了秘密集会的地方。我始终同列宁一起住在草棚里，家里留下我的妻子作联系人。约定了呼号，她按呼号迎接同志，然后同大孩子一起渡到拉兹里夫湖这边来。
    列宁来到拉兹里夫以后马上就要我们每天供给他当时出版的所有报纸，这个任务交给了我的妻子。为了免得引起怀疑，她只买一份报纸，其余的交给孩子们去买。但是因为在拉兹里夫全认识我们，很可能使人注意到为什么我们忽然买起报纸来，因此，就让我们的孩子到离家较远的地方去买。妻子除了送报以外还为我们准备午饭送过湖来。
    列宁同志把草棚看了一下以后，立刻选择自己的工作地点。我建议他在丛林里工作。我找到一个大的丛林，在中央辟出一块空地，立下两个树墩，一个较高的做为“桌子”，另外一个小的做为椅子，周围用树枝围了起来，列宁同志可以安安静静地工作。他从来到这里第一天起就开始写自己天才的作品：“国家与革命”。
    列宁同志起得很早，洗完脸以后就到丛林里去工作，他常玩笑地说：“到我的绿色办公室去办公。”
    在刈草场上和我们在一起的还有我的十三岁的孩子科里亚。他每天搜集树枝，燃起篝火烧茶。他主要的任务是看守四周，看到生人时就吹个口哨，以便使我们有所准备，如果是自己人来，就学个莺叫，以便我们去迎接。
    第二天，最先来的是奥尔忠尼启则同志。早晨我割草回来（割的不多，这只不过是为了掩盖别人的耳目而已），忽然听到莺叫，我马上知道有自己人来了。我看到了奥尔忠尼启则由我的大儿子康德拉基领着走来走到空地时看见列宁同志戴着假发走出草棚，他向奥尔忠尼启则同志问好。奥尔忠尼启则离他没有几步忽然停下来，惊讶地回过头要问我什么，我已经猜到他没认出列宁来。这时列宁说：
    “谢尔郭（注）同志！”
    这时谢尔郭才认出列宁来。后来我们一谈起这件事来就大笑不止。
    在这段期间列宁同志整天工作，始终坐在自己的“绿色办公室”里。唯一的休息是帮助我割草。在这时对列宁说来虽然非常危险，但列宁同志始终是愉快的，并且常常说笑话。
    割草期过去了，住在草棚里已经冷了，党中央决定设法把列宁同志送往芬兰。
    列宁同志在草棚里住到8月21日。
    在临走这一天，我们把草棚打扫好，把东西运到家里去。
    列宁离开草棚后到芬兰去了。我用歇斯特罗列茨克兵工厂工人伊万诺夫的名字给他弄到了一张通行证。列宁同志是装成一个司炉坐上火车离开我们的。过了芬兰边境，起初住在雅尔卡拉村，后来搬到赫尔辛福斯（赫尔辛基）。
    1917年10月24日深夜，列宁同志来到斯莫尔尼宫直接领导武装起义。我只看到他一眼，没有来得及说话。在25日早晨，首都的一切重要机关——电话局、电报局、无线电台、湼瓦大桥、火车站——都被起义的工人和士兵占领了。
    伟大的十月社会主义革命在列宁和布尔什维克党的领导下在我国胜利了。
