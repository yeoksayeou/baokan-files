    She Blushed
    Before National Day, the school organized a voluntary labor activity. Xiao Yun, standing in the corridor, holding a brush, wiped the sweat from her face and said, "It's really tiring. I can't even drag it." She looked at her hands, which were covered in purple blisters.
    By chance, a veteran worker heard this. He approached Xiao Yun and said with a smile, "You don't do manual labor often!" After saying that, he took the brush and started wiping.
    Xiao Yun admired the veteran worker's vigor. She also thought about how the veteran worker had to wipe it every day, which was really hard work. Suddenly, she thought about how she used to throw waste paper on the ground, and she blushed...
    She hurriedly took the brush back from the veteran worker and started wiping it, stroke by stroke.

    她脸红了
    国庆前夕学校组织了一次义务劳动。小云站在走廊扶着刷子，擦着脸上汗说：“真累。拖也拖不动。”她看看手，手上起了紫泡。
    巧。这句话被工友老大爷听见了。他走近小云身边笑着说：“不常干活啊”！说完接过刷子，挥动手臂擦起来了。
    小云看着工友老大爷的那股劲，暗暗佩服。她又想到工友老大爷每天都要擦一次，真够辛苦了。忽然，她想到自己过去好往地下扔碎纸的事，脸红了……
    她急忙从工友老大爷手中接回刷子一下一下的擦起来。
