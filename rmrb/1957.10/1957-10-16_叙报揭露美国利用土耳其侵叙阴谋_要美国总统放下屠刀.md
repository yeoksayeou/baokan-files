Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, October 14th (TASS) - "Al-Jamahir" newspaper editor Kaddah, in an open letter to US President Eisenhower, stated that the US-orchestrated plan to attack Syria has been finalized. He said, "On behalf of all Arab patriots, I denounce the US government, the main instigator and organizer of the criminal conspiracy against the Syrian people."

The open letter, published in "Al-Jamahir," recounted the activities of US Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Henderson in Istanbul, Turkey. The letter said that Henderson discussed with representatives from Turkey, Iraq, and Jordan a plan to attack Syria, which was formulated by the Turkish General Staff in conjunction with US military experts. The finalized plan stipulates that Turkish troops will occupy Aleppo and Latakia, and the US Sixth Fleet will enter the port of Latakia and land troops to occupy Homs and Damascus.

Furthermore, it has been learned that Turkish infantry and armored tank units are being transferred from Izmir, Manisa, Bursa, Balikesir, Ankara, Erzurum, and other cities to gather at the Syrian border. For example, it has been learned that the artillery regiment of the Turkish Sixth Division is being transferred from Balikesir, and the artillery regiment of the Fifty-seventh Division is being transferred from Manisa.

The letter continued, "American officers and generals are inspecting Turkish troops stationed on the northern border of Syria, and are instructing them on how to attack Syria." Henderson also promised Turkish Prime Minister Menderes that the United States would immediately provide economic assistance as long as Turkey attacked Syria.

The letter pointed out that the US "denial" of Khrushchev's claim that the US participated in plotting aggression against Syria is a sophistry.

Kaddah concluded by writing: "Mr. President, I have told you all these facts in the hope of awakening your conscience. I believe you will openly tell the world that the purpose of your plan to fill the 'vacuum' in the Arab East is to stop the Arab nationalist movement striving for freedom and independence. We fervently call on you to abandon this disastrous policy that has aroused the indignation of the Arab people against the United States."

    叙报揭露美国利用土耳其侵叙阴谋
    要美国总统放下屠刀
    新华社15日讯　据塔斯社大马士革14日讯：“群众报”编辑卡丹在给美国总统艾森豪威尔的一封公开信中说，美国策动的进攻叙利亚的计划已经制定好了。他说，我代表阿拉伯的一切爱国者控诉反对叙利亚人民的罪恶阴谋的主要唆使者和组织者——美国政府。
    刊载在“群众报”上的这封公开信，追述了美国副国务卿帮办汉德逊在土耳其伊斯坦布尔的活动。信中说，汉德逊同土耳其、伊拉克和约旦的代表们商谈了由土耳其军参谋部会同美国军事专家制定进攻叙利亚的计划。制定的计划规定土耳其军队占领阿勒颇和拉塔基亚，美国第六舰队开入拉塔基亚港并登陆占领霍姆斯和大马士革。
    此外，还获悉从伊兹密尔、马尼萨、布尔萨、巴利开息尔、安卡拉、埃尔佐和其他城市调动土耳其步兵部队和装甲坦克部队向叙利亚边境集结。例如，已经获悉，土耳其第六师炮兵团从巴利开息尔进行调动，第五十七师炮兵团从马尼萨进行调动。
    信中又说：“美国的军官和将军正在视察位于叙利亚北部边境的土耳其军队，并且指示它们如何进攻叙利亚。”汉德逊还曾经答应土耳其总理曼德列斯，只要土耳其进攻叙利亚，美国就立即提供经济援助。
    信中指出，美国“否认”赫鲁晓夫所说的美国参预策划对叙利亚的侵略，这是一种狡辩。
    卡丹最后写道：“总统先生，我向您讲述了这一切事实，希望唤醒您的良心，我相信，您会公开告诉全世界，您的填补阿拉伯东方‘真空’的计划的目的是要制止争取自由和独立的阿拉伯民族主义运动。我们热烈地呼吁您放弃这一引起阿拉伯人民对美国愤慨的灾难政策。”
