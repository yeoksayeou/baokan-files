Guangzhou youth reclamation teams, since arriving on Hainan Island at the beginning of this year, have established ten agricultural production cooperatives. Now more than 1,200 people have settled down on Hainan Island, and it is estimated that most farms and agricultural cooperatives can be self-sufficient this year and will no longer need state loans.

Last year, Hainan Island suffered a drought, and the reclamation team members persisted in reclaiming wasteland under difficult conditions. They carried water day and night up slopes as high as a five-story building. Thanks to their hard work, they finally grew nearly 400,000 jin of rice and various cash crops on the newly reclaimed land. They also raised more than 2,200 heads of cattle, sheep, and pigs, and more than 1,400 poultry; and established small-scale citronella processing plants, brick and tile factories, brewing factories, tofu workshops, etc. It is estimated that the total income this year will reach 290,000 yuan. In the future, they also plan to plant cash crops such as rubber, coffee, oil palm, pepper, and sisal.

In the practice of actual production, the land reclamation youths have improved their class consciousness, and some have joined the Communist Party and the Communist Youth League.

    在海南岛垦荒的广州青年
    经过艰苦劳动今年可以自给自足
    本报讯  广州青年垦荒队自本年初到达海南岛以后，分别成立了十个农业生产合作社。现在已有一千二百多人在海南岛上安居下来，估计今年大部分农庄和农业社可以自给自足，不再需要国家贷款。
    去年海南岛天旱，垦荒队员们在困难条件下坚持开垦荒地。他们曾日夜不停地把水担上五层楼那么高的坡地上。由于艰苦的劳动，终于在新开荒地上种出了近四十万斤稻谷和各种经济作物。还饲养了牛、羊、猪二千二百多头，家禽一千四百多只；建立了小型的香茅加工厂、砖瓦厂、酿配厂、豆腐场等，估计今年总收入将达二十九万元。今后还计划种植橡胶、咖啡、油棕、胡椒、剑麻等经济作物。
    垦荒青年们在实际生产的锻炼中，提高了阶级觉悟，部分人参加了共产党和共青团。
