    China-Czechoslovakia Tennis Teams Clash Twice
    Czech Team Defeats Our National Team Again the Day Before Yesterday
    (Our newspaper dispatch) The Czechoslovakian tennis team, which was invited to visit our country, held a friendly match against our national team on the afternoon of the 3rd. In the four matches of men's and women's singles and men's doubles, the visiting team won all of them.
    The men's doubles was a tense and exciting performance. The Czech team's outstanding players Jaworski Ili and the Czech Junior runner-up Meronka Odakar took the court, and the Chinese team responded with Zhu Zhenhua and Wu Shengkang (national tennis singles second and third place). At the start of the match, both sides strived to volley at the net, forming a close-quarters battle. In the first set, Jaworski constantly used clever and accurate shots to strike the opponent's openings, coupled with Meronka's fierce smashes at the net, forcing Zhu and Wu to run back and forth to save dangerous balls, resulting in a 2-0 victory.
    In the women's singles, Czech national runner-up Dvorachkova defeated our national runner-up Lu Lu with a score of 2-1. In the two men's singles matches, Meronka defeated Wu Shengkang 2-0. Czech national runner-up Kraicik defeated our national champion Mei Fuji 2-0.
    Before this match, the two sides held a friendly match of four pairs of men's and women's singles and men's doubles on the 2nd, and the Czech team won all of them. (Guo An)

    中捷网球队两次交锋
    捷队前日再胜我国家队
    本报讯　应邀来我国访问的捷克斯洛伐克网球队3日下午对我国国家队举行了一场友谊比赛，在男、女单打和男子双打的四对比赛中，客队全部获胜。
    男子双打是一场紧张而又精彩的表演。捷队出色选手雅沃尔斯基·依利和全捷少年亚军麦龙卡·奥达卡尔上场，中国队以朱振华、吴生康（全国网球单打第二、三名）应战。比赛开始，双方都争取上网拦击，形成了短兵相接的局面，在第一盘中。雅沃尔斯基不断以机智、准确的抽球抽击对方的空挡，再加上麦龙卡的网前猛扣，迫使朱、吴来回奔跑抢救险球，结果以二比零获胜。
    在女子单打中，捷全国亚军德沃拉契科娃以二比一胜我国亚军卢璐。在两场男子单打中麦龙卡以二比零胜吴生康。捷全国亚军克拉依契克以二比零胜我国冠军梅福基。
    在这场比赛前，双方曾在2日举行了一场四对的男、女单打和男子双打的友谊比赛，结果捷队全都告捷。（国安）
