Xinhua News Agency report: In the movement to resist drought by irrigating and planting wheat, a few farmers in Laiyang, Wendeng, and other counties in Shandong Province who persisted in individual farming have conceded defeat to the agricultural cooperatives in the face of their inability to plant wheat. Currently, over 54 million mu of wheat have been planted throughout the province, completing 85.7% of the wheat planting plan. Those who are still unable to plant wheat are individual farmers, who are anxiously seeking to join cooperatives. To this end, the Party and People's Committee of Laiyang and other places have issued notices, calling on agricultural cooperatives in various places to help individual farmers plant wheat in the spirit of socialist mutual assistance.

Shandong has suffered from severe drought since autumn. By September, when wheat should have been planted, some land was already dry and parched. At that time, various localities criticized the idea of waiting for rain and launched agricultural cooperatives to seize the opportunity to plant wheat in moist soil. By mid-to-late September, the province still had no rain, and irrigation and wheat planting had to be carried out. By early October, the province reached a climax in irrigation and wheat planting. Carrying water to plant wheat is very hard work. It often takes a thousand loads of water to irrigate one mu of wheat field, and dozens of loads of water are needed to plant wheat along the ditches. The further away from the water source, the harder it is, but the hardship does not scare the collective farmers. They went to work as early as 3:00 in the morning and did not finish until 11:00 or 12:00 at night. After about a month of intensive work, they finally planted most of the wheat fields.

In Huang County, Laiyang Prefecture, agricultural cooperatives came up with more than a dozen methods in the irrigation and wheat planting movement, using all available water sources. This time, the county also repaired many old wells, dug more than a thousand new wells, excavated many water cellars, and intercepted all rivers with water. The Mingxing Agricultural Cooperative in Duixu Township had 300 mu of upland fields separated to the west of a dry riverbed, and it was impossible to irrigate them from the wells east of the river. The members laid a sod aqueduct across the dry riverbed to draw water across the river, and then used waterwheels and windlasses to pump the water up the slope level by level. In Huang County, there were many cases of diverting water through mountains and over mountains for wheat planting this time.

At present, most of the wheat that has been planted in various places has already emerged. Some agricultural cooperatives in Laiyang, Wendeng, Rongcheng and other counties, which have basically completed wheat planting, are still striving to plant more. Many areas have launched campaigns to check the fields and replant seedlings, and to kill locusts and irrigate to protect seedlings. Many agricultural cooperatives in Huang County and other places have planted "standby" wheat seedlings in preparation for replanting.

At present, individual farmers in various places have planted very little wheat, or even none at all. Lu Yuezhen, a wealthy middle peasant in Kaijia Shui Village, Laiyang County, who had said she would "not participate in agricultural cooperatives for five years," has now taken the initiative to request to join the cooperative. Laiyang County has already absorbed 350 individual farmers into cooperatives. These households have also planted wheat after joining the cooperative.

### 山东省农民依靠集体力量  浇水种麦战胜旱象  一些单干农民在旱灾面前束手无策纷纷要求入社

    山东省农民依靠集体力量
    浇水种麦战胜旱象
    一些单干农民在旱灾面前束手无策纷纷要求入社
    据新华社讯　在抗旱浇水种麦的运动中，山东省莱阳、文登等县的少数坚持单干的农民，在种不上麦子的事实面前纷纷向农业社认输了。现在全省种麦已达五千四百多万亩，完成种麦计划85.7％。现在还种不上麦子的都是单干农民，他们急得像热锅上的蚂蚁，纷纷要求入社，为此莱阳等地的党和人民委员会已发出通知，号召各地农业社本着社会主义互助的精神，帮助单干农民种麦。
    山东入秋苦旱，到9月份应该种麦时已经有些地干土燥。当时各地就批判了等雨的想法发动农业社抢墒种麦。到9月中下旬全省仍然无雨，不得不进行浇水种麦。到10月上旬，全省浇水种麦达到高潮。担水种麦是非常艰苦的劳动，泼一亩麦地往往需千把担水，顺沟点水种麦也需几十担水。越种距水越远也就越艰苦，但是艰苦吓不倒集体农民，他们早上三点钟就出工，深夜十一、二时才收工。经过一个月左右的突击，终于把大部分麦田种上了。
    莱阳专区黄县在浇水种麦运动中，农业社就想出了十几种办法，把一切水源都用上了。这次，这个县又修复了很多旧井，打了一千多眼新井，挖了很多水窖，拦截了一切有水的河流。碓徐家乡明星农业社有三百亩岗地隔在干河滩西，河东有井浇不上。社员们就在干河滩上用草泥横铺了一条水渠把水引过了河，又用水车和辘轳一级一级地把水抽上了坡。在黄县，这次种麦中穿山引水和翻山引水的事都很多。
    现在，各地已种的麦子大部已经出苗，已经大体完成种麦的掖县、文登、荣成等县，有的农业社还在争取多种一些。不少地区已经发动查田补苗和打蚂蚱、浇水保苗。黄县等地不少农业社种有准备补苗的“听差”麦苗。
    现在各地单干农民种麦很少，甚至一亩未种。莱阳县开家水村富裕中农吕月珍说过“五年内不参加农业社”，现在主动向农业社要求入社。莱阳县已经吸收了三百五十户单干农民入社。这些户入社后也都种上了麦。
