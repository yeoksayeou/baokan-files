　　Snowy day.
　　Around 1:00 AM, I rushed to the Hongliushan exploration area, over sixty miles away from the oil field. The well site was a scene of bustling activity. Drilling workers were moving barite powder back and forth. I glanced at the workers, but didn't see Captain Zhu Wenqing.
　　"Have you seen the captain?" I asked, stopping a worker.
　　"He just went over there, see, by the pile of barite powder." The worker pointed. I walked in the direction he indicated. There were three or four people there, but still no sign of Zhu Wenqing. I was getting a little impatient and had to ask another worker, "Where did your captain go?"
　　"Oh! Are you Engineer Jiang Lin?" A young man bending over, preparing to carry a bag of barite powder, slightly raised his head. His face was covered in crude oil, glistening in the light. If it weren't for his voice, I wouldn't have recognized him as Zhu Wenqing. Before I could answer, he continued, "It gushed again for a while just now, really powerful, shot up over ten meters high." Zhu Wenqing gestured excitedly, then wiped his face with his hand, brought it to his nose, and took a greedy, forceful sniff: "Hey! The smell is strong enough, must be top-grade crude oil." Then Zhu Wenqing shouldered a bag of barite powder and led me to the mud pit. He picked up a stick and stirred it in the mud pit: "Look, all the stuff floating on top is crude oil, and it's frozen into chunks now. You know, the weather is really terrible now, it drops to below minus thirty degrees in an instant." Indeed, it was crude oil, not only in the mud pit, but also overflowing outside, flowing down the gully, creating a small black channel that stretched over a hundred meters on the vast snowfield.
　　"Hurry up and scoop the crude oil out of the mud pit, don't reduce the mud weight, or the oil will gush up again in a while," I reminded Zhu Wenqing. Upon hearing this, he quickly found an iron bucket and bent down to scoop the crude oil floating on the mud.
　　"Old Zhu, let the workers scoop it! You're the captain, you should take care of everything!" Seeing Zhu Wenqing's difficult situation, I knew he was exhausted. I remembered that ever since this well had a stuck drill, Zhu Wenqing had been staying at the well day and night, personally troubleshooting the accident. It wasn't until after 9:00 PM last night that the accident was resolved. He had originally planned to go back to the mine at 12:00 AM when the transport vehicle came, but unexpectedly, only two hours later, the oil gushed out. Now, he hadn't slept for six whole days. I deliberately wanted him to rest for a while.
　　"Oh!" Zhu Wenqing hesitated for a moment, but when he looked at the workers, he quickly changed his mind and said, "They still have to carry barite, they're busy, I'll do it!" So he continued to scoop the crude oil. I couldn't help but walk over and help him lift the oil bucket and pour it outside the machine room. After carrying only a few buckets of crude oil, the mud pit became very slippery because it was covered with mud and crude oil. Zhu Wenqing slipped into the mud pit without noticing. The mud submerged Zhu Wenqing's waist, and there were ice shards in the mud, freezing Zhu Wenqing so that he shivered several times.
　　"Well, this is more convenient, Old Jiang, you come here and take it!" Zhu Wenqing calmed himself and then said indifferently.
　　"Hurry up and get out, or you'll freeze to death in a while!" I said almost commandingly. I took the opportunity to grab his hand and pull him up while taking the oil bucket. At this moment, a gust of cold wind blew, causing Zhu Wenqing to shiver violently, and his teeth chattered incessantly.
　　"I really didn't feel cold just now," Zhu Wenqing said, seemingly still unwilling to admit defeat.
　　Anyway, I pulled Zhu Wenqing back to the tent and made him change into the technician's cotton pants. He draped an old sheepskin coat over himself and sat down by the blazing stove. Only then did he slowly report the well's gushing situation to me. Not long after, he leaned against the wall and fell fast asleep.
　　I didn't disturb him, but silently recalled that for more than half a year, I had personally witnessed these drilling workers going back and forth from the mine to work here three times a day, and then returning to the mine after work, always traveling over a hundred miles each day. That's not all, the worst thing was that the car sometimes broke down on the road. At this time, Zhu Wenqing would lead everyone, singing "We Workers Have Strength," to climb over steep snowy hillsides and run to the well site to continue working.
　　After a while, I suddenly heard a commotion outside, thinking that the oil had gushed up again, so I got up to go outside, preparing to greet everyone at the well site. Unexpectedly, just as I was about to leave the tent, I stepped on a piece of iron plate and woke Zhu Wenqing. He suddenly sat up: "What? Is it gushing again?" It seemed as if he had anticipated it beforehand.
　　"Well, probably!" I said, suddenly remembering that he hadn't rested well, so I pressed him down and persuaded him: "It's okay, you sleep, I'll take care of it."
　　"No, I don't want to sleep anymore." Zhu Wenqing draped the old sheepskin coat over himself and jumped and ran out again. I wanted to chase after him and pull him back, but he had already run far away.

    喷油之夜
    仲强
    风雪天。
    午夜一点多的时候，我赶到离油矿有六十多里远的红柳山探区。井场上，正是一片繁忙的景象。钻井工人们来来往往地在搬运重晶石粉。我把工人们大略地溜了一眼，就是没有看见朱文清队长。
    “看见队长吗？”我拉住一个工人问。
    “才过去，瞧就在堆重晶石粉那里。”工人给我指着说。我随着他所指的方向走过去，这里倒是有三、四个人，但还是没有朱文清的影子，我心里可有些不耐烦了，只好又问另一个工人：“你们队长到底到那里去了？”
      “呵！是江林工程师吗？”一个弯着腰正准备背重晶石粉的小伙子，微微地抬起头来，他脸上涂满了原油，在灯光下闪闪地发亮。要不是他说话的声音，我还认不出这是朱文清。他没有等我回答，紧接着又说：“刚才又喷了一会，真厉害，一下子就冒上十几公尺高。”朱文清兴高采烈的比划着，然后用手在脸上抹了一下，放到鼻子跟前贪婪地、使劲地吸了一口气：“嘿！味道真够劲，准是头等原油。”接着朱文清扛上一袋重晶石粉，把我领到泥浆池旁边。他拿起一根棍子，在泥浆池里搅动了一下：“瞧，这浮在上面的全是原油，现在都冻得变成块块了。你知道现在的气候真够呛，一下子就降到零下三十多度。”是的，这真是原油，不仅是在泥浆池里，也溢出了外面，沿着山沟往下淌了好多，在茫茫的雪原上，只见一条小小的黑渠，一直淌到一百多公尺外的地方。
    “还不赶紧把泥浆池里的原油捞出来，别减轻了泥浆比重，一会油又得往上喷了。”我提醒着朱文清。他一听见，便连忙找来一只铁桶，弯下腰去舀浮漂在泥浆上面的原油。
    “老朱，让工人来舀吧！你是队长应该照顾全面呵！”看见朱文清那个艰难的样子，我知道他够累的了。我想起了打从这口井，发生了卡钻的事故后，朱文清便日夜守在井上，亲自动手解除事故。就这样一直到昨晚上九点多，才解除了事故。他本来打算夜里十二点钟，交通车来的时候回矿上去，谁知道没隔上二个多小时，便出乎意料之外地喷油了。如今，他整整有六天的时间，没有阁过眼。这会儿我有意让他休息一会。
    “呵！”朱文清又犹疑了一会，但当他望了望工人们，便很快地改口说：“他们还要搬重晶石，忙着哩，还是我来吧！”于是他又继续舀着原油。我也不由自主地走上去，帮他把原油桶提上来，又送到机房外面去倒。只提了几桶原油，因为泥浆池沿淋上了泥浆和原油，一下子变得非常溜滑了，一不注意朱文清便滑到泥浆池里。泥浆淹没到朱文清的腰，泥浆里还有碎冰片，冻得朱文清连着打了几个寒噤。
    “也好，这样倒也方便些，老江你来这里接吧！”朱文清定了定神，接着又不在乎地说。
    “还不赶快上来，再过一会不把你冻死才怪哩！”我几乎是带着命令的口气说。我趁着接过油桶的机会，顺便拉着他的手硬拖上来。这时又吹来一股子寒风，吹得朱文清猛地颤了一颤，于是牙齿不住地“得得”地磕打起来。
    “刚才的确不觉得冷。”朱文清说，看来小伙子还有些不服劲似的。
    不管怎么样，我还是把朱文清拉回帐篷去了，让他换上了技术员的棉裤。他披起老羊皮大衣，在炽旺的火炉边坐下来。这下，他才慢慢吞吞地给我汇报井喷的情况。没有多久，他便倚着墙根，“呼呼”地睡着了。
    我没有惊动他，只是沉默地回想起半年多来，我亲眼看见这些钻井工人们，每天要三次的从矿上来这里上班，下班后又要回到矿上去，每天总得跑个百多里路。这还不算，最怕的是汽车有时在路上抛锚了，这时朱文清便带领着大伙，唱着“我们工人有力量”的歌子，爬过陡峻的雪山坡，跑到井场上去继续工作。
    过了一会，我听见外面忽然噪噪嚷嚷的，心想大概又是喷上油来了，于是拔起腿来往外面走，准备到井场上招呼一下。不想正要出帐篷门的时候，踏动了一块铁板，把朱文清惊醒了，他蓦地坐起来：“怎么？又喷了吗？”这好像他事先就已经预料到了似的。
    “唔，大概是吧！”我说，我忽然想起他还没有休息好，于是把他按下劝着：“不要紧，你睡吧，我来招呼好了。”
    “不，不想睡了。”朱文清披起老羊皮大衣，又跳跳蹦蹦地跑出去了。我想追上去把他再拉回来，但他已经跑远了。
