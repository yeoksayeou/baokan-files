Xinhua News Agency, Yakeshi: The Xiniqi Forest Industry Bureau of the Inner Mongolia Forestry Administration Bureau, in the rectification movement, has seen production rising steadily and costs dropping significantly. In September, the bureau overfulfilled its production plan by 18.8%, and in the first ten days of October, it overfulfilled its plan by 10%; in September, timber costs were reduced by 8.99% compared to the plan.

During June and July, the bureau carried out the rectification movement. In order to quickly change the past situation of not completing the plan, in August, under the leadership of the Forestry Bureau Party Committee, several work groups were formed to go deep into the workshops to solve production problems. They solved the critical problem of the lack of coordination in the three processes of loading, unloading, and transporting wood, which often caused cars to be idle or stop working. At the same time, socialist education was conducted among the workers in each workshop. As a result, the workers' awareness was raised, and labor discipline was strengthened. The attendance rate in August increased by 5.06% compared to July, and in September it increased by 1.33% compared to August. The factory's labor productivity gradually increased as a result. August increased by 0.08% compared to July, and September increased by 0.07% compared to August.

    生产上升　成本下降
    据新华社牙克石讯　内蒙古森林工业管理局西尼气森林工业局，在整风运动中，生产量节节上升，成本显著下降。9月份这个局超额完成生产计划18.8％，10月上旬超额完成计划10％；9月份木材成本比计划降低8.99％。
    6、7月间这个局开展了整风运动。为迅速改变过去完不成计划的局面，8月份在森工局党委领导下，组成几个工作组深入各车间解决生产中的问题。他们解决了木材的装、卸、运三个工序不协调、常使汽车窝工或停工这一关键性的问题。同时，在各车间对工人进行了社会主义教育。结果，工人觉悟提高，劳动纪律加强，8月份出勤率比7月上升5.06％，9月份又比8月份上升1.33％。这个厂劳动生产率由此逐渐上升。8月比7月上升0.08％，9月又比8月上升0.07％。
