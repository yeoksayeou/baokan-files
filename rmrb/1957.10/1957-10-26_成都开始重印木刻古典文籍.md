    Chengdu Begins Reprining Woodblock Classical Texts

    In order to preserve and promote local cultural heritage, Sichuan Province has begun to systematically reprint ancient woodblock books.

    This summer, based on reader demand and under the leadership of the Sichuan Provincial cultural authorities, the Sichuan People's Publishing House has gathered 50,350 woodblocks preserved by the Sichuan Provincial Library from private collections such as the Yan family of Weinan and the Liu family of Shuangliu, as well as those transferred by Sichuan University from the Jinjiang Academy and Zunjing Academy of Chengdu in the Qing Dynasty. These were concentrated at Zhaojue Temple outside the north gate of Chengdu for sorting. After several months of preparation, the following twenty-four titles have been selected for printing on the site of Zhaojue Temple: “Du (Fu) Shi Jing Quan (annotated by Yang Xihe of Yanghu)," "Anthology of Phonology (including 'Mao Shi Gu Yin Kao,' 'Yinxue Wu Shu,' 'Qu Song Gu Yin Yi,' 'Jiang Shi Yinxue Shi Shu,' etc.)," "Chronicles of Huayang," "Dream Pool Essays (Song Dynasty, Shen Kuo)," "Shu Jian," "Xiang Army Records," "Seventeen Histories Considered," "Collected Poems of Li Yishan," "Collected Works of Dai Dongyuan," "Annotations to Selections of Six Dynasties Prose," "Annotations to Bai Xiang's Song Lyric Meter," "Wang Zhi," "The Literary Mind and the Carving of Dragons," "Zhang Binglin (Taiyan)'s Revised Three Character Classic," "Shu Xue," "Ben Jing Feng Yuan," "Simple Annotations and Prescriptions of Treatise on Febrile Diseases Caused by Cold," "Simple Annotations and Prescriptions of Synopsis of Golden Chamber," and "Systematic Differentiation of Warm Diseases."

    Currently, in addition to producing samples of the twenty-four titles to solicit reader feedback, "Dream Pool Essays," "Anthology of Phonology," and "Du Shi Jing Quan" have already been printed. These books are not only renowned for their excellent engraving and collation but are also relatively important academic works. Considerable effort has been put into the binding and printing of the reprinted ancient books. Higher-quality handmade natural-color paper from Jiajiang County and soot ink are used, creating a harmonious effect. They are both practical and aesthetically pleasing. To facilitate readers, the Sichuan People's Publishing House has prepared a mail-order service for these books, and readers can order directly from the publisher. The plan is to print twenty-four titles this year, with more to be added next year.

    The Sichuan Provincial cultural leadership also encourages qualified antiquarian booksellers to reprint better-quality editions circulating in the market. Xue Chongli of the Xinmin Bookstore on Yudaiqiao Street in Chengdu, in addition to having already printed "Zhang (Taiyan) Series Continued Compilation" and "Three Hundred Song Lyrics," has recently published "Song Lyrics by the Four Great Masters of the Qing Dynasty (Bantang Ci, Qiaofeng Yuefu, Huifeng Ci, Jiangcun Yuye)" for distribution to readers.

    成都开始重印木刻古典文籍
    为了保存与发扬地方文化遗产，四川省已经开始有计划地重印木刻古本书籍。
    今年夏天四川人民出版社根据读者需要，在四川省文化部门领导研究下，已将四川省图书馆保存的渭南严氏、双流刘氏等私家书版和四川大学移交的清代成都锦江书院、尊经书院书版计五万零三百五十块，集中成都北门外昭觉寺，进行整理。经过了几个月的准备工作，已经精选了“杜（甫）诗镜铨（阳湖杨西和编辑）”、“音韵学丛书（包括“毛诗古音考”、“音学五书”、“屈宋古音义”、“江氏音学十书”等等）”、“华阳国志”、“梦溪笔谈（宋，沈括）”、“蜀鉴”、“湘军志”、“十七史商榷”、“李义山诗集”、“戴东原集”、“六朝文絜笺注”、“白香词谱笺”、“王志”、“文心雕龙”、“章炳麟（太炎）重订三字经”、“述学”、“本经逢原”、“伤寒论浅注方论合编”、“金匮要略浅注方论合编”、和“温病条辨”等二十四种，就在昭觉寺址印制。
    现在，除印出二十四种书样征求读者外，并已印出了“梦溪笔谈”、“音韵学丛书”、“杜诗镜铨”等书。这些书不但以刻校俱佳见称，而且都是比较重要的学术著作。重印出来的古书，在装帧上、印刷上都下过较大的功夫。使用夹江县出产的较好的手工本色对方纸和桐烟墨色，很调和。既实用，又美观。为便利读者起见，四川人民出版社已经准备好了这类书籍的邮购工作，读者可以直接向该社订购。今年计划印出二十四种，明年还要继续增加。
    四川省文化领导部门也鼓励有条件的古旧书商重印坊间较好的刻本，成都市玉带桥街新民书局薛崇礼除已印出“章氏（太炎）丛书续编”、“宋词三百首”等两种外，最近又印出了“清四家词（半塘词、樵风乐府、蕙风词、疆村语业）”向读者发行。（四川省文化局）
