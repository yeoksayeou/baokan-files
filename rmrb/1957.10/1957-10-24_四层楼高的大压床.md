    Four-Story-High Giant Press
    The mechanical press manufactured by the Soviet Union for the First Automobile Factory has been installed ahead of schedule and is currently undergoing trial runs.

    This giant press, used to manufacture automobile main beams, can produce main beams for more than 60,000 automobiles annually. Once it is put into production, the automobile factory will be able to supply its own main beams for the production of various automobiles, without needing to import them from abroad.

    This giant press is four stories high and has a pressure of 3,500 tons. The Moscow Likhachev Automobile Factory specifically built a plant, manufactured a complete set of processing equipment and lifting and transportation equipment, and assigned the most experienced engineers to manufacture this press for China.

    四层楼高的大压床
    苏联为第一汽车厂制造的机械压床已经提前完成安装，目前正在试车。
    这台制造汽车主梁用的巨型压床，一年可以生产六万多辆汽车用的大梁。它投入生产后，汽车厂生产各种汽车所用的大梁，都可以自行供应。无需再从国外进货。
    这台大压床有四层楼那么高，压力有三千五百吨。莫斯科利哈乔夫汽车工厂为给中国制造这台压床，曾经专门盖了厂房，制造了成套加工设备和起重运输设备，并且配备了最有经验的工程师。　（据新华社讯）
