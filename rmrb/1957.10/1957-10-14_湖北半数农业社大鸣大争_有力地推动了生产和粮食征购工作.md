Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, October 13th: Nearly half of the agricultural cooperatives in Hubei Province, about 20,000, have launched the "Great Blooming, Great Letting Out, and Great Debate." The first batch of more than 3,500 cooperatives in Xiangyang, Jingzhou, Xiaogan and other regions have basically concluded the great debate.

Prior to this, nearly 300,000 rural cadres and party members throughout the province had participated in the three-level cadre meetings at the county level and the district and township party member training meetings, receiving profound education through the "Great Blooming, Great Letting Out, and Great Debate." Then, they went to the countryside to assist the party organizations of townships and cooperatives in carrying out a nationwide socialist great debate. In addition to holding small-scale blooming meetings and debate meetings, agricultural cooperatives and production teams in various places also adopted methods such as field and threshing ground heart-to-heart talks and in-depth family visits to mobilize the masses to speak out. When transitioning to the great debate, many townships and cooperatives also held exhibitions comparing the past and present of the entire township, the entire cooperative, and typical figures. Xiangyang Prefecture alone held more than 4,000 such exhibitions of material objects. Members of the Miaopu Agricultural Cooperative in Nanzhang County commented on the great significance of this great debate for consolidating the socialist position in the countryside, saying, "The land reform was the first liberation, the cooperativization was the second liberation, learning the General Line and implementing the unified purchase and sale is the first guarantee of liberation, and this socialist education is the second guarantee of liberation."

Currently, the rural areas of Hubei are busy with the autumn harvest and drought-resistant winter planting. Grain procurement and cooperative distribution are also underway. The socialist great debate in agricultural cooperatives in various places has powerfully promoted the development of these tasks. In some areas, due to prolonged drought and water scarcity, some people lacked confidence in drought-resistant winter planting. Agricultural cooperatives guided farmers to start with debates on drought-resistant winter planting, summarizing the achievements and experiences of drought resistance in previous years, breaking the masses' idea of "relying on the heavens for food," and starting a wave of drought-resistant winter planting. After understanding the benefits of the unified purchase and sale of grain through the great debate, farmers in various places were extremely enthusiastic about handing over public grain and selling surplus grain. Many townships and cooperatives that originally claimed it was difficult to complete the unified purchase tasks have now mostly overfulfilled their tasks. (Attached picture)

　　While carrying out the socialist great debate, members of the Qianjin Agricultural Cooperative in Fengtai County, Anhui Province, put forward many rationalization proposals for the work of the cooperative. The leaders of the cooperative also made timely improvements.

In the past, due to unreasonable manure accumulation remuneration, the enthusiasm of the members to accumulate manure was not high; now the cooperative has made reasonable adjustments to the manure accumulation remuneration, which has aroused a climax of manure accumulation.

### 湖北半数农业社大鸣大争  有力地推动了生产和粮食征购工作

　　湖北半数农业社大鸣大争
    有力地推动了生产和粮食征购工作
    新华社武汉13日电　湖北省已有半数的农业社近两万个社展开了大鸣大放大辩论，襄阳、荆州、孝感等地区第一批三千五百多个社基本上结束了大辩论。
    在这以前，全省将近有三十万名农村干部和党员，参加了各县三级干部会议和区、乡党员集训会，通过大鸣大放大辩论，首先受到了深刻的教育。然后他们去农村协助乡、社的党组织，开展了全民性的社会主义大辩论。各地农业社、生产队除了召开小型鸣放会、辩论会以外，还采取了田间、稻场谈心，深入家庭访问串连等等办法，启发群众鸣放。在转入大辩论时，许多乡、社还举办了全乡、全社以及典型人物的今昔对比展览会，仅襄阳专区就举办了四千多起实物展览会。南漳县苗圃农业社的社员们，评论这场大辩论对于巩固农村社会主义阵地的重大意义说：“土地改革是第一次翻身，合作化是第二次翻身，学习总路线和实行统购统销是第一次保翻身，这次的社会主义教育是第二次保翻身。”
    当前，湖北农村正忙于秋收和抗旱冬播，粮食征购和合作社分配工作也在紧张进行，各地农业社的社会主义大辩论有力地推动这些工作的发展。有些地区由于干旱日久，水源困难，部分群众对抗旱冬播缺乏信心，农业社就引导农民从抗旱冬播辩论起，总结了前几年抗旱的成绩和经验，打破了群众“靠天吃饭”的思想，掀起了抗旱冬播的热潮。各地农民通过大辩论认识了粮食统购统销的好处后，交公粮、卖余粮的情绪极高，很多原来叫喊难以完成统购任务的乡、社，现在大多超额完成了任务。（附图片）
    安徽省凤台县前进农业社在开展社会主义大辩论的同时，社员们对社里的工作提出了不少的合理化建议。社的领导也做到及时改进。

    左图：社员们要求社里公开从今年1月到现在的账目后，领导上接受了大家的意见，并立即邀请了县委会计辅导员杜家轩（左一）帮助社里会计进行整理账目，准备公布。
    过去，由于积肥报酬不合理，社员们积肥积极性不高；现在社里对积肥的报酬已作了合理的调整，激起了积肥高潮。这是社员们在挖沟泥。
