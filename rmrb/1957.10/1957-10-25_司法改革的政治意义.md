    The Political Significance of Judicial Reform

    Law and the judicial system always serve politics. The entire set of laws and judicial systems of old China, no matter how many seemingly universal expressions of the so-called will of the people they contained, were essentially sophisticated machines for the Kuomintang reactionary rule to exploit the broad masses of working people. Precisely because of this, at the very beginning of the people's revolutionary movement, destroying the old legal system and the old judicial system became a life-and-death struggle for the revolutionary masses to liberate themselves.

    The people's laws, decrees, and judicial system are products of the people's revolutionary movement, created in the struggle to destroy the Kuomintang reactionary rule and all its laws, decrees, and judicial systems. The judicial reform movement, which includes opposing old legal viewpoints and rectifying judicial organs at all levels, is actually a continuation of this struggle.

    The great political significance of judicial reform lies in its implementation of the Common Program and the people's revolutionary line of judicial work. It was a movement carried out in the early days of the People's Republic to thoroughly complete the democratic revolution in the judicial field. It is an indispensable mass political and ideological struggle for consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship.

### 司法改革的政治意义

专栏：报刊论文摘要

    司法改革的政治意义
    法律和司法制度总是服务于政治的。旧中国的整套法律和司法制度，不论它们里面有多少似是而非的所谓表现全民意志的东西，它本质上只能是国民党反动统治的压榨广大劳动人民的精巧的机器。正因为这样，所以在人民革命运动一开始的时候，摧毁旧法统和旧司法制度，也就成为革命群众解放自己的一个生死的斗争。
    人民的法律、法令和司法制度是人民革命运动的产物，是在摧毁国民党反动统治及其一切法律、法令和司法制度的斗争中创立起来的；而以反对旧法观点和整顿各级司法机关为内容的司法改革运动，实际上也就是这个斗争的继续。
    司法改革的巨大政治意义，就在于它是贯彻了共同纲领和人民革命历来的司法工作路线，它是建国初期为了彻底完成民主革命在司法方面进行的一个运动，它是巩固人民民主专政不可缺少的一项群众性的政治斗争和思想斗争。
