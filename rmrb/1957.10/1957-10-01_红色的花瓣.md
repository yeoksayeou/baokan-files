    Red Petals
    Han Yiping
    She returned from her night shift with a few blue stars
    Not even having had time to shake off the flowers covering her
    Took a sprig of red jujube branches from the mirror
    And poured a pocketful of pink petals into a bamboo basket
    In the past, at this moment upon arriving home,
    Perhaps she would carefully sweep away the white flowers from the edge of her skirt
    Perhaps she would be combing her braids in front of the mirror
    Perhaps she would be holding her baby
    Perhaps she would be leaning against the bed, gently reading the newspaper...
    She did none of these things
    She picked up the bunch of flowering branches and lifted her small basket
    At the window, she strung together the pink petals
    With her hands that had just twisted thousands of fine threads
    The petals were placed together one by one
    Red flowers bloomed in her hands
    These are flowers strung together with happiness
    This flower will never wither
    Just like her young, imaginative heart
    This flower is as fresh as a newly budding rose
    Because this bouquet of flowers is to be held up for Chairman Mao to see

    红色的花瓣
    韩忆萍
    她带着数点蓝星从夜班回来了
    满身的飞花都没来得及抖去
    从镜上取下一杈红色的枣枝
    又把满兜粉色的花瓣倒进竹篮
    往日在这个刚进家的时刻
    也许正仔细扫净裙边的白花
    也许正对着镜子梳着发辫
    也许正把娃娃抱起
    也许正倚着床把报纸轻轻的念……
    这些事她一件也没有做
    她取下那束花枝提起她的小篮
    在窗前她串着粉红的花瓣
    用她那刚刚捻接过千百根细纱的手
    花瓣一片一片地挨在一起了
    红花开放在她的手上
    这是用幸福串连起来的花呵
    这枝花永远都不会雕谢
    就像她那颗年轻充满幻想的心
    这枝花像刚放蕾的玫瑰一样新鲜
    因为这束花要举给毛主席看
