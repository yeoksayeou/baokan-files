In the rural areas of Anhui Province, through the socialist great debate, the socialist ideological awareness of the peasants has been raised, and they are very enthusiastic about fighting drought and planting wheat.

According to a survey of adults in poor and lower-middle peasant households in two agricultural cooperatives, Dongqing and others in Fuyang County, after this great debate, more than 80% firmly support the socialist system; although the rest are not firm enough, they also expressed their willingness to take the socialist road. Before the great debate, some well-to-do middle peasants had more serious capitalist thoughts. After debate and criticism, most people's ideological awareness has also been raised. The unity between middle and poor peasants is closer than in the past. In the Langya Agricultural Cooperative of Chu County, twenty-four well-to-do middle peasants made erroneous remarks in the "blooming and contending," and individual ones even made reactionary remarks. After the great debate, twenty-one of them have turned back to the socialist position, expressing their determination to correct their mistakes and take the socialist road. Before the debate, some members requested to withdraw from the cooperative. After the debate, those who wanted to withdraw did not, and those who had withdrawn returned. Some individual households also requested to join the cooperative.

After the great debate, a new upsurge in production has emerged in the countryside. Recently, agricultural cooperatives in various places are making every effort to fight the drought. The number of peasants involved in the drought resistance throughout the province has reached 9 million. Such a large-scale drought resistance movement has never happened in history. In the Jingxi Cooperative of Wuhu County, the labor attendance rate has increased from 65% in the past to 95%. In the Machang Township of Chu County, 100% of the labor force of each agricultural cooperative participated in the drought resistance, and it took only five days to plant 3,600 mu of wheat. After the great debate, township and cooperative cadres also actively participated in production. (Xinhua News Agency)

    安徽省广大农村出现规模空前的抗旱高潮
    安徽省农村中通过社会主义大辩论，农民的社会主义思想觉悟提高，抗旱种麦的劲头很大。
    据阜阳县东清等两个农业社在贫农和下中农的成年人中调查，经过这场大辩论以后，坚决拥护社会主义制度的已达80％以上；其余的人虽然表现不够坚决，但也表示愿意走社会主义的道路。大辩论之前，有些富裕中农存在比较严重的资本主义思想，经过辩论和批判，大部分人的思想觉悟也有了提高。中、贫农之间的团结比过去更加紧密。滁县琅琊农业社在鸣放中有二十四个富裕中农有错误言论，个别的还有反动言论，经过大辩论之后，有二十一个已经回头站到社会主义立场上来，表示坚决改正错误，走社会主义道路。在辩论之前，有些社员要求退社。辩论之后，要求退社的不退了，已退的回社了，一些单干户也要求入社。
    经过大辩论，农村中已经出现了新的生产高潮。最近各地农业社正在全力抗旱，全省投入抗旱的农民已达九百万人，这样大规模的抗旱运动，在历史上是从来没有过的。芜湖县荆西社劳动出勤率由过去的65％提高到95％。滁县马厂乡各农业社百分之百的劳动力都参加了抗旱，只用五天的时间就种麦三千六百亩。乡、社干部在大辩论后也更加积极地参加了生产。（新华社）
