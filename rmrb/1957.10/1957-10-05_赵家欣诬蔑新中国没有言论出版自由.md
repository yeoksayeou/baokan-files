Zhao Jiaxin Slanders New China for Lacking Freedom of Speech and Publication

    Zhao Jiaxin, a member of the Fujian Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League and its propaganda minister, and a rightist, recently attended the People's Congress of Fuzhou City. He was refuted by numerous people's representatives from Fuzhou City using a large amount of specific facts for his slanderous claim that "New China lacks freedom of speech and publication."

    Zhao Jiaxin once wrote an article entitled "Whispers and Scattered Rain," viciously slandering that New China has no freedom of speech and publication. He advocated establishing a "garden" for debate to publish his so-called "sharply critical" manuscripts. Many representatives powerfully refuted Zhao Jiaxin's arguments at the meeting. Zhang Zhuangfei, an observer representative and deputy director of the Fujian branch of China News Agency, said that Chiang Kai-shek's crimes of devastating the people's freedom of speech and publication during his twenty years of rule in China are "too numerous to record." He promulgated many regulations and measures to stifle the people's freedom of speech and publication. With just the "Publication Law" and "Book and Magazine Review Measures" alone, more than a thousand kinds of books and periodicals were seized and destroyed in Beijing. Only after the founding of New China did we have true freedom of speech and publication, which is also clearly stipulated in the Constitution. In 1956 alone, the national publishing industry increased threefold in newspaper circulation and more than tenfold in book and magazine circulation compared with 1936, the highest level of cultural development during the Kuomintang rule. Can it be said that New China does not have freedom of speech and publication?

    It was revealed that Zhao Jiaxin is a pawn of Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji, accepting the entire reactionary political program of the Zhang-Luo alliance and the instructions of its core member, Shen Zhiyuan. Starting from attacking the people's publishing industry, he attempted to use newspapers to stir up trouble and undermine the socialist cause.

    赵家欣诬蔑新中国没有言论出版自由
    最近出席福州市人代大会的福州市人民代表，用大量具体的事实驳斥了民盟福建省常委兼宣传部长、右派分子赵家欣的“新中国没有言论出版自由”的谰言。
    赵家欣曾经写过一篇题为“风丝雨片”的文章，恶毒地诬蔑新中国没有言论出版自由。他主张要办一个争鸣的“园地”，来刊登他所谓“批评尖锐”的稿件。许多代表对赵家欣的论点在会上予以有力地驳斥。列席代表、中国新闻社福建分社副社长张壮飞说，蒋介石统治中国二十年，摧残人民言论出版自由的罪恶是“罄竹难书”的。他颁布过许多扼杀人民的言论出版自由的条例和办法。只颁布“出版法”和“图书杂志审查办法”二项法令，仅北京一地就有一千种以上的书刊被扣烧毁。新中国成立后，才有了真正的言论出版自由，宪法上还作了明文规定。仅1956年全国的出版事业同国民党统治时期文化事业发展水平最高的1936年来比较，报纸发行增加了三倍，书籍杂志发行额超过了十倍多，这难道说新中国言论出版不自由吗？
    据揭露，赵家欣是章罗的走卒，接受章罗联盟的全部反动政治纲领，及其骨干分子沈志远的指示，从攻击人民出版事业着手，企图利用报纸来呼风唤雨，兴波作浪，破坏社会主义事业。
