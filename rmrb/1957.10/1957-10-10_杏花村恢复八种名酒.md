    Xinghua Village Restores Eight Famous Liquors

    The Xinghua Village Distillery in Shanxi Province recently restored the production of eight kinds of Fenjiu liquor. These liquors are White Jade, Rose, Papaya, Osmanthus, Buddha's Hand, Yinzhen, Zhuangyuan Hong (Top Graduate Red), and Wu Jiapi.

    In the past, these liquors, like the currently popular Bamboo Leaf Green Fenjiu, enjoyed a great reputation among consumers. Production was gradually halted after 1937 due to the impact of the war.

    These eight kinds of Fenjiu each have their own unique characteristics. At the same time, they all retain the fragrant and delicious characteristics inherent in Fenjiu. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    杏花村恢复八种名酒
    山西省杏花村酒厂最近将恢复八种汾酒的生产。这些酒是白玉、玫瑰、木瓜、桂花、佛手、茵阵、状元红和五加皮。
    过去，这些酒同现在畅销的竹叶青汾酒一样，在广大消费者中享有盛名。直到1937年以后，才由于战争影响先后停止了生产。
    这八种汾酒都各具特色。同时又都保持着汾酒所固有的芬芳可口的特点。　（据新华社讯）
