Xinhua News Agency, October 24th. Kim Il-sung, Premier of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, sent a telegram to Chairman Mao Zedong on October 23rd, expressing gratitude on the seventh anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteers' participation in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea. The telegram is as follows:

To Comrade Mao Zedong, Chairman of the People's Republic of China:

On the occasion of the seventh anniversary of the heroic Chinese People's Volunteers' participation in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, I, on behalf of the entire Korean people and the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, extend my heartfelt gratitude to you, and through you, to the entire fraternal Chinese people.

During the Korean people's just Fatherland Liberation War against the U.S. imperialist aggressors, the officers and soldiers of the fraternal Chinese People's Volunteers, who aided the Korean people with their blood, continue to defend the line of peace like an impregnable wall in the post-war period, just as they did during the war, standing shoulder to shoulder with the Korean People's Army, and actively helping the Korean people to restore and build the post-war people's economy.

The glorious and great achievements established by the true internationalist fighters—the fraternal Chinese People's Volunteers—will be passed down for generations among our people.

I firmly believe that the unbreakable friendly relations consolidated and developed between our two peoples in the common struggle against foreign aggressors will make a great contribution to the prosperity and development of our two countries and to the cause of safeguarding peace in Asia and the world.

I sincerely wish the Chinese people even more brilliant victories in socialist construction, safeguarding peace in Asia and the world, and in the struggle to further strengthen the unity between the people of the socialist camp headed by the great Soviet Union.

Kim Il-sung
Premier of the Cabinet of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea
October 23, 1957, in Pyongyang
