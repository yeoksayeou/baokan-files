Shanghai's literary and artistic magazines are preparing to greet the 40th anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution with rich and varied content.

The large-scale magazine "Wenyi Yuebao" (Literary Monthly) is organizing well-known writers who have visited the Soviet Union and experts in Soviet literature to write articles and essays introducing the latest developments in Soviet literature and its influence on Chinese literature. This nearly 100,000-character special issue will appear in the November issue.

The youth literary magazine "Mengya" (Sprouts) will publish a special issue on November 1st. It will include a specially translated work by Soviet writer Mikhail Sholokhov describing the fighting life of the Red Army in the Don region and Bedny's famous poem "On the Street"; an article by Yi Qun written for young readers titled "Soviet Literature Gives Chinese Youth Great Strength"; essays, features, and novels written by Jin Yi and others; in addition to a special poetry collection "The Road to Defending the October Revolution" and a complete set of comics with poems on the theme of praising the Soviet Sixth Five-Year Plan.

"Zhen贵的友谊" (Precious Friendship), which won a gold medal at the 6th World Youth Festival, and other translated Soviet songs such as "Qin Ru Xiongdi" (Close as Brothers) (Friendship Song of the Chinese and Soviet Armed Forces) and "Forty Springs," will be published in this month's "Guangbo Gexuan" (Broadcast Song Selections).

The October issue of the bi-monthly "Ban Hua" (Prints) contains a letter from Soviet printmakers to Chinese printmakers filled with fighting enthusiasm and artistic support. There are also more than ten extremely valuable Soviet prints, which have never been published in China before.

The November issue of "Dianying Gushi" (Film Stories) is also a "special issue." It uses the cover, back cover, and all the colored illustrations to introduce the new films for the grand Soviet Film Week that will be held soon.
