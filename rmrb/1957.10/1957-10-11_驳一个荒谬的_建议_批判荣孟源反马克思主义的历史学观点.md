　　Refuting an Absurd "Suggestion"
　　——Criticizing Rong Mengyuan's Anti-Marxist Historical Views
　　Liu Danian

    Rong Mengyuan's article "Suggestions for Compiling Historical Materials Since the 1911 Revolution," published in the July issue of "New Construction" this year, ostensibly raises issues of emphasizing materials, inheriting tradition, and the coexistence of various styles. In reality, it raises the question of what position Marxism occupies and what role it plays in historical research. On this latter question, his answer is negative. This deserves the attention of the historical community and needs to be refuted!
    Our historical science has a long history. Many outstanding historians in the past have provided abundant and scientific results, which have played an important role in the development of this discipline. However, they ultimately failed to establish a complete historical science. Only in the last thirty or forty years, after Marxism was introduced into China, did the study of Chinese social history begin to be truly based on science. Marxism is the doctrine of the proletarian revolution. The proletariat demands the abolition of all systems of exploitation and oppression. Standing on this position, history can be critically treated according to the principles of historical materialism, the objective laws of historical development can be understood, and efforts can be made to correctly guide revolutionary practice according to the objective laws of history. The higher the degree of scientificity achieved by using Marxism to study history, the stronger its revolutionary nature. Since Marxism was introduced into China, the face of our historical science has been completely renewed, which is obvious to all. Although we must point out: first, using Marxism to solve problems in Chinese history is an arduous process, and we are only beginning to move forward on the correct path; second, it is not required that everyone studying history today immediately become a true Marxist, and the situation where Marxists are in the minority will not change in a short period of time; third, research that is not conducted using Marxism, as long as it has merits, must also be given due importance. But what is even more important is that we must recognize the leading position of Marxism in historical science; more people must learn to use Marxist viewpoints and methods to study Chinese history; and we must constantly strive to overcome the anti-scientific nature of feudal and bourgeois idealistic historical science and get rid of its influence. Because facts have proven that this is the only correct path to develop our historical science. Anyone with a scientific attitude must insist on taking this path.
    Rong Mengyuan's "suggestion" is exactly the opposite of ours. He wrote in his article: "Currently, historical works since the 1911 Revolution, apart from original materials, are mostly essays combining narration and commentary. While essays are necessary, replacing everything with essays hinders the research of historical science." He also said: "If historical research is limited to writing essays, many people will inevitably put down their pens; if writing historical books of various styles, compiling various materials, and sorting out various specific issues, then many people can exert their strength." Here, it is clearly stated that the "essays" Rong Mengyuan refers to are the writings guided by Marxism, while the "historical books of various styles" refer to historical works that do not use Marxism or are anti-Marxist. One proof is that he opposes the current practice of some essays "combining narration and commentary." In fact, old Chinese historical books, apart from original materials, have always combined narration and commentary, and this is not something that only exists today. For example, "the gentleman says" in *Zuo Zhuan*, "the Grand Historian says" in *Records of the Grand Historian*, "praises" in *Book of Han*, and "臣光 says" in *Zizhi Tongjian* are one form; the many events narrated by Sima Qian, Sima Guang, and others, using narration and commentary to express the author's rights and wrongs, praise and criticism, and affections, which are fascinating, are another form. The various styles pointed out by predecessors, such as the six schools of *Shangshu* and *Chunqiu*, and the various bodies of chronicle and biography, although different in form, the combination of narration and commentary is a common practice. Rong Mengyuan has no objection to these, but is only dissatisfied with "historical works since the 1911 Revolution," which shows that the "essays combining narration and commentary" he opposes are none other than essays that use Marxist viewpoints to explain history. The second proof is that he asserts that writing "essays" is very difficult, while writing "historical books" of other styles is very easy. Everyone knows that an essay is just one of the various writing styles and has never been regarded as particularly profound. On the contrary, it is a commonly used style in ancient and modern times, and there is no reason to oppose it to other styles. Only works guided by Marxism and works that do not use Marxism or are anti-Marxist have fundamental differences, and also differences in difficulty. Therefore, the essays that Rong Mengyuan claims "many people will inevitably put down their pens" refers to nothing else but Marxist historical works. The meaning of these two points is very clear.
    After revealing the essence of Rong Mengyuan's rejection of so-called "essays," his true face of excluding and canceling Marxism and attacking Marxism's leading position in historical science is nakedly exposed. We say that Chinese historical science can only develop if we insist on the guidance of Marxism, but Rong Mengyuan asserts that this will hinder the research of historical science and prevent many people from exerting their strength. Two thoughts, two propositions, are in such sharp opposition! The bourgeoisie and all idealists have long attacked Marxism as dogma, as something rigid and outdated. They curse Marxism for hindering scientific development, shackling freedom of thought, etc., believing that without destroying the prestige of Marxist theory, there is no hope of expanding the bourgeois ideological position. Rong Mengyuan's attack is exactly something of this nature. The difference is that he proposes it in a concealed way, which is easy to be ignored, and thus makes his destructive role easier to spread.
    Speaking of emphasizing materials, accepting heritage, and the simultaneous existence of various styles, no one with a Marxist viewpoint has ever disagreed. Researching history requires fully collecting materials, cherishing the heritage left by predecessors, including various styles created by past people and suitable for current practice. Marx pointed out: "Research must collect rich materials, analyze its different forms of development, and explore the internal connections of these various forms" (*Capital*, Volume 1, Second Edition Postscript). Some of Marx's own historical works, such as *The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte*, *Chronological Abstracts of Indian History*, and *The Class Struggles in France*, have various styles. No one can point out which of them are Marxist and which are non-Marxist. In fact, we also attach great importance to the work of collecting and sorting out materials. In recent years, the academic community has collected, sorted out, and published various historical documents and research materials, both in terms of scale and quantity, which were unimaginable before liberation. Currently, historical books and periodicals that are published are blooming in terms of style, with all kinds of "essays," writings by Mr. Chen Yinke and Mr. Chen Yuan in their respective styles, and Mr. Luo Ergang's history of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom written in the style of "official history," etc., and no style is excluded.
    Rong Mengyuan is well aware of these facts. But he still claims that the problems of materials, styles, and tradition have not been solved, because his so-called materials and styles, as pointed out earlier, are the various historical books that do not use Marxism. Rong Mengyuan said this: "In order to seriously and earnestly study the history since the 1911 Revolution, we should first inherit the excellent historical tradition of our country and write materials of various styles (elsewhere written as 'write historical books of various styles')." He also said: "The various styles of traditional Chinese historical science are all flowers, and they should bloom together with the flowers of essay style." Rong Mengyuan is once again asserting that Marxism is just one of the flowers blooming together, without a guiding role; studying history is not about first accepting the guidance of Marxism, but about first inheriting tradition, which, according to his understanding, is to restore all the old things. Starting from this, he pieced together several articles discussing "the style of national history" from the inaugural issue of the "National History Museum Journal" of the Kuomintang, changed some tone, and supplemented some examples, and put forward a suggestion including eight items of "compilation content" including records, treatises, tables, biographies, and atlases. At a glance, this is not about collecting and sorting out materials at all, but about advocating "writing" old-style historical books. As a historical record, the "official history" composed of contents such as books, biographies, tables, and treatises has its value for circulation, but neither its form nor its content can adapt to the requirements of comprehensive and relatively scientific narration of history. Even from a bourgeois point of view, it is backward. Liang Qichao said: "From Sima Qian and Ban Gu to Bi Yuan and Zhao Yi, there are no less than hundreds of historians. This learning has developed for two thousand years. However, they are all repeating the same old things, and there is no one who can open up a new world for the historical field and make the merits of this learning popular among the people..." (*Yinbingshi Heji Wenji*, Volume 4, Page 2). Chinese bourgeois historical science has indeed made progress compared to feudal historical science. Some propositions in the "National History Museum Journal" of the Kuomintang were just a manifestation of the bourgeois cultural restoration tendency under the dark rule of the Kuomintang, and did not reflect the progressive tendency of bourgeois historical science at all. Rong Mengyuan does not hesitate to inherit these as "excellent traditions" and believes that "of course, this cannot be limited to modern Chinese history, let alone the forty years of history since the 1911 Revolution," which means that it should be applied to the entire field of historical science. Obviously, if we act according to this proposition, we will not only pull Chinese historical science back to the old road of the bourgeoisie, but also pull it back to the old road of feudalism. This is the reason why Rong Mengyuan believes that Marxism hinders historical research and demands the cancellation of Marxism's leading position in historical research, and it is also its inevitable result.
    Various erroneous views are circulating on issues such as historical materials and traditions. Rong Mengyuan's thought is one of the more concentrated and representative thoughts among them. In the view of Rong Mengyuan and others, the reason why historical science becomes science lies only in collecting and collating historical materials and distinguishing between truth and falsehood. To promote China's historical research, the main guideline is to collect, sort out, and verify. This is because they stand on the bourgeois position, are disgusted by mentioning class struggle, want to use historical materialism to replace the study of historical laws, and lead people into a dead end. Rong Mengyuan and others' view of heritage is blindly praising the past, regarding heritage as something without class attributes, and generally demanding to accept tradition and refusing to "give a critical summary with Marxist methods." The slogan of inheriting heritage, in their hands, is a tool to oppose Marxism and promote feudalism and bourgeois thought.
    According to the above, we can clearly see that Rong Mengyuan's "suggestion" is to cancel the guiding position of Marxism, to replace Marxist historical science with the old feudal and bourgeois historical science, or at least to compete with Marxism with feudal and bourgeois thought; or it is a passive resistance to Marxism and an active advocacy of feudal and bourgeois historical viewpoints. We support the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend, approve of using various styles to discuss history and sort out historical materials, and do not require all authors to have Marxist viewpoints; but this and canceling the guidance of Marxism and replacing Marxist historical science with the old feudal and bourgeois historical science are completely different things. The so-called saying that only Marxism will hinder the research of historical science and the attempt to replace Marxist historical science with feudal and bourgeois historical science are fundamentally anti-scientific and reactionary. It is not difficult to understand that in today's social science research in our country, if the leadership of Marxism is cancelled and the bourgeois and even feudalist ideologies and doctrines gain a dominant position, its role must be to create a flood of bourgeois thought, and ultimately to open the way for the restoration of capitalism, let alone the social science research itself will encounter misfortune and regress.
    Rong Mengyuan's "suggestion" uses many words and phrases such as "Marxist scientific methods" and "class viewpoints," as if he supports Marxism, but it is just for show. Using "calligraphy" to replace Marxism is a prominent example. Rong Mengyuan explained "calligraphy" by saying: "Only chronicles inherit the tradition of our country, which must be straightforward and without concealment, and should also pay attention to calligraphy, that is, pay attention to position, viewpoint, and method." According to this, first, being straightforward and without concealment and position and viewpoint are incompatible, or at least contradictory; second, the so-called "calligraphy" is also the Marxist position, viewpoint, and method. As mentioned earlier, applying the Marxist position, viewpoint, and method to study history, the first thing is to stand on the position of the proletariat to critically treat all historical events, eliminate all subjective and one-sided understandings, restore the original appearance of history, and its scientificity and revolutionary nature are consistent, that is, being straightforward and without concealment and position and viewpoint are consistent. Otherwise, it will not be possible to truly clarify the objective laws of class struggle and social historical development, and it will not be conducive to revolutionary practice. According to the viewpoint of historical materialism, the working people, as the producers of material materials, are the masters of history. The evaluation of all historical figures and events is not based on the interests of a certain ruling class or feudal dynasty, but on the fundamental interests of the working people. These are all well known. Only the modern bourgeoisie, due to the loss of confidence in the future of capitalism, cannot objectively treat history and reality. Therefore, bourgeois historical science is unable to solve the problem of the connection between the subjective and the objective, and cannot but have contradictions between facts and positions. As for the so-called "calligraphy," it is even more feudalistic. "Calligraphy" originated from the "Spring and Autumn Annals" and is a means for people who held pens and expressed opinions in the feudal era to praise good and criticize evil, and distinguish between right and wrong, based on the interests of the ruling class of the dynasty. It was revered as "a word of praise, as glorious as a robe; a word of criticism, as severe as an axe." In fact, they each have their masters and slaves, and there is no right or wrong. As early as the Tang Dynasty, Liu Zhiji pointed out the flaws in the "Spring and Autumn Annals" calligraphy and that it was not credible. However, the historians of the feudal era mostly imitated it and regarded calligraphy as their duty. Zhu Xi's *Outline and Details of the Comprehensive Mirror* is the culmination of this. Its contents all express the position, viewpoint, and requirements of the feudal ruling class and reflect their interests. According to Rong Mengyuan's view of being straightforward and without concealment, calligraphy, and position and viewpoint, in fact, he equates the modern bourgeois view of history with the proletarian position and viewpoint. I ask, where is there even a trace of Marxism in this!
    Rong Mengyuan's "suggestion" appearing at this time is by no means accidental. It is part of the bourgeois rightists' anti-Party and anti-socialist activities in the academic field. Historical researchers with Marxist viewpoints are not afraid of any challenges from bourgeois thought. Since the bourgeois rightists have launched an attack, they must be given a forceful counterattack.

　　驳一个荒谬的“建议”
　　——批判荣孟源反马克思主义的历史学观点
　　刘大年
    今年七月号的“新建设”上载有荣孟源写的“建议编撰辛亥革命以来的历史资料”一文。表面上看来，“建议”中是提出的重视资料，继承传统以及各种体裁并存的问题，实际上提出的是马克思主义在历史研究中处于何种地位和起什么作用的问题。在后面这个问题上，他的答案是否定的。这值得引起史学界的注意，并有必要加以驳斥！
    我国历史学有悠久的历史。已往有许多杰出的历史学家提供了材料丰富的具有科学性的成果，在这门学问的发展中起过重要的作用。但是他们毕竟没有建立起完整的历史科学。只有在近三、四十年中马克思主义传入中国以后，才使中国社会历史的研究开始真正建立在科学的基础上。马克思主义是无产阶级革命的学说，无产阶级要求废除一切剥削和压迫制度，站在这个立场上就可以按照历史唯物主义的原则来批判地对待历史，认识历史发展的客观规律性，并力求按照历史的客观规律来正确地指导革命的实践。用马克思主义来研究历史，所达到的科学性愈高，其革命性就愈强。自马克思主义传入中国后，我国历史学的面貌已为之焕然一新，这是有目共睹的。虽然我们要指出：第一，运用马克思主义来解决中国历史上的问题，是一种艰苦的工作过程，现在还只是开始在正确的道路上前进；第二，并不是要求今天所有研究历史的人都要立刻成为真正的马克思主义者，马克思主义者只占少数的情况是不会在短时间内改变的；第三，不是用马克思主义进行的研究，只要其中有可取之处，也必须予以应有的重视。但是更加重要的是：我们必须承认马克思主义在历史科学中的领导地位；必须有更多的人学习运用马克思主义的观点和方法来研究中国历史；必须不断努力去克服封建主义和资产阶级唯心主义历史学中的反科学性质，摆脱其影响。因为事实证明，要发展我国的历史科学，这是唯一正确的道路。抱有科学态度的人，是必须坚持走这条道路的。
    荣孟源的“建议”和我们恰恰相反。他在文章中写道：“目前辛亥革命以来的历史，除去原始资料之外，多是夹叙夹议的论文。论文固然是必要的，但以论文来代替一切，那就妨害了历史科学的研究”。又说：“研究历史如果只限于写论文，许多人势必搁笔；如果撰述各种体裁的史书，编辑各种资料，整理各个具体问题，那就有许多人可以发挥力量”。在这里，清楚的表明荣孟源所说的“论文”，是指的以马克思主义为指导思想写出的论著，而“各种体裁的史书”则是指的不要马克思主义或反马克思主义的历史述作。证明之一，是他反对目前一些论文“夹叙夹议”的作法。其实旧的中国史书，除了原始资料以外，向来都是夹叙夹议，这并不是今天才有的。例如左传的“君子曰”、史记的“太史公曰”、汉书“赞曰”、资治通鉴“臣光曰”等是一种形式；司马迁、司马光等所叙述的许多事件，用夹叙夹议而表现出作者的是非褒贬和爱憎情感，引人入胜，是另一种形式。前人所指的尚书春秋等六家，编年纪传等各体，形式尽管不同，夹叙夹议却是通例。荣孟源对这些并无异议，只是不满意“目前辛亥革命以来的历史”，足见他所反对的“夹叙夹议的论文”不是别的，正是用马克思主义观点来说明历史的论文。证明之二，是他断定写“论文”困难很大，写其他体裁的“史书”则很容易。谁都知道，论文不过是各种著述体裁中的一种，从未被人看作别有高深，相反的倒是一种古今常用的体裁，完全没有理由可以把它同其他体裁对立起来。只有用马克思主义为指导的和不要马克思主义或反马克思主义的作品，两者才有原则的区别，也有难易的区别。因之荣孟源所称“许多人势必搁笔”的论文，别无所指，只能是指马克思主义的历史论著。这两点的意思都是非常明白的。
    揭穿了荣孟源排斥所谓“论文”的实质以后，他的排斥、取消马克思主义，攻击马克思主义在历史科学中的领导地位的真面目，便赤裸裸地暴露出来了。我们说必须坚持马克思主义的指导，中国历史科学才能发展，荣孟源却断定：这样就要妨害历史科学的研究，就有许多人不能发挥力量。两种思想，两个主张，是多么尖锐的对立！资产阶级和一切唯心主义者，很早以来一直攻击马克思主义为教条，为僵化了、过了时的东西，他们咒骂马克思主义妨害科学发展、束缚思想自由等等，认为不破坏马克思主义理论的威信，要扩张资产阶级思想的阵地是没有希望的。荣孟源的攻击，正是这样一种性质的东西。所不同者，他是采取隐蔽的方式提出来的，容易为人忽视，因而使他的破坏作用也更易于得到传播。
    讲到重视资料、接受遗产和各种体裁同时并存，从来没有一个具有马克思主义观点的人是不赞成的。研究历史必须充分搜集资料，珍视前人留下的遗产，包括昔人创之有故，于今行之合宜的各种体裁在内。马克思指出：“研究必须搜集丰富的材料，分析它的不同的发展形态，并探寻出这各种形态的内部联系”（资本论第一卷第二版跋）。马克思本人写的一些历史著作如“拿破仑第三政变记”、“印度史编年稿”、“法兰西阶级斗争”等就有各种不同的体裁。没有人能够指出其中哪种是马克思主义的，哪种是非马克思主义的。事实上我们也正是很重视搜集、整理资料的工作，几年来学术界收集整理出版了各种历史文献和研究资料，不论它的规模和数量，都是解放以前不能设想的。目前出版的历史书刊，就体裁说正是百花齐放，有各式各样的“论文”，有陈寅恪、陈垣先生照他们各自的风格写的论著，有罗尔纲先生照“正史”写的太平天国历史等等，并没有哪种体裁是在排除之列。
    荣孟源是熟知这些事实的。但是他仍然提出资料体裁传统问题没有得到解决，这是因为他的所谓资料和体裁，如前面指明过的是说的不要马克思主义的各种史书。荣孟源这样说：“为了严肃认真的研究辛亥革命以来的历史，首先应该继承我国优良的史学传统，撰述各种体裁的资料（另一处写为“撰述各种体裁的史书”）”。又说：“我国传统历史学的各种体裁都是一种花，都要和论文体裁的花一起开放”。荣孟源是再一次认定马克思主义只是百花齐放中的一朵花，并没有指导的作用；研究历史不是要首先接受马克思主义的指导，而是首先继承传统，照他的理解，也就是恢复一切旧的东西。由此出发，他把国民党“国史馆馆刊”创刊号上讨论“国史体例”的几篇文章拼凑在一起，改变一些口气，补充若干事例，提出了包括录、志、表、传、图谱等八项“编撰内容”的建议。一望而知，这根本不是什么搜集整理资料，而是主张“撰述”旧式的史书。作为历史的记录，汇合书、传、表、志等内容而成的“正史”有其流传的价值，但是不论它的形式和内容都远远地不能适应全面的、比较科学的叙述历史的要求。即使从资产阶级观点来看，它也是落后的。梁启超就说过：“上自太史公班孟坚，下至毕秋帆赵瓯北，以史家名者不下数百。兹学之发达，二千年于兹矣。然而陈陈相因，一丘之貉。未闻有能为史界辟一新天地，而令兹学之功德普及于国民者……”（饮冰室合集文集第四册，二页）。中国资产阶级历史学比起封建时代的历史学来确是有了进步。国民党“国史馆馆刊”上的某些主张只是国民党黑暗统治下的资产阶级文化复古主义倾向的一种表现，连资产阶级历史学的进步倾向也一点没有反映出来。荣孟源毫不踌躇，把这些都作为“优良传统”继承下来，并且认为“当然这不能限于中国近代史，更不能限于辛亥革命以来四十年的历史”，也就是说要适用于整个历史学领域。很明显的，如果按照这个主张去行事，就不仅要把中国的历史学拉回到资产阶级的老路上去，而且要拉回到封建主义的老路上去。这就是荣孟源认为马克思主义妨害历史研究、要求取消马克思主义在历史研究中的领导地位的原因，也是它的必然结局。
    在史料、传统等问题上流行着各种错误的观点。荣孟源的思想是其中比较集中的有代表性的思想。在荣孟源等人看来，历史学之所以成为科学，只在于收集考订史料，辨别真伪。要推进我国的历史研究，主要的方针就是搜集整理和考证。这是因为他们站在资产阶级立场上厌恶提到阶级斗争，要用史料学来代替历史规律的研究，把人们引到牛角尖里去。荣孟源这些人对遗产的观点，是盲目颂古，把遗产看做一种没有阶级属性的东西，笼统地要求接受传统，拒绝“用马克思主义的方法给以批判的总结”。继承遗产这个口号，在他们手里是一个反对马克思主义、宣扬封建主义和资产阶级思想的工具。
    据以上所述，我们可以很清楚地看出：荣孟源的“建议”是要取消马克思主义的指导地位，用封建的、资产阶级的旧史学来代替马克思主义的历史学，至少用封建的、资产阶级的思想与马克思主义分庭抗礼；或者说它是消极抵抗马克思主义，积极提倡封建主义和资产阶级的历史学观点。我们拥护百花齐放、百家争鸣的方针，赞成采用各种不同的体裁来论述历史、整理史料，并且不要求所有的作者都必须具有马克思主义观点；但是这和取消马克思主义的指导，用封建的和资产阶级的旧史学来代替马克思主义的历史学却完全是两回事。所谓只有马克思主义就会妨害历史科学研究的说法和企图用封建的、资产阶级的历史学来代替马克思主义历史学的作法根本是反科学的，是反动的。不难理解，在今天我国的社会科学研究中，要是取消马克思主义的领导，使资产阶级的以至封建主义的思想学说取得统治的地位，其作用一定是造成资产阶级思想的泛滥，最后是为资本主义的复辟打开道路，更不必说社会科学研究的本身因此要遭逢孽运，向后倒退了。
    荣孟源的“建议”用了不少“马克思主义的科学方法”、“阶级观点”之类的词句，好像他是拥护马克思主义的，其实不过是为了装点门面而已。用“书法”代替马克思主义便是一个显著的例子。荣孟源解释“书法”说：“惟编年史继承我国传统，既要直言无隐，又应注意书法，即注意立场、观点和方法”。照这么说来，第一，直言无隐和立场观点二者是互不相容的，至少彼此矛盾；第二，所谓“书法”也就是马克思主义的立场、观点和方法。如前面说过的，应用马克思主义的立场、观点和方法研究历史，首先是要站在无产阶级的立场上批判地对待所有历史事件，消除一切主观、片面的认识，还历史以本来面目，其科学性和革命性是一致的，也就是直言无隐和立场观点是一致的。不如此就不能够真正阐明阶级斗争、社会历史发展的客观规律，并有利于革命的实践。按照历史唯物主义的观点，作为物质资料生产者的劳动人民是历史的主人，评价一切历史人物和事件，不是从某个统治阶级或封建王朝的利害出发，而是从劳动人民的根本利益出发。这些都是人所熟知的。只有现代资产阶级由于对资本主义的前途丧失了信心，不能客观地对待历史和现实，因此资产阶级的历史学就无力解决主观和客观联系的问题，不能不存在着事实和立场之间的矛盾。至于所谓“书法”，更是封建主义的东西。“书法”源出于“春秋”，是封建时代秉笔立言的人以统治本朝阶级的利益为标准，来褒贬善恶，区别邪正的一种手段。被尊崇为“一字之褒，荣如华衮；一字之贬，严如斧钺”。其实是各有主奴，漫无是非。早在唐代，刘知几就指出过“春秋”书法的破绽百出，不足取信。但封建时代的修史者多极意摹仿，以书法为职志。朱熹的通鉴纲目更集其大成。其内容都是表示封建统治阶级的立场观点和要求，反映他们的利益的。照荣孟源对直言无隐、书法和立场观点的看法，事实上既是把现代资产阶级的历史观和无产阶级的立场观点等同起来了。试问这哪里有一点点马克思主义的气息！
    荣孟源的“建议”在这个时候出现，绝不是偶然的。它是资产阶级右派在学术领域内反党反社会主义活动的一部分。具有马克思主义观点的历史研究者是不惧怕任何资产阶级思想挑战的。资产阶级右派既然发动了进攻，就必须给予有力的还击。
