Xinhua News Agency, Rome, October 1st: According to TASS, the Central Committee of the Italian Communist Party held a plenary meeting from September 25th to 28th. Luigi Longo, Deputy General Secretary of the Italian Communist Party, made a report on the first item on the agenda: "The Central Committee Delegation's Summary of the Visit to the Soviet Union and the Development of Relations with Communist and Workers' Parties of Various Countries." Amendola, Secretary of the Secretariat, made a report on the second item on the agenda: "Party Activities and Preparation for the Election Campaign."

In his report, Longo pointed out that the Italian Communist Party, in accordance with the resolutions of the Eighth Congress, exchanged delegations with Communist and Workers' Parties of other countries for visits. Longo said that these visits "gave us another opportunity to recognize the superiority of the socialist system over the capitalist system, and to recognize the broad significance of the experience gained by the Soviet Union, which was the first to realize the socialist revolution and is now advancing along the road of building communism."

Longo emphasized that the October Revolution opened up the road to socialism for everyone. The position of the Soviet Union and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union as leaders and main forces in the socialist world is a reality formed in the course of historical development, and it cannot be denied.

In his report, Amendola pointed out that the work of preparing for parliamentary elections in Italy has actually begun. After analyzing the domestic political situation in Italy, he pointed out that the task of the Italian Communist Party is to: "Reflect the masses' legitimate dissatisfaction with the mismanagement of the Christian Democratic Party, and therefore should study national issues more deeply and be good at pointing out correct solutions to these problems."

Amendola said: "We will participate in the election as a party that represents the demands of the nation because of its revolutionary spirit and internationalism, that is to say, it most resolutely opposes the Christian Democratic Party, strives to eliminate clerical rule in Italy, and strives for Italy to take the socialist road."

The plenary meeting discussed the reports of Longo and Amendola.

In the discussion, Pajetta, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Italian Communist Party, emphasized that the current tasks of the Italian Communists are: on the one hand, to carry out activities in the parliament, and on the other hand, to organize the masses to struggle, adopt a firm opposition stance, and powerfully expose all the negative aspects of clerical policies; at the same time, in close contact with the masses, formulate an election platform.

After the discussion, the meeting adopted resolutions on the reports of Longo and Amendola.

Xinhua News Agency, October 1st: At the plenary meeting of the Central Committee of the Italian Communist Party, the General Secretary of the Italian Communist Party, Togliatti, delivered a speech on the domestic and international situation in Italy and the party's policies.

Togliatti said that the international situation and the domestic situation in recent months have fully affirmed that the Italian Communist Party's Eighth Congress's assessment of the situation and its estimation of the future situation and prospects are correct.

Speaking of the domestic situation, Togliatti pointed out that the situation of the peasants is continuing to deteriorate. The wage issue and unemployment in Italian industry are very serious. For six months, workers' strikes have been occurring one after another. The seriousness of the issues of unemployment, labor protection, and accident insurance has not been eliminated.

Speaking of the Italian government's foreign policy, Togliatti said that Italy has never implemented an independent policy in many aspects directly related to its own national interests. Instead, it has followed the dictates of the United States. He pointed out that it is necessary to actively struggle to end this policy.

Togliatti pointed out that now, the Italian Communist Party is the target of concentrated attacks from all sides. The party's way to deal with this attack is to broadly unite the forces within and around the party to realize the resolutions of the Eighth Congress. At the same time, he emphasized that it is necessary to strengthen the international solidarity of the working class and strengthen the ties between the vanguard of the working class and the people of the world with the Soviet Union and other socialist countries. Togliatti said: "Our connection with the Soviet Union is our life."

    广泛组织群众进行斗争消灭教权统治
    意共中央讨论当前党的任务
    陶里亚蒂同志说：“同苏联的联系就是我们的生命！”
    据新华社1日讯  据塔斯社罗马讯：意大利共产党中央委员会从9月25日到28日举行了全体会议。意大利共产党副总书记隆哥就会议的第一项议程：“中央委员会代表团关于访问苏联和同各国共产党和工人党发展关系的总结”作了报告，书记处书记阿门多拉就第二项议程：“党的活动和筹备选举运动”作了报告。
    隆哥在他的报告中指出，意大利共产党根据第八次代表大会的决议，同其他国家的共产党和工人党互派代表团进行了访问。隆哥说，这些访问，“使我们又一次有机会认识到社会主义制度比资本主义制度优越，认识到第一个实现社会主义革命、现在正在沿着建设共产主义道路前进的苏联所取得的经验的广泛意义。”
    隆哥着重指出，十月革命为大家开辟了通向社会主义的道路。苏联和苏联共产党在社会主义世界中作为领袖和主要力量的地位是在历史发展中形成的实际情况，是不能否认的。
    阿门多拉在他的报告中指出，目前在意大利筹备议会选举的工作实际上已经开始。他在分析了意大利国内的政局后指出，意大利共产党的任务是：“反映群众对天主教民主党不良管理的正当不满，因此应该更加深入地研究国家的问题，要善于指出正确解决这些问题的办法。”
    阿门多拉说：“我们将作为这样一个党参加选举，它由于它的革命性和国际主义而代表了民族的要求，也就是说，它最坚决地反对天主教民主党，争取消灭意大利的教权统治，争取意大利走社会主义道路。”
    全体会议就隆哥和阿门多拉的报告进行了讨论。
    意共书记处书记巴叶塔在讨论中着重指出，意大利共产党员当前的任务是：一方面在议会中进行活动，一方面组织群众进行斗争，采取坚决的反对立场，有力地揭穿教权派政策的一切否定方面；同时在同群众的密切接触下制定竞选纲领。
    会议在进行讨论后就隆哥和阿门多拉的报告通过了决议。
    据新华社1日讯  意大利共产党总书记陶里亚蒂在意大利共产党中央委员会全体会议上就意大利国内外形势和党的政策发了言。
    陶里亚蒂说，最近几个月来的国际形势和国内情况完全肯定了意共第八次代表大会对局势的估计和对未来情况和前景的估计是正确的。
    陶里亚蒂在谈到国内情况时指出，农民的处境正在继续恶化。工资问题和意大利工业中失业问题非常严重。六个月来，工人罢工此起彼伏。失业、劳动保护和事故保险问题的严重性仍未消除。
    陶里亚蒂在谈到意大利政府的外交政策时说，意大利在同本国民族利益直接相关的许多方面，都从来没有实行过独立的政策。而是亦步亦趋地遵照美国的命令行事。他指出，必须为结束这种政策而积极斗争。
    陶里亚蒂指出，现在，意大利共产党是各方面集中攻击的对象。党对付这种攻击的办法是：使党内和党周围的力量广泛地团结起来以实现第八次代表大会的决议。他同时着重指出，必须全力加强工人阶级的国际团结，加强工人阶级先锋队和全世界人民同苏联和其他社会主义国家的联系。陶里亚蒂说：“同苏联的联系就是我们的生命。”
