    Su Weizhi and Qian Bosheng Collude with Each Other
    The anti-Party and anti-socialist crimes of Su Weizhi, the head of the Technical Department of the National Bureau of Measurement and a rightist within the Party, and Qian Bosheng, the deputy director of the Office, have been exposed.

    At the beginning of the rectification campaign, Su Weizhi viciously slandered the Party Group's work as "every inch of time is turned to ashes," and cursed that "the Bureau of Measurement is a dark and desolate desert." When Qian Bosheng and other rightist elements within the Party used the excuse that the rectification leading group was not effective in leading the rectification and "besieged" the leading group, Su immediately cooperated from within, declaring his withdrawal from the leading group. They also privately convened meetings of staff from the Office and the Technical Department to oppose the central government's directive that the anti-rightist struggle was a class struggle.

    They attacked the Party's emphasis on cadre policy. Before the rank assessment, Qian Bosheng wrote a letter to the Organization Department of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, arrogantly and shamelessly claiming that his assessment of virtue and talent was "definitely not below that of ordinary bureau directors." After the rectification campaign, he became even more arrogant, flagrantly slandering the leadership for promoting cadres based on "personal likes and dislikes." In fact, Qian was a person who had long been dissatisfied with the Party, passively resisted work, and outwardly agreed but inwardly opposed. Su Weizhi also shamelessly boasted that he was a piece of jade of Bian He, and possessed the talents of Mao Sui, Fan Ju, and Ban Chao, but was "submerged" under the cadre policy full of deviations.

    Under the stern criticism of the masses, Qian Bosheng has bowed his head and confessed his crimes, expressing his determination to thoroughly correct his past mistakes. Su Weizhi is also at the end of his rope.

    苏微之、钱泊生狼狈为奸
    国家计量局技术处处长，党内右派分子苏微之和办公室副主任钱泊生的反党反社会主义罪行已被揭露。
    整风开始，苏微之曾恶毒污蔑党组工作是“一寸光阴一寸灰”，辱骂“计量局是黑暗的大沙漠”。当钱泊生及党内其他右派分子借口整风领导小组领导整风不力，“围攻”领导小组时，苏即里应外合，声明退出领导小组。他们又曾私自召开办公室、技术处工作人员会议，反对中央提出的反右派是阶级斗争的指示。
    他们攻击党的重点是干部政策。在评级前，钱泊生就写信给中共中央组织部，狂妄无耻地提出自己论德论才“决不在一般厅局长之下”。整风后，他就更加嚣张，大肆污蔑领导上提拔干部是以“个人好恶”为标准。事实上钱是一个长期对党不满，消极怠工，阳奉阴违的人。苏微之也无耻地吹嘘自己是卞和之璧，毛遂、范睢、班超之才，在偏差备至的干部政策之下竟被“淹没”。
    在群众的严词批驳下，钱泊生已低头认罪，表示要痛改前非。苏微之也已理屈词穷。
