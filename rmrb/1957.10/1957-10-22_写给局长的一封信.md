    A Letter to the Bureau Chief
    Yun Hai
    One day, I happened to find a letter on a rectification wall newspaper in an agency, a seemingly ordinary letter, which made me unable to stop reading it all the way through, and I very carefully copied it word for word.
    It was a letter like this:
    Comrade Bureau Chief:
    I don't know your surname, and you certainly don't know me. My name is Zhou Jingui, and I am a salesperson at the No. 4 Joint State-Private Partnership Canteen. Our canteen is in the middle of the night market, and you may have been there.
    I have been in this line of work for almost four years. Before the joint partnership, this place was called "Shuangxingju," famous for its braised pork. Chef Sun had several signature dishes, and everyone on the street knew his skills. Back then, many cadres and officers were regular customers here, but the ones I was most familiar with were Director Ma and Old Hu from your bureau. At that time, they would come to patronize us almost every week, sometimes together, sometimes one coming early to wait for the other, without fail. At that time, the owner, Wang Wu, treated them very warmly, truly accommodating in every way, providing whatever they wanted. The portions were larger than others, and if they wanted wine, he would personally go out to get it. If they were short on money, they could even get credit. Wang Wu called "Director Hu" so sweetly! Although he knew very well that Old Hu was not a director.
    If you say that Wang Wu was genuinely friendly with them, that's nonsense. At that time, businessmen only cared about money. They would bow to the god of wealth. But as the saying goes: the wool comes from the sheep, and you find what you lose where you lost it. If your Director Ma and Old Hu weren't so generous, drinking without a care in the world, Wang Wu would never have been so generous to them. Isn't that obvious?
    Last year, the business became a joint partnership. Wang Wu was transferred to the company to handle business, but Chef Sun and I stayed, still here. The old customers still came as usual, and Old Hu and Director Ma still came for a drink now and then. Logically speaking, cadres getting together in twos and threes on holidays to drink and have fun is nothing, especially for those of us in this line of work, it seems even less significant. Life has improved, after all! But I am increasingly displeased with the way Old Hu and the other drink. Originally, it was only three or five liang, at most one jin. But lately, they don't drink, but when they do, it's endless, sitting for one or two hours. Sometimes, they get so drunk that they stagger, vomit all over the table and floor, and their tongues become stiff, yet they still pound the table and shout for wine. One night, Old Hu got completely drunk and collapsed. It took several people a great deal of effort to drag and push him onto a pedicab. He collapsed in the carriage, constantly vomiting "Wah! Wah!" while shouting for me to get him "Wujiapi."
    I'm not surprised to see people get drunk in restaurants. Some even smash plates, and some even curse. What I can't stand is that once they see alcohol, they forget everything, open the floodgates of talk, and chatter endlessly, talking about everything. If it were just idle chatter, that would be fine, but they don't. They talk about the people and things in your bureau, leaving nothing out. The more they talk, the more excited they get, and the more interesting it becomes. Sometimes they laugh heartily after talking, sometimes they scold and grumble, either arguing loudly or whispering. Think about it! Comrade Bureau Chief, all kinds of people come to restaurants, who knows who does what. Some things, if heard by outsiders, I'm afraid it wouldn't be good!
    To be honest, I have never deliberately tried to listen, but just in the process of serving dishes and adding wine, I have heard a lot of news from your bureau, of course, all incomplete. If you don't believe me, let me try to say it: There is a female comrade in your bureau named Little Cai, who definitely loves to dress up, and she has had more than one boyfriend, right? Also, your branch secretary's surname is definitely Huang, and I guarantee that Section Chief Zhang has prejudices against him. And Old Hu thinks he earns less, and he dares to compare his abilities with his section chief. I don't know if you've heard of this? I've heard a lot of news like this. Director Ma even talked about how Stalin was... I won't mention much here, but anyway, there are some things that I have never heard.
    Comrade Bureau Chief, I don't understand grand principles. Although I have joined the trade union and attended night school, my awareness is not very high. However, I always feel that your Director Ma and Old Hu have a bad habit, not distinguishing between inside and outside, and talking about everything everywhere. People say: words slip after drinking, have they also slipped up, do you think?
    Bureau Chief, the meaning of my writing this letter is to report this situation to you, so that you can help them when you have time, and help them change in the future. I wrote it in a rambling way, and the words are not very coherent. Bureau Chief, please don't laugh at me. My foundation is weak – I haven't even graduated from elementary school. This letter was written after asking my neighbor – an elementary school teacher – to help me revise it again and again.
        I wish you progress in your work.
            Zhou Jingui, Service Staff of the No. 4 Joint State-Private Partnership Canteen

### 写给局长的一封信

    写给局长的一封信
    云海
    一天，我偶尔在一个机关的整风墙报上发现了一封信，一封看来很普通的信，使我不能不一气看到底，并且很认真地把它逐字逐句抄了下来。
    是这样一封信：局长同志：
    我不知道您姓什么，您当然也不认识我。我叫周金贵，是公私合营第四食堂的营业员，我们食堂在夜市中间，您可能也来过。
    我干这行快四年了。合营以前，这儿叫“双兴居”，酱肉做的出名，灶上孙师傅有几样拿手菜，街面上没有不知道他的手艺的。那阵，不少干部和军官是这里的主顾，可我最熟悉的要算你们局里的马科长和老胡。那时候，他们几乎每个礼拜要来照顾一次，有时一块儿来，有时先来等后到的，不见不散。当时，掌柜的王五待他们亲近的很，真是无可无不可，吃啥有啥，菜码比别人的大，要酒，亲自外处去打，腰里不宽绰可以赊账。王五一口一个“胡科长”叫的可甜啦！虽然他明知道老胡并不是科长。
    若说王五是真心实意的和他们要好，那是胡扯。那时，买卖人看中的是钱，见着财神爷还有不作揖的。可俗语说的好：羊毛出在羊身上，哪儿丢的哪儿找。若不是你们的马科长和老胡手头那么敞，喝起酒来不管天地，王五决不会对他们那么大方，这不是明摆着的事。
    去年，买卖合营了。王五调到公司里搞业务去了，灶上孙师傅和我都没动，还留在这里。老主顾还是照样来，老胡和马科长还不时的来喝一通。按理说，干部们到了礼拜假日，三两人凑在一块儿，喝喝乐乐，算不了什么，特别是干我们这行的，看来更不算回事，生活提高了嘛！可是老胡他俩的喝法，我愈来愈看不惯了。原先还只是三、五两，最多也不过一斤。可近来是不喝便罢，一喝就是没完没了，坐下就是一两个钟头。有时候，喝得东倒西歪、吐个满桌满地，舌头都喝硬了，还拍着桌子，喊着要酒。一天夜里，老胡喝了个人仰马翻，几个人费了好大劲，连推带拖才强把他扶到三轮上。他瘫在车厢里，嘴里不住的“哇！哇！”吐着，还直嚷嚷叫我去打“五加皮”去。
    在饭馆里喝醉了酒，我倒不稀奇，有的还连盘子都扣了，甚至有的还骂人呢。我看不惯的是他俩一见了酒，就什么都忘了，打开话匣子，咧咧起来没个完，啥都讲。如果光是闲扯，倒也罢了，可他俩偏不，你们局里的人和事，没有讲不到的，愈讲愈来劲，愈讲愈有滋味。有时候讲一通哈哈大笑，有时候讲着讲着又骂骂滋滋的，不是大吵大嚷，就是嘀嘀咕咕。您想啊！局长同志，酒饭茶市里什么人不来，谁知道谁是干什么的。有些话，叫闲杂人听了去，怕不大好罢！
    说实在的，我倒没有一次想故意听声，可就是上菜添酒这工夫，我也听来了不少你们局里的新闻，当然都是丢头拉尾巴的。不信，我说说试试：你们局里有个叫小蔡的女同志，准爱打扮，对象也搞了不止一个，对不对？还有你们的支部书记准姓黄，管保张科长对他有成见。还有老胡嫌他赚的少，他敢和他的科长比能耐大小，这个不知道您听说过没有？像这样的新闻，我还听到不少。甚至，马科长还讲过斯大林怎么怎么的……这里我就不多提了，反正有些话，我是从来没听到的。
    局长同志，大道理我不懂，虽然我入了工会，上了夜校，可觉悟还不大高。但是，我总觉得你们这位马科长和老胡这种毛病不好，不分家里外头，啥事都到处乱讲。人家都说：酒后失言，是不是他俩也失了言了，您说？
    局长，我写这封信的意思，是要把这个情况向您汇报汇报，让您有空能帮助帮助他俩，往后改着点。我写的啰里啰嗦，话也不通的很，局长，您可别见笑，我原先的底儿空——小学还没毕业。这封信还是求我的邻居——一位小学教员帮助我改了又改才写出来的。
        祝您工作进步
            公私合营第四食堂服务员  周金贵草
