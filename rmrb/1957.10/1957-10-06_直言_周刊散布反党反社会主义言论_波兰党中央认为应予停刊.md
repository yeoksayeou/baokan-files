Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, 5th: The Polish Press Agency published a communique on the 4th, stating that the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, having considered the decision made by the General Administration of Press to order the suspension of the "Straight Talk" weekly, believes that this decision is correct. The Secretariat is aware of the attitude of the editorial department on this matter, the majority of whom are party members.

The Secretariat said that the editorial department of "Straight Talk" weekly—including some party members—has for many months been engaged in activities opposing the implementation of the resolutions passed by the main organs of the Party, adopting an unprofitable and negative attitude, using erroneous views to describe the actual political and economic situation in our country, spreading doubts about the reality of building socialism, and propagating bourgeois views on many issues.

Despite the many words and warnings from the representatives of the Party Central Committee, the activities of the "Straight Talk" weekly editorial department and its party members have not only failed to improve, but have intensified. A particularly obvious piece of evidence to illustrate this is the September issue of "Straight Talk" weekly, the content of which attacks the policies of the Party and the government in a very arrogant and provocative manner, absurdly and inaccurately describes the economic and political situation in our country, and advocates views that are completely incompatible with socialism.

The Secretariat of the Party Central Committee, having considered all these circumstances, believes that the decision made by the General Administration of Press to order the suspension of "Straight Talk" weekly is correct, and has suggested that the Party Central Committee's Inspection Committee study this issue and take organizational disciplinary measures against the party members in the "Straight Talk" weekly editorial department.

    “直言”周刊散布反党反社会主义言论
    波兰党中央认为应予停刊
    据新华社华沙5日电　波兰通讯社在4日发表一项公报说，波兰统一工人党中央委员会书记处考虑了报业管理总局作出的勒令“直言”周刊停刊的决定，认为这个决定是正确的。书记处已经知道了编辑部在这个问题上的态度，编辑部的人员大多数是党员。
    书记处说，“直言”周刊的编辑部——包括一些党员在内——许多个月来一直在进行反对执行党的主要机构所通过的决议的活动，采取一种无益的、消极的态度，用错误的观点来叙述我国的实际的政治和经济情况，散布对于建设社会主义的现实的怀疑，并且在许多问题上宣扬资产阶级观点。
    尽管党中央的代表费了许多口舌和作了许多警告，“直言”周刊编辑部和其中的党员的活动不仅没有什么改进，反而变本加厉起来。一个能够说明这一点的特别明显的证据是在9月份付印的一期“直言”周刊，这一期的内容以一种非常嚣张的和挑衅的方式攻击党和政府的政策，荒谬地和失实地叙述我国的经济和政治局势，鼓吹与社会主义十分不相容的观点。
    党中央书记处考虑了这一切情况，认为报业管理总局作出的勒令“直言”周刊停刊的决定是正确的，已建议党中央检查委员会研究这个问题，并且对“直言”周刊编辑部的党员采取党的组织处分。
