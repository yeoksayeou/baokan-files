The Great Debate Brings a New Atmosphere

    Hua Feng Cooperative Decides to Sell All 300,000 Jin of Surplus Grain to the State

    (Our Newspaper’s Report) The Hua Feng Agricultural Cooperative in Dahechuan Township, Yongji County, Jilin Province, has achieved a bumper harvest of all crops this year, with the exception of the thirty hectares of late-transplanted paddy fields which suffered reduced production. The total grain output has greatly surpassed that of last year.

    Before the Great Debate, some cooperative members, and even a few cooperative cadres, blindly followed the well-to-do middle peasants in clamoring, "This year our cooperative has a bumper harvest, so we should keep more grain to be more comfortable." Some even said, "This year, it's enough to complete the grain procurement task; the rest should be divided among the cooperative members." The cooperative Party branch, with the specific assistance of the township general branch, conducted education on the grain policy of "public before private" and "using surplus to make up for deficiency" for the cooperative cadres and the broad masses of cooperative members through the Great Debate. After heated discussions among the cooperative members, it was unanimously agreed to sell all the surplus grain to the state.

    This year, the total grain output of the entire cooperative is expected to reach more than 2,452,000 jin. After deducting 380,000 jin for agricultural tax, 800,000 jin for the population's consumption, 110,000 jin for feed, 120,000 jin for seeds, and 660,000 jin for the "three fixed" grain procurement task, there will still be a surplus of 300,000 jin, which has been decided to be sold entirely to the state.

    华丰社三十万斤余粮
    决定全部卖给国家
    本报讯　吉林省永吉县大河川乡华丰农业社，今年除晚插秧的三十公顷水田减产外，其他作物普遍获得丰收，粮食总产量大大超过去年。
    在大辩论前，有部分社员甚至有少数社干部也盲目跟着富裕中农吵嚷说：“今年咱们社丰收了，可得多留一些粮食宽裕宽裕。”还有的说：“今年完成征购粮任务就行啦，剩下的给社员分一分。”社党分支部在乡总支具体帮助下，通过大辩论，对社干部和广大社员进行了“先公后私”“以丰补歉”的粮食方针的教育。经过社员热烈讨论，一致同意把全部余粮卖给国家。
    今年全社粮食总产量可达到二百四十五万二千多斤，扣出农业税三十八万斤、人口留量八十万斤、饲料十一万斤、种籽十二万斤、“三定”购粮任务六十六万斤等等，还可以有余粮三十万斤，决定全部卖给国家。
