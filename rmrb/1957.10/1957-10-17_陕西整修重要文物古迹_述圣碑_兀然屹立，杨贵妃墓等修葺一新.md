Shaanxi Province is preparing to renovate over twenty important cultural relics and historic sites this year. The Sima Qian Tomb, Yang Guifei Tomb, Wuhou Tomb, Du Gong Temple, Caotang Temple, and Laomu Temple are among the six sites that have already been completely finished. The Qianling "Stele Describing Sage," also known as the "Seven-Section Stele" (each section weighing more than fifteen tons), which has always been considered the tallest and of great historical value, had been toppled for over a century. It was generally believed to be impossible to erect, but it was restored to its original position in August this year and now stands tall and upright. The Banpo Village Yangshao Culture Site in Xi'an, which was scientifically excavated in 1954 and is the most completely preserved, with the richest artifacts unearthed, and vividly reflects the production and life of people in primitive society, will be completely renovated and protected by November this year, and will be opened as China's first site museum. More than a dozen other cultural relics and historic sites are still undergoing renovation and restoration.

　　陕西整修重要文物古迹
    “述圣碑”兀然屹立，杨贵妃墓等修葺一新
    陕西省准备在年内整修二十多处重要文物古迹。现在已经全部完工的有司马迁墓、杨贵妃墓、武侯墓、杜公祠、草堂寺、老母殿等六处。向来被人们认为最高大，而且具有高度历史价值的乾陵“述圣碑”，又名“七截碑”（每截重十五吨多），倒塌已经一百多年，均认为无法立起，但在今年8月间恢复了原来的位置，兀然屹立。1954年经过科学发掘，保存最完整、出土物最丰富、而且能够生动的反映出原始社会人们的生产和生活情况的西安半坡村仰韶期文化遗址，在今年11月间即可全部修建保护完工，开辟为我国第一座遗址博物馆。还有十几处文物古迹，目前尚在继续进行整修和恢复中。
