Xinhua News Agency, 5th dispatch: During the period of the First Five-Year Plan, China's financial undertaking achieved enormous development. At present, the People's Bank of China has 20,000 branches, plus 100,000 rural credit cooperatives, forming a massive socialist financial network. It has become a powerful tool for promoting socialist construction and socialist transformation.

During the First Five-Year Plan period, the total amount of agricultural loans issued by the state banks reached 6.8 billion yuan, equivalent to approximately 97 billion catties of grain. Calculated according to the total number of peasant households in the country, the average loan per household was more than 56 yuan. Farmers who received these loans paid 1.74 billion yuan less in interest than they would have with private loans. In order to support agricultural cooperativization, the state banks issued 3.1 billion yuan in loans in 1956, including poverty alleviation cooperative fund loans, helping more than 40 million poor and lower-middle peasant households pay their share fund for joining cooperatives. In addition, 1.04 billion yuan in basic construction and production expense loans were issued to agricultural cooperatives, helping agricultural cooperatives build water conservancy projects, purchase means of production, and promote the development of agricultural production.

The task required by the National Agricultural Development Program (Draft) of one credit cooperative per township was achieved one year ahead of schedule in 1956. In 1956, there were 100,000 rural credit cooperatives across the country, with 96.18 million peasant households joining. At present, credit cooperatives have more than 1.3 billion yuan in shares and deposits, and the cumulative amount of loans issued has reached more than 2.7 billion yuan. Over the past few years, this mass financial organization has worked with state banks to help impoverished farmers overcome difficulties in production and life, basically eliminated usury exploitation in rural areas, and become a powerful assistant to state banks in rural areas.

Supporting the socialist transformation of handicrafts and private industry and commerce is also one of the main tasks of state banks. The state banks lend 65% of their loans to state-owned commercial enterprises and supply and marketing cooperatives to support them in implementing unified purchase and sales, acquiring industrial and agricultural products, controlling materials, stabilizing markets, and strengthening the socialist economy in the field of circulation, which is conducive to the transformation of capitalist industry and commerce. In 1956, the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce and handicrafts reached a high tide. In this year, state bank loans to joint state-private industrial and commercial enterprises and handicrafts increased by more than two times compared with 1955, supporting them in expanding production and commodity circulation, and promoting the further consolidation of the socialist transformation cause.

Over the past few years, state banks have financially guaranteed the needs of continuous development of socialist industry. It is estimated that by the end of 1957, bank loans to state-owned industries will increase by 2.8 times compared with 1952.

In order to mobilize mass funds and make them beneficial to the national economy and people's livelihood, state banks have widely carried out savings business. By the end of June this year, urban people's savings in banks reached more than 2.48 billion yuan, an increase of more than two times compared with the end of 1952.

To adapt to the needs of national economic development, state banks also plan and adjust currency circulation in a planned way, so that the issuance and withdrawal of currency are conducive to the development of the national economy. This is mainly reflected in: organizing currency withdrawals in the first half of each year to stabilize the market, and issuing currency in the second half of the year to support national procurement, adapting to seasonal needs; issuing new Renminbi in 1955, eliminating the remnants of long-term inflation before liberation, and laying the foundation for organizing currency circulation in a planned way.

    社会主义金融网遍及城乡
    五年发放农业贷款六十八亿元
    新华社5日讯　我国金融事业在第一个五年计划期间获得巨大发展。目前中国人民银行拥有两万个分支机构，加上农村的十万个信用合作社，形成了一个庞大的社会主义金融网。它成为促进社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业的有力工具。
    在第一个五年计划期间，国家银行发放农业贷款总数达六十八亿元，约合九百七十亿斤粮食，按全国农户总数计算，平均每户贷款五十六元多。农民得到这笔贷款，比私人借贷要少付利息十七亿四千万元。为了支持农业合作化，国家银行在1956年就发放了贷款三十一亿元，其中发放的贫农合作基金贷款，帮助四千多万户贫农和下中农缴纳了入社股份基金。另外发放给农业社的十亿四千万元基本建设和生产费用贷款，帮助农业社兴建了水利工程，购买了生产资料，促进了农业生产的发展。
    全国农业发展纲要（草案）所要求的每乡一个信用合作社的任务，已经提前一年在1956年实现。1956年全国农村已有信用合作社十万个，入社农户达九千六百一十八万户。目前信用社拥有股金和存款十三亿多元，放款累计达二十七亿多元。这个群众性的金融组织，几年来配合国家银行帮助贫困农民克服了生产和生活上的困难，基本上消灭了农村的高利贷剥削，成为国家银行在农村的有力助手。
    支持手工业和私营工商业的社会主义改造，也是国家银行的主要任务之一。国家银行把它的贷款的65％贷给国营商业和供销合作社，支持它们实行统购统销，收购工农业产品，掌握物资，稳定市场，增强社会主义经济在流通领域的力量，有利于对资本主义工商业进行改造。1956年，私营工商业和手工业社会主义改造达到高潮，这一年国家银行对公私合营工商业和手工业的贷款比1955年增加了两倍多，支持它们扩大生产和商品流转，促进社会主义改造事业进一步巩固。
    几年来，国家银行在资金上保证了社会主义工业不断发展的需要。预计到1957年底，银行对国营工业的贷款将比1952年增加二点八倍。
    为了动员群众资金，使之有利于国计民生事业，国家银行广泛开展了储蓄业务。今年6月底，城市人民储蓄在银行的款项达到二十四亿八千多万元，比1952年底增加两倍多。
    国家银行适应国民经济发展的需要，还有计划地组织和调剂货币流通，使货币的投放和回笼有利于国民经济的发展。这主要表现在：每年适应季节性需要，上半年组织货币回笼，以稳定市场，下半年投放货币，支持国家收购；在1955年发行了新的人民币，消除了解放前长期通货膨胀的残余影响，为有计划地组织货币流通奠定了基础。
