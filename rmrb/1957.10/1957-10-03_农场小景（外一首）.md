    A Farm Scene
    (and another poem)
    Wei Ming
    Tibetan people come to learn the seven-inch walking plow,
    A mother carries her child on her back,
    The child is even more restless than at home,
    Constantly squirming and fussing on her back.
    Does the child want to eat tsampa again?
    Or is it uncomfortable staying on her back?
    Ask the child, it's nothing of the sort,
    Then why is it like this...?
    The child only pokes its head out,
    To watch its mother learn to hold the plow;
    Child, be quiet, what are you looking at so intently,
    Do you also want to watch and help Mom?

    农场小景
    （外一首）
    未名
    藏族人民来学七吋步犁，
    母亲把孩子背在背上，
    孩子比在家里还不安宁，
    尽在背上乱幌乱嚷。
    是孩子又想吃糌粑？
    还是呆在背上不舒畅？
    问问孩子什么都不是，
    又为什么会这样……
    孩子只扒出来脑袋，
    把母亲学扶犁的样子望望；
    孩子，安静些，尽望些什么，
    你也想看会，帮帮妈的忙？
