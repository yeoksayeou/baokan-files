    One Year After the October Event
    By Our Correspondent Hu Jibang
    The Hungarian counter-revolutionary event has already passed its first anniversary. U.S. imperialism originally intended to use the United Nations to launch another anti-Soviet, anti-communist storm on the eve of the anniversary, in order to cover up its new aggression in the Middle East, but its plot failed. However, the imperialist bloc is not willing to abandon its anti-communist, anti-Soviet plan. Now, the mayors of major U.S. cities have decided to hold a "commemoration" meeting on October 23rd. The Third Latin American Anti-Communist Congress, held a month ago, decided that October 23rd would be an anti-communist memorial day. The World Confederation of Free Trade Unions has also declared this day to be the so-called "Hungarian Solidarity Day." Hungarian counter-revolutionary groups in exile will also engage in large-scale activities on this day. This "enthusiastic" behavior of the imperialist reactionaries and their Hungarian pawns is enough to illustrate whether the nature of the Hungarian event was a revolution or a counter-revolution.
    Due to the consolidation of the Hungarian Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government and its great achievements over the past year, it is impossible for the enemies inside and outside Hungary to provoke another armed riot. Today, Hungary's armed forces, the Party, government, trade unions, youth leagues, enterprises, and universities have learned from last year's lessons and greatly increased their vigilance. Workers' self-defense forces at all levels are diligently conducting air defense and shooting exercises. They are fully prepared for any unexpected provocations that may occur.
    Precisely because of this, the enemy can now only issue some simple handwritten leaflets. Western radio has also lowered its tone, only asking Hungarians to wear black纱 (纱 in this context means crepe) and light candles on this day to show "mourning." To adapt to the new situation, the enemy has changed its previous strategy of open confrontation. But it should be stated that a large number of exiled criminals abroad, with Western funding, are conducting espionage and military training. The remaining counter-revolutionary elements who have gone underground in the country are also waiting for an opportunity to carry out sabotage activities internally. Therefore, the Hungarian people must not forget the date of October 23rd. Only by being vigilant against the enemy's tricks in every way and drawing profound lessons from the painful events can we prevent the recurrence of similar events.
    One of the biggest lessons of last year's Hungarian event is that the Party did not openly expose and struggle against the thoughts and activities of the right-wing groups in the past, to the point that it developed beyond control. Due to the nationalist and populist ideas in the cultural and propaganda teams represented by the Writers' Association, the relatively widespread social democratic influence received by the working class, and the erroneous influence of the right-leaning line of Nagy Imre during his tenure as Chairman of the Council of Ministers in 1953 and 1954 in the Party and government departments, right-wing opportunism has long had a broad social base in Hungary. In the spring of 1956, after the 20th Congress of the CPSU, under the slogans of opposing past mistakes and demanding "democratization," revisionist thought flooded the intellectual class like a broken dam. Nagy Imre used two weapons: the people's dissatisfaction with social life and the Party's mistakes in the Rajk case. He used the former to split the unity of the Party and the people, and the latter to split the unity within the Party, especially to provoke splits among the upper-level leadership. At the same time, Nagy Imre himself appeared as a corrector of errors, gathering various forces opposing the old leadership, opposing the Party, and opposing the socialist system around himself. Therefore, ideologically and actionally, he naturally formed an alliance with imperialism and fascism.
    Through the propaganda of the Petőfi Circle, young intellectuals increasingly became prisoners of the Nagy Imre group. Renowned old writers and journalists, as well as Western radio, "praised" the youth as heroes leading the national revolution, and authoritative professors also encouraged the adventurous actions of the students. The Nagy Imre group used the mobilization and arming of the youth as a tool to seize power. The fascist groups used criminals in prisons and urban hooligans as their shock troops. Nagy Imre served as a transitional bridge for the restoration of fascism. Young students acted as a mass screen for the armed offensive of fascism. When the parade on the 23rd began, the composition of the ranks changed within an hour or two. The leadership quickly passed into the hands of extreme right-wingers and fascists, and young students became blind followers of armed provocations. Fascist armed provocations and offensives often used mass parades as a cover. This caused great difficulties for the healthy forces determined to eliminate the counter-revolution. Due to the complexity of the situation, and due to the pressure of the "masses," honest communists were forced to make concessions and be burdened with concerns. The Party leadership failed to distinguish between the legitimate demands of the people and the reactionary slogans of the right-wing and counter-revolutionary elements, nor did it analyze the composition of the "masses." Almost everyone was more or less influenced by revisionism, and therefore showed a right-leaning and compromising attitude of the entire leadership at the critical moment. Nagy Imre threatened the Party with the "masses" everywhere, fearing bloodshed and fearing to agitate the emotions of the masses. As a result, he disarmed himself step by step, clearing the way for the rapid advance of fascism.
    What the Nagy Imre group planned was to regress to the system of the Hungarian coalition government before 1948, while the purpose of imperialism and the bourgeoisie was to restore the fascist dictatorship before 1945. When the event developed to the final stage and the fascists were preparing to abandon Nagy Imre, Nagy Imre did not hesitate to call the fascists "my children" in a begging attitude, asking to retain his leading position in any counter-revolutionary government.
    On the eve of the event, the Party newspaper "Szabad Nép" (Free People), which had become the mouthpiece of the Nagy Imre group, also suffered the same fate. On October 23rd, it published an editorial entitled "New Spring Review," praising this anti-Party movement of the youth as the revolutionary movement led by the youth on March 15, 1848. On the 29th, it published an editorial entitled "Day Breaks," "cheering" the withdrawal of Soviet troops and calling the armed rioters "freedom fighters." However, these right-wing elements in the editorial department, although they did their utmost to fawn on the enemy, were eventually closed down by the fascist leader Dudás.
    Thus, the fallacy promoted by revisionists that intellectuals should replace the working class as the leading class of society, especially the praise of the leading role of young college students, went bankrupt in the hours after the October event. This proves that all the theories of revisionists are just illusions, and they are ruthlessly crushed in the sharp class struggle.
    In the Hungarian event, the revisionists and right-wing elements have completed their own path. Their ghost faces, which have been appearing and hiding in the Party for decades, were revealed in a few days. Therefore, it is a very useful mirror for all right-leaning elements.

    十月事件一周年
    本报记者　胡济邦
    匈牙利反革命事件已经爆发一周年了。美帝国主义本想在一周年前夕利用联合国再来发动一次反苏反共的风暴，以掩护它在中东发动的新侵略，结果它的阴谋是失败了。但是，帝国主义集团并不甘心于放弃自己的反共反苏计划。现在，美国各大城市的市长们已决定在10月23日这一天举行“纪念”会。一个月前召开的拉丁美洲第三届反共代表大会上，决定10月23日为反共纪念日。世界黄色工会也宣布这一天为所谓“匈牙利团结日”。匈牙利流亡国外的反革命团体也将在这一天大肆活动。帝国主义反动派及其匈牙利走卒们的这种“热情”表现，就足以说明匈牙利事件的性质究竟是革命还是反革命的了。
    由于匈牙利工农革命政府的巩固和它一年来所取得的巨大成就，已使匈牙利国内外敌人没有可能再来挑起一次武装暴乱事件。今天匈牙利的武装力量，匈牙利的党、政、工、团、企业以及各大学已吸取了去年的教训，大大提高了警惕。各级工人自卫队正在勤奋地进行防空和射击演习。他们对于可能发生的一切意外挑衅，已经有了充分的准备。
    正因为这样，敌人现在就只能发出一些简单的手抄传单。西方广播也已放低语调，只要求匈牙利人在这一天缠上黑纱，点着蜡烛，以示“哀悼”。敌人为适应新的情况，已改变前一阶段公开对抗的策略。但是应该说明，现在国外的大批流亡罪犯，在西方的资助下正进行着间谍和军事训练。已经转入地下的国内的反革命残余，也在等待时机，打算在内部进行破坏活动。因此，匈牙利人民仍然不能忘记10月23日这个日子。只有多方警惕敌人的鬼计，从惨痛的事件中得出深刻的教训，才能防止类似事件的重演。
    去年匈牙利事件的一个最大的教训，是党在过去对右派集团的思想和活动，没有公开进行揭发和斗争，以至于发展到不可收拾的地步。由于以作家协会为代表的文教宣传队伍中的民族主义和民粹派的思想，工人阶级队伍中所受到的较为普遍的社会民主主义影响，党和政府部门中受纳吉1953和1954年任部长会议主席期间右倾路线错误的影响，使得右倾机会主义长期以来在匈牙利就有广泛的社会基础。1956年春天，在苏共第二十次代表大会以后，在反对过去错误和要求“民主化”的口号下，修正主义思想首先在知识分子阶层像决堤似地泛滥开来了。纳吉利用了两个武器，就是人民对社会生活的不满和党在拉伊克案件中的错误。他利用前者来分裂党和人民的团结，利用后者来分裂党内的团结，特别是挑起上层领导之间的分裂。与此同时，纳吉自己却以纠正错误者的面目出现，把反对旧领导，反对党和反对社会主义制度的各种力量纠合在自己的周围。因此在思想上和行动上也就很自然地和帝国主义及法西斯结成了同盟。
    青年知识分子通过裴多菲俱乐部的宣传，越来越多地变成了纳吉集团的俘虏。有名望的老作家和记者，以及西方的广播，都“歌颂”青年是领导民族革命的英雄，有权威的教授们也鼓励学生们的冒险行动。纳吉集团以发动青年、武装青年作为自己夺取政权的工具。法西斯集团把监牢里的罪犯和城市的流氓充当自己的突击队。纳吉为法西斯复辟担任过渡的桥梁。青年学生为法西斯的武装进攻充当掩护的群众。当23日的游行开始一、二小时后，队伍的成分已起了变化。领导权很快就转到了极右分子和法西斯分子的手中，青年学生变成了武装挑衅的盲从者。法西斯的武装挑衅和进攻，经常是利用群众的游行来打掩护的。这就给决心要消灭反革命的一部分健康力量造成了极大的困难。由于形势的复杂，由于“群众”的压力，迫使正直的共产党人也节节退让和顾虑重重。而党的领导既未分清人民群众的正当要求和右派及反革命分子的反动口号，也未分析“群众”的成分，几乎绝大多数人都或多或少地受到了修正主义的影响，因而在紧要关头时表现出整个领导的右倾和妥协。纳吉处处以“群众”威胁党，怕群众流血，怕激动群众的情绪。结果就一步步解除了自己的武装，为法西斯扫清了迅速前进的道路。
    纳吉集团筹划的，是倒退到1948年以前的匈牙利联合政府时期的制度，而帝国主义和资产阶级的目的，却是要使1945年以前的法西斯独裁复辟。当事件发展到最后阶段、法西斯分子准备抛弃纳吉时，纳吉就不惜以求乞的态度称法西斯分子为“我的孩子”，要求保留他在任何反革命政府中的领导岗位。
    在事件前夕，已变成纳吉集团的喉舌的党报“自由人民报”，也遭到了同样的命运。它在10月23日发表了以“新的春季检阅”为题的社论，对青年的这次反党运动誉为1848年3月15日青年领导的革命运动。29日又发表了以“天亮了”为题的社论，“欢呼”苏军的撤退，把武装暴徒称为“自由战士”。但是，编辑部的这些右派分子虽然对敌人极尽奴颜婢膝之能事，最后还是被法西斯头子杜达什封闭停刊。
    就这样，修正主义者所提倡的知识分子应代替工人阶级为社会的领导阶级的谬论，特别是对青年大学生的领导作用的歌颂，在十月事件发生后的几个小时中就破产了。这证明修正主义者的一切理论只是幻想，它们在尖锐的阶级斗争中都被无情地粉碎了。
    在匈牙利事件中，修正主义者和右派分子已走完了自己的道路。他们几十年来时隐时现、躲藏在党内的鬼面目，在几天之内就原形毕露了。因此，它对一切右倾分子是一面极有用的镜子。
