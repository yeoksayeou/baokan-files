Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 16th - The day after the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge officially opened to traffic, the Yangtze River encountered Force 8 gales, with white-crested waves surging across the river. Wuhan City raised a notice saying, "Strong winds and high waves, ferry service suspended." However, the Yangtze River Bridge received trains, cars, and a continuous stream of people traveling north and south.

Today's Yangtze River surface is no longer the scene described by the Tang Dynasty poet Li Bai: "White waves like mountains, how can one cross? Fierce winds worry the skilled sailors."

From 6:00 PM on the 15th to 6:00 PM today, the Yangtze River Bridge has already carried eleven passenger trains, freight trains, and special trains. According to the original plan, the Yangtze River Bridge would not begin carrying freight trains until after October 20th. However, today, the fierce winds and giant waves on the Yangtze River broke the cables of the train ferry connecting the Jinghan and Yuehan Railways. The ferry with the strongest horsepower at the ferry terminal, the "Beijing," could not control its course, and the ferry service had to be suspended at noon. Thus, this afternoon, two freight trains traveling north and south exceptionally crossed the Yangtze River Bridge ahead of schedule. These two freight trains brought steel plates from the north and sleepers from the south to some factories in Wuhan, and transported rice from the south to the north.

Today, on the road surface of the Yangtze River Bridge, various vehicles, large and small, passed by like flowing water. Many vehicles were loaded with goods such as steel, timber, oil, grain, and pastries. According to relevant management personnel, several hundred vehicles cross the Yangtze River in the Wuhan area every day; whenever a Force 5 wind blows, or there is heavy snow or heavy fog, the ferry service has to be suspended, and the cars have to stop there and wait. But today, all the cars sped across the Yangtze River Bridge.

The new bus route opened by the Wuhan Public Transport Company, connecting the three towns of Wuhan, started at dawn today, carrying workers, cadres, and citizens to and from work with a frequency of one bus every four minutes. In the past, Wuhan residents had to take ferries and wooden boats to cross the river, but today they all safely crossed the Yangtze River Bridge.

Xinhua News Agency, 16th - The China-Indonesia Friendship Association received a congratulatory telegram from the Indonesia-China Friendship Association on the 15th, congratulating the opening of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge. The telegram said: "We extend our congratulations on the opening ceremony of the Yangtze River Bridge today, and hope that China will achieve the same success in other areas."

Xinhua News Agency, 16th - The Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries received a congratulatory telegram from Mason, the head of the New Zealand-China Friendship Association delegation visiting Guangzhou, on the 15th, congratulating the opening of the Yangtze River Bridge. He said in the telegram: "The New Zealand-China Friendship Association delegation joins the Chinese people in congratulating the great achievement of the Yangtze River Bridge."

Xinhua News Agency, 16th - The National Committee of the First Machine Industry Trade Union of China received a congratulatory telegram from the All-Japan Metal Workers' Union of the Japan Council of Metal Workers' Unions on the 15th, congratulating the official opening of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge.

The All-Japan Metal Workers' Union's telegram said: "Congratulations on the completion of the Yangtze River Bridge. The completion of this project is a great victory for the Chinese people in building socialism, and also a victory for the working class of the whole world."

    狂风巨浪再也挡不住南来北往
    长江大桥上车水马龙
    国际友人来电祝贺大桥建成
    新华社武汉16日电  武汉长江大桥正式通车后的第二天，长江上遇到八级狂风，江面白浪滔滔，武汉市悬起了“风大浪急轮渡停航”的公告牌。但是，长江大桥却接待了南来北往的火车、汽车和络绎不绝的人群。
    今天的长江江面上，再也不是唐代诗人李白所说的“白浪如山那可渡，狂风愁煞峭帆人”的那番情景了。
    从15日晚六时到今晚六时，长江大桥已经通过了十一列客车、货车和专车。按照原计划，长江大桥要到10月20日以后才开始通过货运列车。但是今天，长江上的狂风巨浪吹断了连接京汉和粤汉铁路的火车轮渡的缆索，轮渡码头上马力最强的渡轮——“北京号”，也不能控制自己的航行方向，轮渡不得不在中午十二时停航了。这样，今天下午南来北往的两列货运列车就破例地提前从长江大桥驶过。这两列货车，给武汉市的一些工厂送来了北方的钢板、南方的枕木，并且把南方的大米送到了北方。
    今天，长江大桥公路桥面上，流水般地通过了各种大小车辆，许多车上载着元钢、木材、石油、粮食、糕点等货物。据有关管理人员说，武汉地区每天有好几百辆汽车过长江；每逢刮起五级风，或者下大雪大雾，轮渡就要停航，汽车不得不停在那里等着。但是今天，所有的汽车都从长江大桥上飞驰过去了。
    武汉市公共汽车公司新开辟的贯通武汉三镇的线路，从今天破晓开始，以每四分钟一班车的密度，接送上下班的工人、干部和市民。过去要坐轮渡和木船过江的武汉人，今天都从长江大桥上平安地走过。
    新华社16日讯　中国印度尼西亚友好协会在15日收到了印度尼西亚中国友好协会祝贺武汉长江大桥通车的贺电。这份贺电中说：“谨对今日长江大桥通车典礼致以祝贺，并希望中国在其他方面也获得同样成功。”
    新华社16日讯　中国人民对外文化协会在15日收到了正在广州访问的新西兰中国友好协会代表团团长梅逊祝贺长江大桥通车的贺电。他在电文中说：“新西兰中国友好协会代表团和中国人民一起，祝贺长江大桥的巨大成就。”
    新华社16日讯　中国第一机械工会全国委员会15日收到了全日本产业别工会会议全日本金属工会发来的祝贺武汉长江大桥正式通车的贺电。
    全日本金属工会的贺电说：“祝贺长江大桥的建成。这项工程的完成，是中国人民建设社会主义的伟大胜利，也是全世界工人阶级的胜利。”
