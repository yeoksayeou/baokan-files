    Joyful Youth Farm
    By our reporter Dai Yue
    From Beijing, the train travels east for about five hours to reach the Chadian Station. From the train station to the Youth Farm, there are still twenty or thirty li to go. The sun had already set, and as far as the eye could see were crops and large tracts of wasteland, the wasteland growing wild plants more than a meter tall. Just as I didn't know the way to the Youth Farm, a young female student ran over enthusiastically and asked me, "Are you going to the Youth Farm? Come with us."
    We walked for a while and heard loud singing in the distance, and small houses appeared in the vast fields, with bright lights shining from inside. I asked in surprise, "Do you live in the wasteland?" She laughed and said to me, "It's beautiful here. We are surrounded by lakes and rivers, with the Jiyun River to the east, the Jinzhong River to the south, the Xinchaobai River to the west, and the Zenggu River to the north, and in the middle are more than 300,000 mu of land, of which 140,000 mu have been cultivated. On the cultivated land are rice, millet, more than 3,000 mu of orchards, livestock farms, rice mills, tractor stations... There are rows of neat little red houses in the fields. We live in this beautiful place." After saying that, she led me to the Youth Farm's director's office. The comrades in charge there warmly received me, and the student said "Goodbye" to me and ran off. I didn't even have time to remember her name.

    Happy Labor
    At five o'clock in the morning, the students got out of bed and ran to the playground and the river to exercise, and then washed their faces and ate. When it was time to go to work at half past six, the male and female students lined up in large teams, the female students carrying hoes to hoe radishes, and the male students taking sickles to cut millet. I went to the millet field with the students from the sixth team. When we got to the field, the technician gave some instructions, and everyone worked according to the method he taught. They worked hard, one chasing after another, unwilling to fall behind. During the break, some students jokingly imitated the words of several children satirizing the farm chairman in the movie "A Beautiful Day": "Our chairman loves millet and corn, but doesn't love doing cultural activities..." Some students didn't get sickles when they went to work, so they pulled the millet by hand. When the captain walked up to these students, Wang Zengxi said: "Our captain loves radishes and potatoes, but doesn't give us sickles to cut millet." The captain laughed along with them and quickly tried to find sickles for them.
    After dinner was the happiest time for everyone. Some played ball on the playground, some sang, and those who caught crabs set up small stoves in front of the dormitory and used basins instead of pots to cook the crabs. Everyone gathered around the fire, eating and talking. The loudspeaker in the yard rang, and the announcer broadcasted their day's work achievements, and then recited a poem written by the students of the second team:
    We will use our hands to build the farm more beautifully,
    So that the power of youth shines brightly.
    We love this happy big family,
    We love this growing Youth Farm!

    Passing the First Hurdle
    On the afternoon of September 14, the Youth Farm welcomed the third batch of members. It was especially lively that day, with welcome slogans posted everywhere, and the students welcomed them with gongs and drums.
    This time, many people came from Beijing No. 10 Middle School. Ye Zili, a student who came to the Youth Farm in the second batch, was especially happy to see his new classmates. In the evening, they sat together on a large bed, and Ye Zili talked to them about how he had been tempered in labor.
    When they first came to the Youth Farm, like everyone else, they were truly happy from the bottom of their hearts when they saw so many classmates and such a beautiful environment. Everyone rushed to do the work. After two or three days, not only could no one be heard volunteering to work, but even the sound of laughter became less and less. When they returned to the dormitory in the evening, some people fell asleep without even bothering to wash their feet. The next morning, no one wanted to get up, just wanting to sleep a little longer. After getting up, their arms and legs were sore, and all their joints hurt. When they went to work, they swayed from side to side, and their hands were swollen and stiff. When they gripped the sickle, the blood blisters were squeezed and very painful. The sun was scorching like fire, and after work, everyone was dizzy... He said: "This is the first hurdle that we, the first generation of educated farmers, must pass." They overcame the difficulties in labor with a fighting spirit. Now they have all passed this hurdle, their skin is tanned black and red, their tender palms have developed calluses, and everyone eats until they are red and fat.

    Mom is Relieved
    When the farm's responsible comrades accompanied me on a tour, we entered the dormitory of the female students of the fifth team and saw a middle-aged woman sitting on the bed, mending socks. A girl next to the bed was writing a letter at the table. When she saw us, she immediately stood up and said to the farm director: "Mom is going home tomorrow, I took a day off today." The farm director nodded. I knew they were mother and daughter, so I took the opportunity to ask her mother to talk about her impressions after coming here. The girl took over first and said: "My name is Ning Chunyan, and I'm from Beijing No. 12 Middle School. After graduating from junior high school, I wanted to participate in agricultural production, so I came here. Mom found out and came to see me from Lanzhou..."
    The mother laughed when her daughter said this, and then she talked about why she came here from Lanzhou. Ning Chunyan's father works in Lanzhou. Their son and daughter stayed in Beijing to study. They never thought of having their children participate in production, but wholeheartedly wanted their children to finish middle school and go to college, so that they could become engineers and cadres in the future. They didn't expect their daughter to fail the high school entrance exam. Before Chunyan came to the farm from school, she only wrote a letter to her parents, and came without permission. The mother couldn't sleep all night after receiving her daughter's letter, fearing that her daughter couldn't stand the hardship of farming. So the couple discussed and decided that the mother would go to Beijing to take her daughter back home to study on her own, and take the school exam again next year. When she arrived in Beijing, her daughter had already left. She immediately bought a train ticket and rushed to the Chadian Youth Farm. When she saw her daughter happily returning from working in the fields, she carefully looked at her daughter's tanned red and black face, which was much healthier than before. Chunyan led her to visit the Youth Farm, and everything surprised her. Although rural life was not as comfortable as city life, and agricultural production was also very hard, it was full of youthful vitality and the joy of a new life. She also saw with her own eyes the sisterly friendship between the students, and knew that the farm had also sent female cadres to be their instructors to take care of the girls' special difficulties. After seeing these things, she dispelled the idea of asking her daughter to leave. Before leaving the farm, she also told her daughter to work hard and study hard.

    Fourteen Red Flowers
    It was noon one day, and the students who went to work had not yet returned, and the yard was quiet. I went to the dormitory of the female students of No. 9 Middle School. A girl was looking for flies with a fly swatter, and there was a pile of torn open letters on the bed, with the name Zheng Manli written on the envelopes. I thought this girl was probably Zheng Manli. I tried calling out "Zheng Manli", and she smiled and said, "I took a day off today because I wasn't feeling well."
    The thing that caught my attention most in this room was the fourteen red flowers hanging on the wall. I asked her about the origin of these flowers, and she started to talk about her situation after coming to the Youth Farm from here: "We fourteen classmates were the second batch to come, and most of us had never left home. When we came, the school gave each of us a flower. The teacher said, 'I hope you will always be as beautiful as flowers and as strong as pine and cypress.' We also knew how we should act, but we still missed home at night, and a week seemed like a month. The older students were all very nice. They cared for us like older sisters, decorated the room very beautifully, and hung all the flowers the school gave us on the wall opposite the bed, telling us that if anyone missed home, they should look at the flower and not forget what the teacher said.
    "I am sixteen years old, the youngest in this room, and they all call me 'Little Sister'. When I was at home, everything was taken care of by my mother, and sometimes my mother would wake me up to go to school early. I felt unaccustomed to everything here. Yu Xiuzhen, who sleeps next to me, is like my older sister. She is always making me laugh because she is afraid that I will miss home at night. During the day, she helps me wash clothes and mend socks when she has time after work. I am very grateful to her."
    She picked up a letter from the bed and said: "Dad also wrote to encourage me. He said that after I left, relatives and friends praised me unanimously, saying that my spirit of voluntarily participating in agricultural production was commendable. Dad said: 'Labor University' is something that everyone must attend, and we will follow behind you in the future to carry out labor training. He said this is a new road; we will always be correct in following Chairman Mao's words and taking this road. The help of my classmates and the encouragement of my father have strengthened my courage to overcome difficulties. Now I am not afraid of anything, and I have no worries. I eat my fill and go to work, and study with everyone at night." She stretched out her hand to show me, and the blood blisters that had formed during work had turned into calluses. She seemed to be using this to explain how good she was at labor.

    "I can't leave this home"
    After dinner one evening, everyone in the dormitory was holding a life meeting. I went to the twelfth group of the second team. This was a room full of male students, and they spoke very enthusiastically. Chen Chuangang, a high school graduate, said: "I have fallen in love with this place and the people here. After coming here, it really feels like being at home. The cooks in the kitchen are so good. They get up at two o'clock in the morning to cook for us. Fearing that we won't have enough to eat, they make two or three dishes. The barber's attitude is also very good. When you go to him for a haircut, he asks about your life as if you were a member of his family. The comrades in the library are very enthusiastic in finding books and newspapers for me. The captain takes even better care of us, often getting up at night to cover us with quilts. All of this has made my thoughts take root in this place. When I saw the radish field that was covered with grass a few days ago, after we weeded it, a patch of green radish seedlings emerged, and a few days later, the small radishes the size of eggs grew to the size of rice bowls. Seeing the results of my labor, I was extremely happy. Now I can't leave this home."
    The young students from Beijing are determined to settle down here.

    欢腾的青年农场
    本报记者　戴月
    从北京上火车，往东约走了五个小时，就到了茶淀车站。从火车站到青年农场，还有二三十里路。这时太阳已经下山，往远看是一眼望不到边的庄稼和大片荒地，荒地上生长着一人多高的野生植物。正当我不知道去青年农场的道路的时候，一个青年女学生热情地跑过来问我：“你是去青年农场的吗？跟我们一块走吧。”
    我们走了一会，就听到远处传来了嘹亮的歌声，在辽阔的田野上露出了一座座的小房子，里边透出了明亮的灯光。我惊奇地问：“你们住在荒地里吗？”她笑起来，并且对我说：“我们这里可美啦，周围都是湖和河，东有蓟运河，南有金钟河，西有新潮白河，北有增古河，当中有三十多万亩的土地，已经开垦的有十四万亩。在已开垦的土地上种植着稻子、谷子，还有三千多亩果树园、有畜牧场、有碾米厂、拖拉机站……田野里有一排排整齐的小红房。我们就住在这个美丽的地方。”说完了，她已经把我领到了青年农场场长办公室。那里的负责同志热情地接待我，那位学生对我说声“再见”就跑掉了，我还没来得及记下她的名字。
    愉快的劳动
    早上五点钟，学生们从床上爬起来，就跑到操场上、小河边活动，回来后洗脸、吃饭。到了六点半钟出工的时候，男女同学分别排成大队，女同学扛着锄头去锄萝卜，男同学拿着镰刀去割谷子。我跟第六队的同学一起去谷子地。到了地里，技术员比比划划地指导一阵，大家都按着他教的方法作。干起活来一个追着一个，谁也不肯落在后边。休息时，有的同学就逗趣地学着“美丽的一天”电影中几个孩子讽刺农庄主席的话：“我们主席爱谷子爱玉米，就是不爱搞文娱……”有的学生出工时没分到镰刀，就用手拔谷子，队长走到这些学生跟前时，王增玺说：“我们队长爱萝卜、爱土豆，就是不给我们镰刀割谷子。”队长听了后也跟着笑起来，赶紧想办法给他们找镰刀。
    晚饭以后是大家最快乐的时候，有的在操场上打球，有的唱歌，捉来螃蟹的人就在宿舍门前搭起小炉灶，用脸盆代替锅来煮螃蟹，大家围着火堆吃着谈着。院子里扩音器的喇叭响了，广播员播送了他们一天的劳动成绩，接着又朗诵了第二队同学们写的一首诗：
    要用双手把农场建设得更漂亮，
    使青春的力量放热发光，我们爱这快乐的大家庭，
    爱这日渐壮大的青年农场！
    过第一关
    9月14日下午，青年农场迎接第三批成员。这天特别热闹，到处张贴着欢迎的标语，同学们敲锣打鼓地欢迎他们。
    这次北京第十中学来了不少人。第二批来青年农场的学生叶自立看到了他新来的同学特别高兴，晚上他们亲亲热热地坐在一个大床上，叶自立向他们谈起他自己怎样在劳动中受到了锻炼。
    他们刚来到青年农场的时候，像所有的人一样，看到许多同学，看到这样优美的环境，真是从心里往外乐。干活大家抢着干。过了两三天以后，不但听不到有人争着干活，就连说笑的声音也越来越少了。晚上回宿舍有的人连脚也顾不上洗，就睡下了。第二天早上谁也不想起床，光想多睡一会。起来以后胳臂腿发酸，浑身上下的关节都痛，出工走路的时候东摇西晃，两只手肿的硬挺挺的，一抓紧镰刀，就把血泡挤的很痛，太阳晒得像火烤，下工以后个个昏头胀脑……他说：“这就是我们作第一代有文化的农民要过的第一关。”他们用战斗的精神克服劳动中的困难。现在他们都渡过了这一关，皮肤晒得黑红黑红的，细嫩的手掌磨出了茧子，每人都吃得又红又胖。
    妈妈放心了
    农场负责同志陪我参观时，走进了五队女同学宿舍，看到床上坐着一位中年妇女，正在补袜子，床边一个女孩正在桌子上写信，见到我们她立刻站起来对场长说：“妈妈明天要回家，今天我请假了。”场长点点头。我知道她们是母女，趁此请她母亲谈谈到这里以后的感想。女孩先接过来说：“我叫宁春燕，是北京十二中的，初三毕业以后愿意参加农业生产，就到这来了。妈妈知道了，从兰州来看我……”
    母亲听女儿说到这里笑起来了，接着她谈到为什么从兰州到这里来的。宁春燕的父亲在兰州工作。他们的一儿一女留在北京读书。从来没想过叫孩子参加生产，一心一意想叫儿女读完中学升大学，将来好当工程师、当干部。没想到女儿没考上高中。春燕从学校来农场之前，只给爸爸妈妈写了封信，没得到允许就来了。妈妈接到女儿信后一夜没睡着觉，恐怕女儿受不了干庄稼活这个苦。于是夫妇俩商量决定，母亲到北京把女儿带回去在家自学，等明年再考学校。到了北京，女儿已经走了。她马上又买了火车票赶到茶淀青年农场。当她看到女儿高高兴兴从地里干活回来的时候，她仔细地端详着女儿晒得红黑的脸，比过去健康多了。春燕领她参观青年农场，处处使她感到惊奇，虽然农村生活不及城市舒适，农业生产也很艰苦，但是这儿却充满了青春的活力和新生活的愉快，她也亲眼看到了同学之间亲如姐妹的友谊关系，知道农场为照顾女孩子的特殊困难，还派来了妇女干部作她们的辅导员。她看到这些以后，叫女儿走的念头打消了，她在离开农场之前还嘱咐女儿好好劳动，努力学习。
    十四朵红花
    这是一天中午，出工的同学还没回来，院子里静悄悄的。我到了女九中同学的宿舍。一个女孩子拿着苍蝇拍正在找苍蝇，床铺上放着一堆撕开口的信，信皮上写着郑曼丽的名字。我想这个女孩子大概就是郑曼丽。我试叫一声“郑曼丽”，她笑一笑说：“今天因为身体不舒服请假了。”
    这间屋里最使我注目的是墙上挂着的那十四朵红花。我问她这些花的来历，她就从这里开始谈起她到青年农场以后的情况：“我们十四个同学是第二批来的，大部分人没离开过家，临来时学校送给我们每人一朵花，老师说‘希望你们永远像鲜花一样美丽，永远像松柏一样坚强。’我们自己也知道应当怎样作，可是一到晚上还是想家，一个星期好像一个月。年龄大点的同学都非常好，她们像大姐姐一样地关心我们，把屋子布置得非常漂亮，把学校给我们的花都挂在床对面的墙上，叫我们谁要是想家就看看那朵花，不要忘了老师说的话。
    “我十六岁，是这屋里年龄最小的一个，她们都叫我‘小妹’，我在家时什么都靠妈妈照顾，早起上学有时还是妈妈叫。我到这里什么都感到不习惯。挨着我睡的于秀珍，她就像我的姐姐一样，晚上怕我想家老是逗我笑，白天她下工后有工夫就帮我洗衣服、补袜子，我非常感激她。”
    她顺手从床上拿起一封信说：“爸爸也来信鼓励我，他说我走后亲友们都不约而同地称赞，说我自动参加农业生产的精神是可贵的。爸爸说：‘劳动大学’是人人都要上的，我们以后还要跟在你们的后边，进行劳动锻炼。他说这是一条新的道路；我们听毛主席的话走这条道路，永远都是正确的。同学们的帮助和爸爸的鼓励，给我加强了克服困难的勇气。现在我什么也不怕，一点顾虑也没有，吃饱饭就去干活，晚上和大家一块学习。”她伸出手来给我看，干活时磨出来的血泡已经变成了茧子。她好像用这个来说明她劳动的好坏。
    “我离不开这个家了”
    一天晚饭后，宿舍里都在开生活会。我到二队十二小组去，这是一屋子男同学，他们发言非常踊跃。高中毕业生陈传广说：“我爱上了这个地方，也爱上了这里的人，到这以后真像到自己的家里一样。厨房炊事员太好了，他们早上两点多钟就起来给我们作饭，怕我们吃不饱，就作两三样菜。理发员的态度也很好，到他那儿去理发，他问长问短的好像对家里人一样。图书馆的同志，非常热情地给我找书找报纸。队长照顾我们更好，夜里常常起来给我们盖被子。这一切都使我的思想在这个地方扎了根。当我看到了前几天还被草盖着的萝卜地，经过我们锄草后露出了一片绿油油的萝卜缨子，几天后由鸡蛋那么大的小萝卜长到了饭碗那么大，看到了自己的劳动成绩，心里高兴极了。现在我离不开这个家了。”
    北京市来的青年学生们，决心在这里安家落户了。
