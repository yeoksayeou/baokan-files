    Baogang and Other Construction Units Promote Soviet Experience
    Reduce Construction Costs and Save Construction Materials
    (Xinhua News Agency dispatch) During the First Five-Year Plan period, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region promoted hundreds of Soviet advanced experiences, which played a huge role in promoting various production and construction projects.
    In winter construction, the construction departments of Baotou Iron and Steel Complex promoted the Soviet advanced experiences of the "heat storage method" and the "heating method," and the construction cost was reduced by more than 10% compared with the original "steam heating method." The promotion of Soviet advanced experiences such as "cold-drawn rebar" and "pre-stressed reinforced concrete" in Baotou and Hohhot has saved the country more than 1,000 tons of steel since last year.
    The Greater Khingan Mountains forest area, which accounts for one-fifth of China's forest area, has promoted the entire set of Soviet experience in forest management, such as forest aerial surveying and mapping methods. It can survey more than 2 million hectares of forest area a year, which is more than three times the work efficiency of using more than 200 people to survey in a year. This has played a major role in China's rapid grasp of forest area and resources. In terms of forest logging, the Soviet "main logging regulations" have been implemented, so that the stump height has been reduced from more than 20 centimeters in the past to less than 5 centimeters now. The stump height in some logging areas has been reduced to zero, saving the country a large amount of timber.
    Some departments in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have developed a good habit of paying attention to learning and promoting Soviet advanced experience. Workers on the Baogang construction site often ask Soviet experts to explain the technical knowledge and experience of the Soviet Union in industrial construction. The transportation department and some hospitals also have organizations for learning Soviet advanced experience. At the Jining Railway Station on the Friendship Road - Ji (ning) Er (lian) Railway, a full-load team for learning Soviet advanced experience was established. In the past year, this team has learned more than 70 kinds of different cargo loading methods and promoted more than 10 kinds of Soviet advanced experience in cargo loading, which solved the difficulties of few carriages and heavy transportation tasks, and also saved the country more than 4 million yuan of wealth.

    包钢等建设单位推广苏联经验
    降低施工成本节约建设材料
    本报讯　内蒙古自治区在第一个五年计划期间推广的几百项苏联先进经验，对推动各项生产建设，起了巨大作用。
    包头钢铁联合企业施工部门在冬季施工中推广苏联先进经验“蓄热法”和“暖气法”，施工成本比原来用“蒸气取暖法”降低了10％以上。包头和呼和浩特等地推行了“冷拉钢筋”、“预应力钢筋混凝土”等苏联先进经验，从去年到现在已经给国家节约了一千多吨钢材。
    占我国森林面积五分之一的大兴安岭林区，在森林经理方面推行了苏联的整套经验，如森林航测航调方法，一年可调查二百多万公顷的森林面积，比用二百多人调查一年的工作效率提高三倍多，这对我国很快掌握森林面积和资源起了很大作用。在森林采伐方面推行苏联的“主伐规程”，使伐根由过去的二十多公分降低到现在的五公分以下，有些采伐区的伐根已经降低到零，为国家节约了大批木材。
    内蒙古自治区一些部门已经养成经常注意学习和推广苏联先进经验的良好风气。在包钢工地上的职工们，常常去请苏联专家讲解苏联在工业建设上的技术知识和经验。交通运输部门和一些医院，也都设有学习苏联先进经验的组织。在友谊之路——集（宁）二（连）铁路的集宁车站，成立了学习苏联先进经验的满载小组，一年来这个小组学习了七十多种不同的货物装车法、推广了十多种货物装载的苏联先进经验，解决了车厢少、运输任务重的困难，还给国家节约了四百多万元的财富。
