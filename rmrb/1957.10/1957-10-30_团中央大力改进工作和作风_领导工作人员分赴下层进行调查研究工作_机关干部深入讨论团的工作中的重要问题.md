Xinhua News Agency, October 29th: The Central Committee of the Communist Youth League and its directly affiliated units are vigorously improving their work in the rectification movement.

    The Standing Committee and Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, based on the criticisms raised by the masses, are focusing on strengthening investigation and research, going deep into the lower levels, fully leveraging the enthusiasm of organ cadres, improving the system of collective leadership, and closely guiding the current work of the entire League to vigorously improve leadership work and leadership style. In the past four months or so, the Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League has frequently held meetings to promptly discuss and make decisions on major issues in the League's current work and in the rectification within the organs. During the most intense period of the anti-rightist struggle in the organs, the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League convened a meeting of secretaries of the League's provincial and municipal committees to discuss the political and ideological education of young people and how League organizations at all levels should carry out rectification, thereby timely guiding the work of the League nationwide. After the rectification shifted to the stage of focusing on rectification and improvement, in order to closely integrate rectification and improvement with the guidance of the League's current work, the Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League decided to combine rectification and improvement with the preparations for the upcoming Third Session of the Third Central Committee of the League. In the twenty-plus days leading up to the 29th, the Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League vigorously mobilized organ cadres to conduct in-depth discussions on rectification and improvement issues and how to hold the Third Session of the Third Central Committee of the League. This discussion has now come to an end. More than sixty people, including Hu Yaobang, Wang Wei, Liang Buting, and Xiang Nan, secretaries of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, and most members of the Standing Committee, are heading to rural areas and small and medium-sized cities in Hebei, Shaanxi, Sichuan, Jilin, Jiangxi, Anhui, and other provinces to participate in the ongoing rectification and socialist education movement, conduct investigation and research, and listen to the opinions of lower-level League organizations. In about a month, they will bring the opinions back and further discuss them among the cadres of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League. Some cadres of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League believe that the above practices are very beneficial for strengthening the relationship between superiors and subordinates, leveraging the enthusiasm of cadres, and doing a good job in rectification and improvement and guiding the current work of the League.
    The work of the League's cadres has also been strengthened. The Central Committee of the Communist Youth League has issued a decision on organizing cadres of the League to participate in physical labor in batches. The Central Committee of the Communist Youth League has already sent 183 cadres to old revolutionary base areas in northern Shaanxi and the Taihang Mountains of Shanxi Province to participate in agricultural production for a relatively long period. In order to improve the work of the League School and transform the teaching staff, the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League has decided to suspend the League School for one year, and most of the teachers of the League School have been sent to rural areas or factories to participate in physical labor.
    The organs of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League have been streamlined. In the past, the work of the Department of Youth Workers and the Department of Youth Farmers overlapped with some of the work of the General Office. Now, these two departments have been merged into the General Office and converted into two groups. The original Department of Military Sports has been merged into the Department of Propaganda, and the Personnel Department has been merged into the Organization Department. The number of cadres will also be appropriately reduced.
    In order to improve the internal democratic life of the organs, the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League has established a set of rules, which stipulate that the Standing Committee or the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League will regularly hold forums for cadres at all levels to listen to criticisms and suggestions from all parties; regularly report to all staff members on domestic and international current affairs and the work of the League; and regularize big-character posters as a venue for carrying out criticism and making suggestions.

Xinhua News Agency, October 29th: The organs and directly affiliated units of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League have held various meetings in recent days, mobilizing the masses to broadly discuss many important and urgent issues in the League's work. The main issues discussed are: how to strengthen the political and ideological education of the vast number of young people; how to rectify and strengthen the League's ranks, including grassroots organizations and cadre ranks, in conjunction with the rectification and socialist education movement; how to improve and strengthen the work of the League's newspapers and periodicals; and how to improve the leadership work of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, including streamlining institutions, strengthening collective leadership, and strengthening investigation and research.

    The rectification movement in the organs and directly affiliated units of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League officially entered the stage of focusing on rectification and improvement on October 5th. During this period, the various departments of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League held multiple meetings, and the participants fully expressed their opinions on the work of their departments and the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, and posted big-character posters, speaking out freely. Some departments also summarized and compiled the opinions raised by the masses in the previous stage of speaking out freely, and posted big-character posters for everyone to study. At the same time, the Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League held multiple enlarged meetings to carefully study the opinions of the masses, and several secretaries invited some middle and lower-level cadres to hold forums on several specific issues. The leadership also published the progress of improving work on big-character posters to encourage the masses to participate actively in rectification and improvement.
    The discussion has now come to an end. The Standing Committee and Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League have conducted serious research on the criticisms and suggestions made by the masses, and are handling them according to different circumstances.

    团中央大力改进工作和作风
    领导工作人员分赴下层进行调查研究工作
    机关干部深入讨论团的工作中的重要问题
    据新华社29日讯　共青团中央机关和直属单位在整风运动中，大力改进工作。
    团中央常务委员会和书记处根据群众提出的批评，着重从加强调查研究、深入下层、充分发挥机关干部的积极性、健全集体领导制度、抓紧指导当前全团的工作等方面，大力改进领导工作和领导作风。近四个多月来，团中央常委会经常举行会议，对当前团的工作和机关整风中的重大问题，都及时地加以讨论作出决定。在机关反右派斗争最紧张的时候，团中央召开了团的省市委书记会议，讨论了对青年的政治思想教育工作和各级团组织如何整风等问题，及时地指导了全国团的工作。在整风转入着重整改阶段以后，为了使整改和指导当前团的工作密切结合，团中央常委会决定把整改和即将召开的团的三届二中全会的准备工作结合起来。在29日以前的二十多天中，团中央常委会大力发动机关干部深入讨论整改问题和二中全会如何开法问题，现在这种讨论已经告一段落。包括团中央书记胡耀邦、王伟、梁步庭、项南和大部分常委委员在内的六十多人，正分别前往河北、陕西、四川、吉林、江西、安徽等省的农村和中小城市，参加当地正在进行的整风和社会主义教育运动，进行调查研究，听取下级团组织的意见。一个月左右以后，他们将把意见带回来，再在团中央机关干部中展开进一步的讨论。团中央机关的一些干部认为：上述做法，对于密切上下关系、发挥干部积极性，对于做好整改和指导当前团的工作很有好处。
    团的干部工作也有所加强，团中央已发出了关于分期分批组织团的干部参加体力劳动的决定。团中央机关已经派出一百八十三名干部到陕北、山西省太行山区等革命老根据地去，比较长期地参加农业生产。为了改进团校工作、改造教员队伍，团中央决定团校停办一年，团校的大部分教员已下放到农村或工厂参加体力劳动。
    团中央的机关已经作了紧缩。过去青工部、青农部的工作和办公厅有些重复，现在已把这两个部并入办公厅，改为两个组。原有的军事体育部已经并入宣传部，人事处并入了组织部。干部的人数也将适当缩减。
    团中央书记处为了健全机关内部民主生活，已定出一套制度，其中规定：团中央常委会或书记处定期召开各级干部座谈会，以听取各方面的批评和意见；定期向全体工作人员作关于国内外时事和团的工作情况的报告；把大字报经常化，作为开展批评和提出建议的园地。
    据新华社29日讯　共青团中央机关和直属单位连日来召开各种会议，发动群众，对团的工作中的许多重要问题和亟待解决的问题广泛地展开了讨论。讨论的主要问题是：如何加强对广大青年的政治思想教育工作；如何结合整风和社会主义教育运动整顿和加强团的队伍，包括基层组织和干部队伍；如何改进和加强团的报刊工作；如何改进团中央机关的领导工作，包括紧缩机构、加强集体领导、加强调查研究等问题。
    团中央机关和直属单位的整风运动是在10月5日正式转入着重整改阶段的。在这个期间，团中央各部门分别举行了多次会议，参加会议的人对本部门和团中央的工作充分地发表了自己的意见，并且张贴大字报，大鸣大放。有的部门还把前一阶段大鸣大放中群众提出的意见加以归纳整理，贴出大字报，供大家研究。同时团中央常委会举行了多次扩大会议，仔细研究群众的意见，并由几位书记分别就几个专门问题邀请部分中下级干部举行座谈会。领导上还把改进工作的情况在大字报上公布，以鼓舞群众参加整改的积极性。
    目前讨论已告一段落，团中央常委会和书记处对群众提出的批评和建议进行了认真的研究，并且正分别不同情况进行处理。
