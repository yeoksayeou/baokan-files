Xinhua News Agency, October 26th: Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Afghanistan, Sardar Mohammed Daoud, visited the Guanting Reservoir by train on the morning of the 26th. On his way back to Beijing, he visited the Great Wall and the Ming Tombs. At 7:30 in the morning, Prime Minister Daoud, accompanied by Zhang Hanying, Vice Minister of Water Resources, Wang Lin, Vice Minister of Electric Power Industry, and others, arrived at the Guanting Reservoir dam. The Prime Minister looked north towards the lake, which covers an area of 230 square kilometers. Gao Jingying, chief engineer of the former Guanting Reservoir Engineering Bureau, introduced the reservoir's significant role in flood control, water supply, irrigation, and power generation.

    Prime Minister Daoud walked across the dam and spillway, and visited the inlet, substation, turbine room, and central control room of the Guanting Hydropower Station, which has a generating capacity of 30,000 kilowatts, as well as the reservoir's intake tower. The Prime Minister raised many questions about the construction of the project and the source of the equipment. In his conversation, he repeatedly congratulated China on being able to independently design such a large-scale water conservancy project and manufacture its own machinery and equipment.

    On his way back to Beijing after visiting the Guanting Reservoir, Prime Minister Daoud ascended the Great Wall at Badaling, climbing to the wall tower at the top of the mountain. From there, he looked out over the inside and outside of the Great Wall. He also invited Bao Erhan, Ding Guoyu, and others who accompanied him on the visit to take photos with him as a souvenir. At the Ming Tombs, the Prime Minister visited the Ling'en Hall of the Changling Mausoleum, built with Phoebe nanmu wood, and the Ming Tower of the Changling Mausoleum. (Attached photo)
