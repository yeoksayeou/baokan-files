    Glorious Achievements, Great Victory
    In the past forty years, the Soviet people have achieved unprecedented and glorious achievements in peaceful construction with their working hands. This great victory on the labor front has shaken the whole world and inspired hundreds of millions of working people around the world.
    The Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Works, the Kuibyshev Hydropower Station, the "Tu-104" jet airliner, the harvest on the wasteland of Kazakhstan... These are all the pride of the Soviet people and the pride of the entire socialist camp. In the past forty years, the total industrial output of the Soviet Union has increased 45 times; the industrial development speed is 10 to 20 times faster than that of the United States, Britain, and France. Today, the Soviet Union has the largest and most mechanized collective agriculture in the world. The total agricultural product in 1956 increased by 1.7 times compared with 1913. In 1954, the Soviet people began a major advance into the wasteland, which promoted the further upsurge of agriculture.
    In the past forty years, the development of Soviet culture, education, and science has been rapid. At present, the Soviet Union is promoting a ten-year universal compulsory education on the basis of the already achieved seven-year universal compulsory education, and the number of college students is 16 times that before the October Revolution. In the years of Soviet power, 3.8 million experts have been trained, and the scientific and technological level of the Soviet Union has leapt to the forefront of the world. The Soviet little moon rotating over our heads today is proof of this.
    On the vast land of the Soviet Union, the people live the happiest lives. The young people here have great prospects, and the elderly are respected everywhere. All this happiness is due to the leadership of the Party and the glorious and hardworking Soviet working people.

    The Tuimazy-Omsk oil pipeline, which is more than 1,300 kilometers long, has been completed. This is a section extending in the Chelyabinsk Oblast.
    The Kuibyshev Hydropower Station, standing on the Volga River, was put into full production on October 14, with a power generation capacity of 2.1 million kilowatts, which is currently the largest hydropower station completed in the world.

    光辉的成就  伟大的胜利
    四十年来，苏联人民用劳动的双手在和平建设事业中取得了史无前例的光辉成就，这个劳动战线上的伟大胜利震动了整个世界，鼓舞着全世界亿万劳动人民。
    马格尼托哥尔斯克钢铁厂、古比雪夫水电站、“图——一○四”喷气式飞机、哈萨克斯坦荒地上的丰收……这些都是苏联人民的骄傲，也是整个社会主义阵营的骄傲。四十年来苏联工业总产量增加了四十五倍；工业发展速度比美、英、法三国快一、二十倍。今天，苏联拥有全世界规模最大、机械化程度最高的集体农业。农产品总量1956年比1913年增加一点七倍。1954年苏联人民开始向荒地大进军，促进了农业的进一步高涨。
    四十年来，苏联文教科学事业的发展更是一日千里。目前，苏联正在已实现的七年制普及义务教育的基础上推行十年制普及义务教育，大学生人数为十月革命前的十六倍。在苏维埃政权的年代里，培养出三百八十万名专家，苏联的科学技术水平跃居世界首位，今天在我们头上旋转的苏联小月亮就是明证。
    在苏维埃辽阔的大地上，人民过着最幸福的生活。这里的青年都有远大的前程，这里的老人到处受尊敬。这一切一切的幸福都归功于党的领导，归功于光荣辛勤的苏联劳动人民。
