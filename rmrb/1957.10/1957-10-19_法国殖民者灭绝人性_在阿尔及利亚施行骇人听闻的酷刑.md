Xinhua News Agency, Algiers, 18th: French Colonialists Inhumanely Implement Heinous Torture in Algeria
    Algiers News: The Algerian National Liberation Front's organ, "El Moudjahid," recently published an article entitled "How the French Army Implements Torture in Algeria."

    This article exposes the appalling tortures inflicted by the French colonial army on participants in the Algerian national liberation movement, including "electric shock," "water torture," "fire torture," "rope torture," and so on.

    "Electric shock" is usually carried out at night. The French army strips Algerian men and women naked, binds their hands and feet, and ties them to an "operating table." They sprinkle water all over their bodies to facilitate the flow of electricity, and then pass the current through the most sensitive parts of the victim's body. The victim's pain is indescribable. Despite being tied up, their bodies writhe in a horrifying manner under the intense shocks of electricity. To intensify the pain of electric shock, the French army also ties the victims naked to metal ladders in water basins, so that the current passes through the whole body. This is a torture specifically used on Algerian girls.

    The "water torture" inflicted by the French army involves forcibly pouring water into the victim's abdomen until it is extremely distended, and then an executioner jumps onto the victim's stomach, causing the water to gush out of the victim's mouth or anus. In the cold of late night, the French colonial army also immerses the victim completely naked in a bathtub filled with water, submerging the head to suffocate them, or hangs the victim upside down and immerses them in the sea. Then, they hoist the shivering and semi-conscious victim back up for interrogation, repeatedly applying this torture until the victim confesses, is exhausted, or dies.

    The article also narrates how the French army uses cruel "fire torture" and "rope torture" to torture nationalists.

    The French army frequently creates an atmosphere of terror among Algerian residents. Those who witness this terror often suffer from nervous disorders, miscarriages, or die from excessive heart strain. The French army often goes out to arrest people between midnight and dawn. They use gun butts to violently knock on residents' doors, even breaking down doors and windows, and commit atrocities under eerie lights, sparing neither women nor children.

    The French army has set up torture "laboratories" and concentration camps. Those fortunate enough to emerge alive from the "laboratories" are sent to concentration camps. According to official figures, there are two hundred concentration camps in Algeria. It is reported that there are currently 100,000 Algerian patriots imprisoned in concentration camps.

### 法国殖民者灭绝人性  在阿尔及利亚施行骇人听闻的酷刑

　　法国殖民者灭绝人性
    在阿尔及利亚施行骇人听闻的酷刑
    新华社18日讯  阿尔及尔消息：阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线机关刊物“圣战者报”不久以前发表一篇文章，题目是“法军怎样在阿尔及利亚实施酷刑”。
    这篇文章揭露了法国殖民军对阿尔及利亚民族解放运动参加者所施加的骇人听闻的各种酷刑，其中包括“电刑”、“水刑”、“火刑”、“绳索刑”等等。
    “电刑”通常是在夜间进行。法军把受刑的阿尔及利亚男女剥光衣服，捆绑手脚，缚在“手术台”上，全身洒水以便电力流通，然后把电流通到受刑者身体最敏感的部分。受刑者的痛苦是难以言状的。尽管被捆绑着，在电流的强烈震动下，他们的身体却令人不忍目睹地卷曲起来。为了加大电刑的痛苦，法军还把受害者裸体捆绑放在水盆里的金属梯子上，这样电流就通到全身。这是专门对阿尔及利亚少女实施的一种酷刑。
    法军所施的“水刑”是把水强行灌入受害者的腹内，直到腹部膨胀到极度，然后由一个施刑者跳到受刑者的肚子上，使水从受刑者的嘴或肛门喷泻出来。法国殖民军还在气候寒冷的深夜，把受害者全身赤裸地浸在放满水的浴缸里，把头也浸在水里让他窒息，或者把受害者头朝下吊着浸入海里，然后把冻得发抖和处于半昏迷状态的受刑者重新吊上来审讯，这样反复施刑直到受刑者招供、精疲力竭或者死去。
    文章还叙述了法军如何使用残酷的“火刑”和“绳索刑”来拷打民族主义者。
    法军在阿尔及利亚居民中经常制造恐怖气氛。目睹这种恐怖的人常常得了神经病、流产或者因心脏过度紧张而死。法军常在午夜到清晨的时间里四出捕人。他们用枪柄到处猛敲居民大门，甚至打破门窗，在阴森的灯光下横施暴行，妇女和小孩也不能幸免。
    法军设置了酷刑“实验室”和集中营。幸而能活着走出“实验室”的人，就被送进集中营去。据官方数字，阿尔及利亚境内有二百个集中营。有消息说：目前被关在集中营里的阿尔及利亚爱国者有十万人。
