Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 6th: News of the Soviet Union's launch of an artificial satellite has caused "great surprise" and "anxiety" among the ruling circles in the United States.

Agence France-Presse reported that Washington sources believe that the Soviet Union will enjoy prestige worldwide for a long time due to this victory. The United States has lost the satellite race, which was considered a marvel.

After a period of silence, White House Press Secretary Hagerty read a statement to reporters on the 5th, acknowledging that the Soviet Union's launch of the first artificial satellite was "of great scientific significance." However, he feigned composure and said that this event "does not surprise the present (American) government."

McElroy, who will succeed Wilson as Secretary of Defense on October 9, said that the Soviet Union's launch of an artificial satellite "proves once again that Russia must be respected."

Senator Jackson said that the Soviet Union's launch of the world's first artificial satellite was "a devastating blow to the scientific, industrial, and technological reputation of the United States."

The US Department of Defense announced on the same day that the third rocket launch test in the American artificial Earth satellite program will be conducted within a few days. Only the rocket will be tested, without a satellite. At the same time, American scientists and engineers participating in the program said that the rockets being tested in the United States cannot launch a satellite as large as the Soviet satellite out of the Earth's atmosphere. The satellite that the United States intends to launch next year weighs only about twenty-one and a half pounds, while the Soviet Union's launch weighed more than one hundred and eighty pounds.

    美国官方惊慌失措
    承认在卫星竞赛中输了
    据新华社6日讯　华盛顿消息：苏联发射人造卫星的消息在美国的统治集团中引起的反应是“非常吃惊”和“焦虑”。
    法新社消息说，华盛顿人士认为，苏联由于这种胜利而将长期在全世界享有威信。美国已在奇闻的卫星竞赛中输了。
    美国官方在经历一阵沉默以后，白宫新闻发布官哈格蒂5日对新闻记者宣读一项声明，承认苏联发射第一个人造卫星“具有巨大的科学意义”。但是，他又故作镇静地说，这件事“并不使本（美国）政府感到意外”。
    将在10月9日继威尔逊出任国防部长的麦克艾罗伊说，苏联发射人造卫星这件事“再一次证明必须尊重俄国”。
    参议员杰克逊说，苏联发射世界上第一颗人造卫星“是对美国的科学、工业和技术的名声的一个毁灭性打击”。
    美国国防部同一天宣布，美国人造地球卫星计划中的第三次火箭发射试验将在几天之内进行。试验的只是火箭，并不带有卫星。同时，参加这个计划工作的美国科学家和工程师说，美国试验中的火箭不能把像苏联卫星那么大的卫星推出地球的气层。美国打算在明年发射的卫星重量只约有二十一磅半，而苏联这次发射的重一百八十多磅。
