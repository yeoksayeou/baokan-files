Guangxi Province's Education Department, in the spirit of rectifying while improving, has actively adopted measures to improve the quality of secondary school education in minority areas.

The main problems with secondary education in minority areas in Guangxi in the past were generalized teaching materials, overly complex content, and excessive workload, making them unsuitable for teaching purposes. In order to overcome these shortcomings, the Provincial Education Department, based on the characteristics of minority areas, has appropriately revised the annual teaching plan for this academic year and appropriately adjusted the number of class hours. In addition, the Provincial Education Department has also established six junior high school preparatory classes in counties directly under the jurisdiction of the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Prefecture, and in the Yishan, Baise, and PingLe special districts, to absorb primary school students from ethnic groups other than Zhuang and Han, such as Miao, Yao, and Dong, to ensure that these ethnic groups have a certain number and quality of primary school students entering junior high school.

　　广西改进少数民族地区中等教育工作
    广西省教育厅本着边整边改精神，积极采取措施，提高少数民族地区中等学校教育质量。
    广西少数民族地区中等教育，过去存在的主要问题是教材一般化，内容过杂，分量过重，不适合教学之用。为着克服这些缺点，省教育厅根据少数民族地区特点，适当地修改了本学年年度教学计划，并适当地调整了授课时数。此外，省教育厅还在桂西僮族自治州直属县、宜山、百色、平乐等专区，设立六个初中预备班，吸收僮、汉族以外的苗、瑶、侗等族小学生学习，保证这些民族有一定数量和质量的小学生升入初中。　（据新华社讯）
