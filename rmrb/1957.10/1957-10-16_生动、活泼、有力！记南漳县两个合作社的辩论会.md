Lively, Active, and Powerful!
A Record of a Debate Between Two Cooperatives in Nanzhang County
    In the socialist education movement in Nanzhang County, Hubei Province, the majority of the masses are trusted, and the masses are mobilized to start debates. Currently, many places have seen mass debates of mutual assistance between fathers and sons, husbands and wives, relatives and friends, and neighbors. These debates are so lively, active, and powerful!

    Family Debate

    In the Peace Tenth Cooperative.

    People had debated with wealthy middle peasant Yang Junzhang several times at group meetings, but he still insisted on these arguments: "The state monopoly of purchase and marketing enriches the country and impoverishes the people; it takes grain from the peasants and then exploits them through state marketing." "There's work to do, but no money to spend; the cooperative is a swindle." "The world is not bright now."

    Each time Yang Junzhang returned home from a group debate, he thought to himself with satisfaction: "Humph, no matter what you say, I'm sticking to this."

    However, one day, Yang Junzhang's triumphant mood disappeared when he returned home. This unhappiness came from his own family.

    It turned out that after his wife and son had attended several debates, they had distinguished right from wrong. The mother and son discussed a way to debate with Yang Junzhang—if they couldn't convince him by reasoning, they would "expose his past."

    The debate began. The wife said:

    "You say the world is not bright now; you're just being deliberately unreasonable. In the years I came to your house, you didn't dare sleep at home at night, and you didn't dare work in the fields during the day. You were always afraid of being conscripted, and sure enough, in the year before liberation, they still dragged you away and held you in the township office. I sold twelve 'shi' of grain and a piglet to redeem you, and that's how I bought back your life. Now, who dares to provoke you?"

    "There's no arguing with that," Yang Junzhang nodded, and continued: "But, after joining the cooperative, there's no money to spend, things are too tight, and it's not convenient to get a little oil and salt. Isn't that true?"

    "You're lying through your teeth," the wife glared at her husband, and said: "Just take last year, you sewed seven pieces of clothing, both long and short, all from fine cloth. When did that ever happen in the past? There's still thirty yuan in the house, and you even lent ten yuan to someone. How can you say there's no money to spend?"

    Yang Junzhang reached out and scratched the back of his head, not making a sound. After a long while, he slowly said:

    "No matter how well you say it, I still feel that giving grain to the state is not as good as keeping it at home."

    At this time, the son, Yang Jianguo, sitting beside his mother, spoke:

    "Keeping grain at home is better than giving it to the state. Doesn't that mean you still want to engage in exploitation and take the capitalist road of one person getting rich while everyone else stays poor?"

    "Who wants to engage in exploitation?" Yang Junzhang stood up abruptly, speaking in a coarse voice. The son, on the other hand, calmed down and said slowly and gently:

    "You lent one 'shi' and two 'dou' of corn to Yin Qingfan and Du XingLe in the spring, with a 'big three' interest (three 'sheng' added to one 'dou'), doing it secretly. Do you think I don't know! You know, hoarding grain without selling it and lending it out at high interest is exploitation; it's taking the capitalist road." The son secretly looked at his father, who had his head lowered. The son continued: "The state sells grain at the same price in spring and winter, without making money from the peasants. How can that be considered exploiting the peasants?"

    Yang Junzhang was silent, staring at the roof beams with both eyes. After a long time, he mumbled:

    "I'm getting senile."

    The next day, Yang Junzhang withdrew his past erroneous arguments against the state monopoly of purchase and marketing and against the cooperative.

    Exposing the Inside Story

    The group debate of the eighth production team of the first cooperative in Miaopu Township began, the object of the debate being Wu Yuanzhen.

    Wu Yuanzhen was a wealthy middle peasant who used to own thirty-four mu of land and had three laborers. During the high tide of cooperativization in 1955, he joined the advanced cooperative "following the crowd". After joining the cooperative, he often complained and made strange remarks. He only allowed two of the three laborers to participate in the cooperative's production, while he himself stayed at home to manage his private plot and sometimes engaged in speculative business. This behavior of his had been criticized by the cooperative. During this period of "blooming and contending," he felt that the opportunity to "pour out grievances" had come, so he rallied five middle-peasant households to oppose the state monopoly of purchase and marketing and to oppose the cooperative. He first expressed his opinion, saying: "The state monopoly of purchase and marketing is killing people: In 1953, the state monopoly starved one of my young children to death, and another is so starved that he can't walk now. My wife was so starved that she divorced me, and my son (the son-in-law I adopted) was also forced to enlist in the army because of starvation and separated from me. In the cooperative, you only work but don't get any money. It's not as good as being a long-term worker in the past…" Now, everyone is debating with him about these remarks, explaining from their own personal experiences that the state monopoly of purchase and marketing and the cooperative have ten benefits. But Wu Yuanzhen doesn't like to listen, shaking his head and saying:

    "No matter how many thousands or tens of thousands of mouths you have, speaking from this year to next year, I won't be convinced of the things I've said."

    The first group debate passed like this. In the second group debate, Wu Yuanzhen still refused to be convinced. The third time… everyone was a little anxious.

    Wu Yuanzhen's married daughter, Wu Jinxiu, his divorced wife, Gong Deying, and some neighbors had long improved their awareness and distinguished right from wrong in the socialist education movement. Now that they heard that everyone could not refute Wu Yuanzhen's remarks, they all volunteered to participate in the production team's group meeting to debate with Wu Yuanzhen. They didn't say anything else; first, they clarified the facts about Wu Yuanzhen's statement that "the state monopoly of purchase and marketing is killing people."

    "The state monopoly of purchase and marketing, is it killing people? You can't say that," Wu Jinxiu said softly: "The son is the adopted son-in-law. You disliked him and drove us out the door. How can you say that the state monopoly of purchase and marketing forced the separation? He went to the army at the eligible age; enlisting is the duty of young people. How can you say that he was forced to run away because of starvation due to the state monopoly of purchase and marketing?"

    As soon as she finished speaking, Gong Deying continued:

    "The young child died of illness in 1952, when there was no state monopoly of purchase and marketing yet. How can you say that the state monopoly starved him to death? The five-year-old child couldn't walk because he was born disabled; it wasn't because he was starved by the state monopoly of purchase and marketing. You wanted a divorce because you disliked me. How can you put that on the state monopoly of purchase and marketing?"

    Wu Yuanzhen's face was long, and he raised his head sharply. A neighbor then spoke:

    "I live next door to you. You said the state monopoly of purchase and marketing was bad, and you also said that the grain left for you in 1953 was not enough. That's not true. At that time, you deliberately cooked vegetables during the day and ate them in front of people, but secretly ate rice at night."

    Wu Yuanzhen blinked his eyes and couldn't speak. Obviously, exposing his inside story had taken effect, so everyone continued to present some facts:

    "You said that you only work in the cooperative and don't get any money; it's not as good as being a long-term worker. Let's just calculate your income account: In 1952, you planted seventeen mu of land and earned three hundred and forty yuan. After deducting forty-five yuan for public grain and seeds, your family's net income was two hundred and ninety-five yuan. In the first year of joining the cooperative (1956), your family's net income was three hundred and sixty yuan. Your income not only did not decrease but also increased by sixty-five yuan. Is the cooperative treating you badly?"

    Wu Yuanzhen could not answer and angrily turned the conversation to another aspect:

    "In 1953, when you monopolized the purchase, you searched my warehouse, locked me up, and took off my clothes..."

    "That's not true," production team leader Wang Naisheng said. "At that time, it was because you resisted the state monopoly of purchase and marketing and transferred the grain that we held a mobilization meeting at your house all night. Who locked you up? You took off your clothes yourself to be unreasonable. You also said at the time: 'If you don't believe me, I'll freeze to death tonight!' As for the cadres' bad attitude, we will examine ourselves. But is it right for you not to sell grain?"

    Wu Yuanzhen's face flushed red, and his head drooped…

    At the next group meeting, Wu Yuanzhen did not debate with everyone. He said that he accepted everyone's opinions, admitted his mistakes, and explained: "Why do I have resistance to the state monopoly of purchase and marketing and the cooperative? It's because I'm dissatisfied with not being able to hire long-term workers, dissatisfied with not being able to lend money at high interest rates, and dissatisfied with not being able to hoard grain and buy low and sell high. It's all because of capitalist ideas. From now on, I must resolutely turn back. Work hard together with everyone and take the socialist road."

### 生动、活泼、有力！记南漳县两个合作社的辩论会

　　生动、活泼、有力！
　　记南漳县两个合作社的辩论会
    湖北省南漳县在进行社会主义教育运动中，相信群众的多数，放手发动群众展开辩论。目前许多地方出现了父子、夫妇、亲友、邻居之间的互相帮助的群众性的辩论。这些辩论是这样的生动、活泼、有力！
    家庭辩论
    在和平第十社。
    小组会上，人们和富裕中农杨俊章辩论好几次了，但是他还是坚持这些论调：“统购统销是富国穷民；从农民手里夺去粮食，又来统销剥削农民。”“有活干，没钱用，合作社是坑人店。”“现在世道不光明。”
    每次，杨俊章参加罢小组辩论会回家，总是这样得意地想：“哼，不管你们说什么，反正我就是这一套。”
    可是，有一天，杨俊章回到家里，这种得意的心情消失了。这个不愉快来自自己的家里。
    原来他的妻子和儿子参加过几次辩论会之后，明辨了大是大非，母子两人商量了一个和杨俊章辩论的办法——如果说不过他就“揭底”。
    辩论开始了。妻子说：
    “你说现在世道不光明，才是有意跟人家‘蛮盘理’（胡闹）。我来你家的那几年，你晚上不敢睡在家里，白天不敢在地里做活，早的晚的怕拉兵，怕着怕着，在解放前一年仍然将你拉走了，押在乡公所里。我卖了十二石粮食、一个猪娃将你赎回来，才买来你这条命。现在，谁个再敢惹你？”
    “这话没说的。”杨俊章点了点头，接着说：“可是，入社以后，没钱用，捆的紧，吃点油盐就不方便，这不是真的吗？”
    “你这是睁开眼睛说瞎话。”妻子瞪了丈夫一眼，说：“单说你去年一个人就缝长短七件衣服，尽是细布的，过去那有这回事？现在家里还放着三十元钱，你还借给人家十元，这怎么说没钱用呢？”
    杨俊章伸手搔着后脑勺，不作声，半晌，徐徐地说：
    “你们说的再好，我总觉得把粮食统给国家，就不如在家里放着好。”
    这时候，坐在母亲旁边的儿子杨建国说话了：
    “把粮食统给国家，不如放在家里，你的意思不是还想搞剥削、走一人富万人穷的资本主义道路吗？”
    “谁个想搞剥削？”杨俊章霍地立起来，粗声说。儿子倒沉住气，慢慢地柔和地说：
    “春上放了一石二斗苞谷给殷清凡、杜兴乐，‘大加三’的利（一斗加三升），黑里来黑里走，你当我不知道！你知道吗？囤粮不卖，放高利贷，这就是剥削，就是走资本主义道路。”儿子偷偷地望着父亲，父亲低垂着脑袋。儿子继续说：“国家卖粮食，春冬价钱一样，不赚农民的钱，怎么算是剥削农民呢？”
    杨俊章默默无言，睁着两只眼睛望屋梁，半晌，嗫嚅地说：
    “我老糊涂了。”
    第二天，杨俊章把过去反对统购统销、反对合作社的错误论调收回去了。
    揭穿内幕
    苗圃乡第一社第八生产队的小组辩论会开起来了，辩论的对象是吴元真。
    吴元真是富裕中农，过去有三十四亩地，三个劳动力，1955年合作化高潮中，他“随大流”加入了高级社。入社以后，他经常发牢骚，说怪话，三个劳动力只让两个参加社里的生产，他自己留在家里经营自留地，有时做些投机生意。他的这种行为曾经受过社里的批评。这次大鸣大放当中，他认为“吐苦水”的机会来了，就拉拢了五户中农起来反对统购统销，反对合作社。他首先发表意见说：“统购统销害死人：1953年统购把我的小娃子饿死一个，另一个饿的现在不会走路，老婆饿的和我离了婚，儿子（招的女婿）也因为挨饿逼的去当兵，并和我分了家。在合作社光干活，没钱用，还不如过去一个长工。……”现在大家针对他的这些言论和他辩论——从自己的切身体会说明统购统销和合作社有十条好处。但是，吴元真不爱听，脑袋一摆，说：
    “我说的几条，任你们千张嘴万张嘴，今年说到明年，我也服不了。”
    第一次小组辩论会就这样过去了。第二次小组辩论会吴元真仍然表示不服，第三次………大家有点焦急了。
    吴元真的出嫁了的女儿吴金秀，离了婚的妻子龚德英，以及一些邻居，在社会主义教育运动中，早就提高了觉悟，分清了是非。现在他们听说大家驳不倒吴元真的言论，都自告奋勇地参加生产队的小组会同吴元真辩论。他们不说别的，首先就吴元真说的“统购统销害死人”这一条把事实弄清楚。
    “统购统销是不是害死人？不能这样说。”吴金秀轻轻地说：“儿子是招的女婿，你嫌他不好，把我们赶出门来，怎么能说统购统销逼的分家呢？他是适龄应征去的，当兵也是青年人应尽的义务，怎么能说因为统购统销挨饿逼跑了呢？”
    话音一落，龚德英接着说：
    “小娃子是1952年病死的，那时还没有统购统销，那能说统购统销把人饿死？那个五岁的小娃不会走路，是生下来就残废的，也不是统购统销饿坏的。你要离婚，是你嫌我不好，怎能安到统购统销上头？”
    吴元真脸孔拉得长长的，猛抬头，一个邻居又说话了：
    “我和你住隔壁。你说统购统销不好，还说1953年给你留的粮食不够。这不是事实。那时你白天故意煮青菜端到人们面前吃，晚上却偷偷地吃起大米干饭了。”
    吴元真?了?眼睛，说不出话来。显然，揭穿他的内幕发生了效力，于是大家继续摆出了一些事实：
    “你说合作社光干活，没钱用，不如当长工。就算一算你的收入账吧：1952年你种十七亩地，收入三百四十元，除去公粮种子四十五元，全家纯收入二百九十五元。入社的第一年（1956年），全家纯收入三百六十元。收入不仅没有减少，还增加六十五元。合作社是不是对你不好？”
    吴元真无法回答，气呼呼地把话转到另一方面来了：
    “1953年统购，你们查了我的仓，关了我，脱了我的衣服……”
    “这不是事实。”生产队长王奈生说，“那时因为你抵抗统购统销，转走了粮食，在你家开了一夜动员会，谁关了你？衣服是你自己脱光耍赖。你那时还说：“不相信我，今夜冻死算了！”至于干部的态度不好，我们检讨。可是，你不卖粮就对吗？”
    吴元真涨红了脸，脑袋垂下来了……
    在下一次小组会上，吴元真不和大家辩论了。他说他接受大家的意见，承认自己的错误，并且说明：“我为什么对统购统销和合作社有抵触？就因为不能请长工不满，不能放高利贷不满，不能囤积粮食、贱买贵卖不满。这都是资本主义思想作怪，今后要坚决回过头来。和大家一起积极劳动，走社会主义道路。”本报记者　古维进
