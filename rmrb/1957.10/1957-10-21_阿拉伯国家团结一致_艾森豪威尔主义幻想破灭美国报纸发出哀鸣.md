    Arab Countries Unite
    Eisenhower Doctrine's Illusions Shattered, American Newspapers Lament
    Xinhua News Agency, New York, 20th - According to TASS, some American newspapers point out that the aggressive "Eisenhower Doctrine" has angered Arab countries.

    "New York Times" Washington correspondent Schmidt said that when the United States implied it would use this doctrine against Syria, other Arab countries united to defend Syria, and this "doctrine" turned against the United States. He went on to cite the fact that the Lebanese government is facing increasing public demands to reject the "Eisenhower Doctrine." The Iraqi government is trying to avoid mentioning its connection with the doctrine. Saudi Arabian King Saud has also issued a statement denying that he ever supported the doctrine, and the Jordanian government is severing ties with it.

    The "Christian Science Monitor's" Washington correspondent pointed out that if some Arab countries' rulers previously held some illusions about the "Eisenhower Doctrine," then now, under the impact of facts, these illusions have dissipated. He said: "Washington's attempt to get Arabs to fight Arabs, that is, to instigate Jordan against Syria and Saudi Arabia against Egypt, was too obvious. This overly blatant approach has had an impact on Arab countries."

    The "New York Post" blamed American officials for "clumsily allowing the Syrian government to seize evidence proving that the United States is colluding with Syrian reactionary conspirators who now live in Turkey."

    阿拉伯国家团结一致
    艾森豪威尔主义幻想破灭美国报纸发出哀鸣
    新华社20日讯  据塔斯社纽约19日讯：美国有些报刊指出，侵略性的“艾森豪威尔主义”激怒了阿拉伯国家。
    “纽约时报”的华盛顿记者施密特说，当美国暗示它将利用这一主义来反对叙利亚的时候，其他阿拉伯国家却团结在一起来保卫叙利亚，于是这一“主义”反过来对美国不利了。他接着举例说，黎巴嫩政府面临的事实是人民加紧要求拒绝“艾森豪威尔主义”。伊拉克政府尽量避免提起自己跟这个主义有联系。沙特阿拉伯国王沙特也发表声明，否认他曾经支持过这个主义，而约旦政府正在断绝同这个主义的关系。
      “基督教科学箴言报”华盛顿记者指出，如果说过去某些阿拉伯国家的当权者对“艾森豪威尔主义”还存有某些幻想的话，那么现在，在事实的打击下，这些幻想已经消散了。他说：“华盛顿过于明显地企图让阿拉伯人打阿拉伯人，即唆使约旦反对叙利亚、唆使沙特阿拉伯反对埃及。这种过于露骨的做法对阿拉伯国家产生了影响。”
    “纽约邮报”责备美国官方人士“笨拙地让叙利亚政府抓住了证据，证明美国同现在住在土耳其的叙利亚反动阴谋家串通一气。”
