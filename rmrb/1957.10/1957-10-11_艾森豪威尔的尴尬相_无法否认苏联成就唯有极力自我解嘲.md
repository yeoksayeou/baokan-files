Xinhua News Agency, 10th dispatch from Washington: U.S. President Eisenhower held a press conference on the 9th and issued a statement on the Soviet Union's successful launch of an artificial satellite.

Eisenhower acknowledged that the Soviet Union's launch of an artificial satellite into outer space was a significant achievement. He said, "Regarding the Soviet satellite, we congratulate the Soviet scientists on its successful launch." "Because at least Russian scientists have proven the first part of it, that is to say, this kind of thing can be successfully put into orbit."

Eisenhower said that in a political sense, the launch of the artificial satellite may give the Soviets a "great psychological advantage" around the world. In a scientific sense, it proves one thing, that is, the Soviet Union has the thrusters and launchers to put the satellite into space.

At the press conference, Eisenhower also tried his best to belittle the significance of this great scientific achievement of the Soviet Union, and made self-deprecating remarks about the United States lagging behind the Soviet Union in launching artificial satellites. He said that the United States "never regarded the artificial satellite program as a competition with other countries. Its progress was only carefully determined as part of the scientific work of the International Geophysical Year." According to him, the reason why the United States could not launch an artificial satellite earlier seemed to be only because the U.S. government did not pay attention to the satellite program and did not give this program the same priority as the missile research work. However, under questioning from reporters, Eisenhower had to admit that the U.S. government attached importance to the artificial satellite program, and the United States indeed "spent a lot of money, a lot of time, and a lot of energy" in this regard. But according to the American plan, the "fully equipped" satellite of the United States will not be launched until March next year, and the satellite "for testing purposes" will not be launched until December this year, and the American satellite is not as heavy as the Soviet one. He said that the Soviet artificial satellite weighing one hundred and eighty pounds has made American scientists feel "surprised."

Talking about the missile issue, Eisenhower said that he did not know any details of the Soviet Union's intercontinental missile test, but he believed that the thing launched by the Soviet Union traveled a "very long distance." He said that if the Soviet intercontinental missile "is accurately launched and its warhead is launched at the predetermined location," then this is a "very huge achievement."

When asked whether the United States is prepared to reach an agreement with the Soviet Union on supervising space missiles, Eisenhower repeated the State Department's statement that the disarmament proposals previously put forward by the West advocated a multilateral international study, rather than a bilateral study between the United States and the Soviet Union. He said that the United States is not prepared to consider changing this aspect of the proposal.

### 艾森豪威尔的尴尬相  无法否认苏联成就唯有极力自我解嘲

　　艾森豪威尔的尴尬相
    无法否认苏联成就唯有极力自我解嘲
    据新华社10日讯　华盛顿消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔9日举行记者招待会，并且就苏联成功地发射人造卫星一事发表声明。
    艾森豪威尔承认，苏联把人造卫星发射到外空去是一个重大的成就。他说，“关于苏联人造卫星，我们为它的发射成功向苏联科学家们祝贺”。“因为至少俄国科学家已经证明了它的第一部分，那就是说，这种东西是能够很成功地进行公转的”。
    艾森豪威尔说，在政治意义上说，发射人造卫星可能使苏联人在世界各地占了“很大的心理上的便宜”，在科学意义上说，这证明一件事，那就是苏联有使人造卫星升空的推进器和发射器。
    艾森豪威尔在记者招待会上同时又竭力企图贬低苏联这一伟大科学成就的意义，并且为美国在发射人造卫星方面落后于苏联一事作自我解嘲。他说，美国“从来都没有把人造卫星计划当作和别的国家进行的竞赛来进行，它的进度只是作为国际地球物理年的科学工作的一部分而谨慎确定”。按照他的说法，美国所以不能早日发射人造卫星，似乎只是由于美国政府没有重视卫星计划，没有给予这个计划以同研究导弹工作一样的优先性。但是在记者的追问下，艾森豪威尔不得不承认，美国政府对于人造卫星计划是重视的，美国在这方面的确“花了大批钱，大量的时间和大量的精力”。但是按照美国的计划，美国“装备齐全”的卫星要到明年3月才能发射出来，“供试验用”的卫星也要在今年12月间才能发射，而且美国的卫星还没有苏联的那样重。他说，苏联的人造卫星重一百八十磅已经使美国的科学家们感到“惊讶”。
    谈到导弹问题，艾森豪威尔说，他并不知道苏联试验洲际导弹的任何细节，但是他认为，苏联发射的东西是经过“非常远的距离”的。他说，如果苏联的洲际导弹“被准确地发射以及在预定的地方发出它的弹头的话”，那么这就是一种“非常巨大的成就”。
    谈到美国是否准备同苏联达成关于监督空间导弹的协议的问题时，艾森豪威尔重复国务院的说法，就是西方曾经提出的裁军建议主张进行一种多边的国际研究，而不是美苏两国的双边研究。他说，美国对建议的这一方面不准备考虑改变。
