In addition to requesting the Indian government to take necessary initiatives to further strengthen the unity of Asian and African countries, the resolution also called on people from all walks of life in India to stand up and speak out for the cause of Syrian independence.

    据新华社新德里19日电  据最近一期的“新世纪”周刊报道，印度共产党中央委员会通过决议，保证支持叙利亚反对西方国家的侵略政策的斗争。
    决议说，美国为了镇压复苏的阿拉伯民族主义，已经破坏了黎巴嫩和约旦的自由，而土耳其现在正在接受装备和受到煽动，要它侵略叙利亚，以便为美国的武装干涉制造借口。决议除了要求印度政府采取必要的主动来进一步加强亚非国家的团结以外，还呼吁印度一切阶层的人民起来为叙利亚的独立事业大声疾呼。
