Zhang Fang, Member of the CPPCC National Committee, Engages in Sabotage Activities Under the Guise of Inspection Tours

At a recent enlarged meeting of the Study Committee of the Henan Provincial Committee of the CPPCC, the reactionary words and deeds of Zhang Fang, a rightist element and member of the CPPCC National Committee, were exposed.

Zhang Fang spread rumors, saying: "Now there are no funds for socialist construction, and it will soon grind to a halt. All policies have been messed up. All enterprises are losing money." Zhang Fang slandered the agricultural collectivization policy as "exploiting the peasants" and "treating the peasants as slaves."

Zhang Fang also frequently used inspection tours as opportunities to carry out reactionary and evil activities. In April of this year, when Zhang Fang went to his hometown for an inspection, he specifically sought out landlords, local bullies, and individuals under surveillance for conversations. When the big landlord Lei Daojiu spoke with Zhang Fang, he viciously cursed the government, saying that people were being forced into unbearable situations. Zhang Fang actually replied, "There may be a reckoning in the future." After Zhang Fang left, the reactionary arrogance of those landlords and rich peasants became rampant. When Zhang Fang inspected Zhengzhou University, he openly said to the school leaders, "There should be no political education in universities. University students should focus on studying and not meddle in politics." When Zhang Fang inspected a primary school in Mengjin County, he even gave a speech to the primary school students, telling them to "study hard and become officials in the future." When the primary school students said, "We also have to work," Zhang Fang shamelessly said, "It's still better to be an official."

Fan Longzhang, a counselor in the Henan Provincial People's Committee Counselor's Office, revealed that in 1951, Zhang Fang had cursed Marxism-Leninism as a "raging flood" in front of him in Xi'an.

Zhang Fang had served as the Commander-in-Chief of the 20th Route Army of the Kuomintang, acting governor of the puppet Henan Province, director of the Department of Civil Affairs, director of the Department of Construction, and "Suppression Commissioner," among other reactionary positions. In the past, he had connections with bandits in the Henan and Shaanxi areas and called himself the "Big Boss." Zhang Fang also personally led troops to attack the old revolutionary base area in the Dabie Mountains. During his time as the puppet "Suppression Commissioner," he persecuted many progressive people and innocent civilians. (Xinhua News Agency dispatch)

    政协全国委员会委员张钫利用视察工作机会进行破坏活动
    在政协河南省委员会学习委员会最近举行的扩大会议上，揭露了政协全国委员会委员，右派分子张钫的反动言行。
    张钫造谣说：“现在社会主义建设没有资金了，快停摆了。一切的政策都搞糟了。一切的企业都赔钱了。”张钫污蔑农业合作化政策是“剥削农民”，“把农民当奴隶”。
    张钫还经常借视察工作的机会进行反动的罪恶活动。今年4月间，张钫到他的家乡视察时，专门找一些地主恶霸和被管制分子谈话。大地主雷道九同张钫谈话时，恶毒地咒骂政府，说把人逼得不能过”，张钫竟回答说：“将来也有清算的可能。”张钫走后，那些地主、富农分子的反动气焰就嚣张起来。张钫视察郑州大学时，公然对学校负责人说：“大学里不应该有政治教育，大学生最好是读书，不要过问政治。”张钫在孟津县视察小学时，还给小学生讲话，要他们“好好读书，将来当官。”小学生们说：“我们还要劳动呢”，张钫却恬不知耻地说：“还是当官好。”
    河南省人民委员会参事室参事范龙章揭露说，1951年张钫在西安曾经在他面前咒骂马克思列宁主义是“洪水猛兽”。
    张钫曾担任过国民党第二十路军总指挥、伪河南省代理省主席、民政厅长、建设厅长、“清乡督办”等反动职务。过去和河南、陕西一带的股匪都有联系，自称是“老大王”。张钫还亲自带兵进攻过大别山革命老根据地。他担任伪“清乡督办”时，残害过不少进步人士和无辜老百姓。　（新华社专稿）
