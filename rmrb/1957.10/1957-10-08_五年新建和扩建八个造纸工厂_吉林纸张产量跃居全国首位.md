Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 7th. Jilin Province's paper industry, having completed the First Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, now has the highest paper production in the country.

During the First Five-Year Plan, Jilin Province built one new paper mill and expanded seven paper mills. Now, Jilin's paper industry has not only seen a leap in production but also an increase of thirty-three product varieties, including rayon wood pulp, various industrial specialty paperboards, and high-grade paper such as typing paper and offset printing paper. At the same time, due to the gradual reduction of costs and the year-by-year increase in profits, the fixed assets of the entire province's paper industry were fully recovered in the first three years of the First Five-Year Plan.

In order to increase production, all employees of Jilin Province's paper mills vigorously tapped the potential of equipment during the Five-Year Plan period. For example, the state-owned Jilin Paper Mill, by improving management, increasing equipment utilization, and raising the paper's finished product rate, produced 57,000 tons of paper in 1953, and increased production to 75,000 tons in 1957 with the same production equipment. In order to reduce costs, the three major state-owned paper mills, in conjunction with scientific research institutions, made extensive use of slabs and low-grade timber to replace expensive logs in the manufacture of high-grade printing paper. The state-owned Jilin Paper Mill alone saved the state more than 400,000 cubic meters of logs in five years by using slabs instead of logs for industrial paper.

    五年新建和扩建八个造纸工厂
    吉林纸张产量跃居全国首位
    新华社长春7日电　提前完成了第一个五年计划的吉林省造纸工业，现在的造纸产量已经占全国第一位。
    在第一个五年计划期间，吉林省新建了一个造纸厂，扩建了七个造纸厂。现在吉林造纸工业不仅产量有了飞跃提高，而且产品品种也增加了三十三种；其中有人造丝木浆，各种工业用的特殊纸板，以及打字纸、胶板印刷纸等高级纸。同时，由于成本逐年降低，利润逐年增加，全省造纸工业的固定资产，在第一个五年计划的前三年就全部收回了。
    吉林省各造纸工厂的全体职工为了增加生产，在五年计划期间大力发挥了设备潜力。如国营吉林造纸厂由于改善管理，提高设备利用率和纸的成品率，用同样的生产设备，1953年产纸五万七千吨，1957年就增产到七万五千吨。为了降低成本，三大国营造纸厂同科学研究机关相结合，大量地利用板皮和低等木材代替了高价原木制造高级印刷纸。仅国营吉林造纸厂利用板皮代替原木做工业用纸，五年来就给国家节省了四十多万立方公尺原木。
