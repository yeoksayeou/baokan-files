Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, October 20th:

The Soviet Union has trained 11,000 more engineers this year than last, reaching a total of 80,000. This number is more than three times the number of engineers trained in the United States this year, and almost twenty-seven times that of Britain and France combined. At present, the Soviet Union has more than twice as many engineers per capita as Britain.

The Soviet Union has long surpassed any capitalist country in training specialized personnel. In 1955 alone, the Soviet Union trained more than twice as many engineers as the United States in the same year. In the forty years since the establishment of the Soviet regime, the Soviet Union has trained a total of more than 3.8 million specialized personnel with higher education, including one million engineers.

In this year alone, the Soviet Union has trained as many as 770,000 specialized personnel with secondary and higher education levels, of which 265,000 have higher education levels. Next year, the number of specialized personnel with higher education will increase to 315,000, and the number of engineers among them will increase from 80,000 this year to 90,000.

The current state of development of Soviet education is: the number of people studying in schools at all levels and of all types is as high as 50 million, that is to say, one out of every four residents is receiving education. In Ukraine, 81 out of every 10,000 residents have received higher education, which is twice as many as in France and six times as many as in Turkey.

The Soviet Union began implementing universal compulsory education from the 1930-1931 academic year, and eliminated illiteracy by the end of the Second Five-Year Plan (1933-1937) (three-quarters of the population of old Russia was illiterate). During the period from 1949 to 1951, the country had basically achieved seven-year universal compulsory education. At present, the Soviet Union's national education is at a higher stage of development. Before 1960, the Soviet Union will realize ten-year universal compulsory education on the basis of seven-year universal compulsory education, and at the same time, comprehensive technical education will be greatly strengthened. At present, there are more than 213,000 schools in the country implementing universal compulsory education, with more than 30 million students.

There are now two million college students in the Soviet Union, which is sixteen times more than in pre-revolutionary Russia, and more than one and a half times more than the total number of college students in all European capitalist countries combined. Soviet higher education has developed particularly rapidly in the past decade or so. In 1940, the total number of college students was 812,000, and now this number has almost increased by one and a half times, of which the number of college students studying technology has increased by three and a half times.

    苏联教育事业成就辉煌
    每四个居民中就有一个人在受教育，大学生达二百万人，在培养专门人才方面远远超过任何资本主义国家，今年培养的工程师等于美国的三倍多
    据新华社莫斯科20日电  苏联今年培养出来的工程师比去年增加了一万一千人而达到八万人。这个数字等于美国今年培养的工程师的三倍多，几乎等于英国和法国的二十七倍。目前苏联按人口平均计算的工程师人数比英国多两倍以上。
    苏联在培养专门人才方面早已超过任何一个资本主义国家。在1955年这一年，苏联培养出来的工程师就等于美国同一年培养的工程师的两倍多。在苏维埃政权建立以来的四十年期间，苏联总共培养了三百八十多万受过高等教育的专门人才，其中有一百万工程师。
    在今年一年，苏联培养出来的具有中等和高等教育水平的专门人才高达七十七万人，其中具有高等教育水平的为二十六万五千人。明年培养出的具有高等教育水平的专门人才将增加到三十一万五千人，其中的工程师人数将由今年的八万人增加到九万人。
    苏联教育事业发展的现状是：在各级、各类学校中学习的人数有五千万之多，也就是说，每四个居民中就有一个人在受教育。在乌克兰，每一万个居民中就有八十一人受过高等教育，这比法国多一倍，比土耳其多六倍。
    苏联从1930—1931年学年起就开始实行了普及义务教育，早在第二个五年计划（1933—1937年）末就消灭了文盲（旧俄人口的四分之三是文盲）。在1949年到1951年期间，全国已经基本上实现了七年制的普及义务教育。目前，苏联的国民教育正处在更高的发展阶段。在1960年以前，苏联就将在七年制普及义务教育的基础上实现十年制普及义务教育，同时综合技术教育将大大加强。现在全国实行普及义务教育的学校已经有二十一万三千多所，学生有三千多万名。
    苏联的大学生现在有二百万人，相当于十月革命前俄国的十六倍，比现在欧洲所有资本主义国家的大学生总数多一倍半以上。苏联高等教育在最近十几年来发展特别迅速。在1940年，大学生的总数是八十一万二千名，而现在这个数字差不多已经增加了一倍半，其中学习技术的大学生增加了三倍半。
