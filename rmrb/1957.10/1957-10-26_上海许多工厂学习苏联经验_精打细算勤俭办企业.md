Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai. Many factories in Shanghai are spreading stories about how Soviet experts have helped us build the country thriftily.

When Soviet expert Lakiflin from the Shanghai Machine Tool Plant returned from vacation in the Soviet Union in March of this year, he learned that China was short of steel at the time. He personally organized and guided the plant's technicians to design and successfully trial-produce a roller nut weighing only about ten kilograms in thirteen days. This was used to replace the balance hammer weighing about four hundred kilograms in the S3726 surface grinder, saving a lot of iron.

The Shanghai tire industry, which was originally backward in production, changed the design structure and production methods of tires with the help of Soviet experts, increasing the mileage of tires by more than double. However, after the design and production methods were changed, some of the original equipment was no longer suitable. Some technicians advocated replacing it with new equipment; but in the end, with the direct help of Soviet experts, the new equipment was not replaced, but the old equipment was modified and utilized, thus saving a sum of investment.

Many technical materials and books introduced by the Soviet Union to China have also enabled Shanghai industrial technicians to learn a lot of experience in saving. Before liberation, Shanghai textile factories consumed a lot of flour every year in the slurry to pursue the beautiful appearance of the cloth. After liberation, the "light slurry method" practiced in Soviet textile factories was introduced to Shanghai; taking the State-owned No. 17 Cotton Mill, which mainly produces Longtou fine cloth, with an annual output of 2 million bolts, as an example, more than 2.54 million pounds of flour for sizing yarn are saved every year. After the printing and dyeing factory technicians learned the experience of chrome plating on printing rollers introduced by the Soviet Union, the same printing roller could originally only print several hundred to three thousand bolts of printed cloth, but now it can print more than ten thousand bolts.

After the mechanical and electrical factories generally adopted the design drawings supplied by the Soviet Union for production, the bulky and outdated product structure in the past was greatly changed, the product quality was improved, and raw materials were saved.

In the past few years, some large factories in Shanghai have also systematically learned from the Soviet Union's experience in managing enterprises thriftily. For example, learning from the Soviet enterprises' experience in implementing operation plans, responsibility systems, and technical management has improved management level and product quality; in particular, learning from the Soviet management enterprises' strict economic accounting system and raw material management system has greatly reduced waste in enterprise production and management.

In the construction and design departments, the effectiveness of applying the Soviet Union's experience in thrifty construction is also very prominent. After the construction department learned the Soviet Union's technical experience in saving metal, wood, and cement in construction, the cost of general mechanical factory buildings is now about half lower than it was three or four years ago.

### 上海许多工厂学习苏联经验  精打细算勤俭办企业

    上海许多工厂学习苏联经验
    精打细算勤俭办企业
    据新华社上海讯　在上海的很多工厂中都流传着苏联专家帮助我们勤俭建设的故事。
    上海机床厂的苏联专家拉基弗林今年3月从苏联休假回来的时候，知道当时中国钢铁缺乏，就亲自组织和指导厂里技术人员，在十三天内设计和试制成功一种仅重十公斤左右的滚柱螺帽，用来代替三七二六平面磨床中重约四百公斤的平衡锤，节约了很多铁。
    原来生产落后的上海轮胎工业，在苏联专家帮助下改变了轮胎的设计结构和生产方法，使轮胎的行驶里程提高一倍以上。但是，设计和生产方法改变以后，原来的一部分设备不适用了，有的技术人员便主张另换新的设备；可是最后在苏联专家的直接帮助下，并没有换新的设备，而是把旧的设备加以改装利用了，因而节省了一笔投资。
    苏联介绍到中国来的许多技术资料和书籍，也使上海工业技术人员学到很多节约经验。解放前，上海纺织厂为了追求布的外观漂亮，每年要消耗大量面粉用在浆料中。解放以后，苏联纺织厂中实行的“轻浆法”介绍到上海；单以主要生产龙头细布的国棉十七厂年产量二百万匹计算，每年就节约浆纱面粉二百五十四万多磅。印染厂技术人员学习了苏联介绍的在印花滚筒上镀铬的经验以后，同样一个印花滚筒，原来只能印几百匹到三千匹花布，现在可以印到一万多匹。
    机械、电机工厂中普遍采用苏联供给的设计图纸生产以后，很大程度上改变了过去笨重、陈旧的产品结构，提高了产品质量，节约了原材料。
    上海的一些大型工厂这几年还系统地学习了苏联勤俭管理企业的经验。如学习苏联企业中实行的作业计划、责任制度和技术管理等经验等，提高了管理水平和产品质量；特别是学习了苏联管理企业中严格的经济核算制度和原材料管理制度以后，大大减少了企业生产和管理中的浪费现象。
    在建筑、设计部门，运用苏联勤俭建设经验的成效也非常突出。建筑部门学习苏联建筑中节约金属、木材和水泥的技术经验以后，现在一般机械工厂厂房的造价大约比三、四年前降低一半左右。
