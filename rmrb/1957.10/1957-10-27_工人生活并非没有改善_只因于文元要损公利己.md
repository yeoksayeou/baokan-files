    Workers' lives have not failed to improve,
    Only because Yu Wenyuan seeks to benefit himself at public expense
    When Yu Wenyuan talked about the rent issue, he said: Only grade six workers really earn more than seventy yuan. Most workers do not earn that much. That is to say, the lives of workers below grade six are very hard, and they should not pay rent.
    Is this the truth? No, it is not. If you don't believe it, go and see the home of worker Zhang Rui. Zhang Rui is a grade five worker who supports a family of five, and he not only lives well, but also wears a watch and rides a new bicycle to and from work. Wang Bingxiao is a grade four worker who supports a family of six, and he also has a new bicycle, and a radio at home. Sun Zhongyuan is also a grade four worker who supports a family of seven. In addition to all the utensils, there is a new radio in the house, and he also rides a bicycle to and from work. We people can often eat rice and white flour, and we can eat some fish and meat every day. Although we are not grade six workers, can you say that our lives have not improved!
    You say that the comrade who signed as "Representative" is not a member of the working class; we say: You are wrong, you are not qualified to be a member of the working class, your mind is full of bourgeois ideas! What the "Representative" comrade said represents the interests of our broad working class!

### 工人生活并非没有改善  只因于文元要损公利己

    工人生活并非没有改善
    只因于文元要损公利己
    于文元在谈到房租的问题时说：真正拿到七十多元的只有六级工人，大多数工人都没有那么多工资。就是说六级以下工人的生活很苦，不应该交房租。
    事实是不是这样呢？不，不是的。不信，你到工人张瑞家里去看看就知道了。张瑞是个五级工，供养五口人生活，他不但生活得很好，而且还带着手表，上下班还骑着一辆新自行车。王炳孝是个四级工，供养六口人的生活，他也有一辆新自行车，而且家里还有收音机。孙仲元也是个四级工，供养七口人的生活，家里除了一切用具外，还有一架新的收音机，上下班同样骑着自行车。我们这些人，都能经常吃到大米白面，每天还能吃些鱼、肉。我们虽然不是六级工，你能说我们的生活没有改善！
    你说署名“代表”的同志，不是工人阶级队伍中的一员；我们说：你说错了，你才真正不够工人阶级的资格，脑子里充满了资产阶级的思想！“代表”同志所说的话，正代表了我们广大工人阶级的利益！
