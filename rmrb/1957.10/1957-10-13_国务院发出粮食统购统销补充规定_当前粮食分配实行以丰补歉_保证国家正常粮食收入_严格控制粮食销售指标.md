Xinhua News Agency, 12th – The State Council issued supplementary regulations on the unified purchase and sale of grain to the People's Committees of all provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government on October 11th. The full text is as follows:

　　The cooperativization of agricultural production has demonstrated enormous superiority, providing broad possibilities for fundamentally resolving China's grain problem. However, the realization of various agricultural production increase measures requires a relatively long period of time. During this period, the speed of grain production increase cannot be very rapid. On the other hand, due to population growth, increased grain use for production, and the universal increase in farmers' income after the transformation of the individual economy to a cooperative economy, farmers who previously consumed less grain have also increased their grain consumption. As a result, the grain needs of both urban and rural areas have greatly increased. At the same time, due to the impact of natural disasters, China's grain production is not stable enough, and the harvests vary greatly between years and regions. Under these circumstances, if grain consumption in rural and urban areas, especially in areas with good harvests, is not appropriately restricted, it will inevitably affect the essential grain supply to urban industrial and mining areas, economic crop areas, disaster areas, and other areas, hindering the smooth progress of national socialist construction. Therefore, the state must comprehensively consider and arrange the distribution of grain over a long period. The current policy should be: on the basis of adhering to the "three fixings" for grain, implement a system of using surplus from good harvests to compensate for poor harvests, guarantee normal state grain revenue, and strictly control grain sales. Based on this policy, the following supplementary regulations are made regarding the unified purchase and sale of grain.

　　(1) When the state calculates and verifies the amount of grain to be levied, purchased, or supplied to agricultural cooperatives and individual households, the grain retention standards stipulated when the "three fixings" for grain were implemented in 1955 shall not be raised, the amount of grain to be purchased by the state shall not be reduced, and the amount to be sold shall not be increased. The ration standards for people in disaster areas should be appropriately lowered; the ration standards for farmers in areas with poor harvests should also be lower than in normal years.

　　(2) For the portion of grain produced by agricultural cooperatives and individual households that exceeds the fixed production quantity of the "three fixings" for grain, the state must increase the purchase of a portion of the surplus grain from self-sufficient agricultural cooperatives and individual households; for grain-deficient agricultural cooperatives and individual households, the state must reduce the sale of a portion of grain. The amount of the state's increased purchase should generally be 40% of the increased production. In special circumstances, the purchase should be increased even more. However, the agricultural cooperatives and farmers should also benefit from the increased production to ensure the grain needs of the increasing population and livestock, appropriately store grain for disaster preparedness, or improve farmers' grain consumption, so as to motivate farmers to increase grain production.

　　(3) When the state verifies the amount of grain to be levied, purchased, or supplied to agricultural cooperatives, it shall not reduce the state's grain levy and purchase tasks or increase supply quotas because of the allotment of private plots to cooperative members. Cooperative members' private plots should generally only be used for growing feed and vegetables, and not for growing other economic crops. The production of other economic crops should be uniformly arranged by the agricultural cooperative.

　　(4) The unified purchase and sale of grain, agricultural tax collection, and state burdens for individual households must be handled strictly in accordance with state regulations. Individual households must obey the state's planting plans. The township people's committees may entrust the agricultural cooperatives where individual households are located to be responsible for handling these matters.

　　(5) After the completion of the rural grain purchase tasks, grain markets under state leadership were opened in the past to facilitate grain adjustments among farmers. In order to strengthen grain management in the future, these grain markets should be closed. After the closure, state grain agencies should, within the scope of possibility, assist agricultural cooperatives and farmers in adjusting grain varieties.

　　(6) After the state verifies the annual grain supply quantity for rural areas and towns, it must issue grain sales quotas level by level on a quarterly and monthly basis and resolutely implement them. The control targets issued by the State Council authorize the People's Committees of provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government to make appropriate adjustments when necessary. Regions and departments below the provincial level are not allowed to change the control targets stipulated by higher authorities without the approval of the provincial people's committee.

　　(7) The state's unified purchase and sale of grain should be combined with the internal grain distribution of agricultural cooperatives. When agricultural cooperatives distribute grain, they must strictly adhere to the following order: first, complete the state-verified grain levy and purchase tasks (including the increased purchase tasks of cooperatives with increased production); second, retain the seeds and feed necessary for agricultural cooperative production and distribute basic rations and necessary feed to all cooperative members; third, only after solving the above two problems can appropriate consideration be given to cooperative members who work harder and contribute more labor, or used to develop sideline occupations and raise more livestock, but it is not allowed to open restaurants or operate cooked food businesses. When agricultural cooperatives distribute grain within the cooperative, they should pay attention to storing grain for disaster preparedness.

　　If agricultural cooperatives experience a shortage of grain due to the payment of agricultural tax, the state can change the tax collection to the collection of cash or economic crops for all or part of the grain shortage when collecting agricultural tax.

　　It is appropriate for agricultural cooperatives to pre-distribute a portion of grain to cooperative members after the new grain harvest, but before completing the state-verified grain levy and purchase tasks, the pre-distributed portion must be lower than the grain retention standards stipulated in the "three fixings."

　　On the condition that the state-verified grain levy and purchase tasks are not reduced or supply quotas are not increased, agricultural cooperatives can adopt methods of distributing grain to cooperative members according to different levels and fixed quantities per person or other appropriate methods based on the actual situation, striving for fairness and reasonableness.

　　(8) In terms of urban unified sales, the ration standards for residents in areas where they are too high should be reasonably lowered. The grain used by collective catering units should be strictly rectified, and it is not allowed to falsely report the number of people or purchase more grain. The grain supply to people in towns and cities should be matched with a certain amount of sweet potatoes as much as possible. The grain used by industrial and commercial sectors should be strictly conserved and controlled.

　　If this supplementary regulation is inconsistent with the "Provisional Measures for Unified Purchase and Sale of Rural Grain" and the "Regulations of the State Council on Unified Purchase and Sale of Grain for Agricultural Production Cooperatives," this supplementary regulation shall prevail. Matters not mentioned in this supplementary regulation shall still be implemented in accordance with the previously promulgated provisional measures and regulations.

　　国务院发出粮食统购统销补充规定
    当前粮食分配实行以丰补歉
    保证国家正常粮食收入　严格控制粮食销售指标
    新华社12日讯　国务院在10月11日向各省、自治区、直辖市人民委员会发出关于粮食统购统销的补充规定。全文如下：
    农业生产的合作化已经显示了巨大的优越性，对于根本解决我国粮食问题提供了广阔的可能。但是，各项农业增产措施的实现，需要较长时间，在这个时间内，粮食增产的速度不可能是很快的。而在另一方面，由于人口的增加，生产用粮的增加，个体经济转变为合作经济以后，农民收入普遍有所增加，过去吃粮较少的农户，也增加了粮食消费量。这样，城市和农村的粮食需要就大大增加起来。同时，由于自然灾害的影响，我国的粮食生产还不够稳定，收成丰歉在年度间和地区间很不平衡。在这种情况下，农村和城市的粮食消费特别是丰收地区的粮食消费，如果不加适当节制，那就势必影响城市工矿区、经济作物区、灾区和其他方面必不可少的粮食供应，妨碍国家社会主义建设的顺利进行。因此，国家对于粮食的分配，在长时期内必须统筹兼顾，全面安排。当前的方针应该是：在坚持粮食三定的基础上，实行以丰补歉，保证国家正常的粮食收入，严格控制粮食的销售。根据这个方针，特对粮食统购统销作如下补充规定。
    （一）国家在计算和核定农业社和单干户粮食征收、收购或者供应数量的时候，1955年实行粮食“三定”时所规定的留粮标准不得提高，国家核定的粮食定购数量不得减少，定销数量不得增加。灾区人民的口粮标准，应该适当降低；收成较差地区农民的口粮标准，也应该比平常年景有所降低。
    （二）农业社和单干户生产的粮食，超过粮食“三定”定产数量的部分，国家对于余粮的和自足的农业社和单干户，必须增购一部分粮食；对于缺粮的农业社和单干户，必须减销一部分粮食。国家增购的数量，一般应为增产部分的40％，在特殊情况下，应该多增购一些；但是增产的部分，农业社和农民也应该有所得，以便用来保证人口和牲畜增加的粮食需要，适当储积备荒的粮食，或者改善农民的粮食消费状况，发挥农民增产粮食的积极性。
    （三）国家在核定农业社的粮食征收、收购或者供应数量的时候，不能因为分给社员自留地而减少国家的粮食征收、收购任务或者增加供应指标。社员的自留地，一般只能种植饲料和蔬菜，不能种植别的经济作物。别的经济作物的生产，应该由农业社统一安排。
    （四）对于单干户的粮食统购统销、农业税征收和国家负担，必须严格按照国家的规定办事。单干户必须服从国家的种植计划。这些事务乡人民委员会可以委托单干户所在地的农业社负责办理。
    （五）在农村粮食统购任务完成以后，过去为了农民相互间的粮食调剂，开放了国家领导下的粮食市场。今后为了加强粮食管理，此种粮食市场应该关闭。关闭以后，由国家粮食机构在可能范围内，帮助农业社和农民进行粮食品种的调剂。
    （六）国家在核定农村和市镇的全年粮食供应数量以后，必须按季分月逐级下达粮食销售指标，坚决执行。国务院下达的控制指标，授权省、自治区、直辖市人民委员会在必要时作适当调整。省级以下的地区和部门，没有经过省级人民委员会的批准，一律不准变动上级规定的控制指标。
    （七）国家的粮食统购统销，应该同农业社内部的粮食分配结合进行。农业社分配粮食，必须严格遵守下列先后顺序：第一、首先完成国家核定的粮食征收、收购任务（包括增产社的增购任务）；第二、留下农业社生产必需的种子和饲料，分给全体社员基本口粮和必要的饲料；第三、在解决了上述两项问题以后，才可以适当照顾劳动强出工多的社员，或者用来发展副业和多养牲畜，但是不准开设饭店和经营熟食品。农业社在社内分配粮食的时候，应该注意储积备荒的粮食。
    农业社由于缴纳农业税而发生缺粮情况，国家征收农业税的时候，对缺粮部分可以全部或部分改征代金或者经济作物。
    农业社在新粮收获以后，预分一部分粮食给社员是应该的，但在完成国家核定的粮食征收、收购任务以前，预分的部分必须低于“三定”时规定的留粮标准。
    农业社在不减少国家核定的粮食征收、收购任务或者不增加供应指标的条件下，对于社员口粮的分配，根据实际情况，可以采取以人分等定量的办法或者其他适宜的办法，力求公平合理。
    （八）在城市统销方面，居民口粮标准偏高的地方，应该把标准合理地降低下来。集体伙食单位用粮，应该严格整顿，不准虚报人数和多购粮食。市镇人民的口粮供应，应该尽可能搭配一定数量的红薯。工商行业用粮应该严格节约和控制。
    本补充规定同“农村粮食统购统销暂行办法”和“国务院关于农业生产合作社粮食统购统销的规定”不一致的，按照本补充规定执行。本补充规定没有提到的，仍然按照过去颁发的暂行办法和规定执行。
