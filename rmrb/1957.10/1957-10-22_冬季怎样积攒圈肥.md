    How to Accumulate Manure in Winter
    Yu Luohong, Production Small Team Leader of Lianxing Agricultural Cooperative, Majiazhai, Ding County
    In the past few years, our cooperative has focused on two measures in agricultural production: digging wells and accumulating fertilizer. Currently, all the land in the cooperative has become irrigated land. This year, the average application of coarse fertilizer per mu for spring-sown crops was twelve cartloads, three cartloads more than last year, and the application of coarse fertilizer per mu in high-yield land was twenty-five cartloads. Due to the vigorous development of water conservancy and increased fertilizer application, the yield has greatly increased, with a grain yield of 410 jin per mu, an increase of 40% compared to last year, transforming the cooperative from a grain-deficient one to a surplus one.
    The main method of accumulating fertilizer is to mobilize the members to raise more pigs. There are now 384 pigsties in the village, raising 529 pigs, double the number from last year, an average of 1.7 pigs per household. The manure accumulated by the members is assigned tasks and given reasonable remuneration based on quality. First-class fertilizer is recorded as 8 work points per cartload, second-class fertilizer as 7 work points, and third-class fertilizer as 6 work points. For exceeding the task, an additional work point is awarded per cartload, which enhances the enthusiasm of the members to accumulate fertilizer. For example, Yu Laoquan's family of four earned 1,000 work points from accumulating fertilizer this year, accounting for 25% of the family's total work points. Hu Jinshuan (the cripple) can also accumulate a cartload of manure every month. With more fertilizer accumulated by the members, the amount of fertilizer applied has also increased. This autumn, the cooperative planted 900 mu of wheat, with an average application of 15 cartloads of fertilizer per mu, 250 mu of large-area high-yield wheat with 25 cartloads of fertilizer per mu, and 30 mu of high-yield wheat with 30 cartloads of fertilizer per mu, creating favorable conditions for a bumper wheat harvest next year.
    Pen manure is also an important source of fertilizer for our cooperative. In order to increase pen manure, we also utilize winter to accumulate it in addition to the summer and autumn seasons. In the past, the accumulation of pen manure was mainly in the summer and autumn seasons. Once winter arrived, the manure pits would freeze, and filling them with straw would not rot, thus affecting the quantity and quality of fertilizer accumulation. In the winter of 1954, after the higher Party committee called for carrying out winter fertilizer accumulation work, the villagers could not think of good ways to do it, especially the elderly, who had no confidence in winter fertilizer accumulation. Later, we found that the reason why we could not accumulate much fertilizer in winter was that the manure pits were frozen. If we could prevent the manure pits from freezing, this problem would be solved. Therefore, we decided to try the method of covering the manure pits with straw mats. After "Minor Snow," we placed wooden sticks horizontally over the manure pits, covered them with straw mats, covered them in the evenings and mornings, and uncovered them at noon. Sure enough, the pits did not freeze that winter, and we accumulated three cartloads of manure in one winter. The manure pits that were not covered with straw mats only accumulated one cartload in one winter. From this, we realized the benefits of covering pigsty pits with straw mats in winter: they can keep warm and prevent freezing, the straw heats up quickly and rots easily, and the pigs go to the manure pits more often, which makes the straw, manure, and soil mix evenly, thus improving the quality of the manure. In the spring sowing of 1955, every 100 heads of garlic grown with unfrozen manure weighed seven jin, while every 100 heads grown with frozen manure weighed two jin.
    In the winter of 1955, this method was promoted throughout the village. By the winter of 1956, all the pigsty pits in the village were covered with straw mats. The implementation of this method created conditions for winter fertilizer accumulation. Generally, a pigsty can accumulate one cartload of manure per month.
    With more fertilizer accumulated, attention should also be paid to preservation, because the fertilizer accumulated in winter will be used for sowing next year. If attention is not paid to preservation, it will lose its effectiveness after being exposed to wind and sun. Our cooperative has two methods of fertilizer preservation: one is to dig pits in the ground before it freezes, fill the manure in the pits, cover it with six to seven inches of soil, tamp it down, and flatten it, and then take it out when sowing. The fertilizer preserved in this way is black in color and has a strong odor. The second method is to haul the manure to the field and pile it up, pile it up and flatten it, and cover it all around with soil or seal it with slippery straw mud. This avoids wind and rain and sun exposure, prevents the loss of fertilizer, and thus improves the effectiveness of the fertilizer.

    冬季怎样积攒圈肥
    定县马家寨联星农业社生产小队长　于洛宏
    几年来，我们社在农业生产上，着重抓住了打井和积肥两项措施。目前全社的土地都变成了水浇地，今年春播作物，平均每亩施粗肥十二车，比去年多施三车，丰产地每亩施粗肥二十五车。由于大力开展水利和增施肥料，产量大大提高，粮食亩产达到四百一十斤，比去年增产40％，由缺粮社变为余粮社。
    积肥办法主要是发动社员多养猪。现在全村共有猪圈三百八十四个，养猪五百二十九口，比去年增加一倍，平均每户养猪一点七口。社员积的圈肥，是分配任务并按质量给以合理的报酬，一等肥每车记八分工，二等肥记七分工，三等肥记六分工，对超过任务的每车再奖给一分工，这就提高了社员积肥的积极性。如于老全全家四口人，今年积肥得工分一千个，占全家总工分25％。胡金栓（拐子）每月也能积一圈肥。社员积肥多了，施肥的数量也就增加了，全社今秋种麦九百亩，平均每亩施肥十五车，二百五十亩大面积增产麦，每亩施肥二十五车，三十亩丰产麦，每亩施肥三十车，给明年小麦丰收准备了有利条件。
    圈肥也是我们社的一项重要肥源。我们为了增加圈肥，在夏秋两季以外，还利用冬季积圈肥。过去积攒圈肥，主要是夏秋两季，一到冬天，圈坑就要结冰，填上柴草沤不烂，所以就影响积肥的数量和质量。1954年冬季，上级党号召开展冬季积肥工作后，老乡们都想不出好的办法来，特别是老年人，对冬季积肥更没有信心。后来我们找出冬季不能多积肥的原因是圈坑冻冰，如果不让圈坑结冻，这个问题就解决了。于是决定用草苫子盖圈坑的方法试一试。到“小雪”后，在圈坑上横架上木棍，上面盖上草苫子，晚上早晨盖上，中午揭开，这年冬天果然没有冻圈，一冬攒了三圈粪，没有盖草苫的圈坑，一冬只能攒一圈。我们从此体会到冬季猪圈坑盖草苫的好处是：能保温不冻圈，柴草发热快沤的烂，猪到圈坑去的次数多了，使柴草、粪、土混合均匀，就提高了粪的质量。1955年春季播种用不冻圈肥种的每一百头蒜七斤，以施用结冻圈肥的每一百头重二斤。
    1955年冬季，这个方法在全村推广了。到1956年冬季，全村所有的猪圈坑，都盖上草苫子。推行这个办法后，就给冬季积肥创造了条件，一般猪圈一月能积一圈肥。
    积肥多了还要注意保存，因为冬天积的肥要到明年播种时使用，如果不注意保存，经过风吹和日晒，就要跑劲。我们社里保肥的方法有二种：一种是在地未冻时，在地头挖坑，把粪填在坑里，上面盖上六、七寸厚的土，砸实拍平，播种时再起出来，这样保的肥料颜色黑，臭味大。第二种是把粪拉到地里堆起来，堆好拍平，四周用土盖好或用滑秸泥封起来。这样就避免了风吹雨淋和日晒，防止了肥分的流失，因而提高了肥料的效力。
