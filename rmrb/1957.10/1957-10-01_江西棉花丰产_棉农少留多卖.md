    Jiangxi Cotton Bumper Harvest
    Cotton Farmers Retain Less and Sell More
    (Our newspaper dispatch) This year, Jiangxi's total cotton production will increase by more than 20% compared to last year. Cotton farmers are celebrating the bumper harvest and actively selling new cotton.
    As of September 20th, the province had sold more than 66,000 dan of new cotton, exceeding the September sales target ahead of schedule.
    This year, the unit yield of cotton in many areas of Jiangxi has greatly increased. Jiangbei District of Pengze County has become the first "100-jin ginned cotton district" in the province; in Jinxian County, the average yield of more than 82,000 mu of cotton fields has increased by more than 77% compared to last year. The quality of cotton has also improved significantly.
    Cotton farmers have generally achieved separate picking, drying, storage, and sales, and have also prioritized the state over personal interests, retaining less and selling more; the average retention in concentrated cotton-producing areas is one to one and a half jin of cotton, while in scattered cotton-producing areas, generally no cotton is retained.

    江西棉花丰产
    棉农少留多卖
    本报讯  今年江西棉花总产量将比去年增加20％以上。棉农们喜庆丰收，踊跃地交售新棉。
    截至9月20日止，全省共交售新棉六万六千多担，提前超额完成了9月份的交售任务。
    今年江西不少地区棉花单位面积产量大大提高了。彭泽县江北区已成为全省第一个“百斤皮棉区”；进贤县八万二千多亩棉田，平均每亩比去年增产77％强。棉花的品质也有显著提高。
    棉农们普遍做到了分摘分晒分存分售，还做到了先国家后个人，少留多卖；集中产棉区留用量平均为一斤到一斤半棉花，分散产棉区一般不留。    （江西省供销社）
