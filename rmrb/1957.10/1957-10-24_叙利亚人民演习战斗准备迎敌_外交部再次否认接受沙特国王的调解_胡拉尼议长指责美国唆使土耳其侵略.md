Xinhua News Agency report: Damascus News: According to Syrian newspapers, the Syrian People's Resistance Organization is conducting combat exercises, especially street fighting exercises, to prepare to meet the invaders. Many parliamentarians were wearing uniforms when attending parliamentary sessions.

The Syrian Trade Union Federation distributed leaflets in Damascus, calling on all classes to unite against the enemies who attempt to steal Syria's freedom - Western colonialism, Zionism, and Turkey.

Syria's Grand Mufti (Islamic legal explainer) Abul Yusr Abidin, in a letter to the people of the country on the 22nd, warmly welcomed the Egyptian army's assistance to Syria. He called on the people to be vigilant and prepare to respond to the call for a possible holy war.

The Syrian Minister of Education said on the 22nd that the youth army composed of 20,000 students is in a state of mobilization like the Syrian army and is undergoing military training every day.

At the same time, Syrian women and girls are receiving first aid training and will then receive weapons training.

These facts show that the heroic Syrian people, both men and women, have been mobilized and are prepared to fight to defend national independence and world peace.

The Syrian Foreign Ministry issued a statement on the evening of the 22nd, again denying that Syria had agreed to the Saudi Arabian King's "mediation" for Syria and Turkey, and reiterated Syria's determination to accuse Turkey in the United Nations.

The statement pointed out that the situation between Syria and Turkey cannot be a matter of mediation, because the situation can be resolved as long as the Turkish troops gathered on the Syrian border withdraw and Turkish politicians stop attacking Syria and interfering in Syria's internal affairs.

The statement said that the Saudi Arabian side believes that the exchange of letters between the Saudi King and President Kuwatly is a suggestion and acceptance of mediation. However, the Syrian side absolutely does not believe that the Saudi King's letter contains a suggestion of mediation.

Syrian Parliament Speaker Hurani told a United Press reporter on the 22nd that Turkish troops began to gather on the Syrian border shortly after US Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Henderson recently visited Ankara.

Hurani said that Syria had purchased Soviet weapons. He said that the reason Syria needs weapons is "because Israel is constantly carrying out aggressive activities on our borders."

Hurani said: "We will not allow any country, Turkey or any other country, to interfere in our internal affairs."

    外交部再次否认接受沙特国王的调解
    胡拉尼议长指责美国唆使土耳其侵略
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：大马士革消息：据叙利亚报纸报道，叙利亚人民抵抗组织正在举行战斗演习，特别是巷战演习，准备迎击侵略者。许多议员在参加议会会议时都穿着制服。
    叙利亚工会联合会在大马士革散发传单，要求各个阶级团结起来，反对企图盗窃叙利亚的自由的敌人——西方殖民主义、犹太复国主义和土耳其。
    叙利亚的大穆弗蒂（伊斯兰教法典说明官）阿布勒·尤苏尔·阿卜丁22日在给全国人民的信件中，热烈欢迎埃及军队援助叙利亚。他要求人民提高警惕，准备响应可能发生的圣战的号召。
    叙利亚教育部长22日说，由两万名学生组成的青年军同叙利亚陆军一样正处于动员状态，每天在受军事训练。
    同时，叙利亚的妇人和少女们正在接受急救工作的训练，然后将接受使用武器的训练。
    这些事实表明英勇的叙利亚人民，无论男女都已经动员起来，准备为了保卫国家独立和世界和平而战。
    叙利亚外交部22日晚间发表公报，再次否认叙利亚同意沙特阿拉伯国王为叙利亚和土耳其“调解”，并且重申叙利亚决心在联合国中控诉土耳其。
    公报指出，叙利亚同土耳其之间存在的局势不能够成为调解的问题，因为只要集结在叙利亚边境上的土耳其军队撤退，土耳其的政治家停止攻击叙利亚和干涉叙利亚的内政，局势就能够得到解决。
    公报说，沙特阿拉伯方面认为沙特国王同库阿特利总统交换信件是建议调解和接受调解。但是，叙利亚方面绝对不认为沙特国王的信件中包含调解的建议。
    叙利亚议会议长胡拉尼22日对合众社记者发表谈话说，在美国副国务卿帮办汉德逊最近访问了安卡拉之后不久，土耳其军队就开始集结在叙利亚边界上。
    胡拉尼说，叙利亚曾购买过苏联武器。他说，叙利亚所以需要武器，是“因为以色列不断地对我们的边界进行侵略活动。”
    胡拉尼说：“我们将不允许任何国家，土耳其或是任何其他国家，干涉我们的内政。”
