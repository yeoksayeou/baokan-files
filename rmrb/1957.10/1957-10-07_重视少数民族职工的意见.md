    Valuing the Opinions of Ethnic Minority Workers
    (Our report) The Karamay Mining Bureau is actively improving its work during the rectification campaign.
    In the past, during drilling, the geological department often requested drilling to be stopped in order to take core samples, collect geological data, and understand formation changes; however, the well teams, in order to achieve higher footage, demanded continued drilling, often neglecting wellbore coring. This contradiction had existed for a long time. To resolve this issue, the drilling department designated the bureau's chief engineer and chief geologist to be responsible for research. After adopting various technical measures, both drilling footage and core sampling have been completed relatively well. The core recovery rate in the second quarter increased from 32.2% in the first quarter to 45%, and the drilling footage was also completed at 101.4%. To ensure the safety of workers in production, the mining bureau issued aluminum safety helmets to workers in drilling, derrick installation, and other departments.
    The Mining Bureau and the Party Committee also pay attention to promptly resolving criticisms and opinions raised by ethnic minority workers. Uyghur workers account for the majority of ethnic minority workers in the mining area, but in the past, the Mining Bureau mostly used Chinese in its official documents, which affected the work to some extent. After adjusting the translators and Uyghur typists, now, except for some technical documents that cannot be translated, other documents are available in Uyghur. At the same time, a group of ethnic minority cadres has been promoted to strengthen the leadership of various units, so that the opinions of ethnic minority workers can be promptly reflected to the leadership.

    重视少数民族职工的意见
    本报讯　克拉玛依矿务局在整风当中，积极地改进工作。
    过去钻井时，地质部门为了取岩心，收集地质资料，了解地层变化情况，往往要求停钻；但井队人员为了争取较多的进尺，要求继续钻进，往往忽视井壁取心。这个矛盾存在已久。为了解决这个问题，钻井处指定该局总工程师和主任地质师负责研究。经过多方面采取技术措施，已使钻井进尺和取岩心的工作都完成得比较好。第二季度的岩心收获率由第一季度的32.2％提高到45％，钻井进尺也完成了101.4％。为了保证工人安全生产，矿务局给钻井、井架安装等部门工人发了铝制的安全帽。
    矿务局和党委会也注意及时解决少数民族职工提出的批评和意见。矿区的维吾尔族职工在少数民族职工中占多数，但过去矿务局在行文方面，多用汉文，使工作受到一定影响。调整了翻译员和维吾尔文打字员后，现在除了一些技术性的文件还不能翻译外，其他文件都有维吾尔文。同时，提拔了一批少数民族干部，充实了各单位的领导，使少数民族工人的意见能够及时反映给领导。
