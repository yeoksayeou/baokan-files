The People's Daily News: Over the past three months, more than 7,000 employees of the First Ministry of Machine Building have, based on a wealth of facts and reasoning debates with rightists, effectively crushed the rightists' frenzied attacks, and the masses' socialist consciousness has also been significantly raised.
　　The anti-Rightist struggle in this ministry has been fully launched with the organic coordination and simultaneous advancement of the ministry's central battlefield, the bureau and department's main battlefield, and secondary battlefields. For example, after criticizing Lei Tianjue, all employees of the Institute of Mechanical Sciences launched an exposure and criticism of Yun Zhen, an engineer at the institute and a member of the Beijing branch of the Jiusan Society. Before liberation, Yun Zhen had long served as a representative of bureaucratic capitalists and the chief representative of the puppet Resources Committee in the United States, and consistently hated the people's cause. During the Great Blooming and Contending, he released a series of poisonous arrows, and wrote to Xu Deheng, chairman of the Jiusan Society, praising Chu Anping's fallacies as "very bold, very sharp, and very pertinent." His rightist words and deeds aroused the comrades' unparalleled anger and were met with fierce counterattacks.
　　Liu Huandong, a rightist element in the Fourth Bureau, was an engineer in the bureau and a member of the Peasant and Workers Democratic Party branch. After criticism by all employees of the Fourth Bureau, he was subsequently surrounded and attacked by the Minmeng [China Democratic League] and Peasant and Workers Democratic Party branches. Now he is at his wit's end and has had to admit that he is a member of the Zhang-Luo alliance. Lei Tianjue, a rightist element in the Institute of Mechanical Sciences, was criticized at a general staff meeting in early August, and then surrounded and attacked in small and large meetings in the institute for days. He has now had to begin to express repentance and request reform. On the joint battlefield of the Automobile Bureau and the Design Bureau, directly under the control of the ministry, meetings were held continuously to criticize Zhang Guanghua, deputy director of the translation office of the Automobile Bureau Research Institute, for the fallacy that "the present is not as good as the past." Ding Zhongbao, a young technician at the Design Bureau, was also severely criticized for his "ten thousand word letter" attacking the Party. Ding Zhongbao wrote to the Party Central Committee to challenge it at the height of the Great Blooming and Contending. He did his best to distort and exaggerate the five major movements and three major transformations since liberation, attacking the leadership of the Party and socialism. At the debate meetings, comrades refuted him with a wealth of information and systematic analysis, and also refuted his absurd statements that "the proletariat in capitalist society is not absolutely impoverished" and "there has been no economic crisis in world capitalism in the past twenty years." Zhao Songfei, Liu Bingji, and Zhou Taibao, rightist elements within the Party, like the rightist elements outside the Party, had their anti-Party words and deeds criticized and suppressed by their comrades.
　　In the process of the struggle deepening, the rightists within the party split, and more deeply hidden rightist elements and small rightist groups were constantly exposed. For example, the Second Bureau's Machine Tool Research Institute exposed a small group organization led by Zeng Shengzheng and Liang Mingchang.
　　The anti-Rightist struggle not only crushed the rightists, but also greatly educated the cadres of the departments. For example, in order to criticize the fallacy that "the unified purchase and sale of grain has been messed up," some comrades went to the Beijing Library to read materials, and even dug up the national grain figures for 1927. In order to defend Marxism-Leninism, the Design Bureau, during the great debate on the two roads with rightist remarks, had an unprecedentedly strong atmosphere of studying Marxism-Leninism, and the comrades in the translation office voluntarily bought some classic works. Many engineering and technical personnel are concerned about political learning theory in the struggle against the Rightists. At the meeting to criticize Lei Tianjue, the chief engineer of the Third Bureau, who had a deep relationship with Lei, stood up and asked to speak and criticize after listening to everyone's exposure and criticism. Some young people who were usually confused by Lei rose up to expose him more and more in the struggle.
　　In addition, the big-character posters and blackboards of the department effectively cooperated with the anti-Rightist struggle.
　　In order to arm the masses, the department's Rectification Leadership Group also printed and distributed various reference documents and regularly reported to the masses. All units have organized theoretical research groups to help the masses systematically criticize various rightist arguments. Many people reflected: "The reasoning meeting is a battlefield for the rightists, and a classroom for ourselves," "Several debate meetings are better than ten years of study."

    几次辩论会  胜读十年书
    第一机械工业部反右派说理斗争深入开展
    本报讯　第一机械工业部机关七千多职工，三个多月来，根据大量事实和右派分子进行说理辩论的结果，已有效地粉碎了右派分子的猖狂进攻，群众的社会主义觉悟也有了显著的提高。
    这个部的反右派斗争是在部的中心战场、局司的主要战场和次要战场有机配合齐头并进中全面展开的。如机械科学研究院全体职工继批判雷天觉之后，又对该院工程师、九三学社北京分社委员恽震展开揭露和批判。恽震解放前长期充当官僚资本家代表、伪资源委员会驻美总代表，一贯仇视人民事业。大鸣大放中，他曾放出一系列毒箭，并曾上书九三学社主席许德珩称赞储安平的谬论“很大胆、很尖锐、很中肯”。他的右派言行激起同志们的无比愤怒，遭到猛力反击。
    四局右派分子刘焕东是该局工程师、农工民主党支部委员。在四局全体职工批判后，继在民盟和农工党支部中集力围攻，现已词穷理屈，不得不承认自己是章罗联盟的一员。机械科学研究院右派分子雷天觉在8月初全部职工大会批判后，又在院内连日小会大会的围攻，现不得不开始表示悔罪要求改造。在部直接掌握的汽车局和设计总局联合战场上，曾连续开会批判汽车局研究所翻译室副主任张光华“今不如昔”的谬论。对设计总局青年技术员丁忠宝向党进攻的“万言书”也进行了严正批驳。丁忠宝在大鸣大放的高潮时上书党中央进行挑战。并对解放以来的五大运动三大改造，竭尽其歪曲渲染的能事，攻击党的领导和社会主义。辩论会上同志们以大量资料和系统的分析进行驳斥，会上也据理批驳了他的“资本主义社会里无产阶级没有绝对贫困化”；和“二十年来世界资本主义没有经济危机”的滥言。党内右派分子赵松飞、刘炳骥、周泰宝也和党外右派分子一样，他们的反党言行，遭到同志们的批驳围剿。
    在斗争往纵深发展的过程中，右派内部分化，不断揭发出隐藏较深的右派分子和右派小集团。如二局机床研究所就揭发出以曾声铮、梁铭常联盟的小集团组织。
    反右派斗争不仅是粉碎了右派，而且也大大地教育了机关干部。如为要批判“粮食统购统销搞糟了”这一谬论，有的同志到北京图书馆阅读资料，甚至把1927年全国粮食数字都翻出来了。设计总局为了保卫马列主义，在和右派言论展开两条道路的大辩论时，学习马列主义的空气空前浓厚，翻译室的同志自动买了一些经典著作。不少工程技术人员在反击右派斗争中，关心政治学习理论。在批判雷天觉的大会上，和雷关系很深的三局总工程师听了大家的揭发和批判后，也起来要求发言批判。平时受雷迷惑的一些青年，在斗争中愈来愈多地起来揭发。
    另外，该部的大字报、黑板报有力配合了反右派斗争。
    为了武装群众，部局整风领导小组也印发了各种参考文件，定期向群众做报告。各单位都组织了理论研究组，帮助群众有系统地批判各种右派论点。许多群众反映：“说理大会对右派是战场，对自己是课堂”，“几次辩论会，胜读十年书”。
