　　China Tea Export Company Sets Off a High Tide of Rectification
    Heated Debate on Plans to Adjust Organizational Structure and Reduce Personnel

    (Our Newspaper) News - The walls and corridors surrounding the China Tea Export Company of the Ministry of Foreign Trade are now covered with colorful dazibao (big-character posters). Some of these dazibao criticize the shortcomings of certain leaders of the company; some expose the company's overstaffing; and some concern the company's scope of responsibilities, organizational structure, and work systems. In the company's rectification reception room, the manager and deputy managers have received nearly thirty cadres over the past week or so. The cadres who came to talk have raised many criticisms and suggestions, and some cadres have even engaged in debates with the managers who received them in the reception room.

    The China Tea Export Company has fewer than one hundred employees. Within just ten days of the rectification movement entering the rectification and improvement phase, more than three hundred dazibao related to rectification and work improvement have been posted, and all staff members have actively participated in the upsurge of airing views freely, contending, debating, and making improvements in a big way. The reason for this is not only the company leadership's determination to resolutely improve its work and style but also the fact that the company's rectification leading group carefully carried out a series of organizational and publicity work before transitioning to the rectification and improvement phase.

    In late September, the company's anti-rightist struggle achieved a great victory, the rightists had bowed their heads in admitting their guilt, and the masses' political consciousness had generally improved. In order to guide the masses to better transition to the rectification and improvement phase, the leading group, on the one hand, seized the time to seriously analyze and study the opinions raised by the staff and workers during the airing of views freely in May and June, and immediately began to resolve problems that should be resolved and could be resolved quickly, such as those related to employee benefits and individual work systems. This enhanced the masses' confidence in the rectification and improvement; at the same time, the leading group also seriously studied and analyzed the ideological situation of the masses, as well as the main problems existing in the company's current work and among some leading cadres, and found that there were relatively common concerns among general cadres, such as fear of being criticized and targeted for saying the wrong thing in the big contention and debate; fear that after criticizing leading cadres, these cadres would give them a hard time after the movement was over; fear that raising opinions would be useless; fear that criticism would hurt the feelings between comrades, etc. Some leading cadres and party member cadres with more serious shortcomings were afraid that the rectification would burn them, fearing that they would not pass the test.

    In response to these situations, the rectification leading group held separate party member congresses, Communist Youth League member congresses, and meetings of leading cadres above the section chief level in late September to analyze and criticize various erroneous ideas. Individual talks were also held with individual comrades who had more shortcomings to dispel their ideological concerns. Then, on October 4, a general meeting of all staff members was held to mobilize them and dispel the masses' ideological concerns. Thus, the mass airing of views and contention began. Debate meetings, thematic research meetings, and heart-to-heart talks organized by the rectification leading group and organized automatically by cadres were held one after another. Dazibao also sprang up like mushrooms after a rain, with seventy-four being posted in a very short time. The manager, section chiefs, and even the cooks posted dazibao, some expressing their determination to accept criticism and welcome criticism, and some raising sharp criticisms to the leadership and certain cadres.

    Now, the Tea Company's rectification movement has shifted from the stage of generally criticizing the leadership and making suggestions to each other to the stage of debating with specific issues as the center. Currently, the most intense debate is about organizational structure. This was triggered by the initial exposure of overstaffing in dazibao that said "nothing to do at work, drinking tea, reading newspapers, and chatting nonsense." From October 4th to 12th, more than thirty dazibao related to this issue were posted, proposing eight plans for adjusting the organizational structure and reducing personnel. After a week of debate, the truth became clearer, and opinions gradually converged, with six proposals being automatically withdrawn by the proposers. Now, only the proposal of Su Han Chi, head of the business department, and Sun Zheng and others, which is "to reduce personnel by 40% on the basis of preserving the original organization of the Tea Company," and the proposal of Wu Maozheng and Wang Ximin of the Finance Department, which is "to merge the Tea Company with the Export Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Trade to form a commodity bureau, reducing personnel by 70%," remain. People who agree with these two proposals account for about half each. Those who advocate preserving the Tea Company believe that: first, the Tea Company is an enterprise management agency, and the Export Bureau is an administrative management agency, the two are different in nature and cannot be merged; second, China's tea exports have a long history, and future export tasks will increase, so we must look at the issue from the perspective of business development; third, the tea export business has great technical requirements, the quality and taste of tea need special techniques to identify, and there must be an agency dedicated to this. Those who advocate merging the Tea Export Company with the Export Bureau believe that: first, the Ministry of Foreign Trade has a bureau under it, and the bureau has a professional company under it. Although one is an administrative management agency and the other is an enterprise management agency, the business they manage is basically the same. After the merger, not only can the levels be reduced, a large number of personnel can be reduced, and bureaucracy and red tape can be overcome, but also work efficiency can be greatly improved, and the phenomenon of mutual buck-passing between agencies can be reduced; second, delegating some purely technical businesses to the grassroots can further promote the work enthusiasm of the grassroots business units; third, whether administrative agencies can be merged with enterprise management agencies depends on the specific situation, and one cannot rigidly adhere to certain clauses. The big debate on this issue is still in full swing.

    According to the person in charge of the company's rectification leading group, the leadership of the Ministry of Foreign Trade has also conducted special research on the main issues debated by the company. Regarding the issue of adjusting the organizational structure, the ministry has initially drafted a plan based on the opinions raised by the masses. After further study, it can be handed over to the masses for further discussion.

### 中国茶叶出口公司整改形成高潮  正在热烈辩论调整组织机构减少人员方案

　　中国茶叶出口公司整改形成高潮
    正在热烈辩论调整组织机构减少人员方案
    本报讯  在对外贸易部中国茶叶出口公司的院子四周的墙壁上、走廊里，已经贴满了五光十色的大字报。这些大字报有的是批评公司某些领导同志缺点的；有的是揭发公司人浮于事的；有的则是关于公司职责范围、组织机构和工作制度等方面的。在公司的整风接待室里，近一个多星期来，公司的经理、副经理等负责同志已经先后接见了近三十名干部。来谈的干部提出了许多批评和建议，有的干部在接待室里就同接待他们的经理展开辩论。
    中国茶叶出口公司现有工作人员不到一百人，当整风运动刚刚开始转入整改阶段的短短十天之内，就已经贴出了三百多张有关整风和改进工作的大字报，全体工作人员都积极地参加到大鸣大放大争大改的热潮中了。所以能够这样，除了公司领导上有坚决改进工作和作风的决心之外，主要是由于公司整风领导小组在转入整改以前认真进行了一系列的组织工作和宣传工作。
    9月下旬，公司的反右派斗争取得了很大胜利，右派分子已经低头认罪，群众的政治觉悟普遍提高。领导小组为了引导群众更好地转入整改阶段，一面抓紧时间将职工群众在5、6月间大鸣大放时所提的意见进行了认真的分析和研究，把应当解决而又能够很快解决的问题，如有关职工福利和个别工作制度等方面的问题，都立即着手解决。这就增强了群众对整改的信心；同时，领导小组又认真研究和分析了群众的思想情况，以及公司当前工作上和部分领导干部中所存在的主要问题，发现在一般干部中比较普遍地有顾虑，如怕在大争大辩中说错了话挨整；怕批评领导干部后，运动一过，这些干部给自己“小鞋”穿；怕提了意见不顶事；怕批评会伤同志间的感情等。而一些缺点比较严重的领导干部和党员干部，则害怕整风烧到自己身上，怕过不了关。
    整风领导小组针对这些情况，在9月底分别召开了党员大会、团员大会和科长处长以上的领导干部会议，分析和批判了各种错误思想。对个别缺点较多的同志，又分别进行了个别谈话，解除了他们的思想顾虑。接着就在10月4日召开了全体工作人员大会进行动员，解除了群众的思想顾虑。于是群众性的大鸣大争开始了。由整风领导小组组织的和干部自动组织的辩论会、专题研究会、促膝谈心会等接连不断举行。大字报也像雨后春笋一样，在很短的时间内就贴出了七十四张。经理、处长以及炊事员都贴出了大字报，有的表示自己接受批评、欢迎批评的决心，有的向领导上和某些干部提出了尖锐的批评。
    现在，茶叶公司的整风运动已经由一般地对领导提批评意见和互相提意见的阶段转到以专门问题为中心进行辩论的阶段。目前争论最激烈的是关于组织机构问题。这是由大字报上最初揭发“上班无事干，喝茶、看报、胡扯谈”的人浮于事现象引起的。从10月4日到12日有关这个问题的大字报就贴出了三十多张，提出了八个关于调整组织机构减少人员的方案。经过一个星期来的争论，真理愈辩愈明，意见逐渐趋向一致，有六个方案已经由提案人自动撤销了。现在只剩下业务处处长宿汉池和孙正等提出的“在保存茶叶公司原有机构的基础上减少人员40％”的方案，和财务处吴茂正、王锡民等提出的“茶叶公司与外贸部出口局合并成立商品局，减少人员70％”的方案。同意这两种方案的人约各占一半。主张保存茶叶公司的人认为：一、茶叶公司是企业管理机关，出口局是行政管理机关，两者性质不同，不能合并；二、中国茶叶的出口已有悠久的历史，将来出口任务还要增加，要从业务发展的观点看问题；三、茶叶出口业务有很大技术性，茶的品质、滋味等的好坏，都需要专门技术来鉴定，必须有一个机关专司其事。主张茶叶出口公司与出口局合并的人认为：一、对外贸易部部下设局，局下又设专业公司，虽然一个是行政管理机关，一个是企业管理机关，但所管业务基本相同，合并之后，不但可以减少层次，减少大批人员，克服官僚主义和文牍主义，可以大大提高工作效率，减少机关和机关之间互相扯皮现象；二、把一些纯技术性的业务下放到基层，可以更加发挥基层业务单位的工作积极性；三、行政机关能不能与企业管理机关合并，要根据具体情况而定，不能死啃住某些条文不放。现在有关这个问题的大辩论仍在热烈进行。
    据该公司整风领导小组负责人谈，对外贸易部领导方面对该公司所辩论的主要问题，也进行了专门的研究。关于调整组织机构问题，部里根据群众提出的意见已经初步拟出了一个方案，待进一步研究后，就可以交给群众作更深一步的讨论。
