    Han Yu's Tomb Re-Embellished
    The tomb of Han Yu, a famous writer of the Tang Dynasty, has recently been renovated by the Meng County cultural department in Henan Province.
    Han Yu's tomb is located in Hanzhuang Village, west of Meng County, Henan Province, bordering the Yellow River to the south and surrounded by mountains to the north. There are twin ancient Tang cypresses standing in the tomb, and the scenery is beautiful. Due to disrepair over the years, the mountain gate of the tomb was on the verge of collapse, and the walls were dilapidated. This time, the county cultural department allocated funds for repairs. In addition to the complete renovation of the mountain gate, other parts were also repaired. After the renovation, the inside and outside of the tomb look brand new, quiet and pleasant.

    韩愈墓地重加修葺
    唐代著名文学家韩愈的墓地，最近由河南孟县文化部门加以修葺。
    韩愈墓地在河南孟县城西韩庄村，南靠黄河，北有群山怀抱，院内有唐柏双奇，矗立墓地，风景优美。由于年久失修，墓地山门即将倾塌，垣墙颓废。这次县文化部门拨款修理，除山门完全翻修外，其他部分也作了修补。经过整修以后，墓地内外焕然一新，幽静可观。
