Xinhua News Agency, 10th. Two scientific workers observing the artificial satellite at the Beijing Planetarium saw a bright spot using an ordinary telescope between 7:15 and 7:16 this morning. It quickly flashed from northwest to southeast. The person in charge of the planetarium confirmed: the bright spot seen was the artificial satellite, or the rocket carrying the artificial satellite.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 10th. The observation team organized by teachers and students of the Department of Mathematics and Astronomy of Nanjing University saw the artificial satellite flying across the sky twice on the evenings of the 8th and 9th.

At 22:54 on the evening of the 9th, the artificial satellite appeared in the southwestern sky, moving north, passing through the constellation Cygnus and entering the constellation Draco, then disappearing.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 10th. Of the nearly one hundred people watching the artificial satellite at the Shanghai Xujiahui Observatory of the Purple Mountain Observatory of the Chinese Academy of Sciences tonight, six people saw a faintly reddish star with the naked eye, flashing by at the scheduled time the satellite was passing over Shanghai (21:10 Beijing time).

The sky over Shanghai was covered with dense clouds tonight. Before 9 o'clock, some gaps opened in the cloud layer. In a gap in the clouds in the north-northeast direction, this star flew from southwest to northeast.

    据新华社10日讯　今天早晨七时十五分到十六分之间，在北京天文馆观测人造卫星的科学工作者有两人用普通望远镜看到了一个亮点，很快从西北向东南闪过。天文馆负责人确定：这个所看到的亮点就是人造卫星，或者是输送人造卫星的火箭。
    据新华社南京10日电　南京大学数学天文系教师和学生所组织的观测队，曾经在8日和9日晚两次看到人造卫星在天空飞过。
    9日晚二十二时五十四分，人造卫星在天空西南方出现向北移动，穿过天鹅座进入天龙座，然后消失。
    新华社上海10日电　中国科学院紫金山天文台上海徐家汇观象台今晚观看人造卫星的近百人中，有六人在预定卫星经过上海的时间（北京时间二十一点十分）用肉眼看到一颗微泛红光的星体，一闪而过。
    上海天空今晚层云密布，九时前云层裂出一些缝隙，在北偏东方向的一个云豁间，这个星体从西南往东北飞过去。
