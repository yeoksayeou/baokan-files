Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 19th - Wang Guangwei, also known as Wang Changchun, one of the main culprits in the Pingdingshan Massacre of 1932, which shocked the world, was recently arrested in Taiyuan.

The criminal Wang Guangwei, also known as Wang Changchun, began serving as an informant and translator for the Japanese fascist Fushun Military Police Sub-detachment in July 1932. On September 18, 1932, the Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army attacked the Japanese invaders in the Fushun mining area to commemorate the first anniversary of the "September 18th Incident," killing more than ten Japanese invading soldiers. Wang Guangwei, devoid of national integrity, received instructions from Ogawa Ichiro, the captain of the Japanese Military Police Sub-detachment, after the incident, and twice dispatched his confidant, Mou Wenxiao, to conduct reconnaissance, but the investigation yielded no results. In order to gain the trust of the Japanese invaders, Wang Changchun fabricated intelligence and reported to the Japanese invaders that the Volunteer Army's entry into Fushun was "related to the residents of Pingdingshan." The Japanese fascists then decided to carry out a massacre of the residents of Pingdingshan. On September 22nd, Wang Changchun, under the pretext of "taking photos for remembrance," gathered more than 2,300 residents from seven villages in the Pingdingshan area on a hillside. At 7:00 PM, under the command of Ogawa Ichiro, the captain of the Japanese Military Police Sub-detachment, and Kawakami Kishi, the garrison captain, more than 200 fully armed Japanese fascist troops began a bloody slaughter of peaceful residents. Wang Changchun personally killed eighteen people. Wang Changchun's insane and criminal activities were praised by Japanese fascists such as Ogawa Ichiro, who also took a photo with Wang Changchun. After the massacre, the League of Nations, under pressure from public opinion, had no choice but to send a "League of Nations Investigation Team" headed by the Frenchman Lytton to Fushun to investigate. However, this investigation team, after receiving forged materials provided by the Japanese invaders, hurriedly left without even leaving Fushun city, causing this monstrous crime in which 2,300 compatriots were killed to remain unexposed to the world.

After liberation, Wang Changchun changed his name to Wang Guangwei, concealed his history, and infiltrated the Taiyuan Chemical Industry Second General Company as a plumbing worker. During the suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement, the Taiyuan Chemical Industry Second General Company, after a long period of investigation, finally uncovered the truth about the Pingdingshan Incident and Wang Changchun's crimes. On September 24th, the Taiyuan Municipal Public Security Bureau legally arrested this heinous counter-revolutionary element.

    “平顶山大屠杀事件”真相大白
    主要刽子手王长春落网
    新华社太原19日电  1932年震动世界的平顶山大屠杀事件主要刽子手之一的王广维，最近在太原市落网。
    罪犯王广维又名王长春，1932年7月开始充当日本法西斯抚顺宪兵分遣队密探和翻译。1932年9月18日，我东北抗日义勇军为纪念“九·一八”事变一周年，袭击抚顺矿区日寇，打死日本侵略军十多名。丧尽民族气节的王广维在事件发生后，接受日本宪兵分遣队队长小川一郎的指示，两次派亲信牟文孝进行侦察，但是调查不出结果。为了取得日寇的信任，王长春竟捏造情报，向日寇报告我义勇军进抚顺“与平顶山居民有关”。日本法西斯即决定对平顶山居民进行大屠杀。9月22日，王长春借口要“摄影留念”，将平顶山地区七个村庄的二千三百多名居民集中在一个山坡上，晚七时，在日寇宪兵分遣队长小川一郎、守备队长川上岸的指挥下，二百多名全副武装的日本法西斯军队即开始对和平居民进行血腥屠杀，王长春并亲手杀死十八人。王长春这种丧心病狂的罪恶活动曾得到日本法西斯分子小川一郎等人的表扬，并与王长春合影留念。惨案发生后，当时的国联迫于舆论，曾不得不派以法人李顿为首的“国联调查团”往抚顺调查，但是这个调查团得到日寇提供的伪造资料以后，连抚顺城都没有出就匆匆离去，致使这一有二千三百名同胞被害的滔天罪行一直没有大白于天下。
    解放以后，王长春改名王广维，隐瞒历史混入太原化学第二总公司充当水暖工人。在肃反运动中，太原化学第二总公司经过长期调查，终于弄清了平顶山事件的真相和王长春的罪恶。9月24日，太原市公安局依法逮捕了这个罪大恶极的反革命分子。
