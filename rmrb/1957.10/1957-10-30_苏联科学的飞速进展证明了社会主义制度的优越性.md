    The Rapid Progress of Soviet Science Proves the Superiority of the Socialist System
    Zhu Kezhen, Vice President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences

    The successful launch of the first artificial Earth satellite by the Soviet Union on October 4th this year has aroused jubilation and universal praise from peace-loving people all over the world. Soviet scientists have overcome the enormous gravitational pull of the Earth and opened a new era for mankind's development into the vast universe. At the same time, however, it has caused alarm and mutual recrimination among a small number of warmongers in capitalist countries, who are still trying to make a last-ditch struggle. This epoch-making achievement in Soviet science is not a sudden bolt from the blue, but an outstanding link in a series of great achievements. Since 1954, the Soviet Union has had the world's first atomic power station. Recently, the establishment of long-range routes for the new Tu-104 jet aircraft, the successful testing of intercontinental missiles, and the creation of a 10 billion electron-volt proton accelerator are all the fruits of the labor of scientific workers nurtured under the socialist system. Two years ago, Academician Nesmeyanov, President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, stated that the Soviet Union had taken the world's lead in many important scientific fields. In his interview with TASS on October 12 this year, he further explained the glorious achievements of the Soviet Union in mathematics, physics, chemistry, geology, biology, electronics, and other fields over the past forty years, which have placed Soviet science at the forefront of the struggle for human survival and happiness. He also pointed out that from the first day of the establishment of the Soviet regime, the creator of the Soviet regime, the great Lenin, took resolute steps to promote the prosperity of the country's science. As you sow, so shall you reap. The arduous efforts of the Soviet Union in science over the past forty years have now reached the time of fruition, and the splendid results will increase day by day. This can prove the unparalleled superiority of socialist society.
    In developing scientific undertakings, the Soviet Union's policies differ from those of capitalist countries, mainly in the following three aspects from my superficial point of view. First, the purposes are different. The Soviet Union develops science for the happiness of the majority of the working people, so it encourages the working people to participate in scientific work through the Stakhanov movement, labor competitions, and rationalization proposals. The purpose of capitalist countries in developing science is to increase the means for a few capitalists to accumulate capital and extract wealth. If certain scientific inventions are not profitable for capitalists, they would rather abandon them. Second, the organization and methods are different. The Soviet Union develops science in a planned way, while capitalist countries advocate free competition, with each individual researching science for the sake of science according to their interests. Third, the views on science are different. The Soviet Union values science and scientists, which is completely different from the capitalist countries that treat science as a commodity and scientists as servants. Let me give a few examples to illustrate the above three points.
    1. Regarding the purpose of developing science. After the October Revolution, the Soviet Union followed the basic principle of Marxism to develop science for the happiness of all the people. Lenin said at the Third All-Russian Soviet Congress: "In the past, all human wisdom and talent were used to create only to allow a part of the people to obtain all the achievements of technology and culture, while another part of the people could not get the most needed things - education and development. Now, all technical miracles and cultural achievements have become the property of the whole people. From now on, human wisdom and talent will never again become a means of oppression and exploitation." The possible utilization of atomic energy is the greatest discovery of mankind since the invention of fire in the Paleolithic Age. Like fire, atomic energy can kill tens of thousands of lives and destroy dotted cities, but it can also be used to emit light and heat, creating infinite happiness for mankind. However, during World War II, atomic energy was unfortunately first used by the United States to kill more than 200,000 innocent people in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan. After the war, scientists from all countries in the world almost unanimously believed that atomic weapons should be banned immediately, and everyone should devote themselves to the peaceful use of atomic energy. In 1949, the famous French scientist Zola Curie declared that he would never participate in the manufacture of atomic weapons. At that time, Curie was the chairman of the French Atomic Energy Commission, and the French government dismissed Curie from his post because he was hinted at by the warmongering group. In the same year, Bush, the director of the Scientific Research and Development Bureau during the Second World War in the United States, published a book entitled "Modern Weapons and Free People." In the book, he advocated the speedy manufacturing of atomic bombs. As for the peaceful use of atomic energy, he believed that it could only be considered in the future due to high costs. Bush served as the director of the Carnegie Foundation after the war and was the darling of American big capitalists. His remarks are very representative of the wishes of the American ruling class. After the war, regardless of cost, the Soviet Union worked hard to study the peaceful use of atomic energy and achieved remarkable results. The Soviet Union was four years behind the United States in manufacturing atomic bombs, but it was the first to build an atomic power station.
    The purpose of the Soviet Union in developing science and technology can also be seen from the electrification plan. Within a few months after the October Revolution, Lenin had already paid attention to the electrification of industry, transportation, and rural areas in formulating the scientific and technological development plan of the Academy of Sciences. He said that in order for communism to win, in order to establish a cultured life society without exploiting classes, without capitalists, landlords, and merchants, there must be electrification. After the Second World War, after two five-year plans, the Soviet Union built the huge Kuibyshev and Stalingrad hydroelectric power stations. Their total installed capacity will be 4 million kilowatts, and they can generate 20 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity annually, making the Soviet Union the second largest electricity-consuming country in the world. This will greatly help the advancement of Soviet socialist industry, and will also benefit transportation and irrigation. Although the United States is currently the country with the largest electricity consumption in the world, the large-scale development of new hydropower has been hindered by powerful capitalists and is impossible. For example, although the hydropower development of the St. Lawrence River in the northeastern United States had a plan 12 or 13 years ago, it was shelved due to the opposition of the Morgan financial group. The reason is that after the development of the St. Lawrence River Hydropower Station, the price of electricity will fall, which will be detrimental to the American Aluminum Company, DuPont Chemical Trust, General Electric Company, etc., so this plan cannot be realized even though it is supported by public opinion.
    In terms of developing nature, the Soviet Union vigorously built the Volga-Don Canal, so that a large amount of land can be irrigated; in arid areas, it built windbreaks stretching thousands of kilometers, so that flying sand can be fixed; even in the deserts and semi-deserts of Central Asia, it is also digging canals, planting forests, and fighting against drought. The scale is so large that it is only possible under the socialist system. In the past forty years, half of the country's forests in the United States have been destroyed, and the area of forests is still decreasing year by year. Many forests and grasslands in Australia have also become sandy wastelands due to indiscriminate logging and reclamation. Although some people in the United States and Australia advocate afforestation, cultivating forests has no immediate benefits, which is the least willing thing for private capitalists to do.
    2. Regarding the organization and methods of developing science. The Soviet Academy of Sciences is the command post for promoting science and technology in the Soviet Union. Before the October Revolution, the Academy of Sciences in the Tsarist era was like the British Royal Society and the French Academy of Sciences, just an honorary institution. At that time, scientific research in Russia was limited to a few universities, such as Lebedev's research in physics at Moscow University. The Tsarist government ignored scientific research and did not reward it. After the October Revolution, the Soviet Academy of Sciences underwent fundamental changes in its organization. Not only did it establish several research institutes for basic theory according to the needs of the country, but it also made plans for the development of science and technology throughout the country. At the same time, various industrial sectors and universities in the Soviet Union have successively established scientific research institutions. To date, scientific research institutions are everywhere throughout the country, and the thirteen academies of sciences of the various union republics have also become huge scientific research centers. In addition, there are also independent research institutes in medicine, agronomy, and pedagogy. Enterprise sector professional research institutes and the Soviet Academy of Sciences have established close ties in their work, so that the country's entire scientific plan can be realized.
    Over the past forty years, the Soviet Union has cultivated scientific and technological talents in a planned way. Both in terms of quantity and quality, there have been amazing achievements. According to Marxist theory, science should be an important foundation of cultural education, so in Soviet secondary schools, all subjects have been valued. In five-year universities and colleges, the teaching of all sciences is very thorough and effective. This is recognized by scientists from capitalist countries who have visited Soviet universities. In terms of quantity, the number of natural science talents cultivated in the Soviet Union is vast and far beyond what capitalist countries can achieve. According to statistics, in the forty years since the founding of the Soviet Union, the number of graduates from universities and colleges has reached 3.8 million. Although the number of university graduates in the United States during the same period is more than this number, the number of graduates in science, engineering, medicine, and agriculture in the Soviet Union has exceeded that of the United States. In 1953, the Soviet Union estimated that there were 500,000 engineers, 290,000 doctors, 170,000 agricultural technicians, and 160,000 scientific researchers. Except for engineers, the number of personnel in other fields exceeded that of the United States, but the United States only trained 22,000 engineers in 1953, while the Soviet Union had 60,000 graduates in this field. Recently, President Nesmeyanov stated that the number of personnel actively participating in scientific work in the Soviet Union is close to 4 million. This outstanding scientific team is unparalleled in the world. What is even more chilling for capitalist countries is that this team is still expanding day by day, so Allen Dulles, the head of American intelligence, said: "The most terrifying Red Army is the Soviet scientific army."
    The Soviet Union's planned training of talents can not only increase the number of scientific talents rapidly, but also achieve the effect of making the best use of their talents. After graduating from universities in capitalist countries, they are unwilling to take up positions with lower salaries, such as middle school science teachers, which has become a serious problem in both the United Kingdom and the United States. At the beginning of the founding of the Soviet Union, Lenin had already foreseen the importance of geological science for the development of the country's industry, so the large-scale cultivation of geological science talents became an important task of Soviet higher education. According to the report of Soviet geologist Academician Sherbakov this summer, before the Great Revolution, there were only 150 geological science workers in the country, but now there are as many as 20,000, not counting the more than 10,000 workers in geophysics. When the Soviet Patriotic War began in 1940, the Soviet Union's heavy industrial base was still in Ukraine, using the coal from Donetsk and the iron from Krivoy Rog as its base. By 1941, this area was occupied by Nazi Germany, and soon the transportation line of the Baku oil base was also cut off by the Nazis, but the Soviet Union was not only able to continue to resist but also quickly established the second steel base in the Urals and the second oil base between the Volga River and the Urals, so as to continuously supply military needs and make it free from shortages, and finally wiped out the Nazis. What is the reason for this? The reason is that the Soviet Union had already made preparations for the eastward shift of heavy industry during the second and third five-year plans. By 1940, the Soviet geological survey department hired more than 2,000 geologists and more than 8,000 assistants, spending 1 billion rubles a year, so that it could be prepared for any eventuality. For this reason, British biochemist Haldane wrote an article praising it, with the title "Two Thousand Geologists Saved the World."
    Recently, Soviet physicists have made brilliant achievements in atomic physics and rocket research. When drinking water, we must not forget the source, and we have to attribute it to the Soviet government's planned cultivation of physicists. According to Soviet physicist Academician Ioffe, "Before the Great Revolution, the development of Russian physics relied entirely on universities. At that time, there were only 15 physics PhDs in the country, and the total number of staff was less than 100, most of whom were busy with teaching work... The university admired its pure science loftily and cautiously avoided anything related to practice." Therefore, he said: "Although there were outstanding talents in the Russian physics community at that time, such as Lebedev, Stoletov, and Galitzine, Russian physics was the weakest link in world science." Forty years later today, the Soviet Union has thousands of physics PhDs and tens of thousands of staff, which is undoubtedly an important factor for the Soviet Union to reach the peak of world physics.
    3. Regarding the importance of science in society. Before the October Revolution, Tsarist Russia was a backward agricultural country in capitalist countries. Lenin's foresight made him realize that in order to develop the vast and boundless natural resources of the Soviet Union, it was necessary to first electrify the country's industry, transportation, and agriculture. His famous saying "Communism is Soviet power plus electrification" is well known. Since the founding of the Soviet Union, the scale of establishing scientific institutions and cultivating scientific talents has been unprecedented. As early as twenty years ago, British Professor Bernal had pointed out that the scale of Soviet science was unparalleled in the world. In 1934, the Soviet Union's scientific expenditure was 1 billion rubles, accounting for more than 1% of the Soviet Union's national income, compared with the United Kingdom and the United States, the relative figure was ten times that of the United Kingdom and three times that of the United States. According to the report of the Central Committee of the CPSU to the 19th National Congress, in the five years from 1951 to 1956, the expenditure of the Soviet Academy of Sciences was 47.2 billion rubles, accounting for 2.2% of the national revenue. Recently, Academician Nesmeyanov told a TASS reporter: "Over the past forty years, the number of staff of the Soviet Academy of Sciences has increased a hundredfold, and the budget has almost increased a thousandfold." This all shows how much the Soviet government values scientific undertakings.
    In the Soviet Union, the importance of scientific undertakings is not limited to funding, but also makes every effort in publicity, so that the general public can understand the importance of scientific undertakings. New discoveries by scientific research institutes, over-quota production by factory workers, and the special achievements of agricultural labor models have all become headline news in newspapers. This is very different from the capitalist countries' newspapers that like to publish personal trivia about movie stars and baseball players, as well as kidnapping, robbery, and murder cases. The status of academicians of the Soviet Academy of Sciences and university professors is also extremely high, which cannot be compared with the capitalist countries in the United Kingdom and the United States, which only value millionaires.
    In his recent book "Science and the Red Army," British biologist Sir Ashworth mentioned how he witnessed the commemoration of a famous scientist in the Soviet Union ten years ago. May 15, 1945, was the 100th anniversary of the birth of Soviet biologist Mechnikov. Early in the morning of that day, all newspapers in the Soviet Union published the life story of Mechnikov, radio stations broadcast his scientific achievements, a newly made commemorative plaque was hung on his former residence, film companies made films about his life and showed them everywhere, and the Biological Society also made two gold medals for him. After such publicity, by that evening, all primary and secondary school students in the Soviet Union knew Mechnikov. Ashworth said with emotion: "The Soviet Union uses such social pressure to drive outstanding young people to study science and technology." And we should say that using such guiding forces to promote outstanding young people to study science and technology or literature, art, and philosophy, instead of rewarding the younger generation to become selfish millionaires, is precisely where socialist society is superior to capitalism.
    For comparison, it is also worth mentioning the views of people in capitalist countries towards scientists. At the end of August this year, the American magazine Science published an article entitled "The Scientist Imagined in the Minds of Middle School Students." This article is a comprehensive conclusion made by the American Association for the Advancement of Science soliciting answers from 35,000 middle school students in 120 American middle schools through correspondence. From the perspective of American middle school students, a scientist has the following advantages: he is talented, patient, not corrupted by wealth, unyielding in poverty, can work all day and night, fighting for the truth, he is very careful in his work, does not draw conclusions in a subjective way, he can make people extend their lives and increase happiness. However, a scientist also has the following shortcomings: he only has reason but no emotion, spends all day in the laboratory pouring things from one glass tube to another, and can spend years or decades without getting results, his salary is low and he is not valued; if he wants to build his own laboratory, he lacks funds, and if he is employed by a company, he has to listen to his boss, and if he makes an invention, all the benefits go to the capitalists. If he works for the government, he is subject to confidentiality restrictions, and if he is not careful, he is suspected of being a spy; he does not care about his children and lover at home, and always talks about his profession, making people tired of listening. If he has any insights, he cannot discuss them with his wife in order to keep them secret. From this answer, it seems that the American government's distrust of scientific workers and the society's contempt for scientific work have become a common phenomenon, and even middle school students rarely want to be a scientific worker for life.
    The capitalist countries of Britain and the United States have always maliciously slandered the Soviet Union, saying that the Soviet Union persecuted scientists with liberal tendencies. The most widely publicized is the "persecution" of geneticist Nikolai Vavilov and physicist Peter Kapitsa. According to British and American newspapers, Vavilov has been shot countless times, which are all nonsense. Not long ago, the Soviet Academy of Sciences published his complete works, and Nesmeyanov praised him as one of the Soviet Union's outstanding scientists. British and American newspapers have long rumored that Kapitsa has disappeared, but in fact, he is in charge of an institute of the Soviet Academy of Sciences and is working diligently. After the successful launch of the first artificial Earth satellite in the Soviet Union, he also said in a statement: "This success cannot be attributed to a certain scientist or a certain science, but to the superiority of the Soviet scientific organization."
    After World War II, the rampant persecution of American scientists by McCarthyism in the United States was a fact that everyone witnessed. Robert Oppenheimer, a brilliant nuclear physicist, was squeezed out by the leaders who controlled scientific research funds because he publicly declared that he was unwilling to participate in the research of thermonuclear weapons, so that he could not give full play to his strengths. Edward Condon, the former director of the National Bureau of Standards of the United States, was dismissed from his post for refusing to issue a visa for a fake battery revitalizer, which offended the anger of financial giants. Although he was reinstated for a time after a general strike by all employees in the bureau, he was soon forced to resign, and even faced various difficulties in seeking a suitable position. From the perspective of McCarthyists, people like Oppenheimer and Condon are fellow travelers of communists, so they are regarded as thorns in their side and must be eliminated. Recently, the Chicago Sun-Times asked Nobel Prize winner Dr. Harold Urey for advice on the question of why the United States' manufacturing of artificial Earth satellites is behind the Soviet Union. His answer was: The American government's pride and complacency, the persecution of scientists, have caused many first-class scientists to give up this work, and free competition has made the United States' manufacturing of satellites behind the Soviet Union. The first-class scientists referred to by Urey are Oppenheimer and Condon.
    The innate intelligence level of all ethnic groups in the world is on par. As long as there is a good political system, appropriate talents, and social attention, whether it is science, literature, philosophy, or art, it will flourish and prosper. The Soviet Union has a superior socialist system and has 4 million scientific workers who are enthusiastic about serving the working people and are valued and expected by society. Its scientific prosperity and progress will inevitably be like the rising sun in the morning, advancing from one victory to another. All people who love light, justice, and peace are looking forward to it.

    苏联科学的飞速进展证明了社会主义制度的优越性
    中国科学院副院长　竺可桢
    今年10月4日苏联发射第一个人造地球卫星的成功，引起了全世界爱好和平人士的欢欣鼓舞，普遍赞美。苏联科学家战胜了巨大的地心吸力，开辟了人类向大宇宙发展的新纪元。但同时却也使资本主义国家里的少数好战分子惊惶失措，相互埋怨，犹图作最后的挣扎。苏联科学上的这一划时代的成就，并不是像晴天霹雳般的突如其来的，而是一系列巨大成就当中的一个突出的环节。从1954年起，苏联就有了世界上第一个原子能发电站，最近图—104新型喷气式飞机远程航线的建立，洲际导弹试验的成功，一百亿电子伏特的质子加速器的制成，这些成就都是在社会主义制度下孕育出来的科学工作者的劳动成果。两年前苏联科学院院长涅斯米扬诺夫院士曾声明说，苏联在许多重要的科学方面已占居世界的首位；在今年10月12日他对塔斯社发表的谈话中，又说明了苏联四十年来在数学、物理学、化学、地质学、生物学、电子学等各方面的辉煌成就，已使苏联的科学站在争取人类生存和幸福斗争中的最前线。他并指出，从苏维埃政权成立的第一天起，苏维埃政权的缔造者、伟大的列宁就采取了繁荣祖国科学的坚决步骤。种瓜得瓜、种豆得豆，四十年来苏联在科学方面的艰苦奋斗，到现在已是瓜熟豆黄的时候了，灿烂的成果将与日俱增，这正可证明社会主义社会的无比优越性。
    在发展科学事业方面，苏联的政策与资本主义国家所不同者，从个人粗浅的看法主要表现在下列三个方面。第一，目的不同。苏联发展科学的目的是为了大多数劳动人民的幸福，所以奖励劳动人民经过斯达哈诺夫运动、劳动竞赛、合理化建议等来参加科学工作。而资本主义国家发展科学的目的，则是为了增进少数资本家积累资本榨取财富的手段而已，若干科学发明若对资本家无利可图，则宁愿弃置不用。第二，组织与方法不同。苏联有计划地发展科学，资本主义国家则主张自由竞争，各人依其兴趣为科学而研究科学。第三，对科学的看法不同。苏联重视科学和科学家，这与资本主义国家把科学当商品、科学家当奴仆完全不同。试举几个实例来说明以上三点。
    一、关于发展科学的目的。十月革命后，苏联遵循了马克思主义为全民的幸福来发展科学的基本原理。列宁在全俄第三次苏维埃代表大会上曾说过：“从前全部人类的智慧和才能进行创造只是为了让一部分人获得全部技术和文化的成果，而使另一部分人得不到最需要的东西——受教育和发展。而在现在，一切技术奇迹和文化成果都变成全民的财产，从现在起人类的智慧和天才永远不再会成为压迫和剥削的手段了”。原子能的可能被利用是人类从旧石器时代发明火以后的最大发现。原子能和火同样可以屠杀成千累万的生灵，毁灭星罗棋布的城市，但同时也能用来发光发热，为人类创造无限的幸福。但在第二次大战期间，原子能却不幸首先被美国用来杀死日本广岛、长崎两地二十多万无辜的人民。大战后世界各国科学家几乎一致地认为原子武器应立即禁止，大家应致力于原子能的和平利用。1949年法国著名科学家左拉·居里声明决不参加制造原子武器的工作，当时居里为法国原子能委员会主席，法国政府因受了好战集团的暗示而免除了居里的职务。同年，美国第二次大战期间科学研究发展局的局长勃雪出版了一本名为“近代武器与自由人”的书，他在书中主张尽速制造原子弹，至于原子能的和平利用，他认为由于成本过高只可留待将来考虑。勃雪在大战后任卡纳奇基金会主任委员，是美国大资本家的宠儿，他的言论是很可代表美国统治阶级的意愿的。苏联战后不管成本如何，努力研究原子能的和平利用问题，成效卓著。苏联在制造原子弹上要落后于美国四年之久，而建立原子能发电站却是首屈一指的。
    苏联发展科学技术的目的也可以从电气化的计划里看出来。十月革命后不到几个月，列宁在制定科学院科学技术发展规划里即已注意到工业、交通和农村的电气化。他说要使共产主义胜利，要使没有剥削阶级、没有资本家、地主、商人阶级的有文化生活的社会能建立起来，必须有电气化。第二次大战后经过两个五年计划，苏联把巨大无比的古比雪夫、斯大林格勒的水电站建立起来了。它们的总装机容量将为四百万瓩，每年可发电二百亿度，使苏联一跃而为世界第二个用电最多的国家。这将给与苏联社会主义工业的推进以极大的帮助，同时对交通运输灌溉均有所裨益。美国虽是目前世界用电最多的国家，但要再大规模的开发新的水电已受到有势力的大资本家的掣肘而不可能。如美国东北圣罗棱斯河的水电开发虽在十二、三年前已有了计划，但因受到莫尔根财阀集团的反对而搁置起来。原因是圣罗棱斯河水电站开发以后，将使电力跌价，与美国制铝公司、杜邦化学托辣斯、奇异电气公司等均有所不利，所以这一计划虽为大众舆论所赞同也无法实现。
    在开发自然方面，苏联大力地建筑伏尔加—顿河运河，使大量土地可以得到灌溉；在干旱地区建造防风林，连绵数千公里，使飞沙可以固定；虽在中央亚细亚荒漠、半荒漠地区，也在开凿运河，种植森林，与干旱作斗争，其规模之大，只有在社会主义制度下才有可能。美国在过去四十年中，全国森林的半数已被破坏，目前每年森林的面积还在日益减少中。澳洲的许多森林草地也因为滥伐滥垦而流为沙荒。在美国、澳洲虽也有人提倡植林，但是培植森林无眼前利益可图，是私人资本家所最不乐意做的一桩事。
    二、关于发展科学的组织与方法。苏联科学院是苏联推进科学技术的司令台。在十月大革命以前帝俄时代的科学院和英国皇家学会、法国科学院一样，只是一个名誉机关。那时俄国的科学研究只限于几个大学里，如莫斯科大学的列别极夫在物理学方面的研究工作即其一例。帝俄政府漠视科学研究而不加奖励。十月大革命以后，苏联科学院在组织方面有了根本的改变，不但视国家的需要设立了若干研究基本理论的研究所，而且做出了发展全国科学技术的计划。同时苏联各产业部门和各大学均陆续地增设了科学研究机构。迄今科学研究机构全国到处林立，各加盟共和国的十三个科学院也已经变成了巨大的科学研究中心。此外在医学、农学、教育学等方面，亦均有其独立的研究院。企业部门专业研究院和苏联科学院在工作上均取得紧密的联系，使国家整个科学计划得以实现。
    四十年来苏联有计划地培养科学技术人才，无论在量与质方面，统有惊人的成绩。依据马克思主义的理论，科学应是文化教育的一个重要基础，所以在苏联的中等学校里，各门学科均已受到重视，在五年制的大学和高等学校里，各门科学的教学均十分透彻而有效，这是参观过苏联大学的资本主义国家的科学家所公认的。在数量方面，苏联所培养的自然科学人才浩浩荡荡，远非资本主义国家所可企及。据统计，苏联开国以来四十年中，高等学校毕业生人数达三百八十万人，而同时期美国大学毕业生虽多于此数，但理、工、医、农各科的毕业生，苏联反而超过美国。1953年苏联估计有工程师五十万人，医生二十九万人，农业技术人员十七万人，科学研究人员十六万人。其中除工程师外，其余人员均超过美国，但美国在1953年只造就了工程师二万二千人，而苏联在这方面的毕业生却有六万人。最近涅斯米扬诺夫院长声称，在苏联积极参加科学工作的人员已接近四百万人。这一支杰出的科学队伍是世界无匹的。而资本主义国家尤为寒心者，乃是这一支队伍尚在日益扩大中，所以美国情报工作的首脑艾伦·杜勒斯曾说：“最可怕的红军是苏联的科学大军”。
    苏联有计划地培养人才不但可使科学人才迅速增加，而且可收人尽其才的效果。资本主义国家大学生毕业后，对薪俸较薄的职业，如中学理科教师等职务，均不愿担任，这在英国和美国都成为严重的问题。苏联建国之初，列宁即已预见到地质科学对于发展国家工业的重要性，因此大量培植地质科学人才便成为苏联高等教育的重要任务。据今夏苏联地质学家雪尔培考夫院士的报告，在大革命以前，全国只有地质科学工作人员一百五十人，到目前已达两万人之多，地球物理方面的一万多工作人员尚不计算在内。在1940年苏联卫国战争开始时，苏联的重工业基地还在乌克兰，用顿涅茨的煤和克里伏的铁作为基地。到1941年，这个区域即为德国纳粹所占领，不久石油基地巴库的运输线亦为纳粹所切断，但苏联不但能继续抵抗而且迅速地建立起第二个钢铁基地于乌拉尔，第二个石油基地于伏尔加河与乌拉尔间，以源源的供给军事上的需要，而使之不虞匮乏，终于把纳粹消灭。这是什么缘故呢？原因即在苏联早在第二、三个五年计划期间，已做好了重工业东移的准备，到1940年苏联地质勘察部门聘请了二千多个地质学家和八千多个助手，年花十亿卢布经费，这样才能有备而无患。为此英国生物化学家海尔登曾著文赞扬，他的题目是“二千个地质学家救了全世界”。
    最近苏联物理学家在原子物理和火箭研究方面获得了辉煌的成就，饮水思源也不得不归功于苏联政府有计划地培植物理学家。据苏联物理学家约夫院士说：“大革命以前俄国物理科学的发展全靠大学。当时全国只有十五个物理学博士，所有工作人员总数不到一百人，其中大多数忙于教学工作，……大学孤高地欣赏他的纯粹科学，谨慎地避免与实践有关”。所以他说：“那时俄国物理学界虽有杰出的人才如列比杰夫、司托列托夫和加利青，但是俄国的物理学是世界科学最弱的一环”。到了四十年以后的今天，苏联已有成千的物理学博士和成万的工作人员，这无疑是苏联走向世界物理学高峰的重要因素。
    三、关于科学在社会中的重要性。在十月大革命以前，在资本主义国家中帝俄是一个落后的农业国家。列宁的高瞻远瞩使他了解到要开发广大无边的苏联的自然资源，必须首先使全国的工业、交通和农业电气化。他的名言“共产主义就是苏维埃政权加上电气化”，这是尽人皆知的。苏联从建国以来，对于建立科学机构培养科学人才的规模之大，是史无前例的。早在二十年以前，英国巴纳尔教授即已指出苏联科学规模之大世无伦比。在1934年苏联科学经费为十亿卢布，为苏联国家收入的1％强，与英美相比，则相对数字十倍于英国而三倍于美国。据苏共中央向第十九次代表大会的报告，在1951—1956五年中，苏联科学院经费共为四百七十二亿卢布，占国家岁入的2.2％。最近涅斯米扬诺夫院士告塔斯社记者说：“四十年来苏联科学院的工作人员数目增加到一百倍，预算几乎增加到一千倍”。这统是表征着苏联政府如何重视科学事业。
    在苏联，科学事业之被重视并不只限于经费方面，在宣传方面也不遗余力，使一般社会人士均了解到科学事业之重要。各科学研究所的新发现、工厂工人的超额增产、农业劳模的特殊功绩，统成为报纸上的头号新闻。这与资本主义国家报纸的喜登电影明星、棒球大将的私人琐事以及绑票强盗凶杀事件者迥不相同。苏联科学院院士以及大学教授的地位亦极崇高，非英美资本主义国家只重视百万富翁之可比拟。
    英国生物学家阿庶培爵士在他近著“科学与红军”一文中，曾提到十年前他在苏联目睹如何纪念一位科学名人的事。1945年5月15日是苏联生物学家马钦尼可夫的诞生百周年纪念。是日一大早，苏联全国各报统登有马钦尼可夫的生平事略，各广播电台广播他的科学成就，他的故居挂起了新制的纪念牌，影片公司为他的生平摄制影片到处放映，生物学会为他还做了二个金质奖章。这样宣传到了当天晚上，苏联全国中小学生无一不知马钦尼可夫其人。阿庶培感慨地说：“苏联就是用这样的社会压力来驱使优秀青年去学科学和技术”。而我们应该说，用这样的指导力量来促使优秀青年去学习科学技术或是文艺哲学，而不奖励青年一代的人去做损人利己的百万富翁，正是社会主义社会比资本主义优越的地方。
    为了对照起见，资本主义国家社会里人们对于科学家的看法也值得一提。今年8月底美国科学周刊登了一篇文章，题为“中学生脑筋中所想像的科学家”。这篇文章是美国科学促进会用通讯方式向一百二十个美国中等学校三万五千个中学生征求来的答案所作出来的综合结论。从美国的中学生看来，一位科学家有下列的优点：他有天才，有忍耐心，富贵不能淫，贫贱不可移，可以废寝忘食整天工作着，为真理而奋斗，他做工作非常细心，不以主观的方法得出结论，他可以使人生延长寿命，增加幸福。但一位科学家同时也有下列缺点：他只具有理智而没有感情，整天在实验室里把这一玻璃管的东西倒到另一玻璃管，可以花费几年、几十年工夫而得不出结果，薪水既低也不受人重视；要想自己建实验室缺乏经费，受雇于公司要听命于老板，有所发明，利益统归资本家，若为政府工作就受保密的限制，一不当心有被当作奸细的嫌疑；他在家对于子女爱人毫不关心，开口不离本行，使人听了厌倦，偶有心得而为了保密也不能和妻子商谈。从这个答案里看来，美国政府的不信任科学工作人员和社会轻视科学工作，已成普遍现象，甚至连中学的男女学生亦很少愿以做一个科学工作人员为终身职业。
    英美资本主义国家素来恶意诋毁苏联，说苏联迫害有自由主义倾向的科学家，宣传得最为广泛的是对遗传学家尼古拉·怀维洛夫和物理学家彼得·甲比车的“迫害”。怀维洛夫据英美报纸传说已不知被枪毙了多少次，这些尽是无稽之谈。不久以前苏联科学院已把他的全集出版，涅斯米扬诺夫并赞扬他为苏联杰出的科学家之一。甲比车英美报纸早已传说失纵了，但实际上他却在主持苏联科学院的一个研究所，并辛勤的工作着。在苏联第一个人造地球卫星成功地发射以后，他还发表谈话说：“这一成功并不能归功于某一个科学家或某一门科学，而要归功于苏联科学组织的优越性。”
    在第二次大战以后，美国麦卡锡主义迫害美国科学家的猖獗倒是有目共睹的事实。罗伯特·奥本海迈是杰出的核子物理学家，因为他公开地宣称不愿参加热核子武器的研究工作，因此而遭到掌握科学研究基金的把头们的排挤，使他不能发挥其所长。前美国度量衡局局长爱德华·康唐在其任内时，因为拒绝为冒牌骗人的电池复活剂出签证，触犯了金融巨头之怒而被免职，以后虽经局中全体职工的总罢工而一度复职，但不久即被迫辞职，甚至欲觅一适当职务而遭到种种困难。从麦卡锡主义者看来，像奥本海迈和康唐这类人物，是共产主义者的同路人，所以被视为眼中钉，必须排除之方以为快。最近芝加哥太阳时报为了美国制造人造地球卫星落后于苏联而提出问题就教于诺贝尔奖金获得者哈罗德·尤雷博士，他的回答是：美国政府的骄傲自满，对于科学家的迫害，使许多第一流科学家放弃了这一工作，以及自由竞争使得美国制造卫星落后于苏联。尤雷所指的第一流科学家就是奥本海迈和康唐等。
    世界上各民族天生的智慧水平是不相上下的。只要有优良的政治制度、适当的人才加以社会的重视，无论科学、文学、哲学、艺术，统会欣欣向荣，蒸蒸日上。苏联具有优越的社会主义制度，拥有四百万热情为劳动人民服务、受到社会的重视和期待的科学工作人员，它的科学的繁荣迈进，必然是如清晨的旭日必会东升一样，从一个胜利迈向又一个胜利，凡是爱好光明、正义和和平的人民没有不引颈以望的。
