	Thriving Belarus

	Spring always brings happiness and hope. But before the revolution, spring in Belarus brought great disasters. Every spring, the swamps in the low-lying forest areas would flood into vast seas. Sparsely populated villages on higher ground were like isolated islands in the ocean. In the era of Soviet power, the people became masters of the swamps, draining millions of hectares of swamps and turning them into fertile fields. More than a quarter of Belarus's land is covered by forests, 75% of which used to belong to landlords and the royal family, who over-exploited them in pursuit of profits. In the era of Soviet power, hundreds of thousands of hectares of forests have been restored. Industries such as timber, woodworking, as well as match industry and paper industry of all-Union significance have been established.

	Currently, the industrial products produced by the Belarusian Republic in sixteen days are equivalent to the total annual output of Belarus before the October Revolution. Last year, Belarus's industrial production had increased to 22 times that before the revolution, electricity generation increased 111 times compared to 1913, and peat 225 times. Before 1917, Belarus had no automobile industry at all. Now, its production of trucks exceeds the total of Austria, Denmark, and Ireland combined. The famous heavy-duty truck capable of carrying 40 tons is produced in Belarus.

	Belarus ranks second in the Soviet Union in terms of flax planting area. Its production of long-fiber flax ranks first in the Soviet Union. Potatoes and hemp also rank third in the Soviet Union. Milk and milk products rank fourth. Currently, agricultural workers in the Republic are striving to achieve a yield of 100 quintals of meat and 420 quintals of milk per 100 hectares of agricultural land by 1960.

	Belarus, where 82% of the population was illiterate before the revolution, has not only eliminated illiteracy long ago, but also has more than 50,000 university students and 23 institutions of higher education. In terms of the number of students per 10,000 residents, it has surpassed the United Kingdom and France.

	But the advancing people of Belarus will never forget the great price they paid to win today's happiness!

	The great October Revolution brought happiness and light to the suffering people of Belarus. The people of Belarus quickly leaped from a backward region to become an advanced industrial and agricultural republic. However, the fascist invasion interrupted the construction work of this republic, located on the western border of the Soviet Union, and brought it extremely serious losses—more than half of the country's wealth was lost, one-fifth of the country's land was turned into ruins, and the capital, Minsk, was almost razed to the ground by the Hitler bandits. But the heroic people of Belarus, with the help of the Soviet government and their fraternal nationalities, restored industry and agriculture to not only pre-war levels, but also surpassed them, in just a few years. Sectors such as tractor manufacturing and automobile manufacturing were newly built after the war. Minsk has been built into the most beautiful big city in the Republic.

    欣欣向荣的白俄罗斯
    春天总是带给人们幸福和希望。可是革命前白俄罗斯的春天，带给人们的却是巨大的灾难。每逢春季，低洼森林地带的沼泽就泛滥成一片汪洋大海。稀稀疏疏的高地上的村庄就好像海洋中的孤岛。苏维埃政权时代，人民做了沼泽的主人，疏干了成百万公顷的沼泽，使它们变成了良田。占白俄罗斯土地四分之一以上的森林富源，过去75％属于地主和皇室，为了追求利润，他们滥加砍伐。苏维埃政权时代已经恢复了数十万公顷的森林。木材、木器制造业、以及具有全苏联意义的火柴工业和造纸工业等部门都建立起来了。
    目前白俄罗斯共和国在十六天内所生产的工业品就相当于十月革命前白俄罗斯的全年产量。去年白俄罗斯的工业生产已经增加为革命前的二十二倍，发电量比1913年增加了一百一十一倍，泥炭二百二十五倍。1917年以前，白俄罗斯根本没有汽车工业。现在它生产的载重汽车已超过了奥地利、丹麦和爱尔兰三国的总和。著名的能载重四十吨的大卡车，就是白俄罗斯生产的。
    白俄罗斯的亚麻播种面积占全苏联第二位。它出产的长纤维亚麻居苏联第一位。马铃薯和大麻也已占全苏联第三位。牛奶和牛奶产品占第四位。目前共和国的农业劳动者正努力争取在1960年使每一百公顷农业用地的产量达到一百公担肉类，四百二十公担牛奶。
    革命前82％是文盲的白俄罗斯，不仅早已消灭了文盲，而且仅大学生就有五万多名，二十三所高等学校，按每一万居民中的学生数目来说，已经超过了英国和法国。
    但是前进中的白俄罗斯人民永远也不会忘记，他们为了争取幸福的今天，曾经付出了多么大的代价！
    伟大的十月革命给苦难重重的白俄罗斯人民带来了幸福和光明。白俄罗斯人民迅速地从落后地区跃进成为一个先进的工农业共和国。可是法西斯的进攻使这个位于苏联西部边境的共和国中断了建设工作，给它带来了极严重的损失——损失了全国一半以上的财富，全国五分之一的土地变成了废墟，首都明斯克被希特勒强盗几乎夷为平地。可是英雄的白俄罗斯人民在苏联政府和各族兄弟的援助下，在短短的几年内使工农业不仅恢复到战前水平，并超过了它。如拖拉机制造业和汽车制造业等部门，都是战后新建起来的。明斯克已经建设成共和国最美丽的大城市了。（凌海）（附图片）
