Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 30th – With the rapid advancement of farmland irrigation, China's irrigation management work has powerfully guaranteed the development of agricultural production. This was learned by the reporter from the 1957 National Irrigation Management Work Conference, which recently concluded in Xi'an. This conference, jointly convened by the Ministry of Water Resources and the Ministry of Agriculture, was held to fully leverage irrigation benefits, increase yield per unit area, and welcome the upcoming upsurge in agricultural production.

The data obtained from the conference show that, out of the nation's sixteen hundred million mu of cultivated land, five hundred and twenty million mu have irrigation facilities, double the amount in 1949. At the same time, with the realization of agricultural cooperativization, fundamental changes have also taken place in irrigation management. Currently, the irrigation project facilities in many irrigation districts have basically changed the old and backward look of the past through improved management; corresponding irrigation management organizations at all levels have been established and improved, and a strong irrigation management team composed of water conservancy and agricultural personnel has been cultivated. On irrigated land where new irrigation techniques have been implemented, rice yields have increased by an average of about 10%, and dry crops have increased by 20% to 30%, while in general, the crop yields of newly irrigated dry land can increase by 50% to more than double.

In recent years, due to the high production enthusiasm of the peasant masses and the superior conditions of cooperativization, many new irrigation technologies have been widely promoted. At present, the area where winter and spring irrigation is implemented in the northern dry farming areas has reached more than 55 million mu, and the area with better furrow irrigation and border irrigation is also nearly 50 million mu. The area where rice is implemented with the principle of "frequent light irrigation and reasonable irrigation and drainage" has reached more than 72 million mu. Since 1954, China has learned from the Soviet Union's advanced experience of "planned water use," which has enabled 12 million mu of irrigated area to achieve the effect of saving water and increasing production under scientific planning management.

After discussion, the conference tentatively decided that in 1958, the nation's existing irrigation facilities, through strengthened management and tapping potential, would expand the irrigated area by eight million mu; promote furrow irrigation and border irrigation for dry farming and reasonable frequent light irrigation for rice to reach 190 million mu; and promote planned water use for more than 20 million mu. The conference summarized the work experience of the past few years, and believes that first and foremost, it is necessary to strengthen the organizational leadership of irrigation management. State-owned irrigation districts and cooperative-operated joint irrigation districts should also establish management organizations or dedicated management personnel. The conference analyzed that 90% of the irrigated area is currently operated by agricultural cooperatives, so it is necessary to fully rely on the masses to do a good job in management. The conference pointed out that it is necessary to summarize and promote the water use experience of the masses, and cadres should go deep into the fields to listen to the opinions of the masses. Strengthen close cooperation between irrigation and agricultural work and strengthen irrigation management. Only by doing both construction and management well can we ensure that farmland water conservancy projects are built well, managed well, and used well.

The conference lasted for nine days, and was attended by more than 140 people, including agricultural and water conservancy cadres, scientific research personnel, teaching staff, and experts from across the country and various provinces.

    发挥灌溉效益  迎接生产高潮
    全国灌溉管理工作会议决定继续挖掘灌溉潜力
    新华社西安30日电  随着农田灌溉事业的突飞猛进，我国灌溉管理工作有力地保证了农业生产的发展。这是记者从最近在西安闭幕的1957年全国灌溉管理工作会议上获悉的。这个由水利部、农业部联合召开的会议是为了充分发挥灌溉效益，提高单位产量，迎接即将到来的农业生产高潮而举行的。
    从会议所获得的资料表明，在全国十六亿亩耕地中，有灌溉设施的已达五亿二千万亩，为1949年的两倍。同时，随着农业合作化的实现，在灌溉管理工作上也起了根本性的变化。目前许多灌区的灌溉工程设施，通过管理改善已基本上改变了过去破旧和落后的面貌；并相应地建立和健全了各级灌溉管理机构，培养了一支水利农业等人员组成的强大的灌溉管理队伍。在推行新的灌溉技术的灌溉土地上，水稻产量平均提高了10％左右，旱作物提高了20％到30％，而一般新灌溉区旱地经灌溉后，农作物产量更能提高50％到一倍以上。
    几年来由于农民群众生产情绪高涨，合作化的优越条件，因此许多新的灌水技术获得广泛推行。现在北方旱作地区推行冬春灌的面积已达五千五百多万亩，沟灌、畦灌量较好的面积也近五千万亩。水稻实行勤浇浅灌合理灌排的面积已达七千二百多万亩。从1954年起，我国学习了苏联先进的“计划用水”经验，已经使一千二百万亩的灌溉面积在科学的计划管理下，收到省水增产的作用。
    会议经过讨论初步决定：1958年，全国原有灌溉设施，通过加强管理，挖掘潜力扩大灌溉面积八百万亩；推行旱作的沟灌、畦灌和水稻的合理勤浇浅灌达到一亿九千万亩；推行计划用水二千多万亩。会议总结了几年来的工作经验，认为首先应该加强灌溉管理的组织领导。国营灌区和合作社联营灌区也应设立管理组织或专管人员。会议分析目前有90％的灌溉面积为农业社经营，因此必须充分依靠群众做好管理工作。会议指出要总结推广群众的用水经验，干部要深入田间，听取群众意见。加强灌溉与农业工作的密切合作，加强灌溉管理工作。只有把兴修和管理工作同时做好，才能保证农田水利工程做到修好一处，管好一处和用好一处。
    这次会议一共开了九天，参加人员有全国和各省的农业、水利工作干部，科学研究人员和教学人员及专家等共一百四十多人。
