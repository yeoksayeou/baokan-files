Don't Be Afraid of "Fire"
　　Zhuang Nong
"This movement's sharp edge is definitely aimed at me. There are two possibilities: one is being burned away; the other is that true gold fears no fire." This is the view of a factory director regarding the rectification campaign.

It seems this factory director has a fear of "fire." Because while he still has the hope that "true gold fears no fire," he also has concerns about being "burned away."

I believe this concern of being "burned away" is a kind of "杞人忧天" [groundless fear].

There are two kinds of "fire." One kind of "fire" is the evil "fire" set by right-wing elements. This fire is aimed at each of us. However, we have not been "burned away." This at least proves that although we are not made of pure gold, we have more true gold in us, and after being burned in this way, the proportion of true gold in us is even greater. Those who have been "burned" away are those who contain too little gold or no gold at all. The other kind of "fire" is the revolutionary "fire" unleashed by the people, which is a sacred "fire." This fire is also aimed at each of us (not just him alone), but this is a good thing, because it further proves that we are indeed revolutionaries. I believe that those who are not afraid of the first kind of fire have even less reason to fear the second kind of "fire"; those who cannot be burned away in the first kind of "fire" will be even less likely to be burned away in the second kind of "fire." Can we really believe that people who have personally witnessed us undergo trials in the anti-rightist struggle, proving that we are loyal to the cause of socialism, would turn around and use fire to "burn us away"? What is likely to be burned away is still the kind of person who contains too little gold, or no gold at all. Although this kind of person has gold pasted on their face, inside they are full of impurities; although they can dodge the first kind of "fire," they cannot dodge the second kind of fire. Isn't this exactly what we hope for?

This factory director may feel that his own shortcomings are too serious, and therefore feels that there is a possibility of being "burned away," but in my opinion, he will not be burned away, because he still feels that he has "true gold" after all. As long as he is not afraid of criticism, does not reject criticism, and feels that his shortcomings are serious, it will instead become conducive to correcting shortcomings.

In fact, most of our people contain both true gold and impurities. This is not surprising. Before true gold is refined, it is always combined with impurities. There is no true gold in the world that has not been refined, and there are no perfect revolutionaries born. Great revolutionary leaders are also made through conscious refining. As long as true gold does not dissolve with impurities into an inseparable substance, it can eventually become true gold; as long as we dare to correct our shortcomings, we can eventually become good revolutionaries. We should have confidence in the true gold in us, so we don't need to be afraid of "fire." After being refined by the second kind of fire, we will become pure gold that shines brightly, what could be bad about that? However, this requires the courage to leap into this great furnace, and to strive to get rid of the impurities on our bodies.

Fear of "fire" is itself a corrosive agent for gold. Because of fear, one will strive to avoid it, resist it, and eventually cause the gold to deteriorate. Then there is a real danger of being "burned away." Yue Shuliang, the comrade in Tianjin who was suspended from his post for reflection, was close to this danger.

People who have lived in the north for a long time (I don't know about the south) all know a custom in the countryside during the New Year in the past. In Hebei Province it is called "Liao Cao" [burning grass]. On New Year's Eve, at dusk, every family lights a pile of sweet grass in front of their door (some also put on cypress branches), while setting off firecrackers. At this time, everyone surrounds the fire, extending their hands to the fire. Young people and children also have to jump over the fire. It is said that people who have been roasted by this fire can get rid of the diseases on their bodies, and people without diseases will be free from all diseases. It is even better for those who can jump over it. In the countryside of northern Shaanxi, there is also this custom on New Year's Eve. However, probably because there are more mountains and less land there, they are reluctant to burn sweet grass, but instead cut dead branches from the mountains to burn. The crackling and burning flames really give people a feeling of holiness. At this time, people who can jump all come to jump. This is called "Liao Bai Bing" [burning away all diseases]. I was once pulled to jump once. I said I didn't believe this could "burn away all diseases." But they said, "Regardless of whether you believe it or not, jumping won't hurt you." So, I jumped over.

I think we can regard the "fire" of the rectification campaign as the kind of fire that "burns away all diseases." Everyone should come and jump. Although the farmers' approach has some superstitious colors, the spirit and intention of regarding fire as sacred and bravely jumping into the fire to get rid of diseases is still worth learning. Of course, jumping into the fire of rectification will not be as light and quick as jumping into that kind of fire, and there may even be the pain of burning the skin and a feeling of torment; but compared to that kind of fire, it is truly effective in "burning away diseases."

Have you ever seen true gold that can remove impurities and become true gold without being refined by fire? Let us jump into this fire with a smile. Without the determination to jump into the fire, it is impossible to drastically improve work and correct shortcomings.

### 不要怕“火”

　　不要怕“火”
　　庄农
    “这次运动的锋芒非对我不可。有两个可能：一个是烧化了；一个是真金不怕火炼。”这是一个工厂的厂长对整风的看法。
    看来这位厂长有怕“火”的情绪。因为他虽然还有“真金不怕火炼”的希望，但也同时有被“烧化了”的顾虑。
    我以为这种“烧化了”的顾虑是一种“杞人忧天”。
    “火”是有两种的。一种“火”是右派分子放的邪恶的“火”。这把火是对准了我们每个人的。然而我们并没有被“烧化了”。这起码已经证明，我们虽非纯金铸造，但我们身上多的还是真金，而且经这么一烧，真金在我们身上的比重就更大了。被“烧”化了的却是那些含金太少或不含金的人。另一种“火”是人民群众鸣放的革命的“火”，这是圣洁的“火”。这火当然也是对我们每一个人（并非对他一个），这却是好事，因为它又证明着我们确是革命者。我以为，不怕第一种火的人，就更用不着怕第二种“火”；在第一种“火”里烧不化的人，在第二种“火”里就更烧不化。难道我们还能相信，曾亲眼看着我们在反右派斗争中经历考验，证明了我们是忠实于社会主义事业的人，反会用火把我们“烧化”。有可能被烧化的，还是那种身上含金太少，或根本不含金的人。这种人脸上虽然贴着金，内里却全是杂质；虽能躲过第一种“火”，却躲不过第二种火去。这不又正是我们所希望的吗？
    这位厂长，可能感觉到自己身上缺点太严重，因此感到有被“烧化了”的可能，但依我看他倒是不会烧化的，因为他究竟还感觉到自己也有“真金”呀。只要不害怕批评，不拒绝批评，感到缺点严重，反会变成有利于改正缺点的。
    其实，我们的人中，含有真金又含有杂质的人居多。这也并不奇怪。真金未被提炼以前，总是同杂质结合一起的。世上没有不经冶炼的真金，也就没有天生成的完美无缺的革命者。伟大的革命领袖，也是由于自觉的冶炼而成的。真金只要不同杂质溶成不解之物，就终可以成为真金；我们只要勇于改正缺点，便终于能成为良好的革命者。我们应该自信自己身上的真金，这样就用不着怕“火”。经过第二种火的冶炼，我们会变为金光灼耀的纯金，这有什么不好。然而这就要有勇气跃进这大熔炉，而且要力求摆脱身上的杂质才行。
    怕“火”，本身是一种对金的腐蚀剂。因怕就会力求避之，有所抗拒，就终于会使金变质。那就真有被“烧化”的危险了。天津那个被停职反省的岳书亮同志，就接近了这种危险。
    久居北方的人（南方我不知道），都知道过去农村过年时的一种风俗。河北省叫“燎草”。在除夕的黄昏，家家门前烧起一堆甘草火来（有些还放上柏树枝），一边便鸣放花炮。这时所有的人围绕着，把手伸向火。青年和儿童们还要从火上跳过去。据说，经这火烤过的人，就能去掉身上的病，没病的人便百病不生。能跳过去的人就更好。在陕北的农村，除夕也有这风俗。不过，大概因为那里是山多地少吧，便不肯把甘草来烧，倒是从山上砍枯枝来烧。那毕毕剥剥燃着的熊熊火焰，真使人有一种圣洁的感觉。这时，能跳的人便都来跳。这叫作“燎百病”。我曾被拉着跳过一次。我说我并不相信这能“燎百病”。但他们说“不管信不信，跳跳对你没坏处”。于是，我便跳了过去。
    我想，可以把整风的“火”，看作那种“燎百病”的火。大家都来跳一跳。农民的那种作法，虽然有些迷信的色彩，但那种把火看作圣洁，而勇于跳火去病的精神和意念，还是可以学习的。当然，跳整风之火，不会像跳那种火那样轻快，甚至会有燎肤之痛，有煎熬之感；但比起那种火来，在“燎病”上，却是真正顶事的。
    可曾见过不经火的冶炼，而能除掉杂质，成为真金的吗？让我们含笑跳进这火里去吧。没有跳火的决心，是无法狠狠地改进工作和改正缺点的。
