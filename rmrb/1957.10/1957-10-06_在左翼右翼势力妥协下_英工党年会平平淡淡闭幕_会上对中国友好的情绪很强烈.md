Xinhua News Agency, Brighton, 4th - After a week of meetings, the British Labour Party annual conference closed here today.

On the final day of the meeting, the colonial issue was discussed, and some promises were made. A resolution was passed promising that after the Labour Party comes to power, it will grant independence to British colonies "within a certain period," and "if possible," will keep those former colonies that have gained independence within the Commonwealth.

This annual meeting passed policy guidelines that were more active than those of the Conservative Party, but due to compromises between left and right wing forces and the manipulation of the Labour Party leadership, some resolutions passed by the annual meeting were clearly unable to satisfy the demands of the representatives or adapt to the requirements of the constantly changing situation.

The annual meeting vehemently criticized the government's fiscal and economic policies aimed at creating unemployment and attacking the people's living standards, but failed to put forward any concrete suggestions for resolving the serious domestic financial difficulties. The resolution on nationalization is a clear example of implementing a compromise. This resolution, if not abandoning real nationalization, will certainly postpone it.

The annual meeting passed a resolution demanding the abolition of the Rent Act, but did not stipulate immediate concrete measures to protect the interests of the working people threatened by the Rent Act.

In terms of foreign policy, the annual meeting called for talks with the Soviet Union, China, and the People's Democratic countries, the conclusion of a five-power agreement on the basis of a European security agreement, the peaceful restoration of German unity, disarmament, and the development of international trade. On the hydrogen bomb issue, the annual meeting called on the British government to strive for an international agreement to stop hydrogen bomb tests. In this regard, many representatives had demanded that Britain unilaterally cease testing and producing such weapons. However, the Executive Committee rejected this request.

Strong friendly sentiments towards China were evident at the meeting. The representatives passed a resolution calling for the admission of China to the United Nations Security Council. Whenever this issue was mentioned, the representatives would erupt in warm applause.

Regarding this issue, the chairman said in her opening speech that one of the basic problems affecting the world is that China continues to be excluded from the United Nations, but she also said that the Taiwan issue should be resolved through so-called plebiscites. The representatives' reaction to the chairman's remarks on the Taiwan issue was lukewarm.

### 在左翼右翼势力妥协下  英工党年会平平淡淡闭幕  会上对中国友好的情绪很强烈

    在左翼右翼势力妥协下
    英工党年会平平淡淡闭幕
    会上对中国友好的情绪很强烈
    据新华社布莱顿4日电　英国工党年会开会一个星期后，今天在这里闭幕。
    在最后一天会议上，讨论了殖民地问题，并且许下了一些诺言。会上通过了一项决议，答应在工党执政后将“在一定时期内”让英国的殖民地独立，“如果可能的话”，将使那些得到独立的前殖民地留在英联邦之内。
    这次年会通过了比保守党较为积极的政策方针，但是，由于左翼右翼势力之间的妥协和工党领导操纵的结果，年会通过的某些决议显然不能满足代表们的要求，也不能适应不断变化的局势的要求。
    年会猛烈抨击政府以制造失业和进攻人民生活水平为目标的财政经济政策，但是没有能够提出任何解决国内严重财政困难的具体建议。关于国有化的决议是一个明显的实行妥协的例子，这项决议即使不是抛弃也一定会推迟真正的国有化。
    年会通过决议要求取消房租法，但是并没有规定立刻采取具体措施来保卫受到房租法威胁的劳动人民的利益。
    在外交政策方面，年会要求同苏联、中国和人民民主国家会谈，在欧洲安全协定的基础上缔结五大国协定，和平恢复德国统一，裁减军备，发展国际贸易等。在氢弹问题上，年会要求英国政府争取达成停止氢弹试验的国际协议。在这方面，许多代表曾经要求由英国单方面停止试验和生产这种武器。但是执行委员会拒绝了这个要求。
    会上对中国友好的情绪很强烈。代表们通过了一项决议要求接纳中国参加联合国安全理事会。每当有人提到这个问题的时候，代表们总要发出热烈的掌声。
    关于这个问题，主席在致开幕词的时候说影响世界的基本问题之一是中国被继续排斥在联合国之外，但是她却又说台湾问题应当通过所谓公民投票的方法来解决。代表们对主席关于台湾问题的言论的反应很冷淡。
