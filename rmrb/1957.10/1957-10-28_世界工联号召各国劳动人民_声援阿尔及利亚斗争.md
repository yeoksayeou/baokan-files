Xinhua News Agency, Prague, October 27th - The Secretariat of the World Federation of Trade Unions issued a communique on the 26th for the upcoming Day of Solidarity with the Algerian People.

The communique stated that November 15th of this year, the day the United Nations begins discussing the Algerian issue, will become a day for the whole world to support the Algerian people in their struggle for national independence. In view of this, the Fourth World Trade Union Congress passed a declaration to all trade union organizations and working people of the world. This day of struggle and action will be carried out under the slogan of "Give Algeria National Independence and Peace." On this day, working people will demand:

	Stop the use of torture, mutilation, and inhumane repression against the Algerian people and workers;
	Immediately release the working people and patriotic fighters imprisoned or detained;
	The Algerian people should enjoy and freely exercise all trade union and democratic rights, and all prohibitions and unequal treatment against Algerian trade unions and democratic groups should be abolished.

The communique concluded by saying that the World Federation of Trade Unions firmly believes that the working people and all trade unions of the world, regardless of nationality or belief, will do everything possible to stop the unjust war against the Algerian people, thereby helping them to win national independence.
