    "High in the sky hangs a big red lantern,
    A red 'happiness' character in the middle, redder still.
    Posters cover the walls, layer upon layer,
    Opinions from everywhere gathered together. …"

    This is a congratulatory big character poster written by the employees of the Changxindian Railway Factory to celebrate the National Day and the factory's rectification movement. People call this big character poster the "Happiness Character Poster" because it truthfully expresses, in simple language, the enthusiastic support and immense joy of all the factory's employees for this rectification movement.

    The employees of the Changxindian Railway Factory, with their glorious revolutionary tradition from the "February 7th" strike and their high degree of working-class consciousness, have many who usually treat the factory completely like their own home. As soon as the rectification began, many veteran workers actively offered opinions and wrote big character posters in the spirit of cherishing the Party and running the factory well. The first big character poster criticized the Party branch secretary of a workshop, demanding that he change his work style of not going deep into the masses. After the rectification mobilization report, 150 big character posters were put up on the first day, and 1,500 by the third day. The enthusiasm of the employees and the rapid development of the movement far exceeded the leadership's expectations. For a time, even the prepared pens, ink, and paper were insufficient, so people were sent to Beijing to buy them overnight. The entire big character poster writing center was packed with people, and several large pots of paste were used for posting the big character posters every day. On both sides of the half-mile-long road inside the factory, people looked at the big character posters like they were attending a fair. The walls were completely covered where people could reach, so some people brought ladders to post them under the eaves. Family members holding children and old ladies leaning on crutches also came to see the big character posters in groups, asking their grandchildren to explain them. Retired veteran workers also came to the factory to offer opinions. Some veteran workers from the "February 7th" era stood there discussing, "I have worked in this factory for more than fifty years, through several dynasties, but I have never seen such a scene!" "In the old society, would you dare to offer opinions? If you said something wrong, you would be fined at best, or at worst, you would be given a dismissal slip and your family would starve!"

    From August 29th to September 19th, more than 5,300 employees of the entire factory posted more than 12,000 big character posters, with more than 21,000 opinions, more than two-thirds of which were about production management, cadre work style, and other work-related issues. Almost all leading cadres at all levels of the Party, government, labor union, and Youth League in the factory were criticized by name or given opinions. The tens of thousands of opinions involved every corner of the factory and every aspect of the work. It was an unprecedented and thorough democratic inspection, giving the factory and the thinking of many people a good cleansing. Of the work-related problems that were relatively easy to solve within the factory, 80% of the opinions were resolved within a month. Everyone who offered an opinion not only received a written reply, but some also made self-criticisms in person and solicited opinions.

    In the past, some production management personnel only paid attention to the so-called big problems in production, while often disregarding the so-called specific small problems that were closely related to each employee. Workers' opinions were often ignored. For example, the workers in the iron frame team of the passenger car workshop, because they often worked at high altitudes, needed safety belts. They had offered opinions many times in the past, but there were no results. The workers said angrily that they would probably have to wait until someone was injured and the factory paid for their retirement before they would get safety belts. This time, the workers wrote a big character poster about the safety belt issue to the technician of the equipment section and posted it at his door. The technician panicked when he saw it, but he didn't have the authority to solve it himself, so he wrote three big character posters to the safety technology section, the equipment section, and the factory director, respectively, and posted them at their doors. The problem was quickly resolved. The workers said that these few big character posters were better than offering opinions for three years.

    The procrastination in work and the buck-passing between departments were the most troublesome things in tense collective production. In the past, it was almost impossible to find an effective cure for this stubborn disease. This time, the big character posters made sharp and powerful criticisms of these shortcomings. Zhang Jinbang, the foreman of the water pipe team in the power workshop, was known throughout the factory for his procrastination. People said that his work was "responsive to requests, but what he said didn't count." In the past, many houses were not heated on time, water pipes leaked, and toilets were blocked, but they could never be found to repair them. This time, the big character posters gave the water pipe team more than thirty opinions, and Zhang Jinbang recorded them all in a notebook. He took several workers and, in just half a month, thoroughly repaired all the water pipes and toilets. People said that Zhang Jinbang's water pipe team is now truly "responsive to requests."

    The production scheduling section felt the most strongly about the buck-passing phenomenon in work. Chen Rui, the deputy section chief of the scheduling section, said that in the past, in order to organize and schedule the forces of various workshops and sections to jointly solve problems in production, he had to run his legs off and talk until his mouth was dry. The scheduling section was simply like a court, constantly settling disputes for various units. In the past, each section and workshop held on to its own corner, and even small things would be argued over. After the criticism of the big character posters and the self-criticisms of many people, everyone is now able to consciously and proactively support and cooperate with each other, and a new atmosphere of unity and cooperation has emerged. Many things are now easier to handle. The balance rate of recent production has increased significantly. The number of locomotive return repair parts has decreased, and the delivery time has been shortened, because of better collaboration and cooperation between departments.

    The big character posters thoroughly promoted democracy, exposed shortcomings in all aspects, and work has been improved. The production enthusiasm of the employees is also different. Fu Chuanlin, a technician who came from a worker background, said of this rectification, "I feel very happy. In the past, there were problems that were not resolved when opinions were raised, and I was somewhat passive in my mood. Now, when I raise them, they can have an effect, and I work harder and harder!" I asked Old Chen, known as the locomotive doctor who can repair all kinds of locomotives, what he was most satisfied with in the rectification? He immediately replied, "I am most satisfied with the improvement of the quality of locomotive repairs; the change of the procrastination style, and the immediate resolution of problems, so that people are not anxious. Now when we work, everyone discusses it and works quickly, doing things neatly and decisively, so we are happy to work." This is almost the unanimous reaction of the workers to this rectification. Wu Qingyu, a veteran worker from the "February 7th" strike, believes that this rectification is truly an assessment of the work of the entire factory and the thinking of everyone, and that all problems have been revealed and the factory has been thoroughly cleansed.

### 长辛店铁路工厂的大字报

    长辛店铁路工厂的大字报
    参加过“二七”大罢工的老工人看到大字报贴出很多，工作及时在改进，认为“这次整风真是给工厂彻底洗了个澡。”
    本报记者　林沫
    “高空悬挂大红灯，
    红字中间喜字红。
    墙上字报贴重重，
    各处意见集了中。……
    这是长辛店铁路工厂的职工为庆祝国庆和工厂整风运动而写的祝贺性的大字报。人们把这张大字报叫“喜子报”，因为它以朴素的语言，如实地道出了这个工厂全体职工对这次整风运动的热烈拥护和万分喜悦的心情。
    具有“二七”大罢工的光荣革命传统和高度工人阶级觉悟的长辛店铁路工厂的职工们，有许多人平时是把工厂完全当作自己的家一样来看待的。整风一开始，许多老工人就本着爱护党和办好工厂的精神，积极提意见，写大字报。第一张大字报就是批评一个车间的党支部书记，要求他改变不深入群众的作风的。整风动员报告以后，第一天贴出了大字报一百五十张，到第三天就贴出了一千五百张。职工的热情和运动发展的迅速远超出领导的估计，一时连准备的笔墨和纸张都不够用，赶紧连夜派人到北京去买。整个大字报代写处都挤满了人，贴大字报的浆糊一天要用几大锅。厂内半里长的马路两旁，看大字报的人像赶会一样。墙上是人够到的地方都给贴满了，有人就搬来一张张的梯子，往房檐下边贴。有些大字报是针对某个部门或某个人的，就贴在谁家的门口。抱着孩子的家属，拄着拐杖的老太婆，一群群地也来看大字报，让孙子、孙女给讲解。已经退休的老工友，也特地到厂里来提意见。有些“二七”时代的老工人，站在那里谈论着：“我在这厂干了五十多年，经过了几个朝代，这样的场面可是没见过呵！”“旧社会你还敢提意见？一句话说不对了，轻则罚款，重则就写一张条子刷了你，让你家里吃去吧！”
    从8月29日到9月19日，全厂五千三百多职工共贴出大字报一万二千多张，所提的意见有二万一千多条，其中三分之二以上都是关于生产管理、干部作风等工作方面的问题。全厂党、政、工、团的各级领导干部几乎人人都被指名批评或给提了意见。几万条意见，涉及到工厂的各个角落和工作的各个方面，是一次从来未有的彻底的民主大检查，给工厂以及许多人的思想好好洗了个澡。凡属工作方面的在厂内比较容易解决的，在一个月之内，80％的意见都得到了解决。每个提意见的人，不但得到了书面答复，有的还当面检讨，征求意见。
    过去，有些生产管理人员只注意生产中的所谓大问题，而对于和每个职工切身有关的所谓具体的小问题，却往往不当回事，工人提意见也置之不理。譬如客车车间铁架组的工人，因为常在高空作业，需要安全带，过去提了多少次意见也没结果。工人气的说，这大概要等把人摔伤，工厂出钱给养老，那时才会给安全带。这次工人对安全带的事给设备科的技术员写了一张大字报，贴在他门口。技术员一看着了慌，但他自己也没权力解决，于是就一连给安全技术科、设备科和厂长写了三张大字报，分别贴在他们门口。问题很快得到了解决。工人说这几张大字报胜过提意见提三年。
    工作中的拖拉作风和各部门之间的扯皮现象，在紧张的集体生产中是最使人头痛的事了。过去对这种顽固的病症简直难以找到有效的良药。这次大字报对这方面的缺点进行了尖锐和有力的批评。动力车间水管班领工员张金榜，过去作风拖拉，全厂闻名。人们说他对工作是“有求必应，说了不算。”过去有很多房子的暖气到时不热，水管漏水，厕所不通，找他们修理就是找不来。这次大字报给水管班提了三十多条意见，张金榜一一记在本子上。他带着几个工友，不过半个月，把所有的水管、厕所都彻底整修好了。人们说，张金榜的水管班现在真是“有求必应”。
    对工作中的扯皮现象，生产调度科感觉最为强烈。调度科副科长陈瑞说，过去他为组织和调度各车间、各科室的力量，共同解决生产中的问题，要跑断腿、说破嘴，调度科简直像法院一样，要常为各单位断官司。过去各科室、各车间各抱一角，一些小事情也要互相争执。经过大字报的批评和许多人的检讨，现在大家能够自觉地和比较主动地互相支援配合，出现了团结合作的新风气，许多事都好办了。最近生产的均衡率显著提高。机车回修的部件减少，交代时间缩短，就是因为各部门之间协作配合比较好。
    大字报彻底发扬了民主，揭露了各方面的缺点，工作得到改进，职工的生产情绪也不同了。工人出身的技术员傅传林对这次整风说：“我感觉很痛快，过去有问题摆着，提了意见不解决，情绪上就有些消极。现在提了能发生作用，工作越干越有劲！”我问号称机车大夫，能修理各种机车的老陈发，整风最使他满意的是什么？他立即回答说：“我最满意的是提高了机车的修理质量；改变了拖拉作风，有了问题马上解决，不叫人心急了。现在干活，大伙一合计，赶紧干，作活马利，办事干脆，这样咱们干活就高兴。”这差不多是工人们对这次整风的一致反应。“二七”老工人吴清玉认为：这次整风，真是给全厂的工作以及每人的思想作鉴定，什么问题都显出来了，工厂彻底洗了个澡。
