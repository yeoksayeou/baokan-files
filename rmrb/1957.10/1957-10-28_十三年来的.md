    Thirteen Years of Guatemala
    By Ricardo Ramirez, Guatemalan Youth Representative
    The Guatemalans are descendants of the Mayans, who possessed the most splendid ancient civilization on the American continent. Mayan culture reached its peak from 200 BC to the 1st century AD. Currently, Guatemala has a population of 3.5 million and an area of 110,000 square kilometers.
    Guatemala gained independence from Spanish rule on September 15, 1821. However, feudal landlords used this independence to further exploit the people for their own benefit, eventually offering the country's wealth to American imperialism.
    Until the outbreak of the bourgeois democratic revolution in 1944, Guatemala was under the military dictatorship that represented the interests of Guatemalan, Spanish, and German landlords, as well as the interests of American monopoly capital and comprador bourgeoisie. To ensure their maximum benefit, the dictators did not grant even the most basic rights to workers, peasants, and the petty bourgeoisie.
    Foreign capital in Guatemala was mainly concentrated in the following enterprises: (1) United Fruit Company, which controlled 7% of the country's farmland, all seaports, and part of the telegraph and telephone enterprises; (2) International Railways of Central America, which completely controlled the country's railway transportation; (3) Electric Bond and Share Company, which controlled the country's power generation enterprises; (4) Grace Shipping Company, which shared the monopoly on maritime transportation with United Fruit Company; (5) Pan American Airways, which controlled international air routes; (6) All America Cables and Radio, which, together with United Fruit Company, monopolized the country's telegraph and telephone enterprises. Thus, with the support of feudal landlords and comprador and usurious bourgeoisie, American monopoly enterprises finally controlled, and still control, 75% of Guatemala's national economy.
    Under these circumstances, the peasants suffered the most. Their lives were almost the same as they had been 200 years ago during the Spanish colonial period. Wages were miserably low on the plantations of the United Fruit Company, but the situation was even worse for those who worked in the manors of the landlords in a semi-slave condition. Not only did they have to work for the landlords for free in the coffee plantations, but they also had to hand over two-thirds of the harvest from their own small plots of land as rent. In many parts of the country, landlords could enact their own laws, impose punishments and sentences, and sell workers as commodities when buying and selling land.
    The living standards in Guatemala were among the lowest in Latin America, and cultural life was completely neglected. 80% of the illiterate population was directly influenced by American films, magazines, and other tools of cultural aggression.
    In 1944, under the impetus of the world democratic wave triggered by the anti-fascist war and the victory of the Soviet Red Army, a mass movement involving a large number of workers, the petty bourgeoisie, and part of the army and national bourgeoisie overthrew the reactionary government of Guatemala through armed action. At that time, there was no working-class party. Under the brutal repression of previous governments, even the trade union movement had difficulty developing. In the early stages of this revolution, the leadership was limited to the national bourgeoisie and part of the revolutionary petty bourgeoisie.
    This meant that the first revolutionary government dared neither to face the country's fundamental economic problems nor to openly oppose imperialism. It confined itself to implementing some political and social reforms, granting democratic rights to the people, and making some improvements in the cultural field.
    However, the significance of this change was still considerable. It created conditions for the organization of the working class and peasants, and for the birth of the Guatemalan Labor Party (Communist Party). The emergence of this party and the driving role it played in the later stages of the revolution made it the most important member of the current Guatemalan revolutionary movement.
    The second revolutionary government was formed under different circumstances. The newly born Communist Party quickly gained decisive political influence in national life, especially in the workers' movement, which already had a unified national organization. The working class and peasants demanded not only democratic rights and a certain degree of reform, but also fundamental changes in the country's economic situation. Therefore, on the basis of a clear political program agreed upon by all democratic parties (including the Communist Party), the National Confederation of Labor, and the National Farmers Association, the new president was elected by an overwhelming majority. The core of this political program was to implement land reform.
    Before the land reform, 70% of the land was owned by landlords who accounted for 2% of the total population. Fifty-one landlords (less than 0.17% of the landlords) owned 13.78% of the country's land. The United Fruit Company alone occupied 7% of the country's land. However, 161,501 small landowners nationwide owned only 3.46% of the land. 57% of the peasants had no land at all.
    Due to the particularities of our environment, the land reform was carried out in a relatively moderate manner. Nevertheless, the land reform was still the most profound and important change in Guatemala's history, and the most important and profound event that Latin America had never experienced. 100,000 peasant households received land, thousands of head of cattle, and $5 million in loans from the state. 554,865 hectares of land were distributed. After the land reform, the country's total annual output value increased from the pre-revolutionary peak of $131 million to $558 million.
    What happened after that is well known to everyone. Imperialist forces launched armed intervention in Guatemala, and, taking advantage of the hesitation of the national bourgeoisie and the betrayal of senior military officers, overthrew the democratic government, destroying the revolution and its main achievements. Once the democratic government was overthrown, the bloodiest massacre in Guatemala's history began. All political organizations were strangled and closed down. Leaders of various social organizations, trade unions, political parties, youth groups, and student unions were arrested, massacred, and exiled. The land reform was declared illegal, and the peasants' land was forcibly taken back. 4,000 peasants lost their lives for refusing to give up their land. The previous government's plans to build hydroelectric power stations, highways, and seaports were handed over to the old monopoly capital and new American oil enterprises through new leases. Twenty-nine oil companies obtained the right to explore and exploit oil for their own benefit on 7,892,566 hectares of land nationwide (the entire republic has only 11 million hectares of land). The direct result of the puppet government established after the armed intervention abandoning land reform and offering the country's main resources to American monopoly capital was the occurrence of a severe economic crisis for two consecutive years. The working class and peasants bore the brunt of this crisis.
    After the fascist puppet government fostered by the U.S. State Department and monopoly capital signed a military mutual assistance agreement with the United States, thereby being able to drag the Guatemalan people into any military conflict conducted by the United States, Guatemala became even more dependent on the United States, not only economically but also politically and militarily.
    However, the Guatemalan people, who had personally experienced the fruits of the struggle for freedom and independence for ten years, have not been defeated. Recent developments in our country indicate that persecuted and suppressed democratic forces have made considerable progress in reorganizing their forces. Trade unions have reappeared with legal status. The workers have prevented the government's conspiracy to seize leadership of the trade unions. For three years, in every May Day celebration parade, the working class has dealt a powerful blow to the government. The large-scale mass parades they organized have boosted the people's confidence and awareness. Today, the most intense struggle is to fight for legal status for peasant organizations.
    Students have also waged extremely important struggles in the struggle for legal rights. They launched strong protests against those anti-democratic measures that made land reform illegal and arbitrarily carried out persecution. They mobilized a broad range of petty-bourgeois intellectuals to oppose offering national wealth to foreigners and to demand the return of lost rights and freedoms. The struggle in June of last year even resulted in government troops firing on student parades protesting against the government. Several student leaders were killed, and a sense of anger enveloped the country, so that the authorities had to declare martial law.
    At the same time, the contradictions between the factions that make up the government are also intensifying. Some people have withdrawn from the government due to seeing the government's extreme corruption and treasonous behavior. The assassination of President Armas, who was installed by the Americans, is only evidence of the government's internal corruption and the desperate struggle of those in power. Although the person who succeeded Armas as president immediately launched a bloody suppression, he also had to announce that free elections would be held soon in order to ease people's concerns, due to feeling the tense mood of the general population.
    The underground Guatemalan Labor Party is leading the people in an unremitting struggle. In the struggle against imperialism and for national independence and national unity, the Guatemalan Communist Party is also unremittingly fighting for world peace, friendship, and cooperation. The Guatemalan people are fighting with confidence to achieve the above goals and believe that people from all over the world are standing on their side.
