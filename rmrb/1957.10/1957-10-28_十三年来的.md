    Thirteen Years of Guatemala
    By Ricardo Ramirez, Guatemalan Youth Representative
    The Guatemalans are descendants of the Mayans, who possessed the most splendid ancient civilization on the American continent. Mayan culture reached its peak from 200 BC to the 1st century AD. Currently, Guatemala has a population of 3.5 million and an area of 110,000 square kilometers.
    Guatemala gained independence from Spanish rule on September 15, 1821. However, feudal landlords used this independence to further exploit the people for their own benefit, eventually offering the country's wealth to American imperialism.
    Until the outbreak of the bourgeois democratic revolution in 1944, Guatemala was under the military dictatorship that represented the interests of Guatemalan, Spanish, and German landlords, as well as the interests of American monopoly capital and comprador bourgeoisie. To ensure their maximum benefit, the dictators did not grant even the most basic rights to workers, peasants, and the petty bourgeoisie.
    Foreign capital in Guatemala was mainly concentrated in the following enterprises: (1) United Fruit Company, which controlled 7% of the country's farmland, all seaports, and part of the telegraph and telephone enterprises; (2) International Railways of Central America, which completely controlled the country's railway transportation; (3) Electric Bond and Share Company, which controlled the country's power generation enterprises; (4) Grace Shipping Company, which shared the monopoly on maritime transportation with United Fruit Company; (5) Pan American Airways, which controlled international air routes; (6) All America Cables and Radio, which, together with United Fruit Company, monopolized the country's telegraph and telephone enterprises. Thus, with the support of feudal landlords and comprador and usurious bourgeoisie, American monopoly enterprises finally controlled, and still control, 75% of Guatemala's national economy.
    Under these circumstances, the peasants suffered the most. Their lives were almost the same as they had been 200 years ago during the Spanish colonial period. Wages were miserably low on the plantations of the United Fruit Company, but the situation was even worse for those who worked in the manors of the landlords in a semi-slave condition. Not only did they have to work for the landlords for free in the coffee plantations, but they also had to hand over two-thirds of the harvest from their own small plots of land as rent. In many parts of the country, landlords could enact their own laws, impose punishments and sentences, and sell workers as commodities when buying and selling land.
    The living standards in Guatemala were among the lowest in Latin America, and cultural life was completely neglected. 80% of the illiterate population was directly influenced by American films, magazines, and other tools of cultural aggression.
    In 1944, under the impetus of the world democratic wave triggered by the anti-fascist war and the victory of the Soviet Red Army, a mass movement involving a large number of workers, the petty bourgeoisie, and part of the army and national bourgeoisie overthrew the reactionary government of Guatemala through armed action. At that time, there was no working-class party. Under the brutal repression of previous governments, even the trade union movement had difficulty developing. In the early stages of this revolution, the leadership was limited to the national bourgeoisie and part of the revolutionary petty bourgeoisie.
    This meant that the first revolutionary government dared neither to face the country's fundamental economic problems nor to openly oppose imperialism. It confined itself to implementing some political and social reforms, granting democratic rights to the people, and making some improvements in the cultural field.
    However, the significance of this change was still considerable. It created conditions for the organization of the working class and peasants, and for the birth of the Guatemalan Labor Party (Communist Party). The emergence of this party and the driving role it played in the later stages of the revolution made it the most important member of the current Guatemalan revolutionary movement.
    The second revolutionary government was formed under different circumstances. The newly born Communist Party quickly gained decisive political influence in national life, especially in the workers' movement, which already had a unified national organization. The working class and peasants demanded not only democratic rights and a certain degree of reform, but also fundamental changes in the country's economic situation. Therefore, on the basis of a clear political program agreed upon by all democratic parties (including the Communist Party), the National Confederation of Labor, and the National Farmers Association, the new president was elected by an overwhelming majority. The core of this political program was to implement land reform.
    Before the land reform, 70% of the land was owned by landlords who accounted for 2% of the total population. Fifty-one landlords (less than 0.17% of the landlords) owned 13.78% of the country's land. The United Fruit Company alone occupied 7% of the country's land. However, 161,501 small landowners nationwide owned only 3.46% of the land. 57% of the peasants had no land at all.
    Due to the particularities of our environment, the land reform was carried out in a relatively moderate manner. Nevertheless, the land reform was still the most profound and important change in Guatemala's history, and the most important and profound event that Latin America had never experienced. 100,000 peasant households received land, thousands of head of cattle, and $5 million in loans from the state. 554,865 hectares of land were distributed. After the land reform, the country's total annual output value increased from the pre-revolutionary peak of $131 million to $558 million.
    What happened after that is well known to everyone. Imperialist forces launched armed intervention in Guatemala, and, taking advantage of the hesitation of the national bourgeoisie and the betrayal of senior military officers, overthrew the democratic government, destroying the revolution and its main achievements. Once the democratic government was overthrown, the bloodiest massacre in Guatemala's history began. All political organizations were strangled and closed down. Leaders of various social organizations, trade unions, political parties, youth groups, and student unions were arrested, massacred, and exiled. The land reform was declared illegal, and the peasants' land was forcibly taken back. 4,000 peasants lost their lives for refusing to give up their land. The previous government's plans to build hydroelectric power stations, highways, and seaports were handed over to the old monopoly capital and new American oil enterprises through new leases. Twenty-nine oil companies obtained the right to explore and exploit oil for their own benefit on 7,892,566 hectares of land nationwide (the entire republic has only 11 million hectares of land). The direct result of the puppet government established after the armed intervention abandoning land reform and offering the country's main resources to American monopoly capital was the occurrence of a severe economic crisis for two consecutive years. The working class and peasants bore the brunt of this crisis.
    After the fascist puppet government fostered by the U.S. State Department and monopoly capital signed a military mutual assistance agreement with the United States, thereby being able to drag the Guatemalan people into any military conflict conducted by the United States, Guatemala became even more dependent on the United States, not only economically but also politically and militarily.
    However, the Guatemalan people, who had personally experienced the fruits of the struggle for freedom and independence for ten years, have not been defeated. Recent developments in our country indicate that persecuted and suppressed democratic forces have made considerable progress in reorganizing their forces. Trade unions have reappeared with legal status. The workers have prevented the government's conspiracy to seize leadership of the trade unions. For three years, in every May Day celebration parade, the working class has dealt a powerful blow to the government. The large-scale mass parades they organized have boosted the people's confidence and awareness. Today, the most intense struggle is to fight for legal status for peasant organizations.
    Students have also waged extremely important struggles in the struggle for legal rights. They launched strong protests against those anti-democratic measures that made land reform illegal and arbitrarily carried out persecution. They mobilized a broad range of petty-bourgeois intellectuals to oppose offering national wealth to foreigners and to demand the return of lost rights and freedoms. The struggle in June of last year even resulted in government troops firing on student parades protesting against the government. Several student leaders were killed, and a sense of anger enveloped the country, so that the authorities had to declare martial law.
    At the same time, the contradictions between the factions that make up the government are also intensifying. Some people have withdrawn from the government due to seeing the government's extreme corruption and treasonous behavior. The assassination of President Armas, who was installed by the Americans, is only evidence of the government's internal corruption and the desperate struggle of those in power. Although the person who succeeded Armas as president immediately launched a bloody suppression, he also had to announce that free elections would be held soon in order to ease people's concerns, due to feeling the tense mood of the general population.
    The underground Guatemalan Labor Party is leading the people in an unremitting struggle. In the struggle against imperialism and for national independence and national unity, the Guatemalan Communist Party is also unremittingly fighting for world peace, friendship, and cooperation. The Guatemalan people are fighting with confidence to achieve the above goals and believe that people from all over the world are standing on their side.

    十三年来的危地马拉
    危地马拉青年代表　里查多·拉米来兹
    危地马拉人原是具有美洲大陆最灿烂的古老文明的马雅人的后裔。马雅人的文化在纪元前二百年到第一世纪曾发展到最高峰。目前危地马拉有三百五十万人口，面积十一万平方公里。
    危地马拉是在1821年9月15日从西班牙的统治下取得独立的。但是封建地主却利用这次独立来为自己的利益更进一步压榨人民，并终于把国家的财富奉送给美帝国主义。
    直到1944年资产阶级民主革命爆发时，危地马拉还是在代表危地马拉、西班牙和德国的地主的利益、代表美国垄断资本和买办资产阶级利益的军事独裁统治之下。独裁者们为了确保他们的最大利益，甚至连最起码的权利都不给予工人、农民和小资产阶级。
    危地马拉的外国资本主要集中在下列几个企业中：（1）联合果品公司，控制着全国7％的农地、所有的海港和一部分电报电话企业；（2）中美洲国际铁路公司，完全控制着全国的铁路交通；（3）证券股份公司控制着全国的发电企业；（4）格雷斯果品公司，它同联合果品公司分享着对海上运输的垄断；（5）泛美航空公司，控制着国际航空线；（6）全美电报和无线电公司，它和联合果品公司一道垄断了全国的电报电话企业。这样，在封建地主和买办及高利贷资产阶级的支持下，美国的大垄断企业终于控制了而且现在仍然控制着危地马拉75％的国民经济。
    在这种情况下，农民受到最大的苦难，他们现在的生活几乎同二百年以前在西班牙殖民时期所过的生活差不多。在联合果品公司的种植园里，工资低得可怜，但是更坏的是在地主的邑地上工作的那些人的半奴隶处境。他们不仅要在咖啡种植园中白白地为地主工作，而且还要交出他们自己耕种的一小块地的收获物的三分之二作为地租。在全国的许多地方，地主可以颁布他们的法律、进行处罚和判刑，并在买卖土地时把工人也当作商品一道买卖。
    危地马拉的生活水平甚至在拉丁美洲也是最低的，文化生活完全被漠视。全国80％的文盲都直接在美国影片、杂志和其他文化侵略工具的影响之下。
    1944年，在反法西斯战争和苏联红军的胜利所掀起的世界民主浪潮的激荡下，一个席卷全国大量工人、小资产阶级和一部分军队和民族资产阶级的群众运动，通过武装行动推翻了危地马拉的反动政府。当时还没有工人阶级的政党。在以往各届政府的横暴压制下，甚至工会运动都很难展开。在这次革命的初期，进行领导的仅限于民族资产阶级和一部分革命的小资产阶级。
    这就使得第一届革命政府既不敢正视国家的基本经济问题，又不敢公开反对帝国主义，它仅限于实行一些政治和社会改革、把民主权利给予人民，并在文化领域方面作了一些改进。
    但是，这个变化的意义还是很大的。它为组织工人阶级和农民，为危地马拉劳动党（共产党）的诞生创造了条件。而这个党的出现以及它在那次革命后期所起的推动作用，使它成为目前危地马拉革命运动中最重要的一员。
    第二届革命政府是在不同的情况下组成的。新诞生的共产党在国家生活中，特别是在已有一个全国统一组织领导的工人运动中，很快取得了决定性的政治影响。工人阶级和农民不仅要求民主权利和一定程度的改革，而且也要求基本改变国家的经济情况。因此，在一个为所有民主党派（其中包括共产党）、全国总工会和全国农民协会所同意的明确的政纲的基础上，新总统遂以压倒的多数当选。这个政纲的中心就是要实行土地改革。
    在土地改革之前，70％的土地为占全人口2％的地主所据有。五十一个地主（不到千分之一点七的地主）拥有全国13.78％的土地。仅联合果品公司就占有全国7％的土地。但是全国十六万一千五百零一个小的土地所有者却只有全国3.46％的土地。57％的农民则一点土地都没有。
    由于我国环境的特殊，土地改革的进行采取了较温和的步骤。尽管这样，土地改革仍然是危地马拉有史以来最深刻、最重要的一次变革，仍然是拉丁美洲所从未经历过的一次最重要、最深刻的事件。十万个农户得到了土地、成千头耕牛和国家所给予的五百万美元的贷款。五十五万四千八百六十五公顷土地被分配了。经过土地改革以后，国家每年的总产值从革命前的最高峰一亿三千一百万美元增加到五亿五千八百万美元。
    在这以后发生的事是大家都知道的。帝国主义势力向危地马拉发动了武装干涉，并利用民族资产阶级的迟疑不决和高级军官的叛变推翻了民主政府，毁掉了革命和它的主要成就。民主政府一旦被推翻，于是就开始了危地马拉有史以来最厉害的血腥屠杀。所有政治组织都遭到扼杀和封闭。各种社会组织、工会、政党、青年团体和学生联合会的领导人都被逮捕、屠杀和被放逐。土地改革被宣布为不合法，农民的土地又被用武力夺回去了。四千名农民因拒绝让出土地而失掉了性命。以前政府建立水电站、公路和海港的计划又通过新的租借交给了旧日的垄断资本和新的美国石油企业。二十九家石油公司取得了在全国七百八十九万二千五百六十六公顷土地上为自己的利益勘探和开采石油的权利（整个共和国只有一千一百万公顷的土地）。武装干涉以后建立的傀儡政府的废弃土地改革、把国家主要资源奉送给美国垄断资本的直接结果，使近两年来连续发生了严重经济危机。而承担这种危机灾难的则是工人阶级和农民。
    在美国国务院和垄断资本所扶植的法西斯傀儡政府同美国签订军事互助协定，从而能把危地马拉人民牵入任何美国所进行的军事冲突之后，危地马拉就不仅在经济上，而且也在政治和军事上更加依赖美国了。
    但是，十年来亲身体验了为自由和独立而斗争的成果的危地马拉人民并没有被击溃。最近我国情况的发展表明，受迫害和被压制的民主力量在重新组织自己的力量方面已取得相当的成功。工会已再度以合法的地位出现。工人们已防止了政府攫取工会领导权的阴谋。三年来在每次五一节的庆祝游行中，工人阶级都给了政府以有力的打击。他们所组织的大规模群众游行，提高了人民的信心和觉悟。今天最激烈的斗争是在为农民组织争取合法的地位。
    在争取合法权利方面学生们也进行了极重要的斗争。他们对于使土地改革成为非法和肆意进行迫害的那些反民主措施发动了强烈抗议。他们动员广大的小资产阶级知识分子来反对把国家财富奉送给外人并要求取回已失掉的权利和自由。去年6月的斗争，竟造成政府军队开枪射击反对政府的学生游行队伍的事件。几个学生领袖被杀死，愤怒的情绪笼罩了全国，以致当局不得不颁布了戒严。
    同时组成政府的各派系之间的矛盾也在加剧。一些人由于看到政府的极端腐化和卖国行为已经退出了政府。美国人所安插的阿马斯总统的被刺，仅仅是政府内部腐化和当权人物绝望挣扎的一个证据而已。在阿马斯死后继任总统的那个人虽然也立刻发动了血腥镇压，但是由于感到一般人民的紧张情绪，也不得不宣布不久要举行自由选举，借以缓和人心。
    处于地下的危地马拉劳动党正在领导着人民进行不倦的战斗。危地马拉共产党在反对帝国主义、争取民族独立和国家团结的斗争中，也在不倦地为世界和平、友谊和合作进行斗争。危地马拉人民为实现上述的目标正在满怀信心地进行战斗，并且相信全世界各国人民都是站在他们这方面的。
