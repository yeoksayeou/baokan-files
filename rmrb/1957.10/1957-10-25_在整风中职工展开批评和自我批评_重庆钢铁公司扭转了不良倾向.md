Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, October 23rd: Workers at Chongqing Iron and Steel Company, during the "Big Blooming and Big Contending" campaign, not only offered criticisms and suggestions regarding enterprise leadership and various aspects of work, but also engaged in mutual criticism and self-criticism.

Starting in October, workers in the first batch of eight workshops undergoing rectification in the company, while continuing to offer opinions on various aspects of the company's work, also criticized, through means such as discussion meetings, big-character posters, cartoons, and radio broadcasts, negative phenomena such as violation of labor discipline, failure to cherish state property, lack of enthusiasm for learning, and making excessive demands regarding living welfare opportunities during the rectification campaign. In the large rolling mill workshop, large steelmaking workshop, and iron smelting workshop, some workers failed to differentiate between public and private interests, taking work clothes issued for labor protection home to wear, even wearing them to parks and dances. Workers in the iron smelting workshop drew a cartoon criticizing this behavior. After being criticized, many workers voluntarily returned the extra labor protection items they had received to the public, and made self-criticisms at discussion meetings.

Two big-character posters titled "Notification by Gong" and "Fishy Pleasure Above All Else" appeared in the "Blooming and Contending Garden" of the iron smelting workshop, attracting the attention of many people. The former read: "We hereby announce the names of several people in our class who have been absent for several days since the start of blooming and contending, and cannot be found anywhere. Anyone who knows their whereabouts is requested to inform us immediately." The latter depicted a worker fishing by the river, with the clock behind him pointing to 1:30, which was precisely the time for study. After these two big-character posters were posted, the people being criticized immediately posted "My Self-Criticism" and a declaration stating "I have reported for work" next to them.

Many veteran workers also used their personal experiences to criticize the erroneous thinking of a small number of people who excessively emphasized living welfare. Through criticism and self-criticism, solidarity in the various workshops has been strengthened. Many people have corrected their work attitudes and voluntarily withdrawn their excessive demands. In the past, "passing the buck" often occurred during shift handover in the large steelmaking and large rolling mill workshops. After exchanging opinions, this phenomenon has now disappeared. Violations of labor discipline and non-compliance with operating procedures in workshops such as iron smelting, steelmaking, and rolling have also been greatly reduced compared to the past. Some workshops have even continuously set new production records.

    在整风中职工展开批评和自我批评
    重庆钢铁公司扭转了不良倾向
    新华社重庆23日电　重庆钢铁公司职工在大鸣大放中，除对企业领导和各方面工作提出批评和建议以外，同时展开了相互间的批评和自我批评。
    从10月份起，这个公司第一批开展整风的八个车间的职工，在继续对公司各方面工作提出意见的同时，对一些人违反劳动纪律、不爱护国家财产、不爱学习及趁整风机会在生活福利方面提出过高要求等不良现象，也通过座谈会、大字报、漫画、广播等方式，进行了批评。大型轧钢车间、大型炼钢车间、炼铁车间都有一部分工人公私不分，把应该在工作时穿的劳保衣服拿回家去穿，甚至穿去逛公园、跳舞。炼铁车间工人画了一幅漫画，批评这种行为。许多工人在受到批评以后，都自动把多领了的劳保用品交还了公家，并且在座谈会上作了检讨。
    炼铁车间的“鸣放园地”上出现了两张标题为“鸣锣通知”和“鱼乐至上”的大字报，吸引着许多人的注意，前一张上面写着：“兹有我班数人，自鸣放后缺席数天，四处找寻无着，现将姓名公布于后，知其下落者，请速告知”，后一张上面画着一个工人，在河边钓鱼，在他背后一架闹钟的时针指着一点半，这正是学习时间。这两张大字报贴出后，被批评的人马上在旁边贴了“我的检讨”和声明“我已上班报到”的大字报。
    许多老工人还以亲身经历，批判了少数人过分强调生活福利等错误思想。经过批评和自我批评，各个车间都加强了团结。不少人端正了劳动态度，自动取消了过高的要求。大型炼钢和大型轧钢车间过去交接班经常发生“扯皮”现象，经过互相提出意见以后，现在这种现象已经没有了。炼铁、炼钢、轧钢等车间违反劳动纪律、不遵守操作规程的现象也比过去大大减少，有的车间还连续创造了生产新纪录。
