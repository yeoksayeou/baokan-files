Premier Zhou Enlai's Speech

Your esteemed Excellency Prime Minister, dear friends, comrades:

Today I have the opportunity to attend this grand and magnificent banquet hosted by His Excellency Prime Minister Sardar Mohammed Daoud, and I feel very honored and delighted. I would like to take this opportunity to once again express my heartfelt gratitude to the distinguished Afghan guests who have come from afar.

The Chinese people and the Afghan people, like the people of other Asian and African countries, all love peace. Our common desire is to build our respective countries in a peaceful environment. Earlier this year, when Vice Premier He Long and I visited Afghanistan, we were deeply impressed by the warm hospitality of the Afghan people and their sincere desire for Sino-Afghan friendship and world peace.

Afghanistan and China are friendly neighbors, and our two countries have a long and profound friendship. According to historical records, the people of our two countries had friendly exchanges as early as before the Christian era. The famous Chinese traveler Fa Xian and the later famous Chinese scholar Xuanzang both visited Afghanistan with the friendship of the Chinese people. Afghans also made friendly visits to China in earlier days. The "Silk Road" connecting the borders of our two countries is imprinted with the long-term friendly footprints of the Chinese and Afghan peoples. Indeed, in past contacts, as His Excellency the Prime Minister once said, our relationship has never been damaged by differences and animosity. Between us, there is only a record of friendship and amity. This ancient friendship of ours has not only been restored today but has also been further developed. Now, His Excellency the Prime Minister has come to our country as an envoy of Afghan friendship, which makes us particularly happy. We believe that through His Excellency the Prime Minister's visit, the ancient and youthful friendship between the Chinese and Afghan peoples will surely be greatly strengthened.

During His Excellency the Prime Minister's stay in Beijing, we had the opportunity to conduct talks in a friendly and warm atmosphere and reached unanimous agreement on issues of common concern to China and Afghanistan. Through these exchanges of views, we have further understanding and trust in each other. Tomorrow, the esteemed guests will leave our capital to visit various parts of our country. I believe that during their visits to various parts of China, the distinguished guests will continue to see the Chinese people's sincere feelings and high respect for them.

I would like to take this opportunity to once again wish the friendship between the Chinese and Afghan peoples to be continuously consolidated and developed!

I propose a toast:

To peace in Asia and the world,

To the friendship between the Chinese and Afghan peoples,

To the prosperity of Afghanistan and the happiness of its people,

To the health of His Excellency Prime Minister Sardar Mohammed Daoud,

To the health of His Majesty King Mohammed Zahir,

Cheers!

专栏：

    周恩来总理的讲话尊敬的首相殿下，各位朋友，各位同志：
    今天我有机会参加萨达尔·穆罕默德·达乌德首相殿下的这个隆 重盛大的宴会，感到十分荣幸和愉快。我愿意借这个机会对不远千里而来的阿富汗贵宾们再一次表示衷心的感谢。
    中国人民和阿富汗人民，同其他亚非各国人民一样，都热爱和平。我们的共同愿望是在和平的环境中建设我们各自的国家。今年年初，我和贺龙副总理访问阿富汗的时候，阿富汗人民的热情好客以及对中阿友好和世界和平的真诚愿望给我们留下了非常深刻的印象。
    阿富汗和中国是友好的邻邦，我们两国有悠久深厚的友谊。根据历史记载，我们两国人民远自公元前就已经有了友谊的交往。著名的中国旅行家法显和以后的中国著名学者玄奘都曾经带着中国人民的友谊访问过阿富汗。阿富汗人在很早的日子里也曾经到中国作过友好访问。连接着我们两国边疆的“丝绸之路”印下了中阿两国人民长期的友好足迹。的确，在过去的接触当中，如同首相殿下所曾经说过的，我们的关系从来没有被分歧和恶感所损害。在我们之间只有友谊和亲善的记录。我们的这种古老的友谊今天不仅得到恢复而且有了进一步的发展。现在首相殿下又做为阿富汗的友谊使者来到了我国，使我们格外高兴。我们相信，通过首相殿下的这次访问，中阿两国人民的古老而又年青的友谊将一定会大大地加强起来。
    在首相殿下逗留北京的期间，我们曾经有机会在友好热诚的空气中进行交谈，并且就中阿两国共同关心的问题取得了一致的意见。通过这些意见的交流，我们相互间有了进一步的了解和信任。明天，尊敬的贵宾们就要离开我国的首都前往我国各地参观访问。我相信，贵宾们在中国各地访问期间将会继续看到中国人民对贵宾们的真挚感情和崇高敬意。
    我愿意在此再一次祝中阿两国人民的友谊不断地巩固和发展！
    我提议：
    为亚洲和世界的和平，
    为中阿两国人民的友谊，
    为阿富汗国家繁荣，人民幸福，
    为萨达尔·穆罕默德·达乌德首相殿下的健康，
    为穆罕默德·查希尔国王陛下的健康，
    干杯！
