Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 4th—Many agricultural cooperatives in Guangdong Province are improving their work while simultaneously rectifying and changing amidst the great blooming and great contention. The opinions raised by the members of these agricultural cooperatives are classified and prioritized, and those that are correct and can be resolved immediately are resolved immediately.

The majority of these opinions relate to production, welfare, and the work style of cadres. Members of the Xinhe Agricultural Cooperative in Wenchang County criticized the cooperative for starting land reclamation work but not finishing it, and for not publicizing the accounts. The cooperative committee accepted this opinion and reorganized the labor force, ensuring that more than 100 people were sent to reclaim land and plant cash crops every day; the cooperative's financial team also developed a financial notification form, deciding to notify each household of the accounts and publish them monthly thereafter. The Qin Huangxiang Agricultural Cooperative in Qingyuan County, based on the opinions of members regarding sideline production, transferred full-time cadres and some members to engage in sideline production such as charcoal burning and rope making. In just over ten days, the income exceeded 18,000 yuan. Many agricultural cooperatives in the Zhanjiang Special Zone accepted the opinion of members that "how can we talk about improving work if we don't do a good job in normal production?" They achieved a balance between blooming and contention and current normal production. Many cooperatives first arranged production before blooming and contention, and then improved production by correcting members' mistaken understandings of production through debate. Some agricultural cooperatives also adjusted the amount of private plots according to the opinions of members.

Basic-level financial and economic units in some parts of Guangdong Province also pay attention to accepting correct opinions from members to improve work. For example, according to farmers' opinions, they increased the number of edible oil supply points, supply and marketing cooperatives are open in the morning and evening, and retail pharmaceutical departments should also take care of patients buying medicines during holidays. Individual cadres with inadequate service attitudes have taken the initiative to apologize to farmers.

### 广东不少农业社  在大鸣大争中改进工作

    广东不少农业社
    在大鸣大争中改进工作
    新华社广州4日电　广东省不少农业社在大鸣大放大争中边整边改。这些农业社社员提出的意见分类排队，对于正确而又可以马上解决的便立即加以解决。
    这些意见大部分是有关生产、生活福利和干部作风等方面。文昌县新合农业社社员批评了社里垦荒工作有头无尾，账目又不公布的缺点。社委会接受这个意见，便重新组织劳动力，做到每天派一百多人去垦荒和种经济作物；社的财务小组也制订了财务通知书，决定将账通知到户，以后逐月公布。清远县秦皇乡农业社根据社员对副业生产的意见，抽调了专职干部和一部分社员搞了烧炭、搓牛绳等副业生产，仅十多天内收入就有一万八千多元。湛江专区许多农业社接受社员“不管好正常生产怎谈得上改进工作”的意见，做到了鸣放和当前正常生产两不误，许多社都在鸣放之前首先安排生产，又通过争辩端正社员对生产的错误认识来改进生产。还有些农业社根据社员的意见调整了自留地的数量。
    广东省部分地方的基层财经单位也注意接受社员正确意见改进工作。例如根据农民意见增设食油供应点，供销社早晚都营业，医药零售部门在休假时也要照顾病人买药。个别服务态度不够好的干部主动地向农民作了检讨。
