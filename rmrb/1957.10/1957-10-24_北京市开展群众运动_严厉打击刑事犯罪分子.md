Beijing has launched a widespread mass movement against criminal offenses in recent months, achieving good results.

The Beijing Intermediate People's Court and the People's Courts of various districts inside and outside the city have held sentencing rallies with hundreds or thousands of people participating multiple times, sentencing one hundred and sixty-two criminal offenders. Among them, ten criminals with extremely serious crimes were sentenced to death. Some public security sub-bureaus also held mass rallies to publicly arrest some criminals. At the same time, various districts have also universally held mass meetings, symposiums, roving exhibitions, etc., to conduct publicity and education on cracking down on criminal offenses to the broad masses. So far, more than 4,000 meetings have been held. Some factories, mines, and schools have also carried out publicity among workers and staff on fighting criminal offenses in connection with the public handling of criminal offenses. Through the above work, a total of more than 600,000 people have received publicity and education.

This mass movement has cracked down on the arrogance of criminal elements and supported the just demands of the masses. The masses warmly support the government's measures. The vigilance and enthusiasm of the masses in cracking down on criminal offenses have also been greatly improved. Many people actively reported criminal elements to the public security organs. During this period, the public security organs received more than 3,000 pieces of reporting materials, and more than 100 cases were investigated and verified. Among the theft cases solved by the East Suburb Public Security Bureau in September, twenty-six were reported by the masses. After vendor Zhang Gui saw the exhibition of evidence of criminal offenses, he discovered that a temporary worker, Lü Dehai, was molesting a young girl on September 8 and immediately twisted Lü to the police station. Among the criminal cases solved by the Nan Yuan Public Security Bureau in August, nine were solved with the strong assistance of the masses.

After the serious handling and publicity crackdown on criminal elements, the criminal elements were greatly shaken. Some confessed their crimes to the public security police station after participating in the rally to pronounce sentences on criminal offenders. Some voluntarily requested labor re-education from the public security organs, expressing repentance and a desire to start anew. A worker in a joint state-private sauce garden stole another worker's watch. After hearing the publicity, he returned the watch to the original owner and confessed his theft to the factory director.

At present, the relevant departments in various districts are continuing to carry out publicity work on cracking down on criminal elements.

    北京市开展群众运动
    严厉打击刑事犯罪分子
    本报讯　最近几个月以来，北京市展开了一个广泛的反对刑事犯罪的群众运动，获得了良好效果。
    北京市中级法院和城内外各区人民法院，多次召开有几百、几千群众参加的宣判大会，对一百六十二个刑事犯罪分子判了刑。其中罪行极端严重的十名罪犯判处了死刑。有的公安分局还召开群众大会，当众逮捕了一些犯罪分子。与此同时，各区还普遍地召开群众会，举行座谈会、巡回展览会等，向广大群众进行了打击刑事犯罪的宣传教育。到目前为止，已经召开过四千多个会。有的厂矿和学校也结合对刑事犯罪的公开处理，在职工群众中开展了同刑事犯罪作斗争的宣传。通过以上各方面的工作，受到宣传教育的群众共约六十多万人次。
    这一群众运动，打击了刑事犯罪分子的气焰，支持了群众的正义要求。群众热烈拥护政府的措施。群众的警惕性和打击刑事犯罪的积极性也大大提高了。不少人积极地向公安机关检举刑事犯罪分子。这一时期，公安机关共收到检举材料三千多件，并从中经调查证实破案百余起。东郊公安分局9月份破获的偷窃案件中有二十六起是群众检举的。小贩张贵看了刑事犯罪分子罪证展览后，9月8日发现临时工吕德海猥亵幼女，即将吕扭送到派出所。南苑公安分局8月份所破获的刑事案件中，有九件是群众大力协助破案的。
    经过严肃处理和宣传打击刑事犯罪分子后，刑事犯罪分子震动很大。有的参加了宣判刑事犯罪分子的大会以后，到公安派出所交代了罪行。有的自动向公安机关要求劳动教养，表示悔改，从新作人。一个公私合营酱园工人，偷了另一工人的表，听了宣传以后，把表送还原主，并向厂长坦白了偷窃行为。
    目前，各区有关部门对打击刑事犯罪分子的宣传工作还在继续进行。
