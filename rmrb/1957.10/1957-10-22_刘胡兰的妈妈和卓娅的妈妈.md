    Liu Hulan's Mother and Zoya's Mother
    Xinhua News Agency Reporter, Shui Tiansheng
    In Yunzhou West Village, Shanxi Province, the hometown of martyr Liu Hulan, the flowers of Sino-Soviet friendship are in full bloom. Here, the farmers spread stories of Sino-Soviet friendship and remember their distant Soviet friends.
    Recently, when I visited Hu Wenxiu, the mother of the martyr, at "Liu Hulan's Home," she happily took out a letter from Zoya's mother from the bottom of her chest. The letter read: "I see and feel every day the Chinese people's friendship with the Soviet Union. The friendship between our two peoples guarantees lasting world peace... Please accept my heartfelt, fraternal greetings as a mother—whose children dedicated their young lives to the motherland for peace and justice—and from all the Soviet people to the Chinese people."
    Hu Wenxiu told me that she loves to read this letter and cherish it, because it comes from the Soviet people and contains the words of Zoya's mother, who, like Hulanzi, was steadfast in the face of the enemy.
    Mother Hu will never forget the profound moments she shared with the Soviet people. She is grateful for the Soviet friends' admiration for Liu Hulan and their love for the Chinese people. This past January, before the youth of Shanxi Province commemorated the tenth anniversary of Liu Hulan's sacrifice in Yunzhou West Village, Soviet friends traveled a long way to Yunzhou West Village to participate in the commemoration. To express her gratitude, Mother Hu gave several movie stills of Liu Hulan's martyrdom to the Soviet friends as souvenirs. Just a few days ago, more Soviet friends came from afar to visit Yunzhou West Village. They paid their respects at the Martyrs' Cemetery and laid flowers in front of the martyr's tomb. They also gave blooming flowers to Hu Wenxiu and took pictures with Liu Hulan's entire family as a memento. Here, Chinese and Soviet friends gathered and talked, constantly raising their glasses to toast the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people.
    Mother Hu remembers the words of a Soviet friend: China has Liu Hulan, and the Soviet Union has Zoya. Their deaths were all for liberation, freedom, and communism. They hated the enemy and loved the people. The unity of the Chinese and Soviet people will defeat the enemy and build a happier life.
    The farmers of Yunzhou West Village have all established deep friendships with their Soviet friends. In the home of farmer Shi Jinhua, I saw five photos. These photos were taken when Soviet expert Pavlov visited Yunzhou West Village at the end of July this year and posed with Liu Hulan's mother, sister, and Shi Jinhua. Shi Jinhua carefully placed these photos in a frame. Pointing to Pavlov in the photo, he said that he is the "old brother" of our family, the "uncle" of the children, and a good friend of the farmers in Yunzhou West Village.
    Now, the farmers of Yunzhou West Village are beginning the celebration of the fortieth anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution with great joy. To thank the Soviet people for their selfless assistance to China, they have all expressed their determination to carry out socialist ideological education work, learn from the Soviet Union's advanced agricultural experience, and sell more than one million jin of surplus grain to the state as a gift to celebrate the holiday. At the same time, they will launch a Sino-Soviet friendship propaganda week and hold various celebratory activities.

    刘胡兰的妈妈和卓娅的妈妈
    新华社记者　水天生
    在刘胡兰烈士的家乡山西省云周西村，中苏友谊的花朵盛开。在这里，农民们传颂着中苏友好的故事，遥念着远在苏联的友人。
    最近，记者在“刘胡兰之家”访问烈士的母亲胡文秀时，她满面喜悦地从箱底翻出了一封卓娅的母亲寄给她的信。这封信写道：“我看到并且每天都感到中国人民对苏联的友谊，我们两国人民之间的友谊联系保证了世界的持久和平……请接受我这个母亲——儿女们把自己年轻的生命献给祖国为和平和正义而奋斗的母亲和所有苏联人民对中国人民衷心地、兄弟般的问候。”
    胡文秀告诉我，她爱读这封信，珍惜这封信。因为它来自苏联人民，它上面写着和胡兰子一样在敌人面前坚贞不屈的卓娅的母亲的话。
    胡妈妈忘不了她和苏联人民相处的情意深长的时刻。她感激苏联友人对刘胡兰的敬仰和对中国人民的热爱。今年1月，山西省各地青年在云周西村纪念刘胡兰烈士牺牲十周年的前夕，苏联朋友曾长程来云周西村参加纪念。为了表示感激，胡妈妈把几张刘胡兰烈士就义的电影照片送给苏联友人作纪念。就在前几天，又有苏联友人不远千里而来访问了云周西村，他们瞻仰了烈士陵园，在烈士墓前献了花。他们还把盛开的鲜花送给胡文秀，和刘胡兰烈士的全家在一起拍照留念。在这里，中苏两国朋友欢聚座谈，并不断地端起酒杯，为中苏两国人民友谊干杯。
    胡妈妈牢记着一位苏联朋友的话：中国有刘胡兰，苏联有卓娅，她们的死都是为了解放、自由和共产主义，她们恨敌人，爱人民，中苏两国的人民的团结，就能战胜敌人，建设更加幸福的生活。
    云周西村的农民们都和苏联朋友结下了深厚的友谊。记者在农民石锦华的家里看到了五张照片，这些照片是苏联专家巴甫洛夫今年7月底来云周西村参观时，和刘胡兰的母亲、妹妹、石锦华在一起合拍的。石锦华小心地把这些照片装在镜框里。他指着照片上的巴甫洛夫说，他是我们家庭里的老大哥，孩子们的叔父，云周西村农民的好朋友。
    现在，云周西村的农民们正以万分欢乐的心情开始了庆祝十月社会主义革命四十周年的纪念活动。他们为了感谢苏联人民对中国的无私援助，都表示要以做好社会主义思想教育工作、学习苏联农业先进经验，卖给国家余粮百万余斤的实际行动，作为庆祝节日的献礼。同时，要开展一个中苏友好的宣传周，举行各项庆祝活动。
