Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 7th: While visiting Japan, Indian Prime Minister Nehru, during a press conference held in Tokyo today, spoke about the diplomatic policies of Japan and India. He acknowledged that there are certain differences between the two countries, considering this a natural thing. He said that India recognizes China, but it does not want to influence Japan's position of not recognizing China. He felt that it was impolite to tell others what to do.

During a television interview last night, Nehru discussed the relationship between Japan, China, and India. He said that these three countries are major powers in Asia, and they must find ways to develop relations, because what they do will have an impact on Asia and even the whole world.

He also said on television that he did not like people using the term "neutral" to talk about India's foreign policy, believing that "neutral" is passive, and passivity is not a virtue. He said he was a man of action and that he wanted India to be active, but peaceful.

Nehru and Japanese Foreign Minister Aiichiro Fujiyama determined during their talks yesterday that on October 8 they would discuss some specific issues between the two countries. It is said that the discussion will focus on economic and cultural cooperation between Japan and India, and activities in the United Nations. The agreements reached in the discussion will be specifically stated in the joint communique to be issued at the end of Nehru's visit.

    尼赫鲁主张发展中印日关系
    据新华社7日讯　东京消息：正在日本进行访问的印度总理尼赫鲁今天在东京举行的记者招待会上谈到日本和印度的外交政策的时候，承认两国有某些不同的地方，他认为这是自然的事。他说，印度承认了中国，但是它并不想影响日本的不承认中国的立场。他认为告诉别人怎么做是不礼貌的。
    在昨天晚上的一次电视访问谈话中，尼赫鲁谈到了日本、中国和印度的关系问题。他说，这三个国家是亚洲主要大国，它们必须设法发展关系，因为它们所要做的事情将对亚洲以至对全世界发生影响。
    他还在电视中谈到他不喜欢人们用“中立”这个名辞来谈论印度的外交政策，他认为“中立”是消极的，消极并不是一种美德。他说他是一个讲究行动的人，他希望印度是积极的，但是和平的。
    尼赫鲁和日本外务相藤山爱一郎在昨天的会谈中确定，10月8日他们将讨论两国间的一些具体问题，据说讨论将集中在日本和印度在经济、文化方面的合作和在联合国的活动等问题上。讨论中所达成的协议将在尼赫鲁访问结束时发表的联合公报中特别说明。
