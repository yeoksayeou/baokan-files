In the midst of rectification and improvement, nearly half of the management personnel of the Beijing Qinghe Woolen Mill have been transferred to become workers. The first group of forty cadres who were transferred have already begun working, and the second group of thirty-one cadres were assigned to workshops on October 8th. They will become technical personnel with both technical theory and practical experience. After the streamlining of the factory's organization, the original twelve departments will be merged into five. Because the departments throughout the factory are now concentrated, leadership and command are more timely, flexible, and unified, which greatly helps improve work efficiency.

Song Yunsheng and Zhang Xiangfu (second and third from the left) were originally technicians and are now maintenance workers in the workshop. This is them with veteran workers, retrofitting a spinning frame.

Factory Director Zhao Yu personally goes to the workshop to grasp the production situation and solve production problems. This is him discussing with the workers of the long-pile plush work area about improving machine equipment and improving workers' working conditions.

　　清河制呢厂干部当工人
    正在边整边改的北京清河制呢厂，已有将近一半管理人员下放当工人，第一批下放干部四十人，已开始工作，第二批下放干部三十一人也在10月8日下达车间。他们将要成为既有技术理论又有实际经验的技术人才。全厂紧缩机构以后，原有的十二个科室，将合并成为五个科。因为全厂科室集中，使领导指挥更及时、灵活和统一，大大有利于提高工作效率。　　新华社记者　楚英摄

    厂长赵钰亲自下车间掌握生产情况，解决生产上的问题。这是他与长毛绒工区的职工研究改进机器装置，改善工人劳动条件。
