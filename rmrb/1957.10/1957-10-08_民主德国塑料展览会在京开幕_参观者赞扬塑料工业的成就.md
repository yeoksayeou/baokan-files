The Vice-Premier of the German Democratic Republic, Ölsner, the Vice-Premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China, Bo Yibo, and the Ambassador of the German Democratic Republic to China, Gipner, attended the opening ceremony.

Ambassador Gipner said at the opening ceremony that this plastics exhibition was held to promote the development of unity and friendship between Germany and China. The German Democratic Republic can and is always willing to provide scientific and technical assistance to China in developing its plastics industry.

Nan Hanchen, Chairman of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, said in his speech that the plastics exhibition held by the German Democratic Republic is a school where we can learn a lot.

Ambassador Gipner cut the ribbon for the opening of the exhibition. After the ribbon-cutting, the Vice-Premier of the German Democratic Republic, Ölsner, and Ambassador Gipner accompanied Bo Yibo and others on a tour of the exhibition.

Also attending the opening ceremony were Norbert, Commercial Counselor of the Embassy of the German Democratic Republic in China, Hartlieb, head of the delegation of the German Democratic Republic Plastics Exhibition, and all members of the delegation.

Guests attending the ceremony included Peng Tao, Minister of the Chemical Industry, and Lei Renmin, Vice Minister of Foreign Trade.

Xinhua News Agency, 7th: All the guests who attended the opening ceremony of the German Democratic Republic Plastics Exhibition visited the exhibition this morning.

People first visited the plastics chemistry section. The exhibits here introduced to the audience how ordinary raw materials such as coal, lime, and wood are transformed into various semi-finished plastic products and a wide variety of plastic products through different treatments.

Entering the hall of the plastics application section, people were immediately attracted by the dazzling array of plastic exhibits. Here are precision instruments made of plastic, optical instruments, various industrial protective equipment, daily necessities, various medical equipment, and bearings for large rolling mills made of plastic. A human skeleton shows the audience that plexiglass made of plastic can be used to make artificial bones and orthopedic materials.

The audience was particularly interested in the P70 small sedan body made of plastic. Hartlieb, the head of the exhibition delegation, told the audience that this type of car can not only save steel, but also the body is about 70% lighter than ordinary cars, and even if five people stand on the car roof, it will not crush it.

When people visited the plastic processing section, the technicians of the exhibition delegation started several machines and demonstrated the production process of some plastic products. Someone put a spoonful of red powder into an automatic die-casting machine, and in just one and a half minutes it turned into a sturdy and beautiful large bowl.

The visitors highly praised the achievements of the German Democratic Republic in the plastics industry. (Attached picture)

    参观者赞扬塑料工业的成就
    据新华社7日讯　德意志民主共和国塑料展览会今天在北京苏联展览馆文化馆开幕。开幕仪式在上午十点钟举行。
    德意志民主共和国副总理厄斯纳，中华人民共和国国务院副总理薄一波和德意志民主共和国驻中国大使纪普纳参加了开幕典礼。
    纪普纳大使在开幕典礼上说，这个塑料展览会是为了促进德、中两国的团结和友谊的发展而举办的。民主德国对中国发展塑料工业方面，可以并且随时愿意提供科学和技术方面的援助。
    中国国际贸易促进委员会主席南汉宸在讲话中说，这次民主德国举办的塑料展览会，是一所使我们能获得教益的学校。
    展览会由纪普纳大使剪彩。剪彩以后，德意志民主共和国副总理厄斯纳和纪普纳大使陪同薄一波等人参观了展览会。
    今天参加开幕典礼的还有德意志民主共和国驻中国大使馆商务参赞诺伯特、德意志民主共和国塑料展览会代表团团长哈脱里勃和代表团的全体人员。
    参加典礼的来宾有化学工业部部长彭涛、对外贸易部副部长雷任民等。
    据新华社7日讯　参加民主德国塑料展览会开幕仪式的全体来宾，今天上午参观了这个展览会。
    人们首先参观了塑料化学部分。这里的展品向观众介绍普通的煤、石灰和木材等原料，经过不同的处理，怎样变成了各种塑料的半成品和各式各样的塑料制品。
    进入展览塑料应用部分的大厅，人们立即被琳琅满目的塑料制成的展览品吸引住了。这里有用塑料制成的精密仪器，光学仪器，各种工业防护用具，日用品，各种医疗设备和用塑料制成的大型轧钢机的轴承等。一副人体骨架向观众表明，用塑料制成的有机玻璃可以做假骨和整容器材。
    观众对于用塑料制成的P70型小卧车车身特别有兴趣。展览会代表团团长哈脱里勃对观众说，这种汽车不仅可以节省钢材，而且车身比一般汽车轻70％左右，即使有五个人站在车篷上，也不会把它压坏。
    当人们参观塑料加工部分的时候，展览会代表团的技术人员开动好几部机器，表演了部分塑料制品的生产过程。有人把一杓红色粉末放进自动压铸机里，只用一分半钟的时间就变成了一个坚固美观的大碗。
    参观的人们非常称赞民主德国在塑料工业方面的成就。（附图片）
