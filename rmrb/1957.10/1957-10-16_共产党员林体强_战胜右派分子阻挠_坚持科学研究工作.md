Communist Party Member Lin Tiqiang
    Overcomes Obstruction from Rightists and Persists in Scientific Research
    Lin Tiqiang, an assistant researcher and Communist Party member in the Agricultural Implement Department of the East China Agricultural Science Institute, broke through the numerous obstacles erected by rightist elements such as Jiang Yao, the director of the Agricultural Implement Department of the institute, and further researched and improved the rice transplanter. The structure of this transplanter is simpler than the original, and its performance is also better after paddy field testing.
    Lin Tiqiang's research work was carried out in the struggle against Zhou Shilu, the deputy director of the Agricultural Science Institute and a rightist, and Jiang Yao, the director of the Agricultural Implement Department. Lin Tiqiang had already successfully designed a rice transplanter in 1956, which was then stolen by these two rightists, who claimed it was their design. Lin Tiqiang did not argue with them, but still devoted himself to further improving the transplanter. These two rightists then added all kinds of obstacles. However, with the support of the Party, Lin Tiqiang persisted in his research work and finally succeeded in trial-manufacturing this rice transplanter with even better performance. (Attached picture)

　　共产党员林体强
    战胜右派分子阻挠　坚持科学研究工作
    华东农业科学研究所农具系助理研究员、共产党员林体强，冲破了该所农具系主任右派分子蒋耀等人的重重阻碍，进一步研究改进了水稻插秧机，这架插秧机构造较原来的简单，经水田试验，性能也较好。
    林体强的这项研究工作是在同农业科学研究所副所长、右派分子周拾禄和农具系主任蒋耀的斗争中进行的。林体强在1956年就设计成功了一架插秧机，当时被这两个右派分子所窃取，说是他们设计的。林体强并不同他们计较，仍然埋头于这架插秧机进一步改进的研究工作，这两个右派分子又加以百般阻挠。但在党的支持下，林体强坚持研究工作，终于试制成功了这架性能更为良好的水稻插秧机。（附图片）
