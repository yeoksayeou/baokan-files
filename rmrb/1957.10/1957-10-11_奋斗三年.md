　　Three Years of Hard Work
　　Xingfeng Cooperative's Production and Living Standards Exceed Those of Prosperous Middle Peasants
　　In Anshang Village, Xinghuacun Township, Fenyang County, Shanxi Province, there is the Xingfeng Agricultural Cooperative with 134 households. Last year, the total output value of this cooperative increased by more than double compared to 1955, and its production and living standards have surpassed those of prosperous middle peasants. Each labor day was worth 1.88 yuan, and the average income per person was 135 yuan. Except for two households with fewer laborers and more family members who earned 3 to 5 yuan less, the remaining 132 households all increased their income.
　　Perseverance
　　Victory is achieved through arduous struggle. As early as the autumn of 1952, this village, led by the current cooperative director Wu Zengrui and branch secretary Wei Chengye, established mutual aid teams. In the spring of 1954, it was officially built into a primary cooperative with 32 households. The members were poor and lower-middle peasants. The cooperative of 32 households didn't even have a chaff cutter; many things had to be borrowed from individual farmers. In the spring, they lacked livestock for plowing, so they had to pull the plows themselves. The prosperous households laughed at them, saying, "At home, you are pigs and dogs (eating poorly), and in the fields, you are livestock (pulling plows)." They mustered their energy to show the individual farmers what they could do. The cooperative frequently conducted education on the two roads, and everyone went out early and returned late, not even taking a midday break during the hottest days of summer.
　　During the wheat harvest, it was as tense as snatching food from a tiger's mouth. Individual farmers tried to lure cooperative members to harvest wheat for them: "Harvest wheat for us! The wage is one and a half dou (of wheat), and there will be enough wine and meat." Some people thought about earning cash outside the cooperative. At this critical moment, Party and Youth League members united and conducted ideological education among the members. Households with relatively better living conditions voluntarily offered grain to help each other, ensuring the completion of the summer harvest task.
　　The prosperous households outside the cooperative were waiting for them to "fight over steamed buns" after the autumn harvest. However, the agricultural cooperative increased production that year, with grain yields per mu exceeding individual farmers by 20 jin. They bought three mules and a large cart, and the number of households in the cooperative expanded from the original 32 to 82. In 1955, they opened two irrigation canals, capable of irrigating 501 mu of land, and also dug 40 dry wells. Digging dry wells was another ideological struggle. At the time, some old men couldn't understand, saying, "What's the point of digging these latrine pits!" But after the dry wells were dug, the water for composting fertilizer and applying pesticides no longer had to be carried from the 26-zhang-deep drinking water well in the village. Everyone saw the benefits, and each team requested to dig more dry wells. They also built a reservoir to provide water for the sheep. That year, they also carried out sideline production of burning lime and quarrying stone based on the principles of low cost, high returns, and relying on the mountains for sustenance. Although they encountered a severe drought that year, they still increased production. Grain yields per mu exceeded the village average by 7%.
　　In the spring of 1956, during the high tide of collectivization, all but three farmer households in the village joined the agricultural cooperative, which was also transformed into an advanced cooperative.
　　Careful Calculation
　　What was the starting capital of the Xingfeng Agricultural Cooperative?
　　First, running the cooperative diligently and thriftily.
　　Anshang Village has more land than labor, with an average of more than eight mu of land per person. Every year during the busy seasons of wheat and autumn harvests, there is a particular shortage of labor. After collectivization, even more careful farming was required, and the labor required per mu increased from the past four to seven. On the one hand, this cooperative utilized the role of women's labor, and at the same time, based on the past habits of diligent farming by old farmers, they proposed the slogan "Don't run empty on the way to the fields; carry out manure and bring back grass" when delivering fertilizer. Last autumn and this spring, they carried a total of 200,000 jin of manure to the fields, saving a total of 100 labor days and 200 livestock labor days, calculated at 1,200 jin per donkey load. That year, they also added two cart roads. In the past, only 20% of the village's land was accessible by cart; this year, 80% of the land is accessible by cart. This change alone saved more than 1,120 labor days. Last summer and autumn harvest, not only did they not hire short-term laborers, but they also completed the harvest earlier than in the past.
　　The people of Xingfeng Cooperative have never set up a large stall or made a show of it. They calculate carefully in everything they do. Their principle is: save where you can, don't buy new things if you have old ones, and use them by repairing and patching them up. Last year, when buying livestock, the cooperative cadres were considering buying more cattle, but the young people disagreed. They advocated adding mules and horses, large draft animals. After calculating the accounts, the price of cattle was cheaper, their strength was greater, and they saved on feed, so the young people understood. However, what the cooperative bought back were half-grown calves that had not yet matured. The young people thought it was wrong to buy such inconspicuous things. More than a year later, the cattle grew up and were fat and strong, and the young people's tone also changed. They said, "These cattle wouldn't be sold for 200 yuan." The cooperative cadres not only kept a close eye on large expenses, but also on small expenses. This spring, the shaft of a horse-drawn cart broke, and the members asked to make a new one, but the cooperative cadres repaired it themselves, saving money and still being able to use the cart as usual. Once, the inner tube of a coal-hauling rubber-wheeled cart lost air, and the outer tube was rusted together with the wheel and couldn't be taken apart. It would cost ten yuan to repair it at the repair shop and would take ten days, but they bought five jin of kerosene and soaked it for a day, took it apart, and repaired it themselves, saving money and not delaying production. This summer, more than 100 brooms were needed for the wheat harvest, at one yuan per broom. They thought it was too expensive and didn't buy them, but organized members to go up the mountain to cut "rattan" and tied 78 brooms, costing only 25 cents per broom.
　　Democratic Management
　　Second, cadres participate in labor production, lead by example, act impartially, and endure hardship before enjoying comfort.
　　The cadres of Xingfeng Cooperative have always participated in labor. Last year, the cooperative director worked 150 labor days, the branch secretary worked 110 labor days, and even the deputy director worked at least 90 labor days. This year, they studied the three notices on democratic cooperative management issued by the Central Committee and the State Council, and their thinking became clearer. So far, apart from the accountant and cashier who have worked fewer labor days due to heavy workloads, the cooperative director and village branch secretary have already worked more than 100 labor days. They regard participating in field production as an important leadership method. By doing so, they not only strengthened their relationship with the members, but also gained the praise of the masses in neighboring villages.
　　The cooperative cadres are not economically well-off, and some are quite poor, but they have never misappropriated a single penny from the cooperative over the years. The accountant said, "Our cooperative cadres are clean-handed and do not touch money." Even in handling some specific matters, the cooperative cadres have set an example. For example, when distributing melons, there were not enough melons to go around, so the cooperative cadres took the lead in not taking any, and the members who did not get any melons did not complain.
　　Third, financial transparency.
　　Since April of last year, accounts have been announced every month, except for two months. Based on the characteristics of the small cooperative and the small number of literate people, they adopted the method of reading the accounts aloud. At first, everything was read, but later they implemented the "Member Economic Transaction Handbook," and the number of items announced was reduced. Each time, it could be read in more than an hour, which the members were very satisfied with.
　　Fourth, consulting with the masses on everything.
　　In the process of carrying out production reforms, basic construction, and business management, the cooperative cadres fully promoted democracy and consulted with the masses. As for some major ideological issues, they also adopted the method of mass self-education. For example, this spring, some members complained that they didn't have enough grain to eat, and some suggested eating livestock feed grain. The management committee members also had different opinions. The cadres first investigated the situation of the masses. It turned out that only a dozen households really didn't have enough grain to eat, while thirty or forty households complained of not having enough grain; some members didn't have grain but had money. Based on this situation, the Party branch and the cooperative management committee first unified their thinking and then convened a member meeting to discuss the issue. They criticized the thinking of some members who did not lack grain but wanted the state to supply grain, and helped the few members who really lacked grain to overcome their difficulties.
　　After living conditions improved, the members' enthusiasm for labor greatly increased, but some members began to develop a slackening mentality. Some people, after having money, only cared about the present and not the future. When they got sick, died, or encountered difficulties, they only knew to ask the cooperative for money.
　　If these problems are not resolved, they will still affect the consolidation and improvement of the cooperative. The Party branch and cooperative leadership intend to solve the problem from two aspects. On the one hand, they will formulate a five-year production plan. In addition to further increasing agricultural production, they will also plan to develop animal husbandry and plant a large number of fruit trees and forests, so that members will have more "hope" in their understanding and production. On the other hand, they will continue to strengthen political and ideological work, so that members will understand the relationship between individuals and collectives, industry and agriculture, and further establish the atmosphere of hard work, thrift in managing households, and thrift in running cooperatives.

　　奋斗三年
    杏丰社生产生活水平超过富裕中农
    山西汾阳县杏花村乡的安上村，有一个一百三十四户的杏丰农业社。这个社去年总产值比1955年增加了一倍多，在生产和生活水平上已经超过了富裕中农，每个劳动日分到一元八角八，每人平均收入一百三十五元，全社除了两户因为人多劳力少减少三、五元的收入外，其余一百三十二户，户户增收。
    坚持
    胜利是经过艰苦斗争得来的。远在1952年的秋后，这个村由现在的社主任武增瑞和分支部书记魏成叶领导建立了互助组，1954年春天就正式建成了一个三十二户的初级社。参加社的是些贫农、下中农，三十二户的社连一把铡刀都没有，许多东西还得向单干户去借用。春天种地缺牲口，只好人拉犁。富裕户笑他们是：“回家是猪狗（吃的不好），下地是牲口（人拉犁）。”他们就鼓着一股子劲，要给单干户做个样子看看。社内经常进行两条道路的教育，大家早出晚归，连三伏天都不歇晌午。
    收麦的时候，好像从虎口夺食一样的紧张，单干户拉社员给他们割麦子：“给我们割麦子吧！工钱一斗半（麦子），酒肉管够。”有的人想到社外去挣现钱。在这个紧张的关头，党、团员首先团结一致，在社员中间进行了思想教育，生活比较富裕的户自动拿出粮食来互相接济，保证了夏收任务的完成。
    社外富裕户等着他们秋后“吵包子”，但是，这一年农业社却增了产，粮食每亩产量超过单干户二十斤。买了三头骡子，一辆大车，合作社的户数也从原来的三十二户扩大到八十二户。1955年开了两道水渠，可以灌溉五百零一亩地，还打了四十眼旱井。打旱井又是一场思想斗争，当时有些老汉思想不通，说：“你们打这毛坑口顶甚么事哩！”但是旱井打成之后，沤粪、施药剂用水都不用到村里二十六丈深的吃水井去担了。大家都看到了好处，各队都要求多打些旱井。还修了一个蓄水池，给羊喝水。这一年，还根据成本小、收获大、靠山吃山的原则进行了烧石灰、打石头的副业生产。那年虽然遇到严重的旱灾，他们还是增了产。粮食每亩产量超过全村平均每亩产量7％。
    1956年春天，在合作化高潮当中，全村农民除了三户以外，都加入了农业社，而且也转成了高级社。
    精打细算
    杏丰农业社起家的本钱是什么呢？
    第一是勤俭办社。
    安上村地多劳力少，每人平均八亩多地。历年在收麦收秋的大忙季节，劳力就特别不够用。合作化以后还要精耕细作，每亩地需工由过去的四个增加到七个。这个社一方面发挥妇女劳力的作用，同时根据过去老农勤劳耕作的习惯，在送粪的时候提出“上地不空跑、担出粪、捎回草”的口号，去秋和今春共往地捎粪二十万斤，以每头驴驮一千二百斤计算，共省人工一百个，牲口工二百个。当年还增修了两条车路，过去全村只有20％的地通车，今年有80％的地通车，这一项改变就节省一千一百二十多个工。去年夏收，秋收不但没请短工，而且都比过去提前完成。
    杏丰社的人们一直没有摆大摊子，闹排场，凡事都精打细算。他们的原则是：能省就省，有旧的不买新的，修修补补对付着用。去年买牲口的时候，社干部计算着多买几头牛，青年们不同意，他们主张添骡马大耕畜，经过算账，牛价便宜，力气大，又省饲料，青年们想通了。但是，社里买回的是还没有长成的半大小牛，青年们认为不该买这种不起眼的东西。一年多以后，牛长大了，吃的肥胖满膘，青年们的话头也变了，他们说：“这牛二百元也不卖”。社干部不仅大的开支抓得紧，就是一些小的开支也抓得很紧。今年春天，一辆马车的车杆子坏了，社员要求做新的，社干部都亲自动手修理了起来，省了钱车还照常能使用。有一次拉煤的胶皮车里带跑了气，外带和车轮锈在一起拆不开，到车铺修理要花十块钱，还得等十天，结果他们自己买了五斤煤油泡了一天，拆开了也修好了，省钱不说，还没有耽误生产。今年夏天收麦子需要买一百多把扫帚，一把一元钱，他们嫌贵没有买，组织社员上山割“藤条”，捆了七十八把扫帚，每把只用二角五分钱。
    民主办社
    第二是干部参加劳动生产。以身作则，办事公正，吃苦在前，享受在后。
    杏丰社的干部历来就参加劳动，去年社主任做了劳动日一百五十个，支书做了一百一十个，副主任做的最少也有九十个。今年他们学习了中央和国务院发布的民主办社的三项通知，思想更明确了。到现在为止，除了会计和出纳因为业务繁重做的劳动日较少外，社主任和村支书都已经作了一百多个劳动日。他们把参加田间生产当成一种重要的领导方法。这样做，不仅密切了与社员的关系，也得到邻村群众的称赞。
    社干部经济并不宽裕，有的还相当困难，但是他们多年来从未挪用过社里一块钱。会计说：“我们社干部是两袖清风，不沾钱财。”就是在处理一些具体事情上，社干部也作出了榜样。例如分甜瓜时，瓜少户多，不够分配，社干部首先自己不分，分不到的社员也就不说话了。
    第三是财务公开。
    从去年4月份起，除了有两个月以外，月月都公布了账目。他们根据社小、识字的人又不多的特点，采用了念账的方法。开始全部念，后来推行了“社员经济来往手册”，宣布的项目减少了，每次有一个多钟头就可以念完，社员们很满意。
    第四是有事和群众商量。
    社干部在进行生产改革、基本建设、经营管理等工作过程中，充分发扬民主，和群众商量。至于一些重大思想问题，也采取群众自我教育的方法。譬如，今年春天有的社员闹粮食不够吃，有人提出要吃牲口饲料粮，社的管理委员们意见也不一致。干部们首先摸了一下群众的底。原来真正没粮吃的只有十来户，闹没粮吃的却有三、四十户；有的社员虽然没有粮但还有钱。党支部和社管委会根据这种情况，首先统一了思想认识，然后召开社员大会讨论这个问题。批判了某些社员不缺粮而要国家供应粮食的思想，并帮助真正缺粮的几户社员克服了缺粮的困难。
    生活改善以后，社员们的劳动积极性很高涨，但是，有的社员开始滋长了一种松劲思想。有些人有了钱只顾眼前，不顾将来。生了病、死了人、有了困难，光知道伸手向社要钱。
    这些问题不解决仍然会影响社的巩固和提高。党支部和社领导上打算从两方面来解决问题。一方面进行五年生产规划，除了进一步提高农业生产外，还要有计划地发展畜牧业和大量种植果树、林木，社员们认识上生产上更加有“奔头”。另一方面，继续加强政治思想工作，使社员们弄清个人和集体、工业和农业的关系，进一步树立艰苦奋斗、勤俭持家、勤俭办社的风气。
