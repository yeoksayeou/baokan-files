Changes in Two Years
　　——How the Mass Cooperative’s Production Surpassed the Level of Rich Middle Peasants
中共辽宁省辽阳地委第一书记　曾宇

　　The Mass Agricultural Cooperative of Yingkou County, Liaoning Province, can generally reflect certain common characteristics of the Liaonan economic crop area in terms of its scale and production (such as high population density, limited land, numerous specialty products, close integration of industry and agriculture, and a relatively high standard of living for the people). This cooperative was formed in 1954 by twenty-nine poor and lower-middle peasant households. After two years of expansion and mergers, a leap in production occurred after the realization of advanced cooperativization in the winter of 1955. Last year, the lives of the peasants had already caught up with the living standards of rich middle peasants.

　　I. 98% of Cooperative Members Have Caught Up with or Surpassed the Living Standards of Rich Middle Peasants

　　(1) This year, the total income of the Mass Agricultural Cooperative (calculated at 1956 constant prices) was 464,659.03 yuan, an increase of 5.6% compared to the bumper harvest of last year, 38.3% compared to 1955, and 278% compared to 1943, the best production year before liberation. This year, agricultural income accounted for 49.2% of the total production value, apple income accounted for 35.7%, sideline occupations accounted for 12.6%, animal husbandry accounted for 2.3%, and miscellaneous items accounted for 0.2%.

　　The changes in unit area yield of various field crops were also significant. This year, the standard set by the Forty Articles of Agriculture (Draft) for areas north of the Yellow River has been exceeded. The average yield per mu of grain crops was 647 jin (sorghum 800 jin, corn 610 jin, millet 456 jin, soybeans 338 jin), cotton yield was 280 jin per mu, and peanuts yield was 400 jin per mu. If the 1943 yield is taken as 100, this year's grain yield per mu is 162, cotton is 184, and peanuts are 400. At that time, apples accounted for only 2% of total income, but this year they accounted for 35.7% (1.66 million jin, with the proportion meeting export standards increasing to 61%).

　　With the development of production, the income of cooperative members has also continued to increase. This year, the estimated distribution to cooperative members is 344,686 yuan, an increase of 17% over last year. For 160,000 workdays, the value of each workday is 2.15 yuan, and the average annual income per person is 123.4 yuan. Including income from household sideline occupations (including manure prices, etc.), the average income per person is 157.43 yuan, and the average income per household is 790.37 yuan (taking 1943 income as 100, 1955 as 232, 1956 as 270, and 1957 as 329). From the perspective of income across different strata, the average income per person this year is: poor peasants 144 yuan, new lower-middle peasants 159 yuan, old lower-middle peasants 151 yuan, new upper-middle peasants 154 yuan, old upper-middle peasants 180 yuan, rich peasants 138 yuan, and landlords 141 yuan.

　　(2) What level has the peasants' lives improved to?

　　During the period from the autumn before last to the autumn harvest of this year, the main items purchased or consumed by the peasants included: 65,465 chi of cotton cloth, 1,805 pairs of rubber shoes, 872 pairs of leather shoes, 69 sheepskin jackets, 81 bicycles, 40 sewing machines (bicycles and sewing machines are cumulative for two years), 71 watches, 43,500 jin of rice, 94,000 jin of flour, and 71,900 jin of pork.

　　Currently, 437 out of the 446 households in the cooperative (accounting for 98% of the total households) are equivalent to or exceed the living standards of rich middle peasants, and the remaining nine households are also at the level of lower-middle peasants. One new middle peasant said, "To tell you the truth, even the rich peasant households of the past cannot compare to our lives today."

　　(3) Another important historical change is the increased capacity for expanded reproduction in the cooperative. The total public accumulation over the past three years is 80,000 yuan. The agricultural loans and credit loans borrowed before 1956, totaling more than 3,000 yuan, have been fully repaid. In 1957, relying on internal financial strength, the cooperative can completely rely on its own efforts to solve the needs of expanded reproduction. In 1955, there were a total of 86 draught animals. Last year, 15 horses were purchased, and another eight were purchased this spring. It is also planned to buy 13 more after the autumn harvest (so that each animal bears the burden of cultivating 25 mu of land), in addition to increasing 15 rubber-wheeled carts. The average amount of fertilizer applied per mu has increased by 75% compared to the rich middle peasants before cooperativization, and the unit area yield has increased by 42%.

　　The practice of running the cooperative's production over the past two years has fully demonstrated the superiority of the cooperative system in developing production, achieving common prosperity, paying according to labor, avoiding differentiation, and conforming to the state's economic plan.

　　II. How This Year's Bumper Harvest Was Achieved

　　In terms of agricultural production increase measures, the Mass Cooperative has focused on the following key links in the past two years:

　　First, building small-scale farmland water conservancy projects and maintaining soil and water. In the year of advanced cooperativization, farmland capital construction began in the severe winter of wind and snow. In two years, 90 water wells were drilled, 30 small reservoirs were built, and many terraces and drainage ditch projects were built in mountain orchards. Soil improvement was carried out on 300 mu of stony mountain land and low-lying areas.

　　This year, the Mass Cooperative withstood the severe test of historically rare droughts and insect pests. From April 25th to July 23rd, there was no rain for 90 days, and sowing work encountered serious difficulties. Many cooperative members were panicked, and some wanted to pray for rain. However, under the correct leadership of the Party, the cooperative strengthened ideological education for its members, pointing out that today there is sufficient strength to conquer drought, thus establishing the confidence to resolutely fight drought and strive for a bumper harvest. After successful sowing on small areas of land by watering, the quota for drought resistance and water transportation was rationally determined, and thousands of men, women, old, and young were mobilized to launch a mass drought resistance struggle. The broad masses of cooperative members, regardless of the heat, resolutely overcame all difficulties, utilizing all wells and reservoirs, digging riverbeds, and finding springs to sow 1,200 mu of land while fighting the drought, watering more than 1,000 mu of cotton and peanut fields, and irrigating 2,400 fruit trees. After a month and a half of hard work, the drought was basically overcome, and timely sowing was achieved, saving the seedlings. The masses reflected, "If it weren't for cooperativization, no matter how great the ability, it would have been over. We were watching helplessly, how could we even think about a bumper harvest!" After the victory against the drought, aphids in 500 mu of sorghum fields were completely eliminated in one week (aphids were previously regarded by farmers as incurable "divine insects"). The great victory in the fight against natural disasters is an important factor in achieving this year's bumper harvest.

　　Second, increasing base fertilizer, expanding topdressing fertilizer, and vigorously developing a year-round fertilizer accumulation campaign. The cooperative controlled fertilizer sources from three aspects: (1) developing animal husbandry and raising hogs in pens; (2) strengthening the management of human manure and urine, with toilets in every household and toilets at the edges of the fields, collecting human urine separately and accumulating niter ash separately; and (3) composting large amounts of green manure. In addition, there was also the annual rotation (four-year cycle) of removing kang (platform bed) and collecting scattered manure and fertilizer.

　　The measures for mastering fertilizer accumulation were mainly: 1. Fertilizer accumulation tasks were prescribed from the production team and production group to the household. For example, each head of livestock and each fattened pig would accumulate 150 piles of manure per year. 2. The manure from the pens, human manure and urine, and chicken and duck manure of cooperative members were all reasonably priced and purchased. 3. The livestock pens in cooperative members' homes were frequently padded, and this work was completely contracted by the cooperative. A total of 550 large jars were placed under the 600 latrines in the cooperative, and every household had urine buckets and urine pots. 4. According to living conditions, four fertilizer accumulation areas were identified, each with two "sanitation workers" responsible for cleaning latrines, picking urine from house to house, issuing urine tickets, and processing urine mud. A reward and punishment system was also established. One deputy director of the cooperative and one deputy captain of each team were responsible for fertilizer accumulation. Three fertilizer accumulation professional meetings were held each year.

　　This year, the cooperative's fertilizer expenditure reached 41,824.4 yuan (an average of 50 yuan in manure price per cooperative member household), and the labor input for fertilizer accumulation reached 15,403 workdays. Over the past year, the cooperative accumulated a total of 157,370 piles of fertilizer (39,342,500 jin), averaging 35 piles of fertilizer per mu, basically achieving self-sufficiency in manure. Last year, 77,000 jin of chemical fertilizer were purchased, but this year only 2,000 jin were purchased.

　　Third, a series of measures were taken in technical reform: promoting two-season crops on 280 mu (planting sorghum and corn after potatoes, and trial planting peas as the first crop), intercropping 450 mu of sorghum with soybeans, and mixing 400 mu of millet with small beans, all of which resulted in increased production, which dispelled the conservative idea of "not planting two grains on one plot."

　　According to soil fertility conditions, the cotton fields implemented reduced ridges and increased rows to increase the unit area yield of cotton by 8%-10%. The cooperative established 396 mu of seed retention land, basically achieving self-selection, self-breeding, and self-retention of improved varieties. This year, it also introduced the excellent sorghum variety "Er Wu San" and pure cotton variety "Guan Nong No. 1" from the Xiong Yue Agricultural Experimental Station, cultivating 50 mu of mother seed land, which is enough for promotion next year.

　　Fourth, developing diversified operations in accordance with local conditions. Adapting to the characteristics of mountainous areas, the cooperative focused on agriculture, while actively developing diversified operations to assist the development of agricultural production. Thirty scattered cattle, 515 sheep, and 57 hogs were raised collectively. Utilizing the intervals between agricultural activities for transporting goods to mines and doing odd jobs, this year's income in three months was nearly 30,000 yuan. 71,000 trees have been planted over the past two years. In addition, iron furnaces, weaving, and tinsmithing were also operated to serve agricultural production and the lives of cooperative members.

　　III. "Thrifty Housekeeping" to Develop Production

　　(1) How to Further Expand Reproduction

　　The natural and production conditions of Zhang Guantun: (1) High population density and limited land, with an average of only 1.28 mu of cultivated land per person. The mountainous area is more than twice the existing cultivated land, but it is not suitable for large-scale reclamation. (2) The phenomenon of soil erosion in mountainous areas has not been fundamentally changed. It is not very significant for the time being, but it poses a great threat to the future. (3) The climate here, which farmers call "nine droughts in ten springs," requires preparation for drought resistance and watering every year. (4) Economic crops and orchards require a large amount of fertilizer, and the supply of chemical fertilizer is still unable to meet the demand in the short term. (5) This village is a suitable cotton growing area, but grain is not sufficient for self-sufficiency year-round, and 50% of the grain relies on state supply.

　　Based on the above characteristics, several prerequisites must be affirmed: First, it is necessary to actively develop a multi-departmental economy in mountainous areas, but also to adhere to the policy of increasing cotton and grain production as the main focus. Second, this cooperative lacks the conditions for large-scale reclamation, and the only way to increase production is to vigorously increase the yield per unit area. Third, it is necessary to resist various unfavorable factors in the development of production and constantly create relatively stable conditions for increased production.

　　The Mass Cooperative plans to take the following measures to increase production in field management next year: (1) Vigorously promote autumn plowing to replace cotton and grain crop rotation, and to prevent cotton wilt and other insect pests. (2) Universally promote improved varieties (sorghum "Er Wu San" and pure cotton variety "Guan Nong No. 1"). (3) Increase manure application, averaging 40 piles per mu of field. (4) Expand intercropping and interplanting, and promote two-season crops. (5) Improve the soil and tidy up stony land. (6) Utilize all idle land, such as the open spaces between fruit trees, develop the edges of fields, ditches, dry riverbeds, and mountain slopes with an inclination of around ten degrees, which can increase cultivated land by a total of 200-250 mu. After the implementation of the above measures, the average yield of cotton per mu can reach 300 jin, and the total grain output can increase by 250,000 to 300,000 jin. Next year, the cooperative can achieve 70% self-sufficiency in grain.

　　In terms of diversified operations, the projects that should be focused on in the future are: first, raising pigs on a large scale, achieving self-sufficiency in piglets and raising two and a half pigs per household within the next two years. The second is to continue to develop fruit trees, striving to reach 33,427 trees within five years, and to reach an annual apple production of 2 million jin by 1962. Third, to restore oak silkworm production starting next year, developing a total of four pairs of shears. Fourth, planting cotton locust in mountain gullies and pasture on mountain slopes. The plan is to green all mountainous areas within five years.

　　In order to ensure the realization of production increase targets, it has been decided to carry out soil and water conservation projects and increase farmland drought resistance irrigation facilities on a yearly basis; to complete all mountain ditch and terrace projects in stages, and to modify the ridges of mountains according to contour lines.

　　At the same time, we must continue to organize year-round fertilizer accumulation well, striving to increase the total amount of fertilizer accumulated each year by 33% compared to this year.

　　(2) Universally Establish a "Thrifty Housekeeping" Atmosphere

　　The living standards of the members of the Mass Cooperative have been rising in recent years. Households that previously owed debts and had empty family fortunes have paid off their debts. It should be seen as a normal phenomenon that peasants appropriately improve their lives and add daily necessities, but it is worth noting that a tendency towards extravagance and excessive pursuit of immediate enjoyment of life has already occurred. A considerable number of cooperative members have ignored living within their means and not making long-term plans, pursuing a high standard of living. They said, "In this era, no one wants to buy houses and land, tie up carts, or buy horses. If you have money, you spend it on eating, clothing, and using. What's the use of saving money!" Some cooperative members use rationed grain to feed pigs. Some have been squandering large amounts since the distribution of income last year. For example, poor peasant Cao Xibao drinks liquor every day, often buys canned goods, buys watches instead of buying grain, and borrows from the cooperative when he runs out of money. Some wealthy households would rather store goods than save money. As soon as they hear that there is a shortage of supplies on the market, they must buy them. Rich middle peasant Cao Yonghou bought fifteen autumn undershirts at once when the cloth ration was halved in the summer. Wang Chunshan bought more than ten bed sheets at once, as well as many towels and socks. Many cooperative members are even unwilling to collect firewood and demand a large supply of coal. This competition in life has almost become a trend in the past two years.

　　In order to change this atmosphere and promote the spirit of running the cooperative thriftily and managing the household thriftily, the branch has decided to carry out work in the following aspects: (1) In conjunction with this year's income distribution and the winter rectification campaign, vigorously carry out education on running the cooperative thriftily and managing the household thriftily, so that cooperative members understand that the improvement of life can only be gradual, and that living a life should also have the plan of "making up for deficiencies with surpluses," and advocating saving and reserves. (2) Commend typical households in this village and cooperative who are thrifty in running the household, promote the experience of saving grain, and criticize the ideas and behaviors that only care about the individual and not the collective. (3) Strengthen credit cooperation and vigorously carry out deposit business, encouraging long-term deposits. (4) Because this year's harvest is good, the public accumulation fund and public welfare fund have been decided to be kept at 10% of the net income.

　　两年里的变化
　　——大众社的生产怎样赶过了富裕中农的水平
    中共辽宁省辽阳地委第一书记　曾宇
    辽宁省营口县大众农业合作社，就它的办社规模与生产情况来说，一般可以反映辽南经济作物区的某些共同特点（如人多地少、特产较多、工农业关系密切，人民生活水准较高等）。这个社是1954年由二十九户贫农下中农组成的，以后两年又经过扩大与合并，1955年冬实现了高级合作化以后，生产的发展出现了一种飞跃，去年农民的生活已经赶上了富裕中农的生活水平。
    一、98％的社员赶上或超过了富裕中农的生活水平
    （1）今年大众农业社的总收入（按1956年的不变价格计算）为四十六万四千六百五十九点零三元，较丰收的去年增加5.6％，较1955年增加38.3％，比解放前生产最好的1943年，增加278％。本年度农业收入占生产总值的49.2％，苹果收入占35.7％，副业占12.6％，畜牧占2.3％，杂项占0.2％。
    各种大田作物单位面积产量的变化也很大，本年度已超过四十条纲要（草案）对黄河以北地区所规定的标准，粮谷作物平均每亩产量为六百四十七斤（高粱八百，苞米六百一十，谷子四百五十六，大豆三百三十八），每亩棉花产二百八十斤，花生四百斤。如果把1943年的产量作为一百，今年的粮谷亩产量为一百六十二，棉花为一百八十四，花生为四百，那时的苹果仅占总收入的2％，今年占35.7％（一百六十六万斤，合乎出口规格的提高到61％）。
    随着生产的发展，社员收入也不断增加。今年概算社员分配的部分为三十四万四千六百八十六元，比去年增长17％，十六万劳动日，每个劳动日之值为二点一五元，每人平均全年收入为一百二十三点四元。加上家庭副业收入
  （包括粪价等），每人平均收入为一百五十七点四三元，每户为七百九十点三七元（以1943年收入为一百，1955年为二百三十二，1956年为二百七十，1957年为三百二十九）。从各阶层的收入情况看，今年各阶层每人平均收入，贫农一百四十四元，新下中农一百五十九元，老下中农一百五十一元，新上中农一百五十四元，老上中农一百八十元，富农一百三十八元，地主一百四十一元。
    （2）农民生活已经提高到什么样的水平？
    从去年秋前到今年秋收前这一段时期内，农民购置或消费的几种主要物品，计有：棉布六万五千四百六十五尺，胶鞋一千八百零五双，皮鞋八百七十二双，羊皮袄六十九件，自行车八十一辆，缝纫机四十台（自行车、缝纫机系两年累计），手表七十一块，大米四万三千五百斤，面粉九万四千斤，猪肉七万一千九百斤。
    目前全社四百四十六户中，已有四百三十七户（占总户数的98％）相当于或超过了富裕中农的生活水平，下余九户也够下中农的水平。有一户新中农说：“讲句良心话，早先的富农户也赶不上咱们今天的日子。”
    （3）另一项重要的历史性变化，就是合作社扩大再生产的能力有所增长。三年来公共积累共有八万元，1956年以前借的农业贷款、信用贷款三千多元，已全部偿还。1957年靠内部资金力量，完全可以自力更生解决扩大再生产的需要了。1955年共有役畜八十六头，去年买马十五头，今春又买八头，秋后还计划买十三头（这样每头牲口负担耕地二十五亩），外增胶车十五台。平均每亩施肥量较合作化前富裕中农增加75％，单位面积产量增加42％。
    两年来办社生产的实践，充分显示了合作制度的发展生产、共同富裕、按劳取酬、避免分化和服从国家经济计划的优越性。
    二、怎样取得今年的丰收
    在农业增产措施上，大众社两年来着重抓住了以下几个环节：
    第一，兴修小型农田水利和保持水土。高级合作化的当年，曾在风雪交加的严寒季节，开始了农田基本建设，两年打成水井九十眼，修小型水库三十座，山地果园修筑了许多梯田、撩壕工程；山地拣石子，洼地土壤改良三百亩。
    今年，大众社经受了历史上少有的干旱、虫害的严重考验，从4月25日到7月23日，九十天无雨，播种工作碰到严重困难。许多社员恐慌不安，有的要去求雨。但是，合作社在党的正确领导下，加强了对社员的思想教育，指出今天有足够力量征服旱灾，因而确立了坚决抗旱力争大丰收的信心。在小面积土地上浇种成功后，就合理确定抗旱运水的定额，动员上千名男女老少，展开了群众性的抗旱斗争。广大社员不顾炎热，坚决排除一切困难，利用一切水井水库，挖河底，找泉眼，抗旱播种一千二百多亩，水浇棉田花生地一千多亩，灌溉果树二千四百棵。经过一个半月的艰苦奋斗，基本上战胜了旱灾，做到适时播种，挽救了幼苗。群众反映，“若不是合作化，天大的本事也完了，眼瞅着瞎，那还敢想丰收呢！”在抗旱胜利后，又用一个星期完全消灭了五百亩高粱田里的蚜虫（蚜虫过去被农民看成是治不了的“神虫”）。对自然灾害斗争的巨大胜利，是今年获得丰收的重要因素。
    第二，增施底肥、扩大追肥、大力开展常年积肥运动。合作社从三个方面控制粪源：（1）发展畜牧业、圈养毛猪；（2）加强人粪尿的管理，每户有厕所，地头设厕所，单收人尿、单攒硝灰；（3）大量沤绿肥。此外，还有逐年轮流（四年一轮）扒炕和收拾散粪散肥。
    掌握积肥的措施主要是：一、从生产队、生产组到户都规定出积肥任务。如每头大牲口、每头肥猪每年攒粪一百五十堆。二、对于社员的圈粪、人粪尿、鸡鸭粪都合理作价收购。三、社员家庭的畜圈勤起勤垫，这个工作完全由合作社包干。全社六百个便所共下了五百五十口大缸，每户都设有尿桶尿盆。四、按居住条件，找出四个积肥区，每区有“卫生员”二人，专管清理便所，逐户挑尿，发尿票，加工做尿泥。并定有奖惩制度。社有副主任一名，各队一名副队长专管积肥。每年召开积肥专业会议三次。
    今年全社粪肥开支共达四万一千八百二十四点四元（平均每户社员得粪价五十元），积肥投入的劳动量达一万五千四百零三个劳动日，一年来全社共积肥十五万七千三百七十堆（三千九百三十四万二千五百斤），平均每亩上三十五堆肥，基本上做到了粪肥自给自足。去年曾购入化学肥料七万七千斤，今年只购入二千斤。
    第三，在技术改革上，采取了一系列的措施：推行二季作物二百八十亩（土豆下楂种高粱苞米、试种头楂豌豆），四百五十亩高粱套种大豆、四百亩谷子混种小豆，都获得增产，这就打消了“一地不种二粮”的保守思想。
    根据土地肥瘠情况，实行棉田缩垅增行提高棉花单位面积产量8％—10％。这个社建立留种地三百九十六亩，基本做到自选、自育、自留良种，今年又从熊岳农业实验站引入优良高粱品种“二五三”号和棉花关农一号纯种，培植母种地五十亩，已够明年推广所用。
    第四，因地制宜地发展多种经营。适应山区特点，以农业为主，同时积极发展了多种经营、辅助农业生产的发展。集体养散牛三十头、羊五百一十五只、养猪五十七口。利用农事间隙给矿山运输，做杂活，今年三个月就收入近三万元。两年来植树造林七万一千棵。此外，还经营了铁炉业、编织业、焊锡匠等为农业生产和社员生活服务。
    三、“勤俭持家”发展生产
    （一）怎样进一步扩大再生产
    张官屯的自然条件和生产条件：（1）人多地少，每人平均占有耕地面积仅一亩二分八，山岚面积大于现有耕地两倍以上，但不适于大量开荒；（2）山地水土流失现象尚未根本改变，暂时为害还不大显著，但对于未来却贻患甚大；（3）这里的气候规律，农民叫做“十春九旱”，每年需做抗旱浇种的准备；（4）经济作物与果园需肥量很大，短时期内化学肥料仍供不应求；（5）本村属宜棉区，粮食常年不足自给，50％的粮食靠国家供应。
    基于上述特点，必须肯定几个前提：一是既要积极开发山区多部门经济，又要坚持以增产棉粮为主的方针；一是这个社缺乏大片开荒条件，增产的唯一途径是大力提高单位面积产量；一是抵制发展生产上的各种不利因素，不断地创造相对稳定的增产条件。
    大众社计划明年在大田经营上，采取以下几项增产措施：（1）大力推广秋耕地，以秋翻代替棉粮倒茬，并能防止棉花黄萎病与其他虫害；（2）普遍推广良种（高粱二五三号新种，棉花纯种关农一号）；（3）增施粪肥，大田每亩平均增至四十堆；（4）扩大套种、间作，推广二季作物；（5）改良土壤，整理石头地；（6）利用一切闲散地，如果树间的空地，开拓地边、沟沿、干河套以及十度上下的山平坡，共可增加耕地二百——二百五十亩。实现以上几项措施以后，棉花亩平均产量可达三百斤，粮谷总产量可增产二十五万至三十万斤。明年全社可做到70％的粮食自给。
    在多种经营方面，今后应着重发展的项目，第一位是大量养猪，在今明两年内做到，仔猪全社自给，每户养猪两口半。第二是继续发展果树，争取五年内达到三万三千四百二十七棵，至1962年苹果年产量达二百万斤。第三、明年起恢复柞蚕生产，共发展四把剪子。第四、山沟种植棉槐，山坡种牧草。计划五年内山地全部绿化。
    为了保证增产目标的实现，决定分年兴修水土保持工程，增加农田抗旱灌溉设施；分期完成全部山地撩壕和梯田工程，山地按等高线改垄。
    同时，还要再接再厉组织好常年积肥，争取每年总积肥量比今年增加33％。
    （二）普遍树立“勤俭持家”的风气
    大众社的社员生活水平近年来是直线上升，过去欠下债的部分家底空的农户已还清了债，农民们适当地改善生活和添置日用备品，应视为一种正常现象，但是值得注意的是，一种铺张浪费、过分追求眼前生活享受的倾向已经发生，相当一部分社员已忽视量入为出，不作长期打算，追逐高标准的生活。他们说“这种年头谁也不想买房置地、拴车、买马，有钱就奔吃奔穿奔用，攒钱有啥用！”有的社员用口粮喂猪。有的从去年收益分配以后就大事挥霍。如贫农曹希保，天天喝烧酒，经常买罐头，吃粮不买买手表，钱花光了又向社里借。有些富裕户宁愿存物不存钱，一听到市场上什么物资缺就非买不可，富裕中农曹永厚在夏天布票减半的时候，一次就买十五身秋衣，王春山一次买了十多块床单，还有许多毛巾同袜子。许多社员连柴草也不愿打了，要求大量供应煤炭。这种生活上的竞赛，近两年来几乎相沿成风。
    为了改变这种风气，发扬勤俭办社、勤俭持家的风气，支部决定从以下几方面进行工作：（1）结合今年收益分配和冬季整风整社，大张旗鼓开展勤俭办社、勤俭持家的教育，使社员明白生活的改善只能是逐步的，过日子同样要有“以丰补歉”的打算，提倡节约储备；（2）表扬本村本社勤俭持家的典型户，推广节约粮食的经验，批评那种只顾个人，不顾集体的思想和行为；（3）加强信用合作，大力开展存款业务，鼓励长期存款；（4）因为今年丰收，公积金、公益金决定留到纯收入的10％。
