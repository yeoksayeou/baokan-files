    The First National Tropical Botanical Garden
    The first national tropical botanical garden has been built on the site of the former Red Army Farm in Lehui County, Hainan Island. The garden is now introducing and planting tropical crops from home and abroad, conducting ecological cultivation trials of major economic crops, and cultivating and propagating fine seeds.

    The planning of this garden was carried out under the personal guidance and assistance of Chinese agricultural scientists and Soviet experts. Experts believe that this is indeed an ideal place to build a tropical botanical garden. Soviet expert Dr. A.H. Fedorov also provided valuable advice on how to utilize, protect, and organize native plant species.

    Currently, the plant specimen exhibition area of ​​the garden has gathered more than 200 kinds of tropical crops from home and abroad, including more than a dozen kinds of rare tropical fruit trees newly introduced from abroad, such as durian, sago coconut, grape dan, rambutan, golden banana, and mangosteen.

    全国第一个热带植物园
    全国第一个热带植物园在海南岛乐会县红军农场旧址兴建就绪。现在该园正在引植国内外各地的热带作物，进行主要经济作物生态试验栽培，和培育繁殖优良种苗等工作。
    这个园的规划工作是在我国农业科学家和苏联专家的亲临指导和帮助下进行的。专家们认为，这里确是建设热带植物园的理想地方。苏联专家AH·A费德罗夫博士还特别对如何利用、保护和整理原生植物种类提出了宝贵的意见。
    目前，该园的植物标本展览区里，已汇集了来自国内外各地的二百多种热带作物，其中有的是新近从国外引种的榴莲、砂谷椰子、葡萄丹、红毛丹、金芭蕉、山竹子等十多种珍贵热带果树。
