Determined to Streamline Institutions
By our reporter Gu Lei

A Shocking Ratio

During the rectification campaign, the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant resolutely implemented the principle of rectifying while correcting, using a revolutionary spirit to streamline its institutions and reduce management personnel, achieving great results: the proportion of management personnel to the total number of employees dropped from 17.14% to 7.5%. This is a shocking ratio.

Their institutional streamlining work was carried out based on the principles of building the country and running enterprises through diligence and thrift, which means using fewer people, spending less money, and producing more steel, and building a lean production team on the basis of ensuring continuous development of production. With this idea, there was determination, and swift and decisive measures were taken, while being cautious and steady. For example, because the situation of each production post was not fully understood, in order not to affect production work, more department personnel were reduced (67.08%), less production workshop personnel were reduced (48.58%), more management personnel were reduced (71.18%), and less production technical personnel were reduced (32.39%).

Their methods of streamlining institutions are full of innovative spirit, roughly speaking, there are six methods: First, merge certain departments with similar businesses that can be centrally managed. For example, the Finance Section and the Accounting Section are merged, the Coking, Coal Washing, and Chemical Engineering workshops are merged, and the Power Generation Workshop and the Electrical Repair Workshop are merged. Second, change the practice of excessively detailed division of labor, abolish some institutions, and transfer their business to other departments for management. For example, the Technical Education Section is abolished and its work is respectively transferred to the Cadre Section and the Labor Organization Section, and the Supervision Office is abolished and its business is respectively transferred to the Party's Discipline Inspection Commission and the administrative personnel department. Third, organize professional collaboration and remove some redundant and unnecessary work. For example, many departments have professional personnel divided by workshop, while the workshop has a functional group for this profession, so the professional personnel in the departments are eliminated. Fourth, improve business, improve work efficiency, and develop multiple skills, allowing each person to do several tasks within the scope of similar businesses. For example, the workshop's material clerk is in charge of both materials and cost accounting, and the planning and economic staff is in charge of both planning and cost accounting. Fifth, when assigning cadres, emphasize personally doing specific work, and set up few or no deputy positions that do not do specific work. For example, the Finished Products Section Chief is responsible for sales plans, the Accounting Section Chief is in charge of the general ledger, the Welfare Section Chief is in charge of welfare measures, and the Administrative Section Chief is in charge of confidential work. Sixth, strive to transfer some public institutions in the enterprise out, but still serve the factory, such as housing, public baths, and employee spare time schools.

Their handling methods for the streamlined personnel are: (1) The factory has expansion tasks next year, and more than 500 people will support capital construction; (2) More than 100 people will return to production posts to strengthen the backbone force in production; (3) More than 40 people will be sent to the grassroots to strengthen grassroots leadership; (4) More than 300 people will go to the countryside to participate in agricultural production; (5) Another group of people, such as female comrades who lack working ability, are planned to be mobilized to participate in household labor and other social labor.

The First Signal to Change Customs and Habits

The Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant's resolute streamlining of institutions is a signal to change customs and habits on the industrial management front!

Here, it is worth reviewing the brief history of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant. Like many industrial enterprises across the country, the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant has developed rapidly in production. Compared with 1949, the output of pig iron in 1956 was 18.84 times higher, and the total labor productivity was 4.38 times higher. The enterprise has strengthened its production team, improved and expanded its management institutions, learned and established various advanced management systems, mastered many advanced technologies, trained a large number of professionals, established a normal production order, and improved labor productivity, added new professions such as planning management, economic accounting, and labor organization; promoted 1,437 cadres and transferred 830 employees to support fraternal factories and mines.

However, because the leading staff of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant did not firmly establish the idea of running enterprises diligently and thriftily, they did not pay attention to controlling the phenomenon of repeated expansion of management institutions and personnel. In terms of thought and action, many inappropriate ideas and practices occurred. For example, they believed that "the larger the institution, the better, the more cadres, the better," "increasing tasks requires increasing people," only arranged personnel based on the peak load of production, emphasized reserving mobile forces and setting up more cadres, developed specialties without paying attention to collaboration and simply adding people, and established responsibility systems emphasizing excessively detailed division of labor and setting up more institutions, etc. Of course, at the beginning, due to the lack of experience in managing enterprises, the business was from scratch, learning while doing, and it was necessary to equip more cadres. However, over the years, the level of enterprise management has been improved to a certain extent, but the phenomenon of bloated institutions and overstaffing has not been overcome. As a result, the number of management cadres in the factory in 1949 was only 343, accounting for 8.85% of the total number of employees, but by the end of August this year, it had developed into 1,975, accounting for 17.14% of the total number of employees. As a result, there were too many people, great waste, low efficiency, and slow problem-solving, which formed a constraint on the improvement of production.

Is the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant the only one with the above phenomenon? No, it should be said that it is common to industrial enterprises across the country. However, these enterprises, due to their lack of determination, or for various reasons, have never taken resolute steps, and even do not believe that the surplus people can be reduced. The Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant has taken a big step forward in this regard, which is a 180-degree turn. They have used their achievements to prove to industrial enterprises across the country that the trend of continuous expansion of establishments can be blocked, the existing excessive management personnel can be reduced by a large amount, and the proportion of management personnel can at least be controlled below 10%. This is the revolutionary spirit of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant's streamlining work, and this spirit is also needed by industrial enterprises across the country.

The Starting Point for Reaching a New Height

In our industrial enterprises, management institutions and systems serve the development of production, and the institutions and systems themselves are not the goal. Production is constantly developing, and institutions, systems, management methods, and work styles must also change accordingly to adapt to the needs of production, otherwise, they will hinder the progress of production work.

The great significance of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant's streamlining of institutions lies in this. Their streamlining of institutions was carried out under the following circumstances: production has been greatly developed, management institutions have been improved, various systems have been established, technical level has been greatly improved, bureaucratic style has been gradually overcome, and the socialist consciousness of employees has greatly increased. At this time, the implementation of streamlining institutions requires a series of new constructions in the enterprise.

Taking management institutions and various systems as an example, in the past, it basically took such a path: from scratch, learning while doing, from simple to complex. Today, to turn complexity into leanness, it is impossible without the past work foundation, and it is also impossible without new construction in this area. Because some institutions have been merged or abolished and personnel have been reduced under the situation of increasingly heavy production tasks, the leadership must organize a more scientific division of labor, establish more sensitive management systems, cultivate cadres with stronger responsibility and multiple skills, find work methods that can more timely understand and handle production problems, prepare more practical and advanced plans, and revise more complete and strict technical operating procedures, etc. For example, the technical supervision section has been abolished for supervising the technological process, and only the supervision of raw materials and finished products is retained, reducing 53 of the 58 supervisors. This requires strengthening a series of work, ensuring that there are complete technical operating procedures, improving the responsibility system for regional management, further strengthening workers' awareness of complying with procedures, and turning specialized technical supervision work into mass supervision work. For example, some departments have been abolished, and the original work has been respectively assigned to other departments. Then, how can the departments taking over these tasks manage these tasks and continue to strengthen this work? New methods must also be sought. Through these efforts, the management level of the enterprise can be led to a new height.

From the perspective of the ideology and work style of enterprise leaders and cadres, there will inevitably be a new transformation. This streamlining of institutions is a vivid ideological education on building the country diligently and thriftily for all cadres in the factory, making them more clearly establish the idea of running enterprises diligently and thriftily, which is the most important gain. In addition, in order to improve the management level and production level in the case of fewer people and more tasks, it is necessary to establish a style of going deep into production, going deep into the masses, and timely understanding and solving problems in production, rather than a bureaucratic and red tape style; it is necessary to establish a style of strong responsibility, swift and decisive action, and decisive handling of problems, rather than a perfunctory and procrastinating work style; it is necessary to establish a style of studying production and creatively learning various advanced experiences, rather than working step by step, mechanically applying, and without using the brain; it is necessary to establish a work style full of innovative spirit, rather than a conservative work style.

Because the streamlining of institutions in the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant is still in progress, the construction of the ideological style and work style of leading cadres and the organization of enterprises has just begun, and it is currently impossible to determine how great this achievement is. However, some signs can prove that a new atmosphere will inevitably appear in the above two aspects, which will greatly liberate the productive forces and push production forward. For example, simply reducing personnel can increase labor productivity by 11.6%. If other factors are added, a production upsurge will undoubtedly be set off, which is entirely foreseeable.

Help for Leading Organs

The organizational structure and staffing situation of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant before the streamlining of institutions are a microcosm of the management situation of many industrial enterprises in our country. In recent years, the reason why the management institutions of enterprises are so large, in addition to the problems existing in the enterprises themselves, there is also the influence from higher-level organs. Because industrial leading organs also have phenomena such as excessively detailed division of labor, too many professional institutions, too many reports, and excessively strict vertical management departments, they require enterprises to establish various institutions and equip various professional cadres. Since there is this factor, then the thorough work of streamlining establishments in enterprises particularly needs the support of leading organs, otherwise it is impossible to be very smooth; at the same time, the work of streamlining institutions in enterprises will provide powerful materials for leading organs, promoting leading organs to also start streamlining institutions, or based on this, studying whether there are problems in their own institutions, establishments, and systems.

For example, the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant abolished the supervision office under the dual leadership of the Ministry's Supervision Bureau and the factory, which was after some consideration. The basic task of the supervision office in the enterprise is to supervise the completion of production tasks, prevent extravagance and waste, and prevent fraudulent behavior. However, at present, there is a strong supervisory force in the enterprise: the Party's Discipline Inspection Commission, the Workers' Congress, the workshop's supervisory network, the Communist Youth League's supervisory post, and a complete set of economic activity analysis system in finance. This force can replace the work of the supervision office with six cadres. After studying this situation, the factory asked the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry to abolish the supervision office, and the result was approved. In this way, the factory streamlined institutions and reduced cadres, and the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry can also study the supervision work in other enterprises based on this situation.

From the specific practices of merging and abolishing institutions, personnel arrangements and division of labor, etc., in the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, a series of questions worthy of study by leading organs have actually been raised.

First, assigning many cadres to undertake more work and requiring them to master multiple skills is actually a negation of the practice of excessively detailed division of labor and simple business. Then, is it better for the division of labor in enterprises to be detailed, or is it better to train more cadres who are familiar with various businesses!

Second, in the production area management, in order to save cadres and facilitate management, several workshops are merged into one workshop, which is actually a negation of the practice of dividing the workshop too small. Then, is it easier to manage large production workshops, or is it easier to manage small ones, which one is more conducive to production!

Third, abolishing the supervision office and merging some specialties to eliminate the drawbacks of business duplication, too many checkpoints, complex coordination relationships, and waste of manpower, is actually a negation of the practice of too many vertical professional institutions in higher-level organs. Then, is it better for the higher-level organs to have more or fewer specialties vertically to the enterprise, and how can it be conducive to the streamlining of enterprise management institutions!

Fourth, putting the cadres who were drawn from the workshop back to strengthen the leadership of the workshop and strengthen the specific leadership of production is actually a negation of the practice of transferring a large number of cadres and the large科室institutions in the past. Then, should the cadre strength of the enterprise in the future go from bottom to top to strengthen 科室or from top to bottom to strengthen workshops!

The above questions are related to many aspects of industrial management, and now they are raised by the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant with practical actions. This is also a revolutionary action, because it breaks through the original framework of the leadership and requires the leading organs to consider, study, and solve them.

The Last Question

Recently, many enterprises from all over the country have sent people to the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant to learn from the experience of streamlining establishments. Some people have revealed such an emotion, as if the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant's streamlining of establishments was so thorough because it has an expansion task itself, and the personnel have a way out, and other enterprises do not have such conditions, and it is difficult to reduce the surplus personnel. It is true that the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant took advantage of the expansion and encountered fewer difficulties in handling the surplus personnel. Is this really the decisive factor? Absolutely not.

The Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant's expansion task was determined as early as last year. At the beginning of this year, when the factory discussed streamlining institutions, knowing that there was an expansion task, they discussed it again and again before deciding on a 30% reduction plan. By June and July, after further research, the revised plan was only 30% to 50%, the latter was only a figure to strive for, and it was not until the end of August when the factory's big blooming and contending began that the determination to thoroughly streamline institutions was made. This determination was formed under the following conditions: the Beijing Municipal Party Committee of the Communist Party of China instructed that the work of streamlining institutions should be regarded as the primary content of improving work in the rectification process, the employees demanded through big-character posters that the factory leaders quickly correct the phenomenon of overstaffing, the influence of the large number of cadres sent down by the Beijing municipal-level organs, and the actual work had been basically figured out when formulating the previous two streamlining institution plans. Even so, some ideological obstacles were encountered. Some people disagreed with reducing a lot, some people advocated doing it in batches, some people demanded to reduce others more and reduce themselves less, and some people insisted on keeping a few more people from a purely business point of view.

Therefore, whether the work of streamlining institutions is thorough or not depends first of all not on objective conditions, but on how determined it is, on whether to change the leadership style, on whether to have a lean production team, on whether to run enterprises diligently and thriftily to improve the management level of the enterprise, and on whether to greatly improve production. If so, we must be determined to thoroughly streamline the institution. If the work is relaxed due to the problem of personnel exits before figuring out whether it can be reduced and how much can be reduced, it is still impossible to figure out the bottom line of the enterprise in this regard, which is actually an excuse for not attaching importance to streamlining institutions and lacking determination. A comrade said it well: "As long as the production team can be lean, the leadership style can be changed, and the technical level of production can be improved, people can be reduced first, even if some people are supported to study, and the enterprise runs two sets of costs, it is more cost-effective than putting them in the enterprise and mixing them together. Compared with the two, the former can make the enterprise obtain more wealth." I think this opinion is not impossible to consider, because this opinion is much better than the idea of ​​the previous comrade! Figuring out the situation and making a determination is the key to whether the institution can be thoroughly streamlined, and brilliant achievements will appear behind this determination.

    下决心紧缩机构
    本报记者　顾雷
    令人震惊的比例
    石景山钢铁厂在整风期间，坚决贯彻边整边改的方针，用革命的精神紧缩机构，减少管理人员，取得了很大的成绩：管理人员占职工总数的比例，由17.14％降至7.5％，这是个令人震惊的比例。
    他们的紧缩机构工作是依据勤俭建国、勤俭办企业的原则进行的，就是要少用人、少花钱，多出钢铁，就是要在保证不断发展生产的基础上，建设一支精干的生产队伍。有了这个思想，才有了决心，才采取了雷厉风行的手段，同时也是慎重的、稳步的。例如，由于对各个生产岗位的情况还没有完全摸透，为了不致影响生产工作，所以科室人员减的多（67.08％），生产车间减的少（48.58％），管理人员减的多（71.18％），生产技术人员减的少（32.39％）。
    他们紧缩机构的方法充满革新的精神，大体说来有六种方法：第一，合并某些业务相近，可以集中加以管理的科室。如财务科与会计科合并，炼焦、洗煤、化工三个车间合并，发电车间与电修车间合并等。第二，改变分工过细的做法，撤销一些机构，将其业务划给其他部门管理。如取消技术教育科将其工作分别划给干部科和劳动组织科，取消监察室将其业务分别划归党的监委和行政的人事部门等。第三，组织专业协作，撤除一些重复的、不必要的工作。如很多科室有按车间分工的专业人员，而车间又有这个专业的职能组，于是取消了科室里的专业人员。第四，改进业务，提高工作效率，发展多种技能，在业务相近的范围内让每个人多做几项工作。如车间的材料员既管材料又管成本核算，计划经济员既管编制计划又管核算成本等。第五，配备干部时，强调亲自动手做具体工作，少设或不设不做具体工作的副职。如成品科长负责销售计划，会计科长管总账，福利科长管福利措施，行政科长管机要工作等。第六，争取把企业中的某些事业单位移交出去，但仍为本厂服务，如住宅、公共浴室、职工业余学校等。
    他们对紧缩出来的人员的处理办法是：（一）厂内明年有扩建任务，五百余人支援基本建设；（二）一百余人返回生产岗位，以加强生产中的骨干力量；（三）四十余人下放到基层，加强基层领导工作；（四）三百余人到农村参加农业生产；（五）另有一部分人，例如缺乏工作能力的女同志，拟动员她们参加家庭劳动及其他社会劳动。
    第一个移风易俗的信号
    石景山钢铁厂坚决紧缩机构是一个工业管理战线上可以移风易俗的信号！
    在这里不妨回顾一下石景山钢铁厂的简史。同全国许许多多工业企业一样，石景山钢铁厂生产发展很快。1956年和1949年相比，生铁产量为十八点八四倍，全员劳动生产率为四点三八倍。企业里壮大了生产队伍，健全和扩大了管理机构，学习和建立了各种先进的管理制度，掌握了许多先进技术，培养和训练了大量的专业人员，建立了正常的生产秩序，提高了劳动生产率，增添了新的专业如计划管理、经济核算、劳动组织等；提拔了各种干部一千四百三十七名，调出八百三十名职工支援了兄弟厂矿。
    但是，由于石景山钢铁厂的领导工作人员没有牢固地树立勤俭办企业的思想，便没有注意对管理机构、人员一再膨胀的现象加以控制。在思想上、行动上，发生了许多不妥当的想法和做法。例如，认为“机构越大越好，干部越多越好”、“增加任务就要增加人”、只根据生产高峰的负荷安排人员编制、强调储备机动力量多设干部、发展专业时不注意协作而一味加人、建立责任制强调过细的分工而多设机构等等。当然，开始时由于缺乏管理企业的经验，业务上是从无到有、边做边学，配备较多的干部是必要的。但是，几年来管理企业的水平已有一定的提高，而机构臃肿，人浮于事的现象并未得到克服。结果，全厂管理干部1949年只有三百四十三人、占职工总数8.85％，到了今年8月底竟发展成一千九百七十五人、占职工总数17.14％了。结果人多、浪费大、效率低、解决问题慢，对生产的提高反而形成一种束缚。
    难道只有石景山钢铁厂有上述现象吗？不是的，应该说是全国工业企业目前所共有的。但是，这些企业由于决心不大，或因为这样或那样的原因，始终没有采取果敢的步骤，甚至不相信可以把多余的人减下来。石景山钢铁厂在这方面勇敢地跨了一大步，这是个一百八十度的大转弯。他们用取得的成就向全国工业企业证明：不断扩大编制的风气可以被挡住，已有的过多的管理人员可以被减掉一大半，管理人员的比例至少可以被控制在10％以下。这就是石景山钢铁厂紧缩编制工作的革命精神，这种精神也是全国工业企业所需要的。
    走向新高度的起点
    在我们的工业企业里，管理机构、制度是为发展生产而服务的，机构和制度本身并不是目的。生产不断地发展，机构、制度、管理方法、工作作风也要随之改变，去适应生产的需要，否则会阻碍生产工作无法前进。
    石景山钢铁厂紧缩机构的重大意义就在于此。他们的紧缩机构是在以下几种情况下进行的：生产有了很大的发展、管理机构已经健全、各种制度已经建立、技术水平已大大提高、官僚主义作风逐渐被克服、职工的社会主义觉悟有很大增长。在这个时候实行紧缩机构，企业中就要进行一系列新的建设。
    以管理机构和各种制度为例，过去基本上走的是这样一条路：从无到有、边做边学，由简到繁。今天，要把繁变成精干，没有过去的工作基础是不行的，没有这方面新的建设也是不行的。由于在生产任务日益加重的情况下合并或撤消了一些机构，又减少了人员，领导上势必要组织更科学的分工，建立灵敏度更高的各种管理制度，培养责任心更强而且具有多种技能的干部，寻找更能够及时了解和处理生产问题的工作方法，编制更切合实际而又先进的计划，修订更完善而又严格的技术操作规程等。例如，取消了技术监督科对工艺过程的监督，只保留对原料和成品的监督，将五十八个监督人员减掉五十三个。这就需要加强一系列的工作，要保证有完善的技术操作规程，要健全区域管理的责任制度，要进一步加强工人遵守规程的观念，要使专责的技术监督工作变为群众性的监督工作。又如，有些科室取消了，将原来的工作分别划给其他部门管，那末接管这些工作的部门如何管理这些工作而且又能继续加强这一工作呢，也必须寻求新的方法。通过这些工作，就可以把企业的管理水平引向新的高度。
    从企业领导干部思想、工作作风上看，也必然会有一个新的转变。这次紧缩机构，是对全厂干部一次生动的勤俭建国的思想教育，使他们更明确地树立了勤俭办企业的思想，这是最重要的收获。另外，为了在人少任务多的情况下提高管理水平和生产水平，就要树立深入生产、深入群众及时了解和解决生产中的问题的作风，而不是官僚主义、文牍主义的作风；就要树立责任心强、雷厉风行、果敢处理问题的作风，而不是敷衍推诿、拖拖拉拉的工作作风；就要树立钻研生产，创造性地学习各种先进经验的作风，而不是按部就班、机械搬用，不动脑筋的工作作风；就要树立充满革新精神的工作作风，而不是因循守旧的工作作风。
    由于石景山钢铁厂紧缩机构的工作还正在进行，所以领导干部思想作风和工作作风以及企业组织方面的建设刚刚开始，目前还无法肯定这一成绩究竟有多大。但是，从一些迹象可以证明，上述两方面必然会出现一片新的气象，就会大大地解放生产力，把生产向前推动一步。例如，单是减少人员一项，就可以使劳动生产率提高11.6％，如果再加上其他的因素，无疑地会掀起一个生产的高潮，这完全是可以预期的。
    给领导机关的帮助
    石景山钢铁厂紧缩机构以前的组织机构、人员编制的状况，是我国目前许多工业企业管理状况的缩影。几年来，企业的管理机构所以庞大，除掉企业本身存在问题外，也有来自上级机关的影响。因为工业领导机关也存在着分工过细、专业机构过多、报表过繁、垂直管理的部门过严等现象，于是要求企业建立各种机构、配备各种专业干部。既然有这个因素，那末企业里彻底进行紧缩编制的工作，特别需要领导机关的支持，否则不可能很顺利；同时，企业的紧缩机构的工作又会给领导机关提供有力的材料，促进领导机关也着手进行紧缩机构，或者据此研究本身的机构、编制、制度有无问题。
    例如，石景山钢铁厂撤销由部监察局和厂双重领导的监察室，是经过一番思索的。监察室在企业里的基本任务，是监督生产任务完成的情况，防止发生铺张浪费和弄虚作假的行为等。但是，目前在企业里已有一支强大的监督的力量：党的纪律检查委员会、职工代表大会、车间的监督网、共青团的监督岗、财务上一套完整的经济活动分析制度。这支力量可以代替拥有六名干部的监察室的工作。厂里研究了这个情况后，即请示冶金工业部，要求撤销监察室，结果被批准了。这样，厂里紧缩了机构、减少了干部，冶金工业部也可以根据这种情况研究其他企业里的监察工作。
    从石景山钢铁厂合并和撤销机构、人员的安排和分工等具体做法看，实际上已经提出了一系列值得领导机关研究的问题。
    第一，分配许多干部担负更多的工作，要他们掌握多种技能，实际上是对分工过细、业务单纯的做法的否定。那末，企业里的分工究竟是细了好呢，还是更多地培养熟悉各种业务的干部好呢！
    第二，在生产区域管理上，为了节省干部，便于管理，把几个车间合并成一个车间，实际上是对把车间划得太小的做法的否定。那末，生产车间究竟是大了好管理，小了好管理，那一种更有利于生产呢！
    第三，取消监察室、合并了一些专业，以消除业务重复、关口太多、配合关系复杂、浪费人力之弊，实际上是对上级机关垂直专业机构太多的做法的否定。那末，上级机关垂直到企业里的专业究竟是多了好、少了好呢，怎样才能有利企业管理机构的精干呢！
    第四，把过去从车间抽上来的干部又放回去，加强车间领导力量，加强对生产的具体领导，实际上是对过去大批干部上调、科室机构庞大的做法的否定。那末，今后企业的干部力量还是从下往上走加强科室呢，还是从上往下走加强车间呢！
    上述这些问题，联系到工业管理许多方面的工作，现在由石景山钢铁厂用实际行动提出来了。这也是一种革命的行动，因为突破了领导上原来的框子，要求领导机关考虑、研究，加以解决。
      最后一个问题
    最近，全国各地有不少企业派人到石景山钢铁厂学习紧缩编制工作的经验。有人就露出这样一种情绪，似乎石景山钢铁厂紧缩编制工作做得彻底，是因为本身有扩建任务，人员有出路，别的企业没有这样的条件，多余的人员很难减下来。不错，石景山钢铁厂占了扩建的便宜，处理编余人员时会少遇到一些困难。难道这真是决定性的因素吗？绝不是的。
    石景山钢铁厂的扩建任务，早在去年就确定了。今年年初厂里讨论紧缩机构时，在知道有扩建任务的情况下，讨论再三才确定减掉30％的方案。到了6、7月间，又经过研究，修正的计划不过30％至50％，后者只是争取达到的数字，直到8月底厂内大鸣大放开始，才下了彻底紧缩机构的决心。这个决心是在这样的条件下形成的：中共北京市委指示要把紧缩机构的工作当作整风过程中改进工作的首要内容，职工通过大字报要求厂领导迅速纠正人浮于事的现象，北京市一级机关下放大批干部的影响，制定前两次紧缩机构的方案时已基本上摸清了实际工作的底。即使这样，也还遇到了一些思想障碍，有的人不同意减掉很多，有的人主张分批搞，有的人要求多减别人少减自己，有的人从单纯的业务观点出发坚持多留几个人。
    因此，紧缩机构的工作是否彻底，首先不在客观条件，而在决心如何，在于要不要改变领导作风，要不要一支精干的生产队伍，要不要勤俭办企业提高企业的管理水平，要不要大大地提高生产。如果要，就得下决心把机构进行彻底的紧缩。如果在没有摸清能不能减、可以减多少的情况以前，因为人员的出路问题而放松了这一工作，仍然摸不清企业这方面的底，这实际上是不重视紧缩机构、缺乏决心的遁词。有一位同志说得好：“只要能使生产的队伍精干，能转变领导作风，能提高生产技术水平，可以先把人减下来，即使把一些人养活起来让他们去学习，企业里搞两套成本，也比放在企业里搅在一起合算的多，两者比较，前者可以使企业获得更多的财富。”我想这个意见并非不可以考虑，因为这个意见比前面那位同志的想法高明的多了！摸清情况、下定决心，这就是能否彻底紧缩机构的关键，在这个决心后面将会出现辉煌的成绩。
