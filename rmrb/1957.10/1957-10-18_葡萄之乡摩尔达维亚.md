Moldavia, the Land of Grapes

“Wine is Moldavia’s ‘tea’”—this is no exaggeration. Some collective farms in Moldavia even give each laborer half a liter of wine per day during the busy farming season! The Moldavian Republic is like a gorgeously dressed maiden lying on rolling hills. Its slopes are covered with vineyards and orchards. Although the area of this republic ranks fourteenth among the fifteen brothers of the Soviet family, its area of orchards and vineyards ranks first in the entire Soviet Union, with 285,000 hectares. It ranks first in the Soviet Union in terms of raw materials for wine production, second in wine production, and third in canned goods production, with an output one and a half times greater than the entire Russian national output before the revolution. The yields of other fruits, tobacco, and sunflower oil are also abundant. In addition, Moldavia's meat and milk production, calculated by output per unit area, also ranks first in the Soviet Union. This Moldavia, which was described as "full of disasters" before the revolution, now has so many productions at the forefront among the Soviet fraternal republics!

In such a developed Moldavian Republic, the people's lives are naturally wealthy and happy. But before 1940, when Moldavia was still the old Bessarabia, the situation was completely different. At that time, in Kishinev, many people wandered the streets with a sign hanging on their chest. The sign read: "Willing to do any job." "Willing to take a job with only food provided." Unemployment had become a common phenomenon. Two hundred thousand peasant households had no land, and the vast majority of arable land was in the hands of more than four hundred large landlords. A large number of working people were hungry and cold and had to go abroad to make a living. From 1926 to 1937 alone, 300,000 people fled abroad. For Moldavia, with a total population of only over two million, this number is very large. As for cultural life, it was even more out of the question; at that time, three-quarters of the people were illiterate.

With the help of the fraternal Soviet nationalities, and under Soviet power, for seventeen years, Moldavia has become a prosperous and happy socialist republic. A large industry consisting of hundreds of factories has also been established. The total industrial output has increased fivefold compared with 1940. Among them, the food industry is the most developed. Farmers are organized into more than 700 collective farms, with more than 80 tractor stations. Agriculture is becoming more and more prosperous.

Illiteracy has long been a thing of the past. At present, there are 1,800 primary and secondary schools and 7 universities. The number of university students is almost twice as many as in France and five times as many as in Turkey. There are more than 600 movie theaters, more than 560 of which are located in rural areas. In the early days of liberation, the farmers of Moldavia did not know what a movie was. In order to mobilize the farmers to watch movies, they had to provide transportation. Such things have long become history.

The capital of the republic, Kishinev, is the largest city in the republic and also the industrial and cultural center of the republic.

### 葡萄之乡摩尔达维亚

　　葡萄之乡摩尔达维亚
    “葡萄酒是摩尔达维亚的‘茶’”——这样说并不是夸张。摩尔达维亚有些集体农庄在农忙时节每个劳动力每天要发半公升葡萄酒呢！摩尔达维亚共和国像是横卧在丘陵起伏的平原上的一位盛装的姑娘。它的山坡上到处是葡萄园和果园。虽然这个共和国的面积在苏联大家庭的十五个兄弟之间占第十四位，但是它的果园和葡萄园面积占全苏第一位，有二十八万五千公顷。在生产葡萄酒的原料方面占全苏第一，葡萄酒的产量在全苏是第二位，罐头生产占第三位，产量比革命前俄国全国产量还多一倍半。其他水果、烟草、葵花子油产量都很丰盛。此外，摩尔达维亚的肉类和牛奶生产，如果按单位面积产量来计算，也已名列全苏第一位。这个在革命前被描绘成“灾难重重的”摩尔达维亚，现在有多少项生产都在苏联各兄弟共和国之间名列前茅了啊！
    在生产这样发达的摩尔达维亚共和国，人民的生活自然是富裕幸福的。但是在1940年以前，当摩尔达维亚还是旧的比萨拉比亚的时代，却完全是另一种情景。那时在基什涅夫，许多人胸前挂着一块牌子在街上游荡。牌子上写着：“同意做任何工作。”“愿意担任只管饭的工作。”失业已成了普遍现象。二十万农户没有土地，绝大部分耕地都握在四百多个大地主手里。大批劳动人民饥寒交迫，不得不到外国去谋生。仅从1926年到1937年，就有三十万人流亡到国外去。对于总共只有二百多万人口的摩尔达维亚来说，这个数目是很大的。至于文化生活，就更谈不到了，那时四分之三的人是文盲。
    在苏联各族兄弟的帮助下，在苏维埃政权下，十七年来，摩尔达维亚变成了一座繁荣幸福的社会主义共和国。由几百个工厂组成的大工业也建立起来了。工业总产量比1940年增加了五倍。其中以食品工业最发达。农民们组织在七百多个集体农庄里，拖拉机站达八十多个。农业一天天更加繁荣。
    文盲现象早已成为过去。目前仅中小学校就有一千八百所，高等学校七所。大学生的数目差不多比法国多一倍，比土耳其多五倍。电影放映场有六百多个，其中五百六十多个设在农村。解放初期，摩尔达维亚的农民不知道什么叫电影，为了动员农民去看电影，还要供给交通工具呢？这种事早已成为历史了。
    共和国的首都基什涅夫是共和国最大的城市，也是共和国的工业和文化中心。　　　　　　　　　　　　（君）（附图片）
