The Great Debate Unveils the Secret of Food Shortages
By Our Correspondent Lu Sheng

    A Minor Disturbance

As autumn crops were nearing maturity, a minor disturbance of “demanding grain from cadres” occurred in the Getiaogang Township of Changli County, Hebei Province. The instigators of this disturbance were Zhao Jinming and Liu Yuzhang, old wealthy middle peasants from the First Cooperative.

At a cooperative member symposium in mid-August, Zhao Jinming made slanderous remarks against the unified grain purchase and sale policy. He said: Since the implementation of the unified grain purchase and sale policy, no family has enough grain to eat. Liu Yuzhang also said that his family didn’t have enough grain either. Some wealthy middle peasants echoed them. Gao Yuliang said: His family members were nearly starving to death, but they couldn’t sell their land. If they hadn't joined the advanced cooperative, he could sell ten or eight mu of land immediately. After the meeting, these people engaged in activities everywhere, planning to jointly demand grain from the cadres. A wealthy middle peasant named Zhang Jingchun, who had been working diligently in the fields every day before the symposium, immediately pretended to be ill and stopped working as soon as he heard some people talking about demanding grain from the cadres. He went to the home of production team leader Zhang Buju and said, "I have nothing to eat today. You can’t just watch me starve to death.” The production team leader knew that his family not only didn’t lack grain but also had a surplus, but he found it difficult to persuade him for a while. The wealthy middle peasant Qian Guanghan felt heartache whenever he saw the particularly good crops growing on his land that had been collectivized; now, hearing some people saying dissatisfied things about the cooperative, he also stopped going to the fields and went everywhere to ask the cooperative cadres for grain.

The cry of “Go demand grain from the cadres” spread like a gust of wind throughout the cooperative for a while, causing some people who were unaware of the truth or didn't fully understand the policy to be unable to distinguish between truth and falsehood. Yang Shuxing, who had just returned to the village after demobilization from the army, said, “I wouldn't believe it if one or two people said they didn’t have enough to eat, but so many people are saying they don’t have enough, the leadership should consider it more.” Xu Yulai, who had worked as a long-term hired laborer for landlords and rich peasants for most of his life, not only didn’t refute the remarks that they didn't have enough grain but even echoed them, saying that in the past, he ate three dry meals a day when he worked long hours for the rich peasants, but now it's not as good as before. Some people knew that they were falsely claiming a grain shortage but were afraid of offending them and unwilling to refute them directly.

The Secret of "Food Shortage"

Was there a real shortage of grain or a false one? After a debate, the truth has come to light. Zhao Jinming and Liu Yuzhang, who had led the clamor that they didn’t have enough grain to eat, admitted under everyone's questioning that they were attempting to use the alleged grain shortage as an excuse to incite the masses to cause trouble for the cooperative cadres.

Liu Changhai, who had once worked as a temporary laborer for Zhao Jinming, asked Zhao Jinming at the debate: “You said you don't have enough grain to eat, I want to ask you, how much grain did you get distributed last year?” While asking, he flipped through the grain distribution ledger of the production team. Zhao Jinming had to say vaguely, "Over four thousand jin, I guess." Liu Changhai then asked him, “Was it four thousand six hundred and ninety-six jin and more?” Zhao Jinming lowered his head and said, “Yes!”

“How much surplus grain did you sell last year?”

“Seven hundred and fifty-three jin.”

“The grain left in your household totaled three thousand nine hundred and forty-three jin and more, is that right?”

“Right!”

“How many people are there in your family?”

“Eight people.”

“The average per person is four hundred and ninety-three jin, is that right?”

“Right!”

“Then why do you keep promoting that ‘three hundred and sixty jin isn't enough to eat’? Which is it, three hundred and sixty or four hundred and ninety?”

“The government stipulates three hundred and sixty jin.”

“But the government also stipulates that surplus production will be rewarded at a rate of 60%. Last year, the average grain retained per person in our cooperative was actually four hundred to five hundred jin, why don’t you mention that?”

Zhao Jinming lowered his head and had nothing to say. At this time, people participating in the debate also raised many questions, asking Liu Yuzhang, Jia Pengchun, Gao Yuliang, and others to answer. Liu Yuzhang received a total of six thousand four hundred and seventy-two jin of grain last year. After selling seven hundred jin of surplus grain, the grain left in his household totaled five thousand seven hundred and seventy-two jin, an average of four hundred and eighty-one jin per person for his twelve family members. People asked him why he claimed that he didn’t have enough to eat even with so much grain left over. Gao Yuliang said that his family members were nearly starving to death, but those who investigated the details revealed that he not only hadn't finished the grain distributed last year but also hadn’t touched a single grain of the wheat distributed this summer!

Under everyone's questioning, Liu Yuzhang had to reveal his and Zhao Jinming's plan to cause trouble.

These wealthy middle peasant households had joined the cooperative reluctantly during the high tide. This spring, they had tried to withdraw from the cooperative but failed to achieve their goal. However, they still dreamed that the advanced cooperative would reduce production and break up so they could withdraw. But the development of the situation was completely contrary to their dreams. This year, various crops were growing better than the bumper harvest of last year. The cornfield in the southeast of the village included six mu of land originally owned by Liu Yuzhang. Before joining the cooperative, although he worked hard from dawn till dusk, he had never grown such good corn as this year. After the transformation to an advanced cooperative, the members put in more effort on this piece of land, the amount of fertilizer applied was doubled compared to the past, and two "double-pipe wells" were dug at the edge of the field, which made the corn grow particularly well. But Liu Yuzhang was unwilling to see the superiority of the cooperative based on this fact. Every day he walked to the edge of this field and cursed the land for a while. He cursed the land for not being "loyal" enough to him, and he hated that the land grew better crops year after year after joining the cooperative. After cursing, he muttered to himself, "Look how good my land is, growing such good corn, and there are two more double-pipe wells. How great it would be if I could still farm it myself!” One day, he was staring at the ripening crops in a daze when Zhao Jinming suddenly came over to him and said, “Second Uncle, look how well your corn is growing! If we hadn’t joined the cooperative, how much would it be worth!” From that time on, they conspired with each other, planning to pretend that they didn't have enough grain to eat before the autumn harvest, cause trouble with the cooperative cadres, and achieve their goal of withdrawing from the cooperative to work individually after the autumn harvest.

However, after this debate, their secret of "food shortage" was thoroughly exposed, and their plan to collapse the cooperative was also bankrupt.

Distinguishing Right from Wrong and Truth from Falsehood

After the debate throughout the township, not only was the truth about the grain shortage clarified, but more importantly, the socialist awareness of the majority of cooperative members was raised. Cooperative member Xu Yulai originally thought that his life was not as good as when he was a long-term hired laborer for the rich peasants. After participating in the debate, he compared his past and present life and burst into tears. He told everyone that he had forgotten his roots. He said, "It is also a fact that I ate three dry meals a day when I was a long-term hired laborer for the rich peasants, but that was because the rich peasants wanted to exploit my labor to produce more for them." He recalled the tragic life when he ate three dry meals a day at the rich peasant's house while his mother was begging for food at home, and he resolved to fight against capitalist ideology.

After the debate, the vast majority of cooperative members further realized the superiority of the advanced cooperative. At the same time, they also realized that it is necessary to draw a clear line with capitalist ideology in order to distinguish right from wrong and truth from falsehood. For example, cooperative member Chang Yintang said at the debate: "My family has three people. After selling surplus grain last year, the average grain retained per person was four hundred and fifty jin. Because we use grain in a planned way, we not only have enough to eat but also have a surplus. However, Zhao Jinming and Liu Yuzhang retained forty jin more grain per person than my family, but they still said they didn't have enough to eat." Xiong Ruiwen said: "My family is short of a month's worth of grain this year, but this is not, as Zhao Jinming and Liu Yuzhang said, the result of implementing unified purchase and sale; the main reason my family is short of a month's worth of grain is because we didn't eat grain in a planned way. Three of my family's five people are children. Last year, we retained four hundred and fifty jin per person, the same as Yintang, which should have been even more generous than Yintang in reality, but because we fed one more pig and didn't use substitutes, the pig ended up eating three hundred jin of grain.” After listening to everyone's reasoning and calculations these days, the wealthy middle peasant Zhang Jingchun began to realize that it was wrong to follow others in asking the production team for grain. He confessed: "My family is not short of grain, but I asked the cadres for grain. This is because my individualism is too strong. Although I have joined the cooperative for several years, I have always been wavering. Why am I wavering? Because I am reluctant to part with my few mu of good land. I also proposed withdrawing from the cooperative twice in the elementary cooperative for this reason. Today, it seems that this is completely wrong. I am determined to draw a clear line with capitalist ideology and honestly participate in production."

    大辩论揭穿了缺粮的秘密
    本报记者　鲁生
    一场小小的风波
    秋庄稼快要成熟的时候，在河北省昌黎县葛条港乡发生了一场“向干部要粮吃”的小小的风波。挑起这场风波的是这个乡的第一社社员，老富裕中农赵锦明和刘玉章。
    赵锦明在8月中旬的一次社员座谈会上发表了污蔑粮食统购统销的言论。他说：实行粮食统购统销政策后，弄得哪家的粮食也不够吃的。刘玉章也说他家的粮食也不够吃了。有些富裕中农也附和着他们，高玉梁说：他家里的人已经快饿死了，但也不能卖地。要不入了高级社，他可以马上卖十亩八亩地。这些人会后到处活动，打算合伙向干部要粮食。一个叫张景春的富裕中农，座谈会前还天天上地劳动，一听到有些人说向干部要粮了，马上就装起病来不劳动了。他到生产队长张步君的家里说：“我今天就没有吃的了，你们不能看着我饿死。”生产队长明知道他家不但不缺粮，而且有余粮，但一时很难说服他。富裕中农钱光汉，每当看到他入社的土地里长的庄稼特别好，就很心痛；现在听到有些人说了些对合作社不满的话，他也不下地生产了，到处找社干部要粮食。
    “找干部要粮去”的呼声，一时像一阵风一样在全社吹起来了，使得有些不明真相或对政策认识不够的人，一时分不清真假。刚从部队复员回村的杨树兴说：“一两个人喊不够吃我不信，这么多的人喊不够，领导上应该多考虑考虑。”曾经给地主和富农做过多半辈子长工的许玉来，听了那些喊粮食不够吃的言论不但不反驳，反而附和地说，过去他给富农扛长活一天还吃三顿干，现在不如从前了。有些人明知他们说粮食不够吃是假的，但是怕得罪人，不愿当面反驳。
    “缺粮”的秘密
    到底是真缺粮还是假缺粮？经过一次辩论以后，真相已经大白。原来带头喊粮食不够吃的赵锦明、刘玉章在大家的责问下，承认了他们是企图以粮食不够吃为借口，煽动群众向社干部闹事。
    曾经给赵锦明做过短工的刘昌海在辩论会上问赵锦明：“你说你粮食不够吃，我要问问你，去年你分了多少粮食？”他一边问，一边翻着生产队的粮食分配账。赵锦明不得不笼统地说：“四千多斤吧。”刘昌海又问他：“是不是四千六百九十六斤多？”赵锦明低着头说：“是！”
    “去年你卖了多少余粮？”
    “七百五十三斤。”
    “家里留粮共有三千九百四十三斤多，对不对？”
    “对！”
    “你全家几口人？”
    “八口人。”
    “每人平均四百九十三斤，对不对？”
    “对！”
    “那你为什么老宣传‘三百六十斤不够吃’呢？到底是三百六还是四百九？”
    “政府规定的是三百六十斤。”
    “可是政府还规定超产部分要按60％的比例给奖。去年我们社每人平均留粮实际上已经是四百斤到五百斤，你为什么不提这一点呢？”
    赵锦明低着头没话说了。这时参加辩论会的人们也纷纷提出许多问题来，要刘玉章、贾朋春、高玉梁等回答。刘玉章去年共分六千四百七十二斤多粮，卖过七百斤余粮后，家里留粮共有五千七百七十二斤，全家十二口人平均每人留粮四百八十一斤。人们问他留这么多粮还说不够吃，究竟为什么？高玉梁说他家里的人已经快饿死了，摸底细的人就揭露说，他不但去年分的粮食还没有吃完，今年夏天分的麦子还没有动一颗呢！
    在大家的质问下，刘玉章才不得不把他和赵锦明企图闹事的想法说了出来。
    这几户富裕中农都是在高潮中勉强入社的。今年春天，他们曾经闹退社，没有达到目的。但是仍然梦想着高级社减产散伙好退社。可是事情的发展和他们的梦想完全相反。今年各种农作物长得比丰收的去年还好。村东南的那一片玉米地有刘玉章原有的六亩地。在入社前，虽然他起早搭黑地劳动，但是从来没有长出像今年这样好的玉米。转高级社后，由于社员们在这块土地上下了工夫，施肥量比过去增加一倍，又在地边打了两眼“双管子井”，这样才使玉米长的特别好。但是刘玉章却不愿意根据这个事实来看合作社的优越性。他每天走到这块地边就指着土地骂一阵，他骂这块地对他不够“忠实”，他恨这块地入社一年比一年长出更好的庄稼。骂过后又自言自语地说：“看我的这块地多好，长这样好的玉米，又多了两眼双管子井，要是还能让我自己来种多么好！”有一天，他正在看着快要成熟的庄稼出神，赵锦明忽然过来给他说：“二爷，你看你这块地的玉米长的多好？要不是入社了，该值多少钱呵！”从那时候起，他们便互相串连着，计划在秋收前，假装粮食不够吃，同社干部闹事，实现他们秋收后退社单干的目的。
    但是，经过这一场辩论后，他们的“缺粮”的秘密被彻底揭开了，闹垮合作社的计划也破产了。
    分清是非和真假
    全乡经过辩论以后，不仅弄清了缺粮吃的真象，更重要的是提高了广大社员们的社会主义觉悟。社员许玉来原来认为，他的生活还没有过去给富农当长工的时候好，参加了辩论会后，他对比了他过去和现在的生活，哭起来了。他对大家说，他是忘本了。他说：“过去给富农当长工吃三顿干也是事实，那是富农想剥削我的血汗为他多生产。”他想起当时他在富农家吃三顿干，母亲却在家里要饭吃的悲惨生活，下决心要和资本主义思想作斗争。
    全乡绝大多数的社员经过辩论后，更进一步认识了高级社的优越性。同时，还认识到，必须和资本主义思想划清界限，才能分清是非和真假。如社员常印堂在辩论会上说：“我家三口人，去年卖余粮后，平均每人留粮四百五十斤，因为我们有计划地用粮，现在不但够吃够用，而且还有剩余。可是，赵锦明、刘玉章留粮比我家每人高四十斤，还说不够吃。”熊瑞文说：“我家今年缺一个月粮食吃，这可不是像赵锦明、刘玉章说的是因为实行了统购统销的结果；我家缺一个月的粮，主要是因为没有有计划吃粮。我家五口人中三个是小孩，去年留粮和印堂一样都是每人四百五十斤，按实说该比印堂还宽裕，可是因为我们多喂了一口猪，也没采用代食品，结果被猪吃去了三百斤粮食。”富裕中农张景春这几天听了大家的讲道理和算账后，开始认识到跟着别人向生产队要粮是不对的。他检讨说：“我家并不缺粮食吃，却向干部要粮，这是因为我的个人主义思想太重了。我虽然入社好几年了，但是老是摇摇摆摆。为什么动摇？因为我舍不得我那几亩好土地。在初级社时两次提出退社也是为的这个。今天看来，这完全是错误的。我决心要和资本主义思想划清界限，老老实实参加生产。”
