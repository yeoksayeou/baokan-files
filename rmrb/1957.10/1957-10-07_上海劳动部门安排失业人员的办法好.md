    Shanghai Labor Department's Arrangements for Unemployed People Are Good
    (Our report) Since the first quarter of this year, the Shanghai Municipal Labor Department has helped more than 12,500 people find work.
    Most of these people were assigned to do various recycling and other conservation work. More than 300 unemployed people placed in the Shanghai Iron and Steel Plant No. 3 sorted out more than 1,600 tons of iron oxide, more than 1,500 tons of iron filings, more than 3,000 tons of refractory bricks, and more than 600 tons of steel shavings and scrap steel from garbage in the first half of this year. Unemployed people in the Yimiao District used scrap cloth from various cotton and woolen mills to piece together various beautiful children's clothing and gloves. These methods not only solve the livelihood problems of unemployed people, but also save raw materials for the country. (Bei Xianen)

    上海劳动部门安排失业人员的办法好
    本报讯　上海市劳动部门，从今年第一季以来，先后帮助一万二千五百多人找到了工作。
    这些人大部分被分配去做各种回收废料等节约工作。安置在上海钢铁三厂的三百多失业人员，今年上半年在垃圾中拣出了氧化铁一千六百多吨，铁屑一千五百多吨，耐火砖三千多吨，刨花钢、碎钢等六百多吨。邑庙区失业人员则利用各棉毛织厂的碎布料，拼制成各种漂亮的童装及手套。这些办法既解决失业人员的生活问题，又能为国家节约原料。　（贝显恩）
