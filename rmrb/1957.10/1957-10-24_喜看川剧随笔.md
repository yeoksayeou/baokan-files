We watch all kinds of plays. When we watch something enjoyable, we can't quite explain why, but our hearts are right there on our lips. Having lived to this day, watching a good play is like going to a temple fair, or watching the tide – each wave chasing the one before it. I only regret that I can't be in many places at once, can't watch them all, can't praise them all. Even when I praise, I can't always do it justice, but my feelings are like a rainbow, splashed across my heart.

If the script is good and the performance is good, the audience will love it. And the word "good" must be built on a current of resonance between the stage and the audience. Some say this play has humanity, that play has a breath of life, and the reason is that the things in the play meet our demands. Romance plays can easily be full of falseness. But some romance plays we still love to watch, because the playwrights in the old society showed their wit and courage. They dared to break the bad habits of the study and the idea of fame, stepped out of convention, faced reality, and put more life and politics into their work. The framework may be cliché, but the playwrights, close to the people, casually grabbed things that were real and available in everyday life, shining brightly, illuminating the framework, and dazzling the color. Similarly, actors who pay attention to life, study details, act with reason and emotion, and create characters with typical significance. They (including the playwrights) are not afraid of being rambling, being accustomed to the essence of song and dance drama restricting naturalistic development. They must put more effort into refinement. Highly refining life has become the secret of song and dance drama or poetic drama art.

The Chongqing Sichuan Opera Troupe, from afar, has once again brought us excellent programs in this regard. The story framework of "The Adventures of Old Man Qiao" is like the "Luoyang Bridge," where a bully brother robs a bride, fulfilling the marriage of a kind sister. But the character of Old Man Qiao, unassuming in appearance, differs from the romantic formula of talented scholars and beautiful women who judge by appearance and fall in love at first sight. The playwright is constantly teasing this comedic character. He has no servant, and awkwardness is the companion of his character and environment. However, the playwright gave him a loyal character, a simple heart, and a willingness to do what is right. Simplicity is not simple. He is a poor scholar going to Beijing to take the exam. He uses the word "shabby" to describe himself. He has real learning in his belly, and a sense of humor. Think about it, he is a character who unifies these not easily approached characteristics into one character, an ordinary character. Who can say that the playwright's creation of character is not a master of innovation?

Like Shakespeare's comedies, character enhances the romance. Similarly, in "Beating the Red Stage," the playwright created a worldly so-called "hero" who is outwardly different from his inner self from the figures in the gangs of the Jianghu world. A husband who kills, a man who takes another man's wife, if it weren't for a guilty conscience, the mask might have deceived him to the end. A vivid psychological drama, Shakespeare's Macbeth is just a higher-ranking character of the same type.

Playwrights not only grab characters from life, but also more often go to the lower classes of society to find the pillars that transform the plot (romantic arrangement). Since liberation, we have been fortunate to see so many vibrant big and small comedies. Life has taught these unknown playwrights, like Molière, to learn dialectics, with sharp eyes, always discovering the destructive forces that make up the ruling class in the lower classes. Truth follows the lives of the "lower people" into the play. Romance has a real beauty. "Radish Garden" is an example. "The Biography of Fu Nu" is another example. Its framework is still aerial, but its Jia the Blind is so real.

The script is already extraordinary, and the performance is equally wonderful. Li Wenjie's Su Ran and Gao Fenglian's Fu Nu, in the brothel, one positive and one negative, are perfectly intertwined. Li Wenyun's Qiao Xi, grasps the complexity and completeness of the character, and is good at using small actions to portray his mood. There is also Ping Ping, Qing Snake in "Borrowing an Umbrella" is a lively appearance, and Xiu Ying in "The Adventure" is a dignified appearance.

But the most wonderful performances, like any other genre, are often in excerpt plays. This is the result of the playwright's inspiration, the result of the accumulation of people's wisdom, and the result of the old actors' countless tempering. The Chongqing Sichuan Opera Troupe has also shown its skill in this regard. Zhou Mulian's "Living Capture," Qiong Lianfang's "Releasing Pei," Zhang Shufang's "Quarrel," Li Wenjie's "Drunken Slave," Li Yilin's "Stealing the Silver Bottle"... Just to give a few examples, it is worth our while to take a direct train (how could that have been possible before?), happily, to Sichuan. Now they appear before us, just the effort of queuing up to buy tickets. A tribute to the tour performance. A tribute to the local drama cause of socialist society.

    喜看川剧随笔
    李健吾
    什么戏我们也看。看畅快了，说不出所以然，却也心在口边。活到今天，看好戏就像赶庙会，又像看潮水，后浪赶前浪，但恨分身乏术，不能都看，不能都赞。赞也赞不到好处，只是感情如虹，在心头撒成一片。
    剧本好，演出好，观众就会喜欢。而“好”字又一定建立在台上台下的共鸣之流上。有人说这戏有人情味，那戏有生活气息，原因就在戏里的东西适应了我们的要求。传奇戏很容易充满假味道。可是有些传奇戏，我们照样爱看，因为剧作者在旧社会表现了他们的机智和勇敢。他们敢于破除书斋陋习与功名思想，走出遗范，面对现实，多把生活与政治放了进来。支架不免俗套，可是剧作者接近人民，顺手牵羊，就牵了日常身边实有的东西，光采奕奕，照亮支架，绚烂成色。同样是演员，留意生活，琢磨细节，动作入情入理，形象具有典型意味。他们（剧作者在内）不怕芜漫，久于歌舞剧，习于歌舞限制自然主义发展的本质。他们非在提炼上多下工夫不可。高度提炼生活，成了歌舞剧或者诗剧艺术的秘诀。
    重庆市川剧院，千里迢迢，又在这方面，给我们带来了优秀节目。“乔老爷奇遇”的故事支架仿佛“洛阳桥”，恶霸哥哥抢亲，成全了善良妹妹的婚姻。可是乔老爷这个人物，其貌不扬，先和以貌取人与一见钟情的才子佳人传奇公式不同。剧作者时刻捉弄这个喜剧人物。他没有侍童，尴尬是他的性格和环境的伴侣。然而剧作者给了他一个忠厚性格，心地质朴，而又见义勇为。质朴并不简单。他是赴京应考的穷秀才。他用寒酸二字形容自己。肚子里头有实学，也有幽默感。想一想他是这些不容易靠拢的特征统一在一个性格里的人物、一个寻常人物，谁能说剧作者创造性格，不是一个推陈出新的能手？
    像莎士比亚的喜剧一样，性格给传奇增光。同样是“打红台”，剧作者从江湖生涯的在帮人物中，创造了一个表里不符的世俗所谓的“英雄”。杀人之夫，夺人之妻，若非良心作祟，假面可能一直蒙混到头。活生生一出心理剧，莎士比亚的马克白只是一个身分更高的同型人物。
    剧作者不仅到生活里抓性格，更多的时候，还到下层社会里寻找转变情节（传奇安排）的支柱。解放以来，我们有眼福看到那么多的生气蓬勃的大、小喜剧，生活让这些无名剧作家，像莫里哀一样，学会了辩证法，目光锐利，永远到下层发现作成统治阶级的破坏力量。真理跟着“下等人”的生活进了戏。传奇有了真实的美丽“萝卜园”是一个例子。“芙奴传”又是一个例子，它的支架还要凌空，它的贾瞎子却那样实在。
    剧本已经不凡了，演出同样精彩。李文杰的苏冉和高凤莲的芙奴，在妓院一反一正，丝丝入扣。李文韵的乔溪，掌握性格上的复杂与完整，又善于用小动作刻划心情。还有苹萍，“借伞”里的青蛇是一副活泼模样，“奇遇”里的秀英又是一副端庄模样。
    但是最精彩的演出，正如任何一个剧种，往往更在折子戏里。这是剧作家灵感突发的结果、人民智慧积累的结果、老演员千锤百炼的结果。重庆市川剧团同样在这方面显出了工力。周慕莲的“活捉”、琼莲芳的“放裴”、张树方的“吵闹”、李文杰的“醉隶”、李仪林的“盗银瓶”……随手举几个例，就值得我们坐上直达火车（从前哪能行？），欢欢喜喜，去四川一趟。而今他们就在我们面前出现，只是排队买票一劳而已。为巡回演出颂。为社会主义社会的地方戏剧事业颂。
