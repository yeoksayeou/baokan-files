    Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Plant Begins Producing New Machine Tools
    (Our newspaper dispatch) The Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Plant, still under construction, has already begun producing machine tools. Among the more than twenty machine tools currently being manufactured, three are expected to be completed by the end of this year.
    These heavy machine tools comprise nine varieties. Besides vertical lathes, gantry planers, and boring machines that have been trial-produced in Shanghai, Shenyang, and other places, the remaining ones, such as forging hammers and gantry milling machines, have never been manufactured in our country before. They generally weigh thirty to forty tons each, with the largest reaching seventy tons. Once these machine tools are completed, their applications will be extremely broad, and can be used in smelting, mining, and the production of generators, boilers, and national defense industrial products.

    武汉重型机床厂开始出产新机床
    本报讯　还在建设中的武汉重型机床厂，已经开始生产机床。目前正在制造的二十多台机床中，有三台预计可在今年年底制成。
    这些重型机床有九个品种，其中除了立车、龙门刨及搪床曾在上海、沈阳等地试制过外，其余如锻锤、龙门铣等都是我国没有制造过的。它们的重量，一般都有三、四十吨重，最大的达到七十吨。这些机床制成以后，用途也极为广泛，可用来冶炼、开矿、制作发电机、锅炉和国防工业用品等。
