    A Festival for All Progressive Humanity
    Ba Jin, Vice Chairman of the Chinese Writers Association

    When I pick up my pen, I cannot stop my hand from trembling, and my heart is as warm as in spring. My heart is filled with gratitude and joy, and I send my greetings to Soviet friends: please accept my warm and heartfelt congratulations on this infinitely beautiful and joyful festival. Today, the hearts of the world's good people yearn for Moscow. The red star shining all night on the Kremlin clock tower attracts the attention of all progressive humanity. The first artificial satellite launched by the Soviet Union is orbiting the earth, announcing to the world the great beginning of mankind's conquest of the universe. 600 million Chinese people are cheering and singing in unison for the brilliant achievements of their Soviet "Big Brother". The great October Revolution that took place on Russian black soil forty years ago, like the rising sun, illuminated the world which was then covered in dark clouds and filled with the sounds of killing, and opened up a path to light for mankind. The Soviet people have worked steadily and painstakingly to build a socialist paradise on earth, and are moving step by step towards the future of communism. In the past forty years, the Soviet people have created so many miracles that are almost unbelievable, and have accomplished glorious undertakings that have shocked the whole world. Even when war was ravaging part of the world, and hunger, cold and disease were causing suffering to some of humanity, the Soviet Union has always been a great force for defending peace, and the Soviet people have tirelessly worked for a better future for mankind. The Soviet Union is a symbol of peace and happiness, a banner of civilization and progress. Not only in the mountain villages of Korea, on the construction sites of China, in the fields of Vietnam, in the yurts of Mongolia, but even in the black ghettos of the United States, the large factories of West Germany, the rubber plantations of Southeast Asia, and the slums of Tokyo, people are filled with hope and increased courage and confidence to fight when they think of the Soviet Union. Especially for those who are still exploited, oppressed, and living a life of slavery, those who are underfed, underclothed, and suffering in unemployment, the image of the Soviet people always inspires them, and the Soviet people set a worthy example before their eyes. In the Soviet people they see the brilliance of lofty ideals, and in the achievements of socialist construction they find the goals of their own struggle. In the past forty years, the Soviet people have led the people of all colors around the world on the road to progress through one victory after another. Hundreds of thousands of people have been inspired by the Soviet Union, overthrown colonial rule, and begun to stand up and be their own masters. Today, in various languages, the two proper nouns "Soviet Union" and "October Revolution" contain endless dear emotions and countless moving stories.
    Whether they have visited the Soviet Union or never been to the Soviet Union, they can all see the amazing achievements and infinitely beautiful prospects of this great country, and they will feel how closely these achievements and prospects are related to them personally. Even those long numbers, like musical notes, evoke their resonance with exciting music. People who enter the Soviet Union for the first time will not feel strange either. They feel as if they have returned to their hometown, not only because the Soviet people treat their friends like their own brothers, but also because in the Soviet Union they find a peaceful, happy, vibrant, colorful and ever-changing living environment. Their dreams have become a reality in this country, and their personal feelings are melted into such universal, natural, and deep "comradeship". Every guest who comes to the Soviet Union has a special feeling of happiness, like a drop of water placed in the ocean.
    I myself have such a feeling. In the past seven years, I have set foot on the black soil of the Soviet Union three times, and each time I felt like I was coming home. Everywhere I went I heard hearty laughter and saw kind smiles. Even the eyes that watched silently contained deep friendship. A firm handshake brings two hearts closer together, and even people who meet for the first time can't wait to give you their best to take back with you. Living among Soviet friends is like living in my own home. We understand each other very well, and there is no restraint at all, as if we have always lived together and there is no language barrier. What moved me especially was that in socialist Soviet Union I see everywhere: serious work, responsible attitude and dedication. The power of the whole country is focused on the cause of peaceful construction, and the entire people are marching forward in unison, with one heart and one mind, towards communism. ... What an exciting scene! Everything I read in Soviet literary works is alive before my eyes, (Soviet literary works have become an indispensable part of the spiritual food of Chinese readers. They have educated the Chinese people with socialist ideology, and Soviet writers occupy such a high and close position in the hearts of Chinese youth!) and is more vivid, more concrete, and more gripping than anything described in any novel. I really want to give everything I have to participate in this huge line, to be a small stone or even a grain of sand in this great construction work. Only then did I deeply understand the meaning of friendship arising from common ideals, common goals and common cause. I love the Soviet Union and the Soviet people even more, just like I love my own motherland and people. I also understand more deeply how much the unbreakable friendship between the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union means to the destiny of all mankind. I also understand more deeply how much influence the brilliant achievements of the Soviet people in the past forty years have had on the Chinese people.
    This is not only my personal feeling, nor is it only the feeling of a Chinese writer. How many Chinese people have been to the Soviet Union! I can say that they all have such feelings, perhaps with deeper and stronger emotional expressions, and more and stronger expressions of friendship. But this is only a difference in degree, the feelings are still the same. We don't need to find many words to explain the flesh-and-blood relationship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples. This is an ironclad fact. The Soviet "Big Brother" holds the hand of the Chinese brothers and advances together on the brilliant road of revolution and construction. After joyfully celebrating their eighth National Day, 600 million Chinese people are today welcoming the 40th anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution with the same joy. This day of great joy is not only a festival for the Soviet people, it is also a festival for the working people of the world, and it is also a festival for all progressive humanity.

    全体进步人类的节日
    中国作家协会副主席　巴金
    我拿起笔就没法制止我的手的颤动，我的心暖和得像在春天一样。 我的心里充满了感激和喜悦之情，我向苏联的朋友们问好：在这个无限美好、无限欢乐的节日里，请接受我的热烈的、衷心的祝贺。今天世界善良人民的心一致地向往着莫斯科。克里姆林宫钟楼上彻夜发光的红星吸引了全体进步人类的目光。苏联发射的第一颗人造卫星正在环绕地球运行，向全世界宣告人类征服宇宙的伟大开端。六万万中国人民为着他们的苏联“老大哥”的辉煌成就齐声欢呼歌唱。四十年前在俄罗斯黑土上发生的伟大的十月革命像初升的太阳似地照亮了当时乌云蔽天、杀声四起的世界，给人类开辟了一条走向光明的道路。苏联人民脚踏实地，历尽千辛万苦，在人间建设社会主义的乐园，而且一步一步地向着共产主义的前途迈进。四十年来苏联人民创造了多少几乎令人不能相信的奇迹，完成了使整个世界震惊的光荣事业。甚至在战争蹂躏着世界的一部分的时候，在饥饿、寒冷和瘟疫使一部分人类受苦的时候，苏联始终是保卫和平的巨大力量，苏联人民一直不倦地为着人类美好的未来工作。苏联是和平与幸福的象征，是文明和进步的旗帜。不说在朝鲜的山村，在中国的工地，在越南的田上，在蒙古的包内，甚至在美国的黑人区，西德的大工厂，南洋的橡胶园，东京的贫民窟，人们一想到苏联，就充满了希望，增加了斗争的勇气和信心。尤其是对于今天还被剥削、受压迫、过着奴隶生活的人，吃不饱、穿不暖、在失业中憔悴受苦的人，苏联人的形象永远鼓舞着他们，苏联人放了一个值得学习的榜样在他们的眼前。在苏联人身上他们看到了崇高的理想的光辉，在社会主义建设的成就上他们找到了自己奋斗的目标。四十年来苏联人民一次又一次的胜利领导全世界各种肤色的人民走上进步的道路，多少万人受到了苏联的鼓舞，推翻了殖民主义的统治，开始站起来作自己的主人。今天在各种不同的语言里，“苏联”和“十月革命”这两个专门名词包含了说不尽的亲爱的感情，和讲不完的动人的故事。
    不论是访问过苏联或者从未到过苏联的人，他们一样地看得见这个伟大国家的惊人的成就和无限美好的远景，而且会感觉到这些成就和远景跟他们个人有多么密切的关系。连那些很长的数字也像音乐的符号用激动人心的乐曲引起他们的共鸣。第一次走进苏联国境的人也不会感觉到陌生，他们好像回到了故乡一样，不仅因为苏联人对待朋友像对待自己的兄弟，而且因为在苏联他们找到一个和平幸福、充满朝气、丰富多采、变化万千的生活环境。他们的梦想在这个国家里变成了现实，他们的个人的感情融化在那么普遍、那么自然、那么深厚的“同志爱”里面。每一个来到苏联的客人都有一种特殊的幸福的感觉，就像一滴水放进海洋里一样。
    我自己就有这样的一种感觉。七年来我三次踏上苏联的黑土，每一次我都像是回家一样。在任何地方我都听见爽朗的笑声，看见亲切的笑容。连默默注视的眼光里也含着深的友情。一次紧紧的握手就把两颗心拉近贴在一起，甚至第一次见面的人都恨不得把他的最好的东西交给你带回去。我生活在苏联朋友的中间就好像住在自己的家里，彼此非常了解，没有一点拘束，仿佛从来就在一起生活，并无语言的隔阂。尤其使我感动的是，在社会主义的苏联我无处不看到：严肃的工作，负责的态度和献身的精神。全国的力量都放在和平的建设事业上面，全体人民踏着整齐的步伐，万众一心地向共产主义大步前进。……这个景象叫人多么兴奋！我在苏联文学作品中所读到的一切全活在我的眼前，（苏联文学作品已经成为中国读者所不可缺少的精神食粮的一部分，它们用社会主义思想教育了中国人民，苏联作家在中国青年的心中占着多么高、又多么近的地位！）而且比任何小说中所描写的更生动，更具体，更抓住我的心。我真愿意交出我的一切，参加在这个巨大的行列中间，在这个伟大的建设工作中做一个小小的石子甚至一颗砂粒。这时候我才深切地了解从共同的理想、共同的目标和共同的事业中产生的友谊的意义。我更深地爱着苏联和苏联人民像爱自己的祖国和人民一样。我也更深地懂得中苏两大民族的牢不可破的友谊对整个人类的命运有多大的关系。我也更深地明白苏联人民四十年来的光辉的成就对中国人民有多大的影响。
    这不仅是我个人的感受，也不仅是一个中国作家的感受。到过苏联的中国人岂止千千万万！我可以说他们全有这样的感受，也许还有更深、更强的感情的流露，和更多、更浓的友爱的表现。但这也只是程度上的差别，感受还是一样的。我们用不着找多少话来说明中苏人民的血肉相连的关系，这是铁一般的事实。苏联“老大哥”挽住中国弟兄的手在光芒万丈的革命和建设的道路上一同前进。六万万中国人欢欣愉快地度过了自己的第八个国庆节以后，今天又以同样欢欣愉快的心情来迎接伟大的十月社会主义革命的四十周年纪念日。这个大欢乐的日子不单是苏联人民的节日，它还是全世界劳动人民的节日，它还是全体进步人类的节日。
