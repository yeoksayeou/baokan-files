　　Ideological Education Plus Institutional Guarantees
　　Plugging the Loopholes of Capitalism
　　Large-Scale Reforms Implemented in Baitou District and Shayuan Commune, Guangdong, Amidst Great Blooming and Great Debates
　　(Our Dispatch) Reporter Lin Li reports: Large-scale blooming, contending, and debating have been widely launched in the rural areas of Guangdong. Experience has proven that while carrying out large-scale blooming, contending, and debating, it is also necessary to stipulate some systems and methods to restrict capitalism and solve some of the current practical problems that urgently need to be addressed. Without certain rules and methods, it will not be possible to plug the loopholes of capitalism. Without certain rules and methods as a guarantee, ideological education will become an empty shell.

　　Excessive Private Plots and Unlimited Expansion of Private Subsidiary Occupations are Essentially Socialism Nurturing Capitalism

　　Judging from the problems exposed in the blooming and contending, there are still many venues for capitalist activities and ways for individuals to "get rich." Any negligence in work will be exploited by capitalism. The most prominent manifestations at present are excessive private plots, too broad a scope of private subsidiary production, and a lack of necessary leadership and management for individual households. For example, in the Shayuan Agricultural Cooperative in Qujiang County, each farm household had only 0.25 mu of private plot in the early stage of the cooperative's establishment. All the private plots combined accounted for only 5% of the cooperative's land area. However, since August of last year, under the banner of "taking care of private interests," the private plot of each cooperative member has been increased to more than two mu. All the private plots accounted for 16% of the cooperative's land area. The rich middle peasant Cheng Hongji had as many as 13.5 mu of private plot. The Shayuan Cooperative has two relatively large subsidiary occupations – cutting grass and collecting herbs for the brick and tile factory – which account for 80% of the cooperative's subsidiary income. Such concentrated subsidiary production should be managed uniformly by the agricultural cooperative, but they did not do so, and instead gave it to private individuals. As a result, the cooperative members devoted their main energy and most of their time to private plots and subsidiary production. In the past six months, the average monthly attendance rate of each cooperative member was only thirteen days, and they only worked six hours a day. Five able-bodied laborers did not work a single day in a year and a half. Because cooperative members spent more than 60% of their time managing their own production, the agricultural cooperative's grain production decreased, subsidiary industries could not be developed, and the collective income could not keep up with private income. According to statistics, the cooperative members received 24,000 yuan from the cooperative throughout the year, while private income was more than 46,000 yuan. During this year's summer harvest, the cooperative members received 19,000 yuan worth of goods from the cooperative, while private income was as high as 36,000 yuan. The Shayuan Cooperative was not well managed, but it showed unusual calmness in the several waves of withdrawal and dissolution. At the height of the withdrawal wave, only thirty farm households asked to withdraw. People originally thought this was a "good phenomenon." It was not until this large-scale blooming and contending that the real reasons for not withdrawing were clarified. Poor peasants said: "The Shayuan Cooperative is where the barefooted work for the shoe-wearers to eat." Rich middle peasants said: "Since we can develop private capital within the cooperative, why should we withdraw? Moreover, cooperatives have various conveniences and advantages." People combined these two aspects of opinions and said that the Shayuan Cooperative was "selling dog meat under the guise of a sheep's head." It is "socialism nurturing capitalism" – due to excessive private plots and the inappropriate expansion of private subsidiary production, the Shayuan Cooperative no longer resembled a socialist cooperative.

　　Non-Discrimination Against Individual Households Turned Into Preferential Treatment, Individual Households in Baitou District Show Off the Superiority of Individual Farming

　　In Guangdong, the proportion of individual households is already very small. However, these small number of individual households are generally so-called "capable" "talents," so their influence is great. Their every move affects the cooperative members at any time and any place. How to correctly treat individual households is not only necessary for the thorough completion of the rural socialist transformation, but also an important aspect of blocking capitalism. Otherwise, not only will the goal of transforming individual households not be achieved, but there is a danger of being transformed by individual households. In the attitude towards individual households, Guangdong has taken some detours. Generally speaking, during the high tide of cooperativization, there was more spiritual pressure and public opinion attack on individual households. For example, some places openly proposed that individual households are not allowed to take the main road, only allowed to take the small road; some villages and cooperatives do not allow individual households to marry cooperative members, etc. In August last year, the Guangdong Provincial Congress of the Communist Party of China studied the issue of individual households and proposed not to discriminate against individual households in light of the then situation. However, in the past year, many places have implemented "non-discrimination" as various preferential treatments and blind concessions. Therefore, it has seriously affected and continues to affect the consolidation of agricultural cooperatives. For example, in Baitou District, Qujiang County, individual households do not arrange production according to the national plan. The 103 individual households have generally reduced grain production and increased economic crops such as flue-cured tobacco and peanuts. After these economic crops are harvested, they are not sold to the state according to the unified purchase prices, but are retailed at twice the listed price. In the water conservancy projects, individual households do not work, but they are given priority in using water after the projects are completed. When the supply and marketing cooperatives sell fertilizer, they ask the cooperative members of agricultural cooperatives to collect it from warehouses far away; when selling it to individual households, they sell it on the spot, saying "this is to take care of the lack of labor in individual households." Township and cooperative cadres do not interfere with individual households engaging in speculative business and smuggling and tax evasion. …All these have boosted the arrogance of individual households and weakened the enthusiasm of cooperative members. Some individual households raise their thumbs and say: "Cooperative members, let's compare and see if you are superior or I am superior." Some even arrogantly hang the preserved meat they have trafficked at the door to show the superiority of individual farming…

　　Baitou District and Shayuan Commune Take Measures in Large-Scale Blooming and Contending to Plug the Loopholes of Capitalism

　　During the large-scale blooming and contending, Shayuan Commune and Baitou District, while launching the ideological struggle between the two roads, have regarded the struggle to block the capitalist road as an important issue. The Shayuan Commune re-discussed the amount of private plots, re-arranged the ratio of collective subsidiary industries to individual subsidiary industries, and the Baitou District stipulated five measures to restrict capitalism in the name of the government. The main points of these five regulations are: individual households must implement the national plan, complete the state-allocated grain purchase tasks and the purchase tasks of oil, live pigs, etc., and abide by the state's unified purchase and sales policies; individual households must not reclaim wasteland and abandon agriculture to engage in commerce, must not engage in speculative trading and lending at usurious rates; they are not allowed to engage in subsidiary industries and handicrafts that require the use of national resources and hired labor; individual households should bear the social labor of building water conservancy projects, building bridges and roads, and must not enjoy special privileges, etc. …The Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China believes that the method of Shayuan Commune and Baitou District, which combines ideological mobilization and ideological education with the guarantee of laws and regulations, is very good and has educational significance for all parts of the province. Therefore, it has printed and distributed the "Five Regulations" to all parts of the province.

　　思想教育加上制度保证
    堵住资本主义的窟窿
    广东白土区和沙园社在大鸣大争中实行大改
    本报讯　记者林里报道：广东农村的大放大鸣和大争，已经普遍展开。经验证明：在大放大鸣和大争的同时，还必须规定一些限制资本主义的制度和办法，解决一些当前急需解决的实际问题。没有一定的法规和办法，就不能堵住资本主义的窟窿。没有一定的法规和办法做保证，思想教育也将成为架空的东西。
    自留地过多，私人副业无限扩大，实质上是社会主义养资本主义
    从鸣放中所暴露出来的问题看，农村资本主义的活动场所和个人“发财致富”的方法还很多。工作上的任何疏忽大意，都会为资本主义所利用。当前比较突出的表现是自留地过多，私人副业生产的方面太广，对单干户缺乏必要的领导和管理。像曲江县的沙园农业社，建社初期每户农家只有二分五厘自留地。全部自留地加在一起，也只占社内土地面积的5％。但自去年8月以来，人们在“照顾私人利益”的招牌下，把每户社员的自留地增加到了两亩以上。全部自留地竟占了社内土地面积的16％。富裕中农成洪基，自留地竟多达十三亩半。沙园社有两项比较大的副业生产——给砖瓦厂割草和采药——，收入占全社副业收入的80％。这样集中的副业生产，理应农业社统一经营，但他们没有这样做，反而让给了私人。这样一来，社员就把主要精力和大部分时间放到了自留地和副业生产上。近半年间，每个社员的每月出勤率平均只有十三天，而且每天劳动不过六小时。有五个全劳动力，一年半中没有出过一天工。因为社员把60％以上的时间拿去经营自己的生产，所以农业社的粮食减产，副业办不起来，集体收入总赶不上私人收入。据统计：去年全年，社员从社内分到的东西是二万四千元，而私人收入却有四万六千多元。今年夏收，社员从社内分到的东西值一万九千元，私人收入竟高达三万六千元。沙园社没有办好，但在几次的退社、散社风潮中，这里却表现了异乎寻常的平静。退社风潮最严重的时候，要求退社的农家也只有三十户。原来人们以为这是一种“好现象”。直到这次大放大鸣，才弄清了不退社的真实原因。贫农说：“沙园社是打赤脚的做给穿鞋的吃。”富裕中农说：“既然在社内可以发展私人资本，又何必要退社呢？况且，合作社还有各种方便和便宜。”人们把这两方面的意见总合起来，说沙园社是“挂着羊头卖狗肉。”是“社会主义养资本主义”——由于自留地过多，由于私人副业生产的不适当的扩大，沙园社已不像社会主义性质的合作社了。
    不歧视单干户变成优待单干户，白土区单干户炫耀单干优越性
    在广东，单干户的比例已经很小很小了。但这些为数不多的单干户，一般都是所谓“有本事”的“能人”，因此他们的影响很大。他们的一举一动，都随时随地的影响着社员们。如何正确对待单干户，不光是彻底完成农村社会主义改造所必需，而且也是堵塞资本主义的重要方面。否则，不但达不到改造单干户的目的，反有被单干户所改造的危险。在对待单干户的态度上，广东曾经走过一些弯路。一般来说，合作化高潮时期，对单干户的精神压力和舆论打击多了一些。比如说，某些地方公开提出不准单干户走大路，只准走小道；某些村社不准单干户跟社员结婚等。去年8月，中共广东省代表大会上，曾就单干户问题作过研究，针对当时情况提出不要歧视单干户。但是近一年来，不少地方却把“不要歧视”执行成了多种优待和一味迁就。因此就严重地影响了和继续影响着农业社的巩固。像曲江县白土区，单干户不按国家计划安排生产，一百零三户单干户，普遍缩减了粮食生产，而增加了土烟和花生等经济作物。这些经济作物收获后，又不按统购物资卖给国家，反以高于牌价两倍的价格去零售。在兴修水利的工程中，单干户不出工，修好后反优先用水。供销社出售肥田粉，要农业社的社员到很远的仓库里去领取；卖给单干户，便就地卖予，并说“这是照顾单干户的劳动力不足”。单干户做投机生意和走私漏税，乡社干部也不干涉。……所有这些，都助长了单干户的气焰，削弱了社员的积极性。有些单干户就翘着大拇指头说：“社员同志，咱们比比看，你优越还是我优越。”有的竟狂妄地把贩运来的腊肉挂在门口，来显示单干的优越……。
    白土区和沙园社在大鸣大争中，采取措施，堵住资本主义的漏洞
    大放大鸣当中，沙园社和白土区在展开两条道路的思想斗争的同时，都把堵塞资本主义道路的斗争当做了一项重要课题。沙园社重新讨论了自留地的数量，重新安排了集体副业和个人副业的比例，白土区则以政府名义规定了五项限制资本主义的办法。这五项规定的要点是：单干户要执行国家计划，完成国家分配的粮食征购任务和油料、生猪等等的收购任务，服从国家的统购统销政策；单干户不得重荒土地去弃农就商，不得进行投机买卖和放高利贷；不准经营需要动用国家资源和雇工经营的副业和手工业；单干户应负担兴修水利，建筑桥梁道路的社会劳动，不得享有特权等……。中共广东省委认为沙园社和白土区这种双管齐下，既经过思想发动和思想教育，又有了法规制度保证的方法很好，对全省各地都有教育意义。因此已把“五项规定”印发给了全省各地。
