    Old Man Andrei
    Zhong Qiang
    To be honest, I used to have a feeling of respect and awe for Engineer Andrei. I respected him because the old man really knew his stuff. When he talked about technology, he knew technology; when he talked about experience, he knew experience. I don't know how many lifetimes it would take for me to learn as much as he had. I was in awe of the old man because he was really strict with people, always scolding them, which made people feel uncomfortable.
    I remember one morning last winter, I came to the oil well site with my lunchbox to relieve Engineer Andrei for his rest. After handing over the shift, he dragged his tired steps off the drilling platform, his face covered with mud and oil. It seemed that a night of tense work was really tough for the old man. I thought to myself, "He's over fifty years old, it's really not easy. The manager has told us several times not to let him work the night shift, but he insists on working the night shift. There's really no way to deal with him."
    He got off the drilling platform, and I was busy taking care of the overall drilling work, thinking that the old man had probably gone back. Who knew that after a while, the old man came out of the duty room and waved to me: "Technician Lin, let me talk to you about some problems while there's not much going on at the well today!" I said, "Engineer Andrei, how about the lesson tomorrow?" The old man was very unhappy when he heard this: "What? I'm not tired, and you're afraid of trouble?" What else could I say? So, we began the lesson.
    Andrei told us about the principles of drilling deviated wells, and about the methods of surveying the deviation and determining the azimuth. While lecturing, he constantly rubbed his bloodshot eyes. Finally, the lecture lasted for more than an hour. The clock pointed to a quarter past nine.
    "Do you understand?" After finishing the lecture, the old man asked me and several interns as usual.
    "Uh… I understand," I said. In fact, because my Russian was not good, I had not understood some of the things he said. I should have asked, but I couldn't bear to disturb him again, so I had to say vaguely.
    "Then, Technician Lin, conduct a deviation survey now!" Andrei had already put down the chalk and re-ascended the drilling platform with the instrument. I had to do it according to the method Andrei had taught. It could be seen that the old man was satisfied with my operation, and he kept nodding. But in the end, due to a mistake in the formula, the entire calculation result was wrong.
    "Technician Lin, do you really understand?" Andrei looked at me, and I felt my face burning. He said, "You can only score two points this time. How can I hand in this two-point score to the Soviet people when I go back to my country?" So he carefully re-explained the set of principles and methods to us until we could all do it, and then he took the transport car back to the mine. By this time, it was already past eleven o'clock.
    One day, the well site was raising the drill pipe, and Andrei and I were both on the drilling platform. I was facing away from the wellhead, checking the changes in the "weight indicator."
    "Ouch! Get out of the way!" Suddenly, a scream came from behind me. I turned my head sharply and was dumbfounded. I only saw Andrei hugging a drill pipe that was swinging back and forth. I finally understood what was going on: it turned out that the driller had raised the drill pipe too violently, and the drill pipe suddenly swung towards me. If it had hit me, I wouldn't have survived. Andrei immediately jumped up and held the drill pipe tightly, so that the drill pipe did not swing over and hit me. But because the swing force of the drill pipe was very large, it dragged him and two drillers across the turntable. His cotton pants were torn, and he had several injuries on his legs.
    One weekend evening, a serious drill sticking accident occurred on the well. Several times I called the chief engineer, but I couldn't get through. I had to come back to find him, but he was still nowhere to be found. I was very anxious. When I walked past the expert's dormitory, I suddenly saw Andrei limping out with his wife. He had just come out of the hospital, and his leg was not fully recovered. In the light, he quickly recognized me: "Technician Lin, let's go dancing!"
    "No, I'm not going."
      "Why don't young people dance? When I was your age, I used to dance all night! You see, my leg is not fully recovered yet, but I still want to dance. Anyway, it will get better if I dance!" Old Man Andrei said cheerfully.
    "I have something to do," I said. He seemed to have discovered my worries and carefully examined me from head to toe, finally seeing clearly that I was wearing greasy work clothes: "Did you just come back from the well?"
      "Yes, the drill is stuck on the well," I nodded, involuntarily blurting out the truth. After saying that, I immediately regretted it, feeling that telling him these things would cause him anxiety because his leg had not recovered. I turned to leave.
      "Technician Lin, stop!" He called me to a halt, carefully asked me about the accident on the well, and immediately sent his wife and children back, and rode with me to the well. The old man ran to the drilling platform and started operating himself. He hoisted the drill string for a while, lowered it for a while, and turned the turntable for a while. This continued until six o'clock in the morning, and finally the accident was resolved. At this time, I took a deep breath and felt a weight lifted off my mind.
    Who knew that not long after, I heard that he was going back to his country. Unfortunately, I was working on the well when the farewell party was held. When I thought that Old Man Andrei had to get up early the next morning to catch the train, I felt very anxious. Just then, a car crossed several mountain ridges and stopped at our well site. Old Man Andrei came, he hugged me, touched my oil-stained work clothes, and said to me in not-so-fluent Chinese: "Little Lin, come to Baku to see me in the future." He shook my hand tightly, and when he let go, I suddenly felt something cold in my hand. It turned out to be a big red apple. The old man laughed heartily and cheerfully: "Eat it! This was specially brought to you from the party." I stared at Old Man Andrei for a long time, unable to say a word.

    安德烈老人
    仲强
    老实说，以往我对安德烈工程师是存着一种敬而畏的心情。敬的是这老头确是有一套，讲起技术有技术，讲起经验有经验，不知道我要到哪辈子才能学得那么多。畏的是这老头子，对人着实严格，动不动就刮人的胡子，使人感到难受。
    记得去年冬天的一天早晨，我提着饭盒子来到了油井场上，换安德烈工程师回去休息。交完班后，他拖着疲乏的步子走下钻台去，脸上涂满了泥浆和机油，走了十几步连着打了几个呵欠，看来一夜紧张的工作，对老人来说可真够呛的了。我心想：“五十几岁的人了，真不简单。经理曾好几次地嘱咐过，不要让他上夜班，但他偏偏要上夜班，真拿他没办法。”
    他走下钻台，我忙着照顾全面的钻井工作，以为老人大概回去了。谁知一会儿老头子从值班房走出来，向我招手：“林技术员，趁着今天井上的事情不多，给你们讲些问题吧！”我说：“安德烈工程师，课放到明天上好吗？”老头子一听见这话，很不高兴了：“怎么？我不累，你们还怕麻烦吗？”我还有什么话说呢，于是便开始上课了。
    安德烈给我们讲关于打斜井的原理，关于测斜和定方位的方法。讲课的时候，他不断地用手揉擦着充满了血丝的眼睛。这样终于上了一个多小时的课。时针指着九点一刻。
    “明白了吗？”讲完了，老人照例又问我和几位实习生。
    “呵……明白了。”我说，其实由于我的俄文不好，有些话还没有听清楚，本来是应该问一问的，但我不忍再打搅他，只好含糊地说。
    “那么，现在由林技术员进行一次测斜吧！”安德烈已经丢下了粉笔，提着仪器矫健地重新走上钻台了。我只好照着安德烈讲的方法做着。可以看得出老头子对我的操作是满意的，他不断地点着头。可是最后计算时，由于套错了一个公式，整个计算结果搞错了。
    “林技术员，你真的明白了吗？”安德烈看着我，我感到脸上只发烧。他说：“你这次只能打两分。我拿着这两分成绩，回国去怎么向苏联人民交卷呢？”于是又把这套原理和方法，给我们仔细地重新讲了一遍，一直让我们会做了，他才坐交通车回矿去。这时，已经是十一点多了。
    有一天，井场上正在起钻，我和安德烈都在钻台上，我背朝着井口，检查着“指重表”的变化情况。
    “哎哟！快闪开！”忽然从背后传来一声尖叫，我猛回头一看，这下子可把我惊傻了，只看见安德烈死抱住一根来回摇摆着的钻杆。我终于明白是怎么回事了：原来是司钻提钻杆时太猛了，钻杆猛地向我打来，如果要是打着我，那就别想活命了。安德烈立刻跳上去，死死地抱住钻杆，使得钻杆没有摆过来打我。但由于钻杆的摆动力很大，把他和两个钻工，拖过了转盘，他的棉裤撕烂了，腿上负了好几处伤。
    一个周末的晚上，井上发生了严重的卡钻事故。几次给总工程师摇电话，都没有摇通。只好回来找，还是找不见，我很焦急，当我走经专家宿舍的时候，忽然看见安德烈一拐一拐地和他的老伴走出来。他才从医院出来，腿还没有全好。在灯光下，他很快地就认出我了：“林技术员，跳舞去吧！”
    “不，我不去。”
      “年青人为什么不跳舞呢？我像你这样的年纪，常常跳通宵呢！你瞧我现在腿还没有全好，我还是要跳，反正跳跳就会好的。”安德烈老人兴高采烈地说。
    “我还有点事。”我说。这下他好像已发现了我的心事似的，把我从头至脚仔细地审视了一遍，终于看清了我穿着的油腻的工作服：“你才从井上回来吗？”
      “嗯，井上卡钻了。”我点了点头，不由得把真情说出来了。说完后，我立刻后悔了，觉得给他讲这些情况，他的腿还没有好，会引起他的不安，我转身就走。
      “林技术员，站住！”他把我叫住了，仔细地问了我井上的事故情况，立刻把老伴和孩子打发回去，和我一道坐车赶到井上来。老头跑到钻台去，亲自动手操作起来。一会儿上提钻具，一会儿又下放，一会儿又转动着转盘。这样一直到清早六点多，终于解除了事故。这时，我才深深地吸了一口气，心上掉下了一块石头。
    谁知道时过不久，便听说他要回国了。偏巧开欢送晚会时，我正在井上工作。我一想到安德烈老人明儿清早就要起来赶火车，心里便怪着急的。正在这时候，一辆小汽车翻过了几个山岭，在我们井场上停下来了。安德烈老人来了，他拥抱着我，摸着我穿着油污的工作服，用不太熟练的中国话对我说：“小林，将来到巴库来看我。”他紧紧地握着我的手，当他松手时，我忽然觉得手上有个冰凉的东西，原来是一只大红的苹果。老人哈哈地开朗地笑着：“吃吧！这是特地从晚会上给你带来的。”我久久地望着安德烈老人，一句话也说不出来。
