Five Poems
Guo Moruo
The Yangtze River Bridge (Note)

A band of iron has fastened the Yangtze River's waist,
It has been completed two years ahead of schedule today.
A poet compared it to a dongxiao flute,
I think that comparison is too delicate.
Ordinary people also like to compare it to a long rainbow,
I think that is also not particularly good.
A long rainbow is a semi-circular arc,
The old-style arch bridge is still a rough resemblance,
But this is a broad and open straight line.
A long rainbow is layered with colors, vanishing in an instant,
But this is a steel structure, forever strong.
Now I'm comparing it to a belt,
Is that good? No, not really.
Then let me say it without embellishment:
It is incomparable, don't waste your energy,
It is, it is, a Yangtze River Bridge!
The ancients once said: the Yangtze River is a natural barrier,
A natural boundary between the South and the North.
Although some people wanted to prevent military advances on the water,
Blocking it with thousand-fathom iron chains across the river,
They ultimately could not withstand Wang Jun's war junks.
Although some people reined in their horses by the river,
Claiming they could sever the rolling torrent with a thrown whip,
They only earned a reputation for panic and defeat at Mount Bagong.
Recalling the capture of Wuhan during the Northern Expedition,
I also had such a thought:
To write a large slogan across the river --
"Down with imperialism, eradicate feudalism!"
But this fantasy was in vain.
Please tell me, where could you find
A platform to write this slogan at that time?
It has been thirty years since the Northern Expedition,
My beautiful dream has finally come true,
It is no longer difficult to write the slogan,
However, the rule of imperialism and feudalism
Was completely overthrown eight years ago.
"The Chinese people have stood up!"
Chairman Mao's declaration has resounded in all directions.
"The Chinese people have stood up!"
Chairman Mao's declaration has resounded in all directions.
The Chinese people thank the Party, support the Party, love the Party,
It is the Party that has thoroughly liberated the productive forces of the people.
The achievements of the past eight years are truly magnificent,
Through the Three Great Transformations and the Five Great Movements,
China has completely changed its appearance.
The Party is the savior of the Chinese people,
The Party is the sun of the People's China.
China is a democratic family of nationalities,
Six hundred million people are like brothers and sisters.
Under the leadership of the Party, the whole people struggle together,
Even the Yangtze River's natural barrier has been bridged,
Who says there is a gap between the Party and the masses,
Who says there is a wall between the Party and the masses?
The Yangtze River Bridge is a milestone in eight years of construction,
Has history ever seen such magnificent construction?
Although the Great Wall is a world wonder,
Its existence is only as ruins of war.
Of course, we also have the Yellow River Bridge and the Qiantang River Bridge,
But the difficulty of the engineering cannot compare to this.
The Yangtze River Bridge is a new type of double-layered construction,
The lower level is for the railway, the upper level is for automobiles.
The railings on the upper level allow people to look out,
Everywhere there are diamond-shaped carved panels, engraved with scales, feathers, flowers,
National form, national style, national flavor,
Everything is simple, generous, dignified, elegant, and magnificent.
At both ends of the main bridge are a pair of bridgeheads,
Nine stories high with stairways that allow you to walk with vigor.
The elevator ascends and descends to the purple sky in an instant,
Making people feel open-minded and high-spirited,
Not only swallowing the Yunmeng swamps, but also embracing all things.
Whenever night falls, people linger on the bridge,
The lights of ten thousand homes in the three towns of Wuhan shine brightly.
Chang'e in the moon must be regretting,
She sees that today's human world is ten thousand times brighter than heaven.
At this time, the Yangtze River Bridge becomes a fire dragon,
But it accompanies the phoenix and the parrot, unwilling to fly away.
Turtles and snakes that have been separated for hundreds of millions of years
Are tightly united, stretching out their iron arms.
The fish and turtles in the river must also be rejoicing and dancing,
Celebrating the leap of the new era, forgetting to return home.
The new appreciation is unprecedented,
The new appreciation evokes new intoxication.
The Yellow Crane Tower will increase its loftiness,
The Qingchuan Pavilion will increase its tranquility.
If the poet Li Bai were born today,
He would create new poems, no shame to Cui Hao.
He would sing the praises of the people's power overcoming nature,
Truly making high mountains bow their heads and rivers give way.
If the musician Bo Ya were born today,
He would play the industrialization march,
Not only aspiring to high mountains, aspiring to flowing water.
Who says the Party cannot lead?
Look at this Yangtze River Bridge!
Who says achievements are not the main thing?
Look at this Yangtze River Bridge!
Who says Soviet technology is not superb?
Look at this Yangtze River Bridge!
Who says the Sino-Soviet alliance is unnecessary?
Look at this Yangtze River Bridge!
Without the leadership of the Party and the help of the Soviet Union,
How could this bridge be built so quickly, economically, and well?
This bridge is a road from north to south, from south to north,
This bridge is also a road to socialism.
The five-star red flag shines on the bridgehead fort,
Attracting pedestrians and vehicles on the bridge,
Also attracting ships and sails under the bridge,
Not at all arrogant, not at all impatient,
Together towards the bright dawn of communism.

Note: On September 25th, this newspaper published President Guo Moruo's poem "Yangtze River Bridge." Recently, he accompanied Indian Vice President Radhakrishnan to the South and personally saw the Yangtze River Bridge. Therefore, he made some revisions and additions to the original. Now, along with the author's other four new works, they are published below.
-- Editor

Qiantang River Bridge

This is my first time at the Qiantang River Bridge,
The setting sun shines on the tender yellow, surging river.
The Six Harmonies Pagoda is emitting a red smile,
As if saying: this place is even better than West Lake.
Suddenly, the whole bridge shook violently,
It turns out there is also a tunnel under the river.
A south-bound train is passing through the tunnel,
This adds a dramatic flavor.
If it were just a scene of tranquility of the landscape,
It would not deeply stir my heart.
It is labor that transforms nature and society,
Making the landscape radiate the light of life.

A Mountain
--Presented to Indian Vice President Radhakrishnan

In the past, a mountain flew from India,
Taking root on the edge of West Lake in Hangzhou.
This mountain increased the beauty of West Lake,
This mountain represents the distant friendship between China and India.
Today, another mountain has flown from India,
The mountain's name is Radhakrishnan.
Although this mountain will fly back to India again,
We weave it into Hangzhou brocade.
In this way, this mountain will also remain in Hangzhou,
And will soon spread to the world.
For the happiness and safety of mankind,
I hope this mountain will remain in the world for a long time.

The Goddess of West Lake

It is said that there is a goddess in West Lake,
Who appears from the heart of the lake every moonlit night.
If the people touring the lake like her,
They are lured into the blue sky in the lake.
Fortunately, there is no moon on the lake tonight,
I did not see the goddess of West Lake.
It is not that I was lured into the waters of West Lake,
It is that West Lake has permeated my heart.

Waves and Clouds

The blue waves stretch out countless pale hands,
Constantly pursuing the white clouds in the sky.
The white clouds leisurely roam in the sky,
Only casting shadows of laughter, unwilling to stay.
The white clouds drift beyond the sky in an instant,
The cloud shadow has been swallowed into the heart of the waves.
The pale hands of the waves continue to stretch out,
The turbulence will never cease.

### 诗五首
郭沫若

    诗五首
    郭沫若
    长江大桥（注）
    一条铁带拴上了长江的腰，
    在今天竟提前两年完成了。
    有位诗人把它比成洞箫，
    我觉得比得过于纤巧。
    一般人又爱把它比成长虹，
    我觉得也一样不见佳妙。
    长虹是一个半圆的弧形，
    旧式的拱桥倒还勉强相肖，
    但这，却是坦坦荡荡的一条。
    长虹是彩色层层，瞬息消逝，
    但这，是钢骨结构，永远坚牢。
    我现在又把它比成腰带，
    这可好吗？不，也不太好。
    那吗，就让我不加修饰地说吧：
    它是难可比拟的，不要枉费心机，
    它就是，它就是，一座长江大桥！
    古人曾经说过：长江是天堑，
    是南方和北方的天然界限。
    虽然有人想阻止水上的进军，
    封锁以千寻的横江铁链，
    但终于抵挡不住王浚的楼船。
    虽然也有人勒马临江，
    放言滚滚洪流、投鞭可断，
    但只赢得风声鹤唳、败退八公山。
    回想北伐当年攻下了武汉，
    我也曾做过这样的想念：
    横江写他一个大标语——
    “打倒帝国主义，铲除封建！”
    但这空想也只是徒然。
    请问，在当时你能从哪儿
    找得出写上这个标语的台栈？
    北伐以来整整三十年了，
    我的美梦竟终于实现，
    要写上标语已经毫不困难，
    然而帝国主义和封建主义的统治
    早已在八年前被彻底推翻。
    “中国人民已经站起来了！”
    毛主席的宣告已响遍四方八面。
    “中国人民已经站起来了！”
    毛主席的宣告已响遍四面八方。
    中国人民感谢党、拥护党、爱党，
    是党把人民的生产力彻底解放。
    八年来的成就真是万丈光芒，
    经过三大改造、五大运动，
    使中国完全改变了模样。
    党是中国人民的救星，
    党是人民中国的太阳。
    中国是民族的民主大家庭，
    六亿人民就和兄弟姊妹一样。
    在党领导下全民共同奋斗，
    连长江天堑都已经架上桥梁，
    谁说党群之间有什么沟，
    谁说党群之间有什么墙？
    长江大桥是八年建设的里程碑，
    历史上的建设几曾有这样雄伟？
    万里长城虽然是世界的奇观，
    但它的存在只是作为战争的废垒。
    当然，我们也有黄河大桥、钱江大桥，
    但工程的艰巨，两者都不能比配。
    长江大桥是双层的新式建筑，
    下桥敷设铁路，上桥可通汽车。
    上桥的栏杆可供人凭眺，
    处处有菱形雕板，刻着鳞毛花卉，
    民族形式，民族气派，民族风味，
    一切都朴素、大方、庄严、典雅、壮美。
    正桥的两端都有桥头一对，
    其高九重有梯道可让你健步如飞。
    电梯的升降更瞬息上下紫微，
    使人们心胸开阔、气宇轩昂，
    不仅气吞云梦，直欲含宏万汇。
    每当夜幕垂空，人们在桥上低回，
    武汉三镇的万家灯火，遍地明辉。
    想那月里嫦娥一定在发生后悔，
    她看到今日的人间比天上光明万倍。
    在这时长江大桥变成了一条火龙，
    但它伴随着凤凰和鹦鹉不想高飞。
    亿万年被隔断着的龟和蛇
    紧紧地团结了起来，伸张着铁臂。
    江里的鱼龟也一定在欢欣鼓舞，
    庆贺新时代的飞跃乐而忘归。
    新的欣赏是前无古人，
    新的欣赏引起新的陶醉。
    黄鹤楼将要增加它的崔巍，
    晴川阁将要增加它的静美。
    诗人李白如果生在今天，
    他会产生出新的诗篇，于崔颢无愧。
    他会歌颂人民的力量战胜了自然，
    真正是使高山低头、江河让位。
    琴师伯牙如果生在今天，
    他会弹奏出工业化进行曲
    不仅仅志在高山、志在流水。
    谁说党不能领导？
    请看这长江大桥！
    谁说成绩不是主要？
    请看这长江大桥！
    谁说苏联的技术并不高超？
    请看这长江大桥！
    谁说中苏联盟可以不要？
    请看这长江大桥！
    如果没有党的领导、苏联的帮助，
    这座桥怎能建设得又快、又省、又好？
    这座桥是由北而南、由南而北的大道，
    这座桥也是通往社会主义的大道。
    五星红旗在桥头堡上辉耀，
    招引着桥上的行人车辆，
    也招引着桥下的船舶帆篙，
    一点也不虚骄，一点也不急躁，
    一同走向共产主义的明朝。
      注：9月25日本报曾登载郭沫若院长的“长江大桥”一诗，最近他陪同印度副总统拉达克里希南博士到南方，亲自看了长江大桥，因此对原作有了一些修改和补充。现在连同作者的另外四首新作一并发表于下。
                          ——编者
    钱塘江大桥
    第一次来到钱塘江大桥，
    夕阳照着嫩黄的江水滔滔。
    六和塔在发出红色的微笑，
    好像在说：这儿比西湖还好。
    忽然间全桥剧烈地震摇，
    原来江底下还有一条隧道。
    隧道中在通过南行的火车，
    这可增加了戏剧性的味道。
    如果只是江山的一片静美，
    不会深刻地鼓动我的心扉。
    是劳动改造了自然和社会，
    使江山焕发出生命的光辉。
    一座山
    ——赠印度副总统拉达克里希
    南博士
    从前从印度飞来了一座山，
    落根在杭州西湖湖边。
    这座山增加了西湖的美丽，
    这座山表示着中印友谊的悠远。
    今天从印度又飞来一座山，
    山的名字就叫拉达克里希南。
    这座山虽然又要飞回印度，
    但我们把它织成杭州的锦缎。
    这样，这座山也会留在杭州，
    而且很快地会向世界传遍。
    为了人类的幸福和安全，
    希望这座山长远留在人间。
    西湖的女神
    据说西湖里有一位女神，
    每逢月夜便要从湖心出现。
    游湖的人如果喜欢了她，
    便被诱引向湖中的青天。
    今晚的湖上幸好没有月，
    我没有看见西湖的女神。
    不是我被诱进西湖的水底，
    是西湖被透进了我的心。
    波与云
    碧波伸出无数次的皓手，
    向天上的白云不断追求。
    白云高高地在天上逍遥，
    只投下些笑影不肯停留。
    白云转瞬间流到了天外，
    云影已被吞进波的心头。
    波的皓手仍在不断伸挐，
    动荡不会有止息的时候。
