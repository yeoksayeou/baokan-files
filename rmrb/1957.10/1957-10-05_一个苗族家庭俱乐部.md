    Recently, I visited a Miao family known as the "Home of Music." This family lives in a small valley between high mountains. As soon as you enter the house, you are greeted by a dazzling array of musical instruments hanging on the walls. This is the "Family Club" of Wang Chuangji's family of the Miao ethnic group in Moji Township, Longlin Autonomous County of various ethnic groups, Guangxi Province.

    That evening, thirteen-year-old little zither player Wang Yamao returned from herding cattle and picked up the flute to play. After dinner, as usual, the family ensemble performed. The instruments used in the performance included the moon guitar, flute, erhu, and lusheng, and the sound of the music echoed for a long time in the high mountains.

    The Wang Chuangji family has twelve members, and everyone except his daughters-in-law and grandchildren (five people) can play musical instruments. Wang Chuangji and his wife are skilled Miao singers, and his six children (the eldest daughter Yaping is already married) can play five or six tunes on the moon guitar and more than a hundred tunes on the flute. The eldest son, Wang Wuji, learned to play the moon guitar at the age of eight and has not missed a single night in the past twenty years. In addition to teaching his siblings, he has also taught more than a dozen young people in the village. Wang Wuji's wife married him because of his good zither playing.

    This "Family Club" was formed in 1953 with the support of the county cultural center. In the same year, they attended the Baise area folk art performance for the first time and received favorable comments from the audience. In January of this year, they attended the folk art performance of the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Prefecture and the province, and won the first prize for instrumental ensemble. Subsequently, they were selected to go to Beijing to participate in the National Folk Art Performance.

    一个苗族家庭俱乐部
    新华社记者　黄义杰
    最近记者访问了被称为“音乐之家”的一个苗族家庭。这个家庭，住在高山间的一个小峝场里。一走进房子，挂在墙上的各种乐器琳琅满目。这就是广西省隆林各族自治县磨基乡苗族王创济家的“家庭俱乐部”。
    当天黄昏，十三岁的小弹奏手王亚茂放牛回来，便拿起笛子演奏。晚饭后，照例举行家庭合奏队表演。表演的乐器有月琴、笛子、二胡和籚笙，乐声经久不散地回旋在高山间。
    王创济全家大小十二口人，除了他的儿媳和孙儿等五人外，其他人都会弹奏。王创济夫妇是苗歌能手，他的六个儿女（大女亚平已出嫁）都能用月琴弹出五、六种曲调，用笛子吹出一百多种曲子。老大王伍济八岁起就学会了弹月琴，二十年来没有一个晚上间断。他除教会了兄弟姊妹外，还教会了乡里十多个青年。王伍济的妻子也是因为他的琴弹得好而嫁给他的。
    这个“家庭俱乐部”，是1953年在县文化馆的扶助下组成的。同年第一次出席了百色地区民间文艺会演，获得观众们的好评。今年1月，又出席桂西僮族自治州和省的民间文艺会演，荣获乐器合奏一等奖。接着，被推选去北京，参加了全国民间文艺会演。
