The Necessity of Birth Control as Seen from Housing and Wage Issues

I.

In recent years, workers' lives have improved and been elevated on the basis of production development.

In 1956, the average wage of workers at the Shanghai State-owned No. 2 Cotton Mill increased by 45.03% compared to 1950. The average annual wage of all workers in the factory was 573 yuan in 1950, which increased to 831 yuan in 1956.

The housing situation of workers has also improved. In recent years, 845 people have moved into workers' residences such as Cao Yang New Village, and 490 single workers have moved into newly built single dormitories.

From 1951 to 1956, a total of 9,940 people enjoyed subsidies in accordance with labor insurance regulations, with a total of 349,509.17 yuan in labor insurance funds spent over the six years.

The number of employed family members of workers has also increased. In 1956 alone, 319 family members of workers joined the factory.

This year, among the 5,335 workers in the factory, 4,997 purchased public bonds, with a purchase amount of 129,416 yuan, averaging about 25.9 yuan per person. As of July this year, 3,513 households had savings in the bank, with a total savings amount of 240,000 yuan, averaging 68.5 yuan per person, with some workers having savings of over 1,000 yuan.

The improvement of workers' lives can also be seen from the fact that workers are requesting to build houses with public assistance. This year, a total of 148 people in the factory want to build houses with public assistance, of which 33 households want to build one house. The cost of building a house is more than 2,600 yuan, and the workers have to pay 780 yuan at once, with the remainder being deducted from their wages in installments over four to five years.

It can be seen from this that the lives of workers have definitely improved since liberation.

II.

However, there are still several problems in the lives of workers that need to be resolved.

First, among the 5,335 workers in the factory, there are currently 720 households requesting housing solutions. In addition to the 142 households building their own houses with public assistance and 100 households being allocated by the factory, there are still 478 households remaining. Among these 478 households, 151 households can borrow money to repair their existing houses. The remaining 327 households include those who are married but live separately in single dormitories because they cannot rent a house; those who have rented other people's houses and the landlord wants to take them back; those who live by the river, where the houses are small and dangerous; and those who have too many people in their families and simply cannot live in their current homes.

On the other hand, there are 1,942 workers in the factory who rent houses from others, of which 24 people pay monthly rent between 15 and 53 yuan, which seriously affects their lives.

In addition, there are still 103 workers in the factory living in plank houses, 10 people living in sheet metal houses, and 276 people living in thatched houses. Some workers live next to the Suzhou River, and during typhoons, tides, or heavy rains, water floods into their houses, posing a risk of collapse.

Second, from the perspective of workers' lives, according to statistics from April 1956, there were 253 workers in the factory whose average monthly income per person was below 10 yuan; 1,450 workers whose average monthly income per person was between 10 and 15 yuan; and 2,865 workers whose average monthly income per person was above 15 yuan.

Many workers whose average monthly income per person is below 10 yuan are in debt and have difficulty making ends meet because they do not manage their expenses carefully. From January to July this year, a total of 1,601 people borrowed money from the factory. Last year, the factory subsidized 3,191 people, with a subsidy amount of more than 440,000 yuan; this year, as of June, more than 1,200 people have been subsidized again.

III.

There are many reasons for these problems in the lives of workers. For example, there is a shortage of houses, which is also due to the poor living conditions of workers in the old society, making it impossible to improve them all at once. It is also related to the fact that many family members of workers have moved from rural areas to cities. The relatively tight economic situation of some workers is related to whether they can reasonably arrange their lives and how many family members are employed. However, population growth is also an important factor.

Below are the birth statistics of workers in recent years:

Year　Total female workers　Percentage of total workers　Number of babies born
1953　3022　63.08%　658
1954　2946　61.58%　774
1955　2835　60.27%　619
1956　2896　62.45%　616
1957 (up to July) 3203 382

From the above birth statistics, from 1953 to July 1957, 3,049 babies have been born, which is almost equal to the total number of female workers currently in the factory. Compared with 1946 before liberation, the birth rate in 1956 has almost tripled.

Now let's look at the birth situation of female workers:

Total number of female workers: 3,203
Number of those who have given birth to one child: 266
Number of those who have given birth to two children: 302
Number of those who have given birth to three children: 350
Number of those who have given birth to four children: 326
Number of those who have given birth to five children: 272
Number of those who have given birth to six children: 279
Number of those who have given birth to seven children: 196
Number of those who have given birth to eight children: 132
Number of those who have given birth to nine children: 108
Number of those who have given birth to ten or more children: 130

Let's look at the birth situation of the national textile industry labor model小组 Yishi Juan小组:

This team has a total of 31 people, and 24 of them are married.
Among them, 20 people got married after liberation, mostly around 1952. In the past few years, they have given birth to 81 children, averaging more than three children per person.

Sun Yamei in this team got married after liberation and now has five children. Yuan Yonglan, a female worker in the cloth machine workshop, got married at the time of liberation and has given birth to five children, and is currently pregnant with another child. Generally, female workers have two or more children every three years or so.

The birth rate of female workers is high, and on the other hand, the infant mortality rate has decreased. Before liberation, many children died of measles, diphtheria, smallpox, dysentery, and whooping cough, but today, children dying of these diseases are only isolated cases.

Because the birth rate of many workers has been very high in the past few years since liberation, the problem of insufficient housing and difficult living conditions has arisen or expanded among these workers, or at least affected the improvement of their lives.

Let's start with the housing problem! Many workers had only four people, including husband, wife, and children, when they first moved into workers' residences in 1953, but in the past three years, the number of children has increased by two or three, and some families have also hired nannies due to the increase in the number of children, so one room is not enough. Let's look at the current overcrowding in workers' residences:

Cao Yang No. 1 Village 55 rooms 294 people
Ganquan No. 2 and No. 3 Village 615 rooms 2845 people
Cao Yang No. 4 Village 13 rooms 73 people
Yichuan No. 2 Village 60 rooms 315 people

On average, each room has about five people. Currently, those who apply for housing due to a large family population account for 40%-50% of all those who want housing.

Let's look at the living conditions! Take Zhu Xiaolian (deputy foreman) and Yuan Yonglan (assistant) in the cloth machine workshop as examples. Their monthly salary is about 180 yuan. They got married in the early days of liberation and have given birth to five children in a row. Now they are pregnant again. Currently, the average monthly consumption level per person is just over 22 yuan (there is also a nanny in the family). If they had only three children during the same period, the average consumption level per person could be increased to 30 yuan. A small number of workers have difficulty in their family life due to the increase in population. Sun Yamei, mentioned earlier, has a family of seven people living on her salary alone (monthly income of more than 70 yuan). In total, from January to June this year, there were 414 workers in the factory who needed subsidies due to a large family population and difficult living conditions, accounting for about one-third of the number of people subsidized.

The high birth rate of female workers has also brought some other contradictions and problems. For example, the absenteeism rate caused by gynecological diseases was 6,824 workdays in 1956, ranking first among all diseases that caused absenteeism. Some workers suffer from poor health due to multiple births, busy housework, poor living conditions, and malnutrition. Some female workers cannot learn culture because they have many children. Some young female workers also have reduced political ambition after getting married, having children, and being busy with housework.

IV.

In recent years, the rate of wage growth and the rate of dormitory increase for workers are unprecedented in our country's history. If workers can have planned births, their lives will be quite affluent. Otherwise, like the Shanghai State-owned No. 2 Cotton Mill, where the number of children born in more than four years is almost equivalent to the total number of female workers in the factory, the improvement of life cannot but be affected. Because neither the speed of production, accumulation, nor wage growth can be so fast.

Therefore, the final conclusion is that birth control must be vigorously promoted. Only by achieving planned births can the increase in wages and the increase in the construction of dormitories bring real improvements in the lives of workers.

    从住宅和工资问题看节育的必要
  　一
    几年来，在生产发展的基础上，工人的生活是改善了、提高了。
    1956年，上海国棉二厂职工的平均工资比1950年增长了45.03％，1950年全厂职工的全年平均工资是五百七十三元，1956年提高到八百三十一元。
    职工的居住情况也改善了。几年来有八百四十五人住进了曹杨新村等工人住宅，单身工人有四百九十人住入了新建的单人宿舍。
    从1951年到1956年，共有九千九百四十人按劳保规定享受补助，六年中共支出劳保金三十四万九千五百零九元一角七分。
    职工家属就业人数也增加了，只1956年就有三百一十九名职工家属进厂工作。
    今年在全厂五千三百三十五个职工中，有四千九百九十七人认购了公债，认购数字达十二万九千四百一十六元，平均每人约二十五元九角。到今年7月份止，在银行中存款的有三千五百一十三户，储蓄金额二十四万元，平均每人在银行中储蓄了六十八元五角，有的职工存款达千元以上。
    职工生活的改善，还可以从职工要求自建公助造房子这件事上看出来。今年全厂共有一百四十八人要自建公助造房子，其中造一幢的有三十三户，一幢房子的造价要二千六百多元，职工要马上一次付款七百八十元，其余在四到五年中每月从工资中分期扣清。
    由此可见，解放以来职工生活肯定地是提高了。
  　二
    但是目前职工生活中还有几个问题需要解决。
    第一，全厂五千三百三十五个职工中，目前共有七百二十户要求解决房子问题。除自建公助一百四十二户、厂里分配一百户外，还剩四百七十八户。这四百七十八户中有一百五十一户可以借钱修缮一下。其余的三百二十七户，有的是结了婚因租不到房子而分别住在单人宿舍里；有的是租了别人房子到期房主要收回去；有的是住在河滨，房屋狭小，且有危险；有的是家中人口太多，实在住不下。
    另一方面，在职工中租赁别人房屋的有一千九百四十二人，其中有二十四人每月房租在十五——五十三元之间，严重地影响生活。
    此外，全厂职工中还有一百零三人住板房，有十人住铅皮房，有二百七十六人住草房，有的职工住苏州河旁，每到台风和潮汛季节，或大雨期间，水浸进屋里，有倒塌的危险。
    第二，从职工生活来看，据1956年4月份的统计，全厂职工中每户每人平均每月在十元以下的有二百五十三人；平均在十——十五元的有一千四百五十人；平均在十五元以上的有二千八百六十五人。
    很多平均每人每月在十元以下的工人，由于开支掌握不严，弄得欠债、生活困难。从今年1月到7月，共有一千六百零一人向厂内借钱。去年工厂补助了三千一百九十一人，补助金额达四十四万多元；今年到6月份止又补助了一千二百多人次。
  　三
    职工生活中存在这些问题，原因是很多的。如房子不够，也由于旧社会工人居住条件太差，不可能一下子全部改善，同时与很多职工家属从农村迁入城市也有关系。有些职工的经济情况比较紧张，同会不会合理安排生活，家庭就业人口多少都有关系。但是，人口增长也是其中一个重要的因素。
    下面是几年来职工的生育情况：
    年份　全厂女　占全厂职工　生小
          工人数　总数  　％　孩数
    1953　 3022     63.08   　658
    1954　 2946　　 61.58　   774
    1955　 2835　　 60.27　 　619
    1956　 2896　 　62.45　 　616
    1957（到七月份止）3203　382
    从上述生育情况来看，从1953年到1957年7月份，已生了三千零四十九个小孩，差不多等于全厂现有的女工总数。1956年和解放前的1946年相比，生育率几乎增加三倍左右。
    现在再看看女工的生育情况：
      全厂女工人数　  3203人，
      其中生育一胎的 　266人
      生育二胎的　 　　302人
      生育三胎的　 　　350人
      生育四胎的　　 　326人
      生育五胎的　 　　272人
      生育六胎的　　 　279人
      生育七胎的　　 　196人
      生育八胎的　　 　132人
      生育九胎的　  　 108人
      生育十胎以上的　130人
      再看看全国纺织工业劳动模范小组裔式
  娟小组的生育状况：
      这个组共三十一人，已有二十四人结婚，
  其中二十人是解放以后结婚的，大都在1952年前后，几年来已生育了八十一个小孩，平均每人生三个以上。
    这个小组里的孙雅妹，解放后才结婚，现已有五个小孩。布机车间女工袁永兰，解放时结婚，已生了五个小孩，目前又有一小孩即将出世。一般女工都是三年左右养二个以上。
    女工的生育率高了，另一方面婴儿的死亡率却降低了。解放前，儿童死于麻疹、白喉、天花、痢疾、百日咳的很多，而今天，儿童死于这些疾病仅仅是个别的了。
    由于解放几年来许多职工的生育率很高，因此在这些职工中就产生或扩大了房子不够住和生活困难的问题，至少是影响了生活的改善。
    先从居住问题来说吧！许多职工在1953年刚搬进工人住宅时，只有夫妻和孩子四人左右，但三年以来，孩子增加了二、三个，有的家中因孩子增加又雇用了保姆，因此一间房子就不够住了。我们看看目前工人住宅的拥挤现象：
        曹杨一村　     55间　住294人
        甘泉二、三村　615间　住2845人
        曹杨四村     　13间　住73人
        宜川二村　     60间　住315人
    平均每间房子都在五人左右。目前因家庭人口多而申请要房的占全部要房子人的40％—50％。
    再看生活情况吧！拿布机车间朱孝廉（副工长）和袁永兰（相帮）二人来说，每月工资是一百八十元左右，解放初结婚，婚后连生五个小孩，现在又怀孕了，目前按人口平均计算，每月每人消费水平是二十二元多一点（家中还有一个保姆）。如果在同一时期只生育三个小孩的话，每人平均消费水平就可提高到三十元。有少数职工因人口增加而使家庭生活发生困难。前面说的孙雅妹同志，家里七口人靠她一人工资生活（每月收入七十多元）。总计从今年1月到6月，全厂因家中人口多、生活困难需要补助的职工有四百一十四人，占被补助人数的三分之一左右。
    女工生育率高还带来了其他一些矛盾和问题。如因妇科疾病而造成的缺勤率，在1956年有六千八百二十四个工作日，在造成缺勤率的各科疾病中占第一位。有些职工由于生育多，家务操作繁忙，生活不好，营养不良，影响了身体的健康。有些女工因子女多无法学习文化。有的青年女工也因结婚后生了孩子又忙于家务，降低了政治进取心。四
    几年来，职工工资增长的速度和宿舍增加的速度，是我国历史上从来没有的。如果职工能够有计划地生育，生活是相当丰裕的。否则，像上海国棉二厂这样，四年多生的小孩差不多相当于全厂女工的总数，生活的提高就不能不受到影响。因为无论是生产、积累和工资的增长速度，都不可能有这样快。
    因此，最后的结论是，必须大力提倡节育。只有做到有计划的生育，增长工资和增造宿舍才能给职工带来真正的生活改善。
