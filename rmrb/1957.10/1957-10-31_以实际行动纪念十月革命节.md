    Commemorate the October Revolution Day with Practical Actions
    Guo Yu'en
    The great achievements of our country's socialist construction are inseparable from the help of the Soviet Union. Especially in agricultural production, the production volume has been increasing year by year due to learning from the Soviet Union's advanced management methods. Pingshun County has achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest this year despite the drought, and our cooperative has also achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest. On the one hand, this is due to the hard work of the members, and more importantly, learning from the Soviet Union's advanced quota management system, soil tillage system, and close planting of crops. The output of our cooperative has greatly increased this year, averaging 450 jin per mu, an increase of 74 jin per mu compared with last year. The total income from agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline occupations is 48,210 yuan, an increase of 20.3% compared with last year, exceeding the output of the first five-year plan by 10 jin per mu. When we were busy harvesting from morning till night, all the members, in order to commemorate the great October Revolution Day with practical actions and respond to the Party's call for careful harvesting and threshing and returning every grain to the home, democratically formulated a careful harvesting and threshing plan. Everyone carried a pocket and picked up any stray seeds, requiring an extra five jin per mu to make up for the deficiency. At the same time, the production teams launched an autumn harvest competition to strive to complete the autumn harvest tasks ahead of schedule, deliver good public grain, and sell surplus grain well, so as to support the country's construction with practical actions and greet the great October Revolution Day.

    以实际行动纪念十月革命节
    郭玉恩
    我国建设社会主义的伟大成就是和苏联的帮助分不开的，特别是农业生产方面，由于学习了苏联先进的经营管理办法，生产量逐年在提高。平顺县今年在旱灾的年头里获得了空前的农业大丰收，我社也同样获得了空前大丰收。这一方面是由于社员辛勤的劳动，更重要的是学习了苏联的先进的定额管理制度、土壤耕作制、作物密植等经验。我们社里今年的产量大大提高，每亩平均达四百五十斤，比去年每亩增产七十四斤。农、林、牧、副业总收入为四万八千二百一十元，比去年提高20.3％，比第一个五年计划的产量每亩超过十斤。当我们起早贪黑地忙于收秋的时候，全体社员为了以实际行动纪念伟大的十月革命节，响应党提出的细收细打颗粒还家的号召，民主制订了细收细打计划。人人带口袋，见籽拾起来，要求每亩多收五斤，以丰补欠。同时各个生产队开展了秋收竞赛运动，争取提前完成秋收任务，交好公粮，卖好余粮，以实际行动来支援祖国建设，迎接伟大的十月革命节。
