    Nanyang Institute of Xiamen University Achieves Results in Research Work

    The Nanyang Institute of Xiamen University has achieved certain results in its research work in the year since its official establishment in October last year.

    The Nanyang Institute of Xiamen University was established according to the instructions of the Central Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission and the Ministry of Higher Education. The establishment of the institute has received strong support from overseas Chinese, overseas Chinese leader Mr. Chen Jiageng, and domestic overseas Chinese affairs agencies. The institute is currently the only research institution in China that studies the issue of overseas Chinese in Nanyang. The main task of the institute is to study the scientific issues related to overseas Chinese in Nanyang (Southeast Asia) and the countries where they reside. At present, the institute has nearly forty professional staff (including the Museum of Anthropology). In addition, some well-known domestic scholars and experts are invited to participate in the research work.

    According to the instructions of the Central Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission in February this year, the focus of the institute's work in the next two years is to research and write a history of overseas Chinese in Nanyang (including the history of Sino-South relations). According to this instruction, the institute is currently conducting some research on the history of overseas Chinese in Nanyang (including the history of Sino-South relations). Meanwhile, since March, it has been carrying out the first phase of historical data collection and compilation, starting to collect relevant information from Chinese and foreign books, magazines, ancient Chinese series, encyclopedias, historical books, local chronicles (including those of Fujian and Guangdong provinces), various collections of essays, genealogies, etc., and making cards as the basis for future compilation of the history of overseas Chinese in Nanyang. In addition, five investigations were conducted in overseas Chinese hometowns to understand valuable materials related to overseas Chinese in order to enrich the materials for compiling the history of overseas Chinese in Nanyang.

    Some of the institute's data has been compiled into volumes. A quarterly magazine entitled "Translated Materials on Nanyang Issues," which contains reference materials on the history of overseas Chinese in Nanyang, has been published with three issues already released. A "Index of Special Papers on the History of Overseas Chinese in Nanyang," with about 8,000 entries, has been compiled and bound. The editing work for the first issue of the "Index of Newspaper and Periodical Materials on Nanyang Issues" (quarterly) has also been completed, with a total of more than 7,000 entries. In the future, an index of charts and tables related to the history of overseas Chinese in Nanyang will also be compiled. In order to further develop the research work, the institute attaches importance to the accumulation of data. There are currently more than 4,500 books, with 566 books purchased in the third quarter of this year alone. Forty-four maps of various Nanyang countries. 173 kinds of newspapers. 149 kinds of magazines. In addition, there are some rare and out-of-print books, documents, photos, etc.
