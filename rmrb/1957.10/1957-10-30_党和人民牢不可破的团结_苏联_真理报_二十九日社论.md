	On the eve of the fortieth anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution, the people of our country look back with patriotic pride on the path they have traveled during the years of Soviet power. This is a path of struggle and victory, a path of glorious historical achievements that have completely changed the face of our motherland, changed its economy and culture, and transformed the formerly backward Russia into a powerful socialist country.

	On the entire path of victory won by the people of all nationalities in the world's first socialist country, the Communist Party, as a voluntary fighting alliance of like-minded communists striving to transform human society based on Marxism-Leninism, has always been and remains the leader, inspirer, and organizer of the people of all nationalities. Lenin created and consolidated the Communist Party, making it a great leading force in the struggle of the working people for national freedom and happiness, and for communism. The Communist Party has gloriously fulfilled this glorious and important role at every stage of its glorious history.

	Our Party unites the working class and all the most advanced, bold, heroic, and self-sacrificing people in the people, and embodies the fundamental interests of millions of working people.

	The great strength of our Party lies in its Marxist-Leninist theory, in the iron unity of its ranks, and in its close ties with the broad masses of the people.

	Historical experience proves that without a Communist Party that enjoys high moral prestige among the millions of working people and is loved, trusted, and respected by them, the Party established and nurtured by Lenin, it would have been impossible for the Russian workers and peasants to overthrow the Tsarist system and capitalism, to obtain and defend Soviet power, and to build socialism in the Soviet Union. The enthusiastic words in the slogans celebrating the October Festival aptly express the feelings and thoughts of the Soviet people.

	Glory to the leader of the October Revolution, the great inspirer and organizer of our socialist and communist construction—the Communist Party of the Soviet Union!

	The Communist Party has no other interests than the interests of the people. The Soviet people have always expressed unlimited trust in their Party, supported the Party's policies, and regarded these policies as their own, in line with their heartfelt thoughts and wishes. In times of peaceful construction or in times of severe war tests, whenever the country faced extremely important historical tasks, the Communist Party always called on the people, correctly explained the situation at that time to them, pointed out the path to victory, and mobilized them to establish labor and battle achievements.

	In the early years of the establishment of Soviet power, when the imperialists invaded the fruits of the October Revolution, the Communist Party called on the people to rise up and carry out a just, revolutionary war of national defense to resist foreign interventionists and domestic counter-revolutionaries. Hundreds of thousands of workers and peasants responded to the Party's call and volunteered to join the Red Army. Under difficult conditions, the Soviet people and their army mustered all their strength, overcame immense difficulties, demonstrated miraculous heroism and a high degree of ideology, and finally defeated the enemy and achieved victory.

	After the end of the domestic war, the Communist Party mobilized the people of our country to restore the damaged economy and to implement Lenin's program of socialist construction. Surrounded by hostile capitalism, the Soviets, under the leadership of the Party, were not afraid of hardships and advanced with confidence, creating a great cause of socialist transformation of their motherland; this is an unparalleled example and model. They realized the national industrialization, the agricultural collectivization and completed the cultural revolution.

	Thanks to the construction achievements of the Party and the people, our country has become an advanced industrial-collective farm socialist country. In the process of socialist construction, the consolidated alliance of the working class and the peasants and the great strength of the friendship of all nationalities of the Soviet Union were clearly demonstrated. The fraternal friendship of all nationalities of the Soviet Union is the solid foundation of the Soviet system and the source of the power of our multinational socialist country. When our motherland faced a dangerous moment, the Soviet people responded to the call of the Communist Party to resist the fascist aggressors and carried out the great Patriotic War. The Soviet people gloriously defended the fruits of the October Revolution, the freedom and independence of the Soviet motherland, gloriously fulfilled their mission of liberation, and saved the people of many countries from fascist enslavement. Under the leadership of the Communist Party and its Central Committee, the Soviet people and their heroic armed forces achieved a victory of world historical significance in the Great Patriotic War. Mankind will never forget the great combat and labor achievements of the Soviet people and their armed forces in the anti-fascist war.

	Responding to the call of the Party and under the leadership of the Party, the Soviet people quickly healed the wounds of war, restored all sectors of the socialist economy, and confidently pushed them forward. At present, our country is one of the most powerful countries in the world, a country with advanced technology and science. With the active support of the people of the whole country, the Party has proposed and successfully solved many tasks to further develop industrial and agricultural production and improve the material welfare and cultural level of the working people.

	The Soviet people accepted the resolutions of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union with great excitement and spared no effort and labor to implement these resolutions. The working people of our country unanimously support the Party's reform of industrial and construction management, because this will promote greater production and give greater play to the creative initiative of the masses. Millions of Soviets are currently engaged in a tenacious struggle to fulfill the Party's task of catching up with the United States in the production of meat, milk, and oil per capita in the coming years.

	The victorious realization of the tasks put forward by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in the past and present convincingly proves that all the slogans and initiatives and all the resolutions of the Party are in line with the fundamental interests of the working class, peasants, and intellectuals of our country. The Soviet people express enthusiastic support for our Party's domestic and foreign policies.

	The strength of our Party lies in the ideological and organizational unity of the Party ranks. Throughout its heroic history, the Party has waged a resolute struggle to win unity and oppose all kinds of anti-Party groups and factions. Based on experience, the Soviet people believe that the Leninist unity of the Party is the most important condition for the Party to conduct effective activities to benefit the working people. The Party and the people unanimously support the resolution of the June Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on condemning the divisive activities of the anti-Party group of Malenkov, Kaganovich, Molotov, and Shepilov who participated in their gang.

	The unbreakable unity of the Party and the people is a reliable guarantee of the strength of socialist society and a guarantee of the victorious construction of communism. The Soviet people are closely united around the beloved Communist Party and confidently move from victory to victory.

	Soviet working people! The unity of the Communist Party and the people is the source of the strength of the socialist system and the guarantee of new achievements in communist construction! Long live the unbreakable unity of the Party and the people!

    党和人民牢不可破的团结
    ——苏联“真理报”二十九日社论
    在伟大的十月社会主义革命四十周年的前夕，我国人民怀着爱国主义的自豪心回顾他们在苏维埃政权年代里走过的道路。这是斗争和胜利的道路。是获得光荣的历史性成就的道路，这些成就彻底改变了我们祖国的面貌，改变了它的经济和文化；把过去落后的俄国变成了强大的社会主义国家。
    在世界上第一个社会主义国家的各族人民获得胜利的整条道路上，作为根据马克思列宁主义改造人类社会而奋斗的志同道合的共产主义者的自愿战斗联盟的共产党，从前是现在仍然是各族人民的领导者、鼓舞者和组织者。列宁缔造了和巩固了共产党，使它成为劳动人民争取民族自由和幸福、争取共产主义的斗争中的伟大的领导力量。共产党在自己光荣历史的各个阶段都光采地实现了这个光荣而重要的作用。
    我们党把工人阶级和人民中一切最先进的、最大胆英勇和不怕自我牺牲的人团结在自己的队伍里，体现了千百万劳动人民的根本利益。
    我们党的强大力量就在于它的马克思列宁主义理论，在于自己队伍的钢铁般的团结，在于同极广大的人民群众的紧密联系。
    历史经验证明，没有一个在千千万万劳动人民中享有崇高的道义威信，受他们爱戴、信任和尊敬的共产党，列宁所建立和培养起来的党，俄国工人和农民不可能推翻沙皇制度和资本主义，不可能获得和保卫住苏维埃政权，不可能在苏联建成社会主义。庆祝十月节口号中的热情的字句恰如其分地表现了苏联人民的感情和思想。
    光荣属于十月革命的领导者、我国社会主义和共产主义建设的伟大鼓舞者和组织者——苏联共产党！
    共产党除了人民的利益就没有其他利益。苏联人民过去和现在始终对自己的党表示无限的信任，支持党的政策，认为这种政策是他们自己的、符合他们的衷心思想和愿望的政策。在和平建设时期或是严酷的战争考验时期，每当国家面前摆着极重要的历史任务的时候，共产党总是去号召人民，向他们正确地解释当时的局势，指出取得胜利的道路，发动人们去树立劳动功勋和战功。
    在建立了苏维埃政权的最初几年中，帝国主义者曾来侵犯十月革命的胜利果实，共产党就号召人民起来进行正义的、革命的卫国战争，抵抗外国干涉者和国内反革命。数以十万计的工人和农民响应党的号召，志愿参加了红军。苏联人民和他们的军队在艰苦的条件下鼓起全部力量，克服无比的困难，表现了奇迹般的英雄主义和高度的思想性，终于打败了敌人，取得了胜利。
    国内战争结束后，共产党发动我国人民去恢复遭到破坏的经济，去实现列宁的社会主义建设纲领。在敌对的资本主义包围的环境里苏联人在党的领导下不怕艰难困苦，满怀信心地前进，创立对自己祖国进行社会主义改造的伟大事业；这是举世无双的范例和榜样。他们实现了国家工业化、农业集体化，完成了文化革命。
    由于党和人民的建设功绩，我国已经成为一个先进的工业—集体农庄社会主义的国家。在社会主义建设的过程中，明显地表现了工人阶级和农民的巩固联盟和苏联各民族友谊的伟大力量，苏联各民族的兄弟友谊是苏维埃制度牢固的基础、我们多民族的社会主义国家的威力的源泉。当我们祖国面临着危险的时刻，苏联人民响应了共产党的号召起来反抗法西斯侵略者，进行了伟大的卫国战争。苏联人民光荣地保卫住了十月革命的果实、苏维埃祖国的自由和独立，光荣地执行了自己的解放者使命，拯救了许多国家的人民，使他们免于法西斯的奴役。苏联人民和他们的英勇的武装部队在共产党及其中央委员会的领导下，在卫国战争中取得了世界历史意义的胜利。人类永远也不会忘记苏联人民和他们的武装部队在反法西斯战争中的伟大的战斗和劳动功绩。
    苏联人民响应党的号召，并且在党的领导下很快地医治了战争创伤，恢复了社会主义经济的一切部门并且满怀信心地把它们推向前进。目前，我国是世界上最强大的国家之一，是一个具有先进技术和科学的国家。在全国人民积极支持下，党提出并且顺利地解决着许多任务，以进一步发展工农业生产、提高劳动人民的物质福利和文化水平。
    苏联人民怀着十分兴奋的心情接受了苏联共产党第二十次代表大会的决议，并且不惜一切力量和劳动来实现这些决议。我国劳动人民一致拥护党实行的工业和建筑管理的改组，因为这样会促使生产更加提高，使群众创造积极性得到更大的发挥。成百万的苏联人目前为完成党所提出的要在最近几年在按人口计算的肉类、奶类和油类的产量方面赶上美国的任务而进行顽强的斗争。
    苏联共产党过去和现在所提出的任务的胜利实现，令人信服地证明党的一切口号和倡议以及一切决议都是符合我国工人阶级、农民和知识分子的根本利益的。苏联人民对我们党的国内政策和外交政策表示热烈支持。
    我们党的力量是在于党的队伍在思想上和组织上的统一。党在它的全部英勇的历史中，都为争取团结、反对各种反党的集团和派别而进行了坚决的斗争。苏联人民根据经验相信，党的列宁主义团结是党进行有效活动以造福劳动人民的最重要条件。党和人民一致拥护苏联共产党中央委员会六月全体会议关于谴责马林科夫、卡冈诺维奇、莫洛托夫以及参加他们一伙的谢皮洛夫的反党集团的分裂活动的决议。
    党和人民的牢不可破的团结是社会主义社会强大有力的可靠保障，是胜利建设共产主义的保证。苏联人民紧密地团结在亲爱的共产党的周围，满怀信心地从胜利走向胜利。
    苏联劳动人民！共产党和人民的团结是社会主义制度力量的泉源，是共产主义建设获得新成就的保证！党和人民的牢不可破的团结万岁！
