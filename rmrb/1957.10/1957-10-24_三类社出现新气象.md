New Atmosphere in Third Category Cooperatives

The Weizhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Beidun Dai Township, Daxing County, Hebei Province, was a third-category cooperative with a poor work foundation. This spring, bad elements instigated some backward members to try to ruin the agricultural cooperative and take the capitalist road, resulting in more than 800 mu of good land not being planted. Since strengthening socialist education in rural areas and carrying out large-scale debates, the masses' awareness has been greatly improved. Members who were previously unwilling to join the cooperative have now brought their rubber-wheeled carts to invest in the cooperative. The wealthy middle peasants who were unwilling to work in the past are now vying to work. The 820 mu of good land that was abandoned has been readjusted for the cultivation area and replanted with wheat.

    三类社出现新气象
    河北省大兴县北顿垈乡魏庄农业生产合作社，是一个三类社，工作基础差，今年春天坏分子策动一部分落后社员企图把农业社搞垮，去走资本主义道路，因而八百多亩好地没能种上庄稼。自加强农村的社会主义教育和开展大辩论后，群众的觉悟大大提高。过去不愿在社里的社员也将胶轮拿到社里投资了，过去不愿干活的富裕中农现在也抢着干活了，所荒废的八百二十亩好地也都重新调整了耕作区抢种上麦子。
