Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 5th: Eight large sugar factories in Guangdong Province, namely Shunde, Dongguan, Zini, Shitou, Zhongshan, Nanhai, Beijie, and Huiyang, which process one thousand to three thousand tons of sugarcane daily, have successively launched the "Big Blooming and Big Airing" campaign among their employees.

During the "Big Blooming and Big Airing," employees in each factory express their opinions through various means such as big-character posters, discussion meetings, individual conversations, and freely formed "Big Blooming and Big Airing" groups. The criticisms and opinions cover a wide range of areas, including enterprise management, financial work, welfare, ideological style of leading cadres, and mutual opinions among employees. The vast majority of opinions call for actively improving work and running socialist enterprises well.

The factory leaders in each factory highly value the criticisms and opinions put forward by the employees, and have established dedicated bodies to study and handle them. Employees at the Zini Sugar Factory criticized the factory leaders for poor production management, noting that the loading pier, costing 10,000 yuan, was built without a canopy, leaving it exposed to the elements. After criticism via a big-character poster, the factory director immediately consulted the higher-level authorities and decided to resolve the problem quickly. Of the 2,382 opinions raised by the factory's employees, more than 500 have already been addressed and resolved. The factory has also proposed time-limited improvement measures based on the magnitude and urgency of the problems. After analyzing and studying the more than 800 opinions put forward by the employees, the leaders of the Shunde Sugar Factory have also addressed and resolved more than 100 of the major issues. The water used by employees at the Zhongshan Sugar Factory was very dirty, requiring alum to be used before it could be consumed. This problem had not been resolved for a long time, and everyone had many opinions. Now, the factory leaders have decided to build a water filtration pond in October to ensure clean water for employees.

    设置专门机构处理群众建议
    紫坭厂根据问题的缓急采取限期改进办法
    新华社广州5日电　广东省顺德、东莞、紫坭、市头、中山、南海、北街和惠阳等八家日榨一千到三千吨甘蔗的大糖厂，目前已先后在职工中展开了大鸣大放。
    各厂职工在鸣放中纷纷通过大字报，座谈会，个别交谈，以及三五成群自由组合的鸣放小组等形式，表达自己的意见。批评和意见涉及的范围很广，企业管理、财务工作、生活福利、领导干部思想作风和职工间相互意见等都有，绝大多数意见都是要求积极改进工作、办好社会主义企业。
    各厂领导很重视职工提出的批评意见，都成立了专门机构进行研究和处理。紫坭糖厂职工批评厂的领导生产管理不善，价值一万元的落糖码头建成后没有搭天棚，任凭风吹雨打。经大字报批评后，厂长即请示上级主管部门，决定很快解决这个问题。这个厂职工提出的二千三百八十二条意见已经处理得到解决的有五百多条。工厂还根据问题的大小缓急，提出了限期改进的办法。顺德糖厂领导分析研究了职工提出的八百多条意见后，也已处理和解决了其中较大的问题一百多条。中山糖厂职工使用的水很污浊，要下白矾才能用，这个问题长期没有解决，大家意见很多。现在厂的领导已经决定在10月份内兴建滤水池，保证职工用水清洁。
