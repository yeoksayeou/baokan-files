　　“Residents” in the Air
　　Gao Shiqi
　　For a long time, people did not understand what air was. Some believed that a subtle gas called phlogiston filled the air. It was released from substances through combustion, and without it, combustion could not occur.
　　This theory was overturned in the eighteenth century by the experiments of the great Russian scholar Lomonosov. Later, the great French chemist Lavoisier discovered oxygen and nitrogen, and the truth about air began to be revealed. Today, scientists can completely analyze the contents of air.
　　It turns out that air is a large mixture of various substances, including gases and solid particles.
　　In the ocean of gases, nitrogen accounts for about four-fifths; oxygen accounts for about one-fifth; argon accounts for about one percent; carbon dioxide accounts for about one ten-thousandth, and there are also helium, neon, krypton, xenon, etc. These rare gases account for only a very small amount in the air.
　　Water vapor is also a gas! Its distribution is very uneven. When it encounters cold, it condenses into clouds, rain drops, frost, dew, snow, and hail.
　　The gases mentioned above are all colorless, odorless, and tasteless, inherent in the air. They are all ordinary "residents" of the air and contribute to humans to varying degrees.
　　Oxygen is the supporter of respiration and combustion, and the life of animals and plants cannot be separated from it. It is also an oxidation engineer, needed by many industrial sectors. In steel plants, it directly participates in ironmaking and steelmaking.
　　To extract large amounts of oxygen, air must first be turned into liquid, and then oxygen must be separated from other gases one by one. This requires large and complex equipment, high pressure, and a large consumption of energy. Currently, our country can manufacture large and medium-sized oxygen generators.
　　Recently, Soviet science has made brilliant achievements in this area. Newer and newer machines are constantly being invented, which can not only separate various components in the air in large quantities, but also extract them very purely.
　　Nitrogen is the organizer and manufacturer of food and fertilizers. The proteins of animals and plants are all nitrogen compounds. People can not only use decaying proteins to make fertilizers, but also use electricity to turn nitrogen in the air into ammonia and nitric acid.
　　Nitrogen is also very much needed in factories that manufacture explosives. Like oxygen, nitrogen is becoming more and more widely used.
　　Carbon dioxide is a nutrient needed by plants. Together with water, it can produce starch through photosynthesis by chlorophyll. It is also a master of fire extinguishing, and people use it to put out flames. It can also make dry ice, providing people with cold air and refrigeration.
　　Helium is the technician of balloons and airships. People fill it in balloons and airships, so they can rise to high altitudes. Using helium, people can also obtain the lowest temperature in the world.
　　Argon, neon, krypton, and xenon are the masters of electric lights and neon lights. They live in light bulbs and tubes, and emit various beautiful and bright lights when electricity passes through.
　　In addition to the gases mentioned above, the air also contains several rarer and less common gases, namely radioactive gases, namely radon (also called radon) and gases emitted by the transmutation of light metals. Their lifespans are very short; some are only a few days; some are only a few seconds; some are less than one millionth of a second. Radioactive gases produced by atomic fission all over the world also travel in the air.
　　In addition, there are some gases that come to the air from the ground and the interior of the earth; some are emitted from volcanoes, hot springs, and mines; some are produced in factories and residences. Some of these foreign molecules are toxic and harmful, such as chemical toxic gases such as carbon monoxide and hydrogen sulfide. Their existence cannot be concealed from chemists. They are destroyers of cells and blood cells, posing a great threat to the lives of humans, animals and plants.
　　Floating in the ocean of air, there are also countless solid particles, which are so-called dust-like things. They are all wanderers in the air, carried far away by the wind. Scientists can still find their traces at an altitude of 20,000 meters above sea level. Some of these dusts are inanimate; such as soot, stone powder, sand, charcoal ash, feathers, dander, cotton wool, willow catkins, etc.; some are animate; such as seeds, pollen, and various microorganisms, most of which are harmless, and only a very small number are reactionary. These include viruses and bacteria of diphtheria, scarlet fever, whooping cough, measles, pneumonia, influenza, colds, tuberculosis, and pneumonic plague. They lurk in dark and humid rooms or mix in crowded places. When the weather suddenly turns cold and resistance decreases, they take the opportunity to rise up, frantically attack the human respiratory tract, set fires everywhere, and cause infectious disease disasters.
　　Chemical toxic gases and viruses and bacteria are the "rightist elements" in the air. They are mixed in the "residents" of the air and cannot be detected by the naked eye. If they are not exposed early, strictly prevented, and thoroughly and cleanly eliminated, the health and safety of human life cannot be guaranteed. We must be vigilant.

### 空气中的“居民”

　　空气中的“居民”
　　高士其
    有一个很长的时期，人们对于空气是什么，并不了解，有的人认为：充满在空气里是一种微妙的气体叫做燃素，它是某种物质经过燃烧而放出来的，没有它，就不会发生燃烧的作用。
    这种说法，在十八世纪中，就为俄国伟大的学者罗莫诺索夫的实验所推翻。后来，法国大化学家拉瓦锡发现了氧和氮这两种气体，空气的真相才开始被暴露。到今天，科学家们已经能把空气的内容完全分析出来了。
    原来空气是各种物质的大混合，其中有气体，也含有固体微粒。
    在气体的海洋中，氮约占五分之四；氧约占五分之一；氩约占百分之一；二氧化碳约占万分之一，还有氦、氖、氪、氙等，这些稀有气体，只占空气中的极少量。
    水蒸气也是一种气体吧！它的分布很不平均，当它遇冷的时候，会凝结成云雾、雨点、霜露、雪花和冰雹。
    以上所讲这些气体，都是无色、无臭、无味的东西，为空气中所固有，它们都是空气中的普通“居民”，对于人类或多或少都有一定的贡献。
    氧是呼吸和燃烧的支持者，动植物的生命都离不开它。它也是氧化的工程师，有许多工业部门都需要它；在钢铁厂里，它直接参加了炼铁和炼钢的工作。
    人们要提取大量的氧，先得把空气变成液体，然后把氧和其他气体一一分离出来，这需要庞大而复杂的装置，要用很大的压力和消耗很大的能量。目前，我国已能自制大型和中小型的制氧机了。
    最近，苏联科学对这方面的研究，有了辉煌的成就，新而又新的机器不断地在发明，不但能够大量地分离空气中的各种成分，而且能够提取得非常纯净。
    氮是食物和肥料的组织者和制造家，动植物的蛋白质都是氮的化合物。人们不但能利用腐败的蛋白质来制造肥料，而且能用电力把空气中的氮变成氨和硝酸。
    在制造炸药的工厂里，也非常需要氮，氮和氧一样，越来越得到广泛的应用。
    二氧化碳是植物所需要的养分，它和水在一起，经过叶绿素的光合作用，能制造淀粉。它还是灭火的能手，人们用它来扑灭火焰。它又会制造干冰，供给人们冷气和冷藏之用。
    氦是气球和飞艇的技术员，人们把它装在气球和飞艇里面，它们就能上升到高空中去。利用氦，人们还可以得到世界上最低的温度。
    氩、氖、氪、氙是电灯和霓虹灯的主人，它们住在灯泡和灯管里面，通过电流就会放出各种各色美丽而明亮的光辉。
    除了上面所讲过的气体以外，空气里还含有几种更稀少更不常见的气体，这就是放射性气体，这就是镭射气（又叫做氡）和轻金属脱变而放射出来的气体。它们的寿命都很短；有的只有几天；有的只有几秒钟；有的不到百万分之一秒。全世界原子核分裂后所产生的放射性气体，也在空气里游行。
    此外，还有一些气体，是从地面和地球内部投奔到空气中来的；有的从火山、温泉和矿井发出；有的在工厂和住宅产生，这些外来分子，有的是有毒有害的，例如一氧化碳、硫化氢之类的化学毒气，它们的存在是瞒不过化学家的。它们都是细胞和血球的破坏者，给人类和动植物的生命以莫大的威胁。
    飘浮在空气的海洋里面，还有无数固体微粒，这就是所谓灰尘之类的东西，它们都是空气中的流浪者，随着大风而远颺，科学家在离海面二万公尺的高空，还能找到它们的踪影。这些灰尘，有的是无生命的；如煤烟、石粉、沙土、炭灰、羽毛、皮屑、棉絮、柳丝等等；有的是有生命的；如种子、花粉以及各种微生物，其中大多数是无害的，仅有极少数是反动的，这些包括白喉、猩红热、百日咳、麻疹、肺炎、流行性感冒、伤风、肺结核、肺鼠疫之类的病毒和病菌，它们潜伏在阴暗潮湿的房间里，或混杂在人群拥挤的场所，当天气骤然变冷和抵抗力减弱的时候，它们就乘机起事，向人体呼吸道猖狂进攻，到处点火，造成传染病的灾祸。
    化学毒气和病毒病菌之类的东西，就是空气中的“右派分子”，它们混在空气的“居民”里边，非肉眼所能觉察，如果不及早揭发，严密地加以防范，彻底地干净地把它们清除出去，人类的健康和生命的安全就得不到保障。我们不能不提高警惕。
