(Xinhua News Agency, 20th) China's water conservancy construction embodies Sino-Soviet friendship. The help of Soviet experts and learning and applying the advanced experience of the Soviet Union according to China's actual conditions are important factors for the rapid progress of China's water conservancy cause.

　　Compiling comprehensive river basin plans to systematically control water disasters and develop water conservancy resources is one of the many advanced experiences China has learned from the Soviet Union. Conducting basin planning for river management and development is fundamentally different from scattered water disaster management and independent water conservancy development. It determines the direction and steps of management and development, selects large-scale water conservancy construction projects, and stipulates the direction of small and medium-sized projects in different regions within the basin, so as to comprehensively utilize water resources to meet the needs of flood control, irrigation, power generation, navigation, and industrial and urban water use. In the past, China had no experience in compiling such basin plans. Soviet experts working in China have provided us with assistance. They not only introduced the methods of compiling basin plans but also personally participated in the compilation of many basin plans. The comprehensive plan for eradicating the Yellow River water disaster and developing Yellow River water conservancy, completed in 1954, and the Sanmenxia Water Conservancy Hub Project were both made with the help of the Soviet government and Soviet experts. Thanks to the help of Soviet experts, by this year, the first drafts of the Huai River and Liao River basin plans and the Hai River basin planning outline have also been completed; the Yangtze River basin planning outline is about to be completed; and the Songhua River and Pearl River basin plans are in progress. Now, all parts of the country are learning and applying the advanced experience of compiling basin plans, and the planning work for some small and medium-sized rivers has been launched. In recent years, more than 90 basin plans for small and medium-sized rivers with a basin area of ​​less than 10,000 square kilometers and large-scale regional water conservancy plans have been compiled and completed. These plans have played a powerful guiding role in local water conservancy construction.

　　In recent years, Soviet experts have helped with the dozens of large-scale dams, reservoirs, and other projects built in the Huai River, Yangtze River, Yellow River, Hai River, and Liao River basins, from surveying, design, to construction. Soviet advanced experience and science and technology are important reasons why these projects can be completed in a relatively short period of time and achieve cost-effectiveness.

　　In hydrology, soil, hydrogeology and engineering geology, soil and water conservation, farmland irrigation, and water conservancy scientific research, relevant departments and scientific and technical personnel in China have also widely learned and applied the advanced experience and advanced science and technology of the Soviet Union, and have achieved results.

　　Thanks to the help of Soviet experts and the continuous learning of the advanced experience and advanced science and technology of the Soviet Union in actual work, now, except for some particularly major projects, the basin planning of general rivers, or large-scale sluices, reservoirs, and hydropower stations, and large-scale irrigation projects, from design to construction, can basically be completed by China's own engineering and technical personnel.

    我国水利建设凝结着中苏友谊
    江河规划将陆续完成，技术水平也有了很大的提高
    据新华社20日讯  我国的水利建设事业凝结着中苏友谊。苏联专家的帮助和根据我国实际情况学习、运用苏联的先进经验，是我国水利事业获得飞跃进展的重要因素之一。
    编制江河综合性的流域规划，以便有计划地治理水害和开发水利资源，是我国向苏联学得的许多先进经验中的重要的一项。对江河的治理和开发进行流域规划，同分散地治理水害和各自为政地开发水利有原则的区别，它确定治理、开发的方向和步骤，选定大型水利建设项目，规定流域内不同地区的中小型工程方向，以便综合利用水利资源，满足防洪、灌溉、发电、航运以及工业、城市用水等各方面的要求。编制这样的流域规划，在过去，我国根本没有经验。来我国工作的苏联专家对我们进行了帮助，他们不仅介绍了编制流域规划的方法，而且亲自参加了许多的流域规划的编制工作。1954年完成的根治黄河水害和开发黄河水利的综合规划，以及三门峡水利枢纽工程，都是由苏联政府和苏联专家的帮助作出的。由于苏联专家的帮助，到今年，淮河、辽河的流域规划初稿及海河流域规划要点也已完成；长江流域规划要点即将完成；松花江和珠江的流域规划正在进行。现在全国各地都在学习和运用编制流域规划的先进经验，各地对一些中小河流的规划工作已经展开，几年来已经编制完成的流域面积在一万平方公里以内的中小河流流域规划和大面积地区水利规划已有九十多项，这些规划对各地的水利建设都起了有力的指导作用。
    几年来，我国在淮河、长江、黄河、海河和辽河等江河流域兴修的几十项大型闸坝、水库等工程，从勘查、设计到施工，都有苏联专家的帮助；苏联的先进经验和科学技术是这些工程能在较短时期内完工并能做到费省效宏的重要原因之一。
    在水文、土壤、水文地质和工程地质、水土保持、农田灌溉和水利科学研究等方面，我国的有关部门和科学技术人员也广泛地学习和运用了苏联的先进经验和先进科学技术，并且都得到了成效。
    由于苏联专家的帮助和在实际工作中不断地学习苏联的先进经验和先进科学技术，现在，除一些特别重大工程以外，一般江河的流域规划，或是大型的水闸、水库和水电站以及大型灌溉工程，从设计到施工，基本上都可由我国的工程技术人员自己完成。
