According to the Fujian Daily, the Luoyuan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, in accordance with the spirit of streamlining the upper levels and strengthening the grassroots, transferred sixty-two cadres familiar with rural work from county and district-level organizations to the townships to serve as township-level party and government leaders. Over the past few months, they have closely connected with the masses and participated in and led production, bringing a new atmosphere to the county's rural areas.

The vast majority of people, after arriving at their new posts, have shared weal and woe with the masses, worked actively, and have been deeply praised by the masses. Lin Yuquan, the former member of the Yangbing District Committee, after arriving in Guilin Township, joined the farmers in rolling up his trouser legs, taking off his shoes, and going down to the fields to work. He also patiently helped the agricultural cooperative to clear up and publish its accounts. Since then, the cooperative's accounts have been made clear and settled daily. The cooperative members have expressed great satisfaction with this new director. Liu Zhaohao, the former deputy director of the County Party Committee's Organization Department, took the post of Party Branch Secretary in Gangtou Township. Because he rectified the branch, persisted in Party lessons, and improved organizational life, the awareness of Party members has been further enhanced, and their enthusiasm for work has increased.

    罗源县下放到乡的干部
    深入领导生产受到赞扬
    据福建日报消息　中共罗源县委会根据紧缩上层、充实基层的精神，从县区级机关抽调六十二名熟悉农村工作的干部下放到乡，担任乡级党政领导职务。几个月来，他们密切联系群众，参加生产领导生产，使全县农村出现了新气象。
    绝大部分人到达新的工作岗位后，与群众同甘共苦，积极工作，深受群众赞扬。原洋柄区委委员林玉官，到桂林乡后，便和农民一道挽起裤脚脱鞋下田生产，并耐心帮助农业社清理和公布了账目，以后社的账目都作得日清月结。社员们对这个新来的社长表示非常满意。原县委组织部副部长柳朝豪，到港头乡担任党支书。由于他整顿了支部，坚持了党课教育，健全了组织生活，党员觉悟进一步提高，工作劲头增大。
