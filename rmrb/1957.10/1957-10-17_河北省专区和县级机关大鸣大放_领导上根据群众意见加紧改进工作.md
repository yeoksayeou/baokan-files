Hebei Province Special District and County-Level Organizations Launch Large-Scale Airing of Views; Leaders Expedite Improvement Work Based on Mass Opinions

    (Our Newspaper's report) Currently, the rectification and airing of views in most of the special and county-level organizations, groups, and enterprises in Hebei Province has been enthusiastically launched. As of October 7, according to statistics from ten special districts, 385 units had launched the airing of views, accounting for 97.4% of the total number of units directly under the ten special districts. In special districts such as Handan, Xingtai, Shijiazhuang, Tianjin, Cangxian, and Baoding, the large-scale airing of views has formed a climax in most of the directly subordinate units. At the county level, 132 counties (cities) across the province have started airing views, while the remaining 25 counties are deploying and mobilizing.

    In the airing of views, various forms such as big-character posters, small group meetings, symposiums for different personnel, individual heart-to-heart talks, airing boxes, and rectification reception stations have been flexibly used to fully promote democracy and allow the vast number of cadres and workers to speak freely. According to statistics from 385 special directly subordinate units in ten special districts and 105 counties including Wuqiao, 424,432 criticisms and opinions of various kinds have been put forward (identical opinions are counted as one). From late September to October 7, within half a month, 351 directly subordinate units in eight special districts including Tangshan and 75 counties posted 116,442 big-character posters. Shijiazhuang Special District Hospital posted 250 big-character posters in one day and night. In some units, the walls in the courtyard were full, so they built additional reed walls or reed sheds. Some also set up "big-character poster writing agencies" to write for people who could not write. In the past six days, Hejian, Cangxian, and Wuqiao counties held 186 symposiums for different personnel, with a total of more than 21,300 criticisms and opinions.

    The opinions put forward by the vast number of cadres are very broad, ranging from leading personnel to general cadres, from office affairs to the state's principles and policies. Among the more than 5,700 opinions put forward by the directly subordinate units in Tangshan Special District, 16% directly criticize the party and government responsible persons of the unit and the special district, 32% belong to various aspects of business work, 17.8% relate to office affairs, 6.3% relate to cadre policies and ideological leadership, 5.3% relate to wages and welfare, 5.6% relate to party-masses relations, and 1.4% each relate to personnel relations and certain principles and policies of the state; the rest belong to other aspects.

    Leading cadres in various units mostly preside over various meetings in person, listen to criticisms and opinions, and read and take notes on big-character posters. Comrade Hao Sheng, Secretary of the Yutian County Party Committee, not only read the big-character posters of the County Party Committee, but also personally went to 27 county-level units to view the big-character posters.

    In the process of the large-scale airing of views, the vast majority of units resolutely implemented the spirit of rectifying and correcting simultaneously. Many units, with the person in charge as the main leader, organized "improvement groups" or "improvement committees" to classify and rank the opinions that were aired in a timely manner, study improvement plans, and solve problems that could be solved immediately. They also publicized the improvements to the masses through various meetings, big-character posters, or wired broadcasts; for some problems that could not be solved temporarily, they actively created conditions and explained them to the masses. According to understandings from 350 units in eight special districts including Baoding, Shijiazhuang, Xingtai, and Handan and 70 counties including Handan, 59,113 items have been improved (problems relating to the leadership's work style, where the relevant persons make self-criticisms, are not included). In the improvement, attention is generally paid to solving problems related to current production and the lives of the masses first. For example, the production stack of the Baoding Special District Supply and Marketing Cooperative re-examined and immediately adjusted the chemical fertilizers distributed to various counties, overcoming the phenomenon of out-of-stock in some places and backlog in others, and solved the difficulties of insufficient fertilizer for vegetable planting in Dingxian and Xushui and other places. According to everyone's opinions, Yutian County revised the road construction plan from Chengguan to Shiji窩, and it is estimated that it will be able to excavate 21,700 cubic meters less earthwork than the original plan, saving 7,250 man-days. In the improvement, various places also paid attention to leadership taking the lead and assigning special personnel to be responsible. The Qianxi County Party Committee promptly studied the more than 120 opinions put forward by various units and implemented rectification and correction simultaneously. A new atmosphere has emerged in the work of many units. The masses reflected, "We have never seen such concentrated criticism and improvement before," "This time, the leadership has really made up their minds."

    Currently, the development of the movement in some areas is not balanced enough, and some units are still slow to improve some major issues. The above problems are being addressed in various places, and it is expected that the rectification of all units at the special and county levels throughout the province will enter the stage of large-scale airing of views this month, and the airing of views in the vast majority of units will reach a climax.

　　河北省专区和县级机关大鸣大放
    领导上根据群众意见加紧改进工作
    本报讯　目前，河北省专、县两级绝大部分机关、团体和企业的整风鸣放已经热烈展开。截至10月7日，据十个专区统计，鸣放已经开展起来的有三百八十五个单位，占十个专区直属单位总数的97.4％。邯郸、邢台、石家庄、天津、沧县和保定等专区的多数直属单位，大鸣大放已经形成高潮。在县级，全省有一百三十二个县（市）开始了鸣放，其余二十五个县正在部署和动员。
    各地在鸣放中，灵活地运用了大字报、小组会、不同人员的座谈会、个别谈心、鸣放箱、整风接待站等各种形式，充分发扬民主，使广大干部职工畅所欲言。据十个专区的三百八十五个专直单位和吴桥等一百零五个县统计，已经提出各种批评和意见四十二万四千四百三十二条（相同的意见按一条计算）。唐山等八个专区的三百五十一个直属单位和七十五个县，从9月下旬到10月7日半个月内即贴出大字报十一万六千四百四十二张。石家庄专区医院，一昼夜即贴出二百五十张大字报。有些单位院子里的墙壁贴满了，就另搭席墙或席棚。有的还设立了“大字报代书处”，给不会写字的人代笔。河间、沧县、吴桥三县，最近六天内即召开了不同人员座谈会一百八十六次，共提批评和意见两万一千三百多条。
    广大干部提出的意见非常广泛，由领导人员到一般干部，由机关事务到国家的方针、政策。唐山专区直属各单位所提出的五千七百多条意见中，直接批评本单位和专区党、政负责人的占16％，属于业务工作各方面的占32％，机关事务方面的占17.8％，干部政策和思想领导方面的占6.3％，工资福利方面的占5.3％，党群关系方面的占5.6％，有关人事关系和国家的某些方针、政策的各占1.4％，另外是属于其他方面的。
    各单位的领导干部大都亲自主持各种会议，听取批评和意见，阅读和摘记大字报。玉田县委书记郝生同志，不但看县委机关的大字报，还亲自到二十七个县级单位观看大字报。
    在大鸣大放过程中，绝大多数单位坚决地贯彻了边整边改的精神。许多单位都以负责人为主，组织了“改进小组”或“改进委员会”，及时将鸣放出来的意见分类排队，研究改进方案，能立即解决的问题，立即解决，并将改进情况通过各种会议、大字报或有线广播向群众公布；有些问题暂时解决不了，就积极创造条件，并向群众说明。据保定、石家庄、邢台、邯郸等八个专区的三百五十个单位和邯郸等七十个县了解，现已改进了五万九千一百一十三条（属于领导作风方面的问题，由有关人作检查，不包括在内）。在改进当中，一般都注意了尽先解决有关当前生产和群众生活的问题。如保定专区供销社生产栈，将分配给各县的化学肥料，重新研究，马上调整，克服了此处脱销，彼处积压的现象，解决了定县、徐水等地种菜肥料不足的困难。玉田县根据大家意见，修订了由城关至石臼窝的修路计划，据计算将能较原计划少开土方两万一千七百立方公尺，可节省人工七千二百五十个。在改进中各地还注意了领导带头和责成专人负责。迁西县委对各单位所提出的一百二十多条意见，及时研究，贯彻了边整边改，不少单位的工作中出现了新的气象。群众反映说，“从来还没见到过这样集中的批评和改进”，“这一回领导上真发了狠”。
    当前有些地区运动的发展还不够平衡，有的单位对一些重大问题的改进上还迟迟不前。以上问题各地正在着手解决，预计在本月间全省专、县两级的所有单位的整风都将进入大鸣大放阶段，绝大部分单位的鸣放将达到高潮。
