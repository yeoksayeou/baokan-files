Artificial Earth Satellite

The Soviet Union launched the world's first artificial Earth satellite on October 4th. This world-shaking news marks the beginning of a new era in scientific development and signifies that mankind has taken the first step into outer space. This once again proves that the Soviet Union possesses the most advanced science and technology in the world.

The great Soviet scientist of rocket theory and interstellar flight, Tsiolkovsky, first proposed the principle of mankind conquering outer space in the last century. He published the design of an artificial satellite in 1895, proposing to use artificial satellites as a midway base for space travel to launch rockets to the moon and other planets.

In the following sixty years, many countries, including the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and Germany, further studied artificial satellites and made many kinds of artificial satellite structure and launch designs, as well as specific design work. Poland also began designing manned artificial satellites in September this year.

In preparation for the Third International Geophysical Year, both the Soviet Union and the United States decided to launch artificial satellites to cooperate with scientific research. Now the first Soviet artificial satellite is already operating in the sky, while the American artificial satellite, which is designed to be smaller and lighter than the Soviet one (the Soviet artificial satellite is 58 centimeters in diameter and weighs 83.6 kilograms, while the American one is expected to be about 50.8 centimeters in diameter and weighs 9.7 kilograms), is announced to be launched only next spring.

The launch of artificial satellites will help to accurately measure the size and shape of the Earth, determine the different densities of various regions on Earth, study the distribution and changes of geomagnetism, continuously measure high-altitude meteorological conditions over a large area for a long time, determine the atmospheric density at high altitudes, study the ionosphere which is important for radio communication, study various cosmic rays at high altitudes, collect data on meteors and cosmic dust, and further empirically verify Einstein's "general theory of relativity" and the theory that time will be relatively shortened, etc.

More importantly, these studies can not only increase our understanding of the Earth and more confidently grasp weather changes, but also collect various data necessary for future interstellar travel, paving the way for mankind to enter outer space.

It is generally believed that artificial satellites will be launched using multi-stage rockets. The first-stage rocket sends the artificial satellite to a height of tens of kilometers above the ground, and after the fuel is used up, it falls off. The second-stage fuel begins to burn, and after sending the artificial satellite further to an altitude of two to three hundred kilometers, it also falls off. The upper-stage rocket continues to rise by inertia, and when it rises to the highest point, the solid fuel in the last-stage rocket suddenly explodes, pushing the artificial satellite out, making it reach the first cosmic velocity of 8,000 meters per second. In this way, the centrifugal force it generates is enough to balance the Earth's gravity, and it can rotate around the Earth like the moon. The orbit of an artificial satellite is elliptical. Since there is still extremely thin air at high altitudes, the artificial satellite will reduce its speed around the Earth due to air resistance and gradually enter the denser atmosphere. Finally, it burns up like a meteorite. It is estimated that if the closest distance of the artificial satellite's orbit from the ground is 500 kilometers, it can exist for about a year, and if it is 300 kilometers, it can only exist for 15 days.

The artificial satellite launched by the Soviet Union can be seen with ordinary telescopes every day at dawn and dusk, and the signals sent by the transmitter on the artificial satellite can also be received by amateur radio operators. Since the Earth is an ellipsoid and the distribution of mass inside the Earth is not uniform, as well as the influence of atmospheric resistance, the orbit of the artificial satellite is not strictly elliptical, and there will be many irregular perturbations. These perturbations are very important data. Therefore, the Soviet Union has not only established many artificial satellite observation stations with the latest equipment, but also organized a large number of amateur radio enthusiasts and the general public to conduct observations in order to collect as much data as possible on the operation of artificial satellites.

After the first batch of artificial satellites is launched, manned artificial satellites, manned space stations, and finally interstellar spacecraft will follow. Soviet scientists have demonstrated the possibility of turning artificial Earth satellites into satellites of the moon and proposed plans to fly to the moon, Venus, and Mars. These plans can be realized when mankind masters the second cosmic velocity—11.2 kilometers per second. Many scientists believe that the first space station can be built within the next ten years, and unmanned rockets to the moon can be achieved roughly between 1960 and 1965, and flights to Venus and Mars are expected to be achieved between 1962 and 1967. When mankind masters the third cosmic velocity—16.5 kilometers per second—artificial celestial bodies will be able to leave the solar system and fly to other star systems.

    人造地球卫星
    苏联在10月4日发射出了全世界第一个人造地球卫星。这个震动世界的消息标志着科学发展的又一新纪元的开始，标志着人类已经迈出了进入宇宙空间的第一步。这再一次证明苏联拥有世界上最先进的科学技术。
    苏联火箭理论和星际飞行方面的伟大科学家齐奥尔科夫斯基早在上一世纪就第一次提出了人类征服宇宙空间的原理。他在1895年发表了人造卫星的图样，提出以人造卫星为宇宙航行的中途基地向月球和其他星球发射火箭的主张。
    以后的六十年间，苏联、美国、英国、德国等许多国家对人造卫星作了进一步研究，并且作出了许多种人造卫星结构及其发射的设想以及具体设计工作。波兰也在今年9月开始设计载人的人造卫星。
    在筹备第三届国际地球物理年的时候，苏联和美国都决定发射人造卫星，以配合科学研究。现在苏联第一颗人造卫星已经在天空运行了，而美国设计的比苏联的小而且轻得多的人造卫星（苏联的人造卫星直径为五十八公分，重八三点六公斤，美国的预计直径约五十点八公分，重九点七公斤），据宣布还要等到明年春天才能发射出去。
    人造卫星的发射有助于精密地测量地球的大小和形状，测定地球上各地区的不同密度，研究地磁的分布和变化，在广大面积上长时间连续测量高空气象情况，测定高空的大气密度，研究对无线电通讯有重要意义的电离层，在高空中研究各种宇宙射线，收集关于流星，宇宙尘的资料，对爱因斯坦的“广义相对论”、时间会相对缩减的理论加以进一步实证等等。
    更重要的是，这些研究不仅可以增加我们对地球的了解，更有把握地掌握天气变化，而且可以收集未来星际航行所必要的各种资料，为人类跨入宇宙空间开辟道路。
    一般认为，人造卫星将采用多级火箭来发射。第一段火箭把人造卫星送到离地面数十公里高处，燃料用完，即脱落下来。第二段的燃料开始燃烧，在把人造卫星进一步送到二、三百公里高空后，也随即脱落下来。上段火箭依靠惯性继续上升，到上升到最高点时，最后一段火箭里的固体燃料突然爆炸，把人造卫星推出来，使它达到每秒钟八千公尺的第一宇宙速度，这样，它所产生的离心力就足以同地球的引力相平衡，可以像月亮一样绕地球旋转。人造卫星的运行轨道是椭圆形的。由于大气高空仍然有极稀薄的空气，人造卫星将因空气阻力而降低绕地球运行的速度，而逐渐进入愈来愈密的大气层里。最后像陨石那样烧掉。据估计，人造卫星运行轨道离地面最近距离如为五百公里，就可以存在一年左右，如果是三百公里，只能存在十五天。
    苏联发射的这个人造卫星在每天黎明和黄昏的时候，可以用普通望远镜看到，人造卫星上发报机发出的讯号，业余无线电工作者也可以收到。由于地球是一个椭圆球体，地球内部质量的分布也不均匀以及大气层阻力的影响，人造卫星的轨道并非严格的椭圆形的，会有许多不规则的摄动。这些摄动是很重要的资料。因此苏联不仅建立了许多拥有最新设备的人造卫星观测站，而且还组织了大量业余无线电爱好者和一般群众进行观测，以便尽可能多地收集有关人造卫星运行的资料。
    在第一批人造卫星发出以后，将跟着出现载人的人造卫星，有人的星际站，最后是星际飞船。苏联的科学家们已经论证了把人造地球卫星变成月亮的卫星的可能性，提出了飞往月亮、金星、火星的方案。当人类掌握了第二宇宙速度——每秒十一点二公里的时候，这些方案就可以实现。许多科学家认为，在最近十年内就可以建成第一座星际站，而不载人的火箭飞往月亮大致可在1960年到1965年实现，飞往金星和火星可望于1962年到1967年实现。当人类掌握了第三宇宙速度——每秒十六点五公里的时候，人造星体就能离开太阳系飞往别的恒星系去了。　　　（新华社）（附图片）
