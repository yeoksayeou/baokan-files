Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 21st. Feng Qiuping, a famous wool knitter in Shanghai, today sent a set of beautiful woolen clothes to Suyete, a five-year-old Soviet girl who recognized her as a teacher. The girl lives in the Soviet city of Scherbanov. The upper part of the woolen clothes knitted by Feng Qiuping is a walnut-style sweater, knitted with pink wool; the lower part is a light blue suspender skirt with white polka dots.

In April of this year, Feng Qiuping suddenly received a letter from Scherbanov, a city in the Soviet Union. The letter was written by Suyete's mother. It turned out that Suyete saw the introduction of Feng Qiuping's wool knitting method in the People's Pictorial in January of this year. She liked it very much and asked her mother to write to Feng Qiuping, saying that when she grows up, she wants to learn the exquisite knitting techniques from "Mama Feng." After receiving the letter, Feng Qiuping immediately wrote back to express her willingness and prepared a gift for her. After more than a month of careful design, Feng Qiuping knitted this set of beautiful woolen clothes with Chinese flavor. She told reporters: "I hope Suyete can receive this little gift soon and dress herself up during the October Revolution festival."

Since the People's Pictorial introduced Feng Qiuping's innovative knitting method, it has aroused the interest of many Soviet women. From March of this year to now, more than 30 Soviet friends have written to her, asking her to introduce the knitting method. Feng Qiuping has enthusiastically replied to them, and sent them some embroidery samples and books on wool knitting methods.

    上海著名绒线编织师冯秋萍
    编织美丽绒线衣寄赠苏联女孩
    新华社上海21日电　上海著名的绒线编织师冯秋萍，今天把一套美丽的绒线衣，寄给曾认她作老师的一个五岁的苏联女孩斯悦特。这个女孩住在苏联社尔巴诺夫城。冯秋萍编织的绒线衣的上身是胡桃花式的套衫，用粉红色绒线编结；下身是淡蓝色镶白点的金铃花背带裙。
    冯秋萍在今年4月份忽然接到了苏联社尔巴诺夫城寄来的一封信，写信的是斯悦特的母亲，原来斯悦特看到了人民画报今年1月号介绍冯秋萍的绒线编结法后，非常喜爱，请求她母亲写信给冯秋萍，说等她长大以后要向冯妈妈学习精巧的编结技术。冯秋萍接到信后立即回信表示愿意，并为她筹备礼物。经过一个多月的精心设计，冯秋萍编出了这套具有中国风味的美丽的绒线衣。她告诉记者说：“这件小礼物希望斯悦特能很快收到，在十月革命节日里打扮自己。”
    自从人民画报介绍了冯秋萍创造的新颖的编结方法后，引起了许多苏联妇女的兴趣。今年3月到现在，已经有三十多位苏联朋友来信，要求她介绍编结方法，冯秋萍都热诚地回信答复，并送给她们一些刺绣样品和绒线编结法的书。
