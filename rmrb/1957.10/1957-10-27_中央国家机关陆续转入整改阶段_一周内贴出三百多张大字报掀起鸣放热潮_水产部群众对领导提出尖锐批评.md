Xinhua News Agency, October 24th: Since the Ministry of Aquatic Products entered the third phase of the rectification campaign, a vigorous blooming and contending tide, mainly in the form of big-character posters, has emerged. In the course of blooming and contending, the masses have raised many sharp criticisms.

Since the mobilization meeting on the 15th, the ministry has posted more than 340 big-character posters within a week. These posters criticized bureaucracy, subjectivism, and sectarianism among the leadership from various aspects. The content is very broad, including 100 posters related to principles and policies, systems, institutional setup, and personnel allocation; 81 posters related to aquatic product business; 63 posters related to leadership style and personal lifestyle; and many others related to personnel arrangements, cadre transfer and use, promotion, administrative management, welfare, and political and professional study.

In the big-character posters, many people criticized the ministry for its bloated organization and overstaffing. They said that the Ministry of Aquatic Products is mainly focused on developing mass fisheries. However, among the hundreds of staff members, the actual number of people in the Marine Fisheries Department, Freshwater Fisheries Department, and Fisheries Administration Department, which are primarily responsible for developing mass fisheries, is only 62. The number of people in other departments responsible for managing enterprises and administrative affairs accounts for the majority. For example, the General Office has more than 70 people. In response to these situations, the masses posted big-character posters proposing specific plans to streamline the organization and reduce redundant personnel. Some big-character posters criticized the bureaucracy and subjectivism of the leadership with specific examples. The leaders of the Enterprise Bureau, without prior planning, blindly purchased 50 large oil tanks worth 650,000 yuan in order to rush to spend money at the end of the year. These oil tanks are still left on the beach in Qingdao, exposed to the wind and rain. A big-character poster titled "The Quiet Laboratory" wrote: "The laboratory set up by the leadership with more than 1,000 yuan has resulted in a situation of having equipment but no tasks due to unclear guidelines and tasks, making the staff idle and very depressed."

Some big-character posters sharply criticized some leading cadres of the ministry, departments, and bureaus by name. For example, they criticized the minister for only paying attention to pondering and studying trivial issues in his work, without enough research on principles and policies, and without understanding the production situation of enterprises, resulting in "picking up sesame seeds and losing watermelons." Some leaders are busy all day long but do not know what they are doing. Some leading cadres have a very "bad temper," making it difficult for lower-level cadres to approach them. The big-character posters hope that leading cadres will resolutely correct their shortcomings after this rectification.

While posting big-character posters, some forums were also held in various departments, bureaus, divisions, and offices for blooming and contending.

The leading cadres of the Ministry of Aquatic Products attach great importance to the opinions of the masses. Some department heads posted big-character posters to sincerely express their acceptance and welcome to the opinions raised by the masses, and are prepared to conduct a deep self-criticism. They hope that everyone will expose more problems and offer more criticisms to help correct mistakes. The rectification leading group also designated special personnel to sort out the posted big-character posters by topic, print them, and distribute them to various departments and bureaus for study. Those that can be changed immediately will be changed. Issues that need to be debated will be further debated, so that everyone can speak freely and push the movement to a climax of rectification.

The upsurge of blooming and contending in the Ministry of Aquatic Products was launched after the broad masses, especially the middle masses, dispelled their ideological concerns. Before entering the third phase of the rectification campaign, their main concern was fear of retaliation. In response to these concerns, the rectification leading group repeatedly explained the essential differences between the third and second phases of the rectification campaign in terms of nature and content through group meetings, individual conversations, and other methods, especially using specific examples from the Ministry of Aquatic Products to illustrate the boundary between rightist remarks and correct criticisms, which dispelled the concerns of the masses and effectively promoted the in-depth development of the rectification movement.

    中央国家机关陆续转入整改阶段
    一周内贴出三百多张大字报掀起鸣放热潮
    水产部群众对领导提出尖锐批评
    新华社24日讯　水产部转入整风第三阶段以后，形成了以大字报为主要形式的大鸣大放热潮。在鸣放中群众提出了很多尖锐的批评意见。
    这个部从15日召开动员大会以后，在一个星期内，全部已经贴出了三百四十多张大字报。这些大字报从各方面批评了领导上存在的官僚主义、主观主义和宗派主义，内容非常广泛，其中有关方针政策、体制、机构设置、人员编制方面的一百张，有关水产业务的八十一张，有关领导作风和个人生活作风的六十三张，其他属于人事安排、干部的调配使用、提拔，行政管理，生活福利，政治和业务学习等方面的也很多。
    在大字报中，有许多人批评了这个部机构庞大、人浮于事的现象。他们说，水产部是以发展群众渔业为主的，但是全部几百人的编制中，真正以发展群众渔业为主的海洋渔业司、淡水渔业司和渔政司的实际人数只有六十二人，而其他属于管理企业和行政事务方面的司局人数占了大多数，如办公厅就有七十多人。针对这些情况，群众贴大字报提出了紧缩机构裁减冗员的具体方案。还有的大字报以具体的事例批评了领导上的官僚主义和主观主义。企业局领导上事先无计划，为了年终突击花钱，盲目地购置了价值六十五万元的五十个大油罐。这些油罐现在还放在青岛海滩上没有安置，任随风吹雨淋。有一张大字报以“静静的化验室”为题写道：“领导上用一千多元设置的化验室，由于方针任务不明确，结果产生了有设备无任务的现象，使得工作人员无事可做，十分苦闷。”
    有些大字报指名指姓的尖锐地批评了部、司、局一些领导干部。例如，批评部长在工作中只注意推敲、研究枝节问题，对方针政策研究不够，不了解企业生产情况，结果“拣了芝麻丢了西瓜”。有的领导人忙碌终日，不知所干何事。有的领导干部“脾气”很大，使下级干部很难接近。大字报希望领导干部经过这次整风痛下决心改正缺点。
    与张贴大字报的同时，各司、局、处、科室还召开了一些座谈会进行鸣放。
    水产部的领导干部对群众的意见很重视，有些司长贴出大字报向群众诚恳地表示接受和欢迎他们提的意见，并准备进行深刻检查。他们希望大家揭发更多的问题，提出更多的批评，以帮助改正错误。整风领导小组还指定专人将贴出的大字报陆续按问题分类整理出来，印发给各司、局研究，凡是有条件改的马上就改，须要争辩的问题，进一步展开争辩，使大家畅所欲言，把运动推向整改的高潮。
    水产部鸣放的热潮是在广大群众特别是中间群众解除了思想顾虑以后开展起来的。在转入整风第三阶段以前，他们主要的顾虑是怕打击报复。整风领导小组针对这些顾虑，通过小组会、个别交谈等方式反复地说明整风第三阶段和第二阶段在性质和内容上有着本质的不同，特别是以水产部的具体事例说明右派言论和正确批评的界限，解除了群众的顾虑，这就有力地推动了整风运动的深入发展。
