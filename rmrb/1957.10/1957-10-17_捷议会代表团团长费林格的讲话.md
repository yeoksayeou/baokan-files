Respected Chairman Liu Shaoqi of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, respected comrades and friends!

The Czechoslovak Parliament Delegation feels very honored to be able to participate in the enlarged meeting of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of China together with the delegation of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. Our joint participation in this meeting best demonstrates the unity of the socialist camp and the brotherly relations that exist among all countries in the socialist camp, be they large or small.

Our delegation's visit to People's China at the invitation of the National People's Congress of China is in return for the visit of the delegation of the National People's Congress of China to the Czechoslovak Republic at the end of last year. Here, it should be recalled that it was the resolution of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union that promoted parliamentary exchanges between all countries, supporting the great idea of peaceful coexistence and cooperation regardless of the social system of each country.

After a long and arduous struggle, the Chinese people overthrew the shackles of colonial exploitation, crushed all the conspiracies of internal enemies and capitalist lackeys, drove away the invaders, and joined us on the victorious road of socialism. When the delegation of the National People's Congress of China visited our country last year, they had the opportunity to understand the love and admiration of our people for the Chinese people. Chinese friends also learned about the achievements and problems of our construction endeavors.

The simple hospitality we extended to the Chinese delegation has now been repaid several times over by our Chinese comrades.

Our hosts also gave us the widest possible opportunities to understand the issues in the modern life of People's China. First, these were our talks with the leading comrades of People's China—Comrade Mao Zedong, Comrade Liu Shaoqi, and Comrade Zhou Enlai—who enabled us to better understand the basic political and economic issues in the current development of People's China. During our delegation's visits to various parts of China, to many important places in various provinces, to new factories, agricultural production cooperatives, cultural and social welfare institutions, and in direct contact with the working people of China, we gained a more concrete understanding of these issues.

Wherever our delegation went, we were greeted with brotherly warmth, and what we saw was far more than we had hoped to see.

Only a few days after arriving in China, we had already seen the vigorous development of the capital, Beijing. When we participated in the National Day celebrations, we saw more fully the high prestige and ardent love that the Chinese Communist Party, the People's Government, and the top leaders of China enjoy among the broadest masses of the people.

During our visit, we saw the tremendous efforts made by People's China in building its heavy industry and machine manufacturing. It exceeded our expectations to see these industries not only greatly developed, but also applying the most modern production methods in even the most backward areas of the past.

Although People's China emphasizes the rapid development of heavy industry, machine manufacturing, and the utilization of China's vast natural resources, it also pays special attention to the development of agricultural production. In this regard, the Leninist principle of a close alliance between industrial workers and working peasants has been brilliantly applied. The countryside is moving towards a new and better socialist life. We visited several cooperatives during our visit and saw that agricultural production cooperatives are systematically and rapidly increasing agricultural production using modern science and technology, thus ensuring an improved food supply for the rapidly growing population.

While developing industrial and agricultural production, People's China is also undertaking large-scale transportation construction. The completion of the railway linking Beijing and Ulaanbaatar has shortened the distance between China and Europe; the completion of the first Yangtze River Bridge is a great achievement in construction technology; and the construction of many railways in western China linking various economic centers has directly linked the south and the north. The long-standing aspirations of the Chinese people, which no previous Chinese government could realize, have been realized today. The entire geography of China has undergone major changes, facilitating the rational utilization of vast natural resources.

We visited Shanghai, a major port city with a population of seven million and the most important industrial and commercial center. We saw how the People's Government eliminated the undesirable legacy of colonialism and bureaucratic capitalism in just eight years.

In the past, in our country and other countries, the national question and its solution played a significant role. Therefore, we were interested in how the Chinese Party and government solved this problem. Especially at the Nationalities Institute in Kunming, we learned how Leninist principles are applied and how they are implemented by cultivating political and technical cadres from minority nationalities, promoting folk art and national traditions, and creating writing systems for these nationalities.

The new overall economic development and the great prospects that have unfolded before the working people of China have made possible a huge development in science, culture, and art. Our visits to various universities and colleges have convinced us of this. We were deeply moved when we saw how the new culture inherited the best traditions of the ancient people's culture.

Our delegation greatly appreciates the care and attention that People's China gives to the education of young people. Wherever we went, whether in factories, universities, or government offices, we encountered enthusiastic and energetic men and women who are completely faithful to the idea of building socialism and correctly understand the great efforts made by the Communist Party in this regard. Not only in Beijing, but also in the big cities of various provinces, new and beautiful universities and colleges are being built everywhere. Many new departments are cultivating young cadres for new tasks in socialist construction. The cultivation and care for these new cadres can indeed serve as an example for us.

We are pleased to see that now, in economic, cultural, and social life, Chinese women are holding jobs in many places. Only People's China can eradicate the deep-seated inequality between men and women that has existed since ancient times and grant women equal rights. Today, tens of millions of Chinese women are holding jobs that they were not entitled to hold in the past, and today they have gained the rights they deserve.

All that we have seen during our visit to China proves how important the eight years of the people being masters of their own affairs under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party have been for the development of China. It is these great achievements of the socialist economy that can most persuasively and best mobilize the broad masses to strive to complete the tasks set forth by the Party in the future. Today, the working people clearly recognize that the large-scale economic transformation and construction that China is now undertaking is not for the benefit of colonialists and large monopoly capital as it was in the past, but entirely for the benefit of the Chinese people. The source and driving force of China's new and smoothly developing planned economy are the hardworking and tenacious Chinese workers and peasants, who, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, form a solid class alliance that can create real miracles, and these miracles we have seen with our own eyes. We have also personally experienced the infinite wisdom of the Chinese people, who can quickly master new science and technology. The brilliant spiritual qualities of the Chinese people embody the ancient cultural traditions of thousands of years.

In the current rectification movement in China, the Chinese Communist Party is allowing all the working people to discuss the results of its work over the past eight years, the achievements it has made, and the prospects in the political, economic, and cultural fields. In the places where discussions have already begun, the Party has convincingly proved that the work of the People's Government is correct and successful. The very fact that the Party has launched this discussion is the best proof of the strength and power of the Chinese Communist Party. So far, in the course of the discussion, as we have seen with our own eyes, the vast majority of the people firmly stand on the side of the Communist Party and the People's Government. The measures that People's China can be proud of, including this rectification movement, best prove that People's China has true democracy. This rectification discussion is also a great contribution to the communist and workers' movement throughout the world. We Czechoslovakians must also learn as much as possible from this valuable contribution.

Our country has also made significant achievements in economic, social, and cultural construction during the period of people's democracy. Although our country was already a highly developed industrial country before the Second World War, industrial production has almost tripled compared to pre-war levels in the last twelve years. Our agriculture, especially in recent years, is also developing smoothly. The socialist component in agriculture already accounts for more than 50% of the national land, which is a great achievement under the conditions of our country. New social welfare measures, especially the health care system and the national insurance system, have further greatly improved the living standards of our working people. We have also encountered complex national issues in the past. I can say that we have successfully applied the principles of Marxism-Leninism. All nationalities and ethnic groups within our country are equal, and they can develop freely. We also solve problems with our neighbors in a spirit of mutual understanding. We have eliminated many past contradictions and established an atmosphere of mutual trust and brotherly cooperation between our country and other people's democratic countries. This relationship is only possible between countries where socialist ideology has completely triumphed. In our relations with the German Democratic Republic, we have eliminated all remnants of bourgeois nationalism in the spirit of pure proletarian internationalism.

Our cooperation with other countries in the socialist camp is constantly deepening, and we know that only because our country is a member of the socialist camp can our national survival and national independence be guaranteed; this is especially clear when we see that, with the help of Western monopoly capital, the danger of militarism and neo-fascism is growing again in the Federal Republic of Germany. Today, together with the German Democratic Republic, we are the westernmost outpost of the socialist camp. Here, I can declare on behalf of the entire Czechoslovak people that no force in the world can destroy our loyal alliance with the Soviet Union, People's China, and other countries in the socialist camp. We will always vigilantly and firmly guard the western outpost of socialism.

There is a solid and constantly deepening friendship between the Czechoslovak Republic, the Soviet Union, and People's China. Although our country is a relatively small country compared to these two countries, this friendship is built on the basis of equal relations. This fully proves that the principles of proletarian internationalism are applied in the mutual relations of socialist countries. This close cooperation is mutually beneficial to our country and other socialist countries. The selfless exchange of experience can make the science, technology, and production of these countries develop faster, and in this regard, the Soviet Union has given us the most help to all countries. We hope to further develop this mutually beneficial cooperation with People's China on a larger scale. We are deeply convinced that there are still great possibilities in this regard. There is a tremendous and invincible force in our cooperation, and we will fully utilize it to serve the lofty ideal of world peace.

Soon, we will jointly celebrate the 40th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution. We proudly declare that we are believers in the ideals of the October Revolution. The Great October Revolution is a new era in human history. Its realized ideals are an inexhaustible source of strength not only for today's socialist camp but also for all progressive forces in the world. The 20th Congress of the CPSU, based on a deep analysis of the development of the current situation, formulated a program for further victorious struggles for peace and socialism. In this way, the 20th Congress of the CPSU became the solemn prelude to our celebration of the October Revolution.

On the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution, we pay tribute to the Soviet people. Under the leadership of their Communist Party, based on the immortal ideas of the great Lenin, they achieved true miracles in the development of the national economy with their five-year plans. The Soviet people defeated the fascist forces of the entire world in the brutal struggle of the Second World War. Relying on the strength of its socialist planned economy, it admirably and quickly healed the heavy wounds of war.

The Czechoslovak people thank the glorious Soviet army for liberating them from fascist enslavement. Today, Soviet technology and advanced science have surpassed the most developed capitalist countries. The new culture of the Soviet Union, filled with the truly humanitarian spirit of Leninism, has become a source of strength that inspires all progressive humanity. The Czechoslovak people are pleased to see that the friendly alliance between the Soviet Union and People's China is constantly being consolidated and deepened, and are pleased to see that this exciting and inspiring consolidation and development of the Sino-Soviet friendly alliance ultimately shatters all the hopes and attempts of the enemies of socialism to weaken and disintegrate our great socialist camp from within.

Our interesting and instructive visit to People's China is coming to an end. This visit has convinced us that even though the conditions for building socialism in your country are different from ours in many ways, the basic experience of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in building socialism is universally applicable.

We are not only taking away many wonderful impressions from your country, but first and foremost, we have learned a lot. This visit has brought us tremendous encouragement for our future work.

On behalf of the entire Czechoslovak people, I bring you the faithful friendship of our people and the desire to further develop fruitful and sincere cooperation.

I wish the glorious Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, growing strength and success in realizing their great cause!

I wish the faithful friendship between the Chinese and Czechoslovak peoples further prosperity and development!

I wish the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union continuous growth and strength!

　　捷议会代表团团长费林格的讲话
    敬爱的全国人民代表大会常委会委员长刘少奇同志，敬爱的同志们和朋友们！
    捷克斯洛伐克议会代表团能与苏联最高苏维埃代表团一起参加中国全国人民代表大会常务委员会的扩大会议，我们感到十分荣幸。我们共同参加这次会议，这便最好地证明了社会主义阵营的团结，证明了在社会主义阵营各国中——不管是大国还是小国——都存在着兄弟般的关系。
    我们的代表团应中国全国人民代表大会的邀请到人民中国来访问，作为回拜中国全国人民代表大会代表团去年年底在捷克斯洛伐克共和国的访问。在这里应该记起，正是苏联最高苏维埃作出的决议提倡了一切国家的议会间的往来，支持了不分各国的社会制度而实行和平共存和合作的伟大思想。
    中国人民在长期的艰苦斗争之后，推翻了殖民剥削的枷锁，粉碎了一切内部敌人和资本主义的走狗们的阴谋，赶走了侵略者而与我们一起走上了胜利的社会主义的道路。中国全国人民代表大会代表团去年在我国访问时，有机会了解了我国人民对中国人民的热爱和钦佩。中国朋友们也了解了我国建设事业中取得的成就和问题。
    我们对中国代表团的简单的招待，现在中国同志们几倍丰盛地回报了我们。 
    招待我们的主人们也给了我们最广泛的机会来了解人民中国现代生活中的问题。首先，这就是人民中国领导同志们——毛泽东同志，刘少奇同志，周恩来同志——和我们的谈话，他们使我们更好地了解现在人民中国的发展中政治和经济的基本问题。在我们的代表团访问中国各地时，在各省许多重要的地方访问新的工厂、农业生产合作社、文化和社会福利机构时，以及在和中国的劳动人民的直接接触中，我们更具体地了解了这些问题。
    不管我们的代表团走到什么地方，到处都受到兄弟般的热烈欢迎，而我们所看到的东西比我们所希望看到的多得多。
    刚到中国几天，我们就已经看到首都北京的蓬勃发展。在参加国庆观礼时，我们更充分地看到中国共产党、人民政府和中国的最高领导同志们在最广大的人民群众中有着如何高的威信，受着如何热烈的爱戴。
    在访问过程中，我们看到人民中国在建设自己的重工业和机器制造业方面所作的巨大努力。这些工业不仅有了巨大发展，而且连过去最落后的地区中也应用了最现代化的生产方法，这出乎我们的意料之外。
    虽然人民中国强调迅速发展重工业、机器制造业和利用中国巨大的天然资源，但同时也对农业生产的发展加以特别的注意。在这方面光辉地运用了工业工人和劳动农民紧密联盟的列宁主义的原则。农村正在走向新的美好的社会主义生活。我们在访问中参观了几个合作社，我们看到农业生产合作社正在用现代的科学技术有系统地迅速地提高着农业生产，这样来保证改善人数迅速增长的人民的粮食供应。
    在发展工农业生产的同时，人民中国也进行着规模宏大的交通建设。建成了联结北京和乌兰巴托的铁路，缩短了中国和欧洲的距离；建成了第一座长江大桥这个建筑技术中的伟大工程；在中国西部也建成了联结各个经济中心的许多铁路，把南方和北方直接联结了起来。过去中国任何政府所不能实现的中国人民的多年的愿望，今天实现了。整个的中国地理起了重大的变化，便利了巨大的天然富源的合理利用。
    我们访问了上海，这个七百万人口的大港口，最重要的工商业中心。我们看到人民政府如何在短短八年中消除了殖民主义和官僚买办所遗留下的不良遗产。
    过去在我国以及其他国家中，民族问题及其解决曾起过巨大的作用。因此，我们对中国党和政府如何解决这个问题感到兴趣。特别是在昆明的民族学院中，我们了解到列宁主义的原则怎样被运用，怎样用培养少数民族的政治和技术干部，发扬民间艺术和民族传统，以及为这些民族创造文字等方法，来实现这个原则。
    新的经济的全面发展和在中国劳动人民面前所展开了的伟大前景，使科学、文化和艺术方面的巨大发展也成为可能。我们在各高等学校中的访问使我们对这一点深信不疑。当我们看到新的文化如何继承了古老的人民文化的最优秀的传统时，我们为之深为感动。
    我们代表团非常赞赏人民中国对青年教育所给予的关怀和注意。不管我们走到那里，无论是在工厂中、大学里或是机关里，我们到处都能遇到热情充沛的男女工作人员，他们完全忠实于建设社会主义的思想，正确了解共产党在这方面所作的巨大努力。不仅在北京，而且在各省的大城市中，到处都在建设着新的美丽的高等学校。许多新的院系正在为社会主义建设中新的任务而培养青年干部。对于这些新干部的培养和关怀，的确可以作为我们的典范。
    我们高兴地看到，现在，在经济、文化和社会生活中，中国妇女在许多地方担任着工作。也只有人民中国才能铲除自古以来男女间深刻的不平等，使妇女获得了平等权利。今天，千万个中国妇女担任着她们过去无权担任的工作，今天她们获得了应有的权利。
    我们在中国访问期间所看到的这一切，证明了在中国共产党领导下人民当家作主的八年，对于中国的发展具有如何巨大的意义。正是这些社会主义经济的伟大成就，能最具有说服力地、最好地动员广大群众为完成党所提出的今后的任务而努力。今天，劳动人民清楚地认识中国现在所进行的规模宏大的经济改造和建设并不是像从前一样为了殖民者和大垄断资本的利益，而完全是为了中国人民的利益。中国新的顺利发展着的计划经济的泉源和推动力是勤劳顽强的中国工人和农民，他们在中国共产党的领导下结成巩固的阶级联盟，就能创造真正的奇迹，而这些奇迹我们已亲眼看到了。我们也亲身体会了中国人民的无限的智慧，他们能很快地掌握新科学技术。在中国人民光辉的精神品质中体现了几千年古老的文化传统。
    现在在中国进行的整风运动中，中国共产党让全体劳动人民来讨论自己八年来工作的结果，已取得的成就和政治、经济与文化方面的前景。在业已展开讨论的地方，党令人信服地证明了人民政府的工作是正确的，成功的。党展开了这个讨论，这个事实本身便再好不过地证明了中国共产党是强大有力的。到现在为止，在讨论过程中，如我们亲身看到的一样，绝大多数的人民是坚决站在共产党和人民政府一边的。人民中国所可引以自豪的措施，包括这次整风运动在内，最好地证明了人民中国有着真正的民主。这个整风讨论也是对全世界共产主义和工人运动的伟大贡献。我们捷克斯洛伐克人也必须从这个宝贵的贡献中尽量吸取最多的教益。
    我国在人民民主的时期中，在经济、社会和文化建设方面也取得了重大的成就。虽然在第二次世界大战以前我国已是工业高度发达的国家，在最近的十二年中，工业生产几乎提高到战前的三倍。我国的农业，尤其是在最近几年中，也正在顺利地发展。农业中的社会主义成份已占全国土地的50％以上，这在我国的条件下是一个巨大的成就。新的社会福利措施，尤其是卫生、保健制度和国民保险制度进一步大大提高了我国劳动人民的生活水平。我们过去也碰到过复杂的民族问题。我可以说，我们成功地运用了马列主义的原则。我国境内的一切民族和种族是平等的，他们能自由地得到发展。对于我们的邻国，我们也以互相谅解的精神来解决问题。我们消除了许多过去的矛盾，在我国和其他人民民主国家之间建立了互相信任的气氛和兄弟般的合作关系。这种关系只有在社会主义思想完全胜利了的国家之间才可能存在。在与德意志民主共和国的关系中，我们根据纯粹的无产阶级国际主义的精神，消除了一切资产阶级民族主义的残余。
    我们和社会主义阵营各国的合作正在不断加深，我们知道，只有因为我国是社会主义阵营中的一个成员，我国的民族生存和国家独立才能得到保障；特别是当我们看到，在西方垄断资本的帮助之下，在德意志联邦共和国中军国主义和新法西斯主义的危险正在重新增长的时候，这一点就更为明确。今天，我们与德意志民主共和国一起，是社会主义阵营最西方的前哨。在这里，我可以代表捷克斯洛伐克全国人民宣称，世界上没有任何力量能够破坏我们和苏联、人民中国以及社会主义阵营其他国家之间的忠实的同盟。我们将永远警惕地坚定地守卫着社会主义的西方前哨。
    在捷克斯洛伐克共和国、苏联和人民中国之间存在着巩固的、并不断加深着的友谊。虽然我国同这两个国家比起来是一个比较小的国家，但这友谊是建筑在互相平等的关系的基础上的。这充分证明了在社会主义国家的相互关系中运用了无产阶级国际主义的原则。这种紧密的合作对我国和其他社会主义国家都是互相有利的。无私地交换经验可以使这些国家的科学、技术和生产更快地发展，而在这方面，特别是苏联给予我们各国的帮助最多。我们希望和人民中国也进一步在更大的范围内发展这种互利的合作。我们深信在这方面还存在着巨大的可能性。在我们的合作中蕴藏着巨大的不可战胜的力量，我们将充分地运用它来为崇高的世界和平的理想服务。
    不久，我们将共同庆祝伟大十月社会主义革命四十周年。我们骄傲地宣称，我们是十月革命理想的信徒。伟大十月革命是人类历史的新纪元。它业已实现了的理想不仅对于今天的社会主义阵营，而且对全世界的一切进步力量都是无限的力量的泉源。苏共二十次代表大会在深刻分析现今局势发展的基础上，制订了为和平与社会主义而进一步胜利斗争的纲领。这样，苏共二十次代表大会便成了我们正在准备着的十月革命节庆祝的庄严序曲。
    在伟大十月社会主义革命四十周年之际，我们向苏联人民致敬。他们在经济为战争所破坏的令人难以相信的困难条件下，胜利地打退了整个资本主义世界的干涉，消灭了得到外部一切帮助的国内阶级敌人。
    苏联人民在自己的共产党的领导下，根据着不朽的伟大列宁的思想，以自己的五年计划实现了国家经济发展中的真正的奇迹。苏联人民在第二次世界大战的残酷斗争中战胜了全世界的法西斯力量。他依靠着本国社会主义计划经济的力量，令人敬佩地迅速地医治了战争的沉重创伤。
    捷克斯洛伐克人民感谢光荣的苏军把他们从法西斯的奴役中解放出来。今天苏联的技术和先进科学业已超过了最发达的资本主义国家。苏联的新的充满了列宁主义的真正人道主义精神的文化，成了鼓舞整个进步人类的力量的泉源。捷克斯洛伐克人民高兴地看到，苏联和人民中国之间的友好同盟正在不断巩固和加深，高兴地看到，中苏友好同盟的这种令人兴奋鼓舞的巩固和发展，最终地粉碎了社会主义的敌人想从内部来削弱和瓦解我们的伟大社会主义阵营的一切希望和企图。
    我们在人民中国进行的有趣而且可以学习到许多东西的访问快要结束了。这次访问使我们深信，即使贵国建设社会主义的条件在许多方面和我国不同，但是苏联共产党建设社会主义的基本经验是普遍适用的。
    我们从贵国不仅带回去许多美好的印象，而首先是学习了许多东西。这次访问给我们今后工作中带来了巨大的鼓舞力量。
    我代表全体捷克斯洛伐克人民给你们带来了我国人民对你们的忠实的友谊和进一步开展卓有成效的真诚合作的愿望。
    祝以毛泽东同志为首的光荣的中国共产党和人民政府日益强大，顺利地实现自己的伟大事业！
    祝中国和捷克斯洛伐克人民间的忠实友谊进一步繁荣发展！
    祝以苏联为首的社会主义阵营不断增长强大！（附图片）
