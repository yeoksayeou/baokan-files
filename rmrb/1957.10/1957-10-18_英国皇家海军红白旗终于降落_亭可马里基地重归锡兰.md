Xinhua News Agency, Colombo, 16th: The British Royal Navy's red ensign was lowered for the last time in Trincomalee on the morning of October 15th, and the flag of Ceylon was raised in its place. British control of this naval base on the east coast of Ceylon, which lasted for one hundred and sixty-two years, has thus come to an end.

Britain formally handed over the Trincomalee base to Ceylon under an agreement reached between the two countries in June of this year.

More than 5,000 people attended the base handover ceremony. Ceylonese Prime Minister Bandaranaike said at the ceremony that receiving this base was implementing the Ceylonese government's foreign policy. Bandaranaike, after becoming Prime Minister in 1956, repeatedly pointed out that the presence of foreign military bases on Ceylonese territory was incompatible with Ceylon's policy of neutrality.

The Ceylonese government is considering making Trincomalee a free port. Although good roads and railways to other parts of Ceylon were built during the British occupation of more than a hundred years, there were neither local industries nor commercial buildings.

In half a month, Britain will also hand over the Katunayake Air Force Base, twenty miles from Colombo, to Ceylon.

Trincomalee is located on the east coast of Ceylon and is an important British naval base in the Indian Ocean. It is one hundred and forty-five miles from the Ceylonese capital of Colombo and has a population of approximately 30,000.

　　英国皇家海军红白旗终于降落
    亭可马里基地重归锡兰
    据新华社16日讯　科伦坡消息：英国皇家海军的红白旗10月15日上午在亭可马里最后一次降落下来，代之升起的是锡兰的旗帜，英国对锡兰东海岸的这个海军基地的一百六十二年的控制从此宣告结束。
    英国正式把亭可马里基地移交给锡兰是两国在今年6月达成的一项协议规定的。
    参加基地移交仪式的有五千多人。锡兰总理班达拉奈克在仪式上说：接收这个基地是实行锡兰政府的外交政策。班达拉奈克在1956年担任总理后曾经一再指出，外国在锡兰领土上保有军事基地是同锡兰的中立政策不相容的。
    锡兰政府正考虑使亭可马里成为一个自由港。这个港口在英国一百多年的占领期间虽然修建了通往锡兰其他地方的良好的公路和铁路，但却既没有地方工业也没有商业建筑。
    在半个月后，英还国将把离科伦坡二十英里的卡图那雅克空军基地移交给锡兰。
    亭可马里在锡兰东海岸，是英国在印度洋的重要海军根据地。它距锡兰首都科伦坡一百四十五英里，人口约三万人。
