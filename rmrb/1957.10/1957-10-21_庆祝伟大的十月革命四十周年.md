    Celebrating the Fortieth Anniversary of the Great October Revolution
    Chairman of the Jiusan Society, Xu Deheng
    The great October Socialist Revolution is now forty years old. We, along with the working people of the world, celebrate this glorious festival with infinite joy and gratitude, a festival that has opened the way for human happiness and a bright future. We extend our heartfelt and warm congratulations to the glorious and great Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet people.
    All revolutions of the past in history have transferred political power from the hands of one exploiting class to another, from one form of exploitation to another. Only the victory of the October Socialist Revolution has made state power belong not to the exploiters, but to the laborers, replacing the political rule of the bourgeoisie with the political rule of the proletariat, and declaring that the era of exploitation of man by man, all social oppression, and national oppression is gone forever, realizing the great ideals of socialism, peace, and equality and friendship among all nationalities.
    Over the past forty years, the cause of socialist revolution has developed unprecedentedly rapidly throughout the world, and socialist ideas have penetrated deeply into the hearts of the people. Along the bright road of the victory of the October Revolution, other socialist countries in Europe and Asia have become increasingly consolidated and strengthened. The socialist camp, headed by the Soviet Union, has grown into an invincible and powerful world system. Under the influence of the October Revolution, hundreds of millions of people in Asia and Africa have broken free from the shackles of colonialism, and the flames of national liberation struggles of colonial and semi-colonial peoples are burning ever more fiercely. All these unprecedented changes clearly prove that the great October Socialist Revolution, which marks a new era in human history, has illuminated the common path for the complete liberation of the proletariat in all countries, inspired the will and confidence of the working people and all oppressed nations of the world to struggle, and has played and will forever play an immeasurable, great, and far-reaching influence on the revolutionary cause of the people of the world and the entire course of world history.
    The people of the first socialist country, the Soviet Union, under the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, have victoriously completed five five-year plans and are now smoothly implementing the sixth five-year plan. The implementation of these plans has made the Soviet Union a powerful socialist industrial country and is moving towards communism.
    The great achievements of socialist construction in the Soviet Union fully demonstrate the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system. Over the past forty years, the speed of industrial development in the Soviet Union has been twelve to twenty times faster than that of the United States, Britain, and France. The total industrial output in 1957 exceeded the level of 1913 by thirty-two times, while the industrial production in the United States in 1957 increased only three times compared to the level of 1913. While industry has developed rapidly, Soviet agricultural production has also achieved brilliant successes. The Soviet Union has the largest and most mechanized agriculture in the world. The output and quality of many important agricultural products, such as wheat, cotton, sugar beets, and potatoes, rank first in the world. The milk production in the three republics of Latvia, etc., has greatly exceeded that of the United States per capita. On the basis of the rapid development of industry and agriculture, the Soviet Union's cultural, educational, and scientific undertakings have also made great progress and have taken a leading position in the world in many aspects. The Soviet Union has trained more than 3.5 million specialized personnel with higher education, and the scale and speed of training rank first in the world. The Soviet Union built the world's first nuclear power plant, successfully manufactured the largest synchrophasotron and various latest jet airliners for the first time, and the first nuclear icebreaker will be launched within the year. More than a month ago, it was the first to successfully launch the world's first intercontinental ballistic missile, and now it has successfully launched the first artificial satellite that has caused a worldwide sensation, thus creating a new era for science and opening up a bright and happy future for mankind. All these countless brilliant achievements of the great Soviet Union clearly show the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system. The decay of capitalism and the rising sun of socialism have made people clearly recognize the trend of history: the inevitable death of the old capitalist world and the decisive victory of the new socialist world.
    The Chinese revolution and the October Revolution are inextricably linked. Chairman Mao said: "The salvo of the October Revolution brought us Marxism-Leninism. The October Revolution helped the advanced people of the whole world, including those of China, to use the proletarian worldview as a tool for observing the destiny of the country and to reconsider their own problems. Taking the path of the Russians—this is the conclusion." The fundamental reason why our people were able to achieve victory in the democratic revolution and begin the great socialist revolution is that our people, under the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, combined the revolutionary theory of Marxism-Leninism with the specific practice of China and resolutely leaned to the side of the Soviet Union; we have continuously learned from the revolutionary and construction experiences of the Soviet Union and advanced along the path of the October Revolution, which is how we embarked on the broad road of socialism. In short, the victory of the Chinese people's revolution is the victory of the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism in China and the continuation of the victory of the October Socialist Revolution.
    Our country has already completed the task of socialist transformation ahead of schedule and overfulfilled the economic construction of the first five-year plan. Our country's national economy has been transformed from multiple components to a single socialist component, ending the system of class exploitation that has existed for thousands of years and establishing a socialist system. The face of our country has undergone fundamental changes. While celebrating the fortieth anniversary of the October Revolution, we are even more encouraged to see the victorious achievements of socialist construction in our country. In the industrial field, a total of 448 industrial construction units above the limit, with the 211 projects designed by the Soviet Union to help our country as the backbone, have been and will soon be completed, which will lay a preliminary foundation for our country's socialist industrialization and change the original incomplete state of our country's industry. In the agricultural field, grain output in 1957 increased by more than 70 billion jin and cotton output by 4 million dan compared with 1952, ensuring the needs of the people's livelihood and the smooth progress of national construction. In terms of water conservancy, a dozen large reservoirs and many medium and small water conservancy projects have been built, which not only defended against floods, but also benefited farmland water conservancy. In terms of transportation, nearly 5,000 kilometers of new railways and 12,000 kilometers of highways have been built in five years, both exceeding the original plan by about 20%. In particular, the early completion of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge is another inspiring event among countless miracles. In terms of cultural and educational construction, we have graduated more than 270,000 college students and more than 840,000 secondary specialized school graduates. The number of engineering and technical personnel in 1957 increased by 3.5 times compared with 1952. General large-scale enterprises can design their own, which has unprecedentedly strengthened the scientific and technical team and strengthened and improved the strength and level of science and technology. The phenomenon of unemployment has been basically eliminated, and the material and cultural life of the people has been universally improved. These brilliant victories are concrete evidence of the unparalleled superiority of socialism in our country and a practical embodiment of the infinite vitality of Marxism-Leninism in our country. We cheer for these achievements and believe that their development will inevitably have a profound impact on the cause of world peace and democracy.
    In a short period of five years, the reason why we have been able to achieve such brilliant achievements is due to the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China and the united efforts of the people of the whole country, and due to the generous and selfless assistance of the great Soviet Union. On the occasion of celebrating the fortieth anniversary of the October Revolution, we want to especially thank the great Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet people, who have defended and developed the achievements of the October Revolution and provided a strong guarantee for the victory of the socialist cause.
    In the current international situation, at a time when our domestic struggle against the rightists has achieved a major victory and socialist ideological education is being carried out throughout the country, commemorating the great festival of the October Revolution has even greater political significance. The leadership of the Party is the fundamental guarantee for building socialism. Without the Communist Party, there would be no new China, and without the Communist Party, there would be no socialism. Only by further strengthening the Party's leadership in all aspects and consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat can we better build socialism. Therefore, we must carry the struggle against the rightists to the end, thoroughly smash the various shameless words and deeds of the bourgeois rightists who are anti-Soviet, anti-Communist, anti-socialist, and anti-Marxist-Leninist, and under the leadership of the Party, resolutely win the complete victory of the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts, and fight to defend the path of the October Revolution.
    When commemorating the fortieth anniversary of the October Revolution, members of our Jiusan Society and the intellectual community must more clearly recognize that: "Intellectuals serve a certain economic base. Their relationship with the economic base is like the relationship between hair and skin. Now, the old capitalist economic base has died out. If the skin is gone, what will the hair adhere to? The only way out is to start a new life on the new socialist economic base, that is, to become one with the working people and wholeheartedly serve the great socialist cause." (People's Daily editorial, September 18) Therefore, we must earnestly accept socialist education, raise our ideological awareness, and be determined to overcome our two-sidedness of wavering between the capitalist and socialist positions in the resolute and thorough political struggle against the bourgeois rightists, because on the one hand, a person is willing to accept the leadership of the Party and take the socialist road, and on the other hand, he wants to maintain an infinite nostalgia for capitalism in the depths of his soul, so that socialism and capitalism "peacefully coexist" in one person's mind, which is absolutely impossible. Only by thoroughly carrying out self-reform in accordance with the six criteria instructed by Chairman Mao, fundamentally transforming our political stance, breaking the capitalist stance, establishing the socialist stance, closely integrating with the workers and peasants, subordinating individual interests and will to the unified interests and will of the broad masses of the people, and striving to become truly working-class intellectuals who serve socialism, can we be loyal to the socialist revolution under the leadership of the Party and make due contributions to the cause of national construction.
    In order to make our country's socialist construction advance rapidly and victoriously, we must also continue to earnestly study the Soviet Union in combination with China's actual situation. We must learn from the advanced experience and scientific and technological knowledge of the Soviet Union, and improve our country's science and culture to the international level as soon as possible. We must learn from the revolutionary spirit of hard struggle of the Soviet people, vigorously promote increasing production and practicing economy, and build the country with diligence and thrift. Holding high the banner of the October Revolution, we must accelerate the construction of our country into a great socialist country.
    The Soviet Union is a strong fortress for defending world peace. The socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union has become a powerful world system. Strengthening the unity of proletarian internationalism is our highest international obligation. We must maintain and strengthen the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and smash all the despicable conspiracies of the imperialists. The friendly cooperation between China and the Soviet Union is an important part of the great unity of socialist countries. This unity affects the victory of world peace and justice and affects the future of mankind. We must cherish the great friendship between our two countries as we cherish our eyes, and continue to consolidate and develop the unbreakable friendship and unity between China and the Soviet Union, oppose war, defend peace, and promote the development of the socialist cause, so that the light of the October Revolution will forever illuminate the road of victory for the working people of the world!
    Long live the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics!
    Long live the great Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet people!
    Long live the eternal and unbreakable great friendship between China and the Soviet Union!
    Long live the victory of Marxism-Leninism!

    庆祝伟大的十月革命四十周年
    九三学社主席  许德珩
    伟大的十月社会主义革命，于今四十周年了。我们和全世界劳动人民一起，以无限欢欣和感激的心情，来庆祝这个为人类幸福和光明未来开辟了道路的光辉节日，并向光荣伟大的苏联共产党和苏联人民致以衷心的热烈祝贺。
    所有历史上过去的革命，都是使政权从一个剥削阶级的手里转到另一个剥削阶级的手里，从这一种剥削形式转变为那一种剥削形式。唯有十月社会主义革命的胜利，才使国家政权不属于剥削者，而属于劳动者，用无产阶级的政治统治代替了资产阶级的政治统治，宣告了人对人的剥削、一切社会压迫和民族压迫的时代一去而不复返，实现了社会主义、和平、各民族平等友好的伟大理想。
    四十年来，社会主义革命事业在全世界有了空前的迅速发展，社会主义思想已经深入人心。沿着十月革命胜利的光明大道，欧亚两洲的其他社会主义国家日益巩固、壮大，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营已经成长为不可战胜的强大世界体系。在十月革命思想的影响下，亚非两洲的亿万人民，已挣脱了殖民主义的枷锁，殖民地和半殖民地人民的民族解放斗争的火焰，正在愈来愈大地燃烧着。这一切史无前例的变化，确切地证明了：标志着人类历史新纪元的伟大十月社会主义革命，照亮了各国无产阶级彻底解放的共同道路，鼓舞着全世界劳动人民和一切被压迫民族斗争的意志和信心，对全世界人民的革命事业和世界历史的整个进程，起了而且永远起着无可估量的伟大深远的影响。
    第一个社会主义国家的苏联人民，在苏联共产党的领导下，已经胜利地完成了五个五年计划，现在正顺利地执行着第六个五年计划，这些计划的执行，已使苏联成为一个强大的社会主义工业国，并正向共产主义迈进。
    苏联社会主义建设的伟大成就，充分显示了社会主义制度的无比优越性。四十年来，苏联工业的发展速度，就比美、英、法三国快十二倍到二十倍以上，1957年的工业总产量超过1913年的水平三十二倍，而美国1957年的工业生产较之1913年的水平只增加了三倍。在工业发展的同时，苏联的农业生产也获得了辉煌成就，苏联拥有世界上规模最大、机械化程度最高的农业，许多重要的农产品，如小麦、棉花、甜菜和马铃薯的产量和质量，都居世界首位，拉脱维亚等三个共和国的牛奶产量，按人口平均计算，已大大超过美国。在工农业迅速发展的基础上，苏联的文教科学事业也取得了长足进展，并在许多方面跃居世界领先地位。苏联已经培养了三百五十多万名受过高等教育的专门人才，培养的规模和速度为世界第一位。苏联建成了世界上第一个原子能发电站，首次成功地制造了最大的同步稳相加速器以及各种最新的喷气式客机，第一艘原子破冰船将在年内下水。一个多月前，最先成功地发射了世界上第一支洲际导弹火箭，现在又成功地发射了第一颗轰动世界的人造卫星，从而为科学创立了新纪元，为人类开辟了光辉幸福的远景。伟大的苏联这一切数不尽的光辉成就，再清楚不过地表明了社会主义制度无比的优越性。资本主义的腐朽，社会主义的旭日东升，已经使人们清楚地认识历史的趋势，是资本主义旧世界的必然死亡和社会主义新世界的决定胜利。
    中国革命和十月革命是密切不可分的。毛主席说：“十月革命一声炮响，给我们送来了马克思列宁主义。十月革命帮助了全世界的也帮助了中国的先进分子，用无产阶级的宇宙观作为观察国家命运的工具，重新考虑自己的问题。走俄国人的路——这就是结论。”我国人民所以能够取得民主革命的胜利，开始了伟大的社会主义革命，其根本原因就在于：我国人民是在中国共产党和毛主席的正确领导之下，把马克思列宁主义的革命理论与中国的具体实践相结合，坚决倒向苏联一边的结果；我们不断地学习苏联的革命经验和建设经验，沿着十月革命的道路前进，这才走上社会主义的康庄大道。总之，我国人民革命的胜利，是马克思列宁主义普遍真理在中国的胜利，是十月社会主义革命胜利的继续。
    我国已经提前完成了社会主义改造的任务，超额完成了第一个五年计划的经济建设，我国的国民经济已经由多种成分转变为单一的社会主义成分，结束了几千年来的阶级剥削制度，确立了社会主义制度，我们国家的面貌已经有了根本改观。在庆祝十月革命四十周年的同时，看到我国社会主义建设的胜利成就，更使我们欢欣鼓舞。工业方面，以苏联帮助我国设计的二百一十一项为骨干的限额以上的工业建设单位，已经和即将建成的共四百四十八个，这就为我国社会主义工业化奠定下初步基础，改变了我国工业原来残缺不全的状况。农业方面，1957年比1952年约增产了粮食七百多亿斤和棉花四百万担，保证了人民生活的需要和国家建设的顺利进行。水利方面，建成了十几座大型水库和许多中小型水利工程，不仅防御了洪水，而且广益于农田水利。交通运输方面，五年间新建铁路将近五千公里，公路一万二千公里，都超越原计划的20％左右，尤其是武汉长江大桥的提前完成，更是无数奇迹之中又一件振奋人心的大事。文教建设方面，我们高等学校毕业生已达二十七万多人，中等专业学校毕业生已达八十四万多人，1957年比1952年的工程技术人员增长了三点五倍，一般大型企业，都能自己设计，空前地加强了科学技术队伍，壮大和提高了科学技术的力量和水平。失业现象已经基本消灭，人民物质文化生活普遍得到了改善。这些辉煌的胜利业迹，是社会主义无比的优越性在我国的具体明证，是马克思列宁主义的无限生命力在我国的切实体现，我们欢呼这些成就，认为它的发展又将必然地对世界和平民主事业发生着深刻的影响。
    在短短的五年期间，我们所以能够取得这样光辉成就，是由于中国共产党的正确领导和全国人民团结一致的努力，是由于伟大苏联的慷慨无私的援助。在庆祝十月革命四十周年的今天，我们要特别感谢伟大的苏联共产党和苏联人民，正是他们捍卫和发展了十月革命的成果，为社会主义事业的胜利提供了坚强的保证。
    在当前的国际形势下，在我们国内反右派斗争已经取得重大胜利，社会主义思想教育正在全国展开的时候，纪念十月革命这一伟大节日，更具有重大的政治意义。党的领导是建设社会主义的根本保证，没有共产党就没有新中国，没有共产党就没有社会主义。只有进一步加强党在一切方面的领导，巩固无产阶级专政，才能更好地建设社会主义。因此，我们必须把反右派斗争进行到底，彻底粉碎资产阶级右派的反苏、反共、反社会主义、反马克思列宁主义的各种无耻言行，在党的领导之下，坚决取得政治战线上和思想战线上的社会主义革命的完全胜利，为保卫十月革命的道路而斗争。
    我们九三学社社员和知识界在纪念十月革命四十周年的时候，要更加明确认识到：“知识分子是为一定的经济基础服务的。他们同经济基础的关系，好比毛同皮的关系。现在，旧的资本主义的经济基础已经灭亡了，皮之不存，毛将焉附？唯一的出路，就是在新的社会主义的经济基础上开始新生活，就是同劳动人民打成一片，全心全意地为伟大的社会主义事业服务。”（9月18日人民日报社论）因此，我们必须在对资产阶级右派进行坚决彻底的政治斗争中，认真接受社会主义教育，提高思想觉悟，下定决心，克服自己在资本主义立场和社会主义立场中间动摇不定的两面性，因为一个人一方面愿意接受党的领导走社会主义道路，另一方面又要在灵魂深处保持着对资本主义的无限留恋，而使社会主义和资本主义在一个人的脑子里“和平共居”，这是绝对不可能的。只有按照毛主席指示的六条标准，彻底进行自我改造，从根本上改造政治立场，破资本主义立场，立社会主义立场，密切与工农群众相结合，把个人的利益和意志服从于广大人民的统一的利益和意志，争取成为真正为社会主义服务的工人阶级知识分子，才能在党的领导下效忠于社会主义革命，为国家建设事业作出应有的贡献。
    为使我国的社会主义建设迅速的胜利前进，我们还必须结合着中国的实际，继续认真地学习苏联。学习苏联的先进经验和科学技术知识，尽快地把我国科学文化提高到国际水平，学习苏联人民艰苦奋斗的革命精神，厉行增产节约，勤俭建国，高举着十月革命的旗帜，加速地把我国建设成为一个伟大的社会主义国家。
    苏联是保卫世界和平的坚强堡垒。以苏联为首的社会主义阵营已经成为强大的世界体系。加强无产阶级国际主义的团结是我们的最高国际义务，我们必须维护和加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结，粉碎帝国主义者的一切卑鄙阴谋。中苏两国的友好合作是社会主义国家伟大团结的一个重要部分，这种团结影响到世界和平与正义的胜利，影响到人类的将来，我们必须像保护眼珠一样的珍视我们两国之间的伟大友谊，继续不断地巩固和发展中苏两国牢不可破的友好团结，反对战争，保卫和平，促进社会主义事业的发展，使十月革命的光芒永远照耀着全世界劳动人民向着胜利的道路前进！
    苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟万岁！
    伟大的苏联共产党和苏联人民万岁！
    中苏两国永恒的、牢不可破的伟大友谊万岁！
    马克思列宁主义胜利万岁！
