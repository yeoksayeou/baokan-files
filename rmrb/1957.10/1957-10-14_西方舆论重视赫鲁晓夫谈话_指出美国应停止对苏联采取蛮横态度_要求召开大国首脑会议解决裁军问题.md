Xinhua News Agency, October 13th report from TASS, New York: American newspapers on October 12th commented extensively on Khrushchev's answers to "New York Times" reporter Reston's questions.

　　The "Washington Post and Times Herald" said that senior American officials are hurriedly analyzing Khrushchev's conversation with Reston. The newspaper pointed out that the main meaning of Khrushchev's entire conversation is that the United States should abandon its attempts to adopt a bullying attitude towards the Soviet Union.

　　The newspaper's editorial pointed out that a new war using the latest weapons would bring serious dangers to mankind. The newspaper indirectly indicated that "in the future," Soviet-American negotiations on the Near East issue "may be beneficial." The "New York Herald Tribune" said rather vaguely that the United States "should strive to promote contact between Soviet and American scientists, athletes, and official representatives through sincere means, so as to create an atmosphere of tolerance and harmony" as a first step towards achieving peaceful coexistence.

　　The general attitude of American newspapers is to support the State Department's statement on October 11th. This statement shows that American diplomacy still intends to implement the aggressive "Dulles-Eisenhower" doctrine in the future.

　　Xinhua News Agency, October 12th report from TASS: Khrushchev's answers to "New York Times" chief diplomatic reporter Reston have become a topic of heated commentary in Western countries' newspapers. London's "Star Evening News" wrote under the title "It's Time to Start Negotiations": "Despite the Soviet Union's mastery of intercontinental missiles, Khrushchev did not bargain from a position of absolute strength." It believes that in order to "break the deadlock," major powers should "show a spirit of wisdom" and begin negotiations.

　　Many British newspapers also demanded the convening of a summit conference of major powers to resolve disarmament issues.

　　Some French newspapers approve of the method mentioned by Khrushchev of guaranteeing peace through the conclusion of a disarmament agreement between the Soviet Union and the United States. For example, "Echo" expressed this attitude. The newspaper believes that only the conclusion of an agreement between the two major powers can stop a new war.

　　"Liberation" refutes advocates of military bloc policies. It reminded that since the balance of power on the international stage has become favorable to the Soviet Union, then the wisest solution is to recognize the facts and earnestly seek to resolve the issue of disarmament.

　　However, some Italian bourgeois newspapers with a "Cold War" attitude attempted to belittle the significance of Khrushchev's remarks, insisting that this was a "propaganda offensive."

　　Many progressive Italian newspapers, such as "Forward," "National Daily," "National Evening News," and "Unity," all emphasized that if the Soviet Union and the United States can reach an agreement on disarmament, especially on various new types of weapons, then the whole world may achieve new and greater achievements in progress and peace.

　　西方舆论重视赫鲁晓夫谈话
    指出美国应停止对苏联采取蛮横态度
    要求召开大国首脑会议解决裁军问题
    据新华社13日讯　据塔斯社纽约讯：美国报纸10月12日纷纷评论赫鲁晓夫答“纽约时报”记者赖斯顿问。
    “华盛顿邮报和时代先驱报”说，美国高级负责官员正在急忙地分析赫鲁晓夫同赖斯顿的谈话。报纸指出，赫鲁晓夫全部谈话的主要意思是，美国应当放弃对苏联采取蛮横态度的企图。
    这家报纸的编辑部文章指出，使用最新式武器的新战争将会给人类带来严重的危险。报纸拐弯抹角地表示，“将来”，苏美就近东问题举行谈判，“可能会有益的”。“纽约先驱论坛报”相当含糊地说，美国“应当竭力通过诚恳的办法来促进苏美科学家、运动员和官方代表的接触，这样就能创造容忍和和睦的气氛”，作为实现和平共处的第一步。
    美国报纸一般的态度是支持国务院10月11日声明。这个声明表明美国外交今后仍然打算实行侵略性的“杜勒斯—艾森豪威尔”主义。
    据新华社12日讯　据塔斯社讯：赫鲁晓夫答“纽约时报”首席外交记者赖斯顿问，成为西方国家报纸热烈评论的题目。伦敦“明星晚报”以“是开始谈判的时候了”为题写道：“尽管苏联掌握了洲际导弹，赫鲁晓夫并没有站在绝对优势的力量的立场上讨价还价”。它认为，为了“打破僵局”，各大国应该“表现出一种明智的精神”并开始谈判。
    英国许多报纸也要求召开大国首脑会议来解决裁军问题。
    法国某些报纸赞成赫鲁晓夫提到的通过苏美两国缔结裁军协定来保证和平的办法。例如，“回声报”就表示了这种态度。这家报纸认为，只有两个大国缔结协定才能制止新的战争。
    “解放报”驳斥军事集团政策拥护者。它提醒说，既然国际舞台的力量对比变得对苏联有利，那么，最明智的解决办法就是承认事实，认真地谋求解决裁军问题。
    但是，一些抱着“冷战”态度的意大利资产阶级报纸企图贬低赫鲁晓夫谈话的意义，硬说这是“宣传攻势”。
    意大利的许多进步报纸“前进报”、“国家报”、“国家晚报”、“团结报”都强调指出，如果苏联同美国能够就裁军问题特别是就各种新式武器达成协议，那么全世界在进步和和平方面就可能取得新的更大的成就。
