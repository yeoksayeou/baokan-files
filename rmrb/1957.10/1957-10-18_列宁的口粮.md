　　Lenin's Rations
　　P. Kolokolov
    As a messenger, I was responsible for managing the meals for the staff. Lenin's name was also on the general list of those who were provided meals. I never dreamed that Lenin, who worked tirelessly for years, would be eating the same inadequate rations as us lower-level cadres.
    My mother worked in the canteen of the People's Committee, and she told me this story:
    "Once, I glanced into the canteen, and who was standing at the counter? It was Lenin. He was happily biting into a piece of bread and the tail of a herring. He saw me and seemed very embarrassed. 'Please forgive me for helping myself,' he said: 'I was too hungry, so I came to eat a little.' I regretted why I barged in at that moment. I ran back to the kitchen and cried a lot... Just think, Lenin apologized to me—a cleaning woman—what for?"
    This story shocked me. The next time I made out the ration list, I tried to change the numbers with a pencil and eraser, so I could get an extra ration.
    The kitchen manager didn't notice at all, and I excitedly ran back to Lenin's office with double the bread, sugar, herring, and other things. I said to myself, this time, he can really eat his fill. Yes, I was a little worried, what if he guessed it? I cheered myself up: No way, he's so busy, how could he notice these little things? But when I put these things on his desk, I got scared, his usual cheerful smile disappeared, his eyes shot from me to the rations, waiting for my explanation.
    "Why am I getting more than others?" he finally questioned.
    I couldn't lie to him, so I told him everything as it was.
    "You shouldn't do this," Lenin said: "After all, you took other people's rations and gave them to me. Comrade Kolokolov, you must not do this again!"
    He then picked up the dinner knife, ate his portion of the rations, and ordered me to take the rest back to the kitchen.

### 列宁的口粮

　　列宁的口粮
　　普·科洛科夫
    作为一个传达员，我负责管理工作人员的伙食。在开伙的总名单里，也记上了列宁的名字。我做梦也不会想到，长年劳累的列宁，竟然和我们下级干部一样，吃着营养不足的口粮。
    我的母亲是在人民委员会食堂里工作的，她告诉了我这么一个故事：
    “有一回，我朝食堂里瞧了一眼，在那柜台前站着的是谁呀？原来是列宁。他正在津津有味咬着一块面包和一条鲱鱼的尾巴。他看见了我，好像非常尴尬。‘请原谅我自己动手吧，’他说：‘我太饿了，因此走来吃一点。’我悔恨那时候为什么要闯了进去。我跑回厨房来，大哭了一顿……想想吧，列宁向我——一个做杂工的妇人道歉，这是为了什么呢？”
    这个故事使我大吃一惊。在下一次开列口粮领单的时候，我就想法子用铅笔和橡皮更改了数字，这样去多领一份口粮。
    厨房的管理员一点也没留心，我就拿着双份的面包、糖、鲱鱼和别的东西兴冲冲地跑回列宁的办公室里来。我对自己说，这一回，他真的可以吃个饱了。是的，我还有一些担心，要是给他猜着了怎么办？我替自己打了气：不会的，他这样忙，那儿会注意到这些小事情来？可是，当我把这些东西放到他的桌子上的时候，我害怕起来了，他惯常迎接我的愉快的微笑消失了，他的眼光从我的身上射到口粮上去，等待我的解释。
    “为什么我拿的比别人多些？”他终于诘问了。
    我不能对他说谎，只好原原本本地告诉他。
    “你不应该这样做，”列宁说：“毕竟，你是拿了别人的口粮转给我的。科洛科夫同志，以后再不能这样做了！”
    他于是拿起了餐刀，吃他的那一份口粮，吩咐我把其余的一份拿回厨房里去。
