Baptized by the Great October
Wang Hongxun

The Finland Station Welcomes Lenin

On the banks of the Neva River in Petrograd, there was a large "Hardware Workers" factory. In 1917, I worked in the lathe workshop of this factory. At that time, although I had been in Russia for more than three years, I still could not speak Russian. Because I originally planned to do hard labor here for a few years, earn some money and return to China, I didn’t think it mattered whether I could speak Russian or not. Every time I talked to Russians, I had to ask Wen Ming, our Chinese workers' translator, to interpret.

At that time, the Russian factory owners did not provide us with housing, and we had nowhere to live. Once, we stumbled into a Russian barracks. The Russian soldiers were very nice to the Chinese workers, and they allowed us to sleep in the barracks. Some people even ate one or two slices of black bread that the Russian soldiers gave them. I also stayed in a small inn that cost five cents a night. It was a row of wooden beds, separated into small compartments with wooden boards, each compartment about two feet wide. Lying down, one would be squeezed and unable to move. Later, I finally met a kind shoemaker who allowed me to squeeze with him in a dilapidated wooden house.

There was no food to eat in Petrograd, so I had to frequently go to the countryside to beg for food from the farmers. The rich peasants were all bad seeds, hoarding a lot of grain at home, but not giving any to others. The poor peasants were really good to the Chinese, giving me whatever they could eat. After the meal, they would let me stay overnight. They swept the floor and put thick straw mats on it, and some Russian old ladies even put their coats on me. In this way, although I worked in the factory, I was still almost like a vagrant. Every day, besides working in the factory, I could only wander the streets.

In early April, on Easter, it was already after 11 o'clock at night. I left the dull and crowded wooden house, and strolling in the gentle spring breeze, I walked towards the vicinity of the factory. When I got close to the Finland Station, I saw brilliant lights, and the square in front of the station was crowded with thousands of people, constantly shouting: "Hurrah!" "Hurrah!" I tried to squeeze to the front, but I couldn't push through the wriggling crowd. There were workers, as well as naval and army soldiers, holding high red flags and banners, jumping, and constantly waving their hats, their emotions were so excited and exhilarated. I couldn't figure out what was going on, so I had to stand at the very back, looking over the heads of those swaying people. In the dazzling searchlights, it seemed like countless people saw their dearest person. The applause, laughter, and cheers all around mixed together, like the rumbling thunder of summer. I kept wondering, who is it! What exactly is going on with everyone gathering here? I wanted to ask my Russian friends beside me, but firstly, they were concentrating on looking ahead and didn't have time to pay attention to me; secondly, I didn't understand Russian, so I still wouldn't understand what they said.

After a while, the square slowly quieted down, and it seemed like someone was giving a speech in the distance. What were they saying? I couldn't hear clearly. Looking at the few people in front of me, they kept opening their mouths, probably also unable to hear. There were really tens of thousands of people! And I was standing at the very back, not even able to see the person's face clearly. The few Russian workers standing next to me were smiling and discussing, and after listening carefully for a while, I only heard them constantly saying: Lenin, Lenin. They were also gesturing towards the front. Who exactly was Lenin? I didn't know at that time. Only from the faces of these Russian workers, I could see that when they mentioned this name, they revealed unparalleled respect and love. At this time, I realized that the person being warmly welcomed by everyone was Lenin. Lenin, this was the first time I heard this resounding name!

Suddenly, another burst of cheers erupted in the front: "Hurrah!" "Long live the socialist revolution!" Probably the speech was over. People cheered, throwing their hats, and rushing forward. I couldn't help but move forward as well. By the time I reached the center of the square, Lenin had already left. People chatted and began to disperse, and I also left the Finland Station feeling lost.

That night, the great and moving scene at the station ignited new hope in my heart.

The Petrograd Chinese Workers' Patrol

Since Lenin returned to Petrograd, I felt a big change in the factory: the Russian factory owners dared not casually beat and scold our worker brothers anymore, nor did they delay our wages. People were also more active than before. The workers' emotions were excited and uplifted, and they were always busy with something. Sometimes, when the workers held meetings, Russian workers would come to find us, wanting us to attend the meetings together. I always went happily. But I couldn't understand Russian, so I didn't quite understand what was being discussed at the meetings. During May and June, organized strikes frequently broke out in the factory. Sometimes, when we were working in the workshop, an unfamiliar person would suddenly come in, stand on a stool and speak. The workers would immediately put down their work and surround him to listen. As soon as he finished speaking, that person would leave. The Russian workers would say to me: "Don't work anymore, we are going to demonstrate to Kerensky!" I believed them very much, put down my work, wiped my hands, and followed the workers' ranks to rush into the street.

There were so many worker brothers on the street! From every factory. Red flags fluttered in the ranks, and banners were held high. They marched through the streets in a mighty manner and gathered in a large square. Many naval and army soldiers also came, and the workers applauded warmly, embraced them, and stood closely together. The sound of "Hurrah" shook all of Petrograd. In the square, someone stood on a makeshift platform and gave a speech. The words of the Bolshevik propagandists touched the hearts of us workers, made us see the light, and increased our infinite strength. After several more months like this, the great October Revolution finally broke out.

In the summer of 1920, the Chinese Branch of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) was established in Leningrad. There was a responsible comrade named Bolevannov. He could speak Chinese and often talked politics with us, teaching us to learn Russian. If I didn't go at the scheduled study time, he would come to find me in person. With the help of Bolevannov and the Chinese Branch, I began to understand some revolutionary principles, and my heart slowly became clear. I left my motherland, left my fellow villagers, and came to Russia to make a living, suffering from the oppression and exploitation of capitalists, and suffering from the bullying of Russian foremen. After the October Revolution, I, a Chinese worker without relatives or support, finally received warmth and friendship. At that time, I understood very little revolutionary theory, and was still just a communist sympathizer.

In March 1921, a counter-revolutionary rebellion broke out in Kronstadt, a naval port not far from Leningrad. The situation was very tense, and the revolution encountered serious difficulties. The counter-revolutionaries shouted wildly: We only want Soviets, not Bolsheviks! At this time, Bolevannov found me and said: "Our armed forces have all been dispatched to suppress the counter-revolutionary rebellion in Kronstadt. Leningrad is in danger, and the White Guards and the bourgeoisie may riot at any time,妄想 trying to overthrow our regime. We workers should arm ourselves to defend our own regime."

I said: "I will do my best to do whatever work the Bolsheviks give me."

Bolevannov was very satisfied with my answer and immediately wrote me a note. According to his instructions, I came to No. 41 Nevsky Prospekt – the First District Party Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks). There were so many people here! The building was full of people, all waiting to be assigned tasks. I squeezed into the crowd and with great effort, I walked into the office and told the comrades of the District Party Committee the instructions that Bolevannov gave me. They immediately found a Chinese worker and introduced him to me, saying: "This is your captain, Comrade Zhu Wanfu, you listen to his command."

Late at night, the surroundings were quiet. The wind from the Neva River made people feel cool. Our Chinese worker patrol team of more than twenty people, carrying rifles and lined up in neat rows, patrolled and guarded the streets and alleys. The comrades of the District Committee made it very clear to us that we must always be vigilant, ready to suppress the White Guard rebellion in Petrograd at any time, and defend the motherland of the working class.

After a few days, the counter-revolutionary rebellion in Kronstadt was suppressed, and the patrol team was disbanded.

Moscow University of the Toilers of the East

In the summer of 1921, the University of the Toilers of the East was founded in Moscow. Through the introduction of the Chinese Branch of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), I came to Moscow. The school's address was near Strastnaya Square (now Pushkin Square). When I first arrived, there were no school buildings yet, and the two of us Chinese slept on a stage in a club. We didn't move into the dormitory until the beginning of September. This was a five-story building, with glazed tiles covering the eaves. Looking out from the large glass windows, one could see the square and the statue of Pushkin. The principal was Proyd, who often told us about the customs of various ethnic groups, and sometimes took out the costumes of various ethnic groups to help us understand the hobbies and cultural characteristics of those ethnic groups. There were more than a thousand students in the whole school, including Chinese, Mongolian, Korean, and Japanese. The Chinese class had more than forty students. From 1921 to 1924, comrades such as Ren Bishi, Wang Ruofei, Zhao Shiyan, Xiao Jinguang, Xu Zhizhen, and Xiao San came to Moscow University of the Toilers of the East to study. At that time, I was basically illiterate, and only knew a few simple characters in Russian and Chinese. Comrades Ren Bishi and Wang Ruofei were very concerned about my studies and often taught me to recognize and write characters. There was a party organization in the Chinese class, and I later joined the party.

At that time, our life was very hard, but it was much better than some Soviet comrades. We all wore grass-green linen military uniforms, with belts and pointed hats. The Soviet leather boots were too big, and when we put them on, there was a large gap in front. After wearing them for a few days, the toes of the boots would curl up. Once, some of our classmates took a photo together. Everyone stood in a pile, and the toes of each boot were curled up very high, which looked very interesting.

In 1921, there was a famine in the Soviet Union, and each person could only receive one kilogram of black bread a day. Our classrooms were very simple, and the equipment was also very poor. The pencils we used were thick and hard, and they would break through the paper with a single poke. No one had a decent notebook. Each person was given a large sheet of paper, which they would cut up and staple into a notebook for their own use. The handouts were all mimeographed. In class, except for Russian class, the rest of the courses had to be translated for everyone by Li Zhongwu.

I remember that Comrade Qu Qiubai also gave us lectures at that time. He lectured on social science. Comrade Qiubai was then a Moscow correspondent for the "Morning Post." He had a job and was a reporter, so he was relatively well-off financially. He lived alone in a small room. Sometimes he would get some rice from somewhere, and when he saw us coming, he would say: "I just got some rice, let's cook it and eat together."

Although the days were a bit hard, everyone was in good spirits. We participated in voluntary Saturday labor on time. Once the school assigned a task, we more than a thousand students would line up, beat drums, blow bugles, and go to the construction site to dig pits and carry wooden boards. The students also organized an entertainment team. When we held evening parties during festivals, we would put up Chinese lanterns with ethnic characteristics according to our motherland's customs, which surprised foreign friends. When we performed plays, the Moscow Art School specially sent people to help us rehearse. Xiao San and I, as well as some other comrades, participated in the performances.

At the Moscow University of the Toilers of the East, we could often get news from China. Many party comrades who came from China would give us reports. In 1923, we discussed the domestic strike issue; in 1924, we held many consecutive meetings to enthusiastically discuss the issue of cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party.

When I was about to leave Moscow University of the Toilers of the East, I encountered the greatest misfortune I would never forget: On January 21, 1924, our proletariat's great leader and teacher, Comrade Lenin, passed away in Gorki village near Moscow. When the bad news came, many students cried. The school immediately held a memorial meeting, and Principal Proyd gave a sorrowful speech. The next morning, the whole school lined up to pay their respects in the Hall of Columns of the House of Trade Unions. There were many people that day, and everyone lined up in a long queue, waiting silently. We waited all morning, and only then did two people line up in a row and slowly walk into the hall. Comrade Lenin's coffin was placed on a high platform, and Comrades Voroshilov and Bukharin stood on both sides. I moved my feet lightly, and I couldn't help but shed tears. When I was about to reach the door, I tried my best to turn my head back to take one last look at Comrade Lenin's remains.

On Sunday, there was heavy fog and the weather was extremely cold. Early in the morning, our team began to gather on a street near Red Square. At this time, the streets and alleys were crowded with people, but it was very solemn and quiet. The entire city flew its flags at half-mast, hanging black gauze; all the working people, in the sound of salutes, bid farewell to Comrade Lenin, the great leader and teacher of the world's proletariat.

In June 1924, I graduated from Moscow University of the Toilers of the East. In the Soviet Union, I successively worked in party work, trade union movements, and agriculture, until a few months ago when I returned to my motherland from the Soviet Union. I am sixty-two years old this year. For more than thirty years, I have been able to faithfully work for the cause of communism, which is inseparable from Lenin's teachings and the education and cultivation of Moscow University of the Toilers of the East.

    伟大十月的洗礼
    王鸿勋
    芬兰车站迎列宁
    彼得格勒的?瓦河畔，有一座规模很大的“五金工人”工厂。1917年，我在这座工厂的旋工车间做工。那时，虽然我到俄国已经三年多，可是还不会说俄国话。因为我本来打算在这儿干几年苦工，挣点钱就回国的，所以认为会不会俄国话也没有什么关系。每次和俄国人谈话，都得找我们中国工人的通事——闻明来翻译。
    那时，俄国厂主不给我们房子，没有地方住。有次，我们瞎撞到俄国兵营去。俄国士兵对中国工人很好，他们留我们在兵营里睡觉。有几个人在那里还吃到俄国士兵分给他们的一两片黑面包。一夜五分钱的小旅店，我也住过。那是一排木板床，上面用木板隔成一格一格的，每个格子里约莫有二尺来宽的地方，躺上去就被夹住了，动弹不得。后来，好不容易遇到一位好心的靴匠，让我和他挤在一个破烂的木板屋里。
    在彼得格勒没有东西吃，我不得不经常往乡下跑，找农民讨点吃的。富农们都是坏种，家里存着许多粮食，却一点不给旁人。穷苦的农民们，对中国人真好，他们能吃到什么，就给我吃什么。吃完饭还留我过宿。他们打扫地板，在上面垫上很厚的草垫子，有些俄国老太太还把大衣给我盖上。这样，我虽然在工厂干活，却仍然和一个流浪者差不多。每天除了在厂里作工以外，就只好在街上游荡。
    4月初，复活节那天，已是夜间十一点多钟了，我离开沉闷而拥挤的木板房子，迎着和煦的春风，蹓跶着向工厂附近走去。快到芬兰车站的时候，只见灯光辉煌，车站前面的广场上，挤满了成千上万的人，他们不住地喊着：“乌拉！”“乌拉！”我想挤到跟前去，却怎么也拨不开蠕动的人群。这里有工人，也有海、陆军士兵，他们高举着红旗和标语牌，跳跃着，不停地挥舞着帽子，情绪是那样激动、兴奋。我摸不清是怎么回事情，只好站在最后边，从那些晃动着的人头上望去，在耀眼的探照灯中，好像无数的人看到了他们最亲爱的人。四周的掌声、笑声、欢呼声混成一片，有如夏天的??的滚雷。我心里直捉摸，这是谁呀！大家聚在这儿，到底是怎么回事？想问问身边的俄国朋友吧，一来人家正聚精会神地往前面看着，根本顾不上；二来我又不懂俄国话，人家说了我还是不明白。
    停了一会，广场上慢慢地安静下来，远处好像有人在发表演说。说些什么？我听不清楚，看看我前面的几个人，不住地张着嘴巴，大约也是听不见。真有成千上万的人呵！我又是站在最后边，连那人的面孔都看不清楚。在我旁边站着的几个俄国工人，正笑咪咪地议论着，我仔细听了一会儿，只听见他们不住地说：列宁，列宁。手还向前面比划着。列宁到底是什么人？我那时还不知道。只是从这些俄国工人的脸上，我看出来，当他们提到这个名字的时候，流露出无上的尊敬和爱戴的神情。这时，我才想到那位被大家热烈欢迎的人，就是列宁。列宁，我是第一次听到这个响亮的名字呵！
    忽然，前面又爆发了欢呼声：“乌拉！”“社会主义革命万岁！”大概是演讲结束了。人们欢呼着，抛着帽子，向前涌去。我也不禁地向前移动，等我到达广场中心的时候，列宁早已离开了那里。人们谈笑着，开始散去，我也惘然若失地离开了芬兰车站。
    这一夜，车站上的那种伟大动人的场面，到底使我的心头燃起了新的希望。
    彼得格勒中国工人巡逻队
    自从列宁回到彼得格勒以后，我感觉到工厂里起了大变化：俄国厂主不敢再随便打骂工人兄弟了，也不再拖欠我们的工资了。人们也比从前活跃了。工人们的情绪激昂振奋，总是忙着些什么事情，有时，工人们开会了，就有俄国工人来找我们，要我们一起去参加会议，我总是高兴地去了。可是我听不懂俄国话，会上谈了些什么，我也不大明白。5、6月间，工厂里经常爆发有组织的罢工。有时，我们正在车间里干活，忽然进来一个不认识的人，站在凳子上就讲话，工人们立刻放下工作，围在他跟前听。一讲完话，那个人就走了。俄国工人就对我说：“不要干了，我们向克伦斯基示威去！”我很相信他们的话，放下工作，把手一擦，就跟上工人队伍冲到街上去。
    大街上的工人兄弟真多呵！哪个厂子的都有。队伍里飘扬着红旗，高举着标语牌，浩浩荡荡地走过大街，汇集到一座大广场上。许多海、陆军兵士也来了，工人们热烈鼓掌，和他们拥抱，亲密地站在一起，“乌拉”声震动了全彼得格勒。广场上，有人站在临时搭成的讲台上，发表演说。布尔什维克宣传家的言语，打动了我们工人的心，使我们看到了光明，增加了无穷的力量。这样又过了几个月，伟大的十月革命终于爆发了。
    1920年夏天，列宁格勒成立了联共（布）中国支部。有一位负责同志，名叫鲍列万诺夫。他会说中国话，经常和我们在一起谈政治，教我们学俄文。到了规定的学习时间，要是我没去，他就亲自来找我。在鲍列万诺夫和中国支部的帮助下，我开始懂得了一些革命道理，心里慢慢亮堂起来。我远离祖国，远离乡亲，来到俄国谋生，受尽了资本家的压迫和剥削，受尽了俄国工头的欺负。十月革命以后，我这个无亲无靠的中国工人，才得到了温暖，得到了友谊。我那时革命道理懂得很少，还只是个共产主义同情者。
    1921年3月，离列宁格勒不远的军港——喀琅施塔得发生反革命叛乱。形势很紧张，革命遭到严重困难。反革命分子狂呼：只要苏埃维，不要布尔什维克！这时，鲍列万诺夫找到我，对我说：“我们的武装部队都已经开走，镇压喀琅施塔得的反革命叛乱去了。列宁格勒正处在险境，白党和资产阶级随时可能发生暴乱，妄想推翻我们的政权。咱们工人应该武装起来，保卫自己的政权。”
    我说：“布尔什维克给我什么工作，我一定尽力去做。”
    鲍列万诺夫对我的回答很满意，立刻写了一张字条交给我。我按照他的指示，来到?夫斯基大街四十一号——联共（布）第一区区党部。这里的人可真多呵！大楼里全是人，他们都在等候分配任务。我挤进人群，费了好大的劲才走进办公室，把鲍列万诺夫给我的指示告诉了区党部的同志。他们马上找来了个中国工人，给我介绍说：“这是你们的队长朱万福同志，你听他的指挥。”
    深夜，四周寂静。?瓦河上的风吹来，使人感到凉意。我们这支二十多人的中国工人巡逻队，背着步枪，排成整齐的队列，在大街小巷巡逻放哨。区委会同志给我们交代的很清楚，要时刻提高警惕，准备随时镇压彼得格勒的白党叛乱，捍卫工人阶级的祖国。
    过了几天，喀琅施塔得的反革命叛乱被镇压下去，巡逻队也就解散了。
    莫斯科东方劳动共产主义大学
    1921年夏天，在莫斯科创办了东方劳动共产主义大学。经联共（布）中国支部的介绍，我来到了莫斯科。学校的地址在斯特拉斯特纳广场（即现在的普希金广场）附近。刚到的时候，还没有校舍，我们两个中国人就睡在一个俱乐部的戏台上。直到9月开学，我们才搬进宿舍。这是一座五层楼房，房檐上覆盖着琉璃瓦，从大玻璃窗上望出去，可以看到广场和普希金的铜像。校长是普罗伊德，经常跟我们讲各民族的风俗习惯，有时还拿出各民族的服装来，使我们了解那些民族的爱好和文化特色。全校有一千多学生，中国、蒙古、朝鲜、印度、日本人都有。中国班有四十多个同学。从1921年到1924年，陆续来莫斯科东方劳动共产主义大学学习的有任弼时、王若飞、赵世炎、萧劲光、许之桢和萧三等同志。那时我基本上还是个文盲，俄文、中文还只认识几个简单的字。任弼时和王若飞同志很关心我的学习，经常教我认字、写字。中国班有党的组织，后来我入了党。
    当时，我们的生活很苦，但比起一些苏联同志，就好得多了。我们全部穿的草绿色的麻布军衣，扎着皮带，戴着尖帽子。苏联的皮靴太大，我们穿上，前面还空着一大截子，穿不了几天，靴头就翘起来了。有一次，我们一些同学在一起照像，大家站到一堆，一个个的靴头都翘得老高，看起来非常有趣。
    1921年苏联正闹饥荒，每人一天只能领到一公斤黑面包。我们的课堂很简陋，用具也很差，用的铅笔又粗又硬，写在纸上，一戳就破。谁也没有一个像样的本子，每个人发给一大张纸，由自己裁好，订成本子用。讲义全是油印的。上课时，除了俄文课以外，其余的课程都要经过李中吾给大家翻译。
    我记得瞿秋白同志当时也给我们讲过课。他讲的是社会科学。秋白同志当时是“晨报”驻莫斯科记者，他有工作，又是记者，经济比较宽裕些。他独自住在一个小房间里。有时不知从哪里搞到点大米，见我们来了，就说：“我刚刚弄了点大米，做好了大家一块吃。”
    日子虽然苦一点，大家精神上都很愉快。我们按时参加星期六义务劳动。校方把任务一分配下来，我们一千多个同学就排着队，敲着铜鼓，吹着洋号，到工地挖坑，抬木板。同学们还组织了娱乐队，逢年过节开晚会时，我们按照祖国的习惯扎上富有民族特色的中国彩灯，外国朋友看了都很惊奇。演戏时，莫斯科艺术学校特别派员帮助我们排戏。萧三和我还有一些同志，都参加过演出。
    在莫斯科东方劳动共产主义大学，我们经常可以得到国内的消息。许多从国内来的党的同志，都要给我们作报告，1923年，我们讨论过国内的罢工问题；1924年，我们连续开了许多会议，热烈地讨论过国共合作问题。
    在我即将离开莫斯科东方劳动共产主义大学的时候，遭遇了一件永生难忘的最大的不幸事件：1924年1月21日，我们无产阶级伟大的领袖和导师列宁同志，在莫斯科附近的高尔克村逝世了。恶耗传来，很多同学都哭了。学校立即召开了追悼大会，普罗伊德校长沉痛地讲了话。次日早晨，全体整队到工会圆柱大厅谒灵。那天人很多，大家排成长长的行列，默默地伫候着。我们等了一个上午，才两个人排成一行，缓慢地走进大厅。列宁同志的灵柩停放在高台上，伏罗希洛夫和布尔加宁同志站在两旁。我轻轻地移动着脚步，不由得热泪盈眶，快到门口的时候，我还尽量地折转头来，想要最后看一眼列宁同志的遗容。
    星期日，漫天浓雾，气候奇寒。一清早，我们的队伍就开始到红场附近的一条大街上。这时，大街小巷人山人海，但却十分肃穆、宁静。全城下半旗，吊着黑纱；全体劳动人民，在礼炮声中，为全世界无产阶级伟大的领袖和导师列宁同志送殡。
    1924年6月，我从东方劳动共产主义大学毕业了。在苏联，我曾经先后作过党的工作、职工运动和农业等方面的工作，一直到前几个月，我才从苏联回到祖国。我今年六十二岁了，三十多年来，我能够忠实地为共产主义事业而工作，是和列宁的教导和莫斯科东方劳动共产主义大学的教育和培养分不开的。
