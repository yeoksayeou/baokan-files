Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, October 29th: Soviet athletes currently hold more than one-third of all world records in various sports. In 1955 and 1956 alone, Soviet athletes set 192 new world records, which is unmatched by any other country.

During the Tsarist era in Russia, only a small group of aristocrats participated in sports activities, and the results were among the worst in Europe. In 1912, Russia participated in the Olympic Games held in Stockholm and ranked sixteenth among eighteen countries. However, in 1952, when the Soviet Union participated in the Olympic Games for the first time, it achieved the same success as the United States, which had always maintained an advantage in the sports arena. By the 16th Olympic Games in 1956, the achievements of Soviet athletes had surpassed those of the United States.

Currently, Soviet athletes hold world champion titles in Greco-Roman wrestling, gymnastics, modern pentathlon, shooting, weightlifting, chess, women's volleyball, women's fencing, and speed skating. In addition, they hold European champion titles in rowing, diving, boxing, skating, basketball, and track and field.

In 1955 and 1956, Soviet athletes broke national records as many as 584 times. There are now about 10,000 honored athletes and masters of sports, and more than 71,000 first-class athletes throughout the Soviet Union.

These achievements are gained on the basis of the mass character of the development of sports undertakings, which proves that the Soviet system provides broad possibilities for the comprehensive development of people's talents. On average, one out of every ten of the Soviet Union's approximately 200 million residents is an athlete, which is more than any other country. This number does not include people who do not participate in sports associations but choose their favorite sports for exercise. The widespread development of sports in the Soviet Union is amazing.

The state's expenditure on health and sports undertakings is increasing year by year. There was no higher sports college in pre-revolutionary Russia, but now the Soviet Union has 47 higher and secondary sports colleges, and 106 normal colleges have sports departments.

Soviet athletes also regard promoting friendly cooperation among people of all countries as an important part of their activities. Last year alone, the Soviet Union sent a total of 188 sports delegations to foreign countries to conduct friendly matches with athletes from various countries, and invited 220 sports teams from various countries to visit the Soviet Union.

    体育事业具有广泛群众基础
    苏联运动员创造世界纪录最多
    据新华社莫斯科29日电　苏联运动员目前保持着三分之一以上的各种体育运动的世界纪录，在1955年和1956年两年中，苏联运动员就创造了一百九十二项新的世界纪录，这是任何其他国家所不及的。
    俄国沙皇时代，参加体育活动的只是一小撮贵族的事，体育成绩也是欧洲最糟的一个。1912年俄国参加了在斯德哥尔摩举行的奥林匹克运动会，在十八个国家中，它名列第十六。但是1952年，苏联第一次参加奥运会就同一直在体育场上保持着优势的美国取得同样的成就，到1956年第十六届奥运会上，苏联运动员获得的成绩已经超过了美国。
    目前苏联运动员保持着古典摔跤、体操、现代五项运动、射击、举重、象棋、女子排球、女子击剑和滑冰等项目的世界冠军称号，此外还保持着划艇、跳水、拳击、滑冰、篮球和田径等项目的欧洲冠军称号。
    1955年和1956年中，苏联运动员刷新了国家纪录达五百八十四次之多，现在全苏联有一万名左右的功勋运动员和运动健将，七万一千多名一级运动员。
    这些成就都是在体育事业发展的群众性基础上获得的，它证明了苏维埃制度提供了广阔的可能性，使得人民的天才获得全面的发展。在苏联的两亿左右的居民中平均每十人中就有一个运动员，任何国家的运动员都没有这样多。这个数目还不包括没有参加体育协会而也选择自己喜好的项目进行锻炼的人。苏联体育运动的普遍开展是惊人的。
    国家用于保健体育事业方面的费用年年在增加。革命前的俄国没有一所高等的体育学院，而现在苏联有四十七所高等和中等体育学院，一百零六个师范学院中设有体育系科。
    苏联运动员还把促进各国人民友好合作作为他们活动的重要内容之一，去年一年中苏联一共派出一百八十八个各种体育代表队到国外去同各国运动员进行友谊比赛，并且邀请了各国二百二十个体育队到苏联访问。
