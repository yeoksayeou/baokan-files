　　 本报南京10日电: This newspaper's dispatch from Nanjing, October 10th: Over the past two months, the socialist great debate centered on the grain issue has unfolded in the vast countryside of Jiangsu Province, achieving significant results on both the grain and ideological fronts.

　　In areas where the great "letting go," "speaking out," and debating were carried out, cadres' morale soared, and undesirable work styles were improved. In particular, the major rights and wrongs of the grain issue were clarified, cadres and the masses reported actual yields, the "head-butting" mentality was eliminated, and procurement work progressed faster. Although the late rice in the Taihu Lake basin and dry-to-wet paddy fields areas has not yet been harvested, by the end of September, the province had completed 46.6% of its annual grain procurement task, exceeding the 49% of the same period last year. Xuzhou, where the great "letting go," "speaking out," and debating were carried out well, has now completed its annual grain procurement task. Yancheng and Yangzhou Special Districts have also completed more than 80% of their annual procurement tasks. After Xinghua County conducted education on loyalty and honesty among cadres at all levels and debated the major rights and wrongs of the grain issue, townships and cooperatives re-reported nearly 50 million jin of concealed and privately divided grain. The grain currently stored in warehouses is 18% more than in the same period in the bumper year of 1955, and five times more than in the same period last year. During the great debate, many farmers recognized the superiority of cooperation, and those who wanted to withdraw from the cooperatives no longer did so. Many individual households also actively requested to join the cooperatives. More than 600 cooperatives in Jiangdu and Taixian counties with serious problems of wanting to withdraw from the cooperatives have all returned to normal production order. More than 3,000 households of cooperative members in Wujin, Wujiang, and Wuxi counties who originally wanted to withdraw from the cooperatives now firmly stated that they would no longer waver, and more than 2,300 individual households requested to join the cooperatives.

　　However, the development of the movement is very uneven. In some areas, "letting go" is not deep enough, "speaking out" is not thorough enough, and the debate is not clear enough. One of the main reasons for this situation is that some leading cadres and grassroots cadres do not fully understand the significance of the nationwide rectification campaign in the countryside. They mistakenly regard the socialist great debate as a means to complete the procurement task, and therefore, in areas where the procurement task has not been completed, hasty phenomena such as indiscriminate labeling have occurred. In areas where the grain task has been completed, cadres believe that "the grain task has been completed almost completely, and the masses have no opinions. What is there to debate? If we continue to debate, isn't it just asking for trouble?" Therefore, they want to end the debate hastily. Furthermore, some grassroots cadres hold the erroneous attitude of "rectifying people" and have not made up their minds to improve their work style in the movement. Some township cadres in Peixian said: "The son is good for three months, the dog is good for three months. After suffering for a thousand days, now it's time for us to vent our anger." Some cooperative cadres in Wangji Township, Juning County, even held meetings in private, threatening the masses behind the backs of the work teams and preventing them from speaking out. For example, the head of the Lianfeng Cooperative said to the masses: "The work team was sent by the county, you can't talk nonsense."

　　Another reason for this situation is that the right-leaning sentiments of some cadres have not been thoroughly corrected. They underestimated the awareness of the masses, and therefore, they were afraid that they would not be able to "let go" and that "letting go" would become chaotic and unmanageable. In Jiangyin County, many grassroots cadres stipulated many rules and regulations for "speaking out," such as: "letting go" is allowed in places where the awareness of cooperative members is high, but not in places where the awareness is low; "letting go" is allowed in places where the cadres are good, but not in places where the cadres have many shortcomings; correct opinions can be "let go," but wrong opinions cannot be "let go"; "letting go" is allowed in advanced cooperatives, but not in elementary cooperatives, and so on. When the Weiguo Cooperative in Dafeng County held a meeting, they did not dare to mobilize the masses to "speak out," but first talked about the legal system, and as a result, no one dared to express any opinions.

　　The above situation has attracted the attention of the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the local committees.

    粮食征购工作迅速进展　农民觉悟程度大大提高
    江苏农村大辩论效果显著
    有些地区还放得不深鸣得不透辩得不明
    本报南京10日电　最近两个多月来，江苏省广大农村以粮食问题为中心的社会主义大辩论已经展开，在粮食和思想两条战线上取得了显著的成果。
    凡是展开大鸣大放大辩论的地区，干部情绪高涨，不良的作风也得到改进，特别是分清了粮食问题的大是大非，干部群众报实了产量，“顶牛”情绪消除了，征购工作也进行得较快。太湖流域和旱改水田地区的晚稻虽然还没有收割，但到9月底，全省已完成全年粮食征购任务的46.6％，超过去年同期的49％。大鸣大放大辩论搞得较好的徐州，目前已完成了全年粮食征购任务，盐城、扬州专区也已完成全年征购任务的80％以上。兴化县在各级干部中进行忠诚老实的教育、辩论了粮食问题的大是大非以后，乡、社共补报出隐瞒私分的粮食近五千万斤，目前已入库的粮食比丰收的1955年同期多18％，比去年同期多五倍。在大辩论中，许多农民都认识了合作化的优越性，要求退社的也不退社了，许多单干户也纷纷要求入社。江都、泰县六百多个闹退社问题较严重的社，已全部恢复正常生产秩序。武进、吴江、无锡三县原有三千多户社员要求退社，现在也坚决表示不再动摇，而且还有二千三百多户单干户要求入社。
    但是运动开展得很不平衡，有些地区还放得不深，鸣得不透，辩得不明。造成这种情况的主要原因之一是部分领导干部和基层干部对于农村全民性整风的意义认识不足。他们错误地把社会主义大辩论当作完成征购任务的手段，因而在未完成征购任务的地区，发生了乱扣帽子等急躁现象；在已完成粮食任务的地区，干部认为“粮食任务已完成得差不多了，群众也没有什么意见了，还辩什么呢？再辩论下去，不是自找麻烦吗？”因此想草率收兵。更有些基层干部抱着“整人”的错误态度，没有下决心在运动中改进自己的工作作风。沛县有些乡干部就这样说：“儿子三月狗三月，受了一千天的气，现在该让我们出出气了。”雎宁县王集乡有些社干部竟私自开会，背着工作组威吓群众，不让他们鸣放。如联丰社社长对群众说：“工作组是县里派来的，你们不能胡说八道。”
    造成这种情况的另一个原因，是部分干部的右倾情绪未得到彻底的纠正。他们过低地估计了群众的觉悟，因而既怕放不起来，又怕放乱了不可收拾。江阴县就有不少基层干部对鸣放规定了许多清规戒律，如：社员觉悟高的地方可以放，觉悟低的地方不能放；干部好的地方可以放，干部缺点多的不能放；正确的意见可以放，错误的意见不能放；高级社能放，初级社不能放等等。大丰县卫国社开会时不敢发动群众鸣放，却先谈法制，结果没有人敢提意见。
    上述情况，已引起中共江苏省委及各地委的注意。
