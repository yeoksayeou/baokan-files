    Autumn Scenery of the Plain
　　By Sun Xiaoping
    This year's autumn seedlings are growing well
    This year's autumn seedlings are growing well,
    The millet is all as tall as a person,
    Production team members go to weed,
    They bow their heads and disappear.
    There's a famous big guy, Uncle Zengming,
    He needs to bend over to enter the gate;
    He goes to the millet field to pull the hoe ditch,
    Only a yellow straw hat can be seen.
    Commune members walk down the path in the afternoon,
    The wind blows the millet, swaying east and west,
    People's bodies suddenly low and suddenly high,
    Like swimming home.
    A gentle autumn breeze blows
    A gentle autumn breeze blows,
    The willow branches hurriedly wave goodbye,
    The poplars also keep shaking their heads in farewell,
    Only the jujube tree stands still.
    It's not that the jujube tree is arrogant and conceited,
    Nor is it that the jujube tree is disrespectful to the wind,
    It's just that this year's jujubes are hanging so densely,
    Strings of red dates are weighing it down.
                      From the Southern Hebei Plain

    平原秋景
　　孙肖平
    今年的秋苗长得好
    今年的秋苗长得好，
    谷子都有一人高，
    生产队员去锄草，
    低下头儿不见了。
    有名大个增明叔，
    进门需要弯弯腰；
    他去谷地拉锄沟，
    只见一顶黄草帽。
    社员下晌走小道，
    风吹谷子东西摇，
    人身忽低又忽高，
    好似游水往家漂。
    吹来了一阵微微的秋风
    吹来了阵阵的秋风，
    柳树枝急忙的摆手欢送，
    白杨树也不住的摇头话别，
    唯有那枣树一动不动。
    并不是枣树高傲自大，
    也不是枣树儿对风不敬，
    只因为今年枣儿挂的稠，
    串串红枣压的重。
                      于冀南平原
