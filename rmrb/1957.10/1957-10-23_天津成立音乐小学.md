Tianjin Establishes Music Elementary School

    Tianjin’s first music elementary school dedicated to cultivating children with musical talent, the Tianjin Music Elementary School, has officially opened.

    The predecessor of this school was the Central Conservatory of Music's affiliated extracurricular music elementary school for children. Cheng Qi, the son of a pedicab worker, had never touched a piano before, but after two years of enthusiastic teaching by teachers, he is now able to play common sonatinas. Yu Congheng, nine years old, plays the violin with a melodious sound and has been praised by Soviet violin experts. The school is jointly run by the Central Conservatory of Music and the Tianjin Municipal Cultural and Educational Departments. It is affiliated with the Central Conservatory of Music Middle School and five other locations including Tianjin Experimental Elementary School. It has three research groups for piano, violin, and cello. In addition to music classes, students also study the cultural courses of ordinary elementary schools. The school currently has 134 students, including 78 new students. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    天津成立音乐小学
    天津市专门培养具有音乐才能的儿童的第一所音乐小学——天津市音乐小学已经正式开学。
    这个学校的前身是中央音乐学院附属儿童课余音乐小学。三轮车工人的儿子程起过去从来没有摸过钢琴，经过老师两年来的热心教导，现在已能弹奏一般小奏鸣曲了。九岁的于聪珩的小提琴演奏，婉转动听，受到了苏联小提琴专家的称赞。这所学校是由中央音乐学院和天津市文化教育部门联合举办的，附设在中央音乐学院附中和天津市实验小学等五处，有钢琴、小提琴和大提琴三个研究组，学生们除了学习音乐课以外，还要学习普通小学的文化课程。这个学校现有学生一百三十四名，其中有七十八名新生。　（据新华社讯）
