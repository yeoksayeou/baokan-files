　　Vietnam's Territory is Inviolable
　　——A Record of the "Unification Struggle" Photo Exhibition of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam
　　By Our Correspondent Xiao Guang
    The "Unification Struggle" photo exhibition recently held by the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in Hanoi attracts tens of thousands of visitors every day. People from all walks of life, including gray-haired elders and innocent children, are eagerly coming here to learn about the actual situation of their motherland in detail. In the face of countless vivid facts, they are even more aware of the importance of "strengthening the struggle for the peaceful reunification of the motherland."

    The theme of the exhibition is very clear. It uses many historical and survey materials, pictures, and models to illustrate that Vietnam has been a unified entity for nearly two hundred years; from the Friendship Pass to Cape Ca Mau, the twenty-five million Vietnamese people living on this land speak the same language and share a common economic and cultural life.

    Look, history clearly records that Vietnam's border extended south to Quảng Trị from the Yuan Long Fu era of the Lý Dynasty in 1104, and until 1758 the border extended south to Tân Châu; the people spent a full six hundred and fifty years unifying the country. And for nearly eighty years, in order to resist the French colonialists' "divide and conquer" conspiracy, the Vietnamese people heroically carried out wave after wave of anti-French movements. The Bắc Giang peasant uprising, the mountain tribe uprising, the Thái Nguyên uprising, the Nghệ An Soviet movement, the Bắc Sơn uprising, the Southern uprising, the Đô Lương uprising, the Ba Tơ guerrilla movement... Here, every brief term marks a great patriotic epic. The walls of the exhibition are excerpted with many touching verses praising the anti-French movement.

    The birth of the Indochinese Communist Party in 1930 became a major event in the political life of the Vietnamese people. The magnificent liberation movement has since unfolded under the leadership of the Party. The Vietnam Workers' Party, founded in 1951, inherited its glorious struggle tradition and insisted on leading the people in the war of resistance. From the introduction of a series of pictures of the war of resistance in Vietnam, the great victory of Điện Biên Phủ, the Geneva Conference, the ceasefire, the regrouping, and the takeover of the new areas, we can see how important the complete liberation of the North was for the Vietnamese people. Of course, the task of struggle has not ended there.

    Although the Geneva Accords clearly stipulated that Vietnam should hold a general election to achieve unification in July 1956, Vietnam is still in a state of north-south division. This situation brings great difficulties to both sides.

    As everyone knows, North Vietnam has abundant mineral resources, such as coal, zinc, tin, etc., as well as many industrial enterprises such as cement, textiles, and silk; the South has fertile land and produces a large amount of rice, rubber, cotton, coconut oil, sugar cane, pepper... For many years, the South's agricultural products and industrial raw materials have promoted the development of the North's industry, and the North's industrial products have supplied the needs of the Southern market. Today, in North Vietnam, the democratic government needs to import sugar, rubber, coconut oil... from foreign countries every year, but these products in South Vietnam are largely unsalable. South Vietnamese enterprises cannot use Hòn Gai coal and Hải Phòng cement, which they have always used nearby, and have to buy them from the United States and Japan. From 1954 to 1956, South Vietnam imported 106,184 tons of American coal and 445,715 tons of Japanese cement. Due to the long distance and high freight costs, a considerable amount of foreign exchange has to be spent. In addition, the boilers of South Vietnamese industrial enterprises, which were previously built according to the specifications for burning Hòn Gai coal, have been greatly damaged and affected the reduction of output because their performance is not compatible with American coal.

    The emotional pain that the divided situation brings to the Vietnamese people is even harder to express.

    The architecture, clothing, diet, and customs of the North and South are so similar; it cannot but make people often feel sentimental. We see that the Đồng Xuân Market in Hanoi, the Bến Thành Market in Saigon, and the Bình Tây Market in Chợ Lớn are like sisters. The Cổ Lễ Temple in Nam Định, the Lê Văn Duyệt Tomb in Gia Định, the Tiêu Sơn Temple in Bắc Ninh, and the Thập Tháp Temple in An Nhơn, although in different places, maintain a unified architectural style. The coconut groves of Thanh Hóa and Hà Tiên are equally beautiful and charming, and the coast of Hà Tiên and the beaches of Sầm Sơn are difficult to distinguish at a glance. It is no wonder that people going down the Red River naturally think of the rushing currents of the Mekong River; and walking along the Mã River always reminds them of the Perfume River. Moreover, men and women on both sides of the North and South like to dress in pineapple silk shirts and pants; and the girls in Hanoi and Saigon wear the same tight-fitting, floor-length dresses. Moreover, people love music and playing the zither regardless of North or South. They recite "The Tale of Kiều" or "Lục Vân Tiên" with the same gentle language and emotion.

    In front of the map of Vietnamese products, the commentator sang like a folk song: Bình Định coconut oil, Hòn Gai coal, Hà Đông silk, Vĩnh Bảo cigarettes, Quảng Ngãi sugar cane, Phú Quốc fish sauce... My Vietnamese friend told me that this is not just a simple list of materials, it reflects the flesh-and-blood feelings of the Vietnamese people. Vietnamese families have been proud of having these famous products of their motherland for daily needs for generations, but now they can't do it. Today, not a liter of rice, nor a child can cross the 17th parallel, although the people of both the North and South long for material, especially emotional, exchanges.

    The Vietnamese people know who is constantly undermining their interests and feelings; and the large amount of information provided by the exhibition makes it clearer the conspiracy of the United States to undermine the peaceful reunification of Vietnam.

    Some organization charts of the political, economic, and military institutions in the South, drawn according to Southern newspapers, specifically illustrate how the United States has deeply and firmly grasped the entire Southern regime. For example, the US Military Assistance Advisory Group (headed by Williams), which dominates the South Vietnamese Ministry of Defense and military command, not only controls the three important departments of the General Staff, Intelligence Department, and Logistics Department of the South Vietnamese army, but also deeply controls the military regions, divisions, regiments, down to independent battalions and military schools. The US economic delegation headed by Borrows controls all the financial departments of the Southern regime. Professor Fisher of the University of Michigan has the power to decide and supervise the work of national institutions and police forces.

    65% of US aid is used for military purposes. The South Vietnamese army has been expanded to 262,000 people under US training and equipment. There are also plans to add another 20,000 regular troops.

    South Vietnam's financial budget is also full of the atmosphere of war. Among the total expenditure of 14.159 billion yuan (South Vietnamese currency) this year, the declared military expenditure is 6.59862 billion yuan. In addition, many expenses are hidden under other names. For example, 1.41529 billion yuan for "security" and 148 million yuan for the Civil Affairs Office are allocated under the office of the "Presidential" Palace, and 500 million yuan for the maintenance of the police force is included in the internal affairs expenses. In this way, the military expenses amount to 8.76191 billion yuan, accounting for more than 61% of the total expenditure for the year.

    The policy of expanding armaments and preparing for war has pushed the South Vietnamese people into poverty and misery. In the exhibited pictures, we see many people making their homes under bridges and sleeping on the sides of the streets. Many people forced to move south live in "boxes" made of lead sheets.

    The massive dumping of American goods has greatly hit South Vietnam's industry, forestry, and native product development. South Vietnam's exports have plummeted. In 1955, exports were equal to 26% of imports, and in 1956 they fell to only 20% of imports. South Vietnam, which has always exported rice, not only did not export in 1956, but imported more than 28,000 tons of American rice. South Vietnam's productivity is constantly weakening, and handicraft and small industries have gone bankrupt one after another. At present, only 120 of the original 600 sugar factories are operating, and 60% of the spinning machines have stopped running. The number of unemployed people in South Vietnam has reached 1,658,000.

    All democratic and free rights of the people have been strangled. The misfortune of search, arrest, interrogation, and imprisonment in concentration camps... may come at any time. Publications are subject to strict inspection by the authorities. Recently, twenty kinds of newspapers and periodicals have been banned from publication one after another, and six reformed opera troupes have been forced to disband.

    What is exciting is the firm will of the South Vietnamese people to strive for national reunification. In the past three years, regardless of fascist terror and the torture of life, they have carried out unyielding struggles in diverse and flexible ways. From anti-hunger, anti-persecution, anti-massacre, anti-Latin, anti-occupation of land, demanding wage increases, demanding the dissolution of concentration camps..., to holding large-scale "May Day" demonstrations; people from all walks of life have become more and more united and stronger and stronger through successive struggles.

    Under the large title of "North and South Unite as One, Resolutely Fight, and Unify the Country!" handwritten accusations, protest letters signed in various inks or printed with fingerprints, and countless photos and pictures documenting the bloodshed and sacrifices made for issuing these accusations and protest letters are displayed here. The pictures of the North Vietnamese people striving for peaceful reunification, as well as the upsurge in production and construction to consolidate the North and the great achievements they have made, are also exhibited here. Together with more than 300 works of art and sculpture exhibited in the latter part, it fully demonstrates the iron will and the confidence of victory of the Vietnamese people to strive for reunification.

    We have seen many visitors sigh softly in front of the "South under American Control" section, they kiss the leaves of the Bình Định coconut tree, touch the South Vietnamese newspapers, and blink their moist eyes as they read the postcards sent from the South. But when they visit this section of the North, they gradually become invigorated and active.

    This mood is very natural and common, people get encouragement from here and strengthen their beliefs. Let's take a look at the messages of a few visitors: A bridge engineer is determined to build a bridge on the Hiền Lương River on the 17th parallel, a bridge to "restore normal relations between the North and South," so that the emotions and materials of the North and South compatriots can flow freely. Soldier Phạm Đức said: The greatest inspiration the exhibition gave him was to make him often think about "what can he do for the struggle to unify the country?" Nguyễn Bá Lâm, a public security cadre who was regrouped from South Vietnam, wrote: "It has been three years since I left home. Seeing the pictures of the suffering of the Southern compatriots under the rule of the US-Ngô, I miss my dear family even more. Tears welled up in my eyes. But tears cannot bring us happiness. I want to turn painful feelings into strength, strive for the reunification of the motherland with excellent work achievements, and welcome the reunion of the family!"

　　越南的国土不容分割
　　——记越南民主共和国“统一斗争”图片展览会
　　本报记者  萧光
    越南民主共和国最近在河内举办的“统一斗争”图片展览会，每天吸引着成千上万的观众。各界人民，包括那些白发苍苍的老人和天真活泼的儿童，都争先恐后地来到这里，详尽地了解祖国各方面的实际状况。他们在无数生动的事实面前，更加认识到“为实现祖国的和平统一而加强斗争”的重要意义。
    展览会的主题十分鲜明。它用许多历史、调查材料、图片和模型等，说明越南近二百年来就是统一的整体；从睦南关到金瓯角，生活在这片土地上的二千五百万越南人说着一样的语言、有着共同的经济、文化生活。
    你看，历史明白记载着：越南从1104年李朝元龙符年代边界南延到广治，直到1758年边界南延到新洲；人民曾整整花了六百五十多年的时间来使国家统一。而近八十多年来为了反击法国殖民者“分而治之”的阴谋，越南人民英勇地进行了此伏彼起的抗法运动。北江农民起义、山区氏族起义、太原起义、宜安苏维埃运动、北山起义、南部起义、都良起义、巴斯游击运动……这里，每一个简短的名词都标志着一部伟大的爱国史诗。展览会的墙上就摘录了许多歌颂抗法运动的感人的诗句。
    1930年印度支那共产党的诞生，成为越南人民政治生活中的一个重大事件。波澜壮阔的解放运动，从此在党的领导下展开了。1951年成立的越南劳动党，继承了它光辉的斗争传统，坚持领导人民抗战。我们从抗战的越南、奠边府大捷、日内瓦会议、停火、集结、接管新区等一系列图片的介绍中，可以看出北方的完全解放对于越南人民是一个多么重要的胜利。当然，斗争的任务并没有就此结束。
    尽管日内瓦协议明文规定，越南应在1956年7月举行实现统一的普选，但越南仍然处在南北分割的状态下。这种局面给双方都带来很大的困难。
    大家知道，越南北方拥有丰富的矿产，像煤、锌、锡等，还有水泥、纺织、丝绸等许多工业企业；南方土地肥沃，出产大量的稻米、橡胶、棉花、椰油、甘蔗、胡椒……。多少年来，南方的农产品和工业原料促进北方工业的发展，北方的工业品供应着南方市场的需要。而今在北越，民主政府每年需要从外国输入食糖、橡胶、椰油……，南越的这些产品却大量滞销。南越各企业不能就近使用它们一向所使用的鸿基煤炭和海防水泥，而不得不去向美国和日本购买。自1954到1956年的三年中，南越已进口十万零六千一百八十四吨美国煤和四十四万五千七百一十五吨日本水泥。由于路途远，运费高，得花费一笔不小的外汇。此外，南越工业企业以前按照烧用鸿基煤的规格建造的锅炉，因为性能同美国煤不适应，损坏很大，影响产量降低。
    分割的局面带给越南人民感情上的痛苦，更是一言难尽。
    南北的建筑、服饰、饮食、习俗是这样的相近；它不能不使人们时常触景生情。我们看到：河内同春市场、西贡边城市场和堤岸评西市场，跟姊妹一般相像。南定古礼寺、嘉定黎文阅寺、北宁的萧山寺、安仁的十铁寺，虽然各处一方，却保持着统一的建筑风格。清化和河仙的椰林同样地清丽迷人，河仙的海岸、岑山的沙滩，一下子很难分清。难怪人们沿着红河顺流而下，很自然会想起湄公河的湍湍急流；在马河边上散步总忘不了香河。何况南北两方的男男女女都喜欢菠萝绸褂裤的打扮；河内和西贡的姑娘穿着一式紧身曳地的长衣。何况人们不分南北地爱好音乐、爱弹六弦琴。他们用同样轻柔的语言，充满感情地吟唱“金云翘”或是“陆云仙”。
    在越南物产地图跟前，解说员像背民谣似的唱道：平定椰油、鸿基煤炭、河东丝绸、永宝京烟、广义蔗糖、富国岛鱼露……。同行的越南朋友告诉我，这不仅是简单的物资名称，它反映着越南人民骨肉般的感情。越南家庭世世代代都以日常齐备和应用这些祖国的名产而自豪，但是如今却怎么也办不到。今天，没有一公升大米，也没有一个小孩可以越过十七纬线，尽管南北人民都渴望物资，特别是情感的交流。
    越南人民知道是谁不断损害着他们之间的利益和情感；而展览会提供的大量资料，使人更清楚美国破坏越南和平统一的阴谋。
    一些根据南方报刊绘制的南方政治、经济、军事机构的组织体系图表，具体地说明了美国怎样深入和牢牢地抓住整个南方政权。例如，支配着南越国防部和军事指挥部的美国军事顾问团（以威廉斯为首），不仅控制了南越军队的总参谋部、情报部和后勤部三个重要机构，还深入控制了各军区、师、团，直到各个独立营和各军事学校。以伯罗斯为首的美国经济代表团，掌握着南方政权的一切财经部门。美国密执安大学的教授费希尔，握有决定监督国家机构和警察部队工作的大权。
    美援65％用于军事。南越军队在美国的训练和装备下，已扩充到二十六万二千人。目前还计划再增加二万正规军。
    南越的财政预算也充满了战争气氛。在今年一百四十一亿五千九百万元（南越币）的总支出当中，公开的军事开支是六十五亿九千八百六十二万元。此外，还有许多费用隐蔽在其他名目下面。如十四亿一千五百二十九万元的“保安”费和一亿四千八百万元的公民署经费，拨在“总统”府办公厅的款下，五亿元的警察部队维持费包括在内务费里。这样，军事方面的费用就达八十七亿六千一百九十一万元，占全年总支出的61％以上。
    扩军备战的政策，将南越人民推入贫困、悲惨的境地。在展出的图片中，我们看到不少人在桥洞底下安家，在街道两旁露宿。许多被迫南迁的人住在铅皮搭成的“盒子”里。
    美国商品的大量倾销，使得南越的工业、林业和土产开发大受打击。南越的出口量锐减，1955年出口货等于进口货的26％，1956年下降到只等于进口的20％。一向输出大米的南越，1956年不但没有输出，反而输入美国大米二万八千多吨。南越的生产力不断削弱，手工业和小工业纷纷破产。目前，原有的六百家造糖厂中只有一百二十家开工，60％的纺纱机停止了运转。南越失业的人数已达一百六十五万八千人。
    人民的一切民主自由权利都遭到扼杀。搜查、逮捕、审讯、坐集中营……的横祸，随时可能飞来头上。出版物受到当局严厉的检查。近来已有二十种报刊先后被禁止出版，六个改良剧团被迫解散。
    令人兴奋的是南越人民争取国家统一的坚决意志。三年来，他们不顾法西斯的恐怖、生活的折磨，以多样的、灵活的方式进行了不屈不挠的斗争。从反饥饿、反迫害、反屠杀、反拉丁、反占夺田地、要求增薪、要求解散集中营……，到举行大规模的“五一”示威游行；各阶层人民通过历次的斗争越来越团结，越来越坚强。
    在“南北一致团结、坚决斗争、统一国家！”的大标题下，这里展出了南越人民手抄的控诉书、用各种墨水签名或印上指纹的抗议书，还有无数记录了为发出这些控诉书、抗议书而流血牺牲的照片、图画。这里也展出了北越人民争取和平统一，以及为巩固北方而投入生产建设的热潮和取得巨大成就的图片。连同后一部分展出的三百多件美术和雕塑作品，它充分表现出越南全国人民争取统一的钢铁意志和必胜的信心。
    我们曾看到不少观众在“美国控制下的南方”的栏目跟前轻声叹息，他们亲吻平定椰树的叶子，抚摸南越报纸，眨着湿润的眼睛念叨南方寄来的明信片。但是当他们参观到北方这一栏的时候，就渐渐变得振作和活跃起来。
    这种心情原很自然和普遍，人们从这里获得了鼓舞，加强了信念。让我们看看几位观众的留言吧：一位桥梁工程师决心在十七线的贤良江上，建造一座“恢复南北正常关系”的大桥，让南北同胞的情感和物资畅快地交流。军人范德说：展览会给他最大的启发，是使他经常想到自己“要为统一国家的斗争做些什么？”从南越集结来的公安干部阮伯林写道：“离家已经三年了，看到南方同胞在美—吴统治下受苦难的图片，更加想念我亲爱的家人。我的眼泪夺眶而出了。但是泪水也不能给我们带来幸福呵。我要把痛苦的情感化成力量，用优秀的工作成绩争取祖国的统一，去迎接家庭的团圆！”
