Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, October 24th: At present, the manganese ore output of the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic exceeds the total output of seven countries, including the United States, Japan, Mexico, Congo, Morocco, the Federation of South Africa, and Ghana. Its steel production exceeds the total of Switzerland, Norway, and Turkey combined. According to surveys, Georgia has large deposits of manganese ore, coal, oil, and rare metals. However, before the October Revolution, resource-rich Georgia was industrially very backward. In 1913, it had only two hundred small handicraft enterprises. After the establishment of Soviet power, the republic built more than 1,300 new large industrial enterprises alone.

    格鲁吉亚盛产锰矿砂产量超过美日墨等七国总和
    据新华社莫斯科24日电　目前，苏联格鲁吉亚共和国的锰矿砂产量超过了美国、日本、墨西哥、刚果、摩洛哥、南非联邦和加纳等七个国家的产量总和。它所生产的钢超过了瑞士、挪威和土耳其三国的总和。根据调查，格鲁吉亚境内埋藏有大量的锰矿、煤矿、石油和稀有金属。但是在十月革命以前，资源丰富的格鲁吉亚在工业上却十分落后。1913年它只有二百家小型手工业企业。在苏维埃政权建立以后，共和国单是新兴建的大工业企业就有一千三百多个。
