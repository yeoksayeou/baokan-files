Important Documents on the 40th Anniversary of the October Revolution
　　Jiang Chunfang
　　The “Outline for the Propaganda of the 40th Anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution” jointly drafted by the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the CPSU and the Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the Central Committee of the CPSU is an important document summarizing the experience of the October Revolution and the 40 years of socialist construction in the Soviet Union. The entire outline, in addition to the introduction, is divided into seven chapters and twenty-seven sections, and concisely and profoundly narrates the victory of the October Socialist Revolution and the establishment of the Soviet proletarian dictatorship, the completion of socialist society, the victory of the Great Patriotic War, and the summary of postwar communist construction, as well as the future construction tasks of the Soviet people. The outline theoretically and practically demonstrates the principles of Marxism-Leninism on socialist revolution and socialist construction, elaborates in detail the leading role of the Communist Party in the glorious victory of the Soviet people, and the great influence of the October Revolution on the people of all countries.
　　From the whole point of view, the outline focuses on five issues. The first is the role of the Party. The outline points out that the victory of the Great October Socialist Revolution and the success of the Soviet Union in building socialist communism powerfully demonstrate that: "The leading role of the vanguard of the working class—the Communist Party—is the decisive condition for the working class to fulfill its world-historical mission—overthrowing capitalism and establishing a new communist society." (People's Publishing House edition of "Outline," p. 40) "Without such a great party founded and educated by Lenin, the workers and peasants of Russia could not have destroyed the Tsarist system, overthrown Russian capitalism, seized and maintained the Soviet regime—the dictatorship of the working class, and could not have repelled the extremely fierce attacks of domestic counter-revolutionaries and foreign armed interventionists and imperialist aggressors." (Ibid.)
　　The Communist Party is a truly people's party. It constantly and continuously connects with the masses of the people, cares about the people's sufferings and welfare, and not only teaches the masses, but also learns from the masses. Therefore, the masses deeply love their party, respond to the party's call, and carry out the tasks assigned by the party. At the time of the October Revolution, the Russian party had only 240,000 brave revolutionaries, and now it has developed into a strong political force of 8 million party members and probationary members. This powerful force converges the creative labor of millions of workers, peasants, and intellectuals into a torrent, leading to a common great goal. The Party has become the soul of all creative activities of the people and is the great architect of communist society.
　　The Communist Party opposes revisionism and dogmatism, and is good at creatively applying Marxism-Leninism to solve current tasks. Therefore, the Communist Party has become "the wisdom, honor, and conscience of our time" (Lenin), the embodiment and disseminator of the great truth of our time, and the leader and organizer of all victories.
　　Second, the outline uses the most eloquent facts to prove the superiority of the socialist system. The fact that the Soviet Union—the world's first socialist country—has stood firm for 40 years powerfully illustrates the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system. The three major decisions announced after the victory of the October Revolution—the Decree on Peace, the Decree on Land, and the establishment of the Workers' and Peasants' Government—laid the foundation for the social system and state system of the first workers' country. This system embodies the wishes of the people and is therefore sincerely supported and loved by the working people. Because "the Decree on Peace opened the way to get rid of war by revolutionary means and laid the unshakable foundation for the Soviet state's peaceful foreign policy. The Decree on Land embodied the wishes of millions of peasants for generations—to eliminate landlord land ownership. The Congress's resolution on the establishment of the Workers' and Peasants' Government laid the foundation for the new Soviet state." (p. 9)
　　The new revolutionary regime established on the basis of the worker-peasant alliance is the dictatorship of the proletariat. The dictatorship of the proletariat is also proletarian democracy. "Proletarian democracy suppresses the bourgeois exploiters—therefore it does not deceive people, does not promise them freedom and democracy—but gives the laborers real democracy." (Lenin)
　　With this worker-peasant regime with the dictatorship of the proletariat as the state form, that is, a social system and state system that truly represents the vital interests of the working people, national inequality is forever eliminated, creating a truly brotherly unity of all nationalities, and it has a superiority far superior to any state system of any class in the history of the world.
　　When the workers and peasants of Russia, under the leadership of the Communist Party, began peaceful construction, the overthrown exploiting classes launched a civil war against the worker-peasant regime. International imperialists, headed by the ruling groups of Britain, the United States, and France, that is, the so-called Fourteen-Nation Allied Forces, organized an invasion against the Soviet Republic, attempting to strangle the young worker-peasant state "in the cradle." The Communist Party and the Soviet government called on the people to wage a just revolutionary patriotic war against foreign interventionists and domestic counter-revolutionaries. Under extremely difficult conditions, after three years of arduous struggle, the Russian workers and peasants finally defeated the enemy, whose strength was far superior to their own, and showed the world for the first time the superiority of the socialist system.
　　The superiority of the socialist system was then demonstrated in the work of restoring the national economy to prepare the necessary conditions for building socialism.
　　The outline lists figures to illustrate the serious damage that foreign armed interventionists brought to the Soviet national economy, setting back the already backward economy by decades. "In 1920, the products of our country's large-scale industrial production accounted for only about one-seventh of that in 1913. Pig iron production accounted for only 2.7% of that before the war, cement production accounted for only 2.4% of that before the war, soap production accounted for only 7.1% of that before the war, and cotton textile production accounted for only 4% of that before the war. At that time, steel production dropped to an annual output of 200,000 tons." (p. 15) "Relying solely on themselves, on their own strength and funds, the Soviet people overcame the unprecedented difficulties of economic decline and financial exhaustion in a short period of time, overcame poverty and famine, and paved the way to socialism." (Ibid.)
　　The completion of the first few five-year plans turned the Soviet state from an agricultural country into an industrial country, which further demonstrated the superiority of the socialist economic system and its great vitality. And it was precisely at this time that the entire capitalist world experienced a profound economic crisis, with industrial production reduced by 44%, and the United States alone lost 300 billion yuan in products. The Soviet people, in accordance with the socialist construction program formulated by Lenin, made brilliant achievements in national industrialization, agricultural collectivization, and cultural revolution.
　　In 1941, when the Soviet Union had already built socialism, imperialist fascist Germany used the military potential of almost the entire occupied Europe to launch a perfidious attack, interrupting the Soviet Union's peaceful construction and bringing countless disasters to the Soviet people. "But at the same time, it confirmed that the new socialist system established in the Soviet Union is solid and invincible, and the spiritual strength of the new people born of socialism and educated by the Communist Party is indestructible." (p. 21)
　　The outline uses an entire chapter, "The Great Achievements of the Soviet People in the Great Patriotic War," to analyze the nature of World War II, narrate the policies adopted by the United States and Britain before and after the war, and explain how the Soviet people, under the slogan of "Everything for the Front, Everything for Victory," went through four years of bloody battles, made unprecedented achievements, defeated fascist Germany, and liberated several occupied countries in Southeast Europe. The outline also points out: "The heroic Chinese people waged a long-term war of resistance against the Japanese aggressors who invaded their country, and made great contributions to the defeat of imperialist Japan. In August 1945, the Soviet armed forces inflicted a devastating blow on the elite troops of imperialist Japan assembled in Northeast China, fulfilling their internationalist obligations and forging an unbreakable fraternal alliance between the Soviet and Chinese peoples with blood." (p. 25)
　　The outline explains that in the large-scale military conflict with the fascist aggressive forces, "the victory was won by the Soviet social system and state system born of the Great October Socialist Revolution, and the world's most advanced socialist ideology. During the war years, it once again vividly demonstrated that the Soviet system is superior to the capitalist system." (Ibid.)
　　The Soviet people defeated fascist Germany, but the German occupiers inflicted incalculable losses on the Soviet Union. 1,710 cities and 70,000 villages were destroyed, 32,000 industrial enterprises were destroyed and burned down, steel plants accounting for about 60% of pre-war steel production and coal mines accounting for more than 60% of coal production were destroyed, 98,000 collective farms, 1,876 state farms, and 2,890 machine tractor stations were destroyed and looted. The total material loss caused by direct property damage alone amounted to 679 billion rubles. At that time, experts from capitalist countries estimated that it would take the Soviet Union 50 to 100 years to recover these economic losses. But "our socialist social system and state system, in the difficult war years, in organizing the military economy and mobilizing resources to win victory, brought into play its infinite potential, demonstrated its decisive superiority over capitalism, and similarly, in the postwar years, enabled our motherland to quickly heal the serious wounds brought about by the war, restore all sectors of the national economy, and confidently push them forward." (pp. 27-28)
　　Under the leadership of the Communist Party, relying on the superiority of the socialist system, the Soviet people not only restored the pre-war economic level in ten years instead of 50 to 100 years, but also increased industrial output by 2.5 times compared with before the war. In 1957, the total industrial output exceeded the 1913 level by 32 times, the production of means of production increased by 73 times compared with 1913, and the total output of machine manufacturing industry and metal processing industry increased by 200 times compared with 1913.
　　In the world's industrial production, the Soviet Union's share has increased from 2%-3% in 1917 to about one-fifth now. The total industrial output of the Soviet Union ranks first in Europe and second in the world.
　　It is precisely because of such huge achievements in the industrial field that the Soviet Union built the world's first atomic power station in 1954, and this year launched the first intercontinental missile rocket and artificial earth satellite.
　　The outline also points out: "Due to the superiority of the socialist system, the Soviet Union is rapidly catching up with the most developed capitalist countries in terms of total output per capita. If, in 1913, our country's industrial output per capita was one-fourteenth to one-thirteenth of that of the United States, and in 1937 it was one-sixth and a half, then at present it is only one-two-sixth of that of the United States." (pp. 29-30)
　　Third, it talks about the current and future communist construction. The Soviet Union has already built socialism, but "socialism is the first stage of communist society, and building a communist society is the ultimate goal of the struggle of the working class and all working people" (p. 33).
　　The outline points out, "The productive forces and labor productivity of socialism have not yet reached the height that can create abundant material wealth and thus enable society to implement the principles of communism. There is still a certain contradiction between the growing needs of the people and the current possibilities of meeting these needs. This contradiction will be solved now and in the future by constantly developing and expanding the communist material and technical base." (p. 33)
　　In order to further improve the economy, the Soviet people are constantly launching socialist competitions, "because competition is a reliable guarantee for our motherland to achieve new achievements on the road to victoriously moving towards communism." (p. 34)
　　Now the Soviet people are struggling to solve the main tasks of the economy in accordance with the policy of the 20th Congress of the CPSU to catch up with and surpass the most developed capitalist countries in terms of output per capita. Reforming the management system in industry and construction, and expanding the reclamation of virgin land and fallow land in agriculture. In order to welcome the bright tomorrow of mankind—communist society, we are actively increasing the output of industry and agriculture by improving labor productivity. In the Sixth Five-Year Plan, industrial labor productivity will be increased by at least 50%, production costs will be reduced by 17%, the actual wages of workers and staff will be increased by 30%, the income of collective farmers will be increased by 40%, the working hours of workers and staff will be reduced to seven hours per day, and the housing shortage will be ended in the next 10-12 years. Conduct national discussions on all major issues in domestic major political, economic, and cultural life to further develop the true democracy under the social system, so that the people become conscious and active creators of a new life; carry out criticism and self-criticism, expose the shortcomings in socialist social life, accelerate the progress of socialist society, and gradually move towards communism, so that people "can get everything possible to fully develop their physical and intellectual abilities. By that time, the important difference between mental and physical labor and the important difference between urban and rural areas will be eliminated. Everyone will do their best, and everyone will get what they need, and labor will give people happiness" (pp. 39-40).
　　Fourth, it talks about the impact of the October Revolution on the fate of all mankind. The outline points out that the October Revolution is not only the greatest change in the lives of all nationalities in the Soviet Union, but it has also had a decisive impact on the entire course of world history and on the historical destiny of all mankind. "The great Chinese people and the working people of many countries in Asia and Europe have also embarked on the road opened up by the October Revolution. The victory of the socialist revolution in China and other people's democratic countries is the most important event in world history since the October Revolution of 1917. Before World War II, the territory of the socialist system accounted for 17% of the world, the population accounted for about 9% of the world, and the industrial output accounted for about one-tenth of the world; now the territory of the socialist countries has accounted for 26% of the world, the population accounts for about 35% of the world, and the industrial output accounts for about one-third of the world." (p. 52) In capitalist countries, most organized workers support the Communist Party. In 1917, on the eve of the October Revolution, there were less than 250,000 communists in Russia, and only a small number of groups close to the Communist Party in other countries; now, the ranks of communist parties in various countries have exceeded 33 million. This shows that the communist movement has greatly developed.
　　The great October Socialist Revolution encouraged the people of colonies and dependent countries to carry out liberation struggles, causing a profound crisis in the imperialist colonial system, and opening up a historical period for the people of Asia and Africa to gain liberation, for the people of Eastern countries to establish independent and autonomous countries, and to realize national rejuvenation. "The most vivid manifestation of the collapse of the colonial system is that the great Chinese people defeated imperialism and domestic feudal reactionary forces and established the People's Republic of China. More than 1.3 billion people, that is, half of the world's population, have broken away from their colonial subordinate status and established independent great powers... The nations of the East have been revived, independently and autonomously deciding their own destiny and actively participating in the cause of solving the fate of all mankind." (p. 57)
　　Fifth, the outline summarizes the historical experience of socialist revolution and socialist construction, and points out that the victory of socialist revolution and the establishment of a new socialist society in various countries have common characteristics and regularity: "The working class seizes power, establishes the dictatorship of the proletariat, and implements democracy for the working people under the leadership of the Marxist-Leninist party; the working class forms an alliance with the basic masses of peasants and all other working strata; eradicates national oppression and establishes equal and friendly relations among all nationalities; abolishes capitalist ownership and establishes socialist public ownership of basic means of production; plans to develop industry and the entire economy in order to build socialism and communism and improve the living standards of the working people; carries out gradual socialist transformation of agriculture; consolidates and strengthens the socialist state, develops socialist democracy, and protects the achievements of socialism from infringement by domestic and foreign class enemies; the working class of one country unites with the working class of other countries fighting for the victory of socialist and communist ideas, that is, implements proletarian internationalism." (pp. 53-54)
　　These are the common characteristics pointed out by the historical experience of socialist revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat. "As for the methods by which the working class seizes power, the methods and speed of socialist transformation, and the forms of the dictatorship of the proletariat, all this will have its own characteristics according to the specific conditions of each country's development." (p. 54)
　　At the same time, the outline also severely criticizes "national socialism" that only emphasizes the characteristics of its own nation: "Marxism-Leninism believes that the road taken by each country has its own characteristics, but this does not rule out that socialist revolution, socialist and communist construction have certain common fundamental characteristics and regularity. Some people emphasize the national characteristics of each country on the road to socialism, but forget the common fundamental principles of socialist revolution; their views are fundamentally incompatible with Marxism-Leninism" (p. 54).
　　The 40th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution is a glorious festival for all nationalities in the Soviet Union, all socialist countries, the entire international working class, and the working people of the world. In order to commemorate this great festival, deeply studying the world historical significance of the October Revolution, the historical impact on the fate of all mankind, as well as the path of heroic struggle experienced by all nationalities in the Soviet Union under the leadership of the Communist Party for 40 years and the steps of future communist construction, is extremely educational and meaningful for the Chinese people who are building socialism.

    十月革命四十周年的重要文献
    姜椿芳
    苏共中央宣传鼓动部和苏共中央马克思列宁主义研究院共同拟定的“伟大的十月社会主义革命四十周年”的宣传提纲，是总结十月革命和四十年来苏联社会主义建设经验的重要文献。全部提纲除导言外，分七章二十七节，用极其简练扼要的字句深刻地叙述了十月社会主义革命的胜利和苏联无产阶级专政的建立，社会主义社会的建成，卫国战争的胜利和战后共产主义建设的总结，以及苏联人民今后建设的任务。提纲从理论和实践上论证了马克思列宁主义关于社会主义革命和社会主义建设的原理，详细地阐述了共产党在苏联人民的光辉胜利中所起的领导作用，十月革命对各国人民所产生的巨大影响。
    从整个来看，提纲着重说明了五个问题，第一是关于党的作用。提纲指出，伟大的十月社会主义革命的胜利和苏联建设社会主义共产主义的成功有力地说明：“工人阶级的先锋队——共产党的领导作用是工人阶级完成它的世界历史使命——推翻资本主义和建立新的共产主义社会的决定性的条件。”（人民出版社版“提纲”第40页）“如果没有这样一个由列宁创立和教育出来的伟大的党，俄国的工农就不可能摧毁沙皇制度、推翻俄国资本主义、取得和保持苏维埃政权——工人阶级专政，就不可能打退国内反革命和外国武装干涉者、帝国主义侵略者的极其猛烈的进攻。”
  （同上）
    共产党是真正人民的党，它经常不断地联系人民群众，关心人民的疾苦和福利，不仅教导群众，也向群众学习，因而群众十分爱戴自己的党，响应党的号召，执行党所交给的任务。十月革命时俄国党只有二十四万勇敢的革命者，现已发展成为八百万党员和预备党员的强大政治队伍。这一强大的队伍把千百万工人、农民和知识分子创造性的劳动汇成一股洪流，引向共同的伟大目标。党成为人民一切创造活动的灵魂，是共产主义社会的伟大建筑师。
    共产党反对修正主义和教条主义，善于创造性地运用马克思列宁主义来解决当前的任务，因此共产党成为“我们时代的智慧、荣誉和良心”（列宁），我们时代伟大真理的体现者和传布者，一切胜利的领导者和组织者。
    第二，提纲用最雄辩的事实证明了社会主义制度的优越性。苏联——世界上第一个社会主义国家四十年来屹立不动这一事实，首先有力地说明了社会主义制度无比的优越性。十月革命胜利后所宣布的三项重大决定——和平法令、土地法令和成立工农政府，奠定了第一个工人国家的社会制度和国家制度的基础。这一制度体现了人民的愿望，因而得到了劳动人民真诚的拥护和爱戴。因为“和平法令打开了用革命方法摆脱战争的道路，奠定了苏维埃国家和平的对外政策的不可动摇的基础。土地法令体现了千百万农民世世代代的愿望——消灭地主土地所有制。代表大会关于成立工农政府的决议奠定了新的苏维埃国家的基础。”（9页）
    在工农联盟基础上建立起来的新的革命政权是无产阶级专政。无产阶级专政也就是无产阶级民主，“无产阶级民主制镇压资产阶级剥削者，——因此它不骗人，不许诺他们以自由和民主，——而给劳动者以真正的民主。”（列宁）
    有了这种以无产阶级专政为国家形式的工农政权，即真正代表劳动人民切身利益的社会制度和国家制度，永远消灭了民族不平等，造成了各民族真正兄弟般的团结，就具有远胜于全世界历史上任何阶级的任何国家制度的优越性。
    当俄国的工人和农民在共产党领导下开始和平建设的时候，被推翻的剥削阶级发动了反对工农政权的内战，以英、美、法的统治集团为首的国际帝国主义者，即所谓十四国联军，组织了反对苏维埃共和国的进军，企图把年轻的工农国家扼杀“在摇篮中”。共产党和苏维埃政府号召人民进行正义的革命的卫国战争来反对外国干涉者和国内的反革命。在极端困难的条件下，俄国工农经过三年的艰苦战斗，终于战胜了力量远胜于自己的敌人，第一次向全世界显示了社会主义制度的优越性。
    社会主义制度的优越性，接着又显示在为建设社会主义准备必要条件的恢复国家经济的工作上。
    提纲列举数字，说明外国武装干涉者使苏联国民经济带来严重的损害，使本来就落后的经济倒退了几十年。“1920年，我国大工业生产的产品大约只占1913年的七分之一。生铁产量只占战前2.7％，水泥产量只占战前2.4％，肥皂产量只占战前7.1％，棉织品产量只占战前4％。当时钢的产量下降到年产二十万吨。”（15页）“苏联人民仅仅依靠自己，依靠自己的力量和资金，在短时期内就克服了经济衰落和财力枯竭的空前困难，战胜了贫穷和饥荒，铺平了走向社会主义的道路。”（同上）
    头几个五年计划的完成，使苏维埃国家从农业国变成了工业国，这就更加显示了社会主义经济体系的优越性和它的伟大的生命力。而且正就是在这个时候，整个资本主义世界经历了深重的经济危机，工业生产缩减了44％，仅仅美国就在产品方面损失了三千亿元。而苏联人民依照列宁所制定的社会主义建设纲领，在国家工业化、农业集体化和文化革命方面取得了辉煌的成就。
    1941年，当苏联已经建成社会主义的时候，帝国主义法西斯德国利用了几乎整个被占领的欧洲的军事潜力发动了背信弃义的进攻，打断了苏联的和平建设，给苏联人民带来了无数灾难。“但同时它又证实：在苏联建立的新的社会主义制度是巩固的和不可战胜的，由社会主义产生的、由共产党教育出来的新人的精神力量是不可摧毁的。”（21页）
    提纲用“苏联人民在伟大卫国战争中的丰功伟绩”整整一章，分析了第二次世界大战的性质，叙述了美国和英国在这次战争中前后所采取的政策，说明苏联人民怎样在“一切为了前线，一切为了胜利”的口号下经过四年的浴血战斗，立下了空前的功绩，战胜了法西斯德国，解放了东南欧好几个被占领的国家。提纲并且指出：“英勇的中国人民对侵入本国领土的日本侵略者进行了多年的抗战，对于战胜帝国主义日本作出了巨大的贡献。1945年8月，苏联武装力量给了帝国主义日本集结在中国东北的精锐部队以歼灭性的打击，履行了自己的国际主义的义务，用鲜血结成了苏中两国人民牢不可破的兄弟同盟。”（25页）
    提纲说明，在同法西斯侵略势力的大规模军事冲突中，“取得了胜利的是伟大的十月社会主义革命诞生的苏维埃社会制度和国家制度，是世界上最先进的社会主义意识形态。在战争的年代里，又一次鲜明地体现出苏维埃制度比资本主义制度优越。”（同上）
    苏联人民战胜了法西斯德国，但德国占领者使苏联蒙受了不可胜计的损失。一千七百一十个城市和七万个村庄被破坏，三万二千个工业企业被破坏和焚毁，占战前钢产量60％左右的炼钢厂、占煤产量60％以上的煤矿被毁坏，九万八千个集体农庄、一千八百七十六个国营农场、二千八百九十个机器拖拉机站被摧毁和抢劫，仅仅由于直接破坏财物所造成的总的物质损失就达六千七百九十亿卢布。当时资本主义国家的专家估计，苏联要用五十年到一百年的时间才能恢复这些经济的损失。但是“我国社会主义社会制度和国家制度，在艰难的战争年代，在组织军事经济和动员资源争取胜利方面，发挥了它的无穷的潜力，显示了它对资本主义的决定的优越性，同样地，在战后年代，使我们祖国能够迅速地治愈战争带来的严重创伤，恢复国民经济的一切部门并满怀信心地推动它们前进。”
  （27—28页）
    苏联人民在共产党领导下，依靠社会主义制度的优越性，不是在五十年到一百年中，而是在十年中，不仅恢复了战前的经济水平，而且比战前的工业产量增加了二点五倍。1957年工业总产量超过1913年水平三十二倍，生产资料的生产比1913年增加七十三倍，机器制造工业和金属加工工业总产量比1913年增加二百倍。
    在全世界的工业生产中，苏联的比重已从1917年的2％—3％增加到现在的五分之一左右了。苏联工业总产量已占欧洲第一位，世界第二位。
    也正是在工业方面有了这样巨大的成就，所以使苏联从1954年起就建成了世界上第一座原子能发电站，今年就第一个放射了洲际导弹火箭和人造地球卫星。
    提纲又指出：“由于社会主义制度的优越性，苏联在按人口计算的生产总量方面正在迅速地赶上最发达的资本主义国家。如果说，1913年我国工业产量按人口计算，为美国的十四分之一到十三分之一，1937年为六点五分之一，那末，现时仅为美国的二点六分之一了。”（29—30页）
    第三是讲述现在和今后的共产主义建设。苏联已经建成了社会主义，但“社会主义是共产主义社会的第一阶段，建成共产主义社会是工人阶级和全体劳动人民奋斗的最终目的”（33页）。
    提纲指出，“社会主义的生产力和劳动生产率还没有达到能创造丰富的物质财富因而使社会可以实行共产主义原则的高度。在人民日益增长的需要和现时所能满足这种需要的可能性之间，还存在着一定的矛盾。这种矛盾现在和将来要通过不断发展和扩大共产主义物质技术基础的途径来解决。”（33页）
    为了进一步提高经济，苏联人民经常展开社会主义竞赛，“因为竞赛是我们祖国在胜利地走向共产主义的道路上取得新的成就的可靠保证。”（34页）
    现在苏联人民正根据苏共二十次代表大会所指示的在按照人口计算的产量方面赶上并超过最发达的资本主义国家的方针，为解决经济的主要任务而斗争。在工业和建筑业方面改革管理制度，在农业方面扩大开垦生荒地和熟荒地。为了迎接人类光辉的明天——共产主义社会，正积极用提高劳动生产率来增加工业和农业的产量。在第六个五年计划中，工业劳动生产率至少要提高50％，生产成本降低17％，工人职员实际工资提高30％，集体农民收入提高40％，工人职员工作时间每天减为七小时，在最近10—12年内结束房荒现象。对于国内一切重大的政治、经济、文化生活中的重大问题，展开全民性的讨论，以更进一步发挥社会制度下的真正民主，使人民群众成为新生活的自觉的、积极的创造者；开展批评和自我批评，揭发社会主义社会生活中的缺点，加速社会主义社会的前进，逐步走向共产主义，使人们“得到一切可能来全面发展自己的体力和智力。那时脑力劳动和体力劳动之间的重要差别、城市和乡村之间的重要差别都将消除。每个人都将各尽所能，各取所需，而劳动将给人以快乐”（39—40页）。
    第四，讲到十月革命对于全体人类命运的影响。提纲指出，十月革命不仅是苏联各族人民生活中的最伟大的变革，它对世界历史的整个进程，对全人类的历史命运也起了决定性的影响。“伟大的中国人民和欧亚两洲许多国家的劳动人民也走上了十月革命所开辟的道路。社会主义革命在中国和其他人民民主国家的胜利是1917年十月革命以后的世界历史上最重要的事件。在第二次世界大战以前，社会主义体系的领土占全世界的17％，人口约占全世界的9％，工业产量约占全世界的十分之一；现在各社会主义国家的领土则已占全世界的26％，人口约占全世界的35％，工业产量约占全世界的三分之一。”（52页）在资本主义国家里，大多数有组织的工人都拥护共产党。1917年，在十月革命前夕，俄国的共产党员才不到二十五万人，其他国家只有人数不多的靠近共产党的小组；而现在，各国共产党的队伍已经超过三千三百万了。这说明共产主义运动已经有了很大的发展。
    伟大的十月社会主义革命鼓舞殖民地和附属国的人民去进行解放斗争，使帝国主义殖民体系开始发生深刻的危机，开辟了亚非人民获得解放、东方各国人民建立独立自主的国家和实现民族复兴的历史时期。“殖民制度崩溃的最鲜明的表现是伟大的中国人民战胜了帝国主义和国内的封建反动势力，建立了中华人民共和国。十三亿以上的人口，即世界人口的一半，摆脱了殖民地的附属地位，建立了独立的大国……东方各民族复兴起来，独立自主地决定自己的命运，积极地参与解决全人类命运的事业。”（57页）
    第五，提纲总结了社会主义革命和社会主义建设的历史经验，指出各国社会主义革命胜利和新的社会主义社会建立有共同的特点和规律性：“工人阶级取得政权，建立无产阶级专政，对于在马克思列宁主义政党领导下的劳动人民实行民主；工人阶级同基本农民群众及其他一切劳动阶层结成联盟；铲除民族压迫，建立各族人民的平等友好关系；废除资本主义所有制，建立基本生产资料的社会主义公有制；有计划地发展工业和整个经济，借以建成社会主义和共产主义，提高劳动人民的生活水平；对农业实行逐步的社会主义改造；巩固和健全社会主义国家，发展社会主义民主，保卫社会主义的成果不受国内外阶级敌人的侵害；一国的工人阶级同其他国家为社会主义和共产主义思想的胜利而奋斗的工人阶级团结一致，即实行无产阶级的国际主义。”（53—54页）
    这是社会主义革命和无产阶级专政历史经验所指出的共同特点，“至于工人阶级夺取政权的方法，社会主义改造的方式和速度，以及无产阶级专政的形式，这一切一定会根据各国发展的具体条件而具有自己的特点。”（54页）
    同时提纲也严厉地批评了只强调自己民族特点的“民族社会主义”：“马克思列宁主义认为，每个国家走的道路有它的特点，但是这并不排斥社会主义革命、社会主义和共产主义的建设具有某些共同的根本特征和规律性。一些人强调每一个走向社会主义的国家的民族特点，而忘记了社会主义革命的共同的根本原则；他们的观点是同马克思列宁主义根本不相容的”（54页）。
    伟大的十月社会主义革命的四十周年，是苏联各族人民、各社会主义国家、整个国际工人阶级、全世界劳动人民的光辉节日。为了纪念这个伟大的节日，深入地学习一下十月革命的世界历史意义、对整个人类命运的历史影响，以及四十年来苏联各族人民在共产党领导下所经历的英勇斗争的道路和今后共产主义建设的步骤，对于我们正在建设着社会主义的中国人民，是极有教益极有意义的。
    提纲里援引毛主席的话说：“我们中国人民正是沿着十月社会主义革命的道路取得今天的胜利和成就的。中国人民一贯把中国革命看作是伟大的十月社会主义革命的继续，并且以此为莫大的光荣。”刘少奇同志在最近苏联尤金大使欢迎以阿里斯托夫同志为首的苏联最高苏维埃代表团的宴会上也说：中国人民认识到，中国革命的胜利和社会主义建设的成就，是沿着伟大十月社会主义革命的道路取得的，今后我们还要继续认真地学习苏联的各种先进经验和科学技术，以便尽可能迅速地把我国建设成为一个繁荣富强的伟大的社会主义国家。苏共中央宣传鼓动部和马克思列宁主义研究院共同拟定的宣传提纲，正是帮助我们学习苏联四十年斗争和建设经验的最全面最深刻的文件。
