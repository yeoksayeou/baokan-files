Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 16th. Soviet violinist David Oistrakh held a recital at the Da Guangming Cinema in Shanghai on the evening of the 15th. He performed five pieces for an audience of over 2,100. Oistrakh's superb technique revealed the ideological content of the musical works truthfully and profoundly. His performance of Bach's "Concerto in A Minor," a German classical composer, was magnificent in style, and this work from more than two hundred years ago gained new life through his vivid performance. Chausson's "Poème," a relatively difficult work to perform, was presented for the first time in China; Oistrakh successfully conveyed the composer's sorrowful and melancholic emotions to the audience.

　　奥伊斯特拉赫在上海首次演奏
    据新华社上海16日电　苏联小提琴家奥伊斯特拉赫，15日晚在上海大光明电影院举行独奏会。他向二千一百多听众演奏了五个乐曲。奥伊斯特拉赫精湛的技巧，真实而深刻地揭示音乐作品的思想内容。他演奏的德国古典作曲家巴赫的“A小调协奏曲”，气派雄伟，这个两百多年前的作品通过他生动的演奏，获得了新的生命。法国作曲家萧松的“诗曲”，是一首较难表现的作品，在中国这还是首次演出；奥伊斯特拉赫成功地把作曲家悲痛、忧郁的感情传达给听众。
