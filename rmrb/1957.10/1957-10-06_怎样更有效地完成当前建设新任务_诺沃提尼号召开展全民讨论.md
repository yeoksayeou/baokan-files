Xinhua News Agency, Prague, October 5th. Novotny, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, stated in his main report at the recent CCP Central Committee Plenary Session that the basic task of this plenary session is to prepare for a nationwide discussion on the implementation of the resolutions of the Party's National Congress and the new tasks of socialist construction.

    He said, "We have decided to do this, first of all, because we hope to more broadly discuss the future tasks arising from the Second Five-Year Plan (1956-1960), and to expose the shortcomings that hinder our faster and smoother progress."

    Novotny said that the 11th Congress of the CCP will be held in the first half of next year, and this congress will determine the Party's future line. Therefore, the upcoming nationwide discussion will be of greater political significance.

    Novotny spoke about the achievements Czechoslovakia has made in the year and a half since the CCP National Congress. He pointed out that the level of development already achieved in the national economy requires that the superiority of the socialist system be utilized in the best possible way in the organization of management work. Therefore, rigid centralization must be abolished, and the authority of local organs must be continuously expanded. However, seeking more effective management methods in the national economy does not mean deviating from Lenin's principle of democratic centralism.

    Novotny pointed out that although our country's economic development has made achievements, the Party has never concealed the existing shortcomings. Therefore, in the discussion process, it is necessary to more broadly discuss issues such as saving raw materials, improving the quality of industrial products, completing the plans of machine-building enterprises, and improving the work of transportation, construction organizations, and trade enterprises.

    Novotny also spoke about the achievements in agriculture. He said that from January 1st to September 15th this year, 2,564 new unified agricultural cooperatives were established nationwide. As of September 15th, there were a total of 10,736 unified agricultural cooperatives nationwide. In this way, the socialist component already owns 60% of all arable land. In the first half of this year, the small commodity production method still dominated agriculture. He said that the socialist component in the countryside is growing and consolidating every day. Therefore, we can expect that the Party Congress's instructions on agricultural cooperativization and increasing agricultural production must be completed.

    When talking about measures to further improve the living standards of the working people, he pointed out that the most recent reduction in retail prices has brought residents benefits of approximately 1.8 billion crowns (Czech currency). The wages of some workers have increased by a total of 720 million crowns in one year. In the first half of this year, resident welfare benefits increased by more than 700 million crowns compared to the same period last year.

    Novotny also spoke about strengthening the work of national front organizations at all levels and mass organizations.

    Novotny concluded by saying that our Party has always faced the people when deciding on major issues, frankly explaining the situation to them, and listening to their opinions and suggestions. This has been particularly evident since the 20th Congress of the CPSU. We not only welcome the resolutions of the 20th Congress, but also drew conclusions for our work based on these resolutions. We resolutely oppose revisionism, because it is the main danger hindering the unity of the international revolutionary movement. We have been systematically overcoming manifestations of dogmatism; our entire practice is to strive to support the new creativity in our society that uses revolutionary theory to creatively solve the problems of socialist construction.

    怎样更有效地完成当前建设新任务
    诺沃提尼号召开展全民讨论
    新华社布拉格5日电　捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会第一书记诺沃提尼在最近举行的捷共中央全会上做主要报告时说，这次全会的基本任务就是，为就党的全国代表会议决议的执行情况和社会主义建设新任务问题展开全民讨论进行准备。
    他说，我们决定这样做，首先是由于希望更广泛地讨论第二个五年计划（1956—1960年）所产生的今后的任务，和希望揭露阻碍我们更加迅速、更加顺利前进的缺点。
    诺沃提尼说，明年上半年将召开捷共第十一次代表大会，这次大会将确定党今后的路线。因此，即将展开的全民讨论的政治意义就更加重大。
    诺沃提尼谈到了在举行捷共全国代表会议后的一年半中捷克斯洛伐克所取得的成就。他指出，国民经济方面已经达到的发展水平，要求在管理工作的组织方面以尽可能好的方法利用社会主义制度的优越性。因此，死板的集中制必须取消，地方机关的权限必须不断扩大。不过，在国民经济方面寻求更有效的管理方法决不意味着脱离列宁的民主集中制原则。
    诺沃提尼指出，虽然我国经济发展取得了成就，但是，党从来没隐瞒过存在的缺点。因此，在讨论过程中，必须更广泛地讨论像节约原材料、提高工业品的质量、完成机器制造企业的计划、改进运输业、建筑机构、贸易企业工作等这样一些问题。
    诺沃提尼还谈到了农业方面的成就，他说，在今年1月1日到9月15日期间，全国新成立了二千五百六十四个统一农业合作社。截至9月15日，全国总共有一万零七百三十六个统一农业合作社。这样一来，社会主义成分已经拥有全部可耕土地的60％。而在今年上半年小商品生产方式还在农业中占优势。他说，目前农村中社会主义成分每天都在增长和巩固。因此我们能够指望，党代表会议关于农业合作化和提高农业生产的指示必定要完成。
    在谈到进一步提高劳动人民生活水平的措施时，他指出，最近一次降低零售价格给居民带来了约十八亿克朗（捷币）的利益。一部分劳动者的工资在一年中总共提高了七亿二千万克朗。今年上半年居民的优抚金比去年同期增加了七亿多克朗。
    诺沃提尼还谈到了加强民族阵线各级组织以及群众团体的工作的问题。
    诺沃提尼最后说，我们党在决定重大问题时，从来都是面向人民，坦率地向他们说明情况，听取他们的意见和建议的。这特别表现在苏共第二十次代表大会以后。我们不仅欢迎第二十次代表大会的决议，而且根据这些决议为我们的工作做出了结论。我们坚决反对修正主义，因为它是妨害国际革命运动团结一致的主要危险。我们一直在有系统地克服教条主义的表现；我们的全部实践就是努力支持我们社会中把革命理论用来创造性地解决社会主义建设问题的新的创造精神。
