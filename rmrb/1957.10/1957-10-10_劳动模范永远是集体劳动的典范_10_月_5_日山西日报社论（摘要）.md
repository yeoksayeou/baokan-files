Labor Models are Always Models of Collective Labor
—October 5th, Shanxi Daily Editorial (Summary)

Wu Houlie is a well-known agricultural labor model in Shanxi Province. He is the director of the Hongxing Agriculture, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative in Yangjingdi Village, Pingshun County. Since he started running the cooperative in 1952, he has consistently participated in production labor despite the increasing workload of the cooperative. Moreover, he has worked no less than 140 labor days each year. This matter deserves attention, and we would like to discuss the issue of labor models participating in production labor.

Labor models are the most honorable individuals in our new society, and they come from the front lines of production labor. Therefore, for every labor model, participating in production labor is their duty. Comrade Wu Houlie said it well: "If a labor model does not participate in labor, what kind of labor model are they?"

After the realization of agricultural collectivization, the economic and political status of labor models has undergone fundamental changes. Like all farmers, they have become collective farmers completely dependent on the cooperative economy. Furthermore, the vast majority of them are also responsible for leading this collective economic organization. That is to say, on the one hand, they are still manual laborers, and on the other hand, they also engage in some mental labor. This new change places new demands on labor models, requiring them not only to continue to play a exemplary role in collective labor, but also to lead the cooperative well and excellently complete the cooperative management work entrusted to them by the members. It should be acknowledged that the management work undertaken by these labor models in collective economic organizations is more arduous and the responsibility is greater than in the past when they led mutual aid teams or elementary cooperatives. In this situation, how to correctly treat mental and physical labor, how to properly arrange these two types of labor, and how to closely integrate them has become a new problem faced by every labor model. We believe that Comrade Wu Houlie has solved this new problem relatively well, so the masses praise him as: "He takes the lead in work and is a model in labor."

In the minds of some labor models, there is such an idea: Now that I am a leader in the cooperative, I attend meetings, and I am a well-known figure in the county, the province, and even the whole country. If I participate in physical labor again, wouldn't that be the same as ordinary members, and wouldn't it be a bit undignified? This exposes two aspects of ideological problems: On the one hand, they regard mental labor and physical labor as having a distinction between nobility and baseness, and thus look down on physical labor; on the other hand, they place themselves above the members, and everywhere they feel they should be superior. This kind of thought of despising physical labor and being superior is a reflection of the remnants of feudal ideology, which should be resolutely abandoned by the labor models of our socialist society. Everyone knows that in socialist society, engaging in mental labor and physical labor is equally glorious, and those engaged in mental labor, in a fundamental sense, are serving manual laborers. Because the source of power for social life development lies in engaging in production labor, without production labor, there is nothing. Therefore, at any time, manual laborers (i.e., workers and farmers) are always the main body of society. Precisely because of this, participating in production labor is the most glorious, and separating from production labor is the most shameful, which has become a new fashion in our country. Not only agricultural cooperative cadres should participate in production labor, but also leading cadres of party and state organs should participate in physical labor. How can it be said that there is a distinction between nobility and baseness between mental labor and physical labor? And how can we not treat ourselves as equal to the members in the matter of participating in physical labor, but draw a line of demarcation? This kind of ideological understanding is incompatible with the glorious title of labor model.

As early as 1945, at the meeting of labor heroes and model workers in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, Chairman Mao pointed out that labor models have three roles, namely, leading role, backbone role, and bridge role. How can labor models play these three major roles well? Is it possible to play these three major roles by separating from production labor? Facts have proved that it is not possible. The so-called leading role, as Chairman Mao said, is that "your work has become a model for ordinary people, raised the work standard, and inspired everyone to learn from you." This means that in addition to excellently completing the cooperative management work they are responsible for, labor models should also walk ahead of the members in terms of participating in production labor, and always become the model of collective labor within the cooperative. Of course, compared with the members, we should not only look at how many labor days have been completed, but also look at the attitude of socialist labor. However, how many labor days can be completed within a year should be planned realistically, just like the members, and strive to complete it. The so-called backbone role, as Chairman Mao said, is to become the "backbone in the masses" and the "core in the masses" to promote work. However, separating from production labor, sitting in the office all day "working," rarely contacting the members, and not understanding each other, will gradually separate from the members, increase the gap in emotions with the members, and gradually lose the trust of the members. How can they continue to be the core in the masses and how can they stand among the masses and play a promoting role? The so-called bridge role, as Chairman Mao said, is to transmit the opinions of the masses upwards and transmit the opinions from above downwards. However, separating from production labor means separating from the reality of production. It is difficult to understand and fully understand the inner opinions and demands of the members in a timely manner, and even if you hear them, you will not deeply understand them, so you cannot transmit them well. Similarly, if you cannot transmit the opinions of the masses well, when transmitting the opinions from above downwards, you will be divorced from reality, not easily accepted by the masses, and even become a formality, which is difficult to achieve. In short, persisting in participating in production labor with the members, living closely and regularly with the members, and playing a exemplary role in production labor, understanding production and understanding the members through participation in production, and guiding production and promoting the members, are the prerequisites for labor models to fully play their three major roles. If you separate from production labor, it is like a fish leaving water, and there is nothing to rely on to play the three major roles.

    劳动模范永远是集体劳动的典范
    ——10月5日山西日报社论（摘要）
    武侯梨是山西省知名的农业劳动模范，他是平顺县羊井底村红星农林牧生产合作社的主任。他从1952年办合作社起，至今六年时间，社务工作虽然日益繁重，但他一直坚持参加生产劳动，并且，每年参加生产劳动的时间，都不少于一百四十个劳动日。这件事很值得重视，我们愿意就此谈谈劳动模范参加生产劳动的问题。
    劳动模范是我们新社会中最高尚的一种荣誉，劳动模范来自生产劳动战线。因此，对于每一个劳动模范来说，参加生产劳动乃是他份内之事。武侯梨同志说得好：“一个劳动模范如果不参加劳动，还算什么劳动模范。”
    在实现农业合作化以后，劳动模范的经济地位和政治地位有了根本的改变，他们和全体农民一样，已经成为完全依附合作经济生活的集体农民，并且，其中的绝大多数人，又担负了这个集体经济组织的领导工作。这就是说，他们一方面还是体力劳动者，另一方面又从事一些脑力劳动的工作。这种新的变化，就对劳动模范提出了新的要求，不仅要在集体劳动当中继续发挥模范作用，还必须领导办好合作社，出色地完成社员群众所交付给他们的社务管理工作。应当承认，这些劳动模范在集体经济组织中所担负的管理工作，较之于过去领导互助组或初级社，任务是更加繁重了，责任是更加重大了。在这种情况下，如何正确地对待脑力劳动和体力劳动，如何妥善地安排这两种劳动，并使之紧密结合起来，就成为每个劳动模范所面临的新问题。我们认为，武侯梨同志正是由于较好地解决了这个新问题，所以群众誉之为：“工作带头干，劳动是模范”。
    在有些劳动模范的思想上，有这样一种想法：我现在已经是社里的领导人啦，会上来会上去，又是全县或全省以至全国的知名人物，再参加体力劳动，岂不是和普通社员一样，未免有点不大体面吧？这里暴露了两方面的思想问题：一方面他们将从事脑力劳动和体力劳动，看作有贵贱之分，因而下看体力劳动；另一方面他们把自己摆在社员之上，处处觉得应该高人一等。这种鄙视体力劳动和高人一等的思想，是封建思想残余的反映，是我们社会主义社会的劳动模范所应该坚决唾弃的。大家都知道，在社会主义社会里，从事脑力劳动和体力劳动本是同样光荣，而从事脑力劳动的人，从根本意义上说，又是为体力劳动者服务的。因为，社会生活发展的源泉力量，在于进行生产劳动，没有生产劳动，就没有一切。所以，在任何时候，体力劳动者（即工人、农民）总是社会的主体。正因为这样，参加生产劳动最光荣，脱离生产劳动最可耻，成了我们国家的一种新的风尚。不仅农业社干部要参加生产劳动，而且党和国家机关的领导干部也要参加体力劳动。这怎么能说从事脑力劳动和体力劳动有贵贱之分？又怎么能够在参加体力劳动这件事上，把自己和社员不作同等看待，而要划出一条鸿沟呢？这种思想认识，是和劳动模范这个光荣称号不相容的。
    毛主席远在1945年陕甘宁边区劳动英雄和模范工作者会议上，曾经指出劳动模范有三个作用，这就是带头作用，骨干作用，桥梁作用。而劳动模范怎样才能很好地发挥这三大作用呢？难道脱离开生产劳动，能够发挥这三大作用吗？事实证明是不行的。所谓带头作用，如毛主席所说，就是“你们的工作成了一般人的模范，提高了工作标准，引起了大家向你们学习”。这就是说，劳动模范除了出色地完成所担负的社务工作之外，在参加生产劳动方面，也应该走在社员前面，永远成为社内集体劳动的典范。当然，和社员相比，不应该只看作了多少劳动日，而要看社会主义的劳动态度如何。但是，一年之内，能作多少劳动日，要和社员一样，进行切合实际的规划，并努力完成。所谓骨干作用，如毛主席所说，就是要成为“群众中的骨干”，“群众中的核心”，以推动工作。而脱离生产劳动，整天坐在办公室里“办公”，很少和社员接触，互不了解，就会逐渐脱离社员群众，在情感上和社员增加隔阂，逐渐失掉社员的信任，这样，怎能继续成为群众中的核心，怎能站在群众之中起推动作用呢？所谓桥梁作用，如毛主席所说，就是将群众的意见传上来，将上面的意见传下去。而脱离生产劳动，就要脱离生产实际，对于社员群众内心里的意见和要求，很难及时了解和完全了解，即使听到了，也体会不深，这样就不能很好传上去；同样，如果不能将群众意见很好传上去，在将上面意见传下去的时候，就会脱离实际，不易被群众所接受，以至流于形式，很难实现。总之，坚持和社员一起参加生产劳动，和社员密切的经常生活在一起，并在生产劳动中起模范作用，通过参加生产去了解生产、了解社员，并指导生产、推动社员，这是劳动模范充分发挥三大作用的前提条件。如果脱离开生产劳动，就如同鱼离开水一样，发挥三大作用就无所依托。
