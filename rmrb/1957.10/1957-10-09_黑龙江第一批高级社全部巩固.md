The production of these cooperatives has surpassed the highest level of wealthy middle peasants after several years of development. Each cooperative has an average of 120,000 yuan in public property, and 90% of the members have reached the living standards of middle peasants. Most members love the cooperative as their home, the cooperative and team have formed a leadership core, and they have relatively systematic experience in running the cooperative.

(Report from this newspaper) Heilongjiang Province recently investigated and summarized the experiences of nineteen advanced agricultural production cooperatives that were established on a trial basis between 1951 and 1955 in order to consolidate a large number of new cooperatives. These old cooperatives have now been consolidated. The history of development of these nineteen cooperatives proves that the estimate made by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao that it takes about five years or more to run a cooperative well is completely correct.

The basic situation of these old cooperatives now is: production has greatly developed, the yield per hectare in 1956 was 3,054 *jin* (catty, equivalent to half a kilogram), an increase of 34.4% compared to before the establishment of the cooperative, and about 10% higher than the provincial average yield in 1956; wasteland reclaimed for paddy and dry land accounts for 21.9% of the existing cultivated area; corresponding diversified economic production has developed, especially the unit area yield of crops has reached and exceeded the highest level of wealthy middle peasants. A socialist accumulation foundation has been established, with an average of about 124,000 yuan of public property per cooperative, more than two to three times that of general new cooperatives; it can basically meet the needs of the cooperative's production development, and basically achieve no internal or external debt. The income of cooperative members has increased year by year, and the material and cultural life of farmers has greatly improved. The average annual income per household was about 200 yuan during the individual farmer period, and now the average annual income per household is about 600 yuan. Before the establishment of the cooperative, poor cooperative members accounted for 35% of the total number of households, and now cooperative members who still have difficulties in life account for only 9.4% of the total number of cooperative members. Cooperative members whose living standards are equivalent to those of wealthy middle peasants in the past account for 31.6%, and cooperative members whose living standards are equivalent to those of general middle peasants account for 59%. The political and ideological outlook of farmers has undergone profound changes, and they have basically established the ideas of socialism, patriotism, and collectivism. Cooperative members who basically love the cooperative as their home account for 69.7%. The cooperative and team have formed a leadership core, with poor and lower-middle peasants occupying an absolute advantage. The production order and management system are relatively sound, and they have relatively systematic experience in running the cooperative.

Based on the experience of these old cooperatives, the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China now plans to consolidate all agricultural cooperatives in the province within five years or more from the time of their establishment.

According to the experience of the nineteen old cooperatives, in the work of consolidating cooperatives, attention should be paid to solving the following problems:

Concentrate efforts to increase yield per unit area and gradually develop diversified economic activities.

The continuous development of production and the continuous consolidation of the economic foundation of the nineteen old cooperatives are mainly due to the correct implementation of the management policy of concentrating efforts to increase the yield per unit area, gradually developing diversified economic activities, and saving funds and expanding reproduction. In order to implement the policy of increasing the yield per unit area, it is first necessary to overcome the idea of "it is difficult to harvest 10,000 *shi* of grain without planting thousands of *qing* of land" which emphasizes extensive cultivation with low yields. Some of the nineteen old cooperatives blindly expanded the cultivated area at the beginning, regardless of the conditions, resulting in high costs, large waste, and insignificant yield increases. After they accepted this lesson, they generally paid attention to reforming agricultural technology and concentrated their efforts on increasing the yield per unit area. In increasing the yield per unit area, they also adhered to the principle of "combining comprehensiveness and focus" in reforming agricultural technology. They not only paid attention to the comprehensiveness, continuity, and relevance of agricultural technology reform, but also grasped the key measures to increase yield per unit area according to the conditions of different regions, and implemented focused technological reforms. These nineteen old cooperatives have achieved remarkable achievements in cultivating and popularizing improved varieties, increasing the application of manure, improving soil fertility, preventing floods and draining waterlogging, transforming dry land into paddy fields, and cultivating carefully and meticulously. According to the experience of these old cooperatives, if Heilongjiang Province can truly grasp the above-mentioned yield-increasing measures and cooperate with comprehensive technological reforms, it is certain that it can achieve the goal of producing 400 *jin* of grain per *mu* as required in the National Agricultural Development Program (Draft) within the next ten years.

While paying attention to increasing the yield per unit area of grain, it is necessary to develop diversified economic activities accordingly. The development of diversified economic activities must adhere to the principle of taking agriculture as the main focus and serving agricultural production. First of all, diversified economic activities must be carried out on the condition that they do not affect agricultural production, that is, to gradually develop multi-sector production according to the degree of labor potential. This is especially important in Heilongjiang Province, where there is more land and less people and labor is insufficient. All of these old cooperatives that have done this have overcome and avoided the contradiction between agriculture and other production in terms of labor. Secondly, in the investment of diversified economic activities, there have also been two deviations: one is to rely solely on national loans; the other is to draw agricultural funds to engage in sideline occupations. Both of these affected the development of agriculture. Therefore, the production investment of diversified economic activities should mainly be determined according to the needs of agricultural development and the degree of capital accumulation. If there is a contradiction between agriculture and sideline occupations in investment, the needs of agriculture should be met first, so that diversified economic activities can be developed on a reliable basis. The experience of these old cooperatives also shows that multi-sector production must be managed profitably and gradually provide funds for agricultural production and construction. Therefore, investment in small-scale and quick-yielding projects should be made first, followed by investment in large-scale and profitable projects. Some cooperatives began to pay attention to spreading out, pursuing projects with large investments and large scales, thinking that the more sectors they operate, the greater the "superiority" of the cooperative. As a result, as the cooperative members summed it up, "there are many patterns, but not much income." Thirdly, multi-sector production must have corresponding technical forces. In order to master the necessary technologies, on the one hand, backbones can be selected and sent to state-owned farms and ranches to learn; on the other hand, the main method should be to take materials locally, cultivate locally, and improve locally. In addition, in order to do a good job in diversified economic activities, it is also necessary to strengthen the allocation of leading cadres. In the past, some cooperatives had placed some old, weak, disabled, and inexperienced people in livestock farms and brick kilns. The cooperative members described these places as "sanatoriums" and "nursing homes." Later, stronger cadres were sent in, and the work improved.

The production of agricultural cooperatives must rely on internal accumulation of funds for development. Agricultural loans are necessary, but under normal circumstances, development of production cannot rely on external support. In the past two years, this batch of old cooperatives has basically stopped applying for loans from the state, and they have proposed the goal of "no external debt, no internal debt" in terms of economy, and basic self-sufficiency in production. The main method to achieve this goal is to implement the policy of diligence and thrift in running the cooperative, and to establish a saving system in production and management. Many cooperatives have implemented cost accounting and adhered to the system of "spending less money and doing more things" and "graded management, personal responsibility, rewards for saving, and penalties for waste," which has greatly reduced expenditures.

Correctly distribute income, rationally adjust the relationship between accumulation and consumption, and implement the principle of distribution according to work.

Correctly distributing income is an important link in promoting the consolidation and development of cooperatives. Rationally adjusting the relationship between accumulation and consumption and implementing the principle of distribution according to work are the two basic aspects of distribution work.

From the historical development process of the old cooperatives, in handling the relationship between accumulation and consumption, it has gone through a tortuous process from "only caring about the cooperative and not caring about the state and the cooperative members" and "only caring about the cooperative members and not caring about the state and the cooperative" to "taking care of all three." From the perspective of the current large number of new cooperatives, the phenomenon of emphasizing consumption and neglecting accumulation still exists. Some cooperatives do not repay national loans, do not leave annual production expenses, do not repay the collectivized share funds remaining from cooperative members on time, and some even distribute the collectivized share funds handed over by cooperative members according to workdays to show so-called "superiority." This method of expanding consumption by "holding back the state and holding back the cooperative members" has fueled the individualism of cooperative members and affected the enthusiasm of some middle peasants. This phenomenon is caused on the one hand by the individualism and localism of some cooperatives, and on the other hand by the improper proportion of accumulation and consumption. Judging from the laws of distribution work of the old cooperatives over the years, the proportion between accumulation and consumption should be based on the three principles of making up for deficiencies in good years (accumulating more in good years and accumulating less or not at all in poor years), investing according to ability, managing profitably (production investment should basically match the normal accumulation rate), and in the use of funds, first ensuring the needs of production, and then carrying out basic construction according to ability.

The experience of the past few years has also shown that in handling the distribution of income among cooperative members, attention must also be paid to overcoming egalitarianism and implementing the principle of overall planning and appropriate arrangements. Egalitarianism in distribution work often manifests itself in three aspects: calculation of workdays, distribution of agricultural products, and arrangement of the economic life of cooperative members. According to the accumulated experience, only by constantly adjusting the quotas between light labor, heavy labor, high technology, and low technology can the principle of distribution according to work be gradually reflected. At the same time, on the other hand, it is necessary to pay attention to solving the contradiction between the quality and quantity of labor in the labor process. Some cooperatives distribute grain regardless of the number of workdays done, and distribute it according to the population and the "three fixed" grain retention standards, which has also aroused dissatisfaction among the majority of cooperative members and must be changed. Cooperatives that have done well insist on ensuring the necessary rations for all cooperative members, and also take care of the needs of those cooperative members who have earned more work points. Those who work well and earn more workdays can receive all the grain according to the "three fixed" grain retention standards, and those who earn less labor and cannot afford to receive all the grain will find other ways to solve it, and do not arbitrarily occupy other people's workdays. This method is not only welcomed by the majority of cooperative members, but also has great educational significance for a few who work poorly.

In order to increase the income of the vast majority of cooperative members, it is also necessary to consistently combine distribution work with the arrangement of cooperative members' labor force and economic life, make overall plans, take care of all aspects, so that people with different labor abilities can give full play to their strengths. In spring, the Tuanshanzi Cooperative in Ning'an County announced the cooperative's production, labor, and income plans for the whole year to all cooperative members, and mobilized all cooperative members to formulate household labor, income, and expenditure plans according to the cooperative's plans. Through household plans, the cooperative grasped the approximate situation of each household's annual income, and then made specific arrangements for each household in terms of participating in cooperative labor and household sideline occupations according to the different amounts of income of each household. After household planning, households with less income can increase income, and households with reduced income are greatly reduced, which can basically avoid the "triangular debt" between the cooperative, overspending households, and deficit households. For the surplus funds of deposit households, arrangements have also been made in terms of renovating houses, expanding production investment, and developing household sideline occupations.

Strengthen the Party's leadership over cooperatives and strengthen ideological and political work.

Strengthening the Party's leadership over cooperatives and strengthening ideological and political work are the fundamental keys to consolidating cooperatives. From the development process of the nineteen old cooperatives and a large number of new cooperatives, in order to strengthen the Party's leadership and strengthen ideological and political work, attention must be paid to the following fundamental issues:

First, it is necessary to promptly overcome the tendency to neglect the Party's leadership and ideological and political work. After the province's advanced cooperativization, some erroneous understandings were relatively common among grassroots party members, namely, that "most of the landlords and rich peasants have joined the cooperative, and there will be no more class struggle in the future," "the task of cooperativization has been completed, the struggle between the two roads has ended, and the task in the future is only production and construction, and the task of party members is only to take the lead in production," "farmers have become collective farmers, the advanced cooperative implements the system of distribution according to work, and cooperative members can actively work without education." Therefore, the Party's leadership and ideological and political work were once weakened. The branch secretary was weak, the party members only cared about earning work points and did not do party work, the vigilance against landlords and rich peasants was reduced, and the struggle against bad phenomena such as theft, gambling, and sabotage was not effective. In response, the Provincial Party Committee promptly issued a warning and made corrections. Now it seems that the nineteen old cooperatives can be basically consolidated, and a large number of new cooperatives can begin to embark on the road to consolidation, which is indeed a key. Now these nineteen old cooperatives have generally established relatively strong leadership cores, adhered to the system of first discussing major issues through the branch and then implementing them through the management committee, generally achieving that the branch can lead production without handling trivial matters, and establishing a relatively systematic system and method of party work and propaganda and mobilization work.

Second, in the cooperative, the Party's current leadership and ideological and political work must be clearly aimed at opposing the capitalist ideas of wealthy middle peasants as the main topic, and this struggle must be carried through to the cooperative's organizational construction, economic activities, and daily political life. After the province's advanced cooperativization, the struggle between the two roads mainly manifested itself in wealthy middle peasants vying for organizational leadership, attempting to change the cooperative's management policies according to their own needs, resisting the Party's policies, and ideologically dissolving the confidence and enthusiasm of cooperative members, spreading the air of "advanced cooperatives are not as good as primary cooperatives, primary cooperatives are not as good as mutual aid groups, and mutual aid groups are not as good as individual households," shaking backward cooperative members; vilifying the policy of unified purchase and sale; provoking the relationship between cadres and cooperative members; and even secretly instigating backward cooperative members to withdraw from the cooperative, attempting to restore exploitation, and so on. Therefore, the party organization in the cooperative must arm party members and basic masses with the ideas of class struggle, make the Party's political work regularized and combative, and constantly fight against this evil trend, and it is necessary to deepen political work into the ideological activities of cooperative members.

Third, in the Party's ideological and political work, it is necessary to adhere to the method of presenting facts, reasoning, and letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend. The old cooperatives have used the method of recollection and comparison many times in the political work of the past few years, and have achieved good results. Facts have proved that presenting facts and reasoning is the most effective mass line education method.

    黑龙江第一批高级社全部巩固
    这些社经过几年的发展，生产超过富裕中农的最高水平，每社平均有十二万元的公共财产，90％的社员达到中农生活水平；大多数社员爱社如家，社和队里形成了领导核心，有了比较系统的办社经验。
    本报讯　黑龙江省为了巩固大批新社，最近调查总结了全省在1951年到1955年期间先后试办的十九个高级农业生产合作社的经验。这些老社现在已经巩固了。这十九个社发展的历史证明，党中央和毛主席提出的关于办好一个合作社大体上需要五年或者更多一点的时间的估计是完全正确的。
    这些老社现在的基本状况是：生产有很大的发展，1956年每公顷的单位面积产量为三千零五十四斤（市斤，下同），比建社前提高了34.4％，比1956年全省平均产量提高了10％左右；开垦水旱田荒地为现有耕地面积的21.9％；相应地发展了多种经济生产，特别是农作物的单位面积产量达到和超过了富裕中农的最高水平。建立了社会主义的积累的基础，每社平均公有财产约十二万四千元，超过现在一般新社的两倍到三倍；基本上能满足本社发展生产的需要，并基本上作到内外不欠债务。社员收入逐年增加，农民物质文化生活有很大改善。个体农民时期每户每年平均收入二百元左右，现在每户每年平均收入六百元左右。建社以前贫困社员占总户数的35％，现在生活尚有困难的社员只占社员总数的9.4％，生活相当于往日富裕中农的社员已占31.6％，相当于一般中农生活水平的社员占59％。农民政治思想面貌有了深刻的变化，基本上树立了社会主义、爱国主义、集体主义的思想，基本上爱社如家的社员占69.7％。社、队形成了领导核心，贫雇农占绝对优势，生产秩序和管理制度比较健全，有了比较系统的办社经验。
    根据这些老社的经验，中共黑龙江省委现在计划在从建社时算起五年或者更多一点的时间内，把全省的农业合作社全部巩固下来。
    根据十九个老社的经验，在巩固合作社的工作中，主要要注意解决下面几个问题：
    集中力量提高单位面积产量逐步地发展多种经济
    十九个老社的生产能够不断地发展，经济基础能够不断地巩固，主要经验是正确地贯彻了集中力量提高单位面积产量、逐步地发展多种经济，以及节约资金、扩大再生产的经营方针。为了贯彻执行提高单位面积产量的方针，首先必须克服那种“不种千垧地，难打万石粮”的广种薄收的思想。十九个老社中有一部分社，开始的时候，不顾条件盲目扩大耕地面积，结果成本高、浪费大、增产不显著。当他们接受了这一教训后，就普遍地注意了改革农业技术，集中力量提高单位面积产量。在提高单位面积产量上，他们又坚持了改革农业技术的“全面和重点相结合”的方针。不仅注意改革农业技术的全面性、连续性和相关性，而且还根据不同地区条件，抓住提高单位面积产量带有关键性的增产措施，实行有重点的技术改革。这十九个老社在培育推广优良品种、增施粪肥、提高地力、防洪排涝、变旱田为水田、适时细致耕作等方面都取得显著成就。根据这些老社的经验，在黑龙江省如能真正抓住以上增产措施，加上全面技术改革的配合，争取今后十年内达到全国农业发展纲要（草案）中所要求的每亩产粮四百斤是有把握的。
    在注意提高粮食单位面积产量的同时，相应地发展多种经济。发展多种经济必须坚持以农业为主并为农业生产服务的方针。首先，多种经济一定要在不影响农业生产的条件下进行，就是要按劳动潜力发挥的程度来逐步发展多部门的生产。这一点在地多人少劳力不足的黑龙江省，尤关重要。这些老社凡是这样做了的，就克服了和避免了农业与其它生产在劳动力问题上的矛盾。第二，在多种经济的投资上，也曾经发生过两种偏向：一是单纯依靠国家贷款；二是抽农业资金搞副业。结果都影响了农业的发展。因此，多种经济的生产投资，主要应当依据农业发展的需要和资金的积累程度来决定。如果农业和副业在投资上有矛盾，应该先满足农业的需要，这样才能够使多种经济在可靠的基础之上发展。这些老社的经验也表明，多部门的生产必须经营有利，逐步为农业生产建设提供资金。因此，应当先搞投资小的、收效快的，后搞投资大的、获利多的。有些社开始注意铺摊子，追求投资多、规模大的项目，以为经营的部门越多，合作社的“优越性”也就越大。结果，正像社员们总结的那样：“花样不少，收入不多”。第三，多部门的生产一定要有相应的技术力量。为了掌握必要的技术，一方面可以选派骨干到国营农场和牧场去学习；另一方面，主要应当采取就地取材、就地培养、就地提高的方法。此外，为搞好多种经济，还须加强领导干部的配备。过去有些社曾把一些老弱残疾和没有经验的人安插在牧畜场、砖窑内，社员们把这些地方形容为“休养所”“养老院”。后来派了较强的干部进去，工作就有了起色。
    农业合作社的生产，必须依靠内部积累资金来发展。农业贷款是必要的，但在正常的情况下，不能依靠外力支援来发展生产。近二年来，这批老社已经基本上停止了向国家贷款，他们已经提出经济上“外不欠贷款，内不欠债务”，生产上作到基本自给的目标。实现这一目标的方法，主要是贯彻勤俭办社的方针，在生产和管理上建立节约制度。许多社实行了成本核算，坚持“少花钱，多办事”和“分级管理、个人负责、节约有奖、浪费有罚”的制度，支出大大减少。
    正确分配收益，合理调整积累和
    消费的关系，贯彻按劳付酬原则
    正确分配收益，是推动合作社巩固和发展的重要环节。而合理地调整积累和消费的关系与贯彻按劳付酬的原则，则是分配工作的两个基本方面。
    从老社发展的历史过程来看，在处理积累和消费关系上，经过了“只顾合作社不顾国家和社员”和“只顾社员不顾国家和合作社”到“三者兼顾”的曲折过程。从当前大批新社来看，重视消费忽视积累的现象仍然存在。有些社不还国家贷款，不留下年生产费用，不按时偿还社员余存的公有化股份基金，甚至有的把社员交上来的公有化股份基金按劳动日分配下去，以显示所谓“优越性”。这种用“上卡国家、下卡社员”的办法来扩大消费的办法，助长了社员的个人主义，影响了部分中农的积极性。造成这种现象，一方面是由于某些社存在着个人主义和本位主义思想，另一方面也是由于积累和消费的比例规定不当。从老社几年来分配工作的规律来看，积累和消费之间的比例应当掌握以丰补歉（丰收之年多积累，歉收之年少积累或不积累），量力投资，经营有利（生产投资要和正常的积累速度基本上吻合），以及在使用资金上，首先保证生产的需要，然后量力进行基本建设等三个原则。
    几年来的经验也说明了，在处理社员间的收益分配上，还必须注意克服平均主义和贯彻统筹兼顾适当安排的原则。分配工作中的平均主义常常表现在劳动日计算、农产品分配、安排社员经济生活三个方面。根据已经积累的经验，对于轻劳动、重劳动和技术高、技术低之间的定额不断地调整，才能逐步体现按劳付酬的分配原则。同时在另一方面，必须注意解决劳动过程中的质量与数量之间的矛盾。有些社在分配粮食上不论做劳动日多少，一律按人口、按“三定”留粮标准进行分配，也引起了广大社员的不满，必须改变。做得好的社坚持既保证全体社员必需的口粮，又照顾到工分做得多的那部分社员的需要，对劳动好的挣劳动日多的可以按“三定”的留粮标准领回全部吃粮，对劳动所得较少无力领回全部吃粮的另想办法解决，不随便占用别人的劳动日。这种办法不仅受到大多数社员的欢迎，就是对少数劳动差的也有很大的教育意义。
    为了使绝大多数社员增加收入，还必须常年一贯地把分配工作同安排社员的劳动力和经济生活结合起来，统筹兼顾，各得其所，使不同劳动能力的人都能尽量发挥他们的特长。宁安县团山子社在春天就把全社生产、劳动、收入的规划向全体社员公布，并动员所有社员根据社的规划制定家庭的劳动、收入、开支的规划，通过逐户的规划，合作社掌握了各户全年收入的大致情况，然后根据各户收入多少的不同，逐户地从参加社的劳动和家庭副业两个方面进行了具体安排。经过逐户规划，收入少的户都能增加收入，减少收入的户大大减少了，可以基本上避免合作社、超支户、亏空户之间的“三角债”。对于存款户的余资，也从翻盖房屋、扩大生产投资和发展家庭副业等方面进行了安排。
    加强党对合作社的领导加强思想政治工作
    加强党对于合作社的领导和加强思想政治工作，是巩固合作社的根本关键。从十九个老社和大批新社的发展过程来看，为了加强党的领导和加强思想政治工作，必须注意以下几个根本性问题：
    第一，必须及时克服忽视党的领导和思想政治工作的偏向。全省高级合作化以后，在基层党员中曾比较普遍地出现过这样一些错误的认识，即认为“地主富农绝大部分已经入社了，今后再没有阶级斗争了”，“合作化的任务已经完成了，两条道路的斗争已经结束了，今后的任务只是生产建设了，党员的任务也只是带头生产了”，“农民已经成为集体农民，高级社实行按劳取酬的制度，不用教育社员也能积极劳动了”。因此，党的领导和思想政治工作一度被削弱了。支部书记弱了，党员只顾挣工分不作党的工作了，对地主、富农的警惕性降低了，对偷盗、赌博、破坏等坏现象也斗争不力了。对此，省委曾及时发出警号，作了纠正。现在看来，十九个老社能够基本巩固，大批新社能够开始走上巩固的道路，这的确是一个关键。现在这十九个老社一般都建立了比较坚强的领导核心，坚持了重大问题首先经过支部讨论然后通过管委会执行的制度，一般作到了支部又能领导生产又不包办琐碎事务，建立了比较系统的党的工作和宣传鼓动工作的制度和方法。
    第二，在合作社内，当前党的领导和思想政治工作必须明确地以反对富裕中农的资本主义思想为主要课题，而这种斗争又必须贯穿到合作社的组织建设、经济活动和日常政治生活中去。全省高级合作化以后，两条道路的斗争主要表现在富裕中农争夺组织上的领导权，他们企图按着自己的需要去改变合作社的经营方针，抵制党的政策以及在思想上涣散社员的信心和积极性，散布“高级社不如初级社，初级社不如互助组，互助组不如单干户”的空气，动摇落后社员；诋毁统购统销政策；挑拨干部和社员的关系；甚至暗地里煽动落后社员退社，企图恢复剥削，等等。因此，党组织在合作社内必须以阶级斗争的思想武装党员和基本群众，使党的政治工作经常化和富有战斗性，经常同这种歪风邪气作斗争，要把政治工作深入到社员的思想活动中去。
    第三，在党的思想政治工作中，必须坚持摆事实、讲道理、大放大鸣大争的方法。老社在过去几年的政治工作中多次运用了回忆对比的方式，收到很好的效果。事实证明，摆事实、讲道理是最有效的群众路线的教育方法。
