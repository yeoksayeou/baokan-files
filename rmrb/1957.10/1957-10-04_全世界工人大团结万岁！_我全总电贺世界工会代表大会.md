To the Fourth World Trade Union Congress:

    On the occasion of the opening of the congress, on behalf of all male and female workers in China, I extend warm congratulations to the congress.

    The Chinese working class has always held the banner of the international working class's great unity—the World Federation of Trade Unions—in high esteem. The World Federation of Trade Unions has made tremendous contributions to the struggle for the unity and solidarity of the international working class, improving workers' lives and working conditions, striving for and safeguarding national independence, democratic freedom, and trade union rights, and defending world peace. The World Federation of Trade Unions' prestige among workers worldwide is growing day by day. Chinese workers are very excited about this. The Chinese trade unions fully support the World Federation of Trade Unions' support for the workers and people of all oppressed nations. At a time when the national independence movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America are rising to an unprecedented height, the heroic Syrian and Arab workers and people are fighting back against the unreasonable interference and aggression of U.S. imperialism, and colonialists' various conspiracies are suffering repeated and heavy defeats, we believe that this congress will make new contributions to the struggle for national independence and against colonialism.

    The Chinese working class is victoriously completing and overfulfilling the First Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule and is about to begin the Second Five-Year Plan. The rapid development of our socialist construction will strongly support the development of the world trade union movement and continuously strengthen the forces defending world peace. The Chinese working class is confidently welcoming the Fourth World Trade Union Congress with practical actions of building socialism.

    The Fourth Congress is a congress to enhance the unity and unification of the world trade union movement, a congress to encourage trade unions in all countries to strengthen friendly cooperation on a global scale, promote unity and unification, and better safeguard workers' interests, trade union rights, and defend peace. I wish the congress success!

    Long live the great international solidarity of workers all over the world!

    All-China Federation of Trade Unions, October 2nd, Beijing

    全世界工人大团结万岁！
    我全总电贺世界工会代表大会
    世界工会第四次代表大会：
    值此大会开幕之际，谨代表中国全体男女职工向大会致以热烈的祝贺。
    中国工人阶级一向对国际工人阶级大团结的旗帜——世界工会联合会怀着崇高的敬意。世界工联在争取国际工人阶级统一团结、提高工人生活与改善劳动条件、争取与维护民族独立、民主自由与工会权利、保卫世界和平的斗争中已经作出了巨大的贡献。世界工联在全世界工人中的威望与日俱增。中国工人对此感到十分兴奋。中国工会全力拥护世界工联对于全世界被压迫国家工人和人民的支援。值此亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲各国民族独立运动空前高涨，英勇的叙利亚和阿拉伯工人与人民在反击着美帝国主义的无理的干涉和侵略，殖民主义者各种阴谋不断遭到惨重失败之际，我们相信这次大会将对争取民族独立、反对殖民主义作出新的贡献。
    中国工人阶级正在胜利地提前和超额完成了第一个五年计划，并且就要开始第二个五年计划。我们的社会主义建设事业的迅速发展，将有力地支持世界工会运动的发展，和使保卫世界和平力量不断地增强。中国工人阶级正满怀信心地以建设社会主义的实际行动来迎接世界工会第四次代表大会。
    第四次代表大会是增进世界工会运动团结统一的大会，是鼓舞各国工会在世界范围内加强友好合作，促进团结统一，更好地为维护工人利益，工会权利与保卫和平的大会。谨祝大会成功！
    全世界工人的国际大团结万岁！
    中华全国总工会10月2日于北京
