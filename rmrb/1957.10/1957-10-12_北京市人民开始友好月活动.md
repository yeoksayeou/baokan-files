Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The employees of the Beijing Radio Factory, which recently commenced production, have begun preparations for celebratory activities. Banners proclaiming "Celebrating the Great October Revolution Anniversary" have been hung in the workshops. The factory's small newspaper, "The Bugle," has received the first batch of submissions celebrating the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution. Some workshop employees plan to invite the Soviet experts working at the factory to give reports on the October Revolution.

　　The Communist Party Committee and the Management Committee of the China-Soviet Friendship Agricultural Production Cooperative in the Babaoshan Township of Shijingshan District jointly convened a meeting on the 9th, deciding to hold a "China-Soviet Friendship Movement Month" from the 9th until around the anniversary of the October Revolution. During this Friendship Month, there will be celebratory rallies, photo exhibitions, reports, and symposiums. Radio broadcasts, cooperative newspapers, and blackboard bulletins will be used to widely publicize the great significance of the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution and the achievements of Soviet economic construction to cooperative members. The meeting also called on the members of the China-Soviet Friendship Agricultural Cooperative to use practical actions of increased production to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution.

　　The Beijing University Student Choir and the Soviet students at the university are preparing to establish a choir composed of both Chinese and Soviet students. This choir will perform songs such as "Moscow-Beijing" and "People of the World, One Heart" during the October Revolution anniversary celebrations.

　　Artists are engaged in creative activities to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution. Traditional Chinese painters Yu Feian, Wu Jingting, Hu Peheng, Qin Zhongwen, and Tian Shiguang are painting large-scale landscape paintings "Mount Tai at Sunrise" and flower paintings "Evergreen Pine and Cypress" to celebrate this great festival. Two of the five propaganda posters on the theme of China-Soviet friendship painted by Jiang Zhaohe, Zhang Zhengyu, and others have already been sent to press.

　　The Beijing Children's Palace has prepared a rich and colorful program of commemorative activities for the children. These activities include telling stories about the October Revolution, dances, recitations of Soviet poetry, and photo exhibitions.

　　The Beijing Library is preparing a book exhibition to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution.

　　In recent days, letters from workers and students to Soviet friends, congratulating them on the upcoming October Revolution anniversary, have been mailed to the Soviet Union from the Beijing Post Office. These include a letter from Guo Lu, the driver of the "China-Soviet Friendship" locomotive crew of the Fengtai Locomotive Depot in Beijing, to his old friend, Soviet driver Klimenchenco, as well as letters written in Russian to Soviet friends by students from the Beijing Russian Language Institute.
