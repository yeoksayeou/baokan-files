Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, October 28th: The first National Congress of the Hungarian Communist Youth League concluded here on the 27th. The meeting adopted a resolution on the report of the Youth League Organizing Committee and a draft of the Youth League Charter, and elected the leading body of the League.

    At the meeting on the 27th, the delegates also adopted a letter of respect to the Central Committee of the Soviet Lenin Communist Youth League.

    At the meeting on the 26th, the attendees listened to a speech by Kadar, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Workers' Party and Prime Minister of the Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government, and adopted a letter to the Party Central Committee. In the letter, the delegates expressed their loyalty to the cause of the Party and the socialist construction of the country.

    In his speech, Kadar pointed out that the establishment of the Communist Youth League seven months ago was a counter-offensive by Hungarian communists on the youth front against reactionary forces at home and abroad. Today, it can be affirmed that this struggle has been successful. Approximately 170,000 young people have organized themselves and stood under the banner of communism. This is a victory for the Hungarian youth movement and a victory for the entire Hungarian communist movement.

    Kadar said that in February and March of this year, enemies at home and abroad were still preparing to launch another attack against us, especially against young people. Their slogan was: "Let's start again in March." But we did not wait for them to start and launched a real counter-offensive. This is a real revolution, a socialist revolution, a revolution of the working class. There is no doubt that the Communist Youth League organization is a socialist, communist, and working-class organization.

    Speaking of the issue of democracy and freedom, Kadar said that the demand for democracy and freedom arises because some people do not enjoy democracy and freedom. If this happens in the United States, it is justified and in line with the requirements of human progress; it is the oppressed working class and other laborers demanding to enjoy their legitimate rights. However, in Hungary, demanding democracy and freedom means demanding the rights of freedom and democracy for the bourgeoisie and fascists. This is a demand against the Hungarian People's Republic.

    Kadar also criticized the slogan of "the leading role of youth."

    Kadar pointed out that the League should be concerned about every major issue of young people, including sports and recreational activities. But it should be remembered that the League is not a sports association or a shooting association, but a communist political organization, and it should conduct political work among young people.

    Kadar believes that the League's organization should be strengthened further. There are now about 400,000 party members. In the future, the number of League members can be slightly more than the number of party members.

    匈共青团代表会议表示忠于党的事业
    卡达尔强调加强青年政治工作
    据新华社布达佩斯28日电　匈牙利共产主义青年团第一次全国代表会议27日在这里闭幕。会议通过了关于共青团组织委员会的报告的决议和共青团章程草案，并且选举了团的领导机构。
    代表会议在27日的会议上还通过了给苏联列宁共产主义青年团中央委员会的表示敬意的信。
    在26日的会议上，与会者听了社会主义工人党中央第一书记、工农革命政府总理卡达尔的讲话，并且通过了给党中央的信。代表们在信里表示了自己对党的事业和国家社会主义建设事业的忠诚。
    卡达尔在讲话中指出，七个月以前共青团的成立，是匈牙利共产主义者在青年战线上向国内外反动势力进行的反攻。今天可以肯定地说，这个斗争是成功的。有大约十七万青年组织起来，站到共产主义旗帜下了。这是匈牙利青年运动的胜利，也是整个匈牙利共产主义运动的胜利。
    卡达尔说，今年2、3月间，国内外的敌人还准备向我们、首先是向青年们作再一次的进攻。他们的口号是：“3月里再开始。”但是我们不等他们开始，便进行了真正的反攻。这是真正的革命，社会主义的革命，工人阶级的革命。毫无疑问，共青团组织是社会主义的、共产主义的、工人阶级的组织。
    谈到民主自由的问题，卡达尔说，要求民主自由是因为有人没有享受到民主自由。这如果发生在美国，那是正当的，是符合于人类的进步要求的，那是为受压迫的工人阶级和其他劳动者要求享受正当的权利。但是，在匈牙利要求民主自由，那就意味着为资产阶级、法西斯分子要求自由民主的权利。这是反对匈牙利人民共和国的要求。
    卡达尔还批判了“青年的领导作用”这个口号。
    卡达尔指出，团应当关心青年的每一个重大问题，包括体育和文娱活动。但是应当记住，团不是体育协会或者射击协会，而是一个共产主义的政治组织，它应当在青年中进行政治工作。
    卡达尔认为，还要壮大团的组织。现在党员约有四十万。今后团员人数可以稍多于党员人数。
