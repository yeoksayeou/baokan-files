　　With the Soviet Union's selfless assistance,
    Xinjiang's construction has achieved great success
    Urumqi dispatch from our newspaper: In recent years, the Soviet Union's sincere, selfless, and comprehensive assistance has played a significant role in the various constructions of Xinjiang.
    In 1950, according to the agreement signed between the Soviet government and our government to establish two joint-stock companies in Xinjiang for non-ferrous and rare metals and petroleum, the Soviet Union dispatched a large number of experts and transported complete sets of machinery and equipment. During the period of Sino-Soviet joint ventures, Soviet experts trained our workers and built these two companies into large metal mining enterprises and petroleum joint enterprises. In January 1955, the Soviet Union transferred their shares to our country. After the discovery of the Karamay oil field, thousands of tons of equipment were promptly transported from the Soviet Union to the Karamay construction site.
    Since liberation, Xinjiang has successively established some modern factories, such as the Urumqi Thermal Power Plant and the October Automobile Repair Plant, which were built using the latest complete sets of machinery and equipment from the Soviet Union and under the guidance of Soviet experts.
    The Lanzhou-Urumqi-Aktogay railway passes through more than 1,000 kilometers of Xinjiang. In the route selection work, Soviet experts personally provided on-site guidance, making great contributions to the selection and design of the route. Soviet geological experts, in their field explorations in the north and south of the Tianshan Mountains, trained thousands of exploration personnel of various ethnic groups for Xinjiang, found many metal deposits with industrial value and more than one hundred promising oil structures, preparing for the large-scale development of industry in Xinjiang in the future.
    The significant progress in agricultural and pastoral production in Xinjiang since liberation is also inseparable from the help of the Soviet Union. In 1953, Soviet agricultural expert Titov, using advanced Soviet cotton planting experience, guided the production and construction corps to create a national record of 402 jin of seed cotton per mu on 20,000 mu of cotton fields in the Manas River basin. In 1954, under the guidance of Titov, Uygur farmers in Turpan County achieved 331 jin of seed cotton per mu on 36,000 mu of cotton fields throughout the county. In 1955, 82,000 mu of cotton in the Manas River Reclamation Area achieved another high yield, with more than 11,000 mu averaging more than 600 jin of seed cotton per mu.
    In July 1954, Soviet experts Volonin and Zhukov came to Xinjiang for inspection and put forward many valuable suggestions on the river basin planning, water conservancy, irrigation, and improvement of saline-alkali soils in Xinjiang.
    The Bosten Lake and Junggar Basin saline areas of Xinjiang have been plagued by locusts for many years. Since 1953, the Soviet government has dispatched locust control experts with airplanes and medicines to Xinjiang to help control locusts. After three years, the gregarious locusts in the Bosten Lake area were basically eliminated, and the major areas of the Junggar Basin were severely damaged by Italian locusts.
    The fine breeds of livestock imported from the Soviet Union are improving the livestock breeds of Xinjiang. The Gongnais Sheep Farm in the Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture has successfully bred the Xinjiang sheep, a hybrid of the Soviet Rambouillet sheep and the Xinjiang Kazakh sheep, which is our country's best breed and has been promoted in more than a dozen provinces and autonomous regions.
    Xinjiang's transportation, cultural education, and health care have also received strong assistance from the Soviet Union.

　　在苏联的无私援助下
    新疆建设获得巨大成就
    本报乌鲁木齐讯　几年来，苏联真诚无私的全面援助，对新疆各项建设起了巨大的作用。
    1950年，苏联政府根据和我国政府签订的在新疆创办有色及稀有金属和石油两个股份公司的协定，派遣了大批专家，并运来全套机器设备。在中苏合营期间，苏联专家一面培养我国职工，一面把这两个公司建设成巨大的金属矿山企业和石油联合企业，1955年1月，苏联又将他们的股份移交给我国。克拉玛依油田发现后，成千上万吨器材，从苏联及时地运到了克拉玛依工地。
    解放以来，新疆陆续建立了一些现代化工厂，如乌鲁木齐火力发电厂、十月汽车修配厂等，都是用苏联最新出品的全套机器设备，并在苏联专家指导下建立起来的。
    兰州—乌鲁木齐—阿克斗卡铁路经过新疆境内一千余公里，在选线工作中，苏联专家亲临现场指导，对线路的选择和设计，有很大的贡献。苏联地质专家在天山南北的野外勘探中，为新疆培养出几千名各民族勘探人员，找到了很多有工业价值的金属矿床和一百多个有希望的石油构造，给新疆地区今后大规模发展工业作了准备。
    解放后新疆农牧业生产上显著的进展也是与苏联的帮助分不开的。1953年，苏联农业专家提托夫，运用苏联先进的植棉经验，指导生产建设部队，在玛纳斯河流域，创造了两万亩棉田每亩平均产籽棉四百零二斤的全国最高纪录。1954年，吐鲁番县维吾尔族农民在提托夫指导下，全县三万六千亩棉花，每亩产籽棉三百三十一斤。1955年，玛纳斯河垦区八万二千亩棉花又获得高额丰收，其中有一万一千多亩，平均产籽棉六百多斤。
    1954年7月，苏联专家沃洛宁和儒可夫来新疆视察，对新疆河流的流域规划、水利、灌溉、改良盐渍土壤等方面，提出了许多宝贵的意见。
    新疆博斯腾湖滨和准噶尔盆地咸分地区，许多年来一直有蝗虫灾害。从1953年起，苏联政府派遣治蝗专家带着飞机和药品，到新疆帮助治蝗，经历三年，使博斯腾湖一带群集型的飞蝗基本消灭，准噶尔盆地主要地区的戟纹、意大利蝗虫等受到严重杀伤。
    从苏联输入的优良种畜正在改良着新疆牲畜品种。伊犁哈萨克自治州巩乃斯种羊场，用苏联兰布里羊和新疆哈萨克羊杂交育种成功的新疆羊，是我国最优良的品种，已在十几个省和自治区推广。
    新疆的交通运输、文化教育和卫生医疗事业，也得到了苏联的大力援助。
