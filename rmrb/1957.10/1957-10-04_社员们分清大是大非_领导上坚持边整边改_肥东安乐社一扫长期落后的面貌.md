    Commune Members Distinguish Right from Wrong, Leaders Persist in Rectification and Improvement While Rectifying
    Anle Commune in Feidong Sweeps Away Its Long-Standing Backwardness

    (Reported by this newspaper) The members of Anle Commune in Feidong County, Anhui Province, after distinguishing between right and wrong and rectifying the cooperative, are more determined to run the commune well with one heart and one mind and resolutely take the socialist road.

    According to statistics, the labor attendance rate of commune members has increased from 70.2% before the great debate to 95%. The harvesting of mid-season rice was completed not only twelve days earlier than last year, but at the same time as the mid-season rice harvest, 1,780 mu of paddy fields were plowed, compared with only 300 mu in the same period last year. Before the great debate, commune members were all accumulating fertilizer in their private plots, but now they are all selling it to the cooperative. As a result, the amount of fertilizer accumulated by the commune has increased sharply. Calculated based on the area sown in autumn, an average of 29 dan of fertilizer can be applied per mu, while 65% of the autumn crops last year were not fertilized. On this day last year, not a single grain of public grain had been handed over by the entire commune, and not a single grain of surplus grain had been sold. However, this year, within a dozen days after the great debate (by September 21), the commune members had not only completely paid their public grain, but had also completed 83% of the task of selling surplus grain. The task of purchasing public bonds for the entire commune was completed in just three days. These are rare phenomena since the establishment of the commune.

    Anle Commune was originally a third-class commune. There were serious problems in production management, leadership, suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and Party and Youth League organizations. The production enthusiasm of commune members was not high. As of July this year, there were still 315 mu of empty fields in the entire commune, and weeds in 20% of the dry land crops grew deeper than the crops themselves. Fifty of the 567 households in the commune expressed their determination to withdraw from the commune. This time, the commune fully mobilized the commune members to speak out freely. In eight days, commune members put forward more than 2,800 opinions, which were summarized into more than 90 issues. Twelve of the main issues could be improved with conditions, and the commune immediately rectified and resolved them. For example, of the 155 cadres in the entire commune, 69 often did not participate in production, but now all of them are participating in production. Since the establishment of the commune in 1955, the commune has never announced its accounts even once. Now all the accounts have been cleared and announced, and the commune members have a clear idea of them. In the past, the entire commune's rations were 520 jin regardless of the size of the mouth, but now the amount is determined according to the number of people. In the past, the commune implemented a rigid system of assigning and recording work points, regardless of gender, age, physical strength, or skills. Working a day was recorded as eight work points, resulting in phenomena such as "late to work, early to leave, and jogging at work," and "squatting in the fields and going home to get work points," which caused delays and wasted labor. Now this method has been changed, and the enthusiasm of commune members for labor has been greatly improved. In the year before the great debate, the Party and Youth League held only one branch meeting. Now the Party and Youth League organizational life has also returned to normal. In addition, counter-revolutionaries and bad elements who sabotaged the cooperative were also dealt with. The commune members were very happy about this, saying: "The government was too lenient in the past," and "This time, the roadblocks on the socialist road have been cleared away!"

    After seeing the commune's determination to accept the opinions of the masses and improve its work, and through the debate on major issues of right and wrong, the commune members raised their awareness and clarified the path they should take in the future, thereby strengthening their confidence in running the cooperative well. Those who had originally firmly demanded to withdraw from the commune no longer wanted to withdraw, and 16 of the 23 individual households applied to join the commune. The commune members said: "In the past, rectifying the commune was like water passing through the fields (without solving the problem), but now rectifying the commune is like burning iron in the fire."

### 社员们分清大是大非  领导上坚持边整边改  肥东安乐社一扫长期落后的面貌

    社员们分清大是大非  领导上坚持边整边改
    肥东安乐社一扫长期落后的面貌
    本报讯  安徽省肥东县安乐社的社员们在辩清了大是大非、整顿了合作社以后，同心合力办好社，坚决走社会主义道路的信心更加坚强。
    据统计，目前社员的劳动出勤率已从大辩论前的70.2％提高到95％。收割中稻不仅比去年提前十二天完成，和收割中稻的同时，还犁了板田一千七百八十亩，而去年同期仅犁了三百亩。大辩论前社员们都把积肥上到自留地里，现在全部卖给合作社，因此社里的积肥数量激增，按秋种面积计算，平均每亩可施肥二十九担，而去年的秋种作物却有65％没有施过肥。去年的今天，全社的公粮还一粒未交，余粮也一颗未卖，但今年就在大辩论后的十几天内（到9月21日），社员们除全部交纳完毕公粮外，卖余粮的任务也完成了83％。全社购买公债的任务，仅在三天内就完成了。这些，都是建社以来少有的现象。
    安乐社原是三类社，在生产管理、领导、镇反、党团组织等方面都存在着严重问题。社员生产积极性不高，到今年7月全社还有空白田三百一十五亩，旱地作物中有20％田地里的草长的比庄稼还深。全社五百六十七户就有五十户表示要坚决退社。这次社里充分发动了社员大鸣大放，在八天内社员提出二千八百多条意见，归纳成九十多个问题，其中十二个主要问题是有条件改进的，社里立即予以改正解决。如全社一百五十五名干部中，就有六十九名经常不参加生产，现在全部参加了生产。1955年建社以来，社里从未公布过一次账目，现在账目已全部清理公布，社员们都心中有了数。过去全社口粮不分大小口一律五百二十斤，现在实行以人定量。过去社里实行死分死记，不分男女老少，体力和技术，做一天活记八分工，以致造成“上工晚、收工早、干活赛小跑”，“田头蹲一蹲，回家拿工分”等窝工、混工现象。现在改变了这种办法，社员劳动积极性大大提高。在大辩论前的一年中，党和团都只开过一次支部大会，现在党团组织生活也正常了。此外，对破坏合作社的反革命和坏分子也进行了处理。对此，社员大为高兴，说：“政府过去宽大无边”，“这回可把社会主义道路上的拦路虎打净了！”
    社员们看到社里接受群众意见改进工作的决心后，又通过大是大非的辩论提高了觉悟，都明确了今后应走的道路，因而增强了办好合作社的信心。本来坚决要求退社的不退了，二十三户单干户中就有十六户申请入社。社员们说：“过去整社像田里过水（不解决问题），现在整社像火里烧铁”。
