The long-awaited "Italian Film Week" will be held in Beijing next week (October 29th to November 4th). This has been postponed because of waiting for the Italian film delegation invited to visit China. At that time, the delegation will meet with the Beijing audience who have been eagerly waiting.

The films participating in the Film Week include the following three:

“Loves of a Forbidden Priest”

This film tells the story of a small street in Florence, Italy, twenty-five years ago. Some ordinary working people lived on that small street. Their love, joy, and sorrow were common in life. However, under the fascist tyranny, their joy gradually turned into a bubble; their days became increasingly dim; their love was also impacted by the tide of the times. Life educated people. The middle-aged people gradually opened their eyes and understood who were the deadly enemies of the Italian people and who were the hopes of the Italian people. Young people not only tempered their love in the anti-fascist struggle, but also strengthened their will. People see the future of Italy from the awakening and growth of these ordinary working people.

“Such is Life”

This is composed of five short films: "Mara," "The Abandoned," "Too Late," "Useless Deaths," and "Grandpa Gualti." The lyrical atmosphere is very strong, as beautiful as poetry. Among them, "Mara," "The Abandoned," and "Useless Deaths" have complete structures and clear themes, fully reflecting the material and spiritual suffering of people in capitalist society. "Too Late" and "Grandpa Gualti" also have unique features in artistic treatment.

“The Policeman and the Thief”

A policeman with thirty years of service, in order not to be fired and to be loyal to his duty, had to use all his ingenuity and try all means to arrest a thief forced into crime by life. The thief carried the burden of a large family, so naturally he tried to avoid being arrested. One searching and one hiding, a contradiction unfolded, and the contradiction itself revealed the essence of Italian society and the real life of the people. This is the ideological content of this film.

The film adopts a comedy approach, with many fascinating, vivid, and interesting scenes. However, it not only makes people laugh, but also makes people think deeply. The profound ideological content of the film is made even more infectious by its excellent artistic skills. (Attached picture)

### 意大利电影周即将在京举行

    意大利电影周即将在京举行
    酝酿已久的“意大利电影周”，北京将在下周（10月29日到11月4日）举行。这是因为等待应我国邀请来访的意大利电影代表团，因此推迟，届时，代表团将同望眼欲穿的北京观众见面。
    参加电影周的影片，有以下三部：
    “苦难情侣”
    这部影片叙述了二十五年前意大利佛罗伦萨城内一条小街上的故事。那小街上住着一些平凡的劳动人民，他们的爱情、欢乐和忧愁，是生活中常见的。但在法西斯暴政下，他们的欢乐也逐渐化为泡影；他们的日子，越来越黯淡；他们的爱情，也受到了时代浪潮的冲击。生活教育了人们，中年人眼睛渐渐亮了，懂得了谁是意大利人民的死敌，谁是意大利人民的希望。青年人不仅在反法西斯斗争中磨炼了爱情，也锻炼了意志。人们从这些普通劳动人民的觉醒和成长的过程中，看到了意大利的未来。
    “如此人生”
    这是由“玛拉姑娘”、“弃儿”、“夕阳无限好”、“生不如死”、“高拉蒂大爷”五个短片合成的，抒情气氛很重，像诗一样的美丽。其中“玛拉姑娘”、“弃儿”和“生不如死”的结构都很完整，主题思想明显，充分反映了资本主义社会中人们所受的物质方面及精神方面的苦难。“夕阳无限好”和“高拉蒂大爷”在艺术处理上也有独到之处。
    “警察与小偷”
    一个有着三十年工龄的警察，为了不被解雇，也为了忠于职守，不得不用尽心机、想尽方法，去逮捕一个被生活逼上梁山的小偷。小偷背负着一大家子的生活，自然要百般逃避追捕。一个寻，一个躲，展开了矛盾，矛盾本身又揭示了意大利社会的实质和人民的真实生活。这就是这部影片的思想内容。
    影片采取了喜剧的手法，有着许多引人入胜的生动有趣的镜头。但是，它不仅使人发笑，而且使人深思。影片的深刻的思想内容，因为卓越的艺术技巧而更加富于感染力。（附图片）
