Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, October 19th: Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Bulganin, wrote to Japanese Prime Minister Kishi Nobusuke on October 15th, stating that the Soviet government firmly advocates for the immediate cessation of all atomic and hydrogen weapon testing, and has repeatedly declared its willingness to immediately sign relevant agreements with the other two countries testing nuclear weapons – the United States and Britain; this is a well-known fact.

In the letter, Bulganin expressed that the Soviet Union fully sympathizes with the Japanese government's concerns about the continued testing of atomic and hydrogen weapons, and is pleased with the Japanese government's desire for the 12th session of the United Nations General Assembly to take measures to stop such testing.

The letter stated, "We firmly believe that the Japanese delegation's proposal submitted to the United Nations General Assembly on September 23rd regarding this issue is an acknowledgement of the necessity to cease experimental explosions of atomic and hydrogen weapons. At the same time, we would like to emphasize that if we hope to quickly resolve this issue, the United Nations should not make the resolution of the issue of ceasing atomic and hydrogen weapon testing dependent on the simultaneous resolution of other disarmament measures, or use this as a prerequisite. The experience of the Disarmament Subcommittee negotiations shows that entangling the issue of ceasing testing with other issues will inevitably delay the resolution of the primary issue of ceasing nuclear and thermonuclear weapons testing."

Regarding the period for ceasing atomic and hydrogen weapon testing, Bulganin's letter suggested that the problem could be resolved if the Japanese delegation specified a concrete date for ceasing nuclear testing in its proposal, for example, starting from January 1, 1958, but this does not refer to one year, but two or three years.

Bulganin hoped that the Japanese government could assist in resolving the issue of ceasing atomic and hydrogen weapon testing and other disarmament issues as soon as possible. Bulganin said that it would be extremely beneficial if the Japanese delegation and the Soviet delegation to the United Nations General Assembly could maintain close contact and consult with each other in order to resolve these issues as soon as possible.

    布尔加宁写信告诉岸信介
    苏联坚决主张立即停止核试验
    希望日本政府协助尽快解决这个问题
    据新华社20日讯  塔斯社莫斯科19日讯：苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁10月15日写信给日本首相岸信介说，苏联政府坚决主张立即停止各种原子武器和氢武器试验，并且一再声明愿意立刻同试验核武器的另外两个国家——美国和英国签订有关的协定，这是众所周知的事实。
    布尔加宁在信中表示，苏联完全同情日本政府对继续试验原子武器和氢武器的忧虑，并且对日本政府希望联合国大会第十二届会议能采取措施来停止这种试验的要求感到满意。
    这封信写道，我们肯定地认为，日本代表团于本年9月23日提交联合国大会研究的有关这一问题的建议是承认必须停止原子武器和氢武器试验性爆炸的。同时我们想强调指出，如果我们希望迅速解决这个问题，那么，联合国在解决停止试验原子武器和氢武器问题时，就不应该取决于同时解决其他裁军措施，或以此作为先决条件。裁军小组委员会的谈判经验表明，把停止试验的问题和其他问题纠缠在一起，必然会拖延停止试验核武器和热核武器这个首要问题的解决。
    至于说到停止试验原子武器和氢武器的时期，布尔加宁的信中认为，只要日本代表团在提案中指明停止核试验的具体日期，例如，从1958年1月1日开始，不过，这并不是指一年，而是两三年，这样，问题就可以解决了。
    布尔加宁希望日本政府方面能够协助尽快地解决停止试验原子武器和氢武器问题以及其他裁军问题。布尔加宁说，如果联合国大会的日本代表团和苏联代表团能够保持紧密联系，并且为了尽快解决这些问题而互相磋商，这是极其有益的。
