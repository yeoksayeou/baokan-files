Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 11th - In recent years, the growth rate of Soviet livestock product output has greatly exceeded that of the United States.

In 1956, the total output of milk in the Soviet Union increased by 39% compared with 1950, while the United States only increased by 8%. Calculated per capita, the Soviet Union increased by 26% during this period, while the United States actually decreased by 2%.

In the first half of this year, meat production in Soviet collective farms and state farms increased by 30% compared with the same period last year, while meat production in the United States actually decreased by 4% in the first two months of this year compared with the same period last year. As of July 1 this year, the number of pigs owned by Soviet state farms and collective farms increased by 21% compared to a year ago, cattle increased by 8%, and sheep increased by 5%; the number of livestock in the United States decreased by 2% in 1956.

Currently, the milk production per capita in three Soviet republics has greatly exceeded that of the United States. These three republics are Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania along the Baltic coast. Last year, the milk production per capita in the United States was 343 kilograms; while Latvia was 522 kilograms, Estonia was 540 kilograms, and Lithuania was 402 kilograms. According to calculations, the milk production per capita in the Ukrainian Republic this year will exceed that of the United States; and the entire Soviet Union will catch up with the United States next year.

In recent months, Soviet agricultural laborers have launched competitions to strive to catch up with the United States in per capita meat, milk, and oil production in the next few years. So far, among the fifteen Soviet republics, Moldova, Latvia, Belarus, Estonia, Kazakhstan, Armenia, Kyrgyzstan, and other republics have put forward collective guarantees to complete this task.

This year, the animal husbandry of these republics has achieved great success. In the first seven months of this year, pigs in the Kazakh Republic increased by 47%, sheep increased by 36%, and cattle increased by 14%. During this period, meat produced by Estonian collective farms and state farms increased by 24% and 86% respectively compared with the same period last year, and milk increased by 29% and 20% respectively. In the first half of this year, meat and milk produced by Belarusian state farms and collective farms increased by 44% and 51% respectively compared with the same period last year, and meat and milk in Latvia increased by 22% and 35% respectively.

According to calculations, the Soviet Union only needs to produce 42 quintals (net weight) or 67 quintals (gross weight) of meat and 141 quintals of milk per 100 hectares of agricultural land to catch up with the United States. A feeder at the Shevchenko Collective Farm in Ukraine is feeding calves milk.

    社会主义农业集体化优越性的明证
    苏联畜产品增长速度超过美国
    新华社莫斯科11日电　最近几年来，苏联畜产品产量的增长速度大大超过美国。
    1956年，苏联牛奶总产量比1950年增加了39％，而美国只增加了8％，如果按人口平均计算，苏联在这段时期增加了26％，而美国反而减少了2％。
    今年上半年，苏联集体农庄和国营农场的肉类生产比去年同期增加了30％，而美国肉类生产在今年头两个月反而比去年同期减少了4％。到今年7月1日，苏联国营农场和集体农庄公有的猪比一年前增加了21％，牛增加了8％，羊增加了5％；美国在1956年一年内牲畜头数减少了2％。
    现在，苏联已经有三个加盟共和国的牛奶产量按人口平均计算大大超过了美国。这三个加盟共和国是波罗的海沿岸的拉脱维亚、爱沙尼亚和立陶宛。去年美国按人口平均计算的牛奶产量是三百四十三公斤；而拉脱维亚是五百二十二公斤，爱沙尼亚是五百四十公斤，立陶宛是四百零二公斤。根据计算，今年乌克兰加盟共和国的牛奶产量按人口平均计算将会超过美国；明年整个苏联也将赶上美国。
    最近几个月来，苏联农业劳动者纷纷展开竞赛，争取在最近几年内按人口平均计算的肉类、牛奶和油脂的产量赶上美国。到目前为止，苏联十五个加盟共和国中已经有摩尔达维亚、拉脱维亚、白俄罗斯、爱沙尼亚、哈萨克、亚美尼亚、吉尔吉斯等共和国提出了完成这个任务的集体保证。
    今年，这些共和国的畜牧业已经取得了巨大的成就。在今年头七个月内，哈萨克共和国的猪增加了47％，羊增加了36％，牛增加了14％。在这段时期，爱沙尼亚集体农庄和国营农场生产的肉类分别比去年同一时期增加了24％和86％，牛奶分别增加了29％和20％。今年上半年白俄罗斯的国营农场和集体农庄生产的肉类和牛奶，比去年同期分别增加了44％和51％，拉脱维亚的肉类和牛奶分别增加了22％和35％。
    根据计算，苏联每一百公顷农业用地只要生产肉类四十二公担（净重）或六十七公担（毛重）和牛奶一百四十一公担就可以赶上美国。苏联乌克兰舍甫钦柯集体农庄一饲养员正在给小牛喂奶。
