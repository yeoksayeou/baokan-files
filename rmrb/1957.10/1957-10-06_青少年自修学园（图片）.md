Teenager Self-Study Academy

    The Communist Youth League Qiqihar Municipal Committee and the Municipal Education Bureau recently established a large-scale "Teenager Self-Study Academy." They organized middle and primary school graduates who could not continue their education or find employment to study independently through radio broadcasts. The municipal radio station broadcasts teaching programs for six hours every day. Various government offices and factories have lent public spaces to them as study areas. The Yongding District Teenager Self-Study Group is listening to the broadcast in the dining hall of the Qiqihar Ice Skate Factory.

    青少年自修学园
    共青团齐齐哈尔市委会和市教育局最近举办了一个规模较大的“青少年自修学园”，把全市不能升学和就业的中小学毕业生组织起来，通过广播教学来进行自学。市广播电台每天进行六小时的广播教学。各机关、工厂把公共场所借给他们作为学习场所。永定区青少年自修小组正在齐齐哈尔冰刀厂的饭厅里，收听广播。
