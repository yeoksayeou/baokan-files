【Reported by our newspaper from Jilu Yu, April 11th】In Daguzhuang, Zhuxian (Liaocheng), spring plowing is being carried out in conjunction with land reform. The first step is to organize mutual aid to overcome the difficulty of insufficient labor. Among the 40 households in the village, 7 are military families, 8 are elderly and childless households, 6 provide carts, and 7 are preparing to provide stretchers, so the labor force is quite insufficient, resulting in 50 mu of garden land unable to be cultivated. Recently, with the help of district cadres, mutual aid has been organized to plant garlic; young people dig the soil and roll it, old men adjust the ridges, and women and children peel garlic and plant the seeds, truly ensuring that no one is idle and no land is wasted. In addition to the village cadres taking the lead, five people were selected to inspect the work on time, and the work was democratically evaluated and priced according to labor and performance at the evening meetings (paying for the labor of planting garlic for military families and families participating in the war). Those who did particularly well were also praised on the blackboard bulletin. On the first day, young man Gu Yanhe did the work of three people, and he was praised in the bulletin at the evening meeting, which further boosted the morale of the masses. Even the lazy man Chen Jinshan and the old man Chengfu worked very hard. The 50 mu of garlic was all planted in six days, and 14 models emerged in the process of mutual aid. At the same time, the Land Reform Committee registered the land, and everyone took time to distribute the land, combining mass mobilization and production. Now, the masses in the village have changed from being worried and depressed to being active and positive. The families of those participating in the war said: "It doesn't matter if the carts come a few days late, anyway, nothing will be delayed."

    大顾庄男女互助劳动
    【本报冀鲁豫十一日电】筑先（聊城）大顾庄结合土地改革进行春耕，首先组织互助，克服劳力不足困难。该庄四十户中即有七家军属，八家老绝户，六家出车，七家准备出担架，劳力颇感不足，致五十亩园地不能耕种。最近在区干部帮助下，互助起来种大蒜；青年掘地、打辘辘，老头调畦子，妇女、儿童剥蒜皮、按蒜种，真正作到不闲一个人，不误一亩地。除村干领头外，并举出了五个人按时验工，按劳力、成绩大小于晚上开会时民主评工折价（给军属和参战家属种蒜支差），特别好的还上黑板报表扬。开始第一天，青年顾延河即作了三个人的活，晚上开会时就给他出了报，群众情绪遂更为高涨，连懒汉陈金山和老汉承福也干的非常起劲。五十亩蒜六天即全部种完，并在互助中涌现十四个模范。与此同时，土地改革委员会登记土地，大家抽空分地，群运生产结合进行。现该村群众已由愁苦消沉趋活跃积极，参战家属说：“出车的晚来几天也不要紧，反正什么活也耽误不了。”
