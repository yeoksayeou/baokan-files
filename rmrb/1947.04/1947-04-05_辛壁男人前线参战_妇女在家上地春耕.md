　　Xinbi Men Join the Front Lines
    Women Farm the Fields at Home in Spring
    [This report from Taiyue, 3rd] The liberated women of ten administrative villages in the Xinbi base point of Jincheng Third District are actively participating in major agricultural labor, solving the difficulty of labor shortages. The young and middle-aged men of this base point went to the front lines to protect Chairman Mao, and coupled with the lack of livestock, plowing the land required pulling plows, making the labor shortage even more acute. The women of Xinbi Village have always been models of support for the front lines. Seeing this difficulty, they volunteered to replace the men in pulling the plows. At first, the men looked down on them, and mutual aid groups were unwilling to have women participate. When the head of the first mutual aid group initially sent a few women to plow land for group members, everyone was very unwelcoming, saying, "Women aren't good at plowing, and you have to plow twice where they plow." The young woman Li Ruan was not convinced. She worked harder and plowed strongly, and as a result, one person could handle the work of three. Bu Zheng Nai, a 65-year-old woman from the thirty-second group, pulled the plow just like the young people, earning praise from the whole village; from then on, no one said women weren't up to the task. The chairman of the Jiaoge Women's Federation is a soldier's family member. Not only did she decline the preferential treatment offered to her by the masses, but she also patiently persuaded and organized all the soldiers' family members and women to participate in agricultural production. Now, forty young and strong women have been organized to actively dig and pull plows. An Ying, the chairman of the Xinbi Women's Federation, is leading seventy women in digging the land, with blisters all over her hands, but she refuses to rest. Li Fuwen and other women from Mapingtou are carrying manure like the men.

　　辛壁男人前线参战
    妇女在家上地春耕
    【本报太岳三日电】晋城三区辛壁基点十个行政村翻身妇女积极参加农业主要劳动，解决了劳动力缺乏的困难。该基点青壮年为保卫毛主席奔赴前线参战，加以牲口缺乏，耕地须用拉犁，劳力更感不足。辛壁村妇女一贯为支援前线的模范，看到这种困难，即自报奋勇，代替男人拉犁。开始男人轻视她们，互助组不愿要妇女参加。第一互助组长初次派出几个妇女给组员犁地时，大家很不欢迎，都说：“妇女强犁不顶事，她们犁过还得犁二遍。”青年妇女李软不服气，她加倍努力强犁，结果一人竟顶住三人。三十二组六十五岁的补正奶，亦与青年人一样的拉犁，得到全村赞扬；从此再没人说妇女不顶事了。焦河妇救会主席是军属，她不但谢绝了群众对她的优待，而且耐心说服与组织全体军属及妇女参加农业生产；现已组织了四十个青壮妇女积极刨地拉犁。辛壁妇救会主席安英，领导着七十个妇女刨地，满手打了血泡，亦不肯休息。马坪头妇女李福文等十人，与男人一样担粪。
