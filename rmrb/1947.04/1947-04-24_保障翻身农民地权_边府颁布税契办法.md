    Guaranteeing Land Rights for Liberated Peasants
    Border Region Government Promulgates Tax Deed Measures

    [Special Dispatch from this newspaper] In order to adapt to the significant changes in rural land relations since the land reform, protect the land rights and property rights obtained by peasants during the movement, meet the peasants' desire for tax deeds, consolidate peasants' production enthusiasm, and at the same time, guarantee front-line supply, achieve victory in the self-defense war, and solve financial difficulties, the Border Region Government has decided to uniformly implement the following measures for the collection of deed taxes in the entire region: (1) After the land reform, all districts should universally carry out deed establishment, deed verification, deed supplementation, and tax payment. Based on the following two principles: 1. All contracts on which taxes have been paid to the democratic government shall be deemed legal and shall not be exchanged or replaced. However, if the owner of the land or house has changed, the deed must still be replaced and taxes paid. 2. All contracts on which taxes have been paid to the enemy puppet government, the old government before the War of Resistance, or the Chiang Yan warlord regime must be re-exchanged and taxes paid. (2) The tax rate for deed tax collection shall be levied according to five grades based on land yield: Special Grade: Those with a yield of 2.8 shi and 8 dou per mu or more shall be taxed 300 yuan per mu; Grade 1: Those with a yield of 1 shi, 8 dou, and 1 sheng or more to 2 shi and 8 dou shall be taxed 250 yuan per mu; Grade 2: Those with a yield of 1 shi and 1 dou or more to 1 shi and 8 dou shall be taxed 200 yuan per mu; Grade 3: Those with a yield of 3 dou and 5 sheng and 1 ge or more to 1 shi shall be taxed 150 yuan per mu; Grade 4: Those with a yield of 3 dou and 5 sheng or less per mu shall be taxed 100 yuan per mu. The yield is based on coarse grains. The houses, cave dwellings, and non-cultivated areas, threshing grounds, bamboo gardens, empty courtyards, etc., shall be assessed by each district according to the situation, and shall generally be stipulated as Grade 2. (3) On tax exemption for deed establishment and tax payment: 1. For farmland and houses obtained by peasants in the anti-traitor liquidation movement, they shall establish deeds and pay taxes to the local county government within the time limit. The deed must have the signature and seal of the village head and the director of the farmers' association, and be stamped with the village public office seal. 2. For farmland reclaimed by peasants through beach reclamation and wasteland reclamation, those who hold documentary evidence from the village head and the director of the farmers' association shall only establish a deed without paying taxes, but those that were originally cultivated wasteland must still pay taxes. 3. In the land reform, peasants who are given or exchange farmland and houses with landlords shall be allowed to exchange deeds and pay taxes after being certified by the village public office and having the signature and seal of the village head and the director of the farmers' association. 4. In the land reform, those who first pawn and then buy shall be levied half of the tax according to the land grade yield when exchanging deeds. 5. Pawn deeds before the land reform shall be regarded as purchase deeds, and the tax payment shall be in accordance with the four provisions. 6. The principle of deed paper is one deed for one property, and farmland and houses that are not connected shall not be combined into one deed. (Wang Ziying)

    保障翻身农民地权
    边府颁布税契办法
    【本报特讯】边府为适应土地改革以来，农村土地关系之极大变化，及保障农民在运动中获得之地权、产权，符合农民要求税契立纸之愿望，巩固农民生产情绪；同时，为保证前线供给，取得自卫战争胜利，解决财政困难，特决定统一全区契税征收办法如下：（一）在土地改革后，各区应普遍进行立契、验契、补契、投税。根据以下两个原则：１、凡在民主政府投税之契约，一律认为合法，不再换契换约。但土地房屋已改业主者，仍须换契纳税。２、凡在敌伪政府及抗战前旧政权或蒋阎顽政权投税之契约，一律须重新换契纳税。（二）契税征收税率，按土地产量分五等征收，特等：每亩产量在二石八斗以上者，每亩征税三百元，一等：每亩产量一石八斗一以上至二石八斗者，每亩征税二五○元，二等：在一石一以上至一石八斗者，每亩征税二百元，三等：每亩在三斗五升一以上至一石者，每亩征税一五○元，四等：每亩在三斗五升以下者，每亩征税一百元，产量以粗粮为标准。其房屋窑洞及不耕作之场面竹园空院等，由各区根据情况估定，一般应以二等地规定。（三）在立契投税免税上：１、农民在反奸清算运动中获得之田房，在限期内，向当地县政府立契纳税，契上须有村长农会主任签名盖章，加盖村公所戳记。２、农民修滩开荒造成之田地，持有村长农会主任之证明文件者，只立契约不纳税，但原为熟荒者，仍须投税。３、在土地改革中，农民给地主留得或更换之田房，经村公所证明，并有村长农会主任签字盖章者，准予换契纳税。４、在土地改革中，先典后买者，换契时按地等产量折半征收税款。５、土地改革前之典契，均作买契论，其税款交纳，如四项规定。６、契纸以一产一契为原则，不得归并不相连接之田房，合立一契。（王子英）
