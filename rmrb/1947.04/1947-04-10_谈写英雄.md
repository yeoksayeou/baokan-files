　　On Writing About Heroes
    Shang Yin
    In the revolutionary struggles of the people, heroes emerge constantly. However, how to bring them vividly to life on paper is a question.

    Usually, works describing heroes are limited to recording some of their heroic deeds. It cannot be said that this method is wrong, because only through many facts can it be expressed what kind of heroic figure they are. Talking about heroes without this series of heroic deeds is bound to fail. What is particularly important is that being able to describe heroes from facts is still a major creative advancement for many of our writers. This allows us to avoid starting from concepts (which are often outdated and vague), to transcend old perspectives, and to discover and acknowledge new figures from new things.

    However, in terms of creative requirements, we cannot stop at simple factual narratives. Simple factual narratives, although sometimes there are some more prominent scenes, their changes are still very limited. Over time, they will gradually move towards a model, a formula, how many enemies were killed, how many guns were seized, how many mines were detonated. This kind of record in the style of an account book makes it difficult to give people a deep and prominent impression. Here, I think the description of the hero's personality and thought is very important. Because the hero’s personality and thought are more delicate and complex. For example, there are various facts about heroes' successes, and there are various reasons and processes for heroes' successes. Wang Keqin and Lü Dengke, one was for revenge and to turn the tables, the other was to protect his home and land. Being able to portray their thoughts and personalities in all aspects makes them appear particularly lively and vivid. Many heroic and model deeds should be organically linked with the hero’s thoughts and personalities, and expressed as the concentration or sublimation of the hero’s thoughts and personalities, so as to write living people of flesh and blood.

    To express thoughts and personalities well, the author must have a correct understanding of the heroic figures being recorded. Generally speaking, many of our authors think that this problem has been solved, but in fact, they are often still constrained and limited by old consciousness, so they cannot deeply understand specific heroic figures, and it is not easy to be appropriate in the description of ideological personality and other details, and even in the selection of characters. If we have a truly clear understanding of heroes after close contact, friendship, or careful experience and research, then there are many vivid and concrete deeds that can be written, without writing dry models. Still taking Wang Keqin and Lü Dengke as examples, the former was a peasant under Chiang Kai-shek's rule, and was also conscripted into the army, his experience must have a profound impact on his thoughts and feelings. His becoming a hero has not only different reasons and processes from Lü Dengke, but is also significantly different from other liberation soldiers. Recognizing why he is a hero, discovering and describing them will give us a further and more accurate understanding of all aspects of heroic figures (class composition, ideological development process, heroic deeds, etc.). When putting pen to paper, we will not equip them with a "brave steed", a "tall and sturdy body" and other fabricated unreasonable things and strange actions.

    The heroes written in this way are the mass heroes who grow out of the ordinary and surpass the ordinary. They are real and credible, kind and sensible, and no longer a slightly different and rough copy of a heroic model.

    If you want to portray the heroic characters' thoughts and personalities well, you mainly rely on doing more investigation and research, paying close attention to the heroes' various lives, personally observing, experiencing, etc., and analyzing the ideological reasons that caused these heroic deeds. Many of our current works about heroes come from other people’s direct or indirect narratives, and sometimes even without the author’s ideological judgment or processing, they are just straightforward records. This method was inevitable and even necessary in the early days of the Patriotic Self-Defense War, but today neither readers nor authors will be satisfied with this. If we want to go further, we must have close contact, in-depth understanding, correct understanding, and bright thoughts of the heroic figures. The heroes written in this way will not only be highly authentic, but also guide others to understand how to become heroes and promote the emergence of heroes on the people's front.

　　谈写英雄
    尚吟
    在人民群众的革命斗争里，不时涌现出大批英雄，但是，如何把他们活现到纸上，这是一个问题。
    通常见到描述英雄的作品，大都是只限于纪录他们的一些英勇事迹。这种写法，不能说是不对的，因为只有通过许许多多的事实，才能表达出他是个怎样的英雄人物，离开这一连串的英勇事迹去谈英雄，结果必然落空。而尤其重要的，能够从事实上去描述英雄，对我们不少作家说来，还是一个创作上的大进步，这使得我们不是从概念出发（而这个概念往往是陈旧的，模糊的），能超越旧的视野，从新事物上去发现和承认新人物。
    但是，在创作的要求上，我们不能止步于单纯的事实纪叙上，单纯的事实纪叙，尽管有时也有些比较突出的场面，它的变化毕竟还很有限，久而久之渐渐就会走向一个模型，一种公式，打死了多少敌人，缴了几根枪，炸响了几个雷，这样流水账式的纪叙，就很难给人以深刻的突出印象，在这里，我以为对英雄人物本身（思想，个性）的描写，是十分重要的。因为人物个性思想，比较细腻复杂，比如英雄成功的事实有种种；英雄的成功原因、过程也有种种。王克勤和吕登科，有的是为复仇翻身，有的是为保家保田，能够把他们的思想个性各方面都刻划出来，就显得格外活泼生动。许许多多的英雄模范事迹，应该和人物的思想个性有机地联系起来，作为人物思想个性的集中或升华来表现，这样才能写出有血肉的活生生的人物。
    要把思想个性很好地表现出来，作者必须对所记英雄人物有一个正确的认识。这个问题，一般说来，我们很多作者都以为是解决了的，其实时常还受到旧意识的约束和限制，因而对具体英雄人物无法深入了解，在思想个性等细节的描写上，以至人物的选择上，都不易得当。如果我们经过亲切的接触交友或仔细的体会研究，对英雄的认识真正明确起来，那就有许多生动具体、使人感动的事迹可写，而不致于写成干巴巴的模式。仍拿王克勤和吕登科来说，前者是在蒋介石统治下的农民，又被抓丁当兵，他的经历对他的思想感情必有深厚的影响。他之成为英雄，不仅和吕登科有不同的原因和过程，就是和其他解放战士，也各有显著的不同。认清了他之所以英雄，去发现和描述他们，就会对英雄人物的各方面（阶级成份、思想发展过程、英勇事迹等等）有更进一步的确切的了解。当下笔的时候，就不会给他们先配上一匹“骠悍的骏马”、一个“魁伟的身躯”。以及其他臆造出来的不合理的东西和奇奇怪怪的动作来。
    这样写出的英雄，才是从平凡中生长出来而又超出平凡的群众英雄，才是真实可信的，亲切可感的，而不再是一种英雄模型的微有不同的粗糙的翻板。
    要想把英雄人物的思想个性描划好，主要靠多多调查研究，密切注意英雄们的各种生活，亲身去观察、体会等，并分析造成这种英勇事迹的思想原因，我们现下不少写英雄的作品是来自别人直接或间接的讲述，有时甚至未经作者思想上的判断或加工，只是平直的纪录而已。这种写法，在爱国自卫战争的初期是难免、甚且是必要的，然而今天无论读者作者，都不会满足于此了。要想更进一步，就必须对英雄人物有亲切的接触、深入的了解，正确的认识，明亮的思想，这样写出来的英雄，才不仅高度地真实，而且会引导别人懂得如何才能成为英雄，推动人民战线上英雄辈出。
