Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 20th—Since late last month, the military and civilians in the Lu Nan mountain area have been engaged in a struggle against the "purge." The military and civilians on the periphery of the mountain area simultaneously launched diversionary battles. According to incomplete statistics, in more than a hundred battles, large and small, over twenty days, they killed or wounded more than 3,800 Chiang troops and destroyed more than twenty enemy and puppet district and township governments and strongholds in the important town of Lanling and other areas. Since the end of last month, Chiang’s troops, including the 11th, 82nd, 74th, 25th, 77th, and 59th Divisions, have advanced from towns such as Sishui, Zou County, Teng County, Linyi, Yixian, and Zaozhuang along highways such as Lin (Yi)-Zi (Yang) and Teng (County)-Zi (Yang) towards the center of the mountain area, Baiyan, Liangqiu, and the Pingyi mountain area to the north, for a "purge." The local military and civilians then "obstructed step by step," firing guns from every mountain, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy. The enemy troops under Feng Zhi'an, advancing from the south, entered the upper and lower Shihe and Baodugushan mountains on the 20th of last month, suffering more than 200 casualties. The enemy's 83rd Division, advancing from the east, encountered more than 30 ambushes by militiamen on the Lin (Yi)-Fei (County) highway, killing or wounding more than 100, including company commanders. They advanced only forty li in more than ten days. On the afternoon of the 30th, the enemy troops in the south risked entering the Liangqiu area, but were counterattacked within three hours, and fled south in a panic. The local military and civilians intercepted them along the way, seizing three 60mm mortars and 19 light machine guns. Thus, the enemy's attempt to converge on Liangqiu was foiled for the first time, forcing the enemy to retreat to Chenqian, Feicheng, Sishui, Yixian, Zaozhuang and other places. Since the beginning of this month, the enemy troops from all directions have gathered their forces to launch another large-scale invasion of Gangkou, Baodu Bai, Lushu, Tianbao Hui, Shanyan, Liangqiu, Pingyi and other places. On the 5th, the local military and civilians annihilated more than 200 enemy troops invading Yanshan. By the morning of the 7th, a total of 400 had been killed or wounded in two attacks, and more than 420, including a battalion commander, were captured alive, along with eleven light machine guns, one 60mm mortar, more than 80 rifles, and more than 10,000 rounds of ammunition. Currently, the enemy engaged in the "purge" in the mountainous area, under the resistance and harassment, has retreated to the Baiyan, Guanyang, and Liangqiu line. There are no traces of the enemy north of Baiyan, from Pingyi to Shanyin, Tancheng, and from Tianbaoshan to Fengyang.
