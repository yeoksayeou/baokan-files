    Militia of Various Counties in Taiyue Rush to the Front Lines
    [This newspaper's Taiyue dispatch, 15th] To coordinate with the Jin-Nan People's Liberation Army offensive, four thousand militia from eight counties including Yangcheng and Hongdong, rushed to the Jin-Nan front lines on the 4th. One detachment marched 280 li in three days, and even with blisters on their feet, they had no complaints, instead regarding it as an honor. Qin Fengyun, a 50-year-old man, followed the militia to the battlefield, serving as the cook squad leader of the first company of one detachment. Militiamen from various places voluntarily proposed to abide by five major disciplines: (1) Resolutely obey orders from superiors and complete every task assigned. (2) Strictly abide by mass discipline and battlefield discipline, ensuring that not even the slightest offense is committed. (3) Seize the gaps in the war to practice martial arts and improve skills in killing the enemy. (4) Unite and love each other, taking care of each other. (5) Each person should make at least one contribution. Many militiamen also made personal plans. Qin Fengyun of the cook squad proposed: (1) Guarantee that everyone will not eat undercooked rice and will always have boiled water to drink. (2) Guarantee that everyone eats on time and has a full meal. (3) Save grain and improve living conditions. Liu Chunhan, a cook in the second company of the fourth detachment, made a guarantee, saying: "Rather have the food waiting for the people, than have the people waiting for the food." After receiving the task of covering the delivery of ammunition, the second platoon of the first company of the second battalion of the fourth detachment was exceptionally enthusiastic, braving enemy artillery fire and successfully completing the task.
    [This newspaper's Taiyue front line dispatch, 15th] On the eve of the Yicheng battle—the 3rd—more than 400 members of the Linfen and Xiangling guerrilla militia bravely performed meritorious service. First, they carried out large-scale sabotage in Jia Zhuang village, carrying back 42 rails and more than 200 sleepers in one hour. The Xiangling armed work team then captured 13 Yan army soldiers alive in Liuzhuang and Dongchai areas south of Xiangling city without firing a single shot, seizing 6 rifles, more than 200 rounds of ammunition, one war horse, and other materials.
