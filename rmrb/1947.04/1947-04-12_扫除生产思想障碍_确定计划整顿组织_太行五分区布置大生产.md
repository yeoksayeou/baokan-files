　　Eliminate Ideological Obstacles to Production
    Determine Plans to Rectify Organizations
    Taihang Fifth District Deploys Large-Scale Production
    [Our Newspaper] In order to further promote the large-scale production movement, the Fifth Prefectural Commissioner's Office convened a meeting of the heads of construction sections of various counties on March 20th. The meeting was to exchange experiences in production leadership and organization from the previous year, formulate annual production plans, and, based on the current situation, focus on studying the integration of war and production. The main points for carrying out this year's production movement are as follows:
    1. Further eliminate ideological obstacles, thoroughly resolve the "small peasant mentality," the "cut-and-run mentality," and the "rely-on-struggle mentality," and establish the idea that "labor is glorious, and production leads to prosperity." Pay attention to solving the difficulties faced by peasants who have been liberated in terms of agricultural tools, fertilizers, seeds, and livestock. 2. Boldly organize the masses. A bold mobilization and large-scale organization should be carried out to create a red-hot large-scale production movement, such as the mobilization meetings of district and village cadres and model heroes with six or seven hundred people in the old areas of Wu'an last year, the inspection movement between groups and villages, and the cotton crossing movement. 3. The masses should be clear about the production policy, promote the enthusiasm of the masses, fully utilize surplus labor, carry out sideline production according to different production conditions, and achieve the goal of cultivating three parts of land and having one part surplus. After organizing, there must be specific production content and goals. The experience of Wu'an and Shexian last year was that without combining sideline production, it would not be possible to consolidate mutual aid groups. Shexian promoted Wang Jinzhuang's production experience of combining agriculture and sideline industries, further advancing the county's production. 4. Implement the labor model policy, carry out the new heroism movement, commend and summarize immediately, and conduct mass selection of heroes and models, giving them rewards. 5. The combination of war and production. Whether in old or new areas, universal organization must be carried out to overcome the difficulties of labor and livestock power in the war, ensure rear production, reward family mutual aid, and mobilize large numbers of children, women, and old men to participate in production, so that war and production are closely combined, overcoming the past method of temporarily assigning labor for assisting cultivation. Promote the mutual aid organizational form of unified leadership and division of responsibilities in Houchi Village, Shexian County. Border areas should promote the experience of combining labor and military affairs, carry out large-scale labor exchange, and complete seasonal production tasks in a concentrated manner. Without affecting the war, attention should be paid to organizing front-line combatants to help local production and give them compensation. 6. Rectify mutual aid. In old areas and areas with mutual aid organizations, democracy should be thoroughly promoted, and mutual aid groups should be rectified on the basis of equal value.

　　扫除生产思想障碍
    确定计划整顿组织
    太行五分区布置大生产
    【本报讯】为了进一步开展大生产运动，五专署于三月二十日召开了各县建设科长会议，交流去年生产领导与组织起来的经验，制定全年生产计划，并根据目前形势，着重研究了战争和生产结合的问题，对如何开展今年的生产运动，主要有以下几点：
    一、进一步扫除思想障碍，彻底解决“圪塔户思想”、“割韭菜思想”、“吃斗争饭思想”，树立“劳动光荣，生产发家”的思想。注意解决翻身农民在生产上农具、肥料、种籽、牲口等困难。二、放手的组织起来。应放手的大动员，大组织，造成热火朝天的大生产运动，如武安老区去年六七百人的区村干部、英雄模范生产动员大会，组与组、村与村的检查运动，棉花打叉运动等作法。三、应使群众明确生产方针，发扬群众的积极性，充分的运用剩余劳力，根据不同的生产条件进行副业生产，实现耕三余一。组织起来之后，必须有具体的生产内容与奋斗目标，去年武安，涉县的经验是：不结合副业生产，就不能巩固互助组。涉县发扬王金庄农副业结合的生产经验，使全县的生产更推进一步。四、贯彻劳模政策，开展新英雄主义运动，即时表扬，即时总结，进行群众性的评选英雄模范，给以奖励。五、战争和生产结合。无论新老区必须普遍组织起来，克服战争中劳畜力的困难，保证后方生产，奖励全家互助，大量发动儿童妇女老汉参加生产，使战争和生产密切结合，克服过去临时派差助耕的办法。发扬涉县后池村统一领导分工负责的互助组织形式。边沿区应发扬劳武结合的经验，进行大变工，突击完成季节生产任务，在不影响战争的情况下，需注意组织前方参战人员帮助地方生产，给以代价。六、整顿互助。在老区及有互助组织的地区，应彻底发扬民主，贯彻等价整顿互助组。
