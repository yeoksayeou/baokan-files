　　An Introduction to Mass Dyeing Methods
  　How to Dye Grayish-Yellow-Green
    Ma Lin
    Foreign dyes are too expensive now. The Border Region Government is calling for the development of local dyes and indigenous dyeing and weaving methods. Comrade Ma Lin has sent us effective dyeing methods used by the masses in Wuxiang over the past three or four years. We will publish them in installments. We hope readers from all areas will continue to collect and send in such information. – Editor

  　Several Methods for Dyeing Gray
    1.  Acorn Shell Dyeing: Taking 100 square feet of cloth as an example, use twelve taels of acorn shells and add more than one bucket of water to boil. After boiling, soak the cloth in water beforehand and put it into the black water to boil. Then, dissolve one tael and seven qian of black alum in boiling water and put it in the pot. The color will then be applied to the cloth. If you add indigo boiling, you can dye it into a dark blue-green color.
    2.  Sesame Stalk Dyeing: Burn the lower half of the sesame stalks into black ash, grind it into a fine powder, mix the fine powder with water, then boil it in water to dye gray cloth.
    3.  Soot Dyeing: Ordinary soot is pine soot. Mix the soot with wine and water, then boil it and cook the cloth in it. Finally, take it out and pound or shake it to make it gray.
    4.  Black Sludge Dyeing: Scoop up the black sludge from the bottom of a long-standing water pit, apply it to the new cloth, dry it in the sun, and then wash it two or three times with cold water. After drying in the sun, it will become bluish-gray.

  　Several Methods for Dyeing Green
    1.  Green Branch Dyeing: The green branch is a clump of shrubs, commonly known as "Tiger Wood." The outer skin is white with needles, the inner skin is green, and the leaves are similar to pomegranate leaves. Dyeing method: After the late autumn harvest, cut it into small pieces and put it in a pot to boil. When it boils into a green soup, put the cloth in to boil, take it out to dry in the shade and then boil it again. After boiling several times, it will become green.
    2.  Pagoda Tree Bud, Turmeric, and "Pin Green" Dyeing: Use unopened pagoda tree flower buds, and cook them together with turmeric and "Pin Green" to dye an olive green color.
    3.  Tender Tip Rubbing of Vitex Negundo: Strip off the tender tips of Vitex Negundo and boil them in water to dye green.

  　Several Methods for Dyeing Yellow
    1.  Pagoda Flower Dyeing: Dry unopened pagoda flowers in the shade. When dyeing, boil the pagoda flowers to make a soup, then dissolve alum in boiling water and add it to the soup. Then, wet the white cloth thoroughly and pound it evenly, put it into the dye water to dye it, and it will become yellow in one go (if there is starch on the new cloth, it must be washed off before it can be colored). For 100 square feet, use four taels of alum and ten taels of pagoda buds.
    2.  Amur Cork Tree Dyeing: Cut the roots of the Amur cork tree into small pieces, put them in a pot and boil them into yellow water, add alum (two taels of alum for 100 feet of cloth), and put the cloth in to dye it yellow.
    3.  Apricot Tree Root Dyeing: Boil apricot tree roots in water to make yellow soup, and put the cloth in to dye it.
    4.  Chinese Mahogany Bark Dyeing: Same as above.
    5.  Oenanthe Thomsonii Root and Apricot Bud Dyeing: Boil Oenanthe Thomsonii root and apricot buds together to make a soup, and the dyeing method is the same as above.

　  Grass Green Dyeing
    To dye a hundred feet of cloth, use three taels of acorn shells and four qian of black alum. Dye it into a light gray color according to the method of dyeing gray cloth. After it dries, use ten taels of pagoda buds and four taels of alum. Redye it once according to the method of dyeing yellow cloth, and it will become grass green.

　　群众的染色法介绍
  　怎样染灰黄绿色
    马琳
    现在外来颜料太贵，边府号召发展本地颜料，土法染织。马琳同志把武乡三四年来群众试用有效的染法寄来，兹分期刊载，希望各地读者继续搜集寄来。——编者
　　　　      
  　染灰色的几种方法
    一、橡壳染法：以一百方尺布为例，用十二两橡壳，加入一桶多水来煮。煮好后，将布预先泡湿放入黑水内煮。再把一两七钱黑矾，用开水冲开，放入锅内，颜色就上在布上。如果再加上煮蓝，即可染成为双青色。
    二、芝麻秸染法：把芝麻秸下半段烧成黑灰，碾成细面，加水将细面拌匀，再用水煮滚即可染灰布。
    三、烟煤染法：普通所说烟煤就是松烟。把烟煤加酒、水和好，然后熬开，将布煮入。最后取出捶或摔，即成灰色。
    四、黑污泥染法：将日久的水坑底下的黑污泥捞上来，涂在新布上面，经日光晒干后，再用冷水洗两三遍，晒干就成青灰色。
  　绿色的几种染法
    一、绿枝染法：绿枝是丛生的灌木，俗名叫老虎柴。外皮白色有针，里皮绿色，叶子和石榴叶相似。染法：在大秋后割下，裁成碎段，放锅里煮。煮成绿汤时，将布投内煮，取出阴干再煮，连煮数次，即成绿色。
    二、槐子、姜黄、品绿染法：用尚未放开槐花圪瘩，与姜黄、品绿同煮，可染成油绿色。
    三、荆条嫩尖的揉染法：将荆条的嫩尖捋下，用水煮汤，可以染绿色。
  　黄色的几种染法
    一、槐花染法：把未开的槐花阴干。染时将槐花煮汤，再把白矾用滚水冲开入内，然后将白布湿透捶匀，放进色水内染之，一次就成黄色（若新布上有浆子要洗掉才能着色）。用量以一百方尺计算，用白矾四两，槐子十两。
    二、黄柏染法：把黄柏根切成碎片，放入锅内煮成黄水，把白矾加入（一百尺布用白矾二两）将布放入染即成。
    三、杏树根染法：将杏树根用水煮成黄汤，将布投入染即成。
    四、香椿树皮染法：同上。
    五、黄芹根与杏芽染法：把黄芹根和杏芽和在一起煮汤，染法同上。
　  草绿色染法
    如染百尺布，用橡壳三两，黑矾四钱，照染灰色布法染成浅灰，干后再用槐子十两，白矾四两，照染黄色布法重染一遍即成。
