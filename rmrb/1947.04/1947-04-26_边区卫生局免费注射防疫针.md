　　Border Region Health Bureau Offers Free Vaccinations
    [This newspaper] To prevent spring epidemics as early as possible, the Border Region Health Bureau has purchased a large number of typhoid, cholera vaccines and smallpox vaccine. Starting from April 12th, the Handan International Peace Hospital began vaccinating and providing epidemic prevention for government and civilian workers and nearby residents. Vaccinations are free of charge, and smallpox vaccination is only half price, 100 yuan. Comrade Zhu Lian, the person in charge of the bureau, is extremely concerned about mass epidemic prevention, and personally promotes the importance of epidemic prevention and vaccination to the masses in front of the outpatient department every day. The bureau has also organized an epidemic prevention team to go to the countryside to vaccinate and prevent epidemics for the masses outside of daily work and during Sunday's rest and production time.
    [This newspaper] On April 14th and 15th, Xingtai County (new district) held a doctor's meeting, which solved the doctors' difficulties in practicing medicine and ideological obstacles, and improved their enthusiasm. The eighteen doctors and five veterinarians who attended the meeting all believed that the lack of labor delayed production. Some doctors had misunderstandings about how to serve the masses. Western doctor Mr. Li Linshu said: "I treat the masses to serve the people. When I prescribe medicine, I declare that it is free, but when my stock of medicine is used up, I will not buy any more. It is useless for me to see a doctor without medicine, so I have not been practicing medicine much lately." During the discussion, everyone cited Mr. Guo Jingmei of the Dongbaishan Medical Cooperative as an example for study. Guo is 59 years old. He works hard and endures hardship to treat the masses. He arrives whenever someone calls him. When he is not treating illnesses, he goes to the fields to produce. Last spring, he moved the people of Nanbaishan to say: "Mr. Guo's skills are still worth more than one of our laborers!" Therefore, the masses voluntarily cultivated his land for him. No matter what difficulties he has, they can be solved as long as he brings them up. When hoeing seedlings, he didn't have time and was embarrassed to say so, but the masses automatically hoeed for him. Mr. Guo said: "The masses are always watching. As long as you sincerely serve the people, the people will naturally solve your difficulties." Everyone believes that Mr. Guo is a role model in this doctor's meeting. After the meeting, everyone cheered up. Veterinarian Mr. Sun Jingkui from Beigang West did not go home after the meeting, but first went to Xingtai City to buy medicine to open a veterinary medicine village cooperative. (Zheng Yi)

　　边区卫生局免费注射防疫针
    【本报讯】边区卫生局，为及早预防春疫起见，购来大批伤寒、霍乱防疫苗及牛痘苗，已于四月十二日起开始由邯郸国际和平医院为政民工作人员及附近居民群众进行种痘防疫，注射防疫针一律免费，种牛痘只收半价一百元。该局负责人朱琏同志对群众防疫尤极关心，每日在门诊部门前亲向群众宣传防疫种痘之重要。该局并组织防疫队，于每日工作之外及星期日的休息生产时间下乡为群众种痘防疫。
    【本报讯】邢台县（新区）四月十四、十五两天，开了个医生会，解决了医生们行医困难与思想障碍，提高了积极性。到会的十八位医生，五位兽医都认为劳力缺乏，耽误生产。有的医生在对如何为群众服务上有误解，西医李麟书先生说：“我给群众看病为的是给人民服务，我用药时便声明不要钱，但我所存的一点药品用完了，就不再置药了。我看了病没药不顶事，因此近来便不大行医了。”讨论中大家举出东柏山医药合作社郭景美先生为例来研究。郭已年五十九岁。为群众治病，吃苦耐劳，啥时有人叫，啥时就赶到。不治病时下地生产，去年春天感动了南柏山的群众说：“人家郭老先生的本事还顶不住咱们一个劳力呀？”因此群众自愿给他代耕。他不论有啥困难，只要提出就能解决。锄苗时，他没有时间，也不好意思说，但群众又自动的给他锄了。郭老先生说：“群众谁也未闲着眼，只要真心为人民服务，人民自然就会替他解决困难。”大家认为郭老先生是这次医生会中的榜样。会后，大家提起了劲头，北岗西兽医孙景魁先生散会不回家，先进邢台市去买药开办兽医药村合作社。（正一）
