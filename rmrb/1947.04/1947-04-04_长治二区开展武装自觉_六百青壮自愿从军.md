　　Armed Consciousness Campaign Launched in Changzhi Second District
    Six Hundred Young Men Voluntarily Enlist
    [This newspaper's Changzhi dispatch] Based on the class consciousness ideological movement, the Second District of Changzhi successively launched an armed consciousness ideological movement. The masses all developed hatred from the landlord class in their own villages to the root cause, Chiang Kai-shek. Each village studied whether the landlords had transformed, thereby recognizing that Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan were the old roots of the landlords. If the old roots are not eradicated, they cannot live. Su Dian's Erzi said: "Whether the landlord's heart is dead or alive depends on the life or death of Chiang Kai-shek. If Chiang Kai-shek moves, they will also move. If Chiang Kai-shek is driven back, they will give up." The slogan automatically raised by the masses was: "If you want to turn over completely, thoroughly dig out the old roots." "If you want to dig out the old roots, quickly join the army." Based on this idea, six hundred and twenty-seven young men in the district signed up to join the army to dig out the old roots within three days. Zhang Zhaogen, a liberated woman hero from Yuanjia Village, personally sent her child to the front line. New soldiers from Nandong swore at a mass meeting: "I will never go home if Chiang Kai-shek is not eliminated." Then they discussed who they were joining the army for, who the Eighth Route Army was for, and how we treated the families of soldiers and martyrs in the past, and how we cared for the army. They reflected on supporting the army and giving preferential treatment, and selected 161 models of supporting the army and giving preferential treatment, and 131 model military families.

　　长治二区开展武装自觉
    六百青壮自愿从军
    【本报长治讯】长治二区在阶级自觉思想运动基础上，接续的开展了武装自觉思想运动，群众都从仇恨本村地主阶级进而仇恨到老根蒋介石。各村都研究了地主是否转变了，从而认识到蒋介石、阎锡山是地主的老根，刨不掉老根不能活。苏店二子说：“地主心死心活是看蒋介石的死活，蒋介石动他们也要动，把蒋介石打退了他们也就死心啦。”群众自动提的口号是：“要想翻透身，彻底刨老根”。“要想刨老根，快快去参军。”在这个思想基础上，全区三天内六百二十七个青壮年报名参军刨老根。原家庄翻身女英雄张招根亲自送孩子上前线，南董新战士在群众会上宣誓：“消灭不了蒋介石誓不回家。”接着又讨论他们参军为谁，八路军为谁，咱们过去对抗属优待怎样，对军队关心怎样，反省了拥军优抗，并评选出拥军优抗模范一百六十一名，模范军属一百三十一户。
