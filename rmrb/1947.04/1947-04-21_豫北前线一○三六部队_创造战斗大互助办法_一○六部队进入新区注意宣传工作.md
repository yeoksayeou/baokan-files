[Reported from the Yubei Frontline on the 19th by our newspaper] The People's Liberation Army Unit 1036 on the Yubei Frontline launched a large-scale mutual aid movement during the Jixian South battle. The seventh and eighth companies of the unit were responsible for the main attack, and many comrades from the ninth company, the third battalion of the second echelon, and the directly subordinate units of the regiment, voluntarily ran to the front line to transport bombs and bullets, and returned with stretchers, spreading news of victory from the front. After the battle, the seventh company captured less equipment, so the eighth company gave two of their four captured machine guns to the seventh company. This battle mutual aid has been very effective: (1) Reducing the burden on the front-line troops, allowing them to focus on combat. (2) Front-line and second-echelon troops relaying information, boosting morale. (3) Promoting the spirit of unity and fraternity between the units. (4) Solving the difficulties of front-line rescue. This movement is now rapidly spreading to other units of the department. (Ping Zhu)

[Reported from the Yubei Frontline on the 18th by our newspaper] After entering the new area, the directly subordinate units of Unit 106 paid great attention to propaganda work. New slogans filled the roads they marched on and the villages they stayed in, large and small. Section Chief Cao, with some young comrades, climbed the high tower in ×× village amidst the flying sand and dust, and wrote "Long Live the Communist Party" on the tower wall. Below the tower was a senior elementary school, filled with Chiang's deceitful enslavement slogans. A group led by Section Chief Liu went inside and filled the walls with our policies and propositions, such as providing relief to children out of school, opposing Chiang Kai-shek's enslavement education, and ending Chiang's dictatorial rule. The school was immediately transformed. One night, the troops marched urgently through the wind and sand to ×× village. Without resting, everyone wielded their brushes and wrote slogans on the walls of the streets. Minister Li personally got involved, getting covered in white ash, working very enthusiastically. Director Ge of the political department of the department convened a meeting of all ministers before the march, calling on everyone to launch a slogan-writing campaign. Under his call, the propaganda work of Unit 106 was even more vigorously promoted.

    创造战斗大互助办法
    一○六部队进入新区注意宣传工作
    【本报豫北前线十九日电】豫北前线人民解放军一○三六部队在汲（县）南战斗中展开大互助运动。该部七、八连担任主攻，第二梯队的九连、三营及团直属队的许多同志，均自动地跑到前线运送炸弹和子弹，回来时运回彩号，并传播前线胜利消息。战斗结束，七连缴获较少，八连即将其缴获的四挺机枪送给二连两挺。这种战斗大互助作用甚大：（１）减轻最前线部队的负担，使他们安心作战。（２）前线与第二梯队互相传递消息，鼓舞士气。（３）发扬了各部队之间的团结友爱精神。（４）解决了前线救护的困难。现此运动正在该部其他单位迅速普及中。（平铸）
    【本报豫北前线十八日电】一○六部直属队进入新区后，非常注意宣传工作。在他们的行军路上和驻过的村庄，大小街道都布满了新标语。曹科长带着小同志在大风沙漫天飞舞中，登上××村的高塔，把“共产党万岁”写在塔壁上。塔下边是一所高级小学，里面尽是蒋贼骗人的奴化标语，刘科长的一组进到里边，把我们的政策、主张，如救济失学儿童、反对蒋介石奴化教育、结束蒋贼独夫统治等标语写了满墙。学校顿时改观。某夜部队冒风沙急行军，到了××村，不等休息，大家就挥动大笔，在满街的墙壁上写标语。李部长亲自动手，弄的满身白灰，干的非常起劲。该部政治部阁主任在行军之前曾召集各部长开会，号召大家开展写标语运动。在他的号召下，更加有力的推动了一○六部的宣传工作。
