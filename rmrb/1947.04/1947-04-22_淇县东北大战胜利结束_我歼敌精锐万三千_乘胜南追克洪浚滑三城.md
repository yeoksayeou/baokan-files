Xinhua News Agency, Northern Henan Front, urgent telegram, 20th: The great victory in Northeast Qixian concluded victoriously at 4:00 PM on the 18th with the brilliant result of annihilating two brigades of Chiang's troops. This time, Chiang's troops, with a force of five brigades including two brigades of the 66th Division, the 49th Brigade of the 27th Division (i.e., the Second Rapid Column), one regiment of the 40th Division, the 122nd Brigade of the 41st Division, and one regiment of the 127th Brigade of the 47th Division, attacked north from the Qixian-Daokou line on the 14th, and the entire two brigades of the 32nd Division attacked west from the Junxian Baisi and Naitoushan line on their right flank, attempting to relieve the siege of Tangyin. General Liu Bocheng's People's Liberation Army launched an attack on the night of the 16th (previously mistakenly reported as the night of the 15th), encircling the enemy in the area northeast of Qixian and north of Daokou. After fierce fighting until the 18th, they first annihilated the entire 49th Brigade (Second Rapid Column), including brigade commander Li Shouzhen, deputy brigade commander (name to be verified), and more than 5,000 men below the regimental commander. Chiang's army's entire line immediately showed signs of wavering. The People's Liberation Army took advantage of the victory and annihilated the entire 596th Regiment of the 199th Brigade of the 66th Division, the entire 379th Regiment of the 127th Brigade of the 47th Division, and part of the 316th Regiment of the 40th Division. The defeated enemy, unable to withstand the attacks, fled in disarray towards Junxian. The People's Liberation Army then took advantage of the victory and recovered the city of Junxian on the morning of the 19th. The pseudo-Sun Dianying troops trapped in Tangyin have become turtles in a jar. Preliminary investigations have revealed that a total of more than 9,000 Chiang's troops, including brigade commander Li Shouzhen, were captured, more than 4,000 were killed or wounded, and a large amount of equipment was seized, which is currently being inventoried.

Shaanxi Broadcasting Station, broadcast at 7:00 PM on the 20th: After General Liu Bocheng's troops annihilated two brigades of the enemy northeast of Qixian, the remaining enemy fled east of the Wei River towards Junxian, Huaxian, Daokou Town, and other places. The Northern Henan People's Liberation Army took advantage of the victory to pursue and recover Junxian city on the morning of the 19th, and then recovered Huaxian city and Daokou Town on the same day. Another unit of the People's Liberation Army went south along the Pinghan Railway, approaching Qixian city. Chiang's troops fled at the mere sight of them, and Qixian was immediately recovered.

This newspaper, Northern Henan Front, 18th: This newspaper reporter reports on the situation of General Liu Bocheng's ever-victorious army severely attacking the enemy's tank forces south of Yigou, stating: On the 10th, the always-defeated General Wang Zhonglian commanded six brigades, with the rapid Second Column as the vanguard, and fiercely attacked Yigou, attempting to relieve the siege of Tangyin. The Third Company of a certain regiment of Liu Bocheng's Field Army guarded the position south of Yigou, and the Second and Sixth Companies fiercely attacked the enemy on the flanks. The enemy first bombarded our position with artillery fire, and hundreds of infantry slowly advanced under the cover of seven tanks and smoke screens. The leading two tanks rushed straight into our army's position. Mutual Aid Group leader Yang Dacheng waited for them to approach and then concentrated his hand grenades, destroying one tank, which overturned into the ditch. At this time, the tanks adopted the tactic of ramming, with three tanks arranged in a "品" shape, crossing our army's fortifications and breaking into our army's position. The soldiers of the group immediately dug new fortifications to monitor the tanks' actions. At this time, our artillery cooperated with the group to fiercely bombard the tanks. Wherever the tanks charged, the artillery fired, and finally repelled the tanks. At the same time, about a battalion of enemy troops on the enemy's right flank, under the cover of tanks, attacked the position of the Sixth Company of our × unit. The company calmly fired, destroying three tanks, capturing one, killing more than 600 enemy soldiers, and completely repelling the enemy by the afternoon. The enemy's advance was slow, but their retreat was fast, and they immediately fled back south of the Qi River, a total of more than 60 li.

This newspaper, Taiyue, 20th: In the face of the powerful offensive of the People's Liberation Army in Southern Shanxi, Chiang's troops in Linfen are in extreme terror and chaos. Before the 10th, Yan Xishan hurriedly transported a large amount of materials stored there; on the 20th, Chiang's 30th Brigade hurriedly transferred the 90th Regiment stationed in Zhaocheng and the 89th Regiment in Hongdong to Linfen. Except for two battalions left in Hongdong for defense, only a small number of special agents were left in Zhaocheng. In Linfen city, laborers and sacks were conscripted; except for the Xiaonanmen gate, all other city gates were blocked with sandbags, martial law was implemented, and merchants were prohibited from entering or leaving.
