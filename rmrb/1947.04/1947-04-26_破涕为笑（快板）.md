　　The Ninth Squad's artillery team, met a truly pitiful old woman, leading a pair of thin children, coming to the landlord's house to beg for food, the landlord's heart filled with annoyance, "Get out, get out," chasing them away.
　　The old woman began to lament her suffering, speaking to our artillery team: "I don't have a single plot of land, not a single room in the house, begging for food during the day, spinning thread at night, struggling all year round, with little to eat and nothing to wear, the family has no way out, the sorrow made the old man hang himself from the beam! ......" Speaking to this point, tears fell, and everyone felt a pang of sadness.
　　Artillery squad leader Chen Congfu, lowered his head and went to the bedside without a word, took out a pair of pants from his bag, and said: "Old woman, listen to me, these are some civilian clothes pants, mend them up and you can still wear them. We are the Eighth Route Army, dedicated to helping the poor stand up; we will defeat the traitor Chiang Kai-shek, and protect you old folks in peace."
　　The squad leader loved the people like his own parents, and the two soldiers were influenced. Xu Dejin and Liang Waixiao, each took out two pieces of clothing, the clothes piled up like a small hill, wiping away tears and revealing smiles. Just as they were about to leave, Captain Zhang Xianglin arrived. The old woman told the story again, and his heart softened as soon as he heard it, he immediately reached into his pocket, and gave the old woman five hundred yuan.
　　The old woman was moved in her heart, walking and talking: "I burn incense and pray all day long, but still have little to eat and nothing to wear. Begging for food in other villages in winter, the 'Nationalist Army' soldiers stopped me at the sentry post, I slept in the wild all night, frozen and shivering all over. This time I met the Eighth Route Army, giving me clothes and money, you are truly my saviors, I will remember you for the rest of my life!"

　　破涕为笑（快板）
    长沙部队  贺增德
    九小队小炮班，遇见一个老太太真可怜，领了一对瘦小孩，房东家里来要饭，房东一见心头恼，“出去，出去，”往外撵。
    老太太开口来诉苦，对着咱们小炮班：“俺地没一垅，房子没一间，白天去要饭，黑夜纺线线，一年混到头，少吃没有穿，家中几口无办法，愁的老汉吊死在梁间！………”说到这里双泪下，大家听了心眼儿酸。
    小炮班长陈从富，低头不语到床边，包袱里拿出一条裤，叫声：“老太太听我言，这是一条便衣裤，修补修补还能穿。我们就是八路军，专帮穷人把身翻；打垮了卖国贼蒋介石，保护你老人家得平安。”
    班长爱民如爹娘，两个战士受影响。徐得金和梁歪小，每人拿出衣两件，衣裳闹了一谷堆，擦干眼泪露笑脸。正要说着往外走，队长张祥林到跟前。老太太把事情说一遍，他一听到心肠软，立刻插手到腰间，给了老太太五百元。
    老太太心中受感动，一面走着一面谈：“成天烧香又祷告，还是少吃没有穿。冬天要饭到外村，‘遭殃军’站岗把俺拦，野地里睡了一整夜，冻得俺浑身光打战。这会儿碰上八路军，又给衣裳又给钱，你们真是救命人，一辈子我也记心间！”
