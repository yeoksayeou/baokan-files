    Southern Hebei Landlords Evade Re-examination
    Cadres and Masses with Sharp Eyes Expose Conspiracy
    [This newspaper's Southern Hebei dispatch, 20th] In many places, landlords are playing tricks, attempting to evade re-examination. Duan Zhoutu, a landlord in × Village, Third District of Pingxiang, secretly scattered and buried his clothes and valuables, more than thirty large bundles, in the fields and threshing grounds at night. After discovery, all were dug out, totaling over one million yuan in value. Qin Longyun, a local tyrant and landlord in Qinjiaying, Fourth District of Chengci, used money to bribe a village cadre to hide six bundles for him and, with the "enlightened" face of a "self-reporter," fabricated a story that an honest peasant, Shen Baoni, had hidden 1,500 jin of cotton for him, attempting to avoid the truth with a false story and shift the blame onto others. After the district cadre investigated and clarified the truth, the landlord's conspiracy was exposed, and the target of struggle was directed at the feudal landlord. A landlord in Houting Village, Third District of Qinghe, personally burned five of his own houses to show that he was bankrupt due to the disaster, attempting to avoid being struggled against. During the compensation for losses to middle peasants during the inspection movement, Liu Huanzhang impersonated a middle peasant and even returned the property that was to be confiscated from him, causing the masses to cry out injustice. After investigation, the district cadre supported the masses and reclaimed it from the landlord.

    冀南地主逃避复查
    干群眼明揭露阴谋
    【本报冀南二十日电】许多地方的地主玩弄阴谋，企图逃避复查。平乡三区×村地主段周土将他的衣服细软三十几个大包袱，在深夜偷偷分散埋藏到地里、场里，后经发觉，统统掘出，计价值百余万元。成磁四区秦家营恶霸地主秦龙云，用金钱收买一个村干替他藏了六个包袱，并以“自报”的“开明”面目，捏造老实农民沈保妮藏他一千五百斤棉花，想以假避真，嫁罪于人。经区干查明真象，揭破地主阴谋，斗争目标才转向封建地主身上。清河三区后丁村地主亲手焚烧自己房子五间，以遭灾表示自己破产，企图避免被斗。检查运动中补偿中农损失时，刘换章冒充中农，竟将清算他的财物退回，群众莫不喊冤，经查出后，区干给群众撑腰，重新从地主手中夺回。
