　　Hua Zhong Female Militia Member, Xi Qiao
　　Xi Qiao is a member of the joint defense team who has been steadfastly working on the banks of the Beida Zong River in Xinghua. She used to work in the Hua Zhong Military Factory. In her spare time, she practiced martial arts and became skilled at using grenades and shooting. She always carries two grenades on her waist and a rifle on her shoulder. She can’t remember how many times she fought as a guerrilla, but in short, she fought whenever the enemy came to the countryside. Once, she and two cadres drove away ten "Homecoming Corps" members with two rifles. She cooperated with the mobile detachment to attack Xilu Village and Gu Zhao Village. She even captured one "Homecoming Corps" member and wounded a Chiang soldier. They often teased the Chiang Kai-shek troops like in hide-and-seek using a few guns. Once, in Hexing Township, more than a dozen "Homecoming Corps" fired more than 300 bullets but failed to catch any of them.
　　The "Homecoming Corps" wanted to capture this female militia member who was good at fighting. In the first month of the lunar year, the enemy came to the village and caught her; however, as soon as the enemy turned around, she immediately slipped behind them, threw out two grenades, and left. In the second month of the lunar year, she was captured by the enemy again. After being tied up and beaten, they asked her to hand over her weapons. She said, "A tree that grows for a thousand years will still be cut down, and a person who lives for a thousand years will be buried in the ground. I don't have any guns to give you, and I am the one who fights as a guerrilla." The enemy beat her again. She shouted loudly, "What does it matter if you catch a few women? You can't bring down the Communist Party." The enemy was at their wit's end. Her sister came to visit her in prison, crying. She secretly said, "Send my gun, grenades, and gun oil to the political commissar. These are revolutionary weapons, and it won't be in vain for us sisters to suffer." Because she was a woman, the villagers secretly bailed her out. As soon as she got home, she went to the district. Someone advised her, "Xi Qiao, don't do it." She smiled and said, "I am going in a good direction." She also said, "I will do it to the end and drive out the reactionaries. I also want to go back to the factory and work."

　　华中女民兵喜巧
    喜巧是坚持在兴化北大纵河畔的联防队队员，过去在华中军工厂做工，闲下来练武，学得一手好榴弹，枪也打得不错。她腰上老是插着两个榴弹，肩上背一支长枪。打游击的次数，自己也记不清，总之，敌人下乡就打。一次，她和两个干部用两支长枪打走了十个“还乡团”员。她配合过行动大队打西鲁庄、顾赵庄，还活捉一个“还乡团”员，打伤一个蒋军。她们常用几支枪逗着蒋伪捉迷藏。一次，在合兴乡十几个“还乡团”打了三百多发子弹也没有捉到他们中的一个。
    “还乡团”要捉这一个打仗厉害的女民兵。正月里，敌人上庄把她逮住了；可是，敌人一转身，她马上溜到后面，撩出两个榴弹后走了。二月里，她又被敌人捉到，绑起来吊打以后，要她交出武器，她说：“树长千年也是斩，人活千岁土里埋，要枪没得，游击是我打的。”敌人又吊打她。她大声喊：“揪个把女的算什么？共产党你攀不倒的。”敌人无计可施。她姊姊哭着来探牢，她偷偷说：“你把我的枪和榴弹还有擦枪油都送到政委那里，这是革命武器，也不枉我们姊妹一伤。”因为她是个女的，庄上人偷偷的把她保出来。她一到家，就上区里去了。有人劝她：“喜巧，不要干吧。”她笑笑说：“我是往好处走啊。”她又说：“我是干到底，把反动派打出去，我还要进厂做工呢。”
