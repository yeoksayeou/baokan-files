    How to Launch a Large-Scale Production Campaign
    Jian Fu
    Based on the actual situation in Licheng, we offer the following suggestions on how to specifically carry out the large-scale production campaign for your reference:
    I. The mobilization and launch of the large-scale production campaign should also boldly concentrate the demands of the broad masses. It should begin with a preliminary mobilization by clarifying the thinking of the peasants after their emancipation, followed by freely accepting the opinions of the masses by inspiring them to recognize the new situation of labor shortage this year, checking and rectifying mutual aid, and accepting the demands of the masses to expand mutual aid organizations and absorb all labor and livestock, so that this year's mutual aid organizations can be established from the very beginning on a fully democratic and conscious basis. At the same time, pay attention to mastering the principles of combining agricultural and sideline production with support for the front and participation in the war, unified wages, payment by work, equal distribution of dividends, unified and clear division of labor, and accurate calculation of large-scale labor exchange. From the rectification of mutual aid, quickly formulate short-term plans, combine them with technical research, and take practical action. From the actual development of the movement, continue to firmly grasp the in-depth mobilization of thought, overcome wasteful and negative ideas such as "cutting leeks" (a metaphor for short-sighted gains), widely publicize the new direction of getting rich through labor, and formulate annual plans for cultivating three and saving one (that is, cultivating three years' worth of crops and saving the equivalent of one year's worth of crops) from typical households to groups, and even the entire village (especially helping hero banners, newly emancipated peasants, and family members of those fighting at the front).
    II. However, in order to thoroughly complete the final historical task of land reform, promote the production enthusiasm of poor and landless peasants, and earnestly pay attention to improving the relationship between cadres and the masses, so as to concentrate greater efforts on carrying out this year's large-scale production, we should, in the development of the production movement, earnestly implement the verification of land and distribution of fruits in mutual aid, and implement the completion of "land to the tiller." According to recent investigations and studies on the changes in class status after land reform in various villages in Licheng, in some villages, although poor peasants have also risen to become middle peasants, in reality, the land they own is generally still below the village average, resulting in insufficient emancipation of the poor peasants and affecting the exertion of their production enthusiasm. This should arouse our vigilance and attention, and we should conduct in-depth investigations in conjunction with production and solve it, but absolutely not in a disruptive way, but rather by solving individual cases. In order to truly restore and unleash the production enthusiasm of poor and landless peasants and all peasants, and to truly unite cadres and the masses as one, and launch this year's large-scale production movement in great strides.

    如何开展大生产运动
    健夫
    我们根据黎城的实际情况，对如何具体开展大生产运动，提出如下意见，以供参考：
    一、关于大生产运动之发动与开展，亦应大胆集中广大群众之要求，应从明确农民翻身后的思想进行初步发动入手，紧接着从启发群众认识今年劳力缺乏的新情况，放手接受群众意见，检查与整顿互助，并接受群众扩大互助组织吸收一切劳畜力的要求，使今年的互助组织，一开始就建立在充分民主自觉的基础上。同时注意农副业支差参战结合、统一工资、按活计工、等价分红、统一明确分工、精确计算大变工几个原则之掌握。从互助整顿中，迅速订出短期计划，结合技术研究，实际行动起来。从实际运动开展中，继续抓紧思想之深入发动，克服割韭菜等浪费消极思想，普遍宣传劳动发家的新方向，由典型户到组，以至全村订出全年耕三余一计划（特别帮助英雄旗帜及新翻身与抗干属）。
    二、但是为了彻底完成土地改革的最后历史任务、发扬贫雇农生产积极性，并切实注意改善干群的关系，以便更集中大力开展今年大生产；所以应该在生产运动之开展中，认真在互助中，贯彻查田查分果实，贯彻完成耕者有其田。根据最近黎城各村土地改革阶级变化之调查研究，有些村子，贫农虽也上升为中农，但实际上土地一般还在全村平均土地之下，致使贫农翻身不够，影响他们生产热情的发挥，应引起我们的警惕与注意，并结合生产深入进行调查，加以解决，但绝不是大动，而是以个别方式解决。以便真正做到恢复发挥贫雇农及全体农民之生产热情，及干群真正团结一致，大踏步的开展今年大规模的生产运动。
