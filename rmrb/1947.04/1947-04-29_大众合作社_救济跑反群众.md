Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 26th: The Dazhong Cooperative in Huangqiao, Taixing, continues to innovate during the anti-"mopping-up" operations. Chiang's troops often divide into more than a dozen routes to hunt down the masses. The people here thoroughly empty their homes and fields, collectively fleeing. Whenever they arrive at a place, the cooperative sells the stored grain to the refugees at low prices, solving their livelihood problems. Due to the looting by Chiang's troops, the cooperative has listed relief work as one of its businesses. It divides the disaster victims into several groups according to their place of residence, and each group establishes a branch cooperative. The head office distributes goods to the branch cooperatives with special discounts, allowing the disaster victims to rely on the branch cooperatives' profits to make a living. This not only solves the livelihood of the disaster victims, but also makes the cooperative more dispersed, easier to maintain, and broadens the scope of its business. In order to cope with the guerrilla environment, the cooperative has created a method of periodic transactions, that is, customers order goods in advance, agreeing on the time, place, and date. The cooperative sends people to carry the goods to conduct transactions. If the customer's residence is not far away, the cooperative only sends people to deliver them, so even in a severe environment, it can still operate as usual, which is convenient for customers. When the cooperative's business was developed, the scope was expanded to the Taizhou "Jingjiang" area.

    救济跑反群众
    【新华社华中二十六日电】泰兴黄桥大众合作社在反“清剿”中续有新创造。蒋军常分十几路兜捕群众。该地人民彻底空舍清野，集体跑反，每到一地，该社即将所藏粮食低价卖于跑反群众，解决生活问题。由于蒋军洗劫，该社即将救济工作列为业务之一。将灾民依据其住地，分成若干小组，每组成立一个分社，总社将货物发给分社，定有特别折扣，使灾民们依靠分社盈利过活。这样既解决了灾民生活，同时使该社更形分散，便于坚持，营业范围更加广泛。该社为应付游击环境，创造定期交易办法，即顾客预先向其定货，约定时间地点日期，该社派人携货前往进行交易。如顾客住地不远，该社只派人专送，故虽在严重环境中，亦能照常营业，顾客称便。该社在营业发达时，范围曾扩至泰州“靖江”一带。
