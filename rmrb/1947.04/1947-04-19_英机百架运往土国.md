　　Hundreds of British Planes Shipped to Turkey
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 15th -- TASS reports: According to the London Chronicle, hundreds of British fighter planes are now flying to Turkey. These include Spitfire and Mosquito fighter planes. These planes are part of the 500 purchased by the Turkish government from Britain. The decision to allow Turkey to purchase the planes is believed to be directly related to President Truman's recommendation that the United States lend Turkey $25 million. Furthermore, Turkish air force personnel have been trained by the British Royal Air Force since 1941.

　　英机百架运往土国
    【新华社陕北十五日电】塔斯社讯：据伦敦纪事报报导：英国成百的战斗机，现正飞往土境。其中包括喷火式和蚊式等战斗机。这些飞机是土耳其政府向英国所购五百架中之一部。允许土耳其购买飞机的决定，咸信与杜鲁门总统建议美国对土耳其二千五百万借款一事，有直接联系。又：土耳其空军人员从一九四一年起就由英国皇家空军训练。
