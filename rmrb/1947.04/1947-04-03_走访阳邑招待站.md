　　Visiting the Yangyi Reception Station
    Qi Zhi
    Recently, I came to Yangyi on official business and suddenly saw a tall and spacious shop on the north side of the main street. The snow-white walls and clear portraits of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu attracted me. I stepped onto the stone steps and saw a large wooden sign with yellow background and black characters hanging outside the door, which read: "Wuan County Seventh District Yangyi Town Reception and Transit Station."

    I walked into the door with a sense of novelty and visited a receptionist comrade in a black jacket and trousers, who was sitting on a long bench next to two tables in the center of the room. The east room had a white cloth curtain, and "Rice Exchange" was written on the wall. The door of the back room on the west side had "Female Comrades Dormitory" written on it. Under the front window was a stove platform with three iron pots of different sizes connected together, with steam rising from the large pot on top. The water tank was full of clear water, and the chopping board was filled with knives, spoons, bowls, chopsticks, and other cooking utensils. From this room, you could also see the backyard: five north-facing rooms, with white cloth curtains hanging on the middle door; two rows of open houses with sixteen or seventeen rooms on the east and west sides, all with stone troughs; at the south end of the west row of houses were stacks of dry grass bundles; two jujube-red horses were eating grass.

    As I looked around, I chatted with him, asking when the station was opened. According to the answer, it has been more than half a month. It is specially designed to receive passing soldiers and staff, providing rest and accommodation at any time, and in addition to rice coupons and forage coupons can be exchanged at any time, all other water and fire are supplied free of charge.

    This kind of reception station, so convenient for marching, reminded me of the "military stations" set up by the public in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region in the past. But the receptionist at this station is an elected ordinary person. So I asked him, "Then, where does all the station's expenses come from?"

    The one who told me the most details about this issue was Secretary Li of the town government. It turned out that the system of this reception station had been in place for several years. In the past, it was located on Erdao Street, far from the main road, making it inconvenient for guests to find, and it was only responsible for finding shops and exchanging rice. The reception work was the responsibility of the shops in rotation. However, the shops were often crowded with people, and military and political comrades would have no room if they came late. The shops felt a lot of difficulties and troubles; it was also difficult for those marching to get a comfortable place to eat and sleep. Therefore, a plan that was convenient for both the military and the people was written, specifically merging the reception station with the shops, and moving it next to the main road. The elected stationmaster and Liu Dong and other five people are solely responsible, directly under the leadership of the town government, and its expenses are made up of the profits of the 240,000 yuan fund pooled by the shopkeepers of the whole street, and are responsible for replacing and transferring military and political comrades (in consultation with the town government, rotating assignments to each household). Now that it has just been established, there are no less than forty or fifty people staying overnight every day, and the houses are not enough, so preparations are being made to renovate the east and west open houses into dormitories.

### 走访阳邑招待站

　　走访阳邑招待站
    奇之
    最近因公来阳邑，忽然看到大街路北的一座高大而宽敞的店房，雪白的墙壁和鲜明的毛主席朱总司令像片吸住了我。我踏上石阶才看到门外挂的一块黄底黑字大木牌，上面写着：“武安县第七区阳邑镇招待转运站”。
    我怀着新奇的心情走进门去，访问该站一位身着黑袄裤的招待员同志，他就坐在房子正中两张桌子旁的长凳上。房子的东间挂着白布帘，墙上挂着“兑米处”。西头后套间的门上挂着“女同志宿舍”。前窗下是座一连三口大小不同铁锅的炉灶台，头上的一口大锅上，正冒着水蒸汽。水缸里满缸清水，案板上放着许多刀、杓、碗、筷和其他炊具。从这房还可看到后院：五间北屋，中间的门上挂着白布帘；东西两排是十六七间的敞房，都有石槽；西排房的南头堆着干草捆；两匹枣红马在吃草。
    我边看边和他拉话，问他这站是什么时候开设的。据答已有半个多月了，是专门招待过路军人和工作人员的，休息、住宿早晚不误，除米票和草料票可随时兑换外，其他一切水火都是免费供给。
    这种对行军如此方便的招待站，使我回想起了过去陕甘宁边区公家设立的“兵站”。但是这站的招待员却是民选的老百姓。我就问他：“那末，站里的一切开支，从那里来呢？”
    对于这个问题，告诉我最详细的是镇公所的李秘书，原来这招待站的制度，早在几年前就有了。以前是设在离大路很远的二道街上，客人寻找不方便，而且光管找店和兑米，招待工作则由各店家轮流负责。可是店里往往客多人杂，军政同志来晚了就没了房子。店家感到很多困难与麻烦；行军者也都难得到吃睡的舒服。因此写了军民两便计，特将招待站与店房合并，且移设大路旁，民选站长和刘洞等五人负专责，直接受镇公所领导，其经费则由全街店家集股的二十四万元基金营利充作，并负责为军政同志换替拨差（商同镇公所，轮派各住户）。现在初设，每天住宿者已不下四五十人，房子尚不够用，故即准备将东西敞房装修成宿舍。
