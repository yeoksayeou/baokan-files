    Yanggu Public Security Team
    Helping the Masses Deliver Manure
    [This Newspaper's Report] In response to the call to help the masses with production, the comrades of the Yanggu Public Security Team have been actively helping the masses to haul manure. In a day and a half, they completely cleared all the manure on Xu Village Street. The next day, the comrades voluntarily joined the masses in piling up manure. Old Woman Zhang is a widow with four mu of land, all along a deep ditch. Rain had washed away three large gullies, occupying more than one mu of land, making it impossible to fill. With the patient help of the Public Security Team comrades, it was completely filled in less than five days. Old Woman Zhang ran to the field to see, and she said happily: "If it weren't for you, I wouldn't have finished it so soon! The Eighth Route Army truly saves the poor, helping the poor solve their difficulties, I will never forget your kindness." The team is now continuing to help the masses actively engage in production.

    帮助群众送粪
    【本报讯】阳谷公安队响应帮助群众生产的号召，同志们都纷纷帮助群众倒粪，一天半完全把徐庄街上的粪都倒完了。第二天同志们自动与群众在一块堆粪。张老大娘是个寡妇，有地四亩，都靠深沟，下雨时冲了三个大浪窝，足占地一亩多，无法填平，经公安队同志们耐心帮助，不到五天完全填平了，张大娘跑到地里观看，她痛快的说：“要不是您，俺弄完早哩！八路军真是救穷人，帮助穷人解决困难，俺真忘不了你们的好处。”现该队正继续帮助群众积极生产。（阳谷人民小报）
