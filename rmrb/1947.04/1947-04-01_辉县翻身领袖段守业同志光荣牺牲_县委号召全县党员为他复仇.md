[Taiking Dispatch from Our Newspaper on the 30th] The Huixian County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has recently called on all Communist Party members and the masses of the county to take combat actions to avenge Comrade Duan Shouye. Duan was a well-respected leader of the turnaround movement in the county. On the 23rd of last month, he was unfortunately surrounded by the enemy and died heroically. The local government and masses were deeply saddened upon hearing the news. Comrade Shouye was 34 years old, from Xixia Village in the county, and came from a poor family. He worked as a long-term and short-term laborer for landlords throughout his life, enduring the suffering of the poor people in the old society. In the autumn of 1945, after our army's victorious counter-offensive and the establishment of the local democratic government, Comrade Shouye actively participated in the struggle against traitors and bullies and against feudalism. After Chiang Kai-shek's unreasonable attacks, Comrade Shouye continued to persist in local work, mobilizing the masses to struggle, and establishing close ties with the broad masses behind enemy lines in the area. Comrade Duan worked hard, bravely, and actively, and was an excellent Communist Party member. In order to avenge Comrade Duan Shouye, all Communist Party members and the masses in the county are now concentrating all their efforts to crush Chiang Kai-shek's and the puppets' conspiracy to forcibly conscript soldiers in the county.
