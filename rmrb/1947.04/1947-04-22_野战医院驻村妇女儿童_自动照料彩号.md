    [Report from the Northern Henan Front of this newspaper] When a field hospital of the First Army Hospital was stationed in a village in Hui County, the village convened a women's meeting to discuss who the Eighth Route Army was fighting for, in order to mobilize women to take care of the wounded. The women had personally experienced the disasters brought to them by Li Yingshang's "First Route of Suppression of Communists" last December. When they heard that the Eighth Route Army was coming, they were very excited and unanimously believed that the army was fighting for the people. They automatically signed up to take care of the wounded. Fifty-seven young women wanted to be volunteer nurses, and one hundred and twenty adult and elderly women were willing to sew, mend, and wash clothes and quilts for the wounded. When the wounded arrived, the masses scrambled to clear out wards. Ren Cuiying, a young woman in her twenties, wanted to clear out three rooms for the wounded, but her mother refused. She patiently persuaded her mother: "Mom! Don't forget that last year Li Yingshang drove us into the ravines where we had no place to live and nothing to eat! Our troops are going to fight Li Ying this time to avenge us and to prevent us from being ruined by Li Ying again in the future. The army is bleeding and getting wounded for us, what's wrong with us squeezing together for a while!" She finally convinced her mother and cleared out the rooms. The village primary school was not to be outdone, with forty-eight children participating in the care of the wounded. Wang Jingyuan, fourteen years old, took care of the wounded for three consecutive nights, neither afraid nor tired. The female students Wang Baorong and Yang Xuehua were active and meticulous in serving the seriously wounded. Yang, a section chief from the county government, mobilized eighty primary school students and eight middle school students to take care of the wounded. He himself came from eight miles away every other day to visit the wounded in the ward, and mobilized the masses within dozens of miles to send pigs, chickens, and sweet potato noodles to the hospital, ensuring that they would not raise prices when selling to the government. Women from nearby areas came to comfort the wounded with bamboo baskets in their hands, filled with eggs, sour dates, and sesame candy, as if visiting relatives, and asked to be volunteer nurses.
