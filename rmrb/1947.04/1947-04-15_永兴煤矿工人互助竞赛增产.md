　　Yongxing Coal Mine Workers' Mutual Aid Competition Increases Production
    [This newspaper, Changzhi] Thanks to the efforts of the labor union, the leadership of activists, and the promotion of mass mutual aid groups, workers at the Yongxing Coal Mine in Xiaohebao are more friendly and united, resulting in increased production. Labor hero Sun Shiyou and model worker Sun Zhihe not only do their own work well, but also help others; the coal mining record has increased from one foot three inches to three to five feet. At the same time, Sun Shiyou realizes that only by cultivating new talents can we increase our strength. He leads five mutual aid groups, constantly encouraging everyone, and puts forward the slogans "Produce one more point, add one more point to the front line" and "Do a good job in our factory, the factory is rich, and everyone is rich." The workers are all taking active action. (Zhu Youren)
    [This newspaper] The cadre meeting of the No. 1 Military Industry Factory's coal kiln decided to launch a great ignition movement, spark a coal kiln competition, and ensure military production in order to strive to become a Liu Bocheng factory and a model coal kiln. Now the morale is high, and the production performance has increased from a coal digging depth of fifteen inches to twenty-two inches. Comrades such as Gong Laiyun and ten others have performed the best, giving full play to their technical capabilities and promoting the group. Liu, the chief engineer, excitedly said: "I will definitely lead everyone to produce and create a model coal kiln." (Lu Yan)
