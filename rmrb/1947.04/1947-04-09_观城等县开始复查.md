[Report from our correspondent in the Jilu Yu region on the 7th] Guancheng, Zhuxian (Liaocheng), Feicheng, Changqing and other counties are conducting in-depth reviews, and have uncovered a large number of lands and ill-gotten wealth hidden by landlords. In the fourth district of Guancheng, men, women, old and young all participated in the review movement, unearthing six cartloads of copper coins hidden by the landlord Zhang Xinfa in Yanzhuang. In Zhuxian, only in the third and first sub-districts of the fifth district, the Xiama Village in the sixth district, and the North Group in the seventh district, more than sixty hectares of land hidden by landlords were discovered. A large amount of ill-gotten wealth was found in the Chengguan district and Pei Village in the second district. The review method is to mobilize those who hid things for the landlords to report themselves. Longwan Village first convened a meeting to clear the landlords' ill-gotten wealth, held group discussions, and set out reward conditions. The masses also reported those who hid property for the landlords. The fourth district of Feicheng convened a mass meeting in the sub-district to mobilize the masses to cooperate with the cadres in the inspection. An oil mill was found in Jinmen Village, along with three thousand catties of grain. Twenty-nine mu of land and eight thousand catties of grain were found in Xiaotangyu. The sixth district of Changqing established a review committee with the sub-district as the unit. The Kongji sub-district achieved the best results. The method was: the seven villages in the entire sub-district first discussed the review objects separately. In addition to the self-review by each village, the villages also organized mutual reviews.
