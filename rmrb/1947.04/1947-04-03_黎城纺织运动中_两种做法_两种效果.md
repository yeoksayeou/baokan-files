　　Licheng Textile Movement:
    Two Approaches, Two Results
    [Our Dispatch] The basic reason for the uneven development of the Licheng Hundred-Day Textile Movement is the issue of the mass line and democratic work style. Although both started from the subjective desire to improve textile production, the different work styles led to different results. Some areas experienced high morale and consolidated organizations, while others saw declining work and loosening organizations. The former is exemplified by the textile training class led by Li Chunfeng, the chairman of the Women's Rescue Association. She heard from a trainee, Li Qiuju, that "My mother-in-law won't let me wear nice clothes and begrudges me food." Understanding that Qiuju had a poor relationship with her mother-in-law, and also hearing Qiuju's mother-in-law say, "My daughter-in-law doesn't stay at home and doesn't do housework," Chunfeng, in order to improve the relationship between Qiuju and her mother-in-law and consolidate the textile training class, convened a meeting of mothers-in-law. She had them all recount their contributions. After everyone spoke, Chunfeng praised the mothers-in-law for their contributions to helping with textile work and called on others to learn from their spirit. After this, the mothers-in-law's morale improved. Qiuju's mother-in-law personally pushed the millstone to grind flour and sent rice and flour to Qiuju at the textile training class. Comrade Chunfeng seized these facts and had the trainees in the textile training class discuss "How are the mothers-in-law treating us?" Qiuju reviewed her own behavior and said, "My mother-in-law treats me well. It was my fault in the past for looking down on men and on the family. I was wrong to complain." En Huan also reviewed her behavior and said, "In the past, I looked down on men, thinking they were suffering. I will treat them better in the future." In this way, the thoughts of both mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law were clarified, improving the relationship between families and couples, and consolidating the textile training class. The latter example is the Jin Maiqiao textile group in Da Tinghe Village, which lacked a core supported by the women weavers. Due to the cadres' subjective demands, a small factory was established, but the women weavers were not ideologically aligned, and the organization was not sound. The factory supplied the cotton, but even after finding three cotton fluffer bows, there was no time to fluff the cotton. The women weavers' morale was low, and work declined. In over a month, they only wove one machine-load of cloth, leading to financial difficulties. Maiqiao blamed the village cadres for not caring or helping them fluff the cotton; she criticized the women weavers for being ideologically backward and not being active enough. The women weavers said that they couldn't weave because the factory didn't have cotton, and they blamed each other. During meetings, Maiqiao would criticize, and the women weavers would remain silent, leading to many complaints and a standstill in work. The main reasons for this were the failure to grasp the ideological demands of the women weavers, the lack of a core, and an organizational form that did not meet the needs of the masses. The village cadres failed to grasp the importance of ideological leadership in the enthusiastic development of the Hundred-Day Textile Movement, to promote the democratic work style of the mass line, and to use the leadership methods of rewarding more, criticizing less, grasping active elements, and cultivating backbones to promote the work.

　　黎城纺织运动中
    两种做法  两种效果
    【本报讯】黎城百日纺织运动展开的不够平衡的基本原因是群众路线的民主作风问题，虽然都是从搞好纺织的主观愿望出发，但由于作风不同，所以发展结果，有的是情绪高，组织巩固，有的则工作消沉，组织松懈。前者是后＠妇救主席李春逢领导的纺织训练班，她听学员李秋菊说：“婆婆不给穿，看不得吃。”她了解秋菊和婆婆关系不好，又听秋菊婆婆说：“媳妇不住家不做生活。”春逢为了改善秋菊婆媳关系，巩固纺训班，就召集了婆婆会，让婆婆们都访功劳，大家访了以后，春逢又表扬了婆婆帮助纺织的功劳，并提出要学习婆婆们这种精神。此后婆婆们情绪提高了，秋菊的婆婆亲自推碾磨，给秋菊往纺训班送米面，春逢同志抓住这些事实，在纺训班让学员们讨论“婆婆对咱们如何？”秋菊检讨说：“婆婆对咱不错，是我过去看不起男人，看不起家庭，过去是怨咱。”恩唤也检讨说：“我过去就看不起男人，嫌人家是受苦哩，今后可要和人家好些。”这样把婆媳思想都打通了，改善了家庭与夫妇之间的关系，也巩固了纺训班。后者是大停河村靳麦巧纺织组，没有纺妇们拥护的核心，由于干部的主观要求成立了小型工厂，纺妇思想不通，组织也不健全，棉花由厂里供给，曾经找到三个弹花弓，没有时间弹不出花来，纺妇情绪不高，工作消沉，一个多月只织过一机布，弄得周转不开。麦巧怨村干部不关心，不帮助她们弹花；对纺妇批评思想落后，不积极。纺妇说厂里没花不能纺，互相埋怨。开会麦巧就批评，纺妇们不吭气，形成意见很多，工作停顿。其主要原因是没有掌握了纺妇们的思想要求，另外是没有核心，组织形式也不适合群众要求，村干部对热烈开展百日纺织运动没有抓紧贯彻思想领导，发扬群众路线的民主作风，及用多奖励少批评掌握积极分子培养骨干的领导方法推动工作。（杨克虹）
