[This section] Jiyuan Uses Different Methods to Re-examine Different Types of Villages
[Report from our newspaper in Taiyue, 9th] Jiyuan summarized the re-examination movement of the past two months and discovered that many feudal landlords were buying off and utilizing cadres to hide their tails. Also, unfair distribution of fruits and disunity between cadres and the masses gave bad landlords opportunities to exploit. The entire county adopted the following methods based on the different situations of each village: (1) In villages that had generally undergone the movement, cadres had a sense of complacency. Therefore, the approach was to educate cadres by discovering problems and help cadres distinguish between classes and investigate feudalism. Miaojie and other villages used "investigating classes" to squeeze out several feudal tails. (2) In backward villages such as Beiguanzhuang, special agents corrupted the chairman of the farmers' association, causing him to embezzle fruits, and also incited middle peasants who were being struggled against to beat cadres to death. After the leadership discovered this, they guided the masses to expose the special agents' conspiracy and conduct ideological education, and then moved towards investigating feudalism. In Nanzhuang and other villages, feudal forces still held the upper hand, and the masses dared not speak. They mobilized activists from advanced neighboring villages to encourage the masses to overthrow feudalism. (3) In villages where the masses were thoroughly mobilized, such as "Du Balian," the masses had a higher level of awareness. As soon as the re-examination was proposed, it naturally targeted feudal forces, not only recovering the land and houses of landlords, but also eliminating the remaining political influence and superstitions of feudal forces, and bad habits such as patriarchal oppression of women. (4) In border areas such as Hancun, where the masses had been allocated land but then had it recalculated, their morale was low. The re-examination was combined with opposing "recalculation," summarizing the experience of neighboring villages in opposing "recalculation," and conducting education. The leadership also supported the masses and recovered the land and property that had been "recalculated." In the two months of re-examination, three points of experience were gained: (1) Cadres' work style must be meticulous and patient in order to quickly discover problems. (2) The re-examination of backward villages must adopt the method of focusing on one point to overcome backward thinking with the advanced thinking of the masses. (3) Mobilizing women to participate in the movement can deepen the re-examination and consolidate the foundation. In Chengcun, after mobilizing women and distributing fruits during the re-examination, the women also brought up several feudal tails.

　　济源不同类型村
    用不同方法复查
    【本报太岳九日电】济源总结两月复查运动，发现不少封建地主，收买利用干部，隐藏尾巴；亦有因果实分配不公，干、群不团结，给了坏地主以钻空子机会。全县依据各村不同情况，采取以下几种作法：（一）一般经过运动的村庄，干部有自满思想，因此在作法上便是从发现问题中教育干部，帮助干部划清阶级、查封建。庙街等村即以“查阶级”，挤出几条封建尾巴来。（二）落后村如北官庄，特务腐蚀农会主席，使其贪污果实，又鼓动被斗争之中农，打死干部。经领导上发现，便引导群众揭露特务阴谋，进行思想教育，而后走向查封建。南庄等村封建势力仍占优势，群众不敢说话，便发动先进邻村之积极分子来鼓动群众斗倒封建。（三）群众彻底发动了的村庄，如“杜八联”，群众觉悟程度较高；复查一提出，很自然的对准封建势力，不仅收回了地主的土地、房屋，并扫除了封建势力在政治上的残余影响与迷信，家长压迫妇女等恶习。（四）边沿区韩村等地群众分得土地，又被倒算，情绪低落，则以复查结合反“倒算”，总结邻村反“倒算”经验，进行教育。领导上并为群众撑腰，夺回被“倒算”的土地财物。在两个月的复查中，并获得三点经验：（一）干部的作风必须细致耐心，才会迅速发现问题。（二）落后村庄的复查，必须采取突击一点，以群众的先进思想去克服落后思想。（三）发动妇女，参加运动，才能使复查深入，基础巩固。程村在复查中经过发动妇女，并给分果实后，妇女又提出几条封建尾巴来。
