    Taiyue District Draws Over a Hundred Cadres
    To Carry Out Land Reform in Recovered Areas
    [This newspaper, Taiyue, 23rd dispatch] In order to mobilize the masses in the newly recovered areas on both sides of the Fen River and implement land reform, the Taiyue District Party Committee has specially selected 140 strong cadres to form peasant turn-over teams. Eighty people, led by Comrades Ren Mingdao and Zhang Dewei, set off a few days ago. Before their departure, they held meetings for several days to study the land reform work in the newly recovered areas. On the 18th, Comrade Guo Qin'an of the District Party Committee attended and reported on the current situation and the tasks of the turn-over teams. He pointed out: This is a great mission to liberate the people of southern Shanxi from thousands of years of feudal rule and to destroy the bloody rule of the puppet-reactionaries. Comrade Qin'an called on everyone to work hard and make contributions to the local people. Finally, Comrade Qin'an also hoped that everyone would pioneer the party newspaper work in the newly recovered areas, write articles for the newspaper, and write to the party newspaper the demands of the people in the newly recovered areas and work experience at any time.
