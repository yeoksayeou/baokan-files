　　【Report from this newspaper in Xiyang】The Dongfeng Ren Cooperative, with the help of the Jinnan Bank County Branch, has established a credit business and achieved success in organizing mass production. The credit department was established in April last year. It started with a loan of 30,000 yuan from the bank, and then absorbed 200,000 yuan in deposits. Initially, loans were given to six households, totaling 45,000 yuan, which, combined with the borrowers' own funds, allowed them to buy six donkeys. In July, after the masses withdrew their deposits, leaving 70,000 yuan, the cooperative obtained another loan of 50,000 yuan from the bank. The cooperative then spent 340,000 yuan in total to buy eighteen donkeys, which were loaned to the masses at the original purchase price. In the autumn, the village needed to pay a total of 800,000 yuan in grain quotas and funds. The cooperative then organized large-scale transportation, selling charcoal in Xingtai. After four trips, they paid off the grain quotas. At this time, the cooperative proposed to solve the village's livestock problem, aiming for "households without donkeys to buy donkeys, and households with donkeys to exchange for better donkeys." They then obtained another loan of 70,000 yuan from the bank and loaned it to three poor households, including Zhang Suoxiao, who combined it with their own funds of 7,000 yuan to buy three donkeys. From last winter to now, through transportation and livestock exchanges, the entire village of 149 households has 117 donkeys (the cooperative also has six mules). After the official establishment of the credit department, it has helped the masses buy a total of 27 donkeys. It is estimated that winter transportation and production can earn 648,000 yuan (excluding other livestock). Currently, each donkey is worth an average of 50,000 yuan. Zhang Chengsuo originally borrowed 12,000 yuan, and borrowed another 8,000 yuan from the mutual aid group to buy a donkey. Last winter, he transported charcoal to Xingtai eight times, earning a total of 30,000 yuan, which he then used to trade for a better donkey, worth 55,000 yuan. This method of providing loans and absorbing deposits based on the production and living needs of the masses, on the one hand, increased capital for production, and on the other hand, organized the masses to repay grain quotas through production after the loans were issued. As a result, all loan recipients benefited. Recently, the cooperative has further determined, based on the demands of the masses, that they will allow shares to be bought and sold at any time, turning shares into deposits and deposits into shares, to facilitate the absorption of deposits. The interest calculated on deposits for temporary shares is called "temporary dividends," and the dividends distributed based on the length of time, amount of money, and number of shares when temporary shares are deposited until the dividend settlement date are called "fixed-term dividends." Continue to promote the deposit of physical objects such as grain and the repayment of grain with grain, so that surplus grain can be transferred into production, and households with surplus grain can also obtain profits. Loan recipients can borrow grain to purchase other physical objects or tools for production, and repay the grain loan after increasing profits through production, so they will never suffer losses even if prices rise or fall.

　　东丰稔合作社建立信用业务
    利用贷款吸取游资     
    帮助群众买驴运输
    【本报昔阳讯】东丰稔合作社，在冀南银行县支行的帮助下，建立信用业务，在组织群众生产上获得成绩。信用部是在去年四月份成立，先由银行贷款三万元，后吸收到存款二十万元，开始时贷给六户，计洋四万五千元，结合了贷户自己资金，买到毛驴六头。七月份群众存款抽的剩下七万元，又在银行贷款五万元，合作社拿出款三十四万元，一并买到毛驴十八头；按原买价全数贷给群众，到秋后全村负担粮款计需洋八十万元，合作社便组织大运输，往邢台卖炭，运了四次，便将负担粮款交了。这时合作社便提出解决全村牲口问题要“没驴户买到驴，有驴户换好驴”。便又在银行贷款七万元，贷给张锁小等三个贫苦户，结合了他们本身资金七千元，买到毛驴三头。经过去冬到现在运输与倒换牲口，全村一百四十九户，就有毛驴一百一十七头（合作社另有骡六头）。在信用部正式成立后，共帮助群众买到的毛驴二十七头，冬季运输生产计可赚洋六十四万八千元（其他牲口除外），现每头驴平均价值五万元。张成锁原贷款一万二千元，由互助组内借洋八千元，买到毛驴一头，去冬往邢台运炭八次，共赚洋三万元，便贴换成一头好毛驴，可值价五万五千元。这种从群众生产与生活需要上，进行放款与吸收存款的方法，一方面给生产上增加了资本，同时贷出后又组织群众从生产上归还粮款，因而所有贷款户都能得到利益。最近该社更依据群众要求确定了今后要随时入股，随时抽股，用股金变存款，存款变股金的办法，以便利吸收存款。随时抽股按存款计算的利息，叫做“临时红”，如临时入股存款到期结红时，按日期长短与款数、股数分红润叫“期结红”。继续提倡以粮食等实物存款，贷粮还粮，这样余粮便可转入生产，余粮户也能得到利润。贷户借到粮食，购置其他实物或工具，用于生产事业上，经过生产增利后归还贷粮，就是物价涨跌，也绝不会吃亏。  （恩惠）
