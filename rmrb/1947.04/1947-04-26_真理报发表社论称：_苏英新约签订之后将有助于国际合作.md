Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 22nd: TASS reports: *Pravda* recently published an editorial entitled "On the Question of the New Anglo-Soviet Treaty," which stated: Foreign newspapers are filled with all sorts of speculations and unfounded conjectures regarding the progress of negotiations to revise the 1942 Anglo-Soviet Treaty. In particular, a *New York Times* reporter in Moscow sent a dispatch reporting that he had learned from "reliable diplomatic sources" that the Soviet Union had proposed and insisted on adding a clause to the treaty to effectively separate Britain diplomatically from the United States. Two days later, a Reuters diplomatic correspondent also repeated the *New York Times'* report. In fact, the Soviet Union has never opposed and will never oppose Anglo-American amity or Anglo-French amity, and therefore the current draft of the new Anglo-Soviet treaty does not and will not include such a clause; on the contrary, the Soviet Union, in addition to actively advocating strengthening Anglo-Soviet cooperation, also actively advocates strengthening Anglo-American and Anglo-French cooperation. Of course, this cooperation must not be anti-Soviet. The strengthening of Anglo-Soviet friendship does not affect or prevent the strengthening of friendship between Britain and other countries, especially between Britain and the United States. At the same time, the Soviet people have always believed that treaties or agreements establishing genuine friendship should be established between major powers and prevent some contracting states from participating in groups and actions against other contracting states. Therefore, the new Anglo-Soviet treaty should not only help enhance Anglo-Soviet friendship, but also contribute to the common cause of international cooperation.

　　真理报发表社论称：
    苏英新约签订之后将有助于国际合作
    【新华社陕北二十二日电】塔斯社讯：真理报顷以“论英苏新约问题”为题，发表社论，略称：外国报纸对修改一九四二年英苏条约商谈之进行一事，充满着各种各样的推测与毫无根据之臆断。特别是纽约时报记者由莫斯科发出探悉“可靠外交方面”之电讯报导说：苏联提出建议，坚决主张在条约中加进一项条款，借以使英国在外交上确实自美国分离。两日之后，路透社外交记者也重复纽约时报之报导。事实上，苏联过去从未有过也不会有任何反对英美亲善或英法亲善的事情，因此现在英苏新约草案没有包括也不会包括这样的条款；恰恰相反，苏联除积极主张加强英苏合作之外，还积极主张加强英美、英法合作。当然，这种合作必须不是反苏的。英苏友谊的增强，毫不影响更不阻止英国和其他国家之间尤其是英美间友谊的增强。同时，苏联人民一向认为：各大国间应当建立真正友谊的条约或协定，并阻止某一部分缔约国参加反对其他部分缔约国之集团与行动。所以，英苏新约不仅应该有助于英苏友谊的增强；同时，对于国际合作的共同事业，也是有所贡献的。
