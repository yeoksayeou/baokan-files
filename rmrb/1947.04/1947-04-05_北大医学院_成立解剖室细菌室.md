　　Peking University Medical School
    Establishes Anatomy and Bacteriology Laboratories
    [Reported by this newspaper] The affiliated hospital of Peking University Medical School and the anatomy, bacteriology, and physiochemical internship laboratories, after three months of preparation, finally opened on the 23rd of last month. The visiting guests looked with excitement at the instruments and sterilization equipment in the operating room. In particular, the more than 300 pieces of equipment in the anatomy internship laboratory, all created by the people of the liberated areas, surprised the visitors. In the bacteriology internship laboratory, new-style microscopes ranging from 700 to 2,000 times magnification were arranged one after another on the testing platform, which was more than two zhang long. Various types of bacterial culture media were displayed on the surrounding platforms, with various types and strains of bacteria being nourished and developed inside, showing different bacterial films and colonies. On the other side were self-prepared staining reagents, which is enough to show that the liberated areas can now begin bacteriological research, which is a great victory. In the physiochemical laboratory, refined pharmaceuticals and reagents were neatly placed in bottles arranged in a stepped manner; on the other side were physical and chemical instruments. Many of the instruments were unfamiliar even to university professors from Beiping, all of which were created by the people's scientists themselves using "indigenous methods," achieving equally "scientific conclusions." The trainees newly arrived from the KMT-controlled areas of Beiping and Tianjin said excitedly, "I really didn't expect that in the liberated areas, under such difficult material conditions, especially in the short three-month preparation period, there would be such amazing achievements, which makes me feel unexpectedly happy and further strengthens my belief in the people's cause."

　　北大医学院
    成立解剖室细菌室
    【本报讯】筹备三月的北大医学院附属医院及解剖、细菌、理化各实习室，终于在上月二十三日开幕了。参观的来宾们，都用兴奋的眼光注视着手术室中的器械及消毒设备，尤其是解剖实习室内三百余件完全由解放区人民创造出的器械，使参观者十分惊讶。细菌实习室内两丈多长的试验台上，从七百到二千倍的新式显微镜，一架连着一架的排列着，周围的台上陈列着各种各样的细菌培养基，各类及不同株的细菌在里面滋养发育着，出现了不同的菌苔和集落。在另一面则放着自己配制的染色药品，这足以表示解放区今天已能开始细菌的研究，这是一大胜利。理化室中，药品试药精致的放在排成阶梯状的瓶中；另一面则是物理及化学的仪器。有许多仪器能使从北平来的大学教授们看着“眼生”，那都是人民科学家自己用“土办法”创造出来，同样得“科学结论”的成绩。新从平津蒋管区来的学员们，一个个兴奋的说：“我真想不到解放区这样困难的物质条件下，尤其是短短三个月的筹备期，会有这样惊人的成绩，实使我心内感到意外的愉快，这更确定了我对人民事业的信仰。”（克明）
