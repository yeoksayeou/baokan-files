    From Panic to Fearlessness
    The Experience of a Certain District in Yuncheng Advancing Behind Enemy Lines to Distribute Land
    Li Fu
    A certain district in Yuncheng is located in the gap between two highways. From February 25th to March 14th, over a period of twenty days, this district found a way to "hold a gun in one hand and distribute land in the other," and launched a district-wide land reform movement. No matter how the enemy "suppressed" it, they could not stop the development of this movement. The process of launching this movement and the ideological changes of the cadres in adhering to guerrilla warfare are written below, focusing on one sub-district, for reference:

    (1) Going to the enemy's rear area indeed went through a great deal of ideological struggle
    Around February 20th, news of the Chiang army's northward offensive spread, and the situation became even tenser after the enemy occupied Juancheng. At this time, I myself went through a great deal of ideological struggle. Should I persist? Or should I leave? Sometimes I thought about the issue of sacrificing for the people, but then I thought, would I necessarily be sacrificed? "How can one catch tiger cubs without entering the tiger's lair?" After thinking it over and over, I made the determination to persevere. On the morning of the 4th, the enemy's vehicles arrived while the entire district was holding an activist meeting. The cadres temporarily left the district, and after stopping, they streamlined the old and weak and organized four armed work teams, each with thirteen or fourteen people (including cadres, militia, and overseas Chinese students), and then inserted them back.

    (2) The enemy is tight in the front and loose in the rear, and the closer you get to the enemy, the bolder you become
    When returning to the district to carry out activities, everyone's main concerns were: 1. The situation is not understood, what if we run into the enemy's nest and can't get out? 2. What if bad elements in the village report us? Everyone discussed methods, looked for guides, and inquired about the situation everywhere. They also thought: people are alive, we are familiar with all the villages, and we can hide anywhere. So the main cadres led the way in front and inserted themselves back. When crossing the highway, everyone became tense again when they were told to "go faster." Later, when they arrived at × village, everyone calmed down again when they heard children playing in the village and someone telling stories. In this way, sometimes tight and sometimes loose, they never encountered anything. After settling down for the night, they learned that there was only one enemy stronghold in ×× village and that our Yuncheng-Juancheng County government was also stationed nearby, having just held a conference and executed several bad landlords. At this time, everyone's morale stabilized. The next day, enemy vehicles and infantry passed by near the stationed village from morning to noon, but everyone was very calm and often went to take a look. That night, they returned to their own team, and the masses came to greet them and report the situation. A poor anti-Japanese soldier's family member said loudly: "It doesn't matter, the reactionary landlords here are afraid of being beaten, and they also say that the Central Army won't occupy for long. We'll graze sheep in Xiwali to keep watch for you, and you can rest in the village!" This gave everyone more confidence. It turned out that the closer you got to the enemy, the bolder you became, and they began to carry out activities in groups.

    (3) First drive the local bad eggs into the stronghold
    After my group settled down, they learned that the puppet district department had been established. Several bad eggs, carrying a few guns, were eating and drinking and extorting the masses. There were also two or three stray Chiang soldiers, carrying sticks, catching chickens everywhere and raping women. In these four or five days, social order began to be disrupted. At this time, the biggest threat to us was these local bad eggs, and we decided to arrest them. After understanding the situation, one night we organized more than ten people, led by the responsible comrade, and went to arrest them. We searched several villages in a row, but didn't catch anyone, but the puppet district chief and those guys were frightened. The puppet district chief ran all the way to the city gate, shouting: "The Eighth Route Army hasn't left completely, I dare not do it!" At this time, we also heard that the South Group had arrested two secret agents and executed them. Everyone was very happy. After this, the local bad eggs were considered to have been driven into the stronghold.

    (4) Catching Chiang soldiers and the enemy's retaliation
    In the beginning, we mostly carried out activities at night, and we didn't dare to carry out activities in the daytime, for fear of running into the enemy. We considered that if we didn't carry out activities openly, this area would not become ours, and if we didn't get close to the broad masses, it would be difficult to mobilize the broad masses to fight the enemy. We decided to work openly in the villages, send out sentries, and hide when a large number of enemies came, and catch them when there were only a few. One day, when two Chiang soldiers passed by the village, we wanted to catch them, but the villagers blocked the door and wouldn't let us out, for fear of causing trouble. Afterwards, everyone discussed this matter. I thought: should we "not excessively" stimulate the enemy and mainly do village work? Or should we catch them? I let everyone discuss it. The messenger Xiao Guang said bluntly: "I don't agree at all!" Several other people also said: if we only consider the village, we shouldn't have come in, so we decided to be firm. Later, we caught three Chiang soldiers and killed one. Everyone thought: the enemy must come when they hear the gunfire, so we moved. A sick sub-district cadre came and said: as soon as he heard that Chiang soldiers had been caught, his illness was half cured. We went to × village to meet with the South Group, and the South Group also proposed a competition to catch Chiang soldiers. But the enemy did come to retaliate, with a battalion and two vehicles firing machine guns and artillery at × village, and suppressing ×× two villages. When we returned to × village that night to express our condolences, there was no one there. The next day, the enemy came out again to suppress a village, and captured the village chief and the farmers' association chairman.

    (5) At first, we thought it was causing trouble, but the research result was our great victory
    The incident of capturing three Chiang soldiers caused "trouble"! I also had this idea. Several village cadres shrunk their heads because of "causing trouble." Some said: in the future, battles should be fought in the open fields. After another thought: it is not easy to fight in the open fields, then in the future, the enemy can fight us in the villages, and we cannot fight the enemy? Finally, the conclusion was: most people are happy. As for the individual villages that suffer losses, we can provide relief in the future, and we cannot lose the big picture for the sake of small things. In the future, we will give them blows everywhere, and they will not be able to suppress them all. Everyone continued to realize the achievements of the past five or six days of struggle: we drove away the puppet district department and the secret service team, and the enemy did not dare to carry out activities in groups of two or three. This increased the gaps in our activities and reduced the losses of the masses. A few days later, when we went to understand the situation in the surrounding villages, the common people said: since that time, the enemy has never dared to come to the villages to cause trouble with only a few people. "In the past, the enemy dared to come to the market alone, but now it is at least a squad, with bayonets, taking things and leaving." At this time, the idea of "causing trouble" was overcome. The problem of wanting to go home and not work was also not serious. However, some local cadres still felt that "there is no food or fuel at home," "they cannot take care of their families outside," and "there is no danger in staying at home," etc. The result of the research was that the reason why they could live at home was the result of our guerrilla team. If there is no firewood and grain at home, we must first solve it. If the guerrilla team is disbanded, the world is in chaos, business cannot be done, no one will carry out land reform, and bad elements will be active everywhere, maybe they will turn around. If we want to protect our family's life, we must hold a gun in one hand to fight guerrillas and distribute land in the other. In this way, fighting guerrillas and taking care of the family changed from contradiction to unity. So they didn't mention going home.

    (6) Starting to get through the idea of land reform
    Then we started to carry out village-level work, doing things like holding village cadre meetings, landlord meetings, and making three-chapter agreements with reactionary landlords, and carrying out anti-enemy-aid work. Both of these things were done with achievements. But the main task was land reform, first distributing firewood, and those who did not implement it would be punished according to law. When deploying land reform, some said: the masses dare not want it. We dispersed and understood a little, and the masses generally felt that they had no firewood to burn. An old woman in × village proposed: "When distributing land, don't forget me." The Baojia chief said that poor people were unwilling to move houses, because they thought the houses were too big and were afraid of being cold, but a poor farmer in × village who lived in a temple said: "What am I afraid of, I'll come out again if I'm not allowed to live." A farmers' association member in × village said: it is better to be killed than to starve to death. When discussing felling trees in × village, a Jia chief proposed that there were gods on the big trees, and a poor farmer said: "What gods are there?" This understanding opened our minds a lot, and we felt that we had been too detached from the masses in the past. So we went to the villages to hold meetings and set a deadline for completing land reform. After working for a few days, there was not much progress, and only a few villages felled the trees of the bullies. At this time, a new threat came again, and the enemy's secret service team and more than twenty plainclothes men became active again.

    (7) Resolutely suppress local bad eggs
    We discovered that there were hidden activities of the puppet district department in × village, and a puppet township chief appeared, engaging in enemy-aiding activities. The enemy's "suppression" became more and more serious, but the landlords did not dare to pour out grain and land, and the masses did not bow their heads. In × village, the enemy looked for the gun squad and stabbed the legs of two children with bayonets, but they always said they didn't know. When they asked the old mother, she also said the same. We asked the village chief: "Can you persevere?" He said: "It doesn't matter, there are no bad people at the moment, the Central Government is not afraid of him." In the third suppression, dozens of women and children were beaten, a child was burned to death, and a farmers' association member was caught. Under the enemy's beatings and beatings, he never revealed any secrets. As soon as the Chiang army left, he immediately found my armed work team. When he returned to the village at night, he was still energetic. He said: "The knife is inserted into the chest, just like a thorn in the flesh. I will fight the old life with Old Chiang to the end." But bad people also began to counterattack. The landlord in × village poured out grain, and secret agents were active. We decided to resolutely suppress them in order to change the situation. So we agreed with the South Group to first suppress × market, scaring away the big secret agent and catching the landlord who poured out grain. When we arrived at × village, we burned the deer village, leveled the bunker, whirred and buzzed. After finishing, we fired a row of guns and finally executed two reactionary elements. After this major action, the next day, the enemy suppressed a certain sub-district again with two vehicles and seventy or eighty people, but we also turned to the east and suppressed the secret agents in × market.

    (8) Second cleaning up the "causing trouble" ideology
    After this period, everyone's emotions were a little tired, and they wanted to rest and eat something good. We decided to clean up the ideological problems again. We held a plenary meeting on March 11 and solved two problems from the discussion: one was that we were originally happy to kill bad eggs, but it increased panic and felt that: "Wouldn't this provoke the retaliation of the ruling class?" In fact, this was influenced by the landlord class. Hitting the Central Government was the first "causing trouble," and killing bad eggs was the second "causing trouble." I also thought that some activists would be scared out, but in fact they didn't. On the contrary, they said: "This will be peaceful for a few days!" I was shocked and asked him why. They all said: "Once this is fought, the bad elements will not dare to move." At this time, I realized that the more severely the bad elements are suppressed, the less dare they move, and the happier the masses are. The second point was to review our mass work. The Baojia chief said that we could not hold mass meetings, so we did not hold them. As a result, we fell into the trap of the rulers. Without the power of the masses, only administrative power, the work we deployed could not be done seriously. The farmers' association could not be established because they were afraid of the landlords and Baojia chiefs. They should be held responsible, and those who distributed things did not dare to ask for them, and they should also be held responsible.

    (9) The land reform movement is launched
    After the meeting, just as we were about to set off, we suddenly heard that the enemy had killed two people and shot the child of the old cadre Fang ×× of × sub-district. When Fang ×× heard that his son was dead, he said: "Leave me, and I will swear to lead the masses to turn over to the end!" Everyone quickly entered the villages to work. When they arrived at × village, they held a village meeting that was crowded with people. Fang × said: "My son died for his father, which is the greatest filial piety. We must continue the land reform. Who is the bad water in our village, watch your head." He also talked about making covenants, measuring land, and felling trees. After the meeting, they started to carry out activities at night. Another village also felled trees the next day. The landlord took out the old covenant and made a new covenant. Several teams of people were measuring the land and inserting new wooden signs. The masses in × village went to fell trees in groups, and we thought we had discovered the enemy. In the past, only a few trees were felled in × village, but this afternoon, seventeen or eighteen trees were felled. In another village, a group of old mothers said: "The Eighth Route Army really thinks of us poor people!" A poor farmer who was allocated nine acres of land waved to me and said to me: "I have no firewood to burn once the new year is over, and I don't even dare to drink enough water." The masses all said: "This method is the only way." These days, the sentry's vigilance has also improved compared to before. Each village sends several sentries to three miles away, and they are responsible for various directions themselves. The more land reform, the higher the enthusiasm of the masses, the stricter the precautions, and the more enthusiastic the movement. Due to the active offensive against the enemy and local bad eggs, the land reform movement has greatly developed (the Central Group even measured the land in the dark), the morale of the masses is very high. In other districts, the Ji banknotes were one yuan for one yuan or two yuan, but in this district, it was one yuan for five or six yuan, and each village constantly sent intelligence to the guerrillas every day.

    (10) Without thorough land reform, there is no mass guerrilla war
    We deeply realized that without thorough land reform, there is no mass guerrilla war. To achieve this step, we must attack the enemy and local bad eggs in an offensive spirit, strive for open and legal activities as much as possible, eliminate the "causing trouble" compromising and retreating ideology, and suppress reactionary elements until the enthusiastic mass land reform is carried out, and control the rural situation so that it always belongs to the peasants.

    Guerrilla warfare has two disciplines: one is for the enemy, and there are military methods; one is for local bad eggs, and there are methods for distributing land. Basically, we concentrate to deal with the enemy's situation and disperse to carry out land reform. How to concentrate and how to disperse depends on the enemy's situation and the strength of the enemy and ourselves. The leadership must also be bold in creating, the road is going through, so we should start the machine more, pay attention to ideological leadership; actively attack the enemy more, and get closer to the masses, so as to get inspiration from the masses. Leading the armed work team in this way gradually leads from panic to fearlessness.

    由恐慌走向无畏
    郓城某区挺进敌后分田经验
    李夫
    郓城某区处在两条公路的夹缝中，从二月二十五到三月十四日，前后二十天内，该区摸到了“一手拿枪一手分田”的道路，掀起了全区性的土地改革运动；无论敌人怎样“清剿”，也不能阻止这一运动的发展。兹将这一运动开展的经过与干部坚持游击战争中的思想变化，以一个小区为主写在下面，以供参考：
    （一）搞到敌人后方去，确实经过了一番很大的思想斗争
    二月二十日左右，蒋军北犯的消息就传播开了，敌人一占巨野，风声更紧。这时我本身作了很大的思想斗争，坚持呢？还是离开呢？有时想到为人民牺牲的问题，但又想，难道一定会牺牲吗？“不入虎穴，焉得虎子”，想来想去，才下了坚持的决心。四号上午全区正开活动分子会，敌人的汽车来到了，干部暂时离开了本区，停住脚后，即精减了老弱，组织了四个武工队，各十三、四人（有干部、民兵，有华侨学生），再插回去。
    （二）敌人前紧后松，越接近敌人越大胆
    回区去活动，大家的顾虑主要是：一、情况不了解，假使跑到敌人窝里，跑不出来呢？二、住到村里坏分子告发呢？大家研究着办法、找带路的，到处打听情况，又想到：人是活的，我们各村都熟，那里都能隐蔽一下，于是主要干部在头里领着，就往回插。过汽车路时，一传“走快”，情绪又紧张了一段。后来到了×村，一听村里孩子吵闹，还有说书的，大家心里又平静了。这样一紧一松，却始终没有碰上什么。晚上住下，一打听，只有××村有一个敌据点：附近还住着我郓巨县政府，刚开了大会，枪毙了几个坏地主。这时大家情绪稳定了。第二天在驻村附近敌人的汽车步兵从早晨过到晌午，大家都很沉着，常去看看。当天晚上就回到本队，群众纷纷来问好，报告情况。一个贫苦抗属大声的说：“不要紧，这里反动地主被打怕了，他们也说中央军占不长。我们在西洼里放羊给你放哨，你在村里歇着吧！”这使大家更增加了信心，原来越接近敌人越大胆，即分组活动起来。
    （三）先把本地坏蛋赶到据点里去
    我某组住下后，知道伪区部已成立了，几个坏蛋带几支枪大吃大喝，敲诈群众，还有三三两两的蒋军散兵，拿着棍子，到处捉鸡，奸淫妇女，这四五天内，社会秩序开始紊乱了。这时首先给我们威胁的是这些本地坏蛋，我们决心逮捕他们。了解情况后，某夜组织了十多个人，由负责同志领头，即前去逮捕。一连搜查了几个村子，没有逮住一个，但把伪区长那些家伙吓坏了。伪区长一直跑到城关，吵着：“八路军没有走净，我是不敢干了！”这时也听到南组逮住了两个特务，枪毙了，大家很高兴，经这一搞，本地坏蛋算是被撵到据点里去了。
    （四）捉蒋军与敌人的报复
    开始多是晚上活动，还不敢白天活动，怕与敌人碰上。我们考虑到：不公开活动，这地区就变不成我们的，不接近广大群众，就难以发动广大群众对敌斗争。就决定公开在村里工作，放出哨去，大股敌人来了就躲避，几个人就捉他。某日有两个蒋军从村边过，我们要捉，村里群众堵住门，不让出去，怕惹了祸。事后大家研究这个事，我想：还是“不过分”刺激敌人，主要做村里工作呢？或者捉呢？就让大家讨论，通讯员小广劈头一句说：“我根本不赞成”！另外几个人也说：光顾及村里，我们就不该进来，于是决定坚决干。后来就捉了三个蒋军，打死了一个。大家心想：敌人听到枪声一定要来，我们就转移了。一个病了的小区干部赶来，他说：一听说捉了蒋军，病就好了一半。到×村会合了南组，南组也提出捉蒋军竞赛。但敌人确来报复了，以一个营两辆汽车回×村打了一阵机枪，又打了炮，剿了××两个村子，我们当夜回×村慰问时，一个人也没有了，敌人第二天又出来剿了一个村，捉去了村长与农会长。
    （五）起初以为是惹了祸，研究结果却是我们的大胜利
    捕捉三个蒋军的事件，惹起“祸”来了！我也有这个想法，有几个村干，因“惹祸”缩了头。有的说：今后打仗要在野地里打；再一想：野地里不好打，那以后敌人能在村里打我们，我们就不能打敌人？最后得出结论：大多数高兴就行。至于个别村受损失，以后我们可以救济，不能因小失大。以后到处给他们打击，他们就剿不胜剿了。大家又继续认识到这五六天来的斗争成绩：我们赶走了伪区部、特务队，敌人不敢三三两两地活动了，这增加了我们活动的空隙，减少了群众损失。几天以后，我们到附近一带村一了解，老百姓都说：自那次以后，敌人再不敢几个人到村里胡闹了，“以前敌人一个人也敢来赶集，现在至少是一个班，上着刺刀，弄了东西就走。”这时就克服了“惹祸”的思想。要回家不干的问题也不严重了。但还有本地干部感到“家里没吃没烧”，“在外不能顾家”，“在家住也没危险”等想法，研究的结果，家里所以能住，是有我们游击队的结果，家里没柴粮，要首先进行解决。如果游击队解散了，世道乱了，生意做不成，没人进行土地改革，到处有坏分子活动，说不定还要掉头。要想保障家里生活，必须一手拿枪打游击，一手分田，这样打游击与顾家由矛盾变为一致了。于是不提回家的事了。
    （六）开始打通搞土地改革的思想
    接着即开始进行村级工作，做到开村干会、地主会，与反动地主约法三章，另外进行反资敌，这两点做的都有成绩。但主要的工作是土地改革，先分柴，谁不执行就依法制裁。布置土地改革时，有的说：群众不敢要，我们分散了解了一下，群众普遍感到没柴烧，×村一个老妈妈提出：“分地可不要忘了我。”保甲长说穷人不愿搬房子，嫌屋子大，怕冷，但×村住庙的一个贫农说：“俺怕啥，不叫住俺再出来。”×村的一个农会员说：杀死也比饿死渴死强。×村讨论伐树时，一个甲长提出大树上有神，一个贫农说：“啥神不神。”这一了解，给我们脑子开朗了不少，觉得过去我们太脱离群众了。于是我们到各村开会，限期完成土地改革。作了几天，起色不大，只有少数村子伐了恶霸的树。这时新的威胁又来了，敌人的特务队与二十多个便衣又活动起来。
    （七）坚决镇压本地坏蛋
    我们发现了×村有伪区部的隐蔽活动，出现了伪乡长，运动资敌，敌人的“清剿”也一次比一次严重，但地主还不敢倒粮倒地，群众也没有低头，在×村，敌人找枪班，用刺刀连戳了两个儿童的腿，始终说不知道，又问老妈妈，她也是一样不说。我们问村长：“能坚持吗”？他说：“不要紧，当紧没有坏人，中央不怕他”。第三次清剿，妇女小孩被打的有几十人，烧死一个小孩子，一个农会委员被捉住后，在敌人捆打下，始终不暴露秘密，蒋军一走，他立即找到我武工队，晚上他回到村里，还是一个劲，他讲：“刀插在胸膛，只当是肉上扎根刺，我要把老命与老蒋拚到底。”但坏人也开始反攻了，×村地主倒了粮，暗探在活动。我们就决定坚决镇压，以转换形势，于是约同南组，首先清剿了×集，吓跑了大特务，捉了倒粮的大地主。到×村，烧了鹿砦，平了碉堡，呼呼隆隆，办完后还打了一排子枪，最后把两个反动分子处决了。这次大行动以后，第二天，敌人两辆汽车，七八十个人就又清剿某小区了，但我们也转到东边，清剿了×集的特务。
    （八）第二次清理“惹祸”思想
    经过这一段，大家的情绪有些疲惫，想休息，想吃点好的，我们就决定再清理一下思想问题，三月十一日开全体会，从座谈中解决了两个问题：一个是杀了坏蛋本来高兴，却增加了恐慌，感到：“这不激起统治阶级的报复吗？”实际上这是受了地主阶级的影响，打中央是第一“惹祸”，杀坏蛋又是第二“惹祸”。我自己也想，又得有些积极分子吓的跑出来了，但事实上没有，他们反说：“这又得平安几天了！”我吃了一惊，问他为什么，他们都说：“这一打，坏分子就不敢动了。”这时我才知道：对坏分子镇压越厉害，他越不敢动，群众越高兴。第二点是检讨了我们的群众工作，保甲长说开不起群众会，我们就不开了，结果我们上了统治者的圈套，没群众力量，只行政力量，布置的工作就不能认真做。农会开不起来，是怕地主和保甲长，应叫他们负责，分东西的不敢要，也叫他们负责。
    （九）土地改革运动搞起来了
    会后，正要出发，忽听到敌人杀了两个人，把×小区老干部房××的孩子枪毙了，房××听到儿子死了，他说：“留下我，誓死领导群众翻身到底！”大家迅速进入各村工作，到了×村开村民大会，拥满了一街，房×讲：“儿子替老子死，这是尽大孝，我们要继续土地改革，咱这村里谁是坏水，留心您的脑袋。”又讲了立约、量地、伐树。会后晚上就活动起来。另一村在第二天也伐起树来，地主拿出了老约，又立新约，好几班子人在量地，插上新木牌。×村群众成群结队去伐树，我们以为发现敌人了。×村过去只伐了几棵树，这一下午就伐了十七八棵。在另一个村上，一群老妈妈说：“八路军替咱穷人想的真到！”一个分了九亩地的贫农，摆手叫我过去对我说：“一过年就没柴烧，水都不敢喝足。”群众都说：“非这个法子不中。”这几天放哨警戒也比从前进步了，每村都放几个哨到三里地以外，他们自己分工负责各个方向。越土地改革，群众积极性越高，戒备越严，运动搞的越热烈。由于对敌人与本地坏蛋积极的进攻，土地改革运动大有开展（中组在黑夜还量地），群众情绪非常高涨，别区冀钞是一元顶一元或二元，这区是一元顶五、六元，每天各村不断的给游击队送情报。
    （十）没有彻底的土地改革，就没有群众性的游击战争
    我们深深体会到：没有彻底的土地改革，就没有群众性的游击战争。要达到这一步，必须以进攻的精神打击敌人与本地坏蛋，尽量争取公开合法的活动，肃清“惹祸”妥协的退却思想，要镇压反动分子一直到热烈的进行群众性的土地改革为止，要控制农村形势始终属于农民。
    游击战争有两门学问：一是对敌人，军事上有办法；一是对本地坏蛋，分田地有办法，基本上是集中起来应付敌情，分散开来土地改革。怎样集中怎样分散，要看敌情与敌我力量而定。领导上还得大胆的创造，路是走着通着，因之应多开动机器，注意思想领导；多主动打击敌人，多接近群众，以便得到群众的启发。这样来领导武工队逐渐由恐慌走向无畏。
