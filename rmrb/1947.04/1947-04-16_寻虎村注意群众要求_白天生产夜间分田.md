　　【Report from this newspaper in Southern Hebei, 14th】To avoid delaying the farming season and seize the spring plowing, Xunhu Village produces during the day and holds meetings at night to distribute land. The masses in Julu and Xunhu villages were showing signs of weariness with meetings to discuss land distribution issues as spring plowing approached, and their enthusiasm waned. They were reluctant to attend meetings, and few spoke up. The leadership, based on the demands of the masses, tried to shorten the time and quickly distribute the land, but the masses felt that land distribution was not an easy task, and feared problems if it was done too quickly. Finally, after discussions among the masses, it was decided that representatives and group leaders would discuss during the day while members engaged in production; in the evening, a general membership meeting would be held to study, with representatives and group leaders helping each other with their work. As a result, the enthusiasm of the masses was greatly heightened, the working time was not prolonged, energy was concentrated, the problems were discussed more quickly, and the masses happily said: "If everyone discusses, there will be good solutions; the masses are all sages."
　　【Report from this newspaper in Southern Hebei, 14th】In order to ensure that the land reform movement and large-scale inspection do not affect spring plowing, the Third District of Guantao has made the following decisions: (1) Regardless of the type of village, the land obtained as fruit of victory must be distributed within ten days to avoid leaving it uncultivated. (2) In order to solve the problem of extremely poor land in poor villages, the district-level Party, government, civilian, and military organs will cultivate 97 mu of land and distribute it to the masses, and mobilize large villages to solve the land difficulties of poor small villages. (3) When distributing the fruits of victory, attention should be paid to compensating for the losses of middle peasants and uniting with middle peasants to produce together. (4) For any remaining problems, seize the gaps during spring plowing to resolve them.

　　寻虎村注意群众要求
    白天生产夜间分田
    【本报冀南十四日电】不误农时，抓紧春耕，寻虎村白天生产，晚上开会分田。巨鹿、寻虎村群众因春耕到来，对开会讨论分配土地问题表示厌倦，情绪消沉，开会不愿去，发言的不多。领导上便依据群众要求，图缩短时间，迅速将地分出，但群众认为分地不是容易事，快了怕有毛病。最后经过群众讨论才确定白天代表、小组长讨论，会员生产；晚上开全体会员会研究，代表、小组长的活，会员互助帮忙。这样一来，群众情绪高涨了，工作时间并不拖长，精力集中，问题讨论的更快，群众喜欢的说：“大家商量，就有好办法，众人便是圣人。”
    【本报冀南十四日电】馆陶三区为使翻身大检查不影响春耕，特作出如下决定：（一）不管那种村庄，必须先把果实中之土地在十天中分配完毕，以免荒芜。（二）为解决贫苦村之赤贫土地问题，区级党政民武的机关种地九十七亩分给群众，并动员大村解决贫苦小村土地困难。（三）分果实注意弥补中农损失，团结中农一齐生产。（四）尚有遗留问题者，则抓紧春耕空隙，解决问题。
