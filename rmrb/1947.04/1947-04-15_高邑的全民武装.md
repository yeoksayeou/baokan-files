　　As soon as we stepped into the territory of Gaoyi County, we saw that each village had built three to five towering blockhouses around a group of bungalows. The blockhouses were connected to underground tunnels, and the important locations in the village had bunkers connected to the tunnels. The streets were blocked, and sky bridges were built between the bungalows. At night, militiamen and self-defense team members, armed with various weapons, took turns patrolling the blockhouses all night long. Indeed, Gaoyi had armed all its people.
　　Starting in April of last year, the masses began to recognize the importance of being armed through the bloody suppression by the puppet bandits and landlords' "Homecoming Corps." During the liquidation struggles, the masses participated in the militia in large numbers and purchased weapons. After August, villages more commonly built fortifications, blocked streets, and organized joint defense. After the second half of November, with the masses having preliminary war fortifications to rely on, the land reform movement was carried out more vigorously, forming the second upsurge of mass movement. The struggle against the enemy took a proactive turn. Combining the masses' demands for emancipation and defense of emancipation, this further promoted the development of the people's armed forces in Gaoyi.
　　Currently, in addition to a strong militia and general self-defense forces, the masses have also spontaneously organized armed self-defense teams, homemade gun teams, militia second teams, and other armed forces throughout the county. The women of Xujiazhuang have also organized themselves, and when the enemy attacks, they all go to the rooftops to assist in the battle. Many old men over fifty years old in the villages have also armed themselves.
　　With the increase in the masses' enthusiasm for self-defense, the homemade weapons movement has become widespread. When the Gaojiazhuang self-defense team repelled an enemy attack with homemade guns, it further promoted everyone's confidence in using homemade weapons. Many villages proposed "Homemade guns everywhere, rifles in a line" and "Homemade guns hit a group, rifles hit one person," and they created methods for combining the use of homemade guns and rifles. Wang Qingchang, a hero in killing the enemy, returned from the heroes' meeting in Changzhi, and the next day he created canned grenades, glass bottle grenades, etc., and test-fired homemade cannons, repelling the enemy. After being commended by the County Armed Forces Committee, a craze for making weapons swept across the county.
　　The experience of tunnel warfare was first created in Dongjiang and other three villages. Initially, due to the large scale of the project, some village cadres and masses lacked confidence. The county's various agencies first took the lead in digging tunnels, which then influenced the Chengguan District and quickly spread throughout the county. Men and women, young and old, worked together in each village. In the month around December, the tunnels in each village were all completed. Of the county's ninety-seven villages, seventy-eight had completed tunnels, and the remaining nineteen villages, due to water and sandy soil that made digging impossible, transformed the terrain instead. ×× Zhuang dug a total of 340 zhang of tunnels, costing 2,700 workdays. The masses themselves put forward encouraging slogans such as "Don't be afraid of hard work, effort will naturally succeed." During the Lunar New Year, the masses proposed, "If the tunnels are not dug well, we cannot spend a peaceful year." Work was stopped for one day on the first day of the new year, and resumed on the second day. Chengguan District dug a total of 1,800 zhang, with an average of 200 zhang per village in the county.
　　Due to the reliance on tunnels, in early February, more than a hundred puppet soldiers from Yuanshi attacked × village. Our militiamen resisted for two hours and then retreated into the tunnels. The puppet soldiers entered the village to search, but were killed two by the militiamen before fleeing in panic. Our militiamen suffered no casualties. In December of last year, our militiamen, relying on the tunnels, killed and wounded twelve enemies, intercepted 148 heads of livestock that had been robbed, 118 members of the masses, and captured 46 fleeing landlord households. Now the "Homecoming Corps" no longer dares to enter the villages casually, and our village militiamen have turned to actively attacking the enemy.

　　高邑的全民武装
    陈新
    我们一踏入高邑县境，便看到各个村庄，在一片平房的四周都建筑着三、五个高耸的炮楼。炮楼下通地道，村中各重要地点都有与地道相通的地堡，街口堵塞，各家平房间作有天桥，一到夜晚，民兵自卫队员们拿着各种各样的武器，到各个炮楼整夜轮流巡逻。的确，高邑是全民武装起来了。
    去年四月间群众开始从伪匪与地主“还乡团”的血腥镇压中，认识了武装的重要。在清算斗争中群众即大批参加民兵，购买武器，八月以后各村更普遍修工事、堵街口，组织联防，到十一月下半月以后，群众有了初步的战争工事依托，土地改革运动更轰轰烈烈的开展起来，形成第二次群运高潮，对敌斗争也从此走上主动，结合了群众翻身与保卫翻身的要求，就更加促成了高邑全民武装的发展。
    目前全县除有强大的民兵和一般自卫队外，群众并自动组织有武装自卫队、土枪队、民兵第二队等武装。徐家庄的妇女们也组织起来，当敌人进攻时都上房助战，许多村五十岁以上的老汉也都武装起来了。
    随着群众自卫热情的提高，土武器运动即普遍开展起来。当高家庄自卫队用土枪打退了敌人进攻时，更推动了大家使用土武器的信心，许多村提出是“土枪一大片，步枪一条线”、“土枪打一群，步枪打一人”，并创造土枪步枪结合使用法。杀敌英雄王庆昌从长治参加群英会回来，第二天即创造罐头雷、玻璃瓶雷等，并试装土炮，打退敌人。经县武委会通报表扬后，全县掀起了造武器的热潮。
    地道斗争的经验首先是在东江等三村创造的。初因工程太大，有些村干部群众缺乏信心，县上各机关先起了打地道的模范，接着影响了城关区，很快就普及了全县。各村都是男女老少一齐动手，在十二月前后一个月中，各村地道全部完成。全县九十七村，作好地道者七十八村，其余十九村是因水沙地不能打而改造了地形，××庄共打地道三百四十丈，费工二千七百个，群众自己提出鼓励口号“不怕费劲，工到自然成”。在过旧历年时，群众提出“打不好地道，不能过太平年”。大年初一停工一天，初二即干起来。城关区共打了一千八百丈，全县每村平均二百丈。
    由于有了地道依托，二月初旬元氏伪军百余向×村进攻，我民兵抵抗两个钟头后，即转入地道，伪军入村搜索，被民兵击毙二名，即仓惶逃窜，我民兵毫无伤亡。在去年十二月份，我民兵即依托地道打死伤敌十二名，截回被抢走牲口一四八头，群众一一八人，并捉回逃亡地主四十六户，现在“还乡团”已经不敢随便入村，而我各村民兵已转向主动向敌人出击。
