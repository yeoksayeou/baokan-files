　　[This newspaper, Taiyue, 5th dispatch] The Political Department of the Taiyue Military Region convened a meeting of hospital political work personnel on the 6th of this month to further improve hospital work. Participants, in a spirit of self-criticism, and using the mass line method of "everyone raises problems, everyone solves them," conducted a detailed review and study of past work and future guidelines and tasks. The meeting lasted half a month and concluded on the 20th. In the summary, it was first pointed out that hospital political work had made great progress last year, especially after the principle of serving convalescing personnel was put forward. Two-thirds of the staff redoubled their efforts, and the number of wounded and sick who recovered and were discharged from the hospital was over 73% of the total number, which was well received and rewarded by the convalescing personnel. At the same time, it was pointed out that promoting and implementing the service for the wounded and sick and educating the recovered to go to the front line again remains the guideline and task for future work. This principle was determined as the standard for evaluating work and all personnel. It was pointed out that a meritorious service campaign focusing on cherishing the wounded and sick, and a revenge meritorious service campaign for the wounded and sick to return to the front line, must be organized. A call was made for those who have made contributions to add to their achievements; those who have made mistakes should correct them and make amends. Regarding the leadership of meritorious service, it was determined that each department should set up a merit evaluation committee, evaluate once a month, and submit it to the soldiers' congress for approval. After the level of merit is determined, it will be recorded in the merit book and a merit list will be issued.
