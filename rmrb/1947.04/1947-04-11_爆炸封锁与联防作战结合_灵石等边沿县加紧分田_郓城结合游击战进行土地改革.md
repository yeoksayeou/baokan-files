　　Combining Explosive Blockades with Joint Defense Operations
    Lingshi and Other Border Counties Intensify Land Distribution
    Yunchang Combines Guerrilla Warfare with Land Reform
    [Reported from Taiyue by our newspaper on the 9th] After the Yuebei First Prefectural Committee called on the border areas to "hold a gun in one hand and distribute land in the other," the movement in Lingshi, Zhao City, and Jiexiu counties along the Tongpu Railway is intensifying. Lingshi has recently transferred experienced mine-laying militiamen to the front lines. The armed headquarters in Yucheng Village, Duanmuyan, and Nanwu Village (occupied by stubborn enemies) lay mines at night and fight when the enemy comes out during the day. On the second line, in addition to strong district and village cadres being transferred to Chenjiashan, Gubo, Renyi, Lijia Village, and other villages to lead the struggle, they also form joint defenses with the surrounding villages. Once enemy activity is detected, each village uses a secret signal to gather at the predetermined location to ambush. Duanmuyan has repelled enemy attacks three times; Nanwu Village has repelled them four times. Their joint defense pact is: each armed village headquarters strives to explode thirty stone mines per month. The second line supplies the first line with ××× stone mines per month. If one village is attacked, all villages provide assistance. Under this specific agreement, members of the farmers' associations in each village strive to lay one stone mine per month. Some young women in the villages compete with men in laying mines early and late, showing the great enthusiasm of the peasants in defending the fruits of their liberation. Villages such as Shitun and Beitai in Zhao City are also rapidly launching movements with the militia as the backbone. After detecting enemy activity, the militia in Shitun Village immediately covered the masses to move outside the village and continued to discuss how to deal with the landlords' land. Because × Village was too close to the enemy, some peasants were afraid to fight the landlords. The cadres mobilized them by citing the fact that the militia had fought seven battles in one day to defend the summer harvest last year, and that an enemy battalion's attack was repelled by them. As a result, the village's farmers' association was able to develop rapidly, and ××× people participated in the struggle. Longlu Village in Jiexiu started by fighting corruption in the military affairs committee, reorganizing the militia organization, and improving fighting will. It gradually improved sentry posts and intelligence. It gradually turned to settling accounts with the landlords, which gradually increased the confidence of the peasants. Activists increased from nineteen to seventy or eighty people. After the meeting, they moved from settling accounts with the landlords in their village to demanding the liquidation of the land of the landlords in the city (the land occupied by the landlords in the village). Under the influence of this village, the surrounding villages have also launched a large-scale mass movement to recover land.
    [Reported from Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region by our newspaper on the 9th] Yunchang is carrying out land reform in the midst of guerrilla warfare. Each village sends people to monitor near the enemy strongholds every day. The enemy's every move can be immediately spread throughout the district. The district headquarters can receive fifty or sixty intelligence reports from each village every day. Villages closer to the enemy not only send out scouts, but also post sentries outside the village when dividing land and grain within the village. They stop when the enemy enters the village and continue when the enemy leaves the village. Reconnaissance and intelligence work has become a habit of the masses in each village. Therefore, the district cadres do not have to worry about the enemy situation. At the same time, because the district cadres can support the masses, care for them, and relieve their suffering, the enthusiasm of the masses is increased, and it is difficult for special agents to operate.

　　爆炸封锁与联防作战结合
    灵石等边沿县加紧分田
    郓城结合游击战进行土地改革
    【本报太岳九日电】岳北一地委号召边沿区“一手拿枪，一手分田”之后，同蒲沿线灵石、赵城、介休各县运动日益开展。灵石于日前已将爆炸有经验的民兵，抽至第一线，各武装指挥部在玉成村、端目岩、南吴三村（顽占区）夜间埋雷，白天敌出就打。二道线上，除强有力的区村干部调至程家山、古柏、仁义、李家山等村领导斗争外，并与周围村庄组成联防。发现敌情后，各村均以暗号为记，奔至预定地点设伏。端目岩曾三次打退敌人进攻；南吴村则打退四次。他们的联防公约是：每个武装村指挥部，争取每月爆炸三十颗石雷。二道线每月供给头道线石雷×××颗，一村有敌，村村援助。在此具体协定下，各村农会会员，每人每月均争取打石雷一颗，有些村庄青年妇女，起早搭夜的与男人竞赛打雷，显示出农民保卫自己翻身果实的极大热情与决心。赵城师屯、北泰等村，亦以民兵武装为骨干，迅速展开运动。师屯村在发现敌情后，民兵即掩护群众一齐转移村外，依然讨论如何处理地主的土地。×村因距敌太近，部分农民不敢与地主斗争，干部即以去年保卫夏收，民兵一天曾打过七次仗，敌人一营兵力进攻，都被我们打退的事实，进行动员。结果该村农会，得以迅速发展，×××人都参加了斗争。介休龙麓村则是从武委会反贪污，整理民兵组织，提高斗争意志着手，进一步健全岗哨、情报。逐渐转到向地主清算，使农民信心亦逐步提高；积极分子由十九人扩大到七、八十人。会后并由清算本村地主转到要求清算城里地主的土地（地主在该村霸占的地）。在该村的影响下，周围村庄也已掀起大规模的群众收回土地运动。
    【本报冀鲁豫九日电】郓城某区游击战争中进行土地改革。各村每天都派人到敌据点附近监视，敌人一举一动，能立刻传遍全区，区部每天可接到各村情报五、六十份。离敌人较近的村庄，除派出侦察外，村内分地分粮时，村外亦放有岗哨，敌人进村就停止，敌人出村又继续进行。侦察情报工作已成各村群众习惯，因此区干部无须顾虑敌情，同时由于区干部能给群众撑腰，体贴和解除了群众痛苦，群众积极性提高，特务很难活动。
