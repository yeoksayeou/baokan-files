Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 10th. The Headquarters of the Northeast Democratic Allied Forces recently released a public announcement regarding the investigation and results of the capture of U.S. military officers Rigg and Collins on the Changchun front on the 1st of last month.
    After careful investigation by our forces, based on witness testimony, material evidence, and the confessions of the two U.S. military officers, it has been confirmed that these U.S. military officers were indeed captured while conducting military reconnaissance of our positions under the cover of Chiang's troops. The circumstances are as follows:
    (1) On March 1st, after our forces repelled a regiment of Chiang's troops southwest of Jiutai, the Second Battalion of a certain regiment of a certain division of our army occupied Kalun, 40 li northeast of Changchun, at 8:30 a.m. Subsequently, Deputy Company Commander Ma Ruqi of the Fifth Company of the battalion led his troops to search forward along the Ji(lin)-Chang(chun) Road. The vanguard reached Qijia Wobao (8 li southwest of Kalun), and was attacked by superior forces of Chiang's troops. Under the intense fire of Chiang's troops' 60mm mortars and machine guns, our troops voluntarily withdrew to Hexi Fort, 3 li southwest of Kalun. Immediately after deploying, a jeep was spotted driving from the northeastern mountainous area of Lijia Dian, occupied by Chiang's troops. The vehicle stopped 200 meters from our military's cordon line. Three people jumped out of the car, with a U.S. military officer in the lead, using binoculars to reconnoiter our positions. The other two followed closely, proceeding with caution. At that time, our troops had already set up an ambush. The sentry immediately ordered them to stop. One of them, seeing that they were surrounded, quickly jumped into the jeep, and drove away. Our troops immediately opened fire on the jeep, and the Chiang's troops in the northeastern mountains of Lijia Dian and Qijia Wobao simultaneously returned fire with machine guns, wounding our squad leader Wang Yucheng. They ultimately covered the jeep's escape. Our troops captured the U.S. military officers Rigg and Collins, who did not have time to escape, seizing two pistols, binoculars, cameras, and other military supplies. This occurred around noon.
    (2) After our combat troops escorted the U.S. military officers Rigg and Collins to headquarters in Harbin, a careful investigation was conducted. The former company commander Ma Ruqi, who captured them at the time, was ordered to return from the front to be questioned face to face. During the investigation, Rigg claimed to be a cavalry major, and Collins an infantry captain. Both were assistant military attachés at the U.S. Embassy in China. Collins presented a passport issued by the Chiang government's Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Rigg had no diplomatic passport, but presented a U.S. military identification card, which matched his appearance. They confessed that they were going to the front for "military observation." They stated that they had learned two days earlier that Jiutai had been occupied by our forces, and at that time the situation in Changchun was chaotic. Rigg also confessed: Before departing, he had telegraphed the U.S. Embassy in Nanjing, saying: "I will go to the front tomorrow to assess the situation." On the day of their departure, after contacting a Lieutenant Colonel Tan at the headquarters of Chiang's New First Army in Changchun, they carried full arms and several detailed maps without any permits, and drove to the front. At the front, at a Chiang's army regimental headquarters, they inquired about the military situation from Chiang's army regimental commander Yang Jinglun, and then entered our military positions for reconnaissance, and were captured by our troops. Regarding the circumstances of the capture, based on the statements of Rigg and Collins, and the testimony of Deputy Company Commander Ma Ruqi, who captured them, except for Rigg and Collins' adamant denial that the jeep was not flying a U.S. flag, the statements of both sides were consistent in all other respects, as described in the previous section of this announcement. Rigg and Collins also confessed that they "frequently traveled in Kuomintang areas, freely collecting intelligence, and could request intelligence from Kuomintang military organs." Kuomintang military organs also frequently sent them "war situation reports" and "enemy situation reports," and they could freely enter and exit the front to "collect intelligence," and so on. From this, the close military cooperation between the U.S. and Chiang can be seen. During the tense situation in Changchun, the incident of Rigg and others personally going to the front, conducting armed reconnaissance of our military situation under the cover of Chiang's troops, has been proven with ironclad evidence based on all the witness testimony, material evidence, and the personal statements of Rigg and others. At this point, the truth of the case has been revealed. The U.S. imperialist elements are aiding the Chinese traitor Chiang Kai-shek in carrying out civil war, and at this critical juncture, they do not hesitate to send U.S. diplomatic and military attachés to conduct military reconnaissance, which once again exposes the ugly face of the U.S. and Chiang colluding to attack the Chinese people. Based on the above facts, this headquarters, in addition to expressing a serious protest to the U.S. government for directly participating in the Chinese civil war and attacking the Chinese people, and warning that the U.S. government will be responsible for any consequences arising from similar actions in the future, will still, in the spirit of leniency, repatriate Rigg and Collins. We hereby announce the detailed circumstances of this case and appeal to American progressives and world public opinion to sanction the U.S. government's criminal behavior of directly helping Chiang Kai-shek carry out civil war based on international justice, and call on our people to be vigilant against the increasingly blatant conspiracy of collusion between Chiang and the U.S. to carry out traitorous civil war, rise up to save the country, oppose the vicious and insidious aggression policy of U.S. imperialism, and strive for the early realization of national independence and democratic freedom.

　　蒋军掩护向我阵地作军事侦察
    长春前线俘美军官二名
    民主联军总部揭露美助蒋内战狰狞面目
    【新华社东北十日电】东北民主联军总部，日前发布关于上月一日在长春前线俘获之美军军官芮格与柯林士二人之调查经过及其结果之公告如下：
    本军于三月一日，在长春附近河溪堡作战中，俘获美军官官芮格及柯林士二名事件，经过本军慎重调查之后，根据人证物证及两美军军官之供词，业已查明该美军军官等确系在蒋军掩护之下向我军阵地作军事侦察时被我俘获，经过情形如下：
    （一）三月一日本军在九台西南方向击退蒋军一个团后，我某师某团第二营，于上午八时半占领长春东北四十里之卡伦，随即派该营五连副连长马如起等，率部沿吉（林）长（春）路搜索前进，前锋进抵祁家窝堡（卡伦西南八里），遭蒋军优势兵力攻击，在蒋军六○炮及机枪密集射击之下，我军主动撤回卡伦西南三里之河溪堡，部署甫定，即发现吉普车一辆，由蒋军占领之李家店东北山地驶来，在距我军警戒线二百米处，该车即行停驶，车中跃出三人，为首一美军官，以望远镜向我阵地侦察，后二人尾随警戒前进，当时我军已部署伏击，前哨士兵即迫令彼等停止，其中一人见已陷我包围，迅即跳上吉普，驾车逃走，我军即向吉普开枪，而李家店东北山岭与祁家窝堡之蒋军，即同时以机枪猛烈还击，伤我军班长王玉成一名，终于掩护该吉普车逃脱，我军当将未及逃走之美军军官芮格及柯林士二名俘获，缴获短枪二支，望远镜及照像机等军用品。其时约在正午十二时左右。
    （二）我军战斗部队将美军军官芮格及柯林士解抵哈尔滨本部后即进行慎重调查，下令前方调回当时俘获彼等之前连长马如起等，当面质讯：在调查中，芮格自称系骑兵少校，柯林士则为步兵上尉，二人均系美驻华大使馆助理武官。柯林士呈验蒋政府外交部发给之护照，芮格无外交护照，呈验美军卡片身份证，经核对与本人相貌相符。彼等供认此次系赴前线进行“军事观察”。缘彼等已于两天前，往悉九台已被我军占领，当时长春情形混乱。芮格并供称：出发前曾致电南京美大使馆谓：“我明天将去前线，以便对情况作一判断。是日彼等出发前在长春蒋军新一军军部与一谭中校接洽后，即携带全副武装及精细地图数份均无执照”。驱车赶赴前线，在前线至蒋军一团级司令部向蒋军团长杨经伦询问军情后，即进入我军阵地进行侦察，当被我军俘获。关于当场被俘经过，根据芮格及柯林士之陈述以及俘虏彼等之马如起副连长之见证，除对当时吉普车未悬美旗一点，芮格与柯林士坚不承认以外，其余各节双方陈述均甚吻合，一如本公告上节所述。芮格与柯林士并供称：彼等“经常往来于国民党区域，自由采集情报，并可向国民党军事机关要求供给情报。”国民党军事机关亦经常送给“战况通报”、“敌情通报”等，彼等并可自由进出前线，“采集情报”云云。由此可见美蒋间军事合作的密切关系。此次长春吃紧中，芮格等亲身出发前线，在蒋军掩护下武装侦察我军情况之事件，根据一切人证物证及芮格等之亲口陈述，已获铁证，至此本案真象业已大白，美帝国主义分子援助中国卖国贼蒋介石进行内战，竟不惜于紧急关头派出美方外交武官从事军事侦察，实已再一次暴露美蒋狼狈为奸进攻中国人民之狰狞面目。本部根据以上事实，除向直接参加中国内战进攻中国人民之美国政府表示严重抗议，并警告以后如果有同样行动因而发生的种种后果，应由美国政府负责外，对于芮格及柯林士，仍本宽大精神予以遣送出境。兹特公布本案详细经过情形，向美国进步人士及全世界舆论呼吁，根据国际道义制裁美国政府直接帮助蒋介石进行内战的罪恶行为，并号召我国人民警惕蒋美勾结进行卖国内战愈益露骨之阴谋，奋起救国反对美帝国主义的凶恶阴毒的侵略政策，以争取民族独立与民主自由早日实现。
