　　Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 1st. Ten dangerous points on the old course of the Yellow River between Jiyang and Lijin are in imminent danger. Local democratic government personnel are actively leading residents along the river in bravely repairing the dikes, braving attacks from Chiang Kai-shek's planes. However, due to an extreme shortage of stone materials for dike repair, stone rollers and tombstones are being used as substitutes. This reporter witnessed a continuous stream of vehicles on both banks transporting bricks, stones, and straw to the dangerous points. At each dangerous point, thousands of people are working intensely in the strong wind. River worker Wang Jiayang told the reporter: "Only in this kind of weather can we repair it, when the weather is good, Chiang Kai-shek will bomb us," his words full of indignation. Jiang Weikun, Director of the River Affairs Bureau, personally went to each dangerous point to design repair methods with the river workers. The more than ten li of straw dikes in Zhang Youtang section of Putai were raised by two meters in dozens of hours thanks to the brave repair work of the masses. This reporter also inspected along the riverbed and saw that the water flow was very rapid, and the strong wind stirred up huge waves, constantly floating past the bodies of drowned people and the wood and materials of destroyed houses. Row after row of green wheat fields were also being submerged. Sixty-four villages in the Renhe District of Kenli County (located between the tributary and the main stream of the Yellow River), because the UNRRA relocation funds have been delayed, residents have not been fully relocated, and now fifty villages have suffered from flooding. The democratic government is using all ships to rush the relocation of the disaster-stricken compatriots there.

　　济阳利津间河堤告急
    渤海政民奋勇抢修
    【新华社山东一日电】黄河故道济阳、利津间已有十处险工告急。当地民主政府工作人员正积极率同沿河居民冒蒋机袭扰，奋勇抢修。但因修堤石料极缺，仅以石碾碑碣等代替。记者目击两岸车辆络绎，向险工处运送砖石、秸料，每一险工处均有数千民众在狂风中紧张工作。河工王甲扬告记者：“只有这样天气才能修，天好了蒋介石又要轰炸”，言下不胜愤慨。河务局江卫坤局长亲往各险工处与河工设计抢修办法。蒲台张有堂段十余里秸堤，在群众奋勇抢修下，数十小时内增高二公尺。记者并沿河床视察，见水流甚急，狂风卷起巨浪，不时浮过被淹死的尸体和被冲毁的房屋木料、绿油油的麦田也一陇陇的被淹没。垦利人和区六十四个村庄（位于黄河支流与主流之间），因联总迁移费迟迟未发，居民未能全部迁移，现已有五十个村庄遭受水灾。民主政府正以全部船只，抢移该处灾胞。
