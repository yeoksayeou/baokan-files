It is estimated that more than 300 enemies, including deputy battalion commanders and below, were captured, and more than 50 were killed. This is the third city recovered in the Western Manchuria region this year, following Kailu and Kulun. Note: Kangping was occupied by the Chiang army's 71st Army on August 25th of last year. At that time, the Second Northeast Ceasefire Agreement had just been signed, and the Chiang army's action of occupying Kangping was the first to tear it up.

　　西满我军收复康平
    【新华社东北九日急电】辽吉人民解放军地方武装于八日晨五时收复康平县城，尽歼蒋军三十一军骑一师及保安队共两个连。计俘敌正副大队长以下三百余，毙五十余。此为西满地区今年以来继开鲁、库伦之后收复之第三座城市。按：康平系于去年八月二十五日为蒋军七十一军所侵占，其时适为东北二次停战协定甫订，首先即为蒋军侵占康平之行动所撕毁。
