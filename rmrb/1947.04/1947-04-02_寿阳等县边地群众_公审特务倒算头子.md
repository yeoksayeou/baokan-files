[Transmitted by] This newspaper's Taihang [Mountain region] dispatch of the 31st: This month, the masses in Shouyang, Anyang, Yuci and other counties, successively organized people's courts to publicly try special agents and counter-settlement ringleaders guilty of heinous crimes. On the 18th, four thousand emancipated masses in Shouyang held a revenge meeting in × village, publicly trying the three traitors, counter-settlement ringleaders Huo Jihan, Zhang Guangtian, and Fu Zirong. Traitor Huo was a local tyrant landlord in Danao Village, Shouyang, who consistently oppressed the people and committed all kinds of evils. In 1940, he defected to the enemy and served as the director of training for the Class B police of the puppet Luan [Changzhi] regime, training special agents to suppress the anti-Japanese people. After the surrender of the Japanese invaders, Traitor Huo continued to serve as the captain of the puppet Shouyang Revenge Corps under the traitor Yan [Xishan], cruelly persecuting innocent people. From the end of December last year to the beginning of February this year alone, he murdered 15 of our cadres and masses. He organized counter-settlements, forcing the masses to return the fruits of emancipation, and frantically looting everywhere, forcibly conscripting young men, counter-settling a total of 179 *shi* of grain, more than ten head of livestock, and countless clothing items from the masses. He robbed villages in as many as 16 locations, and abducted more than 170 young men. Traitor Huo raped women everywhere, and the masses hated him to the bone. This time, he was captured alive along with Traitor Nie Guangtian (Third Squad Leader of the Revenge Corps) and Traitor Fu Zirong. The masses all held extremely resentful feelings. The area around the court that tried the three traitors was covered with pictures and slogans depicting Traitor Huo's atrocities, which further stirred up everyone's pain. Huo Chengde angrily said: "Huo Jihan chopped my father three times in the waist, stabbed him more than ninety times. I put my father in a coffin, but Huo Jihan split the coffin open a second time and dragged the dead man out. I want revenge!" Wen Xueyi pointed at Traitor Huo and said: "You killed my entire family of five, what a black heart?!" An old, sick man from Jingshang Village also rushed to the meeting despite his illness to complain. The masses accused Traitor Huo of his atrocities one after another, and questioned him. Traitor Huo lowered his head and remained silent. The crowd was outraged, and the three traitors were executed. The court sentenced Wu Siyin, Li Guixiao, and others, who had been deceived by Traitor Huo, to imprisonment or released them separately. The big counter-settlement landlords Li Zilai and Wang Liuzhi of the Third District of Anyang were captured by the militia and handed over to the masses for public trial. Relying on the power of the enemy and the puppet regime, these two local tyrants once ran rampant, wantonly extorting from the people. Ren Lin's father was forced to death because he was extorted 400,000 yuan. There were more than forty counter-settlement cases. At the public trial on the 17th, more than 700 masses who participated in the public trial were grief-stricken and lost their voices when they talked about the pain. They unanimously shouted for the execution of the two local tyrants. The government responded to the demands of the masses and sentenced the two traitors to death. Zhang Erhuo, a big local tyrant and evil landlord in Haodu Village, Fourth District of Yuci, was also released on the 14th. The armed work team of the district crossed the railway and broke into Guozi Village, capturing and executing the traitor, much to the satisfaction of the people.
