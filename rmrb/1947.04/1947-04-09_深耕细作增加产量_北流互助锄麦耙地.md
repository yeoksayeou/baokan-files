　　Deep Ploughing and Meticulous Cultivation Increase Yields
  　Beiliu Mutual Aid Hoes Wheat and Harrows Land
    [Report from Licheng by Our Newspaper] In order to increase production through deep ploughing and meticulous cultivation, Beiliu Village convened a meeting on the night of the 2nd of this month, gathering production team leaders and members at the village school to study how to carry out wheat hoeing and land harrowing throughout the village. First, the village's Agricultural Technology Committee introduced the four benefits of hoeing wheat: (1) Hoed wheat fields are drought-resistant. (2) It can remove weeds and loosen the topsoil, making the wheat seedlings grow vigorously. (3) The wheat ears can all grow evenly. (4) The harvest is of good quality, the seeds are heavy, and more flour can be milled. Harrowing autumn fields can remove clods, making it easier to sow and easier for seedlings to emerge. After the introduction, everyone discussed and thought this was appropriate. Using calculation methods, they formulated a plan: the village has 166 male full laborers and 45 livestock. Each livestock requires one full laborer to harrow the land, and half-laborers lead the livestock. The village has a total of 2,229.4 mu of autumn fields. Each livestock can harrow an average of 10 mu of land per day, so 450 mu of land can be harrowed per day. Within six days, all the village's autumn fields can be harrowed. Regarding wheat hoeing: the village has 166 male laborers. Besides the 45 harrowing, all the remaining laborers participate in wheat hoeing. Each person can hoe an average of one mu per day, so 121 people can hoe 121 mu of wheat per day. The village's wheat fields total 709.4 mu, and all can be hoed within five days. If some teams cannot finish hoeing, the whole village can implement a large-scale labor exchange. After the meeting, everyone said, "Last year, our village achieved 'plough one, surplus one' and still increased production by 400 dan of millet. This year, we must achieve 'plough one, surplus two.'" The militiamen said, "Quickly harrow the land and hoe the wheat fields. We also have to participate in the war, to defend our Chairman Mao and eliminate the traitor Chiang Kai-shek!" By the next day, all the groups and teams in the village were involved in the wheat hoeing and land harrowing movement.

　　深耕细作增加产量
  　北流互助锄麦耙地
    【本报黎城讯】北流村为了深耕细作增加生产，本月二号夜召集各生产大队长与队员在民校研究全村如何进行锄麦耙地。先由本村农业技术委员会介绍锄麦的四点好处：（一）锄了的麦地耐旱。（二）能去草松地皮，麦苗旺。（三）麦穗都能长的齐整。（四）收量成色好，籽重多磨面。秋地耙了能去圪垃，好下种，好捉苗。介绍后让大家研究讨论，都认为这样做合适，用计算方法订出计划：全村男全劳力一百六十六个，牲口四十五头，每头去一个全劳力耙地，半劳力牵牲口，全村共有秋地两千二百廿九亩四分，每头牲口每天平均耙地十亩，每天可耙地四百五十亩，六天内可将全村秋田耙完。锄麦方面：全村男劳力一百六十六个，除了四十五个耙地外，其余劳力全部参加锄麦，每人每天平均锄一亩，一百廿一人每天可锄麦一百廿一亩，全村麦田七百零九亩四分，五天可全数锄完，如有的组锄不完，全村还可实行大变工。会后大家都说：“咱村去年达到了耕一余一还长四百大石小米，今年总要达到耕一余二。”民兵说：“赶快把地耙完，麦田锄完，咱们还要去参战，要保卫咱们毛主席，消灭卖国贼蒋介石哩！”到第二天，全村各组各队都卷入锄麦耙地运动。
