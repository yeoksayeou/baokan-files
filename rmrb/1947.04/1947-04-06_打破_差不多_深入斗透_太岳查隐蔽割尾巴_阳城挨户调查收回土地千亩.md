[By our correspondent in Taiyue, 4th] In areas where land reform has been initially completed throughout the region, reinvestigations have been launched one after another. After the general liquidation last winter in the Sixth District of Yangcheng, most cadres felt it was "almost there." However, after in-depth household investigations in March, it was discovered that landlords were concealing a considerable amount of feudal property through various means, such as family divisions, mortgages, land sales, and false declarations of enlightenment. Consequently, the masses were further mobilized to cut off tails, recovering a total of more than 1,110 mu of land. Zhang Xiaozhi, a landlord in Chaigeda, allocated 13 mu of land to his elder brother, Zhang Sanhui, during the rent reduction in 1944. After Zhang Xiaozhi was liquidated by the masses last winter, Zhang Sanhui used the 13 mu of land to support Zhang Xiaozhi's entire family. Landlords Zhang Jilian of Jide Village and Wang Yingnai of Songshumiao Village both transferred land to their daughters or cousins. Landlords Shangguan Ling and Shangguan Guangyuan of Yanshan concealed more than 30 mu of land through false mortgages. Liu Rongzhang, a landlord in Hujia, "enlightened" 40 mu of land to tenant farmers in 1944 but continued to collect rent from the tenants every autumn. After this reinvestigation, all the land was redistributed to land-poor farmers except for what was left for the landlords to live on. During the reinvestigation, the aim is not only to eliminate the feudal economy but also to sweep away all kinds of feudal vestiges politically. The masses in Shimin Mazhuang proposed "fighting for prestige" to thoroughly sweep away feudal arrogance (which is a slogan reflecting the peasants' demand for political liberation from feudal oppression). Currently, with the start of spring plowing, reinvestigations in various places are mostly combined with spring plowing. Shimin Mazhuang has organized mixed teams combining reinvestigation and production, delivering manure and plowing the land during the day, and investigating feudalism and conducting struggles in the evening. Dayang Village in Jincheng is combining the reinvestigation with the clearing of old stored fruits to solve the livestock problem.

　　打破“差不多”深入斗透
  　太岳查隐蔽割尾巴
  　阳城挨户调查收回土地千亩
    【本报太岳四日电】全区初步完成土地改革的地区，皆先后展开复查。阳城六区经过去冬总清算，一般干部都认为“差不多”了，经三月份逐户深入调查，发现地主以分家、典、卖地、假开明等多种形式，隐蔽着不少封建财产，乃继续发动群众割尾巴，共收回土地一千一百一十余亩。柴圪瘩地主张小资，在三十三年减租时拨给其兄张三会十三亩土地，去冬张小资被群众清算后，张三会即用十三亩地养活张小资全家。吉德村地主张继连、松树庙村王应鼐，皆将土地拨给其女或表兄弟。岩山地主上官岭、上官广元以假典隐藏土地三十余亩。护驾地主刘荣章三十三年“开明”给佃户四十余亩地，每年秋天仍向佃户收租。此次复查后，除给地主留生活外，余皆填补给少地农民。复查中，不仅要消灭封建经济，而且要从政治上一扫各种封建遗毒。士敏马庄群众提出“斗威风”，以求彻底扫清封建气焰（即系农民要求政治上解除封建压迫的一种口号）。目前春耕开始，各地复查多与春耕结合。士敏马庄组织复查与生产结合的混合小组，白天送粪、犁地，晚上查封建进行斗争。晋城大阳村在复查中结合清理旧存果实，解决牲口问题。
