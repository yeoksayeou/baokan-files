　　【From the Jilu Yu Front, this newspaper, 13th.】 Frontline reporter Wu Xiang reported on the recovery of Yanjin by General Liu Bocheng's troops, stating: The Jiang-affiliated county government and security regiment learned on the evening of the 27th of last month that the Eighth Route Army was approaching and hastily abandoned the city, fleeing west. At dawn, seeing that the city was not surrounded, they sneaked back. Soldiers from a certain regiment of the People's Liberation Army fired a few shots near the city, and the Jiang army exclaimed, "They're here, they're here!" They fled in a panic before they could finish their meals. Yanjin was thus liberated. The county's chief judge, Yan Shougu, and the judicial office secretary, along with seven others, were captured southwest of the city, along with large carts full of suitcases, jewelry, silks, fish, and meat. The reporter entered the city at noon and saw Eighth Route Army sentries at the city gates, blockhouses, and street corners, but no armed personnel were moving about. Several villagers guided comrades from the political department of Regiment × to search public institutions, and another villager reported that the Jiang army had a large amount of wheat and rifles in the east street. When the reporter entered the Jiang-affiliated county government, there was a striking blue slogan at the entrance: "Establish an honest government." However, the "honest" officials took away large amounts of silk and meat when they fled. County Magistrate Wu Junling had taken all the valuables from his residence, but the official documents were scattered all over the floor. A delicate little alarm clock in the corner was still ticking, as if lamenting why it was abandoned like the official documents. Ren Dexiang, a citizen who helped investigate the Jiang puppet organs, said warmly: "With the Eighth Route Army here, we don't have to pay so many donations and taxes." The reporter left the city at 3:00 PM. By this time, the poor citizens of Yanjin had received more than 10,000 catties of wheat. They happily carried the heavy bags home. Villagers from Lizhuang and other villages in the east of the city also pushed carts to help the Eighth Route Army transport the seized materials.

　　延津收复经过
    吴象
    【本报冀鲁豫前线十三日电】前线记者吴象报导刘伯承将军所部收复延津之经过称：该县蒋记县府及保安团于上月二十七日晚侦知八路军逼近，仓慌弃城西遁，黎明见城并未被围，又偷偷溜回。人民解放军某团哨兵到城边打了几枪，蒋军惊呼：“来了，来了”，饭碗未及放下，再次狼狈奔逃。延津城遂告光复。该县主任审判官燕受古及司法处书记等七人，连同满载皮箱首饰绸缎鱼肉等物之大车，在城西南被俘获。记者于正午入城巡视，见城门碉楼街口均是八路军哨兵，街上却无武装人员来往，几个老乡指引着×团政治处的同志去搜查公共机关，又一个老乡来报告东街有蒋军大批麦子和步枪。记者走进蒋记县府时，路口写着触目的蓝色大字：“建立廉洁的政府”，但“廉洁”的官员逃跑时，却带着大批绸缎和鱼肉。县长巫峻岭住房里的细软之物已全部带走了，公文卷宗却狼藉满地，角落里一架精练的小闹钟，还在的＠的＠的响，似乎是叹息为什么也像公文一样被遗弃了。帮助清查蒋伪机关的市民任德祥亲热的说：“八路军来了，我们不用出那么多捐和税了。”记者于下午三时离城，这时延津贫苦市民已分得了一万多斤麦子。他们喜悦的扛着沉重的布袋回家。城东李庄等村的老乡，亦推着小车来帮八路军搬运缴获的物资。
