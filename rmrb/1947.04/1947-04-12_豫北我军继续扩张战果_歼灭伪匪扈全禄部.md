　　Our Army in Northern Henan Continues to Expand Victories
    Annihilating the Bandit Forces of the Puppet Hù Quánlù
    [This newspaper's front line in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region, 10th dispatch] After our Northern Henan People's Liberation Army recovered Qí County, it expanded its victories by pursuing the fleeing enemy. On April 5th, it annihilated the habitual bandits of Northern Henan, led by Hù Quánlù, who had been stationed in the Xiaotun and Pangzhuang areas west of the Jùn County railway station for more than ten years. These bandits had previously recognized the enemy as their father, willingly serving as puppet troops. They transformed themselves into the Hù Quánlù unit of the Nationalist Army's Security Regiment. Over 200 were killed or wounded, and more than 800 were captured, including battalion commanders and deputy battalion commanders. The seized supplies included three mortars, forty light and heavy machine guns, over 500 rifles and carbines, over 20 Mauser pistols, over 20,000 rounds of ammunition, a radio station, over 60 mules and horses, 35,000 kilograms of salt, 8,000 *shi* of grain, and the entire arsenal, as well as numerous other military supplies. (*Shi* is an ancient measurement unit.)
