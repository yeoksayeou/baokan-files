    Village Cadres Deepen Leadership in Groups
    Yuanqu Completes Planting on Slopes
    Liberated Poor and Hired Peasants Take the Lead in Getting Rich
    Middle Peasants Break Through Ideological Concerns
    [Our newspaper, Shexian News] After the masses in Yuanqu Village, Fifth District, broke through ideological concerns about getting rich, they proposed the slogan: "Men fight Lao Jiang in the front, women plow the slopes and plant seedlings and weed wheat at home." The whole village was organized to carry out a crash program of planting and weeding. Within half a month, they had completed weeding wheat, planting in slopes and valleys, and filling gaps and building ridges on flat land. During this period, many women participated in labor. For example, the woman Feng Shuzhi led fourteen women and weeded thirty mu of wheat fields in one day, breaking the idea that women are not useful. The productive enthusiasm of the 319 liberated peasant households was particularly high. As Yue Erhe said: "In the past, I suffered for the landlord Yue Laoji for a lifetime, and I ended up with a 'qi dan' disease (foot injury). Even if I suffered for a lifetime, I couldn't live well. Last year, we struggled against the landlord, and I also got 1.2 mu of flat land. Time has passed, as long as we work hard, we don't have to worry about living a good life." Wu Chuncai said: "This year I am different from before, the land has become my own, I must work hard, and I, this old man, must also cooperate with them." Cui Eryi said: "Although there are many chores this year, there is no idle person in the village. Like in the past, no matter how busy production was, there were always many lazy people and hooligans sitting in piles on the streets every day. Now these people are also working hard." Under the slogan "Liberation is just lifting the stone slab, getting rich still depends on production," more than 300 poor and hired peasant households poured into mutual aid groups within three days. In the past, the poor and hired peasants who never wanted to participate in mutual aid, such as Shen Qingxian, Yue Erhe, Qin Xuezhong, Qin Zhizhu, etc., actively participated in mutual aid, uniting the middle peasants, and leading the old men and women. Most of them became group leaders of the mutual aid groups. And the middle peasants also broke through ideological concerns and dared to get rich. For example, the middle peasant Huang Qiming said: "In the past, I was afraid because I didn't understand. Now I understand that the things that middle peasants labor for are not struggled against. Our village's middle peasant Wu Shoufa, took things out during the movement last year, but the masses didn't want them, saying that he started his business through labor. This year, I am not only not afraid, but I also want to work hard." The reason why the spring plowing work in Yuanqu was carried out was that the village cadres played a role in promoting it. They all changed their style and actually led the production movement. For example, Shen Zhixian reviewed his past shortcomings of only talking empty words and not doing practical things, and proposed to personally take action this year to mobilize the poor and hired peasants to lead the masses in production. After his individual mobilization, he organized fourteen women and personally led them for one day, weeding thirty mu of wheat. Secondly, cadres such as Shen Mingxiu, Chen Xiangjun, Chen Quancheng, Yang Tieling, and Qin Junyao also went deep into the groups to lead the masses in production. In the past, the organization of mutual aid had a phenomenon of forced compilation. This year, it is about enlightening class consciousness and production consciousness. For example, when Shen Mingxiu mobilized Cheng Laoer, Cheng Laoer said: "We have suffered for the landlord for a lifetime in the past. This year, we have some land, but we are old, and we will live a good life." Shen Mingxiu said: "If we help each other, we can divide the heavy and light work, and even if we are old, we won't do less." Cheng Laoer said: "If that's the case, it will be adjusted, and we don't have to worry about our lives!" After returning, he mobilized five people to help each other. In the past, cadres only led in a general way in production, and did not know who to focus on. Last year, in the production movement, a landlord was mistakenly regarded as a production model. As a result, after being struggled against in the winter, the mutual aid group also collapsed. After this year's conscious self-education movement, the cadres clarified their class viewpoints, and only by helping the poor and hired peasants unite the middle peasants and achieve "cultivating three and saving one" in production can the whole village be well-fed and clothed. For example, Shen Mingxiu mobilized Yue Erhe to actively participate in mutual aid, Wang Ershun did not know how to plan his time, and the village chief Yang Tieling helped him make a plan. Poor and hired women did not have spinning tools, so the cooperative made seven hand-operated machines to help poor women spin. Now they are helping the poor and hired, adjusting seeds and farm tools. (Yuanqu Communications Group)

    村干深入小组领导
    原曲完成坡地下种
    翻身贫雇带头发家
    中农打破思想顾虑
    【本报涉县讯】五区原曲村群众打破怕发家思想顾虑后，提出：“男人前头打老蒋，妇女在家刨坡下种锄麦秧”的口号，全村组织起来，进行突击下种锄苗。在半月内，已完成了锄麦、坡谷下种以及平地补边搭圪岭。在这期间，许多妇女都参加劳动，像妇女冯书枝带领十四个妇女，一天锄了三十亩麦地，打破了认为妇女不顶事的思想，三百十九户翻身农民，生产情绪尤其高涨，如岳二和说：“过去我给地主岳老吉受苦一辈子，落了一个气蛋病（足伤），受一辈子也好过不了。去年咱们斗争地主，我也分了一亩二分平地，时光也就有了个过头了，只要咱好好受，不愁过好时光。”武春财说：“我今年和以前可不一样了，土地成了自已的啦，再要好好受，我这老汉也要和他们互助起来。”崔二义说：“今年虽然差务多，可是村上没有闲人啦，像往常年不论生产怎样忙吧，村上的懒汉和流氓有多少，每天总是在街上一堆一堆的坐着，现在这些人也都受极了。”在“翻身只是揭石板，发家还得靠生产”的口号下，有三百多户贫雇农都在三天内涌入互助组。往年根本不想参加互助的贫雇，如申清贤、岳二和、秦学忠、秦之柱等，都积极参加了互助，团结中农，带领老汉妇女，他们大部都变成了互助组的小组长。而中农也打破思想顾虑，敢发家致富。如中农黄起明说：“过去害怕是咱懂不得，现在我懂得，中农劳动的东西不斗争，咱村中农吴守法，去年运动时往外拿东西，群众不要，说他是劳动起家，我今年不但不害怕，还要好好闹时光。”原曲春耕工作之所以开展，村干起了推动作用，他们都转变作风，实际领导生产运动。如申致贤检讨他过去光说空话不做实际事的缺点，提出今年亲自动手，发动贫雇带领群众进行生产。经过他个别动员，组织起十四个妇女，亲自带领一天，锄了卅亩麦子。其次像申明秀、陈相君、陈全成、杨铁亭、秦俊要等干部，都深入小组，领导群众生产。过去组织互助，有强制编制现象，今年是启发阶级自觉和生产自觉。如申明秀发动程老二时，程老二说：“咱过去整给地主受了一辈子，今年到是有了些土地，就是老了，也做好了生活。”申明秀说：“互助起来分开轻重生活，老了也不少做。”程老二说：“要是这样吧，也就调剂开了，咱的生活到也不用发愁啦！”回去后，即动员了五个人互助起来。过去生产中干部只是笼统的领导，不知道以谁为主，去年在生产运动中，把一个地主误认为生产模范，结果到冬天被斗争后，互助组也垮了台。经过今年的自觉自教运动，干部明确阶级观点，只有帮助贫雇农团结中农，在生产中达到耕三余一，全村才能得到丰衣足食。如申明秀发动岳二和积极的参加了互助，王二顺不会打算时光，村长杨铁亭帮助他订了计划，贫雇妇女没有纺织工具，合作社即做了七架手拉机，帮助贫苦妇女纺织。现在正在帮助贫雇，调剂种籽和农具。（原曲通讯小组）
