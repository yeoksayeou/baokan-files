　　【Benbao JiluYu 7th Dispatch】 (Delayed) In mid-March, the anti-enemy guerrilla warfare in the rear of the Fourth Military Sub-district of JiluYu achieved significant results, annihilating over 200 enemies including Gao Qiangbin, the deputy brigade commander of the 127th Brigade of the 47th Division. The deputy commander of the military sub-district personally led troops in and out of the enemy's heartland in the Hua (County) Chang (Yuan) area. Although the enemy repeatedly concentrated all its forces to "encircle and suppress" us, they were all crushed by us. On the 12th, the enemy encircled Wangxing (18 li southwest of Puyang) from four directions, and was counterattacked by us, resulting in eight enemy deaths. On the 15th, we ambushed Qin Zhuang, two li south of Wangdi on the Yan (Jin) Ji (County) Highway. In a half-hour battle, we captured Gao Qiangbin, the major general deputy brigade commander of the 127th Brigade of the 47th Division, and Song Zuzong, the lieutenant colonel chief of the staff section, along with 18 others, and killed seven including a deputy regimental commander, seizing a vehicle and some weapons. On the 16th, the enemy's regular army, the 366th and 370th Regiments, attacked Kangzhuang and Shagudui (south of Puyang), the station of one of our regiments, and were blocked by us, resulting in over a hundred enemy deaths and captures, including commanders. On the 17th, our Kunwu Brigade completely annihilated the entire 7th Company of Ding Shuben's 3rd Brigade, the stubborn commissioner of Jizhai (3 li southwest of Puyang), capturing 66 people without any casualties on our side.
    【Benbao JiluYu Frontline 7th Dispatch】The guerrilla corps behind enemy lines south of the Yellow River shattered Chiang Kai-shek's puppet "mopping-up" operations. Militias and guerrillas active in the Kaocheng area, from February 14th to 21st, persisted in guerrilla warfare, eliminating over 30 enemy soldiers including company commanders, seizing two carts and some other supplies. On March 15th, Chiang Kai-shek's 143rd Brigade, in coordination with the puppet Huang Yuzhen's troops, "swept" the Kaocheng area. The local militias and guerrillas flexibly jumped to the outer lines and launched a counter-"sweeping" campaign. In eight days of fighting, the guerrillas suffered no casualties. The guerrillas of the Fifth Military Sub-district carried out counter-sweeping operations in Heze, repelling Chiang Kai-shek's 143rd Brigade's 541st Regiment, 543rd Regiment, and puppet army Zhang Kuisheng's troops. These Chiang Kai-shek and puppet troops went out every day to grab grain, but were attacked by the guerrillas everywhere. Up to the 21st of last month, the guerrillas eliminated a total of 44 enemy soldiers, seized 32 rifles, 1 machine gun, 1,800 rounds of ammunition, and 10 carts.
