Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 10th: The Dazhong Daily here recently published the news of the victory at Libao in a prominent position and published an editorial stating: The victory at Libao proves that today the military and civilians behind Chiang are not only able to persist and develop, but also able to gather strength to seek out enemy weaknesses and take the initiative to annihilate the enemy in important areas. The significance of this change is extremely important. It exposes the emptiness of Chiang's rear, and Chiang's army is overwhelmed and unable to cope. Its limited forces on the East China battlefield are focused on the desperate "offensive" on the Jinpu and Longhai lines, leaving the defense of the occupied areas in East China unattended. In the occupied areas of Central China, focusing on the defense and "suppression" of one area leaves the defense and "suppression" of another area unattended, thus giving the military and civilians behind Chiang in Central China frequent opportunities for favorable counterattacks. The editorial continued: The victory at Libao is a signal that the war situation behind Chiang has begun to change. With the continued struggle of the heroic military and civilians behind Chiang and their continued efforts to seek favorable conditions to organize counterattacks, this change will develop more rapidly until it cooperates with the frontal counteroffensive to completely recover the lost territory. At the same time, the changes in the war situation behind Chiang in Central Jiangsu and even Central China are a facet of the changing overall war situation on the East China front. After suffering disastrous defeats in the Subei Campaign, the Lunan Campaign, and especially the Laiwu Campaign, Chiang's army is like a wounded beast, blindly rushing around and eager to bite people. While it is rushing back and forth on the Jinpu Line, the heroic military and civilians behind Chiang in Central Jiangsu gave Chiang's army a heavy blow to the flank. Chen Yi and Su Yu, the ever-victorious field army of the East China People's Liberation Army, will be able to wait at their leisure and give Chiang's army an even heavier blow on the front. In this way, the rear behind Chiang and the front will complement each other, making Chiang's army stretched thin and even more trapped in a difficult situation. The editorial emphasized: The victory in Central Jiangsu is the result of persisting in defending positions and fighting the enemy for a long time.

Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 12th: A reporter from the Central Jiangsu branch recently published a commentary on the great victory of the People's Liberation Army in Central Jiangsu on the Hai'an and Rugao lines, stating: Chiang's army behind Chiang in Central Jiangsu has completely fallen into a passive position, and Chiang Kai-shek's plan to complete the "suppression" of Central Jiangsu by the end of April has become a bubble. The reporter said: Just as Chiang's army was carrying out a "full-scale suppression," frantically burning, killing, and looting in eight counties in southern Central Jiangsu, including Taizhou, Taixing, Rugao, Jingjiang, Nantong, Haimen, Qidong, and Rudong, the People's Liberation Army in Central Jiangsu launched an unprecedentedly powerful offensive on the Hai'an and Rugao lines since the seven battles and seven victories. In order to cope with this powerful offensive, Chiang's army transferred "suppression" troops from more than a hundred miles away to reinforce them. These included the entire 235th Regiment of the 79th Brigade of the 49th Division stationed in Rugao, Juegang, Matang, and Nantong, and a part of the 237th Regiment, the 315th Regiment of the 105th Brigade of the 49th Division stationed on the Rugao-Huangqiao line and the Rugao-Hai'an line, and the 304th Regiment of the 102nd Brigade of the 4th Division stationed in Jiangyan, a major town on the Hai'an-Taizhou line. They rushed around day and night, exhausted, and as a result, the 237th Regiment was completely annihilated by the People's Liberation Army, more than 400 soldiers of the 315th Regiment were annihilated, more than half of the 235th Regiment were annihilated, and a battalion of the 304th Regiment suffered heavy casualties. This fully shows that the People's Liberation Army in Central Jiangsu not only has the strength to persist in and crush Chiang's army's "suppression," but also can make Chiang's army completely passive and finally eliminate Chiang's army. Secondly, the scale of the battle was unprecedentedly enlarged. In three days and nights, more than 2,400 Chiang's troops were annihilated (including more than 2,700 Chiang's puppet troops), 11 strongholds were recovered, 3,000 square miles of land were liberated, more than 100 miles of blockade lines were opened, and hundreds of bunkers were destroyed, containing three brigades and a total of four regiments and one artillery battalion of Chiang's army. Although the ever-defeated General Wang Tiehan personally commanded the battle, he was defeated even more miserably than last time. After the main force of Chiang's army was concentrated on the Hai'an and Rugao lines, the local armed forces in various places cooperated effectively with the Hai'an and Rugao line battles and launched attacks everywhere, achieving great victories. It is estimated that from the 28th of last month to the 6th of this month, in nine days, eight strongholds such as Shizhuang Zhoujiazhuang were recovered, 401 Chiang's puppet troops were killed, wounded, and captured, 177 rifles and 13 light machine guns were seized, nearly 10,000 rounds of ammunition were seized, and 16 bunkers were destroyed. These also show that Chiang's army has completely fallen into a passive position. Now the "suppression" plan of Chiang's army in the Tong (Nantong), Ru (Rugao), Hai (Haimen), and Qi (Qidong) areas has been broken, and its "suppression" in the Jing (Jiangyin), Ru (Rugao), Tai (Taizhou), and Tai (Taixing) areas south of the Hai'an and Taizhou lines has also been forced to temporarily halt.

### 苏中李堡之捷证明：  敌后战局开始变化  蒋军完全陷入被动

　　苏中李堡之捷证明：
    敌后战局开始变化
    蒋军完全陷入被动
    【新华社山东十日电】此间大众日报顷以首条地位刊出李堡之捷，并发表社论称：李堡之捷，证明了今天蒋后军民已经不仅能够坚持、发展，而且能够集结力量寻求敌人弱点，在重要地区主动歼敌。这个变化的意义是极其重大的，它暴露了蒋后空虚，蒋军顾此失彼狼狈不堪；它在华东战场上的有限兵力顾到津浦线、陇海线的绝望“攻势”，就顾不到华东侵占区的守备；在华中侵占区则是顾到此一地区的守备和“清剿”；就顾不到彼一地区的守备和“清剿”，因此给华中蒋后军民以经常有利反击的机会。社论继称：李堡之捷是蒋后战局开始变化的信号，在蒋后英勇军民的继续斗争与继续寻求有利条件组织反击的情况下，这个变化就会更快的发展，直到配合正面反攻，全部收复失地。同时苏中以至华中蒋后战局的变化，又是整个华东正面战局正在变化的一个侧面。蒋军在宿北战役、鲁南战役特别是莱芜战役惨败后，正像受了伤的野兽蒙着眼睛乱撞乱窜，急于咬人，并正在津浦线狼奔豕突的时候，蒋后苏中英勇军民在李堡给蒋军侧背狠狠一击，华东人民解放军陈毅将军，粟裕将军的常胜野战大军更能以逸待劳，给蒋军正面以更重的一击。如此，蒋后与正面配合相互辉映，必使蒋军捉襟见肘，更加陷于窘境。社论强调指出：苏中这一胜利，乃是坚持阵地与敌周旋长期斗争的结果。
    【新华社华中十二日电】苏中分社记者顷就海（安）、＠（茶）线苏中人民解放军大胜，对目前苏中形势发表评论称：苏中蒋后蒋军已完全陷入被动，蒋介石企图在四月底完成“清剿”苏中的计划已成泡影。记者称：正当蒋军在苏中南部泰州、泰兴、如皋、靖江、南通、海门、启东、如东等八县进行“全面清剿”疯狂烧杀抢掠时，苏中人民解放军于海（安）、＠（茶）线发动了七战七捷以来之空前强大攻势，蒋军为应付这一强大攻势，抽调远在百里以外的“清剿”部队增援，计有驻如（皋）掘（港）、马（塘）南（通）各线的四十九师七十九旅二三五团全部及二三七团一部，驻如（皋）黄（桥）线及如（皋）海（安）线四十九师一○五旅三一五团，驻海（安）泰（州）线上姜堰重镇的四师一○二旅三○四团等部，星夜奔波，疲惫不堪，结果二三七团被解放军彻底歼灭，三一五团被歼四百余名，二三五团被歼过半，三○四团一个营伤亡甚重，充分说明苏中人民解放军不但有力量坚持与粉碎蒋军之“清剿”，而且能够使蒋军完全被动，最后消灭蒋军。其次，在战役规模上空前增大，三昼夜歼灭蒋军二千四百（按连蒋伪军共达二千七百）余名，收复据点十一处，解放土地三千平方里，而且打开封锁线百余里，摧毁碉堡数百座，牵制蒋军三个旅共四个团一个炮兵营。常败将军王铁汉虽亲临阵地指挥，但比上次败得更惨。蒋军主力集中海（安）＠（茶）线后，各地地方武装有力的配合海（安）＠（茶）线战役到处出击，已获巨大胜利。计自上月二十八日至本月六日九天内即收复石庄周家庄等八个据点，毙伤俘蒋伪军四百零一人，缴步枪一七七枝，轻机枪十三挺，子弹近万发，摧毁碉堡十六座，这些又说明蒋军已全面陷入被动。现通（南通）如（皋）海（门）启（东）地区之蒋军“清剿”计划已被打破，其在海（安）泰（州）线南之靖（江）如（皋）泰（州）泰（兴）地区之“清剿”亦被迫暂时停顿。
