　　The Small Textile Factory in Xia Village
    Fan Renqing, Li Longxing

Since the small textile factory in Xia Village, Licheng, was organized and rectified in October of last year, it has become the highest organizational form for improving technology and increasing textile efficiency. To summarize, in the three months of last winter, only twenty-one people participated in spinning, yet they earned a profit of 60,000 yuan. Based on this profit, Wang Mingde, the manager of the small textile factory, Li Xiulian, the textile hero, and Wang Chongwen, the head of the cooperative, began gathering women on the second day of the first lunar month to discuss issues such as expanding and consolidating the small textile factory. After more than half a month of research and rectification, it has now been formally organized and expanded. The organization, leadership, and equivalent distribution of dividends within are introduced separately below:

Organization and Leadership – The highest organization leadership is the Management Committee, composed of ten people: the village chief, the political director, the head of the cooperative, the women's rescue secretary, one person from the textile committee, two parent representatives, three student representatives, and the factory manager. The factory is equipped with a management team, with three leaders in charge of guiding textile production and learning within the factory. There are a total of seventy-two students divided into nine groups. Each of the three leaders is responsible for leading the textile work of three groups. Li Xiulian is the leader of the small textile factory.

Piecework and the Use of Work Tickets – In order to improve technology and strengthen labor efficiency, the students, after democratic discussion, determined that piecework is: spinning one catty of special-grade yarn is 48 points, first-grade yarn is 40 points, second-grade yarn is 36 points, third-grade yarn is 28 points, sizing one catty of yarn is 4 points, winding one catty of sized yarn is 4 points, winding one catty of patterned yarn is 3 points, warping one zhang of cloth is 2.5 points, shuttle insertion on the machine is 12 points, making one catty of tassels is 3 points, weaving one chi of cloth is 1 point, weaving one towel is 1.5 points, weaving one chi of bedding cover is 2 points, and each point of work earns 15 yuan. In the method of recording work, work tickets are used uniformly. Work tickets are divided into three grades. Weaving first-grade cloth earns first-grade work tickets, second-grade cloth earns second-grade work tickets, and third-grade cloth earns third-grade work tickets. Every evening, the leader on duty leads everyone to discuss and determine the distribution of work tickets and dividends.

Last winter, the capital was 41,000 yuan, and in the first month of this year, another 60,000 yuan was newly added, making a total of 101,000 yuan of share capital. There are a total of textile tools: 12 looms (including one iron loom and one towel loom), 21 spinning wheels, and four winding machines. In terms of dividend distribution, in addition to wages, women who participate in the textile factory's labor receive 45% for labor, 30% for capital, 20% for tools, and 5% for bonuses. The wages and dividends earned by women's labor are generally divided with the family in a 70/30 split (women 70%, family 30%), while others divide with the family in a 20/80 or 40/60 split.

After rectification and expansion, and discussion of equivalent dividend distribution, a hundred-day textile plan for the small factory was formulated. All 72 women in the factory will complete 7 catties of native cloth each month, totaling 1,688.5 catties in a hundred days. Within one month, ten women will learn to weave towels, and the 21 spinning wheels will be converted into two-wheeled large spinning wheels. The small textile factory is now working intensely.
