　　On the Growth of American Militarism
　　By Major General M. Galaktionov, translated by Luo Liang

　　Before World War II, the United States Army included regular troops, the National Guard, and officer reserves. In July 1939, the total number of active-duty troops was only 174,000. Compulsory military service had only been implemented during World War I and was reintroduced in September 1940.

　　In early October 1946, U.S. Secretary of the Army R. Patterson stated at a conference in San Francisco that the U.S. Army would have approximately five million men, including regular and reserve forces; the regular army would have approximately one million men.

　　General Spaatz, commander of the U.S. Army Air Forces, spoke even more bluntly at the American Federation of Labor convention in Chicago on October 8, 1946. He demanded the establishment of a powerful army, especially a powerful air force. He said, "Only the Air Force can defend our country from attacks from the Arctic Ocean."

　　Who is planning to attack through the Arctic? General Spaatz did not make this very clear. However, judging from his speech, he himself seemed ready to attack other countries around the world. He said: The industrial areas of Asia, Europe, and the Americas are all within the range of mutual air strikes. The B-36 bomber can carry many bombs and fly 5,000 miles, and then fly back. From these words, we can understand what General Spaatz meant when he said that "American freedom must be defended by force."

　　General Spaatz's speech, like other similar speeches, is a reflection of the power politics that certain commercial and military authorities are trying to force upon the American people. The world's more discerning people know that power politics and international cooperation policies are mutually exclusive.

　　The politics of strength is harmful to the principles of general peace; no one can deny this. However, the politics of strength is especially harmful to the country that implements this policy itself.

　　Past facts undoubtedly prove to us that it is not democratic countries that resort to military force, but rather other types of regimes. When a country is overly enthusiastic about expanding its military, it is a sign of internal weakness.

　　The policy of expanding territory, conquering colonies, and enslaving weak countries has been practiced by many countries since ancient times. However, militarism that excessively expands the military and subordinates the entire country to this goal, to such an active extent, began with Germany. It was she who initiated a frenzied arms race in Europe. However, Germany was not the strongest country, as the war has already proven to everyone.

　　The situation in Italy was also very obvious. Mussolini had been vowing to cut the Gordian knot and use the sword to resolve international relations disputes. He attempted to do so; however, Italy's extremely inflated militarism far exceeded its actual political and economic resources, and the consequences were truly tragic. The same can be applied to Japan, where militarism also developed to the extreme, accompanied by a sharp deterioration in the political and economic situation.

　　These efforts by aggressors to resolve international problems by force led to the collapse of the evil fascist rule, proving the biblical saying to be true: "Those who live by the sword will die by the sword."

　　The Red Army won several decisive battles in Moscow and Leningrad when the aggressors were still boasting about their superiority in manpower and military equipment. The outcome of the war was not determined by the temporary ebb and flow of power between the warring parties in the initial stage of the war, but by some deeper factors. The formation of the anti-Hitler coalition had a great impact on the course and outcome of the war. This alliance between different countries arose from the commonality of the basic interests of all peace-loving countries threatened by fascist aggression. The military strength of the Hitler coalition was supported by moral strength and economic superiority.

　　Aggressor countries made their economies serve militarism before the war. Peace-loving countries were primarily concerned with peaceful economic development. However, their economies proved to be more resistant to the pressure of war than those of the aggressor countries.

　　Therefore, it can be said that in World War II, the militarist relationship that regarded the military as the main method for resolving international problems suffered a complete and thorough defeat. This is one of the main and most significant lessons of this war.

　　However, this disreputable system is being forced upon the American people today. We say forced, after careful consideration, because militarism is indeed incompatible with all American traditions. Americans who are familiar with their country's history will undoubtedly remember that when the Yankees declared war against the slave-owning Southerners, they were immeasurably weaker than the latter from a military point of view. However, they fought for honest and progressive purposes, and their economy was based on free labor, which was another advantage. For this reason, they were able to build a powerful army during the war and achieve victory. Naturally, the subsequent development of capitalist monopoly inevitably led to imperialist tendencies in American policy. However, first, up to this point, American capital did not intend to build on military strength, but on economic erosion. Secondly, the United States did not need a large military force, because no country on the American continent could compete with her militarily.

　　In both world wars, the Americans who were sent overseas to fight had the mentality of volunteers, and they were temporarily conscripted. Wilson and Roosevelt had to work hard to create a state of compulsory military service, and it was limited to the war period.

　　Soon after the end of World War II, there were demands to abolish conscription. The discussions in the Senate on this issue clearly indicated that the general public was in favor of abolition.

　　Naturally, every country must have an army to defend its own security. However, when the army develops beyond this legitimate requirement, becomes the tail of power politics, a means of bullying other countries, or a weapon of threat and extortion, militarism arises.

　　If we are not speaking deceptively, then there is absolutely no way to explain to the American people why the United States still maintains troops in China and the Philippine Islands, and why the United States is expanding its air force in Europe.

　　According to U.S. Mobilization Director Steelman, the army and navy expenses for this fiscal year will account for 45 percent of the total budget.

　　Army appropriations amounted to $75 billion, and the Navy $65 billion. Another $1.95 billion was allocated in the budget for the establishment of permanent military bases in Alaska, the Mariana Islands, the Philippines, Hawaii, and Okinawa. The problem is not the amount of money allocated for the establishment of military bases—this does not include the cost of maintaining existing bases—but the policy hidden behind these measures.

　　No one dares to say that these bases are defensive in nature: they are too far from the American mainland. The establishment of bases near the coast of East Asia fully exposes the ambition of the U.S. Air Force to dominate East Asia. If we add the network of bases near the west coast of Europe and South America, the problem becomes even clearer.

　　The reactionary newspapers in the United States are constantly promoting a set of frightening stories about the United States being vulnerable to air strikes, especially from the Arctic Ocean. The purpose of confusing people is simply to make the American people believe that the current military measures are correct, thereby concealing the intention of aggression.

　　The United States is now pursuing a policy of establishing bases and reorganizing its military, and this policy has already been implemented. The intention is to give the Air Force the most important position. They are preparing to subordinate the Air Force to another independent guidance system. The Air Force will be divided into strategic, tactical, continental (air defense) forces, and transportation flight departments. In a regular army of one million people, the Air Force accounts for as many as 400,000 people, and the ground forces only have 300,000 people, which is a very noteworthy fact.

　　The policy of overseas bases must be supported by a strong navy. Everyone knows how much progress the U.S. Navy has made during the war, how much attention they paid to strengthening the naval air force, building aircraft carriers, and strengthening the anti-aircraft equipment of battleships.

　　Previously, the purpose of the U.S. Navy was only to defend its coast. The Navy operated independently. The new trend in American policy has changed this situation. The main focus is now on the Air Force. They believe that only air superiority can guarantee superiority over the vast ocean. The tendency to attack has risen. The main responsibility of the Navy now is not to defend its own coast, but to protect troop transportation and landing operations. All of this requires a thorough change in the former separateness and independence of the Navy.

　　This explains why the proposal to reorganize the military guidance organization was submitted to Congress. This proposal recommends merging the Army and Navy and establishing a single command. Last June, President Truman sent the same letter to the chairmen of the Army and Navy Affairs Committees of the House of Representatives and Senators. He advocated that the military should be unified and demanded that Congress pass the proposal. However, the result was met with fierce opposition. This opposition was obviously not entirely due to conflicts of interest between departments; it clearly reflected everyone's fear that such measures would further drag the United States onto the path of militarism.

　　The policy of expanding armaments, establishing new bases, and other offensive policies, and the attempt to make the Air Force the most prominent, are all interconnected in a chain. Another link is the atomic bomb. Because air superiority is inevitably related to this new weapon. The results of bombing Germany did not confirm the claim that the Air Force is superior to other weapons. The invention of the atomic bomb has rekindled the hopes of the warlords, and there has been a lot of noise in an attempt to make simple-minded people believe that the bomb can stop militarism. After the invention of the atomic bomb, it is unnecessary to maintain a costly army and navy.

　　There is nothing new in this. Before the war, some people in England advocated that tank warfare was the cheapest method of warfare, and that tanks should be the main and only weapon. Facts have now fully proved the absurdity of this theory. The current atomic policy has only strengthened American militarism and promoted a new arms race. The only fundamental way that countries can take is to completely ban the use of atomic energy for military purposes. This, we know, is precisely the gist of the proposal put forward by the Soviet Union at the United Nations General Assembly.

　　In short, the warlords are trying to prove that their plan is not as expensive as many previous plans: all that is needed are bases, airplanes, and atomic bombs—nothing else. However, it is just a dream to build a power politics on air superiority. No weapon can force democratic countries to succumb to aggressors, and neither can the air force. World War II has shown this with unparalleled clarity.

　　As for the atomic bomb, the mystery of its "supreme divine power" is just a deliberate fabrication to scare the faint-hearted. Even the Bikini Island test, which was part of the atomic diplomacy battle, proved its falsehood, which is very noteworthy. According to a report by the Associated Press correspondent in Washington, D.C., Major General McAuliffe, deputy commander of the joint forces commanding the Bikini Island test, told reporters that using atomic bombs against the army was not very effective. He said that according to the tests of the army's ground equipment, trenches can fully protect soldiers from the damage caused by explosions and heat waves, even if they are very close to the atomic bomb explosion site. Tanks, artillery, and other heavy weapons were not damaged at all near the explosion site.

　　The evaluation made by this highly critical expert on the military nature of the atomic bomb is very important. This further proves that although the atomic bomb has great destructive power when used to bomb peaceful cities, it can never determine the outcome of a war. It cannot make war a quick and cheap deal, as the current war-mongers are deceiving.

　　Naturally, in practice, the warlords' plans are by no means limited to increasing the strength of the air force and atomic bomb weapons; they also actively expand all other weapons and consider launching another protracted and destructive world war. Needless to say, this plan will awaken the American people's consciousness and unite to resist it. They know that half of the country's budget has already been spent on military purposes.

　　A group of guys who advocate power politics in international relations are forcing the United States onto the path of militarism; history tells us that this is a dangerous path of destruction. All countries demand peace and security, but militarism can bring us neither.

　　论美国军国主义的成长
    Ｍ·迦拉克季昂诺夫少将作  罗凉译
    第二次世界大战以前，美国陆军包括有正规军、保安队和军官后备队，一九三九年七月，现役军的总数只有十七万四千人，仅在第一次世界大战中实施过强迫军役，在一九四○年九月又重新实施起来。
    一九四六年十月初旬，美陆军长Ｒ·柏德森在旧金山某次大会上声称，美国陆军将大约有五百万人，正规军和预备军都包括在内；正规军将有大约一百万人。
    美国陆军航空部队司令史巴兹将军，在一九四六年十月八日于芝加哥举行的美国劳工联合会大会上说得更露骨了，他要求建立强大的陆军，特别是强大的空军。他说：“只有空军才能保卫我国不遭受北冰洋方面来的袭击”。
    谁打算经过北极来攻击，史巴兹将军这一点说得不大清楚。可是从他的发言看来，他自己倒是准备攻击其他世界各国的。他说道：亚洲、欧洲和美洲的工业地区都在互相空袭的射程以内，Ｂ三十六型轰炸机可以载很多炸弹飞行五千英里，再飞回来。从这些话看来，史巴兹将军所谓“美国的自由必须用武力来保卫”，我们可以明白这句话用意何在了。
    史巴兹将军的发言，正象其他类似的发言一样，是某些商业和军事权威方面硬要强迫美国人民接受的一种权力政治的反映。世界上一般比较有远见的人们，都知道权力政治和国际合作政策是背道而驰的。
    强权政治是危害一般和平的原则的；谁都不能否认这一点。可是，强权政治尤其要危害推行这种政策的国家自身。
    过去的事实无疑地证明给我们看，诉诸军力的，不是民治国家，而正是别一种统治的国家。当一个国家过分热心于扩充军队，这就是她内部荏弱的表征。
    扩张领土、征服殖民地和奴役弱小国家的政策，自古以来，许多国家就实行着了。可是，过分地扩充军队，把整个国家隶属于这目标之下，表现到这样积极程度的军国主义，却还是以德国为始。是她在欧洲发动了疯狂一样的军备竞赛。然而，德国并不是最强的国家，这次战争早已把事实证明给大家看了。
    意大利的情形，表现得也很明显。墨索里尼一直在誓约着，要快刀斩乱麻，用宝剑来解决国际关系的纠纷。他企图这样做；可是，意大利的极度膨胀了的军国主义远远地超过了她实际的政治和经济资源，他的后果实在是很悲惨的。同样的话也可以适用于日本，军国主义在那边也发展到了极限，随伴而来的却是政治和经济状况的急剧恶化。
    侵略者用武力解决国际问题的这些努力，引向了罪恶法西斯统治的崩溃，证明《圣经》上的名言是不错的：“拿剑的人，将在剑下自毙”。
    莫斯科和列宁格勒几次决定性的大战，是红军在侵略者还自夸着人力和军备优势的时候打胜的。战争的结果，不是被战争初期阶段作战双方暂时的势力消长关系所决定，而是被一些更深入的因素所决定。反希特勒联合阵线的组成，对于战争的过程和结果都有着很大的影响。这不同国家间的联合，是由于一切受到法西斯侵略威胁的爱好和平国家的基本利益的共同性而起。仅希特勒联合阵线的军事力量，由道义的力量和经济的优越支持着。
    侵略国在战前就使经济为军国主义而服务。爱好和平的国家，重要的是关心着和平的经济发展。可是，他们的经济却证明比侵略国更经得起战争的压力。
    因此，可以说，在第二次世界大战中，把军队视为解决国际问题的主要方法的军国主义关系，是遭受到了完全彻底的败北。这是这次战争主要的和最显著的教训之一。
    然而，这种不名誉的体系，今天是在强迫美国人民接受了。我们说强迫，是经过了郑重思考的，因为军国主义的确和一切美国人的传统不合。熟知自己国家的历史的美国人，无疑会记得，当北方佬宣战去反对奴隶所有者的南方人的时候，从军事的观点看来，他们比后者是弱得不可计量的。可是，他们是为了正直和进步的目的而战，而且，他们的经济是基于自由劳动的，这是另一层有利的地方。因为这原因，他们才能在战争的过程中建立一支强大的军队，获得了胜利。自然，资本主义独占制的后来发展，在美国政策中不可避免地引起了帝国主义的倾向。可是，第一，到此时为止，美国资本不打算建筑在军事上，而是要建筑在经济侵蚀作用上。其次，美国不需要很大的军力，因为在美洲大陆上，没有一个国家能在军事上和她分庭抗礼，争个高下。
    在两次大战中，派到海外去作战的美国人，都带着志愿兵的心理，他们是临时被征调去的。威尔逊和罗斯福都费过很大的劲，好容易才造成了强迫军役的状态，而且只限于战争期内如此。
    第二次世界大战中结束后不久，大家就要求废止征兵制度。参议院中关于这一问题的讨论，很清楚的指出，一般民众是赞成废止的。
    自然，每一个国家都须有军队来保卫她自身的安全。可是，当军队发展到超过了这种合法的要求，成了强权政治的尾巴，成了欺凌别国的手段，或者成了威胁勒索的武器的时候，军国主义就产生了。
    如果不作欺人之谈，那就绝对无法向美国人民解释，美国为什么还要在中国和菲律滨维持驻军，美国为什么要在欧洲扩充空军。
    据美国动员局长史蒂曼说，本年会计年度的陆海军费用将占总预算的百分之四十五。
    陆军拨款达七十五万万美金，海军达六十五万万元。预算账内另拨一万万九千五百万元，借作阿拉斯加、马利亚那群岛、菲律滨、夏威夷和冲绳岛等地建立永久军事基地之用。问题不在建立军事基地的拨款之多——这还不包括维持现有基地的费用在内——而在乎隐藏在这些措施后的那个政策。
    没有人敢说这些基地是属于防御性质的：它们离开美国本土太远了。在东亚洲沿岸附近建立基地，这十足暴露了美国空军要在东亚称霸的雄心。如果再加欧洲西岸和南美洲附近的基地网，问题就格外明白了。
    美国的反动报纸，老是宣传着美国容易遭受空袭，特别是来自北冰洋的空袭云云一套吓人的故事。搅惑人心的目的，不过是要叫美国人民相信，现在的军事措置是对的，借此掩饰了进攻的用意。
    美国现在推行着建立基地和改组军队的政策，这政策早已付诸实施了。其用意所在，是要使空军占有最大的地位。他们预备使空军隶属于另一个独立的指导系统之下，空军将被划分为战略、策略、大陆（空防）部队及运输飞行各部门。在一百万人的正规军里面，空军竟达四十万人之多，地上部队只有三十万人，这是一件很值得注意的事。
    远洋基地的政策必须有强大的海军来支持。美国海军在战争期内获得了多大的进步，他们是多么注意加强海军航空部队，建筑航空母舰，加强战舰的防空设备，这是大家都知道的。
    以前，美国海军的目的只在保卫她的海岸。海军是独立作战的。美国政策的新潮流把这情形改变了。主要的重心现在放在空军上面，他们觉得，只有空中的优势才能保证辽阔海洋上的优势。进攻的倾向抬头了，现在海军的主要责任，不是保卫自己的海岸，而是要保护军队运输和登陆行动。这一切，需把以前海军的分离性和独立性加以彻底的改变。
    这解释了改组军队指导机构的提案为什么要在国会中提出来。这项提案建议合并陆海军，建立一个单一的统帅部。去年六月，杜鲁门总统向下院和参议员的陆海军事务委员会主席发出同样的信函，他主张军队应该统一指挥，要求国会把这一提案予以通过。可是，结果遭受到了剧烈的反对。这反对，显然不是完全因各部门利害冲突而起；而是很清楚地反映了大家的恐惧，害怕这种措置会更把美国拖上军国主义的道路。
    扩张军备，建立新基地等等进攻性的政策，使空军占最显著地位的企图，这一切都互相关联在一个连锁中。另外一个环节是原子炸弹。因为空军优势是必然和这新武器有关的。轰炸德国的结果，并没有证实空军比别的武器更优越的说法。原子弹的发明又燃起了军阀们的希望，一时喧声大作，企图使头脑简单的人民相信，炸弹可以让军国主义停止，原子弹发明以后，可以用不着维持消耗颇大的陆海军了。
    这种话没什么新鲜，战前在英国，曾经有人主张，坦克战法是价钱最便宜的战法，坦克应当是主要而唯一的武器。事实现在完全证明这种理论的荒谬了。目前的原子政策只有加强了美国的军国主义，促成了新的军备竞赛。各国可能采取唯一根本的办法，只有完全禁止原子能作为军用。这一点，我们知道，正是苏联在联合国大会上提出的建议的本旨。
    总之，军阀们企图证明他们的计划不象以前的许多计划，价钱非常便宜：需要只是基地、飞机和原子弹——此外就什么都不要了，可是，要在空中优势上建立起强权政治来，这只是痴人说梦而已。没有一种武器可以强迫民主主义国家向侵略者屈膝，空军也不行，第二次世界大战已经把这一点显示得无比的清楚了。
    至于原子弹，它“至高无尚的神力”之谜，不过是故意虚构出来，吓吓神经脆弱的人的。连作为原子外交战的一部分的比基尼岛试验，都证明了它的虚妄，这是非常值得注意的。据联合社驻美京特派员的报告，指挥比基尼岛试验的联合部队副司令麦克奥利夫少将在对记者谈话时表示过，用原子弹来对付军队，是不大有作用的。他说，根据陆军地上设备的试验，堑壕可以十足保护士兵不受到爆炸及热浪袭击的损害，即使很靠近原子弹爆炸的地方也不大要紧。坦克、大炮和别的重武器，在爆炸地点的附近，都一点不会受到损害。
    这位有充分批评能力的专家对于原子弹军事性质所作的评价，是非常值得重视的。这更证明了原子弹用来轰炸和平的城市，虽然有着极大的破坏力，却绝对无法决定战争的成果。它更不能使战争成为迅速而便宜的买卖，如目前的战争贩子所欺骗的。
    自然，在实际上，军阀们的计划决不限于增加空军力量和原子弹武器；他们还要积极地扩充一切别的武器，考虑发动另一次旷日持久的破坏性的世界大战。不用说，这种计划会惊醒了美国人民的自觉，一致起来反抗，他们知道国家的预算一半早已花费到军事用途上去了。
    国际关系中主张权力政治的一批家伙，正在迫使美国走上军国主义的道路；历史昭示我们，这是一条危险的毁灭的道路。各国都要求和平安全，军国主义却两者都不能给我们带来。
