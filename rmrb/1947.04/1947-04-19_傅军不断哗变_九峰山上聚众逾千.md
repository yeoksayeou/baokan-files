Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 17th: Mutiny incidents are constantly occurring within Fu Zuoyi's army. By the end of last year, over a thousand mutinied armed soldiers and escaped conscripts had gathered on Jiufeng Mountain, north of Salachi in western Suiyuan. The leader, Yun Zhan Kui, is from Sa County. Fu Zuoyi's army in Gui Sui once sent a regiment to suppress them, but was defeated with heavy losses. Last October, over forty soldiers from the 17th Temporary Training Division of Fu Zuoyi's army stationed in Jining, led by Squad Leader Dong Cheng, mutinied and took four machine guns and twenty rifles to Jiufeng Mountain. At the same time, over seventy conscripts seized weapons from the Kuomintang militia of the 7th District of Sa County, who were forcibly drafting men in the countryside, and also fled to Jiufeng Mountain. A platoon of the 301st Regiment of the 101st Division of Fu Zuoyi's army, originally stationed in Yaojiafangzi, south of Zhangjiakou in Chahar Province, also mutinied before the Lunar New Year. When the 4th Cavalry Division participated in the invasion of the Yanbei liberated area, the entire 2nd Company of new recruits from its 11th Regiment mutinied in early March. Last month, Fu De Gao and fourteen others from Ma Zhanshan's 5th Cavalry Brigade (formerly a division) under Fu Zuoyi's command, stationed in Yangyuan, southern Chahar, mutinied, taking one machine gun and over ten rifles, and escaped after opening the city gate. They fought with Fu Zuoyi's pursuing troops and have now reached the Sui Meng liberated area. According to the mutinying soldiers, they were all forcibly conscripted, deeply resent the civil war, and could no longer endure the unreasonable oppression and deprivation by the fascist warlord Fu Zuoyi.

Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 17th: After Fu Zuoyi's plan to conscript 100,000 men was thwarted by the resistance of the people of Suiyuan, he has recently resumed large-scale conscription in Suiyuan. Gui Sui closed its city gates for a week to seize conscripts, even grabbing the hospital doctor, Ma Gui Sheng, and the old cook, Ma Wu. Shops were closed, and everyone lived in terror. Foreign merchants in the city, returning home via the Yanbei liberated area, were seen in an endless stream. In a certain district of Youyu alone, 1,500 households were counted. In Baotou, over 800 people were seized in three days. In various places in the back of the set, even old men with white hair were seized. In Yong Sheng Township, Linhe, over 500 people had already been conscripted by the end of last year from just over 400 households. This time, old farmers like Zhao Si Mao, nearly fifty years old, were also seized. When the masses rose up to demand their release, Fu Zuoyi's army opened fire, killing four and wounding seven or eight.

    【新华社晋绥十七日电】傅军不断发生哗变事件，绥西萨拉齐北之九峰山，到去年年底已聚集哗变武装及逃亡壮丁千余人。领导人云占奎，系萨县人。归绥傅军曾派兵一团前往搜剿，被击败损失奇重。去年十月驻集宁之傅军暂十七补训师，一次哗变四十余人，带机枪四挺，步枪二十支，由班长董成率领上了九峰山。同时傅顽萨县七区民团下乡抓丁七十余人，途中壮丁将民团缴枪亦逃上九峰山。原驻察省张家口以南姚家房子傅军一○一师三○一团，于阳历年前亦哗变一班。骑四师此次参加进犯雁北解放区，其十一团新兵二连于三月初全部哗变，上月驻察南阳原之马占山部骑五旅（原师）傅德高等十四人哗变，带机枪一挺，步枪十余支，打开城门逃出，与傅军追击部队战斗，现已到达绥蒙解放区。据哗变士兵称：他们都是被强抓去之壮丁，深恶内战，更不堪傅作义法西斯军阀无理压迫与不得温饱之苦。
