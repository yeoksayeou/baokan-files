Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th -- Shanghai newspapers report: The Chiang government's heavy taxation, requisition, and apportionment have made it impossible for the people to survive. In Yangzhong County, located in the middle of the Yangtze River, in addition to bearing the burden of in-kind taxes, requisitioning, and slaughter business taxes, people also have to pay for firearms, steamship docks, and "Party Affairs Funds." Those who fail to pay are labeled as "hostile elements." In the suburbs of Suzhou, eight or nine out of ten farmers have no surplus grain left. Because they could not bear the burden, the farmers twice surrounded the Wu County Rent Collection Office and destroyed all the account books. In Henan, people are constantly abandoning their homes and fleeing due to the heavy burden. Those who flee often post the title deeds of their fields on their doors as a sign of protest. The people of various counties in the province have already borne more than 20 billion yuan in military expenses. In the famous "Jiangxi granary," the people of Le'an, Wannian, and Dexing counties on the eastern shore of Poyang Lake have been completely drained by village granary grain storage, county granary grain storage, district office rice, township bao rice, requisitioning, and in-kind taxes. Wherever the "grain sweeping teams" go, there is nothing but weeping and wailing. Grain is seized, and even chickens and dogs are disturbed. In addition to urging the delivery of grain, the "grain sweeping teams" also extort money, with one township alone demanding more than one million yuan in straw sandals fees. The people are suffering from this catastrophe. Those with land sell it or simply let it lie barren, while those without land often become "bandits."

　　蒋政府无厌搜刮
    人民多弃家而逃
    【新华社陕北二十六日电】沪报讯：蒋政府征实征借摊派之苛重，已使民族堪命。位于长江中的杨中县人民，除负担征实征借及屠宰营业税外，更有枪械、汽船码头、“党务基金”等捐，不出者即指为“敌对分子”。苏州城郊农民，十分之八、九已家无余粮。该地农民因不胜负担，曾两度包围吴县收租总处，将账册悉依毁去。河南人民因负担苛重，弃家逃遁者屡见不鲜。逃亡者常将其田产契约贴于门上，以示抗议。该省各县人民负担军费已达二百亿元以上。鄱阳湖东岸有名的“江西谷仓”乐（平）、万（年）、德（兴）等县人民已为乡仓积谷、县仓积谷、区公所米、乡保米、征借征实等搜刮殆尽，“扫米队”所到之处，一片＠喝，粮食遭遇拘押，鸡犬为之不宁。“扫粮队”除催粮外，更横加勒索，仅某乡所索取草鞋费即达百万元以上。人民遭此浩劫，有田者卖田卖地，或索性任其荒芜，无田无地者多落荒为“匪”。
