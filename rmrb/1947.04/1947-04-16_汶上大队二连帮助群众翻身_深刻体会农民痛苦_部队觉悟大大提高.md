　　[Report from our Jilu Yu office on the 14th] Last autumn, when our army withdrew from Jining, Chiang's special agents took the opportunity to operate, and the masses wanted to turn over, but some were afraid. The Second Company of the Wenshang Brigade arrived in the Second District at this time to mobilize the masses and insisted on fighting on the periphery. The commanders and fighters all realized that without the help of the masses, they would become blind and deaf, and guerrilla warfare would be difficult to win. But how to mobilize the masses? They adopted the method of pouring out their bitterness first, and launched a campaign to speak out about their sufferings in the team. Dong Guiting, a warrior in the machine gun class, used to have no land at home, and his entire family fled famine; he himself worked for others when he was fourteen years old. When he talked about hitting a big hole when he couldn't shake the well bar, tears poured down; other warriors also remembered the pain of begging for food and being unable to stand up straight in the past. When the movement to speak out about sufferings reached its climax, it turned to talking about the happy life situation after the improvement of the family life now; everyone said: "We have all turned over, but the poor people here are still suffering like we did in the past. There are many special agents, and there are few people in the joint association. We have to help them turn over." They started by helping Xu Village. They did morning exercises in the morning, took classes in the morning, and immediately divided into streets to work for the masses after lunch. They reported in the evening, reviewed the work performance registration, and praised them during daily roll calls. Competitions were launched between classes, and life was very pleasant and tense. Later, the troops moved from Xu Village to Li Yin. Here, they relied on Jiang's occupied areas in the east and Nanwang in the west, and there were quite a few lake bandits and special agents. The Second Company openly supported the masses and went deep into mobilization. Every afternoon, the entire company went out to help the people weed, build houses, push mills, and collect manure. They did everything, which closely connected the troops and the masses and dispelled the masses' concerns. A peasant association of twenty-eight people was formed in a few days. Subsequently, farmer memberships were developed in Chengcun Temple, East and West Shangzhuang, and Shi Village. After the solar new year, a warm land-to-the-peasants movement was launched in the Li Yin area. In one month, 3,000 farmers gained land and food. During the land reform movement, the class consciousness of all the commanders and fighters of the Second Company was greatly improved, and their feelings changed significantly. Dong Guiting, a model worker among the masses, said: "In the past, I always wanted to live in the landlord's house because it was convenient to borrow things. Now, as soon as I see the landlord, I think of their crimes and hate them; when I see the poor, I think of my parents and feel extra kind." Before mobilizing the masses, the Second Company sometimes violated mass discipline, but since mobilizing the masses for several months, it has disappeared. Now they only hate doing less for the masses.
　　At dawn on the twenty-second day of the twelfth lunar month, four enemy columns who came out of Yanzhou to seize grain arrived at Huangjiadian. The Second Company stationed in Li Yin was doing exercises. The soldiers said: "Stop exercising, don't eat, let's go fight!" The team set off, and the people of Li Yin were in an uproar. Men, women, old and young, climbed onto the surrounding areas to watch. The village's militia also formed a transportation team to help. The enemy was repelled, and when the team entered Huangjiadian, familiar old men and women cried to them: "The grain you distributed to us yesterday was taken away by those bastards." The soldiers were furious when they saw this scene. They chased them for twelve miles, killing and wounding seven enemies and intercepting more than twenty carts of grain. When the team returned, the people of Li Yin greeted them at the east gate, preparing steamed buns and soup. Their backpacks placed in Huangjiadian had long been carried back by dozens of children.

　　汶上大队二连帮助群众翻身
    深刻体会农民痛苦
    部队觉悟大大提高
    【本报冀鲁豫十四日电】去秋我军撤出济宁，蒋特趁机活动，群众想翻身，但有些恐惧。汶上大队二连就在这时到二区发动群众，坚持边沿斗争。指战员们都认识没有群众帮忙，就成了瞎子、聋子，游击战争即难获得胜利。但怎样发动群众呢？他们采取了自己先倒苦水的办法，在队中展开诉苦运动。机枪班战士董贵廷，从前家无寸地，全家老小逃荒在外，自己十四岁即给人家做活，当他谈到摇不动辘辘把头撞了个大窟窿时，泪如泉涌；别的战士也想起过去要饭饿得直不起腰的痛苦情景。诉苦运动达到高潮，即转入谈现在家中生活改善后的幸福生活情形；大家都说：“咱们都翻身了，可是这里的穷爷们还和咱们过去一样受苦，特务多，联合会人少，咱们得帮助他们翻身。”先帮助徐村开始，他们早晨出操，上午上课，吃过午饭马上分到各街给群众干活，晚上汇报，检讨登记工作成绩，每日点名时进行表扬，各班之间并掀起竞赛，生活非常愉快紧张。后部队由徐村移至李尹，这里东靠蒋占区，西靠南旺，湖匪特务相当多，二连公开为群众撑腰，并深入启发动员，每天下午全体出动，帮助老百姓锄草、盖房、推磨、拾粪，什么活都做，密切了部队与群众的关系，解除了群众的顾虑，几天即组成二十八人的农会。接着在城村寺、东西尚庄、石村等村都发展了农会员。阳历年后，李尹一带即掀起热烈的土地还家运动，一个月即有三千农民得到土地和粮食。在土地改革运动中，二连全体指战员的阶级觉悟大为提高，感情上都起了显著变化。群工模范董贵廷说：“过去老愿住地主家，认为借东西方便，现在一看见地主，就想到他们的罪恶，就仇恨；看到穷人就想起自己的爹娘，分外亲热。”发动群众前，二连有时违犯群众纪律，但自发动群众数月以来，已经绝迹。现在他们只嫌给群众办的事少。
    腊月二十二从兖州出来抢粮的敌人四路纵队一清早就到了黄家店，驻在李尹的二连正在出操，战士说：“不操了，别吃饭了，去打吧！”队伍出发了，李尹的老百姓轰动起来，男女老幼都爬到围子上去看。村里的自卫队也组成交通组去帮助，敌人被击退，队伍进至黄家店时，熟识的老大爷和妇女哭着向他们诉苦：“你们昨天分给我们的粮食，被那些龟孙抢走了。”战士们看到这番景象，怒火冲天，他们又一直追击了十二里地，毙伤敌人七名，截下粮食二十多车。队伍回来时，李尹的老百姓迎出东门，准备好馒头和汤水。他们放在黄家店的背包，早被几十个儿童背回来了。
