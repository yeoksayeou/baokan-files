    Establish Model Banners
    Promote Cadre Strengths
    The Eighth Prefectural Committee of Ji-Lu-Yu Calls for Launching the Li Shouchang Movement
    [Report from this newspaper, Ji-Lu-Yu, 20th] In the model emulation and merit-making movement, Li Shouchang, the deputy director of the United Association of the First District of Guancheng, has become a model in various tasks. The Eighth Prefectural Committee has called on the entire district to launch the Li Shouchang movement. First, Li Shouchang is a banner in various tasks. He comes from a poor family and has suffered various oppressions and exploitations from feudal forces. He deeply understands the small interests of the peasants. Several years ago, he led the production cooperation in Houshangu and other villages, promoted the production movement in the entire Guancheng, and was elected as a labor hero of the entire district. He is already fifty years old, but in this patriotic self-defense war, he proposed: to carry stretchers eighteen times. Every time he carried a stretcher, he vied to go, no matter how dangerous it was. He often said: It is an honor to sacrifice for the people. While carrying stretchers, he was very concerned about the lives and illnesses of the stretcher bearers. The stretcher bearers all said: Li Shouchang treats us better than his own brothers. The stretchers he carried never ran away, and each time he completed the task. Therefore, Li Shouchang has become a hero in war support and has received a commendation from the headquarters. In the recent land-to-the-tiller movement, he has been working day and night to make contributions to the people. At the county-wide activist meeting, after he announced his plan to make contributions, everyone was moved to tears. Second, he implemented the mass line in his work. He often said: More people have more ideas, and things should be discussed with everyone. Therefore, he is very patient and democratic. He believes in the opinions of the majority and has never poured cold water on the masses. Third, Li Shouchang's class standpoint is very firm. In leading the masses in struggle, no matter how good the landlords' words sound, it is not enough without taking out things. Conversely, his attitude towards the masses is particularly kind. Fourth, Li Shouchang has a tenacious spirit to overcome difficulties. He said: There is no suffering that cannot be endured, and no difficulty that cannot be overcome. Although he is illiterate, he can still regularly write articles for newspapers. Now the Eighth Prefectural Committee calls on the entire Party to learn from the people's meritorious servant Li Shouchang and widely launch the Li Shouchang movement. First, this movement should be built on the foundation of the class consciousness of serving the people, calling on cadres to reflect on themselves and examine how many good things they have done for the people in various tasks, in order to improve their class consciousness. Second, the Li Shouchang movement should become a standard for us to review and promote cadres. Whoever makes more contributions to the people is a good cadre, and we should boldly promote him. Third, in terms of leadership methods, on the one hand, we should implement ideological education on serving the people, and at the same time, establish merit-recording and merit-evaluating committees at the county level to regularly distinguish between good and bad and give praise and criticism.

    发扬干部优点
    冀鲁豫八地委号召开展李守诚运动
    【本报冀鲁豫二十日电】在表模立功运动中，观城一区联合会副主任李守诚成为各种工作的模范，八地委号召全区开展李守诚运动。第一、李守诚是各种工作中的旗帜。他是穷家出身，曾受过封建势力的种种压迫与剥削，他对农民细小的利益体会很深，在几年前，他领导了后山谷等村的生产合作，推动了全观城的生产运动，被选为全区的劳动英雄。他已五十岁了，但在这次爱国自卫战争中，又提出：要带十八次担架，每次带担架他都争着去，不管有多大的危险他都不怕，他经常说：为人民牺牲是光荣的。在带担架中很关心担架夫的生活与疾病，担架夫都说：李守诚对咱比亲兄弟还好。他带的担架都不跑，每次都完成了任务，因此李守诚又成为战勤中的英雄，曾得到指挥部的通令嘉奖。在最近的土地还家运动中，他又昼夜不休的为人民立功，他在全县活动分子会上，宣布了自己立功计划后，大家都感动的流出泪来。第二、在工作中贯彻了群众路线。他常说：人多办法多，办事要大家商量着来，因此他很耐心、很民主，他相信大多数的意见，向来没给群众泼过冷水。第三、李守诚的阶级立场很稳，他在领导群众斗争中，不管地主说得多好听，不拿出东西来是不行的。反之，对群众的态度则特别和蔼。第四、李守诚具有克服困难的顽强精神，他说：没有吃不了的苦，没有克服不了的困难，他虽不识字，仍能经常给报纸写稿。现八地委号召全党向人民功臣李守诚学习，普遍开展李守诚运动。第一、要把这一运动，建筑在为人民服务的阶级觉悟的基础上，号召干部反省自己，检查自己在各种工作中，究竟给人民办了多少好事，以便提高自己的阶级觉悟。第二、李守诚运动应成为我们审查干部提拔干部的一个标准。谁给人民立功多，谁就是好干部，就大胆的提拔他。第三、在领导方法上，一方面贯彻为人民服务的思想教育，同时以县为单位，成立记功评功委员会，经常甄别好坏，给以表扬与批评。
