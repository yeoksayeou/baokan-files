    Eliminating Ideological Obstacles Doubles Production Enthusiasm
    Many Villages in Licheng Complete Wheat Hoeing
    [This newspaper, Licheng] Following the Licheng mass production mobilization, the masses have shown great enthusiasm for production. Various villages, in conjunction with rectifying mutual aid teams and led by heroes, are actively hoeing wheat. Wang Haiyun's group in Zhangjiashan will have completely hoed 632 mu of wheat by the 14th; Yuan Village, under the guidance of the Technical Committee, hoed 120 mu of wheat in two days (with 25 laborers), and pointed out the two wheat hoeing methods of shallow hoeing and short pulling. Zhao Peng's labor hero group in Lizhuang not only hoed all 151 mu of wheat, but also milked all 28 mu of wheat that had been converted to stubble. This year, the masses are very active in hoeing wheat. Houxiayu Village completely hoed all 777 mu of wheat in the village in three days; Shangcun Village hoed 226 mu of wheat in two days. (Yang Ke)
    [This newspaper] Zhangjing Village, in the first district of Pingshun, began hoeing wheat on the 13th. In three days, 130 laborers in the village completely hoed 400 mu of wheat. The method was to first mobilize Guo Qilu's group and connect with the Linxian people in his group, saying that hoeing wheat is good, the stalks are strong, resist the wind, and each dou of flour can produce half a jin more; the locals said that they had never hoed in previous years, and didn't it grow the same? After discussion, they understood, and went to hoe wheat the next day. A group leader meeting was held again at night to mobilize wheat hoeing. Some people said that it was the same without hoeing in previous years, and besides, this year's labor force is short, so they can't catch up. Based on this situation, everyone was asked to discuss. Zhihai said: "It's better to hoe. Last year, I hoed one mu of wheat and harvested seven dou, which is two dou more than in previous years." Qilu said: "My group has five laborers and 15 mu of wheat land, which can be hoeed in three days." After this kind of coaxing, everyone understood, and they all went to hoe wheat the next morning.

    扫除思想障碍生产热情倍增
    黎城不少村完成锄麦
    【本报黎城讯】黎城大生产动员后，群众生产热情很高，各村结合整顿互助组，在英雄带领下，积极锄麦。张家山王海云组十四日前即将六百三十二亩麦全部锄完；元村在技术委员会指导下两天内锄麦一百二十亩（二十五个劳力），并指出锄的浅与拉的短的两点锄麦办法。李庄劳动英雄赵蓬组不仅将一百五十一亩麦全部锄完，并将二十八亩改茬麦亦全部奶过。今年群众对锄麦很积极，后狭峪三天即将全村七百七十七亩麦全部锄过；上村两日内锄了二百二十六亩麦。（杨柯）
    【本报讯】平顺一区张井村在十三日开始锄麦子，三天时间全村一百卅个劳力将四百亩麦子全部锄完。作法是先从郭起禄组动员，拉通他这个组里的林县人，说是锄麦好，秆子硬，顶风，每斗面也能多出半斤；本地人都说往年没有锄过，不也是一样长吗，经讨论后，弄通了，第二天就全部锄麦子去了。黑夜又召开组长会议，动员锄麦，有人说往年不锄也一样，再说今年的劳力缺，也赶不过来。根据这种情况，就让大家讨论，芝孩说：“还是锄了好，去年我一亩麦地锄了后就打了七斗，比往年多打二斗。”起禄说：“我组五个劳力，十五亩麦地，三天就能锄完。”经这样圪拉后，大家都弄通了，第二天早晨就都去锄麦了。（平顺春耕小报）
