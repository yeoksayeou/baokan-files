    Heroic Persistence in Repeated Anti-Raiding
    Land Distribution Through Grid System in Xiangling
    [Report from this newspaper, Taiyue, 17th] In the Xiangling grid area, the land reform movement is being widely brewed and launched, with the struggle covering 70 percent of the land. In Anli Village, 177 out of 239 households have been drawn into the struggle. The movement is continuing to expand, aiming to involve 91 percent of the farmers in the struggle. The villagers are in high spirits for the struggle. During the fight against a local tyrant, when the enemy raided neighboring Wu Ping Village more than 300 times, the masses persisted in the struggle. They said, "No need for you to jump around, we are digging at your legs, so you will slowly become immobile!" The masses in the Shangxihe and Pandao districts, hearing about the struggles in other villages, eagerly sought out cadres to lead them in implementing land reform. The reasons for the development of this movement, in addition to the mutual assistance and competition triggered by breakthroughs in six key points, include: (1) Cadres who persisted in the mass movement were determined to share life and death with the masses. In more than ten anti-raiding battles, they always stood with the masses to strike at the enemy, strengthening the masses' fighting spirit. The masses eliminated any thought of a change in regime and were determined to follow the Communist Party to the end. Furthermore, due to the enemy's brutal raids, the masses had suffered greatly from the oppression of the landlords and local bullies. Therefore, when proposing the policy, they combined "land to the tiller" with grievances and revenge, enabling the masses to quickly accept it and take action. (2) From the beginning, the masses launched a military struggle at the front, protecting the mass struggle at the rear. The front and rear mutually promoted and encouraged each other, making the struggle develop faster. (3) The government supported the masses and emboldened them. To prevent the objects of the struggle from escaping, the government issued a notice to the farmers stating that fleeing landlords could still be liquidated according to law. The farmers of Shangliang put forward the slogan, "People may run away, but the pot will not; if they run, they leave behind their crimes; if they don't, they leave behind their lives."
    [Report from this newspaper, Taiyue, 17th] The guerrilla war and the land reform movement are being promoted simultaneously in the border areas of Jiexiu. Xicun and Songyu Villages have already eliminated feudalism and realized "land to the tiller". Shangliang, Zhaojiayao and other seven villages are distributing the fruits of the struggle. In the ten villages where the struggle between the enemy and us is most acute, such as Xia Li Hou, Liugou, Longfeng, Zhangsui, and Da Ge, a fierce struggle is also unfolding amidst the gunfire. Villages such as Zhangyuan, Wencun, Juantou, and Dongguanzhuang on both sides of the railway are all conducting the struggle under the cover of our militia. The armed village governments are the main leading bodies for the guerrilla war and the land reform. The armed village governments of Jia Village, Mabi, and other villages lead the militia in actively attacking the enemy, protecting the land reform in the rear, and achieving great results. According to March statistics, there were a total of 28 battles, large and small, killing, capturing, and wounding 73 enemies, and seizing 2 machine guns, 9 rifles, and many other supplies. The Third District created the "hornet joint defense" tactic: if one village fires a shot, all villages provide reinforcements; if one village is attacked by the enemy, everyone joins in. For example, on March 24, when a police detachment of more than 100 enemies from Shihe broke into our "hornet joint defense formation", they were attacked everywhere while passing through villages such as Hedong and Liangdi. By sunset, they had suffered 18 casualties and fled in a panic.

　　英勇坚持多次反扫荡
    襄陵格子网普遍分田
    【本报太岳十七日电】襄陵格子网内，土地改革运动正普遍酝酿开展中，斗争地面已达到百分之七十。安李村二百三十九户，已有一百七十七户卷入斗争。现正继续扩大，争取百分之九一农民参加斗争。该村斗争情绪很高，在斗争恶霸当中，敌人三百多袭入邻村吴平庄，群众依然坚持斗争。并说：“不用你乱跳，我们正挖你的腿，叫你慢慢地不能动了！”上西和、盘到两小区各村群众听到别村斗争，急得自动来找干部去领导他们实行土地改革。这一运动得以开展的原因，除由六个基点突破引起互助竞赛之外，还有：（一）坚持群运的干部抱定和群众同生死的决心，在十几次的反扫荡战中，始终和群众在一起打击敌人，坚定了群众的斗志。群众消除了变天思想，死也要跟上共产党走。又由于敌人残酷扫荡，群众受尽了豪绅恶霸的欺压，所以在提方针时把“耕者有其田”与诉苦复仇结合起来，使群众能迅速接受，进入行动。（二）群众一开始就展开了前边的军事斗争，保卫了后边的群众斗争。前后互相推动鼓舞，使斗争发展更快。（三）政府给群众撑腰壮胆。为防止斗争对象逃跑，政府曾布告农民，对逃跑地主仍可依法清算。上梁农民提出“跑了人，锅端不跑，”“跑了留罪过，不跑留生活”的口号。
    【本报太岳十七日电】介休边地游击战争与土地改革运动，同时推进。现已有西村、松峪两村消灭封建实现了耕者有其田。上梁、赵家窑等七村正进行分配果实。在敌我斗争最尖锐的下李后、柳沟、龙风、张岁、大革等十村，在炮火连天中也展开激烈斗争。铁路两侧之张愿、温村、娟头、董官庄等村，皆在我民兵武装掩护之下，进行斗争。而武装村公所便是游击战争与土地改革之主要领导机构。贾村、马壁等村武装村公所领导民兵，主动袭击敌人，掩护了后方的土地改革，获得很大成绩。据三月份统计：共大小战斗二十八次，毙俘伤敌七十三人、缴获机枪二挺、步枪九支及其它物资甚多。三区创造了“蚂蜂联防”战术，一村打枪，村村增援，一村有敌大家添拳。如三月二十四日石河敌警察大队百余人撞进我“蚂蜂联防阵”内，途经河东、梁地等村，处处挨打，至日落时伤亡十八人，狼狈而逃。
