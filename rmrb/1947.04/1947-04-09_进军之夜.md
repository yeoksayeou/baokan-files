　　Night of the Advance
    Wu Xiang
    What can be gained by occupying Yan'an? The various battlefields across the country will soon give the traitor Chiang Kai-shek an angry and clear answer.
    General Liu Bocheng's ever-victorious army has advanced by leaps and bounds again. Thousands upon thousands of soldiers, inspired by the great slogan of defending Chairman Mao and defending the Party Central Committee, brave the thick darkness of the night, swiftly and quietly marching forward.
    The wind and sand blowing across the Yellow River often make it difficult to open one's eyes. Upon reaching the encampment, sentries must be posted, and the cooks must boil water and cook, leaving little time for rest. However, for the People's Liberation Army, tempered by years of war, these difficulties are a welcome treat. Their feet can move at any time, and they can reach any place. No Chiang army can stop them from suddenly descending and completely crushing them.
    What is everyone thinking as they march silently? They are thinking, "Make even greater contributions to defend Chairman Mao!" "Defend the farmers' land!"
    The cooks of the 9th Company of a certain regiment put forward the guarantee of "hot rice, hot dishes, and hot soup," and also proposed a competition of "resolutely not falling behind during the march." Carrying oil drums and leading pack animals, they marched alongside everyone, never leaving their side. That solemn oath gives them strength and courage every minute and every second.
    Here are more than a thousand Taiwanese soldiers. More than two months ago, they laid down their weapons with Xie Maoquan, the brigade commander of the 140th Brigade, in the suburbs of Yutai City, and threw themselves into the embrace of the people of the motherland. They have already transformed into conscious people's fighters, accustomed to enduring the wind and sand of the Yellow River, and bravely fighting shoulder to shoulder with the sons of northern China. The news of the armed uprising of the Taiwanese people excited them so much that they jumped up like children, shouting in broken Northern dialect: "Everyone work hard and keep it up to end Chiang Kai-shek's rule!" They are not thinking of hardship, but of tomorrow's victory.
    Along the way, the old men and women of the villages, led their children and held their grandchildren, going out to see this countless and endless people's army before dawn. The night is thick and dark, but their faces seem to have a discernible smile of gratitude and pride. This is their own army, and perhaps their sons and husbands are among them. They are glorious. They wholeheartedly pray for victory.
    Behind the column are the stretchers. I asked one of the teams, and they said they were from Dong'e County, already more than four hundred li from home, but none of them had deserted. What made these farmers become as resolute and tenacious as soldiers in just a few days? What force makes them advance so rapidly and quietly in the middle of the night; and moreover, no one has fallen behind, and no one has lagged?
    We will surely win, not only in battle, but it has already been decided before the battle, during this march. Chiang Kai-shek should understand that the lifespan of his dictatorial rule is only a few days. The People's Liberation Army not only has courage and skill, but also has millions of pairs of feet combined into one pair, that can go anywhere, and can move at any time, great, resolute and tenacious feet.
    Dawn is ahead, welcoming the warriors advancing on the vast plains of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan.

　　进军之夜
    吴象
    侵占延安能得到什么？全国各个战场很快都会给卖国贼蒋介石以愤怒的、明确的答案。
    刘伯承将军的常胜军又大踏步前进了，我们已经走了好几夜。千千万万为保卫毛主席保卫党中央的伟大口号激励的战士，冒着浓黑的夜，迅疾地、肃静地向前挺进。
    黄河边漫天的风沙，常常使人睁不开眼，到达宿营地要放哨警戒，炊事员们要烧水做饭，不能很好休息。但是，对这些困难，对于有着多年的战争锻炼的人民解放军，是甘之如饴的。无时不能走的脚，而他们无处不能到，任何蒋军都不能阻止他们突然踏到，而且把他们彻底踏翻。
    每个人在默默行进时想着什么？他们想着“立更大的功，保卫毛主席！”“保卫农民的土地！”
    某团九连的炊事员提出了“饭热、菜热、汤热”的保证，还提出了“行军坚决不掉队”的竞赛。他们担着油桶、赶着驮子、一步也不离地和大家一起行进。那庄严的宣誓，每分钟每秒钟都给他们以力量和勇气。
    这里是一千多名台湾兵，他们两个多月前在鱼台城郊，随一四○旅旅长谢懋权一起放下武器，投入了祖国人民的怀抱，已经变为觉悟的人民战士，惯于忍受黄河的风沙，豪勇地与北中国的男儿们并肩战斗着。台湾人民武装起义的消息，曾使他们兴奋得同孩子似的跳起来，用生硬的北方话喊叫着：“大家努力加油，结束蒋介石的统治！”他们想的不是艰苦，而是明天的胜利。
    沿途各村的老大爷、老大娘们，天还没有亮就领着孩子，抱着孙子，出门来看这数不清走不完的人民大军。夜是浓黑的，但是他们脸上似乎还有着可以辨认的感激与骄傲的微笑，这是他们自己的军队，也许这里面就有他们的儿子和丈夫。他们是光荣的。他们全心全意祈祷着胜利。
    队伍后边是担架。我问了其中的一队，说是东阿县的，已经离家四百多里了，但是没有一个逃跑的。什么使这些农民几天之中就变成军队一样的坚决与顽强？什么力量使他们深更半夜里还这样急速而静肃地挺进；而且谁也没掉队，谁也没有拉距离？
    我们一定要胜利，不仅在战斗之中，而且在战斗之前、在这行军的时候已经决定了。蒋介石应该明白自己的独裁统治的寿命没有几天了。人民解放军不仅有勇气、有技术，而且有千百万双合成一双的、无处走不到，无时不能走的脚，伟大的坚决顽强的脚。
    黎明在前面迎接着挺进在冀鲁豫大平原上的勇士们。
