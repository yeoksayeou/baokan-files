The Fall of Chiang’s Fortress in Southern Shanxi
    ——A Record of the Battle to Capture Quwo
    Zhang Keren, Lu Sheng

From the day Japan surrendered until the hour before the People's Liberation Army captured the city, Yan Xishan spared no effort in killing over a thousand lives to manage Quwo City as a bloody slaughterhouse. More than 500 people were shot or thrown into dry wells for building the city, some were buried in the fortifications, or died of exhaustion and fatigue.

The city had 945 large and small bunkers, including 198 heavy bunkers and more than 290 hidden bunkers. A parapet wall surrounded the city, and outside the wall was a moat nine li long, two to three zhang wide and deep. Along the walls of the nine passes, there was another moat about thirty li long, and the East Pass even had four moats. In front of each important fortification, there were barbed wire, chevaux-de-frise, minefields, and various ground obstacles. The firepower network was three-dimensional, with towering bunkers above, gun holes in the city walls in the middle, and three layers of bunkers deep in the ground, supplemented by hidden bunkers to cover dead angles. In addition to heavy and hidden bunkers, the East Pass also had two bullseye-style stockades, each with a moat, stockade wall, and four heavy bunkers, capable of holding a company. The stockade closer to the south even had double walls and double stockades. If attacking from the East Pass, one would have to pass through four moats, two city walls, and a parapet wall. Even if the city wall was breached, resistance could still be put up. However, such a fortress was also destroyed by the people's army.

Defend Chairman Mao, we must take Quwo City. This was the unanimous determination of all the officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army. Before the attack, everyone devoted themselves to the intense preparations for capturing the city. Zhang Lilong, an engineer from the 403rd detachment, didn't sleep for two days and nights, his eyes were red as if they were about to bleed, but he still excitedly said, "For Chairman Mao, I can stay up a few more days!" When the soldiers of a certain regiment opened up trenches in front, the regiment political commissar and clerks etc. passed by and helped with the work. The Yangcheng stretcher team also processed and repaired in the rear. This was a great collective creation.

A certain meritorious unit first had to destroy Quwo’s first line of defense – the North Pass on the tenth afternoon. There were dense layers of firepower points here, but when the first artillery shell of our army exploded on a bunker, the second platoon pounced on the bunker like tigers rushing out of their dens, quickly eliminated the obstacles, and approached the wall. Zhang Shixiong, the branch secretary and an excellent grenade thrower, threw grenades one after another, blasting the wall into a wall of fire. The third squad rushed over to set up a springboard, and raised a ladder. Li Jinghai was the first to rush up. The ladder was short and the wall was high, so he couldn't reach it. The squad leader Wang Zhong and Zhang Qiushuo immediately went to push it. The three of them continuously climbed the wall, captured a small bunker, and captured five enemies, pressing the enemy all the way into the northwest corner. The 409th detachment attacked the East Pass. They first attacked the two bullseye-style stockades. Under the firepower of the sharpshooter Zhao Lantu was the first to climb the stockade and captured an enemy. A grenade flew out from the side and wounded him, but he still bravely charged forward and climbed the third wall. In just ten minutes, this pair of bullseyes were dug out. Wu Zhiguo, the enemy regiment commander guarding the East Pass, was forced to lead his troops back into the city.

The formal battle to capture the city began on the afternoon of the fourteenth. Our artillery and machine guns were set up outside the East Gate. The assault team formed, and the engineers were busily working. The North Pass, West Pass, and South Pass were all waiting for the order to attack the city. At this time, a roar sounded, and the East Wall shook a few times. Light and heavy weapons fired together, and Quwo City was completely engulfed in dense artillery fire. Sharpshooter Ma Xikou aimed his artillery at a ridge line of a hidden bunker outside the city, firing three shots in a row that all hit from the ridge line. The grenade throwers threw grenades continuously, burning the East Gate tower red. Mutual aid group leader Yuan Wanming and Ding Si learned to climb the city, occupied a bunker, and commanded their group to advance south, occupying the second bunker. The enemy soldiers were forced to counterattack by their officers with machine gun bayonets, and another group of retreating enemies were beaten back by the police, forming a stalemate on the city wall.

Young Guo Xianglin had traveled through the intense artillery fire three times to replenish ammunition. Shi Riti raised his broadsword, led the soldiers, and rushed towards the north city wall, capturing four bunkers in one breath. Yuan Wanming was knocked off the city by an artillery shell, and climbed back up, Zhao Jun, the hero of killing the enemy, took the lead in charging forward despite the artillery fire, forcing the enemy to retreat again. People's warriors captured one street, and then attacked another, artillery shells chased the enemy through every street.

At the same time, the warriors on the North Gate were also making a fierce breakthrough against the enemy. Li Defa and Niu Sanhai were wounded, but they still rushed up. A soldier in the grenade throwing group had his cotton-padded jacket blown off by a grenade thrown from the city wall, and simply took off his cotton-padded clothes and rushed forward. They finally bravely rushed up the North Gate tower and confronted the enemy on the tower. Another group chased the retreating enemy in depth, and the streets were immediately filled with discarded rotten cotton-padded clothes, broken quilts, intact weapons and ammunition, and lying, moaning enemy wounded.

As the sun radiated golden light, Quwo City was liberated.

　　晋南蒋军要塞的陷落
    ——记曲沃攻城战斗
    张克仁、鲁生
    从日本投降那天起，到人民解放军攻下城的前一点钟止，阎锡山为经营曲沃城这座血腥屠场，曾不惜杀害千余生命。因修城被枪杀或投进枯井的就有五百多人，还有的埋在工事里，或因体力不济，疲劳而死。
    城内大小碉堡九百四十五个，内有重碉一百九十八个，暗碉二百九十多个。绕城一道胸墙，墙外又是一道长九里、宽深各两三丈的外壕。沿着九关的围墙，又是一道长约三十里的外壕，东关甚至有四道外壕。在每个重要工事前面又有铁刺、鹿砦、雷区及地面各种障碍物。火力网为立体设备，上为林立的碉堡，中为城墙上的枪眼，下为地面纵深三层碉堡，又用暗碉补助死角。东关除重碉、暗碉外，另筑两个牛眼式的寨子，每寨有外壕、寨墙和四个重碉，可容一个连。靠南的寨子还是双层围墙、双重寨。假如从东关进攻，就要通过四道外壕，两道城墙，一道胸墙。就是突破城墙，亦仍可负隅抵抗。但是，这样的要塞被人民军队同样摧毁了。

    保卫毛主席，一定要打下曲沃城。这是人民解放军全体将士一致的决心，攻城前所有的人都投入了紧张的攻城准备工作。四零三部工兵张立龙两天两夜没睡觉，眼睛红的象要流出血来，但仍兴奋的说：“为毛主席，再熬几天也行！”某团战士在前面开辟了壕沟，团政委与文书等路过，即帮助加工。阳城担架队也在后方加工修理，这是伟大的集体创作。
    立功部队某部，于十日下午首先要毁灭曲沃的第一道防线——北关。这里有密密层层的火力点，但当我军第一颗炮弹在碉堡上爆炸时，第二排就如猛虎出洞一样扑向碉堡，迅速消除了障碍物，接近了围墙。支部书记张世雄这个出色的投弹手，一颗连一颗的投过炸弹去，把围墙炸成了一堵火墙。三班突过来架起跳板，竖起梯子，李景海第一个抢了上去，梯短墙高，够不着，班长王忠与张秋锁马上去推送。三人连续登上围墙，夺了一个小碉堡，俘掳了五个敌人，一直把敌压到西北角里。攻击东关的是四零九部队。他们首先攻击牛眼式的两个寨子。在神炮手的火力下，赵兰土第一个登寨，俘掳了一个敌人。侧面飞出来一颗炸弹把他打伤了，但他仍奋勇前冲，登上第三道围墙。仅十分钟，就把这一对牛眼挖掉了。守卫东关的敌人团长武芝国被迫率部退回城内。
    正式攻城战斗开始于十四日下午。东城门外架起了我们的大炮和机枪。突击队组成了工兵忙碌的工作着。北关、西关、南关都在等待着攻城的命令。这时一阵轰响，东城墙摇幌了几摇。轻重武器一齐射击，曲沃城完全陷入浓密的炮火声中。神炮手马西寇的炮口，对准一个突击城外的暗碉堡的一条棱线，连发三炮都从棱线上打了进去。投弹手接连的投弹，把东门楼烧得通红。互助组长原万明跟丁四学登上了城，占领了一个碉堡，就指挥自己的小组向南猛进，占领了第二个碉堡。敌人的士兵被他的官长用机枪刺刀逼得反冲过来，另一股退却的敌人被警察打了回来，就在城墙上形成对峙。
    年青的郭向林为着接济弹药，已在激烈的炮火下穿行过三次。石日提起大刀、带着战士、向北城墙冲过去，一口气占了四个碉堡。原万明被炮弹打的跌下城去，又爬上城来，杀敌英雄赵军，冒着炮火带头冲锋，迫使敌人又退了回去。人民勇士夺了一条街，又攻一条街，炮弹穿过每条街道追击着敌人。
    同一时间，北门上的勇士们也在向敌猛突。李德法和牛三孩挂了彩，但仍突了上去。投弹组的一个战士棉衣被城墙上扔下的炸弹炸脱了，率性脱下棉衣，冲向前去。他们终于勇猛冲上北城楼，在城楼上与敌对峙起来。另一股向纵深追击溃退的敌人，街上立即被敌人抛弃的烂棉衣、破被子、完好的武器弹药和躺着哀叫的敌人伤兵塞满了。
    在太阳放射出金光时，曲沃城光复了。
