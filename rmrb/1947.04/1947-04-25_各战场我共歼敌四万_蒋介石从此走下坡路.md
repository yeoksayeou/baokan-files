    On All Battlefields, We Annihilated 40,000 Enemy Troops; Chiang Kai-shek's Decline Begins Hereafter
    This week, good news arrived like snowflakes.
    Less than twenty days after the great victory at Qinghuabian, the Northwest People's Liberation Army, on the 14th, again south of Wayaobao, in a fierce eight-hour battle, decisively annihilated the entire 135th Brigade of Hu Zongnan's army, capturing acting Brigade Commander Mai Zongyu alive. This sliced off a chunk from the long line of Hu Zongnan's troops spread out on the mountains. The reinforcing troops, only five li away, stood there dumbfounded, "observing the battle" from the sidelines. This victory marked a turning point in the Northwest war situation. From then on, Hu Zongnan no longer possessed the arrogance he had on the 19th of last month when he attacked Yan'an with a force of fourteen brigades. He could only gather eight brigades (one of which had already been annihilated) and line them up on barren mountains, wasting bullets at the mountain peaks (according to a captured regimental commander of Chiang's army). The Central News Agency has been dreaming every day: "The National Army annihilated over 10,000 of He Long's main force of the Communist army south of Wayaobao!" Who was actually annihilated? Mai Zongyu will soon come forward to prove it. Hu Zongnan invented a "gap-drilling tactic" of only walking and not fighting, but he forgot that the People's Liberation Army had already spread its nets wide. Wang Shuchen, the Deputy Brigade Commander of the 27th Brigade captured in the Jinan campaign and Hu Zongnan's longtime follower and confidant, said it well: "Hu Zongnan is trapped in the Yan'an mud pit and will either be dismissed, die in battle, or be captured."
    The amazing victories of Liu Bocheng's ever-victorious army of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Military Region in southern Shanxi and northern Henan have completely shifted the initiative of the war into our hands.
    General Chen Geng's mighty army advanced rapidly, and as of the 15th, had successively captured ten cities including Fushan, Yicheng, Qi County, Xinqi, Hejin, Jishan, Wanquan, Ronghe, Quwo, and Yishi, annihilating over 10,000 enemy troops, controlling over 150 li of the southern section of the Tongpu Railway, firmly grasping the important gateway to Qin and Jin, the Yumenkou, and entering the Fen River Delta, the birthplace of the Chinese nation. The important strategic stronghold of Yuncheng is now directly exposed to our army's front lines. The great battle is just beginning, but it has already caused Chiang Kai-shek and Hu Zongnan immense grief. Hu Zongnan's old nest in Shanxi has been destroyed. His rear is under a fatal threat. From Xuchang to Tongguan, except for a division guarding Luoyang, everything else is "empty." What else can Hu Zongnan do besides firing cannons across the river at our army at Yumenkou and Hejin to embolden himself?
    Another powerful army corps of General Liu Bocheng, after sweeping away the Chiang-puppet strongholds in northern Henan and annihilating 9,000 enemy troops, surrounded the reinforcements sent by Chiang Kai-shek to relieve the siege of Tangyin: the 49th Brigade, two brigades of the 66th Division, the 122nd Regiment of the 41st Division, a regiment of the 127th Regiment of the 47th Division, and a regiment of the 40th Division, totaling five brigades, in the area north of Daokou, northeast of Qi County. On the 16th, the counterattack began, first annihilating a fast column of Chiang Kai-shek's troops and capturing the leader (brigade commander) Li Shouzhen alive. By 1:00 PM on the 18th, our army concluded the great battle northeast of Qi County with a major victory of annihilating two brigades of Chiang's army. The People's Liberation Army took advantage of the victory to recover important towns such as Jun County, Hua County, Qi County, and Daokou, annihilating 13,000 enemy troops. On the third day after Chiang's army was annihilated, the Kuomintang propaganda machine desperately screamed: "The National Army has reached outside Tangyin City." Yes, the long column of National Army prisoners is now passing outside Tangyin City on its way to the liberated areas.
    Since midnight on the 9th, the Jin-Cha-Ji People's Liberation Army launched a counterattack against the Chiang-puppet forces on the periphery of Shijiazhuang. On the morning of the 12th, it recovered Luancheng and the important town of Zhengding and stations and strongholds totaling more than sixty places on the Pinghan Railway, annihilating 11,000 troops of Hu Zongnan's Third Army and the puppet Hou Ruyong's forces. At 7:00 PM on the 16th, another unit of the People's Liberation Army cut off the eastern section of the Zhengtai Railway, liberating Huolu, Jingxing, and the famous Jingxing Mining Area in North China. Chiang Kai-shek's Third Army in Shijiazhuang was forced to come to the rescue and has fallen into our army's encirclement.
    In summary, this week, a total of over 40,000 enemy troops were annihilated on all battlefields, and nine cities were recovered. Chiang Kai-shek's decline on the national battlefield is irreversible. Recently, the People's Liberation Army captured Chiang Kai-shek's pamphlet "Spiritual Education for Soldiers for Suppressing Bandits" in northern Henan. Chiang Kai-shek stipulated three battle disciplines for his officers and soldiers: "1. Do not panic when surrounded, 2. Do not surrender when captured, 3. Do not retreat when wounded." The most interesting part is: "In the event of capture, shout: 'Long live the Three Principles of the People,' 'Long live the Chinese Kuomintang, long live Chairman Chiang,' and finally 'commit suicide by cutting your throat.'" Chiang Kai-shek's battle discipline can only be a discipline of "being surrounded," "being captured," and "being wounded." The most that this "Chairman Chiang" can give his subordinates is to "commit suicide" by cutting their throats. (From the 12th to the 18th)

### 各战场我共歼敌四万  蒋介石从此走下坡路

专栏：一周综合战报

    各战场我共歼敌四万
    蒋介石从此走下坡路 
    这一周，捷报雪片飞来。
    西北人民解放军继青化砭大胜后不到廿天，十四日又在瓦窑堡南以八小时的猛勇战斗，干脆的消灭了胡军一三五旅全部、生俘代旅长麦宗禹。把胡宗南摆在山头上长长的队伍拦腰挖掉一块。增援的部队相隔五里呆若木鸡，从旁“观战”。这一胜利使西北战局为之转折，从此胡宗南再也没有上月十九日挟十四个旅之众进攻延安时的气焰。他只能集拢八个旅（其中已被歼一个）排在荒山上对着山头浪费子弹（蒋军被俘团长语）。中央社天天在那里梦呓着：“国军在瓦窑堡以南歼灭共军贺龙部主力一万余人！”究竟谁被歼灭了呢？麦宗禹不久就会出面证明的。胡宗南发明了一个只走路不打仗的“钻隙战术”，可是，他忘记了人民解放军早已张开了罗网，晋南战役被俘的二十七旅副旅长，胡宗南多年的随从亲信王书忱说的好：“胡宗南陷入延安泥坑，不是撤职，便是战死或被俘。”
    晋冀鲁豫人民常胜军刘伯承蒋军部在晋南、豫北的惊人胜利，使战争主动权已完全转入我手。
    陈赓将军雄师长驱挺进，截至十五日，已先后攻克浮山、翼城、＠县、新＠、河津、稷山、万泉、荣河、曲沃、猗氏等十城，歼敌万人以上，控制同蒲南段一百五十余里，确掌秦晋重要门户禹门口，进入民族发祥地汾河三角洲。蒋军重要战略据点运城已直接暴露在我大军阵前。大战方在开始，已经打得蒋介石胡宗南悲痛万分，胡宗南在山西的老窠是被捣毁了。他的后方受到致命的威胁，从许昌到潼关，除了洛阳有一个师守备外，到处都是“空空如也”，胡宗南除了隔河向着禹门口河津我军鸣炮壮胆外，还会有什么办法呢？
    刘伯承将军另一强大兵团，于横扫豫北蒋伪据点，歼敌九千后，又将蒋介石图解汤阴之围的增援部队：四十九旅，六十六师两个旅，四十一师一二二旅，四十七师一二七旅一个团，四十师一个团共五个旅兵力，包围于淇县东北道口以北地区，十六日开始反击，首将蒋介石一个快速纵队歼灭，活捉队长（旅长）李守正。至十八日下午一时，我军以歼灭蒋军两个旅的重大胜利结束了淇县东北大战，人民解放军乘胜收复浚县、滑县、淇县及道口等重镇，歼敌一万三千人。蒋军被歼的第三日，国民党宣传机关竭力嘶喊：“国军到达汤阴城外”。是的，漫长的国军俘虏纵队现正经过汤阴城外开向解放区。
    晋察冀人民解放军自九日午夜反击石家庄外围蒋伪军，十二日晨，收复栾城及平汉线上重镇正定及车站、据点共六十余处，歼胡宗南第三军及伪候如墉部一万一千人。十六日晚七时，人民解放军另一部，切断正太线东段，解放获鹿、井陉及华北著名之井陉矿区，石家庄蒋记第三军被迫出援，已陷入我军包围中。
    综合本周各战场共歼敌四万余人，收复城市九座。蒋介石在全国战场的颓势，是无法挽回的了。最近人民解放军在豫北缴获蒋介石《剿匪士兵精神教育》小册，蒋介石为其官兵规定了三条战斗纪律：“一、被围不惊，二、被俘不屈，三、受伤不退。”其中最饶兴味的：“万一被俘，要高喊：‘三民主义万岁’，‘中国国民党万岁，蒋主席万岁’，最后‘引颈自杀’”。蒋介石的战斗纪律只能是“被围”、“被俘”、“受伤”的纪律，这个“蒋主席”能够给予他的部下的，最多也不过是引颈“自杀”而已。（自十二日至十八日）
