[Report from this newspaper, Ji Lu Yu, dated 14th] The *Ji Lu Yu Daily* recently published a short commentary entitled "Learn from the Second Company of the Wenshang Brigade," stating: The peasant land reform movement is a living class education. In the process of peasants' struggle against landlords, they deeply recognize and experience the cruelty of feudal landlords and the suffering of peasants. Therefore, after the Second Company of Wenshang participated in the peasant land reform movement, their class consciousness was greatly enhanced, and their combat effectiveness and learning enthusiasm were unprecedentedly improved. A valuable experience can be gained from this: It is a very effective way for the troops to devote a certain amount of time to helping the masses with land reform or production during peacetime to improve the consciousness of commanders and fighters. The Second Company of Wenshang was able to achieve such great results primarily because the leaders of the brigade and the Second Company recognized the importance of leading the masses in land reform and set an example. Secondly, they awakened the class consciousness of the soldiers by "speaking bitterness." Thirdly, they launched a movement to commend models and award merits, constantly consolidating and improving the achievements already made. The timely commendation and cultivation of them by the sub-district also played a significant role.

　　翻身运动是活教材
    冀鲁豫日报发表短论
    号召向汶上大队学习
    【本报冀鲁豫十四日电】冀鲁豫日报顷以“向汶上大队二连学习”为题，发表短论称：农民翻身运动是活的阶级教育，在农民对地主的斗争过程中，去深刻的认识和体会封建地主的残酷和农民的痛苦。因此，汶上二连参加农民翻身运动后，阶级觉悟大为提高，战斗力和学习情绪亦因之空前提高。从这里可以得到一个宝贵的经验：部队在平时抽出一定的时间帮助群众翻身或生产，是提高指战员觉悟程度非常有效的办法。汶上二连能获得如此巨大的成绩，首先由于大队及二连领导干部认识到领导群众翻身的重要性，以身作则。其次即以诉苦唤醒了战士们的阶级自觉。第三开展了表模立功运动，不断的巩固和提高既得成绩。分区对他们的及时表扬与培养，亦起了很大作用。
