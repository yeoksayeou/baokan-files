　　Experiences in Improving the Speed-Up Wheel Spinning Wheel
    On the 28th of last month, this column introduced the speed-up wheel spinning wheel. After trial use, the output has indeed greatly increased, but the quality of the yarn produced is not as good as that of the old spinning wheel. A worker from a certain lumber factory has put forward the following suggestions for this, which are specially compiled for your reference:
    (1) It is often difficult to use the speed-up wheel car for the first time, because the speed-up wheel is too fast, and there is no time to pull the thread, the thread is uneven in thickness, and the wrist is tired. The general load of the old spinning wheel is two feet two inches. If the load is lengthened to two feet six inches, the speed-up wheel can be changed to a diameter of two and a half inches first. This makes the learner use the speed-up wheel spinning wheel the same as the old spinning wheel. The speed-up wheel rotates slowly, so there is not enough time to pull the thread. After being proficient, in order to increase the output, the speed-up wheel can be changed to two feet eight inches. This is just right for the right hand to shake twice and the left hand to pull a bucket of thread.
    (2) Use a small piece of pigskin on the top of the spindle to make the spindle spin quietly and quickly.
    (3) White bean silk is more suitable for the speed-up wheel shaft. A piece of tinplate should be wedged into the clip eye of the card shaft to increase the sliding force. In this way, the use of air is large, and the hum is loud. If a small white bean silk is added to the eye, so that the air is small, it can be quiet and fast when shaking.

### 改进加速轮纺车的经验

　　改进加速轮纺车的经验
    上月廿八日本栏曾介绍加速轮纺车，经试用后，产量确大大增加，但所出纱线，质量不如旧纺车。某木厂工人为此提出以下意见，特整理以供大家参考：
    （一）初用加速轮车，常感困难，因加速轮太快，来不及拉线，线粗细不匀，手腕又累。旧纺车一般的担子是二尺二寸，如将担子加长至二尺六寸，加速轮可先改为直径二寸五，这样使初学用加速轮纺车者，摇轮与旧纺车一样，加速轮小转动得慢些，不至忙不及拉线，熟练后为了出品增加，可再将加速轮改用为二寸八，这样用正好是右手摇两遭，左手拉一斗线。
    （二）锭头上用一小块猪皮安上，使锭子转时不响而快。
    （三）加速轮轴用白豆丝较合适，卡轴之夹板眼内，要楔入白铁片，以增加滑力。这样用空度大，嗡嗡嗡响，如加上一小白豆丝楔入眼内，使其空度小，摇动时可不响而快。
