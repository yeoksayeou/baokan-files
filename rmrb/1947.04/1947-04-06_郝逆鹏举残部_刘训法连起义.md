Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 3rd. Hao Pengju's remnant bandits' remnants, one division, one regiment, and two companies, led by Company Commander Liu Xunfa, revolted and came to the liberated area on March 27th. Last month, Hao's remnant bandits, under the surveillance of Chiang's special agents, were transferred from the Longhai Line to the Dongtai, Yancheng, and Funing lines in northern Jiangsu. Liu's company was stationed at Caoniankou. Unwilling to betray the people and become cannon fodder for Chiang Kai-shek, who was on his deathbed in the civil war, they took the name of "mopping up" in the countryside on the 27th, and the entire company escaped from their stronghold and gloriously revolted. Unfortunately, the plan was not kept secret, and Chiang's special agents discovered it and surrounded them. Liu's company fought bravely against the overwhelming enemy for two hours. Finally, Company Commander Liu led five men, carrying two machine guns and two rifles, and broke through the encirclement. The local people's guerrillas arrived in time, and Liu and others were rescued. Liu and others have now safely arrived in the liberated area and are being warmly received by the democratic government.

　　郝逆鹏举残部
  　刘训法连起义
    【新华社华中三日电】苏北郝逆鹏举残部一师一团二连在连长刘训法率领下，于三月二十七日起义来解放区。上月郝逆残部在蒋特监视下，由陇海线开来苏北东台、盐城、阜宁一线，刘连驻草捻口，因不愿背叛人民，为垂死中的蒋介石作内战炮灰，乃于二十七日以下乡“扫荡”为名，全连逃出据点，光荣举义。惜事机不密，为蒋特探悉，将其包围。刘连以寡敌众，激战两小时，最后刘连长率五人，携机枪两挺，步枪两支突围，该地人民游击队赶到，刘等方告脱险。现刘等已安抵解放区，正被民主政府热烈招待。
