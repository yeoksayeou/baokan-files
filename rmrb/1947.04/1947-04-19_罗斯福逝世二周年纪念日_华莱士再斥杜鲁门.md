Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, April 14th: United Press International, Manchester: Wallace, in a speech to over five thousand workers in Manchester on the second anniversary of President Roosevelt's death (April 12th), stated that Roosevelt's tradition lives on in the hearts of millions of Americans today, and the foundation of the American progressive movement is now far stronger than when Roosevelt began his administration in 1932. Wallace criticized Truman's abandonment of Roosevelt's policies, stating that the current Democratic government has stopped fighting for progress, and American progressive people refuse to vote for the Democratic Party, but have not turned to the Republican Party either; they are seeking new leadership.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, April 16th: London: Wallace, the former Vice President of the United States who attracted world attention for criticizing Truman's erroneous foreign policy, delivered another speech on the British Broadcasting Corporation on the evening of the 13th. He firmly opposed the fact that American military power is assisting reactionary governments in certain countries. Wallace said: In some countries, the United States is now using its wealth for strategic and military purposes, rather than to improve the living standards of these countries, making them a huge market for American exports. Wallace recently stated in another speech: "If the United States aids these countries with the means of production rather than with guns, we can alleviate the United States' economic recession. I do not agree with some Americans who, using the 'red threat' as an excuse, attempt to conceal their ambition to control the world. But I agree with some Americans who believe that the United States should rely on supplying countries with various technologies for the purpose of developing production, consumption, trade, and human progress. The security and prosperity of the United States should be built on international cooperation." Wallace finally warned: "All great scientists and other far-sighted people believe that if this is not done, the only outcome will be destruction!"

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, April 13th: New York: The American Progressive Citizens Association recently published a notice in the New York Times, which also quoted speeches by former Vice President Wallace and the famous astronomer Shapley at a rally in Madison Square Garden criticizing Truman's plan. The notice urged readers to demand that senators and representatives support the bills proposed by Pepper and Taylor to hand over the Greek and Turkish issues to United Nations agencies, and to demand that Truman revoke his so-called "sincere order."

　　罗斯福逝世二周年纪念日
    华莱士再斥杜鲁门
    【新华社陕北十四日电】合众社曼彻斯特讯：华莱士于罗斯福总统逝世二周年纪念日（十二日）在曼彻斯特向五千余工人演讲称：罗斯福的传统，今天正活在千百万美国人民的心中，现在美国进步运动的基础已远较一九三二年罗氏开始执政时为坚强。华氏斥责杜鲁门背弃罗斯福政策时称：现民主党政府已停止为进步而奋斗，美国进步人民拒绝投民主党之票，但亦未转向共和党，彼得正寻求新的领导。
    【新华社陕北十六日电】伦敦讯：以抨击杜鲁门错误外交政策而引起世人注目之前美副总统华莱士，于十三日晚又在英国广播公司发表演说。对于美国军事力量援助某些国家反动政府之事实，坚决表示反对。华氏谓：在某些国家，美国现正将其财富用于战略与军事目的方面，而不用于提高此等国家之生活水准，使其为美国输出之巨大市场。华氏最近曾在另一次演说中称：“若美国以生产工具而不以枪炮援助此等国家，吾人大可缓和美国经济之不景气。余不赞同若干美国人士，彼等系以“赤色威胁”为借口，企图掩蔽其控制全世界之野心。但余赞同若干美国人士，彼等认为美国凭供给各国以发展生产、消费、贸易，及以人类进步为目的之各种技术。美国之安全与繁荣，应该建其于国际合作之上。华氏最后警告称：“一切大科学家与其他眼光远大人士，认为若不如此，则惟有毁灭！”
    【新华社陕北十三日电】纽约讯：美国进步公民协会顷在纽约时报发表通告，其中并摘引前副总统华莱士与著名天文学家夏卜勒氏在麻地逊松亚尔公园集会上抨击杜鲁门计划的演辞。该通告敦促读者要求参议员和众议员支持柏卜士与泰勒所提将希土问题交联合国机构的议案，并要求杜鲁门撤销其所谓“真诚的命令”。
