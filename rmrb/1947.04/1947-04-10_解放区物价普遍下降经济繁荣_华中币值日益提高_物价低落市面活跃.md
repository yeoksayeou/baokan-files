　　Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 7th: Since the victories at Su Bei, Lu Nan, and Lu Zhong, the value of the Central China currency has been rising daily. In Qidong and Haimen areas of the ninth sub-district of Suwan, the exchange rate for Chiang Kai-shek's currency is one to twenty. Even near the Chiang-occupied areas of Yancheng and Funing, it is one to two or one to five. Therefore, prices are stable and markets are prosperous in the areas newly liberated from Chiang.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 7th: In late March, prices in the Central China Liberated Areas generally declined, and the credit of the Central China currency increased daily. According to statistics from the important towns of Yilin and Jianyang, rice fell from 11,000 Chiang currency per *hu* (46 *jin*) to 9,000; pork fell from 2,400 yuan per *jin* to 1,600 yuan; gold in Nantong fell from 360,000 to 320,000 yuan.
