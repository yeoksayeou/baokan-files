　　106th Detachment Achieves Outstanding War Exploits
    Military Region Leaders Issue Commendation
    People from Various Counties in Taihang Rush to Northern Henan to Console the Troops
    [Our Northern Henan Front Line Dispatch, 27th] Liu Bocheng, Commander of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Military Region, and Deng Xiaoping, Political Commissar, issued a circular praising the 106th Detachment, the 104th Detachment, and the Taihang Military Region troops for their meritorious service in the recent operations in the Qi-Jun area. The original order stated: "Our 106th Detachment, with its brave, decisive, and swift mobile actions, annihilated the enemy's 49th Brigade (Second Rapid Column), becoming the main key to the victory in the Qi-Jun operation. In particular, the Li Regiment and He Regiment of the Zhao Brigade of the detachment expanded the battle results and acted actively, completing the task of annihilating the enemy. A certain regiment of a certain independent brigade of the Taihang acted in coordination, obeyed orders, and cooperated in action, achieving remarkable results. A circular commending the 106th Detachment and the certain independent brigade is hereby issued. In addition, the Kong Brigade of our 104th Detachment, operating in an extremely difficult-to-deploy narrow area, was also able to decisively, swiftly, and mobilely pursue the enemy, rush into Baisi, intercepting and annihilating the main force of the 596th Regiment of the enemy's 199th Brigade, capturing a total of 1,800 enemy soldiers, which is also worthy of commendation."
    [Our Taihang Dispatch, 25th] In order to boost the morale of the front and celebrate the merits of the soldiers, the consolation groups organized by model military dependents and labor heroes from Huguan, Changzhi, Lucheng, Licheng and other counties have rushed to the front line in northern Henan. They are carrying a large number of comfort bags carefully made by women from various places and other comfort items. Before the Huguan consolation group set off, the masses told the consolation group to tell the soldiers about the production, emancipation, and helping military families to establish housework in the rear, and to solicit the soldiers' opinions, so as to truly achieve close unity between the front and the rear. At the same time, drama troupes from Zuoquan, Changzhi, Lucheng, Licheng and other counties and Zhangbin Middle School have also arrived at the front one after another.
