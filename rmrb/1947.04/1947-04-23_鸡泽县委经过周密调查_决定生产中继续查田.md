    Jize County Party Committee After Careful Investigation
    Decides to Continue Land Investigation During Production
    [This newspaper's dispatch] The Jize County Party Committee, based on the county's situation, has issued instructions calling for the continued implementation of land investigation. The instructions stated: According to investigations in places such as Beifengzheng, Limaichang, Huanggu, South Street in the city, and Xiaozhai Village (which we have always considered to have been thoroughly overturned), many problems have been discovered: (1) The land, houses, clothing, and food of basic masses are far worse than those of landlords. Some landlords in Huanggu still live in high-rise tile-roofed houses with sunny gates and deep alleys, while poor and hired peasants generally live in small, dilapidated houses and wear ragged clothes. In Beifengzheng, 13 households have not been overturned; in Xiaozhai, 14 households; and in South Street, 18 households. Before the struggle, landlords used methods such as fake family divisions to disperse and conceal land and property, and still occupy a considerable amount of good land. (2) The masses' sense of ownership is far from adequate, and they accept the "free labor" land from landlords. In Huanggu Village (130 poor peasant households), one-third have a fatalistic view and dare not live in the houses they fought for. (3) The arrogance of the landlords has not been broken down. Because the methods adopted were mostly automatic land donations (such as in Xiaozhai, where six households were struggled against and fourteen households automatically donated land), the landlords are still carefree and at ease. The above fully proves that the landlords have not been defeated and the masses have not been fully mobilized, giving the landlords an opportunity to sow discord in the village and create disunity between cadres and the masses. This is the root cause of the problem. We, however, do not know where the root cause lies and are always finding fault with village cadres, engaging in "reducing the fat and supplementing the lean." In the future, we should focus on squeezing the landlords first and thoroughly implement "filling in the gaps and making things even." To this end, we must pay attention to overcoming complacency and enlightening the peasants ideologically. We must conduct door-to-door inspections to ensure that everyone is overturned. Currently, we must continue to investigate land in conjunction with production to strive for the complete realization of land reform.

    鸡泽县委经过周密调查
    决定生产中继续查田
    【本报讯】鸡泽县委顷依据本县情况，发出指示，号召继续贯彻查田。指示略称：根据北风正、李马昌、黄沟、城里南街、小寨村等处（是我们一向认为翻身已彻底的）的调查，发现不少问题：（一）基本群众之土地、房屋、衣、食比地主还差得很远，黄沟部分地主仍住着高楼瓦房向阳门，深胡同，而贫雇农则普遍住着陕小房子，穿的破烂不堪；北风正有十三户、小寨有十四户、南街有十八户都未翻身，地主则在斗争前用假分家等办法分散隐蔽土地财物，至今仍占有相当数量的好地。（二）群众主人翁思想自觉远不够，接受地主“白推”地，黄沟一村（一三○户贫农），有三分之一的有命运观点，斗争的房子不敢住。（三）地主气势仍未被打垮，因方法上多采取自动献田的结果，（如小寨斗争六户，自动献田十四户），地主仍消遥自在，泰然自若。上述种种完全证明了地主未打垮，群众未充分发动，给地主以可乘之机，在村里挑拨离间，形成干群不团结，这就是总病根。而我们不知病根之所在，老在村干部身上找毛病“去肥补瘦”，今后应着重先在地主身上挤，把“填平补齐”一直贯彻到底。为此必须注意克服自满情绪，注意从思想上启发农民觉悟，挨户检查做到人人翻身，目前要结合生产继续查田，以争取土地改革的彻底实现。
