Measures to Prevent the Spread of Livestock Plague

Recently, chicken plague, swine fever, and cattle plague have been continuously discovered in various places. Livestock power is already lacking, and if prompt measures are not taken for treatment, it will inevitably affect spring plowing, and the development of sideline businesses will also be severely impacted. This is one of the problems that must be addressed and emphasized in the Great Production Movement. We are providing a summary of the experiences in controlling livestock plague from various regions for everyone's reference, and we hope to attract everyone's attention to mobilize the experience and creativity of the broad masses to eradicate the spreading epidemic.

(1) Chicken Plague Prevention Method: As the saying goes, "prevention is better than cure." The same is true for livestock. Moreover, places where plagues have not occurred still account for the vast majority, so the first thing to emphasize should be disease prevention.

Preventive Measures: (1) Upon discovering a sick chicken, quickly isolate it and keep it away from healthy chickens. Bury dead chickens more than two feet deep to prevent transmission. People who have fed sick chickens should wash their hands with boiled water or salt water before feeding healthy chickens. (2) Illness enters through the mouth, and the same is true for chickens. It is best not to feed chickens rotten food and give them clean water to drink. Adding a little salt or charcoal powder to the chicken feed can aid digestion, or feeding them one centigram of sulfur daily can purify the blood. It doesn't have to be every day; feeding them every few days is also fine. (3) Chicken coops should be dry and sunny, chicken manure should be dug out frequently, and lime should be sprinkled often. If there is no lime, sprinkle some wood ash. There are many ways to treat chicken diseases, and they are all experiences that have been successfully tested hundreds of times by the masses. The problem is that there is a treatment method for each disease, and the difficulty lies in not being able to accurately identify the disease, resulting in the wrong medicine being prescribed. After trying and not seeing any improvement, people lose confidence. Treatment methods for several diseases: (1) If the chicken's crop is swollen and it cannot digest, and it is listless, use a small knife to cut open the crop, empty out the contents, and wash out the odor with salt water until there is no more mucus. Sew it up with white thread, feed it thin porridge daily, and give it warm water to drink. It should recover in seven or eight days. (2) If the chicken has diarrhea, is listless, and even passes blood in severe cases, feed it two or three mung bean-sized grains of coarse salt every morning, for three or four times, or grind one grain of croton bean into powder, add a little vegetable oil, and administer it. (3) If the chicken does not eat or move, droops its head, and its wings and tail hang down, and it sometimes leans forward or backward, and the comb turns black, prick the chicken's feet and wings with a needle to draw a few drops of dark purple blood, then administer some oil, some Ten Drops Oil, or sesame oil.

Similarly, for pig diseases, it is important to focus on prevention first. Pigsties should be clean, with plenty of straw and stove ash or lime sprinkled to keep them dry. Do not feed them rotten food. If an epidemic occurs, do not let the pigs run around. If a sick pig is found, quickly isolate it from healthy pigs. You can also give them some anti-plague medicine regularly: about one ounce each of Atractylodes lancea, Angelica dahurica, Asarum, and realgar, ground into fine powder and placed in the pig feed. Several treatment methods for pig diseases: (1) For swine fever, give an injection on the left and right sides of the tail root, one injection in the middle of each hoof cleft, and cut a small opening at the tip of the ear. If black teeth are found, remove them and rub with salt water. (2) If the pig does not eat, add some green vegetables and salt to the pig feed, or feed it half an ounce of chili and one ounce of ginger powder for three days. If it has dry stool or does not urinate, use one ounce of mirabilite dissolved in boiling water and mixed into the pig feed, or add three ounces of sesame oil. For diarrhea, mash garlic, add a little salt, and put it in the pig feed, or dissolve half an ounce each of mirabilite and rhubarb in boiling water and put it in the pig feed, or mix one ounce each of bone charcoal powder and wood charcoal powder into the pig feed. (3) For pig lockjaw, the pig has a fever, shivers, coughs, has difficulty breathing, its neck is swollen, and it bleeds all over after death. Treatment: Regularly feeding broad bean water in spring and autumn can prevent it. Bake hemp leaves until dry, mix with a little honey, and feed it, or feed it one egg and two ounces of sesame oil, or feed it three mace of crude sodium sulfate, one mace of bitter sulfur, and two mace of rhubarb. (4) Pig smallpox, also known as "pimple disease," causes red spots on the body. The pig does not want to eat, its head droops, and it lies down like a dog with its snout in the ground. It is most severe in March and April, is easily transmitted, and the pigs die quickly. Use Cimicifuga and peas to treat it. For the prevention of cattle diseases, the first thing to pay attention to is to keep the cattle pen clean and dry, with frequent bedding of firewood and soil. Pay attention to clean fodder. If a disease is found, isolate it from healthy cattle. Treatment methods for cattle diseases: (1) Cattle plague is a filterable virus that exists in the blood, tissues, and secretions of sick cattle, such as nasal discharge and feces. Healthy cattle become infected when they come into contact with the blood, secretions, and excretions of sick cattle or eat the fodder left by sick cattle. It takes three to nine days for the disease to become apparent. Afterwards, the cattle develop a high fever, do not eat fodder, have inflammation of the conjunctiva, and white spots appear on the nictitating membrane of the eyes, which ulcerate and expand into nodules, first drooling. After the body temperature drops, they die in two or three days or turn into chronic cases. Treatment: Immunizing by subcutaneous, intramuscular or intravenous injection of serum is effective. (2) If the cow has diarrhea, sometimes with blood or with egg white-like substances, and sometimes has a swollen neck and refuses to eat grass, treat it with three ounces of mirabilite, one ounce of salt, and one mace of chili powder, mixed with warm boiled water and administered. The next day, dissolve three ounces of lime in water, clarify it, and administer it with half a bowl of rice soup. If the neck is swollen, pierce it with a fire needle to drain the black water, and it will recover. (3) For cattle heat disease, the mouth and nose smell foul, and the tip of the nose is dry. Fifteen eggs and two ounces of sesame oil will cure it. (4) For yellow hooves in cattle, the hooves are swollen, and sometimes pus and yellow liquid come out of the hooves. This is caused by damp cattle pens. Wash the hooves with a 10% warm salt water solution three times a day. After washing, apply clear oil. If the hooves are festering, use a knife to cut away the rotten flesh, wash with salt water, and then sprinkle some borax or borneol powder.

　　防治畜瘟蔓延办法
    边府办公室  益农
    近来各地不断发现鸡瘟、猪瘟、牛瘟，畜力本来缺乏，如不急起设法治疗，势必影响春耕，副业发展亦将受到严重打击，是大生产运动中必需注意解决的问题之一。特综合各地制止畜瘟经验，供大家参考，并希望引起大家的注意，发挥广大群众的经验与创造，扑灭蔓延着的瘟疫。
    （一）鸡瘟防治法：俗话说“治病不如防病”，畜类也是这样，况且没有发生瘟疫的地方还是占绝大多数，所以第一应着重注意防病。
    预防办法：（一）发现了病鸡，赶快隔离开，不要和好鸡在一块，鸡病死了，埋二尺深以下，免得传染。喂了病鸡的人，要用开水或食盐水洗洗手，再去喂好鸡。（二）病从口入，鸡也是一样，平常喂鸡最好不吃腐烂了的东西，喝些干净水，鸡食里加点盐或木炭末，可以助消化，或每天喂一厘硫磺可以清血，不经常喂隔几天喂一次也好。（三）鸡窝要干燥向阳，勤挖鸡粪，常撒些石灰，没石灰的撒点柴灰也好。治鸡病的办法很多，都是群众里经过几百次试验成功的经验，问题是一种病是一种治法，困难在审查不清病，结果药不对症，试了一下治不好，就没有了信心。几种病的几种治法：（一）鸡嗉肿不消化，打扼没精神，用小刀把嗉子割开掏完里面的东西，用食盐水洗净里面的臭味，洗到没有粘液时为止，用白线缝好，每天喂些稀饭，喝些温水，过七八天就可以好了。（二）鸡拉稀屎，没精神，重的还拉血，每天早晨喂它两三粒小豆颗大的大盐，喂三四次或用巴豆一粒研成碎末，再加入植物油少许灌下。（三）鸡不吃不动，垂头跌两翅和尾下垂，时而前、后仰，鸡冠发黑，用针扎鸡脚和翅膀，流几点黑紫血再灌点油，灌些十滴水或大麻油。
      猪病同样是要先注意预防，猪圈要干净，多垫草和炉灰或撒些石灰，常保持干燥，喂东西不要喂腐烂了的。如发生瘟疫不要让猪乱跑，发现了病猪赶快与好猪隔离。平时还可吃些防瘟药：苍术、白芷、细辛、雄黄各一两左右，研成细末，放在猪食里。猪病的几种治疗法：（一）猪瘟在尾巴根下左右各扎一针，蹄缝中间各扎一针，耳尖割破一小口，如发现黑牙时将黑牙拨去擦些盐水。（二）猪不吃东西时给猪食里加些青菜、食盐，或用辣子半两，姜末一两吃三天。拉干屎或不拉尿则用芒硝一两，用开水化开掺在猪食里或加三两大麻油。拉稀屎把蒜捣烂加点盐放在猪食里或用芒硝、大黄各半两开水化开放在猪食里，或用骨炭粉、木炭粉各一两许和在猪食里。（三）猪锁喉风，患此病者猪身发烧发抖咳嗽，呼吸困难，脖肿，死后全身出血。治法：春秋季节常喂＠豆水可以预防，把麻叶烤干和点蜂蜜喂下，或喂鸡蛋一个麻油二两，或喂皮硝有三钱，硫苦一钱，大黄二钱。（四）猪天花又叫出痘子，身上起红点，不肯吃，头下垂，像狗一样伏着卧，嘴撅在土里，一般在三四月间最厉害，最容易传染，死的也最快，用升麻豌豆可治。牛病的预防，首先也要注意牛圈清洁干燥，勤垫柴草、勤垫土，草料要注意干净，发现了病要与好牛隔离开。牛病的治法：（一）牛瘟是滤过性毒，存在病牛的血液组织分泌物如鼻涕及大小便中，好牛接触了病牛的血液分泌排泄，或吃病牛吃剩的草料，就会传染好牛。得病三天到九天还看不出来，以后便发高烧，不吃草料，眼膜发炎，牛眼屎内蜃生白点，溃疡扩结成块，先流口水。体温下降后，两三天就死，或转成慢性。治法：用免疫血清施皮下肌肉或静脉注射有特效。（二）牛拉稀屎，有时带血，也有带蛋清似的东西，有的还肿脖子，不肯吃草，治法：用芒硝三两、食盐一两、辣子末一钱，用温开水调和灌下。第二天再用石灰三两水化开澄清和半碗米汤灌一次，如果脖子肿，用火针扎破，使黑水流尽就可以好。（三）牛热病，口鼻发臭，鼻尖发干，用鸡子十五个，麻油二两灌下即好。（四）牛蹄黄，蹄子肿，有时蹄部出浓，流黄水，是由于牛圈潮湿引起的，用百分之十温盐水洗蹄子，一天洗三次，洗过后抹上清油，如果蹄子里化脓，用刀子削去烂肉，盐水洗净后再撒上些硼砂或冰片粉。
