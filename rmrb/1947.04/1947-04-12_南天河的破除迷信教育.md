　　The mobilization of the masses in Tianhe Village is inseparable from the elimination of feudal superstitious ideas. There are 144 households in this village. 35 households are in the "Holy Man" sect, 25 households are in the Yiguan sect, 15 households are in the Qingsha sect, 1 household is in the Longhua Sacred Assembly sect, and 15 households are in the Daxianguan sect. A total of 91 households, accounting for about 64 percent of the total households, were involved in these sects. Even those who were not in the sects believed in ghosts and destiny. These sects have a history of nearly decades. In addition, there is a shaman and a fortune teller in the village. Feudal superstitious ideas seriously dominated the masses and became a major obstacle to the struggle for emancipation, especially among the "backward" elements and women, whose minds were filled with ideas of ghosts, gods, and destiny.
    During the movement, the leadership believed that the land reform could not be carried out thoroughly unless the masses' ideological obstacles were broken. Therefore, it was decided to carry out mass anti-superstition education. First, the village cadres were enlightened to discuss the issue. It was found that more than 75 percent of the cadres were still full of superstitious ideas about ghosts and gods. At that time, in view of the specific situation, it was proposed to discuss questions such as: Is the spirit writing of Daxianguan effective? What are the advantages and disadvantages of secret societies? Is the fortune-telling of the shaman true or false? The masses were organized to discuss these questions, and each person was encouraged to talk about their personal experiences rather than just talking in abstract terms. During the discussion, it was found that there were several types of people: one type had recognized that the gods were deceitful through their personal experiences. For example, the poor peasant Wang Wudou, whose fortune teller had said he was only worth two liang and four qian of life and would never be able to get rich, had now initially turned himself over and had begun to get rich, so he firmly did not believe in gods. The poor peasant Cao Haishui had fled famine in the past. His family went to Daxianguan for spirit writing, and Daxianguan said he had died outside. But soon he came back, and he no longer believed in Daxianguan. There were not many of these people. Another type was half-believing and half-doubting. For example, the vice chairman of the women's association had sought medicine once when she was ill and her illness was cured, but she had no children, and she had sought gods many times but still had no children, so she did not believe in gods very much. There were many of these people. There was also a type that was deeply superstitious. In the past, when they suffered from disasters and diseases, they sought gods, and if they happened to get better, they thought the gods were effective. There were also quite a few of these people. After studying this situation, the first type of people were quickly seized to be cultivated as anti-superstition activists, and discussions continued to be brewed: If there are gods, why are they sometimes effective and sometimes not? Who has seen heaven? Is it better to suffer in life or to enjoy happiness? Why do gods want things and money when they treat diseases? Who used them? During this discussion, the masses made great progress in their thinking. Some used the harm they had suffered themselves to vividly educate the masses. For example, Guo Yushun's mother-in-law said: "My son was ill and had spirit writing in Daxianguan. The first dose of medicine made the illness worse, the second dose was even worse, and the third dose killed him; I had no money to buy a coffin and borrowed 18 yuan from Daxianguan and couldn't pay the interest. People pledged all the land, and the Eighth Route Army came and took the land back, and we had food and clothing. Believing in gods made me lose everything, and I will never believe in them again." She cried as she spoke. This gave the masses great education and emotion.
    In order to further solve the superstitious ideas of the masses, typical superstitious figures were seized to have their thinking cleared, and they were organized to personally confess and educate the masses. First, more than ten people, including shamans, fortune tellers, spirit writing masters, and heads of Taoist societies, were mobilized. It was analyzed that these people were mostly middle peasants from poor backgrounds, and most of them took this path because they were forced by life. During the mobilization process, it was found that they were most clear about the inside story of "ghosts and gods" in their minds. They all understood that they were deceiving people and talking nonsense, but they had ideological concerns and were unwilling to confess. One was that they had deceived people in the past and it was embarrassing to come out, and the other was that they were afraid of being liquidated and struggled with for deceiving and using people's money. Based on their thinking, the leadership proposed: It's not your fault for doing this in the past, it's the landlords' fault; it's shameful if the masses are enlightened but you are not. The more you confess, the more you show your awareness and the more glorious it is; you are also forced by poverty for life, and the masses will never liquidate you... This encouraged their courage to confess; on the other hand, cadres and activists were mobilized to not attack those who were heavily superstitious, but to encourage them to think boldly and freely, and to guide the masses with the exposure of their true thoughts. After several major brewing sessions, Shaman Wang first became enlightened and was willing to make a typical confession. She said sadly at the mass meeting: "I was exploited by the landlords in the past and had nothing to eat or drink. I had no choice but to become a shaman to earn some money to spend; now that Chairman Mao is leading us to turn ourselves over, I will never do that again, ghosts and gods are all fake." The masses asked her what was going on with the descending of the god, and asked her to descend the god again. She said: "That's all deceiving people, now you don't need to burn incense, I will descend, I am the god." Then she said in the tone of descending the god: "In the past, the people relied on the heavens, and they never turned themselves over for thousands of years. Since Chairman Mao came, the poor have food and clothing, who would go to believe in superstition again, everyone should quickly engage in production, and suppress the rich." After her confession, the masses' superstitious ideas were further broken, and the anti-superstition sentiment was very high. Some automatically took the idols and burned them at the conference, and some tore off the idols and replaced them with portraits of Chairman Mao. The leadership immediately seized the opportunity to educate the masses: ghosts and gods are tricks played by the landlords, mainly to control the minds of the poor and prevent them from resisting forever. Poverty is due to exploitation, not fate. Turning over depends on the Communist Party and oneself. The poor should unite and fight against the feudal landlords. After this anti-superstition ideological education, the masses went a step further. The experience of anti-superstition ideological education is summarized as follows:
    1. To solve such a mass ideological problem and implement democratic and free thought, first expose the true thoughts of the masses in all aspects, and then guide the masses to discuss and criticize their personal experiences, educate themselves, and seek complete ideological awareness. 2. Seizing the witches and gods to clear their minds, dispel their concerns, and mobilize them to confess has the greatest effect, because they are most clear about whether there are gods or not. 3. Seizing those who have been deceived and are most superstitious about gods to be cultivated as anti-superstition activists, their facts of being deceived are the most vivid educational materials. 4. Analyze the composition and origin of the heads of Taoist societies. If they are poor people who are forced by life, they should be enlightened to consciously think about solving the problem. If they are feudal ruling figures, they should be combined with liquidation and struggle. After education, the masses realized that superstition is a vicious means used by the feudal rulers to oppress the masses. After awakening, they bravely rose up and fought against the feudal forces. Finally, the complete elimination of superstitious ideas will depend on the gradual improvement of cultural and scientific knowledge after the turn over. For example, scientific understanding of some natural phenomena such as wind, clouds, thunder, lightning, and will-o'-the-wisps is necessary knowledge to eliminate superstition. During this discussion of ghosts and gods, the masses raised many such questions.

　　南天河的破除迷信教育
    张建峰
    天河村群众的发动，与封建迷信思想的破除是分不开的。这村共一百四十四户，在圣人道的三十五户，在一贯道的二十五户，在清沙教的十五户，在龙华圣会教的一户，在大仙教的十五户，共计九十一户约占全户数的百分之六十四，不在教的也相信鬼神命运。这些道和教差不多都有数十年的历史，另外这村还有一个神婆，一个算命先生，封建迷信思想严重的统治着群众，成为翻身斗争的重大障碍，特别是“落后”层和妇女，更是一脑袋鬼神命运观点。
    运动中领导上认为群众这一思想障碍不打破，就无法彻底进行土地改革，乃确定开展群众性的反迷信教育。首先启发村干部讨论，发现干部中有百分之七十五以上还充满迷信鬼神思想，当时便针对具体情况提出：大仙扶乩灵不灵？会门有啥好处坏处？神婆算命是真是假？组织群众讨论，提倡各人说自己亲身经验的事，不要空谈。讨论中发现有几种人：一种是亲身经验中认识了神仙是欺骗，如贫农王五豆，算命先生曾说他是二两四钱命，永不能发家，现在初步翻身已开始发了家，坚决不信神。贫农曹海水过去灾荒年逃荒出外，家人到大仙那里扶乩，大仙说死在外边了，但不久他又回来了，再也不信大仙的话，这种人不很多。另一种是半信半疑的，如妇会副主席有病求了次药病好了，但她没孩，求了多次神仍然没孩，也就不大相信神了，这种人很多。还有一种是迷信很深的，过去灾病求神，偶碰好了的就以为神灵，这样人也不少。研究了这种情况后，即抓紧培养第一种人为反迷信的积极分子，继续酝酿讨论：既有神为啥有时灵有时不灵？谁见过天堂？活着受罪好还是享福好？神看病为啥要东西要钱？谁用了？这次讨论中群众思想有很大进展，有些用自己切身受的害，生动的教育了群众，如郭玉顺的岳母说：“我儿有病在大仙堂扶乩，第一付药吃了病加重，第二付更重，第三付就死了；没钱买棺材在大仙堂借了十八元还不上利，人家把地全押去了，八路军来了才把地抽回，有吃有穿，信神倒把儿也信没了，我再也不信它。”说着就哭起来。这给群众极大教育和感动。
    为了更进一步解决群众迷信思想，即抓紧打通典型迷信人物思想，组织他们亲自坦白教育群众，首先动员神婆、算命的、扶乩师及道会门负责人约十余人，分析这些人大都是贫雇中农，大多数是为生活所迫才走这道的。动员过程中发现他们思想上对“鬼神”的内幕是最清楚的，都明白是欺骗人说白话，但他们思想有顾虑不愿坦白，一是过去欺骗人说出面子难看，一是骗用人家钱怕清算斗争。领导上根据他们的思想提出：过去干这不怪你们怪地主；群众觉悟了你们不觉悟可耻，越坦白越表现觉悟越光荣；你们也是为生活穷困所迫，群众决不清算你们……这样鼓励了他们坦白的勇气；另一方面又动员干部积极分子，对迷信厉害的不能打击，应启发他大胆自由思想，以自己真实思想之暴露来引导群众。经过几大酝酿，王神婆首先觉悟，愿意作典型坦白。她在群众会上沉痛的说：“我过去叫地主剥削的没吃没喝，没奈何就当了神婆，来弄几个钱花；现在毛主席领导翻了身，我再不干那了，鬼神都是假的。”群众问她下神是怎回事，叫她再下下神，她说：“那都是骗人的，现在你不用烧香，我来下，我就是神。”接着她就用下神的音调说：“过去黎民靠老天，几千年也没把身翻，自从来了毛主席，穷人有吃又有穿，谁还再去信迷信，大家快些搞生产，就把富根按。”经过她的坦白，群众迷信思想进一步被打破，反迷信情绪很高，有些自动拿神像在大会上烧了，有些撕下神像换上毛主席像。领导上当即抓紧教育群众：鬼神是地主们弄的把戏，主要是统治住穷人思想叫你永不反抗，穷是受剥削，不是命，翻身靠共产党靠自己，穷人应团结起来和封建地主斗争等。经过这次反迷信的思想教育，群众又深入一步展开。总结反迷信思想教育的经验如下：
    １、对这样群众性的思想问题的解决，并贯彻民主自由思想，首先暴露群众各方面真实思想，然后引导群众以自己切身经验讨论批判，自己教育自己，求得思想上彻底自觉。２、抓紧巫神打通他们思想，解除他们顾虑，动员他们坦白，这种作用最大，因他们最清楚有神没神。３、抓紧亲身受骗最迷信神的人培养为反迷信的积极分子，他们的受骗事实是最生动的教育材料。４、分析道会门头子的成份来历，如是贫苦群众为生活所迫，则应启发其自觉思想解决问题，如是封建统治人物则应结合清算斗争。经过教育使群众认识迷信是封建统治者压迫群众毒辣手段的一种，觉悟后更勇敢的起来和封建势力斗争。最后关于迷信思想的彻底扫清无遗，有些还要靠翻身后文化科学知识的逐渐提高。如对一些自然现象风云雷电鬼火等问题的科学了解，是扫清迷信的必要知识，这次讨论鬼神过程中群众提出很多这类问题。
