　　Yangcheng's 3,700 Militiamen Join the War
    "Night Pearl" Leads the Expedition
    [Our Dispatch] The Yangcheng militia are determined to protect Chairman Mao with victorious battles and cooperate with the main forces in combat. In particular, the militia of the Third District, in 20 days, rushed to complete manure hauling and other work before spring plowing. Each person prepared two pairs of shoes and a single layer of clothing, bringing enough bombs and landmines, prepared for a long expedition. On the 29th of last month, they received orders, and on the morning of the 30th, led by "Night Pearl," arrived at the county meeting. The militia from other districts also arrived at the designated locations on time. In the gaps before departure, each company and each squad launched heated discussions, challenged each other, and formulated plans to kill the enemy, determined to protect Chairman Mao and defend the Liberated Area. At the time of departure, "Night Pearl" called on: all village militiamen to be brave and everyone to fight desperately, cooperate with the main force, eliminate the Chiang-Hu troops, protect Chairman Mao, and perform meritorious service for the people. Everyone responded with thunderous "resolutions", and headed towards the expeditionary journey迎着迎着 and under the warm spring breeze. Currently, more than 3,700 militiamen and self-defense forces in the county have rushed to the front line to cooperate with the main forces in combat. (Ke Ming)
