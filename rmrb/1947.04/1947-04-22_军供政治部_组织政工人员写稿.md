    Military Supply Political Department
    Organizes Political Workers to Write Articles
    [Our Newspaper] The political work conference of the Military Region Supply Department began on the 8th and concluded victoriously on the 14th after seven days of discussion. In addition to reviewing past work and how to develop the meritorious service campaign in the future, Director Zheng of the Political Department repeatedly mentioned in his report and summary that organizing and mobilizing everyone to write for the Party newspaper is one of the tasks of political work, and political workers should do it themselves. The participating cadres unanimously stated that they will not only write for the Party newspaper themselves in the future, but also organize everyone to write for the Party newspaper. During the meeting, each cadre picked up a pen, recalled the work they had done, and wrote articles. Director Zheng and the comrades from the Political Department patiently helped everyone to revise them one by one. Newspaper reporting work will be more active in the future. (Li Naihua)

    军供政治部
    组织政工人员写稿
    【本报讯】军区供给部政工会议由八日开始，经七天的讨论，已于十四日胜利闭幕。该会议除检讨过去工作和今后如何开展立功运动外，政治部郑主任在其报告与总结中曾再三提及组织与发动大家给党报写稿为政治工作任务之一，政工人员应亲自动手等。与会干部均一致表示：今后不但自己给党报写稿，而且要组织大家给党报写稿。在会议期间，每个干部都拿起笔来，回忆自己所作过的工作，写成稿件。郑主任及政治部的同志们均在耐心的帮助大家一一删改。今后报导工作将会更加活跃。    （李乃华）
