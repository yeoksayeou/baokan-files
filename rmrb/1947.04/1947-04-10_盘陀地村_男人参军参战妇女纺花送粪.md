　　Pantuo Village
	Men Join the Army and Fight, Women Spin Cotton and Deliver Manure
　　[Report from Hukuan by our newspaper] Pantuo Village in the First District is simultaneously engaging in military recruitment, fighting the enemy, land surveying, and preparing for spring plowing. The entire village held a meeting to discuss and specifically define the division of labor. The military cadre led the young and strong to participate in the war, while the men who stayed behind formed land surveying teams based on their different abilities. The women formed manure delivery teams, and set specific times for spinning cotton and delivering manure, as well as methods for calculating work points. In particular, women Li Hanhua and Wang Gaize (both family members of soldiers) said, "Today Chairman Mao is leading us to eradicate poverty. If we want to secure a prosperous life, we must rely on our own hard work. We can't just sit around and wait for assistance." Twenty days after the soldiers left to join the army, her team (of six people) delivered a total of 200 cartloads of manure. They are now preparing to break up the clods of earth in the fields and spin 30 jin of cotton. Their slogan is: "Men fight Chiang Kai-shek at the front, women engage in production in the rear."

    男人参军参战妇女纺花送粪
    【本报壶关讯】一区盘陀地村一面参军、参战、丈地，一面准备春耕。全村开会研究，具体确定分工，武干率领青壮年参战，留在家的男人按各个不同能力，成立丈地组，妇女们成立运粪组，并定出纺花、运粪时间及计折工办法；特别是妇女李涵花、王改则（都是军属）说：“今天毛主席领导咱已经拔了穷根，要想安富根必须靠自己亲手劳动，咱坐着光等照顾是不行。”自参军走后二十天，她这个组（六人）共运粪二百车。现准备打地里的土圪塔，并纺花三十斤，她们的口号是：“男人前方打蒋贼，女人后方搞生产”。（宗昌、学富）
