　　Ideological Review
    Ren Village Masses Reveal Thoughts to Cure Heart Troubles
    Zhan Chao
    From the end of February to mid-March in the Gregorian calendar, the land reform in Ren Village was in the stage of in-depth review. Its characteristic was mass participation, an ideological review movement carried out on the basis of conscious awareness.
    After the Lunar New Year, in the in-depth movement in Ren Village, on the one hand, it was discovered that special agents were trying to organize a counter-offensive, and there were still a few "air-raid shelters" for landlords within the peasants. The fruits of struggle, such as clothes and furniture, were distributed for ten to twenty days, and there were still opinions after repeated adjustments. On the other hand, the tired and complacent mood of cadres and activists began to grow. At this time, the entire Lin County proposed an in-depth review. The leading group of district and village cadres and activists held a meeting to discuss: The review is to thoroughly defeat the landlords, leaving no feudal vestiges, so that we poor people can completely turn ourselves over! But what does it mean to be thoroughly defeated and turned over? Does sweeping the landlords out of the house count as a thorough defeat? Does it count as a complete turnaround when we honest peasants dare to stand up and speak out and fight? Some said, "Yes!" Some said, "No!" The leadership then guided everyone to analyze the previous stage of the movement and study the current problems: Why do special agents take advantage of loopholes, why are there still "air-raid shelters," and why has it been impossible to fill the gaps in the fruits of struggle? Finally, everyone unanimously realized that "Our Ren Village is not yet thorough!" "If our thinking doesn't turn over, nothing will work!" After the activists cleared their minds, they went to the masses to widely deliberate and discuss this matter. At this time, a new question was raised: "How can we turn over our thinking?" The cadres said, "Let's all talk about what ideas we have in the struggle? Where do you think it's inappropriate? ... Tell the truth!" But no one said anything in the people's school. The leadership's research result was that in the previous period, the special agents saw that the masses had opinions about filling in the gaps in the fruits of struggle such as clothes and furniture, and encouraged the masses to replace the chairman of the Second Street Farmers' Association, saying that the chairman of the Farmers' Association was falsely pretending to be clean, and this time he also embezzled a gold-lettered cloth shirt and two vats of grain. After the masses discussed it in the school, it was proved that it was fabricated by the special agent, and the special agent Wei Xiande had to confess the "truth" in public. Since then, everyone has been afraid to mention "telling the truth," which is a major stumbling block in front of the masses' ideological turnaround.
    The Second Street relied on the activists to collude and first broke through this barrier. At that time, the public security cadre Shi Yangxian was helping with work in the Second Street. He chatted with several activists and asked Yuan Qiaohua, "You moved from a broken house to a good estate, what do you think?" "You must feel a little different in your heart, right?" Slowly, slowly, he led Qiaohua to open up. She said, "I don't know if it's superstition or what? This time, after filling the gaps in our family, we were given a felt and a quilt, and my mother-in-law happened to have a sore on her body!" "These years, not respecting the gods hasn't caused any confusion, but this time, after filling the gaps, my mother-in-law has a sore on her body, and I feel itchy in my heart. I don't know if it's fearing the landlord or what?!" Lao Shi listened and encouraged her, saying, "You have always been an activist in the movement. This time, in the ideological turnaround review movement, you should be an ideological model and use the truth to connect with people." Qiaohua agreed. She first looked for a few women who were concerned about things, and while working, she chatted and said, "Let's say whatever we have to say!" She then told in detail her thoughts since filling the felt and her mother-in-law having a sore on her body, and said, "I don't know what the ghosts are doing. I even thought about burning incense in front of the stove god, but I was afraid of being seen by others!" Those women said, "Oh! Qiaohua, you said it first! I've been feeling uneasy in my heart for a long time! But we're just chatting among sisters, don't say it at the conference!" The town government secretary Zhang Hong's mother said, "Qiaohua, people are complaining, but I have to complain to you about my grievances. That year, Wang Zixue (a special agent) was the town head, and he called on the masses to struggle. Su Yinghao (a bully, special agent landlord) was the secretary, and he also became a special agent. My child took over his work, and I felt terrified in my heart. I thought this time it was our turn. My Hong said that those who are being struggled against are special agent landlords, and it will definitely not be our turn. I thought my Hong was saying comforting words. I was also afraid of being struggled against for not being active in my work, so I told my Hong that the accounts should be clear and concise, and the procedures should be explained in detail. Seeing my Hong coming back talking and laughing, I felt happy in my heart. Seeing him coming back with few words, I was worried, thinking that he would be struggled against soon. In the past, people used to save money and use it frugally, but since then, I've been thinking of living one day at a time. Every time I heard about a struggle, I felt scared in my heart!" Peng Fushan's wife said that she also participated in the struggle and asked for things in the in-depth movement, but she always couldn't stand to see people being beaten. She stood in the front for fear of being said to be backward. After many women finished speaking their minds, they felt uneasy again. They went to Yuan Qiaohua several times early in the morning and repeatedly urged her, "Don't say it at the conference!" "If you say it, I'll expose you first!" Qiaohua's thinking was already clear, so she deliberately said, "Heavens! How can we explain this? Why don't we mobilize everyone and expose our thoughts!" In this way, one connecting three, and three connecting ten, the women and men of the entire Second Street were connected in a large area. When the cadres of the Fourth Street met, they promoted the experience of the Second Street.
    Then, ideological turnaround conferences were held in the people's schools of each street to "tell the truth." The mobilization slogan was "Expose thoughts, cure heart troubles!" "Strive to be an ideological turnaround model!" They also established a "Ledger of Meritorious Service for the People." Political Director Cheng Yufang, activist Yuan Qiaohua, and others all spoke about their backward thoughts. The more thoroughly a person exposed their thoughts, the more welcome they were. Before this person finished speaking, that person stood up and started speaking. Middle peasant Zhang Huan said, "I'm satisfied with everything, but I'm not satisfied with the struggle against Zhang Wenchang. Last year, when we were expanding the army, Zhang Wenchang wanted to join the army, but the village didn't let him go and even struggled against him!" ... After most people had exposed their thoughts, the cadres and activists guided everyone to analyze the class again from specific people and specific events. Zhang Huan thought it through. It turned out that in terms of class background, Zhang Wenchang was a middle peasant, but in terms of character, he was a special agent who helped the landlord persecute the masses. He was a "black sheep" among the middle peasant households and should be "kicked away." Since Zhang Hong's mother exposed her thoughts and recognized that the middle peasants were the basic masses and belonged to the same class as the poor and hired peasants, she took a long breath and said, "This heart trouble of mine can be considered cured!" The people's school in the Fourth Street, in the process of exposing thoughts and curing heart troubles, further clarified the reasons why the fruits of struggle such as clothes and furniture could not be distributed. Middle peasant Cheng Xianwen said, "Our original intention was not to want those miscellaneous things, but we were afraid of being said to be backward and being struggled against, so we actively made suggestions, and the more we made suggestions, the more there were!" Some poor people were given estates, but why didn't they move in to live in them now? Why were they more attached to a few acres of bad land than to good land? This was also clarified in this process. Anti-Japanese dependents Zhang Er and Zhang Zhengjie did not move into the landlord's estate, but scrambled to live in the estate of Fu Ruoxin (also an anti-Japanese dependent who moved into the landlord Cheng Feng's house), because they were "afraid that others would come over and not be able to handle it themselves!" As a result of exposing thoughts and curing heart troubles, even the peasant Chen Qiuyu, who used to "feel his way around," stood up and said, "I used to burn incense, but I still suffered. I suffered from the loss of not awakening my thoughts!"
    Then, in the winter school, they studied, are there still people in our peasants who have not turned over their thinking? Everyone said, "Yes!" They then put forward the names of some old men, old women, hired laborers, and maids, and automatically connected them to expose their thoughts and cure their heart troubles, so that they could turn over completely in their thinking. In this process, there were seven or eight "air-raid shelter" problems. Some of the masses did not understand and hated them, and wanted to let them wear glasses and tall hats in the winter school to vent their anger. At this time, the leadership guided everyone to re-divide the classes and recognize that "They are all our poor brothers, eating their food and serving them! The old society forced them to do this!" They also unanimously passed a resolution saying, "From now on, we will never call them 'running dogs.' The landlords call us poor people 'dogs that can't be fed enough'!" The woman Wang Caizhu's family had preserved a quilt belonging to the landlord Zhang Laokong, who was her husband's relative. She had wanted to take it out a long time ago, but her family opposed, saying, "If you're not afraid of trouble, then take it out!" So she put it away again. After this study and analysis, she bravely took it out. Yang Lugui, who was eighty years old, and Cheng Yongliang, who was almost ninety years old, and a group of old peasants, in the process of exposing their thoughts and curing their heart troubles, also unearthed the landlords' silver dollars and valuables. On March 9th, the Ren Village masses, after deliberating and analyzing in the people's school, concluded that the landlords in Zhangjiagou Natural Village had not yet been "kicked away." The next day, after eating breakfast, men, women, and children, in groups of twos and threes, went to connect with the poor brothers in Zhangjiagou and unearthed eighteen more large bundles.

　　思想复查
    任村群众露思想去心病
    展潮
    自阳历二月底至三月中旬，任村的土地改革处在深入复查阶段。它的特点是群众性的，在思想自觉的基础上开展起来的复查运动。
    旧历年后，任村深入运动中，一方面发现特务正设法组织反攻，农民内部还有少数地主的“防空洞”，衣服家具等斗争果实，分配了十来二十天，调来换去，一直还有意见；另一方面干部积极分子疲劳自满情绪开始滋长。正在这个时候，全林县提出了深入复查。区村干部积极分子领导集团便开会讨论：复查是为了把地主彻底斗透，不留一点封建尾巴，咱们穷人翻透身！但是怎个才算斗透翻透身呢？地主扫地出门算不算斗透？咱老实农民敢起来说话闹斗争算不算翻透身？有人说：“算！”有人说：“不算！”领导上便引导大家分析前一段运动、研究当前存在的问题：为啥特务钻空子，为啥还有“防空洞”，为啥斗争果实一直填补不好？最后一致认识到“咱任村可还没有透哩！”“思想不翻身可不办事！”积极分子打通了思想，便到群众中广泛酝酿讨论这件事，这时候又提出了个新问题：“怎个思想翻身法？”干部说：“咱都先说说在斗争里头有些啥想法？觉得那里不合适？……说老实话！”可是到民校里谁都不说。领导上研究结果，原来前一时期，特务看到群众对填补衣服家具等斗争果实有意见，鼓动群众撤换二街农会主席，说农会主席洗脸擦黑是假的，这回又贪污了一件金字布衫、两缸粮食。后经群众在学校里讨论，证明是特务捏造，特务魏先德只好当众坦白“说老实话”。自此以后，大家都怕提“说老实话”，这是横在群众思想翻身面前的一块大绊脚石。
    二街依靠积极分子串通，首先打破了这一关。当时公安干事石杨先在二街帮助工作，和几个积极分子闲扯，他问袁巧花：“你自破房搬进好庄，有啥想法？”“心里总觉得不大一样吧？”慢慢、慢慢把巧花的话头引开，她说：“也不知是迷信，还是怎回事？这回填平补齐俺家分了一条毡一条盖的，恰恰俺婆婆身上就生了个疮！”“这几年不敬神也没啥糊涂，这次填平补齐俺婆身上长了个疮，心里就咯痒痒的，也不知是害地主怕还是为啥？！……”老石听了就鼓励她一顿说：“你在运动里一直是积极分子，这回思想翻身复查运动，该当个思想模范，用老实话去串通人。”巧花答应了，她先找几个对心事的娘们，一边作活一边闲扯说：“咱有啥说啥！”便把她自从填补毡婆婆身上生疮的心思话细说了一番，还说：“不知怎鬼捣的，还想到灶爷跟前烧柱香，又怕旁人瞧见了！”那几个妇女说：“哎哟！巧花你都先说开这啦！俺心里可早就咯生生的！可是咱都是姊妹们闲扯，不要到大会上说啊！”镇公所书记张宏他娘说：“巧花，人家诉苦，俺可得给你诉诉冤，那年王子学（特务）当镇长，叫群众斗争了。苏英豪（恶霸特务地主）当书记，又成了特务。俺孩接上他的手，俺心里咯颤颤的，心想这回可轮到咱了。俺宏说人挨斗争的是特务地主，绝对轮不上咱，心想俺宏说宽心话。又怕工作不积极挨斗争，就跟俺宏说过账要弄得清清格格、手续可要点滴交代好。看见俺宏回来又说又笑，心里就痛快，看见回来少言少语，就愁伤了，心想快挨斗争啦。过去成人家省吃俭用，自那以后心想吃一天算一天。每次听说斗争，心里就咯缩缩！……”彭福山媳妇说，深入运动她也参加斗争要东西了，总是看不得打人，自己站在前面是怕说落后。很多妇女说完心思话，又觉得放心不下，一清早去找袁巧花几回，千嘱咐万嘱咐说：“好歹不要在大会上说啊！”“你要说，俺就先露你！”袁巧花思想已经通了，故意说：“天老爷啊！怎个解释呢？咱不如把大家都发动起来，都露开思想吧！”这样一个串连三、三个串连十，全二街妇女男人串连了一大片。四道街干部一碰头，又把二街的经验推广开了。
    接着各街民校开说老实话思想翻身大会。动员的口号是“露思想，去心病”！“争取思想翻身模范！”又都立了本“为民立功账”，政治主任程毓芳积极分子袁巧花等都说了自己的落后思想。思想愈是露得彻底的人愈受大家欢迎，这个人还没说完，那个就站起来说开了。中农张焕的说：“我啥也满意，就是斗争张文昌不满意，去年扩兵，张文昌要去参军，村上不叫去，还斗争了一顿！”……等到大多数人把思想都露完，干部积极分子便引导大家从具体人、具体事，再分析阶级。张焕的想通了，原来论成份张文昌是个中农，论为人他是个特务，帮助地主迫害群众。是中农户里面的“害群马”，该“蹬展”他。张宏他娘自从露开思想，认清中农是基本群众，跟贫雇农是一个阶级里人，便长长的透了一口气说：“俺这块心病可算去啦！”四街民校更从露思想去心病过程中，澄清了衣服家具等果实分不下去的原因。中农程现文说：“咱本心是不想要那些杂七杂八的东西了，却怕说落后挨斗争，便积极提意见，越提越多！”有些贫苦人分了庄子，为啥当下不搬进去住？填了好地为啥不如几亩歹地亲？在这个过程中也澄清了。抗属张二、张正杰不搬到地主庄里住，却抢着要住傅若心（也是抗属，搬到地主程丰家里去了）家的庄子，原因是“怕人家过来不行自己！”经过露思想，去心病的结果，连过去在“摸口道”的农民陈秋雨也起来了，他说：“俺过去烧香是烧香，受罪还是受罪，背了思想不觉悟的亏了呀！”
    接着又在冬学里研究，咱农民里面还有思想没翻身的人没有？都说“有啊！”便提出些老汉、老婆、羊工和使女的名字，自动串连他们露思想、去心病，从思想上翻透身。在这当中，夹着七八户“防空洞”问题，有一部分群众思想不通，仇恨他们，要叫他们在冬学里画眼镜戴高帽出气，这时领导上便引导大家再划分阶级，认识到“都是咱穷弟兄啊，吃人家一碗饭、服人家使换！旧社会逼迫他们这样做！”还一致通过说：“咱从今往后绝不叫他们‘走狗’，地主才叫咱们穷人‘喂不饱的狗’呢！”妇女王彩竹家里保存她男人本家地主张老空的一床被子，早就想拿出来了，家里人反对说：“不怕不碍事你就拿吧！”便又放起来了，经过这次研究分析，才勇敢地拿出来了。八十岁的杨禄桂，快九十岁的程永亮一帮老农民，都在露思想去心病中，又澄出地主的现洋内货。三月九日，任村群众在民校酝酿分析结果，张家沟自然村地主还没有“蹬展”，第二天吃罢早起饭，男女老少三个两个一伙，去串连张家沟的穷弟兄去了，又澄出了十八个大包袱。
