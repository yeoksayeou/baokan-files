From the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Front, 13th: During the counter-sweep in Southern Hebei in late March, our military and civilians annihilated over sixty enemies. On the 22nd, the 68th Division of Heze, colluding with local bandits, numbering about five hundred, launched a joint attack on the stationed areas of our working teams in the Ganyuan and Pingling districts. Our working teams bravely resisted, engaging in fierce battle for two hours, killing and capturing over ten enemies. On the 24th, a unit of our local armed forces, in order to effectively smash the enemy's "sweep," maneuvered to the enemy's rear, ambushing a contingent of enemies in Dongming. After two hours of fierce fighting, five enemies were killed or captured, and some weapons were seized. The enemy fled in disarray towards Dongming city. On the 26th, the main force of the enemy in Dongming, a regiment, in coordination with stubborn elements, carrying three small cannons and two vehicles, continued to carry out a "sweep" in the central area of Southern Hebei in three routes. Our army kept fiercely attacking the enemy, who then retreated in panic. We killed, wounded, and captured a total of over forty enemies, seized over forty rifles and two machine guns. We suffered no casualties.
