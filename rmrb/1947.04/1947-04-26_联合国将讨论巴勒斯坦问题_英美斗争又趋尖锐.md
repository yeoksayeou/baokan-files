　　UN to Discuss Palestine Issue
    Anglo-American Struggle Intensifies Again
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, April 23rd] On the eve of the United Nations special session to be held on April 28 to discuss the Palestine issue, the Anglo-American struggle in the area has intensified again. According to a report by the Associated Press: Four British military camps in Palestine were suddenly bombed, and eight sections of power lines were cut along the 300-mile Palestinian coast. It is believed that this is a comprehensive underground disturbance launched by the Jews, with the aim of influencing the United Nations' consideration of the Palestine issue. It is reported that Palestinian Jews, with the support of the United States, have previously attacked British military camps several times with American weapons. British Foreign Secretary Bevin revealed in February Truman's attempt to move 100,000 Jews into Palestine, stating roughly: The United States supports the Jews, intending to subvert the British mandate over Palestine.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, April 24th] According to a report from Lac Success by Agence France-Presse: Following Egypt and Syria, the governments of Libya and Iraq have requested the United Nations Secretary-General to include the termination of the British mandate over Palestine and the issue of Palestinian independence on the agenda of the United Nations General Assembly special session.

　　联合国将讨论巴勒斯坦问题
    英美斗争又趋尖锐
    【新华社陕北二十三日电】在联合国行将于本月二十八日特别会议讨论巴勒斯坦问题的前夕，英美在该地的斗争又趋尖锐化。据合众社报导：巴勒斯坦英国军营四所突然被炸，沿巴勒斯坦海峡三百英里有八处电线被切断。佥信此为犹太人所发动之全面性地下骚动，其目的在影响联合国对巴勒斯坦问题之考虑。按巴勒斯坦犹太人在美国支持下，前次曾数度以美国武器攻击英军营，英外相贝文曾于二月间揭露杜鲁门要求将十万犹太人移入巴勒斯坦的企图，略谓：美国支持犹太人，意图颠覆英国对巴勒斯坦的委任统治。
    【新华社陕北二十四日电】据法国新闻社成功湖讯：继埃及与叙利亚之后，利比亚与伊拉克政府要求联合国秘书长将结束英国对巴勒斯坦委任统治与巴勒斯坦独立问题列入联合国大会特别会议议事日程中。
