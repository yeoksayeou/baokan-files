　　Wuxiang New and Old Districts
    Continue to Implement Land Reform
    [Report from this newspaper] Wuxiang Extended Cadre Meeting Supplementary Report: The Extended Cadre Meeting held in Wuxiang in the latter half of last month used Neiyi Village (old district) as an example to examine the mass mobilization situation. Of the 146 men in the entire village, 97 were mobilized, 18 followed along, and 31 were lagging behind. Of the 119 women, 34 were mobilized, 52 kept up, and 33 were afraid to struggle. The reasons for this were analyzed as follows: First, in the past, the leadership was only satisfied with the victory of political struggle and did not pay attention to the masses' economic interests. Because the political struggle between the masses of Wuxiang and the landlords was particularly sharp historically, after the cadres and activists won the political struggle, they thought the situation was opened up and the economic interests would be easily resolved, so the leadership quickly changed course; but the landlords took the opportunity to counterattack and did not give the peasants the fruits they deserved, so some people thought that they could not get any benefits from the struggle and were not active in the struggle. Second, during the rent reduction period, the distribution of fruits was centered on problems, and some of the poorest farmers did not get any benefits, and no attention was paid to mobilizing them. Third, because the cadres were not sufficiently reformed in the movement, there were unfair phenomena in assigning tasks, which made some of the masses dissatisfied with the cadres. In addition, the administrative orders of the cadres in their work also hit some people, and they became estranged from the cadres and fell behind. The key to mobilizing the "backward" is first to solve their relationship with the cadres, enlighten the cadres to consciously apologize to the masses, and have the masses discuss the merits of the cadres, enlightening the masses to realize that the cadres and they are one family, and the problem can be well solved. Bai Junru, a village cadre in Hanbi Village, Second District, had a bad style, and the masses were very opposed to him and wanted to overthrow him; but when the masses talked about his merits, they remembered that in 1938, when fighting the big landlord Wei Xiaoshan, no one dared to fight, and Bai Junru was the first to lead us to victory in the struggle. Therefore, the masses understood that Bai Junru and they were one family, so after Bai reflected to the masses and was willing to change his style, the masses supported him. From then on, more than 90% of the peasants were united and turned to the landlord Wei Xiaoshan to carry out a major struggle to vent grievances and settle accounts. Secondly, from the perspective of land relations, it is not thorough. In Majiazhuang, Chengguan (new district) and other villages in the Fifth District, the average yield per landlord is now 6.3 shi; the average yield per poor peasant is only 2.5 shi, and the landlords are still attacking the peasants. The landlords of Moyu Village in the Second District organized to overthrow our political director. Therefore, this meeting has decided to continue to implement it and must do a good job in land reform. (Li Fang, Bu Ao)

　　武乡新老区
    继续贯彻土地改革
    【本报讯】武乡扩干会补充报导：武乡于上月下旬所召开之扩干会，曾以内义村（老区）为例，检查了群众发动情形，全村一百四十六个男人中，发动起来的九十七人，跟着跑的十八人，落后的卅一人，一百十九个女人中，发动起来的卅四人，跟上走的五十二人，不敢斗争的还有卅三人。分折原因：第一是领导上过去只满足于政治斗争的胜利，不注意群众的经济利益。由于历史上武乡群众与地主的政治斗争特别尖锐，干部积极分子在政治斗争胜利以后，就认为打开局面了，经济利益容易解决了，领导上就很快转弯；但地主却乘隙反攻，不给农民应得的果实，因此有些人认为斗争也得不到利，不积极斗争。第二是减租时期分果实以问题为中心，一部赤贫农没有得到利益，也没注意发动他们。第三是由于干部在运动中改造不够，有派差不公等现象，使一部群众对干部不满。此外干部工作上的行政命令，亦打击了一部分人，他们和干部有了隔阂而落后起来。发动“落后”的关键首先是解决他们与干部关系，启发干部自觉向群众道歉，群众讨论干部功劳，启发群众认识干部和他们是一家人，问题就能很好解决。二区韩壁村村干部白俊如因作风不好，群众非常反对，要斗倒他；但当群众谈论他的功劳时，想起三八年斗争大地主魏筱山，谁也不敢斗，头一炮就是白俊如领导咱们斗争胜利的。因此群众明白了白俊如和他们是一家人，所以在白向群众反省并愿转变自己作风后，群众便拥护他。从此便团结了百分之九十以上的农民，转向地主魏筱山，进行了总诉苦总算账的大斗争。其次从土地关系上看，也不彻底。五区马家庄、城关（新区）等村，现在地主每人平均产量六·三石；贫农仅平均产量二·五石，地主还仍然向农民进攻。二区陌峪村地主组织打倒我们政治主任。因而此次会议已决定继续贯彻，一定要把土地改革做好。（李芳、步鳌）
