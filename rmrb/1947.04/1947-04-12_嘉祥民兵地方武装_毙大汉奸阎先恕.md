　　Jiaxiang Militia Local Armed Forces
    Eliminate Arch-Traitor Yan Xianshu
    [Our newspaper, Ji-Lu-Yu, 9th dispatch] The Jiaxiang militia, in coordination with local armed forces, killed Yan Xianshu, the "剿匪" Commander [bandit suppression commander] of the Jiang regime's Jin, Jia, and Ji counties. At 12:00 pm on March 9th, our Jiaxiang militia and a certain unit of the local armed forces attacked the troops of the local arch-traitor Yan Xianshu (formerly the Third Security Brigade, now renamed the Self-Defense General Team) in Shuangfeng Village, eight miles southwest of Jiaxiang city. After a 20-minute battle, Yan Xianshu, his adjutant Mu Heng, and 45 other officers and soldiers below the rank of battalion commander were killed. 27 officers and soldiers were captured alive. 7 warhorses, 53 long and short guns, 1,500 rounds of ammunition, over 10,000 catties of wheat, and a portion of other military supplies were seized. Only three people were slightly injured. Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, Yan was the head of the Red Cross for many years. During the War of Resistance, he surrendered to the Japanese invaders and was later incorporated into the Jiang regime's Security Brigade. He also served as the "剿匪" commander of Jin, Jia, and Ji counties. During the last Jiang army's northern invasion, he buried 67 farmers in Jiaxiang alive. Only three or four days after his return this time, he killed another 20 honest farmers. Young women in the villages he occupied were all raped. He also formed a bloody reactionary rule with local special agents and landlords. The people hated him to the bone. This time, our militia and local armed forces eliminated this great scourge for the people of Jiaxiang. The masses in the whole county were all overjoyed and ecstatic.
    [Our newspaper, Ji-Lu-Yu, 9th dispatch] The Ji-Lu-Yu Armed Forces General Explosives Training Class, after many tests and exercises, set off for the front line on a certain day. When they departed, the masses in the驻地 cheered and sent them off with drums and music, and gave a message saying: "We hope the heroes will destroy more of the Jiang army's cars and trains. The common people have prepared their strength to support you." The team members all expressed that they would definitely meet the people's demands.
    [Another dispatch] Changqing and Taixi militias launch landmine warfare. On the 13th of last month, the Changqing militia, led by Wen Dongtong, laid three landmines north of the Pingfang home. The next day, the Jiang army stepped on all of them, killing eight people and fleeing back in panic. On the 16th, the militia of the first district of Taixi laid a landmine at the Zhanghou River estuary on the north bank of the Wen River, killing another enemy soldier.

　　嘉祥民兵地方武装
    毙大汉奸阎先恕
    【本报冀鲁豫九日电】喜祥民兵配合地方武装击毙蒋记金、嘉、济三县“剿匪”司令阎先恕。三月九日晚十二时我嘉祥民兵及地方武装某部在嘉祥城西南八里地双风村袭击当地大汉奸阎先恕部（原第三保安旅现改为自卫总队），经二十分钟战斗，击毙阎先恕及副官长牟恒及营长以下四十五名，生俘官兵二十七名，缴战马七匹，长短枪五十三支，子弹一千五百发，麦子万余斤，及其他军用品一部。仅轻伤三人。阎伪抗战前曾充红会头子多年，抗战时投降日寇，后编为蒋记保安旅，又任金、嘉、济三县“剿匪”司令。上次蒋军北犯时，彼即活埋我嘉祥农民六十七人，此次回窜仅三四天又杀老实农民二十人。彼所占村庄青年妇女悉被强奸，且与当地特务地主结成血腥反动统治，人民恨之入骨。此次我民兵及地方武装为嘉祥人民除此大害，全县群众莫不欢欣鼓舞高兴若狂。
    【本报冀鲁豫九日电】冀鲁豫武总爆炸训练班经多次试验与演习后，已于某日开赴前线。临行时驻地群众鼓乐欢送，并赠言说：“望英雄们多多炸毁蒋军汽车和火车，老百姓已经准备好力量支援你们。”队员们均表示一定答复群众要求。
    【又讯】长清、泰西民兵展开地雷战。上月十三日长清民兵由文东同率领在平坊家北埋设三个地雷，第二天蒋军全部踏响炸死八名后惊慌窜回。十六日泰西一区民兵在汶河北岸张候河口埋设一地雷，又炸死敌一名。
