Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 28th: Chen Granny, a farmer over fifty years old from the suburbs of Huai'an in the Kuomintang-controlled area of Central China, was awarded the honorary title of "Model Woman" for sacrificing her son and destroying her house to help guerrilla fighters escape danger. On the 7th of this month, seven New Fourth Army plainclothes guerrillas and three armed messengers were operating in the suburbs of Huai'an. At night, they rested at Chen Granny's house. The next day, at dawn, gunshots rang out. Chen Granny quickly got up and opened the door, seeing that over a hundred Kuomintang soldiers from Shintang had occupied the high ground outside the village and were dividing into groups to search the village. The guerrillas had no way to break through. Chen Granny, in a moment of quick thinking, set fire to her own thatched cottage and called the guerrillas to the roof to put out the fire. At this time, the Kuomintang soldiers arrived and pointed their guns at Chen Granny: "Damn it, don't move! Quickly tell us who is the New Fourth Army!" Chen Granny just shouted frantically, "Fire! Fire!" The Kuomintang soldiers grabbed her son and dragged him behind the house, raising their guns to kill him. Her son shouted anxiously, "Mom, hurry up and say it! I'm not the New Fourth Army, I'm your own son!" If Chen Granny had agreed, she might have saved her son's life, but she feared that the Kuomintang soldiers would suspect that she had too many sons, so she pointed to two guerrillas who had not yet reached the roof and said, "Good sirs, they are not the New Fourth Army. This one is my eldest son, and that one is my brother. Those on the roof are neighbors who are helping me put out the fire." After saying this, she told them to quickly get on the roof to put out the fire. The Kuomintang soldiers rushed to search other villages, and the ten guerrilla fighters all escaped danger, but her own son was shot dead by the Kuomintang soldiers. Afterwards, neighbors came to express their condolences. Chen Granny did not complain at all, and said to everyone with tears in her eyes, "The New Fourth Army will not leave, and the New Fourth Army will not forget us!" The Huai'an County Democratic Government has now invited Chen Granny to move to the central area to settle down, and has awarded her a major merit and the honorary title of "Model Woman".

　　淮安模范妇女陈奶奶
    舍子毁屋掩护游击队
    【新华社华中廿八日电】华中蒋军后方淮安城郊五十余岁老农妇陈奶奶，舍子毁屋掩护游击队员脱险，荣获“模范妇女”光荣称号。本月七日，七个新四军便衣游击队员和三个武装交通员，在淮安城郊活动，入晚，于陈奶奶家休息，次日微明枪声四起，陈奶奶急起开门，见从石塘前来的百余蒋军已占领村外高地，正分路进庄搜索。游击队员已无法突围，陈奶奶急中生智，用火燃着自己茅屋叫游击队员上房救火，这时蒋军已赶到，枪口对准陈奶奶：“妈的，不准动，快说那一个是新四军！”陈奶奶只是狂呼“救火救火”！蒋军一把抓住他儿子拖往屋后，举枪欲杀，儿子急呼“妈，赶快说呀！我不是新四军，我是你亲生儿子呀！”陈奶奶如答应一声或能救了儿子性命，但她怕蒋军疑其儿子太多，乃指着两个未及上屋的游击队员说：“好先生，他们不是新四军，这个是我的大儿子，那个是我的兄弟，房上是邻居，都是帮我来救火的。”说毕又叫他们快上房救火，蒋军急往别庄搜索，十个游击战士于是全告脱险，但她亲生儿子却被蒋军枪杀了。事后邻居纷来慰问，陈奶奶毫无怨言，含泪向大家说：“新四军是不会走的，新四军是不可能忘记我们的！”淮安县民主政府现已请陈奶奶迁至中心区安家，并记大功一次，赠予“模范妇女”光荣称号。
