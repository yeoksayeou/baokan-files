    Celebrating the Great Victory on the Southern Shanxi Front
    To defend the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and to coordinate with the operations in northern Shaanxi, our Taiyue troops, from the 4th to the 10th of this month, in seven days, advanced into the Fenhe River Plain with the speed of a thunderbolt, successively capturing eight cities: Xin'an, Jishan, Hejin, Yicheng, Fushan, Qi County, Ronghe, and Wanquan, controlling over a hundred miles of the Tongpu Railway, and seizing the throat of Qin and Jin, the Yumenkou. Nearly 7,000 Chiang's troops were annihilated. This great victory demonstrates that our army has begun to grasp the initiative on the southern Shanxi battlefield, and the war situation in southern Shanxi is gradually changing. The connection between the major strongholds of Chiang's army—Linfen, Quwo, and Yuncheng—has been cut off, leaving them in a state of isolation. The vast countryside and towns have been and are being liberated from the tyranny of Chiang and Yan. This victory powerfully coordinated with the operations in northern Shaanxi, putting Hu Zongnan in an even more embarrassing situation of being unable to advance or retreat. Our frontline soldiers have made great contributions to defending Chairman Mao, which is worthy of our warm celebration.
    In the midst of warmly celebrating the victory, in order to continue our efforts, expand the results of the battle, and make even greater contributions to defending Chairman Mao, we hope that:
    Compatriots in the newly recovered areas, you have suffered all the pain in the world under the dark rule of Chiang and Yan's army, with your land confiscated, your property looted, and your able-bodied men conscripted; now that you are liberated, in order to get rid of the past miserable life, you should quickly take action to destroy Chiang and Yan's "soldier-peasant unity" village compilation system and Baojia system, and establish a people's regime, especially to defeat the cannibalistic system of "land village common ownership," so that the land can be returned to the peasants and become the private property of the peasants, and a fair and reasonable distribution can be carried out, so that landless and land-poor peasants can obtain land, so as to achieve the realization of tilling their own land. Now is the time for you to stand up, to demand the blood debt from the war criminals and traitors who have committed heinous crimes; seize the opportunity to rise up and fight for your complete liberation. Our cadres in the newly recovered areas should be loyal and lead the masses to realize the above tasks, and launch a campaign to serve the people and make meritorious deeds.
    Soldiers of Chiang and Yan's army and those who are attached to the diehards, your officers boast to you every day about "victory," but what are the facts now? When the People's Liberation Army arrives, they show a miserable appearance, collapsing at the mere sight of the enemy, which is exactly the opposite of what they say. If they run a little slower, they will be captured alive. Wasn't Wang Shuchen, the deputy brigade commander of the 27th Brigade, captured? You should have a clearer understanding of the invincible power of the People's Liberation Army and its just cause for independence, peace, and democracy! There is no way out for you to follow Chiang Kai-shek, only self-destruction. As the saying goes, "Lay down the butcher's knife and become a Buddha on the spot"; we hope you will quickly change your evil ways and return with your guns! We welcome you and treat you kindly.
    Compatriots in the liberated areas, because of your heroic support for the front line, you have won a great victory, and you have made a great contribution to Chairman Mao. In the future, you should still combine supporting the front line with production and emancipation, and actively participate in stretcher carrying, rescue, guiding, and other work, and eliminate the phenomenon of evading labor service. County and district cadres should participate directly to consolidate the morale of the masses participating in the war. Mutual aid groups and people engaged in production at home should take care of the production of those who support the front line and take care of the production of military families, so that the frontline soldiers and the masses participating in the war can concentrate on fighting and war support work, strive for greater victories, and defend our fruits of emancipation and our happy democratic life.
    Brave soldiers on the front line, this great victory further shows that you have become an ever-victorious army that is invincible and can overcome all obstacles! You have once again written a glorious page for the patriotic self-defense war! The compatriots on the front line are treating you as "heavenly soldiers" and welcoming you warmly; the people in the rear are even more excited and are rising up to support you unremittingly. We hope that you will not be arrogant or slack, but will continue your efforts, continue to expand the results of the battle, eliminate more of Chiang and Hu's troops, and make more contributions to defending Chairman Mao!

　　庆祝晋南前线大捷
    太岳新华日报社论
    为保卫党中央，保卫毛主席，配合陕北作战，太岳我军从本月四日起至十日七天中，以迅雷不及掩耳之势，挺进汾西平原，连下新＠、稷山、河津、翼城、浮山、＠县、荣河、万泉等八城，控制同蒲路百余里，并握住秦晋的咽喉禹门口，歼灭蒋军近七千人，这一伟大的胜利，说明我军已开始掌握了晋南战场的主动权，晋南的战争形势正在逐步改变着。蒋军的大据点——临汾、曲沃、运城之间的连系，已被切断，陷于孤立状态。广大的乡村与城镇，已经并正在从蒋阎的暴政下解放出来。这一胜利，有力的配合了陕北的作战，使胡宗南更加陷于欲进不能、欲退不得的狼狈境地。我前线健儿已为保卫毛主席而立了大功，这是值得我们热烈庆祝的。
    在热烈庆祝胜利声中，为再接再厉、扩张战果，为保卫毛主席立更大的功劳，我们希望：
    新收复区的同胞，你们在蒋阎军黑暗统治下，土地被没收，财产被抢光，壮丁被抽完，真是尝尽了人间的痛苦；现在你们被解放了，为摆脱过去苦难的生活，应迅速行动起来，摧毁蒋阎“兵农合一”的编村制、保甲制，建立起人民的政权，尤其要打垮“土地村公有”的吃人制度，使土地归还农民，变为农民的私有财产，并进行公平合理的分配，使无地少地的农民都获得土地，以达到耕者有其田的实现。现在是你们翻身的时候了，是你们向罪大恶极的战争罪犯奸逆头子索回血债的时候了；要不失时机的起来为自己的彻底解放而斗争。我新收复区的干部，则应忠心耿耿，为领导群众实现上述任务，展开一个为民立功运动。
    蒋阎军的士兵与附顽的人员们，你们的长官天天向你们吹嘘“胜利”，可是现在的事实怎样呢？人民解放军一到，他们便表现出狼狈不堪，望风披靡，恰与他们所说的相反。他们跑得稍慢一些，就被生擒活捉。二十七旅的副旅长王树忱等不都当了俘虏吗？你们对人民解放军无敌的力量，及其为独立和平民主的正义而战，该已认识得更清楚了吧！你们跟着蒋介石走是没出路的，只能是自取灭亡。语云：“放下屠刀，立地成佛”；望你们赶快改邪归正，携枪来归吧！我们欢迎你们，优待你们。
    解放区的同胞们，由于你们英勇支援前线，打了胜仗，你们已为毛主席立了大功，今后仍应将支援前线与生产、翻身结合起来，踊跃参加担架、救护、引路等工作，消灭某些逃避支差的现象。县区干部应直接参加，以巩固参战群众情绪。各地互助组及在家生产的人们，应照顾支援前线者的生产，照顾军属的生产，使前线战士与参战群众安心打仗与战勤工作，争取更大的胜利，保卫我们的翻身果实，保卫我们民主的幸福生活。
    前线英勇的将士们，从这次伟大的胜利中，更显示你们已成为战无不胜、攻无不克的常胜军，你们再次为爱国自卫战争写下了光辉的一页！前线的同胞正将你们奉为“天兵”而热忱的欢迎；后方的人民更兴奋若狂，并一致奋起为支援你们而不懈的努力，望你们勿骄勿懈，再接再厉，继续扩张战果，消灭更多的蒋胡军，为保卫毛主席而功上加功！
