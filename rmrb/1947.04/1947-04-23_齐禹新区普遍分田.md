    【Report from Ji-Lu-Yu, April 21st】The western new district of Qi-Yu (new county) is carrying out a land distribution campaign, opening up the situation in more than 250 villages in 20 days. After defeating the traitor Li Lianxiang in February of this year, the 250-plus villages in the western part of the county were liberated. This area, having been under the rule of puppet and die-hard elements for many years, saw that each village had pro-enemy landlords and despots who tried every possible means to threaten and suppress the peasants. For a time, the peasants dared not approach us and dared not pour out the grievances in their hearts. Understanding this situation, the district, starting from March 6th, on the one hand detained the bad eggs who hindered the masses from turning over, and on the other hand, held joint conferences of middle and poor peasants by district to carry out grievance-airing and turn-over education, and handled several extremely sinful elements at the conferences. The masses' emotions rose, and when they returned to their villages, they arrested all the bad eggs who had slipped through the net. Middle and poor peasants in each village successively established their own organizations to strengthen their vigilance against the landlords. The Fifth District is a marginal area. When land reform began, the masses first established militia to defend themselves and protect their land. During the land reform, the masses distributed land and stood guard to maintain order, repelling more than a dozen night attacks by armed special agents, thus stabilizing the masses' emotions. Currently, eight villages including Baimazhuang have recovered 532 mu of land, and more than 200 extremely poor households have land to cultivate.

    齐禹新区普遍分田
    【本报冀鲁豫二十一日电】齐禹（新县）西部新区，开展分田运动，廿天中打开二百五十余村局面。在今年二月打垮汉奸李连祥后，该县西部二百五十余村得到解放，这块地区由于受伪顽统治多年，各村均有通敌的地主恶霸，千方百计的威胁镇压农民，农民一时不敢接近我们，满肚子的苦水也不敢倒。区里了解了这个情况，从三月六日起，一方面扣押妨碍群众翻身的坏蛋，一方面分区召开中贫农联合大会，进行诉苦翻身教育，并在大会上处理了几个罪大恶极的分子。群众情绪高了，回到村里把漏网的坏蛋全部扣起来。各村中贫农纷纷成立自己的组织，加强对地主的戒备。五区是边缘区，在开始进行土地改革时，群众首先成立了民兵，自卫保田，在土地改革进行中，群众一面分田，一面站岗戒严，曾打退武装特务十几次夜袭，稳定了群众的情绪。现白马庄等八个庄已收回土地五百三十二亩，二百多户赤贫有了地种。
