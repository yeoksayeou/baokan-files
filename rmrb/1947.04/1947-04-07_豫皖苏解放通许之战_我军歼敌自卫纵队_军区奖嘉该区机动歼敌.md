　　Report from the Yu-Wan-Su Front, May 5th: In the battle to liberate Tongxu last month on the 30th, our Yu-Wan-Su troops annihilated the city's self-defense column (i.e., the security regiment), a company of new recruits from the 47th Division, and a portion of the Xuchang Prefectural Commissioner's Office's emergency training team. A total of 230 people were captured, including the deputy commander of the self-defense column, Han Wenyun. The captured weaponry included four machine guns, 303 rifles and carbines, nine pistols, one submachine gun, two grenade launchers, and one radio. The Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Military Region specially commended the Su-Wan troops for their mobile annihilation of the enemy.

　　Report from the Yu-Wan-Su Front, May 6th: Our Yu-Wan-Su troops are continuing their heroic struggle against the "encirclement and suppression." Since the victory against "encirclement and suppression" last month in the area, the Kuomintang's Sixth Pacification Zone Director Zhou Yan has unified the command of the 58th Division's 64th Brigade, the Second Traffic Police Corps, the remnants of Zhang Lanfeng's 17th Corps, and various local militias to once again conduct "encirclement and suppression" against our Yu-Wan-Su area. In addition to recovering important towns such as Zhoujiakou on the 23rd, Taikang on the 27th, and Tongxu on the 30th of last month, the heroic Yu-Wan-Su military and civilians, who are resisting "encirclement and suppression," also defeated the attack of more than 300 soldiers from the 30th Regiment of the enemy's New Fourth Brigade at Huoshendian, northeast of Yongcheng, on the 15th of last month, killing or capturing more than 30 enemy soldiers and seizing one machine gun and more than 30 rifles. On the 18th, our troops counterattacked the 64th Brigade and the 17th Traffic Police Corps, which were advancing in three directions, at Xiaoguozhuang, northwest of Taikang, killing or wounding more than 250 enemy soldiers and capturing more than 20. Two machine guns and eleven carbines were seized. On the 23rd, a unit of our troops attacked Huaiyang from the north, killing or wounding more than ten enemy soldiers and capturing 24. They also annihilated most of a battalion of the Huaiyang Security Regiment, which was entrenched at Liji in Huaiyang, capturing more than 60 people and seizing two machine guns and more than 50 rifles. On the same afternoon, the 64th Brigade of the Chiang Kai-shek's army in Taikang launched another attack on us, but was counterattacked by our troops, who recovered seven villages occupied by Chiang's troops, killing or wounding more than 60 Chiang's soldiers, capturing more than 100, and seizing seven light and heavy machine guns, two mortars, and 15,000 rounds of ammunition. Our troops are now expanding their gains.
