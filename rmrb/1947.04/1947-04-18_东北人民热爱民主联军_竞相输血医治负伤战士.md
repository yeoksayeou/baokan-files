　　Northeastern People Love the Democratic Allied Army
    Competing to Donate Blood to Treat Wounded Soldiers
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 7th] A voluntary blood donation team in a rear hospital, since its establishment in October last year, has expanded to more than 900 people in four months, donating a total of 140,000 "CC" of blood, enabling more than 200 wounded soldiers to return to the front lines. The team was established in October last year. At that time, a seriously wounded soldier was sent to the hospital. His injury was severe, and the only emergency treatment was blood transfusion, but the hospital had no blood bank plasma. When the nearby people found out, they automatically requested to donate blood to the soldiers in twos and threes. When the wounded from the Qita battle arrived at the hospital a month ago, an old man with white hair, Wang Duanding, from the voluntary blood donation team also asked to donate his blood to the soldiers. The hospital refused, and he went back dejectedly. Women Wang Jing, Hou Bo, and others also donated the nutritional products given to them by the hospital to the wounded. The sturdy Kou Yutang, Cui Jinghai, Zhao Hongliang, and Sun Yongming broke the blood donation record, each donating 350 "CC" three times. This made the combat heroes feel extremely grateful for the love of the people in the rear. For example, Comrade Wang Yubin suffered a serious bullet wound to his right leg. Before the operation, seven people gave him 470 "CC" of blood, and later another 1,100 "CC" was given. Now he is lying comfortably in bed, full of energy. When he mentioned his injury, he said: "Comrades, my life was given to me by everyone. The people treat us so well. When I return to the front line, I will definitely eliminate more enemies and repay their kindness by defeating the Chiang army!"

　　东北人民热爱民主联军
    竞相输血医治负伤战士
    【新华社东北七日电】某后方医院自愿输血队，自去年十月成立以来，四个月间扩大到九百余人，输血共达十四万“ＣＣ”，使二百多位负伤战士，重上前线。该队成立于去年十月间，当时有一位重伤兵送达该院，伤势沉重，唯一急救的办法，只有输血，但院里没有血库血浆，附近的老百姓知道了，就三三两两的自动要求给战士们输血。月前其塔大战役的伤员抵院时，自愿输血队里有个须发斑白的王端鼎老头，也要求把自己的血输给战士，医院拒绝了，他垂头丧气的回去。妇女王静、侯波等输血后，还将医院送给她们的营养品又转赠伤员了。长得结实的寇玉堂、崔景海、赵洪亮、孙永明则突破了输血纪录，每人三次输出了三百五十“ＣＣ”。使得战斗英雄们对后方人民的热爱，感激莫名。如王玉彬同志右腿弹伤严重，动手术前，七个人给他输了四百七十“ＣＣ”血，后来又给输了一千一百“ＣＣ”，现在他很安详的躺在床上，很有精神，提起他的伤势时就说：“同志，我的命是大家偿给的，老百姓看待咱太好啦，咱再上前线，一定多多消灭敌人，用打垮蒋军来报他们的恩！”
