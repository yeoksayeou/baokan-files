　　[This newspaper, Taihang, 30th dispatch] The Jiao Zuo Municipal Government recently convened a meeting to rectify finances. After inspection, the Third District Public Office was the first to propose that the overspent funds of more than 50,000 yuan, which they had previously requested to be reimbursed, would be resolved through their own production. The Second District also voluntarily reported over 100 *shi* of grain they had previously concealed, and reported that the district still had over 50 *shi* of grain remaining. They requested that no grain be issued to them before the summer harvest, and they donated the grain they had already received to the Fifth District, which is currently experiencing difficulties. The Municipal Finance Section stated: The success of this financial rectification is due to the enlightenment of the cadres and the mobilization of the masses to consciously implement the financial and economic system.

　　焦作二区自报余粮
    【本报太行三十日电】焦作市府于日前召开整顿财政会议。经检查后，三区公所首先提出以前要求报销的超支经费五万余元，自行生产解决。二区亦自报出过去之埋伏粮百余石，并报出区尚存粮五十余石，自请不发夏收以前的粮食，并将已领之粮捐赠现尚困难之五区。该市财政科谈：此次整顿财政的成功，是启发了干部自觉，发动了群众性的主动贯彻财经制度。
