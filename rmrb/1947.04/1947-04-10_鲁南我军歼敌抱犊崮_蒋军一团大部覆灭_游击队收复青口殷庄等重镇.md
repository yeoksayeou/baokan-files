Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, April 4th: A unit of the East China People's Liberation Army launched a self-defensive counterattack against Chiang Kai-shek's troops "mopping up" the Lunan mountain area on the evening of the 29th of last month. After several hours of fierce fighting, they annihilated most of a regiment of the 37th Brigade of the 77th Division of Feng Zhi'an's Chiang Kai-shek troops near Baodugang (north of Zaozhuang). The results of the battle are currently being verified.

Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, April 4th (Delayed): At 7:00 AM on the 18th of last month, the "Lindong" unit of the East China People's Liberation Army heroically resisted over 1,000 men of the 172nd Division of the 7th Army of Chiang Kai-shek's troops who were invading east of Zou County at the foot of Phoenix Mountain. With a very small force, the People's Liberation Army engaged in fierce fighting with the Chiang Kai-shek troops for three hours, repeatedly engaging in bayonet charges seven or eight times, killing and wounding over 250 Chiang Kai-shek soldiers, and then safely transferred to a new position. Having suffered this blow, the Chiang Kai-shek troops dared not advance rashly and were forced to retreat hastily that afternoon.

Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, April 2nd: Chiang Kai-shek troops invading from the north of the Longhai Railway and those harassing from Linyi have repeatedly been met with strong blows from the Binhai District People's Local Corps and militia explosion teams, guerrillas, and armed work teams. According to incomplete statistics for the past month, there have been a total of 230 large and small battles, recovering 168 important villages and towns such as Qingkou, Yinzhuang, Shahe, Shiliushu, Hengwan, and Caopu, killing and wounding Chiang Kai-shek troops and capturing alive "Returning Home Legions" and others, totaling over 1,480 people. Currently, there are no traces of Chiang Kai-shek troops in large areas east of the Shu River. The Chiang Kai-shek troops who have invaded and occupied Linyi are trapped inside the city, startled several times a night. Having suffered this serious setback, the Chiang Kai-shek troops are attempting to follow the "mopping up" tactics of the Japanese invaders, sending out large numbers of special agents in coordination with the "Returning Home Legions" to frequently harass, lure, and deceive the people's armed forces before concentrating their forces, and using this to scout out the situation. Then, they concentrate their forces and carry out rapid surprise attacks over long distances of 50 to 60 li. They move out at night on multiple routes, or when encircling and attacking, they place the "Returning Home Legions" at the head of the troops to lure us to advance deep, and use special agent "Returning Home Legions" disguised as militiamen to confuse the masses. However, these conspiracies and tricks have been shattered by the people's forces who are firm in their fighting spirit and rich in experience.

　　鲁南我军歼敌抱犊崮
  　蒋军一团大部覆灭
  　游击队收复青口殷庄等重镇
    【新华社华东前线四日电】华东人民解放军一部于上月二十九日晚向鲁南山区“清剿”之蒋军发起自卫反击，经数小时激战，将冯治安部之蒋军七十七师三十七旅一个团大师歼灭于抱犊崮（枣庄以北）附近，战果正清查中。
    【新华社华东前线四日电】（迟到）上月十八日晨七时，华东人民解放军“临东”部英勇抗击自邹县城东犯之蒋军第七军一七二师千余人于凤凰山麓，解放军以极少数兵力，与蒋军激战三小时，反复肉搏冲杀七八次，毙伤蒋军二百五十余名后，安全转移新阵地。蒋军受此打击，不敢冒然轻进，当日下午即被迫仓皇后退。
    【新华社山东二日电】由陇海路北犯与临沂出扰之蒋军，屡遭滨海区人民地方兵团及民兵爆炸队、游击队、武工队坚强打击。据一个月来不完全统计，大小战斗共二百三十余次，收复青口、殷庄、沙河、石榴树、横湾、曹蒲等重要村镇一六八处，毙伤蒋军及生俘“还乡团”等一千四百八十余名，现沭河以东大块地区已无蒋军踪迹。侵占临沂之蒋军，困守城内，一夕数惊。蒋军遭此严重挫折，企图因袭日寇之“扫荡”战术，于未集结兵力前，派出大批特务配合“还乡团”进行频繁骚扰诱骗麻痹人民武装，并借此侦察情况，然后集结兵力，迅速以五十里至六十里之长距离进行奔袭。夜晚分路出动，或包围合击时，将“还乡团”置于部队先头，诱我深入，并以特务“还乡团”化装民兵活动，迷惑群众，但这些阴谋诡计，已为战志坚强、经验丰富的人民力量所粉碎。
