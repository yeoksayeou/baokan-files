Jia Qinglian and the Iron Factory

Comrade Jia Qinglian, chairman of the Ironworkers' Union of Malu Street in the southern part of Xingtai City, had been an ironworker for twenty years and had never had a full meal. Since the Eighth Route Army and the Communist Party liberated Xingtai City, he has turned over a new leaf. Now, he not only doesn't worry about food and clothing, but he also built four brand-new bungalows. He often tells people, "If it weren't for Chairman Mao and the Communist Party leading us, how could we have such a good life?" From then on, he actively led the masses and all the workers in the street to participate in the "speak bitterness" liquidation movement. He said, "Following Chairman Mao and the Communist Party is the right thing to do!" When the movement turned to large-scale production, he took the lead again, mobilizing workers to organize production. He helped workers restore old blacksmith furnaces, and nine large furnaces have already been opened in the street. At that time, more than thirty unemployed workers from other places had no way to live. After patiently understanding their difficulties, he went to mobilize the workers to organize an iron factory. He borrowed 2 million yuan in capital from the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions and borrowed a vacant house from the government. The workers saw that he was very enthusiastic in his work, and all thirty-five workers were willing to join the factory, and they automatically pooled their tools and capital.

Comrade Jia Qinglian often held meetings for the workers to consolidate the factory and encourage their enthusiasm for production. He used the method of comparing the present with the past to educate the workers and raise their ideological awareness. On the one hand, he adopted democratic discussions to allow the workers to elect their own cadres to manage the factory, and to formulate various systems and reward methods: 1. Profit sharing: 80% according to labor and 20% according to capital (no public investment is absorbed); 2. Different wage points are set according to different technologies; the craftsmen in the whole factory are divided into five grades: 11 points, 10.5 points, 8.5 points, 8 points, 7 points, hammer swingers 6 points, apprentices 5 points, private tools (complete set) also count as 2 points. 3. Reward method: A certain production standard is stipulated for each furnace (six large plows, nine small plows, ten three-pronged hoes, etc.). For each piece exceeding the standard output, the wage is increased by 400 yuan. The workers in the whole factory have a high enthusiasm for production, and all the personnel participate in labor. In order to respond to the call of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions for meritorious production, the workers automatically increased their working hours and put forward the slogan of "exceeding the standard competition". Workers Jia Zhenduo, Yuan Fushan, Li Wenhua, etc. can make 16 to 20 three-pronged hoes a day, and other workers can make at least 11. Apprentice Hu Xiaojing received 400 yuan a day just for exceeding the standard wage. He happily said, "Working one day now earns more money than working a year in the past." Now the price of finished products produced by the whole factory every day has reached more than 120,000 yuan, and the net profit for the first month is 800,000 yuan. Recently, after Jia Qinglian returned from the municipal production symposium, he set up two retail outlets on Malu Street to promote the factory's finished products and wholesale iron goods from Lucheng and other places, with an average daily turnover of more than 100,000 yuan. These achievements are due to the implementation of reasonable wages, rewards, profit sharing, and the full play of the workers' own management of the factory's democratic spirit and sense of ownership.

　　贾清连和铁工厂
    邢台市南关马路街铁匠工会主席贾清连同志，过去当了二十年的铁匠工人，向来没有吃过一顿饱饭，自从八路军共产党解放邢台市后，他才翻了身。现在他不但吃穿不发愁，还盖了四间新崭崭的平房。他常给人家说：“不是毛主席共产党领导咱，那里有这样好的时光？”从此以后，他积极领导群众和全街工人参加诉苦清算运动。他说：“跟着毛主席共产党走没有错！”当运动转入大生产时，他又起带头作用，发动工人组织生产，他帮助工人恢复旧铁匠炉，全街已开了九个大炉了。当时有三十多个外来失业工人没法生活，他耐心去了解他们的困难后，便去动员工人们组织铁工厂。他找市工会贷了二百万元资本，又找政府借下一座闲房子，工人们看他工作很热心，三十五个工人都愿意参加这个工厂，自动把工具、资本凑合起来。
    贾清连同志为巩固工厂和鼓励工人的生产积极性，经常给工人们开会。他用“看看现在，比比过去”的对比时光的方法来教育工人，提高工人的思想觉悟。一面又采用民主讨论方式，让工人选出自己的干部来管理工厂，并订出各种制度与奖励办法：一、分红：按劳八资二分红（不吸收群众投资）；二、按不同技术定出几种不同的工资分数；全厂把式共分五等：分十一分，一○·五分，八·五分，八分，七分，抡锤六分，学徒五分，私人工具（全套）也顶二分。三、奖励办法：每炉规定出一定生产标准量（大铧六个，小铧九个，三剌十个等），每超过标准产量多出一件增加工资四百元。全厂工人生产情绪很高，全部人员都参加劳动。他们为了响应市职工会生产立功号召，工人们自动增加工作时间，提出“超过标准比赛”口号。工人贾振铎、袁富山、李文华等一天能打三剌十六个至二十个，其他工人最低也能打十一个。学徒胡小景光超过标准的工资一天就分到四百元，他高兴的说：“如今干一天活，比过去干一年挣的钱还要多。”现在全厂每天出产成品价格已达到十二万元以上，头一个月结账赚净利八十万元。最近贾清连从市里开生产座谈会回来后，他又在马路街设立二个门市部推销工厂成品，兼批发潞城等地铁货，每天平均卖十多万元流水。这些成绩，是由于执行了合理的工资、奖励、分红和充分发挥了工人自己管理工厂的民主精神和主人翁思想的结果。（董克）
