Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 10th. Military observers here told reporters today: "In the Liuhe South Campaign, the South Manchuria Democratic Allied Army, with a casualty ratio of one to eighty, annihilated a US-equipped elite division and a regiment of the KMT army in ten hours, and routed a division, crushing Chiang Kai-shek and Du Yuming's fourth offensive, creating a glorious example of the Northeast People's Liberation Army and people's patriotic self-defense war." The observers further pointed out: "Following the great victory on the Songhua River, the great victory in Liuhe South followed closely, which is of great significance for accelerating the passivity of the KMT army in Northeast China and developing the initiative of our army." When reporters asked whether Chiang and Du might draw troops from Rehe or within the customs to reinforce and save their downward trend, the observers smiled and said: "Didn't you see that our army in South Manchuria has already given their reinforcements a 'greeting'? Chiang Kai-shek has been running into walls everywhere in Northeast China, especially after repeated defeats in several offensives in South Manchuria. A month ago, he drew the 89th Division of the 13th Army and two full divisions of the 54th Division, the 20th Provisional Division of the 93rd Army, and two regiments of the 22nd Provisional Division, a total of ten regiments, to reinforce Northeast China, and eight of them invaded South Manchuria. As a result, they were utterly defeated, losing 40% of their troops in less than two months. Chiang Kai-shek and his ilk fantasize about changing the established downward trend by reinforcements, or attempt to concentrate all their efforts to break through South Manchuria first, robbing Peter to pay Paul, but it is too late. The result will inevitably be 'if the carrying pole is not tied properly, both ends will collapse.' Just wait and see." The observers praised the victory of Liuhe South and said: "Our army annihilated four regiments of the KMT army with equivalent forces, achieving a complete victory, which once again proves that the combat effectiveness of the KMT army is weakening day by day, and our army is growing stronger and stronger."
    Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 10th. A reporter recently interviewed Lei Naidian, the captured commander of the 26th Regiment of the 88th Division of the KMT army (formerly mistakenly reported as Lei Naidian) in a certain place. He said, "The battle of Kaoshantun was the most practical test of the attitude of our army (referring to the KMT army) soldiers toward the civil war; the result of the test was that more than 90% voluntarily laid down their weapons." After recalling his long experience since he first participated in the Jiangxi civil war in the 36th Division in the 22nd year of the Republic of China, he sighed and said: "My history of fighting the Communist Party is not short. I have fought from Jiangxi to Northeast China. The facts of the past ten years have told me that the Communist army is getting stronger and stronger, the morale is getting higher and higher, the masses are getting more and more, and the area is getting wider and wider; the KMT army is getting lower and lower in prestige, the morale is getting more and more depressed, and the economy is getting more and more collapsed." Finally, he said thoughtfully: "Xue Zizheng, the chief of staff of Ye Jianying's committee, was my classmate in middle school. We are taking two different paths. He is taking a path with development and prospects, but I used to take a path of destruction." He repeated: "I took the wrong path!"

　　东北蒋军颓势无法挽救
    我军愈战愈强更加主动
    【新华社东北十日电】此间军事观察家今日对记者称：“此次南满民主联军在柳河南战役中，以一比八十之伤亡比例，在十小时内歼灭美械嫡系蒋军一个师和一个团，并击溃一个师，粉碎蒋介石杜聿明四次进攻，首创东北解放军民爱国自卫战争光辉战例。”观察家继指出：“继松花江之大捷后，柳河南大捷接踵而至，对于加速东北蒋军之被动和发展我军之主动，诚具重大意义。”当记者询以蒋、杜有无再从热河或关内抽兵增援挽救其颓势之可能时，观察家笑曰：“君不见南满我军已给其增援部队一个下马威乎？蒋介石在东北到处碰壁，尤在南满几次进攻连遭败北后，月前从热河战场抽出第十三军八十九师及五十四师两个整师、九十三军暂二十师、暂二十二师各两个团，总共十个团增援东北，而以内中之八个团进犯南满。结果一败涂地，未及二月立即损失十分之四。蒋介石辈幻想以增援改变其既成之颓势；或企图集中全力首先突破南满，挖肉补疮，为时已晚。其结果必然是‘扁担没扎，两头失塌’，君试拭目以待。”观察家对柳南之捷备加赞誉，并谓：“我军以相当于敌之兵力，歼灭蒋军四个团，获得全胜，确又一次证明，蒋军战斗力日益削弱，我军愈战愈强。”
    【新华社东北十日电】记者日前在某地访问了被俘蒋军八十八师二六团团长雷乃殿（前误为雷乃电）。他说：“靠山屯一战，是我军（按：指国民党军）士兵对内战态度的一种最实际的测验；测验的结果，百分之九十以上都自愿放下武器。”他回忆了自民国廿二年在三十六师首次参加江西内战起的漫长经历后，叹了一口气说：“我和共产党打仗历史不算短，从江西开始一直打到了东北，十几年来的事实告诉我，共产党军军越打越强，士气越打越旺，群众越打越多，地区越打越广；国民党军队则越打威信越低，士气越打越消沉，经济越打越崩溃。”最后他若有所思的说：“叶剑英委员的参谋长薛子正，是我中学时代的同学，我们走着两条不同道路。他走着有发展有前途的路，我过去却走着毁灭的路。”他重复的说：“我走错了路！”
