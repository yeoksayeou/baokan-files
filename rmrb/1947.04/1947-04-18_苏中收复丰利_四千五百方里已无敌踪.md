　　Suzhong Recovers Fengli
    4,500 Square Li Cleared of Enemy Troops
    [Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 15th] A certain unit of the Suzhong People's Liberation Army recovered the two strongholds of Fengli and Guba, east of the Hai'an-Rugaoline, on the 12th. They captured over 400 people, including the Kuomintang district chief of Fengli, seized over ten light and heavy machine guns, over 200 rifles, and tens of thousands of rounds of ammunition. The Kuomintang and puppet troops in Guba fled upon hearing the news. After the disastrous defeat of the Kuomintang army in the Libao battle, they drove and forced local Kuomintang and puppet troops to hold the above-mentioned two strongholds, attempting to divide the Rudong line into east and west sections. The Liberation Army launched a counterattack on the night of the 11th and recovered the area the next day. By this point, the Kuomintang and puppet troops in Rudong were completely compressed to the Rugao-Juegang line. From Rugao eastward, from the Rugao-Juegang line northward, 4,500 square li reaching the Yellow Sea are now cleared of enemy troops.
