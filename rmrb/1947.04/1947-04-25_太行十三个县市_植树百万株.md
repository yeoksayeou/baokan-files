Thirteen Counties and Cities in Taihang
Plant One Million Trees

[This dispatch from our newspaper in Taihang, dated the 23rd] The tree-planting campaign in various parts of Taihang has concluded successfully. According to incomplete statistics from thirteen counties and cities, over one million saplings of various kinds have been planted, and nurseries have increased to more than 500 mu. Throughout the region, from the administrative office to district and village cadres and the broad masses, everyone was involved in this movement. Along the Zhang River, over 10,000 trees were planted this year, and many comrades constantly checked and watered them after planting. Along the 60-li stretch of the Handan-Changzhi Highway between Changzhi and Lucheng, over 20,000 saplings were newly planted. Traveling merchants said excitedly, "When we come back in ten years, we can rest in the shade of the trees." To improve the tree-planting techniques of various counties, the Changzhi Central Agricultural and Forestry Bureau trained a group of skilled tree planters and production cadres before Qingming. The Third Administrative Office allocated 50,000 yuan to reward tree-planting models and skilled workers along the Handan-Changzhi Highway. The 30,000 trees around the Changzhi City Martyrs' Cemetery, the city's perimeter, and along the streets have all been planted. Along the Qing and Zhuo Zhang Rivers in the territory of Wuxiang, Zuoquan, Xiangyuan, Yushe, and Cixian counties, and along both banks of the Fuyang River, saplings were planted everywhere. In the fifth, sixth, and seventh districts of Shahe County, over 100,000 trees were planted. In Luoyang Village, each person planted an average of 35 trees, and each child planted an average of 20 trees. Li Shunda, a labor hero in Pingshun, used accounting methods to get the masses to think, proposing "If you want to get rich, plant more trees." In three days, more than 40 mu of barren slopes were transformed into orchards. In the first district of Licheng, 33 administrative villages have built 24 mu of nurseries, guaranteeing the survival of 240,000 trees. Under the leadership of labor hero Li Mabao, Shuxin Village in Wuxiang planted 2,000 willow and fruit trees, and also planted 210 grapevines, guaranteeing one living vine for each household. Elementary school students in Xiawan Village in Licheng and Dagang Village in Shexian collectively planted 2,000 trees, designated as the "Children's National Construction Forest." To prevent damage to the trees, each county has established a County, District, and Village Forestry Management Committee, and formulated measures to protect the forests.
