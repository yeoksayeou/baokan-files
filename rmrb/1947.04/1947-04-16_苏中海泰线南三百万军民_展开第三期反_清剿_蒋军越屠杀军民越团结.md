Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 11th: A reporter from the Subei Branch summarized the six-month anti-"encirclement and suppression" struggle of three million soldiers and civilians in the four counties of Jingjiang, Rugao, Taizhou, and Taixing south of the Hai'an-Taizhou line, stating: This area, facing the Chiang government's heartland of Nanjing and Shanghai across the river, is regarded as a thorn in Chiang's side. Since the beginning of the self-defense war, this area has entered the most arduous struggle. Over the past six months, thanks to the heroic struggle of the soldiers and civilians in this area, they have achieved complete victories in the first and second phases of anti-"encirclement and suppression" and are now launching the third phase of anti-"encirclement and suppression" struggle. The first phase of anti-"encirclement and suppression" began at the end of April last year. The Chiang troops first tightly blockaded the two main lines of Hai'an-Taizhou and Nantong-Rugao, isolating the area; then they densely built highway strongholds and carried out sweeps with thousands of people, especially concentrating heavy troops to repeatedly "sweep" the Rugao area. However, after three months of fierce fighting by the soldiers and civilians in this area, the Chiang troops' attempt was completely defeated. The second phase of "encirclement and suppression" began in January, with the Chiang troops adopting a simultaneous approach of "sweeping" and massacre. In the Jiangkou area of Jingjiang alone, they massacred more than 500 young people in one instance. However, under the close unity of the soldiers and civilians, their plan was once again crushed. At this point, the Chiang troops attempted a final struggle, gathering the entirety of their 4th Division, 102nd Brigade, two battalions of the 49th Division, and about eighteen battalions of the Chiang-backed provincial security team, along with the "Returning Home Corps," totaling 20,000 troops, led by the defeated general Li Mo'an, to begin the third phase of "bloody cleansing encirclement and suppression" on March 3rd, which was also the largest and most brutal "encirclement and suppression." The first characteristic of this "encirclement and suppression" was that the Chiang troops openly put forward slogans such as "Rather kill a thousand by mistake than let one slip through." Each time the Chiang troops were dispatched, the officers pre-determined the number of people to be killed. For example, when "cleansing" the Shanhu area of Rugao, the Chiang battalion commander ordered the battalion to kill 800 people that day, resulting in the collective killing of more than 360 people. Even the Chiang soldiers felt squeamish. In Jingjiang, people were killed to the extent that every village had new coffins because the Chiang troops captured and killed people randomly along the way. On March 17th, when the Chiang troops "jointly suppressed" north of the Taixing-Huangqiao road, they swept more than 100 people to death with machine guns in one instance. Bloodstains were everywhere the Chiang troops passed, and cries were heard all over the fields. In total, more than 7,000 innocent people have been killed to date, and more than 20,000 women have been raped. The second characteristic is that the Chiang troops adopted "empty stronghold tactics" militarily, that is, they densely built strongholds, with one stronghold every two miles along each highway, and in the densest cases, there were seven strongholds in ten miles, dividing large areas into countless small, almost airtight blocks; tactically, they adopted methods such as net-like encirclements, mobile attacks, day and night operations, and "self-defense force" cooperation in searches, looking for the main force of the local armed forces to fight a decisive battle, attempting to "annihilate" the living forces of the people's army in one fell swoop. However, the situation in the past month has shown the opposite characteristics. Militarily, although the people's army has some difficulties, it is easier to penetrate the enemy's weak heart and give them serious blows; in one month, they have won twelve battles. On March 4th, when the enemy jointly attacked the Huangqiao area in four routes, the ambushing local armed forces killed or wounded more than 60 enemy soldiers in 25 minutes. On the 8th, the Chiang-backed provincial security team defending Shizhuang in Rugao was dispatched, and the local armed forces counterattacked, creating a glorious battle example of zero casualties versus fifty. According to incomplete statistics, as of April 5th, more than 600 Chiang puppet troops had been annihilated, more than 100 rifles and more than 30,000 rounds of artillery shells and bullets had been seized. Politically, the soldiers and civilians in this area are unprecedentedly united. Whenever a place is jointly attacked, regardless of women, children, or the elderly, tens of thousands of people all "run away," often leaving no one in the area for dozens of miles, not supplying the enemy with a grain of rice or a stick of firewood, and no one willing to be enslaved by the enemy. And when the people's army rushed to the area late at night, each family prepared cooked meals to wait for them. One night, when the people's army penetrated into an area that had just been ravaged by the enemy, hundreds of people greeted them, and many old ladies hugged the soldiers and cried, saying: "My son, you are back." When the local armed forces recovered Zhoujiazhuang in Rugao, dozens of surrounding villages burned incense to celebrate the victory, and tens of thousands of people competed to help in the battle. Even 60-year-old Chen and 12-year-old Xiaohongzhu seized guns. When the soldiers and civilians met, they encouraged each other, saying: "Ninety-nine steps have been taken out of a hundred, just take one more step to achieve the final victory." On the enemy's side, they are extremely panicked. The Chiang troops' "Returning Home Corps" spread the rumor that "March is easy to get through, April is hard to endure, and in May, you'll be in a coffin." For example, the Chiang-backed "self-defense force" in Majiazhuang on the Huangqiao line has fled completely, all of which shows that the three million soldiers and civilians in these four counties will be able to overcome the arduous difficulties and finally achieve victory.

### 苏中海泰线南三百万军民  展开第三期反“清剿”  蒋军越屠杀军民越团结

　　苏中海泰线南三百万军民
    展开第三期反“清剿”
    蒋军越屠杀军民越团结
    【新华社华中十一日电】苏中分社记者综述海（安）泰（州）线以南靖江、如皋、泰州、泰兴四县三百万军民六个月来反“清剿”斗争称：该地区与蒋政府心脏京沪隔江对峙，蒋贼视若眼中钉。从自卫战开始，该地即进入最艰苦的斗争中，近六个月来，由于该地军民英勇斗争，已获一、二期反“清剿”全面胜利，现在已展开第三期反“清剿”斗争。第一期反“清剿”于去年四月底展开。蒋军首先将海（安）泰（州）及南（通）如（皋）两大干线紧紧封锁，使该地陷于孤立；继则密筑公路据点，以数千人进行扫荡，特别集结重兵反复“扫荡”如皋地区。但经该地军民奋战三月，将蒋军企图完全打垮。第二期“清剿”自一月份开始，蒋军采取“扫荡”与屠杀同时并进，仅靖江夹港口一带一次即屠杀青年五百余。但在军民亲密团结下，又将其计划粉碎。至此，蒋军图作最后挣扎，集结其四师一○二旅全部，四十九师两个营及蒋记省保安队约十八个营，连“还乡团”在内共两万兵力，由败将李默庵统率，于三月三日开始第三期“血洗清剿”，亦即规模最大最残酷的一次“清剿”。此次“清剿”第一个特点是蒋军公开提出“宁愿错杀一千，不愿一个漏掉”等口号。蒋军每次出动，军官预先指定杀人数目。如“清剿”如皋珊瑚区时，蒋营长命令该营于是日要杀八百人，结果集体杀了三百六十余人，连蒋军士兵亦觉手软。靖江人民被杀得每庄都有新的棺材，因蒋军沿途捕捉随意乱杀。三月十七日，蒋军“会剿”泰（兴）黄（桥）路北时，一次即用机枪扫死百余人。蒋军过处血迹斑斑，哭声遍野，总计被杀无辜人民迄今已达七千余人，被奸妇女在两万以上。第二个特点是蒋军在军事上采取“空帐战术”，即一面密筑据点，每条公路隔两里即筑一据点，最密者有十里七据点者，使大块地区被分割成无数几无空隙之小块；战术上采取拉网合击、机动袭击、日夜出动、“自卫队”配合搜索等办法，寻找地方武装主力决战，图“一鼓歼灭”人民军队有生力量。但一个月来的形势，却表现为相反几个特点。军事上人民军队虽有若干困难，但却便于钻入敌空虚之心脏，予以严重打击；一个月内，十二战皆捷。三月四日，当敌四路合击黄桥地区时，预伏地方武装二十五分钟内即毙伤敌六十余名，八日防守如皋石庄之蒋记省保安队出动，地方武装一反击，即造成零比五十的光辉战例。据不完全统计，迄四月五日止，已歼蒋伪军六百余，缴步枪百余支，炮弹、枪弹三万余发。在政治上，该地军民空前团结，每合击一地，无论妇孺老幼，千万人全部“跑反”，往往数十里内无人烟，不供敌人粒米根柴，没有一人愿受敌人奴役。而人民军队深夜赶至时，则各家做熟饭等候。某夜，人民军队深入刚被敌蹂躏的地区，成百群众迎接，许多老太太紧抱着战士痛哭说：“我的儿，你回来了。”当地方武装收复如皋周家庄时，周围几十个村庄都焚香祝胜，万人争相助战，连六十岁的陈老太、十二岁的小红珠都缴到了枪，军民相遇时，互勉说：“百步走了九十九，再跨过一步就是最后胜利。”在敌人方面，则极度恐慌，蒋军“还乡团”中传遍“三月好过，四月难挨，五月下棺材”这一流言。如黄线马家庄蒋记“自卫队”已逃跑一空，这都显示着该四县三百万军民必能通过艰苦危难，最后获得胜利。
