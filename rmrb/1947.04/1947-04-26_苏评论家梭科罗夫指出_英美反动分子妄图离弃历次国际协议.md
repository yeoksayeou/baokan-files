　　Soviet Commentator Sokolov Points Out
    Anglo-American Reactionaries Are Attempting to Abandon Past International Agreements
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, April 24th] TASS reports: The well-known Soviet commentator Sokolov recently published an article commenting on the issue of international agreements, pointing out that certain British and American figures are attempting to revise and cast doubt on the solidity of the Potsdam Conference resolutions and other joint resolutions made by various powers on a number of important issues. These issues include matters such as the Polish-German border, German reparations, the nature of Germany's provisional political institutions, and Germany's political and economic unity, etc. Sokolov concludes as follows: The facts show that there is no ambiguity whatsoever in the Potsdam resolutions and other resolutions made by the Allies during the war, and that the work of the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference is becoming complicated or obstructed. It is very clear that the Soviet representative is adhering to the position that these resolutions cannot be changed. The attitude of the Anglo-Saxon powers (referring to Britain and the United States) toward the Tehran, Yalta, and Potsdam resolutions, and the attitude toward the UN Charter reflected in President Truman's so-called "Relief to Turkey and Greece" bill, all prove that there is a dangerous tendency to abandon these resolutions and evade and disregard international agreements. History teaches us that if international treaties are treated as waste paper, there will never be good results. Today, the peaceful coexistence of two different social and economic systems is a very important issue. Those who attempt to abolish the resolutions jointly formulated by the Allies in the Second World War are pursuing a short-sighted policy.

　　苏评论家梭科罗夫指出
    英美反动分子妄图离弃历次国际协议
    【新华社陕北二十四日电】塔斯社讯：苏联著名评论家梭科罗夫顷著文评论国际协议问题，指出某些英美人士企图修改与怀疑波茨顿会议决议与其他各强国关于若干重要问题所作之共同决议的巩固性。这些问题，如像波德边界、德国赔偿、德国临时政治机构的性质、德国政治与经济的统一等等。梭氏得出结论如下：事实显示了波茨顿决议及盟国其他战时所作之决议并无丝毫模糊之处，而使莫斯科外长会议工作趋于复杂或受阻碍。事情很清楚的，苏联代表坚持这些决议不能受到改变的立场，安格鲁萨克逊各强国（按指英美）对德黑兰、雅尔塔、波茨顿决议的态度，和杜鲁门总统所谓“救济土希”法案中反映的对联合国宪章的态度，都证明有离弃这些决议，规避和不顾国际协议的危险倾向。历史教训我们，如果把国际条约当做废纸，是从没有任何好结果的。在今天，两个不同的社会与经济制度的和平共存是很重要的一个问题。那些企图废弃盟国在第二次大战中共同制定之决议的人们，都是在实行近视的政策。
