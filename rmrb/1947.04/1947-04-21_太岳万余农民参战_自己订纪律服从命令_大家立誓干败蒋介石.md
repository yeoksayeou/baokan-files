    Taiyue: Over Ten Thousand Farmers Participate in the War
    They Establish Their Own Discipline and Obey Orders
    Everyone Vows to Defeat Chiang Kai-shek
    The People Are Firmly Confident of Victory
    全力支援爱国战争
    【本报太岳十九日电】Under the slogans of "Defend Chairman Mao, Defeat Old Chiang," a wave of enthusiasm for supporting the war has swept through the front and rear areas of our district. Over ten thousand militiamen and emancipated farmers from Yangcheng, Hongdong, Gaoping, Shimin, Tunliu, and other counties have rushed to the front lines to participate in the war. Farmers in the Houma, Mengcheng and other front areas are automatically rising up to capture counter-reckoning leaders and despotic landlords. A certain militia team from Shimin collectively wrote a letter of determination before setting off, guaranteeing the completion of their mission. When departing, they held high portraits of Chairman Mao and banners proclaiming "Defend the Emancipated Leader Chairman Mao," their faces filled with joyous smiles. More than 4,000 militiamen from Yangcheng, Hongdong and eight other counties arrived at the front lines on the 4th. To ensure 100% completion of their tasks, they voluntarily established disciplines: (1) Resolutely obey orders. (2) Strictly abide by mass discipline and battlefield discipline. (3) Seize every gap in the fighting to train and improve their skills in killing the enemy. (4) Promote unity, fraternity, mutual assistance and care.

    After arriving at the front lines, the Yangcheng stretcher team held a heated discussion on the plan to defend Chairman Mao on the 8th at the Quwo front. Ji Dibo said: "In order to defend Chairman Mao, I dare to run to the bottom of the pillbox to grab the red flag!" Zhang Xueli from the Second District chimed in: "Carrying stretchers is my responsibility. In addition to this, I will also transport ammunition so that the ammunition can be delivered to the soldiers as soon as possible and Chiang Kai-shek will be finished sooner!" Yuan Mingsheng said: "I will do it for two years if it takes two years. I don’t believe we can’t defeat Chiang Kai-shek!" Everyone is thinking of ways to ensure their plans are 100% realized.

    Zhang Tianyi, the county magistrate of Yangcheng, who personally led the stretcher brigade to the front, also called on the cadres to "cadres should endure more hardship so that everyone suffers less." The cadres responded enthusiastically, so the Yangcheng stretcher brigade has maintained high morale and spirit. Everyone is determined to support the front for as long as it fights. Zhang Zhongquan, the deputy district chief of the First District, always does more labor himself, cares about the difficulties of the participating laborers, and often provides cultural and recreational activities for everyone. Seeing someone carrying a ladder fall behind, he mobilized 36 team members to help.

    At the front, militiamen from the Second District of Quwo captured more than 50 counter-reckoning culprits, village-level collaborators, and despotic landlords in three days from the 4th to the 6th. They also captured four special agents who appeared under the name of the "National Defense Ministry People's Service Team". On the 6th, they searched out 49 Chiang troops disguised and hidden in Houma.

    太岳万余农民参战
    自己订纪律服从命令
    大家立誓干败蒋介石
    人民坚定必胜信念
    全力支援爱国战争
    【本报太岳十九日电】在保卫毛主席、打垮老蒋的口号下，本区前后方一致支援战争已成热潮。阳城、洪洞、高平、士敏、屯留等县万余民兵及翻身农民已赶赴前线参战。前方侯马、蒙城等地农民则自动奋起捕捉倒算头子和奸霸地主。士敏某民兵队临行前集体写下决心书，保证完成任务。出发时，高举着毛主席的像和“保卫翻身领袖毛主席”的大旗，脸上充满愉快的笑容。阳城、洪洞等八县民兵四千余人于四日赶到前线后，为保证百分之百完成任务，纷纷自动订立纪律：（一）坚决服从命令。（二）严格遵守群众纪律与战场纪律。（三）抓紧战争空隙练兵，提高杀敌本领。（四）发扬团结友爱，互相帮助与照顾。
    阳城担架队到达前线后，八日在曲沃前线热烈讨论保卫毛主席的计划。吉弟保说：“为了保卫毛主席，我敢跑到炮楼底下去抢彩号！”二区张学礼抢着说：“抬担架是我的责任，除此以外还要运输弹药，让弹药早些送到战士手中，早些叫蒋介石完蛋！”袁明生说：“打二年就干二年，不相信干不败蒋介石！”人人都在想办法保卫自己计划百分之百实现。
    亲自带领担架大队上前方的阳城县长张天乙也向干部号召“干部多吃苦，大家少受罪”。干部纷纷响应，所以阳城的担架大队一直保持着情绪饱满、精神焕发，个个下定决心，前方打多时就支援多时。一区副区长张仲全自己处处多劳动，关心参战民夫困难，并经常给大家作文化娱乐工作。看到抬梯子的人掉队，便动员三十六名队员去帮助。
    在前方，曲沃二区民兵于四日至六日三天中捕获倒算祸首与编村奸伪人员、恶霸地主五十余人。并捕获以“国防部人民服务队”名义出现的特务四名。又于六日搜查出化装隐匿于侯马之蒋军四十九名。
