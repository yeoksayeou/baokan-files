　　How to Implement the Potsdam Agreement
    Wǎ Dìmòfū

    Because the possibility of war is not simply determined by military strength, the Potsdam Conference resolutions specifically addressed the issues of disarming Germany's economy and political democratization. The resolutions stipulated several major principles for disarming Germany militarily, politically, and economically, such as fundamentally eradicating German militarism and Nazism, eliminating Germany's war potential, eliminating Germany's highly concentrated economic monopolies, and thoroughly democratizing Germany.

    However, recently in the British and American occupation zones, there have been attempts to preserve Germany's industrial strength. Of particular note is the fate of Germany's two largest monopoly companies (Farben Industrie and the Steel Company). As early as a year ago, the Allied Control Authority in Germany had decided to abolish Farben Industrie, but it still exists today. In the American zone of Germany, thirteen factories belonging to this company have not yet been abolished, and the leaders of these factories are mostly former Nazis. In Höchst, one of the largest factories belonging to this company still exists. The same is true in the British zone, where the main factories of the Steel Company, concentrated in Dortmund and Bochum, have not been abolished. Moreover, many cooperatives of German industrialists under the leadership of Nazis have been organized, such as the leader of the German Metallurgical Industrialists Cooperative, who is Hitler's close associate Pinschke, and so on.

    The Treaty of Versailles left Germany imperialism a path to restore its strength. All peace-loving countries should remember this pitiful experience of the Treaty of Versailles and pay close attention to the two-sided significance of the plan to restore German heavy industry under the cover of British and American capital. Roosevelt's close collaborator, former Secretary of the Treasury Morgenthau, fiercely criticized Byrnes' policy towards Germany. He wrote in the Swedish newspaper "Kåsören": "If Byrnes actually attempts to overturn the Potsdam resolutions and retain a strong Germany in terms of industry, then I can foresee the repetition of the mistakes of the Treaty of Versailles, and these mistakes could lead to a third world war."

    Disarming Germany industrially does not mean eliminating German industry and turning Germany into an agricultural country, but rather ensuring that German industrial production can maintain a moderate standard of living in Germany and Europe. Everyone knows that by the end of the war, there were many workers but little work in Germany's industrial institutions, while its agriculture could not fully guarantee the country's food needs. According to the Potsdam resolutions, the scope of German industry and agriculture should guarantee a moderate standard of living for the German people and European countries (excluding Britain and the Soviet Union). However, before the war, the average standard of living in Europe was 30 percent lower than that of Germany.

    In his reply to Hugh Baillie, President of the United Press, Marshal Stalin believed that it was necessary to raise the previously allowed industrial level of Germany somewhat, so that the German people could obtain greater guarantees for their lives. Of course, this increase refers to the industrial level for peaceful purposes. The development of this industry is of great benefit not only to Germany but also to the people of other European countries that need German coal, iron, and industrial products.

    This, of course, does not mean reducing the program of disarming Germany economically. As a result of Germany's defeat, its war potential will naturally be greatly reduced, but as Stalin pointed out in his report on November 6, 1944: Historical experience tells us that Germany has enough time in two or thirty years to heal its failures and restore its former strength.

    The reactionary factions in Britain and the United States have put forward a program of leniency towards Germany, a program to protect or expand German industry. In order to camouflage this program, they first proposed to extend the task of managing Germany. However, the painful experience of Versailles proves that without disarming Germany economically, any management of Germany is of a hypocritical nature. German General Staff officer Gillman Thomo said in his book "The Restoration of the German Army": The Germans secretly violated the Treaty of Versailles in front of the Allied Control Commission. In a radio broadcast in Berlin on May 26, 1941, German Major Ulkirch Dil also spoke of this fact: "Germany continues to manufacture new armaments, regardless of any committee's supervision, and in the first few years of its defeat, it established the basis for manufacturing new weapons."

    In 1944, the book by Siegfried Schulz was published in New York. The author was a reporter for the Chicago Tribune in Berlin from 1925 to 1941. A senior official of Krupp told this writer how he deceived the Allied journalists who inspected the factories in the spring of 1919. At that time, this official told them that the parts of the factory that manufactured weapons were parts of civilian industrial machinery. The journalists did not understand these undertakings that did not interest them much. They thought that the war was over and that the Allies had won the final victory; "But," the official continued, "the war is not over for us."

    For the sake of world peace and overall security, the Potsdam resolutions must be resolutely implemented and Germany's economy must be thoroughly disarmed. Otherwise, it will be difficult to manage Germany in the future.

    Marshal Stalin pointed out in his reply to a question from the Moscow correspondent of the British "Sunday Times": "The demilitarization and democratization of Germany is one of the most important guarantees for establishing a solid and lasting peace."

　　如何实现波茨顿协定
    瓦的莫夫
    因为战争的可能性并不是单纯地决定于军事力量，所以在波茨顿会议的决议中，特别提出解除德国经济武装和政治民主化问题；在决议中规定解除德国军事、政治、经济武装的几项重大原则，如根本铲除德国军国主义与纳粹主义，消灭德国战争可能性，消灭德国经济力量非常集中的各种垄断企业，使德国彻底民主化等。
    但最近在英美占领区正企图保存德国的工业力量。特别引人注意的是德国两个最大的垄断公司（法尔本印杜斯特利和钢铁公司）的命运。还在一年以前，驻德协约军管理局已决定了取消法尔本印杜斯特利，可是直到现在依然存在。在德国美占区，到现在还没有取消属于这个公司的十三个工厂，这些工厂的领导者，大部分是以前的纳粹分子。在黑斯特仍存在着属于这个公司的一座最大的工场。在英占区亦然，在多尔特蒙得和柏洪城集中的钢铁公司的主要工场也未取消，不仅如此，而且还组织了许多在纳粹分子领导下的德国大工业家的合作社，如德国冶金工业家合作社的领袖就是希特勒的亲昵者品斯根等等。
    凡尔赛和平会议给与德国帝国主义留下了恢复它的力量的道路，一切爱好和平的国家，要记得凡尔赛会议的这个可怜的经验，而应当十分注意到在英美资本掩护之下，恢复德国重工业的两面意义的计划。罗斯福的密切合作者，前国务院财政部长摩根索，猛烈抨击贝纳斯的对德政策，他在瑞典的“卡者特·德、罗赞”报上写道：“如贝纳斯实际上企图推翻波茨顿的决议，而保留在工业方面强有力的德国，那么，我可以预见重复凡尔赛和约的错误，而这种错误可以引起第三次世界战争。”
    解除德国工业上的武装，这并不是说消灭德国的工业就把德国变成农业化的国家，而是说要使德国工业生产能在德国维持欧洲中等的生活水准。大家都知道，到战争末期，德国的工业机构里工作人员很多而工作却很少，同时他的农业不能完全保证国内粮食的需要。按照波茨顿决议，德国工业和农业的范围应当给与德国人民保证和欧洲国家（英、苏不在此限）以中等生活的水准。但是，在战前，欧洲中等生活的水准比德国的水准低百分之三十。
    斯大林大元帅在答复合众社社长白里的问题中，他认为需要把以前所允许给德国的工业水准提高一些，使德国人生活可得到更大的保证，当然，这个提高是指为和平目的而生产的工业水准，这种工业的发展，不但是对德国，而且对欧洲需要德国煤、铁和工业品的其他国家人民都有很大好处。
    这当然不是说要缩小解除德国经济上武装的纲领。德国战败的结果，它的战争可能性自然会大大减小，但是，斯大林在他一九四四年十一月六日的报告中指出：历史上的经验告诉我们德国在二、三十年中足够去治疗它的失败而恢复自己以前的力量。
    英美两国反动派提出对德宽大的纲领，保护或扩大德国工业的纲领。他们为了伪饰这个纲领，先提出订立延长管理德国的任务，但是，凡尔赛的痛苦经验证明如果不解除德国经济上的武装，那么对于德国的任何管理都是虚伪的性质。德国总司令部的工作人员，吉尔曼·托莫在他作的《德国军队的恢复》一书中说：德国人在同盟国监察委员会的面前，秘密的破坏凡尔赛条约。在柏林一九四一年五月二十六日无线电广播中，德军少校乌尔基德利尔也说到这个事实：“德国继续制造新的武装，不管任何委员会的监察，在它失败的头几年就建立了制造新武器的基础。”
    一九四四年在纽约出版了基格利得·熟利茨的著作，作者自一九二五年至四一年，在柏林《芝加哥论坛》报作记者，曾有戈鲁普的一个大职员告诉这个作家，他一九一九年春天的时候，怎样欺骗监察工场的同盟国的新闻记者，当时，这个职员把工场制造武器的部分告诉他们是平民工业机器的部分。新闻记者不大了解这些对他们不大发生趣味的事业，他们以为战争已经完结了，同盟国已获得最后胜利；“但是——这个职员继续说——战争对于我们并没有完结。”
    为世界和平和全体安全的利益，必须坚决执行波茨顿的决议，彻底解除德国经济上的武装，否则，将来就很难管理德国。
    斯大林大元帅答复英《星期时报》驻莫斯科记者问时指出：“德国的非军国主义化和民主化乃建立牢固与持久和平的最重要的保证之一。”
