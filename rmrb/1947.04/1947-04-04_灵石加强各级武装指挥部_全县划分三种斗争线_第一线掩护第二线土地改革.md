　　[This newspaper, Taiyue, 2nd dispatch] Lingshi County has changed its organizational form, strengthening the armed command, and the struggle of guerrilla warfare and land reform is now underway as a unified body. After the Battle of Lingshi, the county underwent a period of recuperation. Since February 10th, the entire county has been divided into three battle lines according to different regions to carry out guerrilla warfare and land reform. The first line is composed of "maintenance" villages in the enemy-occupied areas and villages with weak past work foundations. On this line, the previously established one or two armed village public offices have been transformed into armed village command posts. Each command post is equipped with ×× militia. In addition to the village chief, the director of the armed committee, and the director of finance and grain, the chairman of the farmers' association, the instructor of the armed committee, and the director of public security also participate. Their tasks are to strengthen stone thunder (improvised mines) and explosions, launch guerrilla warfare and political offensives, destroy the enemy's lower-level organizations, publicize current events and land policies, win people's hearts, suppress reactionary elements, and launch mass struggles against grain grabbing and conscription. The second line is composed of areas that have undergone struggle and have been consolidated, as well as villages that are contested by both the enemy and us. Their task is to hold a gun in one hand and distribute land in the other. The focus of the county's leadership is also placed on this line. The third line is composed of areas that underwent universal land reform struggles last year. Their task is to investigate feudal elements, fill loopholes, and reorganize the organization. In terms of the leadership structure, the past method of the armed committee leading guerrilla warfare and the joint association leading land reform has been changed, and all work is now under the command of the command post; in addition, the county and district command posts have been expanded, and all county committee members, joint association members, the director of public security, and the county brigade instructor participate in the command post to lead guerrilla warfare, land reform, and support-the-front mobilization work throughout the entire territory. Below the district level, work groups are divided according to base points. District cadres participating in the command post serve as group leaders, and all cadres in the group must participate in the village command post during wartime and must not leave their posts without authorization. On the first line, the South Pass and Yan'an village command posts have fought with Yan Xishan's troops twice, killing or wounding four enemies and capturing one "Struggle Corps member" alive. The ×× village command post laid mines to block the enemy and protect land reform on the second line. In the guerrilla war, the Yan'an Village Armed Command insisted on its position and never moved out of the village. On the second line, ten villages including Chen Yin, Xiaozhuang, and Jingsheng have broken through the struggle, and more than 500 farmers have participated in the land reform movement.

　　灵石加强各级武装指挥部
    全县划分三种斗争线
    第一线掩护第二线土地改革
    【本报太岳二日电】灵石县改变组织形式，加强武装指挥部，游击战争与土地改革二位一体的斗争已经展开。灵石战役之后，该县曾经过休整时期，自二月十日开始，全县根据不同地区划分为三种斗争线，进行游击战争与土地改革。第一线是接敌区的“维持”村，及过去工作基础薄弱的村庄。在这条线上，将过去所成立的—二个武装村公所改变为武装村指挥部，每个指挥部配备××民兵，除村长、武委会主任及财粮主任外，农会主席、武委会指导员、公安主任亦参加。其工作任务是加强石雷爆炸，开展游击战争与政治攻势，摧毁敌人下层组织，宣传时事与土地政策，争取人心向我，镇压反动分子与开展群众性的反抢粮抓丁斗争。第二线是曾经过斗争已经巩固了的地区，也是敌我必争的村庄。其任务是一手拿枪一手分田，全县领导的重点亦放在此条线上。第三线是去年经过普遍土地改革斗争的地区，其工作任务是查封建、填窟窿、整理组织。在领导机构上改变了过去武委会领导游击战争、联合会领导土地改革的方法，一切工作归指挥部；并扩大县区指挥部，全体县委、联合会及公安局长、县大队教导员都参加指挥部，领导全境游击战争、土地改革及支前动员等工作。区以下则按基点划分为工作小组。参加指挥部的区干部分任小组长，小组内所有干部在战时要分别参加村指挥部，不得擅离职守。第一线之上南关与延安村指挥部已与阎军作战两次，毙伤敌人四名、活捉“奋斗团员”一名。××村指挥部埋雷封锁敌人，掩护了第二线上的土地改革。在游击战争中，延安村武装指挥部坚持自己的岗位，始终没有转移出本村。第二线上已有陈寅、小庄、静升等十个村突破了斗争，五百多农民参加了土地改革运动。
