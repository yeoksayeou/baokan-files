    Xinhua News Agency, West Manchuria, 18th: On the same day as the opening of the enlarged meeting of the Executive Committee of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Movement Federation, over ten thousand people from all walks of life in Inner Mongolia held an unprecedented grand gathering in Wangye Temple, East Mongolia, to celebrate the new festival of the Inner Mongolian people, "April 3rd" (the anniversary of the founding of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Movement Federation). On the afternoon of the same day, during the adjournment of the first meeting of the enlarged meeting of the Executive Committee of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Movement Federation, people from various regions, holding small red and green flags and shouting slogans, entered the venue with a cheerful mood towards the unity of Mongolians and Hans and the liberation of the Mongolian people. Yun Ze, Chairman of the Inner Mongolia People, Temuer Bagan, Chairman of the Xing'an Provincial Government, Zhang Ce, Vice Chairman, and 28 others were elected to the presidium. In his speech at the meeting, Temuer Bagan pointed out that "April 3rd" is a festival of unity for the people of Inner Mongolia under the correct leadership of Chairman Yun Ze. Over the past year, the masses of Inner Mongolia have gained political awareness, and the liberation movement has achieved preliminary victory. He called on all Mongolian and Han soldiers and civilians to unite and smash Chiang Kai-shek's military offensive. Vice Chairman Zhang Ce called for "inheriting the achievements of the past year and striving for greater victories." Comrades Keli Geng, Bai Yunhang, and others, as well as farmer representative Tao Ke, herdsman representative Dan Ba, worker representative Gao Qingshan, and soldier Pu Shan also spoke at the meeting. A Wuduan Ruibu Buddha Lama also gave a speech at the meeting, expressing that under the leadership of Yun Ze—regardless of Lama, male or female, young or old—they are all willing to strive for the construction of an autonomous government.
    Xinhua News Agency, West Manchuria, 18th: The enlarged meeting of the Executive Committee of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Movement Federation solemnly opened in Wangye Temple, East Mongolia, on the 3rd of this month. A total of 23 executive committee members and alternate executive committee members of the general association, 24 executive committee members and alternate executive committee members of the East Mongolia General Branch, and more than 200 representatives from various ethnic groups attended. Since the "April 3rd" Chengde Conference last year, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Movement, under the leadership of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Federation and Chairman Yun Ze, has achieved great results. The convening of this conference is a great political event in the history of Inner Mongolia. The conference reviewed the work of the autonomous movement in various regions over the past year and discussed the issue of convening the Inner Mongolia People's Representative Conference. In his opening speech at the meeting that day, Chairman Yun Ze stated: "This meeting is a victorious and unified conference. The convening of this meeting shows that the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Movement has achieved great results after the 'April 3rd' conference, and the Inner Mongolia people have achieved preliminary victory in autonomy and liberation. It shows that the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Movement Federation has led Inner Mongolia from a state of division to unity in just one year from the 'April 3rd' conference to the present. Therefore, only unity of thought and will is the main factor determining the complete liberation of Inner Mongolia in the future." Chairman Yun Ze continued to point out: "All strata of the Inner Mongolia people need to unite more closely in the future to defeat the military and political sabotage conspiracies of the Greater Han chauvinist Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique against Inner Mongolia and the aggressive actions of American imperialism against China. Some areas of the Inner Mongolia people are still under the rule of the Kuomintang, and they are still living a life of slavery. They have no freedom. We must develop our victory and rescue our lost fathers and brothers." This was followed by a speech by Vice Chairman Boyan Mandu, who firmly believed that "with unity in Inner Mongolia and the help of the Chinese Communist Party, liberation is entirely possible." The first meeting ended at 1:00 PM. After the reports of each league, the meeting specifically discussed the issue of convening the Inner Mongolia People's Representative Conference.

    蒙汉人民获巩固团结
    【新华社西满十八日电】与内蒙自治运动联合会执委扩大会议开幕同日，内蒙各界万余人，于东蒙王爷庙举行空前盛大集会，庆祝内蒙人民的新节日“四三”（内蒙自治运动联合会成立纪念日）一周年。当日下午，于内蒙自治运动联合会执委扩大会，首次会议休会时，各地群众均手持红绿小旗，高呼口号，充满对蒙汉团结与蒙古民族解放的愉快心情，进入会场。内蒙人民领袖云泽主席、兴安省政府特木尔巴根主席、张策副主席等三十一人，被选为主席团，特氏在大会上致词，指出“四三”是在云泽主席正确路线领导下内蒙人民统一的节日。一年以来，内蒙群众有了政治觉悟，解放运动已获得初步胜利，他号召全体蒙汉军民，团结起来，粉碎蒋介石的军事进攻。张策副主席号召：“要承继去年一年的成绩，争取更大的胜利。”会上并有克力更、白云航等同志及农民代表陶克、牧民代表丹巴、工人代表高青山、战士蒲膻等讲话。阿五端瑞布佛爷喇嘛，亦在会上讲演，他表示在云泽领导下——不分嘛喇、男女、老少，都愿为建设自治政府而奋斗。
    【新华社西满十八日电】内蒙自治运动联合会执委会扩大会议，本月三日在东蒙王爷庙隆重开幕。出席总会执委及候补执委二十三人，东蒙总分会执委与候补执委二十四人，及各族来宾代表二百余人。自去年“四三”承德会议迄今，内蒙自治运动在内蒙自治联合总会及云泽主席领导下，已获得伟大成绩，此次大会召开，更是内蒙历史上伟大的政治事件。大会检讨一年来各地自治运动工作，并讨论召开内蒙人民代表会议的问题。云泽主席在是日会议的开幕词中称：“此次会议，是一个胜利的统一的大会，这个会议的召开，说明了“四三”会议之后，内蒙自治运动已获得很大成绩，内蒙人民已获得自治解放初步胜利，说明了内蒙自治运动联合会在去年“四三”会议到现在仅仅一年中使内蒙由过去的分裂状态走上了统一与团结，因此今后只有思想与意志的统一，才是决定内蒙古彻底解放的主要因素。”云泽主席继指出：“内蒙人民各个阶层，今后需要更加亲密团结起来，打倒大汉族主义者蒋介石反动派对内蒙的军事、政治破坏阴谋及美帝国主义对中国的侵略行动。内蒙人民尚有部分地区在国民党统治下，他们仍然过着奴隶生活，他们没有自由，我们一定要把我们的胜利发展下去，挽救失去自由的父老兄弟。”继为博彦满都副主席讲话，他坚信“内蒙有了团结，有了中国共产党的帮助，是完全可以得到解放的。”首次会议于下午一时结束，会议特于各盟报告工作后，即讨论召开内蒙人民代表会议问题。
