　　The guerrilla warfare in the plains of western Hebei is raging, forcing the enemy into a defensive position. Since March, the people's armed forces of the Taihang First Military Sub-district have been active in the border areas and behind enemy lines, dealing a heavy blow to the enemy's looting plot. On the 8th, more than 30 members of the "Homecoming Corps" from Gaojiazhuang, west of Yuanshi City, attempted to go to Goubei, Shangzhuang, Suyang and other areas to loot grain and disrupt the market. They were ambushed by our local armed forces, with 12 captured alive, 6 rifles seized, more than 100 rounds of ammunition, and 1 livestock. We suffered no casualties. On the 14th, another unit of ours, led by militiamen, penetrated into Nanwu Village, west of Yuanshi Douji Station, surrounded by bunkers. At breakfast time, about 60 puppet troops from Liaocun went to urge the farmers, and after 40 minutes of fierce fighting, more than 200 puppet troops from Yincun reinforced them before we withdrew. It is estimated that we killed one and a half squads of the enemy, captured three people including the intelligence director, and seized two small cannons, three rifles, one pistol, and more than 200 rounds of ammunition. In early March, when the stubborn puppets in Shijiazhuang launched a large-scale mopping-up operation against the border between Yuan(shi), Jing(xing), and Huo(lu), the local armed forces took advantage of the enemy's empty rear and detoured to the rear to attack the "Homecoming Corps"'s frantic looting and intercept their supply lines. The Jingxing Independent Battalion was active near the Liangdu stronghold, and the Yuanshi Independent Battalion killed one puppet soldier and one "Homecoming Corps" member on the Yincun-Nanzuo line on the 3rd, wounded 10 and captured 57 fleeing landlords. The Huolu Independent Battalion, regardless of extreme fatigue, crossed mountains and ridges day and night to return to Shuiyu near the Zhengtai Railway, annihilating 45 members of the grain-robbing "Homecoming Corps", seizing 1 machine gun, 28 rifles, and 6 pistols. This created a model battle example of “enemy advances, we advance” with a ratio of 0 to 45. In the past month, the militia work teams and flying demolition teams of the First Military Sub-district have been dispatched one after another. The power lines along the railway have been cut from time to time, and explosions have been heard from time to time behind enemy lines and in border areas. In early March, the militiamen of Wucun in the Fifth District of Yuanshi used stone mines combined with sniper fire to repel the invasion of more than 300 puppet troops led by Wei Yonghe from Yuanshi City, inflicting 6 casualties on the enemy. On the 4th, the Zhishakou militiamen of the First District in the border area of Jingxing went to the Beishan ridge to lay landmines, wounding one enemy. The next day, they buried landmines at the base of the Yu's blockhouse, and then shouted slogans. Soon, a special agent went to report the news and stepped on a landmine, becoming a "wronged ghost." Now, the masses in the border areas of the entire sub-district are praising the power of landmines and stone mines, and are stepping up their construction. Women in Nanzhangcheng, Jingxing, have now made more than 300 stone mines themselves. Due to the active attacks behind enemy lines by our army and people in the border areas, the masses in the stubborn occupied areas have been inspired, and fleeing personnel have returned one after another. Villages that did not contact us in the past have begun to find relationships to make contact. Even the Yuanshi x stronghold under enemy rule has been connected with our democratic government. In this situation, the enemy is digging ditches and building walls everywhere, compiling Baojia, forcing sentry duty and guarding, and using superior forces to cover the construction of fortresses in Nanfangling in Jingxing, Lingdi, Hanzhuang, and Shuiyu in Huolu, and Fucunzhuang between Yuanshi and Dachenzhuang for alert.

　　(Reported by our newspaper in Gaoyi) After four major upsurges last year, the land reform in Gaoyi County as a whole has largely realized "land to the tiller." Because Gaoyi is located on the edge and is closer to the Chiang Kai-shek puppets in Yuanshi, after the masses gained benefits, they demanded to be armed to protect their fruits. In this situation, the county headquarters clearly put forward at the district and village armed cadre meeting on March 20: "Arouse the entire population to engage in armed warfare using stone mines and landmines, thoroughly eliminate the Homecoming Corps, protect the fruits of liberation, and protect this year's great production." This call was immediately responded to by the 70,000 people of the county. After the meeting, Wang Qingchang (director of the Armed Committee of Beiguan Village), a hero in killing the enemy, convened a meeting of all militiamen in Beiguan on the evening of the 22nd to study the local war situation. During the mobilization, Wang Qingchang said: "The enemy has been to our Beiguan, and we fired a lot of bullets but didn't kill a single enemy. If we had dug some stone mines earlier and installed some bottle mines at the entrances of our village streets to block them off, the enemy would definitely be blown up as soon as they entered the village. This would save money and labor." However, some people did not believe that stone mines could work, and at the same time pointed out that there were no stones or drills. At this time, Wang Qingchang explained the ways to overcome these difficulties and personally made a stone mine for testing the next day. As a result, it exploded into very small pieces and had great power. Concrete facts opened up the militiamen's minds and aroused everyone's enthusiasm. On the same day, 123 detonators and 10 stone mines were made. The armed self-defense teams and women, seeing the great effect of stone mines, all came to learn how to make them. Now, no one in Beiguan is not chiseling stone mines. A total of 864 stone mines have now been chiseled, and 232 bottle mines have been installed. In one day, the village of Lijiazhuang installed 340 bottle mines. Women and children automatically formed groups, and on the 28th alone, the children chiseled 28 stone mines. After testing in Xizhang Village and Songjiazhuang, Shi Tianbao, a 64-year-old liberated farmer, said: "This thing really works. It saves money and labor, and it is safe to blow up the enemy. Don't look at my old age, I guarantee to chisel five stone mines and install five bottle mines within a month." Wubai Village had paid attention to indigenous weapons before. The village has newly built 54 indigenous cannons and 27 wire guns. From last year to now, Chiang's special "Homecoming Corps" had been to the edge of his village four times. Because their fortifications were well built and they had a large number of indigenous weapons, the enemy never entered the village once. This time, the leadership called on them to chisel stone mines, and the people were very happy. Xing Yutai, the indigenous cannon team leader, took the lead and personally went to the station to pull stones and strike drills. The village planned to chisel 3,000 stone mines and install 1,000 bottle mines in February, and completed 1,646 stone mines and installed more than 700 bottle mines within ten days. Now, the sound of chiseling stone mines resounds in every village in Gaoyi County.

　　冀西全区武装益壮大
    迫使蒋伪完全处于挨打状态
    【本报讯】冀西平原地区遍燃游击战火，迫敌处于防御状态。三月以来，太行一分区人民武装活跃边地及敌后，予敌抢掠阴谋以重大打击。八日元氏城西高家庄将记“还乡团”卅余人，图赴沟北、上庄、苏羊一带抢粮，扰乱集市，遭我当地武装伏击，生俘十二人，缴步枪六支，子弹百余发，牲口一头。我无伤亡。十四日，我另一部由民兵带领，深入元氏豆姬车站西侧，碉堡环绕的南吴会村内，待至早饭时，聊村伪军六十余前往催夫，激战四十分钟后殷村伪军二百余人增援我始撤退，计被我击毙敌一个半班，俘情报主任以下三人，缴小炮两门，步枪三支，手枪一支，子弹二百余发。在三月初，石家庄顽伪向我元（氏）、井（陉）、获（鹿）边界大举扫荡时，当地地方武装趁敌后方空虚，各以一部绕到敌后，打击“还乡团”的疯狂掠夺，阻击其补给供应线。井陉独立营活跃于良都据点附近，元氏独立营于三日在殷村至南佐线上毙图返殷村伪军及“还乡团”各一人，伤十人擒获逃亡地主五十七人。获鹿独立营则不顾极度疲劳，拔山越岭星夜钻返正太沿线附近之水峪，歼灭抢粮“还乡团”四十五人，缴机枪一挺，步枪二十八支，手枪六支。创敌进我进中○比四十五模范战例。近一月来，一分区民兵武工队，飞行爆炸组均纷纷出动，铁道边之电线时被割断，敌后及边地不时传出爆炸声。元氏五区吴村民兵以地石雷结合冷枪，于月初击退元氏城伪军魏永和三百余人进犯，敌人伤亡六人。井陉边地一区支沙口民兵于四日到北山梁上埋地雷，炸伤敌人一个，次日把地雷埋到于家炮楼根，随后进行喊话，不多会特务去报讯，踏响地雷，作了“冤死鬼”。现全分区边地群众皆互相称颂地雷、石雷爆炸威力，加紧赶造，井陉南障城妇女现已自造石雷三百余。边地由于我军民主动出击敌后，振奋了顽占区群众，逃亡人员纷纷返来，过去不与我接头村庄，开始各方找关系接头。即敌统治下的元氏×据点，亦已与我民主政府接上头。敌处此境况之下，处处挖沟筑墙，编制保甲，强迫站岗守卫，并以优势兵力掩护在井陉之南方岭，获鹿之岭底、韩庄、水峪，元氏与大陈庄间之富村庄筑堡警戒。（纯一）
    【本报高邑讯】高邑全县的土地改革，经过了去年四次大高潮，大体上实现了耕者有其田。因高邑处于边沿，离元氏蒋伪较近，所以在群众得到利益后就要求武装起来保卫果实。在这样情况下，县指挥部在三月二十日的区村武装干部会上，响亮的提出：“全民武装开展石雷地雷战，彻底消灭还乡团，保卫翻身果实，保卫今年大生产”。这一号召立刻得到了全县七万人民的响应。会议结束后，杀敌英雄王庆昌（北关村武委会主任），在二十二日晚即召开了北关全体民兵研究当地战争情况。在动员时王庆昌说：“敌人到过咱北关，咱打好些子弹也没打死一个敌人，咱们如早些凿些石雷，再装些瓶子雷下在咱村边街口把街道封锁起来，敌人只要进村，保险能炸他几个，这样又省钱又省工”。但有些人不相信石雷能顶事，同时提出没有石头，没有钻子。这时王庆昌把克服这些困难的办法说明，第二天并亲自作好一个石雷进行试验，结果炸的很碎，威力很大，用具体事实打通了民兵思想，鼓起大家的热情，当天就造了雷管一百二十三个，石雷十个。武装自卫队及妇女看见石雷作用大，都来学造石雷。现在北关全关人民没有一个不在凿石雷，现在已凿好石雷共八六四个，装好瓶子雷二三二一个。李家庄在一天就装好瓶子雷三四○个，妇女儿童都自动结合了小组，在二十八日那一天儿童就凿了二十八个石雷。西张村，宋家庄试验后，六十四岁的翻身老农史田保说：“这东西就是顶事，真是又省钱，又省工，炸敌人又保险，不要看我年纪大，我在一月内保证凿五个石雷，装五个瓶子雷”。五百村在以前就注意土武器，该村共新造土炮五四门，线枪二七支。在去年到现在，蒋特“还乡团”曾到他村村边四次，因他们工事修的好，有大批土武器，敌人一次也没有进了村里。这次领导上号召凿石雷，老百姓非常高兴，土炮队长邢玉太首起模范，亲自到车站上拉石头，打钻子。该村计划在二月内凿三千个石雷，装一千个瓶子雷，十天内就完成一六四六个石雷，并装好瓶子雷七百余个。现在高邑全县每个村子，都响彻着凿石雷的铁锤声。
