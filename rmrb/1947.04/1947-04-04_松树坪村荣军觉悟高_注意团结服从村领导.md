　　Rongjun of Songshuping Village Have High Awareness;
    Pay Attention to Unity and Obey Village Leadership
    [Our newspaper, Zuoquan] In the fruit distribution in Sanqu Songshuping, the demobilized soldiers do not act special, are not selfish, stand with the masses, and help the masses to turn themselves over. Among the eleven demobilized soldiers in the whole village, only Comrade Yu Rongren disregarded the masses and boasted about his contributions. He was not satisfied with the three distributions of fruit. This time, he divided a lot of things. At the same time, he used his status as a demobilized soldier to intimidate cadres and the masses, and he was not united with the newly settled demobilized comrades. On the 25th of this month, all the demobilized soldiers in the village gathered to conduct mutual self-criticism. Comrade Zhang Tiancai, who had just settled down, said: "Although we have retired from the army, our revolutionary task has not yet been completed. The bandit Chiang has not been defeated, and many revolutionary fighters are still fighting bravely for the revolution in front, regardless of bloodshed, away from their parents, wives, and children. Today, military families should be put first." Comrade Li Yushan said: "We have a higher awareness than the masses. We should fight in the front and distribute the fruits in the back. We should not be special. We should follow the masses. If we have a problem, the masses will definitely see it." Everyone unanimously criticized Comrade Yu Rongren. Finally, the demobilized comrades proposed that we are for the masses, the masses are for us, adjust relations with cadres and the masses, unite even more, not be detached from the masses, and definitely obey the leadership of the village. We must go wherever we are assigned. (Shen Xiuzeng)

　　松树坪村荣军觉悟高
    注意团结服从村领导
    【本报左权讯】三区松树坪荣退军人在分果实中不特殊，不自私，和群众站在一起，帮助群众翻身。全村十一个荣退军人中只有一个于荣仁同志不顾群众，夸自己功劳，分了三次果实没分够，这次又分东西甚多，同时还凭荣退军人资格威吓干部群众，并且和新安家荣退同志不团结。本月二十五日，全村荣退军人集会，互相进行检讨，新安家的张天才同志说：“我们虽然退伍下来，但革命任务还未完成，蒋贼还没有打垮，许多革命的战斗员离别家中父母妻子，还在前方不怕流血为革命而奋斗，今天应把军属放在第一位。”李玉山同志说：“咱们比群众觉悟高，应当斗争在前，分果实在后，不应当特殊，应该随同群众，自己有圪洞群众一定会看见。”大家一致对于荣仁同志进行了批评。最后荣退同志们提出咱为群众，群众为咱，和干部群众调整关系，更要团结，不脱离群众，一定服从村上领导，该走差一定走差。（申秀曾）
