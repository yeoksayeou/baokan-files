　　The Entire Village of Chengdong, Men, Women, Old and Young, All Go to the Fields
    Village-Wide Mutual Aid and Work Distribution Based on Person
    [Our newspaper, Lingchuan News] On April 6th, the village chief, Farmers' Association chairman, and production committee members of the Chengdong United Defense Village in Lingchuan held a meeting to summarize the spring plowing work of the previous ten days. In the summary, they created an experience that combines participation in war and spring plowing: 1. Village-wide mutual aid – whether it be militiamen, self-defense forces, old men, children, or women, all participate in mutual aid groups, work is converted into points, and work points are recorded; militiamen and self-defense forces participating in war are also awarded work points. 2. Planting according to the season – taking the village as a unit, all arable land is accounted for, and according to each household's production plan, crops are planted according to their early or late nature and season. For example, cotton is planted around Qingming Festival [Tomb Sweeping Day], regardless of whose land it is, even if militiamen are fighting at the front, it will be planted for them. 3. Distributing work based on person – apart from militiamen and self-defense forces participating in war, all those at home are assigned work based on their labor strength. For example, women dig up stubble, children break up clods and pick up stones, older children drive carts to deliver manure, and old men plow the land; men with stronger labor power dig borders, build embankments, and spread manure. 4. Cadres take the lead – cadres who do not participate in the war and remain in the village participate in groups and work themselves, leading one or two groups, and solving problems in a timely manner. In order to save manpower, women in Chengdong have also organized cooking; every four or five households nearby only leave one woman to cook, and the women freed up also go to the fields to work, and students also participate in production; some attend classes in the morning and labor in the afternoon, some labor both morning and afternoon and attend classes at noon, and some participate in labor all day and attend classes after dinner. The people's habit was originally "rest at noon during Qingming," "drink soup during Grain Rain," but in order to free up time to participate in the war more, Chengdong doesn't even rest at noon, and goes to the fields immediately after eating. After everyone summarized, they proceeded to arrange the work for the next ten days: 1. The front and rear work together, only by defeating old Jiang [Chiang Kai-shek] can we be at peace. 2. At home, obey production mutual aid, and complete tasks when participating in war outside. 3. Four days on field ridges, three days on stubble, plant trees, plant cotton, and spread manure, and old women should spin yarn at home. The meeting didn't take half a day, and the work arrangement was also clear and simple, and everyone went back to work.

　　城东村男女老幼一齐下地
    全村互助按人分活
    【本报陵川讯】四月六日，陵川城东联防村长农会主席、生产委员等开会总结上十天春耕工作，在总结中创造出参战与春耕结合的经验：一、全村大互助——不论民兵自卫队老汉小孩妇女，一齐参加互助组，按活折分，按分记工，民兵自卫队参战也记工。二、按季节下种——以村为单位，满打满算，所有耕地都在数，再按各户生产计划，分别农作物迟早性质，分季下种。如清明前后种棉花，就不论谁家都种上，民兵参战在前方也给他种上。三、按人分活——除民兵自卫队参战外，凡是在家的，各组就按劳力强弱分配生活。如妇女刨茬，儿童打圪拉、拾石头，大儿童赶车送粪，老汉犁地；劳力较强的男人，刨边垒堰撒粪。四、干部起带头作用——不去参战留在村里的干部，分头参加小组亲自动手，并领导一两个组，发生问题及时解决，为了节约人力，城东妇女把做饭也组织起来；房前房后左壁右邻，每四五家，只留一个妇女做饭，抽出来的妇女，也去地做活，学生也都参加了生产，有的上午上课，下午劳动，有的上下午都劳动，晌午上课，有的白天全部参加劳动，晚饭后上课。老百姓的习惯，本来是“清明歇晌”，“谷雨喝汤”，城东为了腾出工夫多参战，就连晌都不歇，一吃了饭，就往地去。大家总结后，接着就布置下十天工作：一、前方后方一齐干，打倒老蒋才安然。二、在家服从生产互助，在外参战完成任务。三、四天边垅三天茬，栽树种棉把粪撒，老太婆在家要纺花。会议没有用了半天，工作布置也很明确简单，大家回去就干起来。          （恕先）
