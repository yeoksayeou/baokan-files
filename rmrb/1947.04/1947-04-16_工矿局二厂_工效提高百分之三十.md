　　Second Factory of the Industry and Mining Bureau
    Work Efficiency Increased by 30%
    [This Newspaper's Report] The Second Mechanical Factory of the Border Region Industry and Mining Bureau is rebuilding its new home, and work efficiency has increased by 30%. The factory originally belonged to the Liuhegou Coal Mining Company and moved to a certain location last winter. Since the "Combat Readiness Hero Conference" on January 26th, the workers have transformed their mindset from that of hired laborers in the enemy and puppet era to that of masters, putting forward the slogan of "rebuilding a new home." They said: "In the past, no one cared even if we died from exhaustion. Now we must overcome all difficulties and rebuild our home." Therefore, all the factory workers formulated a production plan to "guarantee quality, increase production, and save raw materials." The fitter department even implemented a ten-hour work system (nine hours of work, one hour of study). Many workers' production enthusiasm is higher than ever before. For example, mechanic Zhen Wanghe used to make one figure-eight wheel a day, but in March he increased it to seven. Foundry worker Cao Weixin previously took nine days to cast a set of gear wheels, but now he has reduced it to three days. Old foreman Zhao Jianyin, who is over sixty years old, burned his foot with molten iron, which has ulcerated into sores. The factory advised him to rest, but he said, "If I rest, no one will set the furnace. As long as I don't collapse, I can work." Old man Du Xiyuan (baking furnace foreman) is old and weak, but still strives to swing a 20-pound sledgehammer, and often says, "Working won't make you sick," to encourage himself. In the midst of increased production, the relationship between master craftsmen and apprentices has also improved unprecedentedly. Master craftsmen have changed their past conservatism, believing that skills cannot be taken to the grave, and that training apprentices is their glory; and apprentices have also overcome their past extreme democratic tendencies, and everyone is working extra hard in their studies. Therefore, since March, the construction of an eight-foot-long car, which used to require 150 workdays, now requires only more than 90. The road repair department averaged 4.1 meters per worker in combat readiness, but now it is 7.3 meters. In other departments such as foundry and fitter, work efficiency has also increased by 30%. Quality has also improved. (Xiang Ting, Zai Jiu)

　　工矿局二厂
    工效提高百分之三十
    【本报讯】边区工矿局第二机械厂重建新家务中，工作效率提高百分之三十。该厂原属六河沟煤矿公司，于去冬迁至某地。自一月二十六号备战英雄大会后，职工们一变敌伪时代之雇佣观点为主人翁，提出重建新家务口号。他们说：“过去受死了也没人管。现在我们一定克服一切困难重建家务”。于是全厂职工订出了：保证质量、提高产量、节省原料的生产计划。钳工部更实行了十小时工作制（九小时工作，一小时学习）。许多工友，其生产情绪之高为前所未有，如机工甄旺合旋八字轮，过去一天作一个，三月份内竟增至七个。翻砂工人曹维新以前翻牙轮九天一套，现在减为三天一套。六十多岁的老工长赵鉴印因铁水烫了脚，已溃烂成疮，厂方劝他休息，他说：“我休息了没人套炉，只要躺不倒就能工作”。老头子杜喜元（烘炉工长）年高力弱，仍争着轮二十磅大锤，并常说：“做活就不会病”，来鼓励自己。增产中，工（匠）徒（弟）关系亦空前改善。工匠改变了过去的保守主义，认为技术不能带进坟墓，培养学徒是自己的光荣；而学徒亦克服了过去极端民主倾向，大家在学习上格外加油。因此，三月份以来，过去一部八尺元车需工一五○个，现减为九十多个。修道部备战中平均每个工四米一，现在是七米三。其他翻砂、钳工等部，工效亦提高百分之三十。质量亦有增进。（襄廷、在久）
