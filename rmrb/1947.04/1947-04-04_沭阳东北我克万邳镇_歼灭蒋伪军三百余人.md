Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 1st: A certain unit of the Huaihai Local Corps fiercely attacked and recaptured Wanpi Town on the Shuyang-Ganyu line on the morning of March 18th. The town was a central stronghold for Chiang Kai-shek's puppets in the border area of Donghai, Shuyang, and Tongyang (Xin County), surrounded by strong fortifications such as trenches, bunkers, barbed wire, and caltrops. The houses within the town were built into interlocking small strongholds, mutually supporting each other. The Chiang-Kai-shek Shuyang Fourth District Office and the Wanpi, Dafang, and other five township public offices were all entrenched within.
