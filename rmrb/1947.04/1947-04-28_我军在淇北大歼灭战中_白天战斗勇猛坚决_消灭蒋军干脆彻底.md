Xinhua News Agency, North Henan Front, April 23rd: Our special correspondent Li Pu reports: The characteristics of the battle in which General Liu Bocheng's unit annihilated more than two brigades of Chiang's troops northeast of Qixian County are: First, the People's Liberation Army acted swiftly, bravely, and resolutely, and, contrary to the past practice of fighting at night, launched an offensive during the day. On the 16th, the Second Rapid Column (i.e., the 49th Brigade) of Chiang's army, which was acting as the vanguard, advanced to Zhaicun, 12 li southeast of Yigou Railway Station, and immediately received orders to contract. The People's Liberation Army then marched at a rate of 13 li per hour, forcefully inserting itself behind the enemy to block their retreat. On the 17th, the People's Liberation Army continued to attack bravely during the day, giving the Chiang troops no chance to catch their breath. Finally, the headquarters and two regiments and an engineer battalion of the 49th Brigade were compressed into the Daxiaohuying area, leaving them no time to build fortifications. The battle was resolved that evening with brave and resolute action. Second, the annihilation was therefore extremely thorough and complete; no one, from the brigade commander to the stable boy, escaped. All officers and weapons on the brigade's establishment were captured in their entirety. Third, the PLA's offensive power is growing stronger. For example, when the headquarters and seven battalions of the 49th Brigade were finally wiped out, the PLA only used five battalions in combat, with each PLA soldier fighting an average of one and a half Chiang soldiers. Fourth, the Chiang troops suffered unprecedented casualties, while the PLA suffered minimal casualties. The PLA's day and night attacks meant that the Chiang troops had no time to build fortifications, and were crowded into the original five blockhouses of the common people. The PLA's artillery fire was extremely well-organized, and every time a blockhouse was destroyed, several hundred of them would be killed, while the PLA suffered very few casualties. In the annihilation of a battalion of Chiang's troops in Xiaohuying, our own casualties were only a dozen or so.

　　我军在淇北大歼灭战中
    白天战斗勇猛坚决         
    消灭蒋军干脆彻底
    【新华社豫北前线二十三日电】本社特派记者李普报导：此次刘伯承将军某部在淇县东北消灭蒋军两个多旅之战的特点称：第一、解放军动作迅速勇猛坚决，并且一反过去夜间作战的惯例，在白天发动攻势。十六日，蒋军担任先锋之第二快速纵队（即四十九旅）进到宜沟车站东南十二里的翟村，立即奉命收缩。解放军乃以每小时十三里的速度强行军，插到他的后方，阻住其退路。十七日白天，解放军继续英勇出击，使蒋军毫无喘息机会。最后把四十九旅旅部和两个团及一个工兵营压缩到大小胡营，使他们连作工事的时间都没有。当日晚间便以勇猛坚决的动作解决战斗。第二、因此消灭的极其干脆彻底，从旅长到马夫一个也没有跑掉。该旅编制上所有的军官和武器全部照数俘获。第三、解放军之攻击力日益旺盛，如最后消灭四十九旅旅部及七个营时，解放军只使用了五个营作战，平均每一个解放军打一个半蒋军。第四、蒋军伤亡之大与解放军伤亡之小是空前的，解放军日以继夜的攻击，蒋军没有时间作工事，成堆的挤在老百姓原有的五个炮楼里，解放军炮火组织极为严密，每轰毁一个炮楼，就要打掉他好几百人，而解放军伤亡极小。在小胡营歼灭蒋军一个营，自己仅伤亡十多人。
