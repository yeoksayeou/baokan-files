Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 7th: TASS reports: The well-known Soviet commentator Lippudov recently published an article in *Izvestia*, exposing the connection between the plan to divide Germany and the policy of international monopoly capital, stating: "No matter what method is adopted, separating the Rhine and Westphalia regions from Germany and combining them with British and American monopoly capital would, in effect, turn them into the behind-the-scenes rulers of the Ruhr. These British and American monopoly capitalists are making every effort to monopolize the world's steel and metal industries, and this plan cannot be realized without political control of the Ruhr. If Bavaria were immediately separated from a unified Germany, actual control of the area would inevitably fall into the hands of the Morgan banking group under the protection of the American occupation authorities. Finally, if southern Germany, including Hesse, Baden, and Württemberg, which are now under American occupation, were to become isolated states, huge agricultural, industrial, and chemical industrial trusts would form a political and economic axis there, just as the Rhine and Westphalia regions would become a base for international steel syndicates, and the Frankfurt area would become a base for international chemical industrial syndicates. Therefore, a unified German nation would be erased from the map of Europe. The connection between this plan to divide Germany and international monopoly capital is visible to everyone."

　　消息报评论家著论揭露 　 英美垄断资本
  　力图分裂德国
    【新华社陕北七日电】塔斯社讯：苏联著名评论家李浦多夫顷在消息报著论，揭露分割德国计划与国际垄断资本政策之联系称：“无论采取什么方式，将莱茵、威士特法里亚区分割于德国之外，与之结合的英美垄断资本，事实上就会变为鲁尔的幕后统治者。这些英美垄断资本正竭尽努力来垄断世界的钢铁与金属等工业，这个计划没有对鲁尔的政治控制就不能实现。假若巴伐利亚立刻从统一的德国分割出去，该地的实际控制权将不可避免地在美国占领当局的保护下，落入摩根银行集团的财阀手中。最后，假若德国南部黑森、巴登、武登堡等地现在美国占领下变为一些孤立的国家，巨大的农事工业与化学工业的托拉斯，就会在那里形成政治经济的轴心，一如莱茵、威士特法里亚区变为国际钢铁迭加尔的基地一样，法兰克福地区也会变为国际化学工业辛迭加的基地。因此，统一的德意志国家就将由欧洲地图上擦掉。这种分割德国计划，和国际垄断资本的联系，是谁也看得见的。
