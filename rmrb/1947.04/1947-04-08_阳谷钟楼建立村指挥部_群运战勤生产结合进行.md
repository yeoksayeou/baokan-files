Yanggu News: The Zhonglou Village in the First District has established a village command post, with cadres having clear divisions of labor and unified use of manpower and animal power. This has resolved the contradiction of combining land reform, wartime service, and spring plowing. In the past, land reform in the village was affected by wartime service tasks, and the masses were afraid of delaying spring plowing. Although the village cadres were exhausted, they couldn't get anything done. After research, a village command post was established, divided into three sections: The supply section is responsible by the village head and eight neighborhood leaders, who mobilize and prepare rice, firewood, cloth, shoes, iron, etc., to supply the district's military stations; the transportation section is responsible by the substitute farming team leader, who controls the village's animal power and uniformly allocates its use (transportation, spring plowing). The village has forty-six head of livestock, thirty-one of which are capable, and are organized into twelve groups for unified deployment and plowing; small livestock do odd jobs, and two rice milling teams are formed to specifically mill rice for the troops; the stretcher section is responsible for mobilizing and organizing stretchers, ready at any time. In addition, the Farmers' Association is specifically responsible for leading the masses to check the emancipation, continue the land investigation, and investigate hidden wealth. In this way, the cadres have clear divisions of labor, manpower and animal power are organized, and the masses' concerns about delaying spring plowing are eliminated, and the enthusiasm for participating in the war has greatly increased. When the district issued a notice to mobilize stretchers, thirty-one young people, including Zhong Jiyu and Baojin, enthusiastically signed up to go to the front line at the mobilization meeting, exceeding the task by seven. Twelve elderly people, including Zhong Guangjun, said, "We are old, we will plow the land at home, and ensure that no land is left uncultivated." The Farmers' Association actively led the masses to investigate land and hidden wealth; in the past half month, the three tasks have been combined and great achievements have been made: (1) Supplying the district's military station with ×10,000 catties of millet, ×1,000 catties of flour, ×1,000 catties of grass, sending out four stretchers, and sending out twenty long-distance carts, providing food and accommodation for more than ×100 soldiers; (2) Investigating forty-eight mu of black land belonging to landlords such as Zhong Guangyue and Zhong Taixiang, calculating and distributing more than 24,000 bricks, digging up sixty-four trees (dismantling more than 40,000 catties of firewood), and a part of hidden wealth; (3) Plowing more than 300 mu of spring land, with the families of soldiers and stretcher bearers being given priority, and all 600 mu of spring land in the village will be completed soon. At present, the enthusiasm of the masses in the village for participating in the war, emancipation, and production is unprecedented, and various organizations are also developing rapidly, including the Women's Federation, which has developed 110 people, and the Sisters' Group, which has 50 people. When Zhong Jiyu, a stretcher bearer on the second expedition, returned home and saw that the four mu of spring land at home had been plowed, and the Farmers' Association had also sent the distributed fruits to his home, and the self-defense队员 had brought water to the tank, he happily said, "Our stretcher bearing is for ourselves, and it is glorious, and the work at home is not delayed, and the fruits are still distributed the same. I think it's okay to go out for another year." (Yanggu People)
