　　Semi-able-bodied Labor Organized for Crash Planting
    Beiyuan Estuary Completes Sowing on Time
    [Xinhua News Agency Jin-Cha-Ji 16th Dispatch] Beiyuan Estuary Village in Ba County, north of the Daqing River, completed emergency sowing amidst intense warfare, with all 900 mu of land sown in a timely manner. The village is close to the Daqing River, and once the ground "re-freezes" after thawing, sowing becomes impossible. However, with the able-bodied men participating in the war, Su Zhaowu, the vice chairman of the village farmers' association, proposed: "Organize, support the front, and carry out crash sowing." Ninety-six people, both fully and partially able-bodied, in the village were organized into eight groups, with the semi-able-bodied working together to cultivate the land while the able-bodied participated in the war. Each group had a plow, and each plow sowed an average of more than ten mu per day. They prioritized sowing for military families, then for their own group, and finally helped the orphaned and widowed, ensuring that all 900 mu of land were sown in a timely manner.

　　半劳力组织起来突击
    北苑口及时完成下种
    【新华社晋察冀十六日电】大清河北霸县北苑口村，于紧张的战争情况下，突击播种，九百亩地均已及时完成。该村靠近大清河，地一“反浆”即没法播种。但正当青壮参战，该村农会副主任苏兆五就提出：“组织起来，一面支援前线，一面突击播种”。将全村全半劳力九十六人混合编成八组，青壮参战，由半劳力合力种地。每组一张犁，每张犁平均每天播种十亩以上，并以先给军属种，再给本组种，然后帮助孤寡办法，使九百亩地都及时下了种。
