　　Cadres Participate in Mutual Aid Separately
　　Concentrate Experience to Promote the Whole Village
　　Xiwu Village, Licheng
　　Changing Leadership Methods
　　[This newspaper, Taihang, 28th dispatch] Cadres of Xiwu Village in Licheng held a meeting on the 18th of this month to review their leadership methods, and unanimously felt that in the past, they had wasted a lot of work time, and the work was not done well. There are three main reasons: First, the central work is separated from the systematic work. Zhang Deqin, director of the Armed Forces Committee, said: "In the past, I only did armed work, regardless of the central work, and everyone did not care about the armed work. As a result, the armed work was not done well, and the central work was not done well." Second, the cadres were flying all over the place, unable to grasp the key points. Village Chief Song Shuangxian said: "Our village is three miles long from north to south and has five natural villages. I participated in the meetings of every mutual aid group. I was really flying all over the place, wasting work time and not achieving any results." Third, there are too many meetings. Political Director Sun Laohu said: "In the past, we held mass meetings at every turn, and each meeting lasted for most of the day. The cadres talked about one thing, and I talked about another. The masses were not interested in the meetings, and later they came later and later, and the time wasted became longer and longer. Now it is the busy spring season, and the militia is participating in the war, and manpower is very scarce. We can't do it without changing the method!" How to solve this problem? Starting from saving manpower and doing a good job in production, everyone discussed three specific methods: First, unified leadership, with division of labor by street and responsibility. The political director and deputy village chief are fully responsible for leading production, and the remaining cadres are divided according to the streets. Whoever is in that area should not only lead production but also lead military training and various systematic work. If it is not a major problem for the whole village, it should be resolved by street. Second, each main cadre must go deep into leading a mutual aid group, create experience, and promote the whole street, instead of running around randomly. Third, going to the people's school should be according to the area (street), generally not a full village gathering. Village cadres gather once every five days to study work, and mutual aid team leaders and group leaders meet once every seven days to summarize the production of the previous seven days and arrange the production of the next seven days. One meeting only solves one or two important issues, and it must be done so that people arrive early, the meeting is quick, and it ends early, without wasting any time. (Fan Renqing)

　　干部分头参加互助
    集中经验推动全村
    黎城西仵村
    改变领导方法
    【本报太行二十八日电】黎城西仵村干部于本月十八日开会检讨领导方法，一致感到过去误工既多，工作也没有搞好。归纳起来有三个主要原因：一、中心工作与系统工作脱节。武委主任张德芹说：“我过去是只做武装工作，不管中心工作，大家也不管武装工作，结果武装工作没做好，中心工作也没做好。”二、干部满天飞，抓不住重点。村长宋双贤说：“咱村南北三里长，有五个自然村，那个互助组开会我也参加，真是满天飞，误了工也没有做出成绩来。”三、开会多，政治主任孙老虎说：“过去动不动就开群众大会，一开总是大半天，干部们你谈一套，我谈一套，群众对开会不感兴趣，以后开会来的就越迟啦，误时间就越长；现在正是春忙，民兵又去参战，人力很缺，不改改办法可不行呀！”怎样解决这个问题呢？大家从节省民力做好生产出发，讨论出三个具体办法：一、统一领导，按街分工负责。政治主任、副村长负全面领导生产责任，其余干部按街分工，谁在那个地区不但领导生产，同时要领导练武及各系统工作，不是全村大问题，就按街解决。二、每个主要干部一定要深入领导一个互助组，创造经验，推动全街，不要乱跑。三、上民校要按地区（街），一般不全村大集中，每五天村干部集会一次，研究工作，七天开一次互助队长、组长会，总结前七天生产，安排下七天生产。一个会只解决一两个重要问题，要做到来的早，开的快，散的早，不浪费一点时间。（范任卿）
