Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 3rd (delayed dispatch) After Hu Zongnan's troops scurried to Yanchang and Yanchuan, they scurried to Qingjian County on March 31st. The strength of Hu's troops invading this time reached ten brigades, divided into three routes: two routes from Yan'an to Yanchuan and Qingjian, and one route from Linzhen Town (northwest of Yichuan) to Yanchang and Yanchuan, resulting in a complete failure. This was the second armed parade by Hu's troops after scurrying into the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Liberated Area.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 6th Hu Zongnan's troops, who have been encroaching on the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Liberated Area, turned west from the Yanchang, Yanchuan, and Qingjian line with ten brigades of troops starting on April 1st. On April 3rd, they scurried to the Yongping and Wayaobao (i.e., Anse) line. This time, Hu's troops were even more cautious in their westward scurrying. His ten brigades were divided into three routes, forming a square formation each 30 to 40 li long and wide. They avoided main roads and specialized in taking mountain trails, advancing only 20 to 30 li each day. Most of them slept in the open, and were extremely exhausted. But the result was still fruitless. Hu Zongnan himself has now arrived in Yan'an to personally direct this unprecedentedly stupid operation. The people of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Liberated Area have now been enthusiastically mobilized, transforming from ten years of peaceful life to wartime life. The work of clearing the fields is done well, so that Hu's troops cannot find food anywhere. The scale of guerrilla warfare is extremely broad, and the people are unanimously confident in thoroughly annihilating Hu Zongnan.

　　陕甘宁坚壁清野彻底蒋胡军游行到处扑空
    【新华社陕北三日电】（迟到）胡宗南军窜抵延长、延川后，于三月三十一日窜抵清涧县城。此次胡军窜犯兵力达十旅之众，共分三路：两路由延安向延川、清涧，一路由临真镇（宜川西北）向延长、延川，结果完全扑空。此为胡军窜入陕甘宁解放区后之第二次武装大游行。
    【新华社陕北六日电】四月一日起，窜犯陕甘宁解放区之胡宗南军，由延长、延川、清涧一线，以十旅兵力回头西窜，四月三日窜抵永平、瓦窑堡（即安塞）之线。胡军此次西窜，较已往更加谨慎，其十个旅分为三路，形成一个长宽各三四十里的方阵。不走大路专走大山小路，每日前进二三十里。大部露宿，疲惫已极。但结果仍毫无所获。胡宗南本人现已到延安亲自指挥此种亘古未有的蠢笨作战。陕甘宁解放区人民现已热烈动员起来，由十年来的和平生活转变为战时生活，坚壁清野的工作做得好，使胡军到处找不到饭吃。游击战争的发动规模极为广大，人民一致有信心要彻底消灭胡宗南。
