　　【Report from Jinan, Hebei, April 4th】The female detachment of the Second Regiment of Instructors of Liberated KMT military officers is composed of the families of company-grade officers of the KMT's 104th Brigade. They are all from Sichuan Province and are actively engaged in study and production. They happily reunite with their husbands every weekend. They express infinite gratitude for the generous treatment from the school. Qiao Haiyan, wife of the political instructor of the Second Company of the 212th Regiment, once worried that no one would take care of her during childbirth. However, when she stayed in the hospital during her confinement, the doctor examined her three times a day and provided her with sufficient white cloth, cotton, white flour, eggs, meat, and money. She said with emotion, "The Communist Party is truly like my reborn parents; I haven't suffered any grievances at all." The wife of telegraph operator Li Fuchun said, "I used to think that the Eighth Route Army would definitely be impolite to us. When we were first captured, we always stayed close together. Now I realize that the people's army is full of people with high morals, which is completely different from the shameless KMT army." Li Fuchun's wife is from Sichuan. Because the KMT government levied taxes and conscripted funds, her family's land was sold, and her parents wandered to Hubei. Ten years ago, her husband was seized and forced into the army, and her younger brother starved to death. She said, "After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, I fully expected the whole family to reunite. Who knew that Chiang Kai-shek had no humanity and started a civil war, I don't even know if my parents are dead or alive! If it weren't for the Eighth Route Army, even my husband and I would be finished."

　　解放蒋军眷属备受我方优待
    【本报冀南四日电】解放蒋军军官教导第二团女分队，均系蒋军一○四旅尉级军官眷属。彼等均四川籍，正在积极学习与生产。每届周末即和丈夫欢聚。彼等对校方的优渥待遇表示无限感激。二一二团二连指导员乔海燕夫人曾经顾虑分娩时无人照管，但在产期住医院时，医生一日看问三次，发给她足够的白布，棉花，白面，鸡子，肉和钱，她感动的说：“共产党真是再生的爹娘，一点委屈也没受过。”电务员李甫春的爱人说：“我先以为八路军一定对我们不讲礼貌，才被俘时俺们总是形影不离。现在认识了人民军队里都是有高尚道德的人，和无耻的蒋介石军队大不一样。”李甫春的爱人是四川人，因为蒋政府征讨派款，她家宅地卖光，父母流浪到湖北，十年前丈夫被抓走当兵，弟弟饿死了。她说：“抗战胜利，满指望全家团圆，谁知蒋介石没有人心，打起内战来，不知父母是死是活！若不是八路军，连我夫妻都完啦。”
