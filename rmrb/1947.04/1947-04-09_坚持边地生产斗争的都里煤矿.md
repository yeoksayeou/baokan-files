　　Duli Coal Mine Persists in Border Area Production Struggle
　　Xiaotan
　　Duli Coal Mine is located in Duli Village, the second district of Anyang. Before the enemy occupied Guantai, a three-section small boiler and a small high-lift car with a capacity of less than half a ton were installed here for mining. At that time, there were fifty or sixty workers, and they could mine fifty tons of coal every day, supplying fuel to the masses in the second district of Anyang and the area east of Rencun in Lin County.
　　On November 11th last year, the enemy occupied Guantai and built a "tortoise nest" in Xijishan Village. Duli is twenty miles north of Guantai and only eight miles east of the Jishan stronghold. Only a low mountain ridge separates them. The Kuomintang-puppet troops and the local reactionary armed forces (还乡团) frequently operated on the ridge. Under the enemy's ravages, all the large and small coal mines on the northeast sides of the ridge were shut down. The Duli Mine was also forced to thoroughly prepare for war with its machinery and tools. The masses in Anyang, who used to burn coal, could no longer buy coal to burn. In order to solve the difficulties of the masses, the Duli Coal Mine began to dig small kilns manually after the machines were thoroughly prepared for war. In less than a month, the two new shafts they had dug found coal. During this period, the enemy still constantly operated on the west side of the ridge. During the Gregorian New Year, the enemy harassed Duli for six consecutive days from the 1st to the 6th and looted more than 1,000 baskets of coal. But even under these circumstances, they had to produce coal every day, and the output sometimes exceeded 50 tons. The enemy was tenacious, but they were even more tenacious than the enemy. From November last year to now, the enemy has attacked Duli no less than twenty times. Apart from being robbed of more than 1,000 baskets of coal and a steel wire rope, the Duli Mine has not suffered any other losses, and their fuel supply area is even larger than before the enemy occupied Guantai. In persisting in the border area struggle, they have gained several experiences:
　　1. Through the mobilization of war preparation and the tense action of rushing to transport machinery and materials, a firm concept of fighting the enemy was established in the minds of the staff. In the war preparation, they not only safely transferred their own heavy machinery and materials but also unconditionally helped the Liuhegou Flour Company and the Coal Mine Company to rush to transport materials. From Zhao Shuanying, Yang Sentang, the manager and deputy manager, to all the staff, no one did not participate in the labor of moving materials. Without thorough war preparation, it would be impossible to persist in production in a war environment.
　　2. Unite ourselves and fight the enemy together. They took advantage of the Spring Festival holiday to launch an inspection movement to eliminate the large and small gaps between leaders and those led, and between staff. Then, they turned to a commendation movement and the selection of models, praising the enthusiasm of the masses and inspiring the staff's class friendship and responsibility for work. When the enemy crossed the mountain ridge and surrounded Haojing Village on February 17th, only three miles away from the Duli Mine, there were still nine workers down the shaft. The worker Yue Zhongjing and the leader Yang Licheng grabbed the winding handle and pulled the nine workers below completely up to the wellhead in one breath, safely transferring them. Without a high degree of class friendship and responsibility, losses would be unavoidable in an emergency.
　　3. For the tools and materials needed by the mine, take one piece at a time, take a little at a time. Unused materials are completely placed behind. The things in use are assigned to each person to be responsible for. As soon as the enemy crosses the mountain, each person carries their own tools to transfer.
　　4. The leaders often study the enemy's activities and master the enemy's patterns to arrange working hours. For example, when the enemy first came out to operate at dawn, the staff would get up early and eat, pack their luggage first, and if there was no movement after breakfast, they would start working until 12 o'clock at night. Later, the enemy changed to surrounding and突击 at night, and the workers changed to digging coal during the day and guarding and resting at night. They also maintained close contact with the village headquarters militia, exchanged information, and jointly guarded.
　　5. They created a reverse ladder to facilitate workers' access. Previously, workers went up and down the well shaft by sitting on rope loops, and only two or three people could go up and down at a time. In an emergency, it was difficult for all the workers to come up. After rescuing nine workers in an emergency on February 17th when the enemy surrounded Haojing, they studied ways to transform the well shaft to facilitate workers' access. They had carpenters make nine short ladders, which zigzagged from the bottom of the well to the wellhead. Workers went up and down the well like going up and down stairs, and changing shifts did not delay time. It was much more convenient than sitting on rope loops.
　　Although the Duli Coal Mine is located in a border area only eight miles away from the enemy, and the enemy is constantly clamoring to go to Duli to rob workers to open coal kilns in Lingdong, they have not been able to achieve the goal of destroying the Duli Mine in the past four months. On the contrary, the Duli Mine has grown stronger and stronger in persisting in the border area production struggle. Now, the fourth new shaft they are digging is about to find coal, and they plan to reach a daily output of 100 tons of coal before the rainy season this year.

　　坚持边地生产斗争的都里煤矿
    小潭
    都里煤矿在安阳二区的都里村，在敌人侵占观台以前，这里安设了一个三节小锅炉，一部不到半吨的小高车，进行开采。当时有五六十个工人，每天能挖到五十吨煤，供给安阳二区及林县任村以东一带的群众燃料。
    去年十一月十一日，敌人侵占了观台，又在西积善村盖下了“王八窝”，都里北距观台二十里，东距积善据点仅八里，中间只隔一线不高的山梁，蒋伪军还乡团经常到山梁上下活动，在敌人蹂躏下，山梁东北两面所有大小煤矿都停工了，都里矿也被迫将机器工具彻底备了战。一贯烧煤的安阳群众，便买不到煤烧。都里煤矿为解决群众的困难，就在机器彻底备战后，开始用人工打小窑，不到一个月时间，他们开凿的两个新井都透了煤。这中间敌人还是经常不断的到山梁西面活动。过阳历年时，敌人从一号到六号一连六天到都里骚扰，并抢走一千多筐煤，但是在这种情况下，他们每天都要出煤，并且产量有时还超过五十吨，敌人顽强，他们比敌人更顽强。从去年十一月到现在，敌人向都里进攻不下二十次，都里矿除了被抢一千多筐煤，及一条钢丝绳外，再没有受到任何损失，而且他们的燃料供给区域，比敌人占领观台前还要大。在坚持边地斗争中，他们得到几点经验：
    一、经过备战的动员，经过抢运机器资材的紧张行动，在职工人员的思想上树立了坚决的对敌斗争观念。他们在备战中不但安全转移了自己笨重的机器资材，还无条件的帮助六河沟面粉公司、煤矿公司抢运资材，从赵拴英，杨森堂正副经理以下，所有职工人员，没有一个人不参加搬运资材的劳动，如果没有彻底的备战，就不可能在战争环境中坚持生产。
    二、团结自己，共同对敌。他们利用春节休假，发动了检查运动，消除了领导与被领导间，职工相互间的大小隔阂。接着又转入表功运动及评选模范，表扬了群众的积极性，启发了职工人员的阶级友爱及对工作的负责精神。当二月十七日，敌人翻过山梁包围了好井村，距都里矿仅有三里的时候，窑下还有九个工人没有上来，把工岳忠敬及领杆杨里成二人抓住搅把，一口气把下面的九个工人完全搅上井口，安全转移。如果没有高度的阶级友爱及负责精神，在紧急情况下，是难免受到损失的。
    三、矿厂矿井所需工具物料，用一件拿一件，用一点拿一点不用的资材物料，完全放在后面。现用的东西，各自分工负责，敌人一过山，各携带各人工具转移。
    四、领导上经常研究敌人活动规律，掌握敌人规律，安排作工时间。如敌人开始是拂晓出来活动，职工人员是起五更吃罢饭，先打好自己行李，早饭后如没有动静，即开始做工，一直到夜十二点。以后敌人改变为夜间包围突击，工人改为白天挖煤夜间警戒休息。并与村指挥部民兵密切联系，互通情报，共同警戒。
    五、创造了倒梯，便利工人上下，以前工人上下井甬，都是坐绳套，一次只能上下两三个人，如遇紧急情况，工人很难全部上来，自二月十七日敌人包围好井，在紧急情况下，抢救出九个工人后，他们即研究改造井甬，便利工人上下的办法，让木工制造了九节短梯，从井底曲折盘接到井口，工人上下井像上下楼梯一样，换班也不耽误时间，比座绳套上下便利多了。
    都里煤矿虽然处在距敌人仅有八里的边沿地带，敌人经常嚷叫着到都里抢工人到岭东开煤窑，但是四个月来，他们并不能达到破坏都里矿的目的相反，都里矿在坚持边地生产斗争中，却日益发展壮大了。现在他们新凿的第四个井又将透煤，他们计划在今年雨季以前，要达到每天一百吨煤的产量。
