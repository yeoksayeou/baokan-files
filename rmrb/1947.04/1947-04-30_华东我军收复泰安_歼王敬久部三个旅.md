Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, urgent dispatch dated 28th: The East China People's Liberation Army annihilated three brigades of Chiang's 72nd Division (original army) in one fell swoop, liberating the city of Tai'an. The East China People's Liberation Army Headquarters has just issued Public Communiqué No. 16 stating: On April 22nd, the People's Liberation Army began to counterattack Chiang's 72nd Division, which had occupied Tai'an. By the morning of April 26th, the battle was completely resolved, annihilating the 72nd Division Headquarters, the entire 34th Brigade, the New 13th Brigade (less one regiment), and one regiment of the New 15th Brigade within the city walls of Tai'an. The headquarters of the division's New 15th Brigade and another regiment, along with another regiment of the New 13th Brigade, reinforced Tai'an from the west side of the Jinpu Railway on the morning of April 26th. When they reached Mount Tai, they were again surrounded by the Liberation Army. The remnants of the New 15th Brigade were annihilated, and the Liberation Army is expanding its victory. Note: The 72nd Division is a Sichuan army, originally under the Wuhan headquarters, now under the command of Wang Jingjiu of the 27th Army. This year in March, the New 13th Brigade was renamed the 113th Brigade, and the New 15th Brigade was renamed the 115th Brigade (original division). The division commander, Fu Yi, was dismissed by Chiang Kai-shek for failing to encircle and suppress the New Fourth Army in the Central Plains. The division invaded northern Ji-Lu-Yu this year in March, and occupied the city of Tai'an in early April.

Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, dispatch dated 28th: A unit of the East China People's Liberation Army achieved victory in eastern Linyi. On the 19th, the 512th Regiment, 513th Regiment of the 171st Division, and the 516th Regiment of the 172nd Division of Chiang's Gui系 (faction) 7th Army advanced on the Wu Jiahou, Jiang Jiahou, and Sha Ling areas east of Jiaolong Bay (more than seventy li southeast of Linyi City), and were ambushed by a unit of the Liberation Army, killing and wounding over 200 Chiang soldiers, including battalion commanders. On the 20th, a company of Chiang's 83rd Division invaded Guo Jiawan (more than forty li northeast of Linyi City). The Liberation Army immediately counterattacked, and the enemy, unable to withstand the attack, retreated in disarray towards Xiang Gongzhuang. The Liberation Army suffered one minor injury and killed over 30 Chiang soldiers. Note: Chiang's 7th Army was transferred from southern Shandong to the Jinpu Railway in late February to reinforce Jinan, arriving in Teng County and Zou County. On April 13th, it moved from Baiyan to Yicheng, and on the 15th, it "suppressed" east of the Shu River from Dabu (north of Tancheng). Chiang's 83rd Division cooperated with the 74th Division in attacking Fei County from Linyi on March 27th and was transferred back to Linyi in mid-March.

Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, dispatch dated 28th (delayed): On the morning of the 17th, a unit of the East China People's Liberation Army completely annihilated the search battalion of the 52nd Brigade of Chiang's 28th Division near Baita埠 (forty li west of Haizhou) on the eastern section of the Longhai Railway. In addition to those killed and wounded, over a hundred were captured alive. (Attached picture)
