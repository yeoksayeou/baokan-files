　　Jize's Li Machang Overcomes Labor Shortage
    Absorbing Military Dependents into Mutual Aid Production

    [Reported by this newspaper] Li Machang Village, Fourth District of Jize County, is implementing the county's new method of land tilling on behalf of military families (reported in this newspaper on March 10th). Two supplementary measures have been added: (1) Absorbing the full and semi-labor force of military dependents to participate in cultivation; (2) Guaranteeing that each military dependent receives the harvest from six mu of land per person. When the discussion of land tilling on behalf of military families began, the masses raised the issue that the village has a total of 31.70+ mu of land. The full and semi-labor force of the whole village is equivalent to only 110+ laborers. On average, each person cultivates 30 mu of land. If most of the 9.80+ mu of land belonging to the 37 military dependent households in the village were to be cultivated on their behalf, it would be impossible to cultivate it all. After discussion among the masses, it was unanimously decided to supplement the above two measures. Then, according to this standard, the amount of land to be tilled on behalf of each military dependent household was studied. For example, one military dependent household in the village has five people and 31 mu of land. There is only half a male laborer in the family. Calculated based on one laborer cultivating 30 mu of land, after cultivating 15 mu themselves, the remaining 16 mu are allocated to mutual aid for tilling on their behalf. Another military dependent household has only one person left, with 18 mu of land. Although they cannot cultivate the land themselves, after participating in mutual aid group production, according to the land-labor grain distribution method of 60% to land and 40% to labor, they can still receive grain equivalent to 10.8 mu of land, which already exceeds the standard of 6 mu, so no land will be tilled on their behalf. As another example, Wang Wenying's mother, a military dependent, now has only two people in her family, with a total of 18 mu of land and no labor force. It was decided to till 4 mu on her behalf, and the remaining 14 mu will be used to participate in the mutual aid group. According to the four-six grain distribution method, these 14 mu of land can yield grain equivalent to 8.4 mu of land. Adding the 4 mu tilled on her behalf, the total is 12.4 mu, which is exactly equal to the 6 mu standard. After such household-by-household research and evaluation, a total of 2.27 mu of land was evaluated as needing to be tilled on behalf of the military dependents. This is about one-third less than last year, and it is more reasonable, so the masses and military dependents are very satisfied. (Xi Min)

    [Reported by this newspaper from Jize] All the village cadres of Xiaozhai Village in the Second District examined the reasons why the work of supporting the military and giving preferential treatment to families of revolutionary soldiers had not been done well in the past: 1. Most of the military dependents did not participate in the mutual aid groups, and the land tilled on their behalf was not fixed, often relying on conscripted laborers to till the land in rotation. 2. Village cadres did not supervise, inspect, or attach importance to leadership. After the examination, they unanimously resolved to do a good job in supporting the military and giving preferential treatment to families of revolutionary soldiers in the future. The methods are: 1. Based on the average labor force of the whole village, each laborer in the village must cultivate 18.7 mu of land. The number of mu to be tilled on behalf of military families should be determined so that military dependents can participate in mutual aid groups in a planned way. If the labor force is judged by the group to be less than a full labor force, the amount of land they cultivate themselves should be reduced according to the group's evaluation. The firewood and grain from the land tilled on their behalf should be given to the military dependents. 2. Accurately count the number of military dependents. The group will not manage those military dependents with a labor force; those without a labor force will be the responsibility of the group they participate in. 3. The village office will print tickets for labor in land tilling on behalf of military families and distribute them to each group. The group leader will be responsible for counting the labor.

　　鸡泽李马昌克服劳力不足
    吸收军属互助生产
    【本报讯】鸡泽四区李马昌村实行该县代耕新办法中（载于三月十日本报），补充两条办法：（一）吸收军属的全半劳力参加耕种；（二）保证军属每口人得到六亩地收获。开始讨论代耕时，群众提出：该村共有卅一顷七十多亩地，全村全半劳力折合计算才有一百一十多个劳力，平均每人种地已达三十亩，如把全村三十七户军属九顷八十多亩地中的大部分再代耕起来，实在无法耕种。经过群众的讨论一致决定补充以上两条办法。然后，即按这个标准，将各户军属应代耕土地的数目研究出来。如该村有一户军属，全家五口人，地三十一亩，家里只有半个男劳力，一个劳力种三十亩地计算，除自种十五亩外，下剩的十六亩拨给互助代耕。另一户军属家里只剩下了一口人，现有地十八亩，自己虽不能耕种，但参加互助组生产后，按照地六劳四的分粮办法，依然可以收到十亩八分地的粮食，已超过六亩的标准，就全部不给代耕了。再如军属王文英娘，家里现在只有二口人，共十八亩地，没有劳动力，决定给他代耕四亩，下剩的十四亩参加互助组。按照四六分粮的办法，这十四亩地可以收到八亩四分地的粮食，加上代耕的四亩，共合十二亩四分，恰好等于六亩的标准。经过这样一户一户的研究与评议，共评出应代耕的土地两顷二十七亩，比去年减少了约三分之一，并且比较合理，群众和军属都极满意。（西民）
    【本报鸡泽讯】二区小砦村全体村干检讨了过去优军工作没有做好的原因：一、多半军属没有参加互助组，代耕土地也没固定，经常是派夫轮流代耕。二、村干没督促检查与重视领导。经检讨后，一致决心，今后把优军工作做好。办法是：一、按全村所有劳力平均，全村每劳力须种地十八亩七分，确定代耕亩数，使军属有计划的都参加互助组，劳力经组内评议，不及一整劳力，即按组内评议减少其自种亩数。代耕部分柴粮一律交给军属。二、军属数清。军属们有劳力者组内一律不管；无劳力者参加那组即由那组负责。三、代耕计工，由村公所制印代耕工票，分散到各组，组长负责计工。（慕琦）
