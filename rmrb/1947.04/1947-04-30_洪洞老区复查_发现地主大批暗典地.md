[This article was] transmitted by Taiyue [Correspondent] on the 28th of this month: A feudal tail has been discovered again during the re-examination in the old district of Hongdong. The County Farmers' Association has called for a widespread tracing of old roots. In these areas, a vigorous land redistribution movement took place last year. On the surface, landlords and feudal rich peasants seem to have disappeared, but a considerable amount of land remains hidden in various ways: (1) Secretly mortgaging [land]. For example, in Shangzhai Village, in the Second District, peasants recovered another 219 mu of land during the re-examination of feudalism, of which 65 mu were secretly mortgaged, mostly to middle peasants. In Fangdui Village, in the First District, 180.02 mu of land were re-examined, of which 147 mu were secretly mortgaged. (2) Fake sales, fake accounting, and giving gifts. According to an investigation of several feudal rich peasants in Likai Village, they concealed a lot of land in this way. For example, Wang Dengdi falsely sold 36 mu of land to his relatives before the struggle, and also allowed his cousin, Zhao Qingfu, to take away 8 mu through false accounting. When Kong Guiren was struggled against last year, he allowed his uncle Kong Ligang to falsely account for 20 mu of land, half a threshing ground, and two cave dwellings. His uncle falsely accounted for half of a courtyard. A village cadre, [name censored], falsely accounted for 30 mu of land and a horse. Kong Xianfu lured village cadres. When the masses wanted to struggle against him, he gave the village cadres 15 mu of land in advance. Li Xingsan and others gave more than 20 mu of land to the masses to win them over so that they would not struggle against him. Based on this investigation, the County Farmers' Association has specifically called on all villages to conduct in-depth inspections of landlords' land and eliminate false mortgages and false sales.

　　洪洞老区复查
    发现地主大批暗典地
    【本报太岳二十八日电】洪洞老区复查中，又发现封建尾巴。县农会号召普遍追老根，这些地区，去年皆经过轰轰烈烈的分田运动，地主与封建富农从表面看来已没有什么了，但在各种方式隐蔽下，仍遗留不少土地：（一）暗中出典。如二区的上寨村，在复查封建中，农民又收回土地二百十九亩，其中有六十五亩都是暗典又多是典给中农。一区坊堆村，复查出一百八十亩零二分土地，其中暗典地即有一百四十七亩。（二）假卖、假算账、送人情。根据里开村几个封建富农的调查，他们用此种方式隐蔽了很多土地。如王登弟在斗争前假卖给他亲戚地三十六亩，又让其表兄赵清富，假算账算走八亩。孔贵仁在去年斗争时，让其叔伯兄弟孔立刚假算去土地二十亩，半个场，两孔窑。其叔父假算去半座院。村干部×××假算去土地三十亩，马一头。孔宪富利诱村干部，当群众要斗争他时，他预先送给村干部十五亩地。李兴三等赠送群众二十余亩地，拉拢他们不要斗争。县农会根据此种调查，特向各村号召深入检查地主土地，取消假典假卖现象。
