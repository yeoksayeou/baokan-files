　　[This newspaper, Taiyue, 30th dispatch] Jiao Wubao, a special-class hero of the Liberation Detachment, has made great contributions in the Northern Henan Campaign. On the evening of the 17th of this month, a unit of the Liberation Detachment crossed the Yellow River to the south and launched a surprise attack on the enemy at Xiwu in Xin'an. At the mobilization meeting in the company, Jiao Wubao volunteered to join the daring assault team. That night, under the cover of our artillery fire, the daring team members crossed the roaring Yellow River, shaken by artillery shells, climbed the other bank, and advanced towards the enemy at Xiwu. Jiao Wubao's mutual aid team of daring assault members was responsible for the frontal attack. He led his team members Liu Genming and Zhang Maimai to rush into the village first. The enemy defending the area abandoned their position and fled under the explosion of their grenades. Xiwu was captured in one fell swoop. In this battle, Jiao Wubao's mutual aid team captured four enemies and seized five guns. Jiao Wubao alone captured two enemies and seized two guns. When summarizing the battle, the soldiers unanimously agreed that Jiao Wubao's contribution was the greatest.
    [This newspaper, Taiyue, 30th dispatch] All the commanders and fighters of the first battalion of the 403rd Regiment on the Taiyue front have joined the meritorious service movement to defend Chairman Mao. When the soldiers heard the news that Chiang's army had occupied Yan'an, they all said angrily: "Chiang Kai-shek is like a slaughtered rooster. He has to struggle before he dies; good, let him struggle, and when his troops are dispersed, we will eliminate him, making it easy for him to get in but difficult to get out!" Soldier Wei Shouyi said: "We must obey orders well, listen to commands, and carry out tasks, and the enemy will not be difficult to eliminate." Battalion Commander Xu, who has participated in the revolution for more than ten years, publicly read out his resolution: "Resolutely obey orders, listen to commands, abide by discipline, and in battle, live and die with the soldiers; in life, share the hardships with the soldiers." Clerk Xie Darong said: "I am not fighting in the front, but I will personally deliver tea and meals to everyone on time during the battle." Qin Defu sewed bullet pouches and was rushing to sew bayonet pouches. The instructor asked him, "Why are you sewing all day long?" He replied, "To win the battle, I have to prepare myself."
