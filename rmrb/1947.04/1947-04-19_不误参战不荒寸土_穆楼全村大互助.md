　　Not Delaying Enlistment, Not Wasting an Inch of Land
    Mutual Aid in Moulou Village
    [Reported by this newspaper] In Moulou Village, Kunwu Third District, during the land reform movement, poor peasants each received four mu of land. Currently, it is the spring plowing season, and there is also a need to complete war service tasks. Everyone feels that they cannot live well until the war service is completed and Old Chiang is driven away. However, they are unwilling to leave an inch of the newly distributed land uncultivated. Everyone hopes for a good autumn harvest. The farmers' association held a meeting to discuss how to solve this problem. After discussions in each group, gathering opinions, and researching, they found a good method: the entire village formed thirteen mutual aid teams, each with seven households, equipped with two carts, two plows, two sets of harrows, and four livestock. Each team has a standard area of one qing and seventy-odd mu, and seven able-bodied young people. Forty members of the village militia and five village cadres who can go on missions are divided into five shifts (stretcher teams) for rotation. Assuming that half of the people are on duty, each team can regularly have two people at home working (excluding the elderly and children). Assuming that one-third of the total land is planted with autumn crops, which is sixty mu, two plows and harrows can complete four mu per day. Together with hauling manure and other work, spring plowing can be completed in half a month. There are five military dependents' families in the village, who are taken care of in five mutual aid teams, while other teams take care of those who are away on duty more often. They propose to ensure that not an inch of land is wasted, and the elderly and children complete household chores. The village cadres are also assigned work: the militia captain leads the first stretcher team, the village chief and public security officer lead the second team, the village instructor leads the third team, and the head of the farmers' association and the deputy village chief lead production.
    [Reported by this newspaper] After the land was distributed in Yanggu First District, several mass turn-over meetings were held, and the enthusiasm had just been stirred up when it was disrupted by war service. The masses were flustered, the cadres grabbed randomly, and the major inspection for the turn-over of the peasants ended in vain. Later, the leadership decided to set aside one day, and on March 18th, held a peasant congress of the Second, Third, and Fourth Sub-districts to solve this problem. At the meeting, a display of floating wealth, silver dollars, and suitcases, attracted much attention. Women representatives from two villages participated in the presidium, and the masses felt it was a new scene. When the villages discussed the current work, Zhonglou reported on the method of combining war service, major inspection for the turn-over, and spring plowing into one. Their method is: 1. The War Service Command has three groups under it: Supply, Transportation, and Stretcher. The Supply Group is responsible for the supply of firewood, grain, and fodder, and is the responsibility of the village chief and the eight neighborhood chiefs. The Transportation Group is responsible for dispatching vehicles and is the responsibility of the acting plowing team leader. The Stretcher Group is the responsibility of the militia cadres and must also send a shift of able-bodied men every day to listen to instructions and guide the army. 2. The Spring Plowing Team is responsible by the elderly, providing manure and harrowing the land. The twelve teams of cattle that volunteered will first do work for the military dependents and the able-bodied men who provide stretchers (all of whom volunteer), and then plow the land well and plant seedlings for each household. 3. The Turn-over Inspection Committee is led by the farmers' association cadres to conduct a major inspection for the turn-over. Wu Tang reported on organizing women's work. Their experience is that farmer members should take the lead in mobilizing their own women to join the association and support the women. Peng Zhuang reported on the major inspection for the turn-over. At the end of the meeting, Comrade Guo Dengqi introduced the Wang Senlou's heart-to-heart meeting, calling on all villages to hold this meeting, to pour out the bitterness in their stomachs, and to turn-over comfortably (JiluYu Sixth Military District Xiaobao).

　　不误参战不荒寸土
    穆楼全村大互助
    【本报讯】昆吾三区穆楼村，土地改革运动中，贫农每人分到四亩地。目前正值春耕，又需要完成战勤任务，大家觉得不完成战勤不打走老蒋没法过，可是新分了土地，也不肯荒一寸土，大秋一定要耩上才有指望，农会里开会讨论如何解决这一问题，经各小组讨论，集合意见研究，找到了好的办法：全村组成十三个互助组，每组七户，配备两辆大车，两张犁、两盘耙、四俱牲口，每组合标准地一顷七十余亩，青壮年七人。全村壮丁自卫队四十个，能出差的村干五个，共分五班（担架班）轮流。平均按一半人出差计，每组可经常余二人在家作活（老少年不在内），按种大秋全地数三分之一计，六十亩，两张犁耙，每日可完成四亩，加上拉粪等活半月可完成春耕。村里有五家军属，分到五个互助组里照顾，其他组照顾出差多的。他们提出保证不荒一寸土，老少年完成家里零活。村干也分了工，自卫队长带领担架第一班，村长公安员带领第二班，村指导员带领第三班，农会长、副村长领导生产。
    【本报讯】阳谷一区土地分下去以后，曾开过几次群众翻身大会，情绪刚轰起来，就被战勤打乱了，群众手忙脚乱，干部乱抓一把，农民翻身大检查，大部落了空。后来领导上决心抽出一天时间，在三月十八日开了个二、三、四小区的农民大会，解决这个问题。这天会场上布置了浮财展览，银元、皮箱，很使人注意。有两个村的妇女代表参加了主席团，群众更认为是个新场面。当分村讨论当前工作的时候，钟楼报告了战勤、翻身大检查、春耕三位一体结合进行的方法，他们的办法是：一、战勤指挥部下设供给、运输、担架三个组。供给组管柴粮草的供给，由村长及八大邻长负责。运输组管出车，由代耕队长负责。担架组由自卫队干部负责，还要每天派出一班壮丁专听候给军队带路。二、春耕队由老年负责，出粪耙地，有自报奋勇的十二犋牲口先给军工属、出担架的壮丁（都是自动出的）做活，再给各户都把地耕好，把苗种上。三、翻身检查委员会由农会干部领导翻身大检查。吴堂报告的是组织妇女工作，他们的经验是农会员起模范动员自家妇女先入会，给妇女撑腰。报告翻身大检查的是彭庄。会的末了，郭登起同志介绍了王森楼的谈心会，号召各村都开这个会，把肚子里的苦水都要倒出来，翻身要翻舒坦（冀鲁豫六分区晓报）。
