   Jiang's Troops at Zhuzhuang "Present Offerings"
    A Prelude to the Yubei Campaign

    On the eve of the unfolding Yubei Campaign, our Ren Cun unit's Third Detachment marched all night and arrived at Zhuzhuang, Xiuwu, at dawn. Opposite us, facing Wangzhen, was the enemy's 59th Regiment of the New 3rd Division. The enemy was clearly confused. Upon seeing the sudden appearance of the Eighth Route Army before them, they had a fantastical idea, actually ordering their troops stationed in En Village to come and surround and "annihilate" us.

    Our soldiers were digging fortifications when the enemy's 3rd Battalion came fiercely from the front, with heavy artillery fire. The comrades of the 9th Company calmly stuck close to the walls of the village, waiting until the enemy was only thirty meters away before launching a sudden counterattack. The first line of the enemy collapsed, rolling and crawling away.

    Then came the second attack. A long line of skirmishers advanced, forming an encirclement from northwest to southeast in an instant. Everyone still waited for the enemy to approach before unleashing a volley of gunfire. Comrade He Xiguang of the machine gun 2nd Squad brought out the skills he had learned in the Shagangpu battle, sweeping down five or six enemies with a burst of bullets. The enemy screamed and retreated again.

    The enemy regimental commander was enraged and personally directed three cannons and four heavy machine guns, using them to cover and threaten the soldiers to charge again and again.

    At this time, the enemy from En Village also arrived, but were greeted and forced to retreat by our First Detachment.

    Here, outside Zhuzhuang, the enemy soldiers could neither advance nor retreat, so they had to lie on the ground and wait to be beaten; this kind of formation has an idiom in the Ren Cun unit called "presenting offerings." The soldiers playfully said, "Look! The enemy is 'presenting offerings' to us again."

    About forty meters from the village, behind a dilapidated house, the enemy's three machine guns were howling. Comrade He Xiguang was furious, aimed twice, and shot the enemy machine gunner face up to the sky. The other two quickly fled. Leaving behind a machine gun and several enemies, Comrade He Xiguang's eyes turned red. He couldn't let the enemy escape. As soon as the enemy showed their heads, he fired two shots, preventing the enemy from moving a single step.

    The battle lasted until after 3 PM. At this time, our 3rd Company outflanked them. The battalion commander ordered a charge. Song Fengzu, the platoon leader of the 2nd platoon of the 8th Company, took the lead. Soldier Gao Tian took off his clothes and pounced on the enemy's two machine guns behind a dung pile from the thorn bushes. Then his squad also caught up. The enemy turned their heads and ran away quickly. Those who couldn't run were caught by him with their guns.

    Battalion Commander Yan shot down four with a bang. Instructor Jia of the 9th Company did not relax his shooting. Even Company Commander Jia, with only one arm, swept down several with a machine gun. In this battle, the enemy suffered more than one hundred casualties.

    After the victory, the comrades became even more excited and began to welcome the great battle of Yubei. (Yan)

    朱庄边蒋军“上供”
    豫北大战斗的一个小序曲
    这是豫北大战役展开之前夕，我们任屯部队三支队行了一夜军，于拂晓赶到修武朱庄，对面待王镇就是敌人新三师五十九团。敌人显然在发昏，对于这突然出现在他面前的八路军，产生了奇想，竟命令他驻恩村的部队，一同来包围“歼灭”我们。
    我们战士们正在挖工事，敌人第三营便从正面汹汹而来，同时炮火大作，九连同志们沉着的贴在寨墙边，直等敌人相距三十米达时才猛然一阵还击，敌人第一线连滚带爬的就溃散了。
    接着第二次的进攻又来了。一长列的散兵跃进着上来，一瞬间由西北而东南，摆成包围的形势。大家仍然是等待敌人接近时，再一阵排枪，机枪二班贺喜光同志拿出沙岗铺战斗的本领来，一梭子弹扫倒五六个，敌人惨叫着再次溃退下去。
    敌团长激怒了，亲自指挥三门炮四挺重机枪掩护着，威胁着士兵们一次再一次地冲锋。
    这时恩村敌人也赶来，被他们一支队一迎击，便纷纷退回。
    这里在朱庄外，敌人的士兵们既不能进又不敢退，便只好伏在地上等着挨打；这种阵势在任屯部队中有一句成语叫“上供”，战士们俏皮地说：“看！敌人又给我们‘上供’了。”
    离村约四十米达处一所破房后面，敌人三挺机枪怪叫着。贺喜光同志火了，瞄准两下，把敌人机枪射手打个面仰天，那两挺赶快逃之夭夭。丢下一挺机枪，还有几个敌人，贺喜光同志眼红了，再不能让敌人逃掉，敌人一露头就啪啪两下，打得敌人不敢移动一步。
    战斗一直打到下三点。这时我们的三连抄过来了。营长命令冲锋，八连二排副宋奉祖当先冲上去，战士高天把衣服一脱，从刺丛里望着粪堆后敌人两挺机枪扑过去，随后他班的人也赶上，敌人扭头飞快的跑了，跑不动的被他连人带枪抓过来。
    阎营长砰砰扑倒四个，九连指导员打枪不放松，甚至一只胳膊的贾连长架着机枪一下扫倒好几个。在这次战斗中敌人伤亡一百多。
    战斗胜利结束以后，同志们就更加兴奋地开始迎接豫北的大战斗。（燕）
