Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 17th: TASS Moscow dispatch: Spring plowing in various parts of the Soviet Union is reaching its high tide. In the Ukrainian, Stalino and Dnepropetrovsk regions, the sowing of grains has been completed. The cultivated area in the Kuban River Valley, Crimea, Turkmenistan and Moldavian Republics has increased compared to last year. Cultivation has begun in the Siberian Ural Mountains and the Volga region. Millions of farmers are carrying out assaults for a bumper harvest and the improvement of the agricultural economy. Farmers from collective farms in the Novosibirsk region wrote to Stalin guaranteeing to expand the summer cultivated area by 125,000 hectares, develop the achievements of advanced collective farms, and continue through mass socialist competition to achieve a great improvement in the agricultural economy of their region. Farmers and workers of state farms and collective farms in Crimea guarantee to regain their previous glory in the shortest period. They said to Stalin: "We are able to do this because the country supplies Crimea with new machines, and supplies its agricultural economy with machinery and equipment. Collective farms are now standing firmly." Collective farms and state farms in the Moscow region supply the residents of the capital with potatoes and other vegetables, and participate in assaults for a bumper harvest. The advanced districts of the Moscow region guarantee to harvest 200 centners of potatoes and 300 centners of vegetables per hectare this year (note: one centner is about 50 kilograms), and increase production by 28 percent compared with the pre-war period. Flax growers in the Kalinin region are also participating in this assault, vigorously restoring flax cultivation after the war, and many major flax-growing areas guarantee that the Five-Year Plan will be completed ahead of schedule by the end of this year.
