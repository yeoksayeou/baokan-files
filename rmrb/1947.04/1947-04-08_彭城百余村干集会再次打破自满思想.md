　　Pengcheng More Than a Hundred Village Cadres' Meeting Again Shatters Complacency
　　[Our Correspondent in Cixian Reports] After the in-depth movement in Pengcheng Town, starting from the twelfth month of the old lunar calendar last year to the second month of this year, the gains were great, focusing on overthrowing the big feudal, traitor, evil bully, and special agent leaders Wang Lao Zhen, Wang Lao Xiu, Feng Lao Wang, etc. A total of three thousand men and women workers, peasants, merchants, and shopkeepers were organized, with more than 1,700 households receiving benefits, averaging two rooms and two mu of land per person (including the large-scale movement last year). After the distribution of the fruits, the cadres' sentiment showed that the struggle was "almost" over, and they demanded a shift to production. In order to further deepen the movement and completely eliminate feudalism, more than a hundred village cadres were gathered to resolve the complacent thinking. First, discussions were launched, asking each person to first recall their performance in the struggle and to examine how many people were most active in the struggle, completely tearing apart the faces of the landlords. The results of the village inspections showed that only 140 people from the five villages were truly aware of the struggle. Others, although organized, attended the meetings, but were not active in expressing opinions, and many did not participate in the meetings or rise up to make trouble and fight. Then, further discussion was guided: "Why are only a few people active? What will be the result if this continues? How can we make the 'backward' people active too?" Everyone reviewed that the reason why the majority were not active was that a few activists monopolized the work, looked down on the backward, and did not have the patience to persuade and mobilize them to work together. They further reviewed that this detachment from the broad masses gave the landlords opportunities to exploit. Everyone believed that if everyone was not mobilized, the landlords would not be overthrown, and they would be opposed by the masses. They unanimously proposed that they must patiently put down their airs and unite all the oppressed people. Then, they discussed: "How many things has each cadre done for the masses, and how great is their contribution?" A comparison of merits was carried out. At the same time, it was proposed: "Take the advantages of others and compare them with your own shortcomings and mistakes." In this way, everyone first boasted of their merits and complained. At the same time, they compared their own shortcomings with the advantages of others. Finally, more than a hundred cadres were determined to carry the movement through to the end, mobilize all the masses, and combine it with the completion of the task of participating in the war.

　　彭城百余村干集会再次打破自满思想
    【本报磁县讯】彭城镇经过去年旧历十二月份开始至正二月份的深入运动，收获甚大，集中打垮大封建汉奸恶霸特务头子王老振、王老秀、冯老望等。共组织起来了男女工、农、市、商三千人，得果实者一千七百多户，每人平均得房二间、地二亩（连去年大运动在内）。经过果实分配后，在干部情绪上表现认为已经斗的“差不多”了，要求转向生产。为进一步的深入运动，彻底消灭封建。所以集中了百余村干部，解决差不多的思想。首先开展讨论，让每人先回忆自己在斗争中的表现，并检查多少人在斗争中最积极，完全给地主撕破了脸。各村检查结果，大家提出真有认识斗争坚决的，五个村只有一四○人。其他的虽组织起来、虽到会但不主动不积极提意见，并有不少人没参加过会，没起来闹斗争。又引导进一步讨论：“为什么只少数人积极？这样下去结果怎样？怎么使‘落后’的也积极起来？”都检讨大多数不积极的原因是少数积极分子包办看不起落后，没有耐心说服动员一块干，并进一步检讨，这样脱离广大群众，给了地主钻空子机会，人人认为不把大家都发动起来，地主斗不垮，自己要遭群众反对，一致提出可得耐心的放下架子，把所有受压迫的人都团结起来。接着又讨论：“每个干部给群众办了多少事，有多大功劳？”进行比功劳。同时提出：“以别人的优点，对照自己有什么缺点和错误。”这样大家先表功，发牢骚。同时以别人的优点对照自己的缺点。最后一百余干部下定决心，要将运动深入到底，把群众全部发动起来，并结合完成参战任务。（戴服劳）
