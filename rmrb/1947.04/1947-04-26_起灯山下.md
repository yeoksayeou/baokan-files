　　Under Mount Qideng

　　Looking south from Linxian County, the small mountain standing far away on the Linxian and Hejian plateau is the famous Mount Qideng.

　　During the Anti-Japanese War, Mount Qideng, once hit by all eighty-eight shells of artillery hero Hu Shengcai under General Liu Bocheng, has recently been continuously visited by young farmers who are raising their eyebrows and fighting to protect their liberation. They wear white towels given by their elders, sisters, and brothers, and new clothes rushed up by their mothers and wives overnight, marching in groups through here.

　　Today, I met two such young farmers again under Mount Qideng. One of them suddenly stopped, concentrating on testing the pen in his hand, making a "squeak" sound continuously. He took out a small notebook from his pocket, wrote something crookedly on it, then carefully wiped the ink off the nib with his index finger, capped it, and put it back in his pocket. Only then did he seem to notice someone nearby, saying shyly, half to me and half to his partner, "Damn it, luckily it wasn't broken!" I knew he was referring to that beloved pen. I nodded in agreement, and then we started talking. He said his name was Hu Qingfu, nineteen years old, and his family of five farmed two mu of land. This time, they "filled in the gaps" to seven mu and were also given some farming tools and furniture. Now was the time to "dig out the roots of the landlords and turn over completely." He flashed the notebook at me, which was filled with phrases like "Down with Little Chiang, Down with Old Chiang," "Do your own thing," and the like. The notebook was made by his wife from the landlord's account book, and a piece of red satin won in the struggle was used as a cover, making it look particularly small and exquisite. The pen was bought by his mother with five thousand yuan of struggle spoils. On the night of his departure, she put it in his hand and said, "Child, go! Be loyal to the country and filial to your family, fulfilling both!" Hu Qingfu deeply remembered how his father was killed by the landlord for five silver dollars. He was determined to kill more enemies on the front lines and use this pen to write a meritorious service letter to his mother.

　　Hu Qingfu's partner was named Shi Zhangbao, from Zhaoguan Village southeast of Mount Qideng. He was said to be a year younger than Hu Qingfu, but shorter by a head. When he heard about the troop expansion, he kept pestering the village cadres, insisting that they let him join the army. The village cadres had no choice but to tell him, "Little Zhangbao, go talk to the district!" Little Zhangbao went to the district office to "register" for the army, but was rejected. He then tried to sneak into the new recruits' group, but was still picked out because he was too young and too short. Little Zhangbao, not convinced, ran to the district chief to appeal. The district chief asked him why he wanted to join the army, and he said, "I lost my parents when I was little and begged for food herding cows. This time, my wife and I got seven mu of land. If we don't protect this good time, who will?" The district chief told him to wait two more years, but he said he couldn't wait. The district chief, seeing that he couldn't get rid of him, deliberately made things difficult for him, saying, "Didn't you discuss it with your little brother?" Little Zhangbao said, "We discussed it a long time ago. My brother said, 'If you want to go, go. Now that we have seven mu of land, I can cook for myself.'" On the afternoon of the sixteenth, when Little Zhangbao, dressed like a groom, brushed past his own land and walked into the ranks, he naively bid farewell to his little brother, saying, "When we defeat Old Chiang, we'll buy a livestock and take good care of our seven mu of land, right?" His brother nodded in agreement, sending him off a long, long way.

　　These masters of the land have poured all their love into the land. To protect it—to protect their own lifeline—thousands of young farmers have rushed to the battlefield to fight a decisive battle with Chiang Kai-shek, the scourge of the people and the overlord of the land. In these years, fathers sending sons, wives sending husbands, and brothers competing to join the army are no longer rare occurrences. This afternoon, under Mount Qideng, I heard an even more touching story: Continuing south along Mount Qideng, in the Linqi District, there is a small village called Fenghuangshan (Phoenix Mountain). There is a middle peasant household with an old mother who is sixty-eight years old. Her child is a mute. The mother has raised this mute since she became a widow at twenty-three, and he has given her two grandsons. Naturally, the old woman cherishes them very much. However, "hearing that Chiang Kai-shek was attacking the liberated areas, she sent her eldest grandson away. This time, she simply sent her eighteen-year-old second grandson, Yan Shangen, to join the army. She said, "Although we are a middle peasant household, we can't survive under the rule of landlords and bullies!" She then began to recount, one by one, how she exposed the accounts that year and was forced to flee east and west by the landlord because she couldn't repay the debt in time. That year, she was suppressed by the landlord. In particular, in 1942, Yan Duocai, a local tyrant and landlord in Linqi, colluded with the Japanese to inflict suffering on the people, burning down her family's five houses, plundering all the grain, and forcing her whole family to beg for food. She was also arrested by the Japanese in the Linqi market and imprisoned in a blockhouse for forty days, beaten half to death!..." Mentioning these things, the old woman always gnashed her teeth in hatred, saying, "Today, I must make my grandson avenge this!" Her mute son, hearing that his second child had joined the army, quickly rushed back from the fields. At first, his thinking was a bit muddled, but after his mother explained it with gestures, he understood and even used gestures everywhere to explain and promote it, giving his child a thumbs up, and instructing him to be a hero in killing the enemy—a meritorious servant of the people. Finally, he laughed happily, and in his loud laughter, he revealed the love of millions of people for the liberated areas.

　　起灯山下
    展潮
    从林县城往南看去，远远屹立在林县、合涧盘地上那座小山，便是有名的起灯山了。
    抗日战争中，曾为刘伯承将军麾下炮兵英雄胡胜才八十八炮炮炮命中的起灯山下，最近几天不断来往着扬眉吐气为保卫翻身而战的青年农民，他们头裹父老、姊妹们赠别的白毛巾，身穿母亲妻子连夜赶起的新衣裳，成群结队地从这里走过。
    今天，我又在起灯山下遇见这样两个青年农民。其中有一个突然站住了，聚精会神试验着他手里那枝钢笔，嘴里不断发出唧唧的响声，从口袋里取出一个小本子，在上面歪歪斜斜地写了些什么，然后又小心翼翼地用食指拭去笔尖上的黑渍，套好，收进口袋里。这时才发现身边有人似的，羞涩地半向我半向他的伙伴说：“×他娘呵，幸亏没有跌坏了！”我知道他是指那枝心爱的钢笔说的，我同意地向他点点头，接着我们就攀谈起来。他说他叫个胡清福，十九岁，五口人种二亩地，这次“填平补齐”了七亩地，又分了些农具家具，当下就是个“刨地主老根翻透身”的时候了。他亮了亮那本子，上面尽写些“打倒小蒋打老蒋”，“自己事情自己干”之类的字句。本子是他女人用地主的账本切成的，还用斗争得来的一块红缎表了个封面，显得特别小巧精致；钢笔则是他娘用五千块钱斗争果实买来的，临别那天晚上揣在他手里说：“孩呀，你去吧！为国为己忠孝两全！”胡清福深深地记得他爹是怎样为了五块大洋被地主通死的。立志要在前方多杀敌，用这枝钢笔给娘写报功信。
    胡清福的伙伴叫石张保，是起灯山东南方的赵官村人。说是比胡清福小一岁，长得比胡清福低一头，这次听说扩军，一直纠缠着村干部，非让他参军不可，村干部没法，只好支应他说：“小张保，你到区上说说吧”！小张保到区署“上名”参军，被验掉了，他又设法混进新战士伙里，结果还是因为年纪小个子低，被挑出来了，小张保不服气地跑去找区长，申区长问他为啥要参军，他说：“俺自小死了爹娘放牛要饭，这回两口人分了七亩地，咱不保护这好时光叫谁来保护？”区长叫他再等二年，他说等不了，区长眼看缠不过他，故意难为他说：“你不跟你小兄弟商量商量？”小张保说：“早就商量好了，俺兄弟说：‘你愿意去你去，这会有了七亩地，俺自己也会做饭吃啦’。”十六日下午，当小张保被打扮得象个新郎似的，从自己地边擦过往队伍里走的时候，他天真地向他小兄弟告别说：“把老蒋打败了，咱再买上一条牲口，好好作务咱这七亩地，对不对？”他兄弟同意地点点头，把他送得老远老远的。
    这些土地的主人，把他们全部的爱都灌注在土地里去了，为了保护它一一保护自己的命根，千百个青年农民涌上了战场，去和人民的灾星土地的霸主蒋介石作决死的斗争，在这样的年月里，父送子、妻送郎，兄弟争相参军，已不是什么稀罕的事了。今天下午，在起灯山下，我更听到这样一个故事：沿着起灯山一直往南走去，在临淇区里有个小村叫凤凰山，有一户中农，老母亲六十八岁了，孩子是个哑巴，母亲自二十三岁熬寡，一直把这个哑巴养大成家，得了两个孙子，老太婆自然是心疼非常，可是“听到蒋介石进攻解放区，她把大孙子打发出来了，这次干脆连十八岁的二孙阎山根也送出来参军，她说：“俺虽说是个中农户吧，在地主恶霸统治下俺也是活不成呀！”便一桩一点地说起她那年揭账，因为一时还不起被地主逼得东奔西藏，那年被地主压了她杠，特别是民国三十一年，临淇恶霸地主阎多财一帮人，勾结日本人苦害老百姓，把她一家五间房子烧了，把粮食刨光了，逼的她一家子要饭，在临淇集上又被日本人抓住了，整整在碉堡里关了四十天，打死反活的！……提起这些事，老太婆总是痛恨得咬牙切齿说：“今天非叫俺孙报这个仇不行！”她那个哑巴儿子听说二孩参了军，赶快从地里赶回来，开始思想有点不通，经他娘打手势说明后，想通了，还到处用手势向人解释宣传，在他孩子面前翘起大姆指，嘱咐他当一名杀敌英雄——人民的功臣。最后他愉快地笑开了，在他那宏亮的笑声里，流露着千百万人民对解放区的热爱。
