　　"Correct Yourself First, Then Correct Others"
  　Feixiang County Cadres Take the Lead in Returning Fruits
    [Our Newspaper's Dispatch] During the land reform review movement in Feixiang, various districts convened village cadre meetings, mobilizing village cadres and activists to return fruits they had gained excessively or through excessive awards. Village cadres, besides harboring ideological obstacles such as "taking credit" and "fear of losing face," also said, "You only tell us to correct our mistakes, but will you correct yours?" This reflected the fact that many cadres above the sub-district level and land reform team cadres had taken fruits for nothing or bought them cheaply. As a result, the return of fruits by village cadres throughout the county did not gain momentum, and the masses were dissatisfied with the village cadres, greatly affecting the reasonable distribution of fruits. The county committee deeply reviewed this situation, clarifying that the key lies in "correcting oneself first, then correcting others," resolutely responding to the Party committee's call, and taking the lead in returning fruits from top to bottom as an example. The responsible comrades of the county have already first reviewed themselves, and this has immediately influenced various county-level organs to return fruits one after another.
    [Another Dispatch] On March 1st, the Third District of Feixiang held a district cadre meeting, where Comrade Wang Zhilin of the county committee conveyed the county committee's resolution. He first reviewed his own wrongdoing in taking fruits from the masses and called on all cadres to return them voluntarily. The cadres all said, "This matter has always been on our minds, and when it is mentioned, our hearts pound. We must return them to the masses so they can be at ease." Director Wang of the mass organization reported that he had worked in the land reform team of the district committee and had cheaply bought some cloth from the Fourth District. Comrade Sun Long of the district committee reported that he had bought a gate in Xiaojin Village, saying, "I will definitely take it down and return it to the masses." He also collected a large shirt and padded trousers that his wife had bought in Xiaojin Village, preparing to return them. Initially, his wife couldn't understand and argued with him several times, but he firmly stated, "No, we cannot take what belongs to the masses!" At the meeting, cadres not only reported the fruits they had bought cheaply or taken for nothing, but also linked them to the review of their ideological roots, leadership methods, and work style.

　　“先正己而后正人”
  　肥乡县干部带头退果实
    【本报讯】肥乡翻身检查运动中，各区曾分别召开村干大会，动员村干积极分子退回多得或过多提奖的果实，村干除存在“居功”“怕丢人”思想障碍外，并说：“光叫俺改错误，你改不改？”反映出很多小区以上及翻身队干部白要和贱买果实的事实。因此全县村干退果实没有动起来，群众对村干不满，大大影响了果实合理的分配。县委会对此深刻检讨，明确关键在于“先正己而后正人”，坚决响应党委号召，自上而下以身作则先行退还。该县负责同志已首先检讨了自身，并马上影响了县级各机关都纷纷退果实。
    【又息】肥乡三区于三月一日召开区干大会，由县委王之林同志传达县委决议。他首先检讨自己要群众果实的不对，号召全体干部自动退出。干部都说：“心里平常就存着这件事，一提起来心里呼呼的跳，一定要退还群众好安心。”群团王主任报出过去在地委翻身队工作，贱买了四区一些布匹，区委会孙龙同志报出在小靳村买了一合门，他说：“一定摘下来还群众。”他对老婆在小靳村买的大衫子、袄裤等，也收敛一块，准备送还。最初他老婆打不通思想，与他吵了好几回，但他坚决表示：“不中，群众的东西咱就不能要！”会上干部不但报出贱买及白要的果实，并联系检讨了思想根源，领导方法和作风。
