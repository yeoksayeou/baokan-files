Blood on the袄 Sleeve
    Battalion Commander Li Wenbo

　　Ever since returning from Shao'erzhai, the patch of blood on my袄 sleeve has made me think of the newly enlisted soldier Yuan Qing＠ who was wounded at the time.

　　During the battle of Shao'erzhai, the troops held out until dawn. After the enemy discovered the target of our small artillery position, they concentrated their firepower on it. Our small artillery group, including myself, consisted of four people, and we were buried in the dirt four times. We crawled out of the dirt time and time again, because the hole we were hiding in was too small to hold four people, especially since it was flattened by artillery shells several times! I ordered the small artillery squad leader to send someone to dig fortifications again, and he immediately sent Comrade Yuan Qing＠ to complete this task. Three steps in front of us, another enemy artillery shell landed, creating a crater as big as a basin. The small artillery squad leader raised his shovel and said, "‘Living Treasure,’ you go dig in this artillery crater!"

　　When I looked back, Comrade Yuan Qing＠ had already jumped out of our fortifications. I told him, "Be careful!" Comrade Yuan Qing＠ started digging, answering me "It's nothing!" However, I was still very worried; bullets were flying back and forth around him, stirring up countless dirt bubbles in front of him. I poked my head out again to tell him to be careful, and I only heard him answer loudly and affirmatively, "I'm not afraid!" Along with his voice, there was a loud bang, and Comrade Yuan Qing＠ rolled back into our fortifications, landing on top of me. When I pulled myself out to look, his arm was already broken, and bright red blood was dripping down along with many bone fragments. White bone splinters were visible from the broken袄 sleeve…

　　I stared blankly at his severed arm, the small artillery squad leader almost shouted. I winked at him, and he seemed to understand what I meant, changing his words to say, "It's okay, let me get you a first-aid kit!" In fact, Comrade Yuan Qing＠ had already seen that his arm was broken, but he calmly told me, "Deputy Battalion Commander, please bandage it for me!"

　　I took the first-aid kit and tore open the damaged part of his袄 sleeve, seeing that one of his arms had completely fallen off, only connected by a little skin on the top and bottom. My hands went weak, and the weaker they got, the less I could bandage it. His bright red blood flowed onto my袄 sleeve, and I didn't dare to bandage it anymore.

　　Comrade Yuan Qing＠ smiled and said to me, "You bandage it, I'm not in pain!" His smile gave me great courage. One first-aid kit wasn't enough to cover it, so the medical officer brought two more to finally bandage it.

　　Comrade Yuan Qing＠ lay in our fortifications, still sitting up from time to time to look around. After a while, I heard him quietly singing something like, "I am wounded for the revolution today, damn Chiang Kai-shek's father and Chiang Kai-shek's mother…"

　　The small artillery squad leader stopped him, saying, "Rest well for a bit, ‘Living Treasure!’ Otherwise, you should go back to rest!" Hearing this, he seemed very anxious and said, "No, I have to watch you eliminate the enemy before I go down!"

　　Now, we have a deeper understanding that a steadfast and brave soldier will not panic under any circumstances. The enemy's artillery shells were still desperately bombarding us, and Comrade Yuan Qing＠ was still constantly observing and monitoring the enemy, telling everyone to be careful.

　　As it was getting dark, the regimental political commissar and director went to comfort him, and he still said with concern, "Chief, please leave here quickly, I'm okay, the enemy is firing fiercely at our army!" He didn't leave the front line until all the enemies were eliminated.

　　Today, when I see the patch of blood on my袄 sleeve, I think of the newly enlisted soldier Comrade Yuan Qing＠ who was wounded at the time. His composure, bravery, and steadfastness truly make me admire him.

　　袄袖上的血
    营长李文波
    打从邵耳砦回来，发现我袄袖上的一片血印，使我想起当时负伤的新战士袁庆＠来。
    邵耳砦战斗中，部队坚持到天明，敌人发现我小炮阵地的目标后，便集中火力向这里轰击，小炮组连我四个人，连着被埋在土里四次，我们一次一次的从土里钻出来。因为我们所隐蔽的坑太小，盛不下四个人，何况又几次被炮弹轰平了呢！我命令小炮班长派人再挖休工事，他立时就派袁庆＠同志完成这个任务。在我们前边三步的地方，又落了敌人一个炮弹，炸成盆大的深坑，小炮班长举过铁锹说：“‘活宝’你就在这个炮弹坑里去挖吧！”
    当我回头看时，袁庆＠同志早跳出了我们的工事，我告诉他：“要注意点！”袁庆＠同志动手挖着工事，回答我“没事”！可是，我还很担心，子弹在他身旁来回乱飞，并在他跟前翻起无数的土泡来。我又露出头来告诉他注意，只听见他大声而肯定的答道：“不怕！”随着他的声音，一声轰响，袁庆＠同志翻身滚回我们的工事来，压在我的身上，我抽出身子一看，他的胳膊已经断了，鲜红的血沿着很多碎骨头滴下来，从被打破的袄袖里露出白色的骨叉……
    我端着他断下来的胳膊发呆了，小炮班长几乎喊叫出来，我向他一挤眼，他像懂了我的意思，改口说：“不要紧，给你救急包吧！”其实袁庆＠同志早看见自己的胳膊断了，他还是很冷静的叫我：“副营长，你替我裹住吧！”
    我接过救急包，把他袄袖的炸破处撕开，见他的一条胳膊完全落了下来，只连着上下一点肉皮，我的手发软了，越发软越不会裹，他那鲜红的血顺着手流在我的袄袖上，我已经不敢裹了。
    袁庆＠同志笑着对我说：“你裹吧，我不痛！”他这一个笑，给了我很大的勇气，一个救急包裹不住，卫生长拿来了两个才算裹住了。
    袁庆＠同志就躺在我们的工事里，还不时的坐起来张望，过了一会，我听见他小声的像唱什么：“我为革命今天受了伤呀，日蒋介石他爹和蒋介石他娘呀……”
    小炮班长制止他说：“好好待会吧，‘活宝！’要不，你就回去休息！”他听了，像很着急的说：“不，我得看着你们消灭了敌人才下去呢！”
    现在，我们更深刻的了解到，一个坚定勇敢的战士，在任何情况下都是不会惊慌的。敌人的炮弹还是拚命的向我们轰击，袁庆＠同志还是不住的观察监视着敌方，叫大家注意。
    快黑的时候，团政委主任去慰问他，他还很关切的说：“首长，你快离开这里吧，我不要紧，敌人对我军打的可凶呢！”直到把敌人全部消灭了，他才下了火线。
    今天，我看到袄袖上的一片血，又想起当时负伤的新战士袁庆＠同志来，他那种沉着，勇敢和坚定，真使我钦佩。
