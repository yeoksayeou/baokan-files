　　Wuan Zhao Village Mule and Horse Fair
  　Over Ten Thousand Farmers Eagerly Purchase Farm Tools
    [This newspaper's Wuan dispatch] The eleventh day of the third lunar month (April 1st) was the main day of the Zhao Village Mule and Horse Fair in the ninth district. This year's gathering seemed particularly lively. Over ten thousand liberated farmers who came to the fair to purchase farm tools were filled with joyful spirits, each with a smiling face. On both sides of the river ditch at the west end of the village, two stages were set up, and the areas below the stages and in the river ditch were packed with people. A group of young farmhands were haggling over the price at a shoulder pole stall. "Brother Piantou, I think 1,600 is a good price. This year, our mutual aid team should all work hard. What's it to buy a new shoulder pole for everyone?" They excitedly planned to put effort into their fields. On a bare patch on the earthen slope, two to three hundred head of livestock were being shown off. The mutual aid team from Shang Nie village bought three large dappled donkeys. Old Man Liu from Chanfang also spent 83,000 yuan to buy a six-year-old black donkey. I asked him, "How many livestock did you have before?" He said, "Alas! How could I afford livestock before? Now, under the leadership of the Communist Party, the poor people have been liberated. I also have land now, and I should buy livestock for farming and breeding!" He revealed a proud smile, continuously stroking the little black donkey's ears. The fair lasted for four days from the tenth. According to incomplete statistics, the transactions of farm tools and livestock amounted to over 5,346,000 yuan (excluding daily necessities, sundries, and food). Two stalls selling manure baskets and sieves sold more than 370 items in one day, earning over 280,000 yuan. A spinning wheel stall was quickly bought out by a group of women, who purchased forty-five wheels in no time. Other items such as baskets, sieves, and winnowing fans were quickly bought up. The farmers' enthusiasm for production is very high after liberation. (Xiu Shi)

　　武安赵庄骡马大会
  　万余农民争购农具
    【本报武安讯】阴历三月十一日（四月一日）是九区赵庄骡马大会的正日，今年这个集会更显得特别热闹。一万多赶会购买农具的翻身农民，都充满了愉快的心情，一个个笑容满面。村西头河沟的两旁，搭着二座戏台，台下和河沟里挤得水泄不通。一伙年青庄稼汉正围着卖扁担的摊子搞价钱，“偏头哥，我看一千六就可以买了。今年咱们这个互助组大家都努一把劲，一个人买一条新扁担还算个啥？”他们兴奋地计划着在自己的地里下功夫。土坡上一块光地里遛着二三百头牲口。上臬村的互助组就买走了三头大花驴。禅房的刘老汉也拿八万三千元买了一个六岁口的黑驴。我问他：“你从前有几个牲口？”他说：“唉！从前那能买起牲口，现在共产党领导穷人翻身啦，俺也有了地啦，该不是要买个牲口闹养种哩！”他露出了得意的微笑，手不住的抚摸着小黑驴的耳朵。大会从十日起开了四天，农具与牲口的成交，据不完全统计约五百三十四万六千余元（日用品、杂货、食物不计在内），两个卖粪筐和箩头的摊子，一天即卖出三百七十多件，得到卖价二十八万余元。一个摊上的纺花车，不一会便被一群妇女买去了四十五辆。其他如篓、箩、簸箩等，都很快就被买光了。农民翻身后生产情绪非常高涨。（秀实）
