    Smashing Chiang Kai-shek's Sinister Plot
    Handan Investigates American Goods
    [Report from this newspaper] Recently, a large number of American and Chiang Kai-shek's goods were found being sold in the markets of Linqing, Xingtai, and Handan. In order to resist these American goods, the Handan Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce recently cooperated with relevant departments to conduct an investigation, which has now been preliminarily concluded. A total of 135 commercial firms were found selling such American goods, and the seized goods are initially estimated to be worth over 23 million yuan in Yichao currency. Cosmetics account for more than 30% of the total. In order to take into account the development of commerce and the prosperity of the market, the authorities have adopted a lenient attitude towards the illegal households. Except for 4% of the illegal and tax-evading luxury goods that are subject to confiscation, most of the others are organized by the commercial firms themselves into a unified special sales office. During the special sales period, the Jinnan Bank provided huge amounts of money to help them switch to other industries. (Bo Ran)
