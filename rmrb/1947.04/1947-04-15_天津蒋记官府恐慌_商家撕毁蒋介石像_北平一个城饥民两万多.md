　　Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 10th. According to people who recently came from Tianjin: The people's guerrilla warfare in the suburbs of Tianjin has spread widely, and the Chiang Kai-shek government in Tianjin is extremely panicked. The Chiang Kai-shek mayor of the city recently publicly declared: To build a 40-kilometer-long, 3-zhang-deep, and 2.8-zhang-wide moat around the city, and to conscript laborers and soldiers on a large scale, demolishing civilian houses. Each cubic meter of earth requires 14,000 yuan to excavate, and the entire project will cost a huge amount, plus the embezzlement by corrupt officials, which will be no less than tens of millions of trillions of yuan. This huge sum of money is pressing down on the citizens, which has aroused the anger of the citizens. Merchants have secretly torn down the Chiang Kai-shek images that were forced to be hung, to show their opposition.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 10th. Beiping News: 20,000 people in Beiping rely on relief to survive every day. According to a report from the Chiang Kai-shek Municipal Government: The population of Beiping is 1,679,176. There are a total of 32 jointly operated public and private porridge and heating factories. From December 1st of last year to February 7th of this year, the number of people eating at the porridge and heating factories was 1,254,939, averaging one-eightieth of the entire population of Beiping every day. At the same time, the amount of relief funds is very small, even compared with the 6 billion yuan engineering cost of the Beiping Chiang Kai-shek "Cultural Relics整理Committee" this year, it is less than one-third. The citizens suffering from hunger and cold are extremely indignant.
　　Also, since the "Emergency Economic Measures" were announced, prices in Tangshan have risen by more than double. Each bag of 44 jin of flour can be sold for more than 300,000 yuan when made into food.

　　天津蒋记官府恐慌
    商家撕毁蒋介石像
    北平一个城饥民两万多
    【新华社山东十日电】据近自津市来人谈：天津近郊人民游击战争普遍展开，津市蒋记官府恐慌异常。该市蒋记市长近公开宣称：要围市挖四十公里长、三丈深、二丈八尺宽之护市外壕，并大肆征夫抓兵，拆毁民房；每挖一方土，须花费一万四千元，全部工程耗费巨大，加之贪官中饱，即不下数千万亿元。这笔巨款压在市民身上，已激起市民愤怒。商家均纷纷暗地将被迫悬挂之蒋介石像撕毁，以示反对。
    【新华社陕北十日电】北平讯：平市每日有两万人靠救济活命。据蒋记市府报告：平市人口为一六七九一七六人，公私合办的粥暖厂共三十二个，自去年十二月一日至今年二月七日，粥暖厂就食人数为一二五四九三九人，平均每日占平市全人口的八十分之一。同时，此项救济用款为数甚微，即与平市蒋记“文物整理委员会”今年工程费六十亿元相比，还不及三分之一。饥寒交迫的市民皆极为愤懑。
    又，自“经济紧急措施”公布以来，唐山物价上涨一倍以上。每一袋四十四斤之面粉，制成食品出售，可得三十余万元以上。
