　　The entire Yangjiashan system in She County began with the leadership making decisions for the masses and cadres separately, breaking down the masses' concerns about "being ineffective and fearing retaliation" on one hand, and breaking down the cadres' thoughts of "being ashamed and fearing downfall" on the other. After mutual deliberation matured, the first meeting was convened - called "A Family Washing Faces and Wiping Away Blemishes." Village Chief Yang Tuchen and Political Director Zhang Yuzhen first made thorough self-criticisms and returned the five mu and eight fen of good land they had privately exchanged for three and a half mu of bad land; other cadres also washed their faces and returned their excess shares of fruits. The cadres' sincere self-criticism moved the masses, who transformed their attitude towards the cadres into genuine care. Yang Yunlai raised a random opinion: "I have another opinion about the cadres. Last winter, when I was allocated a mule, why didn't they give me a cloth bag and a frame?..." Before he could finish speaking, the masses retorted in a confused jumble, "Your opinion is not correct at all. That was decided by everyone, not arranged by the cadres." This time, the face-washing water cleared up, and the cadres felt even more at ease. Yang Niansuo said: "I thought the masses would drag and beat this time, but I didn't expect that the opinions would be so friendly, and even refute the incorrect ones. It's truly insightful. Now I can wash my face with peace of mind!"

　　After correcting mistakes and resolving misunderstandings, the masses began to commend the cadres for their merits. Yang Siting said: "Who can guarantee that they won't make mistakes in doing things? Take me for example, when distributing fruits, I only wanted to get good things, and I even stole a bowl from the storage team; besides, our cadres have made great contributions in the past few years!" At this time, the leadership promptly raised the question: "What contributions have the cadres made after all?" Yang Laolai said: "The struggle last winter was entirely due to our village chief's leadership." Yang Tingjun, an old man in his sixties, said: "Tuchen is truly a hero. Back in the year (1942) when we struggled against the landlord Yang Youshan, wasn't he the one who took the lead? That's why we dared to follow!" Yang Dayan proposed: "Our village's world was opened up under Tuchen's leadership, he should be credited with the first merit." In this way, the masses, according to the size of each cadre's merits, after evaluation, were given credit. Then, the leadership promptly convened the second meeting - called the "Whole Village Great Unity Meeting." First, they expressed their attitudes after resolving misunderstandings. The cadres said: "In the past, we didn't listen to everyone's opinions, we were optimistic in our work, selfish, and took more than our share of the fruits of struggle. We must correct these shortcomings. We guarantee that we will not be pessimistic or retaliatory about the opinions raised by everyone, and we will strive to do things for everyone." The masses said: "In the past, your work style was not good, and it's also our fault for being backward-minded. In the future, we will support you to continue to be cadres and take the lead, and we will definitely follow and work hard!" Finally, everyone solemnly raised their hands to take an oath.

　　After the oath, the whole village unanimously agreed to hang "Merit Plaques" for the cadres, and elected two people to be responsible for supervising the production. Now, the cadres and masses are united as one, carrying out a re-examination and a great production movement.

　　群众评定干部功劳启示干部决心改错
  　杨家山干群大团结
    【本报讯】涉县杨家山整个系一开始，领导上就分别给群众与干部作主，一面打破群众“不顶事，怕报复”的顾虑，一面打破干部“嫌丢人，怕垮台”的思想。相互酝酿成熟后，就召开了第一个会议——名叫“一家人洗脸擦黑”。村长杨土辰、政治主任张玉珍首先作了彻底反省，并退出私自拿三亩半坏地换来的五亩八分好地；其他干部也均洗了脸退出多分果实。干部这样诚心检讨，感动了群众，对干部变成了真正爱护的态度。杨运来乱提意见：“我对干部还有个意见，去年冬天我分的骡子，为啥不给带布袋、架子？………”没等他说完，群众就七嘴八舌的反驳说：“你这意见根本不正确，那是大家决定的，又不是干部包办的。”这一下洗脸水澄清了，干部更放了心。杨年所说：“我数算这一回群众可要拖打，那想到提意见这样和气，不正确的还反驳回去，真是有眼，这可放心好好洗脸吧！”
    改正错误解开圪瘩后，群众就给干部立开功了。杨四亭说：“做事情谁还能保险没个错儿，就说我吧，分果实光想分好东西，结果还偷了保管组的一个碗；再说，咱干部这几年来，功劳可不小呀！”领导上这时便抓紧提出：“干部到底有啥功劳”？杨老赖说：“去冬斗争全凭咱村长领导。”六十多岁的杨廷俊老汉说：“人家土辰真是好汉，那一年（四二年）斗争地主杨优善，还不是人家领头，咱这伙人才敢跟着干！”杨大眼提议：“咱村天下就是土辰领导打开的，应立第一功。”就这样，群众依照各个干部功劳大小，经过评判，均予立功。接着领导上便抓紧开了第二个会议——名叫“全村大团结会”。首先是互相表示解圪瘩后的态度，干部说：“我们过去不听大家意见，工作乐观，自私自利多分斗争果实，这些毛病一定要纠正。大家给提的意见，保证不悲观不报复，努力为大家办事。”群众说：“过去你们作风不好，也怨我们脑筋落后，今后拥护你们继续当干部领头，我们一定跟上努力干！”最后，分别慎重举手宣誓。
    宣誓后，全村群众一致通过给干部挂“功劳区”，并选出两人负责监制。现干群团结一股劲，开展复查与大生产运动。
