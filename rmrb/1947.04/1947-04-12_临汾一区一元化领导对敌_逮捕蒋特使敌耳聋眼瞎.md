　　Taiyue News Agency, 10th: Under the unified leadership, the Linfen First District is carrying out a heroic struggle against "encirclement and suppression." This district is located within a grid network, and enemies from Linfen and Fushan frequently harass it. After Chiang's special agents murdered more than ten cadres and militiamen in our district in February, a deteriorating situation temporarily formed. By mid-February, county and district cadres, rotating warfare teams, and militiamen, in coordination with the county brigade, launched a fierce offensive under the call of "drive away the bandits from outside and catch the thieves at home." The county brigade attacked Houcun stronghold twice, killing and capturing more than 30 members of the "Love the Village Corps." Militia rotating warfare teams implemented "village-to-village joint defense, laying mines everywhere," surrounding and besieging Houcun stronghold. On March 22nd, the Houcun enemy ventured out and suffered six casualties from landmines. At the same time, under the call of "severing the roots of evil," the entire district arrested more than 50 Chiang Kai-shek's army special agents and henchmen, making the enemy "deaf and blind," and afraid to come out and engage in activities. Furthermore, a meeting was held with more than 100 households of stubborn elements, winning over more than 40 households to turn back and call back their sons and brothers. The overall situation in the district has thus been opened up. Land redistribution is now being vigorously carried out.

　　临汾一区一元化领导对敌
    逮捕蒋特使敌耳聋眼瞎
    【本报太岳十日电】临汾一区在一元化领导下，开展反“清剿”的英勇斗争。该区处于格子网内，临汾、浮山敌人经常出扰。二月份蒋特杀害我区干部及民兵十余人后，一时形成恶化局面；至二月中旬，县区干部轮战队民兵配合县大队，在“打走外边的土匪，抓了家里的贼”的号召下，开展猛烈的攻势。县大队两次袭击侯村据点，毙俘“爱乡团”卅余人。民兵轮战队实行“村村联防，处处埋雷”，对锁围困侯村据点。三月二十二日，侯村敌人两交出扰，踏雷死伤六人。同时又在“斩断祸根”的号召下，全区逮捕了五十余个蒋军特务爪牙，使敌人“耳聋眼瞎”，不敢出来活动。并召开了百余户顽属会议，争取了四十余户顽属回头，叫回自己的子弟。全区局面由此打开。现正大力开展分田斗争。
