　　Breaking Through Ideology Through Accounting
　　No Production, No Prosperity

　　On March 11th, Hes順 gathered 600 cadres from districts and villages throughout the county to mobilize production and prepare to launch this year's large-scale production campaign.

　　The cadres who participated in the meeting initially generally had a sense of complacency, believing that since "land to the tiller" had been achieved, and they had land, houses, livestock, and farm tools, everyone had been emancipated and become wealthy. The leadership used the method of calculating family assets to enlighten the cadres. The total annual income of the county was 291,049.71 "da shi" of grain, but the expenditure on cloth alone required 278,960.96 "da shi". This alarmed all the cadres and triggered an accounting craze among them. In the personal and specific accounting in small and large groups, Wang Baolan, a newly emancipated household in Sigou Village, District 1, said: "After emancipation, I thought I had everything, but after calculating, I only have 8.8 shi of grain. With a family of four and a donkey, food, clothing, animal feed, and burdens will cost at least 13.65 shi, leaving a deficit of 4.85 shi of grain." The Political Director of Beiguan said: "Getting land is like setting up the frame of a house and installing a granary; we have to fill it from the outside." The feudal exploitation that was taken away has been returned. To fill the empty frame and fill the granary, we must fight the land and produce well." In this way, everyone understood that without vigorously engaging in production after emancipation, it would be difficult to become wealthy. Emancipation only brought dead things; the upper part is covered, but the lower part is lacking. There's still a big hole in the top of the clothes, unable to withstand wind and rain. The anti-feudal struggle hasn't completely emancipated us. To be completely emancipated and get rid of poverty, we must fight the land and engage in production.

　　After this problem was resolved, another problem arose: Would they dare to produce and become wealthy? It was discovered that: (1) 169 cadres were afraid of making mistakes, having had their family property taken away during the mass struggle, and did not dare to become wealthy. (2) 60 people glorified poverty, fearing that their wealth would be used to fill other people's holes. (3) 126 people complained that work delayed their production.

　　To eliminate these ideological obstacles to production, the cadre issue was addressed first, making everyone clearly understand the cadre policy. Zhang Dongcheng from Songyan said: "The leadership should adopt a 'add oil to the lamp' policy towards cadres who make mistakes in their work, not a 'smash the lamp' policy. Emancipated cadres should not be struggled against in the same way as landlords." The leadership then said to everyone: "The future cadre policy will be to 'add oil to the lamp,' striving for improvement and advancement. If cadres can correct their mistakes, they will not be considered mistakes. We will never treat cadres with the same methods used to struggle against landlords." At the same time, the "anti-'new aristocracy'" of 1942 and the "anti-traitors" of 1944 were reviewed, and the leadership publicly acknowledged their mistakes. This reassured everyone. Then, the discussion turned to what to use to fill the holes and to what extent. Everyone unanimously concluded: "Cut off the tails of feudalism, fill the holes of the peasants, struggle against feudalism, not wealth." The leadership also affirmed and announced: "After the land reform is fully realized, if labor creates wealth, there will be no struggle and no filling of other people's holes." Finally, when resolving the concern that work would delay production, one cadre said: "When we reflect on our past delays in work, it was all because we were sitting in the village office. Work that could be completed in an hour would take all morning in the village office. Cadres don't divide labor; things that one person could do always take several people." In the future, the main cadres in the village will implement a system of rotating shifts, strengthen organizational planning in work, streamline work, and not delay work in the village office, but rather put the work into the fields." Due to the discussion of the above three issues, everyone felt relieved and dared to become wealthy.

　　解除生产思想障碍
    和顺取得初步经验
    二专署办公室
    算账中打通思想
    不生产不能发家
    和顺于三月十一日集结全县区村六百余干部，动员生产，准备开展今年的大生产运动。
    参加会议的干部，首先普遍存在着一种自满情绪，认为耕者有其田实现了，有了土地、房屋、牲畜、农具，大家都翻了身，就以为富了。领导上就用算家当账的办法，启发干部。全县全年总收入共计二九一○四九·七一大石粮食，但光布一项支出就须二七八九六○·九六大石，于是惊醒了全体干部，引起了每个干部的算账热潮。在小组大组的个人具体算账中，一区寺沟村新翻身户王保兰说：我在翻身后，以为什都不缺了，但算了一下只有八石八斗粮，一年四口人，一个毛驴，吃穿、畜料、负担，至少得十三石六斗五升，还亏四石八斗五升粮。北关政治主任说：我们得到土地好比扎起房架安上囤，还得从外往里填。封建剥削走的拿回来了，要想补起空架填满囤，必须和土地做斗争，好好生产。这样，大家明确了翻身后不大闹生产，难发财。翻身只得到死东西，有了上身缺下身，衣服上边还有大窟窿，经不住风吹雨打。反透封建还没翻透身，完全翻透身，摆脱穷困，就要和土地做斗争，进行生产。
    这个问题解决后，接着又发生了个问题，敢不敢生产发财？发现有：（一）干部怕犯了错误，群众斗争捎了家当，不敢发家的就有一百六十九人。（二）怕自己高出填别人的窟窿，以贫为荣的有六十人。（三）嫌工作误工影响生产的有一百二十六人。
    清除这些生产思想障碍，首先抓住了干部问题，使大家明确认识干部政策。松烟张东成说：领导上对干部工作犯错误，应该是采取添油拨灯政策，不应采取摔灯政策，对翻身干部不能与对地主一样斗争。领导上接着对大家说：今后的干部政策，就是采取添油拨灯，努力改进提高，干部犯过能改，就不算过，绝不以对待地主斗争办法来对干部。同时把四二年的反“新贵”、四四年的“反奸”都做了检查，当众承认领导上的错误，这样，大家安下心来了。接着便转入用什填窟窿，填到啥程度的讨论。大家一致结论说：割封建尾巴，填农民窟窿，斗封建不斗富。领导上也肯定的宣布：土地改革完全实现后，劳动发了了财，绝不斗争，绝不填补别人。最后，解决怕误工影响生产时，一个干部说：咱过去的误工，检讨起来都是坐在村公所误了的，一点钟能办完的工作，到了村公所就得坐一上午。干部不分工，一个人能办了的事，总是费上几个人。今后村上主要干部要实行轮流值班，加强工作上的组织计划，紧缩工作，不在村公所误工，把工误到地里头。由于以上三个问题的讨论，大家一致轻松了，也敢发财了。
