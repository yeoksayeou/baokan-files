    Saving Labor and Paying Attention to Incidental Transportation
    Huoxian Commends Model Logistics Personnel
    The People Firmly Believe in Victory
    Fully Support the Patriotic War
    [This newspaper, Taiyue, 19th dispatch] The Huoxian Democratic Government issued a circular to commend the county and district cadres who lead logistics work and pay attention to saving civilian labor, stating: After the enemy occupied the county seat, the coal supply in more than ten villages, including Nanbao, Dusu Gou, and Fancun in the Third District, was cut off, and it was very laborious to cut firewood in the mountains. The district office organized the masses to reopen a shortcut up the mountain, saving the masses twice as much labor in cutting firewood as before, which was warmly supported by the masses in various places. In addition, when our army ambushed the Yan Xishan army's 61st Army on the 7th as they were moving north, the participating masses sent color signals from the foot of the mountain to the top. Comrades Chen Xifang and Liu Katu of our county government mobilized the masses to transport public grain on their return trip, and notified the village offices to consider it as corvée labor. The masses pointed out that they had no pockets, so the two comrades went to nearby villages at night to borrow more than a hundred pockets, and transported more than 3,500 catties of public grain, saving 280 civilian laborers. At the same time, when the county was transporting public grain back from Anze, Comrade Guo Qi of the county government took the initiative to find the troops to discuss having the grain-transporting civilians carry the wounded, saving eleven stretchers and twenty-seven livestock.

    【本报太岳十九日电】霍县民主政府通报表扬该县领导战勤，注意节省民力的政权干部称：三区南堡、杜苏沟、范村等十余村在敌侵占县城后，煤源断绝，上山砍柴又很费工，区公所即组织群众重新开了一条上山捷径，使群众砍柴较过去省工一倍，得到各地群众热烈拥护。此外，我军于七日伏击北上之阎军六十一军时，参战群众从山下向山上送彩号，我县府陈希方、刘喀土两同志即动员群众在回来时捎运公粮，并通知该村公所顶作差务。群众提出没有口袋，二同志星夜至附近村庄借来口袋百余条，捎运公粮三千五百余斤，节省民力二百八十个。同时，本县从安泽往回搬运公粮，县府郭琦同志即主动找部队商谈，由运粮民夫捎走伤员，节省十一付担架，二十七头牲口。
