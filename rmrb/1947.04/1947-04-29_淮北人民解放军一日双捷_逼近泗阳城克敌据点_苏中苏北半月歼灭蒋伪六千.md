Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 27th—The Huaibei People's Liberation Army achieved double victories in one day. One unit captured the Dawangzhuang stronghold, four miles west of Siyang City, on the evening of the 16th. The 1st and 2nd companies of the Chiang Kai-shek Siyang County Security Brigade and all local Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops were annihilated. Eighty-one enemies, including the company commander and below, were captured, and more than thirty were killed or wounded. Three light and heavy machine guns, ninety-seven rifles and carbines, and eight thousand eight hundred and fourteen rounds of ammunition were seized. After the stronghold was removed, the Chiang Kai-shek army in Siyang City was extremely panicked. On the same day, another unit of the People's Liberation Army counterattacked local Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops in Laochen圩 district, more than twenty miles northwest of Siyang City, on the west bank of the Grand Canal, killing and capturing more than sixty enemies, seizing more than forty rifles, and defeating two battalions of the puppet army of Sun Liangcheng, who reinforced from Yanghe Town and Yanghuaji. Currently, the People's Liberation Army in the area is taking advantage of the victory to counterattack the Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops in the Siyang area.

Among them, the Libao battle in Central Jiangsu, which lasted three days and nights and annihilated 2,700 enemies, and the Huji battle in Northern Jiangsu, which annihilated more than 630 enemies in one fell swoop, were the most outstanding.
