(This article was transmitted by Taiyue Xinhua Daily on the 3rd) The Taiyue Xinhua Daily's editorial calling on cadres to return land gains has attracted the attention of the Hongdong County Farmers' Association, and inspections have now begun. Last year, due to unclear thinking on "land to the tiller" among the leadership, the county adopted a method of distributing gains based on problems. This led to a situation in most villages where cadres calculated and benefited first. Gao Dengtang, a cadre from Kongyu Village, single-handedly took all the land and property of landlord Gao Feng＠, which had been accumulated over three generations. Yangshan Village expropriated 108 mu of land last year, but the chairman of the Farmers' Association and a committee member alone received 36.4 mu. In Lingli Village, 30 mu of land was expropriated, and village cadres bought 21 mu. In Shangzhai Village, cadres and activists at the 17th bao (a unit of organization) level received more than 66 percent of the total gains of the village. The only 98 mu of good land in the village were divided up by the chairman, vice-chairman, and village head of the Farmers' Association. After discovering these phenomena, the Hongdong County Farmers' Association immediately began in Shangzhai Village to enlighten cadres and activists, first encouraging them to voluntarily return excess gains. Village cadre Zhao ×× voluntarily returned 8 mu of high-quality land, one kiln, and five houses. The vice-chairman of the Farmers' Association, the village head, and activists followed suit, voluntarily returning excess gains, totaling 99 mu of land, 17 houses, and eight cave dwellings, which were then distributed to the masses who had not yet fully benefited. Influenced by Shangzhai Village, cadres in villages throughout the county have successively returned excess gains to the masses.

　　洪洞村干响应号召
    坚决退出多得果实
    【本报太岳三日电】太岳新华日报号召干部退果实社论已引起洪洞县农会的注意，现已开始进行检查。该县去年因领导上对耕者有其田的思想不明确，采取了按问题分果实的方法，大部村庄都形成干部先算先得。孔峪村干部高登堂一人即“一锅”端了三辈子地主高逢＠的土地财物。杨山村去年斗争出土地一百零八亩，仅农会主席与某常委两人即得了三十六亩四分。岭里村斗争出卅亩土地，村干部买去廿一亩。上寨村十七保干部与积极分子所得果实，也占全村果实百分之六十六以上。该村仅有的九十八亩好地，被农会主席、副主席、村长三人分光了。该县农会发现这些现象后，立即从上寨村开始，启发干部积极分子觉悟，首先自动退出多得果实。村干部赵××自动拿出上等地八亩、窑一孔、房五间，农会副主席、村长、积极分子接着都自动退出多得果实，共地九十九亩、房十七间、窑洞八孔，分给未翻透身的群众。在上寨村影响下，全县各村干部都纷纷将多得果实退还群众。
