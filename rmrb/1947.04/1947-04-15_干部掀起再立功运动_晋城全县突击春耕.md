　　Cadres Launch New Merit Campaign
　　Jincheng County Rushes Spring Planting
　　[Our newspaper, Taiyue, 13th dispatch] Jincheng is overcoming the "fear of getting rich" mentality that is hindering production, and the entire county is currently engaged in a concentrated effort to rush spring planting. The county arranged spring production very early this year, but the villages were slow to act. Upon careful inspection, several ideological obstacles were discovered: (1) Cadres had thoughts of changing shifts and were unwilling to continue leading the masses in production. In the early stages of the land reform movement, many cadres gained or cheaply bought the fruits of struggle. Later, when they were called upon to return them, ideological education was insufficient, which affected the morale of the cadres. When Ning Xiaochun, a cadre in Dongtou Village, returned the fruits, he was unhappy in his heart, and his wife scolded him all day long, even refusing to cook for him. So he said dejectedly, "What have I accomplished in the past few years? It's really disappointing! I can't lead the work anymore!" When the village organized mutual aid teams, he hid and avoided attending meetings. To break through this obstacle, the leadership first summarized the achievements of the county's cadres in leading the masses in the emancipation movement last year, and conducted a major commendation. Then they raised the question, "Although the landlords have been overthrown, can the peasants get rich if they have land but don't produce? Should the cadres establish a second merit for the masses?" After deliberation in the villages, a "new merit" campaign was launched. Niu Laidun, chairman of the Houjiang Village Farmers' Association, announced to the masses, "Although the old wounds have healed, I can't forget the pain I suffered! Last year, I led everyone in the struggle against the landlords, and this year I will continue to lead everyone in production and getting rich! I hope everyone will supervise each other." (2) Many old and middle peasants in some villages have a "cutting chives" mentality, not daring to produce well, and even eating and drinking extravagantly. This is particularly prevalent in the Fifth District. The leadership then called for continued re-examination in conjunction with production, giving necessary care and compensation to those who were wrongly struggled against, so that the middle peasants could produce with peace of mind. After explanation and education, Song Xiaochun and Song Zizhi, middle peasants in Majiang Village, Fifth District, reviewed their mistaken perception of being afraid of struggle over the past year, and started preparing the land early the next day. (3) In large villages and towns such as Chengguan and Dayang Town, although the peasants have been emancipated and obtained land, they despise agricultural production because of rising prices and the low value of grain. A common saying prevails in the area: "Sowing grain and weeding is not as good as going out to carry loads," preferring transportation and weaving to earn some immediate money. The leadership timely proposed the principle of combining agriculture and sideline occupations, explaining that while wearing cloth and eating food are both indispensable, farming and producing grain are still fundamental. Combining the two can solve all living problems and provide savings. After comparing the benefits of agricultural and sideline production, the peasants of Dongtou came up with the slogan "Wandering all over the world and traversing all the mountains is not as good as turning the soil at home!" After breaking through the above-mentioned ideological obstacles, the entire county is sending manure and plowing the land in a vigorous effort to rush spring planting. After holding a mobilization meeting on the 24th of last month, Tianshuiling has formed twenty mutual aid teams, with full and semi-labor forces of men and women rushing to complete the cultivated land in ten days. Since the 20th of last month, the masses in Zhongcun have formed thirteen groups and cultivated 720 mu of land in less than seven days. The North Slope Village plowed more than 230 mu of land in six days. The county government specially issued a circular of commendation, calling on backward villages to catch up.

### 干部掀起再立功运动  晋城全县突击春耕

　　干部掀起再立功运动
    晋城全县突击春耕
    【本报太岳十三日电】晋城克服障碍生产的怕富思想，全县正突击春耕。该县今春布置生产很早，但各村都迟迟不动，仔细检查，发现有几种思想障碍：（一）干部有换班思想，不愿再领导群众生产。土地改革运动初期，一般干部多得或贱买了斗争果实，后来号召退出时，思想教育不够，影响了干部情绪。洞头村干部宁小春退果实时，自己心上本不高兴，老婆又整日怒骂，连饭也不给做。于是很泄气的说：“几年来干了个什么？真败兴！咱是不能再领导工作了！”村里组织互助组，要他去开会，他却东躲西藏不到场。领导上为打破这一障碍，首先总结了去年全县干部领导群众翻身运动的成绩，进行大表功。随即提出“地主虽然斗垮，但农民有了土地不生产能否发家？干部为群众的第二个功要不要立？”各村经过酝酿，掀起“再立功”运动。侯匠村农会主席牛来顿向群众宣布：“旧疮虽然好了，我还忘不了所受过的痛！去年我领导大家与地主斗争，今年还要继续领导大家生产发家！希望大家互相监督。”（二）不少村庄的老中农存在着“割韭菜”思想，不敢好好生产，甚至大吃大喝。五区尤为普遍。领导上乃号召结合生产，继续复查，斗错了的给以必要照顾与补偿，使中农放心生产。五区马匠村中农宋小春和宋子支经过解释教育，检讨了自己一年来怕斗争的错觉，第二天打早便开始整地。（三）城关、大阳镇等大村镇，农民虽然翻了身，得到土地，但因物价上涨，粮食不值钱，轻视农业生产。在该地普遍流行着一句俗话：“种谷锄草，不如出门担挑”，愿意运输、纺织，赚几个现成钱。领导上及时提出农业与副业结合的方针，说明穿布吃饭固然都不可缺，但种地打粮还是根本。两者结合起来，可解决全部生活，并可有积蓄。洞头农民在比较农副业生产那头利大后，提出个口号是“走遍天下串遍山，不如在家把土翻！”突破上述种种思想障碍后，全县正纷纷送粪、犁地，大力突击春耕。天水岭于上月二十四日开过动员会后，已组成二十个互助组，男女全半劳力十天突击完垡地。中村群众从上月二十日起组成十三个小组，不上七天垡地七百二十亩。北坡村六天犁地二百三十余亩。县府特通报表扬，号召落后村迎头赶上。
