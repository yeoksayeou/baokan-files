Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 6th: TASS dispatch (delayed): At the Foreign Ministers meeting on April 2nd, Molotov issued a Soviet statement on Germany's political structure, stating: "The Soviet delegation agrees to accept the British proposal regarding the initial main steps for establishing German political democracy as a general plan. Regarding the issue of the relationship between the German central government and state governments, Mr. Molotov insisted that Germany should be a unified country and disagreed with certain proposals that would federalize Germany. He suggested that the Foreign Ministers meeting consider the Soviet delegation's proposals: 1. Germany's political system must be democratic, and its power organs should be generated on the basis of democratic elections; 2. In accordance with the Potsdam Resolution, establish the German central administrative bodies of the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Industry, the Ministry of Transportation, the Ministry of Communications, and the Ministry of Foreign Trade, as the first step in forming a German provisional government. In order to avoid imposing something on the German people that does not conform to the opinions of German democrats, the opinions of German democrats must be taken into consideration. Mr. Molotov suggested adopting certain democratic elements of the Weimar Constitution in the process of establishing a democratic system in Germany." The second part of Molotov's statement emphasized: "The most appropriate procedure should be to first discuss the above-mentioned main principles on which the German political structure must be based. The U.S. delegation's proposal regarding the procedures for forming a German provisional government, namely, forming a provisional government composed of representatives from various states, is enough to arouse serious doubts, which will make the German people believe that Germany is no longer a unified country and will not trust it. Therefore, it is also impossible to guarantee that Germany fulfills its obligations to the Allied countries." Mr. Molotov stated: The Soviet delegation cannot accept the instructions given by the U.S. delegation to the German provisional government because this proposal violates the Potsdam Resolution and previous Allied resolutions on the Control Council, and will undermine the consistency of the Control Council and the Allied countries' actions in Germany. Regarding the proposal to achieve the main stage of German political democracy, Molotov advocated: First, central management agencies for various economic sectors should be established as a starting step in accordance with the Potsdam Resolution; second, a certain advisory body should be established to assist the Control Council in formulating a German provisional constitution; third, the German provisional constitution should be approved by the Control Council; and fourth, elections should be held in accordance with the provisional constitution and a provisional government should be formed. The composition of the advisory body should not only include representatives of the German states, but representatives from all democratic parties, trade unions, and anti-Nazi groups must participate. The formation of the German provisional government must rely on the Allied Control Council, and must also go through appropriate consultations with representatives of German democrats, trade unions, other anti-Nazi groups, and the states. Only in this way can the German government be a democratic government and reflect the wishes of German democrats. In summary, Molotov emphasized that the procedures in this proposal by the Soviet delegation are completely consistent with the principles adopted by the Potsdam Conference in spirit.

　　外长会议上莫洛托夫发表声明
  　德国政治必须民主
    谴责美国建议违背波茨顿决议
    【新华社陕北六日电】塔斯社讯（迟到）：四月二日外长会议上，莫洛托夫发表苏联对德国政治机构的声明称：“苏联代表团同意接受英国关于建立德国政治民主之最初的主要步骤的提议，作为一般方案。关于德国中央政权和州政权的关系问题，莫氏坚持德国应作为一个统一的国家，不同意将使德国联邦化的某些提议。他建议外长会议考虑苏联代表团的提议：一、德国政治制度必须民主，而其权力机关应在民主选举的基础上产生；二、依据波茨顿决议，建立德国中央行政机构的财政部、工业部、运输部、交通部、和对外贸易部，以作为组成德国临时政府的第一步。为避免不符合于德国民主人士意见的某些东西加诸德国人民身上，对于德国民主人士的意见须予以考虑。莫氏在建议德国民主制度过程中采用威玛宪法某些民主的成份。莫洛托夫声明的第二部分强调说：“最适当的程序，应先讨论德国政治机构所必须依据之上述主要原则。美代表团关于德国临时政府组成程序的建议，即由各州代表组成一个临时政府，足以引起严重的疑虑，将使德国人民会认为德国不再是一个整体的国家，而不对他发生信赖。因而也不可能保证德国尽其对盟国的义务。”莫氏表示：苏联代表不能接受美国代表团建议给予德国临时政府的指令，因为这建议违反了波茨顿以及前此盟国对于管委会的决议，将破坏管委会及盟国在德国行动的一致。关于达到德国政治民主主要阶段的建议时，莫洛托夫主张：第一、应根据波茨顿决议建立对于各种经济部门的中央管理机构作为开始步骤；第二、建立某种咨询机构，以协助管制委员会制定德国临时宪法；第三、德国临时宪法应经管委会批准；第四、遵照临时宪法进行选举并组成临时政府。咨询机构组成，不应单独包括德国各州代表在内，必须一切民主党派及职工会和反纳粹团体都有代表参加。德国临时政府的组成，必须依靠于盟国管制委员会，同样的也须经过对德国民主人士、职工会、其他反纳粹团体以及各州等代表的适当咨询。只有这样，德国政府才是民主的政府，而且才能反映德国民主人士的愿望。莫洛托夫在总结中着重指出：苏联代表团此项建议的程序与波茨顿会议通过之原则在精神上完全一致。
