Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 1st (Delayed Dispatch) Mr. Li Zhitong, Speaker of the Bohai Region Assembly, recently denounced Chiang Kai-shek's breach of contract and release of floodwaters on behalf of the nine million people in the region. Mr. Li began by stating: "The Chiang bandit, before the restoration, repair, and relocation of the old Yellow River course were completed, arbitrarily closed the breach on March 11th. The surging Yellow River swept residents and their property downstream and into the sea. Now, twelve sections of the Bohai Region's dykes are in imminent danger, and 170,000 mu of fertile land have been flooded. In Renhe District alone, over fifty villages have been turned into marshland. The Chiang bandit even sent planes to bomb Putai, destroying the brick dams that the people had just built. In the Jiyang section, planes strafe workers rushing to repair the dykes during the day, and Chiang's special agents shoot and create disturbances at night, leaving residents along the river displaced." Mr. Li emphasized: "If the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) has any intention of helping the people in the liberated areas, it should directly deliver the relief supplies not yet given to the Executive Yuan to the liberated areas to aid the refugees along the river." Mr. Li concluded by calling on the people along the river to resolutely rush to repair the dykes and save themselves, actively support the front lines, and take revenge on the Chiang bandit.
