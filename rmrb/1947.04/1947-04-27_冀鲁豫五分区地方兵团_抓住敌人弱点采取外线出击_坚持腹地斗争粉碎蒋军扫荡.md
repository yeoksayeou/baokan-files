　　[Report from this newspaper's Ji-Lu-Yu correspondent on the 24th] From March 24th to April 5th, the local corps of the Fifth Military Sub-district victoriously smashed the enemy's "mopping-up" and "suppression" operations against the Qi (Bin)-Kao (Cheng) central area. The military region believes that this victory is a successful example of guerrilla warfare and has issued a special commendation and a circular on the anti-mopping-up process and experience of the area, calling on the entire region to learn from it. On March 24th, the enemy's 143rd Brigade on the southern section of the Kao-He Road, relying on the village strongholds (east of Kao),突入 with all its strength into my Fifth Military Sub-district's Qi-Kao center, temporarily setting up strongholds, going out early and returning late every day, advancing in multiple directions and attacking jointly, launching repeated rounds of "suppression" and "mopping-up" operations against us, which were smashed by us. The armed forces of Qi and Kao counties and the Party, government, and military personnel, relying on the masses during the enemy's "mopping-up" operations, fought the enemy with flexibility and bravery, persisted in the struggle in the hinterland, constantly inflicted casualties on the enemy, and consolidated the rural positions. At the same time, they concentrated their forces to launch retaliatory operations from the outside, against the defense area of the enemy's 143rd Brigade and the southern section of the Kao-He line, which was responsible for the transportation line. When attacking Zhuangzhai, the enemy's base for "mopping-up," we wiped out the 17th and 18th Joint Defense units, captured the local tyrant stronghold of Zhang Jun's Tomb, and captured 30 guns and personnel. We cut off more than 30 miles of highway and telephone lines from Nianziying to Mengzhai. The enemy's nest was raided and the supply line was blocked. The main factors for the victory of the Fifth Military Sub-district in this anti-"mopping-up" and "suppression" campaign were: first, the persistence of the struggle in the hinterland, which was tested by strong guerrilla warfare and the powerful suppression of landlords, consolidating the rural positions. Because the rural positions were solid, the burden on the main regiment and county brigade in persisting in the struggle in the hinterland was reduced, enabling them to proactively attack the enemy's key points. In addition, the enemy's fundamental lack of troops, led to a situation where one area was tight while another was slack, and the original defense area was empty when they went out for mopping-up operations. The Fifth Military Sub-district seized this weakness of the enemy and adopted an outflanking strategy, creating an unfavorable situation in which the enemy was attacked from the front and the rear, and both inside and outside, forcing the enemy to shrink back.

　　[Report from this newspaper's Ji-Lu-Yu correspondent on the 23rd] Nanwang × District of the Seventh Military Sub-district is located on the enemy's thoroughfare. Some landlords openly sided with Chiang Kai-shek's troops,倒地倒粮 withholding and hiding grain. After the democratic government executed the reactionary landlord Han Yonglan, the landlords swore to the masses that they would never withhold and hide grain again. Now the markets near the highway have been reorganized, and the land distributed to the masses has been fully sown. A mass intelligence network has been established throughout the district, and the orders from the district can be quickly transmitted to every village. The militia actively combats the enemy. Up to April 8th, they have fought five battles. The district armed work team and the militia repelled 17 armed agents in × Village, protecting public grain and stored guns.

　　冀鲁豫五分区地方兵团
    抓住敌人弱点采取外线出击 
    坚持腹地斗争粉碎蒋军扫荡
    【本报冀鲁豫二十四日电】五分区地方兵团，从三月二十四日起至四月五日止，胜利的粉碎了敌军对齐（滨）考（城）中心区的“扫荡”“清剿”。军区认为此次胜利，是游击战争成功的范例，特通令表扬，并将该区此次反扫荡经过及其经验发出通报，号召全区向其学习。三月二十四日，考荷路南段，敌一四三旅以庄砦（考东）为依托，以全力突入我五分区齐考中心按设临时据点，每天早出晚归，分进合击，夜袭晓攻，反复轮番的对我“清剿”“扫荡”，被我粉碎。齐考两县武装，及其党政军工作人员，在敌“扫荡”中，依靠了群众，灵活英勇的与敌战斗，坚持了腹地斗争，不断予敌以杀伤，巩固了农村阵地。同时集中兵力由外线出击，对敌一四三旅驻防区，及其负责交通线考荷线南段，展开猛烈的报复作战。破击敌扫荡基点——庄砦时，解决敌十七、十八两个联保，攻克土顽据点张君墓，俘缴人枪三十余。砍断埝子营至孟砦等公路电话线三十余里，敌老窝被剿，供应线被阻。五分区此次反“扫荡”“清剿”的胜利，主要的因素：第一腹地斗争的坚持，是经过考验的强有力的游击战争与强有力的压制地主，巩固农村阵地。由于农村阵地坚固，减轻了基干团县大队坚持腹地斗争的负担，得以主动进击敌要害。另外，是由于敌兵力的根本不足，此紧彼松，外出扫荡时原防区空虚。五分区此次抓紧敌这一弱点，采取了外线出击，造成了敌人前后挨打、内外受击的不利情况，使敌处于被动，不得不将头缩回去。
    【本报冀鲁豫廿三日电】七分区南旺×区，位于敌军的过路口上，某些地主曾公开依附蒋军倒地倒粮，民主政府枪决了反动地主韩永兰，地主即向群众宣誓永不倒地倒粮。现公路附近集市已整理起来，群众分得的土地已全部下种。全区建立了大众情报网，区里的命令能很快的传到每个村子。民兵积极活动打击敌人，至四月八日止，共作战五次，区武工队和民兵在×庄打退了十七名武装特务，保卫了公粮及存藏枪支。
