　　[Report from the North Henan Front, April 22nd] After the liberation of Hu Quanlu's old nest by Chiang Kai-shek's puppet troops, the democratic government has established political power in some villages after two weeks of effort. The people of the Junxian Pang Village District (now under the jurisdiction of Qi County), Hu's old nest for ten years, have elected their own village government personnel and begun work. Some villages have launched an anti-traitor and revenge movement; the teachers and students of Wu'an Normal School, who are helping the people here to turn themselves over, have gone to work in nearby villages.

    [Report from the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region, April 24th] Sima Huasheng, the puppet bandit leader who was captured alive by the People's Liberation Army on the 7th when they liberated Caiyuan, a pseudo-stronghold east of Tangyin, has now been executed, much to the satisfaction of the people. Sima became a bandit from a young age and committed all kinds of atrocities such as rape, arson, and murder in Huaxian and other places. After surrendering to the enemy, he often cooperated with the enemy in "sweeping operations" and implementing the "three-all" policy. In 1939, he colluded with the Japanese invaders to "sweep" the ditch area and even dug up the ancestral grave of Liu Hansheng, our anti-Japanese county magistrate. Last year, two demobilized veterans were captured and killed; Cheng Lianxiang and six others from Houchun Village were captured and buried alive. The Chen Chao family of ten and the Cao Bulei family of twenty in Liang'erzhai were all killed. Last November, when Chiang Kai-shek's bandits attacked Huaxian, Sima acted as the vanguard and captured hundreds of able-bodied men east of the Wei River.

    【本报冀鲁豫二十四日电】本月七日人民解放军解放汤阴东伪据点菜园时活捉之伪匪头子司华生，现已处决，人心大快。司逆从小充当土匪，在滑县等地奸淫烧杀无恶不作，投敌后经常配合敌寇“扫荡”，实行“三光”政策。民二十八年协同日寇“扫荡”沟区一带，竟将我抗日县长刘汉升之祖墓掘开，去年秋复员荣誉军人二人被捉去治死；和后村程连祥六人被捉去活埋，梁儿寨陈朝一家十口、曹布雷一家二十口统被杀绝了，去年十一月间蒋贼进攻滑县时，司逆又当开路先锋，并在卫河以东抓壮丁数百名。
