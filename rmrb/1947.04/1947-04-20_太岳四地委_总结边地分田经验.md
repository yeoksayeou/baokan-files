　　Taiyue Fourth Prefectural Committee
    Summarizes Land Distribution Experience in Border Areas
    [This newspaper, Taiyue, 18th dispatch] The Fourth Prefectural Committee summarized the land reform experience in border areas and guerrilla zones, and the following is a summary introduction.
    First, launch mass guerrilla warfare to fight for the defense of land reform: (1) The county and district establish land reform headquarters to unify the leadership of war and land reform. The armed turn-over teams, with the battalion soldiers, militia, and work teams as the backbone, are combined with the land reform headquarters of various joint defense villages. When the enemy does not come, they carry out liquidation and land distribution; when the enemy comes, they conduct joint defense operations. Wherever the land has been redistributed, we must first armed-ly suppress traitors and suppress those who reverse the land redistribution to open up the situation for land reform. Militarily, adhere to the combination of guerrilla positions and political offensive warfare; wherever the militia guerrilla teams go, they distribute slogans and leaflets, or send letters to warn the reverse redistribution elements: those who have reversed the redistribution should return it, those who have not reversed the redistribution should stop; those who have not participated in the enemy's "Self-Defense Corps" should no longer participate, those who have participated should withdraw, leave the local area, or come to the liberated area. (2) Cadres, militia, and the masses are closely combined, cadres do not leave the militia, the militia does not leave the cadres of their own village, and they must share life and death and common hardships with the peasants of their own village. Especially in the most difficult times, they must use their own determination to win to support and embolden the masses, and strengthen the fighting will of the militia and the masses. (3) Cadres who lead armed struggle and land reform in the border areas must have a proper division of labor under unified leadership. Otherwise, they will lose the initiative, confusion will occur, and the leadership strength will be dispersed.
    Second, concentrate strength, advance side by side, inspire the peasants to reclaim land, secretly brew, suddenly break out, quickly develop, quickly fight and quickly divide, from the inside to the outside, gradually advance. All cadres of various systems must be concentrated under the leadership of the land reform headquarters of the district or county, so that they can start in many villages at the same time, advance side by side, echo each other, and create a great momentum. When the peasants see that this is happening in every village, they are most likely to be involved in the movement, and the idea of changing the world is easy to overcome. The masses in the border areas have been ravaged and reversed, and the peasants must be relieved of several ideological concerns: (1) Use our army's large and small victories in the local area to inspire the peasants and strengthen their fighting will; secondly, use the comparison of class forces to inspire the peasants. For example, in a certain village with 190 households, there are only 19 targets of struggle. This comparison dispels the peasants' fear of changing the world. (2) Summarize the experience of anti-reverse redistribution to relieve the peasants' concerns about reverse redistribution. (3) Boldly use the activists among the peasants to inspire the backward elements and lead the general elements. According to the peasants' personal experience and personal suffering in the village, seriously inspire them to want land, and the peasants can quickly take action. (4) Inspire the peasants to unite as one and work together. As long as the vast majority of people are united as one, the peasants' confidence will be strengthened. After the border area has been ravaged by the enemy's reverse redistribution, a few people dare not come forward, so they can visit from door to door and secretly brew, and use the poor and hired peasants' activists who have no land or little land to mobilize those who want land and houses. When the brewing reaches a considerable level, the activists can take the lead and turn into a hot wave of wanting land. At this time, the leadership must seize the opportunity, quickly launch the struggle, quickly fight and quickly divide, fight and divide as you go, so as to avoid enemy sabotage and cool the masses' emotions. As long as the fruits can be distributed to the peasants, the peasants' thinking will immediately turn to defending the fruits. At this time, the peasants can be mobilized to arm themselves to protect their homes and fields. Absolutely do not adopt a simple method of calling for land donation, because this will cause internal chaos among the peasants, make the peasants have an unclear understanding of the feudal landlord class, and make it difficult to raise awareness, and it is also easy to harm the middle peasants.
    Third, unite the majority of the countryside and isolate the main enemies. There should be appropriate and specific policies for all classes: (1) The main fleeing targets of struggle, the reverse redistribution elements, and the renegade elements should be treated separately: First, the big traitors and bullies should be resolutely suppressed and their property confiscated. Second, those who have betrayed the enemy and harmed the people, hated by the masses, and requested to be executed, should be resolutely suppressed and their property confiscated; their families should be given land and houses to maintain their lives. Third, the wavering elements who participated in the reverse redistribution should be given leniency. Fourth, the targets of struggle who are law-abiding and do not infringe on the fruits of the masses should be guaranteed their safety. Fifth, pure citizens who were forced to participate in the stubborn puppet organizations and do bad things, repent and start anew, and do not pursue the past. Sixth, those who escaped and then returned with guns should be treated leniently. Seventh, the targets of struggle who are afraid of struggle, flee, and do bad things and come back should be guaranteed safety and treated leniently. (2) We must resolutely unite the middle peasants to fight together. Take the poor peasants as the backbone, but we must absorb the participation of the middle peasants. In the distribution of fruits, the poor and hired peasants should be given priority to obtain land, houses, and draught cattle, etc., and the middle peasants should also get certain benefits. (3) The land that should be left for the fugitive households should be left according to their class status. Those with poor families should be distributed the land they deserve or other fruits according to their class status. (4) The families of poor puppet stubborn elements should get the benefits they deserve according to their class status, and strive for their political sympathy for us.

　　太岳四地委
    总结边地分田经验
    【本报太岳十八日电】四地委总结边沿区与游击区土地改革经验，兹摘要介绍如下。
    第一、开展群众性游击战争，为保卫土地改革而战：（一）县区成立土地改革指挥部，统一领导战争与土地改革。以营兵、民兵、武工队为骨干的武装翻身队，结合各联防村土地改革指挥部。在敌人不来时清算分田，敌人来了就联防作战。凡经过倒算的地方，要首先武装锄奸，镇压倒算，为土地改革打开局面。军事上坚持游击阵地与政治上的攻心战相结合；民兵游击队所到之处，均散发标语传单，或去信警告倒算分子：已倒算者退回来，未倒算者停止；没参加敌“自卫团”者不再参加，已参加者退出，离开本地或到解放区来。（二）干部民兵群众密切结合，干部不离民兵，民兵不离本村干部，并要与本村农民同生死、共患难。特别在最艰苦的时候，以自己必胜的决心给群众撑腰壮胆，坚定民兵和群众的斗争意志。（三）在边沿区领导武装斗争与土地改革的干部，必须在统一领导下适当分工。否则就会失去主动，发生忙乱现象，以致分散领导力量。
    第二、集中力量，齐头并进，启发农民收回土地要求，秘密酝酿，突然爆发，迅速开展，快斗快分，由内而外，逐步推进。所有各系统干部要全部集中到区或县的土地改革指挥部领导下，这样就可在许多村庄同时下手，齐头并进，互相呼应，声势浩大。农民看到村村如此，最易卷入运动，变天思想容易克服。边沿区群众有被摧残、倒算经验，必须解除农民几种思想顾虑：（一）以我军在当地的大小胜利去启发农民，坚定其斗争意志；其次，以阶级力量对比来启发农民。如某村一百九十户，斗争对象只有十九户。这样对比，解除了农民怕变天的思想。（二）总结反倒算经验，解除农民怕倒算顾虑。（三）大胆使用农民中的积极分子去启发落后分子，带领一般分子。根据该村农民亲身经验及切身痛苦，认真启发其要地思想，农民即可迅速行动起来。（四）启发农民团结一心，大家干。只要绝大多数人团结一心，农民的信心就坚定了。边沿区经过敌人倒算摧残，少数人不敢出头，可挨门访问，秘密酝酿，以无地少地的贫雇农积极分子去发动要地要房的人。酝酿至相当程度，积极分子一带头，即可转入要地热潮。这时领导上要抓紧时机，迅速发动斗争，快斗快分，随斗随分，以免敌人破坏，冷了群众情绪。只要能将果实分给农民，农民思想即刻会转入保卫果实方面来。这时即可发动农民武装保家保田，绝不能采取简单办法号召献田，因为这样会造成农民内部混乱，使农民对封建地主阶级认识不清，不易提高觉悟，也易于伤害中农。
    第三、团结农村大多数，孤立主要敌人。对各阶层要有适当具体政策：（一）对首要潜逃之斗争对象、倒算分子、变节分子，要分别对待：一、大奸霸坚决镇压，没收其家产。二、投敌害民、群众痛恨、要求处死者，坚决镇压，没收其财产；家属应给以维持生活之土地房屋。三、参加倒算的动摇分子予以宽大。四、斗争对象安分守己、不侵害群众果实者，保证其安全。五、纯洁公民被逼参加顽伪组织干坏事者，悔过自新，不究既往。六、逃跑后又携枪回来者，从宽处理。七、斗争对象怕斗潜逃干坏事回来者，保证安全，从轻处理。（二）必须坚决团结中农一块斗争。以贫农为骨干，但一定要吸收中农参加。果实分配应尽先让贫雇农获得地、房、耕牛等，中农也应得到一定利益。（三）逃亡户按成分留给应留之土地。家境贫苦者，按成分分给应得土地或其他果实。（四）贫苦伪顽家属，应按成分得到应有利益，争取其政治上对我同情。
