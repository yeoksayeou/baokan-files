[Reported by this newspaper from Taiyue on the 27th] Many villages in Shimin, Jincheng, Fushan and other counties have veterans and military family members with partial labor capacity participating in mutual aid groups for production. Zhou Fucheng, a disabled veteran in Dongjiashan, Shimin, picks up firewood and manure in the mutual aid group and exchanges labor with others to cultivate the land. After finishing his work, he still has surplus labor, so he declared that his land does not need to be cultivated by others. Wang Mingqing, a veteran in Jiazhai, lacks production experience and asked the youth to teach him well; during rest, he helps the youth learn military knowledge such as throwing grenades and aiming. In Jincheng, military families in Jiaohe mobilized 40 military family women to organize and dig the ground and carry manure. In Beizhai Village, out of eighteen veteran and military family households, only three households have no labor force and need preferential treatment, while the rest are producing on their own. Qingshui held a veterans' conference on March 10th, and 340 households have settled down by relying on their own labor, including Jia Yuyi and Han Yongding, who joined the mutual aid brigade and engaged in vocational labor. The democratic government called on all veterans to learn from them.

　　士敏等县荣退军人暨军属
    参加互助劳动生产
    【本报太岳二十七日电】士敏、晋城、浮山等县许多村庄的荣誉军人及军属等半劳力都先后参加互助组从事生产。士敏董家山荣誉军人周福成，虽残废，也在互助组内拾柴、拾粪和别人变工种地、除做完他的活还有余工，从此他声明自己的土地不用代耕。贾寨荣誉军人王明清，缺乏生产经验，要青年好好教他；在休息时，他帮助青年学习投弹、瞄准等军事知识。晋城焦河军属动员军属妇女组织起四十个人到地里刨地、担粪。北寨村军属荣退军人十八户，仅有三户无劳力需要优待，其余都自己生产。沁水于三月十日召开荣退军人大会，已有三百四十户依靠自己劳动生产安了家，其中贾与义、韩永定参加互助大队，从事职业劳动。民主政府号召所有荣退军人向他们学习。
