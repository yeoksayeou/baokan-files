　　Two-finger rain can be used to the effect of four-finger rain
    Jiang Chongwen, Cixian County Agricultural and Forestry Bureau
    The agricultural heroes and experts from various counties in the Taihang Fifth Military Subdistrict Agricultural Training Class spoke of how two-finger rain can be used to the effect of four-finger rain. This is specially introduced for reference and research in various regions.
    1.  When planting cotton, prepare the cotton fields as early as possible before sowing, apply fertilizer, and plow and level the land. Use a drill to open furrows, and when there is about two-finger rain, quickly sow the seeds. Before sowing, soak the cotton seeds in soda water, take them out and mix them with ash, pile them up and cover them. The next day, the cotton seeds will crack and sprout. Scatter the cotton seeds in the furrows that have been opened, and use a hoe or shovel (a hoe is best) to push the wet soil from the ridge back into the furrow to cover the seeds. This way, the cotton seedlings will emerge easily.
    2.  When planting millet, similarly prepare the land in advance, apply fertilizer, plow and level it, and use a drill to open furrows. After a two-finger rain, soak the millet seeds in warm water and dry them slightly before sowing immediately. The method is as follows: First, use an empty drill to sow along the ridge, pushing the wet soil from the ridge into the furrow. Then, sow in the original furrow, and use a stone roller to compact the soil after sowing.
    3. When planting corn (and other crops by spot sowing), first prepare the land, apply fertilizer, plow and level it. Use a hoe to dig pits, and go to sow immediately after a light rain (soaking the seeds in warm water before sowing). After sowing, use a hoe or mattock to push the surface wet soil into the pits to cover the seeds.

　　二指雨能顶四指用
    磁县农林局  江崇文
    太行五分区农业训练班各县的英雄能手讲的二指雨能顶四指雨用，特介绍以供各地参考研究。
    一、种棉花，在下种前及早把棉田整理好，施上肥，把地耕过耢平。用耧开成沟，等下二指左右的小雨时，赶快去种。种前先把棉籽用大响水浸泡一下，捞出来用灰拌，堆成堆盖住，第二天棉籽就崩嘴出芽，把棉籽撒在已开好的沟里，用锄或锹（锄最好）把垅背上的湿土拥在沟内盖好，这样棉苗容易出土。
    二、种谷子，同样先把土地整理好，施上肥，犁过耢平，用耧开成沟。下了二指小雨，先把谷种用温水浸一下、凉干，马上就去下种。方法是：先用空耧照准垅背种一遍，把垅背上的湿土拥到垅壕，再照准原先开沟的垅壕下种，种后用石砘砘一下。
    三、种玉茭（其他作物点种也同）、先整地、施肥、犁过耢平。用镢把窑刨好，等下小雨后马上去种（种前用温水浸种）。种后用锄或镢把地表面的湿土拥在坑内盖好。
