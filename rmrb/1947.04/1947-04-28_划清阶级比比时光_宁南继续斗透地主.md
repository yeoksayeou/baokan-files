　　Clearly Delineate Class, Compare Past and Present
    Ningnan Continues to Thoroughly Struggle Against Landlords
    [This newspaper's Jinnan dispatch, 26th] In order to thoroughly eliminate landlords, Ningnan County and District leading cadres conducted in-depth investigations and enlightenment in key villages, using the slogan of "Four Comparisons" (compare labor methods, compare houses and land, compare food and clothing, compare the past and today) and "Three Thoroughs" (thoroughly struggle against landlords' land, houses, and hidden wealth). Village women's associations immediately launched in-depth discussions. Members Wang Haizhao and Lu Shun Sheng of Dongwangdong Township said, "We clearly have turned ourselves over, but our houses are still broken and our clothes are tattered. Even though the 'landlords' have been struggled against, their clothes are still much newer than ours. Look at the Lian Shenfu (landlord) family of three; they still have several mu of land, two brick houses, 25 rooms, and all kinds of furniture. The other day, I heard that after the inspection they would be struggled against again, and they moved away five large carts of furniture." They also said, "The Lu Jing family, one person, used to be a big rich man. Now, not only do they have more than ten mu of land, but also two brick houses, 24 rooms, and good storefronts facing the street. They eat well, dress well, and hire people to draw water and farm the land. How can they be considered poor? I think if we don't thoroughly struggle against the landlords, we poor people will not be able to thoroughly turn ourselves over." From the "Four Comparisons", Xiaohekou determined that Li Shu was still a landlord. Before the Japanese surrender, his family had more than three qing of land. Because of increased investment and fear of additional burden, he sold the land and got rid of the hired workers to pretend to be poor. Currently, his family of six still has 60 mu of land. After more than 20 days of discussion and inspection, in the second liquidation, Aixin Village alone cleared out 40 million yuan worth of materials of hidden wealth, and each member could receive more than 20,000 yuan. Dongwangdong Township and Nandin Cao also cleared out hidden wealth worth more than 12 million yuan, and each member could receive an average of about 10,000 yuan. The statistics of land and houses are in progress. Currently, the masses in these five villages are in high spirits and are discussing the distribution of fruits of labor and production issues.

　　划清阶级比比时光
    宁南继续斗透地主
    【本报冀南二十六日电】宁南为彻底消灭地主，县区领导干部特在基点村深入调查启发，用四比（比劳动方式、比房地、比吃穿、比过去与今天），三透（斗透地主土地、房、浮财）的口号，各村农妇会立即开展了深入的讨论。东汪东镇会员王海照、路顺圣说：“咱明像翻了身，还是房破衣服烂，人家‘地主’挨了斗，穿衣还是比咱新的多，你看连申甫（地主）家三口人，还有地几亩，砖宅两处，房二十五间，家具样样全，头两天听说检查出来再斗，又运走了五大车家具。”又说：“路警氏家人一口，过去也是大财主，现在不但有十几亩地，还有砖宅两处，房廿四间，还是靠街的好门面，吃的强，穿的好，吃水种地全雇人，怎么能算穷？我看斗不透地主咱穷人就翻不透身。”小河口从四比中比出李树仍是地主，他家在日本投降前还有三顷多地，因增资，怕负担加级，把地卖了，把雇工去掉装穷人，目下六口人，还有地六十亩。经这廿多天的讨论检查，再次清算中，仅浮财一项艾辛庄即清出值四千万元的物资，每个会员能分两万多。东汪东镇、南丁曹，也清出约值一千二百多万元的浮财，每个会员平均能分万元上下。土地、房屋正在统计中，现该五村群众情绪高涨，正讨论分果实生产问题。
