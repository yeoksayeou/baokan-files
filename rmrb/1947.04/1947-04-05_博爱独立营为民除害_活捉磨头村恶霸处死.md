The Bo'ai Independent Battalion Eliminates Harm for the People; Captures and Executes the Despot of Motou Village

[This Dispatch from Bo'ai] The masses of Motou Village eliminated the great pest Wang Xingtang. After the Jiang army occupied northern Henan, Wang, under the instruction of bandit leader Wang Fengying, was sent back to the village and committed all kinds of evil. He conscripted grain and money from the masses, extorted at will, beat and cursed people, raped women, fired black guns, and opened gambling dens. Day and night, he made the villagers stand guard for him. All men, women, old and young, as well as their family members and relatives, had to listen to him, or they would be beaten. His own brother was cursed relentlessly and beaten beyond recognition for not standing guard for him. In short, since his return to the village, the masses felt as if they were weighed down by thousands of pounds of iron. See! People were gritting their teeth and quietly saying, "The Eighth Route Army eliminates harm for the people, why not eliminate this great harm for us? Let us take off this gloomy hat and see the clear sky!" After our Bo'ai battalion soldiers understood this situation, they put in hard work and captured Wang Xingtang alive. The masses unanimously demanded his execution, even his own brother demanded his death. The democratic government, in response to the people's demand, executed the traitor Wang, and all the men, women, old and young in the village were extremely happy. An old man over sixty years old happily said to everyone, "I have lived so long, and I have never been so happy as I am today." (Liu He, Shunchen)

　　博爱独立营为民除害
    活捉磨头村恶霸处死
    【本报博爱讯】磨头村群众铲除大害虫王兴堂。蒋军进占豫北后，王受土匪头王凤英指使，被派回村，无恶不作，向群众派粮派款，任意勒索。打人骂人，强奸妇女，打黑枪，开赌博场，不分白天夜晚，让村人给他放哨。全村男女老少及家属亲友都得听他的话，不然就要挨打。他的亲哥为了不给他站岗而被骂的狗血淋头，打的不成样子。总之自他回村后，全村群众的头上如同压了几千斤重的铁石一样。你看吧！人们都在咬牙切齿悄悄地说：“八路军为民除害，为啥不给咱把这大害除了？让咱脱了愁天帽，见见青天吧！”我博爱营兵了解此情后，就下苦心，活捉了王兴堂，群众都一致要求枪决，连他亲哥也要求杀他，民主政府应群众之求，将王逆处死，全村男女老少非常痛快。一个年满六十岁的老头子高兴的向大家说：“我活了这么大，从未象今天这样快活过”。（刘荷、舜臣）
