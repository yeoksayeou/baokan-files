　　Bianfu Directs Agricultural and Forestry Bureaus and Farms
    Pay Attention to the Prevention and Control of Animal Plagues
    [Our Newspaper] Recently, animal plagues have been spreading in various regions, especially chicken plague, which is the most severe, with a very high mortality rate. In Wu'an × Village alone, 400 chickens died, with a loss estimated at 200,000 yuan based on chicken prices. If each chicken lays 120 eggs per year, and each egg is valued at 20 yuan, the loss would be approximately 1 million yuan. In particular, the spread of cattle plague will inevitably affect the spring plowing. For this reason, Bianfu has issued instructions to the comrades working in the Agricultural and Forestry Bureaus and farms, requiring them to carry out the prevention and control of animal plagues: (1) Regularly pay attention to investigating and understanding the situation of animal plagues, and immediately combine with local cadres to study prevention and control measures where they are discovered. (2) Go deep into one area, use your scientific knowledge and experience, and attach great importance to the masses' experience in organizing typical demonstration of prevention and control. (3) Organize experience exchange, introduce your own experience at any time, and study and adopt the experience of others. (4) Continuously commend comrades who are active, responsible, have achievements, and are creative in their work, and report to higher levels at any time. (Guang Ju)

    注意防治畜瘟
    【本报讯】近来各地畜瘟蔓延，尤以鸡瘟为最厉害，死亡率甚大，武安×村即死了四百只鸡，按鸡价损失约值二十万元，如以每个鸡年生蛋一百二十个，每个以二十元计，则损失约一百万元。特别是牛瘟蔓延，势必影响春耕，为此边府特对各农林局农场发出指示，要求各农林局农场工作同志进行防治畜瘟：（一）经常注意调查了解畜瘟情况，那里发现了，立即结合当地干部研究防治办法。（二）深入一地，用自己的科学知识与经验，并十分重视群众经验组织防治典型示范。（三）组织经验交流，随时介绍自己经验，研究采用别人经验。（四）不断表扬工作积极负责有成绩有创造的同志，并随时向上反映。（广居）
