　　Tunliu Carries Out Merit Evaluation Campaign;
    Cadres Return Over 700 Mu of Land

    [This newspaper's Taiyue, 14th dispatch] Tunliu, through the evaluation and recording of merits, and the call to establish new merits, has enlightened cadres to voluntarily share more of their fruits [of labor], and has achieved considerable results. As of now, more than two thousand three hundred cadres have voluntarily shared a total of 758 mu of land, 288 rooms, 205 shi of grain, 14 head of draft animals, 183 pieces of clothing, 136 pieces of farm tools, 312 pieces of utensils, and over one million Jiao of Hebei currency to the peasants. When a certain district initially convened a district-wide village cadre merit evaluation meeting, many cadres eloquently reported their merits, and the leadership earnestly praised and recorded them one by one. Afterwards, when it came to examining shortcomings, no one spoke. The leadership said to everyone, "According to everyone's reports, your merits are indeed great, so the masses must not have any opinions about us and should support us!" After a moment of silence, Liu Zongxuan, a cadre from Yuli Village, sadly said that he had taken a cart home without consulting the masses, and the masses had some opinions about him, so he would return it to the masses. Cadres from Xin'anzhuang Village were afraid of punishment, struggle, and losing face, and dared not examine themselves. After the leadership gave assurances, they all confessed their shortcomings. The leadership further guaranteed everyone an opportunity to establish new merits. The cadres of each village then successively confessed their errors of obtaining, buying cheaply, or cleverly seizing the fruits of the struggle through various means, leading to disunity with the masses, and were determined to go back and return them. After a period of ideological struggle, the cadres of Yuli Village said, "Since it is to voluntarily share the fruits to help everyone turn over, what face is there to lose?" The leadership timely enlightened everyone to "add merit upon merit", which achieved very good results. After the cadres returned to their villages, they successively returned the over-obtained fruits, improving the relationship between the masses and the cadres. After solving the problem of over-obtained fruits in the Second District, they are now calling on cadres to actively lead peasants to support the front line and production, and continue to establish merits for the people.

　　屯留经过表功运动
    干部退地七百余亩
    【本报太岳十四日电】屯留以表功、记功，号召再立功，启发干部匀出多分果实，已获不少成绩。截至目前两千三百余干部先后已匀出土地七百五十八亩，房屋二百八十八间，粮食二百零五石，耕畜十四头，衣服一百八十三件，农具一百卅六件，用具三百一十二件，冀钞一百余万元，分给农民。某区开始召开全区村干部表功大会时，许多干部滔滔不绝的报告自己的功劳，领导上一一认真表扬记功。以后提出检讨毛病时，却没人说话。领导上向大家说：“照大家的报告，确实功很大，那么群众一定对咱们没有意见，应该拥护咱们了！”经过一阵沉默，峪里村干部刘宗选很难过地说出他没有通过群众，推回家里一辆车子，群众对他有些意见，回去要退给群众。新安庄村干部因怕处分、怕斗争、怕丢人而不敢检讨，经领导上做了保证，都说出了自己的缺点。领导上更保证给大家再立功的机会。各村干部便接二连三的说出自己以各种办法多得、贱买、巧取斗争果实，致与群众闹不团结等错误，下决心回去退出。峪里村干部经过一番思想斗争后说：“既然是匀出果实帮助大家翻身，那还丢什么人？”领导上及时启发大家“功上加功”，收得很好效果。干部回村后，即纷纷退出多得果实，改进了群众与干部关系。二区解决了多得果实问题后，现又号召干部积极领导农民支援前线与生产，继续为民立功。
