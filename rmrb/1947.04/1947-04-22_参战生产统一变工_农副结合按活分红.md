Unified Labor Exchange for War Participation and Production; Combination of Agriculture and Sideline Occupations, Profit Sharing Based on Work

[This dispatch from our newspaper's correspondent in Licheng] The First District convened an enlarged meeting on April 10th, attended by 657 people, including village cadres, heroes, activists, and primary school teachers from the entire district, to discuss the ideological demands and understanding of the peasants after their emancipation. During the discussion, the peasants reflected their current urgent demands as follows: (1) They demanded to get rich through production, especially the newly emancipated impoverished peasants, who demanded it even more urgently. For example, one village in Nancun added twelve mules after emancipation. (2) Women demanded further development of the textile movement, improvement of technology, and upgrading of tools, to achieve self-sufficiency in clothing, selling cloth but not cotton. Small-scale textile factories were promoted to further advance textile work. (3) Actively participate in the war to eliminate Chiang Kai-shek and eradicate the old roots thoroughly. This demand was universal. For example, Zhao Geng'er from Lizhuang repeatedly requested to participate in the war. (4) Reduce the number of meetings to free up time for production. In short, everyone's general demand was to immediately carry out large-scale production and sideline textile production. At the same time, the difficulties and ideological obstacles to carrying out the large-scale production movement were discovered: (1) Labor shortage, lack of confidence in spring plowing. (2) The problem of disconnection between war participation support and production. After emancipation, the militia actively demanded to participate in the war, which was a good thing, but it also generated a waiting mentality. People did not engage in production, using preparation for war participation as an excuse, and actually waited specifically for substitute labor compensation. Another problem was that the combination of large-scale construction and support was not well coordinated, which also affected production. For example, the construction of a bridge in Qiaojiazhuang did not pay attention to the combination with production, and statistics showed that it wasted twelve labor days in one day. (3) Several ideological obstacles to carrying out the spring plowing movement: 1. The wasteful and hedonistic idea of living one day at a time. For example, Zhu Jiangyi from Shangguihua confessed that after emancipation, he had the idea of being gluttonous and lazy, and spent all the more than 20,000 yuan he had been allocated. He excused himself with the idea of having enough food and clothing, forgetting about production. 2. Fear of getting rich, resulting in not actively developing production and maintaining the status quo. This "cutting chives" mentality was most common among rich peasants and former rich peasants. For example, Zhao Senrong from Nancun, who owned more than 30 mu of land, dared not buy livestock, fearing that the masses would see him buying livestock and want to struggle against him. 3. The idea of it being late in spring and taking a rest. For example, Niu Yinhuo from Xiwu Village said: "This spring, I have my own land, houses, and farm tools. Besides, this year is a leap February, and it's not too late to repair the rake temporarily when it's time to plant." After discovering the above difficulties and hindering ideas, discussions were launched at the meeting. After debate, solutions were reached: First, the problem of lack of labor and lack of confidence. Through precise calculations, it was clarified that mutual aid teams should expand the number of households, generally to more than ten households, organizing semi-laborers to use livestock to transport fertilizer and harrow the land, and full laborers to carry and transport fertilizer, repair the land, and engage in transportation. Labor strength, technical skill, and amount of work were all unified, and work points were recorded and profits were distributed accordingly. Unified and large-scale labor exchange. For example, the group of Lao Ying and Sun Aisheng in Xiwu had 230 mu of autumn land and 13 and a half male full and semi-laborers. After precise calculations, it was found that in addition to participating in agricultural production, they could also extract labor for transportation. Second, the problem of combining production with support for the war. Production, support for the war, and support labor were unified and combined. For example, Ma Chonglai, the political director in the city, said: The size of the points is determined according to the distance, weight, and importance of the assignment. Work tickets are issued uniformly. The group has a leader and a deputy leader. The leader leads production, and the deputy leader manages labor and animal power and manages assignments. Agriculture, sideline occupations, war participation, and support labor are all recorded uniformly in the group, and labor is exchanged uniformly. In this way, both production and war participation are not delayed. Third, the main ideas of fear of getting rich, waste, and late spring were resolved. After discussing Shi Cunjin's path to prosperity, the above confused ideas were cleared, and the slogan of pulling out the roots of poverty and planting the roots of wealth, and learning from the new rich peasant Shi Cunjin, was proposed.

    参战生产统一变工
    农副结合按活分红
    【本报黎城讯】一区于四月十日召开全区村干部英雄积极分子及小学教员共六百五十七人的扩大会议，根据翻身后农民有什么思想要求与认识展开讨论。讨论中农民反映了当前迫切的要求是：（一）要求生产发家致富，特别是新翻身的赤贫农民要求更迫切，如南村一村经翻身后就增添了十二头骡。（二）妇女要求进一步开展纺织运动，提高技术，改造工具，做到穿衣自给，卖布不卖花，推行了小型纺织工厂，进一步推进纺织工作。（三）积极参战消灭蒋介石，彻底刨老根，这一要求是普遍的；如李庄赵庚儿三番五次要求参战等。（四）要求少开会，腾出时间生产。总之，大家总的要求是立即进行大生产和纺织副业生产。在这当中同时发现开展大生产运动的困难与思想障碍：（一）劳力缺乏，对春耕没信心。（二）参战支差与生产脱节问题。翻身后民兵积极要求参战，这是好的一面，但也产生了等待思想，不生产，借口准备参战，实际是专门等待代款。另一种是大量建设与支差结合不好，也影响了生产。如乔家庄建桥，没注意生产结合，统计一天内浪费民力十二个。（三）开展春耕运动的几个思想障碍：１、过一天吃一天的浪费享乐思想。如上桂花祝江义检讨，翻身后产生好吃懒做的想法，把分的两万多元果实钱也花光，自己还借口丰衣足食，忘记了生产。２、怕富思想，在生产中不积极发展，维持原状，这种割韭菜思想在富农与旧富农中最多。如南村赵森荣种有三十余亩地，该买牲口不敢买，恐怕买上牲口群众看见要斗他。３、春深与歇一歇思想。如西仵村牛银货说：“今春自己有了土地房屋农具，同时今年闰二月，天气还不迟，到种地时临时修耙不迟。发现以上困难和阻碍思想后，大会上展开讨论，经过争辩，得到解决：一、无劳力与无信心问题。经过精确计算，明确了互助组要扩大户数，一般在十户以上，组织半劳力使用牲口运肥耙地，全劳力担运肥料修地和搞运输，统一按劳力强弱技术高低做活多少按工记分红，统一大变工。如西仵劳英孙爱生组有秋地二百卅亩，男全半劳力十三个半，经过精确计算，除参加农业生产外，还能抽出劳力进行运输。二、生产与支差参战结合问题。生产与参战支差统一结合。如城内政治主任马崇来谈：根据差的远近轻重决定分数的大小，统一发工票，组里设正副组长，正组长领导生产，副组长掌握劳畜力，管理差务，在组里做农业与副业参战支差统一记分，统一变工，这样做到了生产参战两不耽误。三、解决怕富浪费春深等主要思想，经过讨论石寸金的发家致富方向后，才打通了以上糊涂思想，提出口号，拔了穷根栽富根，学习新富农石寸金。
