　　Strive for the Glorious Title of "Liu Bocheng Coal Mine"
    Qingbeishan Miners Compete to Increase Production
    [Our Newspaper] The production campaign of the Qingbeishan miners in Wuxiang entered a tense stage starting on March 1st. They first conducted a short period of study using the method of "think about the past, compare with the present, and look to the future" to overcome the miners' thoughts of changing professions, enhance their class consciousness, and consciously and automatically join the production competition. On March 6th, a meeting of all mine workers and staff was held. Du Jinliang, the chairman of the trade union, called on everyone to work hard to produce, dig out the old roots (defeat Chiang Kai-shek), and strive for the victory of a great turnaround. Manager Liu Weiwu called on everyone to do more good deeds for the people. Especially in today's tense situation, comrades who have made contributions should make even more, and those who have not made contributions should quickly make them, and work together to strive to become a glorious "Liu Bocheng Coal Mine." Under this slogan, all workers were determined to increase production and do their work well, and immediately set out a plan. Technical expert Liu Shirong said: "I am responsible for organizing technical research to ensure that this campaign will greatly improve the mine's technology, and to ensure the emergence of more experts and technicians." Yang Ma'er said: "I want to work harder and dig two more inches of coal every day to ensure sufficient raw materials." Gong Liucheng said: "I myself want to strive to be a labor model and ensure that my team saves one manpower every day, not only to avoid production losses, but also to ensure that production exceeds the quota." The plans of nine other comrades, including Liu Shao and Gong Laiyun, were equally energetic. Because of the backbone and leading role of these eleven people, it aroused the enthusiasm of everyone to launch a competition. The workers all said: "We guarantee to dare to challenge you and never fall behind you." This also prompted the factory to propose: "Guarantee to sell more coal to achieve wide sales; accumulate enough kerosene and tools for a year, and save materials and tools for each comrade. In addition to material rewards, half of the profits will also be distributed as bonuses, and the factory will be fully responsible for solving the workers' medical treatment and personal difficulties." This made the workers even more satisfied and happy to produce with all their strength. Finally, a unanimous resolution was made: to strive to achieve "sufficient raw materials, large quantity, low cost, and wide sales" before "August 1st" and create a glorious "Liu Bocheng Coal Mine." After this resolution, production increased day by day. According to preliminary estimates, the total monthly increase in March was 120,000 catties. (Zhao Bingying)

　　努力争取“刘伯承煤矿”光荣称号
    青背山矿工竞赛增产
    【本报讯】武乡青背山矿工生产运动从三月一日开始进入紧张阶段，他们首先以“想想过去，比比现在，看看将来”的方式，进行了一个短期的学习，克服矿工的转业思想，提高了阶级觉悟，自觉自动的卷入了生产竞赛。三月六日开了全矿工人职员会议，工会主任杜锦良号召大家努力生产刨老根（打败蒋介石），争取大翻身的胜利。经理刘维武号召大家给人民多立功，特别是时局紧张的今天，每个同志有功的更应加功，无功的应赶快立功，共同努力争取当一个光荣的“刘伯承煤矿”。在这一口号下，全体工友决心要提高生产，做好工作，当场订出计划。技术能手刘水荣说：“我负责组织技术研究，保证这次运动全矿技术大改进，并要保证出现更多的能手、技师。”杨马儿说：“我要加工，每天多刨二寸煤，保证原料足。”巩留成说：“我自己要争取当一个劳动模范，保证在我领导的小组内每天节省人力一个，不但不让生产受损失，而且还要保证超过产量”。其它还有刘绍、巩来云等九个同志的计划也同样有劲。由于他十一人的骨干与带头作用，引起了全体展开竞赛，工人们都说：“俺们保证敢和你们挑战，决不落你们的后。”这样引起厂方也提出：“保证更多的出售煤炭，达到销路广；在灯油工具上要积蓄一年够用，每个同志节省物资工具等，除以物资奖励外，还要各半分红，工友们的疾病治疗与其个人困难厂方完全负责解决。”这样使工人更加满意，高兴愉快的全力生产。最后一致决议：决心要在“八一”前做到“原料足、数量多、成本低、销路广”，创造光荣的“刘伯承煤矿”。这样决议以后，产量一天天上升，据初步估计，三月份全月即增产十二万斤。（赵秉英）
