[Report from our newspaper in Zuoquan] Elderly People in Yangjiao Village Overcome Ideological Obstacles and Report Landlord's Hidden Silver Ingots; Three Re-examinations Carried Out in Songshuping
    [Report from our newspaper in Zuoquan] Yangjiao Village deeply mobilized to "eliminate backwardness" and squeeze out feudalism. At the mobilization meeting of all village cadres, Li Zhonghua, chairman of the farmers' association, said: "Now the tenacity of feudalism does not lie in the landlords, but in the 'backward' people who have not awakened. If we want to completely eliminate feudalism, we must mobilize the 'backward' farmers." After everyone calculated, there were still 52 "backward" farmers in the village who had not been mobilized. Village chief Wu Baojin also said: "We not only did not unite with them, but also excluded them, saying, 'The 'backward' are the landlords' running dogs.'" The cadres first made self-criticisms and then went to the people's school to reflect to the masses, which moved the "backward" farmers. Yao San said: "I wanted to marry a landlord's woman, so I carried water and chopped firewood for her." Li Quan said: "I still have a quilt and a mattress from the landlord." At this meeting, six farmers reported that they had kept 32 pieces of clothing and bedding from the landlord, as well as many other things, worth over 200,000 yuan. Then, Guo Zhongtang, an old man of sixty-five, said: "The landlord still has nine silver ingots that have not been taken out, and I know where they are hidden." After these people's thoughts were cleared, they used the method of mobilizing "backward" people by those who had overcome their "backwardness". Now, more than 50 "backward" people are actively participating in the farmers' association and have launched an in-depth struggle against the landlords, continuing to overthrow five households, including landlord Wang En, and recovering fruits worth more than 2 million yuan. The things that have come out of this struggle are no less than last winter. Now the "backward" masses are liquidating the bad ideas given by the landlords. (Zemin, Hangquan)
    [Report from our newspaper in Zuoquan] After adjusting the relationship between cadres and the masses in Songshuping, they turned to the "backward" and used activists and "backward" farmers to confide in each other, and after mobilization, they understood that the "backward" farmers had several ideological obstacles: (1) "After overthrowing the tiger, eat the meat alone," thinking that they were poor peasants and could be divided even without fighting. (2) Having been criticized by cadres, they were pessimistic and disappointed, and dared not express their opinions for fear of retaliation. (3) Poverty is fate, afraid of offending people and things changing, there is no way out. (4) "Backward" farmers in the mountains belittled themselves, thinking that no one would care about their opinions.
    After discovering these thoughts, they convened a meeting of "backward" farmers and activists to start a discussion. The idea of fate being poor was overcome by thinking about the past and comparing it with the present. Li Yuxi, who never spoke in the past, said: "In the past, I thought I was farming the rich man's land and should be grateful to him. Now I think the landlord does not move, and the poor suffer for a year. Today, I think I should settle accounts with those dogs for our blood and sweat." Secondly, from the analogy that "the landlord is like a big tiger, and if you don't work together to fight the tiger, you will definitely get hurt," they realized that it was wrong to eat the meat alone after overthrowing the tiger. "Backward" farmer Li Zhongqiu said: "Everyone discussed giving me some of the fruits, but I still have two urns of grain and two packages stored for the landlord Zhai Gui. I feel that if I get some fruits and then become the landlord's 'air raid shelter,' I feel guilty. I want to take out all the landlord's things so that everyone can share more."
    On the basis of the masses' ideological awakening, they carried out a re-examination. This is the third time, and they have found another 38 mu of land, more than 30 packages, 250,000 yuan in Hebei currency, and many other things. (Xiuzeng)

　　羊角老年人思想打通
    报出地主暗埋元宝
    松树坪开展三次复查
    【本报左权讯】羊角村深入发动“落后”挤封建。在全村干部动员会上，农会主席李忠华说：“现在封建不在地主顽强，而在“落后”人未觉悟起来。如要想彻底消灭封建，必须发动‘落后’农民。经大家一计算，全村还有五十二个‘落后’农民未有发动起来，村长武保金又说：“咱不但没团结人家，而且排斥人家说：‘落后’是地主的走狗。”干部首先作了检讨，又到民校向群众作了反省，感动了“落后”农民。姚三的说：“我想和地主妇女结婚，所以给人家担水、打柴。”李全说：“我还保存地主的被子褥子各一条。”在这个会上有六个农民自报出保存地主衣被等三十二件及其他东西很多，值洋二十余万。接着有六十五岁老汉郭忠唐说：“地主还有九个元宝未拿出，我知道在什么地方放着。”这些人的思想打通后，用经过“落后”人去动员“落后”的方法，现在五十余落后人都积极参加农会。向地主开展了深入斗争。继续斗倒地主王恩的等五户，收回果实共值洋二百余万元。这段斗出来的东西比去冬也不少。现“落后”群众正在清算地主给予的坏思想。（泽民、杭全）
    【本报左权讯】松树坪干部群众关系调整后，便面向“落后”，运用积极分子和“落后”农民对心事人，进行个别串通，经过发动了解了“落后”农民有几种思想障碍：（一）“打倒老虎清吃肉”，认为自己是贫农，不斗也能分。（二）被干部碰过，悲观失望，有意见不敢提，怕报复。（三）穷是命穷，怕惹了人变天，没办法。（四）山上“落后”农民轻看自己，认为提意见也没人理。
    发现这些思想后，便召集“落后”农民与积极分子会议，展开讨论。从想想过去，比比现在中打通了命穷思想，过去永不说话的李玉喜说：“过去认为是种财主地，应该领人家情。现在想地主不动弹，穷人受一年，今天想应该和狗日算咱血汗腿。”其次从“地主好比大老虎，打虎不齐心，必定会伤人”的比喻中认识打倒老虎清吃肉不对。落后农民李忠秋说：大家讨论给我分果实，可是我还给地主翟贵存放的二瓮谷、两个包袱，觉着分上果实再当上地主“防空洞”心上觉得亏，要把地主的东西一齐拿出来咱大家多分些。”
    在群众思想觉悟的基础上开展复查，这是第三次了，又查出土地三十八亩、包袱三十余个，冀钞二十五万元及其它东西甚多。（秀曾）
