The People's Liberation Army in Xinjiang

　　Xinjiang is a famous industrial and commercial city in southern Shanxi. Under the deception of Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan, the citizens imagined the People's Army to be very frightening. However, within minutes of the liberation of Xinjiang, they merged with this army. Many shops opened immediately, and residents stood in groups on the streets to welcome the army. Praise was everywhere: truly "heavenly soldiers," truly an army of benevolence and righteousness!

　　This unit, called "heavenly soldiers" and an army of benevolence and righteousness, is a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army in southern Shanxi. They not only fought beautifully in Xinjiang, but also truly achieved complete adherence to city discipline and complete selflessness regarding public property.

　　Before entering the city, they conducted thorough and repeated mobilization, deliberation, and discussion. Cadres expressed their determination to uphold mass discipline and battlefield discipline. Squadrons held soldiers' meetings, and party branches held party members' meetings. Party members and soldiers all made guarantees at the meetings, and cadres and soldiers, Communist Party members and non-party members, each platoon, and each company had the right to supervise each other. Party member Zhou Xinmin of the Seventh Company said at the meeting: "Since we can sacrifice our lives for the Party and the people, can't we even refrain from taking things from the masses?" Thus, doing a good job in mass discipline and battlefield discipline became a mass movement in many companies. They universally proposed "one no entry, three no taking." They discussed during rest, during marches, and even in the short intervals before battle. When the assault on the city began, the assault team of the Seventh Company had already climbed halfway up the scaling ladder, and Company Commander Zhang Mingquan and the Party Branch Secretary were still shouting below: "Comrades, remember 'one no entry, three no taking'!" The soldiers, while braving enemy fire to climb upwards, shouted: "We remember!"

　　After entering the city, whether in battle or after battle, the soldiers thoroughly acted according to the slogan. When the Fourth Company was marching on the street, enemy planes came, and they took cover under the eaves of houses. The people said: "Your troops have been in for a long time, and we didn't even know! Truly, they don't disturb chickens or dogs!"

　　The enemy's warehouses and cooperatives were sealed up by the soldiers as soon as the troops entered the city, and they guarded them, waiting for the superiors to inspect them. No one went in for several days. Outside the west gate, there was a car full of cigarettes, and someone asked to take one or two boxes to smoke, but the guarding soldiers refused. The warehouse guarded by the Third Squad of the Ninth Company was full of wheat and salt, but no one touched it. Battlefield discipline was also well maintained. There was this incident: in the confusion of battle, a person in plain clothes was mistakenly captured, and 32 million yuan in Chiang currency was found on him. After it was clarified that he was a merchant, the money was returned to him in full. After the battle, the merchant searched the streets for the troops who had returned his money. After finding them, he insisted on inviting the battalion commander to dinner. The battalion commander firmly refused. The merchant said: "I've been doing business all over Beijing, Shanghai, and Hankou, and I've never seen troops with such good discipline like yours!" After that, this merchant came to see them almost every day. (Feng Mu)

### 人民解放军在新绛

　　人民解放军在新绛
    新绛是晋南著名的工商业城市。在蒋阎欺骗下，市民想像中的人民军队是很可怕的。但是，新绛解放后几分钟，他们就和这个军队融成了一片。许多商店立刻开门了，居民们成群停立在街头欢迎军队。到处在赞扬着：真是“天兵”真是仁义之师呀！
    这被称为“天兵”和仁义之师的队伍是晋南人民解放军某部。他们不只在新绛打仗漂亮，并且在城市纪律上真正作到了秋毫无犯，在公共资财上作到了大公无私。
    他们入城之前，即进行了深入反复的动员，酝酿和讨论。干部们纷纷表示作好群众纪律和战场纪律的决心。中队召开军人大会，支部召开党员大会，党员和战士们都在会上提出保证，干部和战士、共产党员和非党员、各排、各连，都有互相监督的权力。七连党员周新民在会上说：“我们既然能为党为人民牺牲性命，难道连不拿群众东西都做不到么”？于是做好群众纪律和战场纪律在许多连队中成为群众性的运动。他们普遍提出“一不进三不拿”。他们在休息时讨论，行军时讨论，甚至在战斗前的短短间隙中还在讨论。登城战开始时，七连的突击队已经爬上了云梯的一半，连长张明泉和支书还在下面喊着：“同志们，好好记住一不进、三不拿呀！”战士们一面冒着敌人的火力向上爬，一面喊着：“记住了！”
    进城以后，不论在战斗中和战斗后，战士们都彻底照口号作了。四连在街上行军时，敌机来了，他们就在屋檐下隐蔽。老百姓都说：“你们队伍进来很久了，我们还不知道！真是鸡狗不惊！”
    敌人的仓库、合作社在队伍刚一进城后就被战士们密封起来，自己看守着等上级来查验。好几天都没一个人进去。西门外有一辆满载纸烟的汽车，有人要求取一两盒出来吸，但都被守卫的战士拒绝了。九连三班看守的仓库，满装了麦和盐，但没有一个人动，战场纪律也同样作得好。有这么件事：在战斗混乱中，误俘虏了一个穿便衣的，从他身上搜出三千二百万元蒋币。后来查清是商人，便把钱如数还了他。战斗结束后，这个商人在各街找寻还他钱的这支队伍。找到之后，一定要请营长去吃饭。营长坚辞不去，这商人说：“我作生意，跑遍了北平、上海、汉口，还没有见过像你们有这样好纪律的队伍！”以后这个商人几乎每天都要来看他们一次。（冯牧）
