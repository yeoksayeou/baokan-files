　　[Reported by this newspaper's PingShun Dispatch] When Wangzhuang Village began to launch its spring textile campaign, some cadres believed that Wangzhuang Village already had a foundation in textile work, so they didn't think it necessary to teach those women who didn't know how to spin. The masses felt that spring was well underway, and it wouldn't be too late to spin slowly. Some mothers with young children felt that they couldn't spin at all because they had to hold the children and cook. Some new learners spun only one or two liang (50-100 grams) a day and felt that spinning wasn't worthwhile, and it would be better to do other things to make a living. Therefore, the textile movement in the whole village did not reach a climax in the first month of the lunar year. Since the village cadres returned from a meeting in the district and convened an expanded cadre meeting and the masses used the civil school to calculate accounts and make plans, once the thinking of cadres and the masses was aligned, everyone recognized the importance of textile work for becoming prosperous. The masses immediately discussed, "To become prosperous, one must spin cotton." All 135 spinning women and 36 weaving women in the village actively poured into this large-scale textile movement, and they made textile plans, and formulated methods such as household dividend distribution and unified labor exchange between men and women. For example, Wang Shuanhao's family has two spinning women who spin their own cotton. After weaving it into cloth, it is converted into money at the market price. After deducting the cost of the cotton, the earned money is divided between the family and the spinners at a ratio of 80/20. Wang Kecheng's textile small-scale cooperative uses unified labor exchange between men and women, using work points. Men doing a day's work receive five work points, women spinning one jin (500 grams) of cotton receive ten work points, weaving one jin of cloth receives six work points, and winding one jin of thread receives two work points. In this way, neither men nor women suffer losses, and both public and private interests are taken into account. The enthusiasm of the textile women is even higher. In order to study and improve weaving technology, the large cooperative's textile factory specially invited a 64-year-old weaving teacher to study the problems with the thread and the loom, and found that the main reason for the low weaving output was the poor quality of the thread paste and insufficient twisting. The thread broke easily on the loom, and the workers only cared about tying the broken ends without paying attention to weaving. After the teacher and apprentices studied and found the reason, a technology research committee was established, composed of eleven textile experts and teachers from various small-scale textile cooperatives in the village. Only then was the weaving technology greatly improved. (Ben Zhong, Qun You)

　　聘请能手互相学习王庄纺织技术提高
    【本报平顺讯】王庄村开始发动春季纺织时，有的干部认为王庄村的纺织工作已有基础，就不说吧那个妇女还不知道纺花。群众则感到今年春深，慢慢纺不迟，还有一部分奶孩子的妇女觉的抱孩子又要做饭，根本纺不了花；还有些新学的，一天纺一、二两感到纺花不顶事，不如做其他生活发财，因此正月间全村纺织运动没有走上高潮。自从村干部在区开会回来，召开全村扩干会议及群众在民校从算账订计划，打通了干群思想后才一致认识了纺织发家的重要。群众即纷纷议论着“要想发家必须纺花”，全村一百三十五个纺妇三十六个织妇都积极涌入这一纺织大运动，纷纷订出了纺织计划，并订出家庭分红及男女统一变工等办法。如王拴好家两个纺妇，纺自己家棉花，织成布后，按市价折成钱，除去花本洋外，赚的钱，和家里按二八分红。如王科成纺织小型合作，是男女统一变工，使用工票，男人做一天生活须五分工，妇女纺一斤花顶十分，织一斤布顶六分，络一斤线顶二分，这样男女双方均不吃亏，公私兼顾，纺织妇情绪更加高涨。大合作社纺织厂为了研究提高织布技术，特又请来六十四岁的织布老师研究线和机上的毛病，找出织布少的原因主要是线浆的不好，拧的少，到机上光断，只顾接线头不顾织。经老师和徒弟研究找出原因后，全村各纺织小型合作社的纺织能手和老师共十一人成立了技术研究委员会，织布技术才大大提高。（本中、群有）
