Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, April 24th. Comprehensive reports from various sources: The Foreign Ministers Conference and the Foreign Ministers' Assistants Conference on Germany held meetings on the 23rd. The Foreign Ministers Conference discussed the report of the Foreign Ministers' Assistants Conference on Germany. Part One of the report, concerning suggestions for eliminating German militarism and remnants of Nazism, democratization, population transfers, and territorial readjustments, was agreed upon by the four foreign ministers to be submitted to the Allied Control Council as a guide for action. Part Two of the report details German economic principles, post-war economic levels, and reparations plans; Part Three details the issue of Germany's temporary political institutions. The four foreign ministers also agreed to refer the issues of reparations and temporary political institutions to the Foreign Ministers' Assistants Conference on Germany for further study.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, April 22nd. TASS reports: During the Foreign Ministers Conference on the 20th, discussions continued on the draft of the Austrian State Treaty. The four foreign ministers have approved several already decided clauses of the draft Austrian State Treaty and agreed to add several supplements to the treaty. Supplements on which no agreement was reached were submitted to the Foreign Ministers' Assistants for further study. After the Soviet representative withdrew opposition to Article 52 proposed by the American representative—namely, that freight and traffic from Salzburg Province through Leogang and Stein Pass (note: both located where Baden Province borders Switzerland) to Lofer Province be exempt from tariffs—the foreign ministers proceeded to a second reading of the draft treaty to review clauses on which agreement had not been reached during the first reading. The representatives of the United States, Britain, and France agreed to withdraw their original objections—namely, the Soviet representative's proposal in the third paragraph of the preamble: "In this annex, Austria is regarded as a participant in the war waged by Hitler's Germany against the Allied and Associated Powers and other United Nations. Since Germany used Austrian troops and national resources for this purpose, Austria cannot escape certain responsibilities arising from participation in the war." Thus, the entire preamble was passed. According to the proposals completed by the Foreign Ministers' Assistants, Article 6 on the naturalization and residence of Germans in Austria, and Article 18 on prohibiting former Nazi organizations from serving in the Austrian army, have both been agreed upon. Article 24 on restricting the construction of fortresses within Austria was decided to be changed in form and included in another article as a separate paragraph. The Foreign Ministers' Assistants on Austria also met at 4:30 p.m. to consider the clauses of the draft Austrian State Treaty submitted by the Foreign Ministers Conference on which no agreement had been reached.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, April 23rd. TASS reports: On the 21st and 22nd, the Foreign Ministers Conference and the Foreign Ministers' Assistants Conference intensified their work and continued to discuss the clauses of the draft Austrian State Treaty on which no agreement had been reached, and the financial status of Trieste. On the 22nd, the four foreign ministers also held an informal meeting, and an agreement was reached on the financial status of Trieste. Regarding several unresolved issues in the draft Austrian State Treaty, some agreements were reached at the Foreign Ministers' Assistants Conference on the 21st, such as: Article 11 on war criminals and Article 33 on the withdrawal of Allied forces from Austria. Regarding Article 36 on Austria's reconstruction work, only one point regarding the procedure for restoring railway transportation was retained, with the Soviet delegation insisting on its opinion on this point. Agreement was also reached on the first paragraph of Article 45 concerning Austria's property in the territories of the United Nations. This clause states: The Allied and Associated Powers declare their willingness to return to Austria in their respective territories Austrian property and legal rights existing therein in their original state. In cases where the property or rights have been liquidated, processed, or sold in other ways, the cash obtained from the liquidation, processing, or sale shall be returned to Austria (but prior payment and repayment of accumulated taxes, management fees, creditors' demands, and other similar expenses are required). For this purpose, the Allied and Associated Powers are prepared to conclude agreements with the Austrian government; the Foreign Ministers' Assistants have agreed; this clause shall not have any legal effect on Yugoslavs previously participating in the occupation of Austria.
