　　Military Region Political Department
    Conducts Propaganda During Agricultural Assistance
    [Our Newspaper] After receiving the notice regarding assisting the masses with spring plowing, the Military Region Political Department immediately conducted discussions and research on the 16th, organizing a total of forty-four people into nine groups to help the masses with spring plowing. After discussions involving administrative, mass mobilization groups, and village cadre joint meetings, specific assistance measures were determined: (1) Cadres will form groups based on Party cells, and soldiers will form groups based on administrative organization, with a designated group leader. (2) The group list will be given to the village cadres, who will reasonably allocate assistance based on the needs of military families and families of those participating in the war who lack labor (a total of more than sixty households). (3) Allocation will be done through a group contracting system, such as the Organization Department group helping certain households; the group leader will first study with the mutual aid team leader to specifically determine which family to help first and how to help. (4) The time is set from after dinner until dark. Each group can adjust the time as needed, ensuring that the assisted masses do not miss the spring plowing season, especially after rain, when efforts should be intensified. The assistance time is generally set for seven to ten days. (5) Do not eat the masses' food, do not smoke the masses' cigarettes, and do not accept any compensation from the masses. (6) Absolutely listen to the masses' commands; do whatever the masses ask and do it in the way they ask. (7) Propaganda work should be carried out during assistance, with the central message being to recognize the inevitable defeat of the Chiang army, actively support the front lines, and accelerate the victory of the self-defense war. (8) Registration and commendation will be conducted during the assistance, and a summary will be conducted after the assistance is completed. Assistance has now begun. (Meiling)
    [Another Report] A certain unit of the Democratic Nation-Building Army, responding to the Border Region Government's call, has begun assisting the masses with spring plowing in its stationed area. (Wang Junyuan)

　　军区政治部
    助耕中进行宣传
    【本报讯】军区政治部接到关于帮助群众春耕通知后，十六日即进行讨论研究，共组织了四十四人，分九个组，帮助群众春耕。并经过行政、民运小组和村干部联席会讨论，定出具体帮助办法：（１）干部以党的小组为基础，战士以行政组织为基础，组成小组，指定小组长。（２）将小组名单交给村干，由村干部根据全村缺乏劳力的军属，参战家属等需要情形（共六十余家），合理分配。（３）分配时采取各组包工办法，如组织部小组帮助那几家，小组长先与互助组长研究，具体规定先帮那家，如何帮助。（４）时间确定晚饭后到天黑。各组可以伸缩，保证被帮助群众不误春耕，特别是雨后，更要加紧帮助。帮助时间大体上规定七天到十天。（５）不吃群众的饭，不抽群众的烟，不要群众任何报酬。（６）要绝对听群众指挥，群众叫干啥就干啥，叫怎样干就怎样干。（７）在帮助中要进行宣传工作，中心是认清蒋军必败，积极支援前线，加速自卫战争胜利。（８）帮助中进行登记、表扬，帮助完毕，进行总结。现已开始进行助耕。（梅岭）
