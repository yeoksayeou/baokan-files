    Yuanqu Land Reform in Border Areas
    Advancing towards Enemy-Occupied Points and Lines
    Counter-Settlement Elements in Pingyao Repent and Turn Back
    [Report from our Taiyue office on the 18th] The Yuanqu Land Reform Committee reported on the 26-day struggle for emancipation of farmers throughout the county, stating that the movement in the hinterland is nearing its end and that it will be able to fully shift its focus to the border areas by the middle of the month. Excluding the enemy-occupied areas, the county has a total of 41 villages. From the high tide of the struggle on March 4th to the end of March, farmers in 33 villages have obtained land and houses. According to statistics from 29 villages, more than 10,000 men and women were involved in the movement, recovering 16,670 mu of land, 1,387 houses, 491 cave dwellings, 74 head of livestock, 6.26 million in local currency, and 261 shi of grain. Households that received gains accounted for 93%. The 325 extremely poor households have been eliminated, 758 poor peasant households have been elevated, and more than 370 militiamen have been developed. The villages in the border areas were conducted amidst sharp armed struggles between the enemy and us. On the Jiang (County)-Yuan (Qu) highway, with ×× village as the general defense line of the joint defense villages, the militia and armed turn-over teams of various villages in the ×× area bravely fought, engaging in 64 battles with the enemy in 26 days, killing or wounding 68 enemies, and injuring 9 enemies with landmines, covering the distribution of land in Baishui, Shangdu, Xiadu and other villages in the battle. Especially Shangdu and Xiadu, which are located under the enemy's碉堡, the armed turn-over team combined with the militia to monitor the enemy day and night, covering the masses, and distributed land in two days and two nights. In the enemy-intertwined area of ​​Zhu Village, the masses were often evacuated and moved around, and the land was distributed within ten days. At present, the whole county is concentrating its efforts on turning to the border areas and advancing towards the enemy-occupied points and lines to carry out armed land distribution.
    [Report from our Taiyue office on the 18th] The guerrilla warfare and land reform movement in the fifth district of Pingyao are progressing rapidly. When the enemy attacked the district, it fell behind enemy lines. Yan Xishan's "Struggle Corps" was extremely rampant, and reactionary landlords took the opportunity to "counter-settle". The landlord Ji Mintai of Liang Village threatened the masses, saying: "Return all my land, and give you a '25%' rent reduction. Otherwise, be careful!" At the same time, he threatened the farmers in the name of purchasing materials, and sent all the fruits of the struggle into the city. There were also many reactionary landlords who stole the fruits of the farmers by using the despicable means of crying poverty, and the farmers at the bottom of Liangpo returned all the fruits as a result. Recently, the armed work team and the peasant association cadres in the district have been advancing together, and villages such as Dongquan, Liangpodi, Zhaobi, and Yuanci have become bases for resisting "counter-settlement" and are extending outwards, liquidating all "counter-settlement" elements. Whenever they arrive at a village, they first conduct an investigation and display the "merit and demerit book", recording merits for those who have merits, and recording crimes for those who have committed crimes, and then hand them over to the masses for disposal according to the size of the crimes. They suppressed the reactionary arrogance and won over the coerced elements. On the "merit and demerit book" of Liangpodi Village, one demerit was recorded for the "counter-settlement" landlord Ba'er, and he secretly sought relationships with the peasant association, saying: "It was ×× who forced me to 'counter-settle'." He personally led the militia to capture the "counter-settlement" elements, and the farmers in the village recovered all the fruits they deserved from the reactionary landlords. The armed work team in the district created the "drawing firewood from under the cauldron" tactic, attacking small groups of enemies, capturing special agents, and destroying maintenance forces day and night in the rear of the enemy. On the 19th and 20th of last month, more than 200 enemies cooperated with more than 30 Japanese troops to jointly attack the Dongquan Town and Shuimo area of ​​our district. The armed work team detoured to the Chang Village and Zhao Village area on the enemy's flanks, and defeated the enemy's "Struggle Corps", forcing the enemy to flee back in a hurry.

　　垣曲边地分田
    向敌占点线推进
    平遥倒算分子纷纷悔过回头
    【本报太岳十八日电】垣曲土地改革委员会报导全境二十六天农民翻身斗争情况称：腹地运动已到末期，月中即可全力转入边沿区。全县除敌占区外，共四十一村。从三月四日进入斗争高潮至三月底，已有三十三村农民获得土地、房屋。据二十九村统计，卷入运动的男女达一万多人，收回土地一万六千六百七十亩，房屋一千三百八十七间，窑洞四百九十一孔，耕畜七十四头，本币六百二十六万元，粮食二百六十一石。分得果实户占百分之九十三。赤贫三百二十五户已消灭，贫农七百五十八户上升，并发展民兵三百七十余人。边沿区村庄是在敌我尖锐的武装斗争中进行的。绛（县）垣（曲）公路上以××村为联防村的总防线，××一带各村民兵与武装翻身队，皆奋勇作战，在二十六天中与敌作战六十四次，杀伤敌人六十八名，埋雷炸伤敌人九名，掩护白水、上杜、下杜等村在战斗中分配了土地。尤其是上杜、下杜，皆在敌人碉堡之下，武装翻身队结合民兵日夜监视敌人，掩护群众，两天两夜分配了土地。朱家庄敌我交错区，群众时常疏散游动，亦在十日内分配了土地。现全县，正集中力量转入边沿区，向敌占点线推进武装分田。
    【本报太岳十八日电】平遥五区游击战争与土地改革运动正突飞猛进中。该区在敌进攻时，曾陷于敌后。阎锡山的“奋斗团”异常猖獗，反动地主趁机“倒算”。梁村地主冀敏泰恐吓群众说：“将我的土地全部退还，再给你们‘二五’减租。不然，你可小心点！”同时以收买物资为名，威胁农民，将斗争果实全部送进城内。反动地主以哭穷的卑鄙手段向农民盗取果实者亦甚多，梁坡底农民即因此将全部果实退回。最近该区武工队与农会干部一齐向前推进，东泉、梁坡底、赵壁、沅祠等村已成为反“倒算”的基地，并向外伸展，清算一切“倒算”分子。每至一村，首先进行调查，摆出“功过簿”，有功者记功，有罪者记罪，然后分别罪恶大小交给群众处理。镇压了反动气焰，争取了胁从分子。梁坡底村“功过簿”上给“倒算”地主八儿记了一过，他便暗地里找关系向农会说：“是××强迫我去‘倒算’的。”他并亲自带领民兵捕捉了“倒算”分子，该村农民又从反动地主手中全部收回应得果实。该区武工队创造“釜底抽薪”战术，日夜在敌人的后方袭击小股敌人，捕捉特务，摧毁维持。上月十九、二十两日，敌二百余人配合日军三十余人，合击我东泉镇、水磨头一带。武工队绕往敌人的侧面常村、赵村一带，击溃了敌人的“奋斗团”，敌不得不仓惶窜回。
