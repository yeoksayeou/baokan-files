Xinhua News Agency, Tongpu Front, urgent telegram on the 15th: The Taiyue People's Liberation Army captured Quwo City, one of the three major military bases in southern Shanxi, at 5:00 AM this morning. Quwo City, along with Linfen and Yuncheng, are important military bases and reactionary political strongholds in southern Shanxi. Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan stationed heavy troops there to control southern Shanxi and use it as a base to advance into Shangdang. In the past, the Japanese invaders constructed fortifications with massive engineering projects. After Yan Xishan occupied it, he spent even more effort and forcibly seized civilians to process and repair them. There were two outer moats outside the pass, about two to three zhang deep and wide. Along the city, there were three layers of firepower equipment, with towering bunkers above, gun holes on the city walls in the middle, and hidden bunkers on the ground below. Various bunkers were also built on the streets inside the city, with more than 500 bunkers of various sizes throughout the city. On January 13th last year, the People's Liberation Army once entered the city, but later withdrew automatically in compliance with the ceasefire order. Yan Xishan therefore called it an impregnable "copper wall and iron bastion." Yesterday afternoon at 6:00 PM, the People's Liberation Army attacked the city again, ending the battle at 5:00 AM this morning. The two enemy regiments stationed there, as well as special agents, landlords, and local bullies, were all annihilated, and Quwo City was liberated. Another main force of our army has also made rapid progress in southern Fen River, capturing Yishi County in one fell swoop. All the defending enemies were annihilated, and the results of the two battles are currently being verified. The situation in southern Shanxi has undergone a major change. Except for the isolated stronghold of Wenxi City, the vast areas are all controlled by the People's Liberation Army, with unobstructed passage in all directions. Quwo and Yishi are the ninth and tenth county seats liberated by the People's Liberation Army in the ten-day offensive in southern Shanxi.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Henan Front, 17th: The People's Liberation Army of Northern Henan repelled the desperate counterattack of six brigades of Chiang's army, annihilating more than 600 enemies and destroying three enemy tanks. Chiang Kai-shek's defeated general, Wang Zhonglian, gathered a crowd of six brigades, with the Rapid Column 49th Brigade as the vanguard, and invaded Qi County on the 7th; on the 8th, 9th, and 13th, under the cover of tanks, they desperately attacked northward, attempting to relieve the siege of Tangyin. The People's Liberation Army resolutely resisted. As of the afternoon of the 10th, Chiang's army was unable to sustain the attack and fled south of the Zhan River in succession. In this battle, more than 600 enemies were killed and three tanks were destroyed.

　　晋南我军猛烈展开攻势
    解放曲沃歼敌两团
    猗氏城亦解放闻喜已陷孤立
    豫北敌六个旅北犯负创南溃
    【新华社同蒲前线十五日急电】太岳人民解放军于今晨五时，攻占晋南三大军事基地之一的曲沃城。按曲沃城与临汾、运城同为晋南重要军事基地与反动政治堡垒，蒋阎驻重兵以控制晋南，并依此进取上党。过去日寇曾以浩大工程构筑工事，阎锡山占据后，更费尽心血，强抓民夫加工修筑，关外有两道外壕，深宽约两丈至三丈。沿城有三层火力设备，上为林立之碉堡，中为城墙上之枪眼，下为地面之暗碉堡。城内街道亦筑有各种碉堡，全城大小碉堡五百余个。去年一月十三日，人民解放军曾一度攻入城内，后因遵守停战命令自动撤出，阎锡山因此自称为铜墙铁壁。昨日下午六时，人民解放军再进击该城，至今晨五时结束战斗。守敌两个团及特务地主恶霸等全部被歼灭，曲沃城遂获解放。我另一部主力，在汾南亦有神速进展，一举攻克猗氏县城，守敌全部被歼，两处战果正清查中。现晋南形势已大起变化，除闻喜城孤立据点外，广大地区全为人民解放军所控制，东西南北通行无阻。按曲沃、猗氏为晋南人民解放军十天攻势以来解放之第九、第十座县城。
    【新华社豫北前线十七日电】豫北人民解放军击退蒋军六个旅的绝望反扑，歼敌六百余人，毁敌坦克三辆，蒋家败将王仲廉纠集六旅之众，以快速纵队四十九旅为先导，七日侵入淇县城；八、九、十三日在坦克掩护下绝望北犯，图解汤阴之围。人民解放军坚强阻击，截至十日下午，蒋军不支，陆续溃窜湛河以南。是役共毙敌六百余人，击毁坦克三辆。
