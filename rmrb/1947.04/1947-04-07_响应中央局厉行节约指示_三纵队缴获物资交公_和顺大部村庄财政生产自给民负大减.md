　　In active response to the Central Bureau's March 15th directive on practicing economy, overcoming difficulties, and welcoming a bright future, the Third Column has turned over war-captured materials to the public. Since the Self-Defense War, the Third Column has captured 10.07 million 法币 (Nationalist currency), 110 silver dollars, 50 taels of silver fragments, eight gold rings, twenty pieces of jewelry, 65,000 catties of millet, 11,000 catties of wheat, and 200 bolts of cloth, all of which have been turned over to the public. The Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Military Region has issued a special commendation.

　　[本报讯] In Heshun, during the reorganization of local finances last year, the people's burden of grain and money was reduced by 28.9%. The achievement was mainly due to production profits, rectification of public property, and strengthening local income. However, the burden of village finances has not been completely alleviated, and it once formed chaos. For example, last year's village financial burden accounted for about 99% of the autumn public grain task. In order to ensure the victory of the Self-Defense War and overcome this abnormal phenomenon, the government made accurate calculations and thorough reorganization of this year's village financial burden, aiming to achieve production self-sufficiency on the one hand and reduce expenditures on the other. For example, the regulations for village offices are based on the size of the village and the complexity of the work, dividing all administrative villages in the county into three levels: A, B, and C, which are determined by the county government. The annual expenditure of the village office is controlled according to the prescribed level. In order to take care of the actual situation and overcome the previous unrealistic restriction of expenditures, which formed the phenomenon of covert levies in addition to overt ones, after this re-study, no village can exceed the limited amount. It is also determined that the expenditure of the county and village levels cannot exceed 15% of the border region's grain and money as the standard, and each village cannot arbitrarily create items for various expenditures. All expenditures outside the system are strictly prohibited. The grades of primary school and civil school teachers should be re-studied appropriately by the education department, and those whose grades do not meet the requirements can be re-determined. The amount of expenditure is supplied according to the grade, and the previous free-flowing state is abolished. Soliciting donations should be strictly abolished from now on. No village or cadre is allowed to mobilize the masses for any reason, and the district and village governments have no decision-making power. In the collection system, all legitimate grain and money expenditures are to be drafted by the district office into an annual expenditure budget, which must be approved by the county government before it can be levied from the masses. In the daily system, a village financial management committee is established, consisting of the village head, political director, and financial committee member, to achieve approval from top to bottom and supervision from bottom to top, and to be announced to the masses at the end of each month and filed once every three months. If the announcement and filing procedures are not followed, the leadership and the masses can deny all expenditures, and a final settlement is carried out at the end of the year. After the revenue and expenditure system was determined, accurate calculations were made. It is now stipulated that the county's village financial expenditure is 5,800,011,100 yuan; and the expenditure is 2,407 shi, 8 dou, 6 sheng, and 3 he of rice.
　　After this plan was drafted, County Magistrate Wang and Political Commissar Li made a detailed explanation at the production mobilization meeting, so that all party, government, military, and civilian cadres unanimously understood the importance of village finance ideologically. It was also pointed out that the size of the achievement would be used as one of the criteria for evaluating merit and establishing merit. At the scene, nineteen villages, including Songyan, Nuanyao, Longwang, Pingdichuan, Songgou, Jingshang, Beilingtou, Guanjia Yu, Brick Kiln, Beiguan, Hebei, Shuangyugou, Qingcheng, Fengtai, Wenyuan, Gaocun, Baibei, Heshan, and Tuling, took the lead in guaranteeing. Not only can they achieve expenditure thrift, but they also guarantee production self-sufficiency and not levy a single cent from the masses. After the production mobilization meeting, each village discussed and studied, and formulated its own plan. Now two-thirds of the villages in the county have achieved production self-sufficiency, and the village funds are not directly taken from the people. Moreover, they can follow the government's system and not overspend a single cent. The remaining one-third of the villages that have not achieved self-sufficiency in village funds are also formulating plans and trying to embark on the road of production self-sufficiency.

　　响应中央局厉行节约指示
  　三纵队缴获物资交公
  　和顺大部村庄财政生产自给民负大减
    【本报特讯】为积极响应中央局三月十五日关于厉行节约，渡过困难迎接光明的指示，三纵队已将战争缴获物资交公。三纵队自自卫战争以来，缴获法币一千○七十万元，银元一百一十个，碎银五十两，金戒指八个，首饰二十付，小米六万五千斤，麦子一万一千斤，布二百匹，全数交公，晋冀鲁豫军区特通报表扬。

    【本报讯】和顺在去年整顿地方财政中，共减轻人民粮款负担百分之二十八·九。成绩的获得，主要依靠生产盈利，整顿公产，加强地方收入。但村财政的负担，仍没有彻底减轻，并一度形成混乱。如去年村财政负担，约秋季屯公粮任务百分之九十九。为了保证自卫战争的胜利，克服此种畸形现象，政府对本年村财政负担，曾作精确计算，彻底整理，一面达到生产自给，一面做到紧缩开支。如村公所的规定是依据村庄大小，工作繁简，将全县各行政村按实际情况分做甲、乙、丙等三级，由县政府划分决定。村公所全年开支数，按规定等级掌握。为照顾实际情况，克服以往不合实际的限制开支，形成明里不摊暗里派现象，经过这次重新研究，任何村不能超过限定数目。并确定县村二级开支，不能超过边区粮款百分之十五为标准，而且各项开支各村不能乱起名目，制度以外，一律严禁开支。小学民校教员之等级，应由教育部门重做适当研究，等级不合者，可重新规定。开支数目，按等级供给，取缔以往自流状态。募捐今后应严格取消，任何村任何干部，不得借任何理由向群众动员，区村政府概无决定权。在征收制度上，一切正当粮款开支，由区公所拟订全年支出概算书，由县政府批准，始能向群众派征。在日常制度上，建立全村财政管理委员会，由村长、政治主任、财政委员三人组成之，做到由上而下批核，由下而上监督，每到月终向群众公布，每三月备案一次。如不经过公布备案手续，领导上及群众均可否认一切开支，年终进行决算。收支制度确定后，作了精确计算，今后规定全县村财政开支款五百八十万○一千一百元；开支米二千四百○七石八斗六升三合。
    此计划拟定后，该县王县长、李政委曾在生产动员大会上作了详细传达，使党政军民全体干部一致在思想上明确认识村财政的重要。并指出按成绩的大小作为评分立功条件之一。当场有松烟、暖窑、龙王、平地川、松沟、京上、北岭头、关家峪、砖窑、北关、河北、双鱼沟、青成、凤台、温源、郜村、百备、合山、土岭等十九个村首起模范保证。不但能够做到开支节流，更保证生产自给、不派群众一文。生产动员大会之后。经各村讨论研究，各自订出计划。现全县已有三分之二村庄做到生产自给，村款不直接取之于民，更能依照政府之制度不超支一文。其余三分之一未能村款自给村庄，亦正在拟订计划，各自设法，争取走上生产自给道路。
