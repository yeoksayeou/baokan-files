　　Dividing the Spoils
    Caring for the Elderly
    [This newspaper's Zuoquan dispatch] In the process of dividing the spoils in Yangjiao, attention was paid to caring for the elderly. In Yangjiao there is an old man named Guo Chunyang, who is sixty-five years old this year. He used to be an opera performer and doesn't know how to work. The villagers, considering his age, did not allocate land to him, but only allocated a house and other necessities, asking him to eat at different households in turn. However, this was very inconvenient. During this distribution of spoils, everyone discussed allocating him 60,000 yuan to invest in the cooperative, so that he could eat and clothe himself at the cooperative. In the end, only the profits could be spent, not the principal. The masses agreed to this, the cooperative also agreed, and old man Guo was very happy. (Zemin, Wanchun)

　　羊角分果实
    照顾老年人
    【本报左权讯】羊角分果实中，注意照顾老年人。羊角有个老汉郭春阳，今年六十五岁，他是个唱戏出身，不会劳动，村上人照顾他年纪大啦，没有给他分地，只给他分了房和其他东西，叫他挨户吃饭，但这样做也很不方便，这次分果实，大家讨论给他分了六万元，入到合作社，叫他去合作社吃、穿，最后算账只能花利，不能花本。这样群众同意，合作社也同意，郭老汉也很高兴。（泽民、万春）
