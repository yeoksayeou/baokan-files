　　Pingding Second Normal School Teachers and Students Run Elementary School Without Pay
　　[Our newspaper's Pingding dispatch] Since moving to Quwang last November, the Second Normal School of this county has been deeply involved in helping the masses to free themselves, participating in people's schools to lecture on current affairs, and conducting ideological education to consolidate the fruits of liberation, which has won the support of the masses. The teachers and students of the Second Normal School, unable to bear seeing the children of the village out of school, proposed to the village's mass cadres during the winter school to run an elementary school for Quwang without pay, reducing the burden on the masses. After discussion by the cadres and the masses, they were all delighted and said, "What we were hoping for was a Bodhisattva coming to our door," and it was quickly opened. The method is: the normal school has a teacher training class, and the elementary school is used as a practice elementary school for the students of the teacher training class of the school, to refine teacher resources and talents in practice. The specific methods are: 1. The overall leadership of the elementary school is the responsibility of the school. 2. In terms of teaching, students from the teacher training class take turns, two people per day, changing every week. 3. In addition to textbooks, the teaching materials emphasize "teach what is useful, teach what is done." The children go back and teach their families. The teaching materials must be prepared the day before, discussed and studied by the group, and reviewed by the school before being taught. 4. Students in the teacher training class learn while teaching, and must learn what they should learn every day. The elementary school students solve the difficulties according to the village situation, environment, family, etc., and what experiences they get, they discuss every night, and use them as educational research materials for the class to cultivate teacher talents who can truly serve the masses.

　　平定二高师生无薪办理小学
    【本报平定讯】本县二高自去年十一月移住曲望后，深入帮助群众翻身，并参加民校讲时事，进行思想教育，巩固翻身果实，颇得群众的拥护。二高师生不忍看着该村的儿童失学，就在冬学里向该村群众干部提出无薪制给曲望办理小学，减轻群众负担。当经干部群众讨论后，都很欢喜的说：“菩萨上门盼得是甚”，很快就开办起来了。其办法是：高校有师资班一班，把小学做为该校师资班学生的实验小学，从实际中＠炼师资人材。具体做法是：一、小学的总领导上是校部负责。二、在教学上由师资班学生轮流担任，每天两人，一周一换。三、教材除课本外，着重“用甚教甚，做甚教甚”。小孩回去教给家里人。每天教材要在前一天准备好，经过小组讨论研究和校部审查后再去教。四、师资班学生一面教一面学，每天必须把应学东西学会。小学方面由师资班学生根据村里情况环境家庭等不同设法去解决困难，得到些什么经验，每天晚上回来讨论，做为本班教育研究材料以培养真正能为群众服务的师资人材。
