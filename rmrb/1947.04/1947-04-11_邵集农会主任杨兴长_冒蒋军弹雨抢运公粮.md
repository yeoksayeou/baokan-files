　　Bravely Transports Public Grain Under Chiang Kai-shek's Bullet Fire
　　[This newspaper's Ji Lu Yu, 9th dispatch] Yang Xingchang, director of the Shaoji Agricultural Association in the Second District of Fan County, braved Chiang Kai-shek's bullet fire to complete the emergency transportation of public grain. Xingchang, who also serves as the Shuifeng ferry administrator, has been leading more than 20 sailors day and night for half a month to rush the transportation of public grain from the Sixth District of Shou Zhang. The sailors are divided into two groups for rotation, but Xingchang, undeterred by the hardship, participates personally every time. On the night of the 1st of this month, when he was leading four sailors to the east bank of the river to rush transportation, they were ambushed by Chiang Kai-shek's troops just as they had loaded the grain and were about to set off. Xingchang immediately directed the sailors to set sail, but the boat ran aground due to being overloaded. After their desperate efforts, they finally managed to push the boat into the middle of the river. The enemy's intimidation was ineffective, so they opened fire. Xingchang was wounded in the back, but despite the pain, he ordered the sailors to row, and commanded them, "Row! Even if we are killed, we cannot turn back!" Under the hail of bullets from Chiang Kai-shek's troops, they finally pushed the boat to the west bank, victoriously completing the emergency transportation of public grain. After Xingchang's exemplary deeds spread, cadres and masses from various villages rushed to express their condolences.

    冒蒋军弹雨抢运公粮
    【本报冀鲁豫九日电】范县二区邵集农会主任杨兴长冒蒋军弹雨完成公粮抢运。兴长兼任渡口水丰管理员，半月来，领导水手二十余人日夜抢运寿张六区的公粮。水手分两组轮流运输，但兴长不辞辛苦，每次都亲自参加。本月一日夜，他带四名水手往河东抢运时，装好粮食即将起程，突遭蒋军袭击，兴长当即指挥水手开船，但因装载过重而搁浅。经他们拚命撑，终于把船撑到中流。敌吓唬无效，即开枪射击，兴长背部负伤，但他不顾疼痛，仍命划浆，并命令水手说：“划呀！打死也不能撑回去！”在蒋军弹雨下，他们终于把船撑到西岸，胜利完成公粮的抢运。兴长的这一模范事迹传出后，各村干部群众纷纷赶来慰问。
