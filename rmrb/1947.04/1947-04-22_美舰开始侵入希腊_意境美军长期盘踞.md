Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, April 20th: According to a United Press report from Athens: A division of the US Navy arrived at Souda Bay, northern Crete, Greece on the 16th. This marks the beginning of US warships invading Greek territorial waters after Truman proposed a plan to interfere in Greek internal affairs.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, April 17th: TASS, Baghdad, April 15th: The "Da Siya Sa" newspaper recently commented on the American infiltration into Middle Eastern countries, stating: The purpose of American imperialism is to guarantee the interests of its oil companies in Arab countries. Forty-one percent of the oil shares are already in the hands of American oil companies. In Saudi Arabia alone, they control 420 square miles of oil fields, producing 7.5 million barrels of oil annually. American capital has penetrated deeply into Kuwait, Palestine, Syria, and Egypt. Truman's loans to the ruling cliques of Greece and Turkey are aimed at attempting to guarantee Turkey's leadership in the East and to strike a blow against the Turkish and Arab people.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, April 15th: TASS, Stockholm, April 13th: According to reports here: American officers and soldiers originally scheduled to be transported back home from Italy were ordered on April 11th to cease preparations for repatriation and to prepare to stay in Italy indefinitely. At the same time, Italy has begun to serve as a transportation station for the United States to send military equipment to Greece and Turkey in accordance with the Truman Plan.
