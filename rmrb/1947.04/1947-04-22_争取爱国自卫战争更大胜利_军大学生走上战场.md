    Strive for Greater Victory in the Patriotic Self-Defense War
    Military University Students Go to the Battlefield
    [Our Special Dispatch] The first class of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Military and Political University has successfully completed its educational mission and held a graduation ceremony on April 10th. More than ten units, including the Central Bureau of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Military Region of the Chinese Communist Party, the Military Region, the 5th, 10th, and 11th Military Sub-districts of Southern Hebei, the 38th Army of the Northwest Democratic Allied Army, and the Democratic National Construction Army, sent representatives with congratulatory banners and gifts from afar to participate in the celebration. The graduation ceremony lasted three days, exhibiting the achievements and experiences created in various tasks during the completion of this educational mission; live-ammunition exercises of village warfare and performances of the four major techniques were conducted, and a forum of model heroes was convened to exchange leadership methods of mass line implementation in mutual aid groups, squads, and companies. At the same time, awards and prizes were presented to forty-nine special-class study heroes who emerged in the heated learning movement, and over one hundred and forty first and second-class study heroes who emerged at the same time were commended. At the ceremony, Section Chief Xia, the representative of the Central Bureau and Military Region, conveyed the congratulations of the leaders of the Central Bureau and Military Region, saying: "This term's education, thanks to the correct leadership of the school's leaders at all levels, the hard work of all cadres and staff, and the diligent study of the students, has finally achieved a great victory. This victory is of equal significance to the annihilation of many enemies at the front." Deputy Principal Xu Shenji encouraged everyone to resolutely obey orders, strictly abide by discipline, and forever inherit the glorious tradition of hard struggle and heroic sacrifice of the alma mater, to go to the front to kill enemies and make meritorious contributions, and to win honor for the alma mater; in particular, all study heroes should forever maintain their heroic titles and add merit to merit. The graduating students gave a resounding response to these hopes: all students of the ten classes of the First and Second Detachments voluntarily signed and sealed a guarantee to the organization that they would resolutely obey assignments, and would go happily wherever work was needed, without haggling in the slightest. In their reply, the graduating students said: "Going to the front, we will resolutely complete all tasks, fear no difficulties, kill more enemies, and thoroughly eliminate the traitor Chiang Kai-shek's invading army." They all raised their fists and swore to the people before the portrait of Chairman Mao: "With absolute loyalty, we will make contributions for the people, and we must strive to be work models and enemy-killing heroes!"
