　　Soviet Labor Newspaper Exposes
    De Gaulle's Plot to Split France
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 15th] TASS, Moscow: The Labor newspaper states: De Gaulle's name, which had been silent for a while, has reappeared in French newspapers. In his recent speeches while touring France, he crudely attacked French democracy and the Resistance movement, denied the mass nature of the French people's struggle against the invaders and the role of its most active force—the working class and the Communist Party. He also criticized the constitution and government voted on by referendum. He openly recommended himself as the savior of France. Left-wing parties and their newspapers pointed out that the characteristics of these speeches are dangerous to the Republic, that this is an open call for the division of the French people and a call for anti-democratic rebellion, in order to establish a personal dictatorship. The newspaper continued: The real liberators of France are the French people themselves and the vanguard of the people who led the national liberation struggle—the working class. French democratic groups sternly oppose this attempt to restore a reactionary regime.

　　苏联劳动报揭露
    戴高乐图分裂法国
    【新华社陕北十五日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：劳动报称：沉寂了一时的戴高乐的大名，又复在法国各报上出现了。他这次周游法国各地讲演，粗暴地攻击法国民主及反抗运动，否认了法国人民反抗侵略者斗争的群众性以及其最积极的力量——工人阶级及共产党的作用，他更抨击了由公民投票表决的宪法和政府。他公开地自荐为法国救世主。左派政党及其机关报指出这些讲演的特点对于共和国是危险的，这是公开地让法国人民分裂，号召反民主的叛乱，为了建立个人独裁。该报继称：法国真正的解放者是法国人民自己和领导过民族解放斗争的人民先锋队——工人阶级。法国民主团体严峻地反对这种恢复反动政体的企图。
