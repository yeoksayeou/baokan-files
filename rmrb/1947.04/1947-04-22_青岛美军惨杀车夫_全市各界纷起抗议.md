Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th. According to an Associated Press report: Qingdao Shandong University students have recently launched an anti-American movement, triggered by the shooting and killing of a Chinese rickshaw driver by a U.S. Navy sailor in Qingdao. Students held rallies, sending telegrams to the Nanjing government, the U.S. Embassy, and the United Nations, demanding the swift withdrawal of U.S. troops from China, compensation for the rickshaw driver's family, and an apology. Student marches and demonstrations were prevented from taking place by the Qingdao Chiang government.

Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 19th. (Delayed) The details of the brutal murder of a Chinese rickshaw driver by U.S. military personnel in Qingdao are as follows: On the evening of the 10th of last month, at 8:00 PM, U.S. soldier Abila Baideluo rode a rickshaw to the Guangshe Ballroom. Upon alighting, he refused to pay the fare. When the rickshaw driver, Su Mingcheng, asked for payment, the soldier drew his knife and stabbed Su in the lower abdomen, penetrating more than half a foot deep, causing profuse bleeding. After committing the act, the U.S. soldier acted as if nothing had happened, striding proudly into the ballroom. Su, wounded, followed him into the room, but collapsed and died due to the severity of his injuries, causing an uproar among onlookers. After the dance ended, as the U.S. soldier exited, he was captured by a group of rickshaw drivers who intended to take him to the police station. At this moment, a U.S. military truck arrived, attempting to help the murderer escape. However, they were surrounded by the crowd and were forced to hand him over to the U.S. military police headquarters. The entire city was outraged upon hearing the news, and protests erupted. The Chiang party authorities in Qingdao refused to investigate, causing extreme indignation among the citizens.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th. According to an Associated Press report from Shanghai on the 15th: Two lawyers from the American Texasali (transliteration) Company operating in China were detained for ten and a half hours on the 14th by students from Shanghai National University. The detention occurred after the two went there to discuss demands regarding a student from the university being killed by a company truck. The two, Fu Si and Zhou Guangwei (transliterations), were released after Shanghai Mayor Wu Guozhen advised the students to resolve the incident through "peaceful negotiations" that evening. Upon arriving at the university, they were surrounded by students, who punctured the tires of their car. The students initially demanded that the company's general manager be held as a "hostage," but Wu Guozhen intervened. The students presented the company with numerous demands, including a "compensation fee" of 635 million Legal Tender currency.

    【新华社陕北十四日电】据美联社电称：青岛山东大学学生近展开反美运动，起因为青岛美国水兵枪杀中国人力车夫一名。学生们举行集会，致电南京政府及美国大使馆与联合国，要求美军迅速自华撤退，并赔偿车夫家属及进行道歉。学生之游行示威计划，由于青岛蒋政府阻止未能实现。
    【新华社山东十九日电】（迟到）青岛所发生之美军惨杀中国人力车夫血案，据查经过如下：上月十日晚八时，美兵阿必拉白德罗乘人力车至广社舞厅，下车后不付车资，车夫苏明诚向其索取，彼竟拔出佩刀猛然刺入苏之小腹深半尺余，血流如注。该美兵行凶后犹旁若无人，昂首阔步直入舞厅。苏负伤尾追至室内，因伤势过重倒地毙命，路人大哗。舞场散场后，该美兵刚出门，即为一群车夫捕捉，拟解警局。此时忽驶来一美军用卡车，企图载凶手逃逸。后被群众包围，始被迫将其解往美宪兵司令部。全市闻讯愤怒异常，纷起抗议。青市蒋党局竟推托不问，市民极为愤慨。
    【新华社陕北十六日电】据美联社上海十五日电称：在华开设之美国得克萨利（译音）有限公司两名律师，十四日被上海国立大学学生扣留十个半钟头。扣留系在二人赴彼处讨论关于该大学某学生为公司货车撞毙事所提要求后发生。当晚时记上海市的吴国桢劝告学生们以“和平谈判”解决此一事件后，二人始被释放。二人为伏斯与周光卫（译音）。当他们到达该大学时，即为学生们包围，并将汽车轮胎刺破。学生们首先要求该公司总经理做“人质”，但遭吴国桢干涉。学生们对公司提出了许多要求，包括六亿三千五百万元法币之“赔偿费”。
