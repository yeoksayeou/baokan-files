　　Striving for Dye Self-Sufficiency
    Border Region Government Establishes Review and Award Committee
    [This Newspaper Reports] To implement the policy of striving for dye self-sufficiency, the Dye Review and Award Committee of the Border Region Government has been formally established and has begun operations. The committee is composed of seven members: Sun Wenshu, Secretary-General of the Border Region Government; Fan Ruoyi, Director of the Construction Department; Liu Yuchen, Deputy Director of the Construction Department and chemical industry expert; Xu Daben, Director of the Border Region Industry and Mining Bureau; Liu Daifeng, Director of the Border Region Trade Bureau; Wang Yinggu, chemical industry expert; and Ma Mingsan, technician. The tasks of the committee are to test, review, and research various improved and invented dyes. If the review confirms success, it will submit opinions to relevant departments on organizing manufacturing and promotion, and determine the level of awards, amounts, medals, and certificates to be awarded. The daily administrative work of the committee, as well as external communication and liaison, will be concurrently handled by the Construction Department of the Border Region Government. Currently, the committee has begun collecting local indigenous dyes and entrusted the Yongsheng Chemical Industry Cooperative of the Border Region Government to conduct testing and research, and has sent letters to various administrative offices to strengthen work coordination. Committee member Liu Yuchen is also in contact with the Engineering College of Peking University to combine efforts and organize testing and research work.
    [Further News] Comrades from the Construction Department of the Border Region Government, based on past experience and recently collected materials for the manufacture and use of indigenous dyes, have put forward the following opinions on the future development of indigenous dyes: (1) Indigenous dyes are mostly extracted from plants, some using leaves, some using roots or stems, and bark, mostly produced in mountainous areas. It is easier for the masses in the producing areas to use them. Promotion and export are limited by transportation difficulties, and harvesting has seasonality. Sooner or later, it affects the size of the dyeing content. (2) Black leaves for dyeing black, tigerwood for dyeing green, and yellow beeswax for dyeing yellow can all be boiled in water to extract the color and made into a paste. The Zuoquan area has widely used black leaves to boil paste, which is very convenient to store or transport to various places, and the cost is very low, which can be promoted. (3) The output of alum in our region is very large, and the production of alkali has been successful. All alum alkali can be solved. If scientific experiments are carried out using a certain amount of dye in combination with a certain amount of alkali and alum, the dyeing procedure may be as simple as using foreign indigo, and it may also reduce the shortcomings of being scorched by alkali and corroded by alum, causing the cloth to be less durable.

　　争取染料自给
    边府成立审查评奖委员会
    【本报讯】边府为贯彻争取染料自给的方针，染料审查评奖委员会已正式成立，并开始办公。该委员会由边区政府孙文淑秘书长、建设厅长范若一、建设厅副厅长化学工业专家刘雨辰、边区工矿局局长徐达本、边区贸易总局局长刘岱峰、化学工业专家王膺固、马铭三技师等七人组成之。该委员会之任务为化验、审查、研究各种改良与发明之染料，经审查确实成功的，向有关部门提出组织制造及推广意见，评定应奖励之等次、金额、奖章、奖状等专项。该委员会之日常事务工作，及对外之通讯联络等，均由边区政府建设厅兼理。现该会已着手搜集各地已有之土染料，委托边府永生化学工业社化验研究，并分函各行署加强工作上的联系。该会刘雨辰委员并与北大工学院接洽，互相结合，组织化验研究工作。
    【又讯】边府建设厅同志们根据已往经验及最近搜集到的土染料制造使用材料，进行研究，对今后土制染料的发展问题，提出以下意见：（一）土染料多从植物中提炼出来，有的用叶有的用根或茎、皮，大部产在山地。产地群众采用较易，推广输出，受交通困难限制且采择有季节性，或迟或早都影响到染色的含量大小。（二）染黑色的黑叶、染绿色的老虎柴、染黄色的黄腊腊等都能用水煮下颜色来，熬成膏子。左权一带已普遍用黑叶熬膏，膏子贮藏、或向各地输送都很方便，成本很低可以推广。（三）本区矾的产量很大，制碱已成功，矾碱全部可以解决，如经科学的试验用一定数量的染料配合一定数量的碱和矾，染布手续可能和洋靛一样的简便，也可能减少被碱炙矾蚀，布因而不耐穿的缺点。
