　　The Battle of Ronghe
    Cui Jingxiu
    On the night of April 8th, the Jinnan People's Liberation Army launched a surprise attack on Ronghe. When they reached the outskirts of Ronghe, it was already broad daylight and they were discovered by the enemy. In order to confuse the enemy, they deliberately retreated more than twenty li. The enemy then loudly proclaimed that "the Communist army was routed and retreated eastward..." The puppet government ordered the masses to offer their condolences to the defending troops, and reported the so-called "victory" to the Commissioner of the 15th Special District of Yuncheng and to Taiyuan. Sure enough, Yan Xishan hurriedly sent one million yuan in consolation and encouragement by plane, and Commissioner Xie Kejian also wrote a letter of commendation. Letters from the military and political organs of Yuncheng followed one after another. As a result, Xue Zihua shamelessly told the people, "This time, the rebels have been driven back by us, and they are guaranteed not to come for three months." Originally, the Ronghe enemy had been preparing to escape a few days earlier, but the arrogant Xue rebel changed his plan and even more shamelessly exhausted his ability to commit adultery, plunder, and loot.

    Just as the Ronghe enemy was in high spirits, the People's Liberation Army suddenly approached the city walls at midnight on the 12th. The enemy panicked and climbed the city walls, tying ropes around their waists, preparing to jump off the city and escape.

    At 2:00 AM, the battle began. Our flares danced in the air, and mountain guns, mortars, and heavy and light machine guns spewed flames, all rushing forward. The enemy on the city tower lit cotton soaked in oil and threw hand grenades from time to time. The ladder team of the third platoon of our ninth company, fearlessly approached the city wall, cut through two layers of iron netting, and erected the ladders. Combat heroes Duan Derong, Song Tianming, Su Yuefei, and soldier Liu Jiqiang drove the enemy on the city tower to the northeast corner, opening up the road of attack for the entire company, and quickly pushed the enemy to the west gate, capturing more than a hundred enemies alive. The eighth company rushed along the east-west streets, crushing the enemy's counterattack. The enemy ran to the police station, and the eighth company pursued and charged straight in, forcing more than fifty enemies to lay down their arms. The enemy fleeing from the east city wall was again encircled and annihilated by our ambushing troops. At this time, the puppet regimental headquarters near the south gate attempted to hold on. Instructor Fan led the seventh company, charging into the courtyard with fierce firepower. After a burst of intense hand grenades, all the enemies surrendered their guns. When our army attacked the regimental headquarters, Xue Zihua was wounded and, like a rat, burrowed into the drain of the west city wall. In the midst of the shouts of killing that shook the mountains, he could not control himself and fainted. When he woke up, he had become a prisoner of the People's Army. County Magistrate Li Xushou, with his dog-jumping-over-the-wall "wisdom", jumped down from the north city wall, and happened to jump into the encirclement of the People's Liberation Army. Yan Xishan and Xie Kejian's award telegrams were still in Li Xushou's pocket, and together with the bonuses, became the trophies of the People's fighters.

　　荣河之战
    崔敬修
    四月八日夜，晋南人民解放军奇袭荣河。当到达荣河城郊，天已大明，被敌人发觉。为了迷惑敌人，故意后撤二十余里，敌人便大吹大擂的贴布告说：“共军溃不成军，向东撤退……”。伪政府勒令群众向守城部队慰劳，并向运城十五专署专员及太原报告了所谓“胜利”。果然，阎锡山赶忙派飞机送来了一百万元慰劳鼓励金，专员谢克俭也写信嘉奖，运城军政机关信件更接踵而来。于是薛子华便大言不惭的向老百姓说：“这次叛军被我们打退，保险三月不会来。”本来荣河敌人在几天前就准备逃跑，但骄傲的薛逆，竟改变了计划，而且更加荒淫无耻的极尽其奸淫搜刮、掠夺之能事。
    正当荣河敌人兴高彩烈之际，人民解放军突于十二日夜十二时逼近城垣。敌人惊慌失措的爬上城墙，把绳子捆在腰上，准备跳城逃跑。
    晨二时，战斗开始了，我们的照明弹在空中飞舞，山炮、迫击炮、重轻机枪喷放出火焰，一齐扑去。城楼的敌人把蘸了油的棉花燃着，并不时投下手雷，我九连三排梯子组，奋不顾身的接近城根，斩断两层铁网，把梯子立起来。战斗英雄段得荣、宋天明、苏岳飞与战士刘吉强，把城楼上的敌人驱逐到东北角，给全连开辟了进攻的道路，很快把敌人压到西门，活捉了百余敌人。八连沿着东西大街冲垮了敌人的反击，敌人跑到警察所，八连尾追直冲，迫使五十余敌人放下武器。东城墙逃窜之敌又遭我预伏部队的围歼。此时南门附近的伪团部，企图固守。范教导员带领的七连，以勇猛火力冲进院内，一阵激烈的手榴弹后，所有的敌人都缴了枪。当我军攻打团部时，薛子华负了伤，像老鼠一样，钻到西城墙的水道中，在我军声震山谷的喊杀声中，他不能自持的昏过去了，当他清醒过来，已作了人民军队的俘虏。县长李绪守以他狗急跳墙的“智慧”，由北城墙上跳下去，恰巧跳在人民解放军的圈子里。阎锡山和谢克俭的奖电，还在李绪守衣袋里，连同奖金一起成了人民战士胜的利品。
