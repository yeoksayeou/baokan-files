Xinhua News Agency, Jinji-Luyu, 23rd: The militia guerrilla warfare along the Taiyue Tongpu Railway and the Yellow River has recently seen new developments. The number of enemies annihilated by the militia is increasing daily, averaging about 2,000 per month. Specifically, it shows the following characteristics: First, guerrilla warfare has truly become a mass war to protect land and homes. Various localities have launched guerrilla warfare on the basis of anti-"counter-settlement" (反“倒算”), and have launched land reform movements under the cover of guerrilla warfare. On the new basis of land reform, the entire population supports the militia with all its strength. The young and strong fight in the front, while the old and women make stone mines, scout, sentry, and even cheer for the fighting militia. In Yibi Village, Hongdong, a young man was fighting on the roof, and his father shouted in the courtyard, "Hold off the enemy, if you can't hold them off, you are not my son, you are just a useless good-for-nothing!" Qishi Village, the second "Du Ba Lian" in Jiyuan, under the leadership of an old lady surnamed ×, organized an intelligence station including a dozen old men and women, which made the militia well-informed and won surprise victories, drove away the enemies from nearby Nanguanzhuang and Gao Village, and opened up the situation within the grid network. On March 18th, the Kai Xi Heng Yu militia was surrounded by the enemy. The masses in the village took wooden sticks and shoulder poles, and some took axes, and attacked from all directions, like chasing wolves, with a clamorous sound, scaring away the die-hard bandits and rescuing the militia. Second, from absolute decentralized operations to a combination of decentralization and centralization. In the War of Resistance Against Japan, decentralized sparrow warfare has developed into necessary centralized operations, from not leaving the village at any time to necessary expeditions, from joint village defense to joint district defense, and joint county defense. In terms of tactics, decentralization is generally used to deal with centralization, and centralization is used to deal with decentralization. In the grid network, the method of "multiple decentralization and unified command" is adopted. Decentralization and centralization change with the situation; when cooperating with the main force, there is a certain degree of centralization. For example, when our army attacked Yicheng and Taishan Temple on April 5th, the Yicheng militia gathered more than 1,000 people, divided into more than a dozen groups, to capture the fleeing enemies, and captured 91 people including the commander and deputy commander of the enemy's 5th Security Regiment. Third, from reckless charging and hard fighting, to a combination of courage and wisdom; the militia has demonstrated a high degree of creativity. Many resourceful and courageous people's military commanders have emerged. The following four tactics were created: (1) Combination of thunder mines and guns. Landmines have long become a "tiger" that enemies fear. The combination of thunder mines and guns is even more "like a tiger with wings." When the Pingyao militia relied only on reckless charging and ignored landmines, the ratio of enemy and our casualties was three to one. Later, when the combination of thunder mines and guns was used to launch explosions, the ratio of enemy and our casualties immediately changed to six or five to one. In the use of landmines, it has also developed from ground mines at night to aerial mines and underwater mines, from individual mine laying to joint district mines, and from thunder mine and gun blockade to flying explosions and thunder mine and gun attacks. (2) Hornet warfare, that is, when a shot is fired in one place, reinforcements come from all directions. This was produced after the land reform, under the understanding of "farmers all over the world are one family." On February 6th, the Shulong Zhongliang militia came into contact with the enemy. As soon as a shot was fired, the militia from various villages in the Second District and the First District, Xiliang, Xiaoguo and other villages rushed to the scene upon hearing the alarm, launching hornet warfare. Guns were fired everywhere for a while, and the enemy fled in panic. (3) "Black Tiger Digs the Heart" warfare; that is, bypassing the enemy's sentry outposts, attacking the enemy's heart, and capturing the ringleaders and bullies. The Lingshi militia bypassed the enemy's heavy blockade line, went straight to the outposts around the city, and captured Wu Daolong, the commander of the enemy's "Struggle Regiment" alive; the Jiyuan Du Bal Lian militia secretly crossed the Yellow River, attacked the Xitan outpost on the south bank of Henan, captured 13 enemies, and burned two enemy planes in the Yellow River beach. The "digging the heart" warfare eliminates the enemy at a small price and gives the enemy a major mental threat. (4) Roadside capture warfare, either ambushing on important roads or using disguise to injure and capture the enemy and puppets coming and going. The Gaoda combat team ambushed on the roadside and killed an enemy regimental commander. Hou Wenqing, a militia from Xinjiang, disguised himself as an enemy and captured 12 enemies five times on the Dongzhen Road in Hongdong. Because of this kind of roadside capture, the enemies along the Tongpu Railway often dare not take the railway and detour to the west of the Fen River.

　　男女老幼全体参加保田保家
    太岳各线游击战大发展 
    涌现大批智勇双全的人民军事家
    创造雷枪结合马蜂战等四种战术
    【新华社晋冀鲁豫二十三日电】太岳同蒲沿线与黄河沿岸的民兵游击战争，近来又有新的发展，民兵歼敌数量日增，每月平均在两千左右。具体显示出以下几个特点：第一、游击战已真正成为保田保家的群众战争。各地在反“倒算”的基础上展开了游击战争，又在游击战的掩护下展开土地改革运动。并在土地改革新的基础上，全体群众以全力支援民兵，青壮年在前面打仗，老人、妇女打石雷、侦察、放哨、以至给作战的民兵呐喊助威。洪洞伊壁村一个青年在房上打仗，他父亲在院子里面叫：“顶住敌人，顶不住你就不是我的儿，就是软胎子货！”济源的第二个“杜八联”沁市村在×老太太领导下，组织了包括十几个老汉、老婆的情报站，从而使民兵消息灵通，奇袭获胜，赶跑了附近南官庄、高村的敌人，打开了格子网内的局面。三月十八日，开喜横榆民兵被敌包围，该村群众有的拿木棍、扁担，有的拿斧头，四面八方打去，像赶狼一样，一片喧嚷之声，吓跑顽匪，救出民兵。第二、由绝对分散作战开展到分散与集中的结合。抗日战争中，分散的麻雀战，发展成为必要的集中作战，由时时不离本村发展为必要的远征作战，由联村联防发展成为联区联防，联县联防。在战术上，一般是以分散对付集中，以集中对付分散。在格子网内，则采用“多头分散，统一指挥”。分散与集中是随情况的变化而变化；在配合主力作战时，则一定程度的集中。如四月五日我军攻打翼城及太山庙时，翼城民兵即集中了一千余人，分成十多个集团，捕捉逃窜的敌人，抓住敌保五团正副团长等九十一名。第三、由猛冲硬打，发展为勇敢与智谋结合；民兵发挥了高度的创造性。出现了许多智勇双全的人民的军事指挥家。创造了以下四种战术：（一）雷枪结合，地雷早已成为敌人谈虎色变的“老虎”，雷与枪结合起来更是“如虎生翼”。平遥民兵在只凭猛冲，轻视地雷的时候，敌我伤亡的比例是三比一，后来应由雷枪结合，展开爆炸，敌我伤亡的比例马上变为六或五比一。在地雷的运用上，亦由黑夜的地面雷发展为空中雷、水中雷，由个别埋雷发展为联区雷，由雷枪封锁发展为飞行爆炸，雷枪进攻。（二）马蜂战，即一处枪响，四面增援，这是经过土地改革，在“天下农民是一家”的认识下产生的。二月六日，术隆中梁民兵与敌接触，枪声一响，二区各村及一区、西梁、小郭等村民兵闻警赶到，展开马蜂战，一时枪声四起，敌慌忙逃窜。（三）“黑虎掏心”战；即绕过敌人前哨据点，奔袭敌人心脏，捕捉首要及奸霸分子，灵石民兵绕过敌重重封锁线，直捣城周据点，活捉敌“奋斗团”团长吴道龙；济源杜八联民兵偷渡黄河，奔袭河南岸西滩据点，俘敌十三人，并在黄河滩中烧毁敌飞机两架。掏心战以小的代价消灭敌人，而且给敌人精神上以重大的威胁。（四）拦路捕捉战，或要路设伏或以伪装杀伤捕捉来往的敌伪，高达战斗队，埋伏到路边，打死敌人一个团长，新绛民兵侯文清，伪装敌人，在洪洞东镇道上，五次俘敌十二名。由于这种拦路捕捉，常常使同蒲沿线的敌人不敢走铁路，而绕道汾河以西。
