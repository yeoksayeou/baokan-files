    Textile Hero Zhao Chunhua
    Leads in Drafting Plans to Prosper
    [This Dispatch from Zuoquan] Taihang First Class Textile Hero Zhao Chunhua, at the county's production mobilization meeting, spoke in detail about her long-planned prosperity plan, prompting all cadres to make precise calculations, preparing to return to their villages and lead the masses in drafting their own prosperity plans. (1) Personal Prosperity Plan: (1) Calculate family assets, the whole family recognized the difficulties. The whole family of twelve, except for the man working and the eldest son serving in the army and consuming resources elsewhere, the remaining ten were the responsibility of the family. Last year, not a single walnut was harvested, only 45 *shi* of coarse grains were harvested. After deducting family consumption, the second and third sons lived in colleges, requiring 5 *shi* of millet annually. The sheep labor wage was 5 *shi*, and the cattle labor wage was 9 *dou*, totaling 10 *shi* and 9 *dou* of millet, leaving nothing else. In addition, the whole family's annual salt consumption and the children's school books and food expenses required more than 50,000 *yang*, plus the contributions and *chenghua* (50 *jin*) also required 30,000 *yang*, totaling a shortage of 10 *shi* and 9 *dou* of millet and over 80,000 *yang* for the whole year. (2) Democratic discussion, devised remedies. A family meeting was convened, and the discussion resulted in the children continuing their studies. The deficit could only be made up through production. It was unanimously decided to raise two sows, which would produce 20 piglets a year. Including the sows, this would earn 60,000 *yang*, enough to cover the family's salt and the children's stationery expenses. Turning 50 *jin* of cotton into cloth, deducting 30 *jin* for self-use, and selling the 20 *jin* of cloth would make up for the cattle and sheep labor costs and the millet for the children's studies. The 45 *shi* of grain harvested at home would be more than enough for eight people's consumption and *chenghua* contributions. (3) Summary of achievements, proposed directions. In addition to mobilizing and drafting this year's production plan at the family meeting, Zhao Chunhua also summarized the achievements of the past three years of prosperity, including buying 30 sheep, 3 cattle, building six new houses, making two weaving machines, buying coffins for the in-laws, marrying off the eldest son, and investing 50,000 *yang* in the cooperative. Based on this foundation, she proposed the direction for the next three years: "In terms of living standards, improve to the pre-war wealthy peasant level, strive to buy three more cattle, and replace all the family's houses with newly built ones." (2) The village's textile movement has long been organized under the direct leadership of Zhao Chunhua, forming a textile cooperative with a total of nine machines, absorbing 100% of the village's women, totaling 68 people, divided into five groups, with her serving as the director and technician. For long-term consideration, a group (ten) of girls aged fifteen to seventeen were specifically organized to leave production and apprentice in the cooperative. She said at the county conference this time: "The girls of our Shuipo have all learned the skills, not only laying the foundation for our village's textile industry in the future, but also making it easy for the children to find a marriage partner."

    纺织英雄赵春花
    带头订发家计划
    【本报左权讯】太行一等纺织英雄赵春花，在全县生产动员大会上，详细谈出她早已订出的发家计划，推动了全体干部都作了精确计算，准备回村后领导群众都订出发家计划来。（一）个人发家计划：（１）算家当，全家认识了困难。全家十二口人，除男人工作，大儿参军消耗在外，其余十口人都由家庭负责，去年核桃一个未收，只打了粗粮四十五石，除家庭消耗、二儿、三儿都住高校，年需小米五石，羊工工资五石，牛工工资九斗，共十石九斗小米，就没有指项。另外全家一年吃盐和孩们住学的书籍费菜金共需洋五万多元，再加上出款和秤花（五十斤）也得大洋三万元，总共全年还缺小米十石九斗，大洋八万余元。（２）民主讨论，想出了补救办法。召开家庭会，讨论结果叫孩们继续念书，亏空只有用生产来补救，一致决定喂母猪两口，一年生廿个小猪，连母猪就赚洋六万元，便够全家吃盐与孩们文具费用。把五十斤花变成布，除三十斤自穿外，二十斤布卖了补起牛羊工与小孩念书吃的小米，家里打下四十五石粮只供八口人吃与秤花出款也就足足有余。（３）总结成绩，提出方向。赵春花在家庭会上除做了动员订出今年生产计划外，还总结了前三年发家的成绩，计买羊三十只，牛三头，新盖房子六间，制织布机两架，还给翁婆买下了寿木板两付，给大儿结了婚，合作社还入股五万元。根据这个基础，她提出今后三年的方向“生活上提高到战前富农生活水平，争取再买三头牛，全家人都换成新盖的”。（二）全村纺织运动早已在赵春花直接领导下组织起纺织合作社，共九架机，吸收了全村百分之百妇女参加，共六十八人，分五个小组，由她任社长和技师。为了长期打算，专门组织了一批（十个）十五岁至十七岁的闺女，脱离生产，在社内学徒。她这次在县里大会上说：“俺水坡的闺女都学下了本领，不但给俺村今后打下纺织的基础，就是孩们找个对象结婚也很容易。”（印龙）
