    Caring for the Village's Labor Shortage
    Xishan Military Dependents Decline Substitute Farming
    [This newspaper's Taihang dispatch, 23rd] To allow soldiers at the front to fight with peace of mind, the masses in Shangxishan Village, Yushe First District, first delivered manure to the military dependents. The entire village needed substitute farming for more than 50 mu of land. The entire populace spent three mornings delivering more than 350 loads of manure to the military dependents. The military dependents were very happy and all wrote letters to their children at the front saying, "This year, the land is being cultivated even better than when you were at home." Since the beginning of spring, the entire village has delivered more than 3,000 loads of manure to the military dependents. Military dependent Pei Sanhuo, taking into account the village's labor shortage, voluntarily proposed: "Everyone is taking care of me, and I must also take care of the masses. Although I am 55 years old, I can still move around. I am willing to cultivate the 20 mu of land that was substitute farmed last year myself this year." The masses were all moved by his actions and immediately proposed, "You cultivate the land, and we will still help with hoeing and wheat harvesting." This also influenced other military dependents, such as Pei Sanhai and Wan Shubao, who also refused substitute farming by the masses. This not only took care of the military dependents but also solved the labor shortage.

    照顾村里劳力困难
    西山军属谢绝代耕
    【本报太行二十三日电】榆社一区上西山村群众为了使前方战士安心打仗，先给军属送粪。全村需要代耕的地有五十余亩，全体群众三个早晨就给军属送了三百五十担粪，军属非常高兴，都给前线子弟写信说：“今年的地比你们在家时还种的好。”开春以来，全村已给军属送粪三千多担。军属裴三货照顾村里劳力困难，自觉的提出：“大家照顾我，我也要照顾群众，现在我虽五十五岁，还能动弹，我情愿将去年代耕的二十亩地，今年自己耕种”。群众都为他的行动所感动，即提出“地你种上，在锄苗割麦时，我们还要帮助”。同时也影响了其他军属，如裴三孩、万书保等均拒绝了群众代耕，这样既照顾了军属，又解决了劳力困难。
