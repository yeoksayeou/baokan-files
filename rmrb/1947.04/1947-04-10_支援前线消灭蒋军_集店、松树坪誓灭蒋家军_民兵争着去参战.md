　　Support the Front Lines to Eliminate Chiang's Troops
    Ji Dian and Songshuping Vow to Wipe Out Chiang Kai-shek's Army
  　Militiamen Vie to Join the War
    [Our Newspaper, Huguan News] After the land investigation movement, the masses in Jidian Village, District One, have greatly raised their consciousness and enthusiasm to resist Japan and save the country. After the village militia received the order from the District Command to participate in the war, all the militiamen were very happy and unanimously signed up to go to the front line to eliminate the Chiang bandits. Cheng Fuxiang and Zhang Xiaoqi, the chairman and vice-chairman of the Farmers' Association, said: "This time I go to the front line, I will first tie up the landlords in our village, the little Chiang Kai-sheks Wu Dingli, Wu Ziying, and Wu Bushui, and we will thoroughly settle the old scores with them." Wang Rubao said: "Although I have a sore on my leg, I have to go." Zhang Xiaoqi and Cui Xiaodui said: "This time I go out, I must work hard and strive to become a hero in killing the enemy." In this way, except for the militiamen who were currently ill, all the healthy militiamen were vying to go to the front line. The director of the Armed Forces Committee said: "This time to participate in the war, the District Command stipulates that not everyone can go, and some people must be left at home to produce." But no one wanted to stay at home, so they had to go to the District Command, where the district slowly explained and left two people behind. Yang Huaiyou said: "Although I am not a militiaman, I must go to the war to fight Chiang Kai-shek." Yang Changhai, Wu Youze and others also signed up one after another, vying to go to the front line to carry stretchers. The masses' enthusiasm for participating in the war is very high, and they all agree that "If you want the grass not to grow, you have to dig up the old roots." The masses at home said to the masses participating in the war: "This time you go to participate in the war, fight the enemy with peace of mind, and we will be responsible for the land at home. We will plant it for you first and ensure that it is planted well." In this way, the entire village implemented a large-scale work exchange between the front and rear. (Huaibao, Guoqing, Defu)
    [Our Newspaper, Zuoquan News] After the third review in Songshuping, District Three, the peasants have completely turned over, and honest peasants Li Yuxi and eleven others, along with the lazy man Zhao Jincheng, have all become activists. At the mass meeting, after the instructor read the news in the newspaper about Chiang's bandit jumping over the wall in desperation, the peasants who had turned over said in unison: "Our village has struggled against the landlords three times, and we have overthrown the little Chiang Kai-shek and removed his roots, but there is still the big Chiang destroying our liberation and attacking the place where our Chairman Mao lives. It is really 'a toad wanting to eat swan meat.' If we don't wipe out the Chiang bandits completely, we really can't live in peace." Then Zhao Jincheng and Zhao Yuxi and twenty-one others signed up to join the militia. The sixty-three-year-old Li Jinyang also happily signed up to join the militia, saying: "I am old but my heart is not old. I can't hold a gun, but I can cook for the militia." At that time, the militia comrades praised the old man's good spirit. Hearing about participating in the war, the peasants who had turned over were scrambling to go. Finally, it was decided that some people should be left at home to take care of planting. (Xiuzeng, Yutian)

　　支援前线消灭蒋军
    集店、松树坪誓灭蒋家军
  　民兵争着去参战
    【本报壶关讯】一区集店村经过查田运动，群众觉悟空前提高。该村民兵接到区指挥部，参战命令后，全体民兵非常高兴，都一致报名争着上前线消灭蒋贼。农会正副主任程福祥、张小气说：“我这次上前线要先把咱村地主小蒋介石吴鼎立、吴子英、吴补水捆来，咱们和他彻底算老账。”王如保说：“我腿上虽有个疮，也非去不行。”张小气、崔小堆说：“我这次出去，一定要努力干，争取当杀敌英雄。”这样，除了现有病的民兵外，健壮民兵都是争着上前线，武委会主任说：“这次参战，区指挥部规定不能都去，还得留人在家生产。”但叫谁在家谁也不愿意，结果还是到区指挥部，区里才慢慢的解释，留下了二个。杨怀有说：“我虽不是民兵，我确要去参战打蒋介石。”杨昌孩、吴有则等也先后报名，争着上前线抬担架。群众参战情绪非常高涨，都一致认为“要想草不生，还得刨掉老根。”在家的群众对参战的群众说：“你们这次去参战，安心打敌人，家里的土地由我们负责，先给你们种，保证种好。”这样，前后方实行了全村大变工。（怀保、国庆、德富）
    【本报左权讯】三区松树坪三次复查后，农民翻透了身，老实农民李玉喜等十一人和大懒汉赵金成一齐变成了积极分子。在群众大会上，教员读了报上载蒋贼狗急跳墙消息后，翻身农民同声说：“咱村三次斗争地主，把小蒋斗倒，去了根，可是还有大蒋破坏咱翻身，还进攻咱毛主席住的地方，真是‘癞蛤蟆想吃天鹅蛋’。不把蒋贼消灭净，咱们真不能过安生日子。”接着赵金成和赵玉喜等二十一人报名参加民兵。六十三岁的李金羊老汉也笑喜喜的报名加入民兵，他说：“我人老心不老，不能拿枪杆，也能给民兵做饭。”当时民兵同志们表扬了老汉的好精神。听说参战，翻身农民都抢着要去，最后决定还要留些人在家闹养种。（秀曾、玉田）
