[This article reports that] employees of the Jide Village Cooperative participate in agricultural production in their spare time.

[This newspaper reports from] Taiyue, 17th: The Yangcheng Jide Village Cooperative has determined its cooperative policy for this year, which is mainly to serve agriculture, and has researched several methods: (1) Accurate calculations are made to reduce the number of cooperative employees and workers as much as possible to increase the labor force in agriculture. The pharmacy reduced one accountant, whose duties are now performed by the person dispensing medicine. The dyeing workshop reduced the accountant, with the dyer collecting payments instead. The coal kiln reduced one of the two odd-job workers, and the men learning to spin at the textile factory were reduced, to return to study when they are idle in winter. A total of four people were reduced in this way. (2) Organize workers and employees to participate in agricultural production in their spare time. Last year, the production of the families of cooperative employees and workers mainly relied on preferential treatment from mutual aid teams. The mutual aid teams first worked for military, martyr, and cadre families, and when it was the turn of cooperative cadres, it was often past the season, which made the cooperative cadres feel unmotivated. Now, a total of twenty-six workers and employees have been organized and divided into five groups according to their business location. The cooperative manager also serves as the mutual aid team leader, saving the labor of preferential treatment from the masses. For example, coal kiln workers used to go down the kiln early every day in winter, and in summer, they would only go down the kiln after their morning meal. Therefore, twelve coal kiln workers were organized into two groups to help each other carry manure at home every morning. Three people each morning could accomplish one day's work, and twelve people could accomplish four days' work. In addition to the workers at the pottery kiln, two employees and five odd-job workers were organized into a group to work every morning or afternoon, taking half a day to return home to carry manure. The work is done collectively, doing it for you today and for him tomorrow. The five families have a total of twenty-three mu of grain land, and in the spring plowing and manure hauling, sixty-nine workdays were saved. Now, they have also hauled small manure for eight mu of corn land. (3) The credit department provided loans to help farmers buy livestock, lending out a total of 65,000 yuan, and the farmers bought back three cows, two donkeys, and one mule. (4) Organize a small iron furnace to adjust farm tools. Farm tools worth 31,000 yuan have been loaned to twenty-one households. (5) Purchase 500 jin of cotton seeds to solve the cotton seed shortage and promote cotton planting.

　　吉德村合作社职工
    业余参加农业生产
    【本报太岳十七日电】阳城吉德村合作社确定今年合作方针，主要为农业服务，并研究出几个办法：（一）精确计算，尽量减缩合作社职员工人，以增加农业上的劳动力。药铺减去一个会计，由拿药的人兼职。染坊减去会计，由染匠代要账。煤窑上两个打杂的减去一个，纺织工厂学纺的男人减去，冬天闲了再来学习。这样共减去四人。（二）组织工人职员业余参加农业生产。去年合作社职员工人家庭的生产，主要靠互助组优待。互助组先给军、烈、干属做活，轮到合作社干部名下，往往都过了季节，使合作社干部情绪不高。现在共组织职员工人二十六人，按业务所在地分成五个组。合作社经理兼互助分队长，节省了群众的优待劳力，如煤窑工人冬天是每天要早下窑，夏天是吃了前晌饭才下窑，因此就把煤窑工人组织了十二人，分两组每天早上在家里互助担粪，每早三个人能顶一天工，十二个人顶四个工，缸窑上除工人外，把两个职员与五个杂务人员组织一组，每天午前或午后做工，抽出半天工夫回家担粪，做活是集体做，今天给你做，明天给他做。五家共二十三亩谷地，在春耕担粪中，省了六十九个工。现在又担了八亩玉茭地的小粪。（三）信用部贷款扶助农民伙买牲口，共贷出六万五千元，农民买回三头牛，两头驴，一头骡。（四）组织一个小铁炉，调剂农具。已贷给二十一户价值三万一千元的农具。（五）购买棉籽五百斤，解决棉籽困难，推广植棉。
