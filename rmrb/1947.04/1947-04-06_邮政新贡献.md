　　New Contributions of the Post Office
    Under the call of "Everything for the War, Vigorously Support the Front," the Taihang Postal Administration has adjusted trunk lines, strengthened its forces, and increased postal delivery speed. It has decided to add night shifts on trunk lines starting from the 3rd. This is a major event in the postal construction of our region. Comrades from various bureaus and stations are in high spirits, vying for the opportunity to work the night shift, which is commendable.
    Our region's postal construction has achieved remarkable results, especially in the past year of the self-defense war. Military postal services have been established successively at the front lines of Ji-Lu-Yu, Taiyue, and Northern Henan, which has won unanimous praise from the military and civilians in the front and rear. This adjustment of trunk lines and implementation of night shifts in Taihang is a major development in postal construction. In the beginning, there will inevitably be some difficulties. It is hoped that postal workers in various places will work hard to overcome them. It is also hoped that villages along the routes of night shift postal workers, local government organs, especially the armed committees and militia comrades, will pay close attention to protecting their safety to prevent sabotage by special agents.

　　邮政新贡献
    太行邮政管理局在一切为了战争大力支援前线的号召下，调整干线，加强力量，提高邮递速度，决定于三日起在干线上增设了夜班。这是我区邮政建设中的一件大事，各局站邮工同志情绪高涨，互相争取夜班出发，值得予以表扬。
    我区邮政建设曾具显著成绩，尤其在一年来之自卫战争中，在冀鲁豫、太岳、豫北前线先后建立军邮，曾博得前后方军民一致好评。此次太行调整干线，实行夜班，更是邮政建设的一大发展，开始难免会遇到一些困难，希各地邮工同志努力克服，并望夜班邮工所经沿途村庄、地方政权机关，特别是武委会民兵同志，切实注意保护他们的安全，以防特务破坏。
