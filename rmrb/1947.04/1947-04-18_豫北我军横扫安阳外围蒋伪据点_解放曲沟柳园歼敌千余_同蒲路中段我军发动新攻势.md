　　Our Army in Northern Henan Sweeps Away Chiang Kai-shek-Puppet Strongholds Around Anyang
    Liberates Qugou and Liuyuan, Annihilating Over a Thousand Enemies
    Our Army Launches New Offensive in the Central Section of the Tongpu Railway
    [Report from the Northern Henan Front, April 16th] The People's Liberation Army in Northern Henan annihilated over a thousand more enemies and captured strongholds such as Qugou and Nanbeiliusi west of Anyang, and Liuyuan east of Anyang. After one unit of the Liberation Army recovered important strongholds such as Liuhegou, Shuizhi, Lunzhang, and Lushan, they captured Qugou and Nanbeiliusi west of Anyang on the evening of the 13th, annihilating the Liu Lexian unit of the First Regiment of the Chiang Kai-shek Henan Third Special Commissioner's Office Security, as well as the Anyang County Security Regiment and all Chiang Kai-shek's "Returning Home" corps west of Anyang. They killed over 200 enemies, captured over 1,000, and seized two mortars, over 30 machine guns, over 700 rifles and short guns, and 30,000 rounds of ammunition. On the same night, the Liberation Army east of Anyang recovered the Liuyuan stronghold, annihilating two companies of the Guo Qing unit of the Third Regiment of the Chiang Kai-shek-puppet Third Special Commissioner's Office "People's Self-Defense."
    [Report from the Tongpu Front, April 16th] A unit of the Taiyue People's Liberation Army marched north, launching an offensive in the Pingyao-Jiexiu area at 2:30 on the 10th. By dawn on the 11th, they had captured the important strongholds of Dongguo and Jinzhuang (ten li east of Pingyao), killing or wounding 146 enemies, including Cao Chao, the deputy head of the "Struggle Corps," and capturing 189 enemies. They seized ten machine guns, fifteen small cannons, two submachine guns, and ninety-five rifles and short guns. Our army is now approaching the suburbs of Pingyao, and the Yan Xishan puppet forces inside the city are closing all four gates, panicking.
    [Report from the Tongpu Front, April 13th] Zhang Hongde, the head of the enemy's Fifth Security Regiment, and Fan Huihuang, the deputy head, who escaped from Yicheng in disguise, were captured by Shen Qingxi and other militia heroes of Yicheng; Li Mengyuan, the head of the puppet Public Security Bureau of the county, was killed by the militia. When the Yicheng battle began, Shen Qingxi led over a thousand militiamen, relying on their familiarity with the terrain and thorough situation investigation, and divided them into more than ten small groups to guard the key intersections, especially tightly blockading the main roads to Jiangxian and Quwo. On the night of the 5th, after the troops captured the Taishan Temple, Zhang Hongde and Fan Huihuang broke through the south gate with more than 40 of their men and fled to the Xiayang River, where they were met head-on by Shen Qingxi and others. Zhang and others scattered and hid in the earthen kilns in the Xiayang River ditch. Shen immediately led the crowd to pursue and search, and cooperated with loudspeaker appeals. In one day, they searched out Zhang Hongde, Fan Huihuang, and 48 others in five earthen kilns. They seized three machine guns, twenty-three rifles, and five million Chiang Kai-shek currency. Zhang Hongde had previously escaped in disguise during our two recoveries of Yicheng, but this time he fell into the militia's inescapable net. Li Mengyuan, the head of the Yicheng Public Security Bureau, led a unit to break through the north gate that night and was shot and killed on the spot by the militia between Shoucheng and Fengbi, along with another fifteen killed or captured.
