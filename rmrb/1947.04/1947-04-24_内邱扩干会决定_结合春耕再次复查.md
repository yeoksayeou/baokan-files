    Neiqiu Expanded Cadre Meeting Decides
    to Combine Spring Plowing with Another Review

    [This newspaper Neiqiu news] After Neiqiu universally trained liberated peasants throughout the county, an expanded meeting of county and district cadres was held at the beginning of the month. They reported and studied the movement situation in the county over the past month and decided to combine the current spring plowing with another review, resolutely compensate the interests of the middle peasants, conduct education on the path to prosperity, continue to mobilize the backward, and adjust the relationship between cadres and the masses, to pave the way for this year's great production movement. From the reports, it can be seen that: (1) In the year and a half of the movement, the slogan of uniting with the middle peasants still aroused suspicion among the middle peasants, forming the "knotty household" (圪塔户) mentality of the middle peasants, which also affected the enthusiasm of the poor peasants and hired laborers for getting rich. For example, six households in Shenjiadong discussed preparing to eat from the "big pot," putting their property together. Under the widespread growth of this "knotty household" mentality, peasants do not value the land and are afraid of burdens, creating ideological obstacles to carrying out the production movement. (2) After the universal training, it was found that the movement throughout the county was not balanced, and there were still individual backward villages where the landlords were not overthrown, and there were still many "backward" masses in general villages. For example, the militia of Qianluting in the Second District still hid things for the landlords. (3) Although some areas resolved the relationship between cadres and the masses in some villages after the universal training, the phenomenon of disharmony between cadres and the masses still existed in most villages. (4) Spring plowing has arrived, and cadres and the masses are universally demanding production, but the combination with production in the past was poor. Some villages have not even transported manure to the fields. After five days of research and discussion, the county committee finally summarized: (1) To solve the "knotty household" mentality, it is necessary to appropriately compensate the losses of the middle peasants. Educate cadres to return the excess gains, mobilize the backward to squeeze out feudal vestiges, and call on the masses to use the spirit of unity and friendship to solve this problem. (2) To solve the relationship between cadres and the masses and implement the mobilization of the "backward," it should be clearly stated that resolving the relationship between cadres and the masses should not harm the emotions of the cadres, but also appropriately open up democracy. According to the experience of Beizhang Town and Motianling Village, the cadres and the masses should be separated, allowing the masses to complain and make suggestions, and then guiding them to recognize that the cadres still have achievements and contributions. After recognizing the contributions, the masses are asked to make self-criticisms as well. On the cadre side, they should first be allowed to state their merits and then review their mistakes. After both sides make self-criticisms, a unity meeting should be held to solve the problems. We cannot only look at the shortcomings and not the advantages. At the same time, we must also examine our leadership, so that not a single backward mass is left behind, and not a single feudal vestige remains. (3) Carry out review and compensation work to solve the ideological obstacles to production. During the spring plowing season, we must seize the time and make a concentrated effort on spring plowing. We must clarify the characteristics of this year's war participation tasks and labor difficulties, and we should carry forward the past experience of combining labor and military affairs and land reform, seize the time, make a concentrated effort on spring plowing, prepare to participate in the war, and thoroughly liberate ourselves.

    内邱扩干会决定
    结合春耕再次复查
    【本报内邱讯】内邱普训全县翻身农民后，于月初召开县区干部扩大会议。汇报与研究了一个月来全县运动情况，确定结合目前春耕，开展再次复查，坚决补偿中农利益，进行发家前途教育，继续贯彻发动落后，调整干群关系，为今年的大生产运动铺平道路。从汇报中，看出：（一）一年半的运动中团结中农口号，在中农中仍有怀疑，形成中农的圪塔户思想，同时也影响了贫雇的发家情绪。如申家洞有六户商量准备吃“大锅饭”，将财产和起来。在这种圪塔户思想普遍的滋长下，农民不重视土地，怕负担、造成开展生产运动的思想障碍。（二）经过普训，发现全县运动不够平衡，还有个别落后村，地主没斗垮，一般村中还有不少的“落后”群众。如二区前鲁亭民兵还掩护地主藏东西。（三）在普训后，虽然部分地区解决了一些村庄的干群关系，大部分村庄仍存着干群不调和现象。（四）春耕已到，由干部到群众普遍要求生产，过去对生产结合较差，有些村连粪还没有运到地里。经过五天的研究讨论，最后县委作了总结：（一）解决圪塔户思想必须适当补偿中农损失。教育干部退出多得果实，发动落后挤封建尾巴，号召群众以团结友爱的精神，来解决这一问题。（二）解决干群关系，贯彻发动“落后”，应明确解决干群关系，不要伤害了干部情绪，又要适当开放民主。根据北障镇、摩天岭村的经验，使干群分开，让群众来发牢骚，提意见，然后诱导认识干部还有成绩是有功劳的，认识功劳以后，叫群众也作检讨，在干部方面先让其表功，再检讨错误。双方作检讨以后，召开团结大会解决问题。不能只看缺点不看优点，同时也要检查咱们的领导，做到不留一个落后群众，不剩一个封建尾巴。（三）进行查补工作，解决生产思想障碍。在春耕时期更要抓紧时间，突击春耕，要明确今年参战任务与劳力困难的特点，应发扬过去劳武结合及土地改革的经验，抓紧时间，突击春耕，准备参战并要翻透身。（子琦）
