Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 25th -- In the anti-"mopping-up" struggle, the people of Haimen are carrying out spring planting. The Hainan District Team is launching widespread attacks to cover the people's spring planting. A certain township's small guerrilla unit also advanced near strongholds, repelling Chiang Kai-shek's puppet troops twice with machine-gun fire against the masses, so that the fields at the foot of the bunkers have also been cultivated. The masses have launched a movement to cultivate land on behalf of the families of soldiers and martyrs. In a certain township, 1,044 people participated in the land cultivation in five days, including many teachers, students, women, and children. This production struggle is continuing to unfold.
