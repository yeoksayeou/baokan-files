　　Land Reform in the Eight Districts of Wu'an
　　Generally Moving Towards Balance
　　[Report from this newspaper] After a month of efforts in the thorough land investigation and general liquidation movement in the eight districts of Wu'an, the 40 villages in the entire district have largely achieved balance. The total land recovered through this investigation and accounting amounts to 10,900 mu, 2,400 rooms, 8,200 red contracts, over 90,000 jin of grain, and over 20,000 other items. Over 10,000 men and women newly joined the struggle, accounting for approximately one-third of the district's population. Among them, over 2,000 activists emerged, and two "counter-revolutionary" account books of landlords were uncovered. Over one hundred peasant households have handed over items hidden for landlords. The main characteristics of this movement are: mobilizing honest peasants, relying on poor and hired peasants as the main force, and uniting with middle peasants. Therefore, the scale remains very large and powerful. For example, in Nanzhuang, over 400 women newly joined the struggle. In Chongyi, a first-class village, over 200 people complained to the landlords for the first time. It is believed that in villages that earnestly mobilized honest peasants, broke through personal relationships, and resolutely separated from landlords, the movement was particularly thorough. Conversely, in villages that did not pay attention to mobilizing honest peasants, even if a few cadres and activists worked very hard and appeared outwardly to be vigorous, they still could not thoroughly eliminate hidden landlords. For example, in Shangquan Village, the cadres and masses shouted slogans and struggled with great energy in form, but in essence, the cadres still dared not boldly let go and mobilize honest peasants. Therefore, to this day, two landlord households are still hidden within the peasant association.
　　Currently, most villages are distributing the fruits of the struggle. The district committee has issued a special call: to completely fill in the "gulleys" in this distribution and achieve a general average. In this stage, 71 cadres have returned over 100 mu of land, 28 rooms, and 23 livestock. However, continued efforts are still needed in this area. The entire district is still continuing to thoroughly investigate feudal remnants. (Tian Lin)

　　武安八区查田
    大体走向平衡
    【本报讯】武安八区的彻底查田总清算运动，经一月来的努力，全区四十个村，已大体平衡。总计此次清查、算账，收回土地一万零九百亩，房子二千四百间，红文书八千二百张，粮食九万多斤，其他用物二万多件。新参加斗争的男女一万多人，约占全区人口三分之一，其中涌现出二千多积极分子，并查出地主“变天”账两本，一百余户农民献出给地主隐藏的东西。此次运动主要特点是：发动老实农民，以贫雇为主力，团结中农，因而规模仍然十分宏大有力，如南庄新参加斗争的妇女就有四百多个。一等村的崇义，这次也有二百多人第一次向地主诉苦。认为已经彻底的店头村，这次从包庇户及地主家中，搜出包袱二百五十个，清出假买地八十二亩，假当地二十七亩，经验证明：那个村认真的发动了老实农民，打破情面，和地主坚决分家，运动就特别彻底。反之那个村不注意发动老实农民，即使几个干部、积极分子干的很起劲，从表面上看确是轰轰烈烈，而实际上仍达不到彻底消灭隐蔽地主之目的。如上泉村，形式上干部群众喊口号斗争，特别劲大，而实质上干部仍不敢大胆放手，发动老实农民，故至今还有两户地主隐蔽在农会。
    目前各村大部正分果实，区分委特别号召：要在此次分配中，彻底填平“圪道”，做到大体平均。这一阶段已有七十一个干部退出一百多亩土地、房子二十八间、牲口二十三头；但仍需在这方面做继续的努力。目前全区仍在继续深入追查封建中。（天林）
