    Teachers and Students of All Schools in Jincheng
    Participate in Spring Ploughing and Production
    [This Newspaper Reports] Jincheng, under the general principle of everything revolving around and being integrated with the central task, the entire county's teachers and students have been drawn into a large-scale production movement, organizing mutual aid, exchanging labor for preferential treatment for resistance against Japan, and conducting education through production. For example, teachers and students of the Third High School organized eight mutual aid groups, using their spare time after class to engage in production. In ten days, they delivered manure to sixteen mu of land, averaging thirty-five dan per mu, and also built slopes, repaired embankments, and used plows to quickly prepare the land. The Bajie Public Primary School transformed the Yuanxiao Festival "Nao Honghuo" (making a hubbub) group into two mutual aid groups, which have now grown from fifteen to twenty-five people. In one month, they tidied up one hundred and thirteen mu of land, not counting odd jobs. Teachers and students of the Third High School carried twenty-seven dan of manure for military dependents, hoed five mu of stubble, and tidied up twelve mu of land. In addition to this, they also plan to solve the problem of single-layer clothing for students through production. For example, students in Lizhai earned 12,000 yuan last year through production, and each made a military cap. This year, everyone is happily saying, "Last year, production brought us new caps, this year, production will bring us uniforms." This spring, Bajie Public Primary School also burned alkali ash and boiled five pots of saltpeter, earning a profit of 6,800 yuan, or one shi and nine dou of rice. Now, in order to support the front lines and solve the labor shortage, students plan to work for others for hire, earning money to solve the problem of summer single-layer clothing.

    晋城各校师生
    一齐春耕生产
    【本报讯】晋城在一切围绕与结合中心工作总的原则下，全县教师学生一齐卷入了大规模生产运动组织互助，变工优抗，生产中进行教育。如三高师生组织了八个互助组，利用下午课余时间，进行生产，十天已送了十六亩地粪，每亩平均三十五担，并垒坡修堰用抢犁抢好。巴公小学把元宵节闹哄火的故事组，变成两个互助组，现已由十五人发展到二十五人，一个月收拾了一百一十三亩地，零活还不算。三高师生给军属担粪二十七担，＠茬五亩，收拾地十二亩，除此以外，他们还计划靠生产解决学生的单衣问题。如：李寨学生去年生产赚洋一万二千元，每人做了一顶军帽；今年大家都高兴着说：“去年生产戴新帽，今年生产穿制服。”巴公小学今春捎带烧硝灰熬硝五锅，赚利六千八百元，一石九斗米。现在学生为了支援前线，解决缺乏劳力困难，计划应雇给人做活，赚钱解决夏天单衣问题。（晋城劳动人民小报）
