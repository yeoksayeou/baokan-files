　　Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 16th: (Delayed) The First Division of the US Marine Corps stationed in Tanggu has recently been airlifting large quantities of military supplies to aid Chiang Kai-shek's civil war, storing them at Xinhe Airport, twelve miles west of Tanggu. At the beginning of this month, they handed over a portion of these military supplies to the 452nd Regiment of the 151st Brigade of the 62nd Division of the Chiang army, which was passing through Tanggu en route to Tangshan, for use in attacking the eastern Hebei liberated area. In order to effectively defend themselves, a part of the Jidong guerrillas and militia attacked Xinhe Airport on the night of the 4th at 12:00 midnight, burning all four major civil war armories inside the airport. They safely withdrew on the morning of the 5th.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 16th: Jidong Branch reported the course of the Xinhe incident, stating: Xinhe Airport was built with the help of the US military in January of last year. After completion, it was garrisoned by the US military. It is located southeast of Tanggu wharf and has frequent airplane communication. Warehouses were built within the airport to store US-aided Chiang Kai-shek civil war military supplies. Chiang Kai-shek's military vehicles transferred from Tianjin to eastern Hebei or the Northeast to attack the liberated areas all made long stops here to replenish their equipment. At the beginning of April, the 151st Brigade of the 62nd Division of the Chiang army was transferred from Tianjin to Tangshan to attack the Jidong liberated area, where they replenished their full equipment. As of the 4th of this month, another four regiments of the Chiang army gathered in Tangshan, attempting to be transferred to the Northeast to participate in the civil war, were also supplied from here. The airport and the huge warehouses inside were heavily guarded by the US military. Strong fortifications and electric fences were built outside the airport, with US Marine Corps armored vehicles and tanks constantly patrolling, and had illegally invaded the liberated area. In order to effectively defend themselves and destroy this civil war military supply, a part of the Jidong guerrillas and militia attacked the airport on the night of the 4th at 12:00 midnight, destroying all four major civil war armories. When the guerrillas attacked the airport warehouses, the US military opened fire on the guerrillas. The guerrillas resolutely defended themselves and returned fire. At 0:40 AM, US troops from Tanggu also dispatched fourteen armored vehicles and several tanks to attack the guerrillas. The guerrillas destroyed six of their armored vehicles and then withdrew from the battle.

　　冀东我军攻入新河机场
    焚毁美助蒋内战军火库
    【新华社晋察冀十六日电】（迟到）驻塘沽美海军陆战队第一师，近空运大批军火助蒋内战，藏于塘沽西十二里之新河飞机场，并于本月初将该项军火一部，交与途经塘沽调到唐山之蒋军整六十二师一五一旅四五二团，作为进攻热东解放区之用。为有效自卫，冀东游击队及民兵一部，乃于四日夜十二时，一举袭入新河飞机场，将场内蒋军之四大内战军火仓库全部焚毁。五日晨即安然撤出。
    【新华社晋察冀十六日电】冀东分社报导新河事件经过称：新河机场系在美军帮助下建筑于去年一月，完成后为美军驻守，东南临塘沽码头，有飞机经常联络。场内筑有仓库贮藏美助蒋内战军火。由天津调往冀东或东北进攻解放区之蒋军兵车，到此均作长时停留，以补充装备。四月初蒋军整六十二师一五一旅由天津调到唐山进攻冀东解放区，即在此补充了全副装备。截至本月四日止，唐山集结的另四个团的蒋军，企图调往东北参加内战，亦由此补给。飞机场及场内庞大仓库均为美军严密守备，场外筑有强固工事及电网，有美陆战队装甲车及坦克不断巡逻，并曾非法侵入解放区。为有效自卫，炸毁此内战军火，冀东游击队及民兵一部，于四日夜十二时袭入场内，将四大内战军火仓库全部炸毁。当游击队向机场仓库袭击时，美军竟向游击队开枪攻击，该部游击队严正自卫，当予还击。零时四十分，塘沽美军亦出动装甲车十四辆及坦克数辆赶来向游击队攻击，该部游击队于击毁其六辆装甲车后，即撤出战斗。
