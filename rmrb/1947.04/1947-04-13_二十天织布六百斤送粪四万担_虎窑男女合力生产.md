　　Twenty Days of Weaving 600 Jin of Cloth, Delivering 40,000 Dan of Manure
    Tiger Kiln Men and Women Work Together for Production
    [Report from this newspaper] After the Tiger Kiln Village in the Sixth District of Pingshun held a mass meeting on the fifth day of the second lunar month, and put forward the slogan of "Get Rich and Prosper, You Have to Spin and Weave," the women became even more enthusiastic, spinning and weaving from dawn to dusk. Male cadres all went deep into the groups to lead and inspect. In twenty days, 120 weaving women wove a total of 650 jin of cloth, which was priced at 1,800 yuan per jin, totaling 1,170,000 yuan. Each weaving woman earned an average of 9,370 yuan.
    [Another Report] The mutual aid groups in Tiger Kiln Village have delivered all 46,950 dan of fertilizer from the entire village to the fields in twenty days. The men said that the women's weaving achievements are great, and they cannot fall behind the women. If men and women work together with one heart and one mind for production, achieving "Geng San Yu Yi" (耕三余一 - tilling three days and having one day to spare) this year will not be a problem.

　　二十天织布六百斤送粪四万担
    虎窑男女合力生产
    【本报讯】平顺六区虎窑村在阴历二月初五日召开全村群众大会，提出“发家致富，就得纺花织布”的口号后，妇女劲头更大，起早搭黑的纺织，男干部都深入到小组领导与检查。在二十天内一百二十个纺织妇，共织成六百五十斤布，每斤布一千八百元折价，共合洋一百一十七万元，每个纺织妇平均赚洋九千三百七十元。
    【又讯】虎窑村的互助组在二十天中，已把全村四万六千九百五十担肥全部送到田里去了。男人说妇女纺织成绩大，可不能落在妇女后面，咱男女齐心合力生产，今年的耕三余一不成问题。
