　　After dispelling various ideological concerns about daring to get rich, further discussions were held on how to get rich, clarifying the path to wealth. Everyone exchanged experiences on how to get rich. Zhao Gang from Tuling said: "I got rich by raising pigs." Labor Model Wang Zhanyuan said: "Last year, our village made 800,000 yuan in several transportation ventures. I received 15,000 yuan just from one donkey." Labor Hero Zhao Fuke said: "Textiles are the most profitable. A woman in our village challenged her husband in production. Her husband earned six shi of grain in a year, while she earned eight shi of grain in three months." Finally, one cadre said: "Our production should focus on agriculture, combined with sideline production. Only a comprehensive approach can lead to great wealth. Last year, we had a venture that required no capital but yielded immense profits. We gathered two loads of spindles from the mountains, carried them to Xingtai to exchange for forty jin of cotton. After two round trips, we bought two mules. Don't you see how great the profit is?" After many people introduced their experiences in getting rich, everyone understood that production should focus on agriculture, combined with sideline handicraft production throughout the year. Relying on the mountains for resources, relying on the water for resources, relying on the roads for resources, relying on the coal for resources – as long as you move, you can make money. After everyone found the way to get rich, they then discussed how to ensure wealth, and it was clarified that organizing is the inevitable path from poverty to wealth. Labor Hero Cheng Fuyuan from Longwang said: "If we want to get rich, we can't do it without organizing. In 1944, our village had only two donkeys and eight cows left, and about thirty households. After organizing, production improved, and supporting the war effort was not delayed, making us a model village in our county. Now the village raises more than 190 pigs, bought 19 donkeys, and six mules. The living standards of the whole village have improved." Wang Zhanyuan from Xinzhuang said: "Organizing can be as powerful as machines, and can take care of everything, leading from poverty to wealth. But it must be with everyone's conscious and voluntary participation, ensuring that no one suffers losses. The leader must also understand the people's concerns and solve difficulties in a timely manner in order to consolidate the organization." Gong Xiaobao from Dongguan said: "No wonder our mutual aid last year didn't profit. Everyone was pulling in a different direction. So, mutual aid must be voluntary, and concerns must be understood and problems solved. We were a group forced together. People in the group didn't get along and no one managed it. Now I know how to organize. I must catch up with you when I go back this year."

　　During the six days of discussion, everyone resolved a series of ideological obstacles on the road to production, found the way to ensure wealth, and aroused the enthusiasm to build a family fortune. In small groups, they discussed how to implement the plans, and everyone helped each other to make production plans based on the actual situation in the villages, striving to make the best use of everyone's talents and resources, and to ensure that every village achieved a surplus of one-third after meeting their needs.

　　Finally, the leadership, easily and happily, based on the plans of each group, put forward the ten standards of this year's county-wide production plan as a whole, calling on every cadre to mobilize and organize the masses to strive to complete the plan.

　　交流发财经验
    当不敢发财的多种多样思想顾虑打消后，进一步讨论怎样发财致富，明确发财之道，大家交流起发财经验来。土岭赵刚说：我喂猪发了财。劳动状元王占元说：我村去年搞运输几回赚洋八十万，我一个毛驴就分到一万五千元。劳英赵富科说：纺织得利最大，俺村一个妇女与她男人挑战生产，她男人劳动一年收了六石粮，人家三个月就赚了八石粮。最后一个干部说：咱的生产，应该以农业为主，结合副业生产，全面搞才能发大财。俺去年闹了一回生产是没本万利，到山上割了两担锭，担到邢台换了四十斤花，倒翻了两回，就买成两个骡子，你们看这利大不大。经过许多人介绍发财经验后，大家明确了，在生产上应以农业为主，结合副业手工业生产，贯彻全年，靠山吃山，靠水吃水，傍道吃道，傍煤吃煤，只要动弹，就能赚钱。大家找见发财门径后，接着提出如何保证发财，展开讨论，明确组织起来是由穷变富的必经之路。龙旺劳英程福元说：咱们要发财，非组织起来不能干，四四年俺村只剩下二头毛驴八头牛，有卅来户人家，组织起来后生产搞的好，支差参战都不误，成了咱县模范村。村里现在喂的一百九十多口猪，买进十九头驴，六个骡子，全村生活都改善了。新庄王占元说：组织起来，就能顶机器，能面面俱到，由穷变富。但必须大家都自觉自愿，保证互不吃亏，当头的还得会摸群众心思及时解决困难，才能巩固。东关宫小保说：怪不得俺去年互助就没得利，一人一股劲，原来搞互助还得自愿、摸心思解决问题，俺是编起来的组，组里人合不来也没人管，这俺可知道怎样组织起来了，今年回去也得赶上你们哩。
    六天讨论中，大家解决了一连串生产道路上的思想障碍，找得了保证发财致富的道路后，鼓起发家劲头，在小组中酝酿如何实行，大家便依据村里的实际情况，相互帮助订起生产计划来，要做到人尽其才、材尽其用，村村达到耕三余一。
    最后领导上轻松愉快的依据各小组的计划，总的提出今年的全县生产计划的十大标准，号召每个干部动员组织群众，为完成计划而努力。
