　　[This article reports on] Many War Effort Models Emerge in the Taiyue Region's Medical and Health Circles
　　[This dispatch from our newspaper in] Taiyue, dated the 5th: In the past eight months of the patriotic self-defense war, many models of supporting the front lines have emerged from the medical and health circles in various parts of the Taiyue region, and various organizational forms have been created to adapt to the needs of the war and the masses. When Dr. Li Kerang from Anze participated in the war in October last year, considering that there were many patients among the masses, which had a great impact, he immediately organized doctors from the 3rd and 7th districts of the county and six cooperatives to set up six service stations along the way, specializing in treating the masses supporting the front lines. Later, because the service stations could not fully adapt to the needs of the war, they were reorganized into mobile medical teams. Twelve doctors were divided into four groups to directly follow the masses to the front lines for treatment, which had a great effect. In half a month, more than 170 people were cured. Except for a few seriously ill patients, 90% of the masses were guaranteed to successfully complete their tasks. In addition, fourteen doctors were organized in the rear to specialize in treating patients at home, ensuring that the masses in the rear continue to surge to the front lines. Mr. Zhang Ziming from Jicheng not only participated in the war himself during the several battles to liberate Jicheng last year, but also organized sixteen doctors and four nurses to form a service team to serve on the front lines. During the second liberation of Jicheng, his service team treated 57 wounded soldiers. Ma Qiushui from Yangcheng brought first-aid pills to the front lines to rescue wounded masses participating in the war last year, completely disregarding his own life. Zhang Yougui from Fushan kept a sick soldier from the army at his home for a month last year. After he recovered, he sent the comrade back to his original unit, without asking for any medical or food expenses. Zhang Qinglin from Xiaxian treated thirteen soldiers of a certain regiment, fifteen local cadres and masses, and more than thirty captured Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan soldiers while Xiaxian was occupied by the enemy. He also donated his own medicines worth more than 30,000 yuan to the masses, which was deeply supported by the army and the people. Secondly, there are also many models in cultivating and training health personnel. Such as Guanghua Hospital; Gaoping Minxu Hospital; and the Yangcheng Sixth District United Cooperative Medical Department have made great achievements. The Minxu Hospital trained more than 60 health personnel last year and served the army three times. The Yangcheng Sixth District United Cooperative also trained more than 40 people, preparing to support the front lines for a long time.

　　太岳区医药卫生界涌现不少参战模范
    【本报太岳五日电】在过去八个月爱国自卫战争中，太岳各地医药卫生界涌现出不少支援前线的模范，并创造出各种适应战争和群众需要的组织形式。安泽医生李克让在去年十月参战时，鉴于群众病人很多，影响很大，他马上组织本县三、七区医生和六个合作社，在沿途设立了六个服务站，专为支援前线群众治疗。后因服务站不能完全适应战争需要，即改组成巡回医疗队。十二个医生分成四组，直接随群众到火线治疗，效果很大。半月中，治好一百七十余人，除少数重病号外，保证百分之九十的群众胜利完成任务。另外在后方组织十四个医生，专治在家的病人，保证后方群众不断涌上前线。冀城张子明先生，在去年屡次解放冀城战役中，不但自己参战，并组织了十六个医生和四个看护员，组成服务团到前线服务，在第二次解放冀城时，他的服务团曾治好五十七个伤员。阳城马秋水去年参战自带急救丸到火线抢救受伤的参战群众，完全不顾自己性命危险。浮山张有贵去年曾把军队一个病号留到他家住了一月之久，待病好后才把该同志送回原部队，医药膳费分文不要。夏县张青麟，在敌占夏县时，医治我某团战士十三人，地方干部及群众十五人，被俘蒋阎军三十余人，并将自己价值三万余元的药品赠送给群众，深得军民拥护。其次在培养训练卫生人材方面的模范亦很多。如广华医院；高平民需医院；阳城六区联社医药部都有很大成绩。民需医院去年曾训练卫生人材六十余人，随军服务三次。阳城六辔区联社也训练出四十余人，准备长期支援前线。
