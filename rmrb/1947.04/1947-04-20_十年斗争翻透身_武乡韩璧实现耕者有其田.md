Ten Years of Struggle to Turn Things Over
Wu Xiang Han Bi Realizes "Land to the Tiller"
Wei Xiaoquan

Han Bi is a large village east of Wu Xiang city, the famous "Eight Great Families," the Wei Xiao Shan family, were the rulers of the village. Land was quite concentrated. Work in the village started relatively early since the War of Resistance, and it can represent the advanced villages of Wu Xiang. The village is also a model production village in the whole county. From this village, we can see the historical process of land reform in the old liberated areas, and also how the peasants, after obtaining land, launched a large-scale production movement and embarked on the road to prosperity.

(I) Land ownership among various classes before the war, class relations, and the characteristics of landlords' economic and political exploitation and oppression of peasants.

Land in Han Bi was quite concentrated, landlords exploited the peasants with high rents and high interest, and politically completely dominated the peasants. As the masses said, "If the Eighth Route Army had come two years later, the common people would not have been able to survive."

	Land Ownership Composition of Each Class Before the War
	Class	Households	Population	Land (Mu)	Self-Cultivated Land (Mu)	Per Capita Land (Mu)	Livestock
	Landlords	4	22	1457	712	65.9	9
	Rich Peasants (engaging in business)	2	16	62.6	134	7.64	2
	Rich Peasants	24	95	453.17	492.27	4.86	16.5
	Middle Peasants	93	255	753.4	1078.5	2.95	221
	Poor Peasants	36	325	742.2	753	1.36	12.5
	Shepherds and Laborers	10	15	5.2	5.2	.35
	Extremely Poor	14	48	13.2	 	.27
	Total	207	776	3501.77	3156.97	84.33	271

From this table, it can be seen that the land in this village was very concentrated. Landlords and rich peasants accounted for 14.4% of the total households and 17.13% of the total population, but occupied 61.6% of the land; middle, poor, hired, and extremely poor peasants accounted for 84.91% of the total households and 82.64% of the population, but only occupied 39.4% of the land. Why was this the case? It can be understood from the following situations of the landlords' wealth accumulation and exploitation of the peasants:

Among the four landlord households in the village, the largest was Wei Xiao Shan of the "Eight Great Families." The four households owned a total of 2103 mu of land, of which Wei Xiao Shan alone occupied 1419.6 mu. According to legend, the terrain of Han Bi is "Phoenix Spreads Its Wings," with Wei Xiao Shan in the South Village as the head, Wei Wen Lan in the East Village as the fat under the armpits, Wei Er Gou in the North Courtyard as the chest, and the poor people in the whole village as the phoenix's feathers; it is also known as "Golden Thread Hanging Calabash," with the South Village as a calabash, and the small path from the village to the South Village as the golden thread. There are more than thirty brick-built fortified courtyards inside the calabash. These two anecdotes were used to deceive the peasants, saying that the landlords' wealth was due to living in an auspicious place, and the poor were born with poor fate. However, this myth of deceiving the peasants has been thoroughly exposed by the awakened peasants. It is clear from the landlords' wealth accumulation and exploitation of the peasants:

"Golden Thread Hanging Calabash," sucking the blood and sweat of the poor: According to an 88-year-old man, the Wei family was a wealthy family in the Ming Dynasty, and at that time they had 42 pawnshops. During the famine in the third year of Guangxu (1877), a large number of working people starved to death. The landlords had land but could not collect rent, so the Wei family was in a state of decline. Since the Republic of China, the Wei family produced officials in the Republican government. In addition, the burdens on the people increased due to the wars between Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan, and the countryside rapidly moved towards bankruptcy. The Wei family then concentrated a large amount of land, and the dilapidated Wei family recovered again. Its exploitation of the peasants was all-encompassing.

1.  High rent devours people: The four landlord households had 2103 mu of land, of which 1391 mu was leased out, accounting for 66.1% of the landlords' land. The rent rate was 50%, with each mu yielding three large斗 of fine grain (the斗 in this village is larger than one升 outside the village but smaller than two升 outside the village). 24 tenant households in the village were exploited. Wei Xiao Shan alone collected 336 shi of rent rice annually.

2.  High-interest exploitation: The four landlord households lent out 102,000 yuan, and the nine rich peasant households lent out 4,500 yuan at high interest. The South Village alone lent out 70,000 yuan, with 52 debtor households, as far as 50 miles away. In this village, records show that 18,683 yuan was lent out, with a monthly interest rate of 2.5%, which could earn 5,604 yuan a year, enough to buy 131 shi of rice. Over ten years, the accumulated interest would be 56,040 yuan in silver, which is 1,300 shi, the blood and sweat of the peasants sucked into the landlords' calabash. Among the 207 households in the village, 162 households borrowed money, accounting for 78.2% of the total households. Among the 162 households, 24 households lost their land due to borrowing money: 5 rich peasant households, lost 45 mu of land; 15 middle peasant households, lost 145 mu of land; 4 poor peasant households, lost 51 mu of land; totaling 241 mu of land lost. Yang Xing Tian's mother was forced to carry coal to pay interest even before the baby was one month old, Hei Xiao, Bang Jing and other three households went bankrupt because they could not pay the interest.

3.  Commercial combined with usury: According to a survey in the 24th year of the Republic of China (1935), the commercial income of the South Village alone was 8,000 yuan per year, accounting for 55% of its total income. The most harmful were the medicine shops and the official salt shops, which no one could escape. Because you can't help but take medicine when you are sick, and you can't help but eat salt, once you are hooked, it is difficult to escape.

4.  Exploitation through hiring was also very severe: According to statistics in the 24th year of the Republic of China (1935), the South Village alone employed 38 people, with an annual wage of 528 yuan. Among them, 12 shepherds earned an annual wage of 21.6 yuan each, and another 5 shepherds earned an annual wage of 24 yuan each. Six maids earned 5 yuan each per year. Three cooks, three handymen, two gatekeepers, one miller, one caretaker, three rent collectors, and two bookkeepers earned 5 to 10 yuan each per year. They treated the workers like cattle and horses. After serving the landlord for ten years, the maid San'e was sold by the landlord for 300 yuan in silver, or 600 yuan in paper money.

5.  Illegal plunder and extra-economic exploitation: Every time during weeding, summer harvest, and autumn harvest, all the peasants in the village had to work for the landlords for three or four days for free. All households who borrowed money or rented land had to put down their household chores and work for the landlords as soon as they heard the landlords ask. This has become a common practice. In the 19th year of the Republic of China (1930), when Jin banknotes collapsed, the landlord Wei Wen Lan used Jin banknotes to redeem 300 mu of land. As soon as he handed the money to the peasants, a notice was issued that the Jin banknotes were abolished. The peasants will never forget this kind of deception.

Landlords not only exploited the peasants economically, but also completely dominated them politically. Because the landlords had many officials in the Republican government, anyone who became an official had to greet them. The peasants in this village were oppressed and could not breathe. As soon as they saw the landlord, everyone in the South Village and the lower village stood up and greeted him. Wei Wen Lan was even more arrogant and bullied others. Seventy-two women in the village were raped and humiliated by him. He rode a horse and stepped on the shoulders of the groom. The hired worker Li Xiao Cheng was severely beaten for returning late from the market. Shi Cheng Qian and Wei Pei Liang were business landlords and served as village chiefs twice. They embezzled grain from the granary, forced Wang Dong Hua's sister to death, and forced the widow not to leave the Shi family's house. Wei Pei Liang led the enemy to harm Li Xian Guo's husband. In short, there were too many instances of landlords oppressing the masses.

(II) Land Changes During the War of Resistance Against Japan

A. 1937-1941: Anti-corruption, seizing political power, distributing "enlightened" land, and initially organizing the masses.

In the winter of 1937, the Fifth Regiment came to Han Bi, organized self-defense forces, publicized and organized cloth bag teams, and carried out anti-corruption struggles. Wei Pei Liang returned 20 shi of embezzled grain, and the masses began to establish a peasant association. Lao Ying Wang Hai Cheng was the first chairman of the peasant association. However, the political power was still ruled by the village chief trained by Yan Xishan, and Wei Pei Liang did not give in at all.

In 1938, the masses elected miner Bai Jun Ru as the village chief. The landlord Wei Xiao Shan was certainly not convinced, and the gambling arrest and seal grabbing incident occurred. The landlord, under the pretext of arresting gamblers, tied up our village chief and snatched the official seal of the village office, and then lured two or three hundred people to petition the district, eating white flour. The peasants also organized one or twenty people to protect the village chief, carrying cornmeal dry rations, but finally Wei Xiao Shan was detained, and Bai Jun Ru remained the village chief. This victory was the first of its kind in Han Bi since the beginning of time. As old man Li Xiao Cheng said, "Seeing the dogs walking in the shade, the time of bad luck has come."

In 1939, the South Village contributed 500 shi of grain for hoarding. After hoarding the grain, the landlord began to rent out the 92 mu of land cultivated by his servants, and the rent interest began to stop at this time.

In 1940, the Wei family landlords retreated to Zhu Jia Shan, but still secretly carried out sabotage activities. After three "sweeps," the Kuomintang fabricated lies and opposed the Communist Party. A guerrilla team of ours lived in the South Village and disintegrated a platoon in five days, who deserted with their guns.

In 1941, we conducted the Workers, Peasants, Youth and Women's Grand Election. This time, the peasants elected their own leaders for the first time. The landlords were still dissatisfied, provoked internal disunity among the peasants, and used the henchman Wei Quan to accuse our peasant association chairman Han Guo Sheng of raping women. Wang Hai Cheng's family had guns, attempting to overthrow our political power branch secretary, but this attempt was again thwarted. After the "sweep" at the end of the year, due to war losses, the masses were pessimistic, and the landlords took the opportunity to spread rumors to confuse the people.

B. 1942: Rent reduction and debt clearing, initially mobilizing the masses.

In 1942, the rent reduction and debt clearing struggle began. Peasants who had suffered from high rents and high interest exploitation for a long time were all involved in the movement. Struggles were carried out against Wei Xiao Shan and Wei Wen Lan successively. The strategy at that time was "pay attention to eliminating traitors, seize land issues, mobilize the masses, win over Wei Wen Lan, and isolate Wei Xiao Shan." A plan was formulated and slogans were put forward. The basic spirit and content was "to protect the tenancy contract and require written documents." The slogan was "not returning the documents will harm future generations," "revenge for grievances, revenge for injustices." Cadres swore to the masses "not to leave without taking the documents," and cadres made self-criticism for their shortcomings, which strengthened the relationship between cadres and the masses, and concentrated efforts to fight against the stubborn. Wei Wen Lan graduated from middle school and had served as a section chief in the old government. In 1939, he voluntarily "enlightened" 100 mu of land. The masses mistakenly thought he was an "enlightened" element. During this struggle, he again expressed "enlightenment," admitted the error of extracting land with Jin banknotes in the 19th year of the Republic of China (1930), and did not cover up the rape of women. The masses kept shouting, "Support enlightened gentry"; another slogan was "enlightenment is not automatic, no enlightenment without struggle." A total of 3,800 yuan in books and silver were returned, with 300 yuan in interest, and 30 mu of land were returned. The land was rented for ten years. Wei Xiao Shan was very stubborn and only returned one document. The masses shouted "oppose stubborn elements waiting for the weather to change," "oppose having grain but not handing over grain." After forty days of struggle, eighty people dug out four cave dwellings and unearthed 160 shi of grain, 100 shi of which had rotted. The masses were even more angry. This time, 40,000 strings of money and 7,000 yuan in silver were returned, and the rent rice was reduced from 200 shi to 150 shi, with only 120 shi being handed over at an 80% discount. 355 mu of land was assigned to debtor households, and a total of 511 mu of land was assigned including the "enlightened" land, accounting for 15.61% of the village's total land and 42.51% of the landlords' land. According to statistics, 41 households obtained land, totaling 127 mu, of which 28 poor peasant households divided 93.1 mu, 12 middle peasant households divided 31.6 mu, and one hired worker household divided 2.4 mu.

In short, the scale of the movement in 1942 was quite large, and most of the peasants were involved in the movement, but there was a lack of ideological mobilization. Now the cadres review and think that at that time, the cadres took the lead and the masses followed. After this movement, 29 poor peasant households rose to become new middle peasants, 8 extremely poor households rose to become poor peasants, and 3 worker households rose to become poor peasants. The changes in land and population of each class are:

The land of landlords and rich peasants decreased, accounting for 14.38% of the total households and 19.97% of the population, and the land was reduced to 47.31%. Middle peasants increased greatly, accounting for 46.13% of the households, 49% of the population, and 38.21% of the land. Poor and extremely poor peasants accounted for 38.93% of the households, 30.2% of the population, and 13.93% of the land.

Through the movement, the masses were initially organized. At this time, there were 69 peasant association members, accounting for 9.7% of the population, of which 31 were poor peasants, 27 were middle peasants, and 9 were rich peasants. There were 55 trade union members, including 10 semi-workers, 14 miners, 4 handicraft workers, and 27 hired workers. There were 39 militiamen, accounting for 5.4% of the population, of which 18 were poor peasants, 17 were middle peasants, and 3 were rich peasants. There were 116 women's association members, accounting for 37.66% of the women, of which 43 were poor peasants, 46 were middle peasants, 21 were rich peasants, and 6 were landlords. There were 128 self-defense team members. In total, there were 404 organized people, accounting for 57.58% of the population. There were 20 party members, accounting for 2.89% of the population, 11 were poor peasants, 5 were middle peasants, 5 were rich peasants, and 3 of the main cadres were rich peasants.

C. 1943-1945: Anti-spy confiscation of property, redistribution of land, and organized production.

In the spring of 1943, we conducted the purchase of disaster relief grain to relieve the victims of the Ji Xi disaster, and began to organize mutual aid in production. The landlord Wei Xiao Shan secretly organized the New People's Association, determined Wei Pei Liang as the chairman, and colluded with the enemy to occupy Pan Long, thus entering a sharp struggle; Wei Xiao Shan was publicly tried and shot by the masses, and his property and land were confiscated. According to incomplete statistics, 765 mu of land were confiscated, 160 quilts, 108 jin of tinware, 24 leather boxes (containing silk and satin clothes), four and a half urns of copper coins, 1,000 yuan in silver, 50 cloth bags, and 30 shi of grain. The land change of the four landlord households was that they had a total of 1342 mu of land, sold 215 mu, pawned out 155 mu, and confiscated 765 mu. The entire landlord class reduced land by 88.38%, accounting for 37.22% of the village's total land (490 mu of confiscated land was outside the village).

In 1944, the enemy at Pan Long was forced to retreat, and the masses urgently demanded production. In this year, 27 mutual aid groups were organized, with 173 people, including 32 new middle peasants, 46 poor peasants, 77 middle peasants, and 18 rich peasants, creating the Red Star Brigade and emerging with the district labor hero Wang Hai Cheng, becoming an advanced production village in Wu Xiang. In December, the whole county launched a democratic movement, electing senators. All the masses were involved in the movement. "It is difficult to move Mount Tai without strength, and it is difficult to buy civic rights with money," deeply engraved in the minds of the masses. In particular, the Respect for the Elderly movement, celebrating the elderly, strengthened the relationship between the youth and the elderly, and further strengthened the relationship between the party and the masses, which was an awakening for the elderly who had always been considered stubborn because of their long beards. In the democratic movement, combined with the redistribution of land, the phenomenon of cadres and activists dividing close and good land, and the masses dividing distant and bad land, was corrected. A total of 966.3 mu of land was distributed.

　　十年斗争翻透身
    武乡韩璧实现耕者有其田
    魏效泉
    韩璧是武乡城东一个大村子，有名的八大家魏肖山即是该村的统治者，土地相当集中，抗战以来该村工作开辟较早，可以代表武乡的先进村。该村又是全县生产模范村，从这个村可以看出老区土地改革的历史过程，还可看出农民在取得土地后如何开展了大生产运动，走向富裕的道路。
  （一）战前各阶层土地占有、阶级关系，及地主在经济上政治上剥削压榨农民的特点。
    韩璧土地相当集中，地主高租高利剥削农民，政治上完全统治着农民，正如群众说：“如八路军晚来两年，老百姓就不能活了。”
          战前各阶层土地占有成分  户数  人口      土地      自耕          每人        牲口地主  ４    ２２    １４５７    ７１２        ６５．９    ９经地  ２    １６    ６２．６    １３４        ７．６４    ２富农 ２４  ９５ ４５３．１７ ４９２．２７  ４．８６  １６．５中农  ９３  ２５５  ７５３．４  １０７８．５    ２．９５  ２２１贫农  ３６  ３２５ ７４２．２   ７５３      １．３６  １２．５羊石雇工  １０    １５      ５．２        ５．２      ．３５赤贫  １４    ４８    １３．２                    ．２７合计  ２０７  ７７６  ３５０１．  ７７ ３１５６．９７８４．３３ ２７１
    从这个表可以看出该村土地是非常集中的。地主富农占总户百分之一四·四，占总人口百分之一七·一三，土地就占了百分之六一·六；中贫雇赤贫合占总户百分之八四·九一，占人口百分之八二·六四，仅占土地百分之三九·四。为什么会是这样呢？从下述地主的发家及对农民的剥削情形即可明白：
    该村四户地主最大的是八大家魏肖山，四户共有土地二一○三亩，魏肖山即占一四一九·六亩。古传韩璧地形是“凤凰双展翅”，南寨魏肖山为头，东头魏文兰，北院魏二苟为腋下之肥肉，北寨魏镜为前胸，全村穷人即凤凰之羽毛；又名“金线吊葫芦”，南寨是个葫芦，由村通南寨之小道为金线，葫芦里有三十余座砖炮楼院。这两个典故，是为了欺骗农民，说地主发家是住在了有福之地，穷人生来命穷。但这种欺骗农民的神话，已为觉悟的农民透彻的识破，从地主的发家和对农民的剥削是看的很清楚的：
    “金线吊葫芦”，穷人血汗吸里头：据八十八岁的老人谈：魏家是明朝财主，当时当铺即有四二座，烟里十三顷地魏家即有十二顷。光绪三年灾荒，劳动人民大批饿死，地主有地得不来租，魏家便处于没落之境。民国以来，魏家出了民国官，加之蒋阎大战，人民负担加重，农村迅速趋向破产，魏家便大量集中了土地，破落的魏家又恢复起来，它对农民的剥削是无空不入的。
    １、高租吃人：四户地主二一○三亩地，出租一三九一亩，占地主土地百分之六六·一。租率百分之五○，每亩三大斗细粮，大斗收租（本村大一升外村大二升），二四村佃户，被剥削着。只魏肖山一户年收租米三三六石。
    ２、高利盘剥：四户地主即放一○二○○○元，富农九户放高利四五○○元。只南寨一户即放七万元，债户达五二村，远至五十里外，本村有纸可考者放有一八六八三元，月利二分五，一年可得五六○四元，可买米一三一石，算十年账，即有五六○四○元银洋，即一三○○石农民血汗吸进了地主的葫芦里。全村二○七户，揭钱者一六二户，占总户百分之七八·二。在一六二户中，揭钱落地者二四户，富农五户，下地四五亩；中农一五户，下地一四五亩；贫农四户，下地五一亩；共下地二四一亩。逼着生孩还未满月的杨兴田母亲给担煤炭顶利息，黑小、邦景等三户，因揭钱上不了利而倾家荡产，可见一斑。
    ３、商业兼高利贷：据民国二十四年调查，只南寨一户商业收入每年八千元，占其整个收入的百分之五五。坑人最重的是药铺与官盐店，人人逃不过。因生病不能不吃药，不能不吃盐，只要你上了勾就难逃脱。
    ４、雇佣剥削也很厉害：据民国二十四年统计，南寨一户即用三十八个人，年出工资五二八元。其中羊工一二人，年年每人赚工资二一·六元，另有羊工五人，每人年赚工资二四元。使女六人，每人年赚五元。厨夫三人、打杂三人、看门二人、磨面一人、照看一人、收租三人、管账二人，每年每人赚五元至十元。他们待工人如牛马，使女三娥侍候地主十年后，被地主当牛马出卖了三百元银洋，六百元纸票。
    ５、非法掠夺与超经济剥削：每当锄苗夏收秋收时，全村农民都得给地主白帮工三、四日，凡揭钱租地户，只要人家吭一声，都得放下家里生活去给地主作活，这已成为贯例了。民国十九年晋钞倒台，地主魏文兰用晋钞赎地三百亩，当他刚把钱交给农民，便出了布告晋钞作废，这种坑人事农民死也忘不了。
    地主不仅在经济上剥削农民，在政治上完全统治着农民，由于地主有许多民国官，凡是作官的都得打招呼，本村农民压的出不上气来。只要一见地主，南寨下村人人起立，个个问安。魏文兰更是仗势欺人，全村妇女被其强奸污辱者七十二人，骑马踏着马夫的肩，雇工李效成因赶集回迟被痛打一顿。史成迁、魏培良是经营地主，两次任村长，贪污仓谷，逼死王冬花姐，逼着寡妇不出史家门，魏培良引敌害死了李仙果男人。总之，地主压迫群众的事太多了。
    （二）抗日战争中土地变化
    甲、三七年——四一年，反贪污，掌政权，分配“开明”地，初步组织群众。
    三七年冬，教五团到韩璧，组织自卫队，宣传组织布袋队，进行了反贪污斗争，魏培良倒出贪污仓谷二十石，群众开始成立了农会，劳英王海成是第一任农会主席。但政权仍为阎之受训村长所统治，魏培良根本没低头。
    三八年群众选矿工白俊如当了村长，地主魏肖山当然不服劲，随即发生了抓赌抢印事件，地主以抓赌为名，捆住我村长，抢了村公所公章，随即诱骗二、三百人到区请愿，吃的是白面。农民也组织了一、二十人去保村长，拿的是糠干粮，但终于扣押魏肖山，白俊如仍为村长，这一胜利是韩璧开天辟地以来第一次。正如李效成老汉说：“看着狗日走了阴凉地，倒霉时候来了。”
    三九年大屯粮，南寨出了五百石，屯粮后，地主将用人种的九二亩地伴种出去，这时租息开始停止了。
    四○年魏家地主退入朱家山，但仍暗中进行破坏活动。三次“扫荡”后，国民党大造谎言，反对共产党，我某游击队住南寨，五天瓦解了一个排，带枪潜逃。
    四一年，我们进行了工农青妇大选举，这一次农民第一次选举自己领导人，地主仍不满意，挑拨农民内部团结，利用狗腿魏泉赖我农会主席韩国盛强奸妇女，王海成家有枪，企图这一来摧跨我政权支书，但这一企图又被打破了。年关“扫荡”后，由于战争损失，群众悲观，地主更乘机造谣迷惑人心。
    乙、四二年，减租清债，初步发动了群众。
    四二年开始了减租清债斗争，久受高租高利剥削的农民都卷入了运动，先后对魏肖山、魏文兰进行了斗争。当时的策略是“注意除奸、抓紧土地问题，发动群众，争取魏文兰，孤立魏肖山”。并订出计划提出口号，基本精神内容是“保佃立约要文书”，口号是“不退文书子孙害”，“有仇报仇，有冤报冤”。干部向群众宣誓“不拿文书不走”，干部有缺点作了自我批评，密切了干群关系，集中力量斗顽固。魏文兰中学毕业，任过旧政府科长，三九年曾自动“开明”地一百亩，群众误认为是“开明”分子，这次斗争他又表示“开明”，承认民国十九年晋钞抽地之错误，强奸妇女未作覆，群众一直喊：“拥护开明士绅”；另一口号是“开明不是自动的，不斗不开明”，共退书本洋三八○○元，利三百元，退地三○亩，租地订十年。魏肖山很顽固，只退一部文书，群众喊“反对顽固分子等天变”，“反对有粮不出粮”。经过四十天斗争，八十个群众刨出四个窑洞，刨出粮一六○石，烂了一百石，群众更加愤怒，这次退出文书钱本四万串，银洋七千元，租米从二百石减为一百五十石，八扣交租只出一百二十石。下地归债户三五五亩，连“开明”地共五一一亩，占全村土地百分之一五·六一，占地主土地百分之四二·五一，全村一六二户佃债户获得了利益。据统计得土地四一户，得地一二七亩，其中贫农二八户分地九三·一，中农十二户分地三一·六亩，雇工一户分地二·四亩。
    总之，四二年运动规模相当大，大部农民卷入运动，但缺乏思想发动。现在干部检讨，认为当时是干部带头，群众跟上。经过这段运动，二九户贫农上升为新中农，八户赤贫上升为贫农，工人三户升为贫农。各阶层土地人口变化是：
    地主富农土地减少了，合占户口百分之十四·三八。占人口百分之一九·九七，土地减为百分之四七·三一。中农大增，户口占百分之四六·一三，人口占百分之四九，土地占百分之三八·二一。赤贫农占户数百分之三八·九三，占人口百分之三○·二，占土地百分之一三·九三。
