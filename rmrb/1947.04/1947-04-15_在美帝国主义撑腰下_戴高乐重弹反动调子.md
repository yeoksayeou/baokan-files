Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, April 11th: Paris dispatch: De Gaulle, the head of the French reactionaries, who is currently touring the northeastern border of France, recently delivered two speeches in Strasbourg, in which he vehemently criticized the current measures of the French government and the parliamentary system, and arbitrarily smeared various progressive political parties. In his second speech, De Gaulle advocated the establishment of a so-called "French People's Union" to fight against existing political parties. The progressive newspapers in France were extremely dissatisfied with De Gaulle's reactionary speeches and published articles to severely refute them. The French Communist Party's newspaper, L'Humanité, wrote: De Gaulle's two speeches in Strasbourg did not contain any new ideas or constructive opinions, but were merely a repetition of reactionary rhetoric. Furthermore, Wallace, who recently arrived in England, also revealed that De Gaulle's recent reactionary activities were promoted by the reactionary foreign policy of the United States.
Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, April 8th: De Gaulle, the head of the French reactionaries, betrayed the interests of the people during his tenure as Chairman of the post-war French Provisional Government, emphasizing military expansion and anti-Soviet diplomacy. After his downfall in January last year, he engaged in anti-communist and anti-democratic activities with the covert support of US imperialists. Recently, De Gaulle, disregarding the abandonment of the vast majority of the French people and various progressive parties, openly engaged in political activities to oppose the new constitution passed by the national referendum in October last year. According to a United Press dispatch from Paris: De Gaulle has been running around recently, conspiring to instigate a movement against the new constitution, vainly attempting to become the dictator of France, and has decided to expand the scope of his speaking tour to include Bordeaux, Nice, Marseille, and Lyon.

　　在美帝国主义撑腰下
    戴高乐重弹反动调子
    【新华社陕北十一日电】巴黎讯：旅行于法国东北边境之法国反动派头子戴高乐，顷在斯特拉斯堡先后发表两次演说，对当前法国政府措施及议会制度大肆诋毁，并恣意诬蔑各进步政党。戴氏在其第二次演说内，曾主张成立所谓“法国人民联盟”，以与现有政党相抗争。法国各进步报纸对戴高乐反动演说极表不满，纷纷著论予以严厉驳斥。法共机关报人道报写道：戴高乐在斯特拉斯堡发表之二次演说，无丝毫新思想与建设性之意见，不过为反动调子之重弹而已。又，新近抵英之华莱士亦揭露戴高乐最近之反动活动系由美国反动派外交政策所促成。
