The land reform movement has re-emerged in the base villages of Pinglu.

[Our newspaper's dispatch from Taiyue, 15th] Since late February, the land reform movement has re-emerged in Pinglu, with land redistribution struggles unfolding in nineteen base villages. After the Kuomintang army returned to southern Shanxi, the mass movement association in the county temporarily halted. Since late February, five districts and nineteen base points have restarted the struggle. The development of each base point varies; some are distributing the fruits, some have reached the climax of the movement, and some are beginning to brew. It is estimated that the Second, Third, and Fifth Districts can be largely completed in April, and the forces will be transferred to the edge of the First and Fourth Districts, advancing towards the enemy-occupied point and line villages. The people of the county, tempered by the cruel war, deeply understand the necessity of arming themselves. Therefore, from the very beginning of this movement, they have combined armed forces with land redistribution. Villages such as Yaozhangping in the Second District and Nangou in the Third District are frequently threatened by Kuomintang special agent armed forces. The militia cooperates with the Public Security Bureau to patrol the Yellow River, uncovering nineteen "underground lines" of Kuomintang special agents, protecting the mass struggle. As soon as the Fifth District Office was established, farmers volunteered to join the district cadre team. They said, "Armed forces are our backing. With armed forces, we can redistribute the land!" In Xibei Village, three miles away from the enemy, the masses held meetings in the ravines with guns on their backs, settling accounts with the landlords. At the same time, militia rotation teams in each district actively attacked the enemy from time to time, cracking down on armed Kuomintang special agents, bolstering the masses and bolstering their courage. Secondly, they educate the masses, distinguish the objects of struggle, and consolidate and expand the strength of the peasants. The Third and Fifth Districts of the county used to be the ruling areas of Kuomintang special agent armed forces Zhang Tongwen, and many farmers were forced to serve as puppet village police and "Civilian Security Teams." In Qijiahe Village, with more than 200 households, more than 130 people had served in the "Civilian Security Team" or as puppet staff. Actives in Qijiahe Village found eight people at once to prepare for a major struggle. However, Shen Xicai, Zhang Lianwa and others were (poor peasants) who had served as puppet village police. The landlord Wang Chengyu took the opportunity to instigate them to escape. Two of them ran to the Kuomintang-occupied area, and eventually cried because they realized that there was no way to defect to the enemy, and returned to the village, asking the masses to punish them. At this time, the masses realized that they were poor peasants and adopted a policy of winning them over and educating them. The leadership also promptly explained the policy of leniency, and finally concentrated the struggle on Wang Chengyu, while other waverers stood on the side of the peasants. Zhang Hezeng, a farmer in Zhaohuzhuang, had served as a village policeman in the puppet village office for three months, and the masses wanted to struggle against him. The leadership guided the masses to wash his face and wipe away his darkness, and released him. He was so moved that he swore to everyone that he would capture two secret agents to atone for his crimes. In the universal struggle in the county, many small puppet bandit personnel were won over. After the struggle in Chaoyangpo, a "family meeting" was held to explain that the peasants were all one family and that those who had been puppet bandits were all prodigal sons and should accept the education of their brothers in the future. This consolidated and strengthened the peasant forces.

　　平陆各基点村
    分田运动再起
    【本报太岳十五日电】二月下旬以后，平陆土地改革运动再起，十九个基点先后展开分田斗争。该县于蒋军回师晋南后，群运会一时停滞。二月下旬以后，五个区十九个基点又重新展开斗争。各基点发展情况不一致，有的正分果实，有的运动已达高潮，有的开始酝酿，估计四月份内二、三、五区可大体完成，转移力量至一、四区边沿，向敌占之点线村庄推进。该县人民经过残酷的战争锻练，深知武装自己的必要，所以此次运动一开始，皆以武装结合分田。二区姚张坪及三区南沟等村，经常受到蒋特武装威胁，民兵便配合公安局巡守黄河，破获蒋特十九个“底线”，保卫了群众斗争。五区区公所刚成立，农民便自报奋勇去参加区干队。他们说：“武装便是我们的靠山，有了武装就能分田！”距敌三里的西北庄，群众背着枪在山沟里开会，与地主进行清算。与此同时，各区皆有民兵轮战队不时主动出击敌人，打击武装国特，结群众撑腰壮胆。其次教育群众，分别斗争对象，巩固扩大农民力量。该县三、五区过去曾是蒋特武装张同文的统治地区，农民被迫充当伪村警及“民安队”者甚多。祁家河村二百余户，即有一百三十余人当过“民安队”或伪工作人员。祁家河积极分子一次便找到八个人准备大斗。但其中申喜才、张联娃等都是（赤贫农）当过伪村警的，地主王成玉便趁隙活动他们逃跑。有两个跑到蒋占区，终因三思投敌无路而痛哭起来，重新回到村里，要求群众处分。此时，群众认识到他们是赤贫，采取了争取教育，领导上亦及时解释宽大政策，最后将斗争锋芒集中到王成玉身上，其他动摇者便纷纷站到农民方面来。招呼庄中农张合曾在伪村公所当过三个月村警，群众要斗争他。领导上便引导群众给他洗脸擦黑，释放了。他感动的向大家宣誓，要捉两个特务来将功折罪。在全县普遍斗争中，争取了许多小的伪匪人员。朝阳坡在斗争后召开了“家庭会议”，说明农民都是一家人，当过伪匪的都是败家子，以后要接受弟兄们的教育。这样巩固与壮大了农民力量。
