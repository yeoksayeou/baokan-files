Boldly Mobilize the Masses to Distribute and Protect Land
    The Guerrilla War in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Region Deepens and Expands
    [Special Dispatch from this Newspaper] The guerrilla war in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region is currently developing in depth and expanding. Wherever the Chiang Kai-shek troops go, they are attacked by guerrillas. This powerful guerrilla corps behind enemy lines vigorously carries out the struggle of "holding a gun in one hand and distributing and protecting land with the other" in all villages occupied by the Chiang Kai-shek forces, effectively protecting the democratic order in the countryside. They attack the Chiang Kai-shek troops day and night, creating favorable conditions for the main forces to continue annihilating them. In the past five months (from September of last year to January), the guerrilla war in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region has created many valuable experiences. To this end, this reporter interviewed a responsible person in the area, who relayed the following experiences of the guerrilla war in the region:
    In the past five months, the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region has undergone two major changes: The first time the Chiang Kai-shek troops invaded the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region, there was some confusion due to insufficient preparation at the time. The District Party Committee then proposed: "Prepare the entire region to fight guerrillas, the county should not leave the county, the district should not leave the district, persist on the spot, and no withdrawal is allowed." Under this call, county and district cadres and armed forces organized work teams, and the prefectural committee and sub-districts organized guerrilla groups, and the situation immediately changed. The second time the Chiang Kai-shek troops invaded the area south of the Yellow River, the main force of the Chiang Kai-shek troops was largely annihilated and weakened by us, and the local reactionary "Homecoming Legions" were also largely eliminated. However, our local armed forces and guerrillas were stronger than before, the confidence of the masses was unprecedentedly high, and the landlords' concerns also increased, and they dared not easily "settle accounts" with the masses, and the whole situation was very different from the first time. According to extremely incomplete statistics: In the past five months, the anti-enemy guerrilla forces in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region fought the enemy a total of 250 times, killing, wounding, and capturing 8,007 enemy soldiers.
            As long as we persevere, we will win
    Five months of experience first proves that the guerrilla war in the occupied areas, as long as we persevere, we can persevere, and perseverance will lead to victory. The masses who have just been occupied are still very enthusiastic, and they reach out for assistance; the landlords who have been struggled against are just the opposite, they sit and watch the situation, fearing that the world will change - and become the world of the people again (with the exception of a few extremely wicked people). As long as we persist in carrying out armed struggle, the landlords will soften, and the masses will harden. Because of this, every cadre should consider how to persevere from the beginning, rather than retreat; to boldly launch guerrilla war, rather than passively preserve strength. However, at the beginning of the main force's withdrawal, the masses' greatest concern is often that the cadres will "grow wings" and fly away. The cadres leading the struggle must at this time sincerely swear to the masses, expressing their determination to "share life and death, share weal and woe, and persist in the struggle." The cadres of the Shunhe District of Heze made such a guarantee to the masses, and the masses immediately enthusiastically replied: As long as you don't leave, we will definitely protect you. Experience proves that the cadre's determination to lead by example and correct guidance is the prerequisite for persisting in the struggle. Unless absolutely necessary (such as when the Chiang Kai-shek troops are concentrated in one area, temporarily occupying the surface; but this situation will not last long), all should persevere and ensure the rural base areas. When it is absolutely necessary to withdraw, they should be inserted in time when the enemy transfers or disperses. Because the organizations in various villages often do not collapse under the pressure of a large enemy, but often collapse under the "encirclement and suppression" and retaliation of the "Homecoming Legions" and bad landlords. Therefore, they must be inserted immediately when there is a gap. When the large enemy has just left, the small enemy has just arrived, the "Homecoming Legions" have not yet gained a firm foothold, the bad landlords want to move but have not moved, and the reactionary rule has not yet been established, we take advantage of the situation to counterattack, which is the easiest to restore the base area and maintain the vitality of the masses. The later the insertion, the greater the difficulty, and the more difficult it is to enter. Even if they are forced to withdraw temporarily, a small number of cadres who have close ties with the masses and small troops who are good at concealing their activities should be left behind to control the landlords and support the masses. If we are prepared in advance and the enemy comes later, and it is not a dense but a general multi-pronged attack, then we should resolutely carry out persistent struggle on the spot.
            Take the initiative to attack and fight annihilation battles
            Rely on the masses to move flexibly
    How to persevere? Five months of experience proves that the general guiding principles for combat in persisting in struggle are mainly the principle of active offense (the enemy advances, I advance; the enemy does not advance, I also advance), the principle of annihilation (no matter how many, annihilation is good), and the principle of combining with the masses (fighting for the interests of the masses). Implementing these principles can preserve ourselves and annihilate the enemy. Only by attacking can we be proactive and adaptable; passivity will inevitably lead to beatings. If the enemy concentrates, we will disperse and trap the enemy, and attack the enemy's claws and teeth. If the enemy advances in parallel, we will support the militia with part of the battalion's troops, and jointly defend and block the enemy village by village, and we can retreat during the day and advance at night to harass the enemy. If the enemy is dispersed, we will concentrate appropriately and use surprise attacks and ambushes to annihilate the enemy's local corps, and attack the stubborn district headquarters and break their bunker policy. The guerrillas should organize the masses to jointly defend against the enemy's nighttime arrests and cattle thefts. When the enemy advances, I also advance, destroying its depth. When the enemy retreats, I also advance, attacking the suburbs and the stragglers on both sides of the transportation line. When our main force enters a certain area, the local troops should insert themselves behind the enemy's flanks to attack the enemy's supply lines and intercept the enemy's routed troops. Secondly, in fighting annihilation battles, we should attack the weak and not the strong, so that we can become richer and richer with each battle; attrition warfare will make us thinner and thinner with each battle. In opposing the enemy's "mopping up" and "encirclement and suppression," we must also pay attention to timely concentration and dispersal, and the combination of external maneuver and internal persistence. If the enemy's forces are too large, we can disperse to the enemy's flanks and rear to annihilate the local reactionaries, especially the command center. If the enemy's forces are not large, we can concentrate and annihilate one route. At this time, county and district cadres, guerrilla teams, and work teams must rely on the masses for cover and rely on tunnels to move flexibly in the hinterland, coordinating with external operations. In this way, we can smash the enemy's "mopping up" and persist in the struggle in the hinterland. When resisting "mopping up" and "encirclement and suppression," we must avoid stacking up; stacking up will inevitably lead to beatings; do not face the enemy head-on, facing the enemy head-on will lead to setbacks. Troops transferred to the outside line should not stay on the outside line for a long time; one day late will cause no small loss.
            Only by fighting for the masses can we have the masses participate in the war
    Five months of experience also proves that in the anti-enemy guerrilla war, only by fighting for the masses can we have the masses participate in the war, and only then can we form a mass guerrilla war. The central link of the guerrilla war fighting for the masses is the struggle of "distributing land and protecting land." All those places that quickly launched a guerrilla war and resolutely suppressed the restoration of bad elements can well maintain the mass base; the landlords dare not act rashly for fear of the world changing. All those places that can vigorously support the peasants and force the landlords to return grain and land, the peasants dare to rise up and carry out the struggle against settling accounts in reverse; all the areas where the guerrilla war is better developed, the demands of the masses are higher, and they quickly develop from demanding the return of grain and land to demanding the abolition of the baojia system, the restoration of the democratic order, and retaliating against the bad elements. We should meet this demand of the masses, from small-scale settling accounts in reverse to large-scale vigorous support, and organize the masses to launch the movement to settle accounts in reverse and seek revenge. The experience of the armed land protection struggle also proves that in areas that have undergone such mobilization of the masses and guerrilla warfare, the peasants can gain an advantage, the fighting spirit is high, the landlords bow their heads and compromise with the peasants, the losses of the masses are generally small, and they can support any struggle; therefore, the central task of the guerrilla war must be the struggle of holding a gun in one hand and distributing land and protecting land in the anti-Chiang Kai-shek struggle. Unilaterally emphasizing the anti-Chiang Kai-shek united front is to be divorced from the masses; failure to solve the land problem in the guerrilla war will inevitably lead to the failure of the guerrilla war.
            Thoroughly reform the organizational form
    Five months of experience also proves that the organizational forms and habits of peace must be thoroughly reformed, and everything should be suitable for guerrilla war. In leadership, several guerrilla groups should be divided according to the situation to persist in the struggle separately, but a monolithic and strong core must be maintained. In terms of style, the combination of obedience to discipline and bold creation should be emphasized, a merit-based movement should be launched, models should be commended in a timely manner, the good should be rewarded, and the bad should be punished without indulgence. This has a great relationship with the development of guerrilla war.
    Due to the correct implementation of the above principles of guerrilla war, the scale of the guerrilla war on the southern front of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Yellow River has now expanded to 45 counties. Its battle achievements in the first half of March alone, according to incomplete statistics, include more than 20 major battles, capturing more than 500 enemy soldiers, killing and wounding more than 100, and seizing 48 vehicles and many other spoils of war. These achievements are by no means accidental.
    For future tasks, Hebei-Shandong-Henan proposes: Take out all forces, boldly persist in the struggle, transform all guerrilla areas into guerrilla base areas and base areas, and open up the occupied areas that have not yet been recovered. Boldly mobilize the masses, hold a gun in one hand and distribute land and protect land in the other, universally swear with the masses, share life and death, and never retreat. The armed forces and the regime directly support the distribution of land and the protection of land, and strive to eliminate the "Homecoming Legions" and control the landlords. In battle, special attention should be paid to building the army. We must not only improve the combat effectiveness of the existing troops, but also strengthen the local corps. County and district cadres must carry out various construction and preparation work in all war gaps, otherwise they will be paralyzed and slack during the gaps, and they will be panicked and confused when the enemy "sweeps." They will not be able to smash the "sweeping" well, nor can they improve quickly.

　　放手发动群众分田保田
    冀鲁豫游击战深入扩展
    【本报特讯】冀鲁豫游击战争，目前正在深入扩大的发展。蒋军所到地区，到处遭到游击队的打击。这支强大的敌后游击兵团，他们在一切蒋占村庄猛烈开展一手执枪、一手分田保田的斗争，有力的保护了农村民主秩序。他们不分昼夜的给蒋军以打击，又给主力军创造了继续歼灭蒋军的良好条件。五个月来（去年九月至一月），冀鲁豫区游击战争已创造出许多宝贵的经验；为此，记者特走访该区某负责人，承其转告该区游击战争经验如下：
    五个月中，冀鲁豫经过两次巨大变化：第一次蒋军侵入冀鲁豫区时，由于当时准备不够，表现出有些混乱，当时区党委提出：“准备全区打游击，县不离县，区不离区，就地坚持，不许退出。”在这一号召下，县区干部和武装，组织起武工队，地委分区组织起游击集团，局面即行转变。第二次蒋军侵入黄河以南地区时，蒋军主力大部为我歼灭削弱，土顽“还乡团”亦大部消灭，而我地方武装与游击队，却较前增强，群众信心空前提高，地主顾虑也随之增多，再不敢轻易向群众“倒算”，整个形势与第一次已大不相同。据极不完全的统计：五个月来，冀鲁豫敌后游击部队，与敌共作战二五○次，毙伤俘敌八千零七人。
            只要坚持就能胜利
    五个月的经验首先证明：沦陷区的游击战争，只要坚持就能坚持，坚持就能胜利。刚沦陷后的群众，情绪仍极高昂，他们伸手待援；被斗地主则恰恰相反，他们坐观风色，害怕变天——再变成人民的天下（个别罪大恶极者例外）。只要我们坚持进行武装斗争，地主就会软下来，群众就会硬起来。正因如此，每个干部，一开始就应考虑如何坚持，而不是退却；是放手发动游击战争，而不是消极保存。但在主力撤退之初，往往群众最大的顾虑是怕干部“长翅膀”飞走。领导斗争的干部，此时必须向群众诚心诚意的宣誓，表示自己“同生死，共患难，坚持斗争”的决心。荷泽顺河区干队向群众作了这样的保证，群众即马上热情的答复：只要你们不走，我们一定掩护。经验证明：干部决心领导带头及指导正确，就是坚持斗争的前提。除非万不得已情况（如蒋军猬集一片地区，暂作面的占领；但此种情况，决不会长久），一律均应坚持，确保农村阵地；万不得已撤出时，应于敌转移或分散时，及时插入。因各村组织，往往不垮于大敌压境，而常常垮于“还乡团”坏地主之“清剿”报复。故须一有空隙立即插入；大敌刚走，小敌刚来，“还乡团”立脚未稳，坏地主想动未动，反动统治尚未建立，我趁势反扑，最易恢复阵地，保持群众元气。插入愈晚，困难愈大，进去愈难。即使被迫暂时撤出时，亦应留少数与群众血肉联系的干部，与善于隐蔽活动的小部队，控制地主支持群众。如我准备在前，敌来在后，不是密集而是一般的几路进攻，那么我们就应就地坚决的进行坚持斗争。
            主动进攻打歼灭战
            依靠群众灵活跳动
    怎样坚持？五个月经验证明：一般坚持斗争的作战指导原则，主要是主动进攻原则（敌进我进，敌不进我亦进），歼灭原则（不论多少，消灭就好），与群众相结合原则（为群众利益而战），实行这些原则才能保存自己，歼灭敌人。进攻才能主动，才能随机应变，被动必然挨打。敌若集中，我即分散困敌，打敌爪牙。如敌平行推进，我则以部分营兵支持民兵，联防逐村阻击，并可昼退夜进，扰袭敌人。如敌分散，我则适当集中，以袭击、伏击歼灭敌人地方兵团，应打顽区部据点，打破其碉堡政策。游击队则组织群众联防，防敌夜间抓人牵牛。当敌前进时我也前进，破坏其纵深。敌退我亦前进，打击其城郊及交通线两侧之游杂。当我主力进入某一地区时，地方部队应插入敌侧后，打敌补给，截敌溃军。其次打歼灭战应打软不打硬，这样才能愈打愈肥；消耗战则愈打愈瘦。在反对敌人“扫荡”清剿时，又必须注意适时的集中与分散，外线机动与腹地坚持相结合。如敌兵力过大，我可分散出敌侧后，歼灭土顽，特别是指挥中枢。如敌兵力不大，我可集中歼其一路。此时县区干队、游击队、武工队，必须在腹地依靠群众掩护与依托地道灵活跳动，策应外线作战，如此即能粉碎敌人“扫荡”，坚持腹地斗争。反“扫荡”反“清剿”切忌堆聚，堆聚必遭挨打；不要迎头，迎头会碰钉子。转到外线部队，亦不宜久留外线，晚进一天即会造成不小损失。
            只有为群众而战  才能有群众参战
    五个月的经验又证明：敌后游击战争，只有为群众而战，才能有群众参战，才能形成群众性的游击战争。为群众而战的游击战争的中心环节，就是“分田保田”的斗争。凡是很快搞起游击战争，坚决进行了镇压复辟坏蛋的地方，都能很好保持群众阵地；地主因怕变天而不敢轻举妄动。凡能大力给农民撑腰，压迫地主还粮还地的地方，则农民就敢于起来进行反倒算斗争；凡是游击战争愈开展得好的地区，群众要求愈是提高，他们由要求还粮倒地的斗争，就很快发展到要求取消保甲恢复民主秩序，向坏蛋进行报复。我们应满足群众这一要求，由点滴的反倒算到大规模的大力撑腰，组织群众反倒算复仇运动。武装保田斗争的经验又证明：凡经过这样发动群众，进行游击战争的地区，农民均能取得优势，斗争情绪高涨，地主低头与农民妥协，群众损失一般很小，并可支持任何斗争；因此游击战争的中心任务，必须是一手拿枪，一手分田的保田抗蒋的斗争，片面强调反蒋统一战线，是脱离群众的；不在游击战争中解决土地问题，必然使游击战争失败。
            彻底改造  组织形式
    五个月的经验又证明：和平组织形式与习惯必须彻底改造，一切应适合于游击战争，领导上应按情况划分几个游击集团，分头坚持斗争，但又必须保持一元化的坚强核心。在作风上应强调服从纪律与大胆创造相结合，展开立功运动，及时表扬模范，好的奖励，坏的处分，决不姑息，这对游击战争开展的关系极大。
    由于正确执行了以上的游击战争的原则，冀鲁豫黄河南线的游击战争的规模，目前已扩展至四十五个县，其战绩仅三月上半月不完全的统计，即进行较大战斗二十余次，俘敌五百余人，毙伤一百余人，缴汽车四十八辆，其他胜利品甚多。这些成绩，绝非偶然。
    对今后任务，冀鲁豫提出：拿出一切力量，放手坚持斗争，变一切游击区为游击根据地和根据地，开辟尚未收复的沦陷区。放手发动群众，一手拿枪一手分田保田，普遍与群众宣誓，生死与共，决不退走，武装与政权直接为分田保田撑腰，为肃清还乡团控制地主而努力。在战斗中，要特别注意建军，要一面战斗，一面整训，不仅要提高现有部队战斗力，而且要壮大地方兵团。县区干队在一切战争空隙要进行各种建设和准备工作，否则空隙时麻痹松懈，敌人“扫荡”时即会恐慌混乱，既不能很好粉碎“扫荡”，又不能迅速提高。
                                                      （柳）
