[This article was transmitted from Taihang on the 2nd] The enemy's rear guerrilla base south of the Yubei Daoqing Railway is being consolidated and strengthened. In the Jiaozuo area, after a certain unit of the Fourth Sub-district swept the outskirts of Jiaozuo in late February, annihilating the pseudo-"Self-Defense Corps" in Zhao Dian and other places, it marched south, coordinating with the local armed forces of the county and district to create an enemy rear guerrilla base. On the 7th, they repelled two companies of the pseudo-prefecture's security regiment stationed in Ningguo. On the night of the 8th, they raided the nest of local tyrants in Heixian Village, capturing more than 20 pseudo-home returning corps tyrants and seizing more than 10 guns, which terrified the local tyrants in the enemy's rear. On the 9th, they also defeated an attack by more than 100 members of the pseudo-Boai Security Regiment. From then on, the enemy, puppets, and tyrants hid themselves in large strongholds. After the initial establishment of the enemy's rear base, a certain unit also seized the gaps in combat to train soldiers on the north bank of the Qin River, with field combat formations, night village attacks, shooting, grenade throwing, and fortification construction as the main subjects of study. Every day at dawn, one could see teams of soldiers in the surrounding fields of the stationed village engaged in intense exercises. Now the combat effectiveness of a certain unit has been greatly improved. A certain detachment with more new soldiers, in the battle of Qicun in Wuzhi, was able to pursue the enemy through the interwoven fire network of three enemy machine guns in an open area where there was no terrain or features to utilize, and only one of our soldiers was slightly injured.
    In the Qinyang area, our enemy's rear base east of the Meng-Qin Highway has been further consolidated after successively crushing four enemy sweeps. Since the local armed forces of the county, in coordination with the sub-district troops, advanced to the east of the road in the last ten days of last month, the enemy's 38th Division headquarters and 177th Brigade headquarters stationed in Qinyang City were greatly panicked. They assembled more than a thousand people and launched an offensive against us for four consecutive days starting on the 25th, but all were repelled by us. On the 28th, our army pursued the enemy directly to the South Gate of Qinyang City. The enemy in the city was in a state of panic, while the nearby masses were jubilant and their confidence in victory was greatly increased. In this battle, more than 80 enemy soldiers, including company commanders and below, were killed, more than 40 were captured, one machine gun and more than 40 rifles were seized, and five enemy artillery towers and more than 20 bunkers were destroyed. Since then, the enemy and puppets have been trapped in strongholds and dare not harass us on a large scale. In the past half month, our local armed forces have also been exceptionally active, killing and wounding more than 40 enemy soldiers, including company commanders and below, capturing more than 20 pseudo-home returning corps tyrants alive, seizing more than 10 rifles, and establishing democratic regimes in 21 villages and towns. The sixth and seventh districts of Qinyang are now entirely under our control, and the masses are in high spirits. The masses in Jiacun asked one after another: "When will you attack the city? We can't live because of Hao Zhande's (pseudo-Wuzhi 'Self-Defense Corps' chief) extortion!" A group of children in Dongmulou surrounded one of our soldiers, clamoring to be taught songs, and said: "When the reactionaries came, we didn't dare to sing these songs. Now that you're here, please teach us." Now the democratic government has convened a meeting of village cadres, and after it ended a few days ago, democratic order has been restored in each village, showing a new atmosphere. In the past half month, the establishment of a guerrilla base in Qinyang has yielded the following experiences: concentrate military forces, destroy the enemy's and puppets' regimes, and actively and flexibly strike at the enemy's incursions. At the same time, the troops resolutely expressed to the masses that they would share life and death with the local masses and made a painful review of the past withdrawals and failure to adhere to the struggle in the original place, apologizing to the masses. They also repeatedly went to the villages where we had been active, and the morale of the masses was greatly stabilized. Secondly, organize cadres to cooperate with the armed forces, disperse to various villages, carry out in-depth propaganda, and establish and transform village regimes. Various symposiums were also held for village cadres, basic masses, families of martyrs, and targets of struggle to explain laws and policies and launch efforts to win over and disintegrate the enemy and puppets (first, good intelligence must be established). At this time, the armed forces shifted from concentrated to dispersed activities and from military-oriented large-circle operations to political-attack-oriented small-circle operations.
    Under the call of the higher authorities to "resolutely fight back to the south of the road and perform meritorious service for the people," the Wuzhi militia and local armed forces, in coordination with the troops, went deep behind enemy lines and launched widespread attacks on the enemy. The Fifth Detachment of the Wugong Team, together with other detachments, proposed a "March Kill the Enemy Competition" plan, and their fighting spirit was extremely high. In four days, they had completed the plan for the entire month. When the team launched a night attack on Zhangjiantun in the county, it completely annihilated the pseudo-home returning corps in the village in just ten minutes of combat, killing and capturing ten, and seizing three guns. On the 7th, the enemy and puppets from Jiaozuo, Ningguo, Encun, and Muluan Town jointly attacked Xiaogao. With the support of the × unit, the team fought bravely and repelled the enemy, killing and wounding more than ten.

### 豫北道清铁路南敌后  游击根据地日益壮大

　　豫北道清铁路南敌后
    游击根据地日益壮大
    【本报太行二日电】豫北我屹立道清路南之敌后游击根据地，正日益巩固壮大。焦作方面，四分区某部继二月下旬横扫焦作外围，歼赵店等地伪“自卫团”后，挥戈南下，配合县区地方武装开创敌后游击根据地。七日，打退驻宁郭之伪专署保安团两个中队。八日夜，奔袭奸霸巢穴黑线村，俘伪还乡团奸霸等二十余人，缴枪十余支，敌后奸霸无不丧胆。九日，又击溃伪博爱保安团百余之进攻。至是，敌伪奸霸敛迹，蛰居大据点内。某部于敌后根据地规模初具后，并抓紧战斗空隙在沁河北岸练兵，以野外战斗队形、夜间村落攻击、射击、投弹及工事构筑等为主要学习课目。每当天色微明，便可见驻村的四周田野一队队的战士在紧张的演习。现某部战斗力已大大提高，新战士较多的某支队于武陟齐村的战斗时，在毫无地形地物可利用之开阔地中，通过敌人三挺机枪的交织的火网追击敌人，我只轻伤一人。
    沁阳方面，我孟沁公路以东之敌后根据地，于连续粉碎敌四次扫荡后，更形巩固。自上月下旬该县地方武装配合分区部队，挺进路东后，驻沁阳城之敌三十八师师部、一七七旅部大为恐慌，曾集结千余人以上，于二十五日起连续四日向我进犯，但皆为我击退。二十八日我军直追敌至沁阳城南关，城内敌恐慌万状，附近群众则欢欣鼓舞，胜利信心倍增。是役，毙敌连长以下八十余名，俘四十余名，缴机枪一挺，步枪四十余支，烧毁敌大炮楼五个，地堡二十余个。自此，敌伪困守据点，不敢大肆出扰。半月来我地方武装亦异常活跃，毙伤敌连长以下四十余，生俘伪还乡团奸霸二十余名，缴步枪十余支，建立廿一个村镇的民主政权。沁阳六、七区已全部为我掌握，群众情绪极高。贾村群众纷纷问：“你们啥时攻城呢？俺们可叫郝占德（伪武陟‘自卫团’长）讹的不能活啦！”东木楼一群小孩围着我一个战士吵着叫教他们唱歌，并说：“反动派来俺这歌也不敢唱了，你们来了，快教我们唱吧。”现民主政府召集村干部会议，于日前结束后，各村已恢复民主秩序，一片新生气象。半月来，沁阳开创游击根据地得出如下几点经验：集中军事力量，摧毁敌伪政权，积极灵活打击敌之进犯。同时，部队向群众坚决表示与当地群众同生死共患难，对于过去的撤退与不坚持原地斗争作沉痛的检讨，向群众道歉。并反复的到我活动过的村子活动，群众情绪大为稳定。其次，组织干部配合武装，分散到各村，进行深入宣传，建立与改造村政权。并召开村干部、基本群众、抗属、斗争对象的各种座谈会，解释法令政策，展开对敌伪的争取、瓦解工作（首先要建立好情报）。武装力量此时由集中趋向分散活动，由军事为主的转大圈与以政攻为主的转小圈。
    武陟民兵地方武装，在上级“坚决打回路南，为民立功”号召下，配合部队，深入敌后，广泛对敌展开出击。武工队第五大队，与各队提出：“三月份杀敌竞赛”计划后，斗志极高，四天已完成全月计划。夜袭该县张建屯时，该队仅以十分钟战斗，即全部歼灭该村伪还乡团，毙俘十名，缴枪三支。七日，焦作、宁郭、恩村、木栾店等敌伪，合击我小高，在×部支援下，该队奋勇冲杀，将敌击退，毙伤敌十余名。
