　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 3rd: According to the Wenhui Daily, March 8th: The armed forces of the Xikang people's uprising have established extensive rural base areas. After abandoning the county towns of Tianquan, Lushan, Rongjing, and Baoxing, the people's army advanced into the vast countryside. The area within ten miles of the city is completely controlled by the people's army, and some have even expanded to the areas of Mingshan and Hongya on the border of Sichuan and Xikang. Currently, the people's army in the province not only has a general headquarters and seven subordinate units, but also a Xikang Political Reform Committee. It is reported that the Xikang uprising troops are known as the People's Self-Defense Army, with Chen Jingwu as the commander-in-chief and Li Yuanheng and Zhao Guoxiang as deputy commanders-in-chief. They are divided into seven brigades and have successively occupied the aforementioned county towns, proposing the slogan "Organize the People's Government."
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 3rd: According to a Central News Agency report: Bai Chongxi, the Chiang family's "plenipotentiary envoy" who went to suppress the Taiwan people's autonomy movement, illegally captured and killed over seventy leaders of the Taiwan people's autonomy movement, including Chen Fulao. Before leaving Taiwan, he also threatened to "severely punish" and "openly execute" all "rebels according to the law." When Bai "inspected" Taiwan a few days ago, he falsely accused the Taiwanese people's demand for autonomy as "deeply influenced by Japanese enslavement education" and demanded that the Taiwanese accept his so-called "motherland culture" (i.e., military "suppression"). However, such intimidating and bloody rhetoric has had no impact on the Taiwan people's autonomy movement. Currently, the people's armed forces are moving into the countryside to engage in resistance. Chiang's Fujian-Taiwan Inspector Yang Lianggong and others are clamoring to "strictly implement rural pacification and confiscate firearms from the people," and Bai Chongxi also had to admit that "Taiwan Province is still in a period of pacification."

　　西康农民抗蒋进一步发展
  　民军建立农村根据地
  　台民不顾蒋家杀戮抵抗仍烈
    【新华社陕北三日电】据文汇报三月八日载：西康民变武装已建立广大农村根据地，民军自放弃天全、芦山、荣经、宝兴等县城后，即转向广大农村挺进，城周围十里外之地区完全为民军控制，一部并扩展至川康边之名山、洪雅一带。现该省民军除设有总司令部及其下辖七个部队番号外，并组有西康政治革新委员会。按西康民变部队号称农民自卫军，以陈经武为总司令，李元亨、赵国祥为副总司令，共分七个旅，曾先后占领上述各县城，并提出“组织人民政府”口号。
    【新华社陕北三日电】据中央社讯：前往镇压台湾人民自治运动之蒋家“全权特使”白崇禧，非法捕杀台湾人民自治运动领袖陈福劳等七十余人后，于离台前又扬言将对一切“叛乱分子”“依法严办”与“明正典刑”。白某日前“巡视”台湾时，曾诬骂台胞之要求自治运动为“受日人奴化教育深重”，并要台人接受他的所谓“祖国文化”（按即武力“征剿”）。但此类带恐吓性之血腥狂言，对台湾人民的自治运动并无任何影响，现人民武装正转入乡村，从事抵抗。蒋记闽台监察使杨亮功等则叫喊要“严格实行清乡，收回民间枪械”，白崇禧亦不得不承认“台省尚在绥靖时期”。
