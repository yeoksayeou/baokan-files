　　Shi Mingsan's Transformation
    Battalion Commander Ji Wenbo
    The messenger Kong Xianzhang jumped and said, "Go and see Shi Mingsan! He's giving a speech again!" Everyone arrived at the stable and saw Shi Mingsan gesticulating and lecturing: "I participated in the May Anti-Raiding Campaign and also went through the Great Production Movement. I've starved. Apart from the leaders, I'm the most senior in the battalion. You kids are far behind." Zhao Changbing interjected, "Of course. Who can compare to Mr. Shi? The founding father of discipline violations."
    "Damn it, you're stating the facts!" Shi Mingsan said anxiously. Hu Nian hurriedly stopped him from cursing, "Old Shi! You should examine yourself. Isn't stealing fodder from the villagers a violation of discipline?" Shi Mingsan argued, "But I did it for the public good!"
    "Then last year, you marched naked through Mazhuangji. Didn't the villagers curse you to death? In Beiguan, Nanle, you stole a cloth bag and sold it for six hundred yuan. When you were supposed to depart with the battalion commander, you feigned illness and came back to steal two watermelons. And..." Little Zhang brought it all out at once. Shi Mingsan dodged away before he could finish. He went to the logistics office and saw a wine pot on the table. The aroma wafted into his nostrils. He knew it was prepared for heroes and models. He restrained himself, but as he turned to leave, he saw half a basket of peanuts on the stove. He grabbed two handfuls and went out to eat. But he regretted it. Who would know if he drank a couple of sips of wine? So he went back and took two sips, which made him feel better and better. Soon, he had finished the whole pot. His stomach felt empty, so he thought of finding something to eat in the kitchen. Coincidentally, the mutton buns had just come out of the pot. He knew they were for the heroes and models, but he was so hungry that he drooled. He reached out and took one. The cook, Yang Cong, couldn't stop him, and he had already eaten half of it. When the quartermaster arrived, he had already bitten into the second one. The quartermaster tied his legs, but he used his free hand to eat a third one. The quartermaster had no choice but to untie him.
    Shi Mingsan, full of wine and food, went to the telephone operator to sing opera. As soon as he entered, the telephone operator said, "Sit down, founding father of discipline violations." The telephone operator always called him that, and he had never been angry. But today, he was anxious. He blushed and said, "Don't talk about me. You've violated discipline too!" "But I can change!" Shi Mingsan continued, "If you can change, so can I."
    "Humph—a dog will always eat shit." The telephone operator said and dodged away! Shi Mingsan also returned to the stable, pulled over the quilt, and went to sleep. Yao Zhenqing felt his head. He had a fever. He hurried to the kitchen to get a bowl of noodle soup, but Shi Mingsan wouldn't drink it, nor would he speak. A while later, the administrator called a meeting to elect the stable squad leader and heroes and models. He seemed determined to be elected, especially as squad leader. Ever since Old Zhang had been transferred, Shi Mingsan had held onto this hope. But the election results were completely the opposite. Yao Zhenqing was elected as the stable squad leader, and he wasn't even mentioned as a hero or model. Instead, his shortcomings were brought up, especially his mass discipline. There seemed to be no end to the discussion.
    Before the meeting adjourned, Shi Mingsan slipped away to the secretary to warm himself by the fire. Hu Nian talked to him for a long time, and almost every sentence mentioned discipline. He really hated these words, so he dodged away! As soon as he went out, he saw a group of people surrounding Xiuling reading the newspaper. He also joined them. "Hey! The founding father of discipline violations is here. Let's go." Everyone scattered with a whoop!
    Old Shi was really bored, so he went back to the stable and slept. But he couldn't fall asleep. The most difficult thing was that no one paid attention to him anymore! He finally closed his eyes, and it was dawn. Xiao Zhang shouted loudly, "Shi Mingsan! Stinking groom, the instructor wants you to prepare the horses?! The heroes are getting impatient!" Shi Mingsan had no choice but to prepare the horses and pull them out. He saw the heroes with flowers, shaking hands with the instructor one by one, and tying red and white ribbons to the horses. Shi Mingsan's hands were freezing, but no one helped him.
    After all the commotion, everyone didn't ride the horses. Shi Mingsan dejectedly pulled the horses back. He wanted to raise an opinion with the administrator, but as soon as he poked his head in, he was pushed out: "Hey! Please go out first, Old Shi. We're in a meeting." He tried to go in again, but the door was already closed.
    Shi Mingsan pushed for a long time, but it didn't move. He was so anxious that he really wanted to curse, but he went back to the stable without cursing. As soon as he entered, Yao Zhenqing asked him why he was unhappy. This sentence touched Old Shi's heart, and he cried out, saying, "People in the battalion headquarters don't pay attention to me. Let me go down to the company!" Yao Zhenqing asked him why? He said, "The administrator is new, and the squad leader is a captured soldier. My five or six years of history is not as good as theirs!" Yao Zhenqing casually replied, "Then who do you blame?" This sentence stung Old Shi's heart even more, and he immediately slapped himself several times, saying, "Blame me! Blame me!" Yao Zhenqing persuaded him for a while before he stopped.
    Shi Mingsan still wanted to find the administrator to explain that he wanted to change. As soon as he went out, he ran into Fei Zi and asked, "Is the administrator in?" "Don't talk to me, founding father of discipline violations!" Fei Zi said and left! Shi Mingsan went back to the stable and cried again. In the end, Yao Zhenqing led him to see the administrator. He announced that he wanted to change and made a plan: 1. Never violate mass discipline, 2. Take good care of the horses and clean up, 3. Help the kitchen deliver water and food to the front. The administrator immediately announced his plan to everyone and praised his determination, but no one believed it: "Will Shi Mingsan really change?" The cook, Yang Cong, wanted to test him. That day, he deliberately gave him a spoonful less of meat. Shi Mingsan's face turned yellow with anger as he held his food bowl! His stomach rumbled several times, but he didn't say a word and walked away. Two days later, Yang Cong asked him if he had any opinions? He said, "No, eat more if you get more, eat less if you get less."
    Really, Shi Mingsan never violated discipline again. Instead, he became a model, often carrying water and sweeping courtyards for the villagers. When he saw the villagers, he called the older ones "Old Aunt" and "Old Uncle." When he was stationed in Fanzhuang, the landlord was particularly kind to him. One day, he was grinding flour until midnight. The landlord automatically brought him a bundle of firewood to light the fire. He didn't want it at all, refusing three or four times, but in the end, he didn't take it. He borrowed things from the villagers and returned them quickly, placing them in the same position. When marching, he always helped the company carry the springboards, often carrying two rifles on his back.
    During the New Year, he was elected as a model in the battalion headquarters. From then on, his enthusiasm increased, and his prestige in the entire battalion greatly improved. People often used him as an example, saying, "A prodigal who returns is more precious than gold!" Later, he applied to join the Party and was approved. Now, he has been elected as a model worker in the entire battalion.

　　石明三的转变
    营长  季文波
    通讯员孔贤章跳着说：“快去看看石明三吧，又在讲演呢！”大家到了马号见石明三果然指手划脚的训话：“老子参加过五月反扫荡，也经过大生产，挨饿，全营除了首长以外，数我资格老，你们这些毛孩子们差的多。”赵长丙接口说：“当然罗，谁能比石先生呐？犯纪律的老祖宗。”
    “妈的，你说出事实来！”石明三着急的说。虎年忙制止他别骂街，“老石！你应当检讨自己，经常偷老乡的马料那不是犯纪律吗？”石明三辩驳说：“那我是为了公家呀！”
    “那么去年行军你光着屁股在马庄集过，老乡没骂你死兵？在南乐北关，偷人家一条布袋卖了六百块钱。跟营长出发你装病回来偷人家两个西瓜，还有…………………”小张且一下都给他端出来了。石明三不等他说完就躲着走了；到了事务处，见桌子上放着个酒壶，一股一股的香气往鼻子里钻，他知道这是给英雄和模范准备的，自己耐着性子，才一回头想走，见锅台上放着半簸箕花生，顺便抓了两把就出去吃。可是后悔，喝两口酒谁能知道呢？于是又返回去喝了两口，越喝越得劲，一会一壶酒喝光了。肚子里像饿似的，就想到伙房找点啥吃，恰巧羊肉饱子才出锅，他也知道是叫英雄模范吃的，可是急的直流口水，伸手拿了一个，炊事员杨从一把没拉住，早吃了一半。司务长来了已经咬开了第二个，司务长绑着他两条大腿，他用闲着的手又吃了第三个。司务长没法，又给他解开。
    石明三酒足饭饱，找电话员去唱戏，一进门电话员就说：“坐吧！犯纪律的老祖宗。”电话员总是这么叫他，从来没有恼过，今天可急了，他红着脸说：“别说我，你犯的纪律也不少哇？”“可是我能改呀！”石明三接着说：“你能改我也能改。”
    “哼—狗还改了吃屎。”电话员说了一句就躲着走了！石明三也回了马号，拉过被子就睡。姚振青摸了摸他的头，有点发烧，忙到伙房弄了碗面条汤来，石明三长短不喝，也不说话。一会管理员召集开会选举马号班长和英雄模范，他像无论如何得选上他一样，特别是班长，自从老张调走以后，石明三就抱着这个希望，可是选举的结果完全相反，马号班长选的姚振青，英雄模范根本就没提他，反而提了他些缺点，特别是群众纪律，说起来就没完了。
    石明三不等散会，就溜到书记那去烤火，虎年又给他谈了半天，差不多每句话都提到纪律，他实在讨厌这些话，就躲着走了！一出门见一群人围着秀龄读报，也凑了去。“嘿！犯纪律的老祖宗来了，咱们走哇。”哄的一下就散了！
    老石真是无聊，回马号就睡，可是总睡不着，最难受的是大伙都不理自己了！好容易合上眼，天就发亮。小张旦大声叫道：“石明三！臭马夫，教导员叫你备马呢？！英雄们等急了！”石明三没法，只得备好拉出去，见英雄们带着花，一个一个的和教导员握手，看见马就你接红的我接白的，石明三冻的手痛也没人接。
    闹了半天，大家又不骑了，石明三垂头丧气的把马拉回去，想找管理员提个意见，才一伸头，叫人家推出来了：“喂！先请出去吧老石，我们在开会。”他再想进去，门已闭住。
    石明三推了半天，一动不动，急的他真想骂街，可是没有骂就回马号了，一进门姚振青问他为什么不高兴，这句正碰着老石的心坎，哇的一声就哭了，说：“营部人们不理我了，叫我下连吧！”姚振青问他到底为啥？他说：“管理员是新的，号目是个俘虏兵，我五六年的历史还不如人家强哪！”姚振青不在意的接了一句：“那你怪谁呢？”这句更刺痛了老石的心，立时抽了自己一阵嘴巴说：“怪我！怪我！”姚振青又劝了他一会才完了。
    石明三还是想找管理员去说明自己要转变，一出门碰上费子就问“管理员在吗？”“别理我，犯纪律的老祖宗！”费子说着就走了！石明三又回到马号哭起来。结果还是姚振青领着他见了管理员；宣布自己要改，并订了计划：一、永不犯群众纪律，二、好好喂马打扫清洁，三、帮助伙房往前方送水送饭。管理员把他的计划马上向大家宣布，并表扬了他的决心，就是没人相信：“石明三还会转变？”炊事员杨从想试试他，那天吃肉故意少给打了一勺。石明三端着菜盆把脸都气黄了！肚子鼓了几鼓，可是没哼声端走了，过了两天，杨从问他有啥意见？他说：“没啥，多打多吃，少打少吃。”
    真的，石明三再没犯过纪律，反而成了模范，经常给老乡担水扫院子，见了老乡，上年岁的叫老大娘老大爷，在范庄驻的时候，房东看他特别亲，有一天他磨面，一直磨到半夜，房东自动给他抱去一捆木柴点火烤，他长短不要，推让了三四回，始终还是没要。借了老乡的东西，用了很快送还，还给人家放到一定的位置。行起军来，他总帮助连上抬跳板，往往背着二枝枪。
    过年的时候，他当选了营部的模范，自此劲头更大了，在全营的威信也大大提高，人们常拿他为例说：“光棍回头饿死狗！”后来他又要求入党，也通过了，现在他又当选了全营的模范工作者。
