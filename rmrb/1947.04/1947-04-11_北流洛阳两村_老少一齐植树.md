　　Beiliu and Luoyang Villages
　　Old and Young Plant Trees Together
　　[Our newspaper, Licheng News] In order to popularize tree planting throughout the village, Beiliu Village had tree planting expert Liu Shoucheng introduce his tree planting experience at the people's school. It was discovered that there were two ideological concerns in tree planting: one was that one would not be able to use the trees one plants, and the other was that no one would manage the trees once planted. Trees had to be planted every spring, but there was little cultivation, and the trees were eaten by cattle and sheep. The leadership explained this to everyone and let everyone discuss it. After discussion, everyone agreed that it was for their own benefit, and decided: (1) Each production team leader will ensure that men and women aged seven to fifty-five participate in tree planting. (2) Each person must plant two trees and ensure that one tree survives. (3) Establish a tree planting covenant. (4) The chairman of the trade union and the children's work team will jointly manage and protect the trees. (5) Propose mutual inspections between teams and groups. Tree planting expert Liu Shoucheng first planted 24 trees and also grafted 17 fruit trees. Under his influence, tree planting became widespread throughout the village. A total of 166 male full laborers, 221 women, 61 semi-laborers, and 120 children, totaling 568 people, participated. In six days, in addition to completing the plan, they also exceeded the plan by 222 trees, planting a total of 353 timber trees, 238 red date trees, 109 pepper trees, 161 fruit trees, 87 apricot trees, 351 peach trees, 17 jujube trees, and 42 Du pear trees, for a total of 1,358 trees planted throughout the village.

　　[Our newspaper, Shahe News] Under the organization and promotion of the Xingtai Agricultural and Forestry Bureau, Luoyang Village in the Fifth District involved all men, women, old, and young in the afforestation movement. They were divided into five afforestation brigades, with the young and middle-aged and the elderly forming four teams, and the children forming one team. Each team was further divided into several afforestation groups. A total of 858 people participated in the entire village. In just two days of concentrated effort, they planted more than 30,100 willow trees, with an average of 35 trees planted per person. Among them, the children, totaling 158, planted 3,510 trees, with an average of 20 trees per person. The young and middle-aged and the elderly, totaling more than 700 people, planted 26,500 trees, with an average of 37 trees planted per person. In order to protect the trees of Luoyang Village from damage by humans and animals, everyone unanimously agreed to establish a "Forest Management Committee."

　　北流洛阳两村
    老少一齐植树
    【本报黎城讯】北流村为了普及全村植树，特由植树能手刘守城在民校介绍他的植树经验，并发现栽树中存在两种思想顾虑：一种是栽上树自己不能用，一种是栽上也无人管理，每年春天都要栽，光栽扶植不大，都被牛羊吃了，领导上便向大家作解释，让大家讨论。经讨论后，都认为是为了自己，同时决定：（一）各生产大队长保证动员七岁至五十五岁男女都参加植树。（二）每人要栽两株，保证栽活一株。（三）订立植树公约。（四）由工会主席和羊工儿童结合大家管理保护。（五）提出队与队组与组互相检查。植树能手刘守城首先植了廿四棵，还接了十七棵果木树。在他的影响下，全村普遍栽树，计有男全劳力一六六人，妇女二二一人，半劳力六一人，儿童一二○人，共五六八人。在六天内除每人完成计划外，还超过计划二二二棵，共栽树计有木料树三五三棵，红枣树二三八棵，花椒树一○九棵，果树一六一棵，杏树八七棵，桃树三五一棵，枣树十七棵，杜梨树四二棵，全村共植树一三五八棵。（王东魁）
