Heshun's Experience in Universal Training for Peasants
	Tie Cheng, Zi Tang

	In the in-depth movement of mobilizing honest peasants to unite with middle peasants, thoroughly eliminating feudalism, and completing land reform, Heshun adopted a method of large-scale universal training for peasants that combined leadership and the masses. Every peasant entered a "Peasant University" once.

	The entire county conducted universal training for more than 40,000 peasants (including peasants, women, all village cadres, activists, and Party members) in five-day sessions. Initially, the district concentrated on training one session, drawing more conscious peasants from administrative villages for training. They served as the main force, going deep into various base villages to participate in the universal training, with county and district cadres participating in person.

	The training method combined large and small meetings, conducting座谈 (zuò tán - informal discussions), saying whatever was on one's mind, and enlightening ideological awareness; small groups discussed and deliberated, and typical individuals spoke at large meetings. In the training, peasants' own language, forms, content, and experiences were fully adopted to educate themselves, and cadres were also educated, launching a movement of mutual teaching and learning, and self-teaching and self-learning of ideological awareness.

	In the large-scale training, what ideological problems of the peasants were solved, and how were they solved?

	(1) The laboring people are the true masters of the land.

	All things grow from the soil. This issue is the foundation of all issues. If it is not thoroughly resolved, peasants cannot consciously cherish and protect the fruits of labor, and firmly establish a sense of ownership. Solving this problem involved four steps: First, recall history and find the root cause of peasants' poverty and landlords' wealth. Start from current events and seasons (the twelfth lunar month, celebrating the New Year, etc.) to conduct座谈, leading to reflection and grievance. Peasant Zhang Heshang cried out at the meeting, "The landlord took all my land. For thirty years, I had nothing to eat or drink. My father was so angry that he went blind, and my mother, sister, and children all starved to death. I covered myself with a rotten burlap sack at night to sleep." Then Zhao Xiaoma said, "I am sixty-four years old. I started working as a farmhand for the landlord at the age of fourteen, for a full fifty years, planting thirty mu of land. Each year I could harvest fifteen shi of grain, but the landlord, sitting idle, exploited four hundred and fifty shi. How could the landlord not be rich, and why shouldn't we be poor?" At this time, the participating peasants all found the root of their own poverty, realizing that poverty was caused by the landlord's exploitation, and clarifying that exploitation was the root cause of poverty and wealth, and that the landlord's wealth was accumulated from the blood and sweat of us poor people. We are poor because we have been exploited dry by the landlords. So everyone began to calculate the landlord's exploitation account. In Keju base village in the Second District, among the two hundred and thirty-six people, all had their land taken by the landlords. Seventy-eight people did not dare to stay at home during the New Year, and their homes were swept out. One hundred and twelve people had been beaten and scolded by landlords. Twenty-nine people had been sent to prison by landlords. One hundred and eighty-four people had worked as full-time farmhands for their entire lives. Thirty-nine people were still single. Among the two hundred and twenty outsiders in the First District, twenty-two had family members beaten to death by landlords, seventy-eight had starved to death, and one hundred and twenty had been beggars. While complaining and calculating, everyone wept bitterly, arousing the peasants' class hatred. Second, then ask, why did you have to be exploited by the landlords back then? One peasant said, "We drank thin gruel in the morning, ate hand-held cornbread at noon, and drank 張飛趕他媽 (zhāng fēi gǎn tā mā - vegetable soup) in the evening. We couldn't even eat a bean pod or a pumpkin. Without renting land, we wouldn't have anything." Everyone argued, "The landlord has land, we have no way to live. Only by renting the landlord's land can we survive. We can't help being exploited!" At this time, everyone clearly knew that the landlord relied on land to exploit the peasants, but the understanding of who relied on whom to live was still inconsistent. Third, then ask where did the landlord's land come from? Who relies on whom to live? Peasant Wang Liankui said, "My father worked as a farmhand and pawned a barren hillside, and cultivated it for a full eight years, turning it into forty mu of good land. Du Caizhu became jealous and took the forty mu of land away. The landlord never broke a sweat, and he doesn't even know where the land is. All things grow from the soil. If it weren't for us, the landlords would have starved to death long ago. We are the landlord's living gods of wealth. I am the master of the land." From their own historical accounts, the peasants realized that the land problem must be solved. And ideologically affirmed: the land was cultivated by the peasants, the peasants are the true masters of the land, the landlord has been exploiting the peasants for thousands of years, the landlord's land is illegally occupied by the peasants, and the landlord is a false master. Implementing "耕者有其田" (gēng zhě yǒu qí tián - the tillers own their land) is the land returning to its old home.

	(2) Believe in ourselves and unity, not in gods and ghosts.

	After discussing that the peasants are the true masters of the land and that the land should belong to the peasants, superstitious ideas still occupied the minds, which naturally led to the question of whether there are gods and ghosts. One peasant said, "The landlord class uses gods and ghosts to deceive and rule the peasants, saying things like 'eating斋 (zhāi - vegetarian food) and doing good deeds accumulate陰德 (yīn dé - good karma),' 'suffer more in this life, enjoy happiness in the next life,' 'once you enter the道門 (dào mén - Taoist sect), you are not allowed to reveal it, saying that exposing the secrets of the Tao will cause you to be struck by lightning and die in a bloody mess.' I used to follow the Xiangdao (香道 - incense path), but nothing ever happened." Militia member Xing Changsheng said, "When we held a meeting in the Great Temple, we smashed all the 'Grandma Gods,' and they couldn't do anything to us." Everyone recalled that the large and small gods in each village had been smashed, and no family had suffered disaster, clarifying that ghosts and gods are paper tigers used to scare the poor. From the discussion, the masses themselves concluded: ghosts and gods are the landlord's soft method of ruling the people, the gods are all clay figures and paper paintings, and everyone uniting closely is a living god.

	(3) Peasants were slaves in the old society and masters in the new society.

	After solving the problem of superstitious and backward thinking, the idea of social consciousness was naturally put forward. Peasants should grasp the印把子 (yìn bǎ zi - the handle of the seal, meaning power) and the gun to defend themselves. Solving this problem involved two steps: First, since the land belongs to the peasants, why didn't the peasants dare to resist? Du Xiulan said, "In the old society, the yamen (衙門 - government office) belonged to the landlords, the印把子 was in the hands of the landlords. They had armies, prisons, and laws, all of which were designed for the poor. The poor didn't dare to move. A two-finger-wide note would be sent, and we would be beaten and imprisoned. People often say, 'The yamen opens to the south, but don't come in if you have justice but no money.' In the old society, we had no right to speak. In the past, a woman from Keju Village took two ears of corn from her field, and the landlord saw it and insisted that she stole them. She was detained in the village office and forced to hang herself. Her husband went to the county to sue, but he was judged to be a rogue and beaten to death! Two ears of corn cost two lives. Who would dare to say a word?" Second, why can peasants turn over now? One peasant said, "In the new society, peasants have become the masters. We have Chairman Mao leading us. The district chief and county chief are all our own people, making decisions for the poor. Look at who our government is arresting and who the village is struggling against? Aren't they all feudal landlords?" The peasants excitedly said in unison: "What are we afraid of if we are masters and dare not turn over? The world belongs to us peasants. We have turned over and become masters, so we must grasp power and strength, cut off the branches and dig up the roots, and after defeating Chiang Kai-shek, we must also eliminate the big old Chiang."

	(4) As long as the peasants unite and fight, the sky will never change.

	At this time, it was also asked, since we have become the masters of society, why are there still people who dare not take the fruits of struggle? Wang Fubao said, "I am afraid of '天變 (tiān biàn - the sky changing, meaning the political situation changing)' and dare not struggle, and dare not take the fruits of struggle." Du Rulan said, "The sky will never change. The landlord is like苦苦菜 (kǔ kǔ cài - a type of bitter vegetable), and the peasant is like a hoe. If it grows fast, we will hoe it fast, and we will dig out the roots with one or two hoes. The Eighth Route Army has defeated the Japanese devils. Are we still afraid of Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan? We will fight the landlords well in the rear and cut down the trunk of the tree. The Eighth Route Army will dig up the old roots (defeat Chiang Kai-shek) on the front line. If we unite into a piece of iron, and with Chairman Mao's leadership, we will definitely be able to defeat the reactionaries, and the sky will never change." This issue was debated most fiercely.

	(5) Cadres work hard, and the masses support them.

	In the reflection and grievance, the peasants' awareness improved, and many problems of village cadres were also raised. One peasant said: "The village cadres have divided up more of the fruits of the struggle, eating and drinking lavishly in the village, and scaring the masses. Today, we must also liquidate him like we do the landlords." This speech aroused the peasants' hatred for some cadres. Everyone put forward opinions: some said to dismiss them and investigate them, some said to throw stones at them, and some said they must be beaten to death, scaring many cadres. At this time, the leadership induced everyone to think about who led the翻身 (fān shēn - to turn over, meaning to liberate) in our village. Can cadres be treated the same as landlords? Zhao Xiaoma said: "Cadres must not be treated the same as landlords. Village cadres led us to turn over. When we see the shortcomings of the cadres, we must also see their merits. We cannot erase their merits just because they have shortcomings." Zhao Jiujin said: "We must treat cadres separately. We must educate the cadres and transform their bad points." At this time, the cadres and the masses began to untie the knots with each other, and both sides made self-criticisms. One village cadre said: "I got more fruits in the movement, and I thought I had merit, so I had to be more special than the masses, and I had to speak louder than the masses. Eating and drinking lavishly was falling for the landlord's tricks. I was wrong. I didn't know that I was serving the masses, and I forgot my roots by separating myself from the masses. I will return the extra fruits and work wholeheartedly for the masses in the future, and I will fight the landlords severely when I go back." Zhang Dongcheng from Songyan said: "We should adopt a添油拨灯 (tiān yóu bō dēng - add oil and trim the lamp, meaning to help and support) policy towards cadres, not a摔灯 (shuāi dēng - smash the lamp, meaning to abandon) policy." The peasants of Dongguan said: "Cadres are our guiding lights. When the light is on, it is always bright. We must prevent the landlords from putting out the light, and if the light is put out, we will sneak through the cracks." Everyone's policy towards cadres was clear, and the cadres and the masses were in harmony.

	(6) Pull out the roots of poverty and plant the roots of wealth, organize and become rich.

	Does completely eliminating feudalism and getting land count as a thorough turn over and getting rich? After small group deliberation and discussion, everyone unanimously concluded: Turning over is liberation, thorough turning over depends on production, and after the roots of poverty are pulled out, the roots of wealth must be planted. At this time, the discussion also turned to daring to be rich and not daring to be rich. Some people still generally had the idea of "割韭菜 (gē jiǔ cài - cutting chives, meaning exploiting repeatedly)" and the idea of "eating the struggle meal" and being afraid of getting rich by struggling. They proposed Wu Manyou's direction for everyone to discuss. At the same time, the county's temporary measures for guaranteeing the lives and property of the laboring people were publicly read and explained, "No embezzlement, no exploitation, no bullying, and those who get rich by their own labor are not allowed to be struggled against and their interests infringed upon." "Those who divide up the fruits and sit and eat them without moving, and waste them all, will not be replenished." They solved the fear of being rich and clarified that they should unite to turn over, organize to unite to produce and get rich, and establish the idea of getting rich.

	After the universal training, more than 40,000 "Peasant University" graduates returned to the villages, and a new atmosphere appeared in the villages. The relationship between cadres and the masses improved and became more intimate. The masses and cadres twisted into one force, and launched a review movement against the landlords, checking the land and checking the classes. The work improved one step. Everywhere you hear that the "Peasant University" is well-run, learning skills, changing minds, and graduating with a brand new look.

	In addition to the above advantages, adopting the method of peasant training facilitates the rapid understanding and concentration of peasants' ideological demands and emotions; rapidly spreading among the peasants, it can discover more activists and cadres, extensively exchange experiences from various villages, learn from each other, and quickly form a movement; at the same time, it also solves the contradiction between the small number of county and district cadres and the large area, and the handicraft work method, enabling the masses to act piece by piece themselves, and launching a broad self-teaching and self-learning conscious unity movement.

　　和顺普训农民经验
    铁城　子唐
    和顺在发动老实农民团结中农，彻底消灭封建，完成土地改革的深入运动中，采取了领导与群众结合的农民大集训办法，进行一片片的农民轮流大普训，每个农民都进了一次“农民大学”。
    全县共普训四万余农民（包括农民、妇女全体村干部及积极分子与党员），五天一期。开始由区集中训练一期，从行政村抽调觉悟较高农民训练，以他们做为主力，深入各个基点村参加普训，县区干部亲身参加。
    集训方式，是大小会结合，进行座谈，有什说什，启发思想自觉；小组酝酿讨论，大会典型发言。集训中完全采用农民自己的语言、形式、内容、经验，教育自己，同时也教育了干部，开展了互教互学，自教自学的思想自觉运动。
    在大集训中，解决了农民那些思想，如何解决的呢？
    （一）劳动人民是土地的真主人。
    万物土中生，这个问题是一切问题的基础。解决的不彻底，农民就不能自觉的爱护果实，保卫果实，坚定树立主人翁观念。解决这个问题用了四个步骤：一、回忆历史，找寻农民穷、地主富的总根。从时事、季节（腊月，过大年等）座谈，引上反省诉苦。农民张和尚在会上哭诉着说：地主下光俺的地，卅年时没吃没喝，父亲气的眼瞎了，母亲姐姐和孩子都饿死了，俺黑夜盖的是烂麻包睡觉。接着赵小马说：我六十四岁啦，十四岁给地主住起长工，整整五十年，种地三十亩，每年能取十五石粮，地主坐着不动，就剥削了四百五十石，地主如何不富，咱为啥不穷。这时参加的农民自己都找到自己的穷根，觉悟到穷是被地主剥削的穷了，明确了剥削是穷富总根根，地主的财富都是咱穷人的血汗集成的。咱们穷就是被地主剥削干了的，于是大家就算起地主的剥削账。二区科举基点二百三十六人中，都被地主夺过地，过大年不敢在家，家被扫地出门的七十八人，受过地主打骂的一百十二人，被地主送住过监的二十九人，整整住过一辈长工的一百八十四人，打光棍的三十九人。一区二百二十个外来人中，家里被地主打死二十二人，饿死七十八人，讨吃过的一百廿人。在一面诉苦一面计算中，都痛哭流涕，启发了农民的阶级仇恨。二、接着提出那时为啥非受地主剥削不行呢？一个农民说：咱早上喝的是糠茶茶，晌午吃的是手拿拿（糠窝窝），晚上喝的是张飞赶他妈（青菜汤），连个豆荚南瓜吃不上，不租土地更不沾。大家吵着说：地主有土地，咱没活法，租地主地才有了活头，受剥削不由咱！这时大家清楚知道地主是依靠土地剥削农民的，但对谁靠谁活认识还不一致。三、随后提出地主土地从那里来？谁靠谁活？农民王连贵说：俺父亲住长工典下一座荒山坡，整整开垦了八年，修成四十亩好地，杜财主眼红了，把四十亩地给夺了。地主没刨过一＠头，他也不知道地在那里，万物土中生，不是咱，地主早就饿的死光了，咱们是地主的活财神，我就是土地的主人。农民从自己的历史追述中，认识到土地问题必须解决。并在思想上肯定了：土地是农民刨开的，农民就是土地的真主人，地主靠剥削农民过活几千年，地主的土地都是非法霸占农民的，地主是假主人。实行耕者有其田是土地回老家。
    （二）信自己团结，不信鬼神。
    讨论了农民是土地的真主人，土地应该归农民后，迷信思想仍侵占着，自然就发展到到底有无神鬼？一个农民说：“地主阶级用鬼神道门欺哄统治农民，说什么“吃斋行善积阴德”，“这辈多吃亏，来生享幸福”，“入了道门，就不让泄露，说：暴露道的秘密，浓血化身天打五雷轰。”我在过还香道，老早说了屁事没有。”民兵邢长胜说：俺在大庙开会时，把“奶奶爷”都打烂了，它没有能把俺怎。大家都回顾起各村打了大小神神，谁家都没遭灾受难，明确了鬼神是吓唬穷人的纸老虎。从讨论中群众自己结论：鬼神是地主统治人民的软办法，神都是泥捏纸画的，大家团结紧就是活神神。
    （三）农民在旧社会是奴隶在新社会是主人
    迷信落后思想解决后，随着就是社会自觉思想的提出。农民应当掌握印把子枪杆，保卫自己。这个问题的解决，经过两个步骤：一、土地既然是农民的，农民为啥不敢反抗呢？杜秀兰说：“旧社会衙门是地主的，印把子在地主手里，人家统有军队、监狱、法律，都是给穷人定下的，穷人不敢动，二指宽的条子一送，咱就得挨打坐监。人常说：“天下衙门向南开，有理无钱莫进来。”旧社会就没咱的发言权。从前科举村一个妇女从她地里拿回两穗玉茭，让地主看见了，硬说是偷他的，扣在村公所逼得上吊死了，男人去县里告状，判成是无赖，也给打死啦！两穗玉茭送掉两条人命，谁敢吭一声。”二、农民今天为啥能闹翻身？一个农民说：新社会农民成了掌柜，上有毛主席领导，区长县长都是咱自己人，为穷人作主。看看咱政府扣的，村上斗的那一个不是封建地主。农民兴奋的同声说：咱作了主人还不敢翻身怕啥，天下是咱农民的，咱们翻身做了主人，咱就要掌权、掌力，剪了树稍刨树根，斗倒小蒋还得除掉大老蒋。
    （四）只要农民团结斗争，天就永远不会变。
    这时又提出，我们既然成了社会的主人，为啥还有人不敢要斗争果实。王富保说：我就怕“天变”不敢斗争，分下果实不敢要。杜如兰说：天永远变不了，地主好比苦苦菜，农民好比锄一般，长的快，咱就锄的快，一锄两锄把根剜。八路军把日本鬼都打败啦，还怕蒋介石阎锡山，咱们在后方好好斗争地主砍树身，八路军在前线刨老根（打蒋介石），大家团结成一块铁，有毛主席领导，一定能打倒反动派，天永远也变不了。这个问题争论的最热烈。
    （五）干部擦黑，群众拥护。
    在反省诉苦中，农民觉悟提高了，同时也提出了不少村干部问题。一个农民说：村干部多分了斗争果实，在村里大吃大喝，唬吓群众，今天对他也得和地主一样做清算。这一发言，激起农民对若干干部的愤恨。大家都提出意见：有的说撤职查办，有的说石头对象，非打死不行，把许多干部都吓坏了。这时领导上诱导大家想想，咱们村里翻身是谁领导的。干部与地主能不能一样对待？赵小马说：干部与地主决不能一样对付，村干部领导咱们翻了身，看到干部的缺点，也得看到功劳，不能因有缺点，就把功劳也抹煞。赵九斤说：对待干部要分别开来，咱们要教育干部，改造他们的坏处。这时干部群众就进入了相互解疙瘩，双方检讨。一个村干部说：我在运动中多得了果实，认为我有功劳，就得比群众特殊，说话要强群众。大吃大喝，是上了地主当，我都错了，不知道自己是为群众服务的，脱离群众忘掉了本，我要把多得果实退出来，今后全心全意为群众干，回去狠狠斗倒地主。松烟张东成说：咱们对干部应该是添油拨灯政策，不能采取摔灯政策。东关农民说：干部是咱引路灯，灯在常常明，严防地主打熄灯，打熄了灯钻窟窿。大家对干部政策明确了，干部群众融洽一团。
    （六）拔了穷根栽富根，组织起来发家致富。
    彻底消灭封建得到土地算不算翻透身、发了财？经过小组酝酿讨论后，大家一致结论说：翻身是解放，翻透靠生产，穷根拔了还得栽富根。这时就又讨论到敢富不敢富，有些人普遍还存在了割韭菜思想，吃斗争饭，怕斗争不敢发财思想。提出吴满有方向大家讨论。同时当众宣读解释县里颁发的关于保障劳动人民生命财产暂行办法，“不贪污、不剥削、不恶霸，靠劳力发家的决不准斗争侵犯其利益”。“分得果实，坐吃不动，浪费光了，不再填补”。解决了怕富思想，明确了团结翻身，组机起来团结生产发财，树起发家思想。
    普训后，四万多“农民大学”毕业生返回村里，村里出现了一种新气象，干部群众关系改善亲切了，群众干部扭的一股劲，又向地主展开了复查运动，查田查阶级，工作提高一步。到处听得“农民大学”办的好，学本领，换脑筋，毕业出来一崭新。
    采取农民集训方式，除以上优点外，便于迅速了解集中农民思想要求情绪；在农民中迅速传播开来，能发现更多的积极分子与干部，广泛交流各村经验，互相学习，很快的形成运动；同时也解决了县区干部少地区大的矛盾，手工业工作方式，而使群众自己一片接一片的行动起来，开展了广大的自教自学的自觉团结运动。
