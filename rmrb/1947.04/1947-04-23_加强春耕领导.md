Short Commentary:

    This year's spring plowing and production have a better condition than any previous year: the vast number of peasants are cultivating their own land for the first time, and their production enthusiasm is unprecedentedly high. However, whether this enthusiasm can truly be transformed into powerful action depends critically on whether there is serious and in-depth leadership. This leadership, like the leadership in defeating feudalism, requires earnest attention from the county and district levels; however, the vast number of village-level cadres remain the main organizers and drivers.

    The cadres of Yuanqu Village in Shexian County have set an example in this work. They promoted and organized mutual aid, enlightened the masses' class consciousness and production consciousness, and led the masses in production, completing wheat weeding and hillside sowing within half a month. This exemplary action deserves to be greatly promoted. It is hoped that leaders in various regions will use the exemplary case of Yuanqu to educate and encourage village cadres to earnestly promote and organize labor mutual aid, lead the masses in production, and victoriously complete the urgent spring plowing task.

    In addition, the Yuanqu fact also gives us this enlightenment: the importance of respecting the merits of cadres. The reason why Yuanqu cadres can actively lead the masses in production is that they have undergone a self-conscious and self-taught unity movement of all cadres and the masses, unlike some places where, in resolving the relationship between cadres and the masses, the cadres were more or less hurt due to the simplicity of the work style or the insufficient recognition of the cadres' merits. In Yuanqu (see the news on this page on the 7th of this month), some cadres with shortcomings frankly washed their faces to the masses; and the masses also recognized the cadres' merits from recalling the history of their liberation, and decided to give the cadres ten years of leadership in the six major merits of resisting Japan, rent reduction, production, famine relief, resisting Chiang, and filling in the gaps. Therefore, the cadres and the masses achieved unity, which also encouraged the cadres' enthusiasm in leading the masses in production. This spirit should be paid attention to and applied to promoting mass movements and production and other tasks.

    加强春耕领导
    今年的春耕生产，有一个比过去任何一年都好的条件，广大农民第一次在自己的土地上耕作，生产热情空前高涨；但真正把这种热情形成有力的行动，决定关键是在于有否认真的深入的领导。这一领导，仍和领导打垮封建一样，除县区应切实注意外，广大的村级干部仍是主要的组织者与推动者。
    涉县原曲干部，在这一工作上做出了榜样。他们推动组织了互助，启发了群众的阶级自觉和生产自觉，带领群众进行生产，半月内完成了锄麦与坡地下种。这一模范行动值得大大推广，希各地领导上以原曲模范事例，教育与鼓励村干部同志，认真推动组织劳动互助，带领群众生产，胜利完成紧急的春耕任务。
    另外，从原曲事实，又给予我们这样一个启示：即尊重干部功劳的重要。原曲干部之所以能积极领导群众生产，是由于经过了全村干群自觉自教的团结运动，不是像有些地方那样，在解决干群关系中，由于工作方式的简单，或对干部功劳认识不足，多多少少刺伤了干部；而原曲（见本月七日本版消息）在这一运动中，一部分有缺点的干部坦率的向群众洗净了脸；而群众也由回忆翻身历史中，认识了干部功劳，决定给干部立十年来领导抗日、减租、生产、渡荒、抗蒋、填补六大功劳，因之，干群做到了团结，而又鼓舞了干部领导群众生产的热情。这一精神，应该被我们注意运用到推动群运与生产等各种工作中去。
