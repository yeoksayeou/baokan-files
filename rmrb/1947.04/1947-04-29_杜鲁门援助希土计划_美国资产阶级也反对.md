Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 25th. Comprehensive report: After nearly forty days of heated debate, the US Senate barely passed Truman's aid to Greece and Turkey plan on the 22nd with 67 votes to 23. On the same day before the plan was passed, the Senate rejected a motion and an amendment. The motion was "A final vote should be conducted after further study." (57 to 23 votes rejected). The amendment was "The aid plan should not include Turkey and military aid should not be given to Greece." (68 to 22 votes rejected). The number of senators who voted against the bill or supported the amendment was more than 20, which greatly exceeded the expectations of the American reactionaries. Among these people was a Democratic Senator, Harry Byrd, who voted against the Democratic government's foreign policy for the first time in his political career. Byrd appealed, "The United States should not violate the UN Charter and engage in unilateral action." Even more strange was Senator Wiley, the Republican congressional caucus supervisor, who bluntly called Truman's plan a "military adventure." Some senators voted against it purely from the interests of the bourgeoisie. For example, Democrat McKellar believed that "the US treasury is not inexhaustible." Therefore, he opposed the loan. Another example is O'Daniel, who believes that "it is futile to fight communism with money." Therefore, he also opposed the loan. These examples show that Truman's plan is not only detrimental to the broad masses of the American working people, but also detrimental to the American bourgeoisie. Who are the people who voted in favor? One of them is Taft, the chairman of the Republican Policy Committee and a giant in the Senate, who of course had to support Vandenberg. However, he "is not enthusiastic" about this "good thing". He had said earlier that "even participating in the vote is a reluctant act." Taft was definitely not the only person voting "reluctantly", there were many. Former UNRRA Director La Guardia had already said that some people would have to vote reluctantly, because otherwise, they would be in danger of being accused of being "communists." After Truman's plan was passed in the Senate, Democratic Senator Pepper told reporters: "The aid to Greece and Turkey plan is the biggest mistake in American foreign policy." He said he would propose that the United States "do its best to strengthen the United Nations and refrain from similar interventions in other countries from now on." The US House of Representatives will also vote on Truman's plan.

### 杜鲁门援助希土计划  美国资产阶级也反对

　　杜鲁门援助希土计划
    美国资产阶级也反对
    【新华社陕北二十五日电】综合报导：经过将近四十天的激辩，美参院于二十二日以六十七票对二十三票很勉强的通过了杜鲁门援助希土的计划。在通过这一计划之前的当天，参院否决了一个建议和一个修正案。建议是“应继续研究后，再进行最后表决。”（五十七对二十三票被否决）。修正案是“援助计划不应包括土耳其，反对给予希腊以军事援助。”（六十八对二十二票被否决）。不论反对本案的也好，赞成修正案的也好，投票的参议员都有二十余名之多，这就大大的出乎美国反动派意料之外。在这些人中间，有一个民主党的参议员哈利·拜德，在他的政治生涯中第一次的投票反对民主党政府拟定的外交政策。拜德呼吁说：“美国不应违反联合国宪章并从事单独行动。”更奇怪的是这些人中间还包括共和党国会党团的督导人参议员惠利，他把杜鲁门计划不客气的叫做“军事冒险”。某些参议员的投反对票，他们纯是从资产阶级的利益出发。例如民主党的麦克凯莱，他认为“美国财库并不是用之不竭的。”因此，他反对贷款。又如欧丹尼尔，他认为“用金钱与共产党作战是徒劳无益的。”因此他也反对贷款。这些例子说明了杜鲁门计划，不仅不利于美国广大劳动人民，而且也不利于美国资产阶级。投赞成票的是些什么人？其中一个是塔虎脱，塔是共和党政策委员会的主席，参院的巨头，他当然要支持攀登堡。但是，他对这件“好事”“并不感热烈”，他早说过：“即参加表决亦勉强为之。”“勉强”投票的人绝不只是一个塔虎脱，那是很多的。前联总署长瓜拉第亚已经说过，某些人必将勉强投票，因为不如此，他只有被人指摘为“共产党”的危险。杜鲁门计划在参院通过后，民主党参议员泼贝尔告记者称：“援助希土计划是美国外交政策中最大的错误。”他说他将提出建议，要求美国“尽力加强联合国，并自现在起不再对其他国家作类似之干涉。”美众院亦将表决杜鲁门的计划。
