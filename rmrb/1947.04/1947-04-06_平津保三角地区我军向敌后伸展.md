Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 3rd: In the Tianjin-Baoding-Pingjin triangular area, the people's strength is growing daily; the dream of the Chiang Kai-shek army in Tianjin to swallow and firmly control this area has been shattered. Currently, important towns and vast rural areas north of the Daqing River, such as Yongqing, Ba County, and Shengfang City, are still controlled by the People's Liberation Army. In the middle and latter parts of last month, more than 3,000 Chiang Kai-shek troops from the 12th Division in western Tianjin attempted to occupy Shengfang City and peeped west along the Daqing River. They were met with a tenacious counterattack from the heroic soldiers and civilians of the area, and after losing more than 200 men, they fled back to the suburbs of Tianjin in disarray. More than 3,000 Chiang Kai-shek troops from the 95th Brigade and part of the 4th Cavalry Division along the Pinghan Railway occupied the empty city of Rongcheng, 120 li northeast of Baoding, on the 10th of last month. They have since been buried in the flames of local people's guerrilla warfare and dare not move forward. The news broadcast by the Central News Agency that the Chiang Kai-shek army had occupied Xiong County is purely fabricated. Under the principle of "the enemy advances, we advance," the soldiers and civilians in the area have been fiercely extending towards the rear of the Chiang Kai-shek army, causing the Chiang Kai-shek troops who had previously invaded Xincheng, Gu'an, and Anci and other places to be attacked from all sides. In the middle and latter parts of last month, guerrilla corps in Anci and other places launched attacks on Langfang and Huangcun along the Beining Railway, as well as Panggezhuang, about 50 li south of Beiping, engaging in 11 fierce battles with the defending enemy, killing and capturing more than 150 Chiang Kai-shek soldiers and bandits. They once captured the Chiang Kai-shek stronghold in Huoxuanying, 3 li south of Panggezhuang.

Xinhua News Agency, Ji-Re-Liao, 3rd: Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops entrenched in the Longhua area of central Rehe have recently ordered "concentrated families and villages" to create uninhabited areas, using the cruel ruling methods of the former Japanese fascists and the puppet Manchukuo regime. In the past, the puppet Manchukuo regime stipulated that a "tribe" should be built for every 30 or 40 households, while the Chiang Kai-shek army now stipulates that a "tribe" should be built for every 500 households. The area is sparsely populated, and some land was already barren during the puppet Manchukuo era, with no inhabitants within 30 li. Now, there are no inhabitants within 100 li, and the land is extremely desolate.

　　平津保三角地区我军向敌后伸展
    【新华社晋察冀三日电】平津保三角地区，人民力量日益强大；平津蒋军吞食、确掌此一地区的梦想已告破灭。现大清河以北永清、霸县、胜芳市等重要城镇及广大乡村，仍为人民解放军所控制。上月中下两旬，津西蒋军第十二师三千余人企图侵占胜芳市，沿大清河西窥，遭该地英勇军民顽强反击，于损折二百余名后狼狈窜回津郊。平汉线蒋军九十五旅及骑四师一部共三千余人，上月十日侵占保定东北百二十里之容城一座空城后，即自埋于当地人民游击战争烽火中，不敢前进一步。中央社所播蒋军侵占雄县消息，纯系捏造。该地军民在“敌进我进”方针下，已向蒋后方猛烈伸展，使前侵陷新城、固安、安次等地蒋军四面受击。上月中下旬，安次等地游击兵团向北宁线廊房、黄村及北平以南约五十里之庞各庄等地进击，与守敌激战十一次，毙俘蒋军及匪特百五十余名，一度攻克庞各庄南三里之获宣营蒋军据点。
    【新华社冀热辽三日电】盘据热中隆化一带之蒋介石匪军顷下令“集家并村”、制造无人地区，沿用前日本法西斯及伪满的残酷统治办法。过去伪满规定每三、四十户人家修一“部落”，蒋军则规定每五百户修一“部落”。该地地广人稀，伪满时代已使若干土地荒芜，三十里内无人烟，现则百里之内已无人烟，土地荒芜不堪。
