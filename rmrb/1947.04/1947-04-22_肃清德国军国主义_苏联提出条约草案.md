Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 17th: TASS reports: In the meetings of the Special Committee under the Council of Foreign Ministers on the 14th and 15th, discussions were completed regarding instructions to the Allied Control Council concerning the elimination of German militarism and the democratization of Germany. On the 14th, the main discussion focused on the following two issues: First, regarding the free exchange of news and democratic ideas throughout Germany, the four representatives unanimously agreed that, except in cases that hinder "military security, the needs of the occupation, the fulfillment of Germany's obligations to the Allies, and the prevention of the revival of Nazism and militarism," the free exchange of news and democratic ideas is permitted throughout Germany. Second, regarding the basic human rights clauses in Germany's future constitution, the Soviet representative proposed that the constitution should include "basic democratic human rights cannot be used to harm Germany's fulfillment of its obligations to the Allies, or to attempt to revive Nazism and militarism in any form." The American and British representatives opposed this. The Special Committee instructed the drafting committee to record the differing opinions on this issue. On the 15th, the Special Committee decided to conclude its work and submit its report to the Council of Foreign Ministers.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 19th: TASS announced on the 15th the draft treaty proposed by the Soviet Union in the Council of Foreign Ministers on eliminating German militarism and preventing German aggression. The full text is as follows: On July 5, 1945, the governments of the United States, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and France declared their desire to completely disarm Germany and eliminate German militarism. The main part of this declaration has largely begun to be implemented. No matter can prevent or delay the completion of this work. It must be guaranteed that the disarmament of Germany and the elimination of German militarism proceed for as long as necessary, so that Germany can never again threaten its neighbors and world peace. It also requires as long as possible to achieve the goal of preventing German aggression. The work of preventing German aggression cannot be completed unless German militarism and Nazism are destroyed, unless the lives and national system of the German people are fundamentally transformed on a broad democratic basis to ensure that Germany becomes a freedom-loving country, and creates favorable conditions for European countries and the world to fully engage in peaceful endeavors. The completion of Germany's obligations to the Allies will allow the German people to occupy their proper place in the international community. To achieve this goal, the governments of the United States, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and France have reached an agreement to participate in the joint work stipulated in this treaty:

    German Military Strength Must Be Completely Destroyed

The above-mentioned institutions and any of their affiliated organizations shall not exist.

    The Ruhr Area Must Be Under Joint Control by the Four Powers; German Financial Oligarchs Must Be Eliminated

Article 3: In order to prevent the use of German industry for military purposes, the contracting parties agree:

    (a) To establish joint control by the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union in the Ruhr industrial area, which serves as the main base for German arms production and its main industrial fortress for military supplies, in order to achieve the following goals: to utilize the resources of the Ruhr to develop German peaceful industry and to meet the needs of European countries that have suffered damage from German aggression.
    (b) To completely eliminate German Konzerns, cartels, syndicates, trusts, and the financial oligarchs controlling the above organizations in the shortest possible time.
