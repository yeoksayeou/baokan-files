　　Qinghai Unit's Dujiazhuang First Company gloriously achieved the entrapment of the enemy
    [This report from the Yupei Frontlines] Our "Qinghai" Unit's Dujiazhuang First Company, in the Wangmen battle on the outskirts of Xinxiang, highly developed mutual aid group combat, creating a model example of mutual aid group operations. On April 5th, after our main force swept through various strongholds on the outskirts of Xinxiang, in order to expand the battle results northward, the "Qinghai" Unit remained in the area north of Chenbao and Lubao, independently blocking the enemy from Xinxiang, Hui, and Ji areas. The Dujiazhuang First Company was deployed around Wangmen and Dongzhangmen, with the task of dragging down the enemy and delaying their advance. This was an arduous task, as the depth from Wangmen to Dongzhangmen was seven or eight li long, and the width was also three or four li. This area was originally guarded by a regiment, but now it fell on the shoulders of their company. After receiving the mission, Company Commander Gao Fengrong called on the entire company to develop the role of mutual aid groups and the spirit of independent combat, learning from the example of the Zong Jincai mutual aid group (a model mutual aid group in the company) and creating more Zong Jincais. The entire company had eight groups. Platoon Leader He Yingjun led four groups, deployed in Dongzhangmen and Nanzhangmen, while the rest were directly commanded by the company commander and deployed in front of Wangmen Village. The battle started at dawn. Before the battle started, the company commander, in order to tell the enemy: "We are here, you cannot advance," led a small artillery squad and fired several shots at the enemy in Lubao. The enemy's force was about two battalions, equipped with two artillery pieces, and four aircraft continuously and frantically strafed, so the battle was very intense from the beginning. Wherever the aircraft flew low, circled, and strafed, the artillery fired one after another. Platoon Leader He was instructing Sun Qilong's group, fighting fiercely with the enemy, when a group of enemies迂回maneuvered around from behind them. But they were not flustered, withdrawing while resisting step by step, persisting for more than three hours. The four groups covered each other before retreating back to Wangmen. During the battle, because Platoon Leader He had planned carefully in advance and commanded flexibly, he went wherever a group was fighting fiercely. The group leaders were also exceptionally calm and firm, always cooperating well, without showing the slightest confusion. After the four groups retreated to Wangmen, all eight groups of the company concentrated their firepower on the forward positions of Wangmen Village and fired at the enemy. In this battle, we resisted the enemy for five hours with a small force, killing or wounding more than 20 enemies, causing the enemy to advance only ten more li in two days, while our casualties were extremely slight.

　　青海部杜家庄一连光荣达成牵制敌人
    【本报豫北前线讯】我“青海”部杜家庄一连，在新乡外围王门战斗中，高度发挥互助组作战，创造了互助组作战的模范战例。四月五日，我主力部队，于横扫新乡外围各据点后，为向北扩张战果，“青海”部便留在陈堡、鲁堡以北地区，独挡新、辉、汲等地之敌。杜家庄一连被分布在王门、东张门一带，任务是拖住敌人，迟滞敌人前进。这是一个艰巨的任务，因从王门到东张门，纵深有七八里地长，横宽面也足有三四里。这一地区，原先是由一个团来驻守的，现在却落在了他们一个连的肩膀上。一连长高凤荣领受了任务后，便号召全连发挥互助组的作用与独立作战精神，向宗进才互助组看齐（该连的一个模范互助组），创造更多的宗进才。全连共八个组，何英俊排长带四个组，布置在东张门、南张门，其余由连长直接指挥，布置在王门村前沿。战斗是天刚亮就开始的，战斗未开始前，连长为了告诉敌人：“我们在这里，你不能前进，”曾带领小炮班，向鲁堡敌人打了几炮。敌人的兵力，约有两个营，配有大炮两门，并有四架飞机，连续不断的疯狂扫射，因此战斗一开始即十分激烈。凡是飞机低飞盘旋与扫射的地方，大炮即纷纷射来，何排长指导着孙起龙组，正和敌人狠打，一股敌人却从他们后面迂回过来，但他们并不慌不忙，一面转移，一面节节抗击，一直坚持了三个多钟头，四个组互相掩护才退回王门。战斗中，由于何排长事前计划周密，指挥灵活，那组打的凶，他到那里，各组组长也异常沉着坚定，一直配合很好，没有现出丝毫紊乱。四个组退到王门后，全连八个组，又在王门村前沿阵地，集中火力，对敌射击。此役我以少数兵力，共抵抗敌人五个钟头，毙伤敌人二十多名，使敌人两天内只前进十多里，而我方伤亡却极轻微。
