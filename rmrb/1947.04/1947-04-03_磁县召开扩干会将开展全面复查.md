　　Cixian County Holds Expanded Cadre Meeting to Launch Comprehensive Review

　　[Report from our newspaper in Cixian] Cixian County convened an expanded cadre meeting on March 23 to mobilize for the review. In the land reform movement over the past year, the peasants of the county have recovered a total of 250,000 mu of land, more than 9,000 houses, more than 3,700 head of livestock, and more than 80,000 shi of grain from landlords, special agents, traitors, and local bullies, benefiting more than 135,500 people, accounting for 72 percent of the total population. Through this movement, the Communist Party and Chairman Mao have established unparalleled prestige among the masses. During the Lunar New Year, many liberated peasants tore down the Kitchen God and invited Chairman Mao to take his place. In Xue Liang's family in Shangchen Village, Third District, the shrine for Heaven and Earth was inscribed with "Long Live Chairman Mao, Long Live, Long Live," and every holiday, his old mother would burn incense and kowtow three times. Many liberated peasants said, "We believed in gods all our lives, but we weren't liberated. The Communist Party came and we were liberated in a year." Now the masses' awareness is unprecedentedly high. In the self-defense war of the past year, more than 6,000 liberated peasants in the county have joined the army. However, because the landlords are insidious and cunning, they spare no effort to preserve their feudal rule in various ways. For example, landlords in Yuecheng concealed more than 80 mu of land in the name of supporting, gifting, and fake sales; landlords in Suojing bribed cadres, pretended to be poor, and even wanted to share the fruits of the struggle. However, the next day, twelve large packages were seized from his home. In addition, there was the problem of some cadres being over-allocated and embezzling the fruits of the struggle. According to the inspection, there are still 40 poor households in Heilongdong who have not been eliminated, and the amount of "backward" elements in ideological mobilization is still very large. Even Shangchen Village still has 50 "backward" masses. In view of this situation, the county leading organs specially convened a county-wide expanded cadre meeting on March 23 to discuss and determine to continue to boldly mobilize the masses, thoroughly defeat the feudal rule, and realize land to the tiller; and pay attention to letting the masses rise up to reform the cadres and improve the relationship between cadres and the masses. The expanded cadre meeting ended on the 26th, and in-depth inspection movements in various districts are about to be widely launched. (Wang Zhounan)

　　磁县召开扩干会将开展全面复查
    【本报磁县讯】磁县于三月二十三日召开扩干会，动员复查。在一年来土地改革运动中，全县农民从地主特务汉奸恶霸手里共收回土地二十五万亩，房子九千余间，牲口三千七百余头，粮食八万余石，得利群众十三万五千五百余人，占全人口百分之七十二。经过这一运动，共产党毛主席在群众中建立了无上的威信，过旧历年时，许多翻身群众，扯下灶君爷，请上毛主席。三区上陈村雪亮家里的天地爷屋里，写着“毛主席万岁万万岁”，每过时节，他的老母亲就烧上炉香，进行三叩首。许多翻身群众说：“信了一辈子神，没有翻了身，共产党来了一年就翻身了”。现群众觉悟空前提高，在一年来自卫战争中，全县已有六千余翻身农民参军。但由于地主阴险狡滑，不惜用各种各样方式，保留他们的封建统治。如岳城地主用拥护、赠送、假卖等名义，隐蔽土地八十多亩；索井地主收买干部，假装哭穷，还想分斗争果实，但第二天即从他家斗出十二个大包袱，另外还有部分干部多分与贪污果实问题。据检查，黑龙洞还有四十户贫农没有消灭，在思想发动上“落后”层次量还很大。上陈村即尚有五十个“落后”群众。根据这一情况，县领导机关特于三月二十三号召开全县扩干会，讨论确定继续放手发动群众，彻底打垮封建统治，实现耕者有其田；并注意让群众起来改造干部，改善干群关系。现扩干会已于二十六号结束，各区深入检查运动即将普遍开展。（王周南）
