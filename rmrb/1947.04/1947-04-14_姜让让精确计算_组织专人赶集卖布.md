　　Jiang Rangrang Calculates Accurately
    Organizes Dedicated Personnel to Sell Cloth at Market
    [Our Newspaper, Zanhuang News] Before the establishment of the textile mutual aid group led by Jiang Rangrang (female) in Nantai Village, Gushan, Fifth District, they felt that going to the market to sell cloth and buy thread took too much time and hindered production, especially for women with bound feet who had difficulty walking. Therefore, each household contributed 5,000 yuan, forming a mutual aid group with a total share capital of 70,000 yuan from fourteen households. Jiang Rangrang was elected as the group leader, and cloth was woven on a household basis, absorbing twenty-one female laborers, with ten looms used in rotation. From the fourteen households, two loyal and reliable men, Guo Dali and Guo Diaodan, were selected to take turns going to the market to collectively sell cloth and collectively buy thread. The mutual aid group paid for the market-goers' lunches, and each man received 500 yuan per market trip. In this way, thirteen to fifteen workdays could be saved per market trip. Each worker could weave one and a half bolts of cloth per day (according to the usual weaving rate), totaling nineteen and a half bolts. With a wage of 500 yuan per bolt of cloth, 9,750 yuan could be earned per market trip. Based on three market trips every ten days, 117 workdays could be saved each month, earning wages of 87,500 yuan. To improve production enthusiasm and technique, those who weave defective cloth will have no less than 500 yuan deducted from their wages, while those who weave good cloth will receive a reward of 50 yuan per bolt. In addition, the two male laborers ensured that the female laborers had firewood to burn, without affecting their weaving, implementing labor exchange and mutual assistance. One hundred catties of firewood collected by a man were equivalent to a woman's wage of 500 yuan for weaving one bolt of cloth. From January 19th to February 20th, within thirty-one days, a total of 242 bolts of cloth were woven. After deducting 121,000 yuan for weaving wages and 13,000 yuan for market expenses, a net profit of 30,000 yuan (foreign currency) was earned. (Yuzhen, Dianqing)
