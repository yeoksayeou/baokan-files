　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, April 11th: The main force of Hu Zongnan's army, nine brigades in total, which had been rampaging through the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Liberated Area, began a hasty retreat southward on the 5th. Hu's troops reached Wayaobao on the 3rd, and on the 4th, they moved to Yujiawan, northeast of Washi. On the 5th, a small detachment was left in Washi, while the main force turned back south. On the 6th, part of our army intercepted them near Yongping, killing or wounding 600 enemies and capturing a battalion commander and over 100 soldiers. Currently, the main force of Hu's army is continuing its retreat back towards Yan'an, looking like stray dogs and fish escaping a net. Our army is in hot pursuit. A Xinhua News Agency reporter stated: Since Hu Zongnan's army began its incursion into the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Liberated Area on the 13th of last month, less than a month ago, their initial momentum was fierce, boasting that they would capture the great leading organs of the Chinese Communist Party and annihilate the main force of the Northwest People's Liberation Army. Their attack on Yan'an resulted in one futile attempt, their attack on An'sai resulted in two futile attempts, their attacks on Yanchang, Yanchuan, and Qingjian resulted in three futile attempts, and their attacks on the Wayaobao-Yongping line resulted in four futile attempts. Our People's Liberation Army annihilated 5,000 enemies in the defense war south of Yan'an, killing He Qi, the brigade commander of Hu's 48th Brigade; in the battle of Qinghuabian, 70 li northeast of Yan'an, we annihilated 4,000 enemies, capturing Li Jiyun, the brigade commander of Hu's 31st Brigade; in the Guanzhong area, we annihilated one battalion each from the New 1st Brigade and the 10th Division; and this time, we achieved victory in the interception at Yongping. In total, we have annihilated over 10,000 enemies. Since Hu's army intruded into the border area, they have had no rest, their food and supplies have reached a critical point, their forces are exhausted, and the number of deserters and stragglers has rapidly increased, causing morale to plummet. Furthermore, the people of the Liberated Area are implementing a scorched-earth policy, blocking news, and launching guerrilla warfare, causing Hu's army to encounter enemies everywhere like blind men, yet they do not know where our army is. Concentrated advances lead to futile attacks everywhere, while dispersed defenses lead to piecemeal annihilation. These insurmountable difficulties have placed Hu's army in a dangerous situation of certain defeat. This is the reason for Hu's army's panic and hasty retreat. Now, Hu's army's momentum has been exhausted, and they have fallen into a trap. The People's Liberation Army will surely achieve continuous victories.

　　陕甘宁歼敌已达万余
    胡军四次扑空气势衰竭南窜
    【新华社陕北十一日电】窜犯陕甘宁解放区之胡宗南军主力九个旅，五日起仓皇向南逃窜。胡军三日窜抵瓦窑堡后，四日窜至瓦市东北之玉家湾。五日留小部于瓦市，其主力即回头南窜。六日我军一部截击之于永坪附近，毙伤敌人六百，俘其营长一名、士兵百余。现胡军主力正继续向延安回窜，忙忙如丧家之狗，急急如漏网之鱼；我军正猛烈追击中。新华社记者称：胡军窜犯陕甘宁解放区，自上月十三日以来，未及一月，窜犯之初其势汹汹，扬言要捕捉伟大的中国共产党首脑机关及歼灭西北人民解放军主力。窜到延安一次扑空，窜到安塞二次扑空，窜到延长、延川、清涧三次扑空，窜到瓦窑堡、永坪之线四次扑空。我人民解放军于延安以南的保卫战中歼敌五千，击毙胡军四十八旅旅长何奇；于延安东北七十里之清化砭一战中歼敌四千，俘胡军三十一旅旅长李纪云；于关中地区歼敌新一旅及第十师各一个营；此次又在永坪截击获胜。以上共计歼敌万余。胡军窜入边区之后毫无休息，粮草困难达于极点，兵力疲惫，逃亡及掉队落伍者迅速增多，士气迅速下降。加以解放区人民坚壁清野、封锁消息、展开游击战争，胡军像瞎子一样到处碰到敌人，但又不知我军究在何方。集中前进则到处扑空，分散守备则被逐一歼灭。这些不可克服的困难，已使胡军处于必败的危险境地。这是胡军发生恐慌仓皇回窜的原因。现在胡军气势已经衰竭，并已陷到天罗地网中，人民解放军必将取得连续不断的胜利。
