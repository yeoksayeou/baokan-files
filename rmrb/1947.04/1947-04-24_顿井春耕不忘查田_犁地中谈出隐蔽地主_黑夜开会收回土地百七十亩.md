    Donjing Spring Plowing Does Not Forget to Investigate Fields
    Plowing Reveals Hidden Landlords
    Night Meeting Recovers 170 Mu of Land
    [This newspaper, Wu'an News] After the Fifth District's Donjing Village sent off the stretcher-bearers who participated in the war on April 5th, the village cadres held a meeting to discuss organizing a concentrated spring plowing effort and went door-to-door to spread the word that production this year was a major issue and could not be done well without good organization. After allowing the masses to deliberate, the agricultural association discussed organizing production the next night and immediately organized ten groups, starting by delivering manure and plowing fields for military families. In a casual conversation while plowing, Liu Shan's group heard Jia Tan say, "Have the landlords in our village been thoroughly overthrown? Li Rulin was struggled against, but his family of four or five people still has eleven mu of good land (near the village), half a courtyard, and he doesn't work, pretending to be poor, carrying a load to Wu'an city to sell persimmons, but he eats better every day than the peasants who have been liberated.” Everyone thought he hadn't been overthrown. Group leader Liu Shan came back and immediately discussed it with the village cadres. That night, the agricultural association launched a discussion, and by comparing living standards with the landlords, they found that fifteen landlord households had not been thoroughly overthrown. By investigating class status household by household, they uncovered three more hidden landlord households. Among them, Li Cunqing had three wives, had served as a Bao chief and head of the large community, and owned eighty mu of land. After the anti-Japanese government came, he divided his family among his brothers to avoid liquidation. This time, a total of one hundred and seventy-one mu of land, one hundred and forty rooms, two donkeys, one cow, and a large quantity of farm implements, clothing, and grain were uncovered. In this movement, the cadres' complacency was broken. The cadres said, "There are still some who haven't been thoroughly struggled against.” So they decided to investigate the fields and produce at the same time.

    顿井春耕不忘查田
    犁地中谈出隐蔽地主
    黑夜开会收回土地百七十亩
    【本报武安讯】五区顿井村犁地闲谈中查出大批土地。四月五号参战担架走后，该村干部开会讨论组织起来突击春耕，并分头挨户宣传，今年生产是大问题不组织好不行。让群众酝酿后，第二天晚上即在农会讨论组织生产，当即组织了十个小组，开始先给军属送粪犁地，刘善组在犁地闲谈中，贾谈说：“咱村地主是不是斗垮了？李如林被斗了，家里四五口人，留了十一亩好地（近地），半座院子，不做活，假装穷了，担着担子到武安城卖柿子，可是每天吃的比翻身户要好的多。”大家都认为就是没垮，组长刘善回来马上和村干部谈了一下，当晚农会展开讨论，从与地主比生活中查出地主十五户没斗垮。再按户查阶级，又查出三户隐蔽地主。其中李存清有三个老婆，当过保长和大社首，有八十亩地，抗日政府来以后，为了逃避清算，弟兄分家。这次共查出地一百七十一亩，房一百四十间，驴二头，牛一头，农具衣服粮食亦很多。在这一运动中，打破了干部自满思想，干部说：“还有没斗透的。”便决定一面查田，一面生产。（佩文、广富、秀惠、全有）
