Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 20th: Thousands of people from all circles of the Party, government, and military in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region gathered yesterday (the 18th) in a certain place in northern Shaanxi to celebrate the great victory of annihilating the 135th Brigade of Hu Zongnan's army south of Wayaobao. People from nearby villages within a radius of twenty-odd li also rushed to participate. The venue was plastered with red and green slogans such as "Everything for the victory of the front line," "Win more battles and capture Hu Zongnan alive," and "Thoroughly eliminate the enemies attacking the border region in the border region." Wang Weizhou, Deputy Commander of the Border Region Joint Defense Headquarters, pointed out at the meeting: The Yangmahe Victory, only twenty days after the Qinghuabian Victory, fully proves that we have a 120% certainty of annihilating Chiang Hu's army in the border region. The Hu army, which came fiercely, no longer dares to sneak around, and can only concentrate seven or eight brigades on the mountain, rolling around tremblingly. In one month, our army annihilated more than 20,000 of Hu's troops, and in the midst of the enemy concentrating seven or eight brigades and rolling around, we cut off a large piece in the middle and annihilated it, while the enemies within five li did not dare to reinforce them. This shows that the morale of the enemy has declined sharply in the past month, and it also shows the tactical brilliance and high morale of our Northwest People's Liberation Army. Deputy Commander Wang continued: Hu Zongnan is now in a dilemma, and our Tongpu Road People's Liberation Army has already destroyed Hu Zongnan's old nest in Shanxi, directly threatening the Hu army's rear. The net to destroy Hu Zongnan has already been cast, and our border region army and people will certainly not let Hu Zongnan escape from the border region. Cao Liru, Deputy Secretary-General of the CCP Northwest Central Bureau, pointed out that in the initial stage of the border region army and people suddenly transitioning from ten years of peace to wartime, there were indeed some difficulties, and there will still be some difficulties in the future, but in the past month, guerrilla warfare has been widely carried out everywhere, and the combination of various war mobilizations and production among the people has become increasingly close. Therefore, as long as we continue to fight hard, we will certainly be able to overcome difficulties, eliminate Hu Zongnan, and cut off the left arm of the traitor Chiang Kai-shek. The meeting unanimously resolved to write a letter to pay tribute to the commanders and fighters on the front line. As the meeting ended, news came that the Jinchaji People's Liberation Army had liberated the two cities of Jingxing and Huolu, and surrounded 3,000 Chiang's troops on the periphery of Shijiazhuang, and that the Jinjiluyu People's Liberation Army had annihilated the Second Rapid Column of Chiang's army northeast of Qixian. Immediately, the entire venue erupted in applause, and songs and laughter made the entire mountain field boil.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinjiluyu, 24th: Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu to all commanders and fighters of the Northwest People's Liberation Army: After annihilating the enemy in Qinghuabian, you have now achieved the brilliant victory of annihilating the entire 135th Brigade of Chiang Hu's army in Wayaobao, creating a turning point in the war situation. The news of the victory has come, and the whole army admires you. The Jinjiluyu People's Liberation Army is celebrating and cooperating with you with the victories on the two fronts of northern Henan and Tongpu, and is preparing to continue to fight even greater annihilation battles, until the attack of Chiang Kai-shek is crushed and the dictatorial and traitorous rule of Chiang Kai-shek is ended! All the soldiers of the Jinjiluyu People's Liberation Army. April 20th.

    瓦窑堡之捷造成战局转折点
    陕甘宁各界欢腾庆祝
    边区人民解放军电贺西北伟大胜利
    【新华社西北二十日电】陕甘宁边区党政军各界数千人，昨（十八日）于陕北某地集会，庆祝此次瓦窑堡以南歼灭胡军一三五旅之大捷。附近二十余里之群众亦赶来参加。会场周围遍贴“一切为着前线的胜利”，“多打胜仗活捉胡宗南”，“把进攻边区的敌人彻底消灭在边区”等红绿标语，边区联防司令部副司令员王维舟于会中指出：继青化砭胜利之后仅廿天的羊马河大捷，充分证明我们有十二分的把握把蒋胡军消灭在边区。来势凶凶之胡军，已不敢再行偷巧钻隙，只能集中七八个旅摆在山头上战战兢兢的滚来滚去。一个月中，我军消灭胡军二万多人，并且在敌人集结七八个旅滚动中，拦腰挖掉它一大块加以歼灭，而在五里以内之敌人都不敢增援。这就说明敌人在一月来其士气急剧低落，也说明我西北人民解放军战术之精明与士气之高涨。王副司令员继称：胡宗南现已进退为难，而我同蒲路人民解放军又已经捣毁胡宗南在山西的老巢，直接威胁胡军后路。胡宗南覆没的罗网已经张开了，我们边区军民一定不让胡宗南逃出边区。中共西北中央局曹副秘书长力如指出：边区军民在十年和平突转入战时的初期，确有若干困难，而且今后还遇到若干困难，但一月以来各地游击战已普遍开展，人民中各种战争动员与生产的结合亦已日趋紧密。因此只要我们再接再厉继续奋战下去，一定能克服困难，消灭胡宗南，斩断卖国贼蒋介石这支左臂。大会一致决议，写信向前线指战员致敬。当大会结束时，正传来晋察冀人民解放军解放井陉、获鹿两城，在石家庄外围包围蒋军三千，以及晋冀鲁豫人民解放军在淇县东北歼灭蒋军第二快速纵队等捷报，立时全场掌声雷动，歌声与欢笑，使整个山野沸腾起来。
    【新华社晋冀鲁豫二十四日电】毛主席、朱总司令转西北人民解放军全体指战员同志：你们继清化砭歼敌之后，今又在瓦窑堡取得歼灭蒋胡军一三五旅全部的光辉胜利，造成战局的转折点；捷电传来，全军敬佩；晋冀鲁豫人民解放军正以豫北、同蒲两前线胜利庆祝与配合你们，并准备继续打更大的歼灭战，一直到粉碎蒋介石的进攻，结束蒋介石独裁卖国统治！晋冀鲁豫人民解放军全体将士。四月二十日。
