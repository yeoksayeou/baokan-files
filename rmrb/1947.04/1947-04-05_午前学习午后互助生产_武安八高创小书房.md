　　Morning Study, Afternoon Mutual Aid Production
    Wu'an No. 8 High School Creates Small Study Rooms
    [Our News] In order to improve students' cultural quality, promote creativity, and launch a self-study movement, Wu'an No. 8 High School, based on student opinions and needs, created a "Merit Room," equipped with sections such as "Broadcasting," "Wall Newspaper," "Challenge," "Questions and Answers," and "Opinions." It established merit standards for faculty, students, and cooks, implemented a challenge system between individuals, groups, and classes, and regularly summarized experiences and creations, democratically selecting various models. Under the slogan "Show Your Skills in the Merit Room and Launch a Great Self-Study Movement," students enthusiastically joined the self-study wave. During this movement, Wei Fengqi, a student from Class A, led classmates in helping each other learn to read, recognizing 55 characters in one day, learning to read newspapers, and frequently acting as a "little teacher." During the military enlistment movement, he took the lead in volunteering, saying, "Defend the good times, youth go to the battlefield!" influencing ten classmates to volunteer for the army. Female students Wu Xiuzhen and Zhu Meiying not only taught themselves to compose clapper talks but also organized the North-South Shangbaishi Women's Small Factory, gaining the support of the masses. In addition, they created a small exhibition, with everyone proposing "Compare Achievements, Show Skills, and Make Contributions at the Exhibition." Every student's notes, diaries, new characters, clapper talk scripts, songbooks, tracing paper, etc., were exhibited in the "Merit Room." After this exhibition of current affairs learning achievements, the students' enthusiasm for learning soared to unprecedented heights, and they automatically formulated specific learning plans. Students in North-South Shangbaishi, because they lived far from the school and could not regularly attend, created small study rooms where they slept collectively, collectively went to school for study in the mornings, and collectively engaged in mutual aid production in the afternoons, discussing current affairs during production and still delivering letters while supporting resistance against Japan. For example, students Su Eryou and Wen Linhe from the North Shangbaishi small study room wrote their own small study room slogan: "Morning study, afternoon production, neither is delayed." Li Xinhe, a student from the South Shangbaishi small study room, also absorbed youth Zhang Xiangshan, militiamen Zhang Youting, and Li Cunshuan from outside the school to study in the small study room. Currently, the two small study rooms in the north and south have a total of twenty people, and everyone is highly motivated. (Chai Renping, Qin Shunru, Zhang Jingguo, Guo Rusheng)
    [Our News from Anyang] After land reform in Yingyang Village, Anyang, the masses urgently requested schools. Agricultural association cadres and activists first mobilized their own children to enroll, and then 90 children, both boys and girls, enrolled from the entire village. However, the masses lacked firewood, and asked children to gather firewood at home, so only 31 boys and 25 girls regularly attended school. The rest organized two mutual aid teams at home, and eight people were half-day students. Other children at home formed small groups of three or two, each with a literacy card, combining production and literacy at home. Teacher Liu Fuzhang, following the new principle of teaching what is needed, taught female students to spin cotton, studying for half a day and spinning for half a day. In the past, female children spun two taels of cotton a day at home, but now they can spin three and a half taels in half a day at school, and even the younger ones can spin two taels. Currently, the school has 20 spinning wheels. The teacher repairs the spinning wheels when they break, and the teacher also got a spinning wheel to spin cotton. The masses felt that they could learn to read and do work at school, so the number of students gradually increased, and the number of spinning wheels also increased day by day. Young women outside the school, seeing the female students at school learning to read and spinning cotton well, also asked the teacher to organize spinning groups and take literacy cards. They are now being organized to combine the spinning movement with learning, and Yingyang Elementary School is becoming increasingly large in this way.

　　午前学习午后互助生产
    武安八高创小书房
    【本报讯】武安八高为了提高学生文化质量，发扬创造性，展开自学运动，根据学生意见及需要，创造出“立功室”，设有“广播”、“壁报”、“挑战”、“问答”、“意见”等栏；订出教职员、学生、炊事员，立功标准，实行人与人、组与组、班与班挑战办法，并随时总结经验与创造，民主评选各种模范。在“立功室里显本领展开自学大运动”的口号下，学生们热火朝天的卷入自学浪潮。在这一运动中甲班学生魏凤岐领导同学互助学生字，一天内识到五十五个，学会看报，并经常当小先生。这次参军运动中，他带头自动报名，他说：“保卫好时光青年上战场！”影响十个同学都自动参了军。女生武秀珍、朱梅英，自学编快板外，并组织南北上白石妇女小工厂，得到群众拥护。另外创造了小型展览会，大家提出“比成绩显本领展览会要立功”，每个学生笔记日记生字快板歌本仿纸等，都在“立功室”里进行展览。经这次时事学习成绩展览后，学生们学习情绪空前高涨，自动订出具体学习计划。南北上白石学生，因离校远不能经常到校学习，他们便创造了小书房，集体睡觉，午前集体到校学习，午后集体互助生产，在生产中讨论时事，还不误优抗送信。如北上白石小书房学生苏二有、温林河等自编小书房标语：“午前学习午后生产两不耽误”。南上白石小书房学生李新河并吸收了校外青年张香山、民兵张有廷、李存拴等也到小书房学习。现在南北头两个小书房共人数二十名，大家劲头很大。（柴任平、秦顺如、张靖国、郭如升）
    【本报安阳讯】安阳应阳村经过了土地改革，群众迫切要求办学校，农会干部积极分子首先动员自己儿女入学，接着全村男女儿童入学的就有九十个。但群众烧柴缺，叫儿童在家打柴，经常到校的男生只有三十一个，女生只有廿五个，其余在家组织有两个互助组，八个人是半日生。另外在家的儿童是三三两两成一小组，每人都有识字牌，在家生产结合识字。教员刘辅章同志本着用啥教啥的新方针，教女儿童纺花，学习半天，纺半天花，过去女儿童在家一天纺二两花，现在学校半天能纺三两半，小的也能纺二两。现在学校有纺车二十辆，纺车坏了教员修理，教员也弄了一辆车子纺花。群众感到在学校能识字还能做活，所以学生逐渐增加，纺车也一天天多了，学生们在学校劲头很大。校外的青年妇女，见到在校的女生识字纺花好，也找先生要组织纺花组，领识字牌。现正组织起来，使纺花运动与学习结合开展，应阳小学就是这样愈办愈大了。
