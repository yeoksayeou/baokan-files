    武安解决干群关系步骤与经验（续完）
    吴云
    二、干部的怨气发泄，情绪逐渐转向积极，开始愿意接受群众意见，但还有如下三个顾虑：（一）怕丢人。总认为提意见是打击干部，接受错误是丢人。有损威信，以后还怎样工作。（二）怕坏分子钻空。干部说：“老实农民提意见咱接受，就是有些‘尖头’，扩大事实，公报私仇，我不接受，群众如果一时分不清好坏，听人家指挥，把咱拖打一顿，那有多冤枉，不知道的以为群众把咱恨成那样子。”（三）怕退果实。有的人总觉得退果实不合理，有的认为当时谁也不敢要，咱破了命买下的；有的认为果实咱都掏了钱的，咱又没白要；也有的人发急没啥给群众退；贪污多错误大的干部还怕群众算起老账，自己连老本赔进去也不够。
    解除上述顾虑的办法，首先应该启发干部为群众服务经常洗脸的责任自觉。四区用好坏对比方法，提出那一种人丢人？干部说：“有黑哄不了群众，南天门放大炮四海扬名”；“有黑不洗群众认不清是人是鬼，不敢接近咱，这才丢人。”八区提出当干部是为了啥？既然是为了群众，群众有圪瘩，干部的责任就是帮群众解，有意见不叫提，还不是叫群众给咱越走越远，群众敢给咱提意见，证明群众给咱走的近，这是当干部的光荣，缺点是心病包袱，洗了缺点才能更好为群众立功。三区提出群众给干部提意见是为了啥？既然群众是为咱好，咱为什怕人家提意见？“有话说给亲人，有饭送给饥人，群众给咱一条心，所以才给咱提意见。知错改错不算错，知错不改错中错。能高能低真君子，洗脸擦黑为自己。脸上有黑看不出皮白，缺点不洗看不清功劳。宰相肚里能走船，能接受意见才是好干部”。其次，关于坏分子钻空子的问题，一方面应承认这样多的人提意见，难免有坏分子钻空子。干部操这个心，有警惕性是对的；另方面应该使干部相信群众眼光明确能分好坏人。你为群众，群众为你，你对起群众，群众对起你；真金不怕火来炼，好干部不怕提意见。提意见是经过民主，解决问题也要经过民主，不是谁说啥就算啥，不正确的意见群众通不过。其次，还应该使干部了解，地主坏分子为啥能钻空子？就是因为咱们都有缺点，“落后”又没发动。干群之间有圪瘩，洗脸擦黑就是为了解圪瘩、补空子。不让群众提意见，自己有缺点不纠正，地主坏人就更容易利用“落后”打击咱们。因此“落后”不发动，不但封建挤不净，坏分子也澄不清，干部的翻身利益和名誉地位也不牢靠，干群团结才能消灭封建。填平补齐是为了巩固翻身利益，干部要起带头作用，自己洗了脸，才能叫群众洗脸，群众敢提意见才没意见；群众当了家，才能和地主分开家。这样就统一了先进和“落后”的要求，使干部在团结“落后”的自觉和巩固翻身利益的要求中积极起来。最后，关于退果实问题，领导上可以提出洗脸洗的净，群众对干部错误会原谅，不再过分过不去，以前的问题，群众自然会看情形处理；但领导上不应提出群众会原谅干部少退或不退果实，不应在发动干部洗脸，得群众原谅为目的，这会引起干部的错觉，为洗脸而洗脸。领导上应坚决引导干部达到自觉退出一切多得果实，因为这是干群团结重要基础。有的地区领导上常常在这点上产生动摇，以干部接受错误，干群圪瘩解开为满足，群众在过后一定不满意。打通干部自动退果实思想的重要方法，启发干部的历史自觉，从回忆历史比痛苦比地位回忆翻身当中，重新唤起干部的阶级感情，认识到没有群众拥护没有共产党领导，自己永翻不了身，也当不上干部；认识到过去自己也是穷人，今天翻了身就把穷弟兄忘了，这好比李闯王坐北京，得了江山忘穷人。过去同样受痛苦，今天应该有福同享，认识到果实是群众的血汗，多分果实就是窃取群众血汗，这是干部的羞耻；认识到没有群众那有自己的功劳，没有群众不用说多得果实，就连自己应得果实也要不回来。干部虽然出力大，过去咱就有力也没处出。认识到阶级翻身个人才能翻身，大家有时光自己的时光才能保得住，真正树立起阶级翻身的自觉，这样退果实才会做到自觉自愿。
    见面解圪瘩
    干部群众思想酝酿成熟即可见面解圪瘩，开一家人洗脸大会。步骤可让群众先提意见，然后领导上作批评，最后村干部作检讨。当群众提意见时，情绪是很激烈的，劲头很大，有的提意见变为诉苦痛哭，干部听了群众意见，有的是觉得没脸见人，低头不说话，有的是躺倒不动，一肚子气。群众中仍存在反干部斗干部的情绪，坏分子也趁机活动：打破头不怕扇，要换不了干部回去就没有咱们活的了。干部中不满和抵抗情绪也生长，个别坏干部也趁机煽动：啥也是咱的不对，反正没有咱过的了，收了谷子收大麻籽，收了大麻籽收南瓜，迟早饶不了斗争。两边都有人兴风作浪，这是全局最紧张的一段。要转变这个紧张局面，首先必须继续打通干部思想，给予安慰、给予鼓励，适当揭露个别坏干部的挑拨、破坏。如四区提出各人洗脸各人光，号召好干部带头洗脸。领导上则以身作则，首先检讨，这样大多数干部都陆续接受了群众意见，也就推动了不觉悟和觉悟慢的干部。
    当干部虚心接受了自己错误以后，群众的情绪马上就和缓下去了。这时领导上再启发群众讨论，干部为啥会有毛病？有毛病为啥富了干部？干部光毛病还有好处哩？咱提的意见是不是光怨干部的过？这样群众就自然会联想干部过去斗争如何坚决，就会想到干部还有不少好处。例如大屯妇女说：“咱今天翻了半个身，这就是干部的功劳，总比没翻身强。”东同乐群众说：“作工作谁还能没个错，叫咱当干都恐怕还不胜人家；一只手拍不响，不能光怨干部，咱说干部住好房子，那时候叫咱住咱还不敢住哩！”群众的观点开始转变，这时领导上再提出干部是谁的人？干部有错应该怎么办？群众就自然会认识到干部群众一家人，不能起斗争。提意见是为了纠正错误，只要干部真正认错改过就行。斗争干部是垮自己的台，是自己泼熄引路灯。群众树立起爱护干部和干群一家的自觉以后，弯子转过来了，坏分子的阴谋不攻即自破。
    干群圪瘩解开，领导上应趁热号召干部自动退出一切多得果实，启发群众向干部表功记功，检讨自己的落后面，帮助干群之间解决各种具体问题，这样一来，干部完全放了心，情绪就高涨起来。最后可以来一个干群互相表功，在互相表功基础上，号召开展团结立功运动。
    团结大会
    团结大会的目的，在于给干部群众一个总结起来的教育，并为开展下一个运动（复查），作下思想动员。团结会的主要内容：（一）说心思。用回忆洗脸的办法，启发大家说心思话。例如西同乐贫农张向元说：开始上级叫提干部意见，我以为是斗争干部，我对村长不满，就随着郭金太跑，他叫我活动大家换村长、政治主任，下他们的枪，这几天我才想通，村长、政治主任还是好处多，当干部不容易，换干部也不简单，不然谁有个缺点就斗争，谁还当干部，这样就把坏分子最后蹬展清。西同乐村长也说了心思，开始怎样不满意群众提意见，害怕群众斗争，号召村上民兵杀猪大吃大喝；现在才放了心，真正认识到洗脸的好处，咱为群众，群众为咱，洗了脸群众更加拥护干部了。说心思以后，干部即提出今后保证不记仇、不报复，不悲观、不泄气，要为群众服务，要经常洗脸，要帮助穷弟兄翻透身。群众也提出今后保证要尊重干部领导，要和干部一条心，有话要说在当面，使干群团结在一定制度上。（二）比进步。干部和群众在觉悟的基础上，开展了比进步运动，群众说咱没翻身怨咱落后，以后一定要进步，干部也说我有时候怕得罪人，斗争不积极。干部和群众都检查了自己的落后思想，提出要进步就得去掉落后，要和地主彻底分家，不给地主当尾巴。有些群众当场就把包庇地主的东西自报出来，比进步结合了发动“落后”挖“防空洞”运动。（三）团结复查。各村进行了大检查运动，检查中普遍发现三不彻底：（１）斗争地主不彻底。如城关区在这次斗争中发现地主隐瞒水地二百零五亩，旱地七百八十亩。（２）填平不彻底。最好的村南冯昌，也发现果实分配不公，许多贫农分到的都是坏地。（３）“落后”发动不彻底。继城是工作较好的村镇，竟发现还有六百廿五人不参加开会；和村一次运动即有一百九十七户自报给地主放东西。这样自满情绪被克服了，干部和群众的眼睛更明亮起来，大家更深刻体会到“农民不齐心，地主不死心，干群不团结，封建难消灭，落后不发动，封建挤不净，消灭封建真不容易”。
    各村就在这个基础上重新调整领导机构，大量吸收了这次运动中的贫农新积极分子，组成数量强大的包容新老积极分子的领导集团——复查委员会，在“天下农民大团结消灭封建大翻身”的口号下，开展了大规模的深入复查和填平补齐运动。

    II. Cadres aired their grievances, and their emotions gradually turned positive, and they began to be willing to accept the opinions of the masses, but they still had the following three concerns: (1) Fear of losing face. They always believed that criticizing them was attacking cadres and admitting mistakes was a loss of face. It would damage their prestige, and how could they work in the future. (2) Fear of bad elements taking advantage. Cadres said: "We accept the opinions of honest peasants, but there are some 'sharp ones' who exaggerate facts and take revenge. I don't accept this. If the masses can't distinguish between good and bad for a while, listen to their command, and drag us out and beat us up, it would be so unjust. Those who don't know will think the masses hate us that much." (3) Fear of returning the spoils. Some people always feel that returning the spoils is unreasonable. Some think that no one dared to ask for them at the time, and they bought them with their lives; others think that they paid for the spoils, and they didn't get them for nothing; some people are anxious because they have nothing to return to the masses; cadres who are corrupt and have made serious mistakes are also afraid that the masses will settle old scores, and even losing their principal will not be enough.
    The way to dispel the above concerns is to first enlighten the cadres on their responsibility to serve the masses and wash their faces frequently. The Fourth District used a good-bad comparison method and asked, "Which kind of person loses face?" The cadres said, "Those who are dark cannot deceive the masses. Firing cannons at Nantianmen will make them famous all over the world"; "If they don't wash their faces, the masses won't be able to tell whether they are human or ghosts, and they won't dare to approach us. That's what loses face." The Eighth District asked, "What are you doing as a cadre for?" Since it is for the masses, and the masses have knots in their hearts, the responsibility of the cadres is to help the masses untie them. If opinions are not allowed to be raised, isn't that just pushing the masses further and further away from us? If the masses dare to give us opinions, it proves that the masses are close to us. This is the glory of being a cadre. Shortcomings are burdens on the mind. Washing away shortcomings can better enable us to perform meritorious service for the masses. The Third District asked, "Why do the masses give cadres opinions?" Since the masses are doing it for our own good, why are we afraid of others giving us opinions? "If you have something to say, tell your loved ones, and if you have food, give it to the hungry. The masses are of one heart with us, so they give us opinions. It is not wrong to know and correct mistakes, but it is wrong to know mistakes and not correct them. A true gentleman can rise and fall. Washing your face and wiping away the dirt is for your own good. If there is dirt on your face, you can't see the white skin. If you don't wash away your shortcomings, you can't see your merits. A prime minister's belly can sail a boat, and being able to accept opinions is a good cadre." Secondly, regarding the issue of bad elements taking advantage of loopholes, on the one hand, it should be admitted that with so many people expressing opinions, it is inevitable that bad elements will take advantage of loopholes. It is right for cadres to worry about this and be vigilant; on the other hand, cadres should be made to believe that the masses have clear vision and can distinguish between good and bad people. If you are for the masses, the masses are for you. If you are worthy of the masses, the masses are worthy of you; true gold is not afraid of fire, and good cadres are not afraid of opinions. Giving opinions is done through democracy, and solving problems must also be done through democracy. It is not that whatever anyone says counts, and incorrect opinions will not be approved by the masses. Secondly, cadres should also understand why landlords and bad elements can take advantage of loopholes? It is because we all have shortcomings, and we are "backward" and have not been mobilized. There are knots between cadres and the masses, and washing our faces is to untie the knots and fill the gaps. If we don't allow the masses to express opinions and don't correct our own shortcomings, it will be easier for landlords and bad people to use "backwardness" to attack us. Therefore, if "backwardness" is not mobilized, not only will feudalism not be squeezed out, but bad elements will not be cleared up, and the cadres' interests in turning over, their reputation, and their status will not be secure. Only by uniting the cadres and the masses can feudalism be eliminated. Leveling and filling gaps are to consolidate the interests of turning over. Cadres must take the lead. Only by washing their own faces can they call on the masses to wash their faces. Only when the masses dare to give opinions will there be no opinions; only when the masses are in charge can they separate from the landlords. This unifies the requirements of the advanced and the "backward," and enables cadres to become active in the consciousness of uniting the "backward" and consolidating the interests of turning over. Finally, regarding the issue of returning the spoils, the leadership can propose that if the face is washed clean, the masses will forgive the cadres' mistakes, and will no longer be overly critical. The masses will naturally handle the previous problems according to the situation; but the leadership should not propose that the masses will forgive the cadres for returning less or not returning the spoils, and should not mobilize the cadres to wash their faces for the purpose of gaining the forgiveness of the masses. This will cause the cadres to have the illusion of washing their faces for the sake of washing their faces. The leadership should resolutely guide the cadres to consciously withdraw all the extra spoils, because this is an important foundation for the unity of cadres and the masses. The leadership in some areas often wavers on this point, being satisfied with the cadres accepting their mistakes and the knots between the cadres and the masses being untied, but the masses will definitely be dissatisfied afterwards. An important method to open up the cadres' minds to automatically return the spoils is to enlighten the cadres' historical consciousness, rekindle the cadres' class feelings by recalling history, comparing suffering, comparing status, and recalling turning over, recognizing that without the support of the masses and without the leadership of the Communist Party, they would never be able to turn over and become cadres; recognizing that they were also poor people in the past, and forgetting their poor brothers after turning over today is like Li Chuangwang sitting in Beijing, gaining the country and forgetting the poor. Having suffered the same pain in the past, they should share the blessings today, recognizing that the spoils are the blood and sweat of the masses, and dividing more spoils is stealing the blood and sweat of the masses, which is the shame of the cadres; recognizing that without the masses, there would be no merit of their own, and without the masses, let alone getting more spoils, even their own due spoils would not be recovered. Although the cadres have contributed a lot, they had no place to contribute their strength in the past. Recognizing that only when the class turns over can the individual turn over, and only when everyone has time can one's own time be guaranteed, and truly establishing the consciousness of class turning over, will returning the spoils be done consciously and voluntarily.
    Meet to Untie Knots
    When the cadres and the masses have matured their ideas, they can meet to untie the knots and hold a "family washing face meeting." The steps can be to let the masses express their opinions first, then the leadership makes criticisms, and finally the village cadres make self-criticisms. When the masses express their opinions, their emotions are very intense and they are very energetic. Some expressing opinions turns into complaining and crying. When the cadres hear the opinions of the masses, some feel ashamed to see people and lower their heads and don't speak, while others lie down and don't move, full of anger. There is still an anti-cadre and struggle-cadre sentiment among the masses, and bad elements also take the opportunity to stir up trouble: "I'm not afraid of being slapped even if my head is broken. If I can't replace the cadres, we won't be able to survive when we go back." Dissatisfaction and resistance are also growing among the cadres, and some bad cadres also take the opportunity to incite: "Everything is our fault anyway, and we can't survive anyway. After harvesting the grain, we harvest the hemp seeds, and after harvesting the hemp seeds, we harvest the pumpkins. Sooner or later, we will not be spared from struggle." People on both sides are making waves, which is the most tense stage of the whole situation. To change this tense situation, it is first necessary to continue to open up the minds of the cadres, give them comfort and encouragement, and appropriately expose the provocations and sabotage of individual bad cadres. For example, the Fourth District proposed that "everyone washes their own face and everyone shines," calling on good cadres to take the lead in washing their faces. The leadership sets an example by first making self-criticisms, so that most cadres gradually accept the opinions of the masses, which also promotes the unawakened and slow-to-awaken cadres.
    When the cadres humbly accept their mistakes, the emotions of the masses immediately ease. At this time, the leadership further encourages the masses to discuss, "Why do cadres have problems? Why do cadres become rich when they have problems? Are cadres only bad, or do they have any good points? Are the opinions we are giving only complaining about the cadres' faults?" In this way, the masses will naturally associate with how resolutely the cadres fought in the past, and they will think that the cadres still have many good points. For example, women in Datun said: "We have turned over half our bodies today, which is the credit of the cadres. It's better than not turning over at all." The masses in Dongtongle said: "Who can avoid making mistakes in their work? If we were to be cadres, we might not be better than them. You can't clap with one hand, so you can't just blame the cadres. We say that the cadres live in good houses, but we wouldn't dare to live in them at that time!" The views of the masses began to change. At this time, the leadership further asked, "Who are the cadres people? What should be done if the cadres make mistakes?" The masses will naturally realize that the cadres and the masses are one family and cannot start a struggle. Giving opinions is to correct mistakes, as long as the cadres truly admit their mistakes and correct them. Struggling against the cadres is undermining our own stage and extinguishing our guiding lights. After the masses have established the awareness of cherishing the cadres and the cadres and masses being one family, the situation turns around, and the conspiracy of the bad elements is defeated without being attacked.
    Once the knots between the cadres and the masses are untied, the leadership should take the opportunity to call on the cadres to automatically withdraw all the extra spoils, encourage the masses to praise and give credit to the cadres, review their own backwardness, and help the cadres and the masses solve various specific problems. In this way, the cadres are completely relieved and their morale is boosted. Finally, there can be a mutual commendation of cadres and the masses, and on the basis of mutual commendation, a campaign to unite and perform meritorious service can be launched.
    Unity Conference
    The purpose of the unity conference is to give the cadres and the masses a summarized education and to make ideological mobilization for the next campaign (re-examination). The main content of the unity conference: (1) Speak your mind. Use the method of recalling washing your face to encourage everyone to speak their minds. For example, Zhang Xiangyuan, a poor peasant in Xitongle, said: "At first, when the superiors asked us to give opinions on the cadres, I thought it was to struggle against the cadres. I was dissatisfied with the village chief, so I followed Guo Jintai. He asked me to mobilize everyone to replace the village chief and political director and take away their guns. These days, I have realized that the village chief and political director are still good. It is not easy to be a cadre, and it is not easy to replace a cadre. Otherwise, if someone has a shortcoming, they will be struggled against. Who would want to be a cadre? This is how the bad elements were finally exposed." The village chief of Xitongle also spoke his mind, saying how he was dissatisfied with the masses' opinions at the beginning, afraid of the masses' struggle, and called on the village militia to slaughter pigs and eat and drink heavily; now he is relieved and truly realizes the benefits of washing his face. We are for the masses, and the masses are for us. After washing our faces, the masses support the cadres even more. After speaking their minds, the cadres then proposed that they would guarantee not to hold grudges or retaliate, not to be pessimistic or discouraged, to serve the masses, to wash their faces frequently, and to help the poor brothers completely turn over. The masses also proposed that they would guarantee to respect the leadership of the cadres, to be of one heart with the cadres, to say what they have to say face to face, so that the unity of the cadres and the masses is based on a certain system. (2) Compare progress. On the basis of awareness, the cadres and the masses launched a "compare progress" campaign. The masses said that if we have not turned over, it is because we are backward. We must make progress in the future. The cadres also said that they are sometimes afraid of offending people and are not active in the struggle. The cadres and the masses all examined their backward thinking and proposed that to make progress, they must get rid of backwardness, completely separate from the landlords, and not be the landlords' tails. Some masses confessed on the spot that they were protecting the landlords. The "compare progress" was combined with the campaign to mobilize the "backward" to dig "air-raid shelters." (3) United Re-examination. The villages carried out a major inspection campaign. The inspection generally found three incomplete aspects: (1) The struggle against the landlords was incomplete. For example, Cheng Guan District found that the landlords had concealed 205 mu of irrigated land and 780 mu of dry land in this struggle. (2) Leveling was incomplete. Nan Fengchang, the best village, also found that the distribution of spoils was unfair, and many poor peasants were allocated bad land. (3) The mobilization of the "backward" was incomplete. Jicheng, a relatively good village and town, found that 625 people did not participate in the meeting; and in a single campaign, 197 households reported that they had placed things with the landlords. In this way, complacency was overcome, and the eyes of the cadres and the masses became brighter. Everyone deeply realized that "if the peasants are not united, the landlords will not die. If the cadres and the masses are not united, feudalism will be difficult to eliminate. If the backward are not mobilized, feudalism will not be squeezed out. Eliminating feudalism is not easy."
    On this basis, the villages reorganized their leadership structures, massively absorbed new activists from the poor peasants in this campaign, and formed a powerful leading group composed of new and old activists—the Re-examination Committee. Under the slogan of "The Great Unity of Farmers in the World Eliminates Feudalism and Achieves a Great Turnover," a large-scale in-depth re-examination and leveling campaign was launched.

    武安解决干群关系步骤与经验（续完）

    二、干部的怨气发泄，情绪逐渐转向积极，开始愿意接受群众意见，但还有如下三个顾虑：（一）怕丢人。总认为提意见是打击干部，接受错误是丢人。有损威信，以后还怎样工作。（二）怕坏分子钻空。干部说：“老实农民提意见咱接受，就是有些‘尖头’，扩大事实，公报私仇，我不接受，群众如果一时分不清好坏，听人家指挥，把咱拖打一顿，那有多冤枉，不知道的以为群众把咱恨成那样子。”（三）怕退果实。有的人总觉得退果实不合理，有的认为当时谁也不敢要，咱破了命买下的；有的认为果实咱都掏了钱的，咱又没白要；也有的人发急没啥给群众退；贪污多错误大的干部还怕群众算起老账，自己连老本赔进去也不够。
    解除上述顾虑的办法，首先应该启发干部为群众服务经常洗脸的责任自觉。四区用好坏对比方法，提出那一种人丢人？干部说：“有黑哄不了群众，南天门放大炮四海扬名”；“有黑不洗群众认不清是人是鬼，不敢接近咱，这才丢人。”八区提出当干部是为了啥？既然是为了群众，群众有圪瘩，干部的责任就是帮群众解，有意见不叫提，还不是叫群众给咱越走越远，群众敢给咱提意见，证明群众给咱走的近，这是当干部的光荣，缺点是心病包袱，洗了缺点才能更好为群众立功。三区提出群众给干部提意见是为了啥？既然群众是为咱好，咱为什怕人家提意见？“有话说给亲人，有饭送给饥人，群众给咱一条心，所以才给咱提意见。知错改错不算错，知错不改错中错。能高能低真君子，洗脸擦黑为自己。脸上有黑看不出皮白，缺点不洗看不清功劳。宰相肚里能走船，能接受意见才是好干部”。其次，关于坏分子钻空子的问题，一方面应承认这样多的人提意见，难免有坏分子钻空子。干部操这个心，有警惕性是对的；另方面应该使干部相信群众眼光明确能分好坏人。你为群众，群众为你，你对起群众，群众对起你；真金不怕火来炼，好干部不怕提意见。提意见是经过民主，解决问题也要经过民主，不是谁说啥就算啥，不正确的意见群众通不过。其次，还应该使干部了解，地主坏分子为啥能钻空子？就是因为咱们都有缺点，“落后”又没发动。干群之间有圪瘩，洗脸擦黑就是为了解圪瘩、补空子。不让群众提意见，自己有缺点不纠正，地主坏人就更容易利用“落后”打击咱们。因此“落后”不发动，不但封建挤不净，坏分子也澄不清，干部的翻身利益和名誉地位也不牢靠，干群团结才能消灭封建。填平补齐是为了巩固翻身利益，干部要起带头作用，自己洗了脸，才能叫群众洗脸，群众敢提意见才没意见；群众当了家，才能和地主分开家。这样就统一了先进和“落后”的要求，使干部在团结“落后”的自觉和巩固翻身利益的要求中积极起来。最后，关于退果实问题，领导上可以提出洗脸洗的净，群众对干部错误会原谅，不再过分过不去，以前的问题，群众自然会看情形处理；但领导上不应提出群众会原谅干部少退或不退果实，不应在发动干部洗脸，得群众原谅为目的，这会引起干部的错觉，为洗脸而洗脸。领导上应坚决引导干部达到自觉退出一切多得果实，因为这是干群团结重要基础。有的地区领导上常常在这点上产生动摇，以干部接受错误，干群圪瘩解开为满足，群众在过后一定不满意。打通干部自动退果实思想的重要方法，启发干部的历史自觉，从回忆历史比痛苦比地位回忆翻身当中，重新唤起干部的阶级感情，认识到没有群众拥护没有共产党领导，自己永翻不了身，也当不上干部；认识到过去自己也是穷人，今天翻了身就把穷弟兄忘了，这好比李闯王坐北京，得了江山忘穷人。过去同样受痛苦，今天应该有福同享，认识到果实是群众的血汗，多分果实就是窃取群众血汗，这是干部的羞耻；认识到没有群众那有自己的功劳，没有群众不用说多得果实，就连自己应得果实也要不回来。干部虽然出力大，过去咱就有力也没处出。认识到阶级翻身个人才能翻身，大家有时光自己的时光才能保得住，真正树立起阶级翻身的自觉，这样退果实才会做到自觉自愿。
    见面解圪瘩
    干部群众思想酝酿成熟即可见面解圪瘩，开一家人洗脸大会。步骤可让群众先提意见，然后领导上作批评，最后村干部作检讨。当群众提意见时，情绪是很激烈的，劲头很大，有的提意见变为诉苦痛哭，干部听了群众意见，有的是觉得没脸见人，低头不说话，有的是躺倒不动，一肚子气。群众中仍存在反干部斗干部的情绪，坏分子也趁机活动：打破头不怕扇，要换不了干部回去就没有咱们活的了。干部中不满和抵抗情绪也生长，个别坏干部也趁机煽动：啥也是咱的不对，反正没有咱过的了，收了谷子收大麻籽，收了大麻籽收南瓜，迟早饶不了斗争。两边都有人兴风作浪，这是全局最紧张的一段。要转变这个紧张局面，首先必须继续打通干部思想，给予安慰、给予鼓励，适当揭露个别坏干部的挑拨、破坏。如四区提出各人洗脸各人光，号召好干部带头洗脸。领导上则以身作则，首先检讨，这样大多数干部都陆续接受了群众意见，也就推动了不觉悟和觉悟慢的干部。
    当干部虚心接受了自己错误以后，群众的情绪马上就和缓下去了。这时领导上再启发群众讨论，干部为啥会有毛病？有毛病为啥富了干部？干部光毛病还有好处哩？咱提的意见是不是光怨干部的过？这样群众就自然会联想干部过去斗争如何坚决，就会想到干部还有不少好处。例如大屯妇女说：“咱今天翻了半个身，这就是干部的功劳，总比没翻身强。”东同乐群众说：“作工作谁还能没个错，叫咱当干都恐怕还不胜人家；一只手拍不响，不能光怨干部，咱说干部住好房子，那时候叫咱住咱还不敢住哩！”群众的观点开始转变，这时领导上再提出干部是谁的人？干部有错应该怎么办？群众就自然会认识到干部群众一家人，不能起斗争。提意见是为了纠正错误，只要干部真正认错改过就行。斗争干部是垮自己的台，是自己泼熄引路灯。群众树立起爱护干部和干群一家的自觉以后，弯子转过来了，坏分子的阴谋不攻即自破。
    干群圪瘩解开，领导上应趁热号召干部自动退出一切多得果实，启发群众向干部表功记功，检讨自己的落后面，帮助干群之间解决各种具体问题，这样一来，干部完全放了心，情绪就高涨起来。最后可以来一个干群互相表功，在互相表功基础上，号召开展团结立功运动。
    团结大会
    团结大会的目的，在于给干部群众一个总结起来的教育，并为开展下一个运动（复查），作下思想动员。团结会的主要内容：（一）说心思。用回忆洗脸的办法，启发大家说心思话。例如西同乐贫农张向元说：开始上级叫提干部意见，我以为是斗争干部，我对村长不满，就随着郭金太跑，他叫我活动大家换村长、政治主任，下他们的枪，这几天我才想通，村长、政治主任还是好处多，当干部不容易，换干部也不简单，不然谁有个缺点就斗争，谁还当干部，这样就把坏分子最后蹬展清。西同乐村长也说了心思，开始怎样不满意群众提意见，害怕群众斗争，号召村上民兵杀猪大吃大喝；现在才放了心，真正认识到洗脸的好处，咱为群众，群众为咱，洗了脸群众更加拥护干部了。说心思以后，干部即提出今后保证不记仇、不报复，不悲观、不泄气，要为群众服务，要经常洗脸，要帮助穷弟兄翻透身。群众也提出今后保证要尊重干部领导，要和干部一条心，有话要说在当面，使干群团结在一定制度上。（二）比进步。干部和群众在觉悟的基础上，开展了比进步运动，群众说咱没翻身怨咱落后，以后一定要进步，干部也说我有时候怕得罪人，斗争不积极。干部和群众都检查了自己的落后思想，提出要进步就得去掉落后，要和地主彻底分家，不给地主当尾巴。有些群众当场就把包庇地主的东西自报出来，比进步结合了发动“落后”挖“防空洞”运动。（三）团结复查。各村进行了大检查运动，检查中普遍发现三不彻底：（１）斗争地主不彻底。如城关区在这次斗争中发现地主隐瞒水地二百零五亩，旱地七百八十亩。（２）填平不彻底。最好的村南冯昌，也发现果实分配不公，许多贫农分到的都是坏地。（３）“落后”发动不彻底。继城是工作较好的村镇，竟发现还有六百廿五人不参加开会；和村一次运动即有一百九十七户自报给地主放东西。这样自满情绪被克服了，干部和群众的眼睛更明亮起来，大家更深刻体会到“农民不齐心，地主不死心，干群不团结，封建难消灭，落后不发动，封建挤不净，消灭封建真不容易”。
    各村就在这个基础上重新调整领导机构，大量吸收了这次运动中的贫农新积极分子，组成数量强大的包容新老积极分子的领导集团——复查委员会，在“天下农民大团结消灭封建大翻身”的口号下，开展了大规模的深入复查和填平补齐运动。
