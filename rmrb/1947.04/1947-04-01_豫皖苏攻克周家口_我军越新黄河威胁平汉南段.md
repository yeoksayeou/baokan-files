　　YuWanSu Captured Zhoujiakou
    Our Army Crossed the Xin Huanghe Threatening the Southern Section of the Pinghan Railway
    [Report from the YuWanSu Front, dated 30th of last month] Our YuWanSu army recaptured Zhoujiakou, an important town north of Shangshui in the far rear of the Chiang army, in one fell swoop at dawn on the 23rd of last month. The war gains are still being investigated. As of now, our YuWanSu troops have crossed the Xin Huanghe River, threatening the southern section of the Pinghan Railway, and are expanding their gains. (Note: Zhoujiakou, commonly known as Zhoukou, is one of the commercial centers in eastern Henan, located on the east bank of the Xin Huanghe River, at the confluence of the Ying River, Sha River, and Xin Huanghe River—the old Jialu River channel—and the intersection of five highways. The city is divided into three districts by the river: Beizhai, Xizhai, and Nanzhai, with the north belonging to Huaiyang, the south belonging to Shangshui, and the west belonging to Xihua. Livestock from southern Hebei and northern Anhui are mostly concentrated here for sale. Grains, beans, cow and sheep hides, and other goods from various parts of Henan are mostly transported to the lower reaches of the Yangtze River from here.)

　　豫皖苏攻克周家口
    我军越新黄河威胁平汉南段
    【本报豫皖苏前线三十日电】豫皖苏我军于上月二十三日拂晓一举收复蒋军远后方商水以北之重镇周家口，战果正清查中。至现在为止，我豫皖苏部队已越过新黄河，威胁平汉南段，正扩大战果。（按：周家口通称周口，为豫东商业中心之一，靠新黄河东岸，为颖水、沙河、新黄河——故贾鲁河道——之会合口及五条公路交叉点。全市因河水分为北寨、西寨、南寨三区，北属淮阳，南属商水，西属西华。冀鲁南部及皖北之牲畜大都集中此地出售。河南各地杂粮、豆类、牛羊皮等货大都由此输至长江下游。）
