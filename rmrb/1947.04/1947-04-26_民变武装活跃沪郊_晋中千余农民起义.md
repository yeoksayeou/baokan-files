　　Armed People's Uprisings Active in Shanghai Suburbs
    Over a Thousand Farmers Revolt in Jinzhong
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 21st] According to the Shanghai Ta Kung Pao: Armed people's uprisings are extremely active in the suburbs of Shanghai, especially in Pudong. Aside from the large-scale activity in Dongdu Township, the sporadic activities are too numerous to count. Near Dashaxiang in Nanhui along the coast, over twenty villagers carrying various firearms attacked the township's "Self-Defense Force" headquarters, capturing team members Ma Yin and others, along with three short guns. When the fourth regiment of Chiang's Security Brigade in Fengxian patrolled to Maozheng Township, they encountered over ten members of the people's army. A fierce gunfight ensued, and the people's army safely escaped due to favorable terrain. When the team patrolled to Machang Township, they were attacked by seven or eight members of the people's army. The Chiang Kai-shek government is now extremely panicked and attempting to "meticulously study countermeasures" for "suppression." Furthermore, the Chiang Kai-shek governments in Changzhou, Danyang, and other places have established "Suppression Command Posts" in an attempt to suppress the increasingly active people's armies in those areas.
    [Report from this newspaper, Taiyue, 22nd] Unable to endure Yan Xishan's tyrannical policies of conscription and grain seizure, over a thousand farmers in the Yan Xishan-occupied areas of Pingyao and Jiexiu have risen up in revolt, destroying seven village public offices of the Yan clique. On March 19th, over seven hundred men and women farmers from Houguo Village and Daobei Village, ten miles away from Pingyao city, revolted, stormed into the Yan clique's "governing village" public office, seized their self-defense corps' weapons, and severely beat the village head Hou Qinghuai, as well as the Yan clique's "special envoy," "assistants," and village platoon leaders. The next day, two hundred "National Soldiers" conscripted by the Yan clique from Jiajiabao and Liujiazhuang, five miles away from the city, also destroyed the "governing village" public office in Liujiazhuang, shouting, "Anyway, we can't survive, so we can only rise up and fight!" On March 12th, masses from Xinwu, Zhongjie, Fengxian, and other villages north of the Tongpu Railway in Jiexiu formed teams, carrying stones and bricks, and beat to death four people, including "governing village" assistants and village heads. Yan Xishan sent troops to "suppress" them and carried out deceitful propaganda among the masses, but all to no avail.

　　民变武装活跃沪郊
    晋中千余农民起义
    【新华社陕北二十一日电】据沪大公报载：沪郊浦东武装民变军异常活跃，除东杜乡有大股活动外，零星活动几不可数计。南汇沿海大沙乡附近乡民二十余人携长短枪械袭击该乡“自卫队”部，将队员马寅高等及短枪三枝全数俘去。奉贤蒋记保安队四团巡逻至茅正乡时，与民军十余人遭遇，一时枪声密集，结果民军在有利地形下安全逸出。迨该队巡至马厂乡时，又遭民军七、八人袭击。现蒋记政府非常恐慌，图“缜密研究对策”“清剿”中。又常州、丹阳等地蒋记政府设立“清剿指挥所”，企图镇压日益活跃之该地民军。
    【本报太岳二十二日电】不堪阎锡山抓丁抢粮暴政，平（遥）介（休）阎占区千余农民揭竿起义，捣毁阎顽村公所七处。平遥离城十里的侯郭村、道备村男女农民七百余人于三月十九日起义，袭入阎顽“治村”公所，夺去其自卫团枪支，痛殴村长侯清怀及阎顽“特派员”、“协助员”、村连排长等。次日，离城五里的贾家堡、刘家庄也有阎顽抽调之“国民兵”二百名将刘家庄“治村”公所捣毁，高呼“反正是不能活了，只有起来干！”三月十二日，介休同蒲路以北辛武、中街、凤仙等村群众结队，拿着石头砖瓦，将“治村”协助员、村长等四人打死。阎锡山曾先后派兵前往“镇压”，并向群众进行欺骗宣传，均无效果。
