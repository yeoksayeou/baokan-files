【Report from the Jiluyu Front of this newspaper on the 1st】Wounded and sick soldiers in a certain hospital No. 1 of the Jiluyu Field Hospital launched a mutual aid movement, creating five types of organizations for self-management of work and life. (1) Mutual aid groups are the core of carrying out mutual aid and meritorious service among the wounded and sick. After its establishment, model wounded soldiers emerged continuously. For example, combat heroes Kang Cong, Zheng Zhenhua, and Liu Tingbang from Unit 212, in addition to being able to recuperate peacefully, actively helped those with severe injuries to fetch meals, assisted those with minor injuries to eat in the kitchen, helped with some daily work in the hospital, and promoted new therapies. Teams two and three also launched a mutual aid competition. When convalescents returned to their units, the mutual aid group transferred their achievements during hospitalization along with the introductory letter or evaluation form. (2) Correspondence Group: promptly publishes the model deeds and victory news of the convalescents on the blackboard newspaper to promote work. (3) Civil Affairs Group: When arriving at a new station, it organizes everyone to help the local people to stand up and carry out propaganda. Comrade Zhang Yunlai, a model convalescent, often carried water and pushed the millstone for the villagers. Before moving, the Civil Affairs Group also has to check mass discipline. Because the discipline is good, the masses often spontaneously organize comfort visits. (4) Comfort Group: Composed of wounded soldiers who are about to be discharged from the hospital, responsible for better caring for and comforting the sick and wounded. Whenever a wounded person is carried in, the comrades of this group would carry lanterns in the middle of the night to help the wounded person down, arrange for food and lodging and warmth, then talk about the benefits of the new therapy, and often report victory news from the front in the wounded person's room to help the new wounded solve their difficulties in life. (5) Economic Committee: Everyone is responsible for managing the meals, making the accounts public, improving life under the current supply system, making sure that the meals do not repeat for ten days, and eating half a catty of rice every other day. These methods have made the relationship between medical staff and convalescents exceptionally close, and the sick and injured also recover quickly.

　　冀鲁豫某野战医院一所
    伤病员掀起互助运动
    【本报冀鲁豫前线一日电】冀鲁豫野战医院某院一所伤病员掀起互助运动，创造自己管理工作和生活的五种组织。（一）互助组，是开展伤病员互助立功的核心。成立后，模范伤员即不断涌现。如二一二部战斗英雄康从、郑振华、刘廷邦等，除自己能安心休养外，并积极帮助重彩号打饭菜，扶轻彩号到火房吃饭，帮助院里一些日常工作，宣传新疗法等。二队与三队并展开了互助竞赛。休养员归队时，互助组在介绍信或鉴定表上把住院时功绩一起转走。（二）通讯组，及时把休养员的模范事迹和胜利消息在黑板报发表，推动工作。（三）民运组，到新驻地时，就组织大家帮助村里群众翻身，进行宣传。模范休养员张运来同志经常替老乡挑水推碾。移动前，民运组又要检查群众纪律。因纪律好，群众常自动组织慰劳。（四）慰劳组，由将出院的伤员组成，负责更好地照顾和安慰伤病员。每有彩号抬来，该组同志半夜也提着灯把彩号扶下来，布置食宿和保温，然后讲新疗法好处，并经常到伤员房里报告前方胜利消息，帮助新伤员解决生活上的困难。（五）经济委员会，火食由大家负责管理，做到账目公开，在现在供给制度下改善生活，使十天饭菜不重样，隔天吃半斤饭。这些办法使医务员同志及休养员同志关系异常密切，伤病也好得快。
