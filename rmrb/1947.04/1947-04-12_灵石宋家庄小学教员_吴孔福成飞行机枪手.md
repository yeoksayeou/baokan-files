[This report from our Taiyue office on the 10th] Wu Kongfu, a teacher at Songjiazhuang Elementary School in Lingshi District, taught while also participating in the militia, becoming a renowned flying machine gunner. The district government once transferred him to teach in a larger village farther from the enemy, but he refused, saying, "Although I earn half as much grain here as I would in the larger village, I can protect the interests of the masses in this area, and that is my greatest honor." On March 8th, when the enemy harassed Songjiagou near the village, he immediately carried his machine gun and rushed to reinforce the village militia, cooperating with the Hejiabao militia to attack the enemy. The enemy, unable to withstand the assault, fled. On the 9th, when more than fifty enemies invaded Renyi Village, Wu Kongfu again carried his machine gun and engaged in fierce fighting with the enemy on the southern slope between Zhangzhuang and Renyi, driving them back. Because he ran so fast, the local people called him the "flying machine gunner."

    吴孔福成飞行机枪手
    【本报太岳十日电】灵石一区宋家庄小学教员吴孔福，一面教书，一面参加民兵，成为驰名的飞行机枪射手。区政府曾调他到另一个距敌较远的大村教学，他拒绝说：“在这里比在大村虽然少赚一半粮，可是能保卫这一带群众的利益，这是我的最大光荣。”三月八日，敌人到该村附近之宋家沟骚扰，他听到后马上背起机枪随本村民兵急往增援，配合赫家堡民兵向敌袭击，敌不支逃去，九日敌五十余人进犯仁义村，吴孔福又扛起机枪在章庄与仁义间之南坡与敌展开激战，将敌打退，由于他跑得很快，当地群众都称他为“飞行机枪手”。
