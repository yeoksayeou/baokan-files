　　The liberated masses in the border counties of the Taihang First Military Sub-district, in order to protect their land, property, and lives, have risen up en masse to resist the inhuman acts of arson, murder, rape, and pillage by Chiang's and puppet troops with indigenous weapons. After the militia forces of various counties formed joint defense units, they frequently went out to participate in battles or support other villages. When Chiang's and the puppet "Homecoming Legions" took the opportunity to stir up trouble, the masses in various counties automatically took up indigenous weapons to fight them. Initially, it was Gaojiazhuang in Gaoyi County that repelled the "Homecoming Legion" with indigenous guns, which had a great impact on the surrounding villages. At that time, the leaders seized this point to promote it throughout the county. Subsequently, Liu Zhanlin of Liujiazhuang combined tunnels with wooden clubs to strike at the enemy, and Liu Yinke of Xujiazhuang used a manure fork to beat the enemy out of the house. Encouraged by the news of these victories with indigenous weapons, the leadership seized the opportunity to vigorously promote the movement of the broad masses using indigenous weapons to fight against the enemy. This movement has spread throughout the border counties of Jingxing, Huolu, Yuanshi, Zanhuang, Gaoyi, etc., and has created many new indigenous weapons. For example, the masses of Wu Bai Village in Gaoyi County made fifteen indigenous cannons out of tap water pipes. After careful research by Wang Qingchang, a hero in killing the enemy in the county, and the militia of Dongguan, the ignition of the water pipe cannon has been changed to a light artillery-style firing machine, increasing the effective range to 300 meters. Currently, the city gate alone has ×× water pipe cannons. On the third day after Wu Bai Village made the water pipe cannons, it repelled the enemy's attack. For more than two months, the enemy has never dared to go to the village again. The development of indigenous weapons in Zanhuang is also very common. In addition to the militiamen in the border areas having rifles, the county already has hundreds of indigenous guns. With the development and creation of indigenous guns and cannons, indigenous landmines (i.e., stone mines) in Zanhuang, Gaoyi, Yuanshi, and other places have also been greatly developed. Last autumn, when the masses in the plains of Zanhuang sent grain to the mountainous areas, they brought back stones on their return trip. In December, when the enemy attacked Beima Village, fourteen landmines were detonated at once, killing and wounding several enemies. The confidence of the masses was boosted, and by the end of the year, the masses had dug more than 16,500 stone mines, and most villages could choose their own ignition electric tubes. Gaoyi villages have widely installed bottle mines, jar mines, pot mines... Everywhere around the militia blockhouses, fortifications, and mass housing, there are crisscrossing firing lines. In addition, tunnel warfare in the border counties of the First Military Sub-district is quite common, except for a few counties and districts. With the combination of blockhouses, fortifications, tunnels, and indigenous weapons, the mass character of the struggle is even greater. In many border villages, women also joined the militia. Relying on the tunnels, they dared to pull the mines when the enemy entered the village, and went to the flat roofs to keep watch for the militia. It is not uncommon for couples to be militiamen together. Liberated peasants and self-defense forces in their forties and fifties in Gaoyi have automatically organized the "Second Militia Armed Self-Defense Force," which has now grown to be equivalent to the number of militiamen in the county and has strong combat effectiveness. The militia armed forces can now take the initiative to attack behind enemy lines. Because of the development of the entire populace being armed, the struggle situation in the border areas of the First Military Sub-district has completely changed, and the people have gradually gained the initiative in the war.
　　
　　[Reported by this newspaper] A unit of militia (about 100 people) from the first, sixth, and eighth districts of Pingle County suddenly attacked Beicun Village in Dongshan last month on the sixth, and completely surrounded the armed forces of the village "governing village." Only 100 hand grenades were used to resolve the battle, capturing alive eight puppet squad leaders and below, wounding more than ten people, killing eight people, and capturing five rifles, one light cannon, ten shells, one large landmine, more than sixty hand grenades, and more than one hundred rounds of ammunition. Our militia suffered no casualties. (Hu Fenguang)

　　[Reported by this newspaper] On the third of this month, more than seventy members of the "Homecoming Legion" in Huolu City were looting grain in Shuiyu Village in the west of the city. They were surrounded by our Huolu Independent Battalion on three sides, killing and wounding fifteen people and capturing thirty people alive. We obtained one machine gun, thirty-four long and short guns, and seized 700 catties of grain, 60 catties of wheat, and 27 head of livestock, which were returned to the masses. On the same day, more than forty members of the "Homecoming Legion" in Nanyin Village, Yuanshi County, went to Xitongxia to rob grain and kidnap people. They were defeated by our Yuanshi Independent Battalion, rescuing fifty-seven people and seizing ten head of livestock, two carts, five bales of cotton, thirteen bundles, and many other clothes, most of which were returned to the masses. On the sixth, more than thirty members of the "Homecoming Legion" in the west of Yuanshi City came out to rob grain and were ambushed by our Fuhe unit at Yelu Tou, where eleven people were captured and the rest fled back.

　　太行一分区取得战争主动
    全民武装保家抗蒋
    土武器结合地道战屡创蒋伪军
    【本报太行三日电】一分区边沿各县翻身群众，为保卫土地财产和生命，群起以土武器抵抗蒋伪灭绝人性的烧杀淫掠行为。各县民兵武装组成联防后，经常外出参战或支援他村，而蒋伪“还乡团”却乘机蠢动，各县群众便自动拿出土武器和“还乡团”作战。最初是高邑高家庄用土枪打退了“还乡团”，给附近各村很大影响。当时领导人即抓住这点推动全县，随着又有刘家庄刘占林结合地道用木棒打击敌人，许家庄刘银科用粪杈把敌人打出门外等事实出现。由于这些以土武器打退敌人的消息所鼓舞，领导方面抓紧大力提倡，广大群众使用土武器与敌进行斗争的运动，已遍及井陉、获鹿、元氏、赞皇、高邑等边沿县，并创造不少新的土武器。如高邑五百村群众以自来水管造出土炮十五门，经该县杀敌英雄王庆昌与东关民兵悉心研究，现已将水管炮点火改为轻炮式的发火机，有效射程提高到三百公尺。现仅城关即有水管炮××门。五百村刚制起水管炮第三天，就打退敌人进攻，至今已两月余，敌人始终未敢再到该村。赞皇土武器发展也很普遍，除边地民兵均有步枪外，全县已拥有土枪数百支。随着土枪土炮的发挥与创造，赞皇、高邑、元氏等地的土制地雷（即石雷）亦大为发展。赞皇平原群众在去秋向山地送粮中，返回时全捎石头。十二月敌进攻北马村，一次踏响地雷十四颗，敌死伤数人，群众信心提高，到年底群众即凿成石雷一万六千五百余个，发火电管大部分村庄可以自选。高邑各村普遍装制瓶雷、坛雷、壶雷……。民兵炮楼工事及群众住房周围，随处都有纵横交错拉火线。此外，一分区边沿各县地道战，除个别县区外，发展相当普遍。在炮楼、工事、地道、土武器的结合下，斗争的群众性更加广大，不少边沿村庄，妇女也参加了民兵，她们凭着地道，敢于在敌人进村时拉雷，上平房给民兵放哨，夫妇同为民兵者，已不稀罕。高邑四五十岁的翻身农民及自卫队，自动组织“第二民兵武装自卫队”，现已发展到相当于全县民兵数量，且战斗力很强。民兵武装已可主动出击敌后，因为全民武装的发展，各县完全改变了过去一分区边沿的斗争形势，人民已经逐渐取得战争主动。
    【本报讯】平定一、六、八区民兵各一部（约百余人）于上月六日突袭东山北村，将该村“治村”武装全部包围，仅用手榴弹百颗解决斗争，计生俘伪分队长以下八名，打伤十余人，打死八名，获得步枪五支，轻炮一门，炮弹十个，大地雷一个，手榴弹六十余个，子弹百余发，我民兵毫无伤亡。（胡奋光）
    【本报讯】本月三日，获鹿城“还乡团”七十余人，正在城西水峪村抢粮，被我获鹿独立营三面包围，毙伤十五人，活捉三十名。我得机枪一挺，长短枪三十四支，夺下谷子七百斤、麦子六十斤、牲口二十七头，交还群众。同日，元氏南尹村“还乡团”四十余人，到西同下抢粮绑人，被我元氏独立营击溃，解救老百姓五十七名，缴回牲口十头，大车两辆、棉花五包、包袱十三个，其他衣物甚多，大部交还群众。六日，元氏城西关“还乡团”三十余人出来抢粮，走到野鹿头，遭我复河部伏击，被捉十一人，其余逃回。（赵怀治）
