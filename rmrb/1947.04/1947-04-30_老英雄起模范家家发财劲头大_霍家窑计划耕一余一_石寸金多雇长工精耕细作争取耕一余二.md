　　Old Hero Sets Example, Every Family Has Great Enthusiasm for Getting Rich
    Huo Jia Yao Plans to "Cultivate One, Surplus One"
    Shi Cunjin Hires More Laborers for Intensive Farming, Striving for "Cultivate One, Surplus Two"
    [This newspaper's report from Licheng] After three years of organized large-scale production movement in Huo Jia Yao, last year it generally reached more than "cultivate two, surplus one." After the land reform movement, the peasants reclaimed more than 300 mu of land from the hands of feudal landlords. Now the village has an average of 2.6 mu of land per person, and the desire to develop production and get rich is even more urgent. However, some problems still exist in the peasants' thinking and practical work, which affect the vigorous development of the production movement. First, there is no unity in the corvée labor of the four natural villages, and the old accounts have not been cleared. For example, Liang Tai of Huo Jia Yao reflected: "Our village alone has contributed hundreds of workdays from last winter to now, without receiving a single wage. If this continues, there will be no farming this year." Second, the leadership holds too many meetings and does too little work, and the masses are unwilling to cooperate with the cadres. Huo Fuchun said: "This year, I will not be with the cadres. They are always holding meetings. If I cooperate with them, I have to cultivate their land for them." Furthermore, the integration of agriculture and sideline occupations has not been well organized. The village has more than 90 livestock, which are used for transportation every day, but a lot of land has not been harrowed, and manure has not been delivered. On the other hand, some people are complacent and think there is no problem, thus relaxing production.
    In light of these situations, a mass meeting of more than 300 men, women, old and young from the whole village was held on the 19th of this month to mobilize production, solve the above-mentioned problems, and unanimously decided to plant more cotton, 8-1 millet, peanuts, and Golden Queen corn this year. In terms of sideline occupations, all the livestock in the village will be organized for transportation. In terms of textiles, we will continue to train weavers, increase tools, and strive for the whole village to generally achieve "cultivate one, surplus one" this year.
    At the meeting, Shi Cunjin, a first-class labor hero of Taihang, talked about his personal production plan for this year. He said: "In addition to the general similarities with last year, I have a total of 24.4 mu of land this year. I will plant 7.7 mu of 8-1 millet, 3.5 mu of cotton, and all the corn will be Golden Queen. By implementing intensive cultivation, I estimate that in addition to the general harvest being the same as last year, the 8-1 millet and cotton will yield 6.85 shi more of coarse grains than last year. In terms of sideline occupations, the team has four large sows, two of which have already given birth to twelve piglets, and the other two are about to give birth, estimated to also give birth to twelve, totaling twenty-four. By the end of the year, the four sows can have another litter, each estimated to give birth to ten (the second litter is more than the first), totaling sixty-four. I will take one-third of the shares, and I can get twenty-one. Each one will be sold for 3,000 yuan, totaling 63,000 yuan, equivalent to 12 shi of grain. Two mules for transportation can earn 400,000 yuan throughout the year, equivalent to 28 shi of grain. Last year, two people spun four liang a day. Women will step up spinning, earning 6.5 shi more grain this year than last year. The cooperative invested 7,000 yuan more than last year, equivalent to one shi of grain. Two cows gave birth to two calves, sold for 100,000 yuan, equivalent to 15 shi of grain. In addition, hatching chicks, planting trees, etc., the total agricultural and sideline income will increase by more than 68 shi of coarse grain compared to last year. In terms of expenses, building three houses, wages, materials, food and drink will require a total of 12 shi of coarse grain. In addition, hiring two more long-term workers, increasing cattle labor, paying more public grain by one shi, and clothing expenses, I can achieve 'cultivate one, surplus two' this year." After the old laborer finished speaking, everyone clamored about how they would do it themselves, proposing to learn from the old laborer, make production plans, get rich, and the mood was very high.

　　老英雄起模范家家发财劲头大
    霍家窑计划耕一余一 
    石寸金多雇长工精耕细作争取耕一余二
    【本报黎城讯】霍家窑经过三年组织起来的大生产运动，去年已普遍达到耕二余一有余，土地改革运动以后，农民从封建地主手里清算回土地三百余亩，现全村每人平均有土地二亩六分，生产发家致富要求更为迫切。但农民思想上及实际工作中还存在着一些问题没有解决，影响到生产运动的大力开展。首先在差务方面，四个自然村不统一，过去差账没有清理。如霍家窑梁太反映：“光咱一个村去年冬到现在出了好几百工，也没有得到一个工资，这样下去，今年就不用种地啦。”其次领导上开会多做事少，群众不愿和干部互助。霍富春就这样说：“今年咱可不和干部们到一块，他们整天光开会啦，和他互助还得给他代耕哩。”再一个农副业结合没有组织好，全村九十余头牲口，每天运输，可是地还有好多没耙，粪也没有送。另一方面有些群众存在自满情绪认为不成问题，因而放松了生产。
    根据这些情况，本月十九日召开全村男女老幼三百余人群众大会动员生产，解决了上述各种问题，并一致决定今年在农业上再多种棉花、八一谷、花生及金皇后；副业上把全村所有牲口全部组织起来运输；纺织上继续培养织妇，增加工具，争取全村今年普遍达到耕一余一。
    会上，太行一等劳动英雄石寸金谈他个人今年的生产计划，他说：“我今年除一般和去年相同外，农业上共地二十四亩四分，要种七亩七分八一谷，种三亩半棉花，玉茭全部种金皇后。实行精耕细作，计算起来，除一般和去年一样收成外，八一谷棉花比去年能增收粗粮六石八斗五。副业方面，队里有四只大母猪，两只已下了十二只小猪，其余两只也快下了，估计也下十二只共二十四只，到年底四只母猪还能再下一窝，每只估计下十只（第二窝比第一窝要多下），总共六十四只，自己顶三分之一股，能分二十一只；每只卖三千元共卖六万三千元，折谷十二石，两头骡运输，全年可赚四十万元，折谷二十八石。纺织去年两人每天纺四两，妇女加紧纺织，今年较去年多赚谷六石半。合作社投资比去年多七千元，折谷一石、两只母牛下两只小牛，卖洋十万元，折谷十五石。另外孵小鸡栽树等，总共农副业比去年增加收入六十八石多粗粮。开支方面，盖房三间，工资材料吃喝共需粗粮十二石；此外，多顾二个长工，增加牛工多交公粮一石及衣服开支外，今年能达到耕一余二。老劳动谈罢后，大家都嚷嚷着自己怎样搞，提出要学习老劳动，订生产计划，发家致富，情绪非常高。（慧明、靖国、立民）
