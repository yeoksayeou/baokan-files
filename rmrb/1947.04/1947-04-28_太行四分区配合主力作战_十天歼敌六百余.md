　　Taihang Fourth Military Sub-district Cooperates with Main Force in Combat
    Ten Days Annihilating Over Six Hundred Enemies
    [Our Dispatch] Under the slogan "Cooperate with Commander Liu Deng in launching a victorious counterattack against the Chiang troops invading northern Henan, return to our old homes, settle scores and redress grievances," the troops of the Taihang Fourth Military Sub-district and the regular militia are persisting in the continuous anti-"mopping up" battles on both sides of the Daoqing Railway. Regardless of fatigue, they immediately converged on all of the Chiang troops' communication lines and stronghold cities, launching heroic sabotage and siege battles. From March 25th to April 5th, in ten days, after thirteen major battles, a total of fourteen iron bridges and twelve wooden bridges were destroyed or blown up, along with one vehicle; forty li of railway, thirty li of highway, and twenty li of electric wire were damaged. At the same time, the strongholds of Encun and Wolonggang were captured. As a result, the enemy's transportation was cut off, and they had no choice but to be trapped in their strongholds. When our army captured the above two strongholds, the Chiang troops in Wucun, Wuliyuan, Dalu Village, Ligu, Majie, Yuhe, Chongyi, Ningguo, Wangfeng, and Fengfeng fled in panic one after another, and our local armed forces immediately recovered the above ten strongholds. The Chiang troops of the 59th Regiment of the Reorganized 3rd Division, stationed in Encun, fled in a hurry towards Daiwangji, but were intercepted by our army at Zhu Guo Village. Over one hundred enemies were annihilated, and thirty bodies were left behind. One of our units, with a small force, repelled two regiments of the Chiang army's Reorganized 3rd Division that were coming to the east in support from Jiaozuo. Currently, the troops of the military sub-district are closely monitoring the enemy trapped in the cities. In the above battles, a total of 563 enemies were killed, 46 Chiang and puppet troops were captured, three light machine guns and seventy rifles were seized, along with over 20,000 rounds of ammunition, 249 various artillery shells, and a large number of other military supplies. During the combat activities, the morale of the people's fighters was extremely high. Despite the fact that they were destroying at night and fighting during the day, everyone showed no signs of fatigue. Comrade Guo Shenzhong, a platoon leader of a certain unit, was knocked down by a hail of bullets, but he got up without a groan and charged forward again. Two cooks from the 5th Company of the Matun Unit refused to have their wounds dressed immediately, and instead chased after the enemy and captured a rifle. Guo Xiaozhi, a soldier of the 4th squad of a certain unit, under the enemy's sweeping fire, climbed twenty-odd electric poles barefoot, enabling the unit to collect over 750 jin of electric wire in a short period of time.
