Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 7th. Prices in the coastal ports and areas bordering the KMT-occupied zones of the Jiaodong Liberated Area have generally fallen over the past month. In Yantai City, corn has dropped from 54 Northern Currency units per jin (each unit equivalent to 15 KMT currency units) to 42 units, soybeans from 65 to 59 units, wheat from 64 to 55 units, raw oil from 120 to 104 units, fine cloth from 27,000 to 22,000 units per bolt, and gold from 60,000 to 49,400 units per tael, with an average index of 83 percent. Taking the area around Yaqian County (new county) as an example, corn has dropped from 46 units per jin to 38.5 units, soybeans from 58 to 56 units, wheat from 54.5 to 48 units, raw oil from 107 to 90 units, and cotton from 600 to 550 units, with an average index of 88 percent.

Gold transactions in the seaports of Yantai, Weihai, and Longkou have expanded two to three times compared to the previous month. Merchants in various locations are now selling their inventories, turning over capital, and expanding their businesses. Markets in Jiaodong are extremely active, a stark contrast to Qingdao, where prices have soared more than doubled in the past two to three months.
