Taiyue Administrative Office Solves the Problem of Livestock Shortage for the Masses
　　Issues an Additional 100 Million in Agricultural Loans
[Report from our Taiyue office on the 9th] In order to meet the urgent demand of the masses for livestock after obtaining land, the Taiyue Administrative Office, in addition to mobilizing the masses to pool funds to purchase livestock, specifically decided at a government affairs meeting on March 29th to issue an additional 100 million yuan in loans. The 150 million yuan in spring loans that have already been issued are now being actively distributed in various regions. This loan issuance basically overcomes the past practice of a simple task-oriented viewpoint, where loans were dispersed and could not play a significant role. Instead, local banks and government cadres actively organize the masses to help each other purchase livestock, and banks implement loan purchases for the masses, or first use loans to organize the masses to transport goods and engage in handicraft production, earning money to buy livestock.

　　太岳行署解决群众畜力困难
    增发农贷一万万
    【本报太岳九日电】太岳行署为适应群众获得土地后迫切解决畜力的要求，除动员群众集股购买外，特于三月二十九日经政务会议决定，增发贷款一万万元。日前已发放的一万五千万春贷，现正在各地积极贷出。此次贷放，基本上克服了过去单纯任务观点，使贷款分散，不能起很大作用的做法，而由各地银行和政府干部积极组织群众互助购买牲口，银行实行为群众贷购，或先以贷款组织群众运输及手工业生产，赚下钱来买牲口。
