Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 17th: Our correspondent reports: Since January and up to early April this year, the Chiang army has launched four consecutive offensives against the Linjiang area of ​​Liaodong. Each time, it suffered a disastrous defeat. Although Du Yuming scraped together troops to concentrate his forces, each time there were more, but their combat effectiveness and morale were weaker than the last. Their failures were also more tragic each time. During its first offensive, all the forces used were six divisions, and it took a week to be crushed, with more than 2,000 enemy soldiers killed. During its second offensive, the forces used were two divisions, and the time to resolve the battle was two-thirds shorter than the first time, with twice as many enemy soldiers killed as the first time. During its third offensive, the forces used were five divisions, and the time to resolve the battle was again two-thirds shorter than the second time, with three and a half times more enemy soldiers killed than the first time. In the fourth offensive, although Du Yuming mobilized ten divisions, the number of enemy soldiers killed increased fivefold compared to the first time. The entire 89th Division, fully equipped with American weapons, and the 162nd Regiment of the 54th Division, were completely annihilated in just ten hours. On the other hand, the Democratic Allied Army is completely the opposite. In the continuous crushing of the Chiang army's four offensives, they became stronger and stronger, with even more vigorous morale, creating more and more examples of defeating the enemy with fewer troops each time. For example, when the Chiang army's first offensive was crushed, combat heroes such as Fang Zijing appeared in a certain unit, and two people wiped out a squad of enemies and defeated a platoon of enemies. In the second battle, the combat hero Wang Yongtai appeared, wiping out 38 enemies by himself; another group of only three people wiped out 62 enemies. In the third battle, four combat heroes, including Gao Rongfu, appeared, chasing the enemy for more than ten miles and wiping out more than 60 enemies. Combat hero Cheng Shutang even created a miracle by wiping out more than 60 enemies. In the current Liunan battle, more than 9,000 enemies were wiped out with a casualty ratio of one to eighty. Wu Xuan, a veteran combat hero of a certain unit, led a platoon into a heavy encirclement with dozens of times more enemies than us, and cooperated with the main force to wipe out an enemy battalion. A platoon of a certain unit defeated two companies of the enemy, and it is impossible to enumerate the number of individuals who wiped out a squad or a platoon of the enemy. The above facts prove that the decline of the Chiang army's combat effectiveness and morale and the rise of our army's combat effectiveness and morale are becoming a clear contrast. All commanders and fighters of the Democratic Allied Army believe that if the Chiang army launches another offensive in the future, it will be given an even more severe blow.

    四犯临江地区战役显示
    东北我军愈战愈强
    蒋军战斗力日衰弱
    【新华社东北十七日电】本社记者报导：自今年一月至四月初止，蒋军对辽东临江地区连续发动之四次进攻，每次都遭到惨败，杜聿明挖肉补疮集中兵力，虽一次比一次多，但战斗力与士气却一次比一次弱。其失败也一次比一次更惨。当其第一次进攻时，所有兵力为六个师的番号，经过了一周时间，始被粉碎，被歼人数二千余名。其第二次进攻时，所用兵力为两个师，解决战斗时间则比第一次缩短三分之二，被歼人数比第一次多两倍。其第三次进攻时为五个师的番号，解决战斗时间又比第二次缩短三分之二，被歼人数比第一次多三倍半了。第四次杜聿明虽动员了十个师的番号，但其被歼人数却比第一次增至五倍，全副美械装备的八十九师及五四师一六二团全部，仅在十小时内即全部覆灭。反观民主联军则完全相反，在连续粉碎蒋军四次进攻中愈战愈强，士气益加旺盛，一次比一次更多的创造了以少胜多的歼敌范例。以在第一次粉碎蒋军进攻时，某部出现了战斗英雄房子静等，二人歼敌一个班，打垮敌人一个排。第二次战役则又出现了战斗英雄王永泰，仅一人即歼敌卅八人；另一组仅三人歼敌六十二人。第三次战役中更出现了战斗英雄高荣福等四人，追敌人十余里，歼敌六十余名。战斗英雄程树堂更创造了歼敌六十余名的奇迹。至此次柳南战役，则以一比八十之伤亡比例，歼敌九千余。我某部战斗老英雄吴煊一个排，杀入敌人数十倍于我之重围，配合主力歼敌一个营。某部一个排即打垮敌人两个连，而一个人即歼敌一个班一个排者就难以枚举了。从以上事实证明，蒋军战斗力及士气之下降与我军战斗力及士气的上升正成为显明的对照。民主联军全体指战员认为今后如果蒋军再次发动进攻，必将予以更严重的打击。
