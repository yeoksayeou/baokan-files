　　Pay Attention to Ideological Mobilization
    Thoroughly Liquidate Landlords in Ganji
    [Report from our Jinnan office, 26th] The inspection movement in Ganji Town, Wei County, has developed in depth. Eight hundred poor and middle peasant households have participated in the struggle. Membership has grown from over two hundred to over one thousand four hundred. All landlords have been liquidated, and two rich peasant households have had their feudal vestiges cut off. Over eight hundred mu of land have been cleared out, with each person leveling more than four mu of land. Over fifty residences and four hundred pieces of agricultural tools, woodenware, and various supplies have been investigated. In the early stages of the inspection, landlords used various methods to organize a defense. For example, Pan Lao Xi used methods of fake division of property and fake pawning to retain one hundred mu of land and nearly one hundred houses. At the same time, he used petty favors to disintegrate the internal unity of the peasants and bought off two peasant representatives to defend the Pan family. After extensive discussions by the groups, the conspiracy of landlords infiltrating the peasant association in an attempt to fool and rule the peasants was exposed. The leadership also guided the masses to separate from the landlords ideologically, allowing the masses to recognize from their own experience that landlords were not easily defeated at once. Then, a mass movement to inspect hidden materials of the landlords was launched. Zhang Lao Tai used gossip and kinship to find out that Zhang Lao En had hidden two large carts and one earthen cart at relatives' homes in a large village. At the same time, the slogan of creating model streets was put forward, and each street launched mutual competitions. After everyone's comments, three conditions were put forward: no mass deceived into hiding things for landlords; no thoughts of changing the regime; and landlords completely eliminated. Each street is working towards this direction, and an ideological re-examination is to be launched to more thoroughly separate from the landlords ideologically.

　　注意进行思想发动
    干集彻底清算地主
    【本报冀南二十六日电】威县干集镇的检查运动深入发展，八百户贫、中农都参加了斗争，会员从二百余发展到一千四百余名，地主皆被清算，两户富农割掉封建尾巴，清理出土地八百余亩，每人填平四亩多地，清查出宅子五十余处，农具木器及各种物资四百件。检查初期，地主用各种方法组织防御，如潘老席利用假分家、假当的办法，保持一百亩土地和近百间房屋，同时利用小恩小惠，瓦解农民内部，收买农民代表二人，为潘家辩护。经过小组广泛的检讨，揭露了地主混进农会，企图愚弄统治农民等阴谋。领导上并引导群众与地主从思想上分家，让群众从自己的经验中认识地主一时不易斗透，接着便开展群众性的检查地主隐蔽物资的运动。张老太太利用闲说和亲族关系，探到张老恩藏到大村亲戚家两辆大车，一辆土车。同时又提出创造模范街的口号，各街掀起互相竞赛、经大家评论提出有三个条件：没有一个给地主藏东西受骗群众；没有变天思想；地主消灭的干净。各街正向这个方向努力，要展开思想复查，更彻底的从思想上与地主分家。
