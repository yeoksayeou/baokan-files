　　Taiyue Our Army Sweeps the Lower Reaches of the Fen River
    Liberating Five Cities Including Xinjiang and Hejin
    Valiantly Advanced Westward to Recapture the Natural Barrier of the Yellow River at Yumengkou, Killing and Capturing Over 5,500 Enemy Troops, Including a Deputy Brigade Commander
    [This newspaper, Taiyue Front, 9th dispatch] Under the call to defend the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the troops of General Chen Geng of the People's Liberation Army, fought bravely and made meritorious deeds. At 5:00 PM on the 4th, they launched attacks on Yicheng, Houma, Mengcheng and other places. After two days and nights of fighting, they first captured the allegedly impregnable Yicheng and the enemy stronghold of Taishenmiao. Subsequently, with the momentum of a sweeping storm, they recaptured important towns such as Houma and Qucun, as well as Mengcheng, Gaoxian, Aikou, Nanfan, and Dajiao towns on the railway line in Jiang County. They annihilated parts of the 27th Brigade and the 49th Regiment of the 17th Brigade, as well as the entire Bao 5th Regiment. They captured alive Wang Shuchen, deputy brigade commander of the 27th Brigade, Zhang Pinde, head of the Security Regiment, and over 3,800 people including the county magistrate of Yicheng and Changzi, and killed and wounded over 500 people. Another unit of our army, in coordination with the northern front operations, bravely raided the Yuncheng Airport on the night of the 4th, and destroyed the enemy's only three American-made bombers. There are many other battle results that are currently being investigated.
    [This newspaper, Taiyue Front, 10th dispatch] The Jinnan People's Liberation Army continues to expand its victories. On the 7th and 8th, it successively captured four county towns and the natural gateway of the Yellow River, Yumengkou. On the 7th, after capturing Yicheng and Houma, the Jinnan People's Liberation Army advanced towards Jiangzhou (Xinjiang), Jishan, Hejin, and Yumengkou, the throat linking Shanxi and Shaanxi; another unit advanced on Fushan, encircling Fencheng. Wherever the elite troops arrived, the momentum was like splitting bamboo. First, at 5:00 AM on the 7th, within three hours and at a very small cost, they captured the important industrial city of Jiangzhou (i.e., Xinjiang City) in southern Shanxi, capturing over 700 people. We only suffered eight minor injuries, two serious injuries, and two deaths in action. After entering the city, discipline was strict, and no violations occurred. The residents of the city greeted them with cheers, as if "heavenly soldiers" had arrived. Shops reopened for business as usual that afternoon. The next day (the 8th) at 8:00 AM, they again captured Jishan County within four hours, annihilating all the defending enemy troops and capturing over 500 enemy officers, including the regimental commander and battalion commander. The army continued to advance westward. The defending enemy troops in Hejin City and Yumengkou fled upon hearing the news, and both places were liberated. The unit advancing on Fushan approached the suburbs on the 8th. Before any contact was made, the defending enemy troops abandoned the city and fled, and Fushan City was also liberated. From the 4th to the 8th, within five days, we successively captured five county towns, recovered 2,400 square kilometers of land, controlled a section of the railway line from Shicun in the south to Dongzhen in the north, approximately 150 li, and many sections of the vertical and horizontal highways of Qu(wo), Gao(xian), Lin(fen), and Fu(shan).
    [This newspaper, Taiyue Front, 9th dispatch] Major General Wang Shuchen, deputy brigade commander of the Jiang army's 27th Brigade, who was captured during the Houma battle on the 5th, recently expressed his thoughts to reporters on the battlefield after being captured. He said, "After the Jiang side occupied Yan'an, they everywhere propagandized that the Eighth Route Army had been annihilated; according to the current facts, the Eighth Route Army has instead annihilated the Kuomintang army." Wang praised the bravery of the People's Liberation Army, and with his own personal experience, explained that the Jiang army's repeated defeats, in addition to command errors, were mainly due to low morale and unwillingness to fight. The soldiers were all conscripted, and no one was willing to die for Jiang. Wang affirmed: "The Kuomintang's plan to eliminate the Communist Party is impossible to realize!" (Attached picture)

　　太岳我军席卷汾河下游
    解放新绛河津等五城
    勇猛西进克复黄河天险禹门口毙俘敌副旅长以下五千五百余
    【本报太岳前线九日电】人民解放军陈赓将军所部，在保卫党中央、保卫毛主席号召下，奋勇立功，于四日下午五时，分别向翼城、侯马、蒙城等地出击。经两昼夜战斗，首将号称攻不破的翼城及泰山庙敌据点攻克，继即以风扫席卷之势克复侯马、曲村等重镇，及铁路线上之蒙城、高显、隘口与绛县之南樊、大交两镇。消灭二十七旅及十七旅四十九团各一部，保五团全部，生俘二十七旅副旅长王树忱，保卫团团长张牝德，翼城及长子县长等以下三千八百余人，毙伤五百余人。另一路我军，为配合北线作战，于四日夜勇猛袭入运城飞机场，将敌仅有之三架美式轰炸机焚毁。其他战果甚多，正清查中。
    【本报太岳前线十日电】晋南人民解放军继续扩大战果。七、八两日连克四座县城及黄河天险渡口禹门口。七日，晋南人民解放军继攻克翼城、侯马后，即向绛州（新绛）、稷山、河津及秦晋咽喉禹门口挺进；另一部进逼浮山，包围汾城。劲旅所至，势如破竹，首于七日拂晓五时，在三小时内以极小代价攻克晋南重要工业城市绛州城（即新绛城），俘虏七百余人。我仅轻伤八人，重伤两人，阵亡二人。入城后纪律严明，秋毫无犯，城内居民欢呼迎接，如“天兵”到来，商店当天下午照常营业。第二天（八日）八时，又以四小时攻克稷山县城，守敌全部就歼，俘敌团长、营长以下五百余人。大军继续向西挺进，河津城及禹门口之守敌，闻风而逃，两地即告光复。进逼浮山之一路，八日逼近城郊时，尚未接触，守敌即弃城逃去，浮山城亦告光复。从四日至八日五天内，我连克五座县城，收复土地二千四百平方公里，控制铁路线史村以南至东镇以北一段约一百五十里，及曲（沃）、高（显）、临（汾）、浮（山）等纵横公路线多处。
    【本报太岳前线九日电】五日侯马战斗中被俘之蒋军二十七旅少将副旅长王树忱氏，顷在战场上对记者发表其被俘后之感想，他说：“蒋方在占领延安之后，到处宣传说八路军已被消灭；根据现在事实，八路军却消灭了国民党军队。”王氏盛赞人民解放军的勇敢，又以自己这次亲自体验，说明蒋军接连被歼，除了指挥上的错误外，主要原因是士气低落，不愿打仗。战士都是抓来的，谁也不肯为蒋卖命。王氏肯定的说：“国民党想消灭共产党的计划，是无法实现的！”（附图片）
