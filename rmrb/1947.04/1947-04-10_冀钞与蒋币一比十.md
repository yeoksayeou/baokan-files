　　Jicha Compared to Chiang Kai-shek's Currency at a Ratio of One to Ten

　　[This newspaper reports] After the Kuomintang issued large-denomination New Customs Gold Units in January, it issued large-denomination new banknotes again in mid-to-late February, causing the currency value to fall further and prices to rise even more. When this new currency appeared in Chiang Kai-shek-controlled markets, people were panicked and uneasy. As a result, in addition to rotating funds in stocks and grain, they were also keen on speculating in salt and miscellaneous grains. Everyone was willing to get rid of legal tender, preferring to hoard goods rather than keep money. Currently, black market prices are more than double the official prices. According to the Tianjin Yishibao, the total amount of Customs Gold Units issued has reached 300,000 times the pre-war level. The recently issued New Customs Gold Units, each worth 500 yuan (equivalent to 10,000 yuan of Chiang Kai-shek's currency), also amount to more than 105 trillion. Large-denomination Chiang Kai-shek currency of 5,000 yuan per note is already circulating in areas such as Xinxiang.

　　In contrast to the depreciation of legal tender, the value and credibility of our Jicha currency have been increasing daily in the past month. Before the Kuomintang promulgated the "Tightening Measures Plan," the exchange rate between Jicha currency and legal tender on the black market was 1 to 3.5 yuan to 6.5 yuan; by the end of March, it had changed to 1 to 6.5 yuan to 10 yuan. Especially when the financial market was in great chaos before and after the promulgation of the Kuomintang's "Tightening Measures Plan," the actual ratio of Jicha currency to Chiang Kai-shek's currency in areas such as Gaoyi and Zanhuang once reached 1 to 12. Near Pingyao, our area saw a sharp increase from 1 to 7 or 8 to 1 to 13. At this time, it was extremely difficult to exchange legal tender for Jicha currency in other places.

　　In addition, the price of drafts in Linqing and Hengshui in the Jinnan District has been falling daily. The Hengshui-Tianjin draft (using 10,000 yuan of legal tender as a unit) was still 2,200 yuan (Jicha currency) at the beginning of the Kuomintang's implementation of the "Tightening Measures," but had gradually fallen to 1,400 yuan by March 25. During the same period, the Linqing-Tianjin draft also fell from 2,250 yuan to 1,400 yuan. After our army's great victory in Laiwu, Shandong, the Linqing-Jinan draft was temporarily unattended, and the price was below 1,400 yuan.

　　On the other hand, the credibility of Jicha currency among the masses is increasing daily. Every time the enemy occupies one of our areas, although they try their best to suppress the value of Jicha currency and equate it with Chiang Kai-shek's currency at a ratio of 1 to 1, and order the prohibition of its circulation, the Jicha currency black market still exists, and the ratio is increasing daily. For example, at the beginning of the enemy's occupation of Bo'ai, the ratio of Jicha currency to Chiang Kai-shek's currency once dropped to 1 to 1, but later gradually rose to 1 to 5, 6, 7, or 8 yuan. According to recent news, citizens in Anyang city also prefer to use Jicha currency; Jicha currency is circulating smoothly in the local black market.

### 冀钞与蒋币一比十

　　冀钞与蒋币一比十
    【本报讯】国民党一月间发行大额新关金券后，二月中下旬又发行大额新版纸币，造成币值益跌，物价益涨。当此种新钞出现蒋区市场时，人心惶惑不安，因之刺激游资于周转股票粮食之余，又热中于盐及杂粮投机，人人愿将法币脱手，宁存货不存钱。现一般物价黑市高于市价一倍以上。据天津益世报透露，关金发行总额已达战前三十万倍，最近发行之每张五百元的新关金券（合蒋币一万元）为数亦在十万五千亿以上，每张五千元的大额蒋币，新乡等地已流通。
    和法币跌价适成对照者，为近一月内我冀钞比值及信用日形提高。当国民党颁布“紧措方案”以前，冀钞和法币比值按黑市价为一比三元五角至六元五角；至三月底止。已变为一比六元五角至十元。特别当国民党“紧措方案”颁布前后，金融市场大混乱时，高邑、赞皇一带冀钞蒋币实际比率曾达一比十二。平遥附近我区曾由一比七、八，陡涨为一比十三。此时，其他各地以法币兑冀钞都极感困难。
    此外，冀南区临清、衡水汇票价格日跌。衡水天津汇票（以万元法币为单位）在国民党实行“紧措”之初尚为二千二百元（冀钞），三月二十五日已逐步跌为一千四百元。同期内，临清津汇亦由二千二百五十元，跌为一千四百元。在山东我军莱芜大捷后，临清之济南汇票曾一时无人问津，价格则在一千四百元以下。
    另一方面，冀钞在群众中信用日高。敌人每侵占我一地之后，虽极力企图压低冀钞价值与蒋币为一比一，并勒令禁止行使，但冀钞黑市依然，且比值日高。如敌占博爱之初，冀钞蒋币比值曾降为一比一，后逐渐升为一比五、六、七、八元。最近消息，安阳城内市民亦多喜用冀钞；冀钞在该地黑市顺畅。
