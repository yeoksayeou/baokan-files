Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 8th. Our correspondent Wei Ming reports: Hu Zongnan's army's discipline is corrupt, and its crimes of disturbing and harming the people have reached an extreme. Even those within Hu Jun who still have a little conscience are extremely dissatisfied. For example, Duan Hansan, who was cultivated by Chiang and Hu, graduated from the Central Military Academy's Third Branch School, and is now a third-class pharmacist in the Thirty-first Brigade's辎重营(Zizhongying, Supply Battalion), wrote in his diary: "Yesterday (March 9th) some soldiers forcibly bought flour from the common people, even causing the old man to kneel down. Today (10th) at dawn, a rape case occurred. Four people entered a civilian's home and raped three women. The most tragic was a fifteen-year-old girl, who suffered the most trampling. This is simply banditry, how could it be the army of the nation? Although the brigade commander sent someone to 'investigate,' what will be the outcome?" On March 15th, Duan Hansan wrote in his diary again: "Under the shining bayonets of pursuit, there were pig's wails everywhere, and chickens flying in chaos. What is our performance towards the people? It is countless chickens dying under random gunfire, and countless pigs sacrificed under random knives!" By March 16th, he wrote even more: "No one says anything about arbitrarily taking civilian goods. Because of this, each of our units has had a lot of meat and other things to eat lately. My mouth is tired of eating it." Therefore, this twenty-five-year-old youth from Jiyuan County, Henan, shouted at this cruel and immoral behavior: "I can't bear it, I hate it!" He had already seen that "an army without discipline cannot fight no matter what." Sure enough, on March 25th, the Chiang-Hu army's Thirty-first Brigade, which was an enemy of the people, received its due punishment. In just two hours, the brigade headquarters and one regiment were annihilated by the Northwest People's Liberation Army.

　　Rehe-Liaoning Local Corps Advances into Eastern Rehe Behind Enemy Lines
Xinhua News Agency, Ji-Re-Liao, 5th. The Rehe-Liaoning Local Corps has now advanced into the rear of the Chiang army in eastern Rehe. On the 23rd of last month, it counterattacked the Chiang army entrenched in Kangjia mining area, 18 miles northeast of Beipiao, annihilating more than ten enemies and seizing five warhorses.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Western Manchuria, 6th. Following the victory in Mohe, Heilongjiang on the 20th of last month, a certain unit of the Democratic Allied Army completely annihilated the last remnant of the Chiang bandit Zhang Bojun's forces in the Heihe area on the 29th in Emu'er, killing, wounding and capturing more than 70 people, and more than 60 others surrendered.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Western Manchuria, 6th. Since the Democratic Allied Army entered Mohe, the northernmost part of our country, the sunshine of democracy has shone on the cold people of Mohe. At the representative meeting of all households in Quanhan River, Zhang Wujie was democratically elected as district chief, and a district government was established. Mohe is rich in placer gold, and the people mostly live by panning for gold, but there is a severe shortage of food. Except for twenty-two households with ten to twenty *xiang* of land, who are first, second, or third-class grain households, the entire district has no food. After the establishment of the democratic district government, it eliminated bandits, stopped brewing liquor, registered and controlled grain and timber, and organized the masses to exchange gold for food from Qigan, ensuring that grainless households could buy grain. At the same time, it stopped using counterfeit currency and issued agricultural loans of 300,000 yuan and loans of 150,000 yuan for hunting, logging, and gold panning to develop production, which was deeply supported by the masses.

　　胡军扰害人民受到应有膺惩
    【新华社陕北八日电】本社特派记者韦明报导：胡宗南军纪律败坏，扰民害民的罪行已发展到极点。连胡军内部还稍有良心者也极端不满。如蒋、胡一手培养，由中央军三分校毕业，现任三十一旅辎重营三等司药的段汉三，在日记上就曾这样写道：“昨天（三月九日）有士兵强买老百姓面粉，竟把老头儿弄得跪了下去。今天（十日）黎明发生了强奸案，四个人进入民家强奸了三个女子。其中一个十五岁的小女，所受蹂躏最为悲惨。这简直是土匪，那会像是国家的军队？旅长虽派人‘查’了，但又有什么下文？”三月十五日段汉三日记上又写着：“刺刀闪亮的追击下，到处是猪的悲鸣，鸡的乱飞。我们对人民的表现是什么呢？是无数鸡在乱枪下送命，是无数的猪在乱刀之下牺牲！”到三月十六日他更写道：“对民物的任意取用，没有什么人说什么话，这样我们这些时候每一单位，都有很多的肉及其他的东西吃，我的嘴吃腻了。”因此，这一个二十五岁的河南济源县的青年，对此残忍的不道德行为喊道：“我不忍，我痛恨！”他已经看到了“没有纪律的军队无论如何不能作战”。果然，三月二十五日，与民为敌的蒋胡军三十一旅，就受到了应有的膺惩。仅只两个钟头，旅部和一个团就被西北人民解放军歼灭了。
  　热辽地方兵团挺进热东敌后
    【新华社冀热辽五日电】热辽地方兵团现已挺进至热东蒋军后方，于上月二十三日反击盘踞于北票东北十八里康家矿区之蒋军，歼敌十余名，缴获战马五匹。
    【新华社西满六日电】民主联军某部，继上月二十日黑龙江之漠河胜利后，复于二十九日在额穆尔将黑河地区最后一股蒋记胡匪张伯军残部全部歼灭，计毙伤俘七十余名，其余六十余名投诚。
    【新华社西满六日电】我国北端之漠河，经民主联军进驻后，民主阳光，已经照到寒冷的漠河人民身上。在全汉河的户代表大会上，民主选出区长张武诘，成立区政府。漠河盛产沙金，人民多以淘金为生，但粮食奇缺，全区除二十二户拥有土地十垧廿垧的头二三等粮户外，皆无食粮。民主区政府成立后，即肃清胡匪，停止制酒烧锅，登记管制粮食木材，组织群众以金子从奇干换回食粮，保证无粮户能买到粮食。同时停用伪币，发放农贷三十万元及猎、木、淘金等业贷款十五万元，以发展生产，深受群众拥护。
