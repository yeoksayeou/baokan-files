　　Solve More Problems
    Unite More People
    Lucheng Fifth District Holds Cadre-Masses Unity Meeting
    [Our Newspaper, Lucheng News] After a year and a half of mass movement in the Fifth District, cadres and the masses had many conflicts, and a small number of farmers were still not mobilized. On March 17th, the district immediately convened a cadre-mass meeting for general training. In Li Village alone, more than 700 men and women (from fifteen villages) attended. Political Commissar Liu called on people to resolve conflicts and speak their minds at the meeting, and to support the masses, saying that they should say whatever they wanted. The masses were afraid that the cadres would retaliate after returning to the village and dared not raise any opinions. The cadres themselves were afraid that the masses would raise objections and felt wronged. Wang Jing, chairman of the farmers' association in Fenshang Village, only said: "Village cadres are like 'rats in a bellows, suffering from both sides.' Whether they reflect or not, they will collapse. There is no good end for being a cadre."
    After discovering the above two situations, district cadres separately convened meetings of village cadres and group leaders, proposing: Solving one more problem is uniting one more person. They also talked to the masses individually. Political Commissar Liu first made a self-criticism, saying: "I have been rough on cadres and the masses in Gaojia Village. I guarantee that I will not be rough on farmers in the future." Then the village cadres all reflected on themselves, dispelling the farmers' ideological concerns. In one day, 447 problems were solved. After the cadres and the masses solved the problems, they found the root cause of the problems. Wang Qi from Licun Gou said: "If it weren't for these cadres, how could we have overthrown the landlord Wang Maolin?" The cadres felt that they had made contributions, and the masses could not deny it. The cadres' morale was also high! Every cadre held the attitude of "correcting mistakes and making contributions." The former village chief, Guo Erzhi, said that in the future: "First, I will not be rude to the masses. Second, I will not be a hooligan. Third, I will not be corrupt. The masses are my parents. I will not be rough on the masses in the future, and I will honestly work for the masses." Li Qiuming from Linzhang Village said: "When I had conflicts with the cadres before, no matter how the cadres mobilized me, I would not join the army. Next time, I will sign up to join the army and not return home until Chiang Kai-shek is defeated."

　　多解开一个疙瘩
    多团结一个群众
    潞城五区召开干群团结大会
    【本报潞城讯】五区经过一年半的群众运动，干部与群众结下许多疙瘩，还留下小部分农民没有发动起来。三月十七日，区上即分处召干群大会，进行普训。仅李村满一处，到会者（十五个村）男女七百余人，柳政委在大会上号召解疙瘩说心思话，并给群众撑腰作主，说有什说什，群众怕干部回村报复，不敢提。干部本身怕群众提意见，觉得冤枉，坟上村农会主席王景只说：“村干部是‘老鼠进风箱里啦，两头受气’反省也垮，不反省也垮，当干部没下场。”
    发现上回两种情况后，区干部分头召集村干部与小组长会议，提出：多解一个疙瘩，就是多团结一个群众，又找群众个别谈话。柳政委首先作了自我检讨，他说：“我在高家庄碰过干部与群众，今后保证不碰农民。”接着村干部都反省了自己，打掉了农民的思想顾虑，一天即解开疙瘩四百四十七个。干群解开疙瘩后，又找见疙瘩根子，李村沟有旺妻说：“要不是这些干部，还能斗倒地主王茂林？”干部觉得自己有功，群众也昧没不了。干部情绪也高啦！每个干部都抱着“改错立功”的态度。前任村长郭二只说我今后：一、对群众不起态度。二、不流氓。三、不贪污。“群众都是自己的父母，我今后不碰群众，老老实实为群众办事。”临漳村李秋明说：“我以前和干部有疙瘩时，干部怎动员我也不去参军，下次我要报名参军，不打败蒋介石不回家。”
