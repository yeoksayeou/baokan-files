　　Troops in Southern Hebei
    Help the Masses Cultivate Land and Carry Water
    [This Dispatch from Southern Hebei, 28th] Troops in various parts of Southern Hebei are actively helping the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, as well as newly emancipated peasants, with spring plowing. The artillery battalion of the military region concentrated more than ten head of livestock to plow land and deliver manure for military families and emancipated peasants. Cadets and staff members of the Military and Political University's Fourth Detachment, numbering 155 people, with five head of livestock, helped 32 families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers and peasants without labor in the stationed village, plowing 68 mu of land, pulling 55 large carts of manure, and spreading manure over 4 large areas. After the Second Team and Fourth Squad of the Military Region Training Regiment moved to their new station, they investigated and found that one family of a martyr and two families of soldiers lacked labor, and immediately formed groups to help deliver manure and carry water. After the Weixian (County) Brigade entered the border area of Linzhang and Weixian (Counties), they actively helped with the busy farming season, implementing a "full jar" campaign. Du Fashi of the Sixth Squad carried 100 loads of water for the masses in one day, and the Second Company carried 330 loads of water for the masses in one day. The masses in the area commented one after another: "This is Chairman Mao's army, truly rare in ancient and modern times." Under the call for meritorious service, the Second Company of the Yongnian Brigade helped the masses carry water, grind flour, and spring plow, creating a enthusiastic upsurge.
