Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, April 19th: Shanghai Wenhui Daily, March 29th, reported: According to general estimates, in the past year and four months, Chiang Kai-shek, in order to carry out the civil war, has caused the 300 million people in the Chiang-controlled area to bear various war expenses amounting to 987.6 billion Chiang coins, an average of 329,200 yuan per person. According to the current price increase situation, the war expenditure this year, according to authoritative estimates, will be at least three to four times the total budget. Taking the minimum of 3 billion yuan, the people in the Chiang-controlled area, regardless of wealth or poverty, will each bear a huge sum of 100,000 yuan in war expenses.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, April 19th: According to the Ta Kung Pao, Shanghai's industry and commerce are declining due to the impact of Chiang coin inflation, and they are shrinking their scope, creating a wave of layoffs. According to incomplete statistics, in mid-March alone, more than 800 employees were laid off. The "Production Ranch" dismissed 20-30 employees, the longest serving of whom had been there for eight years and one month. The ranch sold nine old cows to use as severance pay. A certain enamel factory laid off 50 workers, each receiving only 85,000 yuan in severance pay. Moreover, the Chiang government's wage control measures have caused labor disputes in various places, and employees are demanding wage increases. Guangzhou printing workers went on strike on the 17th, and all newspapers were suspended on the 18th. Several thousand workers in various industries in Shanghai have gone on strike and petitioned.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, April 17th: Shanghai Wenhui Daily, March 20th, reported: The commercial depression in the Chiang-controlled area has affected restaurants, hotels, and other entertainment venues. Closures and layoffs are heard of every day. The famous restaurant "New Capital Hotel," after the victory, had daily business revenue of 8 million yuan, but now it has announced its closure, and more than 270 employees have suddenly become unemployed. The Jin Gu Hotel has already laid off one-third of its workers. Even the International Hotel, with its strong financial resources, has cut the music on the 14th floor. More than ten large restaurants are brewing closures. The hotel industry, after the victory, charged double the room rate and still found it difficult to find an empty room. Now, those who can sell 50% of their rooms are considered to have a booming business. Ballroom business has plummeted. The Xianlesi and Paramount ballrooms only earn 6-7 million yuan a night. However, the number of dance hostesses has increased in inverse proportion. Taking the medium-sized ballroom "Venus" as an example, the number of dance hostesses has increased to more than 120. Shanghai's "prosperity" has truly become a thing of the past.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, April 19th: Shanghai Ta Kung Pao, April 14th, reported: People in the Chiang-controlled area, driven by the need for survival, are taking risks. In the first half of March, Shanghai had a total of 53 robbery cases, an average of 4.3 cases per day; 868 theft cases, an average of 70 cases per day.

    蒋区人民负担战费沉重
    商业凋敝解雇风潮迭起
    【新华社陕北十九日电】沪文汇报三月二十九日讯：据一般估计，过去一年四个月中，蒋介石为了进行内战，已使蒋管区三万万人民负担各色战费达蒋币九十八万七千六百亿元，平均每人负担三十二万九千二百元。按照目前物价上涨情况，则今年战费的支出，据权威估计，最少为总预算的三倍至四倍，以最低限度三十亿元计算，则蒋管区人民无论贫富，每人又将负担战费十万元之巨款。
    【新华社陕北十九日电】据大公报讯：上海工商业受蒋币膨胀影响，日趋衰落，纷纷紧缩范围，已造成解雇风潮。据不完全统计：仅三月中旬，被解雇职工已达八百名以上。“生产牧场”遣散职工二三十名，其中服务年限最长者为八年一个月。该场变卖老牛九条，以充作遣散费。某搪瓷厂解雇工人五十名，每人仅发解雇费八万五千元。又蒋政府之统制工资措施已引起各地劳资纠纷，职工纷纷要求加薪。广州印刷工人于十七日全体罢工，十八日各报均告停刊。上海各业罢工请愿工人已达数千名。
    【新华社陕北十七日电】三月二十日沪文汇报讯：蒋管区内商业凋敝已影响及餐厅旅馆及其他娱乐场所之商业，关门解雇者日有所闻。著名餐厅“新都饭店”胜利后，每日营业收入达八百万元，而今已宣告关门，二百七十余职工顿告失业。金谷饭店已裁减工人三分之一。即资力雄厚之国际饭店，已将十四楼之音乐裁减。尚留有十余家大餐厅正酝酿关门。旅馆业在胜利后以双倍房价，尚难于找到空房，今能卖出五成房子者，已算生意兴隆。舞厅营业已一落千丈，仙乐斯百乐门一夜所得也仅六七百万元。但舞女却成反比例增加。以中等舞厅“维纳斯”而论，舞女竟增至一百二十余名，上海之“繁荣”实已成过去。
    【新华社陕北十九日电】沪大公报十四日讯：蒋管区人民为生活所迫者，均挺而走险。三月上半月上海共发生盗案五十三件，平均每日四、三起；窃案八百六十八件，平均每日七十起。
