[This report was transmitted from Taiyue on the 22nd by our newspaper] The directly subordinate organs of the Taiyue Administrative Office resolutely returned cultivated land to the masses, helped the masses to completely turn over, and strengthened the relationship between the government and the people. Last year, the Administrative Office itself cultivated 143 mu of land belonging to the masses. Except for retaining 3 mu for growing vegetables as rent, all the rest was returned to the masses. The Second Farm cultivated 69 mu of dry and irrigated land in Pingtoushan Village and other villages last year. This year, only 11.2 mu are retained as experimental fields, and the remainder are also returned to the masses. The houses occupied by the farm and shops in ×× West Street are all returned or rented.
