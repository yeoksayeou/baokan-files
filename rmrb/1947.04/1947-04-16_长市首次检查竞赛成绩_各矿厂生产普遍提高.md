Changzhi City's First Inspection of Competition Results
　　Production Universally Improved in All Mines and Factories

[Report from our Changzhi City office] The Changzhi City Production Increase Competition Inspection Committee, along with more than 40 Party, government, and labor union cadres, began its first movement inspection on March 25th and completed it on the 31st. It proved: First, the movement was comprehensive. From managers to workers, miscellaneous personnel, cooks, and grooms, and over 90% of the city's employees, all formulated their own production and conservation plans. For example, Manager Li of the Jia Zhang Mine formulated a personal "Progress Plan" and then went down the mine every ten days to pull a cart for eight hours, which powerfully promoted the movement. The personal plans of all employees mainly focused on improving skills, transforming ideology, respecting teachers and loving apprentices, practicing strict economy, and improving quality and quantity. The inspection results also proved that the vast majority of personal plans were completed and even exceeded. Based on this, the plans formulated by various departments and factories were also realized. Second, the production enthusiasm of all employees was unprecedented. Workers and staff of the Hua Feng Iron Factory worked 14 to 15 hours a day to complete 20 new-style vehicles before May 1st. Third, the development of the movement, under the new leadership method of the mass line, was greatly different from last year in terms of speed, scale, and appearance, with the following six characteristics: (1) A mass ideological examination was conducted. Taking Jia Zhang as an example, 78 problems, large and small, were resolved, thereby making the relationship between labor and management, political work personnel, employees, teachers and apprentices, and new and old workers unprecedentedly harmonious and united. Through this movement, the ideological awareness of employees was greatly improved, truly achieving labor-management cooperation, workers managing the mine, and giving full play to the initiative and sense of responsibility of labor in the posture of masters. At the same time, administrative work has also taken a big step forward, more clearly clarifying the leadership method of the mass line. (2) In carrying out the movement, the first thing to do is to put forward a clear political slogan, which powerfully moved the heart of every employee, carry out revolutionary friendship competitions, and make the movement enthusiastically move towards a universal climax. (3) This year's movement is not only for workers, but a comprehensive movement. In addition to their own work, managers and staff participate in actual labor and learn production technology. In coal mines, cadres and staff go down the mine to pull carts, and almost all of them have learned to drive high-capacity carts. (4) The formulation of plans is conscious and comprehensive, and personal plans are written by hand. (5) Implement voluntary combination of teachers and apprentices. Under the principle of voluntary combination, respect for teachers and love for apprentices are unfolded, making the relationship between teachers and apprentices unprecedentedly consolidated and close. Encouraged by the new heroism in the movement, many masters hope that their apprentices can stand alone. (6) To make achievements, to produce more, and to save money, personal plans from top to bottom have specific amounts of monthly savings, and managers, staff, and workers do not smoke paper cigarettes. The bomb factory saved more than 41,000 kilograms of millet in a year. After Hua Feng completed the installation of the machines, the administration used 30,000 yuan as a bonus, but all the staff did not want it and sent it to the front. Fourth, after research, all committee cadres pointed out: (1) Continue to improve the movement and strictly prevent complacency. (2) Strengthen current affairs education, class education must be combined with actual production. (3) When labor is exerted to a high degree, pay attention to protecting labor and promoting creation. (4) In order to further improve the movement and enable the wide exchange of experience and technology to achieve mutual assistance and learning, each factory should independently select objects and organize employee visit groups to visit.
