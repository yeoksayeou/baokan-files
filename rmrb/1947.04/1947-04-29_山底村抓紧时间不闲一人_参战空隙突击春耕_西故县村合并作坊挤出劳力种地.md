　　Shantou Village Seizes Time, No One Idle
　　Taking Advantage of Breaks in Combat to Rush Spring Plowing
　　Xiguxian Village Merges Workshops, Squeezing Out Labor to Plant Land

　　[Our newspaper, Lucheng News] Shantou Village in the Third District participated in the joint defense zone meeting held in Baotou Village on April 1st. In order to overcome the difficulty of a lack of labor for spring plowing, the leadership proposed seizing the opportunity before participating in combat to rush to complete the three tasks of turning over fallow land, delivering manure, and harrowing. After discussion, everyone unanimously recognized that a person participating in combat at home for one day could do more than a semi-laborer for several days. We must break the phenomenon of people waiting at home to participate in combat without moving, and everyone must move. Each village made a specific plan for how many days it would take to complete the task based on the amount of fallow land and the amount of labor and animal power in their village, and went back to lead the rush. Shantou Village has 1,726 mu of autumn land and 611 mu of wheat land. Last year, there were 247.5 mu of fallow land that had not been turned over, and the manure was still at home and had not been delivered. The autumn land needed to be harrowed once, and the plan required 14 days to complete. After the meeting, a village-wide cadre and mass meeting was convened that night to discuss how to proceed. After discussion and research, it was unanimously agreed that there were only two ways to plant the land well: (1) Before participating in combat, while the labor force is at home, help each other to rush to work, do one day as one day, to overcome the difficulties in spring plowing. (2) After participating in combat, the whole village will implement a major labor exchange, and women and children will also be organized to work. At that time, a woman named Hao Xiance said, "Don't be afraid, you go to participate in combat, we women will organize ourselves, cooperate with the male laborers at home, plant when we should plant, hoe when we should hoe, and guarantee that no land will be barren." Then everyone unanimously proposed the slogan: "Early to bed, early to rise, three lights; late to bed, late to rise, three wastelands; the clumsy bird flies first." At that time, everyone said in unison: "Yes, it won't work if we don't do this, let's start rushing together before participating in combat." At that time, the cadres also participated in mutual aid and led the work. In this way, everyone was very enthusiastic. The original plan was to complete the three tasks of turning over fallow land, delivering manure, and harrowing in 14 days, but as a result, the plan was completed in only 10 days. In addition, 86 mu of sesame were also planted, 120 mu of land prepared for planting Jin Huanghou jade corn were also prepared, and 65 mu of cotton land were also prepared, which laid a good foundation for the planting work.

　　[Our newspaper, Changzhi News] Xiguxian Village has 233 households, with a current population of 797, and 3,097 mu of land. There are 104 full laborers, with each laborer planting an average of more than 28 mu of land. This spring, the masses lack confidence in production, and the accumulated fertilizer is not being moved. They are waiting to plant with the long stubble. Most of the masses reflect that there is a shortage of manpower this year, so they will just plow the long stubble and plant it, without expecting a large harvest. Based on this situation, we discussed in the people's school how to overcome the difficulties of having a lot of land and a small labor force. In the small group deliberation, it was proposed that three women are equal to one worker, women with bound feet can sow seeds and spread fertilizer, and women with big feet can drive carts to deliver fertilizer, with the slogan "No one who can move is idle." The masses also proposed that there are 14 small production workshops in the village, occupying 40 laborers, and some labor can be squeezed out from here to participate in the spring plowing of the land. As a result of the discussion, the 14 small workshops and cooperatives were merged into nine according to their nature, reducing the number of people operating them to 17, freeing up 23 people to participate in agricultural production. After such organization and rectification, the whole village organized 80 women to assist in labor and go to the land for production, and 23 male laborers participated in agricultural production, doubling the labor force of the whole village. The masses' confidence in production has been improved, and they want to achieve plowing, harrowing, and rolling, without leaving a single mu of stubble land. (Tian Ye)

　　[Our newspaper, Pingshun News] After the militiamen and stretchers of Beishe Village in the Fifth District set out to participate in combat, in order to overcome the labor difficulties, it was calculated that the whole village had a total of 13 she (large and small cooperatives) and 11 workshops (flour mills, machine workshops, etc.), occupying 55 full male laborers. After discussion by the cadres and masses, these laborers were drawn out to participate in spring plowing. Each she only kept one accountant, and even the street stall vendors were organized to take time off to go to the fields, and all the auxiliary labor in the village was organized. After doing this, the production enthusiasm of the whole village soared. In four or five days, all the cotton fields were prepared, and other autumn lands are also being plowed. Auxiliary labor is specifically hoeing wheat, and some women are also carrying water. (Jiang Wen)

　　山底村抓紧时间不闲一人
    参战空隙突击春耕       
    西故县村合并作坊挤出劳力种地
    【本报潞城讯】三区山底村，四月一日参加在堡头村召开的联防区会议，领导上为了克服春耕劳力缺乏的困难，提出趁着参战未走，抓紧机会突击完成垡茬地、送粪、耙地三项任务，经过讨论，都一致认识参战人在家干一天就顶半劳力干好几天，一定得把在家单等参战不动弹的现象打破，都动起来才行。各村按本村茬地多少，劳畜力多少，具体订出几天能完成任务的计划，分头回村领导突击。山底全村有秋地一千七百二十六亩，麦地六百十一亩，在去年没有垡下的茬地二四七·五亩，粪还都在家没送出去，秋地要全部耙一遍，计划须用十四天时间才能完成，开罢会，当夜回来就召开全村干部和群众大会，讨论如何进行。经讨论研究，一致认为想把地种好，只有两个办法：（一）在参战未走以前，趁劳力都在家，互助起来突击搞，做一天算一天，以此克服春耕中的困难。（二）参战走了，全村实行大变工，把妇女儿童亦都组织起来干。当时妇女郝先则说：“不怕，你们参战走吧，我们妇女组织起来，配合在家的男劳力，该种就种，该锄就锄，保证不荒一亩地。”接着大家一致提出：“早起三光，迟起三荒，笨鸟先飞”的口号，当时大家都异口同声的说：“对，非这样就不行，在参战未走前一齐下手突击。”当时干部亦都分工参加了互助，领导干起来。这样一来，大家劲头很大，原计划十四天完成茬地送粪耙地三项任务，结果只用了十天功夫就完成了计划，除此以外，还种了八十六亩芝麻，把一百二十亩准备种金皇后玉茭的地亦收拾现成了，六十五亩棉花地亦收拾好了，这样给下种工作打下了很好的基础。（魏辅晋、赵保则、桑科则）
    【本报长治讯】西故县全村二百三十三户，现有人七百九十七口，土地三千零九十七亩，全劳力一百零四个，每个劳力平均种地廿八亩多，今春群众生产没信心，堆的肥料也不搬啦，长着茬就等下种。大部分群众反映今年人手缺，长茬刨刨种上就算啦，不用指望多收。根据这种情况，就在民校讨论怎样克服地多，劳力少的困难。在小组酝酿中提出了三个女人顶一工，小脚点种撒粪，大脚赶车送粪，“不闲一个能动人”的口号。群众又提出村中有十四个小型生产作坊，占去四十个劳力，从这里能挤出一部分劳力参加地的春耕。讨论结果把十四个小型作坊合作社按性质合并成九个，减至十七个人经营，腾出二十三人参加农业生产，经过这样组织与整顿，全村组织起八十个妇女辅助劳力上地生产，二十三个男劳力参加农业生产，全村劳动力增加一倍。群众的生产信心提高了，要做到耕一耙一耢一，不留一亩茬地。（田野）
    【本报平顺讯】五区北社村参战民兵担架出发后，为了克服劳力困难，计算了全村共有十三社（大小合作社），十一坊（粉坊机坊等），占据了男全劳动力五十五个，当经干部群众讨论，把这些劳力抽出来，参加春耕，每社只留会计一人，街上摆小摊的也组织起来抽空下地，把全村所有的辅助劳力都组织起来。经这样一做，全村生产情绪顿形高涨，在四、五天内就把全部棉花地准备妥当，其他秋地亦正在犁，辅助劳力专门锄麦，有的妇女还挑水。（讲文）
