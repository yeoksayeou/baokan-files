　　Day and Night Processing Supports the Front Lines
　　A Certain Unit's Cartography Department Launches a Competition
　　[This Newspaper's Report] In order to meet the needs of the Patriotic Self-Defense War, the Cartography Department of a certain unit began a drawing practice competition as early as the beginning of February. Eighteen male and female comrades who volunteered from Peking University and the Military University quickly mastered the technology in a short month of business learning and participated in the shock work. The shock month started on March 17th and ended on April 17th. After general mobilization by the leadership, everyone proposed abolishing Sunday holidays, reducing unnecessary meetings, seizing time, ensuring 12 hours of work time per day, and voluntarily working overtime at night. During the shock month, every comrade's mood was exceptionally full, and they demonstrated a high degree of initiative and creativity. For example, Comrade Shen Jian used a straight ruler to type, connecting the pen and ruler to write horizontal and vertical square characters quickly and well, replacing and reducing the role of the brush. Comrade Yuan Xiao used a steel pen tip ground into a small knife to finely dig and correct the finished product. These small creations really helped a lot in the progress and quality improvement of the work.

　　日夜加工支援前线
    某部制图科开展竞赛
    【本报讯】为了适应爱国自卫战争的需要，某部制图科远在二月初便进入绘制练习竞赛运动。从北大、军大志愿来的十八个男女同志，在短短一个月业务学习中，很快的掌握了技术，并参加了突击。突击月由三月十七日开始至四月十七日止。领导上一般动员后，大家纷纷提出废除星期日例假，缩减不必要的会议，抓紧时间，保证每日十二小时的工作时间，并自愿自动加夜工。突击月中，每个同志的情绪都异常饱满，并发挥了高度的积极性与创造性。如申健同志用直尺打字，将钢笔与尺子联系一起，写成横平竖直方形体，又快又好，代替和减少了毛笔的作用。元晓同志用钢笔尖磨成小刀以精致的挖补校正了成品。这些微小创造给以工作进展和质量提高上确实帮助很大。
