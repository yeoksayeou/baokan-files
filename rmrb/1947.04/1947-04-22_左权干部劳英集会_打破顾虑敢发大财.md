    Zuquan Cadre Labor Hero Assembly
    Breaking Concerns, Daring to Make a Fortune
    [This newspaper, Zuoquan] On April 7th, Zuoquan convened a conference of 800 people, including cadres from all counties, districts, and villages, as well as hero model workers, to conduct ideological mobilization for large-scale production. During several days of group discussions at the conference, a common problem was discovered: the issue of the future of production. The biggest concern was the fear of being labeled as "exploiters" and being liquidated like landlords in the future, leading to a reluctance to get rich and the emergence of the mentality of "contentment with poverty." Zhang Tong, the village head of Aikou Village, said, "I dare to make a small fortune, but not a big fortune, because I can't bear the label of 'exploitation.' In the future, I would be treated the same as the landlords. So, I would rather cultivate less land than plan to hire long-term laborers, because hiring long-term laborers directly exploits people and grows a feudal tail, which will have to be cut off in the future. Therefore, it is better to do less to avoid future troubles?" This problem was only resolved after a great debate. Chen Yuhe from Qilidian said, "I work in the paper mill to serve the masses of the whole village. My family's land needs to hire a long-term laborer to cultivate it. Although there is some exploitation, it is beneficial to both parties. I don't think it can be regarded as feudal exploitation, so I am not afraid of having my tail cut off." Then everyone clamored, "That's right, as long as it's not feudal, we're not afraid of being cut off. In the future, don't think wildly. It's right to concentrate on getting rich, otherwise, we will fall behind in the new society." The concern about getting rich was resolved, and it was clarified that the employer-employee relationship after the land reform was mutually beneficial, not feudal exploitation like in the old society. Immediately afterward, the question of "how to get rich" was discussed. As a result of the discussions, actual experience in recent years has proven that the direction of getting rich is the close combination of agriculture and sideline occupations. If either aspect is neglected, the goal of getting rich will not be achieved. Furthermore, it is also very important to cultivate more special crops in agriculture. For example, Wang Xuilai, the village head of Xihuangzhang Village, said, "I have now become a new rich peasant. The main reason is that I am willing to work hard, but the reason I have become rich so quickly is that I have grown hemp. Last year, I grew four mu of hemp and peeled 900 jin of hemp skin, and also harvested 4 shi and 7 dou of hemp seeds, which can be exchanged for 47 shi of corn, which is more than 16 shi more than my annual grain harvest. It is really profitable." Liang Yuanqing, the village head of Lianggou Village, also said, "In the winter of 1943, I raised a sow, which gave birth to three litters of piglets in a year, earning 60,000 yuan (including selling the old sow), and bought a good mule, which can not only cultivate the land but also transport goods, so my family has become rich. I plan to do better in the future, not only to cultivate the land well, but also to grasp raising pigs and transporting goods." From this, everyone clearly understood that a good combination of agriculture and sideline occupations is the road to getting rich. (Yin Long)

    左权干部劳英集会
    打破顾虑敢发大财
    【本报左权讯】左权于四月七号召开了全县区村干部及英雄能手八百人的大会，进行大生产思想动员，在几天大会小组讨论中，发现一个普遍性的问题，就是生产的前途问题，最大顾虑是怕戴上了“剥削”帽子，将来也和地主一样被清算，以至不敢发财产生圪瘩户思想。隘峪口村长张通说：“我是敢发小财，不敢发大财，原因是担不动‘剥削’两字，所以宁愿少种些地，也不计划雇长工，因为雇上长工便直接剥削了人，长起了封建尾巴，那将来还不是要割掉；如此，还不如少闹点，省的将来麻烦？”“这个问题经过了一番大争论才算弄通，如七里店陈玉和说：“我在纸厂做工给全村群众服务，家里土地要雇个长工养种，虽有点剥削，但是双方有利，我觉得不能当做封建剥削，所以我也就不怕割我的尾巴。”接着大家都嚷着说：“这样可对了，只要不是封建就不怕割，以后可不要糊思乱想了，一心闹发家是正经事，不然就会在新社会里掉队。”解决了怕发财的顾虑，明确了实现土地改革后的主雇关系是双方有利的，不是旧社会的封建剥削。紧接着便讨论“怎样才能发财”的问题，扯的结果，几年来实际经验，证明发家的方向是农副业密切结合，如果忽视任何一方面，都不会达到发家的目的，再就是农业上多种特种作物也很重要。如西黄漳村长王雪来说：“我现在升成个新富农了，主要原因是我肯劳动，但发的这样快就是多种了麻，去年种了四亩就剥了九百斤麻皮，还打下四石七斗麻籽，变成钱就能买四十七石玉茭，比我全年收的粮还多出十六石，真是够利大。”梁沟村长梁元庆也说：“我四三年冬天喂了一口母猪，一年生了三窝小猪，就赚了六万元（连卖老母猪），买下个好骡子，不但能种地，还能运输，所以我家就闹的发起来了，我计划今后闹的更好些，不但种好地，养猪运输也一定要抓紧。”从此大家明确了农副业结合好，就是发家的道路。（印龙）
