    A Salute to District and Village Cadres
    Recognizing Meritorious Service, Improving Work Style, and Strengthening Unity Between Cadres and the Masses
    In the eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan and the two years of the Patriotic Self-Defense War, our Party established great achievements for the Chinese people in the struggle for national liberation, democratic freedom, and land reform. Tracing back to the source, the district and village cadres deserve the greatest credit for completing this great task. The foundation of all work lies in the village, and all our work must be realized through the district and village cadres. In Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu, we have over one million district and village cadres. They are directly connected with the masses. The Party, through them, implements its various policies; through them, it unites all the peasants. In ten years of revolutionary struggle, the district and village cadres have done incalculable meritorious service for the people. In the struggle against the enemy, they led the masses in anti-mopping-up operations, evacuations, building people's armed forces, and persisting in guerrilla warfare; they led the masses in expanding the army, giving preferential treatment to families of soldiers, collecting public grain, and completing reasonable burdens; they led the masses in fighting locusts, providing disaster relief, weathering famine years, and engaging in the great production movement; they led the masses in the double reduction and the struggle to suppress traitors and liquidate accounts. Since last year, they have also led the masses in land reform, realizing "land to the tiller." In the great Patriotic Self-Defense War, they have already made indelible achievements and continue to build meritorious service for the people. In carrying out their work and completing their tasks, they work day and night, self-sufficiently, and selflessly for the public. Among them, there are many outstanding Party members and model cadres, and many have heroically sacrificed themselves in the struggle against the enemy. All the million district and village cadres in the entire area have shared weal and woe with the people, enduring hardship and working tirelessly, heroically struggling through ten years full of difficulties, creating countless moving and exemplary achievements. And now they are still leading the masses in supporting the front lines, carrying out land reform, and engaging in the great production movement. They are truly wholeheartedly serving the people. Therefore, they are supported and loved by the masses. All the million district and village cadres in the entire area are revolutionary heroes and founding veterans. Such titles are well deserved for them. At this time of intense self-defense war, the imminent end of land reform, and the arrival of the great production movement, we extend our warm salute and sincere greetings to all our million district and village cadres in the entire area, and call on you to win victory after victory and add merit upon merit.

    The merits of the district and village cadres are certain. The cause they have created and completed is great. They are all the most outstanding elements in the people's ranks. However, in their tense revolutionary work, in their undertaking where achievements and merits occupy a thorough and complete position, some problems and shortcomings have also occurred, such as an undemocratic work style, administrative orders, taking credit for oneself, being arrogant and complacent, and occupying too much of the people's fruits. These problems and shortcomings are not small and are factual. Because they have worked hard to serve the masses and establish meritorious service, they have won the love and support of the broad masses; and because of these problems, the masses have expressed dissatisfaction in their support and revealed disappointment in their love. District and village cadres are in danger of becoming separated from the masses, and the relationship between cadres and the masses is not good. This is a major problem that urgently needs to be resolved. (1) The problem must be solved; (2) the method must be carefully considered and cannot be handled carelessly.

    Why do district and village cadres have these problems and shortcomings? How should we understand this issue? What attitude and method should we adopt to solve this problem? These problems and shortcomings of district and village cadres are brought about by achievements and merits. The reason for these errors is due to the traditional influence of feudal society on the peasants for many years; district and village cadres have family burdens and a low level of awareness, thus becoming arrogant and complacent due to their merits; and the leadership has failed to correct their errors and educate them in time to improve their thinking. This kind of error is produced under certain social and historical conditions. In the great land reform and Patriotic Self-Defense War, it is almost inevitable. This is a mass social problem, not a problem of whether a certain individual is good or bad. It should not be seen as the essence of district and village cadres being bad or having already turned bad, but rather as their misfortune. We should regret them and give them infinite sympathy. You are the meritorious officials of the people. Why did you unfortunately commit these small faults? What a pity! When dealing with this issue, we must have correct policies, attitudes, and methods. A careless or historically disconnected approach is called lacking a mass perspective, or having insufficient mass perspective. In the historical records of our base areas, there have been two policies and two work lines for dealing with this issue in history: One is to simply criticize shortcomings and errors, casually punish cadres, replace cadres in large numbers, oppose new nobles, oppose new bullies, and treat them as criminals of the revolution, completely wiping out the cadres' merits and advantages, not valuing the cadres' history and political life, and only using punishment to stimulate work. It does not look at the problem from a historical and social method, and does not believe that the vast majority of district and village cadres can correct their mistakes and do good, continue to establish meritorious service for the people, and regain the support of the masses. This method cannot transform the work style of district and village cadres, and cannot solve the ideological problems of district and village cadres and the masses, and of course, it cannot improve the relationship between cadres and the masses, let alone promote work. This is a wrong work line. However, the enforcement of discipline under certain periods and certain conditions is absolutely necessary and permissible. The other work line is to commend achievements, advantages, merits, and models, promote good typical figures and creations to guide work, and overcome shortcomings. Commending the good is to promote righteousness and suppress evil. When the positive factors within the masses are promoted, they can overcome negative factors. Good models can become a new direction for work. Acknowledging and commending their merits and achievements can inspire and motivate cadres to win victory after victory and add merit upon merit. It will enlighten cadres to reflect on their errors and shortcomings and correct their faults. This method has been tried and tested in various regions. This is precisely adopting an attitude of responsibility towards cadres, cultivating education, and the policy of curing diseases and saving people. It is not to kick cadres who have made mistakes when they are down, but to give them infinite sympathy and love. Their errors and shortcomings are our errors and shortcomings. If we cannot correct their errors and shortcomings and cannot completely educate them, we should feel uneasy and always keep it in our hearts, feeling that we have failed the people and the cadres, feeling that a major matter has not been completed, and we must spare no effort and exhaust all means to strive to educate this group of cadres so that they can continue to establish meritorious service for the people.

    It must be understood that the contradiction between district and village cadres and the masses today is a contradiction within the revolutionary camp. It has a fundamental difference from the contradiction between peasants and landlords and cannot be confused. For contradictions within our own camp, we should adopt the policy of narrowing, mediating, and educating to resolve them. This is the principle. If, as mentioned above, the first work line is universally implemented, it will definitely expand the shortcomings and errors of district and village cadres, increase the estrangement between cadres and the masses, and solve the internal contradictions of the peasants as if they were contradictions between peasants and landlords. It will打击 [dǎjī - strike, hit, attack, crack down on] the emotions of district and village cadres and will not improve the relationship between cadres and the masses. The result will be to make loved ones suffer and enemies rejoice, allowing the landlord class to take advantage of it. This is a line of lifting a stone to hit one's own feet. Conversely, the second work line, which corrects errors and shortcomings by praising merits and models, can open up the minds of cadres, encourage them to win victory after victory and add merit upon merit, and can improve the emotions of cadres, narrow and eliminate the疙瘩 [gēda - lump in one's heart] between cadres and the masses. Facts have proven that once cadres reflect on and admit their mistakes, the masses will immediately support the cadres again.

    Various regions in our area are combining the return of excessively occupied fruits with the work of transforming and improving the work style of district and village cadres and improving the relationship between cadres and the masses. Various regions have created many good experiences. The experience of many places proves that: first, convene a meeting of district and village cadres separately, recall ten years of revolutionary work, and point out that district and village cadres have made many contributions to the people and have all made meritorious contributions. Then, start with cadres comparing merits and setting examples, comparing who has made the greatest contributions and who is the model. The leaders will then commend and reward the model Party members and model cadres to encourage the emotions of the district and village cadres. Model Party members and cadres become the goals and directions that the broad cadres should learn from. Under the mass inspiration, they will naturally embark on reflection and self-criticism, reflecting on their various shortcomings until they return the fruits they have excessively occupied. And the masses will everywhere publicize the merits of the cadres. As long as they correct their mistakes, they will still support them to be cadres and lead the revolution. This will not打击 [dǎjī - strike, hit, attack, crack down on] and reduce the emotions of the active elements of the district and village cadres, but will instead make their revolutionary emotions even higher and their spirits even happier. The best example is the experience of the Wu Xiang Model Party Member Congress. They used the method of praising advantages to transform shortcomings. On the basis of affirming the merits of Party members, they let Party members embark on self-examination. Everyone talked about their revolutionary history and revolutionary merits, and they were all beaming and felt as if they were on the scene, feeling supremely glorious. In the process of comparing merits, many model Party members' model achievements, correct thinking, noble qualities, and lofty integrity were compared, becoming good teaching materials and good examples for educating Party members. Therefore, everyone looked to the model Party members, compared themselves, and as a result, enlightened Party member cadres to cherish their merits and history and improved their willingness to examine their shortcomings. As a result, even the Party members and cadres with the biggest problems were transformed well. Such typical creations should be promoted in various regions. Another example is that the Seventh Prefectural Committee of Ji-Lu-Yu proved this truth in launching the anti-bureaucratism movement. They initially simply criticized and打击 [dǎjī - strike, hit, attack, crack down on] the bad ones, but it did not work. So, in the process of exploration, they launched the movement to establish meritorious service and set examples. As a result, the cadres more thoroughly overcame bureaucratism and the work style of being detached from the masses. Many people, due to the praise of their merits, felt even more that their past contributions to the people were insufficient and that violating the interests of the people was wrong, leading to self-reproach, even to the point of tears. These are all very good proofs.

    Currently, various regions in our area are carrying out a large-scale production movement on the basis of land reform. Various regions should coordinate the movement to commend meritorious service and set examples for district and village cadres to achieve unity between cadres and the masses, and after the victory of land reform, achieve another victory in the large-scale production movement.

    向区村干部致敬
    立功表模、改善作风、干群团结
    在八年抗战、两年爱国自卫战争中，我党在争取民族解放、民主自由和土地改革的斗争中，为中国人民建立了伟大功勋。追本溯源，完成这一伟大任务，区村干部功劳最大。一切工作的基础在于村，我们的任何工作都要通过区村干部，才能实现。我晋冀鲁豫有一百万以上的区村干部，他们是直接与群众相联系，党经过他们，实现党的各种政策，经过他们，团结全体农民，十年革命斗争，区村干部为人民做了不可计算的功劳，在对敌斗争中，他们领导群众进行过反扫荡、转移、建设人民武装和坚持游击战争，他们领导群众进行过扩兵、优抗、屯集公粮、完成合理负担的工作；他们领导群众进行过打蝗、救灾、渡过荒年，以及大生产运动；他们领导群众进行过双减、反奸清算斗争；去年以来他们又领导群众进行过土地改革，实现了耕者有其田；在伟大的爱国自卫战争中，又领导群众已经做下不可磨灭的业绩，并继续为人民建功立业。他们在进行工作完成任务时，每天都是日以继夜、自供自给、舍己为公的紧张的工作着，其中有许多优秀党员、模范干部，且已在对敌斗争中英勇奋斗地牺牲了。全区百万区村干部，都是与人民同甘苦共患难，任劳任怨，英勇奋斗渡过了困难重重的十年，创造了无数的可歌可泣的模范业绩，并且现在他们仍在领导群众进行支援前线、土地改革及大生产运动，真是赤胆忠心为人民服务。因此他们是为群众所拥护、所爱戴的。全区百万区村干部，都是革命功臣，开国元勋，这样的称呼对他们是受之无愧的。在此自卫战争紧张，土地改革将要结束，大生产运动已经来临之际，谨向我全区百万区村干部致以热烈的敬礼和亲切的慰问，并号召你们胜了再胜、功上加功。
    区村干部的功劳是肯定的，他们所创造完成的事业是伟大的，他们都是人民队伍中间的最优秀分子。但他们在紧张的革命工作中，在彻头彻尾是成绩和功劳占有的事业中，也发生了一些毛病和缺点，如作风不民主，行政命令，功臣自居，骄傲老大，多占人民果实等。这些毛病和缺点并不很小，都是事实。由于他们努力给群众服务，建功立业，取得了广大群众的热爱和拥护；又由于有了这些毛病，群众对他们在拥护中发生不满，热爱中吐露失望；区村干部有脱离群众的危险，干部与群众关系不好，这是目前急待解决的一个重大问题。（一）问题必须解决，（二）方式必须讲求，不能草率从事。
    区村干部为什么会发生这些毛病和缺点呢？我们应该怎样认识这一问题呢？应该采取什么态度和方式解决这一问题呢？区村干部这些毛病和缺点是成绩和功劳中带来的毛病和缺点，发生这些错误的原因，是由于多年来封建社会所加于农民的传统影响；区村干部有家庭负累，觉悟程度不高，因而恃功骄矜；以及领导上未能及时的纠正其错误，加以教育，以提高其思想；这种错误，是在一定的社会历史条件下所产生的。在伟大的土地改革和爱国自卫战争中，差不多是不可避免的，这是一个群众性社会性的问题，不是某一个人的好坏问题，不应该把他看成是区村干部本质不好，或已经变坏，而是应看成是他们的不幸，我们应当惋惜他们，给以无限的同情，你们是人民的功臣呀，为什么不幸的犯有这一点点毛病呢？真可惜呀！处理这一问题时，必须有正确的政策、态度和方法，草率从事或割断历史的处理办法，叫做没有群众观点，或群众观点不足。在我们根据地历史的记录中，对这个问题的处理，历史上存在着两种政策和两条工作路线：一条是单纯的批评缺点错误，随便处分干部，大批撤换干部，反新贵，反新恶霸，把他们看成革命的罪人似的，一笔抹杀干部的功绩和优点，不宝贵干部的历史和政治生命，专门用处罚以刺激工作，不是历史的社会的方法去看问题，不相信广大区村干部均能改过迁善，继续为人民立功，重新获得群众拥护，这种办法是不能改造区村干部作风，是解决不了区村干部和群众的思想问题的，当然也不能改善了干部和群众的关系，更谈不上推动工作，这是错误的工作路线。但在一定时期一定条件下的执行纪律，则完全必要和许可的。另一条工作路线是表扬成绩、优点、功劳和模范，发扬好的典型人物和创造，以指导工作，克服缺点，表扬好的就是提正气压邪气，群众内部的积极因素发扬起来，就能克服消极因素，好的典型就能成为一种新的工作方向，承认表扬其功劳和成绩，就可以鼓舞推动干部胜了再胜，功上加功，就会启发干部反省错误缺点，纠正毛病，这个方法，已在各区百试百验，这正是采取对干部负责态度、培养教育、治病救人的方针。不是干部犯了错误，落井下石，而是对他们寄予无限的同情和爱护，他们的错误缺点，就是我们的错误缺点，如果不能改正他们的错误缺点，不能把他们完全教育过来，我们就应寝食不安，时常挂在心上，觉着这是对不起人民和干部，觉着有一件大事未了，一定要费尽一切力量，想尽一切办法，争取教育这一批干部，使其继续为人民建功立业。
    必须了解，今天区村干部与群众之间的矛盾，是革命阵营内部的矛盾，它和农民与地主之间的矛盾有根本区别，不能混为一谈。对自己阵营内部的矛盾，要采取缩小调解教育的方针来解决，这是原则。如果如上所述，照第一条工作路线普遍执行，就一定会扩大区村干部的缺点与错误，增加干部与群众之间的隔阂，把农民内部矛盾当成了农民与地主的矛盾一样去解决，就会打击了区村干部的情绪，改善不了干部与群众的关系，结果会使亲痛仇快，使地主阶级从中利用，这是搬起石头打自己足的路线。反之，第二条工作路线，是在表功表模中改正错误和缺点，可以打通干部思想，鼓励其胜了再胜、功上加功，可以使干部情绪提高，缩小与消灭干部与群众之间的圪瘩，事实证明，一经干部反省承认错误，群众就立即会重新拥护干部的。
    我区各地正在结合退出多占果实，进行改造提高区村干部的作风和改善干部与群众之间的关系的工作，各地创造了很多好的经验。许多地方经验证明：首先单独召集区村干部会议，回忆十年革命工作，指出区村干部为人民立了很多功，都是有功劳的。跟着就从干部比功表模开始，比出谁的功大，谁是模范，对模范党员、模范干部，由领导上再加以表扬奖励，以鼓舞区村干部情绪，模范党员和干部成为广大干部应当学习的目标和方向，在群众性的启发下，便很自然的走上反省和自我批评，反省自己各种缺点，直至退出多占果实为止。而群众则到处宣传干部功劳，只要改正错误，仍拥护他们当干部，领导革命，这不但不会打击和降低区村干部积极分子的情绪，反而革命情绪会更加高涨，精神会更加愉快。最好的例子是：武乡模范党员大会的经验，他们用表扬优点的方法改造缺点，在肯定党员功劳的基础上，让党员走上自我检讨，每个人谈到自己的革命历史与革命功劳时，都是眉飞色舞，如临其境，觉得自己无上光荣，在比功的过程中，比出许多模范党员的模范业绩，正确思想，崇高品质和高尚气节，成为教育党员的好教材和好榜样，于是大家就向模范党员看齐，对照自己，结果启发了党员干部宝贵自己功劳和历史，提高了自己检讨缺点的自愿性，于是连毛病最大的党员和干部都改造得好了。这样典型的创造，各地应加发扬。又一例子是冀鲁豫七地委在发动反官僚主义运动中证明这一真理，他们开始单纯的批评打击坏的，结果走不通，于是在摸索中开展了立功表模运动，结果干部反而更加彻底的克服了官僚主义与脱离群众的作风，许多人由于表扬功劳，反更加感觉过去为人民立功不够和违背人民利益是不对的，引导到反躬自责，以至于流泪，这都是很好的证明。
    目前，我区各地正在土地改革的基础上，开展大生产运动，各地均应配合对区村干部的表功表模运动，达到干部与群众团结一致，在土地改革胜利之后，再来一个大生产运动的胜利。
