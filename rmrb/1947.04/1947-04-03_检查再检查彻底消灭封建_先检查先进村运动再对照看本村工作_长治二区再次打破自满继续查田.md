　　Check and Re-check to Thoroughly Eliminate Feudalism
    First Check the Advanced Village Movement, Then Compare with the Work of Our Own Village
    Changzhi Second District Breaks Complacency Again and Continues Land Investigation
    [Report from our newspaper in Changzhi] In order to carry out the continued land investigation, the Second District of Changzhi convened a meeting of more than 500 village cadres and activists on March 20. In order to reverse the cadres' complacent thinking that they had "almost" completed the rectification and should quickly focus on production, they first discovered problems by examining the work of the advanced village of Sudian Town. At the mobilization meeting, they called on everyone to find relatives, acquaintances, and confidants to ask questions and find problems. That night, comrades such as Cao Linshui moved their bedding to live in relatives' homes to ask questions. In one night, they discovered many problems. For example, the Guan Zhaoze family of seven originally farmed one mu of land before liberation. After liberation, in the anti-traitor and debt-clearing movement, they were allocated six mu of land, averaging one mu per person. The Zhao Suoze family of three originally farmed two mu of land. In the course of turning over, they were allocated 2.9 mu of land, most of which was fragmented and poor land. Zhao Suoze once told the village cadres, "I was allocated too little!" The cadres said, "Because you have the labor to produce, you won't be allocated more." Tu Baocheng's family of three originally farmed more than seven mu of land and was allocated more than 30 mu of good land (mostly irrigated land), as well as seven mu of garden land and more than 30 rooms. Jia Nvze, one person, was allocated 26 mu of dry land and four mu of garden land. The family of martyr Du Shunze of seven people did not have quilts, and seven people still shared three tattered quilts. In addition, landlord Guan Jinquan used relatives to hide land. For example, Wang Quan of Nantianhe gave him a false opinion, and the landlord gave him three mu of land and three rooms. This was just for saying a word. At this time, Wang Quan had not yet obtained the land and was still preserving it in the home of the landlord's brother-in-law, Tianbao... At this time, comrades such as Cao Linshui realized that there were still problems such as unfair distribution of fruits, landlords hiding land, fake struggles, and rigid cadre work styles. From practical education, everyone realized that further land investigation was still necessary.
    In order to further enlighten village cadres and activists, clarify the importance of land investigation, and overcome complacency, small group discussions were held the next morning and morning. On the one hand, they analyzed the work of Sudian, and on the other hand, they checked whether their own village had similar problems. Only the villages of Yuanjia Zhuang, Xinyi, and Songjia Zhuang roughly estimated a few landlords and found that they had hidden more than 80 mu of land, most of which had been given to poor peasants and hired laborers last year out of fear of struggle. One village in Beitianhe found 17 mu of land, six rooms, and three bases. After discovering the above problems, a general forum was held to first find the reasons for the existence of so many problems in Sudian. Some said: The main reason is that the cadres do not care about the masses; some said that although the cadres are selfish, the masses are not aware; finally, Jia Tianbao of Xijia Village said: "Sudian's work has shortcomings, and we cannot only blame the cadres. The main reason is that the landlords are highly skilled, using false struggles to buy off and sabotage. The cadres' mistake is only looking down on backward masses. The masses are not wrong. Once the cadres are divorced from the masses, it leaves loopholes for the landlords to exploit. This problem not only exists in Sudian, but also in our village. You think, when we are cadres in the village, the masses avoid us when they see us and discuss us in secret. I think there are many problems in our village." After his speech, everyone unanimously clarified that the main reason was the landlords' conspiracies and sabotage; secondly, the cadres' complacency and failure to go deep into the masses. Finally, Comrade Zhang Hanqing, who helped Sudian's work, made a self-reflection; he said: "I have been working in Sudian for more than two years. In the past six months, because I was not at ease with my work, I was perfunctorily doing my job. However, when attending meetings in the district, I only wanted to say good things and was unwilling to report bad things. After getting married last year, I spent more time planning for my wife and less time caring about the masses. I am also a farmer who turned over with four mu of land, but I forgot the masses." He cried, and many people in the audience cried along with him. Immediately afterwards, Comrade Wang, the secretary, said: "I worked in Sudian for a month and did not encounter a mass who said a word of their thoughts like they did to the comrades. The main reason is that I have been working in the circle of cadres. But it should be said that we have achieved results. It can be said that we have basically eliminated the landlords, and there are still 'backward' masses who have not been fully mobilized. This is mainly due to the landlords' conspiracies, and another reason is that the cadres do not go deep into the masses, and complacency is also a reason. I ask everyone a question, is Sudian the only one like this? Are there still problems in other villages?!" Everyone shouted in unison: "Yes! There are many more!" He then said: "Then are we going to continue the land investigation or engage in production?" Everyone shouted: "Continue the land investigation!" Finally, unanimously under the slogan of "If feudalism is not eliminated, the movement will not stop, and the movement will be combined with production", "Everyone unties the knots, unties the knots for great unity, vents the anger, speaks their minds, is not afraid of retaliation, and is not afraid of mistakes", they rushed to their posts overnight. And organized ten district cadres and village cadres to carry out work in backward villages, striving for a balanced work throughout the district.

　　检查再检查彻底消灭封建
    先检查先进村运动再对照看本村工作
    长治二区再次打破自满继续查田
    【本报长治讯】长治二区为开展继续查田，于三月二十日召开了全区五百多个村干部和积极分子会议，为了扭转干部翻身“差不多”，赶快搞生产的自满思想，便首先通过检查先进村苏店镇的工作，来发现问题。在动员大会上号召大家找亲戚、熟人、相好访心话，找问题，当夜就有曹林水等同志，搬上铺盖住在亲戚家里访心话，一夜内，便发现了许多问题。如：关招则家七口人，解放前原种一亩地，解放后在反奸清债运动中分了六亩地，现在每人合一亩地。赵锁则家三口人，原种二亩地，在翻身当中分了二亩九分地，大部还是星碎孬地。赵锁则曾告诉村干部说：“我分的少”！干部说：“因为你有劳力能生产，不多分给。”秃保成三口人，原种七亩多地，又分得了三十多亩好地（大多数是过水地），还有七亩园地，三十多间房。贾女则一个人分了二十六亩旱地，四亩园地。抗属杜顺则家七口人，没被盖，现在还是七个人伙盖三条破被。此外地主关金全利用亲戚，把地埋伏了，如南天河王全给他提了个假意见，地主就给了三亩地三间房，这只是说了句话，这时王全还没得上地，仍然在地主小舅子天保家保存着……。这时曹林水等同志才了解到还存在着分配果实不公，地主埋藏土地，假斗争，干部作风生硬等问题，从实际教育中大家认识到进一步查田还是很必要的。
    为了进一步启发村干部和积极分子，明确查田的重要性，克服自满起见，第二天早上和上午就进行了小组的酝酿，一方面分析苏店工作，一方面连系检查本村有没有同样的问题。仅原家庄、信义、宋家庄三个村粗搬指头算了几家地主，就查出埋藏土地八十多亩，多半是去年怕斗争送给贫农和雇工的。北天河一个村就查出十七亩地，六间房，三个基地。发现以上许多问题后，就举行了大会座谈，首先找苏店存在这样多问题的原因。有的说：主要是怨干部不关心群众；有的说干部虽自私，但群众也不觉悟；最后西贾村贾天保说：“苏店工作有缺点，不能光怨干部，主要是地主手腕高，利用假斗收买捣鬼，干部的错误只是看不起落后群众，群众没什么错，干部一脱离群众，给地主留下了可钻的空子，这个问题不但苏店有，就我村也有。你想咱在村当干部，群众见了咱避讳，在背地议论，我想我村问题可多哩。”经过他这样的发言，大家才一致明确了主要是地主阴谋大在捣鬼；其次是干部思想自满不深入群众。最后帮助苏店工作的张汉清同志作了自我反省；他说：“我在苏店二年多了，最近半年由于工作不安心，在工作中是肤皮了草的支应公事，但是在区开会时，我却光想说个好，不愿汇报坏的。去年结婚以后，给老婆打算的时候多了，关心群众就少了。我也是四亩地翻了身的农民，但是忘了群众。”他哭了，全场随着哭的很多。紧接着分书王同志说：“我在苏店工作了一月，没有遇到一个群众像对同志们那样说出一句心思话。主要原因是老在干部圈子里打转。但是应该说我们是有成绩的，可以说：基本上消灭了地主，还有“落后”群众未充分的发动，这主要是地主的阴谋，另外是干部不深入群众，自满也是一个原因。我问大家一句话，光苏店是这样？其他村也还有问题！？”大家齐声说：“有！还多着哩！”他又说：“那么咱们是继续查田，还是搞生产哩？”大家高呼：“继续查田！”最后一致“在封建不消灭运动不停止，运动结合搞生产”。“大家解圪塔，解开圪塔大团结，出闷气，说心话，不怕报复，不怕差（错）”的口号下，搭夜赶到工作岗位上去。并组织了十个区干部和村干部，开展落后村工作，争取全区工作的平衡。（保库、岷山、林堂）
