Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 8th—Farmers on both sides of the Shu River in the Binhai region, behind Chiang Kai-shek's army, are combining labor and military affairs to rush the spring planting. The river's western joint defense militia persist in their struggle by dispersing during the day and gathering at night, using any free time to cultivate the land. When militiamen from a certain village are spreading fertilizer, they carry rifles and landmines with them to cope with any situation. The masses in the bordering areas use carts to haul all their grain and furniture to the fields. If there is no trouble, they work hard to cultivate the land; if there is trouble, they immediately harness the carts and move. In a certain village near the east bank of the Shu River, although Chiang Kai-shek's "Homecoming Corps" harasses them several times a day, the militia's armed resistance has enabled the village to cultivate one-third of its more than 1,200 mu of land. Eighty percent of the relocated masses from more than fifty villages in the Peach Garden area have returned to their villages for spring planting. The masses in Banjiaguanzhuang and the eighteen refugee households who moved there are helping each other with the urgent spring planting. They cultivate the land in their own village during the day and move to the enemy-occupied areas at night to help the refugees with the urgent spring planting, cultivating eighty-four mu in three days.

　　滨海沭河两岸农民
    劳武结合互助抢耕
    【新华社山东八日电】滨海蒋军后方之沭河两岸农民，劳武结合抢耕。河西联防民兵以日散夜聚方式，坚持斗争，抽暇种地。某庄民兵推粪时，将步枪地雷随身携带，以便应付情况。边沿群众把全家粮食家具用大车拉到地里，没有情况就全力耕作，有情况即套车而行。靠近沭河东岸之某村，虽蒋军“还乡团”一日数搔，但在民兵武装坚持下，全村一千二百余亩地已耕完三分之一。桃园区五十余村之转移群众，百分之八十已回村春耕。斑家官庄群众与迁来之十八户难胞，互助抢耕，白天在本村耕，夜晚转移敌占区，帮助难胞抢耕，三天抢耕了八十四亩。
