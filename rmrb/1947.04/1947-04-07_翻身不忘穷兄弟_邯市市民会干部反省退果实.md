　　Not Forgetting Poor Brothers After Turning Over
　　Handan City Residents' Association Cadres Reflect and Return Gains
　　[Our Newspaper] Comrade Zhang Linyu, director of the Beimenli Residents' Association in Handan, not only led the masses in pouring out grievances during this filling-in movement but also took the lead in returning the over-allocated gains. He said resentfully at the residents' grievance meeting: "I came from a poor family since childhood and worked as a servant for others at the age of thirteen, and as an apprentice in a coal mine at sixteen. During famine years, my family couldn't make ends meet, so I asked someone to borrow money from my uncle (a landlord) and mortgaged three mu of garden land. At first, it was small amounts like three or five yuan, but over time, I ended up giving him the three mu of garden land. In the thirty-second year, I still had no choice but to plead with my uncle, spending his money three or five yuan at a time, and finally mortgaged my house to him, forcing myself to live in a small temple. I kept thinking, when will I ever have a good life? The Eighth Route Army liberated Handan the year before last, and I took the lead in fighting the old monk of Dingjue Temple (a villain). I was extremely happy in my heart during the struggle, thinking that the skies had finally cleared, determined to overthrow the evil landlords and work for the poor. During the struggle, I saw two foreign cloth quilts that were soft and shiny, and I thought I had never covered myself with anything like that in my life. At this moment, I forgot the masses and secretly took them home. When fighting Zhang Chunshan, I saw some good clothes and furniture, and I privately divided them with a few leading comrades. I took a total of more than thirty items, big and small. I thought our contributions were great, and I should get a larger share for taking the lead, forgetting about serving the masses. After fighting the traitor Ji Weiping, when auctioning off the spoils, I saw a waterwheel, and I made another mistake, buying it cheaply with money. After receiving four days of training in the district this time during the filling-in, I realized that everything I had done in the past was wrong. I struggled in my mind several times, and finally made up my mind to confess and return the gains..." This action greatly influenced other village cadres. Comrades Zhang Shichang, Zhang Weilin, Wu Yongchang, and others also rushed to return the excess gains and cheaply bought items from the past. After the village cadres returned the over-allocated gains, the enthusiasm of the masses was very high. The cadres also swore to serve the masses to the end. From then on, the relationship between the cadres and the masses in Beimenli became even more united.

　　[Our Newspaper] Zhao Sanxiao of Beikongtan Village in Anze corrected his mistakes on the spot and returned the over-allocated gains. Comrade Zhao Sanxiao had a bad work style in the past and was detached from the masses. He received too much spoils from the struggle during last year's mass movement. After the call for "land to the tiller" was put forward this year, he went through a lot of ideological struggle and finally figured it out. At the meeting, he very kindly admitted to the masses that his past work style was not good, that he was selfish and self-serving, and that he would do a good job for the masses in the future, soliciting opinions from everyone, and returned seven mu of good riverside land and three rooms of a building on the spot. The masses everywhere said, "Support good cadres who are selfless and impartial."

　　翻身不忘穷兄弟
  　邯市市民会干部反省退果实
    【本报讯】邯郸北门里市民会主任张林玉同志，在这次填补运动当中，不但带领群众诉苦，并带头退出多分的果实。他在市民诉苦大会上怨愤的说：“我自幼家穷，十三岁给人家当差，十六岁到煤矿当学徒。灾荒年家里顾不住，便托人给我伯父（地主）借钱，并以三亩园地作押，先是三块五块的零支，日久积累，终久把三亩园给了他。三十二年还是没办法，又给我伯父说好话，三块五块的使了人家钱，最后把房子又当给他，自己被迫住了小庙。我整天想，什么时候才能过好时光。前年八路军解放邯郸，我领头斗争定觉寺的老和尚（恶徒），在斗争时自己心中高兴的了不得，以为可晴了天啦，抱定决心，要把恶霸地主斗垮，为穷人办事。斗争时看见有两条洋布被子又绒又光，心里想一辈子也没盖过，这时忘了群众，便偷拿到自己家里。斗张春山时，看到些好衣服、好家具，又和少数的带头同志私自分了。我拿的共计大小三十余件。我以为我们的功劳大，我带头就应当多分，自己也不说为群众服务了。斗汉奸冀卫屏后，拍卖果实时，看见水车，自己又犯了毛病，拿钱贱买了。这次填补开始，我在区上受了四天训，了解到自己过去都是不对，在脑子里作了好几次斗争，最后才下了决心坦白退果实……”这一行动大大影响到其他村干，张世昌、张维林、吴永昌等同志，亦争先恐后的将过去多得果实，和贱买的东西退出来。村干退出多分的果实后，群众情绪非常高涨，干部并宣誓为群众服务到底，从此北门里的干群关系进一步的团结。

    【本报讯】安泽北孔滩村赵三小，当场改正错误，退出多得果实，赵三小同志过去作风不好，脱离群众，去年群运中多得了斗争果实，在今年提出耕者有其田的号召后，它经过了不少的思想斗争，最后想通了。在大会上很和霭的向群众承认了自己过去作风不好，自私自利，今后好好给群众办事，征求大家给他提意见，并当场退出多得果实，好河滩地七亩，楼房三间，群众到处说：“拥护大公无私的好干部。”
