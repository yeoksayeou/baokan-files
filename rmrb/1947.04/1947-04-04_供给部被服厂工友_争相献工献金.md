The Workers of the Supply Department Clothing Factory
    Compete to Dedicate Labor and Money
    [This Newspaper] Under the general policy of rendering meritorious service to the people, the Second Clothing Factory of the Military Region Supply Department launched a production competition campaign in early March. Thanks to the efforts of all employees, there has been significant progress in both output and quality. Concurrent with this movement, the factory also launched a wave of dedicating labor, money, and practicing thrift. A group of youth from the "One Society, One Group," influenced by the thrift of the staff, first proposed a competition with the staff, volunteering their labor to make one hundred sets of military uniforms. When Group Nine heard this news, they immediately caught up, offering all of their actual February wages (equivalent to the labor cost of 580 sets of military uniforms). Other groups were unwilling to fall behind, so they competed to dedicate 100 sets, then 50 sets. After timely commendation on the blackboard newspaper, it immediately caused a sensation throughout the factory and among every employee. Tailoring worker Chang Guicheng, in addition to the entire group dedicating their labor to make 500 sets of military uniforms, personally dedicated his labor to make 100 sets. As of the 26th, the more than ten workers in the tailoring group had dedicated their labor to make a total of 600 sets, equivalent to 281.2 kilograms of rice. The workers in the machine work groups, numbering ××, dedicated their labor to make a total of 1,130 sets, equivalent to 3,672.5 kilograms of rice. When the dyeing workers saw the above situation, they held a discussion late at night (meetings could not be held during the day due to busy work schedules). The entire group unanimously agreed to dedicate one day's labor, calculated as wages equivalent to 1,500 kilograms of rice. Furthermore, Hu Jin'an, Wen Kui, Jia Zhenxiang, Wang Jiaji, Zhang Dezhen, Wang Lishen, Ji Lanchi, and others contributed a total of 68,000 yuan. Comparing the number of people in each group, the dyeing workers' dedication of labor ranked first in the entire factory. The staff's thrift campaign had already been launched earlier, which greatly encouraged the workers' movement to dedicate labor and money. According to the statistics of 22 comrades: they saved 854 kilograms of rice from subsidies (including technical subsidies), 9 cotton hats, 5 and a half cotton-padded clothes, 4 single hats, 1 single upper garment, 6 single trousers, 26 pairs of shoes, 8 pairs of socks, 31 towels, 68 and a half bars of soap, 35 packages of tooth powder, 30 toothbrushes, and 26 tubes of toothpaste.

    [Furthermore] After the call to "Defend the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region and Defend Chairman Mao" was issued, all the workers of the First Clothing Factory of the Military Region Supply Department, in addition to rushing to make military uniforms day and night to support the front lines through processing, also launched a wave of donating money. Veteran worker Shi Ying fired the first shot, donating 12,000 yuan of his savings, followed by Wang Baolin, who had just been liberated from the Shangdang Campaign the year before last, donating 10,000 yuan. After everyone heard about Shi and Wang's generous donations, they competed to donate money, ranging from 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. In addition to donating their small savings from their spare-time production, the staff constantly had people saving their entire year's subsidy rice at the same time. As of the 24th, 210,000 yuan and 2,000 kilograms of millet had been donated. (Yu Qian)
    [This Newspaper, Zuoquan] Li Zhenjiang, a demobilized soldier from Zuoquan, saw in the newspaper that the leaders were practicing thrift and that Jiang's bandits were mobilizing troops to attack the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region again. He was extremely angry and wanted to go to the front lines, but his health was poor. After thinking about it, he decided not to collect his son's supply grain for a year and a half, totaling 47,000 yuan, and asked that it be quickly transferred to the front lines. The county government commended him for this. (Hao Jimin)
