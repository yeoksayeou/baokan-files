　　The reporter visited the Taihang慰劳团 at the front lines and asked them to talk about their impressions of working at the front.
　　The troops' warm welcome made them extremely excited. The troops regarded them as family members, and everyone shouted, "The family members are here!" They used the best items to entertain them everywhere. The troops liked them to talk about the situation in the rear. They told the soldiers that the government not only helped the families of soldiers solve their living problems, but also helped them to become rich. After hearing this, the soldiers in the base area immediately replied: "We will work harder in the future." The liberated soldiers were extremely envious and said, "After the war, I will also go to Taihang Mountain." They brought more than 10,000慰劳 letters. Among all the慰劳 items, this was the most popular. Most of these were family letters. The family members specifically told the soldiers how much land and property they had been allocated, and how the problems of carrying water and chopping firewood were solved, etc. The troops regarded these letters as teaching materials, which greatly stimulated everyone's emotions. The director of the political department of a certain unit said: "With these letters, we will definitely fight better in the future." What excited the "family members" the most was the great progress made by the troops in the half-year self-defense war. Guo Nanzhi of the Political Department of the Taihang Military Region said: Our team has completely changed. He said that, for example, a certain regiment, originally a guerrilla unit from Ci County, fought such a beautiful Dayang Lake battle in such a large-scale mobile warfare. Especially in terms of weapons, they were very surprised by the sophistication and neatness of the equipment. There has also been great improvement in political work. There is now a wealth of experience in how to quickly transform liberated soldiers and quickly improve the skills of new soldiers. There is mutual assistance in combat; mutual assistance in marching during peacetime; and mutual assistance in thinking; this is a complete set of mass political work. It has solved many problems that could not be solved. Wang Keqin is a typical example. Yan Bingyu, a comrade from the Taihang Administrative Office, said: After returning, we must take better care of the families of soldiers, and check from village to village in order to better help the families of soldiers become rich. We must write more letters to the troops, complete the land reform more thoroughly, and work harder to step up production to achieve three years of farming with one year of surplus.

　　太行慰劳团在前线
    沈容
    记者在前线拜访太行慰劳团，请他们谈谈在前方工作的观感。
    部队对他们热烈的欢迎，使他们兴奋极了，部队把他们看作娘家人，大家都嚷着说：“娘家人来了。”到处用最好的物品来招待他们，部队最喜欢他们讲后方的情形。他们告诉战士们，政府不仅帮助军属解决了生活问题，而且要帮助军属发家致富。根据地的战士听后立即回答说：“以后更要好好干了。”解放战士羡慕之至，都说：“打完仗我也到太行山去。”他们带来一万多封慰劳信，在一切慰劳品中这是最受欢迎的，这些大部分是家信，家里人具体的告诉战士，分到了多少地，多少资财，以及担水、砍柴问题是怎样解决的等等，部队把这些信当作教材，大大地激励了大家的情绪，某部的政治部主任说：“有了这些信，我们以后一定打得更漂亮。”最使“娘家人”兴奋的，是部队在半年自卫战争中有了极大的进步。太行军区政治部的郭南枝说：我们的队伍已经完全改观了。他说譬如某团，原来是磁县的游击队，在这样大规模的运动战中打了那样漂亮的大杨湖之战，尤其在武器方面，现在装备之精良和整齐使他们大吃一惊，政治工作方面也有了很大改进。怎样迅速改造解放战士，迅速提高新战士的技术，现在都有极丰富的经验。作战有作战互助；平时有行军互助；思想互助；这是一套完整的群众性政治工作。解决了很多不能解决的困难。王克勤就是一个典型的例子。太行行署的延炳钰同志说：回去以后一定要更好的照顾军属，要挨村挨户检查，以便更好帮助军属发家致富，一定要多写信给部队，要更彻底的完成土地改革；更努力加紧生产，做到耕三余一。
