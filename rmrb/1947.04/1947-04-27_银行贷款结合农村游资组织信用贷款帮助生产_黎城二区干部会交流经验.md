　　Bank Loans Combined with Rural Idle Funds to Organize Credit Loans to Help Production
    Licheng Second District Cadre Meeting Exchanges Experiences
    [This newspaper, Licheng News] The Second District convened an enlarged meeting of village cadres and activists in mid-April to discuss issues such as removing obstacles to prosperity and carrying out large-scale production; and also discussed how to use cooperative organizations to absorb rural idle funds through loans, and strengthen credit business activities. At the meeting, Li Jiakui, the director of the Beiliu Cooperative (a first-class cooperative hero of Taihang), introduced his village's experience in credit activities: They once organized 500,000 yuan of idle funds for deposits within a month, and loaned out more than 1 million yuan (combined with 300,000 yuan in bank loans), helping the masses buy 13 head of livestock. Liu Bingwu, the director of civil education in the village, said: "Our village has been very convenient since we had a credit department. If we don't have enough money to buy livestock, we can withdraw it from the credit department. Especially for the impoverished households, who were allocated livestock but didn't have saddles, or had livestock but no farming tools, they could get loans." Zhou Xi'e, chairman of the Women's Federation, said: "The credit department is also very good to our women. We can put the money we don't need from small factories into it, which can earn interest and help production. We can deposit and withdraw at any time, which is very convenient." At this time, someone raised the question: "It's good to establish a credit department, but I'm afraid no one will deposit money. Now the masses are more discerning, and they don't care about the small interest of one or two thousandths." Shen Hekui, manager of the Dongbei Cooperative, said: "Our village can do it. From the first month of the year until now, transportation alone has earned more than 2.6 million yuan. Now the cooperative is lending money to buy livestock. If we establish a credit department, we can save the money we earn every day, which will not be wasted, and we can take turns buying livestock. The main thing is to be trustworthy." Someone else asked: "What if the masses can't repay the loans?" The director of the Beiliu Cooperative said: "This has also happened in our village. Later, we held a meeting of loan recipients to discuss the matter. Everyone realized that the main purpose of the credit department's loans is to help us with production, and we can't treat it the same way we treated the former landlords' accounts. Later, the loans were gradually repaid when they were due." After this, everyone understood, and the villages of Renzhuang, Dongbei, Xiacun, and Tinghepu proposed to establish credit departments, and the remaining cooperatives also agreed to increase credit business. The bank is also preparing to issue a loan to help establish credit business. (@Tian)
    [Also Reported] In the Great Production Campaign, the Licheng Branch of the Jinnan Bank has increased agricultural and handicraft loans by 11.5 million yuan to solve the financial difficulties of livestock and farm implements. The focus of the loans is to help newly liberated households solve the difficulties of livestock and farm implements. In order to ensure that the loans play their due role, they are generally distributed through the village cooperatives with a relatively solid foundation, so that the cooperatives can absorb idle funds through loans and enliven rural credit activities. Now the branch staff have taken the loans to the fourth, fifth, and sixth districts to distribute them personally. (Changgui)

　　银行贷款结合农村游资组织信用贷款帮助生产
    黎城二区干部会交流经验
    【本报黎城讯】二区四月中召开各村干部积极分子扩大会，除讨论解除发家障碍进行大生产等问题外；并讨论了如何使贷款通过合作社组织吸收农村游资，加强信用业务活动的问题。在会上北流合作社社长李甲奎（太行一等合作英雄）介绍了他村信用活动的经验：他们曾在一个月内组织游资吸收存款五十万元，贷出款一百余万元（结合银行贷款三十万元），帮助群众买了牲口十三头。该村民教主任刘丙午说：“俺村自从有了信用部，很活便，买牲口钱不够，到信用部就能抽出来，特别是圪道户（赤贫）分到牲口，没鞍架，有牲口、没农具，都能贷到。”妇救主席周喜娥说：“信用部对俺妇女也很好，小型工厂不用的钱就放到里边，能得利，还帮助了生产，随存随取，很方便。”此时又有人提出：“成立信用部好，但就怕没人存款，现在群众眼大了，千二八百利钱看不起来。”董北合作社经理申河魁说：“俺村就能行，从正月到现在光运输就赚了二百六十多万元，现在买牲口款不够都是合作社给借。如成立信用部，每天赚下的存起来，就浪费不了，又能轮流买牲口，主要是讲信用就行。”又有人提出：“群众贷上款还不了怎办？”北流合作社长说：“俺村也发生过，后来召开了一个贷户会讨论，大家才认识了信用部贷款主要是帮助咱生产，不能和对待从前债主放账一样，后来到期贷款就都陆续归还了。”这一来大家都想通了，当时就有仁庄、董北、下村、停河铺等村提意成立信用部，其余的合作社也纷纷同意增加信用业务。银行并准备发放贷款一部帮助建立信用业务。（＠田）
    【又讯】冀南银行黎城支行在开展大生产运动中，解决畜力农具等资金困难，特增发农业手工业贷款一千一百五十万元。放款重点主要是帮助新翻身户解决畜力与农具等困难。为了使贷款起到应有的作用，一般通过比较有基础的村合作社进行发放、使合作社通过贷款，吸收游资，活泼农村信用活动。现支行业务员已携贷款亲自到四、五、六区发放。（长桂）
