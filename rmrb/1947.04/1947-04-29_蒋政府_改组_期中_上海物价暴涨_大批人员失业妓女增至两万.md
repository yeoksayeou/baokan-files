Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 25th—Shanghai's commodity prices seem to be deliberately joking with Chiang Kai-shek's "reorganized government." Chiang Kai-shek announced the "reorganization of the government" on the 18th, and Chiang's "new government" officially debuted on the 23rd. These six days were a period of new major fluctuations in Shanghai's commodity prices. An Associated Press dispatch from Shanghai on the 23rd stated: Shanghai's commodity prices have reached a new peak, rising by 20 to 50 percent in the past week. The week mentioned by the Associated Press coincides with the time when the Chiang government was reorganized. According to Singapore Broadcasting, on the 23rd, the price of rice in Shanghai was 220,000 yuan per picul, the black market price of gold was 780,000 yuan, and the black market price of US dollars was 18,000 yuan (official price was 12,000 yuan). An Associated Press report on the 24th stated: The black market price of gold has reached 1.1 million yuan, and the black market price of US dollars has risen to 22,000 yuan. The Associated Press said: The price of flour has risen by 50 percent, and it is difficult to say what the black market is. Because speculators operate under the greatest secrecy, and such speculators, apart from Chiang, Soong, Kong, Chen, and the government-affiliated financial cliques themselves, cannot be found elsewhere in China. The people's lack of illusion about the Chiang government's "reorganization" can also be seen from the commodity prices in Shanghai. The Shanghai Wenhui Daily was severely warned by the Chiang's police bureau on the 24th for publishing the black market price of gold. It was also stated: "If there is any further violation in the future, the responsible editor of the newspaper will be detained." This shows the panic of the Chiang Kai-shek clique.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 27th—The recent rapid rise in Shanghai's commodity prices poses a major threat to people's lives and causes unrest, first arousing repercussions among the working class. The system of calculating wages based on the January price index is being demanded by workers to be abolished, as they cannot have their wages frozen at the January level. According to the Associated Press, the black market exchange rate has risen to 23,000 to one, an increase of 1,000 compared to the 24th, and the price of rice on the 25th was 250,000 yuan per picul. The Central News Agency also believes the situation is serious, stating that the rice price "continues to skyrocket and seems uncontrollable."

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 22nd—Shanghai reports: Chiang Kai-shek's economic controls have caused a large number of layoffs. According to general estimates, the number of unemployed in Shanghai has increased from 1.6 million last year to 2 million, with an average of one in every two or three people unemployed. The number of prostitutes in Shanghai has increased to 20,000. According to statistics from December last year, there were more than 180,000 unemployed people in Chongqing, and the unemployment problem in Zhejiang is also very serious. In Hangzhou alone, more than 30,000 machine workers and silk reeling workers are unemployed.

### 蒋政府“改组”期中  上海物价暴涨  大批人员失业妓女增至两万

　　蒋政府“改组”期中
    上海物价暴涨
    大批人员失业妓女增至两万
    【新华社陕北二十五日电】上海的物价似乎故意同蒋介石的“改组政府”开玩笑，蒋介石于十八日宣布“改组政府”，到二十三日蒋记“新政府”正式登台，前后六天，但这六天就是上海物价发生新的大波动的日子。美联社上海二十三日电称：上海物价达到新的最高峰，过去一周中上涨为百分之二十到五十。美联社所说的一周，恰恰就是蒋政府改组的时候。据新加坡广播称：二十三日上海米价为每石二十二万元，黄金黑市为七十八万元，美金黑市为一万八千元（官价一万二千元）。美联社二十四日的报导：黄金黑市已达一百一十万，美金黑市已上涨至二万二千元了。美联社说：面粉上涨百分之五十，很难说到底是什么黑市。因为投机者在最大秘密下进行，这样的投机者除了蒋宋孔陈和政府系财阀自己以外，在中国是找不出别人来的。人民对蒋政府的“改组”毫无幻想，亦可从上海物价中透视出来。上海文汇报二十四日因刊载了黄金黑市价格，遭蒋记警局严重警告。并谓：“嗣后如再违犯，定予该报负责编辑拘留处分。”这可以看出蒋介石集团的恐慌。
    【新华社陕北二十七日电】上海物价近来飞速上涨，给人民生活以重大威胁不安，首先在工人阶层中激起反响。以一月物价指数为基础计算工资之制度，工人们要求取消，不能将工人工资老是冻结于一月份的水平线上。又据美联社称：外汇黑市已涨至二万三千比一，较二十四日又涨一千，二十五日米价为每石二十五万元。中央社也认为形势严重称：米价“继续飞涨似无法控制”。
    【新华社陕北二十二日电】沪报讯：蒋介石的经济管制已造成大批人员失业。据一般估计，目前上海无业失业者已由去年一百六十万增至二百万，平均每二三个人中即有一人失业。上海妓女已增至二万人。据去年十二月份统计，重庆失业者已达十八万余人，浙江失业问题，也很严重。仅杭州市机器工人，缫丝工人失业者即达三万以上。
