Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, April 12th, TASS, The Hague: Prominent Indonesian journalist Yusuf Oudadale recently wrote in the "Wasi" newspaper: "During the Japanese occupation, thousands of Indonesian soldiers helped the Allied countries resist Japan, deeply believing that the collapse of fascism would bring them freedom. In this struggle, more than 10,000 Indonesians sacrificed their lives. However, British and Dutch troops ignored these facts and attacked Indonesia. The Indonesian People's Army was forced to resist the modern British and Dutch armies in order to defend freedom." The journalist continued, "In the Battle of Surabaya, the youth displayed heroic miracles. The British army only entered the city by using tanks and bombs. However, the Indonesian Republic, despite the blockade and constant threats of war, has victoriously completed the organization of the rear. Now, the orders of the Republic government still prevail within its territory. Hundreds of newspapers are now published, and many parties and trade unions are freely developing on a democratic basis. The Indonesian Republic desires to establish close relations with all freedom-loving countries."
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, April 10th, TASS, The Hague: The Hague newspapers reported that Dutch Labor Party member of parliament Bola, at a press conference, condemned the Netherlands for continuing to send troops to Indonesia, declaring that this action violated the Dutch-Indonesian agreement. At a meeting hosted by the Labor Party in Amsterdam, Indonesian party member Sharido delivered a speech stating: "There are now more than 100,000 Dutch troops with modern equipment stationed in Indonesia. Why send another 2,000? The fact proves that the Indonesian Republic is capable of maintaining order and peace. Dutch troops there can only cause chaos. We declare that Indonesia does not need foreign troops on its territory."

    【新华社陕北十二日电】塔斯社海牙讯：印度尼西亚名记者约苏夫奥达达莱，最近在《瓦希报》上著文称：“在日本占领期间，数千印尼战士帮助盟国反抗日本，他们深信法西斯主义的崩溃将会带给他们自由，在这个斗争中，一万余印尼人牺牲了。但是英、荷军队，却不管这些事实，竟向印尼进攻。印尼人民军队为了保卫自由，被迫抵抗现代化的英何军队”。该记者继称：“在保卫撒拉巴亚之役，青年们表现了英勇的奇迹，英军只有靠使用坦克和炸弹才进了城，但印尼共和国不顾封锁和不断的战争威吓，依然胜利的完成了后方组织，现在共和国政府的命令仍然通行于领土之内。现在已有几百种报纸出版，许多党派和职工会都在民主基础上自由发展。印尼共和国渴望和一切爱好自由的国家建立亲密的关系。”
