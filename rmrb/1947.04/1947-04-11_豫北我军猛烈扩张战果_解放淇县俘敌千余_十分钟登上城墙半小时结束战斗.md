　　Our Army in Northern Henan Rapidly Expands Victory
    Liberation of Qi County, Capturing Over a Thousand Enemies
    Scaling the City Wall in Ten Minutes, Ending the Battle in Half an Hour
    [This dispatch from our newspaper, Northern Henan, dated 8th] (Arrived Late) The victorious counter-attacking People's Liberation Army of Northern Henan liberated the important town of Qi County on the central section of the Pinghan Railway at 6:00 PM on the 3rd. Our army scaled the city wall in just ten minutes and completely resolved the battle in half an hour. The five companies of the 2nd Regiment of the 5th Column of the pseudo-Sun Dianying's provisional Third Column, which had just taken over Qi County from Tangyin, and the entire Qi County "Homecoming Corps" were annihilated by our forces. Over a thousand enemies were captured, including the regimental chief of staff. We seized one flat trajectory gun, three mortars, fifty light and heavy machine guns, eight hundred and eight rifles and carbines, over 150,000 rounds of ammunition, and sixty head of livestock. Thus, the 130-mile section of the Pinghan Railway between Tangyin Yigou in the south and Xinxiang Chenbao in the north, except for Ji County, is entirely under our control, and we are now expanding our victories.
    [This dispatch from our newspaper, Southern Hebei, dated 9th] The county brigades of the Southern Hebei Tenth Military Subdistrict are actively requesting to go to the front lines. After completing their training, the county brigades convened a general meeting of all soldiers on March 18th. Under the call of the meritorious service campaign, Ningan Brigade's deputy squad leader of the first company, Niu Zhenji, enthusiastically proposed that, in order to serve the people and earn merit, he would guarantee that the entire squad would obey orders and go to the front lines. Subsequently, many squad leaders expressed their determination to go to the front lines. Dong Fuchen, the squad leader of the fourth squad of the Ren County backbone company, challenged Niu Zhenji, proposing to compete in combat and win battles on the front lines. After the squad leaders expressed their determination, platoon leader Zhao Zhenwei, deputy platoon leader Qiao Sheng, and many other platoon leaders jumped to the center of the meeting, expressing their determination to lead their entire platoons to the battlefield. Before the platoon leaders could return to their original positions, Zhang Yixing, the company commander of the Baixiang backbone second company, excitedly stepped forward and resolutely shouted: "I guarantee that all soldiers in the company will obey orders, follow commands, and go to the front lines together!" All the soldiers in the company stood at attention in response, shouting: "Obey the company commander's orders, obey the company commander's command!" Subsequently, one by one, the company-level cadres jumped forward to follow Zhang Company Commander's example. Finally, all the communists in the audience jumped around the leaders, shouting: "Communists take the lead! Endure hardship first, enjoy comfort later; guarantee meritorious service, complete the task!" At this time, the non-communist soldiers sitting in rows on all sides also shouted: "Learn from the communists, challenge and compete with the communists in work. We want to earn merit and also strive to become communists!"
