Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 22nd. The draft treaty proposed by the Soviet Union on the elimination of German militarism and the prevention of German aggression (continued, the previous part appeared on page three of yesterday's newspaper).

    Eradicate Nazism and Implement Land Reform

    Article 4: In order to destroy the roots of German aggression and transform Germany into a peaceful and democratic state, the Contracting Parties agree to:

    (A) Take all measures to eradicate German Nazism and the remnants of German aggressive "nationalism" disguised in other forms, and eliminate the possibility of the revival of the Nazi Party, Nazi groups, and institutions in any form. All influence of Nazis and militarists must be completely eliminated from Germany, and Nazis and militarists shall not engage in activities or propaganda in the future.

    (B) Provide the German people with all kinds of assistance to establish a democratic order on the basis of a democratic constitution approved by them; the German democratic constitution should guarantee the German people the freedoms of speech, publication, religion, belief, assembly, and association, the freedom of democratic parties, trade unions, and other anti-Nazi groups to operate throughout Germany, and appropriately guarantee the rights and interests of the working masses, while also giving some consideration to the needs of maintaining security.

    (C) Implement land reform throughout Germany, transferring the land of large landowners and Junker families to the hands of the peasants, as the former have often encouraged German aggression and financed dangerous German militarists.

    Occupation Cannot End Until Objectives Are Achieved

    Article 5: The Contracting Parties agree that when they believe that the following main objectives of the occupation of Germany have been effectively achieved, the Allied Powers shall consider terminating the occupation of Germany:

    (A) The complete elimination of German militarism in accordance with the instructions of the Allied Powers, including the removal of Germany's war industrial potential;

    (B) Rebuilding and consolidating the democratic system in Germany;

    (C) Germany fulfilling its determined reparations obligations and other obligations to the Allied countries.

    Article 6: After the termination of the occupation of Germany, a Control Committee shall be organized on the basis of the Four Powers. The Committee may, when it deems necessary, dispatch its officials or members to inspect, examine, or investigate any part or all of Germany. If Germany violates its obligations to the Allied Powers, the Contracting Parties may take coercive measures, including the use of naval, land, and air forces, if necessary, to ensure the immediate termination or prevention of such violations or attempted violations. The powers participating in the control shall regularly notify the Contracting Parties and the United Nations Security Council of the results of inspections, examinations, or investigations permitted under this Article, and the Contracting Parties shall also report to the Security Council on the measures they have used or are preparing to use. The Contracting Parties agree: (unclear code, the following paragraph is missing).

    Article 7: This Treaty shall be submitted to each Contracting Party for ratification in accordance with their respective legislative procedures; the instruments of ratification shall be deposited by each government and notified to each Contracting Party. This Treaty shall enter into force upon the deposit of the instruments of ratification. This Treaty shall be valid for a period of forty years, and the Contracting Parties shall consult each other six months before the expiration of the term: whether the interests of international peace and security require the extension of this Treaty—or its amendment, and whether the reconstruction of the German people's life on a democratic and peaceful basis has been successful and no longer requires the continued maintenance of Allied control.

    【新华社陕北二十二日电】苏联所提出的清除德国军国主义与防止德国侵略条约草案（续完，上文见昨日本报第三版）
    第四条：为摧毁德国侵略之根柱，及变德国为和平与民主国家，缔约国同意：
    （甲）采取各种手段根绝德国纳粹主义及在其它形式掩盖下的德国侵略的“民族主义”之残余，清除纳粹党、纳粹团体及机构在任何形式下复活之可能性。纳粹及军国主义者之一切影响必须从德国完全清除，今后纳粹及军国主义者不得进行活动或宣传。
    （乙）给予德国人民以各种帮助，俾在其所批准之民主宪法的基础上建立民主秩序；德国民主宪法应保证德国人民享有言论、出版、宗教、信仰及集会结社之自由，民主政党、职工会、及其它反纳粹团体在全德范围内有活动之自由，并适当保证劳苦大众之权利与利益，对维持安全之需要亦稍予照顾。
    （丙）在全德实行土地改革，将大地主及容克家族之土地转移到农民手中，因前者曾经常鼓励德国侵略并资助德国危险的军国主义者。
    目的未确达时占领不能终止
    第五条：缔约国同意当他们认为下列占领德国之主要目的确已达成时，各同盟强国即考虑终止对德国的占领。
    （甲）按照各同盟强国的训令完全肃清德国军国主义，其中包括对德国战争工业潜力之清除；
    （乙）重建并巩固德国的民主制度；
    （丙）德国履行确定的赔偿义务及对盟国所负之其它义务。
    第六条：终止占领德国后，在四强基础上，组织管制委员会。该委员会认为必要时，得派遣其官员或委员，赴德国境内任何一部或全部，视察检查或调查。德国如违反其同盟强国之义务时，如属必要，缔约国得采取包括使用海陆空军武力在内的强迫手段，以保证立即结束或阻止此种违反义务之行为或企图。参加管制之强国，应将本条款所允许之视察检查或调查的结果，经常通知缔约国及联合国安全理事会，缔约国且应将其已经使用或准备使用之手段，报告安全理事会。缔约国同意：（电码不明，下缺一段）。
    第七条：本条约应提请各缔约国根据各自的立法手续，予以批准；批准书由各政府归档保存，并通知各缔约国。批准书归档后，本条约即开始生效。本条约有效期限为四十年，期满前六个月内缔约国应互相磋商：国际和平与安全的利益是否需要延长本约——或加以修正，德国人民在民主和平基础上生活的重建是否已经成功，不再需要盟国管制的继续保持。
