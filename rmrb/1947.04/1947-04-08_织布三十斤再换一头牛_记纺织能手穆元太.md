Left-power old folks sing the production ditty: "Women spin and men plow, with food to eat and clothes to wear." But at this year's March 8th Textile Experience Symposium, I met a white-haired old man in his sixties, the textile expert of the Sixth District – Mu Yuantai.

This old man is sixty-six years old this year, a tall man with a ruddy complexion. His beard is white and long, and he always smiles when he talks to people, making people feel particularly kind.

With a kind smile, he told me, "My old home is in Ci County. Because of the famine years, my parents sold me to the Camel Temple in Zuoquan to be a monk." He sighed and said, "In a superstitious society, I closed my eyes and blindly recited 'Amitabha' for more than fifty years, once 'small birds followed bats to fly,' wandering to Wutai and other temples to knock my head white." But when talking about becoming a textile expert in the new society today, he showed infinite joy. He talked about his learning to weave, saying, "My home (Camel Temple) was originally built of stone tiles. There were six of us, all of whom participated in the mutual aid group. In the autumn of the year before last, the village elected me as a model parent. At the county hero meeting, I received a 'golden sign' with the words 'Model Parent' written on it. At the same time, I heard Political Commissar Zhai say at the meeting that this year the county's cloth production averaged only one small foot per person. How could this be enough to wear? When I returned home, I held a meeting with the children and discussed what Political Commissar Zhai said. Everyone suggested that we learn to spin and weave ourselves. So, we first weighed seven jin of cotton, and whoever had time would spin it. We quickly learned it, and the seven jin of cotton were spun into yarn, which was sold and then cotton was weighed again. We turned it over six or seven times, and when we had more yarn, we built a loom. First, we asked someone to install one, and I watched closely. After watching it a few times, I was able to weave slowly. Now I have become a good expert, and I know how to size the yarn, wind the yarn, and set up the loom. Last year, in addition to wearing it myself, I had twenty jin of cloth left over, which I exchanged for an ox. This spring, I have installed another eighteen jin, which I won't be able to wear out in the spring and winter rainy season. Under my influence, cadres and women in the two villages of Camel and Qin Family Village often come to see me weave. I also often go to the two villages to help organize weaving. Now both villages have been organized. Camel Village has eleven groups, five looms, and one hundred spinning wheels. I often go to the two villages to help install looms and study technology. This time I was awarded another spinning wheel at the meeting. This year I will spin more and more, and I want to spin another thirty jin of cloth to buy another ox." At this point, the women all looked at Old Mu, asking her to talk about her weaving experience. I saw that there were too many people, so I bid farewell to him. (Yang Yaochun)

　　“织布三十斤再换一头牛”
  　记纺织能手穆元太
    左权老百姓唱生产小调：“女纺花男耕田，有吃又有穿”。可是今年三八节纺织经验座谈会上，我遇到了一位六十有余的白发苍苍老汉，全六区纺织能手——穆元太。
    他老汉今年六十六岁了，是个红光满面的大高个儿，胡子又白又长，和人谈起话来总是笑嘻嘻的，使人感到格外的和善。
    他用和蔼的笑脸给我谈着：“我老家是磁县，因为遭了荒年，父母把我卖到左权骆驼寺上当了和尚。”他叹了一口气说：“迷信社会里我闭住眼瞎念了五十多岁‘阿弥陀佛’，曾‘小鸟跟上蝙蝠飞’，游逛到五台等寺叩白头。”但谈到今天成为新社会的纺织能手时，又表显出无限的愉快。他说起他学习纺织经过，他说：“我的家（骆驼寺上）本来是石头瓦片对搭起来的，我们共六个人，都参加了互助组，到前年秋天，村中选我为模范家长；在县群英会上得回一个‘金字牌’，上面写的是‘模范家长’，同时听翟政委在会上说，今年全县生产的布每人平均合到一小尺，这怎能够穿呢？我回到家里，给孩们开了个会，把翟政委的话讨论了一下，大家提议自己学习纺花、织布，于是先秤了七斤棉花，我们六个人谁有工夫就纺，很快就都学会了，七斤花纺成纱，卖了再秤花，来回翻了六七次，纱多了打个织布机，先请人按了一机，我在跟前钉着眼瞧，看了几次，我就能慢慢的织了，现在我已成了好把式，浆线络线按机等工作我都会。去年除自己穿还余下二十斤布，换了一只牛；今年春天又按了十八斤，春冬雨季穿还穿不完。在我的影响下，骆驼、秦家庄两村干部妇女们经常来看我织布，我也常到两村去帮助组织纺织。现在两个村都组织起来了，骆驼村共有十一个小组，五架机，一百个纺花车。我经常到两村帮助按机，研究技术，这次会上又奖给我一个纺花车，我今年更要多多的纺，要再纺卅斤布，再买一只牛。”谈到这里，妇女们都望着老穆，叫她谈纺织经验，我看人多了，也就和他告别了。（杨耀春）
