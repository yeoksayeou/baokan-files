Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, April 8th: Guerrilla warfare is becoming increasingly active in the suburbs of Yan'an, especially in the Nanniwan and Jinpenwan areas southeast of Yan'an. District and township cadres and labor heroes have led the masses to establish four guerrilla detachments, operating in Linzhen Town, fighting the enemy eight times, and capturing fourteen enemy soldiers alive. The guerrilla team led by militia company commander Liu fought two battles against the grain-grabbing enemy in the Matunchuan area on March 18th alone, capturing seven alive. On the same day, four enemies from Jinpenwan robbed the masses of eight pigs in Liuyitun. The guerrilla team intercepted them halfway, seized the pigs, and returned them to the masses. Under the protection of the guerrilla team, the local people's self-defense morale has been greatly enhanced. In Ganquan, south of Yan'an, ×××× guerrillas have now been organized. On March 19th, ten guerrillas from the Fourth District of the county fought the enemy, killing or wounding seven and capturing three secret agents alive. The Yan'an City guerrilla team has also developed and is extremely active in Qingliang Mountain, where the Xinhua News Agency and the Liberation Daily were located, and Yangjialing, where the General Office of the CPC Central Committee was located.
    
Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, April 8th: Comrade Gao Yanxi, a guerrilla fighter from the Hezhuang District of Yan'an County, captured seven Hu army soldiers by himself near Houjiagou in the district on March 26th, seizing more than 200 rounds of American-made bullets, 13 hand grenades, one military copper pot, and one military hoe. In addition to awarding Comrade Gao Yanxi three dan of millet, the county party committee and county government jointly issued a commendation order, conferring the title of "Combat Hero" and calling on all county militiamen to learn from him. On March 24th, the Hu army's 53rd and 61st brigades and others invaded Anse from Yan'an, and on the 25th, they fled in panic. Comrade Gao Yanxi, armed with a single rapid-firing rifle, conducted guerrilla warfare on the hills near Houjiagou, firing at the retreating enemy troops. When the enemy fired machine guns at him, he hid. At dawn on the 26th, he went to Houjiagou again. The masses told him that there were enemies in the village. He immediately went to the front mountain to fire a burst of shots, shouting slogans such as "Those who surrender will not be killed, and we won't search the prisoners' pockets!" Then he went to the back mountain to fire a few shots and shout again. The enemy was confused and fled from the village into a small gully in a panic. Gao immediately shouted: "First company advance, second company fire!" etc., and aimed at the enemy and fired, hitting the ground in front of one enemy's feet. The seven enemies were so frightened that they froze and dared not move. At this time, he was still aiming at the enemy, commanding three nearby people to collect their weapons. In this way, one by one the Hu army soldiers were called up to surrender their weapons. A total of seven soldiers were captured, including Wang Zhian from the 53rd Brigade and Yu Daishui from the 61st Brigade, and they were immediately sent to the county government. The items looted from Houjiagou were returned on the spot. Comrade Gao Yanxi is from Houjiagou. He joined the guerrilla team in 1935, and later joined the Red 29th Army, Police 5th Regiment, and other units. He retired in 1944 to help with local work. After this meritorious service, he was appointed as the captain of the Hezhuang District Guerrilla Team by the county.

    【新华社陕北八日电】延安近郊游击战日益活跃，以延安东南之南泥湾、金盆湾一带为最，该区区乡干部、劳动英雄已领导群众成立四个游击支队，活动于临真镇，与敌作战八次，活捉敌人十四名。民兵刘连长率领之游击队在麻屯川一带，于三月十八日一天中即与抢粮敌人作战两次，活捉七名。同日敌四名由金盆湾到刘宜屯抢去群众猪八口，该游击队即半路截击，将猪夺回送还群众。当地群众在游击队保护下，自卫情绪更加高涨。延安南之甘泉，现已组织起游击队员××××人，三月十九日该县四区游击队十人与敌作战，毙伤敌七名，活捉特务三名。延安市游击队亦有发展，在过去新华总社及解放日报社所在之清凉山及中共中央办公厅所在地杨家岭一带，均极活跃。
    【新华社陕北八日电】延安县河庄区游击队员高颜喜同志三月二十六日在该区侯家沟附近，一人设计俘虏胡军七名，缴美造子弹二百余发，手榴弹十三个，军用铜锅一口，军用铣一把。该县县委县府除奖给高颜喜同志小米三石外，并联合通令喜奖，赠给“战斗英雄”头衔，号召全县民兵向他学习。三月二十四日胡军五十三、六十一等旅由延安向安塞进犯，二十五日又仓皇溃退，高颜喜同志一人带着一枝水连珠步枪，在侯家沟附近各山头游击，向溃退的大队敌人射击。敌人向他打机枪时，他即隐避。廿六日拂晓他又到侯家沟，群众告诉他村里有敌人，他立即到前山打一阵枪，喊“缴枪不杀，不搜俘虏腰包”等口号；接着又到后山上打几枪，喊一阵。弄得敌人莫明其妙，狼狈的从村里向一个小山沟逃窜。高马上喊：“第一连前进，第二连射击！”等等，并瞄准敌人射击，一枪打在一个敌人的脚前，吓得七个敌人立即呆住不敢动弹。这时他仍瞄着敌人，指挥附近三个群众去收缴武装。这样胡军一个一个被叫上来缴械，共俘五十三旅的士兵王志安，六十一旅士兵余代水等七人，当即送往县府，侯家沟被抢的东西当场退还。高颜喜同志即侯家沟人，一九三五年即参加游击队，后参加红二十九军、警五团等部，四四年始退伍帮助地方工作。此次立功后，被该县任为河庄区游击队队长。
