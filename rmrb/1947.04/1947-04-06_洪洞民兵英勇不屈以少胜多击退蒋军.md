　　【Taiyue Dispatch】The Hongdong Third District Militia twice repelled invading Chiang troops, killing or wounding more than ten enemies. On the 21st and 22nd of last month, the enemies in Hongdong, with six times our strength, invaded our Third District. When two companies approached Fengbao and other places, the alarm was sounded, and the militia of thirteen villages bravely reinforced them. The enemy was attacked from all sides and was repelled by the militia after three consecutive assaults. On the 22nd, the enemy concentrated a battalion of troops to invade Dongzhuang. The militia cooperated with the security team to intercept the enemy on three routes. A certain squad pinned down an enemy company in the Wangcun Temple. The enemy used mortars and heavy machine guns to launch four fierce attacks on our seven warriors, but all failed. After three hours of fierce fighting, more than ten enemies were killed or wounded. Cheng Wanghuai, a 16-year-old soldier, killed two enemies by himself. During the battle, the masses actively helped the militia and cheered loudly to boost their morale. From 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM, the enemy was unable to hold out and fled, and the masses suffered no losses.

　　洪洞民兵英勇不屈以少胜多击退蒋军
    【本报太岳三日电】洪洞三区民兵两次打退进犯蒋军，毙伤敌十余名。洪洞敌人于上月二十一、二两日，以六倍于我的兵力，向我三区侵犯。当两个连接近我冯堡等地时，警报传出，十三村民兵奋勇增援，敌四面挨打，连冲三次均被民兵击退。二十二日，敌集中一个营兵力向董庄进犯，民兵配合保安队三路截击敌人，某班一个班将敌一个连压至王村庙内，敌以迫击炮、重机枪向我七勇士四次猛击，都未得逞。激战三小时，毙伤敌十余人。我一十六岁的小战士程望怀一人即毙敌两名。对战中群众积极帮助民兵，大声呐喊助威。从上午十时战至下午六时，敌不支逃窜，群众毫无损失。
