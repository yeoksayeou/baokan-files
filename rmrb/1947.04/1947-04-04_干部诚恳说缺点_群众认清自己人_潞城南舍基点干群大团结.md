　　【Report from our Lucheng Bureau】In the Nanshe focal point of the Fifth District, 688 cadres, activists, and "backward" masses were gathered for training. During the training process, the knots between cadres and the masses were untied. The main methods used were as follows: First, when the leadership discovered that the masses had opinions about the cadres but were afraid to express them, fearing retaliation from the cadres, they immediately stood up for the masses and assured them that the cadres would not retaliate. In addition, better cadres were mobilized to proactively seek out the masses to conduct self-criticism, guiding the masses to boldly offer opinions. When the masses saw that the district chief had given assurances, they began to speak up. The masses' opinions increased, first directed towards cadres and junior cadres who participated in the general training later, and then towards key cadres such as village chiefs and political directors. The main issues were unfair distribution of the fruits of struggle, poor attitude, and bad work style. When the cadres saw the masses complaining and offering opinions, some panicked, feeling that "loyal and good people have no good ending," while others became passive. The leadership promptly persuaded the cadres and guided everyone to discuss: if we are sick, and seriously ill, is it better to let the doctor treat us, or to wait for death? This inspired everyone's determination to make self-criticisms to the masses. After the cadres were determined, cadres and masses held meetings together to conduct self-criticism. First, District Cadre Comrade Cui Kuanxin very humbly said to the masses: "I was poor as a child and worked as a hired laborer. When I became village chief two years ago after liberation, I felt powerful and looked down on everyone. When distributing the fruits of struggle, I took more houses, more land, and more clothes. I forgot about everyone. Sometimes I lost my temper and acted rudely. This was all my fault. I will return the extra fruits I took to everyone. If you have any opinions about me, please tell me." Then other village cadres went to their respective villages to conduct self-criticism to the masses. Some cried during the self-criticism. The cadres' humility and sincerity moved the masses, who felt that the cadres of the new society were fundamentally different from the rulers of the old society. The anger of the masses subsided and completely turned into a positive desire for the cadres to correct their mistakes. For example, Zhen Zijun of Dongtiangong said to the village deputy Zhen Cailong: "You hit me twice, and I didn't dare to say anything at the time. Now you bring it up and admit that you were wrong. You have awakened. I remember your contribution in leading everyone to turn over a new leaf. I hope you will continue to be a cadre." At this time, the cadres also felt that the masses were being kind and helping them to find a cure, and actively asked the masses for opinions. The emotions of cadres and the masses were blended together, and the atmosphere of great unity was unprecedentedly strong. The vast majority of cadres have been approved and supported by the masses.

　　干部诚恳说缺点
    群众认清自己人
    潞城南舍基点干群大团结
    【本报潞城讯】五区南舍基点，集训干部积极分子“落后”群众六百八十八人，在集训过程中解开了干群间的疙瘩，在作法上主要的经过了以下过程：首先是当领导上发现了群众对干部有意见不敢提，怕干部报复，即给大家撑腰作主，让大胆的有啥说啥，保证干部不报复。另外动员较好的干部主动的去找着群众作自我检讨，引导群众大胆提意见，群众看见区长作了保证，这才说开了。群众的意见越来越多，先给后参加普训的干部和小干部提，一直提到主要干部村长政治主任等。主要有斗争果实分的不公，态度不好，作风恶劣等问题。干部看见群众发牢骚提意见，有的恐慌，感觉“保国忠良无下场”，有的消极。领导上便及时说服干部引导大家讨论，我们有病而且病的很重，还是让医生看好呢，还是不看等着死呢？这样启发了大家向群众作检讨的决心。干部有决心后，群众干部便在一齐开会，进行检讨，首先区干部崔宽心同志，很虚心的向群众说：“从小家穷当雇工，前年解放我当了村长，觉得有权有势就看不起大家，分果实我多分房子、多分地、多拿衣服，我忘了大家；有时候好发脾气耍态度，这都是我的不对。将多得果实给大家退出来，大家对我有意见，给我提出来。”接着其他村干部都分头向自己村里群众进行检讨，有的在检讨时哭起来，干部这种虚心诚恳感动了群众，群众觉得新社会的干部和旧社会的统治者根本不一样，群众的怒气落下来了，完全变成积极要求干部改错的情绪。如东天宫甄子俊给该村村副甄才龙说：“你打过我两拍子，我当时没有敢吭，现在你提出来承认你的不对，你觉悟了，我念起你领导大家翻身有功，望你还当干部。”干部这时也越觉得群众是在与人为善，给自己开方治病，积极的要求群众提意见，干部群众情绪融成一片，大团结的空气空前浓厚。绝大多数的干部都得到群众的批准拥护。（廉达、何旺、振华、白拴、宽心）
