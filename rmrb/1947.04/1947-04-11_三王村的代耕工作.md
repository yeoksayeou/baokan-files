The Work of Substitute Farming in Sanwang Village
    Luo Geng

    Sanwang Village is a village in the Ninth District of Wu'an that has done relatively well in its work. The village has 205 households, 746 people, and 21.56 hectares of land. A total of 65 people have joined the army over the years, accounting for more than 9% of the village's population and more than 43% of the village's young and middle-aged population. The substitute farming for the land of military families, retired soldiers, and cadre families has been done relatively well. The main reasons for this are as follows:

    1. The masses have sufficient understanding of substitute farming. Everyone often says: Soldiers are on the front lines, shedding blood and sacrificing themselves for everyone, working hard with their lives. We are in the rear, doing substitute farming on a few acres of land, which is what we should do. There are many model substitute farmers who first plant the land for military families when planting, and first weed the land for military families when weeding. At the same time, the level of awareness of military families has increased. They believe that joining the army is for everyone and for themselves. The village treats us well and takes care of everything, even better than when our children or husbands are at home. Therefore, they automatically propose to participate in production to plant their own land, as long as the masses plow the land, it is not necessary to do all the substitute farming. Liu Baoxiang, a widowed military family member, leads and promotes everyone to automatically help military families plant land, especially during the busy farming season, when everyone participates in labor.

    2. The substitute farming method is democratically discussed, and executed in several steps. The first step is to elect appraisers by popular vote. A total of 12 appraisers are elected, including military family members, cadres, and members of the masses. After the election, the second step is to appraise which military families need to have all their land farmed by substitutes, and which only need a few acres farmed by substitutes. This is determined according to the amount of labor available in the military family. The total land of military families, families of martyrs, retired soldiers, and cadre families in the village is 6.84 hectares, with 40 laborers. It is determined that all the land of widowed military families, families of martyrs, cadre families, and disabled retired soldiers will be farmed by substitutes, and military families with labor will have their land farmed by substitutes according to the situation. A total of 3.1473 hectares of land is determined to be farmed by substitutes. The third step is to let military families discuss in groups the households that the appraisers have discussed that need substitute farming and those that do not. During the discussion, military family members such as village chief Li Wenxiang, public security officer Wang Lisan, Cao Nand, Wang Yongle, etc. all automatically proposed that they did not want the masses to do substitute farming for them. However, the masses saw that they were cadres and were busy with work all day long and could not take care of farming, so they also gave them a few acres of land for substitute farming according to the situation. The fourth step is to determine the distribution of substitute farming land according to output, labor, and livestock. This is based on the specific situation of each acre. The total output of the village is 1,400 points (i.e., 2 shi of output is counted as 1 point, each acre excluding 1 dou of fertilizer, each shi excluding 1 dou of farm tools, and each person excluding 1 shi of consumption). The village has a total of 68 livestock, totaling 70 points (i.e., 1 mule is 1.5 points, 1 donkey is 1 point). The village has a total of 129 laborers, totaling 129 points (i.e., 1 laborer is counted as 1 point). The total is 2,229 points, and the substitute farming land requires a total of 4,160 workdays (i.e., 15 workdays per acre of distant land, 10 workdays per acre of nearby land). For example, Zhang Zengxiang has 15 mu of land, with an output of 14 points, 1 laborer counts as 1 point, and 1 livestock counts as 1 point, totaling 16 points. One point is equivalent to more than 3 workdays, totaling 49.5 workdays. Substitute farming on 3.1 mu of distant land requires giving other households 3 workdays (calculated at 15 workdays per mu of distant land). The fifth step is to distribute the substitute farming land. In principle, the appraisers take care of both parties, that is: 1. Those with less labor substitute farm for military families with more labor. 2. Those who have more distant land substitute farm more nearby land; those who have more nearby land substitute farm more distant land. 3. Those who live on that street substitute farm the land of military families on that street. 4. The wishes of substitute farming households to substitute farm for a certain military family or the wishes of a certain military family to have someone substitute farm for them are taken care of as much as possible.

    Because military families help substitute farming households, and because substitute farming households and military families have become one family, the masses automatically propose to give military families 15 jin of sesame cakes per mu of land. Those who do not provide sesame cakes provide 15 loads of manure, and guarantee that the output of the same land of military families will not be less than their own output. After a year of execution last year, the output of most substitute farming households exceeded that of military families, and the barren land was turned into good land.

　　三王村的代耕工作
    洛庚
    三王村是武安九区工作较好的村，全村二百零五户，七百四十六人，二十一顷五十六亩地，历年参军的共达六十五人，占全村人口百分之九强，占全村青壮年百分之四十三强。代耕军属荣退军人及干属的土地做得比较好。其主要原因有如下几点：
    一、群众对代耕，有着足够的认识。大家常说：战士在前方，为大家流血牺牲，拚着命干，咱在后方，代耕几亩地，是应该的。有不少模范代耕者，种地时，先给军属种，锄苗时先给军属锄。同时，军属的觉悟程度提高，他们认为参军为大家，也为自己。村里又对咱好，啥也照顾，比自己孩子或丈夫在家还如意。因之，他自动提出可以参加生产种自己的地，只要群众犁地，不必全部代耕，孤寡军属刘保祥领导，推动大家，都自动帮助代耕户种地，特别是农忙时，全部参加劳动。
    二、代耕办法经民主讨论，执行中经过几个步骤。第一步民选评议员，共选评议员十二人，有军属、有干部、有群众。选好后第二步评议军属谁需要全部代耕、谁只代耕几亩。根据军属家里劳动力多少而定、全村军属、烈属、荣退军人、干属，共土地六顷八十四亩；有劳动力四十人。评定孤寡军属、烈属、干属、残废荣退军人，全部代耕，有劳力的军属按情况代耕，共评议出代耕三顷一十四亩七分三。第三步将评议员讨论需要代耕和不代耕的户让军属分组讨论；在讨论中，如军属村长李文相、公安员王立三、曹南得、王永乐等都自动提出不要群众代耕，但群众看他们是干部，整天忙工作，顾不上种地，也给他们酌量情况代耕几亩。第四步按产量人力畜力定分评议军属代耕地，根据每亩具体情况定工，全村共产量一千四百分（即二石产量算一分，每亩除一斗肥料，每石除一斗农具，每人除一石消耗。）全村共六十八头牲口，共七十分（即一个骡子一分半，一个驴一分），全村共劳动力实有一百二十九人，共一百二十九分（即一个劳动力算一分，）总共二千二百二十九分，代耕地共四千一百六十个工（即远地一亩十五个工，近地一亩十个工）。例如张增祥有地十五亩，产量十四分，劳动力一个算一分，畜力一个算一分，共十六分；一分顶三个多工，共合工四十九个半。代耕三亩一分远地还给其他户出三个工（每亩远地十五个工计）。第五步分代耕地，原则上由评议员双方照顾，即：一、群众劳动力少的代耕军属较有劳力的。二、代耕者远地较多的，代耕时多代耕近地；近地较多者，多代耕远地。三、代耕者住在那条街，就代耕那条街的军属地。四、代耕户愿意代耕某军属或某军属愿意谁代耕，尽可能照顾。
    由于军属帮助代耕户，也由于代耕户和军属打成一家，群众自动提出愿意给军属每亩地上十五斤麻饼，不上麻饼的则上十五驮粪，并保证军属同样的土地，产量不能少于自己的产量，经过去年一年的执行，大部代耕户军属产量都有超过，而且把荒了的土地变成好地了。
