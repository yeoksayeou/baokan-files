　　Welfare Nursery
    Achieves Significant Results Over the Year
    Nannies' Understanding Gradually Improves
    Working at Ease and Actively Producing
    [Our Newspaper] Since its establishment a year ago, the Welfare Nursery has laid a solid foundation through the help of all parties and the efforts of all staff. The uneasy phenomenon that existed among the childcare workers in the past has now turned into a vigorous and positive spirit. They actively participate with the male comrades in the construction of children's playgrounds, repairing houses, demolishing walls, demolishing kangs (heated brick beds), carrying soil and other labor. Model childcare worker Comrade Deng Jin was injured last year due to childbirth, and now she is still striving to participate while ill. Everyone often gets covered in black ash, like workers just out of the coal mine, but their spirits are very happy. They enthusiastically respond to the Central Bureau's call for production and conservation, and carry out production by changing work methods without hindering the care of children. The types of production include textile, sewing, knitting sweaters, agriculture, etc. There are already fifteen spinning wheels. They undertake children's clothing at half price, and have already made sixty pieces of single clothing and trousers, and washed fifty-five sets of old cotton clothes, earning more than 35,000 yuan in wages. The method of division of labor and cooperation is adopted for making shoes. Many people work at the same time like a small factory, including pre-cutting the silk, padding the bottom cloth, twisting the rope, sewing the soles, and making the uppers. One hundred and five pairs of shoes were completed in thirteen days. Male comrades mainly focus on agriculture and have established a small welding iron shop that has already earned more than 4,000 yuan. In terms of conservation, the childcare workers voluntarily gave up all of their evening meal expenses and most of their shoes and socks, saving a total of 36,000 catties of millet. In addition to work and production, all staff actively participate in learning. Since August last year, the childcare workers have gone from being mostly illiterate or able to read but not write, to half of them being able to write letters, and many have learned four to five hundred characters. They place a wooden board with words written on it in front of the spinning wheel, and learn to read while spinning. Their political standards are also gradually improving, and they regularly read newspapers collectively. At this year's "March 8th" Commemoration Meeting, many childcare workers recalled the pain they suffered in the old society and felt happy to participate in the work of the nursery. The staff of the administrative office has a high level of work enthusiasm and has played a significant role in continuously improving the life of the entire facility. The health bureau's medical team provides enthusiastic service, ensuring the health of the children. An infant class has recently been established, specifically for the children of childcare workers and staff, resolving the contradiction between childbirth and work for them. (Gu Luo, Luo Yan)

　　福利托儿所
    年来获显著成绩
    保姆认识逐渐提高
    安心工作积极生产
    【本报讯】福利托儿所创立一年以来，经各方人士的帮助及全所人员的努力，已奠定了巩固基础。保育员中过去存在的不安心现象，现已变为蓬勃积极的朝气。她们踊跃和男同志在一起参加修建儿童操场、修理房屋，拆墙、拆炕、抬土等劳动。模范保育员邓金同志去年因生产身体受过伤，现在还带病争着来参加。大家常常弄得满脸满身黑灰，像刚出煤窑的工人一样，但精神却很愉快。她们热烈响应中央局生产节约的号召，在不妨害照顾儿童的条件下，变工进行生产。生产种类有纺织、缝纫、打毛衣，农业等。纺车已有十五辆。她们以半价承做儿童服装、已做好单衣、裤子各六十件，拆洗旧棉衣五十五套，得工资三万五千余元。做鞋采分工合作办法，前格帛、垫底布、搓绳、＠底、做帮，许多人同时活动像小工厂一样，十三天内完成一百零五双鞋子。男同志以农业为主，并成立一个小型焊洋铁铺已赚洋四千余元。节约方面，保育员夜餐费全部，鞋袜大部自动不要，共节约小米三万六千斤。全体人员在工作生产之余，还积极参加学习。保育员从去年八月至今，从大部不识字或会念不会写，已有半数能写信，许多人识了四五百字。她们在纺车前置一木板，上面写着字，一边纺花，一边识字，政治水准也逐渐在提高，经常集体读报。今年“三八”纪念会上，不少保育员回忆在旧社会中所受痛苦，对参加托儿所工作，感到快慰。事务处人员工作积极性很高，对于全所生活的不断改进起了很大作用。卫生局医疗队热心服务，使孩子们健康有了保证。最近已成立婴儿班，专收保育员及工作人员的孩子，解决了她们生孩子与工作的矛盾。（固萝、罗彦）
