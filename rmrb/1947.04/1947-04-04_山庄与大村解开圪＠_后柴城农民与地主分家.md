    Developing the Peasant Unity Movement; Clearly Delineating Class Lines to Overthrow Landlords

    Villages and Hamlets Resolve Grudges
    Hou Chicheng Peasants Separate from Landlords
    [Report from Zuoquan by our newspaper] Hou Chicheng is a very dispersed main village, including fourteen natural villages, many of which are mountain hamlets. In the past, the village governed the mountains, and historically, a long-term separation formed between the mountains and the villages. Last winter, during rent reduction and debt liquidation, when settling accounts with landlord Yan Xichang (a landlord in the village), the masses in the mountains were very energetic, while the villagers didn't even look. When the mountain masses took things out of the landlord's house, the villagers carried them back in for the landlord. The mountain masses had already dug up the landlord's silver dollars, but the villagers (even the cadres) still said, "There's nothing there. In the famine years, Yan Xichang even sold his children. How could he have silver dollars?" Seeing the lack of unity between the peasants in the mountains and the villages, the landlord pretended to be poor, determined not to take anything out to repay his debts. Poor old man Li Shengxi went to mobilize him, but was rendered speechless by Yan Xichang, and felt pity for him, returning to tell the representatives, "He said he doesn't have anything, and he cried so painfully. Let's give him two jars of fried noodles from the fruits of our struggle!" Most people believed him, and the liquidation ended hastily. Yan Yuxi even took the opportunity to sabotage, saying that there were many people in the mountains, and they would liquidate the villagers too. The masses looked at it from a village-centric perspective, and were quickly deceived. Under Yan Yuxi's instigation, they incited people to beat the chairman of the peasants' association to death; when they encountered the deputy village chief from the mountains, they dragged him down and beat him up. When the district cadres heard about it, they immediately went to expose Yan Yuxi's conspiracy, and the masses realized they had been fooled, but the separation between the mountain and the village had not been completely resolved. The mountain masses' antipathy towards the village deepened, feeling that the village "didn't have a single good ghost." But the villagers were like mutes eating bitter melon, unable to express their suffering, only afraid of causing trouble. After the in-depth movement, the leadership raised the question of inspection: Has feudalism been overthrown? Are the peasants united? On the former question, the mountains and the village had the same understanding, both saying, "When Yan Xichang was being struggled against and liquidated, he wore a torn cotton jacket, but as soon as it was over, he put on a big robe again, with a scarf around his waist. Can this be said to be thorough? Everyone hates Yan Xiao Si, but they don't complain about their suffering." When the latter question was raised, the villagers said, "As long as the mountains unite with us, we will definitely be able to unite." The mountains said, "The peasants of Chicheng and the landlords are one family. Unless they can separate from the landlords and be non-local, they will not unite." After three or four days of deliberation in the group meetings, the problem was solved. Li said, "We were fooled because we didn't draw a clear line. We didn't expect the landlords to be pitiable." Wang Yinhu said, "In the past, we looked at the people in the mountains as 'grass ash.' This time, there are many people in the mountains. We are middle peasants, so we are only afraid that they will liquidate us." Nai Shun from the mountains said, "At first, I thought that there wasn't a single good ghost in the village, but now that I think about it, that's not right. The disunity is because the landlord's special agents stirred things up!" On the 16th, at the combined meeting of the village and mountain masses, everyone clarified that the disunity was being exploited by the landlords. Therefore, only by improving ourselves and drawing a clear line; regardless of whether it is the village or the mountain, peasants are one family, everyone is of one heart, and fights against the landlords. At this point, the focus shifted to the struggle against the landlords. The villagers pointed out that the landlord had a lot of things that hadn't been taken out, and regardless of the mountains and villages, everyone was united, and the morale was unprecedentedly high, and the fruits of the liquidation were several times more than before.

    山庄与大村解开圪＠
    后柴城农民与地主分家
    【本报左权讯】后柴城是个极分散的主村，包括十四个自然村，有很多是山庄，过去一向是村统治山，历史上长期形成了山与村的隔阂。去冬查减，清算地主阎喜昌时（村里地主），山上群众很有劲，村里群众看都不看，山上群众从地主家往外取东西，村里群众给地主往回搬，山上群众已经挖出地主银洋，村里群众（连干部亦如此）还说：“没哪，灾荒年阎喜昌把孩子都卖了，那会有银洋？”地主看着山和村的农民不团结，便表面上哭穷，决心一点东西也不取出还债，赤贫老汉李生喜去动员，反而被阎喜昌说的无言答对，产生了怜悯心，回去告代表说：“人家说是没哪啦，哭的实在痛心，咱把果实里两缸炒面给他吃吧！”一般人也很相信，清算便草草结束。阎玉喜更乘机钻空破坏，说山上人多，人家要都把村里清算。群众用村本位的眼光去看，这很快就被迷惑了。在阎玉喜主使下，就鼓动起来要打死农会主席；碰见山上副村长，拖倒就打了一顿，区干部闻讯，当即前往，揭露了阎玉喜阴谋，群众才认识是上了当，但山村隔阂未完全解决。山上群众对村里的恶感更加深了，觉得村里“没一个好鬼”。而村里的人却哑叭吃黄莲，有苦难诉，光怕因此有了事。深入运动后领导上提出检查：封建打垮了没有？农民团结了没有？前一问题山上和村里是一个认识，都说：“阎喜昌在斗争清算时，穿着个破布袄，刚结束，人家便又穿起大袍，腰缠围巾，这能说彻底了吗？谁都恨阎小四，但苦却没诉。当提到后一个问题，村里群众说：“只要山上和咱团结，咱一定能团结。”山上说：“柴城农民和地主是一家，要团结除非他们能和地主分家，不本位。”经过小组会三四天酝酿，问题得到解决。李所说：“咱上当是怨没划清界限，没想到地主可怜不得。”王银虎说：“从前咱看山上人是‘草灰’，这次山上人多，咱是中农，就只怕人家清算到咱。”山上乃顺说：“我起初就认为村里没一个好鬼，现在一想也不对，不团结是因为地主特务给挑坏啦！”十六日，在村山群众合并会上，大家一说才明确了闹不团结是被地主利用了。因此只有提高自己，划清界限；不管村和山是农民就是一家人，大家一条心，和地主斗争。至此即转向对地主的斗争，村里农民提出地主没取出的东西很多，不分山村都是一股劲，情绪空前高涨，清算出果实较前多出几倍。（麻田通讯组）
