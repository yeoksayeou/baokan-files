　　Jiang Jun's Deputy Brigade Commander Gao Qiangbin
    Asserts Chiang Kai-shek is Bound to Fail
    [Our Newspaper] Gao Qiangbin, the Major General Deputy Brigade Commander and Director of the Political Department of the 127th Brigade of the 47th Division of Chiang's Army, was captured by our Jiluyu People's Liberation Army on March 15th during the Wangkan battle on the Yanjin-Jixian road. He was then sent to the Field Headquarters of the Jinjiluyu Military Region. Seeing that his left hand was injured, they immediately sent him to the hospital for recuperation by car. On the 27th, the reporter visited Mr. Gao, finding him relaxed and frank, without any worries, and expressing his gratitude for the preferential treatment of our army in every way.

    Mr. Gao is from Changle, Fujian, 50 years old, and a graduate of the 8th class of the Baoding Military Academy, having served in the army for many years. He himself stated that he had participated in many battles against the Communist Party and the Liberated Areas during the past ten years of civil war and this civil war; but after laying down his weapons this time, the Eighth Route Army did not hold old grudges, but still implemented a lenient policy, giving preferential treatment and doing everything possible to take care of him, which he will never forget. He pointed to the injury on his left hand and said to the reporter, "This injury was very swollen and painful at first. After arriving in your army, I was immediately given medicine. After several changes of medicine, it has improved a lot."

    When the reporter asked him what his impressions were after arriving in the Liberated Area, he first said, "Old Chiang talks about the Three People's Principles, but in reality, it is fascist dictatorship. In China today, if you don't talk about democracy, you are bound to fail. Old Chiang's implementation of a traitorous civil war dictatorship is also bound to fail." His attitude and tone fully demonstrated the true character of an old soldier. The words "Old Chiang" that came out of his mouth especially expressed contempt.

    When the reporter asked him what he thought of the Eighth Route Army, Mr. Gao unhesitatingly said in an affirmative tone, "The Eighth Route Army has brilliant tactics, great mobility, a strong attacking spirit, and good political training. In particular, your army's soldiers all understand why they are fighting, and they all have the determination to sacrifice for their beliefs. At the same time, your army's equipment is also gradually improving."

    Liu Guoxi (from Jinhua, Zhejiang, 33 years old), the lieutenant colonel storekeeper of the 95th Grain Depot of the Joint Logistics Headquarters of Chiang's army, who lived with Mr. Gao Qiangbin, followed Mr. Gao's remarks and added, "In my personal opinion, your army also has two advantages: the officers and soldiers have a very good spirit of enduring hardship, and orders can be carried out to the end, and the execution of orders is very resolute."

    Mr. Gao finally said, "Since I am here, I will be content. I would like to have ample time to study your doctrines and policies so that I can stand on the same front with you and work together for the independence, freedom, and peace of the Republic of China." (Chang Deng)

　　蒋军副旅长高强斌
    认定蒋介石必败
    【本报讯】蒋军四十七师一二七旅少将副旅长兼政治部主任高强斌氏，于三月十五日在延津汲县道上之王堪战斗中，被我冀鲁豫人民解放军生俘后，被送到晋冀鲁豫军区野战司令部。大家见他左手受伤，马上又用汽车把他送到医院休养。二十七日，记者往访高氏，见他闲逸坦然，毫无忧虑，处处表现出对我军优待之感激心情。
    高氏为福建长乐人，现年五十岁，保定军校八期毕业，在军队服务多年。他自己表示：在过去十年内战及这次内战中，他参加过进攻共产党和解放区的多次战役；但这次放下武器后，八路军不念旧恶，仍然一本宽大政策，实行优待，用尽一切办法多方照顾，这是他一世也忘不了的。他指着左手的伤对记者说：“这个伤，开始肿痛得很厉害，一到贵军后，马上就给我上了药。经过几次换药后，已好得多了。”
    当记者问他到解放区后有何观感时，他首称：“老蒋口头上是为的三民主义，实际上是为的法西斯独裁主义。今天在中国，若不讲民主，是一定要失败的。老蒋实行卖国内战独裁，也是一定要失败的。”他说话的态度和口吻完全表现出一个老军人的本色。从他口中吐出的“老蒋”二字特别表现出轻蔑的意思。
    记者问他对八路军有何意见时，高氏毫不犹豫地用肯定的语气说道：“八路军战术高明，机动性大，攻击精神旺盛，政治训练好。特别是贵军战士都懂得为什么要打仗，都有为自己的信念而牺牲的决心。同时贵军的装备也逐渐改良了。”
    与高强斌氏住在一起的蒋军联勤总部第九十五粮库中校库长刘国熙（浙江金华人，现年三十三岁），紧接着高氏的谈话，补充说：“据我个人看来，贵军另外还有两个长处，官兵上下吃苦耐劳精神很好，命令能够贯彻到底，执行命令很坚决。”
    高氏最后表示：“既来之，则安之。我愿有一个充裕的时间来研究你们的主义和政策，以便能和你们站在一条战线上，共同为中华民国的独立自由和平而奋斗。”（常登）
