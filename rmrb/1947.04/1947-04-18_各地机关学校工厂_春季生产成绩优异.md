Each machine in Group 2 now produces an average of 22 sets per day, exceeding the original plan by 49 percent. Comrade Zhou Jingzhong's machine produces 50 pieces per day, up from 30. Peng Yuemei, a family member, joined our army with her husband during the Shangdang Campaign. In this production increase competition, she also set a new record, sewing 50 buttonholes in one day. In March, she completed 800 pieces, exceeding the 660 pieces in February by 21 percent, earning the praise of the entire factory. Female worker Tian Qilian increased her monthly buttonhole production from 420 to 840 pieces. The total factory output exceeded last month by 50 percent. Section Chief Mi led the effort to make seat covers, personally getting involved, even when his hands were pricked. The entire factory is working hard to complete ×,000 ×,000 sets of single-layer military uniforms and created a new dyeing method – mixing good and bad pigments together when dyeing cloth, weighing the cloth in the pot, picking through each pot three times, and boiling for 30 minutes, overcoming the problem of inconsistent colors.
    [Reported by this newspaper] The Third Clothing Factory of the Military Supply Department responded to the call to save on clothing and food and voluntarily donated money.

Then Yan Yushan, Fan Shicong, and Liu Qingfu voluntarily donated money, contributing 5,000, 8,000, and 7,000 yuan respectively.

In this way, the workers donated 264,000 yuan in Jicha banknotes, one following ten, ten following a hundred.

Each group stayed up late into the night, voluntarily working overtime.

Individual production focused on spinning, with a total of 25 spinning wheels. In 20 days, 43 jin and 6 liang of cotton were spun, earning more than 17,000 yuan in foreign currency. Comrade Li Ming's spinning skills were the highest, able to spin 4 liang of cotton per day in addition to his work. Everyone's confidence is high.

In order not to bury the heroes, everyone discussed a method of recording work using work tickets. Two shangs and two fens are recorded in the early morning, two shangs and two fens in the late morning, and one shang and one fen in the afternoon, totaling five shangs and five fens per day. Correspondents sending letters or cadres with special tasks who cannot leave their work are recorded for half a fen. Private vegetable plots should be found in a guerrilla warfare manner, without harming the interests of the masses. The general affairs section has now bought cotton seeds.

    Elementary Schools in Pingshun, Neiqiu, and Other Places
    Production and Savings are Done Well
    [Reported by this newspaper from Pingshun] In the production and savings campaign, Pingshun No. 3 High School, in addition to cultivating the 40 mu of wasteland opened up in the winter of 1943, each student also planted small plots of land ranging from two to four fen, solving their own year-round vegetable and lamp oil problems. In terms of handicraft production, 14 female students formed a spinning group, and all 126 male students participated in the production of straw hat braids and knitted socks. The student union called on male students to also turn to spinning. Currently, Long Wenkuan and others have brought spinning wheels from home to start spinning. In order to solve the school's year-round coal burning problem, 51 teachers and students went to the kiln in Weizi Town on Sunday (the 30th of last month) to transport coal. They set off at 4:30 in the morning, each carrying a meal of dry food, and organized seven younger students to boil water in Qingzekou. They returned to school at about 6:00 in the afternoon, transporting a total of 2,261 jin and 6 liang of coal, saving an estimated 31,654 yuan in transportation costs. (Li Shan)

    Xingzhi School
    Launches a Spinning Craze
    [Reported by this newspaper] Xingzhi School has launched a spinning craze. In the beginning, most comrades could not spin. Under the organization of Comrade Li Shuwen and others, more than a dozen comrades have now learned to spin. Ding Yi, who is eleven years old, has also learned to spin. Jing Shuping, who is thirteen years old, said, "I can draw out the thread, and I will spin it evenly and finely in the future." Two groups have now been organized, with two people sharing one spinning wheel, seizing all available free time for spinning. Comrade Li Shuwen is also planning to weave the thread spun by everyone into cloth. Everyone is now actively striving to spin first-class thread. (Yin Dou)

In terms of production, a total of ten mu of wasteland have been opened up, each person handing in 50 jin of vegetables as a public task, and taking time to go to the mountains to dig for medicinal herbs. In terms of spinning production, there are now more than 70 spinning wheels (approximately four-fifths of the total number of people in the school), and they are preparing to buy a weaving machine and a cotton bow. They have now spun 30 jin of cotton. In terms of savings, special attention has been paid to saving lamp oil, avoiding working at night as much as possible, increasing daytime study time, and holding discussion meetings in the evening.
    [Another report] At the elementary school teacher conference in this county on March 20th, everyone was willing to lower their living standards, reduce the burden on the people, and save on clothing and food to support the front lines in response to the call from higher authorities for production and savings. Li Cunbao, a teacher from Songjiachuan, said, "I don't want to earn the people's rice. As long as the masses provide food, give me two liang of cotton per month, enough for my wife to spin." After discussion by all the teachers, each person will eat three dou of rice, one jin and four liang of salt, and half a jin of oil per month. First-class teachers will earn four dou of rice per month, second-class teachers three and a half dou, and third-class teachers three dou. Calculated with 358 people, 125 shi and 3 dou of rice can be saved each month, and a total of 1,503 shi and 6 dou of millet can be saved throughout the year. They also answered loudly that they want to fully develop the privately run fund and organize production as all the school's expenses, so as not to increase the burden on the masses again. (Li Su)
    Border Region Trade Bureau
    Streamlines Logistics and Intensifies Production
    [Reported by this newspaper] Since March, the lives of all comrades in the Border Region Trade Bureau and Trade Company have achieved significant results.

Over the past month, production has included opening up 4 mu and 4 fen of wasteland, planting 6 mu and 2 fen of gardens, planting 6 mu of dry land, spinning 13 jin of yarn, collecting 210 loads of manure, earning 5,700 yuan in foreign currency from transportation, earning 1,300 yuan in foreign currency from sewing pepper bags, earning 2,000 yuan in foreign currency from contracting to build pig pens, earning 4,000 yuan in profit from producing bean sprouts, and earning 13,000 yuan in profit from milling flour. The entire organization will save more than 226,000 yuan in subsidies for clothing and other expenses from February to the end of the year. The general warehouse has also canceled the water carrier and cook, with each comrade taking turns to carry water as production. At the same time, each warehouse is promoting doing things themselves without using logistics staff, saving six people throughout the year, which can save 720,000 yuan.
    Now everyone is very enthusiastic, especially Comrade Li Ruxiu's mutual aid group, which has become a model group for the entire organization. They have plans, can discuss problems democratically, and invite experienced farmers as teachers to learn from the masses when there are differences of opinion. The whole group is very united and has a high level of production enthusiasm. Comrade Dang Ying, a family member, cooks her own meals while taking care of three children, and has also spun three jin of cotton in a month. (Trade Bureau Communications Group)
