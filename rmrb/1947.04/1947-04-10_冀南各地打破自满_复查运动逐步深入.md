Jinnan Regions Overcome Complacency
Re-examination Movement Gradually Deepens
[Our newspaper Jinnan, 8th dispatch] Cadres in various parts of Jinnan have successively overcome complacency, and the re-examination movement has been deeply developed in various places. The reasons found in the re-examination for the incomplete eradication of feudal remnants are: (1) District and village cadres provide cover-ups. Zhang Dengyun, a landlord in Houchi Village, Niucheng, Qinghe, was protected because he was a relative of the village cadre and slipped through the net during the major struggle. (2) Unclear class divisions, without considering the size of historical crimes, nor the current wealth and living conditions. Wang Ligen of Nan Jia Village, Ji County, had fifty mu of land and a family of four, formerly employed long-term laborers, and dismissed them after increasing capital, becoming a short-term employer, and village cadres considered him a middle peasant. (3) Individual village cadres in the first district of Ji County did not understand the significance of returning land to the peasants, and did not pursue land and ill-gotten wealth after the struggle. (4) Leaving too much for landlords. Teng Ergao of Xiluokou, Ji County, made a fortune relying on the enemy, and was left fifteen mu of land for himself. During this major inspection, the masses saw through the landlord's conspiracy to evade struggle, and the cadres also changed their style and went deep into the grassroots. The Fifth District of Ji County has liquidated some landlords who were overlooked. The masses in Houchi Village, Niucheng, Qinghe, used the thinking meeting to mature their ideas and overthrow the landlord Zhang Dengyun. Zhao Rujing, the village chief of Louzipo Pi Village, First District, Guantao, had the puppet peasant association he organized abolished. He reorganized more than forty people and arrested Zhao Rujing and three local tyrants and landlords, beginning the struggle.

　　冀南各地打破自满
  　复查运动逐步深入
    【本报冀南八日电】冀南各地干部，先后克服自满思想，复查运动已在各地深入开展。复查中发现封建尾巴未割净的原因是：（一）区、村干部打掩护，清河牛城后地主张登云与村干部是亲戚受到包庇，在大动中漏了网。（二）阶层划分不明确，不看历史罪恶大小，也不看今天的财富及生活情形。冀县南贾村王立根，五十亩地，四口人，从前雇长工，增资后解雇，变为雇短工，村干部认为他是中农。（三）冀县一区个别村干部，对土地还家的意义没弄通，斗争后没追土地和浮财。（四）给地主留东西过多。冀县西罗口滕二高，依靠敌人发财，给他一人留下十五亩地。在此次大检查中，群众识破了地主逃避斗争的阴谋，干部也转变作风，深入下层。冀县五区，已清算了一些被遗漏的地主。清河牛成后村群众，利用想想会酝酿成熟，斗倒了地主张登云。馆陶一区娄子坡坯村村长赵汝镜组织的伪农会被取消，重新串连四十多群众，将赵汝镜及三个恶霸地主扣起，开始斗争。
