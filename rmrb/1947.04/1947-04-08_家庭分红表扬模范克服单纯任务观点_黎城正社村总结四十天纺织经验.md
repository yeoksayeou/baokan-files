Distributing Dividends to Households, Commending Exemplary Workers, Overcoming the Simple Task Viewpoint
Zheng She Village in Licheng Summarizes Forty Days of Textile Experience

[Reported from Licheng by this newspaper] In order to further promote the textile movement, Zheng She in the Fourth District launched a mass textile summary evaluation and inspection movement throughout the village. From individuals to groups, summaries were made. The reasons for completing the original forty-day textile plan were studied, as well as the reasons for not completing it. After inspection, the original number of textile women was 154, which increased by 9, the number of textile groups was 18, which increased by 12, more than 1,000 catties of cotton were spun, with an average of 5 catties and 12 taels per person; 537 catties of cloth were woven, with an average of 2 catties and 10 taels per person. It is calculated that each person in the village could wear a single layer of clothing; from the perspective of profit, the village earned a total of 1,436,400 yuan, which could buy 410 dan of rice, accounting for one-sixth of the annual agricultural income. In terms of tools, 5 small spinning wheels, 10 double-wheeled spinning wheels, and 3 hand-pulled looms were added. The village originally planned to produce 1,320 catties of cloth, and basically completed the plan. The specific experiences from the inspection: (1) Conducting ideological mobilization and textile-based prosperity education, organizing all 203 wives and young daughters into the textile movement. Each group set its own monthly plan, proposing the slogan "No idle time." Sixty-three-year-old novice Suo Wunu said: "I want to be a late bloomer." Originally planning to spin 4 catties of cotton per month, after the summary, she spun 23 catties of thread in forty days. Her main method was to get up early every day and spin two taels of cotton by mealtime. Ten-year-old Han Xuelan also spun 12 catties in a month. The model Zhang Sanping's group of nine people spun separately during the day, and collectively at night to save lamp oil, with two lamps for each person to spin three taels of cotton, also exceeding the plan. Wang Yuqing squeezed out time by eating two meals in one, originally planning to spin three catties in two months, but spun nine catties during the summary. (2) Grasping the reporting and inspection system and timely commendation improved the enthusiasm of women. Hero Yuan Qiuhua mobilized Feng Guinu to complete a plan of seven catties of cloth per month. Feng Guinu said: "It's tiring with children, and I have to cook and make shoes, so I can't complete it." During the half-month inspection and summary, she spun six taels of cotton. When she compared it with Yu Donglan's seven catties in the group, she felt very embarrassed. Later, Yuan Qiuhua persuaded her with accounting methods, and she spun four catties in the second half of the month. After democratic discussion to prevent laziness and false reporting, each group conducted a mutual inspection every night, using scales to weigh the cotton. The system of reporting every five days and inspecting every fifteen days was generally implemented. At the same time, it was announced that typical facts would be promptly announced to the whole village using fast clappers or loudspeakers. (3) Implementing the four-six dividend distribution in households improved the relationship between mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law and raised the status of women in the family. In the initial mobilization for dividend distribution, most mothers-in-law disagreed. Wang Yong'e's mother-in-law said: "That's too cheap, wearing a fur coat inside out, burning inside and out, I won't let him get his way." She would rather take four catties of cotton to Shangyao to exchange for one catty of cloth than give her daughter-in-law cotton to spin. The model Zhang Sanping used his own dividend example, spinning thread into nine catties of cloth in a month, the family divided forty-two chi, and he divided three hundred and twenty-eight chi, which cleared his mind. In forty days, Wang Yong'e produced fourteen catties of cloth, and her mother-in-law divided eight and a half catties. She now happily says: "Without textiles, a pile of cotton can only be exchanged for three and a half catties, this way is beneficial to everyone." Li Laping didn't receive dividends last year, and only spun ten catties of cotton in a year. She was often given the cold shoulder by her mother-in-law at home, and both sides had opinions. She also didn't have the energy to spin textiles, thinking it was better to make and sell shoes to earn money. This year, after the implementation of dividend distribution, she produced ten catties of cloth in forty days, her mother-in-law divided six catties, and he divided four catties. Both sides had cloth for the changing seasons, and her mother-in-law also changed her attitude, often smiling. After the four-six dividend distribution in the village, those with mothers-in-law adopted this method. Now the status of women in the family has been improved, and the family is also harmonious. Sometimes men even help them with spinning. (4) Improving technology and modifying tools. In order to increase the quantity of textiles, the model Zhang Sanping learned about the double-wheeled spinning wheel and personally went to the textile factory of the district cooperative for two days to learn. He spun eight taels the first day and twelve taels the second day, and now spins twenty taels. In the past, a small spinning wheel could only spin twelve taels at most. Yu Donglan switched to using a hand-pulled machine and weaves twelve chi every day. Her confidence is high, and she plans to weave twenty-five chi every day by the end of March. Guo Yuechen used to be lazy and used dry paste thread, and could only weave eight chi every day. Now she has discovered that by boiling the thread with boiling water, adding three taels of sesame oil and three taels of white bean flour, and three and a half taels of white flour per catty, the pasted thread is soft and shiny, strong and unbroken, and she can now weave eighteen chi every day. During this inspection, the shortcomings found were: First, starting from the task viewpoint, so a large number of weavers were not cultivated. Those who could weave only tried their best to weave, and those who could spin only tried their best to spin. Zhang Sanping, who could spin, did not weave, and Guo Yuechen, who could weave, only weaved. Neither of them learned all the skills, so the work exchange was also very simple, weaving one catty of good thread with eight taels, and bad thread with twelve taels. Second, rigidly arranging plans. So when mobilizing each person to complete seven catties of cloth a day, everyone felt a headache, and old hands were unwilling to be in the same group as new hands. For example, Wang Yingxiu organized four new hands, and the group did not complete the requirement of seven catties of cloth during the summary. They all reflected that they "suffered from the new hands." After inspection and summary, the village selected Wang Tun and 23 others as textile-based prosperity heroes and models, Zhang Sanping and three other groups as model groups, collectively exchanged experiences, praised the advantages, and pointed out the shortcomings. Each group then formulated the textile plan for the next month, and each group also put forward competitions to ensure that the summary contest next month will show who is better. Zhang Xian'e's group, three people were sick last month and did not complete the plan. After setting the plan this time, he said: "Everyone was sick last month and didn't catch up, this time we must work hard to make up for the merit." Now the whole village has even greater enthusiasm for textiles. The whole village strives to complete the plan this time. (Chong Qi, Fu Qi, Bu Dai)

　　家庭分红表扬模范克服单纯任务观点
  　黎城正社村总结四十天纺织经验
    【本报黎城讯】四区正社为了更进一步推进纺织运动，展开了全村群众性的纺织总结评选检查运动。由个人到小组，都做了总结。研究原定四十天纺织计划，完成的原因在那里，完不成的原因在那里。经过检查，纺妇原有一百五十四个，发展了九个，纺织组十八个发展了十二个，纺花一千余斤，每人平均纺五斤十二两；织布五百三十七斤，每人平均二斤十两。计算全村每人穿到了一件单衣；从得利计算，全村共赚洋一百四十三万六千四百元，能买米四百十石，占到了全年农业收入的六分之一。工具上增加小纺车五个，双轮大纺车十个，手拉梭机三架。全村原计划成布一千三百二十斤，基本上是完成了计划。检查的具体经验：（一）进行思想动员，和纺织发家教育，把老婆小闺女共二百零三个，全部组织到纺织运动中。各个小组都定出自己一月计划，提出口号“不留闲空”。六十三岁新手索五女说：“我要当个老来红”。原计划一月纺四斤花，经过总结，四十天纺线二十三斤，她主要是每天起早，到吃饭时就纺二两花。十岁的韩雪兰，一月也纺到十二斤。模范张三平组九个人，白天分散纺织，黑夜为节省灯油，就集体纺，二盏灯每人纺三两花，也超过了计划。王玉庆为挤出时间，每天折成两顿饭，原计划两月纺三斤，总结时纺了九斤。（二）抓紧汇报检查制度与及时表扬，提高了妇女的积极性。英雄原秋花动员冯闺女要每月完成七斤布的计划，冯闺女说：“有小孩累着，还要做饭、做鞋，可完不成。”在半个月检查总结时，她纺了六两花，拿着和组内玉东兰的七斤去比，觉得很不好意思，后来原秋花她用算账办法说通了她，后半月就纺了四斤。经过民主讨论，防止贪懒虚报，各小组每天晚上进行一次互相检查，用秤秤了。普遍执行了五天一报，十五天检查一次，同时宣称会及时的将典型事实，用编快板或用喇叭广播全村。（三）实行家庭四六分红，改善了婆媳关系，提高了妇女家庭地位。在初动员分红时，大都婆婆不同意，王永娥的婆婆说：“那倒便宜，反穿皮袄，里外发烧，就不给他趁心”。她宁肯拿上四斤棉花去上遥换一斤布，也不给媳妇棉花纺。模范张三平用自己的分红实例，一月纺线成布九斤，家庭分了四十二尺，自己分三百二十八尺，才打通了他的思想。四十天王永娥成布十四斤，他婆婆分了八斤半，她现在高兴的说：“不是纺织，一堆花只能换三斤半，这样做都有利。栗拉平去年没分红，一年才纺了十斤花，在家还是经常受她婆婆的白眼冷语，双方都有意见。她也没有劲纺织，想不如做卖鞋赚钱。今年实行了分红，四十天成布十斤，婆婆分了六斤、他分了四斤，双方有了换季的布，婆婆也改变了态度，经常是喜眉笑脸。全村经过四六分红，有婆婆的都采用了这个办法，现在妇女在家庭的地位是提高了，家庭也和睦了，有时男人还帮助他们打穗。（四）提高技术改良工具。为了提高纺织数量，模范张三平学习双轮大纺车，亲自跑到区联社纺织厂去学习了两天，头一天纺八两，第二天纺十二两，现在纺二十两。过去小纺车最多只能纺十二两。玉东兰改用了手拉机，每天织十二尺。她的信心很高，计划三月底要每天织到二十五尺。郭月辰过去贪懒，是用干浆线，每天只能织八尺，现摸索出用开水煮过线，每斤和麻油三两，白豆面三两，白面三两半，浆出的线发软发光，有劲不断，现在每天能织十八尺。这次检查中，发现不好的地方有：一、从任务观点出发，所以对织妇没有大量培养出来，能织的只尽力去织，能纺的只尽力去纺，能纺的张三平就没有织，郭月辰能织只管织，都没有学成全把式，所以变工也很简单，织一斤布好线八两，歹线十二两。二、死布置计划。所以在动员每人一日完成七斤布时，大家都感到头痛，发生旧手不愿和新手在一组。如王英秀组织了四个新手，总结时全组没完成七斤布要求，都反映说：“吃了新手亏”。经过检查总结，全村评选出王吞等廿三人为纺织发家英雄模范，张三平等三个组为模范组，集体交流经验，表扬了优点，指出了缺点，各小组随着订出下月的纺织计划，各小组又互相提出了竞赛，保证下月总结比武再见高低。张先娥组，上月病了三个人，都没完成计划，这次定出计划后，他说：“上月都病了没有赶上，这次一定努力补一补功劳”。现在全村纺织劲头更大。全村争取这次一定要完成计划。（崇歧、福奇、不代）
