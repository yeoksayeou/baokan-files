    [This newspaper's Taiyue dispatch on the 19th] The District Party Committee here convened a meeting of various organs and groups directly under the military region on the 9th to jointly determine the allocation of livestock to assist the masses with spring plowing and to set a deadline for compensating for the undervalue purchase of fruits. Regarding assistance with spring plowing, the following was decided: (1) Each livestock within the establishment and production units of various organs and groups should help the local masses cultivate three mu of land without compensation, and more if possible. In order to solve the special difficulties of livestock in the Seventh District, it was decided to allocate 30 livestock to form a spring plowing team, led by capable cadres, to go to that area to assist for one week. (2) The feed, vegetable money, and horse fodder for personnel and livestock participating in spring plowing will be self-provided, and no compensation will be sought from the masses. (3) Various organs and groups should notify their directly subordinate organs to immediately implement this decision. Regarding the handling of the problem of organs cultivating land and production units occupying residential housing: (1) Organs and groups occupying houses solely for the purpose of production and profit should pay rent at market prices, based on the principle of not causing losses to the masses, and strictly prevent uncompensated occupancy. If the masses need it, they should allow the masses to live there. (2) For the purpose of vegetable self-sufficiency, each organ can rent the necessary vegetable land, and the number of rented land is stipulated as one mu per 30 people, but it must be with the voluntary consent of the masses, the rent should be appropriate, and the land of military families, widows, orphans and households without labor should be rented. The phenomenon of organs mortgaging and buying land is absolutely prohibited. Regarding the issue of groups and cadres buying the fruits of the masses' struggle at low prices, it is stipulated: (1) If the fruits purchased at low prices are needed by the masses, the original items must be returned. If the original items are damaged, compensation should be paid according to the market price at the time. If the masses do not need them, the money can be paid according to the market price at the time. Regardless of whether the masses need it or not, all low-priced purchases should be compensated at the market price and an apology should be made to the masses to admit the mistake. (2) The handling of the above issues should be based on the principle of further strengthening the relationship between cadres and the masses, while not harming the emotions of the cadres. In order to ensure the thorough implementation of the above decisions, a five-member inspection committee was specially established by the participating organs. It was also decided to completely resolve all issues of borrowing land from the masses and buying fruits at low prices from the 10th to the 15th, and the various organs should conduct mutual inspections.
