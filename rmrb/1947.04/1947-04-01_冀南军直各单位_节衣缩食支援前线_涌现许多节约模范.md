(Jinnan News, 30th) The units directly under the Jinnan Military District have universally launched a thrift movement. The nine units of the Supply Department, with 266 people, saved 1,534 catties of rice, equivalent to over one million yuan in currency. Many models of thrift have emerged during the movement. Ma Jiuquan and Liu Zhimin, the chief and deputy chiefs of the No. 3 Bomb Factory, took the lead by saving 1,250 catties of rice. Among the workers, Gao Zuowan, Yang Xiuqin, Chen Zhian, Zhao Yihai, Li Youhai, Ma Xixiu, and 33 others saved over 100 catties of rice each. Livestock keeper Wang Youfu, in addition to saving his half-year subsidy of rice, contributed all his savings of 1,100 yuan to the public. Wang Keqin, the political instructor of the Supply Department, ensured that his family and children did not receive a single grain of rice from the public all year round; his family member, Niu Xiuzhi, also saved 40 catties of millet and handed it over to the public. The Matou branch of the cooperative, led by the Production Section of the Headquarters, decided not to eat wheat this year and to halve the food expenses. Comrade Lü Rongkuan, an elderly man in the Weixian × Store, saved all his retirement funds until Chiang Kai-shek is defeated. Comrade Zhang Zhuchao handed over all his pension money to support the front lines. The 30 reconnaissance members of the reconnaissance team proposed to cherish public vehicles, repair them themselves when damaged, and save seven single garments, 29 pairs of shoes, 59 towels, two pairs of socks, and 72 months of rice subsidies. Hao Zeyuan, the political instructor of the escort team of the reception center, often saved public food and firewood on business trips and handed them over to the public upon return. To promote the in-depth development of the movement, the Political Department of the Supply Department decided to formulate measures to reward models. The No. 3 Bomb Factory won the banner for the first time, and all personnel participating in the conservation have been recorded in the merit book.
