　　【Our Newspaper, Licheng News】In the Third District, under the active leadership and promotion of labor hero Li Chongqi, Autumn Tree Wall launched a wheat-hoeing campaign, hoeing 205.5 mu of wheat in one day. Autumn Tree Wall village cadres, heroes, and activists returned from a district meeting on the 15th of this month and immediately convened an expanded meeting of cadres, heroes, and activists. Everyone studied that in order to achieve "tilling three and saving one," intensive farming was essential. After the land reform, the masses' main demand was production. We must use all our strength to organize the masses and launch this year's great production campaign. At present, this means quickly hoeing the wheat, with cadres and heroes personally taking action. Activist Li Jinkao proposed launching a merit-making campaign, with a selection process after the wheat hoeing was completed, to be recorded in the merit book. Finally, everyone agreed on the criteria for making merit: (1) Cadres, heroes, and activists must personally take action to influence and promote the masses, playing a leading role. (2) Be selfless and able to help others. (3) Have new creations in technology. (4) Guarantee the completion of the plan. (5) Must work according to workload, universally using work tickets. (6) The combination of production and martial arts training must be regularized. It was stipulated that after each campaign ended, there would be a selection process, recorded in the merit book. A plan was also drawn up to complete the wheat hoeing and fertilizer transportation within five days, and everyone was very enthusiastic. When labor hero Li Chongqi organized wheat hoeing in his group, Jiang Xiangyan and Guo Zhihe had ideological objections, believing that it made no difference whether they hoeed or not. Li Chongqi explained to them, "Wheat that has been hoeed can absorb more water, the seedlings will be stronger, and it will produce more grain. In addition to making it easier to harvest the wheat, it will also be easier to catch seedlings when changing crops. This is the experience of Jiang Fucheng and Niu Xiangyun from last year when they hoeed the wheat, and hoeing the wheat is equivalent to plowing once when changing crops." After clarifying their thinking, the entire group universally launched the wheat-hoeing campaign. On the 18th, six people hoeed 11.1 mu of wheat in one day and brought ten loads of fertilizer to the fields, saving one unit of labor. Under the promotion of his group, the entire village universally launched the wheat-hoeing campaign. Seventy-five full laborers, twenty semi-laborers, and eight children participated. On the 20th, they hoeed 205.5 mu of wheat in one day and planned to complete the wheat hoeing and fertilizer transportation for the entire village before the 24th of this month. Wang Jucai, a labor hero from the attached village of Sancangou, convened a mass meeting of the entire gully, calling on everyone to hoe the wheat. Labor-martial arts hero Zhao Kaihui volunteered to lead the group to help military dependent Li Shengfu hoe the wheat without compensation, hoeing 2.5 mu of wheat early in the morning. The entire gully has a total of 55.5 mu of wheat fields, which were hoeed in one day. (Autumn Tree Wall Correspondent Group)
    【Our Newspaper, Cixian News】In Nanguan Dunhua Street, 38 male laborers and 4 female laborers, under the leadership of Deputy Village Chief Guan Ximeng, launched a surprise attack starting on the 13th of this month. Within three days, they hoeed 127 mu of wheat fields for 46 military families and 9.5 mu of wheat fields for 5 combat demolition teams, totaling 136.5 mu. The four women hoeed a total of 8 mu. Under the slogan of "Participating in the war without neglecting production," all the women who are able to work have been organized to weave at home or hoe the fields and water the crops, and the difficulty of labor shortage has begun to be solved.

　　秋树垣干部英雄带头下地
    一天锄麦二百余亩
    【本报黎城讯】三区秋树垣在劳动英雄李崇奇积极领导推动下开展锄麦运动，一天锄麦二百零五亩半。秋树垣村干部英雄积极分子于本月十五日从区开会回来，即召开扩大干部英雄积极分子会议；大家研究要想达到耕三余一，必须深耕细作，群众在土地改革后主要要求就是生产，我们必须用全力组织群众，开展今年的大生产运动，在目前就是赶快锄麦，干部英雄亲自动手。积极分子李进考提议开展立功运动，锄麦完成后来一次评选，上功劳簿。最后大家订出立功标准：（一）干部英雄与积极分子必须亲自动手，影响与推动群众，起带头作用。（二）不自私，能帮助别人。（三）技术上有新创造。（四）保证完成计划。（五）必须按活计工，普遍用工票。（六）生产与练武结合要经常化。规定每个运动结束后，要评选，上功劳簿。又订出计划，五天内完成锄麦与运肥，大家劲头很大。劳动英雄李崇奇在本组组织锄麦时，江详言、郭支河二人思想不通，认为锄不锄一样。李崇奇给他解释说：“锄过的麦，能多吸收水份，麦苗旺，又能多打粮，除了草不但割麦时好割，改茬时也好捉苗，去年江福成、牛祥云锄麦的经验就是这样，而且锄过的麦在改茬时足顶犁一次。”这样打通了思想，全组才普遍开展锄麦运动，于十八日一天六人就锄麦十一亩一分，并往地捎肥十担，能省工一个。在他组推动下，全村普遍开展锄麦运动，参加全劳力七十五个，半劳力二十个，儿童八个，于二十号一天内即锄麦二百零五亩半，计划本月二十四日前全村完成锄麦运肥。附村三仓沟劳动英雄王聚才，召开全沟群众会议，号召大家锄麦。劳武英雄赵开会自报奋勇，领导全组无代价帮助军属李生富锄麦，一清早锄麦二亩半。全沟共有麦地五十五亩半，一天即锄完。（秋树垣通讯小组）
    【本报磁县讯】南关敦化街，组织男劳力三十八名、妇女四名，于本月十三日起，在副村长关希孟领导突击下，三天内把四十六家军属麦地，一百廿七亩、参战破击队五家麦地九亩半，共一百三十六亩半已全部锄完；四名妇女计锄麦八亩。在参战不误生产的口号下，能劳动的妇女已全部组织起来了，在家纺织或到地锄田浇水，劳力缺乏的困难已开始解决。
