    Kangchuan Women's Weaving Group Prepares Small Hoes to Go to the Fields
    [This newspaper, Shahe news] Kangchuan Village in the Second District has a total of seventy-seven households with 873 mu of land. There are thirty-three military dependents' households. The entire village has forty-nine able-bodied male laborers and twenty-three semi-able-bodied laborers. In addition to cultivating their own land, they also cultivate 270 mu of land for others. This is all mountainous terrain, and the best laborers can only cultivate ten mu of land per year. This year, there is a great sense of labor shortage. Therefore, organizing female laborers to participate in agricultural production has become a very important issue. The village has fifty able-bodied female laborers and twenty-one semi-able-bodied female laborers. Their organizational method started with weaving. Zhang Rong's, the leader of the weaving group, initially organized ten women to engage in weaving. Within two months, they produced a total of 111 jin of cloth, with each jin of cloth exchanged for 28 jin of millet. They did not sell the millet they earned and have now saved 2,700 jin, ready to make up for the shortfall in agricultural income (here, relying solely on agriculture cannot achieve the goal of "耕三余一" [cultivating three, surplus one]). Influenced by her group, women throughout the village are saving millet. Currently, they have saved over 9,000 jin of millet from weaving. Based on this, Zhang Rong's mobilized the women in her group not only to earn money through weaving but also to set a model example of going to the fields to hoe seedlings during busy seasons. Everyone said they couldn't handle large hoes, so she had the blacksmith make smaller hoes that women could use. Her group made ten, which influenced two other groups to make more than a dozen as well. This is currently being further developed. They are prepared to transform from a weaving group to a hoeing group during the seedling hoeing season, which will solve a significant problem. (Kuilin, Zichao)

    康川妇女纺织小组打好小锄准备下地
    【本报沙河讯】二区康川村共七十七户，地八百七十三亩，军属三十三户，全村男全劳力四十九个，半劳力二十三个，除了种自己的地以外，还代耕了二百七十亩地。这里全是山地，最好的劳力一年只能种十亩地，今年就大感劳力缺乏，因此组织女劳力参加农业生产成了很重要的问题。全村女全劳力五十个，半劳力二十一个，她们组织的办法是先从纺织入手，纺织组长张荣的，先前本组十个妇女组织起来搞纺织，两个月内连纺带织共出布一百一十一斤，每斤布换小米二十八斤，她们换得的米都没有卖，到现在已存起二千七百斤，准备补足农业收入的缺额（这里光靠农业是不能达到耕三余一的）。由她组的影响，全村妇女都在存米，现共计纺织存米九千斤以上，从这一点上，张荣的就动员本组妇女不但纺织赚钱，而且准备忙时下地锄苗也要起模范作用，大家说拿不动大锄，她便让铁匠给打较小的锄，妇女用也能锄，她组打了十个，影响起两个组也打了十几个。现正在继续发展中，她们已准备好，到锄苗时期便由纺织组变成锄地组，这样就可解决很大问题。（奎林、子超）
