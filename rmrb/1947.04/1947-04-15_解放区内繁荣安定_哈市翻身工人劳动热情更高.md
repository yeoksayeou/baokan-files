Xinhua News Agency, Shandong: Industry and commerce are thriving in Dezhou City. The city's more than 20 iron industries have earned profits exceeding their original capital this year. The Xieshang Pot Shop has earned more than 800,000 North China currency (each yuan equals 15 Kuomintang yuan), and still has raw materials such as pig iron and coke worth more than 1.6 million North China currency. The soap factory on Weixin Street produces more than 1,000 finished products daily. The Jinfeng Bank, jointly funded by various industries, opened on April 1st and has established lending, remittance, and overdraft relationships with various industries. Under the advocacy and support of the democratic government, 24 silk and foreign cloth businesses have raised more than 1 million North China currency to form the Tongju Cotton Weaving Factory, and 9 of the 12 Guanghuo stores have switched to operating woolen yarn factories. Citizens are also investing the fruits of land reform into factories and workshops. Citizens in the Second District raised 800,000 North China currency to form a textile factory.

Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji: Botou City, located on the Southern Canal of Hebei and the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, is experiencing rapid industrial and commercial development. Twenty-eight foreign goods stores have switched to selling local goods. For example, Yushengdong Foreign Cloth Store has switched to selling Gaoyang cloth and is transporting its original stock of foreign cloth to Tianjin in exchange for bamboo raw materials. Taishengyong Guanghuo Store has switched to selling local goods and is actively preparing to set up a soap factory. Ten shoe stores, including Zhenda and Sanda, have switched to making native cloth shoes. Three iron factories are also actively preparing to resume operations, and Yonghua Match Company is currently expanding its factory buildings, preparing to install large machinery to supply the entire Hebei market. There are currently five soap factories and more than 30 bamboo goods businesses. More than ten newly organized cooperatives, mainly engaged in textiles, have also been established.

Xinhua News Agency, Shandong: Luo Suo, a fisheries expert from the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions, arrived in Yantai on the morning of the 30th of last month aboard the fishing vessel "Erierli" to inspect the fisheries situation in Shandong. The Shandong Yantai office of the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions held a welcome on the 1st at the Yantai Fisheries Construction Association, and invited several fisheries experts to discuss the issue of fisheries construction in Shandong. Gao, the chief of the Shandong Yantai office of the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions, introduced the general situation of Shandong's fisheries and its future development plans, stating: In 1936, the province had more than 13,000 fishing boats (excluding fishing trawlers), and Yantai's 197 fishing trawlers were the center of fisheries in North China. After eight years of destruction by the Japanese invaders, the province now has only 11,000 fishing boats and more than 30 fishing trawlers left, most of which have been in disrepair for many years. Fish production has sharply decreased, and canning factories have also been shut down. Therefore, the main focus of the fisheries construction plan is on recovery. The minimum current requirement is to repair 4,000 fishing boats and 25 fishing trawlers, as well as repair all canning factories and storage facilities. It is also necessary to recruit a large number of experienced sailors with 10 to 20 years of fishing experience to engage in the training of modern fishing.

Xinhua News Agency, Northeast: In Harbin, a special municipality, 25 streetcars now run daily on four streetcar lines, totaling 26 li in length, with a car passing every four to seven minutes on each line. At the end of April last year, when the Democratic Allied Army entered the city, only the first and third lines were open, with only five cars running daily. Since then, the number has increased monthly. Now, the streetcar workers in the city have been liberated and, with high enthusiasm for labor, converted streetcars with two electric motors to one electric motor during the severe cold of minus 37 degrees Celsius last winter, saving half the electricity. They also modified the Tokyo-style controller to be suitable for "Siemens," "Kongshi," and "Kawasaki" cars. They invented a new method of installing electric motors, increasing production efficiency fivefold, and used scrap iron to make 564 parts of 24 types. They saved more than 4.7 million yuan in material costs in repairing cars and installing electric motors.
