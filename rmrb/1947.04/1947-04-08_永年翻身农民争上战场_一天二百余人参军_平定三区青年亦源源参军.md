　　[Report from our newspaper] To defend their good lives after liberation, a surge of enthusiasm for joining the army has swept through Yongnian. On March 27th, at a county-wide meeting of district and village cadres and activists, over two hundred people signed up for the army on the spot. In the Fifth District, the village head, the director of the peasants' association, the militia captain, the tenant farmer representative, and the director of the trade union from Xiaobeiwang Village all went to join the army. One peasants' association team leader, who had two younger brothers, also sent them to join the army and planned to bring another one hundred and fifty people back with him. Xu Facheng, the director of the Xubeiwang Peasants' Association, is fifty years old this year and wanted to sign up for the army himself. Because of his age, he said, "I can't do it, let my son go!" Jin Rongniang from Zhanghuzhuang sent her son to join the army. Liu Gu, a model family member of a martyr, sent his only third son to the front lines. He said, "Elder and Second sons both died for the people. Now I am sending my Third son to join the Eighth Route Army. Defending our good lives is our own business. If our own people don't go to the front lines, who else can we count on!" Liu Ying, a disabled veteran from the Fourth District, re-embarked on the patriotic self-defense front. Long Caomeng sent her husband to the battlefield, Dong Zhenxingniang sent her son to the battlefield, and Sui Ning, the director of the peasants' association, also sent his only son, who was the only male heir in his family, to join the army. Tan Jingzhong led his two grandsons to sign up for the army. Village cadres from Qisanta, Liuxing, Zhoucun, Magu, Xisu, Shuangling, Shangcun, and other seven or eight villages all eagerly signed up. Zhang Lianfang, the district cadre and civil affairs assistant in the Third District, took the lead in voluntarily enlisting in the army. Zhao Zhuanglie already had two children who had gloriously sacrificed their lives, and this time he sent two nephews to join the army. Village cadres and activists in the Sixth District were not lagging behind either, with Deng Shang and Liu Jian sending their sons to join the army on the first day of the meeting alone. Now, the enthusiasm of the liberated peasants in various parts of the county to join the army is surging vigorously. (Xiao Shan, Yun Qian)

　　[Report from our newspaper] After the land redistribution campaign in the Third District of Pingding, the masses in over forty villages, large and small, have generally been liberated. The masses have further enhanced their ideological awareness and have clearly recognized that the reactionaries are the stumbling blocks to democracy, that Chiang Kai-shek is the root of national disaster and public suffering, that there will never be peace until the reactionaries are overthrown, and that the common people will never be able to live unless Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorial rule is destroyed. Therefore, during the land redistribution campaign, a surge of enthusiasm for joining the army has swept through the liberated peasant youth. Within three days, forty-five young people joined the army. (He Feng)

    【本报讯】平定第三区填补运动开展后，大小四十多个村庄的群众，大体都翻了身，群众在思想上的觉悟进了一步，明确的认识了反动派是民主的拌脚石，蒋介石是祸国殃民的害根，不打倒反动派永远没有和平，蒋介石的独裁统治不死灭，老百姓永不能活下去。因此在填补运动中，翻身农民青年掀起了参军热潮，三天内就有四十五个青年参军。（鹤枫）
