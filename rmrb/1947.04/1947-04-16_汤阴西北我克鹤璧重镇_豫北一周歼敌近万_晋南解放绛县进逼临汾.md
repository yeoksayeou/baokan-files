　　[Report from the Northern Henan Front, April 13th] The Field Headquarters of the Jinji-Luyu Military Region issued its third communiqué, announcing the results of the campaign to annihilate the Chiang Kai-shek-puppet troops in the Northern Henan area from April 3rd to 10th as follows:
    (1) Over 9,900 Chiang Kai-shek-puppet troops of Cheng Daosheng, Si Huasheng, Deng Jianqiu, and others were killed, wounded, or captured. This included the 2nd Regiment, 5th General Brigade of Sun Dianying's Provisional 3rd Column, and most of the 1st Regiment of the 6th Column of the Chiang Kai-shek-puppet army, totaling 2,300 men; the entire Hubei Quanlu unit of the 4th General Detachment of the Henan 3rd Administrative Office People's Self-Defense Force, over 1,000 men; the entire Tangyin Security Regiment and over 1,000 puppet troops under Si Huasheng; the entire Cheng Daosheng unit of the 1st General Detachment of the Henan 3rd Administrative Office, the Neihuang County Security Brigade, and the reactionary armed forces of the puppet county governments of Neihuang and Daming, totaling 5,000 men; and a regiment of the 49th Brigade's rapid reaction force and a part of the 66th Division of Wang Zhonglian, who were routed south of Yigou, over 600 men.
    (2) The city of Qixian and important strongholds such as Hebi, Pangcun, Caiyuan, Taibao, Chu Wang, and hundreds of large and small villages were captured.
    (3) The following were seized: 15 mortars, 5 small cannons, 356 light and heavy machine guns, 5,440 long and short guns, 2 arsenals, 4 cars, 500 shells, 350,000 bullets, 80 war horses, 8,000 dan of grain, 6 radio stations, 15,000 landmines and bombs, and countless other spoils of victory.
    [Report from the Northern Henan Front, April 12th] The People's Liberation Army of Northern Henan annihilated over 1,000 men of the 1st Regiment of the 6th General Brigade of the puppet Sun Dianying's forces, and recovered Hebi, an important stronghold west of Tangyin held by the Chiang Kai-shek-puppet troops. This enemy, intimidated by the might of our army's offensive in Northern Henan, abandoned the town on the 5th and fled towards Tangyin. They were ambushed by our army at Beitangzhong (between Hebi and Tangyin), and most of them were annihilated. A total of over 360 enemies were killed, over 700 were captured alive, and 2 cannons, 41 machine guns, over 500 rifles, over 50,000 rounds of ammunition, and a radio station were seized. Hebi was also recovered by us.
    [Report from Jilu-Yu, April 13th] (Delayed) On the morning of the 26th of last month, our 4th sub-district troops annihilated a town government office and three "Self-Defense Forces" in the Donggucheng area south of the city of Hua County, capturing over 200 enemies, seizing over 240 rifles, 14 horses, 14 large carts of grain, and a quantity of ammunition.
    [Urgent dispatch from the Taiyue Front, April 12th] (Delayed) The People's Liberation Army of Southern Shanxi has again reported good news, liberating the city of Jiang County and the important strongholds of Dayang, Beidi, and Subao. On the 9th, a unit of the People's Liberation Army advanced to the area of Fan and Dajiao south of Jiang County, gradually closing in on the city walls. The defending enemy abandoned the city and fled that night, making this the sixth county seat liberated by our army in a five-day offensive. The main force of the People's Liberation Army that liberated Fushan in the northern front continued to advance towards Linfen, receiving active support from the peasants along the way. Their power is at its peak, and the Chiang Kai-shek troops are collapsing at the mere sight of them. On the 10th, the People's Liberation Army successively recovered the three important strongholds of Dayang Town, Beidi Village (20 li east of Linfen), and Subao (25 li east of Hongdong). The local people were overjoyed and told our army about the suffering they had endured under the tyranny of the Chiang Kai-shek troops for the past six months, demanding revenge.
    [Report from the Northern Henan Front, April 12th] After launching the merit-making campaign, the "Shenyang" unit on the Northern Henan Front has made leaps and bounds in technology and created amazing records in combat. It only takes two minutes and forty seconds from the assault advance to breaking the deer寨, breaking the barbed wire, crossing the outer moat, erecting the cloud ladder, and scaling the city walls, and all subsequent troops can complete the city's ascent within fifteen minutes.
