　　Wuzhi Cadres Resolve to Persist in Guerrilla Warfare South of the Railway
　　[This report from Wuzhi] Grasping the powerful condition of popular support, all cadres in Wuzhi County gathered to discuss launching guerrilla warfare south of the Daqing Railway. Comrade Liang of the Wuzhi County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party first explained the favorable conditions for launching guerrilla warfare today. He said: In the past, when we went deep behind enemy lines, we looked down on the power of the masses. We did not combine with the masses, nor did we establish a deep bond of blood. Although the masses looked forward to our arrival, they were afraid to approach us too closely. For example, the masses said: "The Eighth Route Army has come down the mountain for five days and is about to leave." The masses were afraid that we would just "roam" and leave, and they dared not tell us many things. Because of the enemy's rape, plunder, and arson, even people in the landlord class were extremely opposed. For example, the landlord of ×× village voluntarily handed over public grain to us. A puppet army captain in ×× village also paid public grain, and the entire village has paid us more than twenty bolts of public cloth. Counter-revolutionary elements in various villages now want to return things to the masses. In addition, although our land reform last year was not completed, it laid some foundation. The enemy's destruction did not reduce the fighting spirit of the masses. They actively demanded to reclaim the land. After discussion among the cadres, they had confidence in maintaining the situation south of the railway. They clarified that in the future, they must believe in the power of the masses, launch a people's guerrilla war, and combine military activities with the interests of the masses. They also proposed to apologize to the masses, swear never to leave the south of the railway, to coexist and die with the masses, to be determined to protect the interests of the peasants' emancipation, to perform meritorious service for the people, and to prepare to welcome the great counter-offensive. (Liu Zhipeng)
　　[This report from Wuzhi] Since the Wuzhi Working Brigade and major detachments proposed a competition for killing the enemy and performing meritorious service in March, morale has been extremely high, and they completed a month's worth of plans for killing the enemy and performing meritorious service in four days. On March 5th, more than 200 enemies from En Village attacked our Fifth Detachment in several directions. When we discovered the enemy's converging attack, we immediately transferred. On the way, we killed or wounded three enemy regular soldiers. On March 6th, the Working Brigade went deep into Yongxingtun and Tun areas, luring and attacking the enemy from En Village, wounding one member of the puppet self-defense corps. That night, the team again went deep into Zhangjiantun, near the enemy puppet stronghold, under the leadership of the heroic Comrade Wang Fuchang, with brave actions, after fifteen minutes of battle, the entire puppet home-returning self-defense corps of the village was annihilated. Four were killed, ten captured, three long and short guns, and two livestock were seized. On March 7th, the enemy from the strongholds of Jiaozuo Ningguo, En Village, and Xiuwu Mulandiang converged to attack Xiaogao area. Our Working Brigade, under the support of the main force of the × unit, and led by the heroic Wang Fuchang, counterattacked, killing or wounding more than ten enemies. Our Comrade Song Yilong honorably sacrificed his life.

　　武陟干部下定决心
    坚持路南游击战争
    【本报武陟讯】抓紧人心向我的有力条件，武陟全县干部集会，讨论开展道清路南游击战争。首由该县中共县委梁同志说明今天开展游击战争的有利条件。他说：过去我们深入敌后还看不起群众力量，没和群众结合起来，建立下血肉关系，群众虽盼望我们却不敢多接近我们。如群众说：“八路军下山来五天了，又该走啦。”群众怕我们一“游”就走，有许多话不敢同我们讲。由于敌之奸淫烧杀，连地主阶层的人都异常反对。如××村地主自动向我交公粮。××村一个伪军队长，也交纳公粮，全村已交我公粮布二十余匹。各村倒算分子现都想给群众退东西。另外我们去年的土地改革虽没完成，但奠定了些基础，敌人的摧残并没减低了群众斗志，他们积极要求在斗回土地。经干部讨论后，对坚持路南局面有了信心，明确了今后必须相信群众力量，发动群众游击战争，军事活动必须和群众利益结合。并提出要给群众道歉，宣誓决不离开路南，要和群众共存亡，决心保卫农民翻身利益，给人民立功，准备迎接大反攻。（刘志鹏）
    【本报武陟讯】武陟武工大队，自和各大队提出三月份杀敌立功的竞赛后，情绪极高，四天内完成一个月的杀敌立功计划。计三月五号，恩村敌二百余，分数路合击我五大队，当发觉敌合击时，即行转移；途中毙伤敌正规军三名。三月六号，该武工队深入永兴屯和屯一带，诱击恩村之敌，伤伪自卫团一名。当晚该队复又星夜深入到敌伪据附近之张建屯，在杀敌英雄王福昌同志的领导下，以神勇的动作，经十五分钟战斗，即将该村伪还乡自卫团全部歼灭，计毙四名，俘十名，得长短枪三枝，牲口二头。三月七号焦作宁郭、恩村，修武木栾店等据点之敌，合击我小高一带，我武工队在主力×部支援下杀敌英雄王福昌亲率其队，反冲上去毙伤敌十余名，我宋一龙同志光荣牺牲。
