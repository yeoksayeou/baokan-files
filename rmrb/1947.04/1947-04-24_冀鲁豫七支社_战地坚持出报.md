    Hebei-Shandong-Henan Seventh Branch
    Persisting in Publishing Newspapers on the Battlefield
    [Our newspaper Hebei-Shandong-Henan 22nd dispatch] In order to strengthen wartime communication work, the seventh branch of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan sub-bureau has been independently active in the guerrilla areas of the seventh district. Under the cover of the broad masses, they went to villages near enemy-occupied areas to conduct interviews, writing and reporting news anytime and anywhere. On April 8th, the enemy's main force was moving back and forth on the ×× highway, but Comrade Deng Guangyun, a reporter, was still interviewing in a village three miles away from the highway, and the newspaper was often printed in a village one or two miles away from the enemy. They dispersed to various villages at night and concentrated on working in designated locations during the day. They have made reasonable divisions of labor in their work: some interview and print newspapers, some scout and guard, and some cook, carry water, deliver letters, and deliver newspapers. The enemy's situation is very clear, and the reports are timely. At present, the branch newspaper is strengthening contact with county stations and district groups, calling on them to strengthen wartime newspaper publishing and give full play to wartime tenacity. The Yunhe Daily, published three times a month with one page, has been published, and a mobile newspaper publishing method has been adopted. It publishes a few issues in this county and then a few issues in another county. This can reflect the situation and experience of each county and solve the difficulty of distribution.

    冀鲁豫七支社
    战地坚持出报
    【本报冀鲁豫二十二日电】冀鲁豫分社七支社为加强战时通讯工作，已单独在七分区游击区分散活动，他们在广大群众掩护下，分头到敌驻地附近村庄采访，随时随地写稿报导。四月八日敌主力在××公路上来往调动，但记者邓光耘同志仍在公路附近三里之某村采访，报纸也常在离敌一、二里之村庄付印。晚上分散到各庄去住，白天在指定地点集中办公。在工作上进行了合理的分工：有的采访印报，有的侦察警戒，有的做饭、担水、送信、送报。敌情了解望得很清楚，报导亦及时。目下支社报社对各县站、各区小组正加强联系，号召加强战时办报，发挥战时顽强性。现运河日报三日刊载一版已出版，并采取巡回办报方法，在这县出几期，再到另一县出几期，这样既可以反映各县情况与经验，又可解决发行的困难。
