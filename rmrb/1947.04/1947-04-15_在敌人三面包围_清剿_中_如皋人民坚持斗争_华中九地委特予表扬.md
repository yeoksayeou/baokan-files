Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 12th. The CCP Central China No. 9 Prefectural Committee recently commended the victory of the three-month anti-"suppression" struggle in the central area of Rugao County, praising it as a banner for persisting in struggle in the entire sub-region, and summarized its struggle experience as follows: The central area of Rugao includes the Jing'an, Dingdong, and ＠Feng districts, extending west to Rugao city, east to Dingyan and Chahe, and north to ＠Cha and Fengli, covering thirty *li* from north to south and more than fifty *li* from east to west, situated within the enemy's three-sided encirclement. Since January of this year, Chiang's troops have mobilized 2,000 to 5,000 soldiers, constantly launching brutal attacks, but the Rugao people have always stubbornly persisted, achieving victories in the anti-"suppression" struggles in January and February, and in the two large-scale anti-"encirclement and suppression" campaigns in March. The basic experiences of the struggle in this area are three: (1) The firm determination of the cadres to persist is the prerequisite for a victorious persistence. Most of the cadres in this area always persisted in their original locations, and the temporary retreat of a few cadres was quickly overcome, breaking the misconception that it was impossible to persist without relying on a small rear area. (2) The combination of tenacious armed struggle and the mass anti-Chiang self-defense movement is the magic weapon for victorious persistence. In the struggle, the former supported the latter, making the armed struggle increasingly active, while the mass anti-Chiang self-defense movement became increasingly widespread and elevated, proving that the arguments of "only weapons matter" and "the reactionary派社会基础雄厚 (reactionary派社会基础雄厚 - I couldn't translate this) has a solid social foundation" are wrong. (3) The mass line in leadership is the key to victorious persistence. The leadership in central Rugao grasped the irreconcilable contradiction between the broad masses and the reactionaries, unleashed the infinite potential power of the liberated masses, and launched a mass anti-Chiang meritorious service campaign as a central link in promoting the anti-Chiang self-defense movement, breaking the notion that the situation in the anti-"suppression" campaign was tense and there was no talk of "mass movement."

　　在敌人三面包围“清剿”中
    如皋人民坚持斗争
    华中九地委特予表扬
    【新华社华中十二日电】中共华中九地委顷表扬如皋县中部地区三个月反“清剿”斗争的胜利，誉为全分区坚持斗争的一面大旗，并总结其斗争经验如下：如中包括景安、丁东、＠丰三个区，西至如皋城，东至丁堰、岔河、北至＠茶、丰利，南北三十里东西五十余里，处在敌人三面包围中。今年一月起，蒋军动员二千至五千兵力，不断残酷进攻，但如皋人民始终顽强坚持，取得一二两月反“清剿”与三月两次大规模反“会剿”的胜利。该地斗争基本经验有三：（１）干部确切的坚持决心是胜利坚持的前提。该地大部干部始终坚持原地，少数干部一时退缩现象亦很快克服，打破了没有小后方做依靠不能坚持的错误认识。（２）顽强的武装斗争与群众性的反蒋自卫运动相结合是胜利坚持的法宝。如中在斗争中以后者为支援，使武装斗争日趋活跃，而群众反蒋自卫运动日趋普遍与提高，证明“唯武器论”和“反动派社会基础雄厚”的论调是不对的。（３）领导上的群众路线是胜利坚持的关键。如中领导上掌握广大群众与反动派不可调和的矛盾，发挥了翻身群众无限的潜在力量，掀起群众性反蒋立功运动，作为推动反蒋自卫运动的中心一环，打破了反“清剿”情况紧张、谈不到“群运”的想法。
