　　Zhong Wu Jing Village Cadres Delve Deeply into Groups, Accurately Calculate Accounts
    Break the "No Problem" Mentality
    Rest Less in the Fields
    Compete in Spring Plowing
    [Our Newspaper, Pingshun News] Zhong Wu Jing Village in the First District has 240 households, 836 people, 46 donkeys, 23 oxen, and 2,260 mu of land, averaging 2.7 mu per person. Living conditions are affluent, leading to a fear of hardship. The village has two notorious spots, one called "Stone Slab" and the other "Kiln Top," where more than ten people constantly watch passersby. On the 9th of this month, district cadres and more than 20 village cadres and villagers discussed spring plowing. The political director, the chairman of the farmers' association, and others said that if the village didn't participate in the war again, there wouldn't be a labor shortage and the land could be cultivated. They added that it was still early to start plowing. However, an investigation revealed a significant labor shortage in the village, and the cadres were not paying attention to leadership, causing the masses to drift, forming a complacent, lax "no problem" mentality. Therefore, on the morning of the 10th, a village-wide meeting was held for self-criticism. When the meeting started, the sun was already red, and only five elderly people had risen from the village; the rest of the men and women were still sleeping. Based on the above situation, the leadership gathered the village cadres to study the problem, and everyone was worried. The leadership then guided the cadres to first go deep into the groups and calculate accurately, using the calculation of living expenses to break the "no problem" mentality. The village cadres then divided the work and went to the groups for accurate calculation. For example, in Liu Guoji's group, there were seven households, four full laborers, one half laborer, two animals, 13 mu of wheat land, requiring 10 workdays; 15 mu of millet land, requiring 60 workdays; 14 mu of corn land, requiring 35 workdays; 13 mu of cotton land, requiring 12 workdays; 3 mu of potato planting, requiring 14 workdays; and various odd jobs, substitute plowing, preferential treatment, and resistance work, requiring 68 workdays. In total, 213 workdays are needed, but there are only 30 days until the Beginning of Summer, totaling only 78 workdays, resulting in a significant labor shortage. Based on the above situation, the cadres and masses were reminded, their thinking was straightened out, obstacles were cleared, and the mutual aid teams became active. From then on, the masses also automatically got up to rectify the mutual aid teams and discussed ways to make up for the labor shortage: (1) Leave early in the morning and rest less in the fields. (2) Do not leave a single idler on the team. (3) Carry manure and irrigate at night, solving the labor shortage problem. To further lead the sprint, the cadres made unified arrangements for living. From the 14th of this month to the first half of May, they will complete the construction of the dam, clean up the cotton fields, plant potatoes, hoe the wheat fields, and deliver fertilizer. They plan to spend the second half of next month living, conduct inspections in two phases, and promptly launch mutual competition. For example, Si Yi Gou challenged Zhong Wu Jing to complete spring plowing on time, judged by district cadres, and thoroughly inspected. Eight cadres were assigned to lead, and the village's mutual aid teams are actively and enthusiastically carrying out spring plowing.

　　中五井村干深入小组精确算账
    打破“不成问题”思想
    地里少歇
    竞赛春耕
    【本报平顺讯】一区中五井村有二百四十户，八百三十六口人，有驴四十六头，牛二十三头，有土地二千二百六十亩，每人平均二亩七分，生活上是富裕，形成怕吃苦，全村有两个出名的地点，一个是石板上，一个叫窑顶上，经常不断有十余人在上边看望路上来往行人。本月九日区干部和该村干部群众二十余人谈春耕，政治主任农会主席等都说村上要不再去参战，劳力还不困难，能种上地，现在离种地还早。经过检查，却发现该村劳力相当缺乏，而干部又不注意领导，使群众自流，形成了自满松懈“不成问题”的思想，即于十日早晨召开全村大会，进行检讨。开会时，太阳已经发红了，村中才起来五个老年人，其余男女都在睡觉。领导上根据以上情况召集村干部研究，大家都发了愁，领导上即引导干部要首先到小组深入计算，由算生活账，打破了不成问题思想。村干部即分工到小组精确计算，如刘过计组，七户四个全劳力，一个半劳力，牲口两犋，麦地十三亩，用工十个，谷十五亩，用工六十个，玉茭地十四亩，用工三十五个，花地十三亩，用工十二个，种山药蛋三亩，用工十四个，各样杂活代耕优抗用工六十八个，以上共用工二百一十三个，到立夏是三十天，总计只有工七十八个，劳力尚缺甚多。根据以上情况，提醒了干部群众，打通了思想，扫除了障碍，互助组即紧张起来，从此群众也自动起来整顿互助组，并讨论出补工办法：（一）天明早走，地里少歇。（二）队上不留一个闲人。（三）夜里担粪灌肥，解决了缺工问题。干部为更进一步领导突击，把生活统一做了按排，本月十四日到五月初半个月把堰垒完，收拾好花地，栽山药蛋，把麦地锄完，肥送完。到下月初计划后半月生活，分两期检查，及时开展互相竞赛。如寺邑沟向中五井挑战，按时完成春耕，由区干部评判，彻底检查，八个干部即分工领导，全村互助组正积极热烈的进行春耕。（双江、自考、路得、蛟龙）
