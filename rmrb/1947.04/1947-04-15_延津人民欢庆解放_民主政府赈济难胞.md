　　【Report from the front lines of Ji-Lu-Yu, April 12th】Yan Jin city, recovered by the People's Liberation Army on the 28th of last month, has rapidly restored order. The democratic government is actively providing disaster relief. Starving citizens are flocking to the government's grain distribution points to receive food. On the 30th alone, over 13,000 *jin* of relief grain were distributed. The people cheered and said, "Our own people have arrived!" The democratic government's offices and courtyards are packed with people, denouncing the suffering they endured under the KMT's tyrannical rule. The county magistrate is handling civil and criminal cases day and night. Jilu Yu currency enjoys a high reputation, and industrialists, merchants, and citizens are vying to use it, while KMT currency is regarded as worthless.

　　延津人民欢庆解放
    民主政府赈济难胞
    【本报冀鲁豫前线十二日电】上月二十八日为人民解放军收复之延津城，已迅速恢复秩序，民主政府刻正积极赈济。受饥饿的市民，前往政府放粮处领粮者络绎不绝，仅三十日一天中，发放赈粮即达一万三千多斤，人民均欢呼说：“自己人来了”。民主政府的各办公室及院里，均挤满了群众，控诉在蒋军暴政下所受的苦难。该县于县长不分昼夜的受理民刑案件。冀钞威信极高，工商业资本家市民均争着使用，蒋币则视若敝履。
