　　The people of Beicun Work Hard in Production
  　The Whole Village Helps Each Other with Sod-Turning and Manure Delivery
    [Report from Jincheng by this newspaper] During the emancipation movement in Beicun, the cadres continuously educated and explained to the masses the fear of getting rich. Now, all 172 households in the village have joined mutual aid teams, with no idlers or lazybones to be found. Even those who used to live by corruption, extortion, and exploitation have put down their airs and participated in labor, and their enthusiasm for production is quite high. They are not afraid of getting rich, as they understand that wealth earned through labor will not be subject to struggle. For example, the family of the landlord Feng Yuanting, who was struggled against, has six members and all of them are participating in labor. He and his two sons dig coal in the coal mine, his two daughters-in-law spin cotton for the cooperative, and his wife, in addition to cooking, does needlework for others every day. The whole family can earn 5.1 shi of millet per month. He is not only actively involved in labor himself but also urges others to work. Under his influence, all nine targets of struggle in the village have joined the labor force. Since the Lunar New Year, the village has organized 18 people with five ox carts to transport bean cakes down the mountain for sideline production. Twenty-five militiamen take turns transporting cotton from the west, and four mills have also established a coal mine. Another coal mine and a pottery kiln are under repair. To prepare for spring plowing, children were organized to burn grass ash, and 45 children formed four groups to deliver manure to 120 mu of land in a month. The village had no textile industry in the past, but within a month, 80 women learned to spin. Now that spring plowing has begun, the original mutual aid teams have been reorganized into twelve groups, and the widowed, orphaned, and childless are assigned to different groups. The whole village has decided to complete the work of delivering manure, building embankments, and turning sod before the end of February.

　　北村人人努力生产
  　全村互助垡地送粪
    【本报晋城讯】北村在翻身运动中，干部对群众怕发财思想就不断的进行了教育与解释，现全村一百七十二户，完全参加了互助组，没有一个二流子，也找不到一个懒汉。连过去靠贪污讹诈剥削过活的被斗对象，也都放下架子，参加劳动，并且生产情绪相当高，他们也不怕发财，他们了解了靠劳动发的财不会斗争的。如该村被斗地主冯元廷六口人，完全参加了劳动。他和两个儿子在煤窑上挖煤，两个儿媳给合作社纺花，老婆每天除了做饭外，还给别人做些针线活，全家每月可赚小米五石一斗。他不但自己劳动积极，并且还督促别人劳动，并在他的影响下，全村九家斗争对象，都参加了劳动。该村副业生产，自过阴历年，群众组织了十八个人、五辆牛车，往山下运豆饼。二十五个民兵，轮流到西边运花，四个磨坊，又搞了一座煤窑。另一座煤窑、一座碗窑，正修理中。为准备春耕，曾组织了儿童烧草灰，又四十五个儿童组成四个组，一个月往地里送粪一百二十亩。该村过去根本没有纺织，一月内有妇女八十名学会纺织。现已春耕开始，把原来的互助组整顿成十二个小组，鳏、寡、孤、独都分别到组里边，全村决定在前二月底把送粪、垒堰、垡地等工作完成。
