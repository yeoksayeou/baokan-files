    Retired and Demobilized Soldiers in the Second District of Shexian County Participate in Mutual Aid to Save Labor in Plowing
    [This dispatch from Shexian] The anti-requisition directors of various villages in the Second District, under the guarantee of doing a good job in preferential treatment for military families, have all taken the initiative to actively convene meetings to discuss the issue of substitute plowing. During the discussions, many model retired and demobilized soldiers and military dependents emerged. Zhang Yaozeng, a retired and demobilized soldier from Xuanzhong Village, initially said, "This year, we must defeat Chiang Kai-shek. We cannot be unfair to labor. We should try our best not to trouble the masses. If we want to enjoy happiness, we will wait until after the victory. I will not need substitute plowing this year." Following him, Han Genshu, Tian Lanting, Feng Jilin, and three other retired and demobilized soldiers also proposed not to use substitute plowing. Later, the military dependents also proposed not to use substitute plowing. The masses felt that they were women with labor, and they must substitute plow for some of them. The masses gratefully said, "Substitute plowing saves us labor, and we must use it to support the war. But if there are any difficulties, please bring them up, and we will try our best to help." Li Quanlin, a retired and demobilized soldier from Liujiazhuang, said, "The front lines are in need of people. We must look at the big picture and try our best not to use the masses for substitute plowing. It will be good if we save labor and defeat Chiang Kai-shek." Following him, Jia Yuming, Feng Lianzhen, Zhang Zhizhong, and Jin Maquan's wife, a military dependent, all firmly refused to use the masses for substitute plowing. Zhang Fuqian, a veteran from Taocheng, proposed, "We will do our best to supply the front lines and quickly eliminate Chiang Kai-shek. I turned over and got six mu of irrigated and dry land. I am forty-four years old this year, and I want to participate in the mutual aid group to save substitute plowing labor." Xu Dezhang, a veteran, said, "I am a first-class disabled person, and one of my arms is useless. I have five and a half mu of land, and the masses can substitute plow for two and a half mu for me." Under their influence, seven retired and demobilized soldiers, including Yang Zhaochun, Wang Qifu, and Zhang Lan, did not need substitute plowing and wanted to help with the village's work. Wu Deyuan, a military dependent, is sixty-four years old this year and declared that he would not use livestock or manpower. Wang E'er, a military dependent woman, said, "I will do everything I can in the fields and in life. I only need everyone to help me plow, and I can exchange labor with everyone. I can do the rest of the work like carrying water and collecting firewood." All the military dependents in the village made plans to save labor and livestock. Compared with the substitute plowed land last year, a total of 63 mu of substitute plowing was reduced, saving a total of 1,260 units of manpower and livestock for irrigated and dry land. Later, Comrade Liu Zhibin, the war service director, concluded, "Today, everyone has proposed to do their best and save the village's help to support the front lines. This method and idea is very good, but if you need help, you must tell us, and we will try our best to help." Now, the village cadres, military dependents, retired and demobilized soldiers, and the masses are united very well under the premise of everything for supporting the front lines. (Lu Qing)

    涉县二区荣退军人参加互助节省代耕
    【本报涉县讯】二区各村抗勤主任，在一定把优军工作做好的保证下，都主动的、积极的召开会议，商量代耕问题；在商量中出现了很多的模范荣退军人与军属：悬钟村荣退军人张耀曾开始说：“今年要打败蒋介石，咱能亏对劳动，尽量不用群众，要享福等胜利以后，我今年是不用代耕。”接着有韩根书、田兰亭、冯吉林等四个荣退军人都提出不代耕。后来军属也提出不代耕。群众觉得他们是些妇女劳力，一定要代耕一部分；群众感激的说：“代耕省下我们劳力，我们一定要用到支援战争上，但啥时有困难就提出来尽量帮助。”刘家庄荣退军人李全林说：“前方正是用人时，咱们要看大方面，尽量不用群众代耕，节省下工，打垮蒋介石就好了。”接着贾玉明、冯连珍、张之忠，军属靳马全嫂都坚决不用群众代耕。桃城荣誉军人张福谦提出：“咱们全力供给前线，很快消灭蒋介石。我翻身得到水旱地六亩，今年四十四岁了，我要参加互助组节省代耕工。”荣誉军人许德张说：“我是头等残废，有一个胳膊不管用，我有五亩五分地，群众给我代耕二亩半就行了。”在他二人影响下，有杨照春、王起富、张岚等七个荣退军人不用代耕，并要帮助村上工作。军属吴德元今年六十四岁了，声明畜力人力都不用。军属妇女王娥儿说：“田地生活我能做的一定做，只用大家帮助我耕种，我可以与大家变工，其余担水拾柴我都能干。”以下全村军属都做了节省劳力畜力的计划，与去年代耕地对比，共少代耕六十三亩，水旱地共省人力畜力一千二百六十个工。后由战勤主任刘质斌同志总结说：“今天大家提出自己尽量干，节省村上帮助，支援前线的办法和思想是很好的，但大家需要帮助时一定要讲出来，尽量帮助。”现在村干军属荣退军人群众在一切为了支援前线下团结得很好。（陆青）
