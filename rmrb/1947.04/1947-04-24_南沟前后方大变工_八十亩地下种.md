    South Gou Front and Rear Implement Major Labor Exchange
    Eighty Mu of Land Planted
    [This newspaper, Lin County News] To solve the production difficulties after participating in the war, Nan Gou Village in the Third District organized a major labor exchange between the front and the rear. After most of the young and middle-aged people in the village enthusiastically went to the front line, village chief Yang Shoucang formed the people who stayed at home into five mutual aid groups. They first finished planting the land for those who participated in the war and the military dependents, and then planted the land for those who stayed at home. Working in the fields at home counted as one work day, and participating in the war outside counted as half a work day. The method of recording separately and calculating as a whole was adopted – waiting until the end of the war to settle the accounts at once. Mutual aid team leader Yang Lao Han brought his own dry food and finished a day and a half's work for the militiamen's families in one day. He said, "They are fighting Lao Jiang for everyone, so we should do the same for them." In half a month, the village had completely delivered all the manure, plowed 208 mu of land, and planted 79.5 mu. Xu Sanyu, a family member of a war participant, led a women's mutual aid group and also plowed three mu and planted one mu. In addition, the primary school teachers also organized the children into six groups to do odd jobs for the families of those who participated in the war, and delivered water to the homes of those who participated in the war every other day to solve their drinking water difficulties.

    【本报林县讯】三区南沟村，组织前后方大变工，解决参战后的生产困难。该村自大部青壮年踊跃上前线后，村长杨守仓将留在家里的人组成五个互助组，先给参战的和军属种完了再种留在家里的地，在家种地一天算一个工，在外参战一天算个半工。采用零记整算的办法——待参战毕一次算帐。互助队长杨老汉自带干粮给民兵家一天赶完了天半的活，他说：“人家打老蒋为大家，咱也要为人家才对。”该村半月中粪已全部送完，翻地二百零八亩，种了七十九亩半。参战家属许三玉领导着一个妇女互助组，也翻了三亩种了一亩。另外小学教员将儿童也组织了六个组，给参战的家里做杂活，并隔一天给参战的家中送一次水解决他们家中的吃水困难。（杨锦波）
