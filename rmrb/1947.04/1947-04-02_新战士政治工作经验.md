Political Work Experience with New Soldiers
    Nan Fei
    After new soldiers join the army, consolidating the troops is a major part of political work. New soldiers are prone to desertion due to inadequate mobilization methods, low levels of awareness, insufficient understanding of the current situation, sudden changes in living habits, homesickness, fear of sacrifice, and the occasional disruption caused by saboteurs who seize the opportunity to infiltrate. How can we consolidate new soldiers?
    I. Three Basic Links in Consolidating Troops: Ideological Alignment, Problem Solving, and the mass line are the three basic links in consolidating new soldiers. The first step is to understand the basic points of ideological conflict among new soldiers and their changing process. Through enlightenment, patient persuasion, and education, promote their internal changes, untie ideological knots, and make them fully aware of the glory of joining the army. At the same time, coordinate with local cadres to solve the specific and reasonable problems raised by new soldiers, requiring district and village cadres to come directly to the troops to solve them. Sometimes, problems that cannot be solved by the troops' explanation ninety-nine times can be solved by district and village cadres in a few words. In addition, consolidating new soldiers cannot rely solely on a few political cadres. We must follow the mass line, trust the masses, rely on the masses, and fully mobilize the masses, entrusting the task of consolidating troops to the masses. As long as the enthusiasm of the masses is brought into play, more and better consolidation methods will be discovered. I asked a deputy squad leader how to consolidate new soldiers, and his reply was: "When a new soldier is in low spirits, talk to him, find out the problem, and solve it in time, without delay; if I can't solve it, let someone else talk to him; if that doesn't work, hold a meeting for everyone to talk." His words precisely illustrate the practical application of the three principles. However, ideological alignment, problem solving, and the power of the masses must be closely integrated and indispensable. Emphasizing only ideological alignment is empty talk; emphasizing only problem solving becomes bribery; emphasizing only the power of the masses becomes coercion.
    II. Mass Supervision: 1. Expose deserters. The masses should publicly expose suspicious elements with signs of desertion at military meetings. Those exposed often swear on the spot that they will compete with those who exposed them to not desert. 2. Formulate joint covenants. At military meetings, everyone speaks up, with the central theme being to swear not to desert, gathering the opinions of the entire company into a covenant, which is passed by the entire company and observed by everyone. 3. Establish mutual aid groups, with everyone freely finding two or three people to form a mutual aid group. In this way, backward elements will feel isolated and helpless, and will be forced to find platoon leaders or squad leaders to guarantee their participation in the mutual aid group. The main purpose of the mutual aid group is mutual aid in learning, with a mutual restraining effect. 4. Launch consolidation competitions based on squads. Propose conditions, challenge each other, and constantly elect, announce, and reward consolidation models. In addition, organizing discipline inspection teams at the battalion level, holding criticism and self-criticism meetings against desertion, and mobilizing the masses to find ways to overcome the unstable emotions of individual new soldiers can all consolidate the emotions of new soldiers.
    III. Promote the Fine Traditions of the Troops: In the beginning, appropriately strengthen military management for new soldiers, while strengthening political education. Eradicate beating and scolding, abolish purely punitive measures, cultivate a united style of respecting officers and cherishing soldiers, and make new soldiers experience the warmth of the revolutionary army. We have adopted and achieved practical results in management methods, such as using soldiers to consolidate soldiers, active elements to consolidate backward elements, mutual assistance and restraint, strengthening the work of army garrisons and surrounding villages, strictly enforcing the leave and return system of the troops, and stipulating family visit methods, all of which play a positive role in consolidating new soldiers.
    IV. Boldly Use Active Elements: There are two types of active elements among new soldiers, genuine and fake. The main thing is to see whether they can represent the demands of the masses and the actual results of their work.
    Some people with greater social habits, in order to cover up their escape, show flattery to superiors and appear active at certain times, but have a "cold-hot" sickness and their relationship with the masses is not very close, which is often fake. Genuine active elements have a close relationship with the masses, and the masses love them, and they are down-to-earth in their work. Leaders should always discover and promote new active elements to replace those who have become passive. For some active elements, it is also necessary to observe their performance in certain issues and their lack of enthusiasm in other issues, and stipulate specific and different usage methods. This means that we must carefully understand the reasons and characteristics of their enthusiasm. If used inappropriately, it may have the opposite effect. For backward elements, we must use active elements to lead the way forward, use the exemplary role of cadres to influence them, convene progress meetings for them, encourage progress, and, if necessary, elect them as mutual aid group leaders or deputy leaders, or promote them to deputy squad leaders in administration, which will also play a role in promoting progress. As active elements gradually increase and backward elements gradually decrease, intermediate elements will transform towards active elements, and the troops will be more consolidated.
    V. Give Play to the Role of Local Cadres and Mass Leaders: During the conscription mobilization, a portion of local cadres and mass leaders take the lead in joining the army. After arriving in the troops, they still maintain close ties with the new soldiers and the masses. Through their connection with the masses, uniting the masses, and consolidating the troops, they will play a good role. The troops must trust them, care for them, and boldly entrust them with responsibilities. They cannot look down on them because they do not understand military affairs and are not familiar with army life. The troops must effectively grasp this group of local cadres and mass leaders, telling them that they must not only take the lead in joining the army, but also take the lead in training and going to the front to fight, otherwise they will lose their cadre status and leader status. Clear their minds and make them work with peace of mind.
    VI. Do a Good Job in Family Reception Work: Family issues are a major problem in consolidating new soldiers. After new soldiers arrive in the army, many new soldiers' families come to visit in the initial period. When family members come, they generally ask the new soldiers for leave to go home, or raise a lot of difficult problems that cannot be solved, which makes the new soldiers feel uneasy. Therefore, we must strictly stipulate the family reception system, and family members are not allowed to be received in the squad or company. The regiment will uniformly establish a family reception center. Family members must have a letter of introduction from the district and village government when they come. After the regimental political department registers and considers that they can be received, they can be received at the reception center during non-drill time. Family members should not stay in the troops for more than three days. The reception center must be equipped with certain political cadres, responsible for explaining and educating family members, introducing the living conditions of new soldiers in the troops, comforting them, especially explaining current affairs and policies (such as the Regulations on Preferential Treatment for Military Dependents), and mobilizing new soldiers to write letters home to persuade their families not to come and delay their studies.
    VII. Master the Laws of Desertion: It is not easy for new soldiers to join the army, nor is it easy to desert. They have many concerns in their minds. For example, when they left home, they were sent off riding horses and wearing red flowers. They feel ashamed to face people when they return. After joining the army, their families receive preferential treatment from the government as military dependents, and they are afraid that they will not be treated preferentially if they return, and they are afraid that it will be embarrassing for the village to send them back. Generally, the laws of desertion are after evening roll call, before morning exercises, during business trips, when on sentry duty, after being criticized or stimulated, and when mistakes are discovered by the organization. When a backward new soldier develops an intention to escape, he often shows a suspicious sign, either suddenly becoming active or suddenly becoming depressed, carrying all the things he brought from home with him, even wearing layers of clothes, or depositing his luggage with the families of ordinary people. We must be vigilant about the subtle movements and ideological changes of new soldiers. When encountering this situation, we must immediately talk to him, educate him, seek the reasons, and solve the problem.
    VIII. Properly Handle New Soldiers Who Return to the Team: After a new soldier who has deserted is mobilized to return to the team, the cadres should first discuss the reasons for his desertion, study his psychological changes, and decide on the handling method according to the severity of the circumstances. Or convene a military meeting to welcome the return, and ask the deserter to confess and reflect frankly at the meeting. For deserters who organize desertion and do not confess thoroughly, hold a struggle meeting, where everyone raises criticisms and exposes mistakes to make him realize his errors. When dealing with the problem, we must prevent over-handling, which makes deserters afraid to return to the team; or under-handling, which makes them think that it is okay to come back after deserting. In general, after educating deserters, they should still be sent back to their original team to work, but they must undergo a detailed political review.
    IX. Strictly Be Vigilant Against the Sabotage Activities of Espionage Agents: Under the shameless espionage policy of the Kuomintang, saboteurs constantly take the opportunity to infiltrate our army to carry out sabotage and disintegration activities. We must always raise our revolutionary vigilance and pay attention to the emotional changes of new soldiers. In the troops, it is forbidden to spread rumors. If rumors are heard, investigate the root cause to prevent them from spreading and poisoning, and confusing morale. Internally and externally, extensively expose the criminal facts of the reactionaries and the shameless rumor-mongering tricks of the Kuomintang secret agents to create a mass anti-espionage movement. However, as the people's awareness increases, the vast majority of new soldiers are good. We must not relax our vigilance in the slightest, nor can we have "grass and trees are all soldiers," and we must be cautious in investigating matters. Once saboteurs are discovered, they are not terrible, but the most harmful are hidden elements. Guaranteeing the purity of the troops' composition is one of the important conditions for consolidating new soldiers.
    X. The Fortress Role of the Branch: The company branch is a fortress for consolidating the troops. The Party realizes its political leadership over the troops through the branch. Often, political cadres in the troops do not value local Party members who have newly joined the army, resulting in work losses. For example, when a company had a desertion phenomenon, the instructor did not know how to cooperate with the branch. As a result, Party members automatically held meetings to find ways, and the instructor even blamed them for not notifying the company headquarters when they held meetings, suspecting that they had escape intentions. The desertion phenomenon in this company was stopped for a long time. In another company, the branch work was tightly grasped, and Party members could reflect problems in a timely manner, making the company's political sense very sharp and ensuring the consolidation of the entire company. For the branch to play its role, Party members must not be detached from the masses, and Party members must be prevented from being arrogant, having mountain stronghold mentality, and being too embarrassed to expose those who intend to escape to the organization. This requires strengthening Party education and entrusting the responsibility of consolidating the troops to the branch.
    XI. Improve Life and Strengthen Cultural and Recreational Work: The company should set up an economic committee, absorbing cadres and active elements to participate in the management of food, organize production, plan savings, and improve life, so that new soldiers often understand the economic situation of the company and publish accounts on time. At the same time, in conjunction with the improvement of material life, we must strengthen cultural and recreational work, hold entertainment evenings, and many talents will be discovered among new soldiers, such as folk songs, clapper talk, shadow puppetry, ventriloquism, silk and bamboo instrument playing, chess, etc., so that the lives of new soldiers are not boring, and everyone gets along happily, like a big family. The club's blackboard newspaper should regularly praise and broadcast various models, report on victory news, and immerse the entire company in a pleasant and exciting atmosphere, striving for progress.
    XII. Care for the Sick: People who are sick are also prone to ideological confusion. Among the new soldiers, some pretend to be sick to escape, or become homesick and escape after being sick. Therefore, to consolidate new soldiers, we must pay attention to taking care of the sick, especially because there are phenomena of pretending to be sick, we must not misunderstand comrades who are really sick as pretending to be sick. Some who pretend to be sick are well taken care of and are moved, confess themselves, and make rapid progress; some who are really sick are better consolidated because they are well taken care of, and they influence others through them. For example, a new soldier named Yang Qinghe in a certain company suffered from severe sores on his back, which were cured by a doctor's surgery and medication. He said, "It's still good to be a soldier. At home, I would not have been able to afford medical treatment for this sore, and it would have been fatal!" Many new soldiers felt that the troops treated them better than their families. This company has never had a deserter.

　　新战士政治工作经验
    南飞
    新战士入伍后，巩固部队是政治工作中的主要部分。新战士常常因为动员方式不周到，觉悟程度不高，对时局认识不足，生活习惯的骤然改变，想家，怕牺牲，有时破坏分子乘机混入捣乱，容易发生逃亡现象。应该怎样才能巩固新战士呢？
    一、巩固部队的三个基本环节：打通思想、解决问题。群众路线是巩固新战士的三个基本环节。首先要了解新战士思想矛盾的基本点及其变化过程，经过启发耐心说服教育，推动其内心变化，解开思想疙瘩，使之完全自觉参军的光荣，这是第一步。同时，与地方干部协同解决新战士提出的具体合理的问题，要区村干部直接到部队来解决。有时部队解释九十九次不能解决的问题，区村干部来后几句话就解决了。此外巩固新战士不能只依靠几个政工干部，要走群众路线，要相信群众，依靠群众，充分发动群众，把巩固部队任务交给群众；只要群众的积极性发挥出来，会发现更多更好的巩固办法。我问过一个副班长怎样巩固新战士，他的答复是：“遇有新战士情绪不高，找他谈话，发现问题，及时解决，不能拖延；自己谈了不中用，让别人去谈谈；再不中用，开会大家谈就可以了。”他这几句话，正说明了三个原则的实际运用。但是打通思想，解决问题，群众力量，三者又必须密切结合，缺一不可。只强调打通思想，叫做说空话；只强调解决问题，会变成收买；只强调群众力量，会变成强迫。
    二、群众监督：１、检举逃亡分子。由群众在军人大会上把有逃亡象征的可疑分子公开揭发出来，被揭发的人常常反当场宣誓，提出要向揭发他的人比赛不逃亡。２、制订联合公约。在军人大会上，你一句我一句大家来讲，中心都是宣誓不开小差，把全连的意见集合起来，成为公约，全连通过，大家遵守。３、建立互助组，由大家自由找对象，每人找二三人组成互助小组。这样一来，当使落后分子感到孤立无人互助。被迫去找排长班长担保参加互助组。互助组主要是互助学习，有相互制约作用。４、发动班为单位的巩固部队挑战竞赛。提出条件，互助挑战，并且经常不断的选举公布奖励巩固部队的模范。此外，如以营为单位组织纪律纠查队，召开反逃亡批评检讨会，动员群众想办法，克服个别新战士的不稳情绪，均能使新战士情绪巩固。
    三、发扬部队的优良作风：对新战士开始时要适当的加强军事管理，同时加强政治教育，要根绝打骂现象，取消单纯惩罚主义，养成尊干爱兵的团结作风，使新战士体验到革命军队的温暖。我们曾经采用而且收到实际效果的管理办法，是用战士巩固战士，积极分子巩固落后分子，互助制约，加强军队驻地及驻地周围的村子工作，严格部队请假销假制度，规定家属接见办法，都起巩固新战士的积极作用。
    四、大胆使用积极分子：新战士中的积极分子，有真假两种，主要看他能否代表群众要求及工作的实际效果。
    有一种社会习气较大的人，为了掩护逃跑，表现出逢迎上级，在某些时候表现积极，但有冷热病，与群众关系也不会很密切，这往往是假的。真积极分子则与群众关系密切，群众也爱护他，工作上踏踏实实。领导上要随时发现与提拔新的积极分子，去代替已经消极了的分子。有些积极分子，还要观测其在某些问题上表现积极，在某些问题上表现不积极，规定具体的不同的使用办法，这就是要慎重了解其积极的原因与特点，如果使用不洽当时，会起反作用的。对落后分子，要用积极分子带头前进，用干部的模范作用去影响他，召集他们开进步会，鼓励进步，必要时选他为互助组长或副组长，在行政上提升为副班长，也会起到推动进步的作用。积极分子逐渐增多，落后分子逐渐减少，中间分子就会向积极分子方面转化，部队会更巩固。
    五、发扬地方干部与群众领袖的作用：参军动员时，总有一部分地方干部与群众领袖带头参军，到部队里后，他们与新战士群众仍保持着密切的联系，经过他们联系群众，团结群众、巩固部队会起到良好的作用。部队要相信他们，关心他们，大胆交给他们责任，不能因为他们不懂军事，不熟悉部队生活，就瞧不起他们。部队要切实掌握这一部分地方干部与群众领袖、告诉他们不仅带头参军，也要带头训练，带头上前线打仗，否则就要失掉干部地位与领袖地位，打通他们的思想，使之安心工作。
    六、做好家属招待工作：家属问题，是巩固新战士工作中的大问题。新战士到部队以后，开始时期，总有许多新战士的家属来探望。家属来，一般总是要求新战士请假回家，或者提出一大堆解决不了的困难问题，使新战士情绪不安。所以，要严格规定家属接见制度，不准在班里或连里接见家属，由团统一成立家属招待所。家属来了须持有区村政府的介绍信，经团政治处登记认为可以接见，在不防害操课时间内，到招待所接见，家属在部队不超过三天。招待所须设置一定的政治干部，负责对家属进行解释教育，介绍新战士在部队中的生活情形，予以安慰，特别讲解时事问题与政策（如优待军属条例），并动员新战士写信回家，劝家人不要来耽误学习。
    七、掌握逃亡规律：新战士参军不易，逃亡亦不易，他思想上有很多顾虑。如离家时骑马佩红送出来，回后感到没脸见人，参军后家里作为军属受政府优待，回去怕不优待了，怕村里送回来不好看。一般逃亡的规律，是在晚点名后，早操前，出差放哨时，受批评受刺击以后，犯了错误为组织上发觉时。落后的新战士发展到企图逃走时，常表露出一种可疑的象征，不是表现得突然积极，就是表现得突然消沉，把从家里带来的东西全部带在身上，连衣服亦一层又一层地穿起来，或者向老百姓家庭寄存包袱。要警惕新战士的细小动作表现与思想变化，遇到这种情状，须立刻找他谈话，进行教育，寻求原因，解决问题。
    八、妥善处理归队的新战士：逃亡的新战士动员归队后，首先由干部讨论他开小差的原因，研究其心理变化，依据情节轻重，决定处理办法。或召集军人大会，欢迎归队，要逃亡战士在大会上坦白反省。对组织逃亡与坦白不彻底的归队战士，开斗争会，大家提出批评，揭发错误，使他觉悟，在处理问题时，要防止处理过重，使逃亡战士慑于归队；或处理过轻，认为开小差回来没事的两种偏向。一般的对逃亡战士教育以后，仍宜送回原队工作，但必须经过详细的政治检查。
    九、严格警惕奸细分子的破坏活动：在国民党无耻的特务政策下面，不断有破坏分子乘隙潜入我军，进行破坏瓦解活动，须随时提高革命警觉性，注意新战士的情绪变化。在部队中禁止小广播，听到谣言，究根追底，防止蔓延流毒，惑乱士气。对内对外，广泛揭发反动派的罪恶事实，与国特的无耻造谣花样，造成群众性的反奸运动。但是，人民觉悟日益提高，新战士中绝大多数，都是好的，既不能丝毫放松警觉，亦不能有“草木皆兵”，遇事要谨慎调查。破坏分子一经发觉，并不可怕，而危害最大的是暗藏分子。保证部队成分纯洁，是巩固新战士的重要条件之一。
    十、支部的堡垒作用：连队支部，是巩固部队的堡垒，党就是经过支部来实现对部队的政治领导的。往往部队政工干部，不重视新参军的地方党员，造成工作损失。比如有一个连发生了逃亡现象，指导员不知道与支部配合，结果党员自动开会想办法，指导员还责备他们开会不通知连部，怀疑其有逃跑企图，这个连里的逃亡现象，很久才得到制止。另一个连，支部工作抓的紧，党员能及时反映问题，使连的政治感觉非常锐敏，保证了全连的巩固。支部要起作用，必须党员不脱离群众，防止党员骄傲，山头情绪，碍于情面不向组织上揭发企图逃亡的分子，这就需要加强党内教育，把巩固部队的责任交给支部。
    十一、改善生活，加强文化娱乐工作：连队设经济委员会，吸收干部与积极分子参加管理伙食，组织生产，计划节约，改善生活，使新战士经常了解连队的经济情况，按时公布账目。同时，配合着物质生活的改善，要加强文化娱乐工作，开游艺晚会，新战士中会发现不少这样人才，如小调、快板、皮簧、口技、丝竹乐器的弹奏、奕棋等，使新战士生活不枯燥，大家愉快相处，有如大家庭。俱乐部的黑板报，经常表扬广播各种模范，报导胜利消息，使全连浸润在愉快的兴奋的空气之中，争先进步。
    十二、关心病号：有病的人，思想上亦容易混乱，新战士中往往有装病逃走，或病后引起想家而逃走的。所以，巩固新战士，不能不注意照顾病号，特别是不能因为有装病现象，就误解真正有病的同志为装病。有些装病的，由于照顾得好，受了感动，自己坦白了很快的进步；有些真病的，由于医疗照顾得好，更加巩固了，而且经过他们去影响别人。比如某连新战士杨清和背上患疮很重，经医生开刀上药治愈，就说：“还是当兵好，在家害上这个疮，无力求医，非要命不行！”许多新战士感到部队待自己比家人还亲，这个连一直没有一个逃亡的。
