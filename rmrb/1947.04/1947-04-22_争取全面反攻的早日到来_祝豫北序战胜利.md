Strive for the Early Arrival of a Full-Scale Counteroffensive
Congratulate the Victory of the Pre-Battle in Northern Henan

On the 18th of this month, our Jinji-Luyu People's Liberation Army, on the east side of the Pinghan Railway in northern Henan, in the horseshoe-shaped area north of the confluence of the Qi River and the Wei River, annihilated the majority of the 199th Brigade of the 66th Division of Wang Zhonglian's direct line of Chiang's troops, the entire 49th Brigade (i.e., the Rapid Second Column), and the entire 379th Regiment of the 127th Brigade of the 47th Division, capturing over 8,000 enemy soldiers including the brigade commander Li Shouzhen, and killing or wounding over 4,000 enemy soldiers, totaling over 12,000 enemy soldiers from more than two brigades. This not only caused a major change in the war situation in northern Henan, allowing us to completely seize the initiative, but also, coupled with the continuous victories of our Taiyue troops on the Tongpu Railway, brought our entire war situation in the area into a new stage, meaning that we have completely grasped the initiative in the war.

After our army proactively withdrew from Yan'an, the headquarters of the People's Liberation Army pointed out to the people of the whole country: Chiang Kai-shek's adventurous occupation of Yan'an does not indicate his strength, but rather indicates that his strength is further weakened. In order to unite his internal forces and boost morale, he had to resort to this inferior tactic, which marked the beginning of Chiang Kai-shek's decline. In the near future, our People's Liberation Army will definitely give Chiang's troops a severe blow. Our Jinji-Luyu People's Liberation Army, encouraged by this call, achieved simultaneous victories on the Tongpu and Pinghan lines in late March and early April, giving Chiang Hu's troops an initial blow. We pointed out: "The initial offensives of our army on the Tongpu and Pinghan lines mainly aim to destroy Chiang's railway lines, eliminate a large number of local puppet bandits, seize a large amount of war materials, recover large areas of lost territory, and lay the foundation for annihilating a large number of Chiang's troops in the future. A new and more fierce offensive is about to come." However, this straightforward warning of ours was ignored by Wang Zhonglian and his ilk. After Chiang Kai-shek and Chen Cheng's mad cries of "eliminate the Communist Party" and "smash the CCP rebels," these irrational anti-communist and anti-people generals, like dreamers, even boasted about what "my strategy will be seen in three to five days" and "eliminate Liu Bocheng's remnants," slapping their faces to look impressive, and actually launched an adventurous advance. What exactly was the clumsy "strategy" of Wang Zhonglian and his ilk?

When our army cleared the outposts of Xinxiang in late March, pressing close to the Xinxiang city walls and shaking northern Henan, Chiang Kai-shek hurriedly transferred two brigades of the 66th Division, the only reserve force guarding Wuhan, to reinforce northern Henan, and also gathered the 49th Brigade, which was guarding the Daocing Railway, in Xinxiang, attempting to defend to the death. The so-called "my strategy" was originally just a synonym for being outwardly strong but inwardly weak. At this time, our army immediately turned north, capturing Qixian in one fell swoop, clearing the outposts of Ji, Tang, and Anyang, sweeping away local diehards and puppets such as Cheng Daosheng, Hu Quanlu, Si Huasheng, Liu Lexian, and Sun Dianying, and thoroughly destroying the railway between Anyang and Qi, preparing an excellent battlefield for annihilating Chiang's troops and welcoming the "strategy" designed by Wang Zhonglian. Anyang was isolated, and Tangyin was in dire straits. Sure enough, Wang Zhonglian panicked and personally urged the 66th and 40th Divisions to advance north along the Pinghan Railway, with the 32nd Division and the entire 2nd Army following as reserves, attempting to restore traffic between Anyang and Xinxiang and lift the siege of Tangyin. However, he was as timid as a mouse and dared not advance. On April 10th, he advanced to Yigou, south of Tangyin, and upon discovering our resistance, he fled in panic. The tactics used by Wang Zhonglian and his ilk were probably the latest tactics invented by the Kuomintang Ministry of National Defense, namely the "gap-drilling tactics," which were actually escape tactics. After the escape, Gu Zhutong still strictly supervised their northward advance to lift the siege of Tangyin. Wang Zhonglian then sent the above-mentioned troops and added a part of the Sichuan Army to advance north again on the 14th, but he was still extremely panicked, attempting to bypass the east side of Qixian and advance north by roundabout route. As soon as he crossed the Qi River, he fell into our army's encirclement and was completely annihilated in one fell swoop. The "strategy" designed by Wang Zhonglian completely collapsed upon contact with "Liu Bocheng's remnants." These brainless and foolish anti-communist Chiang's troops would never realize their own shocking stupidity until they were beaten black and blue.

We have completely grasped the initiative in the war and won the transformation of the war situation. The emergence of this situation is not accidental. In the nine months of victorious patriotic self-defense war, our entire commanders and fighters, and political workers, have been able to skillfully apply Chairman Mao's strategic guiding principles. Our army's equipment, relying on the American weapons sent by Chiang Kai-shek, has been almost completely re-equipped and further improved compared to the Anti-Japanese War period. In the troops, whether in combat education and training, consolidating new soldiers, or winning over prisoners of war, the mass line has been fully implemented, and a widespread campaign of meritorious service competition has greatly improved the awareness of every soldier, and a large number of combat heroes have emerged. This is the solid foundation for being invincible in attack and invulnerable in defense. At the same time, after the start of the Self-Defense War, the people of our entire area have been mobilized. War support, production, military industry, and thrift work have all been done very well. In particular, we have completed the great historical task of land reform amidst the sound of artillery fire. Millions of emancipated peasants have consciously and enthusiastically joined the army and participated in the war to defend their homes and fields. This is the complete and powerful rear of our combat system and a strong backing for the continuous victories on the front line. With such an army and such people, working together with one heart, the liberated areas and the People's Liberation Army are forever invincible, and Chiang Kai-shek will surely be defeated in front of us.

On the Chiang's army side, the situation is completely opposite. Insufficient strength, declining morale, and wrong strategic guidance have also promoted our gaining the initiative in the war. After this major victory in northern Henan, Chiang's army is in an even more unfavorable situation: (1) Its forces are becoming weaker and weaker, empty everywhere. It is no longer able to draw troops from other places to reinforce. The Chiang's troops guarding northern Henan are completely in a passive position of being beaten. (2) Due to its insufficient strength, and because we have eliminated a large number of local stubborn and puppet armed forces and uprooted Chiang's roots in the local area, the Chiang's troops in northern Henan are even more isolated, and their weaknesses are more exposed and prominent, giving us the opportunity to annihilate them at any time. (3) Our Jinji-Luyu battlefields can cooperate and echo each other, making Chiang's army lose sight of one thing while attending to another. In particular, the fierce development of guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines in the Jinan Triangle area, the southern bank of the Yellow River in Jiluyu, and the Yuwansu area has nailed Chiang's army to the cross (i.e., the cross formed by several vertical and horizontal railways), compressing Chiang's army and preventing it from acting freely. Once it acts, its weaknesses will be exposed, giving us the opportunity to defeat them one by one. (4) Chiang's army originally had no just cause and its morale was extremely low. Under the heavy blows of our army, its morale has become even lower. For example, the 379th Regiment of the 127th Brigade was greatly shocked by the power of our army this time and neatly led the team to surrender their weapons. This situation will become even more common in the future.

The northern Henan campaign is only the prelude to the spring offensive of our Jinji-Luyu People's Liberation Army, and more exciting programs are yet to come. Chiang's army has no reserves to mobilize, and each one eliminated is one less. Under Chiang Kai-shek's wrong political and strategic guidance, there is no way to save this. The day of our full-scale counteroffensive is coming, and we hereby call on the soldiers and civilians of our entire area to make persistent efforts, be neither arrogant nor slack! Vigorously expand the results of the battle, win again after victory, add merit upon merit, and strive for the early arrival of a full-scale counteroffensive.

### 争取全面反攻的早日到来  祝豫北序战胜利

    争取全面反攻的早日到来
    祝豫北序战胜利
    本月十八日我晋冀鲁豫人民解放军在豫北平汉线东侧，淇河、卫河汇合处以北的臼形地带，歼灭蒋军嫡系王仲廉部六十六师一九九旅大部，四十九旅（即快速第二纵队）全部，四十七师一二七旅三七九团全部，俘敌旅长李守正以下八千余人，毙伤敌四千余人，共计歼敌两个多旅一万二千余人；这不仅使豫北战局发生重大变化，我完全掌握了主动权，加上同蒲线我太岳部队连续不断的胜利，我区整个战局转入新的阶段，即我已完全掌握了战争的主动权。
    在我军主动撤离延安后，人民解放军总部，曾向全国人民指出：蒋介石冒险占领延安并不表示其力量强大，而是表示其力量更加削弱。为了团结其内部，振奋其人心，不得不出此下策，这是标帜着蒋介石已开始走下坡路。在不久的将来，我人民解放军一定会给蒋军一个厉害看。我晋冀鲁豫人民解放军就是在这一号召的鼓舞下，曾于三月底，四月初同时取得同蒲、平汉双捷，给蒋胡军以初步打击，我们曾指出：“同蒲、平汉我军的初期攻势，主要在于毁灭蒋军铁道线，肃清地方大批伪匪，缴获大量战争物资，收复大块失地，奠定今后大量歼灭蒋军有生力量之基础，新的更猛烈的攻势就要到来。”可是我们这一率直的警告，未被王仲廉辈所睬理，这些失掉理性的反共反人民的将军们却在蒋介石陈诚“消灭共产党”、“粉碎”“中共叛军”的狂吠后，又梦呓一般的吹什么“三五日内看我的谋略”，“消灭刘伯承残部”，打肿嘴巴充胖子，居然就作冒险的进军了。王仲廉辈的笨拙的“谋略”究竟是什么呢？
    当我军于三月底肃清新乡外围据点，迫近新乡城垣，豫北震动时，蒋介石则急调其后方仅有的守备武汉的六十六师两个旅增援豫北，调守备道清路的四十九旅，亦螺集新乡，企图死守，所谓“我的谋略”，原来不过是外强中干的代名词而已。此时，我军即挥戈北向，一举攻克淇县，肃清汲、汤、安阳外围据点；扫荡地方顽伪程道生、扈全禄、司华生、刘乐仙、孙殿英等部，并彻底破坏了安、淇间的铁路，为消灭蒋军有生力量准备下大好战场，以迎接王仲廉所设计的“谋略”。安阳孤立，汤阴吃紧，果然王仲廉发慌了，亲自督促六十六师、四十师沿平汉线北上，以卅二师整二军等为预备队随后跟进，企图恢复安阳、新乡间的交通，解汤阴的围；但又胆小如鼠，不敢前进，于四月十日进至汤阴南宜沟一带，一发现我之抵抗，即仓惶溃退。王仲廉辈所用的战术，大概就是国民党国防部所发明的最新战术，即“钻隙战术”，实际就是逃跑战术。在逃跑之后，顾祝同仍严督其北进，解汤阴之围，王仲廉乃于十四日又以上述部队并加派川军一部北进，但仍极恐慌万状，企图绕道淇县东侧，迂回北进；刚过淇河，即陷入我军包围，一举即遭全部歼灭。王仲廉所设计的“谋略”，与“刘伯承残部”一经接触，即全军溃败；这些没有头脑的愚蠢的反共蒋军们不到打得他头破血流的时候，他是绝不会了解到他自己的愚蠢，会是这样的惊人。
    我完全掌握了战争的主动权，赢得战局转换。这种局面的出现，并不是偶然的，在九个月的胜利的爱国自卫战争中，我全体指战员、政工人员，已能够熟练地运用毛主席的战略指导原则，我军装备依靠蒋介石送来的美式武器，差不多已经全部重新改装，较之抗战期间又进一步的提高了。在部队中无论作战教育训练，巩固新战士、争取俘虏都充分的发挥了群众路线，普遍的开展了立功竞赛运动，大大提高了每个战士的觉悟，涌现出大批战斗英雄。这就是攻无不克，战无不胜的坚实基础。同时在自卫战争开始后，我全区人民已经动员起来了。战勤、生产、军工、节约等工作，都做的很好。特别是我们在炮火声中完成了土地改革的伟大历史任务，千百万翻身农民，为了保家保田均自觉地踊跃参军参战。这是我们作战体系的完整有力的后方，是前线不断获胜的有力后盾。有了这样的军队与这样的人民，戮力同心，解放区和人民解放军就是永远不可战胜的，蒋介石一定会在我们面前被击败。
    而在蒋军方面情况，则与我完全相反，后力不足，士气衰颓，战略指导方针错误，这也促进了我获得战争的主动权。在这次豫北大捷之后，蒋军更处于不利的情况：（一）兵力更形薄弱，到处空虚，他已无力再从其他地方抽兵增援，豫北蒋军守备部队，完全陷于挨打被动。（二）由于其兵力不足，以及我又消灭了大量地方顽伪武装，拔掉蒋军在地方上的根子，使豫北蒋军更加处于孤立，弱点更加暴露、突出，给我随时歼灭的机会。（三）我晋冀鲁豫各个战场均能相互配合相互呼应，使蒋军顾此失彼，特别是晋南三角地带、冀鲁豫黄河南岸及豫皖苏敌后游击战争的猛烈开展，把蒋军钉死在十字架上（即数条纵横铁路所形成的十字架上），压缩蒋军不得自由行动，一行动，弱点即暴露，即给我各个击破的机会。（四）蒋军本来师出无名，士气极不振，在我大军重击下，士气益不振。例如此次一二七旅三七九团就是在我军威力面前大为震摄，很整齐的带队缴械的，以后此种情形将会更加增多。
    豫北战役仅仅是我晋冀鲁豫人民解放军春季攻势的一个序幕，更精彩的节目，还在后面。蒋军已无可抽调的后援，被消灭一个就少一个，这在蒋介石错误的政略战略指导下，是毫无办法挽救的。我全面反攻的日子就要到了，特号召我全区军民要再接再厉，勿骄勿懈！大力扩张战果，胜了再胜，功上加功，争取全面反攻的早日到来。
