    【Special Dispatch from this Newspaper】The Second Replenishment Regiment of the Military Region has achieved outstanding results in consolidating new soldiers, and the leaders of the Military Region have issued a circular of commendation. The Second Replenishment Regiment of the Military Region received new soldiers on October 20th and officially held an enlistment ceremony on October 27th. After three weeks of training, and in nearly a month's time, only one person was lost, making it a model for consolidating troops. The leaders of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Military Region have issued a special circular of commendation. The experience of the regiment in consolidating new soldiers is introduced as follows: 1. Cadres of the Second Replenishment Regiment are generally at ease in their work and wholeheartedly want to do a good job in consolidating new soldiers; cadres are united internally and do not create personal problems; the regimental committee is sound, ideological leadership is strong, and they humbly learn from the masses. 2. Implement the mass line method, first carry out a movement to pour out grievances to relatives (the People's Liberation Army), and enlighten the masses to repay their gratitude (to the Communist Party, the Eighth Route Army), protect the fields, and defeat old Chiang. Ninety-nine percent of the new soldiers in a certain company carried out crying and pouring out grievances, and their emotions were激昂 [jī áng - impassioned], then on this basis, they swore to launch a large-scale military training movement. The leadership had a clear direction, and the cadres specifically divided the work and went deep into the masses. Once experience was discovered, it could be spread throughout the regiment in one day. Cadres cared for the lives of the soldiers, donating their own healthcare funds to sick new soldiers, touching the new soldiers in many ways, and making the new soldiers quickly develop a passionate feeling for the army. At the same time, through the masses themselves, the ideological concerns of the masses were dispelled. 3. For replenishment regiments that do not meet the above two conditions, even if the quality of the new soldiers is good, the consolidation work will be extremely different.
    【Special Dispatch from this Newspaper】The Seventeenth Division of the Northwest Democratic Allied Army's Thirty-eighth Army, practiced martial arts while fighting, which improved combat effectiveness and gave them confidence in storming fortifications. After the Hui County Zhanghutop and Guantai battles, the commanders and fighters of the Seventeenth Division, in order to improve their combat effectiveness, unanimously requested to use the intervals between battles to carry out military training. After receiving combat experience, the training focused on tactical study in addition to general technical training. Exercises combined with actual combat were carried out for ambush warfare, encounter warfare, village attack warfare, and night attack warfare, and specialized exercises were carried out, especially for storming fortifications (attacking cities and street fighting). In coaching, all troops used the mass line teaching method, held soldiers' staff meetings, and conducted universal discussions and research, which promoted the enthusiasm and creativity of commanders and fighters, and thus created new methods in technology. For example, for destroying deer fences, barbed wire, and bunkers, crossing outer trenches, setting up springboards and ladders on city walls, each regiment had new methods. The movements were simple, quick, and steady, suitable for combat, and solved the problem of communication and liaison, which was more difficult to do well in street fighting. They also thought of ways to encircle and annihilate the enemy's core fortifications. In particular, after the Zhaojia Factory battle, the division experienced the great role of mutual aid groups in combat. After the call of the division committee, mutual aid groups were generally established and their education in military training was strengthened. Great importance was also attached to the exercise of physical strength and foot strength. Every morning and evening, they practiced marching and forced marching. Recently, the military training during combat intervals has been summarized, and it is generally believed that in the exercise of storming fortifications, the command skills of commanders have been improved, and the combatants' confidence in storming fortifications has been strengthened. After the training, the troops generally requested to seek out the enemy and storm fortifications. Secondly, the marching ability has been greatly enhanced, and there have been no dropouts. Various technologies have also made significant progress, especially the flat shooting of mortars, which has become much more reliable. (Wang Wenzhi)
