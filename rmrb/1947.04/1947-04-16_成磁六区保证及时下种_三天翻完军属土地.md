　　[Report from this newspaper in Southern Hebei, 14th] The liberated peasants of Southern Hebei are giving priority to helping the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers with plowing and spring farming. In Chengcí Sixth District, the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers have a total of 2,230 mu of land that needs to be cultivated on their behalf. To ensure that their land is sown in a timely manner, district cadres went separately to coordinate with village cadres to rationally organize the livestock in the entire district, giving them a rush to plow the land. All the land was plowed in three days. The farmers cultivating on behalf of others discussed, "People are fighting Old Chiang at the front; we should plow the land well, so that they have no worries in their hearts." Wei Village in Wei County took the lead in organizing the village's livestock to cultivate on behalf of military families and deliver fertilizer. In a four-day blitz, all ten families in the village needing cultivation on their behalf, totaling 2.7 qing of land, have now been cultivated.

　　成磁六区保证及时下种
    三天翻完军属土地
    【本报冀南十四日电】冀南翻身农民，尽先帮助烈军工属翻土、春耕。成磁六区烈军工属共有二千二百三十亩土地需要代耕，区干部为保证他们的土地及时下种，便分头协同村干合理组织全区牲口，给他们突击翻地，三天内所有土地全部翻完，代耕农民纷纷议论：“人家在前方打老蒋，咱应该把土翻得好，使他们心中没牵挂”。威县魏家村首先组织全村畜力给军属代耕、送粪，突击四天，全村十家需代耕地二顷七十余亩，现已代耕完毕。
