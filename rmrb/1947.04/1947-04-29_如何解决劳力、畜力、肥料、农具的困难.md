　　How to Solve the Difficulties of Labor, Animal Power, Fertilizer, and Farm Implements
　　·Lian Yishan·
    The following suggestions are offered for reference in solving various difficulties related to labor, animal power, fertilizer, and farm implements.
    1.  Solving the problem of labor shortage: A village cadre at the Heshun County Expanded Cadre Production Mobilization Conference said: "The reason our village has a labor shortage is mainly because: (1) Work that cadres can do by themselves often requires five or six people at home, and a task that can be done in one hour takes half a day or a whole day. (2) Unnecessary errands waste a lot of civilian labor. Because of these two reasons, production did not go well last year." In order to solve the problem of wasting civilian labor to benefit production: First, cadres should uniformly lead, specifically divide responsibilities, save time, and lead the masses in production. Second, all unnecessary errands must be strictly prohibited (especially during the busy farming season), which can save a lot of labor.
    2.  Solving the difficulty of animal power: The lack of animal power is alarming. One team in Heshun County calculated a shortage of more than 2,000 head of livestock. The solutions to this difficulty are: (1) The spring plowing loans allocated by the Administrative Office (for the entire Taihang area) are 20,000,000 yuan. These loans should be used appropriately, and as much as possible should be used to buy livestock, preferably through joint purchases and joint feeding. (2) During this urgent spring plowing and planting season, livestock from various government agencies, organizations, and troops should help the masses in the villages where they are stationed or nearby villages with planting as much as possible. (3) Organize people to pull plows. (4) Organize and promote mutual aid credit loans to purchase livestock from livestock-producing areas and from liberated and guerrilla-occupied areas. (5) Use livestock to solve the problem of equivalent value. (6) During spring plowing and planting, try to use as little animal power as possible for war participation and transportation, or reduce the amount of voluntary transportation as much as possible.
    3.  Solving the lack of fertilizer: Before the realization of "land to the tiller," the peasants who had turned over were mostly selling their labor and being exploited. After the turn over, they have just recovered the land from the hands of feudal landlords, and there is a severe shortage of fertilizer. This difficulty is very common in every region. Insufficient manure in the fields is no different from people not having enough to eat. To solve this difficulty, we must first promote and create all kinds of fertilizer production campaigns: (1) Launch the large-scale cleaning campaign of 1943 again, which will not only solve the fertilizer difficulty but also achieve cleanliness and hygiene and prevent epidemics. (The large-scale cleaning campaign in Wuxiang solved 16% of the fertilizer problem.) (2) Improve latrines, dig out the bottom of the latrines, and add water to the latrines to mix human waste fertilizer. (3) Rebuild dams and dig chimneys. (4) Apply soybean cakes and soybean fertilizer. (5) Use part of the loan to purchase fertilizer. For example, applying ferrous sulfate and red alum to the land can not only act as fertilizer but also loosen the soil and kill insects. (6) Make fertilizer preparations for next year and wheat fields, produce a large amount of wormwood fertilizer, and raise a large number of sheep and pigs and open workshops.
    4.  Solving the difficulty of farm implements: (1) First, break the old static mindset of iron and woodworkers—staying in cities, towns, or villages. Consciously organize them to travel around and repair farm implements and make new farm implements for the peasants in each village. (2) Organize mutual aid to purchase and improve tools to increase their effectiveness. (3) Promote apprenticeship to train workers and solve the shortage of workers.

　　如何解决劳力、畜力、肥料、农具的困难
    ·连一山·
    解决劳、畜、肥及农具的各种困难，有以下几点意见提供参考。
    一、解决劳力缺乏问题：和顺县扩干生产动员大会上一个村干部说：“俺村劳力困难不因别的，主要是：（一）干部们一个人能办的工作，常是五、六个人在家，一点钟能办的事，不是半天便是一天。（二）不必要的差役，浪费了民力不少。因此二种原因，去年生产搞不好。”为了解决浪费民力以利生产的问题：第一、干部统一领导具体分工负责，节省时间领导群众生产。第二、一切不必要的差役，要求严加禁止（特别是农忙之时），这样能节省很大的劳力。
    二、解决畜力困难：畜力的缺乏为数惊人，单和顺一队计算出缺牲口二千多头，这个困难的解决：（一）行署拨的春耕贷款（全太行区）二万万元，这次贷款应适当的使用，尽量多用在买牲口方面，最好是合伙买、合伙喂养。（二）各机关团体及部队的牲口，在这春耕紧急下种之时，尽量的帮助驻地或附近村群众下种。（三）组织人拉犁。（四）组织发扬互济信用贷款，到产牲口地区及区、顽占区购买牲口。（五）使用牲口解决等价问题。（六）春耕下种之时，参战义运尽量少用畜力或尽量减少义运。
    三、解决肥料的缺乏：翻身农民，在未实现耕者有其田以前，大都是出卖劳力受剥削的；翻身后，刚从封建地主手中收回了土地，肥料大缺，这种困难可说各个地区也很普遍了。地里粪不足和人饭不饱是无分别的。我们解决这一困难，首先要发扬与创造各式各样的造肥运动；（一）再次开展四三年的大扫除运动，既非解决肥料困难，又能做到清洁卫生，防止瘟疫。（武乡大扫除运动解决肥料百分之十六。）（二）改良茅坑，挖茅底，茅坑添水拌圊肥。（三）重新打堰挖烟筒。（四）上豆饼和豆肥。（五）用部分贷款购买肥料。如黑矾红矾上地，不但能顶肥，而且能松土杀虫。（六）作下年和麦地的肥料准备，大量造蒿肥，并且大量养羊养猪及开作坊。
    四、解决农具困难：（一）首先打破铁、木匠工人的老住—城—镇或—村的不动思想。有意识的组织起来巡回，到各村给农民修补农具和造新农具。（二）组织互济购买与改良提高工具的效能。（三）发扬带徒弟培养工人，解决工人的缺乏。
