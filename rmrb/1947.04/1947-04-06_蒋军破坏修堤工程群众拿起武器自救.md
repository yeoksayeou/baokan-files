Xinhua News Agency, Jinji-Hebei-Shandong-Henan, 3rd: Chiang Kai-shek troops entrenched in the Shouzhang and ＠Wu areas are wantonly destroying the masses' dyke repair project. In early March, Chiang Kai-shek troops built bunkers along the Yangji River dyke in Shouzhang, preventing the masses from repairing the dyke and burning more than 1,000 wooden stakes and more than 20,000 kilograms of plastic sheeting. On the 25th, Chiang Kai-shek troops in @Wu County burned all the wood and unfinished stone-carrying boats stored in the county's dyke repair section. Before leaving, they threw shells into the fire to prevent residents from rescuing the materials. 1,500 kilograms of iron nails and more than 60 kilograms of white oil stored by the dyke repair section were looted. Residents along the river were extremely indignant and spontaneously took up arms to defend themselves. Troops from places like Luhutong and Zhangjian (10 li from Yangji) harassed the Chiang Kai-shek troops and have been repelled by the dyke repair masses.
