    Yuebei Prefectural Committee Instructs Qintun and Other Counties
    To Combine Production and Mass Mobilization
    [This newspaper's Taiyue dispatch, 23rd] The Yuebei Prefectural Committee recently issued instructions to Qinxian, Qinyuan, Anze, Tunliu, Changzi, and other counties in the central area, stating briefly: (1) In villages where land reform has been thoroughly completed, feudal forces have been completely eliminated, and cadres have already withdrawn excess gains, production should be resumed immediately. However, it is necessary to check whether problems still exist. (2) In villages where feudal forces have been eliminated but cadres have not yet withdrawn excess gains, production should be the priority while resolving remaining issues. (3) In backward villages, where feudal forces have not been defeated and the masses have not been fully mobilized, the focus should be on continuing to vigorously implement land reform, combined with production. The leadership must have a good grasp of both production and land reform. In addition, constant preparations should be made for participating in the war, frequent war participation education should be carried out, and war participation organizations should be rectified, so that war, production, and the land reform movement are integrated into a cohesive whole. Based on the above arduous tasks, all levels should adopt a comprehensive leadership approach.

    岳北地委指示沁屯等县
    生产群运结合
    【本报太岳廿三日电】岳北地委近对腹心地区沁县、沁源、安泽、屯留、长子等县发出指示，略称：（一）土地改革彻底完成村庄，封建势力已被彻底消灭，干部业已退出多得果实，应立即转入生产，但须注意检查是否仍有问题。（二）封建势力已消灭而干部多得果实尚未退出之村庄，应以生产为主解决遗留问题。（三）落后村庄，封建势力未打垮，群众未充分发动，应以继续大力贯彻土地改革为主、结合生产。领导上对生产与土地改革须很好掌握。此外应经常准备参战，经常进行参战教育，整顿参战组织，使战争生产与土地改革运动三位一体的结合起来。根据上述繁重任务，各级应采取一揽子领导方式。
