　　Since the opening of the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference, the foreign ministers, assistant foreign ministers, auxiliary and advisory bodies have been meeting for five weeks. During this period, their agenda, the progress of the meeting, and the policies of the four powers have become the focus of world attention. The agenda for the first two weeks of the Foreign Ministers Conference was to review the work reports of the Allied Control Council for Germany, and the agenda for the last three weeks was to conduct extensive debates on important issues such as the economic principles, political principles, reparations principles, provisional government issues, border issues, Ruhr, Rhineland, and Saar issues, and procedures for concluding a peace treaty in the draft German peace treaty. People all over the world expect the Moscow Conference to achieve its due success, but the lengthy meetings of the past five weeks have solved too few problems. The reason for this situation is mainly that the United States insists on its expansionist policy and is unwilling to solve problems on the basis of world peace and democracy. In essence, the U.S. representative must have the Foreign Ministers Conference solve the German and Austrian issues according to the wishes of the United States; otherwise, they are only willing to discuss various issues at the meeting and are unwilling to seek any fair and reasonable solutions. Marshall exposed this attempt three times within ten days, each time being refuted by Molotov. In essence, the disputes of the past five weeks have been about the observance and alteration of the Potsdam decisions. This clearly exposes the two lines in dealing with the German question: the Soviet line of firmly adhering to the Potsdam decisions and the American line of attempting to alter the decisions.

　　A major event outside the Moscow Conference in the past week was Molotov's letter to Marshall regarding the "unsatisfactory" situation in China. Molotov clearly stated that the Soviet government believes that foreign interference in China's internal affairs, especially the participation of foreign troops in the Chinese civil war, can only encourage internal strife in China and add various difficulties to China's democratic unification. He asked Marshall: "The withdrawal of American troops has not yet been completed. When will the Soviet-American agreement be fulfilled?" Molotov also stated that, in view of this situation, the Soviet government hopes that the foreign ministers currently in Moscow and those who have participated in the Moscow Conference can exchange information regarding the implementation of the agreement on the China issue, both in the past and at present. Marshall has not yet responded to this reasonable request.

　　Marshall and his government are currently in a new crisis, especially in a serious economic situation and a crisis of brewing strikes. The increasingly serious economic situation is entirely due to the Truman government's reactionary economic policies, especially his policy of abolishing price controls, the result of which is the currently increasingly significant vicious inflation and the unstoppable rise in prices. Recently, the situation has become so bad that even the special meeting convened by Truman at the White House on the 9th (attended by cabinet members and senior economic advisors) could not think of any solutions. The direct impact of the economic deterioration is the further decline in workers' lives, and large-scale strikes will naturally arise in due course. The strikes by telephone and coal miners have already given Truman a headache, and now the strikes by steel, automobile, and telegraph workers will be added, which will be an even heavier blow!

　　Although Truman's reactionary bill to "aid" Greece and Turkey is supported by reactionary figures such as Vandenberg and Connally, strong opposition within the United States has forced Vandenberg to propose a disguised "amended" bill to the Senate. During the Senate debate, Pepper and others advocated submitting the matter to the United Nations for resolution. Wallace even visited Europe to visit progressive figures in Britain, Sweden, Norway, and France in order to strengthen their ties with the progressive side of the United States and oppose the reactionary policies of American imperialism. Wallace's trip to Europe will have a great impact. Vandenberg is already a little anxious, comparing Wallace's trip to "an alarming thing." The guilty conscience of the American reactionaries is evident.

　　Another important event in the past week occurred in Britain, which is the increasing awakening of the broad lower-level masses of the Labor Party and the unfolding of their movement against Bevin's harmful foreign policy. Many representatives attending the Cooperative Party annual meeting and the Trades Union Congress during the Easter holidays passed resolutions demanding a change in Bevin's foreign policy. Nearly half of the members of the Cooperative Party opposed Bevin's policy (when the Cooperative Party was at its peak, its membership had grown to over seven million), which is an absolutely undeniable force. This force will play an important role in the upcoming Labor Party conference. What is the "harmful" poison of Bevin's diplomacy? It is the "anti-Soviet" concept that the British people absolutely do not need. However, the general trend is that the people of Britain and the Soviet Union must become closer day by day. Under the pressure of the British people, even the "anti-Soviet" Bevin cannot but carry out the task of revising and supplementing the Anglo-Soviet alliance treaty. The Soviet Supreme Soviet delegation to Britain returned to its country on the 10th after several weeks of visiting Britain. This visit will undoubtedly strengthen the friendship between the two peoples. During the visit, the head of the delegation, Kuznetsov, symbolized Anglo-Soviet relations at a banquet hosted by Attlee, saying: "Since we arrived, it has gradually improved." Yes, it will get better and better, which has become an unshakeable trend.

### 美国反动外交政策  续遭各方猛烈反对  国内经济情势日益加速恶化

　　美国反动外交政策
    续遭各方猛烈反对
    国内经济情势日益加速恶化
    莫斯科外长会议开幕以来，各外长、各外长助理、各辅助及顾问机构，俱各集议五周。在这一期间，他们的议题，会议的进程，以及四强的政策，都成为全世界注意的中心。外长会议前二周的议程，是审查盟国对德管委会的工作报告，后三周的议程，是就德国和约草案中的经济原则、政治原则、赔偿原则、临时政府问题、边界问题、鲁尔、莱茵与萨尔问题、以及缔结和约的程序等重要问题，广泛的进行辩论。全世界的人民都期望莫斯科会议获得应有的成功，可是过去五周冗长的会议，却解决问题太少。这种情况的造成，主要是由于美国坚持其扩张政策，还不愿意在世界和平与民主的基础上解决问题。质言之，美国代表一定要外长会议照美国的愿望解决德奥问题，否则只愿把各种问题在会议上谈一遍，不愿求得任何公平合理的解决。马歇尔在十天之内，三次暴露了这种企图，每次都遭到了莫洛托夫的驳斥。过去五周的争议，就实际上来说，乃是对于波茨顿决定的遵守与窜改问题。这里很清楚的暴露了在处理德国问题上的两条路线，即坚决遵守波茨顿决定的苏联路线，与企图窜改决定的美国路线。
    过去一周莫斯科会议会外的重大事件，是莫洛托夫给马歇尔关于“不能令人满意的”中国情况问题的函件，莫洛托夫明白表示，苏政府认为外国干涉中国之内政，尤其外国军队参加中国内战，仅能鼓励中国之内争，并为中国之民主统一增加各种困难。他向马歇尔发问：“美军之撤退迄未完成，未悉究于何时履行苏美之协议？”莫氏又称：苏政府鉴于此种局势，故在过去及目前，俱希望刻在莫斯科之各外长以及曾参加莫斯科会议之人士，能交换有关履行对中国问题协议之情报。对于这一合理的要求，马歇尔迄未作复。
    马歇尔和他的政府，目前处在新的危机中，特别是处在严重的经济情势与酝酿大罢工的危机中。经济情势的日益严重，完全是由于杜鲁门政府的反动经济政策，尤其是他废除物价管制的政策引起的，其结果就是目前日益显著的恶性通货膨胀，和势不可遏止的物价上涨。最近情势已经坏到这样的地步，以致杜鲁门九日在白官召开的特别会议（参加者为阁员及高级经济顾问）都想不出任何办法。经济上恶化的直接影响，是工人生活的更趋下降，大罢工自然将应时而生。电话和煤矿工人的罢工，已经闹的杜鲁门头痛，现在又将加上钢铁、汽车和电报工人的罢工，这种打击，就将更其沉重了！
    杜鲁门“援助”希土的反动法案，虽然有范登堡和康纳利这些反动派头子撑腰，但是美国内部强烈的反对，使得范登堡也不能不向参院提出伪装的“修正”法案。在参院辩论时，泼贝尔等主张提交联合国解决，华莱士更是为此访问欧洲，去访问英国、瑞典、挪威与法国的进步分子，以便加强他们与美国进步方面之间的联系，来反对美帝国主义的反动政策。华莱士欧洲之行的影响，将是很大的，范登堡已经有点着急了，他把华氏之行比为“惊人之事”。美国反动派的作贼心虚，可见一般。
    过去一周另一重要事件发生在英国，这就是工党广大下层群众的日益觉醒，和他们反对贝文有害外交政策运动的展开。在复活节日出席合作党年会及总工会会议之甚多代表，均通过决议要求改变贝文外交政策，合作党几乎有二分之一的党员反对贝文政策，（当合作党盛极之时，它的党员曾发展到七百多万人）这是一个绝对不容忽视的力量。这种力量在行将召开的工党会议中，会发生重要作用。贝文的外交“有害”的毒素在那里呢？就是英国人民绝对不需要的“仇苏”观念。不过大势所趋，英苏两国人民非日益接近不可，在英国人民的压力之下，就是“仇苏”的贝文，也不能不执行英苏盟约的修改与补充的任务。苏联最高苏维埃访英国在游英数周之后，已于十日返国，这一访问，无疑将加强两国人民的友谊；访问时团长库兹涅佐夫在艾德礼的招待宴会上。曾将天气象征着英苏关系说道：“自我们来到以后，它已逐渐变好起来。”是的，它将更加变好起来，这已经成为确定不移的趋势了。（新华社陕北十四日电）
