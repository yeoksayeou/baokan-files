　　[Report from This Newspaper, Taiyue, 7th] The village chiefs of twenty-five villages in the Fourth District of Yangcheng responded to the Central Bureau's instructions on vigorously promoting production and thrift, making village public expenses entirely self-sufficient through production. The Fourth District convened a symposium for village cadres on production and thrift on the 24th of last month. At the meeting, Su Yu×, the village chief of Nanciying Village, said: "The Central Bureau instructs everyone to struggle hard to welcome the light. We haven't done much to serve the people, but the people bear a lot of burdens for us. I struggled out of poverty, and I know that every grain of food from the people is hard-earned. Therefore, I propose that we no longer eat provisions in the future and reduce the burden on the people." After he finished speaking, all the village chiefs unanimously agreed and decided that the three dou of supply grain per person per month and all office expenses of the village government would be entirely self-sufficient through production. Public grain alone has been reduced by ninety shi in the entire district of twenty-five villages.

　　阳城二十五村执行节约指示
  　村公费一律生产自给
    【本报太岳七日电】阳城四区二十五村村长响应中央局厉行生产节约指示，村公费一律生产自给。四区于上月二十四日召开村干部生产节约座谈会，会议中南次营村长苏玉×说：“中央局指示大家艰苦奋斗迎接光明，咱们为民立功不大，人民为咱们负担可不少。我是从穷苦中挣扎出来的，我知道人民的每颗粮食都是不容易，因此我提议今后咱们不吃给养，减轻人民负担。”话毕，全体村长一致同意，决定每人每月的三斗供给粮及村公所一切办公费一律生产自给。全区二十五村仅公粮即减轻九十石。
