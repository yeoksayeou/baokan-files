    Helping the Masses with Spring Plowing
    To ensure the widespread and timely completion of spring plowing and sowing, leaving no land uncultivated, many rear-area organizations, troops, and schools are actively responding to the Border Region Government's call to help the masses with spring plowing. The Border Region Government and its directly affiliated organs have already helped cultivate over sixty mu in the past week. The Yanggu Public Security Team is helping the masses deliver manure. The directly affiliated organs of the Taiyue Military Region have even decided to organize manpower and livestock to go to the countryside to help the masses. These are all excellent examples.
    Helping the masses with spring plowing this year is of even greater significance than in the past: First, the time for turning the soil and sowing is currently pressing, but many areas are experiencing labor shortages due to busy war duties. Second, many farmers, especially newly emancipated poor farmers, although they have been allocated land, still lack sufficient livestock and tools, which also affects the rapid completion of spring plowing. If rear-area organizations, troops, and schools can spare the time to provide timely assistance, it will not only practically help the masses solve their difficulties but also encourage the productive enthusiasm of the masses. Therefore, we hope that all rear-area organizations, troops, and schools at all levels will quickly participate in this work, ensuring that this year's spring plowing, through the concerted efforts of the rear-area cadres and masses, overcomes difficulties and is successfully completed.

    帮助群众春耕
    保证春耕下种普遍按时完成，不荒一亩地，许多后方机关、部队、学校，正纷纷响应边府号召，帮助群众春耕。边府暨直属机关，一周来已助耕六十余亩，阳谷公安队帮助群众送粪，太岳军区直属机关，且决定组织人力、畜力，下乡帮助群众，这都是很好的。
    今年帮助群众春耕，比过去更有重要意义：第一、目前翻地下种时间紧迫，但不少地区，因战勤繁忙，而感到劳力不足，第二、不少农民，尤其新翻身的贫苦农民，虽然分得了土地，但仍缺乏足够的牲畜与工具，亦影响春耕工作的迅速完成。后方机关、部队、学校，如能挤出时间及时加以帮助，则不仅实际帮助群众解决了困难，而且可鼓舞群众的生产情绪。因此我们希望各后方机关、部队及各级学校，迅速参加这一工作，务使今年春耕，在后方干群一致努力下，克服困难胜利完成。
