Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 26th: A comprehensive war report from the Guanzhong Sub-district of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region states that as a result of the Guanzhong people's arduous fight in the twenty days from March 21st to April 11th, the enemy's second phase of "encirclement and suppression" plan has been smashed, and over 1,500 enemy troops have been eliminated. This includes over 1,100 enemy soldiers captured, including enemy Deputy Battalion Commander Liu Yanjun, and 420 enemy soldiers killed or wounded, including enemy Battalion Commander Zheng Peixiang. Important strongholds such as Tiewang and Qiutou have been recovered, and the enemy's Baojia system in the areas bordering Yuexian and Xinzheng has been destroyed, and democratic political power has been rebuilt. Currently, there are no enemy traces in the entire central area of Chishui. Except for areas such as Malan, Diaolingguan, Gaowangshan, Weidianzi, Liulin, Miaowan, and Xipodian, which have not yet been recovered, the vast majority of areas have been liberated. The local masses have returned home to carry out spring plowing. Major battles in the past twenty days include: the Wutingzi battle in Xinning in late March, in which five companies of the 2nd Regiment of the enemy's New 1st Brigade were annihilated; the campaign to recover Tiewang Town, in which all five companies of the 3rd Battalion of the Chiang Kai-shek's 7th Security Regiment were wiped out; and the Xiaoyuanzi battle on April 1st, in which the entire 3rd Battalion of the 248th Regiment of the enemy's American-equipped 10th Division, 83rd Brigade was annihilated. In addition, the people throughout the region have also launched a widespread movement to kill the enemy, so that small groups of enemies no longer dare to easily intrude and cause trouble. For example, one person in the 4th District of Xinning single-handedly captured a fleeing enemy soldier and seized a rifle. An old man in Chishui killed two enemies with a sickle, and the masses in Tiewang beat an enemy to death with hoes. The spoils of war in the past twenty days include one rocket launcher, two 82mm mortars, seven 60mm mortars, 53 light and heavy machine guns, 26 Sten submachine guns, 62 rifles and carbines, three anti-tank rifles, three telephones, and four pairs of binoculars.

Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 25th: A certain company of the People's Liberation Army on the Shaanxi-North frontline is still seizing the gaps in continuous warfare to conduct military training. On the 11th and 12th of this month, they conducted military training for two days in the village where they were stationed. On the first day, they conducted exercises in mountain head offense and defense, practicing sentry duty, military sentry duty, platoon attacks, and the coordination of different arms. On the second day, cadres above the company and platoon level collectively studied experience, using piles of earth to arrange a complex and crisscrossing mountain head on the ground. Cadres at all levels focused on searching, defending, and attacking the mountain head, proposing methods to complete the task and engaging in debates.
