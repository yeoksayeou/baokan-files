　　A Unit on the North Henan Front Line
    Taiwanese Soldier Earns Merit
    [This newspaper's dispatch from the North Henan Front, 15th] Taiwanese soldiers of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, responding to the Taiwanese people's uprising against the Chiang Kai-shek tyranny, fiercely annihilated the Chiang bandits and competed to earn merit in the battle of Niushitun (south of Huaxian County). When Taiwanese soldier Dai Guang was finally resolving the enemy in a building, he was the first to climb to the top floor, using two grenades to drive more than thirty enemies layer by layer down the stairs, forcing them to surrender their guns. Soldier Zhong Tongzhao meticulously searched for the enemy at the end of the battle, capturing twenty Chiang soldiers alone in a courtyard. Chen Changji, during the charge, braved the enemy's intense fire, carrying wounded comrades back and forth three times, and finally caught up with the attacking troops and plunged into the fierce battle. He was originally a petroleum worker. He said, "Taiwanese compatriots are risking their lives against Chiang Kai-shek even without guns. We, in the Eighth Route Army, must compete with our Taiwanese compatriots to end Chiang Kai-shek's rule and liberate Taiwan as soon as possible."
