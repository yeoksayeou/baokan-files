[News from our frontline reporter group] The Li Saiyi Yi-Character Unit has newly created the "Record the Good, Learn the Good Movement" and "Door-Panel Newspapers" in its political work. Since the emergence of door-panel newspapers and the launch of the "Record the Good, Learn the Good Movement," the Yi-Character Unit has made a leap forward in its political work. The Yi-Character Unit alone has 50 door-panel newspapers and over 2,000 soldier-correspondents, giving the door-panel newspapers a wide mass character. One regiment wrote 1,620 articles in half a month, praising over 2,000 people. In the Special Service Company of this regiment, 83% of the comrades wrote articles, averaging over 30 articles per day, and the 4th Company wrote over 80 articles in one day. Most door-panel newspapers are published daily, and yesterday's and today's events can be reflected immediately. They persist in publishing newspapers even during the most intense battles and continuous marches, praising heroes and various models in a timely manner. After the Battle of Laotian'an, although the soldiers had not slept for a day, the heroes appeared on the door-panel newspapers immediately after the battle, and many soldiers wrote their articles before sleeping after a night march. The soldiers used simple words, a cartoon, or a few lines of doggerel to praise comrades in their own squads, platoons, and companies. In Xu Lou Village, the people, seeing the good mass discipline of the troops, also wrote articles and posted them on the door-panel newspapers to praise the soldiers. Cadres praise soldiers, soldiers praise soldiers, soldiers praise cadres, and the people praise soldiers and cadres.

The "Record the Good, Learn the Good Movement" and door-panel newspapers are closely integrated. The "Record the Good Movement" is an extension of the merit-making movement. Soldiers and cadres find good things that everyone has done every day, record them in the "Record the Good Book," and post them on the door-panel newspapers. Since the Yi-Character Unit launched the "Record the Good Movement" and door-panel newspapers, it has transformed many backward elements. Cadres in a certain regiment have the feeling that they now understand the masses better, are closer to the masses, and their work is more productive and easier than in the past. Soldiers and soldiers, soldiers and cadres are also more united. At a cadre meeting to exchange experiences, Political Commissar Su ×× commented on the door-panel newspapers: Using such door-panel newspapers to connect with the masses and to promote the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses is not just a newspaper issue, but a new and good method of leadership.

The form of the door-panel newspapers is very simple. Wherever the army is stationed, it only needs to paste the collected and compiled manuscripts on a door panel, without paying attention to any layout. The reason why it has a great effect and strong guidance is that the content of the door-panel newspapers is mainly praise, it has a wide mass character, door-panel newspapers are everywhere, and can be posted at any time. Soldiers and cadres praise whatever they do, which can inspire the new heroism of the people's fighters.

Also: The experience of the Eighth District Team of the Yi-Character Unit in persisting with door-panel newspapers in combat:

(1) First, cadres must clear their minds and believe that they can persist in combat, recognizing that publishing door-panel newspapers in combat is a good method of mass continuous mobilization and encouragement work. (2) Cadres take the lead in personally taking action, writing themselves, and separately grasping the writing of each small unit. (3) Party members guarantee and take the lead in writing. (4) Propose competitions to each other and promptly praise those who actively write articles. (5) Write more about battlefield activities during combat. (6) In extremely dispersed situations, small notebooks can be used instead of panels to record manuscripts and try to circulate them for reading.

Also: Comrade Jiang Siyi, Director of the Political Department of the Yi-Character Unit, summarized the ten benefits of door-panel newspapers at a meeting to discuss door-panel newspapers: (1) Timely record the good and promote righteousness. (2) Raise awareness and improve culture. (3) Broadcast news and exchange experiences. (4) Self-criticism and launch ideological struggle. (5) Help leaders understand the lower levels. (6) Encourage each other and enhance unity. (7) Promote work and transform backwardness. (8) Mass evaluation, clear merits and demerits. (9) Launch competitions and create a upsurge. (10) Publicize propositions and implement policies. (Yong Jin)

　　激励人民战士的新英雄主义
    毅字部队创造门板报
    【本报前线记者团消息】李塞毅字部队政治工作上新创造“记好学好运动”与“门板报”。毅字部队自出现门板报与开展记好学好运动后，政治工作上飞跃前进。只毅字部队即有五十块门板报，二千多个战士通讯员，门板报具有广泛的群众性。一个团半月内即写稿一六二○篇，表扬了二千余人。该团特务连即有百分之八十三的同志写稿，每天平均三十余件稿子，四连一天就写了八十多篇。门板报多是每天一期，昨日的事和当天的事马上都能得到反映。他们在最紧张的战斗中和连续的行军中，一样坚持着出报，及时的表扬了英雄与各种模范。当老田庵战斗后，虽然战士们一天里没睡觉，战斗后英雄们马上在门板上出现了，许多战士夜行军到达地点都是写完了稿子再睡觉。战士们用简单的几个字、一幅漫画或几句顺口快板来表扬自己班排连的同志。在徐楼村，老百姓看着部队群众纪律好，也写稿往门板报上贴来表扬战士。干部表扬战士，战士表扬战士，战士表扬干部，老百姓表扬战士和干部。
    记好学好运动与门板报是紧相结合的。记好运动是立功运动的引伸，战士干部每天都互相找找大家做的好事情，记在记好簿上，登在门板报上。毅字部队自开展记好运动与出现门板报，改造了不少的落后分子。在某团干部都有这样的感觉：现在他们更加了解群众，更加接近群众了，工作比过去作的又多还又轻松。战士与战士，战士与干部也都团结得更好了。在一个交流经验的干部会上，苏××政委对门板报的评价是：用这样的门板报来联系群众，来发扬群众的积极性和创造性，这不只是一个报纸的问题，而且是一个新的好的领导方法。
    门板报的形式很简单，军队住到那里，只须把收集起来编好的稿子贴在一块门板上就成了，不讲求什么编排形式。其所以效果大，指导性强，是因为门板报的内容是表扬为主，有广泛的群众性，门板报到处有，随时可以贴。战士干部干啥表扬啥，能激励人民战士的新英雄主义。
    又：毅字部八区队在战斗中坚持门板报的经验：
    （一）首先要干部打通思想，认为在作战当中能够坚持，认识到作战当中出版门板报是群众性的连续动员鼓动工作的一种好方法。（二）干部带头亲自下手，干部带头写，分头掌握各小单位写。（三）党内保证、党员带头写。（四）互相提出比赛，及时表扬写稿积极的人。（五）战斗时要多写战场活动。（六）在极其分散的情况下，可不用板把写稿子订成小本子设法传读。
    又：毅字部队政治部主任姜思毅同志在座谈门板报的会议上总结门板报的十大好处：（一）及时记好，发扬正气。（二）提高觉悟，提高文化。（三）广播消息，交流经验。（四）自我批评，开展思想斗争。（五）帮助领导了解下层。（六）互相勉励，增强团结。（七）推动工作，改造落后。（八）群众评议，功过分明。（九）发动竞赛，造成热潮。（十）宣传主张实现政策。（勇进）
