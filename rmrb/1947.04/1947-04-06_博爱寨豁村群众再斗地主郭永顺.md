　　【Bo'ai News from this newspaper】Guo Yongshun, a local tyrant landlord in Zhaihuo Village, Bo'ai, had his old accounts exposed in the surrounding villages. In Tanhua Village, out of 19 households, 50 households exposed his accounts. During famine years, he forced debts and drove seven or eight families to their deaths, seizing their land. He also relied on his son being a section member in the puppet district office and his nephew being in the Thirteenth Detachment, so he didn't pay corvee or grain taxes. After a struggle during the mass movement last year, he deliberately pretended to be poor, telling everyone he was helpless. This time, when the idea of "leveling and making up" was proposed, some cadres and masses felt there was nothing to struggle for. Some said, "His brain has changed, look, he even lets us eat!" Some said, "He doesn't have anything left, offending him one more time won't get anything out." Others said, "His nephew is still in the stubborn army, we don't dare to struggle against him." Based on the above ideas of "almost done" and "nothing left," after holding discussions in the Farmers' Association, mass meetings, old folks meetings, and various system meetings, their thinking was straightened out. A three-day large-scale struggle meeting with more than 300 people was launched, and it was a victory. They struggled out 348 silver dollars, 14 *shi* of wheat, 858 strings of copper coins, 95 pieces of clothing, 10 *zhang* of cloth, 190 *jin* of cotton (all buried underground), 14 *shi* of miscellaneous grains, 171 pieces of furniture, and 95 pieces of farm implements. Seeing so much stuff, the masses became more awakened and recognized the landlord's devilish face. They all said, "We must struggle thoroughly in the future and never be deceived by the landlord's pretense."

　　博爱寨豁村群众再斗地主郭永顺
    【本报博爱讯】寨豁村恶霸地主郭永顺，周围村子都揭过旧账，探花庄，村里十九户即有五十户揭过他的账。灾荒年时讨账逼死七八家，并将土地霸走，又仗他儿在伪区署当区员，他侄儿在十三支队，不支差；不出粮款。经去年群运斗争一次，以后就故意装穷，见人即说没办法。这次提出“填平补齐”，有些干部及群众都感到没斗头，有的说：“他脑筋转了，你看他还让咱吃饭！”有的说：他已经没啥东西了，多得罪他一次也斗不出东西来。还有说：他侄儿还在顽军里，不敢斗。根据以上“差不多”，“没啥了”等思想，召开了农会、群众会、老伴人会以及各系统会讨论后，打通了思想。展开了三百余人的三天大斗争会，结果胜利了，斗出银元三百四十八元、麦子十四石、铜元八百五十八串、衣服九十五件、布十丈、棉花一百九十斤（都在地下埋藏着）、杂粮十四石、家具一百七十一件，农具九十五件。一看到这样多的东西，群众更觉悟了，认清地主的鬼脸。都说：以后定要斗透，绝不被地主装蒜而迷惑。
