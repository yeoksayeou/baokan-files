　　United Cadres and Masses of the Eleventh District of Wu'an
    Re-examination Results Exceed Previous Two Months

    [Report from this newspaper in Wu'an] Following the conscription movement in Wu'an's Eleventh District last month, the district used a large-scale training approach, mobilizing honest peasants, adjusting cadre-mass relations, and launching a peasant self-conscious unity movement, re-engaging deeply in checking feudal remnants. In just ten days, statistics from sixteen villages alone revealed more than 6,000 mu of landlord land, 1,200 rooms, 100,000 catties of grain, 6.5 million yuan in funds, and many farming tools and clothing, exceeding the results of the movement in the two months after the New Year by one-fold. After the conscription movement, cadres and the masses experienced fatigue and wanted to rest, advocating a quick distribution of the fruits and a shift to production. In order to implement land reform, the leadership immediately convened training classes for cadres, new and old activists, and honest peasants (training over 2,000 people in ten days). During the training, the honest peasants initially had concerns, fearing to make incorrect proposals, fearing their proposals would be ineffective, and even more fearing retaliation from cadres, adopting a "better to say less than to say more" attitude and refusing to speak. The leadership immediately supported them, guiding them to "compare time" and "compare life," comparing themselves with neighbors, friends, cadres, and relatives. When they compared themselves to others who were also poor in the past but had now turned over while they were still poor, their emotions became agitated. Then they "compared speech," naturally delving into "comparing thought" from why others dared to speak while they did not. This revealed many muddled thoughts such as conscience, destiny, and "becoming big." Immediately following this was "comparing suffering," gradually arousing consciousness. During discussions, honest peasants requested that new and old turned-over households report their ideological processes before and after turning over. At this point, a clear contrast formed between progressive and backward thinking. Honest peasants recognized that backward thinking was all used by landlords to rule peasants, and that "wanting land" and "wanting to turn over" were their true thoughts and demands. Their awareness greatly increased, and they dug up the landlord's "air raid shelters" and made suggestions to the cadres. Zhang Congde, a military dependent from Jingwan, burst into tears when she remembered that her husband and two children had all joined the Eighth Route Army while she was still threatened and deceived by the landlord as an "air raid shelter," regretting that she had let down her husband and sons. She immediately returned home, brought the stolen goods to the meeting, and demanded that everyone overthrow the landlord. Peasants from Zebujun pointed out that the political director was protecting several landlords who had not been struggled against because he had married the landlord's daughter. Many problems, such as the failure to eliminate feudalism and cadres obtaining more fruits, were raised in other villages as well. At this time, the leadership immediately called on the cadres to "wash their faces" and "perform meritorious service," and called on the honest peasants to "remove heart disease" and unite with the cadres to completely overthrow the landlords. After the training, cadres from various villages returned to their villages to "wash their faces and wipe off the black marks" before the masses, returning the over-obtained fruits (a total of 79 mu of over-obtained land, 58 rooms, and grain and clothing were returned); the masses also automatically made self-criticisms to the cadres, criticizing and commending the cadres, forming a great unity movement where cadres and masses looked at each other in the mirror and educated each other. Through this movement, cadre-mass relations have been greatly improved. Therefore, significant achievements in re-examination have been made in just ten days. (Lu Lin)

　　武安十一区干群大团结
    复查成绩超过前两月
    【本报武安讯】武安十一区于上月中参军运动结束后，用大训练方式，发动老实农民，调整干群关系，开展了农民自觉团结运动，重新深入查封建割尾巴，十天来获得相当大的成绩。仅十六村统计，即查出地主土地六千多亩，房一千二百多间，粮食十万斤，款六百五十万元，及许多农具衣物，超过年后两月运动果实一倍。参军运动后，干部群众曾发生疲惫情绪，都想歇一歇，主张迅速分了果实转入生产。领导上为贯彻土地改革，即召开干部、新老积极分子和老实农民训练班（十天内共训两千余人），训练中，开始老实农民有顾虑，怕提不对，怕提出不顶事，更怕干部报复，抱着多一言不如少一语的态度，不肯说话，领导上当即给他们撑腰，引导“比时光”“比生活”，和邻居、相好、干部和亲戚比，当他们比到过去同样是穷人，现在人家已翻了身自己还是穷人的时候，情绪就激动起来。接着就“比说话”，从为啥别人敢说话自己不敢说话自然地深入到“比思想”，这样就发现出良心、命运、变大等许多糊涂思想。紧接着就进入“比痛苦”，逐渐引起自觉。讨论中老实农民要求新老翻身户报告自己翻身前后的思想过程，至此，进步、落后两种思想形成鲜明对比。老实农民认识了落后思想都是地主用来统治农民的，而“要土地”、“要翻身”才是自己的真实思想和要求后，觉悟大为提高，纷纷挖掉地主“防空洞”，并对干部提出意见。井湾抗属张从的，想起男人和两个孩子都当了八路军自己还受地主威胁欺骗当“防空洞”时，就大哭起来，悔恨自己对不起丈夫和儿子，立即回家把赃物拿到大会上，要求大家将该地主斗垮。泽布峻农民提出政治主任因娶了地主闺女就包庇着几个地主没斗。其他村子也都提出了封建未消灭和干部多得果实等许多问题。此时领导上即号召干部“洗脸”、“立功”，并号召老实农民“去心病”和干部团结彻底斗垮地主。训练结束后，各村干部即回村向群众洗脸擦黑，退出多得果实（计共自退多得土地七十九亩，房五十八间及粮食衣物等）；群众亦自动向干部作自我检讨，对干部进行批评和表功，形成干群互相照镜子互相教育的大团结运动。经过这一运动，干群关系已大为改善。故在短短十天中取得复查的重大成绩。（鲁林）
