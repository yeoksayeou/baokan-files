　　Heavy Business Taxes in Chiang's Area
    Desolate Cities in Suiyuan
    [Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 8th] According to Suiyuan's Kuomintang newspapers, towns in Suiyuan under Fu Zuoyi's rule are increasingly desolate. The streets of Gui Sui are deserted, and many shops take the opportunity to close down for the New Year. Although the authorities force them to open, only a very few manage to keep up appearances, making the situation even more bleak than during the enemy and puppet regime. Sarachi, the commercial center of western Suiyuan, second only to Gui Sui and Baotou, now has only a few dozen shops left, each burdened with business taxes of 120 million yuan per month. The city of Qingshuihe has only a few small shops remaining, which were also levied 16 million yuan in business taxes last year. Merchants are unable to bear the burden and are not allowed to close down freely, causing them to complain endlessly. The Gui Sui Meat Industry Association has already issued a telegram requesting a reduction in business taxes.

　　蒋区营业税重
    绥远城市荒凉
    【新华社晋绥八日电】据绥远国民党报纸透露，傅作义统治下之绥远各城镇日趋萧条，归绥街道冷落，商号多趁年关歇业，当局虽强迫开市，但强支门面者仍极寥寥，较敌伪统治时期尤为凄凉。仅次于归绥、包头两地之绥西商业中心萨拉齐，现仅存商店数十家，每月负担营业税一项即达一亿二千万元。清水河城则仅余小店数家，去年亦派营业税一千六百万元。商人无力负担，又无歇业自由，莫不叫苦连天。日前归绥肉业公会已发出代电，要求减轻营业税款。
