    Doctor Goes to the Countryside to Eradicate Plague
    Treating Patients While Selling Medicine
    Zhang Shunmin Medical Cooperative Supported by All
    [This newspaper, Taiyue, 21st dispatch] The Yicheng Zhang Shunmin Medical Cooperative adopted the method of doctors going to the countryside to treat patients while selling medicine, which is quite popular among the masses. The cooperative's development has the following characteristics: (1) It is not extravagant and does not emphasize formality (in fact, it is a mass form). Wherever there are patients, the doctor carries medicine on their back to see patients and sell medicine, and calls on the masses to buy shares. (2) The Fourth Branch in Fujia Village was established because there was an epidemic in the local area. The doctor carried medicine on their back to eradicate the epidemic, and the masses would not let them leave, so they raised shares and opened the Fourth Branch. (3) The relationship between branches is such that they understand each other's situations (medicine prices, illnesses), contact each other, invest in each other, compete with each other, and are responsible for each other. (4) In terms of buying medicine: the principle is to buy from afar rather than nearby, to buy cheap rather than expensive, to buy in bulk rather than retail, and to collect funds uniformly for purchase, and then sell at the original price upon return. (5) The interest rate does not exceed 30% at most, 25% for military dependents and revolutionary martyrs' families. In addition, there is a public welfare fund, and the poor masses can use the public welfare fund to pay for medicine, so the masses are very satisfied. At the medical and health meeting held in early April, it was unanimously praised by everyone, and everyone was called on to learn from it.

    医生下乡扑灭瘟疫
    一边治病一边卖药
    张顺敏医药社人人拥护
    【本报太岳二十一日电】翼城张顺敏医药合作社采取医生下乡一面治病一边卖药办法，颇得群众拥护，该社发展上有以下特点：（一）不铺张，不讲形式，（实际上是群众形式）那里有病人，就让医生背上药，一面看病，一面卖药，并号召群众入股。（二）富家庄的四分社，是因当地有时疫，医生背上药扑灭了时疫，群众便不让走，集起股来，开办了四分社。（三）分社与分社关系，彼此了解情况（药价病情），互相联络，互相入股，互相竞赛，互相负责。（四）买药方面：原则是远买近不买，贱买贵不买，整买零不买，统一集资购买，回来按原价出售。（五）利率最高不超过百分之三十，军干烈属百分之二十五，另外有公益金，贫苦群众买药可由公益金支出，因之群众非常满意。四月初召开之医药卫生会上，得到大家一致称赞，并号召大家向他学习。
