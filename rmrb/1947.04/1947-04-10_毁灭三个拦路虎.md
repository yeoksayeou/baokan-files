　　Destroying Three Obstacles
    Artillery Company Commander Liu Ronghou
    On New Year's Eve at dawn, we received the mission: to destroy the碉堡 (diāobǎo - bunker/blockhouse) outside the West Gate of Ju-ye. The comrades immediately busied themselves with fortifications, pushing the cannons, aiming, and firing. Boom! A cloud of black smoke rose from the碉堡 (diāobǎo), which turned into a dead pig, silent as death.
    An hour later, the machine gun on the碉堡 (diāobǎo) started wailing again, as if it hadn't had enough shells. We weren't stingy, and generously gave it six more, all of which hit. Half of the碉堡 (diāobǎo) collapsed and caught fire. Three enemies desperately ran out and became prisoners, while the remaining two squads and their deputy company commander were cremated.
    In the afternoon, the mountain guns had to enter the West Gate to coordinate the city's capture, but at that time, there was an obstacle (碉堡 diāobǎo) on both the left and right sides, frantically blocking the advance, as if they also wanted to taste the shells. We immediately responded to their request, giving the one on the left four shells first, hitting three; then giving the one on the right two shells, all of which hit. Their desires were satisfied, and the 碉堡 (diāobǎo) became the enemy's tomb. We smoothly entered the West Gate to complete our second mission.

　　毁灭三个拦路虎
    炮兵连长  刘荣厚
    除夕拂晓，接受任务：摧毁巨野西关外的碉堡。同志们马上紧张的做工事，推炮，瞄准，射击。轰！碉堡上起了一团黑烟，碉堡变成死猪，一声不响了。
    一点钟后，碉堡上的机枪又哭叫起来，好像炮弹没有吃够。我们不小气，很大方的，又给它吃了六发，全部命中。碉堡垮了一半，着起火来。三个敌人没命的跑出来做了俘虏，其余的两个班，和他们的副连长都火葬了。
    下午，山炮要进西关，配合攻城，可是当时左右各有一个拦路虎（碉堡），疯狂的封锁着前进道路，好像是也想尝尝炮弹的滋味，我们马上答复它的要求，先给左边的四发，命中三发；再给右边的两发，全命中。满足了他们的欲望，于是碉堡变为敌人的坟墓。我们顺利的进入西关，去完成第二个任务。
