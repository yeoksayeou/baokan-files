　　Chiang Kai-shek's Troops Frantically Seize Recruits
　　Everywhere is the Sound of Crying
　　[This Newspaper Reports] The Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Front troops have captured multiple secret orders related to Chiang Kai-shek's troops "recruiting soldiers," including an order, Jun Zi No. 209, from the "Zhecheng County Government of Henan Province." The order instructed all townships within the county to decide the order of recruitment by drawing lots, assigning numbers to all able-bodied men, and urgently conscripting the quota of recruits for that period. The total number of able-bodied men numbered throughout the county was 22,398, with an initial quota of 1,185 and a reserve of 2,370. This kind of drafting was doubled each period and increased monthly until not a single man was left. This drafting even included all middle school and even university students; for example, Zhao Kelian from the first Bao of Niudou Township in the county, a student at Northwest Normal College in Lanzhou, Gansu, was not spared. Another document showed that Chiang Kai-shek's troops abused the drafted soldiers in every way. A telegram, Yu Yi Ke Er Zi No. 3167, from the Chiang Kai-shek National Defense Ministry in the thirty-fifth year, stated: "Zhang Qicang, a major and recruiting director of the 83rd Division stationed in Qinghe Garden, Pukou, received 150 recruits from Qingjiang County on October 14th of this year. He used ropes to tie them together in groups of five, beat them severely for the slightest movement, and wrote the word 'soldier' in large red characters on the back of each recruit's clothing..."
　　[Comprehensive Xinhua News Agency Dispatch] Chiang Kai-shek's troops are frantically seizing recruits in Qingdao, Xuzhou, and other places. The Chiang Kai-shek authorities in Qingdao have explicitly stipulated that drafting will begin on the first of this month, with fifty men from each Bao in the first period, totaling approximately five thousand men throughout the city. They are also forcibly concentrating able-bodied men aged sixteen to forty to form "Police Defense Brigades" to supplement troop numbers, with over seven hundred people already forced to concentrate. The Chiang Kai-shek troops in Xuzhou have established "Youth Reception Centers" as concentration camps for young people of "unclear origin," and as soon as they reach a company's worth of people, they are transported to Hangzhou for training. Of the 800 new recruits recently transferred from Xuzhou to Lincheng to supplement the 84th Division, 500 deserted within eight days en route.
　　In the Chiang Kai-shek controlled areas of Chongming and Haimen counties north of the Yangtze River, Chiang Kai-shek's troops have frantically seized over 1,800 recruits. In Qinglong Port, Haimen, all men aged between eighteen and forty-five are being seized. The Chiang Kai-shek troops in Qidong are even more brazenly capturing wealthy peasants as a way to extort money. In one township alone, as many as eighty wealthy peasants have been captured.
　　In Lusi Port, a major seaport in eastern Nantong, central Jiangsu, Chiang Kai-shek's troops blockaded the streets on March 10th, seizing eighty-eight recruits. They threatened them with machine guns and forced them onto ships to be transported away. Instantly, the whole town was filled with wails and cries. A man named Li, who sold flatbreads, clung to his son, crying and refusing to let go, but was brutally beaten by Chiang Kai-shek's soldiers. Now, Chiang Kai-shek's troops are forcing young people in the town to organize "self-defense teams," drilling every day, in preparation for being the second batch of recruits. In the two months that Chiang Kai-shek's troops have occupied the town, they have extorted 7 million Chiang Kai-shek dollars in "National Army hospitality fees," 70 million in gun donations, and dozens of other fees such as "reserve funds," "self-defense team fees," and "district office operating expenses." Merchants and residents have been extorted to the point where they cannot continue to operate, and the port has become a dead port. Some families in the suburbs of Lusi have also suffered the misfortune of having their homes destroyed. A man nicknamed "Dog Filth," who works in Shanghai, had his home targeted after his family was unable to pay the exorbitant tax of 150,000 Chiang Kai-shek dollars. On March 15th, Chiang Kai-shek's troops went to his home to arrest people. His wife escaped, and Chiang Kai-shek's troops set fire to two thatched houses, burning his three sons, aged two, six, and eight, alive. When she returned home, she saw only ashes. The skulls of her three children were cracked open. She cried and fainted, and now she is insane, calling out for her children all day long.

　　蒋军疯狂抓丁
    到处都是哭声
    【本报讯】晋冀鲁豫前线部队缴获有关蒋军“征兵”密令多起，内有“河南省柘城县政府”调令军字第二○九号代电一件，令饬该县各乡镇所有壮丁，经抽签决定先后编号按期配征，敦促火速将该期壮丁征齐。计全县所有编号壮丁为二二三九八名，该期配额为一一八五名，准备递补为二三七○名。这样期期加倍，月月增加，直至抽到一个不留。此种抽丁且包括所有中学生乃至大学生，如该县牛斗乡第一保赵克廉，系甘肃兰州西北师范学院学生，亦难幸免。另一文件显示蒋军对抽来壮丁，百般虐待。蒋记国防部三十五年鱼戍役科二字第三一六七号代电内供称：“驻浦口庆和园八十三师少校接兵主任张其仓于本年十月十四日接收清江县壮丁一百五十名，用绳索以五人相连捆缚，一移动即遭毒打，并以红墨水在每一壮丁背上衣服大书‘兵’字。……”
    【综合新华社电讯】蒋军在青岛、徐州等地又疯狂抓丁。青岛蒋当局已明令规定于本月一日开始抽丁，第一期每保五十名，全市共约五千余名，并强迫集中十六岁至四十岁壮丁，成立“警防大队”补充兵额，现已有七百余人被迫集中。徐州蒋军则成立“青年招待所”，作为“来路不明”的青年的集中营，每满一个连人数，即运往杭州训练。新近从徐州调至临城补充八十四师之新兵团八百人，途中八天内即逃跑五百余名。
    长江北岸崇明海门等县蒋军在其据点内疯狂抓丁已达一千八百余人。海门青龙港凡年龄在十八至四十五岁者，一律抓去。启东蒋军更大肆捕捉富农，借此敲诈。一个乡富农被抓者即达八十余名。
    苏中重要海港之一的南通东部吕四港蒋军曾于三月十日封锁街头，抓丁八十八名，以机枪威胁押上船运走。顿时哭声震动全镇，做大饼生意的李某拉住儿子痛哭不放，反被蒋军毒打一顿。现蒋军又强迫市镇青年组织“自卫队”，天天出操，准备作第二批壮丁。蒋军侵占该镇二个月中，即捐了“国军招待费”蒋币七百万元，枪捐七千万元，其他“预备费”、“自卫团费”、“区公所办公费”等几十种，商民被勒索得无法继续营业，该港已成死港。吕四近郊有些人家亦惨遭毁家之祸。有一个绰号“狗瘪子”的，本人在上海做工，其家无法缴纳十五万蒋币的苛捐，三月十五日蒋军到他家抓人，其妻逃避，蒋军纵火将二间草房焚毁，留在家里的二、六、八岁三个男孩全活活烧死。当她回家时见一片灰烬，三个孩子烧得头盖骨裂开，她哭昏倒地，整天疯癫地呼喊着孩子。
