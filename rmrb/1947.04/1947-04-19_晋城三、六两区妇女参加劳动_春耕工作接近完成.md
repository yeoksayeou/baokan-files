(This report from Taiyue, 17th of this month) In Jincheng's Third and Sixth Districts, while men support the front lines, a large number of women have been absorbed into agricultural labor, and spring plowing is nearing completion. After the young and middle-aged men in the Third and Sixth Districts went to support the front lines, the Women's Salvation Association immediately called on women's weaving groups to turn to agriculture and carry out plowing and dam construction. At first, many people felt that women were useless. Li Ruanruan, the head of the Xinbi mutual aid group, was unwilling to let women dig the land, and textile group leader Li Ruanruan was very unconvinced and proposed a competition with men. As a result, the plowing speed exceeded that of the men. Fifty-five women in Pingtou Village plowed 15 mu of land every day, and they plowed deeper than men, becoming a recognized model group in the village. All six hundred and twenty-three women in Xinbi Village participated in labor, digging six hundred and sixty-seven and a half mu in four days. With the active participation of women, the two districts have now finished plowing. In six villages, including Pingtou, the men went to support the front lines, and the women of Yao Tianzhong cultivated all 1,400 mu of land. The primary task in mobilizing women to participate in agricultural labor is ideological education, improving political awareness, and breaking the old ideas of "being shy about working the land" and "women can only spin, weave, and cook." Ke Rongrong, the chairman of the Xinbi Village Women's Salvation Association, educated the women members: "Everything is for the front lines. The men have gone to the front lines to defend our liberation, so we must cultivate the land well in the rear so that the people in the front can rest assured!" When resting in the fields, the Xu Cuilan mutual aid group in Nancun discussed current affairs. This made everyone realize that fighting Chiang Kai-shek is everyone's business. We cannot go to the front lines, but cultivating the land well in the rear is the same. If the front and rear work together, we can defeat Chiang Kai-shek! Therefore, the enthusiasm of women in agricultural production has been maintained. Secondly, it is necessary to cultivate strong women cadres to lead. Zhang Gaihuan, the chairman of the Ancun Women's Salvation Association, personally led women to make production plans, record work points, and then took the lead in going to the fields, encouraging the women's production enthusiasm. In addition to being able to make careful plans and take the lead in labor, Zhang Gaihuan can also understand the weaknesses and vanity of women. In labor, she only praises and does not criticize. One day, the women returned from the fields. When they passed through the street, the men were eating. Seeing the women coming, they all shouted, "The women are really capable, the ground they plow is level with just a footstep!" Zhang Gaihuan sternly warned them, "If the women don't do well, the men only have the obligation to guide them, not the right to criticize!" In the Hecun village, women and men formed a joint mutual aid group for field labor. The captain, instructor, and group leaders all adopted methods of praise and encouragement, so that the women's production enthusiasm has remained high.

　　晋城三、六两区妇女参加劳动
    春耕工作接近完成
    【本报太岳十七日电】晋城三、六区在男人支援前线中吸收广大妇女参加农业劳动，春耕已接近完成。三、六区在青壮年去支援前线以后，妇救会即号召妇女纺织组转向农业，进行犁地、垒堰。开始时，许多人觉得妇女不中用。辛壁互助组里不要妇女刨地，纺织组长李软软很不服气，提出和男人比赛，结果犁地速度超过男人。坪头村五十五个妇女每天强犁十五亩地，且较男人犁的更深，成为全村公认的模范组。辛壁村六百廿三个妇女，全部参加劳动，四天刨地六百六十七亩半。在妇女积极参加下，该两区日前已犁完地。坪头等六村男人支援前线去了，妇女尧天中将一千四百亩地全部耕完。动员妇女参加农业劳动，首要的是思想教育，提高政治觉悟，打破“上地害羞”和“妇女们只能纺花织布做饭”的旧思想。辛壁村妇救主席克荣荣教育妇女会员说：“一切为了前线。男人为保卫咱们的翻身，援助前线去了，咱们在后方作务好地，前方的人才安心呀！”南村徐翠兰互助组，在地里休息时讨论时事。使大家认识了打蒋介石是大家的事，咱们不能到前线，在后方把地种好也一样。前后方一齐干，才能打败蒋介石！所以保持了妇女参加农业生产的热情。其次必须培养坚强的妇女干部来领导。岸村妇救主席张改换一手领导妇女作生产计划、记工，接着就带头上地，鼓舞了妇女的生产情绪。张改换除能周密计划与带头劳动外，并能体会妇女们的软弱性与虚荣心，在劳动中只表扬、不批评。某日，妇女们从地里生产回来，路经街上，男人们正在吃饭，看见妇女过来，皆大叫说：“妇女们真能干，犁的地脚板一踏就平了！”张改换很严厉的警告他们说：“妇女们做的不好，男人们只有指导的义务，没有批评的权利！”河村妇女与男人合组互助组，上地劳动，队长指导员小组长等皆采取表扬鼓励办法，使妇女生产情绪一直很高。
