Jinan-North Henan Frontline Troops
　　Strictly Enforce Discipline and Commit No Offenses
　　All Captured Materials Are Turned Over to the Public

[Our Newspaper, Taiyue Front, 20th Dispatch] During the Jinan Campaign, a certain unit thoroughly carried out the "Four Goods" movement, especially in mass discipline and prisoner-of-war policies, which were done even better. Before the battle, the unit put forward the slogan of "One No Entry" and "Three No Takes." "One No Entry" means not entering civilian houses without reason. "Three No Takes" means not taking a single needle or thread from the masses, not taking anything from prisoners, and not taking public property. After the Second Battalion captured Xinjiang, the soldiers sat neatly in rows on the streets, and no one entered the houses of civilians. Shops and residents called them benevolent and righteous troops. In peacetime, they thoroughly implemented the "Three No Leavings": Whenever they arrived at a place, they cleaned the yard. The borrowed bowls and chopsticks were counted clearly at the time of borrowing, and they were washed and returned before departure. The Twelfth Company of the First Battalion, during the Mengcheng battle, departed when the horn sounded, but they still returned the bowls and chopsticks before leaving. When crossing the Fen River, the soldiers' clothes and pants were soaked, but no one took the grass from the people to burn for warmth. When helping the villagers carry water at Yumengkou, soldiers Pang Fengyi and Li Guiming of the Third Platoon of the Eighth Company were injured by artillery shells fired from across the river. Immediately, several soldiers took over the buckets and continued to carry water. The villagers were very moved and did not allow the troops to go again, and they found stretchers for the injured and helped transport them. Regarding prisoner-of-war policies, the Twelfth Company of the First Battalion captured a dozen members of the puppet government in the battle of Xinjiang. Each of them had fountain pens and watches, but nothing was touched. When a platoon leader of the Ninth Company searched a prisoner for weapons, he found a gold ring and immediately returned it. During the Mengcheng battle, soldier Wang Yushan of the Seventh Squad of the Ninth Company saw a wounded enemy, so he carried him five miles to the bandage station to exchange for medicine, and explained our army's lenient policy to the prisoner. The prisoner was very moved and determined to join the Eighth Route Army after he recovered from his injuries.

[Our Newspaper, Taiyue, 20th Dispatch] Liu Battalion of × Regiment, the main attacking force in the Houma victory, responded to the call of "Materials Belong to the Public." From Ye Ba, the battle hero who was the first to climb the city wall, to Zhang Jingqin, the cook who was the last to enter the city, not a single person in the entire battalion privately obtained a belt or a thread from the enemy. The personnel designated to collect assets handed over all the large and small spoils of victory to the superiors, one by one, and even the packages and bags were untouched. The watches, pens, kettles, and other items found by the soldiers were also handed over to the superiors. After the battle, cook Zhang Jingqin dug up 9 million yuan in Chiang Kai-shek currency and 40 cartons of cigarettes in the Kuomintang Youth League hospital, and handed them all over to the battalion headquarters, immediately turning around to cook. The soldiers' sincere dedication to public service moved the cadres, and the cadres controlled the soldiers, ensuring that no one in the entire battalion violated discipline. As Battalion Commander Liu Cunhou said: "We have no other thought except to eliminate the enemy to defend Chairman Mao. We will wholeheartedly complete the task." After the battle, no one was unhappy because they did not receive any spoils. On the contrary, everyone regarded decisively annihilating the enemy and remaining pure as a noble honor and pleasure.

[Our Newspaper, North Henan Front, 18th Dispatch] During the North Henan Campaign, the 106th Unit of the People's Liberation Army strictly observed mass discipline and battlefield discipline, winning high praise from the masses. All commanders and fighters of the unit conducted a solemn oath-taking ceremony to abide by discipline before the battle, and signed and sealed the jointly agreed oath, deciding: (1) No entering the city without orders. (2) Prohibit soldiers from acting privately. (3) Protect industry, commerce, schools, churches, and post offices. (4) Do not enter civilian houses, and protect the interests of the masses. This conscious oath-taking movement has been widely launched in the unit. Every comrade in the unit said in unison: "I have taken an oath myself, and I have also signed and sealed it. If I violate discipline again, I will really have no face to see anyone." The Fourth Company of a certain regiment conducted discipline education in the classroom. Gao Jinxiang, a newly liberated soldier, said: "We are fighting for the people. If we violate discipline again, it would be better not to fight." This mass "discipline observance" movement has improved the political understanding of every soldier. The × Company organized a discipline inspection team to promptly discover and resolve problems. Therefore, in more than 20 days of marching, no one violated mass discipline. During the Pangcun battle, the unit thoroughly implemented the "Three No Takes." No one took spoils before the battle ended, and no one took personal belongings. After the battle, they rested collectively and did not run around randomly. The people of Pangcun were so moved that they said: "This troop is really good, we haven't lost a single thing."

    晋南豫北前线部队
    军纪严明秋毫无犯
    缴获物资全部归公
    【本报太岳前线二十日电】晋南战役中，某部深入展开了“四好”运动。特别在群众纪律与俘虏政策方面，做得更好。该部队在战斗开始前，即提出“一不进”、“三不拿”的口号。一不进即无故不进民房。三不拿即不拿群众一针一线，不拿俘虏一点东西，不拿公共资财。二营在攻克新绛后，战士们都整齐的排坐在街头，没有一个人进民房。商店、居民均称之为仁义之师。平时更彻底执行“三不走”；每到一地就打扫院子，借来的碗筷都当时点清数目，出发时洗净送还。一营十二连，蒙城战斗时，出发的号响了，仍把碗筷送还了才走。在渡汾河时，战士衣裤尽湿，但没人去拿老百姓的草烧火取暖。在禹门口帮助老乡担水时，八连三排战士庞封义、李贵明被隔河打来的炮弹所伤，马上又有几个战士接起担子再担，老百姓非常感动，不让军队再去，并为受伤者找好担架，帮助运送。在俘虏政策上，一营十二连在新绛战斗中活捉十几个伪政府人员，每人身上都有水笔、手表，但一点也没动。九连一排长在俘虏身上检查武器时搜出一个金戒指，当时就归还了。蒙城战斗时，九连七班战士王玉山见到敌人一个彩号，他就把他背到绷带所去换药，一直背了五里地，并给俘虏解释我军的宽大政策。俘虏很感动，下决心伤好后要参加八路军。
    【本报太岳二十日电】侯马大捷中的主攻部队×团刘营响应“物资归公”号召，从第一名登城的战斗英雄叶巴起，直到最后进城的炊事员张景钦止，全营无一人私得敌人的一条皮带或一条线。被指定搜集资财的人员，将各宗大小胜利品，一一点交上级，连包裹、皮包等也原封未动。战士检到的手表、钢笔、水壶等，亦均呈交上级。战斗后，炊事员张景钦在三青团住院内挖出九百万元蒋币和四十条纸烟，完全交给营部，转身即去做饭。战士的诚恳为公精神感动了干部，干部又掌握了战士，作到全营无一违犯纪律。正如营长刘存厚所说：“我们除了为保卫毛主席而消灭敌人的思想以外，没有第二个思想。全心全意去完成任务。”战斗结束后，没有一个人因未得到战利品而不高兴；相反，人人都以干脆歼敌、两袖清风为高尚的光荣和愉快。
    【本报豫北前线十八日电】豫北战役中解放军一○六部，严格遵守群众纪律与战场纪律，深得群众赞扬。该部全体指战员在战斗前进行了遵守纪律的隆重宣誓。并在共同议订的誓言上签字盖章。决定（一）没有命令不进城。（二）禁止军人私自行动。（三）保护工商业、学校、教堂和邮局。（四）不进民房，爱护群众利益。这种自觉的宣誓运动，已在该部普遍展开。该部每个同志，均异口同声的说：“我自己宣誓了，也签字盖章了，如果再犯了纪律，真没有脸见人。”某团四连在课堂上进行纪律教育。新解放的战士高金祥说：“我们为老百姓打仗，如果再犯纪律，就不如不打”。这种群众性的“守纪”运动，提高了每个战士的政治认识。×连组织了纪律检查组，及时发现与解放问题。因此在二十余天的行军中，没有一个违犯群众纪律的。在庞村战斗中，该部彻底作到“三不拿”，战斗未结束以前没有人拿胜利品，没有人拿私人的东西；战斗结束后集体休息，不乱跑乱窜。感动得庞村的老百姓说：“这队伍真好，俺们没少一件东西”。
