Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 8th. Yin Yufen, a platoon leader of a certain unit of the Northwest People's Liberation Army who won a special-class medal and a special-class combat hero, is the hero who captured Li Jiyun, commander of the 31st Brigade of the Hu Army, in the Qinghuabian battle. When the Qinghuabian battle forced the enemy into the river, Platoon Leader Yin led the Seventh Squad to search forward at the front. At a place 20 meters away from them, they discovered fifty or sixty enemies. The enemy opened fire on them. Platoon Leader Yin shot down the enemy who fired with a casual shot, raised a grenade, and shouted, "Friends, lay down your weapons! Surrender and you won't be killed! We will give you preferential treatment!" The enemy wavered. Among the enemy group, there was a tall man wearing riding breeches who looked like an officer, not saying a word, and many enemies were looking at him. At this time, the enemy laid down twenty-six rifles and a heavy machine gun. Platoon Leader Yin quickly went up to move the guns over and handed them to Comrade Jiao Wanshan of the squad, and then rushed out with the other six members of the Seventh Squad and captured fifty-nine prisoners. The tall man in riding breeches was also captured by them. During the interrogation of the prisoners, it was discovered that he was Li Jiyun, commander of the 31st Brigade of the Hu Army.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 8th. After Li Jiyun, commander of the 31st Brigade of the Hu Army, was captured in Qinghuabian, northeast of Yan'an, our front-line reporter met and talked with him, asking about his feelings about the civil war. Li said, "My mind is confused, I don't know what to say." But when his soldiers were interviewed, they talked endlessly. Yang Xilian, a second-class soldier of the unit who had been liberated, replied with a smile, "Who wants to fight a civil war? We were forced to fight. Our platoon leader was shot because he fled the civil war."

　　战斗英雄尹玉芬活捉李纪云经过
    【新华社陕北八日电】曾获特等奖章之西北人民解放军某部特等战斗英雄尹玉芬排长，即此次清化砭战斗中活捉胡军三十一旅旅长李纪云的英雄。当清化砭战斗把敌人压到河川里去了的时候，尹排长带着第七班在前头搜索前进，在一处距他们二十米的地方发现了五六十个敌人。敌人向他们开枪，尹排长顺手一枪就将放枪的敌人打倒了，高举着手榴弹喊：“朋友们缴枪吧，缴枪不杀，优待你们！”敌人动摇了。敌群中有个大个子穿着马裤像一个军官，一句话也不说，很多敌人的眼睛都望着他。这时敌人放下二十六枝步枪和一挺重机枪，尹排长很快上去将枪搬过交给该班焦万山同志，随即和七班另六人冲出，捉住五十九个俘虏。那个大个子穿马裤的人，也被他们捉住了。审查俘虏时，才知道他就是胡军三十一旅旅长李纪云。
    【新华社陕北八日电】胡军三十一旅旅长李纪云在延安东北清化砭被俘后，本社前线记者随往晤谈，询以对内战感想，李称：“我心绪已乱，不知该说什么。”但当访问其部下士兵，却都滔滔不绝地谈。被解放的该部二等兵杨喜廉带笑答道：“谁愿打内战呢？我们是被强迫来打的。我们一个排长因为逃避内战给人家枪毙了。”
