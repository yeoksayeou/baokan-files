　　Boai Battalion Soldier Wu Qikuan
    One Man Against an Entire Enemy Battalion
    [This News Report] A unit of the Boai Battalion and over a hundred political workers were stationed in Zhangruji, Fourth District of Boai. On the afternoon of March 13th, an enemy battalion from Qinghua attacked from three directions—one from the west and two from the northwest. At this time, Wu Qikuan, a new soldier of the Third Company, and Comrade ×× were on guard in the northwest corner. Seeing that the enemy was approaching quickly, he told his partner to go back and report. He stood firm at his post alone, without any panic. The enemy advanced with their guns. He fired "Bang! Bang!" twice, and the enemy fell to the ground. After a while, the enemy advanced again, and he fired "Bang! Bang!..." a few more shots, repeatedly preventing the enemy from advancing. After fighting for more than a quarter of an hour, he covered our army's retreat. Therefore, everyone gave him the glorious title: "Model Fighter."

　　博爱营兵吴启宽
    一人抗敌一个营
    【本报讯】博爱营兵一部和政工人员百余人，驻到博爱四区张如集。三月十三日下午清化敌一个营分三路——西一路，西北两路前来夹击，这时正是三连新战士吴启宽和××同志在西北角上站岗，眼看敌人已快接近了，便叫那个伙伴回去报讯。他单人坚守岗位，毫不惶张。敌人端着枪前进，他“拍！拍！”两枪，敌人卧倒了。隔一会，敌人又前进，他又是“拍！拍！……”的几枪，一连几次都阻止了敌人前进。打了一刻多钟，把我军掩护着退却下来。于是大家便送给他一个光荣的称号：“模范战斗员”。
