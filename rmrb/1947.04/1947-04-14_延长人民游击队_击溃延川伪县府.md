　　The Extension People's Guerrilla Force
    Defeats the Puppet Yanchuan County Government
    (Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 12th) Since the enemy troops invaded the border region, they have been subjected to attacks by the people everywhere. On April 5th, the Chiang Kai-shek county government that was "taking office" in Yanchuan was defeated by our guerrillas while passing through a certain place in Extension. Two were killed and the rest fled in panic. The captured seals, signboards, radio stations, documents, business cards, rifles, grenades and other weapons of the puppet Yanchuan County government were all seized by our guerrillas. On April 3rd, the guerrilla force ambushed an enemy transport team west of Majiawan in Extension, killing an enemy company officer, seizing 13 loads of flour, 6 mules and horses, and liberating more than a dozen livestock belonging to the masses. On the 4th, they intercepted 12 enemy mules and horses at Baijiatan, killing and wounding two enemies.
