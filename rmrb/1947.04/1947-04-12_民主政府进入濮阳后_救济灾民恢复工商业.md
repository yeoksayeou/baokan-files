[This newspaper] Hebei-Shandong-Henan, 10th dispatch: After the democratic government entered Puyang City on the 2nd of this month, it is actively providing relief to disaster victims and restoring the industry and commerce that was forced into bankruptcy by the Chiang Kai-shek troops. After two years of vigorous support from the democratic government, the city's industry and commerce had greatly developed, becoming one of the three major commercial cities in Hebei, Shandong, and Henan. After being occupied by the Chiang Kai-shek troops in early December last year, more than 200 newly developed handmade cigarette factories, several native cloth factories with more than 40 iron looms, and more than 20 cotton ginning factories all went bankrupt. The Chiang Kai-shek troops prohibited markets, and all vendors were unemployed. Zhang Erhuang, the largest calico and grain merchant on South Street, more than doubled his business during the democratic government period; after the Chiang Kai-shek troops arrived, calico and grain could not be sold, and he was extorted 1 million yuan by the Chiang Kai-shek troops, eventually going bankrupt. The Three People's Principles Youth League, the Kuomintang county party headquarters, and other institutions arbitrarily sent "loan" requests to various families. More than ten merchants on South Main Street alone were "borrowed" from. The city's 410 salt farmers were previously provided with loans, goods, and tools by the democratic government to help expand their salt fields from seven to ten hectares, and their output increased from 100,000 jin to 1.4 million jin; after the Chiang Kai-shek troops arrived, the salt-leaching tools were looted or destroyed, and salt-leaching was prohibited. This caused 2,200 salt farmers to lose their jobs, and more than half of them became beggars. Guo Xinlai, a salt farmer in West Street, bought 15 mu of land and stored 6 shi of grain in one year during the democratic government period, but now he cannot make a living. The Catholic Church in East Street, the Christian Church in Dongguan, and the Huamei Middle School run by the church were all used as barracks by the Chiang Kai-shek troops. Bullet holes were painted all over the statues of Jesus. The "Home of the Lord" in West Street was used as a stable by the Chiang Kai-shek troops, and the stench was overwhelming. The Christian hospital was also forced to "accept" military use. Medicines and medical equipment were looted. The Chiang Kai-shek troops demolished many civilian houses and built three surrounding stockades, and residents inside and outside the stockades were not allowed to communicate. During the four months and five days of their rule, the Chiang Kai-shek troops buried more than 300 farmers in the city alive, and screams could be heard on the streets every day. In the Chiang family county government's files, many names were marked with "secret knot" (i.e., buried alive).

　　民主政府进入濮阳后
    救济灾民恢复工商业
    【本报冀鲁豫十日电】民主政府于本月二日进入濮阳城后，正积极救济灾民恢复被蒋军逼得大量破产的工商业。该城工商业经过民主政府二年的大力扶植，曾有很大发展，成为冀鲁豫三大商业城市之一。去年十二月初被蒋军侵占后，新发展起来的二百余家手工卷烟厂，数家拥有四十余架铁机的土布厂及二十余家弹花厂全部倒闭。蒋军禁止集市，小贩全部失业。南街最大的花布粮商家张二黄，在民主政府时期，营业发展一倍以上；蒋军到后，花布粮不能成交，并被蒋军敲诈一百万元终于倒闭。三青团、国民党县党部等机关，随意向各家送条“借”款，仅南大街商家被“借”者，即在十家以上。城内四百一十户盐民，以前由民主政府贷款、贷货，贷工具等救济扶助盐田曾由七顷扩大至十顷，产量由十万斤增至一百四十万斤；蒋军到后，淋盐工具被抢走或破坏，并禁止淋盐。使两千二百盐民失业，半数以上流为乞丐。西街盐民郭新来，在民主政府时期一年买地十五亩，存粮六石，现已无法生活。东街天主教堂、东关基督教堂及教会办的华美中学，均被蒋军做了兵营。耶苏像被画满枪眼。西街的“天主之家”做了蒋军马房，臭气熏天。基督教之医院亦被强迫“接受”作为军用。药品医具抢掠一空。蒋军拆去许多民房，增修三道围寨，寨内外居民不准来往。蒋军在其统治的四个月零五天内，活埋该城农民三百人以上，街上每天可听到惨叫。蒋家县政府之卷宗内，许多人名下批着“秘结”（即活埋）二字。
