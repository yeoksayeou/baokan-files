　　【Report from our newspaper in Wu'an】Since the Wu'an County government formulated its production and frugality plan last time, all cadres have established mutual aid production groups. In addition to collecting manure and accumulating fertilizer, they are now working hard on sideline production.
　　Tie flower bundles: Each flower bundle can earn 200 yuan. After dinner, five people can tie ten flower bundles, earning 2,000 yuan, with each person getting 400 yuan. All the cadres transported cloth for Yong Maochang Transportation. Some carried it on poles, others pushed it in carts. In two evenings, they transported more than 20,000 catties. Merchants said as they passed through the streets, "Even the county government cadres are carrying cloth. We must work hard too and can't just sit around waiting to be fed!"
　　Organize firewood cutting: The General Affairs Section prepared sickles, ropes, and other tools. Each catty of firewood cut earns 5 yuan. At first, no one wanted to cut, feeling that it was thorny, laborious, and didn't earn much money, so it was better to engage in other production. After repeated organization and discussion by the leadership, the idea of waiting to earn easy money was overcome. Now everyone is working hard to cut firewood, and they feel that they are earning a lot of money. During the time after dinner, those who are good at cutting can cut 70 or 80 catties, while those who are not good at cutting can cut 30 or 40 catties. Carrying large bundles of firewood back from outside the city, an old lady said, "Oh my! Such a large pile of thorny branches, and people can carry it on their shoulders! Learning to spin flowers isn't thorny, so let's learn well!" Now the county government is divided into four groups, with 28 people participating. The most anyone has earned is 4,000 yuan. Now every cadre is striving to be the first, with those lagging behind learning from those who are ahead, and those who are ahead working even harder, afraid of falling behind again due to busy work. Everyone has a competitive spirit, engaging in intensive production without hindering their work.

　　武安干部打柴运输推动城关群众生产
    【本报武安讯】武安县府自上次订出生产节约计划以后，各干部都成立互助生产小组，除拾粪积肥外，现正努力搞副业生产。扎花包；每个花包可得工资洋二百元。晚饭后，五个人可扎十个花包，赚二千元，每人可得四百元。全体干部给永茂昌运输布，担的担、用车推的推，两个晚饭后时间运完二万余斤。穿街过时商人说：“县政府干部都还扛布哩，咱也得好好劳动，不能光坐着吃等食呀！”
    组织割柴：总务科即制买镰、绳等用具，每割一斤柴赚洋五元。开始都不愿割，觉得又刺手、又出力，还不赚什么钱，倒不如搞其他生产。经领导上一再组织讨论，克服了等待赚巧钱的思想，现在都努力割柴，但感觉赚钱亦不少，吃晚饭后时间，会割的能割七八十斤，不会割的三四十斤，扛着大捆柴，从城外回来，一个老太太说：“哎呀！这么大一堆圪针，人家还能在肩上扛着哩，咱学纺花又不刺手，好好学吧！”现在县府共分四个小组，参加人数是二十八人，最多的有赚四千元的。现在每个干部都争先恐后，落后的向前进的看齐，前进的更努力，恐怕工作忙了，再落后，大家都是一颗竞争的心，在不妨碍工作下紧张生产。
