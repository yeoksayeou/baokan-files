Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, April 24th: According to a Moscow broadcast on the 22nd, Molotov's reply to Marshall regarding the Korean question stated: According to the provisions of the Moscow Agreement on the Korean question, the Joint Commission should consult with Korean democratic parties and social organizations when preparing recommendations. The Soviet delegation insisted on this point. However, the American delegation refused the participation of various parties and social organizations, such as the All-Korea Labor League, the All-Korea Farmers' Association, the Korean National Revolutionary Party, the All-Korea Youth Association, and other groups. Due to the suggestions of the American delegation, the work of the Joint Commission has been forced to stop. In order to break this deadlock, the Soviet Union has taken new steps; in the letter from the Soviet military commander to the American military commander, efforts were made to seek a new basis for restoring the work of the Joint Commission. The American military commander has not yet replied to the Soviet commander's letter of February 28th of this year, so the agreement has not been completed. Molotov, when referring to the democratic reforms in northern Korea, stated: "Since the Japanese surrender, northern Korea has made significant progress in democratization, and the work of economic and cultural restoration has also been completed. I will only point out the main points, such as: the implementation of universal suffrage has begun; equal rights for men and women; the establishment of local organs of power and the North Korean People's Committee based on free and democratic elections; as a result of land reform, 725,000 landless or land-poor peasants obtained more than one million hectares (hectares) of land without compensation, which was originally the property of Japanese colonists and their accomplices; former Japanese industries were nationalized; the eight-hour work system; labor safety and social insurance; reform of national education, restoration and expansion of schools, and increased student enrollment, etc." Molotov finally suggested: "The Soviet Union implements its policy towards Korea in accordance with the program stipulated in the Moscow Agreement, recognizing the following tasks as the most important: 1. To establish a provisional Korean democratic government on the basis of the extensive participation of Korean democratic parties and social organizations, in order to promote the political and economic unification of Korea, and to become an independent country free from foreign interference. Only in this way can the phenomenon of division between North and South Korea be eliminated. 2. To establish democratic organs of power in various parts of Korea through free elections based on equality and universality. 3. To assist the Korean nation in restoring Korea as an independent and democratic country, and to develop its national economy and culture. The Soviet government hopes that Korea will soon be restored as a unified and independent country. In order to fulfill this consistent desire of the Soviet Union, I suggest that the Soviet-American Joint Commission resume its work in Seoul, Korea, on May 20th, strictly implement the Moscow Agreement regarding the Korean part, and submit the results of its work in formulating recommendations for the establishment of a provisional Korean government to the Soviet and American governments for consideration between July and August 1947.

　　莫洛托夫函马歇尔谈朝鲜问题
    建议成立临时民主政府
    促进朝鲜政治经济统一
    【新华社陕北二十四日电】据莫斯科二十二日广播：莫洛托夫致马歇尔关于朝鲜问题之复函略称：按照莫斯科协议关于朝鲜问题之规定，联合委员会准备建议时应与朝鲜各民主党派和社会团体进行协商。苏联代表团是坚持此点的。但美国代表团却拒绝各党派及社会团体的参加，如全朝鲜劳工联盟、全朝鲜农民协会、朝鲜民族革命党、全朝鲜青年协会以及其他各团体。由于美国代表团的建议，联合委员会的工作已经被迫停止了。为了打破这种僵局，苏联已采取新的步骤；在苏军司令给美军司令的信中，曾努力寻求建立恢复联合委员会工作的新基础。美军司令对苏司令今年二月二十八日之信尚无复函，故协议还未完成。莫氏于述及朝鲜北部民主改革时称：“自日本投降以后，朝鲜北部在民主化方面已有显著的进步，而且经济文化的恢复工作也已完成了。我仅指出主要的几项，如：开始实行了普选制；男女平权法；根据自由民主的选举，建立地方权利机关及朝鲜北部人民委员会；土地改革结果，七十二万五千无地或少地的农民，毫无代价的获得土地一百余万海克脱（公顷），这些土地原为日本殖民者及其帮凶们之财产；前日本工业收归国有；八小时工作制；劳工安全与社会保险；改革国民教育，恢复与广设学校，增加学生名额等等。”莫氏最后建议称：“苏联依据莫斯科协议规定之纲领，执行其对朝鲜之政策，认定下列工作最为主要：一、在朝鲜民主政党及社会团体广泛参加的基础上，建立临时朝鲜民主政府，以促进朝鲜政治与经济之统一，而成为一个脱离外国干涉的自主的国家。如此，始能消除朝鲜南北分裂之现象。二、用基于平等普遍的自由选举方式，在朝鲜各地设立民主的权利机关。三、援助朝鲜民族，使其恢复朝鲜为独立民主的国家，并发展其国民经济与文化。苏联政府希望朝鲜早日恢复为统一自主的国家，为了符合苏联这种一贯的愿望，我建议：苏美联合委员会于五月二十日在朝鲜京城恢复工作，谨严的执行关于朝鲜部分之莫斯科协议，并于一九四七年七月至八月间，将其制定建立朝鲜临时政府的建议书之工作结果，提交苏美两国政府考虑。
