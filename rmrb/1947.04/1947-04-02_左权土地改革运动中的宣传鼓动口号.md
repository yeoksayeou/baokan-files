This is a collection of slogans guiding the ideology, policies, and actions of the masses during different periods of the land reform and emancipation movement. Its characteristic is using the language of the masses, simple expressions, and idioms to resolve ideological problems among the masses, providing clear enlightenment and courage to promote and enhance their ideological awareness, forming a large-scale mass movement. Experience has proven that it has played a significant role in promoting the development and progress of the movement. It is now preliminarily organized as follows for reference by various regions.

I. Finding and Introducing Bitterness, Igniting the Flames of Class Revenge:

In the search for the roots of poverty, the following was proposed: "Renting with large measures, interest rolling like a black donkey, piling up year after year, never being able to pay it off generation after generation;" "Landlords have never suffered, where did all that flesh come from;" "Uncover the stone slab to find the roots of poverty, we must settle accounts with the landlords;" "We must settle the blood debts, we must pour out our grievances." Using comparisons of actual life to break the peasants' ideas of conscience: "The green stone slab, the stone slab is green, landlords and bullies have lost their conscience, rich people live in tall buildings and big houses, rich people use pork and rice;" "The poor people are so miserable, without clothes in the dead of winter, driven out in the freezing cold, no one cares if they starve or freeze to death;" "After finding the roots of poverty, immediately guide the removal of the roots of poverty;" "Peasants unite closely, take back the blood and sweat to emancipate ourselves;" "Farmers all over the world are one family, eliminate landlords and bullies." At this time, although the peasants recognized the justice and rationality of emancipation, they were still afraid to move forward boldly. At this time, it was proposed: "Thoroughly struggle and thoroughly calculate, we will demand blood and sweat from the landlords." When cadres were hesitant and afraid to let go and lead the peasants forward, it was proposed: "Don't be afraid of criticism from superiors, only be afraid of peasants not being thoroughly emancipated." When the struggle began and the landlords resisted stubbornly, it was proposed: "Speak frankly and truthfully, we will definitely be lenient;" "Sweet words are useless, blood debts must be repaid;" "The masses are not extorting you, they are asking you to repay our blood debts." The response to the landlords' idea of enduring this "stage" was: "The struggle is not a matter of one day, blood debts must be repaid." In this way, some landlords sought death by hanging themselves to scare the peasants, which caused quite a shock to the peasants who had just risen up, so it was proposed: "Dying or running away is useless, blood debts must be repaid." Regarding internal problems of the peasants, it was proposed: "First unite ourselves, then we can defeat the enemy;" "People of our own family turn against each other, making the landlords happy;" "Adjust the ranks of the united front and aim the guns at the landlords to fire together;" "Middle and poor peasants are one family, landlords are our old creditors;" "Middle and poor peasants must be of one heart, we will launch a general offensive against the landlords;" "Middle peasants are flesh and blood, poor and impoverished peasants are bones, landlords are all wolf mouths." The solution to problems between each other was: "Farmers all over the world are one family, resolve misunderstandings between each other." Moreover, distinguish the different nature of problems from a class point of view: "Peasants' occupation is for small gains, landlords' occupation relies on power and bullying;" "Handle your own affairs through consultation, handle the landlords' affairs thoroughly."

II. Distributing the Fruits and Filling the Holes, the Entire Class is Emancipated

It was first proposed: "Everyone is emancipated, the poorest are the first;" "Distribute the crumbs to fill the holes, fill the holes first and then pave the way." The principle of distribution is: "The fruits must be fair, let everyone discuss;" "The fruits must be fair, always distribute according to needs" (guiding principle). When the division of the camp due to the struggle for fruits occurred, it was proposed: "Divide the large ones appropriately (referring to land, houses, livestock, and farm tools), let the small ones be tight (daily necessities)." In the later stage, when the mood of wanting livestock and cash, but not wanting land was created, it was proposed: "Eating depends on millet, emancipation depends on land." For the unity of farmers and merchants, use: "Tillers have their land, merchants have their capital." The distribution method is: "Make the fruits public and clear, everyone cares;" "Propose yourself (what you want) and let everyone evaluate, to be reasonable and touching."

III. Establishing the Concept of the Entire Class and Resolving Internal Disputes

When checking whether the fruits are fair, it is proposed: "If the fruits are not distributed fairly, the landlords will take advantage of the loopholes;" "If the fruits are distributed fairly, everyone will discuss, and the cadres and the masses will be of one heart" (guiding slogan). "All the poor people in the whole village are emancipated, no one is missed from near or far;" "To be emancipated together, not delaying a single poor person," overcoming village centrism, it is proposed, "Poor villages and rich villages are all emancipated, near and far are one family." To further overcome village centrism from the perspective of class consciousness, "Our village's poor people are all emancipated, not forgetting the poor brothers in other villages;" "Only recognize your own family, regardless of near and far villages;" "Poor people do not forget poor people." In this period of stabilizing the emotions of the middle peasants, it was proposed: "All things offered by the middle peasants will be returned to them." When systematically carrying out ideological education, it was proposed: "Emancipation requires turning the heart, thoroughly changing the mind;" "In the past, blood and sweat did not enter the door, today the blood and sweat are returned home;" "In the past, we were oppressed and lost land, today we are greatly emancipated and recovering lost land."

IV. Mobilizing the Backward, Rectifying Relationships, Improving Awareness, and Collapsing Feudalism

The overall action slogan for this stage is "Mobilize the backward to squeeze out feudalism, unite all to collapse feudalism," "Emancipation requires turning the heart, men, women, old and young, changing their minds." Mobilizing the backward, it is proposed among activists: "Do not abandon a single poor brother, do not abandon a single backward person;" "Backwardness is not innate, we all came from there;" "Unite the backward to plug the holes, not allowing the landlords to scrape in the wind." The understanding and analysis of the backward stratum is: "We lose the backward, the landlords pick up the backward, we lose one, the landlords pick up one, we lose a lot, the landlords pick up a lot." Among the cadres, it was proposed: "The backward fall behind, we pushed them away, we lost them, we look for them," using "Think about the past and compare it to the present, look at yourself and compare it to others" to inspire their class consciousness. Regarding the failure to mobilize the backward, hindering the complete completion of the movement, it was proposed: "Landlords do not bow their heads, there are backers around" (meaning relying on the backward), "Landlords are not convinced, there is no reasoning to be done;" "The backward do not speak, the landlords cannot be overthrown;" "Emancipation is not solid if the backward do not rise up;" "Feudalism cannot be squeezed out if the backward are not mobilized;" "Landlords will not collapse if the backward do not rise up;" "Grievances are not fully expressed, the landlords will not bow their heads;" "Peasants are not united, the landlords will not give up." Among the backward masses, appeals were made using: "Poor brothers are all emancipated, not acting as landlords' air raid shelters;" "Poor brothers, emancipate yourselves, not acting as landlords' umbrella handles" (meaning not supporting the landlords), "Poor brothers thoroughly emancipated, not acting as landlords' broadcasting horns;" "Poor brothers thoroughly emancipated, not acting as landlords' telegraph poles;" "It doesn't matter if you keep things for the landlords, but it will ruin the hearts of our peasants;" "What does it matter to want some things, ruining unity is a big deal." In resolving cadre-mass relations, it is proposed to cadres: "In the past, we were all subjected to control, today we should all be emancipated;" "Share food together, ride horses together;" "The fruits are the blood and sweat of the masses, do not take a needle or a thread more." The masses proposed to the cadres: "Resolving misunderstandings is to reduce 'loss of face,' not just to make trouble for things;" "Cadres wash their faces and mutually examine and resolve misunderstandings." To resolve misunderstandings among middle and poor peasants, it is proposed: "Delineate the ranks, mutually discuss and resolve misunderstandings." Regarding non-feudal and not heinous pseudo-personnel: "Wash your face and wipe away the black to resolve misunderstandings, everyone unite and the strength is great." From the cadres withdrawing the excessive fruits, the masses realized the comparison between the two societies (i.e., social consciousness): "In the past, passing through a layer of yamen peeled off a layer of skin, now the excessive fruits are returned." The villages turning to production are proposed: "Settle debts clearly and emancipate thoroughly, organize production and plant the roots of wealth;" "Everyone has become rich, thank the Communist Party and Mao Zedong;" "Chairman Mao is very meritorious, he knows our great suffering, leads us to emancipate ourselves, and wants to eliminate feudalism."

　　左权土地改革运动中的宣传鼓动口号
    这是土地改革翻身运动中各个不同时期指导群众思想政策行动口号的汇集。它的特点是用群众的语言板话成语解决了群众中的思想问题，并给以明确启示与勇气，用以推动与提高其思想觉悟，形成规模宏大的群众运动。经验证明：它在推动运动的发展与前进上，是起了很大作用的。现初步整理如下，供各地参考。
    一、找苦引苦，燃起阶级复仇火焰：
    在找穷根中提出：“刮租用大斗，利钱黑驴滚，一年垒一年，辈辈还不清”，“地主彻根就没受，从那来哩一身肉”，“揭石板找穷根，要和地主把债清”，“血债咱要算，苦水咱要诉”。用实际生活对比，打破农民良心思想：“青石板石板青，地主恶霸丧良心，高楼大房富人住，猪肉大米财主用”；“穷人们真凄惶，十冬腊月没衣裳，冰天雪地赶出门，饿死冻死没人问”，“找了穷根后，随即引导拔穷根”，“农民团结紧，收回血汗来翻身”，“天下农民是一家，消灭地主和恶霸”。就在这个时候，农民虽然认识翻身的正义性与合理性，但还不敢大踏步前进，此时即提出“彻底斗彻底算，咱向地主要血汗”。对干部的畏首畏尾不敢放手领导农民前进时，即提出：“不怕上级来批评，光怕农民翻不透身”。当开始斗争，地主顽抗，便提出：“坦白说实话，我们定宽大”，“花言巧语不顶事，还不了血债不了事”，“群众不是讹你哩，是叫还俺血债哩”。对地主熬过这一期的“阶段”思想回答是：“斗争不是一日事，还不了血债不了事”。这样一来有些地主就寻死上吊吓唬农民，这对农民刚起来震荡颇大，即提出：“死了跑了不顶事，还不了血债不了事。”对农民内部问题提出：“首先团结自己，才能打倒敌人，”“自家人反眼睛，正给地主闹高兴”，“团结阵营调正枪口，对准地主一齐开火”，“中贫农是一家，地主是咱老做家”，“中贫农要一心，咱向地主总进攻”，“中农户是血肉，贫农赤贫是骨头，地主都是狼嘴头”。对互相之间问题解决办法是：“天下农民是一家，相互之间解疙瘩”。而且从阶级观点上办别问题性质的不同：“农民霸占见小利，地主霸占仗势欺”，“自己事情商议办，地主事情彻底干”。
    二、分果实填窟窿整个阶级都翻身
    最先提出：“大家都翻身，赤贫第一名”，“分圪台填窟窿，先填窟窿后铺平”。分配原则是：“果实要公平，大家来讨论”，“果实要公平，总得按需分”（指导方针），当产生了争夺果实阵营分化时即提出：“大哩分适当（指土地房屋牲畜农具），小哩要紧让（日用品）”。后段产生谁都想要牲畜现款，不愿要土地情绪时，即提出：“吃饭靠小米，翻身靠土地”。对农商团结用：“耕者有其田，商者有本钱”。分配方法是：“果实公布清，人人都操心”，“自己提（愿要啥）大家评，作到合理又碰心”。
    三、树立整个阶级观念解决内部纠纷
    检查果实公不公时提出“果实分不公，地主钻大空”，“果实分公平，大家来讨论，干部群众便一心”（方针口号）。“全村穷人都翻身，远近不漏一个人”，“要翻一齐翻，穷人一个不耽闪”，克服村本位时提出“穷村富村都翻身，远近都是一家人”。更进一步从阶级觉悟上来克服村本位思想“咱村穷人都翻身，不忘外村穷弟兄”，“光认自家人，不分远近村”，“穷苦人不忘穷苦人”。在这段稳定中农情绪上提出“凡是中农献东西，一律给他送回去”。在系统思想教育时提出“翻身要翻心，彻底换脑筋”，“过去是血汗不进门，今天是血汗还家”，“过去受压迫丧失土地，今天大翻身收复失地”。
  四、发动落后整关系提高觉悟垮封建
    这段总的行动口号是“发动落后挤封建，团结全体垮封建”，“翻身要翻心，男女老少换脑筋。”发动落后在积极分子中提出：“不丢一个穷兄弟，不丢一个落后人”，“落后不是生就来，咱从那里过来”，“团结落后堵窟窿，不叫地主刮进风”。对落后层认识与分析是“咱们丢落后，地主拾落后，咱们丢一个，地主拾一个，咱们丢的多，地主拾的多”。在干部中这样提出“落后掉了队，是咱碰走来，咱们丢了咱们寻”，用“想过去比现在，看自己比旁人”来启发其阶级自觉。对不发动落后，妨碍运动彻底完成时，提出“地主不低头，周围有靠头”（意即靠落后），“地主不服气，没啦讲通理”，“落后不说话，地主整不垮”，“落后不起来，翻身不牢固”，“落后不发动，封建挤不净”，“落后不起来地主不垮台”，“冤苦没诉透，地主不低头”，“农民不齐心，地主不死心”。在落后群众中进行号召动员用“穷弟兄者都翻身，不当地主防空洞”，“穷弟兄翻身吧，不当地主雨伞把”（意即不给地主撑台），“穷兄弟翻透身，不当地主广播筒），“穷兄弟彻底翻，不当地主肉电杆”，“给地主保存东西不要紧，可就坏了咱农民一条心”，“要些东西算些啥，坏了团结是大事情”。解决干群关系中，对干部提出“过去同是受制人，今天应该都翻身”，“有饭同吃，有马同骑”，“果实是群众血汗，不多拿一针一线”。群众对干部提出是“解疙瘩为了去‘面薄’不是光为闹东西”，“干部洗脸互相检讨解疙瘩”，对解决中贫农疙瘩提出“划清阵营，互相商议解疙瘩”。对非封建又非罪大恶极的伪属人员是“洗脸擦黑解疙瘩，大家团结力量大”。群众从干部退出多得果实中，体会到两个社会对比（即社会自觉）：“过去过一层衙门剥一层皮，如今多得果实还退回去”。转向生产中的村是提出“算清债务翻透身，组织生产栽富根”，“大家发了财，感谢共产党毛泽东”，“毛主席顶有功，他知道咱们大苦情，领导咱们翻了身，要把封建消灭净”。
