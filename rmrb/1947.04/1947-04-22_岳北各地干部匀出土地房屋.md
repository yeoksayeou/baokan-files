    [This newspaper, Taiyue, 20th] According to a report from the Yuebei Branch: After cadres in Tunliu, Qin County, Qinyuan, Huo County, Pingyao and other counties read the editorial in the Taiyue Xinhua Daily calling for the return of excessively acquired fruits, they underwent a period of intense ideological struggle. Finally, they overcame selfish thoughts with the revolutionary idea of "serving the people and making contributions" and happily returned the excess fruits. After the Tunliu County Farmers' Association gained experience from breakthroughs in the Second District, it issued instructions to work groups in various key villages: "All cadres, in addition to retaining the land, houses, and livestock needed by a middle peasant, must hand over the excess to help all peasants stand up." The exemplary role of the leading cadres of the Huo County Farmers' Association promoted the leading cadres below to return fruits. In Qin County, the two key point organizations of Fancun in the urban area organized cadres to discuss the Xinhua Daily editorial, reflected on themselves in connection with their own situation, sought ideological awareness, and returned fruits. The Second District launched a movement to stand up and help each other, and cadres have already returned excess fruits and continue to lead the effort to stand up. Cadres and activists from the four joint defense villages of Nanli, Zhangzhuang, Tangcun, and Beidishui held a love-the-people meeting and voluntarily returned excess fruits to the masses. Wang Fuquan, chairman of the Nanli Farmers' Association, Shi Jiuhai, director of the Armed Forces Committee, and others apologized to the masses on the spot and returned sixty-four pieces of clothing, sixteen rooms, twenty rafters, and many pieces of furniture. The masses said: "The cadres led everyone to defeat the landlords and bullies, and also took out the excess fruits to let everyone thoroughly stand up. We will obey the leadership of the cadres even more in the future." In the two villages of Congziyu and Caiziping in the Fourth District of Qinyuan, under the leadership of the village head and the chairman of the Farmers' Association, all cadres returned 87 mu of land and one house. Yaitouhui Village in the Fifth District also began to return land and houses. Cadres in Pingyao regard helping the masses stand up by returning excess fruits as a virtue of revolutionaries. Comrades Ji Long and Zhang Zhenlin of the County Farmers' Association returned cheaply purchased fox fur coats, quilt covers, and silk items. Zhao Huiwu and Wang Shengwu returned land "supported" by the masses, along with the seedlings they had cultivated themselves. Wang Sixian, in leading the mass movement, had been "supported" by the masses with one stone and two dou of wheat, which had already been eaten, so he compensated at the market price. Cadres at all county-level systems have guaranteed that all fruits purchased cheaply or "supported" will be returned by the end of April.
