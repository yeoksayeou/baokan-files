　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 11th: The US Information Service reports: The New Republic commented on the Chinese situation on March 5th, stating that even if Chiang Kai-shek's military actions "succeed," he cannot solve all of his problems. The Chiang family government, a Kuomintang autocratic regime, must be reorganized to allow representatives of other parties to participate in national affairs. The resignation of T.V. Soong has not changed its predicament. Allowing a small number of representatives from other parties to participate in the Legislative Yuan, Control Yuan, and National Political Council is also of little benefit. Although the Youth Party and the Democratic Socialist Party participate, the Legislative Yuan still maintains a ratio of 116 Kuomintang members to 33 members from other parties; the Control Yuan has 58 Kuomintang members compared to 16 from minority parties; and in the 33 seats of the National Political Council, minority parties only occupy three seats, with the rest monopolized by the Kuomintang. Representatives of parties that truly speak for millions of Chinese people have not participated in the Executive Yuan. Although the "government has been reorganized," the reorganization of the Chinese government called for in Marshall's report has not been realized. From many symbolic perspectives, Chiang Kai-shek is sinking into the mud, and he is still employing the customary tricks of reorganizing the government that he has used in many difficult periods in the past. Unless there is a sincere effort to transform the Nanjing government into a representative government, especially in important administrative departments, no "victory" over the Communist army can lead China to the road of reconstruction.

　　美报纸评论中国局势
    蒋政府陷于泥沼
    独裁统治应彻底改组
    【新华社陕北十一日电】美国新闻处息：美公论报于三月五日评中国局势称：即使蒋介石军事行动“获胜”，他也不能解决他的全部问题。国民党独裁统治的蒋家政府必须改组，允许其他党派代表参加国事。宋子文的引退，并未改变其窘境。准许其他政党的少数代表参加立法院、监察院与国民参政会，也没有什么裨益。虽然有青年党和民社党的参加，立法院仍保持国民党一一六与其他党三三之比；监察院是国民党五八比少数党的十六；而在国民参政会三三席中，少数党仅占三三席，其余都是被国民党独占的。真正替数百万中国人民说话的政党代表，并未参加行政院。虽“政府业已改组”，马歇尔的报告中所呼吁的改组中国政府，亦并未实现。从多方面的象征去看，蒋介石是正陷于泥沼中，他仍采用与过去许多窘迫时期曾经运用过的改组政府的习惯伎俩。除非有一种诚意的努力，使南京政府特别在重要的行政部门中，变为代议性质的政府，决没有什么对中共军的“胜利”能使中国走向重新建设的道路。
