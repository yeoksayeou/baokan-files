　　Distribute Good and Bad Land Equally
    Southern Hebei Implements Land Leveling
    Guarantee Everyone Can Stand Up
    [Our Newspaper, Southern Hebei, 10th Dispatch] Southern Hebei is implementing land leveling between good and bad land. In Sha Wan Village, Longping First District, land is close to the Sha River, and most of the land is sandy and alkaline, with a large difference between good and bad land. When distributing the fruits of labor, good land often fell into the hands of village cadres, which affected the leveling efforts for poor households. Zhao Laoxing, the secretary of the village office, received twelve mu of good land, while Wang Genda, a dirt-poor peasant, received fourteen mu of distant sandy land. The masses were not very satisfied with this. During the great examination of standing up, the method of "comparing land with land" was adopted at the democratic meeting, differentiating between superior and inferior land according to yield. After group discussions, land leveling between good and bad land was implemented. In Dong Yingye, Feixiang First District, the chairman of the farmers' association and the village chief took good land, while Wang Changhe, a dirt-poor peasant, received eighteen mu of wasteland. All thirty-one households who received land raised opinions on this aspect. After the village cadres reflected and examined themselves, they voluntarily withdrew the excess. In Guo Fenggu, Yuanchao Fifth District, the land distribution was not based on the principle of leveling and making up deficiencies. The militia captain used his thirty mu of bad land to exchange for thirty mu of good land. During the clearing of the fruits of labor, the leadership discovered these problems. After patiently educating the village cadres, they realized that it was wrong to exchange for good land and take more good things. After mass discussion, everyone believed that "regardless of cadres or the masses, everyone has just climbed out of the mud pit. They have already recognized their mistakes. As long as everyone re-rationally distributes land, there is no need to pursue small items like floating wealth." Currently, the good and bad land in the village has been re-rationed.
    [Our Newspaper, Taiyue, 10th Dispatch] Qin County encourages cadres to divide up the extra fruits of their labor. In addition to continuing to investigate feudal remnants during the review, the county is also launching an education campaign of "one person stands up, everyone stands up" to open up the minds of cadres and consciously divide up the extra fruits of their labor to help everyone stand up. Village cadres and households with extra fruits of labor all made strict self-criticisms. Before reviewing themselves, the cadres of Guo Jia Zhuang Village first visited every household to inquire about their situation in standing up. As a result, they found that five households had no houses to live in, and one farmer had received several mu of land, but his whole family of eight had only one room. He was about to marry off his son, but he dared not mention the lack of a house to the cadres. After seeing this situation, the chairman of the farmers' association, Wei Guohua, returned home and looked at his tall buildings and mansions. A fierce struggle began in his heart, and he repeatedly thought, "Everyone is a liberated peasant, why are some people squeezed without a place to live, while my house cannot be fully occupied?" Finally, he made up his mind to divide up three rooms. This influenced other cadres and people with extra fruits of labor, who also volunteered to divide up houses and land. The main experience in this division of fruits of labor is that after one person makes a breakthrough, the movement will unfold smoothly. For example, Guo Jia Zhuang Village launched the movement from the example of Guo Gaozhao, a straightforward and quick-witted farmers' association cadre, taking the lead; he first divided up one dan of rice, and the chairman of the farmers' association underwent a fierce ideological struggle, and voluntarily gave up three good houses. After the cadres divided up the fruits of their labor, Duan Xueyou, Duan Sanzha and other households with extra fruits of labor also naturally offered houses and land. They said, "The cadres are leading the masses to stand up, how much credit is that, and they are not willing to take a little more. Why should we get more than others!" Through the division of fruits of labor, the estrangement between the masses and the cadres has also been resolved through mutual assistance and mutual concession.
    Supporting Farmers in Standing Up
    Linqing County Agencies
    Give Up Thousands of Mu of Land
    [Our Newspaper, Southern Hebei, 10th Dispatch] In order to solve the land problem for farmers, the Eighth Sub-district's core regiment has returned 750 mu of land confiscated by the government from traitors in the Gaotang X Guanzhuang area to the local government, to be distributed to farmers in poor villages in the area. The Linqing County District Party, government, people, and military organizations have distributed all 1,042 mu of land farmed by their own agencies to seven poor villages, and used wasteland along threshing grounds and embankments for their own agency production.
    Nanfeng Adjusts Land
    Farmers from Poor Villages Relocate
    [Our Newspaper, Southern Hebei-Shandong-Henan, 6th Dispatch] Nanfeng implemented filling gaps and making up deficiencies, and the Fourth District adjusted land between rich and poor villages, relocating farmers from poor villages to rich villages. Twenty-five households with more than 150 people from Li Tai and Yangdian Villages have moved to Xu Ji. The masses in Li Tai and other villages beat gongs and drums and collectively sent them off, and the masses in Xu Ji warmly welcomed them.

　　好地坏地搭配分
    冀南各地实行换平
    保证人人都翻身
    【本报冀南十日电】冀南各地实行好坏地填平。隆平一区沙湾村靠近沙河，土地多系沙碱，好坏地差别很大，分果实时，好地多落村干部手里，影响了贫苦户填平，村公所书记赵老兴分了十二亩好地，一赤贫王根大却分到十四亩远沙地。群众对此不大满意。翻身大检查中，在民主会上，采用“以地比地”的办法，按产量分别优劣，经过小组讨论，实行了好坏地填平。肥乡一区东营业，农会主任、村长分好地，赤贫王长合却分了十八亩荒地，共卅一户分地户，都提出这方面的意见。经过村干反省检查后，自动退出。元朝五区郭封固分地不是按填平补齐的原则分的，民兵队长拿自己的三十亩坏地换了三十亩好地，清理果实中领导上发觉这些问题后，耐心教育村干部，认识自己换好地多分好东西的不对。经过群众讨论，大家认为“不论干部群众，都是刚从泥坑里爬出来的，已经认清错误，只要大家重新合理分配土地，浮财等小物件倒不必穷追。”现该村好坏地已重新进行搭配。
    【本报太岳十日电】沁县启发干部匀出多得果实。该县在复查中除继续查封建尾巴外，并展开“一人翻身大家翻身”的教育，借以打通干部思想，自觉的匀出多得果实，帮助大家翻身。各村干部及多得果实户皆作了严格的自我检讨。郭家庄村干部在检讨自己前，先挨门挨户的访问大家的翻身情形；结果发现五户没有房子住，一户农民得到几亩土地，但全家八口人仅有一间房，眼前就要给儿子娶媳妇，没房子也不敢向干部提。农会主席卫国华见此情况后，回到家里，看看自己得到的高楼大厦，内心便激烈的斗争起来，反复的想着：“大家都是翻身农民，为什么人家挤的没处住，咱的房子住不了呢？”最后下决心，匀出三间房子。这一来影响了其他干部及多得果实的人，亦相继自报匀出房屋土地。此次匀果实中主要经验是：从一个人突破以后，运动便顺利的展开。如郭家庄是从启发一个心直口快的农会干部郭高照带头而掀起运动的；他首先匀出一石米，农会主席内心就作了一番激烈的思想斗争，自愿让出三间好房子。干部匀出果实后，多得果实户段学有、段三扎等，亦自然的拿出房屋土地来。他们说：“人家干部领导群众翻身，该有多大功劳，亦不愿多得一点东西，咱凭啥要比别人多得呢！”经过匀果实，群众与干部的隔阂，亦在互助互让中得到解决。
    扶助农民翻身
    临清县各机关
    让出土地千亩
    【本报冀南十日电】八分区基干团，为解决农民土地问题，已将在高唐×官屯一带所种政府没收的汉奸土地七百五十亩，退交当地政府，分给该地贫村农民。临清县区党、政、民、武，将自己机关种地一千零四十二亩，全部分给七个贫村，自己以场头堰边荒地来作机关生产。
    南峰调剂土地
    贫村农民移居
    【本报冀鲁豫六日电】南峰实行填平补齐，四区调剂贫富村土地，将贫村农民迁移至富村。李台、杨店村已有二十五户一百五十余人移到徐集。李台等村群众锣鼓喧天，集体欢送，徐集群众亦热烈欢迎。
