    [Special Dispatch from this newspaper] Since the Central Bureau pointed out that the achievements of the Sixth Column in implementing the mass line were a new direction for building the people's army, the troops of the Taihang Military Region have risen up to respond and learn; recently, at the study meeting of cadres above the regiment level in the region, Deputy Political Commissar Huang Zhen specifically made a speech on the Taihang troops' humble learning of the mass line experience of the Sixth Column and the Gutian Conference. He said: The Taihang troops have achieved preliminary results in learning from the experience of the Sixth Column. First, the cadres' thinking has gradually become clear from being unclear or not very clear, and they have learned to use the working methods of the mass line from their actual work. Secondly, the basic organizations of the mass line—mutual aid groups—have been universally established in the troops, and a relatively enthusiastic campaign to establish merit has been launched. The enthusiasm and creativity of the masses have been fully developed. The mass discipline in the troops' work, the education and consolidation of new recruits, and the work of winning over prisoners have all immediately achieved great results. In particular, the results are even more significant in training. For example, in learning the mass line, the leadership of the ×× unit deeply grasped the typical experience, creating a training upsurge, and the spring training task can be completed in ten days. When implementing the working methods of the mass line, the ×× unit made good use of the hero meetings, strengthened the ideological education of cadres and soldiers, inspired the enthusiasm of the masses, and improved the efficiency of the political work of the troops. In learning and implementing the mass line, the ×× unit vigorously carried out the merit-establishment campaign, and timely summarized the experience, concentrated it and persisted in it, achieving great results and playing a great exemplary role for other units.
    Next, Deputy Political Commissar Huang specifically introduced the experience of the Taihang troops in specifically using the mass line method when completing a task or a piece of work:
    Leaders Take Responsibility and Personally Start to Enlighten the Masses' Ideological Awareness
    (1) When deploying a work task, it is necessary to realize that leaders take responsibility and personally start. How to take responsibility? How to start? With the leader as the center, one central work for a period of time, supplemented by the second and third work, all departments cooperate consistently, the leader and leading backbone should go deep down to the bottom, combine with the broad masses, understand the masses' emotions, listen to opinions, make their decisions more correct, and then carry out deliberation, cultivate correct public opinion and the masses' enthusiastic emotions, and then carry out in-depth mobilization, put forward general calls and specific methods, and then mobilize the masses to discuss. The work tasks and methods proposed by the leadership are understood by the masses, their thinking is prepared, and with the leading and exemplary role of the leading backbone activists and leaders, the mass movement will be launched. Leaders go deep into the lower levels, personally help one or two units to gain experience as guidance, find shortcomings and quickly correct them, so that the movement will not be interrupted and the task will not fail.
    (2) Carry out universal and in-depth political mobilization, ideological education, and enlighten the masses' ideological awareness. How to carry out ideological mobilization? After a task comes down, first carry out ideological deliberation universally to connect everyone's thinking; on the basis of establishing correct thinking, enlighten the consciousness of each comrade, and the thinking and emotions of the leadership will naturally become the thinking, emotions, and actions of the masses. A heated mass movement will soon be launched. How to carry out ideological deliberation? After a task is determined, cadres first conduct investigation and research to understand the masses' emotions, and conduct education in light of various ideas and realities, convene some very effective meetings, mobilize correct public opinion, and make heroes and models play a good leading bridge role. After mutual education between old soldiers, new soldiers, and liberated soldiers, and mastering newspapers and other mobilization methods, help activists to put forward their own goals of effort and methods to complete the task. (The plans made by activists should not be too high, otherwise it will affect everyone's emotions. The plans made by the leadership should also be based on the level of the majority of people, otherwise they will be out of touch with the masses and fail.) For the wavering emotions of the middle elements, do not rush to criticize, let them consider, the leaders and activists should slowly guide them to transform. Let the backward expose their emotions, understand their emotions, and do not easily criticize them, so as not to make them discouraged. After deliberation, make their positive emotions gradually grow. Wavering stops, backwardness reduces, this is a sign of ideological maturity. At this time, a mobilization meeting should be convened, and the leaders can put forward the tasks and the favorable conditions for completing the tasks, heroes and models speak, make plans, discuss, and promote collective plan making. If the task is more difficult, and the confidence is not high enough after mobilization, it is best to find good successful examples to illustrate and explain, so as to strengthen everyone's confidence. A task cannot be solved by one or two mobilizations from the beginning to the end, and continuous mobilization must be carried out according to the development of the movement; the method is not fixed, and can take the form of general meetings, platoon meetings, individual talks, etc. In short, it is carried out according to needs.
    Organizing Revolutionary Emulation Must Have In-Depth Mobilization
    (3) Regarding the organization of various revolutionary emulations. Organizing revolutionary emulation is a method of mobilizing the enthusiasm of the masses to the highest degree. There are two types of this kind of emulation: one is longer-term; the other is short-term with a commando nature. The conditions are simple, the goals are clear, and it is easy to arouse everyone's emotions. Emulation must have in-depth mobilization to create a heated emulation atmosphere before the conditions are considered mature. In addition, there must be good organizational work, cadres must avoid monopolizing, and should turn the emulation into the masses' own movement. The leadership is only promoting the movement and constantly introducing experience. An important part of the organizational work is to grasp the emotions and put forward slogans in a timely manner to better improve. Organize mutual visits to exchange experience. The leadership should pay good attention to preventing "championshipism" and promoting new heroism. In addition, emulation cannot continue uninterruptedly. Not taking care of this point easily leads to boredom. After the emulation is over, the summary should promote democracy, and should not only listen to the opinions of a few activists. After the summary, rewards should be given and a meeting of heroes and models should be convened.
    Must Be Linked to Learning Skills and Cannot Be Confused with Completing Tasks
    (4) Establishing Merit and Mutual Aid Groups. Establishing merit itself is also a form of revolutionary emulation. To further improve this movement, the following issues must be resolved: 1. Link establishing merit with learning skills, and emphasize that every soldier and cadre should learn skills well in their own positions in order to establish merit well. 2. Link establishing merit with completing tasks, and establish special merit under the completion of the overall task, and cannot be confused with completing tasks. 3. Link cultivating typical examples with cultivating cadres, and pay attention to making many typical examples become cadre reserves in cultivating typical examples. The mutual aid group is the most basic organizational form of the mass line. It is not an administrative or party organization. Under the leadership of the squad leader, it can make the leadership's intentions become a mass movement through the mutual aid group, which is more suitable for leading new soldiers and liberated soldiers, so that the three types of people in the mutual aid group can educate each other. To make the merit-establishment movement and the mutual aid group more consolidated and improved, the leadership of the party must be strengthened, and party members must play an active exemplary role among the masses.
    More Praise and Less Criticism
    (5) Cultivate typical examples, and timely praise and reward. The policy of praise and reward should be clarified in the minds of every cadre, and it should also be determined that praise and reward should be the main focus, and its spirit is to promote the positive aspects and overcome the negative aspects. This method is also the most effective way to promote the progress of backward elements. Too much criticism of the backward does not achieve the purpose of transformation. Praise and reward should be included in the files, and the view of some cadres that "punishment is specific and praise and reward are abstract" in the past should be changed. Cultivating typical examples is a good way to improve everyone with the banner of models. Cultivating typical examples should also follow the mass line; models that have been approved by the masses are not easy to collapse. Cultivating individual typical examples should be linked to unit typical examples; cultivating individual typical examples should, in a sense, lay the foundation and prepare for cultivating unit typical examples. The promotion role played by unit typical examples is often greater.
    Humbly Listen to the Opinions of the Masses and Promote the Enthusiasm of the Masses
    (6) The issue of promoting democracy. Promoting democracy is the guarantee for realizing the mass line, which is consistent with the highly disciplined and centralized army-building principles of our army. Precisely because our army is the people's army, leading cadres should believe in the wisdom and ability of the people. The ability of leaders alone is far from enough, and the wisdom and ability of the masses must be concentrated and expanded. Therefore, there must be appropriate democracy in the troops to inspire the enthusiasm of the masses, and the concentration of orders must be built on the basis of a certain degree of democratic consciousness. In this way, the troops can be more united. The key to promoting democracy lies in cadres humbly listening to the opinions of the masses.

### 太行军区部队虚心学习  执行群众路线成绩显著

    太行军区部队虚心学习
    执行群众路线成绩显著
    【本报特讯】自中央局指出六纵执行群众路线的成就是人民军队建军的新方向后，太行军区部队即起而响应学习；日前该区团以上干部学习会上，副政委黄镇同志，又专门将太行部队虚心学习六纵群众路线和古田会议的经验，作了一次发言。他说：太行部队在学习六纵经验中，已获得初步成绩。首先，在干部思想上由不明确或不很明确而逐渐明确起来了，且从实际工作中学会运用群众路线的工作方法。其次，部队中已普遍建立起群众路线的基本组织——互助组；发动了比较热烈的立功运动。群众的积极性创造性遂充分得到了发扬。部队工作中的群众纪律，新战士的教育巩固，以及争取俘虏等工作都立刻收到很大的成绩。特别是在练兵中，收效更为显著。如××部在学习群众路线中，领导上深入抓住了典型取得经验，使练兵造成了热潮，春季练兵任务可以缩短在十天内完成。××部在执行群众路线的工作方法时，很好运用了群英会，加强了干部和战士的思想教育，启发了群众的积极性，提高了部队政治工作的效率。××部在学习执行群众路线中，大力开展了立功运动，并及时总结了经验，集中起来又坚持下去，收到很大成绩，并对其他单位也起了很大的示范作用。
    接着，黄副政委具体介绍了太行部队在完成一个任务或一件工作时，具体运用群众路线方法的经验：
    首长负责亲自动手启发群众思想自觉
    （一）在布置一件工作任务时，必须实现首长负责亲自动手。如何负责？怎样动手？以首长为中心，一个时期一个中心工作，辅之以第二第三位工作，各部门配合一致，首长与领导骨干要深入到下边去，与广大群众相结合，了解群众情绪，听取意见，使自己决定更加正确，然后进行酝酿，培养正确舆论和群众热烈的情绪，再进行深入动员，提出一般号召和具体办法，再发动群众讨论。领导提的工作任务与办法，群众懂得了，思想有了准备，加上领导骨干积极分子与领导人员的带头模范作用，群众运动就搞起来了。首长深入下层，亲自帮助一两个单位取得经验作为指导，发现缺点很快改正，这样才会使运动不致中断，任务不致落空。
    （二）进行普遍深入的政治动员，思想教育，启发群众的思想自觉。怎样进行思想动员？一个任务下来以后，首先普遍进行思想酝酿，来贯通大家的思想；在正确思想树立的基础上，启发每个同志的自觉，领导的思想和情绪，也就自然的变为群众的思想情绪和行动。热烈的群众运动很快就掀动起来。怎样进行思想酝酿？一个任务确定后，干部先进行调查研究，了解群众情绪，针对各种思想，实际进行教育，召开一些很有作用的会议，动员正确舆论，使英雄模范起很好的带头桥梁作用。经过老战士、新战士、解放战士互相教育，并掌握报纸及其他动员方式，帮助积极分子提出自己努力的目标及完成任务的办法。（积极分子订计划不宜过高，否则会影响大家的情绪。领导上订计划亦应根据大多数人的水准提出来，否则即脱会离群众和落空。）对中间分子动摇不定的情绪，不要急于批评，要让他考虑，领导与积极分子应慢慢诱导他转化。落后的让其暴露，了解其情绪，不轻易批评，以免使他灰心。经过酝酿，使他积极情绪逐渐生长。动摇停止，落后减少，这就是思想成熟的标志。这时就应召集动员大会，领导上即可提出任务及完成任务的有利条件，英雄模范发言订计划、讨论，推动集体订计划，如任务比较困难，动员后信心还不够高，最好找出好的成功的例子来说明解释，以坚定大家的信心。一个任务从开始到完成，不是一二次动员就能解决问题，要根据运动的发展进行不断的动员；方式也不是定型的，可以采取大会、班排会、个别谈谈等。总之依据需要来进行。
    组织革命竞赛必须深入动员
    （三）关于组织各种革命竞赛。组织革命竞赛是发动群众积极性到最高程度的方法。这种竞赛有两种：一是较长期的；一是短期的带突击性的。条件简单，目标明确，容易将大家情绪鼓动起来。竞赛必须有深入的动员，造成热烈的竞赛空气，条件才算成熟。此外，还须有很好的组织工作，干部切忌包办，应把竞赛变成群众自己的运动。领导上只是推动运动，经常介绍经验。组织工作中很重要的是掌握情绪，适时提出口号，更好的提高。组织互相参观，交流经验。领导上要很好注意防止“锦标主义”，发扬新英雄主义。另外，竞赛也不能是不间断的继续。不照顾这点，也容易产生厌倦。竞赛结束后，总结应发扬民主，不能只听少数积极分子的意见。总结后要进行奖励，召开英模会议。
    必须与学习本领联系起来不能与完成任务混为一谈
    （四）立功与互助组。立功本身也是革命竞赛的一种形式，要把这一运动再提高一步，须解决以下几个问题：１、将立功与学习本事联系起来，应强调每个战士与干部应在自己岗位上学好本事，才能很好的立功。２、将立功与完成任务联系起来，在完成总的任务下立特殊功劳，不能与完成任务混为一谈。３、把培养典型与培养干部联系起来，在培养典型中要注意把许多典型成为干部的后备。互助组是群众路线最基本的组织形式，不是行政和党的组织，它在班长领导下，可以使领导意图通过互助组成为群众运动，更适合于带领新战士和解放战士，使互助组内的三种人互相进行教育。要使立功运动与互助组更巩固提高起来，必须加强党的领导，党员在群众中起积极的模范作用。
    多表扬少批评
    （五）培养典型，及时表扬和奖励。表扬奖励的方针，应在每个干部思想中明确起来，同时也应确定以表扬奖励为主，其精神是发扬积极方面、克服消极方面。这办法也是推动落后分子进步最有效的办法。对落后过多批评，是达不到改造目的的。表扬奖励应列入档案，把某些干部感觉过去组织上“处分是具体的，表扬奖励是抽象的”的观点转变过来。培养典型是以模范的旗帜来提高大家，深入领导的一种好办法。培养典型也应走群众路线；只有经过群众通过的模范，才不容易垮下去。培养个人典型，应与单位典型联系起来；培养个人典型，在某种意义上说来应当是为了培养单位的典型打基础、做准备。而单位典型起的推动作用往往是更大。
    虚心倾听群众意见发扬群众的积极性
    （六）发扬民主问题。发扬民主是实现群众路线的保证，这与我军高度纪律与集中的建军原则是一致的。正因为我们的军队是人民的军队，领导干部应相信人民的智慧与能力，仅是领导者的能力是非常不够的，必须将群众的智慧能力集中起来，发扬广大。因此部队里必须有适当的民主，启发群众的积极性，命令集中必须建筑在一定程度的民主自觉的基础上。这样，部队才能更加团结。而发扬民主的关键，就在于干部虚心倾听群众的意见。
