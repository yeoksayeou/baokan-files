　　Lu Southwest Guerrilla Warfare Develops Unprecedentedly
    Militia Repeatedly Annihilates Enemy Regular Army
    A Certain Unit of Over a Hundred Men Repels Two Regiments of Chiang's Army
    [Reported by our newspaper's Ji-Lu-Yu branch on the 9th] Our newspaper reporter Qi Yu reports: The anti-enemy guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines in southwestern Shandong has developed unprecedentedly and has gained rich combat experience. Although our main force has withdrawn south of the Yellow River and Chiang's army has occupied some empty cities, more than 70% of the rural areas are still controlled by the people. Chiang's army's transportation and communication lines are often cut off by the elusive guerrilla forces. From early February to mid-March alone, the guerrilla teams fought more than 20 times, killing, wounding, and capturing more than 700 officers and soldiers of Chiang's army, and seizing 46 Chiang's army vehicles on highways such as He(ze)-Ji(cheng) and Jin(xiang)-Ji(ning). The enemy's "mopping-up" and "suppression" operations against Heze, Kaocheng, Cao County and other places have also been smashed by the military and civilians behind enemy lines. In the past, they mainly fought the "Returning Home Corps," but now their targets have shifted to fighting miscellaneous troops and Chiang's regular army. Why has the anti-enemy guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines gained unprecedented development? According to the reporter's personal experience: the main reason is that land reform has been carried out persistently in various places behind enemy lines amidst the artillery fire, and the vast number of peasants have obtained land. In order to defend their own interests of liberation, they have actively participated in the local armed forces and fought against the enemy and puppets. When the × County Brigade was established, it only had 27 people, but it developed to more than 500 people within a month. They fought to defend their own land, and therefore showed particular determination and bravery. The × District Squad was completely equipped with Chiang's army's weapons. The liberated masses are also very active in participating in the war. In February, after our guerrilla forces recovered Chengwu City, the whole county was mobilized, and the city walls were completely destroyed within four days. Secondly, after several months of serious combat tests, local cadres have gained experience in persisting in the struggle, and their courage and confidence have been enhanced. In the occupied areas, it has become common practice for district cadres not to leave the district, county cadres not to leave the county, and commissioners not to leave the special district. The phenomenon of individual county cadres transferring last year no longer exists this year. Due to the above reasons, a close combination of the armed forces behind enemy lines and the broad masses of the people has been created, forming a powerful force for fighting against the enemy.
    [Reported by our newspaper's Ji-Lu-Yu branch on the 8th] (Late dispatch) A certain guerrilla team behind enemy lines of over a hundred men repelled two regiments of Chiang's army. On the 19th of last month, ten thousand Chiang's troops from Yuncheng, Juye, Wenshang and other places, divided into five routes, committed harassment in the Nanwang area east of Yuncheng, occupying three villages. The local guerrilla troops rose up to meet them. The × team had only a little more than a hundred combatants, and was attacked by two regiments of the enemy. The unit used a platoon of soldiers to charge fiercely towards the village of Zhengdong, and the enemy panicked and fled in defeat.

　　鲁西南游击战争空前发展
    民兵屡歼敌正规军
    某部百余人击退蒋军两个团
    【本报冀鲁豫九日电】本报记者齐语报导：鲁西南敌后游击战争空前发展，已获得丰富的斗争经验。虽然我主力撤离黄河以南，蒋军侵占了一些空城，但百分之七十以上农村，仍控制在人民手里。蒋军的交通联络补偿线，经常于出没无常的游击武装所截断。仅二月上旬至三月中旬，游击队作战即达二十余次，毙伤俘蒋军官兵七百余名，在荷（泽）羁（城）及金（乡）济（宁）等公路上，缴获蒋军汽车四十六辆。敌对荷泽、考城、曹县等地进行“扫荡”“清剿”，亦均为敌后军民所粉碎。过去他们著打“还乡团”，现在的目标都转向打杂牌军和蒋家正规军了。敌后游击战争为什么获得空前发展呢？据记者亲自体验：主要原因因为敌后各地在炮火中坚持进行了土地改革，广大农民获得土地，他们为保卫自己翻身利益，纷纷参加地方武装。和敌伪搏斗。×县大队成立时只有二十七人，但一月内即发展到五百余人，他们为保卫自己的土地而战，因之表现得特别坚决勇敢，×区干队即完全为蒋军武器装备起来。翻身群众参战亦非常积极，二月我游击武装收复城武城后，全县群众大动员，四天内就把城墙彻底平毁。其次，经过几个月严重的战斗试验，地方干部取得了坚持斗争的经验，增强了勇气和信心，沦陷区普遍作了区干不离区，县干不离县，专员不离专区。去年个别县干转移现象今年已不复再现了。由于以上原因，造成敌后武装与广大人民的密切结合，形成对敌斗争的强大力量。
    【本报冀鲁豫八日电】（迟到）敌后某游击队百余人击退蒋军两团。上月十九日郓城、巨野、汶上等地蒋军万人分五路向郓城以东，南旺地区犯扰，占领三个村庄，当地游击部队奋起迎击，×队仅有战斗员百余人，遭敌两个团的兵力夹击，该部以一排兵力向正东村庄猛冲，敌人恐慌溃窜。
