　　Production Focuses on Filling Gaps
　　Points Awarded Based on Meter Measurement
　　The New China Bookstore's management production team, in addition to recently deciding to use secondary production to fill work gaps, has implemented a new approach. Activities like grinding flour and farming invariably require significant time after dinner. However, there are smaller gaps during the day, such as after breakfast and at noon. These gaps are used for spinning cotton. The money earned from spinning goes entirely to the individual. This approach is called "filling the production gaps."
　　Some production teams have collapsed due to a lack of scientific point allocation. The management production team has adopted a point system based on the value of rice. They have determined that for every catty of production value equal to one catty of rice, one point is awarded. The price of rice is assessed monthly. However, for agricultural production where the benefits are delayed, time is currently recorded and converted into rice value when the harvest is reaped. The points are then divided based on each individual's recorded time, which is considered a relatively fair method.

### 生产注意填窟窿　记分以米作标准

　　生产注意填窟窿
  　记分以米作标准
    新华书店经理部的生产小组，除最近定了以次要生产来补工作空隙的办法。因为不论推磨、种地，总得在晚饭后很整的时间去做。可是一天中除工作外，还有早饭后及中午等一些空隙，就利用这些空隙纺花，纺花赚的钱全归私人，这办法就叫作“填生产中的窟窿”。
    有些生产小组因为没有科学的定分就垮台了，经理部生产小组采取以米作标准的记分办法。它定出：凡是你的生产价值一斤米就记一分，每月评定一次米价。但如农业生产，得利还早，那就现在记钟点，将来收了果实时再作价成米，用各个人的钟点来分除记分，这是相当公道的办法。（毛）
