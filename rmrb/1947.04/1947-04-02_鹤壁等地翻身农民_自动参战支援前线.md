　　[This Dispatch from Taihang, 31st] In February and March, our army in northern Henan launched offensives against the Chiang Kai-shek/puppet troops in Tangyin Hebi, Yuecun in Huixian County, and Jinzhang. The peasants in these two areas who had gained land actively supported the front lines. When our assault troops advanced to the outskirts of Hebi, it happened to be the Lantern Festival. The masses in one district saw the troops fully loaded with supplies and artillery rushing to Hebi, and the entire population rose up to voluntarily join the war. That day, the front needed electric poles, and in half a day, the villages delivered more than 290 poles. More than 450 women and children from Shangwu Village transported more than 45,000 kilograms of grain to the front lines at night. Zhanggongyuan Village, newly liberated on New Year's Day, in addition to the young and middle-aged people joining the war, the elderly and women stayed up all night to build "aid stations" to receive the wounded; Wang Tingxi alone chopped more than 80,000 kilograms of firewood for the "aid stations". In the battle to capture Yuecun and Jinzhang in Huixian County on the 4th of this month, the people of northern Huixian showed even more love for the wounded. When the sound of our army's artillery rang out, Ren Laosan's wife in Nancun prepared small spoons and bowls for feeding the wounded soldiers and did not sleep all night. When the wounded soldiers were transferred to Nancun, it was already midnight, and Sun Lanying, chairman of the women's association, immediately gathered all the women in the village, who comforted the wounded soldiers with eggs and fine noodles. That night, most of the wounded soldiers stayed in the village, and Zhao Fengying, a member of the women's association, took care of them all night.
    [This Dispatch from Taihang, 31st] Peasants who have gained land in Anshangbian Village in Xiuwu County, actively support the front lines. Niu Zhangcheng, a peasant who gained land, quickly completed his task of transporting public grain and received a reward. In the March support for the front lines, he sacrificed sleep and chopped 193 kilograms of firewood in one night, and a total of 641 kilograms in two days, personally delivering it to the front lines. Under the influence of his exemplary actions, the masses of the whole Bian village put forward competitions with each other, and immediately set off a "Learn from Niu Zhangcheng Movement". Even Niu Lianchi, a 64-year-old man, and Tian Yun, a 14-year-old child, joined the upsurge. The whole village ground 4,000 kilograms of wheat and 6,000 kilograms of corn in one day and night, grinding it very finely; they chopped 60,000 kilograms of firewood in one and a half days and delivered it to the designated location. The women's group also completed military shoes in seven days. In the summary, Huoshang Village had exceeded the task, and only Chai'an had exceeded 10,000 kilograms.
