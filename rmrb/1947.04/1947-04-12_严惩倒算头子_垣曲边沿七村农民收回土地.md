　　Severely Punish Counter-Settlement Leaders
    Farmers in Seven Villages Bordering Yuanqu Reclaim Land
    [This newspaper, Taiyue, 10th dispatch] After more than twenty days of armed struggle to distribute land, the seven bordering villages of Dengji, Xiajing, Baishui, and Huicun in Yuanqu County have initially completed land reform. According to statistics from six villages, 960 households, comprising 4,098 men and women, have obtained 942 mu of land, 449 rooms of cave dwellings, 80 head of draught animals, as well as cash and grain. All 72 extremely poor households have been eliminated, 90 percent of poor peasants have risen in status, and most middle peasants have obtained gains. This campaign was organized under the unified leadership of the county command headquarters, forming turnaround teams, with each village being equipped with strong backbone cadres, and organizing village-to-village joint defense. They started by striking at counter-settlement elements, and proactively attacking the enemy, suppressing reactionary arrogance, and strengthening the masses' fighting spirit and determination. The masses of Baishui Village first captured special agent Cheng Peishao and others, giving them severe punishment. Farmer Cheng Shizhong held a hand grenade tightly and said to the special agent: "Either you die or I die, there is no place for both of us." As a result, many small "counter-settlement" elements had to bow their heads to the masses and return the land that had been "counter-settled" back.

　　严惩倒算头子
    垣曲边沿七村农民收回土地
    【本报太岳十日电】垣曲登圾、硖景、白水、回村等七个边沿村，经二十余日武装分田斗争，初步完成了土地改革。据六个村统计九百六十户，男女四千零九十八口人，获得土地九百四十二亩，房窑四百四十九间，耕畜八十头及现款、粮食等，赤贫七十二户全部消灭，贫农百分之九十上升，中农大部得到果实。此次运动是在县指挥部统一领导下组织翻身队，各村都配以坚强的骨干干部，组织村村联防。劈头便打击倒算分子，并主动的袭击敌人，镇压了反动气焰，增强了群众的斗志与决心，白洒村群众首先捕获了特务成培绍等，给以严重处分，农民成士中紧紧握着手榴弹向特务说：“有你没有我，有我就没有你了”。于是许多小的“倒算”分子不得不向群众低头，退回“倒算”去的土地。
