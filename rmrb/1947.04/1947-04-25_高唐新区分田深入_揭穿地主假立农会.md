    When the eastern part of the first district of Gaotang was liberated and preparations were being made to mobilize the masses, it was discovered that landlords in seven or eight villages were buying off and enticing poor peasants to deceive them into joining fake farmers' associations. Thirty-eight peasant households in Dayang Village were deceived into joining, and forty households in Eryang Village joined. There were farmers' associations in every village, making it difficult to distinguish between genuine and fake ones, and cadres felt confused and unable to intervene. In this situation, the leadership put forward the slogan "Be bold and don't be afraid to act, go further in depth, discover the truth, and transform fake farmers' associations into real ones by discovering activists from deep within." All comrades went deep into the situation together, and in five or six days, the situation had been initially opened up. The fake farmers' associations had been exposed by the masses, and the real farmers' associations were being connected from small to large. For example, Dayang Village has developed sixteen farmers' association members, elected its own director, and liquidated a traitor's property. Eryang Village has discovered three activists and is connecting them to develop members. The organization committee member of the Shili Village farmers' association was drawn over by the landlord and wavered, but has now awakened. The landlord in Jiang Village, in order to escape the struggle, was digging up trees and selling mules, but was seized by the masses. Dou Guantun and Xiao Houzhuang are organizing connections and brewing struggle. After the situation was opened up, the emotions of the cadres and the masses changed from low to high, and the masses have begun to struggle against and complain about the landlords. The raging fire of this struggle will soon spread throughout the new district.

    高唐新区分田深入
    揭穿地主假立农会
    【本报冀南二十三日电】高唐一区东部获得解放，正在准备发动群众的时候，发现七、八个村子的地主收买利诱贫苦群众，欺骗他们参加假农会。大杨庄三十八户农民被骗参加，二杨庄四十户参加。村村有农会，真假难分，干部感觉乱无头绪，工作没法插手。在这种情况下，领导上即提出了“大胆去干不要怕，进一步的深入，发现真假，从深入发现积极分子中变假农会为真农会”的口号。全体同志一致深入下去，五、六天的时间，局面已初步打开，假农会已为群众识破，真的农会由小而大的串连起来。如大杨庄已发展了十六个农会员，选了自己的主任，并清算了一家汉奸。二杨庄已发现了三个积极分子，正在串连发展会员。十里村的农会组织委员被地主拉拢，曾经动摇，现已觉悟过来。姜庄的地主为了逃避斗争，正在刨树卖骡子，被群众扣住。斗官屯、小候庄正组织串连酝酿斗争。局面打开后，干部、群众情绪由低落变为高涨，群众已开始对地主斗争、诉苦，这种斗争的烈火，不久即会燃遍全新区。
