[This report from our newspaper's Taiyue office, dated the 2nd] Militia guerrilla units along the Tongpu Railway (including Pingyao, Huoxian, Hongtong, Zhaocheng, Linfen, and Fushan counties) have been launching encirclement warfare everywhere since the beginning of March to protect land reform. Shangjiluo Village, the only stronghold of the Chiang Kai-shek army outside Zhaocheng, was forced to withdraw into the city on the 7th under the continuous encirclement and attacks by our militia. Now, except for the isolated city walls, the vast countryside of Zhaocheng is completely under our control. The militia rotation team of the Third District of Hongtong County went to the enemy area near Yuansu and Guopen, which are two and five miles away from the Lisu Fort stronghold respectively, and destroyed the eight-inch canal used by the enemy for water, making it difficult for the Chiang Kai-shek army entrenched there to get water. On the 12th, when the enemy came out to check the canal, attempting to repair it, they were wounded by cold shots and landmines from our militia, and dared not come out again. On the 12th, the Linfen militia rotation team and part of the security team attacked the Yan Xishan special armed "Love the Village Corps" that invaded Dengzhuang and Xihou, and won a victory, wounding and capturing eight enemies, and seizing one machine gun, eight rifles, and more than a thousand rounds of ammunition. After Fushan rebuilt its spider-web joint defense, the rotation team guerrilla unit of the First District operated to Jiazhuang, six miles away from the city. On the 14th, they ambushed the Chiang Kai-shek army plainclothes squad that invaded the village at the warehouse recess, and after half an hour of fierce fighting, the entire team of fourteen people was annihilated by us, and eight rifles and more than four hundred rounds of ammunition were seized. From the 1st to the 3rd of this month, the Pingyue and Goudong militias of Huoxian County continuously defeated two invasions by the Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan armies, killing and capturing thirteen enemies. On the 5th of this month, the Pingyao militia guerrilla unit attacked the enemy who robbed grain in Guoxiu, killing and wounding six enemies, and recovered seven donkeys robbed from the masses and returned them to their original owners.

[This report from our newspaper's Taiyue office, dated the 2nd] The Taiyue First Prefectural Committee recently called on all areas along the Tongpu Railway to carry out the struggle of guerrilla warfare and land reform as one. The call first pointed out the achievements and shortcomings of the past year, saying that from February to before the wheat harvest last year, there was a vigorous movement along the Tongpu Railway, with more than four-fifths of the villages involved in the struggle, and the militia had developed by one to ten times, and the enemy-killing competition in December exceeded the original plan by one time. However, later the environment turned bad, and only attention was paid to carrying out guerrilla warfare, and the land reform movement was neglected. It was thought that the masses would be mobilized after the situation improved, which also affected the fighting spirit of the peasants. The call also pointed out that the basic characteristic of the Tongpu Railway area at present is that the enemy's armed forces are combined with local despots and bullies, and they are always trying to undermine the peasant's emancipation movement. Therefore, our policy is to mobilize the entire peasant class to support guerrilla warfare in leading the peasants to emancipate themselves. All cadres in the border areas must serve two roles, both leading the fighting and leading the land distribution. Finally, the leaders in the border areas were reminded to pay attention to several issues: First, to implement boldness and resoluteness, resolutely implement the principle of the enemy advancing, we also advance, not to bow to the enemy, not to be afraid of temporary setbacks, and to share life and death with the masses in any situation. In the struggle, the target should be the big, worst enemy, and small and medium landlords should be allowed to donate land and leave a way out for life. For rich peasants without feudal exploitation, resolutely do not move them, take employed poor peasants as the backbone, and take care of middle peasants. Middle peasant activists should not be excluded. Learn from Lingshi to identify the target, deduct first and then struggle, and unify the leadership of guerrilla warfare and land reform, so that the emancipation and guerrilla warfare movement in the border areas can be combined.

　　游击战争土地改革紧密结合
    同蒲沿线民兵游击队
    主动袭敌掩护分田
    【本报太岳二日电】同蒲沿线（包括平、霍、洪、赵、临、浮各县）民兵游击队，三月初以来到处展开围困战，掩护土地改革。赵城外围之蒋军唯一据点上纪落村。在我民兵不断围困与打击下，敌人已于七日被迫撤回城内。现赵城蒋军除孤守城垣外，广大乡村完全为我控制。洪洞三区民兵轮战队到离苏堡据点二里之原苏、上下鲁五里之郭盆一带接敌区，将敌吃水的八寸渠破坏，困踞该地之蒋军吃水大感困难。十二日敌出来查渠，企图修复，遭我民兵冷枪、地雷杀伤五名后，不敢再出。临汾民兵轮战队及保安队一部于十二日袭击出犯邓庄、西侯之阎特武装“爱乡团”获胜，伤俘敌八名，缴获机枪一挺、步枪八支、子弹千余发。浮山重建蛛网联防后，一区轮战队游击队活动到离城六里之贾庄，十四日在该村之仓库凹伏击出犯之蒋军便衣小队，激战半小时，全队十四人被我歼灭，缴获步枪八支、子弹四百余发。霍县坪乐、沟东民兵本月一日至三日连续击溃蒋阎军两次进犯，毙俘敌十三名。本月五日平遥民兵游击队袭击郭休抢粮之敌，毙伤敌六名，并夺回被抢群众毛驴七头归还原主。
    【本报太岳二日电】太岳一地委顷向同蒲沿线边沿区各地号召开展游击战争与土地改革两位一体进行斗争。号召中首先指出去年一年的成绩及其缺点，谓去年二月至麦收前同蒲沿线都有过轰轰烈烈的运动，五分之四以上的村庄均卷入了斗争，民兵曾发展了一倍至十倍，十二月杀敌竞赛超过原计划一倍。但后来环境转为恶劣，仅注意了开展游击战争，忽视了土地改革运动，认为情况好转后再发动群众，因而亦影响了农民的斗争情绪。号召中并指出目前同蒲沿线的基本特点是敌人武装与当地奸霸结合起来，时时图谋破坏农民的翻身运动。因此，我们的方针便是在领导农民翻身中动员整个农民阶级支持游击战争，一切边沿区的干部都必须一身二任，既能领导打仗，又能领导分田。最后，提醒边沿区领导必须注意几个问题：首先是贯彻大胆放手，坚决实行敌进我进，不许向敌人低头，不怕暂时挫败，在任何情况下皆与群众同生死共患难。在斗争中目标对准大的、最坏的敌人，对中小地主允其献田，留出生活出路。对于没有封建剥削的富农坚决不动，以雇贫为骨干，而照顾中农，对中农积极分子不能排斥，学习灵石的认清目标，先扣后斗，统一游击战与土地改革的领导，使边沿区的翻身与游击战争运动结合起来。
