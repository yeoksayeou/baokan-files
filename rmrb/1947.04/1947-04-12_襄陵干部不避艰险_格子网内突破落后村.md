　　Xiangling Cadres Overcome Hardship
    Breaking Through Backward Villages Within the Grid Network
    [This newspaper's Taiyue dispatch, 10th] Xiangling’s Longwangmiao Village within the grid network promoted land reform through the "Bitter People's Association." This village is an administrative village composed of forty-two small mountain hamlets. Chiang's troops repeatedly swept our mountainous areas, using this place as a base. Most of the tenant farmers are refugees who fled from Shandong, Hebei, Henan and other places, living in extreme hardship. However, because they have been ravaged by Japanese invaders and Chiang-Yan troops over the years, the peasants have a strong desire for change. Few leading cadres have arrived, and the masses have not been liberated for a long time. This spring, as land reform flourished throughout the county, some tenant farmers in the village requested cadres to help them achieve liberation. The county headquarters quickly sent people to arrive and decided to use Longwangmiao as a base village. Starting on February 19th to mobilize the masses, at that time Chiang’s troops were sweeping our mountainous areas and still using Longwangmiao as a base. During the thirteen days of war, the leading comrades always persisted in the struggle and did not leave the masses for a single day. During the war life, the relationship between the cadres and the masses became close, and they talked about many sufferings in their spare time, but they all said that they dared not complain. On March 9th, a Bitter People's Association was held for the entire administrative village; 55 people attended, and their courage was enhanced through mutual inspiration. After the leading comrades reported on the strength of our army and the inevitable defeat of Chiang’s army, everyone’s emotions became even higher, but they still dared not struggle, so the meeting was stopped and individual mobilization was carried out. It was proposed that "sufferings should be completely poured out," and the government will support everyone. So Shang ×× began to complain about the abuse he suffered when he worked as a hired laborer for the landlord Wu Yongchang. At the most painful point of his complaint, he said angrily: "I will fight Wu Yongchang tomorrow, whoever dares to go, follow me." The bitter people shouted: "Go! Go! Go!" But some elderly people stared blankly at Shang ×× without saying a word. Some activists did not sleep all night. They said: "Our cannon has fired the first shot, and if we turn back to apologize to the landlord, he will not spare us. We must be resolute." In this way, the anger of those old people also increased. The next morning, the conference continued, although there was no notice, the number of bitter people attending exceeded twice as many as yesterday. People who complained one after another told of many sufferings. Even Xi ××, the most honest and silent bitter man in Wangjia Village, also bitterly complained about the landlord Wu Yongchang, saying: "I work hard from morning till night all my life, and the food I grow feeds him, but it is not as valuable as his dog. Once I passed by his door and was bitten by his dog, I shouted loudly, but the landlord scolded me, saying I was slandering his dog." After pouring out the bitter water, the bitter people held a swearing alliance to fight the landlords and bullies to the end. They unanimously proposed: "If you are afraid of wolves in front and tigers behind, you will still suffer." "No matter how deep the water is, you have to cross it." Finally, a Land Reform Committee was established to provide unified leadership. Now all forty-two small villages are universally carrying out armed land distribution.

　　襄陵干部不避艰险
    格子网内突破落后村
    【本报太岳十日电】襄陵格子网内龙王庙村以“苦人会”推动土地改革。该村系四十二座小山庄组成的一个行政村。蒋军屡次扫荡我山岳地区，均以此地为基地。佃户多系山东、河北、河南等地逃来之难民，生活极苦。但因历年遭日寇与蒋阎军之摧残，农民变天思想浓厚。领导干部也少到达，群众长期未获翻身。今春全县土地改革蓬勃发展，该村部分佃农要求干部去帮助他们翻身。县指挥部迅即派人到达，并决定以龙王庙为基点村。从二月十九日开始发动群众，当时正当蒋军扫荡我山岳地区，仍以龙王庙为基地。战争中领导同志始终坚持斗争，没有离开群众一日。在十三天的战争生活中，干部与群众关系密切了，闲谈中说出了许多痛苦，但一致表示不敢诉苦。三月九日，召开了全行政村的苦人会；到会者五十五人，在互相启发下，提高了大家的勇气。经领导同志报告我军力量与蒋军必败的情况后，大家情绪更加提高，但仍然不敢斗争，随即停止大会，转入个别动员。提出：“有苦应该倒尽”，政府给大家作主。于是尚××便诉起他给地主吴永昌当雇工时所受的虐待。诉到最苦处他激愤的说：“我明天就要去斗吴永昌，你们谁敢去都跟我来”。苦人们呼叫着：“去！去！去！”但有些年老者却呆呆的瞧着尚××一言不发。有些积极分子一夜都没有睡觉，他们说：“咱们的炮已放出第一声，再回头给地主赔情、他也不会饶了，咱们一定坚决干。”这样那些老人们动气也大了。第二天早上继续开大会，虽没有通知，而到会的苦人超过昨天的两倍。诉苦的人接二连三的诉出了许多痛苦。连王家庄最老实不吭气的苦人席××也痛诉地主吴永昌说：“我一辈子起早摸黑的劳动，种出的粮食养活他，反不如他个狗值钱。有一次我路过他门口被狗咬了，大声叫喊，地主还大骂了一顿，说咱诬赖他的狗。”苦水倒出后，苦人们便举行宣誓联盟，与地主恶霸斗争到底。一致提出：“前怕狼，后怕虎，结果还是要吃苦。”“不管水有多深也要过。”最后又成立了土地改革委员会，统一领导。现四十二个小村都普遍进行武装分田。
