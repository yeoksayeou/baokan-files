　　[Report from the Northern Henan Front by our newspaper] As the prelude to the great battle in northern Henan unfolds, emancipated peasants from all regions, in order to defend Chairman Mao and their own land, tens of thousands of stretcher-bearers, militia teams, and transportation teams have surged to the front lines. County Magistrate Qin of She County attaches great importance to war service, personally leading the militia to support the front lines with stretchers. Emancipated masses from Huguan and Changzhi traveled from afar to participate in the war, maintaining high morale despite marching continuously for five days. Students from Zhangbin Middle School, Northern Henan Middle School, and the Normal Schools of She County, Lin County, and Wu'an have also excitedly and tensely rushed to participate in war service. Some joined transportation teams and stretcher-bearer teams, some helped the participating masses prepare for food and lodging, some participated in receiving wounded soldiers at the wounded soldier transfer stations, and some formed propaganda teams to conduct propaganda work at the front lines and in newly recovered areas. After marching for days, they immediately began working upon arriving at their posts, fully demonstrating the industrious characteristics of the children of peasants. Recently, the logistics command station announced standards for awarding merits to militiamen, self-defense forces, and cadres at all levels participating in the war. Stretcher-bearer teams, transportation teams, militia teams from various counties, and personnel from various departments participating in the war all launched discussions, brewing to earn merits. Although the Changzhi transportation brigade marched continuously for five days, they discussed how to earn merits immediately after arriving at a certain station, and set off for the front lines to transport supplies the next day. The propaganda team formed by students from Northern Henan Middle School, and the communication group of "War Participation Express," have all set their own standards for earning merits. In the midst of the intense war participation work, a hot and lively merit-earning movement is about to unfold. (Zhu Yueting)

　　[Report from Taihang by our newspaper] All teachers and students of Zhangbin Middle School unanimously want to go to the front to participate in the war. The first and second classes of the pre-teacher program and the first and second classes of junior high school have already rushed to the front on April 4th. The remaining four classes are awaiting orders at the school. They proposed that life should be militarized, and everyone's enthusiasm is very high. In order to ensure the successful completion of tasks, the students called on everyone to launch a merit-earning movement, and proposed competitions between individuals, groups, and classes. Everyone said, "This is a large-scale learning unit for participating in the war." (Feng Wenhe, Huang Zi'an)
