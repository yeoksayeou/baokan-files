　　Coordinating Mass Movements with Integrated Family Production
    Shicheng No. 2 Elementary School Praised by All
    Hao Hairu
    The following are some experiences from Shicheng No. 2 Elementary School in Pingshun regarding how they coordinated with central work, integrated family production, and resolved the difficulties of poor students in obtaining clothing and stationery:
    (1) How to Coordinate with Mass Movements: After the autumn harvest last year, the masses were preparing to settle accounts with the landlords. Some landlords, knowing they were targets of the mass struggle, secretly instructed their children to bring good clothes, bedding, silver dollars, and jewelry to the school when they returned after the autumn harvest, and to hide them. After learning about this, Principal Kang Yingqing did not directly pursue the students hiding the materials. Instead, he first conducted ideological education, leading the students in a collective discussion on "Should landlords hand over all their assets to compensate for the blood and sweat of the peasants?" After two days of discussion, the conclusion was that they should be returned to the peasants. After their thinking was straightened out, students Chang Chunsheng and Guo Jianshun voluntarily reported the things their families had asked them to bring to the school, willing to send them back home to pay off the debts owed to the masses. However, they feared that the villagers would think they were hiding more than they reported, leading to trouble. In addition to guaranteeing that the villagers would not pursue the matter further, the leadership also gave these students honorary rewards. Other students, seeing that students hiding materials were not only not criticized but also praised by the school, then Wang Ren'an, Chang Yaorong, and five others successively handed over all the materials they had brought to the school and hidden. The school immediately prepared letters and sent the hidden items back to the village offices where the students lived. At the same time, they mobilized students from families with problems to go home and persuade their parents to contribute land, clothing, etc. The school gained the trust of the villages, and the students were also loved by the villagers.
    (2) Integrating Production with Families: Many villages near the school residence (Shicheng) have a lot of peppercorns. In previous years, every time it was time to pick the peppercorns, students would ask for leave to go home, missing school for half a month to twenty days. Students from families without many peppercorns or without peppercorns at all also couldn't attend classes. Last year, when it was time to pick the peppercorns, the school felt that not allowing students to ask for leave to go home to pick the peppercorns would not only make the parents dissatisfied with the school but also would be inconsistent with the principle of integrating family production. But letting them go back would affect the classes of students who had no peppercorns to pick. So, they came up with a method of adjustment: based on the amount of peppercorns each student's family had and the time required, they made precise calculations. Students with peppercorns brought several students from families without peppercorns back to help. In addition to the students with peppercorns providing meals for the students helping them, they also gave them some peppercorns as compensation. They also combined this with the self-study tasks given to them by the school in the morning and evening. In villages with many students, a teacher was also sent to help the students with their studies in the morning and evening. In this way, in less than a week, the peppercorns of each student's family were picked, and they were able to return to school to attend classes immediately. Parents felt that it wasn't worth it to spend money to hire people, and their own children bringing classmates back to help not only didn't delay family production but also allowed them to combine it with learning in the morning and evening. They praised in unison, "The schools under the leadership of Chairman Mao are much better than the old society, where you couldn't do anything when you went to school."
    (3) Taking Advantage of Spare Time to Exchange Cotton for Money to Solve the Difficulties of Poor Students: During the autumn holiday, some students and individual teachers had small land holdings at home and did not need to return home for the autumn harvest. At this time, most rural women were busy with the autumn harvest and did not have time to go to the market to exchange cloth for cotton. The school took this opportunity to organize the teachers and students who remained in the school to buy cotton and go to small villages in the mountains to exchange it for cloth, always giving two or three liang more cotton per jin of cloth than other cooperatives. They transported the exchanged cloth to places where the textile industry was underdeveloped and sold it, then bought cotton to exchange for cloth again. This went on for the entire autumn, solving the difficulties of poor students in obtaining clothing and stationery and saving rural women a lot of effort in going to market to exchange cotton.

　　配合群运结合家庭生产
    石城二完小人人称赞
    郝海如
    平顺石城第二完小配合中心工作，结合家庭生产，解决贫寒学生衣服、文具困难的几点经验：
    （一）如何配合群运：在去年秋收后，群众酝酿清算地主，有些地主知自己是群众斗争对象，在他子弟秋毕来校时，就秘密着他的子弟将好些衣服和被褥现洋首饰带到学校，隐蔽起来。校长康应清同志知道这事后，不直接向隐藏物资的学生往出追东西，先进行了一番思想教育，让学生们集体讨论“地主该不该将所有资财拿出来，偿还农民的血汗”。讨论了两天，结论是应该归还农民。思想打通后，学生常春生、郭见顺就自动报出家庭托他拿来学校的东西，情愿送回家中，清偿群众债务；但是又怕村人认为隐多报少，闹出事来。领导上除保证村人不再追究外，并予这些学生以名誉奖励。其它学生见到隐藏物资的同学不但没有受批评，反而得到学校表扬，于是王仁安、常要荣等五人，接连将带来学校隐藏的物资全部拿出。学校立即备函，将隐藏东西送回各生住在地的村公所，同时又动员家庭有问题的学生，回家劝家长将土地、衣物献出。学校得到各村信仰，学生也得到村人爱护。
    （二）在生产方面与家庭结合：学校住地（石城）附近各村，花椒很多，往年每到摘椒时，学生纷纷请假回家，一误半月二十天，弄的家庭椒不多和没椒的学生也上不成课。去年在摘椒时，学校感到不让学生请假回家摘椒，不仅家长对学校不满，亦不合结合家庭生产的原则，但任其回去，又影响了没椒可摘学生的上课，就想了一个调剂办法，按学生家庭花椒多少，需时若干，精确计算了一下，有椒学生将家庭无椒学生带几个回去帮忙，除有椒学生管了帮忙学生吃饭外，还给些椒，作为报酬。早晚还要按学校给予他们的自学任务结合起来，学生多的村，还去一个教员，帮助学生早晚学习。这样一来，不到一星期，各生家庭的椒都摘完了，马上就能返校上课，家长们感到花钱用不来人，自己子弟带同学回来帮忙，既不误家庭生产，又能结合起来早晚进行学习，异口同声的称赞道：“如今毛主席领导下的学校，比旧社会一上学什么都不能干强的多了。”
    （三）乘空换花赚钱，解决贫寒生的困难：学校在放秋假时，有一部分学生和个别教员，家中种的地少，不需他回家收秋，这时候一般农家妇女，忙于收秋，不暇到集市上用布换花。学校就乘这机会，将留在校内的教员、学生组织起来，买上花到山庄小村换布，每斤布总要比其它合作社多给二三两花。他们将换下的布，运往纺织不发达的地方出售了，再买成花换布，这样进行了一秋天，解决了贫寒生衣服、文具困难，还省了农村妇女赶集换花的许多工夫。
