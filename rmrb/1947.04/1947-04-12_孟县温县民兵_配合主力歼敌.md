　　[This newspaper's Taiyue dispatch, 9th] The Meng County militia guerrilla team, since launching the merit-making campaign on the 15th of last month, had killed or captured 27 Chiang Kai-shek and puppet troops, seized 12 rifles, 2 pistols, and more than 400 rounds of ammunition, and collected more than 70 kilograms of wire by the 25th, a period of ten days. Since receiving the call from the Wu (Military) Headquarters to annihilate the enemy and make meritorious contributions, the county militia independent battalion has been actively engaged. A certain company of the independent battalion defeated Zhang Bohua's Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops who were looting grain in the Shigong area seventeen times, captured nine enemies alive, and seized seven rifles and two pistols. On the evening of the 19th, in coordination with a unit of the militia, they attacked Zhangdian Village in the first district and ambushed and killed or captured five Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops in Gudan, seizing five rifles, creating a glorious record of three victories in three days. The Sixth Militia Brigade, under the leadership of Deputy Brigade Commander Yin Zhaorui, also crossed the Mang River on the evenings of the 20th and 25th, marched 30 li, and raided Zhaohe and Lei Geta, capturing nine Chiang Kai-shek puppets. Another unit of the militia operated on the Qinmeng Highway and collected more than 70 kilograms of wire.
    [This newspaper's Wen County dispatch] Since the Central Bureau issued instructions to launch guerrilla warfare in the rear of the Chiang army to protect the interests of the masses, the Wen County leadership has led the families of military personnel to advance into the enemy's rear. For the past two weeks, a military work team has been attacking day and night, actively cooperating with the main forces. The puppet regime in the Qinnan area (formerly belonging to Wuzhi County) is now in shock. Various "Bao Gong Offices" (Public Security Offices) and "Self-Defense Regiments" are running around day and night along with the township offices, daring not to stay fixed in one place, fearing sudden attacks and annihilation by our army. The local despots in the villages are terrified, some fleeing across the Yellow River, some hiding in place, lowering their heads to seek a way out with the masses. Most villages have stopped "settling accounts" and have returned the fruits to the masses. During this activity, the burden of corvee labor and material contributions to the enemy by the masses has been reduced and stopped, and our regime has been established in fifteen villages. At the same time, one regular enemy soldier (from the 530th Regiment), one policeman, five "Self-Defense Regiment" leaders and below, and five local despots were captured alive, two regular enemy soldiers were killed or wounded, and six rifles were obtained.

    配合主力歼敌
    【本报太岳九日电】孟县民兵游击队，自上月十五开展立功运动以来，到二十五号止，十天中毙俘蒋伪军二十七名，缴获步枪十二支，手枪两支，子弹四百余发，收到电线七十余斤。该县民兵独立营自接到武总歼敌立功号召后，便积极活动起来。独立营某连于十宫一带十七次击溃将伪张伯华抢粮部队，活捉敌九名，缴获步枪七支，手枪两支。又于十九日晚，配合民兵一部，出击一区张店村，在谷旦伏击毙俘蒋伪军五名，缴获步枪五支，创三天三捷光辉战绩。民兵六大队，在大队副尹兆瑞同志领导下，亦于二十、二十五两日晚越过蟒河，行军三十里，奔袭赵和与雷圪塔，捉获蒋伪九名。另一部民兵活动于沁孟公路上，收割电线七十余斤。
    【本报温县讯】自中央局发出到蒋军后方开展游击战争保卫群众利益的指示后，温县领导上即率领军属挺进敌后，两旬以来一武工队日夜出击，配合主力积极活动，现沁南地区（原武陟属）顽伪震惊，各“保公所”及“自卫团”随着乡公所日夜奔跳，不敢固定于一地，唯恐我军突袭和歼灭。村中恶霸丧胆失魄，有的逃过黄河，有的就地隐蔽，向群众低头寻求后路。大部分村停止了“倒算”退还了群众果实。在这个活动当中，减轻和停止了群众对敌差役物质的负担，十五个村已建立起我们的政权。同时，活捉敌正规军（五三○团）一名，警察一名，“自卫团”团长以下五名，恶霸五名，毙伤敌正规军二名，得步枪六支。（成家留、苗润生）
