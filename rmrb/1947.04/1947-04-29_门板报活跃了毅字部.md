　　In the Perseverance Unit, you can see blackboard newspapers put out by the soldiers everywhere. The role that blackboard newspapers play in the unit is unexpectedly large.

　　When the Shandong Victory News was frequently broadcast over the phone, the telephonist of the Special Task Company was the first to hear the news. He immediately wrote the news in red pen on the blackboard newspaper, and all the comrades of the Special Task Company were so excited that they applauded.

　　The role of blackboard newspapers is not only to spread news and encourage morale, but more importantly to discover advantages, promote righteousness, and drive work forward.

　　When the Jilu Yu West Line Campaign began, the Perseverance Unit launched a marching competition. The communications squad of the Third Battalion Headquarters and another squad issued a challenge. Wei Desheng of Lu Yushan's squad had eight blisters on one foot, but he still refused to ride in a cart. Later, the blisters on his feet were rubbed into more blisters. In order to win the challenge for the whole squad, he still refused to ride in a cart. He said: "I can't ride in a cart even if I break my legs! I can't let the squad lose face." There was another soldier in Lu Yushan's squad who had two nicknames, one was "Firecracker," which everyone in the whole regiment knew, and the other was "Rubber Face." The two sentences he often said were: "Dangling around doesn't stop you from getting good food; being capable and efficient doesn't stop you from being watched." He was usually a mischievous king, but he was very brave in battle. That day he had two small blisters the size of beans on his feet, and he rode in a cart. This time the whole squad was defeated. In the evening, the blackboard newspaper was posted. Wei Desheng naturally received praise, but there was also a small cartoon, depicting a small donkey pulling a large cart, with a soldier sitting on it, with the words: "I am Firecracker, I like to ride in a cart." When "Firecracker" saw the blackboard newspaper, his rubber face couldn't help but turn red. The next day he didn't ride in a cart anymore. The blackboard newspaper immediately praised him. The third day was the Battle of Laotian'an, he went back and forth through enemy fire a dozen times to deliver messages, and when he came back, he carried a wounded soldier. The blackboard newspaper repeatedly praised his good deeds, and now he has become an activist in the squad.

　　"Three Mouths" in the Reconnaissance Communications Company is a cavalry messenger. He is the ancestor of saying strange things. Ordinary people dare not ask him to deliver messages. Not only will he not let others ride his little red horse, but he won't even let them touch it! When he's unhappy, he covers his head with a quilt and sleeps! When you criticize him, he's very eloquent. If you put him in confinement, he says: "Confinement is good! No need to deliver messages, just rest." He is an old soldier of seven or eight years, and the cadres and soldiers are too embarrassed to do anything to him. One day he said to the instructor: "Instructor! When will I get my name in the newspaper!" The instructor told him that as long as he worked hard, he could get his name in the newspaper. That day during the march, he gave his horse to a sick soldier, and the next day, soldier Xu Yunji wrote an article to praise him. The next day, he didn't ride his horse at all and carried someone else's rifle. The blackboard newspaper continued to praise him. Comrade "Three Mouths" was even happier. That day during the march, he carried two more rifles and got his name in the newspaper again. After arriving at the camp, he fetched water and swept the yard for the people. The blackboard newspaper published another article to praise him.

　　Since then, the name of "Three Mouths" has constantly appeared in the newspaper. He no longer says strange things and has been elected as the mutual aid group leader.

　　Soldiers even criticize cadres on the blackboard newspaper. Here is a cartoon by medical orderly Liu Xinmin, depicting a porter carrying a lot of things, and another person carrying a box gun and carrying nothing. The words above it are: "Porter Wang Dongzhi carries a lot of things and doesn't complain." The person below is: "You asked Comrade Wang Dongzhi to carry nineteen catties (according to regulations, a cadre can only have eleven catties of things carried by a porter), cadres should take the lead!" The next day, the cadres took down the things that exceeded the regulations. This is such an interesting and powerful cartoon!

　　Liang Qiugao, who was liberated in the Battle of Xitaiji, was originally a very good cook. After liberation, he said: "I only know how to cook millet." Later, the newspaper published an article about him, saying that he cooked millet well. He was very ashamed and went to the battalion commander and said:

　　"Battalion Commander! I was really wrong in the past, I actually know how to make five kinds of food." A Taiwanese comrade, Huang Shutai, did not eat corn buns. Later, when the squad leader cooked millet for him, he was unwilling to eat it. He stubbornly said: "I would rather starve to death in the Eighth Route Army!" He could read some words, and others asked him to help them write articles, and he was also praised in the blackboard newspaper.

　　Later, he wrote a piece and posted it on the blackboard newspaper: "The Eighth Route Army is the people's good army, I want to make revolution to the end and be a good revolutionary soldier." That day he marched more than eighty li, he didn't rest and also helped others write articles.

　　It has been less than a month since the blackboard newspaper was published, and the heroes of the Perseverance Unit have picked up their pens. One soldier, Liu Xinmin, has written fifty-eight articles. In half a month, in just one battalion, forty-eight backward elements have been transformed, and twenty-one have become activists.

　　From the blackboard newspapers of the Perseverance Unit, it can be clearly seen that the pens of the heroes are encouraging the fighting will of the heroes and are playing a huge role in the unit.

### 门板报活跃了毅字部

　　门板报活跃了毅字部
    勇进
    在毅字部队里，你随处都可看到战士们所出的门板报。门板报在部队中所起的作用，出乎意料的大。
    当山东捷音在电话上频传的时候，特务连电话员首先听到了这个消息，他马上把这消息用红笔写在门板报上，全特务连的同志都兴奋得鼓起掌来。
    门板报的作用，不仅在于传播消息，鼓励士气，更重要的是在于发现好处，发扬正气，推动工作。
    冀鲁豫西线战役开始的时候，毅字部队开展行军竞赛，三营部的通讯班和其他一个班提出了挑战，鲁玉山班的魏得胜一个脚上打了八个泡他还不坐车，后来他脚上的泡里又磨了泡，他为取得全班挑战的胜利还不坐车，他说：“把腿走断也不能坐车呀！不能为班里丢人”。鲁玉山班里另外还有个战士，他有两个浑号，一个是全团里都知道的“火力崩子”，另外还有一个浑号叫“橡皮脸”。他口里常说的两句话：“吊而浪当，挡不着吃香；精明能干，也挡不着观看”。他平时是跳皮大王，就是在战斗上很勇敢，这天行军他脚上有两个像豆颗一样的小泡他也坐了大车，这一下全班里都战败了。晚上，门板报贴出来了，魏得胜自然得到表扬，另外却也有一张小小的漫画，画着一个小驴拉着一架大车，上面坐着一个兵，上面写着：“我是火力崩子，好坐大车”。“火力力崩子”看见门板报的时候，橡皮脸上也不禁红了起来了。第二天他不再坐车了。门板报上马上就表扬了他。第三天是老田庵战斗，他一夜在敌火下来往送了十来次信，回来时又背了一个伤员。门板报一连几次表扬他的这些好处，现在他成为班中的积极分子了。
    侦通连里的“三遍嘴”，是骑兵通讯员，他是说怪话的老祖宗，一般的人是不敢叫他去送信的，他的一个小红马不说给别人骑的话啦，摸一摸也不行呀！他一不高兴就蒙上被子睡觉啦！斗争他时他的嘴巧的很，一关他禁闭他就说了：“关个禁闭多好呀！又不送信，全在休息休息”。他是个七八年的老战士，干部战士也不好意思怎着他，一天他给指导员说：“指导员！我啥时候登个报呀！”指导员告诉他只要你好好的工作就能登报，当天行军他把马让给了病号，第二天战士徐云记就写了篇稿子来表扬他。第二天他马一会也没骑还背了别人一支大枪，门板报上继续表扬了他。三遍嘴同志更加高兴了，当天行军又背了两支大枪，又登了报，到宿营地后他给老百姓打水扫院子，门板报上又登出一篇稿子来表扬他。
    此后三遍嘴的名字在报上不断的出现，他现在没有怪话了，已被选为互助组长。
    门板报上战士还批评干部呢，这里有卫生员刘新民的一幅漫画，上面是一个挑夫挑了很多很多的东西，另外一个人带盒子枪什么也没拿，上面写着几个字，是：“挑夫王东至挑的东西很多不嫌累。”下面的那个人是：“你叫王东至同志挑十九个（按规定一个干部只能有十一斤东西归挑夫同志挑），干部应当起带头作用呀”！第二天干部便把超过规定的东西拿下了，这是多么有趣味有力量的漫画呀！
    西台集战斗解放的梁秋高，他本来是个很好的伙夫，解放后他说：“我只会作小米。”后来报上登了他，说他做小米作的好，他非常惭愧的找到营长说：
    “营长！过去我真不对，我本来会做五种饭”。一个台湾同志黄树体，他不吃窝窝头，后来班长给他煮小米他也不愿吃，他顽固的说：“饿死在八路军里算球啦！”他认些字，别人叫他帮助别人写稿，也在门板报上表扬了他。
    后来他自己写了一段稿子贴在门板报上：“八路军才是人民的好队伍，我要革命到底，作个良好的革命军人”。那天行军八十多里路，他没休息还给别人写稿。
    从门板报出板到现在，还不到一月，毅字部队的英雄们拿起了自己的笔，一个战士刘新民就写了五十八篇稿子。在半月内只一个营就有四十八个落后份子被改造了，二十一个已成为积极分子。
    从毅字部队的门板报上可以鲜明的看出英雄们的笔在鼓励着英雄们的战斗意志，在部队中发挥了它的极大的作用。
