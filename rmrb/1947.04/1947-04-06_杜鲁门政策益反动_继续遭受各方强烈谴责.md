　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st—According to a United Press International dispatch from Washington on the 30th: Officials of the U.S. Army Department stated: the department will launch an active and organized movement to dismiss the department's civilian "Communists." Since Truman delivered his reactionary speech on so-called "aid to Greece and Turkey," the aggressive face of American imperialism's foreign expansion policy has been exposed more thoroughly, and at the same time, it has intensified its reactionary anti-communist and anti-democratic measures in domestic affairs in an attempt to save its crisis.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st—New York dispatch: A mass meeting was held here on the 25th, hosted by the American Committee for a Democratic Greece. New York City Labor Party member Connolly delivered a speech stating: The Labor Party has launched a movement in New York State to protest the Truman Plan, and urged Americans not to allow an anti-communist movement in the country, but to strive for progressive policies and defend American freedom. Finally, he called on various American groups to rise up and protest as soon as possible.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 2nd—Washington dispatch: After Truman's speech on aid to Turkey and Greece was delivered, it was criticized by all sides, so that when the US Senate Foreign Affairs Committee recently discussed this proposal, reactionary ringleader Vandenberg could not help but put forward some so-called "restriction" methods in an attempt to ease public opinion's criticism. Vandenberg also proposed: (1) When the Greek or Turkish government representing the "majority" of the people makes a request; (2) When the Security Council or the United Nations General Assembly makes a request with a "majority" vote; (3) When the US President believes that the "aid purpose has been largely achieved," the United States will "partially or completely" stop aid to Turkey and Greece.

　　杜鲁门政策益反动
  　继续遭受各方强烈谴责
    【新华社陕北一日电】据合众社华盛顿三十日电：美陆军部官员称：该部将发动一积极及有组织之运动，以黜退该部之文职“共产党”人。按自杜鲁门发表所谓“援助希土”的反动演说以后，美帝国主义对外扩张政策的侵略面目，更加暴露无余，同时其在内政方面加紧采取反共反民主的反动措施，图以挽救其危机。
    【新华社陕北一日电】纽约讯：二十五日此间举行美国争取民主希腊委员会主持的群众大会，纽约市劳工党员坎诺利发表演说称：劳工党已在纽约州发起抗议杜鲁门计划的运动，并敦促美国人勿容许国内有反共运动，应争取进步的政策，保卫美国之自由。最后他并呼吁各种美国团体及早地起来抗议。
    【新华社陕北二日电】华盛顿讯：杜鲁门援助土希演说发表后，受到各方斥责，以致美参院外委会最近讨论此提案时，反动派头子范登堡也不能不提出一些所谓“限制”办法，以图缓和舆论之抨击。范登堡又提议为：（一）代表“大多数”人民之希腊或土耳其政府提出要求时，（二）安理会或联合国大会经“大多数”通过提出要求时，（三）美总统认为“援助目的已大部分达成”时，美国将“部分或全部”停止对土希之援助。
