(Jilu Yu Front, 7th dispatch) Our reporter Ke Gang reports: "Truth Transforms Fear into Fearlessness" has been proven by the fact that millions of Chiang Kai-shek's soldiers, liberated by General Liu Bocheng, have turned their guns and fought back bravely. More than 90 percent of Chiang's soldiers, after laying down their weapons in front of the People's Army, only took a short rest before automatically picking up the weapons they brought with them and began shooting at Chiang Kai-shek's invading army. Each of them can vividly explain the process by which "fearlessness" dispelled "fear" in their minds. First, it was the People's Army cadres and soldiers' warm love and political equality towards them; second, it was seeing the power of the people from the liberated area maps and the people's words; but the fundamental thing was that they personally saw the happy lives of the peasants in the land reform movement in the liberated areas, which made them recognize that Chiang Kai-shek was the enemy, thus generating hatred and courage. At a meeting where a liberated soldier swore to join the People's Army, Wu Xianghao touched the words "deserter" carved on his face by the Chiang army's bayonet and said angrily: "I don't want to be a soldier, if I leave my whole family will starve to death. When I was first caught by them, I deserted a few times. Finally, they caught me back, fearing that I would run away again, so they carved two words on my face. Actually, I still wanted to run away at that time. Now you are telling me to leave, but I won't. I want revenge, I want to join the Eighth Route Army and resolutely defeat Chiang Kai-shek and liberate my home. Only in this way can my family turn over and have food to eat." Niu Genfa, who laid down his weapons in Shangguan Village, was on guard on the night of February 5th when our army captured Zhecheng. A junior officer who had been liberated that day tried to escape, but he stopped him. The officer tried to bribe him with a lot of money, but he said sternly: If I let you go, I will harm you and harm myself, because if you run away, I will have one more enemy. Now I am making revolution, I don't want any more money. I used to be a soldier of Chiang Kai-shek, now I know why I must resolutely repel Chiang Kai-shek's attack."

### 真理把恐惧变成无畏　放下武器蒋军迅速站到人民方面来

　　真理把恐惧变成无畏
  　放下武器蒋军迅速站到人民方面来
    【冀鲁豫前线七日电】本报记者柯岗报导：“真理把恐惧变成无畏”，已为刘伯承将军所解放的千百万蒋军士兵调转枪口奋勇反击的事实所证明。百分之九十以上的蒋军在人民军队面前放下武器之后，只经过短促的休息便又自动拿起自己带来的武器，开始向蒋介石的进犯军射击。他们每人都能生动的说明，在自己脑子里“无畏”驱散“恐惧”的过程。那首先是人民军队干部战士对他们热诚爱护和政治上的平等，其次便是从解放区地图和人民的谈吐中看到了人民的力量；但是基本的还是由于他们亲眼看到解放区土地改革运动中农民得到的幸福生活，使他们认清了蒋介石是仇敌，因而产生了仇恨和勇敢。在一个被解放士兵宣誓参加人民军队的会上，吴相壕摸着脸上被蒋军尖刀刻成的“逃亡”二字，气愤的说：“我不愿当兵，我一走全家就要饿死。我初被他们抓住，开过几次小差，最后他们把我抓回来，怕我再跑，把我脸上刻了两字，其实那时我还是想跑的。现在你们叫我走，我也不走，我要报仇，要誓死参加八路军，坚决打败蒋介石，解放我的家。只有这样我家才能翻身有饭吃。”在上官村放下武器的牛根法，二月五日我军打下柘城的夜晚，他站岗的时候，一个当天被解放的下级军官企图逃跑，被他挡住，军官用许多钱收买他，他严正的说：我放了你就害了你，也害了我，因为你跑过去我就多一个敌人。现在我是闹革命，你有再多的钱我也不要。我从前也当过蒋介石的兵，现在我知道我为什么要坚决打退蒋介石的进攻了。”
