Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 8th. Our correspondent on the Liaodong Front reports: On the morning of the 6th, Mo Wenhua, Director of the Political Department of the Liaodong Military Region of the Democratic Allied Army, met in a certain location with Major General Zhang Xuetang, Deputy Division Commander of the Chiang Army's 89th Division, who had laid down his weapons in the recent Tonghua-Liuhe campaign in Southern Manchuria. Mr. Zhang stated, "He initially mistakenly believed rumors that our army mistreated captured Chiang army officers, so he changed into soldiers' clothing before being captured. However, after coming to our army, he personally received generous treatment and immediately voluntarily reported his true position." When the conversation turned to Chairman Mao's famous work "On Coalition Government," Mr. Zhang believed, "New Democracy is very suitable for the needs of the Chinese people, and true followers of the Three People's Principles should accept it." He said, "The small group of bureaucratic capitalists who are now manipulating the Kuomintang will never share any political power with the people." He also said, "Such a government (referring to Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorial and traitorous government) will drive China's train into America's arms." Mr. Zhang reviewed that the reason for this failure was because everyone opposed the civil war. He also recalled that when he led his troops in the Xiuwu area of Henan in the past and came into contact with General Liu Bocheng's troops, his subordinates were unwilling to fire. Mr. Zhang said, "Only in your army (referring to the Democratic Allied Army) can one experience the human love between people." In the Chiang army, there was infighting between all levels, such as after Chen Cheng became Minister of National Defense, Tang Enbo's troops were broken up into a mess. Finally, Mr. Zhang said, "I am willing to study hard in the liberated areas and do things for the people." Director Mo offered his condolences and invited him to take a group photo. Note: Mr. Zhang is forty years old this year, from Liuzhou, Hunan, a graduate of the sixth class of Whampoa Military Academy, and formerly served as Deputy Division Commander of the Chiang Army's 49th Division, among other positions.

　　蒋军副师长张学堂
    谴责蒋家反动集团
    【新华社东北八日电】本社辽东前线记者报导：六日上午，民主联军辽东军区政治部主任莫文骅，于某地接见此次南满通化、柳河间战役中放下武器的蒋军八十九师少将副师长张学堂。张氏表示：“他开始误信我军虐待被俘蒋军军官之谣言，故于被俘前换着士兵服装，但来我军后，亲自领受了优渥待遇，旋即自动报告其真实职位。”谈锋转到毛主席“论联合政府”名著时，张氏认为：“新民主主义甚合中国人民需要，真正的三民主义信徒都要接受它。”他说：“现在操纵国民党的少数官僚资本集团，决不会把一点政权分给人民。”又说：“这样的政府（指蒋介石独裁卖国政府）会把中国这个火车开到美国怀里去。”张氏检讨此次失败就是因为大家反对内战，他并追忆以往率部在河南修武一带与刘伯承将军部队接触时，部下都不愿开枪，张氏称：“只是在贵军（指民主联军）中才能体会到人与人之间的人类爱。”在蒋军中，上下各级间，都是勾心斗角，如陈诚任国防部长后，汤恩伯所部被拆散得七零八落。最后，张氏表示：“愿意在解放区好好学习，为人民做事。”莫主任当予慰勉，并邀其合影留念。按：张氏今年四十岁，湖南柳州人，黄埔六期生，曾任蒋军四十九师副师长等职。
