Conquering Jiangzhou in Thirty Minutes
    Feng Mu
    The battle to liberate Jiangzhou City began at dawn on the 7th. Our troops took only half an hour from entering the attack position to entering the city. By the time the sunlight shone throughout the city, this city, which was more than ten li in circumference, was completely occupied by the People's Liberation Army, and the remaining enemies had been wiped out. The total battle time was no more than three hours. The characteristic of this battle was the speed of the troops' actions and the surprisingly victorious attack. Before dawn on the 7th, the enemy in Jiangzhou City thought that our army was still far away on the east bank of the Fen River and could not possibly come over, so they slept soundly without any worries. Our army crossed the Fen River at lightning speed and scouted out that the enemy was indeed sound asleep. The main attacking unit slowly carried the ladders and advanced silently towards the West Gate. The troops skillfully passed through the enemy's strongholds outside the West Gate, and a detachment passed through the West Gate Street, which was about two li long, and reached 100 meters outside the West City Gate. The regiment and battalion commanders began to deploy firepower positions. On the large bunker tens of meters away from them, the enemy sentries were still proudly walking in the moonlight. At 5:01, the battle began with the explosion of two bunkers outside the city. The hidden bunker was immediately flattened, and the large bunker fought back relying on the barbed wire outside. A few minutes later, the young combat hero Chen Xiaodui rushed to the bunker alone with a bayonet, cut off the barbed wire, and the troops immediately poured into the gap. After a series of intensive explosions, the people in the bunker succumbed out of fear. At the same time, the artillery fire covering the city began to roar, and the city wall was filled with red light. The city-climbing troops, led by soldier Wang Wanrui, quickly climbed the four-zhang-high city wall. After successfully occupying the three commanding heights on the west side of the city, the troops immediately divided into three groups and advanced towards the center of the city along the central, southern, and northern routes. The enemy woke up from their dreams, and the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army were already standing in front of them. The Yan army, which was good at escaping, fled in panic towards the North Gate, but some were captured on the streets, some were shivering with fear, and some had just rushed to the North City Wall when they were met by the People's Liberation Army. Those who were lucky enough to escape out of the North Gate were also captured outside the North Gate. At dawn, the entire city was occupied by the People's Liberation Army, and the prisoners inside and outside the city were also gathered in the city. The people of Jiangzhou saw this scene for the first time in their lives and couldn't help but call it "heavenly soldiers." More than seven hundred prisoners, their faces ashen and their heads drooping, were still riding on the heads of the people yesterday, doing evil and publicizing that the Eighth Route Army was "vulnerable." Now, they used the living facts of their own experiences to educate themselves and the people of Jiangzhou, "It is Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan's army that are vulnerable."

　　卅分钟克绛州
    冯牧
    解放绛州城战斗从七日拂晓开始，我军从进入攻击阵地到入城仅半点钟。到阳光照遍全城时，此一方圆十余里的城市已完全被人民解放军占领，并已肃清残敌。总计全部战斗时间不过三小时。这一战斗的特点，是部队行动的迅速和出奇制胜的攻击。七日拂晓前，绛州城内敌人以为我军还在遥远的汾河东，不可能过来，因而高枕无忧的酣睡着。我军以神速动作抢渡汾河，侦知敌人确在熟睡中。担任主攻的某部即慢慢抬着梯子，鸦雀无声的向西关搜索前进。部队巧妙地通过西关外敌人的据点，一股穿过长约二里的西关大街，进到了西城门一百米外，团、营长开始布置火力阵地。离他们几十米达的大碉堡上，敌人哨兵仍昂然自得地在月光下散步。五点一分，战斗从城外两个碉堡的爆炸开始，暗碉立刻炸平了，大碉堡在依靠着外面的铁丝网回击着。几分钟后，年青的战斗英雄陈小堆一个人端着刺刀冲到碉堡跟前，把铁丝网斩断，部队立即涌入缺口。在一阵密集的爆炸声后，碉堡里的人由恐惧而屈服了。同一时间，掩护登城的炮火开始吼叫起来，城墙上一片红光。以战士王万瑞为首的登城部队飞快地登上了四丈高的城墙，顺利地占据了城西面三个制高点后，部队便立即分成三股，沿着中、南、北三个方面向城中央突进。敌人从梦中惊醒，解放军的战士已经站在他们面前。擅长逃跑的阎军，仓惶向北门逃窜，但有的在街上就被俘虏，有的吓得全身发抖，有的刚奔到北城墙上，迎面又碰上了解放军。有侥幸跑出北门的，同样在北门外被捕获了。天明，全城为人民解放军占领，城里城外的俘虏也都集中到城里来。绛州人民有生以来第一次看见这种景象，不禁呼为“天兵”。七百多个面如土色、垂头丧气的俘虏，昨天还骑在人民头上为非作恶，宣传八路军“不堪一击”，现在却用他们自身经历的活生生的事实教育了他们自己和绛州人民，“不堪一击的正是蒋介石和阎锡山军。”
