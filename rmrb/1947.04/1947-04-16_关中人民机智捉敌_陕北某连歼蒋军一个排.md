　　Guanzhong People Cleverly Capture the Enemy
    A Certain Company in Northern Shaanxi Annihilates a Chiang Army Platoon
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, April 13th: The people of the Guanzhong sub-district have bravely and cleverly captured Chiang's troops who were fleeing in disarray, achieving repeated successes. After the main force of four companies of the enemy was annihilated at Wutingzi, Xining a few days ago, the local masses and militia went out in all directions to capture the remaining Chiang's troops. The militia in the Fourth District alone captured 416 enemy soldiers in three days, seizing three light machine guns, one grenade launcher, fourteen rifles, and two pistols. Yang Miaolin and three other people from a certain village in that district, armed with axes, captured 21 enemy soldiers, seizing two light machine guns, seven rifles, and one grenade launcher. In another instance, 15 scattered enemy soldiers forced residents Yang Bocheng and three others to lead the way. Yang and the others led the enemy into the Ningjiapu area, where the militia was active, leading them back and forth all night. At dawn, they led them into the village, where they were all captured alive by the militia. Enemy battalion commander Liu Yanjun fled to Liu Shengfa's home in Ningjiagou with a messenger, forcing him to cook food. Liu responded resourcefully, seizing the opportunity to hug the enemy around the waist while he was eating. The enemy immediately cried out "Spare my life!" Enemy platoon deputy Wang Weiyun fled to a certain place in the Second Township, attempting to pay a local resident 270,000 Chiang currency to lead him. However, he was delivered to the township government instead. Near Pancun, a resident encountered an enemy soldier and shouted "What are you doing?" The enemy soldier panicked and replied "Stubborn," and was immediately captured. Near Pan Village, a resident encountered an enemy soldier and loudly questioned, “What are you doing?” The enemy soldier panicked and answered himself, “Stubborn,” and was immediately captured.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, April 14th: A certain company of the People's Liberation Army recently annihilated an entire platoon of the 7th Company of the 70th Regiment of the enemy's 20th Brigade, which was serving as a guard between Yanchuan and Qingjian. They captured 35 enemy soldiers, including the deputy company commander, seizing three light machine guns, three Canadian submachine guns, nineteen rifles, and 4,100 rounds of ammunition. We suffered no casualties.
