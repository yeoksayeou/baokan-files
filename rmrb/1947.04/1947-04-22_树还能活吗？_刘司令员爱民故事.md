    Can the Tree Still Live?
    A Story of Commander Liu's Love for the People
    Comrade Zhan Tongxuan, the technical secretary, returned to the garrison with a beaming smile, as if he had a great joy:
    "This time I really saw Commander Liu!"
    Everyone immediately surrounded him, their eyes focused on him. I interjected:
    "How did you see him?"
    "A few days ago, I and several comrades went to the hospital to visit the wounded soldiers. You know, we were carrying a pack animal? We came to a village—knowing it was the military region's garrison, a comrade went to ask for the location of the hospital. We tied the animal to a tree and sat on the ground to rest.
    "‘Commander Liu!’
    "I heard this small voice and quickly turned my head. Commander Liu had just walked out of a low and dilapidated door, his gentle and healthy face wearing a pair of black-rimmed glasses, and his body wearing a gray military uniform that had almost faded to white.
    "They walked straight to the tree where we tied the horse and quietly watched for about a minute. The animal was still gnawing on the bark. He opened his mouth:
    "‘Can the tree still live?’
    "A comrade with a flushed face walked over, untied the horse, and tied it between two trees. Commander Liu walked over.
    "When he stopped in front of the tree, my eyes were fixed on a patch on his pants, and my ears were listening to Commander Liu's clear teaching to us: ‘Can the tree still live?’" (Wei Ming)

    树还能活吗？
    刘司令员爱民故事
    技术书记斩同轩同志，刚回到驻地就眉开眼笑，象有了大喜事似的说：
    “这回我可真看见了刘司令员了！”
    大家马上围上来，眼光集射着他。我插口道：
    “怎么看见的呀！”
    “前几天我和几个同志到医院去慰问彩号，你知道，我们不是带着一匹牲口吗？走到一个村庄——知道这是军区驻地，一个同志去问医院地点，我们把牲口拴在树上，坐在地上休息了。
    “‘刘司令员！’
    “我听见这小小的声音，就急速的扭过头来，刘司令员刚从一家低矮而破烂的大门里走出来，温和而健康的脸上，戴着一付黑片眼镜，身上穿着已经快褪成白色的灰军服。
    “他们直走向我们拴马的树跟前，静静地注视约有一分钟光景，牲口还一直在啃着树皮，他开口了：
    “‘树还能活吗？’
    “一个涨红着脸的同志，走过去把马解开，拴在两颗树中间，刘司令员就走过去了。
    “当他停住在树跟前的时候，我的眼就停视在他裤子的一块补钉上，耳朵在聆听着刘司令员给我们的清清楚楚的教诲：“树还能吗？’”（韦明）
