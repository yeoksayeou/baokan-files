　　Don't Rip Open the Wound and Forget the Pain!
　　Since the peasants obtained land, the phenomenon of "ripping open the wound and forgetting the pain" has occurred everywhere. No matter what is done, food and drink always come first. They always say, "People in this world should prioritize eating and wearing." Who wouldn't ride a horse if they had one? When villagers get married, some village cadres not only do not prohibit waste, but instead encourage giving gifts and inviting guests. For example, Wang, a demobilized soldier and emancipated peasant from Dongwang Village, Licheng, got married in 1943 and had a child in 1945, but today he is re-inviting guests to "make up the gift," causing the guests to get drunk, break pots, and smash bowls. It is hoped that all villages will strictly prohibit this and educate people properly in terms of ideology.

　　不要揭了疮疤忘了痛！
    自从农民得到土地后，到处发生“揭了疮疤忘了痛”现象，不论办什么事，总是酒肉当先。开口就讲“人来世间吃穿当先”。谁能有马而不骑？村中群众结婚，有些村干部不但不禁止浪费，反而发动送礼请客。如黎城东旺村翻身户荣退军人王某，于四三年已结了婚，四五年有了孩子，今天又重新请客人来“补礼”，吃得客人大醉，摔锅打碗。希各村严加禁止，并在思想上好好教育。
