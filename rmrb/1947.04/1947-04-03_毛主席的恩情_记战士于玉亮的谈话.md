Chairman Mao's Kindness
    A Record of a Conversation with Soldier Yu Yuliang
    Song Naixin

    "It's a long story! In 1943, when I was twenty years old, both my parents had passed away. There was little food and clothing at home, so I went to the streets, carrying a basket all day, running around selling peanuts and cigarettes. The money I earned was only enough for thin soup and watery vegetables. Poor people suffer a lot. I was sick and couldn't work, and my uncle often argued with me, making it impossible to live at home, so I found two companions and fled to Shanxi to escape the famine. Unexpectedly, we were caught by the "Central" army in Luohe County, and I was so scared that I didn't dare to say a word. After a few days, they brought me a set of military uniform and said fiercely, "Put it on!" My goodness! That's how I became a soldier in a slipshod way. After that, I suffered endless grievances and was beaten at every turn. Last year, when Shao'erzhai was liberated, the officers in the company were very kind to us, officers and soldiers were equal, life was free, and there was no beating or scolding. I was overjoyed and thought, "I've finally made it!" So I resolved to work hard. When the troops returned from the Longhai Railway, they were only fifteen miles from my home, and I was itching to go. I had been away from home for several years and hadn't sent a message home. My family didn't know if I was alive or dead, and I didn't know what was going on at home. The more I thought about it, the more uneasy I became, so I ran to the company headquarters to ask the company commander for leave. The instructor said to me with a smile, "Our troops may not stay here, if you leave, the troops will move, where will you find them? I'll write a letter to your family and ask them to come and see you, okay?" I said, "As long as someone from my family comes, it doesn't matter if I go home or not." As the sun was setting, the instructor started writing the letter and sent someone to deliver it. It was dark when my uncle actually came! It had been several years since we had seen each other. I was so happy at the time that my heart was pounding, and I didn't know what to say? Then we talked together non-stop. My uncle said, "The world has changed for the better. When the Eighth Route Army came, the democratic government distributed four and a half mu of land to our family." Hearing this, I was so happy that I couldn't close my mouth. The next day, the company was busy weighing white flour and cooking other dishes, especially to entertain my uncle. Before leaving, my uncle repeatedly told me, "My child, work hard. Don't worry about your family. The village will definitely take good care of us if they know you are in the Eighth Route Army." I also sincerely replied, "Uncle, don't worry, I will definitely listen to you." I couldn't sleep at night, thinking that all these kindnesses were given by Chairman Mao. I must work hard to be worthy of Chairman Mao."

　　毛主席的恩情
    记战士于玉亮的谈话
    宋乃信
    “说起来话就长啦！民国三十二年我二十岁，父母亲都死啦，家里少吃没穿，我便在街头，整天提着篮，东跑西跑的卖点花生纸烟，赚的钱只够吃稀汤菜水。穷人受的气多，我有病不能劳动，我大爷常给我吵嘴，弄得家里实在没法过，我便找两个伴，往山西逃荒。不料走到洛河县被“中央”军抓住，吓的我不敢吭。过了几天，人家给拿来一套军装，凶暴地说：“给穿上！”我的天呀！就这样马马虎虎的当了兵啦。以后就是整天受不完的冤气，动不动还要挨打。去年邵耳寨被解放过来，连里官长对咱很和气，官兵平等，生活自由，不打不骂。我喜坏了，心想：“这下可熬出来啦！”于是下决心好好干。部队从陇海线回来时，离我家只十五里，我心里痒痒的。我离家好几年啦，没给家里捎个信，家里不知我的死活，我也不知道家里的情形。越想越不安，于是跑到连部向连长请假。指导员笑嘻嘻的给我说：“咱们队伍不一定在这里住，你走了，部队要行动，你到那里找去？我给你家写封信，让家里人来看看你好不好？”我说：“只要家有人来，回不回家都行。”太阳偏西，指导员写起信，派人送去。天黑，我大爷真个来了！几年啦，没见过面。当时可把我高兴死啦，心怦怦跳，又不知说啥好？接着就一起一落的谈了个痛快。大爷说：“世道变好了。八路军来，民主政府又分给咱家四亩半地。”听见这我实在高兴的合不上嘴。第二天，连里忙着秤白面，另外炒菜，特意招待俺大爷。临走时大爷再三嘱咐我：“孩呀，你好好的干吧。家里你不要结记，村里要知道你当八路军，一定会好好照顾咱。”“我也恳切的回答：“大爷，放心吧，我一定会听你的话。”晚上我简直喜得睡不着，想到这些恩情都是毛主席给的。我一定要好好干，才对得起毛主席。”
