　　Central Bureau Organ Branch
    Summarizes Spring Individual Production
    Calls on Everyone to Prevent Complacency and Continue Implementation
    [Our Newspaper] The Central Bureau Organ Branch made a summary of the spring individual production movement on the afternoon of April 10th. The summary pointed out that the first characteristic of the Central Bureau Organ since the launch of the production and frugality movement is the rapid development of the movement. In just a few days, a vigorous upsurge was set off. Many comrades responded to the call and engaged in production very actively. They delivered their tasks as soon as they had gains, and were very enthusiastic. To date, in a month and a half (from February 15th to the end of March), 92 people have handed in their tasks, and 32 have completed more than one-half of the annual plan. The Transportation Section already has three people who have delivered enough millet for the whole year, and Comrade Wang Binzhang has even exceeded the annual task. A total of 10,186 catties of millet have been handed in, and two-fifths of the annual target has been completed ahead of schedule. The second characteristic is that the development of textile production is particularly rapid, and it has increasingly become the main form of individual production in the organ. This is because it is easy to combine with the work of the organ and can be adhered to regularly; but the leadership initially paid special attention to supporting this production, established a cooperative, provided flower loans, loans, consignment sales, and agency purchases, stipulated that yarn should be purchased according to market prices and grades, good and bad alike, and was not afraid of temporary losses, which played a direct promoting role. As a result, in half a month, the number of spinning wheels increased to 33, plus one pedal spinning machine, and is still constantly increasing. The third characteristic is that family members are also involved in this movement, opening up a way for family members to produce and be self-sufficient. Li Qinzhi, a family member of the Administration Bureau, is a model of being the first to support herself with her own hands. With the effort of spinning twelve liang of yarn a day, she not only achieved complete self-sufficiency without increasing the burden on the public at all, but also established a family business. Wu Yuexian, a family member of the Transportation Section, is also worth learning from. Seeing everyone working so hard, she volunteered, set a plan, and proposed to lay the foundation in March and April, and ensure complete self-sufficiency from May. Their leading actions more vividly illustrate that production and self-sufficiency is the right direction to gradually improve the lives of family members. Secondly, the summary also pointed out four points of experience: (1) After the movement is launched, the administration must continue to provide assistance. In the initial stage, the leadership should not be afraid of temporarily losing some money. As long as the movement can be moved forward, the money lost at the beginning can be gradually recovered and compensated. (2) It is easier for comrades in the same department or with similar work natures to take the form of voluntary combination for production and mutual assistance, and it is easier to succeed; at the same time, attention should also be paid to fair calculation of work and profit sharing according to grade, otherwise it will be difficult to consolidate. (3) Production should be combined with supply and marketing. If you don't pay attention to this point, such as growing bean sprouts and grinding flour, you will often fall into overproduction, or be stockpiled for too long, and have to be sold at low prices; or the finished products will become corrupt, causing the capital to suffer losses. (4) Difficulties and problems encountered in production: for example, how to lend, purchase, and hand in tasks (such as the organ's regulations that millet is the standard, handed in quarterly, and each quarter is converted and delivered according to the supply price of millet, etc.), must be solved specifically in a timely manner, in order to continuously give play to the enthusiasm of the masses and stimulate the movement to move forward. Finally, the summary pointed out that the current production has entered a stage of in-depth consolidation, and attention should be paid to the combination of production and regular work and study. However, production is still the center of the organ branch's work in the future, calling on everyone to prevent the complacent mood of thinking that "the task is about to be completed, and you can take a rest"; it must be very clear that in order to overcome difficulties, support the front line, and welcome the light, it is necessary to continue to implement it without any relaxation, and take the movement a more universal and in-depth step. At the same time, many activists who emerged from production were commended, such as: Huo Weimin, Xu Qingyong, Hou Yushan, Wang Yi, Li Zhigan, Li Guanglu, Liu Laichun, Liu Yong, Han Xiqing, etc., calling on everyone to learn from them.

### 中央局机关支部  总结春季个人生产  号召大家防止自满继续贯彻

　　中央局机关支部
    总结春季个人生产
    号召大家防止自满继续贯彻
    【本报讯】中央局机关春季个人生产运动，于四月十日下午已由该机关支部做了总结。该总结指出：中央局机关自开展生产节约运动以来第一个特点是，运动发展的很快。不到几天，便掀起了一个轰轰烈烈的热潮。许多同志响应号召，从事生产，非常积极，一有收获，便马上交付任务，十分踊跃。迄今一个半月（自二月十五到三月底）已有九十二人交了任务，三十二人完成全年计划二分之一以上，交通科已有三人交足全年小米，王斌章同志竟超过了全年任务。现总共交米一万零一百八十六斤，全年五分之二已先期完成了。第二个特点是，纺织生产的发展格外迅速，已日益变成了机关个人生产的主要形式。这固由于它容易结合机关工作，能够经常坚持下去；但领导上一开始特别注意了对这一生产的扶持，成立了合作社，进行了贷花、贷款、代销、代购，规定了按市价分等购线，好坏兼收，不怕暂时赔钱，大力支持，起了直接的推动作用。因之，月半功夫，纺车增加到三十三辆，脚踏纺纱机一辆，并仍不断增添中。第三个特点则是家属也卷入了这一运动，给家属生产自给开辟了一条道路。管理局家属李勤芝便是首先用自己的手，养活自己的模范。她以每天纺十二两线子的努力，不但做到了完全自给，不增加公家一点负担；而且自己还建立了一笔家务。交通科家属吴月仙，也是值得学习的，她见大家这样努力，便自报奋勇，订了计划，提出三、四月份打下基础，保证五月份起全部自给。她们这种带头行动，更生动地说明了生产自给是使家属生活逐渐优裕的正确方向。其次，总结中并指出了四点经验：（一）运动搞起来以后，行政上要不断给予扶助，在开始阶段，领导上不要怕暂时赔一些钱进去，只要能把运动向前推进一步，开始赔的钱是可以逐渐收回，得到补偿的。（二）生产的变工和互助，最好是同一部门或工作性质相近的同志，采取自愿结合，容易成功；同时，还要注意公平计功，按等分红，否则也很难巩固。（三）生产要与供销结合，像生豆芽、磨面等，如果不注意这点，就往往会陷于生产过剩，或者积压太久，不得不低价出售；或者成品腐败，致本钱也遭受亏损。（四）生产中发生的困难及问题：例如怎样贷、购，怎样交任务（如该机关规定是以米为标准，分季交，每季按供给米价折合交付等等），必需及时予以具体解决，才能不断发挥群众的积极性，刺激运动往前发展。最后，总结指出：目前生产已进入深入巩固阶段，要注意生产与经常工作及学习的结合。但生产仍为今后机关支部工作的中心，号召大家防止以为“快完成任务啦，可以休息一下了”的自满情绪；要非常明确，为了克服困难，支援前线，迎接光明，必需继续贯彻，一点也不放松，把运动更加普遍深入一步。同时并表扬了许多从生产中涌现出来的积极分子。如：霍伟民、许庆用、侯玉山、王翼、李之乾、李光禄、刘来春、刘涌、韩喜清等，号召大家向他们学习。（崔玺）
