[This report from the Taiyue Bureau on the 2nd] After Jiexiu reversed the situation, it implemented the policy of "the enemy advances, we advance," and universally launched the campaign of "one hand holding a gun, the other distributing land." Longfeng Village in the Third District began distributing land on February 14th, and after twenty days, initial results have been achieved. All 71 impoverished peasants and farm laborers in the village have been allocated 250 mu of land, ten cave dwellings, and ten houses. The steps taken involved combating corruption, rectifying peasant organizations to enhance their fighting beliefs, and then transitioning further into land distribution. During land distribution, the village's temple land, public property, and the old fruits stored by the farmers' association were first distributed to the poorest peasants. However, at this time, the general masses still had many ideological concerns, fearing grain seizures, conscription, and retaliation. Not many people participated in the struggle. Apart from a few activists who dared to speak and act, most peasants adopted a "the less said, the better" attitude. However, after a period of rest and reorganization, the militia repeatedly defeated the Yan army's attacks, robberies, and conscription attempts, which strengthened the masses' fighting spirit. The intelligence network and sentry posts were also improved; as soon as the Yan army left its nest, the masses received the news, and the militia set up ambushes or minefields, preventing the enemy from entering the village. Several spies were arrested and publicly tried, suppressing all reactionary elements' activities and stabilizing morale. The general masses reflected, "Even if we don't distribute land, we have to fight the enemy; if we distribute land, we'll fight the enemy even harder! What are we afraid of!?" Therefore, after distributing the land of the landlords and despots in the village, they also demanded the allocation of land from fugitive landlords and foreign landlords. Now, the masses in the village are more actively donating money to buy guns and arm themselves, preparing for a long-term struggle against the enemy to protect their land.

[This report from the Taiyue Bureau on the 2nd] After Jiexiu opened up the situation, guerrilla warfare and land distribution in Shangchai Village were closely integrated, and the land reform movement developed. Shangchai is situated in a precarious position, surrounded by enemies on three sides, with the enemy from Qidong in Pingyao twenty li to the east, the enemy from Hongshan and Zhangliang twenty li to the west, and the enemy from Zhanglan just over ten li to the north, and is often encircled and attacked by the enemy. Last winter, in October, the enemy's offensive was fierce, driving over ninety percent of the village's population to the mountains. Every day, except for a few militiamen who carried out guerrilla warfare on the outskirts of the village, the village was deserted and uninhabited. However, it was in such a difficult and dangerous environment that the people's combat hero Zhang Sanwei emerged. He is an honest, poor peasant who is not good at speaking, but because of his unparalleled courage and responsibility to the people, he was elected as the chairman of the Armed Forces Committee. After all the villagers were evacuated, he worked tirelessly day and night to organize the militia and actively attack the enemy. First, he led the anti-spy struggle within the militia, consolidating his position, and then he convened tenants scattered in various villages and began to settle accounts and demand land from the landlords. Only seventeen households participated at that time, but after three days, the number increased to more than seventy households. The first struggle targeted three landlords, recovering twenty mu of land, which was first distributed to six landless peasant households, including Zhang Erliu. The remaining grain and clothing were allocated according to the level of wealth in the entire village; thirty-seven grain-deficient households received grain, and most middle peasants received fruits. Therefore, when the second struggle was launched, the number of participants reached one hundred and two households, and more than ten people joined the militia. Under the influence of this village, nearby villages also gradually launched struggles, overwhelming the enemy's arrogance.

　　介休坚持敌进我进
    一手拿枪一手分田
    上柴村出现战斗英雄张三伟
    【本报太岳二日电】介休扭转局面后，实行敌进我进，普遍展开一手拿枪、一手分田。三区龙凤村由二月十四日开始分田，经二十天的时间，现已收到初步成绩。全村七十一户赤贫与雇农分得二百五十亩土地、十孔窑洞、十间房子。其进行步骤是由反贪污、整顿农民组织提高斗争信念，开始进一步转入分田。分田时首先将本村的庙地公产及农会旧存果实分给最贫苦的农民。但这时一般群众的思想顾虑仍很多，怕抢粮、抓丁、倒算等，参加斗争的人仍不多。除几个积极分子敢说敢为外，一般农民多持“少说为好”的态度。不过，民兵经过一个时期的休整，几次击溃了进攻抢劫抓丁阎军，群众斗志便坚定了。情报网与岗哨群众也注意健全了；阎军一出窝，群众便得到了消息，民兵便布置冷枪或雷阵，使敌不敢进村。并逮捕了几个特务，进行了公审，镇压了一切反动分子的活动，安定了人心。一般群众反映说：“不分地也得打敌人，分了地打敌更有劲，怕什么！？”所以在分了本村地主恶霸的土地后，并要求分配逃亡地主和外籍地主的土地，现该村群众更积极捐助买枪，武装自己，准备长期与敌人斗争，保卫土地。
    【本报太岳二日电】介休打开局面后，上柴村游击战与分田紧密结合，土地改革运动得到发展。上柴是处于三面临敌，东距平遥七洞之敌二十里，西距洪山、张良之敌二十里，北距张兰敌十余里，经常被敌合围袭击。去冬十月，敌人来势疯狂，将群众赶往山上者达全村人口百分之九十以上。每日除几个民兵游击于村郊外，村内冷落无人烟。然而，就在这样的艰危环境中，出现了群众的战斗英雄张三伟。他是不善说话的老实贫农，由于无比的勇敢与对人民负责，所以被选为武委会主席；在全村群众转移之后，他不辞辛劳日夜奔波组织民兵，主动袭击敌人。首先在民兵中领导反特务斗争，巩固了自己的阵地；然后再召集分散在各个村庄的佃户，开始向地主清算要地。当时参加者仅十七户，经三天的时间后，人数增至七十余户。第一次斗争三户地主，收回二十亩土地，首先分给无地的农民张二留等六户，其余的粮食衣物按全村贫富程度划分等级进行分配；三十七户缺粮户都得到了粮食，大部的中农都分得果实。因此，在发动第二次斗争时，参加人数达一百零二户，并有十余人参加民兵。在该村影响之下，附近各村亦逐渐展开斗争，压倒了敌人的气焰。
