        I. "Let you have a taste of your own medicine!"
    On the way to this mission, upon hearing that they would be cooperating with the 304th Regiment, the artillerymen of the Fourth and Fifth Regiments said one after another, "We must fight well and win glory for our Fourth and Fifth Regiments."
    On the evening of the 4th, the regiment attacked Yezhi Village, held by the stubborn 51st Regiment, an elite regiment of the 17th Brigade. The task of the Fourth and Fifth Regiments' artillery company was to cooperate with the 304th Regiment in attacking the most vicious battalion which had been robbing the common people. The soldiers were all eager to try, saying, "Damn it, you've occupied our territory for six and a half months, attacking us countless times. Today, let you have a taste of your own medicine!"
            II. Setting up the guns in a hail of fire
    Before dawn, the troops approached the east end of the village. Under the dense hail of bullets, the artillerymen fearlessly pushed the guns to the place closest to the enemy's bunkers. The enemy's bunkers were more than three zhang high (approximately 10 meters), and even the steep earth cliffs were four zhang high. The distance between the two bunkers was fifty or sixty meters, with a wide open space in front. The bunkers were surrounded by layers of blockade, and the light and heavy machine guns on the bunkers wove a web of fire in all directions.
    The artillerymen of the Fourth and Fifth Regiments set up their guns right in the middle of this hail of fire. The first shell landed squarely on top of the bunker, and cheers erupted on the front line. The enemy machine guns frantically concentrated their fire, and sparks flew wildly in front of them, but the artillerymen seemed not to see it, firing several more shells in succession with booming sounds. The bunker exploded, and the enemy's machine guns fell silent. Amid the unanimous cheers of the infantry, a shrill charge was sounded, and the enemies rolled down from the bunkers like mice and burrowed into the outer trenches to resist stubbornly. Grenades were thrown one after another, but they could not stop the heroes of the 304th Regiment. In the blink of an eye, they had rushed to the edge of the outer trench... The enemy's first line of bunkers was thus annihilated.
    By this time, it was already broad daylight. The advance continued step by step, with the artillery of the Fourth and Fifth Regiments leading the way, signaling victory. Every bunker, after only a few shells, had its bricks and tiles scattered and a hole blown in the roof. Not a single bunker escaped the punishment of the artillery along seven or eight lines of bunkers.
    Although the enemy launched counterattacks, they were beaten back by the soldiers of the 304th Regiment. The survivors fled to their regiment's last position at the headquarters.
            III. The heroic artillerymen display their power
    The regimental headquarters was located in the Taishan Temple in Qianliren Village, to the west. The surrounding three hundred meters were all open ground, with layers of fortifications, small bunkers in front and behind, and a large bunker standing in the courtyard. The machine gun and artillery company of the regimental headquarters alone had six heavy machine guns and five artillery pieces. Concentrated here were the stubborn remnants of the three battalions of the 51st Regiment, the regiment's directly subordinate units, one battalion of the 49th Regiment, and one company of the 55th Brigade.
    Out of consideration for the unnecessary sacrifice of the stubborn army soldiers, it was decided that night to only conduct calls to persuade them to lay down their weapons peacefully. Before the calls, our artillery first blasted a hole in the large bunker to let them know that they had no defense to rely on, but the stubborn army did not wake up.
    After the calls proved ineffective, the general attack began on the 6th. Platoon Leader Chen Zhenglie (artillery hero) and Squad Leader Jiang Shengyun of the artillery first platoon displayed great power, accurately landing every shell on the enemy's bunkers. At this time, the artillery of the 301st Regiment also concentrated its fire, bombarding them together. Although the enemy also retaliated fiercely, they could not reverse their fate. In an instant, half of the bunker had collapsed. A shell exploded near the gun emplacement of our position, and Platoon Leader Chen Zhenglie was wounded, and Squad Leader Jiang Shengyun also suffered bleeding in the ears from the shock, but they did not let up their firing.
    The enemy's bunkers fell silent, and our infantry launched a charge. An enemy company commander led seventy or eighty men to surrender first, and then scattered and fled. Our infantry rushed straight into the temple courtyard. The temple courtyard was filled with dead and wounded, with fifty or sixty wounded and more than a hundred dead from artillery fire alone. The enemy regimental commander led his soldiers to desperately rush out, but in the end, they obediently laid down their weapons, and more than five hundred officers and soldiers were all taken care of. The battle, which began at dawn, ended victoriously by noon.

　　碉堡化作瓦砾
    记四五部队的炮兵在孟县自卫战中

        一、“还你一次试试！”
    这次四五部队的炮兵在出发途中，听到是和三○四部队配合作战，大家便纷纷的说：“去了一定得打好，要给咱们四五部队争光。”
    四日晚，团攻冶戍村顽五十一团，这是十七旅的精锐团，四五部队炮兵连的任务是配合三○四部打那抢劫老百姓最凶恶的一营，战士们都磨拳擦掌的说：“妈的，你们占我们地方六个半月了，进攻我们也不知多少次了，今天还你一次试试！”
            二、在火网中架起炮来
    拂晓前，部队接近了村东头，在子弹扑扑的密射下，炮兵们毫不畏怯的把炮推到离敌人碉堡最近的地方，敌人的碉堡有三丈多高，连削立的土崖就有四丈高，两碉堡相距五六十米，正面一片开阔地，碉堡周围层层封锁，碉堡上轻重机枪把四面八方织成火网。
    四五部的炮兵就在火网中架起炮来，第一发炮弹就不偏不移的落在碉堡顶上，战线上掀起了喝采声。敌人机枪着急地集中打过来，面前火星乱跳，但是炮兵们好象没有看见似的，接连着轰轰几炮，碉堡开了花，敌人的机枪哑了。在步兵们一致的喝采声中，吹起了凄厉的冲锋号，敌人象老鼠一般从碉堡上滚下来，又钻到外壕里顽抗，手榴弹接二连三的抛掷着，但挡不住三○四部队的英雄。一转眼，他们已冲到外壕边………敌人的第一线碉堡就这样溃灭了。
    这时天已大亮，接着逐步推进，四五部的炮是开路先锋，也是胜利的信号。每一座碉堡不消几发炮弹，便砖飞瓦裂开了天窗，一连七八道碉堡线，没有一个碉堡逃出了炮的惩罚。
    敌人虽然进行反扑，都被三○四部战士们打得东倒西歪，剩下的逃到他们团部的最后阵地去。
            三、大显威风的炮兵英雄
    团部在西面前里仁村的泰山庙内，周围三百米都是开阔地，层层工事，前后小碉堡，院中矗立一座大碉堡，光团部机炮连就有六挺重机枪、五门炮。集中在这里的有五十一团三个营的顽强部分，团直属队，四十九团一个营和五十五旅一个连。
    为了顾念顽军士兵无谓的牺牲，当晚决定光进行喊话，希望能做到和平的争取他们放下武器。在喊话前，我们的炮兵先照着大碉堡轰个窟窿，让他们知道已无险可守了，可是顽军并未因此觉悟。
    喊话失效以后，六日开始总攻。炮兵一排长陈正烈同志（炮兵英雄）和二班长蒋盛钧同志大显威风，把每颗炮弹准确地落在敌人碉堡上。这时，三○一部队的炮也集中过来了，一齐轰击着，敌人虽然也猛烈的还击，但已挽不回他们的厄运。顷刻之间碉堡已塌了一半边。一个炮弹在我们阵地的炮座附近炸开，排长陈正烈挂了彩，二班长蒋盛钧也震得耳内出血，但他们并不放松射击。
    敌人的碉堡哑了，我们的步兵发起了冲锋。敌人一个连长带着七八十人先投过来，接着东奔西散，我们的步兵一直冲进了大庙院。庙院内死伤枕藉，光炮弹炸伤的就有五六十个，死的有一百多。敌团长带士兵冒死冲出来，最后还是乖乖的放下武器，五百余官兵全被解决。从拂晓开始的战斗，天才交午的时候，就胜利结束了。
