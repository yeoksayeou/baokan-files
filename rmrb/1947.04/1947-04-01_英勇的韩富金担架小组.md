　　The Heroic Han Fujin Stretcher Team
    Taihang Military Commission Communication Group
    On February 4th, the Shexian County stretcher team set off for the Pinghan Line to cooperate with our army in combat. Han Fujin's stretcher team, consisting of Zhou Shui, Qi Jiexin, Zhou Youjin, and Wu Chengsuo, a 41-year-old militia member from Taocheng Mountain, also departed. They walked and chatted along the way. Zhou Shui said, "The army is fighting resolutely, and we must resolutely carry the wounded! We must never desert!" Han Fujin said, "Right! We are determined to defeat Chiang Kai-shek's army!" When they arrived at Dongzhaitou in Linxian County, they joined the Linxian stretcher team and challenged them! "We must resolutely complete the task, and no one is allowed to desert!"
    On the night of the 13th, Han Fujin's stretcher team followed our army's Regiment × to the front line of Tangyin, Nanchang Village. After breakfast at dawn, our army had already engaged the enemy. The accompanying fifteen stretchers were busy rushing to the front line to rescue the wounded, but Han Fujin's stretcher team failed to reach them three times. The other stretchers had already carried the wounded away. At this time, machine guns and cannons were firing fiercely, and bullets whizzed over everyone's heads. They were very anxious and determined to complete the task! Han Fujin pointed to a person in a yellow coat in front and said, "Look! Isn't that the regimental commander, directing the troops there? The regimental commander is not afraid of being hit by bullets, so what are we afraid of?" Just as he was speaking, they saw a wounded person in a small ditch in front, so they hurried up. The wounded person's clothes were still on fire. They put out the fire while carrying him away. At this time, the enemy's firepower was even fiercer and they were aiming at their target. Han Fujin and his team members crawled down, carrying the wounded, and crawled over five or six small earth dikes. Everyone's hands were covered with thorns, but they didn't feel the pain. While they were walking, Zhou Shui's leg was wounded, and Qi Jiexin's arm was also injured. Then, Zhou Youjin's left arm was pierced by two bullets, but everyone struggled to carry the wounded! Suddenly, Wu Chengsuo's legs were also hit by bullets. At this time, the other three could no longer carry the wounded due to excessive blood loss. Han Fujin then carried the wounded on his back. He hadn't gone far when Fujin's leg was also wounded. But he thought, "I can't lose the wounded even if I die, I must complete my task!" So he gritted his teeth, endured the pain, and continued to carry the wounded on his back! Finally, he carried the wounded off the front line!
    The enemy was still firing fiercely in front. As they approached Zhou Shui, Qi Jiexin, and others, the regimental commander gave the order: "Comrades, charge! Drive the enemy back!" In an instant, @ @ the enemy was dispersed, and our army carried down Zhou Shui and the other three. Zhou Shui said, "The army rescued us again! Our army and civilians are truly one family."
    After Han Fujin's stretcher team returned to Shexian County, the county headquarters immediately sent them to Zhangbin Hospital for treatment. County Magistrate Qin, Political Commissar Luo, Chairman of the United Relief Association Shi, and Director Feng of the Military Commission all went to visit them! The village militias and villagers also brought eggs, white flour, and other items to comfort them! Han Fujin excitedly said to everyone, "What is it to be wounded, it's not as bad as having a sore!" They also said to County Magistrate Qin, "County Magistrate! When we recover from our injuries, we must go back to participate in the war!"

　　英勇的韩富金担架小组
    太行武委会通讯小组
    二月四日，涉县××付担架开赴平汉线配合我军作战，桃城山四十一岁的老自卫队韩富金担架小组——周水的、齐介心、周有金、武成锁共五人，也出发了。他们在路上一面走着，一面谈笑，周水的说：“军队坚决打，咱要坚决抬彩号，打死也不能开小差！”韩富金说：“对！咱们有决心，把蒋介石的军队打垮！”走到林县东寨头，和林县担架队到了一起，就和林县担架队挑了战！“要坚决完成任务，谁也不准开小差！”
    十三日夜里，韩富金担架小组随我军×团开赴汤阴前线南长村，天刚明就吃过了早饭，我军已和敌人接了火。随同来的十五付担架，都忙着上到火线上抢救彩号，但韩富金的担架小组，连上去三次都没有抢上，其他的担架都抬着走了。这时机关枪、大炮打的很凶，子弹嗖嗖的从每个人的头上飞过去，他们心里很着急，一定要完成任务！韩富金指着前边披黄大衣的一个人说：“你们看！那不是团长，在那里指挥队伍，团长还不怕子弹打着他，咱怕什么？”正说中间，见前边一个小沟子里有了彩号，他们就急忙上去，彩号衣服上还燃着火，他们一面灭火，一面架上就走。这时敌人火力打的更凶，而且看准了他们的目标，韩富金和他的组员们，都爬下架着彩号走，爬了有五六个小土堰，每个人的手上都被圪针刺满了，但也不知道痛。正走中，周水的的腿上中了彩，齐介心的胳膊上也负了伤，接着周有金的左膀上一下穿了双弹，但大家还是挣扎着架着彩号走！忽然武成锁的双腿也中了子弹，这时其他三人因流血过多，再不能架彩号了。韩富金便一个人背着彩号走，走了没多远，富金腿上也挂彩了。但他想“我死也不能丢了彩号，非完成我的任务不可！”于是他咬着牙、忍着痛，照样背着彩号走！终于把彩号背下了火线！
    敌人在前边还是打的很凶。眼看着冲到了周水的、齐介心等跟前，团长下了命令：“同志们冲呀！把敌人打回去！”一霎时，＠＠拍拍把敌人冲散了，我军把周水的等四人抬下来。周水的说：“军队又抢救出我们！咱们军民真是一家人。”
    韩富金担架小组回到涉县后，县指挥部马上送他们到漳滨医院养病，秦县长、罗政委、联救会师主席、武委会冯主任都亲往去看望他们！各村民兵，老乡们也都拿着鸡蛋、白面等去慰问他们！韩富金兴奋的对大家说：“带个彩算个啥，还不顶生个疮！”他们并对秦县长说：“县长！我们伤好了，非再去参战不行！”
