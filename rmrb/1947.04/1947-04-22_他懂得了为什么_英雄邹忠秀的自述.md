    He Understood Why
    Hero Zou Zhongxiu's Autobiography
    Ke Gang
    Hero Zou Zhongxiu is a tall man with broad shoulders. Standing on the podium with his rifle slung across his back, he said in a very loud voice: "Now I understand, for twenty-four years I lived for others, how stupid! How stupid!"
    In the evening, our conversation began in my brightly lit little room, with the wind and sand of the battlefield knocking on the window.
    "What is your family background? When did you join the army?" I asked.
    "Ai! Hard to say! Ai! Hard to say..." His face flushed red, and he said "hard to say" several times in a row. He paused, then suddenly raised his voice and continued:
    I am from Yancheng County, Henan Province. For three generations, my ancestors didn't own a single piece of land. Generation after generation, we ate chaff and vegetable leaves, running around, selling short-term labor, and working as long-term laborers. When I was a child, I went to Hubei to herd cattle for others. In the twenty-eighth year of the Republic of China, I returned home covered in festering scabies, but as soon as I entered the door, the Baojia chief grabbed me and sent me to the Twelfth Army as a replacement soldier. The suffering I endured in the Central Army, needless to say, you understand that it was not a life for humans! In the Central Army, I traveled through several provinces and saw many people who, like my family, had no food to eat, and they still had no food to eat!
    Last August. That morning, the sun was already over the roof ridge. The entire city of Qi County had been occupied by the Eighth Route Army, leaving only one battalion of our Eighty-first Brigade surrounded in the South Gate.
    We were preparing to surrender our guns, but we didn't dare. The officers said that the Eighth Route Army would bury people alive after capturing them, and no one knew if it was true or false. The company commander ordered: "Immediately attack the Eighth Route Army on the Kuixing Tower, anyone who doesn't go will be beheaded!" Since we were going to die anyway, we might as well surrender our guns. Maybe the Eighth Route Army wouldn't kill us, and we could escape with our lives. After a while, the entire battalion surrendered.
    Every day we waited to be buried alive. After three days, Section Chief Gao gathered us to speak. I thought to myself: if they are going to bury us alive, they would just take us to dig the pit, why bother speaking? Who knew he said: "Don't be afraid, whoever wants to go home will be given travel expenses, whoever wants to work should work hard..." What does this mean? The Eighth Route Army has many tricks.
    Strangely, from the regimental headquarters, battalion headquarters, company headquarters to the squad, all the officers and soldiers, big and small, treated me very well. It didn't feel like an army, but like relatives and friends. After only a few days, I heard that Wang Keqin had also come from the Ping-Han Campaign, and in just half a year he became a deputy platoon leader, a hero, and was reported in the newspaper. I calculated that I had served in the Central Army for a full nine years, and I was still just a soldier. Maybe the Eighth Route Army just loves talent, let's try it!
    In the Dayang Lake battle, a bullet pierced my nose. The common people carried me to the rear hospital, treating me very well along the way. If I wanted to drink, I could drink, if I wanted to eat, I could eat. I thought to myself, the Eighth Route Army is really amazing, they have really subdued the common people.
    Just as I had changed my dressing, an old villager in his thirties came into the room. He picked up my bloody clothes, turned around and left. My wound hurt, and I gritted my teeth and shouted:
    "Old fellow, put it down! I still need it!"
    "I know, I'll have the women wash it and bring it back!"
    "Who are you?"
    "I am the chairman of the farmers' association in this village, don't worry, you rest! Comrade!"
    At dusk, he indeed brought back the clothes, washed clean. I asked him:
    "Why did you wash my clothes? Who told you to come? How much does it cost to wash one piece?" The man smiled:
    "Comrade, you must be new here, right? This is common practice, who would want money! Without the Eighth Route Army, how could we poor people have divided three acres of land?"
    "The Eighth Route Army gave you three acres of land? Did they give it to others too?"
    "Hey! It's not that the Eighth Route Army gave me three acres of land myself, it's that the Eighth Route Army advocated land reform, calling on the poor to stand up, dividing the land of the oppressive landlords among the peasants, so that everyone has at least three acres of land..."
    "Is this true?"
    "Go and ask!" He left.
    I asked dozens of former poor people, and they all have land to cultivate now, and some have more than three acres because their family members joined the Eighth Route Army, and everyone treats them favorably. I asked them if they were conscripting here. They asked me in return: "You say the Eighth Route Army treats the common people so well, if they just say a word to expand the army, would they need to 'conscript'? Think about it!" I couldn't answer. They said that in the Liberated Areas, no one knows what "conscription" means. Everyone knows that joining the Eighth Route Army is for their own good. If Chiang Kai-shek comes, everyone will have no food to eat and will have to follow him as American lackeys, and no one will be able to live a good life. As long as they call for mobilization to join the army, in one village alone, dozens of young men will automatically sign up overnight. When the district agrees who will go, the whole village, young and old, relatives and friends, even the district chief and county magistrate, will offer him wine. Before leaving, they will also drape him with red silk and flowers and put him on a horse. ...
    Alright! Now I am convinced! I immediately wanted to return to my company. I was very concerned about our company commander, platoon leader, squad leader, and all the soldiers, feeling like I had been separated from them for many years! In fact, I had only been in the hospital for five days.
    Before my wound was fully healed, I asked to return to my company. The company commander invited me to drink as soon as he saw me, asking me all sorts of questions, saying that my wound was not fully healed and that I should rest in the company headquarters for a few days first. I absolutely refused, saying that the company commander shouldn't do that, now I understand everything, and I just want to fight.
    During the Battle of Bozhou, everyone knew that machine guns couldn't be used for assault, but I hung the machine gun strap around my neck, charged sideways, and with one burst of fire, a puff of smoke rose from the northeast corner, and a group of enemies fell. Continuing the pursuit, our squad jumped into a car and captured a mountain gun.
    I was so happy! I said to myself: Soon, in a few more battles, my family will have land to cultivate too!

    他懂得了为什么
    英雄邹忠秀的自述
    柯岗
    英雄邹忠秀，高个，肩膀很宽的汉子。他大背枪站在主席台上，用着非常洪亮的嗓子说：“到现在我才明白，二十四年来我是为着别人活在世上，太蠢啦！太蠢啦！”
    晚间，我俩的谈话开始在我这有着明亮灯火的小屋，战地的大风沙敲着窗户。
    “你家境怎样？啥时候当兵的？”我问。
    “唉！很难说！唉！很难说……”即满脸通红，一连说了好几个“很难说”。住会，突然放大了嗓门往下说：
    我是河南偃城县人，祖宗三代没有一分地。辈辈吃糠咽菜，东奔西跑，卖短工，住长工。我小时就跑到湖北给人放牛。民国二十八年带着一身脓泡疥回家来，可是一进门保甲长就把我抓住，送到十二军顶了新兵。在中央军受的罪，不用说了，反正你明白那不是人过的日子！在中央军我走过好几省，看见许多和我家一样没饭吃的人，还是照样没饭吃！
    去年八月。那早晨太阳已经上了房脊，杞县城全被八路军占领了，只剩我们八十一旅的一个营被围在南关。
    准备缴枪，可是不敢，长官说八路军捉住人就活埋，谁也不知真假。连长命令：“立刻去进攻魁星楼上的八路军，谁不去，杀头！”反正是死，干脆缴枪，万一八路军不杀还能逃个活命。一会儿，全营都缴了枪。
    天天等着活埋，过了三天，高科长集合讲话，心里说：要活埋就带咱去挖坑，何必讲话？谁知他说：“不要怕，谁愿回家，发给路费，愿干就好好干……”这是啥意思，八路军的点儿真多。
    奇怪，经过团部、营部、连部到班里，所有大大小小的官长和战士都待我很好，觉着不象队伍，象是亲戚朋友。没有几天，听说王克勤也是平汉战役过来的，到现在为止也不过半年功夫，他就当了副排长，成了英雄，上了报。我算算我在中央军干了整九年，还是个兵。大概八路军就是爱才，干干试试吧！
    大杨湖战斗，子弹把我的鼻子穿透了，老百姓把我抬到后方医院，一路上招呼很好，想喝有喝，想吃有吃，我心想，八路军真厉害，真把老百姓治服了。
    刚换了药，有个三十来岁的老乡进屋来，他拿上我的血衣掉头就走，伤口痛，我咬着牙喊：
    “老乡，放下来！我还要的呀！”
    “知道，叫妇女们给洗洗就送来！”
    “你是啥人？”
    “我是这村的农会主任，放心，你歇着吧！同志！”
    黄昏，果然他把衣服洗的干干净净送来了，我问他：
    “你们为啥给我洗衣服？谁叫你来的？洗一件要多少钱？”那人笑了：
    “同志，你是刚过来的吧？这是常事，谁还要钱哩！没有八路军咱们穷人那能分下三亩地？”
    “八路军给你三亩地？给别人了没有？”
    “嘿！不是八路军给我自己三亩地，是八路军主张土地改革，叫穷人闹翻身，把压迫人的财主的地分给农民，人人至少要有三亩地……”
    “这是真的不是？”
    “你去问问吧！”他走了。
    我问过几十家从前的穷人，他们现在都有地种了，有的人还不止三亩，因为他家有人参加八路军，大家优待他。我问他们这里抓丁不抓？他们反问我：“你说八路军待老百姓这样好，要是他们说声扩兵，还用‘抓’不用？你想想！”我答不上来。他们说在解放区说来不知道啥叫“抓丁”，谁都知道参加八路军是替自己干的，老蒋来了大家没饭吃，还要跟上他当美国的洋奴，谁也过不成。只要说动员参军，就一个村来说，一夜功夫保有几十个小伙子自动报名，等到区上答应谁去的时候，全村老小，亲戚朋友，连区长县长都要给他敬酒。临走还披红带花骑上马。……
    行啦！这一下我算服啦！我马上就想回到连上去。我非常挂念我们连长，排长，班长和全班的战士们，觉得就象和他们分开好几年啦！其实我才到医院五天。
    伤没全好我就要求回到连上来，连长一见我就请我喝酒，问长问短，说我伤没全好，先在连部休息几天，我死活不愿意，我说连长可不要这样，如今啥都懂了，光想打仗。
    打亳州的时候，谁不知道机枪不能冲锋，可是我把机枪背带挂在脖子上，横着身子冲上去，一梭子弹，东北角上冒股烟，一片敌人倒下了，再追，我们班窜上了汽车，得了一门山炮。
    真高兴呵！我心里说：快啦，再有几回我家也能有地种啦！
