Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 7th: According to preliminary statistics on the Libao campaign launched by the New Fourth Army in Suzhong against Chiang Kai-shek, one battalion of the 237th Regiment of the 79th Brigade of Chiang's 49th Division, as well as more than 20 township-level Chiang "Self-Defense Corps" and "Returning Home Corps," were completely wiped out. It is estimated that over 800 Chiang soldiers, battalion commanders, and "Returning Home Corps" members were killed or captured. The army seized five heavy machine guns, thirty light machine guns, and a large quantity of other weapons and ammunition.

Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 8th: After more than ten days of arduous struggle, the military and civilians of Rudong County, Suzhong, have won the second victory against the "encirclement and suppression." In mid-March, Chiang's army used the strength of one regiment of the 49th Division and deployed two airplanes to assist in the battle, successively occupying villages such as Dongkou and Tanhekou in Chaxi. Subsequently, they launched an "encirclement and suppression" of the central area, but came up empty-handed for several days. On the 20th, the enemy coordinated their movements from seven strongholds, including Shuangdian and Dingyan, launching a sixteen-pronged small-scale combing search. The local armed forces adopted the tactic of "the enemy advances, we advance," penetrating the enemy's rear and severely attacking the local Chiang's puppet forces, and on the 20th, they recaptured the Xuejia'an stronghold. The local masses also launched an armed struggle to defend their homes and grain (the enemy seized nearly 10,000 stones of grain in Wangjiayuan alone, and conscripted three people from each Jia on the border). More than 2,000 people from two villages in Jing'an District gathered with iron forks, holding torches in the evening to stage a demonstration parade, approaching the enemy stronghold Shuangdian, posing a great threat to the enemy. The masses also vigorously destroyed roads and bunkers, not only crushing Chiang's army's "encirclement and suppression" but also compressing Chiang's occupied areas and opening up the liberated areas.

    【新华社华中八日电】苏中如（皋）东县军民，经十余天苦斗，已获第二次反“会剿”胜利。三月中旬，蒋军使用四十九师一个团的兵力，并以两架飞机助战，先后侵占＠茶西之堡洞口、滩河口等村。继向中心区“会剿”，连日扑空。二十日，敌由双甸、丁堰等七据点四面配合出动，合击范围达五个乡，以十六路小股，进行梳篦搜索。当地地方武装采取敌进我进战术，突入敌人背后，痛击土著蒋伪，于廿日再度收复薛家庵据点。当地群众亦展开武装保家保粮斗争（敌在王家园一地即抢粮近万石，边境抽了每甲三人），景安区某某两乡两千余群众，携带铁叉集会，晚间手执火把示威游行，逼近敌据点双甸，予敌以莫大威胁，群众并大力破拆公路、碉堡，不但粉碎蒋军“会剿”，更压缩蒋占区，开拓了解放区。
