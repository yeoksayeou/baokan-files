Commanders, Pens and Guns Firing Together!
　　Reading Liu Ronghou's Combat Sketches
　　Wu Xiang
　　Comrade Liu Ronghou, the artillery company commander, in this short piece of over three hundred words, succinctly, plainly, and clearly expresses the attacking spirit, miraculous techniques, and important role of our artillery in combat. The People's Liberation Army has seized countless American-made heavy weapons from the Chiang army, and its combat power has been unprecedentedly enhanced. The People's Liberation Army has established its own artillery, and the Chiang army, hiding in its hard tortoise shell, can no longer escape.
　　Comrade Liu Ronghou's work, from the very beginning, truthfully conveys the tense atmosphere of the fierce battle: "Dawn on New Year's Eve, received the task: Destroy the blockhouse outside the West Gate of Ju'ye. Comrades immediately worked nervously on fortifications, pushed cannons, aimed, fired, boom!" He is unpretentious, does not resort to superfluous adjectives, and only truthfully writes about the events he experienced. But this is by no means just a rough outline; like a painter of bold strokes, he vaguely outlines the loyal and brave gunners, sweating profusely in the dust.
　　The narration of the whole article naturally reveals the great and strong, clear-cut love and hate of the people's soldiers: "The machine gun on the blockhouse cried again, as if it had not had enough shells, we were not stingy, and generously gave it six more." "It frantically blocked the road ahead, as if it also wanted to taste the taste of artillery shells, we immediately answered its request." Our soldiers are indeed so heroic, so full of contempt and disdain for the traitorous army, that one can almost see their firm and confident smiles when firing the guns.
　　It is not surprising that Company Commander Liu Ronghou wrote such great feelings, because this is his true feeling. He has bled for the people three times, each time insisting on commanding the position, not leaving the firing line, and was therefore elected as a combat hero and received a commendation from the Party Committee of the Column. In the Juan'nan campaign, his right arm was injured and swollen to the point of immobility. In the Lao'an battle, his left eyebrow was injured; in the Jinxiang battle, his right eyebrow was hit by a bullet, blood obscured his eyes, but his determination and loyalty to sacrifice and fight for the people to the end enabled him to complete his mission every time.
　　I would like to introduce Comrade Liu Ronghou's work with the highest respect and enthusiasm. This work should encourage all commanders and combatants who can write to pick up their pens. Facts prove that people who have personally experienced such thrilling scenes and created history with their lives, as long as they write down what they are most familiar with truthfully, they will certainly be able to deeply move people. This work should also educate our cultural workers engaged in military reporting to humbly learn from the broad masses of commanders and soldiers, strive to understand their experiences and feelings, write more concisely, plainly, and filled with the heroic spirit of the people's soldiers.

　　指战员们，笔枪齐发！
  　读刘荣厚的战斗速写
    吴象
    炮兵连长刘荣厚同志这篇三百余字的短作，寥寥几笔，却简洁、质朴而又明确地表现了我们炮兵的攻击精神，神妙技术和在战斗中的重大作用。人民解放军从蒋军手里缴获了无数美制的重武器，战斗力是空前无比的提高了。解放军建立了自己的炮兵，躲在坚硬的乌龟壳里的蒋军，再也无法幸免了。
    刘荣厚同志的作品，一开始就把激烈战斗中那种紧张的气氛，真实地传达了出来：“除夕拂晓，接受任务：摧毁巨野西关外的碉堡。同志们马上紧张的做工事，推炮，瞄准，射击，轰！”他不做作，不借助于多余的形容词，只真实地直写着自己所经历过的事件。但这决不只是一个粗略轮廓，他像粗线条的画家，把忠勇的神炮手们，在尘埃中满脸流汗的情景，都隐隐勾了出来。
    全篇的叙述自然地流露着人民战士那种伟大的强烈的爱憎分明的感情：“碉堡上的机枪又哭叫起来，好像炮弹没有吃够，我们不小气，很大方的，又给了它六发。”“它疯狂地封锁着前进的道路，好像是也想尝尝炮弹的滋味，我们马上答复它的要求。”我们战士确实是如此豪迈，如此充满着对卖国贼队伍的轻蔑，卑视，几乎可以使人看到他们射炮时那种坚定自信的微笑。
    刘荣厚连长写出这种伟大的感情是不奇怪的，因为这是自己的真实的感情。他曾经三次为人民流血，每次都坚持指挥位置，不下火烧，因而当选为战斗英雄，受到纵队党委会的通令表扬。鄄南战役中右臂负伤，肿得不能动。老岸战斗，左眉负伤；金乡战斗，右眉中弹，血流遮眼，但为人民牺牲奋斗到底的决心与忠诚，使他每一次都完成了任务。
    我愿以最高的敬意和热忱来介绍刘荣厚同志的作品，这作品应该鼓励所有能动笔的指挥员战斗员动起笔来。事实证明亲历了那样惊心动魄场面的，以自己的生命去创造历史的人们，只要如实写下自己最熟悉的东西，一定能够深刻动人。这作品也应该教育我们从事军事报导的文化工作者，虚心去向广大指战员学习，努力体会他们的经验和感情，写得更加简洁、质朴，而且充溢着人民战士豪迈的英雄气概。
