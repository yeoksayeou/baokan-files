　　Breaking Down Ideological Concerns and Commending Model Workers
    Licheng Promotes the Hundred-Day Textile Campaign
    [This Newspaper, Licheng News] The Chengguan base point convened a meeting on the 21st of this month with 84 textile heroes, skilled workers, and model cadres from six main villages to inspect and summarize the textile movement. A textile product exhibition was also held to promote large spinning wheels. The six villages have 1,113 women, organized into 102 groups, spinning more than 18,000 jin of yarn and weaving 17,000 jin of cloth. The experiences gained from these achievements are: 1. Breaking down several confused ideas. Women in Dongguan Village had fears about struggle, so Zhao Xitang, who started from labor, broke down the idea of "cutting leeks" (i.e., working only for oneself). Some women had conflicts with their families, so a meeting of daughters-in-law and mothers-in-law was held to discuss implementing an 20/80 profit sharing system to strengthen the relationship between mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law. The profit sharing method was: for families that hire out textile labor, the family gets 20% and the daughter-in-law gets 80%; for families that weave for themselves, the daughter-in-law gets 20% and the family gets 80%. There was also a belief that weaving for the public was insufficient, leading to a "give to the public" mentality. All the women studied current events and discussed the issue, realizing that high market prices were due to the lack of weaving last winter. Weaving for oneself and wearing one's own cloth, without buying foreign goods, is a struggle against the enemy. 2. Mutual competition, exhibition, and commendation. Chengnai stipulated a check-up every half month and an exhibition every twenty days to summarize, evaluate, reward, and commend. The Xiaguihua teams competed against each other, making a flag. Each time a model worker was selected, the whole village collectively presented the flag, which had a great motivating effect. 3. Improving technology and improving tools. Since the first month of the lunar year, Zhang Dacui's team in Dongguan has been rewarded for weaving one jin of good yarn with 12 liang (0.75 kg) of cotton, and 1 jin to 1 jin for third-class yarn. In terms of improving tools, since the first month of the lunar year, 10 hand-operated shuttles have been renovated, 28 old spinning wheels have been built, and 159 large spinning wheels have been added. Experiences in using large spinning wheels were exchanged at the meeting. For example, Wang Chong of Xiguan used to spin only 4 liang a day with an old wheel, but with a large wheel, he can spin 10 liang a day without even working hard, more than doubling his output. Finally, Zhang Dacui and others from the whole base point were selected as heroes and model workers.
    [This Newspaper News] In order to expand the textile organization, the Xiwu base point in Licheng First District organized young girls over ten years old and old women in their sixties and seventies, improved tools, promoted large spinning wheels, and completed the plan for each female spinner to produce six jin of homespun cloth per month. A meeting of cadres, textile heroes, and women from six villages in the Xiwu base point was held on March 21st to inspect Xiwu's textile work, conduct a summary, and select rewards. In order to break down women's disbelief in double-wheeled spinning wheels, a finished product and tool exhibition hall was specially organized. Zhang Jinfeng and two other women who knew how to use double-wheeled spinning wheels were hired to spin yarn in the exhibition hall, so the visiting women could learn. When they couldn't understand, explanations were given, breaking down the women's belief that new tools were inferior to old tools, and their disbelief in the efficiency of double-wheeled spinning wheels. For example, Liu Wenying, a woman from Xiwu, said: "A few days ago, the village chief mobilized me and said that making a two-wheeled spinning wheel could spin five more liang of cotton a day. I never believed it, but now that I've seen it with my own eyes, I know it can spin more. I'll go home tonight and ask the carpenter to modify my wheel. Being able to spin five or six more liang of cotton a day means I can earn a lot more money!" Within two days, Xiwu increased its number of double-wheeled spinning wheels by twenty, and every household in Xishuiyang ordered wheel rims to改造spinning wheels. In terms of expanding women's organizations, after inspection, Xiwu clarified that female children over ten years old should be organized by teachers to combine learning and spinning cotton. Old people should participate in spinning yarn while taking care of household affairs and children. Men should use production gaps to help with weaving, such as winding yarn while transporting manure, so as to increase the output of textile products.
    At the meeting, a summary and evaluation were conducted, and twelve textile heroes, including Liu Chong'er, ten model teachers, including Hao Jifeng, twenty-eight skilled textile workers, including Gao Chunhuan, thirty-six textile model workers, including Wang Guimiao, and eleven model textile cadres, including Li Xiping, were selected and awarded prizes and certificates respectively. Everyone unanimously proposed that stepping up production was to support the front lines. (Fan Renqing)

　　打破思想顾虑表扬模范
    黎城推进百日纺织
    【本报黎城讯】城关基点，于本月二十一日召集六个主村纺织英雄能手模范干部八十四人开会，检查总结纺织运动。并举行纺织成品展览推广大纺车。六村有妇女一千一百一十三名，组成一百零二个小组，纺线一万八千余斤，织布一万七千斤。获得这些成绩的经验：一、打破几种糊涂思想，东关村妇女存在怕斗争思想，便以是劳动起家的赵西堂，打破了割韭菜思想，还有妇女与家不和，又召开媳妇与婆婆会，讨论实行二八分红，密切了婆媳关系。分红办法：给外纺织家庭得二媳妇得八，给自家纺织媳妇得二家庭得八。还有认为给公家织不够，产生交公思想。全体妇女研究讨论，学习时事，认识了市价高是因去冬未织，自织自穿不买外货，这是对敌斗争。二、互相竞赛，展览表扬。城内规定半个月一检查，二十天一展览，总结评选奖励表扬，下桂花队与队竞赛，做旗一面，每次选出模范全村集体送旗，鼓舞作用很大。三、提高技术，改良工具，东关纺织英雄张大翠队的变工织布一斤纺好线十二两，三等线斤对斤，奖励了纺好线。在改良工具上，正月以来改造手穿机十架，造旧纺车二十八辆，增加大纺车一百五十九辆，并在会中交流使用大纺车的经验，如西关王崇用旧车一天才纺四两，用大车一天纺十两还不紧，一天就能超过一倍半。最后选出全基点张大翠等十人为英雄模范。
    【本报讯】黎城一区西仵基点为扩大纺织组织，把十岁以上的小女儿和六七十岁的老太婆也都组织起来，改良工具，推广大纺车，完成每个纺妇每月六斤土布计划，特于三月二十一日召开西仵基点六个村的干部纺织英雄妇女们中检查西仵纺织，进行总结评选奖励。为了打破妇女不相信双轮纺车的思想，又专门组织了成品和工具展览馆，聘请张金峰等三个会使双轮纺车的妇女，亲到展览馆里纺线，叫参观的妇女来学。看不透时便给说明，打破了妇女认为新工具不如旧工具，不相信双轮纺车效率大的思想。如西仵妇女刘文英说：“前几天村长动员说叫我做两轮纺车一天能多纺五两花，我始终不相信，现在亲眼看到就是能多纺，我今晚上回家就去叫木匠给我改车，一天能多纺五六两花，可不少赚钱哩！”西仵在两天内双轮纺车增加二十辆，西水洋家家户户订车轮要改造纺车。在扩大妇女组织上，经过检查，西仵明确了十岁以上的女儿童由教员组织，做到学习和纺花结合，老年人参加纺线照理家务，并照顾小孩，男人要用生产空隙帮助纺织，如在运粪中拐线，这样即增加纺织成品。
    会上进行了总结评选，选出纺织英雄刘虫儿等十二名，模范老师郝记风等十名，纺织能手高春环等二十八名，纺织模范王贵苗等三十六名，纺织模范干部李息平等十一名，并分别发给奖品奖状，大家一致提出加紧生产即为支援前线。        （范任卿）
