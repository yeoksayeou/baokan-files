　　Zhangbin Middle School Anniversary
　　Reviewing Learning and Production Achievements
　　[This Newspaper] The Zhangbin Middle School held an anniversary exhibition which began on March 25th and concluded successfully on the afternoon of the 27th. In addition to reviewing the learning and production achievements of the past year, the exhibition also included a forum with students' parents. From start to finish, the entire event was organized, arranged, and hosted by the students of each class themselves, with the school providing only general guidance, greatly improving the students' practical working abilities. The school has achieved significant results in learning and production over the past year. In addition to solving the problems of reading, writing, and arithmetic, students have gained a general understanding of studying history from new perspectives and simple mechanical principles and agricultural knowledge. In particular, in terms of ideological gains, after studying the issue of "land returning home," children of landlords realized that their families' wealth originated from exploitation and that mass struggle is justified, while children of liberated peasants generally improved their class consciousness. In terms of production, the entire student body has earned nearly one million yuan from various production activities throughout the year, achieving self-sufficiency and semi-self-sufficiency. During the exhibition, the school students organized two evening parties, performing ten plays, all of which were written and performed by the students themselves, acting out their own stories, for their own viewing, self-organized and hosted, and the performance effects were very good, with the masses staying until the end of the show. The central slogan of the school at the exhibition was "Take a step further on the basis of existing achievements." In the two-week learning and production blitz, each class summarized many experiences and lessons, which have been put into action after the conference.

　　Furthermore, in order to solve the difficulties of old self-funded students, the school is now piloting a new method, stipulating that each old self-funded student who pays 20,000 yuan to the school will be treated as a publicly funded student, and those who pay 10,000 yuan will be treated as a half-publicly funded student. After receiving this amount, the school is responsible for investing in the production sector. When students withdraw from school or graduate halfway, the original amount will be returned. After the implementation of this method, students and their parents feel it is very convenient. (Zhang Xun)

　　漳滨中学建校周年
    检阅学习生产成绩
    【本报讯】漳滨中学纪念一周年展览会，于三月二十五日开始，二十七日下午完满结束。这次展览会除检阅一年学习与生产成绩外，并召开了学生家长座谈会。由开始到结束，完全由各班学生亲自动手布置、组织与主持，校部只做一般指导，对学生的实际工作能力＠炼很大。该校一年来在学习与生产上收获很大，除解决了读写算问题外，并普遍了解用新的观点研究历史以及简单的机械原理与农业知识，特别在思想收获上，学过“土地回家”问题后，地主子弟认识到自己家庭是剥削起家，群众斗争是合理的，翻身子弟则普遍提高了阶级觉悟。生产方面，全校同学在各种生产上全年共获利近百万元，做到了自给与半自给。在展览会期间，该校学生共组织了两个晚会，演出十个戏，这些戏都是由学生自编自演，演自己事，给自己看，自己组织与主持，演出效果很好，群众直看到演完才走。该校在展览会上的中心口号是“在已有的成绩基础上再提高一步”。各班在两个星期的学习生产突击中，总结出许多经验教训，在大会结束后，已将这些经验贯彻到行动中去。
    又，该校为解决老自费生困难，现试行一种新办法，规定每个老自费生向学校交两万元者按公费待遇，交一万元者按半公费待遇。学校收到这笔款后，负责投入生产部门，学生半途退学或毕业时，仍将原款发还。这一办法实行后，学生及其家长都感到很大方便。（章训）
