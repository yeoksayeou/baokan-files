　　Changing Old Judicial Traditions
    Establishing Mediation Organizations in Rural Areas
    The Taihang Third Special District Administrative Office Judicial Conference Determines Methods
    [Our newspaper's Changzhi dispatch] The Taihang Third Special District Administrative Office convened a meeting of judicial section chiefs from various counties on April 13th. Based on the experience of judicial work going to the countryside during the land reform, the following methods were determined for the future:
    1.  Within the scope of this special district, universally organize civil mediation among district villagers, boldly and unreservedly entrusting judicial authority (limited to civil mediation) to the masses. Allow the masses to resolve their own problems, eliminate civil disputes within mutual aid groups and production brigades, achieving village matters resolved in the village, district matters resolved in the district, reducing civil litigation, and saving manpower, material resources, and time.
    2.  Responsible cadres of the special district and county judicial departments should directly participate in the large-scale production movement. Establish mediation organizations and support mass mediation work within the large-scale production movement. Break with the old bureaucratic bad habits of sitting in offices and asking about lawsuits, and oppose the superficial style of running around aimlessly.
    3.  Organize all self-reformers to participate in various production activities, mainly in agriculture, handicrafts, and workshops, to cultivate their production skills, achieve self-sufficiency in food and clothing, reduce the burden on the people, with the government not providing a single grain and the families of self-reformers not supplying a single grain. Furthermore, use a certain amount of surplus materials from production to support the front lines. (Yuan Ping, Fu Bi)

　　改变旧的司法传统
    下乡建立调解组织
    太行三专署司法会议确定办法
    【本报长治讯】太行第三专署，于四月十三日，召开各县司法科长会议，特依据土地改革中司法下乡的经验，确定今后办法：
    一、在本专区范围内，普遍的组织区村民事调解，把司法职权（只限于民事调解），大胆放手的交给群众，由群众自己来解决自己的问题，把民事纠纷消灭在互助小组、生产大队里，做到村事村了，区事区了，减少民事诉讼，节省民力、民财、民时。
    二、专、县司法负责干部，直接参加到大生产运动中，在大生产运动中，建立调解组织，扶植群众调解工作。打破坐机关问官司的旧官僚恶习，反对走马观花的乱跑腿作风。
    三、组织全部自新人参加各种生产，以农业、手工业、作坊为主，以培养其生产技术，做到吃穿自给，减轻民负，政府不发一粒粮，自新人家中不供给一粒粮，并拿出生产中一定数目的剩余物资支援前线。（原平、辅弼）
