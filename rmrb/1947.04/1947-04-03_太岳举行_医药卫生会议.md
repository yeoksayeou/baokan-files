　　Taiyue Holds
    Medical and Health Conference
    [This newspaper's Taiyue dispatch, 1st] In order to organize all medical and health workers in the region to fully support the front lines, and to promote the hygiene movement of the vast number of liberated peasants this year, the Taiyue District held a medical and health symposium on the 17th of last month. During the week from the 17th to the 25th, in the process of discussing the idea of "one for all, all for one", four kinds of thoughts were discovered and have been resolved. A brief description is as follows: First, wholeheartedly serve the masses, represented by the model doctor Li Ke, whose main characteristics are: he proposed that doctors should have three savings, namely saving manpower, material resources, and animal power; three hearts, namely, humbly learning, determined to educate, and enthusiastic responsibility; and four fears not, namely, not afraid of wind and rain, not afraid of cold and heat, not afraid of trouble, and not afraid of the dark. In the past year, he organized 168 doctors, transformed five old drugstores into new cooperatives, and at the same time proposed that prevention is more important than cure, actively carrying out mass epidemic prevention work, reducing diseases, and reducing deaths. Doctors should directly participate in the war, and he organized mobile medical teams to serve the self-defense front. Second, they are willing to serve the masses but have difficulties, such as family life and dispatching problems that have not been well resolved. Comrade Zheng Jinyun from Fushan handled the problem of family life very appropriately. He mobilized the whole family to participate in labor and give full play to their skills. His 61-year-old father worked as a doctor, his wife made vinegar, and his mother and sister-in-law spun and weaved, earning more than two stones of millet in a month. Third, doctors with landlord backgrounds have the problem of their future after being liquidated. Zhao Sijing from Jincheng, in the process of ideological transformation, turned from resenting the masses and attempting revenge to wanting to avoid worldly affairs and enter the mountains to practice asceticism. After realizing that serving the masses was the only way out, he truly started to work. Now the masses in his village are automatically raising funds to welcome him to establish a medical cooperative. Fourth, how can public doctors break away from simply serving their own units and better integrate with landlord doctors and the vast rural masses? The Fourth Branch of Guanghua Hospital in Yangcheng Gulu and the Medical Department of the Yangcheng Sixth District United Cooperative have opened training institutes to train new doctors, unite and improve old doctors, study business and improve technology, and prepare to carry out rural health campaigns. At present, the focus is on participating in the war. According to statistics, a total of more than 150 new doctors have been trained. Doctors who have moved from the organs to the countryside are the most supported by the masses.

### 太岳举行  医药卫生会议

　　太岳举行
    医药卫生会议
    【本报太岳一日电】为组织全区医药卫生工作者全力支援前线，并推动今年广大翻身农民卫生运动，太岳区于上月十七日举行医药卫生座谈会。自十七日至二十五日一周来讨论“一人为大家，大家为一人”的思想过程中，发现了四种思想，并且已得到解决，兹简述如下：第一种、全心全意为群众服务，以模范医生李克为代表，其主要特点：他提出医生要有三省，即节省人力、物力、和畜力；三心，即虚心学习、决心教育、热心负责；和四不怕，即不怕风雨、不怕冷热、不怕麻烦、不怕摸黑。一年来他组织医生一百六十八个，把五个旧药店改造成新的合作社，同时提出防病重于治病，积极开展群众防疫工作，减少疾病，减少死亡。医生要直接参加战争，他组织巡回医疗队服务自卫前线。第二种、愿为群众服务但有困难，如家庭生活和支差等问题没很好解决。浮山郑锦云同志对家庭生活问题处理的很适当，他动员全家参加劳动，发挥一技之长，六十一岁老父亲当医生，自己女人做醋，母亲弟媳纺花织布，一个月中共赚小米两石多。第三种、地主成份的医生，存在被清算后的出路问题。晋城赵思敬在思想改造过程中是由怨恨群众企图报复转入想避开世事入山修行，在认识到只有为群众服务是条出路后，才真正干起来，现在他村群众自动集资欢迎他成立医药合作社。第四种、公营医生如何打破单纯为本单位服务，更与地主医生及广大农村群众结合起来。阳城广华医院固隆第四分院和阳城六区联社的医药部，曾开设训练研究所，培养新医生，团结和提高老医生，研究业务提高技术，准备开展农村卫生运动。目前则以参战为主，据统计先后共培养出新医生一百五十余个，从机关走到农村的医生是群众最拥护的。
