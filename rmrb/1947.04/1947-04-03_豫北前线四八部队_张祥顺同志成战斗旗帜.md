　　Northern Henan Front, Fourth Column

　　Comrade Zhang Xiangshun Becomes a Combat Banner

　　[This newspaper dispatch] Comrade Ren Dawei of the Northern Henan Front reports: Zhang Xiangshun, the seventh squad leader of the first company, who was awarded the title of First-Class Hero for Killing Enemies by the Fourth Column, is not only a combat hero but also a model worker. The regimental party committee is now calling on the entire regiment to launch a "Learn from Zhang Xiangshun" campaign and learn from him extensively. Zhang Xiangshun was originally a new comrade liberated during the Pinghan Campaign. He is 22 years old this year and comes from Hunan. To avoid being conscripted by Chiang's army, after his mother was detained, he wrote to rescue his mother and was forced to join the Thirtieth Army. When he first arrived, he was greatly misled and had a great deal of fear. However, when he arrived at the company, he received cordial comfort and conversation from the instructor. The soldiers saw that he had no shoes, so they gave him shoes to wear. Everyone shared cigarettes and treated him specially. Soon he felt the warmth of the people's army and felt "better than at his own home." He said, "I want to do real work to live up to everyone." After the speaking bitterness campaign, his class consciousness rapidly increased, and he realized that the source of his suffering was Chiang Kai-shek, that Chiang Kai-shek was his great enemy, and that he must resolutely defeat Chiang Kai-shek to avenge himself. In his first battle, he showed extraordinary bravery and decisiveness. When the enemy attacked Shimenkou, the company was tasked with blocking the front. He volunteered to go to the front line. When the enemy counterattacked and the first squad retreated, he and Wu Dekui held the line and chased the enemy to Matoukou, where they captured a prisoner and retrieved a gun. When attacking Gaozhuang, he was promoted to squad leader himself. In order to respond to the call of the regimental leaders to strive for the model of the entire regiment, he was determined to capture the first prisoner and obtain the first gun. When he led the entire squad into the village, he intercepted an enemy. He jumped up to seize the enemy's gun, but the enemy grabbed his gun. He then took out a grenade and smashed it at the enemy's hand. When the enemy let go and tried to run, he grabbed him again, completing the task of getting a gun and a prisoner. Later, he joined the party and became a firm and forward-marching fighter for the people. During the Battle of Loulou, he was wounded in the head. When he was told to go down, he said, "If I go down, there will be no one to lead this squad. As long as I can fight and run, I will still fight the enemy." He used grenades to cover the wounded comrades as they retreated and continued to put forward, "The enemy has injured our comrades, we must resolutely eliminate the enemy and avenge our comrades." He again organized a charge and ran to the front of the assault team. When the sappers went up and blew open a gap, the enemy wavered. He then used his wit and flexibility to call on the enemy to surrender. Finally, the enemies handed over their guns. He followed a private down, and the prisoner gave him a gold ring. He refused, saying, "What we want is weapons." He also introduced the situation in the liberated areas to them, stabilizing the emotions of the new prisoners. In various battles, he showed exemplary actions in all aspects. In peacetime, his leadership in various tasks was also very democratic. Everyone discussed matters and gave full play to the enthusiasm of each comrade. He said, "To do a good job in the squad depends on everyone." When the superiors called for the establishment of mutual aid groups, he took the lead in mobilizing them. When organizing training, he would say to everyone, "Sweat more in peacetime to learn good techniques, and bleed less in wartime, so you can kill more enemies." The whole squad practiced very carefully. When drawing up plans, he first put forward his own, and then provided specific assistance, and summarized everyone's plans into a plan for the whole squad. Therefore, his seventh squad was very enthusiastic. He was also very attentive and helpful to his comrades on a daily basis. He was able to unite everyone, and he was also able to work hard and take the lead. Every time he marched, he carried public goods first. When he settled down, he would start looking for a pot to cook rice and carry out mass work. Because he was very kind, the relationship between the army and the people was also the most harmonious. Now he is widely regarded by the soldiers of the Fourth Column as "The squad that has Zhang Shunxiang is a model squad." Zhang Shunxiang has become a glorious combat banner of the Fourth Column in northern Henan.

　　豫北前线四八部队
    张祥顺同志成战斗旗帜
    【本报讯】豫北前线任大卫同志报导：荣获四八部队一等杀敌英雄称号的一连七班长张祥顺同志，是战斗英雄也是工作模范，现团党委会号召全团要开展个张祥顺运动，普遍的向他学习。张祥顺原是平汉战役解放过来的一个新同志，现年廿二岁，湖南人，因避蒋军抓丁，他母亲被扣起后，他写了救出老母，便被迫进三十军当兵。初过来时，因受蒙蔽，恐惧心很大。但一到连上受到指导员亲切的安慰和谈话，战士们见他没鞋，就送他鞋穿，大家分烟抽，也特别优待他，很快他感到了人民军队的温暖，觉得“比在自己家还要好”。他说：“要实际干，好对住大家。”经过诉苦运动，阶级觉悟迅速提高，认识到自己苦根是蒋介石，蒋介石是自己的大仇人，要坚决打败蒋介石来报仇。初参加战斗他就表现了异常的勇猛、果敢，敌人进攻石门口时，连担任正面堵击，他自动要求到最前面，当敌人反扑，一班退下来时，他便和武德奎顶住打，将敌人追到马头口，上去捉住一个俘虏，得回一支枪来。袭击高庄时，他自己升任班长。为了响应团首长争取全团模范的号召，他决心要捉第一个俘虏和得第一支枪，当他带领全班冲进村时，截住一个敌人，他跳上去夺敌人的枪，敌人抓住了他的枪，他便拿出手榴弹就砸敌人的手。敌人一散手想跑，他又一把捉住，完成了一支枪、一个俘虏的任务。后来他入了党，更成了一个坚定为人民的前进战士了。鹿楼战斗时，他头部负了伤，要他下去，他说：“下去没人带这个班了，能打能跑就还要与敌人拚”。他以手榴弹掩护受伤的同志下来，并继续提出“敌人打伤我们同志，我们要坚决消灭敌人，为同志们报仇。”再次组织了冲锋。他参加突击组跑到最前面。当工兵上去炸开一个缺口时，敌人动摇了，他便用机智灵活的喊话争取敌人投降，最后敌人都交了枪。他跟着一个一等兵下来，那俘虏就给他金戒指，他不要，他说：“我们要的是武器。”并将解放区的情形向他们介绍了好多，安定了新俘虏的情绪。历次战斗，他在各方面都表现出模范的行动；在平时各项工作中，他的领导亦是非常民主的，有事大家商议，发挥每个同志的积极性。他说：“班里要搞好全靠大家。”上级号召建立互助组，他便首先动员；组织练兵时，他就向大家讲：“平时多流汗学好技术，战时就少流血，可以多杀伤敌人。”全班都练的甚用心，订计划，他先提出自己的，然后进行具体帮助，并将各人的总结为全班的计划。因而，他所在的七班都是很起劲的。日常对同志们的关照及互助友爱也都很周到。他既能团结大家，又能实际苦干、带头，每次行军他都先背公家东西；住下来，就动手找锅作饭，并进行群众工作。因他非常和气，军民关系也最融洽。现他在四八部队战士中已普遍被认为“那班有了张顺祥，那班就模范”。张顺祥已成为豫北四八部队一面光辉的战斗旗帜。
