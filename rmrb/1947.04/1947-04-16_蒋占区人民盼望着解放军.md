The people in Chiang-Occupied Areas Yearn for the People's Liberation Army
　　Fang De

　　This reporter walked through the豫北 (Yu Bei) Plain, west of the Pinghan Railway, south of the Daoqing Railway, and north of the Yellow River. The common people all said, "Our people are finally here!" Looking at the disasters suffered by the people during the Chiang army's occupation, one understands the profound sorrow and bloodstained tears contained in this sentence. Meng Fandong, the Chiang army's county magistrate of Ji County, heavily relied on Hu Heqing, who had served as a puppet for the Japanese invaders in Shangguan Village for eight years, as his henchman. On October 19th, Hu arrested Zhang Zhongting, a local villager, on the charge that he had served as a cook for the democratic county government for one year. According to the Chiang family government's decision to "treat those who repent and start anew with leniency," he was buried alive, and all his family property was confiscated. Coincidentally, his mother-in-law came to visit relatives, and the donkey she rode was also confiscated. Now, the family is left with only a sixty-eight-year-old mother, a twenty-one-year-old widow, and two young children. The family planted seven mu of alkaline land, from which the Chiang army requisitioned wheat seven times in five months, each time taking four dou from a twenty-two jin dou. After taking it all, they told the women to register as refugees to receive "relief grain" distributed by "UNRRA." After being tricked into registering, they didn't receive any relief grain. The old woman said, "I'd rather starve to death than register." In the early stages of the Chiang army's occupation of this area, the "killing competition" became one of the top priorities. I'll just give one example from the Chiang-controlled township government of Guogu Collection: in Lujiu, they arrested more than thirty men and women at once, loaded them onto seven large carts, and sent them to Shangguan Village to be buried alive. The murderers first poured water into the burial pit, stirring it into a muddy slurry, then put the people in, rolled them into mud balls, and then buried them. Relatives who stole the corpses back couldn't recognize who belonged to which family. In addition, the military expenses levied by the Chiang army were also shockingly high. Taking Hua County, with a population of 700,000, as an example, according to the Chiang-controlled government's own admission, the military expenses for the self-defense corps for the three months of August, September, and October alone reached 12,282,000, in addition to 70,210 jin of horse feed, 117,000 jin of grass, and 144,000 jin of firewood. Zhao Rangcai, a wealthy farmer in Zhao Village, twenty li north of Yanjin, planted thirty mu of alkaline land. Last year, he harvested fourteen shi of autumn grain, from which he had to give up thirteen shi. His family has many members, and he sold his only donkey to exchange for some grain, which has long been eaten. Now, they are relying entirely on a few rotten sweet potatoes to survive. How can they endure until the long summer harvest! While enduring suffering, the people are looking forward to the People's Liberation Army. At the same time, they are fighting against the Chiang family bandits, using the methods they used to deal with the Japanese invaders to deal with these demons. They hide their grain, waiting to give it to the People's Liberation Army when they arrive. The army arrived south of Hua County almost at dawn. Unexpectedly, within two hours, the common people had prepared all the grain for the army to eat. The masses said, "Even if we eat less ourselves, we must feed our army." In a village thirty li east of Xinxiang, a landlord donated sixteen shi of grain. The commander of the garrison asked him, "Have you discussed this with your family? Do they agree?" The landlord replied, "Chiang Kai-shek is selling out the country. In order not to be a subjugated people, I should contribute a little something to the country."

　　蒋占区人民盼望着解放军
    方德
    记者走过平汉路西、道清路南、黄河以北这块豫北平原，老百姓都说：“咱的人可来啦”！看看蒋军占领时期老百姓所受的灾难，就知道这句话含着多少惨痛的血泪。汲县蒋军县长孟繁栋，重用在上官村给日本强盗当过八年汉奸的胡和清作爪牙，胡于十月十九日抓走当地老百姓张忠庭，罪名是因为他曾经给民主县政府当过一年炊事员，按照蒋家政府“悔过自新从宽处理”的决定，他被活埋了，还没收他的全部家产；碰巧丈母娘来串亲戚，她骑的毛驴也被没收了。现在家里只剩下一个六十八岁的老娘，二十一岁的寡妻和两个幼子。家里种了七亩碱地，五个月中就被蒋军要过七回麦，二十二斤的斗每回要四斗。要光了又叫娘们列入难民册去领“行总”发放的“救济粮”。受骗上了名字后，一点救济粮也没得到，老太太说：“宁愿饿死，也不愿去上名了。”蒋军占领这个地区的初期，屠杀“竞赛”即成为首要项目之一。我只举郭固集蒋记镇公所的一个例子：在陆韭，一次就抓了三十多个男女同胞，装成七大车送到上官村去活埋，杀人凶犯，先把埋人坑放上水搅成泥浆糊，然后把人放进去，滚成一个泥蛋以后才埋上土。偷尸的亲人将尸首刨回去，谁也认不清是谁家的人。此外，蒋军所征的军费，也大得骇人听闻。以七十万人口的滑县来说，据蒋记政府自供，一次所征八、九、十、三个月自卫总队军费，即达一万二千二百八十二万，另外还有马料七万零二百一十斤，草十一万七千斤，柴火十四万四千斤。延津以北二十里赵庄的富农赵让才，种三十来亩碱地，去年收了十四石秋，就出了十三石，家里人口多，把仅有一头毛驴卖了，换些粮食早就吃光啦，现在全靠几块烂红薯过日子，怎么能挨到漫长的夏收呢！人民一方面忍受着苦难，在期待着解放军，一方面和蒋家匪徒进行斗争，用对付日本强盗的办法，去对付这些魔鬼们。他们把粮食藏起来，等待着解放军来时送给解放军。大军到滑县以南已经快黎明了，想不到在两个钟头以内，老百姓就把军队吃的粮食全准备妥了。群众都说：“那怕自己少吃一点，也得给咱军队吃。”新乡以东三十里某村，一家地主献出十六石粮食，驻军首长曾问他：“你和你家里人商量过没有？他们同意不？”这个地主回答：“蒋介石卖国，俺为了不当亡国奴，应该为国家供献点小意思。”
