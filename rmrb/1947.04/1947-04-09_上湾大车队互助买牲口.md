　　【Report from this newspaper in Licheng】Chang Sanhai, leader of the large cart team in Shangwan Village, Third District, in order to continue developing livestock and facilitate and expand production, specially organized everyone to discuss using the dividends from the large cart team to help those who are willing to buy livestock. Chang Santian borrowed 100,000 yuan to buy a mule. He attached it to his own large cart and joined the large cart team, slowly earning dividends to repay the loan. Now he only owes 20,000 yuan. After three more transports, he will be able to pay it off. With this method, the entire village increased eight donkeys and one mule, exchanged two donkeys, and exchanged four mules and horses after the rent reduction last winter.

　　上湾大车队互助买牲口
    【本报黎城讯】三区上湾村常三孩领导大车队，为了继续发展牲口，便利与扩大生产，特组织大家讨论，拿上大车队中红利，帮助愿意买牲口的人买牲口。常三田借了十万元买了一头骡，架上他自己原有的大车，参加了大车队，慢慢赚红利来还借款，现在还的只空两万元了，再运输三次，就可以还清了。这样办法，全村去冬查减后增加八头驴一头骡，换驴两头，换骡马四头。（芳芹、三贤、恩崇、丙南、尚芹）
