　　Explosion Hero of Pingding
    Mu Xicheng Achieves Another Great Feat
    Blowing Up and Wounding Over Eighty of the Puppet Yan Troops in One Instance
    [Pingding News] Recently, the stubborn Yan troops have been carrying out extensive activities in the villages along the border of our county, dividing their forces for surprise attacks and converging assaults, surrounding villages at night. Wherever they go, they dig through walls and holes, and excavate three feet into the ground, looting even rotten grain and torn clothing. In early April, the county headquarters issued instructions to all villages, calling for a greater effort to launch the "Mǎn Tiān Xīng" (满天星, "Sky Full of Stars") explosion campaign to repel the enemy's offensive. Mu Xicheng (瓦岭村 Wǎlǐng Cūn, Waling Village), the county's top explosion hero (from Waling Village on the border of the eighth district), upon hearing this news, immediately mobilized the masses in the entire village to ensure that every household planted mines that would detonate. He personally checked and guided the mine-laying work from door to door. Every night, the entire village was covered with landmines, totaling 220 mines. At dawn on April 19, the third battalion of the Yan army stationed in Bǎijǐng 柏井 (Baijing), in coordination with the "Homecoming Corps" (还乡团, Huánxiāng Tuán) numbering over 700 men, surrounded the village. After the enemy entered the village, explosions occurred everywhere they stepped. Comrade Mu Xicheng led the militia to take advantage of the situation and attack the enemy, who immediately abandoned more than 30 bodies and fled in panic, with no losses to the masses. In this operation, a total of 152 stone mines and 30 landmines were detonated, killing 38 enemy soldiers and wounding 50. After receiving the good news, the county headquarters immediately issued a circular to the entire county to commend Mu Xicheng and awarded him a major merit. (Meng Ming, Ji Ying, Sheng Rong)
