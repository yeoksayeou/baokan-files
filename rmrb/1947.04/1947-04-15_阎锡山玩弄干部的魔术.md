　　Yan Xishan's Magic Trick of Playing with Cadres
    Zhai Pinsan

    I have now broken free from Yan Xishan's shackles and stand firmly and honorably on the side of the people. Recalling the period before and after the War of Resistance Against Japan, I worked as a secretary in the Finance Department of the Shanxi Provincial Government. I received three months of training at the Institute of National Revolutionary Theory and Implementation (?), and later participated in the work of the Three Administrative Offices. After the "Qiulin Conference," Yan Xishan became increasingly reactionary, and I unwittingly became a minor pawn in Yan Xishan's implementation of reactionary conspiracies.

    In September of the 29th year of the Republic (1940), I returned to Kenanpo in Jixian County from southeastern Shanxi. Through a friend's introduction, I met Zhao Daiwen, who then introduced me to Yan Xishan. As expected, after registering at the Foreign Affairs Office, a time was quickly set for an audience. It turned out that after Yan Xishan's so-called "New Army rebellion," he was afraid that more people would continue to leave him. Therefore, he instructed his senior and close personnel to introduce any cadres who were relatively capable and had a bit of a brain to meet and talk with him, so that he could personally impart his teachings.

    Not long after talking with Yan, I was transferred to the position of Colonel Counselor in the Counselor's Office. Whenever there were meetings, he would often nominate me and ask for my opinion. From then on, I was convinced that Yan Xishan truly appreciated me in a special way. Other than repaying him with "loyal ministers and righteous men," I would no longer doubt or consider his feudal and reactionary essence, as well as those acts of sham resistance and counter-revolution.

    Yang Zhenji, an old classmate from the Education College of Shanxi University, was at this time the Secretary-General and Commissioner of the 14th Administrative District of Jixian County as the founder of the Enemy Work Corps. He was one of the most popular figures rising under Yan Xishan. He pulled me into the work of the Enemy Work Corps, and Wen Zhendong introduced me to the core organization of the Comrades Association. At the end of November of the 29th year, I crossed the Yellow River from Mianchi and lived in Yuli, Yuanqu.

    At this time, the Central Army under the command of Wei Lihuang retreated to the vicinity of Yuanqu. The Central Army had always been sheep under the Japanese devils and tigers on the heads of miscellaneous troops. Li Yurong, the Kuomintang's Special Commissioner for Party Affairs Supervision in the Fifth War Zone (Shanxi), used the "Mount Tai pressing down" force to strike at the personnel of the Second War Zone, especially the strength of the Enemy Work Corps, the Second Branch School of the Military Police (actually an infantry regiment). Fu Haiyun, the Education Director, and I launched several counter-attacks against Li Yurong. At this time, I truly became a "slave" and "lackey" for Yan Xishan.

    In April of the 30th year (1941), I returned to Kenanpo. I reported to Yan Xishan on how we fought against Li Yurong. Yan Xishan's satisfied expression suggested to me that I was now qualified to be a "loyal and unwavering" believer.

    Not long after returning to Kenanpo, Yan Xishan suddenly wanted me to be the magistrate of Fencheng County. Being a county magistrate was the most difficult and arduous job at the time, especially in the semi-occupied areas. The three major tasks of collecting grain, cloth, and soldiers, if not completed, would not only lead to a loss of reputation but also to legal punishment. I arrived in Fencheng on June 19th and immediately started collecting grain. The quota was 20,158 dan, to be completed within three months.

    The public miscellaneous expenses stipulated by Yan Xishan for the organs were very small. At that time, the entire monthly legal tender for the county government was only more than two hundred yuan, which was not enough to buy a district of hemp paper, but exceeding it could not be reimbursed. Yan Xishan's clever use was here, which was to force you onto the path of breaking the law. Only with Yan Xishan's grace could you not be questioned; you could not clear yourself. If you were once displeased, Yan Xishan could question you at any time. When I first became a county magistrate, I did not understand these things, and I incurred a lot of public miscellaneous expenses. I requested from above, and the provincial government instructed "to make up for it by economizing." I again reasoned that "the more I economize, the more I lose, so how can I make up for it?" and directly telegraphed Yan Xishan for a request. Yan announced this matter at the morning meeting and scolded the members of the provincial government to a pulp. Later, a friend told me, "Announcing your telegram, everyone under the cauldron who had been responsible was sympathetic in their hearts. However, the chairman has buried a landmine for you." From then on, the provincial government's reprimands came one after another for various reasons.

    After the grassroots cadre conference in February of the 31st year (1942), the provincial government's resident county inspection commissioner and the county branch director, who coordinated with me in my work, were all replaced. I felt that things were a bit bad. The newly appointed Provincial Inspection Commissioner Zhang Jiquan and County Director Yang Ruzhi, as soon as they arrived in Fencheng, together with the political secretary (who had the special responsibility of supervising the county magistrate) He Tingyu, attacked my prestige among the cadres and restrained my work. Finally, they even instigated the police chief to lead the police to defect. Patrol officers Ma Yong and Lu Xianglong, unwilling to make trouble, informed me. I quickly arrested Yang Changjian before he could react, but I never expected that six people, including the second-level official Xi Zhu of the Ninth Administrative District, would jointly attack me. When the War Committee of the Jixian Special District investigated the relevant personnel, the chairman Yang Chengyuan actually sided with them in his summary. Afraid of being framed, I ran to Kenanpo to complain to Yan Xishan. Coincidentally, the Fencheng battle broke out, and Yan ordered me to return overnight to help Division Commander Shi Zeibo fight. After three months of fighting desperately, I collected three months' worth of grain again. The cries of "assault" and "expose" were deafening again, and I had no choice but to retreat, knowing it was difficult, and resigned due to illness. Returning to Kenanpo, Yan Xishan did not see me. From then on, I gradually became disheartened.

    In June of the 34th year (1945), it was time to collect grain again. Fencheng was assigned more than 100,000 shi, exceeding the figures of previous years. At this time, Yan Xishan thought of me again and wanted me to take over as the chairman of the Fencheng General Committee (an institution responsible for the overall responsibility of the entire county). This was of course hoping that I would conveniently take the more than 100,000 shi of grain. On June 27th, I went to Fencheng again and worked day and night to collect grain. Who knew that at the end of July, locusts were first discovered in Fencheng, and all the autumn crops were eaten by locusts. I barely collected more than 60,000 shi and could not collect any more. I telegraphed Yan Xishan according to the situation, and the instruction I received was "quickly tighten up the collection." I again reported in detail that the people were already starving to death, fleeing, and even hanging themselves and throwing themselves into wells. They were eating wormwood seeds, bean dregs, and wild vegetables, and sweet potatoes had become top-grade food. Division Commander Yang Wencai and I took turns going to various districts to hold sacrificial knife meetings (indicating the meaning of completing the grain without opening the knife), forcing all the cadres to kneel in front of the chairman's statue to reflect and cry bitterly. Although every village made a "suicide pledge," the effect was still very small. Yan Xishan argued that I was "alarmist and avoiding responsibility." In November, I again used the excuse that Fencheng had suffered particularly severe disasters and had collected particularly large amounts of grain over the years to request a reduction or exemption. However, Yan Xishan did not adopt it, and then came a wave of groundless "assaults" and "exposures." The result of the investigation was that "there was a reason for the incident, but it was not easy to obtain conclusive evidence." In this way, Yan Xishan "dismissed me from my post for investigation"!

    In the past, I often comforted myself with the thought that the heavy blows I had suffered were due to the fact that the major faction of the "Comrades Association" literary organization wanted to annex the minor faction of the Enemy Work Corps, or it could be said that Liang Huazhi wanted to eat and drink Yang Zhenji. Now I am completely awake. Yan Xishan basically has three magic tricks for cadres: First, "attract and rope in." When he thinks you can be his slave and lackey, he does not hesitate to lower his status and pretend to be "amiable and humble" and "approachable" to attract you first. Then, he uses his various organizations to trap you in a "cage." The second is "force you into the fire pit." When you have shown a certain role, fearing that you have unfavorable feelings about him in terms of wishes and thoughts, he gives you a "position of power" that looks very good on the surface, but in reality, it is forcing you into the fire pit. The third is "hide a knife in a smile." After you have entered the fire pit, you can only follow his heartfelt guidance to be "as gentle as a sheep internally," acting as a slave; and "as fierce as a tiger externally," acting as a lackey. If you listen to his insincere words of "caring about the suffering of the people" and shout and yell from the standpoint of the people, he will smile and praise you for being revolutionary and progressive, and teach you to be beaten "bloody and battered" and "completely scarred" by groundless "assaults" and "exposures." A little carelessness will lead you to the city of wrongful death. My personal experience is clear evidence. I think anyone who has had experience under Yan Xishan can prove it. This is the consistent mantra and inevitable means of the reactionary ruling class, but Yan Xishan is even more insidious and treacherous.

　　阎锡山玩弄干部的魔术
    翟品三
    我现在已摆脱阎锡山的羁绊，坚决而光荣的站到人民方面来。回忆抗战前后，我一直在山西省府财厅任秘书。在民族革命理论及实施（？）研究院受训三个月，后又参加三行署工作。“秋林会议”后，阎锡山日益反动，我也不自觉的作了阎锡山实行反动阴谋的一名小走卒。
    二十九年九月，我从晋东南返回吉县克难坡，经友人介绍见了赵戴文，又由赵介绍我见阎锡山。果然交际处一挂号，很快就定了时间传见。原来阎锡山在他所谓“新军叛变”之后，恐怕再有人继续离开他，所以示意他的高级和亲近人员，凡是比较干练而稍有点头脑的干部，都要介绍和他见面、谈话，由他亲传衣钵。
    和阎谈话后不久，调我任参事室上校参事。每逢开会，也常常提名问及意见，从此满心认为阎锡山对我真是特别赏识，除了以“忠臣义士”报答外，对他的封建反动的实质，以及那些假抗战，反革命的行径，再不去怀疑和考虑了。
    山西大学教育学院老同学杨贞吉，这时正以敌工团的创始人任总书记，兼吉县十四专署专员，是阎锡山手下后起来最红的一个。他拉我参加敌工团工作，并由温震东介绍参加了同志会核心之核心的基干组织。我于二十九年十一月底又从渑池渡河，住在垣曲峪里。
    这时，卫立煌指挥下的中央军，退在接近垣曲的附近。中央军一向是日寇手下的绵羊，杂牌头上的猛虎。国民党五区（山西）党务督导专员李犹龙更以“泰山压顶”之势，处处打击二战区人员，特别是敌工团的实力宪兵第二支校（实系步兵团）。教育长傅海云和我对李犹龙来过几次的反攻。这时，我确实对阎锡山做了“奴隶”兼“爪牙”了。
    我于三十年四月又回到克难坡。向阎锡山报告我们怎样和李犹龙斗争。阎锡山满意的表情，暗示了我这才够上一个“忠贞不二”的信徒。
    回克难坡不久，突然，阎锡山要我作汾城县长。作县长在当时是最繁难艰巨的工作，尤其在半沦陷区。征粮、征布、征兵三大任务，如完不成，不但声誉扫地，而且按律问罪。六月十九日到达汾城，首先就着手征粮。二万零一百五十八名，在三个月限期内完成。
    阎锡山规定的机关公杂费非常的少，当时县府全月法币不过二百多元，还不够买一区麻纸用，但超过了却报销不了。阎锡山的妙用却在这里，就是逼你走上犯法的道路。只能由阎锡山恩赐不追问，你不能自己说清白。如果你一旦不如意，阎锡山什么时候都能问你罪。我初作县长，不明白这些，公杂费亏下很多，向上请求，省府指示“撙节弥补”。我又以“越亏越多，从何弥补”为理由，迳电阎锡山请求，阎在朝会上宣布此事，把省府委员骂了个一塌糊涂。后来一位友好告诉我：“宣布你的电报，洪炉台下凡是负过责的人，无不心里同情。但是，会长却给你埋下地雷了。”从此，接二连三来的是省府的借故申斥。
    三十一年二月基干大会后，和我工作上协调的省府驻县视察委员和县分会主任一齐调换了，我感到事情有点不大妙。新任的省视委张继泉，县主任杨汝芝，一到汾城，就和政务秘书（有监视县长专责）贺廷玉，打击我在干部中的威信，牵制工作。最后竟鼓动警察局长率警他投。巡官马勇、卢象龙不愿胡闹，向我告密，我迅雷不及掩耳的把杨长健扣起，万想不到二层要员九专署的席竹虚等六人却一致联名攻击我。吉县专区战委会调有关人员检讨时，主委杨澄源在总结时竟偏袒起来。我恐怕受了陷害，跑到克难坡向阎锡山声诉。可巧，汾城战事发生，阎命我连夜回去帮助史泽波师长作战。拚死拚活的三个月又征了三个月的粮。“突击”、“检举”的声浪又鼎沸起来，我只好知难而退，托病辞职。回克难坡，阎锡山不见我。从此我逐渐的心灰意冷了。
    卅四年六月，又是征粮的时候。汾城指派了十万多石，超过历年的数字。这时，阎锡山又想到我了，要我去接任汾城总委会（负全县总责的机构）主委，这当然是希望我把十万多石粮顺手拿来。六月廿七日再到汾城，无分昼夜，从事征粮。谁知七月底汾城首先发现蝗虫，所有秋禾，全被蝗咬，勉强征到了六万多石，再也征不上了。我据情电报阎锡山，得到指示是“迅速卡紧征收。”我又详报老百姓已有饿死、逃亡、甚至上吊、投井的现象，吃的是蒿籽、豆渣、野菜，红薯成了上等饭。我曾和师长杨文彩轮赴各区召开祭刀大会（表示免开刀完成粮意思），把所有干部卡得跪在会长像前反省痛哭。虽然村村立下“自裁状”，而所收的效果仍甚微小。阎锡山申辩我是“危辞耸听、规避责任。”十一月间，我又以汾城灾情奇重，且历年征粮特多为辞，请求减免。但是，阎锡山并不采纳，随后来了一阵无中生有的“突击”、“检举”。查报结果是“事出不为无因，惟不易取得确凿证据。”这样，阎锡山就把我“撤职查办”了！
    从前常是自解自慰的这样想，我历次受到的惨重打击是由于是“同志会”文人组织的大派要吞并敌工团的小派，或可说梁化之要吃喝杨贞吉。现在我却完全醒悟了，阎锡山对干部根本有三套魔术：第一是“吸引笼络”，当认为你可以做他的奴隶和爪牙时，不惜降低他身份，装出来“和霭谦虚”、“平易近人”的态度先吸引住你。然后运用他那各种组织，把你网罗在“囚笼”里。第二是“逼下火坑”，当你表现了一定的作用时，恐怕你愿望上，思想上对他有不利的感触，他就给你个表面看来是很好的“权位”，实际上是逼你下火坑。第三是“笑里藏刀”，你在既下火坑以后，就只有照他衷心所指导的“对内绵如羊”，做个奴隶；“对外猛似虎”，做个爪牙。你如果听上他“关心民众疾苦”的违心之言，站在老百姓立场上喊喊叫叫，他就笑着脸皮夸奖你革命进步，管教你被无中生有的“突击”、“检举”、打得“皮破血流”、“体无完肤”。稍一不慎，就会走入枉死城。我个人的全盘经历，就是明证。我想任何在过阎锡山手下人的经历，也可以证明。这本是反动统治阶级一贯的心传，必然的手段，不过，阎锡山更其阴毒奸险罢了。
