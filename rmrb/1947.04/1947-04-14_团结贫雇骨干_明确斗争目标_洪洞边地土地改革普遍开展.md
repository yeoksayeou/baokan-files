　　Unite Poor and Hired Peasant Backbone
    Clarify Struggle Goals
    Land Reform Universally Launched in Hongtong Border Area
    [This newspaper's Taiyue dispatch of the 11th] Land reform in the second district of Hongtong, located in the area bordering the enemy, has been universally launched. At present, with the exception of the Jiang army's point and line villages such as Xia Lu and Yuanshang, land distribution has been completed in eight of the remaining twenty-five villages, seven villages are in the process of averaging the fruits, and nine villages are in the midst of struggle. The rapid progress of the land reform movement in this district is mainly due to the following points: First, the struggle goals were clearly defined from the beginning. For example, in villages such as Beigua, Anzi, and Lijiagua, the question was raised from the outset: Who should be struggled against? After deliberation, everyone clarified that they should struggle against the big despotic landlords, and as a result, the movement did not take a detour. Second, the backbone role of poor peasants and the solidarity with middle peasants were clarified. Villages such as Guadi, Guluo, and Sanling emphasized taking poor peasants as the backbone and uniting the broad masses of middle peasants, breaking with the past practice of cadres monopolizing the work, which greatly promoted the movement.

　　团结贫雇骨干
    明确斗争目标
    洪洞边地土地改革普遍开展
    【本报太岳十一日电】处于接敌区的洪洞二区，土地改革已普遍开展。目前除下鲁、原上等蒋军点线村庄外；其余二十五村中已有八个村土地分配完竣，七个村正进行匀果实，九个村正在斗争中。该区土地改革运动之所以如此迅速，主要是做到了以下几点：第一、开始便明确了斗争目标。如北卦、安子、李家卦等村，开始便提出：该斗谁？经过酝酿，大家弄清了应当斗大恶霸大地主，因而运动未走弯路。第二、明确了贫农骨干中农肉。如卦底、古罗、三岭等村强调以贫农为骨干，团结广大中农，打破了过去干部的包办作风，对于运动起了很大的推动作用。
