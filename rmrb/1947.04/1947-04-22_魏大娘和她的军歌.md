Grandma Wei and Her Military Songs
沈容

In Fan County, there is an illiterate Grandma Wei, who is 65 years old this year. She has created many allegro poems and often recites and sings them to people. When the Chiang troops began their large-scale offensive against the Liberated Areas last year, she sang:

The Eighth Route Army, virtuous in conduct,
Overthrow Chiang Kai-shek for peace.
Chiang Kai-shek sells the country and wages civil war,
The peasant folks suffer,
Having endured years of Japanese devils' oppression,
Still no peace until now.
Big villages and small villages hold meetings,
Every household provides militiamen;
The old troops lead the fight,
Charging forward with artillery;
Men and women, young and old, all pitch in,
Holding pitchforks and brooms in their hands;
Men go to the front to fight,
Women take on the work in the rear,
Old mothers, not good for much,
Boil tea and water in the middle.
The Eighth Route Army, comes to fight,
Wins every battle it fights.
Struggling and shedding blood to fight him,
Overthrow Chiang Kai-shek for peace,
Everyone shares the blessings,
A joyful and peaceful time.

Grandma Wei calls her works military songs. Because her eldest son sacrificed his life in the Eighth Route Army, she said, "Now I regard the Eighth Route Army as my own son. I compose military songs when I miss my son."

Her works all take realistic themes. At the end of January this year, Chiang's Fifth Army occupied Fan County, but only stayed for one night, doing evil for one night, before being driven away by the Eighth Route Army. Grandma Wei then composed a song called "Beating the Central Government Until It Can't Stop," she sang:

Old Chiang sells land and people, sending people to make a fuss,
Sending troops to fight, the villagers old and young do not approve;
The Eighth Route Army, so mighty, countless artillery pieces big and small.
First the traitors were beaten away, beating the "Central Government" until it cannot settle.
The "Central Government" occupied Fan County, the people suffered all night long,
Saying the wrong thing will get you shot, saying the wrong thing will get you hurt.
They ate and drank whatever they wanted, and even framed people before they left,
The Eighth Route Army came and people complained, the people loved the Eighth Route Army.
Men and women, old and young, protect him, a crowd of women praise him.

She teaches singing at any time to encourage others to support the army. Recently, passing through Fan County, I saw a group of women surrounding her. She sang very fluently, with ups and downs, adding facial expressions, and coordinating hand movements, attracting many passing women. Many people come to her to learn songs. There are women from more than ten miles away, and also cadres from the women's association. When the army passes by, some people come to copy her songs. She composes and teaches tirelessly every day.

She composed her first song during the New Year one year when the Eighth Route Army performed stilt walking and opera in Fan County. She was very happy to see it, and went back and composed a song, using the old tune of singing the twelfth month, mostly describing the peaceful life in the Liberated Areas. Now she composes more and more, and better and better, no longer sticking to any form.

    魏大娘和她的军歌
    沈容
    范县城里有一位不识字的魏大娘，今年六十五岁了，她创作了许多快板诗歌，经常给人念唱。去年蒋军开始大举进攻解放区的时候，她唱道：
    八路军，好德行，
    打倒老蒋得太平。
    老蒋卖国打内战，
    苦了庄稼老百姓，
    受尽鬼子几年气，
    直到如今没和平。
    大庄小村来开会，
    家家户户出民兵；
    老部队来领着打，
    带着大炮向前冲；
    男女老少齐下手，
    杈把扫帚拿手中；
    男的前方去打仗，
    后方工作妇女担承，
    老妈妈，不中用，
    烧茶烧水在当中。
    八路军，来打仗，
    打下一仗胜一仗。
    拚命流血和他打，
    打倒老蒋有和平，
    有福都叫大家享，
    太平年月喜洋洋。
    魏大娘把她的这些作品叫做军歌。因为她的大儿子参加八路军牺牲了，她说：“我现在把八路军当作自己的儿子，我想念儿子的时候就编军歌。”
    她的作品都采取现实的题材。今年一月底，蒋家第五军侵占了范县，但是仅仅住了一晚，作了一晚的恶，就给八路军赶跑了，魏大娘又编了一首歌，叫做“打得中央不能停”，她唱道：
    老蒋卖地又卖民，派了人来闹烘烘，
    派了军队来打仗，庄稼老少不赞成；
    八路军，好威风，大炮小炮数不清。
    先把汉奸打走了，打的“中央”不能定。
    “中央”占了范县城，老百姓受苦一夜整，
    说得不好要枪毙，再说错了要伤身。
    吃了喝了不要紧，临走还把人来坑，
    八路军来了诉怨恨，老百姓爱护八路军。
    男女老少把他保，一众妇女把他捧。
    她随时教唱，推动别人来拥护军队。最近经过范县，看见一群妇女围着她。她唱的很流利，抑扬顿挫，加上脸部的表情，配合手的动作吸引了很多走过的妇女。来她这里学歌的人真不少。有十几里以外的娘们，也有妇女会的干部。军队路过，也有人来抄她的歌子。她每天就这样不疲倦的编着，教着。
    她第一次编歌是在有一年的新年里，八路军在范县演高跷，唱戏，她看了很高兴，回去就编了一个歌，用的是唱十二月的老格调，大部分是描述解放区的和平生活的。现在越编越多，越编越好，已不拘什么形式了。
