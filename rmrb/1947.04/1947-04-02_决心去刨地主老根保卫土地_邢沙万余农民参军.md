Determined to Uproot the Landlords and Defend the Land:
	Over 10,000 Farmers in Xingtai and Shahe Join the Army

[Reported by this newspaper] In the Xingtai New District, the emancipated farmers, under the slogans of "Join the Victorious Army, Uproot the Landlord Class," and "Cadres Take the Lead in Emancipation, Take the Lead in Joining the Army, Defend Chairman Mao, Defend the Land," are filled with victorious confidence. Everyone resolutely advocates fully preparing strength and seizing the opportunity for counter-offensive. Therefore, in two days, over five thousand young adults from six districts registered to join the army. After strict review by the district and county, two thousand three hundred and seventy-four were formally enlisted. Zhao Xiaofeng from Luocun mobilized her husband to join the army. Initially, her husband was unwilling. She said, "During the famine years, we had nothing to eat or drink. Nobody cared whether we lived or died. Today, Chairman Mao led us to emancipation, but you are ungrateful. If we don't defeat Chiang Kai-shek, do you think we can live well? A real man dies at the stove or rots behind it – how unpromising! Defeating Chiang Kai-shek is glorious and beneficial, much better than staying at home. Don't worry, I will take good care of the family." Finally, she moved her husband, and he registered. Xu Chen, an old lady of sixty or seventy from Lidao Village, mobilized her only son to join the army. She said, "In Chiang Kai-shek's world, the wealthy can live well. In Chairman Mao's world, our poor people are doing well. I never dreamed of today's good fortune. Son, go join the army and resist Chiang Kai-shek so he can't come back!" Feng Huni, a nine-year-old child from Xinchang Village, mobilized her father, Zhao Guichen, saying, "Dad, go join the army. Fighting Chiang Kai-shek is important. Mom and I will do the work at home. You can come back after the victory!" Wang Zhenggang from Sanyi Temple was selling homespun cloth outside. Upon hearing about joining the army, he ran back, discussed it with his wife, and stopped selling the cloth to enlist. The vice-chairman of the Dase Women's Rescue Association had no one in her husband's family who could join the army, so she rushed back to her parents' home to persuade her two brothers to enlist. The village heads of Yangcun and Xinchang Village both mobilized their brothers to join the army, saying, "Emancipation is our own business, and defending it is even more so. If we don't go, who will?" Under the slogans of "Small Villages Form Squads, Large Villages Form Platoons" and "Take the Lead in Joining the Army, Perform Meritorious Service for the People," the cadres played the role of the locomotive. Under the leadership of the armed cadres in Dashitou Village, all one hundred and three young adults in the village registered to join the army. In Yangfan, the village head and chairman of the military committee led over one hundred young adults to join the army. Seventy or eighty people also registered in Shipotou. The chairman of the military committee of Yangcun, the instructor of Dase, the village head of Xicai Suncun, and the chairman of the farmers' association of Luocun all led forty or fifty people to register for the army. Every cadre expressed: "In the village, we took the lead in fighting the little Chiang Kai-sheks. This time, we take the lead in joining the army to fight the big Chiang Kai-shek, eradicate the roots of the landlord class, and perform meritorious service for the people. In the emancipation movement, we are emancipation heroes; on the front lines of joining the army, we must be killing-enemy heroes!" Finally, each village held a get-together. New soldiers swore to the masses, "We will not go home until we defeat Chiang Kai-shek." Cadres and the masses also made a guarantee to the new soldiers: "We will definitely take good care of the military families." (Yang Ziping)

[Reported by this newspaper] In order to expand the counter-offensive forces, strive for complete victory, eradicate the roots of the spies and landlords, defend Chairman Mao, and defend the land, Shahe has launched a military recruitment competition; in less than three days, 1,750 young people from the county joined the main force. (The number of Shahe enlistments reported on page 2 of this newspaper on March 24 was a mistake regarding the number of registrations.) After the land reform in Shahe, the masses' class consciousness has greatly improved, and they have realized that the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries are the backing of the feudal landlords. Unless the Chiang army is resolutely wiped out, the fruits of emancipation cannot be guaranteed. Therefore, in less than three days, 5,148 young adults volunteered to join the army. In order to take care of production labor, the county government, after inspection, allowed only 1,750 to remain; the rest were told to return home to production. Everyone was unwilling, saying in unison: It is necessary to resolutely defeat Chiang Kai-shek and never let him be the backing of feudal landlords and bullies. They resolutely refused to go home. After District Chief Wang and Political Commissar Zhang of the Fourth District persuaded them and got their ideas across, they reluctantly returned. This military recruitment was unprecedentedly enthusiastic. The director of the Du Women's Rescue Association persuaded her husband to go to the front line; Peng Yong, a woman from Xinzhuang, persuaded her son to go to the front line; the directors of the Women's Rescue Associations of Sizhuang and Shiliting persuaded their sons to go to the front line; Guo Rong persuaded her husband to go to the front line; Xiaoma Village proposed a military recruitment competition; Jiao Xiwu and Yin Yukui persuaded their sons to go to the front line; many women in Gaodian registered their husbands for the front line; many situations such as wives sending off husbands and fathers sending off sons occurred in Gaodu Village, and villages such as Beichang, Zanyi, Xinzhang, and Xincheng were all competing to join the army. In the Fifth District, 120 people from Liuke Village registered to join the army overnight. Mai Xiu, the director of the Women's Rescue Association of the village, immediately registered at a meeting in the district and guaranteed to mobilize her husband to join the army. Eighty young adults from Dongbeiliu joined the army overnight. Shen Xuedan, the militia captain and village head of Shen Village in the Third District, automatically registered. He had five brothers, all of whom were militia, and all of them joined the People's Liberation Army. He said to their mother, "Your sons all joined the People's Liberation Army. This is your glory." This mother said at a mass meeting, "In the past, we had no house or land, and we had little to eat or wear. Now, the Eighth Route Army led by Chairman Mao has emancipated us, and I can never repay their kindness. I only raised a few boys, and they all went to join the Eighth Route Army, first to repay the kindness of the Eighth Route Army and Chairman Mao, second to defend my good time of emancipation, and third to liberate the old people in the Chiang-controlled areas so that farmers all over the world can live a good life like in the liberated areas. This achieves three merits and three virtues." Under this influence, twenty-four young adults in the whole village automatically registered within a few hours. The militia captain of Kangchuan Village in the Second District had refused to join the army several times in the past, but this time he voluntarily registered to join the army to defend his own emancipation, and he led twelve militiamen from the whole village to join the army. He said at a mass meeting, "I didn't understand it when you asked me to join the army in the past, but now I understand. If we don't defend the fruits of emancipation ourselves, who will defend them? If we don't eliminate the spy furnace (referring to Chiang Kai-shek), emancipation will never be guaranteed." (Wan Ying, Chang Jun)

    邢沙万余农民参军
    【本报讯】邢台新区翻身农民在“参加胜利军、刨倒地主老根”“干部带头翻身，带头参军，保卫毛主席，保卫土地”的口号下，全体翻身农民充溢着胜利信心，大家坚决主张要充分准备力量，抓住反攻火候。所以在两天内，六个区青壮年报名参军即达五千多名。经区县严格审查，正式入伍有二千三百七十四名。洛村赵小凤动员男人参军，开初男人不愿意，她说：“过灾荒年没吃没喝，饿死饿活没人管，今天毛主席领导咱翻了身，你倒忘恩负义了；你想一想不打垮老蒋能过不能过？大丈夫男子汉，死在锅前，烂在锅后，多么没出息！打败老蒋有名有利多光彩，不比在家强？你放心，我一定把家照顾好。”终于把她男人感动的报了名。李道村许陈氏六七十岁老太婆，动员独子参军，他说：“老蒋世道，财主们能过；毛主席世道，咱们穷人光景好了。做梦也没想到有今天这光景，孩子去参军吧，抵住老蒋世道不让他再来！”心长村九岁儿童冯虎妮动员父亲赵贵臣：“爹，参军去吧，打老蒋要紧，家里活我和俺娘干，胜利了你再回来！”三义庙王振岗正在外卖土布，听说参军，跑回来和老婆一商量，土布不买了，参了军。大色妇救会副主席婆家没有能参军的人，急忙跑回娘家劝自己两个兄弟参军。羊村心长村长都动员兄弟参军，并说：“翻身是自己事，保卫翻身更是自己的事，咱不去叫谁去呢？”在“小村班、大村排”、“带头参军，为人民立功”等口号下，干部起了火车头作用。大石头庄武装干部带头下，全村一百零三名青壮年报名参军，羊范在村长武委会主任带领百余青壮年参军，石坡头也报了七八十名。羊村武委会主任、大色指导员、西彩孙村长、洛村农会主席，都带领四五十名报名参军，干部个个表示：“在村带头斗争小老蒋，这次带头参军打大老蒋，拔掉地主老根，为人民立功。翻身运动中是翻身英雄，参军上前线须要做杀敌英雄！”最后，各村都召开联欢大会，新战士向群众宣誓：“不打败老蒋不回家。”干部群众亦向新战士提出保证：“一定把军属照顾好。”    （杨子平）
    【本报讯】为扩大反攻力量，争取全面胜利，刨掉特务根、地主根，保卫毛主席，保卫土地，沙河掀起参军竞赛运动；不到三天，全县青年一千七百五十人参加主力军。（三月二十四日本报第二版沙河参军入伍人数为报名人数之误。）沙河经过土地改革后，群众阶级觉悟大大的提高了，认识到蒋介石反动派是封建大地主的后台，不把蒋军坚决消灭干净，翻身果实就得不到保障。因此，不到三天五千一百四十八名青壮年自报奋勇的参军。该县政府为了照顾生产劳力，检查后除一千七百五十名外，剩下的仍要他们回家生产。大家不愿意，异口同声的说：要坚决打败蒋介石，永不让它给封建地主恶霸做后台。坚决不肯回家。后经四区王区长张政委说服打通思想，才勉勉强强的回去了。这次参军空前踊跃，杜＠妇救主任劝丈夫前上线；新庄妇女彭用的劝儿上前线，寺庄、十里亭妇救会主任劝儿上前线，郭荣的劝丈夫上前线；马庄小村提出参军竞赛，焦锡五、尹玉魁劝儿上前线；高店很多妇女替男人报名上前线；高庄妻送夫、父送子等等情形很多，北常、赞义、新掌、新城等村，都是争先恐后的参军。五区留客村一夜报名参军一百二十名，该村妇救会主任麦秀在区开会立即报名保证动员他丈夫参军。东北留一夜八十青壮年参军。三区申庄民兵队长兼村长申雪旦自动报名，他共弟兄五人都是民兵，全部参加人民解放军。并对他们母亲说：“你养的儿子都参加人民解放军，这是你的光荣。”这位母亲在群众大会上说：“咱过去没房子没地，少吃没穿，现在毛主席领导的八路军叫咱们翻了身，真叫我报不完的恩情。我只养了几个小子，都去参加八路军，一为报八路军毛主席恩情，二为保卫我的翻身的好时光，三为解放蒋管区老百姓，使天下农民都像解放区这样过好日子。达到三功三德。”在这影响之下，全村青壮年几小时内自动报名二十四名。二区康川村民兵队长过去几次大家动员他参军他死也不去，这次为了自己翻身自己保卫自动报名参军，并带全村民兵十二人参军，他在群众大会上说：“过去叫我参军我思想不通，现在我可通了。翻身果实自己不去保卫叫谁去保卫？不消灭特务炉（指蒋介石）翻身永远没有保证。”
