　　Plant Trees Around Qingming Festival
　　Plant More Burnet
　　Burnet (also known as Wangan root) bark is a major auxiliary material for papermaking. It is planted in Shexian and Licheng areas of the Taihang District, but the yield is not very high. We suggest that all regions plant it in large quantities this year. This crop can be used for food and sold to paper mills. We hope that the masses in various places will plant it widely, and cadres at all levels will promote it.
　　Burnet is suitable for planting in sunny red sandy loam soil. It can be planted in large quantities along the edges of dikes. The distance between rows is two to three feet per plant, which does not hinder the main crops. For specific methods, you can ask the farmers.

　　Each Person Plants One Tree and Keeps It Alive
　　Now is the time for planting trees. If each person can guarantee to keep one tree alive, we will have a large number of trees growing in the entire border region. In a few years, they can become timber. It is best to plant more elm trees, because elm trees grow relatively quickly, and their branches, leaves, and bark are food in famine years.

　　清明前后多种树
    多种地榆
    地榆（又名莞根）皮是造纸的主要副料，太行区涉县黎城一带颇有种植，但产量并不多。我们建议今年各地大量栽种，这种作物既可供食用，又可卖给纸厂，希望各地群众广为种植，各级干部多多宣传推动。
    地榆宜栽于向阳的红沙粘土，地堰边尽可大量栽植，行间距离，每株二三尺远，不妨害正作物，具体办法，可向农民询问。

    一人栽活一棵树
    现在正是植树时期，如果每人能保证栽活一棵树，咱全边区就有很大一个数目的树生长起来，不几年就可成材。最好多栽榆树，因为榆树长得比较快些，它的枝叶和皮又是荒年的食品。
