Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, April 4th (delayed dispatch) The army and people of Eastern Chahar thoroughly crushed the "mopping-up" and "suppression" operations of Chiang Kai-shek's and Fu Zuoyi's troops, eliminating 1,500 enemies. In mid-December of last year, Chiang Kai-shek's and Fu Zuoyi's troops launched a large-scale invasion from Xuanhua, Huailai, and other areas along the Ping-Sui Railway into the Yanqing, Longguan, and Chicheng areas, attempting to destroy the Eastern Chahar liberated area in one fell swoop. After more than a month of hard fighting by our army and people in the area, they were thoroughly crushed by the end of January. During this period, the troops and militia in the area fought a total of 191 battles, attacked the Ping-Sui, Ping-Gu, and other highway transportation lines 72 times, killing, wounding, and capturing more than 1,500 of Chiang Kai-shek's and Fu Zuoyi's troops, and seizing a great deal of supplies. At present, most areas of the sub-district have restored democratic order, and Chiang Kai-shek's and Fu Zuoyi's troops are only trapped in a few isolated towns such as Longguan, Yanqing, Chicheng, and Diaoyu Fort. During the anti-"mopping-up" operation, the militia in the sub-district cooperated with the troops in combat extremely bravely. When Chiang Kai-shek's and Fu Zuoyi's troops attacked, the militia blocked and blew up roads everywhere, allowing them to advance only ten li per day. As soon as Chiang Kai-shek's and Fu Zuoyi's troops entered Diaoyu Fort, they fell into a minefield pre-set by the militia, detonating more than 30 landmines, killing and wounding more than 50 people. The militia on the outer lines attacked the enemy's transportation, and the Yanqing militia burned down a large bridge on the Yan (qing)-Yong (ning) highway.

　　察东歼敌一千五百余
  　蒋军被压缩于少数孤立城镇
    【新华社晋察冀四日电】（迟到）察东军民彻底粉碎蒋傅军“扫荡”、“清剿”，歼敌一千五百人。去年十二月中旬，蒋傅军自平绥线宣化、怀来等地，大举向延庆、龙关、赤城地区窜犯，企图一举摧毁察东解放区，经我该区军民月余奋战，已于一月底将其彻底粉碎。在此期间，该区部队、民兵共作战一百九十一次，向平绥、平古及其他公路交通线破击七十二次，毙伤俘蒋傅军千五百余人，缴获甚多。现该分区大部地区已恢复了民主秩序，蒋傅军仅困守龙关、延庆、赤城，雕鹗堡少数孤立城镇。反“扫荡”中，该分区民兵配合部队作战极为英勇，当蒋傅军进攻时，民兵到处阻击、爆炸，使其每日仅能前进十里。蒋傅军一入雕鹗堡，即陷入民兵预设之雷阵，踏响地雷三十余颗，死伤五十余名。外线民兵则击敌交通，延庆民兵并在延（庆）永（宁）公路上烧毁大桥一座。
