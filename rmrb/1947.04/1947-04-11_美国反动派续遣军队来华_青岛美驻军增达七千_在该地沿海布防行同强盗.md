　　American Reactionaries Continue to Send Troops to China
    US Garrison in Qingdao Increases to 7,000
    Deploying Defenses Along the Coast in the Manner of Robbers
    Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 5th – U.S. troops stationed in Qingdao are undermining Chinese sovereignty and the interests of the Chinese people. They have established defenses in various coastal ports and major streets of the city. Outside the city, in places like Cangkou and Xianjiasai, the U.S. military has headquarters, fortified with ten tanks and more than twenty artillery pieces. In the city, on Zhongshan Road, Taiping Road, Lushan Road, Guanxian Road, Dagang Road, Dagang Pier, Jiaozhou Road, and along the coastal ports, there are armed U.S. Marine Corps sentries who arbitrarily interrogate and make things difficult for pedestrians, effectively creating a concession. In early last month, nine more U.S. warships arrived in Qingdao, six of which were fully loaded with U.S. troops. It is estimated that the total number of U.S. troops stationed in Qingdao has reached more than 7,000. While the United States says it is reducing its troops in China, it is actually sending more troops to China, once again exposing the hypocritical and ferocious face of the imperialists.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 7th – The United States is again training special agents for Chiang Kai-shek. Forty Chiang army officers have arrived in the United States to study "police science" at various universities, colleges, and police departments. Thirteen of them are receiving training at the Detective Bureau of the Philadelphia Police Department. They will be sent back to China in October of this year to further implement the collusion between Chiang and the U.S. to suppress the patriotic movement of the Chinese people.

　　美国反动派续遣军队来华
    青岛美驻军增达七千
    在该地沿海布防行同强盗
    【新华社山东五日电】驻青岛美军破坏中国主权与中国人民利益，在沿海各港口及市内主要街道遍设防务。市外沧口、仙家塞等地有美军的总部，附坦克十辆，炮二十余门设防。市内中山路、太平路、嵝山路、冠县路、大港路、大港码头、胶州路及沿海各港口，均有持枪之美军陆战队岗哨，任意盘查留难行人，俨然成一租界。上月上旬又有美舰九艘抵青，其中六艘满载美军，估计驻青美军全数已达七千余人。美国嘴里说的是减少驻华军队，做的却是增派军队来华，又一次暴露了帝国主义者虚伪狰狞的面貌。
    【新华社陕北七日电】美国又替蒋介石训练特工人员。四十名蒋军军官已抵美，在各大学学院及各警务部研究“警察学”，其中十三名在费城警务部侦察局受训，他们将于本年十月间被遣送回国，以进一步实行蒋美合流，镇压中国人民的爱国运动。
