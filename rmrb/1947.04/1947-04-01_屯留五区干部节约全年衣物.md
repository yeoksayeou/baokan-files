　　Tunliu Fifth District Cadres
    Save a Year's Worth of Clothing
    [This newspaper, Taiyue, 30th] In Tunliu's Fifth District, the district chief, branch committee secretary, farmers' association chairman, militia committee chairman, and 17 administrative personnel from various systems, implementing the Central Bureau's instructions on practicing strict economy, voluntarily proposed not to receive a single pair of shoes, a single foot of cloth, a single cent of allowance, or any office expenses from the public this year. This totals savings of 332,900 yuan. They have all set good production plans. Li Zixian, Zhang Jingliang, and Wang Jinsuo are helping each other spin 22 jin of cotton. Wang Ronghua and Chen Qigong are helping each other make 22 pairs of shoes. Qin Quancheng announced that he would spend less time at home each day, laboring for liberated peasants, earning wages, and also deepening his leadership in mass production. Other comrades have also set out plans not to smoke paper cigarettes, not to dye summer clothes, not to use the clothing bureau for sewing, and not to keep their hair long, which will save another 300,000 yuan through production. The cook wants to raise pigs to earn money. They have also set out disciplines to ensure that production does not affect work, that they do not exploit others, and that their own labor is not speculative or opportunistic.

　　屯留五区干部
    节约全年衣物
    【本报太岳卅日电】屯留五区区长、分委书记、农会主席、武委会主席及各系统干部杂务人员十七人，执行中央局厉行节约指示，自动提出今年不领公家一双鞋一尺布一分津贴及办公费用。共计节约三十三万二千九百元。他们都订好生产计划，李子贤、张景亮、王金锁互助纺织棉花二十二斤，王荣花、陈起功互助做鞋廿二双，秦全成宣布每日少回家，给翻身农民劳动，赚工资又可深入领导群众生产，其他同志也订出不吸纸烟、夏衣不染颜色、不用成衣局缝、不留发等，这样又可生产节约三十万元。炊事员要喂猪赚钱。他们并订出纪律，做到生产不影响工作，不剥削别人，自己劳动不投机取巧。
