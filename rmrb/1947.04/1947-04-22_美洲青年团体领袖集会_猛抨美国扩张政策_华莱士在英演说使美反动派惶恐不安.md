Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 15th: TASS, Rio de Janeiro, reports: The People's Forum newspaper published a report on the work of the Conference of Leaders of American Youth Groups held in Cuba. The main task of this conference was to convene a meeting of youth groups and strengthen the ties between American youth and the World Federation of Democratic Youth. The main topic of the meeting stated: "The rulers of the United States—the big trusts and monopoly capital—are attempting to destroy the last remaining democracy and the sovereignty of the people of the Americas, so that the entire Americas becomes a colony of the United States, subjecting everything to the Americans' control, including food and raw material resources, attempting to turn the entire Americas into a US military base, and finally, together with its youth—due to Truman's plan, to participate in the entire US military, resulting in the youth inevitably becoming cannon fodder. The youth hate those who attempt to establish their world rule with new wars. American youth yearn to eliminate fascism, so in each country, they oppose Franco and his agents."

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 19th: TASS, 14th: Markov recently wrote in the New Era magazine that the American press predicts that a "new policy" of the United States in the Far East is about to be formally announced. However, the Far East policy that Washington is implementing already has all the characteristics of a "new policy." This "new policy" is currently estimated to be replacing international cooperation with unilateral and forceful plans. It can be said that the experience the United States has gained in the Far East (especially in China, where it has been and is helping the reactionary camp carry out an anti-people civil war) formed the basis for President Truman's plan of action in Greece and Turkey announced in his message on March 12, 1947. The article also stated: The United States has abandoned mediation, and in essence, is even more freely allowing the Kuomintang to expand the civil war. When the United States announced its withdrawal from China, it was further shirking its responsibility for the situation in China and the threat to world peace. At the same time, the United States is not giving up its interests in China, but is making China even more subordinate to it.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 17th: Washington: Former US Vice President Wallace has recently given several speeches in England, vehemently criticizing the US imperialist expansion policy and Truman's aid bill to Greece and Turkey, which has made American reactionaries deeply anxious and uneasy. Although Truman himself is trying to remain calm and keep silent, some reactionary congressmen, led by Vandenberg, have been clamoring loudly. The House "Committee on Un-American Activities" even passed a motion to indict Wallace for "attempting to persuade foreign governments to oppose American foreign policy." The reactionaries are also trying to persuade Truman to revoke Wallace's passport.

    美洲青年团体领袖集会
    猛抨美国扩张政策
    华莱士在英演说使美反动派惶恐不安
    【新华社陕北十五日电】塔斯社里约热内卢讯：人民论坛报刊载关于在古巴召开的美洲青年团体领袖会议的工作。此会议的主要任务是召集青年团体会议，并加强美洲青年与世界民主青年联盟的连系。会议的主要论题说：“美国的统治者——大托辣斯和垄断资本，——企图摧毁最后仅剩的民主和全美洲人民的主权，如此全美洲变成美国的殖民地，将其一切任从美国人支配，包括食品和原料的资源，企图将全美洲变成美国的军事基地，最后连同它的青年们——由于杜鲁门的计划，而参加全美军队，结果使青年们必然变成炮灰。青年们痛恨那些企图用新的战争建立他们对世界统治的人们，美洲青年渴望着肃清法西斯主义，所以在各国内他们均反对佛朗哥和他的代理人。”
    【新华社陕北十九日电】塔斯社十四日讯：马柯夫顷在新时代杂志著文称：美国报界预言美国远东政策之“新方针”即将正式宣布。然而华盛顿正在实行之远东政策，已具有“新方针”之一切特点。此“新方针”目前被估计为以片面及强力计划来代替国际合作。可以这样说：美国在远东所得到的经验，（特别是在中国的经验它曾经而且正在帮助反动阵营进行反人民的内战。）形成了杜鲁门总统在一九四七年三月十二日之咨文中所宣布的在希土行动计划的基础。该文并称：美国放弃了调停，而在实质上却更放手让国民党扩大内战。美国在宣布其自华撤退时，乃为正在进一步推卸对中国局势及威胁世界和平所负之责任。同时，美国谈不上放弃其在华之利益，而正在使中国更加受其支配。
    【新华社陕北十七日电】华盛顿讯：前美副总统华莱士，最近在英数度演讲。猛烈抨击美帝国主义扩张政策，及杜鲁门援助希土法案，已使美国反动派深感惶恐不安。杜鲁门本人虽力持镇静，保持缄默，但以范登堡为首的若干反动议员已大事叫嚣，众院“调查违反美国利益行动委员会”竟通过以“企图劝说外国政府反对美国外交政策罪”对华氏提出检举。反动派并图促使杜鲁门取消华氏护照。
