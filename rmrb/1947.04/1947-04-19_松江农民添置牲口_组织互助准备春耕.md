Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 15th -- As various areas here begin to thaw, the liberated peasants of Songjiang Province are stepping up preparations for spring plowing. The province has solved the problem of livestock shortages in many areas through the following three methods: First, using income from winter sideline production to purchase livestock. In the Chonghe area of Dongxing and Wuchang counties, 625 horses were purchased during winter logging production, and peasants in Shou County bartered woven mats and baskets for 30 horses; second, purchasing with government loans. Zhuhai County used 7 million yuan in loans from the Northeast Government Committee to purchase 250 horses uniformly by the county government and lent them to peasants for cultivation interest-free; third, closely linking land reform with the organization of spring plowing to eliminate "half-baked" work. Farmers in Lewu Village, Chengxiang District, Bin County, were allocated 13 horses and 16 cattle during the land investigation. In Heiyupao Village, 48 horses were obtained during the land investigation, while Zhang Village obtained a total of 23 mules and horses. At present, peasants in various areas are trying to finish delivering manure before the complete thaw and are starting to plow the land. Various forms of production organizations, work-exchange organizations, and new plowing methods are also constantly emerging. Cao Wenyou's group in Minzhu Village, Tudinzi Township, Bin County, organized a "everyone contributes a bowl of rice" plowing method, plowing the land of the three families in the group at the same time. In Xinglong West Village, Lalin County, 18 production teams were organized on a voluntary basis, using 20 hectares of land as the standard. Each team set its own production plan and competed with each other to ensure the completion of the task. Kaoshan Village, Donglin County, adopted a work-exchange scoring method, stipulating that a horse's work per day is recorded as 15 points, a cow's work as 13 points, and manual labor is also scored to encourage labor enthusiasm. In many villages and lands in other counties such as Yanshou, Shuangcheng, Mulan, and Wuchang, manpower and animal power have also been organized to complete the preparations for spring plowing.

　　松江农民添置牲口
    组织互助准备春耕
    【新华社东北十五日电】此间各地开始化冰解冻，松江省翻身农民，正加紧准备春耕。该省以下述三个办法，已使许多地区解决了畜力缺乏问题：第一是以冬季副业生产所得，添置牲畜。东兴及五常两县的冲河等区，在冬季伐木生产中，购马六百二十五匹，寿县农民编席筐换马三十匹；第二是政府贷款购买。珠河县以东北政委会七百万元贷款，由县府统一买马二百五十匹，无利贷予农民耕种；第三是在组织春耕中，密切联系土地改革，消灭“夹生饭”工作。宾县城厢区勒务村农民，在查地中分到了十三头马，十六头牛。黑鱼泡村查地中，获得四十八匹马，张村则得骡马共廿三匹。目前各地农民，要在完全化冻前把粪送完，并动手翻地，各种不同形式的生产组织、变工组织和新的插犋办法，亦不断涌现。宾县土顶子村民主屯曹文有小组，组织了“大家捧一碗饭”的插犋办法，将一组三家人的地，同时耕种。拉林县兴隆西村，以二十垧地为标准，自愿结合，组织了十八个生产小组，每组各订生产计划，互相竞赛，保证完成任务。东林县靠山屯，采用了换工记分法，规定马工每天记工十五分，牛工记十三分，人工也记分，以鼓励劳动情绪。其余如延寿、双城、木兰、五常等县很多庄地，也均将人工、畜力组织起来，完成春耕的准备工作。
