(Transmitted by: This Newspaper Taiyue, 7th) Jincheng and Yangcheng have achieved significant results by extensively absorbing women and children into agricultural mutual aid labor. In the past week, eleven villages including Tianshuiling, Nanping, and Dangpo have plowed more than 2,300 mu of land by women and children, overcoming the difficulty of lacking male labor in the rear. Some women and children have even completely mastered agricultural techniques. After the Yangcheng Chongshang Village women's night school discussed how liberated women should support the front lines, they bravely took on agricultural production in the rear, organizing ten mutual aid groups. The second time, twenty-three went to the fields, repairing @25 mu of land, padding @8.3 mu, and digging stubble on 18 mu in one day. In the mutual aid groups of six villages including Nanping, women account for five-tenths, and they have now plowed more than 1,400 mu of land, accounting for more than 70% of the total land. All the land can be cultivated in another three days.

(Transmitted by: This Newspaper Taiyue, 7th) The children of Anshang Village Primary School in Anze learn and produce in combination, studying and working part-time, which has won the praise of their parents. During the spring plowing last year, due to the lack of labor, Fan Chunyu, a teacher at the primary school, led seven students to organize a children's mutual aid group to help with family production. They studied for half a day and labored for half a day. Chopping thirty catties of firewood was counted as one work point, and fifteen catties was counted as half a work point, with each work point equivalent to two sheng of corn. Last year, in addition to studying, they chopped a total of 2,750 catties of firewood for their families, "forced" plowed five mu of land, pulled seedlings on five mu, and hoed seedlings on ten mu. On March 16th of this year, they convened another children's meeting to discuss restoring last year's mutual aid group. Everyone said in unison: "Last year we worked so hard, we are young and cannot go to the front lines, can't we still farm? Even if we can't match a good hand, we can match a second-rate one!" The next day they started working, carrying 300 loads of manure in five and a half days. All the parents praised them greatly. The number of people in the group has now more than doubled.

    【本报太岳七日电】晋城、阳城大量吸收妇女儿童参加农业互助劳动，获得显著成绩。天水岭、南坪、当坡等十一村，过去一周中妇女儿童犁地二千三百余亩，克服了后方男劳力的缺乏困难。有些妇女儿童并完全掌握农业技术。阳城崇上村妇女午校讨论了翻身妇女要支援前线后，她们勇敢的担负起后方农业生产，组织了十个互助组。第二次即有二十三个下地，一天中修地＠二十五亩、垫＠八亩三分，挖茬十八亩。南坪等六村互助组中，妇女占十分之五，现犁地一千四百余亩，占全数土地百分之七十以上，全部土地再有三天就可耕完。
    【本报太岳七日电】安泽安上村小学儿童，学习与生产结合，半工半读，得到家长赞扬。该村去年春耕时，因劳力缺乏，小学教员范纯玉便领导七个学生组织儿童互助组，帮助家庭生产。半日学习，半日劳动。打三十斤柴记一工，十五斤记半工，每工折玉茭二升。去年一年，除学习外，共为家庭打柴二千七百五十斤，“强犁”地五亩，拔苗五亩、锄苗十亩；今年三月十六日，又召集儿童会议，讨论恢复去年的互助组。大家异口同声说：“去年干的那么有劲，咱们年纪小，不能上前线去，还不能种地？顶不上个好把式，也顶个二把式！”第二日便开始劳动，五天半便担粪三百担，各家长均极赞扬。现该组人数已扩大一倍以上。
