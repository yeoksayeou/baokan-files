    Liberated Soldier Zhao Wenzhang
    Wins Merit Using the Cannon He Used in the Chiang Army
    [This newspaper's Yu-bei Front, 22nd dispatch] Comrade Zhao Wenzhang was liberated in the ×× battle. He quickly recognized the People's Liberation Army and joined it. The higher authorities issued a Type 92 infantry gun. As soon as the gun was pulled to the company, he immediately recognized that it was the one he had used in the "suffering army" (遭殃军，a derogatory term for the KMT army). He had used it to fire on the People's Liberation Army. He thought: I was wrong in the past, today I will use it to fight Chiang Kai-shek and make contributions to the people. This gun became his partner again. When the troops attacked the A-zhuang stronghold on the periphery of Qi County, two enemy pillboxes blocked the assault troops of our army. Zhao Wenzhang destroyed the two pillboxes with two shots. Then the troops rushed onto the roof of the enemy's house, but the enemy was still stubbornly resisting in the house. Zhao Wenzhang pushed the gun closer to the enemy's house, hitting it with two shots. The infantry rushed into the courtyard, and the stubbornly resisting enemy surrendered their guns. After the battle, the regimental mutual aid merit-making committee immediately recorded Zhao Wenzhang's first merit. (Liu Yonglu)

    被解放战士赵文章
    拿他在蒋军中用的炮立功
    【本报豫北前线廿二日电】赵文章同志是××战斗中解放过来的。他很快的认识了人民解放军并参加了人民解放军。上级发来一门九二式步兵炮，炮一拉到连上，他马上认出这是他在“遭殃军”中用的那一门。他曾用它对人民解放军发射过，他想：过去我是错了，今天我要用它打蒋介石，给人民立功，这门炮又成了他的伙伴。部队打淇县外围阿庄据点时，敌人两个暗堡阻住了我军的突击部队。赵文章两炮把两个暗堡打垮了。接着部队冲上了敌人的房顶，可是敌人还在房子里顽抗着。赵文章把炮推到离敌人房子更近的地方，两炮命中，步兵冲到院子里，顽抗的敌人缴了枪，战斗结束后，团互助立功委员会马上记了赵文章的一功。（刘永禄）
