Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, April 24th: A Xinhua News Agency reporter reported on the Chiang government's reorganization, saying:

　　Under the direction of American imperialism, Chiang Kai-shek's "reorganization of the government" this time is full of ugly performances. The "Organizational Law" and "Administrative Program" of this government have not even completed the so-called legislative procedures stipulated by the Kuomintang itself, but they have already been promulgated on the 18th, and even the "government" candidates have been determined. This caused Wang Puhan of the "CC" clique to make a big fuss in the so-called National Political Council, demanding discussion, otherwise it would be undemocratic. Chiang Kai-shek quickly sent Zhang Lisheng to explain, asking the "CC" elements to understand that the present time is a "difficult hurdle", so they had to rush to "reorganize the government", and even notifying them to let this so-called "public opinion organ" discuss it was too late to do. After this explanation, the "public opinion organ," the National Political Council, was surprisingly silent and no longer clamored for "democracy." When the so-called "Organizational Law" of this "government" was promulgated, it originally stipulated that the chairman of the government would be produced by the Central Committee of the Kuomintang and be responsible to the Central Committee of the Kuomintang. This then aroused internal quarrels among the reactionaries, saying that since other parties are participating in the government, and since it is said that the one-party dictatorship of the Kuomintang is abolished, it cannot be stipulated in this way. Otherwise, wouldn't it still be a one-party dictatorship? Chiang Kai-shek quickly agreed to amend it. The result of the amendment was: the chairman of the government is produced by the Central Committee of the Kuomintang, but is not responsible to the Central Committee of the Kuomintang, nor is he responsible to anyone else. Therefore, this government has become a government that is fundamentally not responsible to anyone, a strange and irresponsible government. This so-called "democratic government," which is neither legal nor responsible, was originally scheduled to be sworn into office on the 23rd, and then the problem came again. How to swear? To swear allegiance to the Kuomintang? Or to swear allegiance to something else? The opinions within the reactionary faction were again inconsistent. In order to quickly reorganize according to the wishes of the foreign daddy, they had to temporarily cancel the oath and take office without being sworn in. The combination of three groups of foxes and dogs and a group of so-called "social elites" was thus hastily united with the Kuomintang without even holding a wedding ceremony. A newspaper commented on this "reorganization of the government" saying: the Kuomintang is giving out porridge, and the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party are begging for food. Another newspaper said: the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party are escorts, sharing the spoils. Indeed, these two parties are extremely pitiful. The chairman and vice-chairmen, the heads of the five Yuan, and important departments such as the Ministry of Interior, Foreign Affairs, National Defense, and Finance in the reorganized Chiang government are all in the hands of the Kuomintang; the Minister of Transportation is Yu Dawei, who is a confidant of Chiang Kai-shek, Chen Cheng, and American imperialism, but is counted as a "social elite." The Democratic Socialist Party did not get a single ministry, and the Youth Party got the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, which have always been used to place idlers. Such a little bit of porridge given to a group of begging ghosts from the Democratic and Youth parties aroused a dispute over the porridge, and a storm of Tang Xiangming opposing Zhang Junmai occurred within the Democratic Socialist Party. The party was originally allocated four seats on the National Government Committee, but because of internal disputes, it has now only nominated three, and one has not been nominated to this day, making the list of the Chiang government incomplete and extremely ugly. Xu Fulin of the Democratic Socialist Party told reporters that the Democratic Socialist Party is willing to help Chiang Kai-shek, but the National Government Committee member is just an empty title and has nothing to do. "To help, you have to have something to do," probably wanting to grab a ministerial position. It is said that the Democratic Socialist Party is in danger of splitting because of the uneven distribution of spoils. Now that the government is in power, it is not known when this kind of farce will end. The general public opinion of the people in the Kuomintang-controlled areas about this "government" is: this government is a joint tutelage of the three parties, but it is actually borrowing foreign debts and fighting a civil war. Zhang Qun, the darling of the American reactionaries, made it very clear in his inaugural broadcast: to continue Chiang Kai-shek's "effective military measures against the CCP" and seek a "complete solution." However, Zhang Qun could not help but show his extraordinary panic. In his broadcast speech, he repeatedly mentioned the "serious crisis." He called on the reactionaries to unite as one to save Chiang Kai-shek's dying fate, like a badly wounded beast letting out a miserable wail.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, April 25th: TASS reported: After a long period of bargaining with the so-called minor parties, the Chinese government has been "reorganized" by the Kuomintang. The "National Government Committee" consists of seventeen members of the Kuomintang, four from the Youth Party, four from the Social Democratic Party (i.e., the Democratic Socialist Party), and four non-party members. The council has appointed an Executive Yuan with twenty-seven ministers. All important ministers are still in the hands of the Kuomintang, while other parties and non-party members are given secondary ministers. It is worth noting that the list of non-party leaders submitted to the National Government Committee was privately approved by Chiang Kai-shek, while representatives of the broad masses of the people are not recognized. The Democratic League and the Communist Party have refused to participate in the "reorganized" government, because the purpose of this "reorganization" is nothing more than to perpetuate and legitimize the Kuomintang's dictatorial position. Most members of the Democratic Socialist Party blamed their party leader Zhang Junmai for privately deciding that the party would participate in the government. According to the Dagong Bao, most prominent democrats issued a declaration, emphasizing that in essence, the newly "reorganized" government is still a one-party government of the Kuomintang, and the purpose of the reorganization is to obtain American loans to be used as military expenses for the civil war.

### 为了获得美国贷款继续内战  蒋政府扮演“改组”丑剧

　　为了获得美国贷款继续内战
    蒋政府扮演“改组”丑剧
    【新华社陕北二十四日电】新华社记者报导蒋政府改组的情形说：
    在美国帝国主义导演下，蒋介石此次“改组政府”，丑态百出。这个政府的“组织法”与“施政方针”，至今连国民党自己规定的所谓立法手续都没有完成，然而已经在十八日颁布了，而且连“政府”人选都已经定好了。因此引起“ＣＣ”系王普涵等在所谓国民参政会中大闹，要求讨论，否则就是不民主。蒋介石连忙派了张厉生前去解释，要那批“ＣＣ”分子懂得现在是一个“难关”，所以不得不连忙“改组政府”，连通知他们让他们这个所谓“民意机关”讨论一下，也没有来得及办到。经过这一解释，那个“民意机关”国民参政会居然就哑然无声，不再闹要“民主”了。这个“政府”的所谓“组织法”颁布时，原来规定政府主席由国民党中央委员会产生，并对国民党中央委员会负责。于是又引起了反动派内部的争吵说：既然有别的党参加政府，既然说废止国民党一党专政，就不能这样规定。否则岂不仍旧是一党专政？蒋介石连忙答应修改，修改的结果是：政府主席由国民党中央委员会产生，又不对国民党中央委员会负责，也不对别的什么人负责。因此这个政府就成了根本不对任何人负责的政府，成了一个希奇古怪的概不负责的政府。这个既不合法又不负责的所谓“民主政府”，原来预定于二十三日宣誓就职，于是问题又来了。怎样宣誓呢？宣誓服从国民党呢？还是服从别的什么呢？反动派内部意见，又不一致。为了依照洋爸爸的意思赶快改组起见，只好临时取消宣誓，不经宣誓就就了职。三个狐群狗党与一批所谓“社会贤达”的结合，就此连结婚典礼也没有举行便草草率率的偷上了国民党。有个报纸评论这次“改组政府”说：国民党是施粥，民社党青年党是讨饭。又有一个报纸说：民社党青年党是陪客、是分赃。的确，这两个党真是可怜已极，改组后的蒋政府里的正副主席、五院院长和重要的部门如内政、外交、国防、财政等部，都在国民党手里；交通部长是俞大维，这是蒋介石、陈诚和美帝国主义的亲信，但却算在“社会贤达”的账上。民社党连一个部也没分到，青年党得到向来用以安插闲杂人员的经济、农林两部。这样一点点粥施给民、青两党的一群讨饭鬼，就又起了抢粥的纠纷，民社党里发生了汤芗铭反对张君励的风波。该党本来分到国府委员四名，因为内部闹纠纷，现在只提出了三名，还有一名至今没有提出来，弄得蒋政府的名单残缺不全，极其难看。民社党的徐傅霖对记者说：民社党愿意帮蒋介石的忙，但是国府委员是个空名，没有事情做，“要帮忙就要有事情做”，大概想抢个部长做做。据说民社党因为分赃不匀，有分裂的危险。现在政府已经上台，但这类丑剧不知要到那天才能演完。国民党统治区人民对这个“政府”的普通舆论说：这个政府是三党共同训政，其实就是借外债、打内战。美国反动派的宠儿张群在其就职广播中说得很明白：要继续蒋介石的“对中共的有效军事措施”，求得“彻底解决”。然而张群也免不了显出自己的异常恐慌，在他的广播演说中三番四复的说到“严重的危机”，他号召反动派一致的团结起来，挽救蒋介石垂死的命运；像负了重伤的野兽发出了惨厉的哀号。
    【新华社陕北二十五日电】塔斯社讯：在与所谓小党派长时讨价还价后，中国政府已由国民党加以“改组”。“国府委员”计有国民党员十七名，青年党四名、社会民主党（即民社党）四名，无党无派四名。该会已指派有二十七名部长的行政院。所有重要部长仍掌握在国民党手中，而其它党派与无党人士则给以次要的部长。值得注意的是：提交国府委员会的无党派领袖名单曾经蒋介石私人批准，而广大人民的代表则不被承认。民主同盟与共产党均拒绝参加“改组”的政府，因这“改组”的目的，不外想使国民党的独裁地位永久化与合法化。民社党大部党员责备该党领袖张君劢私自决定该党参加政府问题。据大公报讯：多数著名的民主人士发表宣言，强调指出：本质上，新“改组”的政府仍系国民党一党政府，改组的目的是为了获得美国贷款，以作内战军费。
