Since the Jiang army concentrated its forces to attack the Jinpu Railway and northern Shaanxi, from the second half of March, except for using a small number of troops to "mop up" Wenxian and Boai counties south of the Daoqing Railway, it basically adopted a temporary defensive posture on the battlefield in this region. In order to ensure its defensive posture, Chiang Kai-shek disregarded the safety of millions of people's lives and property along the Yellow River and diverted all the Yellow River water back into its old course on March 15th, and occupied Dong'a, Pingyin, Feicheng, Dongping and other cities on the south bank of the Yellow River, building fortifications along the river in an attempt to prevent our main force from maneuvering. However, the Jiang army lacked troops, and the front line was vast, stretching over a thousand miles from Fenglingdu in the west to the Jinpu Railway in the east, exposing weaknesses everywhere. Our army launched the prelude to the Northern Henan campaign on March 29th. As of March 31st, our army had occupied the three county towns of Yanjin, Yangwu, and Yuanwu on the east side of the Pinghan Railway, and the key points of Daokou, Liangmen, Laowu, Shangguancun, Niushitun, Xiaodianzhen, and Guguzhai (all in the area east of Xinxiang and Jixian, south of Puyang, and west of Puyang); on the west side of the Pinghan Railway, our army occupied more than a dozen strongholds such as Chenbao, Lubao, Shanbiao (northwest of Xinxiang), Wucun, Wuliyuan, and Zhaogu (west of Xinxiang, north of the Daoqing Railway). The east and west pincers cut the Anyang-Yellow River Bridge section of the Pinghan Railway into several sections, captured five stations (Tagang, Luwangfen, Xiaoji, Kangcun, and Jixian Station), controlled about a hundred miles of railway, and destroyed two railway bridges (Qihe Bridge and Haohe Bridge), forming an encirclement of Xinxiang and Jixian. This offensive has made Gu Zhutong, Fan Hanjie, Wang Zhonglian, and Sun Zhen very flustered. Although the 76th Brigade and the Pre-2nd Brigade of the reorganized 9th Division (originally the reorganized 2nd Army, equipped with American weapons, and transferred north from Kunming in early February) and a part of the 66th Division have been rushed north from the south of the Yellow River, and the 49th Brigade and the 32nd Division have also gathered in Xinxiang and Jixian respectively, it is clear that the initiative of the war has been firmly grasped by us, and the battle situation is continuing to develop.
    Another characteristic of the operations in the second half of March was the more vigorous development of guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines, which effectively coordinated with the operations of the main force. First of all, in the Yuwansu area, since the reorganized 48th Division was transferred to the north of Xuzhou via Shangqiu on March 7th, although the Jiang army has established the Sixth Pacification Zone in Shangqiu, with Zhou Lei as the director to command the 64th Brigade, 183rd Brigade, the 2nd and 17th Traffic Police Corps, the remnants of Zhang Lanfeng's two regiments, and local local teams to continue their mopping-up operations against us, the soldiers and civilians of Yuwansu, who have been tempered by long-term warfare, are still actively attacking the enemy, and have crossed the New Yellow River, directly approaching the Xiaohan South Section, capturing Zhoujiakou on the 23rd, recovering Taikang on the 27th, and recovering Tongxu on the 30th, causing a great threat to the flanks of the Jiang army, providing effective support for the Northern Henan campaign.
    Secondly, our local troops in the Jiluyu area have penetrated deep behind enemy lines and recovered Chengwu. On the 15th, they ambushed vehicles north of Yanjin, capturing Gao Qiangbin, deputy brigade commander of the 117th Brigade, and 9 others, and wounding Chen Yuanxiang, political director of the 5th Pacification Zone, and 6 others. On the 17th, they ambushed an enemy transport team between Jinxiang and Jining, burning and capturing 23 vehicles, forcing the enemy to admit that the roads were unsafe and to stop the transport of military supplies and important war materials.
    In southern Shanxi, after the 55th Brigade of the 38th Division crossed the Yellow River westward from Yuncheng via Hejin, the Jiang-occupied area became even more empty. Although the 85th Brigade of the reorganized 10th Division, transferred from Sichuan, has taken over the task of that unit, our local armed forces have infiltrated the enemy's grid of defenses in various gaps and launched guerrilla warfare everywhere. A guerrilla group dispatched by the Anxia Independent Battalion alone achieved the result of capturing 29 enemy personnel below the rank of major and seizing 8 rifles in the week from the 11th to the 18th, which just shows the predicament of the Jiang army being trapped in points and lines under the encirclement of our guerrilla warfare.

　　豫北我军强大攻势序幕展开蒋军侵占区我游击战益猛烈
  　本区半月战况
  　三月十六日至三十一日
  　军区司令部
    蒋军集中兵力进攻津浦线及陕北，自三月下半月以来，除以小部兵力“扫荡”道清路南温县、博爱等地以外，对本区战场基本上暂采守势。为确保其防御态势，蒋介石不顾黄河沿岸数百万人民生命财产之安危，于三月十五日将黄水全部归入故道，并侵占黄河南岸之东阿、平阴、肥城、东平诸城，沿河构筑防御工事，企图阻止我大军机动。但蒋军兵力不足，战线辽阔，西起风陵渡，东到津浦线，千余里战线，处处暴露弱点。我军已于三月二十九日展开豫北作战之序幕，截至三月三十一日为止，我军已在平汉东侧占领延津、阳武、原武三座县城，道口、两门、老屋、上官村、牛市屯，小店镇、古固砦诸要点（均在新乡、汲县以东，濮阳以南以西地区）；平汉西侧我军则占领陈堡、鲁堡、山彪（新乡西北）、吴村、五里源、赵固（新乡以西，道清线以北）等据点十余处。东西钳，将平汉铁路安阳至黄河桥段切为数段，攻克车站五处（塔岗、潞王坟、小冀、亢村、汲县车站），控制铁路百里左右，炸毁铁桥两座（淇河桥、浩河桥），形成对新（乡）汲（县）两地的包围。这一次攻势已使顾祝同、范汉杰、王仲廉、孙震等手忙脚乱，虽然整九师（原第二军整编，美械装备，二月初由昆明北调。）的七十六旅、预二旅两个旅及六十六师一部均已自黄河以南仓皇北调，四十九旅、三十二师也分别在新乡、汲县集结，但显然的，战争的主动权已为我确掌，战局正在继续发展中。
    三月下半月作战的另一个特点，是敌后游击战争的更加猛烈开展，有力地配合了主力军的作战。首先在豫皖苏方面，自整四十八师于三月七日经商邱调徐州以北以后，虽然蒋军已在商邱设立第六绥区，以周磊为主任统一指挥，六十四旅、一八三旅、交警第二、第十七两个总队、张岚峰残部两个团以及当地地方团队继续向我扫荡，但我久经战争锻炼的豫皖苏军民，依然是以主动姿态向敌出击，且已越过新黄河，直逼小汉南段，二十三日攻克周家口，二十七日收复太康，三十日收复通许，使蒋军侧背感受极大威胁，对豫北作战以有力策应。
    其次，冀鲁豫我地方部队则已深入敌后收复城武，十五日在延津以北伏击汽车，俘敌一一七旅副旅长高强斌以下十人，整伤敌五绥区政治主任陈远湘以下七人。十七日又在金乡、济宁间伏击敌运输队，烧毁及缴获汽车二十三辆，使敌不得不自己承认道路不靖，停止军火与重要作战物资的运输。
    晋南方面，自三十八师五十五旅自运城经河津西渡后，蒋占区更形空虚。虽然由四川调来之整十师八十五旅已接替该部任务，但我地方武装已在各个空隙渗入敌后格子网，到处展开游击战争，仅安夏独立营所派出的一个游击小组，在十一日至十八日一周内，获得生俘敌少校以下二十九名、缴步枪八支的战果，正说明了蒋军在我游击战争包围下困守点线的窘境。
