　　Cadre-Masses Solidarity and Mutual Aid in Production
    Longmen Determined to Strive for Model Status
    [Our Newspaper, Xingtai News] Longmen Village in the Sixth District, under the leadership of Political Director Yin Ruxin and Village Head Han Tiande, began on the 12th and spent nine nights conducting a village-wide ideological review, rectifying mutual aid teams, and organizing women's spinning and weaving, bringing the entire village into the great production movement. During the review, cadres took the lead in examining themselves. Yuan Jiutang, vice chairman of the Farmers' Association, said: "Since I became vice chairman, I haven't picked up a single piece of firewood all winter, and I've been having my father-in-law pick it up for me." Village Head Han Tiande said: "Since I became village head, I've spent a lot of time on official duties. The masses in the team have done the work in my fields for me, and I haven't paid them back for their labor, so the masses are unwilling to cooperate with the cadres." Political Director Yin Ruxin has quit smoking cigarettes and no longer eats in restaurants, determined to lead the team in good production. Militia Captain Yuan Yucang said: "The collapse of the mutual aid team is due to the incorrect thinking of us cadres. In the summer, the masses helped us plant and cultivate our land, and we benefited from the masses. In the winter, we disliked the masses for being useless, and the cadres engaged in business with each other, and we did not share the profits with the masses. In the future, I will cooperate with the masses throughout the year and share the blessings." The exemplary actions of the village cadres moved the masses in each team to conduct self-criticism as well. Yin Ruheng said: "My family's Wu Ni is not even worth half a laborer, but I made him a full laborer, which made others unhappy." Yin Ruxin said: "I am a bit selfish and look down on Yin Ruheng's leadership. Instead of cooperating with him properly, I wanted to show off my own heroism." Hao Yugang said: "I am so lazy that I don't even want to lift four taels, and when asked to carry a load of water, I walked away groaning." After a general reflection, each team cleared its old accounts, and the entire village achieved unity, and the idea of getting rich and building a family was universally enhanced. Cadres participated in each team, contributing as much labor as they were capable of, repaying debts, and not being special in any way. Out of more than 150 households in the village, 95 percent of the male full and half laborers have been reorganized into ten large and small mutual aid teams. All of the village's more than 500 mu of wheat fields have been hoed, and the irrigated wheat fields have been watered twice to prevent drought, and some have been watered three times. Yin Rujing, manager of the cooperative, is putting all his efforts into developing spinning and weaving, mobilizing the village's four carpenters to specialize in making spinning and weaving machines every day. Including purchases, there are already 15 looms. More than 20 new spinning wheels have been made, and there are a total of more than 50 including the old ones. A spinning and weaving training class has also been opened, with the cooperative providing food. Twelve skilled workers have been trained, and there are more than 30 women who can weave, including those who learned last year. Recently, six new spinning and weaving teams have been established, bringing the total to eight, and 70 percent of the women have been swept up in the spinning and weaving craze. Currently, all the cadres and masses in the village, men and women, old and young, are determined to create Longmen into a model village this year.

　　干群团结互助生产
    龙门决心争取模范
    【本报邢台讯】六区龙门村，在政治主任尹如信、村长韩天德领导下，于十二日开始，花了九夜的时间，进行全村思想大检讨，整顿互助组，组织妇女纺织，使全村卷入大生运动。检讨时，干部起带头作用，首先检讨自己。农会副主席袁九堂说：“我当副主席后，一冬天没有拾一根柴，光叫俺丈人给拾。”村长韩天德说：“我当村长，耽误工夫多，组内群众给我把地里活做了，我也没还工，所以群众不愿意和干部互助。”政治主任尹如信已把纸烟戒了，也不去饭铺吃饭了，要决心带领小组好好生产。民兵队长袁玉藏说：“互助组垮台，都是咱干部思想不正确。夏天，群众给咱把地养种好，咱沾了群众的光。冬天，咱嫌群众不顶用，干部和干部做买卖，赚了钱也不给群众分。以后我要和群众互助全年，有福同享。”村干部这一模范行动，感动得各组群众也做了自我检讨。尹如恒说：“俺家五妮，本来连半劳力也不顶，我给他顶成全劳力，别人不高兴。”尹如信说：“我有点自私，看不起尹如恒的领导，不是跟他好好合作，想逞自己英雄。”郝玉刚说：“我懒的连四两重也不想拿，叫担一担水吧，我哼哼地走了。”经过普遍反省，各组把旧账算清，全村做到了团结，发家致家的思想普遍增强。干部参加到各个组内，有几分劳力顶几分劳力，欠工还工，一点也不特殊。全村一百五十余户，百分之九十五的男全半劳力重新组织起来，大小互助组十个，全村五百多亩麦地已锄完，水地麦子为了防旱，都浇了两遍，有的已浇三遍。合作社经理尹如镜，全力放在开展纺织上，把村里四个木匠动员出来，每天专门打纺织机，连买带打已有十五架织布机，新打了二十多架纺车，加上旧的共有五十余架。又开纺织训练班，合作社供给伙食，已训练出十二个成手，加上去年学会的共有三十多个妇女会织了。近又新成立了六个纺织小组，加上旧有的共八个，百分之七十妇女已卷入纺织热潮。现全村干部群众，男女老少，都抱着最大决心，今年要把龙门创造成模范村。
