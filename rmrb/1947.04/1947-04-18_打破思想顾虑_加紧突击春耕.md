　　Break Through Ideological Concerns
    Intensify the Spring Planting Campaign
    The tense season of spring planting and sowing has now arrived. However, a noteworthy problem at present is that some farmers have production-related concerns—such as fearing being "cut down like韭菜 [chives, meaning exploited]," fearing getting rich, etc.—which are hindering the rapid rise of a production upsurge. We must pay attention to breaking through these concerns and removing this obstacle. Today's news from Yuanqu in She County provides an important experience in this regard—that is, first establish the idea that poor and hired peasants should become wealthy, and with them as the backbone, combined with practical actions, launch a mass movement to unite middle peasants to participate in production. This approach has been effective and powerful, and is one of the good methods suitable for the current practical situation.
    During the land reform movement, various places already had the experience of uniting middle peasants with poor and hired peasants as the backbone, thereby powerfully promoting the advancement of the movement. We believe that applying this method to launching a large-scale production movement is of equal importance. We should encourage the poor and hired peasants who have turned over a new leaf to bring their full enthusiasm for liberation to large-scale production, and pay attention to using facts to break through the concerns of some middle peasants about being cut down like韭菜 [chives, meaning exploited] or fearing getting rich, implement unity in emancipation and unity in production, and truly create a movement with a broad mass base.
    The urgent spring planting task is already before us. We must act quickly, rectify and develop mutual aid, and intensify the work of plowing, transporting manure, and sowing.

　　打破思想顾虑
    加紧突击春耕
    紧张的春耕下种季节现已到来，但摆在当前一个值得注意的问题，是有一部分农民在生产上存在着顾虑——如怕“割韭菜”，怕发家……等问题，影响了迅速掀起一个生产热潮。我们必须注意打破这些顾虑，扫除这一障碍。今天涉县原曲的消息，在这个问题上提供了一个重要经验——即首先树立贫雇的发家致富思想，并以他们为骨干，结合实际行动，开展一个群众性的团结中农参加生产的运动。这个作法，收效迅速而有力，是适合目前实际情况要求的好方法之一。
    土地改革运动中，各地即已有过以贫雇为骨干团结中农，因而有力的推动了运动前进的经验，我们认为这个方法运用到开展大生产运动中，亦具有同样重要意义。应该鼓励翻了身的贫雇农，把翻身的充分热情，带到大生产中去，并注意用事实打破一部分中农怕割韭菜、怕发家等思想，贯彻团结翻身团结生产，真正造成一个有广泛群众基础的运动。
    紧急的春耕任务已摆在面前，我们要快快的行动起来，整顿与发展互助，加紧进行翻地送粪、下种等工作。
