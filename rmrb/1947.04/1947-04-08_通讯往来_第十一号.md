    No. 11
    Comrades Zemin, Yuxi, and Zhiquan: The Yangjiao cadres and masses' development of a "compare progress" movement is a new development and creation in correctly resolving cadre-mass relations and deepening the movement. It is hoped that a detailed account of the movement's development process, achievements, and main experiences will be compiled and sent. When compiling, please explain which cadres and masses were influenced by good cadres refusing to divide the fruits of labor, and thus voluntarily gave up excess land and houses? Has the distribution of the fruits of labor in the whole village truly achieved fairness and rationality? Has the land distribution achieved substantial equality? Please specifically describe the process of how this was achieved.

    泽民、玉喜、执全同志：羊角干群开展比进步运动，是正确解决干群关系深入运动的一个新发展新创造，希将运动开展经过事实，成果与主要经验详细整理寄来。整理时希说明有那些干部群众受好干部拒分果实的影响，而自动匀出多分土地房屋？全村果实是否已真正做到公平合理？土地分配是否已做到大体平均？请将如何做到的过程具体叙述出来。
