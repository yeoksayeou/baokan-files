Enlistment in Zhonghe Village, Changzhi

　　Zhonghe Village in Changzhi is a village of 161 households that thoroughly implemented "land to the tiller" after the new liberation. The village eliminated extreme poverty during the land reform movement. The masses are living a happy and joyful life, everyone is elated, and they are now carrying out a review and developing armed self-consciousness to defend their victory of land reform.

　　In this enlistment movement, a high degree of consciousness is demonstrated. Village cadres first discussed and clarified their thinking. Through small meetings, large meetings, and individual mobilization, eighteen young people enlisted in one day. During the discussion, the liberated masses consciously chose two topics: (1) Why are landlords' women marrying poor people now? Are they of one heart with the poor? An old man said, "Landlords have two or three hearts, how can they be of one heart with us?" Why do landlords have two hearts? After mass debates in small and large meetings, everyone agreed that landlords have two hearts because they are still fantasizing about their old root, Chiang Kai-shek. After discussing the root cause, everyone jointly proposed, "Overturning the small stone slab through land reform, expand the armed forces to overturn the big stone slab." Old man Wu Desheng, a military dependent, said, "Young people enlist to overturn the big stone slab, the elderly transport and produce in the rear. My eldest son has already enlisted, and I am now mobilizing my second child, Qingze, to enlist as well." Wang Hu, who is only fifteen years old, said, "What the old military dependent said is right, I want to defend the fruits of victory, I want to enlist." Zhang Erze, an old man in his fifties, said, "That's right, I am not old at fifty-something, Huang Zhong, the old general, can resist thousands of troops, I will also enlist to defend the fruits of victory." He Deming, an old military dependent, also said, "We have just turned ourselves around, we cannot let Chiang Kai-shek and the local bullies come and take away our pot, I will also enlist." The mother of He Hanyou heard that her son was going to enlist to defend the fruits of land reform, and said to others, "I didn't go to the meeting, I am rushing to make a good piece of clothing for my son at home."

　　In this enthusiastic wave of enlistment, large and small meeting places, streets, dining places, and families are all clamoring that enlisting to lift the stone slab and fight Chiang Kai-shek is everyone's business. The masses are rushing to invite the new soldiers to dinner. When registering for enlistment at the conference, Zuo Youcai asked the conference to clarify the number of registrants, ran to the cooperative and bought sixteen towels and two packs of cigarettes to give to the new soldiers. Military dependent Wu Desheng donated 800 yuan to the new soldiers. Old military dependent He Deming donated 700 yuan, and He Zhen, a poor military dependent who turned himself around this year, donated 1,000 yuan. He Xuezhe, a poor old man who sells casseroles, also donated 700 yuan. New and old military dependents are one family, without exception. Women donated more than 2,000 yuan of their private savings. The women were also holding meetings and busy sewing bedding rolls for the new soldiers at the meeting. Among the 161 households, 146 households automatically donated to the new soldiers, totaling 68,050 yuan, sixteen towels, six pairs of shoes, four pairs of socks, and two packs of cigarettes. The sincerity and enthusiasm of the masses gave great encouragement to the new soldiers.

　　Military dependent Wu Desheng said at the farewell meeting: "I have suffered hardship and oppression. Today, I have turned myself around and received preferential treatment and honor from the masses. I am very happy. I will work harder in production in the future and try my best to reduce the preferential treatment from the masses." The representative of the masses said: "The children of military dependents go to the front line, we the masses must take good care of the military dependents, so that the families of military dependents do not suffer difficulties, and support the front line. This is everyone's work." Women scrambled to put flowers on the new soldiers.

　　After the new soldiers left, cadres and women went to the homes of the new military dependents to comfort them. Old man Wu Desheng did not go home, but went to the home of Zuo Mi, a new military dependent, to comfort him. He met old man Zuo Sanxiao, a military dependent, who also went to Zuo Mi's home. Old man Wu Desheng said: "In the past, we suffered from hunger, but today we have turned ourselves around and received preferential treatment and honor. Our military dependents must do a good job in production and reduce the trouble to the village. This is the glory of military dependents." The three old men gathered together to talk happily, very excited. After the village cadres dispersed that night, they spun thirty catties of hemp rope, sorted out stretchers, and prepared to combine with the front line to lift the big stone slab and fight Chiang Kai-shek.

　　长治中和村参军记
    长治中和村是新解放后彻底实行了耕者有其田的一百六十一户的村子，该村在翻身运动中消灭了赤贫农，群众在过着幸福愉快的生活，个个兴高彩烈，现在正进行复查和开展武装自觉，保卫自己的翻身胜利果实。
    在这次参军运动中，表现着高度的自觉性，村干首先讨论搞通思想，在小会大会个别动员结合之下，一天内便有十八个青年参军。讨论会上翻身群众即自觉选择了两个题目：（一）地主妇女为啥现在嫁穷人？是否和穷人是一个心？一个老汉说：“地主有二心三心，怎也不能和咱是一个心。”地主为啥有二心？经过小会大会的群众争辩后，一致认为地主有二心是还在幻想着他的老根蒋介石。大家讨论追根的结果，共同提出“翻身揭了小石板，扩大武装揭大石板。”军属吴德胜老汉说：“青年参军去揭大石板，老年在后边运输生产，我大儿已参军，我现在动员我二孩青则也去参军。”王虎只是个十五岁的孩子，说：“老军属说的对，我要保卫胜利果实，我要去参军。”五十多岁老汉张二则说：“对，我五十多不算老，黄忠老将挡千军，我也去参军保卫胜利果实。”和德明老军属又说：“咱刚翻了身，不让蒋介石恶霸再来端走咱的锅，我也参军去。”民兵班长左兴发说：“我弟兄争着去，开了个家庭会议，决定三弟先去参军。”和韩有母亲听说儿子去参军保卫翻身果实，对别人说：“我没去开会，在家赶着给儿子做件好衣裳。”
    在这热火朝天的参军浪潮中，大小会场、街头、饭场、家庭都吵着参军揭石板打蒋介石是大家的事，群众争先恐后的请新战士吃饭。在大会报名参军时，左有财向大会问清报名人数，跑步到合作社买了十六条手巾两包烟，赠给新战士。军属吴德胜捐出八百元给新战士。老军属和德明捐出七百元，今年翻身的穷军属和真的捐一千元，和雪则是个卖沙锅的穷老汉，也捐出七百元，新旧军属是一家不空，妇女将私蓄的“体己钱”捐劳二千元之多。妇女们并一面开会，一面忙着在会上给新战士缝包单。自动捐赠新战士的，在一百六十一户中即有一百四十六户，计洋六万八千零五十元，手巾十六条，鞋六双，袜四双，烟两包。群众的真诚热情给新战士很大的鼓舞。
    吴德胜军属在欢送会上说：“我受过艰难压迫，今天翻了身受到群众的优待和荣誉，感到非常的高兴。我今后更要努力生产，尽可能的减少群众对我的优待。”群众代表说：“军属孩子到前线去，咱们群众要把军属照顾好，使军属家不受困难，支援前线，这是我们大家的工作。”妇女们争先恐后给新战士戴花。
    欢送新战士走后，干部与妇女分别到新军属家进行安慰。吴德胜老汉没回家便到新军属左谜的家去安慰，遇见军属左三销老汉也到左谜的家后，吴德胜老汉说：“过去受饥饿，今天翻身受优待，有荣誉。咱们军属要搞好生产，少叫村上受麻烦，这是军属的光荣。”三个老汉聚在一起畅快谈心，甚兴奋。村干这夜会散后纺了卅斤麻绳，整理担架，准备结合前线揭大石板打蒋介石。（张治宏）
