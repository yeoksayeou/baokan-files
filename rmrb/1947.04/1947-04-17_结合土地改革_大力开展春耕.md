    Combine Land Reform and Vigorously Carry Out Spring Plowing

    Around the Grain Rain solar term, it's time to sow seeds and plant beans. The tense season of spring plowing and sowing has arrived. "If you don't sow seeds in spring plowing, you'll be angry to death in the fall." We should seize the opportunity, lead and organize a vigorous assault to successfully complete plowing and sowing, in order to lay the foundation for carrying out this year's great production movement. If we let it go unchecked, or don't pay enough attention to it ideologically, and thus delay the farming season, we will suffer no small losses.

    However, this year's spring plowing is being carried out in the context of continuing to implement land reform. Moreover, some areas still need to focus on implementing land reform. Therefore, we cannot abandon the thorough elimination of feudalism in spirit because of production; instead, we must combine production, pay attention to discovering and solving land problems, and be vigilant against the landlords' counterattacks at all times. That is to say, we must vigorously promote and create experience in combining spring plowing and land reform, so as not to delay spring plowing while implementing land distribution. Some places are already paying attention to doing this, planning to solve small problems at any time, delivering manure during the day and distributing land at night; large problems are solved during the spring plowing break, which is very good. We hope that all localities will grasp this point, follow the mass line, and create more methods and experiences. In some places, in order to ensure that participation in the war, production, and land distribution are not delayed, it is even more necessary to concentrate and give full play to the creativity of the masses, accurately calculate, and organize mutual assistance in order to overcome difficulties and do all three tasks well. However, at present, in many places, the land has not yet been plowed, the manure has not been delivered, and sufficient attention has not been paid to the combination of spring plowing and land distribution. This should be quickly overcome. Combining spring plowing and land reform, or combining war service, spring plowing and land reform, is a serious organizational task that must be implemented in our current practical work.

　　结合土地改革
    大力开展春耕
    谷雨前后撒花点豆，紧张的春耕下种季节已经到来。“春耕不下籽，秋后气个死”，我们应该抓紧时机，领导组织大力突击，胜利地完成翻地下种，以打下开展今年大生产运动的基础。如果任其自流，或在思想上注意不够，以致贻误农时，那就会受到不小的损失。
    但今年的春耕，是在继续贯彻土地改革的情况下进行的。而且若干地区尚须以贯彻土地改革为主。因之我们不能因生产而在精神上放弃彻底消灭封建；而必须结合生产，注意发现解决土地问题，随时警惕地主的反攻，也就是必须大力发扬与创造春耕与土地改革结合的经验，做到不误春耕，而又贯彻分田。现在有些地方，已经注意这样做，计划小的问题随时解决，白天送粪，晚上分田；大的问题等春耕空隙解决，这是很好的。希各地抓紧这一点，走群众路线，创造更多的办法与经验。有些地方，要使参战、生产、分田都不误，就更需集中与发挥群众的创造，精确计算，组织互助，才能克服因难把三种工作都做好。但目前尚有不少地方，地还未动手犁，粪也没送完，而对春耕、分田结合办法，也未引起足够注意，这是应该迅速加以克服的，春耕与土地改革结合或战勤、春耕与土地改革结合，都是一个严重的组织工作，必须贯彻在我们目前的实际工作中。
