　　Textile Hero Li Xiulian
    Promotes the Accelerated Wheel Spinning Machine
    Shen Shuwen's Whole Family Organizes Well
    Textile Dividends Excite Everyone
    [Our Newspaper, Licheng News] Taihang textile hero Li Xiulian, in order to lead Xia Village to quickly complete the "Hundred-Day Textile Plan," personally tried and promoted the accelerated wheel spinning machine. At first, she felt it was very difficult to use, but after a day or two, her hands became accustomed to it, and she spun the thread faster, spinning ten liang a day (previously only six liang with a small wheel). So she moved the machine to the women's folk school and experimented in front of the women of the whole village, spinning while saying: "The large spinning machine is good. Look how smoothly and quickly it spins! When you first learn, the thread should be drawn as quickly as possible, the wheel should turn slower, the large string should be slightly looser, and the small string should be slightly tighter. If we want to complete the Hundred-Day Textile Plan, it is best to spin with all new machines." On the spot, the women's confidence in using the new machine increased. Some said, "It's good, but no one makes the machines!" The Textile Committee immediately promised to help everyone find someone. Now four new accelerated wheel machines have been added, and more than ten have been modified. The whole village is now striving to modify all of them.
    [Another Dispatch] The experience of Xiaozhai Village, Licheng Sixth District, proves that family dividends in the textile movement are a decisive factor in harmonizing families, developing and consolidating women's textile enthusiasm, and successfully completing the "Hundred-Day Textile Plan," and an important step for women to gradually achieve economic independence. In the family of Comrade Shen Shuwen in this village, after mutual consultation, in addition to the twelve jin of cloth used by the whole family of six for joint textile production, the family provides the cotton, and the women do the spinning. Shen Shuwen's mother, in addition to being responsible for cooking, earns ten points for every two liang of cotton she spins. His daughter-in-law (who can weave) and his sister-in-law earn ten points for every six liang of cotton they spin and ten points for every zhang of cloth they weave. The family implements a "30/70 split" of the textile income (70% to the family). The three women then divide the 30% of the total profit according to their points. Since the implementation of this method, textile enthusiasm has been extremely high. (Yang Ke)

　　纺织英雄李秀莲
    推广加速轮纺车
    申书文全家组织好
    纺织分红人人带劲
    【本报黎城讯】太行纺织英雄李秀莲，为了带领霞庄村迅速完成“百日纺织计划”，亲自试用与推广加速轮纺车。开始觉着大不好用，但一两天后手顺了，线也纺的快了，每天能纺十两（前用小车仅纺六两），于是她搬上车子到妇女民校，对着全村妇女实验，一面纺一面说：“大纺车就是好，你们看多顺手，纺的多快哩！初学时线要尽量快抽，车轮要转的慢一点，大弦稍松些，小弦稍紧些，咱们要想完成百日纺织计划，最好全用成新车纺线”。当场妇女对使用新车信心提高，有的说：“好到好，可是没有人给作车啊！”立即由纺织委员会答应帮助大家找人，现已增加了四辆加速轮新车，并改造了十余辆，现全村正争取全部改造中。
    【又讯】黎城六区小寨村的经验证明：纺织运动中的家庭分红是和睦家庭，发扬与巩固妇女纺织情绪，胜利完成“百日纺织计划”决定性的因素，也是妇女逐步走向经济独立的重要步骤。该村申书文同志家庭，互相商量除去全家六口合伙纺织大伙用十二斤布外，由家庭供给花，妇女纺织，书文母亲除负责做饭外，每纺二两花顶十分，她媳妇（会织）与她嫂嫂每纺六两花顶十分，织一丈布顶十分，纺织收入家庭实行“三七分红”（家庭七），她们婆媳三个按分来分全部红利的百分之三十。自实行这种办法后，纺织情绪极高。（杨柯）
