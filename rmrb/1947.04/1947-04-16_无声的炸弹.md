　　Silent Bomb
    Jin Sha, Yang De
    Chiang Kai-shek's soldiers all have a silent bomb buried in their hearts—fear.
    On the night of the 5th, after the Battle of Houma was largely over, the Fifth Company of the 49th Regiment of the Chiang army, trapped in Nanbao, was still mired in painful fear and wavering. On the morning of the 6th, although they could see the People's Liberation Army and the common people cheering together in the Houma crossroads, and mounted soldiers coming and going in a hurry, they seemed to have lost consciousness. The American weapons in their hands seemed to have rusted, their hands and feet were weak, and they were trembling slightly.
    The People's Liberation Army decided to ignite this bomb and wrote the first letter of persuasion to surrender. A thirteen-year-old child volunteered to deliver the letter, but he was too small, and the gun hole was too high for him to reach. The child's mother volunteered to go in place of her son. When the old lady walked to the gun hole of the Nanbao bunker, the people above shouted, "We are going to throw grenades!" The old lady calmly said, "Throw them if you want!" She gave them the letter. After waiting for a long time without a reply, a second letter was sent. There was a response from the Nanbao city wall: several soldiers of the Fifth Company secretly poked their heads out from behind the city wall, curiously looking around. Company Commander Li Feng was forced to write a reply: "We can only surrender if our regimental commander and battalion commander give the order." Then a third letter was sent, but Li Feng continued to shirk responsibility: "Wait a moment, there are currently a few who disagree, and we are discussing it." However, the soldiers under his command were already walking back and forth on the city wall, some secretly looking this way, and some whispering to each other.
    By this time, it was dusk, and judging from the actions of the soldiers of the company, they were eager to surrender, but only Li Feng was still dragging his feet, waiting for reinforcements. The People's Liberation Army sent a final letter, setting a half-hour deadline for a reply, otherwise they would bombard the city with artillery. Soon the artillery opened fire, and the soldiers of the Fifth Company became agitated. Li Feng frantically replied with a hastily written letter, saying, "We have received your letter with respect. We are willing to lay down our weapons, but the opinion of all our officers and soldiers is that after surrendering our weapons, we can be allowed to return home as civilians and do not wish to be soldiers anymore. If possible, please send a letter to notify us, we eagerly await it." The silent bomb thus exploded. Machine gun squad leader Liu Ruixiang came down first, followed by the soldiers, carrying more than one hundred rifles and machine guns on the city wall. Their gun muzzles were not pointed at the people, but at Chiang Kai-shek's heart!

### 无声的炸弹

　　无声的炸弹
    金沙  养德
    蒋介石的士兵，心里都埋藏着一颗待炸的无声炸弹——恐惧心。
    五日黑夜，侯马战斗大体结束后，困守南堡的蒋军四十九团第五连，仍陷在痛苦的恐惧与动摇中。六日早晨，虽然他们可以见到侯马十字街头，人民解放军和老百性在一起欢呼，骑马的战士在匆匆来去，可是他们却好像失去了知觉，手里的美国武器也像生了锈，手脚瘫软，微微战栗。
    人民解放军决心点着这颗炸弹，写了第一封劝降书。一个十三岁的孩子自愿去当下书人，他个子小，枪眼高，攀不到。孩子的母亲自报奋勇代替儿子前去。老太太走到南堡碉堡枪眼前，上面的人大声喊着：“咱们要打手榴弹了”！老太太很沉着的说：“打就打吧”！她把信给了他们。等了很久，没有回信，又送去了第二封。南堡城墙上有了回答：第五连的几个士兵从城头后偷偷露出头来，好奇的探望着。连长李锋被迫写了回信：“要我们团长营长下命令才能缴枪”。接着又送去第三封，可是李锋仍然推诿着：“等一等，现在有少数不同意，正在讨论”。他部下的士兵却已经在城墙上走来走去，有的偷偷望着这边，有的交头接耳议论着。
    这时天已黄昏，看该连士兵的行动，是急着想缴枪，只有李锋仍在拖延，等待援兵。人民解放军下了最后一封书，限半小时答复，不然就用炮轰。不久大炮开火了，第五连的士兵骚动了，李锋慌乱的回了一封字迹潦草的信，上面说：“来信敬悉，我们放下武器是可以，不过我们全体官兵同志的意见，是要求缴了武器能放我们回家为民，不愿再为军人了。如果可以，请来函通知是盼。”无声的炸弹就这样爆炸了。机枪班长刘瑞香先下来，随后就是士兵，在城墙上挑着一百多支步枪和机枪。他们的枪口不是朝着人民，而是朝着蒋介石的心口！
