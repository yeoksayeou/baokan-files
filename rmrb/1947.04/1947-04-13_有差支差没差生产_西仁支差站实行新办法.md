　　Production: Those Assigned, Those Not Assigned - Both Get the Job Done.
    Xiren Labor Station Implements New Methods
    [Report from this newspaper in Heshun] The Xiren Labor Station in the First District, in order to save manpower and ensure that those assigned labor get assigned, and those not assigned labor can still produce, ensuring that no manpower is wasted, has discussed and come up with the following good methods for combining production and labor assignments: First, cadres at the station take the initiative to explain clearly to the villagers who are listening for labor assignments that stopping work for one day consumes one day's worth, but when there are no labor assignments, working one day not only covers meals but also earns money, and they are introduced to ways to make a living. Second, earn points by working, with one day divided into five shifts (one shift in the morning, two shifts in the morning, and two shifts in the afternoon), earning points per shift, and earning wages based on the points. Third, freely and temporarily form groups and contract for work according to different jobs, for example, how much the wage is for delivering a pile of manure. Fourth, if villagers listening for labor assignments work but the employer cannot afford to pay wages, they can return the work and offset it by a day of labor assignment. Fifth, families hiring laborers are responsible for meals and should prepare some dry food in advance to prevent the stretcher bearers from going hungry if they can't get a meal when a stretcher arrives. Sixth, the station will build a public blackboard to commend villagers who are good at production and use the benefits of production to educate the masses. The results of Bai Erhe and three others from Dafotou village were very good. In less than three days, they earned 3,400 yuan (and saved on food expenses). The rice, flour, and fodder they brought themselves were saved, and on the way back they carried charcoal from the Dayao kiln to Hanhu and sold it, earning another 2,600 yuan in one day. Zhang Fucheng, who hired laborers to do business, said, "Don't think they are the only ones benefiting; I also benefit. If I were to deliver the manure from my house, it would take at least twenty workdays. As a result, they delivered it in nine and a half workdays, which saved labor and allowed for early planting. It's beneficial to both families." (Heshun Office)

　　有差支差没差生产
    西仁支差站实行新办法
    【本报和顺讯】一区西仁支差站为了节约民力，做到有差支差，没差生产，做到不浪费一个民力。讨论出以下几项生产与支差结合的好办法：一、站上干部主动负责给听差的老乡解释明白，白停一天差消耗一天，但没有差务时，劳动一天管了饭又赚钱，给他们介绍营生。二、做活赚分票，一天分五晌（早晨一晌、上午二晌、下午二晌），按晌得分，按分赚工资。三、自由临时结成小组，按不同活实行包工，例如一堆粪送完是多少工资。四、听差老乡做活后，如因主家给不起工资，就还工，替他支下一天差。五、雇活的家管饭，事先要给准备点干粮，以防碰不到饭时，来了担架，不会饿肚抬走。六、站上建大众黑板，表扬生产好的老乡，以生产所得利益，教育群众。大佛头老乡白二和等四人干，结果很好，不到三天，赚洋三千四百元（还省了饭钱）。自己带的米、面、草料都省下了，另外往回走再到大窑驮上炭，到寒湖卖了，一天就又赚二千六百元。雇民夫做营生的张富成说：“不要看他们有利，我也有利，我家的粪要是我送的话，顶少也得二十个工，结果人家九个半工给送完了，又省工，又能早养种，还是两家都有利。”（和顺办公室）
