　　Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Our Troops Press the Attack
    Annihilate Over 1,000 of Liu Kan's Troops
    [Xinhua News Agency, Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Front, April 28th] Special correspondent Lin Lang reports: Following the annihilation of the 135th Brigade of Chiang Kai-shek's Hu Zongnan forces on the 14th, the Northwest People's Liberation Army annihilated over 1,000 men of Liu Kan's 29th Army of Chiang Kai-shek's Hu Zongnan forces on the 19th. The main force of Chiang Kai-shek's Hu Zongnan forces, eight brigades (later reinforced with another brigade, totaling nine brigades), failed in their attempt to meet the 135th Brigade and retreated south in panic. During the retreat, to confuse the People's Liberation Army, they feigned an attack on the southwest area of Wayaobao on the 17th. However, their trick was quickly seen through, and a powerful main force of the People's Liberation Army carried out a tenacious pursuit. The heavily damaged First Army retreated to the Yushuping and Shizui line, and Liu Kan's 29th Army retreated to the area north of Yongping. On the 19th, a unit of the People's Liberation Army pursued the retreating enemy, and after a day of fierce fighting, annihilated over 1,000 men of the 29th Army, captured over 100 alive, seized a large amount of weapons, and shot down and damaged one Chiang Kai-shek aircraft each. Since then, the enemy has been terrified and hurriedly clung together, avoiding contact with the main force of the People's Liberation Army. Thus, the nine brigades, with Panlong as their gathering point, have shrunk into a ball again and are now engaged in resupply. In this pursuit operation, the soldiers of Chiang Kai-shek's Hu Zongnan forces were tired of war and voluntarily laid down their weapons or fled at every opportunity. Their officers were afraid of fighting. Liu Kan and Dong Zhao did not dare to allow two or three brigades to operate alone, but gathered seven or eight brigades together before daring to move. The enemy, besieged in strongholds such as Qingjian and Wayaobao, with one regiment in each location, is isolated and helpless, relying only on air supply, and their situation is becoming increasingly precarious.

　　陕北我军乘胜追击
    歼刘戡部千余
    【新华社陕北前线二十八日电】本社特派记者林朗报导：继十四日歼灭蒋胡军一三五旅之后，西北人民解放军又于十九日消灭蒋胡军二十九军刘戡部千余人。蒋胡军主力八个旅（后又增加一个旅共九个旅）接应一三五旅之企图失败后，仓惶南退。撤退中，为迷惑解放军，十七日向瓦窑堡西南地区一度佯攻。惟奸计早被识破，强大之人民解放军主力一部实行坚韧尾击。其重创之第一军乃退至榆树坪、石咀一线，其刘戡之二十九军退至永坪以北地区。十九日解放军某部追击退却之敌，经竟日激战，歼二十九军千余人，生俘百余，缴获武器甚多，并击毁击伤蒋机各一架。自此敌人心惊胆怕，急忙紧紧靠拢，逃避与人民解放军主力接战，于是九个旅以蟠龙为集结点，又缩成一团，现正从事补给。此次追击作战中，蒋胡军士兵厌战，纷纷自动放下武器或乘隙逃亡。其军官则怕战，刘戡董钊竟不敢使两三个旅单独活动，而把七、八个旅靠拢一起才敢动作。困守清涧、瓦窑堡等据点之敌各一个团已孤立无援，仅依靠飞机接济，处境日趋危殆。
