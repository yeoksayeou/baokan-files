Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 18th. The results of the investigation into the case of American officers Rigg and Collins, captured on the front lines of Changchun, have been announced by the headquarters of the Democratic Allied Army. According to reports received by this reporter, their confessions during the various investigations revealed the profound political background of the US-Chiang collusion in waging civil war in the Northeast. A summary report is presented here to awaken the people of the nation to the vicious conspiracy of US-Chiang cooperation in attacking the Chinese people, and to raise serious vigilance.

Regarding the motives behind Rigg and others’ departure for the front lines of the Chinese civil war to conduct armed reconnaissance of the Northeast Democratic Allied Army's positions, Collins admitted in his initial interrogation that the purpose of the trip was to conduct "military observation." When asked, "Is it part of your military attaché duties to investigate combat situations during the Chinese civil war?" he replied, "That is our responsibility. We want to understand China's military strength." When asked, "Why observe the Chinese civil war, and what is the purpose?" he said, "I am a small person and do not understand. I only report what I see to Washington." However, after further questioning, "Why don't the British, French, and Soviet military attachés come to the Northeast, but only the United States is so interested? You already have consuls and military attachés from the embassy stationed in the Northeast, what does this mean?" he confessed, "We are here because we lack understanding of the real situation, especially in the Northeast." Rigg confessed that in order to "understand the situation in the Northeast," the United States not only sent consuls and military attachés to obtain information from the Kuomintang alone, but also established so-called "foreign investigation groups" for intelligence gathering. When asked about the situation of this organization, Rigg and others said, "This is an organization belonging to the State Department, with half of its personnel being civilians and half being military personnel." "Basically, their task is to conduct economic and geographical surveys, and their offices are located in Changchun and Shenyang. Some intelligence personnel have been sent to Kailu, Tongliao, and other Mongolian areas to operate." Collins said, "They are investigating maps, especially aviation maps..." The American imperialists' ambition for our Northeast and the traitor Chiang Kai-shek's willingness to sacrifice national interests and open the door to invaders can be further proven by the confessions of Collins and Rigg:

Question: "Why did you bring a pistol when you went to the front lines for observation?" Collins replied (hereinafter the same): "I always carry a pistol. I also carried it when I went to Beijing and Tianjin to pick up my wife." Question: "Do you have a gun license?" Answer: "No, no one has ever told me to." Question: "Do you think you should have a gun license?" Answer: "Yes, absolutely." Question: "What did you use the binoculars for on the front lines?" Answer: "To observe the troops." Question: "Observe the Communist troops?" Answer: "Of course, also observe them." Question: "What about the camera?" Answer: "The camera? To take pictures of typical soldiers." Question: "Does it include military matters and military buildings?" Answer: "It also includes them. There is no reason not to include them." Question: "Is your mission to photograph military fortresses?" Answer: "What do you mean by mission? Everything about the military must be known. That is our mission, our job." Question: "Did you get permission to take the camera to the front lines?" Answer: "No one has ever stopped us from bringing it." Question: "You can take pictures everywhere without hindrance?" Answer: "I can only say that I have not been interfered with." Question: "According to Article 2 of your diplomatic passport, you must notify the local authorities through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs before traveling inland. Why are you able to enter and exit the front lines at will during wartime without anyone's permission?" Answer: "I found that I could move freely, and I could pass through every time." Question: "You can walk around in the Kuomintang areas, they treat you with the courtesy of honored guests, and you can talk to any officer on the front lines. But it is not possible here. What is the reason for this? Please explain." Answer: "This is just my personal opinion. They are holding weapons given to them by the United States, so of course they feel good about Americans. Maybe they won't say it to your face, but they will say it behind your back."

Question: "How do you collect intelligence from the Kuomintang side?" Rigg replied (hereinafter the same): "When we need something and it seems important, we write a letter to ask for it. Of course, it mainly relies on personal observation." Question: "Do you often get information from the Kuomintang side about fighting with the Communist troops and 'enemy situation reports'?" Answer: "We have some. When we need it, we ask them for it." Question: "Is it possible, from common sense, for an American military attaché to go to the front lines without any documents, talk to the regimental commander, and give you military intelligence?" Answer: "Maybe you can say that this is a very bad judgment. I admit that."

From the above records, the close cooperation between the American imperialists and the Chinese traitor Chiang Kai-shek in the Northeast civil war is vividly portrayed. Therefore, Rigg finally had to reiterate his views on his capture on the front lines of the Chinese civil war, saying, "I am a victim of a conflict of two policies." He also said, "I fully understand your anger towards the American government because the United States has previously and until recently aided the Kuomintang with weapons. I admit that I have never had a pure position. I am in a very difficult position. I understand the significance of this case." At the same time, he put forward active and constructive opinions, saying, "I will definitely report everything to the embassy. I mean it in a friendly way. I better understand your attitude. Of course, I regret this trip (reporter's note: referring to reconnaissance of the Northeast Democratic Allied Army's positions). As a conclusion, I will suggest that the American government withdraw all American officers from China, except for military attachés. I want to specifically point out that the military advisory group should also be withdrawn."

    东北所俘二美军官供认不讳
    美蒋勾结进攻东北
    【新华社东北十八日电】美军官芮格及柯林士于长春前线被俘一案调查结果，已经民主联军总部公布。据记者获悉，彼等于历次调查之供词中，曾透露美蒋勾结在东北进行内战之深刻政治背景。兹特摘要报导，以唤起国人认识美蒋合作进攻中国人民之毒辣阴谋，而加以严重警惕。
    关于此次芮格等出发中国内战前线武装侦察东北民主联军阵地之动机，柯林士在首次调查中即承认此行系为进行“军事观察”。当询以“难道在中国内战时去考察作战情况也是你们武官任务之一？”彼答称：“这就是我们的责任，我们要了解中国的军事力量。”彼于答复“为何要观察中国内战、目的何在”时称：“我是一个小人物，不了解。我只把看到的东西报告给华盛顿。”但继经诘询“何以英、法、苏的武官都不到东北来，而只有美国如此感到兴趣？既有领事，还有大使馆武官们驻东北，这是什么意思？”彼供称：“我们到这里是因为我们缺乏对真实情况的了解，特别是东北。”芮格则供述美国为“了解东北情况”，不仅派有领事及武官从国民党单方取得情报，并设有所谓“国外调查团”的情报组织。询以这一组织之情形时，芮格等称：“这是属于国务院的一个组织，其中人员一半是文职，一半是武职。”“基本上他们的任务是进行经济和地理的调查，其机关设于长春及沈阳，一部情报人员曾派赴开鲁、通辽等蒙古地带活动。”而柯林士则称：“他们调查地图，特别是航空地图………。”美帝国主义对我东北之野心以及卖国贼蒋介石不惜断送国家民族利益开门揖盗的情形，从柯林士与芮格供词中，更可得到新的证明：
    问：“你为什么到前线观察要带手枪？”柯林士答（以下同）：“我总是带手枪的，到北平、天津接我太太时，也带着。”问：“有枪照吗？”答：“没有，从来没有人告诉过我。”问：“你认为应该有枪照吗？”答：“应该有，绝对应该有。”问：“带望远镜到前线干什么？”答：“用望远镜观察军队。”问：“观察中共部队吗？”答：“当然也观察的。”问：“照像机呢？”答：“照像机吗？给典型的士兵照像”。问：“是否包括军事事情和军事建筑在内？”答：“也包括，没有理由不包括这些。”问：“你们的任务就是要照军事堡垒吗？”答：“你说任务是什么意思？一切关于军事的都要知道，这就是我们的任务，我们的工作。”问：“带照像机到前线去是否得到允许？”答：“从来没有人不让我们带过。”问：“你可以到处照像不受阻碍吗？”答：“我只能说我没有受到过干涉。”问：“按照你的外交护照上第二条的规定，到内地旅行都要先由外交部通知当地长官，为什么你们却可以不须任何人证明在战时随意的出入前线呢？”答：“我发现可以自由行动，每次都可以通过。”问：“你们可以在国民党地区走来走去，他们以上宾之礼对待你们，可以到前线随便找一个军官谈话，而在我们这里就不行，这是什么缘故？请你解释。”答：“这只是私人的意见，他们拿着美国给他们的武器，当然对美国人觉得不坏。也许当面不讲，背后会讲。”
    问：“你如何从国民党方面收集情报？”芮格答（以下同）：“当我们需要什么并且似乎重要时，我们就写信去要，当然主要靠个人观察。”问：“你们经常从国民党方面得到关于和中共部队作战的情报和“敌情通报”吗？”答：“我们有一些。当我们需要时，我们就向他们要。”问：“一个美国武官到前线去没有任何文件可以找那个团长谈话，并且要把军事情报给你们，从常识判断有没有这种可能？”答：“也许可以说这是一个很坏的判断，我承认这一点。”
    从以上的笔录中，美帝国主义者与中国卖国贼蒋介石密切勾结在东北内战中之亲密合作，实已历历如绘。因而芮格最后对其在中国内战前线被俘之遭遇，亦不得不再申述其见解称：“我是两个政策冲突上的牺牲者。”并称：“我充分了解你们对于美国政府的愤怒，是由于美国以前直至最近还援助国民党的武器。我承认我从来没有纯正的立场，我是处在一种非常困难的地位，我了解这案件的意义。”同时彼更提出积极建议性之意见称：“我一定把一切报告大使馆，我的意思是友善的，我更好的了解你们的态度，当然我对于这次出来（记者按：指侦察东北民主联军阵地）是懊悔的。作为一个结论，我将建议美国政府将所有的美国军官，除了武官之外，通通从中国撤退。我要特别指出，军事顾问团，也要撤回。”
