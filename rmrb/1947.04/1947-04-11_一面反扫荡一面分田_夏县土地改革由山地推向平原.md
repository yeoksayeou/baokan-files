　　Distributing Land While Fighting Counter-Revolutionary Suppression
    Land Reform in Xia County Moves from Mountains to Plains
    [This newspaper's Taiyue dispatch, 9th] Over 130 villages in the mountainous areas of Xia County, including Nantiao, Beijin, and Lijiaping, have nearly completed land reform amidst the war and are now developing towards the plains. After the re-emergence of the mass movement in Xia County, in just over a month, over 130 villages like Nanjin were rapidly mobilized. Each peasant received an average of six mu of land, and each household added livestock. Extreme poverty in Nanjin village was completely eliminated. Most of the poor peasants in Xiaowang and Beijin villages have risen to the level of middle peasants. Last July, the Chiang Kai-shek troops invaded the area, and land reform was halted due to the war, but after our armed government arrived, the peasants' courage to struggle soared rapidly. In March, Chiang Kai-shek's troops concentrated over a thousand soldiers to suppress the mountainous areas, passing through areas like Songshuyao. It coincided with nearby villages holding a joint struggle meeting. Militiamen were on sentry duty on the mountain tops, and the masses brought dry rations, braving the wind and rain, moving several mountain tops a day, still persisting in the struggle. The masses of Nanjin village held a meeting on the mountain top to settle accounts, and were discovered by Chiang Kai-shek's troops, who fired dozens of shells; but the masses still did not disperse. Chai Shilu, the chairman of the farmers' association, said firmly, "No matter how madly Chiang Kai-shek's troops act, if you can't flatten this mountain, our meeting will not be dismissed." On the mountaintop, the peasants braved the cold wind to struggle against the landlords. Ma Deshun said proudly, "The landlords' usury has exploited us for thousands of years, what does the wind mean to us?" At the end of March, villages near Nanjin held a celebration meeting for over four thousand people who had turned over a new leaf. The masses all said: This is the first happy meeting since last July!

　　一面反扫荡一面分田
    夏县土地改革由山地推向平原
    【本报太岳九日电】夏县沿山地区南挑、北晋、李家坪等一百三十余村庄，在战争中已接近完成土地改革，现正向平原发展。夏县群运再起后，一个多月工夫，南晋等一百三十余村庄迅速发动。每个农民平均得六亩土地，每户皆添上了牲口。南晋村赤贫全部消灭。小王、北晋两村大部贫农已上升中农。去年七月蒋军侵入该地，土地改革曾因战争而停顿，但在我武装政权达到后，农民斗争勇气迅即高涨。三月蒋军集中千余，扫荡山地，路经松树窑一带，正值附近各村召开联合斗争大会，民兵在各山头放哨，群众个个带上干粮，冒着风雨，一天移数个山头，仍然坚持斗争。南晋村群众在山头开会清算，被蒋军发觉，发射炮弹数十发；但群众仍未分散。农会主席柴世禄很坚决的说：“不管你蒋军如何发狂，这座山如果你轰不平，我们这个会也散不了。”在山顶上，农民冒着寒风与地主斗争。马德顺昂然地说：“地主高利贷刮了我们几千年，风刮可算个啥。”三月底，南晋附近村庄举行了四千余人的翻身庆祝大会，群众都说：这是从去年七月以后第一次高兴的大会啊！
