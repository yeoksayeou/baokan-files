    Taihang Second Special District Decides
    to Suspend Miscellaneous Labor During Sowing Season
    [This newspaper's Taihang dispatch] The spring plowing and sowing season has arrived. In order to organize the people's strength and seize the time to fully carry out the great production movement, the Second Special District Office and the Military Sub-district Command and Political Department have decided to suspend labor levies for two months from April 21st (Grain Rain) to June 22nd (Summer Solstice). The measures are as follows: (1) Except for participation in combat, transporting ammunition, and carrying the wounded and sick, all labor levies will be suspended. 2. No matter what unit, local organ, or individual, it is strictly forbidden to use civilian labor casually. If anyone uses civilian labor indiscriminately, governments at all levels will refuse them. 3. Participation in combat, transportation of ammunition, and the carrying of the wounded and sick must be scientifically calculated and meticulously organized, and combined with production to ensure that civilian labor is not wasted. 4. All kinds of miscellaneous labor, floating labor, and disguised labor levies that waste civilian labor are strictly prohibited in all villages. 5. Border areas must strengthen vigilance and carry out a labor-military combination movement, earnestly save civilian labor, and abolish all floating and miscellaneous labor. 6. All theatrical performances will be suspended in all areas during this period. 7. During the spring plowing and sowing period, all organs and troops should mobilize all personnel and livestock to help the masses in the villages (especially the families of military cadres with no labor and demobilized veterans) with spring plowing and production, in order to strengthen the relationship between the military, government, and people and carry out this year's great production movement.
