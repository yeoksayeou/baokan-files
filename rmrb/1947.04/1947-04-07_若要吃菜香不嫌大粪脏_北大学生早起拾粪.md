    Peking University students get up early to collect manure
    [Report from this newspaper] All personnel of the various colleges of Northern University are enthusiastically launching a production campaign. In terms of agricultural production, the school headquarters has now made three hotbeds to cultivate vegetable seedlings for planting throughout the school. The College of Economics and Finance has organized sixteen production teams to prepare to grow vegetables, and an agricultural research team is specifically studying seed issues. Currently, comrades from various classes are busily weaving their own manure baskets and making wooden shovels. In the mornings and after dinner, students from the College of Economics and Finance carrying manure baskets can be seen on roads several miles around the residence. They have put forward the slogan: "If you want fragrant rice, don't mind the dirty manure." From late February to March 8th, the entire college collected a total of 5,230 catties of manure and produced more than 29,400 catties of fertilizer in sixteen days. The college's sideline production, with a capital of 300,000 yuan, earned a profit of 100,000 yuan in half a month. In addition to transportation, mills, flour mills, tofu workshops, and cigarette rolling, the entire school also has production activities integrated with learning. Under the personal leadership of Professor Guang Weiran, the Literary and Art Research Office established an art factory, which includes art printing, art dyeing, making stationery, plaster statues, badges, and engraving seals, etc. It has already printed 1,000 portraits of Chairman Mao, 500 sets of portraits of leading cadres in the Border Region, and 500 bottles of ink. The factory also has a musical instrument workshop attached, which is experimenting with the manufacture of sanhus and drums, etc. The College of Engineering is also preparing to produce glycerin in conjunction with learning. The College of Literature and Education raised 70,000 to 80,000 yuan in shares and bought three cigarette rolling machines, which have already started rolling cigarettes. The entire school already has dozens of spinning wheels spinning thread. The school headquarters used a 400,000 yuan fund for transportation. Since December of last year, it has earned a profit of 700,000 yuan in three months. (Kang Zhi, Chang Hua)
