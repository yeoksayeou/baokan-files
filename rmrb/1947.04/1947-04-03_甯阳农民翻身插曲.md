　　Interlude of Ningyang Peasants' Emancipation
　　For the past eight or nine years, the masses in Ningyang have been ravaged by enemy, puppet, stubborn, and bandit forces. In particular, the looting, burning, and killing by the Zhang "Beard" bandit gang and the exploitation by local despotic landlords in the past two years have brought even greater disasters to the people of Ningyang, leading to bankrupt peasants with no homes to return to in every village. However, after half a month of whirlwind-like land-to-the-tiller movement, one hundred and seventy-five villages in the first, third, fifth, and seventh districts have been completely transformed. The masses have removed the big stones weighing on their heads and reclaimed land from traitors, despotic landlords, and local bullies. Everyone has taken up foreign rifles and indigenous cannons for self-defense, implementing armed protection of their land and lives. The world in Ningyang has been renewed from this point forward.
  Unite in Defense to Protect Land and Lives
　　The masses in two villages in the third district said: "Whether Zhang 'Beard' comes to distribute land or not, if you don't beat him, he'll beat you. We are in a border area, and if we don't fight him, we can't protect the land." These two villages automatically united in defense to protect their land and lives. ×× Village conducted land reform while simultaneously standing guard and keeping watch. After the movement, the militia force was expanded to sixty-five people. The fifth district organized joint defense, with three villages forming a sub-district and twelve sub-districts forming a joint defense district. × Village alone organized eighty model squad members. The slogan is "Fight when the enemy comes, distribute land when the enemy doesn't come." Now they are very enthusiastic. In addition to standing guard and keeping watch at night, they do collective exercises every morning and afternoon.
  Wang the Mute Awakens
　　In × Village in the third district, there was a rich man named Su Xiankun who owned one hundred and forty *da mu* (one *da mu* equals three *xiao mu*) of land. He hired three long-term laborers and also sought short-term laborers every year. His entire family of seventeen people relied on exploitation for their meals. Su Xiankun exploited the villagers to the point where some starved to death and others fled. The family of the mute Da Yaba's father died of starvation. The mute's two brothers had worked for him for twenty-two years without getting a piece of land, and his eighty-year-old mother had to beg for food for more than thirty years. During the great famine in 1941, the whole village had nothing to eat. Su Xiankun buried forty to fifty thousand catties of grain, which later rotted, but fifty-two people starved to death in the village. This time, during the land reform, the masses vented their anger of many years and reclaimed their land. At first, Da Yaba was somewhat "resigned to fate" and did not report Su Xiankun's buried savings of the peasants' blood and sweat. Later, he was allocated one *mu* and four *fen* of land, one hundred catties of grain, two hundred catties of firewood, and a pair of cotton trousers. He became awakened and realized that it was time for the poor to rise up. He then led everyone to dig out two hundred and sixteen catties of copper coins and three thousand catties of wheat that he had buried for Su Xiankun. The mute gestured excitedly while digging out the grain. The mute's mother said: "With the Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army here, I won't starve to death anymore, and I won't have to beg for food again."

　　甯阳农民翻身插曲
    八九年来，宁阳的群众一直受着敌伪顽匪的蹂躏，尤以近两年张匪徒胡子的抢掠烧杀和恶霸地主的压榨，给宁阳人民带来更大的灾害，以致村村都有无家可归的破产农民。但经过半个月狂风暴雨般的土地还家运动，一、三、五、七四个区的一百七十五个村子完全变样了。群众把压在头上的大石头搬了，向汉奸恶霸地主要回了土地。大家扛起了自卫的洋枪土炮，实行武装保田、保命，宁阳的世界从此变新了。
  联起防来保田保命
    三区某两村群众说：“张胡子来了不管分地不分地，你不揍他，他要揍你。咱是边缘区，不给他拚，土地是保不了。”这两村自动联起防来，保田保命。××庄一面进行土地改革，一面站岗放哨。运动后又扩大民兵武装至六十五人。五区组织联防，三个村为一小区，十二小区为一联防区。只×村即组织起八十个模范班员。口号是“敌人来了打，敌人不来分田。”现在他们热情很高，除了晚上站岗放哨外，每天早晨上午集体操练。
  王哑巴觉悟了
    三区×村有个大财主名叫苏宪坤，有一百四十大亩（一大亩田三小亩）地，雇了三个长工，年年还觅短工。全家老少十七口都是靠剥削吃饭。苏宪坤把村里人剥削得饿死的饿死，逃的逃。大哑巴亲爷四个就是因为没吃的活活饿死。大哑巴兄弟俩给他扛了二十二年活，没弄上一块地，八十多岁的老娘还要了三十多年的饭。民国三十年大灾荒，全村人没吃的。苏宪坤把粮食埋起四五万斤，后来都烂了，但全村饿死了五十二口人。这次实行土地改革，群众发泄多年怒火，要回了土地。开始大哑巴还有些“认命”，不报告苏宪坤埋藏的农民血汗，后来他分了一亩四分地，一百斤谷子，二百斤柴火，一个棉裤，他觉悟了，认为该穷汉抬头了。他便领着大家挖出自己给苏宪坤埋的铜钱二百一十六斤，和三千斤麦子。哑巴比手划脚的掘粮食，高兴极了。哑巴的娘说：“共产党八路军来了，我就饿不死啦，再也不用要饭啦。”
