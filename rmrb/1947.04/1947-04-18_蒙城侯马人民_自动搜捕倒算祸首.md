The People of Mengcheng and Houma Counties
    Automatically Search for and Arrest Counter-Settlement Culprits
    [This newspaper's Taiyue Front dispatch, 14th] In the liberation of Mengcheng and Houma amidst the fires of war, the local masses spontaneously rose up to search for and arrest the "counter-settlement" culprits and "village administrators" who harmed the people's lives and property. On the night of the 4th, Qin Village and Qiaoyi Village captured "village administrator" village head Wang Yongtai, village platoon leader Wang Xuede, "counter-settlement" ringleaders Liu Peiche, Sun Ziyong, Sun Zimao and more than ten others. They also sincerely consoled the masses who had been persecuted. Qin Village's democratic village head, Yang Shuchang, and his eldest son were buried alive by Liu Peiche, his eight-year-old second son was frightened to death, and Yang's wife was driven mad by this. When consoling her, she suddenly became lucid and said: "When his father was buried alive, he cursed Liu Peiche, saying that he would cut off my Yang Shuchang's descendants, but he could not cut off the Communist Party; now it has come true, our troops have returned, the living have seen it, and the dead can rest in peace." During the capture movement, the combat troops automatically helped the masses. The communications platoon of the Third Company worked with the masses of Qin Village to search, and finally captured the "counter-settlement" ringleader Liu Peiche.

    自动搜捕倒算祸首
    【本报太岳前线十四日电】在光复蒙城、侯马炮火中，当地群众自动起来搜捕危害人民生命财产的“倒算”祸首与“治村”人员。秦村及桥驿村于四日一夜捕获“治村”村长王永太，村连长王学德，“倒算”头子刘培车及孙子永、孙子茂等十余名。并恳切慰问被残害的群众。秦村民主村长杨书常及其长子被刘培车活埋，八岁的次子被吓死，杨妻因此气疯，在慰问她时，她忽然清醒的说：“娃他爷被活埋时，大骂刘培车说，绝了我杨书常的后代，但绝不了共产党；现在应验了，咱们队伍回来了，活人看见了，死人也安心了。”捕捉运动中，作战部队自动帮助群众，三中队通讯班和秦村群众一同搜捕，终将“倒算”头子刘培车捕获。
