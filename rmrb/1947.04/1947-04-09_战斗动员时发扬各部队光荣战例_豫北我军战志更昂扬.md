　　Promoting Glorious Battle Examples During Combat Mobilization:
  　Our Army in Northern Henan Has Even Higher Fighting Spirit
    [Report from the Northern Henan Front of this newspaper] A new direction for combat mobilization of the main force in the Northern Henan Front is to fully promote the glorious traditions of each unit. Combining this with the current combat tasks, soldiers are encouraged to brainstorm and contribute ideas to create even more glorious achievements. For example, the "Xikang" unit proposed promoting the excellent traditions of the "Fanjiapo" field battle and the "Wangjiapo" and "Liujiapo" fortified attack operations. The "Wangjiapo" soldiers and the masses are even circulating a快板 (a form of Chinese spoken-word performance) praising the glorious combat history of their unit: "Rushing through Dongxi Wuquan, reorganizing the troops north of Maling, rectifying the atmosphere under Qulipu; accepting Japan's surrender in Hebei, recovering Baixiang city in one battle. Defending peace on Mount Luojia, annihilating the third battalion of Yan's army in Yangyi, the Yan'an headquarters sent a telegram to commend us, and we gained a great reputation for capturing Mashou. We fought well in Yigou Guzhuang, and made great achievements in the battle of Loulou. This time we act to fight, to defend our Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu." The soldiers use their personal experiences to educate and inspire the troops, highly enhancing their self-esteem and self-confidence, thereby improving combat morale. When the "Xizang" unit mobilized to fight tanks, the soldiers discussed, "We must promote the glorious tradition of the Zhifang battle and capture two live tanks." Under this mobilization slogan, all the soldiers of the Third Company were full of confidence and volunteered to fight tanks, dispelling some new soldiers' fear of tanks. This new direction of mobilization is more specific and more actively meaningful than simply pointing out the shortcomings of a certain unit and proposing slogans to overcome them in the past, and it is also easier and more enjoyable for soldiers to accept.
    [Report from the Northern Henan Front of this newspaper] In order to combine military training with actual combat, to know the enemy and ourselves and achieve greater victories, our "Hanmin" unit held a symposium for newly liberated comrades on March 15. Twenty-seven people participated. Based on their experience, it was determined that the Kuomintang army has "three most feared" things: (1) They are most afraid of our night battles, especially during marches. Because they fear our army, they are not allowed to eat when they arrive in a place, and they must first build fortifications. The soldiers carry more than 40 kilograms and walk all day, already hungry and exhausted, and then they have to build fortifications, everyone resents saying, "If we go home, we will still be caught, it's better to surrender when the Eighth Route Army comes!" When guarding at night, they are so sleepy that they nod off. (2) They are most afraid of our close combat. They are terrified when they hear grenades or see bayonets. (3) They are most afraid of our army's outflanking and encircling maneuvers in field battles. Once they find our army in their flanks and rear, they retreat in panic. During the Tangyin battle, when they saw a company of our people outflanking them, they all collapsed. (Liu Zhi)

　　战斗动员时发扬各部队光荣战例
  　豫北我军战志更昂扬
    【本报豫北前线讯】豫北前线主力部队战斗动员的新方向，是充分发扬各个部队的光荣传统，结合当前战斗任务，号召大家想办法出主意，努力创造更光荣的战功。如“西康”部队提出发扬“范家坡”野战及“王家坡”、“刘家坡”攻坚作战的优良传统。“王家坡”战士群众更流传着歌诵自己部队光荣战斗历史的快板：“东西武泉冲过锋，马陵北寒整过军，曲里堡下整过风；日本投降下河北，一仗收复柏乡城。罗家山上保卫和平，阳邑消灭阎军第三营，延安总部电报来表扬，攻占马首有大名。宜沟固庄打的好，鹿楼一战立大功，这次行动来打仗，保卫咱毛主席朱总司令”。战士们用亲身经历来教育与鼓舞部队，高度发挥了自尊心与自信心，因而提高了战斗士气。“西藏”部队动员打坦克时，战士们纷纷讨论“要发扬纸坊战斗光荣传统，俘虏两个活坦克”。在这一动员口号下，三连全体战士充满信心，都报名奋勇打坦克，解除了部分新战士对坦克的恐惧心理。这种新的动员方向较之过去仅针对某部队的缺点提出克服的口号，更为具体，更有积极的意义，且更为战士易于与乐于接受。
    【本报豫北前线讯】我“汉民”部队为使练兵与实战结合，知彼知己取得更大胜利，于三月十五日，召开新解放同志座谈会。参加者二十七人。根据其经验，研究出国民党军队有“三最怕”：（一）最怕我夜战，尤其在行军、因惧怕我军，每到一地，不许吃饭，先筑工事。战士们背四十多斤，走一天路，已饥疲交加，再修工事，人人怨恨说：“回家还是被抓出来，八路军来了缴枪算啦”！晚上放哨，困的磕睡。（二）最怕我近敌战，听到手榴弹，或看到刺刀，就胆战心惊。（三）最怕我军在野战中迂回包围，侧后发现我军，即仓皇撤退。汤阴战役中，见我有一连人进行迂回，全部就垮了。（刘志）
