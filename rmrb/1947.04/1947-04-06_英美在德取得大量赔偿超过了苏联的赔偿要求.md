Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 2nd. Zhukov wrote in Pravda: The Council of Foreign Ministers is now discussing the issue of reparations. Bevin wants to refute the undeniable facts cited by the Soviet newspapers, and he is partially supported by Marshall. The different situations revealed by the facts are well known. Anglo-American forces seized 270 tons of gold in West Germany, and the Soviet Union abandoned its claim to this gold. Under a special agreement with Switzerland, Anglo-American and other Western allies can obtain 50 tons of German gold from Swiss banks. In addition, the United Kingdom and the United States have also acquired German investments abroad, with only a small amount of investment in Eastern European countries remaining. It is estimated that this German foreign investment also amounts to 5 billion yuan. The United Kingdom and the United States have also obtained a portion of German merchant ships. The Secretary-General of the Allied Reparations Agency declared: The United Kingdom and the United States have obtained 102 merchant ships from Germany. The United Kingdom and the United States have also obtained a large number of the most valuable German patents and inventions, the total value of which is estimated to be nearly 5 billion yuan. The United Kingdom and the United States have transported a large amount of valuable equipment from Germany, and have also obtained reparations from current German industrial products (such as coal, timber, factory equipment, and consumer goods). The Anglo-American delegations deny these indisputable facts, saying that they are not paying reparations, but rather German exports, and the United Kingdom and the United States strongly claim that they fairly paid the price for the aforementioned exports. However, these explanations do not conform to the facts. News from the Ruhr area indicates that the coal exported by the United Kingdom in the area was exchanged for gold dollars, but the coal mine owners were paid in marks that were worthless in the world market. The same situation exists in the British and American occupation zones in other industries. This is the true nature of the "exports" referred to by the Anglo-American representatives. It is easy to understand that these "exports" are merely disguised reparations. In addition, countless facts can be cited to prove that the United Kingdom and the United States have obtained a large amount of reparations from industrial products, and a large amount of goods have been transferred to the hands of the occupying authorities. Newspapers in the Western occupation zones controlled by the United Kingdom and the United States have repeatedly reported that coal, timber, chemicals, lathes, engines, and textiles have been shipped from Germany to the United Kingdom and the United States. No one can argue that all countries have equally satisfied their reparation demands, while only the United Kingdom and the United States have fully satisfied their reparation demands. It is generally acknowledged that the 10 billion yuan in reparations already obtained by the United Kingdom and the United States during the occupation exceeds the Soviet reparation demands. Therefore, it is unreasonable to say that the Soviet Union is the only country interested in reparations.

　　英美在德取得大量赔偿超过了苏联的赔偿要求
    【新华社陕北二日电】朱可夫在真理报上写道：外长会议现在讨论赔偿问题，贝文想要反驳苏联报纸所引证的无可争辩的事实，他得到马歇尔的部分支持。事实显示的不同情形，众所周知，英美军队在德国西部缴获了二百七十吨黄金，苏联抛弃对这批黄金的要求。在与瑞士的特殊协定之下，英美等西方盟国可以自瑞士银行取得五十吨德国黄金。此外，英美两国又取得了德国在国外的投资，只有在东欧各国的小量投资在外，据估计此项德国对外投资亦达五十亿元。英美两国还获得一部分德国商船，盟国赔偿局秘书长宣称：英美已自德国获得一百零二艘商船。英美两国又从德国得到大量最有价值的专利与发明，全部价值据估计几近五十亿元。英美两国从德国运走大量有价值的装备，而且还从现时德国工业产品（如煤、木材、工厂装备和消费品）中取得赔偿。英美代表团否认这些无可争论的事实，说并非支付赔偿，而是德国的输出物，英美两国并强称他们公平的偿付了上述输出物的价格，然而这些解释都是不遵照事实的。来自鲁尔区的消息指出：英国在该地输出的煤换得了金元，但却以在世界市场上无价值的马克付给煤矿主人，旁的工业中英美占领区也有同样情形。这就是英美代表们所说的“输出”的真正性质，很容易明白，这些“输出”只是伪装了的赔偿而已。此外还可引证无数事实证明英美两国自工业产品中取得了大量赔偿，大量货物转入占领当局之手。英美控制的西部占领区报纸，一再报导煤、木材、化学品、车床、引擎和纺织品自德国输往英美。没有人能强辩说各国都同样的满足了它的赔偿要求，而独英美两国则十分地满足了赔偿要求。大家公认英美在占领期间已获得的一百亿元赔偿，超过了苏联的赔偿要求，因此说苏联是唯一对赔偿感觉兴趣的国家是毫无道理的。
