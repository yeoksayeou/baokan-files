　　Xinhua News Agency Reporter Comments on the Military Situation in Northeast China
  　Our Army Gradually Shifts to the Offensive
  　Eliminating More Enemies in Three Months Than in the Entire Previous Year
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northeast China, 3rd] Our agency reporter recently commented on the current military situation in Northeast China, stating: In the first three months of this year, the Northeast Democratic Allied Army, by eliminating more than four divisions of Chiang's troops, has opened a new chapter in the victorious patriotic self-defense war of the people and army in the Northeast Liberated Area. This situation means that the Democratic Allied Army has begun to gradually shift to the offensive, while Chiang's troops are moving towards the defensive. First, since the beginning of the year, the four fronts in the north, south, west, and east have simultaneously launched victorious counterattacks against Chiang's troops with agile postures. In North Manchuria, our army made three large-scale advances and retreats across the Songhua River, achieving major victories at Qitamu, Chengzi Street, and Kaoshantun. In South Manchuria, we continuously crushed Chiang's troops' three attempts to invade Linjiang, and then recovered the five county towns of Ji'an, Jinchuan, Liuhe, Huinan, and Huanren, placing two-thirds of Andong Province under the control of the people. As the wings of East and West Manchuria, and the rear of Chiang's troops in South Manchuria, have also achieved victories of various sizes in eliminating the enemy, coordinating with the operations in North and South Manchuria. Secondly, in these three months, our army eliminated a total of one complete division, eight complete regiments, and forty-nine complete battalions of Chiang's regular troops (excluding more than 8,000 troops below the battalion level and security regiments), accounting for more than a quarter of their total regular army, surpassing the achievements of the entire previous year (last year, a total of one complete division, three complete regiments, and ten complete battalions of Chiang's regular troops were eliminated). Among them, Du Yuming's two arms—the New 1st Army and the New 6th Army—suffered heavy losses. Each of the three divisions of the New 1st Army has lost one regiment. This is an important key to the change in the Northeast war situation. Thirdly, after several eliminations and attacks by our army, the morale of Chiang's troops has been dealt a major blow. For example, during the three advances across the Songhua River, the number of Chiang's officers and soldiers captured alive accounted for three-quarters of the total number eliminated. Finally, Chiang's troops are dispersed and insufficient in number, revealing a state of being stretched thin and in a difficult situation. When South Manchuria was in emergency, troops were drawn from the north to aid the south; when North Manchuria was in emergency, troops were drawn from the south to aid the north. However, Du Yuming's passivity did not begin today; this factor was planted as early as the Battle of Siping last summer. After he occupied Siping and went north, his troops were dispersed, and our army eliminated two of his regiments east of Jilin and near Huinan. At that time, the weakness of Chiang's troops was still temporarily concealed, but now it has been fully exposed. It should be pointed out that the state of passivity of Chiang's troops in Northeast China is still in its early stages. Although Du Yuming recently transferred five divisions from the 43rd Army and the 13th Army from Rehe, it will not help his current predicament. Despite reinforcing Northeast China, the land and sea gateways are still wide open. After Chiang Kai-shek has lost more than sixty divisions in the interior, there are almost no more troops that can be transferred. The victory of the Northeast military and civilians, in coordination with the victory of the People's Liberation Army in the interior, will inflict a serious blow on Chiang's troops in the coming months, and Du Yuming will not be able to escape a tragic fate.

　　新华社记者评东北军事形势
  　我军逐渐转入主动
  　三个月歼敌已超过去年全年
    【新华社东北三日电】本社记者顷评论目前东北军事形势称：今年头三个月，东北民主联军以歼灭蒋军四个多师的兵力，打开了东北解放区军民爱国自卫战争胜利的崭新局面。这种局面就是民主联军已开始逐渐转入主动，而蒋军则正走向被动。首先是自岁首以来北南西东四个战线同时以矫健姿态，主动展开了对蒋军的胜利反击。北满我军三次大踏步进出松花江南，获得其塔木、城子街、靠山屯三次大捷。南满则连续粉碎蒋军三犯临江后收复辑安、金川、柳河、辉南、桓仁五县城，使安东省三分之二地区掌握于人民手中。作为两翼的东西满以及南满蒋军后方，亦获得歼敌大小战果，配合了南北满作战。其次是三个月中，我军共歼正规蒋军一个整师、八个整团，四十九个整营（营以下及保安团八千余人在外），约占其全部正规军四分之一以上，超过去年全年战绩（去年全年共歼正规蒋军一个整师、三个整团及十个整营）。其中杜聿明两臂——新一军和新六军均受重创。新一军三个师已各折一个团。这是东北战局变化的重要关键。第三是经我军几次歼灭和攻击，予蒋军士气以最大打击。如三下松花江南时，生俘蒋军官兵即达其被歼全部的四分之三。最后就是蒋军兵力分散与不足，捉襟见肘、窘态毕露。南满告急抽北援南，北满告急抽南援北。然杜聿明的被动却不是自今日始，早在去夏四平之战，就种下这种因素。当其进占四平北上以后，兵力分散，我军即在吉林以东及辉南附近歼其两个团。当时蒋军弱点仍得以隐蔽一时，现在则暴露无遗。应当指出，东北蒋军处于被动尚在开始，杜聿明虽于不久前从热河调来四十三军及十三军共五个师，亦无补于其目前之危局。尽管增兵东北，但仍水陆门户洞开。在关内蒋介石已折损六十几个师之后，又几已无可抽调之兵。东北军民配合关内人民解放军的胜利，在今后数个月内将定予蒋军以严重痛击，杜聿明决无法逃脱悲惨的命运。
