　　Chairman Yang Rong Sends Another Letter to Egerton
  　Condemns UNRRA for Aiding Chiang Kai-shek's Crime of Damming the River and Silencing the People, Demands Swift Measures to Compensate for Losses to Our People
  　Jinnan First Administrative Office Calls For
    Prevention of Yellow River Water Entering the Wei River
    [Our Newspaper's Report] Border Government Chairman Yang and Vice Chairman Rong recently sent a letter to General Egerton, Director of the UNRRA China Office, condemning the office for assisting Chiang in violating the agreement to dam the river and release water, and demanding compensation for the losses of the people in the Liberated Areas; the following is a summary of the original letter:

    Mr. Tadd, and transmitted to
    General Egerton:

    A letter was sent on February 12th, presumably it did not arrive due to transportation obstruction.

    Recently, I learned from the Central News Agency broadcast that General Egerton had questioned Xue Dubi for violating the agreement to close the breach, which seemed to be a righteous act. But everyone knows that Chiang Kai-shek's ability to complete the damming and closing of the breach entirely depended on the full support of your office. Cooperation before, questioning after, is truly perplexing!

    Some say that your office was not aware of the final closure. This statement is self-defeating, considering that your office personnel were involved in the matter from beginning to end and made every effort to facilitate it.

    Some explain, "The Kuomintang reactionaries forcibly wanted to close the breach, which foreigners could not stop." But why did we not hear Mr. Egerton and others questioning this before the closure? Nor have we heard of any personnel from your office refusing to serve the illegal closure, and the fact is quite the opposite, so what do you say?

    Chiang Kai-shek's deliberate flooding of the Liberated Areas is his nature, which we are well aware of; but unexpectedly, UNRRA fell into the trap, assisting in the crime. Considering the purpose of UNRRA's arrival in China for relief, it is inconsistent, and even in terms of repeated participation in agreements guaranteeing implementation, it should be deeply regretted!

    Still others say, "Returning the Yellow River to its old course greatly benefits the people of the new flood area of Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu, and repairing the dikes is also sufficient to reduce the floods in Hebei, Shandong, and Henan. Taking advantage of the fact that the peach flood has not yet arrived, rushing to complete the closure is necessary for the project, and the benefits outweigh the harms." This statement seems to be well-founded, but it is absolutely difficult to justify. In a nutshell, closing the breach and releasing water before the dikes are completed will inevitably cause a devastating disaster, which is perfectly clear. The great trouble for the people in the Chiang-controlled areas is the oppressive rule of the Chiang family, which makes the people bankrupt and displaced, unable to make a living. The Yellow River is a small matter! Has the Chiang family ever had a moment or thought for the people's livelihood? Who caused the breach and change of course of the Yellow River in 1938? Now that he is eager to close the breach, is it for the sake of the disaster victims in the new flood area? In fact, he wants to cooperate with military offensives to divide and submerge the Liberated Areas in order to realize his delusion of eliminating the Communist Party and the people of the Liberated Areas. Chiang Kai-shek hates the Communist Party and the people who support peace and democracy a hundred times more than he hates the Japanese invaders. The urgency of closing the breach now is precisely for this reason. Judging from past events, the conspiracy is obvious. Why does your office fully assist in it?

    First repair the dikes, then close the breach, is the position of humanity; removing one harm and adding another is what the benevolent do not do, but because the harm is in the Liberated Areas, it is what Chiang is happy to do and eager to do. He makes every effort to achieve his evil plan. Delaying the payment of construction funds and relief funds to postpone the dike repair work is not enough, and he even uses the army to destroy and the planes to bomb, really fearing that the river will not break quickly! Otherwise, delaying the closure for a year and a half, leaving some time for the downstream to repair the dikes and slightly alleviate the flood disaster for the seven million people, and considering both the new flood area and the old river course, what is impossible, who says it is inappropriate? As for the various theories from the perspective of the closure project, regarding the lives and property of millions of people as weeds, it is even more of a euphemism for Chiang's crime!

    The past is gone, a big mistake has been made! General Egerton's questions to Xue Dubi may have been prompted by this feeling?

    The torrent is difficult to stop, the future is terrible. In addition to retaining the complete freedom to denounce Chiang Kai-shek's crime of creating the Yellow River disaster, if your office has the sincerity to remedy the past, then we have every reason to demand that UNRRA urgently try to reduce the immeasurable losses of the people in this area to the greatest extent possible. There is no other way than to meet Mr. Bi Wu, Director General of the UNRRA, and his completely reasonable demands, promptly allocate the labor, funds, and materials needed for dike repair, increase the resettlement relief funds, and allocate all of the two hundred million US dollars worth of materials stored by UNRRA for the relief of the Chinese people to the Liberated Areas.

    Now that Mr. Tadd has visited our area four times, witnessing the turbulent waves, the displaced disaster victims, the thin dikes, and the rampant Chiang army, and imagining the great disaster of the people in the coming days, will he also have feelings when he returns to the UNRRA and tells the gentlemen about it?
    Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 2nd (Delayed) The area of ​​more than 500 li in the lower reaches of the Yellow River in Kenli County, Bohai Sea, has been flooded. Fourteen villages including Bolaicun in the county have been submerged, and more than 10,000 residents of nineteen villages including Maosi @ are trapped in floods. They supported the old and the young, and screamed hysterically, fleeing to the highlands protruding from the water. At night, the cold wind chased the waves, and the cries were incessant. After the local democratic government urgently rescued them for four days with all its ships, most of the residents escaped, and only one-third of the food and clothing were rescued. The residents were separated from their wives and children, displaced and homeless, all stomping their feet and cursing the Chiang bandits, demanding revenge.
    Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 6th At 3 pm on the 1st, two American-style Chiang planes attacked Daoxu ferry in the old course of the Yellow River in the Bohai area, dropping several bombs and strafing wildly, killing and injuring several river workers and civilians, more than 20 livestock, and destroying 3 civilian houses.
    Our Newspaper, Jinnan, 6th The Jinnan First Administrative Office and the参议会, in order to prevent the harm of the Yellow River water entering the Wei River, issued a letter to 1.5 million compatriots in Northwestern Shandong, calling on them to rise up and save themselves, vigorously carry out river management work, widen and deepen the small rivers in various places such as the 咙莲江, the Majia River, the 金线 River and other rivers, and dredge the low-lying areas with accumulated water in various counties, and open ditches to release water to prevent the Yellow River disaster.

　　杨戎主席再函艾格顿
  　谴责联总助成蒋介石堵口罪行要求迅速设法补救我人民损失
  　冀南一专署号召
    预防黄水入卫
    【本报讯】边府杨、戎正副主席顷致函联总中国分署署长艾格顿将军，谴责该署助蒋违约堵口放水，并要求对解放区人民之损失有所补救；原函摘要如下：
    塔德先生并转
    艾格顿将军：
    二月十二日曾致书，谅因交通阻隔未达。
    日前由中央社广播获悉：艾格顿将军曾函质薛笃弼违约合龙，似属正义之举。但无人不知，蒋介石之得以完成堵口合龙工程，实唯贵署之全力支援是赖。合作于前，质问于后，殊令人不胜困惑！
    或谓，最后合龙贵署未之先知。是说也，由贵署人员之始终躬与其事，且多方为之设法观之，不攻自破。
    有解释者曰：“国民党反动派强欲合龙，非外国人所能阻之。”但何以未闻先生等质问之于合龙之前？亦未闻有贵署任何人员拒绝为违约合龙服务，且事实恰正相反，是又何说？
    蒋介石蓄意淹没解放区，乃其本性，吾人已熟知之；但未料联总竟入谷中，助成罪行，揆厥联总来华救济宗旨固有未符，即以累次参加协议保证实施言之，亦当深为遗憾！
    又或谓：“黄水归故大有利于豫皖苏新汛区之民生，复堤亦足以减少冀鲁豫之水患，趁桃汛未至，赶成合龙，为工程所必需，实利多而害少。”是说似乎持之有故，但绝难言之成理。一言以蔽之，堤未成而合龙放水必致造成滔天之灾祸，事理至明。蒋管区人民之大患，乃在蒋家虐政，使人民破产流离无以为生，黄河其小焉者耳！蒋氏家族何尝有一时一念为民生打算过，一九三八年黄河溃决改道，谁实致之？今彼急于堵口合龙，又岂为新汛区灾民计，实欲配合军事进攻，分割淹没解放区，以遂其消灭中共与解放区人民之妄想耳。蒋介石之痛恨中共与拥护和平民主之人民，百倍于对日寇，今之急于合龙正以此。证之往事，阴谋显然。奈何贵署以全力襄之助之？
    先复堤而后堵口，斯人道之立场；去一害而增一害，乃仁者所不为，惟其害在解放区，故为蒋氏所乐为所急为。百般设计，谋遂凶图。拖付工款救济费以推迟复堤工事犹以为不足，更以大军破坏、飞机轰炸，实惟恐河决之不速！否则迟一年半载合龙，为下游稍留复堤时间为七百万人民稍纾水祸，对新汛区与旧河道兼筹并顾，有何不可，谁云不宜，至从合龙工程观点出发之各种理论，视数百万人民生命财产如草芥，则更属蒋氏罪恶之讳辞！
    往者已矣，大错已成！艾格顿将军向薛笃弼提出质问，或亦有感于此而发欤？
    滔滔难止，来日可怖，我全区人民除保留声讨蒋介石制造黄灾罪恶之完全自由外，如其先生等具有补救已往之诚意，则吾人有一切理由要求联总急图减轻本区人民无量损失于万一。其道无他，即解总董主任必武先生所提完全合理之要求，速拨复堤修险所需之工粮、工款、与器材，增拨移民救济费，及以联总所存救济中国人民之二亿余美元物资，悉数分配于解放区。
    兹逢塔德先生四莅敝区，目睹浊浪奔腾，灾民失所，堤岸单薄，蒋军肆虐，遥想来日人民之大难，归述于联总诸先生，其亦将有感怀否？
    【新华社山东二日电】（迟到）黄河下游渤海垦利县方圆五百余里地区，已泛滥成灾。该县博莱村等十四个村庄已被淹没，毛丝＠等十九个村万余居民陷于洪水包围中。他们扶老携幼，声嘶力竭，逃于突出水面的高地上。入夜寒风逐浪，叫哭连天。经当地民主政府以全部船只急救四日，居民大部脱险，财物仅将粮食衣服抢出三分之一。居民妻离子散，颠沛流离，无不顿足痛骂蒋贼，要求复仇。
    【新华社山东六日电】一日下午三时，美式蒋机两架，袭击渤海区黄河故道道旭渡口，投弹数枚，并疯狂扫射，死伤河工民夫数人，牲口二十余头，炸毁民房三间。
    【本报冀南六日电】冀南一专署与参议会，为预防黄水入卫的危害，发出告鲁西北一百五十万同胞书，号召急起自救，大力进行治河工作，将各地小河如咙莲江、马颊河、金线河等河道增宽加深，疏通各县积水之洼地，开渠放水，以防黄灾。
