　　Southern Hebei Villages Accelerate the Clearing of Fruits of Victory
　　First Distributing Land, Oxen, and Farm Tools
　　Not Leaving an Inch of Land Uncultivated to Seize the Time for Spring Plowing
　　[Report from this newspaper] Many villages in Southern Hebei are accelerating the distribution of the fruits of victory, seizing the time for spring plowing. Currently, the farmers' most pressing demand is for quick distribution, first of land, oxen, and farm tools. In the Yuan Dynasty Fifth District, the principle of speed, thoroughness, and not delaying agricultural work was grasped during the clearing of the fruits of victory. Zhu Village, Wenji, and Qiantou Village all completed the clearing tasks within three days. The masses said: "This is done decisively and quickly. If it were not done this way, the land would be wasted. Only dividing the floating wealth will not prevent starvation." Now the farmers are all happily producing on their newly distributed land. After the victory of the struggle in Liuli Temple, Nangong, the masses immediately proposed "First distribute land for good spring plowing." Under this spirit, the village has already distributed all the land. In Xiaoluzhai, Julu Third District, according to the demands of the masses, farm tools were distributed first as production capital. The masses said triumphantly: "Dividing the land is only worrying about planting, dividing the tools means there is no worry!" In the process of clearing the fruits of victory in Wucheng Fifth District, poor peasants reflected one after another: "We are always talking about dividing the fruits of victory, but we never see it being divided. What are we waiting to eat? There is no firewood at home to cook, and we can't do work in the fields, so we can't plant the land, and we can't afford to delay." The unanimous opinion of the poor peasants is "Divide whatever there is, divide it for good spring plowing, and then clear it up during the slack time of spring plowing." The district leadership has already conducted research and decided that the principle of clearing the fruits of victory is not to hinder the production of the masses, and to strive for speed. In addition, some villages did not measure the land after it was divided, and the masses were not at ease in their production. Some could not recognize the boundaries of the land and could not start spring plowing. After seeing these situations in Beisizhuang, Yaoshan, they immediately organized to measure and plant mulberry trees. As soon as they did this, the farmers who had been eager to plant were overjoyed. Zhao Xiaocheng hurried to the land he had been allocated and waited, vying to measure his land first. He said: "I have wanted to clean up the land for a long time, but I didn't dare to do it. I can do work after it's measured. I haven't had land for half my life. Let me plant my own land as soon as possible!" Under the spirit of not delaying agricultural work, Tianlou in Gaotang First District, with swift action, distributed all seven qing and fifty mu of the fruits of victory land to the farmers in thirteen days. On average, each member of the masses leveled three mu, and all one hundred and two poor peasant households rose to the level of middle peasants. There are now still one hundred and fifty mu of land left, which are planned to be distributed immediately to the poor small villages of Duzhuang, Xulou, Daxiaosunzhuang, Lilou, Qiuzhuang, and Anzhuang. Currently, the masses in the village are enthusiastically discussing spring plowing production and are also continuing the struggle against the three landlords who have not been thoroughly struggled against and the five rich peasants who have not been weakened.
　　[Report from this newspaper, Southern Hebei] After the land was divided in Beifengzheng, Jize, the whole village still had more than sixty mu of good land left, plus the 41.7 mu of land returned by organs and organizations. The Farmers' Association had a total of more than one qing of land saved, which was not divided. The furthest of these lands from the village is more than eighteen li away, and the nearest is twelve li away, making cultivation extremely inconvenient, and the village's labor force and livestock are also quite lacking. Each labor force needs to cultivate an average of more than thirty-one mu of land, and the newly emancipated farmers all feel that they cannot cultivate it. Currently, spring plowing has arrived. In order to prevent these lands from being barren, the Farmers' Association has specially decided to temporarily distribute them to the mutual aid teams for cultivation. The method of distribution is: first distribute these lands to the mutual aid teams with relatively little land for their members, and absolutely do not allow even one mu to be barren. (Xi Min)

　　冀南不少村庄加速清理果实
    先分土地耕牛农具     
    不荒寸土抓紧春耕
    【本报讯】冀南不少村庄加速分配果实，抓紧时间进行春耕，目前农民最迫切的要求就是快分，先分土地、耕牛、农具。元朝五区在清理果实中，掌握了迅速、彻底不误农时的原则。朱家村、文集、前头村都是在三天内完成了清理任务，群众说：“这样办干脆快当，如不这样办地就荒了，光分浮财脱不了挨饿。”现农民都到自己刚分得的新地上愉快的生产。南宫琉璃庙斗争胜利后，群众马上提出“先分土地好春耕”，在这个精神下该村已将土地分完。巨鹿三区小吕寨，根据群众要求，先分农具作生产资本，群众得意的说：“分了地光愁种，分了用具就不愁了。”武城五区在清理果实中，贫农纷纷反映：“光说分果实老不见分，俺吃什么等着呢？家里没柴烧不能作饭，地里活不能做就种不上地了，耽搁工夫也耽搁不起。”贫农一致的意见是“有什么分什么，分了好春耕，春耕的空子里再清理。”该区领导上已作了研究，决定清理果实以不妨碍群众生产为原则，并力求迅速。另有些村庄分地后没丈量，群众生产不踏实，有的认不清地块地边，无法插手春耕。尧山北寺庄，看到这些情形后，马上组织起来丈量栽桑树，这样一作，喜坏了早想快种地的农民。赵小成急忙跑到分的地头上等着，争着先量自己的地，他说：“我早就想收拾地，就是不敢动手，量完我的我好作活，我半辈子没地，叫我早种上自己的地吧！”高唐一区田楼在不误农时的精神下，以迅速的动作，十三天即把果实地七顷五十亩全部分到农民手里，一般群众每人均填平三亩，一百零二户贫农全部上升为中农。现还余地一百五十亩，准备立即分给杜庄、徐楼、大小孙庄、李楼、邱庄、安庄七个贫苦小村群众。目前该村群众正热烈讨论春耕生产，并结合对三家未斗彻底的地主和未得到削弱的五家富农继续斗争。
    【本报冀南讯】鸡泽北风正土地分完以后，全村尚剩好地六十余亩，加上机关、团体退地四一．七亩，农会共保存土地一顷多没分。这些地离村子最远的在十八里以外，最近的也有十二里，耕种异常不便，而本村劳力及牲口又相当缺乏，每个劳力平均需种地三十一亩以上，新翻身农民都觉得种不过来。目前春耕已到，为了不使这些地荒芜，农会特决定暂时先分给各互助组耕种。分法是：尽先把这些地分到组员土地比较少的互助组里，绝不能让它荒掉一亩。（西民）
