　　Under "Pursuit"
　　Zǐ Jūn
　　Since Hu Zongnan's troops entered Yan'an, they have been wandering like a group of lost souls, marching from Yan'an to Anzhai, and then from Anzhai back to Yan'an; after a few days, they started again from Yan'an, going to Anzhai, Yanchang, Yanchuan, and Qingjian, wandering back and forth. It is said that this is called "pursuit." But they have never been seen to "pursue" anything to the end. It was not until the People's Daily published a diary on the tenth of this month, written by Duan Hansan, a third-class pharmacist in the "pursuit" team, that the inside story was revealed to the world.
　　"Under the shining bayonets of the pursuit, everywhere is the mournful cry of pigs and the chaotic flight of chickens. What is our performance to the people? It is countless chickens dying under a hail of bullets, countless pigs sacrificed under a flurry of knives!" (March 15)
　　"...In this way, each of our units has had plenty of meat and other things to eat during this time; my mouth is tired of eating." (March 16)
　　We see that after a period of "the mournful cry of pigs and the chaotic flight of chickens," only a day later, even the mouth of a third-class pharmacist was tired of eating. It is said that the person who wrote this diary was a young man of only twenty-five years old, so after he really exclaimed, "My mouth is tired of eating," he could still say, "I can't bear it, I hate it." A bit of humanity that has not been completely submerged allows him to reveal these true scenes to us.
　　However, this is nothing new. Not to mention in the Liberated Areas, in the other world controlled by Chiang Kai-shek, Hu Zongnan, and others, not to mention the distant past, just on the fifth and eighth of last month in Chongqing, a group of young men and women students performing street dramas to protest the atrocities of the American military, after a period of "bricks, stones, tables, chairs, and sticks flying everywhere" and "large teams charging with carrying poles and wooden sticks," "the woolen sweaters and blue cloth clothes of the female students were stripped or torn, and pens and coats were robbed." (Xinhua News Agency, 26th) Wasn't that also how they were "pursued"? Just the next day (9th), at the meeting held by the staff of the Shanghai Department Store to promote boycotting American goods and using domestic goods, under a barrage of shouting, wooden sticks, and stones, wasn't that also how they were "pursued"? Liang Renda of Wing On Company was beaten to death in such a "pursuit" scene.
　　However, although under the same "pursuit," the results are very different. On the same day that Duan Hansan's diary was published in the People's Daily, on one hand, there was "the mournful cry of pigs and the chaotic flight of chickens," and on the other hand, on the hills of northern Shaanxi, there appeared Gao Yanxi's rapid-firing rifle and the hand grenade held high by Yin Yufen. Coincidentally, on March 25, Li Jiyun, the brigade commander captured under the hand grenade held high by Yin Yufen, happened to be the "superior" of the same 31st Brigade as Duan Hansan. It can be seen that the scenes they personally experienced were the same; on one side, "pigs were crying mournfully, chickens were flying chaotically," and on the other side, Gao Yanxi's rapid-firing rifle was sounding from this hill to that hill. No wonder when he was captured under the hand grenade held high by Yin Yufen, he said: "My mind is in chaos, I don't know what to say."

### “追击”之下

　　“追击”之下
    子君
    自从胡宗南的军队进入了延安，好像一群游魂一样，从延安游行到安寨，又从安寨游行到延安；过了几天，又从延安开始，又到安寨、延长、延川、清涧，游来游去。据说这就叫做“追击”。但却始终未见他们“追”出个究竟来。一直到本月十日人民日报发表了一个“追击”队上的三等司药段汉三的日记，此中底细，才算大白于天下。
    “刺刀闪亮的追击下，到处是猪的悲鸣，鸡的乱飞。我们对人民的表现是什么呢？是无数鸡在乱枪下送命，是无数的猪在乱刀之下牺牲！”（三月十五日）
    “……这样我们这些时候每一单位，都有很多的肉及其他的东西吃，我的嘴吃腻了。”（三月十六日）
    我们看，在一阵“猪的悲鸣，鸡的乱飞”之后，仅仅相隔一天，就连一个三等司药的嘴都吃腻了。据说写这段日记的，还是一个不过二十五岁的青年，因此当他真正的叫着“我的嘴吃腻了”以后，还能说出“我不忍，我痛恨”的话来。一点还没有完全被淹没的人性，使他为我们透露了这些真切的情景。
    然而这也不是什么新奇的了。在解放区不用说，在蒋介石、胡宗南等所掌管的另一个世界里面，远的也不去说它，就在上一个月五日和八日的重庆，在街头演戏宣传，抗议美军暴行的一群青年男女学生，在一阵“砖石桌椅棍棒乱飞”，“扁担、木棒的大队冲击”之后，“女学生的毛线衣蓝布衣服被剥去或撕毁，钢笔大衣被抢去。”（新华社二十六日电）不也是这样被“追击”过的么？刚好接着第二天（九日），在上海百货公司职员所开的宣传抵制美货、服用国货的会议上，在一阵叫嚷、木棒、石块之下，不也是这样被“追击”过的么？永安公司的梁仁达，就是在这样的“追击”场中被活活打死了的。
    不过虽说在同样的“追击”之下，结果却是很不相同的了。在发表段汉三日记的同一天的人民日报上，一方面是“猪的悲鸣，鸡的乱飞”，另一方面，在陕北的山头上，却出现了高颜喜的水连珠步枪，尹玉芬手上高举的手榴弹。说来也很凑巧，三月二十五日那一天，在尹玉芬高举的手榴弹下被捉住的李纪云旅长，恰恰就是和段汉三同一部分三十一旅的“上司”。可见他们所亲历的情景，都是相同的了；一边“猪在悲鸣，鸡在乱飞”，一边高颜喜的水连珠步枪这个山头那个山头的响，怪不得当他在尹玉芬手中高举的手榴弹下被捉住以后说：“我心绪已乱，不知该说什么了。”
