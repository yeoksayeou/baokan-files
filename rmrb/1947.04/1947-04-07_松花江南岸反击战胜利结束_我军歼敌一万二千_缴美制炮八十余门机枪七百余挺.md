Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 4th: According to incomplete statistics from the Northeast Democratic Allied Army Headquarters, in the two major annihilation campaigns at Chengzijie and Kaoshantun south of the Songhua River, our forces killed or wounded over 3,500 Chiang Kai-shek soldiers and captured over 9,000 Chiang Kai-shek soldiers, including Zeng Qi, regimental commander of the 89th Regiment of the New 1st Army's 30th Division, Lan Songyan, regimental commander of the 3rd Regiment of the 88th Division, Lei Naidian, regimental commander of the 264th Regiment, and officers and soldiers below the rank of deputy regimental commander. The above included the 71st Army Headquarters direct units, the entire 88th Division, part of the 87th Division, the entire 89th Regiment of the New 1st Army's 30th Division, part of the New 6th Army's 22nd Division, and the entire 10th Security Regiment. The spoils of war included over 80 various U.S.-made cannons, over 760 light and heavy submachine guns, over 90 60mm mortars, over 50 rifles, 5 captured and destroyed tanks, over 60 vehicles, 650 war horses, over 300 carts, over 50 telegraph and telephone machines, and countless ammunition and supplies.

Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 4th: The battle south of the Songhua River, which lasted 24 days from February 20th to March 16th and resulted in the victories of the two major annihilation campaigns at Chengzijie and Kaoshantun, has now concluded victoriously. This marks the second self-defense counterattack launched by our Northeast Democratic Allied Army north of Changchun, after making a large-scale crossing of the Songhua River. On the morning of February 23rd, the Democratic Allied Army captured Sima Jia, Dajia Gou, and Dajia Gou Station north of Dehui in one fell swoop, annihilating a county security battalion of Chiang's army. That evening, they continued to capture Chengzijie (north of Jiutai), annihilating the entire 89th Regiment of the New 1st Army's 30th Division, one battalion of the 90th Regiment, and the division's directly subordinate mountain artillery battalion. Our army then advanced along the Changha, Jichang, and Changtao lines, capturing important towns such as Nong'an, Jiutai, Huajiaqiao (south of Nong'an), H湾zi, Huapichang (east of Jiutai), and Kalajie (west of Jiutai) on the 25th. On the 26th, we captured Tumenling (east of Jiutai), and simultaneously, in Buhai (south of Dehui) and Renjia Youfang, annihilated the entire 10th Security Regiment and one battalion of the 9th Security Regiment, and occupied the Buhai Mishazi Station, cutting off the Changha and Changtao lines. At this point, in order to continue to maneuver and strike the enemy, our army actively moved backward. At this time, Chiang Kai-shek, on the one hand, ordered the Central News Agency to boast of a "large-scale battle brewing around Changchun," and on the other hand, ordered Du Yuming to concentrate five divisions, a total of twelve regiments, including the 38th and 50th Divisions of the New 1st Army, the 22nd Division of the New 6th Army, and the 87th Division of the 71st Army, to advance north in separate routes, putting on an absurd farce in the style of Ah Q. Just at this moment, the Democratic Allied Army again marched south in large strides, and on March 7th, completely routed the entire 184th Regiment of the 50th Division of Chiang's army in the Dajia Gou and Chaoyangbao areas north of Dehui. In the evening, the 88th Division of the 71st Army at Kaoshantun northwest of Dehui was also routed. On the 10th, as the division retreated to Dehui, one battalion of its 262nd Regiment was completely annihilated by our forces, and five companies of its 264th Regiment were intercepted by our forces at Kaoshantun and were also annihilated by our forces on the evening of the 10th. At this time, the enemy urgently transferred the main force of the 88th Division and the entire 87th Division to reinforce Kaoshantun. After a day and night of fierce fighting, the entire 88th Division was annihilated. The 71st Army's directly subordinate engineering battalion, two transport battalions, one communications company, and a field hospital were all annihilated. In addition to his disappointment, Du Yuming hastily gathered the 54th Division of the 13th Army newly transferred from Rehe, the 22nd Division of the New 6th Army, and three divisions (six regiments) of the New 1st Army, and advanced north along the Changtao line via Nong'an. On the 15th and 16th, our army continued to annihilate two companies of the 66th Regiment of the 22nd Division in the Nong'an area, successfully completing this campaign.

　　松花江南岸反击战胜利结束
  　我军歼敌一万二千
  　缴美制炮八十余门机枪七百余挺
    【新华社东北四日电】据东北民主联军总司令部不完全统计，此次松花江南岸城子街、靠山屯两大歼灭战役中，共毙伤蒋军官兵三千五百余人，生俘蒋军新一军三十师八十九团团长曾琪、八十八师三团团长蓝嵩岩、二六四团团长雷乃电及副团长以下官兵九千余人。以上包括七十一军军部直属队、八十八师全部、八十七师一部、新一军新三十师八十九团全部、新六军新二十二师一部及保安第十团全部。缴获各种美制炮八十余门，轻重冲锋机枪七百六十余挺，六○小炮九十余门，步枪五十余枝，缴获并击毁坦克五辆，汽车六十余辆，战马六百五十余匹，大车三百余辆，电报及电话机五十余部，弹药物资无算。
    【新华社东北四日电】自二月二十日至三月十六日持续二十四天，取得城子街，靠山屯两次大歼灭战胜利之松花江南岸战役，业已胜利结束。此为我东北民主联军大踏步越过松花江、在长春以北地区展开之第二次自卫反击。二月二十三日晨，民主联军一举攻占德惠北四马架、达家沟及达家沟车站，消灭蒋军一个县保安大队；当晚续攻占城子街（九台北），消灭新一军三十师八十九团全部，九十团一个营及师直属山炮营。我军旋即向长哈、吉长、长洮沿线进击，二十五日攻克农安、九台、桦家桥（农安南）、河湾子、桦皮厂（九台东）、卡拉街（九台西）等重要城镇，二十六日攻占土门岭（九台东）、同时在布海（德惠南）与仁家油坊，消灭保安第十团全部及保安九团一个营，并占领布海米沙子车站，将长哈、长洮等线截断。至此，我军为继续机动打击敌人，乃主动向后移动。此时蒋介石一面令其中央社吹嘘“长春外围酝酿大会战”，一面令杜聿明集中新一军三十八师、五十师、新六军二十二师、七十一军八十七师等五个师，共十二个团的兵力，分路北援，大演其阿Ｑ式的双簧丑剧。恰在此时，民主联军又大踏步南下，三月七日将德惠以北之达家沟、朝阳堡一带蒋军五十师一八四团全部击溃。入晚，又将德惠西北靠山屯之七十一军八十八师击溃。十日该师向德惠溃退途中，其二六二团一个营为我全部歼灭，其二六四团五个连被我截阻于靠山屯，十日晚亦为我歼灭。此时，敌急调八十八师主力与八十七师全部向靠山屯增援，经一昼夜激战，八十八师全部被歼。七十一军直属队之一工兵营、两个辎重营、通讯营一个连及野战医院等，全部被歼。杜聿明于扫兴之余，急忙集结新从热河调来之十三军五十四师，新六军二十二师及新一军三个师（六个团），沿长洮线经农安北进，十五、十六两日，我军以续歼农安地区之二十二师六十六团两个连，胜利完成此一战役。
