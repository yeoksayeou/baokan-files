　　Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 9th—According to a recent urgent telegram received by the "Wan Qing" relief ship in Yantai from the "Wan Sheng," the "Wan Sheng" was transporting UNRRA relief supplies from Shanghai to Shijiusuo (in Rizhao County) in the Shandong Liberated Area, when, unexpectedly, at 9:00 AM on the 2nd of this month, while navigating near Shijiusuo, it was again wantonly bombed by American-made Chiang Kai-shek aircraft. The ship sustained heavy damage, the captain's leg was blown off, and both the fireman and helmsman were seriously injured. This is the fourth time that the Chiang faction has sent aircraft to frenziedly bomb UNRRA relief ships, obstructing relief to disaster victims in the Shandong Liberated Area. It is reported that after Chiang's aircraft bombed the "Wan Jing" relief ship in Shijiusuo on February 6th, they bombed the "Wan Shan" at the same location.

　　蒋机又狂炸联总救济船
    【新华社山东九日电】据最近来烟台之万庆号救济船接万圣号快电称：该舰近由上海运送联总救济物资至山东解放区石臼所（日照境），不意于本月二日九时行至石臼所附近海面，竟又遭美式蒋机肆意轰炸，该舰遂负重伤，舰长腿被炸断，火班及舵手均受重伤。蒋党此种派机狂炸联总救济船只，阻止联总山东解放区灾民之罪行，此为第四次。按二月六日蒋机曾轰炸至石臼所救济船万敬号后，复于该地轰炸万善号。
