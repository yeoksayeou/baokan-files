Leading the Whole Village to Prosperity
    --Remembering Stone Cun Jin, First-Class Labor Hero of Taihang
    Ji Yu

    Stone Cun Jin is the top labor hero in the Taihang region. In the old society, he worked as a hired hand for thirty years. Since the Eighth Route Army came and he was liberated, he returned home to farm his own land. He accepted scientific knowledge, was good at promoting past good experiences, criticizing past bad ones, and became the best creator in leading the masses of LiCheng county to improve production technology. He is also a good educator with the most prestige and practical application in production.

    I. Understanding Everyone's Thoughts and Implementing Education on Getting Rich
    Last spring, when rectifying mutual aid groups, the rich peasant Fan Juren said, "Everything you get will belong to others in the future." Stone Cun Jin understood his fear of struggle, so he used himself as an example to get through Fan's thinking, saying, "What we are struggling against is exploiting others, not what we earn through our own labor. Wu Manyou has even more than us. I now have four cows, and no one can take even one away. If I work like this, the government rewards me, not for me personally to get promoted and become rich, but to promote everyone in the village to become rich like me." Middle peasant Huo Jinyu also dared not rise up for fear of being cut down, saying, "Things are almost settled now, no need to make any more trouble." Old Stone seized the opportunity to educate him, saying, "In the old society, our village didn't even average one mu of land per person; under Chairman Mao's call, our village opened up six hundred mu of wasteland, and now each person averages two and a half mu. In the past, what you earned in a year would be swept away by others at once. Now, no matter how much you earn, it's your own." He also said, "The more we work, the more energetic we become. In the past, it was remarkable to have three mu of land as a hired hand; now we still feel it's not enough and want to get more land." Old Stone mobilized people to work hard, saying, "We still have to prevent disasters every year. If you don't work hard for a year, it's not enough to eat a short meal, you need to eat a long meal. Don't be complacent, we must achieve 'cultivate three, save one' this year." The masses said, "Achieving 'cultivate three, save one' is not a problem, we can do it even if we sit down." Old Stone said, " 'Cultivate three, save one' is not a limit, it would be even better to 'cultivate one, save three,' the purpose is to have more and more. We must achieve 'cultivate two, save one' this year, and we must combine agriculture and sideline occupations." The masses asked him what he meant by combining agriculture and sideline occupations. He said, "It won't work to only engage in agriculture, we must organize the remaining labor force and the lonely and widowed to develop spinning, weaving, and transportation." Later, he personally took the lead in setting a plan of "cultivate two, save one," promoting the whole village to set a plan of "cultivate three, save one."

    II. Creating a Labor-Capital Cooperation Transportation Cooperative
    Last spring, the village organized fifteen animal power and eleven labor power for transportation. Problems arose during the busy farming season. Those working in the fields pointed out: Our village has livestock households doing transportation every day, asking us to farm the land for them. If they don't farm the land, they can make money, we are at a great disadvantage. Old Stone then led everyone to hold a meeting to discuss and establish a labor-capital mutual aid cooperative, mobilizing households without livestock to invest shares. The masses agreed very much, and a total of 25,000 yuan was invested. They also worked out a dividend distribution method of "labor nine, capital one." More than 30 households in the whole village participated in the labor-capital cooperation cooperative. Old Stone was elected as the chairman, and the cooperative led all the mutual aid groups in the village. Those who wanted to engage in transportation could engage in transportation. Jia Sanyuan liked to deal in mules and horses and did not sow seeds during the sowing season. Old Stone said to him, "You quickly sow the seeds. Later, our cooperative will pay for the shares, and you will contribute the labor shares to buy livestock." This immediately hit his thinking. He plowed four mu of land in one day, quickly completed the sowing, and went to buy livestock for the cooperative. Old Stone also mobilized the masses: Whoever wants to buy livestock, the cooperative will advance the money. When you earn enough livestock money, the livestock will be your own. He also organized the exchange of bad livestock for good livestock. Through his efforts, the whole village increased its livestock by eleven heads, exchanged four heads of good livestock, and earned 500,000 yuan, buying 30 mu of land. Now the cooperative has become the organizer and leader of agricultural and sideline occupations in the whole village.

    III. Using Experience and Science Combined to Improve the Agricultural Technology of the Masses
    1. Overcoming the Masses' Thought of Despising Technology. During spring plowing and sowing, he explained to the masses: Autumn plowing should be deep, spring plowing should be shallow, because the spring wind is poisonous, how deep you plow, how deep it will dry, deep plowing does not nourish and is not drought-resistant. In fertilizing and improving the soil, when he was trained at the Agricultural and Forestry Bureau, he studied with experienced old farmers from various places and found that mule and horse manure is good for back slopes, and pig manure is best for sunny slopes. He educated the masses that in addition to applying more manure, they should also pay attention to what manure is suitable for what land. The masses' thinking was not very clear, saying, "Isn't all manure manure?" Old Stone said, "Cow manure is weak manure, sheep and donkey manure is hot manure, pig manure is yin manure, we must be clever in making fertilizer and clever in applying fertilizer. In the past, I also applied it haphazardly, whatever manure I had, I applied. Only after being trained at the Agricultural and Forestry Bureau did I understand this principle." But the masses still didn't quite believe it, so he used practical experience to educate the masses. Last year, he planted two plots of cotton, one with ash fertilizer which grew very well; one with pig manure which did not grow well. Educating the masses in this way, the masses believed it. Old Stone also gained an experience: without benefit, the masses will not listen to you. He seized this point to make the masses believe in the importance of technology. For example, in the past, this village grew cotton without pruning or fertilizing, so the cotton did not grow well. The masses said, "Our place is naturally not suitable for growing cotton, it can only grow crops." After Old Stone returned from training at the Agricultural and Forestry Bureau, he experimented himself on the one hand, and studied with the Technical Committee on the other hand, and personally went to the fields to teach the masses. When pruning cotton, he called the village chief's wife to the field to help him prune; later, the flowers bloomed very well. The village chief's wife said, "Old Labor helped me prune, that's why it grows so well, it all depends on making good crops, we must plant more next year." The masses also believed it and said, "Let's do whatever Old Labor tells us to do!" Some of the masses' cotton seedlings were not enough, and they were very anxious, some said they wanted to plow it. Old Stone used the scientific method he learned during training, plus his experience in transplanting radish seedlings from the previous year, and studied with the Technical Committee to come up with a seedling transplanting method: bring the soil of the cotton seedlings themselves, transplant yin seedlings to yin land, yang seedlings to yang land, and the small seedlings lived. In this way, twenty-eight mu were transplanted.

    2. Using the comparison of how much grain was produced to educate the masses: When promoting early planting, the masses said that they had lost money on early planting last year, so they would not plant early this year. Old Stone said, "If we don't plant when the soil is so moist this year, when there is no rain later, it will be troublesome to carry water to plant millet and we won't be able to produce more grain." As a result, those who planted early harvested early, and the grain yield was also higher, and the masses were very happy. When hoeing small seedlings, he led everyone to use small hoes, saying, "This year, we planted early, and small hoes can surround the roots. In the past, we used sickle hoes and couldn't surround the roots, and it would fall over as soon as the wind blew." He personally led the young people to hoe, using the ridging hoe method to sandwich two bad hands in the middle, overcoming the past method of "old cows turning their heads and no one paying attention to anyone." When auxiliary labor was hoeing seedlings, he organized old men to combine with women and children, educating and overcoming the habit of women gossiping together. He calculated work points according to technology when hoeing, adding points for good work, which increased the enthusiasm of the old men; he also educated about seed selection in the field. Some of the masses said, "In the past, we wouldn't plant the land without selecting seeds?" As a result, the selected seeds grew well and were disease-free. This year the masses said, "Let's listen to Old Labor! Everyone is selecting seeds in the field."

    3. Changing the Old Habits of the Masses: In autumn, the masses were accustomed to harrowing the land. Last year, Old Stone proposed not harrowing. The masses said that if they didn't harrow, they couldn't mix in pig manure, and there was a shortage of livestock in the spring. If they harrowed early, they could spread some pig manure the second year to save harrowing and be able to plant. Seeing that the masses did not pay attention to technology but only paid attention to planting, Old Stone explained based on his experience the previous year that not harrowing would produce more grain. If you harrowed and wanted to save labor, it was actually not labor-saving. Before you could plant the millet, the grass and the millet would come up together. Not harrowing could freeze the insects and the roots of the thistle grass, and could retain moisture after the snow fell, and the wind couldn't blow it away. From then on, the masses slowly began to pay attention to technology. At the same time, they also felt that not paying attention to technology in the past was also forced. Poor people had no land to plant, and they were exploited by others. The landlords always complained that their work was too slow; even if they had two mu of land at home, they would do it blindly and hurry out to find work.

    IV. Ideological Education in Promoting Superior Crops
    At the beginning of planting Golden Queen corn, the masses thought it was not tasty, not easy to push, and too expensive to fertilize. Old Stone mobilized everyone to discuss and compare it with local corn. Later, the masses were willing to plant it, but there were no seeds, so he helped solve the problem, and the whole village planted 400 mu. When the masses were husking corn, they said, "Local corn takes five ears to husk one sheng, while Golden Queen takes two ears to husk one sheng, as long as the crops are well made, it's not just about fertilizing." The masses all said that they had planted too little this year.

    When planting 169 wheat, the masses had suffered losses the previous year, saying that 169 was "all gone." Old Stone and the Technical Committee studied the characteristics of 169: wind-resistant and drought-resistant, suitable for the local climate, because there were droughts in nine out of ten years here. They also studied that 169 had a lot of straw, and if planted too densely, it would not be ventilated, and there would be jaundice if there was too much rain. Last year, everyone listened to him and planted sparsely, and there were no problems. Of the 500 mu of wheat land in the whole village, 480 mu were planted with 169.

    Under the leadership of Stone Cun Jin, the entire village of Huo Jia Yao achieved "cultivate one, save one" last year, and his family achieved "cultivate one, save two," with an average yield of three dou of grain per mu more than the previous year, and Golden Queen yielded eight dou more than local corn.

　　领导全村生产致富
    ——记太行一等劳动英雄石寸金
    冀雨
    石寸金是太行区头名劳动英雄。旧社会时住了三十年长工，自从八路军来翻了身，便回家种自己地，他接受了科学知识，善于发扬过去好的经验，批判过去不好的，而成为领导黎城全县群众改进生产技术最好的创造者，又是生产行的最有威信和实际结合的好教育者。
    一、了解大家心思贯彻发家教育
    去春整顿互助组时，富农范巨仁说：“受下将来都是人家的”。石寸金了解了他这种怕斗争思想，便拿他自己作例去打通范的思想，说：“咱们斗争的是剥削别人的，自己劳动来的不斗争，吴满有比咱还有哩。我现在有四头牛，别人谁也不能拉走一头，像我这样劳动，政府奖励我，并不是为我个人升官发财，就是为了推动全村大家都像我这样发财。”中农霍金鱼也不敢上升怕割韭菜，说：“现在闹的差不多了，不用再往上闹了。”老石便抓紧教育他说：“旧社会时咱村一个人还平均不上一亩地；在毛主席号召下，咱村开了六百亩荒地，现在每人平均二亩半。过去受一年一下叫人家刮走了，现在闹下多少也是自己的。”他又说：“愈闹愈有劲，过去咱住长工，有三亩地就了不起；现在还嫌少，还想再闹些地。”老石动员耕三余一说：“咱们还得年年防灾，动弹一年下来，短吃不行，长吃才行，还不要自满，今年要达到耕三余一。”群众说：“耕三余一不成问题，坐着也能作到。”老石说：“耕三余一并不是限制住，耕一余三更好，为的是有了再有；咱们今年要作到耕二余一，就得农副业结合起来。”群众问他什么叫农副业结合？他说：“光搞农业不行，把剩余劳力孤寡都组织起来开展纺织、运输。”以后他个人首先订了耕二余一的计划，推动全村订了耕三余一计划。
    二、创造劳资合作运输社
    去春村里组织了十五个畜力十一个劳力运输。农忙时问题便出来了，在地里作活有人提出：咱村有牲口户每天运输，叫咱给种地，人家不种地能赚钱，咱太吃亏。老石便领导大家开会研究，成立劳资互助社，动员没牲口户入股，群众很同意，共入了两万五千元，又研究出分红办法是劳九资一，全村三十余户都参加了劳资合作社，老石被选为社长，互助社领导全村互助组，愿搞运输就搞运输。贾三元好贩骡马，下种时也不下种，老石就给他说：“你快下了种，以后咱合作社出钱股，你出人股，去买牲口。”这一下打准了他的思想，他一天耕了四亩地，很快完成了下种，给合作社去买牲口。老石又动员群众：谁想买牲口，合作社给垫上，啥时赚够牲口钱，啥时牲口是你自己的。又组织坏牲口倒换好牲口。经过他的努力，全村增加牲口十一头，换好牲口四头，又赚洋五十万，买地三十亩。现互助社成了全村农副业的组织者与领导者。
    三、用经验与科学结合提高群众农业技术
    １、克服群众轻视技术思想。春耕下种时，他给群众解释：秋＠地宜深，春翻地宜浅，因春风毒，耕多深就干多深，耕深不养晌不耐旱。在施肥与改良土壤中，他在农林局受训时，便与各地有经验的老农研究出背坡地上骡马粪好，阳坡地上＠粪最好。教育群众除多上粪外，还要注意什么地上什么粪，群众思想不很通，说：“啥粪不是粪。”老石说：“牛粪是虚粪，羊驴粪是热粪，＠粪是阴粪，我们要巧作造还得巧上粪。我过去也是糊涂上，有啥粪上啥，自农林局受训后才知道这个道理。”但群众还不大相信，于是他就用实际经验教育群众。他去年种了两块棉花，一块上了灰粪长的很好；一块上的＠粪长的不好，这样教育群众，群众才相信了。老石也得了个经验：没利，群众就不听你的话，他抓住这点使群众相信了技术的重要。如这村过去种棉花，不打杈也不上粪，所以棉花长不好。群众说：“咱这地方天生就不能种花，只能长庄稼。”老石在农林局受训回来，一面自己实验，一面和技术委员会研究，并亲自去地教群众。棉花打杈时，便叫上村长老婆去地给他打杈；后来花开的很好，村长老婆说：“老劳动帮我打了杈才长这样好，全凭作造，明年可要多种些。”群众也相信了说：“老劳动叫咱做啥咱就做啥吧！”有的群众棉花不够苗，很着急，有的说要耕了，老石就用他受训时学的科学办法，加上他前年移萝卜苗的经验，和技委会研究出移苗办法：带上棉苗本身土，阴苗移到阴地，阳苗移到阳地，小苗就活了，这样移了二十八亩。
    ２、用打粮多少对比教育群众：提倡早种时，群众说去年早种没收，今年可不早种了。老石说：“今年这样大的晌不种，等后来没雨了，担水栽谷又麻烦又不能多打粮。”结果早种上的早收了，粮也打的多，群众很高兴。锄小苗时，他领导大家用小锄说：“今年种的早，用小锄能围着根，过去用韭镰锄了围不住根，一刮风就倒了。”他亲带上青年人去锄，用打垅锄办法当中夹两个坏把式，克服了过去老牛打回头谁也不理谁的办法。在辅助劳力锄苗时，组织老汉结合妇女儿童，一面教育且克服了妇女们一块好拉闲话的习惯。锄时按技术计工，好的加分，提高了老汉的积极性；又教育田间选种，有些群众说：“过去咱不选就不种地了？”结果选了种的长的又好又没病。今年群众说：“听老劳动的话吧！都在地里选种”。
    ３、改变了群众旧习惯：秋天群众习惯要耢地，去年老石提出不耢，群众说不耢不能拌＠，春天牲口缺，早耢了第二年泼上些＠省得耙耢就能种。老石看见群众不注意技术只注意种，便根据前年经验，说明不耢多打粮，耢了想省工，实际并不省工，你还没种上谷，草和谷就一齐上来了。不耢可冻死虫子和刺角草根，下了雪还能留晌，风刮不走。从此群众慢慢都注意起技术来。同时也感到过去不注意技术也是被迫的，穷人没地种，给人家受，人家剥削劳动老嫌作的慢；家里有二亩地，也是瞎作出来赶快出去找活儿。
    四、推广优良作物中的思想教育
    开始种金皇后玉茭，群众认为一不好吃，二不好推，也太费肥，老石便动员大家讨论与土玉茭比较，后来群众愿种了，又没种籽，他又帮助解决，全村种了四百亩。群众到撇玉茭时说：“土玉茭五穗才剥一升，金皇后两穗就剥一升，只要作造好，不光凭上肥。”群众都说今年种的少了。
    种一六九小麦时，群众前年吃了亏，说一六九是“一溜光”，老石便和技委会研究一六九的特点是抗风抗旱，适合本地风土，因这里十年九旱。又研究出一六九麦秆多，种的稠了不透风，雨水一多就生黄疸。去年大家都听了他的话，种得稀都没问题，全村五百亩麦地，种一六九就有四百八十亩。
    在石寸金领导下，去年霍家窑全村作到耕一余一，他家作到耕一余二，每亩比前年平均多打三斗粮，金皇后比土玉茭多打八斗。
