Xinhua News Agency, West Manchuria, 7th: Five Chiang Kai-shek Mongolian soldiers, including Te Zhabu (Quan Mingshan) and Hul Shao Tu (Wu Guoxi), who laid down their weapons in the Kaoshantun battle in northern Manchuria, told reporters about their experience of being deceived: "We are all ordinary people from Shebotu area of the East Middle Banner. In August last year, when the Kuomintang 88th Division and 64th Regiment were stationed in that area, more than 800 Mongolian youths were captured and sent to the 88th Division headquarters in Bamiancheng. After a month of training, they were ordered to go to the front line to fight against the Democratic Allied Army. When we were captured this time, we all thought it was over, because the superiors had said, 'You must never be captured. The Democratic Allied Army will cut off the ears of Mongolians first and then bury them alive.' But when we were sent to Qiqihar, we saw many Mongolian slogans in the building we were staying in. We felt very strange and didn't dare to ask, fearing that people would recognize us as Mongolians. One night, a few of us were walking near the dormitory when a young man asked us where we were from. We inadvertently said we were from the East Middle Banner, but it happened that the other person was also Mongolian. He told us about the situation in Wangyemiao, and we were both excited and surprised. Didn't the superiors say that Wangyemiao was where Ma Gushan's troops were? We knew we were being deceived again. I remember when we were stationed in Wohutun, a Chiang Kai-shek special agent deliberately tested us to see if we wanted to desert. He secretly told two other Mongolian brothers that he had been captured and wanted to go home. He asked if we, who were locals, could think of a way. Those two Mongolian brothers believed him and readily agreed, saying, 'Let's go together.' Who knew that they were arrested and executed the next night. After this incident, the Mongolians were very angry. The bolder ones deserted with their guns. We knew that more than seventy people had run away. We are Mongolians, but we are not allowed to speak Mongolian. If we do, they say we are 'organizing a rebellion.' When guarding the post, the Guanli soldiers stood guard from one o'clock, and we stood guard from one thirty. The Guanli soldiers were issued cotton clothes and shirts, but we were only issued one set of cotton clothes. But when it came to fighting, they crawled on the ground, not daring to raise their heads, and threw their guns at us, saying that Mongolians were good at shooting. At that time, we thought, what are we fighting for like this? What value is there in sacrificing ourselves? When the Democratic Allied Army launched an offensive, we voluntarily surrendered our weapons."

　　被解放的蒙古士兵
    痛述受骗内战经过
    【新华社西满七日电】于北满靠山屯战役放下武器的蒋蒙古士兵特扎布（全明山）、胡勒少吐（吴国西）等五人，对记者谈被骗经过称：“我们都是东科中旗舍伯吐一带的老百姓，去年八月间，国民党八十八师、六十四团在那一带驻防时，被抓走蒙古青年八百多人，送到八面城八十八师师部，整训一个月后，就叫往前线跟民主联军打仗。当这次我们被俘时，都以为算是完蛋了，因为上级曾讲过，你们千万不要做俘虏，民主联军对蒙古人就先割耳朵后活埋。但当我们被送到齐齐哈尔来后，在住的楼上，看见许多蒙古文的标语，感到很奇怪，也不敢问，怕人家看出自己是蒙古人来。有一天晚上，我们几个在宿舍附近散步，有一位年青人问我们是什么地方的人，我们不觉的说出是东科中旗的人，但是恰巧对方也是蒙古人，他告诉了我们王爷庙的情形，又是兴奋又是奇怪，过去上级不是说王爷庙是马古山部队在吗？我们知道又是受骗了。记得在卧虎屯驻防时，有个蒋记特务特意试探我们要不要开小差，秘密向另外两个蒙古弟兄说，他是被抓来的，想回家，你们是附近人，能不能给想个办法？那两个蒙古弟兄，信以为真，满口答应说：要走一同走。谁知第二天晚上就被抓去枪毙了。这件事发生后，蒙古人都很气愤，胆大的就拖枪逃跑，我们知道的就跑了七十多个。我们是蒙古人，但不许说蒙古话，讲了就说是要“组织叛变”。站岗时，关里兵站一点钟，我们站一点半，关里兵发棉衣又发衬衣，我们就只发一套棉衣，但到打仗时，他们爬在地上不敢抬头把枪丢给我们，说蒙古人枪法好，当时我们想，这样打下去为了什么？牺牲了有何价值？当民主联军一冲锋时，我们就自动的缴了枪。”
