Wei County Ganji Town Deepens the Investigation and Confiscation of Feudalism
    "Backward" Masses Persuade Each Other
    Voluntarily Reporting Hidden Property
    [Our Newspaper] Wei County's Ganji Town launched a "two-pronged" attack on landlords, on one hand, breaking through the "backward" masses, and on the other, cutting off the feudal vestiges of the landlords. During the mass movement, the landlords' conspiracies and tricks were varied, desperately dispersing land and concealing materials. For example, Zhang Laoen, who had been cleared four times, used methods such as fake pawnings, fake sales, fake divisions, and relatives acting as nominees to disperse hundreds of acres of land. He also used the "backward" masses' sense of sentiment, clan relations, and bribery and deception to hide farm tools, woodenware, furniture, cotton, and grain in the homes of five families, including Zhang Bogen. Or, taking advantage of the poor peasants' weddings and funerals, he pretended to help but actually concealed property. After the masses discovered these cunning schemes of the landlords, the Turn-Over Committee carried out a full mobilization, calling for voluntary reporting and the implementation of an 80-20 reward system. At the same time, small groups universally discussed: "Pat your heart (who did you rely on to turn over?), ask your heart (calculate the landlords' kindness and grievances from the older generations?), compare your heart (who is progressive and who is backward?)." The discussion formed a persuasion movement for the "backward" masses, which set off a wave of voluntary reporting. In two days, fifteen families reported more than forty items, such as cabinets, boxes, and farm tools, hidden for the landlords. At the same time, the "backward" masses' thinking began to progress. For example, Ma Shiwei said: "I lived in the landlord's house and wanted to rely on the landlord, so I hid the large square table for Zhang Jingting." Then he said: "Relying on the landlord for a lifetime is a poor wretch; relying on the Communist Party, you have food and clothing." However, there were still those who were waiting and watching. The Turn-Over Committee continues to deploy forces, deepen mobilization, promote voluntary and secret reporting, and shout the slogan "Sieve the landlords again and again" to carry out repeated inspection movements.

　　威县干集镇深入查封建
    “落后”群众互相规劝
    纷纷自报隐蔽财物
    【本报讯】威县干集镇展开对地主“双管齐下”的追击战，一面突破“落后”群众，一面割地主的封建尾巴。群运中地主阴谋诡计，花样百出，拚命疏散土地和隐蔽物资，如经过四次清算的张老恩，用假当、假卖、假分、亲友顶名等办法，疏散土地百亩；又利用“落后”群众情面心理、宗族关系及收买欺骗，在张伯根等五家藏着农具、木器、家具、棉、粮等；或利用贫农的红白喜事，假帮助而实隐蔽。群众在发现地主这种狡猾阴谋后，翻委会即进行全体动员，号召自报和实行二八提奖。同时小组普遍讨论：拍拍心（翻身靠的谁？）问问心（从老辈上算算地主的恩与怨？）比比心（谁进步谁落后？）讨论中形成对“落后”群众的规劝运动，遂掀起自报热潮，两天中有十五家报出给地主藏的柜、箱、农具等四十余件。同时“落后”群众思想开始进步，如马士为说：“俺给地主房住，满想靠地主，所以给张景亭藏大方桌。”接着说：“靠地主一辈子是个穷光蛋，靠共产党有吃又有穿”。但仍有观望和等待的，现翻委会继续布置力量，深入动员，提倡自报和暗报，并喊出：“对地主过筛子又过箩”的口号，进行反复的检查运动。（子元、英林）
