　　Taihang Second District Workers' Union
    Responds to Challenge from Changzhi Workers
    [Our Newspaper] After all cadres of the Taihang Second District Workers' Union read the challenge letter from the Changzhi City Workers' Union to launch a revolutionary friendship competition, they were very excited and expressed their complete agreement with their challenge competition, and had great confidence in fulfilling it by "August 1st." Based on the characteristics of the district's vast area and the dispersed nature of rural small factories, a response plan was formulated, and challenges were also issued to the Xingtai City and Taihang Workers' First and Third Sub-Unions. The competition conditions were determined as follows: (1) 100% of all factories directly under the Taihang Workers' Second Sub-Union will participate in the movement. In mining, due to the vast area and dispersed workers, ensure 75% participation in the movement. In iron industry, ensure 70% participation in the movement. In small handicrafts, there are 30 factories with more than 10 people in the entire district, ensure 80% participation in the movement. (2) Comprehensively transform four directly subordinate factories, achieving the five principles of "sufficient raw materials, low cost, large quantity, good quality, and wide sales channels," democratically manage factories, strive to save raw materials, and establish the workers' sense of ownership. In mining, ensure 55% labor-management cooperation, and be able to improve quality, increase quantity, improve technology, improve worker-peasant relations, and establish the idea of worker-peasant solidarity. In iron industry, ensure 50% labor-management cooperation, do not be conservative with technology, achieve improved technology and transformed products, meet the needs of the masses, and take care of the interests of the masses. In small factories, ensure 65% labor-management cooperation, implement democratic management, improve worker-peasant relations, and workers establish the perspective of serving the masses; in rural small-scale textile industry, convert 30% of earthen machines to foreign machines, achieving large quantity, good quality, and mutual benefit for both parties. (3) According to the characteristics of this district, it is necessary to develop a large number of small-scale industries in the form of all-inclusive cooperatives. There are currently five cooperatives in this form, and this time it is necessary to develop them to twelve, and at the same time, ensure the combination of industry and agriculture, accurately calculate labor, solve the labor difficulties of semi-farming and semi-working, and achieve mutual benefit between workers and peasants. (4) All small handicrafts in the towns of the seven counties must be organized to participate in the production movement, and at the same time, it must be guaranteed to supply textile tools and all farm tools for the masses. (5) In addition to the existing mining industry, it is guaranteed that 45 new kilns will be built in six counties, and all coal will be mined by this winter. (6) Branch cadres must first clearly understand the "February 7th" editorial in the People's Daily, and patiently help lower-level cadres to get through the workers' thinking. Production organs at the district level will study the industrial development situation irregularly, summarize experiences in time, and constantly solve the difficulties in the movement, so that the movement will gradually improve. All staff and workers should reach out to the masses, establish models, promote the overall situation, further improve their work ability, and cultivate more cadres loved by the masses. (7) The challenge and response will both last for four months from April 1st to August 1st.
