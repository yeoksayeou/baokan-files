　　Linze Cadres Rely on the Masses
    to Persist in On-the-Spot Struggle Against the Enemy
    [This paper's Ji-Lu-Yu 9th dispatch] This time, when the enemy invaded Linze, the local cadres relied on the masses and persisted on the spot, dividing into groups of three or two, hiding among the masses. After the enemy's "Home-Returning Corps" entered the village, they could not find any working staff or the Eighth Route Army, so they declared, "The Eighth Route Army has gone far away and will never come back this time." They forced the masses to return all the land and grain that had been distributed to them to the landlords. However, at night, the working staff appeared before the masses, and the masses immediately spread the word: "I saw the district head coming, the director hasn't left yet!" Upon hearing this, the landlords hurriedly returned the things they had taken back to the masses the next day, and explained to the masses, "I didn't do anything bad!" When cadres stayed in a village, the masses immediately sent special people to inquire about information and report the situation. The democratic order in the vast countryside of Linze remains the same. The landlords honestly implement government decrees.

　　临泽干部依靠群众
    就地坚持对敌斗争
    【本报冀鲁豫九日电】此次敌人进犯临泽，当地干部依靠群众，就地坚持，分散为三、二个人一组，隐蔽在群众中，敌人“还乡团”进村后，见不到工作人员和八路军，便扬言“八路军走远了，这次可回不来了”。并强迫群众将分配的土地粮食统统归还地主。但夜里工作人员便出现在群众面前了，群众马上一传十、十传百：“我见区长来，主任没有走呢！”。地主闻讯，第二天就赶快把倒回的东西归还群众。并向群众表白说：“我可没办坏事啊”！干部住到那村，那村群众即派专人探信报告情况。临泽的广大乡村民主秩序依然如故。地主老老实实的执行政府法令。
