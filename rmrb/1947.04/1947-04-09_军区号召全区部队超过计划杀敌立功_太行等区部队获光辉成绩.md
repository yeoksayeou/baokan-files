　　The Military Region Calls on All Troops to Exceed Planned Enemy Kills and Achieve Merit
  　Taihang and Other Regions Achieve Glorious Results
    [Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] The Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Military Region called on all military region troops to exceed the plan for killing the enemy, exceed the plan for capturing the enemy, and exceed the plan for seizing enemy weapons, and launched a movement to kill the enemy and achieve merit. The Ji-Lu-Yu and Ji-Nan Military Region troops, who were the first to respond to this call, have reported their plans for killing the enemy in April, May, and June to the Greater Military Region; troops from other military regions are also responding.
    [Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] Local troops in Taihang, Taiyue, and Ji-Lu-Yu are enthusiastically carrying out a kill-the-enemy and achieve-merit competition with glorious results exceeding their tasks by one to three times. In the kill-the-enemy competition from December to February, the troops of the Third Sub-district of Taihang annihilated thirteen companies and two platoons of the enemy, killing and wounding 191, capturing 640, and seizing 61 light and heavy machine guns, one small cannon, and 453 rifles, exceeding the unit's kill-the-enemy plan by two times. The Fourth Sub-district annihilated five companies and seven platoons of the enemy, exceeding the kill-the-enemy task by nearly one time. The Tai Gu Independent Battalion and the Shouyang Independent Battalion of the Second Sub-district also exceeded their tasks, annihilating five platoons of the enemy. The ×× Regiment of the Ji-Lu-Yu local troops killed and wounded 105 of Chiang Kai-shek's regular troops in January, captured 350, and seized 4 light machine guns, 3 grenade launchers, and 239 rifles, exceeding the task by three and a half times. Other regiments also completed the kill-the-enemy tasks ahead of schedule. In late February, the kill-the-enemy competition movement in Taiyue was expanded from the military region's local troops to various guerrilla corps; the guerrillas of the Second Sub-district in the region, in the machine gun seizure competition, annihilated 40 Chiang Kai-shek soldiers, seized 4 machine guns, 1 grenade launcher, and 14 rifles in ten days. This movement is continuing to be carried out in depth in various places.
    [Dispatch from This Newspaper, Ji-Lu-Yu, 5th] The Ji-Lu-Yu Military Region recently issued a circular calling on the military and civilians throughout the region to launch a kill-the-enemy and achieve-merit movement. The circular first pointed out that in the past three months, thanks to the active guerrilla warfare carried out by our military and civilians behind enemy lines, the enemy's transportation was disrupted, the reactionary armed forces and the enemy who went out to "suppress" were severely attacked, and the rear area positions were always persisted in. The Fifth Sub-district has continuously achieved victories in the struggle against the enemy and is worthy of praise and learning. In the future, it is even more necessary to defend Chairman Mao and defend the land with the movement to kill the enemy and achieve merit. Each sub-district should formulate the kill-the-enemy tasks for the next three months based on the specific situation, and call on the military and civilians throughout the region to annihilate 7,500 enemy soldiers in the next three months. The circular also pointed out that the work of all levels of organs in the future should focus on this task, understand the situation of the troops in a timely manner, summarize experience, promote the completion of this task, and use this as the standard for evaluating merit. Some comrades believe that there is no merit to be gained in the work of the organs, which is completely wrong. Merit evaluation should be clear in rewards and punishments, improve morale, unite together, and strive to complete this task.

　　军区号召全区部队超过计划杀敌立功
  　太行等区部队获光辉成绩
    【本报特讯】晋冀鲁豫军区号召各军区部队超过杀敌计划、超过俘虏敌人的计划、超过缴获敌人武器的计划，展开杀敌立功运动。首先响应这一号召的冀鲁豫与冀南军区部队已将四、五、六三个月杀敌计划报告大军区；其他军区部队也正在响应中。
    【本报特讯】太行、太岳、冀鲁豫地方部队，以超过任务一倍至三倍的光辉成绩，热烈开展杀敌立功竞赛。太行三分区部队，在十二月至二月的杀敌竞赛中，歼灭敌人十三个连又两个排，计毙伤一九一人，俘六四○人，缴轻重机枪六十一挺，小炮一门，步枪四五三支，超过该部杀敌计划的两倍。四分区共歼敌五个连又七个排，超过杀敌任务将近一倍。二分区太谷独立营与寿阳独立营亦超过任务，歼敌五个排。冀鲁豫地方部队××团，一月份毙伤蒋正规军一○五人，俘三五○人，缴轻机枪四挺，掷弹筒三个，步枪二三九支，超过任务三倍半。其他各团，亦提前完成杀敌任务。二月下旬，太岳杀敌竞赛运动，又由军区地方部队扩展至各游击兵团；该区二分区游击队，在缴机枪的竞赛下，十天即歼蒋军四十人，缴机枪四挺，掷弹筒一个，步枪十四支。现这一运动正在各地继续深入开展。
    【本报冀鲁豫五日电】冀鲁豫军区顷发出通令，号召全区军民展开歼敌立功运动。该通令首先指出：过去三个月来由于我敌后军民积极开展游击战争，破坏敌交通，严重打击了反动武装，及外出“清剿”之敌，始终坚持了敌后阵地。五分区对敌斗争不断取得胜利，是值得表扬学习的。今后更要以歼敌立功运动保卫毛主席、保卫土地。各分区根据具体情况制定今后三个月的杀敌任务，号召全区军民，今后三个月歼敌七千五百名。通令同时指出：各级机关今后工作应以这一任务为中心，及时了解部队情况。总结经验，推动这一任务的完成，并以此作为立功评定的标准。有些同志认为机关工作无功可立，是完全错误的。立功评定要赏罚严明，提高斗志，上下团结一起，为完成这一任务而奋斗。
