　　【Taiyue, April 7th (Our Newspaper)】Old Mrs. Zheng, a model military family member from Maju Village in Shimin County, has been harmoniously managing her household and diligently working with her daughter-in-law since her son joined the army, overcoming all difficulties and declining the village's preferential treatment. Last spring, during sowing season, she and households with livestock exchanged labor to plant millet and corn. During the summer, she and her daughter-in-law personally handled thinning seedlings and weeding. Sometimes, village cadres wanted to help, but she resolutely refused. Once, her son sent a letter from the front, saying that his unit was practicing martial arts and couldn't come home. She hurriedly went to the school to find a teacher and said, "Please write a letter for me to my child, telling him not to worry about the family and to practice martial arts well, so he can defeat Chiang Kai-shek's army and come back. Without them winning battles on the front lines, we wouldn't have a home." Last winter, she and her daughter-in-law earned enough from spinning and weaving alone to cover their food and drink. Last autumn, they harvested three *shi* of grain and didn't touch a single grain. This spring, she and her daughter-in-law are still running around weaving cloth for women who can't weave and fixing looms. Under her influence, all twenty-five military families in the village are also actively and voluntarily engaging in production.

　　马莒军属郑老太太
  　勤劳治家谢绝优待
    【本报太岳七日电】士敏马莒村模范军属郑老太太，自儿子参军后，与媳妇和气治家，勤俭劳动，解决一切困难，谢绝村上对她的优待。去春下种时，她与有牲口户变工种上了谷子、玉茭，夏季拔苗、锄草都是她婆媳两亲自下手。有时村干部要去帮助，她亦坚决谢绝。一次，她儿子从前方寄回一封信来，说他们部队正在练武，顾不上回家。她急忙跑到学校找教员说：“请你代我写封信给我娃，叫他不要记念家里，好好练武，打垮蒋介石的军队好回来，没有他们在前方打胜仗，就没有咱家。”去冬她婆媳二人仅纺织赚利即够吃喝；去秋打的三石粮食一颗也没动。今春他婆媳两人还东跑西奔的为不会织布的妇女织布，收拾机子。在她的影响下，全村二十五户军属亦积极的自动生产。
