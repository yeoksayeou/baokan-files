　　Report from our newspaper: Generals Liu Bocheng, Commander of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Military Region, and Deng Xiaoping, Political Commissar, have issued a proclamation and distributed it in various newly recovered towns. The original text is as follows:

　　The bandit Chiang Kai-shek's crimes are obvious: During the eight years of the War of Resistance, he was passive and hesitant, losing territory and retreating to Sichuan and Kang. Thanks to the valiant resistance of our army and people, and the cooperation of our allies, the Japanese invaders surrendered. After the victory of the War of Resistance, rest and recuperation were in order, and peace and democracy were the aspirations of the whole country. Unexpectedly, the bandit Chiang had other intentions, with a warlike nature and as a dictatorial demon; suppressing democracy and persecuting the loyal and good; secretly ordering the "suppression of the Communists," and clamoring to "accept surrender." The resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference were solemn and grand, but he signed with his right hand and tore them up with his left! He advanced troops into the Central Plains, sabotaging liberation, and turning Su, Lu, Jin, and Yu into battlefields. Selling out the country is unparalleled: Territory and sovereignty are offered to the US side; airspace and territorial waters are sold out together; American goods are imported, flooding the market; industry and commerce are collapsing, and agriculture is in panic. He stationed American troops, treating them as emperors, protecting them in cases of rape and robbery; in exchange for American weapons, he waged a rampant civil war, conscripting soldiers and levying taxes, causing suffering throughout the country! Our army's purpose is to protect the country and defend the people, and the eight years of resistance are world-renowned. We oppose selling out the country, for national survival; oppose dictatorship, for the spirit of democracy; oppose civil war, seeking only peace. We have repeatedly exercised restraint, with great effort and consideration. The bandit Chiang Kai-shek, fond of disorder and warfare, brought his large army to press upon us, which was truly intolerable. For self-defense, we struck back at the Chiang army. With the unity of the army and the people, and with one heart and one mind, we have repeatedly defeated the Chiang army in recent months. The bandit Chiang does not repent and will be severely punished! Wherever our army goes, discipline is strict, public buying and selling are practiced, and the people are protected; the economy is restored, and people's livelihood is stabilized; industry and commerce are developed, and the market is prosperous; land reform is carried out, liberating the peasants; freedom of thought is promoted, and culture flourishes; special agents are abolished, and politics are clean and bright. Chiang's army officers and soldiers, awaken as soon as possible, abandon the war and return, and all will be welcomed! Patriotic people, recognize right and wrong, save the motherland, and never leave regrets for future generations! Those who have strayed should repent and reform; those who are obstinate will cut themselves off from the people. The democratic movement is rising like the sun, and the patriotic tide is surging. The victory of the people's army is certain; the collapse of dictatorial rule is approaching. All my compatriots, rise up and respond quickly, unite as one, and with concerted efforts, eliminate the dictatorship and bring peace to the world.
