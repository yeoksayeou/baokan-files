　　"Only Under Chairman Mao's Leadership is There Truth"
　　Weixian County Peasants, Having Overturned Their Lives, Remember Their Benefactor
　　[This newspaper's Jinan dispatch, 5th] "Children have their own parents, we cannot forget the Communist Party's kindness," these are two sentences that the peasants of Anshang and Chadao villages in Weixian County often say after turning their lives around. Zhang Fengkui, a child from Anshang, was eight years old when the great famine struck. They sold all their farm tools, but still couldn't make a living. His mother took him to escape the famine to the south of the Yellow River. In order to let Fengkui escape with his life, she reluctantly gave Fengkui to someone else. She struggled there for a while and had to return alone. Last year, between April and May, the land reform movement unfolded in various parts of Jinan. He took the official document from the democratic government to the south of the Yellow River and brought his child back. Someone asked him how he got him back, and he said, "There is also a democratic government there, otherwise, getting my child back would be harder than climbing to the sky?" During the famine years, Shi, an old man from Chadao Village, fled to the south of the Yellow River. There, he gave his two daughters (one fourteen years old and one four years old) to someone else in exchange for some food. Last year, he also took the official document to the south of the Yellow River and brought his children back. He often said to his neighbors with irrepressible joy, "Wherever Chairman Mao's leadership reaches, there is truth. Adults can see their children, and children have their own parents. We cannot forget the Communist Party's kindness."

　　“毛主席领导才有真理”
  　威县农民翻身念恩人
    【本报冀南五日电】“孩子有了亲爹娘，共产党的恩不能忘”，这是威县安上、岔道两村农民翻身后常常说的两句话。安上儿童张凤魁，八岁时正赶上大灾荒，农具都卖光了，仍是无法维持生活，他母亲便带着他逃荒到黄河南，为叫凤魁逃个活命，便忍痛把凤魁给了人家。她在那里混了一个时期，只好独自回来。去年四五月间，冀南各地土地运动展开，他便拿着民主政府的公事到黄河南把孩子领回来了。有人问他怎么领回来的，他便说：“那里也是民主政府，要不然想领孩子比登天还难？”岔道村史老汉在灾荒年逃荒到黄河南，到那里把两个女孩子（一个十四岁，一个四岁）给了人家，换了一点粮食。去年他拿着公事到黄河南也把孩子领回来了。他常常喜不自禁的对邻人说：“毛主席领导到那里，那里便有真理，大人能见孩子，孩子有了亲父母，共产党的恩不能忘”。
