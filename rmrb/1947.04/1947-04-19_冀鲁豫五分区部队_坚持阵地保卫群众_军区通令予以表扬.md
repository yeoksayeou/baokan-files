　　Troops of the Fifth Sub-district of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Military Region
    Persist in Defending Positions to Protect the People
    Military Region Issues Commendation
    [Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] The Jinji-Luyu Military Region recently issued a commendation to all troops of the Fifth Sub-district of Hebei-Shandong-Henan. In recent operations, we bravely held our positions, protected the interests of the people, and crushed an "encirclement and suppression" campaign by a superior enemy force. The first time was in the middle of last month (from the 11th to the 20th), when the entire 143rd Brigade of the Chiang Kai-shek army "swept" through the central areas of our Fifth Sub-district, including Qibin and Kaocheng. We counterattacked at every turn, and the panicked Chiang Kai-shek army dared not advance rapidly. They encamped every day at noon and hastily built fortifications. At night, they lit firewood, fearing our attacks. Our army and guerrillas, persisting in the struggle in the central areas, bravely fought the enemy twenty-four times, finally defeating them completely. On March 24th, the 143rd Brigade of the enemy army launched a second "sweeping" operation in the area. Wherever they went, they temporarily set up strongholds, adopting tactics of going out early and returning late, dividing forces to combine attacks, surrounding at dawn, and capturing at night. Our Party and government cadres and county and district armed forces all relied on the masses to persist in guerrilla warfare in the central areas, protecting the safety of the masses and rural order. At this time, our sub-district corps also coordinated with local armed forces to organize retaliatory counterattacks, launching attacks on all enemy strongholds and communication lines. The enemy headquarters in Zhuangzhai, Dongming, was also destroyed by our bombardment, one stronghold was captured, and the entire Chiang Kai-shek district government was annihilated by us. By April 5th, the invading Chiang Kai-shek army, under our powerful counterattacks, had fled south completely. The results of the battle are being cleared. The following experiences are summarized from the victory after two counter-"sweeping" operations: (1) Closely relying on the masses, persisting in the struggle in the central areas, and at the same time, cooperating with the main force on the outer lines to launch fierce attacks on the enemy's supply lines and command organs, and flexibly adopting the method of dispersed guerrilla warfare and concentrated annihilation of the enemy, can smash the enemy's "sweeping" operations, protect the interests of the masses, and consolidate rural order. (2) In the gaps between the two "sweeping" operations, intensify the organization of militia, establish joint defense, suppress the counterattacks of reactionary elements and landlords, and prepare for the next victorious counter-"sweeping" operation.
    [Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] A part of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Local Corps, on April 1st, at Sunzhijia, southeast of Caoxian County, annihilated six squads of the 220th Regiment of the 74th Brigade of the 55th Division of the Chiang Kai-shek army, killing and wounding more than 30 people including the company commander, capturing 16 people including the platoon leader, and seizing three light machine guns, one grenade launcher, more than ten rifles, and 6,000 rounds of ammunition. On April 4th, a part of the forward armed forces of the Third Sub-district, at Dawuzhuang, north of Shanxian County, killed and wounded more than ten Chiang Kai-shek army soldiers including the company commander, and seized one light machine gun and dozens of rifles.

　　冀鲁豫五分区部队
    坚持阵地保卫群众
    军区通令予以表扬
    【本报特讯】晋冀鲁豫军区顷通令表扬冀鲁豫五分区全体部队。我们在最近的作战中，英勇的坚持了阵地，保卫了群众利益，粉碎了一次优势敌人的“扫荡”。第一次是在上月中旬（十一日——二十日），蒋军一四三旅全部，向我五分区腹心区齐宾、考城等地“扫荡”，我节节予以反击，恐慌的蒋军不敢长驱前进，每天正午即行驻营，并赶修工事。夜间即点起柴火，怕我袭击。坚持腹地斗争的我军及游击队，曾英勇与敌作战二十四次，终将敌全部击溃。三月二十四日，敌军一四三旅又向该区进行了第二次“扫荡”，所到之处，即按上临时据点，采取早出晚归：分兵合击、拂晓周围、夜间捕捉。我党政干部及县区武装，均全部依靠群众坚持腹地游击战争，保护了群众安全和农村秩序。我分区兵团，此时亦协同地方武装，组织报复反击，向进攻敌人所有据点交通线进攻，东明庄寨敌指挥部亦遭我轰毁，攻克据点一座，蒋记区署全部为我歼灭。至四月五日，进犯蒋军在我有力反击下，即全部南窜，战果正清查中。总结两次反扫荡后的胜利，有如下经验：（一）紧紧依靠群众，坚持腹地斗争，同时配合外线主力，向敌方补外线、指挥机关猛烈进攻，并灵活的采取分散游击与集中消灭敌人的方法，就可以粉碎敌人“扫荡”，保护群众利益，巩固农村秩序。（二）在两次“扫荡”的空隙，加紧组织民兵，建立联防，镇压反动分子和地主的反攻，准备下一次进行胜利的反扫荡。
    【本报特讯】冀鲁豫地方兵团一部，于四月一日在曹县东南孙志家，歼灭蒋军五十五师七十四旅二二○团六个班，毙伤连长以下三十余，俘排长以下十六人，缴轻机枪三挺，掷弹筒一个，步枪十余支，子弹六千发。四月四日，三分区前方武装一部，在单县以北的大吴庄，毙伤蒋军连长以下十余人，缴轻机枪一挺，步枪数十支。
