　　Land Assessment Based on Work Points, Work as Shares
　　Renzhuang Organizes All Labor
　　Absorbs Semi-Labor for Short-Term Assignments
　　Saves Full Labor for Production
　　[Our newspaper, Licheng News] Renzhuang Village in the Second District is located on the Handan-Changzhi Highway, and there are more corvée duties. In order to better integrate corvée service with production, labor hero Shen Yuqin and model cadre Shen Dazang actively cooperated with the masses to humbly study and further created a new method of using labor by assessing land based on work points, assessing tasks based on work, and using work as shares to unify the use of labor. The entire village has a production committee to uniformly grasp leadership, uniformly print work tickets, and uniformly pay wages, with settlements and dividends distributed by team every season of the year. For example, the labor hero Shen Yuqin's team has a total of 642.6 mu of land, including 223.2 mu of wheat land and 419.4 mu of autumn land. They divided the land into three grades according to the distance and whether it was scattered or consolidated, and the amount of labor saved by the crops. A total of 10,222.5 work days were assessed for the whole year. The team has 37 full male laborers, 13 semi-laborers, 11 auxiliary laborers, 37 full female laborers, 12 semi-laborers, 14 auxiliary laborers, 10 mules, and 7 donkeys. In terms of assigning work, agriculture is based on the speed and strength of labor, and work is assigned according to the task. Transportation is calculated at one work point per 100 jin of weight carried, and corvée service and participation in war are calculated at one work point per person per day. The entire team uses labor uniformly, and one work point is counted as one work point, and one work point is entered as one work share. At the same time, regulations were established to reward those who go out for work with a daily allowance (determined by the price of goods and actual needs for each period). The total profit from sideline occupations, after deducting travel expenses, is distributed as dividends based on the surplus work points (surplus work points refer to the number of work points earned in addition to the work that should be done on one's own land). No dividends are distributed if there are no surplus work points, and those who are short of work points must make up the difference according to agricultural wage rates. In this way, the more shares one invests, the more dividends one receives, which encourages everyone's production enthusiasm and willingness to invest in shares, and also expands the scope of corvée service. The entire village has absorbed 22 old men and 21 children, a total of 43 auxiliary laborers, to participate in corvée work that they can handle, saving unnecessary labor for full laborers, which is used for agricultural production. People who go out for work are also very reassured, they feel that the livestock are taken care of (also fixed people to feed and use), and the land is being managed. At the same time, the military dependents' land that the entire village should cultivate on their behalf is also uniformly distributed according to the number of laborers each team should provide, so that the military dependents' land is even more secure. At present, in addition to the four people participating in the war, the entire village's labor force: 76 full male laborers, 27 semi-laborers, 29 auxiliary laborers, 86 full female laborers, 18 semi-laborers, 40 auxiliary laborers, 22 mules, 2 oxen, and 25 donkeys are engaged in sideline occupations and agriculture, and those providing corvée service are providing corvée service. A vigorous and bustling atmosphere prevails, without the slightest disorder. (Jiang He, Xiu Shan, Shun Qing, Guang Bei, Shu Ling)

　　按地评工以工入股
    仁庄组织全部劳力
    吸收半劳力支短差
    省下全劳力搞生产
    【本报黎城讯】二区仁庄村在邯长公路上，差务比较多。为了支差生产结合得更好，劳英申玉芹、模范干部申大赃积极协同群众虚心研究，在劳力合作上进一步创造出按地评工，按活计工，以工入股统一使用劳力的新办法。全村有生产委员会统一掌握领导，统一制印工票，统一工资，以队为单位，一年按四季结账分红。如劳英申玉芹大队，共地六百四十二亩六分，内有麦地二百廿三亩二分，秋地四百十九亩四分。他们根据地的远近零整，作物的省费工，分为三等；每等堪定了标准地，共评出全年用工一万零二百廿二个半，全队共有男全劳力三十七个，半劳力十三个，辅助劳力十一个，女全劳力三十七个，半劳力十二个，辅助劳力十四个，骡子十头，驴七头。在做活计工上，农业以劳力的快慢强弱，按活计工；运输以载重百斤计一工，支差参战以每人一天计一工。全队统一使用劳力，做一工计一工，计一工入一工股。同时规定奖励出外的人畜每天路费数（以每个时期的物价及实际需用数定之）。副业总盈利除去路费以全队贯入工股的余工数分红（余工数是指除去自己地该用工余做的工数），不余工则不分红，缺工者按农业工资数补出来。这样入股愈多，分红亦愈多，既鼓励了大家的生产情绪与入股劲头，支差的面也扩大了。全村共吸收了廿二个老汉，廿一个儿童，共四十三个辅助劳力，参加了自己能胜任的差务工作，节省了不必要用全劳力支差的工，用到了农业生产上。出外的人也很放心，他们觉得牲口有人管（也固定了人喂与使用），地有人经营。同时全村该代耕的军属地也按每队应代耕劳力统一分配了地数，使军属的地更有了靠墙。目前全村除了参战的四人外，全村劳力：男全劳力七十六个，半劳力廿七个，辅助劳力廿九个，女全劳力八十六个，半劳力十八个，辅助劳力四十个，骡二十二头，牛二头，驴二十五头，搞副业的搞副业，搞农业的搞农业，支差的支差，轰轰烈烈的一股热气，一点都不紊乱。（江河、秀山、顺庆、光北、书令）
