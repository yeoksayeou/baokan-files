    The Struggle Against the Enemy in the Border Area of Gaoyi
    (I) Holding the Banner of the Border Area – Xujiazhuang
    Xujiazhuang is the northernmost village in Gaoyi, only a dozen li away from the enemy's stronghold, but it remains unyielding. All kinds of work are still carried out as usual. The masses have basically been liberated, and they are now taking advantage of the lull in the war to carry out the work of "leveling, supplementing, and thoroughly eliminating feudalism." Although the "Homecoming Corps" frequently operates there, the people there have not been intimidated. They are actively thinking of ways to defend their homes and protect the fruits of their liberation. Their method of protecting livestock is very good. They block all the street entrances in the village, leaving only one street entrance for large carts to pass through, and divide the long street into several sections, each with doors and bunkers. This method has long been adopted by the entire county of Gaoyi. At the same time, the village's explosive movement is also better, with landmines and stone mines everywhere. At the merit-awarding meeting, the county headquarters awarded them the title of "Banner of Border Area Struggle."
    (II) Cleverly Wounding the "Homecoming Corps" with Explosives
    Li Quanxi, the vice chairman of the Farmers' Association of Xihanzhuang, is very firm in his struggle against the enemy. The "Homecoming Corps" has been repelled several times from his village. Once, more than a hundred enemies arrived in Xihanzhuang. He persisted in the struggle on the blockhouse. Among the "Homecoming Corps" was Zhao Fu, who knew Li Quanxi before. Seeing Quanxi on the blockhouse, he said to Quanxi, "Now that things have come to this, surrender your gun and I guarantee you'll be fine." Quanxi quickly replied, "Surrendering the gun is fine, come closer and see if the gun is broken." Zhao Fu believed it was true and went to the base of the blockhouse to receive the gun. Seeing him coming over, Quanxi quickly threw down two grenades, and Zhao Fu was wounded. The other members of the "Homecoming Corps" began shooting at the militia blockhouse. But the militiamen had already drilled into the tunnels. After a while, the enemies rushed up to the blockhouse. One enemy wanted to go down the tunnel, but just put his foot down and then retracted it. Comrade Quanxi saw the enemy at the tunnel entrance afraid to go down, and became very anxious, so he took a grenade and threw it out of the tunnel entrance, and another enemy at the entrance was wounded. Later, supporting militiamen arrived, and the enemies fled to Yuanshi in a panic.
   (III) Wang Choufu's Determined Will
    Wang Choufu, the village chief of Wangliangzhuang, is active and responsible in his work in the village. As soon as he heard gunfire at night, he led the militia to support. Once, special agents came to his village and captured his mother, forcing her to shout at the base of the militia blockhouse. But Wang Choufu always said, "I will die before surrendering my gun." As he spoke, he picked up a grenade and threw it at the enemy. Seeing the grenade being thrown, the enemy didn't bother to pull his mother and ran to the side. His mother quickly entered the blockhouse.

    高邑边地的对敌斗争
    （一）坚持边地的旗帜——徐家庄
    徐家庄是高邑最靠北的一个村子，离敌人的据点只有十多里路，可是他依然屹然不动，各种工作仍照常进行，群众大体翻了身，现正乘战争的空隙搞“填平补齐彻底消灭封建”的工作。虽然“还乡团”经常到那里活动，但是那里的人民并没有被吓倒，他们在积极的想办法去保卫家乡保卫翻身的果实。他们的保护牲口办法很好，把全村的街口都堵了，只留一条街口能过大车，并在很长的街道中分成数段，各段都有门和堡垒，这种办法早已被高邑全县所采用。同时他村里的爆炸运动也较好，到处都有地雷、石雷。在立功会上，县指挥部奖给他们“边地斗争的旗帜”的称号。
    （二）巧计炸伤“还乡团”
    西韩庄农会副主席李全喜对敌人斗争很坚强，“还乡团”几次到他村都被打退了。一次一百多敌人到了西韩庄，他在炮楼上坚持斗争，“还乡团”中有一个赵福，以前认识李全喜，他见全喜在炮楼上，便对全喜说：“现在到了这步田地，缴了枪我保证你没事”。全喜很快的答道：“缴枪行了，你过来些，看把枪弄坏了”。赵福信以为真，便到炮楼根去接枪，全喜见他过来，很敏捷的摔下两颗手榴弹，赵福被炸伤了。其他“还乡团”便对着民兵炮楼打起枪来。民兵们却早已钻了地道。敌人打了一会，于是冲上了炮楼，有一个敌人想下地道，刚下去脚，又缩回去了，全喜同志在地洞下看着敌人不敢下了，非常着急，便拿了一个手榴弹从洞口掷出，洞口的敌人又被炸伤了一个。后来支援民兵赶到，敌人仓慌逃往元氏。
   （三）意志坚决的王丑福
    王良庄村长王丑福，在村中工作积极负责，晚上一听打枪，便带领民兵去支援。有一次特务到他村，把他娘捉住，逼着她到民兵炮楼根喊话。但王丑福总说“我死了也不缴枪。”他边说边拿起手榴弹照着敌人掷去，敌人见掷下手榴弹，顾不着拉他娘就跑到一边去了。他娘却很快的进了炮楼。
