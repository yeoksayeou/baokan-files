Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 12th. American imperialism is actively pursuing a policy of expansion. To date, it has obtained aviation rights in fifteen countries and seized a large number of air bases. According to a US Information Service dispatch from Washington on the 10th, the US Overseas Liquidation Commission recently announced that the United States has completed aviation rights agreements with fifteen countries. These agreements include the disposal of surplus overseas materials. In most cases, surplus materials shipped by the United States to other countries are used as a bargaining chip for the United States to obtain aviation rights. This agreement includes China.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 10th. Reuters, Washington: The US State Department announced on the 3rd of this month that the United States has responded to the Iranian government's request and intends to sell some surplus military supplies to the country to support its reactionary government. The US Export-Import Bank is currently considering a loan of 28 million US dollars to Austria and has approved a credit loan of 70 million US dollars to Hungary to help it purchase approximately 38,000 bales of US cotton.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 10th. TASS, Athens, 8th. The Legislative Committee of the Greek Parliament has recently passed a 50-year lease agreement between the Greek government and the American "Mining Cooperation" company for 11,000 hectares (equivalent to 220,000 Chinese acres) of Thracian bauxite mining area. This is the first batch of privileges seized by US imperialism from Greece under the smokescreen of aiding Greece in "anti-communism."

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 11th. According to a United Press report, the US Department of Commerce recently announced that the Foreign Liquidation Commission had loaned Japan 15 million US dollars to purchase surplus US military supplies in Japan. This is a further measure by US imperialism to actively help the revival of Japanese militarism, and it comes at a time when Japan is about to hold general elections, which is extremely noteworthy.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 8th. Washington: US President Truman, at a Democratic luncheon on the 5th, once again delivered a speech on his "new foreign policy," claiming that the United States must "aid" countries threatened by "foreign pressure" and "secret infiltration," and raved that this new foreign policy is an extension of the Monroe Doctrine, and that the United States must maintain a strong military and a sound domestic economy to match this responsibility. The US imperialism's mad attempt to dominate the world has been fully exposed.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 8th. New York: The United Nations Security Council passed a resolution on the evening of the 2nd to allow the United States to have sole strategic trusteeship over the former Japanese mandated islands in the Pacific (Note: According to the Japanese mandated islands approved by the old League of Nations on December 17, 1920, these are all German islands north of the equator, with a total area of 2,149 square miles, the main ones being the Mariana, Marshall, and Caroline Islands.). During the discussion, the United Kingdom proposed an amendment suggesting that UN member states enjoy equal commercial rights in these islands. US representative Austin said that this guarantee "endangers" the "strategic security" of the United States in these islands, and threatened that the United States would withdraw from the trusteeship agreement. Thus, the ambition of US imperialism to dominate the Pacific is once again fully revealed.

　　美国奴役世界野心昭然若揭
    已攫取十五国航空权
    竟以“剩余”军火售予日本和伊朗反动派
    【新华社陕北十二日电】美帝国主义积极推行扩张政策，截至现在为止，已取得了十五个国家的航空权利，攫取了大量航空基地。据美新闻处华盛顿十日电：美国国外清理委员会顷公布，美国已完成对十五国家之航空权协定，此项协定包括海外剩余物资的处置问题。美国运抵他国的剩余物资，在多数情形下，均充作美国取得航空权利的交换条件。此项协定包括中国在内。
    【新华社陕北十日电】路透社华盛顿讯：美国务院本月三日发表美国已应伊朗政府之请求，拟将部分剩余军用品售予该国，以支持该国反动政府。美国进出口银行刻正考虑对奥地利贷款二千八百万美元，并已批准贷予匈牙利信用贷款七千万元，助其购买约三万八千包美棉。
    【新华社陕北十日电】塔斯社雅典八日电：希腊国会立法委员会顷已通过希政府与美国“矿业合作”公司间所签订之一万一千海克脱（合二十二万华亩）色雷斯铝矿区的五十年出租协定。此为美帝国主义在援希“反共”的烟幕下，自希腊攫取之首批特权。
    【新华社陕北十一日电】据合众社报导：美商务部最近宣布，对外清算委员会曾对日本贷款一千五百万元，以购买美军在日之剩余军用物资。按此为美帝国主义积极帮助日本军国主义复活之进一步措施，且其时适在日本行将举行大选前夕，其用心极堪注意。
    【新华社陕北八日电】华盛顿讯：美总统杜鲁门于五日在民主党员午宴会上，再度发表关于其“新外交政策”之演讲，声称：美国必须“援助”受“国外压力”及“秘密渗入”威胁之国家，并狂言此种新外交政策即为门罗主义之引伸，美国必须维持强大之军力及良好之国内经济，使与此项责任相称。美帝国主义统治世界之狂妄企图，已暴露无遗。
    【新华社陕北八日电】纽约讯：联合国安理会已于二日晚通过准许美国对太平洋前日本委任统治各岛（按：根据一九二○年十二月十七日旧国联所批准的日本委任统治各岛，为全部德属赤道以北之岛屿，面积共二一四九方里，其主要者为马利安纳，马绍尔，加罗林群岛。）作单独之战略性托管。讨论中英国曾提出一修正案，建议联合国国家在各该岛享有平等商业权利，美代表奥斯汀谓此种保证“危害”美国在各岛之“战略安全”，并声言美国将退出托管协定以为威胁，英国修正案乃被否决。于此美帝国主义独霸太平洋之野心，又一次表露无遗。
