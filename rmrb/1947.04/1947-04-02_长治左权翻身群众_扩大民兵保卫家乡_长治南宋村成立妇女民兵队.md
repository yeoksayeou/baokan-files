[Taixing, from our newspaper, 31st] Along with joining the army, the liberated masses in Changzhi, Zuoquan, and other counties are actively participating in the militia. In Nansong Village, Changzhi, during a discussion of current affairs, when the director of the village armed forces committee said, "To defend ourselves, simply expanding the army is not enough. We also need to strengthen the militia to monitor landlords, eliminate special agents, and remove the ears and eyes of the Chiang gang in order to live a good life," thirty-seven liberated masses immediately signed up to join the militia, bringing the total to more than seventy, including those who had already joined. A women's militia team was also established. The liberated woman Li Xiancui was the first to join, saying, "To eliminate the Chiang gang and live a good life, last July, my husband and I mobilized my brother Hu Cheng to join the army. This time, we mobilized my husband to join the army again, and now I am also joining the militia." Influenced by her, thirty-two women joined the militia on the spot. After review by the masses, a total of one hundred and four good male and female militiamen from poor peasant and farm laborer backgrounds were selected. The new militiamen held a solemn oath-taking ceremony to the masses. After paying respects to Chairman Mao, Wang Suanlao said first, "I am joining the militia to protect the good life of my family after liberation. I will never give up until the reactionaries are eliminated." Then Wang Xiaofa said, "I want to monitor special agent landlords, remove the ears and eyes of the Chiang gang, and also participate in the war and engage in good production." Every militiaman who swore an oath was full of energy and high in spirit. After the masses in Zuoquan were liberated, old men, lazy men, and backward farmers also actively requested to join the militia. Han Fengxiang, over fifty years old from Baiyingsi Village, said, "In the past, I thought I was old and could not do anything. Now that I am liberated, although I am old, my heart is not old. I also have a responsibility to protect the country and defend my home. I want to join the militia." Li Erhai and his four sons, who were considered backward in the village in the past, also joined the militia after this liberation. Shi Sanhai, who has poor eyesight, was not allowed to join the militia by everyone. He argued with everyone with a red face, and as a result, he finally became a self-defense team member. Zhao Jincheng from Songshuping, a well-known lazy man in the Third District, became an activist after liberation and also scrambled to join the militia this time. He said, "In the past, I didn't want to move because I had nothing to eat or wear. Today, I have food and clothing, so why shouldn't I protect this good life?"

[Reported by our newspaper] In the two joint defense zones of Tongtan and Aikou in Zuoquan, eleven administrative villages, through the in-depth implementation movement of this period, and after the great unity of the peasants and the strengthening of peasant class education, the peasants' consciousness has been raised. The liberated peasant Yuan Jinfu said, "I am sixty-four years old this year and have suffered fifty years of hardship for the landlord. Today, I have finally been liberated. I am endlessly grateful to Chairman Mao and the Eighth Route Army. Hearing that Chiang Kai-shek wants to prevent us from being liberated is really infuriating. We must expand the armed forces. I want to join the militia and fight Chiang Kai-shek to the end. Although I cannot go to the front line, I can stand guard and be a sentinel in the rear." Under the influence of this old man, the young Jia Zhenru also joined the militia. The woman Yan Donglan said, "I am an outsider. In the past, no one in the village looked up to me. Today, I have a position and have been selected as an activist. Chiang Kai-shek does not want our women to have a position, so I will also join the militia." In one night, a total of sixty-four people signed up to join the militia. In the eleven administrative villages, a total of one hundred and seventy liberated peasants joined the militia. (Fu Wen)

    长治南宋村成立妇女民兵队
    【本报太行三十一日电】与参军同时，长治、左权等县翻身群众并积极参加民兵。长治南宋村在讨论时事中，当村武委会主任谈到“为保卫自己，单纯扩大军队不够，还需要壮大民兵监视地主，肃清特务，挖掉蒋贼耳目才能过好生活”时，立即便有三十七名翻身群众报名参加民兵，连以前的已达七十余名。并成立了一队妇女民兵，翻身妇女李先翠首先参加，说：“为消灭蒋贼过好光景，去年七月，我和我男人动员兄弟胡成参军，这回又动员俺男人参军，现在我也参加民兵。”在她影响下，当场三十二个妇女参加了民兵。经过群众审查，选出贫雇中农成份的好男、女民兵共一百零四名。新民兵并向群众举行庄严的入队宣誓。先向毛主席行礼后，王拴牢首先说：“我参加民兵，为了保护自己家庭翻身后的好生活，不消灭反动派誓不甘休。”接着王小发说：“我要监视特务地主，挖掉蒋贼耳目，还要参战，好好生产。”个个宣誓民兵，均精神饱满，情绪高涨。左权群众翻身后，老汉、懒汉、落后农民，亦都积极要求参加民兵。柏营寺村五十多岁的韩凤祥说：“过去我认为我老了，干不了事，现在翻了身，我人老心不老，保国卫家我也有一份责任，我要参加民兵。”该村过去被认为落后的李二孩父子四人，这次翻身后也都参加了民兵。眼睛不好的石三孩，大家不叫他参加民兵，他红着脸和大家吵，结果终算当了个自卫队员。三区出名懒汉松树坪赵金成翻身后，变成积极分子，这次亦抢着参加了民兵。他说：“过去没吃没穿不想动，今天有吃有穿，我为啥不保卫这好光景？”
    【本报讯】左权桐滩、隘峪口两联防十一个行政村，在这期深入贯彻运动中，经过农民大团结，加强农民阶级教育，提高了农民觉悟。翻身农民原金福说：“我今年六十四岁，给地主受过五十年苦，今天才翻了身，感谢不尽毛主席八路军，听到蒋介石要不叫咱翻身，真是气死人，咱们非扩大武装不可，我要参加民兵和蒋介石干到底，虽然不能到前线，我能在后方站岗放哨。”在这老汉影响下，连着有青年贾振儒也参加了民兵。妇女阎东兰说：“我是外来人，过去我在村没人看起来，今天有了地位，并选了我积极分子，蒋介石不叫咱们妇女有地位，我也参加民兵。”在一夜当中共报名参加民兵六十四人。十一个行政村，共一百七十位翻身农民参加民兵。         （甫温）
