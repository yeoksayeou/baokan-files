　　Famous Literary Figure A Ying's Eldest Son
    Comrade Qian Yi Dies a Martyr
    Qian Yi, the eldest son of the famous literary figure A Ying, and special correspondent for the Xinhua News Agency's Yanfu Branch and the Yanfu Daily, heroically sacrificed himself while upholding the people's cause by maintaining a rear newsfront in the areas occupied by the Chiang Kai-shek's army. On the 2nd of this month, while conducting interviews in the Shítáng District in the southern suburbs of Huai'an, he was unfortunately captured by the Chiang Kai-shek's army during a breakout. When the Chiang Kai-shek's army forced him to "repent," Comrade Qian Yi sternly replied, "You are not qualified to talk to me!" He also said, "You can shoot me, but I will never repent." The next day, he calmly gave his life outside Shítáng Town. Qian was only twenty-three years old, a formal member of the Chinese Communist Party, and had been engaged in rural drama and journalism since coming to the Subei Liberated Area in 1942. He was once selected as a model worker for the Yanfu First Branch. When the tragic news arrived, the comrades of the branch and the newspaper were extremely grieved. The Huai'an County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party decided to rename the place where Comrade Qian Yi died as Qian Yi Township to permanently commemorate him.

　　名文学家阿英长子
    钱毅同志殉国
    名文学家阿英的长子，新华社盐阜分社及盐阜日报社特派记者钱毅同志，因坚持蒋军侵占区后方新闻阵地，为人民服务，于本月二日在淮安南郊石塘区采访时，在突围中不幸被蒋军俘去后英勇牺牲。当蒋军迫其“自新”时，钱毅同志即厉声回答：“你们没有资格和我谈话！”又说：“＠可枪毙，绝不自新。”次日即在石塘镇外从容就义。钱年仅二十三岁，中共正式党员，自一九四二年来苏北解放区即从事农村戏剧及新闻工作，曾被选为盐阜一分社模范工作者。噩耗传来，分社及报社同志万分悲痛，中共淮安县委并决定以钱毅同志殉国处易名钱毅乡，以资永久纪念。
