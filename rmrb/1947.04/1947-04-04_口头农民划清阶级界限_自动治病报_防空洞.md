Column: Launch a Peasant Solidarity Movement, Clearly Define Class Lines, and Thoroughly Overthrow Landlords

    [This newspaper's Jixian dispatch] After several re-examinations of the turn-over in KouTou Village, the cadres all realized there were no problems, but all the work could not be promoted, and some good cadres were worried and helpless.

    The leadership went deep into the poor and hired masses to understand the situation, and only then discovered many cases of fake pledges, fake sales, fake struggles, fake distribution, and landlords' property being preserved. Based on this situation, they brewed and discussed among the cadres, activists, and the entire village: Should the turn-over be carried out? Is it reasonable to eliminate landlords? The leadership further pointed out: Preserving the landlord's things is a disease planted by the landlord in us, proposing the slogan "The landlord plants the disease, don't blame yourself," "If you are sick, treat it, if you don't treat it, you will die," and launched a disease treatment movement. Everyone was mobilized to say: "Let's open a big hospital, whoever is sick will be treated, as long as the report is clear, the treatment is guaranteed to be good." The cadres and activists took the lead in reporting, saying: "There is a disease in my heart, I can't sleep in the middle of the night, I can't eat, I can't work wholeheartedly, if I don't say it, I will really suffocate." The masses then began to talk about it. However, many people only reported furniture, clothes, and other items, and concealed the land they were hiding. At this time, the leadership pointed out again, "If you report small illnesses, are there still big illnesses?" and called on everyone to "inspect each other and treat each other's illnesses." "Those who speak out should be praised." Then they reported everything they had preserved for the landlord.

    In the "disease treatment" movement, women played a big role, actively reporting themselves and persuading others, dividing into groups to carry out mutual persuasion, and competing with men's groups. Many women returned home to persuade their own men. The women themselves shouted slogans at mass meetings: "Men and women turn over together, men and women both progress." When the women rose up, a broad mass family mutual persuasion turn-over movement was formed. This movement greatly exercised the masses, and everyone resolutely separated from the landlords. There are still a few who are being deceived, and the masses are now carrying out continued persuasion to achieve complete unity and eliminate feudalism. (Qiao Pu)

　　口头农民划清阶级界限  自动治病报“防空洞”
    【本报汲县讯】口头村经过几次翻身检查，干部都认识没问题了，但是一切工作推动不起来，一些好的干部发愁没办法。
    领导上深入到贫雇群众了解，才发现了许多假当、假卖、假斗争、假分配、给地主保存财产现象。依据这种情况，便在干部积极分子及全村群众中酝酿讨论：翻身应该不应该？消灭地主合理不合理？领导上更指出：保存地主东西是地主给咱种的病，提出“地主种病，不怨自己”、“有病就治，不治要命”的号召，开展治病运动。动员大家说：“咱们开个大医院，谁要有病谁就治，只要报的清，保险治的好。”干部积极分子首先自报说：“心中有块病，半夜睡不着，吃饭吃不到肚，干活干不到心，再要不说出，真要闷死。”群众便接着都谈了。但很多人只是报些家具、衣服等件，隐瞒的土地不谈。这时领导上又指出，小病报了，是否还有大病，号召大家“互相检查，互相治病”。“说出来的要受表扬。”接着才又报出给地主保存的一切东西。
    在“治病”运动中，妇女起了大作用，踊跃自报，并劝说别人，分成小组，展开互相劝说，并与男人小组比赛，许多妇女回到家中劝说自己的男人，妇女们自己在群众大会上高呼：“男女齐翻身，男女都进步”的口号。妇女起来了，形成广大群众性的家庭的互相劝说的翻身运动。这一运动对群众的锻炼很大，大家都坚决与地主分了家，还有少数被蒙蔽的，现群众正在开展继续的劝说，达到完全团结自己消灭封建。（乔浦）
