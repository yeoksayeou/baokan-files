The hundreds of cadres sent by Commander-in-Chief Gao of the Military and Civilian Construction Army to study at the Military and Political University have made great progress after several months of study. During their studies, they saw through the ugliness of the old society and the old army. They realized that only the Communist Party is China's only savior, and that only by struggling for China's independence, peace, and democracy under the leadership of the Communist Party is there a bright future. After their initial ideological awakening, they universally launched a "speak bitterness" movement, in which everyone indignantly denounced the oppression and suffering inflicted upon them by the old society and the old army under the rule of the four major families. Many comrades, when speaking of their pain, gnashed their teeth and wept bitterly. Comrade Li Tianyou said, "I had nowhere to speak of these pains in the past, nor did I dare to speak of them. Now, under the leadership of the Communist Party, I dare to speak of anything. I will resolutely serve the people." After the "speak bitterness" movement, many people felt the warmth of the Communist Party, recognized their path, and handed over the political documents they had preserved for many years to the organization of their own accord, determined to sever ties with the old society and the old army under the rule of the Chiang family. Some comrades even voluntarily confessed to the organization some problems they had concealed from the organization in their ideology and history after the uprising. Many people took the initiative to revise and correct their autobiographies, and even more took the initiative to talk to the person in charge of the organization. Now, their spirits are very happy, singing never stops, and they hold entertainment evenings every week. Each class collectively writes and performs short plays, quick talks, and drumsongs to show the learning life, ideological struggle, and ideological progress in the class, criticizing backwardness, praising progress, criticizing shortcomings, and showing models, etc., integrating entertainment with learning and thought, serving learning and ideological transformation.

　　军大民建军干部学习有飞跃进步
    【本报讯】民建军高总司令送到军政大学学习的数百位干部，经过几个月学习，现已有很大进步。学习中，他们看透了旧社会旧军队的丑恶；体会到只有共产党才是中国的唯一救星，只有在共产党领导下为中国的独立和平民主事业奋斗，才是唯一的光明出路。思想初步觉醒之后，普遍展开了诉苦运动，大家愤激的控诉了四大家族统治下的旧社会旧军队给予自己的压迫与痛苦。许多同志诉到痛处，都咬牙切齿，痛哭流涕。李天佑同志说：“我这些痛苦，过去没处诉，也不敢诉；现在，在共产党领导下，我什么也敢诉了，我要坚决为人民服务。”经过诉苦运动，不少人体会到共产党的温暖，认清自己的道路，纷纷把保存多年的政治文件自动交给组织，决心与蒋家统治下的旧社会旧军队割断瓜葛。有一部分同志更自动向组织坦白了自己起义后，在思想上历史上对组织隐瞒着的一些问题。自动要求修改和更正自传的很多，主动找组织负责人谈心的更多。现在，他们的精神十分愉快，歌声不停于口，每礼拜开娱乐晚会，各班集体自编自演，以短剧、快板、大鼓等形式，表现班里的学习生活，思想斗争，思想进步过程，批判落后，表扬进步，批判缺点，表现模范等，把娱乐与学习、思想结合起来，为学习和改造思想服务。
