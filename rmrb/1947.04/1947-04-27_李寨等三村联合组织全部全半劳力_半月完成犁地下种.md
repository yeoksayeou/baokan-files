　　【This newspaper, Taiyue, 25th dispatch】 The three villages of Lizhai, Pingquan, and Wangchengtou in Jincheng, under the leadership of labor hero Liu Baocheng, formed a joint mutual aid brigade and completed plowing and sowing in half a month, starting from April 1st. The three villages are extremely short of labor and animal power. Each laborer needs to cultivate more than 30 mu of land, and each animal needs to cultivate 100 mu of land. In addition, supporting the front line makes the labor force even more insufficient. They organized 100% of the full and half laborers and finished plowing all the autumn fields before the spring rain. In Wangchengtou, one-third of the land was plowed by people pulling plows, and each mu was plowed twice. Since the start of spring plowing, the three villages have stopped holding unnecessary large meetings and entertainment to reduce the fatigue of cadres and the masses. The reports of each group are made during dinner time, discussing matters while eating. Problems within the group are mostly resolved during rest time in the fields and on the road. They also organized family members of military personnel and cadres to participate in production, reducing the burden of substitute farming. Among the 59 military and cadre families in Lizhai Village, 12 voluntarily canceled the preferential treatment of substitute farming, and the remaining military families also cultivated part of the land themselves. In order to solve the contradiction between participating in the war and production, a mixed organization was adopted, with unified work points and increased wages for participating in the war. Militiamen earned 12 points per workday, civilian laborers earned 11 points, full laborers earned 10 points when producing, and half laborers earned less accordingly. Animal power plowing two mu of land was counted as one workday, and preference was given to the families of martyrs, military personnel, and cadres, followed by militiamen and civilian laborers participating in the war, and finally the general public. Women were encouraged to participate in agricultural production, and women in Wangtoucheng also participated in pulling plows. In the half-month of production, some problems were also discovered that need to be overcome urgently: (1) A few cadres despise labor and do not participate in labor. Some even rely on mutual aid groups for substitute farming under the pretext of being busy with official duties, which makes the masses dissatisfied. (2) Insufficient education within the group leads to frequent disputes. (3) There are still unfair phenomena in requisitioning labor, which affects the mood for production. For example, cadres of state-owned stores and cooperatives do not provide labor and ask mutual aid groups to farm on their behalf, which the masses are dissatisfied with. (4) Some remaining problems from the land reform need to be resolved. Some middle peasants suffered some losses during the land reform movement, which affected their mood for production and should be appropriately compensated.

　　李寨等三村联合组织全部全半劳力
    半月完成犁地下种
    【本报太岳二十五日电】晋城李寨、坪泉、望城头三村在劳动英雄刘保成领导下组成联合互助大队，自四月一日开始，半个月完成犁地下种。该三村劳畜力异常缺乏，每个劳力需耕种三十多亩土地，每头畜力需耕地百亩，加以支援前线，劳力更显不足。他们把全半劳力百分之百的组织起来，春雨前即将全部秋地耕完。望城头用人拉犁耕地三分之一，每亩还犁了两遍。自春耕以来，三村均停止召开不必要的大会与娱乐，减少干部与群众疲劳。各组汇报，均在晚饭时间，一面吃饭一面议事。小组内的问题，多在地里休息时间与路上解决。并组织军干属参加生产，减少代耕负担。李寨村共五十九户军干属，即有十二户自动取消代耕优待，其余军属亦均自耕一部。为解决参战与生产的矛盾，采取混合组织，统一计工，提高参战工资。民兵一工顶十二分，民夫一工顶十一分，全劳力生产时一工顶十分，半劳力依此减少。畜力犁地二亩为一工，耕种时先给烈、军、干属，再给参战民兵、民夫，最后是一般群众。鼓励妇女参加农业生产，望头城妇女，也参加了拉犁。在半个月的生产中，也发现了一些问题亟待克服：（一）少数干部轻视劳动，不参加劳动。甚至借口公事忙，靠互助组代耕，致使群众不满。（二）组内教育不够，不时闹纠纷。（三）支差仍有不公现象，影响生产情绪。如公营商店、合作社的干部等不支差，并要互助组代耕，群众均表不满。（四）土地改革中一些遗留问题尚待解决。个别中农在土地改革运动中受了些损失，影响了生产情绪，应予适当补偿。
