　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, April 24th: TASS, Moscow reported on April 14th that Moscow and Delhi officially announced that the Soviet government and the Indian government have agreed to exchange diplomatic envoys with the rank of ambassador. The magazine "Soviet New Era" pointed out: This is of international significance and a demonstration of the two peoples' sincere friendship and mutual respect, marking India's move towards an independent policy. Indian democrats have long been promoting the establishment of diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, and this friendly relationship will benefit both countries. However, Anglo-Indian reactionaries are trying to undermine the Indian people's sympathy and interest in the Soviet Union through a recent and particularly intense anti-Soviet movement. However, the conspiracies of the enemies of international peace and friendship have failed to prevent the establishment of Soviet-Indian diplomatic relations.

　　苏印交换外交使节
    【新华社陕北二十四日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：四月十四日莫斯科与德里官方同时宣布苏联政府与印度政府同意交换大使衔的外交使节。苏新时代杂志著称指出：这是有国际意义的、是两国人民彼此友好诚意相待的证明，标志着印度正走向独立的政策。印度民主人士早已在策进与苏联建立外交关系，这种友谊关系将对两国均有裨益。但是英印反动分子正努力以近来特别剧烈的反苏运动暗中破坏印度人民对苏联的同情与兴趣。但是，国际和平与友谊的敌人之阴谋，并未能阻止印苏外交关系的建立。
