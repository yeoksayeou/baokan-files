　　Entering the Kingdom of the Local Tyrant
　　An Anatomy of the Jiang Family's Rule in Northern Henan (Part 2)
　　·Li Pu·
　　On the evening of April 5th, I followed the army to Daba Corner Village in the Junxian County, five miles east of the Pinghan Railway. Another unit under General Liu Bocheng's command was besieging the stronghold of Hu Quanlu, one of the local tyrants in northern Henan, which was only a dozen miles away. The sound of cannons and the light of fire were very clear. This place was exactly Hu Quanlu's "fiefdom." We knocked on the doors of the common people and asked them to share a room for us to stay overnight, and repeatedly told them not to be afraid.
　　"Don't be afraid, don't be afraid," my landlord replied, "I know you are a good army."
　　We hadn't had time to tell him that we were the Eighth Route Army, so we deliberately asked, "Do you know what kind of army we are?"
　　"No matter what kind of army, will it be bad if you're fighting Hu Quanlu?" he replied seriously.
　　This was the first time I heard Hu Quanlu's "subjects" express their opinion of Hu Quanlu. Later, I interviewed many common people, and the answer was consistent: "If the Eighth Route Army doesn't come, we won't be able to survive." Why? "Everything is taken away, everything to eat and use is taken, and if each mu of land doesn't yield one stone of grain, Hu Quanlu will take one stone, two or three dou." How exactly was it taken, and what was taken away? An old man replied with disgust, "He takes whatever he can think of."
　　Hu Quanlu opened a shop in Pangcun called a cooperative, and the firewood and transportation tools and labor used were all shared by the baojia with the common people. The little kingdom has its own little bureaucratic capital, crows are black all over the world, that's what it means.
　　I stayed one night in Huotang, near Pangcun. The landlord, Fan Shutong, used to be an old school teacher, and used to have sixty mu of good land, which Hu Quanlu forcibly bought from him at the price of one dou of grain per mu, and then forcibly bought his seven tiled houses and five thatched houses for three dou of grain. "If he wants it, what can you do!" The old man shook his head and didn't speak for a long time. He has nothing now.
　　And Hu Quanlu, who knows how much land he has now? No one can say for sure. Many common people said: In the past year or two, they would rather give him the land to avoid levies. They believed that Hu Quanlu would not last long. So close to the Eighth Route Army, it would be good to get it back when the Eighth Route Army came. But Hu Quanlu just stopped wanting land. The common people said, "Why does he need to buy it, isn't it the same as his own!"
　　Mr. Fan told me that the seventy households in Huotang have to send sixteen dan of grain and two tons of coal money to Hu Quanlu every month. He repeatedly and certainly replied to me that this was what Hu Quanlu wanted himself, and the quotas allocated to him by the township office were still outside. I asked him how he knew. He said, "Of course I know, I am a scholar, and I sometimes do some writing and calculation for the bao." So, are there any specific names for these grains and coal? No. This is his "fiefdom," and this is the "tribute" that his "subjects" should offer, that's all!
　　However, Mr. Fan also said that he wasn't so unscrupulous when the Japanese devils were here. At that time, he only asked for two dou of grain per mu of land each year. Why is it like this now? Mr. Fan seemed to think my question was too superficial, and replied in the tone of an old man teaching a young man: "When General Jiang came, he supported him." Especially in North China, Chiang Kai-shek is more fragile than Okamura Neji, so his dependence on local tyrants like Hu Quanlu is even greater than that of Okamura Neji. This is a truth that anyone with a little brain would understand.
　　Since last autumn, Hu Quanlu started building a school in Pangcun, which has not yet been fully completed. I went to visit it. It is a large three-courtyard tiled house. Although it is very rustic and not suitable for use as a school, the scale is very large. He forcibly demolished the dozens of houses that originally stood on the site, making more than a dozen families homeless, without giving any compensation. All the bricks, tiles, lime, beams, pillars, doors, windows, iron nails, firewood, etc., as well as miscellaneous expenses, were allocated by the nearby townships and baojia. Hu Quanlu sent people to each bao and jia to supervise and urge. The first bao where the Pangcun Township Office is located, with more than 120 households, has already produced more than 12,000 bricks and other items, and more than 1,600 laborers, and each person has to take care of their own meals.
　　According to incomplete materials, in March, June, and August of last year, he built and repaired fortifications three times, using a total of 1,000 man-days, 470,000 bricks, 5,000 jin of lime, thousands of pieces of wood, and other materials such as adobe, dry stalks, wheat straw, etc. …, were burdened on the three nearby towns of Juqiao, Pangcun, and Shentun by the Junxian County government. No wonder the common people said, "Everything is taken away."
　　His funds, supplies, etc. were allocated by the Jiang-affiliated Henan Third Special Commissioner's Office to the neighboring counties, mainly Junxian, which was his basic fiefdom. Except for the funds, for which no traceable accounts could be found, statistics from the Special Commissioner's Office's notices show that in the past twelve months, a total of more than 139,000 dou of military grain, 90,000 jin of horse fodder, more than 260,000 jin of horse grass, and more than 1.5 million jin of firewood were used, as well as a cotton-padded clothing fee of more than 16 million yuan. But the actual amount received was far more than this. For example, in October last year, the Special Commissioner's Office ordered the allocation of more than 10,500 jin of grain, but he "long-borrowed" more than 11,900 jin; ordered the allocation of 1,500 jin of straw, but he "long-borrowed" ten times as much, totaling 16,800 jin; and ordered the allocation of 900 jin of bran, but he "long-borrowed" more than a hundred times as much, totaling 10,080 jin. For such a local tyrant, the county magistrate and township head would of course obey his orders.
　　In addition to the labor, which was of course borne by the peasants, all the grain and money were apportioned according to the land tax and military pay. But the poor households were not any easier, because the proportion of farmers who truly did not even have a mu of land was very small. The vast majority were households with large populations but insufficient land. In addition, we must add the extortion of the yamen runners and the corruption of the township and bao chiefs. The actual burden on the common people was probably more than doubled. The Hu family soldiers who were captured this time told me that since this year, Hu Quanlu had only given them 1,000 yuan in legal tender each, but when the People's Liberation Army authorities kept the legal tender for them later, they almost all had 7,000 or 8,000 yuan, and some even more. Where did this money come from?
　　In February and March of last year, Hu Quanlu went to Xinxiang and was detained by a certain aspect in Xinxiang, saying that he had done many evil deeds and someone had formally accused him. As a result, he paid a large sum of money to redeem himself. His engineering company commander who was captured this time confirmed this incident for me, but he didn't know exactly how much money was paid. It turned out that this was a case of a large warlord extorting a small warlord, a foreign tyrant shaking down a local tyrant.
　　Is all this news, or history from the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods?

　　进入土霸王的王国
    豫北蒋家天下的解剖之二
    ·李普·
    四月五号晚上，记者随军到达平汉路东侧五华里浚县县境的大八角庄，刘伯承将军麾下另一个部队正在包围豫北土霸王之一扈全禄的老巢，相距不过十多华里，炮声和火光十分清晰。这地方正是扈全禄的“采邑”。我们叫开老百姓的门，请他们分一间房子让我们住一晚，又再三叮嘱他们不要害怕。
    “不害怕，不害怕。”我的房东回答说：“我知道你们是好队伍。”
    我们还没有来得及告诉他我们是八路军，因此故意问道：“你知道我们是什么队伍？”
    “不管是什么队伍，打扈全禄的还会坏吗？”他严肃地回答说。
    这是我第一次听到扈全禄的“臣民”发表对扈全禄的意见。以后记者陆续访问了许多老百姓，答复是一致的，“八路军再不来，咱就活不下去了。”为什么呢？“啥也给要去了，吃的用的啥也要光了，每亩地打不到一石粮食，扈全禄要去了一石二三斗。”究竟是怎么要的呢，要去了些什么呢？一个老头儿厌恶地答道：“想不出的他就不要。”
    扈全禄在庞村开了一家美其名曰合作社的商店，所用的柴草和运输货物的工具和人工，都是由保甲向老百姓分担的。小小的王国里便有小小的官僚资本，天下乌鸦一般黑，便是这个意思吧。
    我在邻近庞村的霍堂住了一晚，房东范树桐从前是一位老教书先生，以前有六十亩好地，给扈全禄以每亩一斗粮的价格强买了去，又以三斗粮强买了他的七间瓦房和五间草房。“他要，你有啥法子！”老人家摇了一摇头，好久不说话，他现在什么也没有了。
    而扈全禄呢，现在究竟有了多少地，谁也说不清楚，许多老百姓说：这一两年来他们情愿把田地送给他，免得摊派。他们相信扈全禄总不会长久，隔八路军这样近，八路军来了再要回来好了。可是扈全禄偏偏不再要地了。老百姓说：“他为啥要买，还不是他自己的一样！”
    范老先生告诉我：霍堂七十户人家，每月要送十六担粮食和两吨煤的钱给扈全禄。他一再肯定的答复我，这是扈全禄自己要的，乡公所摊派给他的还在外。我问他怎么会知道。他说：“我当然知道，我是读书人，保上有时候写写算算，也找找我。”那么，这些粮和煤有什么名目没有呢，没有。这里是他的“采邑”，这是他的“臣民”应该献纳的“贡赋”，如此而已！
    但是，范老先生又说：鬼子在这儿的时候他还没有这样肆无顾忌。那时候他每年只向每亩地要二斗粮。为什么现在会这样呢？范老先生似乎很以为我这个问题太浅薄，用老先生教年轻人的口吻回答说：“蒋老总来了，他硬帮了。”特别是在华北，蒋介石比冈村宁次更要脆弱，因此对扈全禄之类土霸王的依赖，比冈村宁次更要重大，这是一个人稍稍用点脑筋都会明白的道理。
    从去年秋天起，扈全禄开始在庞村建筑一座学校，现在还没有全部完工。记者去参观过，是一栋三进的大瓦房。虽然很土气，更不合学校之用，规模却十分庞大。他强迫拆除了那块地基原有的几十间房，使十几户人家流离失所，而丝毫不给任何代价。所有砖瓦、石灰、梁柱、门窗、铁钉、柴草等等，还有杂支费都由附近的乡镇保甲摊派，由扈全禄派人到各保各甲坐催。庞村乡乡公所所在地的第一保一共一百二十多户人家，已经出了一万二千多个砖以及其他等等，又出了一千六百来个工，而且要各人自己管饭。
    根据不完全的材料，去年三月、六月、八月，他修筑和修补了三次工事，共计用了一千个人工，砖石四十七万块，石灰五千斤，木料数千根，其余还有土坯、干棵、麦秸等……，由浚县政府拨给邻近的巨桥、庞村、申屯等三个乡镇负担，难怪老百姓们说：什么都要光了。
    他的经费、给养等等是由蒋记河南第三专署拨给邻近的县份负担的，主要的是浚县，这是他的基本采邑。除经费一项没有找到可查的账目外，从专署的通知书中统计，去年十二个月共用军粮十三万九千多斗，马干九万斤，马草二十六万多斤，柴草一百五十多万斤，还有一笔棉衣费一千六百多万元。但实收数绝不止此，比如去年十月专署令拨粮一万零五百多斤，他却“长借”了一万一千九百多斤，令拨谷草一千五百斤，他却“长借”了十倍，计一万六千八百斤，令拨麸料九百斤，他却“长借”了一百多倍，计一万零八十斤。对于这样一位土霸王，县长乡长当然都要唯命是听。
    除了人工当然由农民负担外，所有的粮款，都按田赋的饷银摊派，但是穷户并不会比较轻松一些，因为真正连一亩田地也没有的农户，所占比例数很少，最大多数是人口多而田地不够，此外我们还要加上差役的勒索和乡保长的贪污，老百姓的实际负担，恐怕再加上一倍也不多。这次被解放的扈家兵士们对我说，今年以来扈全禄仅给他们每人发了一千元法币，可是后来解放军当局代他们收存法币的时候，他们几乎都有七八千元，有的还更多一些，这些钱是那儿来的？
    去年二三月间，扈全禄到新乡去了一趟，给新乡某方面扣押起来，说他作恶多端，有人正式控告。结果是出了一大笔钱才赎了回来。这次俘虏的他的工兵连长，肯定的为我证实了这件事，只是不知道究竟出了多少钱。原来这是大军阀勒索小军阀，洋霸王敲土霸王的竹杠。
    所有这一切，究竟是新闻呢，还是春秋战国时代的历史呢？
