　　Growing Up From the Masses
    Introducing Wang Baosheng, Model Cadre of Lingchuan
    [This newspaper Lingchuan News] All cadres in Lingchuan County acknowledge that Comrade Wang Baosheng has methods for leading the liberation movement and can deeply connect with the masses. Wang was forced into becoming a kiln worker after being bankrupted by debt. He was only liberated after the Eighth Route Army recovered Lingchuan. Initially, he served as a village chief and is now the chairman of the farmers' association. The characteristics of his work style are: he can integrate with the masses, lives a simple life, wears patched-up plain clothes, and is very good at discovering problems among the masses. Once, while working in Shiyaodong, others went but couldn't find any problems, but after he went, he visited families one after another, asking the masses what problems they had. Later, at the child's home (who was a hired worker), after much back and forth, they talked about the white and fine willow branch hanging on the wall. The child said: "I wanted to weave this into a covering (for scooping noodles), but I haven't found anyone to do it." Baosheng said: "I'll weave it, bring it here!..." The child stubbornly refused, but Comrade Baosheng insisted on weaving it. After it was woven, the child gave him a bowl of rice soup to drink. While drinking the rice soup, they started chatting, and after much back and forth, they exposed the fact that the village public security officer was shielding someone. After understanding the situation, he helped the cadre save face and improved the relationship between the cadres and the masses, and also dug up the landlord's air-raid shelter. Last December, during the county-wide movement to sweep away feudalism, he was working in Xiaofandi. Jing Jinbao, the chairman of the Zhao× village farmers' association, wanted to give him 1,000 yuan, but he resolutely refused and urged other district cadres to also refuse the spoils. During the distribution of the struggle fruits in Xiaofandi, he firmly advocated using poverty as the standard for distribution and actively worked to unite the thoughts of the cadres and activists. He has demonstrated a positive and exemplary role in various tasks. (Wu Aiwei)

　　从群众中生长起来
    介绍陵川模范干部王保盛
    【本报陵川讯】陵川全县干部会，公认王保盛同志领导翻身有办法，能深入群众。王系被债务所逼，倾家荡产后当了窑工的，八路军收复陵川才翻了身，起初当村长，现在当农会主席，他工作作风的特点：是能和群众打成一片，生活朴素，穿着补补绽的便衣，很会在群众中发现问题。一次在石窑洞工作，别人去却发现不了问题，他去后便东家出来西家去，访问群众到底有啥问题。后来在娃孩家（是雇工）扯来扯去，就说到墙上挂的一把白细的柳条了，娃孩说：“这条是我想编一个罩笠（捞面用具），还没找下人。”保盛说：“我去编，拿来！……”他硬不叫，保盛同志非要编；编成后娃孩给他舀一碗米汤叫喝，喝着米汤就扯起来了，扯来扯去就扯出村公安员包庇的事来。情况了解后，便很好的帮助干部洗了脸，改善了干群关系，又挖了地主的防空洞。去年十二月，全县扫封建大运动，他在小翻底工作，赵×村农会主席井金保拿着一千元要给他，他坚决不收，并劝勉别的区干部亦拒收果实。小翻底分配斗争果实时，他坚决主张以穷为标准来分，并积极去打通干部积极分子思想。他在各种工作中都表现了积极模范作用。（武艾巍）
