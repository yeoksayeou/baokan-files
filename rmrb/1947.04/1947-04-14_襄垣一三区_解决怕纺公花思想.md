　　Xiangyuan First and Third Districts
    Solve the Ideological Problem of Fearing to Spin Public Cotton
    [This newspaper, Xiangyuan News] When the First and Third Districts initially called for the 100-Day Spinning Movement, spinning groups were established on the surface, but the ideological problems of the women had not been resolved, and they were spinning lazily and without enthusiasm. After in-depth inspection, the following problems were discovered: (1) Spinning for the public does not benefit oneself. For example, Sun Haishui of Daping Village in the Third District said: "In the beginning, I was always afraid of spinning for the public. If I had known I was spinning for myself earlier, I would have joined a mutual aid group sooner." (2) Let's spin after we've finished wearing the fruits of our labor! Lian Qiuhua, a liberated woman from Nantianzhang in the First District, said: "I was given a lot of clothes during the mass movement. Let's talk about spinning after I've finished wearing them. I don't want to get rich." (3) Afraid of being struggled against if they become rich. Zhao Jixian of Fucun in the Third District is a rich peasant who had his "tail" cut off in the mass movement. This time, he didn't spin in the spinning movement because he was afraid of being struggled against if he spun too much. (4) Poor integration with the family. For example, women in Nantianzhang established a spinning group last year, but did nothing at home, which hurt the relationship between husband and wife and made the family not united. The leadership carried out ideological education to address the above problems, and all the ideological problems of the women were resolved, greatly increasing their enthusiasm for spinning. In the First District, twenty spinning groups with one hundred and fifty-two women spinners spun one thousand one hundred and sixty-four jin in twenty-four days. In the Third District, twenty villages with four thousand four hundred and fifty-four women earned a net profit of thirteen thousand three hundred and thirty-six jin of cotton in fifteen days.

　　襄垣一三区
    解决怕纺公花思想
    【本报襄垣讯】一、三区在一开始号召百日纺织运动时，表面上都成立了纺织组，但妇女思想问题还没有解决，纺起花来都是懒洋洋的不起劲。深入检查，发现如下几个问题：（一）给公家纺于自己没利。如三区大平村孙海水说：“在一开始我总怕是给公家纺，我早知是给自己纺时，可该早些参加互助组来”。（二）穿完了果实再纺吧！一区南田漳翻身妇女连秋花说：“我在群运中分了好多衣服，穿完了再说纺吧，我又不希望发财”。（三）发了财怕挨斗争。三区付村赵计先是个富农，群运中割了尾巴，这次在纺织运动中就不纺，怕纺多了再斗争。（四）和家庭结合不好。如南田漳妇女去年成立了纺织组，回家啥也不干，夫妇感情不好，家庭不团结。领导上针对以上问题做了思想教育，妇女思想问题全部得到解决，纺织劲头大起来。一区二十个纺织组一百五十二个纺妇，二十四天内纺一千一百六十四斤。三区二十个村，四千四百五十四个妇女，十五天内净赚花一万三千三百三十六斤。（李住旺、刘启明）
