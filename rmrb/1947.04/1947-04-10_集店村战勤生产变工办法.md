　　Jidian Village War Effort Production Labor Exchange Method

　　[This newspaper's Huguan News] Jidian in the First District, in order to overcome unfair labor service, specifically had all villagers jointly research: a method of greatly exchanging labor between front and rear for war participation, support, and production of people and animals. The report is as follows, for reference in various regions.

　　In agricultural production: calculate work points based on actual tasks, with each work point equivalent to five *xiang* (a unit of time). During spring plowing, a person pulling a plow for eight *fen* (a unit of area) is equivalent to one work point, with the individual providing their own food. An animal plowing one *mu* (another unit of area) is equivalent to one work point, including the work of the plowman. Landlord households are not responsible for animal feed, only for providing food for the plowman, and the land must be plowed well. Other miscellaneous tasks are calculated based on this standard. Work points are increased if the standard is exceeded. The standard for calculating work points in each season's production is determined through group discussion.

　　War participation: Militiamen participating in war and self-defense teams carrying stretchers are all considered war participation. Those who bring their own provisions receive one and a half work points in agriculture for each work point outside. Those provided provisions by the public receive one work point for one work point.

　　Support the Front:
　　1. Voluntary transportation: Human labor carrying 60 *jin* (a unit of weight) for 60 *li* (a unit of distance) within three days is equivalent to one and a half agricultural work points. Beyond three days, carrying 50 *jin* for 60 *li* is equivalent to one and a half work points (due to the increased distance requiring more dry rations). Animal labor pulling 100 *jin* for 50 *li* is equivalent to one person's work point, including the cart driver's work. However, for each animal traveling 50 *li* pulling 100 *jin*, the headquarters will issue one *jin* of black beans and three *jin* of grass. More will be issued for pulling more, using this as the standard.
　　2. Substitute labor: Human labor is calculated at one work point per day for carrying 60 *jin* for 60 *li*. From the wages of the substitute, deduct the cost of rice at two and a half *jin* per person per day, and turn over the remainder to the headquarters. If the entire substitute labor wage is turned over, it will still be counted as voluntary labor. Animals: For each animal, in addition to the one *jin* of black beans and three *jin* of grass issued for every 100 *jin* pulled for 50 *li*, all remaining wages are to be turned over to the headquarters (grass and beans are priced according to the current market rate). Work points are calculated the same as for voluntary transportation. The price of substitute labor is kept by the headquarters, and at the time of settlement, it is distributed evenly across all village labor services.
　　3. Temporary tasks: If passing soldiers or sick individuals need to be transported by animals, every 50 *li* traveled for weights under 300 *jin* is equivalent to three work points, including the cart driver's work. For heavier loads, work points are calculated according to the voluntary transportation standard. For human labor, if passing soldiers have luggage weighing between 40 and 60 *jin* that needs to be transported by fully capable laborers, 60 *li* of travel is calculated as one and a half work points. For weights below 40 *jin*, transport by semi-capable laborers for 16 *li* is equivalent to one work point.
　　4. Delivering messages and guiding the way: Daytime guiding and message delivery are handled by semi-capable and auxiliary laborers, with every 16 *li* traveled equivalent to one *xiang*, and 80 *li* equivalent to one work point. Nighttime message delivery and guiding the way are handled by fully capable laborers, with 12 *li* equivalent to one *xiang*.

　　The round trip distance is counted for all of the above tasks. For tasks such as voluntary and substitute transportation, if there is a return load, half a work point is added to the above work point calculation standard.

　　Cadre and militia meetings and training: All cadres and militiamen perform labor service, but attending meetings and training is equivalent to labor service. Attending meetings in the village does not count towards work points. Attending meetings and training in other villages or districts and counties is calculated at one work point per day, counting both travel to and from the location. War participation and transportation are treated the same as the masses.

　　In this way, labor service tickets and work tickets are equivalent. Labor service tickets are issued by the headquarters, and work tickets are issued by the mutual aid groups. The entire village is divided into four sub-districts and four mutual aid teams. Each team is responsible for the captain, instructor, and secretary. The village headquarters uniformly directs the labor and livestock above the team leader, and the mutual aid group is below the team leader. A major accounting is done every month. After labor service is performed, the headquarters issues labor service tickets at any time. At the time of settlement, the work tickets and labor service tickets are first taken to the mutual aid group for calculation, then the group leader goes to the team for calculation, and then the team leader goes to the headquarters for calculation. The labor and livestock of the entire village are uniformly evaluated and assigned. At the time of settlement, semi-, auxiliary-, and fully capable laborers, as well as livestock, are converted into fully capable laborers. Then, the total number of labor services used in a month is summarized. In this way, the average number of labor services per laborer in a month can be obtained. If a certain team, group, or person has performed more labor services, they can offset labor service in the following month, or receive rice, or perform work within the group. The wage for each work point is uniformly calculated at five *jin* of rice. In this way, the masses of the entire village can achieve a great exchange of labor between the front and rear for war participation, support, and labor of people and animals. Those participating in the war can also feel at ease, the land can be cultivated well, and labor waste can also be avoided. The labor force of the entire village can be balanced, the scope of labor service can be expanded, and the phenomenon of random allocation can be avoided. At the same time, the efficiency of labor should be improved and promoted. (Huaibao, Defu, Guoqing)

　　集店村战勤生产变工办法
    【本报壶关讯】一区集店为了克服差务不公，特由全村群众共同研究出：前后方参战支差生产人畜大变工的办法，兹报导如下，供各地参考。农业生产上：死分活计按活折工，每工以五晌计，春耕时人拉犁，每八分顶一工，吃自己饭，牲口犁地每犁一亩顶一工，做犁人的工也在内。地主户不管牲口草料，只管做犁人的饭，地得犁好；其他零星活，都以此为标准来折，超过标准者多顶工，在各个季节的生产上，都由大家讨论出折工标准。参战：民兵参战自卫队抬担架都为参战。各带给养者，在外一工折农业上一工半，公家给养者一工顶一工。支差：１、义运差；人差走三天以内走六十里远担六十斤重，折农业生产一工半，三天以外，六十里远担五十斤顶一工半（因路远了干粮多带）。牲口差每一牲口拉一百斤重走五十里远，折一人工，赶车工也在内。但每一牲口走五十里，拉一百斤重者，由指挥部发黑豆一斤、草三斤，多拉者多发，以此为标准。２、代雇差：人差每人一天以走六十里担六十斤为一工，在代雇的工资内扣除吃米每人每天二斤半，余数交指挥部，如把代雇工资全部交者，仍如义务差计工。牲口：每一牲口除了每一百斤重五十里地发一斤黑豆三斤草外，其余工资一律交指挥部（草与豆按当时价格定），计工和义运差同。代雇的价格由指挥部保存，到算账时按全村差役平均分配。３、临时差；有过路彩病号，得由牲口运送者，三百以下，每走五十里地折三工，赶车在内，多者按义运差计工。人差，如过路军人有四十至六十斤重的行李，得由全劳力运送者，走六十里地以一工半计算；四十斤以下者半劳力运送走十六里地折一工。４、送信引路差：白天引路送信都由半劳力与辅劳力等，每走十六里地折为一晌，八十里为一工，黑夜送信带路得由全劳力十二里为一晌。以上各种差役来回里数都算，如义运代雇等差，来时仍有回差者，按以上计工标准多计半工。干部民兵开会整训：干部民兵一律支差，但开会整训一律顶差，在村开会一律不计工，在外村与县区开会整训者，一天计一工，以走时与来时计算，参战运输者与群众同。这样差票和工票相等，差票由指挥部制发，工票由互助组制发，全村共分四小区，四个互助队，每队由队长指导员书记三人负责，队长上边全村指挥部统一调动劳畜力，队长下面由互助组，每一月一大算账，支差后由指挥部随时发给差票，算账时拿上工票与差票先到互助组算，由组长再到队算，然后由队长到指挥部算。把全村劳畜力统一评议定分，算账时把半、辅助、全劳力、畜力都折为全劳力，然后把一月内共用差数总结，这样即可得出每一劳力一月内平均的差数。如某队组或人支差多了，可在下月内顶差，也可得米，或在组内顶工。少了出米或下一月多支，及在组内做工。每一工工资米一律以五斤计算。这样，全村群众即可做到前后方参战支差人畜力大变工，参战的人也能安心，地也能做好，也可避免浪费劳力。全村劳力既能做到平衡，又能扩大支差面，和避免乱派的现象，同时也能提高与发扬其劳力应有的效率。（怀保、德富、国庆）
