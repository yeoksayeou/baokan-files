    Chongyi Forms Production Turn-Over Mutual Aid Teams
    Most of 5,000 Mu of Land Plowed
    [This Dispatch from Wu'an] In early February, the production leadership organization of Chongyi Village was established. The deputy director of the village's Turn-Over General Association concurrently serves as the director of production, and the directors of the five street Turn-Over sub-associations concurrently serve as street production directors and street team leaders. With the mobilization of spring plowing production, the masses also spontaneously formed 72 production turn-over mutual aid groups, totaling 474 full and semi-laborers and 146 livestock. Currently, most of the village's more than 5,000 mu of stubble land has been plowed, and it can all be completed before sowing. The turn-over movement, under unified planning leadership, also adopted a combination method of production teams buzzing during the day and concentrated meetings at night to solve problems. In terms of meeting methods, it was proposed that meetings should have a focus, thinking should be prepared, meeting times should be short, and problem-solving should be fast. The whole village has 519 households, with more than 7,200 mu of land. Excluding soldiers, transferred cadres, and cooperative members who have left production, there are actually 388 full laborers, with an average of more than 18 mu of land per person; each draft animal averages 93.5 mu of cultivated land; in addition, there are 50 military families and 121 elderly, weak, and widowed people, totaling 172 households that need help or substitute farming. In order to smoothly complete the spring plowing, the masses, after discussion, determined the following labor and livestock adjustment methods: (1) According to the amount of land cultivated by the village's labor and livestock, propose standards, voluntary combination, livestock are based on two draft animals per 100 mu of land, labor is adjusted temporarily according to the actual situation, but not forced or emphasized averaging. (2) According to the needs of land seasonal crops, labor and livestock are comprehensively taken care of. Spring planting of cotton is urgent, so everyone first plows the cotton fields from house to house, and the grain fields will be planted later if they are not immediately needed, which solves the contradiction of uneven priority and advances life according to the season. (3) Cultivation first prioritizes military families, and women use textile labor exchange, stipulating that spinning two jin of cotton is equivalent to three men's workdays, recording work and settling accounts at any time. Those who cannot immediately repay the labor temporarily record the work, and organize labor repayment during weeding and hoeing. The elderly, weak, and widowed are also combined in each group. Production and combat participation have a unified wage standard, and the front and rear are unified labor exchange: the spring artificial labor is five jin of rice per day, temporarily increased during busy times, combat participation is equivalent to labor, and accounts are settled uniformly within the group after returning. The organizational form adopts joint groups and cooperation groups. Combat participation in production is under unified leadership. Two draft animals are set up with one cooperation group leader, and four draft animals are set up with one joint group leader, cooperating with the production directors of each street to uniformly plan combat participation in production and the mutual adjustment of labor and livestock. Usually, each group plans its own activities, and when participating in combat or during busy times, they cooperate with each other to adjust the balance. (Han Huan)

    崇义组成生产翻身互助组
    五千亩地大部犁完
    【本报武安讯】二月初，崇义全村的生产领导组织就建立起来，全村翻身总会副主任担任生产总主任，五个街的翻身分会主任兼任生产街主任和街队长，随着春耕生产的动员，群众亦自动结合成立了七十二个生产翻身互助小组，计全半劳力四百七十四个，牲口一百四十六头，现全村五千多亩茬地已大部垡完，下种前可全部完成。翻身运动在统一计划领导下，亦采取了白天生产小组圪嚷，黑夜集中开会解决问题的结合办法，在开会方法上并提出了开会要有中心，思想要有准备，开会时间要短，解决问题要快。全村五一九户，土地七千二百多亩，除去参军、调走干部、合作社脱离生产人员，实有全劳力三百八十八个，一人平均种地十八亩多；每犋牲口平均耕地九十三亩五分；另外有军属五十户，孤寡老弱一百廿一户，共一百七十二户须要帮助或代耕。为顺利完成春耕，群众经讨论后定出如下劳力畜力调剂方法：（一）按照全村劳畜力负担耕作土地数量，提出标准，自愿结合，牲口按两个一犋种地一百亩，劳力则按实际情况，临时调剂，但不强制亦不强调平均。（二）按照土地季节庄稼需要，劳畜力全面照顾，春天种棉花要紧，大家就先挨户犁花地，谷地马上不种就靠后一点，解决了先后不均的矛盾，并按照季节赶早了生活。（三）耕种先尽军属，妇女用纺织变工，规定纺二斤花顶三个男人工，随时记工结账。马上还不了工的暂时记工，锄苗拔草时组织还工，孤寡老弱也都结合在各小组。生产参战统一工资标准，前后方统一变工：春季人工每天五斤米，忙时临时增加，参战顶工，回来组内统一算账，组织形式上采取联合组、配合组，参战生产统一领导，两犋牲口设配合组长一人，四犋牲口设联合组长一人，配合各街生产主任，统一计划参战生产以及劳畜力的相互调剂，平时各组自行计划活动，参战或活紧时，则互相配合，调剂平衡。（韩寰）
