The Taihang Fourth Military Sub-district Launches Mass Guerrilla Warfare
    Breakthrough Achieved South of the Daoqing Railway
    District Committee Instructs Bold and Unrestrained Expansion of Local Work
    [This newspaper Taihang News] After the Fourth District Committee meeting, each county conducted transmission and in-depth discussions among all county cadres, greatly enhancing the cadres' determination and confidence in persisting in the struggle south of the Daoqing Railway. Subsequently, at the end of February, each county went deep into the area south of the railway, and after more than twenty days of fighting against "encirclements" and "mopping-up operations," the enemy's small units could not or dared not easily penetrate deeply into the area of more than ten li north and south and thirty li east and west along the Qin River. The masses' fear and disbelief that we could hold out have been transformed; they are actively helping our army and the armed work teams, delivering intelligence, and standing guard. During the anti-"mopping-up" struggle on March 11th, the Wuzhi Fifth and Sixth District armed work teams were sheltered for a day by more than 30 people in a village near Xiaogao. The masses automatically set up sentries to monitor the enemy, planning to report immediately if the enemy came to their village. When the Wuzhi Fourth District armed work team was pushed near Wugeyan by the enemy, the masses sent intelligence one after another, enabling them to safely transfer to the south bank of the Qin River. The Fourth District Political Commissar, Comrades Lu Zhengmin and Bai Yuhu, said with great confidence: "We are determined not to go to the mountains. We have found relationships, three or five at a time. If it becomes more serious, we will disperse, making it impossible for the enemy to find and eliminate us." Thus, on the night of the 11th, they transferred from the south bank of the Qin River back to the north bank. Every time our troops arrived at a village, all the men, women, old, and young welcomed and sent them off. They said very cordially, "Come and stay in our village again!" Old Man Xitao recounted his old and new hatreds in a very painful way, expressing to us: "I will not leave. Come and find me at this home again!" The family member of a militiaman in ×× Gully told his son to work hard. Old Man Xu Bao××× of Qinyang said, "We will definitely starve them (Chiang's army) to death in the city!"
    Based on this situation, Comrade Gao of the District Committee instructed the counties south of the railway to boldly and unrestrainedly carry out local work in conjunction with military guerrilla activities. He pointed out that the current situation is different from that of the opening up of the area south of the railway in 1943, criticized some comrades' "stage theory" of needing a period of military activity, and instructed specific methods for carrying out local work. Now, three base points have been established in the Fourth District of Bo'ai, and a joint meeting of "face-to-face people" (village leaders) in the entire district has been held. Three base points have been established in the Fourth District of Wuzhi, and Wen County convened a joint meeting of sixty "face-to-face people" from thirty-two villages, arranged the work, and is now actively carrying out local work.

　　太行四分区开展群众游击战
    道清路南打开局面
    地委指示大胆放手开展地方工作
    【本报太行讯】四地委会议后，各县都在全县干部中进行了传达和深入的讨论，干部中对坚持道清路南斗争的决心和信心是大大的提高了。各县随于二月底先后深入路南，经过二十多天的反“合击”反“清剿”斗争，沁河两岸南北十余里东西三十余里的地区，敌人小股已经不能或不敢轻易的深进。群众的恐惧和不相信我们能坚持住的，已有转变，积极的帮助我军及武工队，送递情报、站岗放哨。武陟五、六区武工队在三月十一号的反“清剿”斗争中，在小高附近某村三十余人荫蔽一天，群众自动的就放起哨来，监视敌人，他们打算如果敌人向他村来，就马上报告。武陟四区武工队，被敌人压到武阁岩附近时，群众就纷纷送来情报，使他们能安然转移到沁河南岸。四区政委路正民和白玉虎二同志，即很有信心的说：“我们决心不上山啦，我们已三个五个的找好了关系，如果再严重，我们即分散，使敌人无法找到，消灭我们是万不能的。”于是他们在十一号夜间，又从沁河南岸，转到北岸来。我们队伍每到一村，全村男女老少都在欢迎欢送。很亲切的说出：“再过来住我们村！”西桃老汉很沉痛的诉说完他的旧恨新仇，对我们表示说：“我不走，你们再来到这家里找我吧”！××沟某民兵家属嘱咐他儿子，要好好干。沁阳许宝×××老汉说：“一定能把他们（蒋军）饿死在城里！”
    根据这样的情况，地委高同志指示路南各县，要结合军事游击活动，大胆放手的，迅速开展地方工作。指出现在和四三年开辟路南时的情况不同，批判了某些同志的要有一个时期军事活动的“阶段论”思想，并且指示了开展地方工作的具体作法。现在博爱四区建立了三个基点，开了全区“照脸人”（村里负责人）联席会，武陟四区已成立了三个基点，温县召开了三十二个村六十余“照脸人”联席会，布置了工作，现在正积极的开展地方工作。（陈平）
