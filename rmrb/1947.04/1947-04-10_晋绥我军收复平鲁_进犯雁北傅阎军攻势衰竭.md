Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, April 4th (Delayed dispatch): The Jin-Sui People's Liberation Army launched a counterattack on March 31st against the Fu Zuoyi army, led by Guo Changqing and others, which had occupied Pinglu. The Fu army fled in disarray, and Pinglu County was recovered.

Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, April 7th: The Fu-Yan army, which invaded the Yanbei area, is still entrenched in the three empty cities of Zuoyun, Youyu, and Huairen,不敢轻进(daring not to advance rashly) after the People's Liberation Army in the area recovered Pinglu at the end of last month. This time, in order to "coordinate" with Hu Zongnan's attack on northern Shaanxi, Fu hastily transferred troops guarding Zhangjiakou and fighting in Hebei to Datong and the western section of the Ping-Sui Railway. On March 22nd, under the command of Lu Yinglin, commander of Fu's 35th Army, with more than 30,000 troops in 15 regiments, they began to invade the Yanbei liberated area west of the Tongpu Railway from the east, west, and north. Although they had infantry and cavalry coordination and air force cover, they were always timid and afraid of being annihilated. When attacking Zuoyun, they divided their forces into several routes, each route watching the other. The 120 miles from Datong to Zuoyun took four days. Five days after the start of the battle, their so-called offensive had already declined. On the 27th, the People's Liberation Army in the area began a counterattack, killing and capturing more than 60 Fu stubborn county heads and major regimental adjutants at Huangtupo. And recovered Pinglu. The rear of the Fu-Yan army, which ventured into Yanbei, is empty. Under the attack of the people's guerrilla warfare and the main force of the People's Liberation Army in the area, they will surely suffer defeat.

Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, April 8th: Since the Fu army's southward invasion, the Yanbei Liberated Army has been accepting Fu army deserters every day. The elite 101st Division of the Fu army, which attacked Zuoyun this time, had almost all its old soldiers killed or wounded in the Jining campaign last autumn. Most of them were newly conscripted soldiers, and desertion was even more serious. The People's Liberation Army had already accepted more than 400 deserters from the division. Wang Chengxi, a soldier who escaped from the communications company of the New 2nd Brigade, which attacked from Fengzhen, said that the brigade did not allow soldiers to leave the city after occupying Zuoyun, but desertion still occurred constantly. The company had more than 170 people last year, but now there are only more than 50 people left. When the 101st Training Division of the Fu army, which attacked from Liangcheng, occupied the Shahu Pass, the guard squad on duty escaped with all their guns.

Xinhua News Agency, Lüliang, April 7th: The Wenshui Guerrilla and more than 1,000 militiamen once recovered Shiai Town, 30 miles east of the city, in mid-March, and completely destroyed all the blockhouse fortifications. On the 21st, the team again attacked the Yan army who were harassing and looting grain in Xicheng Village, 20 miles west of the city, killing and capturing a total of more than 50 people, and seizing one small cannon, three machine guns, and 27 rifles.
