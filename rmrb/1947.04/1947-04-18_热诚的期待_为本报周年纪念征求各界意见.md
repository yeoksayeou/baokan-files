　　Earnest Expectations
    Soliciting Opinions from All Sectors for the Newspaper's Anniversary
    The upcoming first anniversary of our newspaper's founding – May 15th – should be a time for the newspaper itself to review past work, summarize experiences, and strive for improvement and enhancement, so that the newspaper can further connect with the masses and with reality, and play a greater role in the cause of serving the people. To ensure that this review and summary is done well and truly becomes the foundation for future improvement, we earnestly expect all Party, government, military, and civilian comrades, cultural work comrades, elementary school teacher comrades, newspaper correspondent comrades, and the vast readers who care for this newspaper to enthusiastically offer your hopes and constructive opinions for the newspaper. Please provide specific details about which aspects of the newspaper in the past were good and should be improved upon, and which had shortcomings and should be improved. Individual or collective submissions are welcome; the format is not restricted, and you can use letters or articles. To ensure a wide collection of opinions, we especially hope that our newspaper correspondent comrades can collect opinions from others on our behalf. If conditions permit, try to convene small-scale informal discussion meetings to collect more opinions. We will open a special column to disclose them successively and plan to publish a special issue on the anniversary; we will also improve the newspaper and our work based on these opinions.
    Please send letters and manuscripts directly to the Newspaper's Communication and Liaison Section.
            The Newspaper Editorial Board
