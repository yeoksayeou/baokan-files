[This dispatch from our Taiyue office on the 20th] The Liu Jinrong Mutual Aid Brigade in Dongjiashan Village, Shi Min District, has entered into large-scale production. All men and women, full and semi-labor force in the village have been organized into twelve groups according to natural villages, totaling ninety full laborers and forty semi-laborers. The mutual aid groups fully implement a work-point system. Preferential treatment for military families, support for public service, participation in the war effort, and production are all unified under the work-point system. There are sixteen military families in the village. Besides those who can cultivate their own land, there are 120 mu of land that need to be cultivated on their behalf. According to the calculation that one mu of flat land requires five work-points from plowing and planting to harvesting, and mountain land requires four work-points, a total of 510 work-points of labor and 60 work-points of cattle labor are needed. Based on this calculation, the work-points due to each military family are uniformly issued. Whenever military families need labor or animal power, they can ask the mutual aid group for help. After the cultivation is done, the preferential work-points are given to those who did the cultivation.

The village has established a precise equivalent exchange method, which facilitates more semi-laborers to participate in mutual aid. Guo Dianku of the Erlv mutual aid group is a cripple and cannot carry loads, but he is very good at gathering firewood. Therefore, he participates in the mutual aid group and specializes in gathering firewood. Every 100 jin of firewood is equivalent to one load of manure. Women like Guo Wenhua of Balv, cannot carry manure, so they specialize in spinning cotton for others. Every five liang of spun cotton or one zhang of woven cloth also counts as one work-point. As a result, more people are participating in the mutual aid group. Everyone says: "Participating in the mutual aid group means we can do everything, everything is convenient, and no problem is difficult to solve." In order to take care of women's physical strength and physiological conditions, it is also stipulated that women should carry manure to nearby, flat land. Eight women in Dahetan have sent out 1,750 loads of manure. Thirty-five women in the Fourth and Fifth lv are all organized. They propose that they will not rely on men, and will send all 14,000 loads of manure to the fields, and also spin 30 jin of thread and weave five bolts of cloth. They say: "In the past, it was men who farmed and women who weaved, now it must be women who farm and weave, and men who participate in the war."

    【本报太岳二十日电】士敏董家山村刘金荣互助大队，已进入大生产。全村男女全半劳力都组织起来，按自然庄组织了十二个小组，共计全劳力九十个，半劳力四十个。互助组内完全实行工票制，优军、支差、参战、生产都实行统一的工票，全村军属十六户，除自己能耕种者，还有需要代耕地一百二十亩，按一亩平地从犁种到收割需五个工，山地需四个工计，共需人工五百一十个，牛工六十个。根据这个计算，把每个军属应得的工票统一发给，军属什么时候需要人工或畜力，随时可向互助组提出代耕，代耕后就将优待的工票给了代耕的人。该村订出精确的等价交换办法，便利了更多的半劳力参加互助，二闾互助组郭殿库，是个跛子，不能担挑，拾柴却很在行，因之，他参加互助组，就专门拾柴，每拾一百斤顶一个担粪工。八闾妇女郭文花等，不能担粪，专门给人纺花，每纺五两花或织一丈布，也算一个工，因此参加互助组的人就多起来。大家都说：“参加互助组什么都能干，什么都方便，有什么问题都不难解决。”为照顾妇女的体力和生理的关系，又定出了女人担粪往近地、平地担。大河滩八个妇女，已送出粪一千七百五十担。四、五两闾三十五个妇女全部组织起来，她们提出不靠男人，把一万四千担粪都送到地里，还要纺三十斤线，织五匹布，她们说：“过去是男耕女织，现在要女耕女织，男人参战。”
