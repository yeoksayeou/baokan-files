Xinhua News Agency, Tongpu Front, 17th. "Hu Zongnan is already trapped in the mire of Yan'an. It's either death in battle or capture, or dismissal!" This was the concluding remark of Major General Wang Shuchen, Deputy Brigade Commander of the 27th Brigade of the 30th Division of the KMT army, captured in the Houma battle, when talking to reporters about his views on the situation in northern Shaanxi. Wang frequently followed Hu Zongnan in attacking southern Shanxi and other places and was familiar with the internal situation of the Hu army. He affirmed, "Hu Zongnan's army's attack on Yan'an, as the Yan'an headquarters spokesperson said, is a manifestation of the inability to overcome the military crisis. Jiang and Hu attempted to boost morale by attacking Yan'an, which left other places empty. This time, I traveled from Xuchang to Tongguan, passing through the Pinghan and Longhai Railways. Except for the headquarters of the 38th Division in Luoyang and a battalion of the 3rd Engineer Regiment in Tongguan, there were no other regular troops defending." Wang frowned and said, "Hu Zongnan is trapped in a mire. He can get into Yan'an, but he can't get out. Because Chiang Kai-shek cannot abandon Yan'an, which would immediately cause the collapse of Chiang Kai-shek's rule. This determines that Hu Zongnan will either be dismissed due to the failure of the war, or be killed in Yan'an, or become a prisoner." Wang's tone suddenly changed, and he said, "However, no matter how Chiang Kai-shek and Hu Zongnan fail, they always publicize victories. Isn't the Central News Agency publicizing the rout of the Eighth Route Army these days? Just like last year when the 81st Regiment of the 27th Brigade attacked Wangjiahe, Xia County, in late August, they killed five or six civilians, the regiment reported to the brigade that they had killed 100 enemies, and the brigade reported to the division that they had killed more than 250 people, and they found some broken guns and reported that they had captured more than 300 guns. And because of this, they got a 300,000 yuan bonus." Wang suddenly laughed and said, "No one believes these fabricated victory messages anymore!"

    被俘蒋军副旅长说：
    胡宗南已陷延安泥坑
    不战死被俘就会撤职
    【新华社同蒲前线十七日电】“胡宗南已陷在延安的泥坑里。不是战死被俘，便是被撤职！”这是侯马战斗中被俘的蒋军三十师二十七旅副旅长王书忱少将对记者谈陕北战局观感的结语。王屡随胡宗南进攻晋南等地，熟习胡军内情，他肯定的说：“胡宗南军进攻延安，确如延安总部发言人所说，是军事危机无法克服的表现。蒋胡图以进攻延安，提高士气，其他地方即呈空虚。这次本人从许昌至潼关，途经平汉、陇海两路，除洛阳有一个三十八师师部，潼关有工兵第三团的一个营外，均无其他正规部队防守。”王氏蹙着眉头说：“胡宗南陷入了泥坑，他进得去延安，却出不得延安。因为蒋介石不能放弃延安，那样会立刻引起蒋介石统治的崩溃。这就确定了胡宗南不是因战争失利撤职，便是打死在延安，或者当俘虏。”王的语气突然一转，说：“不过，蒋介石、胡宗南不论怎样失败，总是宣传胜利的。这几天中央社不是在宣传八路军溃窜吗？正如去年二十七旅八十一团八月下旬进攻夏县王家河时，打死了五六个老百姓，团向旅报告毙敌一百，旅向师报告为二百五十余人，又找到几支烂枪，报告缴获三百余支。并因此得了三十万元奖金。”王氏忽然大笑起来，他说：“这些捏造的胜利消息，再也没人相信了！”
