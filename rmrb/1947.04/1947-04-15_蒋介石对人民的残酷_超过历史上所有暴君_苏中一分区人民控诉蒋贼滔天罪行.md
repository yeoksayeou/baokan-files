Xinhua News Agency, Central China, April 11th: The Lin Provisional Assembly, the joint federations of workers, peasants, youth, and women, and cultural organizations of the First District of Central Jiangsu in the Suwan Border Region, have issued a "Bill of Indictment by Three Million People," accusing Chiang Kai-shek of heinous crimes against the people of the area. The document begins by stating: "Since September of last year, Chiang Kai-shek, in the 'encirclement and suppression' of the four counties of Taizhou, Taixing, Rugao, and Jingjiang south of the Hai'an-Taizhou line, has massacred over 7,000 people, raped over 20,000 women, burned down over 30,000 houses, and plundered countless properties. The areas with the most brutal killings include Huangqiao in Taixing, where over 400 farmers were buried alive in twenty-one nights; Jiagang in Jingjiang, where over 500 young people were collectively slaughtered; the Coral District in Rugao, where over 360 people were shot in one day; the Xin Street District in Taixing, where over 300 people were collectively strangled; and the Houhe District in Jingjiang, where over 200 people were killed in one instance. Wherever the Chiang troops went, the cries of grief shook the heavens. Even three-year-old children were labeled 'bandit seeds' and cruelly murdered without exception. In Jingjiang, Taihe, Dongxing, and other districts, there are virtually no young people left. Victims were buried by their elderly parents, who bore the corpses themselves, as no one else would carry the coffins. Such a scene is unbearable to describe! The farmers' way of life has been completely destroyed by the Chiang bandits. Every day, at the break of dawn, they carry their clothes and children, 'waiting for the situation'; as soon as the sun rises, they 'slip away'; and at sunset, they have to 'check the situation.' Passing tonight, they do not know what tomorrow will bring. They dare not live in their houses, dare not cook their meals, dare not walk on the roads. Their misery is a hundred times more cruel than the Japanese devils' treatment of the Chinese people." The document continues: "We clearly tell the Chiang bandits: Three million people have the strength to defeat the Japanese devils, and even more strength to defeat Chiang Kai-shek, who has replaced Wang Jingwei." The document concludes with an appeal to the people of the nation: "All righteous people must fully recognize that Chiang Kai-shek's cruelty to the Chinese people has exceeded that of all tyrants in history. The Chinese people must use their full strength to support the patriotic self-defense war, oppose Chiang Kai-shek's tyranny, wipe the fascist bloodstains from the land of China, and rebuild an independent, prosperous, and happy New China!"

Xinhua News Agency, Central China, April 11th: When the Chiang troops "encircled and suppressed" western Jingjiang in Central Jiangsu, they carried out massacres in the Dongxing and Taihe districts. In Jiagang alone, over 500 young men were killed. During the "encirclement and suppression," the 306th Regiment of the 102nd Brigade of the Chiang army set out from Sheng祠堂 in three routes, searching house by house. Anyone found hiding was dragged out and killed, and machine guns were used to fire on large groups of "running away" masses, forcing thousands of people to flee westward. On the border line between the west and Taixing, Chiang troops sealed off the line, leaving no way to go. Finally, they were surrounded on the Jiagang beach along the river. Knowing that they were in a desperate situation, the cries of grief shook the heavens and could be heard from ten miles away. Brave men, unwilling to be captured by the Chiang troops, threw themselves into the river to commit suicide. Except for five hundred youths were arrested by Chiang’s army. In the ten-mile journey from Jiagang to Bilu City, over forty people were killed. In a wheat field in Longgangwei, the corpses almost completely covered the wheat. Arriving at the Sixteen Wei near Bilu City, the Chiang troops again arrested the surrounding people and locked them in a large house. During the day, they were severely tortured, and at night, they were stripped naked and laid on the ground, with the Chiang troops pouring cold water on them every few minutes. After two days and nights, most of them had frozen to death, and those who did not die were shot. After the tragedy, corpses were scattered everywhere in the two districts, with new graves everywhere. Children wore white hats, and women cried with hoarse voices. In each village, nine out of ten houses were empty, with hardly any people. To avenge this great hatred, the masses actively joined the Jingjiang Independent Regiment and personally sent their children to join the army. Old people said to the regiment commander: "We don't want to see our sons killed by the Chiang bandits, so we send them here to fight the Chiang bandits!"

　　蒋介石对人民的残酷
    超过历史上所有暴君
    苏中一分区人民控诉蒋贼滔天罪行
    【新华社华中十一日电】苏皖边区苏中一分区临参会，工、农、青、妇各联合会及文化团体等顷发表“三百万人民的控诉书”，向全国人民控诉蒋贼戮害该地人民的滔天罪行。该文首称：“蒋介石自去年九月迄今半年来，在海（安）泰（州）线以南之泰州、泰兴、如皋、靖江四县“清剿”中所残杀的人民已达七千余名，强奸妇女在两万以上，烧毁民房三万余间，抢劫财产则难数计。其杀戮最惨之地区，如泰兴黄桥，二十一夜即活埋农民四百余；靖江夹港口集体屠杀五百余青年；如皋珊瑚区一天枪杀三百六十余人；泰兴新街区集体勒死三百余人；靖江侯河区一次杀死二百余人。蒋军所到之处，哭声震天，连三岁小孩亦被称为“匪种”，一律虐杀勿论。靖江、太和、东兴等区甚至已无青年踪迹，被害者无人抬棺，老父老母亲目负尸埋葬。此情此景，曷忍卒述！农民生活习惯，已被蒋贼破坏无遗。每日东方发白，背起衣包小孩“等情况”；太阳一出，“溜情况”；日落时、又要“查情况”。渡过今宵，未卜明日。有屋不敢住，有饭不敢烧，有路不敢走，悲惨之状，比之日寇对待中国人民犹残酷百倍。”该文继称：“我们明告蒋贼：三百万人民有力量击溃日寇，更有力量击溃代替汪精卫的蒋介石。”该文最后向全国人民呼吁：“一切正义的人士必须充分认清蒋介石对中国人民的残酷已超过历史上所有的暴君，中国人民必须用全面力量支援爱国自卫战争，反对蒋介石的暴政，将法西斯的血迹从中国的土地上揩去，重建独立、繁荣、幸福的新中国！”
    【新华社华中十一日电】蒋军“清剿”苏中靖（江）西时，曾在东兴、太和两区进行屠杀，仅夹港口一次被杀青壮年即达五百余人。“清剿”中蒋军一○二旅三○六团从生祠堂分三路出发，沿途挨户搜索，凡躲藏者推出即杀，并用机枪扫射大群“跑反”群众，迫使数千群众奔向西去。西部通泰兴的界河线上，又有蒋军封锁，再无路可走，终被包围于沿江之夹港口沙滩上。大家自知已临绝境，一时哭声震天，十数里外可闻。硬汉不愿为蒋军俘去，纷纷投江自尽；除五百青年遂为蒋军押走。自夹港口至毗芦市十几里路途中。即被杀四十余人。龙港圩一块麦田里，死尸几乎将麦子完全盖住，行至毗芦市附近之十六圩，蒋军复将周围人民抓捕一起关在大屋中，白天严刑拷打，晚上剥光衣服，连卧于地上，蒋军并每隔几分钟来浇冷水一次。如此两昼夜，大部均已冻毙，不死者亦被枪毙。惨案发生后，该两区尸暴遍野，新坟累累，小孩都戴白帽，女人哀哭声嘶。各村十室十空，几无人烟，为报此大仇，群众纷纷参加靖江独立团，亲送子弟参军。老人们向团长说：“我们不愿看自己的儿子被蒋贼杀死，送到这里和蒋贼拚命！”
