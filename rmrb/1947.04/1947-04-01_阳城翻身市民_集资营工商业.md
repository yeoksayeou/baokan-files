　　Yangcheng Liberated Citizens
    Raise Funds to Run Industry and Commerce
    [This newspaper's Taiyue 30th dispatch] In Yangcheng, during the land redistribution movement, private industry and commerce have developed from over 200 businesses to 340, due to the correct implementation of industrial and commercial policies. Over a thousand households of urban poor people and families of soldiers have received their share of the fruits and invested them in industrial and commercial production to make a fortune. The liberated masses, including Wang Xiaogong, and over a hundred others, raised 3.7 million to establish an industrial and commercial joint cooperative. This cooperative includes businesses such as tobacco, oil presses, and grocery stores. After being reformed, Guo Hengyuan's private business developed to over 700,000, and the masses also elected him as the vice director of the Chengguan Chamber of Commerce. The Tongxinhe Cooperative in Shizi Street is composed of over 20 liberated households. They invested the fruits they received in the mass movement as shares, and the members greatly developed their skills. Wang Xiaotie and Li Jindan knew how to cook, so they opened a restaurant. Song Lintu knew how to steam buns, so he sold steamed buns. Li Jinwang and others understood the trade of iron goods, cloth, and other groceries, so they sold groceries. Wang Haiwang knew how to grind flour, so he opened a mill. Everyone worked together with one heart, and now it has developed into a cooperative with capital of over one million. Li Xiaozhou and Li Jixian, two brothers, were originally small vendors. They were allocated four city houses and fruits with a capital of over 20,000, and now they have developed into a grocery store with over 100,000. Both brothers got married. Under the call to defend Chairman Mao and defend the liberation, Li Xiaozhou volunteered to join the army. Among the thirty-odd retired soldiers in the city, eleven have married after liberation. Due to the development of private capital, goods such as cloth, cotton, and salt have poured in in large quantities, and the market has greatly prospered.

　　阳城翻身市民
    集资营工商业
    【本报太岳卅日电】阳城在填平补齐运动中，由于正确执行了工商业政策，私营工商业已由二百余家发展到三百四十家。城市贫民军干家属千余户均分得果实，投入工商业生产发家。翻身群众王小贡等百余人，集资三百七十万举办了工商联合互助社，该社包括烟、油坊、杂货店等业务。郭恒元得到改造后，私人商业发展至七十多万，群众还选举他为城关商会的副主任。十字街的同心合互助社是廿余户翻身群众组成的，他们把在群运中分得的果实入了股，社员大大发挥了一技之长。王小铁、李金旦会做饭，就开了饭铺，宋林土会蒸馍就卖蒸馍，李锦旺等懂得铁货、布匹等杂货买卖，就卖杂货。王海旺会磨面就开了磨坊，大家齐心合作，如今已发展成拥有资本一百多万元的互助社。李小周、李继先弟兄俩原来是个小贩，分得市房四间，资本二万余元的果实，至今已发展成拥有十余万元的杂货铺，弟兄俩都娶了妻，李小周在保卫毛主席保卫翻身的号召下，自报奋勇地参了军。全城三十多个荣退军人，翻身后已有了十一个娶了妻。由于私人资本获得发展，布匹、棉花、食盐等货物，大批的拥入，市场大大繁荣。
