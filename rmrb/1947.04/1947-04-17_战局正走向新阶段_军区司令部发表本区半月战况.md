The powerful offensive of the People's Liberation Army of Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu, which was first launched in northern Henan at the end of March, has subsequently unfolded universally on all fronts, actively attacking the Chiang army from all directions.

For twenty days, after eliminating the stubborn puppet forces around Xinxiang and Ji County in northern Henan, our army marched north, captured Qi County, and successively cleared the periphery of Anyang and Tangyin, including strongholds such as Hebi, Caiyuan, Yigou, Pangzhuang, Xiaotun, Taibao, Chuwang, Huilong, Liuyuan, Guantai, Shuiye, Fengle, and Honghetun. It thoroughly destroyed the railway between Anyang, Tangyin, Qi, and Ji, as well as the Guantai and Anyang branch lines, and eliminated the local bandits in northern Henan, including the forces of Cheng Daosheng, Si Huasheng, Liu Lexian, and Hu Quanlu. This cut the protruding wedge-shaped position of the Chiang army between Anyang and Xinxiang into two segments. Furthermore, a powerful unit marched south through Daoqing and recovered Wen County. Although Wang Zhonglian personally led five brigades to northern Anyang and Tangyin on April 5th, he was deterred by the power of the People's Liberation Army and has remained on the line of Qi County and its east, hesitating to advance. Since our army began its offensive on the Tongpu Railway on April 5th, it has swept away the Chiang puppet forces west of the Fen River with the force of a gale sweeping away fallen leaves. In nine days, it captured eight cities in a row (including Fushan, Yicheng, Jiang County, Xinjiang, Hejin, Jishan, Wanquan, and Ronghe), cut off the southern section of the Tongpu Railway, controlled the important gateway between Shanxi and Shaanxi, Yumenkou, and raided the Yuncheng airport, destroying three aircraft. It entered the fertile river delta, the cradle of the Chinese nation. Wherever the army went, it committed no offenses against the people. The people, who had long suffered under the Chiang army's tyranny, welcomed them on both sides of the road, calling them "heavenly soldiers."

Meanwhile, our army in the rear of the enemy in Yu-Wan-Su, after crushing the Chiang army's sixteen-regiment encirclement and suppression, took the initiative to attack, effectively coordinating with the main force on the front lines. In half a month, it successively captured four cities: Taikang, Tongxu, Ningling, and Fugou, as well as the important town of Zhoujiakou, crossed the new Yellow River, and directly threatened the southern section of the Ping-Han Railway. Chiang Kai-shek's original attempt to use the Yellow River to block the mouth in the north failed to restrict our army's maneuverability. Now a gap has been opened in the south, our army's maneuverability is even greater, and Chiang Kai-shek's conspiracy is nothing but a costly, self-deceiving, and foolish act.

Our northern army, in coordination with the fraternal forces of Jin-Cha-Ji, cut off the Zheng-Tai Railway and recovered the strongholds on the periphery of Shijiazhuang and Yuanshi.

In total, since the offensive began, the Ping-Han, Dao-Qing, Zheng-Tai, and Tong-Pu lines have been fragmented. Our army has recovered and newly liberated twenty-one county towns, and killed or captured nearly 20,000 Chiang soldiers. The situation on all fronts has changed.

In the twenty days of combat, the local bandits who had entrenched themselves in northern Henan for more than a decade, including Cheng Daosheng, Hu Quanlu, Si Huasheng, Zhang Mingqing, and Liu Lexian, were either completely annihilated by us or suffered severe blows. In southern Shanxi, our army eliminated all the local stubborn elements in the newly recovered towns. These local stubborn bandits had relied on the Japanese invaders during the Anti-Japanese War, serving as puppet troops. After Japan's surrender, they transformed themselves into Chiang Kai-shek's loyal pawns, assisting the tyrant and harming the people. Their crimes were notorious, and the people hated them to the bone. This time, wherever our mighty army pointed, they collapsed like earth, removing a great scourge for the people and clearing an important obstacle to the development of our liberated areas.

The April offensive also proved that our army has ample strength to recover all lost territories. Since the self-defense war of July last year, our army has, due to the need to annihilate the enemy's active forces, after forcing the enemy to pay a heavy price, voluntarily abandoned some cities, and has repeatedly stated that once the enemy's active forces have suffered a considerable amount of annihilation, these cities will surely return to our hands. In the past twenty days, many towns have been recovered with minimal casualties and in a very short time; other towns have been recovered without firing a shot. Now our operational guiding principle is increasingly familiar to the broad masses of the people, and we call it the policy of "gaining both land and people." Even some cities deep in the rear of the Chiang army, due to the widespread development of guerrilla warfare and the active and proactive operations of our army behind enemy lines, the situation has undergone a historic change. A large number of cities have become guerrilla cities, characterized by mutual contention, with several advances and retreats. For example, Taikang has been recovered by us for the sixth time, Wen County has been recovered by us for the fourth time, and Yicheng, Tongxu, and Qi County have been recovered by us for the third time. The same goes for other places such as Jiaxiang and Chengwu. This shows that the Chiang army lacks troops, its front lines are vast, and even its rear points and lines cannot be guaranteed. This is a sign that the situation behind enemy lines is moving towards a new stage.

The arrival of victorious April shows that the war is moving towards a new stage with rapid changes. (April 1st to 15th)

### 战局正走向新阶段  军区司令部发表本区半月战况

　　战局正走向新阶段
    军区司令部发表本区半月战况
    晋冀鲁豫人民解放军的强大攻势，自三月末在豫北首先发动之后，紧接着便在各个战线上普遍展开，自东南西北四方八面向蒋军主动出击。
    二十天以来，豫北我军在肃清新乡、汲县周围的顽伪之后，便挥戈北上，攻克淇县，连续扫清安阳、汤阴，外围之鹤壁、菜园、宜沟、庞庄、小屯、太保、楚旺、回隆、柳园、观台、水冶、丰乐、洪河屯等据点，彻底毁灭了安、汤、淇、汲间的铁路和观台、安阳支路，扑灭豫北惯匪程道生、司华生、刘乐仙、扈全禄等部，把蒋军在安阳、新乡间的一个突出的锥形阵地切为两段；更以有力一部南出道清收复温县。王仲廉虽于四月五日亲率五旅之众北援安、汤，但为人民解放军的声威所慑，至今仍滞留淇县及其以东之线，裹脚不前。同蒲线我军自四月五日开始出击以来，便以风扫残卷之势，横扫汾河西岸蒋伪，九天之内，连下八城（包括浮山、翼城、绛县、新绛、河津、稷山、万泉、荣河），切断同蒲南段，控制晋陕间重要门户禹门口，并袭入运城飞机场击毁飞机三架，进入了丰饶的民族发祥地河汾三角洲。大军所至，秋毫无犯，久受蒋军蹂躏的人民，均夹道欢迎，称为“天兵”。
    同时，处于敌后的豫皖苏我军，则在粉碎蒋军十六个团兵力的清剿与扫荡之后，主动出击，有力的配合了正面主力作战，半月中连克太康、通许、宁陵、扶沟四城及周家口重镇，越过新黄河，直逼平汉线南段，蒋介石原企图玩弄黄水，在北面堵口，并未能限制我军机动。现在南面又打开一个缺口，我军的机动更大了，蒋介石的阴谋不过是劳民伤财、自欺欺人的蠢举而已。
    北线我军则配合晋察冀兄弟部队，切断正太铁路，收复石门、元氏外围诸据点。
    总计攻势开展以来，平汉、道清、正太、同蒲诸线莫不支离破碎，我军已收复与新解放县城二十一座，毙俘蒋军将近两万人，各线形势，均已改观。
    二十天作战以来，盘踞豫北十余年的惯匪程道生、扈全禄、司华生、张明卿、刘乐仙等部或为我彻底歼灭，或受我严重打击。在晋南则我军扑灭了所有新收复城镇的土顽，这些土顽惯匪在抗战期间依附日寇充当伪军，日本投降后摇身一变又成为蒋介石的忠实爪牙，助纣为虐，残害人民，罪行昭著，人民恨之入骨，此次雄师所指，便都土崩瓦解，为人民除了大害，扫清了我解放区发展的重要障碍。
    四月攻势，还证明了我军是有充分力量收复一切失地的。去年七月自卫战争以来，我军曾因歼灭蒋军有生力量的需要，于逼使敌人支付重大代价以后，主动的放弃了一些城市，并曾一再阐明一旦蒋军有生力量遭受相当数量歼灭之后，这些城市必将重归我手。二十天来，许多城镇即是以极小伤亡，极短时间收复的；另一些城镇则是根本兵不血刃就收复了。现在我们的作战指导方针是日益为广大人民所熟悉了，我们称其为人地两得的方针。即使是远处蒋军深后方的一些城市，由于游击战争普遍开展，敌后我军积极主动的作战，情况亦已发生具有历史性的变化，大量城市已变成游击城市，其特点是互相争夺，几进几出，如太康已为我第六次收复，温县已为我第四次收复，翼城、通许、杞县已为我第三次收复，其他如嘉祥、城武等莫不如此，这说明蒋军兵力不足，战线辽阔，即连其后方点线也不能确保，这是敌后形势走上新阶段的标志。
    胜利的四月的到来，显示着战争正以猛烈的变化，走向新的阶段。（四月一日至十五日）
