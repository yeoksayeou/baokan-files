(From Our Correspondent on the Northern Henan Front, April 26th) During the Northern Henan Campaign, the frontline troops launched a mass propaganda movement with everyone participating and speaking out. Propagandists, cadres at all levels, and soldiers all became extremely active promoters. Day and night, during battles and marches, they universally wrote slogans, distributed propaganda materials, and carried out oral propaganda to the masses. Especially in areas occupied by Chiang, slogans filled the walls of villages they passed through, and good news and cartoons were scattered among the people. Various units of the Fourth and Sixth Columns organized mobile propaganda teams, ensuring that no wall was left blank. The propaganda team of the Second Battalion of a certain regiment wrote 300 slogans in five days. Comrade Huo Quanben of the Ninth Company pasted up more than 40 pieces of propaganda during a night march. Xiao Dexin, the Quartermaster of the Machine Gun Company of the 201st Regiment, wrote 20 slogans on his way to collect supplies. The comrades of the First Battalion's cooking squad, after finishing cooking in each village, would report the news of our army's victory to the masses and explain the relationship between the Eighth Route Army and the people. After hearing their words, an 84-year-old gentleman in Tushan Village touched his little grandson's head and said, "The Eighth Route Army is such a good army, you must join it when you grow up."

During the forced march, comrades from the propaganda team and the propaganda department of the frontline field political department distributed woodcut portraits of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, good news reports, cartoons, and pamphlets on "Chiang Kai-shek's Ten Major Crimes" to the people along the way. During night marches, they carried paste buckets with them, running in front of and behind the队伍 to paste up Generals Liu and Deng's public notices and good news reports on the walls of the villages they passed through.
