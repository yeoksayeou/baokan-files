The military and civilians of Wuzhi County have been cooperating with our main forces in northern Henan to carry out guerrilla warfare since March 8th. By April 15th, after half a month of active and arduous struggle, the guerrilla base areas have expanded dramatically. In the vast plains stretching from the Qin River in the south to the Daokou-Qinghua Railway in the north, centered on Mulandian (Wuzhi New City) and extending northeast to Xiuwu City, and west to the recovered areas of Bo'ai, covering fifty li from east to west and forty li from north to south, there is no trace of the enemy. Our military and government personnel can travel freely. Government notices are posted throughout the villages, and social order is being restored. Masses who had fled to the countryside due to oppression, threats, and deception by the stubborn puppets are now returning home to engage in production. The situation throughout Wuzhi County has changed dramatically. Since March 28th, cadres, militia, work teams, and troops throughout Wuzhi County have been mobilized under the slogans of "Capture local tyrants and secret agents, avenge grievances, and reclaim land and houses" and "Coordinate with the field army to recover lost territories." They launched fierce offensives against the surrounding stubborn puppet strongholds (Mulandian, Dayuan Village, Ningyuan, En Village, Dong Village, etc.), destroyed and damaged all bridges on the Yunliang River section from Wuzhi to Xiuwu and various motor roads on the north bank of the Qin River. Combined with various units boldly advancing towards villages near enemy and puppet strongholds to capture local tyrants, secret agents, and puppet organization personnel, and launching political offensives. On the morning of April 1st, the work team of the Third District, combined with battalion soldiers, advanced into the enemy stronghold of Dayuan Village. Zhang Bingjun's troops, a stubborn puppet force, fled to Mulandian upon hearing the news. The masses in the village smiled broadly upon seeing our troops and cooperated with our army to destroy two large pillboxes and ten small pillboxes. From then on, the work team went deep into the villages near Mulandian and east of Xiaoyuan Village every night, conducting political offensives, distributing leaflets, burning pillboxes, arresting local tyrants, and laying landmines, becoming increasingly energetic. The enemy and puppets came out six times during the day, but were all repelled by us. The Fourth District also combined with the night operations of troops and work teams on the night of April 8th, going deep into the old city of Wuzhi and the southern outskirts of Mulandian City, capturing the big local tyrant of Gao Village and the murderer Yang Shifa. The masses in the Sixth District destroyed the pillboxes and walls of Dong Village, and their activities extended eastward to Dong Village, approaching Xiuwu City, advancing more than twenty li. The work team in the Fifth District often operated in the Shipingling area, approaching En Village and Jiaozuo, compressing the enemy near the strongholds. Local work in various districts is being carried out vigorously under the cover of the work teams and battalion troops. The guerrilla base areas are entering a stage of in-depth consolidation.
