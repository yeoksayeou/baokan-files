　　Shuiye is recovered,
    We will forever commemorate:
    Shuiye Militia Martyr Wang Dongzi
    ·By Beidou·
    Comrade Wang Dongzi was from Dadong Street in Shuiye, 25 years old. His father was an honest farmer. The family only had two mu of poor land and had to rent six mu from the landlord Li Zhenjiang. But even with a year of hard work, they still couldn't eat their fill or keep warm. His father also had to work as a stonemason outside. When Wang Dongzi was thirteen, his father sent him to a cigarette factory to roll cigarettes.

    Ten years ago, when the Japanese devils invaded Shuiye, he didn't want to be a puppet and escaped to work in our public-owned Fourth Cigarette Factory, also serving as the factory's armed committee member. He worked diligently, cherishing the cigarette factory as if it were his own home.

    After the victory against Japan, when we launched a strong attack on the enemy in Shuiye, Comrade Wang Dongzi served as a guide for the troops. On the way, he asked the troops for a gun, but since there were no spare guns, they only gave him two hand grenades. He took the hand grenades and charged alongside the troops.

    After the liberation of Shuiye, Comrade Wang Dongzi returned home, joined the peasant association, and led the peasants in settling accounts of blood and sweat with the traitor, bandit, and landlord Li Zhenjiang. He was elected as the head of Dongguan Street.

    Chiang Kai-shek wouldn't let the masses stand up, and on October 13th of last year, Chiang's troops invaded Shuiye. Comrade Wang Dongzi angrily left home, placed his elderly father in Lin County, and returned to the district office to unite the militia and fight against the returning reactionaries.

    In the battles of Xiaolang Mountain and Xujiagou last year, he used hand grenades to fight and drive the enemy away. The militiamen said, "Where does he get this courage from?!"

    On February 11th, the 40th Army, in coordination with over 300 returning reactionaries, invaded Xujiagou, advancing from Gangxi in two routes. When they reached Xiang Village, our team couldn't hold on and retreated. Comrade Wang Dongzi was resting in a village twelve li away from the village. Hearing the gunfire, he led Huang Lin'er and four others to rush forward. Comrade Dong Yi, the political commissar of Shuiye District, told him to continue resting, but Comrade Wang Dongzi ran on, saying, "I can't stand hearing the enemy's gunfire!"

    When Comrade Wang Dongzi arrived, our team had already moved to the west of Xiang Village, and the enemy was firing at us with intense firepower. Comrade Wang Dongzi ordered three people to attack from the south of the village, while he and Huang Lin'er attacked from the north, splitting into two sides. The enemy had to retreat. When the two of them reached the temple house at the east end of the village, they saw the enemy's machine gun resting there. The brave Comrade Wang Dongzi, just a dozen steps away from the corner of the wall, raised his hand grenade, wanting to leap forward and capture the machine gun. But, just as he took a few steps forward, the machine gun fired, and Comrade Wang Dongzi fell down. Huang Lin'er rushed over to rescue him, but four charges were ineffective, and the militiamen were still pushed back to the west of the village.

    Comrade Wang Dongzi had two bullets in his chest, on the verge of death, the hand grenade in his hand still posed in a throwing position. Two enemies ran over, and Comrade Dongzi couldn't move, only using angry eyes, glared at the enemy.

    "Where are you from?" the enemy sternly asked.

    "I'd rather die than change my name, I...am...Shuiye...Dong...guan...Street Head...Wang...Dong...zi," Wang Dongzi cursed intermittently.

    The enemy roared and stabbed Comrade Dongzi in the abdomen with a bayonet, stabbing several times. The intestines had flowed out of his clothes, but Comrade Dongzi kept cursing. Comrade Wang Dongzi died, his eyes still staring at the enemy, as if saying, "I see where you can escape to!"

    The enemy knew that they had killed Wang Dongzi and wanted to use the corpse to intimidate the people of Shuiye. When the corpse was carried to Dongguan Street, some people in long robes, short jackets, and wearing fur coats pointed at the corpse and cursed, "I see if you still fight me?!" The head of the returning reactionaries boasted, "I have removed this source of trouble for you!" Finally, they made a cruel decision, "Wang Dongzi's corpse is not allowed to be buried, drag it outside the village to feed the dogs."

    The heads of the returning reactionaries also grabbed Comrade Dongzi's mother to the headquarters of the returning reactionaries, and said to her, "Your son fought with us, and we used 500 bullets. You have to compensate us."

    The old lady stubbornly said, "You were the ones who asked him to fight. My family has sold everything to pay for grain and funds. I have no money and no bullets. If you have the ability, ask him!" The returning reactionaries detained her. The old lady didn't shed a tear, only saying one sentence, "Just take my old life!"

    Comrade Wang Dongzi's body was thrown in the field behind the Dong Yan Wang Temple. The poor Shuiye villagers walked past the body, glancing at Comrade Wang Dongzi's corpse. They couldn't bear to look at him, Comrade Wang Dongzi's wounds felt like their own wounds. No one dared to approach, fearing that the landlords would label them as "being in the same gang" or "colluding with the Eighth Route Army." But they didn't forget to protect Wang Dongzi.

    As night fell, every family locked their dogs in the yard. One night passed, and another night passed, Dongzi's corpse, besides the bullet wounds and bayonet wounds from the returning reactionaries, had no dog bites. When the landlord's dog approached Comrade Wang Dongzi's corpse, a stone would fly over from who knows where, hitting it and causing it to bark "Woof woof" and run away with its tail between its legs.

    On the afternoon of the third day, someone carrying 100,000 yuan in fiat currency from who knows where walked into the headquarters of the returning reactionaries. Comrade Wang Dongzi's mother was released. She and several members of her family collected Comrade Wang Dongzi's body and buried him in the ancestral grave in the east of the village. When the Shuiye militiamen elected heroes, everyone posthumously awarded him the honorary title of "First-Class Hero in Killing the Enemy!"

　　水冶收复了，
    我们永远纪念：
    水冶民兵烈士王东子
    ·北斗·
    王东子同志是水冶大东街人，年二十五岁，父亲是一个老实农民。家里只有二亩薄田，只得租种地主李振江六亩地。但是辛苦一年，仍然吃不饱、穿不暖，父亲还得到外边个石匠。王东子十三岁时，父亲就把他送到纸烟厂去卷纸烟。
    十年前，日本鬼子侵入水冶时，他不愿当顺民，逃出来到我公营第四烟厂作工，并任厂内的武装委员。辛勤劳作，爱惜烟厂，像爱自己的家一样。
    抗战胜利后，我强攻水冶敌人，王东子同志给部队作了向导。走在路上，他要求部队给他一支枪，因为没有多余的枪，只给了他两个手榴弹。他就拿着手榴弹和部队一同冲锋。
    解放水冶后，王东子同志回了家，参加了农会，领导农民与汉奸土匪地主李振江算了血汗帐，被选为东关街长。
    蒋介石不让群众翻身，去年十月十三日蒋军打进水冶。王东子同志愤怒离开了家，把老父安置在林县，又返回区公所团结起民兵与还乡团，进行斗争。
    在去年小狼山的战斗与许家沟战斗，他都用手榴弹拚上去把敌人赶跑。民兵们说：“他这个勇劲不知是从那里来的？！”
    二月十一日，四十军配合着还乡团三百余人，又向许家沟岗西分两路进犯了。当进至相村时，我们的一队坚持不住退下来了。王东子同志正在距村十二里的某庄休息。听见枪声，他带了黄林儿等五人奔向前去。水冶区政委董毅同志说，要他继续休息，王东子同志且奔且说：“我就不能听见敌人的枪响”！
    王东子同志赶到时，我们的小队已转移到相村西地，敌人以密集的火力向我射击着，王东子同志令三人由村南，他与黄林儿两人由村北分两侧猛袭，敌人不得不缩回头去。当他俩赶到村东头庙房时，看见敌人的机枪转在那里休息，勇敢的王东子同志，在十几步远的墙角下，提着手榴弹，想纵步上去，缴获这支机枪。但，刚进前几步时，机枪急叫，王东子同志就应声倒下了。黄林儿冲过来抢救，四次的冲锋无效，民兵们仍被压回村西来。
    王东子同志胸中两弹，奄奄一息，手中的手榴弹，仍摆着掷出去的姿势。两名敌人跑过来，东子同志已不能转动，只用愤怒的眼睛，怒视着敌人。
    “你是那里人？”敌人厉声问。
    “老子死不改名，老子……是……水冶……东……关……街长……王……东……子”王东子断续的斥骂。
    敌人咆哮起来，用枪刺向东子同志腹部，连刺数次，肠子已流到衣外，但东子同志仍不停的骂着。王东子同志死了，两眼依旧瞪视着敌人，好像是说：“我看你逃向那里”！
    敌人知道打死的是王东子，就要把尸体拿来威吓水冶的老百姓，当尸体抬到了东关街上时，一些长袍短褂穿大皮袄的人，指着尸体骂道：“我看你还斗争我？！”还乡团长夸耀着说：“我给你们除了这个害根子！”最后，他们来了个残忍的决定，“王东子的死尸不许埋，拖到村外喂狗。”
    还乡团的保长们，又把东子同志的娘抓到还乡团的队部里，对她说：“你的儿子和我们打仗，我们消耗了五百发子弹，你得包赔我们。”
    老娘倔强的说：“打仗是你们找他。我家出粮出款已卖的一干二净，我没钱也没子弹，你们有本事向他要吧！”还乡团把她扣押起来，老太太一直没有眼泪，只有一句话：“就是我这条老命”！
    王东子同志的尸体，被扔在东阎王庙后的地里，穷苦的水冶乡亲们，从尸体走过，用眼斜溜了一下王东子同志的尸体，他们不忍看他，王东子同志的创伤好像自己的创伤。没人敢近前，怕地主们给按上“是一伙”、“通八路”的帽子。但是他们没有忘了爱护王东子。
    夜深了，每家都把狗牢关在院里。一夜过去了，又一夜过去了，东子同志的尸体，除下还乡团的枪伤、刺刀伤外，没有狗的牙印。当地主家的狗接近王东子同志的尸体时，就会不知从那里飞过来一块石头，打得它“汪汪”的叫着夹着尾巴窜去。
    第三天午后，有人挟着不知从那里筹来的十万元法币走进还乡团的队部，王东子同志的母亲被放出来了，她同几个本家收殓了王东子同志的尸体，埋藏在村东的祖坟上。水冶民兵们选举英雄的时候，大家追赠他以“一等杀敌英雄”的光荣称号！
