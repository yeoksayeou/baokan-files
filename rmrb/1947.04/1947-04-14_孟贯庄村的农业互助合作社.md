	Agricultural Mutual Aid Cooperative in Mengguanzhuang Village
	Nai Gu

	Mengguanzhuang Village, in Jize County, Southern Hebei, is near the Fuyang River. The land quality isn't very good, with a lot of sandy alkaline soil. Good land yields about four dou per mu in a bumper harvest, but the saline soil is very rich. Historically, farmers have valued agricultural and sideline production almost equally. During the Anti-Japanese War, the village was in a severe guerrilla warfare environment, surrounded by four enemy strongholds within five li, and the enemy and puppets carried out cruel destruction. In 1942, it suffered a major famine, after which the farmers' productive forces were almost completely destroyed; the village population decreased from 840 to 500; 187 men and 153 women died; all 92 head of draft animals were lost, and agricultural and sideline production tools were also greatly reduced. Under these circumstances, it was impossible to restore agricultural and sideline production without taking the path of organization. This was the situation before the establishment of the village's agricultural mutual aid cooperative.

	The agricultural mutual aid cooperative is organized into groups, bringing together the land, labor, draft animals, and other major means of production of each household for cooperative management and profit distribution. Because land, labor, etc., are privately owned by each household, and the fruits of production also belong to each household privately, and it is necessary to obtain reasonable income, the cooperative method adopts land and labor as shares, and dividends are distributed according to the shares (generally 40% for land and 60% for labor). Land is evaluated as standard land based on its quality, degree of wasteland, and distance from the village, and shares are determined based on the standard land. Labor is evaluated as labor shares based on physical strength, technical skill, and other conditions; ten points are a full labor standard, and those with ten points are a full share, otherwise it is a fractional share. For example, in Wang Xinxiu's group: the whole group has five households. Wang Sugui originally had 24 mu of land, which was converted to 21 mu of standard land after democratic evaluation; Wang Qingtai originally had 48 mu, converted to 40 mu; Wang Xinxiu originally had 8 mu, converted to 6 mu; Wang Guifang originally had 10 mu, converted to 8 mu; and the Li family originally had 18 mu, converted to 15 mu. The whole group has four full male laborers, all with ten full shares; three women with five shares each; and four children with four shares each. After the shares are evaluated, the land is divided according to the total output of the whole group according to the shares; if there is unexpected loss due to natural disaster, the loss is shared by the whole group. Labor is divided according to shares and work points, with more labor receiving more, and vice versa. For this reason, it is necessary to keep records of work points, dividing each day into five short periods, and recording how many periods are worked; better groups also implement the method of recording work points by time and by job, and distributing dividends according to work points. There are roughly two methods of draft animal cooperation: one is that the cows are bought jointly by the group, with money allocated according to land area or per capita share. Those who allocate money according to land do not count work points when using the cows (except for sideline production); those who allocate money per capita count work points when using the cows, and designate a person (who is good at managing livestock) to be responsible for feeding, with half of the cow manure going to the feeder and half being shared. Fodder is generally allocated evenly according to land area. The other is that the cows are freely shared by each household, and work points are counted when using them. The value of cow labor is generally determined according to the agricultural season and the size of the cow, sometimes one cow labor equals four full labor work points, sometimes three work points. The income from cow labor is shared by the cow owner. In some groups, because the cows are allocated according to land and not jointly purchased, the cows are calculated as three full laborers throughout the year, regardless of the different uses of agriculture and sideline production. There are also two methods of farm tool cooperation: one is that the farm tools are bought jointly by the group, and managed by the group leader or a skilled technician, and allocated according to needs when used; the other is that the farm tools are bought by each household, and concentrated together when used, and managed by the group leader or a skilled technician. Damage is compensated according to the situation, with money allocated according to land or per capita. There are three methods of fertilization: one is free fertilization, with prices set according to the quantity and quality of fertilization; for example, some groups stipulate that a large cart of grass manure (1,500 jin) is equivalent to three dou of coarse grain. The other is unified fertilization, with each household's fertilizer concentrated and used according to plan, and fertilizer accumulators enjoy certain rewards (priced according to the quantity and quality of fertilizer). Still another is fertilization without compensation, with whoever's fertilizer being used on whoever's land. Everyone already feels that the third method is not good.

	After such mutual aid and cooperation, each household's production is organized under the unified leadership of the group (except for textile and other sporadic production), and the entire cultivation plan is unified. This unification is generally based on the production requirements of each household and decided after democratic discussion. Some groups also implement the adjustment of certain crops when necessary, selecting suitable crops according to land characteristics; those suitable for growing vegetables grow more vegetables, those suitable for growing wheat grow more wheat, and better groups can arrange life according to the production season and the needs of the crops, doing whatever should be done; whichever piece of land should be planted, hoed, or harvested, that piece is organized for cultivation first. Better groups can organize the supply and demand of labor according to the needs of production tasks, doing whatever can be done, appropriately adjusting various technical talents, and flexibly changing labor units. For example, during the busy wheat harvest season, all men, women, old, and young, all full and semi-laborers are organized to form a large labor unit to rush the wheat harvest. After the wheat harvest slows down slightly, the large group is divided into small groups again, with some people plowing the land and others threshing. The best groups combine agriculture and sideline production regularly, which can make good use of surplus labor. They divide the work of salt extraction and farming (except during busy periods), record work points on time, and distribute dividends according to work points. It is stipulated that 100 jin of salt is eight work points, children picking 100 jin of firewood is one work point (for boiling salt), and women boiling a pot of salt is one work point. Scraping soil, pushing soil, and filling ponds are determined according to the situation (because the thickness of the soil and the distance of the road are slightly different). Dividends are generally calculated evenly according to the number of labor work points, and the division is the same for planting land and extracting salt. Some groups have special personnel to go to the market during the busy farming season to sell the group's agricultural and sideline products and purchase daily necessities for each household, which is equivalent to one land labor work point per day, and meal expenses are reimbursed from the profits (generally stipulated as one jin of pancake per meal). During the busy season, the groups in the whole village sometimes organize mutual exchange of labor or selling of labor.

	After a year of hard work last year, all 128 households in Mengguanzhuang Village have been organized, forming three brigades and 29 groups (of which 26 groups are conducted according to the above methods), and a production director was democratically elected. In last year's production campaign, 721 mu of the village's 1,021 mu of cultivated wasteland was eliminated, 20,000 jin of salt were sold, earning 900,000 yuan (excluding winter production), the number of draft animals increased from five to seventeen, the number of salt pans increased by sixteen, and there were also many increases in other farm tools.

　　孟贯庄村的农业互助合作社
    乃谷
    冀南鸡泽县孟贯庄村，靠近滏阳河，土地质量不很好，沙碱地多，好地在丰收时，每亩产量约在四斗左右，但盐土很丰富。在历史上，农民对农副业生产几乎都是同样看重的。在抗日战争时期，这村处在一个严重的游击战争环境中，周围五里地有四个敌据点，敌伪破坏得残酷。一九四二年，遭过一次大灾荒，灾荒以后，农民的生产力几乎摧毁殆尽；全村人口由八百四十人减少到五百人；男的死亡了一百八十七人，女的死亡了一百五十三人；九十二头耕畜完全没有了，农副业生产工具也大大的减少了，在这种情况下，要想恢复农副业生产，不走组织起来的道路，困难是无法克服的。这就是该村农业互助合作社产生之前的情况。
    农业互助合作社是以小组为单位，把各户的土地、劳力、耕牛等主要生产手段都组织起来，合作经营，实行分红制。因为土地劳力等属于各户所私有，生产果实也归各户私有，并须求得所得合理，所以在合作办法上，就采取土地劳力作股，按股分红（一般是按地四劳六分红）。土地根据质量好坏，荒芜程度，距村远近等情况评定为标准地，以标准地定股。劳力按体力强弱，技术高低等条件，评定为劳力股；十分为一个全劳力标准，够十分者为一整股，反之为分股。如王心秀组：全组五户，王苏贵原有地二十四亩，经民主评定后，折标准地廿一亩；王清太原有地四十八亩，折地四十亩；王心秀原有八亩，折地六亩；王桂芳原地十亩，折地八亩；李氏原地十八亩，折地十五亩。全组男全劳力四个，都是十分整股；妇女三个都是五分股，儿童四个都是四分股，股分评定后，土地按全组总产量按股分红；如因天灾遭受意外损失，损失部分全组共担。劳力按股按工分红，劳力多者多分，反之少分。为此就必须实行记工，每天分五个小晌，作几晌记几晌；比较好的小组，且实行按时按活计工，按工分红的办法。耕牛合作大体上是两种办法：一种是牛由小组共买，按地亩或按人股摊钱。按地摊钱者使用时不计工（副业生产例外）；按人摊钱者使用时计工，推定专人（善于经管牲畜者）负责饲养，牛粪一半归饲养人，一半伙分。草料一般多是按地亩均摊，另一种是牛由各户自由结股伙买，使用时计工。牛力计工一般多是根据农业季节及牛力大小而定，有时一个牛工顶四个全劳力工，有时顶三个工。牛工所得，归牛主分有。有的小组因为牛是按地摊不伙买的，所以牛就全年都以三个全劳力计算，不分农副业的不同使用。农具合作也有两种办法：一种是农具由组内共买，由组长或由技术能手保管，使用时按需要分配；一种是农具由各户自买，使用时集中起来，由小组长或能手保管。损坏时按情况赔偿，按地或按人摊钱。施肥办法有三种：一种是自由施肥，根据施肥数量和质量作价，如有的小组规定一大车草粪（一千五百斤）作粗粮三斗。另一种是统一施肥，各户的肥料集中起来，有计划的使用，积肥户享受一定的报酬（按肥料数量和质量作价）。再一种是无代价的施肥，谁的肥料用在谁的地上。大家已经感到第三种办法不好。
    这样互助合作以后，各户的生产就在小组的统一领导之下组织起来（纺织及其他零星生产例外），整个耕作计划是统一的，这个统一一般是以各户的生产要求为基础，经过民主讨论以后决定的：有些小组在必要时还实行某种作物的调剂，根据土地特性选种适宜作物；宜种菜者多种菜，宜种麦者多种麦，比较好的小组能够按生产季节，按庄稼需要，有计划的按排生活，该做啥就做啥；那一块土地该种该锄该收，就先组织那一块的耕作。比较好的小组，能够按生产任务的需要，有计划的组织劳力的供需，能做啥就做啥，适当的调剂各种技术人材，灵活的变化劳动单位。如在麦收大忙时期，就把所有男女老少一切全半劳力都组织起来，结成一个大的劳动单位，突击麦收。麦收稍缓，即又化大组为小组，某些人翻地，某些人打场。最好的小组，农副业经常结合，这样能很好的利用剩余劳力，他们淋盐和种地分工进行（除大忙时期外），按时计工，按工分红。规定一百斤盐八个工，儿童拾一百斤柴一个工（熬盐用柴火），妇女熬一锅盐顶一个工。刮土、推土、装池看情况决定（因为土厚薄、路远近稍有差别）。分红一般多是统一按劳力工数平均计算，种地和淋盐的一样分。有的小组在农忙时期有专人赶集，推销组内农副业生产品，代各户购买日用必需品，一天顶一个土地劳力工，饭费在营利中报销（一般规定一顿饭一斤烙饼）。全村组与组之间，在大忙时期有时也组织互相变工或卖工。
    孟贯庄村经去年一年的努力，全村一百二十八户都组织起来了，成立了三个大队，二十九个小组（其中二十六个小组，按上述办法进行的），民选了一个生产主任。在去年一年的生产运动中，全村一千零二十一亩熟荒消灭了七百二十一亩，卖盐二万斤，赚洋九十万元（冬季生产除外），耕畜由五头增加到十七头，盐锅增加了十六个，其他农具也都有许多增加。
