Ten Years of Struggle Turns the Tables
Wuxiang's Han Bi Realizes Land to the Tiller
Wei Xiaoquan
　　The Great Production Movement of 1945 was carried out with great vigor. Men, women, old and young, were involved in the movement, participating in mutual aid groups. The Red Star Brigade became famous in Taihang, creating a new heroic movement of work-point accounting, work evaluation, and mass rewards. Forty-seven heroes and models emerged, and twenty lazy people and twelve petty thieves were transformed. Han Bi became a model production village in the county.
　　After three years of struggle, mass organizations expanded to 502 people, and the Farmers' Association expanded to 167 people, accounting for 24.7% of the population. However, class consciousness was not clear, and there were still 19 rich peasants and 2 managing landlords in the Farmers' Association.
　　In the past three years, land ownership has changed considerably. The land owned by landlords decreased from 45.61% of the total land to 5.16%. Each landlord owned 65.9 mu, decreasing to 10 mu. Absolute poverty has been eliminated, and 43 poor peasant households have risen to become new middle peasants. The 13 demobilized soldiers who settled down have all obtained land to cultivate.

(1)　Check Reduction in Spring of 1945 and 1946

　　Under the influence of the emancipation movement in the new areas and the check reduction movement in the old areas, the check reduction in Han Bi began. Due to the lack of a clear direction, it did not form a movement. Instead, accounts were settled on a case-by-case basis, and the camp was chaotic. The big landlord Wei Zhongxiang and the rich peasant Chen Yinhang were calculated to owe 3,000 yuan. Seven middle and poor peasant households were also liquidated. Cadres earned wages by calculating accounts. The masses reflected, "Cadres are catching lice for the old rich." The situation at that time can be seen from the following households that were struggled against and the households that benefited:
　　25 households were liquidated: 2 landlords, 2 managing landlords, 11 rich peasants, 3 upper-middle peasants, 1 poor peasant, and 6 middle peasants. A total of 129 problems were cleared, including 8 rent reductions, 59 debt clearings, 19 asset clearings, 14 bully problems, 12 embezzlement problems, and 17 other problems. Among the 20 problems cleared from the six middle peasant households that were struggled against, there were 9 debt clearings, 10 embezzlement problems, and 1 asset clearing. There was only 1 debt clearing for the 1 poor peasant household. A total of 737 mu of land, 19 houses, 885 shi of grain, 55 sheep, and 309,241 yuan of Jicha were cleared out.
　　84 households benefited: 32 poor peasants, 43 middle peasants, 7 upper-middle peasants, 4 rich peasants, and 1 landlord. From the households that benefited, it can be seen that the class viewpoint was not clear, and rich peasants and landlords also benefited.
　　Although the land change was not significant after this movement, the land problem of the peasants was basically solved through the Great Production Movement of 1945 and 1946. Twenty poor peasant households rose to become middle peasants. Landlords and rich peasants accounted for 8.07% of the households, 14.06% of the population, and 4.4% of the land. Each landlord averaged 3.28 mu, and each rich peasant averaged 5.06 mu. Middle peasants accounted for 84.19% of the households, 82.7% of the population, and 85.4% of the land. Each middle peasant averaged 4.53 mu, and each poor peasant averaged 3.2 mu. However, the entire village had a total of 235 households, 718 people, and 333.8 mu of land, averaging 46.4 mu per person.

(2)　Fill in the Gaps and Make Up the Deficiencies to Realize Land to the Tiller

　　Since last December, for more than 80 days, we have been carrying out in-depth mobilization and backward movement to fill in the gaps and make up the deficiencies. Now the peasants are celebrating the return of the land and are organizing to carry out the Great Production Movement.

A. Poor Friends Unite to Struggle

　　Last December, a land survey was organized during the mass movement, and some investigations were conducted. It was found that 43 households with 104 people were still "gully households." Forty-nine "backward" masses were backward because of their age. Eight households were dilapidated, and middle peasants accounted for half of them. Immediately afterwards, various people's meetings were held: cadre meetings, meetings of emancipated people and unemancipated people, women's meetings, and poor tenant farmer meetings, with a total of more than 320 people. The following thoughts and problems were discovered from the meetings:
　　1. The masses were "afraid of offending people," "afraid of retaliation," and thought that "proposals would not work." The elderly believed that "painful experiences," "what will be will be," and "fate" hindered the masses. For example, Ju Zhen Tian said, "Grandsons will always be grandsons, and grandfathers will always be grandfathers." Chou Hai ("backward" extremely poor) said, "We are afraid of the landlord Wei Wenlan. In the past, because the cadres forced us to ask about the years, we didn't settle the accounts, and we didn't get emancipated. Anyway, it's rich Wenlan and poor Chou Hai."
　　2. From the discussions, it was realized that last year's land survey was not thorough. Cadres caught lice for the old rich and did not break down personal relations.
　　3. Feudalism did not bow its head, and poor friends were not of one mind. Not only had the landlords not collapsed, but they also controlled the regime. The big landlord Wei Qincai was the grain director, Wei Wenlan was the education director, and the son of the managing landlord Shi Chengqian was the deputy village chief. The feudal rich peasant Han Jingqi was the anti-conscription director. In this way, they still ruled the masses.
　　After discovering the above problems, poor friends were organized, from 26 to 444 people, to elect group leaders and team leaders. A three-day and three-night campaign of telling grievances, settling accounts, and finding the root causes of poverty was launched, and 16 tails were found. Most of the "backward" masses spoke. In West Street, 31 were backward, and only one did not speak. The cadres took the initiative to conduct self-criticism and swore to the masses, "For the gullies, for the masses, no retaliation, unite to the end, eliminate feudalism." The following mass slogans were put forward: "Think of the miserable things of the past, emancipation is this time. Tell all the grievances, clarify the principles, and turn the body inside out. Middle and poor peasants are one family, we were all oppressed in the past. Don't eat a meal from the old rich, don't smoke a cigarette from the old rich." Under the initial awakening of the masses, struggles were carried out against Wei Wenlan and Wei Jing. Forty-two people, including thirteen "backward" masses, told their grievances against Wei Wenlan. Sixty-eight people told their grievances against Wei Jing. At this time, the movement reached a climax.

B. Class Demarcation

　　Before the 24th day of the first lunar month, the work of demarcating components and evaluating grades was carried out among the masses. The masses were very concerned about this matter, and no one wanted to be an old middle peasant. From the demarcation of components, the targets of struggle were clarified, "gully households" were evaluated, the thinking of middle peasants was stabilized, and 16 rich peasant households dedicated their land. However, during this period, loopholes were exploited, and due to the Lunar New Year, ideological mobilization was neglected, and the time was dragged on for a month.

C. Passing on Suffering, Telling Suffering, Emancipating the Body and Mind Again

　　In mid-February, a study was made of the previous stage of the movement. It was believed that the masses had risen up in the first stage of the movement. It was also correct to clarify the class and identify the targets in the second stage of class demarcation, but ideological mobilization was neglected. The "backward" masses were not fully mobilized. "Fear of retaliation," "painful experiences," and "uselessness" still bound the masses, and they did not dare to boldly raise problems. Cadres had "complacency and fatigue" thoughts, thinking that "the movement is thorough, and we can't bear it if we keep going." Middle peasants demanded production, but because the distribution of fruits was narrow, middle peasants expressed negativity.
　　Based on the above situation, it was proposed to overcome complacency and fatigue, further mobilize the "backward," and carry out systematic class education to shift to production.
　　First, an expanded meeting of cadres and emancipated group leaders was convened. Cadres cleared their minds, carried out mass inspection movements, and further understood that the masses were not fully mobilized, and feudalism was hidden. The leadership core was not based on poor and hired peasants. Half of them were middle peasants, and rich peasants were group leaders. Young women in their teens and seventies were group leaders. They did not have a deep understanding of exploitation and could not guide the masses to tell their sufferings and struggles.
　　Secondly, with the poor and hired peasants as the backbone, a meeting of hundreds of suffering people was convened, and the transmission of suffering, visiting suffering, and telling suffering were launched. More than 40 people told their suffering every day, and everyone cried sadly.
　　Mass telling-suffering meetings were held for two days, and three to four hundred people carried out telling-suffering and reasoning struggles against the managing landlord Shi Chengqian, the landlords Wei Peiliang and Wei Zhong, and the feudal rich peasants Han Shuquan and Chen Yinhang. We did our best to express our sufferings and grievances, and gained the sympathy of the broad masses. A large number of new poor and hired activists emerged. Hired worker Li Xiaocheng and elder Li Xiangguo were the most outstanding. In their telling of suffering, they educated the youth, telling the youth not to forget the suffering of their ancestors. Yang Si's woman, the miner Donghua's brother-in-law, also woke up with the help of the masses and actively mobilized the "backward." "Backward" mobilized "backward," forming a conscious movement.
　　In order to further understand the thinking of the masses and carry out systematic education, symposiums of poor and hired peasants, middle peasants, and women were convened. From the symposiums of 34 women, it was learned that women had thoughts such as "emancipation is a man's business" and "fear of retaliation." From the symposiums of 35 middle peasants, it was learned that most middle peasants had the "gully household" thought of fearing "cutting leeks," daring not to get rich, and fearing "another round of filling up" and "fear of retaliation." From the symposiums of poor and hired peasants, we learned about the landlord's exploitation of the peasants and how the landlord became rich. At the symposiums, the above-mentioned thoughts were initially resolved.
　　Once again, we calculated the exploitation accounts, calculated the emancipation accounts, summarized the ten years of struggle, clarified the minds of cadres and the masses, and clarified the direction of future work. Ninety-six new and old activists, cadres, and 36 party members held a three-day meeting. From tracing how the landlords became rich, we talked about the experience of ten years of emancipation struggle. In the calculation of the emancipation account, everyone specifically recognized the landlord's cruel exploitation and the poor's root causes of poverty in Nanzhai. Recalling the process of ten years of struggle, we further recognized the landlord's conspiracy, viciousness, and constant attempts to restore the old order. At the same time, we also realized that the peasants' united strength was great, the old cadres cherished their glorious history, and the new cadres should respect the old cadres. This relationship was initially resolved. This stage was actually class consciousness and historical consciousness. From checking and summarizing the previous stage of the movement, we recognized that the previous stage had achievements, but the "backward" masses had not been fully mobilized, superstitious ideas had not been eliminated, and the land relationship after land reform was still confused. After the debate, it was clarified that:
　　1. Land reform is still a private system, not communism. Therefore, the land is movable, and buying and selling are free. Renting and pawning still exist between farmers. We should work hard to produce and get rich. Wu Manyou is the direction for the future. After the distribution of fruits, we should work and produce.
　　2. If Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan are not overthrown, the struggle will not stop. We should be vigilant against feudalism. "We can strike the body but not the heart," "Prevent droughts every year, and prevent thieves every night."
　　3. Breaking superstition, we understood some scientific common sense. There are no ghosts or gods. Talking to ghosts is a mental disorder. Things that have not been seen cannot be said. For example, during the War of Resistance Against Japan, we often dreamed of the enemy surrounding and sweeping, but after the counter-offensive, the peasants in the hinterland did not dream. Gods are the tools of the landlord class to fool the peasants. From the peasants' personal experience, if they do not burn incense to the mountain god on the second day of February, the wolves will not eat the sheep.
　　From the symposium, recalling the history and calculating the big accounts, the class consciousness of cadres and activists was greatly improved, their minds were cleared, and many confused ideas were resolved. The ideas of armed self-defense and production were also clarified.
　　Finally, on March 4, a conference of more than 400 people was held to celebrate the return of the land. We summarized the previous stage of the movement, calculated the accounts of ten years of struggle, conducted a general telling of sufferings, distributed fruits, and launched a mass inspection of exploitation accounts and emancipation accounts. Every mass who attended the meeting remembered thinking about the old days, "The phoenix spreads its wings twice, oppressing the poor so that they can't breathe, the golden thread hangs the gourd, sucking the blood and sweat of the poor." Today, "The phoenix head is broken and the gourd is opened, and the blood and sweat of the poor are poured out." In the future, "Emancipation does not forget the Communist Party, armed production defends the good times." It was also proposed that "Don't leave a poor friend behind, don't let a household not be emancipated." "Poor friends are of one mind, and don't let the landlords exploit loopholes." After this filling-up movement, Han Bi Village completely realized land to the tiller. Three landlord households were eliminated, and 17 poor and hired peasant households rose to become new middle peasants. At present, the population and land ownership of each class in the village are listed below:

| Component  | Households | Population | Land    | Total Output | Average Land per Person | Output per Mu | Average Grain per Person |
| :--------- | :---------- | :--------- | :------ | :----------- | :----------------------- | :------------ | :------------------------ |
| Old Rich Peasant | 6         | 41         | 117.6   | 180.96       | 2.69                     | 1.54         | 4.1                       |
| Old Upper-Middle  | 4         | 17         | 90.9    | 90.9         | 5.34                     | 1.00         | 5.36                      |
| New Upper-Middle | 17        | 74         | 350.5   | 391.73       | 4.74                     | 1.12         | 5.28                      |
| New Middle Peasant | 142       | 388        | 2002.7  | 1905.46      | 5.17                     | 0.91         | 4.91                      |
| Old Middle Peasant | 42        | 106        | 488.2   | 586.48       | 4.59                     | 1.20         | 5.53                      |

    十年斗争翻透身
    武乡韩璧实现耕者有其田
    魏效泉
    四五年大生产运动搞的最有劲，男女老少都卷入运动参加互助组，红星大队闻名于太行，创造了折工计工评分及群众性奖励的新英雄主义运动，涌现了四七个英雄模范，改造了廿个懒汉、十二个小偷，韩璧便成为全县生产模范村。
    经过三年的斗争，群众组织扩大到五○二人，农会扩大到一六七人，占人口百分之二四·七，但阶级性不明确，尚有一九个富农、二个经营地主在农会里。
    三年来土地变化相当大，地主土地由占总土地百分之四五·六一减少到占百分之五·一六。每人六五·九亩减到每人一○亩。赤贫已被消灭，又有四三户贫雇农上升为新中农。新安家的一三户荣退军人都获得地种。
    丁、四六年春查减
    在新区翻身运动与老区查减的影响下，韩璧查减开始了，由于方针不明故未形成运动，只是有事就算账，阵营混乱，大地主魏忠向、富农陈银汉算出三千元，中贫农七户也被清算，干部算账赚工资。群众反映“干部给老财捉虱子”。从下列被斗争户与得利户可以看出当时情况：
    清算对象二五户：地主二户，经地二户，富农一一户，富中三户，贫农一主，中农六户。共清算问题一二九件，其中减退租八件，清债五九件，清资一九件，恶霸一四件及贪污一二件，其他一七件。被斗六户中农二十件问题中，清债九件，贪污十件，清资一件。贫农一户只一件清债。共清出土地七三七亩，房子一九间，粮食八八五石，羊五五只，冀钞三十万九千二百四十一元。
    得利户八四户：贫农三二户，中农四三户，富中七户，富农四户，地主一户。从得利户可看到阶级观点是不明确的，富农地主都得了利。
    经过这段运动，虽然土地变动不大，但经四五年大生产运动，农民土地问题基本上解决。二○户赤贫农上升为中农。地主富农占户数百分之八·○七，人口占百分之一四·○六，土地占百分之四·四，地主每人平均三·二八亩，富农每人平均五·○六亩。中农占户数百分之八四·一九，占人口百分之八二·七，占土地百分之八五·四，每人平均四·五三亩，贫农每人平均三·二亩。但全村共二三五户，七一八口人，三三三·八亩土地，每人平均四六·四亩。
  （三）填平补齐实现耕者有其田
    自去冬十二月以来，先后八十余日，进行了填平补齐深入发动落后运动，现在农民在欢庆土地回家，在组织起来开展大生产运动。
    甲、穷朋友团结起斗争
    去冬十二月，在群运中组织了查田酝酿，并作了些调查，发现四三户一○四人，还是圪洞户。四九个“落后”群众，原因是年岁大。破落户八人，中农占一半。紧接着便召开了各种人会议：干部会、翻身人与未翻身人会、妇女会、贫佃农会，共三百二十余人。从会议中发现了以下几个思想与问题：
    １、群众“怕惹人”、“怕报复”、“提议不顶事”，老人们认为“痛过肉”，“圪能”，“命运”思想障碍着群众。如聚珍田说：“孙的总是孙的，爷爷总是爷爷”，丑孩（“落后”赤贫）说：“咱害怕地主魏文兰，过去因干部逼问年限，咱没算账身没翻了，反正是富文兰、穷丑孩”。
    ２、从酝酿中认识了去年查田不彻底，干部给老财捉了虱子，没有打破情面。
    ３、封建未低头，穷朋友不一心。地主不但没垮台，还掌握着政权，大地主魏钦财粮主任，魏文兰教育主任，经营地主史成千儿子任副村长，封建富农韩景奇任抗勤主任，这样仍统治着群众。
    发现上述问题，即组织了穷朋友由二六人至四四四人选举了组长队长，开展了三天三夜诉苦算账找穷根，找出一六个尾巴，大部“落后”群众说了话。西街三一个落后，只一个没说话。干部主动的作了自我检讨，并向群众宣誓“为圪洞，为群众，不报复，团结到底，消灭封建”。并提出以下群众口号“想想从前凄惶事，翻身就是这一次。苦要诉尽，理要讲清，身要翻透。中贫农是一家，从前咱都受压迫。不吃老财一顿饭，不吸老财一根烟”。在群众初步觉悟的行动下，对魏文兰、魏镜进行了斗争，对魏文兰诉苦者四十二人，内有十三个“落后”群众，对魏镜诉苦者六八人，这时运动走向了高潮。
    乙、划阶级
    阴历正月廿四日前，在群众中进行划成分、评等级工作。群众非常关怀这件事，谁也不愿当旧中农。从划成分中，明确了斗争对象，评出圪洞户，安定了中农思想，富农十六户进行了献田。但这段由于钻了内货，以及旧历年关，忽视了思想发动，时间拖了一个月。
    丙、传苦诉苦翻身又翻心。
    二月半对前段运动作了研究，认为第一段运动群众是起来了；在第二段划阶级明对象也是对的，但忽视了思想发动，“落后”群众还未充分发动，“怕报复”，“痛过肉”，“不顶事”还束缚着群众，不敢大胆提出问题；干部存在着“自满疲惫”思想，认为“运动已彻底，再闹下去实在吃不住了”。中农要求生产，因分果实面窄，中农表示消极。
    根据上述情况，提出克服自满疲惫思想，进一步发动“落后”，进行系统的阶级教育转向生产。
    首先召开了扩大干部与翻身组长会议，干部清醒头脑，开展群众性检查运动，进一步了解了群众发动不充分，封建有隐藏。领导核心不是以贫雇为骨干，有一半是中农，富农有当翻身组长的，十六、七岁的青年妇女当组长，她们对剥削体会不深，不能引导群众诉苦斗争。
    其次以贫雇为骨干，召开了百余人苦人会议，展开了传苦访苦与诉苦，一天有四十多人诉，每个人都伤心痛哭。
    群众性的诉苦会开了二天，三、四百人对经营地主史成千、地主魏培良、魏忠、封建富农韩书泉、陈银汉进行了诉苦说理斗争。作到了苦诉透、气出透，取得了广大群众的同情，涌现大批新的贫雇积极分子。雇工李效成，老人李仙果，是最出色的，他们在诉苦中教育了青年，叫青年祖辈不要忘了先人们之苦。杨四则女人，矿工冬花姐夫在群众帮助下，他们也觉悟起来，积极动员“落后”，“落后”动员“落后”，形成了自觉运动。
    为了进一步了解群众思想，开展系统教育，召开了贫雇、中农、妇女座谈会。从三十四个妇女座谈中，了解到妇女存在着“翻身是男人事”、“怕报复”等思想。从三十五个中农座谈中，了解到大部中农存在着怕“割韭菜”的“疙瘩户”思想，不敢发家，怕“再来一次填平”，“怕报复”。从贫雇座谈中，了解了地主对农民的剥削及地主是如何发了家。在座谈会上，都初步解决了上述思想。
    再次算剥削账，算翻身账，总结十年斗争，清醒干部群众头脑，明确今后工作方向，由九十六个新老积极分子、干部及党员卅六人开了三天会。从追算地主如何发家，谈到十年翻身斗争的经验。算翻身账中，大家具体认识了地主的残酷剥削，穷人的穷根子在南寨。回忆十年斗争过程，进一步认识了地主之阴谋毒辣与时刻企图复辟，同时也体会了农民团结力量大，老干部爱护自己光荣历史，新干部应尊重老干部，这个关系初步获得了解决。这段实际上是阶级自觉与历史自觉。从检查总结前段运动，认识了前段有成绩，但“落后”群众还未充分发动起来，迷信思想还未消除，对土地改革后土地关系究竟怎样还是糊涂着，经过争论明确了：
    １、土地改革后仍是私有制度，还不是共产主义，因之土地是动的，买卖自由，农民之间租典仍然存在，好好生产劳动发家，吴满有是今后的方向，分果实后应劳动生产。
    ２、蒋介石、阎锡山不打倒，斗争不会停，对封建应警惕“打了身打不了心”，“年年防旱，夜夜防贼”。
    ３、打破迷信懂得了些科学常识，没有鬼神，跟鬼是神经错乱，没有见过的事说不来。如抗战期间，常梦敌人包围扫荡，反攻后腹地农民不梦了。神是地主阶级愚昧农民的工具，从农民亲身体会到二月二不给山神烧香，狼也吃不了羊。
    从座谈回忆历史大算账，干部积极分子阶级觉悟大大提高了一步，清醒了头脑，解决了不少糊涂思想，武装自卫生产思想也明确了。
    最后于三月四日，开了四百余人的庆祝土地回家大会，总结前段运动，算十年斗争账，进行总诉苦，分果实，开展群众性检查算剥削账、翻身账。每个到会群众都记着想当年“凤凰双展翅，压迫穷人出不上气，金线吊葫芦，穷人血汗吸里头”。到看今天“凤凰头断葫芦开，穷人血汗倒出来”。今后是，“翻身不忘共产党，武装生产保卫好时光”。并提出“不留一个穷朋友，不让一户不翻身”，穷朋友一条心，不让地主钻了空”。经过这段填补运动，韩璧村彻底实现了耕者有其田，地主三户消灭了，一七户贫雇上升为新中农。目前该村各阶层人口土地占有表列如下：成分    户数    人口    土地      总产量      每人   每亩    每人
                                              均地   产量    均粮旧富农   6       41     117.6     180.96      2.69   1.54     4.1旧富中   4       17      90.9       90.9      5.34   1.00    5.36新富中  17       74     350.5     391.73      4.74   1.12    5.28新中农 142      388     2002.7   1905.46      5.17     91    4.91旧中农  42      106      488.2    586.48      4.59    1.2    5.53降中农  12       79      282.2    283.13      3.55    1.04   3.56
