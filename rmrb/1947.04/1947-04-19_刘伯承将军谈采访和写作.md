General Liu Bocheng on Interviewing and Writing
	·Qi Yu·
	I. Pen Nibs Should Carry Emotion

	"Literary works should use rich emotions, speak reasonably and logically, and be clear and methodical, so that people will be completely convinced and have nothing to criticize; that is a truly good work." He cited many of Tolstoy's works, which are rich in emotion, making them endlessly readable and naturally arousing the reader's sympathy. I remember when I was a child, reading *Dream of the Red Chamber*, I felt sad for days after Lin Daiyu's death. Reading *Romance of the Three Kingdoms*, I cried with grief when I read about Guan Gong's defeat at Maicheng and his subsequent death. It's truly "shedding tears for the ancients while reading *Three Kingdoms*." Why did it arouse my sympathy so much? This is mainly because the emotions in the work are so deeply moving. Liang Qichao said: "Pen nibs should always carry emotion." If we write military news reports, only writing about the course of the war and listing a bunch of figures for the results, without the author's emotion embedded in the content of the news report, this kind of news often feels dull and boring to read. If there is the author's emotion in it, writing about the atrocities of the Chiang army will inevitably arouse the enemy's hatred and common hatred among all the people in the liberated areas. The heroism of the soldiers will make people feel it is worth singing and weeping about. The article written by Comrade Masses about the Battle of Dayang Lake made Chairman Yang cry when he read it. The article written by Comrades Tianxiao and others about the Battle of Yangzhuang made a comrade in an organization in the Taihang area determined to work hard in the rear and seize the opportunity to support the front line. The main problem with these articles is that they are written with emotion, which evokes sympathy in the reader.
	II. News Reports Should Be Concise, Short, and Write About One Issue.

	"The article is not about length, but about focusing on one issue." General Liu cited Liang Qichao's articles, which are good at using the method of separation. That is, concentrate on writing about one issue, and write about a small issue, seeing a world from a grain of sand. He said: In 1944, a foreign reporter came to Yan'an and expressed his feelings, saying: "In the past, we thought the Communist Party was good at propaganda. Now it seems that your Communist Party is the least good at propaganda." It turned out that this reporter criticized the articles published in our liberated area newspapers for committing old eight-legged essays. Each article had to write about several issues, taking care of everything, and the center was not prominent, which made the article seem powerless in its propaganda effect. My habit is: whether reading newspapers or magazines, I always like to read the short ones first, and after reading all the short articles, I go to read the long ones. I think we are on the front line of the Patriotic Self-Defense War, and the work is so intense, writing long articles takes a lot of time, readers also take a lot of time to read, and broadcasting also takes a lot of electricity, and the opportunity to publish long articles is relatively small. If there are many issues, it is better to write them out separately several times, so that the issues we want to tell others are more easily accepted.
	III. What to Do, What to Learn

	One day, we listened to the broadcast from Yan'an. Handan issued a message that the Jilu Yu liberated thirteen county towns in twenty-six days, saying: "Our army straddled the Longhai Railway and attacked Xuzhou, so that the front line of the War of Patriotic Self-Defense was shortened by more than 100 kilometers." General Liu believed that the military term "shorten the front line" is mostly used for retreats, not for offensives, such as the so-called "shorten the front line in order to lure the enemy deep and annihilate the enemy." Why does this happen? Mainly because the person writing the news lacks military common sense. He advised each of our journalist comrades to learn all kinds of knowledge, seize the opportunity to learn the business anytime and anywhere. The comrades who follow the army for interviews must first study military theory and general military common sense.
	IV. In-depth Interviews and Handling Manuscripts, etc.

	One day, I wrote a war report, and General Liu criticized that the materials were neither substantial nor written deeply. He said, there are eight words you should remember firmly: "Seek refinement in material selection, seek density in conception." The meaning of these eight words, I think, is: in-depth investigation and research and how to intercept and handle manuscripts. For example, when writing about a hero, we should not only study how heroic this hero is from the front, but more importantly, we should interview the reason for his heroism, that is, to write out his thoughts. At the same time, look for the reflections on this hero from the characters around this hero. The so-called good flowers must have green leaves to accompany them. A single person will never become a hero. If we can reflect the deeds of a hero from the side, it will be more powerful than writing from the front. If we only write about the hero from the perspective of hibiscus flowers, then the hero we write about will inevitably be the same. We must write about the hero from various aspects, then the heroes will have different characteristics.

### 刘伯承将军谈采访和写作

　　刘伯承将军谈采访和写作
    ·齐语·
    一、笔尖带感情
    “文学作品，在于用丰富的情感，说的入情入理，头头是道，才能令人五体投地，无可非议；那才是真正的好作品。”他举出托尔斯泰的许多作品，感情丰富，使人百读不厌，自然而然引起了读者的同情。我想起在小的时候，读红楼梦，对林黛玉之死，心里难受了好几天，看三国演义读到关公走麦城最后被杀，难过得哭了，真所“看三国流泪替古人担忧”。为什么会那样引起我的同情呢？这主要是作品的感情感人之深。梁启超说：“笔尖常带感情。”我们写军事新闻通讯，如仅写战争的经过及其战果列上一大堆数目字，而没有作者的感情嵌在新闻通讯的内容里边，这种新闻往往令人看了感觉是枯燥无味，百读百厌，如有作者的感情在内，写蒋军的暴行，必然能引起全解放区人民的敌忾同仇，战士的英勇，才能使人感到可歌可泣。群众同志所写大杨湖之战，杨主席看了为之流泪，天晓等同志写的杨庄之战，使太行区一位机关同志看了要努力后方工作，抓紧支援前线，这些文章，主要问题，写的有感情，使人读了引起同情。
    二、新闻通讯要简练短小，写一个问题。
    “文章不在长，而在集中写一个问题。”刘将军举出梁启超的文章，善于用割离的办法。就是集中一个问题去写，而且写一个小的问题，从一粒沙子看一个世界，他说：一九四四年外国某记者到延安，发表感想说：“过去我们以为共产党善于宣传，现在看来，你们共产党最不会宣传。”原来这位记者批评我们解放区的报纸上刊登的文章，犯了老八股，每篇文章要写若干问题，面面要顾到，中心不突出，就显得文章在宣传作用上没有力量。我的习惯是：无论读报或者是读杂志，总喜欢先从短小的读，把所有短的文章读完后，才去读长的文章。我想我们处在爱国自卫战争的最前线，工作如此紧张，写长文章要费许多时间，读者也要费许多时间去读，在广播时还要费许多电力，而且长文章发表的机会也比较少，如问题多，不如分开几次把他写出，那样我们可要告诉别人的问题，比较更容易令人接受。
    三、做什么，学习什么
    有一天我们听延安的广播，邯郸发出冀鲁豫在二十六天内收复十三座县城消息内称：“我军横跨陇海、夹击徐州，使爱是自卫战争的战线，全面缩短百余公里。”刘将军认为缩短战线军事术语，多用于退却，而不用于进攻，例如所谓“缩短战线，以便诱敌深入，歼灭敌人。”为什么会出这个岔子，主要由于写新闻的人，对军事常识不足，他劝我们每个记者同志，对各种知识要传，随时随地抓紧机会学习业务，随军采访的同志，首先要学习军事理论及一般军事常识。
    四、深入采访及处理稿件等问题
    有一天我写的一个战报，刘将军批评材料既不充实，写的也不深刻，他说有八个字你牢牢记住：“取材求精，构思求密”。这八个字的意思，我想就是：深入调查研究及如何截裁处理稿件的问题，例如写一个英雄，我们不但要从正面研究这个英雄如何英勇，更主要的要采访他英勇的原因，就是写出他的思想。同时再从这个英雄周围的人物寻找对这个英雄的反映，所谓好花必需有绿叶陪衬，单独一个人决成个了英雄，如能从侧面去反映出一个英雄的事迹，则比正面写更为有力，如仅从表现芙蓉花写英雄，则所写的英雄必然千篇一律，要从各个侧面去写英雄，则英雄各有不同的特点。
