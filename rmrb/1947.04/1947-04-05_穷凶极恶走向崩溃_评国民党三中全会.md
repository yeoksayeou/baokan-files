　　Raving Mad Heading Towards Collapse
    ——A Commentary on the Kuomintang's Third Plenary Session
    The Kuomintang's Third Plenary Session, which just concluded, was convened at a time when the four families of Chiang, Kung, Soong, and Chen were facing the most serious crisis in their history. After reviewing the proceedings of this meeting, the Chinese people can strengthen their confidence and be assured that the day of democratic liberation of the motherland can arrive sooner. From this meeting, it can be clearly seen: First, how serious is the crisis of Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary rule; second, Chiang Kai-shek has no real way to overcome the crisis; third, Chiang Kai-shek has decided to use extremely vicious methods to save the crisis, which will inevitably deepen his crisis and accelerate his collapse.
    Chiang Kai-shek faces three major crises: military, economic, and political. The many documents passed by the Kuomintang's Third Plenary Session reflect these three aspects of the crisis. Lengthy resolutions and declarations were adopted for all three aspects, characterized by increasingly long articles and fewer and fewer solutions. In a secret meeting, Chiang Kai-shek called on the reactionaries to fight desperately, saying, "From now until September, it is a matter of life and death." This time, Chiang Kai-shek did not boast of "eliminating the CCP in half a year," but set another half year, a half year of life and death. But precisely at this meeting, what happened was not the unity of the reactionaries, but the infighting within them. The C.C. Clique and the Fuxing Clique attacked the Political Science Clique and the Kung and Soong families, and front-line generals Xue Yue, Wu Qihui, Li Yannian, etc., were replaced.
    Chiang Kai-shek's military crisis is extremely profound. If Chiang Kai-shek had advantages and initiative on all battlefields in July last year, then now he is at least at a complete disadvantage on the two battlefields of Hebei-Shandong-Henan and southern Shanxi; on the two battlefields of Hebei-Chahar-Jehol and the Northeast, he has begun to become disadvantaged; and on the Shandong battlefield, his forces are insufficient, so he still does not dare to enter Tai'an. What methods does Chiang Kai-shek use to deal with this crisis? First, it is to replace generals. Using Chen Cheng, Gu Zhutong, Tang Enbo, and other more loyal but also more incompetent lackeys to command the front line is very similar to Hitler replacing Brauchitsch. This obviously does not help, because the troop strength has not increased at all. Second, it is to divide the already insufficient forces to open up the Northwest battlefield, wanting to attack the CCP's leading organs, and to celebrate after the People's Liberation Army actively withdraws from Yan'an. This is very similar to Hitler attacking Stalingrad after failing to conquer Moscow. Chiang Kai-shek overestimated himself and launched a so-called five-way offensive against the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia and Shanxi-Suiyuan liberated areas, but in fact, the forces of four of the routes were too weak and could only serve as symbolic offensives. The main force, Hu Zongnan, only had seventeen brigades that entered the border area, and only fifteen brigades that entered Yan'an and its vicinity. After arriving in Yan'an, he had to use three or four brigades to defend Yan'an and its rear, and one brigade has already been annihilated. When he wants to advance further, on the one hand, he has to use more troops to defend, and on the other hand, he will inevitably be annihilated one after another. What can this little force accomplish? As for celebrating, it would be more appropriate to say mourning. Because from now on, Hu Zongnan's troops are sure to be completely annihilated in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia border area. Chiang Kai-shek's third way to save the military crisis is to block the Yellow River. Chiang Kai-shek and his master, American imperialism, both thought this was worth "forty divisions of troops." In addition to giving Hu Zongnan a "commendation" telegram, the Kuomintang's Third Plenary Session also gave a "commendation" telegram to the personnel who blocked the river, which shows how much they value this matter. However, regardless of how perfidious and harmful to the people Chiang Kai-shek's action is, Chiang Kai-shek's action shows that he no longer has the ability to attack the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan liberated area; and if the Yellow River is not defended by troops, it can never resist the People's Liberation Army.
    From this, it can be seen that Chiang Kai-shek's military crisis is already extremely profound, and Chiang Kai-shek has no real way to save this crisis. Chiang Kai-shek's adoption of methods such as replacing generals, attacking Yan'an, and blocking the Yellow River are extremely vicious methods, which will not only fail to save the crisis, but will inevitably accelerate and deepen the crisis.
    Chiang Kai-shek has always been the only person in China who does not admit that the Kuomintang has an economic crisis, but this time, the resolution of the Kuomintang's Third Plenary Session had to admit an unprecedentedly serious economic crisis. Chiang Kai-shek's guarantee to these lackeys is already different from the past, not the so-called "no economic crisis," but "the economy will never collapse." Chiang Kai-shek's ghost talk translated into human language is that the economy of the Chiang-controlled area is already collapsing. Precisely because of this, the Kuomintang's Third Plenary Session had to pass "plans" to "reform" the economy. The Kuomintang's plan is not to abolish bureaucratic capital, but to strengthen the four families' bureaucratic capital's control over the national economy, especially to expand its control to the countryside. Due to the infighting within the four banks and two companies, this "plan" specifically distributed their plundering range. Strengthening the control of bureaucratic capital and specifically distributing the plundering range is certainly not a real way to save the economic collapse, but a more extremely vicious plundering method, which will inevitably further aggravate the economic collapse and aggravate the infighting within the bureaucratic capital. There are two points in the Kuomintang's economic plan that are worth noting: one is to establish county banks in each county, in order to plunder the already bankrupt peasants more deeply, making them bankrupt faster and more thoroughly. This is learning from Yan Xishan's method in Shanxi, and the serious consequences it causes will be no different from Shanxi, that is, the accelerated collapse of reactionary rule. The second is that public school employees are changed to in-kind supply, which means that Chiang Kai-shek will only try to maintain the life of public school employees in the Beijing-Shanghai area who are not full or starving, and public school employees in other places will have to starve to death or find other ways themselves.
    Chiang Kai-shek's political crisis is caused by his three major policies of national betrayal, civil war, and dictatorship. If he wants to solve the political crisis, he must abolish the traitorous Sino-U.S. Commercial Treaty, abolish the pseudo-constitution, and restore the ceasefire agreement. In this regard, the Chinese people have given him many opportunities and a lot of time, doing their utmost, but at this Kuomintang Third Plenary Session, Chiang Kai-shek openly declared that a "political solution" is already "hopeless," and he will never be independent but will continue to betray the country, he will never want peace but will continue the civil war, and he will never want democracy but will continue the dictatorship. Not only that, but he will also intensify national betrayal, intensify the civil war, and strengthen the dictatorship. It is very clear that Chiang Kai-shek also wants to use extremely vicious methods to struggle through the political crisis he is encountering, and he never wants to make any slightest change.
    To summarize the Kuomintang's Third Plenary Session, the eight characters "raving mad, heading towards collapse" can exhaust it. This inauspicious situation is not only the case for Chiang Kai-shek, but also for Chiang Kai-shek's master, American imperialism. More than a year ago, this group of reactionaries was still deceiving and suppressing the people on the one hand; but since they cannot deceive or suppress them, they are anxious, so they simply expose their reactionary faces and want to maintain their rule by frightening the people. However, there is a difference between Chiang Kai-shek and his American master. If American imperialism still has hundreds of millions of U.S. dollars to use as capital for frightening people, then Chiang Kai-shek does not even have this capital; all Chiang Kai-shek has are a few "reform plans," that's all, nothing more.
    In fact, Chiang Kai-shek has no way out. His outward strength but inner weakness and his being deserted by his followers are becoming increasingly obvious. He is already in trouble now, and he will be in even more trouble in the future. His reactionary rule is on its last breath. This reactionary rule will inevitably collapse, and it may come quite quickly.

　　穷凶极恶走向崩溃
    ——评国民党三中全会
    刚才闭幕的国民党三中全会，是蒋、孔、宋、陈四大家族遇到了历史上最严重危机的时候召开的。看了这个会议的经过，中国人民可以加强信心，确信祖国民主解放的日子可以提早到来。从这次会议中，可以明白看到：第一、蒋介石反动统治的危机是如何严重；第二、蒋介石对于克服危机毫无真正的办法；第三、蒋介石决定以穷凶极恶的办法来挽救危机，结果势必加深其危机和加速其崩溃。
    蒋介石面前放着三个大危机，即军事危机、经济危机与政治危机。国民党三中全会通过的许多文件，反映了这三方面的危机。对于这三方面都通过了冗长的决议和宣言，其特点是文章越来越长，办法越来越少。蒋介石在秘密会议中，号召反动派一齐起来拚命，他说：“从现在起至九月，是或生或死的关头”。蒋介石这次不敢夸口“半年消灭中共”了，他定了另一个半年，或生或死的半年。但就在这次会议上，发生的事情不是反动派内部的团结，而是反动派内部的争吵。Ｃ·Ｃ系、复兴系攻击政学系与孔、宋系，前线将领薛岳、吴其伟、李延年等被撤换等等。
    蒋介石的军事危机是深重已极了，如果去年七月蒋介石在一切战场上都有优势和主动权，那末，现在至少在冀鲁豫和晋南两个战场上已处于完全的劣势；在晋察冀热与东北两个战场上已开始变为劣势；在山东战场上则兵力不足，以致至今不敢进泰安。蒋介石用什么办法来对付这个危机呢？第一、是撤换将领。用陈诚、顾祝同、汤恩伯等更忠心的也是更无能的走狗当前线指挥，这种情形与希特勒撤换勃鲁齐区极相类似，这样显然无补于事。因为兵力仍旧毫无增加。第二、是把已经不足的兵力，再分出来开辟西北战场，想来打击中共首脑机关，并在人民解放军主动撤出延安之后举行庆祝。这种情形与希特勒打不下莫斯科而改攻斯大林格勒又极相类似。蒋介石不自量力，对陕甘宁和晋西北解放区举行所谓五路进攻，其实其中四路兵力太单薄，只能作象征的进攻。主力胡宗南攻入边区的只有十七个旅，攻入延安及其附近的只有十五个旅，到了延安不得不将三、四个旅守备延安及其后路，一个旅已被歼灭，再要前进时，一方面是要用更多的兵去守备，另一方面又不可避免的将陆续被歼灭。这点兵力，那里打得出一个什么名堂？至于庆祝，那倒不如说吊孝更恰当。因为从此以后，胡宗南部是肯定要在陕甘宁边区里被歼灭干净的了。蒋介石挽救军事危机的第三个办法，就是黄河堵口。这一着蒋介石及其主子美国帝国主义都以为抵得“四十师大军”。国民党三中全会除了给胡宗南一个“嘉勉”电报外，也给堵口人员以一个“嘉勉”电，足见其重视此事。但是，姑且不论蒋介石的这一行动是如何背信弃义，残害人民。蒋介石的这一行动，表示他已经没有能力进攻晋冀鲁豫解放区；而且黄河如果没有兵守，是决不能抵御人民解放军的。
    由此可见，蒋介石的军事危机已经极其深重，蒋介石毫无真正的办法来挽救这个危机。蒋介石采用撤换将领，进攻延安，黄河堵口等项办法，是穷凶极恶的办法，不但不能挽救危机，反而必然加速和加深危机。
    蒋介石历来是中国境内不承认国民党有经济危机的独一无二的人，但这次国民党三中全会决议，却不得不承认空前严重的经济危机。蒋介石对这喽罗们保证的已经和过去不同，不是所谓“没有经济危机”，而是“经济决不会崩溃”。蒋介石这句鬼话翻译成人话，就是蒋管区的经济已在崩溃中。正因为如此，所以国民党三中全会才要通过“方案”来“改革”经济。国民党的方案不是取消官僚资本，而是加强四大家族官僚资本对全国的经济控制，特别是要扩展其统制到乡村中去。由于四银行、二公司内部互相倾轧，这一次的“方案”中具体分配了他们的劫掠范围。加强官僚资本的统制，并具体分配劫掠范围，那当然绝对不是挽救经济崩溃的真正办法，而是更加穷凶极恶的掠夺办法，因而必然更加加剧经济的崩溃和加剧官僚资本内部的互斗。国民党的经济方案中有两点值得注意：其一是要在各县设立县银行，以便更深一层的掠夺已经破产的农民，使其破产得更快、更彻底。这是学的山西阎锡山的办法，其所引起的严重后果，也与山西不会两样，即反动统治的加速崩溃。其二是公教人员改以实物供给，这就是说蒋介石将仅仅设法维持京、沪范围内的公教人员的吃不饱饿不死的生活，其他各地的公教人员只好让其饿死或者自己另想办法。
    蒋介石的政治危机，是由于他的卖国、内战、独裁三大政策所引起的，如果要想解决政治危机，必须取消卖国的中美商约，取消伪宪和恢复停战协定。在这方面，中国人民给了他很多机会和很多时间，做到了仁至义尽，此次国民党三中全会，蒋介石公开宣布“政治解决”已经“绝望”，决不要独立而要继续卖国，决不要和平而要继续内战，决不要民主而要继续独裁。不但如此而已，还要加紧卖国。加紧内战和加强独裁。很明白，蒋介石对于他所遇到的政治危机，也想用穷凶极恶的办法挣扎过去，而绝不想作任何一丝一毫的改变。
    总括国民党三中全会，“穷凶极恶，走向崩溃”八字可以尽之。这一不吉利的形势，不仅蒋介石是如此，蒋介石的主子美国帝国主义也是一样。这批反动派一年多以前，还是对于人民一面欺骗，一面镇压；但是，既然欺骗不了又镇压不了，于是就发急了，于是就索性把自己的反动面貌公开出来，而想以吓唬人民的办法来维持其统治。但是，蒋介石及其美国主子之间是有分别的，如果美国帝国主义还有几万万美金可以作吓人的资本，则蒋介石连这点本钱也后有；蒋介石所有的，只有几个“改革方案”，如此而已，一点也没有多的。
    实际上，蒋介石已经毫无办法了，他的外强中干、众叛亲离已经日益明显。他现在已经不得了，将来更不得了，他的反动统治已经奄奄一息，这个反动统治必然崩溃，而且可能来得颇快。
