(This report from our Jinnan office on the 19th) In Weixian County's Daning Village, land reform is being carried out alongside efforts to deliver manure and plow the land. More than 20 hectares of land have already been plowed. After the struggle against four landlords basically concluded in early February (Lunar calendar), the masses proposed: "We can't keep having meetings for four sessions a day anymore; we have to take care of production too." From then on, it was decided that people would engage in production in the morning and hold meetings in the afternoon, later increasing to two working sessions per day. Recently, as sorghum was about to be planted, the masses discussed and decided: male members would engage in production for three sessions a day, with meetings during afternoon breaks and at night, while female members would work and hold meetings together during the day. The day before a large meeting, a joint meeting of group leaders would be held, followed by group meetings or a large meeting the next day. The content and timing of discussions would be specified and communicated to the masses in advance, allowing them to deliberate while working, thinking carefully before discussing at the meeting, saving time and allowing for an extra working session. When solving problems, a large meeting would be held, resulting in one less working session. When distributing spoils, the masses said: "Distributing the fruits is no simple matter; let's have several days of intensive meetings." So the masses concentrated and held meetings for four sessions a day for four days. In the first round, 3,000 catties of grain, 2,800 catties of cotton, and more than 200 pieces of clothing and cloth were distributed. After three days of deliberation in between, during which they worked for three days, they then spent two full days distributing 324 pieces of furniture, with special consideration given to military dependents and poor peasants. The five oxen that were seized were first used to plow eight days of land for the Tian Er family, military dependents without oxen. Then, they plowed about 20 mu of land for 22 elderly, weak, orphaned, widowed, and poor peasant households without oxen. These five oxen plowed a total of three hectares and fifty or sixty mu, solving the difficulties of poor military dependents and poor peasants who lacked oxen. All male and female members are enthusiastically engaging in the mass movement, and so far, all of the village's more than 20 hectares of land have been plowed, earlier than last year. All 160,000 catties of manure have also been delivered to the fields.

(This report from our Jinnan office on the 19th) At the beginning of the month, a joint expanded meeting of county and district cadres in Pingxiang County specifically discussed and arranged a major review of emancipation combined with production, emphasizing that the mass movement should be combined with spring plowing so that farming season is not missed. When distributing fruits, first focus on distributing land, then houses, and finally spoils. In short, the major review of emancipation should be conducted in conjunction with production: (1) Digging Rivers: The first phase is after sowing and before weeding, digging and repairing the Liu River and Fuyang River. The second phase is after the wheat harvest and during the gaps between weeding, digging and repairing the Xiao Zhang River. (2) In the paddy field villages of the first, second, and fifth districts, canals are opened for irrigation during the day, and emancipation meetings are held at night. Women can work while attending meetings. (3) Adjusting livestock assistance to solve the problem of animal power shortages, with one animal equivalent to four workdays, and one person equivalent to one workday, at six catties of sorghum per workday. The government prints mutual aid agreements, guaranteeing that those who owe workdays will repay with grain in the fall. (4) Advocate for women's spinning and weaving, learning from the model women of Weizhuang Village, Li Bantong's mother and Cunlu's mother. These two formed a mutual aid group, engaging in both emancipation and production, weaving five bolts of military cloth in half a month. (5) In alkaline land villages such as Hongkang, five million catties of salt are produced annually, which can solve the difficulty of obtaining ten million catties of grain. During the major review, they hold meetings at night.

    【本报冀南十九日电】威县大宁村一面进行土地改革，一面送粪翻地，二十多顷地现已翻完。旧历二月初对四家地主的斗争基本上结束后，群众就提出：“以后可不能再一天四晌的开会了，也得照顾到生产”。从那时起，就规定了上午生产，下午开会，后来又增加到每日二晌作活。最近高粱要下种，群众又讨论决定：男会员一天生产三晌，午后休息时和夜间开会，女会员白天在一起做活开会。大会前一天，先开小组长联席会，第二天开小组会或者开大会，规定讨论内容和时间，事先告诉群众，一面做活，一面酝酿，想准了再在会上讨论，节省时间，可以多做一晌活，解决问题时开大会，就少做一晌活。分浮财时群众说：“分果实这可不简单，咱紧开他几天会。”于是群众聚精会神的又是一天四晌的开了四天会。第一批分了粮食三千斤，棉花二千八百斤和衣服布匹二百多件，中间又酝酿三天，即做了三天活，接着用了二整天，分了家具三百二十四件，并特别照顾了军属与贫农，把斗出来的五个牛，先给无牛军属天二家翻了八天地，其次替没牛的老弱孤寡和贫农二十二家翻了二十来亩地，这五头牛先后共翻了三顷五六十亩地，解决了没牛的贫军属和贫农的困难。全体男女会员在红火的闹着群运，到现在全村二十多顷田已全部翻过，比去年还早。十六万斤粪也全部送到地里。
    【本报冀南十九日电】平乡在月初县区干部扩大联席会上，具体讨论布置了翻身大检查结合生产，强调提出群运结合春耕，不误农时。分果实时先抓紧分配土地，然后分房，最后分浮财。总之，翻身大检查就结合生产进行：（一）挖河：第一期为播种后、锄苗前，挖修刘河、滏阳河。第二期为麦收后及锄苗一遍的空隙间，挖修小漳河。（二）一、二、五区水田村，白天开渠浇水，晚上开翻身会，妇女可一面开会一面做活。（三）调剂牲口互助，解决畜力困难，一个牲口顶四工，一人顶一工，每工六斤高粱，政府印互助文约，保证秋后欠工者以粮还工。（四）提倡妇女纺织，向魏庄模范妇女李扳通娘、存禄的娘学习。她二人组成互助，一面翻身，一面生产，半月织军布五匹。（五）红康等碱地村，每年产盐五百万斤，可解决一千万斤粮食困难，大检查中他们晚上开会。
