Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 12th: Comprehensive reports: The elections for prefectural and city mayors and local administrative personnel held in Japan on the 5th of this month were conducted under MacArthur's support and Yoshida's control. 38.4 percent of voters abstained, and many deliberately cast invalid ballots, sarcastically writing MacArthur or US Eighth Army Commander Eichel on the ballots to express their passive resistance. The recent local elections in Japan have aroused comments from various parties. The Washington Early Post commented: During the election process, the occupation authorities unilaterally supported the Yoshida government. In fact, this election merely allowed those officials who were previously approved by the occupation authorities and appointed by the Yoshida government to hold important government positions to obtain recognition from national institutions in addition to MacArthur's approval. The New York Herald Tribune also pointed out: Most of the elected officials are indeed the same type of people as the officials before the Pearl Harbor incident. It is unwise to believe that this change in the form of government guarantees that this Eastern oligarchy will become democratic.

　　麦克阿瑟支持吉田
    包办日本地方选举
    【新华社陕北十二日电】综合报导：本月五日日本举行之县市长及地方行政人员选举，是在麦克阿瑟支持吉田包办下进行的，有百分之三十八点四的选民放弃投票权，很多人故意投无效票，在票上讽刺地写麦克阿瑟或美第八军军长艾契尔等，以表示他们的消极抵抗。日本此次地方选举已引起各方评论，华盛顿早报评称：在竞选过程中，占领军当局一手支持着吉田政权，事实上此次选举仅仅使那些前由占领军当局批准由吉田政权任命居政府要职的官员，于麦克阿瑟之认许外，又获得国家机构之认许而已。纽约前锋论坛报并指出：大部分当选之官吏，确与珍珠港事变前之官吏为同类人物，如认此政府形式的变更，即保证为此东方之寡政治变为民主，实乃不智。
