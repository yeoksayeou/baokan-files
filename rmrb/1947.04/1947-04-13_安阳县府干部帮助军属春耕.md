　　Anyang County Government Cadres Help Military Families with Spring Planting
　　[This newspaper, Anyang News] To solve the spring planting difficulties of widowed and orphaned military families residing in villages, cadres from various sections of the county government organized themselves into small teams to help military families with farm work. They have already built thirteen earthen ridges, ten small dikes, and one embankment, and carried thirty loads of manure to the fields. In Lushan Village, a 63-year-old woman (a military family member) was very happy to see the government helping her with farm work. She bought a pack of cigarettes and said, "Comrades, you've worked hard, have a cigarette!" The comrades explained, "We don't smoke." Before they finished speaking, the old woman continued, "Now this democratic government is truly one family with the common people. It has liberated us and is even helping us with farm work. In the past, when the stubborn county government was in power, don't even mention planting land for the common people, they (referring to the stubborn government) would glare at us poor people. Both of my children have joined the Eighth Route Army. I must write them a letter and tell them not to worry about things at home, and to fight well on the front lines, kill more stubborn troops, and protect this good time for us." (Cheng Jun)

　　安阳县府干部帮助军属春耕
    【本报安阳讯】为了解决驻村孤寡军属春耕困难，县府各科干部组织成小队，给军属作活。现已培了十三条土＠，十块小地堰，垒岸一个，往地里担粪三十担。鹿山村有一位六十三岁的老太太（军属），看到政府给她作活，非常高兴，便买了一盒纸烟说：“同志们，辛苦了，吸盒烟吧！”同志们解释说：“我们不吸烟。”话头还未落了，老太太便又说起来了：“如今这民主政府真是和老百姓一家人，叫俺翻了身，还要给作活。从前顽固县政府在时，别说给老百姓种地啦，人家（指顽固政府）看见咱这穷人就红了眼（看不起意思），俺家两个孩子都参加了八路军，俺一定要给他写封信，不让他挂念家里事，叫他在前线好好打仗，多打死两个顽固军队，保住咱这好时光。”（成俊）
