Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 10th - The Chiang Kai-shek 11th Army, which invaded Tai'an city, triggered landmines planted in advance by our local armed forces and militia explosive teams at the city's railway station, East Gate, South Gate, and county government on the 31st of last month. In just half a day, more than 200 enemy soldiers, including a battalion commander, were killed or wounded. Three days after the Chiang army entered the city, the sound of landmine explosions continued to be heard. After the People's Liberation Army proactively withdrew from the city, the invading Chiang army was trapped in a difficult situation.

　　泰安满城地雷
    半天毙敌二百
    【新华社山东十日电】侵入泰安城之蒋十一军，于上月三十一日在该城车站、东关、南关、县政府到处踏响我地方武装及民兵爆炸队预埋之地雷，仅半天中即毙伤营长以下二百余名。蒋军进城三日后，地雷爆炸声犹不断传出。人民解放军主动撤离该城后，侵入之蒋军已陷入困境。
