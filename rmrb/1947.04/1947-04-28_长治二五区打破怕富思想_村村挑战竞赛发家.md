Changzhi News: The Second District, in order to comprehensively launch this year's large-scale production campaign, convened a mobilization meeting on April 16 with 1,216 people of all kinds. There were 654 turned-over heroes and labor heroes and active cadres, 424 former middle peasants, and 138 lazy people who liked to eat but did not work. After the mobilization meeting, discussions were conducted in groups, and muddled ideas of wanting to get rich but being afraid to get rich were discovered. Middle peasants believed that if the corn was cut, the beans would be exposed, and if the landlords were struggled against, it would be their turn. Struggle was the door to getting rich. Some lazy people ate and drank heavily, making the ditches never able to be filled. Therefore, some people believed that the Eighth Route Army loved poor people and would keep filling them. It was believed that if you got rich, you would have to fill the ditches again. Some even wanted to rely on struggle to eat, saying that the Eighth Route Army would not let anyone starve to death. In order to solve the above-mentioned confused ideas, each group discussed who was implementing leveling and making up for deficiencies in the past winter and spring? Why struggle against them? Did it struggle against our middle peasants? Yang Dongfa, a middle peasant from Jiaojiazhuang, said: "Our village struggled against ten landlord households and three local bullies. These people all lived by exploitation, so who else should we struggle against?" Song Sheng from Sudan said: "Our village did not struggle against two rich peasant households who started by working hard, and the two middle peasant households who were detained were also released. I don't think we will struggle against middle peasants." Discussing this issue made everyone clearly realize that those who were struggled against were feudal landlords and local bullies, not whoever was rich. Dong Sanzhi from Dongjia Village said: "I really regret not picking up manure in the winter of this year." They also discussed whether production after the turn-over would develop together. Would the Communist Party and Chairman Mao lead us to be rich or poor? Niu Honghai said: "Our production after the turn-over can never develop in a uniform way. The Eight Immortals cross the sea, each showing their unique abilities. You need whatever skills you have." Jia Danzhi from Wangdong Village said: "Leveling and making up for deficiencies, the lazy people don't move, wasting the fruits of struggle. It's always a ditch, always filling it for him. The Communist Party will never do that." Su Sanhao said: "The Communist Party led us to turn over, and will also lead production." In this discussion, Cao Tianfa, a lazy man from Gaohe Village, was moved to reflect. He said: "I used to smoke opium and drained my family. After liberation, I raised some opinions in the struggle and raised my fist, and I got five dan of rice. I felt that the grain came very easily, so I drank and ate noodles every day without working. I realized that this was wrong after these two days of meetings. Moreover, the reputation of hooligans and lazy people is not good. I am determined not to be a lazy person. I will go back and mobilize all those people like me to move, and also organize mutual aid teams." After discussion, after the thinking of the middle peasants was cleared, some of them wanted to actively produce when they went back, and some regretted not producing well in the past. For example, Guo Guizhi, a middle peasant from Gaohe Village, said: "After discussion, I am not afraid of struggle anymore. I will go back and produce well and persuade others." Another example is Peng Haifu from Pengjia Village, said: "Because I was afraid of struggle, I didn't sell coal all winter, waiting for struggle, losing at least twenty dan of rice. Now I really regret it." After continuous discussion, the obstacles to getting rich were broken, and everyone's enthusiasm for production and getting rich was very high. Then, the large-scale production work was arranged. This year, agriculture should be the main focus, combining agricultural and sideline industries and handicrafts throughout the year. A textile movement should be launched, and everyone should generally be able to achieve "cultivating three and having a surplus of one." The land should generally be plowed, raked, and harrowed once, and hoed twice. All labor should be organized to participate in large-scale production, and large-scale double work should be organized in the front and rear to overcome labor difficulties. After discussion, under the slogan of "Everyone make contributions and strive to be a hero," each village launched challenges and competitions. Bi Eryun, a labor hero from Sudan, said: "Our village is determined to challenge Tianhe Village. Our village will apply fifteen carts of manure per mu (equivalent to eighty dan), plow, rake, and harrow once, hoe three times, and increase the yield by three dou per mu. We will plant 700 mu of Golden Queen and 500 mu of Little Blue, increasing it by half compared to last year, and guarantee to achieve cultivating two and having a surplus of one. If we lose, the two instrumental bands will send two big flags to Tianhe." Cao Linshui, a turned-over hero from Tianhe, stood up and responded. He said that the labor force of the whole village would be organized to participate in the war in the front. One person would replace one person, and one work would be exchanged for one work. The labor force of the whole village would be graded according to strength, and the difference would be made up according to branch. Both participation in the war and production should not be neglected. The land should be plowed, raked, and harrowed once, and hoed twice. Fifteen carts of fertilizer should be applied per mu, and the yield should be increased by two dou and five sheng per mu. One hundred mu of cotton and two hundred mu of Golden Queen should be planted to achieve cultivating three and having a surplus of one. Nandong Village is good at textiles, and the women in our village will also challenge Nandong. If we lose, the two instrumental bands will send two big flags. The chairman of the Farmers' Association of Jiaojiazhuang challenged Tianhe and Sudan, applying fifteen carts of fertilizer per mu, plowing, raking, and harrowing once, and hoeing three times; the village opened a soybean oil mill, with each household investing shares, and the dividends and soybean cakes were divided, amounting to twenty-five jin per mu, increasing the yield by two dou per mu; the village opened a rolling mill, grinding flour to earn money, which could be used for the whole village to eat salt, burn coal, and other pocket money. Women's textiles will ensure that they don't buy cloth, so our village can achieve cultivating two and having a surplus of one. If we lose, we will send two seeders to the two villages. The challenge wave was filled with slogans such as "If you want to turn over completely, production is the root of wealth" and "Labor to get rich is the most glorious." (Changzhi County Second District Backbone Communication Group)

[Another News] More than 800 village cadres and activists in the Fifth District of Changzhi also discovered many confused ideas of not daring to produce and get rich at the production mobilization meeting on the 17th. The leaders immediately explained the policy to everyone. In the past, the struggle was against feudal landlords, not against getting rich. As long as you work hard to get rich, not only will you not be struggled against, but you will also be rewarded. This is the last time to level and make up for deficiencies. Everyone should work hard. It is most glorious to get rich through work. Cadres should make contributions on the production front, and working together with everyone can lead to production and getting rich. The slogans "If you want to turn over completely, you have to establish the root of wealth through production. In the past, we struggled against feudalism and local bullies, and we will never be afraid to get rich through labor"; "It is most glorious to get rich through labor, not to be a parasitic landlord. Cadres take turns on duty, and cultivating three and having a surplus of one must be implemented." Only then did everyone break through their concerns and become excited. Then, at the conference, villages challenged each other to compete, and village cadres made plans to get rich, and cadres competed to make contributions.

　　长治二五区打破怕富思想
    村村挑战竞赛发家
    【本报长治讯】二区为全面开展今年的大生产运动，于四月十六日召开一千二百十六人的各种各样人物动员大会，有翻身英雄劳动英雄，有干部积极分子六百五十四人，有旧中农四百二十四人，有好吃不动的懒汉一百卅八人。经大会动员后，分组展开讨论，发现了愿发财不敢发财的糊涂思想，中农认为割了玉茭露出豆，斗了地主就轮着自己，斗争就是门富。有些懒汉大吃大喝，使圪道永填不起来，因此有人认为八路军爱穷人，要一直填哩，准发大了就要填圪道哩。有些甚至想靠吃斗争，说八路军不让饿死人。为了解决上面几种糊涂思想，各组又讨论去冬今春实行填平补齐斗争的是什么人？为什么要斗他，斗争着咱中农没有？焦家庄中农杨董法说：“我村斗了十户地主，三户恶霸。这些人都是靠剥削过活，不斗争他斗谁？”苏店宋胜则说：“我村有两户劳动起家的富农没斗争，扣着两户中农也放啦，我看决不会斗争中农。”讨论这个问题，使大家明确认识了斗争的是封建地主恶霸，不是谁富就斗谁。东贾村董三只说：“年时冬没拾粪想起来真后悔。”又讨论翻身后生产是不是一齐往前发展。共产党毛主席领导咱富呢还是穷哩？牛红孩说：“咱翻身后生产永不能一律律的往前发展，八仙过海，各显其能，有什么本事要什么本事。”王董村贾旦只说：“填平补齐，懒汉不动，浪费了斗争果实，一直是圪道，一直给他填，共产党决不会这样办。”苏三好说：“共产党领导咱翻了身，还要领导生产哩。”在这样讨论下，把高河村懒汉曹天法感动的作了反省，他说：“我早先吸大烟，把家吸干啦，解放后开展斗争，我提了提意见，举了举拳头就得了五石米，觉着粮食来的很容易，就天天喝酒吃面不劳动。我开了这两天会，才知道这不对。况且流氓懒汉名誉也不好听，我下决心不当懒汉，回去动员我那一号人都要动，还要组织互助组。”经讨论，中农的思想打通后，有一部分回去要积极生产，有一部分想起过去不好好生产很后悔。如高河村中农郭贵只说：“我经过讨论不怕斗啦，回去要好好生产，解劝别人。”又如彭家村彭海富说：“因怕斗争，一冬天没卖煤，等着斗争，少赚廿多石米，现在想起来真后悔。”经连续讨论，打破了发家障碍，大家要求生产发家的劲头很大。接着布置大生产工作，今年要以农业为主，农副业手工业结合贯彻全年，展开纺织运动，普遍能达到耕三余一，地要普遍犁耢耙一次，锄二次，组织所有的劳力参加大生产，组织前后方大双工，克服劳力困难。讨论后，在“人人立功争取当英雄”的口号下，各村掀起挑战竞赛。苏店劳动英雄毕二云说：“我村决向天河村挑战，我村每亩地要上十五车粪（合八十担），犁耢耙一次，锄三次，每亩增加三斗产量，要种七百亩金皇后，五百亩小蓝，比去年增加一半，保证达到耕二余一，要输了，两伙八音会给天河送两杆大旗。”天河翻身英雄曹林水起立应战，他说要把全村劳畜力组织起来，去前方参战一个人顶一个人，一工换一工，全村劳畜力按强弱评分，按分支差，作到参战生产两不误，地要犁耢耙一次，锄二次，每亩上肥十五车，每亩增产二斗五升，要种一百亩棉花，二百亩金皇后，达到耕三余一，南董村纺织好，我村妇女还要向南董挑战，如输了，二杆大旗八音会送去。焦家庄农会主席向天河苏店挑战，每亩上十五车肥，犁耢耙一次，锄三次；村里开着一座豆油场，每户入股，分红分豆饼每亩合二十五斤，每亩增产二斗；坊村里开着罗工厂，磨粉赚下钱可供全村吃盐、烧煤等零花，妇女纺织保证不买布，这样我村能达到耕二余一。要输了，给他两村送两张耧。挑战浪潮中充满了，“要想翻透身，生产安富根”，“劳动发家最光荣”的口号。（长治县二区骨干通讯小组）
    【另讯】长治五区八百多村干部积极分子于十七日生产动员会上亦发现很多不敢生产发家的糊涂思想。领导上即向大家说明政策，过去斗争的是封建地主，并不是斗富，只要劳动发家，不但不斗，还要受到奖励。这是最后一次填平补齐，大家要好好劳动，劳动发家最光荣，干部要在生产战线上立功，和大家一起劳动就能生产发家。并提出口号“要想彻底翻透身，还得生产安富根，过去斗争封建和恶霸，劳动发家永不怕”；“劳动发家最光荣，不当地主寄生虫，干部轮流来值班，耕三余一定实行。”大家才打破顾虑兴奋起来，接着大会上各村挑战竞赛，各村干部订了发家计划，干部争着立功。（杏珍、生秀、开弟、殿康、银珠、令意）
