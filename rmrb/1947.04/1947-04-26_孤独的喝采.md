　　Lonely Applause
    After Chiang Kai-shek announced that he would "reorganize the government," before the Chinese reactionaries had time to praise it, several American reactionaries rushed to praise it first. American imperialists were so eager for the Kuomintang's "reorganized government" that they didn't even bother to cover up the ugly state of being the puppet show's backstage wire-puller. The American imperialists knew that no one among the Chinese people would applaud this "reorganization" farce that they directed, and they hoped that Americans would follow them and cheer a few times to help the scene. However, according to American reactionary Congressman Judd's statement to the Central News Agency reporter on the 19th, "Unfortunately, only a few people currently observe the importance of this reorganization." The play performed with great sweat by the American reactionaries and the Chiang Kai-shek group was not appreciated even in the United States. Only a few lonely American reactionaries shouted themselves hoarse, patting themselves on the back. The reactionaries are extremely unlucky!

　　孤独的喝采
    蒋介石宣布要“改组政府”后，中国的反动派还没有来得及称赞，美国的几个反动派就连忙抢先加以称赞。美国帝国主义者对于国民党的“改组政府”如此急色，竟顾不得遮盖一下傀儡戏后台牵线人的丑态。美国帝国主义者，明知他所导演的这出“改组”把戏，在中国人民中没有人加以喝采，他们希望美国人跟着他们喝几声采，帮帮场面。可是，据美国反动派众议员楚德十九日对中央社记者说：“所不幸者，即目前仅有少数人士观察此次改组之重要性。”美国反动派与蒋介石集团满头大汗演出的戏，竟然在美国也无人赏识，只有孤零零的几个美国反动派声嘶力竭，自己替自己捧场。反动派真是倒霉之极！
