　　Dong Hong Seizes Time to Participate in War and Does Not Neglect Production
    Shen Kaoze Group Plants Early
    Yang Gao Labor Hero Leads the Way in Hoeing 11 Hectares of Wheat in Four Days
    [Our Newspaper's Dispatch] The Shen Kaoze mutual aid group in the Dong Hong Village, Fourth District of Pingshun, consists of five households, with three full laborers and two half laborers. They have 48 mu of flat land and 33 mu of sloping land, totaling 81 mu. This group has a lot of land but few laborers. This time, the war participation support team was going to draw three full laborers from their group. This made it even harder to keep up. Those preparing to participate in the war just waited at home for the attack and did not go to the fields. They felt that production was impossible to carry out. Seeing this situation, Shen Kaoze convened a meeting of the whole group on the night of the 3rd day of the second lunar month to discuss planting the millet fields early. He said, "We have to plant some millet seeds before we participate in the war. If you leave behind these two old men, what use will they be? They can't plant so much land even if they work day and night. Let's hire people to plant, but every family has land, and everyone is busy. Even if we had rice, who would be willing to work for it? Wouldn't you be delaying the planting when you come back?" Using this method to get through to the group members, everyone said together, "Okay, let's do it tomorrow." Then they discussed the plan. First, they would scatter millet on the sloping land. Two half-laborer old men would pick up stones, and three full laborers would scatter seeds. Starting on the 4th, they completed 20 mu of millet on the sloping land in six days by the 10th. Starting on the 11th, they planted on the flat land. Two full laborers and one half-laborer were in charge of clearing the banks, and one full laborer and one half-laborer paired with two old oxen to manage the plowing and planting. They had already planted 4 mu of millet in two days. During this process, the group members saw that there was a solution, and they were very energetic, getting up early and working late without taking a midday nap, striving to complete all 8 mu of flat land by the 18th for millet planting. Then they prepared the cornfields. Under the influence of their group, other groups had already started to take action.
    [Another Dispatch] Because a group of laborers left Yang Gao Village, Fourth District of Pingshun to participate in the war, the masses were worried and felt there was a lack of labor. On the 28th of last month, labor hero Yang Yonggao held a meeting for everyone and raised the question of who the war participation was for, arousing everyone's speeches. Wang Anjin said, "The youth are going to the front to participate in the war to protect us. We should work hard in the rear. I am 55 years old this year, and I am not too old for labor." Chang Yuquan said, "The front has been fighting all the time, it doesn't count if we don't labor!" Liu Yongsheng said, "We are not afraid of the lack of labor, as long as we work patiently, even ants can move mountains." What the old men said influenced the young adults, and they all said it wouldn't work if they didn't work. They immediately arranged their lives and decided to hoe the wheat first. In order to improve technology, a technical committee was convened at night, and each team of the three mutual aid brigades selected a hoeing teacher. The next morning, the six best teachers hoed the standards on the edge of the village, and nineteen experts led the teams to work, their slogan being "Focus on quality, not speed." From the 1st to the morning of the 4th, it was summed up that a total of 147 full and half laborers participated, and 842.4 mu of wheat had been hoeed. There were still 317 mu left, which was completed in one day on the 4th. After hoeing, the technical committee also carried out inspections. The elderly were particularly enthusiastic about this hoeing, and they all reflected that this hoeing was very good. It can remove weeds and good seedlings, and the wheat is full, and each mu can produce one more dou. Some said, "We can harvest an extra 120 shi from hoeing these four days of wheat." Because they hoeed for the families of those participating in the war first, the families were particularly happy.

　　东洪争取时间参战不误生产
    申考则组提前下种
    阳高劳英带头四天锄麦十一顷
    【本报讯】平顺四区东洪村翻身英雄申考则互助组，有五户，全劳力三个，半劳力两个，平地四十八亩，坡地三十三亩，共计八十一亩。这组地多劳力少，可是这次参战担架又准备抽他组全劳力三个，这样一来更加赶不上了，准备参战的人，光在家等出击，也不上地，生产感到无法搞了。申考则看见这种情形，在阴历后二月三日夜，召开全组会议，讨论谷地提前下种，他说：“咱要在未参战以前把谷地下一部种籽，如果你们走后光丢下这两个老汉子顶什么用呢，就是黑明白日受也种不了这么多的地，用人来种吧，可是家家有地，人人忙呀，咱就有米吧谁赶上赚？你们回来不是就误了种拉吗？”用这种办法来打通组员思想，大家一齐说：“行，咱明天就干。”接着就讨论了计划，先往坡地撒谷，两个半劳力老汉拾石头，三个全劳力撒，于四日开始，到十日，六天内完成坡地二十亩谷，十一日开始往平地下种，两个全劳力一个半劳力在头收拾边岸，一个全劳力和一个半劳力配两头老牛管犁种。两天内已种四亩谷，在这当中，组员看见有了办法，劲头很大，搭黑起早不睡午觉，争取八亩平地到十八日全部完成种谷，接着收拾玉茭地，在他组影响下，其他组已开始动手。
    【又讯】平顺四区阳高村因参战走了一批劳力，在群众思想上都发了愁，感到劳力缺乏。劳动英雄杨永高就于上月二十八日给大家开会，提出了参战为谁，激起了大家的发言，王安金说：“青年到前方参战，是为了保卫咱，咱在后方应该努力生产，我今年五十五岁，对劳动还不服老呢”。常玉全说：“前方一直打仗，咱不劳动还算话！”刘永盛说：“咱不怕劳力缺，只要耐心干，就是蚂蚁也能搬倒山。”老汉们这样一说，把青壮年都影响起来，都说这不干还行，当场就安排了生活，决定先锄麦子。为了提高技术，黑夜召开了技术委员会，三个互助大队，每组都选上锄苗教师。第二天早上，由六个最好的老师在村边锄下了标准，十九个能手领导各组干起来，他们的口号是“图好不图快”。从一日到四日早上，总结了一下，全半劳力共参加一百四十七人，已锄麦八百四十二亩四分，还留三百一十七亩，四日一天就完成了。锄完后，技术委员会还进行检查。这次锄麦，一般老年人特别起劲，都反映这次锄麦很好，能除草好捉苗，麦子饱满，每亩能多收一斗。有的说：“咱锄这四天麦子，能多收一百二十石。”因为先给抗属锄，抗属特别高兴。
