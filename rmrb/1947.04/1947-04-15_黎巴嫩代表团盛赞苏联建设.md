Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, April 8th: TASS, Beirut: Beirut's "Oriental Daily" has continuously published the impressions of the Lebanese delegation that recently visited the Soviet Union. A reporter asked: "It is said that the Soviet Union is surrounded by an Iron Curtain. Have you noticed this Iron Curtain?" Delegation member Raif Hanri replied: "Yes, I noticed that there are great forces creating this Iron Curtain to isolate the Soviet Union from the outside world. But I also noticed that it is not the Soviet Union that is creating this Iron Curtain, but the outside world. For example, several telegrams we sent from Iran to our friends in Beirut informing them of our return date and the warm reception we received in the Soviet Union were either not sent at all or were greatly delayed." Raif Hanri also said: "The Soviets frankly and patiently answered all the questions we raised. They sincerely desire to establish close and friendly cultural ties with the outside world. In every city, we observed everything that most interested us. I love the Soviet Union; but in the past, we only understood it through books; I was also afraid of disappointment about the visit to the Soviet Union; but now, I excitedly and happily say: 'The reality truly exceeded all my best expectations.'" Raif Hanri then detailed the cultural development of the Soviet Union. Delegation member Henri Riyad Fayyad Elain talked about the great concern of the Soviet government for happiness, and the active participation of women in domestic political life. Subsequently, he detailed the development and revival of the Soviet national economy, as well as the reconstruction of cities and the broad opportunities for working people to develop their culture.

　　黎巴嫩代表团盛赞苏联建设
    【新华社陕北八日电】塔斯社贝鲁特讯：贝鲁特东方报顷连续发表了最近访苏的黎巴嫩代表团的访苏观感。记者问：“据说苏联是被铁幕包围着，你曾注意到这层铁幕否？”团员雷夫汉里答：“是的，我曾注意到有很大的力量制造了这一铁幕，使苏联与外面世界隔绝。但我又注意到制造这层铁幕的，不是苏联而是外面世界。例如我们从伊朗发向贝鲁特的朋友告知我们返国日期及在苏联受到热烈招待之情形的几个电报，不是全未发出，即被大大延误。”雷夫汉里又谓：“苏联人坦率地耐心地回答了我们所提出的一切问题。他们诚心渴望与外面世界建立密切而友谊的文化连系。在每一城市，我们观察了自己所最感兴趣的一切。我喜爱苏联；但过去，我们是仅凭书本去了解她的；对于访苏之行，我亦曾恐失望；然而现在，我激动快乐的说：“真的现实超过了我一切最好的期待。”雷夫汉里接着详述了苏联的文化发展情形。团员安里利阿·费亚司·意累亨谈到苏联政府对于幸福所表示的重大关切，及妇女在国内政治生活中的积极活动。随后又详述了苏联国民经济的发展与复兴，以及都市的重建和劳动人民发展文化的广泛机会。
