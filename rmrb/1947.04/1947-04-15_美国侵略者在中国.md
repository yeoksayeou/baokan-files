　　American Aggressors in China
　　Su· Alexander Kogan
　　The current Sino-American relations are not only a matter of peace in the Pacific, but also a threat to world peace. In the current Chinese civil war, American weapons are being used extensively against the Chinese people. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, Japanese imperialists used Kuomintang reactionaries to make Chinese fight Chinese. At that time, Chinese patriots and friends of China were heartbroken by this. At that time, approximately 800,000 Kuomintang troops defected to Japan. In addition, there were Kuomintang troops who never fought against the Japanese but stubbornly helped the Japanese army fight against the New Fourth Army, the Eighth Route Army, and other people's revolutionary armies of China. The situation in China today is almost the same as it was then, only on a larger scale. More than two million Kuomintang troops are attacking the People's Revolutionary Army for the benefit of the American and Chinese reactionaries. The Americans have concentrated one-sixth of their navy in Chinese waters and have established special Marine Corps in China. According to official announcements, the Marine Corps has a force of only 22,500 men, while unofficial estimates put it at 80,000 men. They have "transferred" to Chiang Kai-shek approximately 1,000 of the latest bombers, as well as a large number of military motorcycles, various weapons, and a huge amount of "surplus materials."
　　The Japanese army once claimed that it only wanted to protect the important transportation lines in North China, but today the American troops in North China have the same mission. They are enthusiastically shooting down Chinese farmers working in the fields, and they are fighting against the Chinese People's Army. Some people believe that the only way to occupy other countries is to invade with a large army, establish one's own government, and rule as brutally as the Japanese imperialists in China or the Germans in various European countries, just like the fascists of the past. This is an extreme form of aggression. However, do not forget that at one time, Japanese imperialists dreamed of capturing China with their infamous Twenty-One Demands. Also, remember that the then Chinese dictator Yuan Shikai declared that he was determined to accept these conditions. If it were not for the protests of the Chinese people and many other reasons, Japan would undoubtedly have become the master of China without unsightly military aggression. If we carefully analyze the current Sino-American relations from the aid-to-China bill passed by the U.S. Congress, we can see that it is not much different from the Twenty-One Demands listed by Japan. At that time, Japan demanded that China's army and navy must hire Japanese instructors, which China finally refused to accept; but today, the Americans have forcibly sent their military instructors to the Chinese. In addition, they have even forcibly sent the Chinese entire army units and entire naval fleets, all of whom are their officers and personnel. The Kuomintang reactionaries have agreed to all of this without hesitation.
　　In the past, Japan demanded that their goods exported to China and their investments in Chinese industries, banks, railways, transportation, trade and other enterprises should enjoy the most preferential treatment. However, due to the firm resistance of the Chinese people's areas in the form of guerrilla warfare and boycotts of Japanese goods, they did not fully achieve their goals even in the Chinese territory they occupied, although Kuomintang officials often helped them by promoting Japanese goods to the interior. Today, under the protection of their own army and the Kuomintang army, the Americans have become the undisputed masters of the Chinese market. The "crystal palace of Chinese industrialization" has not yet been built, but the Americans have already destroyed China's national industry, causing millions of small Chinese manufacturers and merchants to go bankrupt and close down. Writing this, it is worth mentioning the statement broadcast by Mr. Vincent, Director of the Far Eastern Division of the U.S. State Department, on October 20th last year, in which he said that the U.S. policy is to support U.S. business activities in China and accelerate their recovery. They are trying to get representatives of commercial companies back to China for their own benefit. He said he intends to let them return to Shanghai, Hong Kong, Tianjin and other ports as quickly as possible. American church organizations are equally frank.
　　Under the current circumstances, every move has consequences for tens of millions of Chinese people. For example, why did 1,500 industrial factories in the Kuomintang-controlled areas of China, which used to support about two million workers and their families, go bankrupt in the past six months? That is because American imports pay very low import taxes, or even no taxes at all, making Chinese enterprises unprofitable and unable to compete with American manufacturers exporting to China. Then, why doesn't the Chiang Kai-shek government fight against the disasters of its own national industry? That is because American monopoly capitalists are frantically helping this government to suppress the Chinese people and deprive China of its independence. (Reprinted from the Liberation Daily)

　　美国侵略者在中国
    苏·阿历山大·柯干
    目前的中美关系，不仅是太平洋和平的问题，而且是全世界和平的威胁。在目前中国的内战中，美国武器被大量的用来对付中国人。在抗日战争期间，日本帝国主义者曾利用国民党反动分子，使中国人打中国人。早在当时，中国的爱国人士和中国的友人便曾因此而痛心疾首。当时曾有约计八十万人的国民党军队投效日本，此外，国民党军队中又有从未对日作战而却固执地帮助日军打新四军、八路军和中国其他人民革命军的军队。中国今天的情况和那时候几乎一样，只是规模更大而已。二百多万国民党军，为着美国的和中国的反动派的利益，正在进攻人民革命军。美国人将海军的六分之一集中在中国海面，并在中国设立特别陆战队。按官方的公布，陆战队兵力不过二万二千五百人，而非官方的估计却达八万人。他们曾“移让”给蒋介石以最新式的轰炸机约千架，还有大量的军用摩托车，各种武器以及数目巨大的“剩余物资”。
    日军曾自称只是要保护华北的重要交通线，而今天在华北的美军却具有同样的任务，他们正在热心开枪打倒在田地里劳作的中国农民，他们正在对中国人民军队作战。有些人以为强占其他国家的唯一办法，只是像日本之在中国或者德国在欧洲各国一样，以大军进行侵略，树立自己的政府，而且像过去日本帝国主义者或德国法西斯一样残暴的加以统治。这是侵略者的极端形式。可是，不要忘了，在某一个时候，日本帝国主义者曾经梦想以其恶名昭彰的二十一条来俘虏中国。另外，也还要记住，当时中国的独裁者袁世凯曾经宣告他有接受这些条件的决意。如果不是因为中国人民的抗议和其他好些原因，日本无疑的早已用不着不雅观的军事侵略而成为中国的主人了。如果从美国国会所通过的援华法案来仔细分析目前的中美关系，就可以看出和日本二十一条件所列举的相差无几。当时日本要求中国陆海军必须聘请日本教官，中国总算拒不接受；而在今天，美国人却已将他们的军事教官硬派给中国人。除此而外，甚至硬给中国人派去了整批的陆军部队和整个的海军舰队，都是他们的军官和人员。而所有这一切，国民党反动派却都一口答应了。
    以前日本曾要求他们输往中国的货物和在中国的工业、银行、铁道、交通、贸易等企业的投资，应享有最优惠的待遇。可是，由于中国人民的地区以游击战和抵制日货的形式给予坚决的抵抗，甚至在他们所占领的中国领土上都没有充分实现其目的，虽然国民党的官员时常替他们向内地推销日货而救了他们一把。而今天，美国人却在自己军队和国民党军队的保护下，俨然成了中国市场上无可争辩的主人翁。“中国工业化的水晶宫”还没有筑起来，而美国人却早已破坏了中国民族工业，使千万中国小制造业与商人破产停业。写到这里，值得重提一下去年十月二十日美国国务院远东司司长范宜德所广播的声明，他说美国的政策是要支持美国在中国的商务活动，并加速其恢复。他们正在为他们自己利益，设法使商业公司的代表回到中国去。他说他打算让他们尽可能赶快回到上海、香港、天津和其他港口去。美国教会机关也是同样的坦率。
    在目前的情形下，任何一举一动，成千百万的中国人都感受到它的结果。例如说，过去六个月间，中国国民党地区养活着约二百万工人及其家属的一千五百个工业厂家为什么会倒闭呢？那是因为美国进口货只缴纳很低的进口税，或者甚至根本不用纳税，使得中国企业无利可图，而且无力与美国对华出口的厂家竞争。那末，蒋介石政府又为什么不和他本国民族工业的灾害作斗争呢？那就是因为为美国独占资本家正在狂热的帮助这一个政府去镇压中国人民，剥夺中国的独立。（转载解放日报）
