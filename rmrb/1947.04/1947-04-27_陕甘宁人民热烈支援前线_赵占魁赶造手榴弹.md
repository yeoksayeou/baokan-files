　　Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 18th. Zhao Zhankui, the most famous labor hero of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, has shown an even more vigorous spirit in the war to defend the border region. Under extremely difficult conditions, he was able to devise methods to self-burn coke and rush to manufacture a large number of hand grenades to supply the front lines. Under the influence of Zhao Zhankui, the chairman of their trade union, the general workers are in high spirits. Now no one cares about the daily working hours system anymore, as long as there is work to do, they work day and night. Thanks to Comrade Zhao Zhankui's patient leadership, some family members (more than thirty women) are now also participating in foundry work under his leadership. Previously, they could only participate incidentally in light work such as making bullets, but now they are actively participating in heavy labor.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 22nd. Twenty-four primary school students under the age of fifteen from Xinning County, Longdong, actively participated in the work of hospitals, supply stations, and warehouses during the Huachi Campaign, lasting for half a month, and were highly praised by all parties. The pupils who participated in military service transferred with the troops four times. They carried their own luggage, cooked their own meals, chopped wood, and carried water. Their work was full of joy and vigor. They also bought melon seeds to comfort the wounded and sick soldiers. Primary school student Li Bingyun became good friends with a wounded soldier. Before parting, he wrote the wounded soldier's name in his diary, gave the wounded soldier a new pair of shoes, and made an appointment to communicate later. The wounded soldiers often told the primary school students battle stories and stories about Commander-in-Chief Zhu De's frugality. The students working in the warehouse have learned how to measure, weigh, and keep accounts without any mistakes. In contact with the masses, they also returned the masses' utensils on time, compensated for damages, and cleaned houses. They were welcomed and praised by the masses everywhere.

　　陕甘宁人民热烈支援前线
    赵占魁赶造手榴弹
    【新华社西北十八日电】陕甘宁边区最著名的工人劳动英雄赵占魁同志，在保卫边区的战争中，更加表现了老当益壮的积极精神。在非常困难的条件下，他能想出办法自烧焦炭，赶造出大批手榴弹供应前方。一般工人在自己工会主任赵占魁的影响下，工作情绪非常高涨。现在已无人再计较每天几小时的工作制度，只要一有工作就昼夜不停的做着。由于赵占魁同志的耐心带头，现在一部分家属（三十多个妇女）也由他领导起来参加翻砂工作。以前她们只能附带地参加些做子弹等轻工作，现在她们已积极参加重劳动了。
    【新华社陕北二十二日电】陇东新宁县完小廿四个十五岁以下的小学生，于华池战役中，积极参加医院、兵站和仓库等工作，历时半月，极为各方赞许。参加随军服务的小同学们，随部队转移四次，他们自负行李，自己作饭、砍柴、担水，工作中充满愉快活泼。并买瓜子慰劳伤病员。小学生李秉云和一个伤员交成好朋友，临别时把伤员名字记在日记本上，并送了伤员一双新鞋，约好以后通信。伤员们经常和小学生们一起讲战斗故事，讲朱总司令节约的事。仓库工作的同学已学会摸斗、捉秤、记账，没一点差错。在与群众接触中，更做到按时还群众用具，损坏则赔偿，打扫房屋等事。他们到处受到群众的欢迎与赞扬。
