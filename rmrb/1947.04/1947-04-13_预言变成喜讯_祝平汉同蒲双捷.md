　　Prophecy Becomes Good News
    Congratulations on the Victories of the Pinghan and Tongpu Campaigns
    After our army actively withdrew from Yan'an, the General Headquarters of the People's Liberation Army issued a prediction to the people of the whole country on March 26: "Please wait for good news in a few days." Now the prediction has become good news, and reports of victories are pouring in: On March 25, our Northwest People's Liberation Army annihilated the main force of the 31st Brigade of the Chiang army near Yan'an in one fell swoop. On April 3, the Northeast Democratic Allied Army annihilated one division and one regiment of the Chiang's 13th Army in Southern Manchuria. Our Jinji-Luyu troops launched powerful offensives in the areas of northern Henan, southern Shanxi, and Henan-Anhui-Jiangsu at the end of March and the beginning of April. This offensive is just beginning, and it will continue to give the Chiang's army remaining on the Pinghan and Tongpu lines a thorough and decisive blow. Now let Chiang Kai-shek and Hu Zongnan "celebrate the capture of Yan'an"! The spokesman of the General Headquarters of the People's Liberation Army is right, this is called "short-lived happiness," and this is called "treating a chicken feather as an arrow and being complacent."
    Since the Jinji-Luyu People's Liberation Army launched its offensive from March 27 to April 8 for twelve days, it has achieved brilliant results. According to preliminary and incomplete statistics, it has recovered fifteen cities, including Qi County, Yanjin, Fengqiu, Yuanwu, Yangwu, Puyang, Yicheng, Fushan, Jiang County, Xin＠, Hejin, Jishan, Taikang, Tongxu, and Ningling, as well as important strongholds such as Houma, Yumenzhen, Mengcheng, Yigou, and Hebi. It has controlled more than 300 li of the Pinghan and Tongpu railways, annihilated more than 16,000 Chiang and puppet troops, including more than 12,000 Chiang soldiers below the rank of Deputy Brigade Commander Wang Shuchen of the 27th Brigade, and seized a large amount of materials. In the Hejin and Yumenzhen areas alone, more than 2 million rounds of ammunition were seized. But this is only a part of our expected results, and the best is yet to come. We can tell everyone that this offensive has been prepared for a long time, and we only waited for the Chiang-Hu army to take risky actions in the western battlefield before we suddenly launched it. We have repeatedly warned Chiang Kai-shek in good faith, pointing out that the Chiang army's lack of troops and vast battle lines are its fatal weaknesses, and that Yan'an must not be attacked in any case. If you want to take a resolute risk, you will only lift a stone and hit your own foot, and you will definitely be defeated. Please see today's facts as proof.
    This offensive has three characteristics: First, the Chiang army drew away its main force to attack Yan'an and Shandong, and it had already turned to a passive and inferior position in the battlefields of Hebei, Shandong, Henan, and Southern Shanxi. Our army launched an offensive with overwhelming superiority; Second, it directly and effectively cooperated with the western battlefield, especially the offensive in southern Shanxi and the Fen River basin, which decisively eliminated the 49th Regiment of the 17th Brigade and a part of the 27th Brigade of Hu Zongnan in one fell swoop, and then swept the triangular area of ​​southern Shanxi like a broken bamboo. Cut off the communication between Hu's army in Shaanxi and Shanxi, threatening the right rear of Hu's army in northern Shaanxi; Third, the main focus of the initial stage of the offensive was to destroy the Chiang army's railway lines, eliminate a large number of local bandits and puppets (this is a great harm to the people), seize a large amount of war materials, and recover large areas of lost land, laying the foundation for annihilating a large number of Chiang army's active forces in the future. This offensive was especially painful and sad for Chiang and Hu. The Tongpu Line and southwestern Shanxi were painstakingly managed by Hu Zongnan with more than ten brigades and at the cost of losing more than three brigades over seven months. However, the offensive of our Taiyue People's Liberation Army in just five days smashed the joint defense system of Hu and Yan into a mess, and a large number of military materials were seized by us. At present, most of the area in southern Shanxi has returned to the situation before the outbreak of the civil war in July last year, and the Taiyue Liberated Area has achieved great development; especially the Fen River basin is extremely rich, which is not comparable to the sparsely populated northern Shaanxi. Hu Zongnan lost it so easily, but he was marching in northern Shaanxi hungry, and was trapped in the raging flames of guerrilla warfare everywhere, and was in danger of being wiped out at any time. This is where Hu Zongnan is most painful and frustrated. The Pinghan Line is Chiang Kai-shek's dream. Last winter, the Chiang army faced Handan and Xingtai across the Zhang River twice, and was greedy, and also made a big joke for this. They published in the newspapers what "the northern and southern armies of Pinghan have joined forces in Xingtai," "the 'bandit army' around Handan has been 'suppressed'" and so on, but unfortunately it was just a mirage. The Chiang army was never able to cross the Zhang River for one step. On the contrary, the section from Zhengding to Baoding north of Shijiazhuang was cut off by our Jin-Cha-Ji People's Liberation Army in one fell swoop, and is still under our control. And this time our army's attack completely destroyed the railway from Anyang to Xinxiang, and Chiang Kai-shek's illusion of opening the Pinghan Line is getting farther and farther away, which is Chiang Kai-shek's most sad place.
    Under our powerful offensive, Chiang Kai-shek's military crisis is becoming more and more profound, the Chiang army's battle lines are becoming more and more chaotic, and Chiang Kai-shek can no longer transfer any reserve troops. He originally retained three reorganized divisions of his direct lineage in the southwest and central China, which were used to deal with possible "popular uprisings" in the rear. This time, he simply used them all on the front line. The Tenth Reorganized Division defending Chongqing has been used in northern Shaanxi; the Ninth and Sixty-Sixth Reorganized Divisions defending Kunming and Wuhan were originally planned to be used in the East China battlefield, but they were hurriedly transferred to Xinxiang when northern Henan was alarmed. The two divisions in Xinjiang simply cannot move; in this way, Chiang Kai-shek can no longer transfer any reserves. He can only take care of one thing and lose another, waiting to be beaten, and one less will be eliminated for each one. A senior commander of the Chiang army and another senior general once privately discussed: "How many brigades can be eliminated if they are eliminated one by one?!" The director of the Second Department of Chiang's Ministry of National Defense said more bluntly: "We are not up to par, and we keep giving gifts to others, feeding them fat." This is the point of Chiang Kai-shek's military crisis. Chiang Kai-shek's erroneous strategic guidance cannot be corrected. What is the policy that Chiang Kai-shek is adopting now? It is a policy that neither preserves itself nor eliminates the enemy, also called a policy of losing both people and land, and it is also the most stupid and unsuccessful policy in the world. Chiang Kai-shek did not try hard to "preserve himself and eliminate the enemy," but it is absolutely impossible; the reason is very simple, Chiang Kai-shek's policy is a policy of selling out the country, dictatorship, and civil war; since the policy is wrong, the strategy that serves politics is bound to be wrong, and the result is the accelerated collapse and destruction of Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorial rule, which is very certain.
    Our army's offensive this time is by no means accidental, but the result of the concerted efforts of the military and civilians, commanders and fighters, field corps, local troops, the front and rear, who are determined to make contributions to the people, vow to defend Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, and work diligently and hard. Everyone has only one goal: to fight to defend Chairman Mao, to strive for new offensive victories. In the past two months, the military and civilians in the whole region have been gearing up and their morale has been unprecedentedly high, and the power of the people's war has been fully exerted. This is the basic reason for the initial victory of this offensive.
    Now our army's offensive is expanding fiercely, and the military and civilians in the whole region are fighting to strive for greater victories. We can tell our Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao that we have full confidence and perseverance, and we vow to defend you with victorious actions. We can also tell the military and civilians in the western battlefield that your struggle is not isolated, and the two battlefields are closely linked; our offensive will greatly disrupt the deployment of the Chiang-Hu army, which will be conducive to your mobile operations. We can also tell the soldiers on the front lines of Pinghan, Tongpu, and other areas and behind enemy lines in Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu that you are fighting side by side and supporting each other. You have made outstanding achievements. The people of the whole region are supporting you with the greatest enthusiasm. 60,000 new soldiers are about to rush to the front lines to participate in your operations. Most of them are working hard to learn technology and are waiting for orders to depart. Hundreds of thousands of militiamen and self-defense forces have gone to the front lines to participate in the war. The great land reform in the whole region, the battle to completely eliminate feudalism is about to end victoriously, and the great production movement is about to begin. Your families are moving from emancipation to prosperity; the good news of your meritorious service has been widely spread to all counties and districts and your families. The people in the rear are cheering and celebrating your heroic achievements, and erecting plaques and congratulating the families of the combat heroes. This is your supreme glory. The people of the whole region have only one expectation for you: vigorously expand victory, meticulously organize battles, guard against arrogance and rashness, be good at using our wisdom, capture all opportunities, fight bravely, reduce our army's casualties to the lowest level, concentrate superior forces to annihilate more of the enemy's active forces, and annihilate the Chiang army's regular army. This is the best time for us to make contributions to the people. Soldiers on the front lines! Advance bravely!
    Comrades on the rear front, your contribution is as important as the victory on the front line. Your tasks are arduous, and you must seize the current opportunity of victory, vigorously mobilize the masses in the liberated areas and recovered areas, and establish a democratic order; you must ensure the completion of war support tasks; you must repeatedly check in the liberated areas to finally and completely eliminate feudalism, fully mobilize backward masses, and adjust the relationship between cadres and the masses; you must carry out the spring plowing and production movement with the greatest strength on the basis of solving the land problem; you must continue to improve the quality and output of military industrial production; all areas that have not yet completed the task of joining the army should complete all of them in April and strive to exceed the target. Completing the above tasks is the greatest contribution to the people and the most effective support for the war!
    In order to strive for continuous and greater victories, let the military and civilians in the whole region be involved in the great meritorious movement! Do your best, contribute your strengths, work hard to kill the enemy, work hard, and produce hard. A new victory is about to come!

### 预言变成喜讯  祝平汉同蒲双捷

　　预言变成喜讯
    祝平汉同蒲双捷
    我军主动撤离延安后，人民解放军总部即于三月二十六日向全国人民发出预言：“不要几天请大家听捷报。”现在预言已变成喜讯，捷报纷传：我西北人民解放军三月二十五日于延安附近一举歼灭蒋军三十一旅主力，四月三日东北民主联军于南满再歼蒋十三军之一个师又一个团，我晋冀鲁豫部队复于三月末四月初先后向豫北、晋南及豫皖苏等地区发动强大攻势，这一攻势方在开始，它将继续给残留在平汉、同蒲两线上的蒋军以彻底干脆的打击。现在让蒋介石、胡宗南之流去“庆祝延安的攻占”吧！人民解放军总部发言人说得很对，这就叫做“短命的高兴”，这也叫做“鸡毛当令箭，自鸣得意”。
    晋冀鲁豫人民解放军自三月廿七日至四月八日十二天攻势以来，已获得辉煌战果，据初步不完全统计，已收复淇县、延津、封邱、原武、阳武、濮阳、翼城、浮山、绛县、新＠、河津、稷山、太康、通许、宁陵十五城及候马、禹门口、蒙城、宜沟、鹤璧等重要据点，控制平汉、同蒲两铁路共三百余里，歼蒋伪军一万六千余，内俘蒋军廿七旅副旅长王树忱以下一万二千余，缴获物资特多，仅子弹一项在河津、禹门口地区即缴二百余万发。但这只是我们预期战果的一部分，精彩的尚在后面。可以告诉大家，这一攻势准备已久，只待蒋胡军在西战场冒险行动起来，我们就突然发动。我们早就善意的多次警告过蒋介石，指出蒋军兵力不足、战线辽阔乃其致命弱点，无论如何进攻不得延安；如欲坚决冒险，只会搬起石头打自己的脚，必败无疑；请看今日之事实可以为证。
    此次攻势有三个特点：第一、是蒋军抽走主力进攻延安、山东，在冀鲁豫和晋南战场早已转为被动与劣势，我军以压倒优势主动发动攻势；第二、直接有力的配合西战场作战，特别晋南及汾河流域的攻势，一举手即干脆消灭胡宗南之十七旅四十九团及二十七旅一部，以后即势如破竹横扫晋南三角地带。切断胡军陕晋交通，威胁陕北胡军右后方；第三、攻势初期主要在于毁灭蒋军铁道线，肃清地方大批匪伪（这为人民去一大害），缴获大量战争物资，收复大块失地，奠定今后大量歼灭蒋军有生力量之基础。此次攻势对蒋胡分外沉痛，分外悲切。同蒲线及晋西南是胡宗南集中十个旅以上兵力，费了七个月时间，损失三个多旅的代价苦心经营的，但我太岳人民解放军仅五天的攻势就将胡阎的联合防御体系打得落花流水，大量军用物资为我缴获，现晋南大部地区已恢复去年七月内战爆发前的态势，并使太岳解放区获得巨大发展；特别汾河流域富饶异常，比之陕北地广人稀诚不可同日而语。胡宗南竟轻轻丧失，却在陕北饿着肚子游行，处处陷于游击战争的漫天火焰中，还随时有被歼灭的危险，这就是胡宗南最沉痛懊丧之所在。平汉线是蒋介石梦寐以思的，去冬蒋军两临漳河遥望邯郸、邢台，馋涎欲滴，也曾为此大闹过笑话，在报纸上大登起什么“平汉南北两军已会师邢台”，“邯郸周围‘匪军’已‘肃清’”等等，但可惜只是个幻影而已，蒋军终不得越漳河一步。相反，石家庄以北正定至保定段被我晋察冀人民解放军一举切断，至今仍为我控制。而此次我军出击，又将安阳至新乡段铁路彻底毁灭，蒋介石打通平汉线的幻影是愈来愈远，愈来愈渺茫了，这是蒋介石的最悲切处。
    在我强大攻势下面，蒋介石的军事危机愈益暴露得深刻了，蒋军的战线更显得散乱了，蒋介石再调不出什么后备兵来；他在西南和华中原保留有三个整编的嫡系师，是用来对付大后方可能发生的“民变”的，这次索性也全部使用到前线来。其守备重庆的整十师已用于陕北；守备昆明和武汉的整九师、六六师本拟用于华东战场，豫北告警仓惶调来新乡，其它在新疆有两个师根本动弹不得；这样蒋介石就根本再调不出什么后备了。只能顾此失彼，等着挨打，被消灭一个就少一个，有一个蒋军的高级司令官和另一个高级将领曾私议道：“这样一个一个旅被消灭下去，有多少可以供消灭的？！”蒋记国防部第二厅长说得更坦白：“我们不争气，不断给人家送礼，把人家喂肥了。”这是蒋介石军事危机一针见血的地方。蒋介石错误的战略指导是无法改正的。蒋介石现在采的方针是什么呢？是既不保存自己亦不消灭敌人的方针，又叫做人地两失的方针，也是世界上最愚拙最失败的方针，蒋介石未当不努力想“保存自己消灭敌人”，但绝不可能；原因很简单，蒋介石的政策是卖国独裁内战的政策；政策既错，服从于政治的战略势必错误，其结果是蒋介石独裁统治的加速崩溃和毁灭，这是肯定得很的。
    我军此次攻势决非偶然，乃是全区军民、指战员、野战兵团、地方部队，前线后方戮力同心，立志为人民立功，誓死保卫毛主席、保卫党中央，兢兢业业、发奋努力的结果。大家唯有一个目标：为保卫毛主席而战，为取得新的攻势胜利而奋斗，两个月以来全区军民磨拳擦掌，情绪空前高涨，人民战争的威力充分发挥，这是此次攻势初步胜利的基本原因。
    现在我军攻势正在猛烈扩张，全区军民正为全力争取更大的胜利而战斗，我们可以告慰于我党中央和毛主席，我们是有充分信心与毅力的，我们誓以胜利的行动保卫你们。我们也可告慰西战场的全体军民，你们的斗争不是孤立的，两个战场密切结合；我们的攻势必将大大错乱蒋胡军的部署，有利于你们的机动的作战。我们亦可以告慰于平汉、同蒲等前线及豫皖苏敌后战斗的将士们，你们正在比肩作战互相策应，你们战功卓著，全区人民正以最大热情全力支援你们，六万新战士即将涌赴前线，参与你们作战，他们大部正在努力学习技术，待命出发。数十万民兵自卫队已走向前线参战，全区土地大改革，彻底歼灭封建的战斗即将胜利结束，大生产运动即将开始，你们的家庭正由翻身走向富裕；你们的立功的喜报已普遍传至各个县区和你们的家庭，后方人民正欢欣鼓舞庆贺你们的英勇战绩，为战斗英雄的家属立匾贺功，这是你们的无上光荣。全区人民对你们只有一个期望：猛烈扩张胜利，精细的组织战斗，戒骄戒燥，善于使用我们的智慧，捕捉一切战机，勇猛作战，减少我军伤亡到最低程度，集中优势兵力更多的歼灭敌人有生力量，歼灭蒋军正规军。这是我们为人民立功的最好时机，前线的将士们！勇猛前进！
    后方战线的同志们，你们的贡献也与前线上的胜利同等重要，你们的任务是繁重的，必须抓紧当前胜利的时机，猛烈发动解放区和收复区群众，建立民主秩序；必须保证战勤任务完成；必须在解放区内反复检查最后彻底消灭封建，充分发动落后群众，调整干群关系；必须在解决土地问题的基础上以最大力量开展春耕生产运动；必须继续提高军工生产的质量和产量；一切尚未完成参军任务的地区，应于四月内全部完成并力争超过。完成上述任务就是对人民最大的功绩，对战争最有效的支援！
    为争取连续的更大的胜利，让全区军民都卷入伟大的立功运动中来吧！各尽所能，各献所长，努力杀敌，努力工作，努力生产，新的胜利就要到来！
