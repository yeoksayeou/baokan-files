　　Gaotang New District
    Implements Land Reform
    [This newspaper, Jinan, 16th] After more than a month of efforts in sweeping away puppet bandits and calling on puppet bandits to repent in the Gaotang New District, a victorious completion has been achieved, the situation is becoming clear, and the peasants are urgently demanding the realization of "land to the tiller." Some villages have already started settling accounts with traitors, local bullies, and landlords. For this reason, the County Committee has resolved that the central task for the next three months is to vigorously and rapidly promote land reform, eliminate feudal landlords, and fairly and reasonably distribute the fruits.
