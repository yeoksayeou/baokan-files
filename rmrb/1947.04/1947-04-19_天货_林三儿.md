“Natural Born” Lin San'er
Kang Ding

Young Lin San'er was the chairman of the farmers' association in Dongzhu Village after the peasants were emancipated. After the Chiang Kai-shek army invaded Dongzhu Village, he moved to the small villages around the village. However, Liu Dashao, the village landlord, became the director of the Chiang Kai-shek's "Land Mediation Committee," colluding with landlords who had been struggled against, baring their fangs and claws to reverse the land distribution of the peasants... and in order to vent his anger, he offered a reward of 500,000 "legal tender" to capture Lin San'er.

When Lin San'er was a child, because he was brave, the children in the village didn't call him by his name, but only by his nickname: "Natural Born." Since the Chiang Kai-shek army occupied Dongzhu Village, and after hearing that Liu Dashao wanted his head, he formed a small guerrilla team with the militiamen who had retreated with him, and everyone named it the "Emancipation Fighting Team." Lin San'er was elected as the captain, and he took on both literary and military affairs. From then on, he often said to his team members and emancipated peasants: "If you want to live, you must not be afraid of death. If you are afraid of death, you can only let Liu Dashao live alone."

A company of the 90th Division was stationed in the village, and the "Land Mediation Committee" and the stubborn village office were in Liu Dashao's courtyard. Soldiers of the 90th Division were on guard there. Where did Liu Dashao live? … The peasants in the village told him everything in detail. So he selected and mobilized eight militiamen, brought eight guns, and everyone prepared their equipment. Not long after the sun went down, they set off.

They bypassed the sentry of the 90th Division, assigned two militiamen to monitor the entrance of the enemy's bunker, and also to serve as guards to block the road. He led the remaining six people and sneaked to Liu Dashao's door. The guard asked them, "Who?" Lin San'er was about to answer, "Of the 90th Division," but the two militiamen had already pounced on him, blocking the guy's mouth, snatching the gun, and whispering, "Don't shout! If you shout, I'll kill you!" At this time, Lin San'er had already led four other militiamen and rushed into Liu Dashao's house. Liu Dashao, the compilation village chief, and two women were playing mahjong, "Red Middle" and "White Board." A group of people suddenly rushed in, the lights were put out, and Liu Dashao was dragged out of the courtyard by Lin San'er, grabbing his neck. At this time, the troops of the 90th Division had already discovered it. While being chased by the enemy, they killed Liu Dashao and the compilation village chief, and then rushed out of the village.

The next day, the news spread, and the people were very happy, but some people criticized Lin San'er for being too brave. But Lin San'er tilted his head and rolled his eyes, saying indifferently, "The village is built by us, and the road is walked by us, can he catch a ball!"

After suffering a loss, the enemy closed the door at night and dared not run around in the village again. Once night fell, except for the courtyard where the enemy was stationed, the entire village became Lin San'er's territory again; no one dared to handle the affairs of the "Land Mediation Committee" anymore, and it naturally collapsed; the landlords who had reversed the peasants' land with Liu Dashao quickly returned the land to the peasants while hiding it from the Chiang Kai-shek army, and apologized to the peasants, saying: "I didn't want to reverse the land distribution originally, but Liu Dashao forced me to do so." They all pushed the blame onto the dead.

Lin San'er led several new comrades in a meeting to arrange work for the struggle against the enemy. Sometimes the meetings went late, so they boldly slept in the village, at the east house today, and the west house the next day, and got up and left before dawn.

Lin San'er's tireless work has won the support and love of the masses. When women met him, they patted him on the shoulder and said, "San'er! You have to worry about it!" But San'er smiled and said, "The farther away from the enemy, the more dangerous. Approaching them instead allows for easier access to information, making it easier to deal with the enemy."

As time passed, the enemy learned that Lin San'er sometimes returned to the village, so they plotted to capture him.

One moonless night, Lin San'er returned to the village again. Most of the people in the village didn't know, but a squad leader of the 90th Division saw him—a tall man with a gun in his hand, looking around at the turn in the road, and then quickly slipped into the courtyard of bachelor Lin Laicheng and closed the courtyard door immediately. The squad leader went back and reported to the company commander. The company commander guessed that it must be Lin San'er, and without further inquiry, he urgently assembled the troops and rushed to surround Lin San'er.

Lin San'er and Lin Laicheng had just turned on the lights and were about to go to bed without undressing when they heard chaotic footsteps outside the courtyard. Knowing that things were not good, they immediately got up. Some of the soldiers of the 90th Division had already climbed over the wall and jumped into the courtyard, banging! Banging on the door: "Open the door quickly!" Lin San'er put his gun up and fired a shot out the window. The Chiang Kai-shek soldiers outside the window made a rumbling sound, pushed back a few steps, leaned against the corner of the wall and fired back into the window, and shouted, "Surrender and you won't be hurt!" Lin San'er replied, "I, Lin San'er, won't be a good man until I fight you to the end!" Then he fired another shot. The company commander of the 90th Division heard that it was really Lin San'er, and became even more energetic, personally shouting, "The gun belongs to the Eighth Route Army, but your life is your own, it's better to surrender!" The reply inside the house was: "The gun belongs to the Eighth Route Army. But the Eighth Route Army is mine."

So the enemy's rifles and grenades were fired at the windows and doors of Laicheng's house with all their might. After a long time, they didn't hear any more shots from inside the house, and the shouts no longer answered. The company commander of the 90th Division said, "I must have killed a grandson!" He ordered the soldiers to open the window and go in to see, but there was no one, and no corpse was found. While they were wondering, someone suddenly shouted outside the village: "I, Lin San'er, am here, please come and catch me!" "Bang!" Another shot was fired.

The Chiang Kai-shek soldiers searched back and forth in the house, and found an underground cave in Lin Laicheng's back kiln. Lin San'er and Lin Laicheng had slipped away from this underground cave. So the Chiang Kai-shek army came with great interest, and left in disappointment.

After that, the people in the village called Lin San'er "Natural Born" again; but this was different from before. Before, "Natural Born" was his nickname, but today's "Natural Born" is his glory. At first, only the people in his village called him that, but since participating in the county-wide Heroes Conference, all the peasants in the county knew that there was a "Natural Born" Lin San'er in Dongzhu Village, who was the county's hero in emancipating the people and killing the enemy.

　　“天货”林三儿
    康丁
    青年林三儿是东朱村农民翻身后的农会主席，自从蒋家军侵占东朱村后，他就转移到村周围的小庄上。村里的地主刘大少，却当起蒋家“土地调解委员会”的主任来，纠合被斗地主，张牙舞爪的倒算农民的土地………并且为了出他的一口气，大破了五十万元“法币”悬赏捉拿林三儿。
    林三儿小时因为胆子大，村里孩子们都不叫他的名字，只叫他的外号：“天货”。自从蒋家军占了东朱村，并且听说刘大少拿他的脑袋，他把同他一起退出来的民兵组成了一支小型的游击队，大家把它定名为“翻身战斗队”。林三儿被选为队长，他也就又办文事、又办开武事来了。从此他常对他们的队员和翻身农民说：“要活就不怕死，怕死就只好让刘大少一人活去”。
    村里扎着九十师的一个连，“土地调解委员会”和顽村公所就在刘大少的大院里。九十师的哨兵在那里站岗，刘大少住在那屋子？……村里的农民出来都一五一十的告给了他。于是他挑选和动员了八个民兵，带了八条枪，大家准备好了行装。等到太阳落后不久，他们就出发了。
    绕过九十师的哨兵，分配两个民兵监视起敌人的碉堡门口，又担任封锁路口的警戒。他带着其余的六个人，摸到刘大少的门口，门岗问他们：“谁”？林三儿正在答：“九十师的”，两个民兵却已扑上去，堵住那家伙的嘴，夺去枪又低声命令道：“不准喊！喊就打死你！”这时，林三儿已带了另外四个民兵，急步冲入刘大少的家里。刘大少、编村长，还陪着两个女的，正在“红中”、“白皮”的打麻将，轰隆扑进来一伙人，灯也打灭了，刘大少被林三儿捏着脖子拖出了院门。这时九十师的队伍已经发觉，他们在敌人的追击中把刘大少、编村长打死以后，随即奔出村来。
    第二天消息传出，人心大快，却也有人批评林三儿太勇。可是林三儿却头一歪眼一翻，满不在乎的说：“村是咱修，路是咱走，他能捉住个球”！
    敌人自吃亏以后，一到晚上就把门关起来，不敢再在村里乱跑。一到夜晚，除过敌人扎的院子外，全村就又成为林三儿的天下了；谁也不敢再办“土地调解委员会”的事，自然垮台；跟着刘大少倒算了农民的地主，赶忙瞒着蒋军重新退还给农民土地，并向农民道歉说：“本来我就不愿倒算，是刘大少迫着非算不可”。都往死人身上推。
    林三儿领导着几个新同志开会，布置对敌斗争的工作，有时会开晚了，也就大胆睡在村里，今天在东家，再天到西家，等天不明就起来走了。
    林三儿的不疲倦的工作更取得群众的拥护和爱戴，妇女们遇到他，也拍着他的肩膀说：“三儿！可得操心哩”！可是三儿笑着说：“越离敌人远越危险，倒是接近了，消息灵通，容易对付敌人”。
    日子长了，敌人知道林三儿有时回村的消息，就计谋来捉他。
    一个没月亮的晚上，林三儿又回到村里，村里人大都不知道，却叫九十师一个班长看见——，一个高个子手里提着一条枪，在转湾的路上四处看了一下，就紧步闪入光棍林来成院里，马上关起院门来。这班长回去报告了连长，连长猜想这一定是林三儿，也不去再作打听，紧急集合起队伍，奔来包围林三儿。
    林三儿和林来成刚刚打了灯，没脱衣服睡下，听得院外乱纷纷的脚步声，知道不好，马上爬起来，九十师的士兵，有的已翻墙跳进院来，砰！砰的打门：“快开门！”林三儿揣起枪顺窗打出一枪，窗外的蒋家兵轰隆一声，拥着倒退几步，仗凭着墙角往窗里还枪，又喊：“缴枪不伤命！”林三儿回答说：“我林三儿不和你们干到底，不算好汉！”接着又打出一枪。九十师的连长听说真是林三儿，劲头就更大，亲自喊：“枪是八路的，命是自己的，还是交了合算”。屋里面回答道：“枪是八路的。八路可是我的”。
    于是敌人的步枪、手榴弹一股劲的往来成的窗上门上打，打了老大一阵不听得屋里还枪，喊叫也不再答应，九十师的连长说：“一定打死个孙子啦”！命令士兵打开窗进去一看，人也没有，死尸也不见，他们正在奇怪时，村外忽然有人喊道：“我林三儿在这里，请来捉吧”！“砰”！又打来一枪。
    蒋家兵在屋内寻来寻去，在林来成的后窑里寻得一个地洞，林三儿和林来成就是从这地洞里溜走了。于是蒋家军兴趣勃勃而来，落了个败兴而去。
    此后，村里人又叫起林三儿“天货”来了；不过这和从前不一样，从前“天货”是他的外号，今日的“天货”是他的光荣，起初只是他村里人叫，自从参加全县群英大会后，全县的农民，都知道东朱村有个“天货”林三儿，就是全县的翻身杀敌英雄。
