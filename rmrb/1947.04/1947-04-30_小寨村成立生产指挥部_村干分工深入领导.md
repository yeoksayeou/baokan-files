　　Xiaozhai Village Establishes Production Headquarters
    Village Cadres Divide Labor to Deepen Leadership
    [Our Newspaper, Jinnan, 28th Dispatch] Village cadres in Xiaozhai Village, Second District of Jize, have specifically divided their labor to establish a production headquarters to directly lead production. All 30 mutual aid teams in the village have been incorporated into squads and platoons. A mass meeting was held recently to mobilize a spring plowing campaign. At that time, challenges for production were launched between teams, squads, and platoons, guaranteeing the completion of planting within 12 to 25 days. In order to further advance the production work, the village cadres decided to leave only the village deputy Lan Zhaoji and secretary Lan Guangketo be responsible for miscellaneous village affairs, while all other village cadres participated in leading production. Village chief Lan Zhufeng, along with Wang Daqing and Su Tongjiang, served as agricultural committee members, ensuring that all mutual aid teams in the village could thoroughly cooperate and resolve all difficulties in agricultural production. Lan Guangpu and two others served as deputy industry committee members, ensuring that each agricultural mutual aid team would combine agriculture with sideline occupations; 24 teams have already done so. Central Elementary School Principal Li Yaoting and teacher Wang Mingkui served as propaganda committee members, regularly producing blackboard newspapers, praising models, encouraging production enthusiasm, and promoting production policies and the benefits of mutual aid production. The Children's Corps, in order to ensure that there was not a single lazy person in the village, collectively sang production ditties on the streets every evening, broadcasting great production news. All the village cadres are working harder and harder, wholeheartedly focusing on improving production, and the masses' production enthusiasm is exceptionally high.
    [Our Newspaper, Qinyang Dispatch] Tiger Village organized a Production Committee to uniformly lead, and the village's production work has gained momentum. At a village cadre meeting, they reviewed the reasons why production had not improved and found that the main reason was inconsistency and the lack of a unified leadership organization. In order to strengthen organizational leadership, they proposed organizing a Production Committee, composed of seven members: the village chief, the militia committee director, the women's association chairman, the production committee member, the farmers' association chairman, the elementary school teacher, and the cooperative cadre, with the village chief as the chairman and the others as members. The chairman is responsible for convening meetings, supervising, inspecting, and researching issues, and grasping the overall situation. The farmers' association chairman is responsible for leading the farmers' association cadres to play a backbone role in production and to organize the masses. The militia committee director is responsible for leading the militia to strengthen sentry duty and eliminate spies and special agents to protect production. The women's association chairman is responsible for organizing women's weaving and resolving difficulties in weaving. The elementary school teacher compiles production-related ditties and slogans, organizes radio stations and mass blackboards, and promptly commends models and active individuals in production, as well as typical facts in production, to encourage everyone's enthusiasm for production. The cooperative cadre is responsible for solving the problems of agricultural tools, implements, and raw materials in production, and promoting local native products and finished products, and providing loans to households that truly have no other means. The production committee member is responsible for investigating, statistically researching, and resolving the difficulties in the masses' production, becoming familiar with production conditions, improving tools, increasing production volume, and creating models. Since the organization of the Production Committee, cadres have proposed at meetings that cadres should play a model role, personally working to make contributions to the people of Tiger Village, starting with their own homes to create models and promote the whole village. The day after the meeting, women's association chairman Li Shaoqing, Mu Guilan, and Zhou Qikui roughly organized three weaving mutual aid teams. There were 28 people, with 68,000 yuan in funds, and they have begun mutual aid production. (Qing Kui)
