　　Land Reform Promoted in Border Areas of Xia County
    Women Carry Guns to Participate in Struggle
    [This newspaper's Taiyue dispatch, 3rd] Land reform is being actively promoted in the border areas of Xia County, and the broad masses of women are also involved in the movement. The county had once carried out land reform last year, but most villages were forced to stop due to the invasion by Chiang's army. After we recovered some villages before the Lunar New Year this year, we vigorously publicized the land reform policy, and the Fourth District took the lead in launching the movement. By mid-February, four villages had distributed the fruits of the struggle, five villages had concluded the struggle, and two villages were in the midst of the struggle. In the movement, the broad masses of women also actively participated in the struggle and were allocated the fruits of the struggle. For example, after an old woman from Chaiwa Village participated in the Land Reform Committee, she actively carried out liaison work and organized fifty women to participate in the struggle in four days. Women in Xigou carried guns to guard the targets of the struggle.

　　夏县边地推行土地改革
    妇女背枪参加斗争
    【本报太岳三日电】夏县边地积极推行土地改革，广大妇女亦卷入运动。该县去年曾一度进行土地改革，后大部村庄因蒋军侵占，被迫停止。今年旧历年前我收复部分村庄后，乃大力宣传土地改革政策，四区首先展开运动。至二月中旬，已有四个村分配了果实，五个村斗争结束，两个村正在斗争。运动中广大妇女亦积极参加了斗争，并分得果实。如柴娃村一老婆参加土地改革委员会后，积极进行串通，四天工夫即组织了五十个妇女参加斗争。西沟妇女背着枪看守斗争对象。
