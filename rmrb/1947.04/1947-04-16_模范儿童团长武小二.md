Model Children's Corps Leader Wu Xiaoer

　　At dawn on March 4th, the people of Wu Caiyuan in the eighth district of Yunbei were still sound asleep when over a hundred Chiang soldiers suddenly raided the village. Like beasts, they ransacked homes, creating chaos and uproar, and drove all the villagers to the square, searching for the village chief and the head of the farmers' association. But no matter how they asked, they couldn't get a definite answer. After threatening nine old men without success, the Chiang soldiers pulled out a fourteen-year-old child for questioning. Coincidentally, this child was the leader of the children's corps—Wu Xiaoer. But Xiaoer stood calmly in front of the village chief and the head of the farmers' association, not saying a word. "Little brother, tell the truth, which one is the village chief? Which one is the head of the farmers' association?" "There is no village chief here! Nor a head of the farmers' association!" Wu Xiaoer replied. "Ha, you little brat, you won't tell the truth!?" "Hit him!" The beasts viciously tore at his ears and hit his head. "Damn it! Speak! If you don't speak, we'll beat you!" the Chiang soldiers said. "Still no!" "If you don't speak, beat him! Hang him up and beat him!" Xiaoer was hung on a tree and suffered a brutal beating of slaps, gun butts, and leather shoes. After that Xiaoer said: "I'll talk, I'll talk, let me down and I will talk." The beasts let Xiaoer down, at which time the village chief Wu Liangxiu looked furious, but the beasts spotted him. "Good! You are the village chief!" Followed by a bayonet thrust. "Don't stab him, he is not the village chief, he is my uncle," Xiaoer said. "Are you the village chief?" The beasts kept asking, Wu Liangxiu said: "I am not the village chief, I am his uncle." The masses also said in unison: "That can't be wrong, he is Xiaoer's uncle, to tell the truth, the village chief and the head of the farmers' association have long been away from home!" "Damn it, you still won't tell the truth, hang him up and beat him again!" Xiaoer, who was hung up again, suffered another brutal beating. "Don't beat me, I'll talk! I'll talk! Let me down, I'll talk!" The child deceived the beasts again. Then the village chief and head of the farmers' association all broke out in sweat, but the child pretended to be looking for the village chief and the head of the farmers' association, walking around the crowd and said: "There really is no village chief here, nor a head of the farmers' association." "Damn it, this little brat is still being difficult! We have to beat him hard, hang him up and beat him again!" The beasts hung Xiaoer up for the third time and beat him brutally, but still could not get any confession, and had to return in disappointment. (Reported by the Ji-Lu-Yu Branch)

　　模范儿童团长武小二
    三月四日拂晓，郓北八区武菜园的群众还在熟睡中，蒋军百余突然袭入村庄，野兽们除翻箱倒柜闹得鸡飞狗跳外，并将全村群众驱集广场上，搜寻村长和农会长，但他们问来问去没得到确实回答。蒋军于威胁九个老头没结果后，就拉出一个十四岁的儿童来审问，恰巧这个儿童正是儿童团长——武小二。但小二镇静地站在村长和农会长面前一句话也不说。“小兄弟说实话，那个是村长？那个是农会长？”“这里没有村长！也没有农会长！”武小二回答。“哈，小崽子，不说实话吗！？”“揍！”野兽们狠命的撕他的耳朵，打他的头。“他妈的！说！再不说还打你”！蒋军说。“还是没有！”“不说，揍！吊起来揍！”小二被吊在树上了，饱尝了一顿耳光、枪托和皮鞋的毒打后，小二说：“我说，我说，您放开我就说。”野兽们把小二放了下来，这时村长武良修气极色变，被野兽们发觉了。“好！你就是村长！”跟着就是一刺刀。“您可不要刺他，他可不是村长，他是我的叔叔。”小二说。“你是不是村长？”野兽在追问着，武良修说：“我不是村长，我是他叔叔。”群众也一齐说：“那还能错了吗，他是小二的叔叔，实话说，村长和农会长老早就不在家里啦！”“他妈的，还不说实话，再吊起来揍！”再次被吊起来的小二又挨了一顿毒打。“别打啦，我说！我说！放开我，我说！”孩子又欺骗野兽们，这时村长农会长都捏了一把汗，被放下的孩子装着寻找村长和农会长的样子，环绕着人群走了一遍后说：“这里真没有村长，也没有农会长。”“他妈的，这小崽子还要刁哩！不狠揍不行，吊起来再揍！”野兽们第三次把小二吊起来毒打后，仍然没有问出一点口供来，只得败兴而归了。（冀鲁豫分社）
