    From Western Shandong to Northern Henan
    Li Pu
    This war in northern Henan was another "digging out the heart" campaign. This is a tactic General Liu Bocheng often uses. The People's Liberation Army crossed western Shandong and southern Hebei to fight in the heart of the Nationalist army in northern Henan, a journey of about 500 li. After marching 200 li, upon reaching Puyang County in Hebei, the PLA entered the Nationalist-occupied area.
    The reporter set out with considerable curiosity, thinking there might be an encounter with the enemy along the way, but in fact nothing happened. We settled down in ×, about 30 li southeast of ××. This was March 22nd, the first night of this trip we spent in Nationalist-occupied territory. Except for the east, the northwest and south were all Nationalist strongholds, only about 30 li away. The PLA did not immediately go to deal with them, nor did they dare to touch us. We arrived late at night and rested the next day, then continued our advance that evening. When it was time to rest, we rested well, taking off our clothes for a comfortable sleep. During the war against the Japanese devils, people often slept with their clothes on, fearing a surprise attack by the devils. But the Nationalist soldiers, after being severely beaten by us in previous campaigns, were long since terrified. They don't have the skills of the Japanese devils! Shameless robbery and rape have made them a bandit gang hated by the people. They know which side the people are on, so they dare not show their faces in the dark. In short, I unknowingly entered the Nationalist-occupied area.
    Last November, during the Puyang-Hua County campaign, when I first came to the Liberated Area, I visited the battlefield for the first time. I passed through this area then, and it took a lot of effort each time to find guides along the way. But this time, people everywhere volunteered to lead the way. Everywhere, the common people gathered around cheerfully. Even the most insensitive person could feel this completely new atmosphere. I chatted with the guides, and after a winter of land reform, the peasants had been given land, so they were particularly active and interested. So when we mention "Nationalist-occupied area," don't think of it as a vast area. In fact, it's just a few isolated strongholds. Later, we met General Li ××, the commander of the military sub-district in this area, who told me some very interesting stories: Ten days before we passed through, on March 13th, a meeting of more than 4,000 peasants was held in Gangshang Village, near our camp, to resolve land issues. The Nationalist army from Puyang dispatched a regiment in three routes to "mop up," but they were beaten back by the people's local armed forces, and the people suffered no losses. It is said that the purpose of this "mopping up" operation was fourfold: first, to sabotage land reform; second, to demonstrate force to the people. Originally, the Nationalist army had demanded 3,000 strong men from Puyang, but the people had petitioned against it once and were refused. They were given a deadline of one week to deliver them all, but they failed to do so. The puppet county government said: "The four villages are all full of Eighth Route Army guerrillas, and they dare not leave the city." Li Jiaying, the brigade commander of the Nationalist army's 127th Brigade, had no choice but to send a regiment of troops out to show off. Third, they also wanted to seize some strong men and grab some grain. Fourth, the guerrillas had killed a Nationalist army deputy company commander the day before, so they were taking this opportunity to retaliate. It turned out that on March 12th, two scouts from the local armed forces went to a village near the county seat and found dozens of Nationalist soldiers there robbing grain and demanding the people's fat pigs. These two scouts pretended to be members of a home-returning corps and walked over, saying that they had just gotten two pigs from a village in the south and found some Eighth Route Army soldiers. The pig herders ran away, and they had driven the pigs to the ditch ahead and asked him to help. The deputy company commander was overjoyed and left his troops to continue searching for grain, taking only a messenger with him out of the village. The two scouts thought that it would not be easy for just two of them to deal with two enemy soldiers. One of them reported to the deputy company commander that the Eighth Route Army soldiers might not have run away and that it would be best to take some troops with him. This frightened the deputy company commander, and he immediately told the messenger to go back and call the troops. In this way, they grabbed him. They originally wanted to bring him back, but the guy was strong, and the two scouts had no choice but to shoot him dead. They took off his insignia and left his body for the Nationalist soldiers who came out to demand fat pigs.
    The next night, we went dozens of li deeper. Passing through Bagong Bridge, when we rested, the people told me that the floating wealth had already been distributed, and they were distributing land these days. They had organized their own militia. In the rear of the Nationalist army, they were "holding a gun in one hand and distributing land in the other."
    On the third night, we camped near Niushi Village. Niushi Village is located between the four county towns of Hua County, Changyuan, Fengqiu, and Yanjin, all about 60 li away. It is the transportation center of these counties and the only stronghold between them. The so-called Second Hebei Security Brigade was stationed there. The PLA conveniently eliminated it, capturing more than 1,000 people. The most interesting thing was that as soon as the battle was over, the attacking troops immediately withdrew, and another unit took over the defense. The relief troops gathered on the street, went to a house to rest and cook, and half an hour later, a soldier heard some noise upstairs. He climbed up to take a look and found a whole company of Nationalist soldiers still there. They obediently laid down their weapons and came downstairs. They had no interest in fighting for Chiang Kai-shek. Otherwise, with just a few grenades, everyone downstairs would have been finished. Are the PLA soldiers made of indestructible steel? Chiang Kai-shek should reflect on the reason for this.
    With the Niushi Village stronghold removed, Chiang Kai-shek had no other strongholds within a hundred li. The deeper we went into the rear of the Nationalist army, the more we felt their emptiness and weakness. Chiang Kai-shek's heart was so weak. Here I should particularly mention that on the newly built highway near Yanjin City, the guerrillas hit a Nationalist army car on March 15th and captured Gao Qiangbin, the deputy brigade commander and director of the political department of the 47th Division's 127th Brigade. Before the reporter set out, he happened to meet him. This person was sallow and thin, and I don't know why he kept shivering as he walked.
    I followed the car all the way. In the car, I kept thinking that if we didn't boldly mobilize the masses, carry out land reform, and launch a people's guerrilla war, would we dare to drive so safely in the Nationalist-occupied area, sleep so comfortably, and be able to strike straight at his heart?

### 从鲁西到豫北

    从鲁西到豫北
    李普
    这次豫北战争，又是一次挖心之战。这是刘伯承将军惯用的战术。人民解放军从鲁西横穿河北南部，到豫北蒋军的心脏地带作战，全程约五百华里。行军两百华里之后，到达河北的濮阳县境，解放军就进入了蒋军占领区。
    记者怀着颇大的好奇心出发，以为途中也许可能和敌人遭遇一下，事实上什么也没有发生。我们在××东南约三十里的×地住下来，这是三月二十二日，是此行在蒋占区宿营的第一晚。除了东面之外，西北南三面都是蒋军的据点。相距不过三十华里左右。解放军没有立即去收拾他们，他们也不敢来碰一碰。我们在深夜到达此地，第二天休息了一天，晚上又继续前进。该休息就好好休息，我们脱下衣服来舒舒服服的睡觉。在打日本鬼子的时期，人们往往是和衣而卧。恐怕鬼子们奔袭，可是蒋军们在我们历次沉重的打击之下，早就吓破了胆，他们那有鬼子们那样的本事！无耻的抢劫奸淫，使他们成为人民所痛恨的匪帮；他们深知人民是站在那一方面的，因此，黑夜里不敢出头。总而言之，我就这样在不知不觉之中进入蒋军侵占区了。
    去年十一月下旬濮滑战役时，记者初来解放区，第一次参观战场。曾经经过这一带，那时沿途找向导，每次都要费许多工夫。可是这一次到处有人自动带路。到处有老百姓兴高彩烈的围拢来。这种焕然一新的气象，即使是极迟钝的人都感觉得到的。我和向导们攀谈起来，经过一个冬季的土地改革运动，农民们分到了土地，因此他们特别积极，特别有兴致。所以当我们提到“蒋军侵占区”的时候，你不要以为是很广大的一片，其实只是几个孤立的据点而已。后来我们碰到这一带的军分区司令李××将军，他告诉了我几个很有趣味的故事：在我们过路的十天之前，三月十三号，在我们宿营地附近的岗上村，举行了一个四千多农民的大会，解决土地问题。濮阳蒋军出动一个团，分三路“扫荡”，结果给人民地方武装打了回去，人民没有受到半点损失。据说这次“扫荡”的用意有四个：第一破坏土地改革；第二向老百姓示威。原来蒋军向濮阳要三千个壮丁，老百姓请过一次愿不准，限定一个星期之内送齐，不料过期没有送去。伪县政府说：四乡都是八路军的游击队，他们不敢出城。蒋军一二七旅旅长李家英没有办法，只好派一团的部队出来显显威风。第三就是顺便抓一些壮丁，抢一些粮食。第四，前一天游击队打死了蒋军一个副连长，借此出来报复一番。原来三月十二号那天，地方武装的两个侦察员，走到县城附近一个村子里，发现了几十个蒋军在那里抢粮食，并且要老百姓的肥猪。这两个侦察员便冒充还乡团走过去。说是刚才带了一些人在南面村子里弄到了两口猪，发现有几个八路军，赶猪的老百姓便跑掉了。现在将猪都赶到了前面沟里，请他去帮忙。副连长喜出望外，留下他的队伍继续搜索粮食，自己只带一个传令兵跟着他们走出村子。这两个侦察员想到自己只是两个人，对付对方两个人总不大容易。其中有一个便报告副连长：那几个八路军可能还没有跑掉，最好带一点队伍去。这一下把副连长吓住了，便立刻叫传令兵回去叫队伍。这样他们一把抓住了他，本来想把他带回来，不料那家伙身强力大，那两个侦察员只得手起一枪解决了他。摘下他的符号，留下他的尸首给那些出来要肥猪的蒋军打去。
    第二天晚上，我们深入了好几十里。经过八公桥，休息的时候，老百姓告诉我这里的浮财已经分了，这几天正在分土地。他们自己组织了民兵。在蒋军后方，他们就是这样“一手拿枪、一手分田”。
    第三天晚上，我们在牛市屯附近宿营，牛市屯在滑县、长垣、封邱、延津四座县城之间，距离都在六十里左右，是这几个县城交通的中心，而且是它们之间唯一的据点。所谓河北保安第二旅驻在那里。解放军顺便解决了它，俘虏了一千多人。最有趣的是战斗刚刚结束，攻击的部队立即撤走。由另一个部队去接防。接防者在街上集合，到一家屋子里去休息做饭，半点钟后，有一个战士发现楼上有什么声音，爬上去一看，原来是整整一个连的蒋军还在那里。他们顺从的放下武器，走下楼来。他们一点也没有为蒋介石拚命的兴趣。否则只要几颗手榴弹，楼下的人就全部完了。难道解放军战士是什么打不死的金钢吗？蒋介石应该反省反省这是什么道理。
    牛市屯的据点一拔掉，周围百多里以内蒋介石就再没有什么别的据点了。越是深入蒋军后方，越是感到他们空虚的薄弱。蒋介石的心脏原来是这样衰弱。这里我应该特别提一提，延津城在它附近刚刚修好的汽车路上，游击队于三月十五号打了蒋军一辆汽车。活捉了四十七师一二七旅的副旅长兼政治部主任高强斌。记者此次出发之前，恰巧见他一面，此人面黄肌瘦，不知道为什么总是一面走一面大打哆嗦。
    这一路我是跟着汽车走的。在汽车上老是想着假使不放手发动群众，进行土地改革，展开人民游击战，我们敢在蒋军的侵占区内这样放心的开车，舒舒服服的睡觉，并且能够这样直捣他的心脏吗？
