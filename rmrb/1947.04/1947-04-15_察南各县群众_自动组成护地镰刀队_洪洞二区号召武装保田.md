Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th: Land reform in most areas of the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region has been initially completed. Review work is currently underway in the core areas of Chahar South, Ji-Jin, and Ji-Zhong. Six hundred thousand farmers in six counties, including Chahar South, Xuanhua, Zhuolu, Huaian, Yuxian, Wanquan, and Yangquan, have recovered more than two million mu of land from landlords. After the completion of the review work in the mountainous areas of Zhuolu and Yuxian, the review is being carried out in the border areas of each county and along the Ping-Sui Railway line, combined with the struggle to protect the land. In villages such as Zhaojiashan in Xuanhua and Pingfangsi in Zhuolu, farmer youths spontaneously organized land-protecting scythe teams, which have become very common in various counties of Chahar South. The peasants resolutely opposed the bloody counterattack of the landlords and the Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops. Their slogan is: "The grain has been eaten, and the land has been taken back, and we will not return it. If you want to fight, then do it." Land-protecting guerrilla warfare is most intense in the areas along the Chahar South, Ping-Han, and northern section of the Jin-Pu Railways, as well as the Ping-Sui Bao triangle area. For example, villages on both sides of the Xushui Railway, more than twenty villages along the Jinghai Canal, and more than eighty villages along the Sanggan River in Datong have mostly completed land reform in the tense guerrilla warfare. Large numbers of liberated peasants have poured into the local guerrilla forces to defend the land. Wanping and Daxing, near Beijing, are also under review.

This Newspaper, Taiyue, 13th: The Hongtong Second District Headquarters called on villages that have completed land reform to continue armed land protection movements. When the Pingyuan Village in the Second District was distributing fruits after settling accounts with the landlords, it was suddenly surrounded by Chiang's troops. In addition to seizing twenty-five head of cattle and dozens of pieces of clothing, the village head's three children were killed. After learning this lesson, the District Headquarters immediately called on all villages in the district that have completed land reform not to be careless, but to continue to consolidate and develop their armed forces, strengthen their martial arts training at all times, and defend the fruits of their liberation. The Jandi Village militia has grown from nine to *** members. Liberated peasants are actively donating money to buy guns to defend their land.

    自动组成护地镰刀队
    洪洞二区号召武装保田
    【新华社陕北十三日电】土地改革在晋察冀边区大部地区，已初步完成。察南、冀晋及冀中的腹心地区，现正进行复查。察南、宣化、涿鹿、怀安、蔚县、万全、阳全等六县六十万农民，已自地主手中收回土地二百余万亩。涿鹿、蔚县山区复查工作完成后，正结合护地斗争，在各县边地及平绥沿线展开复查。宣化赵家山、涿鹿平方寺等村农民青年，自发组织的护地镰刀队，在察南各县已极普遍。农民坚决反对地主与蒋伪军的血腥反攻，他们口号是：“粮食吃了，地是收回来了，就是不退，要打就动手”。护地游击战在察南、平汉、津浦北段沿线地区及平绥保三角地带为最猛烈。如徐水铁路两侧的村庄，静海运河沿岸二十余村及大同桑乾河沿岸八十余村，多已在紧张的游击战争中完成土地改革，翻身农民大批涌入当地游击队保卫土地，北平近郊之宛平、大兴亦在复查中。
    【本报太岳十三日电】洪洞二区指挥部号召，完成土地改革的村庄，继续武装进行保田运动。二区平原村清算地主后，正在分配果实时，突被蒋军包围，除抢去二十五头牛及被服数十件外，并杀害该村村长子女三人。区指挥部接受此教训后，立即号召全区完成土地改革的村庄，万勿大意，继续巩固发展武装，时时加强练武，保卫翻身果实。涧底村民兵由九名发展为×××名。翻身农民正积极捐助买枪，保卫土地。
