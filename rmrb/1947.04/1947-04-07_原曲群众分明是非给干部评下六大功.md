　　【Further News】When Yuanqu Village in She County carried out the unity movement, on one hand, it formed a working team of 130 people composed of cadres and activists, who went to backward masses in winter schools to pour out their grievances. On the other hand, it actively mobilized cadres to "wash their faces and blacken their spots" in winter schools. The cadre Pei Dongcheng's family of eight had six rooms originally, and this time they were given three more rooms, and secretly bought 1,200 yuan worth of fruit coupons and two poplar trees. He usually acted with an attitude. This time, more than 800 people raised opinions about him. Dongcheng felt sorry for the masses and broke through all his concerns, taking the lead in making a thorough self-criticism to the masses at the meeting. After the self-criticism, the masses unanimously said, "You are so frank, we forgive you!" At this time, the leadership took advantage of the enthusiasm to mobilize cadres with more shortcomings: "As long as you wash your face clean, the masses will never retaliate." Subsequently, six cadres with more shortcomings made thorough reflections. At this time, the leadership, on the other hand, enlightened the masses to recall the history of their liberation, from which they recognized the merits of the cadres. For example, an honest peasant said, "The cadres really put in a lot of effort in fighting the landlords. Chen Xiangjun, for example, worked so hard leading us in our liberation that his eyes turned red." Wu Sanzhong said, "If it weren't for the cadres leading us in our liberation, how could we have recovered our houses and land?" A few masses who retaliated against the cadres were corrected by correct opinions. For example, Li Zhongtang said, "The cadres even returned the extra fruit shares to us. Besides, even gods can't avoid making mistakes." Zhang Xinzeng said, "Only talking about the cadres' faults, how about we examine whether we are backward or not!" After the whole village freely discussed the matter in dining halls, streets, and "idle people's groups," they unanimously decided to recognize the cadres' six great merits in leading the resistance against Japan, rent reduction, production, disaster relief, resistance against Chiang Kai-shek, and land reform over the past ten years. On March 11, a conference of 1,300 men and women was held, and a total of 49 model cadres were selected and awarded merits, and the masses congratulated them. (Yuanqu Correspondence Group)

　　原曲群众分明是非给干部评下六大功
    【又讯】涉县原曲村进行团结运动时，一面把干部、积极分子组成一百三十人的工作大队，分头串通落后群众到冬学诉苦，一面积极动员干部到冬学洗脸擦黑。干部裴东成家八口人，原有六间房，此次又分了三间楼，并暗买了一千二百元的果实条子，买了两棵杨树，平常作事好起态度。这次有八百以上的群众给他提出意见。东成觉得对不起群众，打破了一切顾虑，第一个在大会上向群众彻底作了检讨。检讨后，群众一致说：“你这样坦白，我们原谅你！”这时，领导上便乘热劲动员错误较大的干部：“只要脸洗净，群众决不会报复”。接着，六个缺点多的干部都作了彻底反省。这时，领导上又从另一面启发群众回忆翻身历史，从中认识了干部功劳。如老实农民说：“斗争地主，干部可真出力不小，像陈相君年时领导咱翻身，眼都熬红了。”吴三仲说：“要不是干部领导咱翻身，那能收回咱的房子田地。”有少数群众对干部报复，即被正确意见打回去了。如李忠堂说：“人家干部多分果实还给咱退，再说，就是神仙也免不了错呀。”张新增说：“光说干部有不对，检讨一下咱落后不落后！”全村经过在饭场、街头、“闲人伙”到处自由座谈后，一致决定给干部立十年来领导抗日、减租、生产、渡荒、抗蒋、填补六大功劳。三月十一日，召开男女千三百人的大会，共选出四十九位模范干部，分别予以立功，群众纷纷贺功。（原曲通讯组）
