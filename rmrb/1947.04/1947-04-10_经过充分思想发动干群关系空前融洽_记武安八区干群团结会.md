After Full Ideological Mobilization, Cadre-Masses Relations are Unprecedentedly Harmonious
  　A Record of the Cadre-Masses Unity Meeting in the Eighth District of Wu'an
    From the 20th to the 24th of last month, district and village cadres and honest peasants from the eighth district of Wu'an held a "Unearth the Problems" conference of over 800 people. This conference has become a crucial turning point in the in-depth land reform movement in the eighth district, enabling cadres and the masses (especially honest peasants) to unite closely and thoroughly eliminate feudalism and fill the gaps.
    This conference was generated on the following mass foundation: First, land reform in the eighth district had been relatively successful, leading to complacency. Cadres and thoroughly liberated masses wanted to immediately shift to production, while peasants who were not thoroughly liberated felt they lacked land and tools. The fruits accumulated in the villages were intended by cadres to be simply distributed, but honest peasants demanded a fair and reasonable distribution. Second, before the 10th, the district held a village cadre meeting where leaders proposed boldly mobilizing the "backward" and thoroughly resolving the land issue. However, after returning, everyone still lacked enthusiasm, and the honest peasants remained unmoved. Based on these circumstances, the eighth district decided to convene a comprehensive "Unearth the Problems" conference involving all district cadres, new and old activists, and honest peasants, to thoroughly advance land reform. A total of 197 village cadres, 22 old activists, 140 new activists, and 457 honest peasants from all 40 villages in the district attended, along with district and county cadres.
    On the first day of the meeting, cadres and masses conducted ideological mobilization separately. For the cadre side: first, each village reported on its mass movement. After the reports, the leadership called on each cadre not only to report but also to listen to everyone's opinions, thereby laying the foundation for cadres to accept mass opinions at the conference. For the mass side: villages were divided into groups, with one or two cadres with relatively good cadre-mass relations from each village participating in the group to support the masses and encourage everyone to raise their problems. Honest peasants saw their own strength, saw that everyone had grievances, and especially saw that cadres could stand up for them. As a result, the problems bottled up in their hearts burst forth like a dam breaking, and the mood of the masses immediately surged.
    On the second day, a plenary cadre-mass meeting was held, and the masses raised opinions to the cadres. Every honest peasant scrambled to raise problems, with 268 people speaking that day, raising 192 cases of unfair distribution, 110 cases of being hit by cadres, activists, or militia, and 16 cases of cadres shielding landlords. These problems, in general, revolved around cadres and activists getting more fruits and being wasteful, and cadres having poor work styles and abusing people. The masses even compiled these kinds of things into rhythmic verses, describing their inner pain: For example, peasants who had not been liberated said: "Whenever I mention difficulties, I want to cry. Comparing the situation makes me angry. Outsiders are a living pit, locals are a bottomless pit." "I have bitterness in my heart but cannot speak out. I am apprehensive about speaking at the conference. Activists speak quickly, and we can't get a word in and become 'backward.'" Protected households who had been deceived by landlords said: "Landlords have so many tricks. They grab our tails and pressure us. Just when we are about to struggle against them thoroughly, they bring packages to our homes. The women at home are soft-hearted and put the packages in the cabinet. When the Farmers' Association holds a meeting against protection, we have something on our conscience and dare not mention it. If we say it, we're afraid of what will happen, but if we don't say it, we're letting Chairman Mao down." Women said: "Men are actively dividing outside. We're afraid that men will cause trouble. Landlord women come to visit. Although we hate them, we also pity them. They say they want to borrow a liter of rice, and we'll give them two." Old men said: "Young people say we're useless and don't treat us like adults." Everyone expressed their opinions in this form, so the meeting proceeded extremely lively and harmoniously. Everyone felt more comfortable than holding meetings in the village. Each village even automatically sent people back to communicate, calling on those who had not come to participate. The meeting originally had only 600 people, but on the third day it increased to over 800. After raising opinions, most honest peasants demanded a thorough resolution of the land issue, and those who had gained more fruits were asked to return them. A small number of people also proposed removing cadres from their positions.
    The masses raised opinions at the meeting during the day, and the cadres rectified their work style in the evening. Over two evenings, two ideological problems of village cadres were resolved: First, at the rectification meeting, village cadres were first mobilized to raise opinions to district cadres and to complain (about gaining too many fruits, hitting cadres, undemocratic work styles, and production in the office). District cadres accepted all these opinions and made sincere self-criticisms. Most village cadres were very moved. They said: "This is like the masses raising opinions. We raise opinions to the district cadres and they are not angry. The masses should not be angry when they raise opinions to us!" Second, during the rectification, many cadres also reflected: If we are cadres and the masses raise so many opinions, do we still have a future? Are we going to follow the path of Xu Shuizi? (Xu was the political director of Baishi Village in the north. He was accused of embezzling struggle fruits and was instigated by landlords, struggled by the masses, beaten, and had his property confiscated. The government also detained him.) Another group of cadres said: "The masses are raising all our shortcomings, but do we have any merits? Our village used to do good work. Is there any benefit to our work after this?" At this time, county and district cadres immediately made self-criticisms, reviewed the past habit of focusing on cadres' shortcomings, and also acknowledged the mistake of handling Xu Shuizi's case. They then explained the cadre policy in detail, acknowledged everyone's merits, and pointed out that the liberation of 33,000 peasants in the eighth district was due to the efforts of every village cadre. If it weren't for the efforts of village cadres, Chairman Mao's policies could not be implemented in concrete terms. The mood of each cadre began to lighten at this time, but some cadres also proposed: We accept honest peasants' opinions, but we cannot accept some "sharp" people exaggerating mistakes and taking private revenge. Everyone discussed this again and unanimously agreed: Opinions are raised through democracy, and problem-solving must also go through democracy. It's not that whatever someone says goes. The opinions of truly honest peasants must be helped to be resolved. Incorrect opinions will be corrected by the masses through discussion. Only by resolving the problems of honest peasants and uniting them can bad elements have no chance to exploit. We can then defeat bad elements. If we are afraid of honest peasants raising opinions, honest peasants will not raise opinions to us. Bad elements can easily use honest peasants to attack us. Therefore, implementing democracy and letting everyone raise opinions means that honest peasants will follow us, not bad elements. Subsequently, the issue of cadre prestige was discussed: Why are cadres busy all day long? Isn't it to mobilize the masses? Everyone is liberated. If the masses have problems and are not allowed to raise them, how can the masses be mobilized? Once the masses raise all their problems, they take a step closer to us. This is the glory of the cadres. If the masses have problems but dare not raise them to the cadres, that means the cadres have no prestige. That proves that they usually suppress the masses. In this way, everyone hoped that more opinions would be raised in their village. Cadres in villages where the masses raised fewer problems felt uncomfortable. At this time, cadres were no longer afraid of the masses raising opinions, but felt the difficulty of being a good cadre supported by the masses. Based on their own experience, they discussed that to be a good cadre, one must overcome ten major difficulties: 1. Lead by example, but don't take over everything. 2. Let everyone be the master, but ensure that everyone has no objections. 3. Eat and wear your own, but don't distribute more fruits while working for the people. 4. Implement instructions from above, but also listen to the feedback from the masses. 5. The task is heavy, and the demands are urgent, but you can't force orders. 6. Work busily, but you can't stop working. 7. Get rich yourself, but also take care of the whole village. 8. Work hard for the masses, but also accept criticism from the masses. 9. Be willing to get your face dirty, but don't lose heart. 10. Do everything well, but don't be afraid of making mistakes. At this time, county and district cadres promptly encouraged everyone and said: We are working in so many difficulties, and we are all doing very well, which proves that everyone is a good cadre. This time the masses are raising opinions to everyone, which will make our work even better. By this time, the mood of the cadres had completely turned to the positive side.
    At the third day's meeting, district cadres first made self-criticisms to the masses, and all district cadres returned more than 800 cases of buying fruits cheaply on the spot. At this time, village cadres could no longer endure it and demanded self-criticisms, especially cadres from villages such as Sanbaishu, Beihedi, and Beixizhuang, whose self-criticisms were extremely thorough, even confessing things that the masses did not know. They compared their past lives and said with great distress: "We forgot our poor brothers and sisters and are so sorry for everyone." Among them, 15 village cadres reported to the masses on the spot the extra fruits they had distributed and firmly stated that they would return them all after returning to the village. The undivided fruits in the village were immediately distributed to honest peasants, and then feudalism was thoroughly eliminated to achieve complete leveling and replenishment. During the self-criticism process of each cadre, hundreds of honest peasants constantly applauded enthusiastically, expressing their welcome to the cadres. Some masses who had thoughts of overthrowing the cadres also completely calmed down. The meeting went on very late that day. During dinner, honest peasants in the dining hall were discussing everywhere. Yao Yuanquan, an honest peasant from Nanzhuang, said: "This time the cadres are of one mind with us. The other day we talked all about the shortcomings of the cadres, but they also have merits!" Many people agreed with his opinion on the spot, wanting to praise the cadres' merits and work together to eliminate feudalism and fill the gaps after returning. Finally, another day of meetings was organized, where the masses praised the merits of the cadres. The masses from every village spoke, and cadre-mass relations were unprecedentedly united and enthusiastic. Cadres had full confidence in their future work and felt that after returning to the village, everyone would raise opinions, everyone would be the master, everyone would talk about shortcomings, and everyone would praise merits. Everything had a solution, and everyone dared to do everything. Honest peasants also felt reassured. Many people immediately demanded to solve their own problems on the spot. By the end of the meeting, both cadres and masses were truly smiling.
    After these honest peasants returned to the village, they immediately became activists in the village, and a new upsurge of eliminating feudalism and filling the gaps was launched. Eight honest peasants who had hesitated to attend the meeting immediately became activists in the village after returning, and conducted communication day and night in the village to enlighten the masses to raise problems. Village chief Zuo Yuhua took the lead in withdrawing the extra fruits he had distributed at the village meeting and said: "We must take out even the slightest mistake." After the meeting, honest peasant Wang Baogui automatically reported the bad guys to the cadres and confessed that he had been fooled. Currently, the masses in each village of the eighth district are enthusiastically scoring the fruits and continuing to eliminate feudalism.
    After the meeting, in addition to rewarding village cadres who voluntarily returned the fruits, the leaders of the eighth district summarized the gains of this conference: First, this conference overturned the previous overestimation of achievements and learned about the problems that were not understood in the past, which not only educated the leaders but also obtained a new method for inspecting work. Second, the conference truly achieved cadres educating the masses and the masses educating the cadres, which was a lively rectification that not only overcame the shortcomings of the cadres but also protected the emotions of the masses. Third, this method of using activists on such a large scale to form a movement and promote honest peasants is faster than mobilizing village by village, which is a progress in leadership methods. Fourth, we were satisfied with letting go in the past, but now it proves that in the in-depth movement stage, we must let go even more, especially to honest peasants. As long as we let go, honest peasants are not difficult to mobilize. Fifth, we used to think that village cadres could not save face and could not accept the opinions of the masses, so we accommodated the cadres, which was actually not believing in the cadres. This time it proved that cadres are connected to the masses and can correct their shortcomings. (Liu)

　　经过充分思想发动干群关系空前融洽
  　记武安八区干群团结会
    武安八区区村干部与各村老实农民，于上月二十日至二十四日，举行了八百余人的解圪塔大会，这次大会，已成为八区深入土地改革运动中干群（特别是老实农民）紧密团结起来，彻底进行挤封建、填圪道的一个重要关键。
    这次大会，是在如下的群众基础上产生的，第一、八区土地改革作得比较好，产生了自满。干部与翻透身的群众，要求马上转生产，没有翻透身的农民，却感到缺乏土地和农具。村里积压的果实，干部企图简单分一下，老实农民却要求分配得公平合理。第二、在十号以前，全区开了村干部会议，领导上提出放手发动“落后”，彻底解决土地问题，大家回去后，劲头仍不大，老实农民依然没有动起来。根据这些情况，八区就决定召开全区干部、新老积极分子和老实农民的一揽子解圪塔大会，以彻底推进土地改革。全区四十个村共到会村干部一九七人、老积极分子二十二人、新积极分子一四○人、老实农民四五七人，区干部和县干部亦参加。
    会议第一天，干部群众分开进行思想动员，干部方面：首先进行各村群运汇报。汇报后，领导上即号召每个干部，不光是汇报，还应听大家发表意见，这样来打下干部在大会上接受群众意见的基础。群众方面：以村为小组、每村选择一两个干群关系较好的干部参加小组，给群众撑腰，鼓励大家把圪塔提出来，老实农民看到自己的力量，看到大家都有苦，特别是看到干部能给他作主，于是闷在心里的问题，就像缺堤大水一样，汹猛的奔泻出来，群众情绪，立即高涨。
    第二天举行干群全体大会，群众向干部提意见。每个老实农民却抢着提圪塔，当天发言的有二六八人，提出填平不公的一九二件，受干部积极分子民兵打击的一一○件，干部包庇地主的十六件，派差不公的十六件，这些圪瘩总起来，不外是干部积极分子多分与浪费果实，干部作风不好乱碰人等问题。群众更以此类事，编成快板，叙述自己内心的痛苦：如未翻身的群众说：“一提困难就想哭，比比时光气死人，外来户是活圪道，本地户是坑没底。”“心里有苦嘴难诉，大会发言咱发蹙，积极分子说得快，咱插不上就‘落后。’”为地主所骗的包庇户说：“地主诡计真多端，拿着尾巴给咱按，眼看就要斗透了，拿着包袱到咱家，家里娘们心一软，包袱放在柜里边，农会开会反包庇，咱有心病不敢提，说出来怕不得了，不说对不起毛主席。”妇女说：“男人在外积极分，咱怕男人多惹人，地主女人来串门，虽然恨又可怜人，他说要借一升米，咱就给他挖二升。”老头儿说：“青年人说咱不顶事，处处不把看成人。”各种人都以这种形式来表达自己的意见，因而会议进行得极为活泼融洽。大家都感到比在村里开会还痛快，各村却自动派人回来串通，叫没有来的人都来参加，会议开始原只六百余多人，第三天即增加到八百余人，在提意见之后，大部老实农民都要求彻底解决土地问题，谁多得了果实，都要求退出来，很少一部分人，也提出要把干部撤职。
    群众白天大会提意见，晚上干部就整风，两天晚上，解决了村干部两个思想问题：第一、在整风会上，首先发动村干部给区干部提意见，发牢骚（多得果实打击干部，作风不民主，以及机关生产等）。这些意见，区干部全部接受了，并作了诚恳的自我批评。大部村干部都很感动，他们说：“这跟群众提意见一样，咱给区干部提意见人家却不恼，群众给咱提意见也应不恼才对呀！”第二、整风中，不少干部又反映出：咱当干部群众这样提意见，是否还有前途？是否要走许水子的道路？（许是北上白石村政治主任，因贪污斗争果实受了地主的挑拨，被群众斗争吊打，没收了家产，政府还把他扣起来。）另一部分干部说：“群众提的都是缺点，到底我们还有功劳没有？过去我村工作好，这一提工作还有好处吗？此时县区干部当场进行自我批评，检讨了过去看干部缺点多的毛病，同时也承认了处理许水子的错误，接着又详细解释了干部政策，承认大家的功劳，指出八区三万三千农民的翻身，就是每个村干的功劳，要是没有村干部大家努力，毛主席的政策那天也不能具体执行。每个干部的情绪，这时就开始轻松了，但有些干部又提出：老实农民提意见我接受，但有些“尖头”夸大错误，私人报复我们不能接受，大家又进行了讨论，一致认为：大家提意见是经过民主、解决问题也要经过民主，不是谁说啥就算啥，真正老实农民的意见，一定要帮助解决，不正确的意见群众一讨论就纠正了。只有解决了老实农民的圪塔，团结了老实农民，坏分子就无空子可钻。就能把坏分子打下去，要是咱怕老实农民提意见，老实农民也不给咱提意见。坏分子就容易利用老实农民打击咱。所以说，实行民主让大家提意见，老实农民就会跟咱走的；不是跟坏分子走的。随后又讨论到干部威信问题：当干部成天辛苦为了啥？还不是为了发动群众吗？大家翻透身，现在群众有圪塔不让提，还能发动群众吗？群众圪塔全提出，他们就向咱靠近了一步，这就是干部的光荣，要是群众有圪塔不敢向干部提，那才是干部没有威信，那才是证明平时他压制群众。这样一来大家却希望自己村里多提些意见，那村群众对干部圪塔提得少，那村的干部反感到不好受了。这时干部已不是怕群众提意见，而是感到作个群众拥护的好干部的困难了。他们根据自己的经验，讨论出当一个好干部必须克服十大困难：一、要带头又不能包办代替。二、让大家当家还得使大家都没意见。三、吃穿自己的，为人民大众工作还不能多分果实。四、执行上级指示还得听取群众反映。五、任务很重，要求紧迫，还不能强迫命令。六、工作忙的马不停蹄，还不能不去劳动。七、要自己发家还得照顾全村。八、辛辛苦苦为群众，还得接受群众批评。九、要洗脸擦黑还不能泄了劲。十、啥事要作好还不能怕犯错。这时县区干部又及时鼓励大家说：咱们就是在这样多的困难中工作，而且都做得很好，证明大家都是好干部。这次群众给大家提意见，就会使咱们工作做得更好。至此干部情绪已完全转到积极方面来了。
    在第三天大会上，区干部首先向群众进行自我批评，全体区干部当场退出八百多件贱买果实。此时村干部已再也不能忍耐，都要求自我批评，特别是三柏树、北河底、北西庄等村的干部，自我批评极为彻底，连群众不知道的事情，也坦白了，他们比了比过去自己的时光，很难受的说：“我们忘记了自已的穷兄弟，太对不起大家。”其中十五个村干部，当场就向群众报告了自己多分的果实，并坚决表示回村后要全部退出来，村里未分的果实，立刻分给老实农民，然后彻底进行挤封建全部达到填平补齐。在每个干部自我批评过程中，几百个老实农民却不断的热烈鼓掌，表示他们对干部的欢迎。有些群众有推倒干部的思想，也完全平下去了。当天大会开得很晚，在吃晚饭的时候，饭场里的老实农民到处在讨论。南庄老实农民姚远泉说：“这次干部可和咱一心了，前两天咱们讲的全是干部的缺点，可是他们也有功劳呀！”当场好多人却同意他的意见，要给干部表功劳，回去后好一齐挤封建、填圪道。最后又组织了一天大会，群众给干部表功劳、村村群众都发了言，干群关系空前团结热烈。干部对今后工作，有了充分信心，感到回村后，有大家提意见，有大家当家，有缺点大家说，有功大家表，一切事情都有了办法，一切事情也就敢干了，老实农民也感到有了保证。不少人当场即要求解决自己的问题，会议开到最后，不管干部和群众，都真正作到两头全笑了。
    这些老实农民回村后，立刻成了村里积极分子，一个新的挤封建填圪道的热潮掀起来了；徘徊开会回来的八个老实农民，立刻成了村里积极分子，并在村里白天黑夜进行串通，启发群众提圪塔。村长左玉华，首先在村民大会上退出自己多分果实；并说：“咱有一针一线的错误，也要拿出来。”会后老实农民王保贵自动向干部报告坏人，坦白自己上了当。现八区各村群众，正火热的进行评分果实，继续挤封建。
    会后八区领导上除奖励自动退果实的村干部外，又总结了这次大会的收获：一、这次大会推翻了过去对于成绩过高的估计，并了解了过去所不了解的圪塔，既教育了领导，也获得了检查工作的新方法。二、大会真正作到了群众教育干部，干部教育群众，这是一个活整风，既克服了干部缺点，又爱护了群众情绪。三、这样大规模运用积极分子，形成运动，推动老实农民的方法，比一村一村发动来得快，这是领导方法的一个进步。四、过去满足于放手，现在才证明：深入运动阶段，更要放手，特别是对老实农民要放手。只要我们放开手，老实农民也是不难发动的。五、过去以为村干部不能洗脸，接受不了群众意见，因此就迁就干部，实际上是不相信干部，这次证明干部是和群众有联系的，而且是能改正缺点的。（柳）
