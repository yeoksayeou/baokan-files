　　[From Our Reporter on the Northern Henan Front, 14th] The Northern Henan People's Liberation Army recovered the famous coal mine Liuhegou, as well as Shuiye, Lunzhang, Luxian and other important strongholds of Chiang Kai-shek's puppet regime, west of Anyang city, on the 11th. The results of the battle are still being tallied. After our Northern Henan People's Liberation Army smashed Chiang Kai-shek's counterattack on the Yigou and Zhaicun line on the night of the 10th, a portion of the 40th Division and reactionary armed forces such as the puppet security regiment and "Homecoming Corps" entrenched in Liuhegou, Shuiye, Lunzhang, Luxian, etc., fled in panic toward Anyang on the 11th, and the aforementioned important towns were liberated. The People's Liberation Army is currently taking advantage of the victory to besiege the Liu Lexian division of the puppet Henan Third Special District Security Regiment in Xiqugou, an important town between An(yang) and Shui(ye). The area is expected to fall soon.
　　[From Our Reporter on the Northern Henan Front, 13th] After completing new operational deployments, our Northern Henan army actively withdrew from Qixian city on the 7th. The invading enemy's 49th Brigade, the entire 32nd Division, two brigades of the 66th Division, and the 316th Regiment of the 40th Division invaded Qixian on the 7th and continued to advance north along the Pinghan Railway and its sides on the 8th, reaching Yigou Town (more than twenty miles south of Tangyin) on the 10th. They were fiercely attacked by our army, suffering heavy casualties, and began to retreat south on the morning of the 11th. They were ambushed and pursued by the Liberation Army along the way, becoming extremely disheveled, abandoning many corpses, ammunition, and supplies.
　　[Urgent Telegram from Our Reporter on the Tongpu Front, 13th] The Taiyue People's Liberation Army went deep into the enemy's heart south of the Fen River, developing rapidly, and captured the two county towns of Wanquan and Ronghe on the 11th and 12th. All of the defending enemy forces, numbering over a thousand men, were annihilated. The results of the battle are numerous and are being tallied. These are the seventh and eighth county towns liberated during the Jin-nan campaign.
