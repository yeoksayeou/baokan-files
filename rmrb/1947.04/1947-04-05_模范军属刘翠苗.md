　　Model Military Family Member Liu Cuimiao
    Yong Jin
    Liu Cuimiao lost her mother at the age of eleven and suffered abuse from her stepmother. At twenty-two, she married into Nanliuzhuang (Jixian County). Her impoverished life made her aware of the evils of the old society. After the incident, her mother-in-law died, leaving only her father-in-law, husband, and two daughters. In 1942, she encouraged her husband to join a certain corps in Central Hebei.

    Organizing a Textile Group
    In the winter of 1944, her father-in-law, Wang Kuiju, was elected a labor hero. The following spring, Liu Cuimiao said to the women in the neighborhood: "Just doing housework isn't enough. The grain from the fields isn't enough to eat. Only by doing more textile work can we improve our lives." Then she convened a meeting of the entire women's association, explaining that women must actively engage in production to have status. As a result, twenty-four young women organized themselves into four textile groups, with Liu Cuimiao as the group leader. The cotton was borrowed from the county cooperative, four and a half jin of raw cotton for each bolt of cloth (two jin in weight). In one spring, they wove fifty bolts of cloth. Because the group worked together when spinning cotton, they saved about sixty jin of oil in one spring. When they settled accounts in the spring, the textile group received a total of 3,600 jin of rice, with each person receiving 150 jin of rice. Everyone reflected: "If we didn't have the textile group, how could we get this much rice!"

    Establishing a Cooperative
    The year before last, she founded a cooperative. To make the cooperative more helpful for farming and to accumulate more fertilizer, she first opened a flour mill. The government loaned her 3,700 yuan, and the masses invested seven sacks of grain, and it opened. There were many difficulties at the time. After finding a worker, there were problems with the equipment. Tree root ladles could not be bought, and there was no pot or millstone. The beans were being eaten by insects, and several village cadres suggested selling them to buy sesame paste, and postponing the flour mill. Cuimiao said: "This is about whether we do it or not. I'll guarantee to mobilize a vat first." Because vats were used the most and were the most difficult to obtain. Then the cadres all said they would guarantee to borrow a vat. As a result, the difficulty of establishing the flour mill was overcome. At that time, in addition to serving as the vice chairman of the cooperative, she was also the village deputy, public security director, women's association director, and also led the textile group. Her husband was a soldier in the regiment, her father was a district head in the district, she had twenty-six mu of land, two daughters, she led the village work, and did all the housework herself. The cooperative director, Li Shangnong, was a fifty-year-old demobilized comrade, who was still constantly doing work in the district. The cooperative's affairs all depended on Cuimiao's active leadership. By this year, their cooperative had all seventy-two households in the village, except for ten (mostly those who had been struggled against), who had become shareholders in the cooperative. Now the entire cooperative's capital has grown to more than 800,000 yuan, raising six large pigs and three old sows, and will add at least thirty piglets this spring.

    Leading Large-Scale Work Teams
    During the Great Counteroffensive in 1945, some of the grain in Liuzhuang had not yet been harvested. The young people had all gone to sabotage the Deshi Road. Only the elderly and weak women remained in the village. Liu Cuimiao, in response to the call to plant wheat, convened a meeting of all the women in the village. She said: "The men have all left. If it affects the planting of wheat, we won't be able to 'cultivate three and leave one' next year." Originally, the work teams were all participated in by the whole family, but at this time, with the loss of the main labor force, most people felt helpless, but planting wheat was a common desire. After this suggestion, everyone felt it made sense. More than thirty women and fifteen old men asked to be in the same group as her. Cuimiao accepted everyone's opinions and became the work team leader. At night, the military families came to find her, and the poor peasants also came to find her. She was busy assigning people here and there. In order to increase the strength, she temporarily organized the children to help the military families carry water and solve minor difficulties. She herself was a military family member, but she ensured that another military family member, Kui Fu, had water to drink. Everyone was sent out, and she threshed the grain herself, and was still in the field when it was dark. The old woman next door saw it and was moved by her hardworking spirit, and helped her clean up. In one autumn, her own twenty-six bags of grain were all threshed by herself, and she also helped Kui Fu's family thresh their grain, carrying more than twenty bags of grain. The six-day shock week passed, and the women used carts to pull manure, chop bean stalks, and turn over the soil, working so hard that everyone in the village praised Cuimiao.

    Transforming a Lazy Woman
    Shi Simi, the famous lazy woman in the village, dragged four children and farmed two mu of temple land. In the past, she wouldn't even bother to pick up a stick of firewood. The weeds in the field grew as tall as alfalfa. If she found a few grains of grain, she would buy something to eat or trade it. She would steal grain in the autumn and steal wheat when it was ripe. In 1945, Shi Simi's eldest son went to fight against the Japanese. If she encountered any difficulties she would go to the village office, but her hopes could not be fully satisfied. So she continued to steal. In the village, adults and children did not treat her like a person. But Cuimiao thought: Shi Simi is strong and capable. If she can be transformed, she can do a lot of work. So she mobilized her to participate in the labor. When reviewing the work, Shi Simi did more than the men. After the autumn, Cuimiao said to Shi Simi: "There's no work now, so spin cotton." But Shi Simi didn't have a spinning wheel. Cuimiao gave her one of her own. Simi happily took it and earned one hundred and sixty or seventy jin of rice in the winter. The people in the village all said that Simi had changed.

    A Model in Everything
    In the spring of 1945, the county and district brigades and supply office were stationed in her village. She led all the women in the village to mend clothes and wash socks. She herself made seven pairs of underpants, five short jackets, four padded quilts, and more than twenty pairs of socks. After the autumn, the county and district asked to make cotton vests for the soldiers. The small village of seventy-two households was fully mobilized. During the day, she helped the elderly sew and encouraged the morale of each group. In addition, she worked hard at night. After four days, the whole village completed eight hundred pieces. Cuimiao herself made twenty pieces.

　　模范军属刘翠苗
    勇进
    刘翠苗十一岁丧母，受着继母虐待，二十二岁嫁到南刘庄（冀县），穷苦的生活使她认识了旧社会的罪恶。事变后婆婆死了，只剩下公公、丈夫和两个女孩；四二年动员丈夫参加了冀中某兵团。
    组织纺织组
    四四年冬，她公公王魁聚当选了劳动英雄，次年春刘翠苗向邻家妇女说：“光做家里活可有多少呢，地里的粮食打的不够吃，只有多纺织才能提高生活。”接着她便召开了一个全体妇救会，讲明妇女要积极生产才会有地位，于是二十四个青年妇女组织起来，成立了四个纺织组，组长是刘翠苗。棉花本是县合作社贷给的四斤半穰子，要一个布（二斤重），一春天就织了五十个布。变工纺花时因为一组在一块，一春约计省油六十余斤，春天结账时，纺织组共得米三千六百斤，每人合得米一百五十斤，大家反映说：“咱要没纺织组，那能得这些米呀！”
    创办合作社
    前年她创办了合作社，为了使合作社对种地更有帮助，多积肥，首先开了粉坊，公家贷了三千七百元，群众入股七口袋粮食，便开张了。当时困难是很多的，找到工人后，家具发生了问题，树根瓢买不到，没有锅、没有磨。豆子叫虫子咬了，几个村干提议粜了买芝麻面子，粉坊以后再说。翠苗说：“这是咱干不干的事，我先保证动员一个缸。”因为缸用的最多也最难弄，接着干部们都说保证借一个缸，结果成立粉坊的困难打破了。当时她除了担任合作社副社长外，还是村副、公安主任、妇会主任，又领导纺织组。丈夫在团里当兵，父亲在区里任区长，她有二十六亩地，两个女孩子，她领导着村里工作，家里活完全自己做，合作社长李尚农是一个五十多岁复员的同志，还不断作着区里的工作，合作社的事，全靠翠苗积极领导。她们的合作社到今年，全村七十二户人家，除十家（多是被斗户）外，都成了合作社股东。现在整个合作社资本，已发展到八十余万元，喂着六个大猪、三个老母猪，在今春至少要添三十多个小猪。
    领导大拨工
    四五年大反攻时，刘庄谷子还有的没割，青年们都去破击德石路，村中只剩下老弱妇女。刘翠苗为响应种麦号召，便召集全村妇女开会，她说：“男的都出发了，如果影响种麦，明年就不能耕三余一。”本来拨工组都是全家参加，但这时一失去了主力，一般人都觉得无法可想，可是种麦又是大家共同的要求。经这样一提，人人觉得有理，三十多个妇女和十五个老头，纷纷要求和她在一组，翠苗接受了大家意见，当了拨工队长。晚上军属来找，贫农也找，全村都来找。她忙着给这派人，给那拨工，为了增加力量，她又临时将儿童组织起来，帮助军属抬水与解决零星困难。她自己是个军属，她倒保证另一家军属魁福家有水吃，人都派出去了，她自己打场，天黑了还在场里。邻家的老奶看见了，也为她这种勤劳精神所感动，帮着她收拾。一秋自己二十六布袋粮食，统是个人打场，还帮魁福家打了场，扛完二十多布袋粮。六天突击周过去了，妇女们使车拉粪、砍豆秧、倒楂子，忙成一个，七十多亩（大亩）种麦地收拾停当，村里人人称赞翠苗。
    改造懒老婆
    村里出名的懒老婆石四米拉着四个孩子，种二亩庙地，过去一把柴火都不安心拾，地里的草长得和苜蓿一样高，落几颗粮食她就买着吃、换着吃，秋熟偷秋，麦熟偷麦。四五年石四米的大儿子抗战去，他有点困难就找村公所，但是她的希望那能完全满足呢？所以依旧是偷，在村里大人小孩都拿她不当人。可是翠苗想：石四米身大力不亏，如果转变好了，干活可满行，于是便动员她参加了劳动。检讨工作时，石四米比男人干的还多。过了秋，翠苗对石四米说：“没活了纺花罢”，可是石四米没有纺车。翠苗便把自己的一辆送给她，四米高兴的拿去，一冬赚了一百六、七十斤米，村里人们都说四米转变了。
    处处是模范
    四五年春县区大队和供给处驻在她村，她领导全村妇女补衣裳洗袜子，她自己做了七个裤叉、五个小褂、四床夹被、二十多双袜套。秋后县区叫给战士们做棉坎肩，七十二户的小村，总动员起来，白天她帮老人缝缝，并到各组鼓励情绪；另外个人黑夜赶，四天过去了，全村共完成了八百件，翠苗自己做了二十件。
