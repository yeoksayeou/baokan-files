　　Everyone Take Action to Catch Rats

　　The losses caused by rats are very significant. According to my understanding, some warehouses suffer grain losses of more than five per thousand per month due to rats. The grain losses in people's homes are not yet calculated. At the same time, in order to prevent the spread of plague and other diseases, and to reduce human and livestock mortality, large-scale rat catching is also necessary. But if this is to be effective, it must create a mass movement. Therefore, I suggest:

　　1. Newspapers should encourage everyone to catch rats.

　　2. Health departments at all levels of government should reward places with good rat catching, creating a kind of hygiene movement.

　　3. Promote raising cats and making more mousetraps.

　　4. Exchange one pound of grain for one pound of rats, rewarding the masses for catching large numbers of rats.

　　5. Specifically mobilize women and children to use their spare time to catch rats.

　　Editor's Note: Comrade Tian's suggestion is also a way to economize. It is hoped that various places will pay attention to its implementation, and also hope to introduce effective mousetraps and rat poison, sending letters to this column.

　　大家动手捉老鼠
    老鼠造成的损失，是很大的。据我的了解，有些仓库粮食每月被老鼠吃的要在千分之五以上，群众自己家中粮食损失尚无计算；同时为了防止鼠疫及其他疾病的传染，减少人畜的死亡，大量捕鼠，也是必要的。但这事要想收效，必须造成一个群众性的运动，因此我建议：
    一、报纸应鼓动大家普遍捕鼠。
    二、各级政府卫生部门，应奖励捕鼠好的地方，造成一种卫生运动。
    三、提倡养猫与多做捕鼠器。
    四、用一斤粮食换一斤老鼠，奖励群众大量捕捉。
    五、特别动员妇女、儿童，利用余时来捉。

    编者按：田同志这建议，也是节约的一条，希各地注意实行，并望介绍有效的捕鼠器和杀鼠药，投函本栏。
