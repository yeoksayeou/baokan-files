    Border Region Government and Directly Subordinate Organs
    Cultivate Sixty Mu in a Week
    [Our Newspaper] The Border Region Government personnel and livestock participated in spring plowing in the villages for a week, cultivating more than fifty mu of land, sparking a mass spring plowing upsurge. In recent days, all comrades of the Border Region Government have been competing to join the land cultivation group. Chief Wang, Section Chief Zhao, Director Zhang, and others in their forties have taken the lead. The methods for organizing this work are: (1) After compiling statistics on the land of childless and widowed military dependents without labor, the land is divided into eight areas according to distance, such as "Near Slope" and "Lao Houyao"... Each area is plowed on a specific day, and if it cannot be plowed in one day, it is plowed over two days, instead of by household, which saves people and animals from traveling back and forth. (2) A specific person is designated as the group leader for the day's land cultivation, and reports the land cultivation situation and mass feedback to the club at night. (3) A wall newspaper posts a "Daily Land Cultivation Bulletin, Day ×," promptly announcing achievements and commending models. In the past week, a total of thirty-eight workers and thirty-three head of livestock were used. In the first two days, the masses were busy squeezing out feudal tails. In recent days, they have been plowing simultaneously with the Border Region Government land cultivation group, and the delivery of manure and plowing have become a hot trend. The fields and mountains are filled with a joyful atmosphere of unity between the government and the people. Furthermore, due to the lead taken by the Border Region Government in participating in spring plowing in the villages, the directly subordinate organs of the Border Region Government have also organized people and livestock to join this movement. Units such as the Postal Service General Bureau and the Peace Hospital have already cultivated more than ten mu of land. (Qi Zhi, Xiu Shan)

    边府暨直属各机关
    一周代耕六十余亩
    【本报讯】边府人畜参加驻村春耕一周，耕地五十余亩，带起群众春耕热潮。数日来，边府全体同志，争先恐后，要求参加代耕组，四十多岁的王处长赵科长，张主任等均首起带头。组织这一工作的办法是：（一）将无劳力之孤寡军属土地统计后按地的远近分成“近坡”“老后窑”……等八处，每天在一处犁，一天犁不完两天犁，而不按户，这样省得人畜来回跑路。（二）指定一定的人为当日代耕组长，夜间向俱乐部汇报代耕情形与群众反映。（三）墙报每日张贴代耕第×日快报，及时公布成绩，表扬模范。一周来共用人工三十八个，畜力三十三个。群众前两天正忙于挤封建割尾巴，近几日已纷纷与边府代耕组同时犁地，送粪犁地已走上热潮。田间山野到处洋溢着政民团结的愉快情绪。又：边府直属机关，由于边府的带头参加驻村春耕，也已先后组织人畜投入这一运动。邮政总局、和平医院等单位，已耕地十余亩。（奇之、秀山）
