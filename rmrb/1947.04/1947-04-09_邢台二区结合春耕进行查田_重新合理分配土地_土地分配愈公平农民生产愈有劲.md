　　Xingtai Second District Combines Spring Plowing with Land Survey
  　Re-distributing Land Rationally
  　The More Equitable the Land Distribution, the More Motivated the Farmers are to Produce
    [Report from our newspaper in Xingtai] The Second District, combining spring plowing and production, is conducting land distribution inspections and has found that unfair land distribution is affecting farmer morale. The most significant problems currently are: First, cadres, activists, and those who are eloquent have tended to receive more land, while honest farmers receive less or worse land. In some villages, a small number of people have a vast amount of land, while in others, the unfairness is widespread. Zhang Fengsheng, chairman of the Zhangjiazhuang Farmers' Association, has been allocated 22 mu of good land for his family of three, while the average poor peasant in the village only has four or five mu of irrigated and dry land per person. Wang Yulong, a cadre in Xidashu, has been allocated 19 mu of good land for his family of two, while the average person in the village can only average two or three mu of land. Xue Bao, an extremely poor person in Dongshi Village, still lives in a dilapidated temple, "without a single room or a single plot of land." Liu Jichun and six other extremely poor households in Dongdashu, totaling sixteen people, have no house and no land. Li Xiaofu and twenty-three other poor peasant households only have a few mu of bad land. Over 200 mu of temple land in the village have not yet been distributed, and the feudal landlord Tian Yukun has been allocated over 12 mu of good land. The main reason for this situation is that the principle of filling gaps was not followed in the repeated struggles and distributions; whoever wanted land was given it. Honest farmers were slow to become aware and afraid to ask, and by the time they realized and dared to ask, there was no good land left. In addition, the distribution of spoils based on problems during the past anti-奸 [anti-traitor] rent reduction campaign, and the recent re-examination that focused only on storming backward villages while relaxing efforts in general villages, have also affected the rational distribution of land. Second, landlords still retain a large amount of good land. Some village cadres are deceived by feudal landlords, suppress the masses, deceive their superiors, and protect the landlords' land. In Taiping Village, seven targets of struggle all retain 20 to 30 mu of good land; the landlord Zhao Tang has more than 60 mu of land but only gave up half. In Dongdashu, eighteen landlord and feudal rich peasant households have not been touched at all, still retaining 511 mu of good land, averaging over 22 mu per person. The landlord Song Xueshi had more than 61 mu of land but falsely reported 31 mu. Third, land ownership has not been determined. The landlord Zhang Laomei of Zhangjiazhuang rented and pawned 36 mu of land to other villages; it was not struggled against in this village, and the other villages did not return the dead contracts. In Dongdashu, the landlord's 145 mu of land outside the village has not had its ownership changed. Fourth, landlords use "backward" peasants to hide their wealth and grain. In Dongshi Village, it was discovered that the target of struggle Wang Erzhong had hidden eleven sacks of wheat. The target of struggle in Pangma Village is still working as a director in the cooperative. The masses reflect: "We took out the money and let the target of struggle be the boss!" Luo Fengwu of Xinchang Village is a well-known big bad gentry. After being struggled against, he sent his adopted son to join the army and took the opportunity to pull back three large carts (of clothes, grain, and furniture), more than he originally had. The masses reflect: "The target of struggle is skillful, he recovered his capital and made a profit." In addition, some landlords want to "counterattack"; Li Dujing, a landlord in Xuejiatun, was struggled against last year and this year went back to plant poplar trees in the land that had been distributed to the peasants. Based on the above situation, the first step is to break the cadres' complacency and resistance to the idea of filling gaps, to inspire cadres' class consciousness, using the concrete examples of poor masses who have not turned over, combined with education, to call on cadres to perform meritorious service for the people: "Helping one more poor person to turn over is one more achievement." The second step is to mobilize the enthusiasm of all peasants for land distribution, "No land, no time," "Bad land, bad time, little land, little time." Each village should set standards, distribute them street by street, household by household, and use small group meetings and other forms to launch a "compare time, compare land" campaign. In this way, problems will be thoroughly exposed. The third step is how to achieve fairness and rationality, and the method will vary depending on the situation. Xin Zhuang, Sanyi Temple, Zhangjia Zhuang and other villages adopted the method of small land adjustments and voluntary exchange. In these villages, the situation is that a small number of people have good land, bad land, much land, and little land, uneven distribution, most of the disparity is not great. For example, in Sanyi Temple there are many tenants. During the rent reduction, the bold ones reduced the good land to their hands, and the honest people were afraid to make trouble. When the unified distribution was carried out in the Great Struggle, those who dared to ask were given good land, and those who were aware of it later were left with bad land, resulting in an uneven distribution of good and bad land. The whole village adopted the method of opening up ideas, mobilizing households that exceeded the standard to voluntarily withdraw and fill the number of households that did not meet the standard, in order to achieve a balanced turn-over in the whole village. The chairman of the Zhangjiazhuang Farmers Association divided six or seven mu of good land, and the director of the Armed Forces Committee also demanded five or six mu of land, voluntarily withdrew and filled five or six households. Sun Gengxing, a military family member in Xinzhuang, had more than 20 mu of bad hill land for his family of five, and the village exchanged it for 13 mu of garden land and 6 mu of dry land. Sun Kuilin had more than 30 mu of bad sandy land, and the village extracted 20 mu of bad sandy land and exchanged it for 11 mu of good land, and the output doubled. Before returning the land, the thinking must be clarified and both parties must be satisfied. Taiping, Dongdashu, Xu Wangtun and other villages adopted the method of continuing to investigate feudalism and filling the loopholes, because in these villages the landlords kept a lot of good land and the poor did not get the land. Poor villages such as Fengyu and Wujiaqiao adopted the method of rich villages donating land to solve the land problem. Chenjiatun donated 50 mu of land to Fengyu Village, and Da Lü donated 50 mu to Wujiaqiao. Zhangjiazhuang’s more than 30 mu of local land in other villages became dead contracts that were not withdrawn. Poor villages could withdraw or exchange contracts in rich villages, while rich villages in poor villages did not withdraw and changed to dead contracts. As a result, the poor villages reflected: "It's really done that farmers all over the world are one family." Finally, it is necessary to implement the fundamental education of land for prosperity. This requires solving the three basic ideas of the peasants: First, from the relationship of class exploitation, let the peasants realize that without land, it is the root of exploitation and suffering. Landlords control the land, which is a weapon to exploit and oppress the peasants. The second is to solve who is the owner of the land. The peasants realize that they are the owners of the land, and the landlords are the hegemons of the land, solving the idea that wanting land is a just action. Third, it is necessary to solve the problem that land is the capital for peasants to produce and prosper, and only with land can there be time. With the solution of these three ideas, the masses dare to actively demand the solution of the land problem. The honest peasants reflected: "In the past, my thinking was not clear, and I lost out by not wanting land. Now that I have figured it out, I can get a good distribution!" At first, the masses in Changxin Village were unwilling to develop, and no one wanted 200 mu of land. After the education of production and prosperity, the masses' enthusiasm for land increased. The masses in Zhangjiatun were originally not prepared to put much effort into the land, and prepared to turn the water land into dry land. After mobilization, after thinking through the problem, they actively discussed mutual assistance issues, increasing livestock, cultivating land for others, delivering manure, hoeing wheat and other activities, which have all started one after another.

　　邢台二区结合春耕进行查田
  　重新合理分配土地
  　土地分配愈公平农民生产愈有劲
    【本报邢台讯】二区结合春耕生产，进行土地分配检查，发现土地分配不公，影响农民生产情绪。目前最主要的有以下问题：一、干部积极分子和能说会道的人，有多得土地现象，老实农民得的少而歹，有的村是少数人土地悬殊，有的村则是普遍不公。张家庄农会主席张丰声，三口人分好地廿二亩，村内一般贫农平均每人只四、五亩水旱地。西大树干部王玉龙，二口人分好地十九亩，全村每人一般只能平均二、三亩地。东石村赤贫雪宝至今仍住破庙，“房无一间，地无一垅”。东大树赤贫刘计春等七户，十六人，没房、没地，贫农李小福等廿三户只有几亩坏地。该村有二百多亩庙地尚未分配，封建地主田玉琨反分到十二亩多好地。检查原因，主要是在屡斗屡分中没掌握填补原则，谁要就分给谁。老实农民觉悟迟、不敢要，等觉悟了，敢要了，又没好地；此外过去反奸减租中有一段按问题分果实，及最近一段复查中，又只注意了突击落后村，而放松一般村，亦因而影响了土地合理分配。二、地主仍保存有大量好地，有些村干部为封建地主所蒙蔽，压制群众，瞒哄上级，为地主掩护土地。太平村七个斗争对象都保有二三十亩好地；地主赵堂有六十多亩地，只拿出一半。东大树有十八户地主、封建富农根本没动，尚留有五百一十一亩好地，每人平均廿二亩多。地主宋学诗有六十一亩多地，便假装出三十一亩。三、土地所有权没有确定，张家庄地主张老美租、当给外村三十六亩地，本村未斗，外村也没归死契。东大树地主外当地一百四十五亩多，也没变动所有权。四、地主利用“落后”农民隐藏资财粮食。东石村查出斗争对象王二中隐蔽十一布袋麦子。庞马斗争对象仍在合作社干事，群众反映：“咱拿出钱，叫斗争对象当掌柜哩！”心长村骆凤梧是有名大劣绅，被斗后，送义子参军，乘机拉回三大车（衣服、粮食、家具）果实，比他原来东西还多，群众反映：“斗争对象手腕高，捞回本赚了利。”此外还有的地主想“反攻”；薛家屯地主李笃敬去年被斗争，今年又到已分给农民的地里栽杨树。依据以上情况，首先是打破干部的自满与抵抗填补的思想，启发干部阶级自觉，以贫苦群众未翻身的具体事例，结合教育，号召干部为人民立功：“多帮助一个穷人翻身，就多一个功劳。”其次是发动全体农民对土地分配的积极性，“没土地，没时光”，“土地坏，时光歹，土地少，时光小。”各村规定标准，分街挨户，用小组大会等形式展开：“比时光比土地”。这样问题就会彻底暴露出来，再次是怎样做到公平合理问题，根据情况不同，办法也不一样。辛庄、三义庙、张家庄等村采取了土地小调与自动愿兑换的办法，这类村情形是少数人中地好、地坏，地多、地少分配不均，大多数悬殊不大。如三义庙佃户多，减租时胆大的都把好地减到手，老实人不敢闹，等到大斗争统一分配时，又是敢要的分上了好地，觉悟晚的剩下坏地，形成好坏地不匀现象。全村采取打通思想，动员超过标准的户，自愿退出来填补不够标准的数，求得全村翻身平衡。张家庄农会主席多分六、七亩好地，武委会主任也多要五、六亩地，自愿退出填补了五、六户。辛庄军属孙耿兴五口人，有廿多亩坏岗地，村上给兑换成十三亩园地，六亩旱地。孙魁林有三十多亩坏沙地，村上给他抽出二十亩坏沙地，兑换成十一亩好地，产量增加一倍。退地之前，必须思想弄通，双方满意才行。太平、东大树、徐王屯等村是采取继续追查封建、填补窟窿的办法，因这些村情形是地主保存大量好地，穷人没分上地。丰裕、武家桥等穷村，是采取富村赠田办法解决土地问题。陈家屯赠给丰裕村五十亩地，大吕赠送武家桥五十亩。张家庄在外村当地卅多亩变成死契不抽回，穷村在富村当契可抽可兑换，富村在穷村不抽变死契，这样一来，穷村反映：“真做到天下农民是一家。”最后还须贯彻土地是根本的发家教育。这就要解决农民三个基本思想：一是从阶级剥削关系上，让农民认识，没有土地，是受剥削受痛苦的根源，地主掌握土地，是剥削压迫农民的武器。二是要解决谁是土地的主人。农民认识了自己是土地的主人，地主是土地的霸主，解决要土地是正义行动的思想。三、要解决土地是农民生产发家的本钱，有了土地才有时光。随着这三个思想解决，群众才敢积极要求解决土地问题，老实农民反映：“过去思想不通，不要土地吃了亏，这时想通可得分配好哩！”长信村群众起初因为不愿发展，二百亩地没人要，经过生产发家教育，群众要地劲头才大了。张家屯原来群众对地不准备多下功，准备变水地为旱地，经动员弄通思想后，积极讨论互助问题，增牲口、代耕、送粪、锄麦等各种活动，均先后开始。（子平）
