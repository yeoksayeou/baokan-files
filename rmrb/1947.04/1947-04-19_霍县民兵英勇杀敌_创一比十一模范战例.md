　　Heroic Militiamen of Huo County Kill the Enemy
    Creating a Model Battle with a Ratio of One to Eleven
    [Our Newspaper Reports] Since Huo County armed its village governments, the militia guerrilla forces have become even more active, responding to the call to "Defend Chairman Mao" with practical actions of vigorously killing the enemy. In seven days, they killed or wounded 33 enemy soldiers, from deputy regimental commander and company commander down. According to a report from the county headquarters: On the 19th of last month, the Yan-puppet army's 69th Division, 207th Regiment, with more than 500 soldiers, and more than 300 local bandits, totaling about 800 men, advanced on Duanzhuang Village in the Fifth District in two routes. The village militia, under the leadership of the hero Zhang Genba, were prepared. When one enemy route entered the north of the village, they fell into a minefield. With a bang, four were wounded. The other route engaged in a fierce battle with our militia for over an hour. The enemy suffered seven dead and wounded, gained nothing, and fled back to the city in disgrace. On the 22nd, the enemy concentrated about 500 men, about one regiment, and attacked in three routes, coming to Jinbi Village to loot grain, and attempting to encircle our Xialeping militia. The village militia, under the leadership of Director Shen, resisted from the walls and bunkers. They also sent two groups to ambush in the riverbed. District Director Guo Yide led the militia and a platoon from the Fen River Detachment to fight on the Qinglangping walls. The hero Zhang Shao quickly laid two mines on the enemy's route of attack, immediately killing one enemy soldier. Militias from Shangleping, Jiacun, Yangshi Village, and other places also rushed to support upon hearing the alarm. Under our joint defense and encirclement, several enemy soldiers, including a deputy regimental commander and company commander, were killed. In the afternoon, the enemy could not withstand it and collapsed. At the same time, one enemy route went to Jinbi Village to loot grain. The militias of Jinbi, Beihou, Beizhang, and Duzhuang Villages heroically charged, wounding five enemy soldiers and seizing back seven or eight *shi* of grain. When the enemy entered the village, the village cadres led the masses to evacuate to the mountains, and still organized the gathering of firewood and carried out land reform. On the 25th, the enemy blatantly looted grain. Our First Detachment used a burst of machine-gun fire to wound four enemy soldiers. The militia had pre-emptively laid mines on the Xizhang and Jiameng walls which exploded (the number of enemy dead and wounded is unknown). The Beihou militia also wounded two enemy soldiers. The militia of the Fourth District saw that the enemies in Baishan dared not come out of the bunkers, and surrounded them with mines. After everyone discussed it, they secretly laid two mines at night where the enemy had laid mines. On the 22nd, when the enemy came out to collect the mines during the day, they stepped on them, killing one on the spot and seriously wounding another. In the above battles, we only suffered three casualties, with the ratio of enemy to our casualties being eleven to one.
    [Our Newspaper Taiyue Dispatch, 17th] The campaign for militiamen in Yuebei's Pingyao, Jiexiu, Lingshi, Huo County, and Zhao County to eliminate the enemy and achieve meritorious service is vigorously unfolding. According to incomplete statistics, 135 Chiang-Yan soldiers, from deputy company commander down, have been killed, wounded, or captured. Since the heroic sacrifice of eight comrades, including Li Mingfu, in the Yuanchuan battle in Zhao County, the two counties have launched a revenge campaign. At the revenge meeting in the Third District on March 21st, Gao Huida's combat team, the hero Zhang Qikui, and 88 other militiamen and heroes launched a competition to eliminate 154 enemies. They said, "Rather be a hero than a weak soldier." After the meeting, everyone immediately went deep into the enemy's rear. The hero Zhang Qikui's combat team killed or captured 18 enemy soldiers on the Hongzhao Highway in seven days. By the end of March, the county militia had eliminated 36 enemy soldiers. Lingshi specially decided that "March to April is a month of meritorious service campaign" and commended the militiamen who had performed meritorious service. After Pingyao convened a meeting of guerrilla platoons, companies, and battalions on March 10th, everyone also challenged each other, guaranteeing to kill 89 enemies in one month. The Fourth District has launched a fierce battle. The minefields in the Beizegou area killed or wounded 14 enemy soldiers in one day on the 3rd of this month. On the 17th of last month, the militia, in coordination with the guerrilla battalion, killed or wounded a total of 39 enemy soldiers in the battles of Nanyirun, Youhu, and Zhaobi. Huo County carried out five major and minor operations from March 19th to 25th, killing 36 enemy soldiers, including company commanders. Enemies at the Baishan stronghold in the Fourth District, in order to prevent our attacks, had laid mines around them. However, our militiamen Youfu and Bao Ying used the method of "using mines to control mines", laying more mines near the enemy's mines. As a result, they blew up two enemy soldiers. Jiexiu also ambushed the enemy twice in Zhangyuan and other places on March 20th and 25th, killing ten enemy soldiers and capturing one machine gun and four rifles.
