    Border Region Relief Association Cables Edgerton
    Protesting Chiang's Detention of Relief Supplies
    Demanding UNRRA Take Effective Measures to Stop It
    [This newspaper special dispatch] The Relief Association of the Liberated Areas of China, Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region Branch, sent a cable to General Edgerton, Director of the UNRRA Shanghai Office, on the 18th. It requested the office to take effective measures for the distribution of relief supplies in the liberated areas, and protested the Kuomintang's barbaric behavior of preventing relief supplies from entering the liberated areas. The original cable stated:
    Comrade Wu Yunfu, Shanghai, forwarded to General Edgerton, UNRRA Shanghai Office:
    Just as the Executive Yuan of the Kuomintang, through the central government, has been extensively publicizing to China and foreign countries that "the relief supplies shipped to the Communist areas in February and March have exceeded 20,000 tons" and "the office will continue to ship supplies to the Communist areas in the future," the Chiang's army in Cangxian, Jinan, detained a batch of small amount of relief supplies that had just begun to be transported to our region and the adjacent liberated areas, along with transportation vehicles and civilian ships! This proves the true situation of where the relief supplies claimed by the Executive Yuan to be "shipped to the Communist areas" are now. How much of the "20,000 tons" claimed by the Executive Yuan has actually been shipped to the liberated areas? Which liberated area? The Executive Yuan should announce it clearly. We request your office to take effective measures immediately to protest against the continuous and planned barbaric acts of the Kuomintang to prevent relief supplies from entering the liberated areas. Regarding the distribution of relief supplies, we have always been subjected to extremely unfair and unreasonable treatment. The small amount of things we have received has been bombed and destroyed by the Kuomintang army. If UNRRA intends to make real improvements to the past relief situation, in addition to allocating more supplies to the liberated areas, it must also effectively stop the barbaric actions of the Kuomintang government and its army in hindering transportation and detaining supplies, based on the articles of the agreement. Time is pressing, awaiting reply. Please convey our gratitude to the many staff members of your office who are enthusiastic about working hard for the people of the liberated areas.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 16th] A report in the Wenhui Daily on March 19th quoted the 23rd quarterly report of the US Congress as saying that the amount of US Lend-Lease supplies allocated to the Chiang government from September 2, 1945, to September 30, 1946, after the Japanese surrender was $694,263,000. This figure is more than that allocated to any other country during the same period, and only $176,192,000 less than the total amount allocated to the Chiang government in the entire four years from May 11, 1941, to September 2, 1945, before the Japanese surrender.

    边区救济分会电艾格顿
    抗议蒋方扣留救济品
    要求联总作有效制止
    【本报特讯】中国解放区救济会晋冀鲁豫边区分会，十八日致电联总上海分署署长艾格顿将军。要求该署对分配解放区救济物资采取有效措置，并抗议国民党阻止救济物资运入解放区的横暴行为，原电称：
    上海伍云甫同志转联总上海分署艾格顿将军鉴：
    正当国民党行总通过中央一向中外大肆宣传“二三两月内运往中共区域之救济物资已超过二万吨以上”及“今后本署仍将继续以物资运予中共区”的时候，在津南沧县之蒋军把刚才开始运来本区及邻接解放区的一批数量不大的救济物资连运输汽车和民船都扣留了！这证明着行总所声称的“运往中共区域”救济物资现在何处的真实情况。行总所称“二万吨”究竟已运到解放区多少？在那个解放区？应请行总明白宣布。我们要求贵署迅采有效措置，抗议国民党接连不断的有计划的阻止救济物资运进解放区的横暴行为。关于救济物资之分配，我们一直是遭受着极端不公平不合理的待遇，已得到的为量不多的东西，且更受到国民党军队之轰炸与毁坏。如果联总对过去救济情况企图确实有所改进，则除应更多的分配解放区的物资外，还必须对国民党政府及其军队种种阻难运输、扣留物资的横暴行动援据约章有效的加以制止。时间迫切，伫候回音。对为解放区人民而热心流汗奔走的多位贵署人员，请转致我们的谢意。
    【新华社华中十六日电】三月十九日文汇报讯：据美国国会第二十三次季报所公布美国租借物资的分配情形，自日本投降后一九四五年九月二日至一九四六年九月三十日，蒋政府所分配得的数量为六九四二六三○○○美元。此数字较同时期所分配得的任何一国为多，较蒋政府在日本投降前一九四一年五月十一日至一九四五年九月二日整整四年中所分配得的总数，亦仅差一七六一九二○○○美元。
