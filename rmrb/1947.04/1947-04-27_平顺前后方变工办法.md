　　Ping Shun's Method for Changing Work Before and After the Front
    ·Fu Zhou, Ju Lin·
    In order to solve the contradiction between supporting the war effort and the great production movement, Ping Shun convened a meeting of district chiefs and secretaries of various agencies on April 8. After more than a day of discussion, based on the masses' years of experience in changing work and the current needs, the following methods were determined:
    (1) Expand the scope of labor service burden. According to the county's labor force calculation, among more than 21,000 laborers, a total of 9,621 people are serving in the military and have left production. The actual number of laborers bearing labor service is only 11,388. In this way, each laborer has already planted an average of 22 mu of land (actually, only 10 to 15 mu can be planted). With the addition of war support, the labor force is even more lacking, greatly affecting mass production. Therefore, according to the specific situation, five categories were divided: labor service, exemption from labor service, reduction of labor service, provision of labor service, and payment of labor service price without providing labor service. Those who perform labor service are not divided into grades. Village cadres, merchants, public stores and agency production personnel, and cooperative cadres and workers with a dividend salary system all provide labor service. Those exempt from labor service are divided into seven grades: including veterans, cadres who have left production (including county and district cooperative supply system personnel), teachers, and students above junior high school. Reduction of labor service includes demobilized soldiers, patients, and women before and after childbirth. Iron, wood, stone, and mud workers are all treated as labor service. For example, workers in apprenticeship serve 60 percent of the time, and ordinary workers serve 80 percent. Men of age, livestock, and livestock of village cadres' cooperatives all provide labor service. Dividend cadres, workers, and miscellaneous personnel of cooperatives, all personnel of public stores (excluding those on supply system), and merchants, generally only pay the labor service price and do not provide labor service. Sheep workers and hired workers only pay half. This approach does not affect the occupation of each person and also expands the area of labor service burden, so that some people are not burdened too heavily.
    (2) Uniform work conversion throughout the county.
    1. Work evaluation standards: A man who walks a long distance and can carry 60 jin is counted as one full labor force; livestock carrying 80-90 jin is counted as one animal force; women and light labor teams are evaluated according to the above standards. After the labor force is evaluated, labor service, war support, and substitute farming are all shared equally according to the evaluated scores.
    2. Method for converting work before and after the front: All personnel going out to support the war (regardless of militia stretcher transport teams) are calculated by the day. Those who eat their own food receive 10 points, and those who eat public food receive 6 points (one day counts as one day). To reward war support personnel, 2 work points are awarded per day, i.e., 12 points for eating their own food and 8 points for eating public food. Mutual aid teams farming at home receive 10 points for returning labor and 6 points for food. A person carrying 60 jin back and forth 60 li receives 10 points; a donkey or cow carrying 120 jin back and forth 60 li receives 10 points (cows are limited to short trips within 30 li); a mule carrying 180 jin back and forth 60 li receives 20 points; a person driving one animal receives 5 points per day, driving two animals or driving one animal carrying 30 jin of grain receives 10 points; a cart carrying 300 jin back and forth 50 li receives 15 points, and the car attendant receives 10 points; substitute farming is calculated according to the labor force's number in the mutual aid team. Organize semi-laborers (children, old men) who are not of labor service age into light labor teams, responsible for delivering letters (except in special circumstances). Delivering letters 10 li round trip receives 1 point, 6 li at night receives 1 point. Militia sending cases for training and cadres receiving training are treated the same as light labor.
    Cadres working in the village and attending meetings do not count. Attending meetings in the district or county, the county uniformly issues meeting tickets. After returning to the village, the points are calculated according to their labor force score in the mutual aid team.
    (3) Unified work change by district:
    In order to balance the burden of service, it was decided to implement a large-scale work change uniformly by district. The district uniformly manages work ticket wages and establishes a monthly reporting system. Each month, the number of war support, labor service, voluntary transport, substitute farming, and sewing work is reported in each village and submitted to the district for control. The village settles accounts once every three months, and calculates the surplus or shortage of wages according to the number of work that each village's labor force should bear and the actual number of work performed. Those with surplus work receive rice, and those with shortage work provide rice.
    (4) The key to changing work:
    According to past experience, the evaluation of work is very important for whether the change of work is done well. If the evaluation is not good, it will cause some people to suffer losses. For example, the labor force evaluation of women should be evaluated according to their general labor (such as weeding, etc.), and it would be too high to evaluate according to sewing, and women would suffer losses. In addition, appropriate people should be found as standards for evaluation, and nearby villages should be allowed to check each other to prevent village-level protectionism.

　　平顺前后方变工办法
    ·服周、巨林·
    平顺为了解决参战支差与大生产运动的矛盾，于四月八日召开区长及各机关秘书会议，经过一天多的讨论，根据群众几年的变工经验与当前的需要，定出如下办法：
    （一）扩大差力负担面。根据全县劳力计算，二万一千多个劳力之中，参军脱离生产之工作人员共达九千六百二十一人，实际负担差役的劳力只有一万一千三百八十八人，这样每个劳力已平均种地二十二亩（实际只能种十亩到十五亩），再加参战，劳力更感缺乏，大大影响群众生产，因此按具体情况分了服差役、免差役、减差役、出差役和摊差价不支差五项。服差役的不分等，村干部、商人、公营商店和机关生产人员及合作社之分红薪金制干部工人等一律支差。免差者分七等：有荣军、脱离生产之干部（包括县区联社供给制者）、教职员、高小以上之学生等。减差包括复员军人、病号及生产前后之妇女，铁木石泥工人均按差处理，如工人在学徒期间按百分之六十服役，一般的按百分之八十。合年龄之男子及牲口和村干部合作社之牲口均出差。合作社之分红干部、工人杂务人员、公营商店之全部人员（供给者不算）、商人，在一般情况下只摊差价不出差，羊工、雇工只按一半摊。这样处理既不影响各个人的职业而且也扩大了差役的负担面积，不致使部分人负担太重。
    （二）全县统一折工。
    １、评工标准：男人走长路能负六○斤折一全劳力，牲口负重八○——九○斤折一畜力，妇女和轻差队均照上列标准评定分数。劳力评定后，支差、参战、代耕均按此评定分数平均负担。
    ２、前后方变工折工办法：凡出外参战人员（不论民兵担架运输队），按天计算，吃自己者十分，吃公家六分（有一天算一天）。为奖励参战人员，每天奖给二分工，即吃自己十二分，吃公家八分。互助组在家种地还工吃自己十分，管饭六分。人负重六十斤往返六○里顶十分，驴及牛负一二○斤往返六○里十分（牛限于三○里以内短差），骡负一八○斤往返六○里二○分，赶牲口一天赶一头牲口者五分，赶二头或赶一头牲口背三○斤粮者十分，车载三○○斤往返五○里十五分，跟车人顶十分，代耕土地按其劳力在互助组内按数计算。组织不合支差年龄之半劳力（小孩、老汉）为轻差队，专负送信之责（特殊情况例外），送信往返走十里顶一分，夜间走六里顶一分，民兵送案受训及干部受训与轻差同。
    干部在村工作开会不算，到区县开会误工由县统一印发会票，回村后按其在互助组内的劳力分数计算顶分。
    （三）以区统一变工：
    为了使役力负担平衡，决定以区为单位统一实行大变工，由区统一工票工资，建立月报制度，每月在各村汇报参战、支差、义运、代耕、缝纫工数填表报区，以便掌握，村上三月结账一次，按各村劳力应负工数及实出工数算出长短工资，长工得米短工出米。
    （四）变工的关键：
    根据以往经验，变工搞好与否，评工非常重要。如评不好就会使部分人吃亏。如妇女劳力评定，应按其一般生活（如拔苗等生活）来评，按缝纫来评就太高，妇女就会吃亏，另外应找适当人作标准，进行评议，并让附近村互相检查，防止村本位。
