Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 8th—Comprehensive reports from Shanghai and Peiping: Domestic and foreign democrats believe that the Northwest People's Liberation Army's voluntary withdrawal from Yan'an last month on the 19th is not a "victory" for Chiang's army, but a pre-determined strategy of the People's Liberation Army. On the 20th, Shanghai's Wenhui Daily pointed out: Yan'an began to evacuate several months ago. The People's Liberation Army's withdrawal from Yan'an was not passive at all; and even the most optimistic people in Chiang's side probably wouldn't say that they have achieved a "decisive victory" by gaining this empty city. A newspaper in Peiping published an editorial entitled "China Will Have No Peaceful Days From Now On," stating: "The National Army" (referring to Chiang's army) entered Yan'an, and there were obviously no major battles between the two sides, and the main force of the Communist army suffered no major losses. The Communist army's abandonment of Yan'an without a fight shows its determination to fight the "National Army" to the end. The newspaper was ordered to suspend publication for three days by the Chiang government for revealing Chiang Kai-shek's determination to carry out the civil war to the end and go to a dead end. In addition, the British Liberal Party's Manchester Guardian commented at the same time that Chiang Hu's army occupied the empty city of Yan'an, stating that Chiang Kai-shek was wrong to think that he could defeat the Communist army with a superior army. If the die-hard faction of the Kuomintang controls the Chinese government for one day, refuses to implement any reforms, and destroys China with its own tyrannical government, the CCP will be able to win the support of the peasants for one day.
Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 8th—According to people coming from Shanghai: The people in the Chiang area are thinking about changing. "If things go on like this, people will be forced to turn to the Communist Party!" This kind of talk has almost become a common saying among the general lower-level salaried class in Shanghai. Chiang's army's middle and lower-ranking officers are ashamed of the civil war. A certain officer wrote to Wenhui Daily saying: "In the past, everyone respected wearing a military uniform, but now people stay away from you when they see you from a distance." In addition, Comrade Chen Boda's book "The Four Big Families of China," although under strict prohibition, is still popular among readers. It is occasionally sold on Shanghai book stalls.

### 中外民主人士看得清楚　主动撤出延安空城乃是我军既定战略

　　中外民主人士看得清楚
  　主动撤出延安空城乃是我军既定战略
    【新华社陕北八日电】综合沪、平消息：中外民主人士对西北人民解放军上月十九日主动撤出延安，咸认为并非蒋军之“胜利”，乃解放军既定之战略。二十日沪文汇报指出：延安在几个月前就开始疏散，人民解放军退出延安，完全不是被动；而蒋军得此空城，就是蒋方最乐观的人恐怕也决不会说已取得“决定性的胜利”。北平一家报纸则以《中国从此无宁日》为题，发表社论称：“国军”（指蒋军）进入延安，双方显无重大战斗，共军主力绝无重大损失。共军不战而放弃延安，是表明决心与“国军”周旋到底。该报因透露蒋介石决心内战到底，走向绝路，曾被蒋政府勒令停刊三日。又英国自由党曼彻斯特导报，于蒋胡军占领延安空城之同时，著文评称：蒋介石认为能以优良之军队击溃共军，实属错误。国民党之顽固派一日控制中国政府，拒绝实行一切改革，而以其自身之虐政摧毁中国，则中共即一日能赢得农民之支持。
    【新华社华中八日电】据新自上海来人谈：蒋区人心思变。“这样下去，逼着人心向共产党啦！”这种话语几已成为上海一般下层薪水阶级的口头禅。蒋军中下级军官均以内战为耻辱，某军官投书文汇报上说：“以前穿了军装人人尊敬，现在人家老远见到就离得远远地。”又陈伯达同志所著的《中国四大家族》一书，虽在严密查禁下，仍风行读者群中，上海书摊上时有出售。
