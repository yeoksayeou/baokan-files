　　Armed Defense of the Yellow River Ferry
    Nan Gou Peasants Defend Their Emancipation
    [Report from This Newspaper in Taiyue, 15th] The peasants of Nan Gou Village, Pinglu, are united and armed to defend the Yellow River ferry and protect the fruits of their emancipation. Nan Gou is one of the Yellow River ferries in the mountainous area of Pinglu. The opposite bank is the Chiang-occupied area. The village is a small one with only eighty-seven households. After land reform, the peasants reclaimed their land from three big landlords. However, the landlords relied on the Chiang army on the opposite bank and constantly attempted to "reverse the settlement" with the peasants. In order to defend the fruits of their emancipation, the peasants rose up to defend themselves, arming themselves to guard the ferry, blocking Chiang's army and annihilating Chiang's special agents. Earlier this month, Chiang's special agent Jia Lao from Henan crossed the river in an attempt to contact the landlord Zhao Hanwen in the village, but was blocked by the armed peasants. Despite the intense machine-gun fire from Chiang's army on the opposite bank, the militiamen fought bravely, sinking the wooden boat and drowning Jia Lao. Guo Yuan, Qi Quan and other national special agents do not dare to act rashly. Chiang's special agents on the opposite bank shouted to the landlord Lu Chao Duan to go over there, but Lu Chao Duan said, "I dare not go over there!" Lu also went to the Farmers' Association to express his feelings, saying, "Today I understand that there is only one way to go with everyone. If there is a second way, let everyone deal with me." Through the victorious armed struggle, the peasants are more united than in the past. They have established the "One Heart Society," and all the peasants stand solemnly and swear: In order to defend the fruits of emancipation, everyone is of one heart and we will fight the reactionaries to the end. The whole village ate a pot of rice called "One Heart Rice." In the atmosphere of unity against the enemy, there are very few disputes among the peasants. If some individuals quarrel over trivial matters, everyone will say, "Have you forgotten eating One Heart Rice?!"

　　武装坚守黄河渡口
    南沟农民保卫翻身
    【本报太岳十五日电】平陆南沟村农民大团结，武装守卫黄河渡口，保卫翻身果实。南沟是平陆山地的黄河渡口之一，对岸即蒋占区，该村是八十七户的小村，经过土地改革，农民从三户大地主手中收回了自己的土地。但地主们依仗对岸蒋军，时时企图向农民“倒算”。农民为保卫翻身果实，便起而自卫，武装把守渡口，堵击蒋军与歼灭蒋特。本月初，河南蒋特贾牢曾渡河企图与该村地主赵汉文联系，被农民武装堵击，虽在对岸蒋军密集的机枪扫射下，民兵仍英勇奋战，击沉木船，淹死贾牢。郭原、七泉一带之国特亦不敢轻易活动。河对岸蒋特喊话叫地主陆朝端过去，陆朝端说：“我不敢过去呀！”陆并到农会去表白心思，说：“今天我看明白了只有和大家走一条路，若有第二条，任大家处理。”农民经过胜利的武装斗争，较过去更加团结。成立了“一心会”，全体农民肃立宣誓：为保卫翻身果实，大家一条心，要与反动派斗争到底。全村吃了一锅饭叫作“一心饭”，在团结对敌的气氛中，农民间很少纠纷，偶有个别人因小事而争吵，大家便说：“你倒忘了吃一心饭啦？！”
