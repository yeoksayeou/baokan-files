Strive for Victory in the Counter-Offensive and Defend the Fruits of Labor
    Yixing Coal Mine Workers Join the Army

    [Our Newspaper] Twelve workers from the Yixing Coal Mine in Neiqiu voluntarily joined the army. On March 13th, at a farewell meeting with the masses of the entire village and all the mine workers, they expressed their firm confidence in serving the people, defeating Chiang Kai-shek's offensive, and striving for victory in the counter-offensive. Worker Li Yude said: "In the past, when working, we were exploited and oppressed by capitalists every day, not eating enough or wearing enough, and if things weren't right, we would be beaten. After the Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army came, they led the workers to stand up, improved the treatment of workers. We just gained happiness, and the reactionaries want to come and seize our fruits. In order to defend the fruits of victory, after I join the army, I will never return until I defeat the reactionaries." Shi Wen said: "After we leave, we hope that the people of the whole village and all the miners will work hard to produce, complete the Great Production Movement called for by Chairman Mao, and strive to support the front and defeat the reactionaries." Li Wenfeng was not accepted by the government due to his young age, but he insisted on going, saying: "Although I am young now, I will grow up in a year or two. I want to go and fight Chiang Kai-shek, the traitorous bandit, defend our liberated area, and defend the fruits of our liberation." The masses of the whole village and all the mine workers said to the workers who joined the army: After you join the army, don't worry about the affairs at home, we will be responsible for them, and we guarantee that your families will not have any difficulties.

　　争取反攻胜利保卫果实
    益兴煤矿工人参军
    【本报讯】内邱益兴煤矿工人十二名自动参军。三月十三日，全村群众与全矿工人的欢送会上，他们都表示出坚决为人民服务、打垮蒋介石的进攻争取反攻胜利的信心。工人李玉德说：“在过去作工每天受资本家剥削压迫，吃不饱穿不暖，一时不好，就要挨打。共产党八路军来到后，领导工人翻了身，提高了工人待遇，刚才得了幸福，反动派又要来夺取我们的果实。为了保卫胜利果实，我参军后不打垮反动派决不回来。”史文说：“我们走后，希望全村人民、全矿工友努力生产，完成毛主席号召的大生产运动，为支援前线打垮反动派而奋斗。”李文峰因年龄小，到政府没有验上，他坚决要去，说：“我现在虽小，有一、二年就长大了。我要去打蒋介石卖国贼，保卫我们的解放区，保卫翻身果实。”全村群众和全矿职工对参军工人说：你们参军后，家中的事情不用挂念，有我们来负责，保证不使家属困难。
