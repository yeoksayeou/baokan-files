The Story of the Zhao Chuan Guerrilla Unit

Taking the enemy by surprise, the Zhao Chuan Guerrilla Unit launched a disguised attack and took care of the E’shi Second District Public Office. Late at night, they transferred twenty-nine prisoners, including the stubborn District Chief Zhang Lufu, to a temple outside Luo Village, about thirty miles from the city.

The next day at dawn, Comrade Zhao Chuan woke up all the team members and said, "In Luo Village, we must expose our target. Before attracting the enemy here, we must eat and move to another place."

Immediately, everyone put on the clothes of the Eighth Route Army and entered the village neatly, looking for pots to cook rice. The people near Luo Village, hearing that the Zhao Chuan Guerrilla Unit had come to the village, happily busied themselves slaughtering pigs and sheep to慰劳 (weilao: express sympathy and solicitude to/ present gifts to) them. In the afternoon, when the wine and meat were ready and they were about to start eating, a scout hurriedly reported a message saying, "Last night, the enemy gathered parts of the 'Love the Homeland Corps' from five counties: Anyi, Linjin, Yonghe, Wanquan, and E’shi, to jointly attack our guerrilla unit. They are not far from the village now."

Comrade Zhao Chuan calmly said to everyone, "This meal of meat must be eaten here before we leave. Now, immediately assemble and prepare for battle!" After he had arranged everything, the enemy was already firing guns and cannons at Luo Village from all directions. In the southwest corner, the shooting was fiercest. Zhao Chuan ordered the small artilleryman Liu Fusheng to fire a cannon shell first to test the enemy's courage. After the shell was fired, the E’shi "Love the Homeland Corps" retreated. Zhao Chuan recognized the enemy's strength, and after a fierce battle, he pushed back the enemies on the north and south sides. Just as the surrounding gunfire subsided, Zhao Chuan's men changed their attire, disguised as the Chiang Kai-shek army. The enemy in the northwest corner thought that their own people had entered the village and told them not to shoot anymore. A dozen stubborn soldiers coming from the trench in the west couldn't figure out the situation. Just as they were about to retreat, five young and brave guerrilla fighters chased after them, killing five, and taking the others as prisoners.

Three hours later, the guerrilla fighters were still guessing fingers and drinking in Luo Village, while the enemy had already retreated. Under the lamplight, an old man in a long robe came in and said, "There are five people outside who want to contact you. Can I let them in?" Zhao Chuan had Instructor Zhang and Captain Han lead seven or eight people around behind these people. After asking about their origins, Captain Han pretended to be "one of their own." With just a few words, he quietly "received" the Wanquan County magistrate's guards and four detectives. The "gifts" they brought were five rifles and one Mauser pistol.

That night, they changed back into the clothes of the Eighth Route Army and moved their base again.

　　赵川游击队的故事
    趁着敌人措手不及的时候，赵川游击队伪装袭击，解决了猗氏二区区公所。深夜，带着顽区长张履福以下二十九个俘虏，转移到距城三十里路的罗村村外的庙里。
    第二天拂晓，赵川同志叫醒来全体队员说：“在罗村我们要暴露一下目标，等把敌人吸引到这里来以前，我们一定要吃罢饭，转移到别个地方去。”
    立即大家穿上了八路军的衣服，整整齐齐进了村子，找锅煮饭。罗村附近的老百姓听说赵川游击队来村，喜的忙着杀猪宰羊，来慰劳他们。午后酒肉齐备，正要开饭，侦察员急忙忙的来报告了一个消息说：“昨天夜里敌人集结安邑、临晋、永和、万泉、猗氏五个县的‘爱乡团’各一部来合击咱们的游击队，现在离村不远。”
    赵川同志镇定的对大家说：“这顿肉非在这里吃了不走，现在马上集合准备战斗！”他把一切按排好了，敌人已从四面八方向罗村发射枪炮了。西南角上，枪击响的最凶，赵川命令小炮手刘福胜先发一个炮弹试探试探敌人的胆量如何。弹发后，猗氏“爱乡团”向后撤了。赵川识破了敌人的力量，一阵热烈的战斗，把南北两面的敌人也都压了回去。就在周围的枪声沉寂的时候，赵川的人换了装饰，扮成了蒋家军的模样，西北角的敌人以为是自己人已经进了村，招呼别再打枪了。正西凹壕里过来的十几个顽军摸不清情况，正想退回，五位青年勇敢的游击队员追过去打死五个人，另外几个人也作了俘虏。
    三小时之后，游击队员们仍在罗村猜拳饮酒，敌人早都退走了。灯火下有一个穿长袍子的老百姓进来说：“外边有五个人要和你们连络一下，可以让他进来吗？”赵川让张教导员和韩队长带了七八个人迂回到这几个来人背后，问明来历，韩队长装出“自家人”的态度，只几句话就把万泉县长的卫士和四个缉查员消停的“接待”进来了。捎来的“礼物”是五支步枪、一支二八盒子。
    当天的夜里，他们才又换上了八路军的衣服，转移了驻地。
