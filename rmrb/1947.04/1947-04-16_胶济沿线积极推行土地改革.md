　　Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 14th: In the newly recovered areas along the Jiaoji Railway line, including Changyi, Weinan (County), Jiaoxian, Gaomi, Pingdu, and Zibo, a vigorous movement of land reform through anti-traitor accusations and grievance airing is unfolding. In Jiao and Gao, over a hundred villages have initially completed land reform, and land is being distributed in over three hundred villages. In Meicun District, Weinan (newly established county), over a thousand people are settling accounts with Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents Fang Shufen and Fang Yuzhen, who murdered thirteen people. In Pingnan and Pingdong (both new counties), the masses in over ten districts have obtained 30,000 mu of land. Anti-bandit and anti-spy struggles are being launched in areas along the railway line. In Qianyu Village, Panlong District, Zichuan, 500 mu of land has been quickly distributed to poor peasants and workers, with each person receiving 1.6 mu. The families of soldiers have all risen to the level of middle peasants. In Boshan Chengguan and over thirty villages in the western suburbs, the masses publicly tried and executed Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents Sun Haishu and Li Xiangzhen, who had brutally murdered seven worker representatives, on the 2nd. That evening, they also reasoned and settled accounts with the tyrannical landlord You Baosen, who had colluded with Chiang Kai-shek's puppet regime to plunder over 200 mu of land from the peasants, and recovered all the land.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 14th: Over 3,300 poor peasants, farm laborers, and workers in the newly recovered Longquan and four other districts in Zichuan have launched a movement against counter-settlement and to eradicate Chiang Kai-shek's roots. On the 26th of last month, over 2,000 workers and peasants in Longquan District beat gongs and drums, spreading the word about turning the tables; they established a land reform committee and arrested hidden Chiang Kai-shek spies. In Panlong District, during the past persistent guerrilla warfare, twelve villages had initially completed land reform with the support of Li Kailu's armed work team. This time, after 496 activists returned to their villages, they went out to help the masses in Luo Family Village and over 20 other villages to reclaim the fruits of their labor that had been forcibly counter-settled by tyrannical landlords during Chiang Kai-shek's occupation. Twenty-four villages, including Cangtuwo, have also organized workers', peasants', women's, and militia self-defense groups, and quickly arrested the traitor Zhao Qisan and Chiang Kai-shek's secret agent Liang Weichun, five people in total, and sent them to the government. Now, the door to land reform has been opened throughout the county.
