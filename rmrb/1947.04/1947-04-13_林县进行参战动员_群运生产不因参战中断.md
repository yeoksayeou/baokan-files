　　Lin County Carries Out Mobilization for War
    Mass Movement Production Not Interrupted Due to War Participation
    [This Newspaper] Lin County's county and district level key cadres gathered on March 22nd to carry out a major mobilization for war participation. The County Party Committee called on all cadres to take immediate action, mobilizing all manpower and material resources to support the front lines. Cadres at the county, district, and village levels, especially Communist Party members, should work hard in their positions. It also pointed out that participation in the war must be combined with production and mass movements. Specifically, it put forward: If you want to have a good time, bravely go to the battlefield; if you want to win the battle, bring your wife and children along. Village cadres and activists should participate in supporting the war effort like the masses, and lead the masses to actively participate in the war. It proposed: Cadres and the masses work together, and Communist Party members take the lead. Cadres should also care about the lives of the masses and solve their difficulties during the war. The organizational leadership for war participation includes the county and district organizing front headquarters and logistics departments, led by key cadres with division of labor. The participating militia organize militia regiments, squads, and detachments. Stretcher bearers and porters organize echelons. Cadres are assigned to lead, departing in shifts to participate in the war on the front lines, and transporting supplies in the rear. The logistics department mainly organizes manpower and material resources to ensure the supply of grain, firewood, and goods, delivering them on time and in the correct quantities, ensuring that the army and passing wounded and sick soldiers have food, drink, and lodging. Reception centers and stations are established in villages and towns along the main roads, with appropriate cadres assigned to take care of them. The county specifically stipulates methods for supporting the war effort, achieving precise calculation and avoiding wasting civilian labor. The county and district have separate specialized organizational leadership for rear production and mass movements, continuing to deepen the movement without affecting participation in the war. The slogan is: Young and strong men go to the front to fight Chiang Kai-shek, women, the elderly, and children fight to overthrow feudalism in the rear. Currently, powerful cadres are being organized in several types of villages to carry out intensive campaigns. In terms of production, it is advocated that women, children, and old men organize themselves. It is proposed: Men go to the front to participate in the war, women and children engage in production. Ensure that no land is left uncultivated and that grain production is not reduced. Actions have already begun: plowing spring land, weeding wheat fields, and delivering manure, striving to complete it by the end of March. (Shi Feng)
