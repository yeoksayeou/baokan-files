　　[This newspaper's Taiyue dispatch, 10th] Qinshui has organized a Production Review Committee to uniformly lead the review and production efforts. The land reform in Qinshui County has been largely completed, but the development of the movement is extremely uneven. Many villages still retain feudal vestiges, and cadres and activists have not completely returned all of their gains. As spring plowing is approaching, under the leadership of the Land Investigation and Production Committee, all cadres in the county's various systems will be uniformly assigned to organize Land Investigation and Production Teams, going deep into the villages to continue implementing land investigation and leading production. Xichuan and other seven villages have been identified as key points and work has begun.

　　沁水结合生产继续复查
    组织复查生产委员会
    【本报太岳十日电】沁水组织复查生产委员会，统一领导复查与生产。沁水全县土地改革已大体完成，但运动发展极不平衡，不少村庄还留有封建尾巴，干部与积极分子多得果实尚未完全退出。目前已临春耕，因此在查田生产委员会领导之下，将全县所有各系统干部统一分配，组织查田生产小组，深入村庄继续贯彻查田与领导生产。现已确定西川等七村为基点，开始进行工作。
