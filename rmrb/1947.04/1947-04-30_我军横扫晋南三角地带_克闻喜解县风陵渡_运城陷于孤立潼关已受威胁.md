　　Our Army Sweeps Through Southern Shanxi Triangle Area
    Captures Wenxi, Jie County, Fenglingdu
    Yuncheng Isolated, Tongguan Threatened

    [Xinhua News Agency, Tongpu Front, urgent telegram, 0500 hours, 27th] The People's Liberation Army in southern Shanxi captured Wenxi, Jie County, and Fenglingdu, the throat of the three provinces of Shanxi, Henan, and Shaanxi, on the 26th, and is now confronting the enemy guarding Tongguan. The two blood vessels of the Chiang army in southern Shanxi (the other being Yumemouth) have now been completely severed; the People's Liberation Army can shell Tongguan at any time, cutting off the Longhai Railway. The Tongpu Railway, with Fenglingdu as its terminus, from Shicun, Linfen, to Fenglingdu, except for the isolated strongholds of Anyi and Yuncheng, is now controlled by the People's Liberation Army for more than 400 li. It is reported that Wenxi and Jie County are the 16th and 17th county towns liberated by the People's Liberation Army in southern Shanxi.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Tongpu Front, 27th] (Delayed) In the Quwo battle, the People's Liberation Army damaged an American-style Chiang plane that was cooperating with the enemy in the city. It has now been ascertained that the plane crashed near Nan＠zhen, Jiang County, with tail number 227565, and the pilot was killed.
    [This newspaper, Taiyue, 27th] During the first attack on Ronghe by a certain unit, three soldiers who had been liberated from the Chiang army not long ago lost contact. They hid in a cave in the enemy area for two days and nights, and finally returned to the unit after the troops captured the city. During our army's first attack on Ronghe, soldiers Zhang Weiyou, Wu Yaozhong, and Yuan Zhanli were the first to rush into the city. Later, when the troops withdrew, they were trapped in the city. Although in the tiger's den of the Chiang army, they did not waver and firmly believed that their troops would return. They hid in a courtyard, with the bunker and guards of the Chiang soldiers on the city wall to the left, and the barracks of the Chiang army to the right, a very dangerous situation. But they were calm and unafraid. A Chiang soldier broke into the courtyard and almost discovered them. For safety, they dug a hole and hid in another courtyard. At night, the three touched the city wall, trying to jump over it, but there were many sentries, so they returned. In the most dangerous situation, they did not discuss how to surrender, but how to die heroically, to die together. When our troops entered Ronghe City, Zhang Weiyou and the other two quickly ran to their own troops. The brothers shook their hands warmly and with surprise, and the three smiled and said, "Our guns and grenades are still here!"

　　我军横扫晋南三角地带
    克闻喜解县风陵渡         
    运城陷于孤立潼关已受威胁
    【新华社同蒲前线二十七日晨五时急电】晋南人民解放军于二十六日攻克闻喜、解县及秦晋豫三省咽喉之风陵渡，正与潼关守敌对峙中。晋南蒋军两条输血管（另一条为禹门口），至此乃完全切断；解放军可随时炮击潼关，斩断陇海路。以风陵渡为终点之同蒲线，自临汾史村起至风陵渡止，除安邑、运城孤立据点外，已为人民解放军控制四百余里。按闻喜、解县为晋南解放军解放之第十六、十七座县城。
    【新华社同蒲前线二十七日电】（迟到）曲沃战斗中，人民解放军击伤配合城内敌人作战之美式蒋机一架，现已查明该机落于绛县南＠镇附近，机尾号码２２７５６５，驾驶员一人毙命。
    【本报太岳二十七日电】某部在第一次攻击荣河时，有三个从蒋军中解放不久的战士失掉联络，他们在敌区洞穴里隐蔽了两昼夜，终于在部队攻克该城后，回到了部队。在我军第一次攻击荣河时，战士张维友、吴耀忠、袁占礼首先冲进城内，后来部队撤出，他们被阻在城里。虽然处在蒋军虎穴中，但是毫不动摇，坚信自己的部队一定会回来。他们隐蔽在一座院子里，左方是城墙上的碉堡与守卫的蒋兵，右方是蒋军的营房，处境非常危险。但他们泰然镇静毫无惧色，院里闯进一个蒋军，几乎发现了他们，为安全计，他们挖洞穿过另一院落隐蔽。夜里，三人摸城墙，企图跳墙而出，但岗哨甚多，又返回去。在最危险情况下，他们不是讨论如何投降缴枪，而是如何壮烈的死，死在一块。当我们的部队攻入荣河城，张维友等三人飞快的跑到自己的部队去。兄弟们亲切而惊喜的紧握他们的手，三人笑着说：“我们的枪和手榴弹都还在呢？”
