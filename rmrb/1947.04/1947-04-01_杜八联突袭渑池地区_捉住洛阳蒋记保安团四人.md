　　【Reported from Taiyue on the 29th of this month】 The people's militia of Jiyuan have launched a movement to defend Chairman Mao and render meritorious service in annihilating the enemy along the Yellow River, stretching over a hundred li from Qinmeng in the east to Wangwu in the west. The waterborne militia, with Du Balian as its backbone, crossed the Yellow River southward on the 5th and raided the Mianchi area behind Chiang's army. On the 20th, they operated in Maozhuanggou, the "heart" of Chiang's army, and captured four members of the Luoyang Security Regiment. The Sixth District guerrilla group in the west proposed to annihilate fifteen enemies in one month. The directly subordinate company densely laid a "quick-firing" explosive net on the Nanling area at the junction of Ji and Meng. On the 13th, they wounded two enemies at Lingguan Temple, causing great panic among the enemy. On the 16th, Li Shiju, a member of the enemy reserve team, surrendered to the militia. On the 17th, they advanced along the Majialing and Guozhuang areas on Nanling, compressing the enemy in the Baipo and Nancheng areas of Meng County. The Wang Yinghe combat team of the guerrilla group operated in the Dianliu area and captured one enemy and wounded another in three hours on the 21st. In the east, Wang Jie and Li Xun's detachments of the Second and Third District guerrilla groups combined thunder guns in Lingtou Village to kill one enemy and wound three. The detachment led by Zhang Guangmen advanced towards Peicun and attacked the Chiang army that was looting grain in the village on the 15th, killing and wounding three enemies. This continuous stream of victories has encouraged the Meng County Independent Battalion's enthusiasm for killing the enemy. On the 16th, the unit rushed into Yeqiang, captured nine enemies, and seized nine rifles. On the 20th, they attacked Gudan, killing and capturing three enemies and seizing five guns.

　　【Reported from Taiyue on the 29th of this month】 On the 14th, the Jinan Front held a mobilization meeting for guerrilla warfare heroes and meritorious service in the flames of war. Thousands of guerrillas and militiamen from Yi, Lin, Ji, Lu, An, Xia, and Xinxing counties attended. After the meeting, Chairman Li Mingru briefly described the significance of the meeting, and then began to award prizes. The recipients included the guerrilla teams from Yi, Lin, Ji, Lu, Wen, Xia, and Xin counties. The military region awarded these four counties 10,000 yuan in local currency and militia hero Ren Kelang 1,000 yuan. During the typical reports, the heroic deeds of guerrilla warfare hero Zhao Chuan and militia hero Ren Kelang were praised by all. Afterwards, Deputy Political Commissar Wang Guanchao announced the call to launch a meritorious service movement. On the spot, each hero and each guerrilla team brewed meritorious services, all eager to try, determined to annihilate six companies of the enemy in the next month. Finally, Political Commissar Chai concluded that the Jinan military and civilians have not only adhered to their positions in the past six months, but also cooperated with the frontal battlefield to contain the majority of Chiang's army in Jinan, successfully completing the combat missions of expedition to Jiangxian, Yicheng, and Yuanqu, making our troops stronger, replenishing weapons, and protecting the initial realization of land to the tillers in some areas. These achievements are inseparable from the heroic and model figures present at the meeting. It is hoped that more heroes will emerge in the meritorious service movement.
