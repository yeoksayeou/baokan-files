Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, April 22nd: Major Rigg and Captain Collins, two U.S. military officers captured near Changchun while attempting to scout the positions of the Democratic Allied Forces, were sent off today (April 22nd) to a designated location for deportation. After being captured on March 1st, the Democratic Allied Forces Headquarters immediately dispatched personnel to investigate, and the deputy company commander, Ma Ruqi, who captured them, was brought back from the front line for a confrontation. Deputy Company Commander Ma arrived in Harbin on March 27th, and after the final investigation ended on the 29th, the Democratic Allied Forces Headquarters, after a detailed investigation, clarified the case and issued a public notice on April 4th, deciding to send them out of the country in accordance with the policy of leniency. Throughout the investigation, the investigators maintained an attitude of humbly studying and seeking the truth, allowing Rigg and Collins to say what they wanted without any restraint. Collins, et al., could not help but acknowledge the fact that they were captured while scouting our military positions under the cover of the Chiang army, due to the serious attitude of our handling of the case. The English transcripts of the questions and answers were formally typed out only after they had been revised and agreed upon, and they signed each page for the record. The People's Army also translated the communique into English, and General Li Minran, Director of the Foreign Affairs Office of the Democratic Allied Forces Headquarters, formally notified the two officers, informing them of the time and place of their deportation. They nodded frequently and expressed their gratitude for the considerate care they received during their stay in Harbin. During the conversation, Rigg asked General Li, "If the Democratic Allied Forces occupy other cities in the Northeast, such as Changchun, what will be the attitude towards American expatriates?" General Li immediately replied, "As long as they do not take hostile actions against our army, all foreigners, including American expatriates, will be properly protected."

Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, April 22nd: The news of the case of U.S. military officers Rigg and Collins has aroused great shock and anger in all circles of Harbin. Mr. Gao Chongmin, Vice Chairman of the Northeast Administrative Committee, said when meeting with reporters: "This is another exposure of Chiang Kai-shek's thorough betrayal of the country and the aggressive ambitions of U.S. imperialism. The people of the whole country should be extremely vigilant." Regarding the sophistry of the U.S. Embassy in Nanjing, which claimed that "they were performing the normal duties of military attachés" and "neutral actions" (see Associated Press Shanghai, April 15th), Vice Chairman Gao ridiculed it as "burying one's head in the sand." He said, "U.S. imperialism equips the Chiang army with airplanes and cannons, sends military advisory groups to plan military operations for the Chiang army, massacres the Chinese people, and even directly participates in the war and interferes in China's internal affairs. What "normal" and "neutral" are they talking about? Only the fascist dictionaries translated from German by Truman's cronies, Vandenberg and his ilk, can explain that." Mr. Che Xiangchen, member of the Northeast Political Committee and President of Harbin University, earnestly advised U.S. imperialism to pull back from the precipice, quickly withdraw its troops and military advisory groups stationed in China, and withdraw from the vortex of the Chinese civil war! Otherwise, the Chinese people will definitely oppose it to the end.

　　民主联军总部
    遣送被俘美军官出境
    高崇民等痛斥美使馆狡辩
    【新华社东北二十二日电】在长春附近战斗中图侦察民主联军阵地被俘之美军军官芮格少校、及柯林士上尉二人，已于今日（二十二日）首途赴指定地点被送出境。彼等于三月一日被俘后，即由民主联军总部派员进行调查，并从前线调回俘掳彼等之副连长马如起等前来对质。马连副于三月二十七日抵哈，至二十九日最后一次调查结束，民主联军总部经过详细调查，案情已白，乃于四月四日发出公告，决定仍本宽大政策将彼等遣送出境。在调查中主持者始终以虚心研究探求真理之态度，使芮格等言所欲言，毫无拘束。柯等对我处理案件的认真态度，而不得不承认是在蒋军掩护下侦察我军阵地时被俘之事实。问答之英文记录皆经彼等经过修改同意后始正式打出，由彼等逐页签字存案。民军并将该文告译成英文，由民主联军总部外事处长李敏然将军正式通知二人，同时告以遣送出境之时间地点，彼等频频点头，并表示对彼等留哈市时期照顾周到之谢意。在谈话中芮格曾问李将军：“如民主联军占领东北其他城市例如长春时，对美侨之态度如何？”李将军即答复称：“只要不对我军采取敌对行为，一切外侨包括美侨在内，均妥为保护。”
    【新华社东北二十二日电】美军官芮格及柯林士一案公布后，哈市各界极为震愤。东北行政委员会副主席高崇民先生，于接见记者时称：“这是蒋介石彻底卖国和美帝国主义侵略野心的再一次暴露，全国人民应万分警惕。”对于南京美大使馆所称：“彼等待执行武官之正常职务”及“中立行动”之狡辩（见美联社上海十五日电），高副主席嘲之为“掩耳盗铃”。他说：“美帝国主义以飞机大炮装备蒋军，派军事顾问团为蒋军计划军事，屠杀中国人民，甚至直接参战，干涉中国内政，还谈什么“正常”和“中立”，那只有杜鲁门的伙友范登堡辈从德文翻译来的法西斯辞典才可以解释。”东北政委会委员、哈尔滨大学校长车向忱老先生，则忠告美帝国主义悬崖勒马，迅速撤退驻华军队及军事顾问团等，退出中国内战漩涡！否则中国人民必将反对到底。
