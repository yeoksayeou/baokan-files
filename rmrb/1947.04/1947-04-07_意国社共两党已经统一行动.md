Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 2nd. According to "World News and Comments" magazine, the unity between the Italian Communist and Socialist parties is becoming increasingly close, and the position of the two parties in the national political life is increasing. On October 27th last year, the Italian Communist and Socialist parties signed an agreement on unified action in Rome. The agreement includes the following eight articles: (1) Eliminate all remnants of fascism and oppose all attempts to restore fascist rule; (2) Defend and consolidate the democratic republic and the various freedoms of the people; (3) Carry out industrial reform and reconstruction on the basis of nationalizing monopoly enterprises, large banks, and public utilities, and organize factory committees; (4) Reform agriculture on the basis of eliminating large land ownership and develop cooperative forms of agricultural production; (5) Pay wages and pensions commensurate with the current cost of living to improve the situation of physical and mental laborers; (6) Protect the status of workers with appropriate social legislation to guarantee everyone's job and a fixed, appropriate minimum wage; (7) Stabilize the currency to protect the real value of workers' wages, pensions, and small investments. This will be achieved through strict taxation of the rich's income tax, capital tax, tax reform, and increased national total productivity; (8) Implement a foreign policy that can regain Italy's political and economic independence, defend international collective security, and share the fate of people and workers' organizations around the world to achieve peace. The joint central organ of the Socialist and Communist parties, composed of three leaders from each party, will take joint action in the parliament. In meetings attended by the secretaries of the two parties, the ministers of the Socialist and Communist parties will take consistent action in the cabinet. Liaison committees of the two parties will be established throughout the country to formulate the platform for the next general election. The list of candidates participating in the municipal elections will be approved by the local liaison agencies of the two parties. The results of the municipal elections held in some areas of Italy on October 20 showed that the joint action of the Socialist and Communist parties has achieved effective results. In this municipal election, the Socialist and Communist parties won a total of 1,485 seats, of which 1,222 seats belonged to the joint election list of the Socialist and Communist parties, the Christian Democratic Party won 1,193 seats, the Liberal Party won 36 seats, the Republican Party won 55 seats, independents won 714 seats, and the semi-fascist "Common Man's Party" won 173 seats.
