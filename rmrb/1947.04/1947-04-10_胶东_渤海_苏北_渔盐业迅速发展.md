Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 7th: Jiaodong's Weihai City has seen rapid development in its fishing and salt industries in the past month. Over 1,800 fishing households in the city received 6.5 million yuan (each yuan equivalent to 15 yuan in Kuomintang currency) in fishing loans from the democratic government and 50,000 jin of grain loans from the aquatic products company. Their boats and nets have all been repaired and will be going to sea soon. Local merchants have raised funds to open four fishing firms: Dexingxiang, Yuanjuhai, Fuchanghe, and Renhengchang. In the salt industry, in addition to government loans of 1 million yuan, the city's Industry and Commerce Bureau has also placed orders for future salt worth 7 million yuan, with the salt price set at 4 to 7 jin of rice per dan of salt. The bureau is also paying salt farmers 40% of the total value of their future salt in advance to help them with production. Salt farmers who have received support have already begun repairing their salt fields and procuring tools. Most of the wasteland under the jurisdiction of Longjia 鲎所 has been repaired, and new salt fields are being opened. Chu Churen, a salt farmer in Ludao Kou Village, started salt production as soon as he received assistance, and has already harvested over 1,000 jin of new salt in recent days.

Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 7th: Salt from the Bohai region is selling well in the North China and East China Liberated Areas. The road from Zhanhua to Linyi is busy day and night, with over 1,200 carts traveling back and forth each day. According to statistics from the Industry and Commerce Sub-bureau of the democratic government, transportation costs in January and February reached over 57 million North China currency (each yuan equivalent to 15 yuan in Kuomintang currency). The Industry and Commerce Sub-bureau has also established grain cooperatives in villages at each salt station, allowing salt transporters to also transport grain, saving on procurement procedures and time.

Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 6th: "Spring sweeping" has begun in the vast salt fields of the Yellow Sea coast. The Yancheng and Funing District Salt Affairs Bureau of Northern Jiangsu has recently loaned 300,000 jin of grain to 80 private salt reclamation companies in the new salt fields to provide food for salt farmers during the "spring sweeping" period. The new salt fields are located in the famous Huaibei salt fields between the Huaikou Taizi River and the Yuhuang River Estuary, stretching over 200 li from the Song Gong Dike to the sea, covering 37,000 mu of salt fields. They produce 600,000 dan of salt annually and were newly developed after the great sea tide in 1939. In recent years, due to irregular rainfall, the embankment and dikes of each private company's salt fields have not been repaired, resulting in reduced salt production. It is now stipulated that 45% of the profits must be used to repair the embankment and dikes to increase the output of the new salt fields. Recently, Chiang Kai-shek's "coastal defense teams" attempted to land and plunder, destroying salt field production, but under the armed protection of the People's Liberation Army and the strong salt farmer self-defense forces, the salt fields remain stable.

　　胶东  渤海  苏北
  　渔盐业迅速发展
    【新华社山东七日电】胶东威海卫市，月来渔盐业迅速发展，全市一千八百余户渔民获得民主政府六百五十万元（每元折蒋币十五元）的渔业贷款及水产公司贷粮五万斤后，船网已全部修妥，日内纷纷下海。当地商人已集资开设德兴祥、源聚海、福昌和、仁恒昌等渔行四家。盐业方面，除政府贷款百万元外，市工商局亦以七百万元工款定购期盐，盐价每担包米四斤至七斤，并先交盐民期盐总值百分之四十，帮助盐民生产。现得到扶持之盐民，均已着手修滩和置备工具。龙家鲎所辖荒滩已大部修竣，并开设新滩。鹿道口村盐民储初仁得到帮助后，即下滩晒盐，数日来已收新盐千余斤。
    【新华社山东七日电】渤海区食盐畅销华北、华东各解放区。沾化至临邑大道上车马昼夜不绝，来往大车每日达一千二百余辆。据民主政府工商分局统计，一、二两月支出运费达北币五千七百余万元（每元折合蒋币十五元）。工商分局并在各盐站驻村组织粮食合作社，运盐者同时运粮，采购手续及时间均能节省。
    【新华社华中六日电】黄海岸广大盐场“春扫”开始，苏北盐阜区盐务管理局顷以卅万斤粮食贷与新滩八十家私营盐垦公司，供给盐民“春扫”期间食用。新滩位于淮河套子口与淤黄河口之间著名淮北盐场，自宋公堤至海边纵横二百余里盐田达三万七千亩，年产食盐六十万担，为民国二十八年大海潮以后新开辟者，近年因雨水失调，各私营公司盐场滩圩亦未修理，致盐产减收。今后规定必须以盈余百分之四十五作修理滩圩之用，以提高新滩产量。近日蒋记“海防队”企图上岸抢掠，破坏盐场生产，但在子弟兵及强大盐民自卫队武装保卫下，盐场仍安定如常。
