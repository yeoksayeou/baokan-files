　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 16th: Chenggong Lake Dispatch: The Security Council has resumed discussions on the Balkan issue. On the 14th, Soviet representative Gromyko once again fiercely criticized Truman's plan to interfere in the internal affairs of Greece and Turkey and the Vandenberg Amendment, and insisted that the United Nations should have the power to monitor US aid to Greece. Note: US representative Austin made a sophistical defense at the meeting on the 10th, denying that the US was interfering in the internal affairs of Greece, and brazenly requested the Security Council to "shelve" the Soviet proposal.

    【新华社陕北十六日电】成功湖讯：安理会已恢复巴尔干问题之讨论，苏代表格罗米柯于十四日再度猛烈抨击杜鲁门干涉希土内政之计划及范登堡修正案，并坚持联合国应有权力监视美国对希腊之援助。按：美代表奥斯丁曾于十日在会议中强词狡辩，否认美国干涉希腊内政，并腼然要求安理会“搁置”苏联之建议。
