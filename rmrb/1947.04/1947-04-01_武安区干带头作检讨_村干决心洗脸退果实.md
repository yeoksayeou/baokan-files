　　Wu'an District Cadres Take the Lead in Self-Criticism
　　Village Cadres Resolve to Cleanse Themselves and Return Illicit Gains
　　Cadres Are Originally Our Own People
　　Merit Should Be Rewarded
　　[Our Dispatch] The Eighth District of Wu'an convened a conference of cadres, activists, and honest peasants on the 19th of last month. The central theme was to resolve the discord between cadres and the masses, further enhance the consciousness of honest peasants, and thoroughly eliminate feudalism. The conference lasted six days, with over 800 people attending, half of whom were honest peasants. The process of the conference was as follows: first, honest peasants were mobilized to raise opinions about the cadres. Initially, they had many concerns and feared retaliation. After receiving support and commending those who actively raised opinions, everyone began to speak their minds. In two days, more than 200 people raised opinions. Immediately afterward, the leadership mobilized the cadres to examine themselves. At first, the cadres were very pessimistic, feeling that they had led the struggle for more than a year, but now they had become "objects of struggle." The Secretary of the Sub-district Committee and the District Head took the lead in self-criticism, affirming that the leadership should be responsible for the shortcomings of village cadres, and mobilizing everyone to raise opinions about the district cadres to "cleanse their faces" first. The district cadres' sincere self-criticism moved the village cadres, and everyone realized that "cleansing the face" would not diminish prestige but would enhance it, which increased the village cadres' determination to cleanse themselves.
　　After the village cadres' ideological awareness matured, they first found one or two typical examples to reflect on themselves to the masses. Sun Liuzi, the village chief of Nanzhuang Village, used his own experience to explain the benefits of "cleansing the face." He said, "Last December, the district cadres mobilized the honest peasants in our village to cleanse the cadres' faces for a whole day and night. At that time, I thought I would be severely struggled against. As a result, the masses only asked me to return the excessive gains. Some sabotage elements incited the honest peasants to smash me to death. Everyone said, 'We can't betray our conscience. This village chief is resolute in fighting the landlords!' and let me continue to be a cadre. This January, after the honest peasants all stood up, leading as a cadre was not difficult at all. The honest peasants knew which landlord had 'hidden goods', and as a result, more things were struggled out than last time. Now I understand: If honest peasants are not mobilized, the landlords cannot be thoroughly struggled against. As long as cadres work for the masses, the masses will definitely work for the cadres." His words had a great enlightening effect. The village chief of Beixizhuang Village said, "I made three mistakes: (1) Wang Jingke, a person from another village, had farmed land for the landlord for several years in our village. Last year, he proposed to settle accounts with the landlord, but I was afraid that he would take away the things, so I scared him away. (2) Li Congqing, a hired laborer, was in the peasant association. His wife had concealed a bundle of clothes for the landlord, and I swept him and the landlord out the door together. (3) We cadres were the ones who were 'screwing around' when distributing the fruits, letting each other have more, and the honest peasants only got a few hundred." After the village cadres reflected on themselves to the masses, everyone's hearts calmed down. Those who initially advocated struggling against the cadres or replacing the cadres now had their thinking straightened out. The leadership then asked, "In the past, did we have any opinions about the puppet Baolzhang?" Everyone said, "Yes!" "Why didn't you raise them?" Everyone said, "No one dared!" "Why can we dare to raise opinions about cadres now?" Everyone said with a smile, "Because they are our own people!" The leadership then used an analogy, saying, "Cadres are like shop assistants, working for the boss. It's good every day, but it's unfair to forget the daily goodness because of one bad day." So the masses consciously proposed to evaluate the cadres' merits. Each village launched discussions, evaluating the cadres' good points or overall goodness, and reported the merits to the district. For example, although the village chief of Chongyi Village had a bad attitude towards everyone, he was particularly resolute in fighting the landlords, so he was also given credit. This made the cadres very happy, and they all said, "If we don't do a good job, how can we be worthy of everyone." The leadership finally proposed: Go down and add merit on merit. If the honest peasants in any village can be fully mobilized, leaving no feudal household or "stubborn" household, the district will give that village a great merit.
　　After the "knots" were all untied, everyone laughed heartily when they met. Some village cadres said: It's good to work for the people. If you do a good job, everyone will give you credit; if you have shortcomings, everyone will "cleanse your face." Cadres, activists, and honest peasants all swore: We must be "of one heart" going forward, and ensure that not a single feudal tail is left, and not a single "stubborn" household is missed.

　　武安区干带头作检讨
    村干决心洗脸退果实
    干部原是自己人
    有了功劳要报功
    【本报讯】武安八区于上月十九日召开干部、积极分子、老实农民会议，中心内容为解开干群疙瘩，进一步提高老实农民觉悟，以求彻底消灭封建。大会历时六天，到会人数共八百余，其中半数为老实农民。会议进程为首先发动老实农民给干部提意见，起初他们顾虑多，怕报复，经过撑腰，并表扬积极提意见的人后，大家才都说开了，两天中间就有二百多人提意见。紧接着领导上便发动干部检查自己，起初干部很悲观，觉得自己领导斗争一年多，现在却又变成“斗争对象”了。分委书记、区长首先作自我检讨，肯定村干有缺点领导要负责任，并发动大家给区干提意见首先洗脸。区干的诚恳检讨，感动了村干部，大家认识到“洗脸”不是降低威信，而能提高威信，便增加了村干的洗脸决心。
    村干思想觉悟成熟后，先找出一两个典型，来向群众反省。南庄村长孙六子更以他自己的经验，说明了“洗脸”的好处。他说：“去年腊月区干发动俺村老实农民，一直给干部洗了一天一夜脸，我那时以为可要狠狠斗争我，结果群众只让我退出多得的果实，有些破坏分子活动老实农民要砸死我。大家说：“咱们不能昧良心，人家村长斗争地主可坚决呢！”又让我当了干部。今年正月，老实农民都起来后，干部领导一点也不费劲。那家地主有“内货”，老实农民都知道，结果斗出来的东西，比那一次都多。我现在想通了：老实农民不发动，地主就斗不彻底。干部只要为群众，群众也一定为干部。”他的话启发作用很大。北西庄村长说：“我犯了三点错误：（一）我村外乡人王景科，给地主种了几年地。去年他提出要给老财算账，我怕他分走了东西，就把他吓跑了。（二）长工李从庆他在农会，他女人给地主包庇了一包袱衣服，我连地主带他一块扫地出门。（三）分果实都是我们干部在一块日鬼，你让我，我让你，老实农民才分到几百。”村干部向群众反省后，大家的心也就平静下来，开始主张斗干部的或撤换干部的，现在思想也打通了。领导上又提出“过去伪保长咱们对他有意见没有”？大家说：“有！”“为啥不提？”大家说：“没人敢！”“现在为什么对干部有意见敢提了？”大家笑着说：“因为是自己人！”领导上又比喻说：“干部就像伙计，给主家做事，天天都好，一天不好就忘了天天好是不公道的。”于是群众便自觉的提出：为干部评功，各村又展开了讨论，评出干部在那一点好或全部好，都向区上报了功。如崇义村长虽然对大家态度不好，可是斗争地主特别坚决，也给记了功。这一下干部可高兴了，都说：“要不好好干，怎对得起大家。”领导上最后提出：下去要功上加功，那个村老实农民能都发动起来，不剩一户封建及一户“圪道”，区上就给那个村记个大功。
    “疙瘩”都解开后，一见面就哈哈大笑，有的村干部说：替人民办事就是好，干好了大家给记功，有缺点大家给“洗脸”。干部、积极分子、老实农民都宣了誓：下去一定要“一条心”，做到不留一户封建尾巴，不丢一个“圪道”户。（天林）
