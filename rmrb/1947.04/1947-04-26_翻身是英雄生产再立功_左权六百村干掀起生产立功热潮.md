    [This newspaper's Zuoquan report] The Zuoquan production mobilization meeting, starting with letting the cadres fully vent their grievances, affirmed the cadres' achievements, encouraged them to continue their efforts to contribute to the people, and further established the idea of cadres leading the masses to prosper, laying a preliminary foundation for leading this year's large-scale production movement. Although the county's campaign to unite cadres and the masses had gained many good experiences, the development of the movement was very uneven. Out of the county's 168 administrative villages, only 25 villages had done well. 56 villages had rectified relations but not fully achieved unity between cadres and the masses, 61 had not rectified relations, and 5 had been rectified badly. Many village cadres only saw the masses airing their grievances and had not yet seen the masses praising their achievements. In addition, cadres had the mistaken historical experience of being "rectified." Therefore, they complained about their superiors and were in low spirits, with no intention of discussing production. The leadership immediately analyzed this situation and believed that explaining the misunderstandings generated by cadres in rectifying relations was the key to transitioning to the production movement. They adopted the method of letting cadres fully vent their grievances. So everyone started talking. Some said: "The masses keep raising opinions, but the higher authorities don't make any decisions." Some said: "If we have blemishes on our faces, let those with fair faces try it." Others said: "It's always been like this: mobilizing the masses to struggle against landlords, and then it's the cadres' turn! In 1941, resisting the stubborn elements meant 'protecting human rights.' In 1943 there was the mass movement, and in 1944 there was another democratic movement. Anyway, we are like a piece of meat between two stones (village cadres)." After the grievances were vented, in response to the negative emotions, the question was raised: "After we led the peasants to uproot poverty and turn over, should we also lead the masses to produce wealth and plant roots of prosperity?" "Should we continue our eight years of achievements, or abandon them? (Quit working)." After discussion, some began to realize: "Saying we should step down is wrong. Asking those with fair faces to take over is because they look good! Taking work as important is not being responsible to the masses." The leadership seized on this positive factor for praise and promptly asked: "Then how will you go back to unite the masses?" This launched a discussion, first with cadres who had rectified their relations speaking. They highlighted their achievements while talking about how they had reflected on their shortcomings and how the masses supported them. For example, the chairman of the Nan Zhi Farmers' Association said: "Rectifying relations is not bad. The masses gave me ten opinions, and nine of them were correct. Only Jiang Lao Si had prejudices against me and raised one false issue, which was refuted by the masses." The village chief of Guantan said: "At the beginning of rectifying relations, I also complained that the superiors did not make decisions and prepared to pack up and return to Wu'an (my hometown). Later, the district cadres kept talking, and I realized that I had problems. Looking back, it was still our problem. We distributed more than ten stones of grain from the fruit harvest. I thought that as a cadre working for a winter and neglecting so much work, I should get it. So I came up with the idea to privately distribute it among the political director and eight cadres. Later, the masses reacted strongly, so I had to confess to the masses one by one, admit my mistakes, and return the things. I was just afraid that the masses would treat me as a target of struggle. As a result, when I told the truth, the masses all laughed. I can rest assured now. Not only can I rest assured, but especially honest people who used to not even attend meetings regularly now often ask about meetings and start working on village affairs. Rectifying relations is still for me. Cadres will eventually have a good outcome." District cadres also made self-criticisms, explaining that the village cadres' mistakes should be shared by the leadership. This cleared everyone's thinking and inspired the cadres present to comprehensively examine their own ideological consciousness. Each cadre boldly exposed their shortcomings while highlighting their achievements, gradually eliminating dissatisfaction with their superiors. On this basis, the leadership also conducted a review of the cadre policies in history in 1941 and 1944, emphatically pointing out: We have a tree planting policy today, not a tree pulling policy. Rectifying relations is like planting trees. The superiors plant (leaders cultivate cadres), and the masses water (help to wash faces and correct shortcomings), cultivating cadres to become talents. From then on, the cadres' emotions were greatly excited, and the cadres' resistance to rectifying relations was transformed. The old cadres who participated in the eight years of the war of resistance affirmed that their achievements could not be erased. But the eight years referred to were being wholeheartedly for the masses, actively responsible, selfless, democratic, and not administrative orders, corruption, selfishness, and self-interest. To cherish achievements, one must correct shortcomings to add achievements to achievements. Failure to correct them would mean adding mistakes to achievements. This encouragement inspired the cadres present to cherish their own historical ideas and established the requirement of adding achievements to achievements. Everyone said: "This time we have to go back and actively rectify. If we don't rectify well, we can't unite the masses." On this basis, everyone turned to discussing the issue of large-scale production. First, everyone raised a fear of getting rich. Lian Bi, the political director, said: "In the past, I was a careful person. I even wanted to spend one ticket as two. Last summer, I dared to get rich. Last winter, the village's landlords were all struggled against. I was very happy, but when I saw that some benefited households who got fruit without working, I was just afraid that they would eat everything. The landlords are gone, and they will definitely ask us to borrow. If we don't lend to them, we are afraid that people will say that we cadres are not good role models. At this time, I thought, it's better to drink liquor." Other cadres also raised similar opinions. The leadership then raised several questions from a positive perspective and asked everyone to discuss them: "Are we struggling against feudalism or against getting rich?" "Is hiring long-term workers now feudal exploitation?" "Does the new society mean everyone produces or rewards idlers?" Labor hero Jia Fu Kui said: "The Communist Party leads us to struggle against landlords to make all of us poor people rich, like riding a donkey on a rocky slope." XX said: "Poor people in the old society always worked and were exploited by landlords and could not get rich; now that they have turned over and no longer work, it is the same as landlord thinking, and it is of course shameful." From the discussion, everyone clarified that leading everyone to get rich is the only correct path. The leadership also made it clear: "Everyone gets rich, no one exploits anyone, and can there be any more struggles? Only by leading everyone to get rich can we be worthy of being heroes in the second revolution. In the future, if there are any difficulties, we can only promote and help from production, and we must never use the masses' things to fill them in." After such bottom-up agitation, the leadership's guidance directly and forcefully cleared the cadres' thinking. According to statistics, out of the 622 village cadres present, 433 were originally afraid of getting rich. After the discussion, only 75 were afraid of getting rich. Not only were they all willing to get rich, but 450 of them could specifically achieve the goal of "cultivating three and saving one." Then everyone discussed specific ways to get rich and how to organize the masses to participate in mutual aid.

    On the eighth day of the meeting, based on the cadres' ideological consciousness, an unprecedentedly enthusiastic and intense campaign to make contributions was launched, creating a widespread revolutionary competition between villages, between cadres, and between heroes and skilled workers. A solemn ceremony for making contributions was held. Comrade Zhai Ying, secretary of the county party committee, on behalf of the county party committee, called on all party members and cadres to not only make contributions to the people in the past, but especially to make greater contributions in the future production and construction movement, and to strive to become model party members. He proposed four calls: (1) To clear the masses' thinking, organize them on a large scale, and universally achieve the goal of "cultivating three and saving one." (2) To raise the masses' awareness, support the front line, and give play to the initiative and creativity of party members in the combination of production and participation in the war. (3) To effectively help military families and martyrs' families establish their families, help solve various difficulties, and universally achieve the living standards of middle peasants. (4) To promote a democratic style of work, constantly correct shortcomings, unite the masses, and all party members should become leaders on the production front. Before he finished speaking, everyone proposed competition conditions. Nan Zhi Bian Village proposed the competition conditions with Tong Tan: to ensure that 100% of the masses are truly voluntarily organized to achieve "cultivating two and saving one," with no idlers in the village, and to cultivate two heroes by autumn. Tong Tan labor hero Jia Fu Kui confidently said: "In addition to answering the above conditions, we must achieve self-sufficiency in textile clothing, two households with one pig, one person with one chicken, and ensure that military families, martyrs' families, and participants in the war do not feel difficulty in production, and organize mutual assistance to play a role. The labor heroes of each village also proposed conditions to each other. Such an enthusiastic and intense wave of contributions and revolutionary competition is indeed a concentrated expression of the results of the eight-day meeting. In the competition conditions and the standards for making contributions, attention was paid to the combination of agriculture and sideline occupations, the combination of production and participation in the war, and helping military families and martyrs' families to get rich. What is even more different from the past is that the conditions of each cadre and hero are inseparable from a democratic style of work and ideological leadership, and everyone must guarantee and discuss with the masses without monopolizing. Finally, they all unanimously expressed their welcome to the county's inspection, and to compete for the best at the Heroes' Conference in the fall. (Joint Office)

　　翻身是英雄生产再立功
    左权六百村干掀起生产立功热潮
    引导干部发尽牢骚
    摆功劳中检查缺点
    培养干部栽树成材
    今后干部方向
    领导大家发财
    决心学习民主作风
    劳英大会再见高低
    【本报左权讯】左权生产动员大会，从放手让干部发尽牢骚入手，肯定干部功劳，鼓励干部再接再厉为人民立功，并进而树立干部领导群众发财的思想，打下领导今年大生产运动的初步基础。全县开展干群团结运动中，虽曾获得不少好的经验，但运动发展的情况很不平衡，全县一百六十八个行政村只有二十五个村做得较好，整过关系但未完全达到干群团结的有五十六个，未整过的六十一个，整坏了的有五个；不少村庄干部只看到群众发牢骚，还没看见群众表功劳；加之干部有“被整”的错误历史经验。因此对上埋怨，情绪低落，更没讨论生产的心思。领导上当即分析此种情况，认为把干部整关系中所产生的误解说通，是转入生产运动的关键，便采取了让干部发尽牢骚的方法；于是大家就说开了，有的说：“群众一直提意见，上级不给做一点主。”有的说：“咱脸上有斑就让脸白的来试试。”还有的说：“向来就是这样：发动群众斗了地主，就轮到干部啦！四一年反过顽固就‘保障人权’，四三年群运、四四年便又来了个民主运动，反正两块石板夹一块肉（村干部）。”……牢骚发完后，就针对消极情绪，提出：“我们领导农民拔了穷根翻了身是否还要领导群众生产发家栽富根？”“是要继续八年功劳？还是丢掉八年功劳？（不干）”经过讨论，有的开始了解到：“随便说下台不对，叫脸白的上台是看他好看哩！拿工作当要的，不是对群众负责态度。”领导上抓紧表扬这一积极因素，及时提出：“那么回去如何团结群众？”这便展开了讨论，先由整好关系的干部发言：他们一面摆功劳一面说自己的缺点是如何反省的，群众怎样拥护他们，如南治农会主席说：“整关系差不了，群众给我提了十条意见，就有九条对，只有蒋老四和我有成见，提了一条假事情，还叫群众驳回去。”关滩村长说：“我在整关系一开始，也埋怨上级不做主，准备收拾回武安（老家），后来区上干部一直谈，我才想过来，检讨起来，还是咱有毛病。分果实长下十多石粮食，我以为当干部一冬天，误工那样多，应该得，我便出主意和政治主任八个干部私自分了。后来群众反映红了，只好向群众一件一件的坦白了，认了错退了东西，光怕群众把我当了斗争对象，结果我说了实话，群众都笑了。这我可算放心了，不但放了心，特别是过去连一次会也不好参加的老实人也经常问讯开会，结计开村里工作了。整关系还是为我哩，干部到底有下场。”区干部也作了检讨，说明了村干部的错误应当与领导上分担。这打通了大家的思想，启发了到会干部全面检查自己的思想自觉，每个干部都从摆功劳中大胆暴露自己的缺点，逐渐的消除了对上级不满。在这个基础上领导上也进行了四一年四四年历史上干部政策检讨，响亮的指出：我们今天是栽树政策，绝不是拔树政策，整关系和栽树一样，上边栽（领导培养干部），群众浇（帮助洗脸改缺点），培养干部成材。从此大大兴奋了干部情绪，转换了干部对整关系的抵触思想。对抗战八年的老干部肯定指出功劳是不可抹煞的。但所指的八年是赤心为群众、积极负责任、大公无私、讲民主，而不是行政命令贪污腐化自私自利。爱护功劳，就要改正缺点，才能功上加功，不改正就是功上加过。这一鼓励，启发了到会干部宝贵自己历史的思想自觉，树立了功上加功的要求，大家说：“这回回去可得主动整呀，不整好，就不能团结群众。”在这样的基础上，大家便转入了大生产问题的讨论，首先大家提出了一个怕富思想，连璧政治主任说：“往年我可是个仔细人，一张票还想当成两张花哩，去年夏天还敢发财，去年冬天村里地主斗光了，我很高兴，可是看见有些得利的圪洞户得上果实不劳动，光怕人家吃光了，地主也光了，一定问咱借，不借给吧，又怕人家说咱当干部不起模范，这时我就想，不如喝了烧酒。”其他干部也均纷纷提出类似的意见，领导上便从积极方面提出了几个问题让大家展开讨论：“咱们是斗封建哩？还是斗富哩？”“现在雇长工到底是不是封建剥削？”“新社会是人人生产还是奖励懒汉？”劳动英雄贾富魁说：“共产党领导咱们斗地主，是叫咱穷人都发财，和骑驴趁圪台一样。××说：“穷人在旧社会一直劳动受地主剥削不能富；现在翻了身再不劳动，就和地主思想一样，当然是羞耻。”从讨论中大家明确了只有领导大家都发财，才是惟一的正确道路。领导上并明确指出：人人发了财，谁也不剥削谁，还能再闹斗争？只有领导大家发财，才能当得起第二个革命中的功臣，今后有了圪洞也只有从生产中提拔帮助，绝不能拿群众的东西给以填补。经过这样自下而上圪噪打通，领导上的拨灯，直接而有力的打通干部思想，据统计：到会六百廿二个村干部中，原来怕发财的就有四百卅三人，讨论后怕发财的只剩七十五人了，不但都敢发财了，而且具体计算中有四百五十人能做到耕三余一。接着大家又讨论了如何致富的具体办法及如何组织群众参加互助等问题。
    会议第八天，在干部思想自觉的基础上，开展了空前热烈而紧张的立功运动，造成普遍的村与村、干部与干部、英雄与能手的革命竞赛，举行了隆重的立功仪式。县委书记翟英同志代表县委会号召全体党员干部不但在过去为民立功，尤其要在今后生产建设运动中立更大的功，争取模范党员，提出了四点号召：（一）打通群众思想，大量组织起来，普遍达到耕三余一。（二）提高群众觉悟，支援前线，并在生产与参战结合上发挥党员的积极性创造性。（三）切实帮助军属烈属建立家务，帮助解决各种困难，普遍达到中农生活。（四）发扬民主作风，不断改正缺点，团结群众，全体党员都要成为生产战线上的带头人。话未落音，大家便提出竞赛条件：南治编村提出与桐滩竞赛的条件是：保证百分之百的把群众真正自愿的组织起来，做到耕二余一，全村没闲人，到秋后培养出两个英雄。桐滩劳英贾富魁有信心的说：“除回答上述条件外要做到纺织穿衣自给，两户一口猪，一人一只鸡，保证军属烈属和参战人员生产不感困难，组织互助起作用。各村劳英亦均纷纷相互提出条件，这样热烈紧张的立功潮和革命竞赛，确是八天会议结果的集中表现，在竞赛条件中、立功标准里，都注意了农副业结合，生产与参战结合，帮助军属烈属发家致富，更加和已往不同的是每个干部英雄的条件都离不开民主作风和思想领导，那个也都是要保证和群众讨论不包办。最后并一致表示欢迎县里检查，秋后群英会上比高低。（联合办公室）
