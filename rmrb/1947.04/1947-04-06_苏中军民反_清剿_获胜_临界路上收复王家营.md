Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 3rd. The Gao (You) Bao (Ying) area east of the Grand Canal has achieved eight victories in eight battles against the "purge" in the past half month (March 7th to 22nd). Since February 26th, parts of the 268th and 270th Regiments of the 90th Brigade of the Nationalist Army's reorganized 4th Division, in coordination with local bandits, began a "sweep" of the Gao Bao area, successively occupying important towns such as Taojialin (more than 20 li southeast of Wangguangang), Shibao (7 li southwest of Shagou), and Shagou by March 11th, constructing temporary strongholds and implementing their "stationed purge." The military and civilians of the two counties immediately launched a two-pronged counterattack, winning eight victories in eight battles, recovering Wangjiaying and other important strongholds along the Lin (Ze) Jie (Shou) road, killing and capturing more than 160 Nationalist soldiers, seizing five Canadian machine guns, more than 90 rifles, and a part of other military supplies, while we suffered no casualties, laying a victorious foundation for the anti-"purge."

Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 3rd. Belated news: A certain district in Suqian fully launched a mass guerrilla war, smashing the nine-pronged "purge" of more than 400 Nationalist and puppet troops. On February 28th, when the Nationalist and puppet troops entered the district, they were attacked everywhere by more than 40 guerrilla groups in five townships throughout the district. The guerrilla groups in the district are composed of village cadres, each uniting three to ten emancipated peasants, with extremely high enthusiasm for killing the enemy. They either fired head-on, dispersing and transferring at any time, or detoured to the enemy's flanks to disperse soldiers; or they avoided the enemy's front, entangled and harassed, and attacked small groups of enemies. The Nationalist and puppet troops were beaten on all sides and quickly fled in panic. During the battle, the peasants even devised ways to capture enemy stragglers. A peasant in a certain township, seeing a straggling Nationalist soldier, feigned diligence and said: "The Kuomintang soldiers must be tired, I am here to lead you, the officer told me to come and greet you." After saying this, he carried him on his back, and after arriving at the village, the masses took the opportunity to tie up the Nationalist soldier. An old lady in her fifties in a certain township also held a grass hook and led three unarmed peasants to capture a straggling Nationalist soldier.

Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 3rd. The Nationalist Army's 57th and 28th Divisions, which suffered devastating blows from the People's Liberation Army last winter in northern Jiangsu, were ordered to be transferred north to Shandong in a hurry after the Luzhong Campaign, and many soldiers deserted. Two-thirds of the soldiers of the 1st Provisional Brigade (now renamed the 60th Brigade) of the Nationalist Army's 57th Division, which was originally entrenched in Xin (Pu) Hai (Zhou), were forcibly conscripted from counties such as Donghai. On the way north to Qingkou, only 90 li, the number of soldiers in each squad dropped from twelve to only five or six, or seven or eight. One company of the 1st Battalion of the 350th Regiment of the brigade originally had 165 people, but only 72 remained after desertions. The artillery battalion was reduced from 210 people to less than 100. The conscripts of the 28th Division also deserted in large numbers after suffering a serious blow under the city of Lianshui in October last year. The 573rd Regiment of the 192nd Brigade of the division lost 85 new recruits after stationing in Shuyang for one night. After staying in Xinhai for two days, more than 80 more ran away. By this time, more than half of the 2,000 new recruits who had been escorted from Hunan and Anhui over a long distance in December last year had deserted.

　　苏中军民反“清剿”获胜
  　临界路上收复王家营
    【新华社华中三日电】运河东侧高（邮）宝（应）地区，半月来（三月七日至二十二日）反“清剿”八战八捷。自二月二十六日起，蒋军整四师九十旅二六八、二七○团各一部，配合土顽，开始对高宝地区“扫荡”，至三月十一日先后侵占陶家林（望盥港东南二十余里）、时堡（沙沟西南七里）、沙沟等要镇，构筑临时据点，实行其“驻扎清剿”。该二县军民即两面展开反击，先后八战八捷，收复临（泽）界（首）公路上王家营及其他重要据点共三处，毙俘蒋军一百六十余名，缴加拿大机枪五挺，步枪九十余支，其他军用品一部，而我无一伤亡，为反“清剿”打下胜利基础。
    【新华社华中三日电】迟到消息：宿迁某区全面展开群众性游击战，粉碎蒋伪四百余人的九路“清剿”。二月二十八日，蒋伪进入区境后，当遭全区五个乡四十余游击小组到处袭击。该区游击小组系各村干部每人团结三至十多个翻身农民所组成，杀敌热情极高。或则迎头打响，随时分散转移，绕到敌人侧背打散兵；或则避开敌人正面，纠缠袭扰，打击小股敌人。蒋伪四面挨打，旋即仓惶溃退。战斗中，农民曾计捉敌散兵。某乡一农民，见一掉队蒋军即假殷勤的说：“国军走累了吧，我是给你们带路的，官长叫我来迎你。”说后把他驮在背上，到村后，群众乘机将蒋军缚住。某乡一五十多岁的老太太，亦手执草钩，带领三个徒手农民，捉住一个掉队蒋军。
    【新华社华中三日电】去冬在苏北遭人民解放军歼灭性打击的蒋军第五十七、二十八两师，于鲁中战役后，奉命匆忙北调山东途中，士兵逃亡极多。原盘据新（浦）海（州）之蒋军五十七师预一旅（现改称六十旅）士兵三分之二为东海等县强抓补充者，北上至清口，仅九十里，由每班十二人逃得只剩下五、六人，或七、八人，该旅三五○团一营一连原有一六五人，逃得仅剩七十二人，炮兵营由二一○人降为不足百人。二十八师于去年十月在涟水城下遭严重打击后，补充之壮丁逃亡亦多。该师一九二旅五七三团驻沭阳一宿，即逃亡新兵八十五名。经新海住两天，又逃跑八十余人。至此，该部在去年十二月从湘皖长途押解补充之二千名新兵，已逃亡半数以上。
