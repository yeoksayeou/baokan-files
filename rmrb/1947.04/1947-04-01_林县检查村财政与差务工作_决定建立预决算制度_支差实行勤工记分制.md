　　Lin County Inspects Village Finance and Corvée Labor

    Decides to Establish Budget and Final Account System

    Implements Work Point System for Corvée Labor

    [This newspaper, Taihang, 30th] The Lin County government held a general training session at the beginning of the month for about 1,000 village chiefs and war support directors in the county to reorganize village finance and corvée labor. The training focused on inspecting the chaotic and wasteful village finances and the imbalanced corvée labor. It made all the cadres reflect on their thinking, and discussed and stipulated new financial systems and corvée labor methods. At the beginning of the training, the leadership put forward the slogan "Everyone recognizes, everyone solves," to dispel the trainees' concerns about "being ashamed and being punished," and inspired them to boldly expose past waste facts. They discovered many serious waste phenomena and unfair corvée labor situations. Through reflection and mutual criticism, everyone realized that if the above phenomena were not overcome, the material and financial resources for the self-defense war would inevitably be weakened; if the cadres did not perform corvée labor, they would be divorced from the masses. Therefore, it was decided to return to the villages to reflect and examine themselves to the masses, and the following methods were established to be resolutely implemented: (1) Establish a universally elected village financial management committee, in which the village chief, political director, and financial director must participate. (2) Establish a budget and final account system and announce it to the masses. Expenditures should be approved by the masses. (3) The village funds should be self-sufficient through production. Reorganize village public property and temple property, or apportion a one-time fee as a fund, and invest it in cooperatives to engage in handicraft workshops for production. (4) Temporary expenditures must be approved by the county district. For village entertainment, mobilize the masses to form their own troupes and oppose spending money on performing old dramas. As for corvée labor, a work point system is implemented: 1. Determine the corvée labor burden points for each household according to the amount of labor and livestock, and settle it once a month. The total number of days of corvée labor are averaged according to the points to obtain the number of days each household should bear. 2. All men aged 18 to 50, whether they are cadres or not, must perform corvée labor. The burden point for each person is one point, businessmen and coal miners are five tenths of a point, staff above the district level, active servicemen, teachers, honorary servicemen, students, doctors and veterinarians, and sheep herders are exempt from service. The father or son of active servicemen, the weak and disabled may be reduced or exempted as appropriate. Livestock, mules and horses with a pair of teeth or more, bear two points, donkeys bear half a point, and cattle bear one point, but can be increased or decreased depending on the region. 3. Corvée labor is counted as one work unit for carrying 60 catties of weight for a round trip of 60 li. A mule carrying 120 catties counts as two work units, a donkey carrying 90 catties counts as one and a half work units, a livestock driver counts as half a work unit, and one who carries 30 catties also counts as one work unit. Those whose corvée labor exceeds their burden points can get wages, and those who do not meet it must pay wages. The wage for each work unit is ten catties of rice. War support is combined with production as exchange labor, and one work unit of corvée labor is also equivalent to one work unit of production. In order to encourage livestock breeding, livestock are exempt from corvée labor for four months before and after giving birth. In the fifth month, they perform nearby corvée labor, and donkeys and cattle used for farming are exempt from corvée labor.

　　林县检查村财政与差务工作
    决定建立预决算制度
    支差实行勤工记分制
    【本报太行三十日电】林县县政府于月初普训了全县村长与战勤主任约千余人，以整理村财政与差务工作。训练中着重对村财政混乱与浪费、支差不平衡等现象的检查，使全体干部作思想反省，并讨论规定了新的财政制度与支差办法。训练初领导上提出“大家认识、大家解决”的口号，解除受训人员“怕丢人、怕处分”的顾虑，启发大胆暴露过去浪费事实，发现了不少严重浪费现象，和差务的不公等情形。经反省与互相批评，全体认识了以上现象如不加以克服，则必然减弱自卫战争的物力财力；干部不支差，则将脱离群众。乃决定回村向群众反省检讨，并定出以下办法坚决执行：（一）普遍建立民选的村财政管委会，村长、政治主任、财政主任必须参加。（二）建立预决算制度，向群众公布。通过群众开支。（三）村款生产自给。整顿村公产庙产，或摊派一次经费作基金，投入合作社搞手工业作坊生产。（四）临时开支必须县区批准。村中娱乐号召群众自组剧团，反对花钱演旧剧。至于支差则实行勤工记分制：一、按各家劳、畜力多少定出其差役负担分数，每月结算一次以总出差数按分平均，得出各户应负担数。二、凡十八岁至五十岁男子无论是否干部一律支差，每一人之负担分数为一分，商人与煤矿工人五厘，区以上工作人员、现役军人、教员、荣誉军人、学生、医生与兽医、羊雇工免役。现役军人的父或子，体弱残废酌情减免。畜力一对牙以上之骡马负担二分，驴分半，牛一分，但不同地区可酌情增减。三、出差以负重六十斤，往返六十里为一工，骡负一百二十斤顶两工，驴负九十斤为个半工，赶牲口者顶半工，兼负三十斤者亦以一工计。出差超过其负担分者可得工资，不足者出工资，每工工资为米十斤。战勤与生产结合变工，出差一工亦顶生产一工。为奖励牲畜繁殖，牲口产前后免役四月。第五月出近差，种田之公用驴、牛免役。
