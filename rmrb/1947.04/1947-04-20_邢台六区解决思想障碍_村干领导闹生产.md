　　Xingtai Sixth District Solves Ideological Obstacles
    Village Cadres Lead in Production
    [Report from this newspaper] In order to launch a large-scale production campaign, the Sixth District of Xingtai convened an expanded meeting of village cadres on the 5th of this month. The meeting lasted four days, with more than 800 men and women participating. During the four days, cadres and activists, through in-depth self-reflection, resolved several ideological obstacles to large-scale production: (1) Cadres must put down their airs; after the emancipation, some cadres developed hedonistic ideas, became gluttonous and lazy, and put on airs. To engage in production again, how embarrassing that would be! They said: "I am a cadre, how can I still engage in production!" They were unwilling to carry manure, fearing the smell. Some reflected: "Work is an invisibility cloak; originally I became a lazy person." Some were unwilling to work themselves, and deviously asked the masses to do it for them. The leadership, based on the above situation, asked them to trace the roots of this thinking; is this the original thinking? They further reflected, and only then did they realize that the above-mentioned airs and gluttony and laziness were not the original thinking, but the exploiting thinking of the landlords. At this time, the cadres were greatly surprised, and realized that they were wrong. They unanimously believed that labor is the most glorious, and laziness is a disgrace, and proposed not to lose a thousand days of effort in one day. So the cadres said: "We cannot lose the credit of leading the masses to turn over because of this." This stimulated the idea of making new contributions and leading the masses to engage in production. (2) The problem of middle peasants fearing struggle: In the high tide of the mass movement, some middle peasants had the illusion that cutting leeks [referring to being exploited], sooner or later, they would not escape struggle, sooner or later they would be impoverished and would not escape. For example, Wang Runxin, a middle peasant in Fusi Village, fearing struggle, didn't even dig up radishes and sorghum stalks last year, preparing to be struggled against, and only dug up radishes to eat and burned flower stalks. The leadership emphasized and proposed: resolutely do not struggle against middle peasants, and embolden them, at which point they put their hearts at ease. Many middle peasants said: "When we go back, we must work hard and do it on a large scale." The idea of working hard in production then raised its head. (3) The problem of loafers and lazy men: They said: "Doing business in Nanjing and Beijing is not as fast as struggle." For example, Fu Qingquan of Xizhao Village, because he had gained some fruits [of the revolution], slept in every morning. His wife said: "Aren't you going to the fields?" He said that he slept late last night because of the meeting, using the excuse of the meeting to be a loafer at home. After reflection, he said: "If this continues, the future is dangerous. From now on, I will work hard in production and not sleep in." (4) Women's reliance on men: They said: "Eat from your husband, wear from your husband, marry another husband when your husband dies." For example, the chairman of the Women's Rescue Association of Huangsi Temple, Shi Yuzhen, said: "In the past, I only thought that improving the status of women meant eating the same and wearing the same, and women not being beaten or scolded. After these four days of discussion and reflection, I realized that improving the status of women is improved through labor, and it can never be improved through eating and wearing. This kind of bad thinking is also exploiting thinking. When I go back, I will lead women to spin and weave, and achieve equality through labor." At the end of the meeting, the cadres and activists were in high spirits, and all said: "These few days of the meeting, we have put down several burdens, which is very pleasant. When we go back, we will lead the masses to produce again and make a great contribution to getting rich."

　　邢台六区解决思想障碍
    村干领导闹生产
    【本报讯】邢台六区为开展大规模生产运动，特于本月五号召开全区村干部扩大会议，会期四天，男女共八百余人。四天当中，干部积极分子，经过深入反省，解决了障碍大生产的几种思想：（一）干部要放下架子；翻身后，部分干部产生了享乐思想，好吃懒做，摆起架子，再闹生产，可太丢人了，说：“我当了干部，还能闹生产哩！”粪不愿担了，怕臭。有的反省说：“工作是隐身草，原来自己变成了懒汉。”有的自己不愿劳动，转弯抹角的叫群众给做。领导上根据以上情况，让他们追根，这是啥思想，这是不是原来的思想。他们再深入反省，才认识到以上摆架子好吃懒做，不是原来思想，这是地主的剥削思想。这时干部大吃一惊，认识了自己不对。一致认为劳动最光荣，懒汉是耻辱，提出不要千日功劳一日丢。于是干部们说：“咱们领导群众翻身的功劳，不能因此丢掉。”刺激起再立功劳，领导群众闹生产的思想。（二）中农怕斗争问题：在群众运动高潮当中，某些中农产生了错觉，认为割韭菜，迟早饶不了斗争，迟穷早穷饶不过。如阜寺村中农王润新因怕斗争，去年连萝卜、高粱秸都没刨，准备被斗争，去刨萝卜吃，刨花秸烧。领导上强调提出：坚决不斗中农，给他们壮胆，这时他们才把心放到肚哩。许多中农说：“回去可得好好劳动，往大处闹哩。”努力闹生产的思想才抬起头来。（三）二流子赖汉问题，他们说：“南京北京做买卖，不如斗争来的快。”如西赵庄傅清泉，因得到果实，每天早晨睡大觉，老婆说：“你不下地？”他说昨晚上开会睡的迟，借开会的名义在家当二流子。经过反省后，自己说：“这样下去，前途危险，今后要好好生产，不睡大觉。”（四）妇女依靠男人思想：她们说：“吃汉子，穿汉子，死了汉子嫁汉子。”如皇寺妇救会主席，石玉珍说：“过去我光认为提高妇女地位是吃一样穿一样，妇女不受打骂，经过这四天讨论反省后，我才知道，提高妇女地位，是从劳动上提高的，决不能吃穿提高，这种坏思想也是剥削思想，回去领导妇女纺织，要从劳动达到平等。”大会结束，干部积极分子情绪都很高涨，都说：“这几天大会咱们放下几个包袱，非常痛快，回去再领导群众生产，再立发家致富一个大功劳。”
