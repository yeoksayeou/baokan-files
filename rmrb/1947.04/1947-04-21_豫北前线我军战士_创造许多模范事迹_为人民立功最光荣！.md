[This dispatch from the Yubei Front, April 18th] The soldiers of the People's Liberation Army on the Yubei Front, responding to the call of Generals Liu and Deng to "Only win, never lose, it is most glorious to perform meritorious service for the people!" have created many model deeds. The Second Company of a certain unit of the 106th Regiment was assigned the task of assault in the battle of Pangcun. The Fourth Platoon completed its mission without a single casualty. Platoon leader Hu Nian and mutual aid group leader Wang Zengtian were both commended for their bravery and tactical flexibility in combat. New recruit Liu Dengfu was not very active in his work in the past, and was disciplined during the Battle of Cuizhuang. Before the Battle of Pangcun, he said, "To defend Chairman Mao, I must correct my mistakes and perform meritorious service." He repelled the enemy's counterattacks twice and made great contributions. Wang Wenxiang, a medic of the Fifth Company of a certain unit, gave medicine to comrades with blisters on their feet at every resting place during the march, staying up all night to ensure that the entire company completed the forced march. Li Kefu, a cook in the Special Service Company, disregarded his own fatigue during the long-distance forced march, and ensured that the soldiers could wash their feet, drink water, and eat on time. Every time, he volunteered to deliver food to the battlefield. In the half-month of marching and fighting during the Yubei campaign, a certain regiment had 170 soldiers below the rank of platoon leader, including Sun Fuxi and Guo Yuwu, who were recognized for their meritorious service. A certain artillery company had 22 members who were recognized for their meritorious service. Among these heroes are junior commanders, mutual aid group leaders, soldiers, machine gunners, artillerymen, medics, cooks, work models, discipline models, and propaganda models. This regiment participated in five battles, large and small, including Niushitun and Yanjin, this month, capturing a total of 270 Chiang soldiers (including 11 officers), and seizing one small cannon, 11 light and heavy machine guns, and 346 long and short guns.

    创造许多模范事迹
    为人民立功最光荣！
    【本报豫北前线十八日电】豫北前线人民解放军的战士们响应刘邓二将军“只能打胜，不能打败，为人民立功最光荣！”的号召，创造许多模范事迹。一○六部队某部二连在庞村战斗中担任突击，第四班完成任务，没有一个伤亡。班长胡年、互助组长王增田都因作战勇敢、技术灵活立了功。新战士刘登福过去工作不积极，崔庄战斗时曾受到处分，在庞村战斗前他说：“保卫毛主席，一定要改过立功。”他两次击退敌人的反扑，立了大功。某部五连卫生员王文祥在行军中每到驻地，首先给脚上打了泡的同志换药，自己一夜不睡觉，保证全连完成急行军任务。特务连炊事员李克富在长途急行军中，不顾自己疲劳，每次能保证战士洗脚、喝水、按时吃饭，每次都自报奋勇到战场上送饭。某团在豫北战役半个月的行军作战中，仅排级以下干部战士立功者即有孙福喜、郭玉五等一百七十人，一个炮兵连内即有二十二人立功。这些功臣中，有下级指挥员、互助组长、战士、机枪射手、炮兵、卫生员、炊事员、工作模范、纪律模范、宣传模范等，该团本月中参加牛市屯、延津等大小战斗五次，共俘蒋军二百七十名（内军官十一名），缴获小炮一门，轻重机枪十一挺，长短枪三百四十六支。
