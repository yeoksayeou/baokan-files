    Constantly Pay Attention to Changes in the Enemy Situation
    Flexibly Change Forms of Land Distribution
    Land Reform in the Border Areas of Huo County Enters a Climax
    [Report from Taiyue by our newspaper on the 23rd] The land reform movement in Huo County has entered a climax amidst the fierce fighting between the enemy and us, and has created rich experiences. Since the county-wide campaign to kill the enemy and perform meritorious deeds began on March 21st, up to April 5th (a period of half a month), although there were as many as eleven small-scale harassment attacks by the enemy, the masses safely carried out the land distribution struggle under the cover of our entire militia and local military units. For example, Feng Nanyuan and Zhang You in the Fourth District, Yanbi and Beiying in the Third District, Shangdongpo and Xiadongpo in the First District, and Duanzhuang and Yinzou in the Fifth District all launched land distribution struggles under armed cover, and promoted the land distribution movement in the four districts of the county, gradually extending to areas near enemy strongholds. For example, the Fifth District, only two miles away from the enemy, is also conducting liquidation with landlords day and night. The methods of combining armed forces and land distribution are: 1. Armed forces and land distribution advance side by side. With the support of armed forces, the masses promptly launch liquidation against landlords, and the movement quickly advances to the vicinity of the enemy. For example, Duanzhuang is surrounded by several layers of defense lines, including a mine blockade line, a combination obstacle line, and a militia flying line. Whenever the enemy comes out, they are either bombed or shot. Every attack is met with panic and retreat. The masses in the village struggle against the landlords and conduct grievance sessions without any worries. When the enemy attacked Jinbi Village, Yuantou Village, only five miles away from the enemy, the whole village moved to the mountain gully for liquidation. The militia set up three layers of sentries on the mountain to embolden the masses. 2. The organizational form is combat-oriented. For example, in Liuzhuang in the Fourth District and Duancun in the Fifth District, the masses of the whole village are organized into combat-land distribution mixed groups. When the enemy does not come, they continue to conduct liquidation as usual. When the enemy comes, they move outside the village in small groups, taking the struggle objects with them to continue the struggle. No emphasis is placed on holding struggle meetings; liquidation is carried out in small groups. The struggle objects are also liquidated in rotation. 3. Constantly educate the militia and armed village government cadres to become dual heroes in leading the masses to strike the enemy and fight for land distribution. For example, Zhang Yinshan in Shenzhuang, Fusheng and Xiaoju in Jinbi, and Zhang Qiusheng in Shangdongpo have all become the most beloved leaders of the masses in the struggle for land distribution and against the enemy. 4. Cadres leading the mass movement must constantly pay attention to changes in the enemy situation and adapt to the demands of the masses. They cannot proceed step by step like in the old liberated areas. If brewing is ripe, struggle quickly to prevent the enemy from launching a sudden attack and causing the masses to become demoralized. 5. The distribution of fruits mostly adopts the method of the masses keeping them separately, and then distributing them reasonably after the struggle comes to an end; otherwise, if they are concentrated, they are easily snatched away by the enemy.

### 时时注意敌情变化  灵活改变分田形式  霍县边地土地改革进入高潮

    时时注意敌情变化
    灵活改变分田形式
    霍县边地土地改革进入高潮
    【本报太岳廿三日电】霍县土地改革运动，已在敌我激烈斗争的炮火中进入高潮，并已创造丰富经验。该县从三月廿一日全县杀敌立功竞赛以来，至四月五日半月中，敌人之小股袭扰虽有十一次之多，但在我全体民兵与地方兵团的掩护之下，群众安然的进行分田斗争。如四区的冯南园、张有，三区的颜壁、北影，一区的上东坡、下东坡，五区的段庄、阴奏等村，均在武装掩护下，掀起了分田斗争，并推动了全县四个区的分田运动，逐渐伸展到敌人据点附近。如五区距敌仅二里，亦在日夜不息的与地主进行清算。其武装与分田结合办法有：一、武装与分田齐头并进，群众在武装支撑下向地主及时开展清算，运动很快就推进到敌人附近。如段庄周围设有数层战线，有地雷封锁线，有阻碍结合线，有民兵飞行线，敌人一出，不是挨炸，便是挨枪。每次出犯无不惊慌回窜，群众在村中与地主斗争，进行诉苦毫无顾虑。源头村当敌人进攻靳壁村时，距敌仅五里，全村转移到山沟清算，民兵在山头上，放出三层步哨，给群众壮胆。二、组织形式战斗化。如四区的柳庄，五区的段村，全村群众皆编为战斗分田混合组，敌人不来，照常清算，敌人一来以小组为单位转移村外，带上斗争对象继续斗争。不强调开斗争大会，以小组为单位进行清算；斗争对象亦是轮流被清算。三、时时教育民兵与武装村公所的干部，成为领导群众打击敌人与分田斗争的双英雄。如沈庄的张银山，靳壁的富生、小具，上东坡的张秋生等，均是在分田与对敌斗争中成为群众最爱戴的领袖。四、领导群众运动的干部，要时时注意敌情的变化，适应群众的要求，不能像老区一样的按步就班的进行。如酝酿成熟，即迅速斗争，以防敌人突然袭击后群众情绪低落。五、分配果实多采取群众分别保存的办法，待斗争告一段落再合理分配，否则集中起来，容易被敌人抢去。
