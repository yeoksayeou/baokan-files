    Land Distribution in Border Areas of Lingshi
    Attention to Ideological Mobilization
    First and Second Line Establish Joint Defense Pact
    [Our Newspaper Taiyue 23rd Dispatch] Encouraged by the victories in the struggle against the enemy, the land reform movement in Lingshi has deepened from the third line to the second line. Niuwangmiao Village in the first district is very close to the enemy, and the masses have the greatest concerns. Under the protection of armed peasants on the first line, all 55 households in the village, except for three households who were away on business, participated in the struggle. Among them, 20 households locked their doors and brought their entire families, young and old, into the meeting to pour out their grievances. In Zhuangli Village, many problems that had never been resolved were addressed during this grievance session, such as "fate," "who is the root of poverty," and "how the landlords' roots of wealth were established." After extensive grievance sessions throughout the district, another 15 feudal remnants were squeezed out. In Mahe Village in the third district, individual interviews were used to inspire the masses to pour out their bitterness. This started with a single alleyway and quickly spread throughout the village. Based on the development of the work, the county headquarters promptly directed armed cadres throughout the county to: continue sharpening their swords and preparing their horses, strengthen armed struggle on the first line, deepen land reform on the second line, and on the third line, combine production with attacking backward villages.
    [Our Newspaper Taiyue 23rd Dispatch] The first and second lines of struggle in the first district of Lingshi have recently implemented a large-scale joint defense for emancipation, strengthening armed struggle to protect land distribution. At a joint meeting of the two lines, a joint defense pact was specifically established: 1. Each armed headquarters will lay ×× landmines near enemy communication lines and strongholds each month. 2. The second line will supply the first line with ×× stone mines each month. 3. Each armed headquarters will firmly defend the assigned blockade posts. 4. If the enemy is discovered in one village, all villages will provide assistance. The second line will also invite cadres from the old liberated areas on the third line to go and lead them to emancipation. Currently, Dong Village and others on the third line have sent activists such as Hao Changxi and others to Nanwu and other villages to lead the peasants to emancipation.

    灵石边地分田
    注意思想发动
    一、二道线订立联防公约
    【本报太岳二十三日电】在对敌斗争的胜利鼓舞下，灵石土地改革运动已由第三线深入到第二线。一区牛王庙村离敌很近，群众顾虑最大，在第一线武装农民的保护下，全村五十五户，除三户因事外出，全部参加了斗争。其中有二十户全家老少都锁上门，拥入会场诉苦。庄里村在此次诉苦中解决了从未解决的许多问题，如“命运”、“谁是穷根”、“地主的富根是怎样扎的”等。全区在广泛的诉苦后，又挤出十五条封建尾巴。三区马和村在个别访问中，启发群众倒苦水，由一个闾突破，很快普及全村。县指挥部根据工作发展情况，及时向全县武装干部提出：继续秣马厉兵，加强第一线武装斗争，深入第二线土地改革，在第三线则是结合生产突击落后村。
    【本报太岳二十三日电】灵石一区第一、第二两道斗争线近实行翻身大联防，加强武装斗争，掩护分田。在两道线的联席会议上，特订立联防公约：一、每月每个武装指挥部要向敌人交通要道与据点附近埋雷××颗。二、二道线每月供给一道线石雷××颗。三、各武装指挥部坚守所分配之封锁岗位。四、一村发现敌人，村村援助，二道线并请三道线上的老解放区干部前往领导他们翻身。现三道线东村等已派积极分子郝常喜等多人至南吴等村领导农民翻身。
