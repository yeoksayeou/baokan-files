　　Jinnan Bank Second Branch
  　Formulates Measures for Issuing Spring Loans
    The current period is a critical stage for spring plowing preparations. In order to organically and rapidly shift the winter sideline production loans issued last year to spring plowing purposes, and to help the newly liberated poor masses solve the difficulties in spring plowing, the Taihang Second Branch of Jinnan Bank has studied four measures and instructed each county branch to implement them immediately. (1) Generally, the issuance of loans should be stopped except in cases of extreme need. All types of loans that are due should be collected as quickly as possible in order to accumulate funds for spring plowing loans. (2) Existing and uncollected overdue loans should be planned and allocated in approximate amounts. Existing loans should be lent out immediately, and uncollected loans should be collected and lent out simultaneously. Appropriate adjustments should be made between districts and villages, with more consideration given to impoverished areas where land redistribution has not been thorough. Wealthy districts and villages with fewer difficulties should only collect loans and not receive new ones, promoting a focus on priority lending. (3) Collection and issuance should be combined. Bank cadres should go to districts and villages, personally take action, and boldly work through district and village cooperatives, relying on district and village cadres to conduct collection and issuance on a district and village basis. Efforts should be made to ensure that funds do not leave the districts and villages, so as to facilitate timely lending. (4) Loan work should be unified with the overall spring plowing organization work and carried out in conjunction with various departments. Bank cadres should directly participate in spring plowing organization work to conduct loan work. At the same time, the money earned by the masses in winter sideline production and the existing idle funds in their hands should be organized for spring plowing purposes by helping the masses make agricultural production plans.

　　冀南银行二分行
  　订发放春贷办法
    当前正是紧张的春耕准备阶段，冀南银行太行二分行为了使去年发放的冬季副业生产贷款，有机的迅速转移到春耕用途上，帮助刚翻了身的贫苦群众解决春耕中的困难，研究了四项办法指示各县支行，立即进行。（一）一般的贷款除十分需要外皆停止发放，已到期的各种贷款要从速催收，以便积蓄资金转放春耕贷款。（二）现有的及未收起的到期贷款统做有计划的约数分配，随即将现有的贷出，未收回的边收边贷，区与区、村与村并做适当的调剂，多照顾未翻透身的贫困地方，财富雄厚困难较少的区村，光收不贷，提倡贷款重点主义。（三）催收与发放结合进行，银行干部要到区到村，亲自动手并大胆的通过区村合作社，依靠区村干部，以区村为单位进行随收随放，尽可能做到款不离区村，以求贷款便利及时。（四）贷款工作要与春耕全面组织工作统一起来，和各部门结合一致进行，银行干部直接参加到春耕组织工作中去作贷款工作，同时将群众在冬季副业生产中赚到的钱和手里现存的游资，通过帮助群众做农业生产计划，组织到春耕用途上来。
