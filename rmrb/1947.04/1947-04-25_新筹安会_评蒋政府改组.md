    New Preparatory Peace Association
    A Critique of the Restructuring of the Chiang Government

    On April 18th, Chiang Kai-shek announced the restructuring of his government. This day was Chiang Kai-shek's so-called "20th Anniversary of Establishing the Capital in Nanjing," that is, the day Chiang Kai-shek betrayed the people and usurped power. Twenty years ago (1927), on April 12th, Chiang Kai-shek massacred the people's masses who had risen up in Shanghai and had opposed the common enemy together with him, creating the "April 12th" coup. On April 18th, Chiang Kai-shek announced the establishment of the "Central Government," betraying the orthodox revolutionary government in Wuhan at the time. From then on, Chiang Kai-shek launched counter-revolutionary civil wars, massacred millions of people, and invited the invasion of Japanese imperialism. Now, Chiang Kai-shek has chosen this shameful day to "restructure" his so-called "government" to have this "government" preside over "general elections," convene the "National Assembly," and elect a "president," so that Chiang Kai-shek can sit on the throne, in order to complete the transformation of China into an American colony and to maintain the precarious rule of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. And the method is to borrow foreign debts and fight civil wars. But the Chinese people can already see that Chiang Kai-shek's trick of restructuring the government is just a new Preparatory Peace Association inheriting Yuan Shikai's old Preparatory Peace Association. Its characteristics of flattering foreigners, oppressing the people, fighting civil wars, and heading for a dead end will all be similar.

    Chiang Kai-shek's crisis is closely linked to his eagerness to complete the task of turning China into an American colony. Since Chiang Kai-shek betrayed the people on April 18, 1927, and completed the fascist dictatorship, he has been an enemy of the people for twenty years. However, the people's awakening has gradually been achieved through long-term practice. The vast majority of the Chinese people, especially the middle class, have gradually become aware of the Chiang Kai-shek clique's ten years of civil war after the "April 12th" Incident, the loss of sovereignty and national humiliation after the "September 18th" Incident, the retreat and escape, corruption, and degeneration during the eight years of the War of Resistance against Japan, the looting and self-enrichment after Japan's surrender, the launching of civil wars, the signing of the traitorous Sino-U.S. Commercial Treaty, the large borrowing of U.S. debts, the stationing of U.S. troops, the betrayal of the Political Consultative Conference, the unauthorized convening of the "National Assembly," the creation of a pseudo-constitution, the disregard for breaking national unity, and acting as a running dog of U.S. imperialism. This awakening of the Chinese people has aggravated the crisis of Chiang Kai-shek's rule, making Chiang Kai-shek's ruling apparatus unable to exist as before, and making Chiang Kai-shek's deception lose its effect. This is the political crisis of dissatisfaction with Chiang Kai-shek's rule that is universally present among the people. On every battlefield attacking the Liberated Areas, there is nothing but failure. From July of last year to March of this year, in nine months, the People's Liberation Army annihilated as many as seventy brigades of regular troops, and the large number of puppet troops and security forces annihilated have not yet been calculated. This has created a serious military crisis in front of Chiang Kai-shek. Due to the extreme reactionary nature of its financial economy, Chiang Kai-shek's financial crisis and economic crisis are unprecedentedly serious. In short, the Chiang Kai-shek ruling clique is simultaneously in the midst of three major crises: political, military, and economic. In order to save the crisis, they believe that they need to continue borrowing foreign debts and continue fighting civil wars. In this way, the goals of Chiang Kai-shek and American imperialism become completely consistent, which is to turn China into an American colony. Chiang Kai-shek's crisis was created by Chiang Kai-shek himself and intentionally created by American imperialism. Because only by putting Chiang Kai-shek in a serious crisis can China be transformed into an American colony more quickly. Destroying the Political Consultative Conference, launching civil wars, convening the "National Assembly," creating a pseudo-constitution, and "restructuring the government" are all farces directed by the Americans; Chiang Kai-shek's nose is now completely led by the Americans.

    For the United States needs Chiang Kai-shek to help it turn China into its colony, and for Chiang Kai-shek needs the United States to help him save the crisis, they are truly a good pair who need and love each other. Now the Americans say: You should organize a "liberal" government, and I will lend you money to fight. Chiang Kai-shek obeyed orders respectfully, and a so-called "government between political tutelage and constitutionalism" was immediately formed, and a large group of reactionaries actually made their debut.

    This group of reactionaries, headed by Chiang Kai-shek, issued twelve guidelines, of which only two are needed, namely borrowing foreign debts and fighting civil wars.

    The guidelines say: "All foreign debts raised in the future should be designated for stabilizing and improving the people's lives and production and construction." Is this true? No! It is for the purpose of slaughtering the people and destroying production. Chiang Kai-shek had already sent Chiang Ting-wen to the United States to discuss with his foreign father about providing military supplies. In addition to preparing to lend Chiang Kai-shek 500 billion yuan, the U.S. government is also recently brewing a loan of 1 trillion yuan; Truman also wants to allocate 50 million yuan from the so-called "relief funds" to Chiang Kai-shek. After the instructions of the U.S. government, the so-called "Sino-Philippine Friendship Treaty," which had been quite controversial, was suddenly signed. These all indicate that Chiang Kai-shek wants to borrow money from the United States under the pretext of "construction," and then purchase American weapons from the Philippines. The use of the loan is for fighting, not for people's livelihood and production.

    The guideline on fighting civil wars is written as: "The CCP issue should still be resolved politically as the basic principle. As long as the CCP is willing to have peace and railway transportation is fully restored, the government will use political methods to seek domestic peace and unity." The Chinese people should know that the Chinese civil war will continue forever! According to Chiang Kai-shek's logic: "The Political Consultative Conference was destroyed by the CCP, and the civil war was launched by the CCP." Only Chiang Kai-shek in the entire China "is willing to have peace," while "the CCP has never and will never be willing to have peace." Therefore, there is only one way to use force to suppress the "rebellion." This article was also taught to him by Chiang Kai-shek's foreign father. They both want this article, not only showing their attempt to eliminate the democratic forces in China, but also showing that the democratic forces in China are exceptionally strong. The reactionaries fear the side of their own failure. Didn't Chiang Kai-shek just announce at his Third Plenary Session that "political resolution is hopeless"? How can it seem that there is "hope" again after only a month? This kind of self-contradiction precisely shows the extreme panic of the reactionaries in front of the people.

    The group gathered in Chiang Kai-shek's government is said to be: "progressive-minded" and "liberal elements." Among them, the Americans especially like Zhang Qun; the Chinese people are no stranger to Zhang Qun. He was originally the main character of the Northern reactionary faction who carried out the "Political Northern Expedition" during the Northern Expedition period. He was the old pro-Japanese faction famous with Huang Fu and Yang Yongtai, and the head of the political science department of financial tycoons and bureaucratic groups. Now he has become the baby of American imperialists. In addition to a large group of fascist spokespersons such as Zhang Qun and other Kuomintang members, there are also a group of people who have joined the government: a small group of traitors and Pekingese dogs such as Zeng Qi; a small group of the Democratic Socialist Party composed of running dogs of the Northern warlords who have inherited from the royalist research department; several so-called "social elites" such as Wang Yunwu, a shameless broker who is eager to become an official and abandons the Political Consultative Conference. All of these feudal remnants, veteran traitors, and political peddlers are the people that U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Acheson hurriedly came out to express his satisfaction with, and the "progressive-minded elements" praised by the New York Times, the spokesperson of U.S. imperialism.

    All higher powers are in the hands of the Americans, Chiang Kai-shek is just a tool, and people like Zeng Qi are just beggars begging for food from the Americans. Among Chiang Kai-shek's group, the financial resources of the four major families, the military power of the "Revival" system, and the secret service of the "CC" system have the secondary power to truly serve the United States, and other people are just beggars. Beggars can be used to run the show, but they will not really get any power. American imperialists and their running dog Chiang Kai-shek are all misers.

    Does this government still have a deceptive effect? Very, very small. This kind of so-called government is too ugly! At best, it can only take advantage of the weak point that some people have poor memories. When people remember that these so-called "new figures" are ancient reactionaries, when people prove once again from experience that this so-called "three-party government" is just a tool for the U.S. government to exploit and slaughter the Chinese people, it cannot deceive the Chinese people at all.

    Can this government borrow money from the United States? Of course, it can be borrowed. But no matter whether it is 100 billion, 200 billion, or more, the crisis of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group cannot be saved. Since the past 40 billion U.S. dollars have not saved the crisis but have created today's crisis, it can be known that no matter how much foreign debt is borrowed, the crisis of the Chiang group will not be reduced, but will only deepen until it is crushed by the crisis.

    Is this government likely to win battles? We are determined that it will only continue to lose battles and will never win battles. Since 70 brigades of Chiang Kai-shek's regular troops were annihilated in nine months from July of last year to March of this year, it can be inferred that at least about 70 brigades of Chiang's army will be annihilated again in the second nine months after April of this year, and the situation between the two armies will be fundamentally changed.

    Will this government support Chiang Kai-shek as "emperor"? According to the American plan, that is certain; if no unexpected events occur to them. In the fourth year of the Republic of China, in order to become emperor, Yuan Shikai signed the traitorous Twenty-One Demands with Japan, and called an American political rogue, Goodnow, to promote that China should implement an imperial system. Then he called a group of running dogs to call Goodnow a "great politician," organized the Preparatory Peace Association, implemented Goodnow's "theory," and supported Yuan Shikai as emperor. Now, thirty-two years later, Chiang Kai-shek has also signed the traitorous "Sino-U.S. Commercial Treaty" with the United States, and then a political rogue from the United States came to promote that China should have a "government of 'liberal elements' headed by Chiang Kai-shek" as Marshall said. Then he called a group of reactionaries together to "restructure" into such a "government." This is a new Preparatory Peace Association. After the old Preparatory Peace Association appeared, Yuan Shikai soon collapsed. After the new Preparatory Peace Association appears, Chiang Kai-shek's fate will never be better than Yuan Shikai's, maybe even worse, because the power of the Chinese people is many times greater than it was thirty-two years ago. The only difference is the name. Yuan Shikai changed from president to emperor, and Chiang Kai-shek will change from chairman to president. Although the names are different, the essence is the same. First, flattery of foreigners, second, oppression of the people, third, fighting civil wars, and fourth, heading for a dead end. The first three are the causes, and the last one is the result. Are there any Chinese people who do not believe this observation? Please look at the development of historical facts! (Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, 22nd)

### 新筹安会  评蒋政府改组

    新筹安会
    评蒋政府改组
    四月十八日，蒋介石宣布改组他的政府。这一天是蒋介石的所谓“奠都南京二十周年纪念日”，即是蒋介石背叛人民篡窃政权的日子。二十年前（一九二七年），蒋介石于四月十二日屠杀上海起义的曾经和他一道反对共同敌人的人民群众，造成“四、一二”政变。四月十八日，蒋介石宣布成立了“中央政府”，叛变了当时武汉的正统革命政府。从此以后，蒋介石即以反革命内战屠杀几百万人民，招致日本帝国主义的侵略。蒋介石现在挑了这个可耻的日子“改组”他的所谓“政府”，要由这个“政府”主持“大选”，召开“国大”，选举“总统”，使蒋介石坐上金銮宝殿，以利于完成变中国为美国殖民地，以利于维持摇摇欲坠的蒋介石卖国贼集团的统治。而其方法则是借外债与打内战。但是中国人民已可看出，蒋介石这一改组政府的把戏，不过是继承袁世凯旧筹安会的一个新筹安会。其媚外、残民、打内战、走死路等特点，将无一而不相像。
    蒋介石的危机，和他之急于完成变中国为美国殖民地的任务，是密切的联系着的。蒋介石自从一九二七年四月十八日叛变人民，完成法西斯专政以来，二十年中没有一天不是与人民为敌。但是，人民的觉悟却是在长期实践中逐步达到的。中国的广大人民，尤其是中间阶层，是从蒋介石集团在“四、一二”事变以后的十年内战，“九、一八”事变以后的丧权辱国，八年抗战中的退却逃跑、贪污腐化，日本投降以后的劫收自肥、发动内战、签订卖国的中美商约、大借美债、留驻美军、背叛政协、擅开“国大”、制造伪宪、不惜破裂民族团结、充当美帝国主义走狗等事实，逐渐得到觉悟。中国人民这种觉悟，加重了蒋介石统治的危机，使得蒋介石统治机构不能照旧不变的存在下去，使得蒋介石的欺骗失去效力。这就是普遍存在于人民中的不满蒋介石统治的政治危机。进攻解放区的各个战场上，无一处不失败，从去年七月至今年三月九个月中，被人民解放军歼灭的正规军达七十个旅之众，大量伪军、保安部队之被歼尚未计算在内。这就造成蒋介石面前的严重军事危机。因其财政经济的极端反动性，蒋介石的财政危机与经济危机是空前严重了。总而言之，蒋介石统治集团是同时处在政治、军事、经济三大危机之中。为了挽救危机，他们认为需要继续借外债与继续打内战。这样，蒋介石们的目的和美国帝国主义的目的变成完全一致，这就是变中国为美国殖民地。蒋介石的危机是蒋介石自己造成的，也是美帝国主义有意造成的。因为只有使蒋介石处于严重危机之中，才能较快的变中国为美国殖民地。破坏政协，发动内战，召开“国大”，制造伪宪，“改组政府”，这些活剧，都经过美国人的导演；蒋介石的鼻子现在完全牵在美国人手里。
    对于美国需要蒋介石助其变中国为它的殖民地，对于蒋介石需要美国助其挽救危机，真是相需相爱的好一对儿。现在美国人说：你应当组织一个“自由主义”政府，我好借钱给你打仗。蒋介石奉命唯谨，一个所谓“介乎训政与宪政之间的政府”马上组成，一大群反动派居然粉墨登场了。
    这批以蒋介石为首的反动派，发布了十二条纲领，其中只有两条是需要的，这就是借外债与打内战。
    纲领说：“今后所有举办之外债，应指定将为稳定并改善人民生活及生产建设之用”。这是真的么？不！为的是屠杀人民与破坏生产。蒋介石早已派了蒋鼎文到美国去向他的洋爸色商量接济军火，美国政府除了准备借给蒋介石五万万元之外，最近又在酝酿一笔十万万元的借款；杜鲁门又要从所谓“救济费”中拨出五千万元给蒋介石。经过美国政府的指示，曾经颇有争吵的所谓《中菲友好条约》突然签字，这些都是指明蒋介石要以“建设”为理由向美国借债，然后又从菲律滨购进美国武器。借款的用途是打仗，丝毫也不是什么民生与生产。
    纲领中打内战的一条却写成：“中共问题仍以政治解决为基本方针，只须中共愿意和平，铁路交通完全恢复，政府即以政治方法谋取国内的和平统一”。中国人民须知：中国内战是永远打下去了！按照蒋介石的逻辑：“政协是中共破坏的，内战是中共发动的”，全中国境内只有蒋介石“愿意和平”，而“中共则从来与永远都是不愿意和平的”，因此只有以武力讨平“叛乱”之一法。这一条也是蒋介石的洋爸爸教给他的。他们父子俩都要这一条，不但表现他们企图消灭中国民主力量的一面，同时还表现中国民主力量异常强大。反动派惧怕自己失败的一面。蒋介石不是刚刚在他的三中全会上宣布“政治解决已经绝望”么？怎么刚过一个月，又似乎有了“希望”呢？这种自相矛盾，正是表示反动派在人民面前的极大恐慌。
    蒋介石政府里集合的一群，据说是：“有进步思想的”、“自由主义分子”。其中美国人特别喜爱张群；中国人民对于张群并不生疏，他原来就是北伐时期进行“政治南伐”的北方反动派的主要角色，就是与黄郛、杨永泰齐名的老亲日派，就是财阀与官僚集团政学系的头子，现在做了美国帝国主义者的婴儿，除了张群等国民党一大群法西斯代言人以外，加入政府的还有这样一批人物：汉奸狮子狗曾琦等一小群；从保皇党研究系一派相承下来的北洋军阀走狗们所组成的民社党一小群；急于做官慌不择路，背叛政协的无耻掮客王云五等几个所谓“社会贤达”。所有这些封建余孽，卖国老手、政治贩子，就是美国代理国务卿艾其逊慌忙出来表示满意的人物，就是美国帝国主义的代言人纽约时报所称赞的“有进步思想的分子”。
    一切高等权力都掌握在美国人手里，蒋介石只是工具，曾琦等辈不过是从美国人手里讨碗饭吃的叫花子。蒋介石一群中，握有次等权力真能替美国服务的是四大家族的财力，“复兴”系的武力与“ＣＣ”系的特务，其他人物也都不过是叫花子之类。叫花子可用以跑龙套，却不会真正得到什么权力。美国帝国主义者及其走狗蒋介石，原来都是吝啬鬼。
    这个政府是否还有欺骗作用呢？很小很小。这一类的所谓政府太丑恶了！充其量只能利用一部分人们记性不好的弱点。当人们记起了这些所谓“新人物”就是古老的反动派的时候，当人们从经验中再一次证明这个所谓“三党政府”只是美国政府剥削中国人民与屠杀中国人民的工具的时候，它是一点也欺骗不了中国人民的。
    这个政府是否能从美国借得到钱？当然借得到。但是不管借的是十万万、二十万万或更多，蒋介石卖国集团的危机是挽救不了的。既然过去的四十万万美元不曾挽救过危机反而造成了今天的危机，就可知道不管再借多少外债，蒋集团的危机不会减少，只会加深，直至被危机压得粉碎。
    这个政府是否可能打胜仗？我们断定只会继续打败仗，绝对不会打胜仗。既然从去年七月到今年三月九个月内，蒋介石正规军被歼灭了七十个旅，可以推断今年四月以后的第二个九个月内，蒋军至少会再被歼灭七十个旅左右，并把两军形势根本改变过来。
    这个政府是否会拥护蒋介石做“皇帝”？按照美国人的计划，那是一定的；如果不发生出于他们意外的事变的话。民国四年袁世凯为了要做皇帝，和日本订立了卖国的二十一条条约，又叫一个美国政治流氓古德诺宣传中国应当行帝制，然后叫一批走狗把古德诺称为“大政治家”，组织筹安会，实行古德诺的“理论”，拥袁世凯做皇帝。现在事隔三十二年，蒋介石也和美国订立了卖国的“中美商约”，又由美国的政治流氓来宣传说：中国应该有一个如像马歇尔所说的“以蒋介石为首的‘自由主义分子’的政府”，然后叫一批反动派集合起来“改组”成为这样的“政府”。这是一个新筹安会。旧筹安会出现之后，袁世凯不久就垮了台。新筹安会出现之后，蒋介石的命运决不会好过袁世凯，也许比他更坏些，因为中国人民的力量比三十二年前已经大了不知多少倍。所不同的只是名称，袁世凯是由总统改称皇帝，蒋介石将由主席改称总统。名称尽管不同，实质还是一样。一是媚外，二是残民，三是打内战，四是走死路。前三件是因，后一件是果。中国人民中有不相信这个观察的么？请看历史事实的发展吧！（陕北二十二日电）
