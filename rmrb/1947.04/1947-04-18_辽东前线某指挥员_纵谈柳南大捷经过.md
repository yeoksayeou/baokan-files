Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 15th: After the great victory at Liunan, this reporter visited a certain commander at a certain location on the Liaodong Front. He recounted the events leading to the victory as follows:

"To salvage his defeat, Du Yuming mobilized forces under the designation of fourteen divisions, attempting a fourth attack on our Linjiang area. The Deputy Commander of the Northeast Security, Zheng Dongguo, and the commander of the 13th Army, Shi Jue, were stationed in Xinbin to command. The central route was composed of the 89th Division of the 13th Army, newly transferred from Rehe, and the 162nd Regiment of the 54th Division, which served as the main force of the invading army. Their goal was to first capture Sanyuanpu. Their right flank, the 22nd Division, advanced along the Xin (bin) Tong (hua) highway to provide support. Their left flank, composed of the newly transferred 20th Provisional Division from Rehe and a portion of the 54th Division, advanced along the Xin (bin) Liu (he) highway, maneuvering around Wankou Town (30 li southwest of Liuhe), attempting to take Liuhe and then meet up with the central route of the Kuomintang army. Remnants of the 184th Division and other units were also mobilized in the Hailong and Meihekou areas to coordinate. On the 29th of last month, the 89th Division set out from Xinbin and on April 1st, they infiltrated Hongshi Town, 45 li southwest of Sanyuanpu. After luring the enemy deep, our army resolutely defended and blocked them in the strip of land 35 li outside of Sanyuanpu. At this time, the Central News Agency loudly boasted: 'The Communist army is collapsing in a state of panic, and the Nationalist army is occupying Sanyuanpu with courageous action, and supporting Wankou Town.' In reality, they only saw the lights of Sanyuanpu from a distance. When they actually entered Sanyuanpu, it was after they had laid down their weapons.

"At 6:00 AM on the 3rd, our army began its counterattack, launching a large-scale encirclement and annihilation battle centered on Hongshi Town, covering an area of more than 60 li. On the morning of the 3rd, dozens of large cannons and hundreds of small cannons, mixed with hundreds of light and heavy machine guns, roared in unison, causing the Kuomintang army, who were joyfully preparing to enter Sanyuanpu, to respond in panic. After several tens of minutes of fierce artillery fire and infantry assaults, the defending enemy entrenched on the Waifazi mountain area, 10 li south of Sanyuanpu, were annihilated after we destroyed part of them, and they collapsed in defeat. Our army then seized this commanding height, crucial to the overall situation. At the same time, our forces on the left and right flanks also routed the enemy at Xiaotonggou (35 li south of Sanyuanpu) and Liupanjiaguangzi (5 li southwest of Sanyuanpu), forming a north-south pincer attack on the enemy's command headquarters at Zhangjiajie. The enemy's overall situation completely collapsed, and they fled in disarray towards Hongshi Town and Lanshan, more than 40 li southwest of Sanyuanpu. Our attacking forces on the left and right flanks had also arrived to block the retreat, completely encircling this invading Kuomintang army, annihilating and capturing more than 8,000 men, including Deputy Division Commander Zhang Xiaotang, Political Director Qin Shijie, and more than ten other officers. All the American weapons and equipment of the invading army were seized by us. From the start of the counterattack to the end of the battle took less than ten hours, and the fierce fighting only took three hours to resolve the battle. Another unit of our army blocked the attack of the Kuomintang army's 20th Provisional Division and other units in the direction of Wankou Town, annihilating part of them and defeating the rest. At that time, a platoon of their 162nd Regiment staged an armed uprising on the battlefield." At this point, the commander smiled at the reporter and said: "The 13th Army is Chiang Kai-shek's direct line, fully equipped with American weapons, and often prides itself on being the first to enter the Northeast. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, under the command of the ever-defeated General Tang Enbo, the army retreated all the way from Henan to Guizhou. This time, they came from thousands of miles away, originally Du Yuming wanted to use this ace card to save the situation, but unexpectedly, it was annihilated by our army in a few hours." In this battle, the Kuomintang officers and soldiers showed two characteristics:

First, morale was low, and they were all willing to lay down their weapons. When their command headquarters lost its ability to command, the middle and lower-ranking officers themselves ran out to gather the troops and lay down their weapons, shouting all over the mountains and fields, "So-and-so company come over here," "So-and-so company gather here"! They were quite familiar with the Democratic Allied Army and naturally said: "We know your policies." When withdrawing from the front lines, the Democratic Allied Army did not use many escorts, but only told them to gather at Sanyuanpu. They were afraid that the road would be difficult to travel and asked for route slips, and they arrived at the designated location on time in companies and battalions with the route slips. Second, the officers and soldiers who laid down their weapons were unwilling to go back. The Democratic Allied Army released more than 20 people on the spot. They all cried and refused to go back, saying: "If we go back, we will still be dictatorship soldiers," "We don't want to be dictatorship soldiers, we are willing to be Eighth Route soldiers!" Finally, they repeatedly asked, "If we can't go back, can we come back?"

　　辽东前线某指挥员
    纵谈柳南大捷经过
    【新华社东北十五日电】柳南大捷后记者于辽东前线某地走访某指挥员承告此次获胜之经过如下：
    “杜聿明为挽回其败势，动员了十四个师番号的兵力，企图第四次进攻我临江地区，由东北保安副司令郑洞国及十三军军长石觉驻新宾指挥，其中间之一路即为新近从热河调来的十三军之八十九师与五十四师之一六二团，此为进犯军的主力，目的在首先夺取三源浦。其右翼二十二师沿新（宾）通（化）公路前进以为策应。其左翼则为新从热河调来的暂二十师与五十四师一部沿新（宾）柳（河）公路前进，迂回湾口镇（柳河西南三十里），企图打下柳河后与中路蒋军会师。海龙、梅河口一带，更有一八四师残部等出动配合。上月二十九日，八十九师自新宾出发，于四月一日进窜三源浦西南四十五里的红石镇，我军于诱敌深入后，遂以顽强守备，将其阻击于三源浦外围三十五里的带形地带，此时中央社即大肆吹嘘谓：“共军狼狈溃退，国军以勇猛动作占领三源浦，并策应湾口镇。”实际上他们只是从远远的地方看到三源浦的灯光而已，当他们真正进入三源浦的时候，已为放下武器以后。
    “三日拂晓六时，我军即开始反击，并以红石镇为中心进行方圆六十余里之大规模包围歼灭战。三日晨，数十门大炮、数百门小炮夹杂着数百挺轻重机枪响成一片，使正在兴高采烈准备进入三源浦的蒋军，仓惶应战，经过数十分钟的猛烈炮击与步兵冲锋，据守三源浦南十里之歪垡子山地之守敌，为我歼灭一部后不支溃退。我军遂夺取了此一关系全局的制高点。左右两翼我军亦于同时击溃了小通沟（三源浦南三十五里）、六盘家光子（三源浦西南五里）之敌，形成南北夹击敌指挥部之张家街，敌军之全局遂完全混乱，豕突狼奔，齐向三源浦西南四十余里之红石镇、蓝山一带溃退，我左右两翼之攻击部队亦已赶至，实行堵击，遂将此路进犯蒋军整个包围，歼灭俘获八千余人，其中并俘副师长张校堂、政治主任秦世杰等将校十余名，该进犯军所有美式武器装，全为我缴获。自开始反击到结束战斗不到十小时，而激战只三小时即解决战斗。我军另部于湾口镇方面堵击住蒋军暂廿师等部的进攻，并歼灭其一部以至击溃他们为止，当时并有其一六二团一个排于战地武装起义。”至此，该指挥员笑对记者称：“十三军是蒋介石的嫡系，全部美械装备，常以首先进入东北自豪。抗战当中，该军在常败将军汤恩伯指挥下，从河南一直退到贵州，这次不远数千里而来，原是杜聿明想利用这张王牌以挽回颓势的，不料在几小时内即为我军歼灭。”在此役中，蒋军官兵表现了两个特点：
    第一是士气低落，都愿放下武器，当其指挥部失去指挥能力时，中下级军官便自己跑出来集合队伍放下武器，满山遍野的喊着“某连到这边来”、“某连这边集合”！他们对民主联军颇不生疏，很自然的说：“你们的政策，我们都知道。”下火线时民主联军没有用很多押俘人员，只告诉他们到三源浦集合，他们怕路上不好走要求给开路线条，他们拿着路条成连成营的按时到达指定地点。第二就是放下武器的官兵都不愿回去，民主联军曾当场释放了二十多人。他们都哭着不愿回去，说：“我们回去还得当独裁兵”，“我们不当独裁兵，我们愿意当八路！”最后，他们还再三询问“我们要是回不去，还能回来吗？”
