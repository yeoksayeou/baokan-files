　　[This newspaper, Yu-Wan-Su, 12th dispatch] A unit of the Yu-Wan-Su People's Liberation Army, inspired by the example of five lightly wounded soldiers, crossed the New Yellow River at dawn on the 10th, liberating Fugou County, east of Xuchang on the southern section of the Ping-Han Railway. This is the fourth county town liberated by the Yu-Wan-Su army and people through heroic counter-"encirclement and suppression" operations since late last month. Our army completely annihilated the entire training corps and security team of the Fifth Special Commissioner's Office under Chiang Kai-shek, killing or wounding some and capturing 300 men and rifles, four light and heavy machine guns, and many other military supplies.
　　[This newspaper, Taiyue Frontline, 12th dispatch] After recovering Houma, a certain unit of our army, with a spirit of responsibility overcoming fatigue, completed complex tasks such as battlefield observation, combat review, and commendation within a day and a half after the battle (from the 7th to the morning of the 8th), creating a "three-in-one" working method, and quickly improving the military and political quality of the troops. First, they used the mornings and evenings to gather all military cadres above the platoon level to inspect every major and minor key point in the battle. Commanders at all levels at each key point in the battle reported on the spot their deployments, the course of the battle, and their experiences and lessons learned, followed by a brief exchange of opinions by everyone. The regimental, battalion, and company commanders were the main reporters. All commanders and fighters reviewed their loyalty, wisdom, and discipline in this battle. They democratically discussed who was the hero of this battle and whether any casualties could have been avoided or were worthwhile. The soldiers discussed in units of platoons or squads, and the cadres elected heroes in units of companies, and commendations were conducted.
　　[This newspaper, Taiyue, 12th dispatch] A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army recently launched a new heroic movement—the "Four Goods" movement. (1) Good at fighting: carefully assess the enemy's situation, think of more ways, concentrate wisdom, be brave and proactive, and do a good job. Fight at the front and train at the rear, constantly accepting lessons learned in battle, so as to achieve great victories and few casualties. (2) Maintain good battlefield and mass discipline: carry forward the tradition of not taking a single needle from the masses, resolutely obey orders, all supplies are turned over to the public, and absolutely do not search the pockets of prisoners. (3) Consolidate the troops well: strive for no desertions and fewer illnesses, and use all gaps to practice martial arts and study politics, always maintaining vigorous fighting morale. (4) Good unity and mutual assistance: whether between superiors and subordinates, among various troops, and in relations with the local community, strive for harmony as one. Be strict with oneself and lenient with others, respect government personnel, and assist friendly neighboring troops. This movement has now begun to ferment among all commanders and fighters; in the most tiring marches or rests, soldiers can be seen in groups of three or five discussing how to achieve these four goods. "Guarantees" are constantly being sent to party committees at all levels, and they are handing over their accumulated wealth to show their determination. Qiao Ziming, the squad leader of the first squad of the first company, handed over his merit certificate and hero badge to the organization and said, "This time I am determined to fulfill the Party's call and be a people's hero! If I can't do it, return my hero badge and merit certificate to the higher authorities."
　　[This newspaper, Taiyue, 10th dispatch] While the masses in the rear of the entire district are enthusiastically supporting our army's operations in southern Shanxi, the Yu School organized a war zone service group, and 73 people signed up for it at one time. Later, due to age and physical limitations, 18 strong, intelligent, and brave young students were carefully selected to form the group, led by Li Chun and Yang Jijun, teaching affairs officers of the school, to go to the front line in southern Shanxi.

    【本报豫皖苏十二日电】豫皖苏人民解放军一部，以轻伤五人范例，于十日拂晓越过新黄河，解放平汉南段许昌以东的扶沟县城。这是上月下旬以来，豫皖苏军民英勇进行反“清剿”解放的第四座县城。我军共歼蒋记第五专署集训总队及保安队全部，除毙伤者外，生俘人枪各三百，缴轻重机枪四挺，其他军用品甚多。
    【本报太岳前线十二日电】收复侯马的我军某部，在战斗结束后一天半内（七日到八日上午），以责任心战胜疲劳的精神，完成了阵地观察、战斗检讨、评功等复杂工作，创造出三位一体的工作方式，很快的提高了部队的军事政治质量。首先他们利用早晨与傍晚，集合全部班以上军事干部，视察战斗中每个大小关键。由战斗中各关键的各级指挥人员就地报告自己布置与战斗经过及其经验教训，然后由大家交换简要的意见。且以团营连指挥员为主要报告人。所有指战员都检讨自己在此次战斗中的忠勇、智谋、纪律等。民主讨论何人是此次战斗中的英雄，何人的伤亡是否可以避免或有无价值等。战士们以班或排为单位讨论、干部以连为单位选举英雄，进行贺功。
    【本报太岳十二日电】人民解放军某部最近开展了一个新英雄主义运动——四好运动。（一）打仗好：周密估计敌情，多想办法，集中智慧，勇敢积极，做好工作。前边打，后边练，不断接受战斗中经验教训，作到胜利大、伤亡小。（二）战场和群众纪律搞好：发扬过去秋毫无犯的传统，坚决服从命令，一切物资归公，绝对不搜俘虏的腰包。（三）部队巩固好：争取无逃亡、少疾病，利用一切空隙进行练武，学习政治，永远保持旺盛的战斗士气。（四）团结互助好：无论上下级同志间，各部队间，以及与地方关系，要做到融洽如一体。对己严，对人宽，要尊重政府人员，援助友邻部队。这一运动现已开始在全体指战员中酝酿；在最疲乏的行军中或休息中，随时随地都可以看到战士们三五成群的在讨论如何做到这四好。“保证书”不断向各级党委送来。并纷纷交出自己的积蓄财物，以示决心。一中队一班长乔子明向组织缴出了他的功劳证和英雄章说：“我这一次定要完成党的号召，作一个人民功臣！做不到时，把我的英雄章和功劳证都归还上级。”
    【本报太岳十日电】全区后方群众热烈支援晋南我军作战时，豫中学校组织战地服务团，一时报名者达七十三人。后因年龄体格限制，精选十八名身体强壮、精明悍勇的青年学生组成，由该校教导干事李春、杨吉俊率领奔赴晋南前线。
