　　Cadres Take the Lead in Unifying Mass Thought
    Shexian County Universally Plants Trees
    [Report from Shexian by our newspaper] In Zhuangshang Village, District One, thanks to the active mobilization of Production Director Li Youcai, Village Head Liu Xingrong, and Political Director Liu Qingwen, the masses have launched a tree-planting campaign. They used various occasions, such as eating with idlers, in the market, in people's schools, and at large meetings, to publicize the campaign to different people in different ways. For example, they told the old men that they were planting trees for the benefit of their grandchildren, the children that they were planting for themselves, and the young and middle-aged that they were planting to build a new society. Among the women, they suggested a competition to see who could plant more than their husbands, thus inspiring the masses to consciously plant trees. In addition to the above methods, they went to people's schools for discussions. After the masses understood the importance, they raised the issue of the lack of saplings. As a result of the discussions, each household voluntarily contributed two saplings to plant in public areas, while they took care of their own land themselves. Those without saplings could exchange firewood (pound for pound) with those who had them. The method of planting was to take half a day to plant public trees, and to plant one's own trees during breaks from farming. The people's school decided that each person should plant at least five trees, guarantee the survival of three, and strive to have every tree survive. The village population of one thousand four hundred and twelve people was to guarantee the survival of four thousand two hundred and thirty-six trees, and also plant eight hundred public trees, for a total of five thousand trees planted by the whole village. Production Director Li Youcai, barefoot and with his trousers rolled up, personally planted more than ten trees in the water, which further encouraged the masses. Fifty-one men planted more than four hundred trees, fifty-nine children planted more than three hundred trees, and under the leadership of comrades Ren Manqing and Chen Fengxian, eight women planted twenty or thirty trees. In total, over seven hundred and eighty trees were planted in half a day. After planting, a ditch was dug beside the road to make it difficult for passersby to shake the trees easily. Each tree was marked with red soil and numbered to attract the attention of the masses and discourage them from damaging the trees. Two large wooden signs were erected on the road, advising passersby not to damage the trees easily. Two children were stationed daily to patrol, combining this with collecting manure, taking turns patrolling. (Zhong Yuan)
    [Another report] After the Second District Administrative Office issued a call to action, a widespread mobilization for tree planting began. Everyone understood the benefits and necessity of planting trees. At the same time, district and village cadres, comrades from government offices, and labor heroes took the lead, and tree planting became a mass movement. Old men, children, and women all participated. Old man Chen Guicai's family of six planted forty-seven trees, Wang Fuwang's family of three planted fifteen trees, and Chen Benren's family of four planted sixty-seven trees. The whole village planted a total of one thousand three hundred and forty trees. The village cadres seized on these achievements and immediately held a conference, praising these three individuals. The next day, the whole village planted another eight hundred and fifty-seven trees, for a total of two thousand one hundred and ninety-seven trees planted in two days, an average of more than three trees per person. Production Director Zhang Shixing of Tanyin first resolved the masses' ideological concerns. His own family of three planted twenty-three trees. Yang Yuxiu filled his own land with trees and then planted eleven trees on public land. The whole village, with nine hundred and forty-three people, planted a total of one thousand two hundred and ten trees. A newly wealthy farmer in Taocheng planted three hundred pepper trees at once. Children from a school in Gaojiazhuang planted hundreds of willow trees. The district office, including the correspondents, planted sixty trees with ten people. Suobao planted eight hundred trees, and District Chief Liu cut down trees for the masses and planted forty trees. According to statistics from fifteen villages and seven government offices: ten thousand eight hundred and ninety-nine people planted fifteen thousand five hundred and one trees. The villages are continuing to plant trees. (Lu Qing, Mi Huan)
