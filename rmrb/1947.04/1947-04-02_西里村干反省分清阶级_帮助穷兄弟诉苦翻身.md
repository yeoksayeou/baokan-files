　　West Li Village Cadres Reflect, Distinguish Class Lines, Help Poor Brothers Complain and Overturn Their Fate
    [Our Newspaper Yao Shan News] Chen Zuo Dang, a local tyrant in West Li Village, Yao Shan, nicknamed "Hard to Get by the Devil," was a notorious villain with seventy mu of good land, living entirely by exploiting others. He served as the village chief for fourteen years, known as the "Iron-Headed Village Chief." After his death in 1944, his son Chen Wen continued his father's business, often oppressing the poor. During the Japanese occupation in 1937, due to heavy burdens, he wrote ten mu and five fen of his own land under the name of Chen Geda, a poor man. Chen was forced to pay taxes, his mother died of anger, and his wife became ill with worry. Geda's eldest son, Heshang, joined the Eighth Route Army to seek revenge and gloriously sacrificed his life. During famine years, the family ate only one meal a day, but the tax arrears were still frequently demanded, leading to either three days of empty pots or two days of doors being removed. The area was liberated the year before last, and Chen Geda wanted to complain, but the village cadres, deceived by Chen Wen's wining and dining, ignored him. During the mass movement last year, the village cadres dealt with it perfunctorily, and it was not resolved. On March 22nd this year, after reflecting, the village cadres cleared their minds, realizing they had "eaten the rice and forgotten the rice growers" and had let down the martyr Heshang. They immediately held a mass meeting, and Chen Geda and his family all poured out their grievances. Incensed by the public's anger, Chen Wen was bound and sent to the county government, and compensation was made for ten years of losses. Years of unjust accounts have finally been settled today.

　　西里村干反省分清阶级
    帮助穷兄弟诉苦翻身
    【本报尧山讯】尧山西里村恶霸陈左当，外号“鬼难拿”，是个顶天立地的大坏蛋，有七十亩好地，全靠剥削人过活，担任村长，一直干了十四年，又称为“铁头村长”，民国三十三年死后，其子陈文继父业，仍经常苦害穷人，在民国二十六年敌占时，因负担重，把自己的地十亩零五分，写在穷人陈疙瘩名下，陈被税款所逼的，母因气而死，妻子气病，疙瘩大儿和尚，为报仇参加了八路军，不久光荣牺牲。灾荒年时，家里一天吃一顿饭，但差款还是经常要，不是三天拔锅，就是两天摘门。前年该地解放了，陈疙瘩要诉冤，村干因受了陈文的骗，请吃请喝，村干不管，去年群运时，村干马虎的管了一下，也没了结，今年三月廿二日，村干反省后，打通了思想，认为“吃米忘了种谷人”，对不住烈士和尚，当即开群众大会，陈疙瘩一家人都诉了苦。在群情激怒下，将陈文捆送县政府，并赔偿十年来之损失。数年冤枉账，今朝才算清。（子真）
