　　Jinnan Second Administrative Office Supports Mass Production:
    Distributes 17 Million Spring Loans
    [This newspaper's dispatch from Jinnan on the 30th] In order to solve the difficulties faced by the liberated masses in spring plowing, such as lack of cattle, farm tools, and fertilizer, the Second Administrative Office has issued loans totaling 17 million yuan. The loan villages are designated as those with better land reform, villages already engaged in production, or disaster-stricken villages and small, impoverished villages with more difficulties. The loan recipients are poor farmers and newly rising middle peasants with higher production enthusiasm and more difficulties, as well as old middle peasants who suffered losses in mass movements and have production difficulties. To ensure that the loans truly reach the poorest farmers who need them most, the Qinghe County government reviewed the shortcomings in last year's agricultural loans: such as considering the task completed once the loans were issued, with many not reaching the poor farmers, loans being dispersed and ineffective, and some village cadres embezzling for personal gain or covering village expenses, etc. Based on this, the poorest Third District was designated as the key area, with each district required to find key villages, and each household to receive 3,000 to 20,000 yuan in loans. The loans should be carefully evaluated by the farmers' association, following the mass line, and thorough inspections should be carried out after the loans are issued to correct deviations at any time.

　　冀南二专署扶助群众生产
    发放春贷一千七百万
    【本报冀南三十日电】二专署为解决翻身群众春耕中耕牛、农具、肥料等困难，特发放贷款一千七百万元。贷款村庄规定为土地改革较好，进入生产的村庄或困难较多的灾荒村、小穷村。贷款对象是生产情绪较高与困难多的穷农和新上升中农及在群运中受损害而在生产上有困难的旧中农。为使贷款真正贷到最困难贫农手中，清河县府检讨了去年农贷中缺点：如贷款下去就算完成任务，很多没贷到贫苦农民手中，贷款分散，起不到作用，个别村干中饱自用或顶了村差等。据此确定最贫困的三区为重点区，每区应找重点村，每户要贷到三千元至两万元。认真由农会评议，走群众路线，贷后要深入检查，随时纠正偏向。
