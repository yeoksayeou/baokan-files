Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 7th. The Dazhong Daily published an editorial on the 2nd entitled "Establish Military Transportation and Stretcher Teams," stating: Based on the experience of several months of self-defense war, the Provincial Frontline Support Committee has decided to adopt a long-term military service system, establishing military transportation and stretcher teams for a term of one year. This is better than the previous method of mobilizing civilians whenever needed, mobilizing them to a certain area when there was a battle, and then returning home after the war, as well as the periodic rotation system adopted in some places later, with changes every month, two months, or three months. This method has the following three advantages: First, because the transportation and stretcher teams operate with the army for a long time: (1) The civilians are familiar with the work, and the work efficiency can be improved. (2) The civilians are familiar with the battlefield situation and have battlefield experience, which can reduce injuries and losses. (3) The troops, because the transportation and stretcher teams are always with them, reduce the concerns about the lack of civilian manpower, and can concentrate on combat. With these three advantages, our chances of victory are greater. Second, it greatly reduces waste: (1) Mobilizing one person can yield the effectiveness of one person, and eating one share of public grain will have one person's worth, unlike in the past where more people were mobilized, more public grain was consumed, but fewer were actually used. (2) Once a mobilization and organization is done well, as long as attention is paid to consolidation and replenishment, the burden on local work cadres is reduced. (3) Because one person can be used for one person's worth, the number of people mobilized is greatly reduced, and more labor can be left to engage in production. Third, the lives of the civilians can be improved, and their families can receive preferential treatment, reducing concerns: (1) According to regulations, the military transportation and stretcher teams, during their service, receive the same treatment as soldiers. In other words, in addition to improvements such as food, the government is also responsible for clothing, shoes, and socks, and their lives are improved. (2) The families of the military transportation and stretcher teams receive the treatment of military families during their service and receive preferential treatment from the local areas. Because the number of people is reduced, they can of course receive practical care. (3) Because of the long-term service with the army, the care from the troops will inevitably be more cordial.

　　山东大众日报著论列述随军担架好处
    【新华社山东七日电】二日大众日报以《建立随军运输队及担架队》为题发表社论称：根据几个月自卫战争的经验，省支援前线委员会决定采取长期的随军服务制度，建立为期一年的随军运输队与担架队，这比过去随时需要随时动员，某一地区要打仗，就动员民夫到那里去，战争一过即回家，以及后来有些地方采用的定期轮流制，一个月两个月或三个月一换等办法更好。这一办法有下列三个优点：第一、由于运输队、担架队长期随军行动：（一）民夫熟悉业务，工作效率可以提高。（二）民夫熟悉战场情况，有战场经验，可以减少伤害损失。（三）部队方面因运输队、担架队随时随同行动，减少了缺乏民力使用的顾虑，可以安心作战。有了三个好处，我们取得胜利的可能就更大。第二、大大减少了浪费：（一）动员一个人就可以收一个人的效力，吃去一份公粮就有一个人作用，不像过去动员得多，耗费公粮多，实际用上的少。（二）一次动员组织好之后，只要注意巩固与补充，减轻了地方工作干部的负担。（三）因为一人可收一人之用，动员人数大大减少，可以留下更多的劳动力从事生产。第三、民夫生活可以改善，家属得到优待，减少了顾虑：（一）照规定，随军运输队担架队在服役期间，其本身与战士同等待遇。换句话说，除食粮等改善之外，公家还负责衣服鞋袜，生活得到改善。（二）随军运输队担架队的家属，在服役期间照军属待遇，得到地方上的优待，因为人数减少，当然可以得到切实照顾。（三）因为长期随军，部队的照顾也必然比较亲切。
