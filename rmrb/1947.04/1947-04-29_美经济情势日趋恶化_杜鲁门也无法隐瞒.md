　　US Economic Situation Worsening Day by Day
    Truman Cannot Hide It Either
    【Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 25th】According to the US Information Service: Truman delivered a lengthy speech at the Associated Press annual luncheon in New York on the 22nd, elaborating on his foreign expansion policy and the domestic economic situation in the United States, and asking American newspapers to serve his policies. Regarding the increasingly deteriorating economic situation in the United States, Truman could not hide it either. He said: "A cloud is looming over the economic future of the United States." He revealed: "Since 1945, the surge in wholesale prices has been even more dangerous than the rise in retail prices. For example, textiles have risen by 39 percent, agricultural products by 40 percent, housing construction materials by 51 percent, and food by 53 percent." "Civil servants, widows, veterans, and millions of families in small towns and villages across America are using their limited savings, selling wartime bonds, not seeking medical treatment when sick, and borrowing from everyone they meet due to high prices; the amount of borrowing is 30 to 50 percent higher than a year ago." Truman believes that this is "a fatal blow to the foundation of American prosperity," and then he issued a panicked lament: "If we 'continue to maintain excessively high prices, the result will be a halt to purchasing, a drop in production, and rampant unemployment.'" He said this and that, and the conclusion is to hope that capitalists will be "moderate" and that workers "must be patient" and farmers "must make comprehensive efforts." The so-called "patience" and "comprehensive efforts" are nothing more than asking them to tighten their belts and work harder, and to let the capitalists extract them "moderately."

　　美经济情势日趋恶化
    杜鲁门也无法隐瞒
    【新华社陕北二十五日电】据美新闻处讯：杜鲁门二十二日在纽约美联社周年午宴上发表长篇演说，阐述他的对外扩张政策及美国国内经济情形，要求美国报纸为他的政策服务。对于美国经济情势的日趋恶化，杜鲁门也无法隐瞒，他说：“有一种云翳正在笼罩着美国的经济前途。”他透露了：“一九四五年以来，批发价格的激增，甚至较零售价格的高涨更为危险。例如织造物上涨了百分之三十九，农产品上涨了百分之四十，房屋建筑材料上涨了百分之五十一，食物上涨了百分之五十三。”“公教人员、寡妇、退役军人，几百万美国城市小镇乡村里的家庭，为了物价高涨，动用有限储蓄，卖掉战时证券，有病不就医，逢人便举债；比起一年前，借债的数目多过百分三五十。”杜鲁门认为这“对美国繁荣的基础是致命的打击”，继而他发出了惶恐的悲鸣：“如果‘继续维持过高物价，结果是购货停止，生产跌落，失业猖獗。’”他说去说来，结论是希望资本家“温和”一点，要工人“必须忍耐”，农人“必须全面努力”，所谓“忍耐”与“全面努力”，无非是要他们捆紧肚皮加紧劳动，听任资本家的“温和”榨取而已。
