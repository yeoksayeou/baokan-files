Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 10th: The Liaodong Democratic Allied Army Headquarters has recently announced the detailed results of the Liunan Great Victory on the 3rd as follows: In this battle, our army annihilated the entire 89th Division of the Chiang Kai-shek's Thirteenth Army and the 162nd Regiment of the 54th Division at Honglazi and Youfangjie in Henan within ten hours, with a casualty ratio of one to eighty. The enemy casualties included more than 300 men below the rank of regimental commander. 7,644 enemy soldiers were captured, including Zhang Xiaotang (formerly mistakenly reported as Zhang Xuetang), the deputy division commander of the 89th Division, and Tai Shi, the director of the division's political department. We captured ten mountain guns, eighteen anti-tank guns, thirty-three rocket launchers, thirteen mortars, fifty 60mm mortars, thirty-eight heavy machine guns, two hundred and ten light machine guns, five hundred and twenty-eight submachine guns, two thousand three hundred and eighty rifles, fifty-four pistols, twenty-three automobiles, three camels, six hundred and thirteen horses, ten radio stations, one hundred and seventy-two telephones, seven switchboards, and 670,000 Chiang currency. Furthermore, in the battles where our army routed the remnants of the Chiang army's 93rd Army Temporary 20th Division and the 184th Division of the 60th Army at Ankouzhen (south of Liuhe) and Xiejiaying (north of Liuhe), we killed or wounded 364 enemy soldiers, captured more than 200 alive, and seized fourteen light machine guns, three artillery pieces, and fifty-two submachine guns.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 10th: During the Liunan Great Victory, the people in the newly recovered areas enthusiastically supported the Democratic Allied Army. Kou, the village head of Shengcun, near the front line, hobbled around, his leg injured by Chiang's army, mobilizing more than twenty stretchers, ready for use at any time. When the masses heard the sound of cannons, every household was busy boiling water and cooking. Old man Lu personally carried rice to the front line. Seeing the soldiers from afar, he disregarded the muddy ground and rushed to greet them with rice and soup, urging them to eat and drink. Women in a certain village rushed to make more than 20,000 catties of cakes in a few hours and sent them to the front line. More than 3,000 people from the Sanyuanpu area traveled back and forth between the front and rear, busy transporting ammunition after the battle began. An old man Chen, over seventy years old, repeatedly asked to drive his own ox cart to the front line and transported ammunition three times in a row. On the way home, he told everyone the news of the victory: "No matter how many Du Yuming sends, we will capture them all. This time, another seven or eight thousand were captured."
    Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 10th: Our correspondent on the Liaodong front reports: During the Liunan campaign, the Democratic Allied Army universally implemented the policy of treating captives well. Before the battle, all units of the army made the implementation of the preferential treatment policy one of the challenge conditions and criteria for meritorious service. After the Chiang soldiers laid down their arms, our commanders and fighters first asked if they had lost any personal belongings. Immediately, satisfactory answers of "No", "Not at all" resounded. Wang Yongfa, the second platoon leader of a certain battalion, saw that many Chiang soldiers were ragged and had broken shoes. He immediately ignored his combat fatigue and personally went to the mountains to find backpacks lost or abandoned by fleeing Chiang soldiers and gave them to them. For those who were injured, our medics gave them medicine and bandages one by one, while also serving them rice and water. Seeing this, they were very moved and deeply regretted coming too late. During the escort, Chiang's soldiers talked and laughed freely, as if they had forgotten the sound of gunfire a few hours earlier, and some even happily sang ditties.

　　南满大歼灭战役创一比八十战例
    【新华社东北十日电】辽东民主联军司令部顷公布三日柳南大捷详细战果如下：此次我军在河南之红砬子及油房街，于十小时之内，以一比八十之伤亡对比，歼蒋嫡系十三军八十九师及五十四师一六二团全部，计毙伤敌团长以下三百余，俘八十九师副师长张校堂（前误为张学堂）及该师政治部主任泰世等以下七千六百四十四名，缴获山炮十门、战防炮十八门、火箭炮卅三门、迫击炮十三门、六○炮五十门、重机枪三十八挺、轻机枪二百一十挺、冲锋枪五百二十八挺、步枪二千三百八十支、短枪五十四支、汽车二十三辆、骆驼三匹、马六百一十三匹、电台十部、电话机一七二架、总机七台、蒋币六十七万。又：我军于安口镇（柳河南）及谢家营（柳河北）击溃蒋军九十三军暂二十师及六十军一八四师残部之役中，计毙伤敌三百六十四名，生俘二百余，缴获轻机枪十四挺、炮三门、冲锋枪五十二支。
    【新华社东北十日电】柳南大捷战役中，新收复区人民踊跃支援民主联军。接近前线的升屯，寇村长跛着被蒋军打伤的脚，东奔西跑的动员了二十多付担架，准备随时支用。群众听到炮声一响，家家户户都忙着烧水煮饭。鲁老大爷亲自挑饭上火线，远远的看见战士，便不顾满地污泥，担着饭、汤迎上去，招呼他们吃喝。某村妇女于数小时内，赶做成两万多斤饼子，送到火线。从三源浦区出动的三千余群众，于战斗开始后，往来前后方，忙着运送弹药。有位年逾七十的陈大爷，再三要求赶着自家的牛车上前线，一连运了三次弹药；于回家的路上，逢人便传告着胜利的消息：“杜聿明来多少，就送上多少，这回又被捉来七八千。”
    【新华社东北十日电】本社辽东前线记者报导：柳南战役中，民主联军普遍贯彻了优俘命令。战斗前，部队各单位均将执行优俘政策立为挑战条件与立功标准之一。蒋军放下武器后，我指战员首先询问有无损失私人东西？当即响起：“没有”，“一点也没有”的满意回答。某大队二排长王永发，看见蒋军中有许多人衣褴鞋破，当即不顾战斗疲劳，亲到山上寻找蒋军逃窜遗失放弃的背包送给他们使用。其中有负伤者，我卫生员一一予以上药包扎，同时并替其盛饭倒水。彼等目睹此种情形，甚为感动，深恨自己来得太晚。在押送途中，蒋军士兵谈笑自如，宛似忘却了数小时前的炮火声，有的则愉快的唱起小调。
