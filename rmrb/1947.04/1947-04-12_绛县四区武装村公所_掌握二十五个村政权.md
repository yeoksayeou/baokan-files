[Reported by our Taiyue Correspondent on the 10th] The Fourth District of Jiang County organized three streamlined armed village governments in a comprehensive manner last September to operate deep within the grid network. After six months of active struggle against Chiang's troops, the democratic power of twenty-five villages in the two districts is now under the control of the armed village governments. All government orders can reach villages three miles away from the enemy, and guerrilla bases have been established in villages such as ×× and ××. Last year, Chiang's troops concentrated two battalions to "mop up" the district several times, but were repelled by the armed village governments. On September 10th, more than ten members of the armed village government, led by the old hero Zhang Changfa, engaged in a fierce battle with the enemy for two hours in Shangxia Baima, repelling the enemy and killing or wounding seven enemy soldiers including a company commander. In December, eleven members of the armed village government repelled an attack by two enemy battalions, wounding five enemy soldiers. In six months, the armed village government fought nine major battles with Chiang's troops, killing or wounding thirty-one enemy soldiers. Currently, the area is actively promoting land reform; on the basis of land reform, the militia is being further expanded and pushed towards the Jiangyi Highway.

　　绛县四区武装村公所
    掌握二十五个村政权
    【本报太岳十日电】绛县四区于去年九月组织起三个一揽子形式的短小精干的武装村公所，深入格子网内活动，经过六个月与蒋军积极斗争，至目前两区已有二十五个村的民主政权为武装村公所掌握。政府的一切命令可达距敌三里的村子，并建立了××、××等村的游击根据地。去年蒋军曾集中两营的兵力数次扫荡该区，均遭武装村公所击溃。九月十日，武装村公所十余人，在老英雄张长发的领导下，在上下白马与敌激战两小时，击退了敌人，毙伤敌连长以下七名。十二月间武装村公所队员十一人，又击溃敌两个营的进攻，打伤敌五名。六个月武装村公所与蒋军作战较大战斗九次，毙伤敌三十一名。现该地区正积极推行土地改革；在土地改革的基础上更扩大民兵，向绛翼公路推进。
