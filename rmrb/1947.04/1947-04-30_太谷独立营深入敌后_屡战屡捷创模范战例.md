　　Taigu Independent Battalion Penetrates Enemy Lines
    Repeatedly Wins Victories and Creates Model Examples

    [Reported by this newspaper] The Taigu Independent Battalion has penetrated the enemy's rear and actively engaged in combat. After a month of annihilating enemy forces, it has achieved great success. In addition to打击阎顽侵扰 (striking at Yan Xishan's stubborn resistance), the battalion has also, at the request of local people, cleared out local traitors and bullies. In January, it captured several traitors and counter-settlement leaders, such as Guo Rubiao, Ji Dongsheng, Guo Shuancheng, Guo Cheng, and Guo Cheng's son. These people were all Yan Xishan's lackeys, specializing in oppressing the people, arresting people,抢粮 (robbing grain), and assassinating militia village cadres, committing all kinds of evils. Last year, when Yan Xishan carried out a "水漫扫荡" (water-based mopping-up operation) against our Taigu, they engaged in destructive work everywhere, robbing the people of their property. The news of the capture of Guo and others immediately spread throughout Taigu, greatly delighting the people. The masses said happily: "The Independent Battalion is really our savior, eliminating harm for us old folks and making great contributions!" The battalion has repeatedly won victories in recent battles with the enemy, creating model examples. In the eight battles against enemy strongholds in Houzhuang, Xincun, Wanghaizhuang, Yangyi, Baitie, Shagou, Bainian, and Duncun, they were all victorious, capturing a total of 34 enemy soldiers, including company commanders, instructors, and platoon leaders. On April 9, the 2nd Company of the battalion engaged in a fierce battle with the enemy in Baichengzhen village for half an hour, capturing two machine guns, one small cannon, eight rifles, one Mauser pistol, and capturing 12 enemy personnel, including a顽伪 (stubborn puppet) platoon leader and two squad leaders, killing and wounding 13 enemies, with no casualties on our side, creating a new record of zero to twenty-five.

    [Taixing, Reported by this newspaper on the 26th] The Taigu Independent Battalion, known as the "Banner of Guerrilla Warfare in Central Shanxi," has completed its spring plan to eliminate an enemy platoon more than four times ahead of schedule, eliminating a total of fourteen established squads, 168 people (not including scattered殲敵 (annihilation of the enemy)). Recently, the Third Sub-district summarized the spring struggle against the enemy, and the battalion ranked first in the entire sub-district. Now, the companies, platoons, and squads of the battalion are brewing and discussing new enemy-killing plans to annihilate two more enemy platoons, 72 people, capture one machine gun, one small cannon, 20 rifles, cut more than 1,000 jin of electric wire, and propose a competition to the Shouyang Independent Battalion. According to the battalion's active operations in the Taigu Plains, frequently creating model war examples of few casualties, great victories, and concentrating superior forces to fight small-scale annihilation battles, they often adopt village ambush and flying ambush, as well as the "thunder in the east, rain in the west" tactics. As long as they enter battle, the enemy is kept in the dark and falls into passivity. The soldiers are very skilled and confident in ambush tactics. They often lie in ambush in ruined temples, ruined houses, ruined courtyards,凹道 (sunken roads), walls, streets, and even in the homes of ordinary people. They capture one enemy after another. The soldiers said: "Ambush warfare is sure to win. Action must be calm, news must be well-informed, and steamed buns must be thrown to barking dogs (to prevent the dogs from barking). Once the sons of bitches come up, a grenade explodes and they are captured alive." Recently, due to the development of the 诉苦运动 (speak bitterness movement), the quality of the troops has been further improved. Since November of last year, Yan Xishan's large-scale蚕食 (nibbling away) of the Taigu Plains has been strongly resisted. Recently, they hardly dare to leave their strongholds. Our local work and翻身运动 (turning-over movement [i.e. land reform]) have developed to villages three or five li away from the enemy.

　　太谷独立营深入敌后
    屡战屡捷创模范战例
    【本报讯】太谷独立营深入敌后积极作战，经一个月时间歼灭性的打击敌人，获得很大成绩。该营除打击阎顽侵扰外，并应当地群众要求，清除当地奸霸。一月中，活捉奸霸反倒算头子多名，如郭如彪、冀东生、郭拴成、郭成及郭成子，彼等皆系阎顽的爪牙，专门欺压老百姓，抓人、抢粮、暗杀民兵村干部，无恶不作。去年阎顽向我太谷进行“水漫扫荡”时，彼等到处进行破坏工作，抢劫老百姓资财。此次生擒郭等消息立即传遍全太谷，人心大快，群众高兴的说：“独立营真是咱们的救命恩人，为咱老百姓除害，大大有功！”该营近与敌作战中屡战屡捷，创模范战例。在敌后上庄、新村、王海庄、阳邑、白铁、沙沟、白念、段村等据点八次战斗中，皆获胜利，共活捉连长教官排长以下三十四名。该营二连于四月九日在白城镇村与敌激战半小时，缴获机枪二挺，小炮一门，步枪八支，驳壳枪一支，生俘顽伪排长一班长二以下共十二名，毙伤敌十三名，我无伤亡。创造零比二十五新记录。
    【本报太行二十六日电】被誉为“晋中游击战争旗帜”的太谷独立营，春季杀敌一个排的计划超过四倍提前完成，共计歼敌十四个建制班，一百六十八人（零星歼敌不在内）。最近三分区总结春季对敌斗争时，该营为全分区第一。现该营各连、排、班又酝酿讨论出新的杀敌计划，再歼灭敌人两个排，七十二人，缴机枪一挺，小炮一门，步枪二十支，割电线千余斤，并向寿阳独立营提出竞赛。按该营活跃太谷平川，屡创伤亡少胜利大、集中优势兵力打小型歼灭战的模范战例，经常采取村落伏击与飞行伏击，以及“东面响雷，西面下雨”的作战方法，只要进入战斗，敌人就如蒙在鼓里，陷于被动。战士们对于伏击战术非常熟练而有信心，他们常埋伏在破庙、破房、破院、凹道、墙院、街道甚至老百姓家里，敌人进一个捉一个。战士们说：“伏击战，战必胜，行动要沉着，消息要灵通，狗叫要拿馒头抛（使狗不叫），狗日的上来，手榴弹一响就活捉了。”最近由于开展诉苦运动，部队质量更形提高。阎伪去年十一月以来对太谷平川的大举蚕食，已受到有力还击，最近几乎连据点也不敢出了，我之地方工作与翻身运动，则已发展至离敌三、五里的村庄。
