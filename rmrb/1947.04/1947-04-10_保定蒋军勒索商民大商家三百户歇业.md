Xinhua News Agency, Jinji Luyu, 6th: The people of Baoding are suffering unspeakably under the oppression of Chiang Kai-shek's troops. According to a report by a Tianjin Yi Shi Bao reporter last month, the Baoding city defense works were built by the government "borrowing" 3 billion yuan from merchants and mobilizing all the city's people and woodworking and ironworking technicians. The tangible and intangible consumption of Baoding merchants in completing this project amounted to more than 12 billion yuan. The project is divided into inner and outer city moats. Residents in the suburbs can only move around in the area between the city and the inner moat, one or two li from the city, to shop. Villagers carrying a pack of matches or a bar of soap must present their "National ID" when entering and leaving the city gates and are subjected to body searches by the Self-Defense Forces or the police. The "outer moat," seven li from the city, is even more heavily guarded. All the houses within a few miles outside the moat have been demolished. This "city moat" strictly prohibits farmers from carrying anything. The reporter talked about the lives of the merchants, saying: "Baoding has been exhausted after a 'robbery search' by senior officials and the construction of this project. Most of the merchants' stored grain has been requisitioned. Almost 80 percent of Baoding's major merchants and residents buy and eat on the same day, and very few families can store three days' worth of food." "The population of Baoding has decreased from more than 100,000 to 60,000 or 70,000; of the more than 600 major merchants, half have closed down. Baoding merchants told reporters: If the current situation does not improve, we will all perish together in six months!"

　　保定蒋军勒索商民大商家三百户歇业
    【新华社晋冀鲁豫六日电】保定人民在蒋军压制下苦不堪言。据上月天津益世报记者报导称：保定城防工事，是政府向商民“征借”三十亿元，并且发动全城老百姓和木厂、铁业技术工人们建筑的。这一工事的完成，保定商民有形无形的销耗计达一百二十余亿。该工事分为内外两道市沟，城郊居民往来购物，只能在城市以外市沟以内一二里间的关厢上活动。携带一包火柴、一块肥皂的老乡们，出入城门都必须呈上“国民证”，遭受自卫队或警察混身搜查。离城七里的“外市沟”，更是刁斗森严。壕沟外几里地以内的民房全部被拆毁。这一道“市沟”，严禁来往农民携带一点东西。该报记者谈到商民生活时称：“保定经过一次大员们“劫搜”与这一次修筑工事，目前已经耗尽元气，商民的存粮已大半被征收光了。保定的大商家和住户们，目前几乎百分之八十当天买当天吃，能够储备三天粮食的人家都寥寥可数。”“现在保定的人口已从十余万减少到六七万人；大商家六百余户，歇业的已经有一半。保定商人对记者说：如果现状不改进的话，半年以后要同归于尽了！”
