　　Taiyue People's Liberation Army Advances Victoriously
　　People in Newly Liberated Areas Welcome Them on the Roadsides
　　[Report from the Tongpu Front, April 14th] The Taiyue People's Liberation Army, entering southern Shanxi, has been warmly welcomed by the people along the way. From Yao Village in Jishan to Yumengkou, passing through Chengdu Village, groups of people warmly watched from their doorsteps, and elected representatives to welcome the troops with plates of liquor and cigarettes. They said, "We have long known that the Eighth Route Army is a good army, and we have been looking forward to it for many years. Today we finally see you!" Arriving at Beiyu Town, many families set up tables in front of their doors, placing bowls of boiled water, and warmly invited the troops to drink. In Kangjia Village, Hejin, the people beat gongs and drums and carried a pig to comfort the troops, shouting "The Eighth Route Army will be victorious in the end!" In a small village east of Yumengkou, slogans such as "Welcome the Eighth Route Army that understands and alleviates the suffering of the people" had already been written on the walls. The people of Yumengkou, knowing that the Eighth Route Army had arrived, quickly sent representatives to meet with our cadres, asking kindly what the army needed and what difficulties it faced. Old man Zhang Yongxiang said, "Mao Zedong's troops are a benevolent and righteous army. They were here twenty-four years ago and treated the people very well, so everyone remembers them!" A grocery store owner said, "We have been waiting for you for a long time. If you hadn't come, we wouldn't have been able to survive!"

　　太岳解放军胜利前进中
    新区群众夹道欢迎
    【本报同蒲前线十四日电】进入晋南的太岳人民解放军，沿途备受人民欢迎。自稷山姚村出发到禹门口，路过称杜村，成群结队的老百姓亲热的在门前看望着，并推选代表，端着盘子，盛了烧酒、纸烟欢迎部队。他们说：“我们早知道八路军是好队伍，已经盼望了多少年，今天才盼到了”！到北峪镇，不少人家门前摆着桌子，放着一碗碗的开水，热情的招呼部队喝水。在河津康家庄，老百姓敲着锣鼓，抬了一口猪来慰劳部队，高呼“八路军最后胜利”！在禹门口东边的小村里，墙上已经写上了“欢迎体贴人民痛苦的八路军”的标语。禹门口的老百姓知道八路军到了，赶快派遣代表来与我干部接头，亲切的问军队需要什么，有什么困难。张永祥老汉说：“毛泽东的队伍是仁义之师，二十四年上曾到过这里，待老百姓可好哩，所以人人忘不了”！一个杂货铺掌柜说：“我们早就盼上你们了，你们不来，咱们再也活不下去了”！
