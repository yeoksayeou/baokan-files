[This dispatch from our newspaper in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan area, dated the 13th] Yanggu Fifth District, in conjunction with spring ploughing, is carrying out a re-examination, paying attention to resolving the spring famine problem. The district recently convened a meeting of over two thousand activists, summarizing the mass mobilization and arranging for the re-examination. During the summary, everyone unanimously agreed that feudal landlords had not been completely eliminated, and poor peasants had not completely overturned their situation. They should immediately launch a re-examination, and during the re-examination, pay attention to filling the grain needs according to the degree of poverty, in order to overcome the spring famine. After the meeting, the women's association of Xuezhai launched a competition, uncovering over 12,200 catties of grain hidden by landlords and over 1.5 million yuan worth of floating assets within two days. In addition to helping poor peasants overcome the spring famine, this could also buy thirty head of cattle, solving the difficulties of spring famine and spring ploughing. The peasants excitedly said: "Landlords have many bad tricks, but we have more people and more eyes." After Xuezhai's victory in investigating feudalism, the masses in Hulou Village immediately mobilized, forming investigation and transport teams, dividing the work precisely, and everyone participated. Within five days, they uncovered treasures such as yuanbao (silver ingots), dragon robes, jade cups, and luminous pearls from the old landlord of the Ming Dynasty, as well as over eighty bundles of goods. Yuanzhuang Village in Fucun discovered over a hundred bundles of goods and over four hundred pieces of clothing (worth over 870,000 yuan) in one day. Poor villages have also launched an upsurge in investigating feudalism, investigating the belongings of landlords from other villages scattered in their own villages. Xiaozhangzhuang, with twelve households, uncovered wheat and carts hidden by landlords from other villages. The 4th sub-district, with thirteen villages, uncovered seventy-four mu of land, four head of cattle, and three carts. Sixty-seven shi of wheat, sixty-four shi of coarse grains, one hundred and twenty-five catties of copper coins, and a batch of clothing. Currently, in addition to continuing the re-examination, the masses in various villages are actively purchasing livestock to carry out spring ploughing. In the thorough overthrowing of feudalism re-examination movement, the peasants' awareness of protecting the fields and joining the army has been further enhanced. Currently, the masses in nineteen villages are brewing plans to join the army. The director of the women's association of Xuezhai Village also guaranteed to send her husband to join the army.

[This dispatch from our newspaper in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan area, dated the 13th] The 5th District and 4th Sub-district of Zhuxian (Liaocheng) are using three methods – exchanging labor, communal feeding, and mutual assistance – to solve the difficulty of not having cattle for spring ploughing. First, households without cattle work for households with cattle, two days of work in exchange for one day of cattle ploughing. Second, cattle distributed during land reform or purchased separately are bought and fed communally by three or four households. Third, three or five households freely combine their labor to form mutual aid ploughing groups to jointly excavate and harrow the land. Since the implementation of the above three methods in most villages in the 4th sub-district, significant results have been seen.

    【本报冀鲁豫十三日电】阳谷五区结合春耕，开展复查，并注意结合解决春荒问题。该区于日前，特召集了两千余人的积极分子大会，总结大动并布置复查，总结中大家一致认为封建地主尚未彻底消灭，贫苦农民尚未彻底翻身，应即展开复查，并于复查中注意按贫苦程度不同填补粮食，以求渡过春荒。会后薛寨妇会展开竞赛，两天内查出地主隐蔽粮食一万二千二百多斤，及约值一百五十余万元的浮财。除能帮助贫苦农民渡春荒外，并能买三十个耕牛，春荒春耕困难，可获解决。农民都兴奋的说：地主的坏法子多，没有咱的人多眼多。薛寨查封建胜利后，胡楼村群众亦立即动员起来，组成调查、搬运等组，精密分工、人人动手，五天中即查出明朝老地主的元宝、龙衣、玉杯、夜明珠等珍宝和包袱八十多个。富村苑庄一天即查出包袱百余个，衣服四百余件（约值八十七万余元）。穷村也掀起查封建热潮，清查外村地主分散在本村的东西。十二户的小张庄，查出外村地主隐藏的麦子和大车。四小区大小十三个村即查出地七十四亩、牛四头、车三辆。麦子六十七石，粗粮六十四石，青钱一百廿五斤，及衣物一部。现各村群众除一面继续复查外，正纷纷购买牲口进行春耕中。在彻底翻身的复查运动中，农民保田参军的觉悟更形提高，现有十九个村群众正在酝酿参军。薛寨村妇会主任并保证送自己的丈夫参军。
    【本报冀鲁豫十三日电】筑先（聊城）五区四小区运用换工、伙喂、互助三个办法，解决春耕没牛困难。一、无牛户给有牛户做活，两天换牛耕地一天。二、土地改革中斗出和另买的牛，均由三家或四家伙买伙喂。三、三家或五家劳力自由结合成互助耕地小组，共同掘地、耙地。以上三个办法在四小区大部村庄施行以来，颇见成效。
