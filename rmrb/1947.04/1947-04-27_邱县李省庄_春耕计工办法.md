Spring Plowing Work Point Calculation Method
Jiang Dong, Jin Lu

Li Shengzhuang Village, Qiuxian County, studied the issue of work point calculation for this year's spring plowing. Based on past experience, it was decided to implement the piece-rate work system as follows:

(1) Wage Determination: One person working one day equals three *xiang* (a unit of time, roughly half a day), with one *xiang* being a small work unit of ten points. From spring plowing to before wheat harvest, each ten points earns three *jin* of grain (wheat harvest labor is more expensive, wages will be determined separately). A full day's work is thirty points, totaling nine *jin* of grain. Each person's work is temporarily recorded on a "work card," and accounts are settled with each other at certain intervals.

(2) Manure Hauling: Divided according to the distance of the land and the amount of work. One ox is equivalent to three people. Hauling one cart of manure requires two oxen and two people. For land half a *li* (a unit of distance, roughly 500 meters) from the village, hauling six carts per *xiang* is counted as eight small work units, totaling eighty points, with the two oxen earning sixty points and the two people earning twenty points. For each additional trip, thirteen points are added, with the two people getting four points and the two oxen getting nine points. For each trip less, thirteen points are deducted. For land one *li* from the village, hauling five trips earns the same points as above. For each additional trip, fifteen points are added, with the two people getting five points and the two oxen getting ten points. For land one and a half *li* from the village, hauling four trips earns the same points as above. For each additional trip, twenty points are added, with the two oxen getting fifteen points and the two people getting five points. For land two *li* from the village, hauling three trips earns the same points as above. For each additional trip, twenty-six points are added, with the two people getting six points and the two oxen getting twenty points (because the oxen exert more effort at greater distances, and people can ride back in the empty cart, the increase in points for people is smaller).

(3) Plowing: Divided into sandy soil and black soil. For sandy soil, plowing to a depth of five inches, three and a half *mu* (a unit of area, roughly 0.16 acres) per *xiang* by two oxen and one person, counts as seven small work units (ox six, person one). For each additional half *mu* plowed, one small work unit is added. The added work points are added to the oxen's work points, because fast oxen plow more land, and the person saves energy. For black soil, plowing to a depth of four inches, the work points are the same as for sandy soil. If plowing ridges, three *mu* is equivalent to seven small work units.

(4) Harrowing: Two oxen and one person harrow sixteen *mu* (double harrowing, counted as seven small work units, person one, oxen six).

(5) Sowing: Each group selects two skilled sowers. Sowing eight *mu* counts as seven and a half small work units, with one ox getting three small work units, and the two people helping with the seed drill getting two small work units. The two skilled sowers are responsible for holding the drill and spreading the seeds, and they can be replaced at any time, earning two and a half small work units.

(6) Weeding: Calculated based on the standard *mu*, depending on whether the land is easy or difficult to weed. For land with dense seedlings and many weeds, seven *fen* (a unit of area) is counted as one *mu*, counting as one small work unit. For land that is easy to weed, one *mu* is counted as one *mu*, counting as one small work unit. To prevent negative phenomena from easily occurring when calculating work points by *mu*, each group selects a household good at weeding as a standard person, using them as a model. The order of weeding should be arranged to facilitate inspection. If the weeding is not done well, full points will not be obtained.

This work point calculation method solves the following problems:

(1) Encourages and improves labor efficiency, solving the problem of skilled workers doing work faster and earning more points. It can maximize labor intensity and improve technology, preventing skilled people from being restricted by certain negative factors that existed in the past.

(2) The quality and distance of the land are specifically calculated according to different situations, and the work point calculation method is determined. In piece-rate work, there will be no deviations due to the distance and quality of the land, achieving a situation where neither party suffers a loss.

(3) Livestock work points are based on the piece rate as the standard. Good livestock can earn more points, and households with livestock will not suffer losses. At the same time, for livestock with weaker strength, due to the piece-rate work system, those with livestock and those using livestock will not suffer losses, and the issue of livestock work points will not affect the development and consolidation of mutual aid teams.

(4) Calculating points by the piece and converting points into work, and determining wages according to the season, with accounts settled after each season, is more reasonable. Determining wages for each season and having a short account settlement time will not affect everyone's emotions.

The shortcomings of this method are that it does not absorb women and children into spring plowing labor (they have separate methods for managing the work of men and women, but only for sewing, weaving, and doing household chores, women and men exchange labor), and they should be absorbed as much as possible to change past habits. In the current situation of labor shortage, women and children should be absorbed into spring production in large numbers. Secondly, no methods have been proposed for large-scale labor exchange between the front and rear lines of war and production, which should be added (they have separate spring plowing production plans, combined with large-scale development of sideline agriculture. However, no methods have been proposed for combining war participation and production in labor exchange and work point calculation). In addition, whether the regulations on wages and the standards for calculating work by the piece are too high or too low should be further studied based on the different conditions in various regions.

    春耕计工办法
    江东、晋鲁
    邱县李省庄研究了今年春耕计工问题，根据过去经验，确定实行按件计工办法如下：
    （一）工资确定：一天一人一工作三晌，以一晌为一个小工，每个小工作十分，由春耕到麦收前，每十分得工资谷三斤（麦收人工贵，工资另订）。一天一整工为三十分，共工资谷九斤，每人出的工，临时发给“工牌”到一定时期，互相算账。（二）拉粪：依地的远近，按活计分。一个牛顶三个人，拉一车粪用两个牛两个人。离村半里者，一晌拉六车，计八个小工，共八十分，两个牛得六十分。两个人二十分。如多拉一趟，即增加十三分，两个人分四分，两个牛分九分。如少拉一趟，扣十三分。离村一里者拉五趟，分数与上同，多拉一趟加十五分，两人分五分，两牛分十分。一里半者拉四趟，多拉一趟加二十分，两牛分十五分，两人分五分。二里者拉三趟，多拉一趟加二十六分，两人分六分，两牛分二十分（因地远牛费力气大，人可坐空车，故地远的人分数增加少）。（三）犁地：分沙地与黑土地两种，沙地犁五寸深，一晌犁三亩半，两牛一人，计七个小工（牛六人一），每多犁半亩，多计一个小工。多计的工分，加在牛工上，因快牛犁地多，而且人省劲。黑土地犁四寸深，工分与沙地同。如犁地带子，三亩顶七个小工。（四）耙地：两牛一人耙十六亩（对头耙，计七个小工，人一牛六）。（五）播种：每组选两个播种能手，播种八亩，计七个半小工，内一个牛得三个小工，帮楼拉磴子两人两个小工，扶楼与撒种由两个播种能手负责，随时可以替换，得两个半小工。（六）锄地：按地好锄与不好锄折合标准亩计算，苗稠草多的地，以七分作一亩，计一个小工。好锄的地，一亩作一亩，计一个小工。为防止按亩计工容易发生不好的现象，每组选出好锄家作标准人，以他作为样子，锄地时次序排好，以便检查，如锄得不好，就得不到足分。这一计工办法，解决了如下的几个问题：（１）奖励与提高劳动效能，解决了技术熟练的能手做活快，得分多。能够尽量发挥劳动强度，与改进提高技术，不致使技术好的人，为过去存在的某些消极因素而受到限制。（２）地的好坏远近，都根据了不同情况进行了具体计算，确定了计工办法。在按件计工中，不致因地的远近和好坏而有所偏差，达到双方互不吃亏。（３）牲口折工，依件为标准，好牲口能够多得分，有牲口的户不致吃亏。同时牲口力量较差的，由于按件计工，有牲口的与使用牲口的，大家也不吃亏，不会因牲口的折工问题影响到互助组的发展与巩固。（４）按件计分，按分折工，根据季节定工资，一个季节完了，算工还账，这是比较合理的。各个季节定各个季节的工资，还账时间短，不会影响大家情绪。这个办法的不足处，是没有吸收妇女儿童都参加到春耕劳动中去（他们另有男女管工办法，但只在缝衣织布做家庭活上妇女与男人变工），应该尽量吸收她们参加，改变过去的习惯。在现在劳动力缺乏的情况下，更应该大量吸收妇女儿童到春耕生产中来。其次是参战与生产的前后方大变工没有提出办法，这是应该加进去的（他们另有春耕生产计划，与大量发展副业农业结合。但未提参战与生产结合的变工计工办法）。另外，在工资的规定与做活按件计算的标准上，是否有过高或过低，还应该根据各地情况不同，加以研究。
