　　Linqing Zhuzhuang Cooperative
    Leads the Masses to Plant the Roots of Wealth
    [This newspaper, Jinan, 13th dispatch] The Linqing Zhuzhuang Cooperative has become a model for organizing the masses for emancipation and production. Active members of the village, Gao Yuerong, Dong Liankui, and others, organized the Minsheng Cooperative. Initially, they mobilized people to buy shares, mainly through personal relationships. There were fifty-one members, mostly reliable middle and poor peasants, with a total share capital of 34,250 yuan. During the organizational process, active members were discovered and cultivated from among the members, and all union members were connected to become cooperative members. Subsequently, the Farmers' Association and Women's Association were established, and the village government was re-elected. Dong Jiankui was elected as the new village head. During the settlement of accounts with the landlords, Cooperative Chairman Gao and Village Head Dong personally led the masses to speak out about their grievances. Before a portion of the fruits of the struggle were distributed, they were temporarily stored in the cooperative, with interest at two percent, replacing the masses in safekeeping. When the fruits were distributed, not a penny was wasted, and the masses were very satisfied. After the masses received their share of the fruits, 70 percent of the farmer association members bought shares in the cooperative. After the cooperative completed the task of mobilizing the masses, the Farmers' Association Chairman and militia captain were elected as standing committee members of the cooperative, and Village Head Dong was elected as the deputy chairman. Cooperative Chairman Gao also served as a Farmers' Association committee member. Currently, the cooperative is actively supporting the agricultural production of the emancipated masses and women's weaving. The cooperative has become a shining banner for the emancipated masses in Lin'nan to plant the roots of wealth. Cooperative Chairman Gao Yuerong is a poor peasant who actively serves the masses and does not want wages or bonuses. During the army recruitment movement, he withdrew 3,000 yuan from his dividends and allocated it to Shen Wangjing, the militia instructor who joined the army, under his name as a share. During the donation movement, he took out another 1,500 yuan. After the Lunar New Year, when the cooperative cadres were re-elected, he was warmly welcomed by all the members and was re-elected. The masses said, "Don't look at him being young, he has ideas, and his temperament is good."
