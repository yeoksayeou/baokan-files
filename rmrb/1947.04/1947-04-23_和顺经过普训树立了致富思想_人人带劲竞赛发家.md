    【Benbao Heshun Xun】After the Heshun County District and Village Production Mobilization Conference on March 10, each district held production mobilization conferences for village cadres, activists, labor heroes, and various production experts. Subsequently, small-scale farmer production training classes were universally conducted in the joint defense areas, specifically addressing various obstacles to production, such as fear of getting rich, middle peasants' fear of struggle, and the muddled thinking of taking pride in poverty and living off struggle. After resolving these issues, everyone became enthusiastic about production. Those who were inactive before have now started working from dawn till dusk, and even lazy people and those who were ambivalent have joined mutual aid groups. In the past half month, the following achievements have been made:
    First, in terms of spring plowing, according to statistics from seven villages in the Gaoqiu Joint Defense Area of the Second District over six days, a total of more than 165,000 jin of manure were delivered, 555 mu of land were plowed, more than 1,990 mu were planted with barley, 241 mu were planted with spring wheat, 71 mu were planted with millet, and 42 mu were planted with potatoes.
    Secondly, sideline occupations are also very energetic. In the six villages of Jingshang, Nanjuncheng, Mafang, Shuangyugou, and Fujiazhuang in the Sixth District, more than 8,600 jin of licorice roots were dug up in ten days or so, transported to Heshun city and sold for 150 yuan per jin, totaling more than 1.2 million yuan. Under the leadership of An Jinzhu, director of the military committee, Fujiazhuang dug 4,270 jin of licorice in ten days. In Songyan Village, Third District, the original plan was to increase the number of donkeys by 20 throughout the year. As a result of universal training, farmers were no longer afraid of getting rich. In half a month, the team of Li Zhongqiu alone increased the number of donkeys by 14 and one mule. In the past, women in the village mainly sold food and did not value spinning and weaving. After the chairman of the Women's Rescue Association took the lead as a model, all the women in the village turned to spinning and weaving. The five teams spun a total of 355 jin of cotton and wove 22 zhang of cloth. On April 1, Songgou Village in the Second District could not deliver manure due to strong winds. The whole village, young and old, took action completely, organizing 37 groups to launch a campaign to dig medicinal herbs in exchange for cotton. Under the leadership of political directors, village chiefs, and other cadres, they dug 2,763 jin of medicinal herbs in two days, selling them for more than 220,000 yuan. In addition, after breaking the fear of getting rich, they not only actively produced, but also did not waste money when they had it, and invested the money in cooperatives. For example, the Songyan Village Cooperative had original capital of 400,000 yuan. Due to the voluntary investment of the masses, it newly expanded by 300,000 yuan, and now has a total share capital of 700,000 yuan. In half a month, the profits helped the group buy 15 donkeys. After the production mobilization conference, the masses' thinking changed, and the idea of fearing getting rich was gradually overcome. Gao Tianbao, a newly emancipated farmer in Longwang Village, Fifth District, realized after attending the district production mobilization conference with his wife that it was equivalent to being poor if he didn't produce well after being emancipated. The two discussed it all night. Tianbao proposed that with seven mu of land, he would guarantee 60 dan of manure per mu this year, increase grain by one dou per mu in the autumn, participate in transportation, and buy half a donkey in the autumn, saving a pair of shoes (wearing only three pairs); the woman guaranteed to help 45 workdays throughout the year, spin two jin of thread, and the three family members would not buy cloth, and all the winter and summer linings would be new, raise a fat pig, and buy half a donkey. And challenge each other, whoever does not complete it will not get a new lining for their winter cotton clothes. Yang Tiande, an old middle peasant in Nanjuncheng, Sixth District, did not understand his thinking in the past and was afraid of struggle every day. He even scolded his wife for spinning. After this universal training, he didn't scold at all, and even weighed five jin of cotton and told his wife to work harder. In the past, he made excuses that there was nothing to eat and no place to pen it when he was asked to raise pigs. Now he first booked a pig from the chairman of the Farmers' Association. In the past, when cadres led the digging of licorice, he slept outside all day and only dug four liang. Now he digs five jin a day, and the next day he dug 20 jin. Lazy men Ma Gaosheng and Xu Jia'er in Mafang Village used to never work. After the production mobilization conference, they returned to the village and made self-criticisms, saying: "I used to be like buckwheat stubble, not fertilizing, and raising children without wanting to work. Now I'm like soybean stubble, fertilizing and the wife earns money and saves labor, and the children pick up manure. So I realized this time that labor is for my own enrichment." He immediately joined a mutual aid group, and everyone elected him as the leader of the mutual aid group. Now he is working very hard. Yao Shuancheng, a poor farmer in Dayangpo, Sixth District, was only emancipated after the land reform. He was given a large and a small cow, but he was too lazy to even feed the animals because he wanted to eat from the big pot and was afraid of struggle if he was treated well, so he didn't dare to work and get rich. After the universal training, he wove mats at home to exchange for piglets and also challenged others. Wang Baofu, a middle peasant in Gaoqiu Village, bought a donkey with others after his thinking was cleared through universal training. Jiao Sanhai, who used to be afraid of struggle and pretended to be sick for a year, was immediately cured after his thinking was cleared through universal training and prepared for production.

    和顺经过普训树立了致富思想
    人人带劲竞赛发家
    【本报和顺讯】三月十日和顺县区村生产动员大会后，各区又以区召开了村干部和积极分子、劳动英雄、各种生产能手的生产动员大会，接着又在联防普遍进行了农民生产小型训练班，专门解决生产中的各种障碍问题，如怕发财，中农怕斗争，还有的以穷为荣吃斗争饭等各种糊涂思想。经过这一解决后，大家的生产起了劲，在以前不动的，现已起早搭黑动开了，懒汉与阴阳等也都参加了互助组。在这半月的时间内已获以下成绩：
    首先在春耕方面，根据二区高邱联防七个村六天统计，共送粪十六万五千多斤，耕地五百五十五亩，种大麦一千九百九十多亩，种春麦二百四十一亩，种谷七十一亩，种山药蛋四十二亩。
    其次副业方面也十分起劲。六区京上、南军城、马坊、双鱼沟、富家庄等六个村，在十来天内，就刨了甘草根八千六百余斤，运往和顺城每斤卖洋一百五十元，共卖洋一百二十余万元。富家庄在武委主任安金柱的领导下，十天内刨了甘草四千二百七十斤。三区松烟村，原定计划全年增加毛驴二十头，结果普训后农民都不怕发财了，半月仅栗仲秋队增加了毛驴十四头，骡一头。该村妇女们过去是卖饭为主，不重纺织，经过妇救主席首先起模范，全村妇女都转向纺织，五个队共纺花三百五十五斤，织布二十二丈。二区松沟村，四月一日因大风不能送粪，全村老少完全动手，共组织了三十七个组，展开了刨药材换棉花的运动，在政治主任村长等干部的领导下，两天共刨了药材二千七百六十三斤，卖洋廿二万余元。此外，打破怕富思想后，不仅积极生产，而且有了钱也不浪费，把钱投入合作社，如松烟村合作社，原有资金四十万元，因群众自动入股，新扩大三十万元，现在共有股金七十万元。在半月内得利帮助组内买了毛驴十五头。生产动员大会后，群众思想上起了变化，怕发家的想法被逐渐克服了。五区龙旺村新翻身农民高天保夫妇参加区生产动员会后，认识到翻了身不好好生产还等于穷，两口回去商讨了一夜，天保提出有了七亩地，今年要保证每亩上六十担粪，到秋后每亩增粮一斗，参加运输，到秋天要买半头毛驴，节约一双鞋（只穿三双）；女人保证全年帮助四十五个工，纺线二斤，三口人不买布穿，冬夏里表全变新，喂一口肥猪，买半个毛驴。并互相挑战，谁完不成冬天棉衣不给新里面。六区南军城老中农杨天德，在过去思想没有闹通，每天怕斗争，老婆纺花他还骂。这次普训后，一只不骂了，还称了五斤花，让老婆加油干。过去让喂猪，他借口说没吃的没地方圈，现在他先向农会主席定买了一口猪。过去干部领导刨甘草，他到外边整睡一天，只刨四两，现在一天刨五斤，到第二天刨了二十斤。马坊村懒汉麻高升、徐假儿，过去一贯不劳动，经过生产动员大会，回村自作检讨说：“我过去好比荞麦茬，不上粪，养下儿不待劳动。现在好比小豆茬，上上粪老婆打省汉来赚，养下娃娃拾了粪。所以我这次认识了劳动是为了自己致富的。”他马上参加了互助组，大家选他为互助组组长，现在干的劲头很大。六区大阳坡贫农姚拴成，土地改革才翻了身，给他分了大小牛各一头，但懒的连牲口都不喂，原因是想吃大锅饭，受的好了怕斗争，因此不敢劳动发家。经过普训后，在家编席字，换小猪，还和别人挑战。高邱村中农王保富，经普训打通了思想后，回去和别人伙买了毛驴。焦三孩，以前怕斗争，装病一年，普训后打通了思想，病马上就好了，准备生产。（启明、樊荣）
