Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st. 民营报纸Private newspapers in major cities in the Chiang Kai-shek controlled areas have been forced to reduce their size or cease publication because Chiang Kai-shek encouraged paper merchants to manipulate the market and restrict newspaper imports. According to recent news from Shanghai: Da Lu Evening News, Social Daily, and Pingfan News Agency, published in Tianjin; and Da Zhong Bao Dao Bao, published in Hankou, have all been forced to cease publication due to economic difficulties; while Peiping Ta Kung Pao, Tianjin Yi Shi Bao, and Northern Daily have reduced their size. It is widely believed that this is another poisonous trick by Chiang Kai-shek to strangle freedom of speech.

　　蒋介石用卑鄙办法
    绞杀言论自由
    【新华社陕北一日电】蒋管区各大城市民营报纸因蒋介石鼓励纸商操纵市场，限制报纸进口，已纷纷被迫减缩篇幅，或无法维持而停刊。据最近上海消息：天津出版之大路晚报、社会日报、平凡通讯社；汉口出版之大中报导报等均因经济困难而被迫停刊；北平大公报、天津益世报、北方日报等则已减缩篇幅。众信此为蒋介石绞杀言论自由之又一毒计。
