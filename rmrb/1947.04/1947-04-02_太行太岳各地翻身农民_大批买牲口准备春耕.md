　　Liberated Farmers in Taihang and Taiyue Areas
    Buy Livestock in Large Numbers to Prepare for Spring Plowing
    [Report from this newspaper] In areas like Lucheng, Licheng, and Huguan, liberated masses are buying livestock in large numbers in preparation for spring plowing. The masses in Shangyao Village, Licheng, used 1.8 million yuan from their gains after liberation to send people to Xingtai to buy back 18 heads of livestock. Adding the two they bought a few days ago, they have newly acquired 20 heads of livestock. The masses in Licun Village, Lucheng, said, "We are liberated! Our hearts are also liberated! Now that we have capital, we must engage in production properly." The village has 54 heads of livestock. By engaging in sideline transportation for a month, they earned more than 2.03 million yuan. They used the money they earned to buy eight large mules and four donkeys. They are now preparing to buy six more animals. The village recently formulated a plan for sideline production for the first half of spring plowing, aiming to earn 1.5 million yuan, which will allow them to buy six more livestock. Liberation hero Liang Madou confidently said, "When it's time for plowing, we must exceed the number of livestock before the War of Resistance (65 heads)." The liberated masses in Dongguanbi, Huguan, organized themselves to buy livestock to solve the shortage of animal power. Under the leadership of liberation hero Huangfu Laichang, they have already bought 38 mules, donkeys, and cattle, and plan to buy more than ten more before spring plowing. To leverage collective strength, they have established methods for shared buying, shared feeding, and shared use: 1. Shared feeding: A good livestock feeder is selected from the shared feeders. Everyone is responsible for the fodder, and the manure belongs to the feeder. If the feeding is done well, the feeder will be awarded three livestock workdays per month. 2. Shared buying: Individuals voluntarily find three to five households to jointly buy livestock. 3. Shared use: The amount of work is determined by the size of the share, and livestock work tickets are issued. A small calculation is made every ten days, and accounts are settled monthly. Excess livestock workdays are compensated with two human workdays for one livestock workday. During plowing, the feeder will uniformly operate the plow. The usage time and amount of plowing are uniformly regulated according to the distance and size of the field to maintain the health of the livestock. Landlords will compensate the plow operator with labor for operating the plow.
    [Report from this newspaper, Taiyue, 31st] Liberated farmers in sixteen villages in Jincheng, Gaoping, Tunliu, and Wangwu counties have found ways to purchase livestock to solve the difficulties of spring plowing, and have achieved significant results, purchasing a total of 161 heads of draught animals. Some villages have developed the mistaken idea of "four fears" regarding the purchase of draught animals, such as fearing being assigned corvée labor, fearing having to plow and sow for military families first, fearing that others will use them but not provide fodder, and fearing being labeled as rich. In Wumen Village, Jincheng, due to this ideological obstacle, there were only eight livestock for 1,000 mu of land, with an average of one livestock for thirteen households. The whole village still uses forced plowing to overcome the difficulties and is unwilling to buy livestock. After solving the ideological problems, the cadres in Hexi, Shimmo, Xianlin, and other sixteen villages came up with five ways to solve the problem of the masses lacking money to buy livestock: First, Huangdong Village in Wangwu solved the lack of livestock by developing sideline occupations. Yang Jinsong alone sold seven pigs, large and small, and bought back three draught cattle. This year's production plan for the village includes an additional 800 pigs, so that no household lacks cattle. Second, Donglin and Henan villages in Tunliu organized 149 women to weave with 200,000 yuan in loans. In half a month, they wove 320 zhang of cloth, sold foreign cloth for 640,000 yuan, and bought thirteen cattle. Third, the West Street Cooperative in Tunliu borrowed 600,000 yuan from the bank, purchased twelve cattle and one donkey, and sold them to the masses at cost. Fourth, in Shiwei Village, Gaoping, 5,000 jin of iron bells, iron statues, and scrap iron from the village temple were transported to an iron factory, receiving 120,000 yuan and buying three cattle. Fifth, several villages, including Dayang, Liujiazhuang, and Nanshe in Jincheng, distributed 62 heads of livestock from the fruits of victory that remained undistributed in the village commune cooperative to the farmers, some of which were sold to the farmers, using this money to buy back 23 draught cattle and distribute them to households with fewer cattle.

　　太行太岳各地翻身农民
    大批买牲口准备春耕
    【本报讯】潞城、黎城、壶关等地翻身群众，准备春耕大批买牲口。黎城上遥村群众，用翻身果实一百八十万元，派人到邢台买回牲口十八头，连前几天买的两头已新添牲口二十头。潞城李村沟群众说：“翻身啦！心也翻啦！有了本钱，可得好好闹生产。”全村牲口五十四头，搞副业运输一个月赚了二百零三万余元，用赚下的钱买下八条大骡子、四个驴，现还准备买六个牲口。该村最近又订出春耕前半个月副业生产计划，要赚一百五十万元，还能再买六头牲口。翻身英雄梁马斗有信心的说：“到犁地时，一定要超过抗战前的牲口数（六十五头）”。壶关东关壁翻身群众，组织起来买牲口，解决畜力困难。在翻身英雄皇甫来长带头下，已买到骡、驴、牛三十八头，计划春耕前还买十多头。为了发挥集体力量，订出伙买、伙喂、伙使用办法：一、伙喂，从伙喂中选出一个喂牲口的好把式，草料大家负责，粪归喂牲口者。喂好了，一个月奖喂者三个牲口工。二、伙买，自愿找三、五户对象，合力买牲口。三、伙使，按股大小决定用工多少，订出畜力工票，十天一小计，一月一算账。多用之牲口工，以二人力工还一畜力工。犁地时由喂牲口人统一掌犁，用的时间和犁地多少，按地远近大小块统一规定，以保持牲口健康，地主以人工还掌犁者工。
    【本报太岳卅一日电】晋城、高平、屯留、王屋等县十六个村的翻身农民设法购买牲口，解决春耕困难，已获得显著成绩，共购入耕畜一百六十一头。某些村对于购买耕畜产生了“四怕”的错误思想，如买牲口怕支差，怕为军属先犁种，怕别人用不给草料，怕说富。在晋城五门村由于这种思想障碍，一千亩土地才有八个牲口，平均十三户有一个牲口，全村还是用强犁克服困难，不愿意买牲口。和村、石末、鲜林等十六个村在思想问题解决后，干部想出五种解决群众缺钱购买牲口的办法：第一、王屋黄栋村以发展副业解决牲口缺乏，只杨金松卖出大小猪七口，买回耕牛三头。该村今年生产计划中增加八百个猪，做到家家不缺牛。第二、屯留东林、河南两村把二十万贷款组织一百四十九个妇女纺织，半月织布三百二十丈，卖洋六十四万元，买牛十三头。第三、屯留西街合作社向银行贷款六十万元，贩回牛十二头、驴一头，照本让给群众。第四、高平石未村是把村中寺庙中铁钟铁像和碎铁五千斤运至铁工厂，得到十二万元，买牛三头。第五、晋城大阳、刘家庄、南社等数村把留在村公所合作社未分配的果实牲口六十二头分给农民，其中部分出卖给农民，用此款来买回耕牛二十三头，分给少牛农户。
