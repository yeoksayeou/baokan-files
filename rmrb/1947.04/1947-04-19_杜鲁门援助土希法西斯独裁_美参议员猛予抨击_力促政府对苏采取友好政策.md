Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 15th: TASS, Washington dispatch: During the U.S. Senate's debate on the Truman aid bill for Greece and Turkey on the 10th and 11th, senators rose in opposition. Democratic Senators Pepper, Johnson, and Taylor spoke in succession, fiercely criticizing it. Pepper suggested submitting the Greek and Turkish issues to the United Nations and urged the U.S. to seek a better understanding with the Soviet Union. Pepper stated: We should resolve disputes in accordance with the principles of justice and fairness, including the issues of the Dardanelles Strait and equal opportunities for oil extraction in the Middle East. Pepper pointed out: After the Soviet Union's enormous sacrifices in this war, it strongly desires peace. The current proposal to aid Turkey is not due to any new Soviet threat, but because Britain no longer pays Turkey to maintain its army. The American people will rise up in opposition to the legislation of the Greek-Turkish aid bill. He said: "Guns, bayonets, and even atomic bombs cannot stop the development of this trend. The American people have awakened and seen hope. Only through the United Nations can a lasting democratic situation be truly established in the world." Pepper warned that adopting Truman's suggestion would clearly push the United States onto the path of empire. If the United States attempts to become an empire, it will certainly not be more successful than all those past attempts. Colorado Democratic Senator Johnson opposed aiding Turkey, stating that while the American people endured heavy taxes, bloodshed, and material losses during the war, Turkey colluded with Germany and Japan for speculation and profiteering. Johnson also condemned Truman's suggestion to transfer German military equipment to Turkey, saying: To provide military aid to the Turkish government is to aid fascist military dictatorship. Idaho Democratic Senator Taylor sternly opposed interfering in the internal affairs of Greece and Turkey, stating that Truman's plan constitutes a unilateral action in the Balkans. Taylor mocked the Army Department and the State Department's arbitrary propaganda that the Greek guerrillas, under foreign control, could overthrow the fascist leader Paul, who has an army of 120,000 and is aided by 10,000 British troops. Taylor pointed out that the United States intends to supply the Greek rulers with American weapons to slaughter the guerrillas without waiting for the report of the Security Council's investigation team in Greece. Taylor denounced the American plan to encourage reactionary forces all over the world, saying that this kind of plan is immoral.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th: TASS, New York, 14th: Colorado Democratic Senator Johnson and Ohio Republican Congressman Lude recently made radio commentaries to the nation on Truman's proposal to aid Turkey and Greece. Lude declared that Truman's suggestion would bankrupt the United States. He said: Truman suggested sending taxpayers' money to every warmonger and warlord who claims to be threatened by the Communists. Truman suggested interfering in the internal affairs of every country in the world, intending to divide the world into two armed blocs. Truman's suggestion undermines the United Nations organization. Johnson said: Aid to Turkey would promote a military alliance, which would shock the Soviet Union, just as the United States would be shocked if the Soviet Union concluded a military alliance with a neighboring country of the United States.

　　杜鲁门援助土希法西斯独裁
    美参议员猛予抨击
    力促政府对苏采取友好政策
    【新华社陕北十五日电】塔斯社华府讯：美参院于十、十一两日辩论杜鲁门援助希、土法案时，参议员群起反对。民主党参议员泼贝尔、强生及泰勒三氏相继演说，予以猛烈抨击。泼氏建议将希、土问题提交联合国，并力促美对苏谋取更好的谅解。泼氏称：吾人应遵照正义公平的原则解决争端，其中包括达达尼尔海峡与中东采油平等机会的问题。泼氏指出：苏联在这次大战的巨大牺牲以后，强烈要求和平，现在这个援助土耳其的提议，并非由于任何新的苏维埃威胁引起的，而是因为英国不再付给土耳其维持陆军的费用。美国人民将群起反对援助希土法案的立法。他说：“用枪炮刺刀甚至原子弹也阻止不了这个潮流的发展，美国人民已经觉醒而看见了希望，只有通过联合国才能真正在世界上建立起延续民主的局面”。泼氏警告称：如采用杜鲁门的建议，将明显地把美国推上帝国的道路，美国如企图成为帝国，决不会比过去所有的那些企图更成功些。科罗拉多州民主党参议员强生反对援助土耳其称：正当美国人民在战时忍受重税流血物财时，土耳其却与德日勾结投机牟利。强氏并斥责杜鲁门要求迁移德国军事设备到土耳其的建议，他说：以军事援助土耳其政府，即是援助法西斯主义的军事独裁。爱达荷州民主党参议员泰勒严正反对干涉希、土内政称：杜鲁门计划构成对巴尔干的片面行动。麦氏嘲笑陆军部及国务院所发出的关于希腊游击队在外国支配下，能够推翻拥有十二万军队，且有一万英军援助的法西斯头子保罗的武断宣传。麦氏指出：美国企图不等待安理会希腊调查团之报告，就以美国武器供给希腊统治者屠杀游击队。泰氏指斥美国计划在世界各地皆鼓励反动势力，他说这种计划是不道德的。
    【新华社陕北十六日电】塔斯社纽约十四日电：科罗拉多州民主党参议员强生及俄亥俄州共和党众议员卢德，顷就杜鲁门援助土、希建议，向全国作广播评论。卢德宣称：杜鲁门之建议，将使美国破产。他说：杜鲁门建议把纳税者的钱送给每一个战争魔王和军阀，而他们却声言受到共产党威胁，杜鲁门建议全世界上干涉每一国家的内政，意图使世界分裂为两个武装集团。杜鲁门的建议破坏了联合国组织。强生说：对土耳其的援助，将促进军事联盟，苏联将因此震惊，一若苏联如与美国邻邦缔结军事联盟时，美国将震惊一样。
