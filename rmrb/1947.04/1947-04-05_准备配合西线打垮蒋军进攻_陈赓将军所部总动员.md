　　In preparation to coordinate with the Western Front to defeat Chiang Kai-shek's attacks,
    General Chen Geng's troops mobilize
    [Reported from Taiyue on the 2nd] Enraged by Chiang Kai-shek's occupation of Yan'an, all corps under General Chen Geng held cadre meetings, party member meetings, and soldier meetings to conduct general mobilization, preparing to coordinate with the Western Front to defeat Chiang Kai-shek's offensive. At a cadre meeting of a certain unit, Political Commissar Zhang called on the entire army to mobilize and eliminate Chiang Kai-shek's troops; thousands of people unanimously demanded immediate action. Comrade Han Tingwu said, "Even if we have only one bullet left, we must complete the glorious task of eliminating Chiang's army and defending Chairman Mao!" Combat hero Hou Huaibao demanded immediate deployment to the front line. He said, "If we don't have livestock, three of us will carry a cannon!" On the spot, the soldiers enthusiastically drafted plans to annihilate the enemy, proposing competitions. Yan Guangchun proposed a competition with the First Company, with the condition that in three attacks, they would wipe out an enemy battalion, achieving large captures and small casualties. The First Company responded loudly, "Good! We agree!" Everyone and every company was swept up in the competition craze. At a soldiers' meeting of the Second Company, soldier Kong Qingyun said, "Even if the flesh on my body is beaten to a pulp, as long as my bones are not broken, I will not leave the front line!" Liberated soldier Li Wanqing originally planned to capture one prisoner and seize one gun, but now he tripled his plan. New soldier Jia Shihai said, "I have never fought a battle, but this time to defend Chairman Mao, I will also capture an enemy and seize a gun." At the Second Company's soldiers' meeting, a large number of soldiers donated their savings, totaling 8,250 yuan in Hebei-Chahar-Rehe-Liaoning currency, 19,000 yuan in Chiang currency, 22 pairs of shoes, socks, shirts, trousers, etc., to support the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia front.

    陈赓将军所部总动员
    【本报太岳二日电】陈赓将军所部为蒋介石侵占延安所激怒，各兵团纷纷召开干部大会、党员大会、军人大会，进行总动员，准备配合西线打垮蒋介石的进攻。某部干部大会上，张政委号召全军动员起来，消灭蒋介石部队；千百人一致要求立即出动。韩廷武同志说：“就是剩下一枪一弹，也要完成消灭蒋军、保卫毛主席的光荣任务！”战斗英雄侯怀保要求立即开上火线。他说：“没有牲口，我们三个人扛一门炮！”当场健儿们热烈的订歼敌计划，提出竞赛。延光春提出和一中队比赛，条件是三次出击，消灭敌人一个营，做到缴获大、伤亡小。一中队响亮回答说：“好！我们同意！”每个人、每个连队都卷入竞赛热潮。二连的军人大会上，战士孔庆云说：“即使我身上的肉打烂了只要不打断骨头，就不下火线！”解放战士李万青原来计划捉一个俘虏、缴一支枪，这时把计划增加了三倍。新战士贾士孩说：“我没有打过仗，这回保卫毛主席，我也要捉一个敌人，缴一支枪。”二连军人大会上，有大批战士捐出自己的积蓄冀洋八千二百五十元，蒋币一万九千元，鞋二十二双、袜子、衬衣、裤子等，支援陕甘宁前线。
