　　Implement Class Education Mass Line
    Shouyang Independent Battalion's Combat Effectiveness Greatly Increased
    [Our newspaper Taihang News] The Shouyang Independent Battalion has greatly improved its class consciousness after two rounds of universal reflection and grievance sessions. In October of last year, the Yan clique organized local landlord armed forces to carry out plunder and settling of old scores, which caused unease among some personnel, who complained that they had turned over too early, and individual desertions occurred. The battalion's leading comrades grasped the characteristic of the local troops having a close blood ties with the masses, and political commissar Jia from the county reported the facts of the peasants' accusations of the landlords' oppression during the turning-over and grievance sessions, and mobilized the soldiers to pour out their grievances. After the soldiers poured out their grievances, the leadership summarized them into three issues, and asked the soldiers to discuss them again to resolve the questions of whether the turning-over was justified, whether it was excessive, and whether it was premature. At the same time, local examples were collected, and participation in the mass struggle in the resident villages was organized to educate the soldiers with reality, raising them from hating a certain landlord in their village to hating Huo Jihan, the most reactionary landlord armed force leader in the whole county, and even Yan Xishan and Chiang Kai-shek. The soldiers' political consciousness was significantly improved, so they created an outstanding combat example of zero casualties versus seventy enemy casualties on November 30th of last year upon their first deployment. On January 6th of this year, the Yan puppet troops suddenly used five thousand troops to "flood" the entire Shouyang area, eighty-six soldiers' families were subjected to settling of old scores, twenty-seven soldiers' family members were brutally murdered, and some soldiers were forced to return home to mobilize the soldiers. The troops' morale once again fell into serious unease. The battalion once again stabilized and greatly improved the troops' combat morale by means of grievance and revenge. The day after the enemy largely withdrew, the Independent Battalion launched a three-day political offensive, with the troops touring the villages on the periphery, publicizing and demonstrating to crush the enemy's rumors that "the Independent Battalion has been wiped out" and to comfort the soldiers' families. At the same time, they consciously made the soldiers witness the enemy's atrocities to arouse hatred. After returning, a revenge and grievance movement was launched. First, the ideological problems of the cadres were cleared up, specific methods were discussed, and cadres from the battalion headquarters went to each company to ignite the fire, recognizing what the Eighth Route Army and the Communist Party had given us, what the enemy landlords' revenge team had given us, who the world belonged to, and whether we were avenging or compromising when our parents, wives, brothers, sisters were killed, and our belongings were robbed. Were we to be traitors or heroes? Then a meeting of activists was convened to launch the grievance sessions. When Yue Shuanfu from the First Company reflected, more than twenty activists cried out in unison, forgetting to eat. Then, grievance sessions were held in groups in each company. Wang Zhenchun said: His father pulled camels, his mother begged for food, and he himself herded sheep from childhood, running barefoot in the snow in winter, his bare feet rubbing bloody; when he grew up, he worked as a hired laborer, and during the turning-over, he was given some houses, land, and livestock, and in less than half a year, he became a middle peasant. This time, even his own meager belongings were all looted, his mother was beaten half to death, his brother was arrested, and when he returned home during the political offensive, his mother cried loudly, telling him to work hard and never come back. He felt extremely sad and couldn't continue speaking several times because of crying. Wang Chengyu couldn't speak when he opened his mouth, he cried, when he was a child, his father was forced to death because of debt, his mother fled to Shanxi and remarried a shepherd, who still couldn't support him, and sold him to Wang ×, the head of the "Huangtiandao" in Shouyang, as a son for three years worse than a dog, getting up before dawn to clean up the old man's torn shoes and pour out the chamber pot, planting beans in the field, saying that if he didn't do well, a shovel would split his leg, and once arguing with the old man's nanny, the old man threw a shovel over, almost hitting his head. When Cui Yinshun returned home during the political offensive, he saw his mother lying on the kang, beaten black and blue, and the livestock had also been taken away, and he gritted his teeth in anger. On the fourth day, a full battalion meeting was held, and after several typical grievances, the soldiers were anxious and said: "Let's fight, just having meetings is not enough!" Zhang Guozhen said: "I am this person, this gun, I must fight back ten people!" The masses' determination for revenge increased unprecedentedly, and the pessimistic and uneasy psychology was swept away. The troops immediately appeared young and energetic. In the final summary, the formal proposal was to avenge and perform meritorious service, establish a committee, establish a merit book, and each person made a plan for meritorious service. The day after the meeting, a victory was won, annihilating a platoon of the 49th Division that had occupied Puyang. On the 21st, in the Zhang Han ambush, facing an enemy twice as strong, more than twenty enemies were killed or wounded. Zhang Zhengui, who had sores on his legs and had difficulty walking, rushed to the front in the fish water battle, captured a Type 38 rifle, and rushed forward again without bothering to untie the prisoner's ammunition bag and handed it to someone else. Xue Guixiao used to be afraid of death, and also captured a gun, he said: "I used to be timid, but since the revenge and meritorious service movement, I don't know why I've become so brave, and I don't know where this energy comes from!" Thirteen backward elements in the entire battalion became recognized activists. On March 7th, in the raid on Dagao Village, after marching more than one hundred miles, Huo Jihan, the head of the reactionary landlord armed forces in the whole county and the commander of the Shouyang Revenge Team, and the traitor Wang Sanquan, were captured alive, eliminating a great harm for the masses. When Huo was captured, the entire battalion cheered and applauded, and one soldier pointed at Huo and asked: "Didn't you rob my home?" He slapped Huo in the face happily. The troops marched and fought for two days and two nights without any fatigue, and were already brewing new plans on the way back, the soldiers said: "Now we know why we are fighting, we have identified the target!"
    Another important factor in improving the quality of work in the Shouyang troops is the initial implementation of the mass line. Before each battle, platoon or squad leaders and above are always convened to discuss the combat plan, encouraging everyone to think of solutions and promote everyone's creativity. The Chedaoling ambush was designed by the platoon leader to lure the enemy out with the militia. In battle, squad and platoon leaders, branch committee members, party members, heroes, etc. can automatically propose slogans to encourage and promote heroic spirit and maintain battlefield discipline. In the work of consolidating new soldiers, on the one hand, local cadres and activists among the new soldiers are encouraged and appropriately placed, allowing them to serve as deputy squad leaders and give play to their enthusiasm; on the other hand, veteran soldiers are mobilized to carry out universal care, giving up warm kangs and cotton quilts, and lying on dry grass with cotton clothes on. More than sixty new soldiers did not have a single desertion. Combining the promotion of cadres with the election of models has also achieved good results. Last winter, five platoon deputies and one platoon leader were promoted, and all became heroes by the end of the year, deeply winning the support of the masses. The ideological education is also carried out using the mass line, first starting from the actual thoughts of the soldiers, exposing problems, and then summarizing them and handing them over to the soldiers themselves to discuss and solve. Cultivating activists to take the lead and guiding the soldiers to express their opinions, especially in the First Company, which has done a good job in this revenge and meritorious service, the soldiers themselves made personal plans and then helped the leading cadres make plans, requiring the deputy captain to do a good job in life, teach everyone military techniques, and the deputy political commissar to pay attention to his temper, read more newspapers, attend political classes, and pay attention to the overall situation when solving problems. The deputy captain and deputy political commissar accepted these opinions with smiles, and signed and sealed them in writing and passed them on to each class, guaranteeing to do it, truly achieving close integration between the leadership and the masses, so that the meritorious service campaign truly becomes a mass movement.

　　贯彻阶级教育群众路线
    寿阳独立营战斗力大增
    【本报太行讯】寿阳独立营经过两次普遍反省诉苦，部队阶级觉悟大大提高。去年十月，阎顽组织地主武装，实行掠夺倒算，曾引起部分人员不安，埋怨翻身太早，并曾发生个别逃跑现象。该营领导同志掌握了地方部队与群众具有血肉联结的特点，由县上贾政委报告翻身诉苦中农民申诉地主的压迫事实，发动战士倒苦水，战士把苦水倒出后，领导上综合为三个问题，让战士再去讨论，解决了翻身应不应该，过火与过早等问题。同时收集当地实例，及参加驻村群众斗争，以现实教育战士，从痛恨本村某个地主，提高到痛恨全县最反动的地主武装头子霍继汉，以至阎锡山、蒋介石。战士政治觉悟显著提高，故去年十一月三十日，一出发便创造了零比七十的出色战例。今年一月六日，阎伪突以五千之众“水漫”寿阳全境，八十六户战士家庭被倒算，二十七个战士家属遭受残酷杀害，并有被迫来队活动战士回家的，部队情绪重又堕入严重不安。该营再一次以诉苦复仇方式，安定与大大提高了部队战斗情绪。在敌人大部撤退的第二天，独立营即发动了三天的政治攻势，部队周游边沿各村，一面宣传示威，粉碎敌人说“独立营已被消灭”的谣言，安慰战士家属；一面有意识的使战士眼见敌人暴行，激发仇恨心理。回来后，即开展复仇诉苦运动，首先打通干部思想问题，讨论具体办法，由营部干部分别到各连点火，认清八路军共产党给了我们什么？敌人老财复仇队给了我们什么？天下是谁的，父母妻子兄弟姐妹被害、东西被抢，我们手执武器是报仇还是妥协？是当叛徒还是当功臣？继即召开积极分子会，发动诉苦。一连岳拴富反省时，二十多个积极分子同声痛哭，忘了吃饭。接着就召开各连分组诉苦。王振春说：他父亲拉骆驼、母亲讨饭，他自己从小放羊，冬天赤脚在雪地里跑，光脚磨得血淋淋的；大了当长工，翻身中分了些房地牲口，不到半年变成中农。这回连自己一点穷家当，也全被倒算抢光，母亲打个半死，哥哥抓走，政攻中回家一看，母亲大哭，叫他好好干，千万不要回来。他心里难过极了，几次哭的说不下去。王成玉同志未曾开口就哭的不能说，他小时父亲因欠债逼死，母亲逃到山西改嫁一个放羊的，仍养不活，把他卖给寿阳“黄天道”头子王×当了三年儿子不如一只狗，天不明起来给老头搞的破鞋倒尿盆，在地里种豆，说是不好好干，一铁锹劈在腿上，又一次同老汉奶子吵嘴，老汉一铁锹扔过来，几乎插住脑袋。崔印顺政攻中回家，见母亲躺在炕上，打得浑身青黑，牲口也被拉走，气得咬牙切齿。第四天进行全营大会，几个典型诉苦后，战士们急得说：“打吧，光开会不沾！”张国祯说：“我就是这个人，这枝枪，非拚它十个人回来不行！”群众的复仇决心，空前增涨，悲观不安心理一扫而光，部队立即现得年轻有生气。最后总结中正式提出报仇立功，成立委员会，建立功劳簿，各人订了立功计划。大会第二天，就打了个胜仗，歼灭进占普烟之四十九师一个排。二十一日，张韩伏击战，对付敌一倍的兵力，又毙伤敌二十余。张贞贵，腿上生疮，走路困难，鱼水战斗中，冲在最前头，缴了一支三八式，不顾解俘虏子弹袋，交给别人就又向前冲。薛贵小过去怕死，也缴了一支枪，他说：“从前胆子小，复仇立功运动以来，不知怎的胆就大了，也不知这股劲是那里来的！”全营十三个落后分子变成了公认的积极分子。三月七日，奔袭大垴村，行军一百余里，活捉全县反动地主武装头子寿阳复仇队总队长霍继汉，叛徒王三全，更为群众除了大害。当霍被捉住时，全营欢跃鼓掌，有一个战士指着霍问：“不是你抢了我的家”？痛快的就打了霍一耳光。部队两天两晚行军打仗，毫无倦容，回来路上就又酝酿新的计划，战士们说：“现在知道为什么打仗，认清目标啦！”
    寿阳部队工作质量提高的另一重要因素，是群众路线的初步实行。每次战斗前，总是召集排或班以上干部讨论作战计划，推动大家想办法，发扬了大家的创造性。车道岭诱伏，就是排长设计叫民兵引诱敌人出来的。在战斗中，班排长、支委、党员、英雄等都能自动提出鼓动口号，发扬英勇精神，维持战场纪律。在巩固新战士工作中，一方面鼓励与适当安置新战士中地方干部积极分子，让他们当副班长，发挥其积极性；一方面又发动老战士开展普遍的爱护，把热炕棉被让出来，自己穿棉衣在干草地铺上躺，六十多个新战士，没有发生一个逃亡。提拔干部与选举模范结合起来，也收得很好成绩。去年冬提升五个排副、一个排长，年底都成了英雄，深得群众拥护。思想教育的进行，也采用群众路线，首先是根据战士实际思想出发，暴露问题，再综合起来，交给战士自己讨论解决。培养积极分子带头，引导战士盖情倾吐意见，特别是一中队，这次复仇立功搞的好，战士自己订出个人计划后，又帮助领导干部作计划，要求副队长搞好生活，把军事技术教给大家，副政委要注意自己脾气，多读报、上政治课、解决问题注意全面些等。副队长副政委笑容满面的接受了这些意见，又书面签名盖章传给各班，保证做到，真正做到领导与群众密切结合，使立功连动真正成为群众运动。（天富、刘光、吕梁）
