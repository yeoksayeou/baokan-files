    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 17th: TASS, Paris, 14th: The Women's International Democratic Federation released the following public statement to the press: Ms. Cai Chang, chairperson of the Women's Federation of the Chinese Liberated Areas, who attended the plenary session of the Women's International Democratic Federation in Prague, recently delivered to the Federation's secretariat a document on behalf of 20 million members, a petition addressed to the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference. The petition stated: In December 1945, the foreign ministers of the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union, at the Moscow Conference, specifically decided to abolish dictatorship, end the civil war, and guarantee the prohibition of all interference in China's internal affairs. However, despite this decision, the Chinese people continue to suffer under the dictatorial rule of the Kuomintang and a civil war soaked in blood. The main reason for this situation is the presence of a large number of American troops in China and the military and financial assistance given to the Kuomintang government. The women of the Chinese liberated areas urge the foreign ministers to discuss the China question at the Moscow Conference, demanding that the U.S. government abide by the principles decided at the conference in December 1945, and urging the United States to immediately withdraw American troops stationed in China, cease all military and financial assistance to the Kuomintang government, and stop all activities that maintain dictatorship and obstruct the establishment of peace, democracy, and independence in China. Cai Chang also sent two separate letters to the Secretariat of the Federation, one to Mrs. Roosevelt and one to the American Women's Association and all women's organizations in the United States who are members of the Women's International Democratic Federation, urging them to launch a movement to support the appeal of Chinese women and to strive for the cause of peace and democracy.

    解放区妇联代表致书外长会议
    要求讨论中国问题
    【新华社陕北十七日电】塔斯社巴黎十四日电：国际民主妇女联盟对报界发表如下公报：参加布拉格国际民主妇女联盟全体会议的中国解放区妇女联合会主席蔡畅女士，顷代表共二千万会员致送联盟书记一文件，致莫斯科外长会议的申请书。该申请书称：一九四五年十二月，英、美、苏三国外长在莫斯科会议上特别决定在中国要废止独裁，停止内战，并且保证禁止一切对中国内政的干涉。但是，虽然有了这一决定，中国人民依然在国民党独裁统治和血流遍野的内战之下痛苦呻吟。造成这种情形的主要原因，就是美国在中国的驻巨大数量的军队，并且给予国民党政府以军事及财政的援助。中国解放区妇女吁请诸外长在莫斯科会议中讨论中国问题，要求美国政府遵守一九四五年十二月在会议中决定的原则，并催促美国立即撤退驻华美军，停止对国民党政府一切军事财政援助，制止一切保持独裁专制及阻碍建立中国的和平民主与独立的活动。蔡畅同时另致送联盟书记处函信二件，一件致罗斯福夫人，一件致国际民主妇女联盟盟员美国妇女会及美国一切妇女团体，促请她们发起一个运动，支援中国妇女的呼吁，并为和平与民主的事业努力奋斗。
