　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, April 9th: New Delhi dispatch: The great unrest of the Indian people continues to expand. Even near Delhi, where Governor-General Mountbatten is holding political consultations, there is unrest. The British-Indian authorities have dispatched a large number of troops to suppress it. In Gurgaon, twenty miles from there, more than 150 people have been killed since the unrest began, and the number of injured is still unknown. In Calcutta, a state of emergency has been declared. Unrest has persisted there since March 26th. In Peshawar, a key point in the Northwest Frontier, Muslims held a strike and defied the 24-hour curfew to hold a large-scale demonstration protesting the arrest of Muslim leaders by the Congress Party's provincial government.

　　印度骚动继续扩展
    加尔各答进入紧急状态
    【新华社陕北九日电】新德里讯：印度人民的大骚动仍在继续扩展中，在印督蒙巴顿正举行政治协商的德里附近即骚动不已，英印当局已出动大量军队前往镇压，距该处二十英里的葛冈地方，自发生骚动以来，已击毙一百五十多人，受伤人数尚无从估计。加尔各答方面，已宣布进入紧急状态，该处自上月二十六日即发生骚动，迄未平静。在西北边部要隘白沙瓦地方，回教徒曾举行罢市，并不顾二十四小时之戒严令，举行大规模游行，抗议国民大会党省政府逮捕回教徒领袖。
