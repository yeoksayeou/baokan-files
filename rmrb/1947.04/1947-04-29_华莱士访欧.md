　　Wallace's Visit to Europe
    On the 12th of this month, former U.S. Vice President Henry Wallace visited Europe and has been giving speeches in major cities for several days. Just as the American reactionaries are loudly singing their tune of "aiding Greece and Turkey," "opposing the expansion of Communism," and implementing the same kind of anti-communist actions at home that Hitler did, such as "denouncing American Communists," and deliberately stalling things at the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference, Wallace's trip and his speeches illustrate how isolated the reactionary group of Truman, Vandenberg, Marshall, and others are. Even within the bourgeoisie itself, there are many, many people like Wallace who oppose the reactionary's self-destructive, adventurous policies. Moreover, as the reactionaries become more and more nakedly reactionary, and as the people's awareness and strength increase, more and more people like Wallace within the bourgeoisie will stand up and speak out. The division within the bourgeoisie is more severe after World War II than it was before World War II. The outward strength and inner weakness, the alienation and betrayal of the reactionaries, are more obvious than in the past; the main reason is the strength of the people's forces.
    In several of Wallace's speeches, he revealed that, in addition to giving political loans to Greece and Turkey, American imperialism is also preparing to give political loans to Korea, Hungary, China, Iran, Iraq, Japan, and Britain. He also pointed out that the methods the United States is currently employing against the Soviet Union are means of threat other than "war." The so-called "aid to Greece and Turkey" by American reactionaries is clearly an attempt to extend into the British sphere of influence and into the oil field regions.
    Wallace warned American imperialists not to bring about their own destruction, saying, "Even with the assistance of Britain, the United States will not be able to effectively develop itself throughout the world." He also said, "Attempting to terminate communism by assisting feudal regimes and interfering will not succeed." He pointed out, "Truman's unconditional loans to anti-Soviet governments are a corrupting, trivial, and useless plan." These are honest words, words of a thoughtful and perceptive person.
    Wallace said, "Communism is the idea of ending poverty and exploitation. To make communism superfluous, poverty and exploitation must no longer be part of democracy." In fact, for bourgeois democracy, poverty and exploitation are not only its "part" but also its foundation. Only new democracy does not base itself on poverty and exploitation.
    In his speech in Paris on the 22nd, Wallace said, "I find that the British working masses demand the greatest possible degree of understanding with the Soviet Union; Britain needs peace with the Soviet Union more than anything else." Here, Wallace points out the crux of the development of the international situation.
    Wallace's speeches in Europe have angered the British and American reactionaries. Winston Churchill, the British reactionary who gave a reactionary speech in the United States last March, was furious about Wallace's speech in Britain, saying that Wallace took advantage of Britain's generous hospitality to him, but he forgot that he himself had taken advantage of America's generous hospitality to himself. He said Wallace was a "concealed communist," forgetting that his own reactionary arguments are truly indistinguishable from Hitler's fascist theories. The only difference is that he changed "Aryan supremacy" to "English racial supremacy," which is truly an Anglo-American brand of fascism.
    The American reactionaries also clamored loudly, saying that Wallace was engaging in activities against the American government in foreign countries, and therefore had violated the "Loyalty Act" and should be sentenced to three years in prison and fined $5,000. However, even the American reactionaries, after Churchill fell from power and the Labor Party came to power, allowed Churchill to give a reactionary speech in the United States that violated the British Labor Party's platform, with Truman presiding at the speech, and no one said that the British government should sentence Churchill to three years in prison and fine him $5,000.
    The British and American reactionaries also shouted simultaneously that Wallace wanted to alienate Anglo-American relations, and therefore seemed to have committed some great crime. However, the Anglo-American reactionaries Churchill, Truman, Vandenberg, and others are opposing the Soviet Union every day, undermining the unity of Britain, America, and the Soviet Union. The American reactionaries' "aid" to Greece and Turkey will inevitably provoke British opposition, truly separating Britain and America. What Wallace is demanding is that Britain and America should not oppose the Soviet Union but should unite with the Soviet Union; the United States should not invade Greece and Turkey in the name of aid, leading to a falling out with Britain.
    The roaring of the British and American reactionaries shows that the reactionaries are so fragile that they cannot be touched and so unreasonable that they cannot be reasoned with. The only means of the reactionaries is to label everyone who is dissatisfied with the reactionaries as communists and threaten them with imprisonment and fines. The barbarity and unreasonableness of the reactionaries are completely exposed! The so-called "democracy" and "freedom of speech" mask of the reactionaries has also been torn off.

### 华莱士访欧

专栏：国际时评

　　华莱士访欧
    本月十二日，美前副总统华莱士访问欧洲，连日在各大都市演说。正当美国反动派在那里大唱其“援助希土”“反对共产主义的扩张”和在国内实行像希特勒所做过的那套反共行动如“检举美共”，在莫斯科外长会议上故意把事情闹僵的时候，华莱士的旅行及其所作的演说，说明了杜鲁门、范登堡、马歇尔等那批反动派是何等孤单，连资产阶级本身之中也有很多很多像华莱士这样的人，反对反动派自取灭亡的冒险政策。而且当反动派越来越强赤裸裸的反动之时，当人民的觉悟程度提高与力量增强之时，资产阶级中像华莱士这样的人就越多的会起来说话。资产阶级中间的分裂，第二次世界大战之后，比第二次世界大战之前更厉害了，反动派的外强中干、众叛亲离，比过去更明显了；主要原因是由于人民力量的强大。
    华莱士的几次演讲中，暴露美国帝国主义除了给予希土两国以政治借款之外，还准备给朝鲜、匈牙利、中国、伊朗、伊拉克、日本、英国以政治借款。他并且指出：美国现在对苏所采用的手段，是“战争”以外的其他威胁手段。美国反动派的所谓“援助希土”，显然是企图尽力伸入英国的势力范围，伸入油田区域去。
    华莱士警告美国帝国主义者不要自取灭亡，他说：“美国即在获得英国之协助时，仍无能力使本身在全世界作有效之发展。”又说：“欲借扶助封建政权并借干涉以终止共产主义，决不会成功。”他指出：“杜鲁门无条件贷款与反苏联政府，是败坏性琐碎无益的计划。”这些都是老实话，都是有头脑有眼光的话。
    华莱士说：“共产主义是终止贫穷与剥削之思想，要使共产主义成为多余的东西，则须使贫穷与剥削不再为民主之一部分。”事实上，对于资产阶级民主主义说，贫穷与剥削不仅是它的“一部分”，而且是它的基础。民主主义中只有新民主主义，才不以贫穷与剥削为基础。
    华莱士二十二日在巴黎的演说中说：“我发现英国工人群众要求与苏联作最大程度的谅解；英国需要对苏和平比一切东西都更重要。”这里华莱士是指出了国际时局发展的症结之点。
    华莱士在欧洲发表的演说，触怒了英美反动派。去年三月在美国发表反动演说的英国反动派邱吉尔，对于华莱士在英国发表演说大为愤怒，他说华莱士利用了英国对他的优渥的招待，但他忘记了自己就曾利用过美国对他自己的优渥招待。他说华莱士是“隐蔽的共产党员”，他忘记了他自己的反动论调才真正与希特勒法西斯理论没有区别，唯一的区别，是把“阿莉安种至上”改为“英语种族至上”而已，这才是真正英美牌的法西斯。
    美国的反动派也大声叫嚣，说华莱士在外国活动反对美国政府，所以犯了“效忠法”，要判三年徒刑与五千元罚金；但是，就是美国反动派，在邱吉尔倒台工党上台后，让邱吉尔在美国发表违反英国工党政纲的反动演说，演说时还有杜鲁门当主席，并无人说英国政府应该叛邱吉尔判三年徒刑与五千元罚金。
    英美反动派又同时大叫说：华莱士要离间英美关系，因此似乎就犯了什么大罪；但是，英美反动派邱吉尔、杜鲁门、范登堡等，天天在反苏，破坏英美与苏联的团结。美国反动派“援助”希土，其结果必然是激起英国的反对，真正分离英美。而华莱士所要求的乃是：英美不应反苏，而应与苏联团结；美国不应以援助为名侵略希土，以致与英国闹翻。
    英美反动派的咆哮，说明反动派是脆弱到碰也碰不得，无理到说也说不得。反动派的唯一手段，就是把一切不满反动派的人都说成是共产党，都以徒刑和罚金相威胁。反动派的野蛮无理，完全暴露出来了！反动派的所谓“民主”与“言论自由”的假面具，也揭穿了。（新华社陕北二十七日电）
