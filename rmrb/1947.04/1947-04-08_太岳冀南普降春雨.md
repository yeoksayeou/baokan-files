　　Spring Rain Falls in Taiyue and Southern Hebei
　　[This newspaper, Taiyue, 7th dispatch] Spring rain has generally fallen in various parts of Taiyue. It started at 3:00 AM on March 31st and lasted until 3:00 PM. In Yangcheng, Jincheng, Tumin, Gaoping, Wangwu, Jiyuan, Qingshui and other counties, the rainfall was one to two inches. The wheat seedlings in the villages are a tender green. According to experienced old farmers: "Wheat harvest depends on eight, ten, three rains: if there is one rain in March, the wheat on the mountains is guaranteed to yield 80%, and the wheat on the thick land at the foot of the mountains can yield 100%."
　　[This newspaper, Southern Hebei, 7th dispatch] Wheat seedlings need rain, and the sowing season has arrived. A general spring rain fell in the southern Hebei plain on March 31st. Looking out at the boundless green of the fertile fields, the old saying "spring rain is as precious as oil" rings true, and the peasants who have returned to their land are overjoyed. Farmers are talking on the streets: "I have also been allocated land, and the sky has given us a thorough rain. We have been liberated, and even the heavens are helping us. As soon as the weather clears up, let's hurry up and plow the land!" Their excitement is boundless.

　　太岳冀南普降春雨
    【本报太岳七日电】太岳各地普降春雨。三月卅一日晨三时始，下午三时止。阳城、晋城、土敏、高平、王屋、济源、沁水等县，均落雨一、二寸不等。乡村麦苗一片嫩绿。据有经验之老农说：“麦收八、十、三场雨：三月有一场雨，山上麦子保证可收八成，山下厚地麦子可收十成。”
    【本报冀南七日电】麦苗须雨，播种期至，冀南平原三十一日普降春雨。展望连天沃野，无边碧绿，古语“春雨贵如油”，土地回老家的翻身农民更是喜出望外。农民在街头上谈论着：“我也分了地，天也下透雨了，咱们翻了身，老天也助劲，一会天晴了，赶紧耕地吧！”言下无限兴奋。
