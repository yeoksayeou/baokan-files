    (This report from Taihang on the 23rd) In Xiaodianhe Village, Quxian First District, cadres, militia, and self-defense forces have all gone to participate in the war. It has rained a bit, and the time to plant cotton has arrived. It would be bad for seedling emergence if it is delayed. More than a dozen old men in the village, including Shang Chen, calculated all the cotton fields to be planted in the village, a total of sixty mu. They also had seven head of livestock, mobilized women and children, coordinated their efforts, set aside other unimportant tasks, and went all out to rush planting. In five days, all sixty mu of cotton fields were planted. When the war participants returned, they were very happy. In order to do its best to support the front lines without delaying production, the district specifically praised the experience of Xiaodianhe Village, asking all villages to learn from them and organize all male and female semi-laborers and all auxiliary labor to participate in production.

    小店河妇女儿童搭配好
    突击种完全部棉田
    【本报太行廿三日电】汲县一区小店河村干部、民兵、自卫队都去参战，天下了些雨，种棉花的时候到了，如耽误了就不好出苗。村里尚辰等十几个老汉就把全村要种的花地计算了一下，共六十亩，还有七犋牲口，把妇女儿童都动员起来，搭配开，把其他不重要活丢开，全力突击下种，五天内便将六十亩花地全部种上。参战人回来，心中非常高兴。该区为了作到全力支援前线，并不误生产。特把小店河村经验加以表扬，让各村都学习他们，把全村男女半劳力及一切辅助劳力都组织起来参加生产。
