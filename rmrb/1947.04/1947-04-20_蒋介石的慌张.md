Xinhua News Agency Short Commentary:

　　Chiang Kai-shek's Panic

　　To what extent is Chiang Kai-shek panicking? It can be seen from Chiang's inspection of the Youth Army in Shanghai on the 14th. Chiang Kai-shek himself was in Shanghai that day, but he dared not go by car to inspect, but instead first took a car to Longhua Airport, then took a plane to Jiangwan Airport, and then took a car from Jiangwan Airport to Hongkou Park for inspection. Chiang Kai-shek has to travel such a large circle to walk in the city he controls, which shows that this traitorous fascist head is extremely timid and fearful. The so-called "admonition" given by Chiang Kai-shek during the inspection of the Youth Army was written by the Central News Agency into a stereotyped essay as bland as chewing wax; it can be seen that Chiang Kai-shek did not even dare to publish what he said. However, the Associated Press published it for him. In the so-called admonition, Chiang Kai-shek wanted the Youth Army to "crush" the "Communist rebels," saying that the Communist Party "disrupted peace throughout China," causing "most Chinese people to suffer great pain and death," "reduced China's international status," and "deteriorated the living standards of the Chinese people." The Associated Press report immediately made people understand: why Chiang Kai-shek did not dare to publish the fart he let out. The reason is very simple, that is, all of China and the world know that this civil war was launched by Chiang Kai-shek, not by the Communist Party. Without a thousand or ten thousand proofs, Hu Zongnan's attack on Yan'an on the 13th of last month is the evidence before our eyes. If Chiang Kai-shek publishes his set of nonsense, wouldn't it be tantamount to announcing his crimes in front of everyone? So it's no wonder that Chiang Kai-shek only dared to try to deceive the Youth Army, but never dared to publish his so-called "admonition." During this inspection, Chiang Kai-shek called on his Youth Army to shout oaths such as "eliminate obstacles to the revolution" and "Long live the Chairman." And he also gathered some of the Youth Army members who had been demobilized to listen to his speech, trying to mobilize them to fight desperately together. This is like Chiang Kai-shek, at the end of his rope, like a person who is about to drown in the sea, desperately grabbing any piece of wood that floats to his hand. Chen Cheng and others also attended this inspection, which shows that Chiang Kai-shek is launching a movement across the country to save his dying fate. However, Chiang Kai-shek only has a pair of hands begging from American imperialism. Since American imperialism cannot solve his political, military, and economic crises, what life-saving method can he think of?

### 蒋介石的慌张

　　蒋介石的慌张
    蒋介石慌乱到什么程度，从十四日蒋在上海检阅青年军一事中，就可以看出来。蒋介石那天，自己就在上海，但不敢乘车前往检阅，而是先坐车到龙华飞机场，再坐飞机到江湾飞机场，再由江湾飞机场坐车到虹口公园检阅。蒋介石在其自己所控制的城市里走路，要绕这样大的圈子，足见这个卖国贼法西斯头子，心虚胆怯已达极点。蒋介石在检阅青年军时的所谓“训词”，中央社把它写成一篇味同嚼蜡的八股；可见蒋介石连自己说的话都不敢公布出来。但是，美联社却给他公布了，在所谓训词里，蒋介石要青年军“粉碎”“中共叛军”，说中共“扰乱全中国和平”，使“中国大部分人民遭受重大痛苦与死亡”，“使中国国际地位降低”，“使中国人民生活水准恶化”。美联社的报导令人立即懂得：为什么蒋介石不敢将自己放出的屁公布出来的原因。原因很简单，就是全中国、全世界都知道：此次内战是蒋介石发动的，而不是中共发动的。一千个一万个证明都不说，上月十三日胡宗南进攻延安，就是眼前的证据。如果蒋介石把他的一套狗屁公布出来，岂不等于在大家面前宣布自己的罪状？所以怪不得蒋介石只敢对青年军企图欺骗一下，却决不敢公布其所谓“训词”了。此次检阅中，蒋介石叫他的青年军高呼所谓“扫除革命障碍”，和“主席万岁”等赌咒发誓。并且把已经复员了的一部青年军分子也召集起来，听他训话，企图动员他们一起拚命。这是蒋介石势穷力竭，像在大海中将近溺毙的人，死命扳住飘到手边的任何一块木板一样。此次检阅中，陈诚等亦到场，可见蒋介石正在全国发动一个运动，以挽救其垂死的命运。但是，蒋介石光有一双对美国帝国主义讨乞的手，既然美国帝国主义都不能解决其政治、军事、经济各方面的危机，又有什么救命办法可想呢？
