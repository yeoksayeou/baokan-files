    Disregarding Hardship and Fighting Behind Enemy Lines,
    Comrade Zhang Junshan Gloriously Sacrificed His Life
    Taihang Fourth Administrative Office Issues Special Commendation
    [Our newspaper, Wen County news] Zhang Junshan, the chief of the Fourth District of Wen County, sacrificed his life in a battle with the enemy in Shuangliu Village, Qin South. Zhang was 30 years old, from Handan. At the age of thirteen, he was sold to Zuoquan as a young monk due to famine. In March of the 28th year of the Republic (1939), he joined the anti-Japanese work. He was consistently active and responsible in his work, and studied diligently. In February of this year, he led a work team to advance into Qin South, adhering to guerrilla warfare, determined to protect the interests of the masses who had turned over. Day and night, he ate in the open and slept in the open. During the battles of enduring hunger and cold, he had no complaints. He once led the people to crush two major enemy sieges and became a brave commander in battle. On the 11th of last month, he received information that Zhou Zefu, the puppet village chief of Shuangliu Village, was leading the self-defense corps to oppress the masses in the village. He immediately resolved to eliminate this scourge for the people. He immediately joined an independent battalion platoon, and after breakfast, raided the village. The stubborn puppets fled. He immediately convened a mass meeting to inspire the masses to carry out struggles against "reversal of settlements" and other struggles. Later, the enemy gathered more than 200 stubborn puppets, carrying five machine guns, and surrounded the village. He led the people to break through bravely. The enemy then pursued, and in a hail of bullets, he resolutely and calmly fought back. Unfortunately, he was wounded in the right abdomen, and the bullet pierced through his intestines. He passed away at Jia Village in the middle of the night. When the news came, the entire district was filled with grief and indignation. The Administrative Office issued a special commendation on March 30th, and according to the opinions of the masses, renamed Shuangliu Village to Junshan Village, as a permanent memorial.
