　　[This newspaper's Ping Shun dispatch] The village of Shazhizhan in the Second District has 99 households with 277 people, owning 500.034 mu of land. There are 68 full male laborers. Nine joined the army and left, and 21 militiamen left for this battle. Four people left to do business elsewhere, leaving the whole village with only 24 full or semi-laborers, calculated as full laborers. Under these circumstances of much land and little labor, the masses developed several ideological problems: First, the families of those who joined the army or returned to the ranks felt that there was land but no one to cultivate it, and the cadres only talked about helping but it was not effective. The attitude was "whoever leaves suffers." Second, the families of those who joined the army or returned to the ranks felt that their men had left and they did not know when they would return, so it was better to eat and drink for a few days and not bother with spinning and weaving. Third, the village cadres felt distressed that all the full laborers had left, and that the participating personnel and new soldiers would not be able to cultivate the land when they returned. For example, Qin Shuicheng, the chairman of the farmers' association, and Shen Changze, the village chief, both said there was nothing they could do and worried every day. After discovering these thoughts, labor hero Li Shunda convened a meeting of village cadres on March 29 to specifically discuss and resolve these difficulties and ideological problems. At this meeting, Shunda said that worrying alone would not help, and to solve this difficulty, it was necessary to implement a village-wide large-scale labor exchange, with the whole village using work points uniformly. After Shunda proposed it, everyone promptly studied the preferential treatment methods for calculating work points and for the front and rear labor exchanges. The whole village uniformly used work points, with 100 points per household as a principle, and the wages would be calculated and paid according to the number of work points at the final settlement. Then, the labor and livestock quotas were determined. Those participating in the war in the front ate at public expense, so the laborers at home worked harder, earning ten points per person per day. The laborers at home were assigned points according to their situation; those who could earn ten points earned ten points, and those who could earn five points earned five points. Livestock was classified and assigned points: first-class livestock earned 20 points a day, second-class livestock earned 15 points, and third-class livestock earned 12 points (regardless of feed). It was also stipulated that the wages would be: human labor received five catties of rice with meals provided, or seven catties of rice without meals provided. For preferential treatment, military dependents and wealthy people were divided into three classes. The wealthiest military dependents contributed up to eight points (without meals) during preferential treatment, and the lowest contributed three points. The average person contributed nothing without meals. As for military dependents of participating personnel, the issue of firewood and water was handled by mutual aid teams, taking turns to supply and also earning points. After these appropriate methods for calculating wages and work points were clearly stipulated, everyone felt that the difficulty of having much land and no one to cultivate it was resolved, which improved their morale. Then, a labor exchange committee was elected, consisting of labor hero Li Shunda, the logistics director, the civil affairs director, the village chief, and others to lead the village's large-scale labor exchange.

　　[Another News] After the conscription in Gumanpu, Sixth District, 50 more people went to participate in the war. The military dependents and some elderly people left at home did not work, but only worried, sighing and saying, "We old people are left, we can't carry manure, and we can't build ridges. It will be very difficult to cultivate the land this year." After the cadres heard this, they immediately held a meeting to discuss it, and as a result, they proposed: "If you don't sow seeds in the spring, you'll be angry to death in the fall." Everyone organized, the elderly drove livestock to deliver manure, and used cloth bags to carry it without saddles, separating the light and heavy work, and sending one more load of manure to the land was better than not sending any. The next day, the cadres went to various villages to mobilize, which stimulated everyone's enthusiasm for production. Guo Youku, who was over 50 years old, said, "To win the battle, the old and young must work together; to cultivate well for military dependents, compensation must be paid for any shortage of grain." Chen Jinshui, a military dependent, was also moved and said, "My son has gone to join the army, and everyone is so concerned. There are also many people who have gone to participate in the war. I will also move around properly and cultivate all the land. The front will win the battle, and the rear will produce more grain, to protect the good times." (Da Hua, Qiu Bao)

　　民兵上前方春耕不能误
  　沙地栈全村大变工
  　克服劳力困难谷蛮铺男女老小齐动手
    【本报平顺讯】二区沙地栈村九十九户二百七十七口人，共有地五百亩零三分四厘，共男全劳力六十八个，归队参军走了九个，这次参战民兵又走了二十一个，脱离在外做生意的四个，现全村全半劳力折全劳力只留有二十四个。在这种地多劳力少的情况下，群众产生了几种思想问题：第一、参军参战归队家属感到有地没人种，干部是光说帮助不顶事，还是走了谁苦了谁。第二、参军及归队家属感到自己男人走了，还不知何时才回来，不如大吃大喝几天算了，纺织也不起劲。第三、村干部认为全劳力都走了，参战人员及新战士回来种不上地，感到苦闷。如农会主席秦水成、村长申长则二人都说没办法，每天发愁。在发现这些思想后，劳动英雄李顺达三月二十九日召开村干部会议，专门讨论解决这一困难及思想问题。在这一会议上，顺达说光发愁不顶事，要想解决这一困难，非实行全村大变工不可，全村统一使用工票。经顺达提出后，大家就及时研究了折工及前后方大变工的优抗办法，全村统一使用工票，每户以一百分为原则，最后算账时，按工票多少来算账出工资。接着就把劳力及牲口分额订出，在前方参战者吃的公家，因此在家劳力吃苦些，每人每天顶十分。在家的劳力，按情况计分折工，能顶十分计十分，能顶五分顶五分。畜力上是分开等级计分：头等牲口一天顶二十分，二等牲口顶十五分，三等牲口顶十二分（不管草料）。并规定了工资：人力管饭出工资米五斤，不管饭出七斤米，优抗时一般军属和富裕者分三等，富裕军属优抗时最高出资八分（不管饭），最低者出三分，一般者不管饭不出工资。至于军属参战人员，柴水问题是以互助小组为单位，轮流供用也顶分。经这样适当的把工资与折工的办法明确规定出后，大家感觉地多无人种的困难得到了解决，提高了情绪。接着推选出变工委员会，由劳动英雄李顺达后勤主任民事主任村长等四人组成，来领导全村的大变工。（成蛟、王碧）
    【又讯】该县六区谷蛮铺参军结束后，又去参战五十多人，留在家里的军属家长和一些老年人都不劳动，光发愁，唉声叹气的说：“剩上咱这些老年人，担不动粪，垒不了壑，今年种地很困难。”干部听到这种反映，随即开会讨论，结果提出：“春天不种籽，秋后气个死”。大家组织起来，老年人赶牲口送粪，没鞍子用布袋驮，分开轻重活，多往地送一担粪比不送强。第二日，干部分头到各庄动员，把大家生产劲头激发起来，五十多岁的郭有库说：“要得打胜仗，老孩一齐上；要给军属代耕好，少打粮食要赔偿。”军属陈金水也感动的说：“我儿去参军，大家这样关心，还有很多人去参战，我也好好动弹，都种上地，前方打胜仗，后方多打粮，保卫好时光。”（大华、秋保）
