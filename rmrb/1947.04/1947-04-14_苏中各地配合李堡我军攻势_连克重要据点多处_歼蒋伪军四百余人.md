Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 11th: Simultaneously with the Hai'an-@ (Cha) Line campaign, local armed forces in various parts of Central Jiangsu took advantage of the situation to launch attacks. In the first five days of this month, the People's Army also recovered Lan'gang Bridge, more than ten miles northeast of Jinsha in central Nantong, as well as eight strongholds including Shizhuang, a major town in Rugao, and Zhoujiazhuang, Yanjiazhuang, Jiangjiazhuang, Zhangbuzhuang, Lujiazhuang, and Daixiaozhuang. They killed and captured 309 Chiang and puppet troops, seizing 160 rifles, 12 light machine guns, 5 short guns, 2 carbines, Thompson submachine guns, grenade launchers, small cannons, and one warhorse, as well as nearly 10,000 rounds of ammunition. Among the larger battles, the Nantong local armed forces recovered Lan'gang Bridge on the 5th, eliminating and capturing over 100 Chiang troops, seizing 10 light machine guns and 85 rifles, and destroying 16 large and small bunkers in the area. The Zishi local armed forces swept through the Chiang army in the Hai'an (north) area on the 3rd and 4th, eliminating 96 Chiang and puppet troops, posing a significant threat to the Chiang army on the Hai'an-Taizhou line. Since the 1st, the people of Rudong have launched large-scale sabotage on both sides of the Rugao-Juegang line. Tens of thousands of people dismantled the line overnight, effectively hindering the Chiang army's plan to reinforce the Hai@ line northward.

Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 10th: On the night of the 1st of this month, the local armed forces of the Second Sub-district of Central Jiangsu launched a fierce attack on the Daixiaozhuang stronghold between Wangzhigang and Taolin in Baoying, completely resolving the defending enemy after an hour of fierce fighting. Over 60 people including Chiang's Baoying County Government Security Team were captured, over 20 were killed or wounded, and 2 light machine guns, 27 long and short guns, and over 1,000 rounds of ammunition were seized.
