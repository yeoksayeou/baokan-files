　　Gaotang and Pingyuan Counties Transfer Cadres
    to New Areas to Mobilize the Masses
    [This newspaper, Jinnan, 17th] Gaotang and Pingyuan counties transferred cadres to the new areas to mobilize the masses. In Gaotang's First District, after a major movement last year, there were still twenty-two villages in the southeast of the city, twenty-three villages in the northeast of the city, and a small number of villages in the west of the city where the masses had not been mobilized. The main reason was that the leadership itself did not pay enough attention to the work in the new areas. It has now been decided to carry out the work in the new areas as the current central task, and to strengthen the allocation of cadres in the new areas. A large number of cadres have been transferred from the old areas to work in the district. The Pingyuan County Committee also transferred dozens of stronger village cadres from the old areas to form a turnaround team. After half a month of training, on March 23rd, they arrived in the new areas to carry out work.

　　高唐平原抽调干部
    分赴新区发动群众
    【本报冀南十七日电】高唐、平原抽调干部赴新区发动群众。高唐一区经去年大动后，尚有城东南二十二村、城东北二十三村及城西少数村庄，群众未发动起来，原因主要是由于领导本身对新区工作重视不够。现决定开展新区工作为目前中心任务，并加强新区干部配备，已由老区抽调大批干部到达该区工作。平原县委会也从老区抽调数十名较强村干，组成翻身队，经过半月训练，于三月二十三日，分抵新区，开展工作。
