(Our newspaper's report from Lucheng) The eleven villages including former Zhang, jointly convened a six-day training session starting on the 16th of last month, gathering around 800 people including male and female activists, cadres, "backward" masses, and some middle peasants; it eliminated the masses' pitiable landlord ideology and recognized the rationality and legality of struggle. The training was initiated using the method of "pouring out grievances," but it didn't take off, as the masses felt that meetings for pouring out grievances didn't present any new problems, and they didn't want to pour them out. The leadership then immediately accepted the masses' opinions and adopted the method of "inspiring peasants to visit heroic struggle stories in history." From visiting the stories, the peasants were educated to recognize the following issues: One peasant said, "Xi × Wang Xiaowu and two others worked as hired laborers for the landlord, were beaten and cursed, and couldn't get enough to eat. The three workers were dissatisfied, and when plowing the field, they set the small plow deeper, making it heavier and heavier. In less than half a month, it killed four of his livestock. He said, 'If I can't do it openly, I have to vent my anger secretly.' The landlord said this was 'stifling conscience.' But who is really stifling conscience?" This comparison enlightened everyone, and they realized that resisting the landlord was justified. Everyone also heard about Wu Xiao×, a brick burner from Anju, who burned bricks for a landlord in Zhangzi, Changzhi. Three workers ate the landlord's melons but didn't have money, so the landlord stripped them of their clothes. The workers were indignant, united with and colluded with four "watchmen" (guarding crops), and stole half a mu of grapes and four mu of melons from the landlord in the middle of the night, throwing them into the Zhang River. The landlord went to search for them in the middle of the night but couldn't find them; instead, they were caught by the workers, who said the landlord had stolen the quilts and sent him to the village office. The villagers mediated, invited guests, and wrote a statement of settlement to resolve the matter. Everyone said, "They are numerous, resourceful, and united, but they still can't turn themselves over." The conclusion was, "The strength of united struggle is great, but it doesn't count without the Communist Party." Through visiting historical struggle stories like this, the peasants' enthusiasm was raised. Some peasants stayed up at night discussing, analyzing, and researching, using many concrete facts to prove the justice of the struggle. The peasants were filled with a lively and joyful spirit after their liberation. (Xingfu, Anzhong, Renfu, Wang Jian, Xinghai, Guizhong, Jiangxi)

　　故漳等十一村开“农民大学”
    访斗争故事提高觉悟
    【本报潞城讯】故漳等十一村联合于上月十六号召集了男女积极分子干部和“落后”群众及一部分中农约八百余人，进行了六天的集训；解除了群众可怜地主思想，认识了斗争的合理合法。训练开展采取了“诉苦”的方法，但诉不进去，群众认为开会诉苦，再没新的问题，不想诉。领导上当时即接受群众意见，采取了“启发农民访历史上英勇的斗争故事”的方法，从访故事中教育了农民认识了以下问题：一个农民说“西×王小五等三人给地主当雇工，吃打受骂吃不饱，三个伙计心不满，犁地时把小犁寨下深些，越拉越重，不到半个月，窜死了他四个牲口，他说，明里不敢干，暗地里也要出出这口气。地主说这是闷良心，到底谁闷良心呢？”这一对比，大家心上都亮了，认识到反抗地主是应该的。大家又访到安居吴小×是个烧砖的工人，在长治漳子给地主烧砖，伙计三人吃了地主家瓜，没钱被地主剥去了衣服，伙计们不服劲，团结与串通了四个“看口”（看庄稼），半夜偷了地主的半亩葡四亩瓜，扔到漳河，地主半夜去搜他没搜出来，反被他们抓住，说地主偷了被子，送他到村公所，同村人说合，请了客，俱了结状才算了事，大家说：“他们人多计高团结好，但也翻不了身。”大家的结论是：“团结斗争力量大，离了共产党也不算话。”经过这样访历史斗争故事，提高了农民的情绪，有的农民黑夜不睡觉，也在讨论分析研究，用许多具体的事实，证明了斗争的正义性，农民充满着翻身后的生动活泼愉快的情绪。（兴福、安忠、仁富、王健、兴孩、桂忠、江喜）
