(Our Report from Shahe) After the land reform movement, North Zhang Village is now a first-class village in the new district. Currently, the focus is on production combined with ideological education. After seven or eight days of class division and ideologically separating themselves from the landlords, everyone recognized that the landlords exploited us in the past, and it was completely justified to struggle against them. They also examined their past reluctance to take land and their "conscience" thoughts. Then, the discussion turned to whether we have exploited others? Nie Qingshan said, "What do we have to exploit others with? Anyway, we're just flesh and blood, so we might as well just suffer for others." Subsequently, the leadership proposed that now that we have turned ourselves around and are no longer exploited, and we have capital for farming, how do we want our lives to be in the future? What are everyone's thoughts? Middle peasant Song Xilun said, "In the past, I wanted to improve my life, but since the struggle started, I always thought that I already had a lot of land, and it would be good if people didn't criticize me. In addition, the landlords threatened me, saying that after they were struggled against, it would be my turn, so I didn't dare to move at all. How could I have any energy for production? Now I understand that I was also ruled by the landlords in the past, and I will definitely move forward in the future!" Han Lu said, "I thought we probably couldn't avoid being struggled against either. In the past, I didn't even use my strength to push the cart. Now I understand that we are all one family, and I'm not afraid anymore. I will definitely put in more effort in the future, and the two little donkeys will also be busy transporting and earning more money." The peasants who had been allocated fruits of the struggle also made self-criticisms. Liu Chenggun said, "I used to be very diligent and careful, but after the land reform, I became less careful because I had food to eat. I'm also lazier than before." Han Ji said, "Last year, I was allocated land south of North Zhang, and when I went there, I was afraid that people would talk, so I didn't dare to go through the village and always had to go around outside the village. Now I think it's all the same, that's my own land." From then on, everyone said that as long as they worked hard and didn't exploit others in the future, there would be no struggle. If they just sat around and ate without producing, their lives would not improve. The middle peasants' enthusiasm was also raised.

　　北掌经过划分阶级解除中农发家顾虑
    【本报沙河讯】北掌村经过翻身运动，在新区是一类村。目前是生产结合思想教育。经过七、八天的划分阶级和从思想上与地主分家后，都认清了过去地主剥削咱们，被斗是完全应当的，并检讨了过去不敢要地与良心思想。接着便讨论咱们剥削过人没有？聂清山说：“咱拿上什么去剥削人家，反正咱是个肉身子，横顺是给人家受就算了。”随后领导上提出咱们现在翻了身不受剥削了，种地有了本钱，以后咱们的光景要怎样过？大家都有些什么想法？中农宋锡伦说：“以前光景想往上长，自从闹了斗争，我总想自己地不少了，人家不给咱提意见就是好的，另外地主还威胁我，说斗了他们就该我了，于是我就越不敢动一动了，生产那里还有劲呢？我现在才想通，过去自己也是被地主统治的，以后我一定还要往前过哩！”韩禄的说：“我想咱这光景恐怕也躲不过挨斗，过去我推小车的力气也不用了，现在我闹清了，都是一家人，我不怕了，今后还要拿出力量来干，两个小驴还要忙着运输多赚钱哩。”分得果实的翻身户也都作了检讨，刘成群说：“我过去顶勤俭仔细，翻身后有了吃的，就不大仔细了。人也比前懒了。”韩纪的说：“我去年分得南掌南的地、去的时候害怕人家说，不敢从村里过，总要绕到村外去，现在我认为是一样了，那就是我自己的地。”从此大家都说只要以后好好劳动不剥削人，就不能斗争，要不生产光坐着吃，光景还是弄不好，中农的情绪也提高了。
