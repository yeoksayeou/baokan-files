　　【Report from Jinnan, this newspaper, 16th】The Ningnan Third District, in its re-examination, overcame the complacent thinking of "good enough," and deeply mobilized the "backward" masses. From March 15th to 30th, seventeen villages re-struggled against 89 households of landlords who had been missed or not thoroughly struggled against, unearthing a large amount of property. For example, in Cuiguan Village, when the inspection began, the chairman of the Farmers' Association said, "Twenty households have already been struggled against, there are no more landlords." After in-depth investigation, the cadres' thinking was straightened out, and another fourteen households of landlords who had not been thoroughly struggled against or had been missed were discovered, and the struggle was launched. The landlord Zhao Xiqing pretended to be poor all day long, wearing ragged clothes, and deliberately borrowed grain seeds when farming. Once, he deliberately bought only four taels of mixed noodles on the street. This time, the masses dug out ten bags of mung beans from his house. It was also discovered that two landlords' cattle were being raised in the homes of relatives in other villages, and when the autumn wheat was brought in, it was said to be borrowed. There were also many supplies hidden in the homes of "backward" masses. When the inspection began in Bijiazhuang, some of the masses said, "The landlords in our village have all been struggled against. The landlord Wu Yuexuan even borrows seeds from others when farming." Later, after the district cadres' enlightenment, in group discussions, another nine households of landlords who had not been thoroughly struggled against were discovered. A total of more than 2,000 pieces of cabinets, furniture, clothing, etc., worth 3 million yuan in ocean currency, were cleared out from the ten landlord households. In Aixinzhuang, because village cadres wasted the fruits of the mass movement last year, the masses' morale was low. The district cadres then put forward the need to clear up the accounts and redistribute the fruits, and at the same time proposed re-investigating missed and not thoroughly struggled against landlords, and called on members to report hidden landlord supplies. The "backward" members initially did not want to contribute, but were later educated with examples of landlords' viciousness and ruthlessness, such as "In lean years, they sell their sons and daughters, why don't the landlords give them anything," etc., and they all confessed and contributed: including clothing, furniture, porcelain, silverware, jade, agate, court beads, etc., worth a total of 20 million yuan.

　　宁南三区深入“落后”查隐蔽
    发现地主装穷没斗透
    【本报冀南十六日电】宁南三区复查，克服“差不多”的自满思想，深入发动“落后”群众，自三月十五日至三十日，十七个村重斗遗漏和未斗透的地主八十九户，斗出大批财物。如崔官庄开始检查时，农会主任即说：“已斗了二十户了，没有地主了。”深入调查后，打通了干部思想，又发现十四户未斗彻底和遗漏的地主，遂展开斗争。地主赵西庆，成天装穷，穿破衣，种地时故意借粮种，有一次故意在街上只买四两杂面。这次群众从他家挖出十袋绿豆。并发现两户地主的牛在外村亲戚家喂养，秋麦牵来，说是借的。还有很多物资隐藏在“落后”群众家里。毕家庄开始检查时，群众有的说：“俺村地主斗完了，地主吴月轩种地还向别人借种籽哩。”后经区干启发，分组讨论中，又发现九户地主没斗透。十户地主共清出柜箱家具衣物等两千多件，值洋三百万元。艾辛庄因去年群运中村干浪费果实，群众情绪低落，区干遂一面提出要清理账目，重分果实，一面提出重查遗漏和未斗透的地主，号召会员自报隐藏的地主物资，“落后”会员开始不愿献，后以“歉年自己卖儿卖女，地主为什么不给一点东西”等等地主狠毒无情的事例，进行了教育，都坦白献出来：计衣被、家具、磁器、银器、玉石、玛璃、朝珠等，共值两万万元。
