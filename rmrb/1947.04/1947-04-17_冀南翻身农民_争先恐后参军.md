[Report from our newspaper in Southern Hebei on the 15th] The turned-over peasants in Southern Hebei are launching a wave of enlistment in the army. In Congcun Village, Fourth District of Handan, nine peasants including Liu Dengkui, some sent their husbands to join the army, others had brothers joining. Zhang Jinhua, the deputy director of the women's association, persuaded her husband to join the army, and Shi Lanyun, the militia squad leader, took the lead in signing up to go to the front lines to earn merit. In three or four days, 22 young peasants signed up to join the army, and the villagers recorded their names in the book of merit. At the mobilization meeting in Wuxun, village cadres from Dazhuang, Dasangshu, Wuhaizi, Wuxun Town, Qiaozhuang, Jiepai and other villages challenged each other to compete in enlisting. Su Changrui, the village chief of Wuzhuang, signed up on the spot, and Ma Ruzhang, the representative of the families of soldiers from Suhezai, also voluntarily signed up. During the enlistment campaign in Qiuxian, Wang Fengming from Xichangtun, Third District, resolutely stated: "I used to have little to eat or drink. The Communist Party came and gave us land to cultivate, and also provided grain loans to help with production. I always wanted to repay this kindness. This time, I'll let my son Xiaoyu repay the favor by joining the army." After the meeting, he ran home and said to his wife, "Now we won't go hungry anymore, we have land to cultivate, and we've also been allocated timber to build a house." Xiaoyu's mother said, "If it weren't for the Communist Party, what would you have relied on?" Wang Fengming was very happy to hear this, and said, "The Eighth Route Army treats us so well, what good have we done for the Eighth Route Army?" Xiaoyu's mother said, "In the future, whatever work the Eighth Route Army assigns us, we must do it quickly." Fengming said, "That's right, now is the time to join the army, let's have our Xiaoyu join the army." Xiaoyu's mother said, "No, our child has just grown up and can do work, why would you let him join the army?" Wang Fengming said, "It doesn't matter, I'm not too old, I can do all the work at home." Xiaoyu's mother said, "No, I won't let him go." Wang Fengming said, "If our child doesn't go, who will? Joining the army is a glorious thing. You tell me, the Eighth Route Army treats us so well, if we don't join the army, who will? Besides, joining the army is also for our good." After a day and a night of mobilization, Xiaoyu's mother finally understood, and the couple then mobilized Xiaoyu to sign up.

　　冀南翻身农民
    争先恐后参军
    【本报冀南十五日电】冀南翻身农民掀起参军浪潮。邯郸四区丛中村农民刘登奎等九人，有的送夫参军，有的兄弟参军，妇会副主任张金华说服自己的丈夫参军，民兵班长师兰芸带头报名上前线立功。三四天内，青年农民报名参军者达二十二名，该村农民都把他们记上功劳簿。武训参军动员大会上，大杨庄、大桑树、吴海子、武训镇，乔庄、界牌等村干部，相互提出挑战，竞赛参军。武庄苏长瑞当场报名参军，苏何寨抗属总代表马汝章亦自动报名。邱县参军运动中，三区西常屯王风明坚决表示：“我从前少吃无喝，共产党来了有了地种，又贷粮贷款帮助生产，我整天想报恩，在这次参军中叫俺小玉报恩去”。会后，他跑回家去对妻子一说：“现在咱可不挨饿了，有地种啦，盖房也分了木料”。小玉娘说：“要不是共产党，你凭着啥？”王风明听说很高兴，又说：“八路军待咱这样好，咱对八路军有那点好呢”？小玉娘说：“咱以后只要八路军布置啥工作，咱要赶快去做”。风明说：“正好，现在正是参军时候哩，叫咱小玉去参军吧”。小玉娘说：“不中，咱孩子好容易长的才能做活呀，你叫他参军去”？王风明说：“不要紧，我年纪又不大，家的活我啥也能干”。小玉娘说：“不中，我不叫去”。王风明说：“咱孩子不去，叫谁去？参军是光荣事，叫你说，八路军待咱的好处这样多，咱不参军谁参军，再说参军也是为了咱好过日子呀”。经过一天一夜的动员，结果小玉娘想开了，两口子又动员小玉报了名。
