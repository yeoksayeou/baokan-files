　　To Increase Production
    What to Note When Planting Cotton?
    ·Ma Lin·
    Now is the time for planting cotton, and whether or not the planting is done properly has a significant impact on cotton yield. For example, in Licheng, the highest yield can reach 90 jin of clean cotton per mu, but those without proper management only yield 7 or 8 jin of clean cotton per mu, a vast difference. To increase production, you must pay attention to the following methods:
    (1) Seed Selection—Poor seeds will not germinate after planting. Discard seeds older than three years, as well as immature, broken, or insect-damaged seeds. To ensure germination, conduct a germination test before planting. For simplicity, use the method of sprouting bean sprouts. According to the test results, if 90 or more out of 100 cotton seeds sprout, they are the best seeds; 80 or more are medium-quality seeds; and 70 or fewer are low-quality seeds. If less than 60 seeds sprout, it is best not to use them and find better cotton seeds.
    (2) Land Selection—Do not repeat the past mistake of only seeking poor land to plant cotton, especially if good land is available. If the soil is too poor, the flowers, leaves, and bolls will not grow well. Generally speaking, fertile sandy soil is most suitable for planting cotton. Black soil produces few bolls, and clay soil is not suitable for planting cotton. If you must plant in clay soil, add some sand to the planting holes.
    (3) Fertilization—In the past, many areas did not pay attention to fertilizing cotton fields, only knowing to apply more night soil. They did not know that too much night soil can cause the stems to grow poorly and delay maturity. Some, not understanding this principle, even claimed that cotton does not grow well with fertilization.
    Cotton fields must not only have sufficient base fertilizer but also mixed fertilizer. Generally, for high-quality land, apply 25 dan of farm manure, 15 jin of oil cake, and 20 jin of bone fertilizer per mu. For medium-quality land, apply 30 dan of farm manure, 35 jin of oil cake, and 30 jin of bone fertilizer per mu. For low-quality land (poor land), apply 30 dan of farm manure, 40 jin of oil cake, and 35 jin of bone fertilizer per mu. If bone fertilizer is not available, apply 30 jin of oil cake or 40 jin of rice bran. When applying rice bran, use urine to ferment it, mix it with farm manure, and then apply it. Additionally, apply 70 to 100 jin of wood ash per mu.
    Farm manure can make cotton fields fertile and loose and can increase soil temperature. Applying wood ash is for making the cotton plants strong and reducing diseases. Applying bone fertilizer is for increasing cotton bolls and promoting early maturity. However, too much wood ash and bone ash should not be applied, as this can increase the alkalinity of the cotton field soil, which is detrimental to cotton growth.
    To save fertilizer, apply bone fertilizer and oil cake deep into the ground, or apply the oil cake next to the cotton roots when the cotton seedlings are six or seven inches tall.
    (4) Sowing—Last year, many areas experienced a shortage of seedlings. This year, after Grain Rain (usually around April 20th), when sowing, the cotton field should be prepared finely and broken up, and try to use dibbling or furrow sowing methods, using a two-legged seeder to sow. For dibbling, sow six or seven seeds per hole. For furrow sowing, scatter about 20 seeds per foot. After sowing, gently press down or harrow several times to prevent ventilation.
    Cotton should not be sown too deep. If sown too deep, the cotton seeds cannot break through the soil and sprout and will only turn downward. Over time, they will rot in the soil. The appropriate sowing depth should be about one inch. In moist soil, sow shallower; in clay soil, sow shallower; in sandy soil, sow deeper, but no deeper than two inches.
    (5) Thinning Seedlings—Do not leave the seedlings too dense after germination. If they are too dense, they will not be well-ventilated and will increase the risk of diseases. Generally, for large-boll American cotton, leave a spacing of 2.5 chi (about 30 inches) wide, and for small-boll American cotton, leave a spacing of about 2 chi (about 24 inches).
    (6) Weeding—Cotton is different from other crops. The more times it is weeded, the better it grows. Generally, it should be weeded six or seven times. After rain, when the cotton field is neither dry nor wet, weed it once. When the cotton seedlings have three or four small leaves, start the first weeding. The second and third weedings can be deeper, and the fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh weedings can be shallower. Always weed more often when the seedlings are small, and after the Beginning of Autumn (around August 7th), it is not necessary to weed much.
    (7) Pruning—When the cotton seedlings grow to seven or eight inches tall, the lower "hairy ears" (early, unproductive branches) can be pruned off. After the Great Heat (around July 23rd) and before the Beginning of Autumn, start topping (removing the top of the plant). When topping, try to choose a sunny noon. Do not top or prune on rainy days. Remove the branches that only grow leaves and do not produce fruit (called "bright shoots"). Fruit branches should be retained as much as possible. Generally, branches that stretch horizontally are mostly fruit branches, while those that grow vertically upward are mostly useless "bright shoots." When pruning, also pay attention to retaining branches. For cotton to grow well, a main stem should be left in the middle.

　　为了提高产量
    种棉花，注意啥？
    ·马琳·
    现在已是种棉的时候了，但棉的种植得法与否，关系棉产量很大。如黎城最高产量每亩能收九十斤净花，但没有经过修理的，每亩却只收七、八斤净花，相差太远了。要提高产量，必须注意下面一些办法：
    （一）选种——种籽不好，种上就不出土、凡是过三年以上的陈籽，或不成熟的籽、破籽，虫伤籽要尽量拣去。为了保证出土在下种以前，要进行发芽试验。为了力求简单，可采用生豆芽方式，试验结果，一百颗棉花籽，如发在九十颗以上者为最好种，在八十颗以上者为中等籽，在七十颗以下者为下等籽，如发芽不满六十颗者，最好不要用，另找好棉籽。
    （二）找地——有好地的千万不应象过去一样，专找坏地去种棉花。土太坏，花、叶、桃都长不好。一般说，较肥的砂质土壤种棉最适宜，黑土地结桃稀少，粘土地不适于种棉，一定要种应在点窝中铺些沙子。
    （三）上粪——棉田上粪，过去很多地区都不讲究，只知道多上些圊粪就可以了，不知道圊粪上多了，就会使秆长坏、延长成熟，有不明白这个道理，反说棉花上粪长不好。
    棉田不但要上足底肥，还要上混合肥料。一般上等地，每亩要上圈肥二十五担，油饼一十五斤，骨肥二十斤；中等地每亩要上圈肥三十担，油饼三十五斤，骨肥三十斤；下等地（薄地）要上圈肥三十担，油饼四十斤，骨肥三十五斤。如果没有骨肥，可上油饼卅斤，或上米糠四十斤。上米糠时，要用尿灌入腐热，混入圈肥内去用，另外每亩再上草木灰七十斤到一百斤。
    圈肥能使棉田变肥、变松，并能提高地温。上草木灰是为了棉棵壮实，少生病害；上骨肥是为了多增棉桃，使棉花提前成熟；但草木灰和骨灰不能上的过多，过多了反会使棉田土壤碱质增加，有碍棉作生长。
    为了节省肥料，骨肥和油饼的上法尽量挖深点到地里，或在棉苗到六、七寸高以后，把油饼点到棉花根旁。
    （四）下种——去年很多地区，发生了缺苗现象；今年在谷雨后，播种时要把棉田整理细碎，尽量用点种法或溜籽种，用二条腿耧来种。点种每窝六、七颗籽，溜种每一尺远约撒二十颗籽。种后要轻轻镇压一下，或用耢多耢几次，总之不要透风。
    棉花千万不要种的太深，太深了棉籽不能破土出苗，只能转头往下长，日久霉烂土中。下种的适当深度，应在一寸左右，土湿种浅些，粘土种浅些，沙土种深些，但最深不能超过二寸深。
    （五）留苗——生苗后不要留的太稠，稠了不透风光，还能增加病害，一般的大棵美棉应留二尺半宽，小棵美棉应留二尺左右。
    （六）锄草——棉花和其他庄稼不同，锄的遍数越多，长的越好，一般要锄到六、七遍。下雨之后，棉田不干不湿时，就要锄一遍，棉苗长出三、四个小叶时，开始锄头遍，二、三遍可深些，四、五、六、七遍可浅些。总要在小苗时多锄几遍，到了立秋就不必多锄了。
    （七）打杈——，当棉苗长到七、八寸高时，就可把下部的毛耳朵打下。到大暑以后，立秋以前，就要开始去顶。去顶时尽量选择晴天的中午，不要在雨天去顶、打杈，要把不结果只长叶子的枝子去掉（有人叫明条），果枝应该多留。一般向平伸长的枝，多是果枝，纵着往上长的多是没有用处的明条。在打杈时并注意留枝，棉花要长的好，照理应留出中间一个主枝。
