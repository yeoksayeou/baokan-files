　　On "Attacks"
　　Wang Chun
　　A portion of the Jidong Guerrilla Force and militia burned down an American-supplied KMT (Kuomintang) arsenal, causing the big "second devils" to bare their fangs and claws. Anyone with a voice box started squawking. It's like they say in gambling dens: "When the duck gets a good hand, the bachelors start hollering." (For details on the attack on the American-assisted KMT arsenal in Xinhe, please see page one of this newspaper on the 18th – Editor)

　　First, let's hear what the big "first devil," U.S. Acting Secretary of State Acheson, has to say:
　　"Regarding this case, the United States does not intend to take any diplomatic steps. … This attack is not something the Chinese government can be expected to be responsible for; therefore, the Marines will take appropriate steps on the spot."

　　Judging by his tone, he seems ready for a massacre or something, just like the Japanese did with the Nakamura Incident. And what's even more wonderful is giving the so-called "Chinese government" a little pat on the back, which encourages the second devils to wave their arms, spit, and play the ugly clown, giving enthusiastic support.

　　So the second devils quickly showed off their skills. Peng Xuepei said: "The assistance the United States gives to China is for the 'legitimate' government, and Allied governments should have no objection"; a spokesperson for the Central Propaganda Department said: "The actions of the United States do not infringe on China's sovereignty in any way." And regarding this so-called "attack incident," they sent urgent telegrams everywhere in China and the United States, exaggerating it widely. In just one afternoon on the 5th, they took countless words of news. They were even more energetic than their master, the American Broadcasting Company, and others. It's such an ugly sight to see people buzzing under other people's pants.

　　The Chinese people, however, have a completely different view of this so-called "attack." From the tone of the devils, the word "attack" seems to be used as a term for a "crime," meaning a sneaky hit, so it should be punished. But that's just unnecessary legal nitpicking. In fact, "attack" is just a strike, an effective act of self-defense. What's so strange about that? The United States aids Chiang Kai-shek in the civil war, American soldiers rape Chinese female students, kill Chinese vegetable-selling old women, and kill any Chinese person at will. We have opposed such things countless times in ways that were not at all sneaky: we protested, we raised it with Marshall, we spoke to the American government, and our people even wrote letters to Truman. But what was the effect? Clearly speaking out, even if we speak out a thousand or ten thousand times, is ultimately ineffective. What do you say we should do? Should we really do as the second devil Chiang Kai-shek and his ilk advocate, that our female students should just lie down when you want to rape them, and we should just stick our necks out when you want to kill us, like what the second devil Wang Jingwei did for the Japanese when he was in Nanjing? I tell you devils, we can't! Since you blatantly supply arms to Chiang's army to slaughter the people, our guerrillas and militia have no choice but to "organize and plan" to strike. The devils think this is wrongdoing, but we feel that this is the only way to be better than lying down and being ravaged.

　　We ask Acheson and his ilk like this: If Chinese soldiers were to rape one or two of your female university students in Washington, what would you say? If we also set up a few arsenals somewhere in New York State, put up our signs outside, let your domestic Franco and his ilk live inside, and use these arms to constantly eliminate your people, what would be your opinion? Of course, you might not need to "attack"; you might be more grand and openly eliminate them. But the tactic of our guerrillas is mainly based on attacks. The difference in tactics is not a reason to constitute a crime. Could you really ask Truman to learn from Chiang Kai-shek and order you to lie down obediently and wait to die, and would you accept this order?

　　China's misfortune is only because China has second devils who invite you here, to hold your ass, send you their daughters, and call you their father. But don't mistake this for the opinion of the 450 million Chinese people. The second devils of China have their own series of ancestors, and they are not the same kind as ordinary Chinese people. Li, the wife of Shi Jingtang, Empress Dowager of Jin, wrote in her memorial to the Khitans: "The concubine Li of the Empress Dowager of the Jin Dynasty respectfully says, ... I am honored that Emperor Father has sent a letter to comfort me, ... I now send my grandsons Yan Xu and Yan Bao to present a memorial to confess their crimes." Qin Hui taught Emperor Gaozong of Song to write a memorial to the Jin people, in which he called himself "臣构" ("your subject, Gou"). Since then, China has also produced four empress dowagers, Zeng Guofan, Yuan Shikai, and Wang Jingwei, and Wang Jingwei's "documents" are still circulating in the waste paper stalls. These are the ancestors of today's second devils in China, and they have absolutely nothing to do with the general Chinese people in terms of race. They are traitors. Now the last generation of traitors is Chiang Kai-shek. Chiang the traitor used to scold Wang the traitor. It may be useful to copy a few sentences of what he said:

　　"Wang cares nothing about the life and death of the nation, the survival of the nation, the territorial sovereignty, administration, etc. What he is fighting for is the advance payment of 40 million yuan, as well as the transfer of customs deposits and consolidated taxes and salt taxes. To put it bluntly, what Wang Zhao-ming asks of the enemy is, first, money, second, money, and third, still money. With money, he can give up on everything."

　　Yes, Chiang the traitor did do better than Wang the traitor after scolding him. That is, the amount of money increased, not a mere 40 million, but 300 million, 500 million, 700 million, and so on. And with this batch of traitors, China gives foreign devils the illusion that they can swallow China by relying on traitors to pave the way. But this is a misunderstanding. The Chinese people must attack and even expel the invading thugs. The Japanese devils know this very well, because they have already experienced it.

　　I think people like Acheson are really not as insightful as the French devil Loti from fifty years ago. Fifty years ago, the French imperialist writer Loti followed the French navy to China to carry out the plundering operations of the Eight-Nation Alliance. When this writer went to Yixian to visit the Qing imperial tombs, Li Hongzhang and others had already submitted letters of surrender to Waldersee, so this gentleman was greatly flattered and welcomed by the prefectures and counties along the way. In Laiyuan and Yixian, he also saw young martial arts competitions forced to be performed for the enemy. So he was taken aback and quickly wrote down his worries, telling the Western devils:

　　"This country, which is still able to burst out with frightening strength, will it not wake up from its thousand-year-old dream, will it not take up arms to seek some kind of revenge? My God! If there is such a day, if China organizes and trains millions of young people, those strong, simple, martial arts-skilled, and proud young people who do not know fear that I saw at the entertainment meetings in Laiyuan and Yixian, and then take up modern weapons, what a terrible army this would be! Using this army to plot the supreme resistance, what unimaginable revenge this would be for us! If you think about the seeds of hatred that our Allied forces have crudely planted here, and all the reasons for revenge, this is very possible!"

　　Let's not talk about whether to "revenge" or not. But this man, though dead for decades, is far more insightful than today's Acheson and others. He knew that there were "all the reasons for revenge" and that they themselves had "planted the seeds of hatred"; then, even "the supreme resistance" should be "plotted," as long as we continue to be oppressed and cannot live. "Attacks" are just a small part of it. He also knew that organizing and training the young people he saw, and taking up modern weapons, would be a "terrible army," so he shouted, "My God!" And what he estimated as "possible" is probably today's reality. It's no longer "if there is such a day." Are Acheson and his ilk blind? Please also reflect on all the reasons why you have to be attacked and all the seeds of hatred you have sown; please also look at the millions of strong, simple, martial arts-skilled, and proud young people we have organized and trained like Loti. These are the Chinese people, these are the people of China. The Chiang Kai-shek and his ilk, whom your Donaldson and others praise for their "gentle and polite manners, like a poet or scholar," actually have no connection with the Chinese people. You are just blind yourself, stubbornly treating them as the general type of Chinese, so you will inevitably suffer attacks, or even incur "the supreme resistance." Because you have not yet figured out what kind of person is the real Chinese person.

　　关于“袭击”
    王春
    冀东游击队及民兵一部把美牌蒋用的军火库烧了，这就弄得大二毛子们都张牙舞爪；凡是身上长得有发声器的，都喳喳叫唤。真象赌博场中所说的：“鸭子和一牌，光棍嚷起来”。（袭击新河美助蒋内战军火库事请参看十八日本报一版——编者）
    先听大毛子美代理国务卿艾契逊是怎么说：
    “关于此案，美国不拟采取任何外交步骤。………………此一袭击案，不能期望中国政府负责；故陆战队将就地自行采取适当之步骤。”
    看口气，似乎还准备来一番大屠杀之类，好象当年日本人关于中村事件所做的那样。而更妙的是把所谓“中国政府”顺便照拂一笔，这就给了二毛子以挥胳膊，喷唾沫，大做捧场丑角的鼓励。
    于是乎二毛子赶紧献技了，彭学沛说：“美国予中国之援助，乃对于‘合法’这政府，盟邦政府应无可非议”；什么中宣部发言人则说：“美国之行动，毫无侵害中国主权之处”。而对于这所谓“袭击事件”，他们则在中美各地都大发急电，广为夸张，光五日一个下午，就拍了不知多少字的消息；做得比其主人美国广播公司等，实还起劲得多。钻在人家裤裆底下嗡嗡叫的人，其丑态如此。
    对于这所谓“袭击”，中国人民的看法，却完全不同。象“袭击”这个字眼，从毛子们的口气看来，大约是用作一种“罪行”的语词，意即暗暗打了一下，故应该惩办云；然而这其实是多余的深文周纳。其实，“袭击”就是打击，就是有效的自卫之举，有何足怪？美国援蒋内战，美国兵奸淫中国女学生，杀中国卖菜老婆婆，随便杀中国不管什么人；这种事，我们曾经用并非暗暗打一下的办法无数次反对过：我们抗议，我们向马歇尔提出，我们给美国政府讲，我们人民也曾写信给杜鲁门；但是效果在哪里？明明讲一下，乃至明明讲过一千下一万下，终归无效；你说怎么办？真个就如二毛子蒋介石之流所主张的，你们要奸淫，我们的女学生就躺下，你们要杀人，我们就伸脖子，如同汪二毛子坐南京时候给日本人所做的那样吗？实告毛子们说，不能！你们既明目张胆的供应军火给蒋军屠杀人民，惹得我们游击队和民兵不得不“有组织有计划的”来打一下。毛子们认为这是非状，我们却觉着也只有这个办法，才比躺下受糟踏强。
    我们象这样问艾契逊之流：假如中国的军队，在华盛顿把你们的女大学生奸淫一两个，你们会怎么说呢？假如我们也弄几个军火库，放到纽约州的什么地方，外面挂上我们的招牌，内里住上你们国内的佛朗哥之流，拿上这批军火不断去消灭你们的人民，那你们的意见又怎样呢？当然，你们或许用不到“袭击”，你们可能是更气派大一些，公开予以消灭。但是我们的游击队的战法就是以袭击为主，战法之不同，实在没有据以构成罪状的道理呀！难道你们果真能叫杜鲁门也向蒋介石学习，命令你们服服贴贴躺下听死，而且你们也就肯接受这个命令吗？
    中国的不幸，仅只是因为中国出了二毛子，请你们来，替你们掇屁股、送闺女，叫你当他的爸爸；这却千万不要误会为就是中国四五万万人的意见。中国的二毛子，是有他另外一系列祖先的，和一般中国人，并非是一类，石敬塘的老婆李太后写给契丹的表章是这么措词：“晋室皇太后媳妇李氏妾言，………伏蒙皇帝阿翁降书安抚者，……今遣孙男延煦延宝奉表请罪”。秦桧教宋高宗给金人写的表章，则要自称“臣构”。自此以下，中国还出过四太后，出过曾国藩、出过袁世凯、汪精卫，而汪精卫那些“文告”，现今卖废纸的摊子上就还流行的有。这就是今天中国二毛子另成一系列的祖先，这和一般中国人民，绝对谈不上什么种族关系，这是汉奸。现在末代的汉奸是蒋介石，蒋汉奸从前骂过汪汉奸，这也不妨抄几句，看他说的什么：
    “汪逆对于国家民族生死存亡的领土主权行政等等，他一切都可以不管；而所争者，乃是四千万元款项之预支，以及关税之存款与统税盐税之转移。明白的说，汪兆铭向敌人所要求的，第一是钱，第二是钱，第三还是钱。有了钱，就可以一概不争。”
    是的，蒋汉奸骂过汪汉奸之后，做得确比汪汉奸更高明一些，那就是钱数增多了，不是区区四千万，而是三万万、五万万、七万万等等。而中国有了这批汉奸，所以就会给外国毛子们以错觉，以为靠汉奸开路，大约就可以平吞中国。然而这是误会，中国人民对于侵略暴徒，是必须袭击以至于驱逐的，日本鬼子就很知道这回事，因为他已经验过了。
    我觉着艾契逊等辈，实在还不如五十年前的法国毛子洛谛还略具眼光。五十年前，法国的帝国主义文人洛谛，跟着法国海军到中国来做那次八国联军之役的屠掠行动。当这位文人要去易县参观清皇陵的时候，已经是李鸿章等人向瓦德西他们递过降书顺表的时期了，所以此君一路行来，大受沿途州县绅衿的谄媚欢迎。在来诸、易县，他还看到了被强迫拉来给敌人表演的青年武术竞技。于是他吃了一惊，赶紧写下他的忧虑来，告诉西方毛子们说：
    “这犹然能够迸发怕人的强力的国度，它不会从它的千年老梦里惊醒起来，它不会拿起兵器来图或种的报复吗？我的天！假如有这么一天，中国把国内的百万青年，把象我在来诸、易州的游艺会上所看见的那些壮健朴实武艺精强而傲岸不知畏死的青年，组织训练起来；再拿上近代的武器，这是怎样可怕的军队！用了这种军队来图谋最上的反抗，这又是怎样为我们所不敢想象的报复！假使想一想我们联军在这里粗卤的种下的仇恨种子，和一切不得不报复的理由，这真便是很有可能的事呀！”
    “报复”不报复，姑且不谈。但这人虽已死过几十年，其眼力实在是比今之艾契逊等等高出多多的。他知道有“一切不得不报复的理由”，有他们自己“种下的仇恨种子”；那么，就连“最上的反抗”，也是应该“图谋”的了，只要还继续欺压，叫我们不能活的话。“袭击”，盖其小焉者也。他也知道把他所看见的青年组织训练起来，拿上近代的武器，是“可怕的军队”，所以他大叫“我的天！”而他所估计到的“可能”，大约就是今天的现实了，已经不是什么“假如有这么一天”。艾契逊之流竟是瞎子吗？请你们也反省一下那些一切不得不袭击的理由和你们种下的一切仇恨的种子；请你们也象洛谛一样，看了我们组织训练起来的百万壮健朴实武艺精强而傲岸不知畏死的青年，这才是中国人，才是中国的人民。象你们的唐纳逊之流所夸奖的“态度温柔多礼、犹如一诗人或学者”的蒋介石等辈，其实和中国人民没有一点连系，那只是你们自己做了瞎子，硬把他们当成中国人的一般类型，所以卒不免于遭受袭击，或竟招致“最上的反抗”，也说不定。因为什么样的人才是真正的中国人，你们现在是还没有弄清楚的。
