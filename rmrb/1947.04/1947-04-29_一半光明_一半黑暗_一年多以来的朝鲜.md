Half Light, Half Darkness
North Korea Over the Past Year

The 1943 Cairo Conference guaranteed Korea's freedom and independence "in due course." The Soviet Union agreed to this guarantee and agreed to occupy northern Korea while US forces occupied southern Korea to destroy Japanese rule in Korea. Thus, after Japan surrendered, Soviet troops liberated northern Korea, and US troops landed in southern Korea. Since then, the 38th parallel has become the dividing line, and the northern and southern parts of Korea have become two completely different worlds. In the north, the Soviet army brought freedom, democracy, and light to the Korean people; in the south, the US army brought suffocation, terror, and darkness to the Korean people.

During the Anti-Japanese War, the Korean Communist Party, the Radical Democratic Party, the National Revolutionary Party, the Youth League, and others organized underground people's fronts, leading the Korean people in arduous struggles against the Japanese invaders. After Japan surrendered, they immediately formed local committees, with Liu Gongxun (leader of the Radical Democratic Party) as chairman, and on August 31 of that year, mass meetings were held in 145 towns to elect people's committees to manage government affairs. On September 6, a national congress was held in Seoul, attended by 600 representatives from various provinces, which established the Central People's Committee and the Constitution Drafting Committee, declaring Korea a temporary People's Republic and demanding the immediate declaration of Korean independence. Its main platform included: guaranteeing the confiscation of all Japanese land in Korea and distributing it to actual farmers; requisitioning Japanese and Korean "collaborators" (Koreans who had been running dogs for Japanese imperialism) to run industrial mines and public utilities, and nationalizing them; supporting small-scale private enterprises; guaranteeing people's freedom; gender equality; an eight-hour work system... etc. The Communist Party, People's Party, Youth League, Women's League, Farmers' Association, Labor League, Chamber of Commerce Federation, and other political parties and organizations all supported this platform, representing nearly six million people.

The commander of the US occupation forces in Korea was originally General Stilwell, but later, because Chiang Kai-shek was unhappy with this "friend of the East Asian people," he whined to his American master, hoping to keep Stilwell out of the Asian continent; the American reactionaries were naturally happy to do so, and temporarily decided that the reactionary Hodge would lead the US 24th Corps of 50,000 troops into Korea. After Hodge's army entered Korea, the most important thing to him was not the work of clearing out Japanese forces. He simply ordered the Japanese army to "voluntarily" disarm, concentrate and wait to be repatriated, and that was it; immediately afterwards, he turned his bayonet at the growing revolutionary forces in Korea.

Before the US troops arrived, the Japanese had already contacted the local committees led by the leaders of the Korean underground revolutionary work to negotiate surrender. However, when General Hodge's headquarters planted the Stars and Stripes flag in Seoul, he simply did not see the Korean people, but established a military government, directly accepted the surrender, and ignored the Central People's Committee of the People's Republic of Korea.

During the war, the United States had already cultivated a Korean reactionary, Syngman Rhee, and the Chiang Kai-shek government accommodated Kim Gu and others, who were in the same league as Syngman Rhee. After Hodge occupied southern Korea, he summoned Kim Gu, Syngman Rhee, and others back to Korea and placed them in beautiful, heavily guarded palaces.

Syngman Rhee and Kim Gu and their ilk, stood under Hodge's crotch, relying on the support of the American reactionaries, and were in opposition to the so-called "Provisional Government faction" (Kim Gu and others had established a pitifully small government-in-exile in Chongqing - the "Korean Provisional Government") and the "People's Republic faction." They gained the support of a small number of big merchants, landlords, and comprador bourgeoisie through the "Nationalist Party" and the "Democratic Party." The "advisory committee" appointed by Hodge was entirely composed of these people. The US-occupied zone military government did whatever it wanted with their help. They represented the interests of American imperialism and the feudal forces of Korea, suppressed democratic activities, arrested democrats, and exploited and even slaughtered the Korean people. Enemy property was taken over by the US military for "safe keeping" or handed over to Korean big merchants to operate; the Japanese land still maintained the original tenancy system, but the people collecting rent were changed from Japanese to Americans; the Korean big landlords also continued to collect more than 60% of the rent. Korean traitors who had served as officials under Japanese rule were allowed to run newspapers and were encouraged to continue political activities, and some were even "honored" as members of the advisory committee of the US Military Governor General Arnold. Not only was land reform not implemented, but after the land reform in the north, many landlords fled to the south to be sheltered by the US military. US Military Governor General Arnold even announced: "Japanese can enjoy various freedoms and rights without restrictions and without discrimination." Japanese private property was not confiscated. Large numbers of workers were unemployed or could only get wages and salaries that were not enough to maintain life, and the peasants were increasingly impoverished and hungry. People's freedom of assembly, speech, etc. was wantonly deprived. ...

In the Soviet-occupied zone of northern Korea, the Soviet army did not set up a military government, but encouraged Korean autonomy, and the Soviet authorities only retained the highest guidance power. All Japanese officials and Korean "dignitaries" who had held important positions under Japanese rule were completely cleared out. The broad masses supported the People's Republic. The North Korean People's Committee, elected by universal suffrage, was officially established in February 1946, with Communist leader Kim Il-sung as chairman. In May, it was formally established as the government, holding administrative power. Under his leadership, land reform was vigorously carried out, feudal remnants were eliminated, and 725,000 landless or land-poor peasants obtained more than 1 million hectares of land. Japanese land was completely distributed to poor peasants, and rent was reduced for middle and small landlords, so that tenants could get 70% of the harvest. (Before the war, they could only get 40%, 50%, or even only 10%.) Japanese industry was also completely confiscated and put into operation under the management of workers. After the Japanese invaders and feudal forces were completely eliminated, the people gained true freedom and liberation.

The Moscow Conference of Foreign Ministers in December 1945 determined the policy of democratizing Korea. It was decided that the US and Soviet occupation forces headquarters would organize a joint committee to assist Korean democratic parties in forming a temporary democratic government and promote its political, economic, and social progress. It was also decided that the four countries of the Soviet Union, Britain, the United States, and China would establish a five-year trusteeship in Korea. On March 20 last year, the US-Soviet Joint Committee was officially established and started work. However, due to the obstruction of the US side, the work of the Joint Committee was forced to stop. On February 28 this year, the Soviet commander sent a letter to the US commander, advocating opening the deadlock and resuming the work of the Joint Committee, but the US authorities ignored it.

The wish of the American reactionaries is to raise the remnants of Japanese fascism and Korean reactionaries as their pawns to rule Korea, and to make Korea their colony and military base forever. An American officer told American reporter Snow: "Korea is now part of the new American border, where we are holding the eastern wing of the Soviet front." In fact, only half of this sentence is correct, and the other half is deceiving; they want to suck the blood of the Korean people under the smokescreen of "anti-Soviet." Korea is a piece of fat, with 28 million people and 85,000 square miles of land, with modern cities and seaports, and railways and highways crisscrossing the peninsula, and the degree of industrialization is quite high. Moreover, it was not damaged at all in the war. The American imperialists have long coveted this piece of fat. Now that they have swallowed half of it, they are unwilling to let go.

But the Korean people will never allow the American reactionaries to devour them. The US military conducted secret ballot direct elections in three counties, and as a result, the candidates of the People's Republic faction won a complete victory. It is estimated that as long as such anonymous universal suffrage is implemented, the People's Republic faction can win in any place. The majority of the Korean people are tenants who have lost their land. Before the war, 38% of the peasants had only 1.25 acres of land per person, and 3% of Korean landlords and Japanese occupied 64% of the country's land. Tenants accounted for 51% of the total population, and they had no land at all. What they support must be people who advocate freeing them from their bondage and allowing them to acquire land. In southern Korea, peasant uprisings and strikes are surging forward one after another; they will eventually be able to achieve independence and freedom with their own strength. The American reactionaries who are obsessed with military expansion will ultimately be unable to get what they want. (Yan Ling)

　　一半光明·一半黑暗
    一年多以来的朝鲜
    一九四三年开罗会议保证朝鲜“于适当时间内”恢复自由，成为独立国家。苏联同意这一保证，并同意占领朝鲜北部而由美军占领南部以摧毁日本在朝鲜的统治。于是，日本投降后，苏军解放了朝鲜北部，美军登陆朝鲜南部。从此，以北线三十八度为界，朝鲜南北两部成为两个截然不同的天地。在北部，苏军带给朝鲜人民的是自由、民主、光明；在南部，美军带给朝鲜人民的是窒息、恐怖、黑暗。
        ×                      ×                      ×
    在抗日战争时期，朝鲜共产党，急进民主党以及民族革命党，青年协会等，曾组织地下的人民阵线，领导朝鲜人民对日寇作艰苦的斗争。日本投降后，他们立即成立地方委员会，由刘拱勋（急进民主党领袖）任主席，并于当年八月三十一日在一百四十五个城镇内群众集会选出人民委员会；管理政务。九月六日在汉城召开全国代表大会，到各省代表六百人，成立了中央人民委员会和宪法起草委员会，宣布朝鲜为一个临时人民共和国，要求立即宣布朝鲜独立。它的政纲主要的有：保证收没一切日本人在朝鲜的土地分给实际生产的农民；征用日本人朝鲜“合作分子”（曾做过日本帝国主义者的走狗的朝鲜人）办的工矿及公用事业，收归国有；扶助小规模私营企业；保证人民自由；男女平等；八小时工作制……等等。共产党、人民党、青年协会、妇女联盟、农民协会、劳工联盟、商会联合会等政党及团体都支持这个政纲，他们代表的群众近六百万人。
    朝鲜美占领军统帅原定为史迪威将军，后来由于蒋介石不乐意这位“东亚人民之友”，向他美国主子撒了一下娇，希望把史迪威摒在亚洲大陆以外；美国反动派自然也乐意这样做，就临时又决定由反动的霍奇带领美军第二十四军团五万人开入朝鲜。霍奇的大军进入朝鲜之后，最关心的不是清除日本势力的工作，他只命令日军“自行”缴械，集中待轮返国，就算完事；紧接着他就把刺刀尖对准了正在增大的朝鲜的革命势力。
    在美军还没开到以前，日本人已向朝鲜地下革命工作领袖们领导组成的地方委员会接洽投降。然而，当霍奇将军的总部在汉城插上星点红条旗的时候，他眼睛里根本没有看到朝鲜人民，而设立了军政府，直接受降，没有理会朝鲜人民共和国中央人民委员会。
        ×                    ×                    ×
    在大战时期，美国就预先豢养好了一个朝鲜的反动分子李承晚，并由蒋介石政府收容了和李承晚是一邱之貉的金九等。霍奇占领朝鲜南部之后，就把金九、李承晚等唤回朝鲜，把他们放在漂亮的警卫森严的皇宫里。
    李承晚和金九之流，站在霍奇的胯下，依赖美国反动派的支持，以所谓“临时政府派”（金九等曾在重庆设立过一个小得可怜的流亡政府——“韩国临时政府”）和“人民共和国派”处于对立的地位。他们通过“国民党”“民主党”，取得少数大商人、地主、买办资产阶级的拥护。霍奇指派的“顾问委员会”中清一色是这些人。美占区军政府在他们帮凶之下为所欲为。他们代表着美帝国主义和朝鲜的封建势力的利益，压制民主活动，逮捕民主分子，剥削甚至屠杀朝鲜人民。敌产由美军劫收后“代为保管”或交朝鲜大商人经营；日本人的土地仍保持着原来的租佃制度，只不过收租的人由日本人变成了美国人；朝鲜的大地主们，也仍继续收百分之六十以上的租子。在日本统治下做过官的韩奸被允许办报，被鼓励着仍作政治活动，甚至有的“荣任”为美国军事总监亚诺特的顾问委员会委员。不仅不实行土地改革，而且北部土地改革后，很多地主都逃避到南部受美军的庇护。美军事总监亚诺特甚至宣布：“日本人能毫无限制并不受歧视的享受各种自由权利。”对日本人的私产不予没收。大量的职工失业或只能得到不足维持生活的工资、薪金，农民们日益贫困饥饿。人民的集会、言论等自由横遭剥夺。……

    在朝鲜北部苏联占领区，苏军没有设军政府，而鼓励韩人自治，苏军当局只保有最高指导权。所有的日本官员以及在日本统治下任过要职的朝鲜“权贵”是被彻底清除了。广大的群众拥护人民共和国。普选产生的朝鲜北部人民委员会于一九四六年二月正式成立，共产党领袖金贻荪任主席，五月，并正式成立为政府，掌握行政权。在他的领导下，大力进行了土地改革，消灭封建残余，七十二万五千无地或少地的农民获得了土地一百余万公顷。日本人的土地完成分配给贫苦的农民，中小地主的土地实行减租，使佃农能得到收获量百分之七十。（战前只能得到百分之四十、五十甚至只有百分之十。）日本人的工业也完全被收没，由工人管理开工。日寇势力和封建势力完全被肃清之后，人民获得了真正的自由解放。
    一九四五年十二月莫斯科三外长会议，确定了使朝鲜走向民主化的方针。决定由美苏占领军司令部组织联合委员会，以协助朝鲜各民主党派组成临时民主政府，并促进其政治、经济、社会的进步。并决定由苏、英、美、中四国在朝鲜建立为期五年的托管。去年三月二十日苏美联合委员会正式成立开始工作。但由于美方的掣肘，联合委员会的工作被迫停止。今年二月二十八日，苏军司令给美军司令一封信，主张打开僵局，恢复联合委员会的工作，可是美军当局意然置之不理。
    美国反动派的愿望是豢养着日本法西斯残余和朝鲜反动分子作为他们统治朝鲜的爪牙，把朝鲜永远作为他们的殖民地、军事基地。一个美国军官对美记者史诺说过：“朝鲜现在是美国新疆界的一部分，这里我们顶住苏联战线的东翼。”实际上，这句话只有一半是对的，一半却是骗人的；他们是想在“反苏”的烟幕下吸干朝鲜人民的血。朝鲜是一块肥肉，拥有二千八百万人民，八万五千方英里的土地，有现代化的都市和海港，铁路公路密布整个半岛，工业化的程度相当高。而且，在大战中没有受到一点损害。美国帝国主义者对这块肥肉，早望得垂涎三尺了。现在既已吞下一半，就不肯放松。
    ×                      ×                            ×
    可是朝鲜人民是决不肯任凭美国反动派吞噬的。美军曾在三县试行秘密投票的直接选举，结果是人民共和国派的候选人大获全胜。据估计，只要实行这样不记名的普选，人民共和国派在任何一地都可获得胜利。朝鲜人民大多数是失去了土地的佃农。在战前，百分之三十八的农民每人只有土地一又四分之一英亩，占全人口百分之三的朝鲜地主和日本人占有全国土地百分之六十四。佃农占全人口百分之五十一，他们根本没有土地。他们所拥护的，一定是主张解除他们的束缚使他们获得土地的人。在朝鲜南部，农民暴动，蜂起云涌，罢工浪潮前仆后继；他们终必能用自己的力量取得独立自由。醉心军事扩张的美国反动派终于是难以如愿以偿的。（雁翎）
