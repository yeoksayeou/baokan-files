    [Xinhua News Agency, Jinji-Luyu, 22nd] The guerrilla forces and militia in the entire Taiyue area, from Pingyao and Jiexiu in the north to Jiyuan and Mengxian, a distance of 1,000 li, cooperated with the main forces in combat along the border, annihilating more than 1,000 Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan troops in half a month. The Taiyue Military Region Headquarters recently announced the results of the first half of this month: A total of 193 battles, large and small, were fought; 1,195 enemy soldiers, including regimental commanders and deputy commanders, were killed, wounded, or captured; 22 various machine guns, 2 small cannons, 11 grenade launchers, 302 long and short guns, 9,073 rounds of ammunition, 10 million yuan of Chiang's currency, 130 bags of foreign flour, and 10 mules and horses were captured; 1 train was burned, 1 train was overturned, 1 locomotive was destroyed, 45 li of railway was destroyed, 5 bridges were blown up, and 2,630 jin of electric wire were cut.
    [This newspaper, Taiyue, 23rd] Militia in Yuanqu, Jiyuan, Mengxian, Linfen, Xiangling, An(yi) and Xia(xian) and other places, cooperated with the main forces in launching attacks, unfolding a killing enemy competition. Zhao Yuanxi, the anti-"counter-reckoning" hero of the second district of Yuanqu, although covered with scabies, also actively operated behind Chiang's lines under the call to defend Chairman Mao and cooperate with the main forces in southern Shanxi, killing and capturing a total of 6 enemies in two days, the 27th and 28th of last month. The armed work team led by Li Dielin, a first-class combat hero of Yuanqu, cooperated with the Yangcheng expedition team on the 23rd to repel Chiang's stubborn troops who were looting grain in Songcun, killing and wounding 10 enemies below the company commander level. Mengxian militia heroes Wei Tongye, Song Zuomin, and the militia team led by Niu Dechang of the third district used the "fierce tiger pouncing on sheep" tactic to penetrate dozens of miles behind enemy lines on the night of the 4th, killing two enemies in the village of Xiangjiang and capturing two guns. The militia of the sixth district of Jiyuan killed two enemies and wounded six on Wuling on the 5th of this month, and captured one rifle. On the eve of the Yicheng battle (3rd), the Linfen and Xiangling guerrillas carried out a major sabotage between Jia Village Station, destroying two li of railway in one hour, and carrying back 42 rails and more than 200 sleepers. The Xiangling armed work team went deep into the south of the city, and in the areas of Liuzhuang and Dongzhu, captured three soldiers of the enemy's 13th Security Regiment without firing a shot. On the 6th, the Xiangling County Brigade went deep into Fencheng and jointly attacked the Chiang-puppet Baojing team in Xi-Xiliang, annihilating all the enemies at the cost of one lightly wounded soldier. Fifty-five enemies were killed or captured, and two machine guns and forty-six rifles were seized. The An(yi) and Xia(xian) Flying Group destroyed an enemy car in Sanjia Village, east of Anyi, on the 11th, and seized 130 bags of foreign flour and two hand-held guns, consuming only three bullets.
