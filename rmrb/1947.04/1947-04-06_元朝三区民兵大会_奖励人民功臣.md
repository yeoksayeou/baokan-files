　　Yuan Dynasty Three District Militia Congress
  　Rewards People's Heroes
    [Report from Jinnan by our newspaper on the 3rd] The merit campaign in Yuan Dynasty and Wei County has penetrated deeply into the rural areas. On March 9th, the Yuan Dynasty Third District held a congress of over a thousand militia members in Wangfengji, electing and rewarding people's heroes and commending role models for their meritorious service. Yin Shuangxing, while defending the Wei River at the Dragon King Temple, completed the task of dismantling enemy blockhouses under enemy fire. Shi Luoting not only did a good job in his own village during the joint defense and curfew but also went out to neighboring villages to achieve results. Zhang Yiju is a recognized enemy-killing hero among the militia. He is always brave and calm during battles; the louder the guns, the more energetic he becomes. Shang Fatian went on an expedition to Jinxiang and completed the communication task amidst the intense artillery fire of the Chiang army. Minister Yin of the Armed Forces Committee and District Chief Zhang presented flowers and wine to the above-mentioned meritorious militia members and awarded each of them a certificate of merit, a towel, and four hand grenades. Finally, Minister Yin encouraged everyone, saying, "Militia members who have made contributions should not be proud and should continue to make contributions; militia members who have not made contributions should not be discouraged and should work actively to serve the people more. Strive for future contributions." In the organizational rectification of Guojiazhuang in Wei County, in order to further promote democracy and improve the enthusiasm of all members, under the spirit of "rewards for the meritorious," each group held heated discussions and commended role models. Criteria for role models: 1. Arrive early for meetings and speak frequently. 2. The whole family attends meetings, and the whole family is united. 3. Handle affairs democratically, selflessly, and impartially. 4. Not afraid of offending landlords, and not providing cover for landlords. 5. Active in doing things and taking the lead. Those who meet all five of the above criteria are considered first-class role models. All members carefully measured each member against the criteria for role models and voted by bean ballot. Guo Qingfu and Jia Jianshi won the title of first-class role models and were supported and loved by the masses.
