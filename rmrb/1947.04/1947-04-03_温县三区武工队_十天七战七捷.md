　　Wen County Third District Armed Work Team
    Ten Days, Seven Battles, Seven Victories
    [Our Newspaper] In response to the higher-level call to prepare for a counter-offensive, the Wen County Third District Armed Work Brigade has launched guerrilla warfare throughout the county, achieving great success in seven activities over the past ten days. The first time they struck into the second district of Wen County, capturing two local despots in Xue Zhao Village. The second time they struck east of Wen County, engaging in a fierce battle with the enemy's Self-Defense Corps at Lao Cui Village for more than twenty minutes, routing the enemy. The third time was at Xi Huaifeng, where the enemy sent several "township offices" to "encircle and suppress" us, but our army immediately defeated them all. The fourth time, the enemy in Wen County city gathered more than two hundred people to attack Dongxi Zhou Village, but they were completely driven back by us, and we pursued them to Dongnan Wang on the edge of Wen County city (one or two li from the city). The fifth time, our Third District Armed Work Team, in coordination with Unit ××, took the initiative to attack the Huanghe Tan military area, conducting political offensives everywhere, posting slogans, and distributing leaflets, which greatly boosted the morale of the masses. They all said, "We have been waiting for you to come every day, but you haven't come. Now that you're here, you must not leave." The sixth time, our Third District Armed Work Team, in coordination with Detachment ××, operated in the Zhao Bao area, conducting political offensives. Upon arriving at Bei Mengfeng Village, they discovered more than thirty enemies, armed with a machine gun. At that time, our armed work team members were in high spirits. As soon as the machine gun fired, our armed work team and Unit ×× rushed forward fiercely, scattering the enemy in disarray. We captured two horses and a bicycle. The seventh time, our armed work team attacked the Zhao Bao Pinggao area of the Third District to conduct political offensives and planted three landmines, one at the Pinggao enemy Bao Office and two at the Zhao Bao Town Office (District Office). All have exploded, and the effect is pending investigation.
    After these seven activities, the combat skills and confidence in victory of our armed work team members have greatly improved; the people are also overjoyed, saying one after another: From now on, it will be the poor people's world again.

    十天七战七捷
    【本报讯】为响应上级号召准备反攻，温县三区武工大队已在该县到处展开了游击战，十天以来活动七次，都有很大的成绩。第一次打到温县二区，在薛肇村捉恶霸二名。第二次打到温县城东，在老催庄和敌自卫团激战二十余分钟，将敌击溃。第三次在西滑封，敌人摧来若干“乡公所”来“围剿”，我军当即将敌全部击溃。第四次，温县城内敌人集结二百余人犯东西周村，又被我全部打回去，并追到温县城边的东南王（距城一二里）。第五次我三区武工队配合××部主动出击到黄河滩军地一带到处活动进行政治攻势，贴标语，散传单，群众情绪万分高涨。他们都说：“俺们每天盼你们来，但一直不来，这一下可盼来了，千万不能走。”第六次我三区武工队配合××支队到赵堡一带活动，进行政攻，一到北孟封村便发觉了敌人有卅余人，带有机枪一挺，当时我武工队员情绪十分高涨，机枪一射，我武工队与××部猛烈冲到前边去，将敌人追了个一塌糊涂，东逃西散。我缴获马两匹，自行车一辆。第七次我武工队出击到三区赵堡平皋一带进行政攻，并下了三个地雷，一个是在平皋敌人保公所，两个是在赵堡镇公所（区公所）。都已爆炸，效果待查。
    经过这七次活动，我武工队员作战技术和胜利信心大大的提高；老百姓也是欢天喜地的，纷纷说：这以后又是穷人天下了。
