Xinhua News Agency, West Manchuria, 19th: The masses in Qianjinshan Village, Qidong County, Heilongjiang Province, have begun their first plowing and sowing, with wheat and flax seeds being sown successively. At 1:00 PM on the 8th, the Duan Haiyao production team of the village was the first to go to the fields with plows and rollers. To celebrate their first plowing and the victory of this year's production, the team set off firecrackers during the plowing and congratulated each other. The leader sang a joyful song: "Eat eggs, bury eggs; one hectare of land, yield nine stones." The village has 720 hectares of land, and plans to plant 30 hectares of wheat this year. All 20 sharecropping teams in the village are currently busy delivering manure. Among them, the Duan Haiyao, Jia Jingchun, and other five teams have already delivered all 560 cartloads of manure to the fields. The 30 hectares of wheat will be sown in the coming days. Influenced by the unprecedented production enthusiasm, the working women in the village have also begun to organize. The daughters-in-law of Zhao En, Duan Yugong, and Zhang Shihua were the first to organize a mutual aid production team. Duan Yugong's daughter-in-law guarantees that all the work at home will not require the men's attention. She is responsible for fetching water for all three families. Zhao and Zhang shake the windlass. The three of them also jointly cut the grass for the four horses of the three families. Encouraged by them, the daughters-in-law of Li Shicheng and other three families have also successively established mutual aid teams.
