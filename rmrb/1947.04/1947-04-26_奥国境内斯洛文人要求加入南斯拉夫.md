　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th: TASS Vienna reports: A Pravda reporter reporting on Carinthia stated that of Carinthia's 180,000 population, 120,000 are Slovenians. This area has been the only place within Austria with armed resistance against the Hitler bandits since 1942. Ninety percent of the guerrillas were Slovenians. Austrian government leader and current President Renner had assured the Slovenians that he would strive to meet the economic and cultural demands of the Slovenians, and that the issue of their merger with Slovenian Yugoslavia would be resolved at a later conference. However, the Carinthian local government, led by the Austrian government and the Socialist Party, has consistently followed the policies of their ancestor Hitler, opposing the Slovenian people's idea of national self-determination, and instigating and protecting fascist elements to launch attacks on Slovenians everywhere. The Austrian government authorities also refused the Slovenians' demand to establish a national political party. The Slovenian Liberation Front is the only reputable organization in Austria that has resisted fascism with armed force, but it has not yet been recognized by the British occupation authorities. However, under the leadership of the Liberation Front, the vast Slovenian farmers of Carinthia, and even most Slovenian priests, have participated in the great movement demanding national self-determination and merger with Slovenian Yugoslavia. Furthermore, according to Belgrade: The ban on Slovenian gatherings by the British occupation authorities in Austria has aroused a huge wave of protests from the people of Carinthia. Large-scale rallies have been held in various parts of Carinthia, passing resolutions protesting the decrees of the British and Austrian authorities, and sending them to the Allied Council in Austria. Various places also sent resolutions and letters to the Council of Foreign Ministers, demanding to join Yugoslavia. At the same time, mass rallies and demonstrations have been held in various parts of the People's Republic of Slovenia, Yugoslavia, to warmly support the reasonable demands of their brothers of the same blood.

　　奥国境内斯洛文人要求加入南斯拉夫
    【新华社陕北廿日电】塔斯社维也纳讯：真理报访员报导卡伦地亚的情况称：卡伦地亚十八万人口中有十二万是斯洛文人，该地从一九四二年起即是奥国境内唯一有武装反抗希特勒匪徒的地方，在游击队中百分之九十都是斯洛文人。奥国政府领袖现任总统雷弗尔曾向斯洛文人保证：将努力满足斯洛文人的经济和文化的要求，并且彼等与南斯拉夫斯洛文尼亚合并的问题会在以后和会上得到解决。但是奥政府和社会党所领导的卡伦地亚地方政府却始终追随着他们老祖宗希特勒的政策，反对斯洛文人的民族自决思想，并怂恿袒护法西斯分子在各地发动进击斯洛文人。奥政府当局还拒绝斯洛文人成立民族政党的要求，斯洛文尼亚解放阵线是奥地利唯一以武装反抗法西斯主义有威望的组织，但迄今仍未得英占领当局承认。但是在解放阵线的发动下，卡伦地亚广大的斯洛文农民以至大多数斯洛文神父，都参加了要求民族自决和与南斯拉夫斯洛文人合并的伟大运动。又据贝尔格莱德讯：在奥国的英占领当局对斯洛文人集会的禁令，已激起卡伦地亚人民巨大的抗议的浪潮。卡伦地亚各地纷纷举行大会，通过抗议英、奥当局法令的决议，送达在奥国的盟国委员会。各地并以决议和函件送交外长会议，要求加入南斯拉夫。同时，南斯拉夫斯洛文尼亚人民共和国各地亦纷纷举行群众大会及示威运动，热烈支援他们同血族弟兄的这一合理要求。
