　　Introduction to Spring Plowing Loan Experiences
　　Office of the Border Region Government, Hao Liaofu
　　Currently, various regions are carrying out spring plowing loans to solve production difficulties. Now, based on some local experiences, I offer a few points for your reference.

　　I. How to solve ideological problems of village cadres and the masses: Some village cadres, after receiving the loans, give themselves more; or use it for speculative trading for the village cooperative; or leave it untouched without lending it to poor farmers, and even some individual village cadres embezzle. On the part of the masses, some who have been liberated have not established a foundation, fearing they will not be able to repay in the autumn; some fear being labeled as rich peasants if they buy livestock, and "take pride in being poor"; some demand that the bank lend more. According to the experiences of Qinghe in Jinnan, Licheng and Lucheng in Taihang, and Jincheng in Taiyue, the leadership should first mobilize and educate the village cadres and the masses, explaining that bank loans are for support, and that the main thing is to combine mass fundraising with loans. Then, through group and general meetings for self-criticism, ideological obstacles are removed, and production plans are formulated to solve the problems.

　　II. The combination of public loans and mass fundraising: Last winter, Chen Village in Lucheng proposed to increase sixteen livestock, requiring a loan of 400,000 yuan. Later, a production plan was made, and only 80,000 yuan was borrowed, and another 80,000 yuan was raised by the masses. With this 160,000 yuan of capital, they engaged in mat weaving and coal transportation, earning 1.62 million yuan in one month. The sixteen livestock required about 1 million yuan, thus solving the problem. In Tunliu, the masses raised two-thirds of the funds, and the bank loaned one-third (repayment in one month). Interest rates are divided into three types: 1.5% per month for those who buy livestock for their own use, 3% for those who buy and sell to their own village, and 5% for those who make livestock trading their profession. Many livestock have now been bought back. Wang Baixiao of Xipang Village in Neiqiu borrowed 3,000 yuan last year, and with his own 3,000 yuan of savings, he used this 6,000 yuan to buy cloth. The cloth was exchanged for small calves and donkeys. After spring plowing, the cattle and donkeys were again exchanged for cloth, and the cloth was exchanged for cattle again. Now the cattle are worth 35,000 yuan. After repaying the loan, he bought ten mu of land and earned 29,900 yuan.

　　III. Rotating loans for concentrated use: Last year, Zhao Muqun, a labor hero in Licheng, borrowed 20,000 yuan and used his own 20,000 yuan to buy a mule for transportation, earning back the price of the mule in twenty days. Then he re-loaned it to Zhang Peiyi to buy a donkey and organize transportation, earning back the loan, and then loaned it to others. In the autumn, the whole village bought four mules and three donkeys, organizing a total of twenty livestock, earning 200,000 yuan. Other counties such as Qixian, Pingshun, Yushe, and Wuxiang generally adopt this method.

　　IV. Concentrated loans for rotating use: In Huangyan, Xiyang, the village takes out a loan of 20,000 yuan under contract, which is managed by the cooperative and distributed to two households, 10,000 yuan per household. After earning money through transportation, they repay the cooperative, who then lend it to others. Upon maturity, the cooperative repays the principal and interest to the bank. In Heshun, the mutual aid group is the unit. Group A uses the loan and then re-loans it to Group B. When the loan term expires, Group A recovers the principal and interest and returns it to the bank.

　　V. The mass line of distribution: In Tian Shi Village, Jincheng, the masses are first allowed to report the amount of loan they need and its purpose. The group discusses and evaluates, and then the masses democratically elect an inspection committee to re-evaluate based on the group's opinions and the family's financial situation and the purpose of the loan. After the re-evaluation, it is announced to the masses for approval. After the assessment, the borrowers are organized into groups and separate repayment plans are drawn up. This not only enables the borrowers to mutually guarantee repayment, but also promotes production plans and encourages competition through loans.

　　In addition, Fugui Village in Qinyuan centralized 200,000 yuan of capital to establish a credit cooperative to solve production difficulties, which is also in line with the loan spirit in Vice Chairman Rong's production summary at the Second Committee of the Border Region Government this year. In short, in the concrete work of mobilizing and issuing loans, on the existing basis of combining liberation and production, we should form a mass loan movement based on the actual needs of the peasants, in order to solve the difficulties of the masses in spring plowing production.

### 春耕贷款经验介绍

　　春耕贷款经验介绍
    边府办公室  郝寥夫
    目前各地正进行春耕贷款以解决生产上困难问题，现就局部经验提出几点，以供大家参考。
    一、如何解决村干部与群众思想问题：有些村干部，贷款到手，给自己多贷些；或给村合作社做投机买卖；或原封不动放着，没有贷给贫苦农民，甚至个别村干部中饱。在群众方面，有的翻了身没有打下基础，怕秋后还不了；有的怕买了牲口说他是富农，而“以贫为荣”；有的要求银行多贷些。这些问题，根据冀南清河，太行黎城、潞城，太岳晋城等地的经验，首先是领导上对村干部与群众动员教育，说明银行贷款是扶持作用，主要是群众集资与贷款结合起来进行。再经小组、大会检讨，打通思想，订出生产计划解决问题。
    二、公家贷款与群众集资的结合：潞城陈村去冬提出要增加十六个牲口，须贷款四十万元，后来订出生产计划，只贷八万元，再由群众集资八万元，以此十六万元资金打席运炭，一个月赚一百六十二万元，十六个牲口约需一百万元，因此解决了问题。屯留群众集资三分之二，银行贷款三分之一（一月还款）。利率分三种：群众自己买牲口用一分五厘，贩回卖给本村者三分，以贩牲口为职业者五分，现已贩回不少牲口。内邱西庞村王白小去年贷款三千元，配合他的存资三千元，把这六千元买成布，布换了小牛小驴，春耕后，牛驴又换布，布又换牛，现牛值三万五千元，除还贷款外，买地十亩，赚洋二万九千九。
    三、轮流贷款集中使用：去年黎城劳英赵木群贷款二万元，自己二万元，买骡一头，搞运输，二十天赚回骡价，再转贷给张培义买驴一头，组织运输，赚回贷款，又贷给别人。秋后，全村买骡四头驴三头，共组织二十个牲口，赚洋二十万元。其他如祁县、平顺、榆社、武乡等县，一般采用这种方法。
    四、集中贷款轮流使用：昔阳黄岩以村为单位，立约贷款二万元，由合作社掌握分配给两户，每户一万元，运输赚钱后，还合作社，再贷别人。到期由合作社还本息于银行。和顺是以互助组为单位，甲组使用后转贷给乙组。贷款期满，由甲收回本息交还银行。
    五、发放的群众路线：晋城西南田石村贷款，首先让群众自报需要贷款数及用途，小组评议，再由群众民主选举组成检查委员会，根据小组意见，按家庭困难情况、贷款用途进行复评。复评后，再向群众宣布，由群众批准。评定后，将贷款人编成小组，分别订分零还计划。这样不但使贷款户可以互保归还，而且通过贷款推动生产计划，鼓励竞赛。
    此外，沁源伏贵村集中二十万元资本，成立信用合作社，解决生产中困难问题，这也是符合于今年边府二次委员会戎副主席生产总结中的贷款精神。总之，在动员与发放贷款具体工作中，在现有的翻身与生产结合基础上，应依据农民实际需要，形成群众性的贷款运动，以解决群众春耕生产中的困难。
