　　Thriving Industry and Commerce in Xing City

Under the vigorous support of the democratic government, industry and commerce in Xing City have developed greatly. When the city was liberated in early November of the 34th year of the Republic of China [1945], there were only over 1,300 stationary merchants, 296 itinerant merchants, and 534 vendors. By December of last year, the number of stationary merchants had increased to over 1,700, vendors to over 1,200, and there were also over 600 factories and workshops. Among the factories and workshops, the development of the iron industry, textile industry, and fur industry was the most significant.

　　I. Textile Industry: During the enemy's occupation, all industries were shut down because cotton was under control and machines were sealed. After liberation, they gradually recovered with the help of government loans. Currently, the city can produce 2,880 dozen towels, 1,410 *zhang* of various wide fabrics, and over 4,500 dozen socks and sweaters, waistbands, etc. Factories' products sell well everywhere and cannot meet demand. Factories combine with the masses, organizing many women to participate in production. Those who opened weaving factories have all become rich. For example, the Zhidar factory had 200,000 yuan in capital and only two machines, but earned a profit of 400,000 yuan in eight months. The Yizhong factory on Ma Shi Street had 200,000 yuan in capital and earned as much as 340,000 yuan in dividends from August to December. Now the capital has expanded to 4.3 million yuan.

　　II. Iron Industry: Now it has developed from 15 households to 23 households. In the past eight months, it produced 417 manual bows, 217 horsepower bows, 135 embossing machines, 23 spinning machines, and over 40,000 *jin* of agricultural tools and supplies. Now each factory is drawing up its own plan to increase production and is preparing to manufacture a large number of iron-wheel looms. The scale of factories has gradually expanded. For example, the Jingxing factory could not operate well due to the control of coal and iron during the enemy's occupation, resulting in huge losses. After liberation, in just one year, with the support of the democratic government, it now has 28 workers, more than 2 million yuan in capital, and has established a branch factory in Xingmu Han. Last year, after all expenses were paid, the net profit was over 1.7 million yuan. The Dasheng boiler factory originally had only 250,000 yuan in capital, but earned more than 3 million yuan in dividends last year, exceeding the original capital by more than 13 times.

　　III. The Xingtai fur industry, which is famous in North China, had long been destroyed by the enemy. After liberation, 34 fur shops resumed business. In the past half year, they exported 400,000 sheepskins. There are also 16 fur workshops, 2 leather factories, 10 leather strip shops, 1 whip tip shop, 1 leather glue shop, and 1 drum skin shop. Their products can supply the needs of various counties near Xingtai. In particular, the leather bags, various leather goods, and gun holsters made by the leather factory are of better quality and more durable than foreign goods, so they can be sold in large quantities in Southern Hebei, Taihang, and Central Hebei. At the same time, the profits of fur shops are also very high. For example, the Gongxing fur shop had a capital of 560,000 yuan last year and earned over 1.2 million yuan in half a year. The municipal government, in order to reward industry and commerce, exempts all newly opened factories and shops from one season's business tax burden.

As a result of the development of industry and commerce, the market has prospered, and the lives of workers and citizens have been greatly improved. Ma Lu Street was the poorest street in Xing City before liberation. There were only 11 households with land, and the rest were vagrants from all over the country who had no means of livelihood. Out of a total of 595 households and more than 2,000 men and women in the entire street, 522 households and 1,692 people could not maintain their lives. After liberation, in addition to distributing a batch of relief grain, the government restored industry and commerce, opened up markets, issued loans, and organized citizens to produce. Guo Weijin from this street borrowed 100,000 yuan from the bank and earned a profit of more than 600,000 yuan in two months. Last year, 75 houses were built on the entire street. In the mass movement, all the poor people on the street turned over and had food and clothing.

Under the policy of developing industry and commerce through self-reliance, the Xingtai market has been transformed. Zhongshan Street, North Main Street, and Flower Market Street were colonial markets filled with luxury goods and consumables when they were occupied by Japanese imperialism; today they have become local product markets for the necessities of people's lives. At the same time, through this year of industrial and commercial construction, the market has greatly prospered. Merchants and vendors are piled up at the doorways of shops on both sides of the street, and the lives of the city's 30,000 citizens have something to rely on. (Xing City Finance Office)

### 欣欣向荣的邢市工商业

　　欣欣向荣的邢市工商业
    邢市工商业在民主政府大力扶植下，有很大发展。该市卅四年十一月初解放时，只有座商一千三百余户，行商二百九十六户，摊贩五百三十四户，到去年十二月座商已增至一千七百余户，摊贩一千二百余户，另外有工厂作坊六百余户，工厂作坊中以铁工业、纺织工业、皮毛业的发展最为显著。
    一、纺织工业敌在时，因棉花被统制，机器被封闭，所有工业全部停业；解放后，经政府贷款扶助，才逐渐恢复。现全市每月可产手巾二千八百八十打，各种宽面布一千四百一十丈，袜子四千五百余打及毛衣腰巾等。工厂出品，畅销各地，供不应求，工厂与群众相结合，组织很多妇女参加生产。开织工厂的都发了财，如志达工厂二十万元资本，只有两架机子，八个月即获利四十万元，马市街益众工厂资本二十万元，从八月到十二月共赚红利三十四万元之多，现在资本已扩大到四百三十万元。
    二、铁工业现在已由十五户发展到二十三户，去年八个月即产人力弓四百一十七个，马力弓二百十七个，压花车百三十五个，纺线机二十三个，农具用品四万余斤。现在各工厂正在订出自己的计划，提高生产量，并准备大量制造铁轮织布机，工厂规模已逐渐扩大。如镜兴工厂敌在时因统制煤铁，不能很好进行营业，以致赔累甚大；解放后短短一年的光景，在民主政府扶助下，现已有工人二十八个，资本在二百万元以上，并在邢木寒设立分厂。去年除全部开支消耗外，净赚红利百七十余万元。大生造锅工厂原资本只二十五万元，去年赚红利三百余万元，超过原资本十三倍之多。
    三、在华北驰名的邢台皮毛业早已被敌人摧毁，解放后皮毛店复业三十四户，去年半年里即输出羊皮四十万张，并有皮毛作坊十六户，皮革工厂二户，皮条铺十户，鞭稍铺一个，皮胶一户，鼓皮一户。他们的产品可供邢台附近的各县需用，尤其是制革厂所制之皮包各种皮件枪套等，比外来货质美耐用，所以能大量推销于冀南、太行、冀中各地，同时皮毛店的利润也很大。如公兴皮店去年资本五十六万元，半年即获利百二十余万元。市政府为了奖励工商业，凡新开各种工厂和商店皆免征一季营业税负担。
    工商业发展的结果，市场是繁荣了，工人和市民生活也大大改善了。马路街在解放前是邢市一个最穷的街道，座地户只有十一户，其余都是没有生活依靠的各地游民迁移至此。全街总共五百九十五户，男女二千余口中即有五百廿二户，一千六百九十二口人不能维持生活的。解放后，政府除发放一批救济粮外，并恢复工商业，开辟市场、发放贷款、组织市民生产。本街郭维金在银行贷款十万元，两个月即赚利六十万元之多，去年全街盖房子七十五间，群众运动中，全街贫民都翻了身，有吃有穿。
    在自给自足的发展工商业的政策下，邢台市场已改头换面。中山街、北大街、花市街，在日本帝国主义占领时，是奢侈品消耗品满布了的殖民地市场；今天已变为人民生活必需品的土货市场了，同时经这一年的工商业建设，市场是大大繁荣，行商、摊贩，堆满了一街两旁的商号门口，全市三万市民的生活也都有了依靠。（邢市财办）
