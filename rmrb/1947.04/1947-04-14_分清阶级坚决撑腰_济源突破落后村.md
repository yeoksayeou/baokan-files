　　Distinguish Class, Resolutely Support
    Jiyuan Breaks Through Backward Villages
    [This newspaper, Taiyue, 11th dispatch] In the Jiyuan review, through in-depth ideological mobilization, more than ten backward villages have been broken through, and the following experiences have been gained: First, class division is combined with leadership support to embolden the masses. For example, in Qiulizhuang, in the first district, cadres went down several times but found no problems. The masses only said: "Our village is all 'second-rate households' of about the same level, there are no problems." After half a day of class division, the masses truly recognized the true nature of the landlords and bullies. At the same time, the leadership promptly supported the masses, and the masses began to struggle. Once, the whole village held a meeting to discuss who was the local tyrant. At first, no one spoke. Later, a few people said: "There are no big local tyrants in our village." An activist stood up and said: "If there are no big local tyrants, are there any second-rate local tyrants?" The leadership also immediately supported him, and a militiaman immediately denounced Jia Yanchun, a hidden local tyrant sitting next to him. Second, mobilize women to collude with each other to promote men. The men in Furentou Village had been persecuted by landlords and bullies several times, and were very afraid to speak; at the same time, the village had experienced severe years of famine and conscription by the Japanese invaders, and half of the men had died. Therefore, there were many widows and orphans, who lacked labor, were extremely poor, and suffered the most. Therefore, the review in this village started with mobilizing women. When the Women's Federation led women to discuss their own difficulties, many people cried. After the meeting, everyone encouraged their children to rise up and fight against the landlords. Soon, more than a hundred people were organized to demand houses and land from the landlords. Third, send activists from advanced villages to mobilize the masses in backward villages to speak out about their grievances. For example, Nanzhuang Village is still a village dominated by feudal forces, and the masses have not yet raised their heads. Activists from the advanced village of Wushan were mobilized to encourage the masses through relatives and friends. In less than three days, a vigorous struggle was launched. Fourth, in areas where there is a gap between cadres and the masses, we must first start by adjusting the relationship between cadres and the masses in order to bring the movement into line with regulations. Fifth, in the border areas where land has been distributed but the masses have not been mobilized to speak out about their grievances, it is necessary to re-ignite speaking out about grievances so that the masses recognize that they are the masters of the land.

　　分清阶级坚决撑腰
    济源突破落后村
    【本报太岳十一日电】济源复查中，深入思想动员，十余个落后村庄已经突破，并获得以下经验：第一、划分阶级与领导上撑腰壮胆。如一区之邱礼庄，干部下去几次皆未发现问题。群众只说：“咱村都是不差上下的‘二把户’没有啥问题啦。”经过半日的划分阶级后，群众才真正认识了地主恶霸的本貌，同时领导上便及时给群众撑腰，群众才斗争起来。有一次全村群众开会讨论谁是恶霸，起初无一人发言，后来有几个人说：“咱村就没有大恶霸”。一个积极分子站起来说：“没有大恶霸；是否有二恶霸？”领导上也即时撑腰，一个民兵便将同坐的一个隐蔽恶霸贾燕春当场检举出来。第二、发动妇女互相串通，推动男人。夫人头村男人曾被地主恶霸迫害过数次，甚为恐惧不敢说话；同时该村经过严重的灾荒年与日寇的抓丁，男人死亡至一半。因此妇女孤寡甚多，她们缺乏劳力，异常贫穷，痛苦亦最深，所以在该村进行复查首先便从动员妇女着手。妇救会领导妇女讨论她们本身的困难时，很多人都哭了，会后个个鼓励她们的子弟起来与地主斗争。很快的组织了百余人向地主要房、要地。第三、派先进村庄的积极分子，发动落后村庄群众诉苦，如南庄村仍是封建势力占统治的村子，群众尚未抬头，便动员武山先进村的积极分子，通过亲朋关系，鼓励群众斗志，不上三天时间，便展开轰轰烈烈的斗争。第四、干群有隔阂的地区，首先要从调整干群关系入手，才能使运动纳入正规。第五、在边沿区已分配土地而未发动群众诉苦的地区，要重新诉苦，让群众认识自己是土地的主人。
