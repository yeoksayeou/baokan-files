　　[This dispatch from our newspaper in Taiyue on the 3rd] After the Pingyao Fifth District overcame retreatist thought, the situation quickly opened up. Since the "suppression" carried out by Yan's army's 44th and 46th Divisions in the area of Liangcun, Zhaocun, Feiyan, and Changcun in this district from February 16th, the "Dare to Charge Corps" in the area also took the opportunity to make trouble. Because the local cadres were not adequately prepared ideologically, they did not actively organize the masses, arm the masses, or encourage the masses' fighting spirit, but simply retreated, causing the situation to deteriorate. At the beginning of March, an enlarged cadre meeting was held in the whole district, and the leadership proposed: "Combine guerrilla warfare with land distribution, and cadres personally lead armed turn-over teams deep into the enemy's heart." Soon after the meeting, the democratic regimes in Dongxigoshan, Nanhu, Zhehu, Zhaobi and other villages in the district were restored. The "maintenance elements" dared not "maintain" any more, and the local bullies and landlords also stopped "reversing the accounts".
    [This dispatch from our newspaper in Taiyue on the 3rd] The merit-earning campaign of the militias in Quwo, Xiangling, and Fushan is developing vigorously. The Quwo militia, headed by Sun Hailin of the Fourth District, went deep into the Mengcheng Highway area. From March 4th to 14th, in ten days, they attacked 15 enemy transport carts, seized more than 30 dan of wheat, 800 jin of edible salt, 500 jin of peanuts, and 3 horses. Yang Yuxiu, who led the militia of the Second District, killed Zhao Zhenjia, the man-eating demon most hated by the masses, and his three lackeys on the evening of the 10th, and seized 3 rifles and 1 pistol. Wu Qingshan's militia in the Fifth District, who besieged the stronghold of the Four Villages, rushed into Dongrong Village, three miles away from the Licun stronghold, on the 19th, and captured four stubborn army officers below the battalion level, and seized 3 long and short guns. News of merits kept circulating among the guerrilla groups, and the militia's morale was even more excited. The Xiangling militia actively operated in the area where the Fenhe Railway crisscrossed. From the 4th to the 19th, they killed, wounded, and captured 68 enemies, seized 1 machine gun, 12 rifles, 1 pistol, 1 telescope, 95,000 yuan of Chiang currency, 9 rails, and 120 jin of electric wire. The Fushan militia fought nine times in half a month, eliminating 21 enemies, and destroyed 11 sections of the Linfu and Fuyi Highways. On the 17th, a Chiang army plainclothes team of 9 people risked coming out to operate. As soon as they stepped into the minefield near Jia Village, all of them were caught in the net, and only one person escaped.

　　平遥五区克复退却思想
    许多村庄恢复民主政权
    曲沃等地民兵竞相杀敌立功
    【本报太岳三日电】平遥五区克服退却思想后，局面迅即打开。该区自二月十六号阎军四十四师与四十六师进行“清剿”以来，梁村、赵村、飞沿、常村一带之“奋勇团”也乘机出扰，当地干部因思想准备不够，未积极的组织群众、武装群众、鼓励群众斗志，只是单纯的退却，致使局面恶化。三月初召开全区扩大干部会议，领导上提出：“游击战争和分田结合，干部亲自领导武装翻身大队，深入敌人心脏。”会后不久，即恢复了该区东西戈山、南湖、遮湖、赵壁等村的民主政权，维持分子再不敢“维持”，恶霸地主也停止了“倒算”。
    【本报太岳三日电】曲沃、襄陵、浮山民兵立功运动正蓬勃展开。曲沃以孙海林为首的四区民兵，深入蒙城公路活动。三月四日到十四日十日内，袭击敌运输大车十五辆，缴获麦子三十余石、食盐八百斤、花生五百斤、马三匹。二区杨玉秀率领的民兵于十日晚打死群众最痛恨的吃人魔王赵振家及其狗腿三人，缴获步枪三支、手枪一支。围困四村据点的五区吴青山民兵，十九日冲入离曲村据点三里之东容村，生俘顽军营长以下四名，缴获长短枪三支。立功捷报不断轮转于各个游击集团，民兵情绪更是兴奋。襄陵民兵在汾河铁路交错地区积极活动，四日至十九日毙伤俘敌六十八名，缴获机枪一挺、步枪十二支、手枪一支、望远镜一架、蒋币九万五千元、铁轨九根、电线百二十斤。浮山民兵半月作战九次，歼敌二十一人，并将临浮、浮翼两公路破坏十一处。十七日有蒋军便衣队九人冒险出来活动，刚踏入贾庄附近雷区，即全部落网，仅一人逃脱。
