　　Horse Farm Organizes Transportation
    Earns Enough to Buy Thirty Head of Livestock
    [This newspaper's Lucheng dispatch] Machang Village in the Fifth District of Lucheng has 354 households with a population of 1,170, and more than 6,300 mu of land; but there are only 42 head of livestock. To complete the large-scale production, the farmers all feel that their hearts are willing but their strength is insufficient. Therefore, the leadership put forward the call of "Three cobblers are equal to one Zhuge Liang; mutual aid is powerful, and more people have more wisdom," so that everyone can come up with ideas. Each mutual aid group held production meetings separately, and everyone deliberated. Shi Kuanxing, the head of the fourth group, sighed and said: "In the past, some people had no land to cultivate, but now there is land but it cannot be cultivated. Anyway, it will still be poverty!" Xu Zhongxin, a member of the group, said: "The landlords can cultivate their land well because they have livestock. Otherwise, they would be just as barren as us." Li Aide continued: "That's right! If we don't buy livestock, they will be just as barren as us. Let's buy livestock quickly." Wang Zhongbao said: "Chairman Mao has called for us to turn ourselves over. If we starve after cultivating the land, how can we be worthy of him? We must buy livestock."
    The discussion became more and more heated, and the result was a decision that there must be one head of livestock for every Qing of land. Their specific methods are: 1. Those who are allocated livestock shares should earn a head of livestock in one and a half months of production. This was proposed by the political instructor, who realized that the big black donkey he was allocated was obtained by the masses through struggle. He said: "The livestock that the old farmers fought for me, I can't turn around and let the old farmers have no land to cultivate." His lead moved Zhao Jingrong and Yan Manfu, who were both willing to earn a head of livestock by transporting goods with their livestock, and they realized this in less than five days after the meeting, buying three good oxen. 2. The farmers who were formerly middle peasants proposed at the meeting: "We middle peasants have a more solid foundation than the newly liberated brothers. We strive not to rely on the mutual aid group's livestock to plow the land for us. We strive to find our own way to buy livestock." Yan Guisheng, Wang Caiwang, and others each bought a head of livestock, for a total of three head. 3. Political instructor Li Wanyou also called for forming a transportation team with all 42 livestock in the village to sell coal in Licheng, Yangquan, and other areas to earn money to buy livestock. On the other hand, he called for raising funds to buy livestock. At that time, only the second mutual aid group registered to raise 14,000 yuan, plus 22.5 shi of corn and 8.5 shi of millet, totaling more than 80,000 yuan, which was decided to be used to carry goods to Xingtai for sale, which could buy two head of livestock.
    From the meeting on the sixteenth day of the first month to the end of February, the masses created various methods and have already purchased 31 head of livestock, exceeding the original plan of one head of livestock per Qing of land, and they are still continuing to buy. (Ji Pinxian)

　　马场组织运输
    赚买牲口卅头
    【本报潞城讯】潞城五区马厂村，有三百五十四户，一千一百七十口人，六千三百多亩地；但仅有牲口四十二头，要完成大生产，农民都感到是心有余而力不足，于是领导上就提出“三个牛皮匠顶个诸葛亮；互助力量大，人多智谋高”的号召，使大家生办法，各互助组分头召开生产会议，大家酝酿。四大组小组长石宽兴叹气说：“从前是有人没地种，现在是有地种不过，反正该穷！”组员徐忠信说：“老财地多还能种好，不是凭他有牲口，管保和咱一样荒。”李爱德接着说：“对！不买牲口凭＠刨他和咱一样，快买牲口吧。”王中保说：“毛主席叫翻咱了身，如果荒了地还饿肚，怎对得起他老人家，一定要买牲口。”
    大家越吵越热，吵的结果，决定每一顷地必须有一个牲口。他们的具体办法是：一、凡是分得果实牲口的，在一个半月中生产赚一头牲口，这是政治指导员提出的，他认识到他分的大黑驴是群众举拳头斗出来的，他说：“老农民给我斗的牲口，我还能反叫老农民种不上地。”他这一带头，感动起赵景荣、阎满福都愿以牲口运输赚一头牲口，并且在会后不到五天就兑了现，买来三只好牛。二、旧中农成分的农民，在会上提出“咱们中农比刚翻身弟兄底根殷实，我们争取不靠互助组牲口给咱犁地，我们争取自己生办法买牲口。阎贵生、王才旺等于是各买牲口一头，共买了三头。三、政治指导员李万有，又号召把全村四十二个牲口组成运输队，向黎城、阳泉一带卖炭，赚钱买牲口，另一面号召集资买牲口，当时登记集资，只第二互助组，就集了一万四千元，又玉茭二十二石五斗，小米八石五斗，共合洋八万多，决定顺便捎货到邢台卖了，就可买到牲口两头。
    从正月十六开会起到二月底，群众创造了各种各样办法，已买进牲口三十一头，超过原来一顷地一头牲口的计划，而且还在继续买。（吉品先）
