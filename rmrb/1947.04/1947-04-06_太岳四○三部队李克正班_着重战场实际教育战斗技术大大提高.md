　　Taiyue 403 Unit, Li Kezheng's Platoon
　　Emphasizing Practical Battlefield Education, Combat Skills Greatly Improved
　　[This newspaper, Taiyue, 3rd dispatch] Li Kezheng, the platoon leader of the 9th Platoon of the 3rd Company of the 403 Unit, seized every combat gap to conduct military training and education, greatly improving the combat skills of the entire platoon. The platoon's training was not delayed even during marching and sentry duty. In the early morning, they went out to practice "platoon assault" against the enemy, and in the evening after returning from sentry duty, they practiced village combat. On moonlit nights, everyone watched their shadows to correct their posture. Comrade Li Kezheng said, "If you don't want to suffer in battle, you must train hard in peacetime." "If your movements are not skilled in peacetime, you will suffer more in battle." His educational methods have the following characteristics:
　　(1) Inspire enthusiasm for learning and make everyone aware of the importance of learning. He repeatedly used the lessons of bloodshed in battle to educate the soldiers. On the one hand, he motivated everyone's hatred for the enemy, wanting to avenge the wounded comrades; on the other hand, he taught everyone to accept the lessons of battle and recognize why those people were injured through self-examination. Only after the soldiers' thinking is clear can training be serious and practical.
　　(2) Emphasize practical drills and require accurate movements. If a soldier does not know a movement, he will make him do it several times. In practical drills, he found the soldiers' problems, such as when touching a military sentry post, the soldier immediately climbed on the grave, exposing the target before hiding; he immediately told him that when arriving at the hiding place, he should move from a low place to a high place. When reaching a humid area, the soldiers were unwilling to pass through, fearing that their clothes would get wet. He passed through first, and then let the soldiers pass through. He said, "What's the big deal about getting your clothes wet? If you don't know this movement, it's not worth it if you suffer losses on the battlefield!" He made everyone familiar with the movements with the requirement that "the training ground is the battlefield."
　　(3) He not only paid attention to peacetime education, but also paid attention to battlefield education. During the ambush battle in Huoxian County, when the team was resting on the mountain, he took the opportunity to tell everyone, "When the enemy goes up the mountain, aim at the head; when the enemy goes down the mountain, aim at the feet." When the enemy's artillery shells were fired, he told everyone to calmly hide, and at the same time introduced the power of various weapons, from how to kill the enemy in detail to how to save themselves, so that everyone reduced fear and casualties. This kind of battlefield education is even more effective than peacetime education. When the reporter visited platoon leader Li's education method, what the soldiers remembered most was practical battlefield education.
　　(4) His training method is a combination of drills and research. When practicing "platoon assault," he would hold a meeting to review as soon as he came back. If he found any unrealistic movements, he would immediately correct them in the next drill. From action to understanding, from understanding to correction, this made everyone's learning very effective and progress very fast. (Zhang Keren)

　　太岳四○三部队李克正班
  　着重战场实际教育战斗技术大大提高
    【本报太岳三日电】四○三部三连九班长李克正同志抓紧一切战斗空隙进行练兵教育，使全班战斗技术大大提高。该班的练兵，甚至在行军放哨的时候也不耽误。清早出去朝着敌人演习“班进攻”，晚间收哨归来演习村落战斗。月夜里，大家看着影子纠正姿势。李克正同志说：“要想打仗不吃亏，只有平时多苦练。”“平时动作不熟，打仗就要多吃苦。”他的教育方式有以下几个特点：
    （一）启发学习的热情，引起大家对学习的重视。他反复用战斗中流血的教训教育战士，一方面激励大家对敌人的仇恨，要为负伤的同志报仇；另一方面又教大家接受战斗的教训，从检讨中认识那些人是为什么负伤的。只有让战士思想明确后，练兵才能作到认真、实际。
    （二）重视实际演习，要求动作确实。战士一个动作不会，他让作好几回。在实际演习中，发现战士的毛病，如摸军事哨时，战士一下爬在坟上暴露了目标后才隐蔽；他马上告诉，到达隐蔽地时，要从低处向高处移动。到了潮湿地带，战士不愿通过，怕把衣服弄湿，他首先通过，再让战士通过。他说：“一身衣服弄温怕什么，要是不会这动作，战场上受了损失才不值得！”他以“操场就是战场”的要求让大家熟悉动作。
    （三）他不仅注意平时教育，而且注意战场教育。霍县伏击战中，队伍在山上进行休息时，他乘机告诉大家：“敌人上山要瞄头打，敌人下山要瞄脚打。”敌人炮弹射击时，他让大家沉着隐蔽，同时介绍各种武器的威力，从如何杀伤敌人详细说到如何保存自己，使大家减少了恐惧与伤亡。这种战场教育，较之平时教育收效尤大。当记者访问李班长的教育方法时，战士们首先记得的即是战场实际教育。
    （四）他的练兵方式是演习与研究结合。演习“班进攻”时，一回来就开会检讨。发现有不切合实际的动作，立即到下次演习中纠正。由行动到认识、由认识到纠正、这样使大家学习的效果都很好，进步都很快。（张克仁）
