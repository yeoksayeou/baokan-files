　　Fan County, Yancunpu Village's Whole Village Mutual Aid
    Men Plow the Fields, Women Investigate the Land
    [This Newspaper reports] Yancunpu Village in Fan County still needs continued investigation; however, the spring plowing season has arrived. Over ten head of cattle have been recovered. How can we proceed with spring plowing? This is a major difficulty. Some people suggested organizing mutual aid to pull the plows, but the masses are not accustomed to calculating manpower. After calculations, it was determined that even if they worked through the entire spring plowing period, they would not be able to finish. The Turn-Over Committee conducted research and finally decided to organize temporary whole-village spring plowing mutual aid, based on the spirit of contributing manpower if one has manpower and animal power if one has animal power, and a spring plowing plan was established. The village has one hundred head of cattle, divided into fifty pairs. Each pair will complete two mu per day. The whole village has approximately four hundred mu of land to be plowed, which can be completed in five days. The plowing order is according to military personnel, workers, families of martyrs, poor peasants, orphans, middle peasants… Women and those not participating in spring plowing will continue to investigate the landlords and distribute the fruits of the harvest. Regarding grinding flour, it is stipulated that it will be completely replaced by human power. Those without livestock will grind for those with livestock in exchange for labor, and those without anyone to grind for them will have to provide the grinder with a meal. In this way, the contradiction between spring plowing and land investigation in the village was resolved.

　　范县颜村铺全村大互助
    男人春耕妇女查田
    【本报讯】范县颜村铺，现在仍需要继续清查；可是春耕已来到，牛只收回了十来头，春耕怎办呢？这是一个大困难。有的人提出组织互助拉犁，但群众不习惯人力计算，算了算春耕期过去也弄不完。翻身委员会作了研究，最后决定组织临时全村春耕大互助，根据有人力出人力，有畜力出畜力的精神，定出春耕计划。全村耕牛一百头，划为五十犋，每犋每天完成二亩，全村约四百多亩禾犁者，五天即可完成，犁的次序按军、工、烈属、贫农、孤儿、中农……。妇女及不参加春耕者仍进行对地主的清查、分果实。对于磨面，规定：完全用人力代替，无牲口者给有牲口者推磨换工，无人者给推磨者要管饭一顿。这样一来，村里的春耕与查田的矛盾解决了。
