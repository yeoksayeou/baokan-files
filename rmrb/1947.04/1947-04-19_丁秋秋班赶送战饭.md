　　Ding Qiuqiu's Class Rushes to Deliver Battle Meals
　　·Fu Zheng·
　　Ding Qiuqiu is a cook squad leader in the Tai Shan unit. During the Zhaojiachang battle, he personally went to the front line to deliver meals and participated in the assault team. He was selected as a special model worker. His story is detailed in the "Taihang Literature and Art Magazine," Volume 3, Issue 2. Now he is working hard to create a model squad.
　　——Editor

　　Being a hero is not easy,
　　Hands must be diligent, heart must be meticulous;
　　It's not enough to do well yourself,
　　You must also encourage others to achieve merit.
　　True heroes are rare,
　　Let me tell you the story of Ding Qiuqiu:

　　Celebrating victory after taking Zhaojiachang,
　　Tai Shan compared heroes again,
　　Who is the best among the model heroes?
　　It's Qiuqiu who is number one.
　　Rewarded at the heroes' meeting,
　　The prizes filled a bamboo dustpan,
　　Towels, socks, pencils, soap, everything,
　　And that shining model badge.
　　He kept the model badge,
　　Comrades asked him why?
　　He said:
　　"One head cannot cultivate a whole mountain of wasteland,
　　One hand cannot clap, can it?
　　Glory belongs to the whole squad,
　　Work is done by everyone,
　　Encourage the whole squad to achieve merit,
　　Let's all bring the badges up together."

　　Ding Qiuqiu returned with the prizes,
　　Went to Old Ma, his brother, in the squad,
　　Called out: "Comrade Shoufu, come and see,
　　Isn't this towel dense?"
　　Old Ma smiled cheekily,
　　And said: "Squad leader, you are truly glorious!
　　This towel is white, soft, and fine,
　　Keep it well.
　　It's a good mark of a hero!"
　　Qiuqiu quickly said:
　　"You are the most active in your work,
　　This towel is for you."
　　Old Ma was anxious when he heard this,
　　And quickly said: "I can't take yours,
　　This is your glorious prize,
　　I'll go buy my own."
　　Qiuqiu didn't listen to him,
　　And insisted on giving the gift.
　　Turning around, he busily called Old Li:
　　"Wear these socks!"
　　The remaining soap and pencils,
　　Were also sent to Old Zhou and Old Yue.

　　After distributing the prizes, he called a meeting,
　　Qiuqiu busily raised the topic:
　　"Fight Old Chiang, go kill the enemy,
　　So that the people are not bullied by the despots,
　　How can the whole squad do well?
　　Everyone, think of good ideas."
　　Comrades all agreed,
　　And eagerly put forward their opinions.
　　One said:
　　"Guarantee not to make undercooked rice,"
　　Another said:
　　"Guarantee to provide boiling water on time,"
　　And some wanted to learn from Squad Leader Ding,
　　To deliver food to the front line.
　　You are active, I am even more energetic,
　　One competes with the other.

　　One day,
　　The sun slanted to the west,
　　The food had to be delivered to the front line,
　　Qiuqiu was just about to carry it,
　　Zhou Chunsheng pulled his clothes,
　　"Squad leader, your eyes are bad and you can't see the road clearly,
　　You don't need to go, we have Old Li and me!"
　　Saying that, he snatched the carrying pole and bucket,
　　And carried the whole company's hot rice,
　　Hurrying ahead.
　　The quartermaster carried the dishes,
　　Following behind anxiously.
　　Laughing and talking along the way,
　　In the blink of an eye, they reached their destination.
　　The soldiers smiled sweetly when they smelled the aroma,
　　And praised Old Zhou and Old Li.
　　The rice pot was just placed on the ground,
　　When suddenly they were ordered to move positions,
　　The whole company transferred swiftly,
　　The three meal deliverers sighed.
　　"Comrades,
　　When will we be able to eat?"
　　"Comrades,
　　We can't march on an empty stomach."
　　The more they thought, the more unbearable it became,
　　So they lifted the food and chased after them.

　　Regardless of
　　The uphill and downhill being hard to walk,
　　Ignoring that
　　The company commander was shouting at them to go back,
　　They ran faster and faster, becoming more and more anxious.
　　The rice pot was carried to the front,
　　A rice bowl was quickly filled.
　　At this time,
　　The sun had sunk out of sight,
　　Everything was pitch black.
　　The three of them
　　Dashed forward,
　　Panting and out of breath.
　　Over the big slope, down to the hollow ground,
　　One foot high, one foot low,
　　They followed as the team walked,
　　Until not a grain of rice was left.
　　The comrades ate their fill,
　　The three of them were so tired that sweat dripped down.
　　Platoon Leader Yan, moved in his heart, praised them greatly;
　　"Eating while marching is truly rare,
　　First time I've seen it in ten years of military service,
　　We must:
　　Kill more Chiang bandits and achieve merit!"

　　丁秋秋班赶送战饭
    ·复正·
    丁秋秋是泰山部的一个炊事班长，赵家场战斗时，亲往火线送饭，并参加突击组，被选为特等工作模范，他的事迹详见太行文艺杂志三卷二期。现在他正努力创造一个模范班。
    ——编者
    当英雄，真不易，
    手得勤，心得细；
    不光自己干的好，
    还要推动别人把功立。
    真正的英雄不多见，
    我把丁秋秋故事提一提：
　
    打下赵家场庆胜利，
    泰山都又把英雄比，
    英雄模范数谁好，
    数着秋秋是第一。
    英雄会上受奖励，
    奖品得有一簸箕，
    毛巾、袜子、铅笔、肥皂样样有，
    还有那模范牌儿亮亮的。
    模范牌他保存起，
    同志问他为啥哩？
    他说道：
    “一个头开不了满山荒，
    一个巴掌怎能拍响哩？
    光荣本是全班的事，
    工作是大伙搞成的，
    推动全班都立功，
    齐把牌牌带上去。”
　
    丁秋秋带着奖品回，
    到班就找老马兄弟，
    叫声：“守福同志快来看，
    这条毛巾密不密？”
    老马抿嘴嘻嘻笑，
    连说：“班长你真光荣哩！
    这毛巾又白又软又细密，
    好好把它保存起。
    这是英雄的好标记！”
    秋秋连忙开言道：
    “干工作你最积极，
    这条毛巾送给你。”
    老马一听心里急，
    忙说：“那能要你的，
    这是你的光荣奖，
    我用我再去买去。”
    秋秋不听他言语，
    到底拉拉扯扯送了礼。
    回身又忙叫老李：
    “这双袜子你穿去！”
    剩下肥皂和铅笔，
    又给老周老岳送了去。
　
    分罢奖品开个会，
    秋秋又忙把话提：
    “打老蒋，去杀敌，
    为的百姓不受恶霸欺，
    全班怎样做的好，
    大家多想好主意。”
    同志齐声说同意，
    争着都把意见提。
    这个说：
    “保证不做生菜饭”，
    那个说：
    “保证开水按时给，”
    还有人要学丁班长，
    饭菜送上火线去。
    你积极我更卖力，
    一个跟着一个比。
　
    有一天，
    日头偏了西，
    饭菜要送到阵地里，
    秋秋正想担上走，
    周春生拉住他的衣，
    “班长害眼看不清路，
    有我和老李不用你！”
    说着抢过杠子桶，
    抬上全连的热米饭，
    呼扇呼扇跑头里。
    事务长担上菜，
    跟在后面走的急。
    一路说来一路笑，
    转眼到了目的地。
    战士闻见香味眯眯笑，
    边夸老周和老李。
    饭锅刚刚地上放，
    忽然奉命挪阵地，
    刷拉拉全连转移走，
    送饭的三人直叹气。
    “同志们，
    啥时能够吃上饭？”
    “同志们，
    忍饥跑路使不的。”
    越思越想越不忍，
    抬起饭菜撵上去。
　
    不管那
    上坡下坡不好走，
    不顾那
    连长喊他们往后去，
    越跑越快心越急。
    饭锅抬到顶前头，
    一个饭碗盛的急。
    这时候
    日头沉的没了影，
    四面都是黑漆漆。
    他三人
    呼扇呼扇窜的紧，
    呼呼喘喘透不过气。
    过大坡，下凹地，
    一脚高，一脚低，
    队伍走着他们又跟，
    直到饭没剩一粒。
    同志们吃的饱又饱，
    他三人累的汗直滴。
    阎排长，心里感动直夸好；
    “行军吃饭真稀奇，
    当兵十年头一次见，
    咱们要：
    多杀蒋贼把功立！”
