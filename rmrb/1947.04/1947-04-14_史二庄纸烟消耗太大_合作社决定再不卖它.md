　　Shi'erzhuang Cigarette Consumption Too High
    Cooperative Decides to Stop Selling Them
    [This report from Wu'an] The Shi'erzhuang Cooperative in the Ninth District, in view of the excessive consumption of cigarettes in the village, after suggestions from the masses, and discussions among village cadres and cooperative leaders, has decided to no longer sell cigarettes in the future. Previously, the cooperative sold at least fifty or sixty boxes every day, and at most, over a hundred boxes. If calculated at an average of eighty boxes per day, at ninety yuan per box, that's seven thousand two hundred yuan, which amounts to around two hundred thousand yuan per month, equivalent to about four thousand catties of millet. In a village primarily engaged in agricultural production with very little income from sideline occupations, this is truly a large sum. Moreover, the cooperative in the past mostly sold cigarettes on credit, which tied up a considerable amount of working capital, preventing it from being used for other production. After this decision, everyone supported it. The cooperative accountant said, "The cooperative is supposed to be for the benefit of everyone, but selling cigarettes not only doesn't benefit, it actually harms. So it's better not to sell them." The village chief said, "This is precisely in response to the higher authorities' call for tobacco control and thrift! You can talk all you want about not smoking, but if there's a place to buy them, and it's convenient, and you can get them on credit, who can resist making sure they don't smoke! Now that there's nowhere to buy them, even if they don't quit completely, they'll smoke less." The masses said, "That's right! In the past, I'd smoke a box every two or three days, but now I can get by without it. If it's really unbearable, I can still smoke dry tobacco!" (Wen)

　　史二庄纸烟消耗太大
    合作社决定再不卖它
    【本报武安讯】九区史二庄合作社，鉴于本村纸烟的消费太大，经群众提议，村干部及合作社负责人商议结果，决定今后决不再卖纸烟。以前合作社每天起码要卖出五六十盒，最多时曾达一百盒以上。如以每天平均八十盒，每盒九十元计算，就是七千二百元，一月就在二十万元上下，合小米四千斤左右。在这样一个以农业生产为主，很少副业收入的乡村，实在是一笔很大的数目。而且合作社在出卖纸烟上，过去多为赊账，以至在这上面又拦下了相当大的流动资金，不能用于别的生产。这样决定以后，大家都很拥护，合作社会计说：“合作社本来是为大家谋利的，卖纸烟不仅谋不下利，倒谋下害了。所以不卖它都好。”村长说：“这是正应上级戒烟节约的号召呀！你光说不叫吸，可是有地方卖，又方便，还能赊欠，谁能禁住一定不让他吸呢！现在买没处买，不完全戒掉也吸得少了。”群众说：“对啦！我先前那些天，三天两天要吸一盒，这会不吸也过了。实在不行，还可以抽旱烟！”（文）
