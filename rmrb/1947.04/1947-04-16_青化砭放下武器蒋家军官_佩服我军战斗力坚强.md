Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, April 14th. The 213 Kuomintang army officers of the 31st Brigade who laid down their weapons in the Qinghuabian campaign, 70 miles northeast of Yan'an, are currently residing safely in a certain area of Northern Shaanxi. This includes the brigade's Major General Brigade Commander Li Jiyun, Deputy Brigade Commander Zhou Laichang, Chief of Staff Xiong Zongji, and 92nd Regiment Commander Xie Yangmin, among other officers of general and colonel rank. Li and others have voluntarily removed their collar insignia and shoulder boards, but they still wear their American-style wide-brimmed military hats, and the local people mockingly call them "American slaves." When Li Jiyun discussed the issues related to this defeat, he often lowered his head in thought and could not explain it. However, he was able to recognize that: "You (referring to the People's Liberation Army) did not take advantage of gains or losses in one place, but we (referring to the Kuomintang army) focused on occupying places and suffered losses." He said that the brigade's defeat at Qinghuabian was because the People's Liberation Army moved very quickly and had extremely strong firepower, so that they "didn't even have time to deploy their firepower." The brigade was directly ordered by Hu Zongnan to proceed from Linzhen Town through the Chuankou area to Qinghuabian, and the troops were very exhausted. According to Wang Senlin, deputy company commander of the 92nd Regiment's machine gun company, "This time the soldiers brought seven days of dry rations, carrying as much as forty or fifty catties. When they reached Guaimaio, they thought they could rest, but they suddenly received orders in the middle of the night to attack Qinghuabian." Another deputy company commander, Kou Lizhan, said, "We hardly saw any civilians along the way, and we couldn't find any food. Occasionally, we would encounter one or two old women who hadn't moved away, and we could only search for one and a half sheng of millet." Many of the field-grade officers were wearing dirty and ragged soldiers' clothes, and Wang Senlin was one of them. According to him, "Generally, they would change into soldiers' clothes before the battle, so that if they were captured, they could deny being officers." Now they are divided into squads and live in a row of cave dwellings. When reporters visited them a few days ago, they had just settled down from marching. Some were taking turns getting haircuts, while others were leaning against the wall, reading books such as "On New Democracy," "On Coalition Government," and "Three Hundred Years Since Jia Shen." Some gathered together to play chess for entertainment.

　　青化砭放下武器蒋家军官
    佩服我军战斗力坚强
    【新华社陕北十四日电】在延安东北七十里青化砭之役放下武器的蒋军三十一旅军官一部二一三名，目前安全的住在陕北某地，其中包括该旅少将旅长李纪云、副旅长周赖昌、参谋长熊宗继及九十二团团长谢养民等将校级军官在内。李等领章肩章均已自动撕去，但美式宽边军帽仍戴在头上，沿途民众均嘲呼其为“美国奴”。李纪云于谈及与此次覆没有关问题时，辄低头深思而无以自解。但已能认识到：“你们（指人民解放军）不在一地的得失占了便宜，而我们（指蒋军）却着重于占领地方吃了亏。”他说该旅在青化砭之覆没，是因为解放军运动神速，火力极旺，以致使他们“展开火力的时候也没有。”该旅此次直接奉胡宗南命令，由临真镇经川口区进至青化砭，部队十分疲惫。据九十二团机枪连副连长王森林说：“这次士兵自带七天干粮，背负达四五十斤，到拐峁，因以为可以休息，但半夜突接到命令又进攻青化砭。”另一副连长寇力战说：“沿途简直看不到老百姓，也找不到粮食，偶而遇到个把没有迁走的老太婆，也只能搜索一升半合小米。”校尉级军官中很多是穿着肮脏褴褛的士兵衣服，王森林也是其中之一，据他说：“一般在作战之前即已换穿士兵衣服，这样如果被俘，也能以不承认自己是军官。”现在他们按班分住在一排窑洞里。日前记者前往参观时，他们行军甫定，有些正轮流理发，有的则倚墙而坐、阅读新民主主义论、论联合政府、甲申三百年祭等书籍。有的围拢一处下棋消遣。
