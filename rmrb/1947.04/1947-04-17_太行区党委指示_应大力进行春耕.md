　　Taihang District Party Committee Instructions
    Should Vigorously Carry Out Spring Plowing
    Combine Production with Reasonable and Balanced Land Distribution
    Help Liberated Peasants Solve Difficulties
    Not a Single Inch of Land Should Lie Fallow
    Not a Single Person Should Be Idle
    [Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] A comrade from Taihang said: Currently, the masses in various counties in the district are carrying out large-scale production in conjunction with resolving outstanding issues. He said: Except for border areas and temporarily occupied areas, the feudal system has been basically eliminated and the tillers own their land in both new and old areas of Taihang. On this basis, spring plowing and production must be carried out in conjunction. The Taihang District Party Committee's instructions issued to various counties the other day also clearly pointed out: The large-scale production campaign is about to begin, and all localities should carefully discuss the Central Bureau's "Production Instructions," paying close attention to smoothly and vigorously carrying out spring plowing on the basis of peasants acquiring land. Therefore, in the summarization of ideological education and unity movements, all localities should arrange spring plowing production in conjunction with resolving outstanding issues, conduct production education, and discover various obstacles to the production movement, which should be resolved by the masses in conjunction with the government. The District Party Committee also emphasized: In this process, we should muster our last bit of strength, continue strict inspection, and adjust and supplement the fruits, especially the quantity and quality of the land. The land that has been distributed must be personally inspected and marked with boundary stones. For the newly liberated veterans, the extremely poor, and hired laborers, assistance must be provided to solve their production difficulties. Many problems still remain in the distribution of fruits in many places, such as some cadres and activists retaining too much, some poor and hired soldiers' families, veterans, and demobilized soldiers being allocated too little, outsiders being allocated too little, or outsiders being allocated in two places or misunderstood in two places, some villages having disputes with villages, and even conflicts occurring in the border areas between counties. The existence of these problems still affects the enthusiasm of the masses, affects the relationship between cadres and the masses, and directly affects the development of the large-scale production movement in the future. In addition, even if the newly liberated households are allocated sufficient land, they still face many difficulties in production due to their "weak foundation." If we do not muster our last bit of strength to check and reasonably adjust the distribution of fruits, and if we do not pay attention to the production conditions of the newly liberated households, it will be difficult to organize large-scale production and to combine war service in a more organized manner. Therefore, these outstanding issues must be thoroughly resolved in conjunction with production; at the same time, this is the only way to completely eliminate any gaps that feudal agents can take advantage of.

    [Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 14th] Spring plowing has begun in the entire Jidong area. The Jidong District Committee of the Communist Party of China has issued instructions, emphasizing that the re-examination of land must be combined with spring plowing, and the erroneous concept of waiting must be overcome. Party, government, army, and civilians should be fully mobilized to launch and organize the masses to participate in spring plowing. Attention should be paid to saving manpower, ensuring that agricultural time is not violated, and that not an acre of land is left uncultivated. Farmers are also called upon to boldly cultivate land that has not yet been distributed or whose land rights have not been determined. Even if the land belongs to someone else after cultivation, the government guarantees their due interests. This kind of land can also be collectively cultivated by the farmers' association first, and then distributed later. The Jidong Daily also published an editorial calling for the realization of this year's task of increasing grain production by at least ten catties per mu. The Renan Special District has also called for spring plowing, calling on densely populated areas with river valleys to pay attention to intensive cultivation to ensure increased production, and to plant more cotton and indigo to solve the people's clothing problem. Areas with more land and fewer people should pay attention to eliminating cultivated fallow land. The special commissioner's office has issued a special spring plowing loan of 48 million yuan and 300,000 catties of grain.

　　太行区党委指示
    应大力进行春耕
    结合生产合理调匀土地
    帮助翻身农民解决困难
    不荒寸土
    不闲一人
    【本报特讯】太行某同志谈：目前该区各县群众，正结合解决遗留问题，进行大生产。他说：太行除边地和暂时沦陷区外，一般新老地区，都已基本消灭了封建，实现了耕者有其田。在这基础上，必须结合进行春耕生产。太行区党委日前发给各县的指示，也明确指出：目前大生产运动即将开始，各地应好好讨论中央局“生产指示”，十分注意在农民获得土地的基础上顺利而有力的进行春耕。因此，各地在总结性的思想教育与团结运动中，应结合解决遗留问题布置春耕生产，进行生产教育，发现生产运动各种障碍，通过群众结合政府予以解决。区党委并强调指出：在这当中，应鼓最后一把劲，继续严格检查，与调补果实，尤其是土地的数量质量。已经分到的土地，要经过本人跟看，立了界石，对新翻身的荣退、赤贫、雇工，要帮助其解决生产困难。在果实分配上，很多地方还残留不少问题，如一部分干部积极分子多留，某些贫雇军属荣退军人少分，外来户少分，或外来户两头分或两头误，有些村与村发生纠纷，甚至县与县的边地发生矛盾等等。由于这些问题的存在，仍然影响着群众的热情，影响干群关系，并直接影响今后大生产运动的开展，加之新翻身户即使分到了足够的土地，而由于“底虚”的原故，他们在生产中的困难也还是很多的。如果对果实的分配不鼓最后一把劲，加以检查，合理调剂，如不注意新翻身户生产条件，大规模的组织起来生产，与更有组织的结合战勤，均将发生困难。因此这些遗留问题，必须结合生产彻底解决；同时也才能完全消灭封建特务任何可乘的空隙。（柳）
    【新华社晋察冀十四日电】冀东全区已开始春耕，中共冀东区党委特发出指示，强调复查土地必须与春耕相结合，克服等待的错误观念。党政军民应全体动员起来，发动与组织群众卷入春耕。注意节省民力，作到不违农时，不荒一亩地。并号召农民，对尚未分配和未确定地权的土地，放手去种。即使种后土地属于别人，政府亦保证其应有的利益。此种土地或由农会组织集体先种，然后再分亦可。冀东日报亦发表社论，号召实现今年每亩地至少增产十斤粮食的任务。又热南专区已号召春耕，号召川地人稠地区，注意精耕细作，保证增产，多种棉、蓝，解决人民穿衣问题。地多人少地区则注意消灭熟荒。该专署特发春耕贷款四千八百万元与贷粮三十万斤。
