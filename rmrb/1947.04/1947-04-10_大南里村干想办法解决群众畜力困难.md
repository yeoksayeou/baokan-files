The cadres of Dananli village think of ways to solve the problem of the lack of livestock for the masses.
[This Dispatch from Jinan, Hebei, dated 8th] ＠In Dananli Village, the masses work together for production, and middle peasants help poor peasants buy livestock. In the past, the masses in this village suffered from the oppression of landlords such as Baoyuantang and Cheng Sanbao. Cheng Sanbao colluded with the Chiang Kai-shek government to seize more than 40 hectares of land, accounting for 80% of the village's land. After the masses turned themselves around and overthrew the landlords, each person received at least four mu of land, and those without houses had houses to live in. Zhao Laofeng's family of eleven, originally with twelve mu, received thirty-two mu in the struggle. Cheng Laoming originally had no land; his family of seven received twenty-eight mu. Extreme poverty and poverty have been eliminated in the entire village. However, the first difficulty encountered after the liberation was the lack of livestock for production this year. The village has more than 45 hectares of land, with only 36 head of livestock, large and small. Each animal is responsible for an average of more than 1.2 hectares of land (mostly irrigated land here). Households with livestock feel that the labor burden is too heavy. Today it is his turn to provide labor, and tomorrow it is his turn again. They feel that even with livestock, they cannot do their own work, so they replace the larger ones with smaller ones. Although the village cadres repeatedly advised against it, two were still sold. The masses are very worried about future production. Later, after consultation with the masses, Hu Guangzi, the director of the farmers' association, pooled the floating wealth to buy cattle. Households unwilling to buy cattle contributed money. He also persuaded the middle peasants and well-to-do middle peasants to help the poor peasants with production, lending the proceeds from the fruit to the poor peasants. The village cadres and the director of the farmers' association acted as guarantors and drew up procedures for returning the grain in the autumn. After being persuaded, the middle peasants felt that this was a good thing. On the one hand, it helped the poor peasants with production, and on the other hand, the increased livestock also reduced the burden of labor on the middle peasants. As a result, more than 420,000 yuan was lent to the poor peasants, and thirteen livestock were purchased, solving the livestock difficulties of 31 households. Under this influence, the two households that had previously sold livestock bought livestock again. Currently, the masses in Chen Village are actively organizing mutual aid and carrying out large-scale production.

　　大南里村干想办法解决群众畜力困难
    【本报冀南八日电】＠南大南里村群众合伙搞生产，中农帮助贫农买牲口。该村群众，过去受着保元堂和成三保等几家地主的压迫。成三保勾结蒋家政府霸占土地四十来顷，占本村土地百分之八十，群众翻身后斗倒了地主，每人最少分了四亩地，没房住的有了房子。贫农赵老凤全家十一口人，原有十二亩，斗争中分了三十二亩。成老明原没地，七口人，分得二十八亩。全村已消灭了赤贫和贫农。但翻身后碰到的第一个困难是今年进行生产最缺乏牲畜，全村四十五顷多地，只有大小三十六头牲口，每个牲口平均担负一顷二十多亩地（这里多水浇地），有牲口的户见劳力负担太重，今天支差是他，明天支差又是他，感觉有牲口也做不了自己的活，于是将大的换成小的，虽然村干部一再劝说，但仍然卖掉两个。群众对将来生产很发愁。后来农会主任胡广子给群众商量之后把浮财凑到一块买牛，不愿买牛的户抽出钱去。并说服中农及富裕中农，帮助贫农生产，把果实钱借给贫农。村干部农会主任作保立手续，秋后还粮食。中农经说服后，觉着很好，一面帮助了贫农生产，牲口多了，也减轻了中农支差负担。结果借给贫农四十二万多元，买了十三个牲口，解决了三十一户的牲畜困难。在这样影响下，原先卖牲口的两户，又买了牲口。现陈村群众，正积极组织互助，进行大生产。
