　　Taiyue Supplementary Regiment Recuperation Camp Carries Coal Themselves
  　Saving Over a Thousand Units of Civilian Labor in One Month
    [This newspaper's Taiyue dispatch, 5th] The Taiyue Military Region Supplementary Regiment launched a merit-making campaign, greatly saving civilian labor and enhancing military-civilian unity. After the regiment's recuperation camp moved to a certain location on January 14th of this year, it required more than 90 civilian laborers every day, resulting in significant waste. In late February, the camp commander and political instructor resolved to overcome this negative phenomenon, save civilian labor, and perform meritorious service for the people. They called on all wounded soldiers in the camp to take action themselves to perform meritorious service for the people. The leaders took the lead by carrying coal themselves, setting an example for the camp staff. This exemplary action deeply moved all the convalescing soldiers in the camp. One wounded soldier on crutches said, "We can't carry it, but we can still lift it." In this way, coal carrying became a craze. Currently, except for one seriously wounded company, the other two companies do everything themselves. Civilian labor is only used for long-distance labor such as transporting grain and vegetables. From February 20th to March 25th, this saved 1,033 civilian labor units. They moved the masses and cadres in the village. The village head said, "I'm forty-nine years old, and I've never seen wounded soldiers carrying coal!" The masses also said, "The convalescing soldiers are our own sons and brothers. Quickly help them recover from their injuries and illnesses so they can go and fight Chiang Kai-shek!" As a result, they actively volunteered to carry coal for the camp, carrying back 45,000 jin in just two days. The military-civilian relationship became even closer.

　　太岳补充团休养营自己担炭
  　一月节省民力千余
    【本报太岳五日电】太岳军区补充团开展立功运动，大大节省了民力，增进了军民团结。该团休养营今年元月十四号移驻某地后，每日需用民力九十余个，浪费现象相当严重。二月下旬，该营营长和教导员决心克服此种不良现象，要节省民力，为民立功，并以为民立功号召全营伤员自己动手。首长则以身作则、带领营部工作人员自己担炭。这种模范行动深深感动了全营休养员，有一个扶拐杖的伤员说：“我们不能担，但还可以抬。”这样，担炭形成热潮。现该营除一个重伤连外，其余两个连什么都是自己劳动。仅运粮运菜等远路劳动才用民力。二月二十至三月二十五日，节省民力达一千零三十三个。他们感动了村里群众和干部。村长说：“我活了四十九，没见过伤兵担炭！”群众也说：“休养员是咱们子弟兵，赶快帮助他们把伤病养好去打蒋介石吧！”于是纷纷自动给该营担炭，仅两天即担回四万五千斤。军民关系更加亲热。
