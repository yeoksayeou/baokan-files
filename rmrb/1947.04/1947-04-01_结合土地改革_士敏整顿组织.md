　　Combining Land Reform
    Shi Min Rectifies Organizations
    [This newspaper, Taiyue, 30th dispatch] In the land reform movement, Shi Min strengthened the peasant organizations. The number of peasant association members increased to 26,462, accounting for 38% of the county's population. 577 mass leaders beloved by the peasants emerged. The development process has the following experiences: (1) In the land reform movement, the leadership put forward the policy of organizational construction, that is, paying attention to the development and rectification of peasant organizations during the movement, and examining the lessons of the past that the struggle was separated from the development of organizations. For example, in the third district, after a year of struggle in 1934, the number of peasant association members was still less than 3,000, which made the struggle fruitless. (2) The beginning of brewing the struggle is also the beginning of the development of peasant associations. For example, in the third district, bitter people's groups and turn-over groups were established in the process of complaining about suffering and digging up the roots of poverty, which became the strong backbone of the struggle, and later became the foundation of the peasant association organization. (3) The period when the peasants' revolutionary actions are rising is also the period for rectifying and consolidating their own organizations. For example, in the first and sixth districts, the development of members in the past was not detailed enough, and many landlords disguised themselves and entered the peasant association to escape the struggle. In this great movement, the peasants divided classes and discussed their positions, and these people were purged to consolidate their ranks.

　　结合土地改革
    士敏整顿组织
    【本报太岳三十日电】士敏在土地改革运动中，壮大了农民的组织，农会会员发展到二万六千四百六十二人，占全县人口百分之卅八。并涌现出五百七十七个为农民所爱戴的群众领袖。其发展的过程有如下几点经验：（一）在土地改革运动中，领导上提出了组织建设的方针，即在运动中注意发展整顿农民组织，检查了过去斗争与发展组织脱节的教训。如三区在卅四年经过一年的斗争，农会会员仍不到三千人，使斗争亦无大成绩。（二）酝酿斗争的开始，亦即是农会发展组织的开始。如三区在诉苦挖穷根中建立苦人组、翻身组，为斗争中的坚强骨干，以后亦成为农会组织的基础。（三）农民的革命行动起来时期，亦即是整顿与巩固自己组织的时期。如一、六两区以往发展会员不够细致，不少地主成份伪装进入农会，逃避斗争。在此次大运动中农民划阶级、论立场，这些人都被清洗出去，巩固了自己的阵容。
