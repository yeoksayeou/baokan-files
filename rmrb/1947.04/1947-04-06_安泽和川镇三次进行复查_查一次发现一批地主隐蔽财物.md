　　Anze Hecuan Township Conducts Three Re-Investigations
  　Each Investigation Uncovers a Batch of Landlords' Hidden Wealth
    [This Newspaper's Report] Anze Hecuan Township, after overcoming complacency three times, has seen the re-investigation movement gradually deepen. The village (an old liberated area) has already undergone rent and interest reduction. On March 6th, it launched a total offensive against feudal forces. After ten days of struggle, a total of forty-one households of landlords who were thoroughly liquidated and rich peasants who had their tails cut off. On the surface, it seemed that the feudal forces were defeated decisively, and the fruits of the struggle were abundant. Therefore, some cadres and masses became complacent. "It's almost done! Further searches will be directed at the middle peasants." After the leadership's mobilization, the slogan of resolutely not infringing upon the interests of middle peasants and not leaving any feudal vestiges was put forward. Each *lv* unfolded a door-to-door re-investigation, discovering three small landlord households who had received over fifty *shi* of rent but had never been struggled against; fifteen old rich peasant households with feudal vestiges that had not been completely eradicated. Landlord Gong Tianbao, who received over one hundred *shi* of rent, was once considered to have no substantial wealth, but the struggle unearthed hidden property worth over 300,000 (currency unit unspecified). Cadres felt surprised and thought this would be thorough. However, at the mass meeting, after the cadres mobilized and educated, and called on the basic masses not to conceal property for the landlords, Wang ×× immediately reported that he had hidden over ten *shi* of grain for Gong Tianbao. Niu ××, a landlord and usurer who was considered "struggled against excessively" last year, had hidden silver dollars and other property exposed this year. Recently, another re-investigation movement has been launched. The re-investigation, in just four *lv*, has uncovered four hidden landlords and ten households whose tails were not completely cut off. A careful study of why the feudal forces have not been thoroughly overthrown reveals that: (1) The masses have not been fully mobilized, and there are still serious backward ideas such as "fear of change" and "predestination." Some poor masses are even concealing property for the feudal forces. (2) Individual cadres have not distinguished class lines and are sheltering feudal landlords due to relationships with relatives and friends. (3) Some cadres are bound by policies and have fixed ideas, believing that those who have been struggled against are feudal, and those who have not been struggled against are middle peasants, allowing some landlords to take the opportunity to hide. There is also a mechanical misunderstanding of uniting more than 90% of the peasants. For example, in Six *Lv*, landlords and old rich peasants with feudal vestiges account for 20% of the population. Therefore, they forcibly classify the old rich peasants with feudal vestiges as wealthy middle peasants. (4) Some cadres have a contemptuous attitude toward "backward" masses. An old farmer named Shi Qiucheng did not attend meetings. After mobilization, he still refused to go, saying, "I am destined to be poor, and I will not turn over this time." The cadres stopped trying to mobilize him. According to the investigation in Seven *Lv*, among the 261 basic masses in the entire *lv*, only 134 have been mobilized, accounting for approximately 51.5%. Most of those who have not been mobilized are women. Among the 131 women, only 19 participated in the struggle. For example, the wife of cadre ×××, although she participated in the struggle, told her husband, "We have suffered a lot. We should speak out and take revenge this year, but if we struggle against others, their children and grandchildren will also speak out and take revenge on our children and grandchildren. It's better not to struggle." Therefore, she is not actively pouring out bitterness and digging up the roots of poverty. The "investigation of backwardness" has alerted cadres to their blind complacency. Currently, the township is carrying out a thorough re-investigation movement to conduct a complete liquidation.

　　安泽和川镇三次进行复查
  　查一次发现一批地主隐蔽财物
    【本报讯】安泽和川镇，经过三次克服自满思想，复查运动已逐步深入。该村（系老区）已经过减租减息，三月六日又向封建势力做了总的进攻，经过十天的斗争，彻底清算的地主和割了尾巴的富农共有四十一户。从表面上看，把封建势力打的落花流水，斗争果实也很多，因此有些干部和群众就自满起来了。“差不多啦！再要搜查就搜在中农头上了”。经过领导上的动员，提出坚决不侵犯中农利益，不留一点封建尾巴的号召后，各闾展开了挨门逐户的复查，发现了有三户吃过五十多石租子的小地主，从来没有斗争过；有十五户带封建尾巴的旧富农，没有割彻底。吃一百多石租子的地主弓天保，曾被认为没有大油水，结果斗争出了隐蔽财产共值卅余万。干部感到出乎意外，觉得这一下可彻底了。可是在群众会上，经过干部动员、教育，号召基本群众不给地主隐蔽财产，当下就有王××自动报出给弓天保隐蔽的十余石粮食。去年认为“斗的过火了”的地主兼高利贷的牛××，今年又斗出隐蔽的银洋等财物，最近又开展了一个再查运动。再查中单就四个闾来说，又查出了隐蔽地主四户，割尾巴不彻底的十户。仔细研究封建势力一直未斗透原因是：（一）群众还没有充分的发动起来，还严重的存在着“怕变天”“命造定”等落后思想。还有贫苦群众给封建势力隐蔽财产。（二）个别干部未分清阶级，因亲戚朋友等关系，包庇封建地主。（三）某些干部为政策束缚，有固定的圈子，认为斗过的才是封建，没斗过的就是中农，使一部分地主得以乘机隐蔽。对团结百分之九十以上的农民也有机械的错误了解，如六闾地主与有封建尾巴的旧富农占六闾人口百分之二十，于是硬把带有封建尾巴的旧富农，说成富裕中农。（四）有些干部有轻视“落后”群众的思想，有个老头农民史秋成，不参加开会，经过动员仍不去，并说：“我是命穷，这次我不翻身。”干部也就不再去动员他了。据七闾的调查，全闾基本群众二百六十一人中，发动起来的仅有一百三十四人，约占百分之五十一点五。没有发动起来的多是妇女，妇女一百卅一人中，仅有十九人参加了斗争。如干部×××的老婆虽参加了斗争，还告诉她男人说：“咱受的苦也不少，今年翻身应该诉苦复仇，可是咱斗了人家，到咱儿孙后代时，人家儿孙后代也要诉苦复仇，这冤仇相报，不如不斗好。”因此也就不积极的倒苦水挖穷根了。经过“查落后”，警惕了干部的盲目自满情绪。现该镇正在深入的再查运动中，开展彻底清算。
