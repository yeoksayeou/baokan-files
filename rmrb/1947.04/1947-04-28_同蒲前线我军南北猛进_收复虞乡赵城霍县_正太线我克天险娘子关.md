The Chiang-Yan troops entrenched in these three cities, under the pressure of the People's Liberation Army's power and prestige, fled in panic. The 10th Brigade headquarters of the Chiang army, which had retreated from Linjin to Yongji, had already fled to the south bank of the Yellow River.

Chiang's troops in Yuncheng close the city gates before dark, and the soldiers warn each other: "The Eighth Route Army's field brigade is coming, they're going to eat our weapons!" In order to escape the fate of being annihilated, Chiang's diehards are fleeing one after another. In An邑 County alone, the "Struggle Corps" has fled more than 70 people; in Xia County, the "Struggle Corps" has fled more than 200 people; more diehards have fled in Pinglu County, with more than 200 fleeing from the "Love the Hometown Corps" alone, accounting for two-fifths of the entire corps; in the diehard army's "锐志" unit, the third and fourth companies have also lost sixty or so soldiers; in Linfen, the second company of the engineering battalion of Chiang's New 30th Division lost 31 soldiers in one night.

This newspaper's Taiyue Front, 24th: Jiao Wubao's famous mutual aid group, which kills the enemy, made great contributions in the Qūwò battle. At the beginning of the city attack, Jiao Wubao's mutual aid group had been rushing to the front. The enemy's firepower was extremely fierce, but the group disregarded their own safety, passed through the fire net, and threw several bombs, compressing the enemy in the house. When our main force approached the bunker wall, Jiao Wubao had already rushed to another courtyard. In this battle, Jiao Wubao's group captured a total of 83 enemies and seized 7 machine guns, 58 rifles, and 2 small cannons.
