　　Democratic Government of the Yubei New District Severely Punishes Traitorous Tyrants, Seeking Revenge for the People
　　[Our Newspaper Taihang, 27th Dispatch] The people in the newly liberated Yubei New District have launched a movement to oppose traitors and seek revenge, and to oppose counter-settlements. The local armed forces of Huixian County, in coordination with the main forces, swept away the stubborn Jiang strongholds, capturing more than 150 fleeing traitors, tyrants, and secret agents. The capture team of the Ninth District of Anyang went deep into the east of the Pinghan Railway. From April 14th to 18th, they captured 40 traitors and tyrants who had fled in fear of punishment, and transported back 36,000 catties of grain, 720 catties of cotton, and many other items that had been counter-settled from the masses. On April 18th, Jiji convened a mass meeting near a certain location, attended by representatives from nearby masses and districts and villages throughout the county, to publicly try Liu Yuchun, a major bandit and traitorous tyrant in the county, and Wang Zhenquan, the captain of the "Returning Home Corps." At the meeting, the masses spoke out and demanded that the democratic government severely punish the traitors and tyrants. The county government gave a satisfactory reply and sentenced the traitors and tyrants to death. Note: During the Japanese occupation, Wang Zhiyong served as a Bao head, oppressing and extorting the masses. After the Japanese surrender, he fled in fear of punishment. Last year, when the stubborn Jiang occupied Qugouji, he returned, oppressed the masses, and carried out cruel counter-settlements, committing all kinds of evil.
　　[Our Newspaper Taihang, 27th Dispatch] The newly liberated areas of Anyang and other counties have initially gained some experience in mobilizing the masses:
　　First, dispel ideological concerns. Some masses were afraid that the democratic government would not trust them. Before the stubborn army was defeated, the Jiang special agents shamelessly spread rumors saying: "Last time when the Eighth Route Army retreated to the west, you didn't follow. This time, the Eighth Route Army is different from the past. They say you worked for us and won't trust you anymore." This rumor also had some effect. Secondly, there was fear of retaliation from village cadres. Some village cadres who withdrew with the army last year suffered losses in their homes, and some masses were afraid that the village cadres would suspect them of reporting, causing misunderstandings. In addition, there was fear of "changing the sky." Based on the above situation, the returned cadres (especially village cadres) first visited households, expressing their attitude very kindly and sincerely, explaining that the Eighth Route Army's policy for the masses would never change, sympathizing with their painful lives under the oppression of the stubborn Jiang, and explaining that some village cadres' homes suffered losses due to the stubborn army and the "Returning Home Corps," and the masses should not be blamed. Secondly, using local examples to illustrate the comparison of strength between our army and the Jiang army, the war situation has undergone great changes, so as to eliminate the masses' concerns and inspire their courage to fight for revenge.
　　Second, seize the masses' enthusiasm for opposing traitors and seeking revenge. While participating in the war, carry out sabotage, conduct grievance sessions, and conduct struggles in a timely manner. The returned village cadres and militiamen must pay attention to discovering new activists and absorb them into the leading group to strengthen the mass struggle camp. (Jianye)
　　[Our Newspaper Taihang, 27th Dispatch] The Anyang Democratic Government has allocated a large amount of grain and funds to relieve the people in the newly recovered areas. In the past, the stubborn Jiang frantically extorted taxes in their occupied areas, causing the people to fall into serious famine. In Shuiye, which suffered more than five months of devastation by the Jiang army, a large number of beggars wandered the streets. Our democratic government has allocated 80,000 catties of grain and 800,000 catties of coal for distribution to poor refugees. In addition, low-interest loans of 6 million yuan have been issued to restore the rural economy and stabilize people's lives.
　　[Yubei Front, 27th Dispatch] The Catholic Church on East Street in Hua County held a regular service on the morning after the People's Liberation Army recovered the city (20th). On the same day, Li Jingyi, commander of the Fourth Sub-district of the Jiluyu Military Region, visited Father Ai Wenhua. Father Ai was extremely honored and accompanied him to visit all parts of the church, praising the strict discipline of the People's Liberation Army after entering the city. He expressed his heartfelt gratitude for posting notices to protect the church. Father Ai is Italian, 62 years old, and has been preaching in Hua County for 32 years. He said that during the Jiang army's occupation of Hua County, the people's burden was extremely heavy, and they missed the Communist Party and the democratic government day and night. When the Jiang army fled, they captured more than 200 young men, many of whom were Catholic believers. He believes that the Jiang army's methods are very despicable. (Wu Xiang)

　　豫北新区民主政府严惩奸霸为民复仇
    【本报太行二十七日电】豫北新区重获解放的人民，掀起了反奸复仇、反倒算运动。辉县地方武装配合大军横扫蒋顽据点，俘虏逃亡奸霸特务一百五十余人。安阳九区捕捉队深入平汉路东，由四月十四日到十八日，共捉回畏罪潜逃之奸霸四十名，并运回群众被倒算之粮食三万六千斤、棉花七百二十斤及其他东西甚多。四月十八日，汲淇于某地召集附近群众及全县区村代表大会，公审本县大土匪大奸霸刘玉春及“还乡团”队长王振全，会上群众纷纷诉苦要求民主政府严惩奸霸。县府圆满答复，当将该奸霸等判处死刑。十九日，安阳曲沟集十二村一千五百余人集会，斗争“还乡团”头子王志永，县政府根据群众要求，亦处以死刑。按：该王志永在日寇时代，曾为保长，欺压讹诈群众；日寇投降后即惧罪潜逃，去年蒋顽占我曲沟集，该逆又行返回，压迫群众，残酷倒算，无恶不作。
    【本报太行二十七日电】：安阳等县重获解放之新区，已初步取得一些发动群众的经验：
    第一，解除思想顾虑。有些群众怕民主政府不相信他们，顽军溃败前蒋特无耻造谣说：“上次八路军往西退时，你们没有跟上退，这一回八路军过来可和过去不一样了，说你们给我们办事，不会再相信你们了。”这种谣言也起了一些作用。其次，是怕村干部报复。去年随军退出之村干部，有的家中受了损失，有些群众害怕村干部怀疑是他们报告的，对自己发生误会。另外，就是怕“变天”。根据以上情况，各地返回之干部（特别是村干部），首先是挨户访问，很和气很诚恳的表明态度，说明八路军为群众的政策永远不变，同情他们在蒋顽压榨下的痛苦生活，并说明有些村干部家里受了损失，是顽军与“还乡团”干的，不能怨群众。其次，用本地实例，说明我军与蒋军力量的对比，战局已经起了很大的变化，这样来消除群众的顾虑并启发其复仇斗争的勇气。
    第二，抓紧群众要求反奸复仇的热气，在参战中一面进行破击，一面进行诉苦串通，及时进行斗争。并须返回之村干部及民兵注意发现新的积极分子，并大量吸收到领导集团中来，以壮大群众斗争的阵营。（建业）
    【本报太行二十七日电】安阳民主政府拨出大量粮款救济新收复区人民。蒋顽过去在其统治区疯狂勒索，使人民陷于严重灾荒。遭受蒋军五个多月蹂躏之水冶，大批乞丐流浪街头。我民主政府特拨粮食八万斤，煤八十万斤，分发贫苦难民。另外，又发放低利贷款六百万元，以恢复农村经济，安定人民生活。
    【豫北前线二十七日电】滑县东街天主教堂于人民解放军收复该城之次晨，（二十日）照常举行礼拜仪式。同日午冀鲁豫军区第四分区司令员李静宜，往访神父艾文华，艾神父引为极大荣幸，陪同参观教堂各处，并盛赞人民解放军入城后的严明纪律。对张贴布告保护教堂一举，表示衷心感谢。艾神父意大利人，现年六十二岁，在滑传教已三十二年。渠称蒋军侵占滑县期间，人民负担奇重，日夜思念共产党与民主政府。蒋军逃窜时抓走壮丁二百余，其中有不少天主教教友。渠认为蒋军此种手段甚为卑鄙。（吴象）
