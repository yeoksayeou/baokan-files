Xinhua News Agency, Northern Section of the Pinghan Railway Front, Urgent Telegram, 13th: To coordinate with the Northwest People's Liberation Army in defending Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia and defending Chairman Mao, the Jin-Cha-Ji People's Liberation Army launched a counter-offensive against the Chiang Kai-shek troops around Shijiazhuang, annihilating over 10,000 enemies. The offensive began at midnight on the 9th of this month. On the evening of the 11th, Luancheng, 60 miles southeast of Shijiazhuang, was liberated. At 8:00 AM on the 12th, Zhengding, a key town 30 miles northeast of Shijiazhuang on the northern section of the Pinghan Railway, and over 60 stations and strongholds, including Baoyu and Gaoqian (between Shijiazhuang and Yuanshi), were liberated. The Zhengtai Railway between Jingxing and Huolu was also cut off. According to preliminary statistics, over 10,000 troops from Hu Zongnan's 3rd Army and the puppet army of Hou Ruyong were annihilated. The battle is raging fiercely.

Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 13th: Local armed forces in the southern Shandong mountainous area achieved three victories in five days, killing or wounding nearly 1,000 Chiang Kai-shek troops who were "suppressing bandits" in the area. On the 5th, Chiang Kai-shek troops who had invaded Baiyan advanced towards Doushan in the northeast, and were fiercely counterattacked by local armed forces, with over 200 enemies killed or wounded. At 3:00 AM on the night of the 6th, a lightly armed unit of over 500 men from the 11th Division of the Chiang Kai-shek army in Bianqiao, west of Sishui, attempted to突击 the People's Liberation Army garrison. They were ambushed by local armed forces pre-positioned there, and pursued for more than 20 miles, resulting in over 130 Chiang Kai-shek troops killed or wounded, and over 170 captured alive. The next morning, over 400 of these Chiang Kai-shek troops attacked eastward and were surrounded by another unit of local armed forces. After three hours of fierce fighting, over 250 Chiang Kai-shek troops, including a battalion commander, were captured alive, and 180 were killed or wounded. Ten light machine guns, one 60mm mortar, 80 rifles, and over 10,000 rounds of ammunition were seized.

Xinhua News Agency, Eastern China Front, 11th: Various units of the East China People's Liberation Army are currently engaged in a training upsurge. In the "Guizhou" unit, the 11th Detachment's heavy machine gun company has learned all kinds of machine gun repair and adjustment techniques in three weeks. They have become more proficient in selecting positions, coordinating with infantry, and shooting at various targets. Zhan Qinchen and Li Jinpan, two soldiers, can disassemble and reassemble a machine gun with their eyes closed in eleven minutes. The average speed of the whole company is sixteen minutes and twenty-five seconds. They study nighttime aiming, often until midnight, some even until dawn. Company commander Wang Laifu frequently discusses techniques with skilled soldiers and personally teaches other soldiers. Deputy Regimental Commander Li also personally studies night shooting with the company. In the "Fuzhou" unit's training efforts, a company of a certain regiment adopted the "little teacher" method, discovering each person's strengths and democratically electing little teachers. For example, Huang Han, a soldier in the first squad of a certain company, scored 28 rings in shooting and was elected as a shooting instructor. Shen Yongcheng can throw a grenade 50 meters and was selected as a grenade throwing instructor. In addition, there are also political, combat, bayonet fighting, cultural, unity, and hygiene instructors. They put forward the slogan "Learn from each other's strengths, work hard, and learn skills to annihilate the Chiang Kai-shek troops!" (Attached picture)
