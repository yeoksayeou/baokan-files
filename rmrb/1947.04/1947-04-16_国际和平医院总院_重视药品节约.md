　　International Peace Hospital General Hospital
    Emphasizes Drug Conservation
    [This newspaper reports] The General Hospital of the Border Region's International Peace Hospital has launched a "drug saving" production campaign. Political Commissar Cai pointed out at the meeting: Hospital conservation should be more important than production, and public conservation should be more important than personal conservation. According to statistics, each person saved 12,781 jin of millet in cotton clothes, single clothes, shoes, socks, and towels (total number of people is 151, excluding the nursing school). The most savings came from Section Chief Miao of the General Affairs Section, who saved 334 jin of rice, all handed over to the public. At the same time, the hospital convened a special drug saving meeting to study how to save drugs and equipment and avoid waste. For example, it was proposed to use saline instead of borax water, and to treat malaria thoroughly, taking enough medicine according to the rules to avoid repeated attacks and waste. More physical therapy methods should be adopted, such as hot and cold compresses, to reduce the amount of drugs used, and a strict property management system and inspection system should be implemented to avoid damage to equipment. It was also proposed to hand over the remaining soap heads from hand washing to the pharmacy for enemas. Sesame oil has also been used to replace imported tar for viewing microscopes, among other methods. In addition, everyone is not slackening in production because of "exemption from tasks." Male and female students of the nursing school used two and a half days of free time to chop 4,503 jin of firewood and sew 200 buttonholes. Director Chang of the Nursing Department discovered a fire on the mountain late at night, and quickly led five students, groping along several miles of dark road to the mountain to put out the fire, preserving the firewood. Taking advantage of a Sunday, except for a few comrades who stayed at home to maintain work, Political Commissar Cai and Deputy Director Hong personally led all personnel to open up wasteland on a mountain five miles away. In just eight hours, they opened up two large hillsides of about 30 mu, preparing to plant potatoes. Political Commissar Cai, hobbling on a wooden leg, could not climb the mountain, so he personally organized female comrades at the foot of the mountain to collect firewood and boil water, ensuring that there was boiled water to drink at any time.

    [This newspaper's Hebei-South fourteenth dispatch] The Fifth Surgical Department of the Peace Hospital of the Hebei-South Military Region, under the leadership of Comrades Yu Guanling and Ping Jinan, saved a large amount of medical materials. This unit was supposed to receive 1,270 liang of gauze, 1,950 liang of cotton, 1,755 square feet of white cloth, and 1,170 liang of alcohol in two months. At the end of February, the settlement of various materials saved reached two-thirds, totaling 690 liang of gauze, 1,550 liang of cotton, 1,195 square feet of white cloth, and 810 liang of alcohol. Despite the large amount of savings, the use and hygiene of the wounded were still guaranteed. Their method of use is: one square foot of gauze is cut into four squares (slightly larger than in the past, as it was too small to wash in the past), along with bandages and cotton, which are replaced after use, washed, disinfected, and reused, so that nothing is wasted.

　　国际和平医院总院
    重视药品节约
    【本报讯】边区国际和平医院总院展开“节药”生产运动。蔡政委在大会上指出：医院节约应重于生产，公共节约应重于个人节约。据统计，每人棉衣、单衣、鞋袜毛巾等，就节约了一万二千七百八十一斤小米（总人数一五一人，护士学校尚不计在内），节约最多的是总务科苗科员，三百三十四斤米，全部交公。同时，院方特召集了节药会议，专门研究如何节省药品器材，避免浪费。如提出用盐水代替硼砂水，治疟疾要治就治彻底，按规矩吃够量，免得屡次发作，反而浪费。多采用理学疗法，如热敷冷敷等以减少药品的用量，并严格财产保管制度及检查制度，以免器械的损坏。又提出将洗手剩下的肥皂头交药房作灌肠用。并已用香油代替舶来品柏油来看显微镜等办法。此外，生产方面，大家也不因“免交任务”而松懈。护士学校男女同学利用两个半天的空暇，砍柴四千五百零三斤，锁扣眼二百件。护士部常主任深夜发现山上着火，急忙带了五个同学，摸了几里黑路上山将火扑灭，保留下了柴。并利用一个星期日，除少数同志在家维持工作外，由蔡政委、洪副院长亲自带领全体人员，到八里路外的山上开荒，仅八小时内开了两个大山坡约三十亩，预备种山药蛋。蔡政委拐着一条木腿，上不了山，亲自在山下组织女同志拾柴烧开水，作到了随时有开水喝。

    【本报冀南十四日电】冀南军区和平医院五所外科室，在玉冠岭、平金安二同志领导下，节约大量医用材料。该部两个月应领纱布一千二百七十两，棉花一千九百五十两，白布一千七百五十五方尺，和酒一千一百七十两。二月底结算各项材料节约均达三分之二，计纱布六百九十两，棉花一千五百五十两，白布一千一百九十五方尺，酒八百一十两。虽经大量节约，但仍保证了伤员们的使用和卫生。他们的使用方法是：纱布一方尺剪成四方块（比过去大一些，过去小了不能洗），连同绷带棉花，用后换下，洗净消毒，继续再用，作到一点也不浪费。
