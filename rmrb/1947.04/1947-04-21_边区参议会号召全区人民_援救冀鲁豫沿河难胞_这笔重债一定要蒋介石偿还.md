    [Special Dispatch from this Newspaper] The Border Region Assembly, in order to call on the entire region to support the rapid construction of the Yellow River dikes and shatter Chiang Kai-shek's plot to flood our region, has issued a letter to all compatriots in the region. The full text is as follows:
    To all elders and compatriots in the entire border region:
    This Assembly, in order to stop Chiang Kai-shek's monstrous crime of flooding our region and to aid the seven million compatriots on both sides of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan border, has issued a telegram (published in the March 15th People's Daily) to the entire country to accuse and appeal, which I believe has been noted. Regarding the issue of the Yellow River returning to its old course, the people of our region have been running around and appealing for the past year, exhausting their strength and hoarsening their voices. The righteous people of the entire country have expressed warm sympathy and support. If Chiang Kai-shek had even a little humanity, he would not have risked the world's condemnation and disregarded the lives and property of millions of people. Unexpectedly, with the full support of UNRRA, he tore up all previous agreements and promises and recklessly closed the gap on the fifteenth of last month. The Yellow River has completely flowed into its old course, and hundreds of villages and countless fields, houses, grain, and furniture downstream that had not been moved have been swept away! The residents on both sides are terrified of the impending disaster, running around and crying out, which is extremely tragic! Chiang Kai-shek continues to disrupt and sabotage the rescue and dike construction work on both sides with large armies and aircraft, causing the dikes we newly built last year to be fragmented and riddled with dangerous points. The peach blossom flood season is now upon us, and everywhere is already in a precarious state. The danger will be even more unimaginable when the main flood season arrives. In addition, many of the famous Jin Dikes, which protect western Shandong and southern Hebei, are also damaged. Once the flood breaks through, the plains will inevitably be submerged, and more than ten million people will be displaced and drowned. Therefore, it is extremely necessary to build dikes in a timely manner. The south bank is currently occupied by Chiang's troops, and although our government is even more concerned, it cannot organize construction and material assistance is also quite difficult. It is hoped that the local compatriots will fight desperately with Chiang's bandits and do as much as possible. The north bank should be vigorously organized by the government, and construction should be started as soon as possible without hindering the spring plowing and production of the people. However, the project is huge and requires a lot of talent. In terms of labor alone, the north bank and Jin Dike need three to four million people. Such a large amount of manpower and financial resources is beyond the reach of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region, which has been brutally ravaged by Chiang's troops for a long time, and the border budget is also difficult to supplement. The colleagues of this Assembly and the authorities of the Border Region Government have racked their brains and found no solution. As a last resort, we can only rely on the joint assistance of the entire region. I believe that our compatriots in the entire region share weal and woe and are in the same boat. For this urgent need to prevent disasters, save lives, and shatter Chiang's plot, they will be able to lend a helping hand and generously provide assistance. But compatriots should remember: "Grievances have their source, and debts have their debtor." We must denounce the creators of the Yellow River disaster, and hold Chiang Kai-shek and UNRRA responsible for repaying this heavy debt. We will not stop until we achieve our goal. Urgent words, I hope you will understand!

    边区参议会号召全区人民
    援救冀鲁豫沿河难胞
    这笔重债一定要蒋介石偿还
    【本报特讯】边区参议会为号召全区支援尽速修筑黄河堤坝粉碎蒋贼水淹我区阴谋，发表告全区同胞书，全文如下：全边区父老同胞：
    本会为制止蒋介石水淹我区之滔天罪行，援救冀鲁豫两岸七百万同胞，曾通电（登载三月十五日人民日报）向全国控诉呼吁，谅邀鉴及矣。查一年来本区人民为黄河归故问题，奔走呼号，已力竭声嘶，全国正义人士热烈同情声援，蒋介石苟稍具人心，当不至冒天下之大不韪，置数百万生灵财产于不顾。不谓狼子野心，绝灭人性，竟赖联总之全力支援，撕破历次之协议诺言，不顾一切，悍然于上月十五日堵死口门矣。黄河已全部流入故道，下游未及迁移之数百村庄及无数田园、庐舍、粮食、家具尽付东流！两岸居民怵大祸之降临，奔走呼号，厥壮至惨！而蒋介石仍不断以大军及飞机扰乱，破坏两岸之抢险筑堤工作，致去岁我新筑之堤岸亦陷破碎支离，险工迭出。现届桃汛，已到处岌岌可危，以后伏汛到来，危险更难想像，加之屏障鲁西冀南之著名金堤亦多残破，一旦洪流溃决，将不免平原陆沉，千余万人民流离灭顶。因此，及时修筑堤坝，实为万分必要之举。南岸现为蒋军盘据，我政府虽关怀更深，但无法组织进行，物质接济亦颇困难，尚望当地同胞与蒋贼拚命力争，尽可能去作。北岸则应由政府大力组织，在不误人民春耕生产条件下尽速兴工。惟工程浩大，需才孔多，以人工一项而论，仅北岸及金堤即需三四百万，如此大量之人力财力需要，若出诸久经蒋军残酷蹂躏的冀鲁豫区。实属力有未逮，而边款预算又复难以挹注。本会同仁与边区政府当局辗转焦思，无以为计，万不得已，惟有赖全区合力协济之一途。想我全区同胞患难与共，谊切同舟，对此防灾救命粉碎蒋贼阴谋之急需，当能不吝援手，慨然予以借助。但同胞们应记着：“冤有头债有主”，我们要对制造黄灾者声讨，对此抢救灾重债要蒋介石及联总负责偿还，不达目的誓不休止。迫切陈词，伏维鉴察是荷！
