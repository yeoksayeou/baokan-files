　　Taiyue "First Battalion" Combat Review
    Democratic Discussion and Evaluation of Merits
    [Our Newspaper Taiyue Frontline Fourteenth Dispatch] After the Houma battle, the Second Company of the "First Battalion" launched a warm combat review and merit evaluation. Various leaders went deep into the squads and platoons to listen to the opinions of the combatants. All the comrades of the Fifth Squad unanimously felt that the reason for the victory in this attack was the good arrangement and organization of the higher authorities, especially the battalion and company commanders. After the departure, they did not have a moment of leisure. After entering the position, they did not even bother to eat, and repeatedly reconnoitered personally at a distance of a dozen meters from the enemy, researching and discussing. The political instructor was always with the combatants day and night, rehearsing combat, checking combat preparations, and personally supervising and encouraging everyone on the battlefield. All the soldiers of the Fifth Squad proposed to award each battalion and company leader a citation. In addition, they mentioned three comrades from the Engineer Company, who studied methods based on their tasks on the battlefield and bravely completed the blasting mission, allowing everyone to safely break into the city. They proposed that the higher authorities award each of the three engineer comrades a citation. Everyone also unanimously recognized that without the close coordination of various firepower, it would not be possible to successfully attack. Therefore, Battalion Commander Liu Cunhou personally wrote three letters expressing deep respect to the mountain artillery battalion, the engineer company, the mortar company and other units, stating that only our close cooperation can make every battle to defend Chairman Mao a victory.
    [Our Newspaper Tongpu Frontline Thirteenth Dispatch] In the Jicheng liberation battle, the cooks of the Taishan 402nd unit also launched a merit-earning campaign, which greatly improved the lives of the troops. From the 4th to the 6th, the unit had more than a dozen kinds of food, and the dishes were improved as much as possible in terms of quality. Although it was very difficult on the front line, they could eat tofu, vermicelli, vegetables and even eggs every day, ensuring two meals of steamed buns and one meal of porridge a day, and delivering water three times. The cooks traveled sixteen miles each time they delivered food and water, but they had no complaints.

　　太岳“一营”战斗检讨
    民主讨论评定功劳
    【本报太岳前线十四日电】侯马战斗后，“一营”二中队展开了热烈的战斗检讨与评功。各首长分头深入班排，倾听战斗员意见。五小队全体同志一致感到此次攻击胜利的原因，是上级布置组织的好，尤其是营连长，出发后就没有一点闲空，进入阵地后，连饭也顾不上吃，不断的在离敌十几公尺的地方亲自三番四复的侦察，研究讨论。教育员总是昼夜不息的和战斗员在一起演习战斗、检查战斗准备，在战场上亲自督促、鼓动大家。五小队全体战士提出给营连首长每人记一功。另外，他们提到工兵连三个同志，在战场上根据任务研究办法，英勇完成了爆破任务，使大家安全的突进城去。提议上级给三位工兵同志各记一功。大家又都一致认识到没有各种火力配合好，是不能顺利攻进去的。因此营长刘存厚亲自给山炮大队工兵连、迫击炮连等单位写了三封深表敬意的信，说明只有我们亲密的配合，才能使保卫毛主席的每一战争取得胜利。
    【本报同蒲前线十三日电】泰山四○二部队在冀城光复战中，炊事员们也展开立功运动，大大改善了部队生活。四日至六日三天中，该部吃饭的花样有十余种，菜也尽量求得质量提高。虽然火线上很困难，但每日均可吃到豆腐、粉条、青菜甚至鸡蛋，保证一天吃到两顿馍，一顿稀饭，送水三回。送饭送水每次往返十六里，但炊事员毫无怨言。
