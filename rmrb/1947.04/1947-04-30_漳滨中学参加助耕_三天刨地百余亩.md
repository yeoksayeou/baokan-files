　　Zhangbin Middle School Participates in Helping with Farming
　　Three Days Plowing Over a Hundred Mu

　　[This newspaper, Taihang News] On April 22nd, Zhangbin Middle School proposed to help the military families stationed in the village with spring plowing. Male and female students from four classes, more than 130 people, enthusiastically and voluntarily signed up to participate. Mr. Wang Fuzhen and Mr. Li Zhenggan also participated. In terms of division of labor, the older students plowed the hillside, the younger students hoed the wheat seedlings, and the female students delivered food. The students' enthusiasm was very high. In three days of intense labor, they plowed more than 130 mu of land and hoed more than 30 mu of wheat. During the labor, they did not mind fatigue, some had their backs sunburned, and some had blisters on their hands. During the labor, the masses were very moved and sent steamed buns, cigarettes, etc. to the students in the field... all of which were rejected by the students. The mass cadres all said: "The middle school lives in our village, which has solved a major problem." (Wen He, Zi An, Zhong Min)

　　漳滨中学参加助耕
    三天刨地百余亩
    【本报太行讯】漳滨中学四月二十二日提出帮助驻村军属春耕，四个班男女同学，一百三十多人均踊跃自动报名参加，王福臻、李贞干二先生也参加。在分工上，大同学刨坡地，小同学锄麦苗，女同学送饭，同学们情绪十分高涨。在三天的紧张劳动中，刨了一百三十多亩地，锄了三十多亩麦子。在劳动中不嫌疲劳，有的把脊背晒红，有的摩到手上泡。在劳动中群众很受感动，给学生们往地里送馍纸烟等……一律被同学拒绝了。群众干部都说：“中学在咱村住，可解决了大困难。”（文和、子安、中民）
