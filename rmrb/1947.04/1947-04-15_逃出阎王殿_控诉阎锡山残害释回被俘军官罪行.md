Escape from the Palace of Hell
Accusation of Yan Xishan's Atrocities Against Released Captured Military Officers
Xu Shuangyin

Xu Shuangyin, from Hebei, once served as an upper lieutenant and company commander of the 5th Company, 3rd Battalion of the Rescue Detachment of the 61st Army of the Jin-Sui Army. During the Shangdang Campaign in the autumn of the 34th year of the Republic of China (1945), he laid down his arms in Huguan City and later studied in the Taihang Military Officer Training Group. In the summer of the 35th year, he was released when our army released a large number of captured military officers. Recently, he escaped to the Liberated Area. This article accuses Yan Xishan of his crimes against the released prisoners of war.

Last summer, we, the more than 800 captured officers of the rank of school and lieutenant during the Shangdang Campaign, were leniently released by the Eighth Route Army. On the second day of the Dragon Boat Festival, we returned to Taiyuan and lived in Xiaoyingpan outside the North Gate. Under the strict supervision of "cadres" and sentries, we were not allowed to leave the area even a step.

Four days after returning to Taiyuan, a training camp was established. As the training began, so did the terror. They first brought up the so-called "pouring out grievances movement." In fact, what grievances did we have to tell? If we had to say something, it would only be the Eighth Route Army's leniency and preferential treatment towards us. We couldn't repay kindness with malice, so no one spoke. So they used all kinds of soft and hard tactics to coax us. The first step was to have each person write out the details of their experience in the Eighth Route Army, saying that nothing should be missed, otherwise, if someone "broke through," they would be severely punished. And they wrote it again and again.

The second step was to have five cadres from the team conduct individual talks repeatedly and in turns. During the talks, they would take out fake notes to intimidate us, saying that someone had "broken through" you with notes. Writing and talking like this, sooner or later some verbal contradictions would inevitably occur, and they would look for loopholes in these contradictions.

The third step was to carry out self-criticism. There was self-criticism in the class, self-criticism in the team, and self-criticism in the regiment. Once it came to regiment self-criticism, there was only one way to die.

The first person to be brought up for regiment self-criticism was Yang Shuchen, a native of Anyang, Henan. He was 31 years old at the time and had served as a second lieutenant platoon leader in the 3rd Battalion of the 205th Regiment of the 61st Army. He laid down his arms in Huguan in August of the 34th year. When he was studying in the Taihang Military Officer Training Group, he had said that he had been tied up by Yan's army and forced into military service in Shanxi. This was the very reason he was the first to be brought up for regiment self-criticism. After being brought up, he said generously, "Several people have attacked me on this point. Yes, I said it because that was my personal experience." In the end, Yang Shuchen's fate was decided by a show of hands. All those "Iron Army" villains shouted, "Shoot him," "Commit suicide," "Beat him to death with clubs"..., and the result was to tell him to "commit suicide." Who would dare not raise their hands according to their wishes at this time? After the vote, a villain suddenly stood up and said, "He should be paraded with a tall hat before being told to commit suicide." The next day, Yang Shuchen was indeed made to wear a two-foot-high paper hat and paraded around the camp. Then Yang Shuchen was ordered to stand still, and all the trainees of the training camp were ordered to form two columns and walk past where Yang was standing, forcing everyone to spit hard on his face. On the third day, Yang Shuchen was taken into the city by car to "commit suicide."

After Yang Shuchen "committed suicide," for more than twenty consecutive days, there was team self-criticism in the morning and regiment self-criticism in the afternoon, and at least two or three people died every day.

Throughout the regiment self-criticism process, their methods of dealing with people were also very varied and extremely cruel. The most common were: kneeling punishment, fasting, confinement, shooting, "suicide," beating to death with clubs... Those who were punished to kneel were told to kneel before Yan Xishan's portrait. The lighter cases knelt for three days, while the heavier cases knelt for two weeks. Confinement was for one month for the lighter cases and one year for the heavier cases. Those who were confined were organized into a team of more than one hundred people and confined within the camp. More than a dozen were taken to the city prison for confinement, saying that "they would be released when the Eighth Route Army was completely wiped out." Everyone knew that this was a life sentence. Therefore, before leaving, some secretly said, "If Grandpa Eight (referring to the Eighth Route Army) doesn't come, we won't get out. You don't hope for it, but we do." More than twenty people, including Zhao Zirong, were shot. One night, one person felt too stuffy in the class, so he went outside alone. Later, it was insisted that he was trying to escape, and he was shot that night.

More than twenty people "committed suicide." They were all taken by car to a specially set up "suicide yard" in the city. Each house in the yard contained three items: a short sword, a basin of poison, and a pistol. The "suicide" person would choose one and "commit suicide" within a limited time. When the time was up, they would enter the room to collect the body.

Beating to death with clubs was the most tragic. More than thirty people, including Du Changhe (a native of Henan, sergeant communicator of the 3rd Battalion of the 198th Regiment of the 66th Division, captured in Mopannao), were beaten to death with clubs. When beating, those "Iron Army" villains deliberately did not kill them immediately, but hit them with more than two hundred blows, all over the body, breaking the skin and bleeding everywhere, before letting them slowly die.

The regiment self-criticism meeting was so terrifying and cruel that two people died of anger at the meeting; three fainted from anger and finally died after being carried back to their classes. Three others went mad. A doctor from the 7th team shouted in extreme anger, "No one died in the Eighth Route Army for more than half a year. We were completely released, but as soon as we returned to the Second War Zone, we were told to die, and even beaten to death alive! Don't you understand which is better?" As a result, he was immediately confined and later starved to death in the confinement room. In addition, more than ten people managed to escape.

I am now a survivor and have safely escaped to the Liberated Area again. I hope that my comrades who have not yet escaped will quickly find a way to escape. At the same time, I hope that all democratic people in the country will rise up and quickly end the dark rule of Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan to save these young people!

　　逃出阎王殿
    控诉阎锡山残害释回被俘军官罪行
    徐双银
    徐双银，河北人，曾任晋绥军六十一军解救支队三大队五中队上尉中队长。三十四年秋上党战役时，在壶关城放下武器，后入我太行军官教导团学习，于三十五年夏，我军大批释放被俘军官时放回。近又逃来解放区。这篇文章控诉了阎锡山残害被释俘虏军官的罪状。
    ——编者
    我们在上党战役被俘的八百多校尉级军官，于去年夏天，被八路军宽大释放。端阳节的第二天，我们回到了太原，住在北门外小营盘。在“干部”和岗哨严密监视下，不让出门一步。
    回太原后的第四天，成立了集训团。集训开始了，恐怖也就开始了。他们首先提出所谓“倒苦水运动”。其实我们有什么苦处可说呢？要说的话，就只有八路军对我们的宽大和优待。我们不能以怨报德，所以就没有人说。于是他们用尽各种软硬办法来哄。第一步，要每一个人写出自己在八路军中的经过详情，说是一点也不要漏，不然有人“突击”出来了，就要严厉处置。而且写了又写。
    第二步，由队上五个干部，轮番地重复地进行个别谈话。谈话时，拿出假条子来吓诈，说是有人用条子“突击”你。这样写来写去，谈来谈去，先后难免会发生一些言语上的矛盾，他们就在这矛盾中找岔子。
    第三步，实行检讨。有班检讨，队检讨，团检讨。一到团检讨，就只有死路一条。
    第一个被提到团检讨的，叫杨树臣，河南安阳人，当时三十一岁，曾在六十一军二○五团三营当过少尉排长，三十四年八月在壶关放下武器。他在太行军官教导团学习时，曾说过他自己被阎军捆到山西当兵的情形。就是这一条，把他第一个提到了团检讨。被提出后，他很慷慨的说。“好几个人都突击我这一条，是的，我说过，因为那是我亲身经历的事实。”最后对杨树臣的处置，实行举手表决。只见那些“铁军”坏蛋们，乱嚷“枪毙”、“自裁”、“乱棍打死”…………，结果叫他“自裁”。这时谁敢不照他们的意思举手表决呢？表决之后，忽然又有一个坏蛋站起来说：“要把他戴高帽游行一次，再叫他去自裁”。到了第二天，果然把杨树臣戴了一个二尺高的纸帽子，在营盘内游行了一遍。然后让杨树臣呆呆站定，命令全集训团的学员们排成二路纵队，从杨站着的地方走过，逼着每个人都要朝他的脸上狠狠吐一口唾沫。到了第三天，才用汽车把杨树臣押进城内去“自裁”了。
    自杨树臣“自裁”后，一连二十多天，每天上午队检讨，下午团检讨，天天至少要死两三个人。
    在整个团检讨过程中，他们处置人的办法，也是花样很多，极尽残酷的能事。最常见的是：罚跪、绝食、禁闭、枪毙、“自裁”、乱棍打死…………。罚跪的，是叫跪在阎锡山的像前，轻者跪三天，重者有跪两个礼拜的。禁闭，轻者一月，重者一年。被禁闭的，编了一个队，共有一百多人，禁闭在营盘内。还有十来个，被押进城内监狱里去禁闭了，说是“什么时候把八路军消灭完，什么时候就放他们出来”。谁都知道，那就是无期徒刑，因此，临行前有人暗暗地说：“八大爷（指八路军）不来就出不来，你们不盼我们盼。”被枪毙的有赵子荣等二十多人。有一个，是在一个晚上，他在班内觉得太闷热了，于是一个人走出室外去了。后来硬说他是企图逃跑，当夜就把他枪毙了。
    被“自裁”的，有二十多人，都是用汽车押进城内专设的一个“自裁院”，院内每个房子放有三件东西：一把短剑，一盆毒药，一支手枪。由“自裁”者自择一种，在限定的时间内实行“自裁”，到了时间就进房要尸体。
    乱棍打死，是最惨的一种。被乱棍打死的，有杜长河（河南人，六十六师一九八团三营营部传达上士，在磨盘瑙被俘）等三十多人。打时，那些“铁军”坏蛋们，故意不马上打死，你一棍，我一棍，狠狠的要打二百多棍，浑身都打遍，到处都打得皮破血流，才让他慢慢死去。
    团检讨大会，是那样恐怖残忍，所以在大会上气死了两个；有三个气晕后，抬回班上也最后死去了。还有三个发疯了。七队有个医生在极端气愤中大骂道：“在八路军半年多，没有死一个，完全释放回来了，一回到二战区，倒要叫人死，还要活活打死！究竟那里好，还不明白吗？”因此马上便把他禁闭起来，后来就饿死在禁闭室里。此外还有十多个，侥幸逃跑了。
    我现在是虎口余生，又安全地逃到解放区了。希望尚未逃出的同人，赶快设法逃出来，同时希望全国一切民主人士，起来赶快结束蒋介石和阎锡山的黑暗统治，救救这些青年！
