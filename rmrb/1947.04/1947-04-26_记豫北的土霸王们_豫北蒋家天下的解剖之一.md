　　A Record of the Local Tyrants of Northern Henan
    An Anatomy of the Chiang Family's Rule in Northern Henan, Part 1
    Li Pu
    Recently, this reporter accompanied a unit under General Liu Bocheng's command into the Kuomintang-occupied areas of Northern Henan. What I heard and saw astonished me to the extreme. It turns out that this area is like the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods, with large and small local tyrants each occupying a piece of territory, exercising rule in the name of Chiang Kai-shek's orthodoxy in an extremely backward and barbaric manner. Their history and style are roughly the same. Most of them come from bandit backgrounds, and a few are local gentry. In the early days of the War of Resistance Against Japan, everyone received formal appointments from Chiang Kai-shek. Then, under the guidance of Chiang Kai-shek's theory of national salvation through a roundabout route, everyone formally surrendered to the enemy. Chiang Kai-shek and the Japanese gave them numbers at the same time. After the enemy surrendered, Chiang Kai-shek changed their names several times, but no matter what, their basic fiefdoms always remained fixed, and they always held fast to their lairs.
    In early April, a unit under General Liu Bocheng successively eliminated three of them, one named Cheng Daosheng, one named Hu Quanlu, and one named Si Huasheng. Cheng Daosheng is now the团长 of the so-called "Henan Third Special District People's Self-Defense Training Corps First Regiment", and Hu Quanlu is the团长 of the Fourth Regiment, but each of them has an arsenal of not too small a scale. After Hu Quanlu fled with his remnants, the reporter immediately entered his lair and first visited his arsenal. The entire factory had more than fifty technicians, who could produce an average of one light machine gun every three days, or one rifle every day. The factory was located in Pang Village, less than ten li northwest of Junxian Station on the Pinghan Railway, and was established at the end of 1944. At that time, he was the团长 of the 196th Regiment of the Provisional Independent Infantry Brigade of the Sixth Route Army of the puppet regime. Being so close to the enemy's railway line and station, who could do this if they weren't a running dog of the enemy?
    Hu Quanlu, like Cheng Daosheng, came from a bandit background. Since obtaining Chiang Kai-shek's orthodox title, they learned Chiang Kai-shek's method of conscripting soldiers, with the Baojia system supplying the source of troops.
    Originally, every recruit who entered Hu Quanlu's barracks had to find a guarantor. If the recruit himself ran away, the guarantor was responsible for questioning his family, from close relatives to distant relatives and even old relatives. If all these people or the guarantor themselves did not meet the conditions for being soldiers, the Baojia system would have to provide a replacement. Therefore, the local people called Hu Quanlu's soldiers "soldiers for life" or "soldiers for generations."
    The big bandit and big puppet army leader Sun Dianying, who is now based in Tangyin, is Chiang Kai-shek's so-called "Provisional Third Column Commander." It is said that his method of "encouraging" his subordinates to consolidate the troops is as follows: If the number of men in your company, as the company commander, is reduced to the point where it is only enough to form a platoon, you will be demoted to platoon leader; if it is only enough to form a squad, you will be demoted to squad leader. Therefore, you must constantly prevent soldiers from escaping and constantly find ways to replenish troops. Hu Quanlu's method seems to be the same. I found a batch of documents in his office, including many reports from his subordinates to him. One of them read: "This humble team has added × soldiers on × month × day. The names, ages, birthplaces, and guarantor names are listed below for your review and record." (The punctuation is added by the reporter.)
    The reporter interviewed more than a dozen soldiers who were liberated this time, almost all of whom were captured to fill vacancies, rather than being forcibly sent by the original Baojia system. The documents also contained a large number of reports from his subordinates to him, reporting "× soldiers lost on × month × day, and the family members of those captured to fill the vacancies are ×," and specifying the relationship between the two. In most cases, brothers and nephews replaced each other, but there were also cases of nephews running away and uncles being captured, and fathers and sons replacing each other. For example, when Guan Yuliang from Xiaolizhuang ran away, his sixty-year-old father, Guan Qitai, was captured; when Li Zhongde from Jiangzhuang ran away, his fifteen-year-old son, Li Hongchou, was captured. This is just one example. What an unbearable disaster it is that a son is willing to push it onto his own old father, and a father is willing to push it onto his own young son, and is willing to bring the worries of capturing and replacing people to his family. Yet this is Chiang Kai-shek's so-called "People's Self-Defense Training Corps," what a grand name!
    In order to maintain morale and prevent soldiers from joining the People's Liberation Army to seek revenge, Hu Quanlu stipulated that the guarantors and family members of captured soldiers would still be held responsible. In addition to filling vacancies, they also had to compensate for the loss of guns. Yan Yi of Liuzhuang, fifty li west of Junxian City, told me that this was the second time he had been liberated by the Eighth Route Army. When fighting the Eighth Route Army in the winter of 1943, he was captured. Hu Quanlu and his men asked his family for people and guns. Coincidentally, the Eighth Route Army released him, and he was arrested when he returned home, and he paid 350 yuan to compensate for a gun. At that time, the money was worth much more than it is now.
    Those who were killed in battle were generally no longer questioned by their families, but it still depended on whether Hu Quanlu and his men acknowledged that the person had actually been killed. Feng Xiang of Dabajiao Village on the east side of the railway in Junxian County told me that his nephew was killed by the Eighth Route Army near Yigou Station on September 22 last year, and Hu Quanlu arrested him again.
    In addition to capturing an arsenal and a large number of weapons this time in Hu Quanlu's lair, there were also more than 8,000 dan of grain, more than 60 jin of opium, and 6 pairs of shackles, as well as a guillotine specially used for killing people. Over the years, he has massacred about 4,000 people in this area, including ordinary people and his own soldiers. At the beginning of this year, he also buried alive Chen Shaotang, the company commander of the third company of one of his battalions. His battalion commander of the second battalion and the company commander of the engineering company, who were captured this time, both confirmed this incident to me, but said they didn't know why. According to the people, it was because Hu Quanlu had taken a fancy to his wife.
    Hu Quanlu is 37 years old this year, has three wives, has had eight or nine maids, and also has a Henan opera troupe, which he calls a drama troupe, including three actresses. After he had ravaged the maids and actresses, he would reward them to meritorious subordinates. Several people also told me that two years ago he took a fancy to the daughter of the director of the Junxian Education Bureau. The director of the Education Bureau did not dare to say a single word of objection and had to obediently send her to him. I have not yet found specific evidence for this matter, although many people have told me about it.
    His economic exploitation was even more cruel. I plan to talk about it specifically in the next article. In short, "Within the realm, there is no land that is not the king's land; within the realm, there is no subject who is not the king's subject." His sphere of influence is his "fiefdom," and everything belongs to him.
    And Hu Quanlu is just one example. In the entire Northern Henan region, there are more than a dozen such local tyrants enfeoffed by Chiang Kai-shek and the Japanese. Sun Dianying is the biggest. He Guan'san, who was captured alive between Puyang and Hua County last year, and Cheng Daosheng, who was killed in the Anyang area this time, were both larger in scale than Hu Quanlu. In addition to the arsenal, Cheng Daosheng also had four cars and radios to contact Chiang Kai-shek's relevant departments. During this operation, Chiang Kai-shek also sent American-made planes to help him. They are all officials appointed by Chiang Kai-shek's court. In Chiang Kai-shek's view, only they are legitimate and orthodox. During the peace mediation of the Executive Headquarters last year, Chiang Kai-shek protected them in every possible way. It is also because of Chiang Kai-shek's orthodox and legitimate name that they have become increasingly unscrupulous. What exactly is Chiang Kai-shek's orthodoxy?
    When I went from Dabajiao Village, five li east of the Pinghan Railway, to Hu Quanlu's lair, I found an old man to lead the way. At that time, Hu Quanlu was still surrounded and had not run away. Before leaving, he sat on my kang, untied the straps of his leggings, scratched his itch, and muttered, "Can you cure me of this disease?" I asked him what disease it was. I thought it was a sore on his leg, but he pointed to the west. I asked, "Are you talking about Hu Quanlu?" "Yes!" He nodded mysteriously.
    This is Chiang Kai-shek's orthodoxy. Chiang Kai-shek's orthodoxy is the people's disease and the people's scourge. This is the most scientific view. We often say that the people's eyes are sharp because they always proceed from reality. But what is the root of this disease? Isn't it the current feudal emperor Chiang Kai-shek?

### 记豫北的土霸王们  豫北蒋家天下的解剖之一

　　记豫北的土霸王们
    豫北蒋家天下的解剖之一
    李普
    最近记者随刘伯承将军麾下某部进入豫北国民党占领区，耳闻目见，使我惊异到了极点。原来这一带有如春秋战国，大大小小的土霸王各自霸占一块地盘，在蒋介石的正统名义之下，以极端落后和野蛮的方式施行统治。他们的历史和作风大抵相同，大部分出身于土匪，少数是当地的豪绅。抗战初期，大家都得到蒋介石的正式分封，接着，在蒋介石曲线救国论的指导之下，大家正式投降敌人，蒋介石和日本人同时给他们以番号，敌人投降以后，蒋介石几度改变过他们的名称，可是不管怎样，他们的基本采邑总是固定不变的，他们总是固守着他们的巢穴。
    四月上旬，刘伯承将军某部先后解决了其中的三个，一个叫程道生，一个叫扈全禄，一个叫司华生。程道生现在是所谓“河南第三专区民众自卫集训总队第一团”团长，扈全禄是第四团团长，但是他们各人都有一所规模不算太小的兵工厂。扈全禄率残部逃跑之后，记者随即进入他的巢穴，首先参观他的兵工厂，全厂有五十多个技术工人，平均每三天可以出轻机枪一挺，或每天出步枪一枝。厂址在平汉路浚县车站西北不足十华里的庞村，成立于民国三十三年底。那时候，他是伪第六方面军暂编陆军独立步兵第十六旅一九六团团长，离敌人的铁路线和车站这样近，要不是敌人的死走狗，谁能够这样做？
    扈全禄和程道生一样，都是土匪出身，自从取得蒋介石的正统名义，他们就学会了蒋介石征抽壮丁的办法，由保甲供应兵源。
    原来每一个壮丁进入扈全禄的兵营，都要找一个保人，如果本人逃跑了，由保人负责追问他的家属，从近亲远亲以至于老亲戚，如果所有这些人或保人自己都不够当兵的条件，再由保甲重新补交一个。因此这一带的老百姓把扈全禄的兵叫做“辈子兵”或“辈辈兵”。
    大土匪大伪军头子孙殿英，现据汤阴，是蒋介石的所谓“暂编第三纵队司令”。据说他“鼓励”部下巩固部队的办法是这样，假定你这个连长的一连人减少到只够编一个排，就降你为排长，只够编一个班，就降你为班长。因此你非得随时防止士兵逃跑，随时设法补充兵员不可。扈全禄的办法仿佛也是这样，我在他的办公室中发现一批文件，其中有许多他部下给他的报告单。其中之一这样写道：“窃职队于×月×日增补列兵×名，兹将姓名年龄籍贯及保人姓名开列如下，呈请鉴核备查。”（标点是记者加的）
    记者访问了十几个这次解放的士兵，几乎全部是抓来顶补，而不是原来保甲强派的。文件中又有一大批他部下向他报告“某月某日失纵列兵×名，抓来顶补之家属×名”的报告单，并注明着两者的关系。以兄弟叔侄互相顶补的为最多，也有外甥跑了把舅舅抓来的，也有父子相顶的。比如小李庄的关玉良跑了，把他六十岁的老父亲关启泰抓了来，姜庄的李仲德跑了，抓来了他的十五岁的小儿子李红丑。这不过是略举一例而已。这是一种多么难于忍受的灾难，以致使一个做儿子的不惜把它推给自己的老父亲，做父亲的不惜把它推给自己的小儿子，并且不惜把追捕顶补人的苛忧带给自己的家庭。然而这是蒋介石的所谓“民众自卫集训总队”哩，多么堂皇的名义啊！
    为了维持斗志和防止士兵们参加解放军来报仇雪恨，扈全禄规定凡被俘的士兵保人和家属仍旧要负责任。顶补缺额之外，还要赔偿枪支的损失。浚县城西五十里刘庄的颜益告诉我，这是他第二次被八路军解放。三十二年冬天打八路军时，他被俘虏了，扈全禄们向他家里要人要枪，恰巧八路军释放了他，他回到家里就给捉了来，并且赔了三百五十元抵一枝枪，那时候的钱比现在值钱得多了。
    作战中被打死的，一般的不再追问家属，但是还要看扈全禄们是否承认这个人真的已经打死。浚县境内铁路东侧大八角村的冯香对我说，去年九月二十二日他的侄子在宜沟车站附近被八路军打死了，扈全禄又把他抓了来。
    这次在扈全禄的巢穴中除缴获兵工厂一座和大批武器外，还有八千多担粮食，六十多斤鸦片，又搜出镣铐六副，专门用以杀人的铡刀一把。几年来他屠杀了这一带的老百姓和他自己的士兵约在四千人以上。今年年初他又活埋了他部下一营三连的连长陈少棠。这次被俘的他的二营营长和工兵连长，都为我证实了这件事，只是说不知道为了什么。据老百姓说：是因为扈全禄看中了他的女人。
    扈全禄今年三十七岁，有三个老婆，先后有过八、九个丫头，还有一个美其名曰话剧团的河南高腔班子，其中有三个女伶，丫头们和女伶们在他自己蹂躏过之后，便赏赐给有功的部属。好几个老百姓又告诉我一件事，前年他看中了浚县教育局长的女儿，区区教育局长，那里敢说半个不字，只得乖乖的送给他，这件事我还没有找到具体的证据，虽然和我说起这件事的老百姓非常多。
    他在经济上的压榨，更是残酷到了极点，我准备在下一篇文章里专门谈一谈。总之，“率土之滨，莫非王土，率士之民，莫非王臣。”他的势力范围就是他的“采邑”，一切都是他的。
    而扈全禄只不过是一个例子而已。整个豫北地区，蒋介石和日本人加封的这种土霸王，一共还有十多个。孙殿英是最大的，去年在濮县、滑县之间活捉的何冠三和这次在安阳境内打死的程道生，规模都比扈全禄大。程道生在兵工厂之外，还有四部汽车，还有无线电和蒋介石的有关部门联络，这次作战，蒋介石还派了美国造的飞机来帮助他。他们都是蒋介石朝廷的钦命官员，在蒋介石看来，唯有他们是合法的，正统的，去年执行部的和平调处，蒋介石多方庇护他们。也是因为有蒋介石的正统的合法的名义，他们才这样越来越肆无忌惮，然则蒋介石的正统究竟是什么东西呢？
    当我从平汉路东侧五华里的大八角村到扈全禄的巢穴去的时候，找了一个老百姓带路，那时扈全禄正在包围之中，还没有跑掉。出发之前，他坐在我的炕上解开扎裤脚的带子抓痒，一面喃喃地说：“能给咱治治咱这个病吗？”我问他什么病，我以为是腿上长了疮，但是他向西边指一指。我追问道：“你是说扈全禄吗？”“是啊！”他神秘地点一点头。
    这就是蒋介石的正统，蒋介石的正统是人民的病，是人民的祸害。这是最科学的看法。我们常常说老百姓的眼睛是雪亮的，因为他们总是从实际出发。然则这个病根子是什么？不就是当今的封建天子蒋介石吗？
