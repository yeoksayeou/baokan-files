　　Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 21st: A summary by reporters in Central Jiangsu of the people's six-month anti-"suppression" self-defense movement in Rugao, Taixing, Taizhou, and Jingjiang counties states: Whenever Chiang's troops move out, sentry posts in each township spread the word from village to village. In an instant, the sound of gongs echoes for dozens of miles, and the people rise up to "evacuate." What can be carried is taken away, and what cannot be carried is hidden, so that Chiang's troops cannot obtain a single grain of rice or a twig of firewood. When the People's Liberation Army launches an attack, millions of people surge forward like a tide to assist in the battle. In the battle of Sidunzi in Jingjiang, 5,000 people rushed to the battlefield within an hour to help search for the enemy. In the battles of Kou'an and Dingjiazhuang in Taixing, the masses from more than twenty villages near the front line assisted in the battle. In the campaign to recover Zhoujiazhuang in Rugao, more than 10,000 people demolished bunkers. When Chiang's troops fled in defeat, the people launched a campaign to seize weapons and capture prisoners. The reporters continued: In places where Chiang's troops might build strongholds, such as Shenglutang in Jingjiang and Laoyezhuang in Taixing, the people have razed them to the ground. In topographically advantageous locations, they have been rebuilt in a scattered pattern. Chiang's troops cannot find a place to stay in these houses, which are all sentry posts for the people to monitor Chiang's troops. The movement to destroy transportation lines is flourishing. The Xi (Lai Town) Xie (Bridge) Highway in Jingjiang, which is only twelve li long, cost Chiang's troops dozens of dan of lead wire, more than a thousand pieces of wood, tens of thousands of bamboo poles, and more than three months of work, but the power lines could not be erected and vehicles could not pass. All major roads have also been destroyed. This mass movement is constantly creating and improving. Taking "evacuation" as an example, it started as a chaotic scramble, but now each village has an evacuation team, with sensitive intelligence and convenient action. Each township and village also has reception centers so that those who evacuate do not go hungry. After the rural areas are militarized, the masses sleep collectively in a more organized manner, and when there is intelligence, they can flexibly disperse and transfer. Chiang's troops use methods such as "triangular encirclement" and "four-sided encirclement" to round up the people, but often fail. Once, Chiang's troops concentrated 2,000 soldiers to encircle six townships in a certain district of Taixing, but the people in the area planned their advance and retreat and maneuvered with the enemy, so that the enemy searched for four days without gaining anything. The masses have also created methods such as "earth telephones," "listening to telegrams," "mud bodhisattvas on sentry duty," and "scarecrows on guard duty," making the enemy feel as if they were in a maze. In this cruel struggle, unity between the army and the people, and between the people themselves, has been strengthened. More than a thousand cadres have been selflessly protected by the people. People in disaster areas help and support each other. Taixing launched a "handful of rice" movement to resettle more than a thousand disaster victims. No one starved to death, and there was not a single beggar. The people firmly believe that victory is their own.

　　反“清剿”中人人坚强
    苏中农村兵营化
    【新华社华中二十一日电】苏中记者综述如皋、泰兴、泰州、靖江四县人民六个月来的反“清剿”自卫运动称：每当蒋军出动，各乡哨位，村村相传，顷刻数十里一片锣声，人民群起“跑反”。可带的带走，不能带的藏起，不给蒋军粒米根柴。当人民解放军出击时，千万人民又潮水般的涌来助战。靖江四墩子之战，一小时内五千人涌上战场，帮助搜索敌人。泰兴口岸、丁家庄之战，火线附近二十余庄群众助战。如皋收复周家庄之役，万余群众破拆碉堡。蒋军溃逃时，人民即展开缴枪捉俘虏运动。记者继称：在蒋军可能筑据点的地方，如靖江之生禄堂、泰兴之老业庄等地，均被人民拆为平地。在地形有利的地方，则又星罗棋布的重建起来。这些房子，蒋军无法驻足。俱是人民监视蒋军的哨位。各交通线上破拆运动蓬勃开展。靖江西（来镇）斜（桥）公路，仅长十二里，蒋军花费数十担铅丝，千余根木头，上万根竹子，三个多月，电线未架起，车子无法通行，各条大路亦均被破坏。这一群众运动，日有创造与提高，以“跑反”为例，开始是乱跑，现在各村都有跑反小组，情报灵敏，行动方便，各乡、村又设有招待所，使跑反的人不致饿肚。农村兵营化后，群众更有组织的集体睡觉，有情报时即机动分散转移。蒋军用“三角合击”、“四面包围”等方法兜捕人民，往往落空。一次，蒋军集中二千兵力层层包围泰兴某区六个乡，该地人民有计划的进退与敌周旋，使敌搜索四天毫无所获，群众更创造了“土电话”、“听电报”、“泥菩萨站岗”、“谷草人放哨”等办法，使敌如入迷魂阵。在此残酷斗争中，军民之间，民与民之间倍加团结。人民舍已掩护的干部已有一千余人。受灾区人民互助互济，泰兴开展一把米运动，安置了千余灾民，没有一个人饿死，没有一个乞丐，人民坚信胜利是自己的。
