　　Developing Sidelines to Buy Livestock
　　Office of the Border Government, Zhao Xiushan

　　In order to promptly solve the shortage of livestock for this year's spring plowing and help liberated peasants establish their households, in addition to government loans, organizing the masses to purchase, and various localities using the fruits of struggle in filling gaps and making up deficiencies to purchase, various localities have achieved great results in buying livestock with money earned from sideline production this spring and last winter. The methods of various localities are introduced below for reference: (1) Developing transportation to increase wealth and acquire livestock. For example, in Dongbei Village, Licheng, Taihang, ten large carts traveling back and forth on the Handan-Changzhi highway once can earn one head of livestock and one large cart, creating a village-wide upsurge in buying livestock. In Muzhuang Village, Huguan, last winter thirteen livestock transported to Henan Store five times, earning 400,000 yuan. This spring, eight livestock transported three times, earning 130,000 yuan. The masses saw that transportation with livestock was very profitable and rushed to buy them. Now they have bought two mules, two donkeys, and nineteen head of cattle. In Dan Yin Village, Shexian County, only two livestock were used for transportation last spring, but by the end of the year, twenty large mules had been added. In Dananzhuang, Zuoquan, sixty-six donkeys earned one donkey and two cattle in one month of transportation. Under the leadership of Zheng Yinshuo, a labor hero from Nuanyao, Heshun, 65 mules and donkeys and 20 porters in the village were organized, and 30 transportations were made in half a month, earning 342,500 yuan. It is planned to buy fifteen donkeys before spring plowing. Under the leadership of Labor Hero Zhao Gang in Tuling Village, all 33 donkeys in the village transported to Xingtai four times, earning 720,000 yuan and buying five head of livestock. (2) Organizing spinning and weaving to earn money to buy livestock. For example, in Tantou Village, Jincheng, Taiyue, the cooperative organized the masses to spin and weave and, together with the oil mill, earned 700,000 yuan last year. After the cooperative retained some capital for re-production, it purchased 135 kilograms of cotton. More than 70 women started spinning and weaving in the first half of the first month, weaving 55 bolts of cloth, selling them for 210,000 yuan, and buying four livestock, which were distributed to four mutual aid groups. In Nanzhuang, the third district of Pingshun, Taihang, women started spinning and weaving on the fifth day of the first month. In ten days, they spun 56 kilograms of cotton and wove 34 zhang of cloth, earning 90,000 yuan. The men earned 190,000 yuan from transportation and bought a mule. Therefore, everyone has a greater enthusiasm for spinning and weaving, and they plan to intensify spinning and weaving before spring plowing to buy two more donkeys. Zhang Laicheng, a labor hero from Songyan Base Point in Heshun, used 1,000 yuan of capital to spin, weave, and raise pigs, turning it into 115,000 yuan, which can buy the best donkey. (3) Raising pigs to earn money to exchange for livestock, and exchanging large livestock for small livestock. For example, in Pang Village, Gaoping, Taiyue, one family borrowed 3,000 yuan last year to buy three piglets. The piglets grew up and were exchanged for a cow, and the big cow gave birth to a calf. Five families in Zhao Village also adopted this method and bought five cows. One family in Mitian Village sold a mule and exchanged it for four cows. (4) Buying livestock through the production of salt leaching, cotton ginning, cotton rolling, and fishing. For example, the mutual aid joint brigade of Wang Chaozhu in Jiudian, Guangzong, Jinnan, plans to seize the time before spring plowing to step up salt leaching and cotton rolling to buy fifteen cows. Nanliu Village in the first district of Qiuxian is surrounded by trees on one side and sandy land on three sides. Last year's floods reduced the autumn harvest, and the masses were panicked. Yuan Zhaolin, a labor hero of the village, immediately led everyone to organize salt leaching and cotton ginning, earning more than 349,000 yuan, and overcame the disaster, and bought ten cows. More than 60 people in Qiyangxing Village, Zaoqiang, organized fishing five times, earning more than 100,000 yuan and buying two cows. The above methods have solved some of the livestock difficulties. Of course, there are many specific methods in various places, and livestock can be purchased according to the production conditions in each place.

　　发展副业购买牲口
    边府办公室  赵秀山
    为及时解决今年春耕牲畜困难，帮助翻身农民建立家务，除政府发放贷款，组织群众购买及各地在填平补齐中用斗争果实购买外，各地在今春与去冬以副业生产赚钱购买牲口，获得很大成绩，兹将各地办法介绍以供参考：（一）发展运输，增加财富，添置牲口。如太行黎城董北村十辆大车往返邯长公路一次，即可赚牲口一头大车一辆，造成全村买牲口热潮。壶关睦庄村，去年冬季十三个牲口往河南店运输五次，赚洋四十万。今春八个牲口运输三次，赚洋十三万，群众见有了牲口运输获利很大，纷纷购买，现已买骡子二头，毛驴二头，牛十九头。涉县弹音村去年春天仅二头牲口运输，至年底已增加大骡子廿个。左权大南庄六十六头毛驴运输一月即赚了一头驴二头牛。和顺暖窑劳动英雄郑银锁领导下，将全村骡驴六十五头扳扛队廿名组织起来，半月运输三十次，赚洋三十四万二千五百元。计划在春耕之前，买驴十五头。土岭村在劳英赵刚领导下，全村三十三头毛驴往邢台运输四次，即赚洋七十二万，买牲口五头。（二）组织纺织赚钱买牲口。如太岳晋城坛头村，合作社去年组织群众纺织与油坊共赚洋七十万，除合作社留一部再生产资本外，购买棉花一百三十五斤，妇女七十余人在正月上半月即开始纺织，织布五十五匹，卖了二十一万元，买了四个牲口，分给四个互助组。太行平顺三区南庄，正月初五妇女开始纺织，十天纺织五十六斤，织布三十四丈，赚九万元，男人运输赚洋十九万，买了一头骡子，因此大家纺织劲头更大，计划在春耕前加紧纺织，再买二头毛驴。和顺松烟基点劳动英雄张来成用一千元资本纺织、喂猪，变成十一万五千元，可以买一头最好的毛驴。（三）喂猪赚钱换牲口，及以大牲口换成小牲口。如太岳高平庞村一家去年贷款三千元，买了三个猪娃，猪娃长大换了一头牛，大牛又生一头小牛。赵庄村也有五家采用了这种办法，买了五头牛。米田村一家骡子卖掉换了四头牛。（四）淋盐、弹花、轧花、捕鱼等生产买牲口。如冀南广宗旧店王朝柱互助联合大队计划在春耕前抓紧时间淋盐轧花买牛十五头。邱县一区南刘村一面靠树行三面靠沙地，去年水灾秋收减成，群众慌慌不安，该村劳动英雄袁兆林即领导大家组织淋盐，弹花，赚了三十四万九千余元，渡过了灾荒，还买了十头牛。枣强齐杨兴村六十余人组织起来捕鱼五次，获利十余万，买牛二头。以上各种办法，都解决了一部分牲口困难，各地具体办法当然很多，可以根据各地生产条件购买牲口。
