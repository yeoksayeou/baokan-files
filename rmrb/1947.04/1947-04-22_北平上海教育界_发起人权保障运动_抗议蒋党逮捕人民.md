Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th: Shanghai Wenhui Bao reports: Educational circles in the Chiang-controlled areas are protesting Chiang Kai-shek's fascist arrests in various places and have launched a human rights protection movement. Following the declaration by three professors in Beiping and sixty-six professors in Shanghai, the Shanghai educational community, in order to broadly protect human rights, organized the Shanghai Education Circle Human Rights Protection Association, initiated by professors such as Ma Yinchu, Shen Tilan, and Sun Qimeng. The association was established on March 12th, issuing a declaration protesting the arbitrary arrests by Chiang's police, demanding the immediate release of arrested people, and calling on people from all walks of life to unite and fight to the end for the protection of human rights.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 19th: According to the Dagong Bao report of March 23rd: Zhang Naiqi and Liu Wang Liming, directors of the Shanghai China International Human Rights Protection Association, represented the association in hosting various sectors on the 22nd of last month, calling for a stop to fascist arrests. Zhang Naiqi believes that if this situation continues, China's politics will be worse than Spain's; Liu Wang Liming said in a speech: The mayor of Shanghai should release the missing persons. Finally, it was decided to negotiate with the municipal government's garrison headquarters, register the families of missing persons, and extensively raise donations to help the families of missing persons.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 17th: Shanghai Wenhui Bao reported on March 19th: The Kuomintang controlled areas' secret agent rule is increasing day by day. The Chengdu Police Bureau has drafted a plan to organize and train "volunteer police" and "militia police." Rickshaw pullers, carriage drivers, tea house, bathhouse and hotel staff, waiters, factory workers, monks, Taoists, masters, and other entertainment venue workers will all be conscripted as "volunteer police" and conduct secret activities after training. "Militia police" will openly assist the police in carrying out their tasks, and those conscripted will be from hotels, theaters, banks, and businesses, with each establishment sending one person. The North District police in Nanjing are busy organizing "people's patrol teams," led by the Jia chief to patrol house by house. Jiangdu held a so-called "surprise inspection," arresting 49 men and women in the first two hours.

Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 20th: Following the large-scale inspection in early March in Qingdao, which resulted in the arrest of more than 5,000 innocent citizens, in mid-March, Chiang's plainclothes agents broke into shops for inspection. Even drafts and receipts could become "evidence of collusion with the Eighth Route Army," resulting in the closure of more than a hundred businesses. The illegally arrested merchants were all blindfolded and taken away by car. Those released after paying a fine were also blindfolded with black cloth and taken to the streets before being released, just like paying a ransom. The more than 5,000 arrested citizens were also taken away by truck.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 19th: Shanghai News: In Hushu Pass Town, near Suzhou, known as "Paradise," a dozen Kuomintang officers gang-raped obstetrician Li Yuying. The female doctor usually lived a very serious life and her business was quite developed. Because of her beauty, she aroused the covetousness of many Chiang officers. On the fourth night, under the pretext of asking her to deliver a baby, they lured the female doctor and her maid into the officers' dormitory and forcibly gang-raped them both. The female doctor, after suffering this humiliation, wanted to commit suicide several times. This incident has aroused the anger of the general public.

    抗议蒋党逮捕人民
    【新华社陕北十六日电】沪文汇报讯：蒋管区教育界抗议蒋介石在各地进行法西斯逮捕，发起人权保障运动。从北平的三教授、上海六十六教授发表宣言后，上海教育界为广大保障人权运动，由马寅初、沈体兰、孙起孟等教授发起组织上海教育界人权保障会。该会已于三月十二日成立，发表宣言、抗议蒋宪警之任意拘捕，要求立即放逮捕人民，并呼吁各界人民团结一致为人权保障奋斗到底。
    【新华社陕北十九日电】据大公报三月二十三日讯：上海中华国际人权保障会理事章乃器、刘王立明等，于上月二十二日代表该会招待各界，呼吁制止法西斯逮捕。章乃器认为这种情形如任其延续下去，则中国之政治将不如西班牙；刘王立明发言：要上海市长把失踪的人放出来。最后决议向市府警备部交涉，进行失踪人员家属登记，广泛发动募捐，援助失踪人家属。
    【新华社陕北十七日电】三月十九日沪文汇报讯：蒋管区特务统治花样日益增多。成都警察局已拟定计划，将组训“义务警察”及“义勇警察”，凡人力车夫、马车夫、茶馆浴室旅馆等茶房、酒店小二、工厂工人、和尚、道士、法师及其他娱乐场所工作人员等，均将被征为“义务警察”，训练后进行秘密活动。“义勇警察”则为公开协助警察执行任务，被征者为旅馆、剧院、银行及商号，每店出一人。南京北区吃警所饭者忙于组织“人民巡查班”，由甲长带头按户巡查。江都举行所谓“突击检查”，第一次检查两小时即捕去男女四十九名。
    【新华社山东二十日电】青岛市继三月初大检查逮捕无辜市民五千余后，三月中旬蒋党便衣特务又闯入商店检查，甚至汇票、单据亦可成为“勾结八路”之“罪证”，因而横遭查封之商号达百余家。非法捕去之商人均将眼＠闭用汽车载走，事后罚款获释者亦用黑布＠眼载至市街始放，俨如赎票。被逮捕之市民五千余亦悉用卡车载走。
    【新华社陕北十九日电】沪讯：号称“天堂”的苏州附近浒墅关镇，发生十数蒋军官轮奸产科医师李玉英暴行。该女医平时生活极严肃，业务相当发达。因其美貌，引起当地许多蒋军官之垂涎。四日夜，竟以请接生为名，将该女医及其婢女诱入军官宿舍，用暴力将二人加以轮奸。该女医遭此蹂躏，曾几度要想自杀。此事已引起一般社会人士之愤怒。
