Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 13th: Under the guideline of "Eliminating 'Half-Cooked Rice' and Combining with Spring Planting Production," Hejiang has achieved further results in land reform. Xingping Town in Yilan first enlightened the masses to discuss and solve difficulties in production, linking the shortage of land and livestock power to the need to overturn black land and investigate hidden property of landlords. Then, they mobilized the masses to dig out bad roots, overturn black land, and investigate hidden things and horses of landlords. After that, land certificates were immediately issued to the peasants to organize them for spring planting. Now, peasants in each village are automatically rising up to repeatedly struggle against landlords who were not thoroughly struggled against, truly achieving "cooking the half-cooked rice to a done state." In the Xiaowuzhan Tun area of Boli County, with the help of the work team, a re-distribution of land and struggle was carried out. In half a month, 21 local tyrants were overthrown. The plan is to re-examine the cleared land once again in future production and issue all the land certificates. In the Jin-Fu areas, the method of combining points and areas was adopted. First, efforts were concentrated on mobilizing the masses in a base-point village to speak out about their suffering, find the root of poverty, and dig out the bad roots. Then, land was investigated and certificates were exchanged to organize the masses for spring planting. This experience was then extended to other villages. As a result, six hidden landlords and five secret agent ringleaders were dug out in the fifth district in half a month. Hengshan Tun dug out 300 *qing* of black land and 30 to 40 black horses, and is now entering spring planting. In the second district of Huachuan County, in six days, 14 landlords and local tyrants were overthrown in eight villages, obtaining 764 *qing* of land, 88 *shi* of grain, and other livestock and houses.

　　合江解决春耕困难
    结合开展土地复查
    【新华社东北十三日电】合江各地在“消灭‘夹生’，结合春耕生产”的方针下，土地改革续获成果。依兰惺平镇首先启发群众讨论，解决生产中的困难，联系到地少畜力缺，应向地主翻黑地、查隐物等问题，接着便发动群众挖坏根、翻黑地，查出地主隐瞒的东西和马匹后，马上发给农民地照，来组织群众春耕。现各屯农民都自动起来，反复斗争未斗透的地主，真正做到“把夹生饭煮熟”。勃利县小五站屯区，在工作队帮助下，重新进行分地斗争，半月来斗倒廿一个恶霸，计划在今后生产中，再将清查过的土地重查一遍，发完地照。锦富各区则采用点面结合的方法，首先集中力量在一基点村发动群众诉苦、找穷根、挖坏根，接着查地换照，以组织群众春耕。然后将此经验推及其他村，结果五区在半月中挖掉隐蔽地主六个，特务头子五个。恒山屯挖出黑地三百垧，黑马三、四十匹，现正进入春耕。桦川县二区更于六天中在八个屯中，斗倒了十四个地主、恶霸，获得土地七百六十四垧，粮食八十八石及其他牲口房子等。
