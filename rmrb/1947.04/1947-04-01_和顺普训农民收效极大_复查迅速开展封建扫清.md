　　[Heshun News from our Newspaper] Beginning in February, Heshun conducted large-scale general training for over 40,000 peasants. Because the trained peasants eliminated concerns about "losing conscience," "the heavens changing," "making mistakes," and "struggle" in their thinking, after returning to their villages, they automatically launched a fiery review, greatly accelerating the process of land reform. It is estimated that the entire county has additionally identified more than 11,600 mu of land, more than 7,000 rooms, 900 head of cattle and donkeys, as well as goods and grain. Various organizations have also been reorganized: the Peasants' Association purged more than 1,000 people and recruited another 2,000, now totaling more than 15,000 members. The militia purged 400 hidden landlord children and developed 500 new members, now with 5,500 militia members.
　　The sixty-seven villages that were previously backward have also all been successfully opened up. Experience proves that: (1) The unconsciousness of the broad masses of peasants is a good cover for the concealment of feudal remnants. If the peasants' thinking is not conscious for even one day, feudal remnants can survive for one day. Abandoning the conscious awakening of the peasants' thinking, and only pursuing anti-feudalism will be in vain. General training of peasants is precisely an effective means to awaken the peasants' consciousness and achieve thorough anti-feudalism. (2) There is a large unawakened stratum among the peasants. The handicraft-style method of mobilizing village by village and household by household is extremely slow. Adopting the method of large-scale general training where leaders directly meet with the broad masses of peasants, and targeting the peasants' concerns about "losing conscience," "the heavens changing," "making mistakes," and "getting rich," using the leadership's enlightenment and the peasants' own discussions, through their own experiences, to achieve the purpose of self-education, is extremely effective. (3) After the peasants are awakened during the general training, they will expose the facts of feudal concealment in their villages. Authorizing the peasants who return to review feudalism, the movement will quickly unfold piece by piece, overcoming the contradiction of having few district and county cadres and a large area to cover. (4) More activists will emerge during the general training, so that the leadership group always maintains a posture of leading the masses forward.
　　Because Heshun adopted the above experience, the movement developed extremely rapidly, and the land redistribution movement has now come to an end. (Heshun Political Office Communications Group)

　　和顺普训农民收效极大
    复查迅速开展封建扫清
    【本报和顺讯】从二月开始和顺大规模普训农民达四万余人，由于受训农民在思想上扫除了怕亏心、怕变天、怕犯错、怕斗争的顾虑，回去后各村自动的展开了复查的烈火，大大加速了土地改革的进程。计全县又斗出土地一万一千六百余亩，房七千余间，牛驴九百头及物品粮食等。各种组织也得到了整理：农会清洗了一千余人，又吸收了二千人，现有一万五千余人，民兵中清洗了隐藏的地主子弟四百人，又发展五百人，现有民兵五千五百人。
    一向落后的六十七个村也全数突开。经验证明：（一）广大农民不自觉，是封建残余藏身匿迹的好掩体，农民思想一日不自觉，封建残余得以一日苟藏。抛开农民思想自觉，而单追反封建将是徒劳无功的，集训农民正是为了唤醒农民自觉，达到彻底反封建的有效手段。（二）农民中不觉悟层是很大的，手工业式的逐村逐户发动方式是效用极慢的，采用领导与广大农民直接相见面的大规模集训方式，针对农民思想上存在的怕亏心、怕变天、怕犯错、怕发财的顾虑，运用领导上启发与农民自己讨论，透过其切身经验，达到自己教育自己的目的，效用极大。（三）集训中农民觉悟后，便会揭露本村封建隐藏的事实，领导上授权回去的农民复查封建，运动便很快的一片一片的展开，克服了区县干部少、地区广的矛盾。（四）集训中会涌出更多的积极分子，使领导集团永远保持着带领群众前进的姿态。
    和顺由于采用了上述经验，故运动开展极为迅速，填补运动现已告一段落。（和顺政治处通讯小组）
