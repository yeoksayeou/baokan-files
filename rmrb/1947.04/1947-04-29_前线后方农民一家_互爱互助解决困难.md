　　Frontline and Rear Area Peasants are One Family
　　Mutual Love and Assistance to Solve Difficulties
　　　　　　Wu'an Militia Carrying Stretchers to the Front Lines, Saving Grain to Relieve Refugees in the New District
　　After the militia from the Fifth District of Wu'an arrived in Houying Village in Tangyin, they visited the masses to understand their suffering. They learned that the people in the village were heavily exploited by the local bandit leader Hu Quanlu, leaving them destitute and unable to make ends meet. The militia immediately launched a "love the people" campaign, with each person saving two liang of rice (approximately 100 grams) per day. In total, they saved over 200 jin (approximately 100 kilograms) of grain in five days, which deeply moved the masses. The county headquarters immediately commended their actions. County Chief Cheng told all the militia members, "The suffering of the people in Tangyin is our suffering. We should learn from the Fifth District Militia." His call was answered by all the participating militia. On April 16th, each person saved one liang of rice in a single day, with some saving half a jin to ten liang. Over 4,000 participants saved a total of over 2,260 jin of millet. In addition, they actively helped the local masses by carrying water and manure, earning the praise of the local people.

　　　　Loving the People, Strictly Abiding by Discipline, Transport Teams Help the Masses Repair Pots
　　The Wu'an militia stretcher team formulated six rules of discipline for the masses during the march: First, do not take a single needle or thread from the masses. Second, do not beat or scold the masses and do not label village cadres and masses as "backward and stubborn." Third, do not walk on wheat fields. Fourth, do not urinate or defecate indiscriminately. Fifth, borrowed items must be returned, and damage must be compensated. Sixth, when leaving, bundle the straw bedding on the door panels and clean the houses. Each team aimed to become a model of compliance with the rules of discipline for the masses and challenged each other to compete. When the transport team arrived at Xiaohangling, they helped the masses repair 50 iron pots. The masses were very grateful and voluntarily offered them radish strips to eat. The Wu'an participating militia stretcher team left a very good impression on the people of Tangyin and were able to receive help everywhere. (Boying)
　　　　　Stretcher Team Combines with Production, No Difficulty in Eating Vegetables or Lighting Lamps
　　The Wu'an Fifth District participating team created a method of making "preserved fat" to save lamp oil during the march. They picked up hemp seeds and cotton from cut firewood, mashed them together, and wrapped them around thin firewood, which could be used as candles. The Third District organized back-weaving basket teams, haircutting teams, carrying teams, etc. in each company, taking time to engage in production and solve the difficulty of insufficient vegetable money. (Youying)
　　　　　Lin County Linqi Women Help the Laborers Take Apart and Change Cotton Clothes
　　After the Changzhi laborers arrived in Linqi, with the help of Cui Kexue from Lin County, they mobilized the local women to help them disassemble and exchange cotton clothes. The local women all understood that "peasants are one family under heaven" and that fighting was for the benefit of all. They actively sewed and mended clothes, with some saying, "Even if I tear my own cloth shirt, I will still mend it well." Soon, they sewed and patched 187 pieces of clothing. Many women gave their own cloth. Li Hong's mother saw that the laborer's pants were so badly torn that they were beyond recognition, so she gave her son's single pants to the laborer to wear. The clothes for over 400 people were quickly changed. Greatly moved by this sewing and mending of clothes, the Changzhi laborers were deeply touched. Everyone unanimously helped the common people with production. The next day, 277 people participated, cultivating over 100 mu of wheat fields, digging 13 mu of land, carrying 250 loads of manure, and planting flowers on 6 mu of land in half a day. (Shengxiang, Du Bin, Baoshan, Juntu)
　　　　　Li Guicheng and Others Care for the Wounded Soldiers, Working Tirelessly Day and Night to Transport Them
　　Li Guicheng and five others from Lijia Chang Village in Lin County received a wounded soldier and rushed to transport him for two days and three nights without rest. The wounded soldier was bleeding non-stop, so he put his new quilt underneath the soldier. When they passed the Eighteen Bends Mountain Road, the wounded soldier was uncomfortable being carried, so he quickly stepped forward to carry the wounded soldier on his back. Every time they passed a village, he would ask the wounded soldier to rest and drink some soup. He treated the wounded soldier as if he were his own family, saying, "Without the Eighth Route Army, there would be nothing for us. They shed blood and sweat, what does it matter if we put in a little effort?" (Zhixuan, Yintian, Beishun)
　　Li Yingcheng from Shangjiao Village in Lingchuan County is a deputy leader of the stretcher squad. In battle, he once pulled back four wounded soldiers, two seriously wounded and two lightly wounded. As the troops charged forward in front, he pulled the wounded soldiers behind. The second time, he pulled back another wounded soldier and a livestock animal. When Platoon Leader × was injured, he risked artillery fire and traveled three or four li to rescue him. He also personally carried stretchers and sent them to the first station.
