　　Kunwu Postal Workers Go Deep into Rural Areas
    Carrying Out Newspaper Distribution Work
    [This newspaper's Ji-Lu-Yu dispatch on the 9th] Kunwu postal workers are going deep into rural areas to carry out newspaper distribution work. In the seventh district, 200 new subscribers were developed in 20 days, of which rural subscribers accounted for 60 percent. Postal workers Xu Fuqi, Li Fulan, and others, in order to raise the political and cultural level of emancipated peasants, actively distributed newspapers, setting out every day after breakfast and returning only at the third watch of the night. Every time they arrived in a village, they introduced news about the emancipation of the masses and the victory of the war from the newspapers to the village cadres and the masses. Therefore, wherever they went, the newspapers were welcomed by the village cadres and the masses. For this reason, the district post office issued a commendation order and awarded them a bonus of 4,000 yuan.

　　昆吾邮工深入农村
    开展报纸发行工作
    【本报冀鲁豫九日电】昆吾邮工深入农村开展报纸发行工作。七区二十天中即发展新订户二百，其中农村订户占百分之六十。该区邮工徐福起、李福兰等为提高翻身农民政治文化水平，积极发行报纸，每天早饭后出发，黑夜三更才回来。他们每到一村，即向村干和群众介绍报纸上群众翻身和战争胜利的消息，故他们走到那里，报纸就在那里受到村干和群众的欢迎。为此，区邮局特通令表扬，并予以四千元奖金。
