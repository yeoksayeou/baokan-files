　　How to Combine Participation in War, Production, and Land Distribution?
　　Chongyi Men and Women All Offer Ideas
　　Assign Plans and Collectively Achieve Meritorious Service

　　[Special Dispatch] In February, Chongyi Village, Eighth District of Wu'an, completed land redistribution, and the peasants have all obtained land (detailed account was introduced in this newspaper on February 26th). In order to thoroughly eliminate feudalism, transform the work style of cadres, fully mobilize the "backward" masses, and further strengthen the relationship between cadres and the masses, at the end of March, the village carried out a "face-washing and black-removing" campaign, resolving grievances, digging air-raid shelters, filling loopholes, and evaluating merits, which was an "support the cadres and cherish the people" movement. Just as this movement reached its climax, at the beginning of this month, the urgent task of preparing for war arrived. Militia, stretcher teams, transportation teams, and livestock needed to be ready to mobilize at any time. At the same time, the major production task of spring plowing and sowing was also imminent. These three major events were crammed together. Which was more important? Which should be done first and which later? How to combine them? This stirred up all the men, women, old, and young in the village. In families, in alleyway meals, in textile groups, in big schools and small study rooms, in cooperatives, in women's associations, in children's corps, in elderly teams, in farmers' associations, in militia, in self-defense forces, and in production mutual aid groups, people were deliberating and arguing. Some said: "Protecting Chairman Mao and driving away Old Chiang is the most important thing. Even if the land is deserted, we must participate in the war and support the front lines." Some said: "Going to the front line to fight Old Chiang is important, but production is also important. Not even one mu of land can be left uncultivated." Some said: "Washing faces and resolving grievances, so everyone is of one mind, is even more important. Without unity and concerted effort, both participation in war and production will go wrong." ... After group deliberation and mass meetings, everyone unanimously agreed that "the three major events are one. Protecting Chairman Mao and fighting down Old Chiang are guarantees for a good life. Organizing and helping each other in production are guarantees for the livelihood of the front and rear. Washing faces and resolving grievances, so everyone is of one mind, and unity to achieve meritorious service is fundamental." Based on this understanding, cadres of various departments first proposed the conditions for taking the lead in participating in war, production, and face-washing, expressing their determination to lead the masses in achieving meritorious service; militiamen proposed to voluntarily go to the front line, guaranteeing not to surrender, not to desert, obeying orders and commands, and bravely killing enemies to achieve meritorious service. Young and middle-aged people in the self-defense forces proposed: to carry stretchers and do transportation on the front lines, guaranteeing not to desert, not to damage livestock, to take care of the wounded and sick, and to help each other to achieve meritorious service. The adults in the self-defense forces who remained at home proposed: to help each other in production, guaranteeing to first cultivate land for military families and those participating in the war (using exchange labor), and then cultivate their own land, not leaving a single mu uncultivated, and treating cultivated land for others and their own land the same way when harvesting grain. Women proposed: to organize textile production, guaranteeing to complete private and public cloth, guaranteeing to make clothes, shoes, socks, and dry food for those participating in the war, and also participating in plowing, weeding, and harvesting during the busy farming season. Elderly teams proposed: to take care of transporting public grain and grass, to entertain the army, and to manage village affairs. Children's corps proposed: to guarantee to carry water, collect firewood, and collect manure for military families, to help with production at home, to stand guard and keep watch, and to monitor the activities of little Chiang Kai-sheks. Military families automatically proposed: to reduce the amount of land cultivated for them and to participate in production mutual aid and household chores.

　　In this tense atmosphere, the village cadres and the masses, on the one hand, continued the "face-washing and one-heart" movement, and on the other hand, organized participation in war and production to launch a meritorious service movement. Village cadres took the lead, engaging in production during the day, brainstorming ideas during meals, and holding small and large meetings to discuss at night. They organized men to carry out shock production and cultivate 260 mu of land for military families, and most of the land has now been plowed. Women at home rushed to make clothes, shoes, socks, and dry food. The elderly transported grass and grain to prepare materials. After half a month, the cadres and the masses carried out mutual face-washing, mutual evaluation of merits, and mutual resolution of grievances, greatly improving the relationship between cadres and the masses. On this basis, a meritorious service committee was elected, which on the one hand evaluated households with difficulties, distributed the remaining fruits, and filled loopholes, and on the other hand, made a general evaluation of past merits and launched a meritorious service movement, establishing a front-line headquarters and a rear-area headquarters, and organizing rear-area support for front-line work. More than 40 stretcher teams and transportation teams and all necessary equipment, clothing, shoes, and socks were prepared. This time, as soon as the call to participate in the war was made, they rushed to the front line within three days; while the people in the rear, under the leadership of the rear headquarters, were actively resolving outstanding issues and actively engaging in production.

　　参战生产分田如何结合？
    崇义男女都出主意
    分订计划集体立功
    【本报特讯】武安八区崇义村二月经换平补齐，农民皆已获得土地（详细经过二月二十六日本报已介绍），为了彻底消灭封建，改造干部作风，充分发动“落后”群众，更加密切干群关系。三月末该村又进行了洗脸擦黑，解圪瘩，挖防空洞，填窟窿，评功劳的拥干爱民运动。这个运动刚达到高潮时，本月初，准备参战的紧急任务来到了，民兵、担架队、运输队、牲口须要随时准备出动，同时春耕下种的大生产任务也迫在眼前。这三件大事挤成一圪瘩，究竟那个重要？先做那个后做那个？怎样结合着做？哄动了全村男女老少，家庭里、巷子饭市里、纺织小组里、大学校小书房里、合作社里、妇女会、儿童团、老年队、农会、民兵、自卫队、生产互助组里，酝酿着、争论着。有的说：“保卫毛主席，赶走老蒋顶重要，就是地荒了，也要参战支援前线。”有的说：“上前线打老蒋重要，生产也重要，地也一亩不能荒。”有的说：“洗脸解圪瘩，大家一条心更重要，不团结、不齐心，参战生产都闹不好。”…………经过小组酝酿与群众大会，大家一致认为“三件大事是一个，保卫毛主席，参战打垮老蒋，好时光才有保障。组织起来，互助生产，前后方生活才有保证。洗脸解圪瘩，大家一条心，团结立功是根本。”依据这样了解，各部门干部首先提出：带头参战、生产、洗脸的条件，向群众表示决心领导立功；民兵们提出自愿上前线，保证不投降，不开小差，服从命令、指挥，勇敢杀敌立功。自卫队的青壮年们提出：上前线抬担架干运输，保证不开小差，不损坏牲口，爱护伤病员，互助立功。自卫队留家里的成壮年们提出：互助生产，保证先给军属代耕，给参战的代耕（换工办法），后耕自己地，不荒一亩地，代耕地和自耕地一样打粮食。妇女们提出：纺织组织起来，保证完成私用和公用布匹，保证给参战的做好衣服、鞋、袜、干粮等，农忙时还要参加耕锄和收割。老年队们提出：保管运输公粮公草，招待军队，管理村中杂务。儿童团提出：保证给军属担水、拾柴、拾粪，帮助家里生产，站岗放哨、监视小老蒋活动。军属们自动提出：减少代耕地，参加生产互助，建立家务。
    在这样紧张的气氛下，该村干部与群众，一面继续洗脸一条心运动，一面组织参战生产开展立功运动，村干带头，白天生产，饭场酝酿办法，晚上开小会大会讨论。组织男人突击生产，给军属代耕地二百六十亩，现大部地已犁完。妇女们在家赶做衣服、鞋袜、干粮。老年运草运粮准备器材。经过半月时间，干部与群众进行了互相洗脸，互相评功，互相解圪瘩，干群关系大大改善。在这基础上，选出了立功委员会，一面评议窟窿户，分配尚余存的果实，填窟窿，一面总评过去的功劳，开展立功运动，建立了前方指挥部，后方指挥部，组织了后方支援前线的工作。四十多付担架队和运输队及一切用具服装鞋袜都准备妥当，这次参战一号召，三天之内即赶赴前线了；而在后方的人，正在后方指挥部领导下，一面积极解决遗留的问题，一面积极搞生产。（子杰）
