　　[This article transmitted by the newspaper office in Wu'an] After solving internal problems, the cadres and masses of Sanwang Village in the Ninth District are more united. They are now thoroughly investigating feudalism while simultaneously launching a rush to spring plowing and actively preparing to participate in the war. After everyone's discussion, the village believes that as long as the mutual aid teams are sound, production in the fields during the day will be no problem, and meetings can be held again in the evening, so that both can be done without error. The masses' enthusiasm suddenly soared. Each mutual aid team set a rush week, guaranteeing that all cotton and sloping land in the team would be plowed within seven days, totaling more than 80 mu of unplowed cotton land and 150 mu of sloping land in the village. All the team members' manure was applied to the land, totaling more than 6,000 loads of manure for the entire village, with an average of 20 loads of manure applied per mu. There are still more than three qing of valley land whose manure has not yet been delivered (manure for cotton fields and wheat fields has been delivered). Women are guaranteed to complete 25 jin of cloth per person before the wheat harvest, and half has already been completed. Finally, it was proposed that there be a competition between groups, with the production results of each group broadcast on the radio station every night. After mobilization, there are now no idlers on the streets during the day. More than half of the village's autumn land has been plowed, and most of the ditching and embankment repairs have been completed, and all hemp has been sown. (Geng, Ju)

　　定出突击周街头无闲人
    三王村竞赛春耕
    【本报武安讯】九区三王村经过解圪瘩，干群更加团结，现正深入查封建，同时一面突击春耕，一面积极准备参战。该村经过大家研究，认为只要互助组健全，白天在地生产就圪扯，晚上回来再开会，这样做到两不误。群众情绪顿时高涨，各互助组定出突击周，保证七天中组内所有棉地坡地犁完，计全村未犁棉地八十余亩，坡地一百五十亩。组员的粪全部上到地里，计全村共有粪六千余驮，每亩平均上粪二十驮，现有三顷多谷地的粪尚未送（棉花地麦地均已送完）。妇女保证每人麦收前完成二十五斤布，现已完成一半。最后提出组与组竞赛，每晚由广播台广播每组生产成绩。经过动员后，现在白天街上已无闲人，全村秋地已犁过一半以上，刨边修堰大部做完，大麻已全部完成下种。（庚、居）
