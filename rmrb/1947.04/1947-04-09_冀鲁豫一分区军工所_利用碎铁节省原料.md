　　Jilu Yu No. 1 Military Industrial Plant
  　Saves Raw Materials by Using Scrap Iron
    [Our newspaper, Jilu Yu, 7th dispatch] Responding to the call of the Central Bureau, a wave of thrift is surging in various parts of Jilu Yu. Seventy percent of the staff of the Sixth Special Commissioner's Office are self-sufficient in all supplies, saving a total of 4,300 jin of rice in three months. The First Military Sub-district Logistics Vehicle Workshop dug out and utilized 30,000 jin of waste broken coke and tens of thousands of jin of scrap iron from the past, ensuring that no raw materials were wasted. The machine repair team reduced the amount of machine oil used by half, and the carpentry team also guaranteed: the medicine milling is precise, and the detonators are properly installed, ensuring that every bomb explodes. All forty-seven members of the Women's Training Class of the District Committee saved allowances, clothing, shoes, socks, sanitation, and medical expenses, and ten people saved single-layer clothing. After the production section of the Seventh Military Sub-district Rear Supply Department proposed thrift, cadres and miscellaneous personnel challenged each other, and their enthusiasm was unprecedented. When moving, they saved civilian labor and did not want to use large carts and civilian laborers. The director personally carried machines, and each platoon leader and warehouse keeper carried loads and pushed small carts, saving forty large carts and 120,000 Jilu banknotes in total. They immediately resumed work after the move was completed. The sub-district headquarters gave a special commendation.
