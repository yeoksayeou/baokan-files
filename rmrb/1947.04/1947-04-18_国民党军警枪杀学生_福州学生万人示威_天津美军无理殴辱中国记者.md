Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, April 12th: Fuzhou students held a demonstration of ten thousand people on the afternoon of the 26th of last month, petitioning the Kuomintang provincial government. Kuomintang military police shot and killed two people, causing a tragedy. The incident was triggered by the unreasonable beating and arrest of students by the Kuomintang police in Fuzhou. Students and teachers were enraged and gathered at the Fuzhou Police Department, resulting in a conflict with the police. On the 26th, it developed into a city-wide student parade. After the tragedy on the 26th, people from all walks of life in Fuzhou were extremely indignant and rose up in support.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, April 11th: According to Kuomintang News Agency reports: A recent incident occurred in Shanghai where Chiang's troops beat students of Tongji University, leading to a strike and protest.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, April 12th: According to a Central News Agency report: Another incident of American soldiers assaulting Chinese journalists occurred in Tianjin. At noon on the 8th, when Lieutenant General Gillen, commander of the American troops stationed in Peiping, arrived in Tianjin, more than ten Tianjin reporters were suddenly unreasonably expelled by two American military police while covering the arrival at the station. At that time, the American military police not only verbally abused the reporters in a barbaric manner, but also physically assaulted and shoved them. The reporters, feeling unduly humiliated, immediately held an emergency meeting and resolved to protest to the American military authorities.
