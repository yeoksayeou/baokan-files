　　Yangjiao Cadres and Masses Launch a Campaign to Compare Progress
  　Cadres Repeatedly Refuse to Share the Fruits
  　Masses Recognize Cadres' Great Contributions and Resolve to Follow Cadres
    [Our newspaper's dispatch from Zuoquan] During the final in-depth stage in Yangjiao Village, the work of rectifying relationships and squeezing out feudalism continued. Cadres and the masses launched a campaign to compare progress in their thinking. Conditions were first stipulated: (1) Ideologically breaking with the landlords. (2) Sharing the fruits and caring for everyone. (3) Cadres should have a democratic work style and work hard. During discussions, everyone agreed that the chairman of the Farmers' Association, the village head, and the political director were models. They not only returned the fruits they had received in the past, but also performed very well in the last distribution; the masses considered Farmers' Association Chairman Li Zhonghua, Village Head Wu Baojin, and Political Director Wang Huizhong to be first-class good examples. Li Zhonghua was supposed to receive eight jin of cotton and 20,000 yuan in paper money, but he firmly refused. The masses insisted on giving it to him. Comrade Zhonghua, seeing the masses' sincerity was hard to refuse, suggested that he only wanted a little. The masses resolutely supplemented Comrade Zhonghua with three chi of coarse cloth and a large poplar tree. Wu Baojin was supposed to receive one shi of corn and six jin of cotton. He firmly declined twice, but the masses recognized him as a great example and refused to let him decline. Wang Huizhong is a retired soldier. The masses recognized him as a special-class good example and wanted to give him 30,000 yuan. He firmly declined three times. In the morning, everyone gave him a leather jacket, but Comrade Huizhong still didn't want it. The masses insisted on giving it to him. In the end, he took the small leather jacket but gave back four trees and over 40,000 yuan. The masses all said they were good cadres, truly working for us. Some of the masses conducted self-criticisms. Zhang San's self-criticism said: "I haven't made progress in this movement. When the cadres called meetings, I refused to go two or three times. When they spoke loudly, I still complained about their attitude. I didn't think that the cadres hadn't gone out to produce all winter and couldn't sleep half the night. They haven't cut firewood for several months, and the cadres didn't get much of the fruits, but we got a lot, and we're still not satisfied with them. Where can you find such good cadres? In the past, I was oppressed by the landlords. Even if they killed me, I wouldn't dare say a word. Chairman Mao led us to turn over, and we have such a status in society. I am infinitely grateful. In the future, I can only follow the good cadres and Chairman Mao to make progress, turn the fruits into production capital, work hard to produce, and live our good times." In the discussion in the four street groups, everyone also found Wang Jiuchang of the district cooperative. His thinking was separated from the landlord. Wang worked as a cook in the district cooperative and came back to mobilize his younger brother Wang Baochang (who had married the landlord's daughter) to take out eight bundles that he was keeping for the landlord, with over a hundred pieces of silk clothing. When Wang Jiuchang mobilized his younger brother, he said, "In the past, we farmed rented land and couldn't pay the rent to the landlord. We were oppressed. Have you forgotten? Why are we still protecting him?" Everyone said, "Jiuchang has made a great contribution." In the discussion, it was also found that a farmer, Wang Micheng, had not broken with the landlord in his thinking. When the landlord Wang En came to the cooperative to buy cloth, he undercharged him 300 yuan. After reflection by the group, he realized that he had sympathy for the landlord. Wu Fuqiang said, "You pity the landlord? Does the landlord pity you? Have you forgotten how the landlord scolded you?" One sentence opened up his thinking and made him realize that he hadn't made progress. Now the entire village, men and women, old and young cadres, are in a hot wave of comparing progress.

　Model Cadres' Inspiration
　Twelve Farmers Voluntarily Report Secretly Stealing Fruits
    [Another dispatch] Liu Xi, the vice-village head of Nanyugou, Yangjiao village, fifth district and twelve other farmers stole one *dalian*, one pocket, one reed mat, one large wooden chest, and over ten items from the masses' fruits. During the in-depth movement, they began a major ideological examination. During the discussion, Qiao Hanting was moved when he saw that Farmers' Association Chairman Li Zhonghua didn't take much of the fruits and helped Wang Xicheng return the fruits he had taken too much of, and he reflected on it in the people's school. He said: "We twelve people stole the fruits of the masses, which is unfair to the masses. Everyone gave me quite a lot of the fruits, and I still stole the fruits. It's only right that everyone should beat and scold me for doing this." After he said this, Ren Haitang asked him: "Did you return the stolen goods because you heard the masses' reflections, or did you return them because you realized it was wrong?" Hanting said: "I returned them because I realized it was wrong, not because everyone reflected it." Then Chen Tiantang said: "It is progress to admit mistakes and correct them. He is our farmer. As long as he doesn't do this again in the future, we can forgive him." After speaking, everyone dispersed the meeting with a smile. (Zemin, Yuxi, Zhiquan)

　　羊角干群开展比进步运动
  　干部再三拒分果实
  　群众认清干部功劳大决心跟着干部走
    【本报左权讯】羊角村在最后深入阶段中，继续贯彻整关系，挤封建。干部与群众展开思想比进步运动。首先规定了条件：（一）思想上和地主分家。（二）分果实关心大家。（三）干部是作风民主，工作艰苦。讨论中大家认为农会主任、村长、政治主任是模范。他们不仅退出过去果实而且在最后一次分果实中仍表现很好；农会主任李忠华、村长武保金、政治主任王惠忠，经群众讨论他们为第一等圪道。李忠华应分棉花八斤、票洋二万元，但他坚决不要，群众非给他分不行，忠华同志看到群众诚意难却，他提出只少要一点就行了，群众继又坚决另补给忠华同志三尺粗一个大杨树。武保金应分玉茭一石，棉花六斤，他坚向群众退过二次，群众公认他是大圪道，不叫退。王惠忠是荣退军人，群众公认他是特等圪道，给分洋三万元，他坚向群众退了三次，晨后大家又给他分了皮袄一件，惠忠同志还是不要，群众非分给他不行，最后他要下了小皮袄，但又退出树四棵，洋四万余元。群众都说他们是好干部，真心为咱们。有的群众进行了自我检讨。张三的自我检讨说：“这次运动我不进步，干部叫开会，三、二次叫不去。人家叫的声音大，还嫌他态度不好，没想干部一冬天没有出去生产，在家一熬半夜不能睡。几个月没有割柴，干部分果实不多分，咱们不少分，还对人家不满意，这样好干部去哪找？我过去受地主压迫，人家就是杀了咱的头，咱也不敢吭。毛主席来领导咱翻了身，在社会上有这样地位，感谢不尽恩情，以后只有跟上好干部和毛主席走，才能进步，把果实变成生产资本努力生产，过咱好时光。”在四个街小组会讨论中，大家又找到区联社王九昌，思想和地主分了家，王在区联社做饭，回来动员他弟王保昌（已和地主闺女结婚）拿出给地主保存包袱八个，有百余件绸缎衣服。王九昌动员他弟时曾说：“咱过去种租地，给地主交不上租，受压迫，你忘了，咱还包庇他干啥？”大家都说：“九昌功劳大”，讨论中又发现一个农民王米成思想未和地主分家，地主王恩的到合作社买布，他少算洋三百元，经小组反省，他有可怜地主思想。武富强说：“你可怜地主？地主可怜你不？你忘了地主怎样骂你来？”一句话打通了他的思想，认识了自己不进步。现全村男女老少干部正在比进步热潮中。（泽民、玉喜、执全）
　模范干部的感动
　十二农民自报私偷果实
    【又讯】五区羊角编村南峪沟副村刘喜等十二个农民，偷群众果实中的搭连一个、口袋一条、席子一领、大板箱一个、大小共十余件东西。在深入运动中，展开思想大检查。在讨论中有乔韩廷看到农会主任李忠华不多分果实，并帮助王喜成退出多分果实，感动的他在民校上反省出来。他说：“我们十二个人偷了群众果实，这是对不起群众的。大家给我分的果实很不少，我还偷果实，我办这事大家就打我骂我，也应该的。”他说罢，就有仁海堂问他：“偷果实是听群众反映你才退？还是你想通不对退？”韩廷说：“是我想通才退的，不是大家反映退。”接着有陈天堂说：“知错认错，就是进步，他是咱农民，今后只要不犯这事，咱就可原谅他。”说罢后大家笑着散了会。（泽民、玉喜、执全）
