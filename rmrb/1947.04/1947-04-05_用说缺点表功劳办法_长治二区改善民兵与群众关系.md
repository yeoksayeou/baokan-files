　　Using Criticism to Demonstrate Merit
    Changzhi Second District Improves Relations Between Militia and Masses
    [Our Newspaper, Changzhi News] In the Changzhi Second District, during the transformation of the militia on the basis of the peasants' armed consciousness, some peasants initially did not recognize that the militia was their own armed force, thinking that the militia was the same as the district police and village police of the past. Some even said the militia were "soldier seedlings" (meaning preparing to be soldiers). At the same time, because some militia members had a bad attitude towards the masses, it caused dissatisfaction among the masses towards the militia. First, mass discussions were launched, raising the questions of whose armed force the militia was, what the militia should do, and what the militia was like now. Then, the masses were asked to give their opinions on the militia. Wang Si of Nantianhe said: "When the militia went to my house, I was afraid. When I saw someone carrying a gun, I felt like it was the security team." Gao He Village's Qi Suo's wife said: "Jin Wang (a militiaman) piled a lot of manure in front of my door, and I didn't even dare to say a word." Under these circumstances, the leadership guided the discussion on whether all militia members were bad, and whether they had made any contributions. Guo Liu of Gaohe said: "Zhang Baoyuan (a target of struggle) from our village ran away, and the militia ran two or three hundred li to catch him back. On the way, they picked up a package and automatically returned it to the owner at the Nanzhang meeting. How exemplary this action is!" Wang Laishui said: "If the militia didn't call us to meetings every day, we wouldn't be able to turn ourselves over." Jia Zhang's Liu Zhangshuang said: "If the militia didn't dare to act, the enemies at Xiaoyao Shang (enemy stronghold) wouldn't be able to leave! How could we live in peace?" In this way, the masses and the militia reached a consensus. Under the slogan of arming ourselves to protect the fruits of our emancipation and defending the good times, 779 young and middle-aged people in the district consciously rose up to join the militia, purging 57 bad elements, and electing 181 model militia members. They swore to protect the fruits of the masses' emancipation with their lives. (Lin Tang, Zhi Xing)

　　用说缺点表功劳办法
    长治二区改善民兵与群众关系
    【本报长治讯】长治二区在农民武装自觉的基础上，改造民兵，起初有些农民不认识民兵是自己武装，认为民兵和过去的区警、村警一样。还有的说民兵是“兵秧”（准备当兵的意思），同时由于有些民兵对群众态度不好，引起群众对民兵不满。首先开展群众性的讨论，提出民兵是谁的武装，民兵究竟应当干些什么，现在民兵如何？接着便让群众给民兵提意见。南天河王四有说：“民兵去了我家，我就害怕，瞧见人家背着枪就觉着象保安队”。高河村七锁老婆说：“金旺（民兵）把一大堆粪堆在我门口，我连声也不敢吭。”在这样情况下，领导上便引导讨论民兵是否都不好？是否有过功劳？高河郭六则说：“咱村张保元（斗争对象）偷跑了，民兵跑了二、三百里路把他抓回来，在路上拾了个包袱，自动在南漳会上给了失主，这行动该有多模范！”王来水说：“不是民兵每天叫咱开会，咱就翻不了身。”贾掌刘章双说：“不是民兵敢干，小窑上（敌据点）的敌人就走不了！咱还安生？”这样群众民兵思想一致了。在武装起来保卫翻身果实保卫好时先等口号下，全区七百七十九个青壮年自觉起来参加民兵，清洗出坏分子五十七个，并评选出一百八十一个模范民兵。他们宣誓，誓死保卫群众翻身果实。（林堂、枝兴）
