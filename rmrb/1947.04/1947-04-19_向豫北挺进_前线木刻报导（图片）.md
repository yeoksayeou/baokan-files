Advancing to Northern Henan
Frontline Woodcut Reports
·Engraved by Ai Yan·
(1) The People's Liberation Army, in dozens of routes, is advancing towards Northern Henan. When we enter the KMT-occupied areas, the people all come out to watch. When our army is stationed in a place, the people all say: "You have finally come! We've been waiting to death for you!"
(2) On the evening of March 26th, while our army was advancing towards Northern Henan, a certain unit fiercely attacked Niusitun, annihilating Zhang Mingqing's Security Brigade, a total of more than 1,000 men.
