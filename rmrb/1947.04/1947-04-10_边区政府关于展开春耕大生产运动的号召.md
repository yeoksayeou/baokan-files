The Border Region Government's Call to Launch the Spring Ploughing and Production Campaign

　　Spring ploughing has arrived, and the entire region should quickly launch a large-scale production campaign.

　　Fellow compatriots who have turned over a new leaf! Everyone must know that to achieve a complete turnaround, it is not enough to merely divide the land and pull out the roots of poverty. It is also necessary to enthusiastically launch a large-scale production campaign to become prosperous. First, it is necessary to organize, compete with each other, and ensure that spring ploughing is universally sown this year, so that every village has no idle people, and every family has no barren land. Strive together to achieve the goals of "tilling three and having a surplus of one," becoming prosperous, and supporting the war!

　　Compatriots, comrades! Only with a successful spring ploughing can we have a successful autumn harvest. Only with guaranteed military and civilian supplies can we accelerate the victory of the counter-offensive on the front lines. Therefore, we must immediately take action and intensify the mobilization work for spring ploughing.

　　Over the past year, cadres at all levels have devoted all their energy to the sacred patriotic self-defense war and the great task of land reform. Model deeds of serving the people have emerged everywhere, which are worthy of praise. In particular, the district and village cadres are the most busy and arduous, and all work must be realized through their efforts. Among all local cadres, merit-based rewards should be given to them first. Now that spring ploughing has arrived again, the task is very important, and this is a basic link in supporting the war. District and village cadres, I hope you will further strive to do a good job in spring ploughing and production. Labor heroes and technical experts, you have already become people's heroes, and in the future, you should invent and create more, and promote the role of backbone leadership.翻身的英雄们，you should become labor heroes in the great production campaign and add merit upon merit.

　　In the great patriotic self-defense war, the main difficulties of spring ploughing are the lack of labor and animal power. If it is not resolved in time, it will delay the farming season, reduce harvests, and even cause land to be barren. The solution is to first establish and develop labor mutual aid. The old liberated areas should immediately reorganize mutual aid groups, carry forward the experience of war support and combining agricultural and sideline production with work accounting, and integrate front (war support) and rear labor, animal power, agriculture, and sideline production. On the basis of equivalent exchange, implement precise calculations, exchange work, and mutual aid to give play to the power of further organization. And send cadres to the new liberated areas to spread the experience of organization, and universally develop spring ploughing mutual aid work in the new liberated areas. In areas where animal power is more scarce, it is necessary to promote joint plowing. In areas where sideline production is developed, we should adjust the profits of agricultural and sideline production and strive to absorb some sideline production capital, manpower, and animal power into spring ploughing.

　　It is also necessary to use various methods to increase livestock, such as using sideline production profits and struggle gains or raising funds by cooperatives to purchase livestock, as well as joint purchases and joint feeding, etc., which should be adopted according to local conditions as much as possible.

　　Another important task to solve the difficulties of labor and animal power is to strictly implement the new corvée labor method, reduce the burden of corvée labor on the people, accurately calculate participation in war service, and save civilian labor. Generally, corvée labor transportation should be reduced as much as possible and methods should be found to combine transportation with production. During the sowing period, all corvée labor should be stopped except for urgent war mobilization.

　　In this year's spring ploughing production campaign, another important issue is to particularly promote and study the methods and experiences of combining production, war, and land reform. For example, in areas where land reform has been largely completed, more attention should be paid to the production campaign, seize spring ploughing, and continue to solve outstanding issues in the gaps in production. In areas where land reform is relatively poor, although land reform is the main focus, spring ploughing and sowing should not be delayed. In war zones, strive to ensure that war support and production are not neglected. In border areas, it is necessary to combine labor and military, and carry forward the spirit of holding a gun in one hand and a hoe in the other. In the process of land reform, land rights have not yet been determined, but all lands must also be sown to prevent land from being barren. Otherwise, once the season passes, it will cause a disaster, which will not only be a loss to those who have been allocated land.

　　In addition, we must remind the masses to prevent drought and flood, and save for disaster preparedness. Our region often lacks rain in the spring, so we must oppose the idea of ​​paralysis and waiting, and promote early plowing, early harrowing, and early sowing, preparing to store water, dig wells, and spot sow, etc. This year, the Yellow River is bound to flood, so it is necessary to promote the planting of early-maturing and high-stem crops, as well as aquatic crops suitable for the area, to prevent floods.

　　Regarding the planting of cotton, indigo, tobacco, etc., the financial offices of governments at all levels should make unified plans, some of which should be encouraged to plant more, and blindness should be prevented.

　　Due to the urgency of the war and various tasks, the preparations for spring ploughing in various places, such as sending manure, plowing the land, and building embankments, started late. In order to complete the spring ploughing well and solve the difficulties of the masses, we specially call on all cadres to participate in spring ploughing. All rear organs, troops, and schools, in addition to their own production, must squeeze out labor and animal power to help the masses with spring ploughing and sowing, even if they can only help for three days. During the sowing period, all levels of schools shall have holidays. All newly reformed criminals detained by the public security and judicial departments (except for serious offenders) shall be put into mass production or organ production. Governments at all levels should quickly organize technicians and doctors to prevent and control the spreading cattle plague, pig plague, and chicken plague, so that it is convenient to call for help and go deep into the masses to prevent and treat various diseases of humans and animals.

　　Cadres should personally help check and issue loans to ensure that loans are issued to poor farmers, and guide and promote the credit and loan relationships between cooperatives and the masses.

　　In short, everything must be for spring ploughing, and various methods must be used to help the masses in production. In leadership, pay attention to overcoming all ideas that hinder prosperity among cadres and the masses, and pay more attention to inspection and supervision to prevent leadership from going with the flow, and oppose the saying that "the masses will produce by themselves without leadership."

　　Everyone mobilize, launch a large-scale production campaign in the entire region, and all cadres and activists should launch a competition to make meritorious service to the people in production!

### 边区政府关于展开春耕大生产运动的号召

　　边区政府关于展开春耕大生产运动的号召
    春耕已经到了，全区应很快的展开大规模的生产运动。
    翻身的广大同胞们！大家须知要达到彻底翻身，单分得土地拔了穷根还是不够的，还须热烈的展开大生产运动，发家致富。首先要组织起来，互相比赛，作到今年春耕普遍下种，使村村无闲人，家家无白地，一致为达到耕三余一、发家致富、支援战争的目标而奋斗！
    同胞们，同志们！必须有胜利的春耕才能有胜利的秋收，军需民食有保证才能加速前线的反攻胜利。因此，必须马上行动起来加紧春耕动员工作。
    一年来各级干部以全部精力紧张的进行了神圣的爱国自卫战争与土地改革的伟大任务，为人民立功的模范事迹到处涌现，值得表扬。尤以区村干部为最繁忙与艰苦，一切工作必须通过他们的努力才能实现。在所有地方干部中，论功行赏当首推第一。现在春耕又到，任务十分重大，这是支援战争的基本一环。区村干部同志们，希望你们更进一步奋发做好春耕生产工作，劳动英雄、技术能手们，你们已为人民功臣，今后应更多发明与创造，发扬骨干带头作用；翻身英雄们，你们应在大生产运动中成为劳动英雄，功上加功。
    在伟大的爱国自卫战争中，春耕的主要困难是劳力畜力不足；若不及时解决，就会有误农时、减少收成，甚或造成土地荒芜。解决的办法，首先要建立和发展劳动互助。老区立即整理互助组，发扬战勤支差与农副业结合计工变工的经验，把前方（支差战勤）后方劳力畜力农业副业。在等价交换的基础上实行精确计算，变工互助，发挥更进一步组织起来的力量。并要派干部到新区去传播组织起来的经验，普遍发展新区春耕互助工作。在畜力较缺地区，就要提倡合伙拉耧拉犁；副业发展地区则应调剂农副业利润，争取吸收一部副业资本人力畜力转入春耕中去。
    还要用各种办法做到增加牲畜，如以副业利润和斗争果实或由合作社筹资购买牲口，以及伙买伙喂等，要因地制宜，尽量采用。
    解决劳畜力困难的另一重要工作是严格执行新的支差办法，减轻人民支差负担，精确计算参战勤务，节约民力。一般支差运输要尽量减少并设法和运输生产相结合。下种期间除迫切的参战动员外，停止一切支差。
    在今年春耕生产运动中，再一个重要问题就是要特别提倡和研究生产、战争和土地改革结合的办法与经验，如土地改革已大部完成地区，要多注意生产运动，抓紧春耕，在生产空隙中继续解决遗留问题。在土地改革较差地区，虽以土地改革为主，也不要耽误春耕下种。在战争地区，力求战勤生产两不误；边沿区要劳武结合，发扬一手拿枪一手拿锄的精神。在土地改革过程中地权尚未确定者，也要全部下种，勿仟土地荒芜。否则季节一过，造成灾荒，就不仅是分得土地者的损失。
    此外还须提醒群众防旱、防水，节约备荒。本区常常春季缺雨，必须反对麻痹等待的想法，提倡早耕、早耙、早种，准备储水、打井、点种等等。今年黄水为患，势所必然，凡在易致水灾地区，要提倡种植早熟和高茎作物，以及适于该地区的水中作物，以防水灾。
    关于棉花、蓝、烟草等的种植，应由各级政府财办统一计划，有些要提倡多种，并要防止盲目性。
    由于战争和和各工作的忙迫，各地春耕准备工作如送粪、犁地、垒堰等，着手较迟；为了很好的完成春耕解决群众困难，我们特号召全体干部参加春耕，所有后方机关、部队、学校，除自己的生产外，必须挤出劳力畜力帮助群众春耕下种，至少能帮助三天也好。各级学校下种期间，一律放假。公安、司法部门羁押的自新人犯（除重犯外），一律投入群众生产或机关生产中去。各级政府迅速组织技术人员及医生，防治正在蔓延的牛瘟、猪瘟、鸡瘟，做到请唤方便，深入群众，防治人畜各种疾病。
    干部要亲自帮助检查发放贷款，保证要将贷款发到贫苦农民手里，并指导和发扬合作社和群众间的信用借贷关系。
    总之，要一切为了春耕，用各种办法帮助群众生产，在领导上注意克服干部和群众中一切妨害发家致富的思想，并多抓紧检查督促，防止领导上的自流现象，反对认为“不领导群众也自己会生产”的说法。
    大家动员起来，展开全区的大生产运动，一切干部积极分子要在生产方面展开为人民立功的竞赛！
