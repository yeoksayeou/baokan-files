　　Jinnan Liberated Peasants Form 300 Litters to Go to the Front Lines
　　[Report from this newspaper in Jinnan on the 7th] The liberated peasants of Nangong and Wei counties, more than 400 miles away from the JiluYu front lines, have formed 300 litters to go to the front lines. The young and middle-aged men participating in this litter team are in extraordinarily high spirits. Shi Shangxie from Hejia Village said: "I was allocated 1.3 mu of land and 3,000 yuan. To protect my fruits, I am willing to carry a litter. Our group guarantees to fight Old Chiang to the end and will not run home halfway." Ma Lichang from Dong Village said: "Our village is poor and small, and we don't have many fruits of struggle, but the government lent our village 500,000 yuan to buy livestock and fertilizer. I borrowed 15,000 yuan to engage in production. My life has just gotten better, and I know that things won't be over until Old Chiang is defeated." The 300 litters are led by Jiao Jingyao, director of the Armed Forces Committee, to the front lines.

　　冀南翻身农民组成三百付担架上前线
    【本报冀南七日电】远距冀鲁豫前线四百余里的南宫、威县翻身农民组成三百付担架开赴前线。参加这次担架的青壮年，情绪异常高涨。纥家庄史尚协说：“我分了一亩三分地，三千块钱，为保护我的果实，我愿去抬担架。俺这一伙，保证给老蒋干到底，不能半路跑回家”。东村马利常说：“俺村又穷又小，没有很多斗争果实，可是政府贷给我村五十万元，叫买牲口、买肥料，我贷了一万五千块钱搞生产，我日子刚过好了，我知道不打散老蒋事情完不了的。”三百付担架由武委会主任焦景尧率领奔赴前线。
