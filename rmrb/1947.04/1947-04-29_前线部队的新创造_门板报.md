　　New Creation of the Frontline Troops
    ——The Door-Panel Newspaper
    Kang Jian
    In the blazing war to defend Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia and protect Chairman Mao, the Yi unit of our JiluYu Frontline Forces is deeply engaged in a campaign to achieve merit. Specifically, to realize "everyone achieves merit, everything achieves merit," they created the campaign of finding the good, recording the good, learning the good, and the door-panel newspaper of the company branches.
    Every night, the soldiers freely gather together to find each other's good deeds. While marching, they find the good deeds while soaking their feet after entering a house. After a battle, finding good deeds is combined with a review meeting. Every soldier and cadre finds their achievements from the day's actions, and if everyone agrees, it is recorded in the "Record the Good" notebook. Then, a literate person in the squad writes (or draws) a manuscript and posts it on the branch's door-panel newspaper for praise (sometimes with criticism).
    The door-panel newspaper is simply a door panel erected in the troop gathering place at each campsite. Upon receiving manuscripts, they are reviewed and modified. Whether the paper is triangular, square, torn, or wrinkled, as long as something is written, it is posted. Because the requirements are low, anyone who can write, writes, and those who cannot write can draw. It is highly relevant; usually, what happened yesterday can be seen on the door-panel newspaper at breakfast today. It is widely popular; in the Liu-Chen regiment, the number of people participating in writing for the door-panel newspaper accounts for more than 37% of the total number of people in the regiment, with the highest being the special service company, reaching 83%.
    The campaign to find the good, record the good, learn the good, and the creation of the door-panel newspaper have been in place for less than a month. The mass praise method of officers praising soldiers, soldiers praising soldiers, and soldiers praising officers has transformed the appearance of the troops.

　　前线部队的新创造
    ——门板报
    康健
    在保卫陕甘宁，保卫毛主席的烈焰中，我冀鲁豫前线毅字部队，立功运动深入开展，具体实现“人人立功，事事立功”，创造出找好，记好，学好运动和连队支部的门板报。
    战士们每天晚上，自由的集合一起，相互找好，行军时则在进房子之后，大家边汤脚边找好，战斗下来，找好结合检讨会，每个战士、干部每天都从一天的行动中找出成绩，大家同意就记到记好本上，并由班里识字人写成（或画书）稿子，贴到支部出版的门板报上表扬（有时也有批评）。
    门板报就是每到宿营地，便竖一块门板在部队集结场所，收到稿子，经审阅修改，不管是三角四方破皱纸张，只要写了就贴上去。因为要求低，能写就写，不会写可画画。现实性强，通常昨天的事今天早饭就可在门板报上看见。群众性大，刘陈团参加门板报写稿的人数占全团总人数百分之三十七强，特务连最高达百分之八十三。
    找好，记好，学好运动及门板报创造出来不到一月，官表扬兵，兵表扬兵，兵表扬官的群众性的表扬方法，使部队换了一个样子。
