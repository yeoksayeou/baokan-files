　　The war in Yu-Wan-Su Intensifies and Expands Westward
　　Our Army Recovers Taikang and Tongxu
　　In Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia, We Capture Anse; Enemy Attacks Yanchuan in Vain
　　[Report from the Yu-Wan-Su Front, 1st] The war in Yu-Wan-Su is expanding westward. Our army recovered Taikang on the morning of the 27th of last month. The entire Guo Xinbo unit of the Chiang army's security brigade in the city was annihilated. The results of the battle are currently being tallied.
　　[Report from the Yu-Wan-Su Front, 2nd] A unit of our army in Yu-Wan-Su recovered the city of Tongxu on the 30th of last month.
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 31st] This agency's reporter visited the headquarters of the People's Liberation Army in a certain location in Northern Shaanxi on the 30th and inquired with the headquarters' spokesperson about the recent situation in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region. The spokesperson stated: On the 25th, our army annihilated the enemy's 31st Brigade headquarters and one regiment, capturing Li Jiyun alive. On the 28th, our army also recovered Anse County. Since the 26th, Hu's army has been doing everything in its power, launching attacks on Yanchang and Yanchuan in three routes. On the 28th and 29th, our army actively withdrew from both cities, and Hu's army suffered another futile attack. The spokesperson said: Since Hu Zongnan's invasion of the border region half a month ago, he has been recklessly attacking like a mad dog, and now he has suffered two futile attacks in a row, losing two brigade commanders. The fatigue of his troops and the decline in morale are imaginable. Hu Zongnan is blindly running around like a blind man. Our army is waiting at leisure for the exhausted enemy. We will not strike unless we are sure of victory. There is no reason for Hu Zongnan not to be defeated. Hu Zongnan's ferocity will soon pass. The more frantic Hu Zongnan becomes, the faster his arrogance will collapse.

　　豫皖苏战事向西猛烈扩展
    我军收复太康通许
    陕甘宁我克安塞敌犯延川扑空
    【本报豫皖苏前线一日电】豫皖苏战事向西扩展，我军上月二十七日晨收复太康，该城蒋军保安旅郭馨波部全部被歼灭，战果正清查中。
    【本报豫皖苏前线二日电】豫皖苏我军一部，于上月三十日收复通许城。
    【新华社陕北三十一日电】本社记者于三十日在陕北某地，访问人民解放军总部，向总部发言人叩询近日陕甘宁边区战况，发言人称：二十五日，我军歼灭敌三十一旅旅部及一个团，活捉李纪云后，二十八日我军又收复安塞县城。胡军自二十六日起，竭尽全力，分三路窜犯延长、延川。二十八、二十九两日，我军主动撤出该两城，胡军又一次扑空。发言人说：胡宗南窜犯边区半月以来，像疯狗一样到处乱扑，现在已经一连扑空两次，又损失了旅长两个，基部队之疲劳，士气之消沉，可想而知。胡宗南像瞎子一样，到处乱撞，我军则以逸待劳，不出手则已，一出手必胜，胡宗南没有理由不败，胡宗南的凶焰不久就会过去。胡宗南越是疯狂，他的凶焰也就倒得越快。
