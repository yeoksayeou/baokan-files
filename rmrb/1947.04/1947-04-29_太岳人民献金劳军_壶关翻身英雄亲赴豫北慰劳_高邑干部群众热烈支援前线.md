(Zong Chang)
    [This newspaper, Gaoyi dispatch] Cadres and masses throughout Gaoyi County are involved in this upsurge of "everything for the victory of the front lines." Cadres of various agencies have left only one or two people to maintain operations, with the majority of cadres going to the front lines to lead the masses in breaking roads and supplying the troops. The Finance and Grain Section bears the main responsibility for supplying the troops. To better handle the supply problem, the deed tax work has been temporarily suspended. The tax deed workers have become supply personnel in the rear, spending their days grinding flour in the villages and sending vegetables and grain to the front, while also organizing stretcher teams and other work. The masses of the entire county are grinding white flour and sending provisions and vegetables to the troops day and night. The majority of the masses follow the troops to the front to break roads, and they are so excited by the victory that they work day and night. (Qiao Lin)
