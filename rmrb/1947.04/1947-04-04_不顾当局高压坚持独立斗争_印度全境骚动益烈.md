　　Defying the Authorities' High-Pressure Tactics to Persist in the Struggle for Independence
    Unrest Intensifies Across India
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st] According to a New Delhi dispatch: The great unrest of the Indian people has continued to expand throughout India. From the Bay of Bengal to the Arabian Sea, from the Kabul Pass in the northwest to the Indian plains, there are large-scale disturbances. News of riots, strikes, and arrests continues to come from Bombay, Calcutta, the Northwest Frontier Province, the United Provinces, Bihar, Assam, and other places. Local newspapers report these events in prominent positions, causing the news of the Pan-Asian Conference currently being held to be placed in a secondary position. In many places, the police have even opened fire on the masses. In Bombay, 40 people died and 137 were injured in a single day on the 20th. The mass unrest in Calcutta has continued for seven days. In Delhi, following several assassination attempts, martial law has been extended for seven days. The masses in various places are expanding this struggle for independence. The tribes in the Northwest Frontier Province are also very agitated, and Kuomintang [Note: I believe this is a typo in the original newspaper - it is likely meant to say "Muslim League"] elements are also planning to launch a large-scale mobilization in Assam Province.

　　不顾当局高压坚持独立斗争
    印度全境骚动益烈
    【新华社陕北一日电】据新德里讯：印度人民大骚动已经在印度全境继续扩大，从孟加拉湾到阿刺伯海，从西北的喀布尔山口到印度平原，都有大规模的骚动。孟买、加尔各答、西北边省、联合省、比哈尔、阿萨密及其他各地，不断传来骚动、罢工及逮捕等消息。各地报纸均以显著地位报导此等消息，致使正在举行的泛亚洲会议的新闻，也不得不置于次要地位。很多地方警察竟向群众开枪，在孟买二十日一天之内死四十人，伤一百三十七人。加尔各答群众的骚动已继续了七天之久，在德里方面也继多次刺杀案之后而延长戒严七日。各地的群众正在扩大这种争取独立的斗争。西北边省各部落亦甚激动，回盟分子亦拟借此在阿萨密省大规模地发动。
