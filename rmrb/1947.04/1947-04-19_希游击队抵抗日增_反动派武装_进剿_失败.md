　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th: TASS, Athens dispatch: As the Greek government forces penetrate deeper into the central highlands, the resistance of the Greek guerrillas is increasing daily. At a press conference, Greek Chief of Staff, Lieutenant General Unidakis, admitted that hopes of getting the guerrillas to surrender had been dashed. He affirmed: The headquarters of General Markos, commander of the Greek Democratic Army, is not within the government forces' encirclement. Reports from all over Greece confirm that, in addition to major battles in Macedonia, Thrace, and other places, guerrilla activities are taking place all over Greece, and they frequently capture villages.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th: TASS dispatch: The Soviet Central Council of Trade Unions recently received a letter from Greek trade union organizations exposing the suppression of the democratic trade union movement by the Greek monarchist government. The Greek government has dissolved the Central Bureau of the General Confederation of Labor and replaced all trade union leaders with people distrusted by workers, and even non-trade union members. Many of them are elements who collaborated with the Nazis. The new "leaders" of the General Confederation of Labor expel those who refuse to obey their decisions from the General Confederation of Labor. To support the leadership of the new "trade union," the Ministry of Labor ordered employers to deduct wages from workers and office staff as funds for the new trade union. All trade union gatherings have been banned. Terrorist tactics against leaders of democratic trade unions have increased. In just a few weeks at the end of last year, twenty-nine leaders of democratic trade unions were killed. Almost all the leaders of democratic trade unions in various cities have been arrested, convicted, or deported. According to a TASS dispatch from Prague: An Englishman, Tudor, who just arrived in Czechoslovakia from Greece, reported on the situation in Greece, saying: "If any law exists in Greece today, it is the law of aggressors."

　　希游击队抵抗日增
    反动派武装“进剿”失败
    【新华社陕北十六日电】塔斯社雅典讯：因希腊政府军深入中部高地，希腊游击队的抵抗正日益增强。希腊参谋本部乌尼达克斯中将在记者招待会上，承认想让游击队投降的希望已经破灭了。他确言：希腊民主军司令马尔科斯将军总部并不在政府军包围之内。全希各处报导证实：除在马其顿、色雷斯等地有主要战斗外，全希腊各地均有游击队活动，且时常攻克村庄。
    【新华社陕北十三日电】塔斯社讯：苏联职工中央委员会顷接获希腊职工团体来函，揭露希腊君主专制政府对民主职工运动所进行的压制。希腊政府已经解散总工会中央局。并以工人不信任的人、甚至非职工会会员代替所有职工会领袖。他们中有许多是曾与纳粹合作的分子。总工会的新“领袖”把拒绝服从他们决定的分子，从总工会中黜退。劳工部为支持新“职工会”的领导，命令雇工们抽提工人和机关人员的工资，作新职工会的经费。所有职工团体集会已被禁止。制约在民主职工会领袖的恐怖手段业已增加。仅在去年年底几个星期之内，就有廿九个在民主职工会领袖被杀害。几乎所有各城市的民主职工会领袖被逮捕、判罪，或驱逐出境。另据塔斯社布拉格讯：甫自希腊抵捷克之英人都德报告希腊之情势称：“假如说今天在希腊还存在有任何法律，此法律便是侵略主义者的法律”。
