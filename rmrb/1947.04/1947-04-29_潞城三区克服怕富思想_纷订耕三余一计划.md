　　Lucheng Third District Overcomes Fear of Getting Rich
    Vigorously Subscribes to the "Cultivate Three, Reserve One" Plan

　　[Report from this newspaper, Lucheng] The Third District held a production meeting on the 7th attended by over 500 village cadres, labor heroes, technical experts, activists, honored retired soldiers, and model military dependents. The meeting resolved the following three muddled ideas that hindered the development of the production movement:

　　(1) During the land reform movement, some villages did not pay enough attention to uniting with middle peasants, causing many village cadres and masses to have thoughts such as "cutting the leeks [i.e., excessive redistribution], fearing struggle, and not daring to get rich." The leadership immediately seized upon this key point and announced our policies to everyone, calling on all villages to conduct detailed inspections, re-inspections, and further re-inspections. If any damage to the interests of middle peasants was found, compensation should be given. If any "loopholes" of feudal remnants were discovered, the masses should be further mobilized to continue the struggle. On the spot, a village cadre from Rujiao Village inspected and found that a large landlord in his village had not been thoroughly struggled against, which greatly stimulated the cadres. The entire meeting unanimously agreed that land issues should be resolved more quickly in production. The more thoroughly the masses are mobilized, the more thoroughly the feudal landlords are struggled against, the more fairly the land is distributed, the closer the relationship between cadres and the masses, and the greater the enthusiasm of the masses for production.

　　(2) Due to participation in the war and the military, various villages lack labor. Those who attended the meeting felt that it was difficult to achieve "cultivate three, reserve one" and deep and meticulous cultivation. Even coarse cultivation and rough work were difficult enough to get enough to eat and wear. Villages such as Xipo, Dongjia, Heshi, Shenzhuang, Hehou, Zhongcun, and Manliu were all complaining that there was no way to achieve this. After everyone discussed and calculated, they all believed that organizing and accurate calculation would provide a solution. Shi Changmu, the political director of Xipo, said: "In the past, landlords who cultivated 120 mu of land only hired three long-term laborers. Now, is it impossible for one person to cultivate 40 mu of land? Furthermore, if we organize children, old men, and women, we will have even more solutions. In our village, there are 30 old men who can be equivalent to 15 full laborers, 10 women with unbound feet who can be equivalent to five full laborers, and four older children over the age of twelve who can be equivalent to two full laborers. After such precise calculations, the entire village, in addition to those participating in the war, still has about 70 full laborers. Each person only averages 30 mu of land. When it comes time for sending manure, plowing, sowing, and transplanting seedlings, even semi-laborers can be used as full laborers. Now that those participating in the war have not yet left, we must make another sprint for a few days, and the sowing in our village will not be a problem." After everyone debated and calculated accurately, this problem was unanimously resolved.

　　(3) Two kinds of thoughts emerged regarding "cultivate three, reserve one": one was complacency, and the other was discouragement. The head of the military affairs committee of Yangpo Village said: "Our village already achieved 'cultivate three, reserve one' last year, and it will still be a problem this year." The village chief of Shiliang Village said: "Our village even achieved 'cultivate one, reserve five' last year. Achieving 'cultivate two, reserve one' this year will not be a problem for the entire village." Heshi San said: "Our village is a poor village, and it will take another two years to achieve 'cultivate three, reserve one.' It would be almost possible if each family raised a donkey (one-quarter of a donkey), but it won't work like this." A cadre from Hehou Village said: "If we want to achieve 'cultivate three, reserve one,' our village must have each family raise a head of livestock." After inspection, cadres from Shiliang calculated the accounts of two households and found that neither achieved "cultivate three, reserve one," which greatly surprised the cadres and overcame complacency. Qin San, the political director of Qiaobao, said: "Ma Jiliang's family in our village cultivates 19 mu of land and can only produce 17 shi of grain (equivalent to 10 shi of rice). They do not have enough labor and cannot achieve 'cultivate three, reserve one.' But her daughter is twelve years old and knows how to spin foreign yarn, producing one tael per day, and can spin for eight months a year, spinning 15 jin. Each jin can be sold for 3,200 yuan, and 15 jin of yarn can be sold for 48,000 yuan, which, according to the local market price, can be converted into 10 shi and 6 dou and 5 sheng of rice, exceeding 'cultivate three, reserve one.'" Wei Yuansheng, a hero from Weijiazhuang, said: "Our village recently transported two loads during the sprint of sending manure and harrowing land, earning 250,000 yuan." At this time, all villages conducted inspections and calculations, breaking the above two kinds of thoughts. Each village then, based on its actual conditions, competitively subscribed to plans to achieve "cultivate three, reserve one" through a combination of agriculture and sideline occupations. At the meeting, cadres actively proposed making contributions to the people in the great production movement and launching the labor hero Wei Yuansheng and technical expert Liu Jubao movements. They have now returned to their villages to accumulate fertilizer and lead the masses in spring plowing. (Tu Chang, Fu Jin, Wang Jian, Qi Cun)

　　潞城三区克服怕富思想
    纷订耕三余一计划
    【本报潞城讯】三区于七日召开的村干部、劳动英雄、技术能手、积极分子、荣退军人及模范军属五百余人的生产会上，解决了如下三个妨碍开展生产运动的糊涂思想：
    （一）土地改革运动中，有个别村子对团结中农注意不够，引起不少村干部群众存在着“割韭菜，怕斗争，不敢发财”等思想。领导上当即抓住这个关键，向大家宣布我们的政策，叫各村应详细检查再检查，复查再复查，如有损害中农利益的，给以补偿，如发现封建尾巴“漏洞”者，继续发动群众，继续斗争，当场有儒教村干部检查他村还有一家大地主未斗透，这样对干部有极大刺激。全场一致认为生产中应加速解决土地问题，群众发动越彻底，封建地主越斗透，土地分配越公道，干群关系越密切，群众生产劲也越大。
    （二）参战参军，各村劳力缺乏，到会者，同感达不到耕三余一和深耕细作，就粗耕粗作够吃够穿也很困难，西坡、东贾、合室、申庄、河后、中村、漫流等村，都是吵着没办法。经过大家讨论、算账，都认为组织起来，精确计算就有办法。西坡政治主任史长木说：“过去地主种一百二十亩地只雇三个长工，现在一个人种四十亩地就不行了吗？再要把儿童、老汉，妇女组织起来，就更有办法，我村有三十个老汉能顶十五个全劳力，十个大足妇女能顶五个全劳力，十二岁以上的大儿童有四个，能顶两个全劳力。这样精确计算后，全村除参战还留七十来个全劳力，每人才平均三十亩地，要到送粪、犁地、播种、拔苗时，半劳力都能顶全劳力用，刻下参战未走，要再突击几天，我村下种就不成问题了。”经过大家争论，精确计算后，这个问题一致得到解决。
    （三）对于耕三余一，产生了两种思想：一种是自满，一种是泄气。杨坡村武委会主任说：“我村去年已达到耕三余一，今年还成问题。”石梁村长说：“我村去年还有达到耕一余五的呢。今年全村达到耕二余一不成问题”。合室三则说：“我村是个穷村，再等二年就可达到耕三余一，要一家喂上一条驴（四分之一的驴）就差不多能作到了，照这样是不行。”河后村干部说：“要想达到耕三余一，我村得一家喂上一头牲口才行。”石梁干部经检查，算了两户账，都达不到耕三余一，干部才大吃一惊，克服了自满思想。桥堡政治主任秦三则说：“我村马骥良家种十九亩地，只能产十七石谷（折米十石），并无劳力，不能达到耕三余一。但她闺女十二岁啦，会纺洋线，每天就以一两计，一年能纺八个月，可纺十五斤；每斤能卖三千二百元，十五斤线就能卖四万八千元，按当地市价，可折米十石六斗五，达到耕三余一还有长。”魏家庄英雄魏元盛说：“我村最近在突击送粪、耙地中运输了两趟，赚了二十五万元。”这时各村都进行检查与算账。打破了以上两种思想，各村便根据本村实际条件，争先恐后的订了农副业结合达到耕三余一的计划。会上干部纷纷提出在大生产运动中，为民立功，开展劳动英雄魏元盛与技术能手刘聚宝运动，现已返村积肥领导群众春耕。（土长、辅晋、王健、起存）
