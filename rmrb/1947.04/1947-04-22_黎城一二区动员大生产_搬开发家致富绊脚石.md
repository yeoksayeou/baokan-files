[Reported by our newspaper from Li Cheng] On April 10th, the Second District convened an enlarged meeting of district-level cadres, heroes, model workers, and activists to mobilize for large-scale production. Leaders encouraged everyone to conduct thought-visiting, discover typical examples, and solve everyone's ideological problems. The district was divided into four mixed groups to address the following ideological issues and clarify the guidelines for this year:

1.  From the current demands of the masses, clarify the overall goal of this year's work. Liu Aizhen, a woman from Qiaogou Village, said: "The women in our village report that all 30 looms in the village are primitive. Without workers, we cannot transform them into hand-cranked machines." The Women's Rescue Committee member from Wangbei Village said: "The women in our village often tell me that other villages have no shortage of tools, but our village doesn't even have enough primitive looms, and everyone is very worried." Niu Haiyang, a labor hero from Taipei, said: "The emancipated farmers in our village report a lack of manure and say that doing business requires capital, and farming requires manure." Each village, based on its specific circumstances, raised different demands from the farmers. The leaders immediately pointed out: "What is the central purpose of everyone raising so many demands?" Shen Yuqin, a labor hero from Renzhuang, said: "There is no other purpose. The overall goal is to produce well and become prosperous. Who doesn't want to live a good life!"

2.  Through debate on the two tasks of production and participation in the war, they recognized that becoming prosperous is the central task this year. Wang Shuqun from Gaojiajiao immediately said: "That's right, we farmers used to think about land so much that we got sick. Although we have been emancipated today, we are still just an empty shell. Production is essential, but fighting without grain is also useless." Cheng Peiqin, a militiaman from Chengjiashan, said: "The central task is to fight Chiang Kai-shek. If we can't eliminate the Chiang army, production won't help." Jia Lao Si from Gaojiajiao said: "To defeat Chiang Kai-shek, we still have to produce well and turn ourselves completely around." After half an hour of back-and-forth argument, the mother of the deputy village chief of Longwang Village stood up and said: "Land is a gold mine. No one can do anything without land. Isn't it always said that the army doesn't move without food and fodder first? I say production is still the central task." Jin Meiyu from Yuanjiazhuang continued: "Yes, I agree. We don't plant crops just to grow weeds. I say that even before participating in the war, we must produce every day when we are at home." All the men, women, old, and young people in the audience stood up and scrambled to speak, unanimously agreeing that only by producing well can we become prosperous, and the rich will become even richer.

3.  In the discussion of becoming prosperous, complacency was exposed. The leaders asked, "What is the goal of becoming prosperous this year?" A cadre from Beiliu Village said nonchalantly, "It won't be a problem for the village to achieve two-thirds cultivation and one-third surplus this year." The leaders then suggested doing a specific calculation. Shi Cunlian from Beiliu Village said: "Newly emancipated households are buying horses but can't afford saddles. Expenses are high, and income is low. Every move costs money. They got houses but no doors. It's very difficult for my neighbors to achieve three-thirds cultivation and one-third surplus." After a specific calculation, everyone realized that the newly emancipated households had difficulties and said that not only should they not be complacent this year, but they should also work twice as hard as last year. Agricultural and sideline production must be implemented throughout the year, and all labor and livestock power in the village must be organized to truly make the most of the mountains and rivers, make the best use of people's talents and materials, ensure that no one is idle, meet the needs of the masses, and complete the guidelines for this year's large-scale production campaign.

4.  Two obstacles to completing the large-scale production task: In a free debate, Cao Genhe, the village chief of Dongbei Village, said: "There is a saying in our village that production is just for pleasure, to eat well and dress well. Therefore, there is a bullock cart transportation team. People save money, but they are stimulated and say that people come into the world to eat and wear, and you are just stingy (uncooperative)." The village chief of Yushuping Village said: "There is also waste in our village. After reviewing what we ate and what we excreted in 1943 in the people's school, and through individual education, we gradually overcame it." In addition, some well-to-do middle peasants are not enthusiastic about production, fearing that they will be cut like leeks. As soon as they are called rich peasants, they become discouraged.

Based on the above situation, the central work for April is: (1) To carry out a major mobilization of production thought, widely publicize the direction of "time is gold," boldly and democratically rectify mutual aid teams, rapidly launch the movement, harrow fields, hoe wheat, transport manure, and implement the 100-day weaving movement, etc., and continue to investigate feudal remnants and check the fruits of labor in the movement. Within the next month, thoroughly investigate and resolve unfair distribution of fruits and individual feudal remnants that have not been completely eradicated, so that cadres and the masses can unite and concentrate on production with peace of mind.

    黎城一二区动员大生产
    搬开发家致富绊脚石
    放手民主整顿互助组
    锄麦耙地中继续查田
    【本报黎城讯】二区于四月十号召开全区扩大干部英雄模范积极分子会议，进行大生产动员，领导上启发大家访思想，发现典型，解决大家思想问题，采用全区混合划分四组，解决以下几个思想，明确今年方针：一、从访群众目前要求中明确今年工作之总目标。桥沟村妇女刘爱珍说：“我村妇女反映，全村三十架织布机，都是土机，没有工人不能改造手拉机。”望北村妇救常委说：“俺村妇女经常对我说，人家村工具都不缺乏，咱村连土机也不够用，大家很发愁。”台北劳动英雄钮海羊说：“我村翻身农民反映缺粪料，并说做买卖要有本，种地要有粪。”各村根据各村具体情况，提出各村农民不同要求。领导上即指出：大家提出这样许多要求，中心目的是为甚？仁庄劳英申玉芹说：“没有别的，总目的是为好好生产，发家致富，那个不愿过好天气！”二、辩论生产参战两个任务中，认识了发家致富是今年中心。高家脚王书群紧接着说：“对的，咱农民过去想地想成病啦，今天虽然翻身，还是个空架子，不生产不行，打仗没粮也不行。”程家山民兵程培钦说：“中心是为打蒋介石，消灭不了蒋军生产下也不顶事。”高家脚贾老四说：“要想打败蒋介石，还得好好生产翻透身。”你一言我一语，争吵半点钟，隆旺村副村长母亲站起来说：“地是刮金板，没地谁也不能干，那个时候不是兵马不动粮草先行，我说还是生产中心。”苑家庄靳美玉接着说：“对，我同意，咱种地不是叫长白草哩，我说未参战以前在家一天就要生产一天。”全场男女老少都站起来抢着说，一致认为只有好好生产才能发家致富，富者更富。三、讨论发家致富中，暴露出自满情绪。领导上提出今年发家致富的目标是什么？”北流村干部满不在乎的说：“那村今年达到耕二余一都不成问题。”领导上又提出应用具体算账来一个计算。北流村石寸莲说：“新翻身户是买起马制不起鞍，开支大收入少，抬手动脚就花钱，分到房没有门，俺邻家达到耕三余一就很困难。”经过具体算账，大家才认识新翻身户有困难，说今年不但不应自满，而且还应该比去年加倍努力，农副业一定贯彻全年，把全村所有劳畜力组织起来，真正做到靠山吃山，靠水吃水，人尽其材，材尽其用，保证不闲一个人，满足群众要求，完成今年大生产运动的方针。四、完成大生产任务中两点障碍：在自由争论中，董北村长曹根河说：“我村有这样一个说法，生产就是为了痛快，好吃好穿，所以有一个牛车运输队，人家省吃俭用，反受到刺激，并说人来世上为吃穿，你们真是个克扣货（不开通之意）。”榆树坪村长说：“我村也有浪费现象，经在民校中回顾四三年吃的是甚，屙的是甚，及个别教育慢慢克服了。”此外，有些富中农，生产情绪不高，怕割他韭菜，一叫他老财他就灰心。根据以上情况，提出四月份中心工作：（一）进行生产思想大动员，普遍宣传石寸金方向，大胆放手民主整顿互助组，迅速开展运动，耙地锄麦运粪及贯彻百日勒织运动等，从运动中继续查封建尾巴，查果实。在最近一月内彻底检查解决果实分配不公，及个别封建尾巴未割彻底者，使干群团结一致，共同集中安心进行生产。（二区通讯小组集体研究，王怀璧执笔）
