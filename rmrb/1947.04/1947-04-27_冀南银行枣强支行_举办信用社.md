Jinnan Bank Zaoqiang County Branch
Organizes Credit Cooperatives

　　[This newspaper's Jinnan dispatch, 24th] In March of last year, the Zaoqiang County Branch of Jinnan Bank, in cooperation with the Third District government, piloted a credit cooperative in Daying Town, Third District. It called on businesses, farmers, and village cooperatives to pool shares and established the Xinfeng Silver Shop, attached to the Hongcheng Cooperative. The total capital was 176,000 yuan. At the end of June, after accounting, the net profit was 376,700 yuan. Because the town was relatively prosperous, in order to play a greater role, the cooperative affairs meeting decided to operate independently from June 1st of last year and expand capital. Credit lending was expanded from the town to the countryside. In the second phase, the number of cooperative members soared to 338 (originally only 42), with farmer members accounting for 70 percent, and capital increased to 1,313,000 yuan, with farmer capital accounting for 60 percent. In business operations, credit interest rates were determined according to the nature of the loan: commercial loans were the highest, industrial loans the lowest, and agricultural loans were generally demand loans. The cooperative also accepted stored goods and adjusted drafts. The shop had overdraft relations with 32 businesses and 3 rural cooperatives, reducing draft procedures for merchants and the people, and providing interest on deposits, which was quite convenient. It absorbed floating capital, often as much as 6-7 million yuan, enlivening the market, helping rural small loans, and earnestly implemented anti-counterfeit bill work, detecting counterfeit bill smuggling. At the end of February, after accounting, the net profit was 3.6 million yuan. After two shareholders' meetings, it was resolved to continue to expand capital and purchase real estate. The third phase of profit distribution was changed to once a year. Currently, capital has increased to 3.3 million yuan, with 410 members.
　　
　　[Another dispatch] The masses in the Fourth and Fifth Districts of Zaoqiang, hearing that rural credit in the Third District was active, have successively requested to establish stock cooperatives. The Fourth District established the Jucheng Credit Cooperative, stipulating capital of 3 million yuan, of which more than 1 million yuan has now been collected. In addition to credit lending, a iron factory has been established to manufacture agricultural tools for farmers' needs. The Fifth District established the Tonghang Credit Cooperative, with capital set at 3 million yuan, of which more than 2 million yuan has now been collected.

　　冀南银行枣强支行
    举办信用社
    【本报冀南二十四日电】冀南银行枣强县支行于去年三月协同三区政府，在该区大营镇试办信用合作社，号召商号、农民、村合作社集股，成立信丰银号，附设于红成合作社内，计资金十七万六千元，六月底结账，得纯利三十七万六千七百元；因该镇比较繁荣，为发挥更大作用，经社务会议决定，从去年六月一日开始独立经营，扩大资本，信用借贷由该镇扩大到农村，到第二期社员激增到三百三十八名（原只四十二名），农民社员占百分之七十，资金增加到一百三十一万三千元，农民资金占百分之六十。在业务经营上，信贷利息根据性质而定，商贷最高，工贷最低，农贷一般是活期贷款，其次是吸收存货与调剂汇票。该号与商号来往透支三十二家，农村合作社三家，商民减少汇票手续，存款又得利息，颇称便利，吸收游资，经常有六、七百万元，活跃了市面，帮助了农村小本借贷，并认真执行了反假票工作，查获假票走私。二月底结账，计得纯利三百六十万元，经二次股东会议议决，资本继续扩大，并购置房产。第三期结账分红改为一年。现资金增到三百三十万元，社员四百一十名。
    【又讯】枣强四、五两区群众，闻三区农村信贷活跃，纷纷要求召股建立。四区成立聚成信用合作社，规定资本三百万元，现已集中百余万元，除信贷外，设立铁工厂一处，现已开始制造农具，供给农民需用。五区成立同行信用合作社，资本定为三百万元，现已集中二百余万元。
