Chen Wangping, Du Gengchao, Xu Xianzhou, Liu Guanchen, and others saved 2,400 yuan in prize money earned for meritorious service during the war and used it to support the front lines. Comrade Jin Fuheng also saved his annual allowance and a set of single-layer clothing. Mayor Zhang also quit smoking cigarettes. Influenced by Mayor Zhang, many comrades in the city government also quit smoking. In addition, everyone engaged in gathering firewood and wild vegetables, cutting more than 4,000 jin of firewood in four or five days. The comrades are very enthusiastic. Qin Qingmao, Li Ling, and Jin Fuqing each gathered more than 100 jin of firewood per day. In this way, 350 yuan of firewood can be saved every day. (Du Gengchao)
