　　Capture of Houma
　　Lang Qiao
　　On the afternoon of the 4th, a long column, seemingly without end, advanced at a speed of 16 li per hour on the plains towards the outskirts of Quwo Houma. At midnight, the ninth squad of the first battalion captured the independent blockhouse east of the city in a fifteen-minute battle, removing the obstacles to approaching the walls of Houma.

　　The next day, reconnaissance personnel and commanders at all levels, under enemy fire and aircraft bombing and strafing, meticulously reconnoitered and organized the combat steps. At dusk, the battle to scale the city began. The newly emancipated soldiers and liberated soldiers of the second battalion vied to storm the southeastern corner of the city. Their stubbornness demonstrated the heroic nature of the patriotic self-defense war. They bravely crossed the outer moat by erecting springboards and ladders under enemy fire. The ladders were knocked down by the enemy, and some were injured as a result. Combat hero Yang Zhongquan immediately organized a second charge, and all kinds of artillery shells and countless hand grenades exploded on the city walls. One by one, the wall forts fell. The enemy on the city wall was stunned. Squad leader Li Zhaoxiang's erection team raised the pole high, and with a whirring sound, the ladder extended up the wall. Jia Chengxiang closely followed Li Zhaoxiang up the city wall, and the enemy had already fled without a trace.

　　After entering the city, the troops advanced in depth. The officers and soldiers of the Chiang Kai-shek's 49th Regiment hastily abandoned the fortresses they were defending and fled to Xinxicheng (western Houma). On the eastern city wall, the reporter saw a Chiang Kai-shek soldier who had been stunned by the explosion huddled in a bunker.

　　After our army entered Houma, the commander of the Chiang Kai-shek's 49th Regiment in Xinxicheng, which was surrounded by even stronger fortifications, once again pretended to recite Hu Zongnan's urgent order for his subordinates to "defend Houma to the death," but soon he himself secretly fled first and was captured by our army. When the brave soldiers charged into Xinxicheng with bayonets, what they encountered was not a "death grip," but cheers and thunderous applause from more than 2,000 officers and soldiers of the 49th Regiment and the 27th Brigade welcoming our army.

　　进占侯马
    朗樵
    四日下午，长得望不见头尾的行列在平原上以每小时十六里的速度进到了曲沃侯马外围。半夜，一营第九班以十五分钟的战斗占领了城东的独立碉堡，扫除了接近侯马城墙的障碍。
    第二天，侦察员和各级指挥员在敌人炮火与飞机轰炸扫射下，周密的侦察和组织了战斗步骤。黄昏，蹬城战斗开始了。二营的翻身新战士和解放战士争抢着向城东南角突击。他们的倔强，表现了爱国自卫战争中的英雄本色。他们在敌人火力下架跳板、搭梯子，勇敢地越过外壕。梯子被敌人摔倒了，有的因此负了伤。战斗英雄杨忠全立即组织起第二次冲锋，各色各样的炮弹和无数的手榴弹一齐在城墙上爆炸了。墙堡一个一个倒下去了。城墙上的敌人惊得发了呆。班长李兆祥的架设队将撑竿高举起来，梯子呜的一声伸上了墙。贾城祥紧跟着李兆祥爬上城头，敌人已经逃跑的无影无踪。
    进城后的部队向纵深发展，蒋军四十九团官兵慌张的放弃了据守的堡垒，逃向新西城（侯马西部）去。在东城墙头，记者看见一个被震昏的蒋军在碉堡内缩做一团。
    我军进入侯马城后，在环有更坚强工事的新西城里的蒋军四九团团长再次装腔作势的给部下背诵胡宗南要他们“死守侯马”的急令，可是不久，他自己却先偷跑而被我军俘虏了。当勇敢的战士们端着刺刀冲进新西城时，碰到的不是什么“死守”，而是四十九团和二十七旅两千多官兵欢迎我军的欢呼和震耳的掌声。
