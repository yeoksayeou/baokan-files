　　Yongxing Printing Bureau Factory No. 1
  　Increases Production by Onefold in January
  　Female Workers Show Their Skills in Production Increase Competition at Factory No. 2
    [Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper] Yongxing Printing Bureau Branch Factory No. 1 produced more than 1,985,600 characters in March, exceeding the average output of 950,000 characters before February by more than onefold. The quality was improved to clear characters, eliminating typos. After all the workers in the factory launched the campaign to support the front line and make contributions from March 1st to "May Day," the production enthusiasm of the worker comrades was greatly enhanced. Although the working hours remained at nine hours per day, they all worked until around 10 o'clock. Apprentices in the typesetting department used the evenings to learn page layout. The plate casting department often worked for twelve hours; one day they worked continuously for nineteen hours, and still worked as usual the next day. Old worker Qiao Fujiang said, "I have been working in the printing factory for eight or nine years, and I have never seen such intense and enthusiastic production enthusiasm." The movement particularly emphasized cultivating young workers and improving skills. "Old hens" supported young workers, and workers and apprentices taught and learned from each other. Many apprentices who had just joined the factory were able to get on the typesetting rack, or could perform plate making, engraving, and other work. The skills of many workers have simply improved by leaps and bounds. For example, Comrade Pan Yanlian, who had only been learning typesetting for seventy days, sorted 2,525 "gui" characters on March 10th, sorted and typeset 5,522 characters on the 15th, and then sorted and typeset 7,056 characters on the 20th. Within ten days, the technology improved five and a half times! Li Wenlin usually sorted and typeset 7,000 to 8,000 characters every day, but in the movement, he created an unprecedented record of sorting and typesetting 13,000 characters. As for the quality, in the past, an average of 20 to 25 typos were made per thousand characters, but now it has reached no more than ten typos. In the past, an average of four proofs were required to sign off on a draft, but now, except for medical books (because there are specialized terms and foreign languages), two proofs can be signed off. In the past, lead plates often had blurred characters or were uneven, but now, because the lead characters are uniform and the engraving department cleans them with engraving knives after the plates are cast well. The workers said, "Now the lead plates, as soon as they are on the machine, make a 'clang' sound, and the characters are clear and the strokes are careful." Other things, such as correcting typos on paper plates and correcting typos on lead plates, have eliminated typos and saved ink, paper, manpower, and time that cannot be statistically calculated. Secondly, the movement created a bold leadership method. In the past, the production plan was formulated administratively, and it was held on to and not released, often resulting in a solo performance. The current production plan is formulated jointly by the administration and the trade union and handed over to the trade union to guarantee its implementation. Manpower allocation, worker leave, etc., are all handled by the trade union. This not only exerted the role of the trade union, and the trade union's prestige increased accordingly; it also strengthened the masses' enthusiasm for production and leadership. For example, Qin Yubao of the typesetting department carefully arranged the work order for Comrade Xiao Wuhao for the day, which greatly promoted the work. The administration can also concentrate more energy on grasping the overall production plan of the factory, and the relationship between the cadres and workers is also a step closer than before. Furthermore: layer-by-layer responsibility, mutual inspection, group production, and individual registration. For example, the typesetting department guarantees that the plates are laid flat and the rules are arranged properly, otherwise, the plate casting department will find out and send them back for rework; the proofreading department can check how many typos someone has made; but if typos are found in the second proof, the typesetting department will in turn check the work of the proofreading department. Although production is separated into groups, how much each individual produces and how good the quality is are registered by person. (Leng Bing, Wang Hua)
    [Another News] In the twenty-day meritorious service campaign at Yongxing Factory No. 2, the enthusiasm of the employees was unprecedentedly high. Everyone competed to make contributions. In addition to ten hours of work every day, they gathered for morning exercises before dawn, and after dinner, there was lively entertainment work. At work, there was a mutual comparison of merits between departments and between people, especially the couple's competition. Female comrades showed their skills greatly, and there were significant achievements in output, quality, and material saving. Model young worker Comrade Wang Yongtai has not rested for a single day since the beginning of the movement. In the past, he averaged 4,000 to 5,000 sheets printed per day, but now he averages more than 7,000 sheets per day. In the individual competition, female worker Yin Xiang used to fold 3,500 pages per day, but now she folds 5,000 double-sided pages, totaling 20,000 small pages of finished products. Zhao Meilin and her husband Li Xinmin competed in folding pages. In the past, they folded more than 3,000 pages per day, but now they fold 4,500 large pages, totaling 18,000 small pages of finished products, each page regular and without half a typo. As a result, the judgment was tied. They broke their hands and bled, without any complaints, breaking unprecedented records. Under their influence, many comrades proposed to learn from female comrades. Let's look at the output of each department: In the lithography department, for fine work, the average was 684 sheets per day in the past, but now the average is more than 800 sheets per day. In the machine department: the four-open machine averaged about 9,000 sheets printed per day in the past, but now it averages more than 11,000 sheets. In terms of savings, the factory saved a total of 1,725 jin of coal, and most of the glue cooking stoves were replaced with coal sludge instead of large charcoal, saving 125 jin of paper scraps, equivalent to more than 30,000 yuan.

　　永兴印刷局一厂
  　一月增产一倍
  　二厂增产竞赛中女工显身手
    【本报特讯】永兴印刷局一分厂三月份生产一百九十八万五千六百余字，超过二月份以前平均产量九十五万字的一倍以上；质量提高到字字清楚，消灭错字。该厂全体工友，于三月一日掀起至“五一”为止的支援前线立功运动后，工友同志的生产情绪大大提高，工作时间虽仍旧每日九小时，但均作到十点钟左右。排字部练习生利用晚间学习拚版。浇版部常作到十二小时；有一天连续工作十九小时，第二天仍照常工作。老工友乔福江说：“咱来印刷厂工作已八、九年，没见过这样紧张热烈的生产情绪”。运动中特别强调培养青工，提高技术，“老母鸡”扶植青工，工徒间互教互学。许多入厂不久的练习生均能上排字架，或会作打版、刻字等工作了。不少工友的技术简直是飞跃提高，如初学排字七十天的潘演廉同志，三月十号光归字二千五百廿五个，十五号归、排字五千五百二十二个；到廿号则归排七千零五十六字，十天以内，技术提高了五倍半！李文林平时每天归排七、八千字，运动中竟创造归排一万三千字的空前纪录。至于质量上，过去每千字平均排错二十至二十五字，现已达到不错十字；过去排草稿平均四次打样才能签字，现在除医书（因有专门名词和外国文）外，均能作到两次打样签字；过去铅版常有糊涂字或高低不平，现在因铅字齐，浇好版刻字部又用刻刀清理一遍。工友说：“现在的铅版，一上机器，吭当一声，字字清楚，笔笔周到。”其他如纸版上改错字，铅版上改错字等等，既消灭了错字，节省的油墨、纸张、人力、时间无法统计。其次在运动中创造了大胆放手的领导方法。过去生产计划是行政上订出来，又抓住不敢放，常常弄成唱独脚戏。现在的生产计划是行政、工会统一订出，交由工会保证执行。人力配备，工人请假等概由工会处理。这样既发挥了工会的作用，工会威信随之提高；又加强了群众对生产、领导等积极性。如排字部秦玉宝给小五号同志严密安排好一天的工作秩序，大大推进了工作，就是一例。行政上也可以更集中精力掌握全厂生产大计，干工关系也较前密切了一步。再其次是：层层负责、互相检查，分组生产、个人登记。如排字部保证版排的平，拚的规矩，不然，浇版部查出送回重搞；校对科可以检查某人排错多少字；但如第二次打样发现错字，排字部又反过来检查校对科的工作。虽然分开小组生产，而个人生产多少，质量好坏，又是按人登记的。（冷冰、王华）
    【又讯】永兴二厂在二十天立功运动中，职工情绪空前高涨，均争先立功，每天除十小时工作外，天不亮则集合早操，晚饭后则活跃着文娱工作，工作时进行了部与部，人与人之间互相比功，尤其夫妻竞赛，女同志大显身手，产量、质量、材料节约均有显著成绩，模范青工王永太同志，由运动开始至今没有休息过一天，过去每天平均印四千至五千张，现每天平均印七千多张。个人竞赛中的女工，银香同志，过去每天折书页三千五百张，现折双印五千页，合成品小页子两万。赵梅林和她的男人李新民折页竞赛，过去每天折三千多页，现折四千五百大页，合成品一万八千小页，张张规矩，不错半个字，结果评判不分胜败。他们将手磨破出血，毫无怨言，打破了空前纪录。在她们的影响下，许多同志提出向女同志看齐。再看各部的产量吧：石印部，细活类，过去每天平均六百八十四张，现每天平均印八百多张，机器部：四开机过去每天平均印九千左右，现平均印一万一千多张。在节约方面，全厂煤炭节约一千七百二十五斤，熬胶炉子大部改为煤泥膏代替大炭，节约纸边一百二十五斤，合洋三万余元。（良辅）
