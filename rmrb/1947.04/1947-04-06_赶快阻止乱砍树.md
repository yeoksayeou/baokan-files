　　Hurry to Stop Indiscriminate Tree Felling
    Spring is the season for planting trees, but what we see is not a large number of trees being planted, but a large number of trees being felled. In the past two or three days, no less than a hundred trees have been felled in Zhao Village, Wu'an, and trees are being felled elsewhere as well. We think this is very wrong. Trees are the fruits of our liberation and have the function of preventing drought and creating forests. They should be well protected and should never be felled indiscriminately. It is true that firewood is relatively scarce now, but we should organize the transport of coal to solve this problem.
    We hope that the newspapers will raise the vigilance of all localities, and we hope that the Construction Department of the Border Government will issue instructions prohibiting cadres in all localities from being responsible for protecting trees.

　　赶快阻止乱砍树
    春天正是植树时节，可是我们所看到的情况，不是大量植树，却是大量砍树。最近三、二日内，武安赵庄村砍的树不下百余棵，别的地方也在砍。我们想这太不对了，树木是我们的翻身果实，又有防旱造林的功用，应当好好保护，绝不应该乱砍。现在烧柴确是比较困难，但应组织驮煤来解决。
    我们希望：从报纸上提起各地的警惕，并希望边府建设厅发出指示，禁止各地干部应负责保护树木。
