Cadres and Masses Resolve Conflicts, Recognize Landlords as the Root of Evil
Cixian Deeply Launches Land Investigation
Shangchen Focuses on Uncovering Thousands of Mu of Hidden Land

[Report from our newspaper in Cixian] In order to further promote the land investigation movement, Cixian County has successively opened "Farmers' Conferences" at nine locations throughout the county, with over 15,000 participants. The students included village cadres, activists, advanced and "backward" masses. After a general mobilization on current affairs, they shifted to discussions on questions such as "Have we thoroughly turned ourselves over? Have the landlords been completely overthrown? What are the reasons for not turning over completely?" Cadres and masses discussed separately. Initially, cadres only wanted to talk about the good and were unwilling to self-criticize. The masses had opinions about the cadres but were afraid of "retaliation," so they were not active in speaking out. Nancheng in the Eleventh District put forward the positive slogan "No new people can come out of the old society; the shortcomings are given by the landlords" to guide the cadres. Shangchen, as a key point, further proposed "Talk about your thoughts to cure your worries." In this way, the cadres' resistant emotions towards leadership changed, and everyone said, "This is for our own good; we must speak well." At the same time, the discussion and speeches of the cadre groups and mass groups were promptly communicated back and forth to promote each other. Cadres who made good self-criticisms went to the masses and said, "How good is so-and-so cadre's self-criticism!" The opinions raised by the masses were also conveyed to the cadres, "What opinions did so-and-so raise about the cadres." This mutual promotion and encouragement made everyone more courageous to speak out. When the discussion reached a certain level, they mixed together to hold a general meeting to solve problems. The village chief of Zhongli Village in the Third District confessed: "The director of the Farmers' Association and I stole eight bundles of fruit together. I didn't dare use it myself, and I didn't dare return it to the masses. It really became a worry! This time, I must get rid of this worry." Li Daochun, chairman of the Farmers' Association in Nancheng, Eleventh District, said: "Once, I confiscated things from five landlords during the day, but at night I returned things to three of them. The landlord Hao Laoxiang invited me to dinner and gave me twenty yuan. I knew it was wrong, but I didn't dare refuse because I was afraid of him." Zhang Tian from Huangguanying in the Second District said: "I bought a mule, a product of struggle, for 30,000 yuan, and a cart for 10,000 yuan. I am determined to return them to the masses." Wu Qinglin, the village chief of Nancheng, said: "I used to be bullied by others. Today, when I became a cadre, I also bullied people. I would detain the masses if they said something wrong because I was afraid that the masses would tell the higher authorities that I was sheltering the landlords." After the cadres reflected, the masses were allowed to raise their opinions. Everyone raised many opinions about the cadres' shortcomings, and the cadres made self-criticisms one by one, stating their attitude. After the relationship between cadres and the masses was resolved, everyone was further guided to think "Has the struggle been thorough?" Wang Hefa from Nancheng said, "I have liquidated one landlord's property three times, and I haven't taken anything good from him. How can it be thorough?" At this time, everyone was mobilized to check where the landlords had taken their land and property. Shangchen, a key point in the Third District, immediately uncovered more than eleven *qing* of land. This land was all preserved by the landlords by means of false mortgages and false sales to their daughters, tenants, long-term workers, and relatives. For example, Liu Sanming in Tianzhuang preserved 30 *mu* of land under the name of increasing the wages of his long-term worker. The landlord Liu Furen rented 21 *mu* of land to his son-in-law. The tenant farmers in Qingheyuyu only wanted the landlord's land. Shi Cunying and Dou Nizi were allocated the landlord's land, but in fact, they were preserving it for the landlord. Last year, the landlord still went to the field to pick cotton and weighed it to keep for Dou Nizi. In Shenjiazhuang in the Third District, it was discovered that the land distributed last year was secretly rented back to the landlord. The masses said at the meeting: "It's not that everyone didn't want the land last year, because the distributed land still belonged to others, so they didn't want to bother with it." After these problems were found out, everyone realized that "the struggle is not thorough, and a thorough land investigation is necessary." Currently, more than 10,000 cadres and masses have graduated throughout the county and will vigorously launch the land investigation movement.

　　干群解疙瘩认清地主是坏根
    磁县深入开展查田
    上陈基点查出隐蔽地千亩
    【本报磁县讯】磁县为了更进一步的开展查田运动，全县分九处召开的一万五千余人的“农民大会”已先后开课，学生包括村干部、积极分子，先进与“落后”群众，经过时事大动员，后即转入“我们翻身彻底了没有？地主斗垮了没有？没翻透身是啥原因？”等问题的讨论。干部与群众分别讨论，起初干部思想光想说好的不愿检讨，群众对干部有意见，但怕吃“回马鞭”（报复的意思），发言也不积极。十一区南城提出“旧社会出不来新人物，缺点是地主给的”的积极口号引导干部。上陈基点更提出“谈心思去心病”。这样，村干部对领导上的抵抗情绪转变了，大家都说：“这是为了咱，咱可得好好说哩。”同时把干部组与群众组讨论发言情况，及时来回传达，互相推动，干部检讨好的即到群众中说：“某某干部检讨的怎样好！”群众提的意见也到干部中说：“某某群众对干部提的什么意见。”这样互相推动打气，使大家更大胆发言。讨论到一定程度时，便混合起来开大会，解决问题。三区钟里村长检讨说：“我和农会主任伙偷了果实八个包袱，自己也不敢用，向群众退不敢退，真成了心病了！这一次可要把这个心病去掉。”十一区南城农会长李道春说：“有一次白天没收了五家地主东西，黑夜就把三家东西退回去，地主郝老祥请我吃饭，并给我二十元，我明知不对，但因怕人家不敢不要。”二区黄官营张田说：“我用三万元贱买斗争果实骡子一条，用一万元买大车一辆，要决心退给群众。”南城村长武清林说：“我过去受人欺侮，今天我当了干部也欺侮人，群众一句话说不对就扣起，因为怕群众说话叫上级知道我包庇地主。”干部反省后，再让群众提意见，大家对干部的缺点提的意见很多，干部一一作了检讨，表明态度。干群关系解决后，进一步诱导大家“斗争彻底了没有”？南城王合法说：“我到一个地主家清算了三次，也没有拿人家一点好东西，怎样能彻底？”这时便发动大家检查地主把土地财产都弄那去了。三区上陈基点，当场即查出土地十一顷多，这些地都是地主用假典假卖给他闺女、佃户、长工、本家等替他保存。如田庄刘三明，利用给他长工增资名义，保存土地卅亩，地主刘甫仁，将地租给他女婿二十一亩。庆和峪村佃户光要地主家地，时村营、斗妮子分到地主地，实际是替地主保存，去年还是地主去地摘花，并过秤叫斗妮子保存。三区申家庄，发现去年分得地暗中还给地主出租子，群众在会上说：“去年不是大家不愿要地，因为分下地还是人家的，因此不愿闹那个麻烦。”这些问题查出后，“斗争就是不彻底，非彻底查田不行。”现全县已有一万余干部群众毕业，将猛烈开展查田运动。
