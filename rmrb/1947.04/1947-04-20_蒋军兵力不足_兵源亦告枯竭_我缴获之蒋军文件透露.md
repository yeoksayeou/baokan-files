Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 18th: The People's Liberation Army, upon liberating Juxing Town, Haimen on March 26th, seized Chiang's First Pacification Area Command's Teleorder No. 3, Sui, dated December 2nd of last year. The teleorder stated: "Every time troops are mobilized, requests for assistance are made, and pleas for troops are exchanged via letters and telegrams... This is not only unhelpful, but also reveals military secrets, which is highly inconvenient." Therefore, it shouted: "Focus on the overall situation; troop movements are part of a comprehensive plan, hence the division of urgency," and "similar incidents must not occur again in the future." It stipulated that "local telecommunications bureaus and military radio stations must not send such clear-text telegrams; otherwise, they will be charged with leaking military secrets." However, the fatal weakness of Chiang's troops' lack of manpower can never be resolved with a few orders. Taking the Hai(men) and Qi(dong) area as an example, the 435th Regiment of the 21st Division, after covering the local Chiang's puppet forces' invasion of Qidong at the end of last December, was soon transferred north to "suppress" the 314th Regiment of the 105th Brigade of the 49th Division in Hai(men) and Qi(dong). After only one month, it crossed the Yangtze River southward due to the emptiness of the Nanjing-Shanghai area. However, at the request of the local Chiang's puppet forces, it was recently transferred to guard the Dong(tai)-Hai(an) highway. Each time Chiang's troops are mobilized, the local Chiang's puppet forces shout, "If no main force is sent to take over, we fear we will be lost." But Chiang's troops' frequent movements, revealing their embarrassment, have made them feel deeply disappointed.
    
Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 18th: The conscription of men in Chiang's controlled areas has reached the point of exhaustion. On March 4th, the Tianjin Dagongbao editorial, under the title "Conscription in a Predicament, the Old, Weak, and Disabled Will Go to Battle," revealed that Chiang's Ministry of National Defense issued a new instruction in late February, stating: "If the number of conscripts of age in each county and city is insufficient to meet the quota, the age limit may be extended appropriately to achieve the quota." On the same day, the newspaper reported: Hebei Province's conscription quota last year was 36,275 men, but by the end of the year, only 26,300 men were conscripted, with about one-third of the quota unmet. The trend of buying and selling conscripts, substitution, and escape continues unabated. Furthermore, materials captured during the Ping-Han Campaign revealed that the buying and selling of conscripts in Ping City has become public, with the allocation of conscription funds to each street and household, ranging from 10,000 to 300,000 yuan per household, and the price of each conscript is 4 million yuan, but the hired person actually receives only about 1 million yuan. A telegram from Chiang's Third Army to the Ninth Special District of Hebei stated that the new recruits of the army "are mostly substitutes" and "it is stated that the limit is five months."

　　蒋军兵力不足
    兵源亦告枯竭
    我缴获之蒋军文件透露
    【新华社华中十八日电】人民解放军于三月二十六日，解放海门聚星镇缴获蒋第一绥靖区司令部去年十二月二日绥字第三号电令，该电称：“每逢兵力调动，求援呼吁、请兵函电交接……此独于事无补，且徒泄露军情，殊多不便。”于是叫喊：“以顾大局为主，兵力调动自有通盘计划，故有缓急之分”，“今后不得再有同类情事发生”，规定“各地电讯局及各军无线电台，不得拍发此类明码电文，否则以泄露军机论罪。”但蒋军兵力不足的致命弱点，是永远不能用几个命令解决的。以海（门）、启（东）地区为例，二十一师四三五团去年十二月底掩护土著蒋伪进犯启东后，不久即北调至海（门）、启（东）“清剿”之四十九师一○五旅三一四团刚驻一个月，又因二十一师调台湾，京沪空虚而渡江南下，但在土著蒋伪要求下，最近又调守东（台）海（安）公路。每次蒋军调动，土著蒋伪即大喊“不派主力接防，恐将不保。”但蒋军调动频繁，窘态毕露，又使彼等备感失望。
    【新华社晋察冀十八日电】蒋管区壮丁已临枯竭之境。三月四日，天津大公报社论以“征兵入困境，老弱残兵将上阵”为题，透露蒋记国防部，曾于二月下旬发出一新指示称：“如各县市及龄壮丁不足配额时，得依年次酌予伸延，以达成配额为止。”同日该报载：河北省去年征兵额为三万六千二百七十五人，但至年终仅征得二万六千三百人，约有三分之一数目无法足额。壮丁买卖、顶替、逃跑之风不绝。又平汉战役缴获材料：平市壮丁买卖已成公开，逐街逐户摊派丁款，每户由万元至三十万元不等，每名壮丁价四百万元，但受雇者实得仅百万元左右。蒋第三军给河北第九专署电报中称：该军新兵“多系冒名顶替”，“并言明以五个月为限”。
