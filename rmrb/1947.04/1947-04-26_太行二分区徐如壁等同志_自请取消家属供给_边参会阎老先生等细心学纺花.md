　　【This Newspaper, Taihang News】 In the Taihang Second Military Sub-district's upsurge of production and frugality, many comrades have voluntarily organized their families to engage in production and have canceled public assistance. Xu Rubi, Director of the Health Department, voluntarily requested that the government no longer subsidize his wife, but that she support herself through production, and proposed, "Hand in 10,000 yuan to the public this year through production." The wife of Wang Jilu, Deputy Battalion Commander of the Shouyang Independent Battalion, will also no longer be supported by the government. She will support herself through studying, working and practicing frugality at the school. Yan Qilin, Deputy Political Commissar of the 40th Regiment, voluntarily returned ten mu of land and one courtyard that had been allocated to his wife last year to the masses; Chief of Staff Wu Yizhou returned twenty mu of land and one cave dwelling; Organization Officer Guo Ruzhen also returned twenty mu of land and one house to the masses. The Political Department of the Military Sub-district issued a special circular to commend them. (Feng)
    【This Newspaper News】 Commissioners Yan, Dongfang, and Zhang, all in their sixties, patiently spin cotton, promoting the spinning movement in the Border Council organs. Mr. Yan Shuyuan, a Border Government Commissioner, is already sixty-four years old, with white hair. Seeing the great enthusiasm of young people for spinning, he immediately bought a spinning wheel. After several days of learning, he was able to draw thread. Now he can spin fine and even threads and does not want to waste even an inch of cotton, even piecing together broken bits of fluff. Commissioner Dongfang Ping had previously planted five hundred hemp plants and recently bought a spinning wheel, insisting on spinning cotton despite his back pain. Mr. Zhang Tianlin, a resident commissioner of the Border Council, who is also nearly sixty years old, is particularly interested in spinning thread and can spin three liang of thread every day. Seeing that all the veteran leaders were spinning cotton, all the comrades in the Council also bought spinning wheels one after another. Most of the more than ten workers and miscellaneous staff in the organs have learned how to spin. (Xiushan)

    【本报太行讯】二分区生产节约热潮中，不少同志自动组织家属生产，取消公家帮助。卫生处长徐如壁同志自动要求不要公家供给自己爱人，由生产解决，并提出：“今年生产一万元交公。”寿阳独立营副营长王纪录同志的爱人，今后也不要公家供给，由她自己在学校一面学习、一面工作和生产节约解决。四十团副政委阎起林同志自动把去年分给他爱人的十亩地一座院退还群众；参谋长武义周同志退出廿亩地、窑一孔；组织干事郭如珍同志也退出二十亩地、一座房给群众。分区政治部特通报表扬。（锋）
    【本报讯】六十多岁的阎、东方、张委员，耐心纺花，推动了边参会机关纺织运动。边府委员阎庶苑先生，年已六十四岁，白发苍苍，见年轻人纺织劲头很大，自己当即买车一辆，经数日学习即能抽线，现已能纺的细而匀；并且不愿浪费一寸线的花，断的线毛毛也要续上。东方屏委员屏前已种大麻五百棵，最近又买纺花车，腰痛仍坚持纺花。边参会驻会委员张天林先生，年亦将六旬，纺线特感兴趣，每天可以纺线三两。参议会全体同志看到诸位老首长均纺花，亦纷纷买车，该机关工杂人员十余人，大部已学会。（秀山）
