　　Japanese House of Councillors Holds Elections
    Democratic Parties Win 63 Seats
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, April 26th: Comprehensive reports indicate that the Japanese House of Councillors election was held on the 20th. Although under the support of the American occupation authorities and the manipulation of reactionary zaibatsu political parties, the growth of democratic forces could not be suppressed. In the election of 250 Councillors, the Japanese Communist Party, the Socialist Party, and other democratic parties still won 63 seats, including nine women, which is unprecedented in Japanese history. The majority of voters refused to vote in this election to show their resistance. According to a report in the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun: "The number of voter absences in this House of Councillors election is unprecedentedly large. According to official materials, of the 2,622,369 registered voters in Tokyo, 1,238,736 did not participate in the voting. Nationwide, an average of about 40 percent of voters refused to vote."

　　日本参议院举行选举
    民主党派获六十三席
    【新华社陕北二十六日电】综合报导：日本参议院选举已于二十日举行。虽在美占领当局支持及反动财阀政党操纵包办下，但仍无法遏止民主势力的增长。在二百五十席参议员选举中，日共及社会党等民主党派仍获得六十三席，且其中九名为妇女，此在日本历史上是空前未有的。此次选举大多数选民拒绝投票，以示抵抗。据东京朝日新闻报导：“在此次参议院选举中，选民缺席数目空前巨大。据官方材料，在东京二百六十二万二千三百六十九个已登记的选民中，有一百二十三万八千七百三十六人没参加投票。在全国范围内，平均约为百分之四十的选民拒绝投票。”
