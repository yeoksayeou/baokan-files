Xinhua News Agency, Central China, April 14th: Spring plowing, the first since land reform, is underway on the Northern Jiangsu Plain. The Yanfu District Administration has distributed 1.1 million catties of seeds and agricultural loans in advance. Laborers who had gone elsewhere are returning home to production in response to the call of the democratic government. Poor peasants who have obtained land are repairing farm implements day and night, actively accumulating manure, and organizing mutual aid teams. Ye Ting (of Yancheng) and Wu Ruiqing have added 20 new windmills to their original 200, which are already turning in the wind. In Jiangzhuang, in the same county, 40,000 cubic feet of river have been dredged to eliminate 50 mu of barren land that has been unproductive for decades due to excessive alkaline content. Farmers in Jingkou District, Huai'an, have created a new method of raising water with dams (the river water in this area all comes from the lower reaches of the Grand Canal; raising the water level after damming allows it to be irrigated into the fields), providing water for 2,000 mu of rice seedling fields. Xiaohuzhuang, a model labor village in Funing, originally had 300 mu of land, which has increased to 400 mu after land reform. Currently, all the maize fields in the village have been ploughed twice, and manure has been universally applied to the wheat fields. Labor heroes in various places are engaging in spring plowing competitions, proposing that in addition to mutual aid teams for deep plowing and careful cultivation, guerrilla groups should be organized to both plant rice seedlings and provide armed protection for spring plowing.

　　苏北平原春耕
    秋地耕过两遍
    麦田普遍上粪
    【新华社华中十四日电】苏北平原上，正进行土地改革后第一度春耕。盐阜区两个专署，事先发放种籽农贷一百一十万斤。外出劳力，在民主政府号召下，纷纷归家生产。得田贫农，更日夜修理农具，积极积粪，组织换工。叶挺（盐城）伍瑞卿，除原有两百部风车已随风转动外，又新添二十部。同县蒋庄，为消灭几十年来因碱汁过多不长庄稼的五十亩荒田，开河四万立方尺。淮安泾口区农民，创造打坝上水新办法（该地河水均来自运河下流，打坝后水位增高灌入田内），二千亩秧田得水。阜宁劳动模范村小胡庄，原有田三百亩，土地改革后增至四百亩。现全庄玉蜀黍田已耕过两遍，麦田已普遍上粪。各地劳动英雄互作春耕竞赛，提出除换工队深耕细作外，并组织游击组，一面栽秧，一面武装保卫春耕。
