　　The First Sub-district of Ji-Lu-Yu Experiences a Month and a Half of Movement

　　One Million Farmers Reclaim Land
　　[Report from this newspaper, Ji-Lu-Yu] The First Sub-district of Ji-Lu-Yu, has seen nearly one million farmers gain land. On the first day of last month, the Prefectural Committee convened a joint meeting of county secretaries, summarizing the achievements of a month and a half of land reform: In the past month and a half, the mass movement has been vigorous and magnificent in scale, most of the feudal landlords have been overthrown, and nearly one million farmers have gained land, grain, farm implements, and oxen. The thinking of the cadres has also taken a leap forward; from "no prospects" to "having prospects"; from pitying the landlords to thoroughly eliminating feudal forces; from being timid to boldly mobilizing; from cadres taking over and middle and poor peasants equally dividing the spoils, to letting the masses distribute themselves according to the principle of leveling and replenishing. Changqing implemented the policy of seizing guns in one hand and dividing fields in the other. With the direct participation of the troops, it has been carried out in the villages around Guo She and Dajue Temple, ten miles away from the city. Ningyang cleared out Chiang Kai-shek's special agents and bandits on one hand, and divided the land on the other. The troops participated for half a month, and the masses in one hundred and seventy-five villages were divided into land and floating wealth. The masses in the old areas of Taixi, Feicheng, and Pingyin reorganized and lifted the "lid" (landlords). In the large-scale review in the sixth district of Pingyin, after "north-south comparison", the last feudal fortress, Xiaoliuzhuang, also broke through. The summary pointed out that land reform has not yet been completely completed, and many places still have feudal remnants. In Tuntou and Yangzhuang in the fourth district of Feicheng, the farmers have an average of one and a half acres of land per person, while the landlords still retain three acres of good land and are still secretly ruling the masses. The same situation exists in Anzhuang and Shigou in Taian, and Zhangdian and Dafeng in Feicheng. In some areas, land and floating wealth have not been distributed or the distribution is unfair. In Xihutun, Feicheng, there are still four hundred trees and eighty or ninety houses that have not been distributed. In Yanghuayuan, there are also hundreds of acres of land that have been distributed, but the masses still do not know the boundaries. In addition, many of the leading cadres are of middle-peasant or above. The eight group leaders in Niezhuang, Feicheng, are all middle peasants and rich middle peasants, and they are slow to divide the spoils. Based on the above situation, it was decided to continue to combine the war and carry out a mass-based review movement in the future.

　　冀鲁豫一分区经过月半运动
  　百万农民收回土地
    【本报冀鲁豫讯】冀鲁豫一分区，已有近百万农民获得土地。上月初一日地委召开县书联席会议，总结一个半月土地改革成绩称：一个半月以来，群运声势浩大、规模宏伟，大部封建地主被打垮，近百万农民获得土地、粮食、农具和耕牛。干部思想亦跃进一步；由“没搞头”到“有搞头”；由怜悯地主到彻底消灭封建势力；由小手小脚到放手发动；由干部包办，中贫农同等分果实转变到让群众自己按填平补齐原则分配。长清执行了一手拿枪一手分田方针，在部队直接参加下，一直开展到离城十里的国社、大觉寺一带村庄。宁阳一面清剿蒋特土匪，一面分地，部队参加半月，一百七十五村群众分到土地浮财。老区泰西、肥城、平阴等地群众重整旗鼓，掀掉了“锅盖子”（地主）。平阴六区大复查中，经过“南北对查”，最后一个封建堡垒小刘庄也突开局面了。总结指出：土地改革尚未彻底完成，许多地方还留有封建尾巴，肥城四区屯头、杨庄农民每人平均一亩半地，而地主却仍留有三亩好地，仍在暗中统治群众。泰西安庄、石沟，肥城张店、大封一带，都有同样情形。还有的地区，土地浮财尚未分配或分配不公，肥城西湖屯还有四百棵树和八九十间房子没有分配。杨花园亦有百余亩地分配后，群众尚不知地边。此外，领导干部很多系中农以上成分，肥城聂庄八个组长都是中农和富中农，迟迟不分果实。根据以上情况，决定今后继续结合战争，开展群众性的翻身大检查运动。
