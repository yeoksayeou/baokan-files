Villages along the Shahe River Actively Plant Trees and Afforest
    [Report from this newspaper, Shahe] The villages along the Shahe River have suffered from floods for years, and the fields have become sandy beaches. The demand for large-scale afforestation and tree planting has become a unanimous call from the masses. The Xingtai Agricultural and Forestry Bureau and the Shahe County Government have jointly discussed and specifically arranged the county's afforestation and tree planting work. This year, the county plans to plant 500,000 trees. In addition to ordinary tree planting, villages generally designate the villages along the Shahe River as afforestation base points. More willows are planted closer to the river, and more pear trees, jujube trees, mulberry trees, and other fruit trees are planted further away from the river. The liberated masses in various villages are very enthusiastic about afforestation. The villages of Putongdian, Tiancun, and Yaocun in the Sixth District, and the villages of Xibeiliu and Duanzhuang in the Fifth District, and Xia Zheng in the Third District, have planted a total of more than 28,000 trees. Many trees have also been planted in other villages, which have not yet been counted. In order to strengthen the afforestation work in Shahe, the Xingtai Agricultural and Forestry Bureau has specially organized an afforestation work group to be stationed in the fifth, sixth, and seventh districts along the Shahe River to be responsible for organizing and promoting the work, and to jointly discuss issues such as afforestation inspection, rewards, and forest management with the county government.

    [Report from this newspaper, Pingshun] In Shannan Village, First District, cadres took the lead in planting 130 trees. The next day, cadres led the masses, and teachers led the children, and planted the river beach and roadside full in one day. The masses originally suggested that there were no seedlings and no place to plant them. After the cadres understood the masses' thoughts, they personally helped the masses coordinate the seedlings and suggested that whoever planted them would own them. Everyone was very energetic, working from dawn till dusk. At present, a total of more than 330 trees have been planted, and there are plans to plant another 200 trees, and a nursery of 0.5 mu is also being prepared.

    【本报平顺讯】一区山南村，干部首先带头栽树一百三十棵，第二天，干部领导群众，教员领导儿童，一天把河滩大路边都栽了个满满的。群众原先提出没有栽子，也没地方栽，干部了解群众思想后，自己亲自动手与群众调剂上栽子，并提出谁栽上是谁的，大家劲头很大，起早搭黑，现已合计栽树三百三十余棵，计划再栽二百棵，并准备开苗圃五分。
