    Recognizing that Fighting Chiang Kai-shek is for Oneself
    5,000 Farmers in Yongnian Enlist
    [Special Dispatch from this Newspaper] "To protect Chairman Mao, to protect our land, what should we do?" After in-depth discussions in various villages of Yongnian, the liberated farmers of the entire county reached this conclusion: "Defeating Chiang Kai-shek is the only way to achieve peace. To defeat Chiang Kai-shek, we must join the army and go to the front lines." They deeply understood that joining the army to fight Chiang Kai-shek was their own affair. Within ten days, 4,839 people signed up to join the army, exceeding the original recruitment target by three times, creating a mass upsurge of enlistment. In this upsurge, many models of enlistment emerged. In the Fifth District alone, 2,000 people signed up to join the army. Wang Fuyou, the village chief of Dongxinzhai Village, led 50 people to enlist. Song Taimeng, the chairman of the Liu Han Farmers' Association, sent his son to join the army, saying, "Fighting Chiang Kai-shek is everyone's business, we must join the army!" The cadres of Gao Yao Village led the masses to achieve liberation in the past, and now all the village cadres are taking the lead in joining the army. At a meeting in Gucheng Village, 50 people automatically signed up to join the army. Village cadres from Liu Village and Dabeiwang Village, due to their age, sent their own children to the front lines. In Liuhan Village, 110 people enlisted in the army. A member of the Women's Association in Shibeiwang sent her husband, Han Tianbao, to join the army, telling him before he left, "Don't think about me while you're out there, come back after defeating Chiang Kai-shek." In Liu Bei and Liu Han Villages, the entire village celebrated when the new soldiers left to join the army. Parents repeatedly instructed their children, saying, "If you don't drive away Chiang Kai-shek, if you don't defeat the iron devil (traitors in Yongnian City), don't come back. If you come back, we won't let you in the door." In Liuwan Village, He Chunbao worked as a farmhand for more than ten years in the past, but now he has been liberated. This time, both he and his brother joined the army. Dong Yaozhang and Wang Luo also automatically signed up to join the army with their sharecroppers. In the Fourth District, 1,700 young adults enlisted. In the Third District, 519 people enlisted, and in the Sixth District, 500 young adults joined the army. The Second District is closest to the enemy in the city, and 120 young adults also automatically enlisted. At the enlistment meeting, after taking the oath, the young adults who enlisted shouted in unison, "Overthrow Chiang Kai-shek and enjoy peace! We won't go home until we overthrow Chiang Kai-shek!"
