　　To Eliminate Feudalism, One Must Be Resolute
    Peasants Urge the Poor to Thoroughly Liquidate Landlords

    Influenced by the struggles of peasants in the countryside, poor members of the urban areas have also become invigorated, believing that peasants are more resolute than they are in dealing with feudalism. They actively cooperate with peasants in squeezing out concealed property. The Poor People's Association led landlords through the streets, calling on citizens to voice their grievances and demand documents. In the Fifth Street, more than two qing of black land were squeezed out by rural peasants. The Poor People's Association reported more than one qing of concealed land. One poor member even reported that he had been cultivating thirteen mu of grainless land belonging to a traitorous landlord. In the Eleventh Street, during the class demarcation process, a small landlord (shop assistant) hiding within the Poor People's Association was exposed. He had been renting more than 90 mu of land in the countryside without settling accounts. A total of 619 documents were found among the 243 landlords in each street, along with 1,116 mu of black land and un-exchanged water land, 11,896 mu of dry land, eight taels and nine qian of gold, and a large quantity of clothing and grain. A mediation approach was adopted for 96 small landlords and renting peddlers, merchants, and military dependents.

    In the handling of the fruits of victory, unprecedented unity was demonstrated between urban and rural masses. Poor members from each street expressed that the peasants in the countryside had suffered greater pain and should receive a larger share. The peasants in the countryside said that without the help of the poor in the urban areas, they would not be able to thoroughly eradicate the roots of feudalism, and that they should share the food and benefits together. In a harmonious atmosphere, a 50/50 or 30/70 split was adopted to resolve the issues smoothly. The Urban Poor People's Association also transferred a large number of land documents obtained through struggle to tenants in the countryside. More than a thousand peasants in the countryside received back a large number of red contract documents, celebrating the return of land to its rightful owners. (Bing Ru, Xue Guang, Lu Lin)

　　消灭封建心要硬
    农民推动贫民彻底清算地主
    城关贫民会员在四乡农民斗争影响下也振奋起来，认为农民对封建比咱心硬，积极配合农民挤隐蔽财产。贫民会带着各街地主游行，号召市民诉苦、要文书。五街由乡下农民挤出二顷多黑地，由贫民会报出一顷多黑瞒地，一个贫民会员自报出分种汉奸地主十三亩没粮地。十一街从划阶级中，挤出隐藏在贫民会内小地主（店员），在乡共租种九十多亩土地未清算，各街二百四十三个地主，共查出文约六一九张，查出黑地和未换约水地一一一六亩，旱地一一八九六亩，黄金八两九钱，一及大批衣服粮食。对九十六个小地主及出租的小贩、商人、军属，采取了调解办法。
    在处理果实上城乡群众表现了前所未有的团结。各街贫民会员都表示：乡下农民受的痛苦大，应该多分，四乡农民说：没城关贫民帮助，咱也刨不透封建老根，应该有饭同吃，有利同得。相互间在和谐空气中，采取对半批、三七批方式，顺利得到解决。城关贫民会还把斗出的大批土地文约，转送四乡佃户，四乡千余农民领回大批红契文约，纷纷庆贺土地还家。（冰如、薛光、鲁林）
