Xinhua News Agency, Jinji-Lu-Yu, April 25th: The militia behind enemy lines in Hebei, Shandong, and Henan have shifted from attacking "Home Returning Legions" to actively attacking Chiang Kai-shek's regular troops. On the 7th, 300 Chiang troops, accompanied by a vehicle, were traveling on the Dingtao-Cao County highway. Six militiamen from the Fourth District of Qibin allowed the enemy infantry to pass, then ambushed the enemy vehicle, killing and capturing five Chiang soldiers, and seizing more than 800 jin of gasoline. On the 6th, a platoon of a certain unit of Chiang’s regular army stationed in Luhutong, Shou Zhang, along with a unit of the “Home Returning Legion,” carrying machine guns and grenade launchers, went to Gaochalou to loot grain. A squad of militiamen from the Sixth District of Shou Zhang ambushed them on their return trip, wounding three and capturing Chiang’s secret agent Yu Qijing alive, seizing some ammunition. At dawn on the 9th, the enemy gathered two companies of the 37th Regiment of the 72nd Division and a unit of the "Home Returning Legion," totaling more than 200 men, carrying a large number of automatic weapons, and surrounded the militia squad at Chenjiaji. The militia cleverly withdrew, luring the enemy to the vicinity of Dazhutan, and ambushed the enemy from the front and rear with a unit of the Yunbei militia, wounding 13 enemy soldiers and killing an enemy company commander, recovering all the looted grain and clothing and returning it to the masses.
