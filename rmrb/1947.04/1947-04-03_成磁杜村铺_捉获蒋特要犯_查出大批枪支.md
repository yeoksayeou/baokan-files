　　Chengci Ducunpu

    Arrest of Key Chiang Kai-shek Special Agent
    Discovery of Large Quantity of Firearms
    [Our Newspaper, Chengci Dispatch] On the 12th of last month, the 5th District, Ducunpu, cracked a secret agent organization. This case was solved by Zhao Yushu, a veteran of honor from this village, after three months of diligent investigation. He first found the documents of the secret agent organization. After fully understanding the situation, he reported it to the local people's armed forces, who surrounded the village on the evening of the 12th and captured the main secret agent personnel, including a deputy adjutant of the secret agent organization's regiment headquarters, two intelligence officers, and five squad and platoon leaders and below. (The secret agent battalion commander, Yang Fulin, escaped and is currently being pursued.) In addition, over 30 firearms were discovered, including Mauser pistols, Browning pistols, rifles, and one light machine gun, along with over 200 rounds of ammunition, all of which were temporarily borrowed by the local militia. The secret agent criminals have now been handed over to the government and are under interrogation. Since the arrest of the secret agents, the masses have raised many opinions to them, and the masses have finally turned over. An old woman named Zou from this village said, "I will never forget that Chairman Mao led us to turn over." (Xiong Chelin, Liu Baoquan, Chen Jixiang)
