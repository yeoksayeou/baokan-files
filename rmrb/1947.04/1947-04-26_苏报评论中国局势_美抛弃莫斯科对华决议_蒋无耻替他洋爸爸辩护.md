Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, April 21st: TASS, April 17th: Kinoev recently published a commentary in Izvestia entitled "Who Is Interfering in China's Internal Affairs?" The author, in reviewing the decisions made at the Moscow Three-Power Representatives Conference in December 1945, pointed out that since then, China's political and economic situation has greatly deteriorated, which inevitably hinders the establishment of normal political and economic relations internationally. Therefore, it is entirely appropriate to examine the implementation of the Moscow Conference decisions. The Kuomintang reactionary newspapers fiercely attacked the Soviet Union's proposal to exchange information on this issue, slandering it as an attempt to interfere in China's internal affairs, undermine the sovereignty of the Chinese government, and wantonly provoke the Soviet Union, and used this to desperately defend the United States' open and systematic interference in China's internal affairs, attempting to make people believe that the United States' interference "helps" to stabilize the domestic political and economic situation. For this reason, they often mention the United States' financial and material "aid" to China. However, a little analysis of this kind of assistance will reveal that it is extremely one-sided and almost purely military assistance, which does not help to improve China's political and economic situation in the slightest. Under the guise of "aid," the United States is taking total control of the Kuomintang armed forces and is striving to control China. In conclusion, Mr. 奥 [Ao] stated: "The United States supports the Kuomintang reactionaries, supports military aid which is clearly proactive in nature, and thereby fuels the Chinese civil war, causing the Chinese economy to be destroyed by war and the corruption of the reactionary Kuomintang authorities."

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, April 24th: TASS reported: Observer Marinin recently commented on the Chinese situation in Pravda, pointing out that the Kuomintang's policies have plunged China into a very serious crisis. The Chinese civil war has never been as fierce or on such a large scale as it is today. The discrimination against Chinese democrats has also never been as severe as it is today. Marinin continued: "If the Kuomintang reactionaries were still able to implement their plan to expand the civil war after the announcement of the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers' Agreement, then there is no doubt that they were encouraged and promoted by the United States. The United States has adopted the main principle of its China policy of supporting the Chinese reactionary forces against the progressive democratic forces. It is estimated that after Japan's surrender, the United States' aid to the Kuomintang troops has reached a very large scale. This aid is basically manifested in the United States training and equipping 26 Kuomintang armies. Twenty-two of these armies, totaling 700,000 men, were all trained and equipped by the United States. In addition, the United States trained and equipped 50,000 strong armed police for the Kuomintang. Americans also established 30 military schools in China to train air force personnel, military staff, spies, and infantry, artillery, and other commanding cadres. To this day, the United States still maintains a large number of American troops in China to continue providing massive and multifaceted assistance to the Kuomintang in fighting the Chinese People's Liberation Army. Therefore, it must be said that the important resolutions of the Moscow Conference on non-interference in China's internal affairs and the withdrawal of foreign troops stationed in China have not been fulfilled by the United States. We can express the Kuomintang's policy in two related sentences: on the one hand, it is willing to accept American interference in any situation and in any form in order to consolidate its military and economic position; on the other hand, it is to suppress China's democratic forces. This policy causes China to become increasingly subordinate to foreign capital, infringes on China's sovereignty, and causes the war against China's democratic forces to develop on an unprecedented scale."

    美抛弃莫斯科对华决议         
    蒋无耻替他洋爸爸辩护
    【新华社陕北二十一日电】塔斯社十七日讯：基诺奥夫顷以《是谁正在干涉中国内政》为题于消息报发表评论。作者于回顾一九四五年十二月莫斯科三强代表会议所作决定时，指出自此以后中国的政治经济情况即大大地恶化，这不可避免的阻碍了国际间正常政治与经济关系的建立。因此，检查莫斯科会议决定的履行是十分适宜的。国民党反动报纸猛烈地攻击苏联所提就此问题交换情报的建议，侮蔑其为意图干涉中国内政、损害中国政府的主权、借此恣意的向苏联挑衅，并借此竭力替美国公开与系统的干涉中国内政辩护，妄图使人相信美国的干涉“有助”于国内政治经济情况的安定。为此，他们常常提及美国对中国财政与物资的“援助”。但此种援助，只要稍加分析，即可看出乃极端单方面的及几乎纯系军事的援助，丝毫无助于中国政治经济情况的改进。而在“援助”的假面具下，美国正在全部控制着国民党武装部队，并努力掌握中国。奥氏在结论中表示：“美国支持国民党反动派，支持显然属于主动的军事援助性质，并因而助长了中国内战，使中国经济毁灭于战事与反动的国民党当局之腐败中。”
    【新华社陕北廿四日电】塔斯社讯：观察家马里宁顷在真理报上评论中国局势，指出：国民党的政策已使中国陷入非常严重的危机中。中国内战从来没有像今日这样的剧烈与规模这样的大。中国民主分子的遭受歧视，也从未像今日这样厉害。马里宁继称：“假若国民党反动派在莫斯科三外长协定公布后，仍能实行其扩大内战的计划，那毫无疑问，他们是受了美国的鼓励与推动。美国已采取支持中国反动势力反对进步的民主势力为其对华政策的主要方针。据估计日本投降后，美国对国民党部队的援助已达非常大的范围。这种援助，基本上表现于美国为国民党训练并装备二十六个军。其中二十二个军，计七十万人，全系美国训练与装备起来的。此外，美国又为国民党训练并装备了五万强有力的武装警察。美国人还在中国办了三十座军事学校，以训练空军人员、军事参谋、间谍、及步兵、炮兵及其他的指挥干部。直到今天，美国仍在中国保持着很多的美国军队，以继续大量地多方面地援助国民党向中国人民解放军作战。所以，必须这样说，莫斯科会议关于不干涉中国内政和撤退在华外国驻军的重要决议，并未为美国履行。我们可以从两句相关联的话来表明国民党的政策，一方面是甘心接受美国在任何情况下任何形式的干涉，以巩固其军事的与经济的地位；另一方面则是镇压中国的民主力量。这种政策使中国每况愈下的隶属于外国资本，使中国主权遭受侵犯，使对付中国民主力量的战争发展到前所未有的规模。
