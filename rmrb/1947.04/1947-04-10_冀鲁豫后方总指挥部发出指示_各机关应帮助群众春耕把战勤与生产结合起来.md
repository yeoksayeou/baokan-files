　　Instructions Issued by the Rear Headquarters of the Jin-Lu-Yu Military Region
  　All Agencies Should Help the Masses with Spring Plowing, Combining War Support with Production
    [This newspaper, Jin-Lu-Yu, 8th] The Rear Headquarters of the Jin-Lu-Yu Military Region has recently issued instructions on combining war support with production, pointing out that spring plowing is approaching, and the Self-Defense War is becoming increasingly intense. Both war support and spring plowing must be done well, and some counties must also combine land reform and the conscription movement. For this reason, the following two points should be noted: (1) Leading cadres of agencies should personally get involved, going village by village to specifically help solve the difficulties of the masses. Agency livestock should be organized to help military families and poor masses with spring plowing, and all personnel should be organized to pull plows and dig the ground. Vice Minister Li of the Military Region Health Department led personnel from the hospital and institutes to help the masses plant 135 mu of wheat in Bianzhuang, Yuncheng last year, which is worth learning from. (2) Widely organize mutual aid groups, implement unified leadership for participation in the war and production, and unify stretcher teams, cart teams, and production mutual aid groups, assigning tasks according to production mutual aid groups.
    [This newspaper, Southern Hebei, 6th] The Political Department of the Southern Hebei Military Region recently issued instructions on troops participating in spring plowing production, stating that: The participation of troops in spring plowing production should focus on helping the masses with production, supplemented by self-production. In terms of time, it should be people first, then the military. The main content of helping the masses with spring plowing production lies in the organized assistance in adjusting production tools, livestock, or manpower; in saving manpower and material resources and avoiding unnecessary labor service; in armed protection of the masses to implement rushing to plow and plant; in assisting local mobilization and organization, as well as rectifying discipline and improving military-civilian relations. Local armed forces in each military sub-district should protect the masses' plowing and planting while adhering to border struggles. All rear agencies, except military schools, arsenals, clothing factories, and hospitals, should properly organize manpower and livestock to help the masses in their stationed areas carry out activities such as plowing, transporting manure, and sowing seeds. All agencies and troops should conscientiously save civilian labor. Except for stretcher transportation needed by front-line combat troops, all other forms of labor service are prohibited during the spring plowing period.

　　冀鲁豫后方总指挥部发出指示
  　各机关应帮助群众春耕把战勤与生产结合起来
    【本报冀鲁豫八日电】冀鲁豫后方总指挥部顷发出关于战勤结合生产的指示，指出：目前春耕将届，又正值自卫战争日益紧张，战勤与春耕均须保证搞好，有的县并须结合土地改革、参军运动进行。为此需注意以下两点：（一）机关领导干部亲自下手，走一村作一村，以具体帮助解决群众困难。机关牲口组织起来帮助军属和贫苦群众春耕，并组织所有人员拉犁掘地。军区卫生部李副部长去年在郓城边庄带领院、所人员帮助群众种麦一百三十五亩，值得大家学习。（二）广泛组织互助组，实行参战、生产统一领导，将担架组、大车组、生产互助组统一起来，按生产互助组派差。
    【本报冀南六日电】冀南军区政治部于日前发出关于部队参加春耕生产的指示，内称：部队参加春耕生产，应以帮助群众生产为主，自己生产为辅。在时间上应先民后军。帮助群众春耕生产的主要内容，在于有组织的帮助调剂生产工具、畜力或人力；在于节省人力物力，避免不必要的支差；在于武装掩护群众，实行抢耕抢种；在于协助地方动员与组织，以及整顿纪律，改善军民关系。各分区地方武装，在坚持边缘斗争时，应掩护群众耕种。一切后方机关，除军事学校、兵工厂、被服厂、医院以外，皆应妥善的组织人力畜力，帮助驻地群众进行耕地运粪下种等。所有机关部队，应切实做到节省民力，除前线作战部队需用之担架运输外，其他一律在春耕期间不许支差。
