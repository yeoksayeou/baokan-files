　　Self-Awareness and Solidarity: Left-right Rectifies Relationships, Mobilizes the Backward, and Squeezes Out Feudal Experiences
　　[This report from Left-right, Shanxi Province] The Left-right County's promotion of self-aware solidarity movements has yielded the following experiences:

　　Guiding Recognition of Shortcomings from Cadre Boasting
　　After the county and district convened a village cadre meeting, which discovered and resolved the roughly complacent thinking of village cadres, each village first conducted further specific checks to more clearly define the cadres' thinking on mobilizing the backward and squeezing out feudalism. For example, Wen City in the Third District began inspections, but everyone had some difficulty getting started. After cadres were asked to boast about their accomplishments, they were guided to conduct specific checks. It was discovered that thirteen farmers in the village had kept things for landlords and passed on messages (mostly relatives and hired workers); thirty farmers were afraid that cadres would only make them attend meetings; and twenty-seven farmers had not risen up at all, especially in mountain villages and among women, with more than forty women not rising up. In the Fourth District, Jianmiao, because cadres monopolized the distribution of fruit, they distributed fruit to whoever went to them. Only thirty-one households received fruit, while more than seventy households missed out. As a result, village cadres became more clearly aware that the movement was not thorough enough.

　　After discovering so many "backward" masses, specific discussions and studies were clearly launched among the village cadres to explore the reasons why these people lagged behind. At this point, it was also necessary to combine mass discussions to consider whether the landlords had lowered their heads and whether there were problems in the movement. The aim was to guide everyone to speak freely. Because the masses generally adopted a tentative approach to speaking, the leadership should seize the opportunity to dispel the masses' concerns in order to elicit problems and then compare the results of discussions with the village cadres to thoroughly understand the situation and identify problems. After discussions between cadres and the masses in Yangjiao, Fifth District, it was discovered that after the movement had mobilized six-tenths of the masses, this number dropped to four-tenths after the distribution of fruit. One activist (member of the farmers' association) was expelled from the association for saying something unfair. It was impossible not to be "backward." After inspection, it was found that both cadres and the masses in Tupeng, Fifth District, had ideas about a change of regime. The sister-in-law of landlord Wang Hanshan said to the village cadres: "Your leadership has done a good job in helping people to turn over, but we'll see what happens when our people return from outside (in the Jiang army)." As a result, everyone was afraid of being held accountable in the future, so they dared not move at meetings, and the representatives sent by the village cadres also dared not move. These situations, after further discussion among the cadres, made them more clearly aware of the importance of mobilizing the backward, rectifying relationships, and squeezing out feudalism.

　　Understanding before Rectifying Relationships:
　　Do the cadres have any opinions about the leadership? Are there any grudges between the cadres?
　　In rectifying the relationship between cadres and the masses and guiding discussions between them, it is necessary to understand whether the village cadres have any opinions about the leadership and whether there are any grudges between the cadres. The leadership should be good at understanding the situation from the discussions between the cadres and the masses, identifying the problems, and then proceeding from shallow to deep, from dark to bright, from twisting to smooth, to achieve unity among the cadres themselves and with the leadership camp. Otherwise, it will become a movement to struggle against cadres. For example, in the solidarity movement in Wen City, it was initially understood that the former director of the armed committee had been struggled against by the masses in the past due to self-examination, and he was dissatisfied with the leadership. There were also grudges between the cadres. As soon as a meeting was held, it turned into a struggle against the cadres. After careful study by the leadership, it was discovered that the reason why the masses were so harsh on the cadres was that some cadres were active among the masses, trying to use the power of the masses to seek revenge. After the cadres made self-criticisms, some said, "Our cadres are divided into two factions, how can the masses be of one mind?" The current director of the armed committee suggested that the previous struggle was wrong, and the district cadres also took the initiative to make self-criticisms. The former director of the armed committee said, "As long as things are clarified, I also have shortcomings. Distributing too much fruit and taking fruit is not a good style of work, and I should be struggled against." After things were cleared up, everyone said, "We should be honest about our mistakes and twist ourselves into one rope with the masses." The cadres of Yangjiao Village in the Fifth District were not very happy about the ideological struggle at the district meeting. The political director always believed that there was no problem with the Yangjiao cadres. As soon as the district and county cadres arrived in the village, they had the illusion that they were here specifically to rectify them. The leadership immediately explained sincerely that they were here to help Yangjiao mobilize the "backward," and that even if the cadres had flaws, they could be erased. In the cadres' initial discussion, they began by praising everyone's advantages and gradually guided the discussion of shortcomings. Each problem was studied and discussed by everyone and resolved by themselves. The leadership paid attention to taking care of their prestige and self-esteem, and promptly studied, discovered, and resolved their concerns. Only then did they begin to delve into the discussion of the fruit issue, comparing whether they were more special than the masses. One comrade reflected on stealing fruit and not sleeping for half the night, and it took him two days to say it. When this was mentioned, the political director, Wang Huizhong, realized the truth and said that he had shielded the landlord's son after getting married and was unwilling to let the masses struggle against him. The revolution was for anti-imperialism and anti-feudalism, but today he was protecting the landlord's son. The mistake should be handed over to the masses to solve, and the extra fruit should be returned to the masses.

　　The More Thorough the Cadres' Awakening, The Higher the Masses' Awareness
　　After the cadres cleared their minds, they went to the masses to make thorough self-criticisms. As long as the cadres were determined to take the initiative to make self-criticisms, and after inspiring the masses to vent their grievances boldly, the masses themselves would come back to examine themselves. After solving practical problems, the "backward" would also become active. The village head of Dong'an Village in the Fourth District was usually vindictive, and the masses did not dare to express their opinions. After he took the initiative to thoroughly criticize his mistakes, especially his vindictiveness, he said, "I will definitely serve the masses well in the future. If you don't believe me, I will give you a written guarantee." He said "give you a written guarantee" twice in a row, which cleared everyone's minds. Farmer Zhao Shanglin jumped up and said, "I usually don't get along with him, but when I heard that he was going to give a written guarantee, I was moved." Qi Liu said, "Others may not, but when I heard the village head say that he would give us a written guarantee to serve us, I listened!" Wang Shoucai said, "Cadres make mistakes, but they also have advantages. He doesn't work in the dark, he can't cut firewood during the day, why is that!" Without much effort, the problem was solved, and everyone laughed. Song Jinshan, the village instructor in Wen Village, returned 2,000 yuan for buying fruit cheaply after self-criticism, and other village cadres returned houses and made self-criticisms. The cadres felt happy and overcame the idea of losing face. Some of the masses made comments on the bad elements: "Village cadres are wrong, but we can't 'everyone pushes the wall that is about to fall, everyone hits the drum that is broken.' We can't blindly accuse the cadres. We are also wrong."

　　Experience in Squeezing Out Feudalism
　　After rectifying the relationship between cadres and the masses, the farmers' awareness was greatly improved, and they gradually delved into solving the ideas of superstition, fate, change of regime, and the middle peasants' fear of cutting the leeks, and moved towards great unity. They consciously separated themselves from the landlords ideologically, causing the landlords to be squeezed out everywhere. There are the following points of experience in squeezing out feudalism:

　　(1) Mobilizing the "backward" must guide them to be conscious. Wang Bingyuan, a "backward" farmer in Huangzhang, did not become conscious and did not say that he had kept things for the landlord. Someone brought it up at the conference, and the landlord threatened him secretly after the meeting. Bingyuan jumped off a cliff and died. This led to a large discussion among the masses, who recognized the landlord's viciousness. The masses shouted anxiously, "If the landlords are not clarified, they will harm people everywhere." The masses checked the three landlord women and found twenty-seven pieces of silk and satin clothing, and 17,000 yuan in Ji banknotes from one landlord woman. The masses said more anxiously, "Don't be afraid of the landlords' many tricks, as long as everyone keeps their eyes open," "You hide everything, and we won't let you go until you pay your blood debt." The masses recognized the landlords' conspiracy from the bloody lesson.

　　(2) Constantly inspire the peasants to be more conscious, and feudalism will definitely be squeezed out. In the process of mobilizing the "backward" to squeeze out feudalism in Huangzhang, the leadership promptly put forward the slogan "Turn yourself over and make great contributions to the turned-over peasants," which cleared Liu Wuba's mind. He secretly buried silver dollars for the landlord and dared not say it, fearing that others would call him a running dog. This glorious slogan of making contributions inspired him to dispel his worries. He first said one place to test, and after digging out 200 yuan, everyone praised him for being glorious and contributing. The district cadres also praised him, and then used the method of praising his achievements to inspire his consciousness. He reported three times in a row, digging out a total of 899 yuan in silver dollars. This inspired most of the peasants, and everyone shouted in unison, "If we are not conscious, the landlords will not be poor," "If we are backward, the landlords will not bow their heads," "If we quarrel, the landlords will be happier." From here, it can be seen that mobilizing backward farmers is not something that can be done all at once, nor can it be mobilized by one method. It is necessary to gradually inspire them in every fact and every stage, from inspiration to inspiration, so that the "backward" and the vast number of peasants become more and more conscious and move towards greater unity.

　　(3) On the basis of the masses' conscious awareness, in the actual actions of solving each specific problem and squeezing out feudalism, the peasants will naturally inspire each other and expand unity. The leaders should consciously guide everyone to break through the idea of ​​parochialism, expand from the village to the mountain village, and from the minority to all the peasants, so that they can be mobilized, consciously, and united without leaving a single household. The middle peasants' idea of ​​cutting leeks can also be solved on the basis of the gradual mobilization of the peasants and the gradual exposure of the landlords' cunning conspiracies. From the movement, the peasants gradually clarified the class boundaries. The principle for themselves is "It's your own family if you stink, and you can solve the problem if something happens." The principle for the landlords is "Even if a close relative dies, they are outsiders, and you must distinguish between near and far." This clarified the principles of right and wrong and applied them to every specific problem handled in the movement, and the middle peasants' fears were naturally resolved in practice.

　　自觉再自觉团结更团结
  　左权整关系发动落后挤封建经验
    【本报左权讯】左权开展自觉团结运动，获得如下经验：
　  从干部表功中引导认识缺点
    全县经区召开村干会，发现与解决了村干部的差不多自满思想后，各村首先作进一步的具体检查，以便更加明确干部发动落后挤封建的思想。如三区温城开始检查，大家有些钻不进去，经过由干部表功，引导具体检查，查出全村有十三个农民给地主保存东西、通消息（大部是亲戚雇工）；有三十个农民怕干部只跟着开会；有二十七个农民根本没起来；特别是山庄与妇女占多数，妇女有四十多个没起来。四区尖庙因分果实时干部包办，谁去给谁分果实；分得果实者只有三十一户，丢掉的就有七十多户，这样一来，村干部更清醒的感到运动的不深入。
    经查出这样多的“落后”群众后，便明确的在村干部中展开具体讨论与研究，这些人为什么落了后？使他们去找出原因，这时还要结合群众酝酿，地主是否低了头，运动中是否有问题？引导大家乱扯。因群众一般采取试探发言，领导上应抓紧解除群众顾虑，以便引出问题，并与村干部讨论结果，作相互对照，这样易彻底了解情况，发现问题。五区羊角经干群讨论后，发现经过运动发动群众十分之六，经分果实后，变为十分之四，有个积极分子（农会员）说了个不公，被开除出农会，不“落后”也得“落后”。五区土棚经检查发现干群均有变天思想，地主王汉山弟媳对村干部说：“你们领导翻身有功，等俺家在外人回来（在蒋军）再说。”这样大家怕将来算账，开会不敢动，村干部派的代表也不敢动。这些情况再经过干部讨论，才更加明确了发动落后整关系挤封建的重要。
    整关系前要了解：
    干部对领导有无意见？干部之间是否有圪＠？
    在整顿干群关系，引导干群讨论中，要了解村干部对领导上是否有意见，村干部之间是否有疙瘩。领导上要善于从干群酝酿中摸清情况，找出问题所在，而后由浅到深，由暗到明，由扭到通，求得干部本身的团结及与领导阵营的一致，否则就会形成斗干部运动。如温城在进行团结运动中，开始有了解旧武委会主任，过去因反省被群众斗了，对领导不满，干部互相间也有疙瘩，一开会又形成斗干部；经领导上仔细的研究，才发现群众对干部硬的原因，原来是有干部在群众中活动，干部借群众力量企图报复。经干部反省检讨：有的说咱们干部就是两股劲，群众还能一股劲？现任武委会主任提出上次斗得不对，区干部也主动作了检讨。旧武委会主任说：“事情只要闹清，我也有不对，多分果实、拿果实，作风不好，应斗。”经闹通后，大家说咱们有错要坦白，和群众扭成一股劲。五区羊角村干部在区开会思想就闹的不大通，政治主任始终认为羊角干部没问题。区县干部一到村，他们产生错觉，说这是专门来整他们，领导上立即诚恳解释：是来帮助羊角发动“落后”，干部有黑也可以擦。在干部开始讨论中，先由表扬大家优点说起，逐渐引导讨论缺点，每一问题经大家研究讨论，自己解决。领导上注意照顾他们的威信与自尊心，及时研究、发现与解决他们的顾虑，这样才开始钻进讨论果实问题，以比的办法比比是否比群众有些特殊？一个同志反省出因偷果实，半夜没有睡觉的事，他思想上斗了两天才说出。这一提，政治主任王惠忠思想闹通了，谈出：自己结了婚包庇地主儿子，不愿让群众斗，革命为了反帝反封建，今天反又包庇地主儿子，错误应交群众解决，多分的果实也还给群众。
  　干部觉悟越彻底  群众觉悟越提高
    经干部互相间闹通思想后，到群众中作彻底反省。只要干部决心主动检讨，在启发群众大胆发完牢骚后，群众自己也会返回来检查自己，再经解决实际问题，“落后”也会变为积极。四区东庵村长平素好报复，群众不敢提意见，经他主动彻底反省了自己的错，特别是好报复后，并说：“我今后一定给群众好好服务，如大家不信，我给大家打凭据。”一连说了两句打凭据，打通了大家思想。农民赵商林跳起来说：“我平素和他不对，听说立凭据，把我打通了。”七六说：“别人不别人，我听了村长说立凭据给咱们服务，我是入了耳啦！”王守才说：“干部有错，也还有好处，黑明白日误工，人家能割柴他不能，是为甚哩！”没费多大劲，就解决了问题，全场都笑起来。温村村指导员宋金山反省后，退出贱买果实洋二千元，其他村干部有的退房，都作了反省，干部觉的愉快，克服了丢人思想。有的群众针对坏分子提出意见：“村干部不对是有，但咱们不能‘墙倒众人推，鼓破乱人锤。’给干部瞎按，咱们不对也多哩。”
    挤封建经验
    经过整干群关系，农民觉悟大大提高，逐渐深入到解决迷信、命运、变天与中农怕割韭菜等思想，而走向大团结。自觉起来与地主在思想上分了家，使地主到处挨挤。在挤封建中有以下几点经验：
    （一）发动“落后”一定要引导他自觉。黄漳“落后”农民王丙元因没有自觉起来，给地主保存东西没说，大会上有人提出来，会后地主暗威胁，丙元跳崖死了，这一来展开群众大讨论，认清了地主的毒辣，急的群众喊出：“地主不澄清，处处要害人。”全场群众就向地主身上检查，在三个地主妇女身上搜出绸缎衣服二十七件，又从一个地主妇女身上搜出冀钞一万七千元。群众更急的说：“不怕地主鬼计多，只要大家眼睁明，”“你把东西都藏起，不还血债不依你。”群众从血的教训里才认识了地主阴谋。
    （二）随时启发农民再自觉，封建一定会挤垮，农民逐渐觉悟中，领导者应随时注意提出一定的口号启发与提高农民自觉。黄漳发动“落后”挤封建中，领导上及时提出：“自己要翻身，并为翻身农民立大功”的口号，打通了刘五八思想，他给地主暗埋银元，不敢说出，怕别人叫他走狗，这一个立功光荣的口号，启发他解除了顾虑。先说出一处来试探，刨出二百元后，大家表扬了他光荣有功，区干部也夸奖，接着又用表功办法启发觉悟，他一连报出三次，共刨出大洋八百九十九元。这样启发了大部农民，大家齐声喊出：“咱们不自觉，地主不会穷”、“咱们落了后，地主不低头”、“咱们闹意见，地主更心愿”的口号。从这里更看出发动落后农民不是一下子的事，更不是一个办法可以发动起来的，必须在每件事实与每个阶段中去逐渐启发，由启发再启发，而使“落后”与广大农民自觉再自觉，走向团结更团结。
    （三）在群众自觉再自觉的基础上，在解决每个具体问题与挤封建的实际行动中，农民会自然形成相互启发，扩大团结。领导者应有意识的去引导大家突破本位思想，由村扩大到山庄，由少数扩大到全体农民，这样就会不留一户一个的发动起来，自觉起来，团结起来。中农割韭菜思想亦可在农民逐次发动，地主狡猾阴谋逐次暴露的基础上求得解决。从运动中，农民逐渐分明了阶级界限，对自己的原则是“臭死是自家，有事解疙瘩”，对地主的原则是“亲死是旁人，远近要分清。”这样明确了是非原则，贯串到运动中所处理的每一件具体问题上去，中农的恐惧心理就自然在实际中得到解决。（联合办公室）
