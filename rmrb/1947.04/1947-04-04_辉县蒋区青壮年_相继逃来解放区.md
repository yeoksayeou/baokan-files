　　Young and Middle-aged Men in the Jiang Area of Huixian County
    Flee to the Liberated Area One After Another
    [Our newspaper, Taihang, 28th dispatch] The patriotic Bao Ding work in Huixian County's Jiang area has achieved great success. The Liu Fengfang and Guo Zhenjiang families, totaling fourteen people, who fled from the KMT-controlled area to our liberated area last month, were very excited after being received and assisted by our democratic government. They voluntarily went back to publicize the people-loving policies of our democratic government and expose the enemy's deceptive propaganda. As a result, twenty-eight young and middle-aged men came to the liberated area one after another. The democratic government immediately allocated relief grain of 400 catties of millet per person and lent 52 bushels of corn as production funds. They deeply felt that the democratic government was as close as their parents and demanded to arm themselves and fight against Jiang's puppets. In addition to some people organizing mutual aid in production, some people formed guerrilla groups, traveling dozens of miles every night, passing through the enemy's blockhouses and strongholds, and liberating young and middle-aged men. In less than a month, they brought back more than eighty young and middle-aged men.
    [Our newspaper, Taihang, 28th dispatch] After our Shouyang Independent Battalion captured the "Revenge Brigade Commander" Huo Jihan alive in the battle of Danao (eight miles away from the Qinquan stronghold) on the 7th of this month, the Yan stubborn army's internal situation became unstable and uneasy. On the night of the 11th, the "Revenge Team" stationed in Hedicun (ten miles away from Mashou Station), led by squad leader Guo Chanxiao and two team members, carrying two rifles and more than forty rounds of ammunition, defected and returned to us. It is said that many people who participated in the "Revenge Team" now regret it and secretly spread the word: "Huo Jihan was caught, and we don't know which day it will be our turn!" At the same time, they also talked about the lack of food in Yan's stubborn army, using the excuse of checking household registrations to find out where the masses stored grain during the day, and then under the pretext of "preventing bandits," they did not allow the masses to go out a step at night, stealing all the hidden grain. A Yan puppet soldier who fled back said: "Working for Yan Xishan for one day is like deceiving yourself for one day."
    [This newspaper dispatch] From the 7th to the 15th of this month, seven soldiers of the Jiang army in Tangyin and Anyang fled to our area. They were all conscripted as forced laborers, subjected to beatings and abuse, and constantly attacked by our army and guerrillas, unable to live in peace day and night. Among them, three were from the puppet Sun Dianying's troops, who escaped from Hebi, and the other four were from the 40th Division, who fled from Anyang City. According to Jin Tiansheng, who fled from Hebi on the 7th: He was from the guard squad of the battalion headquarters of the 1st Regiment, 2nd Battalion (6th General Team). When they first arrived in Hebi, there were fourteen people in the guard squad, but when he left, there were only six left, and they were constantly running away every day. (Ren Yi)

　　辉县蒋区青壮年
    相继逃来解放区
    【本报太行二十八日电】辉县爱国保丁工作，已获很大成绩，月前由蒋管区逃来我解放区的刘风方、郭振江两家十四口人，受到我民主政府招待、救济后，非常兴奋，自动回去宣传我民主政府爱民政策，揭破敌人欺骗宣传，即有二十八个青壮年相继来解放区。民主政府立即拨给救济粮每人小米四百斤，并贷给五石二斗玉茭作为生产基金。他们深感民主政府亲如爹娘，要求武装自己，和蒋伪斗争。除一部分人组织生产互助外，一部分人组成游击小组，每夜往返数十里，通过敌人的炮楼、据点，解放青壮年。不到一个月，他们连续带来青壮年八十余人。
    【本报太行二十八日电】我寿阳独立营于本月七日，在大垴（距芹泉据点八里地）战斗活捉“复仇大队长”霍逆继汉后，阎顽军内部动摇不安。十一日夜住河底村（距马首车站十里）之“复仇队”，有班长郭蝉小带领队员二名，携带步枪二支，子弹四十余发，反正来归。据说：参加了“复仇队”的人，现在许多后悔，秘密传说：“霍继汉还被捉住，咱们也不知道那一天呀！”同时并谈到阎顽粮食缺乏，借口检查户口，白天发现群众粮食存放地点，夜间以“防匪”为名，不让群众外出一步，将藏粮悉数偷去。逃回阎伪军说：“给阎锡山干一天，就等于自己欺哄自己一天。”
    【本报讯】从本月七号起到十五号汤阴安阳蒋军士兵七名逃到我区来。他们都是抓来的壮丁，挨打受气，又经我军与游击队的不时的打击，昼夜不能安生。其中三名是伪孙殿英部，是从鹤壁里跑出来的，另四名是四十师的，从安阳城跑来。据七号从鹤壁跑出来的金天胜谈：他是一团二营（六总队）营部警卫班的，他们刚到鹤壁时警卫班有十四个人来，他出来时只丢下六个人了，，每天都不断的在逃跑。（任一）
