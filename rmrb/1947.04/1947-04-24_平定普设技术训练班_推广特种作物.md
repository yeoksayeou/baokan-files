    Pingding Widely Establishes Technical Training Classes
    Promotes Special Crops
    [This newspaper, Pingding dispatch] The Pingding Construction Section has widely established small-scale agricultural technology training classes in base villages in various districts to improve farming techniques and promote special crops (cotton, indigo, golden queen corn, hemp...). The approach is decentralized, small-scale, and short-term. Technical instruction is provided according to the needs of each season (for example, for cotton planting, a cotton field of a specially appointed farmer in each base village is used as a practice field). What technology is needed, what technology is taught (such as threshing, branching, topping, treating oily sweat, etc.), production committee members, labor heroes, and skilled old farmers who are enthusiastic about planting cotton and indigo in the entire base village are gathered, and cadres from the Agriculture and Forestry Bureau or skilled veterans in cotton planting and cultivation from old liberated areas are personally taught. Each session only takes half a day, which minimizes the disruption of work. In the first short training session (land preparation, seed selection, fertilization, sowing), the focus was on cotton planting and the promotion of hemp and other crops, which solved many ideological and technical problems. For example, in the new district, cotton planting was viewed as "each place has its own characteristics, and I will never learn it in my lifetime"; last year, boiling water was used for seed soaking, which damaged the seeds, and it was said that "the harvest is up to heaven and the climate is not right"; deep plowing made it difficult for the seedlings to emerge, and it was said that "the soil here is tight and not suitable for cotton planting"; branching and topping were not done well, and only branches and leaves grew, and it was said that "it is better not to plant than to waste land and suffer"; too many bolls were left, and late flowers could not open, and it was said that "the climate is not right, we cannot harvest here". After everyone's discussion, Chen Song, a skilled cotton planter, used the three cotton plants left over from last year as specimens for everyone to see (well-branched, late-branched, and unbranched). And Donggubei Village harvested 23 jin of pure cotton from six fen of cotton land last year, and other facts cleared everyone's minds and made them realize that it was not that cotton could not be grown, but that there was a lack of technology, so everyone was very eager for technology. After the small-scale technical training, each village is very enthusiastic about planting cotton this year. According to county statistics, the villages in each district plan to plant a total of 8,100 mu.
    [Another dispatch] Zhai Gaoshan, a labor hero from Niujiaogou, recently established a technical research group in Xigubei Village, with participants from ten villages (deputy village chiefs, labor heroes, and skilled old farmers within ten li). The method is: according to the season of agricultural crops, what technology should be researched, and practice in the determined experimental field for a short time of half a day or less, to research and exchange experiences, and then return to the village to lead and promote separately. The labor hero of Xigubei has sorted out one mu of land to specially plant cotton, as the experimental field for the group. The techniques of land preparation, fertilization, and seed selection have now been practiced, and are being led and promoted in the village separately. Recently, the practice and techniques of sowing will be carried out. (Sheng Xi)

    平定普设技术训练班
    推广特种作物
    【本报平定讯】平定建设科在各区基点村普设农技小型训练班，以提高农作技术，推广特种作物（棉、靛、金皇后、大麻……）。做法是以分散的，小型的，短期的。按每个季节的需要进行技术传授（如植棉在每个基点村找一特约农户之棉田作为实习场），须要干啥时，就传授什么技术（如脱谷、打杈、打顶、治油汗等），把全基点村的生产委员劳动英雄及热心植棉、蓝等能手老农召集来，由农林局干部或聘请老区植棉、种植等能手亲自教，每期只用半日时间，这样少误工。第一期短训中（整地、选种、施肥、下种），重点是植棉并推广大麻子等，解决了不少的思想和技术等问题。如新区对植棉认为“一方水土一方人，自己一辈子也学不会”；去年浸种用开水，把籽烫坏了，说是“天年不收气候不对”，耕的深不易出土，说是“咱这里土紧不宜种棉”，没打好杈和顶，光长枝叶，说是“丢了地受了苦不如不种”，桃留的多，晚花碰不开，说是“气候不行，咱这里不沾”。经大家讨论，最后由植棉能手陈松把去年留的三棵棉花作标本，让大家看过（打杈好的，打杈迟的，没打杈的）。及东古贝村在去年六分棉花收净花二十三斤等等的事实，打通了大家思想，认识了不是不沾，是缺乏技术，所以大家对技术要求十分迫切。经过小型技术训练后，各村对今年种棉劲头十分高，全县统计，各区村计划共种八千一百亩。
    【又讯】牛角沟劳动英雄翟高山近在西古贝村创立一技术研究小组，参加者十村（附近十里以内副村长劳英能手老农），办法是：按农作物季节，该做啥研究啥的技术，以半日或不够半日的短小时间，到确定的实验地里实习，研究交流经验，再回村分头领导推动。西古贝劳英，整理了地一亩专种棉花，做小组的试验场。现已将整地、施肥、选种等技术，实习过了，正分头在村领导推广中。最近将进行实习下种的做法和技术。（盛僖）
