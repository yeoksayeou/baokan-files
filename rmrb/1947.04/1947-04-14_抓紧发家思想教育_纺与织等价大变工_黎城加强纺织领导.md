　　Grasp Ideological Education on Getting Rich
    Equivalent Work Exchange Between Spinning and Weaving
    Licheng Strengthens Leadership in Textile Industry
    [Report from this newspaper in Licheng] The main characteristics of the ongoing hundred-day textile movement in Licheng are: heroes taking the lead, coupled with strong supervision, inspection, rewards, and commendations from cadres, combined with individual ideological mobilization.

　　At the beginning of the movement, women generally had the misconception that "spinning and weaving are for public use." Zhang Guiying, the model spinning and weaving team leader in Chiyu, used the example of "the public has always focused on men's mutual aid production, but the grain harvested is still their own" to dispel her mother-in-law's fear of handing over the produce to the public. Some landlords in Dongwang were afraid of facing struggle again due to textile production. Guiying patiently explained to them, "The masses left you the textile tools so that you can produce." Afterwards, they actively participated in textile production. Many older women felt that "they are old and cannot learn spinning and weaving." The Third District put forward the mobilization slogan "Don't be afraid of not learning, just be afraid of being impatient," thereby organizing 92% of women aged thirteen to fifty-five to join the textile movement, and 405 girls and older women also voluntarily participated in spinning and weaving (based on surveys in the First and Fourth Districts). During the movement, Li Xiulian, the textile hero of Taihang, personally tested and promoted the accelerated spinning wheel, and the First District alone developed 316 wheels. Zhang Sanping, a textile expert from Zheng She, used his experience of spinning twenty liang of thread per day with the accelerated spinning wheel to train more than a hundred people in collaboration with the district cooperative to learn how to use the accelerated spinning wheel. Dong Lifat, the Taihang model for culture and education, promoted the hundred-wheel spinning movement in San Gao based on the new educational policy—the spirit of production education, thereby mobilizing over 90% of teachers and students in the county's schools to operate 651 spinning wheels. Cadres went from house to house to weigh the thread, organized thread comparison and selection, promptly broadcast commendations and rewards to win red flags, and organized work exchange scoring and dividend distribution, which all played a significant role in promoting the movement. However, due to the insufficient implementation of the mass line and democratic style, some women did not have a clear understanding of actively producing and getting rich based on their liberation, and the policy of exchanging work between spinning and weaving and family dividend distribution was not fully and correctly promoted, which led to the movement not being enthusiastic and consolidated in some areas. Therefore, according to surveys in the First and Fourth Districts, only 25% of the hundred-day plan was completed in thirty days (the plan was to weave 146,000 jin, and 36,704 jin had been woven). Secondly, in the case of a shortage of carpenters, the failure to effectively organize scattered carpenters to concentrate their efforts to solve the textile tools also created difficulties for the development of the movement.

　　Recently, after cadres throughout the county inspected the hundred-day textile plan, they ideologically clarified that textiles are the key to universally achieving the goal of "three days of farming with one day's surplus" and getting rich throughout the county. Based on the concept of "men till and women weave," they are determined to implement the textile movement in every production season throughout the year. On the basis of the masses' enthusiasm for getting rich after liberation, combined with the large-scale production movement, a comprehensive ideological mobilization for production is carried out among women throughout the county to eliminate the backward elements in textiles. The mass line is implemented in ideological mobilization, starting from the perspective of harmonious families and women's liberation, implementing family dividend distribution, and truly achieving equivalent value for spinning and weaving, in order to improve and consolidate women's textile enthusiasm and truly organize women into the textile movement ideologically. In order to vigorously develop textiles, efforts should be concentrated on solving textile tools, greatly promoting accelerated spinning wheels, and emphasizing the improvement of technology, organizing sales, and implementing short-term plans, striving to quickly complete the hundred-day textile plan.

### 抓紧发家思想教育  纺与织等价大变工  黎城加强纺织领导

　　抓紧发家思想教育
    纺与织等价大变工
    黎城加强纺织领导
    【本报黎城讯】黎城百日纺织运动开展的主要特点是：英雄带头与干部有力的督促检查奖励表扬，结合着进行个别思想动员。
    运动一开始，妇女中普遍存在着“纺织交公”错觉。赤峪纺织模范组长张桂英用“历年来公家对男人互助生产抓的很紧，但打下粮食却是自己的”来打掉了她婆母怕交公思想。东旺有些地主怕纺织生产再受斗争，桂英耐心对他们解释“群众给你们留下纺织工具，就是让你们生产”，以后她们积极的参加了纺织。不少老婆们觉得“自己老啦，学不会纺织”。三区提出了“不怕学不会，单怕不耐心”的动员口号，由此组织了十三岁至五十五岁妇女百分之九十二加入纺织运动，四百零五个女儿童和老婆也都自动参加纺织（以上是一、四区调查）。运动过程中，太行纺织英雄李秀莲亲身试用与推广加速轮大纺车，仅一区已发展到三百一十六辆。正社纺织能手张三平，用加速轮纺车以每日纺二十两线的经验，协同区联社训练了百余人学会使用加速轮纺车。太行文教模范董立法根据新教育方针——生产教育的精神，在三高推动百轮纺车运动，由此发动全县学校有百分之九十以上师生开动着六百五十一辆纺车。干部挨户称线，组织比线评选，及时广播表扬奖励夺取红旗以及组织变工评分分红等办法，对运动前进均起了很大的推动作用。但由于群众路线民主作风贯彻的不够，有些妇女在翻身基础上积极生产发家致富思想不够明确，加以纺与织变工、家庭分红政策没有全面正确的推广，致使有些地区开展的不够热烈与巩固。因此，根据一、四区调查，三十天中仅完成百日计划百分之二十五（计划织十四万六千斤，已织出三万六千七百零四斤）。其次，在木工缺乏情况下，未能有效的将零散木工组织起来，集中力量来解决纺织工具，也造成了运动发展的困难。
    最近全县干部检查了百日纺织计划后，思想上明确了纺织是全县普遍实现耕三余一发家致富的关键，根据男耕女织观点，决心把纺织运动贯彻到全年每个生产季节中去。在群众翻身后积极要求发家致富的热情上，结合大生产运动，对全县妇女进行全面生产思想大动员，消灭纺织落后层。在思想动员中贯彻群众路线，从和睦家庭与妇女解放观点出发，实行家庭分红，并作到纺与织真正等价，以提高巩固妇女纺织情绪，真正从思想上把妇女组织到纺织运动中来。为了有力开展纺织，应集中力量解决纺织工具，大大推广加速轮纺车，并应强调提高技术，组织推销，贯彻短期计划，争取百日纺织计划迅速完成。
