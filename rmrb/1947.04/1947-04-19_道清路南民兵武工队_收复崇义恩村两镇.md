　　Daoqing Road South Militia Guerrilla Force
    Recovers Chongyi and Encun Towns
    [Report from Qinyang, this newspaper] Since our main forces have vigorously launched the Yubei Campaign, our Qinyang South Guerrilla Force, Militia Rotation Team, and Public Security Plainclothes Team have actively taken the initiative to attack. In addition to a portion covering the masses in destroying five bridges on twelve sections of the Qinmeng Highway, they also besieged the enemy in Qinyang City and Chongyi Village. On the 29th of last month, the Sixth District Guerrilla Force and Zhu Qiuyun Rotation Team advanced to the vicinity of Chongyi to attack the enemy. On the night of April 1st, Chongyi was tightly surrounded, and the three companies of stubborn security regiments were very panicked. At 8:00 AM on the 2nd, our Xi Zhixin Plainclothes Team, Zhu Qiuyun Rotation Team, and Guo Shaofeng Guerrilla Force ambushed on both sides of the highway north of Chongyi. In the morning, two companies of regular enemy troops from Meng County reinforced Chongyi. The three security companies fled towards Qinyang City at 12:00 noon, entering our ambush circle. Under the fierce shooting of our machine guns, three enemies were wounded, and they immediately fled north in panic and embarrassment. Our plainclothes team, rotation team, and guerrilla force bravely took the lead, chasing directly to Shagangpu, ten miles south of Qinyang City. A total of one enemy was killed, thirteen were wounded, and one was captured. We suffered no casualties. Many items such as blood-stained clothes, food bags, bullet bags, blankets, and flashlights were abandoned on the road. At 4:00 PM, our army returned to the vicinity of Chongyi and besieged and attacked the regular army that had just arrived from Meng County. The enemy was even more panicked and secretly fled into Qinyang City at dawn on the 3rd. Chongyi was then recovered by us. The enemy was extremely panicked when they left, and they did not take away the packed bags. Our army seized more than 1,500 rounds of ammunition, one and a half boxes of rifle grenades, one box of grenade launcher rounds, and fifty military blankets and quilts. Since then, the Qinmeng Highway, a vital transportation route to Luoyang, has been cut off by us. Currently, the ten city towers that the enemy forced thousands of people to build around Chongyi Village for four and a half months have been leveled by us.

    [Report from this newspaper] The entire Third District south of Daoqing Road has been liberated. On the 28th of last month, after our battalion soldiers and militiamen received combat missions, they immediately advanced to the south of the road. First, they cleared out the "Homecoming Corps" in Dinghe, Wangzhu, and other villages, and then, in coordination with a part of the main force, recovered Encun Town on April 1st, completely eliminating more than 60 members of the puppet town government's "Homecoming Corps". Since then, the entire Third District has been liberated. The enemy in Jiaozuo Lifeng has also been completely compressed into strongholds, fearing to move out.

　　道清路南民兵武工队
    收复崇义恩村两镇
    【本报沁阳讯】自我主力猛烈开展豫北战役后，我沁（阳）南武工队、民兵轮战队、公安便衣队，即积极主动出击，除一部掩护群众破击沁孟公路十二段桥梁五座外，并围困沁阳城和崇义寨之敌。上月廿九日，我六区武工队祝秋云轮战队，即进至崇义附近袭击敌人。四月一日夜，崇义团团围困，顽保安团三个中队十分恐慌，二日早八时我席志新便衣队、祝秋云轮战队、郭少峰武工队在崇义北公路两侧设伏。上午，由孟县敌增援正规军两连驻崇义，该三个保安中队于上午十二时向沁阳城逃跑，进入我伏击圈内，在我机枪猛烈射击下，打伤敌三名，立即慌乱狼狈向北逃窜。我便衣队、轮战队和武工队个个奋勇当先，直追至沁阳城南十里之沙岗铺。共打死敌人一名，伤十三名，俘一名，我无伤亡。路上遗弃之血衣、饭包、子弹袋、毡子、手电等物品很多。下午四点，我军又返回崇义附近，围困袭击新从孟县开来之正规军。该敌更加恐慌，乃于三日拂晓偷偷逃窜沁阳城内，崇义当为我收复。敌走时恐慌已极，打好之背包，均未带走，我军缴获子弹一千五百余发，枪榴弹一箱半，掷弹筒弹一箱、军毡、被子各五十余条。自此通往洛阳之交通要道——沁孟公路，已被我斩断。现崇义寨周围，敌人强迫数千人民修筑四个半月之十座城楼，已被我平毁。

    【本报讯】道清路南三区全部解放。上月二十八日，我营兵、民兵接收作战任务后，随即挺向路南，首将定和、王诸等村“还乡团”扫清，接着配合主力一部，于四月一日光复恩村镇，将伪镇公所“还乡团”六十余人完全消灭。从此三区全获解放。焦作李封之敌，亦完全压缩在据点里去，恐惧不敢出动。
