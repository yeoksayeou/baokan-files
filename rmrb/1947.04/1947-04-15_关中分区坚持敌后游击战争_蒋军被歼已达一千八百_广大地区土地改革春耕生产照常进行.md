Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th – In the Guanzhong Sub-district of Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia, only a little over 100 miles from Hu Zongnan's lair in Xi'an, land reform and spring plowing continue as usual in most areas, except for a few scattered strongholds occupied by Jiang's troops in places like Malan, Liulin, Miaowan, Shimen Pass, Zhuanjiao, and Guanmenzi. From late February to April 4th, a total of 1,812 Jiang's troops have been eliminated by the local military and civilians. Among them, 504 were killed or wounded, including regimental commanders and lower ranks. 4 officers were captured including battalion commanders Zhang Jiliang, Liu Yanjun, and 1,304 soldiers, seized two rocket launchers, 17 cannons of various sizes, 226 light and heavy machine guns and hand-held weapons, 767 rifles, and 130,000 rounds of ammunition. On March 21st, in the battle of Wutingzi in Xinning, four main companies of the 2nd Regiment of the enemy's New First Brigade were wiped out in one fell swoop, killing or wounding over 80 enemies and capturing Battalion Commander Liu Yanjun, Deputy Battalion Commander Zeng Jiliang, and over 200 soldiers. When Chi Shui Tiewang Town was recovered on the 24th, the first and third battalions of the enemy's Seventh Security Regiment were eliminated, killing, wounding, and capturing 340 enemies. On the 21st, they raided Liulin once, capturing more than a dozen enemy soldiers and weapons. On the 22nd, they encountered the enemy's Fourth Security Regiment in Gaoer Yuan, capturing 65 people, including the company commander.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th – Ke Lan reported: The "Dongming" unit in Northern Shaanxi has specially issued a mimeographed small commemorative册 (cè) to commemorate the "Niuwushan Martyrs' Class." The first page contains inscriptions by the leaders of the unit, followed by a list of the names of the martyrs of the class and an account of the battle of Niuwushan. At dawn on March 14th, Gao Micheng, the squad leader of the Third Squad of the "Dongming" unit, led nine soldiers, including two who had recently joined the People's Liberation Army, to defend Niuwushan. When our army's frontal position began to shift, three or four hundred Jiang's troops rushed towards the right flank position held by the Third Squad. The soldiers of the Third Squad quickly threw down seven or eight hand grenades, and a dozen enemies rolled down the hillside. The enemy immediately bombarded with artillery and aircraft. The soldiers of the Third Squad steadfastly held their ground. The enemy could not charge up from the front and went around from the left side of the mountain for a two-sided attack. A soldier who had just been liberated said: "Deputy Squad Leader, this won't do!" Gao Micheng said: "We must hold our position and absolutely not retreat!" After repelling four or five enemy attacks, they heroically sacrificed themselves after running out of ammunition.
