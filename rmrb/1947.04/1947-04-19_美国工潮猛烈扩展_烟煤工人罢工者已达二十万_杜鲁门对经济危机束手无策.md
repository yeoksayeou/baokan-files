Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th: New York dispatch: After a winter truce, the wave of worker strikes in the United States has erupted again on a large scale. The strike of 300,000 telephone workers across the United States has persisted for a week, constituting a serious blow to American industry and commerce. The anthracite coal workers of the United Mine Workers of America had over 200,000 strikers at the beginning of the week, and the number of strikers continues to increase recently. Furthermore, a strike of workers in the basic American industry of steel is planned to begin on May 1st. Another strike of automobile workers, aimed at General Motors, is currently brewing. Additionally, 50,000 telegraph operators have recently issued a strike notice to Western Union Telegraph Company, which monopolizes domestic telecommunications in the United States.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th: Washington dispatch: The United States is currently under attack from rising prices and inflation, which has made the American economic crisis increasingly imminent. To this end, Truman convened a special White House meeting on the 9th of this month to discuss the American economic problem with his cabinet members and senior economic advisors. No measures have yet been decided to curb the worsening economic trends and the continuing rise in prices. At a press conference on the 10th of this month, Truman called on capital to reduce prices to resist the crisis of inflation. If the serious economic situation in the United States cannot be curbed quickly and effectively, it will inevitably lead to serious unemployment and economic recession. Regarding what measures the government will take, Truman said that the State Council and the President's Economic Advisory Committee have carefully considered it, and said that the government has no intention of restoring price controls. Mr. Truman emphasized: "The government can only use moral force to persuade capital to reduce unnecessarily high prices." However, when asked about "what measures will be taken if the government's moral persuasion cannot stop inflation," Truman refused to answer.

　　美国工潮猛烈扩展
    烟煤工人罢工者已达二十万
    杜鲁门对经济危机束手无策
    【新华社陕北十三日电】纽约讯：美国工人罢工浪潮，经一冬季之休战，顷已再度大规模爆发。全美电话业三十万工人之罢工，迄今已坚持一周，对美国工商业实一严重打击。美国业工会烟煤工，罢工人数周初即达二十万人以上，最近罢工人数仍继续增加中。而美国基本工业钢铁业工人之罢工，亦计划于五月一日开始举行。针对通用汽车公司而拟举行之另一次汽车工人之罢工，刻在酝酿中。另有报务员工五万人，日前已向垄断美国境内电讯交通之西方联合电报公司提出罢工通知。
    【新华社陕北十三日电】华盛顿讯：目前美国遭受物价上涨及通货膨胀的袭击，已使美国经济危机日益迫近。为此，杜鲁门特于本月九日召开了一次白宫特别会议，与其阁员及高级经济顾问讨论美国经济问题。对于日趋恶化的经济趋势，以及继续上涨之物价，迄未能决定任何遏止的对策。在本月十日的记者招待会上，杜鲁门吁请资方以降低物价，抵御通货膨胀之危机。美国之严重经济情势若不能迅速有效遏止，势必招致严重的失业及经济不景气。关于政府方面如何措施，杜鲁门国谓务院及总统经济顾问委员会，已经慎重考虑，并谓政府无意恢复物价管制。杜氏强调称：“政府仅可以道德力量劝请资方减低不必要之高价。”但对于若“政府道德上劝导不能制止通货膨胀时，则将采取如何措施”问题，杜鲁门拒未作答。
