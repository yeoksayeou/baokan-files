Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 14th -- According to a report in the Shanghai Wenhui Daily on March 11th: The people's armed uprising in southern Guangdong has strengthened, and Chiang's troops are unable to "suppress" it. Since the magistrate of Suixi County was killed while leading a team to "suppress" the uprising some days ago, the counties in southern Guangdong have become tense, and Guangzhou Bay has been under curfew for days. The Chiang's special commissioner's office in southern Guangdong convened a so-called "Pacification Conference" and organized a so-called "剿匪 [Bandit Suppression] Command Post" in an attempt to launch another round of "suppression" separately. However, there is only one brigade of Chiang's troops stationed in Guangdong, which can only take care of Guangzhou city and the surrounding counties. The ten regiments of its "Security Command" have been transferred to Hainan Island to "suppress the people's uprising", and the remaining four regiments have to take care of the eighty-odd counties in the East, West, and North River and Han River basins, making it impossible to stop the development of the people's armed forces.

　　广东民变武装壮大
    蒋军空虚顾此失彼
    【新华社华中十四日电】据三月十一日沪文汇报消息：广东南路民变武装壮大，蒋军无法“清剿”。自日前遂溪县长率队“清剿”被击毙后，南路各县顿告紧张，广州湾连日宣布戒严。南路蒋专署特召开“绥靖会议”，组织所谓“剿匪指挥所”，企图再打分头“清剿”。但广东境内蒋驻军仅有一旅，只能顾住广州市及附近各县，其“保安司令部”十个团队已调赴琼崖“镇压民变”，仅余之四个团则要顾住东西北三江及韩江流域八十余县，无法阻止人民武装之发展。
