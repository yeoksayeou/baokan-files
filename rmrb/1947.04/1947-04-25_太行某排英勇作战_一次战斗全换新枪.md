    A Certain Platoon in Taihang Fights Bravely:
    All New Guns After One Battle
    [Report from the Yu Bei Front, our newspaper] A certain platoon of the Taihang Fifth Military Sub-district's local forces was one of the main attacking units in the battle to attack Qixian County. During the attack, it was led by Deputy Platoon Leader Yang Shouchong. After they successfully climbed over the city wall and rushed to West Street, they encountered a cavalry platoon of the enemy. Machine gun squad leaders and deputy squad leaders Li An and Qiao Yongchang immediately opened fire on the spot, catching the enemy off guard. The enemy hurriedly retreated into the courtyard. The soldiers used hand grenades to pursue them and ordered them to surrender their weapons. When the hand grenades were thrown into the courtyard, the enemy shouted, "We surrender! We surrender!..." Yang Shouchong's soldiers victoriously concluded the first battle. The platoon continued to advance and discovered another group of enemies. At this time, another platoon from the same company also rushed over, and together they scattered the enemy. The soldiers chased after them closely, and the enemy was so scared that they stood motionless like puppets. As the battle was about to end, six more enemies carrying a mortar ran over from the east. Yang Shouchong raised a grenade and said, "Leave the cannon for me!" The enemies, as if they had seen an official, respectfully placed the cannon on the ground and surrendered. At this moment, the slowly rising moon shone on the joyful faces of the soldiers. A mortar, fifty-six rifles and pistols, a machine gun, and many other spoils of war were shining brightly. Every soldier had replaced their old gun with a new one, and everyone laughed heartily.

    太行某排英勇作战
    一次战斗全换新枪
    【本报豫北前线讯】太行五分区地方兵团某排是攻击淇县城战斗中主攻部队之一，攻城时由副排长杨守忠率领，当他们顺利地爬过城墙，冲到西大街后，碰着敌人一个骑兵排，机枪班正副班长李安、乔永昌马上就地扫射，把敌人打得措手不及，连忙往院里钻，战士们用手榴弹跟踪追击，并命令他们缴枪。当手榴弹扔到院子里的时候，敌人发出了“我们缴枪！我们缴枪！……”的回答。杨守忠的战士们胜利的结束了第一个战斗。该排继续前进，又发现一股敌人。这时，该连的另一个排也冲过来了，共同把敌人打得四散逃奔，战士们紧追上去，敌人吓的像木偶一样，动也不敢动。战斗快要结束了，东面又有六个敌人扛着一门迫击炮跑过来，杨守忠举起炸弹说：“给我把炮留下！”敌人像见了官长一样，尊尊敬敬的把炮放在地上，束手待擒。这时，徐徐上升的月亮照耀着战士们愉快的笑脸，一门迫击炮、五十六支长短枪、一挺机枪及许多战利品，闪闪的发光。战士们每个人都换了新枪，大家都哈哈的笑了起来。
