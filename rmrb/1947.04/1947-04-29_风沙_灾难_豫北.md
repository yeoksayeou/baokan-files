Wind, Sand, Disaster, Northern Henan
·Wu Xiang·
    I followed the army to northern Henan, including the counties of Hua, Jun, Qi, Ji, Xinxiang, Yuanwu, Yangwu, Fengqiu, and Yanjin, as well as Changyuan in Hebei. The ancient Yellow River had repeatedly flowed back and forth here, leaving behind mounds and mounds of barren sand. In the spring, the wind and sand howled and roared, darkening the sky and obscuring the sun. This disaster-stricken land, after suffering the ravages of the Japanese invaders, has fallen into even greater and deeper disaster under the heavy blows of Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous civil war.
    The people's faces were tea-colored, and they generally ate sorghum and chaff. How heavy were their burdens? I couldn't find a definite answer. Many ragged peasants, when asked, only responded with dry, bitter smiles. The number was so large, and the frequency so high, that they themselves had lost track. Liu Zongjue, the Kuomintang county magistrate of Fengqiu, wrote to a friend "complaining": "The burden of this county from October of the 34th year to December 15th of the 35th year is: (1) The amount of various apportioned funds is 931,892,673 yuan. (2) The amount of wheat not included in the procurement is 6,224,401 catties. (3) Miscellaneous grains 2,035,445 catties. (4) Wheat bran 320,139 catties. (5) Firewood 7,229,306 catties. (6) Straw about 3 million catties. (7) Clothing 1,246 sets. (8) Bricks 18,422,000. (9) Carts 3,992. (10) Furniture 9,984 sets. (11) Planks 14,140. (12) Wooden strips 5,634. (13) Laborers 66,183." Moreover, "the above are based on orders with documented records, and the number of direct requisitions by other troops is more than three times higher." Then this "county magistrate" also sighed that "the people cannot bear it," but what he truly sighed about was definitely not the "suffering of the people," but rather the endless extortion and exploitation, which affected his own illicit gains. In fact, beyond all the shocking figures, there was even more shocking corruption and embezzlement at every level. Junxian County once procured 380,000 catties of "military grain." After being weighed at the military station, 35,000 catties were missing. Later, when paying grain to the 5th Pacification Zone sub-bureau military station, the grain collectors nitpicked about the poor quality of the wheat. The local people understood the secret: first send bribes, and then one hundred catties was counted as ninety-five catties, so that the payment could be made smoothly. A doggerel poem says it well: "If you want a wide road, be a corrupt official; using money to buy the road makes the road even wider. If you want to feast, be a councilor; delicacies are free. If you want a salary, be a section chief; three months as section chief yields two *qing* of land." Another "Man Jiang Hong" writes: "Corrupt officials feast on the flesh of the people, laughing and drinking the blood of the common people." In several places, I saw broken windows patched with "legal tender." How much resentment and anger are the people silently accumulating!
    The Eighth Route Army's X Regiment stayed overnight in Mazhuang, southeast of Xinxiang City. This was a small village with only forty households and eight hundred *mu* of land. The political director's landlord was a *jia* chief. While they were "chatting," the *jia* chief took out a three- or four-inch-thick stack of strips of paper of varying sizes and said: "This is the expenditure of the Central Army from July to September last year. Do you think we can survive?" The director used an abacus to calculate. In total, there were 597,470 yuan, 5,120 catties of firewood, and 5,961 catties of rice and wheat combined. Unexpectedly, the *jia* chief said: "No, no! Many must not have been included. Just that one time, entertaining the people sent to urge the grain cost more than 130,000!" Some landlords with shallower connections to the government were also driven to desperation. A widow surnamed Zhang in Dongnao Village, east of Yangwu City, originally had three and a half *qing* of land. After selling land to pay taxes, she had less than two *qing* left. Li Fengquan of Wangliantun, Xinxiang, partnered with others to open the "Taixing General Merchandise Store" in Xinxiang City. Due to the sluggish business and excessive taxes, the store closed down. He returned home with no means of sustenance, and the grain tax apportioned by the village was weighing down on him. I personally encountered these two families, and I believe that similar examples can be found in every village. However, at the entrance of villages in this area, neat large characters are brushed with "Chairman Chiang's" "political program": "Severely punish corruption! Vigorously practice thrift! Increase production! Revitalize the countryside!"
    The burden is heavy because there are too many "soldiers." When Chiang Kai-shek launched a large-scale offensive against the JiluYu Liberated Area, the city of Yanjin, which was less than two *li* wide and long, was garrisoned by more than five divisions. The disaster of having too many soldiers was not only economic. The ensuing conscription, forced labor, and even robbery and rape caused even greater terror and chaos. The troops of Zhang Jikun and Wang Haiting, who were sometimes Kuomintang and sometimes puppet troops during the Anti-Japanese War, after being formally incorporated by Chiang, committed all kinds of evil in Yanjin, arousing resistance from local militia. As a result, they failed, and more than sixty villages were brutally burned and killed. In Luanqiu Village alone, seventy people died.
    The more cowardly Chiang's rule is, the more tyrannical it becomes. The "new county system" that is being "actively promoted" stipulates: "Recompile the *baojia* system to ensure that every person belongs to a household, and every household belongs to a *jia*." "Thoroughly cleanse the villages and implement joint liability." "Establish secret voluntary police, mobile teams, and commando teams in the countryside." "Implement national identification cards and strictly register." The "News Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense" also trained a large number of "loyal party (league) members" to form so-called "People's Service Teams" to "advance with the bandit suppression troops" and put those fascist shackles on the people, yet shamelessly call them "a fresh force to strengthen revolutionary action and carry out political struggle." Many of these "fresh forces" were captured alive by the Eighth Route Army. Six were captured in one instance west of Changyuan City, along with an intelligence training class they were running. When they were lined up, I found two extremely small children among them, one named Guo Zhen'en and the other named Xu Jinxiu, both only thirteen years old. I couldn't help but ask in surprise: "Can you be a *jia* chief? Can you be an intelligence officer?" The children were very scared, blinking and holding back tears, finally unable to stop crying. Someone next to me said: After three weeks of training, they had to bring 13,000 yuan, sixty catties of rice, and one hundred catties of firewood themselves, and no one wanted to go. There was no way, so later each family had one person draw paper lots, no matter if they were adults or children, whoever drew the lot was out of luck. I was half-believing, half-doubting, and wanted to ask more questions. Suddenly, a haggard, yellow, and thin middle-aged woman rushed out of the crowd, hugging Xu Jinxiu and wailing: "I can't let you go! I'll die with you!" The voice was so sorrowful, the scene so tragic. The villagers all gathered to watch, chattering that this was his mother, from Xiaosima Village in the neighboring village, who had been a widow for more than ten years and only had this one child. After the comrade in charge of dealing with the prisoners investigated and clarified the situation, he released him on the spot and gave him kind comfort. This woman with disheveled hair seemed to feel too surprised, dazed for a long time, and suddenly pulled the child and knelt down to kowtow. This comrade hastily helped them up, with blurry tears welling up in his eyes, and many villagers reached out to wipe their tears. An old lady even cried out loud. My heart was very heavy, and I didn't know how deep the people's suffering was...
    The People's Liberation Army's great strides forward greatly encouraged the people of northern Henan and the People's Guerrilla, who persisted in their arduous struggle. Of course, the traitor Chiang Kai-shek will never be willing to give up on this, and more serious struggles are still ahead. However, the people of northern Henan and the People's Guerrilla will surely become more active and receive more powerful assistance from the Liberation Army. The flames of survival cannot be extinguished by anyone. The sand dunes east of Yangwu City, according to legend, are the Bolangsha where Zhang Liang ambushed Qin Shi Huang. There are many sand dunes in northern Henan, and countless iron mallets will be waiting there for the Jiang bandit who is indulging in cruelty.

　　风沙·灾难·豫北
    ·吴象·
    我随军到了豫北的滑县、浚县、淇县、汲县、新乡、原武、阳武、封邱、延津及河北长垣一带。古黄河道曾几次从这里滚来滚去，遗留下一陵一陵的荒沙。在春季，大风沙狂啸怒号，昏昏沉沉地蔽空遮日。这一片灾难的大地，饱受日寇蹂躏之后，又在蒋介石卖国内战的重击下陷入更大更深的灾难中了。
    人民面呈茶色，普遍的以高粱、糠秕为食。他们负担到底有多重？我找不到确实的答案。许多衣衫褴褛的农民被询问时都只报以干枯的苦笑。那数目之大，次数之多，已经使他们自己都弄不清楚了。封邱蒋记县长刘宗珏写信向朋友“诉苦”：“本县从三十四年十月份到三十五年十二月十五日止的负担是：（一）各种款项摊派的数目是九三一、八九二、六七三元。（二）不在代购数目的小麦是六、二二四、四○一斤。（三）杂粮二、○三五、四四五斤。（四）麸皮三二○、一三九斤。（五）木柴七、二二九、三○六斤。（六）谷草约三百万斤。（七）服装一、二四六套。（八）火砖一八、四二二、○○○块。（九）大车三、九九二辆。（十）家具九、九八四套。（十一）木板一四、一四○块。（十二）木条五、六三四根。（十三）民工六六、一八三个。”而且，“以上系补给分令有案可稽者，其他各部队直接征派之数，当高出此数三倍以上。”接着这位“县太爷”也叹息“民不堪命”了，然而他真正叹息的，决不是“民生疾苦”，而是这无穷尽的横征暴敛，影响了他自己的油水。事实上一切惊人的数字之外，还有更惊人的层层级级的贪污中饱。浚县一次代购“军粮”三十八万斤，经兵站一称，少了三万五千斤，后来向第五绥靖区分署兵站缴粮，收粮者挑剔麦子质量不好，地方上体会了其中奥妙，先送人情，然后一百斤算九十五斤，才得顺利缴纳。有一首打油诗说得好：“要路宽，做贪官，用钱买路路更宽；要解馋，当议员，山珍海味不出钱；要得饷，当科长，三个月科长两顷两。”又有一首“满江红”写道：“贪官饥餐人民肉，笑谈喝尽百姓血。”我在好几处地方，看见窗户的破窟窿上贴补着“法币”，人民在默默无声之中，堆积着多少怨恨和愤怒啊！
    八路军×团在新乡城东南的马庄住了一夜，这是个仅有四十户八百亩地的小村，政治主任的房东是个甲长，他们“拉家常”的时候，甲长取出三四寸厚一叠大小不一的条子说：“这是中央军去年七月到九月的花费，你看我们还有法活吗？”主任用算盘打了一下，共洋五十九万七千四百七十元，柴五千一百二十斤，米麦合计五千九百六十一斤。不料甲长却说：“不对，不对！一定许多没有打进去，光那一次招待派来催粮的人，就花了十三万多！”有些与官府关系较浅的地主也走到了绝路，阳武城东东脑村张姓寡妇，原有三顷半地，卖地缴款，只剩了不到两顷。新乡王连屯李凤全，与人合伙在新乡城开“泰兴杂货铺”，因生意萧条捐税过重倒闭，回家衣食无着，村里摊派的粮款又压到头上来了。这两家是我亲自遇到的，我相信每个村都可以找出类似的例子。然而，这一带村庄的街口，却都用整齐的大字刷写着“蒋主席的”的“施政纲要”：“严惩贪污！厉行节约！增加生产！复兴农村！”
    负担重是因为“兵”多，蒋介石向冀鲁豫解放区大举进攻之际，纵横皆不足二里的延津城，驻扎过五个师以上。兵多的灾难不仅在经济方面，随之而来的拉夫、抓丁，甚至抢劫、奸淫，造成了更大的恐怖与混乱。抗战中时而国民党，时而伪军的张季昆、王海亭等部，受蒋正式收编后，更在延津无恶不作，激起地方会团武装抵抗。结果失败，六十余村惨遭烧杀，乱邱村一村就死了七十口人。
    蒋家统治愈是胆怯，就愈是暴虐。正在“积极推行”的“新县制”中规定：“重编保甲，务使人必归户，户必归甲。”“彻底清乡，联保连坐”。“设立乡村秘密义务警察、机动队、别动队。”“制约国民身份证，严格登记。”又由“国防部新闻局”训练了大批“忠实的党（团）员”，成立所谓“人民服务队”，跟随“剿匪部队推进”，把那些法西斯枷锁套到人民头上，然而竟厚颜无耻地称之为“强化革命行动执行政治斗争的生力军”。“生力军”们被八路军活捉了不少，长垣城西的一次是六个，还有他们办的一个情报训练班。当他们列队时，我发现其中有两个极小的小孩，一个叫郭振恩，一个叫许金秀，都只有十三岁。我不禁吃惊地问：“你能当甲长？你能当情报员？”小孩很害怕，眼皮一＠一＠地忍着眼泪，终于忍不住哭起来了。旁边的人告诉我：受训三星期，要自己带一万三千元六十斤米一百斤柴，谁也不肯去。没办法，后来就每家一个人捏纸蛋，没有大人小孩顶，谁捏上谁倒霉。我正半信半疑，想再仔细问一问。忽然人丛里钻出一个憔悴黄瘦的中年妇女，抱着许金秀嚎啕痛哭起来：“我不能放你走呀！要死我同你一块去死呀！”那声音是如此的悲切，那情景是如此的凄惨。本村的老乡都围来看，七嘴八舌地说这就是他娘，邻村小司马的，守了十多年寡，就这一个孩子。负责处理俘虏的同志调查清楚后，当场释放了他，并给以亲切的安慰。这个头发散乱的女人，似乎感到太意外，茫然失神了好久，突然拉着小孩卜通一下跪下来磕头了。这位同志惶惑地扶起她们，眼里不禁涌出模糊的泪水，许多老乡都伸手擦眼泪，一位老太太竟哭出声音来了。我的心非常沉重，我不知道人民的灾难有多么深……
    人民解放军大踏步前进，大大鼓舞了豫北人民及坚持苦斗的人民游击队。当然，蒋介石卖国贼决不肯就此甘休，更严重的斗争还在后面。但是，豫北人民与人民游击队一定会更积极更活跃起来，一定会得到解放军更有力的援助。求生存的烈火，谁也扑灭不了。阳武城东的沙邱，相传是张良椎、秦始皇的博浪沙，豫北沙邱是很多的，无数的铁椎将在那里等待着残民以逞的蒋贼。
