Xinhua News Agency, Central China, April 24th: Following the great victory at Libao, the Central Jiangsu People's Liberation Army fiercely attacked Dazhongji, an important stronghold of the Chiang army north of Dongtai, and Xikou, seven miles west of it, and Xinfeng Town, fifteen miles north of it, at dawn on the 21st. The PLA recovered the two towns of Dazhongji and Xikou in just one hour of fighting. The entire defending enemy, Hao Pengju's remnant Fourth Division 12th Regiment headquarters, another infantry battalion, an artillery company, and local Chiang Kai-shek puppets were annihilated. Over 400 people, including Regiment Commander Duan Mingwu and Deputy Regiment Commander Zheng Jinghe, were captured alive. Over 100 enemies, including Deputy Regiment Commander Zhang Maoxiu, were killed or wounded. Over 200 local Chiang Kai-shek puppets, including the Chiang-appointed district head, were killed or captured, totaling over 800 people. Over 20 light and heavy machine guns, 3 mortars, hundreds of long and short guns, 2 radio stations, 2 cars, dozens of bicycles, and over 20 horses were seized. As of the time of the dispatch, the Chiang army in Xinfeng Town was still being encircled and annihilated by our Liberation Army. Dazhongji is a nationally renowned cotton-producing area. It was liberated from the Japanese invaders by the New Fourth Army in August 1945, and occupied by the Chiang army on November 20th last year. After the victory in Central Shandong, Hao Pengju's remnants fled south to this area. After the area was recovered, Liuzhuang, an important stronghold on the Tongyu Highway, was isolated.

Xinhua News Agency, Central China, April 23rd: After the North Jiangsu People's Liberation Army recovered Huji on the 16th, the Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops in Qianji, Xuliu, and other strongholds were terrified and fled back to Huaiyin together on the 18th. Thus, a section of the 150-li Huai-Shu Highway (an important supply line for the Chiang army) stretching over 100 li from Shiziqiao (15 li south of Shuyang) to Wulizhuang (30 li north of Huaiyin) is now entirely under the control of the Liberation Army.

Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, April 18th: At the beginning of this month, the Binnan guerrillas crossed the Shu River and the Longhai Railway, killing or capturing 350 Chiang Kai-shek soldiers and "Homecoming Legions," collecting over 600 catties of electric wire, and seizing over 50 long and short guns. After defeating the enemy forces invading from Chenjiabu, a certain unit that crossed the Shu River has restored the vast area east of Dashao on the west bank of the Tai River. Another guerrilla unit that raided the south side of the Longhai Railway is clearing out the "Homecoming Legions" entrenched in various strongholds near Baitabu.
