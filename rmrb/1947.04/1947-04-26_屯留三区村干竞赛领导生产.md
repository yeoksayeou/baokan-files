　　Tunliu Third District Village Cadres Launch Competition to Lead Production
　　[This dispatch from Taiyue, the 24th] The Tunliu Third District is launching a production campaign. On the 7th of this month, the district held a cadre meeting of more than 500 people, establishing five major criteria for leading production and earning merit: (1) Organize all able-bodied and semi-able-bodied laborers, especially women, to persist in mutual aid for the long term. (2) Improve the work of cultivation teams to help military families and families of revolutionary martyrs with production, ensuring that all military families and families of revolutionary martyrs do not feel difficulties in life. (3) Under any circumstances, do not delay support for the front lines and do not delay production. (4) Combine agriculture with sideline occupations, working in the fields during the busy farming season and engaging in transportation and textile work during the slack season. (5) [Missing] At the meeting, cadres from key villages such as Xucun, Shanglian, Jiaochuan, Yuedi, and Chuandiping initiated a competition to lead the masses in production and earn merit. Cadres from Yuwu Village challenged cadres from Xucun Village, proposing an average increase in coarse grain production of one *dou* per *mu* of land, and requested the district head and branch secretary to judge. Everyone unanimously resolved at the meeting to launch a competition with the Fifth District, and a "Production Merit" challenge letter was drafted on the spot and has reportedly been sent to the Fifth District.
