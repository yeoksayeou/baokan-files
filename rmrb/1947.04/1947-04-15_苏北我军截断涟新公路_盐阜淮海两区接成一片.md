Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 12th: The People's Liberation Army of Northern Jiangsu, after capturing Libao in Central Jiangsu a few days ago (the night of the 6th), also captured Xiaoliji, an important stronghold on the Lian (Lianshui) Xin (Xinan Township) Highway, 15 miles east of Lianshui. They annihilated an entire squadron of the Jiang security regiment and over 300 local Jiang-puppet troops, and destroyed more than 20 bunkers. The next morning, the regimental commander of the 484th Regiment of the 162nd Brigade of the 44th Division of the Jiang Army in Lianshui led a battalion to attack. The People's Liberation Army killed more than 20 enemy soldiers, including a deputy regimental commander, and the enemy fled back into the city in a panic. The Liberation Army pursued them all the way to the North Gate of Lianshui. In these two battles, a total of more than 320 Jiang troops below the deputy regimental commander level were annihilated, capturing 3 light machine guns, 123 rifles and carbines, and over 10,000 rounds of ammunition. Two thousand people in seven townships regained their freedom. The Lianxin Highway is the main blockade line for the Jiang army in northern Jiangsu to separate the Yanfu and Huaihai regions. After this counterattack, the two regions have been connected.

Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 13th: The People's Liberation Army of Northern Jiangsu shattered the Jiang army's "encirclement and suppression." In mid-March, the Jiang army assembled about two regiments of the 174th Brigade of the 48th Division, the New 11th Brigade of the 58th Division, one regiment of the puppet army under Sun Liangcheng, remnants of the 60th Brigade of the 69th Division, and local Jiang-puppet troops. Starting from March 18th, they launched a "sweep" against the Sihetao, Zhanji, and Longji districts of Siyang County and Sisukou, and used half of their forces to control Bancheng, Jinshuo Town, Guirenji, and Yundawei west of Hongze Lake, and Zhongji on the Sisukou Highway, establishing strongholds and conducting local "encirclement and suppression." The Jiang-puppet security teams of Huaiyin and Si counties also cooperated with local Jiang-puppet troops to harass the border areas. The Huaiyin and Si sons and soldiers, in coordination with the Hongze Lake waterborne troops in the border areas, attacked the Jiang-puppet troops in Juren Camp and Bao District southwest of the lake on March 23rd, killing and capturing 70 puppet troops, including the puppet battalion commander Deng Fanguang, and seizing 1 machine gun, more than 30 rifles, and thousands of rounds of ammunition. On the 25th, the People's Liberation Army repelled the three-pronged attack of more than 1,000 Jiang troops of the 58th Division, killing and wounding more than 70 of them. The remaining enemy troops, unable to withstand the attack, collapsed and retreated.

Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 13th: Jiang Yujun, a militiaman from the Yishan District of Guanyun County, repelled 800 enemies with two shots. On March 26th, two battalions, more than 700 men, of the 44th Division of the Jiang army stationed in Dayi Mountain, carrying more than 40 machine guns and small cannons, launched a three-pronged attack on the Yishan District, only to find it empty. The next day, the engineer battalion of the same division stationed in Zhangdian also dispatched two detachments to assist in the battle. The militia of the district immediately avoided the frontal attack and moved to the rear of the enemy to fight an entangling battle. Militiaman Jiang Yujun killed Guo Shenggao, the enemy instructor who was directing the attack, with one shot, and the second shot hit one of the legs of the enemy's 65 machine gun. Seeing the situation was not good, the enemy immediately fled. The militia took advantage of the situation to pursue, killing and wounding another five enemy soldiers each, and seizing more than 150 rounds of ammunition.
