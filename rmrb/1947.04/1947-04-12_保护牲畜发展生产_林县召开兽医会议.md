    Lin County Holds Veterinary Meeting
    [Our Dispatch] In order to protect livestock and develop production, the Lin County Construction Section convened a county-wide veterinary meeting on March 19th. A total of 67 people attended, including veterinarians, livestock breeders, and pig-raising experts. The meeting lasted for six days, discussing prevention and treatment methods for swine fever, as well as livestock breeding issues. Everyone was very enthusiastic during the discussions. Cui Buchao from Shangzhuang said: "I brought with me a small book on treating diseases passed down from my family, and many doctors have contributed various effective remedies." The Construction Section has compiled all the experienced and effective remedies into a booklet, printed and distributed to doctors as a reference for treating diseases, and stipulated that doctors holding "Doctor's Licenses" will not be required to perform corvée labor in the villages for providing medical services to frontline soldiers. Livestock breeders will also be exempt from corvée labor from Qingming to Shuangjiang, and there are also plans to greatly expand the number of livestock breeders. (Han San)
