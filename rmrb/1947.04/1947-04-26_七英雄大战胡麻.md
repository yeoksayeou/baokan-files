The Great Huma Village in the west of Zhaocheng Road is located between Zhaocheng and Hongdong, fifteen miles from each city, like a sharp sword piercing the joint communication and supply line of the Chiang Kai-shek troops in Hongdong and Zhaocheng – the Tongpu Railway Line. During the eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan and the two years of the Patriotic Self-Defense War, many combat heroes emerged here. The most outstanding were Wang Qitong and Dong Dexi from Gao Huida's combat team, along with Chen Wenjie, Gao Linli, Gao Qili, Da Hongzhuan (Big Red Brick), and Xiao Hongzhuan (Little Red Brick), etc., a total of seven people. They were tenacious and brave, repeatedly defeating the Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan troops, and protecting the village. People often call this village "Little Moscow" and these meritorious people's servants as the "Seven Heroes."

Chiang Kai-shek's army has tried more than once to restore his communication and supply line, attempting to crush this "Little Moscow." On March 29th, the stubborn Yan Xishan troops from Hongdong and Zhaocheng concentrated seven companies of more than 800 regular troops and advanced towards Great Huma in two directions.

The loyal and devoted Seven Heroes received intelligence and ambushed themselves on the kiln tops west of the village, using broken bricks and tiles to build simple fortifications, waiting for the enemy. They had only one goal: "to repel the enemy and protect the people."

After breakfast, the stubborn Yan Xishan troops launched an attack with five companies. First, one company occupied Xiajiluo Village below and advanced towards Great Huma along the ditch. When they entered the tile kiln, only 200 meters from the Seven Heroes' position, the heroes aimed at the intermittently appearing enemies and fired volleys. The enemies rolled down and then charged from the north side of the tile kiln. The Seven Heroes still fired volleys, and the enemies dared not move forward any further.

Then, two companies of enemies from the north approached from the east and west of Qinjia Village, with enemy strength exceeding ours by a hundred times. The Seven Heroes fired a few shots vigilantly, stopping the enemy's advance, and cleverly transferred their position to another kiln top to monitor the enemy.

Machine gun fire came from the south. Two companies of enemies from Hongdong occupied the Erlang Temple opposite the ditch. Some of the stubborn soldiers bent over, carrying guns, charging like a pack of dogs. The Seven Heroes fired the bullets that had been pressed into the chamber continuously, and the enemy's several charges were repelled. They retreated into the temple, no longer daring to show their heads. Seeing that the terrain was unfavorable, the heroes immediately transferred to a certain independent building. The seven people divided the work, two people monitored the north, two people monitored the west, and three people monitored the enemy at Erlang Temple in the south. At this time, more than 800 enemies from the north, south, and west sneaked into the village with trepidation, but never dared to approach the Seven Heroes' position, only consuming bullets within an arc 300 meters away.

At this time, the masses in the village, under the cover of the militia, had completely moved to the ditch east of the village, and the militia then moved to the poplar forest east of the village to lie in ambush.

The enemy fully believed they had won a victory. The Second Battalion Commander of the 216th Regiment stood on the kiln top, gesturing and directing the soldiers to loot. The masses whispered to the militia to kill the bastards with cold shots. A sharpshooter aimed at the head of the enemy battalion commander, and a bullet sent him to his death. The enemies grabbed the corpse and jumped off the kiln top in panic, shouting, "Are these militiamen or regular troops?"

The battle continued until lunchtime. Zhang Qikui, a combat hero from the east of the road, arrived with more than 40 members of the Gao Huida Revenge Team to reinforce and made contact with the Seven Heroes. Seeing the reinforcements of the militia, the thousands of masses were even more encouraged. Taking advantage of the enemy's unpreparedness, machine guns, grenades, and grenade launchers were fired at the village, and thousands of masses shouted in unison, "Charge! Capture them alive! Surrender your weapons and you will not be harmed!" They swarmed into the village. At this time, more than 800 enemies in the village were baffled, carrying their flags, abandoning their corpses, and fleeing in a panic. Our heroes tracked them down, attacking the enemy's rear, and chased them all the way to Sixia Bridge. In this battle, a total of sixteen enemies, including the Second Battalion Commander of the 23rd Regiment of the 72nd Division, were killed or wounded. We suffered no casualties.

　　七英雄大战胡麻
    赵城路西大胡麻村位于赵城、洪洞之间，距两城各十五里，好像一把利剑刺向洪赵蒋军联络补给线——同蒲路线。这里在八年抗战与两年的爱国自卫战争中出现了好多战斗英雄，最出色的是高辉达战斗队的王启通、董得喜，陈文杰、高林立、高栖立、大红砖、小红砖等七人，他们顽强勇敢，屡败蒋阎军，保卫了村庄。人们常称该村为“小莫斯科”，称这些人民功臣为“七英雄”。
    蒋军为恢复他的联络补给线，企图摧垮这“小莫斯科”，已不是一次了。三月二十九日，洪洞、赵城阎顽又集中七个连八百余人的正规部队，分两路向大胡麻进犯。
    忠心赤胆的七英雄得到情报，就埋伏在村西窑顶上，用破碎的砖瓦构筑了简单的工事，等待着敌人，他们只有一条心，就是“把敌人打退，保卫住人民”。
    早饭后，阎顽以五个连的兵力出动了。首先以一个连占领了下面的下纪落村，沿着沟向大胡麻前进。进入距七英雄阵地仅二百米的瓦窑上，英雄们瞄准了忽隐忽现的敌人打排子枪，敌人滚下去，又从瓦窑北面冲来。七英雄仍是一阵排枪射去，敌人再也不敢前进一步。
    接着北面敌人两个连从秦家庄东西两条大路逼来，敌之兵力已超过我一百倍。七英雄机警的打了几枪，停止了敌人的前进，灵活转移阵地到另一个窑顶上监视敌人。
    南面的机枪射过来，洪洞之敌两个连占领了隔沟对面的二郎庙，一部顽军弯着腰，提着枪，像一群狗似的冲过来。七英雄把早已压在膛里的子弹连续不断的射去，敌人数次冲锋都被打退了，钻入庙内再不敢露头。英雄们见到地形不利，马上又转移到某家独立楼房，七个人分了工，两个人监视北面，两个人监视西面，三个人监视南面二郎庙之敌。这时南北西三面之敌八百余人提心吊胆摸进了村内，但始终未敢接近七英雄的阵地，只是在三百米外的弧形圈内消耗子弹。
    此时村里的群众在民兵掩护下都完全转移到村东沟里，民兵又随着转移到村东的杨树林埋伏起来。
    敌人满以为得到了胜利，二一六团二营营长立在窑顶上指手划脚的指挥着士兵抢劫，群众低声叫民兵用冷枪打死狗日的，神枪手瞄准了敌人营长的脑袋，一颗子弹，送掉了他的狗命。敌人抓着尸首惊惶的跳下窑顶，叫喊着：“这倒底是民兵是正规军？”
    战斗继续到午饭，路东战斗英雄张七奎带着高辉达复仇队四十余人增援，和七英雄取得了联系。千余群众见到增援民兵，情绪更为鼓舞，乘敌不备，机步枪、手榴弹、掷弹筒一齐向村内射击，千余群众齐声呐喊“冲呀、抓活的、缴枪不伤命”，蜂拥冲入村内，这时村内八百余敌人莫明其妙，背着彩号，丢掉尸首狼狈逃窜，我英雄跟踪追击，打敌屁股，一直追到四夏桥。这次战斗共毙伤敌七二师二三团二营营长以下十六名，我无伤亡。（太岳通讯）
