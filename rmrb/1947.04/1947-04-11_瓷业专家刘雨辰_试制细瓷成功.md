　　Porcelain Expert Liu Yuchen
    Successfully Trials Fine Porcelain
    [Our Newspaper] Porcelain expert Mr. Liu Yuchen (Deputy Director of the Construction Department of the Border Region Government) has been improving the porcelain industry in Pengcheng Town, a famous porcelain-producing area in North China, and has been approaching fine porcelain production. In December, he discovered a type of stone (a type of dry soil on the coal seam) in the stove ash of Changzhi, which, after being fired, was white, shiny, and extremely hard. He carefully studied it and, in combination with other raw materials, experimented in a certain place. Now, more than a hundred types of experimental products have been produced from the kiln, all of which are extremely fine and can be compared with the fine porcelain of Jiangxi. This type of raw material is extremely abundant in the Shangdang area, and mass production is now beginning. (Guang Ju)
