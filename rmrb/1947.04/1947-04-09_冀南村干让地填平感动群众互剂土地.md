Chen Yangan and Xu Yun of Ganguantun Village, after persuasion, voluntarily gave up the land they had contracted for compensation. Tian Yuanqing, the director of the Farmers' Association of Wuqi No. 1 Village in En County, used the five mu of land he had over-allocated to compensate a middle peasant who had been wrongly struggled against. Village head Tian Zeqing allocated the four mu of land he had over-allocated to poor peasants who had not yet been leveled, gaining the praise and support of the masses in the village.
