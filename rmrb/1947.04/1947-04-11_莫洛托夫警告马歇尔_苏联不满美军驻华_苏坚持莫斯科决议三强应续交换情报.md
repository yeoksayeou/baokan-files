　　Molotov Warns Marshall
    Soviet Union Dissatisfied with US Troops Stationed in China
    USSR Insists on Continued Intelligence Exchange Among Three Powers as per Moscow Decision
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, April 9th: It is reported that TASS published on the 7th summaries of the exchanges between Molotov and Marshall regarding the China issue. Molotov's letter to Marshall stated briefly: The Soviet Union expresses dissatisfaction with the continued stationing of US troops in China, and the Soviet Union is extremely concerned about the United States' interference in China's internal affairs. Molotov warned Marshall that foreign interference in China's internal affairs, especially the participation of foreign armed forces in the civil war, would only expand the civil war and make China's democratic unification even more difficult. The Soviet government supports a policy of non-interference in China's internal affairs. If the United States does not disregard the agreement on non-interference in China's internal affairs, the part of the Moscow Agreement concerning China can be fulfilled. It also stated that Soviet troops had withdrawn from China on May 4th of last year, and expressed considerable doubt about when US troops would withdraw from China. Finally, Mr. Molotov requested that the three powers participating in the part of the Moscow Agreement concerning China continue to exchange intelligence, because the current US performance regarding the implementation of this resolution is unsatisfactory, which has raised general doubts about the sincerity of the three powers in fulfilling their promises.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, April 9th: Chenggong Lake News: Soviet representative Gromyko recently severely criticized the Truman Doctrine of aid to Greece and Turkey in the United Nations Security Council. Mr. Gromyko pointed out: The United States' unilateral action, focusing on military aid, is no longer a general so-called "aid," but actually constitutes interference in the internal affairs of two strategically important countries in the eastern Mediterranean. If such interference is allowed to continue, it will inevitably lead to the continued expansion of the Greek civil war. Mr. Truman's bill clearly has a political effect and will hinder the development of friendly relations between countries and seriously undermine the United Nations. Mr. Gromyko argued that even if Greece is truly threatened, aid should only be provided by the United Nations after the United Nations Investigation Committee submits a report. Regarding the issue of aid to Turkey, Mr. Gromyko stated that Turkey assisted Hitler's Germany during the war and there is no reason to provide it with aid.

　　莫洛托夫警告马歇尔
    苏联不满美军驻华
    苏坚持莫斯科决议三强应续交换情报
    【新华社陕北九日电】据悉：塔斯社七日发表莫洛托夫与马歇尔交换关于中国问题之摘要，莫洛托夫致马歇尔之函，略称：苏联对于美军之仍驻于中国表示不满，苏联对美国之干涉中国内政极为关切。莫洛托夫警告马歇尔称：外国干涉中国内政，尤其外国武装部队参与内战一端，徒然扩大内战，使中国之民主统一更见困难。苏联政府支持不干涉中国内政政策，如美国不忽略不干涉中国内政事务之协议，则莫斯科协定中关于中国之部分定可履行。又称：苏军已于去年五月四日退出中国，而对美军退出中国之时日颇表怀疑。最后，莫氏要求参加莫斯科协定中关于中国部分之三强继续交换情报，因目前美国对该决议之履行情形不能令人满意，因而引起一般对三强履行诺言之诚意发生怀疑。
    【新华社陕北九日电】成功湖讯：苏联代表葛罗米柯日前在联合国安理会上严厉指斥了杜鲁门援助希土法案。葛氏指出：美国之单独行动，着重军事援助，已非一般所谓“援助”，实际上形成对东地中海两个地势重要国家内政之干涉。此种干涉如任其继续，势将导引希腊内战之继续扩大。杜氏此一法案显系有政治作用，且将阻碍各国间友好关系之发展，并严重损害联合国。葛氏主张即使希腊真正遭受威胁，只应待联合国调查委员会提出报告后，再由联合国予以援助。关于援助土耳其问题，葛氏称：土耳其于战时曾协助希特勒德国，实无予以援助之理由。
