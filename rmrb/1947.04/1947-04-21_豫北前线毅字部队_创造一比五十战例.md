Frontline Yubei Yi Character Unit
Creates 1:50 Battle Example
[This newspaper's Yubei Frontline 19th dispatch] The People's Liberation Army Yi Character Unit on the Yubei Frontline created a brilliant 1:50 battle example at the foot of Baiqi Mountain. The details are as follows: Jiang's 41st Division, 124th Brigade, in order to coordinate with the Jiang army's northward advance on the Pinghan Railway, attacked Baiqi Village at the foot of Baiqi Mountain on the 11th. The village was defended by two battalions of our Yi Character Unit. At dawn that day, the Jiang army, with a force of a thousand men, attacked our 2nd Company's position in two routes. When the Jiang army advanced to 400 meters from our position, they immediately lay down and dared not advance, instead bombarding our position with intense artillery fire. The defending soldiers calmly resisted. Comrade Zhang Shuangkou, the machine gun squad leader of the company, used single shots from his machine gun to completely knock down 28 advancing Jiang soldiers. Combat hero Li Zhisan shot and killed three Jiang soldiers with three shots. Quartermaster Yang Dushan, who had only recently joined the army, ran to the fortifications after finishing the cooking and knocked down two Jiang soldiers in a row. The enemy was repelled for the first time. Two hours later, they gathered more than a thousand men, crossed the mountain stream, and launched a second attack from the northeast corner of the village. Another company of our troops, defending the position in the village, immediately launched a counter-attack against the enemy. Liberation soldier Zhang Hongkui sang songs of defending Chairman Mao while firing his gun. Our artillery on the mountain also fired simultaneously, bombarding the enemy. Artilleryman Yao Shanhai blasted four Jiang soldiers "flying" with one shell, driving the enemy back to the mountain stream within ten minutes. By 11:00 AM, they left behind more than twenty corpses and loaded four large carts, fleeing in a panic. According to a captured Jiang army platoon leader on the spot, the Jiang army suffered at least a hundred casualties in the attack on Baiqi Village. And the Jiang army's five hundred shells only wounded two of our soldiers. (Yong Guang)
