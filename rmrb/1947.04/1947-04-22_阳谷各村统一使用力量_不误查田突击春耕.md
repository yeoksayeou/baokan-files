    Yanggu Villages Unify Labor Power
    Ensure Timely Spring Ploughing and Thorough Land Investigation
    [This paper's dispatch] After the Second District of Yanggu proposed spring ploughing, the Li Village still had some floating wealth that had not been distributed. In order to distribute the wealth without delaying spring ploughing, a meeting of all villagers was convened on the morning of the 2nd of this month to discuss solutions. At the meeting, it was decided that spring ploughing would take place during the day, and the wealth would be distributed at night. Specific regulations were also made on how to carry out spring ploughing: First, all the village's livestock would participate in spring ploughing. In order to complete the spring ploughing task, all of the village's spring land would be cultivated jointly, first for the military families and households without labor. During the period of intensive work, the livestock would not be used for private work. Most of the village's spring land has now been harrowed once. Second, women should take more care of household chores during the spring ploughing rush, such as carrying water, weeding, and feeding cattle, and also seize the time to spin and weave. Third, the able-bodied adults should go to the fields to produce during the day, the elderly should be on guard during the day, and those who strike the night watch should work overtime. Cadres should lead shifts to check on the night watch. In the Fifth District, the land and wealth investigation in Wujiangtai has not yet ended, and the distribution of wealth is under discussion. The masses have automatically proposed methods for hauling manure: First, military families and those without labor should be cared for in groups according to the strength of manpower and animal power of the farmers' association groups. Second, manure should be hauled for military families first, then for poor peasants, and then for middle peasants and well-to-do middle peasants. The task of hauling manure for the entire village was completed in three days. The masses said, "Mutual aid is still good," and their morale is high. In the Fifth District, Yang Jin conducted mutual aid education for production during the land and wealth investigation. There were thirty military families in the entire village with very few cattle. If mutual aid was not organized, it would become a major problem. After discussion, a consensus was reached to organize mutual aid. A total of nine groups were organized. Livestock and carts were uniformly allocated, with two carts and five to six cattle per group. The elderly were also assigned to each group to do odd jobs (hauling manure, feeding cattle, etc.). Land was allocated according to the productivity of each group. Military families were cared for by the groups, and work was done for military families first. The morale of the masses is high, and they are now ploughing the land and hauling manure. The method is to work during the day and hold meetings in the evening to discuss what to do tomorrow.

    阳谷各村统一使用力量
    不误查田突击春耕
    【本报讯】阳谷二区提出春耕以后，李庄还有一部浮财没有分完，为了分财不耽误春耕，于本月二号早晨召集了全村群众开会商量解决办法，在大会上通过了白天春耕，晚上分财。并具体规定了如何进行春耕：一、全庄牲口一律参加春耕，为了突击完成春耕任务，全庄春地共同耕种，先给军属及无劳力户耕，在突击期内牲口不干私活。现已把全庄春地大部耙了一遍。二、妇女在春耕突击中，要多照顾家中杂活，担水、锄草、喂牛等，并抓紧纺花织布。三、壮年白天下地生产，老年人白天站岗，晚上打更的加班，干部带班查更。五区武将台查田查财未结束，正在讨论分财，群众自动提出拉粪办法：一、把军属和无劳力者，按农会小组的人力和牛力的强弱，分组照顾。二、先拉军属的粪，次拉贫农的粪，然后拉中农、富裕中农，三天的功夫全村拉粪任务完成。群众说：“还是互助好”，情绪很高。五区杨晋在查田查财中进行生产互助教育，全村有三十家军属，牛很少，如不组织互助就成了大问题，经讨论一致意见组织互助。共组织了九个组，牲口大车统一分配，每组大车两辆，牛五头至六头，老头也编到各组去，让他们做零星活（拉粪喂牛等）。地亩按每组生产力分配，军属分组照顾，先做军属的活，群众情绪很高，现正耕地、拉粪。白天做法，晚上开会讨论明天做啥活。（阳谷人民小报）
