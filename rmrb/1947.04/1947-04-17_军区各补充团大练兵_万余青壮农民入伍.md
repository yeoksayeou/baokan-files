The Military Region's Supplementary Regiments Conduct Large-Scale Military Training
Over Ten Thousand Young and Strong Farmers Enlist

[Reported by this newspaper] Over ten thousand farmers from this region who enlisted in the army have been organized into five supplementary regiments. They successively held grand establishment meetings and enlistment ceremonies at the end of last month. At the meetings, representatives of the new recruits spoke, unanimously expressing their determination not to return home until Chiang Kai-shek was defeated. Following this, a week of self-motivated, bottom-up mass line-based grievance-airing and self-reflection education took place. Consequently, challenges and responses were issued between battalions, companies, platoons, squads, and individuals, establishing agreements and plans for meritorious service. Regarding the new soldiers' concerns about their families, solutions were discussed and resolved collectively by the soldiers themselves.慰问 letters and explanations from district and village administrations and families of soldiers played a significant role in strengthening the new soldiers' determination to join the army and boosting their morale. In particular, Comrade Suo Mingfu, a district cadre from the Ninth District of Ci County, went deep into various squads with the troops, addressing soldiers' problems on the spot when possible and writing letters to village cadres for solutions when necessary, which greatly encouraged the new soldiers. Gao Fuzhi from the Eighth Company of Supplementary Regiment Three received a letter from home saying, "Our house has been replaced with a better one, the land is being cultivated by others, and the preferential treatment for military families in the village is excellent. Don't come back. Returning would not only let down the village cadres but also your relatives and us." Soldier Zhao Yongwang received a letter from his older brother urging him to return home for marriage. He said, "I cannot return. It is crucial to practice martial arts and fight Chiang Kai-shek. Marrying a wife is easy, but she might hold me back." A soldier from Xincheng, Shahe, deserted at night and ran home. His parents and wife were surprised to see him and asked, "Why did you come back? It's shameful. The village is treating us well!" Under the persuasion of his family, he returned to the team that night. Another soldier who ran home found the village cadres leading the masses to repair his house. Upon seeing him return, they immediately stopped working and sent him back to his original team. He was very regretful and ashamed. Many soldiers practiced martial arts despite being ill, fearing falling behind. Life in the regiments was very active, with constant singing and harmonious relationships. The new soldiers felt the warmth of a revolutionary family. Some cadres saved eggs for the sick, and squad leaders Jing Yugen from Supplementary Regiment One and Zhao Zilong from Supplementary Regiment Three fetched water for soldiers, packed backpacks, fed medicine to the sick, poured bedpans, and helped them to the toilet. The sick soldiers were moved, saying, "Being in the Eighth Route Army is better than being at home. Even close brothers wouldn't do this. Once I recover, I will intensify my studies and go to the front line to fight Chiang Kai-shek." In summary, the over ten thousand new soldiers in the supplementary regiments have only one goal: to intensify their hard training in skills, prepare to join the main forces, defeat Chiang Kai-shek, achieve meritorious service for the people, eradicate poverty, and live a good life.

[Reported by this newspaper] The Military Region's Supplementary Third Regiment held a grand enlistment ceremony at its station on the first of this month. One thousand five hundred outstanding young people officially joined the People's Liberation Army. The regiment's leaders, Ren, Liang, and Zi, called on all new soldiers not only to be heroes in joining the army but also to be models of learning, heroes in fighting and killing the enemy, and glorious warriors under the command of the ever-victorious General Liu Bocheng. They were urged to resolutely obey the orders of superiors and abide by discipline. Over twenty models who had emerged during the enlistment and after joining the army were commended, such as Suo Qinghua and Suo Sishun from the Eighth Company, who voluntarily signed up to join the army. Under their influence, ninety-three people joined the army. Comrade Zhou Qiguo voluntarily enlisted, influencing sixty-three people to join him on the front lines. Comrade Zhang Genwei from the Sixth Company voluntarily signed up as soon as he heard the news of the expansion. He was afraid his family would hold him back, so he didn't tell them. His father, fearing that his son wouldn't join the army, asked others to intercede. After others communicated with his father and son, Zhang happily told people, "Last year, we defeated the little Chiang Kai-shek, and now the big Chiang Kai-shek is here. I am an activist in the village and have also received land. If we don't defeat Chiang Kai-shek, I swear not to return home." He is now a deputy platoon leader and works very actively. Squad leader Liu Jinguang from the Second Company recognized that deserting was the most disgraceful thing and said, "One desertion means one less force to fight Chiang Kai-shek." Some comrades in his squad considered deserting, but he helped and educated them, saving them. Therefore, the regiment leaders awarded his squad a merit. Fang Youxiang and Han Qiren from the Eighth Company were diligent in sentry duty and captured two fugitive soldiers, explaining to them that deserting was disgraceful. In addition to public commendation, Fang and Han were each awarded a merit. Following this, District Cadre Suo Mingfu spoke, saying, "We all joined the army to live a good life and to defeat Chiang Kai-shek as soon as possible. This is glorious. Since it is glorious, we must be glorious to the end, not just half-glorious. Our local staff must resolutely ensure that the families of soldiers face no difficulties." Wang Erling, the family member of a soldier, said, "It is glorious that my brother joined the army, and I am also very honored. He is fighting the big Chiang Kai-shek at the front, and I am fighting the small Chiang Kai-shek in the rear. I must work hard in production and not rely on government assistance."

　　军区各补充团大练兵
    万余青壮农民入伍
    【本报讯】本区参军农民一部万余人，经编成五个补充团，于上月底先后开成立大会，举行入伍仪式。在大会上，新兵代表讲话，一致表示不打败蒋介石誓不回家。接着经过一周间自发的自下而上群众路线的诉苦反省教育，于是营与营、连与连、班排、个人挑战或应战，订出公约和立功计划。对新战士念家问题，是经战士们大家商讨办法解决的。区村政权及军属不断来信慰问和解释，对新战士参军意志的坚定，情绪的提高，作用很大。特别磁县九区区干索明福同志跟随部队深入各班，对战士的问题能解决的当面解决，不能解决的写信叫村干来解决，这都给新战士极大的鼓舞。补三团八连高福之家里来信说：“咱们的房子换成好的了，地有人代耕了，村中优抗做的很好，你可别回来，回来不独对不起村干，也对不起亲友和我们”。战士赵永旺他哥哥来信叫他回家结婚，他说：“我可不回去，练武打老蒋要紧，娶媳妇子容易被她拉着腿”。沙河新城一个战士夜间开小差跑回家去，他父母妻子见了惊奇的问：“你怎么回来了？真丢人，村里正优待咱呢！”在家人劝说之下，连夜归队。还有一个战士跑回家时，正值村干带着群众给他家修房子，一见他跑回去，马上停了工，并把他送回原队，他很后悔惭愧。许多战士抱病习武，生恐落于人后。各团生活很活跃，歌声不断，感情融洽，新战士体会到革命家庭的温暖。有些干部省下鸡蛋给病号吃，补一团班长荆玉根、补三团班长赵子龙给战士打水，捆背包，给病号喂药，倒尿盆，扶着入厕所，病号感动的说：“当八路军比在家还好，亲兄弟也不能这样，病好了加紧学习，上前线打老蒋”。总之，补充团万余新战士只有一个目标，就是加紧苦练技术，准备参加主力军，打倒老蒋为人民立功，拔除穷根，再过好时光。（王文治）
    【本报讯】军区补充第三团于本月一日在驻地举行隆重的入伍典礼，一千五百优秀青年正式参加了人民解放军。该团任、梁、子诸首长号召全体新战士不但要做参军英雄，而且要做学习模范、战斗杀敌英雄，做光荣的常胜将军刘伯承部下的战士，要坚决的服从上级的命令、遵守纪律。并表扬了参军中及到部队后的二十余位模范，如：八连索清华、索四顺二同志自动报名参军，在他俩的影响下有九十三人参了军。周其国同志，自动参军，影响了六十三人要跟他一齐上前线。六连张根伟同志，听到扩军的消息就自动报了名，他怕家中拉后腿没告诉家，他父亲怕他儿子不参军就让别人去活动，经别人谈通了他父子的心事，张同志就高兴的对人说：“去年打垮了小老蒋，现在来了大老蒋，咱在村上是积极分子，又分得了果实，如果不打垮老蒋，我誓死不回家。”现在他是副排长，工作很积极。二连刘金光班长，他认识开小差最不光荣，并说：“开一个小差就少一份打老蒋的力量。”在他班有同志想开小差，在他的帮助教育下挽救了他们，因此团首长特给该班记功一次。八连房有祥、韩起仁二同志放哨认真，捉住了两个逃亡战士，并能向他们解释开小差不光荣；房、韩二同志除通报表扬外，各记功一次。继由区干部索明福同志讲话，他说：“我们大家为了过好时光，为了早日打败蒋介石而参了军，这是光荣的。既是光荣，我们就要光荣到底，不要只光荣半截。我们地方工作人员要坚决保证抗属没有任何困难。”抗属王二龄说：“我兄弟参军是光荣的，就是我也很光荣；他在前方打大老蒋，我在后方打小老蒋，更要好好生产，不依靠政府的照顾。”
