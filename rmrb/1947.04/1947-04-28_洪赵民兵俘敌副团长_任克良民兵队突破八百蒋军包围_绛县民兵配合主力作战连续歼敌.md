　　Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 25th -- The militia in a certain district of Hongdong and Zhaocheng recently captured Liu Huanzhang, the deputy commander of the 210th Regiment of the Yan Xishan's army, and killed or captured 56 enemy soldiers including camp commanders and platoon leaders, in over twenty days. The Gao Huida militia team is particularly noted for its battle achievements. In mid-March, nine militiamen from this team attacked the Second Battalion of the 206th Regiment of the Yan Xishan's army, which was attacking Huma Village. The militia sharpshooter Dong Baochang killed the Fourth Company commander of the Yan army with a single shot. The Yan army charged several times under the cover of machine guns, but were repelled. Finally, they were defeated by militia reinforcements from various villages, and pursued for a distance of one li, with a total of 16 enemy soldiers killed or wounded. On the 26th of last month, the Yan army again attacked the village with five companies in three routes. Seven militiamen from the Gao Huida team resisted for an hour, and the sharpshooter Dong Baochang again killed their battalion commander with a single shot. The militia and masses from nearby villages came to help in the battle, shouting "Take back our things!", their battle cries deafening. They closely followed the militia in pursuit of the routed enemy, killing or wounding a total of 19 enemy soldiers.

　　Taiyue, 25th -- Ren Keliang, a famous hero on the Emei Ridge in Southern Shanxi, led his militia to bravely break through the "encirclement and suppression" of eight hundred Chiang Kai-shek soldiers. On the 3rd of this month, Ren Keliang led his militia to cooperate with the Anxian Independent Battalion. They had just arrived at Wang Village when they were discovered by the enemy, who dispatched ten companies of the "Love the Homeland Corps," totaling more than eight hundred men, to suddenly encircle Wang Village. At that time, Ren Keliang immediately led the militia to fight back, and the battle was extremely fierce. Ren Keliang's younger brother, Ren Si, and the militiaman Jin Yuanwen, gloriously sacrificed themselves in the battle. The militia were filled with grief and indignation, and their fighting spirit grew stronger. They finally repelled the enemy, and pursued them directly to Dongwang Village, killing or capturing twelve enemy soldiers. The fleeing enemy told the soldiers, "The intelligence was wrong. This must be the Eighth Route Army's field brigade." After the death of Ren Keliang's younger brother and another person, the Ren Keliang militia immediately launched a surge of revenge for the dead. On the morning of the 5th, the Ren Keliang militia team, in cooperation with a unit of the Independent Battalion, operated along the railway line. When they arrived at Yang Village, they encountered more than 30 Chiang Kai-shek diehards, capturing six enemy soldiers, seizing one machine gun, seven rifles, and one bicycle. We suffered no casualties in this battle.

　　News from our newspaper: The Jiang County militia cooperated with the troops to continuously annihilate the enemy and win victories, seizing two light machine guns and five rifles, capturing fifteen Yan Xishan stubborn soldiers alive, and killing or wounding four. Zhang Fei's unit of the Fifth Regiment of the Yan stubborns, totaling more than 60 men, (remnants fleeing from Yicheng) were suffering devastating blows from our army and civilians everywhere. At 10:00 a.m. on April 6, they fled from Nan Shu Temple (Quwo) to Bei Shu Temple. When the militia in our Nanwan Town, Third District, discovered this, they immediately cooperated with a squad of our Eighth Route Army to pursue them. At the northwest corner of Bei Shu Temple, several of our militiamen went to pursue in the northwest direction, while another group, led by Comrade Zhang Wenjun of our Third District Armed Forces Committee, went to pursue in the northeast direction, capturing seven stubborn soldiers alive and seizing four rifles. Besides consuming more than ten bullets, this victory did not incur any losses or costs. Another unit of our army (including militia) pursuing in the northwest direction captured three enemy soldiers alive, seized one machine gun, one rifle, and more than one hundred bullets. In addition, Comrade Liu Zihou, the district head of our Third District, led the militia to Po Tou, Dong Zhou (ten li north of Nan Wan, belonging to Quwo) at two o'clock on the same day to pursue the enemy, capturing four alive, seizing one light machine gun, and more than ten bullets.

　　Additional news: At 10:00 a.m. on April 7, more than 20 militiamen from our Second District of Jiang County, led by District Chief Qiao, once captured Hengshui Town.
