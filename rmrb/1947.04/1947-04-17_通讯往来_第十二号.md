　　Communication and Exchange
　　No. 12

　　To all correspondents in various regions:

　　Spring plowing has already begun, and at the same time, we are in an unprecedentedly tense period of thoroughly eliminating feudalism and engaging in the patriotic self-defense war. It is hoped that you will vigorously report on the detailed situations, methods, and experiences of combining mass movements, spring plowing, and participation in the war. In order to make the reporting timely and in-depth, it is hoped that correspondents and special correspondents who directly participate in the above-mentioned work will seize one or two villages or one district to create concrete experiences and make continuous reports.
