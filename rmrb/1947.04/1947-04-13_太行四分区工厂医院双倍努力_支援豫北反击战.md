　　Taihang Fourth Military Sub-district Factories and Hospitals Double Efforts
    to Support the Yubei Counter-offensive
    [Our Taihang News] Just as the frontline troops in Yubei are launching fierce counter-attacks against the Chiang troops who have invaded Yubei, the rear factories and hospitals of the Taihang Fourth Military Sub-district are doubling their efforts to support the front lines. The sub-district's clothing factory unanimously formulated a production plan and challenged the military region and other sub-district clothing factories. Each machine produced an average of 18 and a half sets of military uniforms per day. The dyeing group exceeded its task by one-sixth in ten days. Recently, everyone voluntarily requested an extra hour of work per day (totaling eleven hours). After working all day, they all bought pens and paper and studied around the table at night. The sub-district's bomb factory's output in February has already more than doubled. The carpentry group and the finishing group both voluntarily worked overtime until 10 o'clock in the evening, and got up early the next day to continue working. Comrades Bao Yuquan and Wang Mingliang of the foundry group used a windmill to fan the fire, which melted ten more cans of iron than using bellows in the past, increasing the number of shell casings by 30%. The repair shop also voluntarily reduced its workforce by two-tenths without delaying work. Comrade Xin Laiyuan, a carpenter, is actively researching a foot-operated hand grenade handle turning machine. After successful mastery, it can be faster than the hand-pulled grenade handle turning machine by one-third. In the hospitals, in addition to some comrades setting up first-aid stations on the road of more than one hundred li and participating in frontline rescue, each hospital branch is promoting new therapies. The medical personnel of the Third Hospital proposed to make contributions in promoting new therapies. For example, on March 5th, they received 45 wounded soldiers, most of whom needed surgery, but within ten days, four of them were cured. Only one of all the wounded soldiers had wound suppuration. The cooks constantly went to the wards to solicit opinions on the meals from the wounded and sick, and then studied and discussed how to improve them to be more satisfactory. (Xin Dan)

　　太行四分区工厂医院双倍努力
    支援豫北反击战
    【本报太行讯】正当豫北前线部队向侵占豫北的蒋军进行猛烈的反击战时，太行四分区的后方工厂医院以双倍的努力，支援前线。分区被服厂，一致订出生产计划，向军区及各分区被服厂提出挑战，他们每架机子平均每日制出十八套半军衣；染工组十天中超过任务六分之一，最近大家自动要求每日加工一小时（共为十一小时），白天工作一天，晚上都自己买笔买纸围着桌子学习。分区炸弹所二月份的产量已超过一倍，木工组、完成组都自动加工到夜晚十点钟，第二天很早就起床继续工作，翻砂组暴玉泉、王明亮两同志，改用风车扇火，比过去风箱扇火多化铁十罐，增加弹壳百分之三十。修械组也自动减少人数十分之二，仍不误工。木工辛来元同志正积极研究脚踏旋手榴弹柄机，成功熟练后，比手拉旋弹柄机可快三分之一。医院中除一部分同志在一百余里的道路上分设救护站，并参加火线救护，各医院分所都推行新疗法。三所的医务人员提出在推行新疗法中立功，比如他们在三月五日接受了四十五个伤员，其中大部分伤员需要动手术，但在十天内就治愈了四人，全部伤员中只有一人伤口化脓；炊事员同志不断到伤病员房内去征求对饭菜的意见，回来后即研究讨论，如何改得更满意。（辛丹）
