    Military Region Hygiene Materials Factory
    Invents New Method for Refining Mirabilite
    [Our News] The Military Region Hygiene Materials Factory has invented a new method for refining mirabilite. The old method was to dissolve crude mirabilite in hot water, filter it, and then heat and evaporate it, which took a long time and consumed more fuel. After the launch of the merit campaign in March, Comrade Li Shuanghe, the leader of the sixth group, used the principle of rapid crystallization of supersaturated solutions. He dissolved crude mirabilite in boiling water to achieve a supersaturated state, then filtered it while hot and cooled it to obtain crystals. This time, the sixth group refined 5,000 jin of mirabilite in only two weeks. This saved half the time and half the labor, and saved more than 10,000 jin of coal (other containing ingredients, because the solubility is smaller than mirabilite, so most of the precipitation settles to the bottom of the jar during crystallization).

    军区卫生材料厂
    发明精制芒硝新法
    【本报讯】军区卫生材料厂发明精制芒硝新办法。过去的办法是将皮硝溶解于热水，过滤、加热蒸发才成，费时较长，消耗燃料更多。在三月份立功运动展开后，六组长李双合同志，利用过饱和溶液迅速结晶的原理，将皮硝溶解于沸水中，使其达到过饱和状态，然后趁热滤过，放冷即得结晶。这次六组精制五千斤芒硝，仅时两周。时间上，节省一倍，人工也节省一倍，并节省一万余斤煤炭（其他含有成份，因溶解度比芒硝小，故结晶时大部分沉淀到缸底）。（李海泉）
