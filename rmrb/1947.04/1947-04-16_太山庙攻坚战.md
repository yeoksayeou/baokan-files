    The Battle of Taishan Temple
    Ke Ren
    At dusk on the third day, a company of the puppet Yan army's 5th Security Regiment, defending Taishan Temple, felt that a great disaster was imminent. In great fear, they set ablaze the ninety civilian houses fifty meters away from Taishan Temple, creating a roaring fire. In our army's trenches, however, there was a joyful busyness. The hearts of the brave soldiers held only one thought: to capture Taishan Temple. Machine gunner Fan Heqing ran to the grenade-throwing team. The team leader welcomed him and said, "Good, come and see if you have any suggestions?" Fan Heqing excitedly said, "The machine gun can provide secure cover for you to charge forward. Look at these gun holes; each one must be sealed off!" This was followed by a chorus of "Good, good!" Liang Qingxiu chimed in, "As long as you shoot accurately, we'll even write an article about you and publish it in the newspaper," followed by another burst of joyful laughter. As darkness fell, everyone became tense. Some were unscrewing grenade caps, some were tying shoelaces, and some were putting on leggings. Fan Heqing took off his cotton coat, wearing only a shirt, and put on a Japanese steel helmet. He exerted himself and muttered, "This will allow me to do a good job, a good job!"
    The mortar gunner fired the first shell, and then all the guns fired together. Under the cover of the smoke screen, the demolition team, wielding shining choppers, charged straight forward, cutting the barbed wire. Fan Heqing raised his machine gun and began firing, bullets dancing on the enemy's gun holes. While building the bridge, a plank fell into the outer moat. Deaf caretaker Wang Shuangyin, with three grenades stuck in his belt, jumped over and said, "Come on!" He quickly went down and told everyone to pass the plank over his shoulders and back. Once the bridge was built, he scrambled up the ladder and rushed into the enemy's stronghold. Under the combined attack of the infantry, artillery, and engineers, the enemy's bunkers and fortifications at Taishan Temple were completely destroyed. The puppet Yan army's 5th Security Regiment in Yicheng County was so frightened that they broke out that night, but they were ultimately annihilated by the brave soldiers who defended Chairman Mao.

　　太山庙攻坚战
    克仁
    三日黄昏，防守太山庙的阎伪军保五团一个连，觉得大祸就要临头，万分恐惧地把离太山庙五十公尺的九十间民房燃起了熊熊的大火。在我军战壕里，却充满愉快的忙碌。勇士们的心只有一条：攻下太山庙。机枪手范合清跑到投弹组跟前，投弹组长欢迎着说：“好，你来看看有什么意见？”范合清兴奋的说：“机枪可以保险掩护你们冲上去。你看这些枪眼，一个一个都要封锁住它！”于是响起了一片“好好”的欢呼。梁清秀插上一句说：“只要你打的准，还为你写个稿子登在报上”，又是一片愉快的笑声。天黑了，大家都紧张起来。有的拧手榴弹盖子，有的挽鞋带子，有的在打着绑腿。范合清把棉衣脱去，光穿着衬衣，头上顶起了日本钢盔，使一使力，自言自语的说：“这就能干得好，干得好！”
    迫击炮手射出了第一颗炮弹，紧接着所有的炮一齐发射。破坏组乘着烟幕，举起寒光闪闪的铡刀直冲过去，截断了铁丝网。范合清端着机枪起来射击，子弹在对方的枪眼上跳着。搭跳板时，有一块板掉在外壕里了，聋子饲养员王双印腰里插着三颗手榴弹跳过去说：“来呀！”迅速下去，叫大家把跳板从他的肩背上接过去。搭好了跳板，他又抢着爬上梯子，冲进敌人的据点。在步炮工兵的联合进攻下，太山庙敌之碉堡工事完全毁灭了。翼城城关的阎伪军保五团吓得当夜就突围，但终被保卫毛主席的勇士消灭了。
