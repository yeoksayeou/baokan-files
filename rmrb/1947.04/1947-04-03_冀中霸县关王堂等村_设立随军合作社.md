Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 31st -- Guanwangtang and Xiachahe villages in Baxian County, Central Hebei Province, recently established "Accompany the Army" cooperatives to regulate the supply of daily necessities for the troops during combat and prevent unscrupulous merchants from taking the opportunity to raise prices. The two cooperatives used 1,000 jin of corn supplied by the Baxian County government and 7,000 jin of corn from the villages as capital. They mainly sell vegetables, oil, salt, soy sauce, and vinegar. In peacetime, they still function as production cooperatives for the two villages. "Accompany the Army" cooperatives in Xinzhuang and Suchang townships of the county are also in preparation.
