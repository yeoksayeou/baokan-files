　　Correspondence
　　(No. 9)
　　To Comrades Guo Jing Tang, Lian Qian Xiang, and Hao Xi Qing on the left: Your manuscript, "Cadres and Masses in Your County Unite to Squeeze Out Feudalism in District One," describes the concrete process of cadres sincerely examining themselves and withdrawing from the fruits [of land reform], and of cadres and masses uniting closely to squeeze out feudalism. The manuscript about Feng Hou Village mobilizing old men to pour out their grievances against landlords and settle accounts is also very typical. Please continue to report on the situation and experience of mobilizing honest peasants to thoroughly eliminate feudal vestiges. It is especially needed to capture the awakening process and facts of a cadre and write about it.
　　To Comrade Liu Village of Lucheng: Your "Experiences of Deepening the Movement in the Fifth District of Lucheng" (this newspaper, March 30) proves that mobilizing the "backward" ideologically and repeatedly reviewing are the keys to eliminating feudal remnants, and it is very vivid and complete. Hope to continue to report on the experience of improving cadre-masses relations.
　　To the Ping Shun Reporting Committee: Please continuously report on your county's handling of the problems left over from the land reform and the gradual integration with production.
　　To the Beiliu Village Correspondence Group of Licheng: The ideas of "taking a rest" and wasting the fruits [of land reform] discovered in Beiliu, Nanbu and other villages are worth reflecting on. The roots of these ideas, the process of solving them, and the final results should be reported.

　　通讯往来  （第九号）
    左边郭靖唐、连千祥、郝喜庆同志：你县一区干群团结挤封建一稿，写出了干部诚恳检讨退出果实，干群亲密团结挤封建的具体过程；峰堠村发动老汉对地主诉苦清算一稿也很典型。请继续报导发动老实农民与彻底清算封建尾巴情形与经验。如能抓住一个干部，写出其觉悟过程与事实，尤为需要。
    潞城柳村同志：你的“潞城五区深入运动的经验”（本报三月三十日），证明从思想上发动“落后”与再三复查是消灭封建残余的关键，很生动、完整。希继续报导改进干群关系的经验。
    平顺报导委员会：请连续报导你县处理土地改革中遗留问题及逐步结合生产情形。
    黎城北流村通讯小组：北流、南堡等村发现“歇一歇”，浪费果实等思想值得反映，应将其根源，解决过程，最后结果报导出来。
