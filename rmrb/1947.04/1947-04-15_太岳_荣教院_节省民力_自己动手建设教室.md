　　Taiyue "Rongjiao Institute" Saves Civilian Labor
    Self-Construction of Classrooms
    [Report from Taiyue, 13th of this month] Since the Taiyue "Rongjiao Institute" launched its merit campaign in early February, all staff members have been carrying grain and coal and constructing four classrooms within two months, transforming the institute into a school and saving 67 civilian laborers. The institute requires 18,000 catties of grain and 47,000 catties of coal annually, which previously required civilian labor. However, since February, all personnel have been doing it themselves. The First and Second Institutes originally didn't have enough staff, but they still took time out each week to carry coal. The retired veteran's homes were also swept up in the merit campaign. In the Second Institute, five blind veterans from the Fifth Class often helped the staff with their work. Gou Fasheng, who only has one arm, and Li Shun, who is disabled in the legs and has difficulty moving, both volunteered to go to the coal mine to carry coal. All 130 disabled comrades in the Second Institute actively and enthusiastically participated in moving bricks, carrying water, carrying earth, and mixing mud, fully demonstrating their high level of political consciousness in serving the people. Comrade Lü Zhongmi, who has lost both arms, could not participate in labor, but volunteered to mobilize the offering tables, benches, and plaques in the nearby villages' temples, ensuring that five or six people would have a table. Duan Yue'ao, Jia Fengjian, Zhao Xizhi, and others who only have one arm, also actively built tables and seats. With everyone's active labor, the First and Second Institutes each built a large classroom that could accommodate more than 200 people, and medium-sized classrooms that could accommodate 60-70 to 100 people. The Second Institute also built a small classroom. Each classroom has brick tables and seats, is well-lit, and clean.

　　太岳“荣教院”节省民力
    自己动手建设教室
    【本报太岳十三日电】太岳“荣教院”自二月初开展立功运动以来，两个月内，全体工作人员背粮担炭，建设教室四座，把荣院变成了学校，节省民力六十七个。该院全年需粮一万八千斤，需炭四万七千斤，以前都得动用民力，但自二月份起，全体人员都亲自动手了。一、二所本来工作人员不够用，但他们每礼拜仍抽出时间去担一次炭。荣休院也都卷入立功浪潮。二所五班五个双目失明的荣休员，经常帮助工作人员工作。一只胳膊的苟法胜和腿上残废行动不便的李顺，都自动到煤窑去担炭。二所一百卅个残废同志都积极紧张的参加搬砖、担水、担土和泥，充分表现出他们为人民服务的高度政治觉悟。失去两臂的吕忠秘同志，不能参加劳动，亦自报奋勇到附近各村动员大庙内的供桌板凳和匾，保证五、六人有一个桌子。段月鳌、贾风建、赵席芝等只有一个膀子，也积极的垒桌子、座位。在大家积极劳动下，一、二所各建设了一个能容纳二百多人的大教室和能容纳六、七十人至百人的中等教室。二所还建设了小教室。每个教室都是用砖垒起来的桌子和座位，光线充足，整齐清洁。
