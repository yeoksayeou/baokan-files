　　Yan'an's Evacuation
    By Strong, translated by Wei Qing

    In November of last year, as Chiang Kai-shek and Hu Zongnan's forces prepared to attack Yan'an, Yan'an had already begun a planned and phased evacuation. This article is a dispatch from American journalist Strong, who witnessed the evacuation situation at that time last year.
   —Editor
          　          　          
    The doctor on duty told me yesterday: "Three thousand babies have already been evacuated from Yan'an. No matter how well we take care of them, some will still die. To avoid strafing and bombing, we travel at night, and winter in the mountains is cold enough."

    Most of the non-combatants in Yan'an have already left or are in the process of evacuating. So when you walk up any hill, you can see merchants' odds and ends, donkeys led by older children. Even the farmers from Yan'an and the surrounding areas are taking their jars of pickled vegetables, pots of cured meat, sacks of rice, and all their household utensils into the deep mountains.

    The most heartbreaking thing is the relocation of the International Peace Hospital. This hospital was established seven years ago with the assistance of Britain, Canada, and the United States. The hospital's name commemorates Dr. Norman Bethune, a renowned Canadian surgeon who sacrificed his life to treat a Chinese person fighting fifteen Japanese soldiers. This hospital has forty-two branches in eight provinces, and the one in Yan'an was the first.

    When we looked at the hospital from the edge of the hill, it seemed no different from the past seven years—nine rows of caves dug under the cliff, with the square hospital administration building. The only difference was a long line of pack teams setting off from the hospital entrance, donkeys carrying two sheepskin-lined baby cradles, the babies sleeping peacefully inside.

    The seriously ill lay on beds, carried by four people step by step down the steep hillside.

　Hospital equipment has been dismantled

    When we walked into the hospital gate, I saw sixty trainee nurses lining up, ready to depart. Each had her own clothes in a small bundle on her back. They were laughing and joking, waving at us as we passed.

    The hospital director, Wei Yizhai, came over to greet us. He apologized, saying that the hospital was busy relocating and could not entertain us properly. He took us to visit the operating room, where only a small pile of packing straw remained on the floor. We quietly entered the X-ray room, which had been set up with great difficulty in the past—the X-ray machine and generator were flown in by the American Red Cross. Now, only an empty number two box lay there quietly.

    The main surgical equipment had already been dismantled. In the past, there were four sets of locally-made equipment here, performing thirty operations every day. The smaller, less important operating room still retained its former glory and a complete set of equipment for emergency needs.

    The laboratory was built on the upper part of the hill. Except for a microscope left for emergency use, everything else was packed. Only a germ incubator remained, waiting to finish its work before being packed and transported with the rest of the equipment.
        
　LA Nursery is now an empty house

    The surgical wards in the fifth cave had also been emptied. Only some patients who needed to be transported by ambulance were lying on beds, wrapped up, and nurses were still taking care of them. In the maternity ward in the sixth cave, there were still six of the forty maternity patients. Two had given birth this morning, and the other four had given birth three days ago and were feeding their babies. They also had to evacuate as soon as possible in the cold night.

    When we left the hospital and said goodbye to Director Wei, he was still quietly and methodically managing his affairs. Walking down the hill, we passed the Los Angeles Nursery, built with donations from Los Angeles, California—which used to house ninety children, waving to passersby from the high cave dwellings. But now it was empty.

    Further down, we met a young couple saying goodbye by the roadside. The man was wearing a clean cotton winter uniform with red insignia, obviously a soldier of the Eighth Route Army. His wife was a nurse in the hospital, wearing faded gray cloth pants, ready to leave. Her eyes were red, obviously having cried. Soon, one would go to the front to defend Yan'an, and the other would go to the rear to care for patients.

    In the afternoon, we visited a small village of only ten households and talked to an old farmer. He was a tenant farmer ten years ago, but now he owns twelve mu of land. Half of the twelve mu was obtained after the land reform, and the other half was reclaimed from the mountains through his own efforts.

    The gist of his conversation with us was: "If Old Chiang wants to fight a civil war, the common people will suffer greatly."

### 延安的疏散

　　延安的疏散
    史特朗作  渭清译
    去年十一月份，蒋胡军拟进攻延安，延安已经开始有计划有步骤的疏散。本文是美国女记者史特朗所目睹的去年当时疏散情形的通讯。 
   ——编者
          　          　          
    昨天值班的医师告诉我说：“有三千个婴孩已经撤出延安了，不管怎样照顾周到，有一些还是要死掉的：为了避免扫射与轰炸，所以在夜间走，而山地里的冬月是够冷的”。
    现在延安大部分的非战斗员已经离开了，有一部分即正在撤退，所以当你走上任何一座山岗时，你都可以看见一些商人零零碎碎的东西，驴子由大一点的孩子在前面牵着。连延安到延安附近的农民们也带了咸菜缸，腌肉瓮，米口袋和一切家用器皿走向深山里去了。
    最使人痛心的是国际和平医院的迁移，这个医院在英国与加拿大和美国的协助下已经开设了七年，医院的名称是纪念一位加拿大的外科名医Dr.NormanBathane而起的，这位名医，他为了医治一个和十五个日本人作战的中国人而牺牲了自己的生命。这医院的分院现有四十二所分布八省，延安的一所是第一个。
    当我们沿着山岗边缘来远眺医院的景物时，看起来好像和过去七年的日子里没有什么两样——九排山洞掘在悬崖下面建筑着方方正正的医院管理处。惟一不同的，就是一长串的驮载队正从医院门口出发，驴子背了两只衬着羊皮的小孩摇篮，孩子在里面安详地睡着。
    病重的人，躺在床上，由四个人抬着一步一步的走下陟峻的山坡。
　医院的装置已经拆卸了
    当我们走进医院大门时，我看见六十个见习的护士正在排队准备出发，每个人把她自己的衣服打成一个小包，背在背上，她们笑着闹着，当我们走过的时候，还在向我们招手。
    医院院长魏益斋走过和我们来招呼，他很抱歉地对我们说，医院正在忙着迁移，不能好好招待我们。他带我们去参观手术室，这里地上只剩下了一小堆包扎用的稻草，我们轻身走进Ｘ光间，这里过去费了很多困难才装成的——Ｘ光及发电机都是美国红十字会用飞机运来的。而现在只有一只二号空箱子静静地躺在那里。
    主要的手术早已拆卸装置好了。在这里过去有整整四台子土造的器械，每天要施行三十次的手术。比较次要而小型的手术间，还保有过去的光荣和一套完整的用具，以备紧急需要。
    化验室建筑在山岗的上部，除了一具显微镜留着以备急需外，其余都已包扎就绪，只有一架细菌养成器留着。要等它工作完毕后，才包装起来和其余用具一起运去。
        ＬＡ托儿所已成空屋
    第五山洞里的外科病房也都搬空了，只剩一些要用救护车运送的病人包扎好了躺在床上，看护依旧在照料他们。第六山洞里的产科病房中，四十个产妇还有六个。其中两个刚在今晨生产，其他四个生产了三天，正在喂婴儿乳食。她们也要尽早地在寒夜中撤出。
    我们离开医院与魏院长告别时，他仍是十分安静地，有条不紊地职掌着他的事务。走下山岗，我们经过洛杉矶托儿所，这是加里福尼州，洛杉矶捐建的——这里经常容纳九十个儿童，从高高的窑洞里同行人招手。而目前已空无一人了。
    再向下走，我们碰到一对青年夫妇，他们正在路旁道别。男的穿了一身像整洁的棉布冬季制服，配以红色符号，一望而知是个八路军的士兵。他的妻子是医院里的护士，她穿了一条褪了色的灰布裤子，正准备启程。她眼睛红红的，显然曾经哭过。等一会儿，一个就要到前方去保卫延安，另一个将到后方去看护病人。
    下午我们去访问了一个仅仅只有十户人家的小村庄，跟一个老农夫谈了一回；他在十年前是佃户，而现在已拥有十二亩土地了，十二亩一半是土地改革后得到的，另一半是自己努力开垦出来的山地。
    他与我们谈话的大意是：“老蒋要打内战，老百姓就要大遭殃”。
