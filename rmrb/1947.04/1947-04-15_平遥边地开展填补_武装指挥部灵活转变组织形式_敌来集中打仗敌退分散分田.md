　　(This dispatch from our newspaper in Taiyue, dated the 13th) Under the cover of guerrilla warfare in Pingyao, popular movements have re-emerged in over eighty villages out of the county's two hundred plus villages, with land leveling and replenishment completed in thirty-eight of them. All twenty-two villages in the First District have implemented land leveling and replenishment; village cadres in the Shimen and Zhangjiazhuang areas have also redistributed excess fruits. In the Second District, thirty-six out of fifty-nine administrative villages have promoted land leveling and replenishment. In Huangyi Village, under the persistent leadership of cadres, the entire village blocked road entrances with landmines, and militiamen stood guard to carry out the struggle, and held a celebration meeting of "Land Returning Home". In eight villages including Huabao, located ten miles from the enemy, the masses, after dispelling concerns about "retribution", jointly struggled against the major tyrant Hou Huihao. Militiamen from the eight villages took turns on joint defense sentry duty, and laid mines at night, completing the struggle in two days. Struggles have also begun in Houbi, Qiaojiashan, and Zhushenmiao areas, with Houbi having already struggled against three tyrants. In most villages in the Fifth District, which are threatened by the enemy, land reform is also being actively carried out. Their method of work is to establish an armed headquarters and armed offices, organize district and village cadres into turning-over teams, leaving a few people behind to persist in the work, and advancing the majority forward. The work is not divided into armed struggle and mass mobilization; when the enemy comes, they are fully armed to strike the enemy, and when the enemy leaves, they devote their full efforts to carrying out land reform. Due to the good coordination between land reform and armed forces, land reform has been carried out in thirteen out of the thirty-eight administrative villages in the entire district. In the Third District, after the anti-"retribution" campaign, villages such as Zhukang and Xujiashuang have begun to brew struggles. The retreat situation in the Fourth District has stopped, and it is advancing towards the Dongxi Bu Liang and Duan villages area. Out of the fifty-two administrative villages in the entire district, ten villages including Liangjiatan are still carrying out anti-maintenance and anti-retribution campaigns, while the rest are carrying out land reform.
    (This dispatch from our newspaper in Taiyue, dated the 13th) Pingyao has achieved great results with psychological warfare tactics. Wen Jinbao, a landlord in Liangpodi village who was liquidated, was lured by Chiang Kai-shek's agents and fled to the city. Recently, he returned to the village to "retribution." As soon as he entered the door, his uncle grabbed him and knelt him on the ground, advising him: "If you think about the things you used to do in the village to oppress and exploit people, you will know that it is right for the masses to ask you for land. Now, as an elder, I kowtow to you, you decide what to do!" So Wen Jinbao returned to the city without saying a word. A liquidated landlord ×× in the village also returned to the village to "retribution", and was educated by his brother, and since then he has been law-abiding. After our psychological warfare against Yan's military officers and soldiers, from December of last winter to the present, as many as one hundred and seventy-seven people have defected from the city, Qidong, Sanxi and other strongholds to our liberated areas. According to Yan's soldiers who escaped: Yan's army is afraid of our army's divine power, and does not know when they will be captured. They are uneasy and are looking for relations with us to leave a way out. The reason why this psychological warfare can achieve such results, in addition to the cold guns and explosions of the local militia, there are three elements: 1. Convene meetings of the families of fleeing landlords and stubborn soldiers. After a family member of a fleeing landlord in the Third District finished the meeting, she went to the enemy stronghold Sunjiabao to cry bitterly to her husband, advising him to go home and not to carry out "retribution". 2. Universally distribute leaflets and paint slogans around enemy strongholds. 3. Record merits and demerits, compile quick-board rhymes and songs and circulate them in enemy-occupied villages. For example, a village in the Fifth District recorded a crime for a retributionist, and after he heard about it, he found someone to mediate, and declared that he would offset his crimes with merits in the future.

　　平遥边地开展填补
    武装指挥部灵活转变组织形式
    敌来集中打仗敌退分散分田
    【本报太岳十三日电】平遥在游击战掩护下，全县二百余村中有八十个村群运再起，其中三十八个村实行了填平补齐。一区二十二个村全部实行了填补；石门、张家庄一带村干部也已匀出多得果实。二区五十九个行政村中亦有三十六村推行填补。黄伊村在干部的坚持带领下，全村用地雷封锁路口，民兵放哨，进行斗争，并开庆祝土地回家大会。在离敌人十里的花堡等八村群众，解除怕“倒算”的顾虑后，联合斗争了大恶霸侯晦豪。八村民兵轮流放联防哨，夜间埋雷，两日完成了斗争。侯壁、乔家山、潴神庙一带斗争也已开始，侯壁已经斗争了三个恶霸。五区大部村受到敌人的威胁，但土地改革亦积极进行，他们的工作方法是成立武装指挥部及武装办公室，把区村干部组成翻身队，留少数人在后坚持工作，大部向前推进。工作不分武装民运，当敌人来了就完全武装打击敌人，敌人走了全力进行土地改革。由于土地改革和武装配合的很好，全区三十八个行政村已有十三个村进行土地改革。三区反“倒算”后，朱抗、许家庄等村，已开始酝酿斗争。四区退缩局面已停止，正向东西卜两、段村一带推进。全区五十二个行政村中，有梁家滩等十个村还在开展反维持反倒算外，其余均进行土地改革。
    【本报太岳十三日电】平遥以攻心战术获得很大成绩。梁坡底村被清算地主温金保，受蒋特利诱，逃往城内，最近曾返村“倒算”，刚进门便被其叔父一把拉住，跪在地上劝他说：“你如果想想过去在村欺压剥削人家的事情，就会知道群众向你要地是应该的，现在我以长辈给你磕上一个头，你看着办吧！”于是温金保便一言不发的返回城内。该村被清算地主××亦回村“倒算”，被其哥教育了一番，从此便安分守己了。阎军官兵经我之攻心战后，从去冬十二月至现在，由城内、七洞，三禧等据点纷纷投奔我解放区者即达一百七十七人。据逃来之阎军士兵谈：阎军摄于我军神威，不知何日即有就擒之危险，惶惶不安，都在寻找与我之关系，以留后路。此一攻心战之所以能收到如此效果，除该地民兵之冷枪、爆炸外，尚有三个要素：一、召开逃亡地主及顽军家属会议。三区一逃亡地主家属在开完会后，便到敌据点孙家堡给她丈夫痛哭一场，劝告其回家，勿再进行“倒算”。二、普遍的向敌据点周围散放传单，涂写标语。三、记功记罪、编写快板、歌子流传敌占村庄。如五区某村给一个倒算分子记了罪，他听到后，便找人说合，并声明今后要以功折罪。
