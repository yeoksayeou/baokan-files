　　On Initiative
    Luo Yunlu
    There are two kinds of initiative: one is truly revolutionary initiative, and the other is petty-bourgeois initiative.

    Workers with the former kind of initiative are very subtle in their expression. Their work doesn't focus on personal prominence, but rather on playing a core role and leading the masses. They are very good at helping others, skilled at leveraging others' strengths and making up for their weaknesses. They give credit and achievements to others first; they examine themselves first for errors and shortcomings. When this kind of worker leads or participates in the work of a department, they make all the comrades in that department active and energetic. They can also humbly listen to the opinions of the masses and constantly improve themselves.

    Workers with the latter kind of initiative, on the other hand, are sharp-edged, fond of showing off, and always displaying themselves. They are the least capable of helping others; sometimes, in order to appear active, or to help others in form only, their real purpose is to elevate themselves. They often cannot see or deliberately conceal the strengths of others; they expose or attack the shortcomings of others (not to help them improve in good faith). They attribute credit and achievements to themselves and push errors and shortcomings to others. When this kind of worker leads or participates in the work of a department, it appears that only they are active and capable, and that others are not active. In reality, they are hindering the initiative of others. They are also not humble at all, self-righteous, stubborn, and find it difficult to accept criticism and improve themselves.

    Workers with the former kind of initiative act entirely from the standpoint of revolutionary work, with pure motives and no selfishness. Their initiative is constant and lasting. Regardless of the environment, the conditions, whether they are doing leadership work or being led; whether they are satisfied with the work or not; whether it is smooth or not; whether they are "rising" or "falling," or doing a job for a long time without promotion, they consistently and persistently maintain their initiative. This kind of initiative, when encountering difficulties, will inevitably have the courage to overcome them.

    Workers with the latter kind of initiative, on the other hand, do not act from the standpoint of revolutionary work, or not entirely, and their motives are impure, with a strong sense of selfishness. This kind of initiative cannot withstand long-term testing. It is wave-like, sometimes active, sometimes passive. They only show initiative in certain environmental conditions that are suitable for their personal requirements, otherwise they show passivity; they show initiative when doing leadership work and when the work is smooth and successful; they are passive when doing led work, or when the work is not smooth or satisfactory; they can only be promoted, not demoted. The expression of this kind of initiative is often to show themselves, to demand promotion from the organization, in order to achieve the purpose of raising their personal status, or other personal purposes. If personal goals are not achieved, they gradually become passive, even emotional. When encountering difficulties, they become even more dejected and unable to recover.

    The former kind of initiative is collectivist. It recognizes the power of the collective, understands the relationship between the individual and the collective, and the role that the individual should play in collective life or collective work; therefore, it is also good at leveraging the power of the collective. This kind of initiative not only has abundant "creativity," which can improve work efficiency and promote revolutionary work, but also can enhance the unity of cadre relations and make them more progressive.

    The latter kind of initiative is individualistic. Because it does not recognize the greatness of collective power (only this power can make the revolution victorious), and even less understands the relationship between the individual and the collective, it emphasizes the individual's "ability" and "role" one-sidedly. It is not only not good at leveraging the power of the collective, but also intentionally or unintentionally hinders the exertion of collective power in order to show the individual's role. This kind of initiative is unlikely to have any "creativity." It not only cannot promote revolutionary work, but is very likely to reduce work efficiency and will cause cadres to have opinions, emotions, and disunity with each other.

    Obviously, we need the former kind of initiative in our revolutionary work. As for the latter kind of initiative, we not only do not need it, but resolutely oppose it.

　　论积极性
    罗云路
    有两种积极性：一种是真正革命的积极性，一种是小资产阶级的积极性。
    具有前一种积极性的工作者，表现是非常含蓄的，工作不是个人突出，而是骨干作用，带动群众。他很能帮助别人，善于发挥别人的长处，弥补别人的短处。有功劳和成绩，尽先让给别人；有错误和缺点，首先检讨自己。这种工作者领导或参加一个部门工作时，就使得这一个部门工作的所有同志都积极活跃起来。他也能虚心的听取群众的意见，不断的进步。
    具有后一种积极性的工作者，则是锋芒毕露，风头主义，处处表现自己。他最不能帮助别人，有时为了表现积极，或者形式上帮助别人一下，实际目的则在抬高自己。他常是看不见或故意掩盖别人的长处；揭露或攻击别人的短处（不是善意的帮助别人改进）。功劳、成绩归自己，错误缺点推别人。这种工作者领导或参加一个部门工作时，就显得只有他一个人积极能干，别的人都不积极，实际上则是他妨碍了别人的积极性。他还是毫不虚心，自以为是，固执己见，很难接受批评改进自己。
    具有前一种积极性的工作者，完全是从革命工作立场出发，动机纯洁，毫无私心。他的积极性，是经常的、持久的。不论在任何环境，任何条件之下，也不论是做领导工作，或被领导工作；工作满意也好，不满意也好；顺利也罢，不顺利也罢；无论“上升”或“下降”，或长时期做一个工作，没有提拔，都是一贯的，始终不懈的保持其积极性。这种积极性，遇到困难，必然还有勇于克服困难的精神。
    具有后一种积极性的工作者，则不是，或不完全是从革命工作立场出发，动机不纯，带有浓厚的自私心。这种积极性，经不起长时期的考验，是波浪式的，有时积极，有时消极。只在某种适合于个人要求的环境条件下，才表现积极，否则就表现消极；作领导工作及工作顺利得意时，表现积极；作被领导工作，或工作不顺利，不满意时，就消极；只能升级，不能降级。这种积极性的表现常是为了表现自己，要求组织提拔，以达到提高个人地位，或其他个人目的的。如果个人目的未能实现即渐渐消极，甚至闹情绪。一遇到困难，则更会垂头丧气，无法振作。
    前一种积极性，是集体主义的，它认识集体的力量，懂得个人与集体的关系，以及个人在集体生活中或集体工作中所应起的作用；因此它也就善于发挥集体的力量，这种积极性，不仅有丰富的“创造性”，能够提高工作效能推进革命工作，而且能使干部关系增强团结，更加进步。
    后一种积极性，是个人主义的，由于它不认识集体力量的伟大（只有这种力量才能使革命胜利），更不懂得个人与集体的关系，一意强调个人的“能力”“作用”，它不仅不善于发挥集体的力量，而且为了表现个人的作用，还有意或无意的妨碍着集体力量的发挥。这种积极性，就很难有什么“创造性”，不仅不能推进革命工作，而且很可能是降低了工作效能，并将造成干部互相之间闹意见，闹情绪，不团结。
    很明显，我们革命工作中须要前一种积极性，至于后一种积极性，则不但不需要，而且坚决反对它。
