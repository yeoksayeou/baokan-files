　　Hu Zhuang, in the Fourth District of Zhuxian, is doing a good job of combining land distribution, spring plowing, and re-examination. After the village cadres returned from the sub-district meeting, they held a village meeting that evening, starting with "Qingming is coming, hurry up and harrow the fields," which raised questions such as "How to harrow the fields?", "How to divide the land?", "What to do if there are no rakes or ropes?", and "What to do if we are too busy collecting education grain?". After group discussions and consultations, all the problems were solved. The next day, they divided into two groups: one group checked the land and registered how many mu each person should have, and how many mu each household had in total, issuing slips to the households so they could make plans. The other group cleared out the hidden wealth buried by landlords. First, they held a meeting to talk about how poor and miserable they were in the past, how they turned themselves around, and how well they had turned themselves around. Then, they talked about how the landlords' lives were compared to theirs, and whether they should be better off than them. All kinds of grievances were poured out, which excited everyone. Therefore, the re-examination proceeded smoothly. In the evening, they held a meeting to discuss the division of land, mutual aid in spring plowing, and the division of labor for collecting education grain. On the third day, the division of labor was even better. First, the village chief and four members of the financial committee collected education grain at the village office, and the women of each household delivered it. Second, the chairman of the farmers' association led the land distribution households to gather for land distribution. First, the landlord was asked to send a clerk to lead them to identify the land plots and insert land markers. Everyone carried flags and beat drums, and men, women, old and young, all went. Everyone said, "It is truly reasonable for the land to return to its home." Everyone was happy. Third, the vice-chairman of the farmers' association led fourteen plows downhill. One plow was followed by three people smashing clods. Five impartial people were selected to harrow the land, directing them to harrow the land for the military families of those participating in the war first. On that day, they harrowed more than 120 mu. In previous years, more than 80 mu of spring land would take twelve days, but this year it can be harrowed in a little more than six days.

　　[本报讯] All villages in the Fourth District of Guancheng are conducting evaluations and distributing fruits, but this is the time to harrow the land, deliver manure, and plant, and the farming season cannot be delayed. At the same time, distributing the fruits is a complex and meticulous task, and village cadres and activists are holding meetings all day and night to evaluate and handle the fruits. At this time, the members of the masses were organized to divide the work. One part of the force was used to clean up the fruits, and another part of the force used the newly recovered livestock and vehicles to harrow the land and deliver manure. The whole village provided great mutual assistance. Because the evaluators evaluated the fruits, they first harrowed the land and pulled manure for them and the military families, and then harrowed all the newly recovered autumn land, regardless of who it was distributed to. Now the land in all the villages has been harrowed.

    一面分田一面耙地
    观城四区分果实中秋地全部耙完
    【本报讯】筑先四区胡庄，分地、春耕、复查结合进行的好。该村村干从小区开会回去，当晚就开村民大会，从“到清明了，赶快耙地”谈起，引起“地怎么耙”、“地怎么分”、“没有耙没有绳怎么办”、“还要敛教育粮忙不过来怎么办”等问题。分组检讨、大家商量，结果问题都解决了。第二天分两伙干，一伙查地登记，每人该几亩？某户共几亩？都开条子给花户，叫花户作打算。另一伙清理地主埋藏的浮财，先开会谈谈，从前怎样穷怎样苦，怎样翻的身，翻的怎么样，再谈谈地主生活比咱怎么样，是不是该比咱强。各种苦水一齐倒，激动得大家嗷嗷叫。因此复查顺利进行。晚上开会又讨论了分地，互助春耕，敛教育粮分工的办法，第三天分工更好了。一、村长财委共四人，在村公所敛教育粮，各户妇女送。二、农会长带领分地户集合分地，先叫地主送文书领着认地块，插地标，大家挑着旗，打着鼓，男女老少都去了。大家说：“土地回老家，才真合理。”大家都欢喜。三、副农会长领十四盘耙下坡，一盘耙跟着三个砸圪垃的，选出五个公道人耙地，指挥着先给军属参战的耙。当天耙了一顷二十多亩，八顷多春地往年要十二天，今年六天多即可耙完。
    【本报讯】观城四区各村都在进行评议，分配果实，但这时正该耙地、送粪、种地，不能犋农时，同时分果实又是一个复杂细致的工作，村干积极分子，都整天半夜开会，评议处理果实。这时就把会员群众组织起来分工，一部力量进行清理果实，一部力量用上刚收回的牲口、车辆进行耙地、送粪，全村大互助，因评议员评议果实，首先来耙他们与军属的地，拉他们的粪，然后把所有新收回的秋地，不论分给谁的都耙了，现在各村的地都耙完了。
