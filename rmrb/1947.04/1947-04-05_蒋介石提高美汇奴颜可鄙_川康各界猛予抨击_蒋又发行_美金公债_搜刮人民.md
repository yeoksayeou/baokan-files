　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st (Delayed Dispatch): Chongqing News: Chiang Kai-shek's "Emergency Economic Measures" have aroused strong criticism from people in the KMT-controlled areas. On February 21st, when people from the business community in Chengdu and economics professors from various universities held a forum, Le Zhaokui, Chairman of the Sichuan-West Labor Association, said: "To balance finances, military spending must be reduced; otherwise, 'balancing finances' is equal to zero. The main problem today is inflation. If it is not treated, we will be finished!" Zhong Yunhe, Chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, said: "The main difficulty for industry and commerce is that taxes are too high." Yang Bokang, Director-General of the Sichuan-Kang Export Trade Research Association, said: "We do not want to receive this measure that is generous in words but not in deeds!" Professor Huang Xianzhang pointed out: "There are only two ways to solve the economic crisis: one is to stop the civil war and reduce huge expenses; the other is to clarify governance, make finances transparent, and abolish bureaucratic comprador capital." Professor Peng Dixian of Sichuan University more profoundly pointed out: "Inflation is the most despicable act of exploiting the people. This increase in foreign exchange rates is said to be 'at the request of friendly nations,' which shows that our Chinese economic policy must be dictated by the United States." Professor Zhang Xianchen of Sichuan University incisively said: "Price controls will hinder production, and increased taxes will affect industry and commerce, which will allow a few people to make money and destroy most businesses. The purpose of this measure is only to strengthen the civil war." Professor Zhu Jiannong said: "The result of increasing tax revenues and controlling prices will be unimaginable suffering for the people!"
　　
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 2nd: After the promulgation of Chiang Kai-shek's "Emergency Economic Measures Plan," jewelry stores in Nanjing, Shanghai, and other places closed down one after another. According to Shanghai newspapers: Several long-established and large jewelry stores on Nanjing Road in Shanghai, such as Qiu Zibao, Fang Jiuxia, Yang Qinghe, and Fei Wenyuan, have successively closed down due to the prohibition of free trading in gold. The jewelry industry in Nanjing has also suffered a major blow. One jewelry store owner said: "I hope the government can give us a bowl of rice to eat." The manager of the Continental Bank said: "From now on, commercial banks will be completely bound!" Several jewelry stores have also closed down on the most lively streets in Beiping, such as Dongsi, Xidan, and Gulou, and commerce has suddenly become depressed.
　　
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st: According to a Central News Agency report: The Chiang government has recently issued so-called "short-term treasury bills" and "U.S. dollar bonds" and has organized "fundraising and sales committees" in various places to carry out this work. The purpose of these bonds is clearly to further plunder the people in the KMT-controlled areas in an attempt to salvage the current serious financial crisis.

　　蒋介石提高美汇奴颜可鄙
    川康各界猛予抨击
    蒋又发行“美金公债”搜刮人民
    【新华社陕北一日电】（迟到）渝讯：蒋介石的“经济紧急措施”，已引起蒋管区各界人士猛烈抨击。二月二十一日，成都工商界人士及各大学经济系教授开座谈会时，川西劳工协会理事长乐兆馗称：“要平衡财政，必须减少军费，不如此则‘平衡财政’等于零。今天主要问题是通货膨胀，再不医治，只有完蛋！”市商会理事长钟云鹤称：“工商业的主要困难是税太重。”川康出口贸易研究会总干事杨伯康称：“对此口惠实不至的措施，我们不愿领情！”黄宪章教授指出：“解决经济危机，只有两项办法：一是停止内战、减少庞大经费；二是澄清更治、财政公开，取消官僚买办资本。”川大教授彭迪先更深刻地指出：“通货膨胀是剥削人民最卑鄙的行为，此次提高外汇，听说是‘应友邦之请’，可见我们中国的经济政策要看美国的脸色。”川大教授张先辰一针见血的说：“物价管制要妨碍生产，增加税收要影响工商业，将使少数人赚钱，多数商业遭破坏。这一措施，目的不过是为了加强内战。”朱剑农教授说：“增加税源、物价管制的结果，人民将苦到不可想像的地步！”
    【新华社陕北二日电】蒋介石之“经济紧急措施方案”公布后，京沪各地银楼纷纷倒闭。据沪报载：上海南京路几座历史悠久规模宏大的裘子宝、方九霞、杨庆和、费文元等银楼，因禁止黄金自由买卖相继停业。南京之银楼业，亦受重大摧折。一位银楼老板说：“希望政府能赏我们一碗饭吃。”大陆银行经理说：“此后商业银行完全被束缚起来了！”北平最热闹的东四、西单、鼓楼等大街，亦有数家银楼倒闭，商业顿呈萧条。
    【新华社陕北一日电】据中央社消息：蒋政府顷又发行所谓“短期库券”及“美金公债”，并于各地组织“募销委员会”，进行此项工作。该债券之目的，显为对蒋管区人民之进一步搜刮，企图挽救目前严重存在之财政危机。
