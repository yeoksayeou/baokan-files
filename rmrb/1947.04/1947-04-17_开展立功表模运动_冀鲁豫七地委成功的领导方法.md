　　Launching a Merit and Model Movement
    Successful Leadership Methods of the Jiluyu Seventh Prefectural Committee
    Xiao Xia
    The merit and model movement launched by the Jiluyu Seventh Prefectural Committee is a successful leadership method that aims to improve the ideological construction of cadres, enhance their enthusiasm, and transform their work style from a positive perspective. This new leadership method has brought about significant changes in the ideological work style of cadres in Jiluyu, and a surge of striving for merit and becoming a model has already formed in some areas.
    Since the movement began, cadres' enthusiasm has been significantly enhanced in both enemy-occupied and recovered areas, during guerrilla warfare, and in land reform and war support efforts, with many innovations. For example, cadres leading the emancipation of peasants have fainted from exhaustion; in the Nanwang Sixth District work group, a female cadre who had only been detached from production for six months cried at the commendation meeting because she had not completed her assigned task. Li Shouchun, a cadre in Guancheng District, is an elderly man of fifty years old. He said, "I am old and can only work for a few more years. I want to perform meritorious service for the people first." Since the self-defense war began, he has carried stretchers to the front lines eighteen times consecutively, becoming a banner in his work. His spirit of serving the people moved his comrades to tears at a county activists' meeting. The comrades who attended the meeting said, "That is truly a meeting of the Communist Party!" This time, when the enemy invaded Jiaxiang, no district retreated, and they told the female cadres to evacuate first. The female comrades said, "We will also carry guns and fight!" Cadres who were ordered to retreat to the sidelines actively requested to lead the militia in, saying, "Don't let the landlords倒粮 (daolang, a practice of reversing gains made by the people) and kill the activists." When the enemy came the first time, the old man Xu Guangdian showed signs of retreating, but this time he requested to "redeem himself through meritorious service." Gao Hai Village is not far from the city. District cadres led the masses to divide the fruits of victory and persisted until dark. A female cadre in Jining Fourth District carried a gun with the militia and fought the enemy for half a day. During the war support efforts, cadres were initially unwilling to carry stretchers to the front lines. Since the call to perform meritorious service for the people, cadres have been vying to go, and their feet are covered in blisters each time they return. The masses in Nanwang County did not replace the shift cadres. Although they were very tired, they disregarded the hardship and continuously carried stretchers to the front lines in order not to affect the progress of land reform. They said, "Anyway, it is to perform meritorious service for the people." The cadres carrying out land reform in the rear knew of their hard work and saved up to cook a good meal to comfort them; when the county learned of this, they quickly wrote letters of condolence. This not only solved the problem of combining land reform and war support, but also made the relationship between cadres closer and more united. The cadres carrying stretchers in the Second District took care of the stretcher-bearers a hundred times over, patiently educating them. As a result, the relationship between cadres and the people became even closer. Each time they returned from carrying stretchers, they held a commendation meeting. Although everyone was very tired, they were very happy spiritually. The Ciqiu branch of Wenshang led the masses in the village to carry out land reform and participate in the war at the same time. Each time the masses in the village returned from participating in the war (carrying stretchers, pulling carts, etc.), the branch led the people at home to welcome them, prepare hot water for washing their feet, and comfort them with a public meal. Although those who went out were tired, they were also very happy to have received land and grain at home. Both sides expressed their hardship to each other, filled with an atmosphere of unity and happiness. The armed work teams in the enemy-occupied areas led the masses to fight back against the landlord’s倒算 (daosuan, reversal of accounts after land reform), dig tunnels, and insist on fighting, striving to go out and attack the enemy regardless of life and death. The landlords spread rumors saying, "The Eighth Route Army has been wiped out by 300,000." Hou Baotai, the captain of an armed work team in our Fifth Sub-district, said, "I don't care if the Eighth Route Army is wiped out by 500,000, as long as these ten or so of us are here, no one can do bad things. My right is to dare to let go of the good people and dare to kill the bad people. If the Chiang troops come, I will hide, but the landlords must not be allowed to倒粮 (daolang, a practice of reversing gains made by the people). If you have high walls, I can still climb over them and kill your whole family." The landlords had no choice but to move the things they had倒去 (daoqu, reversed) back to the masses. In addition, the peasant congress in Yanggu; holding a gun in one hand and distributing land in the border area of Hexi; the combination of war support and land reform in Guancheng, etc., are all creations since the establishment of meritorious service and model recognition.
    In the relationship between leaders and the masses, not only has the serious phenomenon of being divorced from the masses been overcome, but it has also gradually become closer than before, and the leadership has taken a step further. The relationship between superiors and subordinates has been improved unprecedentedly. A county committee comrade of the Seventh Prefectural Committee felt that "the relationship with the prefectural committee has never been as good as it is now in recent years."
    Dealing with cadre issues is not as difficult as it was before, because there are living examples and directions. The saying that "burying one's head in hard work cannot escape being ugly; being a loafer cannot get any benefits" has disappeared invisibly.
    This new leadership method gradually developed and became clear after the "anti-bureaucracy" and "investigating work style and establishing merit" movements among the masses.
    Before the anti-bureaucracy movement, the phenomenon of some cadres in the area being divorced from the masses was serious. During the guerrilla war, they showed fear and retreated, and during the land reform, they distributed too many fruits of victory, embezzled the fruits, or bought them cheaply. Another part of the cadres was dissatisfied with the organization and proclaimed themselves "meritorious officials."
    Initially, the leadership did not handle these problems well, and some places even held a "turning a blind eye" attitude. On the other hand, good cadres were not promptly praised and encouraged to set an example for the entire area. Therefore, "evil" could not be stopped, and righteousness could not be raised. As a result, cadre work also showed signs of exhaustion and depression.
    Later, the leadership put forward anti-bureaucracy to solve these problems. Self-reflection and inspections were carried out from the county to the district, which aroused the vigilance of the cadres. The serious phenomenon of being divorced from the masses was considerably corrected. Cadres who usually performed well reflected at this time, "The leadership has opened one eye" (meaning that they saw the bad parts). However, what was expressed in the overall cadre mood and work was that the "countered" cadres showed depression, most of the good cadres remained silent and had opinions, generally expressing "not seeking merit, but seeking no fault." Some reflected "only investigating the lower level, not investigating themselves" (referring to the leadership), and the enthusiasm for work was not developed.
    The reason for this effect is, as some cadres reflected, "The leadership only opened one eye." This eye only sees shortcomings, not advantages, only sees problems, not strengths. Therefore, it can only passively block the mouth, but cannot actively point out the way out. It can only criticize shortcomings, but cannot acknowledge people's advantages, achievements, and creations. As the Jining Fourth District Committee put it, "We have put in a lot of effort, but our advantages have never been praised." Because another active eye has not been opened, the enthusiasm and creativity of the cadres cannot be developed, and the work still lacks a clear direction and an example for progress and improvement.
    After the above review, the leadership's thinking was clearer than before, and they realized that they should start by praising cadres and setting up examples. However, at the same time, they felt that the many serious phenomena of being divorced from the masses in the past must be cleared up. Therefore, they put forward the "investigating work style and establishing merit" movement. The intention of the leadership was to first investigate work style and then establish merit, and to lay the foundation for establishing merit from the investigation of work style. The investigation of work style itself should be to investigate both shortcomings and advantages. The advantages can be praised, and the shortcomings can be cleared up to seek overcoming. However, in the implementation, it formed only investigating shortcomings, not investigating advantages, and focusing on investigating work style and establishing merit separately from the current central work. In fact, the establishment of merit itself includes criticism and praise. The essence of investigating work style first and then establishing merit is still more passive than active, and the energy of rectifying the past is greater than the energy of looking to the future. Therefore, cadre transformation and work enthusiasm have not been developed. From the perspective of the current work, investigating work style and establishing merit without combining the central work will stop the development of the work, and "merit" cannot be established.
    The Seventh Prefectural Committee further thoroughly reviewed the above experience before summarizing that the key to strengthening ideological leadership lies in launching a merit and model movement. From the positive side, praise cadres and transform cadres to overcome the phenomenon of cadres being divorced from the masses and improve their work enthusiasm. Negative blocking, criticism, and punishment cannot solve the problem, and they further restrict the development of mass enthusiasm and bold creativity. After the leadership clearly put forward "establishing merit and recognizing models," the cadres generally reflected, "The leadership has opened both eyes!" A new atmosphere emerged. The ideological work style of the cadres immediately underwent great changes, and the establishment of merit and model recognition immediately formed a surge.
    Facts fully prove that the launch of the "merit and model movement" has powerfully inspired the cadres' class consciousness, established the cadres' idea of wholeheartedly "serving the people," and unprecedentedly improved their enthusiasm.
    We should launch the merit and model movement from top to bottom and from bottom to top. The specific method of this movement must be combined with the current work tasks, and we must regularly summarize work, commend merit, and recognize models. Some counties have established merit recording committees from the county to the district. The county and district groups have established "merit books" to record merits, demerits, and model deeds, and gradually become accustomed to becoming a system. The merits, demerits, and model deeds of cadres should be included in the appraisal form by the cadre management department, stored in the archives, and used as the basis for promoting cadres.
    The conditions for "establishing merit and recognizing models" are difficult to specify concretely. We can only put forward struggle goals to avoid making subjective circles and restricting the development of the movement. The direction put forward by the Jiluyu District Committee is: First, complete the task and complete it better than others; second, be able to discover new problems in the work and have new creations; third, be able to lead the masses, contact the masses, and follow the mass line.
    Models are not perfect, so the requirements for models should not be too high. We can only proceed from the specific circumstances of the time and place. If the leadership can recognize his relatively high point, he can play a leading role.
    We must pay attention to consolidating the models. After the models are selected and publicly praised, we must pay attention to individual education and training, point out their weaknesses, and enable them to continue to improve, so as to avoid pride and being divorced from the masses. We must not select them and ignore them, or use their views.
    The leadership should regularly hold meetings and discussions to make them a direction in the work. Model deeds should be broadcast in a timely manner as examples for the masses to learn from.
    Cadres can redeem themselves through meritorious service and offset their crimes with merit, but merit cannot be reduced due to crime.
    The merit and model movement in Jiluyu is only the beginning of universal development, but experience in individual areas proves that this is a positive direction, this is a concrete embodiment of ideological leadership, and this is the road to establishing our correct position and methods. The current problem of the relationship between cadres and the people can be solved by launching a merit and model movement, and the launch of the merit and model movement can prevent or reduce the occurrence of such problems in the future. We should affirm and promote the ideological leadership of establishing merit and recognizing models.

　　开展立功表模运动
    冀鲁豫七地委成功的领导方法
    萧峡
    冀鲁豫七地委开展的立功表模运动，是从积极方面进行干部思想建设，提高干部积极性，而达到改造干部作风的成功的领导方法。这一新的领导方法，使冀鲁豫干部思想作风都起了很大的变化，个别地区已形成立功、表模的热潮。
    运动以来，不管在敌占区或收复区，在游击战中或土地改革、战勤中，干部积极性得到了显著的发挥，并且有不少的创造。如领导翻身的干部，有的累得晕过去了；南旺六区工作组里，一个刚脱离生产六个月的妇女干部，因没完成分给她的任务，在评功会上气得哭了。观城区干部李守诚，是五十岁的老人，他说：“我老了，还能干几年，我要先给人民立功。”自卫战争以来，带担架上前方，连续十八次，他已成为工作中的旗帜，他的为人民服务的精神，在一次县活动分子会上，感动得同志们流泪，参加会的同志们说：“那才真是共产党的会哩！”这次敌人侵犯嘉祥，各区没有退缩的，叫妇女干部先转移，妇女同志们说：“俺也背上枪打！”奉命退到边上来的干部，积极要求带领民兵进去，他们说：“别叫地主倒了粮，杀了积极分子”。第一次敌人来时，老头许光典表现退缩，这次要求“戴罪立功”。高海村离城不远，区干领导群众分果实，一直坚持到天黑。济宁四区一个妇女干部，跟民兵背着枪，给敌人打了半天。战勤中，原先干部都不愿带担架到前方，号召为人民立功以来，干部争着去，每次回来脚上都打满了泡。南旺县群众换班干部不换，虽然他们很累，为不影响土地改革的进行，都不顾艰苦，连续带担架去前方，他们说：“反正是为人民立功。”后方进行土地改革的干部，知道他们辛苦，节约做顿好饭慰劳他们；县里知道了，也很快写信慰问，这不仅解决了土地改革与战勤的给合问题，而且在干部间的关系上，也更加亲密与团结。二区带担架的干部，百倍的照顾抬担架的群众，耐心的进行教育，因之干民关系，更加密切，每带一次担架回来，即进行一次评功，大家虽然十分劳累，但精神上却非常愉快。汶上磁丘支部，领导本村群众，一面进行土地改革，一面参战。村里的群众，每次参战（抬担架、拉大车等）回来，支部即领导在家群众去欢迎他们，烧好洗脚水，还慰劳他们吃顿公饭，参战回来，家里分到土地、粮食，出发的人，虽然辛苦，但也很高兴，双方互道辛苦，充满了团结愉快的空气。敌占区里的武工队，领导群众反倒算，挖地道坚持斗争，争着出去袭击敌人，他们为了立功，不顾生死的坚持着斗争。地主造谣说：“八路军被消灭了三十万”，我们五分区的一个武工队长侯保太说：“八路军被消灭五十万我也不管，只要俺这十来个人在着，谁坏也不行，我的权利是好人敢放，坏人敢杀，蒋军来了我躲躲，地主要倒粮反正不行，你有高墙我也能翻进去杀你全家。”地主们不得不把倒去的东西，再给群众搬回去。另外，阳谷的农民大会；河西边缘区的一手拿枪，一手分田；观城战勤与土地改革的结合等等，都是立功表模以来的创造。
    在领导与群众的关系上，不仅克服了脱离群众的严重现象，而且较前逐渐密切了，领导上也深入了一步。上下级的关系上，得到了空前的改善，七地委一个县委同志感到“几年来没有象现在与地委关系这样好”。
    在干部问题的处理上，不像先前那样的困难了，因为有了活的榜样与方向。“埋头苦干，脱不了难看；吊儿浪当，当不着吃香”的说法，已无形消失。
    这一新的领导方法，是在群众中经过“反官僚主义”，“查风立功”运动之后，才逐渐发展明确起来的。
    在反官僚主义之前，该区部分干部脱离群众现象是严重的。在游击战争中，又表现出害怕退缩，土地改革中，则多分果实，贪污果实，或贱买果实。另一部分干部，不满意组织，“功臣”自封。
    对这些问题，领导上开始没有很好处理，有些地方还抱着“睁着一个眼，合着一个眼”要理不理的态度。另一方面，对好的干部也未能及时表扬、鼓励，示范全区，所以“邪气”不能制止，正气则不能抬头，因此，干部工作也都表现出疲塌消沉。
    以后领导上提出了反官僚主义来解决这些问题。从县到区进行了反省检查，引起了干部的警惕，严重脱离群众的现象，得到了相当的纠正，平时表现较好的干部，此时反映说：“领导上睁开了一只眼睛”（意思是看到坏的部分）。但表现到整个干部情绪与工作上的却是：被“反”的干部表现苦闷，多数好的干部，仍然沉默，且有意见，一般表示“不求有功，但求无过”。有的则反映“只查下边，不查自己”（指领导上），工作的积极性，并未得到发扬。
    所以出现这样的效果，正像某些干部所反映的“领导上只睁开了一只眼睛”。这只眼睛是只看缺点，不看优点，只看毛病，不看长处。因之只是消极的堵口，而不能积极的指出出路，只能批评缺点，不能承认人家的优点、成绩与创造。正如济宁四区分委提的“俺们出力很大，优点却从未得到表扬”。因为另一只积极的眼睛还未睁开，所以干部的积极性和创造性未能发挥，工作中仍然缺乏明确方向和前进与提高的榜样。
    经过以上的检讨，领导思想上较前明确了一步，认识到要从表扬干部、树立榜样入手；但同时又感到从前脱离群众的许多严重现象，必须得到清理，所以又提出了“查风立功”运动，领导上的意图，是先查风后立功，从查风中打下立功的基础。查风本身应是查缺点也查优点，优点可以表扬，缺点可以作个清理，求得克服。但执行中形成了只查缺点，不查优点，以及脱离当前中心工作来专门查风立功。实际上立功的本身，即包括了批评与表扬的，先查风后立功的本质，就是先整整你，再叫你立功，仍然是消极的面多，积极的面少，整过去的劲大，看将来的劲小，因此，干部改造和工作的积极性仍未发扬起来。从当前的工作来说，不结合中心工作的查风立功，则会停止了工作的发展，且“功”亦无从立起。
    七地委更进一步深入的检讨了以上经验之后，才总结出了加强思想领导的关键，在于开展立功表模运动。从积极方面去表扬干部，去改造干部，以克服干部脱离群众的现象，提高干部的工作积极性。消极的堵口子、批评、处分，都不能解决问题，而且更限制了群众积极性的发挥与大胆的创造。领导上明确提出“立功表模”之后，干部就普遍反映说：“领导上两只眼睛都睁开了！”一种新的气象呈现了出来。干部思想作风立刻起了很大的变化，立功表模立即形成热潮。
    事实完全证明“立功表模运动”的开展，有力的启发了干部的阶级觉悟，树立了干部全心全意为“人民服务”的思想，并空前的提高了他们的积极性。
    我们应把立功表模运动从上而下，并从下而上的开展起来。这一运动的具体作法，必须是结合当前的工作任务，要定期总结工作、评功表模。有的县份，建立了从县到区的评记功劳委员会，县、区小组都建立“功劳簿”，记载功过和模范事迹，逐渐习惯成为制度，干部功过、模范事迹，管理干部部门要列入鉴定表，存入档案，作为提拔干部的依据。
    “立功表模”的条件，很难具体规定，只能提出奋斗目标，免得弄成主观主义的圈子，束缚运动的开展。冀鲁豫区党委提出的方向是：一、完成任务，并且完成的比别人更好一些；二、工作中能发现新的问题，并有新的创造；三、能带领群众，联系群众，走群众路线。
    模范并非尽善尽美，所以对模范的要求也不能过高，只能是从当时当地的具体情况出发，领导上如能把他比较高出的一点承认起来，他就能起带头作用。
    要注意巩固模范，在模范选出，公开表扬之后，要注意个别教育培养，指出他的弱点，使他继续提高，以免骄傲，脱离群众。切忌选出不管，利用观点。
    领导上应经常开会座谈，使他们作为工作中的方向。模范事迹，及时广播，作为群众学习的榜样。
    干部可以戴罪立功，将功折罪，但不可因罪减功。
    冀鲁豫的立功表模运动，才是普遍开展的始端，但从个别地区的经验中证明：这是积极的方向，这是思想领导的具体化，这是树立我们正确立场、方法的道路。当前的干民关系问题，可以从开展立功表模运动来解决，立功表模运动的开展，可以防止或减少今后这类问题的发生。立功表模的思想领导，我们应肯定他、发扬他。
