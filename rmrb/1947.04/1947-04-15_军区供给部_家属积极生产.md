    Family Members Actively Engage in Production
    [Reported by This Newspaper] The Military Region Supply Department currently has nine cadre family members, all of whom are diligently engaged in production. Since the beginning of February, they have been spinning cotton, sewing quilts, making buttonholes, and spinning string. In less than two months, the nine individuals have produced a total income equivalent to 1,227 catties of rice, averaging over 136 catties per person. Among them, the 67-year-old mother of Director Zheng has achieved the most significant production results, producing the equivalent of 326 catties of rice in less than three months. She has been praised as a model family member, and under her positive influence, there are now no family members who do not participate in production. (Li Naihua)
