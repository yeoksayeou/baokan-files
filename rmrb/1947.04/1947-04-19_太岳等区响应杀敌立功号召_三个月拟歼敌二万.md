　　Taiyue and Other Regions Respond to Call for Killing Enemies and Performing Meritorious Service
　　Three Months Planned to Annihilate 20,000 Enemies

　　[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper] Our troops in Taiyue, Jiluyu, and Jinnan have put forward a plan to annihilate 20,000 enemies in April, May, and June to respond to the call of the Military Region to kill enemies and perform meritorious service. This plan is as follows: Taiyue Region: The Military Region Field Army will annihilate 6,000 enemies, and the Sub-district troops will annihilate 4,750 enemies (including 3,100 of Chiang's regular army and more than 1,600 stubborn miscellaneous troops). The other three sub-districts volunteered to undertake the task of killing 1,800 enemies. In the Jiluyu Region: The Military Region Field Army will annihilate 1,200 enemies, and the sub-districts will annihilate 6,750 enemies. Jinnan Region: The Field Army will complete the annihilation of one regular battalion and two platoons of stubborn troops. A certain unit of the Second Sub-district has automatically proposed that every company participating in combat will completely annihilate one enemy squad each time, and achieve the annihilation of one platoon of enemies in one month. Currently, a certain unit of the Jinnan Field Army has completed the three-month enemy annihilation plan ahead of schedule within the first ten days of the month. On April 10, in a battle at Chuwang, Anyang, they annihilated more than 1,800 Chiang's troops, seizing 2 heavy machine guns, more than 70 light machine guns, and 3 mortars.
