　　Introduction to Armed Village Public Offices
　　Zhu Xiang
　　In the Chiang-occupied and bordering areas along the Taiyue-Tongpu Railway and the Yellow River, armed village public offices have been widely established. Each county has between thirty and fifty, or twenty and thirty, such offices. Some areas (such as Xiangling) have even established armed district public offices. They operate throughout the grid of enemy-occupied points and lines, maintaining and invigorating morale, disrupting the enemy's "maintenance" efforts, enabling democratic decrees to be implemented in the bordering and Chiang-occupied areas, and besieging the enemy within points and lines. This has become an excellent organizational form for our struggle against the enemy.
　　Armed village public offices are organized under the slogans of "organizing a comprehensive package of work" and "one heart." Their organizational forms are broadly divided into two categories: one is based on the village, with the village head, farmers' association chairman, and militia committee director all participating. Each person is both a worker and a combatant. Leadership is specifically divided. When carrying out administrative work, the village head leads, and everyone is a worker. During combat, the militia committee director leads, and everyone is a combatant. When carrying out land reform, the farmers' association chairman leads, and everyone is a liberated peasant. The other organizational form is based on joint defense villages, with key cadres from each village participating and working collectively under the leadership of the armed district public office. When they go to a village, the village head takes the lead, and cadres from other villages carry out work under his leadership. It is a village public office, and also a combat team or a land reform team. It is the head of the people and a thorn in the side of the enemy. In constant struggle, it plays the following important roles:
　　First, because it exists openly, the masses feel that "our government and the Eighth Route Army are still here," which enables the suffering people to see a bright future through the disaster before them. From last winter to January of this year, Beizhang Village in Huoxian County received four threatening letters from the enemy, claiming that if they did not "maintain" the area, they would massacre the entire village. However, encouraged by the armed village public office, they resolutely refused to surrender each time. Although the enemy frantically burned down the houses of the village cadres, they still have not "maintained" the enemy to this day. Under the slogan of "To have a peaceful year, we must kill collaborators," the armed village public office in Hongdong County destroyed a large number of Chiang-Yan regimes. In areas where there are armed village public offices, our decrees are unimpeded, while the enemy's orders cannot leave the strongholds, or even the doors of the碉堡 (diaobao - pillboxes).
　　Second, it eliminates scattered enemies independently and coordinates with local armed forces to annihilate enemy units. The armed village public office uses secret militia as its eyes and ears, often capturing or killing enemies who extort grain and money. When the enemy launches large-scale attacks, it becomes the eyes and ears of the local armed forces. It confuses and monitors the enemy, creating opportunities for local armed forces to eliminate the enemy. In a report to Hu Zongnan, the enemy in Hongdong County said: "We (the enemy referred to themselves) can only play the role of points, not the role of surfaces." Recently, the復仇队 (fuchou dui - revenge squads) in Hongdong, besieged and attacked until they could not survive, fled to Linfen in despair and said: "My god of the door cannot catch tigers!" Under the attack of our armed village public offices and guerrillas, Chiang's stubborn troops have already admitted that they are gods of the door, paper tigers.
　　Third, it protects and leads the masses in the border areas to carry out land reform. The relatively good land reform in the border areas of Jiyuan, Hongdong, Linfen, and Lingshi counties is inseparable from the protection and leadership of the universally established armed village public offices (or command posts). In many places, land reform movements have now been launched directly under the leadership of the armed village public offices.
　　Fourth, the armed village public office is a bridge between the people in the Liberated Areas and the Chiang-occupied areas. For example, people along the Tongpu Railway can take a note from the armed village public office to freely purchase grain in the Liberated Areas. However, spies and bad people cannot obtain this pass. Therefore, the armed village public office has also become an invisible fortress for eliminating spies and preventing espionage in the Liberated Areas.
　　The armed village public office is an excellent organizational form for our struggle in the Chiang-occupied and border areas, and it is worth promoting. However, to make good use of it, we must first overcome certain ideas of simply hiding in ambush or shrinking back and fleeing, so that we can openly raise the banner of democratic power. We should carry forward the heroic spirit of the people of Hongdong: "You (referring to the Chiang army) want four taels from me, I want half a catty from you!" Boldly launch guerrilla warfare and plant our armed village public offices—the banner of democracy—throughout the enemy's heart.

　　武装村公所介绍
    朱襄
    太岳同蒲沿线与黄河沿岸的蒋占区与边沿区，已普遍建立起武装村公所。每县三、五十个到二、三十个不等。有的地区（如襄陵）并建立起武装区公所。他们纵横活动于敌占点线的格子网内，维系与振奋了人心，打断了“维持”，使民主政令通行于边沿区与蒋占区，将敌人围困于点线以内，成为我对敌斗争的一个很好的组织形式。
    武装村公所是在“组织一揽子工作”与“一条心”的口号下组织起来的。其组织形式大体分为两类：一类是以村为单位，村长、农会主席、武委会主任等均参加，配合一部民兵，每人都是工作员，又都是战斗员。领导上具体分工，进行行政工作时，由村长领导，人家都是工作员；战斗时，由武委会主任领导，大家都是战斗员；进行土地改革时，由农会主席领导，大家都是翻身队员。另一种组织形式，是以各个联防村为单位，各村的主要干部参加，在武装区公所领导下，集体工作。走到那村，由那村村长出头，各村干部在他领导下进行工作。它是一个村公所，又是一个战斗组或翻身队。它是人民的首脑部，又是敌人的眼中钉。它在不断的斗争中，起着下面几个重要作用：
    第一、由于它公开存在，群众都觉的“咱的政府和八路军都还在”，这就使苦难的人民能透过眼前灾难看到光明远景。霍县北张村从去冬到今年一月，先后接到敌人四次威胁信，声言如不维持，就要血洗全村；但他们在武装村公所鼓舞下，每次都坚决拒降。虽经敌疯狂将村干部的房子烧光，但直到现在仍未维持敌人。洪洞武装村公所在“要过太平年、必杀协助员”的口号下，大量摧毁蒋阎政权。凡有武装村公所的地区，我之政令均通行无阻，敌之命令则出不了据点，甚至出不了碉堡的大门。
    第二、单独消灭零散敌人，配合地方武装歼灭成股敌人。武装村公所以秘密民兵为耳目，经常活捉或打死摧粮要款的敌人。当敌整股出犯时，它又成为地方兵团的耳目。它迷惑与监视敌人，给地方兵团创造消灭敌人的机会。洪洞敌人给胡宗南的报告中说：“我们（敌自称）只能起点的作用，不能起面的作用”。洪洞的复仇队最近被围困袭击得不能存身，垂头丧气的逃往临汾说：“老子的门神不抓虎！”在我武装村公所与游击队打击下，蒋顽已自认是门神，是纸老虎了。
    第三、掩护与领导边地群众进行土地改革。济源、洪洞、临汾：灵石等县边区的土地改革所以较好，是与他们普遍成立了武装村公所（或称指挥部）的掩护与领导分不开的。许多地方，现已在武装村公所直接领导下展开土地改革运动。
    第四、武装村公所是解放区与蒋占区人民之间的一道桥梁，如同蒲沿线的人民可以拿上武装村公所的条子，到解放区自由购买粮食。但奸细坏人是不能取得这种通行凭证的。所以武装村公所又无形成为解放区除奸防谍的一道堡垒。
    武装村公所是我在蒋占区与边地斗争的一个很好的组织形式，值得发扬；但要很好运用，必须首先克服某些单纯隐蔽埋伏或畏缩逃跑的思想，才能公开的插起民主政权的旗帜。我们应当发扬洪洞人民的英雄气概：“你（指蒋军）要我四两，我要你半斤！”大胆放手的发动游击战争，将我武装村公所——民主旗帜插遍敌人的心脏。
