    Jizhong Shengfang City Defense War
    Our Army Annihilates Nearly Two Thousand Enemies
    Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 19th - The Shengfang City defense war lasted a week from the 8th to the 14th. The Jizhong People's Liberation Army annihilated more than 1,800 invading Chiang Kai-shek troops before proactively withdrawing from the urban area. According to a Jizhong Military Region communique, since the 8th, our People's Liberation Army has inflicted heavy blows on the invading troops in Liuzhuang, Xinan and other places on the periphery of Shengfang. Starting from the 13th, the invading troops, under the command of Mou Tingfang, commander of the 94th Army, launched a fierce attack, and the 151st Brigade was transferred from eastern Hebei, the 157th Brigade from Bohai, and the 116th Division of the 53rd Army from Rongcheng rushed to reinforce them overnight. After inflicting heavy damage on the enemy again, our army transferred to the suburbs on the 14th to await an opportunity to annihilate the enemy. In this battle, a total of more than 1,800 Chiang Kai-shek troops were killed or captured, and ten machine guns and more than 280 rifles were seized. The Chiang Kai-shek army paid such a heavy price only to obtain an empty city.
