Xinhua News Agency, Jin察冀 [Jin Cha Ji] 23rd dispatch: Zhao Zhong, a cooperative hero in Yu County, Jin East, established a war effort transportation cooperative, ensuring that neither war support work nor production is delayed. This cooperative consists of two carts and three oxen from the village cooperative, as well as one refugee and a donkey who fled from the Jiang-controlled area of Shouyang, forming two sets of carts. It is stipulated that cart drivers receive the same treatment as ordinary workers, and in addition to the cooperative providing fodder for the livestock, the cooperative also pays wages to one person in charge of them. Except for stretcher-bearing duties, all the logistical support that the village needs to provide can be handled by the carts, unless it is a large-scale engagement. Most of the time, the carts can be used for coal transportation and production. The daily earnings from production are enough to cover two days of expenses, and the cooperative is more than self-sufficient. In this way, except for stretcher-bearing duties, the entire village's labor force does not need to be dispatched, and can fully devote themselves to agricultural and sideline production during the lulls in the war. Duzikou Village in the same county also recently established a similar organization called the Service Cooperative, which is formed by the entire village contributing cotton shares according to labor power. The cooperative transports the cotton to Wutai for sale, buys back four donkeys, three for logistical support, and one for transportation and production, using the profits to cover the expenses of the people and animals engaged in logistical support. The production of the families tending the donkeys is taken care of by the whole village through labor exchange. In this way, the past phenomena of chaotic support work affecting production in the village has been overcome.

    不误支差又能生产
    盂县创战勤运输社
    【新华社晋察冀二十三日电】晋东盂县合作英雄赵忠，创办战勤运输社，使战勤工作与生产两不耽误。该社系由村合作社之大车两辆，牛三头，及由寿阳蒋管区逃来的一个难民和毛驴一头组成两套大车，规定车夫按普通工人待遇，牲口除由社供给草料外亦接一人由社付给工资。全村应出之勤务除担架外，只要不是大规模的参战，完全可由大车运送，大部时间尚可作运煤生产。而生产一日所获足够两日开支，该社尚能自给有余。如此除担架外，全村劳力可以不出差，抓住战争空隙全部投入农副业生产。该县独自口村亦于最近成立了一类似性质的组织，名勤务合作社，系由全村按劳力集棉花股一部而成，由社将棉花运往五台出卖后买回四头毛驴，三头支差，一头运输生产，以获利供给支差人畜费用，而赶驴人家中的生产则由全村变工照顾。如此该村过去勤务混乱影响生产的现象即被克服。
