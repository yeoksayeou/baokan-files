　　Ji'nan Third Administrative Office Issues Order to Counties and Districts
    Rectify Village Finances
    [Our newspaper, Ji'nan, 30th] In response to the call for economy, the Third Administrative Office has issued a special order to the county governments and district offices to rectify village finances and reduce the burden on the people. 1. Establish military reception stations on major thoroughfares. All passing military and government personnel must eat at the reception stations. No other villages are allowed to provide meals, and grain coupons must be given according to the regulations. 2. Strict control of conscription is required. For example, when militia go on expeditions, vehicles are used, or stretchers are needed, they should be dispatched by the Military Affairs Committee, and the expenses should be paid by the public. No one is allowed to ask the villagers for anything before or after departure. 3. Village finances are not allowed to collect grain and money without the approval of the district. 4. Militia bullets should be issued uniformly by the Military Affairs Committee, and bullet expenses should not be levied from the villagers. 5. In addition to the stipulated grain, firewood, and office expenses, primary school teachers are not allowed to ask the villagers for anything else. 6. When cadres go to work in the villages, they must eat with the households and give grain coupons or write receipts according to the regulations. Grain will be returned at the end of the month when accounts are settled; otherwise, it will be regarded as corruption.
