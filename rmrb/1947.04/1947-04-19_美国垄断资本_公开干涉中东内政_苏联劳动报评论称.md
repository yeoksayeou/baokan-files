　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th: TASS, Moscow: Surnov recently published an article in Labor Newspaper commenting on Truman's message on aid to Greece and Turkey, stating: This message has caused surprise among progressive people in Near Eastern countries, who believe it is an indication of the United States' attempt to seize economic positions and military bases in the Near East and the Mediterranean. Democrats believe that this is the United States' open interference in the internal affairs of other countries. Newspapers in many countries have also pointed out that this is a manifestation of the behind-the-scenes influence of American oil monopoly capital on the new trend in American policy. Near Eastern countries have long attracted the attention of American monopoly capital. Since the Second World War, the number of American capitalists invading Near Eastern countries has increased. American capital has poured into Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Kuwait, Egypt, Turkey, and Bahrain. The United States is using the characteristics of the current situation to weaken British imperialism in the region. This has angered the British imperialist group, who clearly see that their overseas "cousins" are trying to squeeze them out. However, Britain has been weakened financially and politically by the war and cannot resist the American capital invading the Near East. In addition, Britain is also terrified of the growth of the Near Eastern national liberation movement. In order to maintain its position in the Near East, it has agreed to cooperate with American monopoly capital and conclude agreements with it to jointly exploit the oil resources of the Near East. First, Turkey is a convenient market for American merchants to sell manufactured goods and purchase raw materials. Second—and this is the main argument of the United States—Turkey occupies an important strategic position at the intersection of routes to the Middle East and Near Eastern countries in the Mediterranean. President Truman's message is to further strengthen the United States' position in the Near East. The agreement to build a large oil pipeline across Arabia is for the same purpose. Recently, the United States has repeatedly clamored about their "cultural mission" in the Near East, "to help the hard-working people of these countries." Americans use newspapers, photographs, radio, and run schools, and print a large number of books and pamphlets "praising" American "democracy" to promote their "good intentions." In American-run schools in the Arab world, Americans boast about their respect for the sovereignty of small countries and democratic freedom, while American monopoly capital is described as helping the development of local national economies. In reality, however, American Cadres are carrying out colonial exploitation in the Near Eastern countries. Americans not only carry out economic exploitation, but they also frequently interfere in the political life of Near Eastern countries. Most of these interventions are carried out in disguised forms. The Lebanese "Danmar Newspaper" quoted such an interesting example, saying: "An American company has set up a bureau in Beirut to recruit workers to open up oil pipelines in Lebanese territory. Applicants are questioned about the political groups they have joined, their nationalities, etc. They are also asked who they voted for in the last election and who they will vote for in the next election. "Under the pathetic tones of American propaganda of 'democracy,' the Arab News Bureau in Washington was recently searched by the American police. The Bureau has repeatedly criticized American policies in the Near East, especially in Palestine." The author concludes that the expansion of the United States in the Near East is increasingly turning to open interference in economic and political life. In this light, the surprise of democrats in the Middle East and Near Eastern countries at Truman's message is quite understandable.

　　美国垄断资本
    公开干涉中东内政
    苏联劳动报评论称
    【新华社陕北十三日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏尔诺夫顷在劳动报著文评论杜鲁门援助希、土咨文称：此咨文已在近东国家进步人士中引起惊讶，咸认此系美国企图在近东与地中海攫取经济地位与军事基地的表示。民主人士认为这是美国公开干涉他国内政。许多国家的报纸同样指出：这是美国石油垄断资本的幕后势力，在美国政策上新趋势的表露。近东国家很久以来就吸引了美国垄断资本的注意。第二次世界大战以来，侵入近东国家的美国资本家已增加。美国资本已冲入沙特阿拉伯、伊拉克、科威特、埃及、土耳其及巴林岛等地。美国利用当前局势的特点去削弱英帝国主义。该区域的地位。这触怒了英帝国主义集团，他们看得很清楚，海外的“堂兄弟”正竭力要将他们挤出去。但是英国在财政上和政治上都已为战争所削弱，不能抗御侵入近东的美国资本。此外，英国又骇怕近东民族解放运动的成长，为了保有她在近东的地位，就同意与美国垄断资本合作，并与它缔结协定，来共同榨取近东的石油资源。首先，土耳其就是美国商人销售制成品与购买原料的方便市场。其次——这是美国的主要议论——土耳其在地中海上据有中东与近东各国通道交叉点上重要的战略位置，杜鲁门总统的咨文即在进一步加强美国在近东的地位。建造横贯阿拉伯的大油管线的协定也是为了相同的目的。最近美国一再地嚷着他们在近东的“文化使命”，“要帮助这些国家的劳苦人民。”美国人利用报纸、照片、无线电并办学校，和印刷大批“颂扬”美国“民主”的书籍与小册子，以鼓吹他们的“好意”。阿拉伯的美立学校中，美国人大肆吹嘘他们尊重小国的主权，和民主自由，而美国垄断资本则被描述为要帮助地方国民经济的发展。然而实际上，美国加迭尔却在近东各国进行着殖民地的剥削。美国人不仅作经济剥削，他们更经常干涉近东国家的政治生活。这些干涉大部分都是在伪装的形式下进行的。黎巴嫩的“丹马尔报”引用这类有趣的例子说：“美国公司在贝鲁特设局招聘工人，在黎巴嫩领土上开辟油管线。应聘工人要被盘问所加入的政治团体，及国籍……………等，还盘问他们在上次选举中选的谁，下次选举要选谁。在美国宣扬“民主”的可怜音调下，华盛顿的阿拉伯新闻局最近即遭到美国警察的搜查，该局曾一再批评过美国在近东，尤其是在巴勒斯坦的政策”。著者得出结论说：美国在近东的扩张日益转向对经济与政治生活的公开干涉，这样看来，中东、近东各国民主人士对杜鲁门咨文的惊讶就十分明白了。
