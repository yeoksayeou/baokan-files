[Jinan Dispatch from Our Newspaper, 10th] The movement to oppose traitors and oppose "retribution" in the recovered areas of Daming has been widely launched. In the Third District, in a total of sixty-three villages, the masses in twenty-one villages have recovered their property from the landlords who engaged in "retribution." In the urban area, the masses recovered a total of 192 items of property from twelve landlords who engaged in "retribution." Of the 29 streets in the city, mass organizations have been restored in 20 streets, with 1,705 male and female members. Adding the members of the Children's Corps and Sisters' Corps, organized members account for about two-thirds of the total population. After Chiang's puppet regime fled south, the masses urgently demanded revenge due to the brutal and inhumane acts of Chiang's puppet troops and lawless landlords. However, because Chiang's puppet strongholds remained in Anyang, Chuwang, and Huilong, the masses feared the enemy would return again. In addition, the people suffered severely from disasters, and village cadres and their families were unable to maintain their livelihoods, urgently demanding production. Therefore, the actions also showed the following: (1) There was a demand to oppose "retribution," but no one was willing to step forward. (2) They believed that the landlords had fled, leaving little property at home. Even if some were retrieved, it would not be as good as solving the problem through production. (3) The masses in individual villages that suffered less damage were willing to have no further dealings with the landlords in the future, with mutual non-aggression. Based on the above situation, the anti-traitor movement in Daming was carried out in conjunction with the following work: (1) Arouse the masses' hatred and boost their morale through denouncing Chiang Kai-shek and accusing him of crimes. Break the masses' thinking that "the world is changing." (2) The government, based on the opinions of the masses, issued an order to arrest the evil landlords and confiscated their property. It called on the landlords hiding in the countryside to repent and start anew to the government and the masses, and the evil atmosphere was immediately suppressed. (3) Organize the masses for production through relief and assistance. In the urban area alone, a total of 7 million yuan was loaned. Currently, 3,000 spinning wheels, 400 looms, and 300 cigarette factories have been organized. One-third of the masses in the city who had no food to eat due to enemy disasters solved their food problem through production, and then brewed connections to organize, quickly taking action.

　　控诉蒋军恶政
    提高群众斗志
    大名新收复区群运开展
    【本报冀南十日电】大名收复区的反奸、反“倒算”运动，已普遍开展。三区共六十三个村庄，已有二十一个村的群众从“倒算”地主手中，收回了自己的财物。市区的群众，从十二户“倒算”地主手中，共收回财物一百九十二件，全市共二十九条街，群众组织已恢复二十条街，现有男女会员一千七百零五人，再加上儿童团员及姐妹团员，约有组织成员的三分之二。蒋伪南窜后，由于蒋伪军与不法地主惨绝人性的暴行，群众迫切要求报复，但因安阳、楚旺、回龙等地仍有蒋伪据点，群众怕敌人再次返回；加以人民受灾严重，村干部与群众家庭生活无法维持，急于要求生产。因此在行动上也表现出：（一）有反“倒算”的要求，但谁也不愿出头。（二）认为地主逃跑，家中所留财物无几，即便倒回一些，亦不如生产解决问题。（三）个别受害轻的村庄群众，愿与地主今后两方无事，互不侵犯。根据上述情况，大名反奸运动即结合以下工作进行：（一）从反蒋控诉中，启发群众仇恨，提高其斗志。打破群众“变天”思想。（二）政府根据群众意见，明令通缉作恶地主，并没收其财产，对潜藏四乡的地主，号召其向政府与群众悔过自新，邪气马上被镇压下去。（三）从抚恤救济中组织群众生产，仅市区共贷款七百万元。现组织起纺花车三千辆，织布机四百架，卷烟厂三百家。全市三分之一因遭敌灾没饭吃的群众，从生产中解决了吃饭问题后，就酝酿串连组织，很快就行动起来。
