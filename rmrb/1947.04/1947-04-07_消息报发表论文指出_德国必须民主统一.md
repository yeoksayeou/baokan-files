Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, April 4th. TASS dispatch: *Izvestia* published an article by Academician Yevgeny Tarle, titled "The Future of Germany and European Security," which stated in brief:

　　From the viewpoint of lasting European peace, which is better: a unified Germany or a "federalized" Germany in any form? Some believe in "federalization," but we believe that so-called "federalization" only satisfies those who cultivate the remnants of Nazism, because if the German problem is solved by dividing the defeated nation, then a brief and illusory "satisfaction" will cause the Allied nations to pay a heavy price in the future.

　　Many concrete signs prove that some people are currently trying to use the concept of unification to conduct "patriotic" activities. Kurt Schumacher, notorious for his evil deeds, is a good example. Others deliberately equate the concept of "unification" with the concept of "centralization." The unified Germany that we advocate is by no means Hitler's fascist "centralization," but rather a centralized, thoroughly democratized Germany established with the effective participation and constant control of the victorious nations; its role can prevent conflicts between the "West" and the "East" and disappoint those who incite "World War III."

　　Those who, under the pretext of "stabilizing Europe," want to make Germany a divided nation under "federalization" are trying to keep Nazism unharmed and allow the defeated Germany of Nazism to continue to exist. The irrational judgments of German courts have released, or almost released, Nazi war criminals with bloodstained hands. Without a Germany that has truly eliminated the remnants of Nazism, is thoroughly democratized, truly strictly controlled, and completely disarmed, Europe does not and cannot have lasting security.

　　消息报发表论文指出
  　德国必须民主统一
    【新华社陕北四日电】塔斯社讯：消息报发表科学院会员伊维根里塔里一文：题为“德国之将来与欧洲安全”，略谓：
    从欧洲永久和平之观点看来，统一之德国与在任何形式下“联邦化”之德国，究以何者为佳？有些人认为是“联邦化”，我们认为所谓“联邦化”只是满足了那些培植纳粹残余的人们，因为如果以分割战败国的方法来解决德国问题，那么，短暂及虚幻的“满意”，将使盟国将来付出重大之代价的。
    许多确实的征象，证明了目前一些人想利用统一的观念，以作“爱国”的活动。恶名昭彰的刻特·舒马区就是一个好例子。另一些人故意把“统一”的概念，说成“集权”的概念。我们所主张的统一德国绝不是希特勒的法西斯“集权”，而是由战胜国有效地参加，及在其经常管制之下建立起来的，并且它还须还集权的、彻底民主化的；它的作用能以防止“西方”与“东方”冲突。并给那些“三次大战”的煽动者，以失望。
    那些以“安定欧洲”为借口，想使德国在“联邦化”之下，成为分裂的人，他们正努力使纳粹主义不受损害，并使纳粹主义战败的德国继续存在。德国法院非理的判决，释放或几乎释放了那些满手血腥的纳粹战犯。没有一个真正的清除了纳粹残余、彻底的民主化、真正严格的管制、完全解除武装的德国，欧洲是没有而且也不能有巩固的安全的。
