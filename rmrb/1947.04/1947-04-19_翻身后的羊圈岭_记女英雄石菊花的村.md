Sheepfold Ridge is a natural village in the fourth district of Yushe, jointly managed by several villages. The whole village consists of sixteen households with sixty-three people. It is the village of first-class hero Shi Juhua. Decades ago, there were only two families, Wang and Li, who relied entirely on renting land for a living, directly subjected to the rule and exploitation of landlord Tian Yanwang of Jiangtang (a nickname local people used for the brothers of landlord Tian Afang. People called his brothers Second Yanwang and Third Yanwang). Their land was often seized, so the two tenant families couldn't stay in one place for long, changing every few years. Later, it gradually grew to eight households, but they still relied entirely on renting land and didn't own an acre themselves. The eight households together rented two to three hundred mu of thin land on the landlord's hillside, paying eighty-five shi of rent each year. Sometimes the landlord would unreasonably increase the rent, so after a year of labor, they still had nothing to eat, all of it exploited by the landlord. Therefore, they were often in a state of hunger and cold. The family of hero Shi Juhua was a typical example. Originally, his father-in-law was forced to come here from another village with only three sheng of millet. After arriving, the father reclaimed land and planted on the mountain, the mother cut wheat for others. The father labored all day, and when others ate, he had to endure hunger because he had nothing to eat himself. He would carry wheat for others in exchange for a meal and then go back to work for himself. At night, he returned to his broken cave empty-handed, suffering from cold and hunger all night. Sometimes, even with the moonlight, he suffered day and night. Even so, he often only had chaff and wild herbs to eat. The mother often begged for food. Once, she didn't see clearly and mistook dog feces for black zheng (a local food in Yushe). When planting, they had no livestock. Juhua and her mother-in-law went to the field to pull the plow, using themselves as oxen. Under the cruel exploitation of the landlord, they still couldn't make a living even with such labor. As Juhua's husband said, "I have suffered too much, I can't even begin to describe it. I fall down and get up, then fall down again, it's been so painful!" And almost all the eight households in the village lived such lives.

    After the start of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Eighth Route Army arrived, and the peasants here began to turn themselves around after the implementation of the rent reduction and interest rate reduction policy. From changing large dou to small dou for rent reduction, and after the 25% rent reduction, they had a little way to survive. After the thorough rent reduction in 1942, the peasants began to buy land and livestock. Two-thirds of the three hundred mu of land became the property of the peasants. After the land reform last year, all the past rented land has completely become the peasants' own, and they have also been allocated more than sixty mu, and newly bought more than one hundred mu. Now the sixteen households in the village have a total of five hundred and twenty mu of land, with an average of seven mu per person, fully realizing "land to the tiller." There is one new rich peasant, thirteen new middle peasants, and two old middle peasants. There are no impoverished people. The whole village has ten large and small oxen and more than one hundred sheep. In the past, most peasants did not have wives. Since the War of Resistance, twelve of the seventeen peasants who did not have wives have found them. Moreover, in the past three or four years, twelve lively and healthy children have been born. With land, oxen, and wives, they don't worry about food or clothing and are very happy.

    Last year's production movement, under the leadership of hero Shi Juhua, achieved a yield of more than ten for one in the whole village. In the three months of winter production, they earned more than 100,000 yuan. Women also actively participate in labor and weaving. Of the eighteen women in the village, sixteen, excluding two sick ones, formed a large group, divided into two subgroups, and engaged in weaving year-round without neglecting farm work. There is not a single idler in the village. This year, in order to save labor, the whole village plans to eat in a common pot, with four women taking turns on duty each day, while other women specialize in weaving or helping in the fields. The peasants in the village are united and happy, presenting a new atmosphere, symbolizing the new socialist countryside. When you meet the peasants here, they are full of smiles, revealing the happiness and joy of life. They also treat the Eighth Route Army and cadres with great enthusiasm, as close as family. The peasants' minds are also greatly different from the past. They tell people, "Comparing the past to the present, we are truly satisfied with the good times." Peasant Li Erhuo said: "In the past, we were stubborn, but after receiving the benefits of rent reduction and interest rate reduction and emancipation, we really understood. Who is without a heart! In the past, we planted three generations of rented land for others, and we couldn't even buy a piece of land. At that time, not to mention seizing someone else's land, we couldn't even be in arrears with the rent! Later, the burden gradually lightened. When we were emancipated, we got whatever we could. In the past, the landlord had wine pots and meat dishes during the New Year. It was New Year for them, but a disaster for us! This year's New Year is different. We have wheat to eat, and we can even eat some meat. Those landlords and Chiang Kai-shek and his dog day... let them try to bully us again, and see if we won't destroy them!"

　　翻身后的羊圈岭
    记女英雄石菊花的村
    李芾棠
    羊圈岭是榆社四区共有编村的一个自然村，全村十六户六十三口人，系一等英雄石菊花所在村，几十年前只有王李二姓两户，全靠租地为生，直接受讲堂地主田阎王（当地群众叫地主田阿芳弟兄的绰号。群众叫他弟兄们是二阎王三阎王）的统治剥削，土地常被剥夺，因此两家佃户也不能固定存在，过几年换几户。以后逐渐发展到八户，仍是全靠租地，自己没有一亩土地。八户共租地主山坡薄地二三百亩，每年出租八十五石，有时地主还要无理增租，因此劳动一年结果还是没有吃的，都被地主剥削去了，所以经常处于饥寒交迫的生活中。英雄石菊花的家庭就是一个典型。原来他公公从它乡被迫来这里时，只带有三升小米，来了以后父亲开荒种山，母亲给人割麦父亲整天劳动，到别人吃饭时，因自己没吃的，只好忍着饿，在别人吃饭时他给人家担麦换吃一顿饭，然后再去给自己劳动，晚上回到破窑洞里一无所有，整夜的受冻受饿，有时有月亮时夜里白天连着受，就是这样也是经常吃糠吃菜。母亲常问人要饭吃，一次没看清把狗粪当成了黑蒸（榆社一种食物土名）。养种时没有牲口，菊花和他婆婆上地拉犁，当牛使用，在地主残酷的剥削下，这样劳动也是活不出来，正如菊花男人说，我的苦太多了，说也说不完，跌倒起来，起来跌倒，可受罪啦！而全村八户中差不多都是过着这样的生活。
    抗战开始，八路军来到，减租减息政策执行后，这里的农民才开始翻身。从大斗改小斗的减租，及二五减租后，稍稍有了活路，再经过四二年彻底减租，农民就开始买地买牲口，三百余亩地三分之二变成农民所有。去年土地改革后，现在所有过去的租地完全变成了农民的，而且又分到六十余亩，新买到百余亩。现在全村十六户共有土地五百二十亩，平均每人有地七亩，完全实现了耕者有其田，一户新富农，十三户新中农，两户旧中农，没有一个赤贫。全村有了大小耕牛十头，羊子一百余只。过去大部农民没有老婆，抗战以后十七个没有老婆的农民，已有了十二个，而且在近三四年来又生下了十二个活泼健壮的小孩，有了土地，有了耕牛，又有了老婆，不愁吃，不愁穿，十分愉快。
    去年的生产运动在英雄石菊花领导下全村达到了耕十余一，冬季生产三个月赚洋十万余元。妇女也积极参加劳动纺织，全村十八个妇女，除两个病人外十六个妇女组成了一个大组，分两小组活动，常年不误纺织，也不误上地劳动。村里没有一个闲人。今年全村为了节省劳力，准备合锅吃饭，每日四个妇女轮流值日，其他妇女专门纺织或上地帮忙，全村农民团结愉快，呈现着一种新的气象，象征着新社会的农村，这里的农民你一见他就满面笑容，流露着生活的幸福和愉快。他们对八路军和干部，也以极大的热情相处，亲切的如一家人一样。农民的脑筋和过去也大大的不同了，他们给人说，想想过去来比现在，过好的时光真是心满意足。农民李二货说：“过去咱是顽固脑筋，自得到减租减息和翻身的利益后，可真明白啦，那个人没心！过去咱种了人家三辈租子地，就连一块地也买不下，那时候不用说搞人家的地，租子欠下也不行！以后担子慢慢就减轻了，翻身没甚能分甚，过去过年地主是酒壶肉碟，人家是过年，咱是过灾啦！今年过年不同了，有了麦子吃，还要吃些肉。地主跟老蒋狗日的他看，他敢再来欺负咱们，看咱不毁了他们！”
