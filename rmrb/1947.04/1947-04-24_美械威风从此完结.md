    The reason Chiang Kai-shek relies on fighting the civil war is American equipment. American imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek are both superstitious about the omnipotence of American equipment. In addition to arming dozens of American-equipped divisions, they also organized two rapid columns. It is said that they were the most highly mechanized troops. With this American equipment, Chiang Kai-shek would definitely win the war.
    However, when the war started, the American-equipped divisions were annihilated by the People's Liberation Army in the same way as the non-American-equipped divisions. The most ridiculous thing is that the two so-called "rapid columns" are sure to be wiped out as soon as they fight. The first "rapid column" was eliminated the fastest, it was finished in January this year; then the second rapid column was also completely wiped out in northern Henan. "Rapid column" has become "rapid elimination," and the prestige of American equipment has been swept away.
    It seems that in order to make its troops be eliminated more slowly, Chiang Kai-shek will not organize any more "rapid columns" but will organize "slow columns" in the future.

    美械威风从此完结
    蒋介石打内战靠的是美械，美帝国主义和蒋介石都迷信美械万能。除武装了几十个美械师以外，还组织了两个快速纵队。据说：是最高度的机械化部队；靠了这些美械装备，蒋介石一定能打胜仗。
    可是打起仗来的时候，美械师与非美械师一样的被人民解放军所消灭。顶可笑的是两个所谓“快纵”，不打仗则已，一打仗一定消灭。第一“快纵”消灭得第一快，在今年一月就完蛋了；接着第二个快纵也在豫北全部被消灭了。“快纵”变成了“快消灭”，美械的威风从此扫地。
    看来蒋介石为了使它的部队慢点被消灭起见，以后不会再组织什么“快纵”而要组织“慢纵”了。
