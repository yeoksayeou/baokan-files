　　Yan Xishan's Executioners
　　Massacring Peasants
　　[This newspaper, Taiyue, 2nd dispatch] The Yan army in Pingyao has begun to carry out bloody massacres in its occupied areas. Many kind-hearted peasants who were lured into "confessing" have been brutally murdered on the pretext of "colluding with bandits." On the 11th of this month alone, 25 peasants were brutally murdered in the city and in the three villages of Liangcun and Jincun. Nine people were chopped into three pieces with grass-cutting knives. One young man was arrested twice by the Yan army. The first two times, he sold off his family property to redeem himself. This time, he was arrested again, and because he had no "money to buy his life," he was murdered before the fourth day. At the time of the massacre, the executioners said, "You have no money to buy your life, go back to your hometown." Many people who were deceived are now waking up and fleeing back to the liberated areas. They say, "The Gouzi army is not human. Whoever 'confesses' is burying themselves!"

　　阎锡山刽子手
    大批屠杀农民
    【本报太岳二日电】平遥阎军已开始在其侵占区实行血腥大屠杀，许多被诱惑而“自白”了的良善农民，都借以“通匪”的罪名被惨杀。只本月十一日一天，城内和梁村金村三处被惨杀的农民即达二十五人，九人用铡草刀铡成三截；一个青年曾被阎军抓去两次，前两次把家产变卖完赎回来，这次又被抓去，因为没有“买命钱”，所以等不到第四日便被屠杀了。惨杀时刽子手们说：“你没有钱买命了，回老家吧。”现有很多被骗上当的人，都觉悟起来，逃回解放区。他们说：“勾子军不算人，谁‘自白’就是自埋！”
