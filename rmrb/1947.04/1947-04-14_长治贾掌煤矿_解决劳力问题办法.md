　　Changzhi Jiazhang Coal Mine
    Solutions to the Labor Shortage Problem

　　Since Changzhi Jiazhang Coal Mine started producing coal in the "July 1st" [likely referring to the anniversary of the CCP] last year, there has been a serious shortage of underground workers. It was not until January of this year that the workers themselves suggested: finding workers should be everyone's responsibility, and it is possible to find them. The leadership accepted the workers' suggestions and took this as a condition for striving for a model team. After that, workers went home to mobilize during their rest periods, bringing back old workmates who had worked in the mine with them in the past, reaching eighty or ninety people per shift. Regarding the issues of workers being called back to the village for errands and burdens, in the past, when a village had errands to run, workers were always called back, even for small tasks like guarding and patrolling. Some workers who didn't want to return hired replacements. Regarding the burden issue, in some villages, it was calculated based on the total income of the workers' wages, so the burden amount was very large. Workers felt that after paying for burdens and hiring replacements for errands, they weren't earning enough, and it was better to simply go home. Based on this situation, the mine held a meeting of village cadres from nearby villages, first soliciting opinions on the mine, and raising this issue. After everyone discussed it, it was decided that: for errands, small tasks would not be assigned; for burdens, they would be determined based on the worker's family situation. For example, in Jiazhang, burdens were calculated at different rates such as one-tenth, two-tenths, three-tenths and four-tenths, and the workers were satisfied, and the masses understood the situation.

　　Regarding the issue of labor exchange between workers and peasants, it was resolved through joint worker-peasant meetings in each village. It was stipulated that peasants who farmed for workers would receive two more jin of millet per workday than in labor exchanges between peasants. For example, if the wage for labor exchange between peasants was four sheng of millet per workday, the wage for peasants helping workers would be six sheng of millet per workday. This satisfied both parties. The peasants felt that one day of work for the workers was equivalent to one and a half days of work for other peasants. The workers felt that although they were paying two more sheng of millet per day, they earned one dou and one sheng for each shift in the mine, still earning five sheng. In addition, in order to strengthen the relationship between the mine and the countryside, the mine took the initiative to help the countryside, so that the masses in the villages felt that the mine was helping their village, and in turn, they should also help the mine. Jiazhang Coal Mine provides a certain amount of coal to the village public office and for public affairs in the village to help them. (Shen Zhixian)

　　长治贾掌煤矿
    解决劳力问题办法
    长治贾掌煤矿自去年“七一”出煤以来，窑底工人非常缺乏。直到今年一月工人们自动提出：找工人要大家负责，还是可以找来的。领导上接受了工人们的意见，并以此为争取模范班的一个条件。此后工人休息时便回家动员，把过去和自己在一块下过窑的老工友都动员来了，达到每班都有八九十人下窑。对于工人支差和负担问题，过去有个村有差时，必叫工人回去，甚至一些站岗放哨等勤务，也要让工人回去，有些工人不回去，就雇人代替。还有负担问题，有个别村，按工人工资数的总收入来计算，所以负担数目很大。工人感到连负担带雇工人支差，赚的还不够，不如索性回家好一些。根据这样情况，矿厂召开了附近村干部会议，先征求对矿上的意见，提出这一问题，经大家研究后定出：支差方面，小的勤务不支；负担方面，是根据工人的家庭情况而定。如贾掌在算负担时，分一二分三四分不等，这样一来，工人也满意，群众思想也通了。
    关于工农变工问题，是经过各村工农联席会议解决的。规定农民给工人种地，比农民与农民变工工资米多二斤。如农民与农民变工每工小米四升，农民给工人互助，每工工资米即六升，这样两方都满意。农民感到自己给工人作一天工，顶给农民作一天半。工人方面感到自己虽一天多出二升米，但自己下班窑就赚一斗一升，还要赚五升。此外为了加强矿上与农村的关系，矿上主动的帮助农村，使村里群众感到矿上对自己村上有帮助，反过来自己也应当帮助人家。贾掌煤矿对村公所及村上办一些公共事，都给送一定数量的煤帮助他们。（申志贤）
