　　Earnest Expectations
    Soliciting Opinions from All Sectors for the Newspaper's Anniversary
    The upcoming first anniversary of our newspaper's founding – May 15th – should be a time for the newspaper itself to review its past work, summarize its experiences, and strive for improvement and enhancement, so that the newspaper can further connect with the masses, connect with reality, and play a greater role in the cause of serving the people. In order to make this review and summary better, and to truly make it the foundation for improving our work in the future, we earnestly expect comrades in Party, government, military, and civilian work throughout the region, comrades in cultural work, elementary school teachers, comrades who are correspondents for this newspaper, and the broad readership who care for this newspaper to actively offer your hopes and constructive opinions for the newspaper. Please specifically provide information on which aspects of the newspaper in the past were good and should be enhanced, and which have shortcomings and should be improved. Individual or collective contributions are welcome; the format is not limited, whether in the form of letters or articles. In order to widely collect opinions, we especially hope that our newspaper's correspondents can collect opinions on behalf of others. If conditions permit, try to convene small informal discussion meetings to collect more opinions. We will open a special column to disclose them gradually, and plan to publish a special edition on the anniversary; we will also improve the newspaper and improve our work based on these opinions.
    Please send letters and manuscripts directly to the Communications and Liaison Section of this newspaper.
