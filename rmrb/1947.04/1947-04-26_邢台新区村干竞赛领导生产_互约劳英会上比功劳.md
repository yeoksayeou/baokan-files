The Xingtai New District convened a production mobilization conference of over six thousand people, including party members, cadres, militia, activists, emancipated heroes, representatives of the emancipated, military family members, middle peasants, and women. (1) Farmers throughout the county enthusiastically responded to the Party's policies and Chairman Mao's path of "getting rich through organization." Zhang Fengrong, chairman of the Farmers' Association of Li Dao Village in the Second District, said: "In the past, I thought the Eighth Route Army loved the poor and did not love the rich, but now I realize that it loves the rich but not exploitation, and loves the poor who were exploited in the past, but not the poor who do not work after being emancipated." The village chief of ××× Village in the Sixth District said: "During the emancipation movement, I followed Chairman Mao's path and became an emancipation hero, wearing Chairman Mao's image. After listening to Political Commissar Guo's report today, I realized that I am lazy and have not followed Chairman Mao's path of production. I am not worthy of wearing Chairman Mao's image. I will only be worthy of wearing Chairman Mao's image after I become a labor hero in the autumn." Some also said: If we don't produce, we will let Chairman Mao down; some said that if we don't work, we are not worthy of being cadres; others said that we will compare our contributions when we meet at the next labor hero meeting. A middle peasant from ××× Village in the First District said: "Today I realized that struggle is for great production, and labor production is glorious. In the past, I was afraid of struggle because I was scaring myself. This time, when I go back, I will not only work and produce myself, but also persuade all the middle peasants to work and produce." Shen Chunlian, a military family member from Xiaochang Village in the Second District, said: "In the past, I thought that if men joined the army, they could just sit at home and wait to be fed and clothed. Today, after listening to Chairman Mao's and the Communist Party's policies, I will go back and work hard. Not only will I work, but I will also call on all military family members to participate in labor. Without labor production, we cannot defeat Chiang Kai-shek's offensive." (2) Recognizing that labor production is the most glorious. Fu Xitu from Duizigou in the Sixth District said: "In the past, I was a farmhand for a landlord when I was thirteen years old, plowing the fields and leading the livestock. The landlord's children were seventeen years old and were not allowed to go near the livestock. The lives of the poor were worthless. Now that we have been emancipated and married wives, we don't want to work and want to live the life of a landlord, because in the past, if we didn't work for a day, we had nothing to eat." Yang Xiuyi, the village chief of Shixiang Village in the Second District, said: "In the past, I worked as a laborer in Zhaocheng, Shanxi. I couldn't wear cotton clothes in winter, and my feet were chapped, but I still worked for the landlord. Now that I have been emancipated, I am not even willing to carry a load of water. In the future, I will resolutely engage in labor production, secure our Jiangshan, and strive for honor instead of steamed buns." Yin Liude, the village chief of Wuzhong Village in the Third District, said: "I worked as a farmhand for a landlord for twenty years. I often thought about when I could cultivate a few acres of land myself, and I would cultivate it well. After being emancipated and having land, I don't want to work." In the end, everyone realized that in the past, they worked for the landlords, but now they work for themselves, and that labor is the most glorious, while not working is a disgrace. (3) On the basis of the idea of getting rich, an accounting movement was launched. Wang Jinghua from Jiazi Dun in the Second District did not work hard. In the past, she could harvest eighteen sacks of grain every year, but last year she only harvested seven sacks, losing four hundred thousand yuan in one year. Someone from Jinci Village in the First District said: "In the past, I could weave ten reed mats a day, but now I only weave two a day, losing four hundred thousand yuan in one month." After accounting, everyone felt that they had to work hard. (Guo Fengshan, Han Yaoxi, Zhang Jüzhu)

　　邢台新区村干竞赛领导生产
    互约劳英会上比功劳
    【本报邢台讯】邢台新区召开党员干部民兵积极分子翻身英雄翻身代表军属中农妇女等六千余人的生产动员大会。（一）全县农民热烈响应党的政策及毛主席组织起来“发家致富”的道路。二区李道村农会主席张凤荣说：“我过去认为八路军是爱穷人，不爱富人，现在才认识是爱富人不爱剥削，是爱过去受剥削的穷人，不爱翻身后不劳动之穷人。”六区×××村村长说：“我在翻身运动中已走了毛主席的路，当了翻身英雄，带上毛主席的像。今天听了郭政委的报告，才明白我好吃懒做，没有走上毛主席生产的路，我不配带毛主席的像，等秋后当上劳动英雄才配带毛主席的像。”还有人说：不生产就对不住毛主席，有的说不劳动就不配当干部，也有的说等下次开劳动英雄会咱见面比功吧。一区×××村中农说：“我今天才知道斗争是为了大生产，劳动生产是光荣的，过去怕斗争是自己吓唬自己，我这次回去，不但自己劳动生产，还要说服所有的中农。都要劳动生产。”二区小昌村军属申春莲：“我过去认为男人参了军，自己在家不劳动，等吃坐穿。今天听了毛主席共产党的政策，我回去要好好劳动，不但我要劳动，回去还要号召所有的军属都要参加劳动，不劳动生产打不垮蒋介石进攻。”（二）认识了劳动生产最光荣。六区对字沟傅喜土说：“过去我十三岁就给地主当了长工，犁地牵牲口，地主孩子十七岁还不叫他到牲口跟前，穷人命就不值钱。现在翻了身，娶上老婆，不想劳动，想过地主的生活，因过去一天不劳动一天就没有吃的。”二区，石相村长杨修义说：“过去我在山西赵城当小工，冬天穿不上棉衣，脚上都崩烈了，还给地主劳动；现在翻身连一担水也不愿意担了，以后坚决要劳动生产，坐好江山，不争馍馍要争口气。”三区五种村长尹六得说：“我过去给地主当了二十年长工，自己常想到什么时候自己能种几亩地，可要好好种，翻了身有了地，就不想劳动。”最后大家都弄清了，过去劳动为地主，现在劳动为自己，劳动是最光荣，不劳动是耻辱。（三）在发家致富的思想基础上，开展了算账运动，二区价字顿王景花，没有好好劳动，过去每年能打十八布袋粮食，去年只打七布袋粮食，一年就少得洋四十万元。一区晋祠村×××人说：“过去一天就编十领席，现在一天只编两个，三月一个月就少得洋四十万元。经过算账，大家都感到非好好劳动不行。（郭凤山、韩耀西、张聚珠）
