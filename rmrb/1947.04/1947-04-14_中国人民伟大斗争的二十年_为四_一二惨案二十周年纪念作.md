　　Twenty Years of the Chinese People's Great Struggle
    —In Commemoration of the Twentieth Anniversary of the April 12th Massacre

    The April 12th counter-revolutionary coup of 1927 marks its twentieth anniversary this year. This is the day when the head of the landlord and comprador bourgeoisie, the Chiang Kai-shek clique, attempted counter-revolution; it is a day the Chinese people cannot forget. Because this reactionary clique has been a scourge for twenty years since then, inflicting unprecedented suffering on the Chinese nation for nearly a century.

    If the great traitor Zeng Guofan was a counter-revolutionary from beginning to end, then Yuan Shikai was different; he had to pretend to support democratic republicanism at one point. The last representative of the landlord and comprador bourgeoisie, China's last great traitor and feudal lord, Chiang Kai-shek, is even more despicable in character than Zeng Guofan and Yuan Shikai! He "participated in the revolution in his early years," and he relies on "revolution" to climb up, relying on "revolution" to acquire political capital; otherwise, he couldn't climb up, and wouldn't have political capital. Overturning like clouds and raining like hands, betraying trust and righteousness, on one hand, there are countless beautiful words and promises, and on the other hand, there is the most brutal slaughter, oppression, and exploitation. The so-called "good words are spoken by the gentleman, and bad deeds are done by the gentleman," this is an accurate portrayal of the last rulers of the Chinese landlord and comprador bourgeoisie. The representatives of the landlord and comprador bourgeoisie are so shameless because this reactionary class is about to die, and it is a manifestation of the Chinese people's increased awareness and growing strength.

    The April 12th massacre was the most shameless slaughter. Without the cooperation between the Chinese Communist Party and the Kuomintang, without Dr. Sun Yat-sen's three major policies of alliance with Russia, alliance with the Communist Party, and assistance to peasants and workers, the Northern Expedition would have been unimaginable. Without the Chinese Communist Party members and many Kuomintang revolutionaries leading the people to rise up and respond in the army and in various places, the victory of the Northern Expedition would have been unimaginable. Without the Chinese Communist Party leading the general strike and uprising of 800,000 workers in Shanghai to welcome the Northern Expeditionary Army, it would have been unimaginable for the Northern Expeditionary Army to enter Shanghai. During the Northern Expedition, Chiang Kai-shek's route had no military achievements, and he even suffered a major defeat in Nanchang. All the credit belongs to others, and Chiang Kai-shek's desire to take credit is already the height of shamelessness! However, Chiang Kai-shek not only wanted to take credit, but also turned his gun back and attempted to wipe out the essence of the Chinese nation all at once. Chiang Kai-shek's ruthlessness was so extreme! What about the representative of this landlord and comprador bourgeoisie, who is extremely cruel to his own nation, towards the imperialists? At that time, British imperialist warships fired a few shells at Nanjing, and on the other hand, gave Chiang Kai-shek a small bribe, and Chiang Kai-shek obeyed the will of the imperialists and turned his guns against the people.

    The Chinese Communist Party first pointed out twenty years ago: the Chiang Kai-shek clique is reactionary, is white terror, is a traitor to Sun Yat-sen, and is a running dog of imperialism. If the rule of this reactionary clique is tolerated, the Chinese nation will suffer endless disasters. The national liberation and democratic liberation of the Chinese people can never be realized under this reactionary rule. At the same time, it also pointed out: this reactionary rule is fragile and will definitely collapse. The Chinese Communist Party pointed this out twenty years ago.

    The process of twenty years has step by step proven the correctness of the Chinese Communist Party's views, the reactionary nature of the Chiang Kai-shek ruling clique, and its fragility.

    The process of twenty years, on the one hand, is the process of the Chiang Kai-shek clique's extreme reaction increasingly exposed. There are three periods in twenty years: the Land Revolution period, the Anti-Japanese War period, and the current period of struggle for independence, peace, and democracy. During the Land Revolution period, the Chinese Communist Party held high the banner of land reform, the banner of land to the tiller; while the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique opposed land reform with constant "encirclement and suppression," and these "encirclement and suppression" operations were carried out with the help of imperialism. This led to the invasion of Japanese imperialism. When Japanese imperialism invaded our country and our Chinese nation was in a major crisis, the Chinese Communist Party and the broad masses of patriotic people demanded and carried out active warfare against Japan to defend the motherland. The Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique first pursued a policy of non-resistance, suppressing the patriotic movement; later, after a little resistance, it turned to passively watching the war. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, it colluded with enemy and puppet remnants to harm compatriots, plundering everywhere, acting like bandits. In the current period, now that the War of Resistance has been won, the people of the whole country are demanding independence, peace, and democracy, and the Chinese Communist Party is resolutely fighting for this, while the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique is resolutely implementing a policy of national betrayal, dictatorship, and civil war. Instead of easing the national crisis, it is deepening the national crisis. The lives of the broad masses of people in the Chiang-occupied areas are even far worse than during the rule of the Japanese and Wang Jingwei; the economic collapse has reached the point of near total national bankruptcy, and his dictatorial rule is even more barbaric than the foreign rule of Japan. In foreign relations, he openly serves as an appendage and servant of American imperialism, just like the traitor Wang Jingwei did to Japanese imperialism. In the past twenty years, the reactionary nature of the Chiang Kai-shek clique has never been as nakedly exposed as it is today. Now no one doubts that the Chiang Kai-shek clique is the biggest traitor in history, the most reactionary reactionary.

    The process of twenty years, on the other hand, is also the process of the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique's fragility being increasingly exposed. During the Land Revolution period, the contrast between the people's strength and the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique's strength was very disparate. But even with such a disparity, the people's army and revolutionary base areas still existed and developed. The Chinese people have cultivated a great figure like Comrade Mao Zedong. Under his leadership, the Chinese people can use their own strength to defeat the joint offensive of the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique and imperialism. During the Anti-Japanese War, the People's Liberation Army organized by Comrades Mao Zedong, Zhu De, and others became the Great Wall of the Chinese nation. Without him, it would be impossible to imagine the launch of the Anti-Japanese War, let alone the perseverance of the eight-year Anti-Japanese War, and the final victory. During the Anti-Japanese War, the People's Liberation Army and many liberated areas became models for the whole country. These liberated areas have also become models for the whole country in terms of economic construction and economic recovery. For the first time in thousands of years, cities and villages without beggars, prostitutes, or hunger have appeared on Chinese territory. This stands in stark contrast to the Chiang-controlled areas ruled by imperialism, bureaucrat capital, and fascist bandits. The Chinese people are entering a new period of struggle for independence, peace, and democracy with such a strong posture. The process of twenty years undoubtedly shows that the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique can be defeated, and the people are invincible!

    If the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique used to "do all the bad things and say all the good things," then now this reactionary clique has reached such a dead end that it can't even say anything good anymore. Reactionaries must make some promises to the people, but these promises are only to paralyze the people. After this purpose is achieved, the reactionaries will definitely go back on their promises and carry out bloody massacres against those who demand the fulfillment of these promises. This is a truth that has remained unchanged both in China and abroad to this day. For twenty years, the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique has constantly used promises, plans, and programs to paralyze the people, and it is still doing so now. However, their reversals come so quickly, and their exploitation, oppression, and slaughter of the people are so cruel that it is already difficult to even arouse people's illusions about him. Therefore, his final solution is to openly reveal his ferocious appearance and simply use his ferocity to intimidate the people. However, the fragility, powerlessness, and unpopularity of this reactionary clique have already been seen through, and no one is afraid of it anymore. The Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique has now reached its end. The high tide of the Chinese people's and the national democratic movement is bound to come. The blood debts of the revolutionary martyrs who were slaughtered by the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique will be repaid, and their legacy—a new, independent, peaceful, and democratic China—will definitely be realized.

    The past twenty years have been twenty years of the Chinese people's great struggle. This struggle is coming to an end, and that is the demise of Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary rule. Because Chiang Kai-shek wants to destroy the Chinese people, the Chinese people must unite to destroy Chiang Kai-shek!

　　中国人民伟大斗争的二十年
    ——为四·一二惨案二十周年纪念作
    一九二七年的四·一二反革命政变，到今年是二十周年了。这是大地主大资产阶级的头子蒋介石集团企图反革命的日子；是中国人民不能忘记的日子。因为这个反动集团从那时起，已经为害二十年之久，使中华民族受到近百年来空前未有的痛苦。
    如果大汉奸曾国藩从头至尾做反革命，那么袁世凯已经不同，他不能不一度假装赞成民主共和。大地主大资产阶级的最后一个代表，中国最后的一个大汉奸、大封建主蒋介石，则在人格上比曾国藩、袁世凯还要卑鄙！他是“早年参加革命”的，他要靠“革命”来爬上去，靠“革命”来取得政治资本；否则就爬不上去，就没有政治资本。翻云覆雨，背信弃义，一方面是无数的漂亮字句和诺言，另一方面是最残暴的屠杀、压迫与剥削。所谓“好话为先生说尽，坏事为先生做完”，这就是中国大地主大资产阶级末代统治者的确切不移的写照。大地主大资产阶级的代表，所以如此无耻，乃是这个反动阶层将要死亡的表现，乃是中国人民觉悟提高与力量壮大的表现。
    四·一二惨案是最无耻的屠杀。没有中国共产党与国民党合作，没有孙中山先生的联俄、联共、扶助工农三大政策，北伐是不可想像的。没有中国共产党党员与许多国民党革命分子在军队中和在各地领导人民起来响应，北伐的胜利是不可想像的。没有中国共产党领导上海八十万工人的总罢工与起义欢迎北伐军，北伐军进入上海也是不可想像的。在北伐过程中，蒋介石的一路是毫无战功的，而且在南昌还打了一个很大的败仗。一切功劳都是别人的，蒋介石要冒得功劳，已经是无耻之尤！然而蒋介石不但要冒功，还要回过枪来企图一下子把中华民族的精华扫除干净。蒋介石的狠毒竟到如此程度！这个对于自己的民族极端残忍的大地主大资产阶级的代表，对于帝国主义者又是怎样呢？当时英国帝国主义的军舰对南京轰了几炮，另一方面又给了蒋介石不大的贿赂，蒋介石就服从帝国主义的意志，向人民倒转枪头了。
    中国共产党在二十年前首先指出：蒋介石集团就是反动，就是白色恐怖，就是孙中山的叛徒，就是帝国主义的走狗。如果容忍这一反动集团的统治，则中华民族将受到无穷的灾难。中国人民的民族解放与民主解放，决不能在这种反动统治之下实现。同时又指出：这个反动统治是脆弱的，是一定要崩溃的。中国共产党在二十年前，已经这样指出过。
    二十年的过程，一步一步证明中国共产党见解的正确，证明蒋介石统治集团的反动性，又证明其脆弱性。
    廿年的过程，一方面是蒋介石集团的极端反动性日益暴露的过程。二十年里三个时期：一是土地革命时期，二是抗日战争时期，三是现在为独立、和平、民主而奋斗的时期。在土地革命时期中，中国共产党高举起土地改革的旗帜，耕者有其田的旗帜；而蒋介石反动集团，则以不断的“围剿”来反对土地改革，并且这些“围剿”都是在帝国主义帮助之下进行的。这就引起了日本帝国主义的侵略。在日本帝国主义侵略我国，我中华民族处于重大危机中的时候，中国共产党与广大的爱国人民，要求而且进行了积极对日作战，保卫祖国。蒋介石反动集团，先则奉行不抵抗主义，压迫爱国运动；其后在稍稍抵抗之后，变为消极观战。在抗战胜利之后，则勾结敌伪残害同胞，到处劫收，行同盗匪。在当前时期中，抗战既经胜利，全国人民都要求独立、和平与民主，中国共产党坚决为此奋斗，而蒋介石反动集团，则坚决实行卖国独裁内战的政策。不是使民族危机和缓下去，而是使民族危机更加加深。蒋占区广大人民的生活，甚至远不及日汪统治的时候；经济崩溃到了接近全国总破产的程度，他的独裁统治比日本的异族统治还要野蛮。对外关系则公然做美国帝国主义的附庸与臣仆，与汉奸汪精卫对日本帝国主义一模一样。廿年以来，蒋介石集团的反动性，从来没有像今天那样赤裸裸的暴露出来。现在已经再没有人怀疑蒋介石集团是历史上最大的汉奸卖国贼，最反动的反动派。
    廿年的过程，一方面又是蒋介石反动集团的脆弱性日益暴露的过程。在土地革命的时期中，人民的力量与蒋介石反动集团的力量，其对比是非常悬殊的。但就算那样悬殊，人民的军队和革命的根据地，还是存在和发展了。中国人民之中锻炼出像毛泽东同志这样的伟大人物。在他的领导之下，中国人民就能以自己的力量，战胜蒋介石反动集团与帝国主义的联合进攻。在抗日战争中，由毛泽东、朱德等同志组织起来的人民解放军，成了中华民族的长城。没有他，就不能想像抗日战争的发动，更不能想像八年抗日战争的坚持，与最后取得胜利。抗日战争中，人民解放军与许多解放区做了全国的模范。这些解放区在经济建设与经济恢复的工作方面，又成为全国的模范。在几千年的长时期中，中国领土上第一次出现了没有乞丐、没有娼妓、没有饥饿的城市和乡村。与帝国主义、官僚资本、法西斯匪徒所统治的蒋管区，成了最鲜明的对照。中国人民以这样雄健的姿态，踏入为独立、和平、民主而奋斗的新时期。二十年的过程，确切无疑的说明：蒋介石反动集团是可以战胜的，而人民是不可战胜的！
    如果蒋介石反动集团，以往是“坏事做完，好话说尽”；那末到了现在，这个反动集团是走到这样穷途末路：以致连好话也说不出什么了。反动派对于人民一定要做一些诺言，但这些诺言，仅仅是为了麻痹人民。在这个目的达到之后，反动派又一定反悔自己的诺言，并对于要求实践这些诺言的人们，进行血腥的屠杀。这是至今中外不变的真理。蒋介石这一反动集团，二十年来不断以诺言、计划、方案来麻痹人民，现在仍然如此。但是，他们的反悔是来的那么快，对于人民的剥削、压迫与残杀是那么残酷，已经连要想引起人们对他的幻想都很困难。于是他的最后办法，就只有公开露出自己的凶相，干脆以自己的凶恶来恐吓人民。但是，这个反动集团的脆弱无力、众叛亲离，又已被人看穿，已经没有什么人再怕它了。蒋介石反动集团，现在已经走到他们的末路。中国人民的、全国的民主运动的高潮，是一定要到来了。被蒋介石反动集团所屠杀的人民先烈们，他们的血债将被偿还，他们的遗志——一个新的独立、和平、民主的中国，是一定要实现了。
    过去的二十年，是中国人民伟大斗争的二十年。这个斗争快要结束了，这就是蒋介石反动统治的灭亡。因为蒋介石要灭亡中国人民，因此中国人民必然团结起来灭亡蒋介石！
