Li Village Ditch Untangles Mutual Aid Team Conflicts
	Whole Village United Begins Spring Plowing
	[Report from Lucheng by Our Newspaper] Li Village Ditch is an advanced village in the new Lucheng area. Last year, during the Great Production Movement, it was selected as the "Organized Model Village" in the fifth district. This year, it has progressed from resolving conflicts between cadres and the masses to resolving conflicts within mutual aid teams. It has rectified the mutual aid teams, summarized the experiences of getting organized last year, and mobilized for this spring's organization movement. Liang Madou's team is a model team in Li Village Ditch. Yuan Ze raised an opinion to Hao Facheng, the chairman of the farmers' association, saying that last year, when preparing for war, he was sending public grain to ×× village and asked Facheng to take it along, but Facheng secretly sold a dou of his rice. Geng Ren testified to this, and Facheng admitted his mistake and took out a dou of rice to resolve the conflict. Facheng, Jin Qiu, and Xiao Tianfu raised opinions: they have livestock and plowed wheat fields for families without livestock but didn't receive wages. During the autumn harvest, they used Yuan Ze's and Huai Xi's labor and paid wages. Therefore, some families who raised livestock were unwilling to continue raising livestock, and some wanted to disband the team. They calculated the wages on the spot, resolving the wage conflict by proposing "pay wages first, then conduct self-criticism." Xiao Tianfu raised an opinion to Huai Xi, saying, "You slack off on heavy work but show up for light work. You earn three sheng every day, and I'm not satisfied." Pang Rou, from a well-off family, said, "I do all the heavy work, but Huai De is afraid to move. He earns three sheng every day, which is clearly unreasonable." They resolved this conflict by stipulating wages and work conversion methods based on the seasonal busyness, skill level, and the heaviness of the work. Last year, on June 6th, everyone summarized the mutual aid and cleared the accounts. After calculating, they saved a lot of labor and did a lot more work. Everyone was very happy and had a meal together. Xiao Tianfu took out three dou of wheat to grind into flour, and Madou contributed one thousand yuan to buy vegetables. The accounts haven't been cleared until now, and Tianfu and Madou have opinions. They proposed that everyone share the cost equally, resolving this conflict. Everyone found the root of the problem: they didn't properly implement work point calculation and conversion, and diligent accounting. They said, "Last year was like tying a camel with a long hemp rope, dragging along. This year should be like tofu with green onions, clear and distinct."
	Suo Ze's team is also a model team. Village Chief Kui Ze raised an opinion to team leader Suo Ze, saying, "When it's your land, you start early and work until late; when it's my land, you only eat." Others raised an opinion to Kui Ze: "Kui Ze's livestock aren't pulling their weight. When hauling manure, other people's livestock are harnessed to the yoke, but his livestock are pulling on the side." Everyone had a democratic discussion. Although they ate at Kui Ze's house, he hoed his land three times, while other people's land was hoed only twice. Kui Ze also accepted the mistake that his livestock weren't pulling their weight and were contributing less. Everyone stipulated that from now on, work would be done "one day at a time." The large group would be divided into small groups. They would see how many people could finish the work in one day and assign that many people. Whoever's land they were working on, they would eat at that person's house, which would be fair and in rotation, and the land wouldn't be left uncultivated. Before resolving the conflicts, there were thirteen teams in Li Village Ditch. Before the conflicts were resolved, everyone was clamoring to reorganize, and eleven teams disbanded. Two teams remained intact, and a total of twenty-five teams were formed. After the conflicts were resolved, the disbanded teams merged again, leaving only one team disbanded, and one new team was created, still totaling thirteen teams. The two teams that never disbanded were Guo Ji team and Fa Wang team. Last year, they argued every day. Every time they argued, they resolved a problem. They became more and more consolidated, and by autumn, Guo Ji team established a tofu workshop, and Fa Wang team bought a cotton gin and combined it with sideline production, which continues to this day. Last year, Madou's team and Suo Ze's team were model teams. Everyone emphasized "tolerance," accepting losses and saying it didn't matter. On the surface, there were no problems, but as a result, more and more problems accumulated. This year, there were the most conflicts. At the worst, people with conflicts wouldn't talk to each other until the conflicts were resolved, and then everyone became united. Everyone accepted this experience and proposed "Visit your own thoughts, don't wait for others to feel them" and "Frequently express thoughts, frequently resolve conflicts" to promote democracy and collective leadership. Now, the thirteen teams have begun spring plowing, land reclamation, and manure spreading. (Liu Cun)

　　李村沟解开互助组疙瘩
    全村团结开始春耕
    【本报潞城讯】李村沟是潞城新区的先进村，去年大生产运动中，被选为五区的“组织起来模范村”，今年又从解干群疙瘩，发展到解互助疙瘩，整顿了互助组，总结了去年组织起来的经验，动员了今春的组织起来运动。梁马豆组是李村沟的模范组，元则向农会主席郝发成提出意见，说去年备战时往××村送公粮，叫发成捎带送，发成偷粜了他一斗米，庚仁为证，发成承认了错误，拿出了一斗米，解开了疙瘩。发成、金秋、小天福提出意见：他们有牲口，给没牲口的家犁了麦地没有给工资。秋收时，他们用了元则、怀喜的人工出了工资。因此喂牲口家有的不愿再喂牲口，有的要散组。他们把工资当下就算清，提出“先给工资后检讨”，工资疙瘩才算解开。小天福给怀喜提意见说：“重生活你歪了，轻生活你出来了，一天都是赚三升，我就不满意。”胖肉是好受家，他说：“重生活都是我干，怀德怕动弹，一天都是赚三升，显着不合理。”他们按季节闲忙，把式好坏，轻重生活，规定了工资和折工办法来解开这个疙瘩。去年六月六，大家总结互助，清理账目，一算省下许多工，多做许多生活，大家非常高兴，就打伙吃了一顿饭，小天福拿出三斗麦子磨面，马豆垫出一千元买菜，直到现在没清账，天福、马豆有意见。他们提出来，大家均摊，就解开了这个疙瘩。大家找到疙瘩根子，是没有很好实行计工折工、勤算账，说：“去年是长麻绳拴骆驼，拖拖拉拉，今年应该是小葱拌豆腐，一清二白。”
    锁则组也是模范组，村长魁则对小组长锁则提出意见说：“到你地，起早迈晌；到我地，光吃饭”。别人又给魁则提出意见“魁则牲口不优抗，载粪时人家牲口驾辕，他的牲口拉稍。大家民主讨论一回，虽说在魁则家吃饭，他地锄了三遍，别人地只锄了两遍，魁则也接受了牲口不优抗出力小的错误。大家规定以后做生活是“一递一天”，大组划小组，看几个人一天能干完就分派几个人去，给谁家干在谁家吃，就公平了、轮公了，生活按排好就荒不了地。在解疙瘩以前，李村沟有十三个组，未解开时大家闹着重新结合，散了十一个组，有两个组未散，共结合成二十五个组。疙瘩解开后，散了的组又合并起来，只散了一个组，又新产生一个组，还是十三组。始终没有散的两个组，一个是过季组，一个是发旺组，去年天天吵架，吵一回，解决一个问题，以后越来越巩固，发展到秋天，过季组成立一豆腐坊，发旺组买了弹花车结合起副业，一直干到现在。马豆组锁则组去年是模范组，大家都讲“涵厚”，吃了亏，还说不要紧，表面没有问题，结果越积垒问题越多，今年疙瘩最多，最严重时有疙瘩的人谁见谁也不多说话，直到解开疙瘩，大家才团结了。大家接受了这经验，提出“心思自己访，不等别人摸”“勤表心思，勤解疙瘩”。来发扬民主，集体领导，现在十三个组，已开始春耕、薰荒，送粪。（柳村）
