　　The Land Reform Movement in Li Machang, Jize
    Tang Ximin
        I. Class Relations Before the Land Reform Movement
    Li Machang is located in the Fourth District of Jize, twenty-five li southeast of the county town, a medium-sized village. Before the Anti-Japanese War, the village had a total of 140 households with 624 people, cultivating nearly 32 hectares of land. At that time, 20 large households took turns managing the village affairs, four families each year. These 20 large households had only 153 people, less than a quarter of the village's total population, but they occupied 1,731 mu of land, accounting for more than 54 percent of the village's total land. Among them, the Chang Zonghan and other three households alone occupied 537 mu of land, almost 17 percent of the village's total land.
    During the Anti-Japanese War, through the anti-corruption and anti-enemy investment struggle in 1941, the return of village houses and land redemption movement in 1944, the exposing of hidden land struggle in the spring of 1945, and the tenant movement featuring rent reduction, interest refunds, and capital increase after liberation, the village's feudal forces had been initially defeated. In previous movements, peasants had successively recovered about five hectares of land from the landlords. In addition, in these years, landlords had successively sold or pawned some poor land to the masses at low prices in order to avoid paying more reasonable burdens. Therefore, the landlords' land changes were very large, with a total reduction of more than six hectares.
    However, because the fruits were distributed according to the specific issue in the past, as a result of the movement, all hired laborers who had worked as laborers, rented land, and used interest money, each recovered a lot of land from the landlords, and from then on turned over. Not only were all six extremely poor households in the village eliminated, but among the past six extremely poor households and forty-one poor households, thirty-three households rose to become new middle peasants. Even the old middle peasants obtained eighty or ninety mu of land, and even the rich peasants increased their land by more than twenty mu. However, some poor peasants, because they had no direct exploitative relationship with the landlords, such as renting land or borrowing money, had no way to obtain land or obtained very little land, and therefore did not turn over.
    Before the land reform movement, the land ownership situation of each class in Li Machang was as follows: 12 landlord households, with 51 people, owned a total of 281.81 mu of land, averaging 5.42 mu per person; 21 rich peasant households, with 98 people, owned a total of 607.75 mu of land, averaging 6.2 mu per person; 69 old middle peasant households, with 258 people, owned a total of 1,454.48 mu of land, averaging 5.64 mu per person; 33 new middle peasant households, with 96 people, owned a total of 491.27 mu of land, averaging 5.11 mu per person; 14 poor peasant households, with 35 people, owned a total of 84.4 mu of land, averaging 2.42 mu per person. In addition: 3 households from other villages owned 19 mu of land in this village; 4 households that fled famine owned 41.9 mu of land; 1 household with no one to inherit it owned 18.5 mu of land; and 1 fleeing despotic landlord household owned 183 mu of land. In total, the village had 155 households, 539 people, and 3,179.5 mu of land. (Note: The landlords and rich peasants listed here are all statistically classified according to their original components.)
            II. Ideological Education and Organizational Work of the Land Reform Movement
    When land reform was implemented last September, the village cadres, in conjunction with the district cadres, first conducted a detailed study of the land distribution situation in the village. Everyone unanimously believed that the previous movement in the village was relatively thorough, and the landlords' land had been almost eliminated, leaving only some feudal remnants. Therefore, the specific policy for land reform in the village was determined to be "thoroughly eliminate the feudal remnants of the landlords and weaken the feudal parts of the rich peasants," and according to the method of filling in and making up, the land and houses seized in the struggle were fairly and reasonably distributed to the masses who lacked housing and land, eliminating all the poor peasants in the village and truly achieving a situation where everyone had land to cultivate.
    After the policy was determined, the members of various mass organizations were mobilized to discuss it. Before the discussion, many members felt that it was almost enough and did not want to fight anymore. However, after guiding them in the group meetings to compare their lives with the landlords, they were asked to carefully compare their current lives with the landlords to see if the landlords had been thoroughly overthrown? Whether everyone had truly turned over? After careful comparison, everyone realized that although the landlords had been weakened a lot, they still had good land, good houses, and a lot of floating wealth, and were still much stronger than the newly turned-over middle peasants. Although a part of the poor peasants had obtained land and risen to become middle peasants, they still lacked houses, furniture, etc., and had not really turned over. In particular, there were still fourteen poor peasant households in the village, with an average of less than three mu of land per person, and they had not turned over at all. As a result, everyone's fighting spirit was greatly enhanced, and they all actively demanded continued movement.
    Because there were very few members of various mass organizations in the village at that time, the Farmers' Association had only more than fifty people, the Women's Association had only forty-four members, and the militia was less than twenty people. Not only were the vast majority of middle peasants not organized, but even an honest poor peasant had not joined the Farmers' Association. Therefore, before the movement, the various mass organizations were reorganized and expanded. For the honest poor peasants who had not joined the organization, the members who were close to them were asked to talk to them and guide them to complain about their hardships. Their class consciousness was enlightened, their thinking was opened up, and then they were introduced to the Farmers' Association. As for the middle peasants and well-to-do middle peasants, they saw that the hired poor peasants had risen up, and the Farmers' Association had a position in the village, so they all took the initiative to find the Farmers' Association members and asked to be introduced to the association. The Farmers' Association members said to them: "Our middle and poor peasants are one family, and we have all been exploited and oppressed by the landlords in the past. Now that you are willing to join the Farmers' Association and fight and turn over with us, we welcome you to come in." Therefore, new members developed very quickly. In five or six days, the Farmers' Association and the Women's Association doubled in size. The Farmers' Association developed to ninety-seven people, the Women's Association also increased to one hundred and seven people, and the male militia expanded to thirty people, and a sixteen-member female militia team was newly established. In this way, except for the landlords and rich peasants, all the poor, hired, and middle peasants in the village were organized. However, the ideological understanding of these newly joined masses was very poor. Therefore, another ideological education was carried out in the whole village, and the members were divided into groups to conduct in-depth complaints, dig out the roots of poverty, settle accounts with the landlords for exploitation, and compare their lives with the landlords. At the same time, everyone was asked to democratically discuss class division. After the group discussion was completed, a general assembly was held. On the one hand, everyone was asked to democratically evaluate the class composition of each household in the village. On the other hand, everyone was asked to determine the extent to which the landlords should be overthrown. Regarding the former, five colored paper balls of red, yellow, blue, white, and black were made according to the five classes of extremely poor, poor peasants, middle peasants, rich peasants, and landlords, and everyone was allowed to vote freely. After voting, if a household received the most black paper balls, it was determined to be a landlord. Conversely, if it received the most red paper balls, it was an extremely poor person. Regarding the latter, the principle set at that time was: the landlords should exchange good houses and good land for poor peasants, and they should also take out floating wealth.
            III. The Course of the Struggle
    After the ideological education and rectification of the organization were done well, each group was allowed to brew, find targets for struggle, and widely collect everyone's opinions on the landlords. After the brewing matured, a general assembly was held to decide, also adopting the method of voting. When everyone voted, they had to write down not only who they wanted to fight, but also the facts of the suffering they had endured. After the voting was completed, according to the number of votes and the size of the crimes mentioned by everyone, the households to be fought were determined, and according to the facts of the suffering written on the votes, the victims were specifically organized to prepare for the general assembly to complain about their hardships.
    This time, the masses found four targets for struggle: despotic landlords Chang Zonghan, Chang Hongru, Chang Dianhua, and feudal rich peasant Chang Delin. Because the masses were busy planting wheat at that time and had no time during the day, everyone worked in the fields during the day and held meetings to fight at night, fighting one person a night. All four were fought in four days, and a total of 59.4 mu of land was seized. At the same time, almost all the landlords and rich peasants in the village took the initiative to find the Farmers' Association to request "automatic surrender" as soon as the struggle began in the village. However, after everyone's discussion, they did not accept all of them, but selectively accepted the things of thirteen households according to the size of their crimes and their current living conditions. Among them, a total of nine households voluntarily surrendered land, including one landlord household and eight rich peasant households, totaling 74.3 mu of land.
    In total, in this movement, including the 222.9 mu of land confiscated from the fleeing large despotic landlord Chang Pilun and the fleeing traitor household in Quzhou County, the masses recovered 377.6 mu of land; and 21 tile-roofed houses, totaling 218 rooms, 6 carts, 32 shi of grain, and other furniture, clothing, etc., worth 515,000 yuan.
            IV. Situation of Fruit Distribution
    Li Machang has two methods of distributing the fruits: one is that the land and houses are distributed to the masses who lack land and housing according to the principle of filling in and making up; the other is that furniture and clothing, etc., are fairly and reasonably distributed to everyone who participates in the struggle according to six grades. Before the evaluation and distribution, eight appraisers were elected by the masses through universal voting to work with the village cadres to jointly evaluate.
    The distribution of land is to first fill the poor pits and then make up the difference. The standard for filling in: the general masses are five mu, the military dependents are six mu, the honored dependents are seven mu, and the martyrs' dependents are the most, and they are made up to eight mu per person. In order to take care of the living difficulties of the elderly, weak, widowed, and households with few people, the land of one or two people is converted into standard mu according to the yield, and they are filled in according to the standard mu. Households with more than three people are calculated according to the existing land (because there is no very bad land in the village, and the difference between good and bad land is not very large), so they are no longer converted into standard mu. As a result of this distribution, all fifteen poor peasant households in the village were allocated land, with an average of more than three mu of land per person; twenty-nine old middle peasant households and nineteen new middle peasant households also averaged one to two mu of land per person; a total of sixty-four households in the village were allocated land, and the population receiving land reached 225 people, with a total of 342 mu of land.
    The distribution of houses is based on who lacks houses. The martyrs' dependents and military dependents are given priority, and the general masses, those without labor are given better houses, and those with labor are given worse houses.
    The distribution of furniture and clothing, etc., is divided into six grades. Before the distribution, six standard households were selected from the fruit distribution households, and then each household was compared with this standard. After the evaluation was completed, the list of grades of the fruit distribution households in the village was posted for everyone to make comments. If everyone had no comments, it was passed according to this list. At the same time, the furniture and other items were also evaluated and priced, and the amount that each person in each grade should receive was obtained based on the total value of all the fruits. When distributing, everyone was allowed to freely select items according to the amount they should receive, and the martyrs', honored, military, and cadre dependents were allowed to select first, followed by the general masses, who were selected one grade at a time according to the order of extremely poor, poor peasants, and middle peasants.
    Because the evaluated grades and prices were very fair, the method of distributing the fruits was very reasonable, and the cadres and the masses were all distributed the same, without getting any extra or mentioning any bonuses, the masses were very satisfied after the distribution was completed.
    After this movement, the land ownership situation of each class in Li Machang was: (1) 12 middle peasant households descended from landlords, with an average of 4.55 mu of land per person; (2) 21 middle peasant households descended from rich peasants or changed their mode of production, with an average of 5.3 mu of land per person; (3) 69 old middle peasant households, with an average of 6.12 mu of land per person; (4) 33 new middle peasant households (who had turned over last spring), with an average of 6.25 mu of land per person; (5) 15 emerging middle peasant households (i.e., poor peasants who have risen in this movement), with an average of 5.6 mu of land per person. The whole village realized that tillers own their land.

　　鸡泽李马昌的土地改革运动
    唐西民
        一、土地改革运动前的阶级关系
    李马昌是鸡泽四区，在县城东南二十五里以外，一个中等村子。抗战以前，全村共有居民一百四十户，六百二十四口人，耕种着将近三十二顷的土地。当时，由二十大户，四家一年轮流着办理村里的公事。这二十家大户，只有一百五十三口人，还不到全村人口总数四分之一，可是，他们却占有了一七三一亩土地，占全村土地总数的百分之五十四还多。其中仅常宗汉等三户，就占去了土地五百三十七亩，差不多为全村土地总数的百分之十七。
    经过了抗战期间，一九四一年的反贪污反资敌斗争，一九四四年的回庄宅赎地运动，一九四五年春天的揭黑瞒地斗争，以及解放以后的以减租、退息和增资为内容的雇佃运动，村里的封建势力已初步打垮了。在历次的运动中，农民陆续从地主手里清算回来五顷左右的土地；再加上在这几年里，地主为了逃避多出合理负担，也曾先后将一些坏地低价出卖或典当给群众，因此，地主的土地变动是很大的，总计共减少土地在六顷以上。
    可是，因为过去都是按问题分果实，所以运动的结果，凡是当过雇工、租过地和使过利钱的雇贫农，每人都从地主手里拿回不少土地，从此翻转了身。不仅全村的六户赤贫完全消灭了，在过去的六户赤贫及四十一户贫农中，有三十三户上升为新中农，就是老中农也得到了八、九十亩土地，甚至连富农都增加了土地二十多亩。然而，还有一些贫农，由于和地主没有租佃及借贷等直接剥削关系，也就无从获得土地或得地很少，因而没有翻了身。
    在土地改革运动前，李马昌各阶层占有土地的情形是这样的：地主十二户，五十一口人，共有土地二八一·八一亩，每人平均五·四二亩；富农二十一户，九十八口人，共有土地六○七·七五亩，每人平均六·二亩；老中农六九户，二五八口人，共有土地一四五四·四八亩，每人平均五·六四亩；新中农三十三户，九十六口人，共有地四九一·二七亩，每人平均五·一一亩；贫农十四户，三十五口人，共有土地八四·四亩，每人平均二·四二亩。另有：外村三户，在本村共有地十九亩；全家逃荒外出四户，共有地四一·九亩；绝尸一户，地十八亩半；以及逃亡恶霸大地主一户，土地一八三亩。合计全村共一五五户，五三九口人，共有土地三一七九·五亩。（注：这里所列的地主和富农，都是按他们原来的成份统计的）
            二、土地改革运动的思想教育与组织工作
    去年九月实行土地改革，开始村干部结合区干部先把本村的土地分配情形作了一番详细的研究，大家一致认为：本村过去运动比较彻底，地主的土地消灭的已经差不多了，剩下的只是一些封建尾巴；所以，就决定了本村进行土地政革的具体方针，是“彻底消灭地主的封建尾巴与削弱富农的封建部分”，并按照填平补齐的办法，把斗出土地和房屋公平合理的分给缺房少地的群众，把村里的贫农全部消灭，真正做到人人有地种。
    方针确定以后，就发动各群众团体的会员进行讨论。在未讨论前，好多会员觉得已经差不多了，都不愿意再斗了；可是，经过小组会上引导他们跟地主比生活，叫他他们拿自己现在的生活来和地主仔细比一比，看看地主到底斗的彻底不彻底？大家翻身翻的究竟是否真正翻透了？大家仔细一比较，这才认识到地主虽然已经削弱不少了，但仍是地好房好浮财众多，比起新翻身的中农来，依然强得很多；而一部分贫农虽已得到土地上升为中农了，房屋、家具等还是异常缺乏，实际上并没有翻透身；特别是本村尚有十四户贫农，每人平均土地都在三亩以下，根本就没有翻了身。于是大家的斗争情绪就大大的提高起来了，都积极的要求继续运动。
    因为当时村里各群众团体的会员很少，农会只有五十多个人，妇会亦只有四十四个会员，民兵则尚不足廿名，不仅绝大部分中农没有组织起来，还有一老实的贫农也没有参加农会。因此在未运动以前，又把各群众组织整理扩大了一下。对于没有参加组织的老实贫农，就叫跟他接近的会员去同他谈话，好好的引导他诉苦。启发他的阶级觉悟，打通他的思想，然后，把他们介绍到农会里来。至于中农和富裕中农，他们看到雇贫农起来了，农会在村里有了地位，就都主动的来找农会员，要求介绍他们入会，农会员对他们说：“咱们中贫农是一家人，过去都受过地主的剥削和压迫，你们现在愿意参加农会，来和我们一起斗争、翻身，我们是欢迎你们进来的。”因此，新会员发展的很快，五、六天工夫农会和妇会都扩大了一倍，农会发展到九十七个人，妇会也增加到一百零七名，男民兵则扩大到三十名，并新成立了十六个人的女民兵队。这样一来，除了地主、富农以外，全村所有的贫雇中农都组织起来了。不过这些新入会的群众思想认识都是很差的，所以，接着又在全村进行了一次思想教育，把会员分组进行深入的诉苦、挖穷根、跟地主算剥削账、和地主比生活；同时，叫大家来民主讨论划阶级。小组讨论好了，再召开全体大会，一方面是叫大家来民主评定全村每户人家的阶级成份，另一方面是让大家来确定对地主打到如何程度。关于前者，是按照极贫、贫农、中农、富农、地主等五个阶层，做了一些红黄蓝白黑五色纸团，让大家来自由的投票；投票以后，如某一户得的黑色纸团最多，就决定他是个地主，反之，如得红色纸团最多，那他就是个极贫。关于后者，当时定的原则是：要地主把好房好地换给贫农，并且还要拿出浮财来。
            三、斗争经过
    在思想教育和整顿组织搞好以后，就让各小组一齐来酝酿，找斗争对象，并广泛收集大家对地主的意见。酝酿成熟了，然后开全体大会来决定，也是采取投票表决的办法，每个人投票时，不仅要写上要斗谁，并且还要写上自己所受的痛苦事实。投完了票，就根据票数的多少及大家所提罪恶行为的大小，决定了该斗的户，并按照票上所写的痛苦事实，具体去组织这些苦主，准备大会诉苦。
    这一次，群众共找到了恶霸地主常宗汉、常鸿如、常殿华及封建富农常德林等四个斗争对象。因为当时群众正在忙着种麦，白天都没有工夫，于是，大家白天下地做活，晚上开会斗争，一晚上斗一个，四天工夫都斗完了，共斗出土地五九·四亩。与此同时，村里刚一开始斗争，差不多所有的地主和富农就都主动的来找农会要求“自动”，可是，经过大家的讨论，并没有都收他们的，只按其罪恶的大小及现在的生活情形，酌量着收留了十三户自动的东西。其中自动土地的共有九户，计：地主一户，富农八户，共自动地七四·三亩。
    总计在这次运动中，连没收本村逃亡大恶霸大地主常丕纶和曲周汉奸逃亡户的土地二二二·九亩在内，群众收回土地三七七·六亩；并有瓦屋二十一院，共二百一十八间，大车六辆，粮食三十二石，以及其他家具、衣裳等折款五十一万五千元。
            四、分果实情形
    李马昌分果实的办法，一共有两种：一种是土地和房屋，都按照填平补齐的原则，分给缺地少房的群众；另一种是家具和衣裳等，则按照六等，公平合理的分给每一个参加斗争的人。在进行评议和分配前，先由群众普遍投票选举了八个评议员，让他们和村干部在一起，来共同评议。
    分土地，是先填穷坑然后补平。填平的标准：一般群众是五亩，军属是六亩，荣属是七亩，烈属最多，每人按八亩补足。为了照顾老弱孤寡和人口少的户的生活困难，一两口人的都把地按产量折合成标准亩，按标准亩来给他们填平；三口人以上的则按现有地计算（因本村没有很坏的地，好坏地相差并不太远）就不再折标准亩了。这样分配的结果：全村十五户贫农全部分到了土地，每人平均分地三亩以上；还有二十九户老中农和十九户新中农，每人也都平均分到一亩至二亩的土地；合计全村共有六十四户分到土地，分地的人口共达二二五人，共分地三四二亩。
    分房子是谁缺房叫谁住。先尽烈属和军属分，一般的群众，无劳力的分较好的房子，有劳力的分比较坏点的房子。
    分家具和衣裳等，是按六等来分的。未分以前，先从分果实户里挑出来六个标准户，然后就一户一户的按照这个标准来互相比较。评议好了，就将全村分果实户的等级清单贴出来，让大家提意见，大家都没有意见，就照这个清单通过了。同时，把家具等东西也评好了价，并根据全部果实的总值，求得每一等户每个人应分的数目。分的时候，是让大家按照自己应分的数目去自由检东西，让烈、荣、军、干属依此先检，一般的群众，则按照极贫、贫农、中农的顺序，一级一级的挑下去。
    因为，评议的等级和物价都很公平，分果实的办法又极合理，而干部和群众又都是一样的分，一点儿也没有多得，也没有提什么奖励金；因此分完以后，群众很满意。
    经过这次运动以后，李马昌各阶层占有土地的情形是：（一）由地主下降的中农十二户，每人平均土地四·五五亩；（二）由富农下降或改变生产方式的中农二十一户，每人平均土地五·三亩；（三）老中农六十九户，每人平均土地六·一二亩；（四）新中农有三十三户（去年春天已经翻了身的），每人平均土地六·二五亩；（五）新兴中农（即此次运动中才上升的贫农）十五户，每人平均土地五·六亩。全村实现了耕者有其田。
