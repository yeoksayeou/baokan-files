Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 21st. A comprehensive report: Recently, the US government unilaterally decided on the issue of Japanese reparations, ordering MacArthur to allocate 30% of Japan's industrial equipment used for reparations to countries claiming reparations as an initial payment. The distribution ratio is as follows: China receives 15%, the Philippines 5%, the Netherlands 5% (representing the Dutch East Indies), and the United Kingdom 5% (representing Burma, Malaya, and other colonies). MacArthur has received this order and is preparing to execute it. This unilateral decision by the US government has been criticized from all sides. According to a TASS dispatch from Sydney: Australian newspapers have fiercely criticized the US move, fully demonstrating its autocratic behavior and substantially violating the Moscow Agreement. (Note: The communiqué of the Moscow Conference of Foreign Ministers of the Soviet Union, Britain, and the United States in December 1945 stipulated that the US government must follow the decisions of the Far Eastern Commission and send instructions through the appropriate US government agencies to the command headquarters for execution.) Such a major matter should be discussed in a special agency by the relevant countries, or it should be left for the peace conference to decide. The Sydney Sunday Telegraph published an article stating: "The US's unilateral decision to dispose of Japanese machinery industry as reparations has already disrupted the situation." According to a United Press report: Moscow Radio stated that the US's reparations policy towards Japan contradicts the Moscow Agreement. The broadcast also accused the US of allowing MacArthur to govern Japan as if it were an American colony.

　　美国政府独断专行
    擅自分配日本赔偿物资
    【新华社陕北二十一日电】综合报导：日前美国政府对日本赔偿问题曾擅自决定，命令麦克阿瑟将日本作为赔偿之用的工业设备划出百分之三十运往要求赔偿之国家作为先期赔偿，其分配之比例为中国得百分之十五，菲律宾百分之五，荷兰百分之五（代表荷印），联合王国百分之五（代表缅甸、马来亚及其他殖民地），麦克阿瑟顷已接获此项命令，准备照令执行。美国政府此一独断专行之决定，已遭到各方抨击。据塔斯社悉尼讯：澳洲各报猛烈抨击美国此举充分表现其独断专行，实质上违反了莫斯科协议。（按：一九四五年十二月苏英美三国外长莫斯科会议公报规定美国政府须依照远东委员会的决策，根据指令然后经美国政府适当的机构送达统帅部执行。）如此重大事情如不能由有关各国在一专设的机构中磋商，则应留待和会决定。悉尼星期电讯报发表论文称：“美国单方处理日本机器工业作为赔偿之决定，已经扰乱了局势。”另据合众社讯：莫斯科广播称：美国对日本之赔偿政策与莫斯科协议相抵触。广播并指责美国允许麦克阿瑟治理日本一如治理一美国殖民地。
