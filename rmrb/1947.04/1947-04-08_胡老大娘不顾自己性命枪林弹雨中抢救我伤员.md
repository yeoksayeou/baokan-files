Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Re-Liao, 6th. Old Woman Hu of Xiawabei Village, Jianping County, Rehe Province, rescued wounded soldiers of the People's Liberation Army in a hail of bullets, disregarding her own life. Last month, when Chiang's troops "swept" western Jianping, Old Woman Hu personally went up the mountain to deliver water and food to the People's Liberation Army. On the morning of the 18th, Old Woman Hu returned from delivering food and saw a wounded soldier crawling forward. Chiang's troops were approaching, and bullets were flying everywhere. Old Woman Hu quickly picked up the wounded soldier and hurried away. She fell several times on the way, and her arm was also seriously injured. Bullets pierced her shoes and trousers, but Old Woman Hu comforted the wounded soldier, saying, "It's okay, as long as I'm here, you'll be fine." She walked more than half a mile before encountering a stretcher. Old Woman Hu's family has five members, who used to make a living by doing needlework. In last year's land reform, they were allocated more than ten mu of land. She often said to people, "The Eighth Route Army are my relatives."

　　胡老大娘不顾自己性命枪林弹雨中抢救我伤员
    【新华社冀热辽六日电】热河建平县下瓦北村胡老大娘，于枪林弹雨中抢救人民解放军伤员。上月蒋军“扫荡”建平西部时，胡老大娘亲自上山，给人民解放军送水送饭。十八日晨，老大娘送饭回来，见该军一伤员匍匐前行，蒋军逼近，子弹横飞，老大娘急将伤员背起急行，途中几次摔倒，手臂亦负重伤，子弹打穿她的鞋与裤腿，老大娘却安慰伤员说：“不要紧，有我就有你。”走出半里多路才遇到担架。胡老大娘家五口人，从前靠做针线过活，去年土地改革中，分得十多亩地，她常对人说：“八路军是她的亲人。”
