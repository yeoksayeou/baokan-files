Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 10th. The fierce offensive launched by the New Fourth Army in Central Jiangsu on the Hai'an-＠-Cha line, a major transportation artery traversing central Jiangsu, victoriously concluded after three days and nights of intense fighting, resulting in the annihilation of over 2,700 Chiang Kai-shek and puppet troops. After the New Fourth Army recovered more than ten strongholds, including the central stronghold of Li Fort on the 3rd, Chiang's troops organized reinforcements from the east and west on the 4th, attempting to retake Li Fort. The eastern route involved transferring elements of the 235th and 237th Regiments of the 79th Brigade of the 49th Division, which were then engaged in "encirclement and suppression" in Rugao East, from Juegang and Matang. Led by the brigade commander himself, they first occupied Fort River Mouth. When they continued their attack on Li Fort, they were ambushed by a unit of the New Fourth Army from three sides, resulting in the annihilation of over 700 enemy troops, with the remnants fleeing back to Fort River Mouth. On the western route, the 105th Brigade of the 49th Division led the 315th Regiment eastward from Lifaqiao along the Hai'an-＠-Cha line towards Dingjiaso, where they were intercepted by the New Fourth Army, resulting in over 500 enemy casualties, including those killed, wounded, and captured. The remnants retreated to the Xichang area. On the 5th, a unit of the New Fourth Army recovered Cha Town, the terminus of the Hai'an-＠-Cha line. Enraged, Chiang's troops attempted to engage the New Fourth Army near Li Fort, under the command of the often-defeated General Wang Tiehan (note: after the division was largely annihilated during the New Fourth Army's seven battles and seven victories in Central Jiangsu last autumn, it was mostly filled with forcibly conscripted soldiers). They launched a two-pronged attack, with the eastern route still consisting of the 79th Brigade, assembling the 235th Regiment and advancing northward from Fort River Mouth, and the western route consisting of the 315th Regiment of the 105th Brigade, supported by a battalion of the 304th Regiment of the 102nd Brigade (transferred from Jiangyan to attack Dingjiaso eastward). When the enemy's eastern route reached Fujia Ferry, three li south of Li Fort, and the western route reached Miaojiazhuang, three li west of Li Fort, the New Fourth Army launched a two-sided attack, inflicting 400 casualties before voluntarily withdrawing from the battle. The entire battle, including the spoils recovered from Li Fort, resulted in the deaths, injuries, and capture of over 2,400 soldiers from the 237th Regiment of the 79th Brigade of the 49th Division of Chiang's army. More than 900 enemy soldiers below the rank of battalion commander were captured. More than 1,500 soldiers below the rank of deputy regimental commander of this unit were killed or wounded; in addition, over 300 Chiang's puppet "Homecoming Corps" were killed or wounded. Seized were ten heavy machine guns, more than fifty various light machine guns, more than ten U.S.-made 82mm mortars and rocket launchers, fifteen grenade launchers, more than 400 rifles and carbines, over 100,000 rounds of ammunition, one radio station, and many other supplies. The heavy towns of Li Fort, ＠ Cha, Xichang, Dingjiaso, Fort River Mouth, Jiaoxiechang and Damatou, Qizaomatou, Zaoershu, Chenhezhuang Laobadou and other large and small eleven strongholds along the line were removed, and more than one hundred large and small bunkers along the line were destroyed. The residents of the three thousand square li of land one hundred li east to west and thirty li north to south along the line regained their liberation, and Chiang's army's plan to completely "suppress" the Hai'an-Taizhou and Hai'an-＠-Cha lines by the end of March was completely bankrupted.
Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 12th. Indigenous Chiang's puppet troops from the Juegang Matang Chahe line in Rugao East County, after successive victories by the People's Liberation Army, have seen 150 people in the past half-month report to the democratic government to start anew. In Wang Yuanyi Township alone, more than 80 people have returned to their hometowns, and Ma Yuling and other self-defense team members in Qili Town have even requested to join the People's Armed Work Team to atone for their crimes. The democratic government has dealt with them leniently, and all those who sincerely return will not be held accountable for their past actions and will be allowed to start anew.
