　　Dashimen's "Backward" Masses Awaken
    Consciously Take the Lead in Thoroughly Overthrowing the Landlord
    [Our Newspaper's Report] Jia Zhouquan, a "backward" peasant from Dashimen, Pingding County, after his thinking was straightened out in the district farmers' training class, embraced great enthusiasm to mobilize the "backward" brothers in his village. Twenty-two "backward" peasants in the village who had not yet turned over formed a large group to recount their grievances. At the first meeting, Jia Zhouquan first recounted that he borrowed ten yuan from the landlord and that his father and three sons worked as long-term laborers, yet a year's labor was not even enough to pay off the interest. Ultimately, his father was forced to flee to Yangquan and has not returned to this day, preventing the family from being reunited. Their tearful accounts moved five people, including Jia Jinming, who also recounted their own suffering, moving the entire group. The next night, during the grievance meeting, an old man named Nie Bingshan, who was deeply superstitious, immediately made the excuse that he was sick and went home when he heard that everyone was going to recount their suffering. After he left, everyone discussed that the old man was afraid to recount his suffering, but to help him awaken and turn over with his poor friends, they unanimously agreed to hold the grievance meeting at his house. As soon as they arrived, the old man was lying on the kang, indicating that he had no opinions. Everyone began to recount their suffering. Jia Quanguo's wife recounted that when she gave milk to the landlord Jia Bai's young child, it was originally agreed that she would only take care of the child and nothing else. However, she ended up serving the family, even emptying the chamber pot. One day, she accidentally broke the chamber pot, and the landlord even beat her. At this point, the woman burst into tears, moving the entire group. Nie Bingshan then sat up, weeping sadly, and said, "Only after hearing the suffering of others did I remember my own suffering. My father worked as a long-term laborer, and his hard-earned money was used to marry me a wife, but she fell ill and died, costing a lot of money. With no other choice, I borrowed forty yuan from the landlord. Later, I couldn't repay it, so I sold my three mu of land to pay off the debt. Without land to cultivate, I had to rent it back, paying six dou of rent rice each year, which, combined with my own hard-earned money, was not enough to pay him back. When building a thatched house for the manager, because rats had dug small holes, water dripped during rain. When the manager saw it, he scolded me for not repairing it properly and immediately took away my bowl, refusing to give me food, and sent me to repair it. ...Speaking of it, I have so many bitter experiences!" His recounting of suffering moved everyone, and one by one, they accused the landlord of their exploitation and bestiality. The twenty people collectively raised one hundred and fourteen opinions and played a leading role in the struggle meeting, inspiring the masses of the entire village to launch a relentless struggle against the landlord, take back their hard-earned money, and thoroughly turn over.
