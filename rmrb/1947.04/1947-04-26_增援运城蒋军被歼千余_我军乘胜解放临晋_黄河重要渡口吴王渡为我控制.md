Xinhua News Agency, Tongpu Front, April 24th Urgent Telegram: The 28th Regiment (less one battalion) of the Tenth Brigade of the Chiang Kai-shek army, which crossed the Tongguan to the north in an attempt to reinforce Yuncheng and seize Yishi, has been annihilated by the Taiyue People's Liberation Army. The People's Liberation Army also took advantage of the victory to liberate Linjin City and the important Yellow River ferry of Wuwangdu between Shaanxi and Shanxi. This is the eleventh county seat liberated by the Taiyue People's Liberation Army since the 5th of this month. After the People's Liberation Army captured Yishi, the Chiang Kai-shek army in Yuncheng was extremely panicked. In order to relieve the siege of Yuncheng, Hu Zongnan even sent the Tenth Brigade of the Xi'an garrison to cross the river north to reinforce and directly attack Yishi. A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army gave a head-on blow and completely annihilated the 28th Regiment headquarters and two battalions that had advanced to Meiyang Town, 20 miles southwest of Yishi, at 13:00 on the 22nd. The Tenth Brigade headquarters and one battalion of the 28th Regiment that had advanced to Linjin City fled upon hearing the news. Linjin City and the important Yellow River ferry of Wuwangdu were then recovered by us. In this battle, more than 1,200 people, including Li Ban, the deputy commander of the 28th Regiment, were captured alive, and two rocket launchers, ten mortars, twelve heavy machine guns, four anti-tank rifles, more than forty Sten submachine guns, and many other guns and military supplies were seized.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi Front, April 24th: The tally of the Northwest People's Liberation Army's seizures from the annihilation of the Chiang Kai-shek army's 135th Brigade is as follows: twenty-four light and heavy mortars, twenty-five 60mm mortars, thirty-eight heavy machine guns, one hundred and eighty-five light machine guns, more than two hundred Sten submachine guns, two thousand rifles, more than two hundred thousand rounds of various bullets, and two hundred and seventy-eight war horses.

This newspaper, Taiyue, April 23rd: All commanders and fighters of a certain unit of the Southern Shanxi People's Liberation Army fully demonstrated the spirit of bravery, tenacity, and hard work in this counter-attack. During the charge against the enemy, Duan Zhengchang, a soldier of the Sixth Company of the Second Battalion, had two fingers on his right hand blown off by enemy bombs, but he continued to fight and threw six grenades in a row until he defeated the enemy. Li Jichao, a soldier of the Ninth Company, captured an enemy alive in the Fen River and seized a machine gun. Liu Xingfu of the Twelfth Company was sick and had not eaten for three days, but he still followed the team closely. His superiors wanted to send him to the hospital to rest, but he refused, saying, "I can still fight." Guo Zhihua, a young soldier in the Second Platoon of the Ninth Company, cried when he saw that others had captured guns but he hadn't. He asked the group leader to not carry a backpack next time so he could go to the front to capture enemy guns, saying, "If I don't capture a gun, I'll be letting Chairman Mao down." When crossing the Fen River at night, the water was waist-deep, and the soldiers waded across. The comrades of the mountain artillery brigade worked even harder. The animals could not cross the water, so the deputy brigade commander, Comrade Jia Wenxian, disassembled the mountain guns and carried them across piece by piece. Everyone went back and forth dozens of times in the Fen River, shivering from the cold, but their spirits remained exceptionally high.
