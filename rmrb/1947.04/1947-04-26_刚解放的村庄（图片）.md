    Newly Liberated Village
    Woodcut by Ai Yan
    In the villages ravaged by Chiang's troops, even the trees were all cut down. This woodcut was carved from the wood felled by Chiang's troops after this village was liberated by our army; although the wood was somewhat damaged during delivery, it allows us to more clearly witness the atrocities of Chiang's troops.

    刚解放的村庄
    艾炎刻
    在蒋军蹂躏过的村庄，连树木都通通砍光。这幅木刻就是在这村庄被我军解放后，用蒋军所砍倒的木头刻出；虽然因为寄递中木头受了一些损坏，却因此使我们更真切的目睹蒋军的暴行。
