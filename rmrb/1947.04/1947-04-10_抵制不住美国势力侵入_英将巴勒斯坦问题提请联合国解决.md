Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 5th. Reports from various sources: The British proposal to request the United Nations to convene a special meeting to discuss the Palestine issue has been agreed upon by the United States, the Soviet Union, and China (Chiang). British representative Jebb delivered the British note to the United Nations Secretariat on the 2nd, formally requesting the speedy convening of this meeting and the establishment of a special committee to study the Palestine issue before the United Nations General Assembly to be held in September. The note stated that the British government will report to the next United Nations General Assembly on its implementation of the old League of Nations mandate over Palestine and will request the General Assembly to make recommendations regarding the future government of Palestine in accordance with Article 10 of the Charter. After receiving this note, the United Nations Secretariat has telegraphed member states to solicit their opinions. If more than half agree, this meeting will be convened within fifteen days, possibly at Lake Success.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 3rd. American interference in the internal affairs of Turkey and Greece has as one of its goals the seizure of huge profits from Middle Eastern oil. According to TASS, Washington: Former oil magnate Mr. Moffett revealed that the Arabian American Oil Company obtained a total of $68 million in excessive profits during the three years of the war. Moffett also presented further evidence before the Senate War Investigating Committee the other day. The chairman of the committee, Republican Brewster, declared: American aid to Greece and Turkey will protect American oil leases in the Middle East, and the government will receive the reward of lower oil prices. The Daily Mirror declared: Due to American oil interests in Saudi Arabia, the US Navy currently obtains one-third of its oil supply from there, which explains the inside story of Truman's interference in the internal affairs of Turkey and Greece.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 4th. TASS, Athens: A local newspaper recently published a report from its Cairo correspondent stating that the United States intends to establish naval and air force bases on Lemnos Island in the Aegean Sea. (Note: Lemnos Island is located in the northern Aegean Sea, closely adjacent to Turkey and Greece on either side, and controls the throat from the Black Sea to the Mediterranean, and can also control the transportation of Bulgaria and Yugoslavia through Greece to the sea.)

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 7th. Reports from various sources: The US Senate Foreign Relations Committee, headed by the notorious Vandenberg, passed Truman's bill to aid the reactionary governments of Greece and Turkey with $400 million on the 3rd, as well as Vandenberg's so-called compromise amendment. The Senate will begin debating the bill this week.

  　英将巴勒斯坦问题提请联合国解决
    【新华社陕北五日电】各方讯：英国请求联合国召开特别会议讨论巴勒斯坦问题之建议，业经美苏中（蒋）法同意，英代表贾德干于二日将英国之照会送达联合国秘书处，正式请求迅速召开此项会议，成立特别委员会，俾在九月间举行之联合国经常大会前研究巴勒斯坦问题，照会中谓，英政府将在下次联合国经常大会上报告其执行旧国联对巴勒斯坦委任任命之经过，并将请求大会依据宪章第十条，提出关于巴勒斯坦未来政府之建议。联合国秘书处接得此一照会后，已电各会员国征求意见，如得半数以上同意，此项会议将于十五日内召开，地点或在成功湖。
    【新华社陕北三日电】美国干涉土希内政，其目的之一在于攫取中东石油的巨利。据塔斯社华盛顿讯：前大石油商墨菲特揭露阿拉伯美国石油公司在战争三年间，共获得六千八百万美元的过分利润，墨菲特并于日前在参院战争调查委员会上提出进一步的证据。该委员会主席共和党党员勃鲁斯特宣称：美国对希、土的援助，将保护美国在中东的石油租借权，而政府则可获得较低石油价格的报酬。每日镜报宣称：由于美国在沙特阿拉伯的石油利益，目前美海军从那里获得三分之一的石油供应，这正说明了杜鲁门干涉土希内政的内幕。
    【新华社陕北四日电】塔斯社雅典讯：此间某报顷发表其开罗访员之报导称：美国意图在爱琴海陵诺斯岛建立海空军基地。（按：陵诺斯岛在爱琴海北部，其左右紧邻土耳其与希腊，扼黑海至地中海之咽喉，且可控制保加利亚与南斯拉夫经希腊出海之交通。）
    【新华社陕北七日电】各方报导：以臭名远扬之范登堡为首的美国参院外委会于三日通过杜鲁门以四亿美元援助希土反动政府的议案及范登堡的所谓折衷修正案。参院将于本周开始辩论该案。
