The land reform in Licheng has been basically and thoroughly completed. Through systematic ideological education and unity campaigns, the relationship between cadres and the masses has been greatly improved. Therefore, the basic demand of the vast majority of farmers in the county is to develop production and become rich. Under the current severe war situation, the general lack of labor throughout the county is a major obstacle to production. Secondly, there is a "cutting the leeks" (short-sighted) and wasteful mentality among prosperous middle peasants and some middle peasants, and some remaining problems (land distribution) in a few villages have not been completely resolved. In view of this situation, the guiding principle of the leadership's current work is: taking the district as a unit, adopting the method of massively training cadres and new and old activists, concentrating the demands of the masses from the bottom up, and combining this with clarifying the production policy from the top down, to mobilize and launch this year's mass production campaign, give play to the creativity of the masses, solve the labor shortage problems caused by participation in the war and production, and use the idea of mobilizing the masses to actively produce and become rich to overcome the "cutting the leeks" and wasteful mentality among some of the masses. Furthermore, in the mobilization and development of mass production, the resolution of remaining land investigation problems (investigation of land distribution and feudal practices) and the mobilization of poor and landless peasants will be implemented to further improve the relationship between cadres and the masses, so as to better carry out this year's mass production campaign. Based on the experience of the first and second district training sessions, the following points are introduced:

    I. Gathering mass demands from the bottom up, combined with clarifying production policies from the top down.

    At the production mobilization meeting of 1,298 village cadres, heroes, and new and old activists (65 old rich peasants, 39 new rich peasants, 250 old middle peasants, 180 new middle peasants, and 364 newly emancipated peasants), the leadership asked: "What exactly do our farmers want to do now?" The resounding answer was: "Develop production and become rich!" Bao Jiajiao’s Wang Shuqun said, "Farmers used to think about land so much that they got sick. Today, although they have been emancipated and have been allocated land, it is still just an empty shell, so they must work hard to develop production." Niu Haiyang, a labor hero from Taipei, said, "The emancipated farmers in my village are reflecting a lack of fertilizer." Everyone said, "Doing business requires capital, and farming requires fertilizer." After Cheng Peiqin, a militiaman from Chengjiashan, proposed that the central task should be to fight Chiang Kai-shek, and that production would be useless if Chiang's army could not be eliminated, Jia Lao Si from Gao Jiajiao immediately replied, "But if we want to defeat Chiang Kai-shek, we must develop production well. Before the troops move, food and grass must go first." After such a heated discussion and debate, everyone realized that developing production and becoming rich is the most essential demand of the vast majority of farmers at present. Comrade Cheng, the secretary of the First District Committee, proposed the slogans "Pull out the roots of poverty and plant the roots of wealth, learn from the new rich peasant Shi Cunjin" and "Combine agriculture and sideline occupations throughout the year, and realize the 'cultivate three, surplus one' for every family," which became everyone's actual actions.

    II. Giving play to the creativity of the masses to overcome labor difficulties.

    After the production policy was clarified this year, some people lacked confidence in mass production due to labor difficulties. Zhang Naiqun, the village head of Dong Luotuo, said, "Participating in the war and supporting the front every day is like a blind man groping for the sky, with no end in sight." Therefore, the leaders, based on the high enthusiasm of the masses for active production, asked everyone to discuss: "What should we do about the labor difficulties in production this year?" Sun Aisheng, a labor hero from Xi Wu, said, "My team has 230 mu of autumn land and 13 and a half male laborers. After precise calculation, some laborers are drawn to drive carts for transportation, and the rest are engaged in agricultural production at home. There is an organized combination of errands, with wages of ten catties of rice per work point (ten points), and unified division of labor, without wasting a single laborer. If both agriculture and sideline occupations can be carried out well, and participation in the war and support of the front can be done well..." Under the spirit of "All labor is well organized, and neither production nor participation in the war will be delayed," everyone unanimously agreed that labor mutual aid should expand the number of households, unify work exchange, unify wages (throughout the year), scientifically divide labor, calculate accurately according to work points, so as not to waste a single laborer, and comprehensively organize to carry out mass production.

    III. Mobilizing and resolving mass thinking, implementing the solution of legacy issues, and rapidly launching mass production

    During the discussion, the village head of Tinghepu said, "This year, I can achieve 'cultivate two, surplus one', so I can just kick back and relax." The leadership asked, "Is it okay not to work hard to universally achieve 'cultivate three, surplus one' this year?" Shi Cunlian from Beiliu said, "Newly emancipated households are buying horses but can't afford saddles, so we have to work hard to achieve 'cultivate three, surplus one'!" Zhang Naiqin (middle peasant) from Libao said, "I calculated that I achieved 'cultivate three, surplus one' after one year of production last year, but the money from the fruit distribution last winter was all spent. I'm glad I didn't sell grain, otherwise the grain would have been sold out long ago." It can be seen that achieving 'cultivate three, surplus one' is not as simple as looking at the accounts; it only counts if there is a real surplus. From this, everyone realized that it is not easy to achieve the production policy, especially for the emancipated households who have difficulties. Secondly, Cao Genhe, the village head of Dongbi Village, said, "Some people in my village think that production is just for eating well and dressing well. For example, when the transportation team went to Changzhi to transport goods, they ate down four restaurants (fried rice with meat) at once, spending 11,100 yuan in foreign currency." Caihua from Xiazhuang followed up, saying, "We must know how to use what we produce. We can't forget the past suffering after we are full. Think about how much we were controlled during the years of famine. We must prevent disasters year after year and thieves night after night!" Shen Dazang from Renzhuang said, "Eating and drinking extravagantly is the fault of the 'cutting the leeks' mentality. We should let everyone in the village know about Shi Cunjin's production and wealth." Finally, Zhang Zhonghe, chairman of the Beiliu Farmers Association, said, "Although we have been allocated more land, we are not at ease hoeing wheat, because we are afraid that the masses will not be able to do it." This immediately drew everyone's attention: "To make a big push for production, we must also combine it with solving legacy issues and further mobilizing the poor and landless peasants from production."

    In short, according to the situation, Licheng should consistently implement the basic spirit of developing production and becoming rich among the broad masses, boldly publicize the direction of Shi Cunjin, let go of democracy to rectify mutual aid organizations, quickly take action to harrow the land, hoe wheat, and transport fertilizer, and insist on implementing the hundred-day textile plan, thoroughly resolving legacy issues from the development of the movement, so as to more forcefully carry out the movement.

    黎城大生产动员经验
    黎城土地改革基本上彻底完成，经过系统思想教育团结运动，干群关系大大改善，因此全县广大农民的基本要求，是生产发家致富。在目前严重的战争情况下，全县劳力普遍缺乏，是进行生产的很大困难。其次在富裕中农与部分中农中，存在着割韭菜及浪费思想，与少数村一些遗留问题（分田）尚未彻底解决。根据此种情况，领导上对目前工作的指导方针是：以区为单位，采取大量集训干部与新旧积极分子的方法，自下而上集中群众要求，结合自上而下明确生产方针，来动员与开展今年大生产运动，发挥群众创造，解决参战与生产的劳力困难，并以发动群众积极生产发家致富思想，来克服部分群众中割韭菜与浪费思想，并在大生产的发动与开展中，贯彻查田遗留问题的解决（查分田与查封建），贯彻对贫雇农的发动，进一步改善干群关系，以便更好的开展今年大生产运动。根据一、二区集训经验介绍如下数点：
    一、自上而下集中群众要求，结合自下而上明确生产方针。
    在村干部英雄与新旧积极分子一千二百九十八人（旧富农六五人，新富农三九人，旧中农二五○人，新中农一八○人，新翻身三六四人）的生产动员大会上，领导上提出：现在咱们农民到底要求干什么以后，响亮的回答是“生产发家”。暴家脚王书群说：“农民过去想土地想成病啦，今天虽然翻了身，分到地，可还是个空架子，非好好生产不行。”台北劳动英雄钮海阳说：“我村翻身农民反映缺乏肥料。”大家说：“做买卖要有本，种地要有肥”。在程家山民兵程培钦提出中心应该打蒋介石，消灭不了蒋军生产下也不顶事以后，高家脚贾老四马上回答：“可是要想打败蒋介石，还得好好生产，兵马不动，粮草先行。”经过这样一番热烈讨论争辩后，大家认识了生产发家致富是当前广大农民的最本质要求。一区分委书记程同志提出：“拔了穷根栽富根，学习新富农石寸金”与“农副业结合贯彻全年，耕三余一家家实现”的口号，变成了大家的实际行动。
    二、发挥群众创造，克服劳力困难。
    今年生产方针明确以后，由于劳力困难，有些人对大生产没信心，东骆驼村长张乃群说：“每天参战支差，和瞎子摸天一样，没边沿。”于是领导者在群众要求积极生产的高度热情上让大家讨论：“今年生产劳力困难该怎办？”西仵劳动英雄孙爱生说：“我组有秋地二百三十亩，男劳力十三个半，经过精确计算，抽走部分劳力赶大车去搞运输，其余在家搞农业生产，有组织的结合差务，按活计工，每工（十分）工资十斤米，统一分工，浪费不了一个劳力，农副业参战支差都能搞好以后，大家在“一切劳力组织好，生产参战误不了”的精神下，一致认为劳力互助应扩大户数，统一变工，统一工资（全年），科学分工，按活计工，处处精确计算，作到不浪费一个劳力，全面组织起来，开展大生产。
    三、发动与解决群众思想，贯彻解决遗留问题，迅速开展大生产
    讨论中，停河铺村长说：“我今年达到耕二余一，逍遥扯蛋就行啦。”领导上提出“今年普遍实现耕三余一不努力行不行”？北流石寸莲说：“新翻身户是买起马置不起鞍，达到耕三余一可得好好努力哩！”李堡张乃芹（中农）说：“我去年生产一年算了算可达到耕三余一啦，可是去冬分得果实钱全花光，才算没有卖粮食，不然粮食早卖光啦。”可见达到耕三余一可不能光从算账上看，真正余下才行。由此大家明确了实现生产方针并不简单，特别是翻身户有困难。其次董壁村长曹根河说：“我村有人认为生产就为好吃好穿，如运输队去长治运脚，一下吃塌四家饭馆（肉炒大米），花洋一万一千一百元。”下庄彩花紧接着说：“会生产还得会使用，不能一饱忘了百饥，想想灾荒年多受制，我们要年年防灾夜夜防贼啊！”仁庄申大赃说：“大吃二喝是割韭菜思想作怪，我们应叫全村人晓得石寸金的生产发家情况。”最后北流农会主席张中河说：“咱虽然分好地多些，可是锄麦也不安心，怕群众不行”。这一下引起大家注意“闹大生产还得结合解决遗留问题，从生产中进一步把贫雇农发动起来”。
    总之，根据情况，黎城应将生产发家致富基本精神一直贯彻到广大群众中去，大胆宣传石寸金方向，放手民主整顿互助组织，迅速行动起来耙地锄麦运肥，并坚持贯彻百日纺织计划，从运动开展中彻底解决遗留问题，以便更有力开展运动。
