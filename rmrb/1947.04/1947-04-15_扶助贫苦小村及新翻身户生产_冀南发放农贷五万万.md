　　To Support Poor Villages and Newly Emancipated Households in Production
    Jinnan Issues 500 Million in Agricultural Loans
    [This newspaper Jinnan 13th dispatch] The Jinnan Administrative Office has issued 500 million yuan in agricultural loans. The loan recipients are focused on areas that have suffered from water and drought disasters in past years, as well as poor villages and dirt-poor farmers who have just obtained land, and poor families of revolutionary martyrs and disabled soldiers. The loans are mainly used to purchase farm tools, livestock, fertilizer, and seeds. The Administrative Office also pointed out that in areas that have already entered production, the loans should be completed before April 15th. In areas where major inspections are underway, they can first be carried out in individual villages and poor and small villages where the major inspection has ended, and must be loaned to the masses by the end of April.
    [This newspaper Jinnan 13th dispatch] Julu County Government has decided to use 15 million yuan in loans to support production in poor villages. In Tieliuzhuang, the Third District, ten households with fifty-two people have only twenty-three male and female full laborers. The entire village has only five *qing* of land, most of which is sandy, saline-alkali land. The masses say, "There is work to do, but no food to eat." The fruit trees on Shagang Ridge have also been largely destroyed by the enemy, and the low-lying areas are flooded year after year, making the villagers' lives very difficult. This time, the Third District first mobilized the villagers to organize, and according to individual needs, eight poor farmers were loaned a total of 94,000 yuan, all of which was invested in production. Village chief Ma Rencheng led four or five people to organize a small factory, which earned more than 20,000 yuan in foreign currency in just over twenty days of operation. After the women received loans, they immediately began to organize and implement mutual assistance. In addition, the village also plans to vigorously restore the fruit tree industry. Yao Zhenhan plans to graft at least forty-five trees this year. They say that within three to five years, they will be able to restore the original state and be full of confidence in "men and women producing together, turning Shagang Ridge into a golden mountain."

　　扶助贫苦小村及新翻身户生产
    冀南发放农贷五万万
    【本报冀南十三日电】冀南行署发放农贷五万万元，贷款对象着重于历年水旱灾区，及贫苦小村与刚获得土地的赤贫农，贫苦军烈属、荣誉军人。贷款主要用于购买农具、牲口、肥料、种籽。行署并指出在已进入生产的地区，四月十五日以前完成贷款。正进行大检查地区，可先在已结束大检查的个别村及贫村、小村进行，务于四月底贷到群众手中。
    【本报冀南十三日电】巨鹿县府决定以一千五百万元贷款，支持贫苦小村生产。三区铁刘庄十户，五十二口人，仅有二十三个男女全劳动力，全村只五顷来地，又多是沙凹碱地，群众说：“有活做没饭吃”。沙岗上果树也多被敌人破坏，凹地连年水淹，村民生活非常贫困。这次贷款，三区首先动员村民组织起来，即根据个人需要，八户贫农共贷到九万四千元，全部投入生产。村长马仁成领导四五人组织了小工厂，开工二十来天，赚洋两万多元。妇女贷款后，即酝酿组织起来，实行互助。此外该村还计划大力恢复果树行。姚振涵计划今年至少要接四十五棵，他们说三、五年内准能恢复原状，充满“男女齐生产，沙岗变金山”的信心。
