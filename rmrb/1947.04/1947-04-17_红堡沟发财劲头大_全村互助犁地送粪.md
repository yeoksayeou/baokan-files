　　[Report from the Taihang Daily in Heshun] Since the production mobilization meeting in Hongbaogou Village, Second District, everyone has had great enthusiasm for getting rich. All twenty-two households in the village have joined mutual aid groups. Within twenty days, they have finished sending all the manure in the village, a total of 8,800 loads. Nine cows and nine old men specialize in plowing the land, and have finished plowing the fields for grain, beans, and corn, totaling 260 mu. Now they are just waiting for sowing. With the time saved, the whole group has raised a total of 50,000 yuan in shares, and sent six livestock and two people to buy hemp in Xingtai. They have already returned from the first trip and have left for the second. Their method of equivalent exchange is to divide the day into ten "xiangs": three "xiangs" in the morning, four "xiangs" in the late morning, and three "xiangs" in the afternoon, with each day worth two and a half "sheng" of rice. A cow plowing land for a day (two cows and one person) is worth 30 points, transporting goods with livestock for a day carrying 100 jin is worth 10 points. The land is cultivated by the mutual aid group and scores are given. The money earned upon return is distributed as dividends according to the money shares. (Qiming)

　　[Report from this newspaper] Tonghui Village, Third District, Wu'an, organized women and children, appropriately allocated manpower and animal power, and enthusiastically launched spring plowing. After the youth of the village joined the army, agricultural association members actively carried out large-scale production in the rear, with manpower and animal power appropriately allocated. Three to five teams of cattle form a group, with one group leader and one secretary per street. Plowing one mu of land is equivalent to one work point. Each day, the group leader reports to the large group leader. They also discussed the order of plowing: (1) first plow for the military families, (2) then plow for the personnel participating in the war, (3) plow for those who are at home. They also organized children's groups to dig field embankments (mutual aid digging), and women who can work deliver food and make "gela" (a type of noodle). The masses enthusiastically guaranteed the completion of the spring plowing task. (Small Newspaper of Third District, Wu'an)
