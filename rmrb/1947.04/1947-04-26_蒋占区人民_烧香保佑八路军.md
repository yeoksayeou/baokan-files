People in KMT-Occupied Areas
    Burn Incense to Bless the Eighth Route Army

　　On the evening of April 1st, our troops were encamped in Yin Village, Yanjin. There was an elderly doctor named Sun Zunsheng, who is now fifty-eight years old. As soon as we entered the courtyard, we saw three red incense sticks inserted in front of the spirit tablet. He and an old woman were kneeling and praying, saying: "Old folks, please bless the Eighth Route Army to win victories. Without the Eighth Route Army, the poor cannot survive." I asked the old man why he was burning incense. He said, "I heard that officer just now asking if borrowed items had been returned. I never thought there would be such a good army in the world. I have lived for fifty-eight years, and this is the first time I have seen such an army. The Central Army told me that the Eighth Route Army are 'bandits.' They attributed the bad things they did to you. The sons of bitches are the real bandits, cursing when they open their mouths, and hitting people when they raise their hands. They have ruled Henan for eight or nine years, taking everything, leaving nothing, and not a single donation could be missed. The common people have learned the 'good' of the Central Army. The Eighth Route Army is so good here, so I burn incense to pray to all the gods. I also boiled a large pot of boiling water, waiting for you!"

　　蒋占区人民
    烧香保佑八路军
    四月一号的傍晚，我军宿营在延津的阴庄，有一年迈的医生，名叫孙樽声，现年五十八岁，我们刚一走进院子，便看见神位前插着红红的三柱香，他和一位老太婆跪着祝祷说：“老人家，保佑八路军打胜仗吧，八路军不来，穷人就不能活啦。”我问老人家为什么烧香？他说：“我听刚才那位官长讲话，问借东西还了没有，真想不到天底下还有这样好的队伍呀，我活了五十八岁，头一次见到的队伍。中央军对我说，八路军是‘土匪’。他们做的坏事情给你们按上啦，狗日们可真是土匪，开口骂，举手打，河南地面经他们统治了八九年，寸草不收，捐款一个不能少，老百姓可认识了中央军的‘好’处啦。八路军来这里这样好，所以我烧香，祝告全神。我还烧了一大锅开水，等待着你们呢！”
