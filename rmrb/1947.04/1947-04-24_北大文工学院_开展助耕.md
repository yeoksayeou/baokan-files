    Peking University Liberal Arts College
    Launches Aid-Agriculture Campaign
    [This newspaper report] On the 17th of this month, Principal Fan issued a notice to all faculty, staff, and students of Peking University, calling on everyone to promote the glorious tradition of serving the people, help the masses thoroughly liberate themselves, become prosperous and wealthy, and support the patriotic self-defense war. In addition to public and private production in various units, all vehicles and personnel should be mobilized to help the villagers stationed in the village with spring plowing, so as to further strengthen the relationship with the masses. Finally, it was pointed out that the targets of aid-agriculture are first and foremost military families and families of martyrs, followed by the elderly and widowed, village cadres, and poor households, and no remuneration should be accepted. Now the Liberal Arts College and the Engineering College have begun to take action, and a warm aid-agriculture movement will soon take shape.
