Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 10th. The people's education and culture undertakings in Taizhou, Dongtai, Baoying and other areas of Central Jiangsu behind Kuomintang enemy lines have persisted in developing through struggle, and have achieved many new innovations. In the Jiangduo district of Taizhou, where the environment is extremely tense, the number of primary schools has increased from more than ten to sixty-two, a fivefold expansion. In a certain township in the Tianbei district of Baoying, there are seven improved private schools, with more than 200 children attending. In a certain village in Dongtai with 180 households, there are two primary schools, and the number of children enrolled accounts for nearly seven-tenths of the total number of school-age children. Dongtai Middle School, in its decentralized teaching, maintains close ties with the masses. The masses voluntarily scout and send intelligence for them; when the enemy goes to the countryside during the day, they have classes at night; when the enemy comes out at noon, they are active in the early morning and evening. In teaching, they have created methods such as "lightning cycle teaching" (rotating to various units for intensive education), correspondence education, and chain teaching (one person teaching another). The content focuses on current affairs and politics closely related to the struggle, disseminating good news, resisting conscription, and at the same time using the method of "learn and spread immediately" to carry out mass education, unite local out-of-school youths, post slogans, win over surrendered personnel to return home, and mobilize the masses to oppose rent reduction struggles. In actual struggle, after students gain rich knowledge of struggle, their enthusiasm for learning is even higher. Even Mr. Xu, who is over fifty years old, enthusiastically participates in learning. He once ran barefoot into the grass fields in heavy snow to scout the situation and cooperated with the armed work team to shout to the enemy near the strongholds. During the Spring Festival, they organized a drama troupe, which performed fifteen times in succession, and helped the masses establish rural drama troupes, write scripts and ditties to cooperate with anti-"encirclement and suppression" mobilization.

　　苏中敌后人民文教事业
    在斗争中发展有新创造
    【新华社华中十日电】苏中泰州、东台、宝应等地蒋后文教事业，在斗争中坚持发展，且有不少新创造。泰州蒋垛区环境极度紧张，该区小学却由十余所增至六十二所，比前扩大五倍。宝应天北区某乡，即有改良学塾七所，求学儿童达二百以上。东台某村一百八十户，有小学两所，入学儿童几占学龄儿童总数十分之七。东台中学在分散教学中，与群众保持密切联系，群众自愿为他们侦察送情报；敌人白天下乡，他们晚上上课，敌人中午出来，他们就早晚活动。在教学上，则创造了闪电轮回教学（轮流到各单位突击教育）、函授教育、连锁教学（一个传一个）等方法，内容着重与斗争密切结合之时事政治及传布捷报、反抓丁，同时用即知即传的方法，进行群众教育，团结地方失学青年，散贴标语，争取自首人员回家，发动群众反倒租斗争。在实际斗争中，学生获得丰富斗争知识后，学习情绪更高，连五十多岁的徐老先生，亦热情的参加学习。他曾在大雪天赤脚跑到草田里侦察情况，配合武工队到据点附近喊话。”春节中，他们组织了话剧队，先后演出十五次，并帮助群众成立农村剧团，编写剧本小调，配合做反“清剿”动员。
