    "Qinghai" Unit Commended for Meritorious Service in Combat
    Taihang Military Region Sends Special Telegram of Praise
    [Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] The leaders of the Taihang Military Region recently sent a telegram to the "Qinghai" Unit, commending the unit for its meritorious service in participating in the Yubei Campaign. The original telegram is as follows:
    Since the "Qinghai" Unit participated in the Yubei Campaign, it has actively carried out every combat mission, and its mass discipline is also good. In the previous Hebi battle, it annihilated a company of the enemy in Kangjia, and in the pursuit battle in Sanjia Village, it eliminated a platoon of the enemy's covering forces. Especially in this Yubei Campaign, when the main force was expanding its gains to the north, the unit blocked more than 3,000 invading enemies from Xin, Hui, and Ji in Chenbao, Lubao, and north of Wangmen on the 4th and 5th, causing the enemy to advance only a little over ten miles in two days, and at a very small cost (15 casualties), it killed and wounded more than 70 enemies. On the 7th, two regiments of the enemy advanced towards the mountainous area south of Tagang. After the enemy occupied our Maya Mountain position, the unit counterattacked and finally repelled the enemy. The enemy left behind more than 20 bodies, and a liaison officer of the enemy's army and air force was captured alive. The above all completed the task of delaying and inflicting casualties on the enemy, and are hereby commended.

    太行军区特电表扬
    【本报特讯】太行军区首长顷致电“青海”部队，表扬该部队参加豫北作战之功绩，原电如下：
    “青海”部队参加豫北作战以来，积极进行每一战斗任务，群众纪律亦好。前鹤壁战役在康家歼敌一连，三家村追击战消灭敌掩护部队一个排，尤其此次豫北战役，当主力向北扩张战果时，该部四、五两日在陈堡鲁堡及王门以北阻击新、辉、汲进犯敌三千余，使敌两天前进仅十余里，并以极小代价（伤亡十五人）毙伤敌七十余。七日敌两个团向塔岗以南方面山地进犯，敌占我马牙山阵地后，该部反扑，终将敌击退，敌遗尸二十余具，生俘敌陆空联络员一名，以上均完成迟滞与杀伤敌人之任务，特予表扬。
