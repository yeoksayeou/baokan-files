　　Military University Personnel Help the Masses with Spring Planting
    Fourth Detachment Helps Plant Sixty-Nine Mu in One Day
    [This Newspaper's Report] The Political Department of the Military and Political University issued a circular to its personnel, instructing them to help the masses with spring planting without accepting any remuneration. The circular pointed out: Before helping with planting, a survey should be conducted of the recipients of assistance, giving priority to the families of revolutionary martyrs, military dependents, and poor peasants. At the same time, village cadres should accurately calculate the allocation of labor to avoid wasting manpower and ensure that one day of assistance is worth a full day's work. In addition, it was stipulated that, with the exception of students busy with graduation, each person in the school should help the masses with spring planting for one day, and the remaining students and staff should help for three days each. Livestock should also be provided to the masses for plowing for three days. In total, this will provide the masses with seven thousand man-days and four hundred livestock-days of labor. Currently, in the dozen or so villages and fields surrounding the school's location, personnel and livestock from the Military and Political University can be seen everywhere, plowing fields, hauling manure, pulling plows, and repairing dikes for the masses. Cadres and students are having cordial discussions with the villagers about agricultural matters during their labor. The villagers are saying one after another: "This is truly an army that serves the people. If we, the common people, do not produce well, we will truly be letting down the Eighth Route Army!"
    [Another Report] To respond to the call of the Political Department, cadres, students, staff, and livestock of the Fourth Detachment of the Military University, mobilized fully in the wind and sand all day to help the villagers in the stationed village with spring planting. In one day, they helped thirty-two families of revolutionary martyrs, cadres, and the elderly and widowed without labor in the entire village, plowing sixty-nine mu of land (men pulling plows), hauling fifty-five large carts of manure, and spreading four large carts of manure. Comrade Song Tie-zheng, the deputy squad leader, took off his shoes and socks and led the entire squad in plowing all day barefoot. Comrade Li Guangrui of the Seventeenth Squad felt a burning pain from the rope pulling on his red and swollen shoulder. He touched it with his hand and said, "It doesn't matter! Today I truly realized how hard-earned the millet is!" Comrade Li Ying-dou, who had never worked before, pulled a plow for a whole day without letting anyone replace him. Comrade Ge Hai-fa, a young comrade covered in sores, also actively participated. After an old woman, who was helped by the Sixteenth Squad, bought some peanuts and cigarettes and was refused by everyone, she felt very sorry and said: "In the past, when the land was barren, no one cared! Eighth Route Army comrades are using people to plow the land for us. I have lived for more than seventy years and have never seen such a good troop!" The villagers who were helped by the Second and Fourth Squads of the Seventeenth Squad repeatedly sent cigarettes and peanuts, but the comrades resolutely refused to eat them. They put them on the ground and ran away! While running, they said: "Let's see if you eat them now?!" But the comrades still did not touch them at all and asked the detachment to forward them to the villagers.

　　军大全体人员帮助群众春耕
    四大队一天助耕六十九亩
    【本报讯】军政大学政治部通令所属人员，不受任何报酬帮助群众春耕。通令指出：助耕前应调查帮助对象，先帮助烈属、军属及贫苦农民。同时要和村干部精确计算劳动力的分配，免得浪费劳力，做到帮助一天就顶一天的事。此外规定全校除忙于毕业的学员，每人帮助群众春耕一天外，其余留校学员和干杂人员，每人帮助三天，牲口也给群众耕地三天。总计共可帮助群众七千个人工，四百个牲口工。现该校驻地周围十几个村庄、田野里，到处可以看到军政大学的人员牲口给群众耕地、拉粪、拉犁、修堰、干部同学在劳作中亲切的和老乡谈论农事，老乡们纷纷说：“这才是真正为老百姓办事的军队，咱们老百姓不好好生产，真对不起八路军！”
    【又讯】为响应政治部号召，军大四大队干部学员事务人员及牲口在整天的风沙中，全体动员帮助驻村老乡春耕。一天共帮助了全村抗烈干属及孤寡无劳力者卅二家，犁地六十九亩（人拉犁）共推粪五十五大车，撒粪四大车。副班长宋铁铮同志把鞋袜都脱光，赤着脚带领全班同学犁了整一天。十七队李光瑞同志，肩背被绳子拉的红肿，火刺刺地疼，他用手一摸，说：“没有关系！今天真体会到小米来的不容易呀！”从来没有劳动过的李应斗同志整整拉了一天犁，也不让别人替换。满身是疮的葛海发小同志，也积极的参加了。十六队帮助的一位老太太买了点花生纸烟被大家谢绝以后，她十分过意不去说：“过去把地荒啦，也没人管！八路军同志给俺用人犁地，俺活了七十多岁啦，真没有见过你们这样的好队伍！”十七队二、四班帮助的老乡，几次给送烟、送花生，同志们都坚决的不吃，他放到地里就跑啦！一边跑一边说：“这下看你们吃不吃？！”可是同志们仍一点也没有动，托队部又转送给老乡了。
