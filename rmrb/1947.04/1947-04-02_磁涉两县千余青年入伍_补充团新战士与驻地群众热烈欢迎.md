The Third Regiment of the Military Region's Reinforcement Corps received over a thousand outstanding youths from Ci and She counties this time. They are almost all liberated workers and peasants, so their level of awareness is very high. The new recruits of the Fifth District of Ci County, Third Battalion, were the first to arrive at the garrison. Regardless of their fatigue, they immediately began preparing Yangko dance programs to welcome the new recruits arriving later. The next day and the day after, they used Yangko dances to welcome the new recruits from the Sixth and Ninth Districts of Ci County. The new recruits from the Sixth and Ninth Districts also used the same enthusiasm to organize a Yangko team for the entire battalion, using their rest time outside of drills, to prepare to welcome the new recruits from She County. The local people actively prepared for the welcome, with colorful decorations adorning every street. On the afternoon of the 25th, the welcoming teams composed of villagers and new recruits merged into a torrent of over a thousand people, first receiving the early-arriving new recruits of the Second Battalion into the village. After performing the consolation program, they rushed to welcome the First Battalion's team. When the First Battalion's team appeared at the west end of the village, the Yangko team immediately went a mile out of the suburbs to meet them. Children ran all over the mountains and fields to report the team's movements. As the team merged with the Yangko team, the masses' Yangko gongs and drums led the way, and the new recruits' Yangko team sent them off from behind. The new recruits were all sticking out their chests, raising their heads, and their steps were particularly neat and powerful, just like veteran troops. Because they are all liberated people, they all have red faces and are full of joy. Coupled with the strong physique of the working people, the team looks particularly majestic. Encouraged by the enthusiasm of the welcomers, many soldiers danced Yangko on the rugged mountain road to the rhythm of the Yangko gongs and drums. When the team passed through the ranks of the welcomers, the new recruits, who had only enlisted for one or two days, also shouted slogans such as "Welcome new recruits!" and "It is most glorious to join the people's soldiers!"

The team entered the pre-arranged venue, and the Yangko team composed of new recruits immediately performed a Yangko program with extremely rich content. Then, the elementary school's Yangko team also performed stilt walking and Yangko, singing their newly composed songs: "Welcome new recruits to come for training...". At the welcome meeting of the Second Battalion, all the liberated women changed into new clothes and twisted Yangko to comfort their protectors—the new members of General Liu Bocheng's troops, the people's soldiers. There were also many women with bound feet inside, struggling to dance. In the fast pace of the gongs and drums, they almost used all their strength to keep up. They sang: "You love me, I love you; the army and the people are one family, don't be polite... I'll mend your clothes if they're torn, and wash them if they're dirty..." The new recruits completely forgot the fatigue of trekking over seventy miles of mountain roads. During each program performance, the soldiers constantly applauded.

　　磁涉两县千余青年入伍
    补充团新战士与驻地群众热烈欢迎
    【本报讯】军区补充第三团，这次接收磁、涉两县的优秀青年千余入伍。他们几乎全是翻了身的工农，所以觉悟程度很高。三营磁县五区的新战士，首先到达驻地，他们不顾自己的疲劳，立即准备起欢迎后到的新战士的秧歌节目来。第二天、第三天，即用秧歌迎接了磁县六、九区的新战士。六、九区的新战士也以同样的热情，抽出操课以外的休息时间，组织了全营的秧歌队，准备欢迎涉县的新战士。驻地群众积极筹备欢迎，每条街都扎着彩。二十五日下午，老乡与新战士组成的欢迎队伍汇合成千余人的巨流，先把早到的二营新战士接进村，演完了慰劳节目，又急忙去迎接一营的队伍。当第一营的队伍出现在村西头时，秧歌队即到一里地郊外去迎，小孩子满山遍野地跑来跑去报告队伍行动的消息。队伍与秧歌队汇合了，群众的秧歌锣鼓即在前引导，新战士的秧歌队在后欢送。新战士们一个个都挺着胸，昂着头，步伐也格外整齐有力，像老队伍一样。因为他们都是翻了身的人，所以一个个都是红光满脸，喜气洋洋。配上劳动人民的壮实体格，使队伍显得格外雄壮。他们为欢迎者的热情所鼓舞，很多战士都随着秧歌锣鼓的节奏，在崎岖的山路上跳起秧歌舞来。当队伍通过欢迎者的行列时，入伍才一二天的新战士也喊出了“欢迎新战士！”“参加子弟兵最光荣！”等口号。
    队伍进到预先布置的会场，由新战士组成的秧歌队立刻演出了内容极其丰富的秧歌节目，接着小学校的秧歌队也演出了高跷与秧歌，唱着他们新编的歌子：“欢迎新战士来受训………”。在第二营的欢迎会上，翻身妇女全体换了新衣服，扭着秧歌来慰劳她们的保卫者——刘伯承将军部下的子弟兵的新成员。里边还有许多小脚妇女，也吃力地在跳着，在锣鼓喧天的快步时，她们几乎是用了全部力量跟了上去，她们唱：“你呀爱护我呀，我呀爱护你；军民本是一家呀，您不要客气。………衣服破了我缝，脏了我给洗……”新战士完全忘记了七十多里山路跋涉的疲劳，在每个节目演出时，战士们都不断的拍手叫好。
