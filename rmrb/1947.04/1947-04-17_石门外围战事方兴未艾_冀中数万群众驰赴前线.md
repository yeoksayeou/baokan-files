　　Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 15th: A correspondent at the front reports: As soon as the self-defense counterattack on the outskirts of Shijiazhuang began, tens of thousands of people from Gaocheng, Jin, Luancheng, Shulu, and Wuji counties in central Hebei enthusiastically rushed to the front lines to help the army kill the enemy. They tirelessly transported war materials and rescued the wounded day and night along hundreds of miles of transportation lines around the battlefield. More than a thousand farmers from An'guo County, 200 miles from the front lines, also rushed to the scene overnight. The people of Jin, Gao, and other counties organized accompanying army cooperatives, using 250 carts to carry large quantities of rice, flour, and fodder to supply the army.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 15th: The Jin-Cha-Ji Daily commented on the great victory on the outskirts of Shijiazhuang on the 14th, stating: The victory on the outskirts of Shijiazhuang and the victory of the People's Liberation Army of Chahar in capturing Dushikou, Pingdingbao, and Fanshanbao nine days ago echo each other from north to south. But this is just the beginning of a new and great victory for our Jin-Cha-Ji people in self-defense. The situation that Chiang Kai-shek is getting weaker and weaker with each fight, while our army is getting stronger and stronger, is once again demonstrated. Shijiazhuang, this strategic point, had strong fortifications built during the Japanese occupation. After Chiang's and Hu's troops "took over" from the Japanese, they strengthened these fortifications, but in front of the heroic People's Liberation Army, they still could not escape the fate of being annihilated. Hu Zongnan's direct line, the Third Army, and its running dog, the traitor Hou Ruyong's unit, have already lost tens of thousands of men at the beginning of the campaign, and the consequences are extremely obvious. The editorial calls on the military and civilians of the entire border area to launch a larger-scale competition to kill the enemy and make meritorious contributions, and to enthusiastically support the victory at the front.

### 石门外围战事方兴未艾  冀中数万群众驰赴前线

　　石门外围战事方兴未艾
    冀中数万群众驰赴前线
    【新华社晋察冀十五日电】随军记者报导：石门外围自卫反击战刚一开始，冀中藁城、晋县、栾城、束鹿、无极等数万群众即热烈奔赴前线，助军杀敌，于战场周围长达数百里之交通线上，昼夜不停的转送作战物资与救护伤员。远距战线二百里之安国县，千余农民亦星夜赶来。晋、藁等县群众并组织有随军合作社，以大车二百五十辆，携带大批米、面、草料随军供给。
    【新华社晋察冀十五日电】晋察冀日报于十四日评石家庄外围大捷称：石家庄外围的胜利，和九天前察哈尔人民解放军攻克独石口、平定堡、矾山堡的胜利南北辉映。但这还只是我晋察冀人民新的自卫伟大胜利的开始。蒋介石越打越弱，和我军越打越强的形势，就又一次表现出来。石家庄这个战略要点，在日寇占领期间就构筑了坚强的防御工事，蒋胡军从日寇手里“接防”后，又加强了这些工事，但在英勇的人民解放军面前，还是不能逃脱被歼的命运。胡宗南嫡系第三军及其走狗汉奸侯如墉部，在战役开始已丧失了万人之众，其后果是极为明显的。社论号召全边区军民掀起更大规模的杀敌立功竞赛，热烈支援前线的胜利。
