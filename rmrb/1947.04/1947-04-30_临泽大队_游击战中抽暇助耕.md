Linze Brigade
    Spare Time from Guerrilla Warfare to Help with Plowing
    [This Dispatch] The Jilu-Yu Linze Brigade, amidst intense guerrilla warfare, still finds time to help the masses with spring plowing. On April 1st, during their rest period after a battle, they assisted the spring plowing in ×× Village, organizing themselves into groups to pull plows for the masses. Political Commissar Du of the brigade, holding the plow handles, bent over and plowed one row after another. Company Commander Dong, head down, spread manure with a shovel. The masses were deeply moved by the spirit of their troops. An old man in his fifties said, "These two mu of land were only returned to me thanks to the land reform carried out by the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. Now the Eighth Route Army is helping to pull the plow and plant the land. Our Chairman Mao and the Eighth Route Army are so good to the people!"

    游击战中抽暇助耕
    【本报讯】冀鲁豫临泽大队，在紧张的游击战中，仍抽暇帮助群众春耕。四月一日，是他们打完仗休息的时候，他们又帮助××村春耕，组织成一组组的，给群众拉犁。大队杜政委，扶着犁把，弯着腰，一趟一趟的犁着。董连长低着头，拿着铁锹，在撒粪。群众对自己的队伍这种精神，很受感动。一个五十多岁的老大爷说：“这二亩地，是共产党、毛主席实行土地改革，我才收回来的，八路军又来帮助拉犁种地，咱们的毛主席、八路军，对待老百姓真好！”
