　　Two Problems in the Production Movement
    Taihang Third Special District Office
        I. Ideological Mobilization is the First Hurdle
    After the land reform, the rural relations of production have undergone fundamental changes. Farmers have obtained the means of production, their ideological awareness has been unprecedentedly enhanced, and they are eager to become rich. However, at present, there is a fairly common "want to get rich but dare not get rich" mentality among farmers. If this ideological contradiction cannot be resolved quickly, it will be a distress for the farmers themselves and a major obstacle to carrying out this year's great production and enabling farmers to establish a solid foundation for prosperity. A middle peasant in Nanquan Village, Changzhi, said: "One cannot but work, but dare not work too hard; eating well and dressing well is a gain." A middle peasant named ××× in Huangzhangdi, Huguan, sold his donkey and sheep and spent lavishly, saying: "If you dare to get rich, it is not difficult to cultivate two days and rest one day; it is just that I don't dare." Wang Yangsuo, the production director of Jiajiazhuang, earned more than 40,000 yuan from three transportation trips, but he refused to pay off his debts and instead wasted 5,000 or 6,000 yuan on meat and noodles in just a few days. He said it was better to have some debts (external debts). Cao Linshui, a hero of the land reform in Changzhi, said: "I am very willing to get rich, but I dare not stand out from the masses. I am afraid that others will say that I am selfish. Last autumn, I harvested more than 50 stones of grain, and I felt uneasy. I voluntarily lent grain to the masses, and I dare not reclaim wasteland or invest more in the cooperative."
    Although the "hesitant to get rich" mentality is the same in that people dare not get rich, the forms of expression and the roots of its emergence are different. Old middle peasants are mainly afraid of being "cut down to size" and being struggled against, believing that if the landlords, feudal elements, and rich peasants are overthrown, they will not be secure. Newly liberated peasants are afraid of climbing over the bumps and hollows, and fantasize about communism. Village cadres are mainly concerned with "everyone getting rich together" and afraid of "revealing themselves." The source of this thinking is mostly due to misconceptions about the policy of "land to the tiller, leveling the rich and poor," or a lack of understanding of the laws of social development and random speculation. Some are also caused by individual cases of middle peasants being struggled against and the gap between rich and poor not being filled.
    From the perspective of the essence of farmers' thinking, "wanting to get rich" is fundamental, and daring not to get rich is a kind of concern and doubt. They are "half-believing and half-doubting," afraid to speak out, but unafraid once they start doing it. Especially if everyone moves together to form a movement to get rich, this concern will be reduced or shattered for a while, but it does not mean a complete solution. It must be recognized that this is a natural phenomenon in the process of two revolutionary transformations; although it is not the farmers' essential thinking, it is the farmers' real ideological contradiction.
    Therefore, the first hurdle in launching this year's great production movement must be to firmly resolve this ideological contradiction among farmers, enlighten farmers to consciously eradicate poverty and establish a foundation for prosperity, clarify the future of getting rich (that is, the future of society), and encourage farmers' confidence and courage to get rich. To do this, we must launch a great ideological mobilization like the mobilization for the land reform struggle. It is difficult to break through this ideological barrier with simple appeals and mobilizations alone.
    Preliminary experience in ideological mobilization: First of all, we must widely mobilize active elements (including cadres) and backward elements so that farmers can use their own experiences and wisdom to dispel their concerns and work together to get rich. Recently, after Changzhi held a major production mobilization meeting with more than 600 people from the county, district, and village levels, each district trained a large number of active and backward elements. An average of 20 to 30 people participated in each village. Once these people's thinking is straightened out, they will immediately become the yeast in the production movement and mobilize the masses.
    Secondly, education should be carried out according to different ideological sources, which is also the "treating the root cause" in the land reform movement. During the production mobilization, Lucheng proposed to resolutely investigate loopholes and compensate for the losses of middle peasants. Changzhi definitely announced that getting rich through labor will never be struggled against, leveling the rich and poor will only happen once. In the class division symposium in Qiaoshang, Huguan Sixth District, middle peasants discussed who exactly are being struggled against; poor peasants discussed how the fruits of labor come about and whether it is right to rely on struggle for food; landlords discussed why they were struggled against and what to do in the future. It is necessary to clarify from the essence of class that the struggle is against feudalism, not against wealth. It is useless to talk empty principles without addressing the root of the ideological problem.
    Finally, the ideological mobilization in the production movement, like the land reform movement, cannot be divided into stages. It must be carried out in conjunction with ideological mobilization and production action, gradually resolving ideological problems and consolidating the production movement in the movement. Today, the proportion of liberated farmers is very large. What is required is "everyone getting rich together." If everyone can truly take action enthusiastically, there will be fewer concerns.
            II. Overcoming Labor Shortages is the Main Link to Guarantee Victory in War and Production
    After eliminating the ideological obstacles to getting rich, the lack of labor and livestock has become the main problem in various places that has led to a loss of confidence in the "cultivate three days rest one" system. In fact, due to participation in the army, war, and the development of comprehensive production, the main force of agricultural production (male full laborers) will inevitably decrease, which has become the general trend for the future. For example, in Xiwang Village, Lucheng, out of 173 male full laborers in the entire village, 22 have joined the army, 85 are coal miners, and 11 are working outside, leaving only 75 male full laborers, each of whom averages 40 mu of land. In Lucheng Fourth District, there are more than 5,000 workers, accounting for one-sixth of the district's population. According to the statistics of sideline production in 34 villages, there are 34 flour mills, 26 tofu workshops, 22 vinegar workshops, 12 dyeing workshops, and 111 mobile cotton ginners, which also occupy a lot of labor. In order to defeat Chiang Kai-shek, this year's participation in the war will inevitably run through the whole year. Therefore, how to overcome the difficulty of labor shortage has become an important link to ensure the victory of the front and the increased production (comprehensive) of the rear.
    Over the past few years, the old liberated areas have provided us with a lot of experience in overcoming labor difficulties, and individual villages in the new liberated areas have initially found the way. These experiences still need to be greatly promoted and continued to be created.
    (1) Expand the labor pool and organize women, children, and old men and other semi-auxiliary laborers to participate in production. In the spring of 1945, Ping Shun launched a 40-day campaign to eliminate locusts with tens of thousands of people. If women and children were not organized, the seeds could not have been sown. In the autumn of the same year, during the Shangdang Campaign, those old liberated areas of Li, Ping, Lu, and Hu, where the labor pool was expanded and fully organized, were able to participate in the war, harvest the autumn crops, and plant wheat. Recently, Nanzhuang in Changzhi Second District did an accounting. If only male full laborers are considered, each person needs to cultivate 30 mu of land. If semi-laborers are included, it is equivalent to one full laborer cultivating only 18 mu. If women and children are also included, each equivalent laborer will only cultivate an average of 10 mu of land. Xiguxian organized 80 women and children, who delivered manure to all the fields of 58 military dependents' households in two days.
    In the new liberated areas, this is not easy. First of all, it is necessary to break the idea of men underestimating women and children and women relying on men, and to achieve equivalent and reasonable work points and accounting, in order to give full play to their initiative.
    (2) Try every means to develop the people's strength, so that everyone can do their best and exert their strength. To do this, we must first have a scientific organization to combine agriculture, sideline industries, and participation in the war, with unified leadership and unified mutual aid. Sun Aisheng, a labor hero in Xiwu, Licheng, organized 13 semi-laborers, drew three people to specialize in transportation, and the rest were responsible for farming, participating in the war, and supporting the front. They had unified leadership and accounted for work according to the task, with unified wages. They confidently said: "With all the labor organized well, production and participation in the war will not be a loss." After accounting and ideologically mobilizing, the 95 households in Jingliang Temple, Changzhi First District, sold elm noodles and used more than 50 laborers. The cooperative organized them in a unified manner, with three people going out to buy elm bark, distributing it to each household to grind noodles, and six people specializing in selling elm noodles, with unified accounting of work points and profit sharing. This saved a lot of labor and made more money. Secondly, reasonable accounting of work points and equivalent profit sharing is the determining factor in developing the people's strength. Licheng implemented work point evaluation and top differences based on load and mileage in supporting the front and volunteer transportation, breaking the view of coping with supporting the front. Some people even took on transportation when they came back from supporting the front to avoid running empty. After Ren Zhuang unified the accounting of work points and profit sharing for production and participation in the war, old men in their 60s also scrambled to support the front. After Changzhi Nantianhe decided on the method of returning labor for participation in the war, everyone actively accumulated fertilizer and repaired land for those participating in the war. The masses said that they were not afraid of participating in the war this way. Thirdly, squeezing out labor and reducing waste. This work must be consciously organized. For example, the 14 small cooperatives in Xiguxian used to occupy 40 full laborers. After the establishment of a management committee for unified leadership, similar businesses were merged and semi-laborers were recruited to participate. This reduced expenses without reducing income, saving 23 full laborers. In the new liberated areas, cadres' delays due to excessive meetings and waiting are still quite serious. Leadership institutions should be improved, work should be scientifically divided, and all possible labor and time should be saved and invested in production.
    In addition, a few issues must be paid attention to: For example, in large-scale mutual aid between the front and rear, in addition to balancing labor repayment in the whole village, we must also have the concept of preparing for war at all times, doing what should be done and what can be done in advance, and ensuring that after the participants leave, work is done as soon as possible and families in difficulty are taken care of, so that they can rest assured at the front, change shifts less, and the rear does not reduce production. Secondly, the relationship between workers and peasants must be taken care of, paying attention to the interests of both workers and peasants. Workers should bear some price differences appropriately, and farmers should ensure that the land is cultivated well on their behalf. Furthermore, counties and districts must pay attention to the adjustment of the people's burden, so that areas with severe labor shortages and heavy tasks can receive help from other villages and districts. Finally, in the entire process of overcoming labor difficulties, cadres must have accurate calculation and a mass line work style. From accurate calculation, we must correctly recognize the degree of labor difficulty, and to solve the difficulty, we must guide the masses to overcome it themselves, think of ways, and it is not easy to make the method of package substitution and regulation work.

　　生产运动中的两个问题
    太行三专署办公室
        一、思想发动是第一关
    土地改革后，农村生产关系起了根本变化，农民获得生产资本，思想觉悟空前提高，迫切要求发家致富。但在目前农民在思想上，却相当普遍的存在“想发家又不敢发家”的疙瘩户思想，这个思想矛盾如不能很快解决，在农民本身是个苦恼，对开展今年大生产使农民安下富根，也是绝大障碍。长治南泉庄一个中农说：“不能不劳动，不敢很劳动，好吃好穿是赚头。”壶关黄漳底中农×××卖驴、卖羊，大吃大花，他说：“要敢发家就耕二余一也不难；就是不敢。”焦家庄生产主任王羊锁运输三次赚了四万余元，不肯还完外债，却买肉买面不几天浪费了五、六千元，他说还是有些饥荒（外债）好。长治翻身英雄曹林水说：“我很愿发家，就是不敢高出群众，怕别人说咱自私自利，去秋收粮五十多石，便想不通了，给群众自动借粮，想开荒又不敢开，也不敢多向合作社投资。”
    疙瘩户思想，虽同样是不敢发家，但表现形式与产生根源，却有不同。老中农主要是怕割韭菜、怕斗，认为地主封建富农垮了，自己就不保险，新翻身的农民是怕爬平填圪道，幻想共产，村干部主要是“要发一齐发”怕“露出自己”；这种思想来源，多由于对“耕者有其田、填平补齐”政策发生错觉，或不懂社会发展规律，随便猜测，也有的是因中农被斗，圪道户一直填的个别现象所引起的。
    从农民思想本质上研究，“想发家”是基本的，不敢发是一种顾虑与怀疑。是“二恍二惚”的，说起来就害怕，干开了他就不怕，特别是如果大家都动起来形成发家运动，这种顾虑一时会减少或破灭，但不等于彻底解决，必须认识这是两个革命转化过程中必然的现象；虽非农民本质思想，却是农民的现实思想矛盾。
    因此，开展今年大生产运动第一关就必须抓紧解决农民这个思想矛盾，启发农民拔穷根安富根的生产发家自觉，明确发家前途（即社会前途），鼓舞农民的发家信心和勇气。想这样就必须像发动翻身斗争那样，来个思想大发动，只有简单的号召动员，就很难打破这个思想障碍。
    思想发动的初步经验：首先必须广泛动员积极层（包括干部）和落后层，使农民用自己的体会和智慧，解除自己顾虑，齐心发家。长治最近在县区村六百余人的生产大动员后，各区又大批训练积极层与落后层，一个村平均有二、三十人参加，这些人思想通了，马上会成为生产运动中的酵母，把群众发动起来。
    其次是根据不同思想根源，进行教育，也即翻身运动中的“抓心病”“对症下药”。生产动员中，潞城提出坚决查漏洞，补偿中农损失。长治肯定宣布劳动起家绝不斗争，填平只有一次，壶关六区桥上划分阶级座谈中，中农讨论斗争的倒底是那些人；贫农讨论果实怎样来，靠吃斗争饭对不对；地主讨论为啥斗咱，今后怎干。从阶级本质上明确是斗封建，不是斗富，离开思想病根讲空道理不顶事。
    最后生产运动中的思想发动也和翻身运动一样，不能划分阶段，必须是思想发动与生产行动结合进行，在运动中逐渐解决思想问题，巩固生产运动，今天翻身农民的比重很大。要求的是“要发大家发”，真正轰轰烈烈能行动起来，顾虑也就少了。
            二、克服劳力困难是保证战争生产胜利的主要环节
    解除了发家思想障碍之后，劳畜力的缺乏，就成为各地对耕三余一失掉信心的主要难题。事实上由于参军，参战发展全面生产，农业生产的主力（男全劳力）势必减少，已成今后的总趋向。如潞城西旺村全村一百七十三个男全劳力，参军二十二，下煤窑工人八十五，其他外出十一，仅余七十五个男全劳力，每人即平均种地四十亩。潞城四区光工人达五千人以上，占全区人口六分之一。又据卅四村的副业生产统计，计粉坊三十四座，豆腐坊二十六座，醋坊二十二座，染坊十二座，流动弹花工人一百一十一个，也占了不少劳力。为了打败蒋介石，今年的参战又势必贯穿全年。因此，如何克服劳力缺乏的困难，便成为保证前方胜利后方增产（全面的）的重要环节。
    克服劳力困难，几年来老区已给我们提供了不少的经验，新区有个别村庄初步找到门径，这些经验还须大大发扬与继续创造。
    （一）扩大劳力圈，把妇女、儿童、老汉等半辅劳力都组织起来，卷入生产。平顺四五年春，持续四十天的万人灭蝗运动，如果不组织妇女、儿童就下不了种。同年秋季上党战役中，黎、平、潞、壶老区那些地区扩大了劳力圈、全面组织起来，那里就做到参了战、收了秋也种了麦。最近长治二区南庄算了个账，光男全劳力每人需种地三十亩，把半劳力算进去，折合一个全劳力只用种十八亩，如在把妇儿算上。每个折合劳力就只平均种十亩地了。西故县组织起八十个妇女儿童，两天内给五十八户军属把粪土全部送到地里。
    在新区这件事也不太容易，首先要打破男人轻视妇女儿童和妇女依靠男人的思想，并做到折工计分的等价合理，才能发挥其积极性。
    （二）想尽办法发扬民力，做到人尽其才、人尽其力，要如此，首先须有科学的组织，使农业副业参战结合起来，统一领导，统一变工。黎城西仵劳英孙爱生组织十三个半劳力，抽出三人专搞运输，其余的负责种地，参战支差，统一领导，按活计工，统一工资，他们有信心的说：“一切劳力组织好生产参战输不了。”长治一区井良寺九十五户卖榆面用五十多个劳力，经过算账打通思想，由合作社统一组织起来，由三人出外买榆树皮，分散各户磨面，六个专营卖榆面，统一计工分红，这样节省了好多劳力，赚钱也多。其次合理的计工等价分红，是发扬民力的决定因素。黎城在支差义运上实行按负重、里程评分顶差，打破了支差应付观点，有的支差回来捎运输不跑空路。仁庄生产参战统一计工分红后，六十多岁的老汉也抢着支差。长治南天河决定了参战还工办法后，大家都积极给参战者积肥修地，群众说这样咱也不怕参战了。再次挤劳力减少浪费，这个工作必须有意识去组织。如西故县十四个小型合作社，以前占了四十个全劳力，经成立经理委员会统一领导后，合并同类业务，吸收半劳力参加，这样减少开支，又不减少收入，节省出二十三个全劳力，在新区干部误工多开会多等浪费现象还相当严重，应健全领导机构，科学分工，把可能节省的劳力和时间，完全节约出来，投入生产。
    此外有几个问题必须注意：如前后方大变工，除全村劳力平衡还工，还须要时刻准备参战观念，把应该做可能做的生活提前做了，参战者走后保证尽先做活，照顾家庭困难，使其在前方安心，少换班，后方不减少生产。其次是工农关系问题，必须注意照顾工农双方利益。工人适当负担一些差价，农民保证把地代耕好。再次是县区必须注意民力负担的调剂，使劳力奇缺差务繁重地区得到外村外区帮助，最后在整个克服劳力困难中，干部须具有精确计算和群众路线作风，从精确计算中，正确认识劳力困难程度，而解决困难必须是引导群众自行克服，想办法，包办代替规定办法是不容易行通的。
