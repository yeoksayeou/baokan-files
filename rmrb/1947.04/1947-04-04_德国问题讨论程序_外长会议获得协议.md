　　German Question Discussion Procedure
    Foreign Ministers Meeting Obtains Agreement
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st] According to TASS, Moscow: At the Four Foreign Ministers Meeting on March 29th, chaired by Molotov, further discussions were held regarding the proposed procedure for examining the Allied Control Council's report on Germany. Previously, the American delegation proposed that further discussion of this report should be limited to the following three issues: Firstly, the issue of Germany's economic unification; secondly, the level of industrial production and reparations payments in Germany; and thirdly, the structure and nature of Germany's interim government. The remaining issues should be reviewed by a special committee. Today, Molotov suggested that items one and two in the American proposal could be merged into one item, and a new issue added, namely, the elimination of the remnants of militarism. Marshall agreed to merge the first and second items, but expressed doubt as to whether the issue of eliminating the remnants of German militarism was appropriate. However, he stated that the American delegation did not, in principle, object to including this issue in the agenda. The four foreign ministers decided, in accordance with the Soviet delegation's suggestion, to formally stipulate the first issue as follows: to regard Germany as an economic unified entity, including reparations and revising the level of industry. The Soviet delegation did not insist on including the issue of eliminating the remnants of militarism in the planned agenda, but reserved the right to raise it again after discussing items one and two. The Foreign Ministers' Meeting appointed a special committee to discuss other issues raised in the Allied Control Council's report, as well as the suggestions of each delegation. Marshal Sokolovsky will represent the Soviet Union on the special committee, General Robertson will represent the United Kingdom, Nelson will represent the United States, and Erpen will represent France. The four foreign ministers instructed the committee to complete its work by April 2nd and submit a report on the 3rd.

　　德国问题讨论程序
    外长会议获得协议
    【新华社陕北一日电】据塔斯社莫斯科电：三月廿九日之四外长会议，由莫洛托夫主持，进一步讨论审查德境盟国管制委员会报告之建议程序。日前美国代表团提议，在进一步讨论此报告时，应限于下列三项问题：第一、德国之经济统一问题；第二、德境工业生产水平与偿付赔款问题；第三、德国临时政府之体制与性质问题。其余之问题，交由特别委员会审查。本日莫洛托夫建议称：美国提案中之一、二两项，可合并为一项，并补充一项新问题，即清除军国主义之残余。马歇尔同意将第一、二项问题合并，但对于清除德国军国主义残余问题怀疑是否有当。但声明美代表在原则上不反对将此问题列入议事程序。四国外长决定依照苏联代表团之建议，将第一项问题正式规定如下：视德国为经济之统一体，包括赔款及修订工业水平在内。苏联代表团不坚持将清除军国主义残余问题列入预定计划中，但保留在讨论一、二两项问题以后有重新提出讨论之权利。外长会议指定特别委员会讨论盟国管制委员会报告中所提出的其他问题，及各代表团之建议。苏联将由索科洛夫斯基元帅代表出席特别委员会，英国由罗伯逊将军出席，纳尔逊代表美国出席，艾尔蓬代表法国出席。四外长指定委员会在四月二日完成工作，三日提出报告。
