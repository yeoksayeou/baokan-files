　　【Report from the Northern Henan Front, April 15th】After our army liberated Pangcun and nearby strongholds occupied by Chiang Kai-shek's puppet Hu Quanlu, it immediately coordinated with the democratic government to distribute relief grain, clothing, farm tools, etc., to rescue the masses who had suffered more than ten years of devastation under Chiang Kai-shek's puppet regime. American-made airplanes and heavy artillery shells constantly flew over the heads of the masses receiving relief supplies, but under the resolute resistance of the People's Liberation Army, the emergency relief work was finally completed. The local masses suffered from enemy disasters, followed by Chiang Kai-shek's disasters. Chiang Kai-shek's puppet troops looted even the smallest items from the people, such as hoes, axes, and bedding. After hearing the news of the emergency relief, the masses within a forty-mile radius rushed to receive relief supplies. A blind man from Shanhoucun, who had been blind for a month, recovered his sight after hearing the news of the grain distribution. He happily said, "I saw nothing but death before, but now there is hope. I worked as a Mihan (hired laborer) for others for half my life, and as soon as I fell ill, they sent me home, not caring whether I lived or died. Humph! The Eighth Route Army is taking care of me now." An old lady from Magang and her child had just fled famine from Haizhou. They had nothing at home. On the 10th, she and her barefoot child went to Xiaotun to receive grain, and also received shoes, clothes, cotton, and tin buckets. On the way, the reporter met an old lady sitting by the roadside, annoyed and scolding, "Hu Quanlu has really ruined everyone. We are so poor that we can't even afford a needle. I wanted to sit down and rest, but the moment my butt touched the ground, my pocket broke. I can't sew it, so I have to watch the grain that the Eighth Route Army gave me, and I can't even carry it home." Eight families of puppet relatives in Daba Village, east of the Pinghan Railway, received relief grain in Pangcun. One of them said gratefully to the grain distribution personnel, "My child was captured into Hu's army. His father was forced to death because he couldn't pay Hu Quanlu's donation. Now I am left alone, a poor old woman. Don't laugh at me, but today when I heard about the grain distribution, I quickly borrowed a piece of clothing from my neighbor to wear before I dared to go out. As soon as the Eighth Route Army came, they gave us things. I really can't think of how to repay your kindness. It would be great if my child surrendered to your army. If he runs away, I will definitely find him and bring him back." Our democratic government distributed a total of about 200,000 jin of grain in Pangcun, so that the people suffering from disaster were rescued.

　　豫北我军赈济灾民
    在庞村发放粮食二十万斤
    【本报豫北前线十五日电】我军解放蒋伪扈全禄所盘踞之庞村及附近据点后，立即协同民主政府，发放救济粮、衣服、农具等，抢救惨遭蒋伪军十余年蹂躏的群众。美制飞机与重炮弹不时掠过领取救济物资的群众头上，但在解放军坚决阻击敌人下，终于完成急赈工作。该地群众遭受敌灾之后，又加上蒋灾。蒋伪军把老百姓的锄头、斧子、被服等零星物件都抢光了。四十里以内的群众得到急赈消息后，都抢先赶来领救济物资。山后村一个瞎了一个月的瞎子，听到放粮的消息也好了，他高兴的说：“眼看死路一条，现在可有望啦，给人家做了半辈子觅汉（即雇工），刚一病倒就赶我回家，不管死活，哼！八路军可来管我了”。马岗一位老太太和他孩子，才从海州逃荒回来，家里啥也没有，在十号这天他和光着脚的小孩到小屯领粮食，还领到鞋子、衣服、棉花、洋铁桶等。记者于途中遇见一个老太太坐在路旁又恼又骂：“扈全禄真把人都坑死啦，穷的连针也置不起一根，想坐下来歇歇，屁股没落地就把口袋破了。没法缝补，眼睁睁看着八路军给俺的粮食，都搬不到家。”平汉路东大八角村八家伪属在庞村领到救济粮，其中一个很感激地向发粮人员说：“俺孩孩被抓到扈队伍里，他爹因上不上扈全禄的捐，被逼死了，光剩下俺一个穷老婆，不怕你笑话，今天听到领粮，我赶快借邻家一件上身（衣服）才敢出门。八路军一来就给俺东西，真想不出拿啥报答恩情。俺孩孩要投降了咱队伍那才好哩，要是跑了，俺一定找他回来。”我民主政府在庞村发放粮食总数约二十万斤。使苦受灾害的人民，得到救济。
