　　Cixian County Forms Turn-Over Team
    To Go to Newly Recovered Areas
    To Help the Masses Overturn Their Situation
    [Our Newspaper] In order to develop the mass movement in the newly recovered areas and realize "land to the tiller," the Fifth Sub-district (Prefectural Committee) of the Taihang District decided to transfer a turn-over team from Cixian County to the newly recovered areas. After receiving the notice, the county immediately selected 100 village cadres and turn-over activists from various districts to begin intensive training in the county on the 3rd. Discussions were held on why they were going to help the peasants in the recovered areas overturn their situation, and experiences in overturning the situation were exchanged, resulting in extremely enthusiastic sentiments. The original plan was for three days of intensive training, but with the continuous victories reported from the recovered areas of Wu'an, Yuanyang, Fengqiu, and Qi County, everyone clamored to end the training early and set off sooner. With the sentiment that "peasants all over the world are one family" and "helping the masses in the new areas overturn their situation sooner," the next day Cixian County went to the sub-district (Prefectural Committee) to request immediate work assignments.

　　磁县组成翻身队
    到新收复区去
    帮助群众翻身
    【本报讯】为了开展新收复区的群众运动，实现耕者有其田，太行五分区（地委）决定从磁县调一翻身队到新收复区去。县里接通知后，即从各区抽调一百名村干部与翻身积极分子，于三号开始在县集训。对为何去帮助收复区农民翻身展开讨论，并交流翻身经验，情绪极热烈。原计划集训三天，但收复武、原武、封邱、淇县等胜利消息不断传来，大家纷纷要求早结束、早出发；在天下农民是一家、帮助新区群众早翻身的情绪下，次日即由磁县往分区（地委）要求立即分配工作。（常志高）
