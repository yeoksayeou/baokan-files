　　Mail to the Bureau Should Be Handled with Care
    To the Editor:
    On March 29th, a batch of books and newspapers was sent from the Wu'an Bureau to the Shahe Bureau. Upon inspection, it contained over ninety-six catties of books from Xingtai City destined for the Changzhi City Xinhua Bookstore, and it was returned.
    Why was it returned? The reason stated on several strips of white paper pasted on the books was very simple: "These books are too loose, return to origin," without specifying which bureau station was responsible for the return. When asked about it, postman Yang Yinxiang from Wu'an said with a tone of complaint: "What's so special about this? Anyway, 'the cadres talk, the postmen break their legs.' If they tell us to take it, how dare we not?" The key issue is not who returned it – of course, we should investigate responsibility – but that the return was not cautious enough. One of the nine bundles of books was indeed loose; the other eight bundles had no problem at all, but they "suffered disaster along with their neighbor" and were returned together. In this way, a lot of time and manpower are wasted. Even if all nine bundles were loose, I think we should carefully study and judge whether there is a problem. After judging and finding no problem, we should be responsible for resealing them. Even if there is a problem, we should not return them, let alone "return to origin." We should reseal them face-to-face with the departing postman from the upper bureau station and issue an inspection form to the upper bureau station, reporting to the Administration Bureau, and the upper bureau station will still be responsible if problems arise. Postman Yang's words fully expose the past lack of caution, or insufficient caution, of some of our bureau stations in handling problems. In the current situation of striving for an early victory in the patriotic self-defense war, and with everything for the support of the front lines, our postal work's only slogan, "Strive for every minute and every second," is even more important. All mail should be handled according to this principle. If the business staff believes there is no sufficient reason for return, or if it is unclaimed or unaddressed, they should immediately consult the bureau chief before proceeding with the handling, so as to be cautious and demonstrate credibility.

### 邮件到局应慎重处理

　　邮件到局应慎重处理编辑同志：
    三月二十九日由武安局发出一＠书报送到沙河局，检查了一下，内有邢台市发往长治市新华书店的九六十多共六十多斤，退回来了。
    为什么要退呢？贴在书上的几条白麻纸上声明的理由很简单：“此书太松退回原地”，并未注明是那个局站负责退回的。问起武安来的邮工杨银祥同志，他带埋怨口气说：“这有什么了不起，反正‘干部说说嘴，邮工跑断腿’，叫咱拿咱敢不拿？”问题的关键倒不在谁退的，当然我们应该追究责任——而是退的不够慎重，那九捆书有一捆确实是松了；其余的八捆毫没问题，可是它“跟着邻居遭灾殃”，也一同被打回来了，这样，时间与人力都浪费很大，即使九捆全都松了，我认为也应慎重研究，判断是否出了问题，经过判断，认为没有问题的，我们就应负责代封；即使有了问题也不该退，更不应该“退回原地”。我们应同上局站出发邮工当面代封，并发验单给上局站，报告管理局，出了问题仍由上局站负责。邮工杨同志的一番话，充分暴露了我们某些局站过去处理问题的不慎重，或不够慎重。在争取爱国自卫战争早日胜利，一切为了支援前线的今天，我们邮政工作的唯一口号：“争取一时一刻”，更显得重要，一切邮件都应根据这个原则处理，如业务员认为没有充分理由退回，存局候领或无着者，就应立即请示局长，再行处理，以资慎重而昭信誉。读者峻明
