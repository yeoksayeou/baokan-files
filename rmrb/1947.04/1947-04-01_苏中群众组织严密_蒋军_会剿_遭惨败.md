　　Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 28th: In a certain district of Rudong County in Central Jiangsu, the Chiang Kai-shek troops' "encirclement and suppression" was crushed through extensive and organized mass self-defense movements. "Running away from the bandits" (i.e., planned large-scale transfers) has become a mass action, so that the Chiang Kai-shek troops failed to capture a single young person in this "encirclement and suppression." Many gentry and landlords also participated in group escapes. They cleverly transformed and utilized the terrain. For example, a village installed dozens of removable bridges. When there was a situation, they took hidden paths to avoid the enemy. After the masses had left, they would remove the removable bridges, causing the enemy to run into walls everywhere. They were able to conduct frequent, extensive, and rigorous reconnaissance. Every time the enemy moved out, in addition to the militia conducting close reconnaissance and surveillance, many elderly people and children also automatically scouted for everyone. Masses who could not escape secretly investigated the enemy's situation and reported it to the militia. In order to prevent the Chiang Kai-shek troops from seizing any supplies, the masses reluctantly slaughtered all their fat pigs, and other supplies were buried. Protecting cadres, wounded soldiers, and public property has become a conscious and glorious responsibility of the masses. The struggle of women against rape has become a widespread movement. Women have bravely taken up scissors and other weapons to resolutely resist, making it difficult for the enemy to carry out atrocities.

　　苏中群众组织严密
    蒋军“会剿”遭惨败
    【新华社华中二十八日电】苏中如（皋）东县某区以广泛有组织的群众自卫运动，粉碎蒋军“会剿”，“跑反”（即有计划的大转移）已成为群众性的行动，使蒋军在这次“会剿”中没有捉到一个青年人，许多士绅地主亦纷纷参加小组跑反，他们巧妙的改造与运用地形，如某乡一个庄就安下几十条活桥，有情况时，走暗路避去，待群众走完，即将活桥抽掉，使敌人到处碰壁。他们能够经常广泛严密的侦察情况，当每次敌人出动时，除有民兵严密侦察监视外，许多老人小孩亦自动为大家侦察，不能跑反的群众，则暗查敌人情况报告民兵。为着不让蒋军抢得任何物资，群众忍痛将肥猪宰光，其他物资亦埋藏起来。掩护干部、伤员及公家物资，成为群众自觉的光荣责任。妇女的反强奸斗争，已成为一种广泛运动，妇女都勇敢的拿起了剪刀等武器，坚强反抗，使敌人暴行难逞。
