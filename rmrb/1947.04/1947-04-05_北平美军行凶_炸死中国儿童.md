　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 2nd. Beiping dispatch: Following the case of the American soldier shooting and killing elementary school student Wang Fengxi, another tragic incident of American military artillery shells killing Chinese children has occurred in Beiping. On the afternoon of the 31st, the U.S. military was conducting military exercises in the Western Hills of the Beiping suburbs when an artillery shell exploded among a group of playing children, instantly killing three and seriously injuring three. The dead were torn to pieces, and one of the injured, Song Qiyou, is in critical condition, a truly horrific scene. Afterwards, the American side has been trying to shirk responsibility, using "investigation" as a delaying tactic, while the Chiang Kai-shek Beiping authorities shamelessly assist in covering it up. This tragedy occurred just a few days before "April 4th" Children's Day, causing extreme indignation among all circles in Beiping.

　　北平美军行凶
    炸死中国儿童
    【新华社陕北二日电】北平讯：继美兵枪杀小学生王凤喜案后，平市又发生美军炮弹炸死中国儿童惨案。三十一日午后，美军于平郊西山举行军事演习，有一炮弹于游玩之儿童群中爆炸，当场即炸死三人，重伤三人。死者血肉横飞，伤者宋启有生命垂危，其状至惨。事后美方亟图推诿责任，以“调查”支吾一切，而蒋记平市当局则无耻助其掩护。此惨案适发生于“四四”儿童节之前数日，平市各界极为震愤。
