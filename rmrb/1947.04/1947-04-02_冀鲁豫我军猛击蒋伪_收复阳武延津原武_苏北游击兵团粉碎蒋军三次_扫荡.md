Xinhua News Agency, Jilu Yu Front, 30th: A unit of our Jilu Yu People's Liberation Army successively recovered the three county towns of Yangwu, Yanjin, and Yuanwu on the 28th and 29th. All of Chiang Kai-shek's puppet troops were annihilated. The results of the battle are being tallied.

Xinhua News Agency, East China, 1st: The Northern Jiangsu Guerrilla Corps, echoing the Huaibei Guerrilla Corps on the west bank of Hongze Lake, smashed three "sweeps" by Chiang's army in Huaian and Bao Ying counties east of Hongze Lake and west of the Grand Canal in mid-February. They once took advantage of the victory to cross the Sanhe River to the south, and for a time recovered Licheng Town in the Huainan Liberated Area. Staff Officer Cheng, a major general sent by the Chiang-controlled Xuzhou Pacification Headquarters' Huaiyin First Pacification Area Command to Huaian and Bao Ying to direct the "sweep," once declared that "the communist troops in Huaian and Bao Ying will be wiped out before the end of February." However, before the end of February, Cheng shamefully scurried back to Huaiyin during a night raid by the guerrilla corps. Currently, ten towns including Renhe, Shuanggou, Wanjji, Chenji, and Zhao Ji, as well as vast rural areas east of Hongze Lake, are free of the enemy. From the second half of January to the first half of February, six larger battles were fought, capturing over 150 Chiang Kai-shek's puppet troops alive, killing or wounding over 20; and seizing 150 long and short guns. The guerrillas also protected over 10,000 people to cut reed catkins at the bank of Hongze Lake, earning over 200,000 yuan per person, solving the spring famine caused by the autumn flood and Chiang Kai-shek's army's looting. Under the threat of the guerrilla corps, Chiang Kai-shek's district and township governments have disintegrated one after another, with some township chiefs voluntarily disbanding the "self-defense forces" and fleeing to the south of the Yangtze River. In the Huainan Liberated Area, west of Gaoyou Lake and opposite Huaian and Bao Ying across the Sanhe River, the Chiang Kai-shek regime in Maba, Tongcheng, Jingou, Licheng and other places is also tottering. Chiang Kai-shek's district and township chiefs have already sent away their families and are guarding day and night against attacks by the Huaian and Bao Ying Guerrilla Corps crossing the river.

　　冀鲁豫我军猛击蒋伪
    收复阳武延津原武
    苏北游击兵团粉碎蒋军三次“扫荡”
    【新华社冀鲁豫前线三十日电】我冀鲁豫人民解放军一部于二十八及二十九两日，先后收复阳武、延津、原武三县城，蒋伪军全部被歼，战果正清查中。
    【新华社华东一日电】与洪泽湖西岸淮北游击兵团互相呼应之苏北游击兵团，二月中在洪泽湖东、运河西之淮（安）宝（应）县粉碎蒋军三次“扫荡”。曾乘胜南渡三河，一度收复淮南解放区之黎城镇。蒋记徐州绥靖公署淮阴第一绥靖区司令部派往淮（安）宝（应）主持“扫荡”之少将参谋程某，曾扬言“在二月底以前消灭淮（安）宝（应）共军”。但程某已于二月底以前，某次游击兵团夜袭中狼狈窜回淮阴。现洪泽湖东仁和、双沟、万集、陈集、赵集等十个市镇及广大乡村均无敌人。一月下半月至二月上半月进行较大战斗六次，生俘蒋伪军一百五十余，毙伤二十余；缴长短枪一百五十枝。并掩护万余群众至洪泽湖畔割芦柴，每人收入达二十万元以上，解决了因去秋水灾及蒋军抢掠而酿成之春荒。蒋记区乡政权在游击兵团威胁下，纷纷瓦解，有些乡长自动解散“自卫队”，逃往江南。高邮湖西与淮（安）宝（应）隔三河对峙之淮南解放区马坝、铜城、金沟、黎城等地蒋政权亦岌岌自危。蒋记区乡长已将家属送走，日夜提防淮（安）宝（应）游击兵团渡河袭击。
