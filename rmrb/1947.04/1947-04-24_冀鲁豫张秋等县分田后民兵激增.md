    [Report from our newspaper in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region, 23rd] During the current land reform movement, the militia has greatly developed in Zhangqiu, Shouzhang, Fanxian, and Juancheng counties. In Zhangqiu's first district, after conducting education on protecting the land for the emancipated peasants, the militia increased from over fifty to two hundred and fifteen. In Shouzhang's second district, three villages had no militia organization in the past, but now have forty-eight militiamen; in the seventh district, many villagers are also requesting weapons. In Fanxian county, to protect the fruits of their distribution, the masses developed 167 militiamen in eight villages in one day and one night, and stipulated that if there are too many militiamen, they can take turns to avoid affecting production. After the Armed Forces Committee of Juancheng's fourth district overcame the masses' view of "fearing conscription," the militia's combat effectiveness greatly increased. Model squad leader Chen Anchang led ten militiamen to swear to the masses: "We vow not to leave our village, and we are willing to share life and death with the villagers." When the enemy occupied × village, only six li away from the village, the militia, in conjunction with the masses, stood guard outside the village, and the masses still held meetings to distribute land. The village militia headquarters became the pillar and command post for all the villagers, and the masses' confidence in the militia greatly increased.

    冀鲁豫张秋等县分田后民兵激增
    【本报冀鲁豫廿三日电】张秋、寿张、范县、鄄城等县在此次土地改革运动中，民兵大有发展。张秋一区在对翻身农民进行了保田教育后，民兵即由五十多个增加到二百十五个。寿张二区有三个村，过去没有民兵组织，现在已有四十八个民兵；七区也有好多村群众要求发武器。范县群众为保住分得果实，一天一夜的时间，八个村就发展民兵一六七人，并规定民兵多了可轮流换班，以免影响生产。鄄城四区武装会克服了群众的“怕拔兵”的观点后，民兵战斗力大增，模范班长陈安常乃率领十个民兵向群众宣誓：“誓死不离本村，愿与本村群众同生死共患难。”在敌人占领×村时，离该村只有六里地，民兵结合群众在村外警戒，群众照样开会分地，村民兵队部成为全村群众的支柱和指挥所，群众对民兵信心倍增。
