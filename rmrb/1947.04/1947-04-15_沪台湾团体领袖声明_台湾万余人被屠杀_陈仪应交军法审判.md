　　Shanghai Taiwan Groups Leaders' Statement
    Over Ten Thousand Taiwanese Massacred
    Chen Yi Should Be Handed Over for Court-Martial
    Chiang Orders Chen Yi to Resign in Attempt to Appease Public Anger
    American Newspapers Also Launch Fierce Criticism
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th] According to an Associated Press dispatch from Shanghai on the 11th: Several leaders of Taiwanese groups in Shanghai issued a written statement claiming that over ten thousand Taiwanese people were massacred, and over twenty thousand were seriously injured. These groups include the Taiwan Student Association of Nanjing and Shanghai, and the Taiwan Residents Association of Nanjing. They demand the immediate removal of Chen Yi and a military trial. The statement claims that as a result of Chen Yi's misrule, at least 400,000 Taiwanese people are unemployed. The statement also calls for an "immediate end to the reign of terror in Taiwan" and condemns Chen Yi for dispatching mainland thugs to assassinate Taiwanese group leaders. The statement points out that the reports by J.B. Powell, editor of the China Weekly Review, and the New York Herald Tribune reporter are truthful. The statement claims that this attitude is widely spread among Taiwanese people, namely that Taiwanese people believe "Chinese officials are much worse than the Japanese because during the rule of the Japanese warlords, Taiwanese people never saw such bloodshed and massacre!"
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 10th] American News Agency reports: The American press has fiercely criticized Chiang Kai-shek's instruction to Chen Yi to "resign" in order to ease the anger of the Taiwanese people and deceive Chinese and foreign figures. The San Francisco Chronicle commented on the 2nd: "If this (referring to Chen Yi's 'resignation') ends the whole affair, it is clearly not enough. The Chinese once used emotional humanitarian words to appeal and protest against the Japanese imperialist massacre. This time, people are criticizing the Chinese for carrying out a cruel massacre of Taiwanese people, just like the Japanese imperialists did. If it is true, and if it is indeed related to Chen Yi, he must be severely punished. His resignation, even if true, does not necessarily absolve him of his guilt. Resignation is just a gesture of officialdom, and this gesture is not suitable for this situation." Another newspaper commented: "Even if the bad situation in Taiwan is only half of what is described, this remedial measure (referring to Chen Yi's 'resignation') is not enough compared to those stupid and terrifying crimes. Taiwan should have a thorough purge."
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 12th] Grain prices in Taiwan continue to rise, and there are only prices but no market. Robberies of rice frequently occur in Taipei, and tragedies also happen repeatedly. On Taipei Bridge, a mother in her thirties, burned by hunger, tied her three children and herself together and threw themselves into the river. In Tianshen Town, Keelung City, a parturient woman had only twenty yuan left after giving birth, and gave it all to the midwife. The midwife refused to accept it, intending to use the money to buy rice for the parturient woman. The rice store owner refused to sell retail and even mocked her. The midwife, feeling ashamed and indignant, returned the money to the parturient woman and left. The parturient woman first strangled her baby to death and then hanged herself.

　　沪台湾团体领袖声明
    台湾万余人被屠杀
    陈仪应交军法审判
    蒋令陈仪辞职图息众怒
    美国报纸亦予猛烈抨击
    【新华社陕北十三日电】据美联社上海十一日电称：若干台湾团体领袖在上海发表书面声明称：台湾万余人被屠杀，两万余人负重伤。这些团体包括南京、上海的台湾学生协会与南京的台湾居民协会，他们要求立即撤回陈仪，并举行军事审判。声明称：由于陈仪恶政的结果，至少有四十万台人失业。声明并吁请“立即停止台湾的恐怖统治”，并谴责陈仪派遣大陆上的流氓刺杀台湾团体领袖。声明指出：密勒氏评论报主笔鲍威尔，与纽约先驱论坛报记者的报导是真实的。声明称：台湾人中间广泛散布这种态度，即台湾人认为“中国官吏比日本人坏得多，因为在日本军阀统治期间，台湾人从未见过这样的流血屠杀！”
    【新华社陕北十日电】美新闻处息：美国报界对外传蒋介石授意陈仪“辞职”，以缓和台湾人民愤怒与欺骗中外人士一事，予以猛烈抨击。旧金山纪事报二日论称：“假使这（指陈仪‘辞职’）就结束了整个事件，显然是很不够的。中国人曾用激动的人道话语呼吁抗议日本的帝国主义大屠杀，这次人们抨击中国人对台湾人施行残酷的屠杀，一如日本帝国主义作风；如确有其事，而且跟陈仪确实有关，他必须受到严正的惩处。他的辞职，即使属实，不见得可以卸掉他的过失。辞职不过是做官的一种姿态，这种姿态对此情此景是不适合的。”另一报纸评称：“即使台湾的恶劣情况，仅仅如所描述的一半的话，这种善后措施（指陈仪‘辞职’），比起那些愚蠢恐怖的罪恶行动来，还嫌不够。台湾应该有一次彻底的清除。”
    【新华社陕北十二日电】台湾粮价继续上涨，且有行无市。台北时常发生抢米案，惨案也屡次发生。台北桥上有三十余岁之母亲，在饥火焚烧下，将三个小孩与自己缚在一起投河自尽。基隆市天神町一产妇，分娩后仅剩二十元，悉数给助产士，助产士拒收，用该款为产妇独米，米店老板不肯零售，且加讽刺。助产士羞愤之下，将钱送回产妇离去。产妇先将婴孩扼死，自己上吊自尽。
