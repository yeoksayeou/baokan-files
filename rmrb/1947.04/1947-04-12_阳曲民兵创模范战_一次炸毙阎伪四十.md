　　Yangqu Militia Creates Model Battle
    One Bombing Kills Forty of the Yan Faction and Puppet Troops
    [Xinhua News Agency, Jin察冀 (Jinchaji) 10th dispatch] The Yangqu County militia in Jinzhong recently created a model landmine battle. On the 11th of last month, more than 80 members of the Yan puppet "Wutai, Dingxiang Agricultural and Soldier Integrated Vanguard Team" invaded, and as soon as they entered the area, they stepped on the county militia's so-called landmine formation. With several loud bangs, forty-two members of the Guan puppet forces were blown to pieces, and the rest fled in panic.
