　　Taihang Second Prefecture Finance Office Decides to Issue Loans Through Cooperatives

    [Our Newspaper Taihang News] In order to more effectively organize bank loans into mass production, the Finance Office of Taihang Second Prefecture has decided to closely integrate loans with the development of rural credit activities to maximize the effectiveness of loans. It has been decided that loan work will generally be carried out through cooperatives in the future. Except for some cooperatives in border counties that cannot be responsible due to their irregular business direction, the general ones will be handled by cooperatives. Bank cadres can directly engage in loan work in comprehensive production organization. Bank loans can be used as an actual force in cooperative credit activities to attract idle funds from the masses, gradually achieving organization, so that bank loans not only directly help mass production but also unite idle funds from the masses and support rural credit activities.

　　太行二专署财办决定
    依托合作社发贷款
    【本报太行讯】太行二专署财经办事处为使银行贷款更有效的组织到群众生产中去，特决定贷款与开展农村信用活动紧密结合，以高度发挥贷款效力。决定贷款工作，今后普遍经过合作社进行。除边沿县有部分合作社，因业务方向不够正规，不能负责外，一般的皆由合作社办理。银行干部可直接投入全面生产组织工作中去做贷款工作。银行贷款可做为合作社信用活动的一部实际力量，以银行贷款吸引群众游资，逐渐的达到组织起来，使银行贷款不仅直接帮助了群众生产，而又团结了群众游资，扶植了农村信用活动。（锦章）
