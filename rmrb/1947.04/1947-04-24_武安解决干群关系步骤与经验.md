    Wu'an's Steps and Experiences in Resolving Cadre-Masses Relations
    Wu Yun

    In the in-depth movement in Wu'an, a preliminary experience has been explored, that is, through adjusting the central link of cadre-masses relations, fully mobilizing poor peasants and farm laborers, transforming cadres, uniting advanced and backward elements, and closely linking the Party with the masses. On the basis of the unity and consciousness of the peasants, a review movement is launched to completely eliminate feudalism and achieve supplementary leveling and equalization. The method is to gather a large number of honest peasants, cadres, and activists, training both advanced and backward elements simultaneously, unify the mobilization, and create a large-scale movement of unity, consciousness, and squeezing out feudalism. The steps and main experiences in resolving cadre-masses relations are introduced as follows:

    Mobilization During Preparation

    A. How to Mobilize Honest Peasants

    I. Affirm the reasonable demands of the peasants, enlighten the peasants' ideological consciousness, and fully mobilize honest peasants.

    A common problem in the in-depth movement is that honest peasants have not thoroughly turned over, most have only turned over halfway, and a few have not even turned over halfway. For example, Pang Mangui, a farm laborer in Dongtongle, is still penniless without a house or land. Wang Qi, a poor peasant in Datun, has nothing but four mu of bad land and wears ragged clothes. Even in Nan Fengchang, an advanced village that had been leveled, it was discovered that the leveling was uneven. Wang Shuyi, an outsider, was allocated 19 mu of land for his family of four, all of which were the furthest land located four li away, without housing or livestock (the leveling standard in this village was 5.5 mu of irrigated and dry land per person, two rooms, and one livestock per three families). Because the basic demands of peasants to thoroughly turn over have not been met, peasants continue to demand to thoroughly struggle against landlords and demand a reasonable and equal distribution of all struggle fruits. The masses expressed dissatisfaction with the cadres' complacency, that they had turned over themselves but did not care about their poor brothers, that their struggle was not active, and even that they shielded landlords. Regarding past struggles, it was recognized that the distribution of fruits was not reasonable, such as whoever had a problem could settle accounts, whoever was active got more, those in the peasant association got to divide, distribution was based on the size of the position, regardless of class background distribution was according to the number of people, and fruits had to be bought with money.... One peasant in Datun said, "I used to be afraid of the sky changing and didn't dare to ask for anything. Now I dare to ask, but there is nothing left. Should we be poor because we are backward?" An old man in Nan Fengchang said, "The street leader of our village, Jia Hui, is a rich peasant, and he also divided the fruits like the poor. I only got 40 jin of grain, but he got more than 400 jin for his family of ten. Is this leveling a pit or adding to a pile?" In addition, in the past, a few cadres made decisions on the distribution of fruits, the masses had no say, and the cadres also used methods such as "rewards," "private distribution," "extracting funds," and other means to embezzle the fruits, so the distribution of fruits was generally unfair. In some places, the phenomenon of cadres getting more fruits is still very serious, and the masses are very dissatisfied. For example, Guo Changqing, the director of the peasant association in Xi Ma Xiang, had 11 livestock, occupied five courtyards, two mills, and 50 mu of good land for his family of three. The people secretly called him "Sizi Leren" (Wu'an's puppet police captain). In Datun, 19 livestock were struggled out, the cooperative wanted 12, and the seven main cadres each took one. The masses said, "After struggling for more than a year, they eat meat and we smell the aroma." "In a word, the capable can turn over, but the poor still can't turn over."

    Honest peasants want to speak, wanting to give cadres an opinion, which is based on these two main demands. But in the beginning, honest peasants had many concerns, and ideological blindness still existed: (1) They were afraid that cadres would hold grudges, retaliate, act as spies, and not give them any fruits in the future. (2) They were afraid that the higher-ups would not take their side, believing that officials protect each other, that district cadres always sided with village cadres, and that even if they raised an issue, it would be in vain, and they would just admit their mistakes and it would be fine; some people also thought that the fruits had already been distributed, and that raising the issue wouldn't change anything. (3) They thought that things were much better now than before, and that this was considered turning over. They figured that the fruits would never be distributed equally, and that turning over wouldn't make everyone the same. They believed that as long as people were content, they wouldn't say anything. (4) They believed that raising an opinion was like struggling against someone, and that it would be unconscionable to give cadres benefits and then raise an opinion against them. (5) They believed that the fruits were struggled out by others, and that they could only ask for them if others told them to, and that they couldn't ask for them if others didn't tell them to. (6) They believed that cadres contributed a lot of effort and should get more, that they had the ability and should turn over, and that they couldn't blame others for not turning over, but blame themselves for being backward and incompetent.

    Therefore, the leadership must first affirm the reasonable demands of the masses (this is to support them and take their side). For example, the Fourth District proposed the slogans: "Feudalism will not be eliminated, the struggle will not stop." "If the pits are not filled, the distribution will not be completed" (meaning that the distribution of fruits is not considered final, and can still be adjusted), which showed the attitude and determination of the leadership; and helped the masses solve specific problems such as how to thoroughly struggle, thoroughly turn over, and what is reasonable and equal distribution. This greatly encouraged the masses, putting them in a more reasonable and legitimate position. Secondly, it used the method of comparing suffering and comparing turning over to enlighten the peasants' sense of fruit. In the beginning, the masses in Bei Fengchang discussed whose fruits were. Some said, "The cadres gave them," "Chairman Mao gave them," but then they discussed "Where did the cadres come from?" They said they "struggled against the landlords," and then they discussed "Where did the landlords come from?" "They exploited the poor," so they clarified that the fruits were their own blood and sweat, and that the peasants were the true masters of the land. Xu Quanming, a farm laborer in Nan Fengchang, compared suffering and turning over, saying: "Both Xiaogui (the village chief) and I used to be long-term laborers for the landlords. We only stopped when the Eighth Route Army came. We suffered the same. Now he is a cadre, living in a good courtyard, raising three livestock, and planting more than 30 mu of good land. I am still about the same as before, without anything I want, just a few mu of useless land." This gradually made them realize that the poor suffered the same in the past, and should turn over the same today, that the fruits belonged to everyone, and that equal distribution was a reasonable and legitimate demand, that raising an opinion was not a struggle, but to "fill in the pits and make up the deficiencies, and live a good life together." It also broke the honest peasants' notions of conscience, fate, contentment, and unwillingness to compete with others in the matter of fruit distribution.

    II. Distinguish right from wrong, separate good from bad, and draw a clear line ideologically.

    After the masses raise opinions separately, they should be enlightened to the class unity and consciousness of the peasants, so that the honest peasants can distinguish ideologically from the landlords, special agents, and hooligans who are being used, and also distinguish from individual peasants who are taking private revenge, and the sectarianism among some peasants. For example, the masses in the Fourth District realized from the discussion that "We raise opinions to love and protect the cadres, and the landlords and special agents raise opinions to try to defeat the cadres; we raise opinions to speak for the poor, and the hooligans raise opinions because they are used by bad elements, to speak for the landlords; we raise opinions to turn over everyone and unite the cadres and masses, and some people raise opinions only to seek private revenge, engage in sectarianism, and start struggles among their own people." After the masses clarified their position and drew a clear line, the landlords and special agents were exposed, the hooligans and bad elements were isolated, and the few people who sought private revenge and engaged in sectarianism also realized their mistakes. For example, in Xi Tongle, the hooligan and puppet soldier Guo Jintai and two others seized the dissatisfaction of the masses, mobilized the masses to propose changing all the village cadres, struggling against the village chief and political director, and threatened and deceived honest peasants to elect them as cadres. After the masses realized this, they exposed all their activities. The family members of the special agents in Bei Fengchang also participated in the meeting to raise opinions. The masses simply drove them out and did not allow them to raise opinions, saying that they wanted to avenge the dead special agents. The contradiction between the east and west heads of Dong Tongle was also criticized, and both sides reviewed themselves and strengthened unity. In this way, recognizing the bad guys also protected the good guys, and canceling the fake opinions also approved the opinions of the honest peasants, and both the masses and the cadres were greatly relieved.

    B. How to Improve Cadre Consciousness

    I. Cadres in the new district have not had their faces washed by the masses, and they are very arrogant with a strong sense of self-merit. Therefore, when the masses raised a lot of opinions, the cadres were very shocked, and their arrogance turned into anger, and their sense of self-merit turned into various negative resistance emotions. The main ideas of the cadres are: (1) They have worked hard for the masses, and in the end they have become the object of struggle. After a year of work, everything has become a shortcoming, and there is no merit at all. (2) Being a village cadre is afraid on both ends and suffers from all sides. If the work is not done well, they will be angry with the higher-ups. If the method is not good, they will be angry with the masses. If they miss work, they cannot produce and will be angry with their wives at home. (3) "There is no guarantee for being a cadre." "Whoever is active offends the most people, and whoever collapses the fastest." (4) "When the wall falls, everyone pushes it. Now everything is the fault of the village cadres. The masses only find fault with the cadres, and the higher-ups only listen to the backward." "The masses turn their faces ruthlessly, and the higher-ups' rewards and punishments are unclear." "The masses raise opinions randomly, and the higher-ups press down and wash their faces." "The credit is yours, and the mistakes are the village cadres'."

    To sum up the above ideas, they are issues such as merit, difficulties, future, and mistakes. The leadership should not be afraid of the cadres complaining, and should encourage the village cadres to boldly expose their ideas and raise opinions to the leadership as much as possible. The county and district cadres should set an example, sincerely accept, and humbly review all their shortcomings. And it is necessary to affirm that these cadres really worked hard first and enjoyed later, and that their achievements are immortal. But it is necessary to further guide the cadres to recognize: How did you gain merit? How should you behave with merit? This not only boosted the morale of the cadres, but also improved their sense of self-merit. Everyone clarified that the cadres have great merits, but without the masses there would be no merit, so with merit one cannot forget the masses, and should better serve the masses, eliminate shortcomings, put down burdens, and make more contributions to the people. Secondly, the leadership must acknowledge the difficulties of the cadres and give deep sympathy. Then, starting from the difficulties of the cadres, improve the cadres' confidence and understanding. Although it is so difficult, we have still completed the task. This proves that our village cadres are still very good. Now our work has shortcomings, not only are the higher-ups helping to correct them, but also the masses are giving us opinions, which is even more reliable. In the future, our work will be even more effective. Regarding the future of the cadres, the leadership should review the past cadre policies in connection with this district. For example, the Eighth District specifically reviewed the errors in handling the Xu Shuizi issue, and explained the correct cadre policy in detail. The Fourth District reviewed that in the past, there was a lack of education for cadres, and sometimes only the morale of the cadres was attacked, which resulted in some cadres becoming more detached from the masses. For example, Guo Xifang in Bei Fengchang had a very bad style, and three reviews did not correct him, and finally he was opposed by the whole village. After the leadership made such a review, the cadres were greatly moved. On the one hand, they believed in the determination of the higher-ups to love the cadres and correct the deviations, and on the other hand, they also realized that "It is wrong for the higher-ups to struggle against the cadres, and it is their own fault for being detached from the masses." And from reviewing the lessons of history, they realized that "If the cadres are detached from the masses, and the masses dare not raise opinions, the future will be very dangerous." "If the cadres wash their faces and wipe them black frequently, and the masses give them opinions, the future will be guaranteed." "The guarantee of the higher-ups is not as good as the guarantee of the masses, and the guarantee of the masses is not as good as self-guarantee," which improved the cadres' future consciousness. Finally, the leadership should also help the cadres analyze various mistakes, share the responsibility for the mistakes, and not blame all the mistakes on the village cadres. Only by distinguishing responsibilities can the cadres clarify their responsibilities, and only by sharing the mistakes can they avoid shirking responsibility. The Fourth District proposed that "Merit is the strength of everyone, and everyone should share the responsibility for mistakes." "If the upper beam is not straight, the lower beam will be crooked. If the village cadres have shortcomings, the district cadres are also responsible." In addition to sharing and assuming responsibility for the mistakes, the leadership also helps the cadres recognize which shortcomings are caused by the influence of the landlords and the old society, and which shortcomings are caused by the development of policies and the work process (such as the fruit distribution issue), pointing out that merit is permanent and shortcomings are temporary, and that shortcomings cannot cover up merit; and that even if the face is black, the skin is still white. This encourages the cadres to have the courage to criticize themselves, feeling that if it is our merit, we will be praised, and if it is our mistake, we should dare to take responsibility! If the higher-ups make mistakes, they will accept them, and if we make mistakes, we should accept them. What else is there to say? In short, the thinking for cadres is not passively acknowledging but actively improving, turning passivity into activity, and turning passivity into initiative.

    武安解决干群关系步骤与经验
    吴云
    武安在深入运动中，初步摸索到一个经验，即通过调整干群关系这一中心环节，充分发动贫雇，改造干部，团结先进和落后，密切党与群众关系，并在农民团结自觉的基础上，开展复查运动，彻底消灭封建实现补平补齐。方法则是大量集中老实农民干部积极分子，落后层和积极层同时训练，统一发动，造成大规模的团结自觉团结挤封建的运动。解决干群关系的步骤和主要经验介绍如下：
    酝酿中发动
    甲、怎样发动老实农民
    一、肯定农民的合理要求，启发农民的思想自觉，充分发动老实农民。
    深入运动中普遍存在的问题是老实农民没有翻透身，多数只翻了半个身，少数半个身也没翻好，例如东同乐雇工庞满贵至今无房无地，还是一贫如洗。大屯贫农王启的除了四亩坏地以外，啥也没有，穿的一身破衣裳。经过填平的先进村南冯昌，也发现了填的不平，外来户王树义，四口人分到十九亩都是四里地以外的最远地，没有房屋和牲口（该村填平标准是每人水旱地五亩半，二间房，三家一个牲口）。由于农民彻底翻身的基本要求没有得到满足，因此扩大农民依然要求继续斗透地主，并要求一切斗争果实合理平均分配。群众对于干部的自满情绪，自己翻了身不管穷弟兄，斗争不积极，甚至包庇地主的现象，表示不满。对于过去的斗争，谁有问题谁能算帐，谁积极谁多分，在农会的才能分，按职务大小分等，不论成分按人口平均分配，果实还要付钱买………等分配果实的办法，已觉悟到不合理。大屯一个农民说：“我以前怕变天不敢要东西，现在敢要，但东西没有了，俺落后就该俺穷？”南冯昌一个老汉说：“俺村街长贾惠是个富农，也和穷人一样分果实，俺一口只分到四十斤粮食，他十口人就分到四百多斤粮食，这是叫填圪道还是添圪堆。”加上过去分果实，少数干部作主，群众说不上话，干部又用“提奖”、“私分”、“抽经费”及其他办法贪污果实，所以果实分配普遍不公。有些地方，干部多得果实的现象还很严重，群众非常不满。例如西马项农会主任郭常青，三口人，在运动中得过十一头牲口，占着五座院，二个碾磨，五十亩好地，老百姓背后叫他“四子乐然”（武安伪警备队长）。大屯斗争出十九头牲口，合作社要了十二头，七个主要干部一家要了一个，群众说：“斗争一年多，人家吃肉咱闻腥。”“一句话说完，能人能翻身，穷人还是翻不了身。”
    老实农民要求说话，想给干部提个意见，就是基于这两个主要要求出发的。但在开始的时候，老实农民的顾虑很多，思想上的盲目性依然存在：（一）害怕干部记仇、报复、当特务办，以后不给分果实。（二）害怕上级不给作主，认为官官相佑，区干部总是向村干部，提也是白搭，认认错就没事了；还有人认为果实已经分完，提不提顶个啥。（三）认为现在比从前强多了，这就算翻了身了，到啥时候果实也分不平，翻身也不能翻成一样，人只要知足就啥也不说了。（四）认为提意见就是斗争，干部给了咱好处咱再提干部意见，似乎对不住人家，昧了良心。（五）认为果实是人家斗出来的，人家叫咱要咱才能要，人家不叫咱要还不能要。（六）认为干部出力大，人家就应该多分，人家本事大，就该人家翻身，咱们不能翻身怨咱落后，怨咱没本事。
    因此领导上首先必须肯定群众的合理要求（这就是撑腰作主）。如四区提出：“封建不消灭，斗争不停止”。“圪道不填平，分配不到底”（即果实分配不算到底，还可以动）的口号，表明了领导的态度和决心；并帮助群众解决了怎样才算斗透、翻透、啥是合理平均分配等具体问题，这样就大大鼓舞了群众，使群众处于更有理更合法的地位；其次即用比痛苦比翻身的方法，启发农民的果实自觉。北冯昌群众开始讨论果实是谁的，有人说：“是干部给的”，“是毛主席给的”，但又讨论“干部是那里来的”？说是“斗争老财来的”，又讨论“老财从那里来的”？“是剥削穷人的”，这样才明确了果实是自己的血汗，农民是土地真正的主人。南冯昌雇工徐全明比痛苦比翻身说：“我和小黑的（村长）早先都是给老财住长工的，八路军过来才一齐不住了，受的是一样罪；现在人家当了干部，住的一座好院，喂的三头牲口，种的三十多亩好地，咱还是给过去差不多，要啥没啥，就是多了几亩瞎巴地。”这样就逐渐认识到穷人过去同样受痛苦，今天应该同样得到翻身，果实是大家的，平均分配乃是合理正当的要求，提意见不是斗争，而是为了“填平和补齐，同过好光景”。并打破了老实农民在果实分配问题上的良心、命运观念，安分守己，不与人争，满足于贫穷的思想。
    二、辨清是非，分别好坏，从思想上划清界线。
    群众提意见是分提，以后即应启发农民的阶级团结自觉，使老实农民从思想上和地主特务及被利用的流氓坏分子分清界线，和个别农民报私仇，部分农民间宗派，也区别开来看。如四区群众从讨论中认识到“咱提意见是爱护干部，地主特务提意见是想打垮干部；咱提意见是替穷人说话，流氓提意见是受了坏分子利用，是替地主老财说话；咱提意见是为大家翻身、干群团结，有些人提意见光想报私仇、闹宗派，给自己人起斗争”。群众明确立场划清界线以后，地主特务被蹬展了，流氓坏分子被孤立了，报私仇闹宗派的少数人也觉悟了。例如西同乐流氓伪军郭金太等三人抓住群众不满情绪，活动群众提出改换所有村干部，斗争村长、政治主任，并威胁欺骗老实农民选他们当干部，群众觉悟后，就把他们的活动全部揭露出来。北冯昌特务家属也参加开会提意见，群众干脆把他赶出，不许他提意见，说他想替死了的特务报仇。东同乐东西头矛盾，大家也提出批评，双方都检讨了自己，加强了团结。这样认清了坏人也是保护了好人，取消了假意见也就批准了老实农民意见，群众和干部都大大放了心。
    乙、怎样提高干部自觉
    一、新区干部没有经群众洗过脸，骄气很大，居功思想浓厚。所以当群众大量提出意见时，干部震动很厉害，骄气变为怒气，居功思想变成各种消极抵抗情绪。干部主要思想认为：（一）辛辛苦苦为了群众，最后落个斗争对象。干了一年工作，现在都成了缺点，就没有半点功劳。（二）当村干部两头害怕，三面受气，工作做不好受上级气，方式不好受群众的气，误了工不能生产受家里老婆的气。（三）“当干部没保证”，“谁积极得罪的人多，谁垮台快”。（四）“墙倒众人推，现在啥也是村干部的不对，群众光找干部的岔，上级光听落后的话”，“群众反脸无情，上级赏罚不明”，“群众乱提意见，上级按住洗脸”，“有功劳是你们的，有错误是村干部的”。
    上述思想总结起来，就是功劳、困难、前途、错误等问题。领导上应该不怕干部发牢骚，并且应该鼓励村干部大胆暴露思想，尽量对领导提出意见。县区干部对于自己的一切缺点，应以身作则，诚恳接受，虚心检讨。并要确实肯定这些干部真是辛苦在前享福在后，成绩是不朽的。但必须进一步引导干部认识：自己是怎样有了功劳的？有了功劳应该怎样？这样就不仅鼓舞了干部情绪，而且提高了干部的功劳自觉。使大家明确了：干部是有很大功劳的，但是要没有群众就不可能有功劳，因此有功劳就更不能忘了群众，应该更好的为群众服务，去掉缺点放下包袱为人民更加立功。其次领导上必须承认干部的困难，并给予深刻的同情。然后从干部的困难出发，提高干部的信心和认识。虽然这样困难，咱们同样完成了任务，这证明咱们村干部还是很好的，现在咱们工作有缺点，不但有上级帮助纠正，还有群众给咱提意见，这就越发有靠头了，以后工作就更有办法了。对于干部的前途问题，领导上应该联系本区检讨过去的干部政策。如八区具体检讨了处理许水子问题的错误，并详细解释了正确的干部政策。四区则检讨过去对干部缺乏教育，有时光打击了干部情绪，结果反而使某些干部更加脱离群众。如北冯昌郭西方作风很坏，三次检讨三次没有纠正，最后遭到全村反对。领导上这样检讨以后，干部大为感动，一方面相信了上级爱护干部和纠正偏向的决心，另方面也认识到“斗争了干部是上级的不对，脱离群众是自己的错误”。并从检讨历史的教训中，认识到“干部脱离群众，群众有意见不敢提，前途就很危险”；“干部经常洗脸擦黑，有群众给自己提意见，前途就有了保证”；“上级保证不如群众保证，群众保证不如自己保证”，提高了干部的前途自觉。最后，领导上还应该帮助干部分析各种错误，分担错误责任，不能把错误一律归咎于村干部，只有分清责任，才能使干部明确责任，分担错误，才不致推诿错误。四区提出“有功劳是大家力量、有错误应大家分当”，“上梁不正下梁歪，村干部有缺点区干部也有责任”。领导上除分担，应负错误责任之外，还帮助干部认识有那些缺点是由于地主旧社会的影响产生的；有的缺点是由于政策的发展和工作过程中产生的（如果实分配问题），指出功劳是永久的，缺点是一时的，缺点盖不住功劳；脸是黑的皮还是白的，这样就鼓励了干部自我批评的勇气，觉得是咱功劳给咱表扬，是咱错误还不敢担当！上级的错误上级接受，咱的错误就该咱接受，这还有啥说。总之，对于干部的思想，不是消极的承认而是积极的提高，是变消极为积极，变被动为主动。
