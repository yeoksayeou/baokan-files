The original telegram is as follows:

　　To Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, Deputy Commander-in-Chief Peng, Chairman Lin, Political Commissar Xi, and all commanders and soldiers on the Western Front:

　　The traitor Chiang Kai-shek, employing his most loyal lackey, Hu Zongnan, committed all his forces to invade Yan'an, the sacred site of Chinese democracy. All officers and soldiers of our column are filled with indignation. Upon hearing that our Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao have safely relocated, we are deeply relieved. We hereby send a telegram to our great and wise leader, Comrade Mao Zedong, to express our cordial and warm greetings and wish him good health! We express our infinite admiration for the heroes of the Western Front who are gloriously defending the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao!

　　Now, all the officers and soldiers of our column vow to make contributions to the people, to establish an immortal cause for defending our Party Central Committee, Chairman Mao, and the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region. Everyone has now formulated plans to kill the enemy, is sharpening their swords and preparing their horses, waiting in battle readiness. Under the banner of Mao Zedong, we will advance bravely, vowing to wipe out the Chiang-Hu bandit troops, recover all lost territory, and fight to end Chiang's civil war and dictatorial rule!

　　Chen Geng, Xie Fuzhi, Han Jun, Liu Youguang, Liu Zhong, Zhou Xihan, Li Chengfang, Hu Ronggui, Liu Feng, Chen Kang, Lei Rongtian, Li Xifu, Liu Jin＠, and Li Yao, leading all commanders and soldiers, March 26th.
