　　Cadres and Masses Unite in Sincere Self-Criticism
    Acknowledging Shortcomings While Recognizing Merits
    Lin County's Fourth and Sixth Districts Launch Unity Campaign
    [Our Dispatch] Following the mass rally of over ten thousand peasants in Lin County's fourth and sixth districts in early February, held in Linqi Town for a general outpouring of grievances and a grand parade, the entire district then convened impoverished peasant and farm laborer conferences at base points and in villages. The goal was to thoroughly eliminate feudalism through education and widely mobilize the "cutting of tails" (confessing errors) and "filling of potholes" (rectifying mistakes). To achieve peasant unity and completely eradicate feudalism, a cadre-mass unity campaign was first launched. At the Guan Village base point's impoverished peasant conference, while the masses denounced landlords, they also raised opinions about cadres with shortcomings. The cadres gathered every night for self-criticism, and their work style has greatly changed. The Zhao Guan Village head, after criticizing his work style, also confessed to the masses that he had embezzled a set of cotton clothes, and offered to take them off. Seeing his determination to reform, the masses supported him keeping the clothes, urging him to continue leading well. The village militia captain voluntarily returned two *shi* of grain, a vat, and a woolen blanket that he had embezzled to the masses. The Farmers' Association chairman criticized his own passive work and lack of resolute struggle against landlords after the turn-over. When the masses evaluated the cadres, some proposed replacing them, but the majority unanimously advocated "letting the cadres continue to work first." This showed that the masses still cared for the cadres in their hearts. The cadres, in turn, vowed to the masses to change their work style and resolutely lead the masses to a thorough turn-over. The Nianshang village head confessed: "After I was liberated, I had food to eat and forgot that everyone was starving." He was determined to lead everyone to a complete turn-over and wanted to return the land he had gained. The masses said: "You don't need to return the fruits, as long as you resolutely lead everyone." After the Zhongshi Chen village head confessed to embezzling twelve *shi* of grain, the masses automatically corrected other unsubstantiated opinions raised by individuals. The relationship between cadres and the masses was united as never before, and in the end, the cadres were only asked to return one-third (four *shi*). Cadres in other villages, such as Ma Guan, West Jiang, Ze Xia, Niu Jia Gang, Front Shi Chen, and Huang Di, all underwent "face-washing and black-wiping" (self-criticism), and their mood changed from depression to activity, breaking the past fear of the masses "struggling" against them. West Jiang cadres have accepted the opinions of the masses, stopped all kinds of waste, and are actively organizing village finances. Most villages have turned to a thorough reckoning and struggle against landlords.

    The smooth development of this movement is due to their grasp of several key points. First, before the movement, the district cadres first set an example by calling on village cadres to offer opinions to district cadres at a village cadre conference, which lasted for two days and two nights. Then, the district cadres made self-criticisms, returned the fruits they had cheaply bought, and admitted past mistakes such as inadequate care for the difficulties of village cadres and arbitrary criticism, which dispelled the village cadres' mistaken idea that "face-washing" would lead to a loss of leadership prestige. Second, district cadres should support the masses when mobilizing them; after the opinions are fully expressed, they should guide the masses to discuss in detail and distinguish right from wrong. If it is a cadre's mistake, then the cadre should examine and correct it; if it is not a cadre's mistake, then a necessary explanation should be given. Otherwise, the landlords will take the opportunity to frame them, and the cadres will not be convinced. Third, after the problem is resolved, it is necessary to guide the masses to evaluate the cadres from a historical perspective and appropriately assess their merits and demerits. Encourage cadres to voluntarily swear an oath to the masses and call on the masses to supervise the cadres based on their oaths. (Zi An)

　　干群一心诚恳检讨
    说缺点还要评功劳
    林县四六区开展干群团结运动
    【本报讯】林县四、六区于二月初在临淇镇召开万余农民大会进行总诉苦、大游行之后，紧接着全区分基点、分村召开贫雇农大会，进行彻底消灭封建的教育，广泛动员割尾巴、填圪洞。为做到农民团结，彻底消灭封建，首先掀起一个干群团结运动。官村基点贫雇大会上，群众一面控诉地主，一面也向有错误的干部提出意见，干部每夜集会自我检讨，作风已有很大转变。赵官村村长检讨了作风，又向群众坦白自己贪污了一套棉衣，要给群众脱下。群众见他决心改过，又把棉衣拥护了他，叫他继续好好领导。该村民兵队长把贪污的两石粮、一个缸与一条毛毡自动退给群众。农会主席检讨了自己翻身后工作消极、斗争地主不坚决等错误。群众鉴定干部时，有人提出要撤换干部，大部群众一致主张“先让干部继续干”。这表现出群众对干部内心还是十分爱护的。干部则向群众宣誓转变作风，坚决领导群众彻底翻身。碾上村长检讨说：“我翻了身，有了吃，忘了大家受饿。”他决心领导大家翻透身，并要退出多得房地。群众说：“果实不用退，只要你坚决领导大家。”中石陈村长把贪污十二石粮食的事实坦白后，群众自动把个别人提的其他不确实意见做了纠正，干群关系空前团结，最后只让干部退出三分之一（四石）。其他马官村、西蒋、泽下、牛家岗、前石陈、黄底等十五村干部都进行了洗脸擦黑，情绪由消沉转趋活跃，打破了过去怕群众“斗争”自己的顾虑。西蒋干部已接受群众意见，停止了各种浪费，正积极整理村财政。大部村庄，则已转向对地主的彻底清算斗争。
    这一运动得以顺利开展，是由于他们掌握了几个关键。第一、运动之前，先由区干部做模范，在村干部大会上号召村干给区干提意见，整提了两天两夜；然后区干自我检讨，把自己贱买的果实退出，承认了过去对村干困难照顾不周，随意批评等错误，使村干打破了怕洗脸会丧失领导威信的错误想法。第二、区干部在动员群众时要给群众撑腰；在意见彻底提出后，又要引导群众详细讨论，分别是非曲直。是干部错误，则由干部检讨改正，不是干部错误，则加以必要解释。否则会被地主钻空栽赃，干部不会服气。第三、问题解决后，要引导群众从历史上给干部做鉴定，适当评定干部功过。要鼓励干部自动向群众宣誓，号召群众根据干部誓言去监督干部。（自安）
