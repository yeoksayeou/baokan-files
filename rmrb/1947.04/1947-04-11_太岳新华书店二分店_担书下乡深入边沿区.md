　　Taiyue Xinhua Bookstore Branch No. 2
    Carries Books to the Countryside, Penetrating Border Areas
    [This newspaper's Taiyue dispatch, 7th] Comrades of the Xinhua Bookstore Branch No. 2, led by Manager Zhang Gengxin, personally carried books into the countryside and border areas, providing convenience for readers and promoting the bookstore's business. After the Chiang Kai-shek troops occupied Yicheng and Fushan in September of last year, the branch moved to the rear of Fushan. Due to inconvenient transportation and scattered villages, Manager Zhang Gengxin came up with the idea of "carrying books to the countryside." Initially, the sales staff were not enthusiastic, so Comrade Gengxin took the lead in carrying a load of books to the countryside for a trial run in November. He spent four days traveling within Fushan and Yicheng, delivering books directly to readers. Everyone was extremely satisfied with the bookstore's spirit of "serving the readers," and the comrades of the Yicheng and Fushan District Committee enthusiastically praised this hard-working style. Subsequently, they divided the area into four central zones: Zhaigeda, Zhengjiaqiao, Hancun, and Wangbi, with four salespeople each carrying books to sell. They attended every market, every fair, visited village cadres, went to primary schools, and penetrated the masses to promote sales, also penetrating into army organs to promote sales. New books could quickly meet the readers. They could not carry all the books, but if buyers wanted to buy a certain book, even if it was only three or five copies, they would send someone to deliver it. Therefore, they had a very high reputation among readers, and their business also developed greatly. Later, they felt that the masses in the border areas were more in need of reading books about the current situation. Therefore, they further carried "Chiang Kai-shek's Inevitable Defeat" and other works on the current situation, as well as new primary school textbooks, and penetrated the village primary schools on the Jiangyi Highway. Cadres and the masses here had always wanted to read books but could not buy them. Now, the book peddler suddenly appeared at the door, causing them great surprise and excitement, so each time they could sell books worth twenty or thirty thousand yuan. Every time Comrade Gengxin left a village, the primary school teachers would always earnestly urge him: "Come again next time." (He Wei)

　　太岳新华书店二分店
    担书下乡深入边沿区
    【本报太岳七日电】新华书店二分店同志，在经理张更新同志带头下，亲自挑书深入农村与边沿地区，使读者获得方便，书店营业获得进展。去年九月蒋军侵占翼城、浮山后，该店转移在浮山后方。因交通不便，村庄分散，经理张更新同志即想出“挑书下乡”的办法。开始营业员们思想打不通，更新同志即首先于十一月挑了一担书下乡试做。他在浮山、翼城境内跑了四天，把书直接送到读者手里。大家对书店这种“为读者服务”的精神极为满意，二地委机关同志更热烈赞扬这种艰苦作风。接着他们划分了四个中心区：寨圪瘩、郑家桥、韩村、王壁分由四个营业员担书去卖。逢集赶集，逢会赶会，访村干部，串小学校，深入群众中去推销，也深入到军队机关中去推销。新书很快就能和读者见面。他们不能挑来所有的书，但如果购者要购某种书，那怕三本五本，也要派人送去。所以他们在读者中信用很高，业务也有很大发展。以后他们觉得边沿区群众更需要读到关于时局的书籍。于是进一步挑着“蒋军必败”等时局论者和新的小学课本，深入绛翼公路上的乡村小学校。这里干部群众从来想看书而买不到，现在书挑子突然出现在门口，引起他们很大惊奇和兴奋，所以每次都可以推销两三万元的书。更新同志每离开一个村庄，小学教员总是殷殷嘱托他：“下次再来。”（何微）
