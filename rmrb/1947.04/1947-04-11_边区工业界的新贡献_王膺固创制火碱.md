　　New Contribution from the Border Region's Industrial Sector
    Wang Yinggu Successfully Creates Caustic Soda
    [This Newspaper Report] The Yongsheng Chemical Industrial Cooperative, with the support and leadership of the Border Region Government amidst various difficulties over the past six months, and through the meticulous research of technician Wang Yinggu and the united efforts of all employees under the leadership of manager Shi Li, has successfully trial-produced caustic soda and sodium sulfide. The quality of the caustic soda is 25% higher than that of foreign caustic soda sold on the market, and the cost is 50% lower than the market price. It is now being manufactured in large quantities. The cooperative's soap factory is now completely self-sufficient in alkali, and will soon be able to sell it externally. During the trial period, both technician Wang and manager Shi stayed up for two or three nights watching the furnace. During the renovation, technician Wang Yinggu personally participated and worked as hard as the workers. His spirit of serving the people diligently and conscientiously has had a great impact on all employees. Our region is rich in raw materials for alkali production. The successful production of alkali has made a great contribution to the development of light and heavy industries in the Border Region. The Construction Department of the Border Region Government has sent letters to technician Wang and manager Shi to reward them and encourage them to humbly study and continue their efforts.

    王膺固创制火碱
    【本报讯】永生化学工业社半年来在种种困难情况中及边府扶植领导下，经过王膺固技师的细心研究，及史励经理领导全厂员工的一致努力，火碱硫化碱已试制成功，较市售之外来火碱质量高百分之二十五，成本比市价低百分之五十，现正大量制造。该社肥皂厂，用碱已完全自给，不久将可向外出售。在试验期间，王技师、史经理都两三夜不合眼的看着炉子，装修时王膺固技师亲自动手，和工人一样劳作，艰苦认真为人民服务的精神，对全厂员工影响很大。我区制碱原料蕴藏很富，制碱成功对边区轻重工业的发展均有极大贡献，边府建设厅特函王技师、史经理，予以奖励，并勉励虚心研究，继续努力。
