　　Adapting to War Circumstances
    Precisely Organizing Labor
    Licheng Mobilizes for Large-Scale Production
    [This newspaper's Licheng dispatch] Following the land investigation campaign last winter, Licheng County's farmers reclaimed nearly 53,900 mu of land, and 4,589 poor and tenant farmers received enough land to cultivate. At the beginning of this month, an enlarged conference of county and district cadres was held to study how to carry out this year's production campaign. During the discussion, it was unanimously agreed that necessary compensation should first be given to middle peasants and genuinely hardworking rich peasants who were harmed during the land reform movement. The example of Shi Cunjin's success should be used in conjunction with education to dispel the "cutting the chives" and "fear of getting rich" mentality among the masses. In addition, some village cadres have the muddled thinking of "anyway, we just till and eat, enough to eat and wear," and thus engage in extravagance and waste. For example, Zizhen put on one opera performance last year, but this year insists on putting on two good performances, while Dongshet even wants to put on three good performances. These phenomena should be educated and overcome.

    Secondly, two kinds of muddled thinking were also found among county and district cadres: one is complacency, failing to recognize that the requirement of this year's production policy is to universally achieve "cultivate three, surplus one." The other is failure to recognize that this year's new situation is an unprecedented shortage of labor. These two kinds of thinking affect the promotion of the current movement. One is that in the face of new difficulties, they have lost confidence and lack the initiative to solve the contradiction between production and participation in the war effort. We must face this year's new situation and new requirements, scientifically organize all labor (combining production with participation in the war effort), precisely calculate everything, save manpower, and well develop the experience of the entire county organizing a counter-offensive and carrying out large-scale war support production after the Japanese surrendered. The conference resolved that, in terms of approach, it should combine solving ideological obstacles to production, conduct a comprehensive mobilization of production ideology, and, based on the labor organization direction of combining agricultural and sideline production with participation in the war effort, rectify mutual aid teams, implement unified work exchange accounting and profit distribution, and strictly implement the policy of equivalent profit distribution. Special attention should be paid to supporting the production of newly emancipated poor and tenant farmers. This year's production should still focus on agriculture, combined with sideline occupations. Agricultural production should focus on tool improvement and technological improvement, promoting two-legged seeders, small harrows, and small carts, promoting the planting of 40,000 mu of cotton, 46,000 mu of "Golden Queen" corn, 300 mu of indigo, and 2,000 mu of "811" millet. Every cadre should not only be a production organizer but also a technical guide, ensuring that the land is harrowed universally in the spring, millet is hoed twice, corn is hoed three times, and cotton is hoed five times. Textile production is the key to universally achieving "cultivate three, surplus one" and enabling peasants to become prosperous, so the textile campaign must be insisted on and implemented throughout the year, weaving 660,000 jin of cloth throughout the year, achieving "buy cotton, don't buy cloth, sell cloth, don't sell cotton." While engaged in production, attention must also be paid to saving for disaster preparedness and supporting the front lines. Currently, each district is organizing cadres, heroes, and activists to conduct a large-scale production mobilization. (Joint Office)

　　适应战争情况
    精确组织劳力
    黎城动员大生产
    【本报黎城讯】黎城经过去冬的查田运动，全县农民收回土地将近五万三千九百余亩，四千五百八十九户贫雇农分得了够耕种的土地。本月初召开县区扩大干部会议，研究如何开展今年的生产运动，讨论中一致认为：首先是在土地改革运动中被伤害了的中农及真正劳动起家的富农应给以必要的补偿，并以石寸金的发家事例结合教育，解除群众中存在的“割韭菜”、“怕发家”思想。此外还有些村干部有“反正刨刨吃吃，够吃够穿就行啦”的思想，便大肆铺张浪费。如子镇去年唱一台会戏，而今年偏偏要唱两台好戏，东社还想唱三台好戏。这些现象都应加以教育克服。
    其次在县区干部中还发现有两种糊涂思想：一个是自满情绪，不认识今年生产方针的要求是普遍实现耕三余一。二是不认识今年新的情况是劳力空前缺乏。这两种思想影响着对当前运动的推动，一种是在新的困难情况下，已经失掉信心，缺乏主动去解决生产与参战支差矛盾的观念。必须面对今年新情况与新要求，将全部劳力科学的组织起来（生产与参战支差结合），处处精确计算，节约民力，要很好的发扬日寇投降后，全县组织反攻，进行战勤生产大变工的经验。大会决议在作法上应结合解决生产思想障碍，进行全面生产思想大动员，并根据农副业生产与参战支差相结合的劳力组织方向，整顿互助组，实行统一变工计工与分红，严格等价分红政策。特别注意扶植新翻身的贫雇农生产。今年生产仍应以农为主，结合副业。农业生产着重工具改良与技术的提高，推广两条腿耧、小耙、小车，推广植棉四万亩，金皇后四万六千亩，靛三百亩，八一一谷二千亩。作到春天普遍耙地，谷锄两次，玉茭锄三次，棉花锄五次，每个干部不仅是个生产组织者，而且是个技术指导者。纺织是普遍实现耕三余一与农民发家致富的关键，因此必须将纺织运动坚持贯彻到全年，全年织六六万斤布，作到买花不买布，卖布不卖花。与生产同时又须注意节约备荒，支援前线。现在各区正在分头组织干部英雄与积极分子，进行生产大动员中。（联合办公室）
