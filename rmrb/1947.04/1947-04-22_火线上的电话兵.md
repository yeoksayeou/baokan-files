    The Telephone Soldier on the Front Line
    Liu Zhi
    One: Checking the Line

    Cotton-like snowflakes had been falling for three whole days and were still coming down incessantly. The accumulated snow covered pedestrians' knees.

    The line from Quanyu to Qi County was down. The people sent to check the line hadn't returned with any news after a whole day. Everyone was as anxious as ants on a hot pot. Telephone squad leader Wang Lianzhu paced back and forth on the floor, looking at the sky from time to time; the snow continued to fall.

    They couldn't delay any longer. Near dusk, he took telephone soldier Wang Shichang to check the line. This line was sixty-odd *li* long and required crossing six major mountains. The sky merged with the snow, the snow with the sky, a vast expanse of white. Carrying the equipment on their backs, they walked with deep and shallow steps. After crossing two mountains, they were covered in sweat. The snow inside their cuffs and socks was melting. A short rest, and they'd freeze stiff. As it gradually got dark, Wang Shichang looked at the sky, thinking, "The squad leader is an experienced veteran, and I'm a Communist Party member. What would people think if we didn't complete the task?"

    The broken line was buried in the snow, invisible and untouchable. They had no choice but to follow the utility poles, checking one after another.

    By the latter half of the night, the line was still not working. Everyone was hungry, and combined with the cold and fatigue, it was really difficult to keep going.

    They returned after fixing the line at dawn, their faces yellowed, their hands frozen and unresponsive, their clothes stiff and clanging with frozen snow and dirt, and with several holes in them.

    Two: Listening for the Ring

    The telephone soldier of the Second Squad, Ji Xiao, was young and got the line connected two hours earlier than the First Squad.

    The Eighth Regiment was attacking Mashou, and the troops were advancing rapidly through the mud. Ji Xiao thought, "If I get the line connected a minute earlier, the leaders can speak a word earlier, and the victory of the troops will be that much greater." He volunteered to help the First Squad set up the line, standing on the hilltop, waiting for the ring on the line. At this time, autumn rain was pattering down, and in the pitch-black night, he was alone guarding the bell. By the time the bell rang, his whole body was completely soaked.

    Three: Setting up the Line

    During the battle of Jizhen Village, they had to get past the enemy blockade to connect the telephone line to Zhoujia Village. At that time, the surrounding villages were engulfed in flames. Bullets crisscrossed overhead, and signal flares shot around like fireflies. The sounds of charging and killing and the tragic cries of residents came from the village.

    Lianzhu led several telephone operators, groping forward. When crossing the river, in the October weather, everyone wanted to take off their shoes, but Lianzhu said, "Hurry up! Don't take them off." "Splash! Splash!" They crossed. They met a medic who said Zhoujia Village wasn't ahead. Everyone panicked. Lianzhu said, "How can we not complete the task?" So they continued forward. The civilians were tired, so they carried the telephone wires on their backs, and finally connected the line.

    火线上的电话兵
    刘志
    一  查线
    棉絮般的雪片，整整下了三天，还在不停的下，积雪盖过了行人的膝盖。
    从泉峪通祁县的线不通了，查线的人一天也不见回讯，大家焦灼的象热锅上的蚂蚁。电话班长王连柱，在屋地上，走来走去，不时看看天，雪还不停地下着。
    时间不能再迟了，将近黄昏的时候，他带电话兵王世昌去查。这条线，六十多里，要翻六个大山，天连雪，雪连天，白茫茫一片。背着机子，深一脚，浅一脚，走了两个山，累得他俩满头大汗，袖口、袜筒内的雪也融化着，稍一停歇，就冻僵了。天渐渐黑了，王世昌看看天，想：“班长是老班长，我又是个共产党员，要完不成任务，叫人该怎办？”
    断了的线，埋在雪里，看不见，摸不着，只好顺着线杆，查了一根再查一根。
    到了后半夜，线还是不通，大家肚子都饿了，再加上冻和累，确实难支持。
    天亮时查通线回来了，脸是黄黄的，手冻的不作主，衣服和雪土凝的当当发响，还有了几个窟窿。
    二  听铃
    二班电话兵希纪小，架通线比一班早两点钟。
    八团进攻马首，部队在泥泞中急速前进着。纪小想：“早架通一分钟，首长早说一句话，队伍胜利就要大一分”，他自动的帮一班架线，站在山头上，等着线上的铃响。这时，秋雨潇潇的下着，漆黑的夜，他独自的在守铃。等到铃响了，他的全身也完全湿透了。
    三  架线
    棘针庄战斗中，要通过敌人封锁，架通周家庄的电线。当时周围村子打的火海一般，子弹交叉的由头上撩过，信号枪，象萤火虫一样乱串一气。村中传出冲锋的杀声和居民的哀号惨叫。
    连柱带着几个电话员摸索前进，过河时，十月天气，大家想脱鞋，连柱说：“快点罢！不要脱了”。“扑通！扑通！”的一下过去了，碰见个卫生员，他说周家庄不在前边。大家慌起来，连柱说：“不完成任务还行？”于是他们又前进了，民夫累了，他们背起电线，终究架通了线。
