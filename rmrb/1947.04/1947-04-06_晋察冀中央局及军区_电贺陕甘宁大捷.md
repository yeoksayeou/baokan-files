    [Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 3rd] The Jin-Cha-Ji Central Bureau and Military Region have sent a telegram to congratulate the great victory in Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia. The original telegram stated: "We are delighted to hear of the great victories in both the north and south of Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia, which has greatly excited the military and civilians. After the retreat from Linyi, there was a great victory in Central Shandong. Now, less than six days after the evacuation of Yan'an, there is a great victory on the 25th, causing heavy losses to the Chiang-Hu troops. This fully demonstrates the brilliant and correct strategic policy of our Party Central Committee and the bravery and skill of the Northwest People's Liberation Army. The military and civilians in our region will continue to make persistent efforts to annihilate large numbers of Chiang's troops in order to cooperate with the victory on the western battlefield."
