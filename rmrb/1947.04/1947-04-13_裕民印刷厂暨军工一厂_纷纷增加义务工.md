Yumin Printing Factory and Military Industry Factory No. 1
Increase Voluntary Labor One After Another

[This Newspaper's Report] After the Yumin Printing Factory under the Border Region Government saw the challenge conditions issued to all printing factories in the region by the Yongxing Bureau's First Factory, they immediately proposed launching a major production competition. The Workers' Union then convened a general meeting to discuss the establishment of a production competition committee, dividing it into nine production competition groups based on the nature of the work. Each group and individual had detailed plans for production, conservation, and learning. It was stipulated that the first phase would be until the "May 1st" Labor Day, with a preliminary summary and initial selection of labor heroes; the second phase would be until "August 1st," with a final summary and formal election of labor heroes. In order to promptly reflect the competition situation in various departments and commend models, a "Life Broadcasting Station" was set up in the dining hall, with fifteen correspondents voluntarily writing articles to disclose information in real-time; this would save meeting time and allow everyone to devote more time to spare-time production. It is also planned to publish a wall newspaper once a month and hold an entertainment evening once a month to regulate the factory's intense life.

The competition movement officially began on the 17th of last month. In addition to the daily ten-hour workday, many people requested to increase voluntary labor on Sundays. After everyone's discussion, it was decided to add one day per month, changing from a one-day-off-per-week system to a one-day-off-per-ten-days system.

Work enthusiasm has been greatly increased. According to the statistics of eight days of competition: the production quantity of each group has increased sharply, and the quality of various products has not decreased at all. In terms of conservation, administrative staff have become self-sufficient in stationery, using waste paper for office work. Most workers have returned or stopped receiving aprons, sleeves, and soap, and have proposed guarantees to take good care of various tools and learn to repair minor machine problems; not waste a drop of ink or a sheet of paper; not lose a single tack or a single lead character; even the comrades who engrave lead characters collect lead dust to recast characters. The relationship between masters and apprentices has been greatly strengthened. Ma Mingwen and Chai Tonglin, the foremen of the typesetting group, both plan to teach two apprentices how to piece together patterned plates and two people how to piece together simple plates before July; and teach the whole group to recognize English letters. Zhang Mingquan and Zhao Qianxiang, the foremen of the letterpress printing machine, both plan to teach apprentices how to load paper, check ink, and repair minor problems within three months. All employees carry out agricultural production in their spare time, and when they are not farming, they engage in sideline production such as delivering books, transporting grain, making hemp ropes, and folding book pages, which is closely integrated with the factory's work and is convenient for both public and private purposes. Comrades such as Zhang, the deputy manager in his forties, Zhou Zigao, the director of the engineering department, and Han Wenbing, the secretary, take turns cooking in the small kitchen. Wang Yigang, the proofreader, in addition to proofreading two or three times the manuscripts of about 20,000 words every day, also squeezes out time to carry nine loads of water, collect manure, and plow the land, and voluntarily proposes to hand over 200 catties of public rice. After seeing the news of the comfort bag movement launched by the Border Region Government and other agencies, all employees of the factory responded enthusiastically and are now working day and night to rush production.

[This Newspaper's Report] In response to the call from the Political Department of the Military Industry Department Workers' Union to dedicate a piece of artillery equipment to the meritorious troops on the front line, the Machinery and钳工departments and the inspection section of Military Industry Factory No. 1 dedicated a total of 347.5 voluntary workdays in March, equivalent to more than 130,000 yuan. Comrades such as Li Shuhua, Chen Hongrui, Hou Chungui, and Zhang Wenming contributed the most workdays. After the announcement of the conservation regulations, everyone enthusiastically implemented them. Director Li and Engineer Li reduced their monthly salaries by one grade. Worker Zhao Jiaqi proposed to donate one voluntary workday per month from April to July, and also proposed to automatically save 25 catties of rice and 9 square feet of cloth per month from March, and donate them to the Party Committee Cooperative; Accountant Ma and two salespersons all voluntarily proposed 1,000 yuan to support the front line. This call is now in full swing. (Lü Yan)

[Another Report] In order to strive to defeat Chiang Kai-shek as soon as possible, the Fourth Factory of the Daxing Tobacco Company has launched an unprecedented movement of dedicating ＠dedicating money. Thirteen people will dedicate ＠152.5 per month from now until Chiang Kai-shek is defeated, tentatively calculated to be 457,500 yuan by the end of the year. (Ru Wen)

　　裕民印刷厂暨军工一厂
    纷纷增加义务工
    【本报讯】边府裕民印刷厂看到永兴局第一厂向全区印刷厂挑战条件后，即纷纷提议展开生产大竞赛。职工会乃召开大会，商组生产竞赛委员会，并以工作性质，分成九个生产竞赛小组。各组与各人均订有生产、节约与学习的详细计划。并规定到“五一”劳动节为第一期，作初步总结，初选劳动英雄；到“八一”为第二期，作最后总结，正式选举劳动英雄。为了及时反映各部门竞赛情况，表扬模范，特于饭场设立了“生活广播台”，由各组自愿报名的十五位通讯员经常写稿，即时披露；并以此节省开会时间，使大家多从事业余生产。并拟每月出版壁报一次，娱乐晚会一次，以调剂全厂的紧张生活。
    竞赛运动已于上月十七日正式开始，除每日十小时工作外，许多人要求星期日增加义务工。后经大家商定，每月增加一天，由一周作息制，改为十日作息制。
    工作热情无比提高，现据八天竞赛统计：各组生产数量激增，各种质量毫不减低。在节约方面，行政人员文具都已自给，用废纸办公。工人们，多数人都退还已领的或停领了围裙、袖套和肥皂等，并提出保证爱护各种工具，学会修理机器小毛病；不浪费一点油墨，一张纸；不丢一个洋钉，一个铅字；甚至刻铅字的同志，连铅末也要集起来再铸字。师徒关系大大加强，排字组的领班马明文和柴桐林同志都计划在七月以前教会两个学徒拚花版，两个人拚简单版；并教全组认会英文字母。铅印机领班张明全与赵谦祥同志都计划在三个月内教会学徒下纸、看墨、修理小毛病等。全体职工均于工余进行农业生产，农作之闲则从事于送书、运粮、打麻绳、折书页等副业生产，与厂里工作密切结合，公私都很便利。四十多岁的张副经理、工务部长周子高、秘书韩文炳等同志，轮流在小伙房做饭，校对王毅刚同志，每天除把二万来字的稿子校对两三遍以外，还挤出时间担九担水、拾粪、刨地，自动提出交公米二百斤。日前看到边府等各机关掀起的慰问袋运动消息后，全厂职工都热烈响应，现正日夜赶制中。（奇之）
    【本报讯】响应军工处政治部职工总会以一个炮兵连的装备献给前线有功部队的号召，军工一厂机钳两工部及检验股三月份共献义务工三百四十七个半工，合洋十三万余元，以李树华、陈鸿瑞、侯春贵、张文明等同志献工最多。节约规定宣布后，大家都热烈执行，李厂长李工长每月减少一级薪金。工人赵家起，从四月份到七月份第一月献一个义务工，并提出从三月份起每月自动节约米二十五斤、布九方尺，献给党委合作社；马会计和两个营业员，均自动提出一千元支援前线。现下这一号召正在热烈进行中。（吕炎）
    【又讯】大兴烟草公司第四厂为了争取早日打垮蒋介石，掀起了空前的献＠献金运动，十三人即日起至打败蒋介石止，每月献＠一百五十二个半，暂计到年底共洋四十五万七千五百元。（汝文）
