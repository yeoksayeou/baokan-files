　　Helping Newly Emancipated Households Buy Livestock
    Licheng County United Cooperative Establishes Credit Cooperative
    [This newspaper's Licheng dispatch] In order to promote this year's large-scale production movement and achieve the production policy of generally realizing "cultivate three, surplus one," the County United Cooperative has specially formed a "County United Cooperative Credit Cooperative." This cooperative is dedicated to supporting poor peasants and newly emancipated households in production by providing loans to help them buy livestock, farm tools, fertilizer, and other necessities. At a recent production conference in Shi'nao, loans totaling 7,860,000 yuan were used to help 41 households purchase 33 head of livestock (9 mules, 16 donkeys, and 8 oxen). Lang Baotian, a demobilized soldier from Langzhuang, did not have enough money to buy livestock. He borrowed 10,000 yuan from the "County United Cooperative" and bought a large black donkey. He smiled and said to people, "The County United Cooperative has really saved me in my time of need! I can pay off this debt after hauling coal a few times." Wang Datu and two other households from Dasi shared a donkey, but because it was inconvenient, they allocated the donkey to Xing Baichounv. Wang Datu and the other two borrowed 20,000 yuan from the County United Cooperative, and each bought a donkey.

　　帮助新翻身户买牲口
    黎城县联社设信用部
    【本报黎城讯】本县县联社为了推进今年大生产运动，达到普遍实现耕三余一的生产方针，特组成“县联社信用部”，专为扶植贫雇农新翻身户进行生产，用发放贷款的办法，帮助他们买牲口、农具、肥料等。仅日前市脑一个生产大会上，拿七十八万六千元贷款，帮助四十一户买到三十三头牲口（骡九头、驴十六头、牛八头）。郎庄荣退军人郎保田，买牲口钱不够，他到“县联社信用部”贷了一万元，买到一头大黑驴，他对人笑着说：“县联社这一下可救了我的急啦！我回去运上几次煤，就能还了这个饥荒”。大寺王大秃等三户伙分了一头驴，由于不方便，将驴算给兴白丑女，王大秃等二人到县联社贷了两万元，每人又买了一头驴。
