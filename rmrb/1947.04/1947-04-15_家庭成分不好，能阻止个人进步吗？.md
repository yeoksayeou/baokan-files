　　Can a Bad Family Background Prevent Personal Progress?
    Letter to the Editor:
    I am very happy that the supplement has a "Idea Exchange" column, as it gives me a place to talk about my problems.
    I have been studying since I was a child, from resisting the high school entrance exams to joining the joint middle school, and then transferring to Peking University. Recently, I've calculated that I've learned a lot. I am determined to be a progressive child under the banner of Chairman Mao. However, I am still very fragile and cannot withstand wind or setbacks. Therefore, in over a year of exploration, I have sometimes leaned too far to the left, and sometimes to the right, and sometimes I feel pessimistic and disappointed because I can't figure things out.
    My thinking is indeed still very naive. People around me say that I am not bad, so I usually force a smile, but the bitterness in my heart grows day by day. Therefore, I am not lively or happy, and I have earned the nickname "old scholar." I often cry, and sometimes I have even thought about suicide.
    I know that my family background is not good, and of course, this is one of the reasons why my problems cannot be solved. What I can't figure out is: "If a person's family is bad, will their thinking never be able to progress?"
    During this land reform movement, my parents committed suicide out of fear of punishment, leaving behind two old women. As a result, I have to automatically take responsibility for my family's problems. However, I have been away from home since I was a child and don't understand anything. Although I have repeatedly mobilized my family, it has been ineffective, and many problems cannot satisfy the masses. At the same time, I appear particularly backward. Although the masses are still very kind to me and haven't made things difficult for me, I still have an unresolved knot in my heart. Of course, I won't know how the leadership views me.
    I want to solve the demands of the masses but can't, and I want to progress myself but can't. Isn't this my dilemma? Therefore, I am tormented all day long and can't think straight, leaving me feeling dizzy.
    I am a young person, and my family situation has brought me to this point. I am unwilling to fall behind, and I still want to progress, but what can I do to progress? Does a person's bad family background determine that they are also bad?
    This is my problem, and this is where my thinking is confused. I hope you can give me a thorough analysis and criticism and point me to a path of progress.

    Our opinion: Comrade Lu Zhe:
    In your distress and hesitation, you still do not forget to seek progress, and you bravely and frankly raise the knot in your mind that you cannot untie and ask us to answer it. This shows that you still have confidence in the revolution and in yourself. We hope that you will increase this confidence and clearly recognize that this knot in your mind is not permanently unsolvable, and that you yourself, if you are determined and unwavering to follow the correct path, will certainly be able to make continuous progress.
    The crux of a question you repeatedly mentioned in your letter is: "If a person's family is bad, will their thinking never be able to progress?" Judging from other descriptions in your letter, your family is a target of struggle in the land reform movement, and you yourself bear some responsibility for satisfying the demands of the masses. Judging from this specific situation, your ability to progress depends on yourself, on your attitude towards the mass movement to overthrow the landlords, and on the measures you take regarding your family returning property to the peasants. Unfortunately, your letter does not provide enough detailed information in these areas. However, judging only from what your letter says, we feel that there is a path of progress that is very easy for you to take.
    Ideological knots often need to be broken through with action. Since the key lies in the family, you must start with the family. Since you grew up in a landlord's family and bear the blood debt of the peasants, you must be more determined and responsible than ordinary people in repaying it. To be honest, all your distress and unease do not stem from any immaturity, backwardness, or flaws in your own mind; they are really rooted in the exploitative relationship between your family (including yourself) and the peasants. Thoroughly overthrow this relationship, repay the blood debt, hand over the land to the peasants, hand over the internal wealth to the peasants' association, and try all means to persuade your family members not to rely on the remnants of exploitation any more, but to rely on their own labor to live. In this way, you will have cut off a feudal tail from your own family. Make the greatest determination to break through this point, so that you will not only not hinder the progress of the peasants, but also help your family members to progress. Finally, you will inevitably untie the knot in your mind and make your own progress smoothly. You have already started to mobilize your family members, which is good; but if it is ineffective, you must continue to do it like doing a revolutionary cause. As long as you are determined and sincere, and stand with the peasants to settle accounts with your own family's feudalism, you don't have to worry that the masses will be dissatisfied with you or that the leadership will not trust you. Because of your past seven or eight years of history of seeking progress, the masses have already "not made things difficult for you"; if you are really standing with the masses against feudalism today, how can they not be satisfied with you? The eyes of the masses are bright, and there are many ways. Consult with them and ask for advice, and they will definitely help you overcome difficulties.
    A person's family background can never prevent a person's progress. This fact can be proven by the people you come into contact with. The leadership never judges whether a person is making progress based on their family background and composition, but rather based on the development process of their thoughts and actions. For people from different backgrounds, it is never assumed that they will not change for the rest of their lives, but on the contrary, it is believed that they can definitely make progress through their own efforts and learning. Please be sure to understand this in your thinking. As long as you are consistent with the masses in action, discard the burden of "background hindering progress" in your mind, and unswervingly move in the direction pointed to by Chairman Mao's banner, you will definitely be able to make continuous progress.

### 家庭成分不好，能阻止个人进步吗？

　　家庭成分不好，能阻止个人进步吗？
    来信：编者同志：
    副刊设“思想交流”一栏，使我很高兴，我的心事又有说的地方了。
    我自小上学，经抗高至联中到转入北大，近来我算出学了。我决心在毛主席的旗帜下，做个进步的孩子。到底我还是十分孱羽的，经不起风吹与碰壁，所以在年多的摸索中有时过左，有时就偏右了，有时想不通表现悲观失望。
    真的我的思想还很幼稚，与我在一起的人都说我还不错，故平日也硬着笑脸，其实自己内心的苦闷与日俱增。因此不活泼不愉快，赢得了一个“老秀才”的外号。我常常哭，而且有时也曾想到自杀。
    我知道我家庭成分不好，当然也是造成自己问题不能解决的原因之一，我想不通的就是：“一个人的家庭不良，他的思想就永恒不会进步吗？”
    这次翻身运动中我家二老畏罪自杀，只剩二个老婆。这一来我家的问题，我就不得不自动担起。但我自小在外，什么也不了解；虽再三动员我家人，也无效果，好多问题不能使群众满意；同时也就显得自己格外落后了。虽群众对我还很好，没难为我，但自己内心终究是一个未解的疙瘩。当然啦，上级对我怎样看，我是不会知道的。
    欲求解决群众要求而不得，欲求自己进步而不能，这不是我的难题吗？因此终日苦闷，思想不通，弄的昏昏沉沉的。
    我是一个青年，因自己的家庭就把我弄的这个地步，我不甘心落后，我还要求进步，但我有啥办法才能进步呢？一个求进步的青年因他家不好是否就决定他也不好呢？
    这就是我的问题所在，也是我的思想糊涂的地方，望你给我彻底的分析与批判指给我一个进步途径。
    鲁哲
    我们的意见：鲁哲同志：
    在你的苦闷彷徨中，仍不忘求进步，并勇敢坦率地把你思想中解不开的疙瘩，提出来要我们解答，这表明你对革命以及对你自己，都还是有信心的。我们希望你把这种信心提高，明确地认识：你思想上的这个疙瘩并不是永不可解的，而你自己，如果决心地不动摇地循着正确道路走去，也一定可以不断进步。
    你信中一再提到的一个问题的症结是：“一个人的家庭不好，他的思想就永远不会进步吗？”再从你信中其他叙述看来，你的家庭是一个土地改革运动中的斗争对象，你自己对满足群众的要求，也负有一部分责任。从这种具体情况看来，你的能不能进步，决定于你自己，决定于你对待群众翻身运动的态度，和你对家庭归还农民财物上采取的办法。可惜来信在这些方面说的不够详细具体，然而仅就来信所说情况判断，我们觉得你是有一条很容易走上的进步的道路。
    思想上的疙瘩，常常须要用行动来突破。关键既在家庭，就要从家庭下手。既然生长在地主的家庭，背负了农民的血债，就要比一般人更决心更负责地来偿还。你的一切苦闷、不安，老实说，不起自你脑子本身的什么幼稚、落后或缺陷；实在是扎根在你的家庭（连你自己在内）和农民的剥削关系上。把这种关系彻底推翻，把血债偿还，把土地交给农民，把内财交给农会，想尽种种办法，说服家人，让他们不要再靠剥削的余物，而靠自己的劳动来生活，这样你就算从自己家庭起割掉一个封建尾巴。下最大决心，突破这一点，才能不仅不阻碍农民进步，而且帮助家人进步，最后也必然会解开思想上的疙瘩，使自己顺利地进步。你已开始动员你的家人了，这是好的；但无效果，就须要像干一件革命事业样继续来做。只要你决心地，赤诚地，站在农民一起来清算自己家中的封建，你就不用担心群众会不满意你，领导会不信任你。由于你过去七八年的求进步的历史，群众已经“没有难为你”；如果你今天真是站在群众一起反封建，他们还能不满意你么？群众的眼睛是亮的，办法是多的，和他们商量求教，他们一定会帮助你克服困难。
    一个人的家庭出身，决不能阻止一个人的进步，这种事实就是在你接触的人中间也可以得到证明。领导上决不从一个人的家庭出身和成分来判断一个人是否进步，而是从他的思想行动的发展过程来判断。对不同出身的人，决不是从肯定他终身不会变化出发，而相反地是相信着他经过自己的努力和学习，一定可以进步的。这一点，一定请你在思想上打通。只要你行动上和群众一致，思想上丢开“出身阻止进步”的包袱，毫不动摇地朝着毛主席的旗帜所指的方向走，就一定可以不断进步。
