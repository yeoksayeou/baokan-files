On the 15th, two brigades of the Chiang army's 66th Division, two regiments of the 41st Division, the entire Second Rapid Column (i.e., the 49th Brigade), and one regiment of the 40th Division, which had invaded north from Qixian on the 8th, were completely surrounded by the People's Liberation Army in the northeastern area of Qixian. As of the time of dispatch, the entire Second Rapid Column (i.e., the 49th Brigade) had been annihilated 40 li northeast of Qixian. The commander of the column (i.e., the brigade commander), Li Shouzhen, has been captured alive, and a large number of spoils have been seized. We are now expanding the gains of the battle. It is reported that Chiang Kai-shek, with the help of American imperialist weapons, only equipped two rapid columns.

    【新华社豫北前线十八日急电】人民常胜军刘伯承将军麾下，于十五日夜半，向增援汤阴之蒋军出击，取得伟大胜利。八日，由淇县北犯的蒋军第六十六师两个旅，四十一师两个团，第二快速纵队（即四十九旅）全部，及四十师一个团全部，已于十五日夜，为人民解放军团团包围于淇县东北地区。截至发电时止，已将第二快速纵队（即四十九旅）全部歼灭于淇县东北四十里处。纵队长（即旅长）李守正已被生擒，缴获甚丰。现正扩大战果中。按蒋介石在美帝国主义武器帮助下，仅装备了两个快速纵队，其第一快速纵队已于今春在鲁南战役中，被山东人民解放军全部歼灭；仅余之第二快速纵队，此次又被刘伯承将军常胜军全部俘获。
