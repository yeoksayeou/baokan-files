　　Letters to the Editor
    Editor's Note: The news report on the Gao Ping re-examination published in this newspaper on March 14th was adopted from a telegram from the Taiyue Branch. To avoid the recurrence of such situations, in addition to further strengthening editing and interviewing work in the future, and truly paying attention to conforming to reality, we especially hope that comrades directly leading the mass movement will personally write articles or regularly provide relevant materials, so that the Party newspaper can truly and promptly reflect the real situation of the movement.
                  The Editors, People's Daily:
    The article titled "Gao Ping Re-examination Discovers More Than 150 Impoverished Peasant Households Did Not Receive a Single Plot of Land During the Movement," published on page two of your newspaper on March 14th, was originally published in the Taiyue Xinhua Daily on March 13th on the first page under the title "Major Problems Discovered in Gao Ping Re-examination: 3,000 Impoverished Peasant Households Did Not Receive Land; Efforts Are Now Being Made to Adjust the Fruits of Victory, Correct Omissions, and Fill the Gaps." Because it did not conform to the facts, the County Committee sent a letter to the Taiyue Xinhua Daily to make corrections. The Taiyue Xinhua Daily made some corrections on March 21st. In order to make this news report conform to the actual situation, we hereby submit the following points for your reference:

    First, it should be acknowledged that there are shortcomings in our land reform, and some of these shortcomings are quite serious, such as the infringement on middle peasants who have not yet received full compensation for their land, individual households that have not been emancipated, and the remnants of feudalism... Therefore, after summarizing, we arranged for a re-examination. The content of the article is a summary of the previous situation.

    Second, the average land per person in Gao Ping County is 2.53 mu, while the landless poor peasants have an average of 2.15 mu per person, meaning that the 151 landless impoverished households still average more than 1.5 mu per person. Moreover, there are many reasons for not obtaining land, especially the large number of small handicraft workers in Gao Ping... Of course, there may be problems here, and we are still re-examining.

    Third, the county has a population of over 220,000, with more than 100,000 peasants obtaining land, totaling more than 110,000 mu of land. The proportion of households receiving other fruits of the revolution accounts for 88%, so those who have a considerable amount of land but are facing living difficulties have all received fruits.

    Li Buyun, County Party Secretary, Gao County

    按：三月十四日本报所载高平复查新闻，系采用太岳分社电稿。为避免重复此类情形，除今后更加强编辑与采访工作，真正注意符合实际，尤望直接领导群众运动的同志们，亲自动手写稿，或经常提供有关材料，使党报能真正做到及时反映运动的真实情况。
                  编者人民日报编辑同志：
    贵报三月十四日二版载题为《高平复查发现一百五十余户赤贫农运动中未得到一分地》一稿，原以《高平复查中发现大窟窿，三千户赤贫农没分到地，现正调整果实割遗漏尾巴填补窟窿》为题发表于太岳新华日报三月十三日第一版，因与事实不符，县委会曾给太岳新华日报社去信更正。太岳新华日报已于三月二十一日作了部分补正。为使这一新闻能符合实际情况，我们特向贵报提出如下几点说明以供参考：
    第一、首先应该承认我们土地改革当中有缺点，而且有些缺点还相当严重，如被侵犯中农，在土地上还未得到全部补偿，个别户未翻身及留下封建尾巴……等，所以我们总结后就布置了复查。该稿内容就是总结前情况。
    第二、高平全县平均土地每人二·五三亩，而未得地的贫农每人平均二·一五亩，即一五一户赤贫未得地的每人还平均一·五亩多。而且不得地原因还很多，特别是高平小手工业者较多，……等原因，当然这里面可能有问题，我们还在复查。
    第三、全县二十二万余人口，农民获得地的十万多人口，土地十一万余亩，其他分得果实面占百分之八十八（户），所以有些土地不少而生活困难者均得到了果实。
    高个县委书记  李步云
