(Reported by our newspaper from Taiyue on the 9th) The Taiyue Administrative Office recently issued an order to all levels of political and civilian cadres and all men and women compatriots in the region to immediately mobilize and actively participate in the patriotic self-defense war. The order first pointed out: Victory is already in sight, but there is still a glorious and arduous journey ahead. Past victories have depended on the wisdom and courage of thousands of heroes and the valiant and arduous struggle of all the compatriots in the liberated areas. Therefore, future victories still require all cadres and compatriots to fight bravely, continue their efforts, move forward, carry forward the glorious traditions of the past, overcome all ideas of fear of difficulty, enjoyment,麻痹, slackness, and neglect of war, widely carry out the movement to perform meritorious service for the people, and strive to produce more mass heroes and meritorious individuals. The order also pointed out the following points:

(1) Political and civilian cadres and men and women compatriots all have the obligation to directly participate in the war and support the front lines. Therefore, every cadre and compatriot should give full play to their high degree of awareness, earnestly ensure the supply of troops, actively participate in stretcher carrying, transportation, guiding the way, delivering letters, rescuing the wounded, caring for the sick, and completing all war-related tasks on time.

(2) In participating in the war, we must strictly abide by discipline, obey orders, keep military secrets, and strictly abide by war-related service hours. Otherwise, disciplinary action will be taken according to the severity of the circumstances.

(3) All power lines, telephone poles, bridges, ships, roads, factories, warehouses, and related military equipment in our area should be protected. If there is any damage, the county governments should cooperate with relevant departments to repair them immediately, and must not be perfunctory or negligent, hindering military operations.

(4) Public and private stores and factories, whether in wartime or peacetime, should conduct fair transactions and give appropriate preferential treatment to all stationed troops and marching soldiers in buying and selling operations, and must not raise market prices or take the opportunity to seek profits. Publicly operated industrial and commercial cooperatives should play an exemplary role in particular, and violators will be punished for disrupting the market.

(5) In addition to earnestly implementing the regulations on preferential treatment for military families, for families of revolutionary soldiers, the people in the rear should earnestly organize men and women, full and half labor, exchange labor and mutual assistance, and give priority to cultivating the land of those directly participating in the war at the front and militiamen, and solve the difficulties of their military families. We must ensure that those at the front participate in the war with peace of mind, and that their production is not affected.

(6) The joint military-political logistics headquarters has the power to direct the special county to complete war-related service work, and when necessary, can directly command districts and villages. County districts and villages must not resist on the grounds that there are no direct superior orders or that there are other tasks.

(7) In the participation in the war, whether it is a front or rear agency, organization, or individual, those who can complete tasks with outstanding achievements may submit a request to their superiors to report to the government for spiritual or material rewards.
