Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 19th: TASS reports: Yamaskov recently published an article in Labor Newspaper entitled "The Ruhr Question and European Security," stating: The Ruhr industrial area occupies a special position not only in Germany but throughout Europe. There is no other country in the world that concentrates such a large industrial force in a relatively small area like the Ruhr. It is the cradle of German imperialism and the citadel of expansion. Everyone knows that it was the tycoons of the Ruhr who crowned Hitler and nurtured and supported the Nazi Party.

In the hands of German imperialists, the Ruhr has often been a powerful weapon in their struggle to enslave all of Europe and dominate the world market. The enormous wealth of this largest industrial area in western Germany has long been the target of fierce competition between German monopoly groups and international—especially British and American, along with French—monopoly groups. In the past fifteen or twenty years, the Ruhr area has become a deadly knot of international financial profits. The Morgan Group, the DuPont Group, and the Wendel Group have used various methods to get involved and expand their wealth. Therefore, when the future of the Ruhr is inseparably linked to the security of Europe, the Ruhr question will inevitably become the focus of their attention. Leaving the Ruhr in the hands of German groups means the resurgence of German aggression against all European countries, which can be predicted in advance. However, the industrial and financial oligarchs of Britain, the United States, and France are connected to the Ruhr, and they hope to seek their own interests in the Ruhr in their own ways. The agreement on the economic merger of the British and American zones in the British and American occupation zones effectively expands the influence of American capital on the Ruhr area. This agreement gives Britain and the United States the fullest opportunity to harm the interests of other countries in the Ruhr area.

One more point should be stated, namely, that German industrial and financial circles will never lose the hope of using American capital to make the Ruhr, as before, a political and economic driving force for German reactionary forces. These reactionary forces are already prepared to serve their lucky partners, sharing not only their profits but also their privileges. The current activity of the remnants of Hitler in the West is directly related to the protective policies of British and American control. Recent reports on the rise in stock prices of German factories, especially in the Ruhr, further indicate how the hopes of German monopolists for a resurgence have risen. Therefore, only the democratization of Germany and joint control by the four powers can prevent those plans that attempt to use the Ruhr and even the whole of Germany to directly oppose the interests of European security.

### 苏联劳动报著论指出：  鲁尔是纳粹的摇篮  不能留在反动集团手里

    苏联劳动报著论指出：
    鲁尔是纳粹的摇篮
    不能留在反动集团手里
    【新华社陕北十九日电】塔斯社讯：雅马斯科夫顷以“鲁尔问题与欧洲安全”为题于劳动报上著文称：鲁尔工业区不仅是在德国而且是在全欧洲占有特别的地位，在世界上没有别的国家有象鲁尔这样在比较小的地区内集中这样大的工业力量，它是德国帝国主义的摇篮，扩张的卫城。谁都知道，正是鲁尔的大亨们无冕于希特勒，养育并扶植起纳粹党。
    鲁尔在德国帝国主义者的手里，常常是他们奴役全欧洲及统制全世界市场斗争中有力的武器。这个德国西部最大工业区的巨大的财产，久已是德国独占集团及国际——尤其是英美同法国——独占集团间猛烈争斗的目标。在过去十五或廿年中，鲁尔区结成了一个国际金融利润的死疙瘩。摩根集团、杜邦集团同温德尔集团用各种办法插足其间，而开拓他们的财富。所以当未来的鲁尔与欧洲的安全不可分割地联在一块时，鲁尔问题是必然成为他们注意的焦点。把鲁尔留在德国集团的手里，就意味着德国侵略全欧洲各国的再起，这是事先可以断言的。但是英美法的工业和金融寡头们是与鲁尔有联系的，他们希望着各自以自己的方法去谋取在鲁尔的利益。英美占领区内英美经济合并的协议，实际上是使美国资本对鲁尔区扩大影响。这个协议给英美最充分的机会，在鲁尔区内去损害别国的利益。
    还有一点应该申述的，即德国工业及金融界是决不丧失这种希望——借美国资本的帮助去使鲁尔和以前一样，重新变成德国反动力量的政治经济动力。这些反动力量今天已经预备去为他们的幸运的伙伴服务，不仅分享其利润，而且分享其特权。目前西部希特勒残余分子的活跃，就是与英美管制的保护政策直接相关连的。最近关于德国尤其是鲁尔工厂股票价格的上涨的报告，更指示出德国独占者再起的希望是如何的上升了。所以，只有德国的民主化及四强共同管制，才能防止那些企图利用鲁尔以至全德国来直接反对欧洲安全利益的计划。
