　　Introducing Yangfan Village Credit Cooperative, Xingtai
　　Gen Shu
　　Regarding the establishment of the Yangfan Village Credit Cooperative in Xingtai, we spoke with the village cooperative and village cadres several times to understand that the cooperative's direction—production—was relatively correct. We also learned about the difficulties faced by the masses—lack of production funds. Simultaneously, in conversations with village cadres, they all felt that after the landlords were overthrown, they themselves were in a dead end, and when there were difficulties, there was not even a place to borrow money. Seeing that they had this need, we promoted and explained the benefits of organizing a credit cooperative to them. They unanimously agreed that it would be good and were willing to establish it quickly. It was decided to extract 300,000 yuan from the cooperative's funds as credit funds. The bank, in order to support its development, also loaned 500,000 yuan, and it was established last November.

　　This credit cooperative was established at the request of the cadres, and the broad masses were not yet aware of it, so at the beginning, it was only nominally functional. Later, the cooperative director, Song Rulian, seeing this situation, took the initiative to find a few households to chat with, asking them what production they were engaged in. They said, "What production? We're just resting every day!" Song Rulian then said, "Produce! If you don't have capital, you can get a loan from the credit department!" As a result, not only did they themselves take out loans for production, but they also advertised everywhere: "We have already taken out loans from the credit department. If you don't have capital for production, you can also get a loan from the credit department. If you don't need the money, you can deposit it to earn interest." After this promotion, the business became greatly active. From last November to the end of January this year, the operating statistics are as follows: 1. Absorbed deposits: A total of 385,010 yuan in current deposits were absorbed. 2. Loans issued: Small business loans (mainly for carrying goods) 350,000 yuan, industrial loans 153,000 yuan, transportation loans 768,000 yuan, agricultural and sideline loans 10,000 yuan, totaling 1,281,000 yuan.

　　If calculated solely from the interest income on deposits and loans, it is very little. After paying deposit interest, the income from interest alone was only 32,750 yuan in two months. If calculated from the profit gained by the masses through loans, it is much greater. Through loans combined with idle funds of 617,000 yuan, three more carts, five cattle, three donkeys, one cotton gin, and one sock knitting machine were added in two months. In addition, a profit of 286,600 yuan was gained. This is much more profitable than the cooperative directly engaging in commerce.

　　A few points of experience: 1. First, clear the thinking of the cadres, establish it from top to bottom, and then try to obtain the understanding and support of the broad masses in order to develop and consolidate it. 2. After the masses accept and understand, using their own practical examples to publicize to the outside world is more effective than our publicity and achieves faster results. 3. The credit cooperative should be established on the basis of the cooperative and become a part of the cooperative. Because it has a mass base, it will neither lose money nor collapse.

　　介绍邢台羊范村
    信用合作社
    根舒
    邢台羊范村信用合作社的成立，曾经我们几次和该村合作社及村干部谈话，了解该村合作社方向——生产——比较正确，又了解到群众困难——缺乏生产资金，同时在和村干等谈话中，他们都感到把地主斗垮了，自己则成了死门，有困难吧，连个借钱的地方也没有了。看到他们有此要求，我们就把组织信用社的好处给他们作了宣传解释，他们一致认为这倒好，都愿意很快成立起来。决定从合作社抽出卅万元资金作为信用资金，银行为了扶植其发展，又贷款五十万元，去年十一月即成立了。
    这个信用社是在干部要求下成立起来的，广大群众尚不了解，所以在一开始是有名无实，后来合作社长宋汝连看到这样情形，就主动去找了几户闲谈，问他们在搞啥生产，他们说：“生啥产，每天光歇着哩！”宋汝连即说：“生产吧！没本可到信用部贷款呀！”这样一来，不但他们自己贷了款去生产，同时又到处向别人宣传：“我们已从信用部贷了款，你们如生产没本，也可到信用部去贷款。钱用不着还能存去得利。”经过这样宣传，业务即大大活跃起来，从去年十一月到今年一月底经营统计如下：１、吸收存款：共吸收活期存款三十八万五千零一十元。２、放出贷款：小商贷款（主要担挑）三十五万元，工业贷款十五万三千元，运输贷款七十六万八千元，农副业贷款一万元，共一百二十八万一千元。
    如单从存放款利息收入来算是很少的，两个月除付存款息外，仅收入利息三万二千零七千五元。如从群众贷款得利来计算就大了，经过贷款结合游资六十一万七千元，两个月共增加大车三辆，牛五头，驴三头，轧花机一架，织袜机一架，另外还得利二十八万六千六百元。这样比合作社直接经营商业等得利大多了。
    几点经验：１、首先打通干部思想，从上而下成立起来，再设法取得广大群众了解与拥护，以求发展巩固。２、群众接受了解后，用自己实际例子向外宣传，比我们宣传起作用，收效也快。３、信用社要建立在合作社条件的基础上，成为合作社一部分，因有群众基础，既不会赔钱，又不致垮台。
