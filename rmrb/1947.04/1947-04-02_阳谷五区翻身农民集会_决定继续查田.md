(Jilu Yu [Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region] News Agency, 31st) The Fifth District of Yanggu County held an emancipated peasants' celebration rally in Anle Town on the 24th of this month, deciding to continue the land investigation movement. More than 10,000 people from all walks of life, including farmers' associations, militia, women's associations, sister groups, children's corps, and Jilu Yu military officer training groups, attended. The 82 villages of the emancipated peasants wore red and green, twirling the Yangko dance, playing with lions, carrying golden pots, large ingots and other fruits of emancipation. Drums and gongs shook the sky as they marched into the venue. Cheers and slogans echoed through the clouds. At 4:00 PM, the meeting began with three cannon salutes. More than 10,000 peasant women and children stood at attention and took off their hats, bowing to the statue of Chairman Mao. The chairman announced the significance of the conference as a celebration of emancipation, and called on everyone to continue the land investigation to completely eliminate feudalism. Yang Bai, an emancipated woman, spoke on stage, her lips trembling with excitement, saying: "I used to beg for food, suffer from cold, and go hungry, but now I am emancipated. Today I came just to see Chairman Mao. He led us to emancipation, he is our great benefactor." Pain and excitement made her unable to continue. Then a KMT officer who joined the Eighth Route Army said sadly: "When I saw the people in the liberated areas were all emancipated, had food to eat, clothes to wear, and land to cultivate, I thought of my hometown, and I was very sad that my parents were still living a miserable life. Now there are still thousands of fathers, brothers and sisters in the KMT-controlled areas who have not been emancipated, and I feel very sad." The conference finally unanimously decided to continue the land investigation and suppress feudalism, and each village proposed competitions to ensure the completion of land reform in conjunction with wartime support work.

　　阳谷五区翻身农民集会
    决定继续查田
    【本报冀鲁豫卅一日电】阳谷县五区于本月廿四日在安乐镇举行农民翻身庆祝大会，决定继续开展查田运动。到会者计有农会、民兵、妇女会、姊妹团、儿童团及冀鲁豫军官教导团等各界群众万余人。全区八十二村的翻身农民穿红戴绿，扭着秧歌、玩着狮子、抬着金锅子、大元宝等各种翻身果实，锣鼓喧天地步入会场，欢呼和口号响彻云霄。午后四时，鸣炮三声开会，一万多个农民妇女和儿童全体肃立脱帽，向毛主席像鞠躬。主席宣布大会意义为庆祝翻身，并号召大家继续查田，彻底消灭封建。扬百一个翻身的妇女上台讲话，她兴奋得嘴唇发抖说：“我过去要饭挨冻挨饿，现在翻了身。今天来就是为了来看看毛主席，他领着俺翻了身，他是俺的大恩人。”痛苦和兴奋使她再也说不下去。接着一个参加八路军的蒋军军官悲愤地说：“我见到解放区的人民都翻了身，有吃有穿，有了地种，就想到了我的家乡，我的父母还过着悲惨的生活就很难过。现在蒋管区还有千千万万的父老兄弟姊妹们没有翻身，我感到非常悲痛。”大会最后一致决议继续查田查封建，各村并提出竞赛，保证结合战勤工作，完成土地改革。
