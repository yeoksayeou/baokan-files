Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 20th: Since the latter part of last month, the military and civilians in the Lu Nan mountain area have been engaged in an anti-"encirclement and suppression" struggle. The military and civilians outside the mountain area simultaneously launched containment battles. According to incomplete statistics, in more than two hundred large and small battles in twenty days, over 3,800 Chiang troops were killed or wounded, and over twenty enemy puppet district and township regimes and strongholds, including the important town of Lanling, were destroyed. Since the end of last month, Chiang's troops, including the 11th, 82nd, 74th, 25th, 77th, and 59th Divisions, have launched "encirclement and suppression" operations from towns such as Sishui, Zou County, Teng County, Lin County, Yi County, and Zaozhuang along the Lin (Yi) Zi (Yang), Teng (County) Zi (Yang) and other highways toward Baiyan, Liangqiu in the center of the mountain area, and the mountainous area of Pingyi to the north. The local military and civilians resisted step by step, firing guns on every mountain, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy. The enemy troops of Feng Zhi'an advancing on the southern route suffered more than 200 casualties on January 27 when they advanced to Shangxia Shihe on Mount Baoduguo. The enemy 83rd Division advancing on the eastern route encountered more than 30 ambushes by the militia on the Lin (Yi) Fei (County) highway, killing or wounding more than 100 enemy soldiers below the company commander level. In more than ten days, they only advanced more than forty li. On the afternoon of the 30th, the enemy on the southern route ventured into the Liangqiu area, but were counterattacked within three hours and fled south in panic. The local military and civilians intercepted them along the way, capturing three 60mm mortars and nineteen machine guns. Thus, the enemy's attempt to converge in Liangqiu was shattered for the first time, forcing the enemy to retreat to Chengqian, Feicheng, Sishui, Yi County, Zaozhuang and other places. At the beginning of this month, the enemy troops from various routes gathered their forces again and launched a large-scale attack on Gukou, Mount Baoduguo, Loushui, Mount Tianbao, Baiyan, Liangqiu, Pingyi and other places. On the 5th, the local military and civilians annihilated more than 200 enemy troops invading Yan Mountain. By the morning of the 7th, a total of 400 enemy troops had been killed or wounded in two battles, and over 420 enemy soldiers below the battalion commander level were captured alive, along with eleven light machine guns, one 60mm mortar, over eighty rifles, and over 10,000 rounds of ammunition. Currently, the enemy "encircling and suppressing" the mountainous area has retreated to the Baiyan, Guanyang, and Liangqiu line under resistance and harassment. The area north of Baiyan, from Pingyi to Shanyin, Tancheng, and from Mount Tianbao to Fengyang, is free of enemy traces.
