Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 10th: In Laiyang County, Jiaodong, which was recently liberated again, more than 680 landlords and merchants who had been deceived by the Chiang army to go to Weixian have fled back. It is reported that after they arrived in Weixian, a large number of young and middle-aged men were forced to be编入 into the student soldier camps, and the system of joint guarantee was adopted to prevent escape. Those without guarantors were immediately detained. Because the Chiang-puppet regime in that area extorted in every possible way and prices soared, many deceived landlords became beggars, and many women fell into prostitution. After Mao Hualin from Shahe Town went to Weixian, his daughter was forcibly married off by the Chiang army. In less than a month, because she had no food or clothing, she was forced into prostitution again, and she hanged herself out of shame. The merchant Li Mingchuan took 300,000 Chiang coins with him, but it was all used up in less than 20 days. He had no choice but to sell his clothes to make travel expenses to return home, full of regret. Even Miao Chunting, the chairman of the Chiang-sponsored "Refugee Association," could not make a living and forced his wife and daughter to perform operas to make money and live on thin porridge.

　　地主逃到潍县
    流为乞丐娼妓
    【新华社山东十日电】月来重获解放之胶东掖县，前被蒋军骗往潍县之地主、商人已有六百八十余人逃回。据称：彼等到潍后，大批青壮年被迫编入学兵营，并采用连环保办法，防止逃跑，无保者即行扣押。因该地蒋伪百般勒索，物价腾涨，不少受骗地主流为乞丐，妇女很多坠入娼门。沙河镇毛华林去潍后，女儿被蒋军强迫娶去，不到一月，因无吃穿，又被押为娼妓，致羞愧吊死。商人李明川带去蒋币三十万元，不到二十天，全部用完，只好当卖衣物作川资回乡，悔恨不已。即蒋记“难民同乡会”会长苗春亭，也无法生活，逼着妻女唱戏搞钱，喝稀饭渡日。
