Xinhua News Agency, Hua Dong Front, 1st – The Chen Wang Regiment of the “Fuzhou” Troops of the Hua Dong People’s Liberation Army has created a new method called "Long-Short Meeting" in its campaign to promote the Wang Keqin Movement. First, at the company-level soldiers' general meeting, three questions are raised: "What are your weaknesses that need help from others?", "What are your strengths that can help others?", and "What methods can be used to help each other progress faster?". This prompts everyone to discuss, find mutual assistance partners, set mutual assistance plans, and share experiences. For example, the first squad of the ninth company invited new soldiers to talk about the stories of liberated farmers in the liberated areas and invited artillerymen to introduce their experiences in defending against mortar shells. Through this new method, soldiers learn from each other, and their enthusiasm for combat has been further enhanced. According to incomplete statistics from the third battalion of the regiment, 35 skilled machine gunners and artillerymen have been discovered among the newly liberated soldiers, one of whom can disassemble a machine gun blindfolded in 20 minutes.

Xinhua News Agency, Hua Dong Front, 1st – During the long march before the Laiwu Campaign, Yu Junzhang's cooking squad of the fifth company of a certain regiment of the “Zhengzhou” Troops of the Hua Dong People’s Liberation Army, who is a model of cherishing the people, had 13 people push and transport 4,000 catties of oil, salt, vegetables without using a single civilian laborer. The regimental headquarters has now circulated his deeds of cherishing the people to the entire regiment, calling on everyone to learn from him, and awarding Yu Junzhang and others with a major merit citation.

　　华东开展王克勤运动
    创“长短会”新方式
    取长补短互相学习
    【新华社华东前线一日电】华东人民解放军“福州”部队陈王团在开展王克勤运动中，创造了“长短会”的新方式。先在连的军人大会上提出“你有什么短处需要别人帮助”，“你有什么长处可以帮助别人”，“用什么方法互相帮助进步加快”等三问题，发动大家讨论，找互助对象，订互助计划，相互介绍经验。如九连一班请新战士介绍解放区农民翻身故事，请炮手介绍防迫击炮弹的经验。通过这个新方式，战士们互相学习，战斗积极性更为提高，据该团三营不完全统计，新解放战士中发现熟练的各种机炮手达三十五人，其中一人能于二十分钟内闭目拆卸机枪。
    【新华社华东前线一日电】华东人民解放军“郑州”部队某团五连爱民模范于俊长炊事班，于莱芜战役前之长途急行军中，十三人分别推运四千斤油盐蔬菜，而未用一民夫。现团部已将其爱民事迹通报全团，号召大家学习，并予于俊长等各记大功一次。
