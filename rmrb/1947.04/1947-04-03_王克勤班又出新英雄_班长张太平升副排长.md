[Report from the Jiluyu Front, April 2nd] Another New Hero Emerges from the Wang Keqin Class: Squad Leader Zhang Taiping Promoted to Deputy Platoon Leader.

　　Because of his effective leadership of the squad, Comrade Zhang Taiping, the squad leader of the Wang Keqin Class, which produces heroes, has recently been promoted to deputy platoon leader. When he was leading the squad, he united all the comrades in the squad like one person, following the working style of Comrade Wang Keqin, and did a good job in fighting, training, and military-civilian relations. The Wang Keqin Model Class continues to leap forward in progress. Comrade Zhang Taiping had a large sore on his leg, but he persisted in his work despite continuous marching and combat during the southward and northward movements. He is also very humble and able to listen to the opinions of his comrades in the squad and learn the style of Comrade Wang Keqin. Because of the support of the masses and his meticulous and patient work, his name, like that of the Wang Keqin Class, is admired by all.

　　王克勤班又出新英雄
    班长张太平升副排长
    【本报冀鲁豫前线二日电】王克勤班英雄辈出，班长张太平同志因领导该班得法，顷被提升为副排长。他领导该班时，依照王克勤同志的工作作风，把全班同志团结得像一个人，打仗、练兵、军民关系都做得好。王克勤模范班在继续飞跃进步。张太平同志腿上生了个大连疮，在南下北返连续行军作战的情况下，仍坚持工作。平时他又非常虚心，能倾听班里同志的意见和学习王克勤同志的作风。由于群众的拥护，工作的细致耐心，他的名字和王克勤班一样为人钦慕。
