　　Support the Front Lines to Defend the Good Times
　　Liu Gaiying Voluntarily Fills in for Her Husband in Labor Service
　　[This newspaper, Taiyue, 8th dispatch] Fan Ertang of Nanyangpo Village, Tunliu Fifth District, was scheduled for labor service, but he was bedridden with illness. His wife, Liu Gaiying, volunteered to go. She said to her husband, "Supporting the front lines is to protect our own property. You are sick, so I will go." She took some dry food and a carrying pole and went to the village office. After the village cadres understood the reason, they said apologetically, "We were too careless. Your husband is sick, so you should go back and take care of him. Your family doesn't need to provide labor service." She only said one sentence, "My little daughter will take care of him," and then carried twenty-eight sets of military uniforms to the front.

　　支援前线保卫好时光
  　刘改英自动代夫支差
    【本报太岳八日电】屯留五区南阳坡村范二堂，轮到自己支差，恰恰病卧在床，其妻刘改英，便自报奋勇要去支差。她对丈夫说：“支援前线是保卫自己的财产，你病了我去。”拿上干粮和扁担便向村公所走去。村干部问明原因后，很抱歉的说：“俺们太粗心，你男人病了，你回去招护他吧，你家的差不用支了。”她只说了一句“有小女照管”，便挑了廿八套军衣往前方去了。
