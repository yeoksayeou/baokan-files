　　Develop South of the Road, Persist in South of the Road!
    Jiaozuo Militia Repeatedly Defeated Chiang's Puppets

    [Reported by this newspaper] The Jiaozuo Third District Militia responded to the call of the leaders of the Fourth Sub-district of Taihang to resolutely eliminate black spot villages (stubborn villages). On the 28th of last month, they actively cooperated with a unit of the ××th Regiment to raid villages such as Zhaodian and Fucheng. In Zhaodian, they destroyed a blockhouse, killed fifteen or sixteen puppet self-defense regiment members, and captured four. After this attack, the militia work team threatened the enemy, excited the basic masses and intermediate elements, and urgently hoped that we would come down from the mountains, like a great drought hoping for rain. Recently, those who sent grain, funds, and made contact have been coming in an endless stream. All cadres and soldiers of the Third District are highly confident and unanimously proposed: open up the south of the road and persist in the south of the road, and support the basic masses who have suffered for several months.

    On the 2nd of this month, the enemy in Lifeng aggressively attacked the Xizhangzhuang joint defense in the Jiaozuo Second District. Our battalion, together with the militia work team, gave the enemy a head-on blow, killing or wounding twelve enemies, who fled in panic. On the 3rd, the enemy, with three companies, attacked our Qiaogou (the residence of the Third District and the battalion). We lured the enemy deep and gave them a tail attack, killing or wounding nine enemies (one platoon leader of the regular army), who dragged their corpses back. Two victories in two days created a battle example of 0 to 21.

    At dawn on the 2nd, the Ren Xiuhe work team and the militia team, in coordination with a unit of the public security team, ambushed the enemy at the Hongshaling blockhouse with the firm belief of capturing prisoners. They were discovered by the enemy and confronted the enemy with grenades at close range. Our Ren Xiuhe threw stones to strike the enemy (deaths and injuries to be investigated). Although the enemy was superior in number (the enemy had seventy or eighty people, and we had fourteen), one of our men was slightly injured.

    The successive battles are all model battles in Jiaozuo City. The city headquarters specially issued a circular of commendation, calling on all commanders and fighters in the city to learn from them, make persistent efforts, and strive for greater victories.

    Comrade Wang Zeming of Jiaozuo First District cultivated the militia of Gaoyang River in hardship. When he arrived in the village, he was unfamiliar with both the people and the place. After a period of time, he developed the self-defense force and the militia, and insisted on that position. Now there are more than 40 masses who have returned to the village. This is inseparable from his meticulous and in-depth democratic style of the mass line. Especially in the stone mine movement, he gathered the masses to study the terrain and how to persist. The masses proposed that several roads needed to be blocked with mines. He went there to dig and completed hundreds of stone mines in two or three days. The mines were dug large, the stones were well chosen, and no detours were taken. The Jiaozuo City Headquarters also called on cadres and militiamen to learn from him. (Ruzhen)

    [Reported by this newspaper] On the night of March 8, the Jiaozuo Third District Militia Work Team, in coordination with the camp soldiers, a unit of the sub-district main force, and a group from the Public Security Bureau, crossed two highways and attacked Dinghe, Dong, and Xi Yu villages. They immediately killed Zhang Qinran, the deputy captain of the "Self-Defense Regiment" in Xiyu Village, and captured six people including Zhang Tingjia, the squad leader of the "Self-Defense Regiment" in Dinghe Village, seized several guns, more than twenty livestock, burned two large blockhouses, and nine sentry boxes. The "Self-Defense Regiment" ran to Jiaozuo for help, and Chiang's regular army was so scared that they did not dare to come out.

    Just as the Jiaozuo Militia and camp soldiers, in coordination with the ×th Regiment of the sub-district main force, advanced into the enemy's rear to carry out guerrilla warfare south of the Daoqing Road, a unit of Chiang's regular army from the Jiaozuo mining area went to the south of the road to reinforce and did not return. The defending enemy was panicked and ordered the "Self-Defense Regiment" to attack the mountainous area north of Jiaozuo to understand the situation as a defensive offensive. On March 16, day and night, near Maijiehe Village, Xiaozhaozhuang Village, and Baimamen Village, they stepped on eighteen landmines buried by the militia, advancing and retreating three times, suffering many casualties.

　　开展路南，坚持路南！
    焦作民兵迭创蒋伪
    【本报讯】焦作三区民兵响应太行四分区首长坚决消灭黑点村（顽固村）的号召，于上月二十八日，主动配合××部一部突击赵店府城等村，在赵店炸毁炮楼一座，毙伪自冲团十五、六人，俘四人。民兵武工队，经这次出击后威胁了敌顽，兴奋了基本群众及中间人士，迫切热望我们下山，如大旱之望雨，近日送粮送款接头者络绎不断。三区全体干部战士信心极高，一致提出：开辟路南坚持路南，给数月来受苦的基本群众撑腰。
    本月二号李封之敌逞强出击焦作二区西张庄联防，当由我营兵一部配合民兵武工队给敌以迎头痛击，敌死伤十二人，鼠窜而去。三日敌以三个中队的兵力又进袭我桥沟（三区及营兵驻地），我诱敌深入给以尾击，敌人死伤九人（正规士兵一排长一）拖尸而归。两天两捷，创造○比二十一之战例。
    二日拂晓，任秀何武工队民兵队配合公安团队一部，在坚决完成捕捉俘虏的信念下到洪沙岭炮楼处伏击敌人，被敌发觉，在近距与敌投弹对峙，我任秀何掷石击敌（死伤待查），虽因敌我众寡悬殊，（敌七八十人我十四人）我轻伤一人。
    接连着几次的战斗，均为焦作市模范战例，该市指挥部，特给以通报表扬，号召全市指战员一致学习，再接再厉，争取更大的胜利。
    焦作一区王泽明同志在坚苦中培养了高扬河的民兵。他到该村时是人地两生，他到后一个时期即发展了自卫队及民兵，坚持了那块阵地，现回村群众已有四十余人。这与他的细致深入，群众路线的民主作风是分不开的。特别在石雷运动中，他集合群众研究了地形，及如何坚持，群众提出了几条路需要用雷封锁，即到那里去打，在两三日内即完成几百个石雷，打的既大，石头选择亦好，一点湾路没走。焦作市指挥部也号召干部民兵向他学习。（汝珍）
    【本报讯】焦作三区民兵武工队配合营兵和分区主力一部及公安局一个组，于三月八日夜，穿过两条公路进袭定和、东、西于村，当即打死西于村“自卫团”副队长张钦然，捉回定和“自卫团”班长张廷家等六人，得枪数枝，牲口二十余头，烧大炮楼两座，岗房九个，“自卫团”跑到焦作求援，蒋正规军吓的不敢出来。
    正当焦作民兵营兵配合分区主力×部，挺进敌后，开展道清路南游击战争，焦作矿区蒋正规军一部到路南增援未归，守敌恐慌，叫“自卫团”出击焦作以北山地，作进攻势的防守了解情况。三月十六日一天一夜，在麦秸河村，小赵庄村，白马门村附近踏响民兵埋下的十八个地雷，三进三退，死伤甚多。
