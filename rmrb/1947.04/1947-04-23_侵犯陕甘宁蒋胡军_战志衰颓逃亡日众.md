Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th. Weariness of war, fear of war, exhaustion, and desertion are causing the fighting strength of Chiang Hu's army invading the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region to decline daily. In the battle south of Wayaobao on the 14th, in which the 135th Brigade of Chiang Hu's army was annihilated, the brigade occupied favorable positions on the mountain, but when they discovered the People's Liberation Army, they scattered in panic and hurriedly sought assistance from the 36th Division, daring neither to advance nor retreat. At this time, the People's Liberation Army overwhelmed the enemy with fierce firepower. When the PLA commanders and fighters charged up the mountain from the ravines, many Chiang Hu's soldiers sat on the ground holding their rifles, not daring to resist any further. Only a few machine guns fired sporadically and blindly. When the mountain positions were gradually occupied by the PLA, the machine guns also stopped firing; then they scattered and fled or raised their guns to surrender. According to several prisoners, "We discovered that you (referring to the PLA) were advancing on several routes, and knew that we were surrounded and it was difficult to escape. When we saw that your firepower was so fierce and your assault so brave, we were all frightened." According to a letter seized from Wu Ziqing, the commander of the 35th Regiment of the 12th Brigade, to his relative "Yunqing," "The war is very fierce, the casualties are heavy, and my survival is thanks to the virtues of my ancestors..." Currently, Chiang Hu's army is extremely timid and takes small mountain roads when moving, fearing ambushes. Climbing up and down all day makes the soldiers exhausted. In addition, each person has to carry a weight of fifty catties, making it even more difficult for the physically weak to endure. According to Zhou Shigui, a soldier of the 123rd Brigade who escaped from Panlong, "Carrying heavy loads, walking high, and not sleeping well is really uncomfortable. I think everything would be fine if I defected to the Eighth Route Army." Because the people of the border region implement a policy of clearing the fields, the supply of Chiang Hu's army is extremely difficult; they ransack everywhere, but can only find one and a half liters of millet. Many of the Chiang Hu's soldiers who came out this time only ate one or two meals of millet porridge a day. Desertion is extremely common. A certain unit of the PLA once took in more than a hundred Chiang Hu's army deserters and stragglers in one day. According to Shi Huimin, a soldier of the 24th Brigade of Hu's army who voluntarily defected to the PLA, "After entering the border region, we couldn't find food or cooking utensils. You (referring to the PLA) are familiar with the terrain and have the support of the people. Hu Zongnan will definitely be defeated. Only here is there a real future." Desertion has greatly reduced the strength of Chiang Hu's army. For example, the eighth squad of the seventh company of the third battalion of the 404th Regiment of the 135th Brigade originally had eleven men, but only six remained when it was annihilated. According to prisoners, "Since entering the border region, each squad has deserted about five or six men," that is, half of each squad is reduced.
	Xinhua News Agency, Northwest Front, 18th. In a certain place on the front line where the sound of artillery fire can be heard clearly, the reporter met Chen Jian, the commander of the 404th Regiment of the 135th Brigade of Chiang's army, who was captured in the Yangma River area south of Wayaobao on April 14th. This lieutenant colonel, a graduate of the first class of the Kuomintang Central Military Officer Training Corps, who has been in the army for twelve years, shook his head and sighed during the conversation to show his grief. He said, "When we were ordered to reach Lijiacuan, we were only a few miles away from our support troops, but they stood by and watched us being beaten." "This time we attacked the border region, we not only encountered difficulties in eating and living, but also as long as we found one or two militiamen on the surrounding hills, we were afraid, and we had to waste a lot of ammunition on these hills."
	Xinhua News Agency, Northwest Front, 20th. Mai Zongyu, the acting brigade commander, Zhu Zushu, the chief of staff of the brigade, Chen Jian, the commander of the 404th Regiment, Cheng Yaohuang, the commander of the 405th Regiment, and deputy regimental chief of staff, and other officers of the 135th Brigade of the 15th Division of Chiang's army, who laid down their weapons south of Wayaobao this month on the 14th, have been transferred from the front line to a certain unit for rest on the 17th, and will arrive safely at their destination within days. Among the above-mentioned officers, it has now been clarified that Wang Wenzhi, the acting director of the "Newsroom" of the political department of the brigade, has also been captured alive.

### 侵犯陕甘宁蒋胡军  战志衰颓逃亡日众

    侵犯陕甘宁蒋胡军
    战志衰颓逃亡日众
    【新华社陕北二十日电】厌战惧战疲惫与逃亡，使侵入陕甘宁边区蒋胡军之战力日益低弱。十四日在瓦窑堡以南歼灭蒋胡军一三五旅战斗中，该旅本据有山头有利阵地，但当发现人民解放军时，即慌忙散开，连忙向整三十六师求援，既不敢前进，亦不敢后退。此时人民解放军即以炽烈火力压倒对方。当解放军指战员自山沟冲上山头后，蒋胡军士兵多抱住步枪坐于地上。不敢再作抵抗。只有若干机枪疏落的盲目射击。及至山头阵地逐一为解放军占领时，机枪亦停止叫喊；于是四散逃亡或举枪求降。据若干俘虏称：“发现了你们（指解放军）数路前进，知道已陷入包围，很难逃脱。及至看到你们火力那么猛，突击那么勇，我们就都被吓住了。”又据缴获之十二旅三十五团团长吴子清给其亲人“云卿”信中称：“战争非常激烈，伤亡惨重，我的不死是祖宗的积德……”。目前蒋胡军极为胆怯，出动时都走小道山路，怕遭伏击。这样整天爬上爬下，使士兵疲劳不堪。加上每人要背带五十斤重量，致体弱者更难支持。据从蟠龙逃出之一二三旅士兵周士贵称：“背的重，走的高，睡不好，实在难受。我想投到八路军一切就好了。”由于边区人民实行坚壁清野，使蒋胡军给养极端困难；到处翻箱倒柜，只能搜到小米一升半合。此次出动的蒋胡军，好多一天只吃一两餐小米稀饭。逃亡极普遍，解放军某部曾在一日中收容蒋胡军逃亡及掉队者百余人。据胡军二十四旅自动投奔解放军之士兵施惠民说：“进了边区找不到粮食锅碗，你们（指解放军）地形熟，又得到老百姓拥护，胡宗南一定吃败仗。在你们这里才真有个干头。”逃亡使蒋胡军大大减员，如一三五旅四○四团三营七连八班，原十一人，当被歼时仅余六人。据俘虏称：“自进入边区，每个班逃亡约五六名不等。”即每班减员半数。
    【新华社陕北前线十八日电】在炮声历历可闻的前线某地，记者会见了四月十四日在瓦窑堡南羊马河一带被俘之蒋军一三五旅四○四团团长陈简。这位在国民党中央军官训练班第一期毕业，入伍已十二年的中校团长，他在谈话时以摇头叹气来显示他的悲哀。他说：“当我们奉命到达李家川时，和自己的接援部队相距只有几里路，然而他们却站在一边看我们挨打。”“我们这次进攻边区，不只遇到吃的住的困难，同时只要发现周围山头上有一两个民兵，我们就害怕，我们就不得不浪费许多弹药在这些山头上。”
    【新华社西北前线二十日电】本月十四日，在瓦窑堡南放下武器之蒋军一五师一三五旅高级军官代旅长麦宗禹、旅参谋主任朱祖舒、四○四团团长陈简、四○五团团长成耀煌及副团长团参谋长等军官百余人，已于十七日自前线转某部休息，日内即可安抵目的地。在上述军官中，今又查明该旅政治部“新闻室”代主任王文之亦已生俘。
