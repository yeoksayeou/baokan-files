    Greeting Victory and Defending the Land
    Border Region Farmers Enlist Enthusiastically
    [Our Special Dispatch] In Taihang, Taiyue, Jiluyu, and Jinnan, liberated farmers, in order to greet victory, defeat Chiang Kai-shek as soon as possible, and live a safe life, tens of thousands of young heroes are constantly flocking to the People's Liberation Army. At the conference of more than 20,000 farmers in Changzi, Taiyue, celebrating the return of land and armed protection of property, Liu Wenshu, Secretary of the County Committee of the Communist Party of China, called on Communist Party members, farmer association members, and militia heroes to join the army and uproot the old, poor root of Chiang Kai-shek. After separate discussions, 6,579 people enthusiastically signed up on the spot to join the army. After seven strict screenings, 3,123 strong young people were selected. Among them were 466 Communist Party members, 4 district cadres, 220 village cadres, 1,900 militiamen, and 71 students, who have now left for the Jinan front. In Qinshui Third District, 150 young people voluntarily joined the People's Liberation Army in just three days. In Lin County, Taihang, due to the thoroughness of this land reform, the level of awareness of the liberated farmers has been unprecedentedly improved. All 12 districts in the county overfulfilled their tasks by 100% to 300%. The original quota was 2,300 people, but 3,683 were completed. After careful selection, 2,628 strong young people remained to enter their own ranks. In Guancheng, Jiluyu, after the land reform, farmers automatically demanded to protect the fields and join the army.
    Farmers in Yanggu County spontaneously launched a competition to enlist in the army. When electing models in the land reform movement, many people used their automatic enlistment and leading the masses to join the army as their campaign conditions. The model militia squad leader of Xiaokeng Village in the Fifth District was over forty years old, his wife had died, and his eldest son had already joined the army. He placed his ten-year-old daughter with relatives, and he and his sixteen-year-old second son were going to join the army. In Xuliangfu and Chuancang villages in the Sixth District, they competed to be model villages at the district election conference. They argued endlessly, and then proposed to compete by enlisting in the army. When the Fifth District elected model military dependents, it was based on the number of people who had joined the army from each family. A glorious atmosphere of joining the army has formed throughout the county. At the recollection meetings in Nanfeng, farmers throughout the county generally recognized that if the Chiang government is not eliminated, liberation will not be successful. Therefore, in just ten short days, 1,466 good men flocked to join the army. Yunxi Normal School and the Seventh Middle School also had 96 young students who abandoned their pens and joined the army. A surge of enthusiasm for joining the army has been set off in Qiuxian, Jinnan. From March 21st to March 31st, in ten days, 538 young and strong men in the county voluntarily went to the front line. In Maluobao, the First District, 41 young heroes collectively joined the army in three days. A women's association member in Matou persuaded her husband to join the army, saying: "Go to the front and fight Chiang Kai-shek well. You must strive to be a hero in killing the enemy. I will weave cloth and make shoes for the soldiers at the front at home, and I will be a model woman in supporting the front."
