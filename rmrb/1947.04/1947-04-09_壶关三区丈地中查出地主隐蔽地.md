　　Huguan Third District Discovers Landowners' Hidden Land During Land Measurement
    [Our Newspaper] In the gaps while waiting for stretchers to return to the villages and be ready for deployment, Huguan Third District seized the opportunity to organize all forces to complete the land measurement work. Because they adopted the method of not using landowners' accounts and letting the peasants do it themselves, hidden land belonging to landowners was discovered during the land measurement. For example, in Changjia Pond, six mu of hidden land belonging to relatives of landowners was discovered; in Jin Village, 33.1 mu of land bought by landowners was discovered (including six mu of rented land). The peasants immediately launched a struggle to recover the land. (Zhi Xian)

　　壶关三区丈地中查出地主隐蔽地
    【本报讯】壶关三区在担架回村待命出动的空隙中，抓紧机会，组织全力完成丈地工作，丈地中由于采取了不用地主记帐，农民自己动手的办法，又查出地主隐藏的土地，如常家池查出地主亲戚家隐蔽地六亩；晋庄查出地主买地三十三亩一分（内有租地六亩），农民当即展开斗争收回土地。（志献）
