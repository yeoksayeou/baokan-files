[This report from the Taiyue Front, dated the 10th] The Pingyao Militia Heroes' Gathering reviewed militia tactics. First, Director Wu Lu of the County Armed Forces spoke: "From January to June of last year, the tactical bias was to adopt head-on tactics, insisting on confronting the enemy regardless of the actual situation. From July to October, due to the transfer of our main force and the enemy's concentrated attack, the militia fell into an extremely difficult situation. At that time, Pei Defu's explosions were very well done, but unfortunately, the leadership did not promote them in a timely manner. After November, there have been some changes in tactics, concentrating efforts to carry out explosions. Comrades Pei Defu, Tian Yong, Wu Yong, and others organized flying demolition teams, moving from the Fourth District to the Third and Fifth Districts, influencing the entire county, killing seventy-six enemies in two months. This achievement and experience is valuable. In the future, we must take the explosions at Changze Village as the direction, with every militiaman participating in explosions, and adopt more tactics such as sniping and 'Black Tiger Digs the Heart.' To do well in tactics, we must carefully judge the enemy's situation, listen to the opinions of the masses, conduct careful reconnaissance, and strictly maintain secrecy." Then everyone started a discussion. Pei Defu said: "Explosions are a very profitable business. Setting up a mine is like opening a shop; when a customer comes, you can make money. We must overcome the view of underestimating mines."

　　平遥民兵英雄集会检讨战术
    打破轻视地雷观点
    集中力量开展爆炸
    【本报太岳十日电】平遥民兵英雄集会，检讨民兵战术。首由县武芦主任发言：“去年一月至六月战术上的偏向是采取顶牛战术，不管实际情况，非要顶住敌人不行。七月至十月由于我主力转移，敌人集中兵力进攻，民兵陷入极其困难的局面。当时裴德富的爆炸是搞得很好，可惜领导上没有及时发扬。十一月以后，在战术上有些改变，集中力量开展爆炸。裴德富，田勇、武勇等同志组织了飞行爆炸队，由四区到三区、五区而影响全县，两月中炸死敌人七十六名。这种成绩与经验是宝贵的。今后要以常则村的爆炸为方向，每个民兵都参加爆炸，并要多多采用冷枪、黑虎掏心等战术。要在战术上搞好，必须精细的判断敌情，听取群众意见，细密侦察，严守秘密。接着大家开展讨论。裴德富说：“爆炸是一本万利的生意，按好雷后，好比开店，客人来了，就能赚钱。必须克服轻视雷的观点。”
