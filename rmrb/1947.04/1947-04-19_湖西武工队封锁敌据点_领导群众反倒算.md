　　Huxi Armed Work Team Blockades Enemy Strongholds; Leads Masses in Reversing Land Reform
　　[Our newspaper, Ji-Lu-Yu, 17th dispatch] From the first day the Fifth Army of Chiang Kai-shek invaded Shanxian County, the Huxi First Armed Work Team has been active on the Shan (County)-Shuang (shan) highway. Each day, in groups, they penetrate the vicinity of the Chiang army strongholds in Haozhuang and Longwangmiao, Shanxian County, to prevent them from going out to loot. Under the strict blockade of the armed work team, the enemy dares not venture out easily. On the dark night of the 16th, the armed work team members quietly stepped into the deer enclosure of Chiang army soldier Chen ×, cut the telephone line that the Chiang army had just erected less than three hours before, and compiled the materials they had obtained from the Fifth Army soldiers into leaflets aimed at speaking to the Fifth Army soldiers, posting them on the trees and walls inside the deer enclosure. After the enemy sentries discovered this, they cleverly moved to another place, and the leaflets spread to the trees on both sides of the road and under the clods of earth. Under the large-scale attack of the Chiang army, each member must actively make contributions in battle, and each person must publicize to at least three people every day. At present, the armed work team has penetrated into the border areas and both sides of the highway, dividing into two to three groups each day to help the masses carry out the reversal of land reform. Comrades with higher cultural levels have also included reporting work in their plans for making contributions, and have organized a communications team. From the Fifth Army's attack to the 23rd of last month, they have written nine articles in eleven days.

　　湖西武工队封锁敌据点
    领导群众反倒算
    【本报冀鲁豫十七日电】湖西第一武工队从蒋第五军侵占单县第一天起，即活动于单（县）双（山）公路上。每日以小组为单位，深入单县郝庄、龙王庙蒋军据点周围，阻其外出抢掠。在武工队严密封锁下，敌人不敢轻易外出。十六日漆黑的夜里，武工队员轻轻地踏到陈×蒋军的鹿寨内，把蒋军刚架好还不到三小时的电话线割去，又把自己从五军士兵口中所得的材料，编写成针对五军士兵讲话的传单，贴到鹿寨内的树木、墙壁上。此处敌人哨兵发觉后，又机智的转到另一处去，传单遍及公路两旁的树上及土块底下。在蒋军大举进攻下，每个队员要在战斗中积极立功，且每日至少要宣传三个人，现武工队已深入边沿区及公路两侧，每日分二至三组，帮助群众进行反倒算。文化较高的同志，把报导工作也列入了自己的立功计划内，并组织了通讯小组，自五军进攻至上月二十三日，十一天中，已写稿九件。
