    The Chiang Army's Defense Line in Northern Henan is Shattered
    Our Army Advances and Retreats Freely and is More Proactive
    [Dispatch from the Northern Henan Front, April 21st, by our correspondent Qi Yu] Our correspondent Qi Yu commented on the situation in Northern Henan: Following the annihilation of over 10,000 puppet bandits under the command of Cheng Daosheng, Si Huasheng, Hu Quanlu, and others who had entrenched themselves in Northern Henan for over ten years in early April, the People's Liberation Army launched an attack on the night of April 16th. By the morning of April 18th, after 30 hours of intense fighting, they annihilated another two or more brigades, totaling over 13,700 men, from the Chiang army's 49th Brigade (Second Rapid Column), 66th Division, 47th Division, and parts of the 40th Division under the command of Wang Zhonglian. The People's Liberation Army then capitalized on their victory and, in a single day on April 19th, recovered the three county seats of Junxian, Huaxian, and Qixian, as well as the important town of Daokou. This series of victories not only deprived Chiang Kai-shek of the puppet bandits whom he had inherited from the enemy and puppets, who served as tools for slaughtering the people and expanding occupied territories in Northern Henan, and who possessed considerable numbers and strength, but also deprived him of the main forces of the 49th Brigade (Second Rapid Column) and the 66th Division, which was transferred north from Central China, which he believed could be used as vanguards. This not only caused the Chiang-puppet army to lose surface occupation on the Pinghan Line in Northern Henan, but also shattered the line of defense, leaving the Chiang-puppet army in Anyang and Tangyin isolated and helpless, completely cutting off their ground contact with Wang Zhonglian, and trapping them there like turtles in a jar. Wang Zhonglian attempted to relieve the siege of Tangyin twice, but never succeeded, and his hopes will eventually be completely dashed. Therefore, the position of the Chiang Kai-shek army in Northern Henan has become even more passive. At this moment, the Chiang-puppet army in Northern Henan can only retreat south to garrison the blockhouses in Jixian, Xinxiang, and the Yellow River bridgehead. As for the Chiang army's plan to rely on the Northern Henan base north of the Yellow River to open up the Pinghan Line, that is hard to imagine. On the contrary, the People's Liberation Army in Northern Henan, having liberated a vast area of hundreds of miles, stretching from under the walls of Tangyin in the north to Jixian in the south, from the foothills of the Taihang Mountains in the west to the banks of the Wei River in the east, and from the northwest to the banks of the Zhang River, will gain greater freedom and initiative in Northern Henan to further annihilate the Chiang-puppet army in Northern Henan.

    豫北蒋军防线支离破碎
    我军进退自如更加主动
    【本报豫北前线二十一日电】本报记者齐语评论豫北战局称：豫北人民解放军继四月上旬歼灭盘踞豫北十年以上之伪匪程道生、司华生、扈全禄等部一万余人之后，四月十六日夜半出击，至十八日晨，经过三十小时的激烈战斗，又歼灭了蒋军王仲廉所指挥的四十九旅（第二快速纵队）、六十六师、四十七师及四十师各一部，共两个多旅，一万三千七百余人。人民解放军复乘胜在十九日一天之内收复了浚县、滑县、淇县三座县城及道口等重镇。这一连串的胜利，不但使蒋介石丧失了从敌伪手中接受过来的、作为在豫北残杀人民、扩张占领地而具相当数量并有相当力量的爪牙伪匪，而且丧失了自以为可以作为打先锋用的四十九旅（第二快速纵队）及其从中原赶调北来的六十六师等部主力一部，不仅使蒋伪军在豫北平汉线上失去了面的占领，而且线的防守亦成支离破碎状态，使安阳、汤阴的蒋伪军孤守无援，完全隔断了地面上与王仲廉的联系，而孤伶伶地困守在那里，犹如瓮中之鳖。王仲廉企图两次解汤阴之围，始终没有达到目的，最后将要完全变成幻想。因此，蒋介石军在豫北的地位已更加被动。此刻豫北蒋伪军只南去孤守汲县、新乡及黄河桥头等地的碉堡，至于蒋军企图依托黄河以北豫北基地向北打通平汉线的计划，那是很难想像的事情了。相反的，豫北人民解放军由于北起汤阴城下、南迄汲县、西达太行山麓，东至卫河两岸、西北而至漳河之滨，纵横数百里广大地区重获解放，在豫北将更获得了进退自如，更进一步歼灭豫北蒋伪军的自由和主动。
