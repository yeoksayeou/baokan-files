　　Wuxiang Launches "Farmers United as One" Movement
  　Mobilizes Poor and Hired Peasants to Conduct Thorough Land Investigation
    [This Dispatch from Wuxiang] Wuxiang held an enlarged county-level cadre meeting in the latter part of last month to review the emancipation and policy review, determining to continue in-depth re-investigation. After ten days of discussion, cadres clearly recognized that the current movement had not been carried out deeply enough. In some places, the "backward" elements had not been fully mobilized, feudalism had not been completely eliminated, and many problems still existed in cadre-mass relations. Based on these circumstances, the current policy is to thoroughly investigate land, launch a "Farmers United as One" movement, unite the internal ranks of the peasantry, fully mobilize the poor and hired peasants, and thoroughly eliminate feudalism. According to the development of the movement, the county is divided into three types of villages for specific implementation: The first type, totaling 43, are villages where feudalism has been eliminated, the masses have been mobilized, cadre-mass relations are good, and land reform has been realized. Currently, they should examine the emancipation, carry out conscious education on production, and organize large-scale production, using basic-level general training for peasants to resolve ideological obstacles to production. The second type, totaling 89, are villages where the movement is not thorough enough and should continue to sweep away feudalism, expose air-raid shelters, examine land distribution, launch the "Farmers United as One" movement, and guide peasants to consciously unite and eliminate feudalism. The third type, totaling 51, should mobilize "backward" peasants through general grievance meetings, carry out general training to inspire consciousness, draw clear class boundaries, and thoroughly sweep away feudalism. After the meeting, cadres unanimously recognized that due to certain complacent sentiments in their thinking, the work in recent years had not been able to go deeper. This time, they are determined to overcome complacency, put down their burdens, and delve into the movement so that the county's work can be elevated to a new level. (Joint Office)

　　武乡开展农民一条心运动
  　发动贫雇层深入查田
    【本报武乡讯】武乡于上月下旬举行全县扩大干部会检查翻身检查政策，确定继续深入复查。经过十天讨论、干部明确认识当前运动开展尚不够深入，有些地方“落后”层还未充分发动，封建消灭尚未彻底，干群关系还存在许多问题。根据这些情况，确是当前方针彻底检查土地，开展农民间的一条心运动，团结农民内部，充分发动贫雇层，彻底消灭封建。按运动发展情况，全县分为三类村具体进行：一类村共有四十三个，情况是封建已消灭、群众已发动、干群关系好、土地改革实现的村庄，目前应检查翻身进行生产自觉教育，组织开展大生产。以基层普训农民，解决生产思想障碍。二类村共八十九个，是运动不够彻底，应继续扫清封建，揭防空洞，检查土地分配，开展一条心运动，引导农民自觉团结，消灭封建。三类村共五十一个，以总诉苦发动“落后”农民，进行普训启发自觉，划清阶级界限，以彻底扫清封建。会后干部一致认识因思想上存在着某些自满情绪，致年来工作未能更加深入，这次决心克服自满，放下包袱，深入运动，使全县工作提高一步。（联合办公室）
