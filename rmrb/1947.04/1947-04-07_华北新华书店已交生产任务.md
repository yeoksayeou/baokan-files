　　North China Xinhua Bookstore Completes Production Quota
    [Report from this newspaper] The North China Xinhua Bookstore began submitting its production quota starting on the 17th of last month. According to statistics from various groups, everyone's production during this period exceeded one-quarter of the assigned task. The printing group averaged 60 catties per person, with Chang Shouzhen contributing 80 catties, and Comrade Cheng Bingyu from the General Affairs Section contributing 105 catties. Comrade Zhou Zhiqi from the Sewing Group has already completed four-fifths of the year's task (200 catties). The bookstore has two production methods: one is combined with supply, and the other is combined with operations. Combining with supply involves grinding flour, purchased by the mess hall at slightly lower or equivalent market prices. The organization doesn't buy flour from outside, saving on transportation costs. The Sewing Group makes single-layer clothing for the organization at wages lower than market prices, benefiting both the public and private. Self-transportation is half the cost of hiring local villagers, and can also earn 40 yuan per hour. Other activities, such as sprouting soybeans and grinding tofu, are cheaper than market prices for the same items, not only enabling private production but also improving the mess hall's food. In terms of combining with operations, they are engaged in wood carving, printing manuscripts, and producing portraits of leaders, which enhances their skills in production.

　　华北新华书店已交生产任务
    【本报讯】华北新华书店从上月十七日起开始缴纳生产任务。据各小组统计，这一时期大家生产所得都超过了任务的四分之一。印刷组平均每人交任务六十斤，常守真交了八十斤，总务科组程丙玉同志交了一百零五斤；缝纺组周之奇同志已完成全年五分之四的任务（二百斤）该店的生产方式有两种：一是与供给结合，一是与业务结合，与供给结合是磨面，由伙食上略低于市价或相等于市价收买，机关不向外买面亦节省了运费。缝纺组包作本机关单衣，工资低于市价，作到公私两便。自己运输比雇老乡工资低一半，每个钟头还可赚四十元。其它如生豆芽、磨豆腐，同样的东西比市价便宜，不但私人进行了生产，还改善了伙食。在业务结合方面是刻木刻，印刷稿纸及领袖像，在生产中提高了技术。
