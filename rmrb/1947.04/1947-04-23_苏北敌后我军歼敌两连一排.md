Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 20th: The People's Liberation Army behind enemy lines in Northern Jiangsu, from dawn on the 15th to the 16th, recovered the four strongholds of Huji, Tanggou, Tangjian, and Matun in one fell swoop, cutting off the main supply line of the Chiang army, the Huaiyin-Shuyang highway. It annihilated two companies of the 559th Regiment of the 187th Brigade of the 65th Division of the Chiang army coming to aid from Shuyang City, and two companies and one communications platoon of the 560th Regiment coming to aid from Qianji. A total of over 500 Chiang and puppet troops were killed or wounded, and 130 were captured alive, including Hu Jun, the major battalion commander of the 3rd Battalion of the 560th Regiment. Five 60mm mortars, three grenade launchers, fifteen various machine guns, and over 180 rifles, and ten thousand rounds of ammunition were seized. Although two Chiang planes came to aid during the battle, they could not reverse the fate of the Chiang and puppet troops. The battle was the first major victory since Northern Jiangsu fell to Chiang.
Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 16th: During the Libao campaign, over ten thousand people from the two Tais (Dongtai and Taipei) participated in logistics. Dongtai mobilized over a thousand carrying pole teams and over seven thousand people served with the army. In a certain township of Tangze District in the county, 338 people poured into logistics, and almost all the remaining men, women, old, and young participated in pulling carts and transporting rice. Chang Decai, a stretcher bearer from a certain township in Anfeng District, braved the rain of bullets to rescue the wounded. The terrain was bad, and he could not stand up, so he crawled to the wounded soldier and said: "Comrade, don't worry. No matter what, I will drag you off the front line." Finally, under the firepower that was turning up the soil, he safely rescued the wounded soldier. One farmer carried two wounded soldiers on his back on the battlefield, his cotton shirt and jacket stained with blood. He was very tired when he returned home at night, but the next morning he automatically sent public rice again. A certain township sent over 25,000 jin of rice to the front line in just three or four days. A certain town established a wounded soldier reception station and a慰问 (consolation) group on the main road to take care of the wounded soldiers.

    苏北敌后我军歼敌两连一排
    【新华社华中二十日电】苏北敌后人民解放军，于十五日拂晓至十六日，一举收复胡集、汤沟、汤涧、马屯四据点，打断蒋军主要供应线淮（阴）沭（阳）公路，歼沭阳城来援蒋军六十五师一八七旅五五九团两个连，及钱集来援之五六○团两个连另一个通讯排。共毙伤蒋伪五百余名，生俘五六○团第三营少校营长胡俊以下一百三十名，缴六○炮五门，掷弹筒三个，各式机枪十五挺，步枪一百八十余支，子弹万发。战斗中虽有蒋机两架来援，亦未能挽回蒋伪之覆没命运。战役为苏北转为蒋后以来第一次大捷。
    【新华社华中十六日电】李堡战役中，两台（东台、台北）万余群众，参加后勤，东台出动千余付担架，七千余群众随军服务。该县唐泽区某乡三百三十八人涌入后勤，其余男女老少几乎全部参加拉车运米。安丰区某乡担架队员常德才，冒弹雨抢救伤员，地形不好，无法立起，乃爬到伤员身边说：“同志，放心。无论如何，我也要把你拖下火线。”终于在打得泥土直翻的火力下，安然将伤员救出。一个农民在战场上连驮二个伤员，棉衫小褂子染满了血。夜里回家已甚疲劳，翌晨自动又派送公米。某乡在三、四两日中即将二万五千余斤大米送上前线。某镇在要道成立伤员招待站，慰问小组，看护伤员。
