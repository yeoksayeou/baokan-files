[This article transmitted by the newspaper's office in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region.] A surge of enthusiasm for joining the army is taking place in the Nanfeng districts as each district convenes peasant meetings. The Fourth District has achieved the greatest results. At the close of the meeting, 615 people had signed up; when the new soldiers assembled, another 50 joined, for a total of 665. The peasants in the district arrived at the meeting place the afternoon before, and the district cadres went down to each village, proposing "think about it" and "compare", fermenting a meritorious service competition. The next day, District Chief Li gave an enlightening speech, emphasizing "Oppose Chiang, Protect the Land" and "How to Protect the Land." His speech deeply moved the peasants. Xin Guanghe, a model squad leader from Malaozhuang, took the stage and signed up, saying, "Our village has more than eighty militiamen, and I will lead twenty-six of them to join the army." Then, on behalf of the entire group, he challenged the entire district, and the district called on everyone to learn from Malaozhuang. Sheli Temple was not convinced and wanted to compete with Malaozhuang and Litai Village at the meeting. The representative of Sheli Temple said, "We can't fall behind you." Agricultural Association Chairman Gao Chaoyi signed up a platoon (thirty people). Under their army recruitment competition, an old lady from Malaozhuang took the stage to send her son to join the army. Wang Biai, a model peasant from Huangdikou who won first place in the county after liberation, led nineteen young people to join the army. Under their mutual enlightenment and encouragement, they proposed: "One person joins the army, the whole family is glorious; ten people join the army, the whole village is glorious; collective enlistment adds glory upon glory." After the meeting, the villages that had already signed up were afraid of falling behind, so as soon as the meeting ended, the army recruitment representatives secretly returned to their villages to mobilize. In this way, Malaozhuang increased from 26 to 160, Sheli Temple from 30 to 99, and Hongmiao from 56 to 105. Currently, a mass upsurge of army recruitment has been created throughout the county.
    [This article transmitted by the newspaper's office in the Hebei Southern region.] Liberated peasants in Wuxun villages have enthusiastically launched an upsurge of army recruitment. The masses in Fensai Village proposed, "Everyone is liberated, everyone joins the army." In just one and a half days, sixteen young men signed up. Eight militiamen from Liu Yanglin Village, influenced by squad leader Liu Jixian, signed up for the army at the same time.
    [This article transmitted by the newspaper's office in the Taiyue region.] Encouraged by the victories on the Jinan front, another thousand new soldiers here have rushed to the front lines. More than 150 wounded soldiers from Unit XX also returned to the battlefield ahead of schedule. Before the soldiers left, various units held farewell banquets for them, and the people spontaneously beat gongs and drums to send them off.
