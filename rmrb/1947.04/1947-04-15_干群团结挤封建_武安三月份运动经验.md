　　Cadre-Masses Unity Squeezes Out Feudalism: Experience of the March Movement in Wu'an
　　Ting Dong
　　The Wu'an March "Untie the Knots, One Heart" movement was a large-scale and meticulous solidarity review and solidarity-leveling movement with the adjustment of cadre-people relations as the top priority. The cadre-people relationship is essentially the relationship between the Party and the peasants, the relationship between advanced masses and "backward" masses, the key to further mobilizing the "backward" to let go and go deep, and another major review of the turn-over. After the county held a series of large-scale conferences for 15,254 cadres, new and old activists, and honest farmers in districts and base villages, a new movement was launched in the villages. The main experience is:

　　1.  From the comparison of suffering, the comparison of emancipation, and the realization of fruits, the masses broke down their worries and put forward reasonable demands for thorough emancipation. The leadership resolutely approved, called on the masses to resolve their "knot" mentality, and the branch actively coordinated to support the masses.

　　When mobilizing honest farmers at the beginning, they had "knots in their hearts but not on their lips." Their concerns were: "It's not fair if I don't speak out, but I'm afraid of offending people if I do," "I used to be the one who suffered, and now I'm still the one who suffers," "The credit for overthrowing the landlord goes to the cadres, and what little I have was also given to me by the cadres," "It's useless to say anything, so I won't say anything." In comparing suffering and emancipation, they realized that "peasants suffer together, and should be emancipated the same way," "the fruits are everyone's blood and sweat, and the peasants are the masters of the fruits," "distribution should be reasonable and fair, and every peasant should have a share." At this time, the masses demanded, "If feudalism is not eliminated, the struggle will not stop," "If the obstacles are not leveled, the fruits will not be fully realized," and they boldly put forward their opinions in large quantities.

　　2. Affirm the merits of the cadres, encourage the cadres to lay down their burdens and make more contributions to the people, the leadership gives the cadres sincere help, the masses give the cadres enlightenment and support, the cadres educate the cadres, and promote righteousness.

　　After listening to the criticisms of the masses, the cadres developed "resentment" because of "arrogance," complaining that the masses were ungrateful, complaining that the superiors were ignorant, saying that the masses were "backward" and had no merit, and saying that the superiors were setting a bad example. The masses raised knots, but the cadres had knots. Their thoughts were:

　　(1) "The superiors lead the work, and then the superiors come to find our mistakes. The superiors are always right" - This requires letting the cadres and masses criticize the leaders, the leaders sincerely examine themselves, and share the responsibility. The attitude of the examination should neither be perfunctory nor all-encompassing.

　　(2) "Struggling against landlords means struggling against cadres. Hard work results in becoming a target of struggle. Being a cadre has no good end. Whoever crosses the river first gets their feet wet, and the first tree to stick out rots first" - This requires everyone to examine the cadre policy, evaluate the past cadre problems, and the leadership must clearly state that they love and protect the cadres, and that correcting the cadres' mistakes is to cure diseases and save people, and will never use force (no beating, etc.). After the masses put forward their opinions, they judged them themselves, distinguished between correct opinions, revengeful prejudices, and bad people taking advantage of loopholes, and transformed the temporary anti-cadre sentiment among the masses into a family atmosphere. The cadres realized that the masses loved them, so they should wash their faces. Their cadres work hard all day long in order to unite the masses. If the masses have knots and don't untie them, they cannot be mobilized. It is the glorious task of the cadres to lead the masses to untie their knots, not to struggle against the cadres. If the masses have opinions about the cadres and don't raise them, they are not one family. Cadres who can hear the opinions of the masses have prestige. The masses dare to give the cadres opinions, proving that the cadres do not suppress the masses. If the cadres have shortcomings, the masses will raise them, and the cadres will have a backing and not be afraid of falling into the ditch. Whoever has a black mark cannot fool the masses. Washing your face behind closed doors will not get it clean. Knowing your mistakes and admitting them is not a mistake. Knowing your mistakes and not correcting them is a mistake within a mistake. Give food to the hungry and tell your family what you have to say.

　　(3) "Being a cadre means suffering three kinds of anger: bad work style means suffering anger from the masses, failure to complete tasks means suffering anger from the superiors, and poor production means suffering anger from the family. No one knows our difficulties. We have worked for so many years without merit but with hard work. Have we done everything wrong?" In fact, our village cadres have done a very good job in these difficult circumstances, proving that the cadres have ability and merit. The cadres of Chenjiaping Village summarized the revolutionary merit of the masses in participating in the war and joining the army: "Although we have revolutionary merit, we cannot do without the masses." In the eighth and eleventh districts, after the cadres expressed their merits and made up for their merits, the cadres realized that "the superiors and the masses will not extinguish our merits, so we must correct our mistakes." The righteousness of laying down burdens and making more contributions was promoted. The cadres realized that merit is eternal, shortcomings are temporary, and shortcomings in merit cannot cover up merit. Washing your face is adding merit to merit.

　　(4) Honest farmers wash my face, and I sincerely accept it. What if sharp-headed bad people take advantage of loopholes? Bad people can take advantage of loopholes because we have black marks. Washing our faces is to fill in the loopholes so that bad people cannot take advantage of them again. If we are afraid of loopholes, we will not let the masses express their opinions, and bad people will be able to take advantage of loopholes even more. Untying the knots unites the masses even more, which can crack down on the activities of bad people. Washing your face is conscious, and untying the knots is our leadership. As long as there is true democracy, we are not afraid of bad people. The masses are the fairest, and the cadres can rest assured.

　　3. After the cadres make self-criticism to the masses, they should withdraw while it is hot and gain more fruits. The cadres wash their faces, the masses approve, the masses appraise the cadres, and the cadres evaluate their merits.

　　The masses did not believe that the cadres could accept criticism and correct themselves at the beginning. When the cadres sincerely examine themselves and withdraw the gains, the enthusiasm of the masses is even higher, and they will naturally appraise the cadres and evaluate their merits. The masses discussed what a good cadre is, and encouraged the good cadres who have never been detached from the masses, distinguished that peaceful cadres who do not cause trouble are not good cadres, resolutely struggled against those who have temporary shortcomings but are not bad cadres, reviewed the history and merits of the cadres and gave them credit, and better united around the cadres.

　　Finally, at the solidarity conference, the cadres and the masses "talked about their innermost feelings" (turning two fears into two smiles), "expressed their attitudes" (loving the people and respecting the cadres), "countered sabotage" (striking down the counter-attack activities that attempted to sow discord between the cadres and the masses and attack the cadres), "compared progress" (the cadres will do a better job in the future, and the masses will also examine their backwardness), made plans to establish merit, launched a cadre-masses merit movement, squeezed out feudalism and checked the leveling. The masses also encouraged the individually adjusted cadres, called on them to work hard and strive to be elected in the future. The slogan raised by the Third District in the solidarity movement was "Untying knots is not about starting struggles, everyone relax, whoever has knots must untie them, untie them with one heart, for the sake of leveling and making up for the gaps, and living a good life together. Cadres and masses are one family, all for the revolution. The tails of feudalism and backward roots must be swept away, so that special agents and landlords cannot take advantage of our loopholes."

　　4. The following must be clarified in the movement guidance: 1. Cadres and masses should be mobilized at the same time, based on the two consciousnesses. 2. There must be a leading group including upright members of all parties, and new activists should be used in large numbers. 3. It should not be confused with sectarian contradictions. 4. The branch must be mobilized to lead, and the branch must be improved through the movement. 5. The leadership educates the masses, the masses educate the leadership, and all county and district cadres learn in the movement, listen to the criticisms of the masses, and play a exemplary role in transforming their work style and withdrawing the gains.

　　干群团结挤封建
    武安三月份运动经验
    庭栋
    武安三月份的解疙瘩一条心运动，是以调整干民关系为首的大规模而细致的团结复查，团结填平运动。干民关系实质上是党与农民的关系、先进群众与“落后”群众的关系问题，是进一步发动“落后”放手深入的关键问题，也是又一次的翻身大检查。全县在区和基点村召开了一万五千二百五十四人的干部新老积极分子老实农民一揽子大会后，村上即掀起了新的运动。主是经验是：
    一、从比痛苦比翻身和果实自觉中，群众打破顾虑，提出彻底翻身的合理要求，领导上坚决批准，号召群众解疙瘩决心病，支部积极串通，给群众撑腰。
    开始发动老实农民时，他们“肚里有疙瘩，嘴上没疙瘩”。他们的顾虑是“不说出来心不平，说出来又怕得罪人”，“过去是受屈人，现在还当受屈人”，“斗倒地主是干部的功，东西不多也是干部给咱的”，“说了不算就不吭”。在比痛苦比翻身中自觉到“农民一同受穷，应当一样翻身”，“果实是大家的血汗，农民是果实的主人”，“分配应当合理公平，农民都有一份”。这时群众就要求“封建不消灭，斗争不停止”，“圪道填不平，果实不到底”，就大胆大量的提出自己的意见。
    二、肯定干部的功劳，鼓励干部放下包袱，更多的为人民立功，领导上给干部以真诚帮助，群众给干部以启发撑腰，干部教育干部，发扬正气。
    干部听了群众的批评后，就因“骄气”而产生“怨气”，怨群众反脸无情，怨上级眼睛不明，说群众“落后”无功，说上级上梁不正，群众提了疙瘩，干部却有了疙瘩他们的思想是：
    （１）“上级领导着干，上级又来找咱错，上级常有理”——这就要放手让干群批评领导，领导上诚恳检讨，分担责任，检讨的态度既不能支应门面，也不可一统包揽。
    （２）斗争地主斗干部，辛辛苦苦工作，落下个斗争对象，当干部没有好下场，谁先过河谁先湿足，出头木先烂”，——这就要大家检讨干部政策，评判认识过去的干部问题，领导上肯定说明爱护干部，对干部错误是治病救人，决不动武（不能吊打等）。群众提了意见后，就自己评断，区别正确意见，报复成见与坏人钻空，变群众中一时的反干部情绪为一家人的空气。干部体会到群众对咱的爱护，咱就应当洗脸，咱们干部整天辛苦，就为了团结群众，群众有疙瘩不解，就不能发动，领导群众解疙瘩是干部的光荣任务，不是斗争干部，群众对干部有意见不提，就不是一家人，能听到群众意见的干部，才是有威信，群众敢给干部提意见，证明干部不压制群众，干部有缺点群众提，咱干部就有了靠山，不怕掉到沟里，谁有黑也哄不了群众，关住门洗脸洗不净，知错认错不算错，知错不改错中错，有饭送给饥人，有话说给亲人。
    （３）“当干部三受气：作风不好受群众气，任务完不成受上级气，生产不好受家庭气，咱的困难没有人知道，工作多少年没功劳也有苦劳，我们干的都错了吗？”其实我们的村干部在这多困难中工作作的很好，证明干部有能力有功劳。陈家坪村干部总结参战参军中，认识了群众的革命功劳“咱虽革命有功，没有群众还不行”。八区和十一区，干部表功补功后，干部自觉到“上级和群众都不灭咱的功劳，那咱可得改错误才行。”放下包袱更多立功的正气发扬起来，干部认识了功劳是永远的，缺点是一时的，功劳中的缺点遮不了功劳，洗脸是功上加功。
    （四）老实农民给我洗脸，我诚心接受，尖头坏人钻了空子怎办？坏人能钻空，是因为咱有黑，洗脸为了补空子不叫坏人再利用，怕钻空就不让群众提意见则坏人越能钻空子，解了疙瘩更多团结了群众，就能打破坏人活动，洗脸是自觉的，解疙瘩是咱领导的，只要真民主，就不怕有坏人，群众最公平，干部放宽心。
    三、干部向群众作自我批评后，趁热退出多得果实，干部洗脸，群众批准，群众鉴定干部，经干部评功。
    群众开始不相信干部能接受批评改正，缺点当干部诚恳检讨，退出多得果实后，群众热情更高，自然会经干部鉴定评功，群众讨论什么是好干部，就鼓励了一贯不脱离群众的好干部，区别了不惹人的和平干部不是好干部，坚决斗争有一时缺点的不是坏干部，检查干部的历史与功绩给干部记功，更好的团结在干部的周围。
    最后在团结大会上，干部群众互相“谈心事”（由两个怕变成两个笑）、“表态度”（爱民尊干），“反破坏”（把挑拨干群关系企图打击干部的反攻活动打下去），“比进步”（干部今后更好好干，群众也检讨自己的落后面），订立功计划，展开干群立功运动，挤封建查填平。对个别调整的干部，群众也给以鼓励，号召他们埋头苦干，以后当选。三区在团结运动中提的口号是“解疙瘩不是起斗争，大家放宽心，谁有疙瘩都要解，解开了一条心，为的填平和补齐，同过好光景。干部群众一家人，都是为革命，封建尾巴落后根都要扫除清，不让特务和地主钻了咱的空。”
    四、在运动指导上必须明确：一、干群同时发动，在两个自觉的基础上进行。二、要有一个包括各方面正派分子的领导集团，大量运用新积极分子。三、不能与宗派矛盾混淆。四、必须发动支部来领导，经过运动提高支部。五、领导教育群众，群众教育领导，全体县区干部在运动中学习，倾听群众批评，在改造作风与退出多得果实中起模范作用。
