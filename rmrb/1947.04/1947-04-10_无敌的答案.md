　　The Invincible Answer
　　Wang Minzhao
　　The battle was over, and the troops returned, escorting the prisoners and spoils of war.

　　Among a group of prisoners, a heavy machine gun squad leader told us about his capture:

　　"You are really fierce, breaking through five lines of obstacles. Especially that spirited young fellow, I saw with my own eyes that he was already wounded, but he still charged forward. Even the continuous fire of the heavy machine gun couldn't stop him. Like a tiger descending from the mountain, he pounced and grabbed the legs of my heavy machine gun. I saw that his cotton uniform was soaked with blood, but he still had so much strength..."

　　He took a breath: "We had no choice but to be captured. He snatched the heavy machine gun away and was carried away on a stretcher."

　　After a while, he repeated: "You are invincible."

　　×　 ×　 ×

　　The next day, we received the tragic news from the hospital that our young hero, Comrade Yan Qianxiang, had gloriously sacrificed himself due to excessive blood loss. He left no belongings, only a Party membership application form carefully wrapped in four layers of newspaper. The blood had soaked through all four layers of newspaper. The four corners of the application and the folded areas were stained with blood, especially the right side of the middle fold, where the blood was particularly heavy. Although it wasn't as red as a signed fingerprint, it was much thicker than that crimson fingerprint, to the point where it obscured the part of the application written in blue ink about his family situation.

　　In the areas without bloodstains, it could be seen that he was from Nanhouyu Village, Pingding, Shanxi Province, twenty-three years old, a former auto worker who had only been allocated six mu of land after the victory against Japan and didn't even own a house. He voluntarily joined the army in November 1945. Regarding his views on the current political situation, he wrote in his application: "If the Kuomintang reactionaries dare to attack our liberated areas, we will concentrate our forces and resolutely eliminate them."

　　The branch's evaluation of him was: politically loyal and reliable, brave, proactive, able to unite people. He also wrote in his application: "... unwavering, uncompromising, unafraid of sacrifice, fighting to the end for the cause of the proletariat and the people." Below these words, he had pressed a bright red fingerprint. Now, this passage on the application form before us is no longer just written in ink. Comrade Yan Qianxiang has engraved it onto the glorious monument of the Chinese people's cause with the last drop of his own lifeblood.

　　The regimental political commissar used this blood-stained Party membership application form to educate the entire unit, calling on everyone to avenge Comrade Yan Qianxiang.

　　Proletarian, auto worker, young Communist Party member, I thought again of the captured heavy machine gun squad leader's words, "You are invincible." Yes, we are invincible, this is the invincible answer. (Attached picture)

　　无敌的答案
    王敏昭
    战斗解决了，部队押着俘虏和胜利品转回来。
    在一群俘虏中，有一个重机枪班长告诉我们关于他被俘的经过：
    “你们真猛，连冲破五道障碍，特别是一个精悍的青年小伙子，我亲眼见他已经负伤了，但他还是死冲，重机枪的连发也阻挡不了他，像下山猛虎一样，一扑过来就拉住我的重机枪腿。我看他血都浸湿了棉衣，还是那样大的劲………。”
    他转了一口气：“我们只有被俘了，他把重机枪夺过来，也被抬上担架走了”。
    停了一会，他重复的说：“你们是无敌的”。
　      ×　    ×　      ×
    第二天，从医院传来悲痛的消息，我们的青年英雄阎千祥同志因流血过多而光荣牺牲了，他身上没有留下任何遗物，只有一张用四层报纸包得好好的入党志愿书，血已经将四层报纸都浸透，志愿书的四个角以及折过的地方都染上了血迹，特别是当中折过的右方，血特别重。虽然没有表上签字的手印那样红，却比那朱红的指纹浓得多，以至把用蓝墨水写在志愿书上关于他家庭状况那部分的字都盖得看不清楚了。
    在没有血迹的地方，可以看出来：他是山西平定南后峪村人，二十三岁，汽车工人出身，抗战胜利后才分得六亩地，房子也没有一间。他是一九四五年十一月自动入伍的，对于目前政治形势的意见，他在志愿书上写着：“如果国民党反动派敢来进攻我们解放区，我们就要集中力量坚决消灭他”。
    支部对他的评语是：政治上忠实可靠、勇敢、积极吃苦，能团结人。他在志愿书上还写着：“………不动摇、不妥协、不怕牺牲，为无产阶级与人民事业奋斗到底”。在这几句话下边按上了鲜红的手印。现在在我们面前摆着的志愿书的这段话，已经不是墨写的了，阎千祥同志已经用他自己生命的最后一滴血把它刻到中国人民事业的光荣功劳大碑上去了。
    团政委把这张血染的入党志愿书教育全体部队，号召大家为阎千祥同志报仇。
    无产者，汽车工人，青年共产党员，我又想起了俘虏重机枪班长的话，“你们是无敌的”。是的，我们是无敌的，这就是无敌的答案。（附图片）
