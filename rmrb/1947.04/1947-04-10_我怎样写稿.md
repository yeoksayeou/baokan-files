　　How I Write Articles
    Li Wenbo
    I love reading newspapers, especially combat dispatches, news stories, and articles about work in the troops; they are particularly close to me. I often get the feeling when I read some articles, "We have that too!" but I don't dare to write, because I am dominated by two thoughts: one is, "There are so many correspondents! Would anyone notice us?" and the other is, "My education level is low, I'd be embarrassed if I didn't write well!" Later, education cadre Comrade Fa Sheng forced me to write a little story, "The Eighth Route Army is Strong and Kind," which was serialized twice, and that gave me courage. But then two more thoughts arose: first, I was afraid people would say I was showing off, and second, as a battalion commander, I was afraid that the person being written about would become arrogant. So I didn't dare to write again. I thought, "I'll just praise him a little, why write anything?!" After the battle of Shaoerzhai, there were many heroic models with heroic stories, but when I wanted to praise them, those comrades were no longer there. That's when I wrote "Blood on the Sleeve" and "Fifty-Nine Wounded," and they were published again. The newspaper even sent a letter encouraging me, and that's when my courage really picked up, and I started collecting material for writing everywhere. At this point, another problem arose: this wasn't vivid enough, that wasn't worth writing about. I put in a lot of effort to collect material, but I had nothing to write about. Later, I participated in the Battle of Wanglou, and many comrades reported their merits to me on the battlefield and asked me to report them. Taking this opportunity, I wrote "The Third Battalion in the Battle of Wanglou." Later, during the ten-day siege of Jinxiang, I wrote "What I Saw Under the City." After these articles were published, the company discussed them, and they thought they were very realistic. Many comrades said, "As long as it's reported, we'll be happy even without a reward." From this, I gained an experience, which is, "Writing doesn't necessarily have to be perfect." Since then, my enthusiasm for writing has increased unprecedentedly. I further realized that writing shouldn't just be about praising people, but it's also my responsibility, a good way for me to learn from the masses. But now there's another problem that hasn't been solved yet: "There are materials everywhere, everything should be written." As a result, I can't write anything. What should I do?

　　我怎样写稿
    李文波
    我是最爱看报的，特别那些战斗通讯、新闻故事、部队工作一类的文章更是亲密。往往看到一些文章发生一种“这是我们也有哇”的想法，就是不敢写，这是有两个思想支配着，一个是：“通讯员多着呢！能看起咱了吗？”另一个是：“文化程度低，写不好多丢人哪！？”后来，教育干事法生同志逼着我写了个“八路军人强心好”小故事，连载了两次，鼓起了我的勇气，可是又发生了两个想法，一、是怕人家说出风头，二、咱是营长怕被写的人骄傲了。于是又不敢写了。心里想：“我表扬他一下算了，还写什么呢？！”打完了邵耳寨，有很多英勇故事的模范人物，想表扬吧，那些同志又不在了。这才写的《袄袖上的血》和《五十九个负伤的》，结果又刊出了，报社还来信鼓励了我，这下勇气才提起来了，便到处收集写稿材料。这会又出了毛病，就是这个也不生动，那个也不值得写，下工夫收集材料倒没得写了。后来我参加了王楼战斗，有好多同志在战场上向我报功，并要求给他上报，趁这个机会我写了“王楼战斗第三营”。后来，围困金乡十几天，写了“城下见闻”。这些稿子载出以后，连里讨论了一下，他们认为很真实，好多同志说：“只要给上报，不给奖品也高兴”。从这里我得到了一个经验，那就是，“写稿不一定非成一套才行。”自此我写稿的情绪空前提高了。进而知道写稿不该是光为表扬人，而是自己的责任，自己向群众学习的一个好方法。可是这会又有了问题，至今还没有解决。就是：“到处是材料，什么都该写。”结果是什么也写不成，这该怎么办呢？
