Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, April 11th: Crisis and terror rule Changchun. According to a dispatch from United Press reporter Roderick on March 2nd, Changchun is filled with war rumors and the terror of executions for arbitrary price hikes. Changchun has been cut off from the outside world, and recently no one except government officials has been allowed to pass through. Martial law is announced at 5 p.m. every evening, prohibiting pedestrians in an attempt to eradicate "suspicious Communist underground activities." A businessman was charged with being a "member of a Communist transportation cooperative" and publicly executed on March 4th.

Because of strict restrictions on transactions and soaring prices, the black market is openly rampant. The city government attempted to "ration" coal, but after rationing ten kilograms of coal to each household, the "rationing bureau" dissolved, claiming it could not solve the coal shortage.

The highest price limit for sorghum rice was announced, starting at 18 Northeast yuan per pound (one yuan equals 200 Chiang currency), but the shortage of food caused the price of rice to rise to 21 yuan within a few days, and the black market price reached 80 yuan.

Changchun's factories are desolate, with only broken bricks and rubble remaining. There is no industry to speak of. There are mainly a few small shops, but under the impact of the war, unemployment and the continuous rise in living costs have led to economic depression and increasing chaos.

Chiang's Mayor Zhao Junmai has repeatedly adopted military suppression measures in an attempt to salvage this crisis. The military authorities turn a blind eye to the needs of the citizens and the desperate situation they face.

Changchun lacks nothing in one aspect: violence.

　　危机与恐怖充满蒋管区
    只有暴力没有粮食
    长春面临绝境
    【新华社陕北十一日电】危机与恐怖统治着长春。据美联社记者罗德利克三月二日通讯称：长春充满了战争谣言和因任意抬高物价而被处死的恐怖。长春已与外界隔绝，最近除了政府官员外，不许任何人通过。每晚五点，宣布戒严，禁绝行人，企图根绝“可疑的共产党的地下活动。”一个商人被加以“共产党运输合作社社员”的罪名，于三月四日公然处死。
    因为严格限制交易与物价飞涨，黑市公开盛行。市政府企图“配给”煤炭，但在每家配给十公斤煤以后，“配给局”以无法解决煤荒即告解散。
    高粱米限价最高额公布了，开始每磅十八元东北流通券（一元等于蒋币二百元），食粮缺乏，使米价几天内涨至二十一元，黑市竟至八十元。
    长春工厂荒芜，仅存破砖残瓦，无任何工业可言。主要是几家小型商店，现在在战争影响下，失业与生活费的不断高涨，使经济萧条，日陷紊乱。
    蒋记市长赵君迈屡采用军事压迫办法，以图挽救此种危机。市民的需要与他们所面临的绝境，军事当局熟视无睹。
    长春只有一项不缺乏，那就是暴力。
