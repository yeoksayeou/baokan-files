　　Introduction to the Production Organization Structure of Houchi Village
    Feng Ziqin
    Houchi Village in She County experienced a vibrant production campaign last year, and began to reorganize mutual aid groups after the new year. It was discovered that in last year's production, mutual aid groups were mixed with other miscellaneous administrative tasks, such as assigning errands and shouldering meeting burdens, all handled by the head of the large mutual aid group, who was too busy. During the mutual aid reorganization, no one wanted to be the head of the large group. After discussion, it was reorganized into a unified leadership, unified organization, division of labor, and a combination of war and production organizational form. All 225 households in the village voluntarily formed nine large groups.

    The organizational structure of the large group includes a large group leader responsible for leading production; a self-study group leader responsible for leading the militia group's martial arts training within the group; a study group leader responsible for leading the mutual aid school (established by mutual aid groups) to study culture; a porter team leader responsible for the group's war participation, supporting errands, stretcher bearing, and substitute farming; a livestock team leader responsible for assigning livestock errands, and coordinating with the porter team leader to coordinate the group's labor and livestock with the large group leader; a clerk responsible for supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of soldiers and martyrs; and a life group leader responsible for buying lamp oil and lighting lamps at the mutual aid school at night. The collection of public grain and funds is the responsibility of the neighborhood chief and the head of the lane, and has nothing to do with the mutual aid group. The whole group has unified leadership and division of labor. Various tasks are combined within the group at any time, which is convenient and flexible. The leaders of each system collect materials from their respective systems and report to their respective systems. Administratively, they cannot arbitrarily convene meetings of large group leaders or assign tasks. The large group is divided into two to three small groups, led by a small group leader. Various tasks such as self-study and learning are led and promoted by model and active members of various tasks within the large group.

    Each large group has the total number of labor and livestock. The anti-requisition director assigns errands according to the number of laborers in each large group. Errands are not assigned to households or individuals. The large group can mutually assist and exchange labor with the errand tickets and work points within the group. With participation in the war at the front and production at the rear, the whole village is laying the foundation for the combination of war and production with 225 households.

    The village has a production committee to lead the production of the entire village. The production committee is composed of the production director, village head, political director, farmers' association director, women's federation director, cooperative manager, and three cadres from the labor mutual aid society. The large group leaders are led by the production committee, and the production committee cadres are in turn led by the large group leaders within the group. The labor mutual aid society is directly under the production committee and has a manager, accountant, and three coordinating committee members. The manager is responsible for coordinating excellent varieties, the coordinating committee members are responsible for coordinating the labor and livestock of the entire village, and the accountant is responsible for registering numerical accounts. The large-scale production movement has now begun in the entire village.

　　后池村生产组织机构介绍
    冯子钦
    涉县后池村，去年生产运动搞的热火朝天，今年过年后即着手整顿互助。发现在去年生产中，互助组和其它差务行政等工作混在一起，一切派差，开会负担……等都是互助组大组长负责，忙不过来，整顿互助时，谁也不愿当大组长。经过大家研究，现改组为：统一领导、统一组织、分工负责、战争和生产结合的组织形式。全村二百二十五户自愿结合了九个大组。
    大组的组织机构，有大组长负责领导生产；自学组长负责领导本大组内民兵小组练武；学习组长领导互助学校（以互助组成立的民校）学习文化；民夫班长负责本大组参战、支差、担架、代耕等工作；畜力班长负责派牲口差，和民夫班长联系，商同大组长调剂全组劳畜力；干事一人负责拥军、优抗等工作；生活组长负责买灯油，晚上到互助学校点灯等事务工作。收公粮公款归闾、邻长，和互助组没关系。全组统一领导分工负责，各种工作在组内随时结合，方便灵活，各系统组长收集各系统材料，到各系统汇报工作，行政上不能随意召集大组长开会或分配任务。大组内分两个到三个小组，小组由小组长领导。自学、学习等各种工作由大组内各种工作的模范、积极分子带头推动。
    各大组有全组劳畜力的总数，抗勤主任按各大组的劳力数派差。不派给户或个人，大组有差票工票在组内互助变工，前方参战后方生产，全村由二百二十五户，打下战争和生产结合的基础。
    村上有生产委员会领导全村生产，生产委员会由生产主任、村长、政治主任、农会主任、妇救主任、合作社经理及劳动互助社三个干部参加。大组长受生产委员会领导，生产委员会干部在组内又受大组长领导，劳动互助社直属生产委员会，有经理、会计、调剂委员三人。经理负责调剂优良品种，调剂委员负责调剂全村劳畜力，会计管登记数字账目，现全村已开始大生产运动。
