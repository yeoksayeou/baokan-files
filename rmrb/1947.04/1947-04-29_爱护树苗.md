　　Protect Seedlings
　　On April 8th, I went from Suǒbǎo to Wēn Village to see a play and saw more than ten seedlings planted along the road pulled up and thrown aside, and some were shaken loose. I propose that everyone, regardless of gender, age, or size, should have the responsibility to protect seedlings. In particular, the local responsible comrades should widely publicize education and protect the seedlings well; otherwise, planting trees with one hand and destroying trees with the other, planting trees every year and never growing trees, is not only useless, but also wasteful!

　　爱护树苗
    四月八日我从索堡到温村看戏，见到沿路上栽的树苗，拔起十余株扔在一旁，有的又被摇动活了。我提议每个人不论男女老少大人小孩都应有爱护树苗的责任。尤其是当地的负责同志应广泛宣传教育好好保护树苗；不然一手种树，一手毁树，年年植树，年年长不起树，不仅无益，而且浪费！
