　　South Manchuria Democratic Allied Army Achieves a Great Victory in Counterattack
  　8,000 American-Equipped Chiang Soldiers Captured
  　The Entire 89th Division and Another Regiment Annihilated
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, Urgent Telegram, 5th] Following the second great victory of the self-defense counterattack south of the Songhua River, the South Manchuria Democratic Allied Army has achieved another triumph, completely annihilating the American-equipped Chiang army’s 13th Army, 89th Division, and the 162nd Regiment of the 54th Division, totaling one division and one regiment. They also completely routed two regiments of the 93rd Army’s Provisional 20th Division and remnants of the 60th Army’s 184th Division. Chiang Kai-shek's loyal running dog, Du Yuming, disregarding the heavy losses of over 12,500 men suffered last month north of the Songhua River in North Manchuria, and the previous three offensives in the Linjiang area where over 10,400 men were lost, once again at the end of last month in the Qingyuan and Xinbin area, gathered the repeatedly battered New 6th Army, the entirety of the 52nd Army, and the majority of the 60th Army, along with parts of the 13th Army and the 93rd Army transferred from Rehe, a total of five divisions, and at the beginning of this month launched a fourth fierce attack against our Liaodong Military Region in three routes. The northern route of the attacking Chiang army advanced along the Ji (Lin) Mei (River Mouth) Railway towards Huinan and Liuhe. The southern route of the attacking Chiang army confronted our Democratic Allied Army across the Hun River in the suburbs of Huanren City. The central route, with the 89th Division of the 13th Army, a part of the 54th Division, and other units totaling two full divisions as the main force, advanced towards Honglazi and Youfangjie, south of Liuhe, on the 2nd. They were immediately surrounded by the Democratic Allied Army, and from 6:00 AM on the 3rd, after ten hours of fierce fighting, by 4:00 PM, the entire 89th Division and the entire 162nd Regiment of the 54th Division were annihilated, and the Provisional 20th Division of the 93rd Army and the remnants of the 184th Division of the 60th Army, which had advanced to Ankou Town, south of Liuhe, were completely routed. According to preliminary statistics: over 8,000 Chiang army officers and soldiers were captured alive, and all light and heavy weapons and ammunition were seized.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 5th] The Chiang army's 89th Division, completely annihilated by the South Manchuria Democratic Allied Army on the 3rd in the Honglazi and Youfangjie area south of Liuhe, belonged to the 13th Army, commanded by Shi Jue. It was originally Tang Enbo's old unit, also known as Chiang army’s central direct line troops, and was entirely equipped with American weapons. This division was the main force of the 13th Army, commanded by Wan Zhiren, from Cheliu, Anhui, a graduate of the sixth class of the Whampoa Military Academy, and is currently forty years old. This division was originally stationed on the border of Henan and Anhui. After the defeat in the Central Plains Campaign in 1944, it followed the 13th Army westward along the Yangtze River, arriving in Chongqing at the end of December, then to Guiyang, where it was replenished with American equipment and received American training. In 1945, after Japan surrendered, it left Guizhou for Guangdong, arriving in Kowloon, where it received assistance from American imperialism. At the end of November, it arrived in Qinhuangdao and entered Northeast China with the 52nd Army to attack the Rehe liberated area. In the Xiushui Hezi area of West Manchuria, five of its battalions were annihilated by us, after which it guarded the lines between Jinzhou, Shanhaiguan, and Tianjin. Its annihilation this time occurred less than a month after it was transferred east from Rehe to attack the Liaodong liberated area.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 6th] In the large-scale annihilation battle in which the South Manchuria Democratic Allied Army annihilated the American-equipped Chiang army's 13th Army, 89th Division, and the 162nd Regiment of the 54th Division of that army, and captured more than 8,000 Chiang army officers and soldiers, it has now been ascertained that among them were Zhang Xuetang, deputy commander of the 89th Division, and the director of the political department of that division (name to be verified).
    [Xinhua News Agency, West Manchuria, 6th] With frequent victories from North and South Manchuria, over 50,000 people from all walks of life in Qiqihar held a victory celebration rally on the 5th, and welcomed the Chiang army officers and soldiers who had laid down their weapons during the battle. The extra edition about the South Manchuria Democratic Allied Army annihilating one division and one regiment between Liuhe and Tonghua, capturing 8,000 enemies, was distributed throughout the venue. Speakers unanimously pointed out that the victories on various battlefields since the beginning of this year were only the beginning, and the people's victory is sure to come quickly. Finally, the conference unanimously decided to send a telegram to the CCP Central Committee, resolutely defending Chairman Mao and defending the land.
