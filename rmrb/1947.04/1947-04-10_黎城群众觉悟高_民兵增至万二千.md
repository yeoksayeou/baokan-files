　　Licheng Masses Have High Awareness
　　Militia Increases to Twelve Thousand
    [This newspaper's Licheng dispatch] When the Licheng land leveling and replenishment movement came to an end in February of this year, the masses of the entire county conducted ideological education to sum up their emancipation, recognizing from the past reasons why they could not be emancipated that the root of the landlords was Chiang Kai-shek. Currently, Old Chiang wants to carry out a civil war, which is to destroy our emancipation. The masses further improved from class consciousness and requested to join the militia one after another. The masses proposed: "Our struggle to defeat the landlords is a small emancipation; we must also defeat Chiang Kai-shek for a big emancipation!" Li Yidui of Changning, a disabled person, wanted to join the militia. When some people suggested not letting him join, he said: "I can't participate in the war, but my home is at the main intersection; I can stand guard and eliminate traitors." Now, the number of people in the county participating in the militia has reached 7,556. Adding the original militia, there are now a total of 12,552 militiamen in the county. The total population of the county is over 97,200, and the militia accounts for 13 percent of the county's population.

　　黎城群众觉悟高
  　民兵增至万二千
    【本报黎城讯】黎城填平补齐运动在今年二月间走上结束时，全县群众进行了总结翻身的思想教育，从想想过去为啥不能翻身中认识了地主的老根是蒋介石；目前老蒋要进行内战，就是要破坏咱们的翻身。群众由阶级自觉进一步提高，纷纷要求参加民兵。群众提出：“咱们斗倒地主是小翻身，还要斗倒蒋介石来大翻身！”长宁李一堆是个残废要参加民兵，有的人提出不让他参加时，他说：“我不能参战，但我的家在大路口，我可以站岗除奸。”现在全县群众参加民兵者已达七千五百五十六人，加上原有民兵，现全县共有民兵一万二千五百五十二人，全县人口是九万七千二百余人，民兵达到占全县人口的百分之十三。
