Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 21st: Comprehensive reports indicate that during the week of the 14th to the 19th, the Foreign Ministers' Conference discussed two major issues: First, the issue of the U.S. draft "Four-Power Treaty on the Disarmament and Military Administration of Germany" and the Soviet draft "Treaty on Eliminating German Militarism and Preventing German Aggression," discussed on the 14th and 15th. Regarding the U.S. draft, Molotov did not agree, pointing out: (A) The draft did not mention the elimination of Nazism and other forms of militarism in all aspects, focusing only on disarmament and military administration; (B) It did not recognize that the Four Powers should jointly control the Ruhr area, where German military-industrial production was concentrated; (C) It did not contain strong and clear provisions for eliminating various trusts, combines, syndicates, cartels, etc.; (D) It did not mention the necessity for Germany to establish a democratic order; (E) It did not mention land reform to destroy the rural economic foundation of German Nazism; (F) It did not specify under what conditions the occupation could be terminated; (G) The treaty had a term of only 25 years, which was far short of the 40 years advocated by the Soviet Union. In short, Molotov believed that the U.S. draft was not based on the spirit of the Potsdam Agreement, could not achieve the goal of completely eliminating German militarism and Nazism, and left them with many opportunities for revival. Therefore, Molotov insisted on the Soviet proposal (the full text of which can be found in yesterday's and today's dispatches from this agency). Bevin, while agreeing in principle with the U.S. draft, believed that the draft did not "specify in detail the responsibilities and special obligations of the great powers to prevent the resurgence of German aggression" in order to truly "guarantee universal security." He demanded that the draft should be more effectively and richly supplemented according to all past Allied agreements and resolutions on this issue, and specifically proposed supplementing the content of eliminating German militarism in the economic and cultural aspects. He requested that the draft clearly stipulate that Germany should not be allowed to rebuild military affairs and arm the left bank of the Rhine, that the potential of German military industry should be eliminated, and that the Ruhr and Rhine must become special political entities. British representative Bevin, however, followed Marshall's lead and expressed so-called "welcome" to the U.S. draft.

    Partial Agreement Reached on Austrian Treaty; Yugoslavia Demands Restoration of Invaded Territory
    Second, the issue of the draft Austrian treaty, discussed from the 16th to the 19th. The draft treaty consists of 59 articles and 10 annexes; the four foreign ministers began discussing it article by article on the 16th. The main agreements reached by the four foreign ministers on the 16th and 17th included: prohibiting the merger of Germany and Austria and activities of Pan-German propaganda, abolishing Nazism, organizing Austrian democratic institutions, and regulations on land and air forces (limiting the total number of Austrian armed forces to 53,000 and 90 aircraft), etc. The important parts on which no agreement was reached were preventing Austria from rearming, etc. At the meetings on the 17th and 18th, the four foreign ministers successively listened to the opinions of the Yugoslav and Austrian representatives on the draft treaty. The head of the Yugoslav delegation, Kardelj, and representative Simic, presented eight opinions of Yugoslavia on the draft treaty, regarding the disarmament of Austria to the extent required by its internal affairs; in the area bordering Austria and Yugoslavia, Austria should delineate a depth of 20 kilometers and completely abolish military equipment; in addition, they requested that Carinthia, which was taken from Slovenia after the First World War, be划划归归 Yugoslavia, that the Austrian treaty allow 70,000 Yugoslavs in Austria to enjoy special autonomy, and that Austria should give Yugoslavia reparations of 150 million U.S. dollars and repay all vehicles, ships, and cultural materials plundered from Yugoslavia. Regarding Yugoslavia's territorial claims, the chief Austrian representative, Grueden, opposed them at the Foreign Ministers' meeting on the 18th. The Foreign Ministers' meeting on the 19th continued to discuss the clauses on the Austrian border issue in the draft Austrian treaty.

    外长会议讨论四强对德条约
    莫洛托夫坚持苏联提案
    【新华社陕北二十一日电】综合导报：自十四日至十九日一周中，外长会议讨论了两个重大问题：第一、为十四、十五两日所讨论之美国所提“四强解除德国军备与军政条约草案”和苏联所提“清除德国军国主义及防止德国侵略条约草案”问题。关于美国所提草案，莫洛托夫不予赞同，并指出：（甲）该草案并未提到在各方面清除纳粹主义及其他形式的军国主义，只着眼于解除军备与军政；（乙）没有承认四强应当共同管制德国军需工业集中地的鲁尔地区；（丙）没有强烈明确之条款规定以清除各种托拉斯、康平恩、辛迪卡、卡特尔等；（丁）没有提到德国应有建立民主秩序之必要；（戊）没有提到土地改革以摧毁德国纳粹主义之农村经济基础；（己）并未说明必须在什么条件下占领方可终止；（庚）该条约有限期为二十五年，与苏联所提主张之四十年相差甚远。要之，莫洛托夫认为美国这个草案没有根据波茨顿决议的精神，不能达到彻底消灭德国军国主义与纳粹主义之目的，而且是给它们留下许多复活的余地。因此，莫洛托夫坚持苏联的提案（该提案全文见昨今两日本社电讯），比道尔虽在原则上同意美国草案，但却认为该草案未“详细载明防止德国侵略再起的列强责任及特别义务”，以真正“保证普遍安全”，他要求应当根据过去盟国对此问题之一切协议与决议，更有效的更丰富的来补充这个草案，并具体的提出了要补充在经济及文化方面消除德国军国主义的内容。对于不允许德国重建军务和武装莱茵左岸，消灭德国军事工业潜在力，以及鲁尔和莱茵之必须成为特别政体等，要求在草案中均明确有所规定。英代表贝文却尾随马歇尔之后，对美国草案表示所谓“欢迎”。
    对奥和约已获部分协议南国要求恢复被侵领土
    第二、为十六日至十九日所讨论的对奥和约草案问题，该草约共五十九条及十个附件；四外长于十六日起，开始逐条讨论。四外长于十六、十七两日所获协议部分主要者有：禁止德奥合并及泛日尔曼宣传之活动，废除纳粹，组织奥国民主机构，陆空军之规定（限制奥国武装部队之总数为五万三千人、飞机九十架）等。其未获协议部分之重要者，为防止奥国重整军备等等。十七、十八两日之会议上，四外长先后听取南斯拉夫代表与奥国代表对于和约草案之意见。南代表团团长卡德利及代表席米区提出南国对和约草案，关于解除奥国武装至其内政所需要之限度；奥南接壤地带，奥国应划出二十公里的纵深地区，完全废止军备等八项意见外，并要求将第一次大战后从斯洛文尼亚割去的卡伦地亚划归南国，以及对奥和约允许给予在奥境的七万南斯拉夫人以特殊的自治地位；奥国应给予南国赔款一万万五千万美元及偿还从南掠去的一切车辆、船只、文化资材等。对于南国所提的领土要求，奥国首席代表格鲁登，在十八日的外长会议上，竟表反对。十九日外长会议席上继续讨论对奥和约草案中关于奥国边疆问题之条款。
