    [Xinhua News Agency, Shaanxi Front, 21st Dispatch] The broad masses of people in Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia have risen up to kill the enemy, and guerrilla warfare has developed universally, placing the invading Chiang-Hu troops in a predicament of being夹击 (attacked from both sides) by the people's armed forces, regular troops, and guerrillas. The people of Zichang (formerly Anding County) have recently fought against scattered Chiang troops, achieving repeated victories. A group of sixteen enemy soldiers in plain clothes came out from Qingjian a few days ago to scout around Wayaobao. When they reached Qiuyugou in the eastern second district of Zichang, they were discovered by five militiamen, who opened fire and pursued them. The enemy soldiers in plain clothes fled in panic. At this time, the nearby masses also rose to help fight, and the shouts shook the sky, resulting in the capture of six of them alive and the killing of one. At the same time, the militiamen of Xichuan in Wayaobao also repelled over two hundred Chiang-Hu troops who were looting grain. The masses in a certain village in the county took the guns while the Chiang-Hu troops were fast asleep at night, and captured more than ten enemies. The Yanchang guerrillas cleverly killed the enemy. On the 5th of this month, the Chiang Kai-shek county government going to Yanchuan to take office was defeated by the guerrillas when passing through a certain place in the county. Two days ago, the guerrillas attacked a Chiang-Hu army transport team at Majiawan, killing a company deputy and seizing mules, horses, flour, and other supplies. Several well-trained small guerrilla teams in the Nanniwan reclamation area are attacking the enemy everywhere on the sixty-mile front of Nanniwan, Jinpenwan, and Linzhen. In the Linzhen area, they fought eight times in four days, capturing fourteen Chiang-Hu soldiers alive. The guerrilla team led by militia company commander Liu Lian fought twice on March 18th alone, capturing seven Chiang-Hu soldiers alive and returning the looted grain to the masses. At present, guerrilla warfare is also active near Yan'an. Guerrillas and militiamen often appear at night on Qingliang Mountain and Pagoda Mountain. The militiamen and guerrillas in the Qiao'ergou and Lijiachu areas have fought dozens of times, killing, wounding, and capturing over a hundred Chiang-Hu soldiers. According to prisoners, the Chiang-Hu troops were quite rampant when they first occupied Yan'an, and three or five people went down to the countryside to ravage the people everywhere. Currently, guerrilla teams are active in Yangjialing, Zaoyuan, Hougou, Peiguichuan outside the North Gate of the Yan'an suburbs, and Du Fuchuan outside the South Gate. Scattered enemies no longer dare to go out. The guerrillas even appear in the Dongguan Airport during the day. Due to the insufficient strength of the Chiang-Hu army, each is stationed with a regiment in Wayaobao, Qingjian, Yanchuan, and Yanchang. The combat troops are 80 to 120 li apart from each other. They do not connect with each other on a normal basis and only stay in the city and don't take a step away. In the vast countryside and along the rivers, the masses are tensely engaged in production and wartime service work. In addition, due to the continuous victories in the guerrilla warfare in the Guanzhong Sub-district, a vast area has been recovered. The Chiang-Hu troops are only trapped in four or five strongholds such as Malan, Miaowan, and Liulin.

    胡军困守孤城进退两难
    【新华社陕北前线二十一日电】陕甘宁广大人民纷起杀敌，游击战争普遍发展，使侵入之蒋胡军陷于人民武装、正规军与游击队夹击的困境中。子长（原安定县）人民近日对零散出动的蒋军作战，迭获胜利。日前由青涧出来敌便衣十六名，到瓦窑堡一带侦察，当其行至子长东二区湫浴沟时，被五个民兵发现，开枪追击，敌便衣慌忙逃窜。此时附近群众亦起而助战，喊声震天，结果活捉其六名，另一名毙命。同时，瓦窑堡西川民兵，亦将抢粮之二百余名蒋胡军击退。该县某村群众，乘蒋胡军夜间熟睡之际，将枪拿走，捉敌十余名。延长游击队机智杀敌，本月五日，去延川赴任的蒋记县政府路经该县某地时，为游击队击溃。前二日该游击队在马家湾袭击蒋胡军运输队，毙其连副一名，缴获骡马及面粉等物资甚多。南泥湾垦区的几支精干小型游击队，在南泥湾、金盆湾、临镇的六十里战线上，到处打击敌人。在临镇区，四天作战八次，活捉蒋胡军十四名。民兵刘连长率领之游击队，三月十八日一天作战两次，活捉蒋胡军七名，并将被抢去之粮食发还群众。目前延安附近游击战争亦活跃，游击队与民兵常于夜间出没于清凉山与宝塔山上。桥儿沟、李家渠一带民兵游击队，已作战数十次，毙伤俘蒋胡军百余名。据俘虏说：胡军占延安，最初颇为猖狂，三五个人即下乡到处蹂躏人民。现延市近郊北门外之杨家岭、枣园、后沟、裴柜川及南门外之杜甫川等地，均有游击队活动，零星敌人已不敢再行外出。游击队甚至白日出现于东关之飞机场。由于蒋胡军兵力不足，在瓦窑堡、清涧、延川、延长现均各驻一个团，战斗部队相互距离八十里至一百二十里不等，平时亦不相连，只困守城垣不走开一步。广大乡村及大川两旁，群众均紧张进行生产及服务战时勤务工作。比外关中分区，由于游击战争连获胜利，已恢复广大地区，蒋胡军仅困守马栏、庙湾、柳林等四五个据点。
