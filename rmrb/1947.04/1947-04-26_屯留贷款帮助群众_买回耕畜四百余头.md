    [This newspaper's Taiyue dispatch of the 25th] Tunliu Bank has issued 17,355,000 yuan in loans to help the people purchase draught animals. The county has 747,269 mu of cultivated land, but only 8,815 head of draught animals.

To solve the people's difficulties with draught animals, our democratic government has studied solutions with the bank. In addition to mobilizing the people to use their savings to buy animals together, the bank first issued a loan of 2,725,000 yuan last winter to help the people organize transportation and buy back livestock with principal and interest. According to a survey at the end of March, 127 head of livestock were purchased using this method, with an average price of 20,000 yuan lower per head than the livestock prices this spring. Secondly, loans were issued to cooperatives to trade livestock. In January, another 3,000,000 yuan in livestock loans were issued, buying back 122 head of livestock. Thirdly, small short-term loans were adopted. Anyone who did not have enough capital to purchase draught animals was allowed to borrow. One hundred and twenty head of draught animals were purchased using this method. Finally, sixty head of draught animals were purchased from spring plowing loans. A total of four loans, totaling 17,355,000 yuan, helped the people of the county purchase 145 donkeys, 259 cattle, and 15 mules and horses, for a total of 429 head.

　　屯留贷款帮助群众
    买回耕畜四百余头
    【本报太岳二十五日电】屯留银行以一千七百卅五万五千元贷款，帮助群众购买耕畜。该县耕地七十四万七千二百六十九亩，仅有耕畜八千八百一十五头，根据去年调查，再增加三千五百八十一头耕畜，方可耕种全部土地。我民主政府为解决群众耕畜困难，特与银行研究解决办法，除动员群众拿出积蓄伙买外，银行于去冬首次贷款二百七十二万五千元，帮助群众组织运输，以本利买回牲口。据三月底调查，用此办法买到牲口一百廿七头，平均每头较今春畜价低二万元。其次，贷款给合作社贩买牲口，一月份又发放牲畜贷款三百万元，买回牲口一百廿二头。再次，采用零星短期贷款，凡购买耕畜无足够资本者，即准其贷款。用此种办法买到耕畜一百二十头。最后，从春耕贷款中买到耕畜六十头。共计四次贷款，一千七百卅五万五千元，帮助全县群众购买毛驴一百四十五头，牛二百五十九头，骡马十五头，共四百二十九头。
