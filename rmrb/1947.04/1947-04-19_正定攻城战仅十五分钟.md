Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 17th. Frontline reporters report that in the recent battle around Shijiazhuang, the People's Liberation Army captured Zhengding, a town north of the Ping-Han Railway defended by over 5,000 Chiang Kai-shek and puppet troops, in just fifteen minutes. The city walls were ten meters high, with a moat six meters wide and five meters deep, located north of the Hutuo River, surrounded by over 300 bunkers and fortifications. The defenders were the 19th Regiment of the 7th Division of Chiang Kai-shek's Third Army and the puppet Hou Ruyong headquarters, along with its three subordinate training regiments, the 13th and 14th. Chiang Kai-shek and his puppets, relying on such forces to defend the high-walled and deep-moated city of Zhengding, often boasted that it was impregnable. When the People's Liberation Army encircled the city on the 11th, the Chiang Kai-shek and puppet troops retreated to the city walls, attempting to defend it with their strength. Unexpectedly, after the People's Liberation Army quickly cleared the outer city fortifications, it crossed the outer moat and scaled the city walls in just fifteen minutes under the cover of intense artillery fire. The defending Chiang Kai-shek troops were completely trapped, stunned by the bravery and decisiveness of the People's Liberation Army, and most surrendered. A dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 14th reported that "the enemy troops in Zhengding withdrew automatically," which was merely a cover-up.

　　正定攻城战仅十五分钟
    【新华社晋察冀十七日电】前线记者报导正定攻城战称：此次石庄外围作战，蒋伪军五千余人，所据守的平汉北段城镇正定城，仅十五分钟即为我军攻克。该城高三丈、濠宽二丈、深丈五，位于滹沱河北，周围碉堡工事三百余处。守城者即为蒋军第三军七师十九团与伪侯如墉总部，及其所辖之干训十三、十四三个团。蒋伪以如此兵力踞守此一城高濠深的正定城垣，常自吹嘘可保无虞。十一日人民解放军向该城合围时，蒋伪军即退聚城垣，企图凭此坚守。不意人民解放军于迅速扫清城关工事后，在猛烈炮火掩护下，仅十五分钟即越过外壕登上城垣。守城蒋军全为瓮中之鳖，他们为解放军的勇猛果敢精神惊得目瞪口呆，大部均缴械就俘。中央社十四日电讯报导：“正定敌军自动撤出”云云，不过是遮丑而已。
