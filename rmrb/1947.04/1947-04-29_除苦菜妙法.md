　　Wonderful Method for Eliminating Sow Thistle
　　·Zhang Wenqi·
　　During the spring plowing season, sow thistle grass is found in the fields, and it has already sprouted. The characteristic of sow thistle is that it is a perennial plant, and once it starts growing in one place, it spreads piece by piece. In two or three years, it will spread all over the field, and hoeing cannot remove the roots. We convened a technical committee, and Comrade Sang Shanao, a labor hero from Licheng, introduced the good methods his village used last year to remove sow thistle, so I am introducing it to various places for everyone to try.

　　The characteristic of sow thistle is that it is not afraid of the cold in winter, and the roots cannot be frozen to death, but it is most afraid of things that generate heat. As soon as sprouts are discovered, sprinkle wheat bran on the ground where there is sow thistle, enough to cover the ground. When plowing, some wheat bran can be put into the plow furrow where there is sow thistle. Hoeing the sow thistle twice in a row will weaken its ability to grow. Villages near distilleries can use distiller's grains, which work best. Just pour the distiller's grains into the plow furrow where there is sow thistle, and the roots can be removed. The above two methods not only remove sow thistle, but can also act as fertilizer.

　　除苦菜妙法
    ·张文琦·
    春耕时候，地里有苦菜草、现已发芽出土。苦菜的特性是熟根草，地里一发就传的一片一片，二、三年就传的满地都是，锄也除不了根。我们召开技术委员会，黎城劳英桑山凹同志介绍出他村去年锄苦菜的好办法，所以介绍各地、大家试用。
    苦菜特性是冬天不怕冷，冻不死根，但它最怕发烧的东西。一发现出芽时，就用麦糠撒住有苦菜的地上，撒的遮掩地面就行。在耕的时候，可用一部分麦糠，溜到有苦菜的犁壕内，连锄两次苦菜，根就没劲长了。离酒坊近的村用酒糟最好啦，只把酒糟灌到有苦菜的犁壕内，就可除根了。以上两种办法，不仅除了苦菜，还能顶上粪。
