　　Welfare Nursery
  　Celebrating Children's Day
    [Report from our newspaper] On the occasion of the April 4th Children's Day, the Welfare Nursery's teachers, educators, and staff led all the children in the nursery to celebrate this joyful holiday for children. On this day, a parents' meeting was also held to summarize the work of the past year and propose directions for the future. The summary noted that the nursery had experienced and overcome various difficulties to reach its present state. Last year, there was a shortage of funds for the new establishment, no doctor, and many of the caregivers were housewives without work experience. Furthermore, the war's impact and several relocations caused difficulties for the work. Through various efforts, primarily with the help of various people who raised more than two million yuan in funds, a doctor was secured, and the caregivers' work experience and enthusiasm gradually increased. The Border Region Government also provided significant assistance, enabling the gradual overcoming of various difficulties. The future work lies in further improving the professional level and educating caregivers to better serve this next generation. In their speeches, the parents also pointed out that the nursery provided great help to them, allowing them to concentrate more on revolutionary work, and the children also received good education and upbringing under a regulated collective life. The caregivers also proposed that they should be more enthusiastic in caring for the children in the future. After dinner, an evening party was held on the playground. The children's own puppet troupe performed programs such as "Brother and Sister Reclaiming Wasteland" (shortened version), "The Blue Sky Soars," and "Learning to Fight." Under the gaze of many, the children performed naturally, and the onlookers clapped their little hands and laughed, fully revealing the fresh and active spirit of this new generation.

　　福利托儿所
  　欢度儿童节
    【本报讯】四四儿童节，福利托儿所职教员、保育员，领导全所儿童，欢度这个孩子们愉快的节日。这一天并举行了家长座谈会，总结去年工作提出今后方向。总结中提出托儿所曾经历和克服了各种困难，才达到今天这样局面；去年新开办经费缺少，没有医生，保育员多是家庭妇女，没有工作经验，又加战争影响、几次搬家，这都使工作遭到困难。经过各种努力，首先是得各方人士帮助，募集了二百余万元基金，也有了医生，保育员，工作经验和热情也逐渐提高，边府又给了不少帮助，使各种困难逐渐克服。今后工作是如何使业务更加提高一步，教育保育员更好的为这后一代的人服务了。各家长在发言中也指出：托儿所给了作父母的很大帮助，使他们能更集中精力于革命工作，孩子们在规律的集体生活下也得到很好的教养。保育员也提出今后应当更热心照顾孩子。晚饭后在操场举行晚会，孩子们自己的娃娃剧团表演兄妹开荒（比原剧减短）、青天高涨、学打仗等节目，在很多人注视下，孩子们自然的表演着，围看的拍着小手欢笑着，充分显露着这新的一代的新鲜活跃的精神。（周罗、罗彦）
