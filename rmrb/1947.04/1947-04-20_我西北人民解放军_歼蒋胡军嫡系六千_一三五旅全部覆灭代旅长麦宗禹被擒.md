　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi Front, Urgent Telegram, 17th: The Northwest People's Liberation Army concentrated a part of its main force and, from 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM on the 14th, after eight hours of intense fighting, annihilated the entire 135th Brigade of Chiang Hu's 15th Division, over 6,000 troops, in the Yangma River and Qianhou Jieshao area, 30 li south of Wayaobao. Acting Brigade Commander Mai Zongyu (note: Mai was originally the deputy brigade commander of the brigade; its brigade commander, Zhu Xianian, was resting in Luochuan due to illness), 404th Regiment Commander Chen Jian, 405th Regiment Commander Chen Yaohuang, and deputy regimental commanders, chief of staff, and other officers and soldiers, over 4,000 people in total, were captured alive. Nearly 1,000 enemies were killed or wounded. Only a few hundred of the brigade's covering troops and non-combatants narrowly escaped because they were close to Chiang Hu's Liu Kan's reinforcing troops at the front. The number of items seized was quite high, and they are currently being inventoried. It should be noted that the 135th Brigade was an elite unit of Chiang Hu's forces, while the 15th Division was formerly Liu Maoen's old unit. Chiang Hu incorporated the 135th Brigade into the 15th Division to monitor the 15th Division.
　　
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi Front, Urgent Telegram, 18th: This agency's special correspondent, Lin Lang, reports the following on the annihilation of Chiang Hu's 135th Brigade: The Chiang Hu army, shrinking its head like a snail, was crawling forward, led by Dong Zhao and Liu Kan with the main force of eight brigades, in the mountainous and narrow valleys of Panlong (90 li northeast of Yan'an) to Wayaobao, less than 50 li in length and width, spinning around in circles for a week already. During the day, they formed several columns, slowly trudging up and down the mountains, firing randomly with artillery and dense machine-gun fire into the endless mountains of northern Shaanxi. At night, they camped in the desolate mountains, soldiers hungry and cold, blindly walking around, worrying about their lives. The powerful Northwest People's Liberation Army effectively depleted the enemy's ammunition and intensified their fatigue. On the morning of April 14th, the Chiang Hu army's 135th Brigade, entrenched in Wayaobao, cautiously moved south from Wayaobao, relying on the eight brigades to provide support from the southwest. The despicable and cowardly enemy dared not take the main road, choosing only to climb the mountains. When they had traveled 30 li, a unit of the Northwest People's Liberation Army suddenly appeared in front, behind, and on the flanks of their main force. Immediately, the Hu army formation was extremely chaotic. They quickly occupied several hilltops, hiding their livestock and command posts next to the mountains, and frantically resisted. However, the valiant people's artillerymen and machine gunners, with their strong firepower and accurate shooting, sent the Hu army troops running all over the mountains, and the flying dust obscured the clear sky. Although several Chiang planes constantly circled and strafed, it was of no use. The Hu army commanders ordered the establishment of a radio station, attempting to call for assistance; however, due to the fierce firepower of the People's Liberation Army, it failed several times. In this way, fierce battles were fought mountain by mountain until dusk. Finally, the People's fighters, with outstanding bravery, fought their way up the remaining positions of the Hu army on the mountain tops, and finally annihilated them all. The Hu army advancing northward from the south was less than five li away, yet the People's Liberation Army was still able to prevent them from providing support. At the same time, a regiment of the Hu army left to guard Wayaobao did not dare to reinforce them either. The annihilation of the 135th Brigade was the second brigade of the Chiang army to be annihilated since they occupied Yan'an on March 19th. It was only 20 days from March 25th when the 31st Brigade of the 27th Division was first annihilated in Qinghuabian, 70 li northeast of Yan'an. And from April 3rd, when the 135th Brigade invaded Wayaobao, to the time of its complete annihilation, it was also only 12 days.

　　我西北人民解放军
    歼蒋胡军嫡系六千
    一三五旅全部覆灭代旅长麦宗禹被擒
    【新华社陕北前线十七日急电】西北人民解放军集中主力一部，于十四日自晨十时至下午六时，经八小时激烈战斗，将蒋胡军整十五师一三五旅全部六千余人歼灭于瓦窑堡南三十里之羊马河、前后接哨一线。生俘代旅长麦宗禹（按：麦原为该旅副旅长，其旅长祝夏年因病留洛川休养），四○四团长陈简，四○五团长陈耀煌及副团长、参谋主任等以下官兵四千余人，毙伤敌近千人，仅该旅掩护部队和非战斗人员数百人，因在先头紧靠蒋胡军刘戡之接援部队，侥幸漏网。缴获颇多，正清查中。按一三五旅为蒋胡嫡系部队，而十五师为刘茂恩旧部。蒋胡将一三五旅编入十五师，系监视十五师者。
    【新华社陕北前线十八日急电】本社特派记者林朗报导蒋胡军一三五旅被歼之经过如下：紧缩着头像蜗牛一样匍匐前进的蒋胡军，以八个旅主力由董钊、刘戡率领，在蟠龙（延安东北九十里）至瓦窑堡纵横不足五十里的高山狭谷间，团团打转，已经有一星期了。他们白天排成几路纵队，迟缓地在山头上上下跋涉，用排炮和密集的机枪火力向无穷尽的陕北丛山中乱放。夜晚就在荒山里露营，士兵饿着肚皮，挨着冻，盲目的走来走去，忧虑着自己的生命。而强大的西北人民解放军，则有效的消耗敌人的弹药和加深其疲劳。四月十四日晨，盘据瓦窑堡的蒋胡军一三五旅，依靠那八个旅从西南接应，小心翼翼地自瓦窑堡向南出动，卑劣怯懦的敌人不敢走大路，只是选择山头爬行。当他们走了三十里的时候，西北人民解放军一部突然出现在它的主力前后和侧翼。于是，胡军队形立即非常混乱了。他们赶快占住几个山头，把牲口和指挥所隐蔽到山旁边，慌乱抵抗，可是神勇的人民炮手和机枪手以强烈火力和准确射击，把胡军人马打得遍山乱跑，飞扬的尘土遮蔽了清空。蒋机数架虽不断盘旋扫射，但亦无补于事。胡军指挥官命令设电台，企图求援；因人民解放军火力猛烈，以至数次未成。这样逐山激战，直至黄昏。最后人民战士以卓越勇敢、奋力冲上山头胡军的残余阵地，终将其全部歼灭。由南面北进的胡军，对此相距不及五里，而人民解放军仍能使其接应不上。同时，留守瓦窑堡之胡军一个团，亦不敢增援。一三五旅之被歼，为蒋军于三月十九日进占延安以来被歼之第二个旅。距三月二十五日第一次被歼于延安东北七十里青化砭之整二十七师三十一旅，为时不过二十天。而一三五旅自四月三日侵占瓦窑堡至其全部覆灭时，亦仅十二天。
