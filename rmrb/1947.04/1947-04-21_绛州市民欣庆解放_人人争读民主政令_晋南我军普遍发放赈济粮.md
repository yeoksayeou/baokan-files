    [Report from our Taiyue Office, 20th] The morning after the liberation of Jiangzhou in southern Shanxi, all of the city's three hundred-plus stores, large and small, opened for business, with customers coming and going in a constant stream. Crowds gathered at the intersection and in front of the notice boards, eagerly reading the announcements of the democratic government. An old man in a long gown and mandarin jacket, while looking at the decree on supporting industry and commerce, repeatedly nodded to himself and muttered: "Right! Right! This is what you call virtuous governance! There's a way for us business people to survive!" Merchants particularly praised the democratic government's decree abolishing all the harsh taxes and levies that restricted the development of industry and commerce. Zhang Shutian, the president of the Chamber of Commerce, told reporters: "This regulation is really good. The way the Second War Zone (referring to Yan Xishan) did things, the business community really couldn't make a living. The money we made every day wasn't even enough to pay the grain taxes and levies." He listed more than ten types of taxes and levies imposed on merchants by the brutal rule of Chiang and Yan. In addition, merchants had to participate in "soldier-peasant integration" formations, and those who did not want to be soldiers had to hire someone to take their place, causing many merchants to lose their fortunes or close their businesses. In less than a year, more than one hundred businesses in X绛 (Xin Jiang) closed down.
    [Report from our Taiyue Office, 20th] After the People's Liberation Army of Southern Shanxi liberated cities such as X绛 (Xin Jiang), Jishan, and Hejin, the democratic government specially allocated several thousand dan of wheat for relief because the people there had suffered greatly under the oppression of Chiang and Yan for the past year, leaving most families destitute. In recent days, from morning to night, farmers from all around, supporting the old and carrying the young, came to the city with baskets and carrying poles to receive grain. For the first time, joy appeared on their thin, sallow faces. When the reporter arrived in Hejin, he happened to see a group of farmers carrying grain out of the city, saying as they walked: "The armies and governments of the past are very different from the current one." A middle-aged woman in tattered clothes said: "This is saving our lives. If it weren't for this life-saving army, we wretched ones wouldn't even be able to live for another day." An old man with silver hair replied: "That's right, this is our army. This army used to be called the Red Army, and it passed through here more than ten years ago. Everything they do is for us common people." At this moment, the soldier guarding the city gate smiled and pointed to the slogan "Eliminate the bandits" on the wall, saying: "Old man, but they call us 'bandits.'" The old man threw the grain bag from his shoulder to the ground, widened his eyes, and said: "'Bandits'? May those fellows be struck by lightning! Don't we common people know who is good and who is bad?" He patted the grain bag: "I see it in my eyes, and I remember it in my heart. I'll never forget it in my life!"

    绛州市民欣庆解放
    人人争读民主政令
    晋南我军普遍发放赈济粮
    【本报太岳二十日电】晋南绛州解放后的第二天清晨，全城三百余家，大小商店即全部开市，顾客络绎不绝。十字街及布告牌前，人群拥挤，争看民主政府的布告。一位身穿长衫马褂的老者，一面看着布告上关于扶植工商业的法令，一面不断点头自语：“对！对！这才叫做德政！有作生意人的活路了！”商人对于民主政府法令中取消一切限制工商业发展的苛捐杂税，特别称赞，商会会长张书田对记者说：“这一条规定实在好。二战区（指阎锡山）那个作法，商界实在过不下日子了。每天卖的钱还不够纳粮出款。”他列举蒋阎暴政加诸商人身上的捐税，达十余种。此外，商人也必须参加“兵农合一”编组，不愿当兵者，则须雇人顶替，许多商人因此倾家荡产，或闭门休业。不到一年，新绛全城倒闭商号即有一百余家。
    【本报太岳二十日电】晋南人民解放军解放新绛、稷山、河津等城后，因该地人民一年来受尽蒋阎压榨，十室九空，民主政府特拨小麦数千石予以救济。近几日来，自晨至晚，四乡农民，扶老携幼，拿筐挑担到城里领粮。黄瘦的脸上，第一次露出了欢喜。记者行抵河津时，适值一群领粮农民扛着粮食从城内出来，边走边说：“过去的军队、政府，同现在的大不同了。”一个衣衫褴褛的中年妇女说：“这可救下命了。要不是这救命的队伍，咱凄惶得连一天也活不下去了。”一位头发银白的老汉回答她说：“可不是，这就是咱们的队伍。这队伍原来叫红军，十来年以前从咱这里过过。什么事都是为咱老百姓的。”这时城门上守卫的战士笑指着墙上“消灭奸匪”的标语说：“老先生，可是人家把咱叫‘土匪’。”老汉把粮袋一下从肩上扔到地下，瞪大眼睛说：“‘土匪’？让那些家伙们挨天雷劈死吧！谁好谁坏，咱老百姓还不清楚？”他用手拍拍粮袋：“我看在眼里，记在心里，一辈子也忘不了的！”
