  　Textile Study and Progress Together
    [Our News] All male and female cadres and dependents of the Central Plains Administrative Committee, from leaders to cooks and civil servants, have been swept into the production upsurge. Comrade Li Jingting spins thread from early morning till late at night, sometimes spinning while holding her baby, sometimes spinning by hand while rocking the cradle. Her technique is skillful and she can consistently persist, spinning more than half a catty (approximately 0.5 kg) per day. Her exemplary actions have broken the sluggish thinking of some comrades who said things like "You can't produce while raising a baby" or "What production? There are no tools, no time." They are all slowly turning to production. Wu Zhengying and Shi Xiuying help each other with the villagers, spinning thread and weaving cloth together through labor exchange. Zhou Min and Zhai Huaixia have good thread spinning skills, and the villagers like to have them spin for them. They earn one thousand yuan for spinning one old catty (slightly more than 0.5 kg). Comrades Sun Ying and Zhang Tao, as well as civil servants, sprout soybeans and sell them to the public or solve their individual vegetable problems.

    In the past, some comrades were uneasy and felt that raising children hindered their progress. Now, everyone is engaged in production, and they have also organized study groups, nurturing revolutionary offspring while engaging in production and study. Life is gradually becoming more intensive.

　　中原干部及家属队
  　纺织学习并进
    【本报讯】中原管委会全体男女干部及家属队，从领导到伙马夫公务员，都卷入生产热潮，李敬亭同志起早睡晚的纺线，有时抱着娃娃纺，有时脚踏摇篮手纺线，技术熟练且能经常坚持，每天能纺半斤多。她的模范行动打破了有些同志说“引娃娃不能生产”，或者说“生什么产？没有工具，没有时间”等疲塌思想，都慢慢转向生产。吴正英、石秀英和老乡互助，合伙纺线、变工织布。周敏、翟怀霞纺线技术好，老乡都喜欢找她们纺，纺老秤一斤，获利一千元。孙英、张韬同志及公务员们，生豆芽卖给公家或解决个人蔬菜问题。
    过去有部分同志不安心，对引小孩也觉妨碍自己进步，现在大家闹生产，又组织了学习小组，一面抚育革命后代，一面生产学习，生活逐渐紧张起来。
