　　Technician Wang Changlao's Three Inventions
    Doubling the Speed of Spinning: 4x Faster
    Winding: 10x Faster
    Twisting: 8x Faster
    [Reported by our newspaper from Pingshun] Wang Changlao, a technician at the Hengji Textile Factory in Pingshun County, came from a working-class background. Under the slogan of improving technology and reforming tools, he strived to improve tools. After three or four months of painstaking research and sleepless nights, he invented the spinning machine, winding machine, and twisting (also known as "glossing") machine, making a significant contribution to the textile industry. The spinning machine only requires one person to pedal a wooden board, and the machine can spin six jin of thread tassels per day. The speed is four times faster than the commonly used spinning wheel. The winding machine requires one person to manually crank the wooden wheel on the belt, which rotates the machine very quickly. It can wind forty jin of thread per day, which is ten times faster than manual winding (four jin of thread per person per day). The twisting machine can twist sixteen jin of thread per person per day, which is eight times faster than manual twisting (two jin per person per day). After the invention of these three machines, they can save twenty-two labor-days per day. The government has already rewarded him, and the machines are named "Changlao Spinning Machine." The words "Changlao" have been added to all three machines. The county and district joint cooperative is currently imitating and promoting them. (The structure and usage of the above three machines will be introduced later.) (Chun Xi)

　　王长劳技师三样发明
    打穗：快四倍
    络线：快十倍
    拐线：快八倍
    【本报平顺讯】平顺县府恒记纺织工厂技师王长劳，是个工人出身，在提高技术改良工具的口号下，对工具力求改进，经过三四个月的苦心钻研，深夜不睡，发明了打穗机、络线机、拐（有叫光线的）线机，对纺织有很大贡献。打穗机，只用一人脚踏木板，机器转动起来每天能打六斤线的穗子，速度比一般用的打穗车增加四倍。络线机，由一人手摇皮带上的木轮，把子机器旋转很快，每天能络线四十斤，比手工络线（每日每人络四斤线）提高十倍。拐线机，每日每人能拐线十六斤，比手工拐线（每日每人拐二斤）提高八倍。这三种机器发明后，每天能省人工二十二个，已得政府奖励，名为长劳打穗机，在上述三个机器上都添上长劳二字，现县区联社正仿造推广中。（关于上述三种机器的构造与使用法，随后介绍。）（春喜）
