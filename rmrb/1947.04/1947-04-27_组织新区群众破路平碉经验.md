　　Experience in Organizing the Masses in New Districts to Destroy Roads and Level碉堡
　　On the third day after the liberation of Qi County, we arrived at a village in the county to organize the masses to destroy roads and level碉堡. We, a group of over thirty people, led more than a thousand people in groups, and in two nights destroyed a large station, more than five li of railway, a total of thirteen碉堡 and bunkers (including five large碉堡), and a section of the city wall. In this destruction, we gained the following experiences, which are written down for reference:

　　One, at the beginning, we divided into four groups and divided a large area of villages west of the city into four small areas (like the base villages in the base areas), leading the four small areas in groups, which was more convenient for gathering at the central village.

　　Two, in the newly liberated district, we have not yet established various organizations. In order to quickly mobilize the masses, we used the old organizational forms, convened meetings of Baojia chiefs or handlers (handler is another name for Bao chief, because they dare not respond to the name of Bao chief), arranged work, and completed it on schedule, which directly helped our mobilization work.

　　Three, in the organization of the masses, we adopted the village as a unit, selected a person in charge as a squad or class (depending on the number of people), and a village area as a large team. The cadres were elected by everyone, and the leading comrades served as instructors or deputy captains, which facilitated leadership and instilled a democratic spirit.

　　Four, in the destruction, in addition to leading, we must also personally go to work, to influence and encourage the masses, and constantly carry out propaganda and education, and pay attention to commending models.

　　Five, it is necessary to divide the work specifically and leave after completion, so that the mood can be high and the task can be completed on time. When work is over, the masses can be allowed to take some wood and wires to solve the difficulty of burning firewood (we do not say, the masses dare not take).

　　Six, to destroy the碉堡, it must be broken first and then burned to be leveled. To destroy the bunkers, it must be burned first and then broken, because the wood is erected under the ground, and it is easy to break after burning. The walls made of barbed wire and thorn branches can be completely dug down and rolled up for burning. When breaking the city wall, if it is estimated that manpower is insufficient, all the碉堡 can be leveled first, and then several large trenches can be dug in the city wall. When breaking, the outer hard skin can be peeled off first, and the loose soil inside will be easily dug down. (Jian Hua, Zhi Xuan, Fan Ke)

　　组织新区群众破路平碉经验
    淇县解放后的第三天，我们到了该县某村，组织群众破路平碉，我们三十多人，分组领导群众一千多人，两晚上破了一个大车站，五里多长的铁路，破碉堡地堡共十三个（内有五个大碉堡），及半截城墙。在这次破毁中获得以下几点经验，特写出供参考：一、开始我们划分了四个小组，并将城西的一大片村庄划分了四小片（像根据地基点村一样），分组领导四小片，到中心村庄集合比较方便。二、刚解放了的新区，我们各种组织都没有建立起来，为了迅速把群众发动起来，就利用旧的组织形式，召开保甲长或办事人会议（办事人是保长的别名，因他不敢应保长名），布置工作，按期完成，这也就直接帮助了咱们的动员工作。三、在群众的组织上，我们是采用以村为单位，选出负责人作为一分队或一班（按人数多寡），以一片村为一个大队，干部由大家选举，领导同志作为指导员或副队长，一面领导方便一面灌输了民主精神。四、在破毁中，我们除领导外，还要亲自动手去劳动，以影响鼓励群众，又随时加以宣传教育，及注意表扬模范。五、要具体分工，完成就走，这样情绪高能按时完成任务。收工时，可让群众拿一些木料电线，解决烧柴困难（我们不说，群众不敢拿）。六、破碉堡要先破后烧，才能平毁，破地堡要先烧后破，因地面下把木头架起，先烧了容易破。用铁丝和圪针柴做的围墙，可全部刨倒后卷起来用火烧。破城墙时，估计人力不足，就可先将碉堡全部平毁，再把城墙刨几道大壕，破时可先把外面的硬皮剥掉，里面的松土就容易刨下去。（建华、智轩、范科）
