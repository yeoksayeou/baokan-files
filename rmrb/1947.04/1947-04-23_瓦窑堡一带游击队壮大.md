Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 21st:

	In Yangjiayuanzi and other villages in the eastern first district of Wayaobao (Zichang County), the guerrilla force, established less than half a month ago, initially had only a few old rifles. Now, each member has at least one American rifle and pistol, as well as American submachine guns, with abundant ammunition. Captured American grenades are no longer valued by the guerrilla members. The morale of the guerrilla force is extremely high, and they frequently go out to capture Hu's troops. Once, 4 guerrilla members repelled two companies of Hu's troops 20 li east of Wayaobao. Another time, a guerrilla member captured an armed communication soldier of Hu's troops on the road, obtaining a submachine gun. On another occasion, five of Chiang's soldiers went to Qiuyugou to loot, and several unarmed civilians first entertained them with wine and food, then seized the opportunity to capture them alive and hand them over to the government. The township governments in this area have also become guerrilla-ized, fighting the enemy when encountered and working when our troops are present. The ten years of peaceful life have been completely changed.

    瓦窑堡一带游击队壮大
    【新华社西北二十一日电】瓦窑堡（子长县）东一区杨家园子等村，游击队成立不到半个月，开始只有几支旧步枪，目前则每人至少有一支美式步枪及短枪，并有美式手提机枪，子弹极多，缴获美式手榴弹已不为游击队员所重视。游击队情绪极高，经常出动捕捉胡军。一次在瓦窑堡东二十里处，四个游击队员打退了胡军两个连。一次一个游击队员在大路上活捉了一个胡军武装交通，得一支手提机枪。某次蒋军五人到湫峪沟抢掠，徒手民众数人先以酒饭款待，继则乘机突然将其活捉，全部送交政府。该地区乡政府亦已游击化，遇敌即作战，遇我军即办公。十年和平生活已全部改变。
