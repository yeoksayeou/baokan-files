[Report from the Yubei Front, this newspaper, 21st] In the battle of Laotian'an (north of the Yellow River Bridge), the 1st Platoon of the 7th Company of a certain regiment, which was responsible for the assault and final retreat, achieved victory without any casualties under heavy artillery fire due to the platoon leader's specific command and the good connection among the whole platoon. The veteran soldiers were good at leading the new soldiers. Of the eleven soldiers in the platoon, only four were veteran soldiers, four were liberated soldiers, and three were new soldiers from southern Ningxia. They were organized into three mutual aid groups, advancing and retreating one after another. The platoon leader made it clear when to prepare grenades, fix bayonets, or lie down. When the Chiang army fired artillery, the new soldiers were afraid, and the platoon leader said, "The closer to the front, the safer. The shells all land and explode behind!" The platoon leader said that the US-made bullets of the Chiang army had sparks, "With sparks, you can see where the bullets are coming from, how high or low they are; it is better to hide than without sparks." Comrades in each group could cover each other. In the battle of Laotian'an, when they were marching towards the enemy, the Chiang army discovered the first group and asked, "What are you doing?" The second and third groups immediately rushed up together, each throwing nine grenades, driving away the Chiang army and occupying the houses. The first group advanced along the north side of the house, and the second and third groups advanced along the south side of the house. When the Chiang army reorganized its firepower to shoot, they could no longer hit them. During the advance, the group leader was in the front, and the veteran soldiers were in the back, sandwiching the new soldiers in the middle to prevent them from being afraid. The veteran soldiers demonstrated great comradeship and gave their helmets to the new soldiers. The veteran soldiers taught the new soldiers to crawl, roll, and lie down at any time, preventing them from staying in the open. After this exercise, the new soldiers gained confidence in fighting. The political director of the regiment personally helped them summarize their experience and introduced it to other units. (Yang Ming, Wu Xiang)

[Report from the Taiyue Front, this newspaper, 22nd] In the Jinan Campaign, many model mutual aid groups have emerged in the People's Liberation Army, greatly improving combat effectiveness. Gong Baoju is a soldier in the 5th Platoon of the 2nd Company of a certain unit. Before the start of this campaign, his group of four held a three-day "Zhuge Liang" meeting to discuss mutual assistance methods on the battlefield. He educated everyone that they should not be dispersed on the battlefield, because if they were dispersed, they would have no strength. In the Xinjiang battle, the Gong Baoju mutual aid group adopted the discussed methods and captured thirteen enemies at once, seizing nine guns. The characteristics of the Zhang Tongheng mutual aid group of the 2nd Company are: not only can they unite and help each other in battle, but also they can conduct good reviews and learn lessons after the battle. In the Mengcheng battle, the company commander Wang Yanzhang was killed. After the battle, the Zhang Tongheng group immediately conducted a review. Everyone believed that the company commander's sacrifice was mainly due to bravery without paying attention to tactics. Then Zhang Tongheng proposed that everyone should accept the lesson of the company commander's sacrifice and called for revenge for the company commander. The Zhao Zhongshan group of the 2nd Battalion × Company is a good example of mutual assistance. In the Xinjiang battle, the group captured 63 enemies, seized 26 rifles, 1 pistol, and 1 small cannon.

    某团七连一班互助得好
    在战斗中无一伤亡
    晋南我军出现许多模范互助组
    【本报豫北前线二十一日电】在老田庵（黄河桥北）战斗中担任突击，并在最后撤退之某团七连一班，由于班长指挥具体，全班互相连系得好，老战士善于带领新战士，全班在猛烈炮火下胜利完成任务，无一伤亡。该班十一人，只有老战士四人，其余解放战士四人，宁南新战士三人，他们组织成三个互助组，前进和后退，都是一个跟一个。啥时准备手榴弹、上刺刀或卧倒，班长都说得很清楚。蒋军打炮时，新战士害怕，班长即说：越在前边越保险。炮弹都落到后边响了！”蒋军美造子弹有火花，班长说：“有花可以看子弹从那里来，打得高低；比没花还好隐蔽。”各小组同志都能互相掩护。老田庵战斗中，他们向敌行进时，蒋军发觉了第一组，喝问“干什么的？”二、三组即一齐猛冲上去，每人打了九个手榴弹，驱逐了蒋军，占领了房子。一组顺北房根前进，二、三组顺南房根前进，蒋军再组织火力射击时，已经打不着他们了。前进中，每组都是组长在前，老战士在后，把新战士夹在中间，让他们不害怕。老战士发扬高度友爱，都把钢盔给新战士戴。老战士随时教新战士爬滚卧倒，不让他们在开阔地上停留。经过这次锻炼，新战士对打仗有了信心。该团政治主任特亲自帮助他们总结经验，介绍给别的单位。（杨明、吴象）
    【本报太岳前线二十二日电】在晋南战役中，人民解放军出现许多模范互助组，大大提高了战斗力。龚宝聚是×部二连五班战士，他的组共四个人，这次战役开始前，他们便开了三天“诸葛亮”会，讨论在战场上互助办法，他教育大家在战场上不可分散，分散了就没有力量，新绛战斗中，龚宝聚互助组采用了讨论出的办法，一下捕捉了十三个敌人，缴获了九支枪。二连张同恒互助组的特点是：不仅在战斗中能够团结互助，并且在战斗后还能够很好的进行检讨，接受教训。在蒙城战斗中，连长王彦章牺牲了，战斗结束后张同恒组立即进行检讨，大家认为连长的牺牲主要是只有勇敢，不讲求战术，接着张同恒便提出大家应当接受连长牺牲的教训，并号召为连长复仇。互助好的是二营×连赵忠山组，在新绛战斗中，该组俘虏敌人达六十三名、缴获步枪二十六支、手枪一支、小炮一门。
