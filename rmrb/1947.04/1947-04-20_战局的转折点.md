　　The Turning Point of the War Situation

　　On April 14th, our Northwest People's Liberation Army achieved a great victory, completely annihilating the Hu Zongnan's reorganized 15th Division, 135th Brigade, near Wayaobao (Anding County). The decisiveness and speed of this annihilation battle, like the battle of Qinghuabian (northeast of Yan'an) on March 25th, in which the 31st Brigade (minus one regiment) was annihilated, can be called a model example.

　　The annihilation of the 135th Brigade marks the beginning of Hu Zongnan's decline.

　　Hu's army, with a large force of more than 100,000 men in sixteen brigades (initially fourteen, later increased by two), invaded Yan'an and northern Shaanxi from the Luochuan-Yichuan line, and this has been going on for just a month. Such a concentrated force attacking a single area is second only to the attack on Linyi in this civil war by the Chiang army, and has not been seen anywhere else. After occupying Yan'an, Hu Zongnan concentrated his main force and rampaged everywhere, using nine brigades to attack Ansai, eleven brigades to attack Yanchang, Yanchuan, and Qinghe, and nine brigades to attack Wayaobao, and eight brigades to rush back to Qinghuabian Panlong. Each time Hu's army attacked, the entire army traveled light, carrying dry rations, forming a square formation forty to fifty li wide, only walking on mountain tops and not on main roads, marching every day and camping every night, advancing twenty to thirty li each day. According to prisoners, this is the so-called new tactic guided by the Ministry of National Defense. This tactic is different from another faction of tactics in the Kuomintang army. The other faction's tactics are considered conservative by Bai Chongxi, Chen Cheng, and others, advocating carrying heavy equipment and concentrating on garrisoning, advancing only about ten li per day, the so-called "using troops should be orthodox and not strange, garrisoning should be concentrated and not dispersed, and marching should be slow and not fast." Comparing these two tactics, the so-called new tactic of the Ministry of National Defense is formally a more frenzied tactic, but in reality, it shows the Kuomintang's dead end, extreme stupidity, and a desperate gamble. Hu Zongnan is using this tactic. According to prisoners, Hu Zongnan also invented the so-called "drilling-the-gaps tactic," detouring when encountering our army, in order to move quickly. In reality, this is a tactic of only walking and not fighting. This tactic shows nothing but Hu Zongnan's cowardice.

　　What are the results of Hu Zongnan applying this tactic? What has already been shown is: First, after occupying some areas, he has to disperse his forces to garrison them, so the force he can concentrate is getting smaller and smaller. Now it has been reduced from fourteen brigades when attacking Yan'an to eight brigades. Second, due to the dispersion of forces, his weaknesses are exposed, and the chances of being annihilated by our army increase. Third, because the people oppose him, Hu's concentrated main force, like a blind man, can only grope around, staging armed parades during the day and mass bivouacs of tens of thousands of people at night. Fourth, due to food shortages, fatigue of the soldiers, and extremely large casualties. According to prisoners, Hu's soldiers only eat one meal of thin porridge and one meal of dry rice a day, and some units simply go hungry. Soldiers who leave the ranks five li away are captured by our guerrillas. Many soldiers get sick from camping out, and many take the opportunity to desert. In one month, the reduction in strength in companies is 60% for the most, and 30% for the least. Under these circumstances, the morale of Hu's army is decreasing at a very fast rate, and its combat effectiveness is decreasing at the same rate.

　　On the side of the military and civilians in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, the situation is completely opposite. Guerrilla warfare is developing rapidly, the combat effectiveness of the People's Liberation Army is rapidly improving, the unity between the army and the people is rapidly strengthening, and the method of annihilating the enemy's effective strength is quickly being understood, so it is becoming stronger and stronger in battle.

　　The complete annihilation of the 135th Brigade shows the bankruptcy of the so-called new tactic of the Ministry of National Defense, and shows that the decline of Hu's army's combat effectiveness and the rise of the Northwest People's Liberation Army's combat effectiveness have reached a turning point. From now on, Hu Zongnan's army will go downhill. The ferocity of Hu's army only lasted for a month, and from now on it will decline. Hu's army can now concentrate only eight brigades, and after the annihilation of the 135th Brigade, even the concentration of eight brigades will be difficult to maintain. If this continues, whether Hu's army continues its offensive or takes a defensive position, it will be a dead end for Hu Zongnan!

　　The complete annihilation of the 135th Brigade has laid the foundation for the Northwest People's Liberation Army to thoroughly crush Hu's army in the future. At the same time, it proves that the Northwest People's Liberation Army is sufficient to defeat Hu Zongnan with its existing strength.

　　The turning point in the Northwest war situation is also the turning point in the national war situation. In terms of the order of events, Hu Zongnan's army is Chiang Kai-shek's last card. By March of this year, when Chiang Kai-shek announced at the Third Plenary Session of the Kuomintang that "a political solution is hopeless," the only offensive force that Chiang Kai-shek could organize with more than a dozen brigades together was Hu Zongnan's force. After convening the bogus National Assembly, Chiang Kai-shek drove out the CCP's representatives stationed in Nanjing, Shanghai, and Chongqing, and ordered the attack on Yan'an, determined to finally break down; his hopes were mainly placed on Hu Zongnan's army. After Hu's army scurried to Yan'an, the Kuomintang was so elated, trumpeting that the occupation of Yan'an was as if the reactionary forces had been saved from now on, and the democratic forces had been doomed from now on, that is the reason. The turning point in the Northwest war situation means that Chiang Kai-shek's last hope has become unreliable. On the side of the People's Liberation Army, the turning point in the Northwest war situation is occurring in a situation where several battlefields have already turned to advantage, and several other battlefields are about to turn to advantage. That is to say, the national war situation will undergo a comprehensive change from now on. It can be predicted that in the two or three months starting in April, the Chiang army will shift from an offensive to a defensive, and the People's Liberation Army will shift from a defensive to an offensive. Chiang Kai-shek will go downhill from now on, and there will be no more capital to save his general decline on the national battlefield. The development of events in the future will prove this estimate. And when the people of the whole country understand this situation, and when the great victories that are now unfolding on the Tongpu Road, Pinghan Road, around Shijiazhuang, and in the Northeast and Shandong areas are fully developed, the collapse of the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique will be accelerated. The development of historical events has been so unexpected: Chiang Kai-shek's occupation of Yan'an will mark Chiang Kai-shek's demise; the People's Liberation Army's abandonment of Yan'an will mark the victory of the Chinese people!

### 战局的转折点

　　战局的转折点
    四月十四日，我西北人民解放军获得大捷，胡宗南部整编一五师一三五旅在瓦窑堡（安定县）附近被我军全部歼灭。此次歼灭战的干脆迅速，与上月二十五日青化砭（延安东北）歼灭三十一旅（缺一个团）之战一样，足称为模范的战例。
    一三五旅的歼灭，标志着胡宗南从此走下坡路。
    胡军以十六个旅（初为十四个旅，后增加两个旅）十余万人之大兵从洛川、宜川之线窜犯延安及陕北，至此刚一个月。这样的集中兵力进攻一地，是蒋军在此次内战中仅次于进攻临沂的一次，在其他地方尚未见过。侵占延安之后，胡宗南集中主力四处乱闯，进攻安塞时用九个旅，进攻延长、延川、清河时用十一个旅，进攻瓦窑堡时用九个旅，回窜青化砭蟠龙时为八个旅，胡军每次进攻，全军轻装，携带干粮，布成横直一四十里之方阵，只走山顶不走大路，天天行军，夜夜露营，每日前进二三十里。据俘虏讲：这是所谓国防部指导的新战术。这种战术，与国民党军队中另一派战术不同。另一派战术是被白崇禧、陈诚等认为保守的那种战术，主张携带重装集中驻扎，每日前进十里左右，即所谓“用兵宜正不宜奇，驻军宜聚不宜散，行军宜缓不宜急的战术”。这两种战术比较起来，所谓国防部新战术，是在形式上表现为比较更疯狂的战术，但在实际上却表现国民党的毫无出路，异常愚蠢与孤注一掷。胡宗南用的就是这种战术。又据俘虏讲：胡宗南又发明了所谓“钻隙战术”，遇到我军绕道而过，以求迅速。这实际上就是不打仗只走路的战术。这种战术除了表示胡宗南的懦怯而外，没有别的。
    胡宗南应用这种战术其结果是怎样呢？现在所已经表现出来的是：第一、占领了一些地区之后，不能不分散兵力担任守备，因而其所能集中的兵力，就越来越小。到现在已由攻延安时的十四个旅减为八个旅。第二、由于分散兵力，因而其薄弱之点就显露出来，被我军歼灭的机会就加多了。第三、因为人民反对，胡军所集中的主力像瞎子一样只能到处扑空，白天武装大游行、晚上几万人集中大露营。第四、由于粮食缺乏，将士疲劳，减员异常巨大。据俘虏供：胡军士兵每天只吃一顿稀饭，一顿干饭，有些队伍干脆饿饭。士兵离开队伍五里即被我游击队捉去。因为露营而病者极多，许多士兵乘机逃亡，一个月中连队中减员多者百分之六十，少者百分之三十几。在这种情形之下，胡军士气以非常快的速度降低下去，其战斗力亦以同样速度降低下去。
    在陕甘宁边区军民方面，情形就完全相反，游击战争很快的发展，人民解放军的战斗力很快提高，军民团结很快增强，歼灭敌人有生力量的作战方法，很快被领会，因而愈战愈强。
    一三五旅的全部被歼，说明所谓国防部新战术的破产，说明胡军战斗力的下降与西北人民解放军战斗力的上升，已经到了一个转折点。从此以后，胡宗南军就要走下坡路了。胡军的凶焰仅仅维持了一个月时间，从此就要下降了。胡军现在所能集中的主力只有八个旅，消灭了一三五旅之后，就连八个旅的集中也将难于维持。这样下去，不论胡军是继续其攻势或者转取守势，对于胡宗南都是死路一条！
    一三五旅的全部歼灭，对于西北人民解放军则奠定了今后彻底粉碎胡军的基础。同时又证明了西北人民解放军仅以自己现有的力量，就足以打败胡宗南。
    西北战局的转折点，同时就是全国战局的转折点。在时间的顺序上说，胡宗南军是蒋介石的最后一张牌。到今年三月，国民党三中全会上，蒋介石宣布“政治解决已经绝望”之时，蒋介石手里还可能组织十几个旅在一起的进攻力量，只剩下胡宗南这一支了。蒋介石于召集伪国大之后，又驱逐中共驻京沪渝代表人员，下令进攻延安，决心最后破裂；其希望主要地寄托在胡宗南这支军队身上。胡军窜抵延安之后，国民党所以那样兴高彩烈，大吹大擂，把占领延安描述为好似反动势力从此得救，民主势力从此倒霉，就是这个道理。西北战局的转折点，意味着蒋介石全部希望的最后寄托，已经靠不住。而在人民解放军方面，西北战局的转折点，是在几个战场已经转入优势，另外几个战场将要转入优势的情况下发生的。这就是说：全国战局将从此全面的起变化。可以预计：四月开始的两三个月内，蒋军将由攻势转变成为守势，人民解放军将由守势转变成为攻势。蒋介石从此走下坡路，再没有什么本钱挽救其普遍全国战场的颓势了。今后事变的发展，将证明这个估计。而当全国人民了解了这种形势之后，当现在正在开展的同蒲路、平汉路、石家庄周围及东北、山东等地区的大胜利充分发展了之后，蒋介石反动集团的崩溃，将会加速起来。历史事变的发展，表现得如此出人意外：蒋介石占领延安，将标志着蒋介石的灭亡；人民解放军的放弃延安，将标志着中国人民的胜利！
