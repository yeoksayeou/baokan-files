　　In Defense of Chairman Mao
    ——Battlefield Poetry
    Ke Gang
            Marching in the Great Sandstorm
    The people's army is marching,
    The giant wind of night suddenly arrives,
    Sand and dust fill the sky, the moon over the Yellow River loses its color,
    Cavalrymen are blown off their horses,
    Soldiers seal their eyes,
    Warhorses raise their long manes,
    The wheels of the artillery carriages are stuck and cannot turn!
    But the powerful army does not stop for a moment,
    Cavalrymen pull on the horses' tails,
    Infantrymen link arms,
    Strong artillerymen push the wheels with their hands,
    They will overcome everything,
    To advance through the sandstorm——
    For the motherland, for themselves, to defend Chairman Mao.
　
            Letter Home
　
    Outside the wall, three young willows, two green cypresses,
    And an old apricot tree, its flowers already faded.
    Just under this tree,
    Li Naichi carefully arranges his heavy machine gun,
    The fortifications are ready, able to withstand even three shells,
    The bullets are loaded, all obstacles to firing cleared,
    In just half an hour, the order to attack will arrive.
    The silence, the rare silence of the battlefield, is unbearable to him,
    He takes out the letter from home and reads it again and again,
    Then he unfolds a clean sheet of paper, places it on the ammunition box, and begins to write:
    "Mother! Chairman Mao has told us to stand up.
    We have houses and land, I am at ease,
    But, I cannot go home to get married this spring,
    Chiang Kai-shek is attacking our Chairman Mao,
    He wants to take back our houses, our land…
    I cannot go back.
    Tell her to wait for me,
    Until Chiang Kai-shek kneels trembling before the people."

　　为了保卫毛主席
    ——战地诗叶
    柯岗
            行进在大风沙里
    人民的兵团在行进，
    夜的巨风突然来临，
    沙尘漫天，黄河岸上的月亮失掉了颜色，
    骑兵从马背上吹落下来，
    兵士密封了眼睛，
    战马竖起了长鬃，
    炮车的轮子滞塞得不能转动！
    可是，强大的兵团一刻也不停，
    骑兵拉着马尾，
    步兵臂挽着臂，
    强壮的炮兵用双手推动车轮，
    他们要战胜一切，
    要穿过风沙去进攻——
    为祖国、为自己、为了保卫毛主席。
　
            家信
　
    围墙之外三株嫩柳，两株翠柏，
    还有一棵老杏树，花儿已经褪色。
    就这棵在树下，
    李乃池把他的重机枪妥当安排，
    掩体已经作好，纵有三颗炮弹也能挨，
    子弹已经上膛，扫清了射击障碍，
    只要再有半点钟，攻击的命令就到来。
    静寂，战地少有的静寂使他难耐，
    他掏出家信看了又看，
    又展开一张净纸，放在弹药箱上写起来：
    “娘！毛主席叫咱翻身。
    有房有地，我放心，
    可是，我今春不能回家结婚，
    蒋介石正在进攻咱毛主席，
    他要夺回咱的房，咱的地………
    我不能回去。
    要她等着我，
    到蒋介石跪在老百姓的面前发抖的时候。”
