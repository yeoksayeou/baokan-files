　　According to sources from Tianjin: The general cost of living in the Pingjin area is more than 50,000 times higher than before the war. In Tianjin, under the bloody rule of the Chiang bandits, the daily living expenses per person have recently risen from 3,000 yuan before the Lunar New Year to 18,000 yuan, requiring 240,000 yuan per month, and even then, one cannot afford meat. This is more than 50,000 times higher than before the war (around 1937). A bath costs more than 10,000 yuan. On the streets, a person walking in front is followed by a group of wailing beggars. The closure of industrial and commercial enterprises is commonplace; recently, the number of banks and grocery stores closing down has increased significantly. The prices of gold, US dollars, and commodities are rising sharply. The price of gold was 400,000 yuan per tael before the Lunar New Year, rising to over 1 million yuan around the 15th day of the first lunar month. After February 20th (Gregorian calendar), all gold shops were closed, and trading was prohibited. The official price was set at 480,000 yuan per tael. The exchange rate for US dollars was 5,600 yuan (old currency) after the Lunar New Year, rising to 18,000 yuan around the 15th day of the first lunar month. The current readjusted exchange rate is 12,000 yuan; however, it is only allowed for remittances and not for transactions. Silver: 4,500 yuan before the Lunar New Year, later rising to 8,500 yuan, and now transactions are also prohibited. From before the Lunar New Year to after the 15th day of the first lunar month, prices have increased by an average of more than 100%. For example, white cloth was priced at 80,000 to 90,000 yuan per bolt before the Lunar New Year, and around March 7th, the price was 160,000 yuan. During the same period, flour rose from 800 to 900 yuan per catty to 1,400 yuan per catty, and even reached 1,800 yuan per catty around February 6th and 7th (Gregorian calendar). The average price index for all commodities is 220.9% (based on the prices before the Lunar New Year). At the same time, American goods are imported in large quantities without any restrictions, flooding the market, further causing large-scale closures of industrial and commercial enterprises.

　　平津一带一般物价较抗战前涨五万倍
    【本报讯】据天津来人谈：平津一带一般生活费用较战前上涨五万余倍。在蒋贼血腥统治下的天津，最近每人每日之生活费，已由旧历年前的三千元涨到一万八千元，每月需要二十四万元，还吃不到肉。较战前（一九三七年左右）上涨五万余倍。洗一次澡需要一万多元。在街上前边走一个人，后边即跟一群哀呼的乞丐。工商业的倒闭，已属屡见不奇的事情；最近银号与杂货业关门者，尤其显著的增多。黄金、美钞、物价益形上涨，金子旧历年后每两四十万元，旧历正月十五前后涨到一百多万元，自阳历二月廿日后金店全被封闭，不准买卖，定官价为四十八万元一两。美钞年关后五千六百元（旧历），正月十五号前后涨到一万八千元，现再次调整之外汇率为一万二千元；但只准汇款，不准成交。白银：年前四千五百元，后涨到八千五百元，现亦不准成交。自旧历年前至正月十五日后，物价平均上涨一倍以上。如白洋布每匹旧历年时价八至九万元，三月七日左右价十六万元。同时期面粉每斤由八至九百元涨至一千四百元，在阳历二月六、七日且曾涨到一千八百元一斤，各物价平均指数为百分之二百二十·九（以旧历年时为基数）。同时，美货大量入口，毫无限制，充斥市场，更促使工商业大批倒闭。
