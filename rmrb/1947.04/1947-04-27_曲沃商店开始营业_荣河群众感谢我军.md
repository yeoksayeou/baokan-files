　　Quwo Store Opens for Business
　　Ronghe Masses Thank Our Army
　　[Report from the Taiyue Front, April 22nd by this newspaper] When this reporter visited Principal Yin Xianghua of the vocational school in Quwo city, along with teachers Gu Zi'an and Liu Shushan, they first told me about the People's Liberation Army's strict discipline and that they did not violate even the slightest thing belonging to the people. They said: The day before yesterday, when the city was attacked at 5 PM, several students from the school were still outside, and they were afraid to return to school when the cannon fire started. It wasn't until dawn the next day that they were personally escorted back to school by comrades from the army. The students happily said, "This is the best army we've ever seen." When this reporter walked out of the school gate, I saw six or seven students happily scrubbing off the shameless slogans of the Kuomintang on the wall. More than 400 students from Quwo Middle School in the city are building air raid shelters for themselves, preparing for the bombing of Kuomintang airplanes. Zhao Mingliu, the director of studies at the school, along with veteran Jinan educators Zhang Yu Cun and Qiu Zhu Tong, spoke with this reporter about the school's situation and invited this reporter to visit the school's construction. Mr. Zhao said, "Classes can start tomorrow." He also praised the Eighth Route Army's great protection of education and schools. The city's stores began operating yesterday. A clerk from Qingshengyong said, "We haven't done business for a long time, and we've been digging fortifications and carrying earth for Hu-Yan's army. Now we can do some business properly!" Dong Jiufeng repeatedly said, "The business is fair, benevolent, and righteous!" Many merchants sighed and said, "We haven't done good business for a year or two. Now that the Eighth Route Army is here, the market will definitely prosper." (Jinsha)
　　[Report from the Jinan Front, April 24th by this newspaper] (Delayed) After the liberation of Ronghe, the democratic government completely returned more than 4,000 stone of grain that the puppet county magistrate Li Xushou had plundered from the people to the local people. From the 13th, for three days, men, women, old and young people from dozens of miles away came to collect grain. Old Man × of Xie Village, who is over eighty years old, received eight dou of grain. He smiled with surprise and admiration and said, "Old Yan robbed us of our grain, but the Eighth Route Army fought it back for us!" Old Woman × of Panzhuang said, "The Eighth Route Army is a life-saving Bodhisattva. Without the Eighth Route Army, the people would not be able to survive." The people carried the grain and said to the army comrades, "The Eighth Route Army is an honest and upright official." The son of Chen, an old man from Zhang Village, was conscripted into the army, but was liberated by us this time. The neighbors all persuaded him to go home and farm, but the old man refused, saying, "Although I am old and there is no one to take care of me at home, I will let my child join the Eighth Route Army!" The old man repeatedly told his son, "Work hard in the Eighth Route Army and serve the country!"

    荣河群众感谢我军
    【本报太岳前线二十二日电】当记者访问曲沃城内职业中学尹相华校长及谷子安、刘书山等教员时，彼等首先为我述说人民解放军纪律严明、秋毫无犯的情形。他们说：前天下午五时攻城时，该校有几个学生尚在校外，炮声一响就不敢回校，直至第二天天明，被部队同志亲送回校。学生欢喜的说：“这是从来没见过的好队伍。”记者走出该校门口，见六七个学生，正在愉快的洗刷墙上国民党的无耻标语。城内曲沃中学的四百多学生，正为自己构筑防空壕，防备国民党飞机的轰炸。该校教务主任赵鸣琉及晋南老教育家张虞存、仇筑桐与记者畅谈学校情形，并邀记者参观校内建设。赵先生说：“明天就可以开课。”并称赞八路军对教育事业，对学校备加保护。该城商店昨日就开始营业，庆盛永伙计说：“许久没有作买卖，给胡阎军挖工事抬土，现在可以好好作点买卖了！”董久丰连说：“买卖公道，仁义，仁义！”不少商人叹口气说：“已经有一两年没作好买卖，八路军来了，一定能把市面繁荣起来。”（金沙）
    【本报晋南前线二十四日电】（迟到）荣河解放后，民主政府当将伪县长李绪守搜刮老百姓的四千余石粮食，完全归还给当地老百姓。从十三日起，三天内，全县男女老少，从数十里外赶来领粮。谢村八十余岁的×老汉领了八斗粮，他以惊奇钦佩的眼光笑着说：“老阎抢了咱的粮食，八路军给咱打回来了！”盘庄×老太太说：“八路军是救命活菩萨，不是八路军来老百姓可活不下去了。”老百姓扛着粮，见军队同志便说“八路军是青天大老爷。”张村陈老汉的孩子被抓当了兵，这次被我们解放了，邻家们都劝他回家务农老汉却拒绝说：“我虽老了，家中无人侍候，但我叫俺孩当八路军去！”这位老汉还再三嘱咐他的儿子：“在八路军好好干，替国家出力报效！”
