The villages of Yuanqu and Guxin in the Fifth District recently launched a production campaign focused on intensive weeding and sowing, primarily driven by impoverished peasants and hired laborers, despite heavy duties and a shortage of manpower. Due to the heavy duties and lack of labor, most of the masses lacked confidence. As the old man Xing Zhanyuan said: "Every day they call for production, but everyone has gone to the front lines to fight. Who are we supposed to get to farm the land?" Qin Xilai said, "It doesn't matter, the women in our village are still at home. As long as they are mobilized, weeding and sowing will not be a problem." Based on this situation, current affairs education was conducted in the people's schools, raising questions such as "Only by mobilizing women to participate in mutual aid can we succeed" for everyone to discuss. Chen Xuegui said, "I have no objection to having women participate in mutual aid, but they come out every day without saying a word at home, which is really unsatisfactory." An old woman followed up, saying, "What you said is very true. It doesn't matter whether we come out or not, we should all come out in this world, but I don't want to come out if I don't say a word at home and there's no one to do the housework." Then, the chairman of the District Women's Rescue Association made a mobilization speech: "As long as everyone helps each other, if there's any urgent housework, just say a word, and someone will help you." The old woman said, "According to you, if I have urgent housework, someone will do it for me? That's not bad." After returning home, she immediately mobilized her daughter-in-law to participate in mutual aid. When the woman Cui Shuangmei learned about this, she went to mobilize Liu Erhe's mother: "I heard that you have been allocated some land, and you should work hard to produce this year." She said, "This year I was allocated land and food, and I really want to work hard to produce, but I'm old and can't work the land." Cui Shuangmei said, "It doesn't matter, as long as you can join a mutual aid group, you don't have to go to the field, just do the housework." This cleared her mind, "If that's the case, I want to join the mutual aid group. If they don't have clothes, I can sew. I'll sew clothes for them." In this way, Liu Erhe's mother automatically joined the mutual aid group.

After mobilization in the winter school, the Yao Huozhu mutual aid group in First Street went to mobilize eleven women, including Feng Shuzhen, from their group to participate in mutual aid. At this time, the old man Qin Helou said, "The women all have bound feet. If they go to the field to weed the wheat, they will turn the wheat into a threshing ground." The old man Yao Ji said, "Even if women can weed the land, they are not as good as children." Everyone said that women were useless. The women Feng Shuzhen and others were both shy and felt that they were not useful, so they asked the men to carry their hoes, and they secretly went to the field to weed the wheat. At first, they didn't know how to weed, so the men taught them. Later, they all learned how to weed. At first, they were shy, but after weeding for a while, they felt that they could do it. Under the leadership of the woman Feng Shuzhen, they weeded seven and a half mu of wheat in half a day. Yao Yincheng saw the women weeding wheat in the field, keeping up with the men, and shouted at the dinner market, "The women are useful for weeding wheat, some are even faster than men." This boosted the morale of Feng Shuzhen and the other eleven women. The next day, they mobilized fourteen more women, along with five male laborers, and weeded thirty mu of wheat in half a day. When the women Qin Chunzhi and others on Third Street heard that the women on First Street could go to the field to weed wheat, they were very unconvinced. That afternoon, they mobilized fifteen women to go to the field to weed wheat. Labor hero Yao Huozhu automatically went to the field to help the women weed, and they weeded twenty mu of land in half a day. This caused a sensation among the women in the whole village, and they all clamored to join his mutual aid group. Kong Shixiang and Zhao Ling, the directors of the Women's Rescue Association of Second Street, also went to their neighbors without eating to mobilize the women, saying, "The women in First and Third Streets are all going to the field to weed wheat. We are also women, can't we go to the field and try?" This time, thirteen women automatically went to the field to weed wheat, and unanimously said, "First Street is weeding their own land, we guarantee to weed the land for the military families and those participating in the war first, and then weed our own land." As a result, they weeded fifteen mu of wheat land in half a day. Kong Shixiang, the director of the Women's Rescue Association, said, "I used to think that men's work was very difficult, but now I don't think men's work is more difficult than women's." This time, especially the women in each street who had just been liberated, actively colluded and mobilized more than 300 young women in the village to participate in mutual aid groups. Through the women's wheat weeding movement, everyone realized that they "can plant the land without men." Under the slogan "Men fight Lao Jiang at the front, women plow the slopes and sow seeds and weed the wheat seedlings at home," the women alone weeded 2,500 mu of the village's 3,300 mu of wheat land.

　　原曲、固新发动妇女春耕经验
    五区原曲固新两村最近在差务繁重缺乏劳力的情况下，开始了以贫雇为主发动锄苗突击下种的生产运动。由于差务繁重劳力缺乏，大部分群众都没有信心，如邢占元老汉说：“每天号召生产哩，都去前方参战啦，叫谁种地哩。”秦喜来说：“不要紧，咱村妇女都还在家哩，只要动员起来，锄苗下种都不成问题。”根据这种情况，在民校里都进行了时事教育，提出“只有发动妇女参加互助才行”等问题让大家讨论。陈学桂说：“叫妇女参加互助俺也没啥意见，就是每天出来跑，不给家里哼一声，实在不满意。”一个老婆跟着说：“你说这话倒很对，出来不出来吧，倒也没有啥，这个世道都应当出来，就是出来不给俺说，家里放着生活没人做，俺就不愿意。”接着区妇救主席又作了动员“只要大家互助起来，家里有啥紧生活，只用说一句话，就有人打伙给你办”。老婆说：“照你说来，俺有紧生活还能给俺做哩，这倒不歹。”回去后，即把自己媳妇动员参加了互助。妇女崔双梅知道了这个事，即去动员刘二合娘：“听说你分了一些地，今年该好好生产哩。”她说：“今年分了地又分了粮食，很想好好生产吧，就是咱老啦，没法弄地。”崔双梅说：“不要紧，只要你能参加人家互助组，你不用上地就把生活做了。”这一下打通了她的思想，“要是那样，俺可要参加互助哩。他们没有衣裳，俺会缝，我给他们缝衣裳”。就这样刘二合娘即自动参加了互助组。
    一街在冬学里经过动员后，姚火柱互助组，即去动员自己组妇女冯书祯等十一人参加互助。这时老汉秦合楼说：“妇女都是小脚，到地锄麦子，都要把麦子给翻腾成碾场哩。”老汉姚吉说：“妇女也能锄了地，还不如儿童顶事哩。”你一言他一语，都说妇女不顶事。妇女冯书祯等听见又害羞，又觉得自己不顶事，便叫男人背上锄，她们偷偷的都上了地锄麦子。开始都不会锄，由男人教，到后来都学会锄，开始害羞，锄了半天，觉得也能行，就在妇女冯书祯的领导下半天锄了七亩半麦子。姚印成看到妇女在地里锄麦子，也赶上了男人，回来在饭市上吵嚷着，“人家妇女锄麦子就是顶事哩，有的比男人还快”。这一下冯书祯等十一个人更起了劲，第二天又动员了十四个妇女，配合五个男劳力，半天锄了三十亩麦子。第三街妇女秦春枝等听到一街妇女能到地锄麦子，很不服气，当日下午即动员了十五个妇女到地锄麦子，劳动英雄姚火柱自动去地帮助妇女锄，半天锄了二十亩地。这一下全村妇女轰动起来，都吵嚷着参加他的互助组。二街妇救会主任孔世香、赵伶等也顾不上吃饭，就去邻家动员妇女说：“人家一、三街妇女都上地锄麦子，咱也是妇女咱就不能去地试试。”这一下十三个妇女便自动到地去锄麦子，并一致说：“一街锄自己地哩，咱保证先给军属、参战的锄完地，再锄自己地。”结果半天锄了十五亩麦子地，妇救会主任孔世香说：“以前觉得男人生活可难做哩，现在觉得男人生活也不比女人难吧。”这一下特别是各街刚翻了身的妇女，都积极的串通起来，把全村三百多青年妇女都动员参加了互助组。经过妇女锄麦运动，都认识了自己“没男人也能种上地”，全村就在“男人前方打老蒋，妇女在家刨坡下种锄麦秧”的口号下，把全村三千三百亩麦子地，光妇女就锄了两千五百亩。（胜前、兴华、贵昌、学俭、华峰、士元）
