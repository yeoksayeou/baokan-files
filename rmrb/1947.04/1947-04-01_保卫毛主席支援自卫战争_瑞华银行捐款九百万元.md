　　Defend Chairman Mao, Support the Self-Defense War
    Ruihua Bank Donates 9 Million Yuan
    [Report from this newspaper] The privately-owned Ruihua Bank in the border region, in order to defend Chairman Mao and support the self-defense war, has donated 9 million yuan from the bank's surplus public welfare fund from the previous year and a portion of the voluntary savings from bonuses of directors, supervisors, and employees to the front lines. Hu Zhuxuan, the chairman of the bank, also sent a letter to the leading comrades Liu, Deng, Bo, Teng, Zhang, Wang, Yang, and Rong, stating: Since July of last year, Chiang Kai-shek, for the sake of national betrayal and dictatorship, launched a nationwide civil war. The large army under the command of the Kuomintang reactionaries invaded the interior of the border region, wantonly destroying it, causing the people to once again fall into the abyss of war. This has also caused tremendous obstacles to our newly emerging and vigorously developing private banking industry. Fortunately, the soldiers at the front, with their heroic self-defense war, have contained the ferocity of Chiang's army, reversed the war situation, and thus defended the safety of the rear. Moreover, under the leadership and assistance of the democratic governments in various regions, we have still been able to obtain considerable profits. As the bank is convening its second shareholders' meeting on the tenth of this month, the reactionaries have once again invaded Yan'an. All shareholders and employees were filled with indignation upon hearing this and unanimously decided to contribute 4.5 million yuan from the surplus public welfare fund of the previous year, and the directors, supervisors, and employees also voluntarily saved and donated 4.5 million yuan from their due bonuses, totaling 9 million yuan, to the front lines to support the self-defense war. We will also work hard in the future to further support the development of agriculture, industry, and commerce, so that the front and rear can unite and jointly strive to end Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary rule.

　　保卫毛主席支援自卫战争
    瑞华银行捐款九百万元
    【本报讯】边区民营瑞华银行为保卫毛主席支援自卫战争，将该行上年度盈余公益金及董监事职员自愿节约之奖励金各一部共九百万元捐助前线。该行董事长胡竹轩氏并特致函刘、邓、薄、滕、张、王、杨、戎各位首长称：去年七月以来蒋介石为了卖国独裁，发动了全国规模性的内战，国民党反动派所指挥下的大军，侵入了边区内地，肆意破坏，使人民重新陷入战争灾难的深渊，因之也使我们新生的蓬勃发展的私营银行事业遭受到莫大的阻障。幸赖前方将士以英勇的自卫战阻遏了蒋军的凶焰，扭转了战局，从而保卫了后方的安全；并在各地民主政府领导与扶助之下，尚能获得不少利润。值本月十日本行召开第二次股东会议之际，反动派又进犯延安，全体股东职员闻之不胜愤慨，一致决议从上年度盈余公益金中提出四百五十万元，董监事职员也自愿节省从应得之奖励金中捐出四百五十万元，共计五百万元，捐助前线，支援自卫战争。并在今后努力经营，进一步扶助农工商业之发展，前线后方结合起来，为结束蒋介石的反动统治共同奋斗。
