　　Suffering All Kinds of Torture in the Old Society,
    Women Labor to Seek Liberation in the New Society
    The Second District of Heshun Trains Poor and Hired Women to Raise Awareness
    [This newspaper Heshun dispatch] The Second District trained poor and hired women, seeking to mobilize the broad masses of women to thoroughly awaken and stand up. A total of 266 poor and hired women participated in the training. Most of their personal backgrounds involved being wet nurses, cooks, child brides, and famine refugees who had begged for food. Their suffering was greater and more numerous than that of ordinary women.

    Therefore, it began by discussing the lives and status of women in the old society, and then led to systematic grievance airing. Ma Linyu from Nanliyang said: "I was sold by my parents at the age of four, because my husband's family was also penniless, with no food or drink; after marriage, my husband worked as a long-term laborer, and I cooked for the landlord Guo Kuiwen. I was tied to the landlord like this, and I haven't lived with my husband for seven or eight years." As she spoke, she wept bitterly, stirring the hearts of every woman. The leadership immediately put forward the slogan "Speak out all the grievances," and launched a large-scale airing of grievances. More than 140 people spoke, talking about the pain of foot-binding, arranged marriages, child brides, etc. Li Wenhai tearfully recounted that because of an arranged marriage, the man she was married to was 23 years older than her, like her own father, and she still can't get used to it. During this process, the leadership raised questions such as "Who gave the root of suffering? Who is to blame for the pain of foot-binding and being beaten and scolded after being sold to someone else?" turning to tracing the root of suffering. At first, most women thought it was "their parents who loved money and harmed them." But some realized that it was the landlords who caused the suffering. Zhang Xiao'e said: "My parents' home had food, but they were reluctant to sell us." During the debate between these two opinions, the leadership further guided them with questions like "If the poor family had no food in good years, why did the rich have food?" Everyone's thinking then changed, and they unanimously replied that "The rich exploit, and the poor are exploited." From then on, the women drew a clear class line, recognized that the landlords were the root of women's suffering, and that the wives of the poor were all one family, and that the "backward" wives of the poor should also unite and resolutely overthrow the landlords.

    In further discussions, most women raised questions such as: "Even if the landlords are overthrown, women will not be equal to men." For example, Ji Lianhua said: "My man wears new clothes, and I wear rags. A foot of cloth is not enough to patch my pants." Qiao Changlian also said: "When I went to the county for a meeting, I asked my husband for two yuan for food, but he not only didn't give it to me, but also scolded me." The result of everyone's discussion was that "the in-laws are stubborn, and the men are backward," and they unanimously demanded that the in-laws and men be straightened out first. At this time, the leadership immediately put forward the slogan of "turning the corner," "Pick up the five-foot ruler, measure yourself first, then measure others." Encouraging them to examine themselves. Shen Zhonglin took the lead in washing her face and examining herself, saying: "I thought that if women were raised, no one would dare to mess with us. After eating, I would go to other people's houses. My man said something, and I wouldn't listen. The cooperative distributed flowers to promote textile production, but I made lamp wicks out of them all. Thinking about it today, if I am like this, how can others look up to me?" This inspired everyone to reflect. Everyone unanimously recognized that others looked down on them because they had problems and no skills. Like the women of Chenjia Village, they help their men cut artemisia and compost manure, and grind flour during the autumn harvest. Surely no one would dare to say anything. Then, from accounting, everyone knew that "labor has value." Shi Youhua said: "Participating in textile production, there is money to spend." Wang Baie said: "Labor can earn Jinnan currency." The women who received training in each village returned with high morale and set out two-month textile plans. The formerly "backward" women of Nanliyang, after returning from training, convened a meeting of poor women as soon as they finished eating to mobilize them. They first cleaned up the four looms and started working, and reorganized the women's salvation organization, expelling the landlords' wives from the meetings. The women in other villages are also reorganizing their organizations and launching a major textile competition between individuals and individuals, and between groups and groups, striving to complete the hundred-day textile task ahead of schedule.

　　旧社会忍受尽百般残害
    新社会妇女劳动求解放
    和顺二区集训贫雇妇女提高觉悟
    【本报和顺讯】二区集训贫雇妇女，以求发动广大妇女，彻底觉悟翻身。参加集训贫雇妇女共二百六十六人，个人出身大部是奶孩、做饭、童养媳和曾经讨吃要过饭的逃荒难民，她们的痛苦比一般妇女要大要多。
    因此首先便从座谈旧社会妇女的生活与地位着手，然后引向系统的诉苦。南里阳马林鱼说：“我四岁上就被爹娘卖了，因为婆家也是个穷光蛋，没吃喝；结婚后，男人住长工，我给地主郭魁文做饭，就这样被地主拴住，七、八年还没有和男人在一块同居过。”说着痛哭流涕，激动了每个妇女的心。领导上便即时提出“有苦诉尽”的口号，展开了大诉苦，计有一百四十余个人都发了言，谈出的问题主要是缠足、买卖婚姻、童养媳……等痛苦。李文孩哭诉她因为买卖婚姻，寻下个男人就比自己大廿三岁，活像自己个爹，到现在还不扭劲。这当中领导上便提出“苦根是谁给的？缠足受痛，卖给人家受打骂怨谁”等问题，转向追苦根。一开始大部妇女认为是“爹娘爱钱害了自己”。但有的则认识到是地主给的苦。张小娥说：“娘家有吃的，也舍不的卖咱。”这两种意见的争论中，领导上又进一步引导“娘家好年没吃的，老财又为什有吃的”？大家的思想才转过来了，一致意见回答是“财主靠剥削，穷人家是受剥削”。从此妇女划清了阶级界线，认识了地主是妇女的苦根，穷人们的老婆都是一家人，“落后”的穷人老婆也要团结，坚决把地主打垮。
    在继续讨论中大部妇女提出这样问题：“打倒地主，妇女也和男人平等不了”。如冀莲花说：“我男人穿新的，我穿烂的，要一尺布补裤子还不够。”乔长莲也说：“来县开会，向男人要两元菜钱，不但不给，还骂了一顿。”大家扯的结果是“翁婆顽固，男人落后”的过，一致要求先整一下翁婆和男人。此时领导上即提出转弯的口号“拿起五尺，先量自己，再量别人”。启发其检查自己。申种林首先洗脸，检讨出“我认为提高妇女便无人敢惹了，每天吃了饭就串门，男人说一说还不服劲。合作社发给花让纺织生产，我都做了灯捻子。今天想起来，自己是这样，别人怎能看起呢？”这一来启发大家都做了反省。大家一致认识了别人看不起是因为自己有毛病，没本领。象人家陈家庄妇女，帮助男人割蒿沤粪，秋收磨面做活计，一定没人敢说。接着大家从算账中，知道了“劳动就有价值”。史有花说：“参加纺织，就有钱花。”王白娥说：“劳动能成冀南票。”各村受训妇女回去情绪很高，都订出了两个月的纺织计划；过去“落后”的南里阳妇女，训练回去后，吃不完饭就召集贫苦妇女大会做动员，首先把四架织布机收拾起了，开了工，并整顿妇救组织清洗了地主老婆出会；其他村妇女也都在重新整顿组织，展开了个人和个人、小组和小组的纺织大竞赛，争取提前完成百日纺织任务。（印龙）
