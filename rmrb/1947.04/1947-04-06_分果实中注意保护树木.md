　　Protect Trees While Distributing Fruits
    How to protect trees during the distribution of the fruits of the land revolution is a real problem. For example, in Nanpingwang Village, Zanhuang, there are about 500 fruit trees, which have been valued and distributed to the masses. Now the masses are cutting down trees one after another, because most of the trees are growing on other people's land. If they don't cut down the trees, the owners of the land will not agree; those who have been allocated the trees also want to saw them down and use them for firewood. An old man in the village said: "Not only will there be a shortage of timber for construction in the future, but even the saplings will become a problem after all the big trees are cut down!" This is by no means a problem of just one village. I hope everyone will pay attention to it and solve it as soon as possible.

　　分果实中注意保护树木
    处理翻身果实中，如何保护树木，实在是个问题。比如赞皇南平旺村的果实树约五百棵上下，已作价分配给群众。现群众正纷纷砍树，因为绝大部分树是长在别人地界内，不砍树吧，地界的主人不同意；分到树的人，也想锯倒弄柴烧。这村一个老汉说：不只将来建设时缺木料，大树都出倒后，连树秧子都成问题了！这绝不是一个村庄的问题，希望大家注意，并早早解决。
