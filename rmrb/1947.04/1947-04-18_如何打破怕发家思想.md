How to Break the Fear-of-Getting-Rich Ideology
    Lian Yishan

    After the farmer's general training and the county-wide district and village cadres' production mobilization meeting in Heshun, the ideological obstacles of farmers to production and getting rich have been greatly resolved, laying a good foundation for this year's large-scale production campaign. However, it cannot be said that ideological concerns have been completely resolved in some places. For example, Longwang Village, which has a relatively good work record in Heshun, has indeed made progress compared to before after the general training and production mobilization. It is "organized" in form, but after our short half-month of understanding, the ideological obstacles of farmers fearing wealth are still very serious. In the morning and afternoon, no one in the entire village is working. They are either chatting idly on the street or sleeping at home playing with their children. Those who can chop three loads of firewood a day only chop two loads and then rest. The manure that is usually delivered by now has not yet started this year. The original plan was for 60 loads of manure per mu, but now there is still a shortage of 4,716 loads of fertilizer (a shortage of fertilizer for 78 mu and 6 fen of land), and there are no plans to make up for the accumulation. The thinking of the masses in this village, especially the middle-peasant class, is more solidified than that of the emancipated masses, and they do not understand the new policies, so it is not easy to accept them. The ideas of "fear of being harvested like chives, fear of getting a haircut, and fear of standing out" have become more difficult to get through among them. Therefore, they are not at ease in production, and most of them reflect that they are "watching and seeing." Under the command of this kind of thinking, they show a "want to do but dare not do, dare to do but not do much" experimental attitude. For example, Zhao Guiquan said, "One of my livestock cannot cultivate my land, so I have to buy a donkey." He has been constantly telling the masses this, but he does not buy it. He wants to hear what the masses' reaction is to his buying a donkey before making a decision. Later, when he heard someone say it was "stone statues" (idle talk), he dared not buy a donkey. Another is "Will there be struggles in the future? It's not necessarily guaranteed." For example, Li Jiang'er said, "No matter what you say or how you train and get through to my thinking, I have my own idea." (meaning not to develop). This kind of thinking is common among middle peasants, and even some emancipated masses have this idea. Among middle peasants and emancipated masses, there is a common idea in the future development of "not daring to stand out", and they have adopted a "marching in step" method, observing left and right during development to see if they are "standing out". As can be seen from the mutual aid groups in Longwang Village: all classes have mutual aid requirements, but production is lukewarm and lifeless, and no one wants to be a leader. Obviously, the existence of this kind of thinking greatly affects the development in the direction of Wu Manyou and the establishment of his banner. Another example is Village Chief Li Genfu and other cadres who are afraid of being stronger than others and wish that "the masses are richer and they are poorer," so they do not take a step forward in production. Ideologically, there is a phenomenon of hesitation of "wanting to do but daring not to do." The following points are suggested for resolving the above ideas for reference: 1. Let the farmers recall who were struggled against in the past? Why did the masses want to struggle against them? Were the middle peasants who truly started their families through labor affected? Even if individual middle peasants were affected, what were the reasons? Was it an individual problem or a policy problem? 2. How can farmers' ideological exposure not pursue demands, but rather be seen in actual actions, words, life, and production? Study its roots and characteristics, grasp the characteristics to solve it, and let people see it with facts (such as rewarding labor heroes and production model facts). At the same time, mobilize the emancipated farmers to actively unite the middle peasants and get through to their thinking in production. Otherwise, if you just want their thoughts and pursue exposure of their thoughts, they will answer you, "I was afraid in the past, and now I am even more afraid." This is like "a tiger eating the moon," with a mouth but nowhere to start. 3. Mobilize the emancipated farmers to actively develop production and lead the middle peasants with outstanding development, especially starting with cadres is more important. Otherwise, they will think, "If it is daring to develop, why don't the cadres develop?" 4. The government may clearly order the protection of those who start their families through labor, including their human rights, property rights, and land rights. And actively publicize and explain the implementation of the land policy after the land reform and the new production relations.

　　如何打破怕发家思想
    连一山
    和顺经过了农民普训与全县区村干部生产动员大会，农民的生产发家思想障碍，得到了不少的解决，给今年的大生产运动打下了好的基础；但在某些地方还不能说已彻底的解决了思想顾虑。如龙旺村，是和顺工作较好的村子，经过普训与生产动员后，比前的确有了进展，形式上是“组织起来”了，但经过了我们短短的半月了解，农民的怕发财思想障碍目前还很严重。全村群众，在早上和后半晌的时间，没有一个人做活，不是在大街闲谈，便是在家睡着玩孩子，一天能砍三担柴的只砍两担就休息了。常年到现在已送完了粪，今年还没有开始哩。原订计划每亩六十担粪，而现在尚缺肥料四千七百一十六担（缺七十八亩六分地的肥），亦不作计划如何补积，这村的群众思想，中农阶层的思想问题，比之翻身群众较为凝固，对新的政策不了解，故不易接受，“怕割韭菜、怕剃头、怕突出”思想，在他们中成为比较难弄通的。所以生产上不安心，大多数反映是“看着办吧。”在这种思想支使下，表现了“想干不敢干、敢干不大干的试验态度”。如赵贵全说：“我一个牲口种不了我的土地，还得买个驴。”他只是在一直的向群众说，但不买，他是想听群众对他买驴有什么反映，再作决定。以后听到有人说是“石头对像”（谈闲话）便不敢买驴了。另一种是“今后是否还斗呢？不一定保险”。如李江儿说：“不管你说啥，如何训练，打通思想，反正我有一个主义。”（意思是不发展）这种思想在中农中为数不少，甚至部分翻身群众亦有此想法。在中农与翻身群众中，对今后的发展上，普遍的思想存在“不敢突出”，采取了“齐步并进”的办法，发展中左右观照，看自己是否“突出”了。如龙旺村的互助组可看出：各阶层有互助要求，但生产都是冷冷淡淡的没劲头，谁也不愿当带头者。很明显这种思想的存在，大大的影响了吴满有方向的发展及其旗帜的树立。又如村长李根福等干部怕自己比别人强，愿“群众富些，自己穷些”，故在生产上不往前面走一步。思想上是“想干不敢干”的徘徊现象。对解决以上各种思想，有以下几点意见，提出供参考：一、让农民回忆历年来被斗的是那些人？为什么群众要斗他？真正的劳动起家中农是否受了影响？纵然有个别中农受到一些影响，又是什么原因？是个别人的问题呢？还是政策呢？二、农民的思想暴露，不是追求讨要，应是在实际行动、言论、生活、生产各方面的表现中看如何？研究其根源及特点，抓着特点给予解决，并以事实让看（如奖励劳动英雄，生产模范事实），同时发动翻身农民主动的团结中农，在生产中打通其思想。否则，只和他要思想，追求暴露思想，他便回答你“过去害怕来，现在可怕啦。”这样给了个“老虎吃月亮”，有口无处下。三、发动翻身农民积极的发展生产，突出的发展来带动中农，特别先从干部做起更重要，否则他们认为“如果敢发展，人家干部们为啥不发展？四、政府可明令保障劳动发家者，人权、财权、地权。并积极的宣传解释土地改革后的土地政策执行与新的生产关系。
