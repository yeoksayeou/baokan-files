　　Soaring Prices and Widespread Poverty in the Chiang-Controlled Areas
  　Price Hikes Continue Unabated in the Chiang Areas
    Market Order Further Collapses
    [Report from this newspaper] According to materials from various sources, after the Kuomintang government issued the "Economic Emergency Measures," prices in various areas of the region continued to rise unabated, the market situation was bleak, and there were black market transactions for cotton, grain, and gold, speculation in securities intensified, and gold banknotes flowed out of the country. A recent visitor from Tianjin said about prices there: "The market prices only stabilized for a few days before and after the promulgation of the 'Economic Emergency Measures,' and then secretly became active again. The most volatile items are grain, and the fluctuations in gold are even greater." Comparing the prices in Shijiazhuang on February 18th and March 7th, all general daily necessities and cotton and grain have risen except for mountain products. "Xianlu" brand cloth rose from 17,000 yuan to 22,000 yuan per bolt. In late February, the official price of white flour was 1,100 yuan per catty, but the black market price was 1,700 yuan. Comparing the prices in Anyang on February 14th and March 9th, wheat rose from 500 yuan to 650 yuan per catty, sea salt rose from 1,200 yuan to 1,500 yuan, and homespun cloth rose from 750 yuan to 1,800 yuan. Regarding Jinan, since the implementation of the "Emergency Measures," even the Central News Agency has not dared to deny the soaring prices of various goods. Especially after our victory in Laiwu and the destruction of the Jiaoji Railway, the enemy and puppets in the area were extremely panicked. In order to curb the soaring prices, the banks even stopped and withdrew loans, and remittances were also suspended. Five or six merchants who were considered to have raised prices were shot, but the rising trend of prices could not be stopped.
    The bleak market situation can be exemplified by Shijiazhuang: By the end of February, in addition to a small number of large merchants who fled to Tianjin out of fear, more than 300 small and medium-sized merchants had requested to close their businesses due to losses; however, many merchants did not even have the freedom to close their businesses under the official mandatory opening order, so some had to abandon their businesses and flee, some posted "Goods sold out, clearing accounts," and others gradually concealed their goods. (Note: The area began to forcibly register inventory and set official prices in December of last year, and has recently intensified this practice; according to reliable information, most of the goods have flowed into black market transactions.)
    Although the Kuomintang government officially set the gold price at 480,000 yuan, the actual prices varied across regions, as every so-called official bank wanted to take advantage of the situation and exploit the people with special privileges. Black market prices in various places were half to one times higher than the official price; in Tianjin, on the third day after the "Plan" was promulgated (February 19th), the Dagong Daily revealed that the black market price was 700,000 yuan; at the end of February, it had reached 800,000 yuan. In order to block black market transactions, the Kuomintang government confiscated 170 kilograms of gold and detained 26 gold "runners" in the area alone, but the effect was still minimal. At the end of February, the black market price in Taiyuan was 820,000 yuan, in Yuci it was 860,000 yuan, and silver dollars were 7,000 yuan. In mid-March, the black market price of gold in Shijiazhuang was 650,000 yuan, and silver dollars were 6,300 yuan.
    Due to the prohibition of gold transactions and the tightening of price controls, gold speculators who controlled a large amount of floating capital temporarily felt troubled. Therefore, speculators with powerful backgrounds in Tianjin and other places have airlifted large quantities of gold abroad, and another part is shifting to the stock market. The Central News Agency revealed that in March, the Shanghai stock market experienced violent fluctuations, and the stocks of Yongxing Banknote Factory rose wildly. Although economic inspectors were present to monitor the situation, it was ineffective, and the police and social bureaus took joint action, but the order was still extremely chaotic. The continued serious development of this phenomenon is foreseeable.

### 蒋管区物价猛烈上涨民生凋敝　蒋区物价狂涨不已  市场秩序更陷紊乱

　　蒋管区物价猛烈上涨民生凋敝
  　蒋区物价狂涨不已
    市场秩序更陷紊乱
    【本报讯】据各方材料证明，国民党颁布“经济紧措”后，该区各地物价续涨不已，市况萧条，棉粮黄金都有了黑市交易，证券投机加剧，金钞外流。天津物价据最近该地来人谈：“经济紧措颁布前后，市场物价只稳定几天，紧接着又暗中活跃起来，比较波动的是粮食，金子变动则更大。”石门物价若以二月十八日和三月七日相较，除山货外，一般日用品和棉粮全都上涨。“仙鹿”市布每匹由一万七千元涨至二万二千元，二月下旬白面官定价每斤一千一百元，黑市却为一千七百元。安阳物价若以二月十四日和三月九日相较，麦子一斤由五百元涨至六百五十元，海盐由一千二百涨至一千五百，土布由七百五涨至一千八。济南方面自“紧措”实行后迄今，连中央社都不敢否认各货价格飞涨，特别在我莱芜大捷及胶济路被破坏以后，该地敌伪恐慌莫名，为抑止飞涨之物价，银行甚至停止并收回贷款，汇兑亦暂停，枪毙了五六个被认为抬高物价的商人，但物价涨势仍未能制止。
    市场萧条情况可以石门为例证：至二月底，该地除一部分大商人因为恐怖逃往天津外，中小商人因赔钱而要求歇业者已达三百多户；但很多商户在官方强制开市下连歇业自由都没有，因此有些只好弃业而逃，有些贴着“货物卖尽、清理账目”，还有的把货物逐渐隐蔽起来。（按：该地从去年十二月就开始强制登记存货定官价，最近更变本加厉；据确讯，各货已多流入黑市交易。）
    国民党虽官定黄金牌价四十八万元，但实际各地并未一致，因每一个所谓官方银行都想趁空子，借特权敲榨人民。各地黑市价均高出牌价半倍至一倍；天津在“方案”颁布后第三日（二月十九日），大公报即透露黑市为七十万元；二月底讯，已达八十万元。国民党为封锁黑市交易，仅在该地已没收一百七十斤黄金，扣压黄金“跑合”二十六人，但效果仍微。太原二月底黑市八十二万元，榆次八十六万元，银元七千元，石门三月中旬黄金黑市六十五万元，银元六千三百元。
    由于黄金交易被禁止及物价管制加严，使掌握大量游资之黄金投机者暂时感受困扰，因此天津等地有权威后台之投机者，已将黄金大批空运国外，另一部分正向证券市场转移。中央社曾透露，三月间上海证券市场发生剧烈波动，永兴钞厂股票疯狂上涨，经济检查人员虽在场监视亦失效，后警局社会局联合行动秩序仍极紊乱。此现象之继续严重发展是可以预料的。
