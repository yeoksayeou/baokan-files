　　[Report from this newspaper in Xiyang] Since the farmer training class in the Eighth District, the seven administrative villages around the Jia Village base point have all taken action. After class division, new feudal vestiges were discovered. Each of the four villages including Xiyukou and Xiangyuhe discovered three households concealing unliquidated vestiges. Now the in-depth movement has been launched. The development of the movement in the past half month is reported as follows:
    After changing the work style of cadres and improving the relationship between cadres and the masses, the prestige of cadres has been greatly improved in the practical action of returning fruits, and mass support has been regained. For example, after the cadres of Zhuangwo made self-criticism to the masses, the public security officer returned three mu of good land, and the political director returned two *shi* of millet. After the cadres of Xiangyugou made self-criticism, they returned ten sheep, seventy or eighty trees, and two mu of land. From then on, the masses dared to speak, and then struggled against the landlord for one hundred and twenty silver dollars and ten silver ingots. East and West Wangchuan and Zhuangwo also organized joint struggles. Before the struggle, when checking the emancipation, it was closely combined with the interests of each individual. The village cadres saw who lacked what and what was short, and let them report it, and then asked: Why don't you have these things? Or have you been in contact with them? By remembering their own things, they will be guided to trace the roots of poverty and complain about their suffering. Jia Wuhaizi of West Wuchuan said: "My father borrowed two hundred yuan, plus five percent interest, with an annual interest of one hundred yuan. The landlord mortgaged two *mu* of hemp land. Because he couldn't pay enough interest for two years, he lost the land, and he also took away my donkey." This speech aroused everyone's anger, and they all recalled their own suffering. Yang Hu, an old man of fifty, said: "In the past, we were 'thin horses with long hair and deep eye sockets, and no one listened to the poor'. Like earthworms, we were very soft, but today we have a backer (the Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army), and we must stand up and turn ourselves over." Then we discussed what to do. Everyone agreed that we can only unite to fight and fill our poor holes. Under such circumstances, some "backward" masses entered the struggle. This time, East Wangchuan used the method of combined struggle and taking to distribute the fruits; investigation and distribution were carried out in advance, and people without clothes, food, or agricultural tools were checked out first. After research by the masses, they approved the distribution of what they lacked, and then divided into several groups, led by cadres, to go to the target's home to demand accounts of blood and sweat, and mobilized the peasants to fight while taking. Some peasants pointed to the torn clothes they were wearing and reasoned with the landlords, and then took them off and put on the landlords' clothes; the distribution of grain was even more determined. The original plan was to have more than ten *shi* of grain, but after deducting thirty-one households with ninety-five people, with an average of two *dou* per person, there were still twelve *shi* left. At this time, they also seized the landlord's unexposed assets and reasoned with them, making the landlord speechless, and the peasants' emotions were even higher. (Xiyang Mass Small Newspaper)

　　干部坚退多得果实
    更加取得群众拥护
    昔阳贾庄基点干群团结查封建
    【本报昔阳讯】八区自农民训练班以后，贾庄基点周围七个行政村都已行动起来。经过划分阶级，又发现新的封建尾巴，西峪口、巷峪河等四村各发现隐蔽未清算的尾巴三户，现深入运动已开展，兹将半月来运动发展情况报导如下：
    经过转变干部作风、改善干群关系后，在退果实的实际行动中，干部威信大大提高，重新取得群众拥护。如庄窝干部向群众检讨后，公安员退出三亩好地，政治主任退小米两石；巷峪沟干部检讨后退出羊十只、树七、八十棵，地二亩。群众从此即敢说话，接着便向地主斗出银洋百二十元、元宝十个。东西王川、庄窝更组织了联合斗争。斗争前检查翻身时，紧紧结合各个人的利益，村干看谁缺什么短什么都让报出来，然后提出：你为什么没有这些东西？还是你有来往那里去啦？由想起他自己的东西，就会引导他追穷根、诉苦。西五川贾五孩说：“我父揭钱二百元，加五利，每年利洋一百元，地主押麻地二亩，因两年付不够利，将地丢了不算，还拉了我一头毛驴”。这个发言，引起了大家的火气，都回想起自己的苦来。最后一个五十岁的老汉杨虎说：“咱过去是‘马瘦毛长皮眼深，穷汉说话没人听’。像蚯蚓打能能，腰软得很，今天有了靠山（共产党八路军），咱们要立起来翻身”。接着讨论怎干，大家一致意见是只有团结起来斗争，填咱的穷窟窿。在这种情况下，有一部分“落后”群众进入了斗争。东王川这次分果实是用连斗带拿的办法；事先进行调查与分配，先检出无衣无食无农具的人来，经群众研究，批准了他分配所缺的东西，然后分几个组，由干部带领到对象家里要血汗账，发动农民一面斗一面拿。有些农民指自己穿的破衣服给地主讲理，然后脱下来换穿了地主的衣服；分粮食的拿粮，表现更坚决。原计划有十几石粮食，结果除三十一户九十五口人，每人平均二斗外，尚余十二石。在这时并抓住地主未暴露的资财，进行讲理，使地主有口无辩，农民情绪也更高。（昔阳大众小报）
