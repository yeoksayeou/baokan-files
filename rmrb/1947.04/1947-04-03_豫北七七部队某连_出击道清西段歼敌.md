    [Report from the Yubei Front, 29th of this month] On the night of the 24th of this month, a certain company of our 77th Unit operated in the western section of the Daqing Railway, and in one fell swoop resolved the Jiang-puppet district public office of Xiwangtai, capturing 14 personnel including the puppet district chief and deputy leader. On the 25th, two battalions of Jiang's troops from Qinyang city, with two heavy cannons and two heavy machine guns, launched an attack in an attempt to retaliate. They were repelled by our company, with over ten enemies killed or wounded, including a platoon leader. On the 26th, the Jiang's troops attacked again, but were also repelled, with another ten-plus enemies killed or wounded. On the 27th, the enemy, still unwilling to give up, launched another attack with two and a half battalions, and declared: "If we don't defeat the 'bandit troops' this time, we won't come out again, and just defend the city." But the result was still that our company beat them back in a panic, and they closed the city gates and dared not come out again. Our company fought four battles in four days and won every time, killing or wounding more than thirty Jiang-puppet personnel below the company commander level. We only suffered nine casualties.

　　豫北七七部队某连
    出击道清西段歼敌
    【本报豫北前线二十九日电】（迟到）本月二十四日夜，我七七部队某连活动于道清路西段，一举将西王台蒋伪区公所解决，俘伪区长大队副以下十四名。二十五日，沁阳城蒋军两个营，摧重炮两门，重机枪两挺出犯企图报复，当被我该连击退，毙伤排长以下十余名。二十六日蒋军复出犯，亦被击退，又毙伤敌十余人。二十七日敌仍不死心，再用两个半营的兵力向我进犯，并扬言：“这次打不胜‘匪军’，再不出来，干脆守城。”但结果还是被我该连打得狼狈而回，闭住城门不敢再出。我某连四天四战四捷，共毙伤蒋伪连长以下三十余人，我仅伤亡九名。
