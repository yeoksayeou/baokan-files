　　Northeast Government Committee Issues Instructions
    Make an All-Out Effort for Spring Plowing
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 16th] The Northeast Government Committee recently issued instructions to governments at all levels in Northeast China, pointing out that the current focus should be on spring plowing, making an all-out effort to help farmers, solve difficulties, not miss the farming season, and quickly plant the land. In areas where land reform is not thorough, personnel should be dispatched urgently to determine land boundaries and land rights, at least to ensure that whoever plants the land harvests the crops. This year, the government has decided to reduce the total amount of public grain in Northeast China by 10 percent. After the farmers have been allocated land, they should work hard to produce and become prosperous. In marginal areas, it is necessary to promote the combination of labor and military affairs, and link production with land reform. The instructions also called on all agencies and troops to immediately start their own production and help the masses with production, creating a mass production upsurge.

　　东北政委会发出指示
    全力突击春耕
    【新华社东北十六日电】东北政委会日前对东北各地政府发出指示，指出当前应以春耕为中心突击工作，全力帮助农民，解决困难，不违农时，迅速将地种上。在土地改革不彻底的地方，应急速派人确定地界和地权，至少要保证谁种谁收。今年政府决定全东北公粮总额减少百分之十，农民分得土地后，应当努力生产，发家致富。在边缘区，则应提倡劳武结合，使生产与土地改革联系起来。该指示并号召各机关部队，应立即动手自己生产，并帮助群众生产，造成群众性的生产热潮。
