Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 9th. According to a United Press report from Nanjing on the 7th, letters smuggled out of Taiwan and arriving in Nanjing stated that the Chiang government is continuing to bloodbath Taiwan; in the midst of rampant extortion and killing, at least another 5,000 Taiwanese have been killed. The letters stated that after the "mainland"-sent Kuomintang army's bloodbath ended on March 18th, Chen Yi's troops, police, and secret agents began to act again, extorting huge sums of money from wealthy Taiwanese households who survived the massacre and escaped collective arrest, on the charge of "colluding with rioters." The letters revealed that Chen Yi also ordered all government officials and "mainland" Chinese to report their losses of life and property suffered during the riots, in order to provide "compensation." It was also stated that "mainland" officials are responding to the government's order with fabricated demands and concocted losses, profiting themselves in the process. The letters also confirmed the report by J.B. Powell, editor of the "China Weekly Review," that Chen Yi, when waiting for the troops to arrive, had broadcast to the Taiwanese people on March 3rd, promising many reforms in order to calm them down. However, as soon as the troops arrived, Chen Yi broke all promises and began a reign of terror. The letters stated that Chen Yi's secret agents participated in the meeting of the "Incident Resolution Committee" held on March 7th, forcing the passage of several provocative demands in order to create an excuse for Chen Yi's bloodbath.
Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 4th. According to recent reports in Shanghai newspapers, farmers in Suzhou are rising up to resist rent collection. In February, more than a hundred farmers in Taipingqiao Township of the county, in order to resist rent collection, smashed a certain rent collection sub-office and injured the director; the county security team's gunfire suppression was ineffective and instead three members were injured. On the 25th of the same month, more than a hundred farmers in Nanbeiqiao Township of the county also resisted rent, completely destroying all of the township's rent collection sub-office. It is reported that similar incidents occurred in the area last year as well.

　　蒋介石继续血洗台湾
    台胞又有五千被杀
    【新华社陕北九日电】据合众社南京七日电称：从台湾偷运出来到达南京的信件称，蒋政府继续血洗台湾；在敲诈勒索肆行杀戮中，至少又有五千台湾人被杀。信件称：在“大陆”派去的国民党军的血洗于三月十八日结束后，陈仪部下的军警宪又开始行动，向屠杀中残存下来并逃掉集体逮捕的台湾富户勒索巨款，罪名是“与暴动者勾通”。信件透露：陈仪并命令所有政府官员与“大陆”华人，报告他们在暴动中遭受之生命财产损失，以便“赔偿”。又称：“大陆”官员以假造的要求与捏造的损失来响应政府命令，从中渔利自肥。信件并证实“密勒士评论报”主笔鲍威尔之报导，即陈仪当等待部队到达时，曾于三月三日向台人广播、允许进行许多改革，以便他们镇静下来。但部队甫一到达，陈仪即毁弃所有诺言，开始恐怖统治。信件称：陈仪的特务分子参加“事件解决委员会”三月七日举行的会议，迫使通过若干挑衅性的要求，以便为陈仪之血洗制造借口。
    【新华社华中四日电】据最近沪报载称：苏州农民群起反抗缴租。二月间，该县太平桥镇百余农民，为反抗催租捣毁某收租分处，并殴伤主任；县保安队鸣枪镇压无效，反被打伤三名。同月二十五日，该县南北桥镇亦有百余农民抗租，将该镇收租分处全部捣毁。按该地去年亦曾有同样事件发生。
