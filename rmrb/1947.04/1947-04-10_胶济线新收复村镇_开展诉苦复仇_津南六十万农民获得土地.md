　　New Recovered Villages and Towns Along the Jiaoji Railway
  　Carry Out Land Reform
  　600,000 Farmers in Southern Tianjin Gain Land
    [Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 8th] Masses in Zhangdian, Weinan (south of Weixian), and other areas along the Jiaoji Railway that have been re-liberated have established liquidation committees and launched revenge movements. On March 16th, more than 1,000 people from twelve villages, including Honggou in Zhangdian, publicly tried and executed Meng Xianjun, the village chief who committed all kinds of evil during the occupation by the Chiang Kai-shek troops. They established farmers' associations and distributed land seized by the Japanese puppets, Chiang's forces, and local despots. The masses in each village have been denouncing the crimes of the Chiang Kai-shek troops. Since the Chiang Kai-shek troops occupied Weinan last autumn, according to incomplete statistics, over 400 people in Weinan have been brutally murdered by Chiang Kai-shek's puppet agents. In Muwei Village of the county, when Chiang's troops beheaded an innocent farmer, they also forced more than forty ordinary people to kneel around as witnesses. The Chiang troops first chopped off the farmer's hands, feet, and ears, and then cut off his head before slicing his body into eight pieces, causing all forty-odd witnesses to faint on the spot. The liberated masses, recalling the blood debts and deep hatred, have vowed to never coexist with the Chiang bandits under the same sky.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Jin察冀, 8th] In the liberated area of Jinghai County, more than a hundred miles south of Tianjin, the policy of "land to the tiller" has been initially realized amidst the intense struggle against encroachment. According to statistics from eighty-one villages, farmers have gained over 42,000 mu of land in this land reform movement. Through this movement, the struggle against encroachment has extended to the suburbs of Jinghai City and along the Jinpu Railway. More than twenty villages and towns along both banks of the Grand Canal have been re-liberated during this movement.
