　　Xinhua News Agency, Jinji Luyu, 4th: The People's Liberation Army, in its counter-offensive operation in the central section of the Pinghan Railway, has annihilated 5,000 enemy troops and recovered five cities. The Field Headquarters of the Jinji Luyu Military Region announced the battle results for the week of March 25th to April 1st: (1) Recovered the five county towns of Puyang, Fengqiu, Yanjin, Yangwu, and Yuanwu, as well as dozens of strongholds; Liberated the vast rural areas south of Puyang, Hua County, and Ji County, north of the Yellow River, spanning 200 li horizontally and 150 li vertically. (2) Controlled over 100 li of the railway line south of Yigou and north of Xinxiang, cutting off the section of the railway from Xinxiang to the Yellow River Bridge. (3) Killed or wounded over 3,000 Chiang Kai-shek puppet soldiers, captured over 2,000 alive, and the captured materials are currently being inventoried. The Chiang Kai-shek troops in northern Henan are extremely panicked, hurriedly mobilizing the only reserve forces on the south bank of the Yellow River, the 66th Division and the 9th Division, a total of six brigades, for reinforcements, but still cannot save their precarious situation in northern Henan. The enemy has a total of twenty brigades in northern Henan, with nineteen brigades currently trapped in seven strongholds including Xinxiang, Ji County, Hua County, Changyuan, the Yellow River Bridge, and Jiaozuo, and the rest are garrisoned by local Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops. Vast rural areas on both sides of the Daoqing and Pinghan Railways have been recovered by us. This situation has created a good opportunity for the People's Liberation Army to annihilate the enemy on a large scale in the future.
    Xinhua News Agency, Jinji Luyu, 4th: The People's Liberation Army, under the command of General Liu Bocheng, recovered Puyang City at 4 PM on the 1st. The defeated enemy's 47th Division fled westward in a disorganized manner, and the People's Liberation Army is currently in pursuit. Over 10,000 rounds of artillery shells were captured in this battle.
    Xinhua News Agency, Jinji Luyu, 6th: The Field Headquarters of the Jinji Luyu Military Region issued Supplementary Communiqué No. 2, stating that from March 25th to April 2nd, our army killed, wounded, and captured over 5,400 Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops, including parts of the General's 9th Division 76th Brigade, 41st Division 120th Brigade, 32nd Division, 66th Division, and 49th Brigade Rapid Column; one battalion of Zhang Mingqing's "Henan People's Self-Defense General Team" and troops of the puppet army Li Ying, and "Homecoming Corps" from various counties, etc. Captured weapons: one intact tank, five mortars, twenty-three American-made light and heavy machine guns, two thousand three hundred and ten rifles, over 10,000 artillery shells, shot down one Chiang Kai-shek plane, and obtained countless other spoils of war.
