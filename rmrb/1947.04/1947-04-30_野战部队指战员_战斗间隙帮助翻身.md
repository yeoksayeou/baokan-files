Our field army helps the masses distribute land and turn themselves over in the intervals between battles. Deputy Director Chen of Unit 668 always makes sure to talk to grassroots people wherever he goes, no matter how busy he is. When marching to ××× Village in × County this time, Deputy Director Chen asked the landlord to come over and understand the situation as soon as he entered the village to rest. From the conversation, he found that there were problems with the work in the village. At this time, although he was extremely tired due to his busy work, he still found the head of the militia to talk to him. At the beginning of the conversation, the head of the militia sighed. Deputy Director Chen expressed his firm support for him. The head of the militia turned around and asked: What kind of cadre are you? Can you make the decision? Deputy Director Chen answered him with certainty, and he recounted everything one by one. Wu Meng'en was a local big tyrant who had been a traitorous village chief for several years and had committed several murders. Hanging and extortion were commonplace. In the famine year, the head of the militia went to his land to pick up sorghum and was falsely accused of being a bandit and detained in prison. In the end, he sold all his family property to redeem his life, and now he is still all-powerful. After Deputy Director Chen understood the situation, he immediately reported it to the local political and civilian organs and got it resolved. Rao Shan's unit of the 101st Regiment of the 106th Army was stationed in ××× Village. Because of the large consumption of firewood and food, the masses were dissatisfied and timid towards the troops. The village dared not distribute 10,000 jin of fruit after the struggle and hoped that we would leave. Later, Instructor Lü convened a village cadre meeting, expressed his firm support, sent cadres to participate in the distribution of grain, and sent a squad to serve as guard, recovering a cart of grain that the landlord had secretly transported away. The masses were greatly moved and raised comfort items to comfort the troops. When the Second Battalion of the 210th Regiment was reorganizing in ××, the battalion first held a military-civilian cadre meeting to exchange opinions and resolved the problem of excessive burden of firewood and food in the village. When the masses were mobilized for land reform, all the landlord's houses where the battalion was stationed were moved out, which greatly facilitated the masses, and the relationship between the military and the people became closer. The chairman of the Women's Rescue Association led more than 30 women to make more than 30 pairs of socks and sew and repair more than 70 pieces of clothing for the army.

　　野战部队指战员
    战斗间隙帮助翻身
    【本报讯】我野战军在战斗间隙中，帮助群众分田翻身。六六八部队陈副主任，每到一地再忙也要找基本群众谈话。此次行军到×县×××村时，陈副主任刚进村休息下来，就把房东请来了解情况，从谈话中，发现该村工作有毛病。这时，他虽因工作繁忙而精神极度疲劳，但仍从繁忙中找自卫队长谈话。谈话开始，自卫队长咳声叹气，陈副主任表示坚决给他撑腰，自卫队长回头发问：你是啥干部？能作主吗？陈副主任以肯定口吻回答了他，他才一一申诉出来。吴孟恩是当地大恶霸，当过几年汉奸庄长，杀人案子有好几件，吊打、讹诈更是常事。灾荒年，自卫队长去他地拾高粱，被诬为土匪扣押入监，结果还是把家产卖尽才赎回性命，现在仍然是一手遮天。陈副主任了解情况后，当将情况反映当地政民机关，获得解决。一○六部队一○一一部饶山部驻×××村，因烧柴吃粮消耗大，群众对部队不满而且畏缩。村里斗争一万斤果实，也不敢分，盼望我们走。后来，吕教导员召开了一个村干会，表示坚决撑腰，并派干部参加分粮食，并派一个班去担任警戒，追回地主偷偷运走的一车粮食，群众大为感动，筹集慰劳品慰劳部队。二一○部队二营在××整军时，该营首先开了一个军民干部会，互相交换意见，解决了本村烧柴吃粮负担过重的问题。当群众动员进行土地改革时，全营所驻地主房屋一律移出，给群众很大方便，军民关系亦加密切；妇救会长领导三十多个妇女给军队做袜三十多双，缝修衣裤七十多件。
