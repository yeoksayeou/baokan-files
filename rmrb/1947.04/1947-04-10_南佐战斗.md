　　The Battle of Nanzuo
    Song Jiebing
    "A hurricane on the plain, yellow sand sweeping the sky," is a local saying from where we were stationed, describing the violent sandstorms. In such a fierce wind and sand, the fighters of the Huaihe Detachment rushed to the front line to kill the enemy.
    "The Kuomintang troops are burning, killing, looting, and raping in our liberated areas..." This news aroused extreme hatred among the soldiers, who clenched their fists tightly, determined to give the Chiang family's Third Army a "punch in the nose."
    Along the way, the soldiers saw the "Nationalist troops" and the traitor Wei Yonghe's forces forcing the peaceful people of the liberated areas to flee. From our positions, we watched as villages in the Jinliangchuan to Xianwengzhai and Fenglongshan foothills, across several major rivers, were engulfed in flames. Not a single soldier failed to denounce the crimes and atrocities of the traitors.
    Several enemy forces converged on Nanzuo Town. When our Twelfth Squad was less than ten meters away from the enemy, the desperate Kuomintang troops, wielding Zhongzheng rifles, counterattacked us. Five of them came up first, and our machine gunner, Comrade Wu Fuyuan, immediately swept down four of them. In the fierce battle, Squad Leader Chi Guilin, despite being wounded, remained at his post, calmly directing the troops to advance. Comrade Lü Xianmin, also wounded, insisted on carrying other wounded comrades off the front line. Squad Leader Guo Chengben, despite being ill, fought the enemy while also transferring wounded comrades. Even when he was exhausted under the artillery fire, he still carried a seriously wounded signalman, Comrade Li Si, off the front line. Finally, when he was dizzy with exhaustion, a branch committee member, Comrade Liu Jinyu, had to support him and take him down. Comrade Du Ping had both legs broken, but he lay on the position, preparing three hand grenades. He intended that if the enemy ever pounced on him, he would first give them two, and then use the one he was holding in his mouth to die together with them. The fierce battle lasted from ten in the morning until about five in the afternoon. Thanks to the bravery of the comrades, the thousands of enemies who converged in Nanzuo had no choice but to retreat along a path of blood.
    After the battle, the Huaihe Detachment was honored with commendations from the leaders of the military sub-district.

　　南佐战斗
    宋介冰
    “平地飓风黄砂卷天”，这是我们驻地老乡形容狂风天色的俗话，在这样暴烈的风砂中，槐河部的战士们奔赴杀敌前线。
    “顽军来我们解放区烧杀掠奸……”这个消息在战士中激起了极度的仇恨，都紧紧的握好了拳头，要痛痛的给蒋家第三军一个“鼻迎拳”。
    战士们沿途看到“国军”和汉奸魏永合的队伍逼得解放区的和平人民逃难，我们在阵地上望＠着，从金良川到仙翁寨凤龙山麓，数道大川的村落在烧着大火，没有一个战士不痛骂卖国贼的罪恶和暴行。
    数路的敌人在南佐镇会合了。当我们十二队距敌离人不到十多米的时候，狼狈的顽军，端着中正式向我们反扑，首先上来五个，这一下子我们的机枪射手吴福元同志就扫倒了他四个。在激烈的战斗中排长池贵林同志，手上带了彩不下火线，沈着指挥部队前进。吕先民同志带了彩还要背别的彩号下火线。班长郭成本同志，一方面带病打敌人，一方面还转撤负伤同志，直到他在炮火下精力疲尽，还要把一个带了重彩的通讯员李四同志背下火线，最后他累得头晕目眩时，才被一位支部委员刘金玉同志把他架下来。杜平同志的两足被打断，他躺在阵地上，准备了三个手榴弹，等敌人万一扑到他身跟前时，先给他们两个吃，再用嘴里咬着这一个和他们同归于尽。激烈的战斗从上午十时打到下午五时许，由于同志们的英勇使这次在南佐会合的数千多敌人，不得不沿着血路踉跄败退。
    战斗结束后，槐河部队荣受了分区首长的嘉奖。
