　　Deepening Mass Movement in the Taiyue Region
  　Landlords and Destitute Peasants Generally Eliminated, Most Poor Peasants Rise to Middle Peasants
    [This newspaper's Taiyue dispatch, 7th] With the exception of Anze County, where land reform is being vigorously carried out, land reform in the remaining eleven counties of the Taiyue region (Qin County, Qinyuan, Tunliu, Changzi, Gaoping, Tumin, Qinshui, Yangcheng, Jincheng, Wangwu, Jiyuan) is nearing completion. Landlords and destitute peasants have generally been eliminated, and more than 80 percent of poor peasants have risen in status. In Tunliu, 89 percent of poor peasants have risen to become middle peasants and rich peasants. In Qinshui, over 90 percent of poor peasants have risen in status. In the aforementioned counties, peasants have recovered 640,000 mu of land (Qinyuan data missing) and 140,000 rooms (Qinyuan and Tunliu data missing) from feudal forces. 500,000 peasants have obtained land, completely transforming the rural landscape, and the people have truly become masters of society. However, the following remaining issues need to be resolved: 1. Cadres and activists obtaining excessive or unfairly cheap fruits of labor, affecting the thorough completion of land reform. In some areas, a partial return has begun under the slogan of "One person turns over, everyone turns over," but many counties have not yet done so properly. 2. In some areas, there are still hidden feudal remnants, either protected by cadres or not completely eradicated due to insufficient mass mobilization. 3. Some areas still have backward villages and "dead corners" that need to be further eliminated. 4. In some areas, there is insufficient unity among middle peasants, and they have not dispelled their concerns about being struggled against, which affects production.

　　太岳腹地群运深入
  　赤贫地主一般消灭贫农大部上升中农
    【本报太岳七日电】太岳腹地的土地改革，除安泽一县正在大力进行外，其余十一县（沁县、沁源、屯留、长子、高平、土敏、沁水、阳城、晋城、王屋、济源）均已接近完成。地主与赤贫一般消灭，贫农百分之八十以上上升。屯留贫农百分之八十九上升为中农、富农。沁水贫农百分之九十以上上升。上述各县，农民从封建势力手中收回土地六十四万亩（缺沁源），房十四万间（缺沁源、屯留）。五十万农民获得土地，农村面貌完全改观，人民真正成为社会主人。但尚有如下遗留问题需要解决：一、干部积极分子多得与贱买果实，影响土地改革的彻底完成。有的地区在“一人翻身、大家翻身”口号下已开始退出一部，但许多县份尚未做好。二、部分地区尚有隐藏的封建尾巴，或由干部包庇，或因群众发动不够而未能彻底割除。三、部分地区尚有些落后村，还有“死角”，需要继续消除。四、有些地区中农之间不够团结，中农未解除怕斗的顾虑，影响生产。
