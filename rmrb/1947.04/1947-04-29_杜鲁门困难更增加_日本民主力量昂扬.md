　　Truman's Difficulties Increase Further
    Japanese Democratic Forces Soar
    American reactionaries say: "Truman's prestige has been increasing day by day since Wallace was made to resign as Secretary of Commerce." The truth is quite the opposite. Since Wallace's resignation, Truman's reputation has been declining day by day. Now, in the eyes of the American people, Truman is a reactionary, a traitor to President Roosevelt. Last year's election, in which the Democratic Party was badly defeated, is proof of this. Now, Truman's difficulties are increasing even more: In foreign affairs, the discussion of the aid to Greece and Turkey bill shows that the forces of the opposition within the American bourgeoisie are growing; the reactionaries tried their best, and finally had Marshall come out to support it, hoping to get the Senate to pass it unanimously to show unity within the United States; but the result was that more than a quarter of the senators opposed the bill, reaching as many as 23 votes. According to word-of-mouth news from the United States: Some of the senators who voted in favor voted in favor because they were afraid of being called communists. The result of this vote not only did not show the unity of the American bourgeoisie's foreign policy, but showed that it was even more inconsistent than before. Judging from Wallace's tour of Europe and the US Senate's discussion of the aid to Greece and Turkey bill, the situation in the United States is very similar to the situation before Roosevelt came to power in 1932. At that time, the reactionaries were in power, and the Roosevelt faction did not have much say, but was increasingly gaining the masses; the result developed into Roosevelt's rise to power and the reactionaries' downfall. Truman's other major difficulty is the domestic economic difficulty. Truman delivered a long speech at the Associated Press anniversary meeting, calling on workers, farmers, and capitalists across the country to unite and maintain the prosperity of the American economy. The speech itself shows that the US economic difficulties are already very serious. Truman wants to cover up this seriousness, but the price and labor issues are mocking him in reality.
    The Moscow Council of Ministers concluded its final meeting on the 24th, and the results will be revealed soon. Of interest to us in this week's developments is that the differences between the Soviet Union and the United States on the German peace treaty have been clarified. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov presented his views on the US draft on the 16th. The Soviet Foreign Minister criticized the US draft for: (1) not mentioning the elimination of the Nazis; (2) not recognizing the four-power control of the Ruhr heavy industrial zone; (3) not using strong clauses to stipulate the abolition of companies, trusts, cartels, banks and other monopoly enterprises, and nationalizing them; (4) not emphasizing the necessity of establishing a democratic order in Germany; (5) not having land reform; (6) setting an improper deadline for the cessation of occupation. On the positive side, Molotov put forward the Soviet draft and proposed that the treaty should be named "Treaty on the Elimination of German Militarism and the Prevention of German Aggression" and its validity should be 40 years, not 25 years. From this document, it can be seen that the US policy towards Germany is to talk empty words and do nothing practical. In fact, it is allowing German militarism to have the opportunity to revive and threaten human security again. The publication of the Molotov document exposed the differences and let the world know where the right and wrong lies. Marshall said in a threatening tone: If the Soviet Union does not agree with the US proposal, it should be held responsible for the failure of the peace treaty. With such a US draft, forcing others to agree, who can agree? If the US peace treaty is agreed to, wouldn't the blood shed by the Allied soldiers in World War II have been shed in vain?!
    The development of democratic forces can be seen from the recent elections in Japan. In the elections of county, city, district, and village chiefs held on April 5, the outspoken reactionaries only received 3 million votes (accounting for 11 percent), while the Socialist and Communist parties in the democratic front received 6.6 million votes (accounting for 25 percent). For the first time in Japanese history, 275 socialists were elected as chairmen of municipal councils. The victory of the Socialist Party is largely due to the support of the Communist Party. In many local elections, regardless of the reactionary policies of the right-wing socialists, the Socialist and Communist parties formed a united front and showed strength. According to the so-called "new constitution," the Japanese Diet has a bicameral system, and the members of the House of Councilors and the House of Representatives are scheduled to be elected on the 20th and 25th respectively. Under the rule of the US occupation forces, under the rule of the fascist police system, under the so-called "medium-sized electoral district and the electoral district system restricts this method which is absolutely beneficial to the reactionary parties) regulations, under the condition that the democratic parties' freedom of election is greatly restricted (for example, Kawakami Nobuo, the candidate of the Japanese Communist Party in Okayama Castle, Honshu, was beaten by the reactionaries during the election), and under the situation that a large number of Japanese women voters are still in feudal shackles (the number of female voters exceeds that of men by 2.5 million, but according to the preliminary statistics of the House of Councilors election, 40 percent abstained, and women accounted for the majority), the Japanese people's will cannot be fully expressed. However, even in this situation, the strength of the Japanese people is growing after all; none of the two Japanese reactionary parties supported by US imperialism have not lost their prestige in front of the people.

### 杜鲁门困难更增加  日本民主力量昂扬

　　杜鲁门困难更增加
    日本民主力量昂扬
    美国反动派说：“杜鲁门自从使华莱士辞去商务部长后，威望一天天增高了。”事实恰恰相反，从华莱士辞职后，杜鲁门的声望是一天天降低了。现在在美国人民心目中，杜鲁门就是反动派，就是罗斯福总统的叛徒。去年的选举，民主党大败，就是一个证据。现在，杜鲁门的困难更为增加：外交上在援助希土案的讨论中，显示出美国资产阶级中反对派的力量正在生长；反动派使尽全力，最后还由马歇尔出来捧场，希望能使参议院全体一致通过，以表示美国国内的一致；但是结果在参议员中反对此案的有四分之一以上，达二十三票之多。据美国口头的消息：在投赞成票的参议员中，有一部分人是怕被称为共产党而表示赞成的。此次投票的结果，不但没有表示美国资产阶级对外政策的一致，反而表示它比以前更不一致。从华莱士的游欧及美国参议院对援助希土案的讨论看来，美国的情形很像一九三二年罗斯福上台以前的情形。那时也是反动派当权，罗斯福派没有很多的发言权，却正在日益取得群众；结果发展为罗斯福的登台，与反动派的倒台。杜鲁门的另一大困难，是国内的经济困难，杜鲁门在美联社周年纪念会上，发表了长篇演说，要全国工人、农民、资本家一致团结，保持美国经济的繁荣。就是这篇讲演的本身，显示美国的经济困难已经很严重。杜鲁门要想遮盖这个严重性，但是物价问题与劳工问题却在对他作现实的嘲笑。
    莫斯科处长会议已于二十四日开完了最后一次会议，其结果不久即可揭晓。本周的发展中，对于我们有兴趣的是苏美两国对德和约的分歧已经弄清楚了。苏外长莫洛托夫于十六日提出了对于美方草案的意见，苏外长批评美方草案：（一）没有提到清除纳粹问题；（二）不承认四强管制鲁尔重工业区；（三）没有用强烈的条款规定撤销公司、托辣斯、卡德尔、银行等独占企业，使之收为国有；（四）对于德国建立民主秩序的必要没有强调；（五）没有土地改革；（六）停止占领的期限定得不妥当。在积极方面莫洛托夫提出了苏联的草案，并提议条约应名为“清除德国军国主义与防止德国侵略的条约”，其有效期限应为四十年，而非二十五年。从这个文件中可以看出美国的对德方针是说些空话，不做实事，实际上是让德国的军国主义有机会复活起来，再来威胁人类的安全。莫洛托夫文件的发表，把分歧暴露了出来，并令世人知道曲直何在。马歇尔曾以恫吓的口气说：如果苏联不同意美国提案，就应对于和约的失败负责任。以这样的美国草案，强迫别人同意，谁能同意呢？同意了美国的和约草案，第二次世界大战同盟国战士所流的血，岂不等于白流了吗？！
    自日本最近的选举中，看出了民主力量的发展。在四月五日举行的县、市、区、村长的选举中，彰明较著的反动派只得到三百万票（占百分之十一），而民主阵线中的社共两党，却得到六百六十万票（占百分之二十五）。在日本历史上，二百七十五名社会党人第一次被选为市政会的主席。社会党的胜利，在很大程度上是由于共产党的支持。在很多地方的选举中，不顾右翼社会党人的反动政策，社共两党产生了联合阵线，并表现了力量。按照所谓“新宪法”，日本国会行两院制，参众两院的议员定于二十日与二十五日分别选出。在美国占领军的统治下，在法西斯警察制度的统治下，在所谓“中型选举区及选举区制约着这种办法对于反动党派绝对有利）的规定下，在民主党派竞选自由受极大限制的条件下（例如日共本州岗山城的候选人川上送信在竞选时即遭反动派殴打），在广大日本选举妇女仍处于封建束缚中的情况之下（妇女选民数出较男子多二百五十万，但据参院选举中的初步统计，弃权者百分之四十，妇女占其中的大部分），日本的民意是无法充分表现出来的。然而，即将在这种情况下，日本人民的力量终究在成长起来；美国帝国主义所扶持的两个日本反动党派，在人民面前没有一个不是威信扫地。（新华社陕北二十六日电）
