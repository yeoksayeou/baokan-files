　　Licheng Dongguan Mule and Horse Fair
    The Masses Bought Four Hundred Head of Livestock
    [This newspaper, Licheng News] The Mule and Horse Fair in Dongguan, Licheng, held on the tenth day of the second lunar month, focused on current affairs education, establishing the idea of getting rich through prosperity of both people and wealth, and regulated agricultural tools through this conference. The conference lasted three days, with over 20,000 participants and 432 vendors. The masses bought a total of 412 head of livestock, 273 spinning wheels, and over 7,300 pieces of agricultural tools such as plows, rakes, harrows, baskets, shovels, and hoes. 36,750 zhang of Licheng homespun cloth were sold. The conference set up production and hygiene pavilions. The walls of the street were painted with ugly portraits of the four major families, large cartoons of American troops' atrocities in China and our army capturing Li Xianzhou alive in the Lunan campaign, and more than 20 prominent current affairs slogans were painted on the walls, along with Chiang Kai-shek's shameless traitorous treaties. Elementary school teachers, in conjunction with doctors, carried out propaganda. Nine units including various high and junior elementary school theater troupes and ballad teams carried out propaganda through small flower operas, plaza plays, and Yangge dances. The 450 leaflets were immediately snatched up. The masses crowded into the hygiene pavilion, and when they saw the huge pictures of the five major pests—flies, mosquitoes, lice, fleas, bedbugs—and dozens of infectious disease diagrams such as malaria and dysentery, they all stared intently and asked questions: how to deliver babies for children, and how to prevent the spread of disease. The most prominent items in the production pavilion were two-wheeled spinning machines, Liu Zhongjing's small-scale textile cooperative, Jin Yuliang's cotton planting experience, and Yang Zhonghe's indigo planting technology. An old man in his fifties grabbed the cotton planting picture and said, "No wonder I didn't catch the seedlings last year. It turns out I planted them a little too deep last year. Later, I didn't prune the few that came out, so the cotton bolls didn't open well in the autumn. This year, I have to follow Jin Yuliang's cotton planting method!" When the women saw the large spinning machine, they personally spun a bit. An old woman said, "This machine can spin more than a pound of cotton a day. I'll ask a carpenter to make one for me when I get back." When the masses walked in front of the portraits of the five major traitors, they said, "Chiang Kai-shek is the biggest of these five traitors!" After hearing about the traitorous treaties signed by Chiang Kai-shek and the United States, an old man named Liu from Zhaodian Village said excitedly, "I must go back and tell all the farmers about it, so that everyone understands and participates in the war to eliminate Chiang Kai-shek."

　　黎城东关骡马大会
    群众买了四百牲口
    【本报黎城讯】黎城东关旧历二月初十的骡马大会，以时事教育为重心，树立人财两旺发家致富的思想，通过这次大会，调剂了农具。全会历时三天，参加赶会者达两万余人，各种摊贩共四百卅二处，群众共买牲口四百一十二头，买纺花车二百七十三辆，买犁、耢、耙、箩头、锹、＠等农具七千三百余件，黎城土布三万六千七百五十丈。大会设有生产、卫生二馆，街壁上画了四大家族的丑像，美军在华暴行和鲁南战役我军活捉李仙洲的大漫画，墙上刷写着二十余条显著的时事大标语，还写着蒋贼无耻的卖国契约。小学教员结合医生共同进行宣传，各高初小剧团、鼓词队共九个单位以小花戏、广场剧、扭秧歌进行宣传，四百五十张传单，顿时抢完了。群众挤拥到卫生馆，猛看见画着斗大的五大害虫、蝇、蚊、虱、蚤、臭虫——和疟痢等几十种传染病图，一个个都注视着追问到底：养小孩怎样接生，怎样才能防止病的传染。生产馆内最显著的有两轮大纺车，刘仲景的纺织小型合作，靳玉良的植棉经验，杨仲和的种靛技术，一个五十多岁的老汉，看到种棉图时抢着说：“怨不得咱去年没捉住苗儿，原来咱去年种的有点太深了，后来出来几根也没有去打杈，秋天花圪桃就没有开好，今年咱可得照那靳玉良的种花办法去执行哩！”妇女们看到大纺车，就亲自抽纺一纺，一个老太婆说：“这车一天就纺一斤多花，俺回去也叫木匠给做一个。”群众在走到五大汉奸像跟前时，说：“这五大汉奸要算蒋介石最大啦！”赵店村一个姓刘的老汉听了蒋美签定的卖国契约后，很激奋的说：“我回去非好好给农民都说说，让大家都了解，大家去参战消灭蒋介石不行。”
