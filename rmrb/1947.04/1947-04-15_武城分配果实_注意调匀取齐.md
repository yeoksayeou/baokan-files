　　Wucheng Distributes Fruits
    Pay Attention to Even Distribution and Fairness
    [Report from our Jinnan Office on the 13th] Wucheng has conducted a thorough review of the emancipation, implementing "even distribution and fairness" for the third time. In Yujie Temple, after three rounds of struggle, 470 mu of land were distributed in the first instance. After an in-depth review, it was discovered that some military families and village cadres had received too much good land, and those who had close relationships with the village cadres also benefited, while the elderly, weak, orphans, and widows were not taken care of. The distribution was the same regardless of family size, which disadvantaged larger families. During group discussions, everyone unanimously demanded that in the second land distribution, "even distribution and fairness" should be implemented. Those who received too much land last time should receive less or none; those who received little or none should receive more. Those who were allocated riverbank land (the best land near the canal) last time should not receive any this time. This distribution ensured true fairness.

　　武城分配果实
    注意调匀取齐
    【本报冀南十三日电】武城深入翻身检查，三次实行调匀取齐。玉皆庙经过三次斗争，第一次分配了四百七十亩地，经过深入检查后，发现一部分军属和村干得的好地过多，和村干有感情的人也沾了些便宜，没照顾到老弱孤寡，人多人少的一样分，人多的吃了亏。在小组讨论中，大家一致要求，在第二次分土地中，应当“调匀取齐”，上次分多的要少分或不分；没分或少分的，要多分。上次分河圈地（靠运河地最好）者这次不分，这样分配以后，作到真正合理。
