    Respect Excellent Traditions
    New-style farm tools are good; their greatest advantage is that they save labor, and cultivation is also easily in line with the basic requirements for the healthy growth of crops (such as deep plowing, even sowing, etc.).
    Many of the original farming methods in various parts of our country are also good; their greatest advantage is that they are relatively meticulous and suitable for the specific conditions of various crops and regions.
    We cannot only maintain the good original farming methods in various parts of our country and refuse to use new-style farm tools.
    Nor can we think that increased production can be achieved simply by promoting new-style farm tools, while ignoring the many good original farming methods in various parts of our country.
    The use of certain new-style farm tools may require certain corresponding reforms in farming methods; however, if these reforms violate the original excellent farming methods, they must be extremely cautious. If the original farming methods are indeed very good, and the new-style farm tools cannot adapt to the requirements of this farming method, then we should try to improve these farm tools. If the adoption of new-style farm tools and the adoption of the original good farming methods are not contradictory, then we should strive to achieve both.
    In Heilongjiang Province, new-style farm tools have been promoted on large areas of land, while maintaining the good parts of the local original farming methods. As a result, production has been greatly increased. This is good news. The "joy" lies not only in this year's increase in production, but also in making people more clearly aware of such a method of promoting agricultural technology reform.
    Even if tractors and agricultural machinery are widely used in agricultural production in the future, this approach—the approach of combining new-style farm tools with the excellent original farming methods in various parts of our country—should still be adhered to.

### 尊重优良的传统

    尊重优良的传统
    新式农具是好的；最大的好处是省力，耕作也容易合乎农作物健壮生长的基本要求（如深耕、播种均匀等）。
    我国各地原有的许多耕作方法也是好的；最大的好处是比较细致，适合各种作物、各个地区的具体情况。
    不能只要保持我国各地原有的好的耕作方法，而拒绝使用新式农具。
    也不能认为只要推广了新式农具就可以增产，忽视了我国各地原有的许多好的耕作方法。
    使用某些新式农具，可能要求耕作方法也有相应的某些改革；可是，如果这改革是违背原有的优良的耕作方法的，便须极其慎重。如果原有的耕作方法的确是很好的，而新式农具不能适应这种耕作方式的要求，那就应该设法改进这种农具。如果采用新式农具和采用原有的好的耕作方法并不矛盾，那就该力求两全其美。
    黑龙江省在大面积土地上推广了新式农具，同时保持了当地原有的耕作方法中的好的部分。结果，大大增产了。这是一个喜讯。“喜”不仅在于今年的增产，还在于使人更加明确地认识了这样一个推行农业技术改革的方法。
    即使将来在农业生产中普遍地使用了拖拉机和农业机器，这样的做法——把新式农具和我国各地原有的优良耕作方法结合起来的做法，同样是应该坚持的。
