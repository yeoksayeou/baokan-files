Xinhua News Agency Report:

    Teachers at Renmin University of China have begun to explain the different viewpoints of various schools of thought in different sciences in their lectures, in order to cultivate students' ability to think independently.
    In the Ancient History Teaching Group of the Chinese History Teaching and Research Section, three teachers, Sun Jiaxiang, Zheng Changgan, and Tan Huizhong, are teaching Chinese Ancient History to first-year students in the History Department and the Archives Department this year. On the issue of the periodization of ancient history, they basically agree with the views of Shang Yue, the director of the Teaching and Research Section. However, in their lectures, they all pay attention to introducing the viewpoints of various schools of thought, such as Guo Moruo and Fan Wenlan, systematically and concisely introducing and analyzing the basis of these viewpoints, as well as the main differences between them. The teachers also provide relevant materials from various major schools of thought as reference for students' self-study.
    At two ancient history classroom discussion sessions, students who agreed with the views of Guo Moruo, Fan Wenlan, Shang Yue, or held their own opinions engaged in heated debates. In order to refute the viewpoints of a certain school of thought that they considered incorrect, students often had to consult many reference books and related articles. The knowledge that students now acquire is accepted on the basis of criticism, so it can be consolidated.
    Teachers in other departments also pay attention to implementing the principle of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" in their lectures. When lecturer Liu Jiongzhong of the Philosophy Teaching and Research Section lectured on the law of productivity and production relations to the philosophy branch of the Marxism-Leninism Research Class, he introduced various different views on many issues that are still being debated in academic circles. When teacher Cang Nan lectured on the definition and relationship between the base and superstructure to undergraduate students in the Economics Department, he also put forward his own different views on the past definitions.

    中国人民大学教师
    开始讲解各门科学的各学派不同观点
    据新华社讯　中国人民大学的教师们已经开始在讲台上讲解各门科学的各个学派的不同论点，以培养大学生独立思考的能力。
    中国历史教研室古代史教学小组的孙家骧、郑昌淦和谭惠中等三位教师今年分别为历史系、档案系一年级的学生讲授中国古代史。在古代史分期问题上，他们基本上都是同意教研室主任尚钺的观点的。但他们在讲课时，都注意介绍了郭沫若、范文澜等各个学派的论点，系统扼要地介绍分析了这些论点的依据，以及相互间主要分歧点。教师们还提出各个主要学派的有关资料作为学生自学时的参考。
    在两次古代史课堂讨论会上，分别同意郭沫若、范文澜、尚钺等人的观点或抱有自我见解的学生们展开了热烈的争辩。学生们为了要驳倒自己认为不对的某个学派的论点，往往要翻阅很多参考书和有关的文章。学生们现在获得的知识是在批判的基础上接受的，所以就能够巩固。
    其他各个系教师们同样也注意在讲课中贯彻百家争鸣。哲学教研室讲师刘炯忠为马列主义研究班哲学分班讲生产力与生产关系的规律性一讲时，介绍了当前学术界还在争论的很多问题的各种不同见解。教师沧南为经济系本科学生讲基础与上层建筑的定义和关系的时候，还提出了自己对过去已有的定义的不同看法。
