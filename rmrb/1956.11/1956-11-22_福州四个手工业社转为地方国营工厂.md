Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 20th – The Fuzhou City agricultural tool casting, machinery repair, ironware, and toothbrush production cooperatives were converted into local state-owned factories in September and October.

These handicraft production cooperatives mostly had a foundation of two to three years of operation. After obtaining the consent of the members, the Fuzhou City leadership merged and reorganized them into local state-owned factories. After the conversion, the state immediately invested over 100,000 yuan, added some equipment, and assigned a certain number of leading cadres who understood the business. It is estimated that the output value of these four factories in the fourth quarter will increase by more than 30% compared to the third quarter.

After these handicraft production cooperatives were converted into factories, the issues of the original cooperative's public accumulation funds, labor dividends, shares, and tools were all reasonably resolved through democratic discussions among the members. Specifically, all the original labor dividends of each cooperative were returned to the members before the end of the year; the shares paid by the members upon joining the cooperative were also gradually returned to the members according to the production and development of each factory; 20% of the cooperative's public accumulation was allocated as a collective welfare fund for the employees after the conversion, 30% was used as capital for the new enterprise, and the remaining 50% was temporarily lent to the enterprise, with the enterprise paying interest to the higher-level handicraft cooperative association on a regular basis. The tool depreciation payments were also handled temporarily by the method of paying interest on deposit in the factory. The reasonable resolution of these issues further improved the production enthusiasm of the masses, and production efficiency in October increased by 40% compared to September.

    福州四个手工业社转为地方国营工厂
    据新华社福州20日电　福州市农具铸造、机械修配、铁器、牙刷等四个手工业生产合作社，在9、10月间分别转为地方国营工厂。
    这些手工业生产合作社大都已有二、三年以上的办社基础。福州市领导机关，在取得社员的同意后，分别把他们合并、改建为地方国营工厂。转厂后，国家立即投入了十多万元资金，增添了部分设备，并配备了一定数量懂得业务的领导干部。预计这四个厂第四季度产值将比第三季度增加30％以上。
    这些手工业生产合作社在转为工厂以后，对原来社内的公积金、劳动分红、股金、以及工具等问题都经过社员民主讨论，作了合理的解决。这就是把各社原来的劳动分红，一律在年底前发还给社员；社员入社时交纳的股金也根据各个厂生产发展的情况，逐步归还社员；合作社的公共积累提出20％作为转厂后职工集体福利基金，30％作为新企业的资金，余下来的50％暂借给企业，由企业定期向手工业上级联社付息。工具折价款也暂按存厂付息的办法处理。这些问题的合理解决进一步提高了群众的生产积极性，10月份生产效率比9月份提高了40％。
