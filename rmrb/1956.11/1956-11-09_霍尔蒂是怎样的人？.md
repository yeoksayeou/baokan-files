    What kind of person was Horthy?
    Recently, some readers have written to inquire about what Horthy elements are. Here is a brief answer:
    Horthy was a bloody fascist dictator in Hungarian history. He ruled Hungary for twenty-five years, from 1919 to 1944. The Hungarian working people spent long and painful years under his horrifyingly brutal rule. It was not until 1945, when the Soviet army defeated the Hitler fascist army, that the Hungarian people were liberated from fascist rule.
    Horthy was originally an admiral in the Austro-Hungarian Emperor's navy and an extremely reactionary fellow. After the establishment of the Hungarian Soviet regime in 1919, Horthy immediately engaged in activities against the revolutionary regime, forming a counter-revolutionary "National Army" within Yugoslavia to subvert the Soviet regime and establish a military dictatorship. After the failure of the Hungarian Soviet regime, Horthy immediately led the "National Army" into Hungary, relying on the power of the Allied Powers, and became the ruler of Hungary. From then on, the whole of Hungary fell into white terror. At that time, tens of thousands of workers were killed, 70,000 workers were arrested and imprisoned, and the Communist leader Szamuely was also killed. The Communist Party was forced to go underground. Under these conditions of white terror, Hungary held parliamentary elections in the spring of 1920, and the monarchy headed by a regent was restored. Horthy was elected regent. Thus, a fascist dictatorship representing the interests of large landlords and capitalists was established in Hungary.
    After Horthy came to power, he abolished the basic democratic rights of the people, implemented a nationwide fascist policy, abolished the electoral system, and declared all revolutionary organizations illegal. In economic terms, he led Hungary to the brink of bankruptcy, and the people's lives were extremely difficult.
    After Hitler seized power in Germany, the fascist rule in Hungary became increasingly intensified. Not only was the persecution of the Communist Party intensified, but the parliament was also abolished, and the trade unions were "nationalized," extinguishing even the last remaining bit of democratic freedom. Subsequently, the Horthy fascist regime promulgated some new reactionary decrees. Regent Horthy was granted powers almost equal to those of a king. In addition, the government supported various reactionary fascist organizations, such as the "Shooters" and the "Crusaders." These fascist organizations combined terrorist activities with nationalist agitation and propaganda to persecute the working people. After the outbreak of World War II, Hungary was finally pushed by the Horthy rulers onto the path of becoming a vassal state of Hitler, making Hungary an agricultural appendage of Germany and a base for attacking the Soviet Union, plunging the country into disaster during World War II. During the heinous war against the Soviet Union, the Hungarian armed forces and the national economy were completely subordinated to Hitler's control.
    When the Hitler bandit gang was severely attacked by the Soviet army, the Hungarian ruling group headed by Horthy attempted to make a separate peace with Britain and the United States to prevent the collapse of their reactionary rule. However, Hitler's Germany, which sought to keep Hungary as its servant, sent troops to occupy Hungary, adding the oppression of foreign occupiers to the Hungarian working people. In October 1944, Horthy announced that Hungary would withdraw from the war, and on that day, Horthy was replaced by the Hitler bandit gang. Horthy's twenty-five years of bloody and terrifying rule over the Hungarian people came to an end. However, the disasters he brought to the Hungarian people were immeasurable.
    Szalasi, the leader of the Hungarian Hitler fascist party, the Nyilas Arrow Cross Party, succeeded Horthy. He announced that he would mobilize "volunteer troops" to continue helping the Hitler bandit gang fight, and at the same time began to transport Hungary's valuable materials to Germany. However, this vicious reactionary government of Hungary soon collapsed due to the Soviet army's encirclement of Budapest. The heroic Soviet army liberated Hungary, and from then on, a broad road of democratic development was opened up before the Hungarian people.

### 霍尔蒂是怎样的人？

    霍尔蒂是怎样的人？
    最近有的读者来信询问什么是霍尔蒂分子，现简答如下：
    霍尔蒂是匈牙利历史上的一个血腥的法西斯独裁者。他从1919年到1944年统治匈牙利有二十五年之久。匈牙利劳动人民在他的骇人听闻的残暴统治下，渡过了漫长的痛苦岁月。直到1945年苏军击败了希特勒法西斯军队后，匈牙利人民才从法西斯统治下解放出来。
    霍尔蒂原是奥匈帝国皇帝的海军大将，是个极其反动的家伙。1919年匈牙利苏维埃政权成立后，霍尔蒂即紧张进行反对革命政权的活动，在南斯拉夫境内组成了反革命的“国民军”，从事颠复苏维埃政权和建立军事独裁制度的活动。匈牙利的苏维埃政权失败以后，霍尔蒂立即率领“国民军”闯进匈牙利，依靠协约国的力量，成为匈牙利的统治者。从此匈牙利全国就陷入白色恐怖之中。当时数万工人遭到杀害，七万工人被捕入狱，共产党的领袖萨麦里也被杀害，共产党被迫转入地下。就在这种白色恐怖的条件下，1920年春，匈牙利举行了国会的选举，以摄政为首的君主制复辟了，霍尔蒂当选为摄政。于是代表大地主和大资本家的利益的法西斯独裁制度便在匈牙利确立了。
    霍尔蒂上台后，取消了人民群众的基本民主权利，实行了全国法西斯化政策，废止了选举制，并宣布一切革命组织为非法。在经济上，把匈牙利引到破产的边缘，人民的生活困苦万状。
    希特勒在德国夺取政权后，匈牙利的法西斯统治就一天天变本加厉，不仅对共产党的迫害更加紧了，而且取消了国会，实行了职工会的“国家化”，连最后残存的一点点民主自由都扑灭了。随后，霍尔蒂法西斯政权又颁布了一些新的反动法令。摄政霍尔蒂被授与了几乎与国王相等的权力。此外，政府还支持各种反动的法西斯组织，如“射击手”，“十字军”等。这些法西斯组织把恐怖活动和民族主义的煽动宣传结合起来，迫害劳动人民。第二次世界大战爆发后，匈牙利终被霍尔蒂统治者推上了希特勒附庸国的道路，使匈牙利成为德国的农业附庸和进攻苏联的基地，使国家在第二次世界大战期间陷入了灾难的境地。在进行反苏的罪恶战争期间，匈牙利武装力量和国家经济都完全服从希特勒的支配。
    当希特勒匪帮受到苏军的严重打击后，以霍尔蒂为首的匈牙利统治集团企图与英美单独媾和，以防止自己反动统治的溃灭。但是，力图把匈牙利保留为自己仆从的希特勒德国，出兵占领了匈牙利，匈牙利劳动人民身上又加上了外国占领者的压迫。1944年10月，霍尔蒂宣布匈牙利要退出战争，就在这一天，霍尔蒂就被希特勒匪帮撤换。霍尔蒂对匈牙利人民的二十五年的血腥恐怖统治宣告结束。但是，他给匈牙利人民带来的灾难是无法计量的。
    继霍尔蒂执政的是匈牙利的希特勒法西斯党尼拉什分子（即箭十字党）的头子萨拉希，他宣布要动员“志愿军”继续帮助希特勒匪帮作战，同时开始把匈牙利的贵重物资运往德国。但是，匈牙利的这个凶恶的反动政府，不久就因苏军包围布达佩斯而垮台了。英勇的苏军解放了匈牙利，从此匈牙利人民面前便展开了民主发展的康庄大道。
