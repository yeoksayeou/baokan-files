Xinhua News Agency, 12th – Beijing's design, construction, and materials departments are cooperating with each other, saving a significant amount of steel and cement. Since the relevant units started communicating with each other at the end of August, they have resolved issues in ten major steel and cement saving measures, including brick arch floors, electric welding of steel bars, and dry-hard concrete.
    In the past, designers worried about the inadequate equipment at construction sites, so they were hesitant to use cold-drawn steel bars in their designs. Construction workers, lacking information about the specifications and performance of steel in the design drawings, were reluctant to cold-draw. The steel supply departments, lacking testing equipment, couldn't guarantee the quality of steel after cold-drawing. This prevented the widespread implementation of cold-drawn steel bars, a measure that could save a large amount of steel. Recently, the Beijing Municipal Materials Supply Bureau, Beijing Municipal Construction Engineering Bureau, and Beijing Municipal Design Institute jointly held a symposium. The Design Institute helped conduct physical performance tests on the steel, and all construction sites added cold-drawing equipment. Now, this measure has been widely implemented. According to statistics from the Municipal Design Institute, changing ordinary steel bars to cold-drawn steel bars can save 250 tons of steel each month.
    In the past, designers worried that construction workers' technical skills were insufficient, so they were hesitant to promote dry-hard concrete. In early September, designers strengthened contact with the construction departments and learned that many construction sites were already producing dry-hard concrete. They immediately changed ordinary concrete to dry-hard concrete in the design drawings, and increased the cement grade from 110 to 170, saving 2,000 tons of cement each month.
    Recently, the Beijing Municipal Design Institute also invited staff from the construction and materials departments to visit the site and observe their successful experiments using loess and fly ash to replace cement. These days, all construction sites in Beijing have started adding loess or fly ash to mortar to replace cement.
    Xinhua News Agency, 13th – The Beijing Municipal People's Committee has formulated seventy-five measures to save building materials such as steel, cement, and wood, to ensure the better completion of the capital's construction tasks.
    Regarding steel conservation, the measures stipulate the use of cold-processed steel bars and high-strength steel bars to replace ordinary steel bars. Bamboo reinforcement should be used to replace steel reinforcement in small concrete components such as pipe trench covers without concentrated loads. Iron railings, iron fences, iron lamp posts, and iron windows should not be used in general civil buildings. In plumbing, sanitation, and water and electricity ventilation projects, substitute steel materials with glass tubes, porcelain tubes, bamboo tubes, and earthenware pipes.
    The measures stipulate that design and construction departments should use plasticizers and admixtures as substitutes for cement. Dry-hard concrete should be promoted in prefabricated concrete components. To save construction timber, temporary dormitories, offices, warehouses, and canteens should generally use bamboo structures. General civil buildings can use bamboo structure roof trusses. Design departments should use standard doors and windows as much as possible. Production units should use sawdust, particleboard, and hard miscellaneous materials to replace wood in the production of furniture, doors, windows, and floors.
    The Beijing Municipal People's Committee requires all units to ensure project quality when implementing various measures, and timely reward individuals or units that actively promote material-saving measures.

    解决十项节约钢材水泥的问题
    七十五项节约建筑材料的措施将普遍推行
    新华社12日讯　北京市的设计、施工和材料部门相互配合协作，节省了大量钢材和水泥。有关单位自从8月底开始互相通气以后，已经解决了砖拱楼板、电焊钢筋、干硬性混凝土等十项重大的节约钢材、水泥措施中的问题。
    过去设计师们担心建筑工地设备不完善，一直不敢在设计图上使用冷拉钢筋，建筑工人们因为在设计图上看不到钢材的规格和性能，不敢冷拉；供应钢材的部门，由于没有试验设备，对供应的钢材不敢保证冷拉以后的质量，使冷拉钢筋这项能够节约大量钢材的措施，一直不能普遍推行。最近，北京市物资供应局、北京市建筑工程局和北京市设计院联合开了一个座谈会，由设计院帮助做钢材的物理性能试验，各工地都添置了冷拉设备。现在，这项措施已经普遍推行了。据市设计院统计，把普通钢筋改为冷拉钢筋，每个月能节省二百五十吨钢材。
    过去设计师们担心建筑工人技术条件不够，一直不敢推广干硬性混凝土。9月初，设计师们和建筑部门加强了联系，才知道许多工地已经在制作干硬性混凝土，他们立刻在设计图上把普通混凝土都改为干硬性混凝土，把水泥的标号从一百一十号提高到一百七十号，每月节省的水泥能达两千吨。
    最近北京市设计院还邀请施工和材料部门的工作人员，到现场去参观他们试验成功的利用黄土、烟灰代替水泥的方法。这几天，北京市各建筑工地，都开始在砂浆中掺用黄土或烟灰来代替水泥。
    新华社13日讯　北京市人民委员会制定了七十五项节约钢铁、水泥、木材等建筑材料的措施，保证更好地完成首都建设任务。
    在节约钢铁方面，措施规定要采用冷加工处理的钢筋和高强度钢筋代替普通钢筋。要在无集中荷重的管沟盖板等小型凝混土构件上使用竹筋代替钢筋。一般民用建筑不得用铁栏杆、铁围墙、铁灯柱和铁窗。在水暖卫生和水电通风工程中，采用玻璃管、瓷管、竹管、缸瓦管等代用品代替钢材。
    措施规定，设计、施工部门都要利用塑化剂和掺合料等代用品代替水泥。在混凝土预制构件中，要推广干硬性混凝土。为了节约建筑木材，临时性的宿舍、办公室、仓库和食堂，要普遍采用竹材建筑。一般民用建筑可以采用竹结构的屋架。设计部门应该尽量采用标准门窗。生产单位要采用锯末、刨花板、硬杂碎料来代替木材制作家具、门窗和地板。
    北京市人民委员会要求各单位在推行各项措施的时候，必须保证工程质量，对积极推行节约材料措施的个人或单位，应该及时给以奖励。
