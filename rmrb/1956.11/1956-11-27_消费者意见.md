　　Not a Gas Lamp, but a "Gets You Mad" Lamp

　　The Yipinglang Coal Mine Amateur School in Yunnan recently bought two "Giant Wheel" brand gas lamps produced by the Wuhan Gas Lamp Factory, a joint state-private enterprise. After buying them, they couldn't be used the first night. The wheel column for opening it broke as soon as it was twisted. Both the air intake and exhaust leaked. Other rivets and welded parts were loose. Using such a gas lamp requires a repairman to specialize in repairs and an air-pumping worker to specialize in pumping air. Therefore, comrades call this "gas lamp" a "gets you mad" lamp.

　　Only Locks Up Gentlemen, Doesn't Lock Up Thieves

　　We recently bought a batch of "Liberation" brand locks, hoping they could effectively safeguard our documents. Who knew that as soon as we used them, we discovered that all "Liberation" brand lock keys could be used interchangeably. What's the use of such locks? We hope that the Tianjin Second Hardware Cooperative, which produces these locks, will quickly improve the quality of "Liberation" brand locks.

　　Non-Durable Steel Plate

　　Our unit bought a mimeograph steel plate produced by the Shanghai Limin Arts and Crafts Factory. The appearance is quite beautiful, and it even says "Scientifically Refined, Durable." Unexpectedly, after using it a few times, the grain of the steel plate became smooth, and it was impossible to print after engraving.

    不是汽灯是“气灯”
    云南一平浪煤矿业余学校新买了两盏公私合营武汉汽灯厂出品的“巨轮牌”汽灯。买到后，头一晚上就不能用，管开的轮柱一扭就断了。进气放气都漏气。其他铆钉及焊接部分“七动八摇”的。用这样的汽灯得有一个修理工专管修理，一个打气工专管打气才行，所以同志们把这种“汽灯”叫“气灯”。

    只锁君子，不锁小人
    我们最近买了一批“解放牌”锁，希望它能很好地为我们保管文件。谁知我们一用就发现所有“解放牌”锁的钥匙都能互换使用。这样的锁有什么用呢？希望生产这种锁的天津五金第二社赶快提高“解放牌”锁的质量。　侯贵荣
    不耐用的钢板
    我们单位买了一块上海利民工艺厂出产的誊写钢板，外表倒美观，上边还写着“科学炼制，经久耐用”，不料用了几回，钢板的纹就平滑了，刻字印不上了。
