Regarding the question of whether the contradiction between materialism and idealism will still exist in a communist society, several newspapers and periodicals have published articles in recent months, launching a debate. The majority affirms that idealism will still exist in a communist society, but not in the same sense as idealism in a class society. They believe that as long as the epistemological roots that generate idealism exist, idealism will continue to exist, and although the class roots will be eliminated at that time, the social roots will still exist. However, some others believe that idealism is the general system of idealistic viewpoints, and its appearance represents the interests of a certain class. When a communist society arrives, and the class roots that produce idealism no longer exist, there will be no more idealism. The situation where people's subjective understanding does not conform to the objective reality should not be called idealism.

On October 10th, the Wuhan Changjiang Daily published an article titled "Is there Idealism in Communist Society?" introducing the discussion on this issue held by the Hubei Provincial Party Committee Propaganda Department's summer training class for theoretical instructors.

At the discussion, some comrades, based on the following reasons, determined that there would be no more idealism in a communist society. They said: The two philosophical schools of materialism and idealism reflect different class interests. In a communist society, classes have long been eliminated, so it is impossible for philosophical schools representing certain class interests to appear; not only will there be no idealistic schools, but there will be no materialistic schools either. The contradiction between the subjective and the objective that exists at that time, and the incorrect reflection of reality caused by this contradiction, should not be called idealism. Idealism as a world view is the general system of idealistic viewpoints, and some viewpoints that have not yet formed a system should not be called idealism. A conscious idealist should be distinguished from someone who unconsciously makes idealistic mistakes. In a communist society, the errors people make when the subjective does not conform to the objective do not arise from the idealistic system, nor can they constitute an idealistic system, and the nature of the person making the error and the error itself is not a conscious defense of the interests of the reactionary class, so it can only be called an idealistic viewpoint or idealistic thought, and it should not be exaggerated as idealism. Someone said: At this time, the contradiction between materialism and idealism has been transformed into the contradiction between the finiteness and infiniteness of knowledge.

Those who opposed the above view believed that the analysis of the roots that generate idealism must be linked to historical conditions, and that idealism in a communist society should not be understood as the same as idealism in a class society. They believed that in a communist society, the contradiction between materialism and idealism could continue to appear in new forms. They believed that the epistemological roots of idealism can never be eliminated, and still exist after the elimination of classes. In a communist society, the struggle between materialism and idealism is a reflection of the contradiction between the subjective and the objective, the advanced and the backward, and the productive forces and the relations of production; as long as these contradictions exist, the struggle between materialism and idealism will exist. Some people believe that whether the idealism of communist society is called "idealistic viewpoint" or "idealistic thought," whether idealism is divided into those that constitute a system and those that do not, whether it is conscious or unconscious, they are all ultimately taking consciousness as primary, and in the final analysis are all idealism. Engels' definition of materialism and idealism should not be said to refer only to philosophical schools; it should be emphasized that the relationship between thinking and existence is the basis for distinguishing between materialism and idealism. Someone also proposed the idea that the generation of idealism has only one epistemological root, because it is a common root for the generation of idealism in any society. Some people opposed this statement, saying: The roots of idealism in any society are two, namely, the epistemological root and the social root. The social root refers to class reasons in a class society, and in a communist society it refers to the contradiction between the advanced and the backward, and the productive forces and the relations of production. Therefore, it is inappropriate and unfounded to say that the generation of idealism has only an epistemological root.

The November issue of "Study" magazine published an article by Pang Pu, who also advocated using the concept of "social root" to replace "class root." He said that this concept includes both the entire content of "class root" and also accommodates some other material roots of philosophy. He said: The epistemological roots of idealism, the subjective and objective conditions for people to generate incorrect understanding and even idealism, have not decreased at all in socialist and communist societies compared to the past, only its social roots have undergone tremendous changes. In class societies, the class root plays a leading role in the social root, and other social roots, such as the contradiction between productive forces and relations of production, the contradiction between the individual and the collective, the contradiction between leaders and the masses, the contradiction between the advanced and the backward, etc., do not appear important. In socialist and communist societies, these contradictions become the main content of the social roots that generate philosophy. With the development of society, the number of people and groups who consciously stand on the conservative side of contradictions will slowly decrease, but the people and groups who unconsciously stand on the conservative side of contradictions will never be eliminated, so idealism will arise in the minds of these people and spread among them. The "pure" form of idealism at that time will be a special form in the history of the development of idealism. It will not be a school that openly advocates the primacy of thinking and the secondary of existence, but will be an ideological viewpoint that is mixed with many sentences of truth, and ultimately recognizes the primacy of thinking.

On August 12th, the Shanghai Liberation Daily published Xu Shunjiao's article "Why is there still a struggle between materialism and idealism in communist society?" The author also believes that because the epistemological roots that generate idealism still exist, idealism still exists, and the struggle between materialism and idealism will exist. He said that both dogmatism and empiricism, these two kinds of subjectivism, require the objective to obey the subjective, and therefore are both idealism. He refuted the view that "in a communist society, there are only individual errors in the process of cognition, and there is no idealism," saying that the error of this understanding lies in unilaterally understanding idealism, only acknowledging that what constitutes an erroneous system of thought is considered idealism, while denying other manifestations of idealism, and even more so, not understanding that the essence of subjectivism is idealism. On November 5th, Liberation Daily published Kang Ping's dissenting opinion, criticizing Xu Shunjiao's argument that "everything where people's subjective understanding correctly reflects objective reality is materialism; everything that distorts objective reality is idealism." He believed that on this issue, "the boundary for determining whether or not it is idealism does not lie in whether the subjective conforms to the objective, but in whether the subjective is hardened or rigid." People who can correct their erroneous thoughts in a timely manner cannot be called idealists, but should be called materialists; such errors that are corrected in a timely manner should not be called idealistic errors either. In addition, he believed that it was wrong for Xu Shunjiao to only point out the epistemological roots of idealism and ignore its social roots. (Shuang)

### 在共产主义社会中是不是还有唯物主义和唯心主义的矛盾？

    在共产主义社会中是不是还有唯物主义和唯心主义的矛盾？
    关于唯物主义和唯心主义的矛盾在共产主义社会中是不是还将存在的问题，近几个月来已有若干报刊发表了文章，展开了争论。多数人是肯定在共产主义社会中仍有唯心主义存在，只是不是在阶级社会中那种意义下的唯心主义。他们认为只要产生唯心主义的认识论根源存在，唯心主义就会继续存在，而且，那时阶级的根源虽然消灭了，但社会的根源也还存在着。但也有一些人认为唯心主义是唯心观点的总体系，它的出现是代表一定阶级利益的，到共产主义社会，产生唯心主义的阶级根源既已不存在，就不会再有唯心主义了；人们认识上的主观和客观不相符合的情况，不能被称为唯心主义。
    10月10日武汉长江日报以“共产主义社会还有没有唯心主义？”为题，介绍了中共湖北省委宣传部暑期理论教员进修班关于这个问题的讨论情况。
    在讨论会上，有些同志基于下述理由认定在共产主义社会里不会再有唯心主义。他们说：唯物主义和唯心主义这两个哲学上的派别反映着不同的阶级利益，在共产主义社会，阶级早已消灭了，因此不可能出现代表一定阶级利益的哲学派别；不仅不会有唯心主义的派别，而且不会有唯物主义的派别。那时存在的主观和客观的矛盾，以及由这种矛盾所引起的对现实的不正确的反映，可以不把它叫做唯心主义。作为世界观的唯心主义乃是唯心观点的总的体系，不能把还没有构成体系的一些观点也叫做唯心主义，自觉的唯心主义者和不自觉地犯了唯心主义错误的人也应该有所区别。在共产主义社会中人们犯的主观不符合客观的错误不是从唯心主义体系中产生的，也不可能构成唯心主义体系，而犯错误的人和错误的性质，也不是有意识地替反动阶级利益作辩护，因此，只能叫做唯心主义观点或唯心思想，不能夸大其为唯心主义。有人说：这时候，唯物主义和唯心主义的矛盾已转化为认识的有限性和无限性的矛盾了。
    反对上述看法的人认为：对产生唯心主义的根源的分析必须和历史条件联系起来，不能把共产主义社会里的唯心主义和阶级社会里的唯心主义理解成是一样的。他们认为，在共产主义社会里，唯物主义和唯心主义的矛盾可以以新的形态继续出现。他们认为唯心主义的认识论根源是永远不能消灭的，在阶级消灭以后仍然存在。在共产主义社会里唯物主义和唯心主义的斗争是主观和客观、先进和落后、生产力和生产关系矛盾的反映；只要这些矛盾存在，唯物主义和唯心主义的斗争就会存在。有人认为，不管将共产主义社会的唯心主义叫做“唯心主义观点”也好，“唯心思想”也好，将唯心主义区分为构成体系的和没有构成体系的也好，自觉的和不自觉的也好，它们实际上都是以意识为第一性的，归根结底都是唯心主义。不能把恩格斯的关于唯物主义和唯心主义的定义说成仅仅指哲学派别而言，应该强调思维对存在的关系问题才是区别唯物主义和唯心主义的根据。有人并提出了唯心主义的产生只有一个认识论的根源的说法，因为它是任何社会产生唯心主义的共有的根源。有人反对这个说法，说：唯心主义产生的根源在任何社会中都有两个，即认识论的根源和社会的根源。社会根源在阶级社会中是指阶级原因，在共产主义社会中则是指先进和落后、生产力和生产关系的矛盾。因此，说唯心主义的产生只有认识论的根源是不妥当的，没有根据的。
    学习杂志11月号刊载了庞朴的文章，他也主张用“社会根源”这个概念来代替“阶级根源”。他说在这个概念中，既包括有“阶级根源”的全部内容，也容纳了哲学的其他一些物质根源。他说：唯心主义的认识论根源，人们产生错误认识以至唯心主义的主客观条件，在社会主义和共产主义社会中，比之过去丝毫也没有减少，只是在其社会根源上，起了巨大变化。在阶级社会中，阶级根源在社会根源中起着主导作用，其他社会根源，如生产力和生产关系的矛盾、个人和集体的矛盾、领导和群众的矛盾、先进和落后的矛盾等等，不显得重要，到社会主义和共产主义社会中，这些矛盾就成了产生哲学的社会根源的主要内容。随着社会的发展，自觉地站在矛盾的保守方面的人和集团，将慢慢地减少下去，但不自觉地站在矛盾的保守方面的人和集团，却永远不会消除，因此唯心主义将在这一部分人的思想中产生出来，并在他们中间流传下去。那时唯心主义的“纯粹的”形式，将是唯心主义发展史上的一个特殊的形态，它将不是公开主张思维第一性存在第二性的学派，而将是同很多真理的字句掺和在一起的，归根结底承认思维第一性的思想观点。
    8月12日上海解放日报发表了徐顺教的“为什么到共产主义社会，还有唯物主义和唯心主义的斗争”一文。作者也认为由于唯心主义产生的认识论根源仍存在，所以唯心主义仍然存在，唯物主义和唯心主义的斗争就会存在。他说教条主义和经验主义这两种主观主义都是要求客观服从主观，因此都是唯心主义。他批驳了“在共产主义社会里只有认识过程中的个别错误，没有唯心主义”的看法，他说，这种认识的错误在于片面地理解唯心主义，只承认成为错误的思想体系的才算唯心主义，而否认唯心主义的其他表现形式，更不了解主观主义实质就是唯心主义。解放日报在11月5日发表了康平的反对意见，他批评了徐顺教的“凡是人们的主观认识正确地反映客观现实的，便是唯物主义；凡是歪曲地反映客观现实的，便是唯心主义”的论点。他认为在这个问题上“判明是否唯心主义的界限并不在于主观是否符合于客观，而在于主观是否硬化或僵化。”对错误的思想能及时改正的人不能称之为唯心主义者，应该称之为唯物主义者；对于这种及时改正的错误，也不能称之为唯心主义的错误。此外，他认为徐顺教仅仅指出唯心主义产生的认识论的根源而忽视其社会的根源是不对的。（霜）
