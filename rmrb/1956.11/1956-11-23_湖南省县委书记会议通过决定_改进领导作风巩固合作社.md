Hunan Provincial County Party Committee Meeting Passes Resolution
	Improve Leadership Style, Consolidate Cooperatives

Changsha Dispatch: The Hunan Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a meeting of county and city Party Committee secretaries from November 2nd to 14th.

Last winter and spring, Hunan Province completed the initial stage of agricultural collectivization, and by the end of September this year, it achieved advanced agricultural collectivization. According to preliminary statistics: Although this year suffered from a drought unseen in decades, 60% of the agricultural production cooperatives in the province still increased grain production compared to last year, 15% remained the same, and 25% experienced reduced production. The reason these cooperatives experienced reduced production was largely due to the irresistible drought. Only 3% of the total number of cooperatives experienced reduced production due to poor management. The meeting believed that the principles and policies adopted by the province in leading agricultural production and achieving advanced agricultural collectivization over the past year were basically correct. However, many shortcomings and errors also arose in specific work. For example, production plans were not comprehensive enough, and there was blindness in individual projects; some excessively emphasized collective management while neglecting household sideline occupations of cooperative members; some production measures, such as planting Japonica rice Aomori No. 5 and using double-wheeled double-shared plows and threshing machines, were widely promoted without sufficient experimentation; some cooperative cadres developed a commandist style of work. The meeting believed that the causes of these shortcomings and errors were subjectivism and bureaucratism.

The meeting determined that the work tasks for this winter and next spring are to actively carry out winter production, summarize this year's cooperative experience, rectify and consolidate cooperatives, and plan and prepare for next year's production.

In order to accomplish the above tasks, the meeting emphasized the necessity of going deep among the masses, going deep into reality, following the mass line, studying diligently, strengthening investigation and research, summarizing experience at any time, and overcoming the style of subjectivism and bureaucratism. In order to strengthen leadership at the grassroots level, the province decided to draw seven thousand cadres from provincial, prefectural, and county-level agencies to go deep into the townships and cooperatives to help with work.

The meeting discussed and arranged for the current annual final accounting and distribution of agricultural cooperatives, winter production, disaster relief work, support for various economic tasks, and how to strengthen the county's leadership over townships after the merging of districts and townships.

    湖南省县委书记会议通过决定
    改进领导作风巩固合作社
    本报长沙电　中共湖南省委于11月2日至14日召开全省县、市委书记会议。
    湖南省去冬今春完成初级农业合作化，到今年9月底，又实现了高级农业合作化。据初步统计：今年虽然遭受几十年来未有的旱灾，但全省60％的农业生产合作社还比去年增加了粮食产量，15％的社不增不减，25％的社减产了。这些合作社所以减产了，绝大部分是由于遭受了不可抗拒的旱灾。由于管理不善而减产的仅占总社数的3％。会议认为，一年来，全省在领导农业生产和实现高级农业合作化方面所采取的方针、政策基本上是正确的。但在具体工作上也产生了不少的缺点和错误。如在制定生产计划时不够全面，在个别项目上有盲目性；有的过分强调了集体经营而忽视了社员家庭副业；有些生产措施如种植粳稻青森五号，使用双轮双铧犁、打稻机等，没有经过试验就大量推广；有些社干部滋长了强迫命令作风。会议认为：产生这些缺点和错误的原因，是主观主义和官僚主义。
    会议确定：全省今冬明春的工作任务是积极开展冬季生产，总结今年办社经验，整顿巩固合作社，规划和准备明年生产。
    为了完成上述任务，会议强调必须深入群众，深入实际，走群众路线，努力学习，加强调查研究，随时总结经验，克服主观主义与官僚主义的作风。为了加强对基层的领导，全省决定从省、地、县各级机关抽调七千名干部，深入乡、社，帮助工作。
    会议对当前农业社的全年决算分配、冬季生产、救灾工作、各项经济工作的支持与撤区并乡后如何加强县对乡的领导等问题，都作了讨论和安排。　（黄驭白）
