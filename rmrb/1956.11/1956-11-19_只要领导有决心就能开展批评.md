    Criticism and self-criticism are as indispensable to us communists as air and water. Whether criticism and self-criticism can be carried out and carried out well depends on the leadership. That is, whether the leadership is determined to promote democracy and allow the masses to speak freely; whether it is determined to listen to and accept the opinions and criticisms of the masses, and improve leadership and work. As long as the leadership is determined, it can take effective measures to promote democracy and encourage the masses to carry out bottom-up criticism; as long as the leadership is determined, it can find ways and methods to solve problems.
    This principle has been proven once again in the recent months of democratic promotion, criticism, and self-criticism within the departments directly under the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China.
    In July of this year, the departments directly under the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China convened the Fifth Party Congress. At the meeting, Yang Shangkun, Secretary of the Party Committee of the departments directly under the Central Committee, repeatedly emphasized that "leading comrades should often consciously cultivate an atmosphere of criticism and an atmosphere of democracy. We should encourage comrades who offer opinions and not打击 [dǎ jī - to strike, hit, attack; to crack down on]." "Comrades doing leadership work should adopt a welcoming attitude towards the opinions people put forward, and should 'rejoice at criticism,' not 'be angry at criticism.'" Therefore, after the Fifth Party Congress of the departments directly under the Central Committee, the Central Committee of the Communist Young League, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, and other departments directly under the Central Committee, successively convened Party Congresses, general membership meetings, or meetings of all staff members, and other various forms of meetings, conveyed the spirit of the Fifth Party Congress of the departments directly under the Central Committee, combined with the actual situation of their own departments, promoted democracy, carried out criticism, and examined leadership work.
    The departments directly under the Central Committee originally had some systems for promoting democracy, such as carrying out criticism and self-criticism at various meetings. Precisely because of such systems, the democratic life within the departments is relatively normal, but it should be said that the democratic life in many units directly under the Central Committee is still not healthy enough, and criticism and self-criticism are not carried out very well. The main reason is that many leaders in the units do not fully recognize the benefits of promoting democracy, are not good at using these systems, and do not often take the initiative to consciously cultivate an atmosphere of criticism and self-criticism, especially bottom-up criticism, and encourage the masses to frequently and boldly put forward criticisms and suggestions to the leadership and work; they only pay attention to promoting democracy during movements, and only encourage the masses to carry out bottom-up criticism, and once the movement is over, the atmosphere of criticism becomes thin again. In this case, the masses are of course only accustomed to making criticisms to the leadership during movements, and are not accustomed to supervising the leadership in daily work, and frequently making criticisms of the leadership's work.
    In order to overcome the shortcomings of unhealthy democratic life in the past and mobilize all positive factors in the departments, this time, under the influence of the Fifth Party Congress of the departments directly under the Central Committee, the Party and administrative leaders of many units have expressed their determination to boldly let go and mobilize the masses to carry out bottom-up criticism, listen to the opinions of the masses to improve leadership and work, and adopted a welcoming and encouraging attitude towards criticism from below. For example, some directly subordinate units of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions have put forward at the beginning of the meeting: "Regardless of whether it is right or wrong, please speak up if you have any opinions." "Say whatever you have to say, there are no restrictions on speaking during the entire meeting, and the meeting will adjourn when you are finished speaking." Calling on Party members and non-Party comrades participating in the meeting to speak their minds freely. Moreover, Luo Yi, Hu Keshi and other comrades from the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League and responsible comrades from the Party Committee participated in the meetings of their affiliated units separately; many leading comrades of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions also personally listened to the opinions and criticisms raised by the masses.
    In order to be able to listen to the opinions of the masses more widely and understand more of the situation below, so as to help the leadership overcome bureaucracy, some units also absorbed non-Party comrades (including service personnel) to participate when holding general membership meetings, so that all staff members could have the opportunity to express their opinions to the Party and the leadership and make criticisms.
    The determination of the leadership greatly encouraged the courage and enthusiasm of the masses to carry out bottom-up criticism. Many comrades (including Party representatives, Party members, and non-Party comrades) raised the problems that they were unwilling to raise in the past, dared not raise, or did not result in results after raising, and boldly criticized the leadership's bureaucratic work style of not going deep into work, not understanding the situation below, only using but not cultivating cadres, and the Party's weak political and ideological leadership, lack of principles, and other shortcomings seriously. Criticisms were also made by name of specific leading comrades regarding shortcomings in leadership style and leadership methods. For example, at the Fifth Party Congress of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the content of the representatives' speeches was more profound than the previous four Party Congresses. Not only did they criticize the work of the Party Committee, but they also criticized by name certain Party member cadres who were responsible for administrative leadership. The members of the Communist Youth League in the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League and other departments also sharply criticized the closed-doorism tendency in the Party's organizational work in the past.
    The masses reacted very well after the leadership was so determined to promote democracy and carry out criticism. Many units of the masses felt that it was "the first time in history" and "such a conference is truly a conference to mobilize positive factors and eliminate negative factors." Many non-Party comrades were even more jubilant, feeling that being able to participate in such a Party Congress and being able to speak their minds at such a meeting was "a lifelong honor," expressing that they would get closer to the organization and work harder to strive to become a member of the Party's ranks in the future. Many leading comrades also believed that "this conference is a profound education for both the leadership and the masses, making the leadership clear-headed, bright-eyed, and sharp-eared." Because through such a conference, the leadership learned about many situations that could not be understood in the past, heard many opinions and criticisms that could not be heard in the past, and was supervised by the broad masses and Party organizations.
    It is of course very good for the leadership to be able to be determined to promote democracy and listen to bottom-up criticism. But if there is only the determination to listen to criticism, and no determination to solve the problems raised by the masses, the political enthusiasm and work enthusiasm of the masses cannot be sustained and consolidated. If the masses see that the shortcomings they have pointed out have begun to be overcome, the staff they have criticized have begun to change their style, and the rationalization proposals they have put forward have been adopted and put into practice, they will more actively engage in selfless labor for the cause of socialist construction. Therefore, after fully promoting democracy and carrying out criticism, Party organizations and administrative leaders must be determined to solve the problems raised by the masses.
    However, it is impossible for all the opinions put forward by the masses to be correct and comprehensive, and it is also impossible for every problem raised to be solved. It is also wrong to think that all the opinions put forward by the masses are correct, should be accepted, and should be handled immediately. If this is the case, it is essentially tantamount to abandoning the responsibility of leadership, and is a kind of extreme democratization. The Party organization and administrative leadership must seriously analyze and study the problems and opinions put forward by the masses. For correct opinions, we must resolutely accept and adopt them, not only verbally express acceptance, but also take concrete measures to ensure their realization.
    Some opinions, although correct, cannot be realized immediately, and still need to go through certain steps, or can only be realized under certain circumstances. When dealing with such opinions, the leadership also needs to explain clearly to the masses, and actively try to ensure that these opinions are realized sooner.
    Incorrect opinions put forward by the masses should also be analyzed, and cannot be treated the same. Because some people may have a low level of understanding, some people may have insufficient understanding of the situation, and some people may have one-sided thinking methods, inappropriate attitudes, and radical language... and so on. Regardless of the situation, these all belong to problems in thinking methods. When dealing with such comrades, we cannot simply criticize and blame them for not being realistic in putting forward opinions, but can only patiently educate and explain to them, improve their awareness, and make them realize that the opinions they have put forward are not correct and not comprehensive, and should consciously correct them.
    Of course, among those who put forward incorrect opinions, there may also be a few people who are indeed not kind, do not proceed from work, but proceed from personal interests. These people can be criticized. In general, we should first conduct individual education for them, so that after education, they become aware and conduct self-criticism, so that the problem can be truly solved.
    However, regardless of whether the opinions put forward by the masses are correct or not, there should be an explanation and a resolution. The general branch member meeting of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection did this.
    At the Party member meeting of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, many comrades criticized the Party leadership in the department for not consciously creating enough conditions for promoting democracy, for not paying attention to adopting a method of combining leadership with the masses in handling some specific problems, and for not taking the initiative to solicit and listen to the opinions of the masses deeply enough; they also put forward many opinions on the lack of close relationships between the upper and lower levels within the department, the leadership's failure to grasp ideological leadership work tightly, the lack of cultivation and education of cadres, and the department's welfare issues. Su Mingde, Secretary of the General Party Branch of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (Deputy Director of the General Office), answered each of the opinions raised by the masses in his speech at the meeting. He said that those that could be resolved immediately would be resolved immediately, and the reasons were also explained for those that could not be resolved due to system and conditions; he criticized and educated some comrades who were not at ease with their work, believing that going to work at the grassroots level was the only way to contact reality, and that working in the department was not reality. He also made a self-criticism of the shortcomings in his own leadership work. Therefore, the masses felt that the leadership attached importance to the opinions of the masses and was indeed determined to improve leadership and improve work, and felt satisfied. Other departments have also begun to resolve the problems raised by the masses after the conference. The China Youth Daily originally had a few cadres who were not used reasonably enough, and now adjustments have been made.
    However, relying solely on carrying out criticism at meetings is not very effective in overcoming the bureaucracy of the leadership and improving the democratic life of the department, and the positive factors that have been mobilized cannot always be maintained. To enable the upper and lower levels to communicate frequently, the relationship between the Party and Party members, and the relationship between the Party and non-Party members to be harmonious and seamless, and the life of the department to be full of vitality, it is also necessary to regularize the promotion of democracy and the carrying out of criticism. Therefore, after this conference, a few departments have decided to establish some systems and take some specific measures, such as: regularly holding Party member meetings, reporting and checking work at the meetings, carrying out criticism and self-criticism, especially bottom-up criticism (non-Party comrades can be invited to participate in these meetings appropriately); Party organizations in the department publishing publications or blackboards to carry out criticism and self-criticism; regularly holding meetings of non-Party activists, and "talking heart to heart" with them, listening to their opinions and requests on work, study, and life; The person in charge of the Party organization in the department regularly meets with Party and non-Party comrades, or personally reads and processes their written opinions... and so on. It can be imagined that after these systems and methods are implemented, a new atmosphere will surely appear in the life of our departments!

    只要领导有决心就能开展批评
    星环
    批评和自我批评，对于我们共产党人就好像空气和水一样不可缺少。而批评和自我批评能不能开展、开展得好不好，关键在于领导。这就是领导方面是不是有决心发扬民主，让群众畅所欲言；是不是有决心倾听和接受群众的意见和批评，改进领导、改进工作。只要领导有决心，就能够采取有效的办法发扬民主，鼓励群众开展自下而上的批评；只要领导有决心，就能够找出解决问题的途径和办法。
    这个道理，在中共中央直属机关最近几个月来发扬民主、开展批评和自我批评的实际行动中，又一次得到了证明。
    今年七月间，中共中央直属机关召开了第五次党代表大会。会上，中央直属机关党委书记杨尚昆同志一再强调了“领导同志应该经常地有意识地去培养批评的空气、民主的空气。对提意见的同志要加以鼓励，不要打击。”“作领导工作的同志应对人们提出的意见采取欢迎的态度，要‘闻过则喜’，不要‘闻过则怒’。”因此，在中央直属机关第五次党代表大会以后，青年团中央、全国总工会、中共中央监察委员会等中央直属机关，都先后召开了党代表大会、党员大会或全体工作人员大会等各种不同形式的会议，传达了中央直属机关第五次党代表大会的精神，结合本机关的实际情况，发扬了民主，开展了批评，检查了领导工作。
    中央直属机关，本来就有一些发扬民主的制度，如在各种会议上开展批评和自我批评等等。正由于有这样的制度，机关内的民主生活就比较正常，但是，应该说中央直属机关还有不少单位的民主生活还是不够健全的，批评和自我批评也不是开展得很好的。主要原因是：不少单位的领导同志对于发扬民主的好处还认识不足，不善于运用这些制度，经常主动地、有意识地培养开展批评和自我批评特别是自下而上批评的空气，鼓励群众经常地、大胆地对领导和工作提出批评和建议；只是在运动中才注意发扬民主，才鼓励群众开展自下而上的批评，运动一过，开展批评的空气又稀薄起来。在这种情况下，群众当然也只习惯于在运动中向领导提出批评，而不习惯于在日常工作中对领导实行监督，对领导工作经常提出批评。
    为了克服以往民主生活不健全的缺点和调动机关一切积极因素，这次在中央直属机关第五次党代表大会影响下，不少单位的党和行政领导上，都表示了大胆放手发动群众开展自下而上批评、听取群众意见改进领导、改进工作的决心，对来自下面的批评采取了欢迎、鼓励的态度。比如青年团中央的一些直属单位和全国总工会，在会议开始的时候都提出了：“不管对也好，不对也好，有意见都请讲。”“有啥讲啥，整个会议期间发言不受限制，什么时候讲完什么时候散会。”号召参加会议的党员和非党同志畅所欲言。而且青年团中央书记处罗毅、胡克实等同志和党委会的负责同志都分头参加了所属单位的会议；全国总工会很多领导同志，也亲自听取了群众提出的意见和批评。
    为了能够更广泛地听取群众的意见，了解更多的下情，以帮助领导上克服官僚主义，有些单位，在开党员大会的时候，还吸收了非党同志参加（包括勤杂人员在内），让所有的工作人员都能够有对党对领导表达自己意见、提出批评的机会。
    领导上的决心，大大鼓励了群众开展自下而上批评的勇气和积极性，不少同志（包括党代表、党员和非党同志）把过去不愿意提、不敢提或者是提了以后没有结果的问题都提了出来，大胆地对领导上工作不深入、不了解下情、对干部只使用不培养的官僚主义作风，和党的政治思想领导薄弱、原则性不强等缺点，进行了严肃的批评。对某些领导同志领导作风和领导方法上的缺点，也进行了指名指姓的批评。比如全国总工会的第五次党代表大会上，代表发言的内容比以往四次党代表大会都要深刻，不仅批评了党委的工作，而且指名指姓地对某些负行政领导责任的党员干部提出了批评。青年团中央等机关的青年团员，也都对过去党的组织工作中的关门主义倾向提出了尖锐的批评。
    领导上这样下决心发扬民主、开展批评以后，群众反映很好，不少单位的群众都认为是“历年来第一次”、“这样的大会真正是一次调动积极因素，消除消极因素的大会”。许多非党同志更是欢欣鼓舞，感到能够参加这样的党员大会、能够让自己在这样的会上讲出心里的话，是“毕生的光荣”，表示要更加靠拢组织、更加努力工作，争取将来能够成为党的队伍中的一员。许多领导同志也认为“这次大会对领导、对群众都是一次深刻的教育，使领导上头脑清醒了，眼睛亮了，耳朵灵了。”因为通过这样的大会，使领导上了解了许多过去不能了解的情况，听到了许多过去听不到的意见和批评，受到了广大群众和党组织的监督。
    领导上能够下决心发扬民主，听取自下而上的批评，这种做法当然很好。但是如果光有决心听取批评，而没有决心解决群众所提出来的问题，群众的政治热情和工作积极性还是不能持久和巩固的。如果群众看到他所指出的缺点已经着手克服，他所批评的工作人员已经开始改变作风，他提出来的合理化建议，已经被采纳并被付诸实施，他就会更加积极地为社会主义建设事业进行忘我的劳动。因此，在充分发扬民主、开展批评以后，党组织和行政领导上一定要下决心解决群众提出来的问题。
    但是，群众提出的意见不可能都是正确的、全面的，提出的问题也不可能每一个都能解决，如果认为群众提出的意见都是正确的，都要接受，而且都要马上办好，这也是不对的。如果这样，实质上就等于放弃了领导的责任，是一种极端民主化的思想。对于群众所提出的问题和意见，党组织和行政领导，必须认真加以分析研究。对于正确的意见，要坚决接受、采纳，不仅在口头上表示接受，而且要采取具体措施保证它的实现。
    有的意见虽然是正确的，但并不是可以立刻实现的，还需要经过一定的步骤，或者是只有在某种情况下才能实现。在处理这类意见的时候，领导上也需要向群众交代清楚，并且积极设法保证这些意见的早些实现。
    对于群众提出的不正确的意见也应该进行分析，不能一律看待。因为其中有的人可能是由于认识水平不高，有的人可能是对情况了解不足，有的人则是思想方法片面、态度不适当、言语偏激……等等。不管是那种情况，这些都是属于思想方法上的问题。对待这样的同志，不能简单地批评、责备他们提意见不实事求是等等，而只能耐心地对他们进行教育、解释，提高他们的觉悟，使他们认识到自己提的意见不正确，不全面，应当自觉地来改正。
    当然，在那些提出不正确意见的人中，也可能有少数人确实不是与人为善，不是从工作出发，而是从个人利益出发。对于这种人，可以进行批评。在一般情况下还是对他们先进行个别教育，让他们经过教育以后，觉悟起来进行自我批评，这样才能真正解决问题。
    不过，不管群众提出的意见正确不正确，都应该要有交代、有着落。这次中共中央监察委员会的总支党员大会就做到了这一点。
    在中共中央监察委员会的党员大会上，很多同志对机关党的领导上在发扬民主方面有意识地创造条件不够，在处理一些具体问题上没有注意采取领导与群众相结合的方法，主动地、深入地征求和倾听群众的意见不够提出了批评；对机关内部上下关系不够密切，领导上对思想领导工作抓得不紧，对干部的培养、教育不够以及机关的生活福利问题，也提出了不少意见。对于群众提出的意见，中共中央监察委员会党总支书记（办公厅副主任兼）苏明德同志，在大会的发言中都一一做了答复。可以立即解决的表示要立即解决，限于制度和条件不能解决的，也说清了原因；对于一些同志不安心工作、认为到下面去工作才是接触实际、机关工作就不是实际工作的思想，进行了批判和教育。对于他自己领导工作中的缺点，也作了自我检讨。因此，群众体会到领导上对群众意见是重视的，确实是下了决心要改进领导、改进工作，感到满意。其他机关在大会以后，也已开始着手解决群众提出的问题。中国青年报社原来有少数干部使用得不够合理，现在已经作了调整。
    但是，光靠在会议上开展批评，对于克服领导上的官僚主义，健全机关的民主生活还不是很有效的，已经被调动起来的积极因素还是不能经常保持。要使上下能够经常通气，党与党员、党与非党关系能够融洽无间，机关生活能够经常充满生气，还必须把发扬民主、开展批评经常化起来。因此，这次大会以后，已有少数机关决定建立一些制度和采取一些具体措施，如：定期召开党员大会，在会上报告和检查工作，开展批评和自我批评特别是自下而上的批评（这种大会可以适当地邀请非党同志参加）；机关党组织出版刊物或黑板报，开展批评和自我批评；定期召开非党积极分子会，和他们“谈心”，听取他们对工作、学习和生活的意见和要求；机关党组织负责人定期接见党和非党同志，或者亲自阅读和处理他们的书面意见……等等。可以设想，这些制度和办法实现以后，我们的机关生活一定会出现一片新气象！
