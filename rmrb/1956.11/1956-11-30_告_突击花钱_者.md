    A Word to the "Spending Spree" Perpetrators
    "A Purchaser's Words" speaks of another situation where the interests of a small group are put before the overall picture.
    Among the leading comrades in certain units, there exists a serious departmentalism: the state's money, once in their hands, seems to become the "property of the small collective." If it's not used up, they are unwilling to hand it over, and they try every possible way to spend it quickly. Thus, the phenomenon of year-end "spending sprees" arises, where valuable funds are recklessly used to buy things that are not needed for the time being. The result of competing to spend money on buying things not only creates artificial tension in the market, but also causes the stockpiling and waste of many materials.
    Speaking of it, it seems everyone knows this is wrong. However, year after year, people still do it. Those who do this may even think that they are doing it for the "public good" and not for "private gain." In fact, isn't this just deceiving themselves!
    The leading comrades of all units should take the initiative to examine and stop this practice. Purchasing personnel should refuse to find "outlets" for surplus funds, and should boldly report problems, helping the state to plug this hole of wasted resources. Actively competing in the "skill of spending money" is certainly wrong, but merely being "hesitant and difficult" is also wrong.

### 告“突击花钱”者

    告“突击花钱”者
    “一个采购员的话”，说的是又一种只顾小集体，不顾大局的事情。
    在某些单位的领导同志中间存在着严重的本位主义思想：国家的钱，到了他们手里，好像变了“小集体所有”的了。用不完也不愿上交，想尽办法要把它赶快花掉。因此，就产生了年终“突击花钱”的现象，把宝贵的资金胡乱买些暂时并不需要的东西。争先花钱买东西的结果，不仅造成市场上人为的紧张，也造成了许多物资的积压和浪费。
    说起来，似乎谁也知道这样做不对。可是，年复一年，人们还是这样做。这样做的人很可能还满以为自己是为“公”，不是为“私”。其实，这想法还不是自己骗自己！
    各单位的领导同志应该主动地检查和制止这种做法。采购人员应该拒绝为结余款去找“出路”，要大胆地检举，帮助国家堵塞这一个浪费资财的洞口。积极地比赛“花钱的本领”固然不对，只是“犹疑为难”也是不对的。
