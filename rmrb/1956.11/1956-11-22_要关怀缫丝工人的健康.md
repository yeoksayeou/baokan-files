    To Care for the Health of Filature Workers

    Currently, among the more than 10,000 filature workers in Zhejiang Province, about 2,000 are often ill and unable to work. According to statistics from five large factories, the average absenteeism rate in the first half of 1956 was about 10%, double that of the first half of 1954.

    The main ailment suffered by filature workers is fatigue, accounting for one-third of all sick leave. Workers generally report: "Can't hold on anymore," "My hands shake as soon as I enter the factory, and after work I have headaches, blurred vision, and weak limbs. I don't want to do anything but rest," "I wake up feeling pain all over my body and it's very uncomfortable," "The filature factory is too intense, too tiring." Many workers' physical condition is beginning to decline. Other common ailments include pulmonary tuberculosis, chronic gastroenteritis, bronchitis, menstrual problems, and pregnancy reactions. In addition, the number of workers suffering from neuralgia, erysipelas (streptococcal skin infection), arthritis, and rheumatism is also increasing year by year.

    As a result, the weight of female filature workers is decreasing year by year. According to a survey of 100 workers at the Jiaxing No. 1 Silk Factory, 58 of them weighed less in 1956 than in 1955, with an average weight loss of 2.5 kilograms. Due to frequent overwork, female workers have poor appetites. According to a survey, female filature workers used to eat 500-625 grams of rice per day, but now they eat only 400-500 grams on average. Insufficient nutrition has led to an increase in anemia cases. Among veteran workers at the Zhejiang No. 2 Silk Factory, 94.7% have mild to moderate anemia. Miscarriages caused by physical weakness and fatigue have also increased.

    Why is the health of filature workers gradually declining, and why is the absenteeism rate increasing?

    First, filature factories are backward semi-manual industries. In recent years, apart from the promotion of some advanced experience in operation, there has been very little improvement in machinery and equipment. Silk production is increased by increasing the speed of the machines. This year in particular, administrative leaders have one-sidedly considered favorable factors. Under the guidance of the idea that "increasing the speed of the machines will not affect quality," they have regarded increasing the speed as the only "good way" to complete the plan. Filature is semi-manual production; the machinery only serves to wind the silk. The result of increasing the speed is to increase the frequency with which workers have to add ends (i.e., add cocoons) and stop the reeling, thus increasing the intensity of the workers' labor. For example, when the Jiaxing No. 1 Silk Factory was reeling AA-grade raw silk from Fuxingzhuang raw material cocoons, the machine speed was 24 revolutions per minute faster than planned (an increase of about 30%), and the number of ends added per minute was 50% higher than the standard specified in the trial reeling. Workers reported: "The machines are as fast as flying. During production, our eyes never leave the silk, and our hands never leave the cocoons. We don't even have time to drink tea or wipe away sweat." In such intense labor, those with poor skills and weak bodies cannot keep up.

    Second, filature factories have poor working conditions. The workshops are hot and humid, the air is polluted, and there is a lack of oxygen. This summer, the total number of machine-hours lost due to high temperatures in filature factories throughout the province reached 396,870. People even fainted in some workshops. In winter, some factories have such high humidity that you can't see the person in front of you. The workers' hair is wet, and the air is polluted, causing workers to feel dizzy and lightheaded. The workers say that the workshops are "water prisons." Long-term production under such labor conditions can lead to arthritis, rheumatism, neuralgia and other diseases. According to statistics from the Hangzhou Fuhua Silk Factory from July to November last year, there were 636 cases of these diseases. Insufficient lighting is also a serious problem. For example, in the Hangzhou Qingcheng Silk Factory, the lighting at the heads of the silk threads in the filature workshops is a maximum of 25 lux and a minimum of only 6 lux, far from the 75-100 lux standard stipulated by the higher authorities, seriously affecting the workers' eyesight.

    Third, workers do not get enough rest. Although the working hours of silk factory workers have been gradually reduced from 11 hours to 9 hours for day shifts and 8 hours for night shifts since liberation, the machine speeds are fast, the quality requirements are high, and production is year-round. In addition, there are many meetings, which excessively occupy the workers' spare time. The workers have very little time to rest. Some even have to attend meetings during their 15-minute breaks. Workers participating in cultural studies often sacrifice sleep to catch up on homework and prepare for exams.

    In addition, poor factory food, poor accommodation, and a lack of recreational activities are also important factors affecting workers' health.

    The decline in physical fitness and the increase in absenteeism among filature workers in Zhejiang are very serious. If this situation is allowed to continue, it will not only threaten the lives of the workers but also be detrimental to the development of the filature industry. It is hoped that the leading departments of the Zhejiang filature industry will take effective measures to improve the working conditions and care for the lives of the workers while developing production.

### 要关怀缫丝工人的健康

    要关怀缫丝工人的健康
    目前浙江全省一万多缫丝工人中，经常有二千人左右卧病不能生产。根据五个大厂的统计，1956年上半年的缺勤率平均为10％左右，比1954年上半年增加一倍。
    缫丝工人害的主要是疲劳病，占总病假的三分之一。职工普遍反映：“撑不住了”、“进工厂就两手发抖，下了工场头痛、眼花、四肢无力，不想活动，只想休息”、“一觉醒来遍身疼痛，十分难受”、“缫丝厂太紧张了，太辛苦了”。许多工人的体质开始下降。其次是肺结核、慢性肠胃炎、支气管炎、月经病及妊娠反应等。此外，患神经痛、丹毒（流火）、关节炎、风湿症的工人也逐年增加。
    这样，缫丝女工的体重逐年下降。据嘉兴中丝一厂对一百个工人的调查，其中1956年比1955年体重下降的有五十八人，平均减轻五市斤。由于经常过度疲劳，女工们食欲不振。据调查缫丝女工过去每天吃大米十四两至一斤，现在平均只吃八到十两；营养不够，患贫血的增多。浙江制丝二厂老工人中轻度和中度贫血的占94.7％。因体弱疲劳而引起流产的亦增加。
    为什么缫丝工人的健康水平逐渐下降，缺勤率上升呢？
    一、缫丝厂是落后的半手工业生产的行业，几年来除了操作方面推广了一些先进经验外，机器设备极少改进。丝的产量是依靠提高车速来增加的。特别是今年行政领导上片面考虑有利因素，在“车速加快不会影响质量”的思想指导下，把增加车速当作完成计划的唯一“好办法”。缫丝是半手工生产，机械只起到卷取的作用，加快车速的结果，就增加了工人操作中的添绪（即添茧子）次数和弃丝停?时间，因而就增加了工人的劳动强度。如嘉兴中丝一厂缫制复兴庄口原料茧AA级生丝时，每分钟车速就比计划快二十四转（约增加30％左右），每分钟添绪次数比试缫规定的标准多50％。工人反映：“车速如飞，生产时眼不离绪，手不离茧，连喝口茶、揩把汗的工夫都没有了。”在这样紧张的劳动中，技术差的和身体弱的就坚持不了。
    二、缫丝厂劳动条件差。车间里高温、高湿，空气混浊，氧气不足。今年夏季全省缫丝厂高温停工高达三十九万六千八百七十个台时，有的车间里还晕倒人。在冬天，有的厂湿度高得对面不见人，工人头发上都是水，空气混浊，工人头昏脑胀。工人们说“车间是‘水牢’”。在这样的劳动条件下长期生产，就会患关节炎、风湿症及神经痛等疾病。据杭州福华丝厂去年7至11月份的统计，发生这些病的即有六百三十六人次。照明度不足现象也相当严重，如杭州庆成丝厂缫丝车绪头上照明度最高二十五个勒克斯，最低仅六个勒克斯，跟上级规定的七十五——一百个勒克斯的标准，相差很远，严重的影响了工人的视力。
    三、工人得不到充分的休息，解放后丝厂工人的工作时间虽然已由十一小时逐步减少至日班九小时，夜班八小时，但车速快，质量要求高，又是长年生产，加上会议多，过多的侵占职工的业余时间，职工休息的时间很少，有的甚至连在工间休息的十五分钟里还得开会。参加文化学习的工人们，为了赶作业和准备考试常常牺牲了睡眠时间。
    此外，工厂伙食办得不好，住宿条件差，文娱活动不开展等也是影响工人健康的重要原因。
    浙江缫丝工人中体质下降、缺勤率上升的情况是很严重的，如果听任这种情况发展下去，不仅威胁着工人的生命，而且对缫丝工业的发展，也是很不利的。希望浙江缫丝工业领导部门在发展生产的同时，也要采取有效措施改善职工的劳动条件，关心职工生活。　津蕾
