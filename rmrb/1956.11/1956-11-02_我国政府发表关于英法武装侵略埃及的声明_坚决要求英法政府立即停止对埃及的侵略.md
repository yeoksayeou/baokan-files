Xinhua News Agency, November 1st – The Government of the People's Republic of China today issued a statement on the Anglo-French armed aggression against Egypt. The full text is as follows:

	Just as the whole world was eagerly expecting that the issue of freedom of navigation in the Suez Canal would be resolved through peaceful negotiation based on the principles recently adopted by the United Nations Security Council, on October 30, 1956, Britain and France, under the pretext of Israel's armed invasion of Egypt, issued an ultimatum demanding that the Egyptian government agree to the entry of British and French troops into the Suez Canal ports, and then took armed aggressive action on October 31. Britain and France instigated Israel to launch a large-scale armed offensive against Egypt, and then used this offensive as a pretext to attempt to seize the Suez Canal region by force. This is not only a serious provocation against the Egyptian people, but also a serious provocation against all peace-loving countries and people in Asia, Africa, and the world. Due to the conspiracy and open provocation by Britain and France, the cause of peace, which is cherished by hundreds of millions of people around the world, has suffered a serious threat. The Chinese government strongly condemns this blatant act of aggression by the British and French governments and firmly supports the Egyptian people's sacred struggle to defend national sovereignty and national independence.

	Peaceful resolution of the Suez Canal issue is the unanimous wish of people all over the world, including the people of Britain and France. However, the British and French governments have consistently attempted to use armed force to force Egypt to accept demands that infringe upon Egyptian sovereignty and independence. After the United Nations Security Council adopted the principles for a peaceful resolution of the Suez Canal issue, the Egyptian government repeatedly suggested immediate negotiations based on these principles. However, the British and French governments have consistently rejected this reasonable suggestion, preventing negotiations from taking place. Not only that, the British and French governments have continued to mobilize their armed forces, threatening Egypt with force, and have never stopped instigating Israel to carry out armed provocations against Arab countries. The blatant acts of aggression currently taken by the British and French governments completely expose their conspiracy to reject peaceful consultation and deliberately use force on the Suez Canal issue.

	It must be pointed out that the policy of aggression and war against Egypt pursued by the British and French governments, disregarding the opposition of peace-loving and just people around the world, is a "playing with fire and getting burned" policy. The Egyptian people, who are determined to safeguard their sovereignty and independence, are by no means isolated in their heroic struggle. Arab countries, Asian and African countries, and all peace-loving and just countries and people will never allow colonial rule to be re-established in Egypt. Even the peace-loving people of Britain and France themselves will resolutely oppose the unjust act of aggression against Egypt. China, together with all peace-loving and just countries and people, firmly demands that the British and French governments immediately cease their aggression against Egypt, stop armed provocations against Arab countries, and conduct peaceful consultations on the Suez Canal issue without further delay. If the British and French colonialists insist on implementing their policies of aggression and war, they will inevitably reap the bitter fruit of their own actions.

### 我国政府发表关于英法武装侵略埃及的声明  坚决要求英法政府立即停止对埃及的侵略

    我国政府发表关于英法武装侵略埃及的声明
    坚决要求英法政府立即停止对埃及的侵略
    新华社1日讯　中华人民共和国政府今天发表关于英、法武装侵略埃及的声明。全文如下：
    正当全世界殷切地期待苏伊士运河航行自由的问题将根据联合国安全理事会最近通过的各项原则经由和平协商求得解决的时候，1956年10月30日，英国和法国竟然以以色列武装侵入埃及为借口，用最后通牒的形式，要求埃及政府同意英、法军队进驻苏伊士运河港口，并且跟着在10月31日采取了武装侵略的行动。英、法唆使以色列向埃及发动了大规模的武装进攻，又利用这种进攻为借口，企图武装夺取苏伊士运河地区，这不仅是对埃及人民的严重挑衅，而且也是对亚非和全世界一切爱好和平的国家和人民的严重挑衅。由于英、法的阴谋策动和公开挑衅，世界亿万人民所珍贵的和平事业已经遭受到严重的威胁。中国政府强烈地谴责英、法两国政府这种赤裸裸的侵略行为，坚决地支持埃及人民维护国家主权和民族独立的神圣斗争。
    和平解决苏伊士运河问题是全世界人民包括英、法两国人民在内的一致的愿望，但是英、法两国政府却一直企图凭借武装力量强迫埃及接受侵犯埃及主权和独立的要求。联合国安全理事会通过和平解决苏伊士运河问题的原则后，埃及政府已经一再建议根据这些原则，立即进行谈判。但是，英、法两国政府却始终拒绝这一合理的建议，使谈判至今没有能够举行。不仅如此，英、法两国政府还继续调动它们的武装部队，对埃及进行武力威胁，而且始终没有停止唆使以色列向阿拉伯国家进行武装挑衅的活动。英、法两国政府当前所采取的露骨的侵略行为完全暴露了它们在苏伊士运河问题上拒绝和平协商、蓄意使用武力的阴谋。
    必须指出，英、法两国政府不顾全世界爱好和平和正义的人民的反对，对埃及实行侵略和战争的政策，是“玩火自焚”的政策。坚决维护自己的主权和独立的埃及人民在他们的英勇斗争中绝不是孤立的。阿拉伯国家、亚非国家和一切爱好和平和正义的国家和人民决不会容许殖民主义的统治重新在埃及建立起来。就是英、法本国爱好和平的人民，也将会坚决反对侵略埃及的不义行为。中国同一切爱好和平和正义的国家和人民一起，坚决要求英、法政府立即停止对埃及的侵略，制止对阿拉伯国家的武装挑衅，并且不再迟延地就苏伊士运河问题进行和平协商。如果英、法殖民主义者坚持执行它们的侵略政策和战争政策，那么，它们必将自食其恶果。
