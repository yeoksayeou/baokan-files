    A Superfluous Act

    It is said that on the 15th, the U.S. Department of Defense issued a so-called "protest" to Britain and France, the reason being that Britain and France used American military aid to attack Egypt, thereby violating the "agreement signed between the U.S. and Britain and France."

    In fact, if it wasn't for deception, this "protest" would be completely superfluous and clumsily executed. Britain and France, these two declining colonial powers, have only managed to barely maintain some of their former prestige in the eleven years since the war thanks to U.S. military aid; otherwise, they would have long been driven back to London and Paris from places like Algeria and Malaya.

    According to the United Press International on the 15th, in the past six years alone, the United States has spent 3.6 billion U.S. dollars on military equipment and supplies to support France, and about 1 billion U.S. dollars to support Britain. In the past, the United States has always said that its so-called "military aid" to Britain, France, and other military bloc countries was only for "defense" purposes. Now, Britain and France are using American weapons to slaughter the Egyptian people. How does the United States explain this? Can this be considered "defense"?

    When the war of aggression against Egypt first broke out, people saw from newspaper reports that British and French troops were using American weapons. At that time, the U.S. Department of Defense did not say a word. Now that thousands of Egyptians have died under American weapons, the U.S. Department of Defense comes out to "protest." What is the use of this? Can this absolve the United States of its responsibility for condoning aggression? (Chao)

    多此一举
    据说，美国国防部在15日向英、法提出了一个所谓“抗议”，原因是英国和法国用了美国的军事援助进攻埃及，破坏了“美国同英、法签订的协定”。
    其实，如果不是为了骗人的话，这个“抗议”是完全多余的，做得也太笨拙了。英、法这两个殖民主义破落户，在战后十一年中，就亏着美国的军事援助，才勉强撑持着一点往日的威风；否则，它们早就从阿尔及利亚、马来亚等地被赶回伦敦和巴黎去了。
    据合众社15日说，仅过去六年中，美国就花了三十六亿美元军事装备和物资支持法国，花了十亿美元左右支持英国。过去美国一直是说，它对英法和其它军事集团国家的所谓“军事援助”，只是为了“防御”之用的。现在，英法拿了美国的武器来屠杀埃及人民，美国究竟作何解释呢？难道这算作是“防御”吗？
    在侵略埃及战争刚发生的时候，人们就从报纸消息中看到，英法军队使用了美国武器。当时，美国国防部一声不吭。等到成千的埃及人已经死在美国武器下面，美国国防部才出来“抗议”一下，这顶什么用呢？难道这就能够推脱美国纵容侵略的责任吗？（超）
