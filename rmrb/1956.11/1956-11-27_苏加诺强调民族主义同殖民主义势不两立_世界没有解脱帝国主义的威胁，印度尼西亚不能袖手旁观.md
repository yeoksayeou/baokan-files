Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, November 26th: President Sukarno, in a speech in Surabaya, pointed out that nationalism is incompatible with colonialism.

Sukarno delivered two speeches to students of Airlangga University and members of the armed forces in Surabaya on November 24th and 25th.

He said that nationalism and colonialism are irreconcilable enemies because colonialism relies on colonies for its survival. Therefore, if the world is to be spared the scourge of war, this issue should be regarded as the most fundamental one.

Speaking of Indonesia's independent policy, the President said that independence cannot be equated with neutrality. Neutrality expresses a passive attitude, an attitude of indifference to international affairs. We cannot stand idly by because the world has not yet escaped the threat of imperialism and colonialism. And the fact is that as long as colonialism exists, there is no peace in the world.

He said that Roosevelt's Four Freedoms should be supplemented by one: the freedom for every nation to establish a country. Without this freedom, lasting tranquility cannot be achieved. With this freedom achieved, coexistence can be realized.

Talking about democracy, the President said that we should not copy others, but should explore the democracy that has long been rooted in our own society. This democracy is guided democracy, not blind democracy. The President hopes that the future constitution should reflect the attitudes and views of the Indonesian people, in short, it should formulate a constitution with national characteristics.

President Sukarno spoke of how he saw the people of socialist countries enthusiastically engaged in construction during his visits abroad. He said that one of the lessons he learned from this visit was that if we are to talk about construction, the most important thing is to establish heavy industry, especially the steel industry. Sukarno said: "Mao Zedong once frankly pointed this out to me. And I saw in Anshan that Mao Zedong's words had become a reality."

Speaking of the armed forces, Sukarno accused that some elements are now doing illegal things and are defiling the sacred goal of the armed forces - loyalty to the Republic of Indonesia, which declared independence in 1945.

He said that the Soviet and Chinese armies understand what military ethics are and what the officer's code is. Their soldiers understand why they are soldiers, and without exception, they have become the driving force for realizing national ideals. They have lofty ideals.

    苏加诺强调民族主义同殖民主义势不两立
    世界没有解脱帝国主义的威胁，印度尼西亚不能袖手旁观
    新华社雅加达26日电　苏加诺总统在泗水演讲时指出，民族主义同殖民主义是不相容的。
    苏加诺11月24日和25日在泗水对埃兰加大学学生和武装部队人员作了两次演讲。
    他说，民族主义和殖民主义是不共戴天的，因为殖民主义是依靠殖民地而生存的。因此，如果要使世界免遭战争灾害，应当把这问题视为最基本的问题。
    在谈到印度尼西亚所奉行的自主政策时，总统说，自主是不能同中立相提并论的，中立是表现不积极的态度，是对国际大事不闻不问的态度。我们不能袖手旁观，因为世界还没有解脱帝国主义和殖民主义的威胁。而事实也是这样，当殖民主义还存在时，世界是没有和平可言的。
    他说，罗斯福的四大自由应加上一条：每个民族有建立国家的自由。如果没有这个自由，就不能实现永久的安宁。实现了这种自由，就可以实现共处。
    谈到民主，总统说，我们不应抄袭别人的，而是应该发掘久已生根于本国社会中的民主。这个民主就是有领导的民主，而不是盲目的民主。总统希望未来的宪法应当反映印度尼西亚人民生活的态度和观点，简单地说就是应当制订一部具有本民族特点的宪法。
    苏加诺总统谈到他在国外访问时看到社会主义国家人民是怎样地热心进行建设。他说，他从这次访问中所获教益之一就是，如果要谈建设，那么最重要的是建立重工业，特别是钢铁工业。苏加诺说：“毛泽东曾经坦白对我指出这点。而我在鞍山就看到毛泽东的话已经变为现实。”
    在谈到武装部队问题的时候，苏加诺指责说，现在，有些分子要做犯法的事，要玷污武装部队的神圣目标——忠于1945年宣布独立的印度尼西亚共和国。
    他说，苏联、中国军队懂得什么是军人道德，什么是军官守则。它们的兵士明白是为了什么当兵，他们毫无例外地都成为实现国家理想的推动力。他们有崇高的理想。
