    "Excavation" and "Development"
    Shao Ruo
    Vigorously excavating local opera genres and extensively unearthing the rich traditional repertoire inherent in each genre is a major task in inheriting the national opera heritage. In addition, considering and discussing the future direction of our national opera is about how to unleash creativity on the existing foundation to make our "flowers" bloom more prosperously and luxuriantly. Today's "excavation" is precisely for tomorrow's "development." Everyone understands this principle. But I feel that at the current stage, excavation work is more important. Currently, "excavation" is not only a prerequisite or process for "development," but it also plays a role in "development" itself.
    For example, when we excavate an ancient opera genre or several repertoires from a certain genre, isn't it similar to our archaeologists or geological exploration teams discovering antiquities or new mineral deposits? Something that was originally unnoticed or even on the verge of extinction is now rescued and brought back to life, isn't that development? A neglected play or a unique skill that was originally known only to one person is now known to everyone, isn't that development? Today we only have one Mei Lanfang, but in the near future we may have ten Mei Lanfangs, and one or two of these ten new Mei Lanfangs will inevitably surpass their peers – which also means surpassing today's Mei Lanfang, isn't that development? Today, the so-called "excavation" is actually "development," and "development" is inherently embedded in "excavation."
    However, even with the current vigorous efforts, our excavation work on opera art still inevitably suffers from neglecting one thing while attending to another, and abandoning the near in pursuit of the far. It is not enough to rely solely on "laymen" to record the performance art or script lines of a certain artist; it mainly relies on having successors. Taking Peking Opera as an example, who are the successors of Mei Lanfang or Gai Jiaotian? We are glad that Mei Lanfang developed the stage art of his predecessors such as Mei Qiaoling, Hu Xilu, Shi Xiaofu, Chen Delin, and Wang Yaoqing, but we also regret and mourn the lack of successors after the deaths of predecessors such as Yang Xiaolou, Yu Shuyan, and Ma Decheng. We are even more worried about whether today's Mei Lanfang, Gai Jiaotian, Xiao Changhua, Zhou Xinfang, Hao Shouchen, as well as Ma Lianliang, Xiao Cuihua, Sun Yukun, Hou Xirui, and Qian Baosen will have successors to inherit their mantles! Taking Mr. Mei as an example, in theory, he enjoys world renown and often lives in Beijing, so it seems that there is no question of whether to excavate him or not. However, if we only focus on preserving seven or eight of his programs, but overlook seventy or eighty, or even one hundred and seventy or eighty programs, how should we account for this? I believe that we should use recordings or records to record every section of singing and recitation of all the programs that Mr. Mei knows; have dedicated personnel with a relatively solid foundation be responsible for consulting Mr. Mei, and master some important body movements and performances; make a written analysis of some "Mei School" singing methods, recitation methods, movements, and principles for practicing basic skills; and at the same time cultivate new forces to reproduce and improve these arts from concrete practice… These are all urgent matters. And for those older than Mr. Mei, in poorer health than Mr. Mei, and those old artists who possess unique skills but have not yet attracted people's attention, the "excavation" work of their art is even more urgent! Leaving aside these urgent and concrete tasks and engaging in empty talk about "development," I think is not very relevant to the current actual situation.

    “发掘”和“发展”
    少若
    大力发掘各个地方的剧种，大量发掘每一剧种所蕴藏的丰富的传统剧目，是继承民族戏曲遗产方面的重大工作；另外，考虑并讨论祖国戏曲今后发展的方向，则是在现有的基础上如何发挥创造性，使我们的“花”开放得更繁荣、更茂盛的问题。今天的“发掘”，正是为了明天的“发展”。这个道理谁都明白。但我觉得在现阶段，发掘工作是更主要的。在目前，“发掘”不仅是“发展”的前提或过程而已，它本身就起着“发展”的作用。
    比如，我们发掘出来一个古老的剧种或某一剧种中的若干剧目，这不同我们的考古学家或地质勘探队发现了古物或新的矿藏相类似么？本来是不被人注意的、甚至濒于绝种的东西，今天居然被人抢救下来使之死而复苏，这不就是发展么？一本冷戏或一招绝技，本来只有一个人会，现在让大家都会了，这不就是发展么？今天我们只有一位梅兰芳，但不久的将来我们可能有十位梅兰芳，而这十位新的梅兰芳中又必然有一两个能超越侪辈——当然也就等于说超越了今天的梅兰芳，这不就是发展么？在今天，所谓“发掘”实即“发展”，“发展”本来就寓于“发掘”之中的。
    但我们对戏曲艺术的发掘工作，即使在目前的大力开展下，仍不免有顾此失彼、舍近求远的情况。单靠“外行”去记录某一艺人的表演艺术或剧本台词是不够的，主要还靠有传人。即以京剧而言，谁是梅兰芳或盖叫天的传人呢？我们为梅兰芳发展了梅巧玲、胡喜禄、时小福、陈德霖、王瑶卿等先辈的舞台艺术而庆幸，但我们也为杨小楼、余叔岩、马德成等先辈的死后无传人而惋惜悼痛；我们更为今天的梅兰芳、盖叫天、萧长华、周信芳、郝寿臣以至于马连良、小翠花、孙毓坤、侯喜瑞、钱宝森这些老辈的衣钵传人之有无而担心！就以梅先生为例吧，照理说，他享有世界声誉，又经常住在北京，对于他，似乎无所谓发掘不发掘的问题了。然而如果只注意保留了他的七八个节目，却遗漏了七八十个甚至一百七八十个节目，这笔账又该怎么算呢？我认为，用录音或制唱片的办法，应有尽有地把梅先生所会的全部节目的每一段唱、念都记录下来；由比较有根基的专人负责向梅先生请教，把一些重要的身段、表演都熟练地学会；把一些“梅派”的唱法、念法、动作以及练基本功的原则做出书面的分析，一面更培养新生力量使这些艺术从具体的实践中再现而有所提高……这些都是刻不容缓的事了。而对那些年岁高于梅先生的，健康逊于梅先生的，以及虽身怀绝艺而尚未引起人们重视的老辈们，进行艺术的“发掘”工作，就更其刻不容缓了！离开这些刻不容缓的具体工作，而空谈什么“发展”，我想是不大切合当前的实际情况的。
