Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 24th: In order to ensure electricity consumption for production and construction, the people of Chongqing are actively participating in electricity conservation efforts. Lighting at sports fields of over two hundred factories, mines, enterprises, and government offices throughout the city have been temporarily suspended at night. Factories and mines are generally adjusting production schedules, making every effort to utilize the hours with lower electricity consumption, such as midday and the second half of the night, for production. According to statistics from seventeen large factories, after implementing this measure, the peak electricity load on the Chongqing-Changshou power grid during the first half of the night, when electricity consumption was most concentrated, can be reduced by 4,000 kilowatts.

Twenty-five factories with high electricity consumption have already formulated electricity conservation measures and plans. Once these measures are implemented, factories and mines throughout the city can save at least three million kilowatt-hours of electricity. Many units have already started planning. After these measures are implemented, factories and mines throughout the city can save at least three million kilowatt-hours of electricity. Many units have already begun to promote advanced experiences in reducing electricity consumption per unit of product. In the third quarter of this year, the Shashi Cotton Mill reduced electricity consumption per bale of yarn to below 200 kilowatt-hours by appropriately reducing spindle speed, avoiding idling, strengthening cleaning, and using thin spindle oil, creating a new city-wide record for electricity conservation per bale of yarn. Currently, textile mills throughout the city have successively sent personnel to the Shashi Cotton Mill to learn from their experience in conserving electricity. After the Hua Yi Paper Mill promoted the advanced experience of the Yibin 602 Paper Mill in October, electricity consumption per ton of bleached bamboo pulp also decreased by 57 kilowatt-hours.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 24th: According to statistics from the Shanghai Electric Power Administration Bureau, in the first three quarters of this year, Shanghai's industrial electricity consumption was reduced by more than 43 million kilowatt-hours compared to the same period last year. It is estimated that a total of 60 million kilowatt-hours can be saved by the end of the year.

Many large factories have launched inter-factory competitions for safe and economical electricity use this year, and electrical workers in various steel mills have also launched competitions within their trades. Many factories have seen numerous advanced experiences in electricity conservation.

    保证生产建设的需要
    重庆上海机关企业节约用电
    新华社重庆24日电　为了保证生产建设的用电，重庆市人民积极地参加节约用电工作。全市二百多个厂矿、企业、机关的灯光球场，夜间已经暂时停止开放。各厂矿普遍调整生产时间，尽量利用每天中午和下半夜用电较少的时间进行生产。据十七个大型工厂的统计，实行这个措施后，原来用电量最集中的上半夜，便可以降低重庆—长寿电力网的负荷四千瓩。
    有二十五个用电较多的工厂已经拟定了节约用电的措施计划。这些措施实行后，全市各厂矿至少可以节约三百万度电以上。不少单位已经开始规划。这些措施实行后，全市各厂矿至少可以节约三百万度电以上。不少单位已经开始推广降低单位产品耗电量的先进经验。今年第三季度沙市纱厂因为适当降低锭子转速，不开空车，加强清洁工作，采用薄锭子油等等，每件纱的耗电量下降到二百度以下，创造了全市每件纱节约用电的新纪录。现在全市纺织厂都先后派人到沙市纱厂学习节约用电的经验。华一造纸厂在10月份推广宜宾六零二造纸厂的先进经验以后，也使每吨漂白竹浆的耗电量下降了五十七度。
    新华社上海24日电　据上海电业管理局统计：今年前三个季度，上海工业用电量比去年同期节约了四千三百多万度，预计到年底一共可以节约六千万度。
    很多大型工厂今年开展了安全用电和节约用电的厂际竞赛，各钢铁厂的电气工作人员还开展了同工种竞赛。不少工厂都出现了许多节约用电的先进经验。
