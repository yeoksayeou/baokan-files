    There is No "High Voltage" or "Low Voltage" Current
    In the "Factory and Mine Construction Dynamics" column on page two of your newspaper on October 25th, there is a subheading that reads "Transforming High Voltage Current into Low Voltage Current," and the article also states this. I believe this wording is inappropriate. Current is only divided into alternating current and direct current, and from a numerical point of view, it is only divided into large and small. To describe current as "high voltage current" or "low voltage current" is confusing and unscientific. (Shenyang Xu Chengkai)

### 电流并无“高压”、“低压”之分

    电流并无“高压”、“低压”之分
    10月25日你报二版刊登的“厂矿建设动态”栏中，有一个小标题是“把高压电流变成低压电流”，文中也这样说。我认为这种提法是不妥当的。电流只有交流和直流之分，从数值上看也只有大小之分。将电流说成“高压电流”、“低压电流”是令人费解的，而且也是不够科学的。　（沈阳　徐承凯）
