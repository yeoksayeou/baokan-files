Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, November 24th. Hubei Province's government agencies at all levels and their affiliated enterprises are conducting a comprehensive thrift inspection based on instructions from the Provincial People's Committee. Currently, various departments, special districts, most enterprises, and some counties have established thrift inspection organizations primarily composed of monitoring institutions at all levels.

Leaders at all levels and in all units are personally leading this work. Responsible cadres of the Jingzhou Special District and others have repeatedly made mobilization reports to cadres and the masses, quickly launching a mass self-inspection within the agencies. Various departments have adopted methods of reviewing accounts combined with inventorying physical objects and calculating detailed accounts to distinguish between extravagance and waste and rational use. At the same time, local thrift inspection organizations have also adopted methods of focusing on key inspections and conducting roving supervision to supervise and promote comprehensive thrift inspection work.

According to the pilot inspection materials of the province's monitoring agencies, waste is widespread and serious. For example, the backfilling of earth on the Shimen Reservoir Dam project and the Sihu drainage project failed to construct the dam at the designated location, causing a breach. These two items alone caused more than 490,000 yuan in waste, causing twenty local state-owned farms to not only fail to make a profit this year but also lose more than 120,000 yuan. Seven of the farms were inundated by water, which also caused 150,000 jin of grain to rot. Some cadres in the Jingzhou Special District, due to their careless work style, repeatedly used telegrams and telephones to correct or supplement telegram content that had already been sent, resulting in the Jingzhou Special District's original annual telecommunications budget of 150,000 yuan being greatly exceeded to reach more than 220,000 yuan by the end of September. In addition, many agencies and enterprises emphasize extravagance and ostentation, finding various excuses to purchase goods and eat and drink, violating financial regulations, misappropriating public funds, and engaging in petty embezzlement. In addition, a small number of cadres and workers have been found to have engaged in corruption and theft.

According to the person in charge of the Provincial Supervisory Department, the main reason for the above problems is that cadres and workers at all levels lack the concept of careful calculation and thrift and the idea of building the country with diligence and thrift in their work. Therefore, in this anti-waste work, local thrift inspection organizations particularly emphasize earnestly mobilizing the masses to expose and criticize, finding the causes of waste, and on this basis, formulating thrift measures in order to promptly block waste loopholes and prevent extravagance and waste from continuing to occur, thereby establishing a long-term practice of thrift in the vast number of cadres and workers.

### 树立长期厉行节约的风气  湖北各机关企业发动群众反对浪费

    树立长期厉行节约的风气
    湖北各机关企业发动群众反对浪费
    新华社武汉24日电　湖北省各级政府机关和所属企业单位根据省人民委员会的指示，正在进行全面节约的检查工作。目前，各厅局、专署、大部分企业和部分县都先后成立了以各级监察机构为主体的节约检查组织。
    各地、各单位的领导干部都亲自领导这项工作。荆州等专署的负责干部再三为干部群众作动员报告，很快地在机关内部展开了群众性的自查工作，各科室采取了审查账务结合清点实物和算细账的办法，划清了铺张浪费和合理使用的界限。与此同时，各地节约检查组织还采取重点检查和巡回监督的办法来监督和推动全面的节约检查工作。
    根据省各级监察机构试点检查材料表明，浪费现象是普遍而严重的。如石门水库大坝回填土工程和四胡排水工程没按指定地点筑坝造成溃口，仅这两项就造成四十九万多元的浪费，使二十个地方国营农场今年不仅没有盈利，反而亏损了十二万多元。其中的七个农场因遭受水的浸袭，还霉烂了十五万斤粮食。荆州专署某些干部由于有粗枝大叶的作风，三番五次地用电报电话更正或补充已发的电报内容，致使荆州专署原订十五万元的年度电讯费预算，到9月底就大大地超过而达到二十二万多元。还有不少机关、企业讲究阔气排场，找出各种借口去购置物品和吃喝，违反财政制度，挪用公款、搞小家当等。此外，还发现一小部分干部和职工有贪污、盗窃行为。
    据省监察厅负责人谈，产生上述问题的主要原因，是由于各级干部和职工在各种工作中，缺乏精打细算的节约观念和勤俭建国的思想。因此，在此次反浪费工作中，各地节约检查组织特别强调认真发动群众进行揭发、批判，找出浪费的原因，并在此基础上，订出节约办法，以便及时地堵塞浪费漏洞，防止铺张浪费现象继续发生，从而在广大干部和职工群众中树立起长期厉行节约的风气。
