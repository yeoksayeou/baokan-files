Xinhua News Agency, Melbourne, 24th: The first round of the 16th Olympic Games football competition began today. The Soviet team defeated the German team with a score of 2-1.

The team representing Germany in this competition is the original West German team, which was the 1954 World Cup champion.

This was a fiercely contested match between two evenly matched teams, which aroused great interest among the audience. The Soviet team's players were well-positioned and had better ball control, so the ball was often in the German team's area, posing a great threat to the German team. However, the German goalkeeper also performed well, saving many dangerous shots.

The first goal was scored by the Soviet team's left forward twenty minutes after the start of the match. The score at the end of the first half was 1-0. At the start of the second half, the two sides engaged in a back-and-forth battle. Near the end of the match, both the Soviet team and the German team scored a goal each. The Soviet team finally won 2-1.

The Soviet team has already qualified for the second round of the competition.

The featherweight champion was America's Berger, with a total score of 352.5 kilograms (107.5 + 107.5 + 137.5), breaking the Olympic record of 337.5 kilograms and also breaking the world record of 350 kilograms jointly held by Soviet athletes UdoDov and Chemishkian.

Soviet athlete Minaev finished second with a total score of 342.5 kilograms. His jerk was 114.5 kilograms, exceeding his own world record of 114 kilograms.
