Judging by the Name
    Yue An

    This spring, I went to a Pingju opera troupe in a certain county. An actor told me a story:

    Before a performance, the troupe would submit the plays they intended to perform to the Culture Section for approval. Once, when a new performer arrived, the play scheduled for the first day was "Turbulent Times and Mandarin Ducks." It was submitted to the Culture Section in a batch. A cadre in the section hadn't seen this play and didn't even ask about its plot. He simply picked up his pen and wrote two large characters on the playbill: "Disapproved!" Upon inquiry, the reason given was: "Turbulent times producing mandarin ducks must be a yellow (pornographic) play." The actors were stunned. When they tried to explain the plot to him, he repeatedly waved his hand, saying, "I'm busy. Change the play!" The actors had no choice but to leave.

    Back at the troupe, they discussed it. This was the new performer's signature play, and a classic at that. The only problem was the name. So, they decided to change it back to the original name of the play, "Story of Baimuyue (Worshipping the Moon)," hoping it would be approved. Sure enough, as they expected, the culture cadre picked it up, took a look, and said repeatedly, "Good, good. Look how elegant the name is. It must be a good play." He then picked up his pen and wrote "Approved" on the playbill.

    A busybody composed a doggerel:

    Culture cadres review plays with haste,
    Judging meanings by names is their taste;
    Red pen approves only "Worshipping the Moon,"
    "Turbulent Times" forbid "Mandarin Ducks" soon!

    顾名思义
    岳安
    今春，我到某县评剧团去，艺人向我讲了一个故事：
    剧团在演出前把上演的剧目送到文化科去呈请批准。有一次，接个新角来，第一天打炮的戏是“乱世鸳鸯”。送到文化科一批，科里的一位干部没看过这个戏，也没问问这个戏的剧情，即拿起笔来，在戏单上写了两个大字：不准！一打听，原因是：“乱世出鸳鸯，一定是黄色戏。”把艺人说的目瞪口呆，待要向他讲一下剧情，他连连摆手说：“我忙呢，你们另换个戏吧！”艺人无奈，只好告退。
    回到剧团一核计，这是邀来的新角的拿手戏，又是古典名剧，所差的戏名不好，那末，改一下，仍恢复这个戏的原名“拜月记”，也许会批准的。果然不出他们所料，这位文化干部拿起来一看，连说“好，好，你看戏名多么典雅，可见是一出好戏。”遂即拿起笔来在戏单上写了一个“准”字。
    有好事者编了一首打油诗：
    文化干部审戏忙，
    顾名思义做文章；
    红笔只点“双拜月”，
    “乱世”不准出“鸳鸯”！
