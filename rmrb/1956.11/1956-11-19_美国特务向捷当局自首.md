Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 16th. According to a report from the Czechoslovak News Agency: A U.S.-hired spy, Vlats, recently surrendered to the Czechoslovak state organs, and also handed over items such as a pistol and a transceiver.

He said that after receiving special training in the Federal Republic of Germany, he was sent to Czechoslovakia, his mission being to lure Czechoslovak citizens into becoming spies on their own land. He then said: It was only when the fascists carried out terrorist activities in Hungary and the Western countries perfidiously attacked Egypt that I realized that if I still considered myself a Czech, I could no longer be a blind tool of these Western forces, which are also cruelly and systematically hoping to create bloodshed for our people.

Earlier this month, Pansky, a Czechoslovak defector who returned home in August this year, also issued a statement to the Czechoslovak News Agency. He had been in charge of the U.S. fund for Czechoslovak defectors in Vienna. The statement said that he had been in contact with American spies in Vienna for several months, all of whom were personnel of the U.S. Embassy in Vienna.

    美国特务向捷当局自首
    新华社布拉格16日电　据捷克斯洛伐克通讯社报道：美国雇用的一个特务伏拉次最近向捷克斯洛伐克国家机关自首，并且交出了手枪和收发报机等物件。
    他说，他在德意志联邦共和国受了特别训练以后，就被派到捷克斯洛伐克来，他的任务是诱骗捷克斯洛伐克的公民在本国的土地上充当特务。他接着说：只是到了法西斯分子在匈牙利进行恐怖活动和西方国家背信弃义地攻击埃及时，我才体会到，假使我仍然认为自己是一个捷克人的话，我再也不能成为西方这些势力的盲目的工具了，这些势力也正在残酷地和有步骤地希望为我们的人民制造流血事件。
    这个月早些时候，今年8月回国的捷克斯洛伐克逃亡者潘斯基也向捷克斯洛伐克通讯社发表了声明。他曾主持过美国给在维也纳的捷克斯洛伐克逃亡者的基金工作。声明说，他在维也纳与美国间谍有过好几个月的联系，所有这些间谍都是美国驻维也纳大使馆的人员。
