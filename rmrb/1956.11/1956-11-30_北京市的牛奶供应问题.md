    The Milk Supply Problem in Beijing
    Liu Baifeng
    In the past two months, the milk supply situation in Beijing has been very tight. The Beijing Milk Supply Station and some cooperative milk supply stations have generally reduced the milk supply to existing subscribers. Some subscribers have had their original supply reduced by half, while others have had their supply completely stopped. Currently, these milk stations are not accepting new subscribers, and even patients who urgently need milk find it difficult to buy any, no matter how hard they try.
    The main reason for the tight milk supply in Beijing is that the demand for milk from consumers has rapidly increased, while the milk production in Beijing has grown very slowly, failing to keep up with the ever-increasing consumer demand. Taking the Dongdan Milk Station, a state-owned enterprise in Beijing, as an example, the sales volume of milk in October this year increased by 37% compared to the same period last year, while the milk production of the various state-owned farms under its jurisdiction only increased by 9%. Secondly, seasonal milk production of cows and poor management of some dairy factories have also reduced some of the production volume.
    However, in the past two months, many state agencies, organizations, and enterprises have been buying large quantities of milk cows from private milk farmers at high prices, which is also a reason for the tight milk supply.
    The private milk farmers in Beijing joined agricultural production cooperatives during the high tide of socialist transformation. After joining the cooperatives, due to some difficulties in management and life between farmers and milk farmers, a few milk farmers withdrew from the agricultural cooperatives and operated independently. At this time, some agencies, organizations, and enterprise welfare departments, for the convenience of their employees drinking milk, took the opportunity to buy these milk farmers' cows who had withdrawn from the cooperatives at high prices and on the condition of arranging jobs for the milk farmers. According to what is already known, the Hydroelectric Power General Bureau purchased eight cows from seven households who had withdrawn from the Oriental Agricultural Cooperative in the Haidian District, and the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant purchased six cows (many other agencies have not yet been investigated). This has affected the market, reducing the supply of milk by more than 3,000 pounds per day.
    The relevant departments in Beijing had advised these units not to buy milk cows needed by the market. However, these units did not accept this advice. Up to now, the phenomenon of buying milk cows at high prices is still frequently found outside Guang'anmen, in the eastern suburbs, and in Haidian. The Northeast Courtyard outside Guang'anmen has become a black market for milk cow transactions.
    The actions of these units in buying milk cows at high prices have had a significant impact. First of all, it has harmed the interests of the general consumers, making the milk supply situation in Beijing even tighter. After the cows of the milk farmers who withdrew from the cooperatives were bought, their original large number of milk subscribers could not be supplied. The supply order of various cooperative milk stations has also been disrupted. For example, the Red Star Collective Farm once completely stopped supplying all milk subscribers, and later changed to "no supply for adults, half supply for children." These milk-deficient subscribers have shifted to state-owned milk stations, increasing the pressure on state-owned milk stations. Secondly, this behavior has also seriously affected the socialist transformation of private milk farmers. Some milk farmers who have withdrawn from the cooperatives are unwilling to participate in joint state-private dairy factories after withdrawing from the cooperatives, emphasizing treatment and demanding independent operation. Some milk farmers who have not yet withdrawn from the cooperatives are also demanding independent operation.
    The milk cows of private milk farmers in Beijing are responsible for more than 50% of the city's milk supply. If this 50% force is not well organized, the market supply order will be chaotic, which may cause some units to have a surplus of milk, while the market is severely out of stock; some infants and patients who urgently need milk cannot buy milk, while some consumers who can temporarily not be supplied are fully satisfied. Therefore, in order to organize milk production in a planned way and gradually improve the milk supply situation in the market, in addition to the various state-owned farms and joint state-private dairy factories should improve their management and do a good job in supplying feed to increase milk production, it is hoped that the relevant departments in Beijing can immediately stop the phenomenon of state agencies and organizations buying milk cows, and quickly organize private milk farmers, and in the current situation of milk supply falling short of demand, to organize market supply in a planned way.
    The production volume of milk cannot fully meet consumer demand in a short period of time. Because the demand is growing very fast, while the production volume of milk is affected by many factors such as cow breeding and seasonal milk production. In this situation of supply falling short of demand, is it possible for milk supply stations to temporarily stop or reduce the milk supply to healthy adults? In order to ensure that infants and patients can get milk, I think these comrades will agree with this approach.

    北京市的牛奶供应问题
    刘柏枫
    近两个月来，北京市牛奶供应情况很紧张。北京市牛奶供应站和一些合作社的牛奶供应站，普遍都减少了对现有订户的牛奶供应，有的订户按原数量减少了一半，有的订户完全停止了供应。目前，这些奶站都不接收新的订户，就是一些迫切需要牛奶的病人，费尽心机也难买到一点牛奶。
    北京市牛奶供应情况紧张，主要的原因是由于广大的消费者对牛奶的需要量迅速上涨，而北京市牛奶的生产量却增长得很慢，赶不上日益增长的消费需要。以北京市国营东单奶站为例，今年十月份奶的销售量比去年同期增长了37％，而所辖各个国营农场的牛奶生产量只增长了9％。其次也由于奶牛产奶的季节性和有些奶厂经营不善等原因，减少了一部分生产量。
    但是，近两个月来，有不少国家机关、团体和企业以高价大量收买私营奶户的奶牛，也是促使牛奶供应紧张的一个原因。
    北京市的私营奶户，在社会主义改造高潮中，都加入了农业生产合作社。入社后，由于农户和奶户之间，在经营上和生活上存在一些困难，有少数奶户就退出了农业社自营。在这个时候，有些机关，团体和企业的福利部门为了本单位的人吃牛奶的方便，就趁机以高价和为奶户安排工作为条件收买这些退社奶户的奶牛。据现在已经知道的，就有水力发电总局收买了海甸区东方农业社七户退社户的八头奶牛，石景山钢铁厂收买了六头奶牛（还有许多机关尚未查清）。这样就影响市场每天减少了三千多磅牛奶的供应量。
    北京市有关部门曾劝阻过这些单位不要收买供应市场需要的奶牛。但是，这些单位并没有接受这种劝阻，到目前为止，在广安门外、东郊、海甸等地还是经常发现以高价收买奶牛的现象。广安门外的东北大院已经成为奶牛交易的黑市市场。
    这些单位以高价收买奶牛的行为所带来的影响是很大的。首先它损害了广大消费者的利益，促使北京市牛奶供应情况更加紧张。退社奶户的奶牛被买走后，他们原有的广大订奶户就得不到供应。各个合作社奶站的供应秩序也被打乱了。如红星集体农庄，对所有的订奶户曾经就一度完全停止供应，以后又改为“大人不供应，小孩供应一半”。这些缺奶的订户就向国营奶站转移，增加了对国营奶站的压力。其次这种行为也严重地影响了对私营奶户的社会主义改造。有些退了社的奶户，退社后不愿参加公私合营奶厂，强调待遇、要求自营。一些尚未退社的奶户，也要求自营。
    北京市私营奶户的奶牛，担负了全市50％以上的牛奶供应任务。如果这个50％的力量组织不好，市场供应秩序就会混乱，就有可能造成一些单位牛奶过剩，而市场严重脱销；一些迫切需要牛奶的婴儿和病人买不到牛奶，而一些暂时可以不供应的消费者却得到充分满足。所以，为了有计划地组织牛奶的生产，逐步改善市场上牛奶的供应情况，除了各个国营农场、公私合营奶厂应当改进经营管理，做好饲料供应工作以增加牛奶的生产量以外，希望北京市各有关部门能立即制止国家机关、团体收买奶牛的现象迅速将私营奶户组织起来，并在目前牛奶供不应求的情况下，以便有计划地组织市场供应。
    牛奶的生产量在一个短的时期之内是不可能充份满足消费需求的。因为需要量增长得很快，而牛奶的生产量却受到奶牛繁殖、产奶季节性等多方面的影响。在这种供不应求的情况下，牛奶供应站暂时停止或减少对健康的成人的牛奶供应是否可以呢？为了保证婴儿和病人吃到牛奶，我想，这些同志是会同意这种做法的。
