Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 29th. On the evening of November 28th, the working people of Moscow held a Soviet-Chinese People's Friendship Evening Party in the Hall of Columns of the Palace of Labor. The delegation of the National People's Congress of China and the delegation of the Beijing Municipal People's Committee, who had returned to Moscow from Tashkent that day, were invited to attend the party.

Present at the party were Brezhnev, Furtseva, and Belyayev, Secretaries of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union; Lobanov, Chairman of the Soviet of the Union of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR; Lacis, Chairman of the Soviet of Nationalities; Komarov, Deputy Chairman of the Soviet of Nationalities; Gorkin, Secretary of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR; Kuusinen, Chairman of the Soviet Parliamentary Group; Tikhonov, Chairman of the Soviet Peace Committee; Liu Xiao, Chinese Ambassador to the Soviet Union, and others.

The evening party was opened and presided over by Bobrovnikov, Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Moscow City Soviet. He delivered a welcome speech to the Chinese guests, saying that the visit of the delegation of the National People's Congress of China and the delegation of the Beijing Municipal People's Committee to us is a testament to the great fraternal friendship between our two peoples and the two capitals. We are very pleased to observe the creative labor of the talented and hard-working Chinese people. Every victory achieved by the Chinese people fills the hearts of the Soviet people with joy and pride. Today we are gathered here to once again express our sincere friendship and affection for the great Chinese people.

Bobrovnikov's words were greeted with warm applause from the audience.

Electric welder Rebshalov spoke at the meeting on behalf of the working people of Moscow and all the workers of the Likhachev Automobile Factory.

Peng Zhen, head of the delegation of the National People's Congress of China, spoke at the evening party. After introducing China's construction situation to the participants, he said: Our delegation's visit to the Soviet Union has deepened our mutual understanding and thus strengthened our friendship and solidarity. The Chinese people believe that the solid unity between China and the Soviet Union and the unity of socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union are important guarantees for lasting world peace, important guarantees for the cause of human progress to advance from victory to victory, and the greatest interests of the Chinese and Soviet peoples and the working people of the world. At the same time, the unity between our socialist countries also has a solid foundation. We have a common belief in Marxism-Leninism as the ideological foundation, a close-knit community of interests as the material foundation, and the leadership of the Communist Party and the firm support of the broad masses of people. These are the solid foundations of our friendly unity. Of course, this does not mean that there will never be any disputes between socialist countries. In fact, even in a harmonious family, disputes of one kind or another are sometimes unavoidable between siblings. However, among our socialist countries, even if disputes arise, they should and can be resolved through consultation. Recently, the talks between the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government and the Polish United Workers' Party and the Polish government, and the joint statement on Soviet-Polish relations, are an example. We Chinese people believe that this Soviet-Polish negotiation and statement will promote the friendly unity between the Soviet Union and Poland and enhance the unity between the communist parties, workers' parties, and socialist countries. Peng Zhen said that we should protect the unity between the Chinese and Soviet peoples like the apple of our eye, and protect the unity between the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union.

Peng Zhen's speech was repeatedly interrupted by applause.

Subsequently, the famous Soviet writer Tikhonov spoke. He said that the people of China and the Soviet Union are jointly building the edifice of friendship between the two peoples. The friendship between our two peoples is a manifestation of their loyalty to the cause of peace and to the great cause of socialism.

Li Jishen, Cheng Qian, Zhang Bojun, and Hu Ziang, all deputy heads of the National People's Congress delegation, also spoke successively. Their speeches were warmly welcomed.

Li Jishen said in his speech: The delegation is composed of representatives from the Communist Party of China, various democratic parties, people's organizations, and various aspects. This delegation is actually a microcosm of the united front led by the Communist Party of China. Such a widely representative delegation visiting your great country makes it possible for us to understand your country and people from various angles and aspects, and to learn from your valuable experiences from various fronts and positions.

Cheng Qian said in his speech that one of the most important tasks of our visit to the Soviet Union is to learn, and another important task is to strengthen the friendship and unity between the two peoples. Our visit will contribute to the development and consolidation of the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples.

After the meeting, a grand performance was held.

    莫斯科举行中苏两国人民友谊晚会
    彭真强调要像保护眼珠一样保护中苏友谊和社会主义国家的团结
    据新华社莫斯科29日电　11月28日晚间，莫斯科市劳动人民代表在工会大厦圆柱大厅举行了苏中两国人民友谊晚会。这一天从塔什干回到莫斯科的中国全国人民代表大会代表团和北京市人民委员会代表团应邀出席了晚会。
    苏联共产党中央委员会书记勃列日涅夫、福尔采娃、别利亚耶夫，苏联最高苏维埃联盟院主席洛巴诺夫、民族院主席拉齐斯、民族院副主席科马罗夫，苏联最高苏维埃主席团秘书戈尔金，苏联全国议员团主席库西宁，苏联保卫和平委员会主席吉洪诺夫，中国驻苏联大使刘晓等都出席了晚会。
    晚会由莫斯科市苏维埃执行委员会主席波布罗夫尼科夫主持开幕。他向中国客人致欢迎词说，中国全国人民代表大会代表团和北京市人民委员会代表团到我们这里来访问，是我们两国人民和两国首都之间的伟大的兄弟友谊的明证。我们非常高兴地注视着富有天才和热爱劳动的中国人民的创造性劳动。中国人民所获得的每一个胜利都使苏联人的心中充满高兴和骄傲。今天我们在这里集会，是为了再一次向伟大的中国人民表示我们真诚的友好和爱戴的感情。
    波布罗夫尼科夫的话博得了全场一片热烈掌声。
    电焊工人雷勃沙洛夫代表莫斯科劳动人民和利哈乔夫汽车工厂全体职工在会上讲了话。
    中国全国人民代表大会代表团团长彭真在晚会上讲了话。他在向与会者介绍了中国建设的情况以后说：我们代表团在苏联的访问，加深了我们相互间的了解，因而也加强了我们之间的友谊和团结。中国人民认为中苏两国的坚固的团结和以苏联为首的社会主义各国之间的团结，是世界持久和平的重要保障，是人类进步事业从胜利走向胜利的重要保证，是中苏两国人民和全世界劳动人民的最大利益。同时，我们社会主义各国之间的团结也是有着巩固的基础的，我们有着对马克思列宁主义的共同信仰作思想基础，有着休戚相关的利害关系作物质基础，有着共产党的领导和广大人民群众的坚决的支持。这些都是我们的友好团结的坚固基础。当然，这并不是说在社会主义各国之间永远不会发生任何的纷争。事实上，就是在一个和睦的大家庭中，在同胞兄弟姊妹之间，有时也难免发生这样那样的纷争的。但是，在我们社会主义各国之间，纵然发生了纷争，也是应该和完全可以协商解决的。最近，苏联共产党、苏联政府同波兰统一工人党、波兰政府的会谈和关于苏波关系的共同声明，就是一个例证。我们中国人民认为，这次苏波谈判和声明会促进苏波两国的友好团结，并且增进各国共产党、工人党之间和社会主义各国之间的团结。彭真说，我们应该像保护眼珠一样地来保护中、苏两国人民的团结，来保护以苏联为首的社会主义国家之间的团结。
    彭真的讲话一再被掌声打断。
    随后，苏联著名作家吉洪诺夫讲话。他说，中苏两国人民的手正在共同建筑着两国人民的友谊大厦。我们两国人民的友谊就是他们忠实于和平事业、忠实于社会主义伟大事业的表现。
    全国人民代表大会代表团副团长李济深、程潜、章伯钧和胡子昂都相继讲了话。他们的讲话都受到了热烈的欢迎。
    李济深在讲话中说：代表团是由中国共产党、各民主党派、各人民团体和各方面的代表人士组成的，这个代表团实际上就是一个由中国共产党领导的统一战线的缩影。这样一个代表性十分广泛的代表团来访问你们伟大的国家，有可能使我们从各个角度、各个侧面来了解你们的国家和人民，有可能使我们从各个战线、各个岗位来学习你们的宝贵经验。
    程潜讲话时说，我们访问苏联的一个极其重要的任务是学习，另一个重要任务是加强两国人民的友谊和团结。我们的访问有助于中苏两国人民友谊的发展和巩固。
    会后，举行了盛大的演出。
