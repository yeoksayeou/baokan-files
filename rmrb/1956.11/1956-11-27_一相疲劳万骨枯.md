The British Prime Minister's office announced on the 21st that Eden would fly to Jamaica on the 23rd for a three-week vacation to get the "necessary and sufficient rest." According to British officials, Eden had no physical ailments, but was merely "overtired."

Why was Eden "tired"? He launched a war of aggression and massacred innocent Egyptian peaceful residents, women and children. His nerves were bruised on the pyramids!

Eden's "fatigue" is not normal fatigue, but the fatigue of aggression; not the fatigue of cherishing peace, but the fatigue of launching a war; not the fatigue of benefiting mankind, but the fatigue of bringing disaster to the world; not the fatigue of justice, but the fatigue of crime; not the fatigue of glory, but the fatigue of shame!

His "fatigue" has caused so many people to shed blood and sacrifice their lives! It has made the peaceful residents of Egypt displaced and homeless! It has turned the poor British soldiers into ghosts in a foreign land!

His "fatigue" has created hundreds of thousands of orphans and widows!

His "fatigue" has caused the Suez Canal to be blocked. And his excuse for launching a war of aggression was to ensure the navigation of the Suez Canal. Look, Eden just slapped himself in the face! How loud that slap was! Everyone in the world heard it.

Eden has gone to get "necessary and sufficient rest"! He is resting alone! But hundreds of thousands of people are sleeping forever! He is resting overseas alone! But how many British soldiers are sleeping forever overseas! He can return home after he has rested enough. But the British soldiers who died in foreign lands for the unjust war of aggression will never be able to return home. He is resting, and God knows what kind of dreams he is having. But hundreds of thousands of kind and poor British widows and orphans can only dream of their husbands and fathers in their dreams!

He brought harm, disaster, and death to the Egyptian people! He brought the same harm, disaster, and death to the British people!

He took a plane to Jamaica to rest. The plane fuel he needed will not be reduced by a drop! But the British people are suffering from an oil shortage! Countless cars are threatened with being stopped, and countless factories are threatened with being shut down. The peaceful life of the vast people has been disrupted! The price of oil in Britain has risen. The price of bread has risen. The pockets of the British people are empty, but the pockets of the American capitalists—the oil bosses—are bulging. This is the happiness that Eden exchanged for the British people with blood and life!

Eden fell ill, "precisely at a difficult juncture for the government—when it was considering withdrawing troops from Egypt." If he had been more clear-headed when considering invading Egypt, he would not have been so overtired.

Let him be overtired, let him rest! A falling leaf heralds the coming of autumn!

Because, this is not just Eden's personal matter. The entire British imperialism is also overtired and should also "take a rest"!

    一相疲劳万骨枯
    高植
    英国首相官邸21日宣布，艾登要在23日乘飞机到牙买加去度三星期的假期，是为了得到“必需的和充分的休息”。据英国官方人士说，艾登并没有肌体上的病症，而只是“过度疲劳”。
    艾登为什么“疲劳”呢？发动了侵略战争，屠杀了无辜的埃及和平居民、妇女和儿童，他的神经在金字塔上碰伤了！
    艾登的“疲劳”不是正常的疲劳，而是侵略的疲劳；不是珍惜和平的疲劳，而是发动战争的疲劳；不是造福人类的疲劳，而是祸殃世界的疲劳；不是正义的疲劳，而是犯罪的疲劳；不是光荣的疲劳，而是可耻的疲劳！
    他的“疲劳”使得多少人流出了鲜血，牺牲了生命！使埃及的和平居民流离失所，无家可归！使可怜的英国士兵成了异域之鬼！
    他的“疲劳”，制造了成千上万的孤儿寡妇！
    他的“疲劳”，造成了苏伊士运河的阻塞。而他发动侵略战争的借口，是为保障苏伊士运河的通航。瞧，艾登正好打了他自己一个耳光！这个耳光打得多么响！全世界的人都听见了。
    艾登获得“必需的和充分的休息”去了！他一个人休息去了！但是成千上万的人长眠了！他一个人到海外休息去了！可是多少英国士兵在海外长眠了！他休息够了还可以回国。但是为了不义的侵略战争而死在异域的英国士兵永远不得回国了。他休息了，上帝知道他在做什么样的梦。但是成千上万的善良的可怜的英国寡妇和孤儿，只能在梦里梦见他们的丈夫和爸爸了！
    他给埃及人民带来的是祸害，是灾难，是死亡！他给英国人民带来的同样是祸害，是灾难，是死亡！
    他坐飞机到牙买加休息去了。他所需用的飞机汽油不会减少一滴！但是英国广大人民在闹石油荒了！无数的汽车受到停驶的威胁，无数的工厂受到停车的威胁。广大人民的和平生活被扰乱了！英国的石油涨价了。面包涨价了。英国人民的口袋瘪了，美国资本家——石油老板——的口袋却臌起来了。这就是艾登用鲜血和生命换给英国人民的幸福！
    艾登害了病，“恰恰在政府的困难关头——要考虑从埃及撤兵的时候害了病。”而他在考虑侵略埃及的时候，要是头脑清醒一点，就不会疲劳过度了。
    让他过度疲劳吧，让他休息吧！这是一叶知秋！
    因为，这决不只是艾登个人的事。整个英帝国主义也过度疲劳了，也该“休息休息”了！
