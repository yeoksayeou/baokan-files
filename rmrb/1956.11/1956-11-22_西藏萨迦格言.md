    Tibetan Sakya Proverbs
    When wicked people gain knowledge and wealth,
    They become even more detestable and frightening;
    No matter how you lead the waterfall upwards,
    It always rushes downwards.
    Isn't it the glory of a leader
    To make those around him happy and joyful?!
    Isn't it the glory of the master
    To make the saddle and bridle on the horse bright and dazzling?!
    The wicked are like a tea filter,
    Grasping the waste and discarding the essence;
    Using all their strength to retain their own shortcomings,
    Yet unable to retain even a little bit of useful knowledge.
    In the place where the most learned people live,
    Who still knows that there are other learned people?!
    When the sun rises into the sky,
    Who can still see the stars shining?!

    西藏萨迦格言
    恶人获得了知识和财富，
    会变得更加可恶又可怕；
    不管你怎么把瀑布向上引，
    它总是一个劲儿往下流泻。
    使周围的人幸福而愉快，
    难道不是做领导人的光彩？！
    使马身上鞍鞯光鲜耀目，
    难道不是主人的光彩？！
    恶人就像茶滤子，
    抓住了废物扔掉了精华；
    用全力来保留自己的缺点，
    却保不住一点点有用的学问。
    在最博学的人住的地方，
    谁还知道还有别的有学问的人？！
    当太阳升上天的时候，
    谁还能看见星星在放光？！
    王尧选译
