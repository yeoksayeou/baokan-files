Correcting This Side, Leaning to That Side
Jian Yun

For the past two or three years, many places have one-sidedly emphasized grain production, converting some land originally suitable for growing cash crops to rice and other grain crops, thus hindering the increase in cash crop production and affecting farmers' incomes.

Recently, various localities have been paying attention to correcting this deviation. However, in the process of correcting this bias, a small number of agricultural cooperatives have leaned to the other side: blindly planning to expand the planting area of ​​cash crops. Cadres of the Lingshan Agricultural Production Cooperative in Panyu County, Guangdong Province, believe that "cash crop income is higher than rice," so they plan to convert 1,000 mu of land to cash crops next year. The Foshan Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party found during an inspection that some places even assigned the task of conversion from top to bottom. The Zhongshan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party reflected that a township's cadres requested that the entire township convert more than 300 mu of land to cash crops next year, but after discussion by the members, they believed that only more than 100 mu could be converted.

Some cadres have the one-sided idea of blindly expanding the area of ​​cash crops mainly because they simply compare the price of rice crops produced per unit area with the price of cash crops, and they believe that converting to cash crops can increase income. This separates from various necessary and possible conditions, and isolates the determination of the planting area of ​​various crops. When formulating planting plans, if we do not first consider how to ensure the completion of the state's grain requisition and purchase tasks, and ensure the needs of the community's food and feed, serious consequences will occur. The resolution on the political report of the Eighth National Congress of the Party clearly pointed out: "Grain production is the foundation of the agricultural economy and must be developed with priority; at the same time, the production of cotton and other cash crops must also be developed in appropriate proportions, and the development of animal husbandry and sideline production, and the development of various agricultural economies." This is the policy we must follow.

Cash crops should be developed appropriately, but when formulating plans to expand cash crops, we should also consider that converting to cash crops requires more labor, fertilizer, and funds, and requires considerable experience. If these problems that must be solved cannot be resolved, increased production is not guaranteed.

Blindly planning to expand the area of ​​cash crop conversion is another manifestation of one-sidedness in agricultural production. This bias should be prevented and corrected in a timely manner.

    纠了这边，偏到那边
    健云
    两三年来，不少地方片面强调了粮食生产，把有些原来适于种植经济作物的土地，改种了水稻等粮食作物，因而妨碍了经济作物的增产，影响了农民的收入。
    最近时期，各地都在注意纠正这个偏差。但是，在纠正这个偏向的过程中，有少数农业社又偏到另一边去了：盲目地计划扩大经济作物种植面积。广东番禺县灵山农业生产合作社的干部认为“经济作物收入比稻谷多”，于是，计划明年一下子改种经济作物一千亩。中共佛山地委在检查中发现：有些地方甚至把改种任务由上往下摊派。中共中山县委反映：有一个乡的干部，要求全乡明年改种经济作物三百多亩，经过社员讨论，认为只能改种一百多亩。
    有些干部所以产生盲目扩大经济作物面积的片面思想，主要是由于单纯把单位面积上生产的稻谷作物的价格跟经济作物的价格比较，他们认为改种经济作物可以增加收入。这样就脱离开各种需要和可能的条件，孤立地决定各种作物的种植面积。在规定种植计划的时候，如果不首先考虑到如何保证完成国家征粮购粮任务，保证社内口粮和饲料的需要，那将会发生严重的后果。党的第八次全国代表大会关于政治报告的决议上，明确地指出：“粮食生产是农业经济的基础，必须优先发展；同时也必须按照适当的比例发展棉花和其他各种经济作物的生产，并且发展畜牧业和副业生产，发展农业的各种经济。”这是我们必须遵循的方针。
    经济作物应该适当发展，但是在制定扩种经济作物计划的时候也应该考虑到：改种经济作物，需要更多的劳动力、肥料和资金，需要有相当的经验。如果这些必须解决的问题不能得到解决，增产是没有保证的。
    盲目地计划扩大改种经济作物的面积，是农业生产上的片面性的另一种表现。这种偏向应当及时防止和纠正。
