Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, November 24th. Construction officially began on the North Mine of the Zhongliangshan Coal Mine in Chongqing on the 23rd. This is the second large-scale mine being built to develop the Zhongliangshan coalfield.

Geological exploration of the northern coalfield of Zhongliang Mountain concluded at the end of last year, and the preliminary design of the mine was completed in the first half of this year. The main construction projects of this mine include excavating more than ten *li* of roadways and a pair of large vertical shafts over one *li* long.

The North and South mines of Zhongliang Mountain are both the largest modern mines in the Southwest at present. Once fully completed and put into production, the annual coal production will be equivalent to 87% of the planned output of nine coal mines in Sichuan Province, including Nantong, Tianfu, and Donglin, this year. Construction of the South Mine project began in September of last year. Currently, the construction of the adit, vertical shaft, high-voltage substation, employee housing, and the mine's dedicated railway line is in full swing.

    中梁山第二个大型矿井开始建设
    新华社重庆24日电　重庆中梁山煤矿北矿井23日正式开工建设。这是为开发中梁山煤田而建设的第二个大型矿井。
    中梁山北部煤田在去年年底结束地质勘探工作，今年上半年完成了矿井的初步设计。建设这个矿井的主要工程包括开凿十里以上的巷道和一里多长的一对大型竖井井筒。
    中梁山南北两矿井都是目前西南最大的现代化矿井。它全部建成投入生产以后，每年生产的煤相当于四川省南桐、天府、东林等九个煤矿今年计划产量的87％。南矿井工程已经在去年9月开工。现在这个矿井的平硐、竖井、高压变电站、职工住宅以及矿区铁路专用线等工程的施工已经全面展开。
