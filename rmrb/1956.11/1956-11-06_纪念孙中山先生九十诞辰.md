Commemorating the Ninetieth Anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's Birth
Zhou Shidi

November 12th of this year marks the ninetieth anniversary of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's birth. We commemorate this great revolutionary with the utmost respect and heartfelt affection.

During the Opium War, imperialist forces invaded China. In 1894, Japanese imperialism occupied Taiwan and the Penghu Islands. In order to oppose the Qing government and revitalize China, Mr. Sun Yat-sen organized the Revive China Society (Xingzhonghui) and launched an uprising in Guangdong in 1895, which later failed. In 1905, he organized the Chinese United League (Tongmenghui) to carry out a revolutionary struggle to overthrow the Qing Dynasty. To this end, Mr. Sun Yat-sen traveled extensively at home and abroad, promoting revolution, recruiting comrades, and organizing uprisings. He encountered many twists and turns and failures, but finally, the Xinhai Revolution, which broke out on October 10, 1911, overthrew the Qing Dynasty and ended the feudal imperial system that had lasted for more than two thousand years. Later, Yuan Shikai, leading the reactionary forces, usurped state power, and the revolution failed again. After that, Mr. Sun Yat-sen continued the struggle to讨伐 Yuan Shikai and oppose the Northern Warlord government, but he did not succeed. In July 1922, during the campaign to suppress Chen Jiongming's rebellion, Mr. Sun Yat-sen personally led the Yongfeng and four other warships from Huangpu to Guangzhou to support the Shaoguan battle. At that time, the British imperialist Consul-General stationed in Shamian, Guangzhou, threatened Mr. Sun Yat-sen in the capacity of representatives of various imperialist powers, forbidding him from leading his warships into the river near Guangzhou. Mr. Sun Yat-sen ignored the imperialist threats and sailed his warships to the vicinities of the consulates of the various imperialist powers, the leased territories of the various imperialist powers, and the White Swan Pool near Shamian, the base where the various imperialist powers oppressed and plundered the Chinese people, and insisted on the struggle. In 1924, the reactionary armed organization of the comprador bourgeoisie supported by imperialism—the Guangdong Merchant Corps—colluded with the warlords to launch a rebellion, attempting to overthrow the Guangzhou Revolutionary Government. They occupied part of Guangzhou's urban area, posted notices demanding that Sun Yat-sen step down, and British imperialism also threatened Sun Yat-sen. At that time, the Communists vigorously supported Mr. Sun Yat-sen's suppression of the Merchant Corps, while the right wing of the Kuomintang expressed wavering and opposition. The situation was very urgent and complex. Mr. Sun Yat-sen resolutely decided to firmly suppress the Merchant Corps. With the support of the masses, he disarmed the Merchant Corps in October and completely quelled the rebellion. In the winter of 1924, Mr. Sun Yat-sen left Guangzhou for the north to seek the convocation of a national assembly and the abolition of the unequal treaties imposed on the Chinese people by imperialism. On March 12, 1925, Mr. Sun Yat-sen died of illness in Beijing. On his deathbed, he still never forgot to awaken the masses, unite with the nations of the world that treat us equally to fight together, cooperate with the Soviet Union, abolish unequal treaties, and oppose imperialism to liberate the Chinese people. Throughout his life, Mr. Sun Yat-sen struggled to overthrow the rule and oppression of the Chinese people by imperialism, colonialism, and domestic reactionary governments, and to establish an independent, free, prosperous, and strong China. He suffered many failures, but he was not discouraged. He carried out constant struggles with the spirit of perseverance and continuous efforts. This represented the firm will of the Chinese people to oppose imperialism, oppose colonialism, and oppose domestic reactionary rule in order to seek liberation.

The success of the great October Socialist Revolution awakened the oppressed people of the world. The Chinese people saw the immense brilliance of socialism and found the correct path to liberate China. As a result, the great anti-imperialist and anti-feudal "May Fourth" revolutionary movement took place in 1919, and the political party of the Chinese proletariat—the Communist Party of China—was born in 1921. Mr. Sun Yat-sen said: "Because of the Russian Revolution, mankind has a great hope." Therefore, he began to correspond with the great Lenin as early as 1918. From his many years of struggle experience, he realized that the Chinese revolution would not succeed without learning from Russia; he realized that the Communist Party of China was the political party of the proletariat and the most revolutionary and vigorous new force supported by the broad masses of the people. At this time, Mr. Sun Yat-sen's political thought and revolutionary direction underwent new developments. He realized that the Kuomintang he led could no longer realize his revolutionary aspirations, so he advocated reorganizing the Kuomintang and cooperating with the Communist Party. This proposal was opposed by some people within the Kuomintang. However, Mr. Sun Yat-sen, disregarding these objections, resolutely reorganized the Kuomintang, cooperated with the Communist Party, formulated the three major revolutionary policies of "alliance with Russia, alliance with the Communist Party, and assistance to peasants and workers," and reinterpreted the Three Principles of the People, transforming the old Three Principles of the People into the New Three Principles of the People. From his past experiences, he realized that the old army was unreliable and could not realize his revolutionary aspirations, and that a new army must be organized, so he founded the Whampoa Military Academy. Mr. Sun Yat-sen believed that the Communists were his closest friends and the most reliable revolutionaries. Many Communists held responsible positions at the Whampoa Military Academy, and many students were also Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members, forming a revolutionary backbone in the school. He also transferred Xu Chengzhang, a Whampoa Military Academy instructor and Communist Party member, to be the captain of his Grand Marshal's armored vehicle team. Mr. Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary propositions and revolutionary measures expressed the deep aspirations of the Chinese people. Chairman Mao said: "Mr. Sun Yat-sen is great not only because he led the great Xinhai Revolution (although it was a democratic revolution of the old period), but also because he was able to 'adapt to the trend of the world and meet the needs of the people,' put forward the three major revolutionary policies of alliance with Russia, alliance with the Communist Party, and assistance to peasants and workers, and made a new interpretation of the Three Principles of the People, establishing the New Three Principles of the People based on the three major policies." ("On New Democracy")

After Mr. Sun Yat-sen's death, Chiang Kai-shek, the representative of the big bourgeoisie hidden within the revolutionary camp, created the counter-revolutionary "Zhongshan Warship Incident" on March 20, 1926, and arrested many Communists. In 1927, Chiang Kai-shek colluded with imperialism to openly betray the revolution, launched the anti-communist and anti-people "April 12th" coup, and massacred Communists and revolutionary masses on a large scale. In July of the same year, Wang Jingwei launched the "July 15th" counter-revolutionary coup and again massacred Communists and revolutionary masses on a large scale. Chiang and Wang colluded and committed evil together, completely betraying Mr. Sun Yat-sen and his revolutionary policies, causing the vigorous Great Revolution to fail. However, the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people were not intimidated, conquered, or exterminated; their awareness was further enhanced, their experience was richer, and their fighting spirit was stronger. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese people continued to fight against powerful enemies at home and abroad. They advanced wave upon wave, unyielding, brave and tenacious, and fought arduously, overcoming unprecedented difficulties, and finally overthrew the rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism in 1949, established the People's Republic of China, thoroughly completed the bourgeois democratic revolution, and began the socialist revolution. Six hundred million people across the country are accelerating and strengthening socialist construction with selfless labor enthusiasm, and have now achieved decisive victories. The Chinese people have gained true democracy, freedom, and equality, and their economic and cultural lives have been continuously improved. The people of the whole country have united as never before, the strength of the Chinese people has become unprecedentedly powerful, and the international status of the People's Republic of China has been unprecedentedly enhanced. These great achievements of the Chinese people are inseparable from Mr. Sun Yat-sen's lifelong struggle.

Currently, American imperialism is still occupying our Taiwan, hindering us from completing the sacred task of liberating Taiwan and unifying the motherland. We must liberate Taiwan, and we believe that we will surely be able to liberate Taiwan. Because the occupation of our Taiwan by American imperialism is a despicable and shameful act of aggression, opposed by peace-loving people all over the world. Our liberation of Taiwan is the unshakable will of the people of the whole country and a just struggle. Any imperialist conspiracy to obstruct and undermine our liberation of Taiwan is doomed to failure. Our historical task of liberating Taiwan and unifying the motherland will be accomplished and must be accomplished. Our struggle to liberate Taiwan will be victorious and must be victorious. On the occasion of commemorating the ninetieth anniversary of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's birth, we must work together, bravely, resolutely, and unyieldingly, to fight for the liberation of Taiwan.

    纪念孙中山先生九十诞辰
    周士第
    今年11月12日，是孙中山先生诞生九十周年纪念日，我们怀着崇高的敬意、亲切的心情来纪念这一位伟大的革命家。
    鸦片战争的时候，帝国主义势力侵入中国，1894年日本帝国主义侵占了我国的台湾和澎湖列岛。孙中山先生为了反对清廷、复兴中国，组织了兴中会，1895年在广东发动起义，后来失败了。1905年他组织了中国同盟会，进行推翻清朝统治的革命斗争。为此目的，孙中山先生在国内外各地奔走，宣传革命，征集同志，并组织起义，遭到过许多波折和失败，终于在1911年10月10日爆发的辛亥革命推翻了清朝的统治，结束了两千多年来的封建帝王制度。后来，袁世凯领导的反动派篡夺了国家权力，革命又失败了。此后，孙中山先生又继续进行讨伐袁世凯、反对北洋军阀政府的斗争，但是没有得到成功。1922年7月间讨伐陈炯明叛乱时，为了支援韶关战斗，孙中山先生亲率永丰号等五艘军舰，由黄埔向广州前进。当时驻在广州沙面的英帝国主义的总领事，以各帝国主义代表的身分威胁孙中山先生，不准他率领的军舰驶进广州市附近的江面。孙中山先生不顾帝国主义的威胁，将军舰开到各帝国主义的领事馆所在地，各帝国主义的租借地，各帝国主义压迫掠夺中国人民的基地沙面附近的白鹅潭坚持斗争。1924年帝国主义支持的买办资产阶级的反动武装组织——广东商团，同军阀勾结发动叛乱，企图推翻广州革命政府。他们占领了广州一部分市区，张贴布告要孙中山下野，英帝国主义也对孙中山进行威胁。当时，共产党人极力赞助孙中山先生讨伐商团，而国民党右派则表示动摇和反对。情况很为紧急、复杂，孙中山先生毅然决定坚决讨伐商团。他在群众的支持下，10月间解除了商团的武装，完全平定了商团的叛乱。1924年冬，孙中山先生为了谋求召开国民会议，废除帝国主义压在中国人民头上的不平等条约，离开广州北上。1925年3月12日，先生病逝于北京。临终之时，他还念念不忘要唤起民众，联合世界上以平等待我之民族共同奋斗，与苏联通力合作，废除不平等条约，反对帝国主义以求中国人民之解放。孙中山先生毕生为了推翻帝国主义、殖民主义和国内反动政府对中国人民的统治和压迫，建立一个独立、自由、繁荣、富强的中国，遭到过好多次失败，但是他没有灰心，以百折不挠、再接再厉的精神进行了不断的斗争。这是代表了中国人民反对帝国主义、反对殖民主义、反对国内反动统治以求解放的坚强意志的。
    伟大十月社会主义革命的成功，唤醒了世界上被压迫的人民。中国人民看到了社会主义的万丈光芒，找到了解放中国的正确道路，因而1919年发生了伟大的反帝反封建的“五四”革命运动，1921年诞生了中国无产阶级的政党——中国共产党。孙中山先生说：“因为有了俄国革命，世界人类便生出了一个大希望。”所以他从1918年就开始同伟大的列宁来往。他从多年奋斗的经验中，认识到中国革命非以俄为师断无成就；认识到中国共产党是无产阶级的政党，是为广大人民所拥护的最革命的生气勃勃的新生力量。这时，孙中山先生的政治思想和革命方向有了新的发展。他认识到他所领导的国民党已经不能实现他的革命主张，所以他主张改组国民党，同共产党合作。这个主张，遭到了国民党内部一部分人的反对。但是，孙中山先生不顾这些反对，坚决的改组了国民党，同共产党合作，制定了“联俄、联共、扶助农工”三大革命政策，重新解释了三民主义，把旧三民主义变为新三民主义。他从历次经验中，认识到旧军队是靠不住的，是不能实现他的革命主张的，必须组织新的军队，所以创办了黄埔军官学校。孙中山先生认为共产党人是他最亲信的朋友，是最可靠的革命者。在黄埔军校里，有许多共产党员担任着负责的工作，很多学生也是共产党员和共产主义青年团员，他们在学校里形成了革命的骨干。他又调黄埔军校教官、共产党员徐成章作他的大元帅府铁甲车队的队长。孙中山先生的革命主张、革命措施，是表现了中国人民的深切愿望的。毛主席说：“孙中山先生之所以伟大，不但因为他领导了伟大的辛亥革命（虽然是旧时期的民主革命），而且因为他能够‘适乎世界之潮流，合乎人群之需要’，提出了联俄、联共、扶助农工三大革命政策，对三民主义作了新的解释，树立了三大政策的新三民主义。”（“新民主主义论”）
    孙中山先生逝世之后，隐藏在革命阵营内部的大资产阶级代表蒋介石，在1926年3月20日制造了反革命的“中山舰事件”，逮捕了许多共产党员。1927年蒋介石同帝国主义勾结公开叛变革命，发动了反共反人民的“四一二”政变，大肆屠杀共产党员和革命群众。同年7月，汪精卫发动了“七一五”反革命政变，又大肆屠杀共产党员和革命群众。蒋、汪合流，共同作恶，完全背叛了孙中山先生和他的革命政策，使轰轰烈烈的大革命遭到了失败。但是，中国共产党和中国人民并没有被吓倒，被征服，被杀绝；他们的觉悟更加提高了，经验更加丰富了，斗志更加坚强了。中国人民在中国共产党的领导下，同国内外的强大敌人继续战斗，他们前仆后继，百折不回、英勇顽强、艰苦奋斗，克服了史无前例的重重困难，终于在1949年推翻了帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义的统治，建立了中华人民共和国，彻底地完成了资产阶级民主革命，开始了社会主义革命，全国六亿人民以忘我的劳动热情加速和加强着社会主义建设，现在已经取得了决定性的胜利。中国人民已经得到了真正的民主、自由、平等，经济文化生活得到了不断的提高，全国人民已经空前的团结起来，中国人民的力量已经空前的强大，中华人民共和国的国际地位已经得到空前的提高。中国人民的这些伟大成就，是和孙中山先生毕生的奋斗分不开的。
    现在，美帝国主义还在霸占着我们的台湾，阻挠我们完成解放台湾统一祖国的神圣任务。我们一定要解放台湾，并且相信一定能够解放台湾。因为美帝国主义霸占我们的台湾，是卑鄙、可耻的侵略行为，是全世界爱好和平人民所反对的。我们解放台湾，是全国人民不可动摇的意志，是正义的斗争。任何帝国主义阻挠、破坏我们解放台湾的阴谋，都是要失败的，注定要失败。我们解放台湾统一祖国的历史任务是要完成的，一定能够完成。我们解放台湾的斗争是要胜利的，一定能够胜利。在纪念孙中山先生诞辰九十周年的时候，我们要一致努力，勇敢地、坚决地、百折不回地为解放台湾而奋斗。
