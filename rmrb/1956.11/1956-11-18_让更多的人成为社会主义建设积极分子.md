Let More People Become Active Participants in Socialist Construction
The National Congress of Active Participants in Socialist Construction of Revolutionary Martyrs' Families, Military Dependents, Disabled Veterans, and Demobilized Soldiers has concluded victoriously.

Revolutionary Martyrs' Families, Military Dependents, Disabled Veterans, and Demobilized Soldiers have been nurtured and educated by the Party for a long time and have always been a most reliable, active, and vibrant political force. During the period of the bourgeois democratic revolution, they themselves stepped onto the front lines of the revolution or sent their loved ones there, and actively participated in social reform movements and productive labor. They made great sacrifices in the various revolutionary wars; in the socialist revolution and socialist construction, they contributed their greatest strength. Xue Dainiang, a revolutionary martyr's family member from Anhui Province who participated in this conference, lost her husband and two sons for the revolutionary cause. She herself has been an activist in various jobs and is now the deputy director of an agricultural production cooperative. Comrade Li Laicai, a disabled veteran from Henan Province who lost both feet, was a model Party member and model squad leader in a certain brigade during the Liberation War, and was awarded the title of first-class meritorious person in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea. Now he is a famous "footless tractor driver." Their selfless labor spirit in production and work is a glorious manifestation of dedicating their entire body and mind to the revolutionary cause.

The Party and the government have always been very concerned about revolutionary martyrs' families, military dependents, disabled veterans, and demobilized soldiers. On the one hand, they are given appropriate arrangements and care in production or work, and are regularly given socialist education; on the other hand, they are vigorously helped to solve difficulties in production and life. In the seven years from 1950 to 1956 alone, the state spent nearly 1 billion yuan in this regard. The masses also regularly care about their daily lives. For a long time, the masses cultivated land on behalf of poor revolutionary martyrs' families, military dependents, and disabled veterans. Now agricultural cooperatives give these households preferential treatment in terms of workdays. It is obvious that it is unimaginable for anyone to achieve great success without the support of the state and the masses. Revolutionary martyrs' families, military dependents, disabled veterans, and demobilized soldiers should correctly understand the source of their achievements, further rely on the leadership of the Party and the government, humbly learn from the masses, guard against arrogance and impetuosity, make persistent efforts, and continue to move forward. Activist comrades should conscientiously implement the spirit of this meeting in their own practical actions, unite all revolutionary martyrs' families, military dependents, disabled veterans, and demobilized soldiers, unite the surrounding masses, and make greater contributions to the cause of socialist construction. In order for revolutionary martyrs' families, military dependents, disabled veterans, and demobilized soldiers to make greater achievements in the future, it is also necessary to mobilize all forces to give them more support.

Some staff members, seeing that many revolutionary martyrs' families, military dependents, disabled veterans, and demobilized soldiers are women, elderly, or disabled, believe that they can no longer contribute to society, and even feel that they are "troublesome," so they do not pay attention to helping them. These staff members do not understand that the socialist consciousness of the masses is the decisive factor in socialist construction. Facts have proven that many revolutionary martyrs' families, military dependents, disabled veterans, and demobilized soldiers, although old, are not old in spirit. Some of them are physically disabled, but their minds are not. As long as they are given appropriate conditions, they can become active participants in socialist construction and play a significant role. At the same time, it should also be seen that in the upsurge of socialist construction, every citizen, especially those with higher consciousness, will not only not be happy to sit back and enjoy preferential treatment, but will feel depressed. Only when they feel that the great achievements of socialist construction contain their own labor will they feel truly happy in life.

In the work of resettling demobilized soldiers, there are currently some serious shortcomings and errors that must be corrected. For example, after Comrade Guo Shangde, a demobilized soldier from the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, joined the Pingdiquan Food Company's breeding farm, he saw the chaotic work in the factory and proposed suggestions for improving the work, but Kan Bailin, the responsible cadre of the factory, believed that his actions lowered the prestige of the leadership, so he sought opportunities to attack him and forcibly ordered him to resign. Demobilized soldiers return from the army with full enthusiasm to make contributions to socialist construction, but some of them are not met with welcome, but with attacks. Some staff members get a "headache" at the mention of demobilized soldiers, saying that they are "difficult to deal with," without checking the resettlement work for demobilized soldiers. This shows that some of our comrades still underestimate the positive role of demobilized soldiers in socialist construction. We hope that all localities will quickly take measures to overcome the shortcomings in the resettlement work, conscientiously implement the State Council's resolutions, and make preparations to welcome the upcoming demobilization and resettlement work in 1957.

Of course, it should also be admitted that some revolutionary martyrs' families, military dependents, disabled veterans, and demobilized soldiers are not performing well enough. Some demand unreasonable special care from the state and the masses, some demobilized soldiers are suitable for resettlement in rural areas but are unwilling to go to rural areas, and some even violate laws and discipline, which will of course lose the people's respect for them and lose their existing honor. We hope that those who have these shortcomings or errors will quickly correct them, catch up, and learn from activists. However, it must be pointed out that those who have these shortcomings and errors are only individual cases, and any exaggeration of their shortcomings and errors is not allowed. Moreover, our education work should be checked. We have a responsibility to educate them not to make shortcomings and errors, or to be able to quickly correct them after they occur, and then become activists.

It should also be mentioned that in recent years, the social atmosphere of supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to military families has not been as active as in the past. Some agricultural production cooperatives give very few preferential workdays to poor revolutionary martyrs' families, military dependents, and disabled veterans, and cannot guarantee that their lives reach the living standards of ordinary commune members, or they have not arranged for them to participate in productive activities within their capabilities. Some of the masses are also not as close and respectful to revolutionary martyrs' families, military dependents, disabled veterans, demobilized soldiers, and active servicemen as they used to be. This situation is certainly not good. But the masses should not be blamed, but certain local leading staff should be blamed. The long-term environment of peaceful construction has made these leaders relax their leadership over this work. This situation should be changed. No matter when, it is a glorious responsibility and obligation of the state and the people to give preferential treatment and care to those who have contributed to the revolutionary cause. All localities should further do this work well, care more about the production and lives of revolutionary martyrs' families, military dependents, disabled veterans, and demobilized soldiers, create possible conditions to give greater play to their enthusiasm, and enable more people to become activists and role models, in order to promote China's socialist cause.

### 让更多的人成为社会主义建设积极分子

    让更多的人成为社会主义建设积极分子
    全国烈属、军属、残废军人、复员军人社会主义建设积极分子大会胜利闭幕了。
    烈属、军属、残废军人和复员军人受过党的长期的培养和教育，一向是一支最可靠、最积极、最活跃的政治力量。他们在资产阶级民主革命时期，一方面自己走上或是把自己的亲人送上革命的最前线，一方面积极参加了社会改革运动和生产劳动。在历次革命战争中，他们付出了巨大的牺牲；在社会主义革命和社会主义建设中，他们又贡献了自己最大的力量。参加这次大会的安徽省烈属薛大娘，她的丈夫和两个儿子都为革命事业牺牲了，她自己在各种工作中都是积极分子，现在担任着一个农业生产合作社的副主任。河南省失去双脚的残废军人李来财同志，在解放战争时期是某旅的模范党员、模范班的班长，在抗美援朝战争中荣获一等功臣称号，现在是一位有名的“无脚拖拉机手”。他们在生产和工作中的忘我劳动精神，是把全部身心献给革命事业的光辉表现。
    党和政府对烈属、军属、残废军人和复员军人一向都非常关怀。一方面在生产或工作上给他们以适当安排和照顾，并经常对他们进行社会主义教育；另一方面又大力帮助他们解决生产和生活上的困难。只是1950年到1956年七年内，国家在这方面就支出了近十亿元的经费。群众对他们的日常生活也经常关心。长时期以来，群众为贫苦的烈属、军属、残废军人代耕土地，现在农业合作社又对这些户给予劳动日优待。很明显，任何人如果离开国家和群众的支持而要作出很大成绩，那是不可想像的。烈属、军属、残废军人和复员军人们应该正确认识自己成绩的来源，进一步依靠党和政府的领导，虚心向群众学习，戒骄戒躁，再接再厉，继续前进。积极分子同志们应该把这次会议的精神很好地贯彻到自己的实际行动中去，团结全体烈属、军属、残废军人和复员军人，团结周围的群众，在社会主义建设事业中作出更大的贡献。而要使烈属、军属、残废军人、复员军人在今后作出更大的成绩，还必须动员各方面的力量，给他们以更多的支持。
    有一部分工作人员看到烈属、军属、残废军人、复员军人中有许多是妇女，是老人，是残废，就认为他们不能再对社会作出贡献，甚至感到是“麻烦”，因而不注意帮助他们。这些工作人员不懂得群众的社会主义觉悟是社会主义建设的决定性因素。事实都证明，许多烈属、军属、残废军人、复员军人虽然年老了，精神并没有老，他们有的肢体残废了而思想并没有残废，只要给他们适当的条件，他们就能够成为社会主义建设的积极分子，发挥重大的作用。同时，也应该看到，在社会主义建设高潮中，每一个公民，特别是具有较高觉悟的公民，对坐享优待不仅不会高兴，反倒是会感到苦闷的。只有在他们感觉到社会主义建设的伟大成就中包含着自己的一份劳动的时候，他们才会感到生活的真正愉快。
    在安置复员军人的工作中，目前有一些严重的缺点和错误，必须加以纠正。例如内蒙古自治区复员军人郭尚德同志参加平地泉食品公司饲养厂工作以后，看到厂内工作混乱，便提出改进工作的建议，但该厂的负责干部阚柏林却认为他这样做是降低了领导威信，因而寻隙打击，强令他退职。复员军人从部队复员回来，满腔热情地要在社会主义建设中立功，可是他们中间有些人遇到的却不是欢迎，而是打击。还有些工作人员一提起复员军人就“头疼”，说他们“难缠”，而不去检查对复员军人的安置工作。这就说明，我们有些同志对于复员军人在社会主义建设中的积极作用还估计不足。我们希望各地迅速采取措施，克服安置工作中的缺点，认真贯彻国务院的决议，并且作好准备，迎接即将到来的1957年的复员安置工作。
    当然，也应该承认，有的烈属、军属、残废军人和复员军人表现是不够好的。有的向国家和群众要求不合理的特殊照顾，有的复员军人适合在农村安置却不愿到农村去，也有的居然违法乱纪，这样当然会丧失人民对他的尊敬，丧失已有的荣誉。我们希望有这些缺点或错误的人迅速改正，迎头赶上，向积极分子看齐。但是，必须指出，有这种缺点和错误的人只是个别的，任何夸大他们的缺点和错误的行为，都是不能容许的。而且应该检查我们的教育工作，我们有责任教育他们不发生缺点和错误，或者在发生以后能够迅速改正，并进而成为积极分子。
    还应该提到的是，近几年来，社会上的拥军优属的风气不如过去活跃了。有些农业生产合作社对贫苦烈属、军属、残废军人优待的劳动日很少，不能保证他们的生活达到一般社员的生活水平，或者没有给他们安排力所能及的生产活动。一部分群众在同烈属、军属、残废军人、复员军人以及现役军人相处的时候，也不像过去对他们那样的亲密和尊敬。这种情况当然是不好的。但是不应责备群众，而应责备某些地方领导工作人员。长时期的和平建设环境，使这些领导人员放松了对这一工作的领导。这种状况应当改变。不管什么时候，对于有功于革命事业的人加以优待和照顾，是国家和人民群众的一项光荣的职责和义务。各地应该进一步做好这项工作，更多地关心烈属、军属、残废军人和复员军人的生产和生活，创造可能的条件，使他们的积极性得到更大的发挥，使更多的人成为积极分子和模范人物，以促进我国的社会主义事业。
