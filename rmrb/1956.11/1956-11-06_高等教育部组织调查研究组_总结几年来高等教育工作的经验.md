The purpose is to summarize the experiences of higher education work in recent years, especially the experience of teaching reform, so that higher education work is more in line with China's reality and more suitable for the needs of China's socialist construction.

In order to implement the policy of continuing to increase the number of students as much as possible while ensuring a certain quality, this investigation will focus on checking the professional settings, training objectives, enrollment tasks, and graduate job assignments of higher education in recent years. It will also examine the available conditions such as teachers, equipment, and student sources, and summarize and study existing experiences and problems. At the same time, it will understand and study the quantity and quality of cadres needed by the country during the second and third Five-Year Plans, so as to study and solve important issues such as future training objectives, professional settings, graduation years, and enrollment plans.

The revision and implementation of teaching content and teaching plans is also one of the focuses of this investigation and research. Through this investigation and research, the revised teaching plans in the future will be able to fundamentally ensure the normal study of students and ensure a certain quality of the trained personnel. The revision and implementation of the teaching syllabus will also be checked and studied.

The investigation team will also check and summarize the scientific research work of universities and colleges in recent years, understand and study the implementation of the "Hundred Flowers Bloom" policy in scientific research work, and also study the relationship between teaching work and scientific research work, the connection and cooperation between universities and scientific research institutions and business departments, the supply of instruments and books and materials, the organization of scientific seminars, the editing of academic journals, and other aspects of the situation and problems.

This investigation and research work will select key points based on different types of universities and colleges and different types of problems, and conduct in-depth research relying on the strength of universities and colleges and the vast number of teachers.
