Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, November 19th: An ancient city built of rammed earth discovered in Zhengzhou has been confirmed as a relic from the early Shang Dynasty, dating back more than 3,300 years. Such an ancient city wall site is the first discovery of its kind in China.

Archaeological workers excavated eight deep trenches along the four sides of the ancient city wall, and nothing from later periods was found in the Shang Dynasty rammed earth. In a newly opened deep trench on the west wall, a soil pit containing a dog skeleton was discovered. Four dogs were neatly buried in the four corners of the pit, all lying flat with their heads facing inward and their tails facing outward. A group of dog burial pits arranged in an orderly manner was also found on the Shang Dynasty rammed earth in the northeast corner of the city; there were nine soil pits in total, containing more than 130 buried dogs. Judging from the stratigraphic relationship, these two dog burial pits also date back to the Shang Dynasty, but are slightly later than the rammed earth walls. The materials obtained from the deep trenches also indicate that the foundation of the rammed earth city wall was built on a reddish-brown soil surface, and the rammed earth wall was built by compacting this red soil layer by layer. In the past, when archaeological workers cleared all early Shang Dynasty sites in Zhengzhou, they always found that the bottom layer was pressed against this red soil surface. Based on the materials listed above, this ancient city can only be a relic from the early Shang Dynasty. The scope of the ancient city has also been measured. Its total area is 332,500 square meters, which is one-third larger than the modern city of Zhengzhou. This is a rectangular city, about 1,700 meters wide from east to west and 2,000 meters long from north to south. The rammed earth walls are generally four to seventeen meters thick, and some sections are as thick as twenty meters. Currently, most of the body of the Shang Dynasty rammed earth walls are buried underground, but a considerable length is still exposed on the ground intermittently. To the north of the modern city of Zhengzhou, a ridge of earth that has always been called "Zijing Mountain" by the people is actually a portion of the Shang Dynasty rammed earth city wall (with rammed earth from the Warring States period on top) that remains on the ground.

The discovery of the ancient Shang Dynasty city in Zhengzhou has aroused great attention from relevant departments of the Central Government and Henan Province. According to the instructions of the Ministry of Culture of the People's Republic of China, this ancient city site must be resolutely protected. No construction is allowed on or near the rammed earth city walls; no large-scale buildings will be built within the scope of the ancient city in the future. Important Shang Dynasty relics outside the city should also be properly protected.

### 郑州发现商代古城遗址  面积比郑州城大三分之一，墙厚四至二十公尺

    郑州发现商代古城遗址
    面积比郑州城大三分之一，墙厚四至二十公尺
    新华社郑州19日电　在郑州发现的用夯土筑成的古城，已经被证实是距今三千三百多年以前的商代早期的遗物。像这样古老的城墙遗址，在中国还是第一次发现。
    考古工作人员在这个古城四边的城墙上共挖开了八条深沟，从商代夯土中没有清理出任何晚期的东西。在西墙上新开的一条深沟里，发现了一个埋有狗骨架的土坑。坑的四角整整齐齐地埋着四只狗，都是头部向内尾部朝外平放着的。在东北城角的商代夯土上，并发现了一处排列得很有次序的埋狗的土坑群；土坑共有九个，埋的狗有一百三十多只。从地层叠压关系看，这两处埋狗的土坑也都是商代的，但比夯土墙要略晚一些。从开深沟所获得的材料还表明：夯土城墙的基础是建筑在一种褐红色土壤的地面上，夯土墙就是用这种红土逐层夯实后筑成的。考古工作人员以前在郑州清理所有的商代早期的遗址时，到最下层也都是压在这种红土地面上。从以上所列举的材料看，这座古城只能是商代早期的遗物。古城的范围也已经测量出来了。它的总面积是三十三万两千五百平方公尺，比近代的郑州城还要大三分之一。这是一座长方形的城，东西宽约一千七百公尺，南北长达两千公尺。夯土墙一般有四公尺到十七公尺厚，部分段厚达二十公尺。现在，商代夯土墙的墙身大部分都被埋在地面下了，但也有相当长的一段是断断续续地露在地面上的。在近代郑州城的北面，一向被人们称作“紫荆山”的一道土岭子，其实就是商代夯土城墙（上面压有战国夯土）残留在地面上的一部分。
    郑州商代古城的发现，已经引起中央和河南省有关部门的极大重视。根据中华人民共和国文化部指示的意见，这座古城遗址要坚决地保护起来。夯土城墙上和城墙附近的地方，一概不许动土；在古代城墙所包括的范围以内，今后不再新建大型的建筑物。城外有关的重要商代遗迹，也都要妥善地加以保护。
