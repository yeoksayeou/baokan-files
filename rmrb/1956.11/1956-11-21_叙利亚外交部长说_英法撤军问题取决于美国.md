Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, November 20th: Syrian Foreign Minister Bitar told United Press reporters in Damascus on November 18th that the United States could influence Britain and France to withdraw their troops from Egypt if they refused to leave. He said: "This matter depends on the United States. Now it's up to the United States."

Bitar said again in Damascus on November 19th that the Arab countries now believe that the responsibility for peace or war in the Middle East has become a major test for the U.S. government.

In his talks, Bitar asked the United States to understand the position of the Arab countries and put forward the conditions that must be met for the United States and the Arab countries to reach an understanding: British, French, and Israeli troops should withdraw from Egyptian territory as soon as possible, the Suez Canal issue should be resolved, Arab countries should be encouraged to maintain neutrality between East and West, and the Palestinian issue should not be raised at this time.

In his talks, Bitar also condemned the Baghdad Pact countries for plotting conspiracies against Syria and Jordan and participating in a plan aimed at overthrowing President Nasser's regime. He said that the purpose of the Baghdad Pact countries in doing so was to allow their policies to dominate the region, "to ultimately rule Syria, but I believe [they] are bound to fail."

    叙利亚外交部长说
    英法撤军问题取决于美国
    据新华社20日讯　大马士革消息：叙利亚外交部长比塔尔11月18日在大马士革对合众社记者说，美国能够影响英国和法国从埃及撤出它们的军队，如果它们拒绝离开的话。他说：“这件事取决于美国。现在就看美国了。”
    比塔尔11月19日在大马士革又说，阿拉伯国家现在认为，中东和战的责任，成为对美国政府的一个重大考验。
    比塔尔在谈话中要求美国了解阿拉伯国家的立场，并且提出了美国和阿拉伯国家达成谅解必须具备的条件：英国、法国和以色列军队尽快撤出埃及领土，解决苏伊士运河问题，鼓励阿拉伯国家在东西方之间维持中立以及目前不应当提出巴勒斯坦问题。
    比塔尔在谈话中还谴责巴格达条约国家策划对叙利亚和约旦施用阴谋，并且参与了目的在推翻纳赛尔总统政权的一项计划。他说，巴格达条约国家这样做的目的是要让它们的政策支配这个地区，“是要最后统治叙利亚，但是我相信（它们）一定要失败”。
