    A Superfluous Bonus
    Last June, when the China Tea Company received the 1954 enterprise bonus fund from the Ministry of Foreign Trade, it discovered that the bonus amount was more than 80,000 yuan higher than the original application.
    Why was the bonus so much higher? It turned out that the China Tea Company managed both trade enterprises and processing enterprises. The Ministry of Foreign Trade had stipulated that the bonus fund for trade enterprises should be determined by the success of completing the commodity circulation plan, profit plan, and profit delivery plan, with a maximum limit of 5% of the total annual wage. For processing enterprises, since there was no unified plan and the machinery, equipment, and technical conditions varied from factory to factory, it was difficult to set a uniform bonus standard. Therefore, the ministry entrusted the provincial people's committees to determine the bonus amount for each processing plant within the range of 5% of the total annual wage, based on the different situations in each area. Everyone thought this regulation was perfectly correct. In the implementation process, local trade bureaus approved bonuses at 5% of the total annual wage for factories with relatively good performance, 4% or 3% for those with relatively poor performance, and 2% for the worst-performing ones. The Tea Company reported the bonus figures submitted by the local trade bureaus and approved by the local people's committees, without expecting that the Ministry of Foreign Trade would disregard its own regulations and approve bonuses at 5% of the total wage for all enterprises, regardless of whether they were trade or processing enterprises, resulting in such a large surplus. Did the ministry intentionally violate its own regulations? Reportedly not. It was because the financial section of the Finance and Accounting Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Trade formulated the method, while the accounting section of the same bureau approved the bonus. Therefore, some people said that if the documents issuing the system and approving the bonus were not stamped with the same ministry's seal, someone might have found a reason to defend this not-so-small mistake.
    The Tea Company spent a lot of effort on this superfluous bonus, researching it many times, but couldn't find a suitable solution. If it were distributed as a bonus to the processing plants, then every plant, regardless of its performance, would receive the same highest bonus, which would not only lose the meaning of rewarding the advanced, but also violate the regulations of the higher authorities. However, it would also be wrong to leave this useful money idle without distributing it. So, they called the accounting section of the Finance and Accounting Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Trade to ask for instructions. They also felt a little embarrassed, but still gave this answer: "Temporarily keep it in your head office and wait for further instructions."
    Until the end of 1955, when the Tea Company's business was transferred to the leadership of two ministries, they called the Ministry of Foreign Trade again for instructions and proposed to return the money to the state treasury. What was the result? The Ministry of Foreign Trade not only did not support this legitimate proposal, but instead instructed the Tea Company to contact the unit that took over the processing plant business and transfer it over if possible. Some people said that this was truly a "good way" to cover up the mistake!
    This superfluous bonus was finally officially handed over to a new custodian – the Ministry of Agricultural Products Procurement – in April of this year.
    Since a bonus that couldn't find a way out for more than ten months has someone boldly taking it over, it is very likely to find a way out for it. However, it can be determined that no matter what aspect it finds its way out into, if it is not returned to the state treasury, it has still not found its true owner, and the way out will naturally not be appropriate. 　Shuren

    一笔多余的奖金
    去年6月中国茶叶公司从对外贸易部领到1954年度的企业奖励基金的时候，发现比原申请的奖金数字多了八万多元。
    为什么奖金会多出这笔钱来？原来中国茶叶公司掌管着贸易企业和加工企业两部分业务，对外贸易部曾规定，贸易企业的奖励基金，按完成商品流通计划、利润计划和利润上缴计划的好坏来决定提奖多少，最多不得超过全年工资总额的5％；加工企业，因为还没有统一计划，同时各地加工厂机器设备和技术条件不同，不好统一规定提奖标准，便委托各省人民委员会根据各地不同情况，在全年工资总额5％的范围内，决定各个加工厂应发的奖金数字。这个规定大家都认为是完全正确的。各地贸易局在执行中，因有的厂成绩比较好，即批准按全年工资总额5％提奖，有的成绩比较差，即按4％或3％提奖，最差的按2％提奖。茶叶公司就根据各地贸易局提出经当地人民委员会批准的提奖数字上报的，没有想到对外贸易部会不管自己的规定，不分贸易企业和加工企业，一律批准按工资总额5％提奖，结果就多出这么一笔巨款来。是不是这个部有意违反自己的规定呢？据说不是，而是因为制定这个办法的是对外贸易部的财务会计局财务处，批准提奖的是这个部同一个局的会计处。所以，有人说，如果不是颁发制度和批准提奖的公文都是盖的同一个部的大印的话，也许还会有人找出理由来为这个不大不小的错误辩护的。
    茶叶公司曾经为这笔多余的奖金费了很多心思，多次研究，都无法找到适当的出路。如果把它当做加工厂的奖金发下去，那末不论成绩好坏，每一个加工厂都得到了相同的最高的奖金，那就不仅失去了奖励先进的意义，同时也违反上级的规定。但不发下去让这笔有用的钱积压下来也是不对的。于是打电话向对外贸易部财务会计局会计处请示，他们也感到有些为难，但究竟还是作了这样的答复：“暂时放在你们总公司，听候处理”。
    直到1955年底，茶叶公司的业务划归两个部领导，又打电话向对外贸易部请示，并提出把这笔钱缴还国库。结果如何呢？对外贸易部不但不支持这个正当的主张，反而指示茶叶公司和接收加工厂业务的单位接洽，能移交过去就移交过去算了。有人说，这真是一个掩饰错误的“好办法”！
    这笔多余的奖金终于在今年4月正式换了新的保管人——农产品采购部。
    十来个月找不到出路的奖金，既然有人大胆地接它过去，那就很可能为它找到出路。但是，可以断定，不论它找到那方面的出路，如果不是交还国库，终究还是没有找到真正的主人，出路自然也就不会是适当的。　庶仁
