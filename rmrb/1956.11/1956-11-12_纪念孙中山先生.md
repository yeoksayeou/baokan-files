    In Memory of Mr. Sun Yat-sen
    Mao Zedong
    In memory of the great revolutionary pioneer Mr. Sun Yat-sen!

    In memory of his sharp struggle against the Chinese Reformists with a clear stance as a Chinese revolutionary democrat during the preparatory period of the Chinese democratic revolution. In this struggle, he was the banner of the Chinese revolutionary democrats.

    In memory of his great achievements in leading the people to overthrow the imperial system and establish the republic during the Xinhai Revolution.

    In memory of his great achievements during the first Kuomintang-Communist cooperation period in developing the old Three People's Principles into the New Three People's Principles.

    He left us many beneficial things in terms of political thought.

    Modern Chinese people, except for a handful of reactionaries, are all successors to Mr. Sun's revolutionary cause.

    We have completed the democratic revolution that Mr. Sun did not complete, and have developed this revolution into a socialist revolution. We are completing this revolution.

    Things are always developing. From the revolution of 1911, the Xinhai Revolution, to this year, only forty-five years have passed, and China's face has completely changed. In another forty-five years, it will be 2001, that is, when entering the 21st century, China's face will change even more dramatically. China will become a powerful socialist industrial country. China should be like this. Because China is a country with 9.6 million square kilometers of land and 600 million people, China should make greater contributions to mankind. And this contribution has been too small for a long time in the past. This makes us feel ashamed.

    But we must be humble. Not only should we be like this now, but we should also be like this after forty-five years, and we should always be like this. In international exchanges, the Chinese people should resolutely, thoroughly, cleanly, and completely eliminate great-power chauvinism.

    Mr. Sun was a humble man. I have heard him speak many times and felt that he had a magnificent spirit. From his attention to studying China's historical situation and current social conditions, and from his attention to studying foreign countries including the Soviet Union, I know that he was very modest.

    He devoted his whole life to transforming China with all his heart and soul, truly exhausting his energy and dying only after he had given his all.

    Like many great historical figures who stand on the positive side and guide the trends of the times, they all have their shortcomings, Mr. Sun also has his shortcomings. This should be explained from historical conditions so that people can understand, and one cannot be overly critical of predecessors.

### 纪念孙中山先生

    纪念孙中山先生
    毛泽东
    纪念伟大的革命先行者孙中山先生！
    纪念他在中国民主革命准备时期，以鲜明的中国革命民主派立场，同中国改良派作了尖锐的斗争。他在这一场斗争中是中国革命民主派的旗帜。
    纪念他在辛亥革命时期，领导人民推翻帝制、建立共和国的丰功伟绩。
    纪念他在第一次国共合作时期，把旧三民主义发展为新三民主义的丰功伟绩。
    他在政治思想方面留给我们许多有益的东西。
    现代中国人，除了一小撮反动分子以外，都是孙先生革命事业的继承者。
    我们完成了孙先生没有完成的民主革命，并且把这个革命发展为社会主义革命。我们正在完成这个革命。
    事物总是发展的。一九一一年的革命，即辛亥革命，到今年，不过四十五年，中国的面目完全变了。再过四十五年，就是二千零一年，也就是进到二十一世纪的时候，中国的面目更要大变。中国将变为一个强大的社会主义工业国。中国应当这样。因为中国是一个具有九百六十万平方公里土地和六万万人口的国家，中国应当对于人类有较大的贡献。而这种贡献，在过去一个长时期内，则是太少了。这使我们感到惭愧。
    但是要谦虚。不但现在应当这样，四十五年之后也应当这样，永远应当这样。中国人在国际交往方面，应当坚决、彻底、干净、全部地消灭大国主义。
    孙先生是一个谦虚的人。我听过他多次讲演，感到他有一种宏伟的气魄。从他注意研究中国历史情况和当前社会情况方面，又从他注意研究包括苏联在内的外国情况方面，知道他是很虚心的。
    他全心全意地为了改造中国而耗费了毕生的精力，真是鞠躬尽瘁，死而后已。
    像很多站在正面指导时代潮流的伟大历史人物大都有他们的缺点一样，孙先生也有他的缺点方面。这是要从历史条件加以说明，使人理解，不可以苛求于前人的。
