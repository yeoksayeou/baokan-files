Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 30th - Fuyang County in Zhejiang Province has resumed mass production of native paper. Since mid-September, hundreds of papermaking sheds on both banks of the Fuchun River have become active again. The county's 420 agricultural production cooperatives and paper production cooperatives will produce 909,507 pieces (blocks) of native paper in the fourth quarter of this year, an increase of more than two-fifths compared with the same period last year.

The output of Fuyang County's native paper accounts for one-third of the province's total, and its output value accounts for 40% of the county's total rural economy, with some townships reaching 80%. The county produces nearly 20 kinds of native paper, among which "Yuanshu" paper (cultural paper) and "Kengbian" paper (sanitary paper) are the most famous and are sold in 13 provinces and cities including Jiangsu, Shandong, and Beijing. However, since 1953, the county's output of native paper has declined year by year. By 1955, some areas had decreased by 30%. Since September of this year, the Fuyang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has resolutely implemented the central government's policy of comprehensively developing production and corrected the bias of neglecting native paper production in recent years. According to the decision of the Fuyang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the county focuses on developing both agriculture and paper industry. The 106 agricultural production cooperatives whose income from native paper accounts for more than half of the total income have been renamed paper production cooperatives, under the leadership of the Handicraft Industry Department. In order to support the production of native paper, supply and marketing cooperatives have increased the purchase price of native paper. The Fuyang County People's Committee has also equipped the agricultural technology promotion stations in various districts with technical cadres for papermaking.

    富阳土纸恢复大量生产
    新华社杭州30日电　浙江省富阳县的土纸恢复大量生产。9月中旬以来，富春江两岸数以百计的造纸棚都活跃起来了。全县四百二十个农业生产合作社和纸业生产合作社，将在今年第四季度造出九十万九千五百零七件（块）土纸，比去年同期的产量增加五分之二以上。
    富阳县土纸的产量占全省三分之一，产值占全县农村经济总值的40％，有的乡达到80％。这个县出产的土纸将近二十种，以元书纸（文化纸）和坑边纸（卫生纸）最为有名，行销江苏、山东、北京等十三个省、市。但是从1953年起，全县土纸产量逐年下降。到1955年，有的地区下降了30％。今年9月起，中共富阳县委员会坚决贯彻执行中央提出的全面发展生产的方针，纠正了几年来忽视土纸生产的偏向。根据中共富阳县委员会的决定，全县以同时发展农业和纸业为重点，土纸生产由手工业部领导，土纸收入占全部收入一半以上的一百零六个农业生产合作社改称为纸业生产合作社。为扶持土纸生产，供销合作社提高了土纸的收购价格。富阳县人民委员会还在各个区的农业技术推广站配备了造纸的技术干部。
