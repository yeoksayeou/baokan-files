Xinhua News Agency, 26th — At the closing ceremony of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Public Security Forces Activists' Representative Conference this morning, General Luo Ruiqing, Commander and Political Commissar of the Public Security Forces, delivered a report on the issues of the Public Security Forces closely linking with the people and carrying out border defense and internal security tasks.

In his report, General Luo Ruiqing said that China's border line is very long, and if we only rely on the border defense troops without relying on the people and without combining with the people, the work cannot be done well. He pointed out that the Public Security Forces have made achievements and contributions in carrying out border defense and internal security tasks in recent years, providing vigilance for the border defense of the motherland and ensuring the safety of cities, industrial and mining enterprises, and railways. However, there are also shortcomings and mistakes in our work, that is, we have not been closely enough connected with the people.

He said that the task of the Public Security Forces is political struggle against the enemy. Political struggle is a mass struggle. If we are separated from the people and do not get the support of the people, the struggle will not be victorious. General Luo Ruiqing said that our border inspection is to protect the people and should provide convenience to the people, not create obstacles and difficulties for the people. We are a socialist country, and the people have genuine freedom. Border defense troops should pay attention to this when carrying out their tasks.

General Luo Ruiqing also said that in interactions with friendly neighboring countries, border defense troops should resolutely abide by our country's foreign policy of peaceful coexistence, and in border defense exchanges with friendly neighboring countries, we must oppose great-power chauvinism, respect others, and maintain a friendly attitude towards the people of these countries.

General Luo Ruiqing finally said that we are not afraid of any imperialism, but we are afraid of being separated from the masses. Our enemies hope that we will be isolated among the people, but this hope can never be realized, because our interests are consistent with the interests of the people. If we have done something wrong, we must admit our mistakes to the people and resolutely correct them.

At the closing ceremony, the conference rewarded 242 outstanding public security soldiers, 16 companies, 9 platoons, and 21 squads, as well as 46 outstanding units.

    我们不怕任何帝国主义怕的是脱离人民群众
    罗瑞卿在公安军积极分子大会上号召依靠群众执行边防和内卫任务
    新华社26日讯　今天上午，在中国人民解放军公安军积极分子代表会议的闭幕式上，公安军司令员兼政治委员罗瑞卿大将就公安军密切联系人民群众、执行边防和内卫任务问题作了报告。
   罗瑞卿大将在报告中说，我国的边防线很长，如果只靠边防部队而不依靠人民，不和人民结合一起，工作就不能做好。他指出，几年来公安军执行边防、内卫任务是有成绩、有功劳的，使祖国的边防有了警戒，使城市、工矿、铁路的安全有了保证。但是，我们工作中也有缺点和错误，这就是密切联系人民群众不够。
    他说，公安军的任务是对敌政治斗争。政治斗争是一项群众性的斗争。如果离开人民，得不到人民的支持，斗争就得不到胜利。罗瑞卿大将说，我们的边防检查，是为了保卫人民，应当给人民以便利，不要给人民造成妨碍和困难。我们是社会主义国家，人民有真正的自由，这一点边防部队在执行任务中应当重视。
    罗瑞卿大将又说，边防部队在同友邻国家的交往中，应当坚决遵守我国和平共处的外交政策，在边防上与友邻国家交往中，必须反对大国主义，尊敬人家，对这些国家的人民抱友好态度。
    罗瑞卿大将最后说，我们对任何帝国主义都不害怕，但是我们怕的是脱离人民群众。我们的敌人希望我们在人民中遭到孤立，但是这个希望永远不能够实现，因为我们与人民的利益是一致的。如果我们有些事做错了，就要向老百姓认错，并坚决改正错误。
    在闭幕式上，大会奖励了二百四十二名优秀公安战士、十六个连、九个排和二十一个班等四十六个优秀单位。
