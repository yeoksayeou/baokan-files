Better Unleash the Potential of Athletes
Guo An
The performances of the Chinese Olympic sports delegation in Wuhan City over the past three days have been outstanding. The achievements of the young weightlifting and track and field athletes are particularly good, as they have broken national records one after another. The results in weightlifting and women's discus have also broken or approached the records of the first place winners at the last Olympic Games. However, in this competition, it can be seen that even the most outstanding athletes have not yet mastered techniques sufficiently in certain aspects, and their methods are not comprehensive enough, so their potential has not been fully realized. The lightest weightlifter, Chen Jingkai, achieved a clean and jerk result of 137.5 kilograms (breaking the world record for the third time), and his total of 322.5 kilograms for the three lifts of press, snatch, and clean and jerk also surpassed the 315 kilograms achieved by the lightest weightlifting champion of the 15th Olympic Games, the Soviet Union's Udotov. However, based on the fact that Chen Jingkai's snatch and press results are often equal, and sometimes his snatch result is even lower than his press (snatch requires higher technique, and the snatch results of world-renowned weightlifters are higher than their press results), and considering his good physical condition and strong legs, experts believe that Chen Jingkai still has a lot of potential. As long as he strengthens his training and improves his technique, he will surely achieve even more amazing results in the future. This feeling is not limited to Chen Jingkai alone; it can also be found in athletes like Shi Baozhu, Zheng Fengrong, and Cai Yishu. In the demonstration competition, Shi Baozhu threw the discus to 50 meters and 93 centimeters for the fourth time (only 49 centimeters short of the first place in the last Olympic Games). She happily told reporters: In the past, I often had problems such as releasing the discus too early or the direction being inaccurate, so the results were always between 45 and 46 meters. This time, when I released it, I felt everything was just right, and the result exceeded my long-awaited 50 meters. Although Zheng Fengrong only cleared 1 meter and 61.5 centimeters on her fifth attempt (breaking the national record of 1 meter and 61 centimeters), the audience felt that she jumped very easily. When the bar was raised to 1 meter and 63 centimeters, she still cleared it easily. At 1 meter and 65 centimeters, her body had already cleared, but she accidentally knocked the bar down with her hand. When the bar was raised to 4 meters and 25 centimeters, Cai Yishu also cleared it with his body, but knocked the bar down when landing. These all show that our young athletes are not yet proficient and comprehensive enough in terms of technique and method. If they strengthen their training targeting individual weaknesses, they will definitely be able to win honor for the country in the next Olympic Games.

    更好地发挥运动员的潜力
    国安
    中国奥林匹克体育代表团三天来在武汉市的表演比赛中，成绩是出色的。举重、田径的年轻运动员的成绩更是良好，他们一个又一个地打破了全国纪录。举重、女子铁饼的成绩还打破和接近了上届奥运会第一名的纪录。但是在这次比赛中可以看到即使是最优秀的运动员在某些项目方面，技术还掌握得不够熟练，方法还不够全面，因而潜在力量还没有充分发挥。最轻量级举重运动员陈镜开的挺举成绩达到了一百三十七点五公斤（第三次打破了世界纪录），推举、抓举、挺举的三项总成绩也达到了三百二十二点五公斤，而第十五届奥林匹克运动会最轻量级举重冠军苏联乌多多夫的成绩才三百十五公斤。但是根据陈镜开抓举和推举成绩经常相等，有时抓举成绩还比推举低（抓举需要更高的技术，世界著名的举重选手抓举成绩都比推举高），和他的良好的生理条件、强有力的双腿，因此专家们都认为陈镜开的身上还有不少潜力，只要加强锻炼，提高技术，将来一定会有更惊人的成绩。不光是陈镜开一个人，在石宝珠、郑凤荣、蔡艺墅等运动员中也会有这种感觉。石宝珠在表演比赛中，第四次将铁饼掷到了五十公尺九十三公分（比上届奥运会第一名仅差四十九公分）。她高兴地对记者说：过去老是因为铁饼出手过早、方向不准等，因此成绩终是在四十五、六公尺之间，这次出手时，觉得一切都很合适，结果果然超过了我盼望已久的五十公尺的成绩。郑凤荣虽然在第五次才跳过了一公尺六十一点五公分（破一公尺六十一的全国纪录），但观众都觉得她跳得很轻松，在横竿加到一公尺六十三公分时，她还是轻松地跳了过去。到一公尺六十五公分时，身体已跳过，但因手不慎而将横竿碰落。蔡艺墅在横竿加到了四公尺二十五公分时，也是身体已过而在落下时才碰掉了横竿。这些都说明了我们年轻的运动员在技术和方法方面还不够熟练、全面。假如针对个别的缺点，加强训练，他们在下一届奥运会中一定能为国家取得荣誉。
