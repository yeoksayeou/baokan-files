Lu Xun

Mongolian writer Ce·erhamusulun

The sands of the Gobi Desert are like a brazier, burning the soles of shoes; scorching the feet. If there were a skilled speaker, he would say: This sun could burn a felt mat to ashes. There was a yurt with five "hana" [note], the surrounding felt rolled up, with a crescent-shaped shade spread out behind it, as if welcoming guests to cool off. A thin felt mat was folded in double layers, and an old herdsman sat there reading. "Old father, what book are you reading?" I asked him. "Ah! Child, don't disturb me! I am talking with the famous writer Lu Xun." Only then did I see that he was holding "The True Story of Ah Q." The old man's mind was concentrated on that book, not bothering to wipe the sweat from his face. The old man's heart was drawn in by the great artistic power, and he didn't even bother to look up at me, his visitor. The old man Aolijibei was so engrossed, reading from the preface to the conclusion in a short time. "What a good story!" The old man exclaimed, taking off his reading glasses, "Truly a good writer!" The old man praised, wiping away the sweat. "The same age as me - seventy-five years old. But compared to me, he is much younger!" The old Mongolian herdsman said, stroking his silver-grey beard with emotion. In the hands of our herdsmen and workers, or on the desks of girls and children, the works of the great Chinese Gorky - Lu Xun - are respected and circulated everywhere.

[Note] "Hana" are walls made of thin wooden sticks in a yurt.

    蒙古作家　策·尔哈木苏伦戈壁的沙滩好像火盆，烧着鞋底；烫透脚心，假如有一个善于说话的人，他会说：这太阳会把毡垫烧成灰烬。有一顶五个“哈那”〔注〕的蒙古包，那围着的毡子卷起来了，包后展开了一条月牙般的荫影，像是欢迎着乘凉的客人。薄薄的毡垫子叠成双层，一个老牧人坐在那里读书。“老爸爸，您在读着什么书？”我问他。“嗳！孩子你不要打搅我！我在同有名的作家鲁迅谈着话。这时候我才看见他手拿的是“阿Q正传”。老人的心思集中在那一本书上，顾不得擦一擦淌在脸上的汗珠，老人的心情被伟大的艺术力量所吸引，更顾不得抬头看一看我这来访的客人。奥力吉贝老人就这样聚精会神，不多时从序言读到了结语。“多么好的故事啊！”老人一边赞叹，一边摘下了老花眼镜，“真是个好作家！”老人一边夸奖，一边擦着汗珠。“同我一样的年纪——七十五岁的人。但是比起我来，却年青的多了！”这位蒙古老牧人一边这样说着，一边激动地捋着他那银灰色的胡须。在我们的牧人们、工人们的手里，或者在姑娘们和孩子们的书桌上，伟大的中国的高尔基——鲁迅的著作就这样到处受尊敬，到处流传。
    〔注〕“哈那”是蒙古包里用细木棍编成的墙。
