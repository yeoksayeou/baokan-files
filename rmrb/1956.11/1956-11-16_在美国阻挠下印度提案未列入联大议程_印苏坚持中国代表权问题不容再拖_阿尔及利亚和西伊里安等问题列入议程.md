Xinhua News Agency, November 15th: According to TASS, New York, November 15th: The General Committee of the United Nations General Assembly discussed the preliminary agenda of the UN General Assembly during its morning and afternoon sessions on November 14th. The meeting decided to include the Cyprus issue, the Algerian issue, and the West Irian issue on the agenda of the General Assembly. The issue of China's representation, proposed by the Indian representative, was not included on the agenda due to US obstruction. Most other issues on the preliminary agenda were adopted without opposition. Despite the opposition of the representative of the Union of South Africa, the issue of racial discrimination in the Union of South Africa was also included on the agenda.

Regarding the Cyprus issue, there were two agenda items: one proposed by Greece concerning the application of the principles of equality and self-governance to the residents of Cyprus Island, and the other proposed by Britain accusing Greece of "supporting terrorist activities in Cyprus." The representatives of the Soviet Union and Egypt supported the item proposed by Greece. Egyptian representative Loutfi pointed out that the use of Cyprus as a base for the Anglo-French aggression against Egypt had exacerbated the Cyprus issue.

There was fierce debate over the West Irian issue. Representatives of colonial countries opposed including this issue on the agenda. The French representative even openly demanded that "the agenda not be piled up" with colonial issues. The representatives of India, the Soviet Union, and Indonesia firmly advocated for including the West Irian issue on the agenda. The result of the vote was to include the issue on the agenda. Representatives of India, Pakistan, the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Egypt, and El Salvador voted in favor. Representatives of Britain, France, and Denmark opposed. Representatives of the United States, Turkey, Peru, the Dominican Republic, and the Chiang Kai-shek clique abstained.

During the afternoon session, the General Committee mainly discussed the Indian proposal to include the issue of China's representation in the United Nations on the meeting agenda.

Indian representative Menon firmly argued that the General Assembly should discuss the issue of China's representation in the United Nations. He emphasized that this issue could no longer be delayed. Menon said that if there was no true representative of China in the United Nations, many difficulties would arise. Life resolutely demands a good solution to this problem. This issue is closely related to ensuring stability and easing the situation in Asia.

The Indian representative said that without the cooperation of the government of the People's Republic of China—the only legitimate government of China—the United Nations cannot effectively discuss major international issues. This is not a question of admitting a new member state. The question is to change an extremely abnormal situation, namely, that for several years there has effectively been no representation in the United Nations for a major country with a population of six hundred million.

US representative Lodge, disregarding the procedural rules of the United Nations, took crude destructive actions in an attempt to obstruct the current session of the United Nations General Assembly from discussing this extremely important international issue. The General Committee was only supposed to discuss the Indian proposal to review the issue of China's representation in the United Nations, but Lodge disregarded this and put forward his own proposal. He suggested, first, not to include the Indian proposal on the agenda, and second, not to discuss any proposals regarding the issue of China's representation at this session of the General Assembly. He also insisted on voting on his proposal first.

Soviet representative Kuznetsov spoke in support of the Indian proposal. He said that restoring the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations is one of the most urgent and important tasks of the eleventh session of the United Nations General Assembly. This issue should have been resolved long ago.

In his speech, Kuznetsov spoke of the achievements of the People's Republic of China in the more than seven years since its founding and its growing influence in international affairs. He said that China's artificial exclusion from the United Nations is primarily to the detriment of the United Nations itself.

The Soviet representative concluded by saying that the intolerable situation in which representatives of the Chinese people cannot participate in the work of the United Nations must end. The Soviet delegation firmly supports the Indian delegation's proposal to include the issue of restoring the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China on the agenda of the current session of the United Nations General Assembly.

Danish representative Lannon and Czechoslovak representative Peterka spoke in support of the Indian proposal.

The representatives of Britain, France, Turkey, Peru, and the Dominican Republic took on the disreputable task of defending the US proposal. It was learned outside the General Assembly that Britain agreed to support the US position on this issue in exchange for US public support for Britain in the Anglo-French aggression against Egypt.

Indian representative Menon and Soviet representative Kuznetsov spoke again to condemn the US actions that violated the rules of procedure.

Even the representative of El Salvador, who took the same position as the United States on the substance of recognizing China's representation, admitted that Lodge's proposal was in violation of the rules of procedure.

The chairman of the meeting, Narady, disregarding the existing rules of procedure, repeatedly attempted to prove the "legality" of the US proposal and gave the US proposal the opportunity to be voted on first, thereby sacrificing the Indian proposal.

The US delegation, with the help of the chairman, forced the meeting to accept a resolution to prioritize the US proposal. The US proposal was then put to a vote and passed by a vote of eight to five. The United States, Britain, France, Turkey, Pakistan, the Dominican Republic, Peru, and the Chiang Kai-shek elements voted in favor, while the delegations of the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, India, Egypt, and Denmark voted against. The representative of El Salvador abstained. The Indian proposal was not put to a vote.

    在美国阻挠下印度提案未列入联大议程
    印苏坚持中国代表权问题不容再拖
    阿尔及利亚和西伊里安等问题列入议程
    新华社15日讯　据塔斯社纽约15日讯：联合国大会总务委员会14日上午会议和下午会议讨论了联合国大会的预备议程。会议决定把塞浦路斯问题、阿尔及利亚问题和西伊里安问题等列入大会议程。印度代表提出的中国代表权问题在美国阻挠下没有被列入议程。预备议程上的其他大部分问题都在没有人表示反对的情况下获得通过。不顾南非联邦代表的反对，南非联邦的种族歧视问题也被列入了议程。
    关于塞浦路斯问题的议程有两个项目，一个是希腊提出的关于对塞浦路斯岛居民适用平等、自治原则的问题，另一个是英国提出的控诉希腊“在塞浦路斯支持恐怖活动”的问题。苏联和埃及的代表支持希腊所提出的项目。埃及代表卢特菲指出，英法侵略军利用塞浦路斯作为侵略埃及的基地使塞浦路斯问题更加尖锐化了。
    在西伊里安问题上发生了激烈的争论。殖民国家的代表反对把这个问题列入议程。法国代表竟公然要求“不要让日程上堆满了”殖民地问题。印度、苏联和印度尼西亚的代表坚决主张把西伊里安问题列入议程。表决结果决定把这个问题列入议程。投赞成票的是印度、巴基斯坦、苏联、捷克斯洛伐克、埃及和萨尔瓦多的代表。反对的是英国、法国和丹麦的代表。美国、土耳其、秘鲁、多米尼加共和国和蒋介石集团的代表弃权。
    总务委员会在下午会议上主要讨论了印度提出的关于把中国在联合国中的代表权问题列入会议议程的建议。
    印度代表梅农坚决主张大会应当讨论中国在联合国中的代表权的问题。他着重指出，这个问题不能再拖延了。梅农说，如果联合国中没有真正的中国代表，那就会产生很多困难。生活坚决要求很好地解决这个问题。这个问题是同保证稳定和缓和亚洲的局势有密切联系的。
    印度代表说，没有中华人民共和国政府——中国唯一合法政府的合作，联合国就不可能有效地讨论重大的国际问题。这个问题不是一个接纳新会员国的问题。问题在于改变一种极不正常的状况，即好几年来在联合国里事实上没有拥有六亿人口的大国的代表。
    美国代表洛奇竟然不顾联合国的程序规则，采取粗暴的破坏行动，企图阻挠本届联合国大会讨论这一极重要的国际问题。总务委员会本来只应当讨论印度提出的关于审查中国在联合国代表权问题的建议，可是洛奇不顾这一点而提出了自己的建议。他建议，第一、不把印度的建议列入议程，第二、在这次大会上根本不讨论关于中国代表权问题的任何提案。他还坚持要先表决他的提案。
    苏联代表库兹涅佐夫发言支持印度的建议。他说，恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法权利是联合国大会第十一届会议刻不容缓和最重要的任务之一。这个问题早就应该解决的了。
    库兹涅佐夫在发言里谈到了中华人民共和国成立七年多以来的成就和它在国际事务中越来越大的影响。他说，中国被人为地排除在联合国以外，遭受损失的首先还是联合国自己。
    苏联代表最后说，必须结束中国人民代表不能参加联合国工作这种不能容忍的状况。苏联代表团坚决支持印度代表团关于将恢复中华人民共和国合法权利问题列入联合国大会本届会议议程的提案。
    丹麦代表兰农和捷克斯洛伐克代表彼得热尔卡发言支持印度的提案。
    英国、法国、土耳其、秘鲁、多米尼加共和国代表担负了替美国提案辩护的不体面的任务。据大会会外获悉，英国同意支持美国在这一问题上的立场，是为了换取美国在英法侵略埃及问题上公开支持英国。
    印度代表梅农和苏联代表库兹涅佐夫再次发言斥责美国破坏议事规则的行为。
    甚至在承认中国代表权问题的实质上同美国采取同一立场的萨尔瓦多代表也承认，洛奇的建议是违反程序规则的。
    会议主席那拉底不顾现行的程序规则不止一次企图证明美国提案的“合法性”，并且让美国提案得到优先表决的机会，这就牺牲了印度的提案。
    美国代表团利用了主席的帮忙，强迫会议接受了优先表决美国提案的决议。接着美国提案提付表决，结果以八票对五票获得通过。美国、英国、法国、土耳其、巴基斯坦、多米尼加共和国、秘鲁和蒋介石分子赞成，苏联、捷克斯洛伐克、印度、埃及和丹麦五国代表团投票反对。萨尔瓦多代表弃权。印度提案没有提付表决。
