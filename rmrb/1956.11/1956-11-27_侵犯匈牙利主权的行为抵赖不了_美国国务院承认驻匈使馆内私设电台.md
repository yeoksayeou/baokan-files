Xinhua News Agency, 26th: Washington News - The U.S. State Department admitted on the 24th that the United States had used a secret shortwave transmitter inside the U.S. Embassy in Budapest.

The State Department attempted to defend this illegal act, insisting that the radio transmitter was "used for a few days" only during the time when normal communications in Hungary were interrupted. However, the Hungarian government pointed out in a note to the United States on the 24th that the United States was continuing to use this secret radio station.

    美国国务院承认驻匈使馆内私设电台
    新华社26日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务院24日承认，美国曾经在布达佩斯的美国使馆内使用了秘密的短波发报机。
    国务院企图为这种非法行为辩护，硬说这种无线电发报机只是在匈牙利正常的通讯停顿的日子里“用了几天”。但是匈牙利政府在24日给美国的照会中指出，美国继续在使用这种秘密电台。
