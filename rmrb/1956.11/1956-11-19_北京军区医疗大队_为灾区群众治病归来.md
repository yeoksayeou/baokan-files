    Xinhua News Agency, 17th. The six medical detachments of the Beijing Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, which treated disaster victims in the water-stricken areas of Hebei Province, have recently returned to their original units. In more than two months, they visited fourteen counties, treated more than 100,000 patients, and helped to prevent the spread of disease in the disaster areas.
    These six medical detachments were composed of a total of one hundred and ninety-four experienced medical personnel. They arrived in the disaster area on September 1. In the process of treating the people in the disaster area, they demonstrated the noble qualities of the people's army. Military doctor Li Gengfu rescued six critically ill patients one after another. One of them was a patient who went into anaphylactic shock from penicillin, and his pulse was almost undetectable. With Li Gengfu's calm and active rescue efforts, the patient was finally brought back from the brink of death. Once, during a night visit, it was raining heavily. Pharmacist Zhang Bingyao took off his raincoat and covered the medicine chest, while he himself was drenched in the rain, wading for more than thirty li. Yuan Guoying's child in Dagukou Village, Wu Yi County, suffered from pertussis, but the medical team did not have streptomycin. Hong Sheng took out his own money to buy medicine for him. The people in the disaster area wrote a large number of thank-you letters to the medical team and also sent many banners.

    北京军区医疗大队
    为灾区群众治病归来
    新华社17日讯　在河北省遭受水灾地区为灾民治病的中国人民解放军北京军区的六个医疗大队，最近全部返回原部。他们在两个多月中一共到过十四个县，治疗病人十万多人次，帮助制止了灾区疾病的蔓延。
    这六个医疗大队共由一百九十四名有经验的医务人员组成，他们是9月1日到灾区的。在为灾区人民治病过程中表现了人民军队的高贵品质。军医李耕夫曾先后抢救了六个垂危的病人，其中有一名青霉素过敏休克病人，脉搏几乎摸不到了，在李耕夫沉着、积极的抢救下，终于使病人转危为安。在一次夜间出诊时，大雨滂沱，司药张秉尧脱下自己身上的雨衣盖在药箱上，自己被雨淋着，淌水走了三十多里路。武邑县大谷口村袁国英的孩子得了百日咳，但是医疗队没带链霉素，鸿升拿出自己的钱给他买了药。灾区人民给医疗队写了大批感谢信，还送了许多锦旗。
