Xinhua News Agency, 11th: The People's Publishing House published the commemorative edition of "Selected Works of Sun Yat-sen" today, and will continue to publish it in large quantities.

The selected works are divided into two volumes, with the title on the cover handwritten by Soong Ching Ling. The selected works include 69 articles, declarations, speeches, and letters, totaling more than 700,000 words. They include Sun Yat-sen's works before, during, and after the reorganization of the Kuomintang in 1923. These works represent Sun Yat-sen's main ideas in various historical periods.

The articles in the selected works are arranged in chronological order of writing or publication. Because the Kuomintang government did not publish a relatively complete collection of Sun Yat-sen's works, the "A Draft History of the Chinese Kuomintang" published by Shanghai Minzhi Book Company in 1929 and the "Complete Works of the Premier" published in 1930 were used for detailed revision during the compilation of this selected works. In addition, whenever it was possible to find the original manuscript or the original printed version of Sun Yat-sen's article, it was revised based on this original manuscript or printed version. For example, "The True Solution of the Chinese Question" was retranslated based on the original English manuscript, the inaugural speech of "Min Bao" was revised based on the first issue of "Min Bao," and the "Letter to Chiang Kai-shek" was revised based on the original facsimile.

Sun Yat-sen's calligraphy—"The Fundamentals of National Reconstruction"—was also photolithographically published yesterday by the People's Fine Arts Publishing House. This manuscript was written by Sun Yat-sen at the General Headquarters in Guangzhou in 1924. It is now made into a collotype edition and printed on Xuan paper, preserving the true appearance of the calligraphy.

    “孙中山选集”昨日出版
    新华社11日讯“孙中山选集”今天由人民出版社出版了纪念本，并将陆续大量出版。
    选集分上下两卷，封面上有宋庆龄亲笔题字。选入的著作有文章、宣言、演说和函电等六十九篇，共约七十多万字。包括孙中山先生在1923年进行国民党改组以前、改组时期和改组以后的著作。这些著作代表了孙中山先生在各个历史时期的主要思想。
    选集中的文章顺序，都按照写作或发表的年月排列的。因国民党统治时期没有出版过比较完善的孙中山的文集，在这次编辑选集时曾用上海民智书局1929年版的“中国国民党史稿”、1930年版“总理全集”等版本详加校订。此外，凡是能够找到孙中山先生文章影印的原稿或者最初的印本，便根据这种原稿或印本校订，如“中国问题的真解决”是根据影印的英文原稿重译的，“民报”发刊词是根据“民报”第一号校订的，“致蒋介石手札”是根据影印原件校订的。
    孙中山先生的遗墨——“建国大纲”，也在昨天由人民美术出版社影印出版。这部手稿是1924年孙中山先生在广州大本营写的。现在制成可罗版，用宣纸印刷的，保存了遗墨的真迹。
