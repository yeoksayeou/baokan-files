    A Few Words About My Art Exhibition
    Yu Jianhua
    The Chinese Artists Association is scheduled to hold a Chinese painting exhibition for me at the Shenwumen of the Palace Museum from November 24th to December 9th. I think although I often held solo exhibitions in Shanghai in my early years, I have not dared to exhibit in Beijing since liberation, especially in Beijing. Now, under the call of "Let a hundred flowers bloom," this little wildflower of mine has boldly come to the garden to join in the fun.

    Shandong has never been known as a place for painters, and I was born in Jinan, a place not known for painters. I loved painting since I was a child, and I was once rapped on the knuckles by my teacher for painting. It was not until I was twenty-one (1915) that I formally studied painting at Beijing Higher Normal School. At first, I also studied Western painting. The following year, I began to learn landscape painting from my late teacher, Mr. Chen Shizeng, but I didn't learn it well, and Mr. Chen passed away. During that time, I also thought about specializing in watercolor painting. Later, I went to Shanghai and associated with Mr. Huang Binhong, Zhang Shanzi, Zhang Daqian, Xiong Songquan, and others, and organized the "Rotten Comics Society." Daqian was then specializing in learning from Shi Tao, and he advised me to specialize in learning from Gong Banqian. I thought specializing in one school would be too little change, and Gong Banqian's painting style was really thankless. I studied extensively from Shi Tao, Shi Xi, Qu Shan, as well as Tian Shu, Shi Tian, Zhong Gui, and Shu Ming (obeying my late teacher's instructions, I never learned from the Four Wangs). Although my painting style has changed, I have only learned from the ancients, only gained a bit of superficial knowledge. Without the ancients, I am nothing, and I feel really empty.

    "Learning from nature is better than learning from the ancients." From the summer of 1930, I began to sketch from nature. Initially, I went to Yandang Mountain. The overlapping peaks, strange peaks and waterfalls, even a stone or a tree, could all be painted. Everywhere were good drafts that the ancients had never painted, and everywhere were good compositions that I could not have imagined at home. I stayed there for a month and painted six albums. When I returned to Shanghai, my colleagues admired them quite a bit. After that, I was determined to make more travel sketches during the holidays, painting the nearby mountains during the spring break and the distant mountains during the summer vacation. So, I left my footprints in Tiantai, Xianxia, Jianglang, Longhu, Guifeng, Zhuji, Xikou, Siming, Lanke, Kuanglu, Huangshan, Baiyue, Jiuhua, Taishan, and Huashan. Wherever I went, I painted and wrote travel notes. I accumulated dozens of sketchbooks and six large volumes of travel notes. During the Anti-Japanese War, I painted Gushan in Fuzhou and the Wuyi Nine Bends in Chong'an. After liberation, I painted Taishan, Hengshan, and Wutai Mountain. I fell off a mule on Wutai Mountain and almost became someone who "loved famous mountains and did not know where he would end up."

    In these decades, I have also seen many famous works of past dynasties. I have seen a great many works from the Ming and Qing dynasties, and I have also seen some works from the Song and Yuan dynasties, and even the Five Dynasties, Sui and Tang dynasties. What I have seen, I have absorbed; what I have absorbed, I have improved my own works.

    Look, after forty years of effort, sketching dozens of famous mountains, seeing thousands of famous paintings, and painting countless Xuan paper, I should be painting well, right? Unfortunately, I have everything, except the talent for painting. Therefore, although I have worked hard, my achievements are too few, my hopes are too high, and my charm is insufficient. Although I have lived in the South for more than thirty years, and most of my paintings are of Southern landscapes, the boorishness of a Shandong person seems to have not changed much. Now I have to call it "local nationality" or "personality."

    This stubborn personality, although it has prevented my progress, has also prevented my degradation. It has prevented me from adopting the vulgar style of "speculation" and "glibness" that caters to the popular taste.

    This exhibition features 120 works, which are a part of my works from the last ten years. The large ones include the "Panoramic View of Guifeng" and "Grand View of Huangshan," both five feet wide and four panels long. The small ones include "Pine Trees of Huangshan," which are about a foot long. They can be divided into two categories: one is imaginary, and the other is sketched from life, but the sketches from life are not sketching exercises, but processed works. Whether imaginary or sketched from life, all the drafts are my own, and all the compositions are original. That is to say, these paintings, no matter from which aspect you look at them, are my own. They are different from the ancients and different from the moderns. Only this point makes me feel quite proud, and it is because of this point that I am willing to hold an exhibition. Wildflowers are certainly not as good as peonies, peonies, hibiscus, and chrysanthemums, but a small flower next to a large flower, swaying in the wind and being carefree, does not feel ugly either.

    Most of my models are famous mountains in China. For many people who have lived in Beijing for a long time and do not have time to travel, I would like to offer a chance to "travel while lying down."

    Finally, I think there are still many people painting in our country, but there are too few people engaged in theory. I now have a tendency to specialize in theory, and I may no longer paint, so it will not be easy to hold a solo exhibition again in the future, but it does not mean that I will close the door.

    为我的画展说几句话
    俞剑华
    中国美术家协会定于11月24日到12月9日在故宫神武门为我举行一个国画展览。我想我虽然早年在上海也常常举行个展，但是在解放以后，特别是在北京，却未敢展出。目前在百花齐放的号召下，我这朵小小的野花，也就大胆到花园里来凑凑热闹。
    山东向来是不出画家的地方，我就生在不出画家的济南。从小就喜欢画画，因为画画曾被老师敲过手心。二十一岁（1915）才到北京高师正式学画，起初也是学的西画，第二年开始从先师陈师曾先生学山水，没有学好，陈先生就去世了。其间也曾想专画水彩画。后来到了上海，与黄宾虹、张善孖、张大千、熊松泉诸先生往还，组织“烂漫画社”。大千那时专学石涛，他劝我专学龚半千。我想专学一家，太少变化，而龚半千的画风实在是吃力不讨好。我就遍学石涛、石溪、瞿山以及田叔、石田、仲圭、叔明诸家（遵守先师遗训，绝不学四王），画风虽有变化，但究竟只学古人，不过得点皮毛，离开古人，自己竟一无所有，实在感觉空虚。
    “师古人不如师造化”，从1930年夏天起，开始实地写生，最初是到雁荡山，所见层峦叠嶂、奇峰异瀑，甚至一石一树，处处都可入画，处处都是古人没有画过的好稿本，处处都是在家里所意想不到的好章法。在那儿住了一个月，画了六本册页，回到上海，同道看了，也颇为欣赏。以后就坚定利用假期多作旅行写生，每年春假画近的山，暑假画远的山。于是天台、仙霞、江郎、龙虎、龟峰、诸暨、溪口、四明、烂柯、匡庐、黄山、白岳、九华、泰山、崂山、华山，无不有我的足迹，每到一处，一边作画，一边作游记，所积写生画稿数十册，游记六大本。抗战期间，曾画过福州的鼓山、崇安的武夷九曲。解放以后，曾画过泰山、恒山、五台山，在五台山从骡子上摔下来，几乎成为“好游名山、不知所终”。
    在这几十年间也陆续看了不少的历代名迹，不但明清的看得极多，就是宋元的以至五代隋唐的，也有所寓目。有所寓目，就有所吸收；有所吸收，对于自己的作品就有所改进。
    看吧，用了四十年的功夫，写生了几十座名山，看了上千张的名画，涂抹了不计其数的宣纸，总应该画的像样了吧？可惜我万事俱备，就差一样作画的天才，因此用力虽勤，成就太少，厚望有余，气韵不足。虽然住在南方已逾三十年，所画又多系南方山水，但山东人的侉气，似乎并未改掉多少，现在只好美其名叫“地方的民族性”，或者叫它“个性”吧。
    这个顽强的个性，虽然阻止了我的进步，但是也阻止了我的堕落，就是它阻止了我向“投机取巧”“油腔滑调”那种迎合时好的庸俗作风。
    这次展出品一百二十幅，是最近十年以来作品的一部分，大的有五尺四幅通景的“龟峰全景”和“黄山大观”，小的也有尺来长的“黄山松树”。其中可分两大类：一类是写想的，一类是写生的，但写生的并非写生习作，而是经过加工的。无论写想写生，所有的稿子都是自己的，所有的构图都是自出心裁的，就是说这些画无论从哪一方面看，都是我自己的，既不同于古人，也不同于今人，只有这一点是颇觉自豪的，也就是因为有这一点，才愿意举行展览。野花当然比不上牡丹、芍药、芙蓉、菊花，但大花旁边一朵小花，临风摇曳，悠然自得，也不觉其丑。
    我的粉本，大半是国内名山，对于许多久居北京不暇出游的人，我想供献一个“卧游”的机会。
    最后，我认为我国画画的人还多，搞理论的人实在太少，我现在已有专搞理论的倾向，可能不再画画，将来就不容易再举行个展了，不过并不是说就此关门。（附图片）
