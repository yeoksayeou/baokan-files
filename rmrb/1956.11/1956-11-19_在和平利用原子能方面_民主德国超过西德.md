Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 18th – Deputy Prime Minister of East Germany and Chairman of the Industrial and Transportation Affairs Committee, Selbmann, said on the 15th that East Germany has made great progress in applying atomic energy to industry and has significantly surpassed the level of West Germany.

Selbmann said in a Berlin television broadcast that the atomic power station with a generating capacity of 70,000 kilowatts, which East Germany plans to build during the second Five-Year Plan, will be the first atomic power station in Germany serving peaceful purposes. Selbmann also said that East Germany's telecommunications industry has also made significant technological progress in recent years. For example, electronically controlled teletypewriters are already in production, which has brought East Germany's telecommunications technology to world standards.

In East Germany's television industry, the broadcasting and receiving equipment have been newly improved. In the near future, television programs will be viewable throughout East Germany, and unaffected by adverse weather conditions.

    在和平利用原子能方面
    民主德国超过西德
    新华社柏林18日电　民主德国副总理兼工业和交通事业委员会主席赛尔柏曼15日说，民主德国在把原子能应用于工业方面已经有了很大的进展，并且显著地超过了西德的水平。
    赛尔柏曼在柏林电视广播中说，民主德国预定在第二个五年计划期间建成的有七万瓩发电能力的原子能发电站，将是全德的第一座为和平服务的原子能发电站。赛尔柏曼还说，民主德国的电讯事业近年来也取得了重大的技术进步，例如电子操纵的电传打字机已经在生产中，这样就使民主德国的电讯技术达到了世界水平。
    在民主德国的电视事业方面，播送和收受的设备都已经有了新的改善，不久以后，在民主德国各地都可以看到电视节目，并且不受恶劣天气的影响。
