Great Man, Immortal Cause!
By Lin Gang, Our Staff Reporter

    The "Exhibition of the Life and Deeds of Mr. Sun Yat-sen" is being held at the Sun Yat-sen Hall in Zhongshan Park, Beijing. Chairman Mao Zedong personally inscribed the nameplate for this exhibition. Stepping into the high-ceilinged wooden hall of Zhongshan Hall, one is greeted by a plaster statue of Mr. Sun Yat-sen.

    A giant stands before us. He dedicated his entire life to the independence and freedom of the motherland. He was a man of great courage. In forty years of revolutionary struggle, he encountered countless difficulties and failures, yet he marched forward, always holding his head high, raising the banner of patriotism and anti-imperialism and anti-feudalism, and completed the glorious path of his life.

    On the screen in front of Zhongshan Hall are Chairman Mao's quotations made of gold letters. Our beloved leader gave an extremely high evaluation to this great revolutionary pioneer.

    The exhibition mainly displays photographs, as well as some historical relics: Mr. Sun's handwritten "Fundamentals of National Reconstruction" and other manuscripts, his posthumous works.... The photos are arranged in chronological order. We seem to be reading an illustrated biography of Mr. Sun Yat-sen.

    Cuiheng Village, a peaceful village in southern China, is known for its beautiful mountains and clear waters. Sun Yat-sen was born and raised there. Mr. Sun grew up in an era when the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom revolutionary movement had just passed its climax. From childhood, he loved to listen to the stories of Hong Xiuquan and Yang Xiuqing. From childhood, the seeds of revolution were sown in the heart of this son of a peasant.

    His initial political views were expressed in the "Letter to Li Hongzhang," which consisted of more than nine thousand words, reflecting the profound influence of reformist ideas he received in his early years. The Sino-Japanese War profoundly exposed the crisis of China being reduced to a colony, while the Qing government was becoming increasingly昏庸腐朽 (incompetent and corrupt). Reality awakened this sharp-eyed young patriot. He quickly concluded that peaceful reform was hopeless and that revolution was the only way out. In 1894, Sun Yat-sen left for Honolulu and founded the earliest bourgeois revolutionary group in China—the Revive China Society. A few months after the signing of the humiliating Treaty of Shimonoseki, he led the first armed uprising in Guangzhou. This uprising failed due to a lack of secrecy, and Sun Yat-sen went into exile overseas. The young revolutionary traveled around promoting revolution and gathering comrades. He became the recognized revolutionary leader.

    In the first few years of the twentieth century, organized revolutionary activities and spontaneous peasant uprisings rose up. Sun Yat-sen realized that to overthrow the Qing dynasty, these scattered revolutionary forces must be concentrated and organized. Thus, in 1905, Sun Yat-sen united revolutionaries from seventeen provinces in Japan and formed the Tongmenghui (Chinese United League). He was elected as the Premier.

    In the "Manifesto of the Chinese United League," Sun Yat-sen put forward the revolutionary democratic program of "Expelling the Tartars, restoring China, establishing a republic, and equalizing land rights." In Chinese history, Sun Yat-sen was the first to propose the ideal of establishing a bourgeois republic. This program reflected the awakening of the Chinese nation and attracted a large number of people to the banner of revolution.

    The Tongmenghui founded its own newspaper—"Min Bao." This publication is displayed in a glass cabinet. In the inaugural issue, Sun Yat-sen put forward the Three Principles of the People for the first time: "Nationalism," "Democracy," and "People's Livelihood." This marked a great development in Sun Yat-sen's political thought.

    A set of historical photos vividly illustrates the enormous work that Sun Yat-sen carried out in the short six years from the establishment of the Tongmenghui to the Wuchang Uprising of the Xinhai Revolution. He traveled at home and abroad. The Tongmenghui under his leadership, on the one hand, launched an ideological debate against the reformism of the constitutional monarchists, and on the other hand, continuously launched armed uprisings in the southern and Yangtze River basin provinces of China. The Guangzhou Uprising was the most famous of these uprisings. Seventy-two outstanding members of the Tongmenghui heroically sacrificed their lives in this struggle. The exhibition displays the portraits of martyrs such as Li Wenfu, Lin Shishuang, Lin Juemin, and Chen Wenbao among them. These uprisings all failed. The pioneers shed their blood and sacrificed their lives, and their revolutionary spirit of selfless dedication shocked the world, horrified the Qing government, and greatly inspired the anti-Qing revolutionary sentiments of the people across the country.

    "The revolutionary army's encampment outside Wuchang City," "The revolutionary army bravely crossing the river," "The fierce battle of Hankou"... A series of pictures led us into the glorious October of 1911. The Xinhai Revolution achieved a victory of great historical significance. Sun Yat-sen was the organizer and leader of this revolution.

    After the failure of the Xinhai Revolution, Sun Yat-sen fearlessly began a new arduous struggle to save the democratic republic. However, in the struggle against the Northern Warlords, he suffered repeated setbacks. He constantly learned lessons from failures. At the same time, he also felt confused because he had not found a way to lead the revolution to victory—where was China's way out?

    At this time, human history and the Chinese people's revolution began its dawn. Sun Yat-sen met the October Revolution and the Communist Party of China in despair. From then on, Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary thought and revolutionary cause entered the most glorious period of his life.

    The October Socialist Revolution was victorious. Sun Yat-sen cheered, "A great hope has been born for the people of the world." He sent a telegram to Lenin through overseas Chinese in the Americas to express his heartfelt yearning.

    The May Fourth Movement rose up, and Mr. Sun Yat-sen enthusiastically praised, "This new cultural movement is indeed an unprecedented great change in the ideological circles of our country today... If it can continue to grow, its future benefits will undoubtedly be great and long-lasting."

    The Chinese working class stepped onto the political stage, and the Communist Party of China was born. Sun Yat-sen sincerely welcomed the Communist Party of China. He recognized that the Communist Party of China was a new and huge revolutionary force and resolutely advocated cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. As a result, new figures, new atmosphere, and new forms of struggle appeared in the revolutionary ranks.

    Sun Yat-sen and Lenin never met. The rich historical materials displayed at the exhibition let us see the touching friendship between these two great revolutionaries, and the initial fraternal friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union that began with Sun Yat-sen and Lenin.

    Lenin respected Sun Yat-sen very much. He carefully studied the revolutionary program drafted by Sun Yat-sen and gave a very high evaluation to the revolutionary part of the program. Lenin successively sent many comrades to help the Chinese revolution. Sun Yat-sen even more admired Lenin, calling him "a saint in the revolution." Through personal experience and a clear comparison, Sun Yat-sen realized that "the French and American republics are all old-fashioned, and only Russia today is new-fashioned." From then on, he resolutely abandoned the illusions of European and American bourgeois republics. In a will to Chiang Kai-shek displayed in the glass cabinet, we saw Sun Yat-sen instructing categorically: "If our party wants to succeed in future revolutions, it can only take Russia as its teacher." In 1922, direct contact was established between Lenin and Sun Yat-sen, and the two outstanding revolutionary leaders joined hands in the struggle for human freedom and progress through correspondence.

    When the news of Lenin's death reached China, Sun Yat-sen was presiding over the First National Congress of the Kuomintang of China in Guangzhou. With extremely sad feelings, he immediately announced a three-day adjournment of the congress and ordered the national flag to be flown at half-mast nationwide. He personally inscribed the elegy "National Friend and Teacher." The photo of the memorial service for Lenin is displayed here. Sun Yat-sen stood on a white carpet, and all government officials stood silently behind him in mourning. In his eulogy, Sun Yat-sen said: "You have shown us the way to common struggle, and I am willing to follow your path. Although my enemies will oppose me, my people will respect me for it."

    In order to realize the revolutionary ideal he had struggled for all his life, Sun Yat-sen, with the help of the Soviet Union and the Communist Party of China, reorganized the Kuomintang he founded into an alliance of all revolutionary classes. He assigned communists to important positions in the party, government, and military. A photograph recorded the scene of Sun Yat-sen and Li Dazhao walking out of the venue during the First National Congress of the Kuomintang. The names of comrades Mao Zedong, Lin Boqu, and Qu Qiubai and others were on the list of alternate members of the Central Executive Committee handwritten by Sun Yat-sen. At this meeting, Sun Yat-sen put forward the three major policies of alliance with the Soviet Union, alliance with the Communist Party, and assistance to the peasant and worker movements, and on this basis, he reinterpreted the Three Principles of the People.

    The Kuomintang and the Communist Party formed the first revolutionary alliance against imperialism and feudalism. The Chinese revolution has since gained vigorous development. Sun Yat-sen also got rid of the difficult situation after the failure of the Xinhai Revolution, and his revolutionary activities entered a new era.

    On March 12, 1925, Sun Yat-sen passed away at his fighting post.

    The great pioneer of the democratic revolution—Sun Yat-sen, constantly absorbed the most advanced ideas of the era throughout his life. In every revolutionary stage he personally experienced, he always stood on the progressive side. He was self-reliant and constantly pursued self-renewal. When there were tremendous changes in the world and the turning point of the Chinese revolution, Sun Yat-sen also completed the greatest transformation of his life. Thirty-one years ago, he left us. However, his career, his great achievements in the Chinese people's revolution, will be forever recorded in history. His name, his revolutionary spirit, will always be respected by all Chinese people and by the oppressed people all over the world.

    伟大的人，不朽的事业！
    本报记者　林钢
    “孙中山先生生平事迹展览会”在北京中山公园中山堂举行。毛泽东主席亲自为这个展览会题了门额。走进中山堂高敞的木结构大殿，迎面便是中山先生的石膏塑像。
    一个巨人站立在我们面前。他为祖国的独立自由，献出了自己的全部生命。他是大勇者。在四十年的革命斗争中，曾经遭遇到无数次的困难和失败，然而他一往直前，始终挺起胸膛，高举着爱国主义的、反帝反封建的旗帜，走完了他光辉的生命的道路。
    中山堂正面屏风上，是用金字制成的毛主席的语录。我们亲爱的领袖，对于这位伟大的革命先行者，给予了极其崇高的评价。
    展览会上陈列的主要是照片，此外还有一部分历史文物：先生手书的“建国大纲”和其他墨迹手稿，他的遗著……。照片是按编年次序排列的。我们好像是在读着一部中山先生画传。
    翠亨村，我国南方的一个和平村庄，山明水秀。它诞生了并且养育了孙中山。中山先生生长在太平天国革命运动的高潮刚刚过去的时代，从小爱听洪杨故事，从童年时代起，在这个农民的儿子的心里就播下了革命的种子。
    他的最初的政治主张发表在九千余言的“上李鸿章书”里面，反映了他早年曾受到改良主义思想的深刻影响。甲午战争把中国沦为殖民地的危机深刻显露出来，而清朝政府却日趋昏庸腐朽。现实惊醒了这位目光锐利的青年志士。他很快得出结论，和平改良的方法是无望的，只有革命是唯一的出路。1894年，孙中山出走檀香山，创立了中国最早的资产阶级革命团体——兴中会。在丧权辱国的马关条约签订的几个月后，他在广州领导了第一次武装起义。这次起义因为事机不密失败，孙中山流亡海外。这位青年革命家一路鼓吹革命，四处征集同志。他成了公认的革命领袖。
    在二十世纪的最初几年，有组织的革命活动和自发的农民暴动蜂起。孙中山认清，要推翻清朝统治，必须把这些处在分散状态的革命力量集中起来，组织起来。于是，在1905年，孙中山在日本联合来自国内十七省的革命分子，成立了中国同盟会。他被推为总理。
    在“中国同盟会宣言”中，孙中山提出了“驱逐鞑虏，恢复中华，建立民国，平均地权”的革命民主主义的纲领。在中国历史上，孙中山是第一个提出建立资产阶级共和国理想的人。这个纲领反映了中国民族的觉醒，它把人民群众大量地吸引到了革命的旗帜下面。
    同盟会创刊了自己的机关报——“民报”。玻璃柜内陈列着这份刊物。孙中山在发刊词里第一次提出了“民族”“民权”“民生”的三大主义。这标志着孙中山政治思想的巨大发展。
    有一组历史照片具体生动地说明了，从同盟会成立，到辛亥革命起事的短短六年间，孙中山展开了多么巨大的工作。他奔走在国内海外。他领导下的同盟会，一面展开反对君主立宪派的改良主义的思想论战，一面在中国南方和长江流域各省连续发动武装起义。广州起义是最有名的一次起义。七十二位同盟会的优秀分子在这次斗争中壮烈牺牲了。展览会上陈列着他们之中的李文甫、林时爽、林觉民、陈文褒等烈士的遗像。这些起义都失败了。先驱者们抛头颅，洒鲜血，杀身成仁，前仆后继的革命精神，震动了世界，惊骇了清廷，大大地振奋了全国人民的反清革命情绪。
    “武昌城外革命军的野营”“革命军奋渡江”“汉口激战”……一系列图片把我们引进了1911年的光荣的十月。辛亥革命取得了具有伟大历史意义的胜利。孙中山是这次革命的组织者和领导者。
    辛亥革命失败以后，孙中山无畏地开始了新的艰苦的斗争来挽救民主共和国。然而，在反对北洋军阀的斗争中，他连续遭到挫败。他不断地从失败中吸取教训。同时他也因为没有找到引导革命走向胜利的道路而感到彷徨——中国的出路在那里呢？
    就在这个时候，人类历史和中国人民革命开始了它的黎明期。孙中山在绝望里遇到了十月革命和中国共产党。从此，孙中山的革命思想和革命事业进入了他一生中最光辉的时期。
    十月社会主义革命胜利了。孙中山欢呼“世界人类便生出了一个大希望”。他通过美洲华侨，发电向列宁祝贺，表示由衷的向往。
    五四运动起来了，中山先生热情地歌颂“此种新文化运动，在我国今日，诚思想界空前之大变动。……倘能继长增高，其将来收效之伟大且久远者，可无疑也。”
    中国工人阶级走上政治舞台，中国共产党诞生了。孙中山真诚地欢迎中国共产党。他认定中国共产党是一个新生的、巨大的革命力量，坚决倡导国共合作。于是，革命队伍里出现了新的人物，新的空气，新的斗争形式。
    孙中山和列宁没有见过面。展览会上陈列的丰富的史料，让我们看到了这两位革命伟人的动人的友谊，看到了由孙中山和列宁开始的中苏两国人民之间的最初的兄弟友谊。
    列宁很尊敬孙中山。他曾经仔细地研究孙中山手拟的革命纲领，并且对于纲领中的革命部分给以极高的评价。列宁先后派了许多同志来帮助中国革命。孙中山更十分崇敬列宁，他把列宁称为“革命中的圣人”。孙中山经过亲身体验和鲜明的对比，认识了“法美共和国皆旧式的，今天惟有俄国是新式的”。从此毅然抛弃了欧美资产阶级共和国的幻想。陈列在玻璃柜中一封给蒋介石的遗书中，我们看到孙中山斩钉截铁地教导说：“我党今后之革命，非以俄为师，断无成就。”在1922年，列宁与孙中山之间建立了直接的联系，两位杰出的革命伟人，通过函电来往，在争取人类自由和进步的斗争中携起了手来。
    列宁逝世的消息传到中国的时候，孙中山正在广州主持中国国民党第一次全国代表大会。他用极为哀痛的心情立即宣布大会休会三天，命令全国下半旗志哀。他亲手题了“国友人师”的挽额。这里陈列着追悼列宁大会的照片。孙中山站在一块白色地毯上，所有政府官员都在后面静默致哀。孙中山在悼词中说：“你给我们指出了共同斗争的道路，我愿意走着你的路。虽然我的敌人要反对我，但我的人民将因此而尊敬我。”
    为了实现他毕生为之奋斗的革命理想，孙中山接受苏联和中国共产党的帮助，把它手创的国民党改组成为各革命阶级的联盟。他把共产党人分派在党政军各个方面担任重要工作。有一张照片记录了国民党第一次全国代表大会期间孙中山和李大钊步出会场的情景。孙中山手写的中央候补执行委员的名单上有毛泽东、林伯渠、瞿秋白等同志的名字。在这次会上，孙中山提出了联合苏联，联合共产党，扶助农民运动和工人运动的三大政策，并且在这个基础上重新解释了三民主义。
    国民党和共产党第一次结成了反帝反封建的革命联盟。中国革命从此获得了蓬勃发展。孙中山也摆脱了辛亥革命失败以后的困难境地，他的革命活动进入一个崭新的时期。
    1925年3月12日，孙中山逝世在战斗的岗位上。
    伟大的民主主义革命的先驱者——孙中山，在他的一生中不断地吸取着时代的最先进的思想。在他亲身经历的各个革命阶段中，他总是站在进步方面。他自强不息，不断追求自我革新。当着世界发生巨大转变和中国革命的转折时期，孙中山也完成了自己一生中最伟大的转变。三十一年前，他离开了我们。然而他的事业，他对中国人民革命的丰功伟绩，将永垂史册。他的名字，他的革命精神，将永远受到全体中国人民的崇敬，受到全世界被压迫人民的崇敬。
