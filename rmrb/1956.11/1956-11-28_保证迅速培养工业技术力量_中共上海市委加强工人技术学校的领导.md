Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 26th. To strengthen leadership over workers' technical schools, the CCP Shanghai Municipal Committee and relevant departments have recently adopted various measures. The CCP Shanghai Municipal Committee has decided to establish a special body under the Municipal Party Committee's Heavy Industry Department to uniformly lead the Party work of all technical schools in the city. The Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League has transferred a group of full-time cadres to form a Technical Education Section to guide the League's work in various technical schools. The structure of the Workers' Technical School Management Office of the Shanghai Municipal Labor Bureau has also been adjusted, and a new Teaching Method Research Office has been established. First, six research groups, including those for lathe operators and drafting, will be set up to allow technical school teachers to discuss and study existing problems in teaching in order to improve teaching quality.

Shanghai currently has fifteen regular workers' technical schools with more than 8,200 students, offering thirty-two specialized trades. These schools can train 5,000 skilled technical workers for the country each year. From 1951 to June of this year, more than 18,000 students have graduated from here. They are distributed throughout the country, and many are now serving as work section chiefs, enterprise management cadres, and labor models or advanced production workers.

However, there are still many problems in Shanghai's technical schools. For a long time, the administrative side of the schools has neglected political work, often replacing education with administrative management methods and formulating many unrealistic systems. Students have shown disregard for rules, a loose and undisciplined lifestyle, and contempt for manual labor. According to the general situation, studying in a worker's technical school for a year and a half and then interning in a factory for half a year can achieve the skill level of a fourth-grade technician, but many students are now unable to meet this requirement.

    保证迅速培养工业技术力量
    中共上海市委加强工人技术学校的领导
    新华社上海26日电　中共上海市委员会和有关主管部门为了加强对工人技术学校的领导，最近采取了各种措施。中共上海市委员会决定在市委重工业部下面设立一个专门机构，统一领导全市技工学校的党的工作。青年团上海市委员会抽调一批专职干部成立了技术教育科，指导各技工学校的团的工作。上海市劳动局工人技术学校管理处的机构也作了调整，新建了一个教学方法研究室，首先设立车工、制图等六个研究组，让技工学校教师在这里讨论研究教学中存在的问题，以提高教学质量。
    上海现有正规的工人技术学校十五所，有八千二百多名学员，设有三十二个专业工种，每年可以为国家培养五千名熟练技术工人。1951年到今年6月，从这里毕业的学生有一万八千多人，他们分布在全国各地，许多人现在当了工段长、企业管理干部和劳动模范或先进生产工作者。
    但是，目前上海各技工学校还存在许多问题。长期以来学校行政方面忽视政治工作，常常用行政管理办法代替教育，订了许多不切实际的制度。学生中出现了无视制度，生活自由散漫和轻视体力劳动的现象。根据一般情况，在工人技术学校学习一年半，下厂实习半年，可以达到四级技工的熟练程度，但是现在有很多学生达不到这个要求。
