Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, November 14th: The tenth session of the Polish Parliament concluded its discussion of the draft Five-Year Plan on the 13th. Approximately sixty people spoke during the discussion of this draft. The session unanimously passed a resolution regarding the Five-Year Plan (1956-1960).

    The meeting that day studied the proposal for government reorganization put forward by Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Cyrankiewicz. In his proposal, Cyrankiewicz pointed out that Rokossovsky had requested to resign from his positions as Vice-Chairman of the Council of Ministers and Minister of National Defense. Cyrankiewicz suggested accepting his resignation and appointing Spychalski as Minister of National Defense, and appointing Zarzycki as Deputy Minister of National Defense. Cyrankiewicz also suggested appointing Bienkowski as Minister of Education, Baranski as Minister of Health, and Darski as Minister of Shipping. The Parliament unanimously passed this reorganization proposal.

    In addition, the meeting also passed the motion proposed by Speaker of the Parliament, Dąbrowski, regarding the reorganization of the State Council. Due to the resignation of Vice-Chairmen of the State Council, Ignar and Baczkowski, the Parliament appointed Wicek and Kulczyński as Vice-Chairmen of the State Council. Furthermore, the meeting also removed Kłosewicz and Kowalski from their positions as members of the State Council, and appointed Podejdworny as a member of the State Council.

    The meeting also passed resolutions to abolish the Committee of Public Security and to merge the Ministry of State Farms and the Ministry of Agriculture into the Ministry of Agriculture.

    Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, November 13th: According to a report by the Polish Press Agency, the plenary session of the tenth session of the Polish Parliament continued on the 12th.

    The parliament continued to discuss the Five-Year Plan bill. The first speaker was Wies, a member of parliament from the Cieszyn Province, who spoke about the problems in the petroleum industry. He said that Poland's demand for petroleum products is growing rapidly. In 1950, domestically refined oil could meet 24% of domestic market demand, while in 1955 it could only meet 11%. According to the draft plan, by 1960 it will only be able to meet 5% of domestic demand.

    Member of Parliament Szczoba spoke about the development of local industry, consumer goods industry, and building materials industry. She pointed out that there had been considerable neglect in this area, and requested that more funds be used to expand these industries in the Five-Year Plan.

    Speaking about the development of the textile industry in the Five-Year Plan, Urbańczyk pointed out that the guiding principles of the draft plan stipulated that this industry would grow by 18%, which was a good sign, but this should not lead to continued inferiority in the quality of these products.

    波议会通过五年计划的决定
    并批准改组政府和国务委员会的建议
    新华社华沙14日电　波兰议会第十次会议13日结束了对五年计划草案的讨论。在讨论这个草案时发言的约有六十人。会议一致通过了一个关于五年计划（1956—1960年）的决定。
    这一天的会议研究了部长会议主席西伦凯维兹所提出的政府改组的建议。西伦凯维兹在建议中指出，罗科索夫斯基请求辞去部长会议副主席和国防部长的职务。西伦凯维兹建议接受他的辞职请求，并且任命斯彼哈尔斯基为国防部长，任命萨热茨基为国防部副部长。西伦凯维兹还建议，任命宾科夫斯基为教育部长，巴朗斯基为卫生部长，达尔斯基为航运部长。议会一致通过了这项改组的建议。
    另外，会议还通过了议会议长邓博夫斯基提出的关于国务委员会改组的动议。由于国务委员会副主席伊格纳尔和巴齐科夫斯基辞职，议会任命维策赫和库尔钦斯基为国务委员会副主席。另外，会议还解除了克沃谢维奇和科瓦尔斯基的国务委员会委员的职务，任命波戴德沃尔尼为国务委员会委员。
    会议还通过了撤销公安委员会以及把国营农场部和农业部合并为农业部的决定。
    新华社华沙13日电　据波兰通讯社报道，波兰议会第十次会议的全体会议12日继续举行。
    议会继续讨论五年计划法案。第一个发言的是彻索夫省议员维斯，他谈到了石油工业中的问题。他说，波兰对石油产品的需求在迅速地增长。在1950年，国内提炼的石油能够满足国内市场的需求的24％，而在1955年，它只能满足11％。根据计划草案规定，到1960年它将只能满足国内需求的5％。
    议员什乔巴谈到了地方工业、消费品工业和建筑材料工业的发展。她指出，在这个方面有相当大的疏忽，并且要求在五年计划中有更多的资金用来扩大这些工业。
    乌尔班契克在谈到五年计划中发展纺织工业方面的问题时指出，计划草案的指导原则规定这种工业将增长18％，这是一个良好的迹象，但不应当因此而使这种产品的质量继续低劣。
