    What the Above Wants, the Below Creates
  　Zhou Jingyu
    Have you ever heard of advanced producers being "created"? If you spend a few minutes reading Comrade Ji Wan's article published in today's newspaper, you will learn how leaders with bureaucratic tendencies "create" advanced producers.
    This kind of thing is like a farce. In order to carry out the advanced producer movement, the China National Construction Corporation needed to find an advanced producer from among the painters. However, none of the leaders from top to bottom contacted the masses or understood the situation. The higher-ups, based solely on subjective impressions, rashly decided to have the lower levels compile Yang Xuanqi's advanced deeds. The lower levels then relayed this instruction level by level, setting a deadline for reporting. When the grassroots organization received this task, they mistakenly believed that the higher-ups knew the situation so clearly, and hastily assigned someone to compile materials, taking the opportunity to show off and cover up any suspicion of bureaucracy. The person compiling the materials, in order to cater to the leaders' intentions, did not hesitate to force connections and fabricate facts. In this way, an ideal advanced producer was "created."
    Originally, the emergence of advanced producers must have solid advanced deeds and be recognized by the masses. When selecting advanced producers, higher-level leading organs must implement the mass line, mobilize the masses to carefully evaluate, and use the advanced deeds of the masses to educate the masses, promote workers to learn advanced working methods, and improve labor productivity. This is an extremely detailed and serious task. Unfortunately, this serious work became very unserious in the hands of those suffering from bureaucratic illness. Usually, they neither contact the masses nor understand the situation below. When assigning tasks and demanding materials, they are as urgent as fire, setting deadlines for completion. However, after the materials are received, no one conducts careful research and review, and they simply copy and forward them, stamping them for approval. As a result, false reports and false materials smoothly pass through various levels and proceed unimpeded.
    Writing this, I can't help but think of a story about approving the distribution of a "wife." It is said that the administrative secretary-general of a certain agency always "approved" and "issued" all materials requested by subordinates without review. A prankster, intending to sound a warning, wrote many items on a requisition form, including a dozen pencils, five hundred sheets of manuscript paper, forty pairs of gloves, and also a "wife." Sure enough, the secretary-general still signed "approved." When the warehouse director took the approval form to the secretary-general to discuss how to issue the "wife," the secretary-general was greatly surprised. Although this story is different from the China National Construction Corporation's "creation" of an advanced producer, the bureaucratic copying and forwarding, without investigation and research, rash decisions, and stamping of approvals, are exactly the same.
    Such serious bureaucracy is, after all, very rare in our national life. However, improper and hasty selection of advanced producers is not an isolated case. Some unit leaders, in order to boast about the achievements of their unit, always believe that the more advanced producers the better, and the more ideal the achievements of advanced producers the better. Under the motivation of championism and a desire for great achievements and quick success, they often add embellishments and exaggerate achievements, turning collective achievements into individual ones, turning projections into reality, and turning immature things into successful creations. Some units easily decide that so-and-so is an advanced producer without extensive mass evaluation, and some units simply do not conduct mass selection, but are appointed or commissioned by the leadership. Higher-level leading organs, on the other hand, are high above, do not conduct investigation and research, lightly believe the reports from below, and perfunctorily approve them. As a result, not only does this fail to promote work, but it also damages the development of the advanced producer movement and creates a very bad influence among the masses.
    Who is ultimately responsible for such things? Of course, the leaders of certain grassroots units have impure motives and are eager for great achievements and quick success, and are certainly responsible. However, if higher-level leaders pay attention to investigation and research work at all levels and adhere to the mass line, then even if the motives of lower-level personnel are impure and they engage in fraud, it will never lead to falsehood becoming truth. Yang Xuanqi, a painter from the China National Construction Corporation, went from being an ordinary worker to an advanced producer, a youth shock worker, and a delegate to the Party Congress twice. However, the construction site Party branch did not conduct research and review, nor did the company and the general bureau conduct research and review, and even the Party Congress did not conduct research and review. Isn't this situation just the fault of the grassroots unit? Doesn't this situation prove that Yang Xuanqi, this advanced producer, is a "collective creation" of people with bureaucratic tendencies from top to bottom?
    Everyone should learn the necessary lessons from this incident in order to improve their work. However, judging from their mutual squabbling, leaders from top to bottom seem to want to be responsible, and everyone is shirking responsibility. They each put on a pair of tinted glasses, and can't see their own faces clearly. How can this attitude overcome bureaucracy?

    上面要，下面造
  　周静宇
    你听说过先进生产者可以“创造”出来吗？你如果花几分钟的时间看一看今天本报刊登的季万同志的文章，就会知道有官僚主义毛病的领导人员怎样“创造”出先进生产者的事情。
    这种事情，仿佛是一场滑稽剧。中南工程总局为了开展先进生产者运动，需要从油漆工里物色一个先进生产者，可是从上到下的领导人员，谁都不联系群众，谁都不了解情况，上级仅仅凭着主观印象，就贸然作出决定要下面整理出杨宣起的先进事迹；下级就层层照转，限期上报；基层组织接到这个任务的时候，误认为上级如此清楚地了解情况，就匆忙地指派专人整理材料，乘机炫耀一番，掩饰官僚主义的嫌疑。整理材料的人为了迎合领导人员的意图，就不惜牵强附会，弄虚作假。这样，一个理想的先进生产者就被“创造”出来了。
    本来，先进生产者的出现，必须具有确凿的先进事迹，并且为群众所公认，上级领导机关在评选先进生产者的时候，一定要贯彻群众路线，发动群众认真评选，用群众中的先进事迹教育群众，推动职工群众学习先进工作方法，提高劳动生产率。这是一件极其细致而又严肃的工作。很可惜，这样一件严肃的工作到了害官僚主义病的病人手里就变成了很不严肃的事情。平时，他们既不联系群众，也不了解下情，在布置任务，催索材料的时候，就急如星火，限期完成。但是，材料到手之后，谁也不去进行认真的研究和审查，即照抄照转，盖章同意。以致下面的假报告、假材料，顺利地通过种种关口，畅行无阻。
    写到这里，不禁使我想起一件批领老婆的故事。据说某机关的行政秘书长，一向对于下面领取物资，一律“照准”“照发”，不加审核。有一个恶作剧的人打算给他敲起警钟，在一张领物单上写了许多项目，其中有铅笔一打，稿纸五百张、手套四十双，还有老婆一名。果然，这位秘书长仍然签名“照发”。等到仓库主任拿了批准单找到秘书长商谈如何批领老婆的事情，这位秘书长才大吃一惊。这个故事虽然同中南工程总局“创造”先进生产者的事情有所不同，而官僚主义的照抄照转，不加调查研究，轻率决定，盖章同意，却是完全一样的。
    这样严重的官僚主义在我们的国家生活里毕竟是极少的。然而，对先进生产者的评选不当，草率从事，却不是个别的。有些单位的领导人员为了夸耀本单位的成绩，总以为先进生产者越多越好，先进生产者的成绩越理想越好，他们在锦标主义、好大喜功的动机下，常常加油添醋，夸大成绩，把集体的说成个人的，把预计的说成现实的，把不成熟的东西说成成功的创造。有的单位不经过广泛的群众评议，就轻易决定某某为先进生产者，有的单位干脆不经过群众评选，而由领导方面指派或委派。而上级领导机关则高高在上，不做调查研究，轻信下面报告，马马虎虎，审批通过。结果，不仅没有推动工作，反而破坏了先进生产者运动的开展，在群众中造成极坏的影响。
    像这样的事情究竟由谁负责呢？当然，某些基层单位的领导人员动机不纯，好大喜功，固然负有责任，如果上级领导人员层层注意调查研究工作，坚持群众路线，那末，纵使下级人员的动机不纯，弄虚作假，决不致于弄假成真。中南工程总局油漆工人杨宣起，由普通工人变为先进生产者、青年突击手、以及两次当了党代表，而工地党支部不加研究和审查，公司和总局也不加研究和审查，甚至连党代表大会也没有人进行研究和审查。这种情况，难道仅仅是基层单位的过错吗？这种情况，不正是证明了杨宣起这个先进生产者是从上到下有官僚主义毛病的人们的“集体创造”吗？
    谁都应该从这件事情中接受应有的教训，以便改进工作。然而从他们互相争吵的情况看来，从上到下的领导人员似乎谁都要负责，谁都在推托责任。他们一个个戴上了一副有色眼镜，始终看不清自己的面貌，试问这种态度又怎能克服官僚主义呢？
