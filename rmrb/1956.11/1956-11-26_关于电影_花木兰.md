    About the Movie "Hua Mulan"
    Chen Mengjia
    After seeing the Henan Yu Opera Troupe led by Chang Xiangyu perform "The Matchmaker" and "Hua Mulan" on the Beijing stage several times, I thought that they should be made into movies. I thought "The Matchmaker" should be filmed first, and it would be easier to make well. However, the film recently produced in Northeast China is "Hua Mulan". One Sunday afternoon, we squeezed into the "Toad Palace" cinema to watch it. From beginning to end, all around us, the sounds of "tsk" "tsk" admiration were incessant, praising Chang Xiangyu's exquisite acting skills and loud singing voice. As far as Chang Xiangyu herself is concerned, she is successful on the screen, and she is better able to give people a relaxed opportunity to appreciate her than other local operas that have been made into films. Her lyrics are more clearly and accurately imprinted on people's eardrums in the movie, clearer than hearing them in the theater, and more real than hearing them on records or broadcasts.
    But the flaw in the jade is the scenery and furnishings in the film, which are a big problem. Those unrealistic "mountains," especially the scenery of the battle scene, are too bad, and the actors are almost always hindered in their comings and goings. My old eyes seemed to see the large checkered cement floor of the studio. Those tents are also very unpleasant. They are much worse than the scenery and furnishings of "The Heavenly Match". If those who make movies can study these technical problems carefully in advance and absorb the advantages of other costume documentaries and stage scenery of other dramas, they should be able to do better. Obviously, the producers of this film did not handle these issues very carefully, or it can be said that the film director did not have the idea of ​​adapting the film techniques to the characteristics of local opera. Although the movie "Hua Mulan" has so many problems in production, in the scene we watched, all the audience ignored the unreasonable scenery and unanimously made the uncommonly heard admiring "tsk" "tsk" sound, then it should be credited to Chang Xiangyu and the performances of all the actors, which covered up these shortcomings.
    This documentary has shortcomings in photographic processing, but as a stage documentary, it is still worth watching. I think that, apart from Mr. Mei Lanfang's works, the performance and singing of this documentary are up to the level of world opera. Chang Xiangyu's innate singing voice extraordinarily calmly and measuredly manipulates the wide range, reaching the point of perfection, which is truly amazing. Because of this, we look forward to filmmakers creatively producing local operas.
    Yu Wujia's review of this film was published in the "People's Daily" on October 7, believing that the film has a contradiction between the traditional symbolic artistic expression techniques and the realistic artistic expression techniques. He hopes to develop on the basis of tradition, that is, to make necessary processing on the style of heritage. I think this is right. The outdoor scenes of the movie "Hua Mulan" should preferably only have a background without three-dimensional mountains, then it would be more natural to use a horse whip as a horse. However, the realistic scenery of this film itself has unreal aspects, which makes people feel very uncomfortable. As for bringing a stage play to the screen, the problem is not only in the symbolic and realistic expression techniques, but in how to reconcile the different techniques and some obstacles that exist between stage performance and film performance.
    I personally strongly agree with making more good local operas into movies, so that more people can see our beautiful cultural heritage. I especially feel that in order to serve the largest number of workers, peasants and soldiers, the vigorous development of stage record films is urgently needed. There are many problems and difficulties in this, and everyone should discuss and find ways to make the local operas made into movies better than the performances on stage, at least not worse than them. Don't forget that some local operas with high artistic and educational value, although they have not received the attention they deserve in big cities like Beijing, should still be made into movies. I am referring to the "Luohan Coin" and "Women's Representative Zhang Guirong" performed by the Beijing Opera Troupe. The performance and singing of the lead actress Wei Xikui are most admirable. She sang the praise of women for Chairman Mao in Zhang Guirong's mouth, and that kind of true expression is the true voice of women who occupy half of the population; she sang in "Luohan Coin" about the mother's longing for her past and the freedom obtained by the second generation. These two modern operas should still be needed in rural areas and smaller cities, not to mention that they themselves are relatively perfect works of art. I hope that the gentlemen in the art world will bring forth the new and cherish the almost forgotten Kun Opera, and also cherish the newly sprouting Qu Opera. So that they can equally be on the screen and bloom with wonderful flowers.

    关于电影“花木兰”
    陈梦家
    常香玉所领导的河南豫剧团在北京舞台上演出了“红娘”和“花木兰”，我看了几回以后，赞美之余，也想到它们应该拍成电影。我以为“红娘”更应该先拍，而且容易拍好。但是最近在东北摄制成的电影片，却是“花木兰”。在一个星期日下午，我们挤在“蟾宫”电影院内观看。从头至尾，在我们的前后左右，为了赞赏常香玉的精美的演技，和嘹亮的歌喉，“啧”“啧”赞扬之声不绝。就常香玉一个人而说，她在银幕上是成功的，她较之其它摄成电影片的地方戏，更能够出色地给人从容欣赏的机会。她的唱词，在电影上更清晰更准确的印入人的耳鼓上，比之在剧院中听的更清切，比之在唱片上或广播中听的更真切。
    但是美中不足的是影片中的布景与摆设，大有问题。那些不真实的“山”，尤其是大战一幕的布景太糟了，演员们往来驰骋几乎处处受到障碍。我的老花眼仿佛看到摄影场大方格子的洋灰地。那些个帐篷也是很不顺眼的。它们较之“天仙配”的布景和摆设，差得多了。这些技术上的问题，摄制电影的人若能事先好好地研究一番，吸收别的古装记录片和其它剧种的舞台布景的长处，应该可以做得好些的。显然的，这张影片的摄制者，没有很慎重地处理这些问题，或者可以说电影导演还没有想法使电影手法去适应地方戏的特性。电影“花木兰”在摄制上尽管有这许多毛病，但是在我们所看的一场上，全体的观众无视那种不很合理的布景，异口同声发出不常听见的赞美的“啧”“啧”之声，那末还应该归功于常香玉及全体演员们的表演，把这些缺点遮盖过了。
    这部记录片在摄影处理上是有缺点的，但作为一部舞台记录片，还是很应该看的。我以为，除了梅兰芳先生的诸作外，这部记录片的表演和歌唱是够得上世界的歌剧的水平的。常香玉的天赋的歌喉，异乎寻常地从容而有节度地操纵了那宽阔的音域，做到炉火纯青的地步，真是值得惊奇的。惟其如此，所以我们更盼望电影工作者创造地把地方戏摄制出来。
    10月7日“人民日报”刊有余吾家对于此片的评介，以为这部电影存在着传统的象征的艺术表现手法和现实的艺术表现手法的矛盾，他希望在传统的基础上发展，也就是在遗产的风格上作必要的加工。我想这是对的。电影“花木兰”的野外景，最好是只要背景而无需立体的山，那末用马鞭当马，也就自然一些。但是，这部电影片的写实的布景，本身就有不真实之处，使人看了很不自在。至于舞台剧搬上银幕，其问题尚不仅仅在象征的与写实的表现手法，而在于如何调和舞台的表现与电影的表现之间所存在的不同手法和若干障碍。
    我个人十分赞成将好的地方戏多多拍成电影，如此可以使更多的人看到我们优美的文化遗产。我尤其觉得，为了服务于人数最多的工农兵大众，舞台记录电影之应大力发展，尤为急不容缓。这其间存在许多问题与困难，应该大家讨论设法，使拍成电影的地方戏比在舞台上演出的更出色更好，至少不比它坏。也不要忘记，有些艺术性和教育性很高的地方戏，虽然在大城市如北京不曾受到应受到的重视，但是还应该拍制电影。我指的是北京曲剧团所演的“罗汉钱”和“妇女代表张桂容”，主演者魏喜奎的表演与歌喉是最可赞美的。她在张桂容的口中唱出了妇女对于毛主席的歌颂，那种真情流露是占据一半人口的妇女的真实声音；她在“罗汉钱”中唱出了母亲对于第二代获得自由而追想自己过去的沉痛。这两个现代歌剧，对于农村和较小的城市，还应该是需要的，更何况它们本身是较完美的艺术作品。希望艺术界的先生们，推陈而且要出新，爱护那几乎被忘记的昆剧，也爱护那新生萌芽的曲剧。使它们同样地能登上银幕，开放奇花。
