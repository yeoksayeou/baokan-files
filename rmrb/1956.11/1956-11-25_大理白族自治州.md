    Dali Bai Autonomous Prefecture
    Qin Guangjun
    Traveling west for 800 li from Kunming along the滇缅 Highway (Yunnan-Burma Road), passing through the rolling mountains and rivers, one arrives at Xiaguan, the capital of the Dali Bai Autonomous Prefecture. During the days when camellias, azaleas, and rapeseed flowers are in full bloom, the people of the Dali Bai Autonomous Prefecture joyfully celebrate the establishment of their Bai Autonomous Prefecture.

    The Dali Bai Autonomous Prefecture includes fourteen counties and Xiaguan City: Dali, Eryuan, Dengchuan, Yunlong, Fengyi, Binchuan, Yongping, Jianchuan, Heqing, Weishan, Yangbi, Xiangyun, Midu, and Yongjian. In this vast area, nearly 1.6 million people of Bai, Yi, Lisu, Hui, Miao, Dai, Naxi and other ethnic groups reside. Among them, the Bai population numbers more than 520,000, accounting for over 30% of the total population, and they are mostly distributed in the area west of the Jinsha River, east of the Lancang River, and north of the Yunnan-Burma Road.

    Rich Products

    The Dali Bai Autonomous Prefecture is a rich and beautiful region. The climate here is mild, with most areas enjoying spring-like weather all year round, making it suitable for growing various crops. Rice and wheat grow here, as well as coarse grains, cotton, and sugarcane. Yang Guotai of Xiazhuang Village on the edge of Erhai Lake averages more than 700 jin of wheat per mu, with some yielding as much as 1,090 jin. Rapeseed from Xihu Township in Dengchuan also yields 540 jin, with an average of 370 jin per mu. Binchuan is a major cotton-producing area in Yunnan, with an average yield of more than 50 jin per mu this year. Subtropical crops such as coffee, kapok, sugarcane, and cinchona can also be grown in this area, as well as the unique soybean tree. The castor beans here are evergreen and grow as thick as trees. This area also has the most dairy cows in the province, especially Dengchuan County, where almost every agricultural cooperative has herds of dairy cows. Rushan (milk fan), rubing (milk cake), and rushao (cheese) can be bought everywhere. Deyuanshan in Dengchuan also produces a kind of "Quwei Grass," which, when eaten by cows, produces more milk with a better taste when made into rushan. Binchuan and Dali in the Bai Autonomous Prefecture are also fruit towns. The honey oranges and yellow oranges of Binchuan are no less delicious than the honey oranges and mandarin oranges from other places, and the Xue Li pears of Dali are much better than the delicious Ya Li pears of the north. Once transportation becomes convenient, these things can be sold throughout the country.

    Not only that, Dali, Fengyi, and Dengchuan, which are located on the edge of Erhai Lake, also abound in fish, especially bowfin, as well as the rare oily fish and Bingxue fish. Erhai Lake, this plateau lake, is dotted with fishing boats all year round, and the coastal residents can eat fresh fish all year round. Bai people often call beautiful and capable girls "girls from the bowfin family" and ridicule lazy men as "ugly carp."

    Charming Scenery

    The Dali Bai Autonomous Prefecture is a beautiful place. Here, there are beautiful scenes in all seasons. If you come here in winter, there are blooming camellias; azaleas bloom here at any time. If you come here in May or June, you can see the white snow of Cangshan Mountain and the golden wheat waves by Erhai Lake. At that time, Diequan (Butterfly Spring) at the foot of Dengchuan Mountain is a good place to visit. Tens of thousands of butterflies connect head to tail on several trees beside the spring, hanging down from the leaves. The clear water of Diequan flows out of the pond under the trees. If you come in July or August, you can watch the Yudaiyun (Jade Belt Clouds) hanging in the waist of Cangshan Mountain after the rain. This kind of white cloud is like a belt, more than a hundred li long, and lasts for a long time. If you come in September or October, Dali is really fragrant with osmanthus flowers for ten li. In September and October, in Eryuan County, you can watch the unique "Bird Hanging Mountain" with the Bai people. In the night when the dark clouds cover the deep sky, the Bai people light bonfires, making the sky appear with colorful clouds, various birds flock to it, and scatter at dawn. The ancient sites here are too numerous to mention. No matter when you come, you will always enjoy the charming scenery of this place. There is a legend here that "every family raises flowers and every household has running water." In the Dali Marble Cooperative in Dali County of the Bai Autonomous Prefecture, you can hear the sound of grinding marble day and night. All nineteen peaks of Cangshan Mountain produce marble. This marble, after being artificially ground, can become natural landscape paintings, and some even become bird and animal shapes, which are very moving. After liberation, with the help of the Party and the government, the Bai people actively developed it, and there has been a great improvement in technology, and the varieties have increased to more than 70 kinds. Before liberation, it was in a state of depression and dying, but now the supply falls short of demand.

    The Dali Bai Autonomous Prefecture is a place with culture. As early as the early Tang Dynasty, they established the Nanzhao Kingdom, which was the predecessor of the famous Dali Kingdom in later history. In the long years, the Bai people created a rich and colorful folk literature. The famous love story poem "Wangfu Yun" (Waiting-for-Husband Clouds) tells the story of the Nanzhao period, as well as "Meiren Shi" (Beauty Stone), "Shegu Ta" (Snake Bone Pagoda), and "The Origin of the March Street," which profoundly and vividly reflect the people's hatred of the ruling class and their pursuit of freedom and happiness. The Bai people are a nation that can sing and dance. Almost everywhere there are oral poems circulating. They have many lyrical verses, singing about their own labor life and love, and praising the Communist Party.

    Tradition of Struggle

    The people here, in order to pursue freedom and happiness, have carried out many large-scale struggles with the reactionary classes. In the Qing Dynasty, there was a struggle against the rulers led by the Hui people, including the Yi and Bai people. The people here have repeatedly established political alliances in history, repelling the aggression of foreign reactionary rulers. When the Red Army marched north to resist Japan and passed through Jianchuan County, they received help from the people here. Before liberation, under the leadership of the Party, the people here had carried out guerrilla warfare and underground struggles, and established the Northwest Yunnan People's Government. After liberation, under the leadership of the Communist Party, various democratic reforms were carried out, the landlord class was eliminated, and especially last winter and this spring, more than 90% of the people of all ethnic groups embarked on the broad road of agricultural cooperativization, which fundamentally changed the relationship between the people of all ethnic groups.

    In various struggles and reforms, the Party in the Dali area has trained more than 4,000 cadres from fraternal ethnic groups; including cadres from Bai, Hui, Yi, Miao, Naxi and other ethnic groups. In recent years, grassroots organizations of the Party and the Communist Youth League have been established in ethnic minority areas, and a large number of Party members and League members have been developed. They have played a great backbone role in various tasks.

    Happy Life

    The people of the Dali Bai Autonomous Prefecture, which has been cooperativized, are actively changing the poverty left over from history. They clearly realize that the plateau area lacks water. If they want to achieve a bumper harvest, they must build water conservancy. This year, under the leadership of the Party committee, they carried out various water conservancy projects, focusing on small-scale water conservancy and adapting to local conditions. This year, more than 18,000 new and renovated water conservancy projects have been completed in the district, which can irrigate more than 290,000 mu of farmland. As a result, agricultural cooperatives in many areas have eliminated drought and ensured that more than 90% of the members have increased their income. More than 30 agricultural cooperatives in Dali County, where the Bai people live, have achieved increased production for consecutive years. Of the 128 Bai households in Chengzhuang Village, only six families had enough to eat in the past. Now, not only the whole village has enough to eat, but also sells 150,000 jin of surplus grain.

    It can be predicted that after the implementation of national autonomy, the people here will surely better display their national characteristics, work more actively, and make their lives better. (Attached pictures)

    大理白族自治州
    秦军光
    从昆明沿着滇缅公路西行八百里，穿过那起伏的大山和河流，便到了大理白族自治州的首府下关。大理白族自治州的人民，在山茶花、杜鹃花、油菜花盛开的日子里，欢欣鼓舞地来庆祝他们白族自治州的成立。
    大理白族自治州包括大理、洱源、邓川、云龙、凤仪、宾川、永平、剑川、鹤庆、巍山、漾濞、祥云、弥渡、永建十四个县和下关市。在这个广大地区，居住着白、彝、傈僳、回、苗、傣、纳西等民族近一百六十万人口。其中白族人口计有五十二万多人，占总人口的30％以上，他们多分布于金沙江以西，澜沧江以东，滇缅路以北地区。
    富饶的物产
    大理白族自治州，是个富饶、美丽的地区。这里气候温和，大部地区四季如春，宜于生长各种农作物。这里生长稻谷和小麦，也出产杂粮和棉花、甘蔗。洱海边下庄杨国太的小麦每亩平均七百多斤；最高产量有的达一千零九十斤。邓川西湖乡的油菜籽也产到五百四十斤；平均每亩达三百七十斤。宾川是云南棉花主要产地，今年平均每亩产到五十多斤。在这个地区也可种植亚热带作物：咖啡、木棉、甘蔗、金鸡纳霜，还有奇特的黄豆树。这里的蓖麻由于四季长青，也长得像树样粗。这里的乳牛也是全省最多的地方，尤其是邓川县几乎每一个农业社都有成群的乳牛。乳扇、乳饼、乳酪随处都可买到。邓川的德源冈还产一种“蕖?草”，牛吃了以后牛乳特别多，制成乳扇味儿也好。白族自治州的宾川、大理还是水果之乡，宾川的蜜桔、黄果比外地的蜜桔和广柑都不逊色，大理的雪梨比北方的美味鸭梨要好得多。一旦交通方便了，这些东西都可行销全国。
    不仅如此，靠洱海边上的大理、凤仪、邓川，还盛产鱼类，特别是弓鱼，还有稀有的油鱼和丙穴鱼。洱海，这个高原上的海，整年整月的飘浮着渔船，沿海居民一年四季都能吃到鲜鱼。白族人民常把美丽能干的姑娘称为“弓鱼家的姑娘”，把不爱劳动的男子讥笑为“难看的鲤鱼”。
    迷人的风光
    大理白族自治州是个美丽的地方。在这里一年四季都有美丽的景物。如果你冬季来到这里，有盛开的茶花；这里杜鹃花是什么时候都有开放。如果你5、6月里来到这里，可以看到苍山的白雪和洱海边的金色的麦浪，在那时，邓川山下的蝶泉是个好游的地方，成千上万的蝴蝶在蝶泉边几棵树上，首尾相衔从树叶上垂下来，蝶泉清清地从树下的池塘里流出来。如果你在7、8月间来，可以在雨后观看悬在苍山腰间的玉带云，这种白云如带，长百多里，经久不散。如果你在9、10月间来，在大理真是风吹十里桂花香。在9、10月间，在洱源县你可和白族人民共同观看奇特的“鸟吊山”，在那阴云遮着深空的夜里，白族人们点起篝火，使空中出现彩霞般的色彩，各种鸟儿群翔而至，至天明始散。这里的古迹也述不胜述。不管你什么时候来，总会饱赏这个地方的迷人风光。在这里有“家家养花、户户流水”的传说。在白族自治州的大理县的大理石合作社里，你日日夜夜可以听见磨制大理石的响声。苍山十九峰，峰峰都出大理石。这种大理石经人工磨制后，可以成为自然的山水画，有的还成鸟兽形，非常动人。解放后在党和政府的帮助下，白族人民积极地加以开采，在技术上有了很大的提高，品种已增加到七十多种。解放前是萧条待毙，现在是供不应求。
    大理白族自治州是个有文化的地方，远在唐初他们就建立了南诏国，也就是后来历史上有名的大理国的前身。在悠久的岁月中，白族人民创造了丰富多彩的民间文学，有名的爱情故事诗“望夫云”，说的就是南诏时的故事，还有“美人石”、“蛇骨塔”和“三月街的来历”等，都深刻而生动地反映了人民对统治阶级的憎恨，对自由幸福的追求。白族人民是个能歌善舞的民族，几乎到处都有口头诗的流传，他们有很多抒情的诗句，歌唱他们自己的劳动生活和爱情，歌颂着共产党。
    斗争的传统
    这里的人民，他们为了追求自由和幸福，曾和反动阶级进行过多次大规模的斗争，在清代有以回族为首包括彝族、白族的反对统治者的斗争。这里的人民历史上曾多次建立过政治联盟，击退了异族反动统治的侵略。红军北上抗日经过这里的剑川县时，曾得到这里人民的帮助。解放前在党的领导下，这里的人民曾经进行过游击战争和地下斗争，并建立了滇西北人民政权。解放后，在共产党领导下，曾进行了各项民主改革，消灭了地主阶级，特别是去冬今春，90％以上的各族人民走上了农业合作化的康庄大道，使各族人民之间的关系起了根本的变化。
    在各项斗争和改革中，大理地区的党培养了兄弟民族的干部四千多人；其中包括白、回、彝、苗、纳西等民族的干部。近几年来，在兄弟民族地区建立了党和团的基层组织，发展了大批的党员和团员。他们在各项工作中起了很大的骨干作用。
    幸福的生活
    已经合作化了的大理白族自治州的人民，积极地改变着历史上遗留下的贫困生活，他们清楚地认识到高原地区缺水，如果要获得丰收，就要兴修水利。今年，他们在党委领导下，以小型水利为主，因地制宜地开展了多样的水利工程。今年全区新修和整修的水利工程一万八千多项，可增灌二十九万多亩田地。使得许多地区的农业社消灭了旱灾，保证了90％以上的社员增加了收入。白族聚居的大理县三十多个农业社连年获得增产。呈庄村的一百二十八户白族，过去够吃的只有六家，现在不仅全村够吃，并且还卖余粮十五万斤。
    可以预料，实行了民族自治以后，这里的人民定会更好地发挥他们的民族特长，更积极地劳动，把生活过得更美好。（附图片）
