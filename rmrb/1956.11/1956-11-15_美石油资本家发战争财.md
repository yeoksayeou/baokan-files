According to American industry sources, American oil companies are using tankers to transport oil from Venezuela and American ports to Western Europe via the Cape of Good Hope. He also said that, so far, the shipment of American and Caribbean oil to Europe has only just begun.

    美石油资本家发战争财
    新华社14日讯　纽约消息：美国的石油垄断集团正在利用英国、法国和以色列侵略埃及对西欧石油供应的影响而大发其财。据美国工业人士说，美国的各家石油公司正在用油船绕道好望角把委内瑞拉和美国各海港的石油运到西欧去。他还说：到现在为止，美国和加勒比海石油的运往欧洲还只是刚刚开始。但是，在可以获得更多的油船和定期轮船重新行驶的时候，装运量可望大大增加。
