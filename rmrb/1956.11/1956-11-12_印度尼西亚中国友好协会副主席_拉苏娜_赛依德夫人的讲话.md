The Preparatory Committee for the Commemoration of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Birthday invited us to attend this conference. We would like to express our sincere gratitude on behalf of the Indonesia-China Friendship Association.

Ninety years ago today, a great man was born, and he sowed seeds for the next generation. Fortunately, the next generation I am talking about is you.

I don’t think it is necessary for me to explain here Dr. Sun's contribution to the people and his role among the people.

Regarding the history of the awakening of Asia, anyone with a little common sense must know what an era full of darkness was. In that era, the Chinese people suffered spiritual and physical oppression from foreigners.

Dr. Sun was the first hero to endure all suffering in order to awaken his almost extinct nation.

Nor do I need to talk more about how deep Dr. Sun's love for the people was, and he even left a will of this love when he was about to say goodbye to us forever.

What I want to point out here is that when Dr. Sun Yat-sen was groping for a way to save the country and the people, he was also fighting to realize the ideals of the Indonesian people. You may remember that Brother Sukarno—our President—repeatedly mentioned Dr. Sun and his ideals in many of his speeches.

Now, it is easy to understand the sentence "We have a responsibility to awaken all oppressed nations." But in Dr. Sun's time, such words were not easily accepted, and even considered absurd.

Dr. Sun is great precisely because he was the first to establish this glorious ideal when most people were still unclear.

In Indonesia, after the people understood Dr. Sun's ideals, they believed that they should seek what they had lost.

I dare say that the awakening of the Indonesian people was inspired by Dr. Sun.

The Indonesian people's struggle has gone through its own path. The Chinese people's struggle has also gone through its own path.

Although the paths are different, the driving force is the same.

Therefore, it is my duty to come to China from Indonesia to participate in the Dr. Sun Yat-sen Commemorative Conference.

Finally, I express my highest respect to the great man we commemorate today.

Thank you!

    印度尼西亚中国友好协会副主席
    拉苏娜·赛依德夫人的讲话
    纪念孙逸仙博士诞辰筹备委员会邀请我们出席这次大会，我们谨代表印度尼西亚中国友好协会表示诚挚的谢意。
    九十年前的今天，一个伟大的人物诞生了，他为下一代播下种子。万分庆幸，这里所说的下一代就是你们。
    我以为我没有必要在这里说明孙博士给予人民的贡献和在人民中间的作用。
    关于亚洲觉醒的历史，只要有点常识的人一定知道什么是充满了黑暗的时代。在那个时代里，中国人民在心灵上和肉体上都遭受到外国人的欺凌。
    孙博士是第一个为了唤醒自己的几乎被灭亡的民族而忍受一切苦难的英雄。
    我也没有必要在这里多谈孙博士对于人民的爱是多么的深厚，一直到在他快要和我们永别的时候，还留下了这种爱的遗嘱。
    我要在这里指出的是，当孙逸仙博士在摸索中寻找救国救民的道路的时候，他也是为实现印度尼西亚人民的理想而奋斗。诸位也许还记得，苏加诺兄——我们的总统，在他的许多演讲里屡次提到孙博士及其理想。
    现在，很容易理解“我们有责任唤醒一切被压迫的民族”这句话。但是在孙博士那个时代，这样的话是不容易被接受的，甚至被认为是荒谬的。
    孙博士之所以伟大，正因为当大多数人还在模糊不清的时候，他首先确立了这种光辉的理想。
    在印度尼西亚，人民了解了孙博士的理想以后，认为他们应该寻找他们已失去的东西。
    我敢说印度尼西亚人民的觉悟是受到孙博士的启发的。
    印度尼西亚人民的斗争曾经历了自己的道路。中国人民的斗争也经历了自己的道路。
    虽然道路不同，但其动力是一致的。
    因此我从印度尼西亚来到中国参加孙博士纪念大会，这是我的责任。
    最后，我对我们今天纪念的伟大人物表示崇高的敬仰。
    谢谢！
