    Upper-Class Members of Yunnan's Border Minority Nationalities
    Are Properly Settled and Strive to Remold Themselves

    (Our dispatch) One thousand four hundred-plus upper-class figures from minority nationalities in Yunnan Province's border regions have been properly settled. In recent years, the Party and the government, in a planned and differentiated manner in the border regions, have placed the big "mountain officials," princes, upper-level Tusi (chieftains) and their officials, and tribal headmen from various minority nationalities in various levels of government departments, according to their different circumstances. Some have taken positions as members of the Provincial People's Political Consultative Conference, heads and deputy heads of prefectures and counties, and heads of districts; others have taken on cultural, educational, and translation work. Another four hundred and fifty upper-class figures from minority nationalities have entered nationality institutes to study. For some upper-class figures from minority nationalities who have genuine financial difficulties, the government has also provided special economic assistance. In addition, many small "mountain officials" and village headmen, after they gave up exploitation, have been provided with certain living allowances by the Party and the government based on their specific circumstances to help them transition to labor production and transform themselves into self-reliant individuals. The properly settled upper-class figures from minority nationalities are very satisfied with the Party and the government's arrangements and care for them, as well as the long-term policy of uniting the upper strata of the nationalities. They have stated that they will work diligently and strive to remold themselves under the leadership of the Party and the government.

    本报讯　云南省边疆地区一千四百多个民族上层人物，得到了妥善的安置。几年来，党和政府在边疆地区有计划有分别地将各少数民族中的大山官、王子、上层土司及其属官、部落头人等，根据他们不同的情况，分别地安置在国家各级政府部门，有的担任了省政协委员、正、副州长、正、副县长、区长；有的担任了文化、教育、翻译等工作。还有四百五十个民族上层人物进了民族学院学习。对于部分生活确有困难的民族上层人物，政府还给了经济上的特殊照顾。另外，还有不少小山官、村寨头人，在他们放弃剥削以后，党和政府根据他们的具体情况，发给了一定的生活补助费，帮助他们转入劳动生产，改造成为自食其力的人。被妥善安置了的民族上层人物，对于党、政府对他们的安置和照顾以及长期团结民族上层的政策颇为满意。他们表示要在党和政府领导下，好好工作，努力改造自己。
