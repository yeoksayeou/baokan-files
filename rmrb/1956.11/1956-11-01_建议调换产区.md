    Suggest Changing Production Areas
    Our Shanghai Building Materials Company, in order to meet the needs of basic construction in the Shanghai area, has purchased a large number of bricks and tiles from more than a dozen areas south of Hangzhou in Zhejiang Province, including Ningbo, Yuyao, Shaoxing, Jinhua, and Quzhou. However, the bricks and tiles needed for basic construction in the Hangzhou area are mostly purchased from the Jiaxing area of Zhejiang, near Shanghai. This year, the extra transportation costs incurred by this reciprocal transportation are more than 80,000 to 100,000 yuan.
    In order to correct this unreasonable phenomenon, we proposed to the relevant departments in Zhejiang in mid-July this year to exchange production areas. However, no effective measures have been taken to achieve this. We hope that the relevant units in Zhejiang will quickly resolve this issue. Gao Zhaojie

    建议调换产区
    我们上海市建筑材料公司，为了满足上海地区基本建设需要，曾在浙江省杭州以南的宁波、余姚、绍兴、金华、衢州等十多个地区收购了一大批砖瓦。而杭州地区的基本建设所需要的砖瓦，却大部分从上海附近的浙江嘉兴地区采购。今年这种相向运输所多支出的运输费用在八万到十万元以上。
    为了纠正这一不合理现象，今年7月中旬，我们曾提出和浙江有关部门调换产区的建议。但却一直没有采取有效措施加以实现。我们希望浙江有关单位迅速解决这一问题。　高肇节
