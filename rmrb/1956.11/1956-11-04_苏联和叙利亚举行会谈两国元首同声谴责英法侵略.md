Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 3rd: TASS reports: Soviet and Syrian representatives held talks on November 2nd in the Kremlin.

Attending the talks from the Soviet side were Voroshilov, Bulganin, Zhukov, and Shepilov.

Attending the talks from the Syrian side were President Kuwatly, Foreign Minister Bitar, and Defense Minister Reislan, among others.

During the talks, the two sides discussed pressing issues of mutual concern. The talks proceeded in a sincere and very friendly atmosphere.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 3rd: TASS reports: Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, Voroshilov, said at a banquet on November 1st in honor of Syrian President Kuwatly that the Soviet government firmly condemns the aggressive actions of the governments of Great Britain, France, and Israel against Egypt, and views such actions as a challenge to the people of all Arab countries and to the people of all countries struggling for peace and against colonialism.

Voroshilov said that recent developments have proven that the armed aggression against Egypt was instigated and pre-planned by the colonialists, because the colonialists are unwilling to allow the Arab people to handle their own fate and their own wealth according to their own wishes.

He concluded by saying that the Syrian people and the people of other countries in the East's struggle to eliminate the unfortunate consequences of colonial oppression, to develop their national economies, and to improve their living standards and cultural levels has always received a warm response and ardent sympathy from the Soviet working people. The people of all nationalities in the Soviet Union are deeply sympathetic to the just struggle of the Arab countries for national independence.

Kuwatly said in his reply that the Arab nation is now engaged in a great liberation struggle. The Arab nation hopes for complete freedom and hopes that the rights of all nations to exist will be respected. Eighty million Arabs share this belief.

The Arab people are completely united with the people of Asia and Africa, and they are fighting together for national independence and liberation. This movement of the Arab people has been resolutely resisted by the imperialists, who have allied themselves with Jewish nationalists, doing everything possible to obstruct the Arab people's progressive movement.

Kuwatly said that today we hear how imperialism, colluding with Jewish nationalism, has committed aggression against fraternal Egypt. We believe that aggression against Egypt is not just aggression against one country, we regard such aggression as aggression against the entire Arab world. We and the entire Arab people will stand shoulder to shoulder with fraternal Egypt to fight for its independence and sovereignty.

Kuwatly expressed his deep gratitude to the Soviet people for all the sympathy and friendship they have shown to the Arab and Egyptian people.

    苏联和叙利亚举行会谈两国元首同声谴责英法侵略
    新华社3日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联和叙利亚两国代表11月2日在克里姆林宫举行了会谈。
    苏联方面出席会谈的是伏罗希洛夫、布尔加宁、朱可夫、谢皮洛夫。
    叙利亚方面出席会谈的是总统库阿特利，外交部长比塔尔和国防部长雷斯兰等人。
    会谈中，双方讨论了他们共同关心的迫切问题。会谈始终是在诚恳和非常友好的气氛中进行的。
    新华社3日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席伏罗希洛夫11月1日在招待叙利亚总统库阿特利的宴会上说，苏联政府坚决指责英国、法国、以色列三国政府对埃及的侵略行动，并且把这种行动看成是对全体阿拉伯国家人民，对为和平、为反对殖民主义而奋斗的各国人民的挑战。
    伏罗希洛夫说，最近局势发展的情况证明，武装侵略埃及是殖民主义者所鼓动和事先策划好了的，因为殖民主义者不甘心让阿拉伯人民根据自己的意愿来处理自己的命运和自己的财富。
    他最后说，叙利亚人民和东方其他国家人民为消除殖民压迫的不幸后果、为发展民族经济和提高自己的生活水平和文化水平而进行的斗争始终得到苏联劳动人民的热烈反应和热切的同情。苏联各族人民都十分同情阿拉伯国家人民为争取民族独立而进行的正义斗争。
    库阿特利致答词说，阿拉伯民族现在正进行伟大的解放斗争。阿拉伯民族希望完全自由，希望各民族生存的权利得到尊重。八千万阿拉伯人都具有这种信念。
    阿拉伯人同亚非国家人民是完全团结一致的，他们共同为争取民族独立和解放而斗争。阿拉伯人民的这种运动遭到帝国主义者的坚决反抗，他们同犹太民族主义结成联盟，千方百计地阻挠阿拉伯人的进步运动。
    库阿特利说，今天我们听到，帝国主义如何同犹太民族主义串通一起，对兄弟埃及进行侵犯。我们认为，侵犯埃及不只是侵犯它一个国家，我们把这种侵犯看成是对整个阿拉伯的侵犯。我们和全体阿拉伯人民将同兄弟的埃及肩并肩地为它的独立和主权而斗争。
    库阿特利对苏联人民给予阿拉伯和埃及人民的一切同情和友谊表示了深切的感谢。
