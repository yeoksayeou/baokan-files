    Over fifty types of New Year pictures have been published by the People's Fine Arts Publishing House and the Morning Flower Publishing House, totaling 3,280,000 copies. The New Year pictures cover a wide range of subjects and are diverse in form.
    This year's newly published "Door Gods" are folk New Year pictures with a long history. They are titled "Abundant Harvest of Five Grains, Prosperity of Livestock," and the pictures depict children joyfully singing and dancing, surrounded by decorations of five grains and domestic animals. The author of "Agricultural Calendar Chart" adopted the form of pasting "Kitchen Gods" in rural areas, with a table of twenty-four solar terms on the picture. The New Year pictures composed of stills from the plays "Ten Thousand Waters and Thousand Mountains" and "The Goddess of Luo" are also the first attempts in the form of New Year pictures.
    There are more traditional Chinese paintings in the New Year pictures this year than in previous years. The works of famous Chinese painters Yu Feian and Liu Kuiling have been made into New Year pictures.

    五十多种新年画出版
    据新华社讯　题材广泛和形式多样的新年画，现已由人民美术出版社和朝花出版社出版了五十二种，共印刷了三百二十八万多份。
    今年新出版的“门画”，是富有悠久历史的民间年画，采用“五谷丰登、人畜两旺”为标题，画面上表现娃娃们欢乐歌舞的情景，周围装饰着五谷和家畜。“农历图”的作者采取农村中张贴“灶禡”的形式，画上有二十四个节气表。用剧照组成的年画“万水千山”和“洛神”等也是年画形式上的初次尝试。
    新年画中的国画比往年都多，著名的国画家于非暗、刘奎龄的作品制成了年画。
