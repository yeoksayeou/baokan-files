    "Pig Hospital"
    Tongxian Township, Anyue County, Sichuan Province, recently established a "pig hospital." The hospital building was converted from an old house. Kang Houkuan, a well-known local veterinarian, serves as the doctor, and two people were hired to specialize in feeding sick pigs and preparing and administering medicine. In addition to outpatient services, sick pigs can also be hospitalized for treatment, with feed and medicine costs borne by the pig farmers. The consultation fee for treating one pig is only 10 cents, in addition to the cost of medicine. In the past 24 days, 21 sick pigs have been cured. In the past, many farmers in this township were busy with farm work and did not have time to take care of their pigs when they became ill, nor could they find a veterinarian to treat them. Moreover, some farmers raised several pigs at home, making it difficult to isolate sick pigs. Now that there is a pig hospital, these problems have been solved.

### “猪医院”

    “猪医院”
    四川省安岳县通贤乡最近建立了一所“猪医院”。医院的院舍是用一处旧房屋改成的。由当地有名的兽医康厚宽作医师，并请了两个专门喂养病猪和调药喂药的人员。病猪除了门诊，还可以住院治疗，饲料和药费由养猪户负担。医一只猪除药费外只收诊费一角。在最近二十四天中，已医治好二十一只病猪。这个乡过去许多农民忙着农活，猪得了病也没有时间照料和请不到兽医医治，并且有的农民家中喂数只猪，对病猪难于隔离，现在有了猪医院，这些问题都解决了。
