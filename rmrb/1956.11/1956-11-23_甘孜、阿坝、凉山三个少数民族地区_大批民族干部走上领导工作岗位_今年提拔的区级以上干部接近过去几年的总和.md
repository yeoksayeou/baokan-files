Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 22nd – In Sichuan Province's Ganzi and Aba Tibetan Autonomous Prefectures and Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture, over 460 cadres from Tibetan, Yi, Qiang, and other ethnic groups have been promoted to leadership positions in district-level and higher-level government organs and mass organizations this year. This number approaches the total number of ethnic minority cadres promoted to district-level and above positions in the past few years.

In Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, ethnic minority cadres account for more than half of the members of the county Party committees in eight counties. In Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture, each of the twelve counties, except for three, has one or two Yi cadres serving as members of the county Party committees.

Currently, there are over 6,200 ethnic minority cadres in various departments of the autonomous prefectures. In the past, the vast majority of them were ordinary peasants, herdsmen, or working women. In recent years, they have studied ethnic policies, domestic and international current events, and their own ethnic cultural knowledge in numerous ethnic cadre schools and training classes specifically established for them by the Party and the People's Government. After graduation, they have received assistance from Han cadres in their work, and their work abilities have improved rapidly. Zeng Que Zha (Tibetan), who worked as a leather shoe maker in Batang County of Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture before liberation, is now a member of the prefectural Party committee and deputy head of the Tibetan People's Organization. Angweng Cielie (Tibetan), deputy county head of Daofu County in Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Xiang Xiuzhen (Tibetan, female), deputy manager of the trade company, and Chen Zongbin (Qiang), deputy county head of Wenchuan County in Aba Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, were all illiterate peasants in the past.

At a recent ethnic work conference, the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party requested that the Party organizations in the above-mentioned autonomous prefectures universally conduct another round of education to oppose Great Han Chauvinism. The work of cultivating ethnic minority cadres should be regarded as one of the main criteria for evaluating the quality of work of Party committees at all levels and every Han cadre, especially leading cadres. For the leading backbone cadres among ethnic minority cadres, a considerable number of Han leading cadres should be assigned to assist them, and active measures should be taken to improve the policy, professional, and cultural levels of ethnic minority cadres.

    甘孜、阿坝、凉山三个少数民族地区
    大批民族干部走上领导工作岗位
    今年提拔的区级以上干部接近过去几年的总和
    新华社成都22日电　四川省甘孜、阿坝两个藏族自治州和凉山彝族自治州，今年又有四百六十多名藏、彝、羌等族干部，被提拔到区以上机关和群众团体中参加领导工作。这个数字接近过去几年提拔的区级以上民族干部的总和。
    甘孜藏族自治州各县的中共县委委员中，民族干部占一半以上的有八个县；凉山彝族自治州十二个县，除三个县外，每个县都有一两个彝族干部任中共县委委员。
    现在各自治州的各个部门，共有民族干部六千二百多人。过去，他们绝大多数都是普通的农民、牧民或劳动妇女。几年来，他们在党和人民政府为他们专门开办的许多民族干部学校和干部训练班中，学习了民族政策、国内外时事以及本民族文化知识。他们毕业后，在工作中得到汉族干部的帮助，工作能力提高很快。解放前在甘孜藏族自治州巴塘县当皮鞋工人的曾却扎（藏），现在是这个州的中共地委委员和藏民团副团长。甘孜藏族自治州道孚县副县长昂翁茨列（藏），贸易公司副经理向秀珍（藏、女），阿坝藏族自治州汶川县副县长陈宗彬（羌）等，过去都是一字不识的农民。
    在最近举行的一次民族工作会议上中共四川省委员会要求以上各自治州的中共组织普遍地再进行一次反对大汉族主义思想的教育，把培养民族干部的工作当成检查各级党委和每个汉族干部特别是领导干部工作好坏的主要内容之一；对于民族干部中的领导骨干，应该有相当的汉族领导干部分工负责帮助，积极采取措施，提高民族干部的政策，业务和文化水平。
