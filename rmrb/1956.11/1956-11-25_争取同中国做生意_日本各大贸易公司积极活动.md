Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, November 23rd: According to the "Industrial Economic News," Japan's largest trading companies in the Kanto and Kansai regions, such as Mitsubishi and Mitsui, are actively engaged in trade activities with China in light of new developments such as the agreement reached in the Soviet-Japanese negotiations.

The newspaper cited the example of Sumitomo Corporation, which has quadrupled the capital of its subsidiary, Daika Trading Company, and mainly exports fertilizers and chemical products to China.

Marubeni-Iida Co., Ltd., a large trading company with capital of 3.2 billion yen, plans to increase the capital of its subsidiaries, Toho Trading Co., Ltd. and Wako Trading Co., Ltd., by four times and two times respectively before February next year, and will send deputy director-level personnel to China to discuss increasing trade. In addition to sending personnel to participate in the commodity exhibition held in China, the major textile company Nichimen Jitsugyo Co., Ltd. is applying to participate in the second delegation of Japanese business circles to visit China to discuss trade issues with the Chinese side.

"Industrial Economic News" stated that there are three reasons for the active engagement of major Japanese trading companies: (1) Seeing the significant increase in Sino-Japanese trade and estimating that Sino-Japanese trade will further increase after China implements its second Five-Year Plan for economic construction; (2) The Southeast Asian market faces the risks of reduced purchasing power and political instability, while China not only avoids these risks but is also a good market in terms of both exports and imports;
  (3) Japanese trading companies are worried that missing the opportunity will lead to the risk of being driven out of the Chinese market by Western European countries.

    争取同中国做生意
    日本各大贸易公司积极活动
    据新华社23日讯　东京消息：据“产业经济新闻”报道，日本三菱、三井等关东和关西地区的最大贸易公司在苏日谈判达成协议等新情况下，正积极进行同中国的贸易活动。
    报纸举例说，住友商事公司已经把它的子公司大华贸易公司的资金增加了四倍，并且主要向中国输出了肥料和化学制品。
    拥有资金三十二亿日元的大贸易公司——丸红饭田公司准备把它的子公司东邦商会和和光贸易公司的资金在明年2月以前分别增加四倍和两倍，并且要派遣副社长级的人员前往中国商洽增加贸易。大纺织公司日绵实业公司除了派人参加了在中国举行的商品展览会以外，正在申请参加日本实业界访问中国的第二个代表团，来同中国方面接洽贸易问题。
    “产业经济新闻”说，日本的大贸易公司积极活动起来的原因有三：（一）看到日中贸易有了显著的增加，并且估计到中国实行第二个五年经济建设计划后日中贸易将会进一步增加；（二）东南亚市场有着购买力降低和政局不稳的危险，中国不仅没有这种危险而且在输出和输入方面都是一个好市场；
  （三）日本贸易公司担心错过机会就有被西欧国家从中国市场上赶出来的危险。
