Currently, the products it produces account for more than 20% of the total output of metallurgical enterprises in the country. Babiński said that the Lenin Metallurgical Combine will continue to undergo large-scale expansion work. In the future, two new blast furnaces will be built here. The expansion of the steelmaking plant will include the construction of a new 370-ton open-hearth furnace. A new coking plant and a giant cold-rolled steel sheet plant will also be established.
