Overseas Chinese Will Never Forget Mr. Sun Yat-sen
Chen Qiyou

Mr. Sun Yat-sen was a great pioneer of democratic revolution for the Chinese people. His glorious achievements throughout his life of struggle are something that the Chinese people can never forget, and the great influence he had on overseas Chinese is something that we overseas Chinese can never forget. His great revolutionary spirit and noble character will always strongly inspire us overseas Chinese.

We know that Mr. Sun Yat-sen spent nearly half of his forty years of revolution abroad, engaging in revolutionary work among overseas Chinese, including education, enlightenment, propaganda, mobilization, organization, and planning. He was deeply loved, supported, and supported by overseas Chinese. The reason for this is that Mr. Sun Yat-sen always firmly stood for the independence and prosperity of the motherland and the well-being of the people. Therefore, he could understand the masses and was willing to approach the masses. On the other hand, overseas Chinese, suffering from imperialist oppression, deeply felt the corruption and incompetence of the Qing Dynasty government and the Northern Warlord government, and eagerly hoped for political reforms in the motherland. Naturally, they easily accepted Mr. Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary theory and were willing to support Mr. Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary work.

Because of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's continuous work among overseas Chinese, many overseas Chinese quickly accepted revolutionary ideas, and many followed him to participate in the actual work of the revolution. There are countless examples of overseas Chinese sacrificing their lives for the cause of overthrowing the feudal Qing Dynasty and establishing the Republic of China. For example, many overseas Chinese youths participated in the Guangzhou Uprising on March 29, 1911; also, the martyr Wen Shengcai, who assassinated Fuqi, was also an overseas Chinese; as for donating money, transporting arms, and sheltering revolutionary comrades for revolutionary work, the examples are too numerous to mention. For example, Mr. Zhang Jingjiang and others, overseas Chinese in France, sent back 50,000 yuan at one time to support the revolution.

Mr. Sun Yat-sen had a deep relationship with the Hongmen organizations among overseas Chinese. Although the overseas Chinese Hongmen was a feudal secret organization at the time, it represented a large part of the working class and had always been maintained by its creed of "loyalty, patriotism, solidarity, and chivalrous elimination of evil." It had a certain potential strength, and the number of people was large. Taking the Americas as an example, there were more than 250,000 overseas Chinese, of which about 200,000 were Hongmen members. Like other patriotic overseas Chinese, they were more likely to come into contact with new ideas because they lived far overseas. Due to their personal experience of direct persecution by imperialism, they had the characteristics of resisting imperialism and had a certain degree of revolutionary nature. Mr. Sun Yat-sen went deep into overseas Chinese society and saw this. Therefore, he attached great importance to this Hongmen organization and even participated in this organization himself. Mr. Sun Yat-sen joined the Hongmen Zhi Gong Tang in Honolulu, around 1904. I personally saw the certificate of admission in a publication of the American Hongmen Zhi Gong Tang at that time. Mr. Sun Yat-sen's signature of "Sun Wen" in steel pen still vividly remains in my memory.

After joining the Hongmen organization, Mr. Sun Yat-sen, with an unremitting spirit of teaching, carried out propaganda and education work for Hongmen members, propagating the idea of "expelling the Tartars, restoring China, and establishing the Republic of China," explaining revolutionary principles to the masses, resolving difficulties for overseas Chinese everywhere, advocating unity, and helping the Zhi Gong Tang to reform its affairs. He formulated eighty progressive bylaws, which profoundly educated overseas Chinese Hongmen members, promoted the development of revolutionary ideas among overseas Chinese, and sowed indelible seeds for the later series of actions of overseas Chinese loving the motherland. Under the influence of Mr. Sun Yat-sen, Hongmen overseas Chinese made significant contributions to the revolution. For example, after the failure of the Guangzhou Uprising on March 29, 1911, the domestic revolutionary cause was in urgent need of funds. Mr. Sun Yat-sen was in the Americas at the time and felt extremely difficult about this. After hearing about it, the brothers of the American Hongmen Zhi Gong Tang initiated donations and mortgaged the four Hongmen Zhi Gong Tang buildings in Toronto, Vancouver, and Victoria in Canada to borrow money and donate to revolutionary expenses. According to the late Mr. Situ Meitang, who personally told me, the funds raised this time alone amounted to 150,000 US dollars. Mr. Situ Meitang was the initiator of this fundraising. Later, after the success of the Xinhai Revolution, the travel expenses for Mr. Sun Yat-sen to return to China were also donated by the colleagues of the American Hongmen Zhi Gong Tang. At the same time, all the Hongmen overseas Chinese groups in the Americas issued telegrams supporting Mr. Sun Yat-sen's assumption of the presidency. As for the overseas Chinese and overseas Chinese Hongmen members in Southeast Asia and other places, they also did their best to support and assist Mr. Sun Yat-sen's revolution spiritually and materially.

Of course, although Mr. Sun Yat-sen attached great importance to the Hongmen secret societies, he never remained at the stage of solely relying on secret societies as revolutionary forces. With a constantly progressive spirit, he continuously improved his revolutionary ideas based on the development of the objective situation. After the success of the October Socialist Revolution in Russia, he recognized the power of workers and peasants and further determined the three major revolutionary policies of "allying with Russia, allying with the Communist Party, and assisting peasants and workers." Mr. Sun's great spirit of following the progress of the times is truly admirable. When Mr. Sun Yat-sen continued to progress, he never forgot to lead the overseas Chinese to move forward with him. When his propositions were revised and supplemented with the improvement of his understanding, he always repeatedly publicized and explained them to the overseas Chinese so that they could also understand the new principles. I remember that after Yuan Shikai became president, he vigorously bought over degenerate elements in the Kuomintang, causing the Kuomintang to lose its original revolutionary spirit. Mr. Sun Yat-sen was very angry about this, so he formed the Chinese Revolutionary Party in Japan to gather new and reliable forces to continue to implement revolutionary propositions. And he wrote letters to overseas Chinese groups to solicit opinions. This was completely correct. However, at that time, compromising elements within the Kuomintang strongly opposed it, and many of the most active supporters of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's proposition were overseas Chinese. Even after Sun Yat-sen's death until the Northern Expedition in 1926, in addition to enthusiastically donating to support the Northern Expedition, the American overseas Chinese Zhi Gong Tang also issued a telegram supporting the cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party.

Under the leadership and education of Mr. Sun Yat-sen, overseas Chinese and overseas Chinese Hongmen members made significant contributions to the Xinhai Revolution. Later, Mr. Sun Yat-sen said: "Overseas Chinese are the mother of the revolution," which is the supreme glory of overseas Chinese. We overseas Chinese should cherish and develop this glorious title. Today, when American imperialism is still occupying our territory of Taiwan, we overseas Chinese and overseas Chinese Hongmen members who have been educated and influenced by Mr. Sun Yat-sen should inherit the glorious achievements of the past and unite more closely with the people of the motherland, love the motherland, and make contributions to the peaceful liberation of Taiwan.

    华侨永远不忘孙中山先生
    陈其尤
    孙中山先生是中国人民伟大的民主主义革命的先行者，他奋斗的一生的光辉成就，是我们中国人民所永远不能忘记的，他所给予华侨的伟大影响，也是我们华侨所永远不能忘记的。他的伟大革命精神和崇高的人格，永远强烈地鼓舞着我们华侨。
    我们知道，中山先生一生从事革命四十年，其中差不多有一半左右的时间是奔走于海外，在海外华侨中做教育启蒙、宣传鼓动、组织策划的革命工作，深为海外华侨所爱戴、拥护和支持。其所以如此，这是因为中山先生始终坚决地站在为祖国求独立富强、为人民谋福利的立场，因此他能够了解群众，也愿意接近群众；另方面，海外华侨因受帝国主义的压迫，深感清朝政府、北洋军阀政府的腐败无能，切望对祖国政治有所改革，自然容易接受中山先生的革命理论，也愿意支持中山先生的革命工作。
    由于中山先生在华侨中不断的工作，使不少华侨很快地接受了革命思想，不少的人追随他参加了革命的实际工作。华侨人士为推翻前清封建皇朝，建立民国，抛头颅，洒热血，壮烈牺牲的事迹层出不穷，如1911年3月29日广州起义，就有不少华侨青年参加；又如行刺孚琦的温生才烈士也是华侨；至于为了革命工作，捐款献金，运送军械，掩护革命同志的事情，更不胜枚举。如旅法华侨张静江等先生，仅一次就寄回过五万元，支援革命。
    中山先生与华侨中的洪门组织更有深厚的关系。华侨洪门在当时虽是一封建秘密性的组织，但它代表着很大一部分劳动平民，而且一直为其“忠诚爱国、义气团结、义侠锄奸”的信条所维系，有一定的潜在力量，人数众多，仅以美洲而言，华侨人数共有二十五万多人，其中即有约二十万人是洪门人士。他们和其他爱国华侨一样，因远居海外，容易接触新思想，由于亲身遭到帝国主义的直接迫害，具有反抗帝国主义的特点，有一定程度的革命性。中山先生深入华侨社会看到了这一点，因此，很重视这种洪门组织，甚至自己还参加了这种组织。中山先生是在檀香山加入洪门致公堂的，时间大约是1904年。入堂证书，我曾亲见于美洲洪门致公堂当时所出的一种机关刊物上的摄影，中山先生用钢笔所写“孙文”二字的签名，至今犹活生生地留在我的记忆中。
    中山先生参加洪门组织后，更以诲人不倦的精神，对洪门人士进行宣传教育的工作，宣扬“驱除鞑虏，恢复中华，创立民国”的主张，在群众中讲解革命道理，在各地为华侨排难解纷，倡导团结，帮助致公堂进行堂务改革，定出了八十条进步的会章，使华侨洪门人士受到了深刻的教育，推动了华侨革命思想的发展，为后来华侨一联串热爱祖国的行动，种下了不可磨灭的种子。在中山先生的影响下，洪门华侨人士对革命作出了重大的贡献。如1911年3月29日广州起义失败后，国内革命事业需款甚急，中山先生当时在美洲，对此极感困难，美洲洪门致公堂兄弟们闻知后，即发起捐献，并将在加拿大的都郎度、温哥华、维多利三地的四所洪门致公堂大楼典押借款，捐充革命费用。据已故世的司徒美堂老同志亲自告诉我，仅这一次所筹的款就有十五万美金。司徒美堂老同志即是这次筹款的发起人。后辛亥革命成功，中山先生回国的路费也是美洲洪门致公堂同仁们赠送的。同时全美洲的洪门侨团都发出了通电，拥护中山先生就任总统。至于东南亚以及其他各地华侨和华侨洪门人士对于中山先生革命也同样是从精神上、物质上竭尽全力来赞助和支援的。
    当然，中山先生虽然十分重视洪门会党，但他决不是停留在单以会党为革命力量的阶段上，他以不断求进步的精神，根据客观形势的发展，不断改进了他的革命主张，在俄国十月社会主义革命成功后，他认识到工农的力量，更决定了“联俄、联共、扶助农工”的革命三大政策。先生这种跟随时代前进的伟大精神，实在令人崇敬。当中山先生不断进步的时候，他从不忘带动华侨跟随他一起前进。他的主张随他的认识的提高而有所修改补充时，他总是反复向华侨宣传讲解，使他们也能懂得新的道理。我记得当袁世凯任总统之后，大力收买国民党中的蜕化分子，使国民党丧失了原来的革命精神，中山先生对此十分愤慨，遂在日本另组中华革命党，以求集结新生可靠力量，继续贯彻革命主张。并写信给海外各侨团，征求意见。这是完全正确的。可是当时国民党内妥协分子极力反对，而支持中山先生这种主张最积极的很多是海外华侨。甚至孙中山先生逝世后一直到1926年北伐时期，美洲华侨除了热烈捐助支持北伐外，致公堂还发表了拥护国共合作的通电。
    海外华侨和华侨洪门人士，在中山先生的领导教育下，对辛亥革命作出过重大的贡献。后来，中山先生说：“华侨是革命之母”，这是华侨的无上光荣。我们华侨应该珍重发挥这种光荣的称号。在今天，美国帝国主义还窃据我国领土台湾的时候，我们受过中山先生的教育影响的华侨和华侨洪门人士，应该继承过去的光荣成就，和祖国人民一道，更紧密地团结起来，热爱祖国，为和平解放台湾作出贡献。
