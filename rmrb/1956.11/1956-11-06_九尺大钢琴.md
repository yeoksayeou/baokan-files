    Nine-Foot Grand Piano
    The first and largest piano made in China – a nine-foot grand piano – underwent its final tuning on October 29th.

    This piano was manufactured by veteran workers with two to three decades of experience at the jointly owned Shanghai Piano Company. It possesses a large sound volume, making it suitable for use in large-scale concerts.

    The Shanghai Piano Company began manufacturing pianos in 1923 and is one of the oldest piano manufacturers in the country, with products that have been sold overseas.

    九尺大钢琴
    我国自制的第一架最大的钢琴——九尺的三角大钢琴，10月29日作了最后一次校音。
    这架钢琴是由公私合营上海琴行积有二、三十年经验的老工人制造的。它的音量很大，适合在大规模的演奏会上使用。
    上海琴行在1923年开始制造钢琴，是国内制造钢琴历史最久的琴行之一，产品曾远销国外。
