Xinhua News Agency, 7th — British Prime Minister Eden and French Prime Minister Mollet respectively published their replies on the 6th to the letter of the 5th from Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Bulganin. In their letters, they arbitrarily rejected Bulganin's proposal that Britain and France immediately cease their aggression against Egypt.

In his reply, Eden defended the Anglo-French aggression, describing its purpose as "seeking a peaceful solution." He also tried to cover up the crimes of Britain and France in indiscriminately bombing Egyptian towns and villages and peaceful residents, saying that the bombing "caused as little loss of life as possible."

Eden returned Bulganin's letter on the pretext that the "language" in the letter was "unacceptable."

In his reply to Bulganin, Mollet described the Anglo-French aggression as "forced to be taken." He also said: "This action is not a war against Egypt. The sole purpose of this action is to remedy certain aspects of the long-term insecurity in the Middle East." He insisted that the Egyptian government "has done everything possible in the past few months to increase the unrest in this region."

In their replies, Eden and Mollet both mentioned the so-called "Hungarian situation," attempting to confuse world public opinion and divert people's attention from the Anglo-French aggression against Egypt.

### 艾登和摩勒拒绝了苏联建议  竭力为英法对埃及的侵略行动辩护

    艾登和摩勒拒绝了苏联建议
    竭力为英法对埃及的侵略行动辩护
    新华社7日讯　英国首相艾登和法国总理摩勒分别在6日公布了他们对苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁5日的信的答复。他们在信里武断地拒绝了布尔加宁要求英法立即停止对埃及的侵略行动的建议。
    艾登在他的回信中为英法的侵略行为辩护，把这种侵略的目的说成是“要寻求一个和平解决”。他还竭力掩饰英法滥炸埃及城镇和乡村和平居民的罪行，说这种轰炸“所引起的生命损失是无法再少的”。
    艾登借口布尔加宁的信件里的“言词”是“不能接受”的，把这封信退了回去。
    摩勒在他给布尔加宁的回信中把英法的侵略行动说成是“被迫采取的”。他还说：“这种行动并不是对埃及进行战争。这种行动的唯一目的在于补救中东所发生的长期不安全的局面中的某些方面。”他硬说埃及政府“在过去若干月以来一直尽一切可能增进这一地区的不安局面”。
    艾登和摩勒在他们的回信中都提到了所谓“匈牙利局势”问题，企图混淆世界人民的视听，转移人们对英法侵略埃及的注意。
