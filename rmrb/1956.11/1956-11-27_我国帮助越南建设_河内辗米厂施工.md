Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 26th -- The groundbreaking ceremony for the first rice milling plant in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam was held this afternoon in the southern suburbs of Hanoi.

　　This rice milling plant will be entirely equipped with new-style machines produced in China. After it is completed and put into production in July next year, it will be able to mill 180 tons of rice per day, enough to supply the entire population of Hanoi.

　　The Hanoi Rice Milling Plant is the first of ten rice milling plants that China is preparing to help Vietnam build. The other two factories, which have already been scheduled to start construction, are in Haiphong and Nam Dinh. They will begin construction in January next year and will be the same size as the Hanoi Rice Milling Plant.

    我国帮助越南建设
    河内辗米厂施工
    新华社河内26日电　越南民主共和国第一个辗米厂今天下午在河内南郊举行施工典礼。
    这个辗米厂将全部安装中国生产的新式机器，在明年7月建成和投入生产以后，每天可辗米一百八十吨，足以供给河内全市人口食用。
    河内辗米厂是中国准备帮助越南修建的十个辗米厂中的第一个。已经确定动工时间的另外两个厂在海防和南定。它们将在明年1月开始兴建，规模和河内辗米厂一样大。
