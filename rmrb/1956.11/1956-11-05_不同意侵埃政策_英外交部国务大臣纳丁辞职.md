Xinhua News Agency, London, November 4th: British officials announced on November 3rd that the British Minister of State for Foreign Affairs and British Representative to the United Nations, Nutting, had resigned because he disagreed with the Conservative government's policy towards Egypt.

In a letter to British Prime Minister Eden, Nutting said that for some time he had been "increasingly unable to agree" with certain aspects of the government's foreign policy regarding the Middle East. He said: "In particular, I have very strongly advised the government against taking the decisions and actions regarding the current war between Israel and Egypt."

Nutting wrote: "For these reasons, I do not believe I can any longer defend the government's position in Parliament or at the United Nations."

Eden has accepted Nutting's resignation.

In recent years, Nutting has been considered a leading "Young Conservative"; he was chairman of the movement in 1950.

Nutting's sudden action, formally announced four days after Britain and France took military action against Egypt, has taken the ruling Conservative Party by surprise, which is now under sharp attack from the opposition Labour Party for its Middle East policy.

    不同意侵埃政策
    英外交部国务大臣纳丁辞职
    新华社4日讯　伦敦消息：英国官方11月3日宣布，英国外交部国务大臣、英国驻联合国代表纳丁已经辞职，因为他不同意保守党政府对埃及采取的政策。
    纳丁在写给英国首相艾登的一封信里说，若干时候以来，他一直是“越来越不能同意”政府关于中东的外交政策的某些方面。他说：“特别是我已经极为强烈地向政府提出过忠告，劝它不要采取关于现在以色列和埃及正在进行的战争的决定和行动”。
    纳丁写道：“由于这些原因，我认为我不可能再在议会里，或者在联合国中维护政府的立场。”
    艾登已经接受了纳丁的辞职。
    在过去几年间纳丁被认为是一个首要的“青年保守党人”，在1950年时他是这个运动的主席。
    在英法对埃及采取军事行动四天以后所正式宣布的纳丁的突如其来的行动，使得执政的保守党非常吃惊，保守党现在正由于它的中东政策而受到反对党工党的尖锐的攻击。
