    Lessons of the Egyptian Incident
    Hu Ping
    The four Muslim countries participating in the Baghdad Pact—Iraq, Turkey, Iran, and Pakistan—recently held a meeting in Tehran. Following this meeting, the Iraqi government announced that it was severing diplomatic relations with France and that its activities within the Baghdad Pact would be limited to meetings with the other three Muslim member states, expressing unwillingness to meet with Britain any longer.
    This decision by the Iraqi government marks a further decline in the power and influence of British and French imperialism in the Middle East. This decision was made in the context of the strong opposition of the people of the Middle East and Near East countries to the British and French aggression against Egypt. This extremely barbarous and blatant act of aggression by Britain and France thoroughly exposed their colonialist faces, thereby also revealing more clearly the purpose for which they organized the Baghdad Pact group. This made it impossible for those countries participating in the Baghdad Pact group not to reconsider their position and stance.
    In a radio address on November 7, British Foreign Secretary Lloyd stated unequivocally that Britain was attacking Egypt this time because it felt "particularly concerned" about the Middle East; its concern was due to four reasons: first, "historical reasons arising from the mandate"; second, "the Middle East is the thoroughfare between Europe, Asia, and Africa"; third, "it contains vast oil resources"; fourth, "it has the Suez Canal."
    Lloyd also mentioned that Britain's participation in the 1950 Tripartite Declaration of the United States, Britain, and France and its participation in the Baghdad Pact were also based on consideration of the above-mentioned aspects.
    From Lloyd's speech, it is not difficult to get a clear impression that the series of activities carried out by the United States, Britain, and France in the Middle East in the past, compared with this armed attack on Egypt, although different in means, were all aimed at: maintaining and expanding their colonial interests in the Middle East and Near East, occupying the Middle East as a strategic stronghold, and seizing the oil resources and the Suez Canal there.
    After World War II, due to the unprecedented upsurge in the movement for national independence in the countries of the Middle East and Near East, the contradictions between the United States, Britain, and France in the Middle East also became increasingly acute. The old colonial system in which colonial countries enslaved the countries of the Middle East and Near East in the form of "mandated territories," "protectorates," and "colonies" no longer worked, and Arab countries successively gained independent status. However, the colonial countries never forgot to organize counterattacks in various forms while being forced to retreat. Provoking the Israeli-Arab dispute to disperse the strength of the Arab countries' struggle for national independence is one form; signing the Tripartite Declaration to coordinate the contradictions between colonial countries and jointly control the Middle East is another form; and organizing military blocs is yet another, most vicious form.
    Under the guise of "anti-communism," "defense," and "maintaining peace," the United States and Britain have been trying for several years to incorporate the newly independent countries of the Middle East and Near East into a military bloc serving the colonial countries. Because by signing such group treaties, colonial countries can, on the one hand, turn the Middle East and Near East countries into bases for preparing for a new world war, and on the other hand, give them a legitimate basis to gradually control the military, economic, and even political affairs of the Middle East and Near East countries, suppressing these countries' activities to safeguard national sovereignty. When the United States and Britain began planning this group, their first goal was to draw in Egypt, which occupies a key position. However, the Egyptian government resolutely thwarted the colonial countries' conspiracy to add new colonial shackles to its head. Therefore, the United States and Britain turned their attention to the so-called "Northern Tier" and gradually formed the Baghdad Pact. This treaty not only bound certain Middle East and Near East countries, but also divided the unity of the Arab countries. The existence of the Baghdad Pact played an encouraging role in Britain and France daring to attack Egypt without any scruples this time. It is not difficult to see that some Arab countries participating in the Baghdad Pact are in a rather difficult situation in this British-French aggression against Egypt. According to their own national interests, they must stand on the side of their sister country that has been invaded; however, according to the Baghdad Pact, they are with the aggressors.
    This Egyptian incident should enable the countries participating in the Baghdad Pact to see clearly what the true meaning of those beautiful words written in the Baghdad Pact by the colonial countries really is. Even now, Eden and Mollet are still stubbornly calling their aggression against Egypt an action to "maintain peace and security in the Middle East"; and the same words are also the main excuse used by the signatories of the Baghdad Pact.
    If Britain and France can use such a shameless excuse to attack Egypt today, who can guarantee that when the countries participating in the Baghdad Pact resolutely safeguard their sovereignty and independence, Britain will not use the same excuse to attack them? If this happens, it will be much more convenient for the colonial countries to attack them than to attack Egypt, because they not only have ready-made treaty provisions to quote, but also have military bases and military institutions set up in these countries that can be used.
    Therefore, after the British and French aggression against Egypt, it is only natural that the broad masses of the people in countries that have already joined the military blocs organized by colonial countries feel that they have fallen into a dangerous situation of being in the company of tigers and wolves. Not only the countries participating in the Baghdad Pact feel this way, but also the countries participating in the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization have the same feeling. The United Press International acknowledged that the actions of Britain and France "have aroused opposition to the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization among the Thai people."
    A major lesson that can be drawn from the British and French aggression against Egypt is that the biggest enemy facing all newly independent Asian and African countries is still the imperialist countries that are trying to re-establish the colonial system in this region. Asian and African countries uniting to resist all kinds of aggression by colonial countries is the most important factor in safeguarding independence, sovereignty, and maintaining peace in the Asian and African regions.
    The actions taken by Iraq now are conducive to unity among Arab countries and improving its position among Arab countries. However, it should also be noted that countries like Turkey have close relations with the United States. Therefore, people must be vigilant against the possibility that the United States may replace Britain and enter Iraq. If this happens, then Iraq is merely driving away the wolf from the front door and letting the tiger in through the back door. And this is a very dangerous thing for Iraq and other Arab countries.

    埃及事件的教训
    胡平
    参加巴格达条约的四个穆斯林国家——伊拉克、土耳其、伊朗和巴基斯坦最近在德黑兰举行了一次会议。在这次会议之后，伊拉克政府宣布：它和法国断绝外交关系；它对巴格达条约的活动将限于同其他三个穆斯林国家成员国举行会议，而不愿意再同英国在一道举行会议。
    伊拉克政府这个决定，标志着英、法帝国主义在中东的势力和影响的进一步没落。这个决定是在中近东各国人民强烈反对英、法侵略埃及的形势下作出来的。英、法这次极端野蛮而且露骨的侵略行动，彻底地暴露了它们的殖民主义面目，从而也把它们组织巴格达条约集团的目的更清楚地暴露出来了。这就使得那些参加巴格达条约集团的国家不能不重新考虑它们的地位和立场。
    英国外交大臣劳埃德在11月7日的广播演说中毫不含糊地说，英国这次要进攻埃及，是因为它对中近东“特别感到关切”；其所以关切是由于四个原因：第一、“由于委任统治而造成的历史上的原因”；第二、“中东是欧洲、亚洲和非洲之间的通衢要道”；第三、“它蕴藏着大量的石油资源”；第四、“它那里有着苏伊士运河”。
    劳埃德还提到，英国参加1950年的美、英、法三国宣言和参加巴格达条约，同样也是出于对上述几个方面的考虑。
    从劳埃德的演说中不难给人一个清楚的印象，美、英、法这些殖民国家过去在中东进行的一系列活动，同这次武装进攻埃及相比，虽然手段不同，但目的却都是在于：维护和扩大它们在中近东的殖民利益，霸据中近东作为战略要地，占有那里的石油资源和苏伊士运河。
    第二次世界大战后，由于中近东各国要求民族独立的运动空前高涨，美、英、法在中东的矛盾也日益尖锐，过去殖民国家以“委任统治地”、“保护国”、“殖民地”等形式来奴役中近东国家的老一套殖民制度已经行不通了，阿拉伯国家纷纷取得了独立地位。但是，殖民国家在被迫后退时一刻也没有忘记以各种形式来组织反攻。挑拨以色列—阿拉伯纷争，以分散阿拉伯国家争取民族独立运动的力量，这是一种形式；签订三国宣言，以协调殖民国家相互间的矛盾，合力控制中东，这是另一种形式；而组织军事集团是又一种最恶毒的形式。
    美、英两国打着“反共”、“防御”和“维护和平”的幌子，几年来一直在想法把新近赢得独立的中近东国家纳入一个为殖民国家服务的军事集团中去。因为借助于签订这种集团的条约，殖民国家一方面可以把中近东国家变为它们准备新的世界大战的基地，而另一方面又使它们有合法的根据以逐步控制中近东国家的军事、经济以至政治，镇压这些国家维护国家主权的活动。美、英两国开始策划这种集团时，第一个目标是想把居于要冲地位的埃及拉进去。但是，埃及政府坚决地挫败了殖民国家这种把新的殖民枷锁加到它头上的阴谋。于是，美、英两国的目光就转向所谓“北层”，一步一步地搞起了巴格达条约。这个条约不但束缚了某些中近东国家，而且分化了阿拉伯国家的团结。英、法这次敢于毫无顾忌地向埃及进攻，巴格达条约的存在是起了鼓励作用的。不难看出，某些参加了巴格达条约的阿拉伯国家在这次英法侵略埃及事件中的处境是相当困难的。根据它们自己的民族利益，它们必须站在受到侵略的自己的姐妹国家这一边；但是，根据巴格达条约，它们却是和侵略者在一起。
    这次的埃及事件，使得参加巴格达条约的国家都应该能够看清楚，殖民国家写在巴格达条约中的那些漂亮词句的真实含义究竟是什么。直到现在，艾登和摩勒还在把他们对埃及的侵略硬说成是“维护中东的和平和安全”的行动；而同样的词句正也是巴格达条约签订者最主要的一个借口。
    如果说，英、法今天可以用这种无耻的借口来进攻埃及，谁又能保证当参加巴格达条约的国家坚决维护自己的主权和独立的时候，英国不会用同样的借口来进攻它们呢？如果发生了这种情况，殖民国家进攻它们要比进攻埃及更方便得多，因为它们不但有现成的条约条文可以引用，而且还有设在这些国家的军事基地和军事机构可以应用。
    因此，这次英法侵略埃及的事件发生之后，已经参加殖民国家所组织的军事集团的国家的广大人民感到自己陷入了与虎狼为伍的险境，这是很自然的。不但参加了巴格达条约的国家如此，参加了东南亚条约的国家也有同感。美国合众社承认，英法的行动“已经在泰国人民中间引起了反对东南亚条约组织的情绪”。
    从英、法侵略埃及的行动中可以得出的一个重大教训，就是一切新近赢得独立的亚非国家面临的最大的敌人，仍然是企图在这个地区重新恢复殖民主义制度的帝国主义国家。亚非国家团结起来，反抗殖民国家各式各样的侵略，是维护独立、主权和维护亚非地区的和平的最主要的因素。
    伊拉克现在采取的行动，是有助于阿拉伯国家之间的团结和改善它在阿拉伯国家中的地位的。但是，同时也应该看到，像土耳其这些国家都是同美国有密切关系的。因此，人们必须警惕美国可能代替英国而进入伊拉克。如果发生了这种情况的话，那末伊拉克不过是在前门拒狼、后门揖虎而已。而这对于伊拉克和其他阿拉伯国家都是十分危险的事情。
