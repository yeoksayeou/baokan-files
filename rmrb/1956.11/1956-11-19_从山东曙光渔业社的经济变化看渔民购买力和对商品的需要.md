From the Economic Changes of the Shandong Shuguang Fishery Cooperative Seen From the Purchasing Power and Needs of Fishermen
	Duan Jinglin Wu Ding'an

The Shuguang Fishery Production Cooperative is located in Xikou Village, Zhifu Island, Yantai City, Shandong Province, twenty-three li from the city. More than 98% of the fishing households in the village have joined the advanced fishery cooperative, totaling one hundred and forty-three households with five hundred and ninety-three people. After cooperativization, the fishermen are highly motivated to produce. In the first small sea market production this year, they caught 153,385 jin of prawns, an increase of 84.8% over the original plan, and 4.5 times higher than the village's total prawn output in 1952. It was rated as a high-yield prawn cooperative in the small sea market production competition.

In the two years since the establishment of the Shuguang Fishery Cooperative, it has accumulated more than 7,000 yuan in public accumulation funds, accounting for more than 11% of the total income. The number of fishing boats has also increased from five before the establishment of the cooperative to fifty-four. In order to meet the needs of fish transportation, eight rubber-tired carts have been purchased, bringing the total number of carts to twelve, and four fish ponds have been built with a total capacity of more than 100,000 jin of fish.

Production and Purchasing Power of Members
	Have Been Growing

With the improvement of production tools and technology, and the continuous improvement of various systems within the cooperative, the output of the Shuguang Fishery Cooperative has grown rapidly in recent years. This year, due to the expansion of the cooperative's establishment, the increase has been even greater. In terms of output comparison, 1954 increased by 27,600 jin compared to 1953, an increase of 17.5%; 1955 increased by 19,000 jin compared to 1954, an increase of 10.4%, while 1956 is expected to increase more than two times compared to last year.

With the increase in production, the purchasing power of the members has generally increased. At the same time, in order to ensure the increased income of the members, some unnecessary expenses have also been reduced this year. The proportion of public accumulation funds and public welfare funds to the total income has decreased by 1.67% compared to last year. The average purchasing power per person in the cooperative was 66 yuan in 1953, 99 yuan in 1954, 101 yuan in 1955, and is expected to reach about 120 yuan this year. Xia Hongchuan's family, a fishing household of five people, with one and a half laborers, had a purchasing power of 619 yuan in 1954, which increased to more than 900 yuan in 1955. Xia Detang's family, a fishing household of four people, with one laborer, had a purchasing power of 445 yuan in 1954, which increased to 597 yuan in 1955, and is expected to increase to more than 700 yuan this year.

With the development of production, the living standards of fishermen have been greatly improved. The more significant changes in the fishing village are not only reflected in food, clothing, and use, but also learning culture has become a more prominent requirement for fishermen. The young people all say that in order to participate in fishery production, in addition to practical experience, they must also have culture to improve technology and increase production. Therefore, a literacy committee has been established here to make plans for eliminating illiteracy. There are currently seven literacy groups, with more than forty people, mostly elderly people around the age of forty or fifty who are illiterate. About ninety-five people are participating in the people's school. They are all highly motivated to learn and can insist on studying for the prescribed two hours every day.

It is understood that the students of the people's school need the following cultural supplies: five pencils per person per year; four to five notebooks. Students in the third grade and above generally have fountain pens.

The fishery cooperative has subscribed to twenty-four newspapers. Although each team has an average of one newspaper, it still cannot meet their needs because fishing boats are scattered at sea.

Consumption Characteristics and Needs of Fishermen

From the situation of a small symposium and interviews with some fishermen, the general living standards of the fishing village are higher than those of the countryside. The main income of fishermen is fishery production, so they need to spend money to buy food, clothing, and supplies, which is different from farmers in the purchase of living materials.

The proportion of food expenditure is the largest in the total expenditure of fishermen. It is estimated that the expenditure on staple food accounts for about 30% of the total expenditure of fishermen; plus non-staple food, the proportion of food accounts for 45%. Taking Xia Detang's fishing household as an example, the proportion of total household commodity expenditure is as follows: staple food 32.35%, non-staple food 16.16%, firewood 12.94%, cigarettes and alcohol 4%, textiles 10.54%, department store goods 9.22%, medicine 5.54%, non-commodity expenditure 5%, other 4.25%.

Almost all fishermen have the habit of drinking and smoking. For example, Xia Hongchuan drinks six jin of wine a year, and the family's expenditure on cigarettes and alcohol accounts for 7% of their purchasing power. Xia Detang drinks ten jin of wine and smokes twelve jin of cigarettes a year. Because the cooperative has tighter control over the members' living expenses, fishermen generally drink less than in the past.

Drinking tea is also one of the hobbies of fishermen. There are tea sets on the fishing boats, and almost every pot has tea leaves. The general demand for tea among fishermen is about two or three jin a year.

Fishermen prefer items that are strong, durable, beautiful, generous, and not afraid of moisture. In the past, fishermen wore a set of tattered clothes for many years, and had no money to replace them at all; the quilts were even shorter. Now it is different, everyone has two or three sets of clothes. There are also different requirements for the variety of fabrics: adults generally need serge; wearing printed cloth is a traditional habit of women, especially girls and daughters-in-law who now have income and are willing to sew some fancy clothes to wear during festivals or when visiting relatives. The climate on the water is colder, and the time for wearing cotton clothes is longer, so cotton cloth consumption is relatively high, and raincoats and oilcloth are also indispensable.

Due to the characteristics of working on the water, most fishermen buy shoes to wear. Hercules shoes, sneakers, rain boots, and cloth-faced leather-soled shoes are most popular among young men and women. The demand for small department store goods such as towels and toothpaste is increasing year by year. The demand for towels by women is the most prominent, with an average of two towels per person per year. Brushing teeth is more common among young people, with an average of two toothbrushes per household and about three bottles of toothpaste used per year. For example, Xia Hongchuan and Xia Detang's family use two toothbrushes and four bottles of toothpaste every year. The purchase of sweaters and leather shoes is also increasing day by day. At the symposium, they generally requested the supply of medium-priced wool.

In addition, after the economic independence of fishermen's wives, many buy face powder, perfume, cologne, cold cream, face oil, pomade, and various scented soaps. There are many items that fishing village girls buy when they get married, such as dressing boxes, mirrors, floral sheets, and silk quilt covers.

A Few Requirements of Fishermen

1. The problem of not being able to buy vegetables in the fishing village is more serious, mainly because there are few people growing vegetables, and few vendors come to sell them. Some fishermen only go to Yantai City to buy some vegetables to eat during festivals, and usually use fish instead of vegetables. They urgently require the supply of vegetables.

2. After women participate in production, they begin to feel that making shoes and sewing clothes will reduce their working days, so they are willing to draw special personnel to learn sewing technology to replace the current manual production. They said: "Doing so is both good-looking and saves time."

3. They also require an increase in books and recreational and sports supplies. Fishermen like to sing, but there are no musical instruments and they lack organization.

4. They request the establishment of fishermen's canteens with cheaper meals. Especially the female comrades in the transportation team, who transport fish during the day, and the fishing boats do not have a fixed time to return, and even have to unload fish at night when production is busy, so they do not have time to cook.

On the Issue of Trade Forms

There is no supply and marketing cooperative in Xikou Village, and few peddlers go to sell things. Fishermen have to go four or five li away to buy the daily necessities they need, or ask the transportation team to buy them in Yantai City. They urgently require state-owned companies and supply and marketing cooperatives to organize some peddlers or mobile sales teams to go to the countryside to sell.

Because fishermen are busy with production and learning after joining the cooperative, they rarely have time to buy things themselves. Therefore, some new situations of collective purchase by the cooperative and distribution by household have emerged in rural transactions, especially for production materials and bulk commodities with simpler varieties, such as coal, salt, and wood. The old way of waiting for customers to come to the door can no longer meet the objective needs. We suggest that state-owned companies help supply and marketing cooperatives and fishery production cooperatives sign supply and sales contracts, and deliver or pick up goods regularly at the prescribed time to meet the purchase and sale needs of fishermen.

    从山东曙光渔业社的经济变化看渔民购买力和对商品的需要
    段景林　吴定安
    曙光渔业生产合作社在山东省烟台市芝罘岛西口村，距市区二十三里。全村98％以上的渔户加入了渔业高级社，共一百四十三户，五百九十三人。合作化后，渔民生产情绪很高。今年第一个小海市生产中，就捕获大虾十五万三千三百八十五斤，较原订计划增产84.8％，比1952年全村大虾产量提高了4.5倍；在市的生产评比会上被评为小海市大虾高额丰产社。
    曙光渔业社建社两年来，共积累了公积金七千多元，占总收入的11％强。渔船也由建社前的五只增加到五十四只。为了满足运鱼的需要，已购买胶轮车八辆，连原有车共计十二辆；并且修建了共可容鱼十万多斤的四个鱼池。
    历年生产量和社员购买力
        都在增长
    随着生产工具和技术的改进，和社内各种制度的不断完善，几年来，曙光渔业社的产量增长很快。今年因扩大建社，上升幅度更高。按产量比较，1954年较1953年增加二万七千六百斤，上升幅度是17.5％；1955年较1954年增加一万九千斤；上升幅度是10.4％，而1956年比去年将要增加两倍多。
    生产增加，社员的购买力普遍上升。同时，为了保证社员增加收入，今年也减少了一些不必要的开销。公积金、公益金占总收入的比例，比去年降低了1.67％。全社每人平均购买力在1953年为六十六元，1954年九十九元，1955年一百零一元，今年预计将达一百二十元左右。渔户夏宏川，全家五口人，有一个半劳动力，1954年的购买力为六百一十九元，1955年就增加到九百多元。渔户夏德堂，全家四口人，有一个劳动力，1954年的购买力是四百四十五元，1955年增加到五百九十七元，今年预计要增加到七百元以上。
    随着生产的发展，渔民生活得到了很大的改善。渔村发生的比较显著的变化，不只是表现在吃、穿、用方面，学习文化也成为渔民比较突出的要求。青年们都说：参加渔业生产，除了要有实际操作经验外，还必须有文化，才能提高技术，增加生产。因此，这里已成立了扫盲委员会，作了扫除文盲的规划。现有炕头组七个，四十多人，参加的多为四、五十岁左右不识字的老年人；参加民校的约有九十五人。他们的学习情绪都很高，每天都能按规定的两个小时坚持学习。
    据了解，民校学生对文化用品的需要是：每人一年铅笔五支；笔记本四到五本。三年级以上的学生一般都有钢笔。
    渔业社里已订了二十四份报，虽然平均每队都有一份报，但是由于出海捕鱼，渔船分散，所以仍旧不能满足他们的要求。
    渔民的消费特点和对商品的需要情况
    从一个小型座谈会上和对一些渔户进行访问的情况看，渔村生活水平一般较农村为高。渔民主要收入是渔业生产，因此吃、穿、用方面的物品，都需要花钱购买，这是和农民在生活资料的购买上不同的。
    渔民的全部支出中用在吃上的比重最大。估计主食的支出在渔民的全部支出中占30％左右；加上副食，吃的比重要占45％。以渔户夏德堂为例，全家大类商品支出比例如下：主食32.35％，副食16.16％，柴草12.94％，烟酒4％，纺织品10.54％，百货9.22％，医药5.54％，非商品支出5％，其他4.25％。
    渔民差不多都有饮酒吸烟的习惯，如夏宏川年饮酒六斤，全家烟酒支出占购买力7％。夏德堂年饮酒十斤，吸烟十二斤。因社内对社员的生活用款控制较紧，渔民饮酒一般已比过去减少。
    喝茶也是渔民的嗜好之一，渔船上有茶具，壶里有茶叶几乎是普遍情况。渔民对茶叶的需要量一般一年在二、三斤左右。
    渔民们都喜欢结实、耐用、好看、大方，不怕潮湿的物品。过去，渔民们多年都穿着一套破破烂烂的衣服，根本没钱更换；被盖更是短少。现在不同了，每人都有了两、三套衣服。对布匹的品种要求也有了不同：一般成年人需要线呢；穿花布是妇女们的传统习惯，特别是姑娘、媳妇们现在都有了收入，愿意缝制些逢年过节或走亲戚时穿的花衣服。水上气候较冷，穿棉衣的时间较长，所以棉布消费比较多，雨衣油布也不能缺少。
    由于水上作业的特点，大多数渔民都是买鞋穿。力士鞋、球鞋、雨鞋、布面皮底鞋最受男女青年们的欢迎。毛巾牙膏等小百货的需用量逐年增加，以妇女们需用毛巾为最突出，平均每人一年用两条。刷牙在青年人中比较普遍，一户平均有两把牙刷，一年用牙膏约三瓶。如夏宏川、夏德堂家，每年都用两把牙刷和四瓶牙膏。随着抽烟的需要，对火柴消费增大、个别户一年的需用量达四、五十包之多，一般消费二十包左右。购买毛衣、皮鞋的也日渐增多。在座谈会上，他们普遍要求供应中等价钱的毛线。
    此外，渔民妇女的经济独立后，购买香粉、香水、花露水、雪花膏、润面油、香脂和各种香皂的很多。渔村姑娘们结婚时，要买的用品很多，梳妆盒、镜子、花床单和丝绸被面等都很齐全。
      渔民的几点要求
    一、渔村买不到蔬菜的问题比较严重，主要是种菜的少，小贩也很少挑担来卖。有的渔民只是逢年过节的时候才去烟台市买点菜来吃，平时都是以鱼代菜。他们迫切要求供应蔬菜。
    二、妇女参加生产后，开始感到自己做鞋、缝衣会减少她们的劳动日，因此愿意抽出专人学习缝纫技术，来代替现在的手工制作。她们说：“这样做，既好看、又省时间。”
    三、他们还要求增加图书和文娱体育用品。渔民喜欢唱歌，但是没有乐器，也缺乏组织。
    四、要求建立饭菜比较便宜的渔民食堂。特别是运输队的女同志，日间运鱼，渔船往返没有一定的时间，生产忙时甚至夜间还要卸鱼，所以没有时间做饭。
      关于贸易形式问题
    西口村没有供销合作社，也很少有货郎去串卖东西，渔民们需要的生活用品，都要到四、五里路以外去购买，或者托运输队的人去烟台市购买。他们迫切要求国营公司和供销社组织一些货郎担或流动推销小组下乡串卖。
    由于渔民入社后都忙于生产和学习，很少有时间自己去买东西，因此农村的交易形式已经出现了一些以社为单位的集体购买和按户分配的新情况；特别是生产资料和花色品种比较简单的大宗商品，如煤炭、盐、木材等比较显著。过去坐等顾客上门的老一套供应办法，已不能适应客观需要。我们建议国营公司帮助供销合作社和渔业生产社订立供销合同，按规定时间定期送货或取货，以满足渔民们的购销需要。
