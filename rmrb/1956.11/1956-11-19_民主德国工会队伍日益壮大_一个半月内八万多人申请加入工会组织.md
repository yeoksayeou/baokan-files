Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 18th. According to a report in "Tribune" on the 17th, in the one and a half months from the beginning of October to now, 83,462 workers and staff in the industrial and mining enterprises of the German Democratic Republic have applied to join the Free German Trade Union Federation. This has increased the total number of members of the Free German Trade Union Federation to 5.5 million.

The trade union newspaper said that this large number of new trade union members submitted their applications at various rallies held recently by the Free German Trade Union Federation at all levels during the election period. This shows the support and trust of the working people of the German Democratic Republic in the trade union, and their satisfaction with the work of the trade union in the past period. At the 23rd and 24th Executive Committee meetings, the Free German Trade Union Federation made resolutions to expand the rights of trade unions in order to adapt to the government's further democratization measures. These resolutions have aroused great repercussions among the broad masses of working people.

When applying to join the trade union, the new members stated that they requested to join the working class's class organization—the Free German Trade Union Federation—in order to better complete the tasks of socialist construction and further consolidate the strength of the worker-peasant regime.

    民主德国工会队伍日益壮大
    一个半月内八万多人申请加入工会组织
    新华社柏林18日电　据“论坛报”17日报道，在从10月初到现在的一个半月期间，民主德国工矿企业的工人和职员有八万三千四百六十二人申请加入自由德国工会联合会。这样就使自由德国工会联合会的会员总数增加到五百五十万名。
    这家工会报纸说，这一大批工会新会员是在最近自由德国工会联合会各级组织举行选举期间的各种集会上提出他们的申请的。这表明民主德国劳动人民对工会的拥护和信任，以及对过去一个时期工会工作的满意。自由德国工会联合会在第二十三次和第二十四次执行委员会会议上，为了适应政府的进一步民主化的措施而做出了扩大工会权利的决议。这些决议在广大的劳动人民中引起了巨大的反响。
    新会员们在申请加入工会时，表示他们要求加入工人阶级的阶级组织——自由德国工会联合会，以便更好地完成社会主义建设的任务和进一步巩固工农政权的力量。
