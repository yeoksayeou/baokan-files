Treatment and nursing are two inseparable parts of medical work. Nursing, like treatment, is a specialized discipline that requires a broad foundation of scientific knowledge. Therefore, a nurse should possess knowledge of physiology, pathology, pharmacology, and various clinical disciplines, so that they can become a close comrade-in-arms of the physician in the fight against disease and provide effective care for patients.

With the development of our country's health and medical undertakings, nursing work has been greatly strengthened. At present, there are nearly 200,000 nursing staff in the country, who have made great contributions to the health cause under the guidance of revolutionary humanitarianism and advanced medical ideas.

On November 10th, reporters visited Beijing People's Hospital. These photos show how nurses spend their day.　Photographs by our reporter
　
　　The work of the day begins. At seven o'clock in the morning, nurses on the day and night shifts are handing over duties.

　　In the operating room, nurses are skillfully assisting physicians in complex surgeries.

　　The help of nurses enables patients to live in a comfortable environment, increasing their strength to fight the disease. This is a nurse changing a patient's dressing in the ward.

　　When emergency patients arrive, the nurses quickly and carefully perform preliminary examinations, determine the condition, prepare medications in advance, and collect laboratory specimens to help physicians shorten the treatment process and reduce the patient's suffering.

　　Obstetric nurses are explaining to first-time mothers how to take care of their babies.

　　Late at night, night shift nurses are still carefully observing patients lying in bed, sometimes asleep, sometimes awake, trying everything possible to make them comfortable during the night.

　　A patient with a fractured leg bone was distraught when he first entered the hospital. After the nurse's explanation, comfort, and patient care, his spirits improved as his condition improved.

　　The spirit of great maternal love is a unique feature of nursing work. Yu Xiaoni not only received good treatment but also received affectionate care. Xiaoni's condition is getting better day by day.

　　How to improve professional skills is a matter of concern for every nurse. Lu Shiyuan (right), head nurse of the orthopedic ward, usually pays attention to studying professional nursing knowledge. Now she is a member of the business learning center group of this hospital. This is Lu Shiyuan and others formulating a plan to study "Nursing before and after mitral valve surgery."

　　Bi Shugu (right) has been working as a nurse for more than 20 years since graduating from nursing school in 1930. He is the head night nurse of this hospital. This is Bi Shugu studying work with another veteran nurse, Li Guangwen.

　　This is nurses who love motorcycle sports learning to drive in their spare time.

　　Nursing work is a glorious and noble social labor. They are respected by the people. This hospital often receives letters of thanks from patients after discharge to the nurses, expressing their respect for the nurses. Patient Yu Rongtai wrote in his letter: "...What you do are ordinary things, but you are not ordinary people. The role you play for patients is extraordinary. I have drawn strength from you, and I am currently using this strength to recuperate and strive to get out of bed as soon as possible. In the future, I will use this strength to study and work..."

　　Work is over.

    护士的一天
    治疗和护理是医疗工作中不可分割的两个部分。护理工作和治疗工作一样，是一种专门的学术，需要有广泛的科学知识作基础。因此作为一个护士，应该具备生理学、病理学、药理学等方面的知识和各种临床知识，这样在和疾病作斗争中才能成为医师的密切战友，并对病人进行有效的护理。
    随着我国卫生医疗事业的发展，护理工作大大加强了。现在全国有护理工作人员近二十万人，他们在革命的人道主义和先进的医学思想指导下，对卫生事业作出很大的贡献。
    11月10日记者走访了北京人民医院。从这些照片里可以看出护士们是怎样度过他们的这一天。　本报记者摄影
    一天的工作开始了。早晨七点钟，日夜班的护士正在进行交接班。
    在手术室里，护士正熟练地配合着医师进行复杂的手术。
    护士的帮助，使病人能够生活在舒适的环境里，增加患者对疾病斗争的力量。这是护士正在病房里给病人换药。
    急诊病人来到以后，护士们迅速、谨慎地为他进行初步检查，判别病情，提早准备药物和收集化验标本，帮助医师缩短治疗过程，减少病人的痛苦。
    产科护士正在向头胎产妇们讲解怎样带好婴儿。
    夜深了，夜班护士仍在仔细地观察躺在病床上时而睡着、时而醒来的病人们，想尽办法使他们舒适地度过夜晚。
    一个折了腿骨的患者初进医院的时候，整天懊丧不安，经过护士的解释、安慰和耐心的护理，随着病情的好转，精神也愉快起来。
    伟大的母爱精神是护理工作特有的作风。于小霓得了病，不但得到了良好的治疗，而且得到亲切的护理。小霓的病一天比一天好起来了。
    怎样提高业务水平，是每个护士所关心的问题。骨科病房护士长吕式媛（右）平时很注意学习护理专业知识，现在她是这个医院的业务学习中心小组组员之一。这是吕式媛等在制订学习“心脏二尖瓣手术前后的护理”的计划。
    毕庶谷（右）从1930年在护士学校毕业到现在，从事护士工作已有二十多年了。他是这个医院的夜班护士长。这是毕庶谷正在和另一位老护士李广文研究工作。
    这是在业余时间里，喜爱摩托车运动的护士们在学习驾驶。
    护士工作是光荣高尚的社会劳动。他们受到了人们的尊重。这个医院经常收到患者出院后向护士们致谢的来信，表达对护士们的敬意。患者于荣泰的信中写道：“……您们所做的是些平凡的事，但是您们这些人确不是平凡的人，您们做这些事对病人所起的作用确不平凡。我从您们这里吸取了力量，在目前我用这种力量来养病，争取早一天起床。将来我要用这种力量来学习和工作。……”
    工作结束了。
