    Rescue Precious Historical Archives As Soon As Possible
    Sun Shikai
    People often hear scholars cry: there is a lack of data! Indeed, it is difficult to do scholarship without sufficient data. Scholars also often discover extremely valuable first-hand materials from historical archives, considering them "treasures."
    Now, let's look at the unfortunate fate of the countless "treasures" buried in the Historical Archives (formerly the Archives of the Palace Museum)! More than half of the three million-plus historical archives from the Qing Dynasty, spanning over 290 years, have been damaged. What is even more serious is that many people do not recognize this tragic situation as a major loss to our scholarship, and to this day, they turn a blind eye and remain indifferent.
    I had the opportunity to visit more than a dozen storage rooms of this archive and witnessed firsthand the disaster suffered by this huge collection of precious historical archives. According to the director of the archive, in addition to the Qing History Institute's main storage and the Cabinet's main storage, there are forty-six other storage rooms, of which only three or four rooms barely meet the requirements of an archive. The general storage rooms are very humid, and the stench of decaying paper is pungent. Hundreds of boxes of archives have already crumbled into paper scraps. A large number of cost archives have been immersed in water and have become hard "wooden boards." In the Qing History Institute's main storage, more than 1,700 sacks filled with archives are piled up like two small mountains. It is said that these were 8,000 sacks of archives transported from the Cabinet at the end of the Qing Dynasty, which were transferred to several places, and only 1,700 sacks remained when Beijing was liberated and were piled up here. I asked the director of the archive what era of archives the sacks contained. He said, "These sacks have never been touched, and no one knows what archives they contain. Only a few dozen sacks were opened to take a look in the third quarter of this year. Currently, we feel that these archives cannot be organized and have no ability to repack them."
    Now, the archivists not only lack scientific methods for cataloging and organizing, but also lack scientific knowledge for preserving the archives. Because the archive storage rooms are generally narrow and humid, the archives stored in many storage rooms are only two centimeters from the ground, but the ground is covered with lime (lime easily damages paper). To prevent insects, the archives are also sprinkled with "666" insecticide powder. It is said that this is unscientific, as it kills insects but also corrodes the paper. The work of repairing archives is entirely manual. There are currently four people working. Each person repairs only thirty to forty pages of archives a day. This repair rate is far behind the rate at which the archives in the storage rooms are decaying.
    The conditions for archivists are also very bad. Of the current thirty-three staff members, more than ten suffer from diseases such as tuberculosis, hypertension, and arthritis. Of the twenty-two preservation staff, only half can enter the storage rooms, but they have to manage more than fifty storage rooms of various sizes. One-third of the three million-plus archives preserved in this archive are in Manchu, but only two old gentlemen understand Manchu. Now, one of them has not been working on Manchu (he is editing the history of the Westernization Movement). The other old gentleman is nearly seventy years old and can only translate the dates of Manchu archives every day. Currently, the archive has sent four young cadres to learn Manchu, but they are far from being able to undertake the translation of a large number of Manchu archives.
    The director of the archive said: The most basic problem at present is to solve the storage room problem first, otherwise millions of archives will be almost completely rotten in a few years. When people hear this sentence and look at the archive's storage rooms, who doesn't feel heartbroken!
    I think anyone has the right to expect the relevant departments to take action as soon as possible to overcome difficulties and save this batch of precious historical archives from the disaster they are about to suffer.

    尽快抢救珍贵的历史档案资料
    孙世恺
    人们经常听到学者们的呼声：资料缺乏呀！确实，没有充分的资料很难做学问。学者们也往往从历史档案中发现十分珍贵的第一手资料，视为“珍宝”。
    现在，我们看看历史档案馆（原故宫博物院档案馆）里埋藏着无数“珍宝”的不幸遭遇吧！这里保存着清代二百九十多年的三百多万件历史档案已有一半以上损坏了。更严重的，是许多人看到这种惨况并不认识到它是我们学术上的重大损失，至今熟视无睹，无动于衷。
    我曾有机会参观了这个档案馆的十多个库房，亲眼看到这批数量巨大的珍贵的历史档案遭受的厄运。据档案馆主任说，这里除清史馆大库、内阁大库外，尚有四十六个库房，目前勉强合乎档案馆要求条件的只有三、四个房间。一般库房都是室内十分潮湿，纸张霉烂的臭气刺鼻。有上百箱档案已经碎成纸末。大量成本档案受水浸蚀后已成一块硬“木板”。在清史馆大库里，有装满档案的一千七百多个麻袋堆积得像两座小山，据说这是清代末年从内阁运出八千个麻袋档案，辗转几个地方，到北京解放时只剩下一千七百多个麻袋就堆在这里。我向档案馆主任询问麻袋装的是什么时代档案，他说：“这些麻袋从来无人动过，谁也不知道装的是什么档案，今年第三季度才打开几十袋看看，目前感到这些档案无法也无力整理又装起来了。”
    现在档案馆的工作人员不仅缺乏科学的编目整理办法，就是保管档案也缺乏科学知识。因档案库房一般都是窄小潮湿，许多库房存放的档案距地面只有两公分，地面却撒满石灰（石灰易浸坏纸张）。为了防虫又在档案上撒满“六六六”杀虫粉。据说这是不科学的，它虽然杀虫也浸蚀纸。修补档案工作完全是手工。现有四个人工作。每人一天只修补三、四十页档案。这样修补远远赶不上库房内档案霉烂得快。
    档案馆干部条件也很坏。现有三十三人，患肺结核病、高血压症和关节炎等病就有十多人。保管工作二十二人，能进库房的只有一半人，却要管理五十多个大小库房。这个档案馆保存三百多万件档案有三分之一是满文的，可是懂得满文的只有两位老先生，现在有一位还没有搞满文（在编辑洋务运动史）。另一位老先生年近七十岁，每天只能翻译些满文档案的年月日。现在，档案馆已派四个青年干部学习满文，但是，远远不能担负起大量满文档案的翻译工作。
    档案馆主任说：目前最基本的问题，应先解决库房问题，不然上百万件档案过几年就烂得差不多完了。人们听到这句话，再看看档案馆的库房，谁不感到痛心啊！
    我想任何人都有权盼望有关部门尽快动手克服困难，挽救这批珍贵的历史档案所即将遭到的厄运。
