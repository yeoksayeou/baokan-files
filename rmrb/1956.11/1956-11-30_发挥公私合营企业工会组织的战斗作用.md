    Give Play to the Combat Role of Trade Union Organizations in Joint State-Private Enterprises

    The National Conference of Basic-Level Trade Union Cadres in Joint State-Private Enterprises has concluded. Based on the changes in various conditions after the joint state-private ownership of capitalist enterprises, this conference stipulated the specific tasks and roles of trade union organizations in joint enterprises, and focused on studying the issue of democratic management in joint enterprises and how trade unions can correctly unite, educate, and transform capitalists. The resolution of these important issues will enable the smooth development of all aspects of work in joint enterprises.

    After the joint state-private ownership of entire industries, the relations of production in enterprises have changed. The capitalist production and management system has been basically replaced by the socialist production and management system. Along with this change, the internal relations of the enterprise – the relationship between the trade union and the enterprise administration, and the relationship between the trade union and the capitalists – are also different from before.

    In the original private enterprises, the relationship between the trade union and the administration was one of labor-capital opposition. After the joint ownership, although there are still capitalists in the enterprise, the entire administrative organization is dispatched by the state to manage the enterprise, representing the interests of the state and the working class. Therefore, the relationship between the trade union and the administration has become one of comradely cooperation. Precisely because of this change in relationship, the working methods and content of the trade union's work toward the private enterprise administration in the past are no longer applicable today. In the future, the trade union should mobilize the masses of workers and, together with the representatives of the state, unite and educate the capitalists, so that they can gradually be transformed into self-reliant laborers, and gradually carry out enterprise reforms in accordance with the principles of socialist management, and finally complete the socialist transformation, and promote the development of social productive forces. All trade union workers in joint state-private enterprises should have a correct understanding of this change in relationship after joint ownership, and the common tasks of the trade union and the administration. Otherwise, they will lose their direction in their work.

    In the past private enterprises, the trade union had fully played its role. For example, it led the masses of workers, established the superiority of the working class, and obtained the power to participate in enterprise management; through the trade union organization, the masses of workers conducted extensive supervision over the activities of the enterprise; the production increase and economy committees in the enterprise actually played the role of management committees, becoming powerful organs for the masses of workers to participate in the leadership and management of the enterprise. Through various activities, the trade union ensured the completion of state processing and ordering tasks, improved business management, and promoted the transformation of enterprises and capitalists; at the same time, it protected the democratic rights and material interests of the masses, and was warmly supported by the broad masses. Unfortunately, most joint enterprises later failed to inherit the experience of workers participating in management as a good tradition. The democratic management institutions were abolished, and some state representatives only one-sidedly emphasized administrative power, and did not consult with the masses on matters, so that many workers questioned their status as "masters of the enterprise," and their enthusiasm was reduced. And the trade union, because it could not or rarely participated in the leadership and management of the enterprise, lost or weakened its supervisory role. This greatly reduced the close ties between the trade union and the masses.

    This situation must be changed. The democratic tradition of workers in private enterprises participating in enterprise management should not only be inherited, but also be carried forward. The trade union's power of supervision should be restored. Democratic management institutions should be established in joint enterprises, and the trade union should organize the masses to participate in management, be responsible for the establishment of democratic management institutions, and realize supervision over administrative management work. At present, some enterprises adopt the organizational form of employee representative congresses and management committees to participate in enterprise management, which is very good. The employee representative congress is composed of employee representatives nominated by the masses and elected through universal suffrage; the management committee is elected by the employee representative congress or the general assembly of employees. Within the scope of not violating the instructions and orders of the higher-level administration, these institutions have the right to discuss various major issues within the factory and suggest that the administration implement them; if the opinions of the administration and the management committee are inconsistent, they can be reported to the higher-level administration and the higher-level trade union organization for resolution. With such a truly powerful democratic management institution, the production enthusiasm of the masses can be universally mobilized, and at the same time, the damage of bureaucratism to the rights and interests of workers can be prevented. Trade union organizations should actively strive to implement the principle of democratic management in joint enterprises and cooperate with the administration to better complete the task of socialist transformation.

    At present, some workers and some trade union cadres do not have a clear understanding of the party's policy of peaceful redemption, especially some specific measures in the policy of redemption. They believe that "capitalists are benefited too much," and therefore are not convinced in their hearts. The trade union organization should conduct a broad explanation of the redemption policy to all employees in joint state-private enterprises, so that they understand that: transforming capitalists into self-reliant laborers requires a preparation process. Although we pay a part of the price, we make the capitalists abandon the system of exploitation without resistance and participate in the socialist side, which is a victory for the working class.

    Today, capitalists in enterprises already have the status of general staff members. Trade union organizations should strengthen their work on them in the future, strive for them to participate in labor competitions more, support their correct opinions, encourage their progressive aspects, and criticize their erroneous thoughts and behaviors. Transforming capitalists is a long-term and complex task.

    The vast majority of capitalists are actively working hard and sincerely accepting socialist transformation after being assigned work; but there are also a very small number of people who are passively slacking off, engaging in corruption and seeking personal gain. Trade union organizations have the responsibility to unite the workers in the enterprise, promote righteousness, and prevent the growth of negative factors.

    In the past, trade unions created very good experiences in relying on activists to mobilize the masses and ensure the completion of state processing and ordering tasks. In the future, they should continue to carry forward this creative spirit and give full play to their role in socialist transformation and socialist construction.

### 发挥公私合营企业工会组织的战斗作用

    发挥公私合营企业工会组织的战斗作用
    全国公私合营企业工会基层干部大会闭幕了。这次大会根据资本主义企业公私合营以后各种条件的变化，规定了公私合营企业中工会组织的具体任务和作用，并着重研究了合营企业中的民主管理问题和工会如何正确地团结、教育、改造资本家的问题。这些重要问题的解决，将会使合营企业的各方面工作获得顺利的发展。
    全行业公私合营以后，企业的生产关系发生了变化。资本主义生产和经营制度已基本上为社会主义的生产和经营制度所代替。随着这个变化，企业内部的关系——工会同企业行政、工会同资本家的关系，也和以前不同了。
    在原先的私营企业中，工会同行政的关系就是劳资对立的关系。合营以后，虽然企业里还有资本家，但整个行政组织却是受国家委派来管理企业的，它代表着国家和工人阶级的利益。因此，工会和行政的关系就已经成为同志合作的关系了。正由于这一关系的改变，工会过去对待私营企业行政的工作方式和工作内容在今天就不适用了。今后，工会应当发动工人群众，和公方代表在一起，团结和教育资本家，使他们逐渐改造成为自食其力的劳动者，逐步按照社会主义经营管理的原则来进行企业改革，最后完成社会主义改造，促进社会生产力的发展。所有公私合营企业的工会工作者对于合营以后这种关系的变化，以及工会和行政的共同任务，应该有正确的认识。否则，就会在工作中迷失方向。
    在过去的私营企业中，工会曾经充分发挥了作用。例如，领导工人群众，树立了工人阶级的优势，取得了参与企业管理的权力；工人群众通过工会组织，对企业的活动进行了广泛的监督；企业中的增产节约委员会实际上起了管理委员会的作用，成为工人群众参加领导和管理企业的权力机构。工会通过各种活动，保证了国家加工订货任务的完成，改善了经营管理，推动了企业和资本家的改造；同时也保护了群众的民主权利和物质利益，受到了广大群众的热烈拥护。可惜后来大部分合营企业没有把工人群众参加管理的经验当作一个好传统继承下来。民主管理机构被取消了，而有些公方代表只是片面强调行政权力，遇事不找群众商量，以致许多工人群众对“企业主人翁”的地位发生怀疑，他们的积极性就降低了。而工会，由于不能或很少参与企业的领导和管理，也就丧失了或削弱了监督的作用。这样一来，就大大减弱了工会和群众的紧密联系。
    这样的情况是必须改变的。私营企业工人参加企业管理的民主传统不仅应当继承下来，而且应当发扬光大。工会的监督的权力应该恢复。在合营企业中应当建立民主管理机构，工会应当组织群众参加管理，负责进行建立民主管理机构的工作，并实现对行政管理工作的监督。目前，有的企业采用职工代表大会和管理委员会的组织形式参与企业管理，这是很好的。职工代表大会是由群众提名、普遍选举产生的职工代表所组成的；管理委员会则是由职工代表大会或全体职工大会选举产生的。在不违反上级行政的指示、命令的范围内，这些机构有权讨论厂内各种重大问题，建议行政执行；如果行政和管理委员会的意见不一致，可以报请上级行政和上级工会组织解决。有了这样真正具有权力的民主管理机构，就可以普遍发动群众的生产积极性，同时防止官僚主义对工人权益的损害。工会组织应当积极努力，在合营企业中贯彻民主管理的原则，配合行政更好地完成社会主义改造的任务。
    目前有一部分工人群众和一些工会干部对党的和平赎买政策，特别是对赎买政策中的一些具体措施还理解得不够清楚，他们认为“太便宜了资本家”了，因而心里不大服气。工会组织应当对所有公私合营企业的职工群众进行一次有关赎买政策的广泛解释，使他们了解：改造资本家成为自食其力的劳动者，需要有个准备过程，我们虽然付出一部分代价，但却使资本家不加抵抗地放弃了剥削制度，并参加到社会主义方面来，这是工人阶级的胜利。
    今天，资本家在企业中已经具有一般工作人员的身份了。工会组织今后应当加强对他们的工作，更多地争取他们参加劳动竞赛，支持他们的正确意见，鼓励他们的进步方面，批判他们的错误思想和行为。改造资本家是一个长期的复杂的任务。
    资本家中绝大多数的人在安排工作以后都是积极努力、诚恳地接受社会主义改造的；但也有极少数的人消极怠工、贪污营私，工会组织有责任在企业中团结职工群众，发扬正气，阻遏消极因素的滋长。
    过去，工会在依靠积极分子发动群众、保证完成国家的加工订货任务等方面都创造了很好的经验，今后应当继续发扬这种创造精神，充分发挥自己在社会主义改造和社会主义建设中的作用。
