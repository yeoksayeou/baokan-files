Xinhua News Agency, November 5th. The Second Plenary Session of the First Central Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association (CDNCA) opened in Beijing today. 154 Central Committee members attended the meeting, with another 165 people attending as observers.

Huang Yanpei, Chairman of the CDNCA, delivered the opening speech. He said that the central topic of this meeting is to review the work of the CDNCA over the past year or so and to formulate the guiding principles and tasks for the current work.

Huang Yanpei said that since the First Plenary Session of the First Central Committee of the CDNCA until now, the CDNCA has done a lot of work and the organization has grown significantly. Although there are still many shortcomings in our work, it can be affirmed that the political line of the CDNCA is correct. Significant achievements have been made in cultivating and improving industrialist and businessman members to become the backbone of the industrial and commercial circles and in playing an active role in the socialist transformation work.

Huang Yanpei pointed out that the holding of this meeting is at a time when fundamental changes are taking place in our country's political and social life. The current new situation requires the CDNCA to continue to cultivate more backbone members from the industrial and commercial circles, and to more widely connect with the masses in the industrial and commercial circles, work hard in production, and play its due active role in the final completion of the socialist transformation work and mutual supervision. Furthermore, it should unite more closely with the people of the whole country around the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government, heighten vigilance, and strive to defend our socialist cause and world peace.

Huang Yanpei emphasized that the ownership of the means of production by capitalists has not been completely eliminated. Capitalists have not yet truly become self-reliant laborers in the true sense of the word. The socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce in our country has not yet completed its final step. The main task of the CDNCA at present is to assist the government in uniting and educating industrialists and businessmen to properly complete this final step, and to ensure that the completion of this task truly reaches the stage of "maturity comes naturally, and success comes when conditions are ripe."

Huang Yanpei said that this task is very glorious and also extremely arduous. To successfully complete this task, we must mobilize all positive factors within the CDNCA, overcome various difficulties, and sincerely accept the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and strengthen the unity of comrades within the association.

Li Zhuchen, Vice Chairman of the CDNCA, delivered a work report on behalf of the Standing Committee of the CDNCA. His report discussed the achievements, shortcomings, existing problems, and work experience of the CDNCA over the past year.

In order to hold the Second Plenary Session well, the Standing Committee of the CDNCA invited Central Committee members who were originally in Beijing and those who had recently arrived in Beijing to hold fifteen consecutive sessions of the Central Standing Committee (expanded) meetings and several group discussions over nineteen days from October 11th to October 29th. It initially reviewed the work of the past year and put forward preliminary opinions on the guiding principles and tasks of the CDNCA's current work. At the same time, it reviewed and discussed several problems that had been left over from the past and that currently existed among the members of the Central Standing Committee, and carried out criticism and self-criticism. Decisions were made on several specific issues under discussion. In addition, the Central Standing Committee also put forward some arguments on several major principle issues, and submitted them to the Second Plenary Session for deliberation.

    中国民主建国会一届二中全会开幕
    新华社5日讯　中国民主建国会第一届中央委员会第二次全体会议，今天在北京开幕。出席会议的有中央委员一百五十四人，另有一百六十五人列席了会议。
    中国民主建国会主任委员黄炎培在会上致开幕词。他说，这次会议的中心议题是检查民建过去一年多的工作，并且制定了当前工作的方针任务。
    黄炎培说，从民建第一届中央委员会第一次全体会议到现在的一年半时间内，民建做了不少工作，组织有了很大的发展，虽然我们在工作中还存在着不少缺点，但是完全可以肯定民建的政治路线是正确的。在培养和提高工商业者会员成为工商界中的骨干分子，在社会主义改造工作中起积极的作用等方面取得的成绩是显著的。
    黄炎培指出，我们这次会议的举行，正处在我国国内的政治生活和社会生活发生根本变化的时期。当前新的形势，要求民建继续培养更多的工商界的骨干分子，而且更广泛地联系工商界群众，努力生产，在最后完成社会主义的改造工作和互相监督的工作中，发挥其应有的积极作用。并且和全国人民一道，更加紧密地团结在中国共产党和中央人民政府的周围，提高警惕，为保卫我们的社会主义事业和世界和平而奋斗。
    黄炎培着重指出，资本主义的生产资料所有制还没有最后消灭。资本家也还没有真正成为名符其实的自食其力的劳动者。我国资本主义工商业的社会主义改造工作还没有走完它最后一步。民建当前的主要任务就是要协助政府团结教育工商业者妥善地走完这最后的一步，并使这项工作的完成，真正地达到“瓜熟蒂落，水到渠成”的地步。
    黄炎培说，这个任务是十分光荣的，也是异常艰巨的。要胜利完成这一任务，就要求我们调动民建内部一切积极的因素，克服各种困难，并且一定要真诚接受中国共产党的领导和加强会内同志的团结。
    中国民主建国会副主任委员李烛尘代表民建中央常务委员会，在会上作了工作报告。他的报告谈到了一年多来民建工作中的成就、缺点、存在的问题和工作经验。
    民建中央常务委员会为了开好二中全会，曾邀集原来在北京和新近到北京的中央委员从10月11日到10月29日的十九天中连续举行了十五次中央常务委员会（扩大）会议和若干次的分组讨论，初步检查了一年多来的工作，并提出了民建当前工作的方针任务的初步意见。同时还对中央常务委员中过去遗留的和现在存在的若干问题进行了检查、讨论，展开了批评和自我批评。对讨论中的若干具体问题作出了决定。另外对若干主要原则问题，中央常务委员会也提出了一些论点，提请二中全会审议。
