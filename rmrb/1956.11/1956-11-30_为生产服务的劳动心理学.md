    Labor Psychology Serving Production
    Li Jiazhi, Associate Researcher, Institute of Psychology, Chinese Academy of Sciences
    Labor psychology is a branch of psychology. In theory, it studies the role of labor in the occurrence and development of human consciousness, and the characteristics and laws of human psychological activities in the labor process. In practice, it studies how to use the characteristics and laws of human psychological activities in labor to directly serve the cause of production and construction. This article only introduces some of the work that has been and may be carried out in practice.
    I. Research on fully utilizing human sensation and perception abilities. Labor is inseparable from human sensation and perception. On the one hand, labor often promotes the development of human sensation and perception abilities to a higher level; on the other hand, labor activities, both qualitatively and quantitatively, depend on the sensitivity and accuracy of sensation and perception. Therefore, artificially improving human sensation and perception abilities is naturally an important issue in labor psychology. Soviet psychologists have made brilliant research achievements in this area. Take the study of night vision as an example. At night, when we go from a bright room to a dark courtyard, it takes a considerable amount of time to see something. This process is called dark adaptation. We are able to see objects at night mainly by relying on the rod cells on the retina. Soviet scientists have discovered that the rod cells and cone cells on the retina can affect each other. Using red light, which has little effect on rod cells, to stimulate cone cells can accelerate the process of dark adaptation. This principle was applied in World War II, that is, pilots on night duty must wear red glasses in brightly lit rest rooms, so that they can see things quickly when they go into the dark in an emergency and quickly perform take-off missions.
    Visual sensitivity is also controlled by the higher parts of the central nervous system. Using the interaction of analyzers and the method of conditioned reflexes can both increase or decrease the level of sensitivity. More importantly, Soviet psychologists, based on Pavlov's theory of the two signal systems, specifically proved the positive role of human consciousness in visual sensitivity. In experiments to check visual sensitivity, if language reinforcement is not used (that is, the subjects are not told the results of each experiment), although after many practices, the level of sensitivity of the subjects does not increase much. If language reinforcement is applied, and the subjects are told before the experiment that the illumination used in the experiment will be greatly reduced, the visual sensitivity of the subjects can be increased to more than ten times the original level. This shows how huge the potential ability of human sensation is, and also shows the huge role of human consciousness in exerting this potential ability.
    Consciously perceiving some stimuli related to labor can improve people's perception ability. The meaning of learning and training lies in this. Anti-aircraft sentry soldiers can learn to judge the distance, speed, type, and even the number of enemy aircraft by sound. Soviet psychologists improved workers' perception ability of small time distances and improved the production efficiency of precision grinding bearings, which is also a good example. Experienced machine workers often use special sounds or vibrations to judge the operating conditions of the machine, but they often neglect to pass on this valuable experience to young workers.
    In order to fully utilize human sensation and perception abilities, labor psychology studies the characteristics of human sensation and perception in order to find ways to change external stimulus conditions so that they are suitable for the characteristics of human sensation and perception. Take hearing as an example. There are different characteristics between hearing sounds and understanding languages. Loudness, pitch, individual signals or composite signals, quiet environment or noisy environment all have various effects on human hearing sensitivity and differentiation ability and the ability to understand languages. The design of navigation equipment, transmitters, and some other telecommunications equipment, if combined with psychological research on the characteristics of hearing, can make the design more perfect. Labor psychology has a wider range of research on visual stimulus conditions. Taking visual stimuli related to safety as an example, human eyes have different sensitivity to different colors of light. Therefore, what brightness, color, and contrast should be used for many safety signals and markings to be most easily noticed and seen clearly from a distance is also a question that requires psychological research. The research on tactile stimuli closely related to labor tools has also been applied, so I will not give examples here.
    With the continuous development of production technology, the conditions on which human labor activities depend are becoming increasingly complex. Many stimuli related to changes in labor objects and production processes are not easily and accurately sensed by humans, or cannot be sensed at all, so instruments are needed. However, the instrument itself still needs to be sensed, understood, and judged by humans. How the form, indication, arrangement, etc. of the instrument are most suitable for human perception and differentiation ability, and how to avoid illusions or misidentifications, are new questions raised to labor psychology by modern production technology, especially aviation technology. Soviet psychologists have studied the most favorable conditions for perceiving instrument indications, and psychologists in capitalist countries have been and are still conducting a large amount of research on instruments in aircraft cockpits. These studies have made important contributions to improving production efficiency and avoiding flight accidents.
    II. Research on Labor Operation Activities. Labor activities are inseparable from human psychological activities. Sechenov believed that human psychological processes start with sensations caused by external stimuli, continue to be active in the brain, and end with external muscle activities. Pavlov further developed Sechenov's ideas, and his dynamic stereotype and two signal systems theory opened up the path for scientific research on complex issues such as skilled skills and the role of consciousness in labor. We only take the most common rhythmic activity in modern industrial production as an example to illustrate the relationship between psychological activities and labor operations.
    Rhythmic activities are repetitive movements, and are also relatively easy and efficient activities. However, workers are also quite nervous in the initial learning stage. He must know a certain working method and the purpose to be achieved, must always pay attention to many relevant stimuli from labor objects, tools, and machines, and must also pay close attention to his own movements. Obviously, in this initial learning stage, the activities of the human brain, especially the second signal system activities closely related to consciousness, play a very important role in the operation activities. Because these stimuli and the worker's own movements always appear repeatedly, a dynamic stereotype is gradually formed in the human brain activity. Once the dynamic stereotype is consolidated, a main link in the external stimulus system can trigger a series of conditioned reflex activities. Therefore, skilled workers do not have to always pay attention to all external stimuli, and sometimes can complete certain operations without using vision, but mainly relying on tactile and muscle movement sensations. That is to say, the first signal system activity takes the advantage in the operation activities, and the thinking activity related to the second signal system can have more time to consider other issues. This is of course very beneficial to production activities.
    However, in rhythmic activities, especially in simple and rapid rhythmic activities, the weakening of the control of the second signal system can also produce adverse consequences. The operation activities of old-style punch presses often make it difficult for workers to cope with sudden changes in the production process. Sometimes the hand feeding the material has not had time to withdraw, but the worker involuntarily steps on the machine. This causes serious accidents. Long-term monotonous stimuli can cause the human brain activity to turn into an inhibited state, making people feel sleepy. This is also detrimental to production activities. Dynamic stereotypes also have a certain stubbornness. The change of the old operating method will initially cause some difficulties for workers, which will temporarily reduce production efficiency. Workers who have learned the new operating method sometimes make old movements because of carelessness or excessive tension. The difficulties encountered by pilots when changing aircraft types are exactly the same reason. In production activities, the appearance of old movements may cause defective products, damage tools, or cause accidents. Consolidated dynamic stereotypes may also be damaged by some adverse factors. Such as high temperature, fatigue, sudden loud noises, bad emotions, etc., all have adverse effects on human brain activity, especially on the second signal system activity, thus destroying the skilled skills that have been mastered. In some factories, the increase in the accident rate in July, August, and September is mostly related to the abnormality of the coordinated work of the first and second signal systems.
    Labor psychology research on skilled skills is not limited to rhythmic operation activities. Different forms of operation activities also show some special and common psychological activity laws in the process of their formation, consolidation, transformation, and destruction. These characteristics and laws can be used to help solve a series of problems in labor operations. Take the formation of skills as an example. Some labor activities require workers to observe a certain situation on the one hand, and also require him to make appropriate operation activities on the other hand. Then, is visual help needed when training workers to learn this type of operation activities? Experiments and practice have proved that for this type of work, learning without visual assistance is slower in the initial stage of training, but progress is very fast later; while learning with visual assistance is faster in the initial stage of training, but it often stays at a lower level later, and even cannot work without the help of vision. If you develop the habit of looking at the keyboard when learning to type in Western languages, it is difficult to reach the standard of an ordinary typist; if you develop the habit of looking when shifting gears when learning to drive a motorcycle, you cannot become a qualified driver. Some principles that have been discovered in labor psychology research on the formation of skills can play a guiding role in production teaching. Some principles of labor psychology on the transformation of skills are directly related to the improvement of operation methods, and some principles on the destruction of skills can help analyze the causes of accidents and suggest measures to prevent accidents. In recent years, Soviet psychologists have conducted a lot of research on the formation and transformation of skills in different occupations, and the labor psychology of the German Democratic Republic attaches great importance to the analysis and prevention of production accidents. Their research results are valuable data that we should learn from.
    III. Research on Creative Labor Activities and Summarization of Advanced Production Experience. Human labor activities transform nature, and also transform oneself, making one's brain and thinking activities continuously develop, and the brain and thinking activities in turn make people carry out more complex activities. This development process also includes the creative labor process. Creative labor should be the central issue of labor psychology research, but the current level of labor psychology cannot clearly describe the characteristics and laws of the creative thinking process. The proposal of Pavlov's two signal systems theory opened up an end for the scientific research on human thinking activities. At present, thanks to the research work of Soviet scientists, we have gradually understood the relationship between the development of the motor analyzer and the development of language, and the relationship between language and the second signal system. In order to lay the scientific research foundation of creative thinking activities, this experimental research work should be vigorously carried out. From another perspective, people are always social, and labor is always social labor. Therefore, researching human creative labor should pay attention to social constraints. Moreover, people have language and can report their creative thinking processes; people have activities and the results of labor. Therefore, analyzing and summarizing the creative activities and achievements of advanced producers, and studying the conditions on which creative labor depends and the processes and laws of creative thinking activities from specific facts should also be one of the research methods of labor psychology. The broad scope of modern social production determines the richness and diversity of advanced production experience. Therefore, summarizing advanced production experience requires the help of technologies and theories from many scientific departments. Labor psychology can also play an active role in analyzing and summarizing advanced experience. For example, in many rhythmic works, advanced producers often regularly overfulfill tasks due to some reasonable minor movements. However, what are the advantages of his operation activities, many people, even the advanced producer himself, often cannot realize. Labor psychology attaches great importance to analyzing minor movements in operation activities, studying the sequentiality and coordination of these movements, affirming the reasonable parts, and improving the unreasonable parts to make operation activities more economical and perfect. The "motion and time study" is widely used in the industry of capitalist countries to analyze operation activities. One of its methods is to use movies to analyze minor movements. The advantage of this method is that it allows us to repeatedly analyze and study operation activities. As a tool for analyzing rapid operation activities, this method can be applied. However, the so-called "efficiency engineers" in capitalist countries only care about eliminating redundant movements without considering the reasons for the movements and the impact on people after the movements are eliminated, which is completely unacceptable.
    The superiority of some advanced experience lies in the fact that they are suitable for human psychological characteristics, and labor psychology can help summarize these advanced experiences. Let us give an example about stereoscopic perception. The reason why we can see the uneven road surface in front of us when we walk is because we have stereoscopic perception. The production of stereoscopic perception depends on many conditions, one of which is the relationship between different brightness and darkness on the surface of the object. When the sun's light is nearly perpendicular to the mountain road surface, the car driver feels particularly strenuous. The reason is that many shadows on the road surface disappear, and the driver's ability to distinguish unevenness is difficult. Knowing the relationship between light and dark and stereoscopic perception, we can consider many issues related to stereoscopic perception in labor activities, and seek better ways to use stereoscopic perception. For example, illuminating the surface of a thin metal plate with light at an appropriate angle can clearly reveal some defects on the surface, thereby improving the quality and speed of inspection work. Although we have not read theoretical reports about Li Juying's "oblique light cloth inspection method" in Shanghai, we can imagine that it should also be in line with the principle of stereoscopic perception. Many advanced experiences related to psychology, because they mostly come from people's daily lives, seem very ordinary and are considered to be natural. Therefore, failing to investigate the principles in them hinders the promotion of advanced experience. The task of labor psychology is to raise these ordinary experiences to a theoretical level.
    IV. Research on Human Ability Issues and Career Selection. Different production labors require different human abilities to complete, and human abilities have individual differences. How to guide young people to learn a suitable technology or choose a suitable career according to the requirements of the profession and the characteristics of individual abilities is a real problem. Capitalist countries have a large number of psychologists engaged in the research of so-called "psychological tests" or "psychological selection." In addition to their purposes of excluding foreign races, eliminating older workers, and strengthening exploitation, their views and research methods are also incorrect. They cut off the individual's historical, social, and educational background to treat individual differences, and even in the same person, they often attempt to isolate and study a part of human ability. For example, they once believed that the speed of human response to stimuli is related to the pilot's driving performance. Therefore, when selecting pilots, measuring human reaction time has become one of the important items in psychological tests. However, decades of accumulated facts have proved the error of their hypothesis. Human reaction time depends on the stimulus conditions and the functional state of the human cerebral cortex. Isolating and testing reaction time cannot draw correct conclusions. Soviet psychologists, based on Pavlov's theory, led the research of individual differences onto the correct path, that is, to deeply study the physiological basis of individual differences - the type of nerve activity - from the perspective of human basic nerve processes. At the same time, Soviet psychologists also pointed out that nerve types also develop and change in the process of life and education. Moreover, the defects in one aspect of a person's ability can be compensated by the abilities in other aspects. More importantly, political enthusiasm and communist moral qualities can maximize the individual's abilities, and sometimes enable people to accomplish tasks that seem impossible. Therefore, examining and cultivating young people's abilities and love for their majors should take all these factors into account. However, this is a very complex issue, and research in this area is one of the directions that labor psychology will strive for in the future.
    At present, labor psychology cannot solve all the problems related to human psychological activities in labor activities, but labor psychology can solve some problems about sensation, perception, and activities, and has accumulated a lot of research results. The foundation of labor psychology in our country is very weak, but there is considerable strength in the research of individual aspects such as sensation, perception, and activities. The problem is how to organize forces, strengthen learning, go deep into practice, and strive for the support and cooperation of relevant departments and scientific research institutions. In the future, under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, our psychology workers will definitely contribute their strength to production and will achieve brilliant results.

    为生产服务的劳动心理学
    中国科学院心理研究所副研究员　李家治
    劳动心理学是心理学的一个部门。在理论方面，它研究劳动对于人的意识的发生和发展的作用，研究劳动过程中人的心理活动的特点和规律；在实践方面，它研究如何利用人在劳动中的心理活动的特点和规律直接为生产建设事业服务。本文仅对实践方面已经和可能进行的一些工作作一介绍。
    一、充分发挥人的感觉、知觉能力的研究。劳动同人的感觉、知觉有不可分离的关系。一方面，劳动经常促使人的感觉、知觉的能力向更高的水平发展；另一方面，劳动活动无论在质的方面或量的方面都有赖于感觉、知觉的敏锐性和正确性。因此，以人为的方法提高人的感觉、知觉的能力，自然是劳动心理学中的重要问题。苏联心理学家在这方面有辉煌的研究成就。现以夜视觉的研究为例。在夜间，我们从光亮的房间走到黑暗的院子，经过相当长的时间才可以看见一些东西。这一过程叫作暗适应。我们在夜间所以能够看到物体，主要是依靠网膜上的棒体细胞。苏联科学家们发现，网膜上的棒体细胞和椎体细胞是可以相互影响的；利用对棒体细胞很少起作用的红光来刺激椎体细胞，可以加速暗适应的过程。这一原理在第二次世界大战中得到了应用，即值夜班的飞行员在灯光明亮的休息室内必须戴红眼镜，以便在紧急情况下走到黑暗中即可看到东西，迅速执行起飞任务。
    视觉感受性也是受中枢神经系统的高级部分所支配的。利用分析器的相互作用和条件反射方法，都可以提高或降低感受性的水平。更重要的是，苏联心理学家根据巴甫洛夫的两种信号系统学说，具体地证明了人的意识对于视觉感受性的积极作用。在检查视觉感受性的实验中，如果不用语言强化（即把每次实验结果告诉被试者），虽然经过多次练习，但被试者的感受性水平提高的并不多；如果应用语言强化，并且在试验前告诉被试者，实验所用的照明将大大降低，被试者的视觉感受性可以提高到原始水平的十倍以上。这说明人的感觉有多么巨大的潜在能力，也说明人的意识对于发挥这种潜在能力的巨大作用。
    有意识地去感知同劳动有关系的一些刺激物，是可以提高人的感知能力的。学习和训练的意义也在于此。防空哨战士可以学会凭声音来判断敌机的距离、速度、机种甚至架数。苏联心理学家改善工人对于微小时间距离的知觉能力而提高精磨轴承的生产效率，也是很好的例子。有经验的机器工人往往会利用特殊的声音或振动判断机器运转的情况，可是他们往往忽略把这种宝贵的经验传授给青年工人。
    为了充分发挥人的感觉、知觉的能力，劳动心理学研究人的感觉和知觉的特点，以便设法改变外界刺激条件，使它们适合于人的感觉和知觉的特点。以听觉为例。人听声音和听懂语言有不同的特点。响度、音高、单独的信号或复合的信号、安静环境或噪音环境，对于人的听觉感受和分化能力和理解语言的能力发生多种多样的影响。导航设备、传话器和一些其他电信用具的设计如果同心理学对于听觉特点的研究配合起来，可以使设计更趋于完善。劳动心理学对于视觉刺激条件研究的范围更广。以有关安全的视觉刺激物来说，人的眼睛对于不同颜色灯光的感受能力是不同的，因而许多安全信号和标记等要采用什么明度、颜色和对比才最容易惹人注意并使人从远处就可以看清楚，也是需要心理学的研究的。关于同劳动工具有密切联系的触觉刺激物的研究也得到了应用，这里就不举例叙述了。
    随着生产技术的不断发展，人的劳动活动所依赖的条件也日趋复杂化。许多同劳动对象和生产过程的变化有关的一些刺激物是人不容易精确感觉到的，或者根本不能感觉到的，因而需要仪表。但是，仪表本身仍然需要人来感知、理解和判断。仪表的形式、示度、安排等等怎样才最适合于人的感受和分化能力，怎样才可以避免发生错觉或错误的辨别，是现代生产技术，尤其是航空技术向劳动心理学提出的新问题。苏联心理学家曾经研究感知仪表示度的最有利的条件，资本主义国家的心理学家对于飞机驾驶舱里的仪表曾经并且仍在进行着大量的研究工作。这些研究已经对于提高生产效率和避免飞行事故作出了重要的贡献。
    二、劳动操作活动的研究。劳动活动是同人的心理活动分不开的。谢琴诺夫认为，人的心理过程是由外界刺激所引起的感觉开始，在大脑中继续活动，而以外部的肌肉活动为结尾。巴甫洛夫进一步发展了谢琴诺夫的思想，他的动力定型和两种信号系统学说，为熟练技能以及意识在劳动中的作用这样复杂的问题开辟了科学研究的道路。我们仅以现代工业生产中最常见的节奏性活动作为例子，来说明心理活动同劳动操作的关系。
    节奏性活动是一些重复性的动作，也是较容易而效率较高的活动。可是，工人在初学阶段也是相当紧张的。他必须知道一定的工作方法和将要达到的目的，必须时刻注意来自劳动对象、工具和机器等方面的许多有关刺激，也必须十分留心他自己的动作。显然，在这种初学阶段，人脑的活动，尤其是同意识密切联系着的第二信号系统活动，在操作活动中占非常重要的地位。由于这些刺激和工人自己的动作总是反复地出现，人的大脑活动就逐渐形成了一种动力定型。动力定型一经巩固，外界刺激系统中的一个主要环节就可以引起一系列的条件反射活动。因此，熟练工人不必经常注意所有外界刺激，有时甚至不用视觉而主要依靠触觉和肌肉运动感觉，就可以完成某些操作活动。这就是说，第一信号系统活动在操作活动中占了优势，而同第二信号系统相联系的思维活动可以有更多的时间考虑其他问题。这对于生产活动当然是非常有利的。
    但是，在节奏性活动中，特别是在简单而迅速的节奏性活动中，第二信号系统控制作用的减弱也会产生不良的后果。旧式冲床的操作活动，往往使工人难于应付生产过程中的突然变化；有时进料的手还没有来得及退出，而工人却不由自主地踏动了机器。这就造成了严重的事故。长期的单调刺激可以使人的大脑活动转入抑制状态，使人感到困倦。这也是对生产活动不利的。动力定型还具有一定的顽固性。旧的操作方法改换，最初会使工人遇到一些困难，从而会使生产效率暂时降低。已经学会了新操作方法的工人，有时候因为不留心或过度紧张又会作出旧的动作。飞行员更换机种时所遇到的困难正是这种原故。在生产活动中，旧动作的出现可能产生废品、损坏工具或造成事故。巩固的动力定型也可能因一些不良因素而遭受破坏。如高温、疲劳、突然的大声、不良的情绪等等，对于人脑的活动、尤其是对于第二信号系统活动都会发生不良的影响，因而破坏已经掌握了的熟练技能。在一些工厂中，七、八、九月份的事故发生率的增加，就多半是同第一、第二信号系统协调工作的失常有关的。
    劳动心理学关于熟练技能的研究，并不止于节奏性操作活动一种。不同形式的操作活动，在它们的形成、巩固、改造和破坏过程中，也会表现一些特殊的和共同的心理活动规律，这些特点和规律可以用来帮助解决劳动操作中的一系列的问题。以技能的形成为例。有些劳动活动一方面要求工人的眼睛观察某种情况，另一方面还需要他作出适当的操作活动，那末，在训练工人学习这一类操作活动时是否需要视觉的帮助呢？实验和实践证明，对于这一类的工作，不利用视觉的学习在训练初期是比较慢些，但是以后进步很快；而利用视觉的学习在训练初期虽然比较快，但是以后往往停留在较低的水平，甚至脱离视觉的帮助就不能工作。学习西文打字如果养成用眼看键盘的习惯，很难达到一个普通打字员的标准；学习驾驶摩托车如果养成换挡时用眼看的习惯，也不能成为有资格的驾驶员。劳动心理学关于技能的形成的研究中已经发现的一些原理，对于生产教学是可以起指导作用的。劳动心理学关于技能的改造的一些原理同改进操作方法有直接关系，关于技能的破坏的一些原理可以帮助分析事故的原因，建议防止事故的措施。近年来，苏联心理学家对于不同职业中的技能的形成和改造问题进行了不少研究工作，德意志民主共和国的劳动心理学对于生产事故的分析和防止的研究非常重视。他们的研究成果正是我们应当学习的宝贵资料。
    三、创造性劳动活动的研究和总结先进生产经验。人的劳动活动改造着自然，也改造着自己，使自己的脑和思惟活动不断地发展，而脑和思维活动又转来使人进行更复杂的活动。这种发展过程也就包括着创造性劳动过程。创造性劳动应当是劳动心理学研究的中心问题，但是目前劳动心理学的水平还不能清楚地叙述创造性思惟过程中的特点和规律。巴甫洛夫的两种信号系统学说的提出，为科学地研究人的思惟活动开了一个端。目前，由于苏联科学家的研究工作，我们已经逐渐了解运动分析器的发展同语言发展的关系，以及语言同第二信号系统之间的关系。为了奠定创造性思惟活动的科学研究基础，这种实验研究工作是应当大力进行的。从另一方面看，人永远是社会性的，劳动也永远是社会劳动，因此，研究人的创造性劳动应当重视社会制约因素。并且，人有语言，可以报告自己的创造性思惟过程；人有活动，有劳动的成果。因此，分析和总结先进生产者的创造性的活动和成果，从具体的事实中研究创造性劳动所依赖的条件和创造性思惟活动的过程和规律，也应当是劳动心理学研究方法之一。　　现代社会生产的广阔范围，决定了先进生产经验的丰富和多样，因而总结先进生产经验需要许多科学部门的技术和理论的帮助。劳动心理学对于分析和总结先进经验也可以起积极作用。例如，在许多节奏性的工作中，先进生产者往往由于一些合理的微小动作而经常超额完成任务。但是，他的操作活动的优点何在，许多人、甚至连先进生产者本人也往往觉察不到。劳动心理学很重视分析操作活动中的微小的动作，研究这些动作的顺序性和协调性，肯定其中合理的部分，改善不合理的部分，使操作活动更经济、更完善。资本主义国家工业中普遍应用“动作同时间的研究”来分析操作活动，其方法之一是用电影来分析微小的动作。这种方法的优点在于它可以使我们对操作活动反复地分析和研究。作为分析迅速的操作活动的工具，这种方法是可以应用的。但是，资本主义国家的所谓“效率工程师”只管消除多余的动作而不考虑动作产生的原因和动作消除以后对于人的影响，是完全要不得的。
    有些先进经验的优越性在于它们适合于人的心理特点，劳动心理学可以帮助总结这些先进经验。我们举一个关于立体知觉的例子。我们走路时所以能够看出眼前的高低不平的路面，是由于我们有立体知觉。立体知觉的产生依赖许多条件，其中之一就是物体表面的不同明暗的关系。当太阳的光线同山坡公路路面近于直角时，汽车驾驶员感到特别吃力，原因就是路面上的许多阴影消失了，驾驶员辨别高低不平的能力发生了困难。知道了明暗同立体知觉的关系，我们就可以考虑劳动活动中许多有关立体知觉的问题，并寻求更好地利用立体知觉的办法。例如，以适当角度的灯光照射金属薄板的表面，可以使表面上的一些缺点清楚地显露出来，这样就可以提高检验工作的质量和速度。关于上海李菊英的“斜光查布法”，虽然我们还没有读到理论性的报道，但是我们可以想见它也应该是符合于立体知觉的原理的。许多同心理学有关系的先进经验，因为多半是从人的日常生活中来的，所以看来很平凡，被认为是当然的，因而不究明其中的道理，这就妨碍了先进经验的推广。劳动心理学的任务就是要把这些平凡的经验提高到理论的水平。
    四、人的能力问题的研究和职业选择。不同的生产劳动需要人的不同的能力来完成，而人的能力是有个别差异的。如何根据职业的要求和个人能力的特点来指导青年学习一种适当的技术，或选择一种适当的职业，是一个现实的问题。资本主义国家有大批心理学家从事所谓“心理测验”或“心理选择”的研究。除了他们的排斥异族、淘汰年长工人和加强剥削的目的以外，他们的观点和研究方法也是不正确的。他们割断了个人的历史、社会和教育背景来对待人的个别差异，即便在同一个人身上，也往往企图把人的一部分能力孤立起来进行研究。例如，他们曾经认为，人对于刺激的反应的快慢同飞行员的驾驶成绩有关。因此，在选择飞行员时，测量人的反应时间就成了心理测验中的重要项目之一。但是，数十年来累积的事实证明了他们这个假设的错误。人的反应时间是依赖刺激条件和人的大脑皮质的机能状态而变化的，孤立地测验反应时间是不能得出正确的结论的。苏联心理学家根据巴甫洛夫学说，把个别差异的研究引上了正确的途径，即从人的基本神经过程方面深入研究个别差异的生理基础——神经活动类型。同时，苏联心理学家也指出，神经类型也是在生活和教育过程中发展和变化的。并且，人的一方面能力的缺陷，可以为其他方面的能力所补偿。更重要的是，政治热情、共产主义的道德品质，可以使个人的能力尽量发挥，有时使人能够完成似乎不可能完成的任务。因此，考查和培养青年人的能力和对于专业的爱好，应当估计到所有这些因素。但是，这是一个非常复杂的问题，这方面的研究工作是劳动心理学今后努力的方向之一。
    目前，劳动心理学还不能解决劳动活动中一切同人的心理活动有关系的问题，但是关于感觉、知觉和活动的一些问题，劳动心理学是能够解决的，并且已经累积了不少研究成果。我国劳动心理学的基础十分薄弱，但是，对于感觉、知觉、活动等个别方面的研究，也是有相当的力量的。问题在于如何组织力量、加强学习、深入实践，以及争取有关部门和科学研究机构的支持和合作。今后，在中国共产党和人民政府的正确领导下，我国心理学工作者一定将会为生产贡献出自己的力量，并将获得辉煌的成绩。
