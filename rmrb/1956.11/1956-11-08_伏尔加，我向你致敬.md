    Volga, I Salute You
  　Zhiren
    My friend—dear Volga, I first met you in the classroom of middle school. You travel from the White Sea to the Caspian Sea, bringing the cold water of the Arctic to the subtropical south. You nurture the vast lands and their masters. You send the grains and treasures of the south to the north. Moscow is above your head, and the Lenin Volga-Don Canal is at your feet. My young heart has long yearned to meet you.
    Today, my wish has come true. I have come into your embrace as a student of your simple and honest people. You have changed. You are more beautiful, and I cannot look at you with the knowledge I gained in the middle school classroom.
    Volga, heroic Volga, you once used your body to block the enemy. The Hitler bandits collapsed at your feet. Stalingrad will forever bear witness to you: the war left it with only two houses. But what about now? Now it stands majestically before me as a modern city. I can no longer compare it to the Stalingrad described by Simonov in "Days and Nights." Tall buildings have been erected here. How excited I am! I am inspired by the strength of the Soviet people, which is contained in these buildings and at the same time embodied by them. Because it is a heroic city, and also a city under construction, with huge crane frames standing like ladders in the sky above every corner of the city.
    Volga, you have nurtured countless heroic sons and daughters. Chernyshevsky was born beside you, as he described in his autobiography; our human conscience and genius—dear Lenin—was also born beside you, and founded the Marxist group here; the heroic Frunze made Kolchak fall forever beside you; Gorky experienced his "Childhood" and "My Universities" beside you....
    You have vast grasslands, and enduring camels trek on your shores; along your right bank are mountains, with black gold in the mountains, green forests on the mountains, and rare birds and animals in the forests. Natural gas from Saratov has traveled thousands of miles through underground pipelines to Moscow; the oil here also flows continuously; and a new workers' city—Komsomolsk—has appeared in the valley.
    Volga, how many miracles have you created! Huge ships climbed mountains eighty-eight meters higher than you in your torrents, then crossed this mountain and climbed down forty-four meters into the Don River. The people wanted you to change your course a little, and you generously rewarded them with billions of kilowatts of electricity.
    Many new cities will also appear beside you. Kazan will no longer be just the capital of the republic with ancient palaces, it will become a huge seaport for ocean vessels.
    The nights on the Volga are particularly unique. The sparkling and colorful beacons, sluices, and power stations decorate you like a living fire dragon, which reminds me of the dragon lanterns of our Chinese Lantern Festival, but you are not just a dragon lantern, you are a huge living dragon that benefits the people. You also remind me of my mother—the Yellow River and the Yangtze River. You smile at me and say: don't worry, they will be as beautiful as I am, and my people will help you.
    Volga, thank you! My dear friend! We Chinese people sing your praises and cherish you like your people. For your honor, please accept the salute of a Chinese student!
                                     In Moscow

    伏尔加，我向你致敬
  　直人
    我的朋友——亲爱的伏尔加，还在中学的教室里我就与你相识了。你从白海到里海，把北极的冷水带到亚热带的南方。你哺育着万顷的土地和它的主人。你把南方的粮食和宝藏送给了北方，你头上有莫斯科，你脚下有列宁伏尔加河—顿河运河。我年青的心啊，早就向往着和你相会。
    今天，我的愿望实现了，我来到你的怀中，作为你淳朴人民的学生。你已变了样，你更加美丽了，完全不能让我用中学教室里的知识来看你了。
    伏尔加，英雄的伏尔加，你曾用身体阻挡了敌人，希特勒匪徒就在你的脚下溃败了，斯大林格勒将永远给你作见证：战争只给它留下两所房屋。然而现在呢？现在它却以现代化城市的姿态雄壮地挺立在我面前。我不能再用西蒙诺夫在“日日夜夜”里描写过的斯大林格勒来比较了，这里已竖起了高楼。我是多么激动啊！我为蕴藏在这些建筑物里的，同时又为它们所体现着的苏联人民的力量所鼓舞。因为它是英雄的城，也是建设中的城，巨大的起重机架正像天梯一样的耸立在城市的各角落的上空。
    伏尔加，你养育了无数英雄儿女，车尔尼雪夫斯基出生在你身旁，他曾在自传里描述过；我们人类的良心和天才——亲爱的列宁也生在你身旁，并在这里创立了马克思主义小组；英勇的伏龙芝曾在你身边让高尔察克永远地倒了下去；高尔基却在你的身边经历了“童年”和“大学”的生活……。
    你有广阔的草原，具有耐力的骆驼跋涉在你的岸上；沿着你的右岸尽是山岭，山里有黑金，山上有绿林，林里有奇禽异兽。萨拉托夫的天然煤气经过千万里地下输管跑到了莫斯科；这里的石油也源源的流着；新的工人城市——共青团城就出现在山谷里。
    伏尔加，你做出了多少奇迹啊！巨大的船只在你的洪流中爬上了高于你八十八公尺的山丘，然后翻过这山丘爬下四十四公尺进入顿河。人民要你改动一下路，你就慷慨地把亿万瓩的电赏给了他们。
    在你身旁也将出现许多新的城市。喀山将不再是只有古老宫殿的共和国的首都，它将成为一个巨大的海轮的港口。
    伏尔加的夜晚，显得特别别致。闪烁着的多采的标灯、水闸、电站把你装饰得活像一条火龙，这不禁让我想起我们中国的元宵节的龙灯，但你不仅是龙灯，你是为人民造福的巨大的活龙。你也使我想起了我的母亲——黄河和长江，你微笑着对我说：不要着急，他们将和我一样的美丽，我的人民会帮助你们。
    伏尔加，感谢你！我的亲爱的朋友！我们中国人像你的人民一样地歌颂你，爱护你，为了你的荣誉，请接受一个中国学生的敬礼！
                                     于莫斯科
