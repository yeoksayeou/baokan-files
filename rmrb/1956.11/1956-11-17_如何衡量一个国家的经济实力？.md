    How to Measure a Country's Economic Strength?
    The Soviet journal "Economic Issues" published an article in its third issue of 1956 entitled "The Economic Competition Between Socialism and Capitalism" by V. Arkhipov and Ya. Kotkovsky. This article raises a very important question: how to determine a country's economic strength?
    The authors of this article believe that the indicators for measuring a country's economic strength are the absolute quantity of production and the per capita output, and they put forward the latter as the main indicator. The article states: "A country's economic strength depends not only on the absolute quantity of production, but primarily on the per capita output. The higher the per capita output of industrial products, the stronger the country's economic strength and the higher the level of consumption." After this article was published, the Soviet journal "Kommunist" published an article by N. Baibakov in its sixth issue of 1956, "Important Issues in the Basic Economic Tasks and Long-Term Planning of the Soviet Union," which criticized the above point of view. Baibakov believes that the indicator for measuring a country's economic strength is the total volume of industrial production, rather than primarily depending on the per capita output. For example, the Soviet Union lags behind some developed capitalist countries in terms of per capita output of industrial products, but in terms of economic strength, the Soviet Union is the most powerful country in Europe and also a great industrial power in the world. For another example, Belgium, a small country with only nine million people, has the same per capita steel production as the United States, and more than one and a half times that of the United Kingdom and West Germany, but it cannot be said that Belgium's economic strength is equal to that of the United States, and exceeds that of the United Kingdom and West Germany. He said: "The more industrial production, especially the quantity of heavy industrial products per capita, the higher the level of economic development of the country, because this usually presupposes higher social labor productivity and a higher level of consumption. A country's economic strength is determined by the total output of industrial production."
    The ninth issue of the "Economic Issues" magazine in 1956 published a letter to the editor from Yu. Orishevich. He believes that the previous two articles took a mechanical approach to this issue. Orishevich believes that there are at least five indicators for measuring a country's economic strength, and they should be examined uniformly and not separated when comparing. The five indicators he cited are: (1) the total volume of production, taking into account the structure of production; (2) the per capita output; (3) the reserves of resources; (4) the speed of production growth; and (5) the country's position in the world economic system. He also specifically mentioned that when measuring the economic strength of imperialist countries, one should not only look at its own production, but also look at the country's position in the world capitalist economy. As for measuring the economic strength of a socialist country, its position in the world socialist economic system is also very important. Various indicators of the development of the world socialist economic system are also important indicators for measuring the economic strength of socialist countries cooperating with each other. Finally, he suggested that Soviet economists carry out a discussion on this issue. (Feng)

### 如何衡量一个国家的经济实力？

    如何衡量一个国家的经济实力？
    1956年第三期苏联“经济问题”杂志，刊载了弗·阿尔希莫夫、雅·柯特科夫斯基写的一篇论文：“社会主义同资本主义的经济竞赛”。这篇文章提出了一个非常重要的问题，即：如何确定一个国家的经济实力？
    这篇文章的作者认为衡量一个国家经济实力的标志是生产的绝对数量和按人口计算的产品量，而且把后者作为主要的标志提出来。这篇文章说：“一个国家的经济实力不仅取决于生产的绝对数量，而且首先取决于按人口计算的产品量。按人口计算的工业品产量越高，则国家的经济实力就越强，消费水平也越高。”这篇文章发表后，苏联“共产党人”杂志于1956年第六期刊载了尼·拜伊巴可夫的“苏联的基本经济任务和远景规划的重要问题”一文，对于上述论点提出了批评。拜伊巴可夫认为衡量一个国家的经济实力的标志是工业生产的总量，而不是首先取决于按人口计算的产品量。例如，苏联在按人口计算的工业品产量方面还落后于一些发达的资本主义国家，然而按经济实力来说，苏联却是欧洲最强大的国家，同时也是世界上伟大的工业强国。又如只有九百万人口的小国比利时，按人口计算，钢的产量同美国相等，比英国和西德多半倍以上，但不能因此就说比利时的经济实力同美国相等，并超过英国和西德。他说：“工业生产，特别是按人口计算的重工业产品数量越多，这个国家的经济发展水平就越高，因为这通常要以更高的社会劳动生产率和更高的消费水平为前提。一个国家的经济实力决定于工业生产的总产量。”
    1956年第九期“经济问题”杂志发表了尤·奥里谢维奇给编辑部的来信。他认为前面的两篇文章对于这个问题持了机械的态度。奥里谢维奇认为衡量一个国家的经济实力的标志至少有五种，而且在比较时不能分割开来，应统一地加以考察。他举的五种标志是：（一）生产的总量并考虑到生产的结构；（二）按人口计算的产品量；（三）资源的储备；（四）生产增长的速度；（五）这个国家在世界经济体系中的地位。他还特别提到在衡量帝国主义国家经济实力时，不仅看它本国的生产，而且应该看这个国家在世界资本主义经济中所占的地位。至于衡量一个社会主义国家的经济实力，那么它在世界社会主义经济中所占的地位也是非常重要的。世界社会主义经济体系发展的各种指标，也就是衡量彼此合作的社会主义国家经济实力的重要标志。最后，他建议苏联经济学家开展这一问题的讨论。（峰）
