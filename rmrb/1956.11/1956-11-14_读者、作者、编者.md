    A Discrepancy with the Party Constitution

    In my article "Allowing Party Members Who Have Made Mistakes to Defend Themselves," published on page four of the People's Daily on October 25th, the first sentence "The Party Constitution stipulates: When a Party organization discusses and decides on disciplinary action against a Party member, the Party member being disciplined should be notified to attend the meeting and defend themselves, except in special circumstances" was incorrectly printed as "...except in special circumstances of the individual, the disciplined member should be notified to attend the meeting and defend themselves." This is not only grammatically incorrect, but also differs from the provisions of the Party Constitution. This error should not have occurred at all. (Qian Wenjian)

    Editor's Note: Comrade Qian Wenjian's opinion is correct. This error was due to negligence during the typesetting and proofreading process.

    Opinions on the Article "Consistency of Learning and Application"

    After reading the "Reader Q&A: Does This Count as Consistency of Learning and Application" on page two of the People's Daily on October 10th, I felt that some of the arguments in the article were not accurate enough. For example, the article mentions "Those who study mechanical engineering going to light industrial factories... as long as they truly undertake technical work, it is not only not inconsistent with learning and application, but is also reasonable and necessary at present." This statement is not accurate enough. It should be stated as: "In order to meet the needs of industrial construction, the inability to achieve complete consistency between learning and application is still unavoidable and necessary for the time being."

    At the same time, referring to "mechanical engineering" in such a general way is not clear enough. Because the mechanical engineering department is divided into many specialties, and each specialty is its own "industry," the mechanical engineering department itself includes many "industries."
    (Cheng Gaotong, Zeng Kenian, Dong Dinghui, et al.)

    Newspapers and Periodicals Should Not Arbitrarily Create Simplified Characters

    Recently, many newspapers and periodicals have shown a phenomenon of arbitrarily creating simplified characters and not paying attention to the use of punctuation marks. For example, in the People's Daily, August 3rd, seventh edition, in the article "The 'Hundred Schools of Thought Contending' in the Spring and Autumn and Warring States Periods," one instance of the character "龙" (dragon) was mistakenly written as "尨". Also, in magazines such as Science Pictorial, Comic Strip Pictorial, Popular Cinema, and Literary Studies, the character "无" (without) is sometimes simplified to "?", but according to the regulations for simplified Chinese characters, it should be "无".

    In addition, we have found cases of lines starting with commas or periods in newspapers and periodicals such as China Youth Daily and New Observer. However, the "Usage of Punctuation Marks" promulgated by the former Publications Administration prohibited such usage. We hope that the People's Daily and other newspapers and periodicals will pay attention to this issue.

      It's Steelmaking, Not Refining Methods

    On page two of the People's Daily on October 25th, there was a news item titled "Anshan Iron and Steel's First Steel Plant Produces More Than Two Thousand Heats of Rapid Steelmaking." This sentence is not grammatically correct, because "rapid steelmaking" is only a method; it cannot be "produced." What is produced can only be steel. It should be "using the rapid steelmaking method to produce more than two thousand heats of steel."
              (Song Chengze, Nanjing)

    Please Write Your Name and Address Clearly

    Some of the manuscripts received by this newspaper's editorial department do not have addresses or have unclear addresses, and some do not have the author's name or have unclear names, and some only have an illegible "signature" at the end of the manuscript. This has caused difficulties for the editorial department in handling the manuscripts. We hope that authors will write their names and addresses clearly when submitting manuscripts in the future.

    读者、作者、编者
      同党章的规定有了出入
    我写的“允许犯错误的党员进行申辩”一稿，已在人民日报10月25日第四版上刊载。但是这篇稿子的第一句“党章规定：党的组织讨论和决定对于一个党员的处分，除了特殊情形以外，应当通知受处分的本人到会，进行辩护”错成了：“……除了本人特殊情况以外，应当通知受处分的到会，进行辩护”。这样不仅字句不通，而且同党章的规定有了出入。这种错误，是完全不应当有的。（钱文剑）
    编者按：钱文剑同志的意见是对的。这个错误的产生是排校过程中的疏忽所致。
    对“学用一致”一文的意见
    读了10月10日人民日报二版答读者问“这算不算学用一致”，觉得文中有些论点不够确切。如文中谈到“学机械的到轻工业工厂里去，……只要是真正担负技术工作，不但不是学用不一致，而且在目前来说，是合理的，也是必要的”。这种说法是不够确切的。应该说成：“为了满足工业建设的需要，学用不能完全一致，暂时还是难以避免的，也是必要的”。
    同时，这样笼统地提个机械系，也提得不够明确。因为机械系分很多专业，每一个专业就是一个“行”，机械系本身就包括了很多“行”。
    （程高桐、曾克念、董定慧等）
    报纸刊物不要滥造简体字
    近来不少报刊有滥造简体字和不注意标点符号用法的现象。例如：人民日报8月3日第七版“春秋战国时代学术上的‘百家争鸣’”一文中“龙”字有一个错为“尨”。又如科学画报、连环画报、大众电影、文艺学习等杂志上，有的地方把“无”字简成“?”，按照简化汉字的规定应当是“无”。
    另外，我们在中国青年报、新观察等报刊上发现有一行字的开头用逗号或句号的情况。而过去出版总署公布的“标点符号用法”是不准这样使用的。希望人民日报和其他报刊都能注意这个问题。

      是炼钢，不是炼方法
    10月25日人民日报第二版有一则消息，标题是“鞍钢第一炼钢厂炼出二千多炉快速炼钢”。这句话是不通的，因为“快速炼钢”只是一种方法，它不能被“炼”出来，被炼出来的只能是钢。应该是“用快速炼钢法炼出二千多炉钢”。
              （南京　宋成泽）
    请作者把姓名和地址写清楚
    本报编辑部收到的稿件，有些没有地址或地址不清楚，有些没有作者名字或名字不清楚，有的只在稿件最后有一个看不清楚的“签名”。这给编辑部处理稿件时带来了困难。希望作者们今后投稿时把自己的名字和地址写清楚。（编者）
