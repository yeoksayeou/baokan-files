    Locals Can't Buy Local Goods
    In recent years, some commercial departments, focusing only on outward shipments during procurement and neglecting local needs, have created an abnormal phenomenon: "Locals can't buy local goods."
    Zibo's porcelain and glassware, and Zhoucun's silk are famous throughout the country. Glassware was once even popular abroad. However, in recent years, high-quality, exquisite porcelain and glassware produced locally cannot be found in local markets; only defective and third- or fourth-grade products are available. A store that previously sold high-end glassware has even switched to selling coarse porcelain. The quantity of Zhoucun silk, which comes in over a hundred colorful patterns, is of excellent quality, and is popular among the masses, sold locally has also decreased, and the products available are often seconds.
    Supplying other regions should be guaranteed, but the needs of the local people should also be taken into consideration. ·Li Xun·

### 当地人买不到当地货

    当地人买不到当地货
    某些商业部门在收购工作中只顾外运，不管当地，近几年来产生了一种不正常的现象——“当地人买不到当地货”。
    淄博市的陶瓷器、玻璃料器和周村丝绸是全国驰名的。玻璃料器还曾畅销国外。但是，近几年来，当地市场上就买不到当地生产的细致的上等陶瓷器和玻璃料器，能买到的只是一些残次货和三等、四等货。原先一家经营高级料器的商店也改为经营粗料瓷器。周村一百多种花色鲜艳、品质优良、颇受广大群众欢迎的丝绸，在当地出售的数量也越来越少，而且是一些次品。
    对外地的供应是应当保证的；但是，也应当照顾到当地群众的需求。　·李汛·
