Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, 26th. Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier He Long today spent the fifth - and last - day of their visit to Cambodia visiting the important Cambodian fishing town of Beang Khnar.

Beang Khnar is seventy kilometers northwest of Phnom Penh. They arrived in this fishing town at 1 p.m. aboard a Cambodian Royal Navy vessel. Prince Sihanouk, Prince Penn Nouth, Prime Minister San Yun and Royal Army Chief of Staff Lon Nol accompanied them.

When they boarded the ship in front of the Royal Palace at seven o'clock this morning, the Royal Guards saluted with swords and the Royal Band played music. As the ship sailed along the Mekong River tributary, the 800-meter-wide Tonle Sap River, tens of thousands of residents from villages and towns on both banks gathered to welcome Premier Zhou Enlai and his entourage. Cambodian and Chinese national flags were erected along the river. Villagers and townspeople held dugout canoe races.

As the ship approached Beang Khnar, forty small yachts sailed over to welcome the distinguished guests, while 15,000 people on the shore and on the boats waved flags and cheered loudly. The fishing town has only 1,500 residents; the rest came from cities and villages in three provinces.

Premier Zhou Enlai and Prince Sihanouk boarded a sampan and then went to the platform on the shore to meet the welcomers.

Premier Zhou Enlai delivered a brief speech. He said that such a grand welcome would forever remain in his memory. "Upon returning home, I will bring your friendship to the Chinese people." As Prince Sihanouk verbally translated Premier Zhou Enlai's speech into Cambodian, each sentence caused the cheering crowd to erupt with joy. Premier Zhou Enlai concluded by shouting in Cambodian "Long live Cambodian-Chinese friendship! Long live Prince Sihanouk!" This elicited prolonged cheers and applause, and a folk band on a beautifully decorated dragon boat played beautiful music.

The party boarded a sampan and sailed to a nearby spot where fishermen were fishing and catching lobsters. The fishermen presented Premier Zhou Enlai with two carp, each weighing thirty kilograms.

The Premier and the Prince then boarded a floating platform, which was decorated with colorful awnings, verdant foliage, and flags. The Governor of Kampong Chhnang Province and officials from the province presented the Premier with gifts on the platform. At this time, dozens of small boats competed in front of the floating platform. The rowers were dressed in yellow, red, white, or black clothing. These boats presented an extremely beautiful scene as they moved back and forth on the river. The Premier presented awards to the winning rowing athletes.

As the party boarded the navy ship and started the return journey, the small boats and many sampans and sailboats gathered to see them off. When they returned to the Cambodian capital in the evening, the tens of thousands of electric lights decorating the outside of the Royal Palace were lit, and the Royal Guards raised their weapons to salute them.

    柬埔寨之行的第五天
    周总理和贺副总理访渔镇
    新华社金边26日电　周恩来总理和贺龙副总理今天用他们的柬埔寨之行的第五天——也是最后一天的时间访问了柬埔寨重要的渔镇贝昂希腊累。
    贝昂希腊累在金边西北七十公里。他们在下午一时乘柬埔寨皇家海军的船只到达这个渔镇。西哈努克亲王、宾努亲王、桑云首相和皇家陆军参谋长朗诺和他们同行。
    当他们在今天早晨七点钟在王宫前面上船的时候，皇家卫队举剑致敬，皇家乐队演奏了音乐。当船只沿着湄公河支流、八百公尺宽的沙河驶行的时候，河流两岸的村镇的成千成万的居民都聚拢来欢迎周恩来总理和他的随行人员。河边竖立着柬、中两国国旗。村民和市民们举行了独木舟比赛。
    船只驶近贝昂希腊累的时候，四十只小游艇划过来欢迎贵宾们，同时在岸上和船上的一万五千人挥舞着旗帜，高声欢呼。这个渔镇只有一千五百人，其余的人是从三个省的城市和乡村来的。
    周恩来总理和西哈努克亲王坐上舢板，然后走到岸上的台子上去和欢迎者会面。
    周恩来总理发表了简短的讲话。他说，这样盛大的欢迎将永远留在我的记忆中。“在回国时，我将把你们的友谊带给中国人民。”当西哈努克亲王把周恩来总理的讲话口头译成柬埔寨语的时候，每一句话都使得欢呼的人群欢腾起来。周恩来总理最后用柬埔寨语高呼柬中友谊万岁！西哈努克亲王万岁！这引起了长时间的欢呼鼓掌，在一艘装饰得很华丽的龙船上的一支民间乐队奏起了美妙的音乐。
    这一行人登上了舢板，驶到附近的一个地方去，渔民正在那里捕鱼和捕龙虾。渔民送给周恩来总理两条鲤鱼，每条重三十公斤。
    总理和亲王然后登上了一个浮台，上面装饰着彩色的篷子、翠绿的树叶和旗帜。磅清扬省省长和这个省的官员们在台上向总理赠送了礼物。这时，数十只小船在浮台前面进行了比赛。划船的人都穿着黄、红、白或黑色的衣服。这些小船在河上来回划动的时候，呈现出一幅极其优美的景象。总理向比赛获胜的划船运动员授了奖。
    当这一行人登上海军船只走上回程的时候，这些小船和许多舢板、帆船都围拢来送别。在他们傍晚返回柬埔寨首都的时候，王宫外面装饰的成千上万的电灯都亮起来，皇家卫队都举起武器向他们致敬。
