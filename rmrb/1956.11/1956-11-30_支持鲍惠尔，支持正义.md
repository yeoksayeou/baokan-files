Support Powell, Support Justice
Chen Hansheng

Today, in the cause of promoting mutual understanding among the people of all countries and safeguarding world peace, there is a major obstacle. That is, the American people are severely hindered from obtaining accurate information about socialist countries and anti-colonial countries. The American people are even less allowed to criticize their government's series of erroneous policies based on facts, especially the policy of hostility towards the new China and the occupation of China's territory of Taiwan. This makes it impossible for the American people to make accurate judgments on issues of great importance to peaceful coexistence, international friendly cooperation, and to themselves.

This deliberately created obstacle is the domestic Cold War in the United States. A recent example is the persecution of American Powell, his wife Sylvia, and his assistant Schuman, who worked in journalism in our country for many years, on the trumped-up charge of "sedition." Why are these three people being persecuted? Because when they were editing the English "China Weekly Review" (later renamed "China Monthly Review"), they boldly published some articles reporting the truth about the new China, the Korean War, and the national independence movements in Asian countries.

According to American law, the crime of sedition can only be constituted during a time when the United States is participating in a war. However, Powell and others were falsely accused simply because they published documents about the Korean War, and the U.S. government has always claimed that their aggression against Korea was a "police action." At that time, President Truman used this excuse to launch the war immediately without Congress passing a declaration of war. But now, in order to try Powell and others, the U.S. government claims that the war of aggression against Korea has always been based on law.

The intention of this trial is too clear. It is to intimidate journalists so that they dare not criticize or censure the U.S.'s aggressive policies. Because all such censure or criticism will be interpreted as "sedition" and can be used to convict them. If Britain were to do the same, then today the "Manchester Guardian" would also be guilty of "sedition," because this newspaper, although without any leftist tendencies, has pointed out that the British government's actions in Egypt are aggressive.

Currently, the United States is attempting to influence countries that have close relations with it in various aspects such as economy, law, and culture, so that these countries will follow the Cold War policy. The influence of American policies on other capitalist countries is not small. This is manifested in all aspects. Therefore, the Powell case goes far beyond the United States and becomes a case that should be of concern to the whole world.

Today, the significance of this case lies not so much in the false accusation against Powell and his wife and Schuman, saying that they should not have published materials and news unfavorable to the aggressors during the war of aggression against Korea. The main significance lies in the fact that the U.S. government wants to take this opportunity to warn other American journalists, intimidate them, and not allow them to publish news and opinions that criticize U.S. policies; to use this to make people know that the U.S. government will use all means to block the American people's concern and attention to the new China. People can still remember the incident this summer when the U.S. government prohibited American journalists from coming to the new China for visits. At that time, personnel from several American news agencies, newspapers, and radio stations were willing to visit the new China, and our government had granted them entry visas, but the U.S. government stated that if they came to China, they would violate "laws and regulations that violate government policy" and face five years in prison.

Powell and his wife are full of a sense of justice and dare to resist the U.S. government's persecution of them. They have repeatedly stated that they will continue to write and speak to let the American people know the truth about what they have seen and heard in China. On April 27 this year, they issued a declaration saying: "We have lived in China for fifteen years and believe that we have some understanding of the situation and historical changes in China. Since we are experienced and conscientious journalists, we must of course report and express our opinions based on facts. We must continue to write and say what we have seen in China. Although our opinions are very different from those of the members of the U.S. Congress who favor the Chiang Kai-shek clique, and although they do not allow us to oppose the fallacy of so-called Taiwan representing China, we still insist on the duty of American citizens to report what we have personally seen."

It can be seen from this that the key issue is not the editorials they wrote six or seven years ago, but mainly their attitude and actions today. It is precisely because they have the courage to express their views, dare to promote friendship and peace, and report the positions and opinions of the Asian people that they are being persecuted.

Under the oppression of reactionary politics, the struggle to defend justice and truth requires not only courage but also overcoming various difficulties. Today, the highest legislative and administrative institutions in the United States are occupied by reactionaries. The U.S. government has also promulgated many laws and regulations that violate the constitution to destroy democratic and progressive groups and public opinion. In recent years, many democratic and progressive groups have been dissolved under this oppression.

However, the vast majority of the people in the United States love truth, fairness, and freedom, but they dare not openly express their views. Strong public opinion from all countries must support these people and encourage them to oppose the persecution of Powell and his wife and Schuman.

World public opinion must make the U.S. government feel that if it continues to wage a Cold War at home, it will become increasingly isolated. We Chinese people have many relatives and friends overseas. If we write to them and tell them how Powell and his wife and others are being persecuted in the United States, and the significance of this case, they will promote democratic public opinion in various places and condemn American tyranny.

We should tell everyone that freedom of speech is the foundation of all freedoms. This has been incorporated into the Charter of the United Nations. If Powell and his wife and Schuman are convicted of "sedition" because they reported what they personally observed, published documents they believed to be true, and criticized their government's Far East policy, then freedom of speech in the United States is just an empty phrase. Fighting for freedom of speech is our common goal and the responsibility of the whole world. We must do our best to prevent the forces that persecute human rights from succeeding in this case.

    支持鲍惠尔，支持正义
    陈翰笙
    今天，在各国爱好和平人民努力增进各国相互了解、保卫世界和平的事业中，存在着一个很大的障碍。那就是美国人民受到严重的阻挠，不能获得关于社会主义国家和反殖民主义国家的真实消息。美国人民更不能被容许根据事实来批评他们政府的一系列的错误政策，特别是敌视新中国、霸占中国的领土台湾的政策。这就使得美国人民对于和平共处、国际友好合作以及对他们自己有重大关系的问题，不能作真确的论断。
    这种故意造成的障碍，也就是美国国内的冷战。最近的一个例子是用“煽动叛乱”的莫须有的罪名，迫害曾经在我国从事新闻工作多年的美国人鲍惠尔、他的妻子锡尔维亚和他的助理舒曼。为什么他们三人要被迫害呢？因为他们在编辑英文“密勒氏评论报”（后改为“中国每月评论”）的时候，曾经大胆地刊载了一些报道关于新中国、朝鲜战争和亚洲各国民族独立运动真相的文章。
    按美国的法律，只有在美国参加战争的时期内才能构成煽动叛乱的罪名。可是鲍惠尔等所以被诬告，只是因为他们发表了关于朝鲜战争的文件，而美国政府一向宣称他们侵略朝鲜是一种“警察行动”。当时杜鲁门总统利用这个借口，不经国会通过宣战案而马上发动战争。但现在因为要审判鲍惠尔等，美国政府又宣称侵朝战争是一直有法律根据的。
    这次审判的用意太清楚了。就是要恫吓新闻界人士，使他们不敢对美国的侵略政策有所指摘或非难。因为所有这种非难或指摘都会被解释为“煽动叛乱”，并可据以判罪。假使英国也这样搞的话，那末今天“曼彻斯特卫报”也犯了“煽动叛乱”的罪，因为这个报刊虽然毫无左倾嫌疑，但指摘了英国政府在埃及的行动是侵略性的。
    目前美国正企图在经济、法律、文化等各方面影响同它有密切关系的国家，使这些国家追随冷战的政策。美国的政策对其它资本主义国家的影响是不小的。这在各方面都表现出来。所以，鲍惠尔案件远超出美国的范围，而成为全世界所应关怀的案件。
    今天这个案件的意义，主要的还不在诬告了鲍惠尔夫妇和舒曼，说他们不该在侵朝战争时期发表不利于侵略者的资料和消息。主要的意义在于美国政府要借此警告其它美国新闻记者，恫吓他们，不许他们发表批评美国政策的消息和意见；要借此使人们知道，美国政府不惜用一切手段来遮断美国人民对新中国的关怀和注意。人们还能记得，今年夏季美国政府禁止美国新闻记者前来新中国访问的事件。那时有好些美国通讯社、报馆、广播电台的人员愿意到新中国来访问，我国政府已给予入境签证，但美国政府声明如果他们来华就要违反“违反政府的政策法令”而坐牢五年。
    鲍惠尔夫妇富于正义感，敢于反抗美国政府对他们的迫害。他们屡次声明，他们要继续写作并演讲，要使美国人民知道他们在中国所见所闻的实情。今年4月27日他们发表了一个宣言说：“我们曾居留中国十五年之久，自问对中国情况和历史转变有些认识。既然我们是有经验，有良心的新闻记者，我们当然要根据事实作报道，并发表意见。我们一定要继续写出和说出我们自己在中国所见到的事情。尽管我们的意见和美国国会中袒护蒋介石集团的议员大不相同，尽管他们不许我们反对所谓台湾代表中国的谬论，我们还是要坚持美国公民的职责，来报道我们所亲自见到的事情”。
    由此可见关键问题并不在于六七年前他们所写的社论，而主要在于他们今天的态度和行动。正因为他们有勇气表达他们的见解，敢于宣传友好和平，报道亚洲人民的立场和舆论，他们才被迫害。
    在反动政治的压迫下，维护正义和真理的斗争，不但需要勇气，而且还要克服多种的困难。今天美国的最高立法和行政机构，都被反动派所盘据。美国政府又颁布了好些违反宪法的法令，来摧残争取民主和进步的团体和舆论。近年来，许多争取民主和进步的团体已经在这种压迫下被解散了。
    可是，美国国内绝大多数的人民是热爱真理、公平和自由的，只是不敢公开表达他们的主张。各国强有力的舆论必须支援这些人们，使他们鼓起勇气来反对对鲍惠尔夫妇和舒曼的迫害。
    世界的舆论必须使美国政府感觉到，如果它继续在它国内进行冷战，就会愈来愈孤立。我们中国人民在海外有许多亲戚和朋友。如果我们写信给他们，告诉他们鲍惠尔夫妇等在美国如何受迫害，和这个案件的意义，他们就会在各地发扬民主舆论，责斥美国的暴政。
    我们应当告诉大家，言论自由是各种自由的基础。这曾经载入联合国宪章。假使鲍惠尔夫妇和舒曼三人，因为他们报道了亲自观察的事情，发表了他们所认为真确的文件，并批评了他们政府的远东政策，而被判决犯了“煽动叛乱”的罪，那言论自由在美国只不过是一句徒然好听的空话罢了。为言论自由而奋斗，这是我们大家共同的目标，也是全世界的责任。我们必须尽力阻止迫害人权的势力在这个案件上得逞。
