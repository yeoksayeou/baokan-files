    Ginseng in the Changbai Mountains
    Tang Baoshun
    There are many types of ginseng in China, including Jilin ginseng, Liaodong ginseng, Bianjiang ginseng, and Shizhu ginseng, totaling more than twenty varieties. Some are wild, and some are cultivated artificially. The Changbai Mountain area in Jilin Province produces the most ginseng, accounting for over 90% of the country's total output of wild and cultivated ginseng.

    Various myths and legends about ginseng have circulated among the Chinese people, and in the past, it was regarded as a treasure that "ordinary people" could not obtain. Now, if you visit the state-owned ginseng farm in Fusong County, Jilin Province, in June or July, you can see the blooming ginseng flowers in the gardens. Here, the rare wild ginseng has long been transformed into a large-scale cultivated crop – cultivated ginseng.

    Wild ginseng is originally a perennial herbaceous plant that grows in the forest. Why does it prefer to grow in the forest? Because it is afraid of strong sunlight and cannot withstand heavy rain, only under large trees and on shady slopes is its most suitable growing place. When the morning sun rises and the evening sun sets, it absorbs the mild sunlight from the gaps in the forest to promote its growth. In July and August every year, ginseng blooms with purple-white flowers and bears bright red berries. At this time, because it is easily discovered, farmers near Changbai Mountain, in groups of three or five, carry their luggage, pots, and pans, and begin to go up the mountain to dig for ginseng. Some farmers, when looking for ginseng, habitually use sticks to knock on the tree trunks, partly to scare away poisonous snakes in the forest, and partly as a mark to contact their partners, so as not to get lost. Upon discovering a ginseng plant, they carefully dig, dig, dig, as meticulously as girls embroidering, afraid of touching even a single root or whisker. If they obtain a complete, top-grade, first-class ginseng, people's joy is truly indescribable. The growing period of this type of ginseng is more than several decades, and each tael (approximately 50 grams) is worth as much as one hundred and forty yuan. After the ginseng is dug out, it needs to be processed. The most common method is: to wash it carefully with water, boil it for a while, then add sugar juice and boil it for an hour, and then dry it in the sun. After processing, it becomes hard, translucent ginseng. If it is soaked in alcohol, it becomes ginseng wine.

    The reason why wild ginseng is so precious is mainly not because it is scarce and difficult to obtain, but because it has special medicinal effects. According to analysis, ginseng contains calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, vitamins A, B, and C, and many nourishing glycosides. After long-term medical application, it has been proven that ginseng has a sedative effect on the brain, it can directly promote the metabolism of human cells, and it can treat anemia, neurasthenia, and other diseases. Ginseng can also promote blood circulation. In short, it can make the human body strong and the spirit invigorated.

    In 1955, the Changbai Mountain area of Jilin Province produced more than 5,300 taels of this precious medicinal material, and more than 600 taels were sold abroad; however, it still could not meet the needs of domestic and foreign markets. In order to turn this rare wild medicinal material into large-scale production, according to a typical investigation in Fusong County, Changbai Mountain area, Jilin Province, experiments on artificial cultivation of ginseng began as early as three hundred years ago. People painstakingly studied, based on the growing conditions and characteristics of wild ginseng, repeatedly collected ginseng seeds from the mountains and sowed them in gardens, carefully cultivating them. After years of hard work, their wishes were realized. Now, many villages in Ji'an, Tonghua, Linjiang, Dunhua, and other counties in Jilin Province are artificially cultivating cultivated ginseng. There are also three state-owned ginseng farms in the province. Last year, Jilin Province produced more than 164,000 catties (approximately 82,000 kilograms) of finished cultivated ginseng. Although the medicinal efficacy of cultivated ginseng is lower than that of wild ginseng, the price per catty is only around twenty or thirty yuan, which is much cheaper than the price of wild ginseng. More than 15,000 catties of cultivated ginseng exported by Jilin Province last year have been well received in the international market. The mountainous and semi-mountainous areas of Jilin Province are the best places to develop cultivated ginseng. In order to prosper the mountain economy, the Jilin Provincial Department of Agriculture is currently planning to develop ginseng. (Image attached)

    长白山区的人参
    汤宝顺
    我国的人参品名很多，有吉林参、辽东参、边江参、石柱参等，不下二十多种；有野生的，也有用人工培植的。出产人参最多的地方是吉林省长白山地区，这里出产的山参、园参，占全国总产量的90％以上。
    在我国民间，曾流传过各种关于人参的神话故事，从前，人们把它看成了“凡人”不可索取的宝贝。现在，你如果能在6、7月间到吉林省抚松县国营参场去参观一下，便可以在园地里看到盛开的人参花朵。这里早已经把稀有的野生的山参，变成大量发展的园艺作物——园参了。
    山参，原来是森林中的多年生宿根性植物。它为什么偏要长在森林里呢？因为，它既怕强烈的阳光照，又经不起暴雨的侵袭，只有大树底下和荫坡，才是它的最适宜的生长地方。当朝阳东升和夕阳西斜的时候，它从林间空隙吸收温和的阳光来促进自己的成长。每年的7、8月间，人参开着紫白色的花朵，结着鲜红的浆果。这时因为他容易被人发现，长白山边的农民便三、五成群地背着行李、锅碗，开始上山挖参。有些农民在寻找人参的时候，惯常用棍棒敲打着树干，一方面惊跑森林中的毒蛇，一方面做为联络伙伴的标记，以免失踪。发现一苗人参，他们就小心翼翼地挖呀，挖呀，像姑娘们绣花那么细心，很怕触伤一根一须。如果得到一苗完整的特等一级人参，人们的欢乐心情真是无法形容。这种人参生育期都在几十年以上，每两价值一百四十元之多。人参挖出以后，需要加以调制。最常见的制法是：小心地用水洗净后煮一会，然后加上糖汁煮一小时，煮好后晒干。经过调制以后，便成了坚硬的、半透明的人参。如果用酒精浸制，就制成了人参酒。
    山参所以名贵，主要原因还不在于它少，索取不易，而在于它在医疗上有特殊效用。据分析，人参含有钙质、镁质、磷质，甲、乙、丙种维生素和滋补养身的配糖体很多。经过医药上长期间应用证明，人参对大脑有镇静作用，它可以直接促进人体细胞新陈代谢，可以治贫血、神经衰弱等症。人参又能促进血液循环。总之它能使人体力健壮，精神振奋。
    1955年吉林省长白山地区就出产这种珍贵药材五千三百多两，销售国外的就达六百多两；但仍不能满足国内外市场的需要。为了把这种稀有的生野药材变成大量生产，据吉林省长白山地区抚松县的典型调查，早在三百来年以前就开始了用人工培植人参的试验。人们苦心地钻研，根据山参的生育条件、特点，一次又一次地把人参的种籽从山上采集下来播种在园地里，细心培植。经过多年的艰苦劳动，愿望实现了。现在，吉林省的辑安、通化、临江、敦化等县许多村庄都用人工培植园参了。全省还有三处国营人参场。去年吉林省出产的园参成品，就有十六万四千多斤，园参比山参在医疗效能上虽然低些；但每斤价格只在二、三十元左右，比山参的价格便宜多了。吉林省去年出口的一万五千多斤的园参，在国际市场上曾得到好评。吉林省的山区和半山区是发展园参最好的地方。为了繁荣山区经济，吉林省农业厅，正在进行发展人参的规划。（附图片）
