Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 31st—The newly built No. 2 Steel Plant of Anshan Iron and Steel Complex overfulfilled its October production plan two and a half days ahead of schedule. The technical level of the steelworkers in this new steel plant is improving daily, and the output of steel is increasing month by month. The output of steel in October increased by ninety tons compared to September.
	During this month, the No. 2 Steel Plant held short-term study classes for open-hearth furnace foremen, steelworkers, and assistants, studying the experience of the employees of No. 10 open-hearth furnace in maintaining the furnace body and carrying out rapid steelmaking, which increased the number of rapid steelmaking furnaces from 61 in the previous month to 251. The average melting time for each furnace of steel was shortened by about 50 minutes compared to September, and a new national record was created for rapid steelmaking in large open-hearth furnaces, with one furnace of steel being made in five minutes and twenty-five seconds.
	Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 30th—The No. 5 automated blast furnace of the Anshan Iron and Steel Ironmaking Plant completed the October national plan one and a half days ahead of schedule. This blast furnace has been overfulfilling its task every month since July, and has now increased the production of pig iron for the country by more than 56,000 tons. The quality of the pig iron produced by this blast furnace is very good. The first-class product rate reached 97.6%. The No. 5 blast furnace has now become the best-producing blast furnace in the ironmaking plant.
	The production situation of this blast furnace was very bad in the first half of the year, and it failed to complete its task for three consecutive months. Starting in July, the employees of the No. 5 blast furnace formulated operating procedures and strictly followed the operating rules. They also learned from the advanced experience of No. 6 blast furnace in controlling furnace temperature and batching materials, and from No. 8 blast furnace in increasing wind temperature, raising the wind temperature to more than 940 degrees. In October, the utilization coefficient of this blast furnace reached about 0.673; the utilization coefficient in the same period last year was 0.817. Good results have also been achieved in reducing costs, saving more than 98,000 yuan in the third quarter; the situation of savings in October was even better than last month.

    炼钢工人技术水平日益提高
    鞍钢新建钢厂超额完成月计划
    五号高炉增产优质生铁五万多吨
    新华社鞍山31日电　鞍钢新建的第二炼钢厂，提前两天半超额完成了10月份生产计划。这个新的炼钢厂炼钢工人的技术水平日益提高，钢的产量也月月增加，10月份钢的产量比9月份增加了九十吨。
    在这个月里，第二炼钢厂举办了平炉工长、炼钢工、助手的短期学习班，学习了十号平炉职工维护炉体和开展快速炼钢等方面的经验，使快速炼钢炉数由上月的六十一炉，增加到二百五十一炉；每一炉钢的熔炼时间，平均比9月份缩短五十分钟左右，并且创造了用五点二十五分钟炼一炉钢的全国大型平炉快速炼钢最新纪录。
    新华社鞍山30日电　鞍钢炼铁厂五号自动化高炉提前一天半完成了10月份国家计划。这座高炉从7月份以来月月超额完成任务，到现在已经为国家增产了五万六千多吨生铁。这座高炉炼出来的生铁质量非常好。一级品率达到97.6％。五号高炉目前已成为炼铁厂生产最好的一座高炉。
    这座高炉在上半年生产情况很坏，曾经连续三个月没有完成任务。从7月份开始，五号高炉的职工们制订了操作规程，严格按照操作公约办事，并且学习了六号高炉控制炉温、装料批数和八高炉提高风温等先进经验，使风温提高到九百四十多度。10月份，这座高炉的利用系数达到了零点六七三左右；去年同期的利用系数是零点八一七。在降低成本方面，也做出了很好的成绩，第三季度节约了九万八千多元；10月份节约的情况，比上月还好一些。
