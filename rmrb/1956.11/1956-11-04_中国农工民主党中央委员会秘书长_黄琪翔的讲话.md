I, on behalf of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, express my utmost indignation and protest against the open armed aggression against Egypt by British and French colonialists; I express my firm support for the solemn statement issued by our government regarding the British and French armed aggression against Egypt; and I express my deepest sympathy and firmest support for the Egyptian people who are safeguarding national sovereignty and national independence!

Here, I want to solemnly warn the British and French colonialists that your heinous act of openly betraying the United Nations Charter and violating the principles of international law, infringing upon Egyptian territory and sovereignty, and imposing war on the Egyptian people, not only destroys peace in the Middle East, but also constitutes a serious provocation to peace-loving people all over the world! Your bellicose schemes and hideous faces have been completely exposed before the people of the world. The Egyptian people, who are adhering to their struggle for independence and safeguarding their territorial sovereignty, are united with all Arab countries and have gained the sympathy and support of the people of the world. You—the vile colonialists—will surely meet with a shameful defeat, and you have only one path: to immediately withdraw your armed forces from Egyptian territory!

The Egyptian people are suffering the hardships of war imposed on them by the imperialists. But, Egyptian brothers and sisters! You are by no means isolated. For the sake of defending your own territorial sovereignty and national independence, and for the sake of defending the sacred cause of peace, all peace-loving and justice-upholding countries and peoples in the world stand by your side, and the 600 million Chinese people are your staunch sympathizers and supporters. In these difficult years, we are your close friends and brothers; your pain is our pain, your struggle is our struggle. Justice will always belong to you, and you will surely be victorious!

Maintaining peace is the common cause of the people of the world, and opposing colonialism is the common will of the Asian and African countries participating in the Bandung Conference. We must not tolerate the imperialists launching wars of aggression to threaten peace. If the colonialists succeed in Egypt, it will not only be a defeat for the Egyptian people, but also a defeat for the cause of world peace, and even more so a defeat for the independence movements of Asian and African countries. However, we firmly believe that the era in which imperialists attempt to subdue peoples striving for national independence by force has gone forever. Japanese imperialism once frantically launched a war of aggression against our country, but after eight years of heroic resistance by our people, it was not the Chinese people who failed, but the Japanese imperialists; Hitler's German militarists also went to their graves. Today, the forces maintaining national sovereignty, striving for national independence, and defending peace are even stronger. If the British and French imperialists who launched the war of aggression are still obsessed with their errors, they will surely fail even faster.

People of the world who love peace, unite and resolutely oppose the predatory acts of the British and French imperialists! Long live the Egyptian people who are fighting to defend freedom and independence!

    中国农工民主党中央委员会秘书长
    黄琪翔的讲话
    我代表中国农工民主党，对英、法殖民主义者公然对埃及发动武装侵略的行为，表示万分的愤慨和抗议；对我国政府所发表的关于英、法武装侵略埃及的严正声明，表示坚决的拥护；对维护国家主权和民族独立的埃及人民表示最深切的同情和最坚决的支持！
    这里，我要郑重地警告英、法殖民主义者，你们这种公然背叛联合国宪章和违反国际法原则、侵犯埃及领土和主权、把战争强加于埃及人民身上的罪恶行为，不仅破坏了中东的和平，而且是对全世界和平人民的一种严重的挑衅！你们好战的阴谋和狰狞的面目，已经赤裸裸地在全世界人民的面前暴露无遗了。坚持自己的独立斗争和维护自己领土主权的埃及人民同全体阿拉伯国家团结在一起，已经得到了全世界人民的同情和支持。你们——万恶的殖民主义者，一定会得到可耻的失败，你们只有一条道路，那就是立刻从埃及领土撤退你们的武装！
    埃及人民正在蒙受着帝国主义者强加于他们身上的战争苦难。但是，埃及的兄弟姐妹们！你们决不是孤立的。为了保卫你们自己的领土主权和民族独立，为了保卫神圣的和平事业而战斗，全世界爱好和平、维护正义的国家和人民都是站在你们一边的，六亿中国人民是你们的坚决的同情者和支持者。在这个艰难的岁月里，我们是你们的亲密的朋友和兄弟，你们的痛苦就是我们的痛苦，你们的斗争就是我们的斗争。正义永远属于你们，你们一定胜利！
    维护和平是全世界人民共同的事业，反对殖民主义是参加万隆会议亚非国家的共同意志。我们决不能容忍帝国主义者发动侵略战争来威胁和平。如果殖民主义者在埃及得逞，那不仅是埃及人民的失败，而且也是世界和平事业的失败，更是亚非国家独立运动的失败。但是，我们坚信，帝国主义者企图用武力使争取民族独立的人民屈服的时代，已经永远一去不复返了。日本帝国主义曾经疯狂地发动过对我国的侵略战争，但经过我国人民八年的英勇抗战，失败的并不是中国人民，而是日本帝国主义者；希特勒德国军国主义者也同样走进了坟墓。今天，维护国家主权，争取民族独立和保卫和平的力量，已更为强大，发动侵略战争的英、法帝国主义者，如果仍执迷不悟，就一定会失败得更快。
    全世界一切爱好和平的人民团结起来，坚决反对英、法帝国主义者的强盗行为！为保卫自由和独立而战斗的埃及人民万岁！
