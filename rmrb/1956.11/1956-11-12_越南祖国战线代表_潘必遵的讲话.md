Dear friends,

As a Vietnamese citizen and an admirer of Mr. Sun Yat-sen, I feel extremely honored to attend the commemorative meeting for the 90th anniversary of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's birth held in Beijing today.

Mr. Sun Yat-sen's name is not unfamiliar to the Vietnamese people. He was a great patriot in Chinese history and a world-renowned nationalist revolutionary. He devoted forty years of struggle to overthrowing the feudal monarchy, which brought humiliation and loss of sovereign rights to the country, and to establishing a free, equal, and prosperous republic. In the days of the most arduous battles with the forces of darkness, his lofty revolutionary qualities of adhering to the revolutionary stand and being unyielding were the best example for the Vietnamese people in their long struggle against colonialism and for national independence.

The Xinhai Revolution led by Mr. Sun Yat-sen was a great revolution with world significance. It not only overthrew the feudal monarchy that had taken root in China for thousands of years and created a republic, but also had a profound impact on the national liberation movement throughout Asia. Taking Vietnam as an example, after the Xinhai Revolution, the Vietnamese people's struggle movement against French colonialists flourished wave upon wave. The victory of the Xinhai Revolution was an extremely powerful encouragement to the Vietnamese people's anti-imperialist and anti-feudal struggle.

Mr. Sun Yat-sen was not only a great patriot but also a great internationalist. In his will, in the political essays of his entire "Sun Wen Doctrine," and in his famous three major policies of "alliance with Russia, alliance with the Communist Party, and assistance to peasants and workers," one can understand his confidence in the victory of the socialist revolution and his policy of vigorously advocating assistance to small and weak nations in resisting oppression. I also remember that when he came to Vietnam to spread the revolution in 1907, he lived at 70 Zhongyao Street, Hanoi. At that time, progressive and patriotic people in Vietnam were founding a "Dong Kinh Nghia Thuc" (Tonkin Free School). It was an educational institution established in response to China's movement to abolish the imperial examination system, thereby propagating revolutionary ideas such as freedom and independence to the people. At that time, I was also a young teacher at the school. Mr. Sun Yat-sen, in his busy schedule, had several "pen talks" with the teachers of the school. His sincere sympathy for the Vietnamese people's resistance against colonialists, as well as his talks on caring for the development of Vietnamese national culture and education, were very touching. Although more than fifty years have passed, recalling the past now, his sincere attitude and lofty spirit of internationalism vividly appear before my eyes. Therefore, although Mr. Sun Yat-sen has left us, his immortal revolutionary spirit is deeply imprinted in the hearts of the Vietnamese people.

Today, I am participating in the commemorative meeting for the 90th anniversary of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's birth, and I feel extremely happy and excited. Because I have personally seen that the revolutionary ideals that Mr. Sun Yat-sen once aspired to but failed to realize have now been fully realized under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Government of the People’s Republic of China, and Chairman Mao Zedong. China has leaped from a backward and weak country to an advanced country in the world.

Today, commemorating the 90th anniversary of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's birth and cherishing the great contributions made by the revolutionary forerunner to the Chinese revolution and the Asian national liberation struggle, the Vietnamese people, like the Chinese people, will continue to learn from Mr. Sun Yat-sen's spirit of tirelessly struggling for the revolutionary cause throughout his life, and advance side by side in developing and consolidating the friendship between the Vietnamese and Chinese people and in the common cause of defending peace in Asia and the world.

The revolutionary spirit of Mr. Sun Yat-sen is immortal!

### 越南祖国战线代表  潘必遵的讲话

    越南祖国战线代表
    潘必遵的讲话亲爱的朋友们：
    我以一个越南公民和孙中山先生崇敬者的资格，今天怀着万分崇仰的心情来参加在北京举行的孙中山先生诞辰九十周年纪念大会，我感到有说不出的荣幸。
    孙中山先生的名字，对越南人民来说并不是陌生的。他是中国历史上伟大的爱国者，也是世界闻名的民族主义革命家。他为推翻丧权辱国的封建帝制，建立起一个自由、平等和繁荣的共和国而从事四十年的斗争。在和黑暗势力作最艰苦战斗的日子里，他那种坚持革命立场和不屈不挠的崇高的革命品质，是越南人民长期在反对殖民主义者，争取国家独立的斗争中最好的榜样。
    孙中山先生领导的辛亥革命是一个伟大的具有世界意义的革命。它不仅打垮了生根在中国几千年之久的封建帝制，缔造了共和政体，同时对整个亚洲的民族解放运动也发生了深刻的影响。就以越南来说吧，辛亥革命后，越南人民反抗法国殖民主义者的斗争运动是前浪推后浪地蓬勃发展起来。辛亥革命的胜利，对越南人民反帝反封建的斗争是一个极其有力的鼓舞。
    孙中山先生不但是一个伟大的爱国主义者，同时也是一个伟大的国际主义者。在他的遗嘱里，在整个“孙文学说”的政治论文中，在他著名的“联俄、联共、扶助农工”三大政策上，都可领会到他对社会主义革命胜利的信心和竭力主张扶助弱小民族反抗压迫的政策。我还记得，1907年他到越南传播革命时，曾住在河内市中药街七十号。那时越南的进步爱国人士正创办了一间“东京义塾”。它是一个响应中国废除科举的运动，从而向民众宣传自由、独立等革命道理而设立的教育机构。当时，我也是义塾里的一个年轻教员。孙中山先生在百忙中曾经和义塾里的教员进行过几次“笔谈”。他对越南人民反抗殖民主义者所表示的真诚的同情，以及关心越南民族文化教育发展的谈话，都令人十分感动。虽说事隔五十来年，而今一回忆起往事，他那诚挚的态度和崇高的国际主义精神，又栩栩如生地活现在我的眼前。所以说，孙中山先生虽然已离开了我们，但是他的不朽的革命精神却深深地烙印在越南人民的心里。
    今天，我参加孙中山先生诞生九十周年纪念大会，我感到无比的愉快和兴奋。因为我亲眼看到孙中山先生过去所抱负的、尚未能实现的革命理想，今天，在中国共产党、中华人民共和国政府和毛泽东主席的英明领导下，都已全部实现了。中国已由过去是落后的弱国一跃而为世界上先进的国家。
    今天纪念孙中山先生诞生九十周年，缅怀革命先行者对中国革命和亚洲民族解放斗争运动所作的巨大贡献，越南人民和中国人民一样会继续不断地学习孙中山先生毕生始终不懈为革命事业而奋斗的精神，在发展和巩固越中两国人民之间的友谊，在保卫亚洲和世界和平的共同事业中并肩前进。
    孙中山先生的革命精神永垂不朽！
