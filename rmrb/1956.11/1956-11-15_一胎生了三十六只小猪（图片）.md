    Thirty-Six Piglets Born in One Litter
    A sow in the Tuanjie (Unity) Advanced Agricultural Cooperative, Tangzhai Township, Dangshan County, Anhui Province, gave birth to thirty-six piglets in one litter in September. The piglets are all growing very well now.
    The person responsible for raising this sow is Dai Shixi, a representative of animal husbandry and veterinary workers in Anhui Province and a model breeder. He has more than twenty years of experience in raising sows. The method for raising this sow is: usually feed less refined feed and more roughage, and during pregnancy, let the sow go out for exercise frequently. Twenty days before delivery, start feeding more refined feed. (Note: This photo only captures thirty-one piglets; the other five are obscured by the sow.)

    一胎生了三十六只小猪
    安徽省砀山县唐寨乡团结高级农业社有一头母猪，九月间一胎生了三十六头小猪，现在这些小猪都长得很好。
    负责饲养这头母猪的是安徽省畜牧兽医工作者代表、饲养模范戴世僖，他饲养母猪已经有二十多年的经验。饲养这头母猪的办法是：平时少喂精料多喂粗料，怀孕期经常让母猪出圈运动，到临产前二十天，开始多喂精料。（按：这张照片只摄下三十一头小猪，其他五头被母猪遮住了。）
