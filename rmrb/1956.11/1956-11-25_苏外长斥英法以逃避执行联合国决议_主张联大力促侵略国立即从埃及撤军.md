Xinhua News Agency, New York, November 24th: The United Nations General Assembly continued its debate on the Middle East issue on the afternoon of November 23.

    Soviet Foreign Minister Shepilov spoke first. He said: Among the documents submitted to the General Assembly requiring immediate action by the United Nations, the most important are the report on the implementation of the General Assembly resolutions of November 2 and 7, and the twenty-one nation proposal. From this report, it can be seen that Britain, France, and Israel have fundamentally failed to comply with the General Assembly's resolution requiring them to immediately withdraw their troops from Egypt, and they clearly will not do so in the near future. The three governments are not withdrawing their troops from Egypt and are putting forward various conditions; these conditions would allow them to evade the United Nations Organization's decision requiring withdrawal. The urgent task facing the United Nations now is to take effective steps to dispel these pretexts and ensure that Britain, France, and Israel immediately withdraw their troops from Egypt as required by the General Assembly. This is the only way to stop the aggression against Egypt and eliminate the remnants of this aggression. It is no exaggeration to say that the fate of peace in the Near East, and not just in the Near East, depends mainly on this.

    Shepilov then expressed his support for the twenty-one nation proposal. He said that the Soviet delegation fully supports this proposal and believes that the United Nations General Assembly needs to demand, in the most resolute terms, that British, French, and Israeli troops immediately and completely withdraw from Egypt.

    Shepilov also expressed support for Egypt's demand for an investigation into the atrocities committed by the invading forces against the Egyptian people, and an investigation into the destruction and massacres committed by British and French forces in Port Said and by Israeli forces in Gaza, Rafah, and El Arish.

    Shepilov then spoke about the consequences of the British, French, and Israeli aggression against Egypt. He pointed out that, contrary to the expectations of the aggressors, the aggression against Egypt has not strengthened colonialism; on the contrary, it has further weakened its decaying foundations. Faced with this aggression, the people of all Eastern countries have become even more determined to demand the accelerated elimination of the traces of colonialism on their land.

    Shepilov then emphasized that to solve the Suez issue, all foreign troops must first be withdrawn from Egypt; secondly, this issue can only be resolved through negotiations based on respect for Egypt's inalienable sovereignty, and it is unacceptable to use any foreign troops to exert pressure on Egypt. Therefore, it can be concluded that the United Nations forces cannot have any connection with the final settlement of the Suez issue.

    After Shepilov's speech, Canadian Foreign Minister Pearson defended the actions of Britain, France, and Israel in invading Egypt, insisting that Shepilov's accusations of this aggression were "far-fetched."

    Polish Foreign Minister Naszkowski demanded that British, French, and Israeli troops immediately withdraw from Egypt. He said: On the basis of Egypt's consent and in agreement with Egypt, necessary measures must be taken to clear the canal so that navigation can be restored as soon as possible. The cost of clearing the canal must be borne by the governments that carried out the aggression. Pakistani representative Ikramullah also demanded the immediate withdrawal of British, French, and Israeli troops from Egypt. He expressed opposition to "the stationing of any foreign troops and occupying forces anywhere."

    Iraqi representative Jamali said that Iraq is a loyal member of the Arab League, but at the same time wholeheartedly supports the Baghdad Pact. He said that for Iraq, "aggression against Egypt is aggression against Iraq." He said, "Now is the time for us to face the facts and be realistic. The continued presence of occupying forces in Egypt is a great danger to the Middle East."

    Israeli representative Eban stated that before Israeli troops withdraw from Egypt, Egypt, Arab countries, and the United Nations must agree to a whole host of "necessary conditions," "guarantees," and "safeguards" for Israel.

    Bulgarian Foreign Minister Lukanov said that his country holds the same view as the Arabs, that as long as foreign interventionists are still in Egypt, peace is in danger. The United Nations should demand that British, French, and Israeli troops withdraw from Egypt.

    After the Bulgarian representative's speech, the meeting was adjourned. The next meeting will be held on the morning of the 24th.

    苏外长斥英法以逃避执行联合国决议
    主张联大力促侵略国立即从埃及撤军
    据新华社24日讯　纽约消息：联合国大会全体会议11月23日下午继续就中东问题进行辩论。
    苏联外交部长谢皮洛夫首先发言。他说：在提交大会、需要联合国立即采取行动的文件中，最重要的是关于联合国大会11月2日和7日决议的执行情况的报告以及二十一国的提案。从这个报告中可以看出，英、法和以色列根本没有遵守大会要它们的部队立即撤出埃及的决议，它们显然在最近的将来是不会这样做的。三国政府不把它们的部队撤出埃及，并且提出各种各样的条件；这些条件会使它们得以逃避执行联合国组织要求撤军的决定。联合国现在面临的迫不及待的任务是：采取有效的步骤来打消这些托词，并且保证英、法和以色列立即按照大会所提出的要求从埃及撤军。这是制止对埃及的侵略并且消灭这次侵略的余孽的唯一办法。人们可以毫不夸大地说，近东而且不仅仅是近东的和平的命运主要有赖于此。
    谢皮洛夫接着表示赞成二十一国提案。他说苏联代表团完全支持这个提案，并且认为联合国大会有必要以最坚决的形式要求英、法和以色列军队立刻完全撤出埃及。
    谢皮洛夫还表示支持埃及提出的对入侵部队对埃及人民干下的暴行进行调查，对英法军队在塞得港以及以色列军队在加沙、拉法和埃尔阿里希干下的破坏和屠杀进行调查的要求。
    谢皮洛夫接着谈到英、法和以色列侵略埃及的结果。他指出，同侵略者的期望相反，对埃及的侵略决没有加强殖民主义，反而使它的腐朽的基础遭到进一步的削弱。所有东方国家的人民面对着这次侵略，已经更加坚决要求加速消灭他们土地上的殖民主义的痕迹。
    谢皮洛夫接着强调说，要解决苏伊士问题必须首先从埃及撤退一切外国军队；其次，只有在尊重埃及的不可割让的主权的基础上进行谈判才可能解决这个问题，而利用任何外国军队对埃及行使压力是不能容许的。因此，可以得出结论：联合国部队同苏伊士问题的最后解决不能够有任何关系。
    在谢皮洛夫发言后，加拿大外交部长皮尔逊为英、法和以色列侵略埃及的行为辩解，他硬说谢皮洛夫对这个侵略的指责是“强词夺理”的。
    波兰外交部长纳希科夫斯基要求英、法和以色列军队立即撤出埃及。他说：在取得埃及同意和同埃及协议的基础上，必须采取必要的措施来清理运河以便使航行能够尽快恢复。清理运河的费用必须由进行侵略的政府偿付。巴基斯坦代表伊克拉穆拉也要求英法和以色列军队立即撤出埃及。他表示反对“在任何地方驻扎任何外国军队和占领军。”
    伊拉克代表贾马利说，伊拉克是阿拉伯联盟的一个忠实的成员，但是同时全心全意地支持巴格达条约。他说，对伊拉克说来，“侵略埃及就是侵略伊拉克”。他说，“现在是我们正视事实和实事求是的时候了。占领军继续驻在埃及是对中东的巨大危险。”
    以色列代表伊班表示，在以色列军队撤出埃及以前，埃及、阿拉伯国家以及联合国必须答应以色列一大堆“必要的条件”、“保证”、“保障”等等。
    保加利亚外交部长卢卡诺夫说，他的国家抱着和阿拉伯同样的观点，只要外国干涉主义者还在埃及，和平就处于危险之中。联合国应当要求英、法和以色列部队从埃及撤退。
    在保加利亚代表发言后，会议宣告结束。下次会议将在24日上午举行。
