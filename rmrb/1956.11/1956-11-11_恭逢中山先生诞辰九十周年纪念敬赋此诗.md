    Respectfully Composed Poem in Commemoration of the Ninetieth Anniversary of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's Birth
    Xie Wuliang
    The whole world vies to offer longevity wishes, regretting the passing of a man thirty years ago.
    Carrying on goodness means a new nation, voices rising in unison from different directions.
    The Three Principles of the People are handed down in writings, the Four Sentences shine in the Alliance charter.
    Seeking guidance from the advanced, rectifying the times by following the later kings.
                  (Taking Russia as teacher)
    Humbly gathering every drop of soil, striding across the vast territory.
    Revolution is truly my ambition, now the path is already bright.
    The people all dance and celebrate, the groups of emperors are daily in panic.
    The great righteousness is originally invincible, your vast name will be promoted from now on.
    The stinky acts once flapped their arms, remembering ascending to the hall in Yue.
    Sent on a mission when the mountains and passes were dark, turning the chariot back when the border grasses were yellow.
    Still receiving orders at the point of death, feigning madness out of gratitude.
    Enforcing the law late in the Western Hills, concealing strength in the Northern Sea.
    This humble body is plagued by illness, this meager strength is ashamed to undertake the responsibility.
    Descendants always think of Yu, this solitary heart once approached Tang.
    Governing the state relies on the virtuous and wise, the great undertaking is just unfolding.
    I am ashamed to be an old guest, returning to a scene of utter desolation.

    恭逢中山先生诞辰九十周年纪念敬赋此诗
    谢无量
    普天争献寿，卅载惜人亡。
    继善惟新国，同声起异方。
    三民垂著作，四句耀盟章。
    问礼从先进，匡时法后王。
                  （以俄为师）
    虚衷收壤滴，高步局瀛疆。
    革命诚吾志，于今道已光。
    苍生齐鼓舞，群帝日仓皇。
    大义元无敌，鸿名自此扬。
    羶行曾攘臂，粤峤忆升堂。
    奉使关山黑，回车塞草黄。
    弥留仍受命，感激竟佯狂。
    执法西山晚，韬精北海藏。
    微躯沾疾病，薄力愧承当。
    世纶终思禹，孤怀昔就汤。
    为邦赖贤哲，盛业正开张。
    空惭旧宾客，重到一凄凉。
