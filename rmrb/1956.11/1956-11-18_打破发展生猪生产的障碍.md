    Break Down the Barriers to Developing Hog Production

    Editor's Note: Many readers' letters reflect that there are many difficulties and obstacles in developing hog production. From these letters, it can be seen that the reasons for hindering the increase in hog production are multifaceted. Many difficulties and obstacles are completely avoidable, and are the result of some staff members adopting a work style and methods that are divorced from reality and the masses; it is not like what some people say, "The decline in hog production is all because there is not enough grain." Published here are a few of these letters. In order to break down the various barriers to the development of hog production, it is hoped that local party and government leading organs, as well as agricultural, commercial, and other departments, will strengthen investigation and research work, find some practical and effective methods, correct those erroneous practices, and abolish those negative prohibitions that hinder the development of hog production, so as to improve farmers' enthusiasm for raising pigs and enable hog production to develop rapidly.

    Food Companies in Xinning and Other Counties Violate Hog Purchase Policies

    Why are farmers not allowed to slaughter and eat or sell pigs other than those purchased by the state? Why do food companies arbitrarily lower the grade and price and deduct weight when purchasing pigs from farmers?

    The Hunan Provincial People's Committee once issued instructions: "Farmers can slaughter and eat, slaughter and share, or slaughter and sell pigs other than those purchased by the state." However, food companies in Xinning, Xinhua, Ningxiang, and other counties not only did not implement this instruction, but instead made unauthorized regulations that violated the instruction.

    The Langshan Purchasing and Marketing Station in Xinning County stipulated: "Farmers' non-state purchased pigs must be sold to the food company one foot, one side, or three feet (that is, one-quarter, one-half, or three-quarters) after slaughter." This regulation was also promoted as an experience throughout the county. Ni Jixiang, a member of the Luogan Agricultural Cooperative, slaughtered a pig on June 15 this year and prepared to sell it to members of the cooperative, requesting the Huanglong Purchasing and Marketing Station to waive the purchase. However, the Huanglong Station still forcibly purchased one side. The Ningxiang County Food Company stipulated: "The food company slaughters 40% of non-state purchased pigs, and the farmers slaughter 60%." The so-called food company slaughtering 40% means that the purchasing and marketing station sends a person who does not bring a knife, does not bring money, and does not lift a finger, and sits in the agricultural cooperative to take profits. For example, the accountant of the Huangcai Purchasing and Marketing Station in the county went to Guanshan Township to slaughter pigs this Spring Festival, brought no money, and returned with 1,740 yuan in RMB five days later. After deducting the taxes that should be paid, the purchasing and marketing station obtained a net profit of more than 600 yuan. Farmers said: "We feed pigs for half a year, which is not worth the price of a knife from the food company." This practice of the food company has seriously affected hog production. Xinhua County's total hog production this year decreased by 25% compared to last year. According to a survey of one cooperative in Heshan Agricultural Cooperative in Baisha Township, Xinning County, the entire cooperative raised a total of 277 pigs last year, which decreased to 140 this year, a decrease of nearly half compared to last year.

    Food companies in Xinning, Xinhua, Ningxiang, and other counties also lower the grade and price, "examine the trough," and deduct weight in their purchase work. The Matouqiao Purchasing and Marketing Station of the Xinning County Food Company stipulated that farmers should feed their pigs in the morning, send them to the station in the afternoon, and weigh them the next morning. The Shui Temple Purchasing and Marketing Station drove the pigs sent by the farmers to run in circles in the yard, in order to eliminate the trough. Among the eleven purchasing and marketing stations in the county, except for one transfer station, the other ten stations had the phenomenon of large scales for purchasing and small scales for selling. Among the 150 scales in the ten stations, 34 were inaccurate, with the purchasing scale being 1 to 2 jin larger per 100 jin, and the selling scale being 1 to 4 liang less per jin. At the same time, some unreasonable methods of deducting weight and lowering grades were also implemented. For example, the Huanglong Purchasing and Marketing Station stipulated that all pigs sent by farmers should have 1 to 9 jin deducted from the weight. In October last year, Li Yu'en, a member of the Luogan Agricultural Cooperative, sent a pig to the Huanglong Station, which weighed 135 jin and had 5 jin deducted after being kept for half a day. At the same time, the purchasing and marketing station also divided the pigs sent by the farmers into various types such as "bamboo tube pigs," "wallboard pigs," "hanging belly pigs," and "double frame pigs," and carried out "trough examination" and weight deduction separately. The Shuangfu Purchasing and Marketing Station in Ningxiang County kept the pigs sent by Yuan Maochai, a member of the Shuanghe Agricultural Cooperative, for three days and four nights in May this year before weighing them. Yuan Maochai said: "If you don't weigh it for three days and four nights, the meat will lose more than ten jin. Is this beneficial to the country? Or is it beneficial to the farmers?"

    The food companies in Xinning, Xinhua, Ningxiang, and other counties did not reduce the number of fully fed pigs sent by farmers or reduce purchase losses by taking these measures, but only aroused serious dissatisfaction among farmers.

    The Xinning, Xinhua, Ningxiang, and other county food companies' serious violations of national policies and actions that damage the interests of farmers have hindered hog production. Local leaders should quickly correct them in order to promote farmers' enthusiasm for raising pigs and develop hog production. 　　　　　　　　　　Zou Xiyan

    Is it Promoting Good Breeding Pigs, or Promoting Swine Fever?

    This year, farmers in the Jinhua Special Zone of Zhejiang Province ordered more than 1,900 high-quality breeding pigs from the state-owned Jinhua Pig Farm. In the first quarter, the pig farm supplied farmers with 80 breeding pigs, which caused great losses to the farmers.

    What is the reason? It turned out that after the farm suffered an epidemic in August last year, by the end of April this year, most of the 338 sows in the farm were infected, and 93 died. However, the farm did not abide by the epidemic prevention system, and before the pig epidemic had stopped, it sold the piglets to the farmers. In this way, the breeding pigs spread the disease. For example, after five agricultural cooperatives in Xuanping County purchased good breeds from the farm, the pigs in the cooperatives all developed the same epidemic; the Shenglin Agricultural Cooperative in Hongtan Township purchased two purebred sows, which had a cough. In mid-August, all 22 local sows in the original cooperative were infected and three died. After the Guangming Agricultural Cooperative in Chengguan Town, Qu County purchased breeding pigs from the farm, by May 29, 62 of the 103 sows raised collectively were infected, and 7 were slaughtered urgently or died. After the Kenhuang Senior Cooperative in Wuyi County purchased breeding pigs from the farm, 19 of the 32 pigs in the entire cooperative became ill. They reflected: "The pig breeds from the Jinhua Pig Farm are pig ghosts!"

    The high price of breeding pigs also makes farmers very dissatisfied. Originally, purebred Yorkshire breeding pigs only needed about 30 yuan each when they were weaned and left the farm after two months, but this year they were all postponed to four months before being sold, costing 50 to 60 yuan each. Speaking of which, the farm still has a good reason, saying that breeding is not like raising fattening pigs, and the price should be higher. But what about the hybrid pigs that the farm promotes for fattening? This year, the Pan'an County Supply and Marketing Cooperative purchased 100 hybrid pigs from the farm, each weighing an average of about 45 jin, and the price was 7 jiao and 5 fen per jin. It cost 9 jiao per jin to transport them to Pan'an County, an average of 40 yuan per pig, which is equivalent to the value of a 130-jin fat pig. Farmers reflected that "raising pigs for half a year for nothing cannot be sold for this price." As a result, 21 of the 100 hybrid pigs were backlogged, and the supply and marketing cooperative had to reduce the price at a loss, selling them at 6 jiao per jin.

    It is unrealistic to say that all the good breeds of pigs promoted by the Jinhua Pig Farm this year are bad. But this year, some small pigs that did not meet the specifications were indeed sold at the price of qualified breeding pigs. The Sanhe Township Shengli Agricultural Cooperative and the Fangyan Township Sanlian Agricultural Cooperative in Yongkang County purchased two purebred Yorkshire sows from the farm in May. After raising them for three and a half months, each only gained a little more than 3 jin. Now the cooperative members are complaining about the cadres who handled the procurement, but the cadres have grievances that they cannot express.

    These practices of the farm are inseparable from the leadership of the Provincial Department of Agriculture. Originally, the pig farm's epidemic had not stopped in January, but the Provincial Department of Agriculture, regardless of whether the epidemic was contagious, easily agreed to lift the blockade of the farm. In order to make up for the loss of the epidemic, the Department of Agriculture, regardless of the farmers' ability to bear the burden, approved the farm to extend the promotion of pigs to four months of age on July 30. I think this practice must be changed. 　　　　Wang Zhuangrui

    It is Not Right to Prohibit Castration Across the Board

    This spring, in order to develop bristle hog production, Pinghe County, Fujian Province planned to increase the number of sows in the county from more than 8,800 to 15,005. To this end, the Agricultural Bureau of the County People's Committee ordered the county's castration personnel: all pigs that can be used as sows must not be castrated. Otherwise, they will be punished. Since the implementation of this method, it has indeed had some effect. According to statistics at the end of July, there were 14,998 sows in the county, only 7 fewer than the original plan. However, this coercive method has been opposed by the masses. Since the above method was adopted, all castration personnel in the county have almost become unemployed. According to the reflection of seven castration personnel in the Banzai District, each person castrates less than five pigs per month on average. Lin Gua, a widow in Wujia Township, bought two pigs, both of which were female. But because of her financial difficulties, she asked the castration personnel to castrate them, but they did not agree. When the sows were in heat, she did not find a boar to mate with them, so the pigs ran around and jumped around in the house all day long, howling non-stop, and their weight also decreased. Many farmers dissatisfiedly said: "Since ancient times, I have never heard of prohibiting castration." The collective breeding group of the Bao Nan Agricultural Cooperative, headed by Zeng Qishan, raised six pigs, four of which were sows. The group leader bitterly begged the cadres of the agricultural technology promotion station: "Castrate them, how can a production team of ten households afford to raise four sows?" But no one paid any attention. There are more than 20 households in Bao Nan Township alone who are not suitable for raising sows and do not want to raise sows, but are forced to raise them.

    In order to develop hog production and encourage farmers to raise more sows, this is beneficial to the country and the people. However, the practice of Pinghe County, regardless of conditions and reasons, and rigidly prohibiting castration across the board, cannot truly promote the development of pig raising. 　　　　　　　　　　Lian Wenwu

    Cannot Forcibly Make Production Area Prices Obey Sales Area Prices

    Minxian County is a hog-producing county in Gansu Province. The pigs produced in this county, in addition to supplying the county itself, also have a large part sold to Lanzhou, Longxi, and other areas. This year, the number of pig farmers in the county has decreased, and the total number of pigs in the county has decreased by half compared to last year. In addition to the fact that many places suffered from hog cholera in the second half of last year, there are also many problems in terms of purchase.

    The purchase price of pigs here is now low. The mountainous areas far from the county seat and with inconvenient transportation are even lower. This is because when the purchasing department stipulates the purchase price, it is based on the purchase price near the county seat, and then the transportation costs from the production area to the county seat are deducted according to the distance. For example, the purchase price of bone-in meat in Chengguan District is 4 jiao 8 fen and 9 li per jin, in Puma District it is 4 jiao 5 fen, in Lujiing District it is 4 jiao 4 fen, and in the nearest Mayang District it is 4 jiao 2 fen. This method of forcibly making production area prices obey sales area prices is unreasonable.

    In the purchase, the policy of high quality and high price, and pricing by grade, was not implemented. Regardless of large pigs, medium pigs, fat pigs, or lean pigs, the purchase price was uniformly set at 4 jiao 2 fen per jin. This is actually a way to suppress prices for farmers who raise large pigs and fat pigs, and it cannot stimulate farmers to improve the quality of pig raising.

    Due to the excessively low purchase price, farmers use the excuse of self-consumption and are unwilling to sell pigs even if they have them, causing difficulties in procurement. Therefore, the phenomenon of coercive orders has occurred in some places. For example, some purchasers in Mayang District, fearing that the masses would be unwilling to sell, called on rural party members, league members, and cooperative cadres to hold meetings to "persuade" the farmers to sell pigs. Deng Yingde, a farmer from Chuanziyan Village, Shajin Township, raised two fat pigs with his family of three. Because the price was low, he was unwilling to sell them. The purchasing personnel conducted "persuasion" at the mass meeting like this: "Before liberation, we couldn't even sleep peacefully; now that we have turned over, if you don't want to sell pigs, you are not responding to Chairman Mao's call..." Under such repeated "mobilization," Deng Yingde had no choice but to "agree." After the pigs were sold, the whole family cried bitterly. 　 Xue Buwen, Zheng Jueshi, Song Lianke

### 打破发展生猪生产的障碍

专栏：读者来信

    打破发展生猪生产的障碍
    编者按　不少读者来信反映：在发展生猪生产中有许多困难和障碍。从这些来信中可以看出，阻障生猪增产的原因是多方面的，不少困难和障碍完全是可以避免的，是某些工作人员采取脱离实际脱离群众的工作作风和方法的结果；并不像某些人说的“生猪减产都是因为粮食不够用”。这里发表的是这类来信中的几篇。为了打破发展生猪生产的各种障碍，希望各地党政领导机关和农业、商业等部门加强调查研究工作，找出一些切实有效的办法，纠正那些错误的作法，取消那些妨碍生猪生产发展的消极的禁令，以便提高农民养猪的积极性，使生猪生产得到迅速发展。
    新宁等县食品公司违反生猪收购政策
    派购以外的猪，为什么不允许自宰自食或出售？  收购农民的猪，为什么随意地压级压价和扣秤？
    湖南省人民委员会曾经发出指示：“派购以外的生猪，农民可以自宰自食、自宰分食、自宰出售。”但是，新宁、新化、宁乡等县食品公司，不但不执行这个指示，反而擅自作出违反指示的规定。
    新宁县崀山购销站规定：“农民的非派购猪在自宰后必须卖给食品公司一只脚、一边或三只脚（即四分之一、二分之一或四分之三）”。这个规定还作为经验在全县推广。罗干农业社社员倪吉祥今年6月15日自宰一头猪，准备分卖给本社社员，要求黄龙购销站免购。但是，黄龙站还是硬收购了一边。宁乡县食品公司规定：“非派购猪食品公司杀40％，农民杀60％。”所谓食品公司杀40％，就是购销站派一个人，一不带刀，二不带钱，三不动手，在农业社坐取利润。例如：该县黄材购销站会计，今年春节到官山乡去杀猪，一文未带，五天后就带回人民币一千七百四十元，除去应缴的税金外，该购销站取得纯利六百多元。农民说：“我们喂半年猪还抵不到食品公司一把刀”。食品公司这种做法，严重影响了生猪生产。新化县今年全县生猪生产量比去年减少25％。新宁县根据白沙乡合心农业社一个社的调查，全社去年养猪共二百七十七头，今年减少到一百四十头，比去年减产近一半。
    新宁、新化、宁乡等县食品公司在收购工作中还压级压价、“考槽”、扣秤。新宁县食品公司马头桥购销站规定农民当天早晨喂猪，下午送猪，次日早晨过秤。水庙购销站将农民送来的猪，一律赶到坪里跑圈，达到消槽的目的。该县共十一个购销站，除了一个转运站以外，其它十个站都有大秤进小秤出的现象。十个站一百五十条秤中不准确的有三十四条，进货秤每百斤大一至二斤，销售秤每斤少一至四两。同时还实行了一些不合理的扣秤压级的办法。例如：黄龙购销站规定：凡农民送来的猪一律要扣秤一斤至九斤。去年10月罗干农业社员李玉恩送一头猪到黄龙站，计重一百三十五斤，关了半天后又扣了五斤秤。同时购销站还将农民送的猪分为“竹筒猪”、“墙板猪”、“吊肚猪”、“双架猪”等各种类型，分别进行“考槽”、扣秤。宁乡县双凫购销站，今年5月间，将双合农业社社员袁茂才送来的猪，关了三天四晚才过称。袁茂才说：“三天四晚不过秤，肉都要掉十几斤，这对国家有利？还是对农民有利？”
    新宁、新化、宁乡等县食品公司，采取这些办法，并没有减少农民送饱食猪的数量和降低收购损耗，只不过引起了农民的严重不满。
    新宁、新化、宁乡等县食品公司严重违反国家政策，损害农民利益的行为，阻碍了生猪的生产。当地领导部门应当迅速加以纠正，以利促进农民养猪积极性，发展生猪生产。　　　　　　　　　邹希衍
    是推广优良种猪，还是推广猪疫？
    今年，浙江省金华专区农民向国营金华猪场订购优良种猪一千九百多头。第一季度猪场供应农民八十头种猪，这些猪给农民带来了很大的损失。
    什么原因呢？原来这个场在去年8月发生疫病后，到今年4月底止，全场三百三十八头母猪大部染病，死亡了九十三头。而这个场没有遵守防疫制度，猪的疫病还未停止，就把小猪卖给农民。这样，种猪就把病灾传播开去。如宣平县有五个农业社向这个场购回良种后，社里的猪都发生了同样的疫病；洪坦乡胜利农业社购回二头纯种母猪，都有咳嗽的毛病，8月中旬连原来社里的二十二头本地母猪也全部染病，并死亡三头。衢县城关镇光明农业社向该场购回种猪后，到5月29日止，集体饲养的一百零三头母猪中感染发病的有六十二头，其中急宰和死亡七头。武义县垦荒高级社，向该场购回种猪后，全社三十二头猪，发病的十九头，他们反映：“金华猪场的猪种是猪鬼！”
    种猪价格高，也使农民甚为不满。原来纯种约克夏种猪二个月断奶出场，每头只需三十元左右，今年都推迟到四个月后出售，每头需五十到六十元。说起来这个场还很有理由，说什么做种不是做育肥猪，价格再高些也是应该的。可是这个场推广育肥用的杂交猪又是怎样呢？今年磐安县供销社向这个场购回杂交猪一百头，每头平均重四十五斤左右，价格每斤七角五分。到磐安县连运费每斤要九角，平均每头要四十元，相当一头一百三十斤重的肥猪价值。农民反映“白养半年还卖不到这个价”。结果一百头杂交猪积压二十一头，供销社只好亏本削价，每斤按六角出售。
    说金华猪场今年推广的良种猪都不好，是不切实际的。可是今年的确也有部分不符规格的小猪，也按合格种猪的价格出售。永康县三合乡胜利农业社和方岩乡三联农业社在5月份向这个场购回二头纯种约克夏母猪，养了三个半月，每头只增重三市斤多些。现在是社员埋怨经手采购的干部，而干部是有苦说不出口。
    这个场的这些做法，是和省农业厅的领导分不开的。原来猪场在1月份疫病还未停止，而省农业厅却不顾疫病有无传染性，轻易同意这个场解除封锁。为了弥补疫病损失，农业厅又不顾农民负担能力，在7月30日，批准该场推广猪只一律延长到四个月大出场。我认为这种做法必须改变。　　　　王庄瑞
    不该一律禁止阉猪
    今年春季，福建平和县为了发展毛猪生产，计划把全县的母猪由八千八百多头增加到一万五千零五头。县人民委员会农业局为此命令全县的阉割人员：凡是能当母猪的猪一律不准阉割。否则，将受到处分。这个办法实行以来，也真有些效果。到7月底统计，全县有母猪一万四千九百九十八头，比原计划只少七头。但是，这种强迫命令的做法，却遭到群众的反对。自采取以上做法后，全县所有阉割人员几乎陷于失业，据坂仔区七个阉割人员的反映，平均每人每月阉猪不到五头。五甲乡的寡妇林瓜买的两头猪都是母的。但是她因为生活困难，要求阉割人员给阉掉，没有答应。母猪发情了，她不给它找种猪交配，猪就整天在屋内乱奔乱跳，不停地嚎叫，体重也减少了。很多农民不满地说：“自古以来，从没听说过禁止阉猪的。”宝南农业社曾祈山生产小组集体养了六头猪，有四头是母猪。组长向农业技术推广站干部苦苦哀求说：“给阉吧，咱一个十户人家的生产小组哪能养得起四头母猪？”可是没人理睬。像这样不适合养母猪，不愿意养母猪，而硬要他们养母猪的，单宝南乡就有二十多户。
    为了发展生猪生产，提倡农民多养母猪，这本是于国于民有利的事。但是，平和县不顾条件，不分情由，一律硬性禁止阉猪的做法，是不能真正促进养猪事业的发展的。　　　　　　　　　　连文伍
    不能强使产地价格服从销地价格
    岷县是甘肃省的一个产猪县。这个县生产的猪，除了供应本县以外，还有很大一部分外销到兰州、陇西一带。今年这个县养猪的减少了，全县猪的总头数比去年减少了一半。减少的原因，除了去年下半年很多地方发生猪瘟以外，在收购方面也存在不少问题。
    现在这里猪的收购价格是偏低的。离县城远、交通不方便的山区，就显得更低。这是因为收购部门在规定收购价格的时候，是以县城附近的收购价为基础，然后分别按照远近情况，减去由产地到县城的运费等，得出各地的收购价格的。例如城关区每斤带骨肉收购价是四角八分九厘，蒲麻区是四角五分，闾井区是四角四分，最近的马沿区则是四角二分。这种硬使产地价格服从销地价格的办法是不合理的。
    在收购中，也没有执行优质优价、分等论价的政策。不论大猪、中猪、肥猪、瘦猪，收购价一律定为每斤四角二分。这对于喂大猪，肥猪的农民来说，实际上也是一种压价的办法，是不能刺激农民提高养猪质量的。
    由于收购价格过低，农民就借口自食，有猪也不愿出卖，造成采购的困难。因此，有些地方又发生了强迫命令的现象。如马沿区有的采购员，怕群众不愿意卖，就叫农村的党员、团员和合作社干部召开会议，“说服”农民卖猪。沙金乡川子眼村农民邓应德全家三口人喂了两头肥猪，因为价低不愿出卖，采购人员就在群众会上这样进行“说服”：“解放前连个安稳觉也睡不了；现在翻身了，不愿卖猪就是不响应毛主席的号召。……”在这样的反复“动员”下，邓应德只好“同意”了。猪卖出以后，全家大哭一场。	　薛步文、郑觉时、宋连科
