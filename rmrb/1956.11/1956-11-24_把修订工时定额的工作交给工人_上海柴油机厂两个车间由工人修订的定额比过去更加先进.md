    Giving Workers the Task of Revising Work Quotas
    The Revised Quotas by Workers in Two Workshops of the Shanghai Diesel Engine Factory are More Advanced than Before
    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 23rd. (Xinhua News Agency reporter Xu Zhongni, He Changhua report): The state-owned Shanghai Diesel Engine Factory recently assigned the task of revising work quotas to the workers of two workshops themselves.
    The new method is to hand over the original quotas and the workers' actual working hour records of recent periods as data, allowing the workers to set new work quotas for each type of part themselves. The quotas revised by the workers themselves in the forging workshop have been reviewed and approved by the factory's administrative leaders and announced for implementation from the 19th. Calculated using the main diesel engine parts processed in this workshop, the new quota is 15.4% lower on average than the quota implemented in the previous six months. Another pilot workshop, the foundry workshop, has not yet completed all the quota revisions, but from the many quotas that have been revised, they are also relatively advanced.
    Having the workers revise the quotas themselves further stimulated the workers' enthusiasm for managing the enterprise. A branch secretary said: "Because the attitude towards quotas is different, in the past, when the quotas were set by the higher-ups and handed down, we always felt that the higher-ups were compressing the quotas. If it was too tight, we were dissatisfied; if it was too loose, we would get too much overtime and more wages anyway, as it was set by the higher-ups. Now that the workers are in charge themselves, managing their own enterprise, naturally they can't just think about getting more wages, but should think more about improving production and accelerating socialist construction."
    These days, of the thirty-five types of parts being processed in the forging workshop, twenty-one have already reached or exceeded the new quota, and fourteen are slightly short. It is estimated that in the first month, more than 80% of the workers will be able to reach and exceed the new quota. A worker told the reporter: "These days, because the molds supplied by the tool workshop are good, the machine tools have been repaired, and everyone is trying to implement assembly line operations. We made 781 pieces in one day, greatly exceeding the new quota. Another shift of workers also caught up, making more than 600 pieces." He said that if the quota was set loosely, everyone would not actively adopt the assembly line method.
    The reporter asked Wang Enwen, the deputy director in charge of leading the new method pilot project in these two workshops, to talk about his views. He said that after the factory's Party committee proposed letting the workers take control of the quotas, some cadres in the labor and wage departments and workshops were worried that the workers might only focus on wage income and set the quotas conservatively. The opposite is true. He pointed out that this is because the Party strengthened political and ideological education before and during the workers' revision of the quotas, paying special attention to giving play to the role of Party members and activists, so that advanced thinking prevailed among the workers, educating and driving the backward. At the same time, attention should be paid to strengthening the work of helping workers improve their skills in the future. Only on the basis of raising the awareness of the masses can this work be done well.

    把修订工时定额的工作交给工人
    上海柴油机厂两个车间由工人修订的定额比过去更加先进
    据新华社上海23日电　新华社记者徐中尼、贺昌华报道：国营上海柴油机厂最近把修订工时定额的工作交给两个车间工人自己去做。
    新办法是把原来的定额和最近时期工人实际的工时纪录作为资料，交给工人自己去订定每种零件的新工时定额。锻工车间由工人自己修订的定额，已经由工厂行政领导方面审查批准，从19日起公布实行。新定额以这个车间加工的柴油机主要零件计算，比前六个月实行的定额平均压缩了15.4％。另一个试行的车间——铸工车间，现在修订定额的工作还没有全部结束，就已经修订的许多定额看，也是比较先进。
    由工人自己修订定额，进一步发挥了工人管理企业的积极性。一个支部书记说：因为对待定额的心情不同了，过去上面订好了交下来，总觉得这是上面在压缩定额，紧了就不满；松了也落得多超额、多拿工资，横竖是上面订的。现在交给工人自己作主，自己的企业自己管理，自然不能只为了多拿工资，应该多从提高生产、加快社会主义建设着想了。
    这几天，锻工车间正在加工的三十五种零件，有二十一种已经达到或超过新定额，有十四种还差一点，估计在第一个月就将有80％以上的工人可以达到和超过新定额。一个工人告诉记者：这两天，因为工具车间供应的模子好，机床经过修理，大家又想办法实行流水作业，一天做到七百八十一只，大大超过新定额，另外一班工人也追上来，做到六百多只。他说，要是定额订得松，大家就不会积极采用流水作业法了。
    记者请负责领导这两个车间试行新办法的副厂长王恩文谈谈他的看法。他说，厂的党委会这次提出放手让工人自己掌握定额的意见以后，劳动工资部门和车间的一些干部曾经顾虑到工人可能只从工资收入着眼，定额订得保守。事实恰恰相反。他指出，这是由于党在工人修订定额以前和进行中，加强了政治思想教育，特别注意发挥党员和积极分子的作用，工人中先进的思想占优势，教育和带动了落后，同时还要注意在以后加强帮助工人提高技术的工作。只有在提高群众觉悟的基础上，才可能做好这个工作。
