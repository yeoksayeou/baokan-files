Xinhua News Agency, 1st. The Ministry of Agricultural Products Procurement convened a telephone conference on October 30th, demanding that all cotton producing areas vigorously strengthen cotton purchasing work. Participants in the conference included the directors of agricultural product procurement departments (bureaus) from thirteen provinces, including Hebei, Henan, Shandong, Jiangsu, Hubei, Hunan, Sichuan, and Liaoning, as well as responsible cadres from the finance, grain, and trade offices of these provinces.

Yang Yichen, Minister of the Ministry of Agricultural Products Procurement, pointed out at the meeting that, based on past experience, 80% of the national cotton unified purchase task must be completed before the end of the year, and efforts should be made to basically complete or exceed the annual cotton unified purchase task before the end of the lunar year. He also emphasized that cotton is a material subject to unified state purchase and must be purchased uniformly by state procurement agencies. Free trade is not allowed before the unified purchase task is completed. Some places have listed coarse cotton as a commodity that can be traded on the free market, which is incorrect and should be strictly prevented and corrected.

Yang Yichen said that in order to smoothly complete the cotton unified purchase task, the following three issues must be noted. First, regarding the issue of cotton retained by cotton farmers. After agricultural cooperativization, all members became cotton farmers, which increased the amount retained. At the same time, the country's demand for raw cotton has increased this year, and the supply of civilian cotton has also exceeded the plan. To ensure the country's urgent need for cotton, agricultural cooperatives and members must be educated to save cotton within the prescribed retention amount, retain as little as possible, and retain low-grade cotton as much as possible, selling the good cotton to the state. According to the materials reflected in reports from various places, the amount of cotton retained by farmers as stipulated by the state is sufficient, and in some areas, it is even ample. As long as all procurement work cadres pay attention to this issue, and under the leadership of party and government organs, do the work meticulously and thoroughly, and patiently conduct persuasion and education, the vast majority of cotton farmers will support us. Second, regarding the issue of homemade spinning and weaving. The state, in order to take care of farmers' habits of spinning, weaving, and using for themselves, once stipulated that an appropriate compression policy should be adopted for homemade spinning and weaving. This year, in disaster-stricken areas, the needs of farmers for production and self-rescue can be appropriately taken care of, and they can be supplied with a certain amount of cotton; after several years of cotton unified purchase, in areas where the habit of homemade spinning and weaving has shrunk, a certain amount of cotton can also be supplied appropriately. However, there are many avenues for rural sideline production, and farmers should be persuaded and educated not to expand the sideline production of homemade spinning and weaving any further. Whether in disaster-stricken or non-disaster-stricken areas, the supply of raw materials for homemade spinning and weaving must be planned and controlled, and cannot be blindly developed. Third, regarding the banning of black market transactions in cotton. Since cotton is uniformly purchased by state procurement agencies, black market transactions are illegal. Since the new cotton has been put on the market, many small merchants and peddlers have been found to be purchasing cotton or homemade yarn and cloth from farmers for black market transactions. This must be strictly prevented or banned. He hoped that agricultural product procurement departments in various places, under the leadership of party and government organs, would conduct unified research on the above issues and put forward specific measures for implementation.

Then, Yang Yichen requested that agricultural product procurement departments in various places, under the leadership of party and government organs and in coordination with agricultural production departments, assist agricultural cooperatives in comprehensively arranging labor and vigorously strengthen cotton purchasing work. He said that agricultural product procurement departments in various places should help agricultural cooperatives make arrangements according to local conditions so that production and the selling of cotton are not delayed. Procurement stations in various places generally have liaison officers, and it is hoped that they will further strengthen their ties with agricultural cooperatives, carry out rapid and increased procurement, and organize planned cotton collection work. In order to increase the income of members and consolidate agricultural cooperatives, agricultural product procurement departments should support agricultural cooperatives with the conditions to process and sell lint cotton. However, agricultural cooperatives with small processing capacity or lack of technology must be persuaded not to temporarily purchase additional ginning equipment, so as to avoid excessive investment that fails to increase the income of members. The time for agricultural cooperatives to process cotton should generally not exceed the end of the lunar year, so as not to affect spring plowing production. For the seed cotton retained by agricultural cooperatives, measures such as processing on their behalf or exchanging cotton seeds of the same variety and grade can be adopted to promote their early sale of cotton; at the same time, agricultural product processing departments must ensure the purity of cotton seeds.

Yang Yichen said that the work efficiency of grassroots procurement stations should be improved to meet the requirements of agricultural cooperatives for selling cotton as much as possible. Cotton inspection work should be further strengthened and improved. The problem of untimely cotton transportation, backlog at grassroots receiving points, and tight supply for textile mills should also be resolved quickly. At present, it is necessary to organize a certain number of cadres to go deep into procurement stations and processing plants to provide specific assistance in order to promote the development of cotton purchasing work.

Yang Yichen also said that in order to strictly enforce the credit of pre-purchase contracts and establish a sense of responsibility on both sides for the pre-purchase contracts, agricultural cooperatives and cotton farmers who overfulfill the delivery tasks stipulated in the pre-purchase contracts should earnestly implement the state-stipulated preferential treatment methods for the supply of physical goods; for agricultural cooperatives and cotton farmers who fail to complete the delivery tasks, the contracts must be cancelled after clarifying the situation. Pre-purchase deposits must be recovered within the prescribed time limit. If the commercial cotton produced by a small number of agricultural cooperatives and cotton farmers is not enough to repay the pre-purchase deposits, the repayment can be postponed to next year, but the procedures for deferred repayment must be completed. As for some agricultural cooperatives that have difficulties in production and life after repaying the pre-purchase deposits, they can be resolved through loans or other methods. Finally, Yang Yichen pointed out that it is necessary to do a good job in cotton safety and fire prevention work.

    农产品采购部召开电话会议
    要求各棉产区加强棉花收购工作
    统购任务完成以前不允许自由交易
    新华社1日讯　农产品采购部在10月30日召开的电话会议上，要求各产棉区大力加强棉花收购工作。参加这次会议的有河北、河南、山东、江苏、湖北、湖南、四川、辽宁等十三个省农产品采购厅（局）长和这些省财粮贸办公室的负责干部。
    农产品采购部部长杨一辰在会上指出，根据历年的情况，全国在年底以前必须完成棉花统购任务的80％，并且争取在旧历年底基本完成或超额完成全年度的棉花统购任务。他并且着重指出，棉花是国家实行统购的物资，一定要由国家采购机构统一收购，在统购任务未完成以前不允许自由交易。有的地方把粗绒棉列为可以在自由市场上交易的商品，这是不对的，应该严加防止和纠正。
    杨一辰说，为了顺利完成棉花统购任务，必须注意以下三个问题。首先，关于棉农留用棉的问题。农业合作化以后，全体社员都成为棉农，这就增加了留用量。同时，今年国家对原棉的需要量增加，民用棉的供应也已经突破计划。为保证国家对棉花的迫切需要，要教育农业社和社员在规定的留用量范围内节约用棉，尽量少留一些，并且尽量留用次棉，把好棉卖给国家。根据各地报告所反映的材料，国家规定的农民留用棉数量是够用的，有的地区还是宽裕的。只要全体采购工作干部重视这个问题，在党和政府机关领导下把工作做得细致些，深入些，耐心地进行说服教育，广大棉农是会支持我们的。其次，关于土纺土织问题。国家为了照顾农民自纺自织自用的习惯，曾经规定对土纺土织采取适当压缩的方针。今年在受灾地区可以适当照顾农民生产自救的需要，供应他们一定数量的棉花；经过几年的棉花统购，在土纺土织习惯已经缩小的地区，也可以适当供应一定数量的棉花。但是，农村副业生产的门路是很多的，应该说服教育农民不要再扩大土纺土织的副业生产。无论在灾区或非灾区，对土纺土织的原料供应，都必须有计划地控制，不能盲目发展。第三，关于取缔棉花的黑市成交问题。棉花既由国家采购机购统一收购，黑市成交就是非法的。自从新棉上市以来，各地已经发现不少小商小贩套购农民的棉花或土纱土布，进行黑市交易。对此，一定要严加防止或取缔。他希望各地农产品采购部门在党和政府机关领导下，对以上问题进行统一研究，提出具体措施贯彻执行。
    然后，杨一辰要求各地农产品采购部门在党和政府机关领导下，配合农业生产部门，协助农业社全面安排劳动力，大力加强棉花收购工作。他说，各地农产品采购部门应当因地制宜帮助农业社做到生产和交售棉花两不误。各地采购站一般都有了联络员，希望进一步加强同农业社的联系，开展快收多收，组织有计划的收棉工作。为了增加社员收入和巩固农业社，农产品采购部门应当支持有条件的农业社加工出售皮棉。但是，对于加工力量小或者缺乏技术的农业社，必须说服它们不要再临时添购轧花设备，以免投资过大反而不能增加社员收入。农业社加工棉花的时间，一般不要超过旧历年底，以免影响到春耕生产。对农业社的留种棉，可以采取代为加工，或用同品种同等级棉花的棉籽交换等办法，促使它们早日出售棉花；同时，农产品加工部门要保证棉种的纯度。
    杨一辰说，基层采购站的工作效率应当提高，以尽量满足农业社出售棉花的要求。棉花检验工作应当进一步加强和提高。棉花调运不及时，基层接运点积压而纱厂供应紧张的问题，也应当迅速解决。目前需要组织一定数量的干部深入采购站和加工厂，给予具体的帮助，以推动棉花收购工作的开展。
    杨一辰还说，为了严肃预购合同信用和树立双方对预购合同的责任感，对于超额完成预购合同所规定的交售任务的农业社和棉农，要认真执行国家规定的实物供应优待办法；对于完不成交售任务的农业社和棉农，必须弄清情况后再注销合同。预购定金一定要按照规定的期限收回。少数农业社和棉农所生产的商品棉，不足以归还预购定金时，可以延缓到明年归还，但是必须办理好缓期归还的手续。至于有些农业社归还预购定金后在生产、生活上有困难，可以用贷款或其它办法解决。最后，杨一辰指出要做好棉花的安全消防工作。
