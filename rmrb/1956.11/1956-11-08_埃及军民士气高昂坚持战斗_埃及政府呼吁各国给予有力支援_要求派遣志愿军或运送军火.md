Xinhua News Agency, November 7th, Cairo News: The General Command of the Egyptian Armed Forces issued Public Bulletin No. 31 on the evening of November 6th stating: "British and French troops continue to invade Port Said. The bombardment of the city from the sea and air has been ongoing throughout the day. Our armed forces, together with the people's militia, continue to engage in fierce battles with the enemy, street by street, house by house."

Earlier, the Egyptian armed forces stated in another communique that Egyptian troops still controlled Port Said, except for the Jamil area and the Port Fouad area. Jamil is west of Port Said. Port Fouad is on the east bank of the northern end of the Suez Canal, opposite Port Said across the canal.

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, November 7th: The "Hindustan Times" correspondent in Damascus quoted an Egyptian spokesman on November 6th as saying that although Britain and France used no less than a thousand aircraft to carry out air strikes, causing widespread destruction in an attempt to intimidate the Egyptian people, the morale of the Egyptian people remained very high.

According to the reporter, in Cairo, the people had not lost their courage in the slightest, and even during the air raids, they came out in thousands to cheer President Nasser, who was riding in an open car, unafraid of danger.

Xinhua News Agency, November 7th, Cairo News: The Egyptian Government Information Department issued an appeal on November 6th stating: "France, Israel, and Britain are launching a treacherous attack on Egypt, and are provocatively waving the banner of disregard for law and shameful behavior. Egypt calls on all those in the world who still care about human dignity and the rule of law in international relations to send volunteer troops, transport military supplies, or provide assistance in other ways.

The Egyptian people are engaged in a war of survival. They are fighting not only for themselves and their country, but also for the civilized world.

As long as the aggression against Egypt continues on its territory, in disregard of United Nations resolutions, Egypt will continue to fight against the forces of evil with unparalleled determination and all its strength, for dignity and a life worth living.

It needs your help."

    埃及军民士气高昂坚持战斗
    埃及政府呼吁各国给予有力支援
    要求派遣志愿军或运送军火
    新华社7日讯　开罗消息：埃及武装部队总司令部在11月6日晚间发表三十一号公报说：“英法军队继续侵犯塞得港。从海上和空中对这个城市的轰击整天在进行着。我们的武装部队同人民武装一起，从一条街到一条街，从一栋房子到一栋房子，继续同敌人进行激烈的战斗。”
    早些时候，埃及武装部队在另一份公报中说，除加米尔地区和福德港地区以外，埃及军队仍然控制着塞得港。加米尔在塞得港以西。福德港在苏伊士运河北端的东岸，同塞得港隔河相对。
    新华社新德里7日电　“印度斯坦时报”驻大马士革特派记者11月6日引述埃及发言人的话说，尽管英法两国使用了不少于一千架的飞机进行空袭，造成广泛的破坏，企图借以威吓埃及人民，但是，埃及人民士气依然很高。
    据这位记者报道，在开罗，人民丝毫也没有丧失他们的勇气，甚至在空袭的时候，他们都成千地出来向不怕危险乘着敞篷车出来的纳赛尔总统欢呼。
    新华社7日讯　开罗消息：埃及政府情报司11月6日发表呼吁书说：“法国、以色列和英国正在对埃及发动背信弃义的进攻，并且抱着挑衅的态度举着无视法律和可耻的行为的旗帜，埃及呼吁全世界所有那些仍然关心人类的尊严和国际关系中的法治的人，派遣志愿军，运送军火或者给予其他方式的援助。
    埃及人民正在进行着生死存亡的战争。他们不仅仅是为了他们自己和他们的国家而战，同样也是为了文明世界而战。
    只要对埃及的侵略行动在不顾联合国的决议的情况下在它的领土上继续一天，埃及就得以无比的坚决和一切力量，为了尊严和值得生活的生活，对罪恶的力量继续斗争一天。
    它需要你们的援助。”
