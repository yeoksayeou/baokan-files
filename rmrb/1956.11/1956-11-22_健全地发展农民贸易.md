Sound Development of Farmer Trade

In recent months, nine provinces and regions, including Hebei, Hubei, Guangdong, and Fujian, have successively opened free markets under state leadership. Through these free markets, farmer trade has developed rapidly. The stagnation of primary markets has changed, the variety of commodities on urban and rural markets has increased, and some commodities that were previously unavailable can now be purchased. Consumers find it very convenient; farmers are even more satisfied. They see that this extensive exchange of materials can promote the diversified operations of agricultural production cooperatives. The development of farmer trade will undoubtedly promote state-owned commercial enterprises and supply and marketing cooperatives to improve their business management methods and do business better according to the needs of the masses.

Although farmer trade in various regions is still in its early stages of development, we have already seen some abnormal and noteworthy phenomena; in some individual places, it has even become chaotic. This is because many cadres and farmers have not clearly defined the boundaries of farmer trade in their minds, and do not understand what farmers should sell and what they should not sell, under what circumstances they should sell, and how they should sell.

Some cadres believe that "relaxing the management of rural markets and establishing free markets under state leadership" means adopting a completely laissez-faire attitude towards farmer trade. Therefore, they have completely relaxed the major issue of continuing to appropriately manage the market. As a result, some agricultural production cooperatives and farmers in these places have gone into business, some even abandoning agricultural production to engage in trade. The commodities they trade are very extensive, ranging from small local products, non-staple foods, and daily necessities to materials that the state controls for purchase. The areas they travel to are very widespread, from nearby villages and towns to neighboring counties and major cities in other provinces. Some agricultural production cooperatives have opened restaurants, hotels, and barbershops in market towns, slaughtering pigs and selling meat, practically becoming stationary merchants. In Fuqing County, Fujian Province, the number of fishermen who were originally 130 households suddenly increased to 2,000 after the free market was opened; Qinggaoshan Town Agricultural Production Cooperative in the county saw that trade was "free" and opened three tofu shops, two oyster cake shops, one grocery store, one fish ball shop, five candy stores, and two grocery stalls. Similar phenomena exist to varying degrees in areas where farmer trade has been developed.

The consequences of this approach are very bad. Some areas in Guangdong Province have suffered from drought threats, and some agricultural production cooperatives not only did not organize their members to rescue the drought-stricken fields, but instead drew a large number of people to engage in trade. How can these cooperatives not reduce production? After the opening of the free market in Shuidong Town, Dianbai County, Guangdong Province, the business volume of grocery and catering merchants in the town decreased by more than half due to the fact that agricultural production cooperatives and farmers were engaged in business. How can this situation be allowed to continue? There are also some farmers who actually demand to withdraw from the cooperative because they want to engage in business. Recently, in Fuqing County, Fujian Province, more than 500 agricultural production cooperative members requested to withdraw from the cooperative because they were engaged in business. Is this phenomenon not worthy of attention?

Some agricultural production cooperatives and farmers have not fulfilled their obligations to the state's unified purchase tasks and purchase and sales contracts, and have taken important industrial raw materials and export goods that the state controls for purchase to the market for "free trading," which seriously affects the completion of the state's purchase tasks. If this phenomenon is not stopped immediately, the state will not be able to fully control the materials it should control, the state's material distribution and usage principles will be undermined, many important materials will be used for secondary aspects, and the development speed of socialist industrialization will inevitably be affected. This is harmful to the country and to the farmers without any benefit.

The rural market is a free market under state leadership, and farmer trade is a supplement to socialist commerce. It is by no means an unmanaged free market. Farmers can only sell their own products when engaging in trade, and should never engage in trafficking and reselling goods; they can only sell their surplus products after completing the state's unified purchase and purchase tasks, and should never put private interests before public interests. That is to say, the scope of farmer trade is mainly small local products and sideline products produced by agricultural production cooperatives and farmers themselves, rather than grain, cotton, oil and major industrial raw materials and export goods purchased by the state under unified purchase. If agricultural production cooperatives and farmers have surplus grain, cotton and oil, they can only be taken to the market for sale after completing the state's unified purchase and purchase tasks. Farmers' trade activities that conflict with the lives of professional handicraftsmen and small vendors should be stopped.

The peasant masses are not familiar with the new type of farmer trade - free trade under the leadership of socialist commerce. What they are familiar with is the old-style capitalist free trade. In the upsurge of the socialist transformation of agriculture, the broad masses of peasants actively joined agricultural production cooperatives, which indicates that they are willing to take the socialist road; however, when encountering certain temptations and stimuli, some people will consciously or unconsciously waver between the two roads. Therefore, in the process of developing farmer trade, we should repeatedly and deeply carry out propaganda and education among farmers, explaining that developing farmer trade is beneficial to the country and to the farmers. However, if the path is taken wrongly, it will hinder the country's construction cause and also harm the farmers. There are countless examples in various regions of correctly developing farmer trade to benefit all aspects, and incorrectly developing farmer trade to harm all aspects. We should seize these concrete examples to educate the peasant masses on the two roads and clear up the farmers' thinking. We believe that on the basis of in-depth ideological education, continuing to strengthen necessary economic and organizational work, for example, restoring the original consignment sales "guozai hang" in various places as much as possible, establishing various forms of farmer service departments, etc., and simultaneously strengthening appropriate management of the rural market, farmer trade will inevitably develop healthily.

### 健全地发展农民贸易

    健全地发展农民贸易
    最近几个月来，河北、湖北、广东、福建等九个省区相继开放了国家领导下的自由市场。通过这些自由市场，农民贸易迅速发展起来。初级市场呆滞的现象改变了，城乡市场上的商品增多了，过去买不到的一些商品可以买到了。消费者觉着很方便；农民更是满意。他们看到，通过这种广泛的物资交流，能够促进农业生产合作社开展多种经营了。农民贸易的开展，无疑地将促进国营商业和供销合作社改进经营管理的方法，更好地按照群众的需要作生意。
    虽然各个地区的农民贸易还是刚刚发展，可是，我们已经看到了一些不正常的、很值得注意的现象；个别地方甚至搞乱了。这是由于许多干部和农民在思想上没有划清农民贸易的界限，不懂得农民应该卖什么，不应该卖什么？应该在什么情况下卖？应该怎样卖？
    有些干部认为“放宽农村市场管理，建立国家领导下的自由市场”，就是对于农民贸易完全采取放任自流的态度。因此，他们把应该继续适当地管理市场这个大问题完全放松了。于是，这些地方的一些农业生产合作社和农民就去经营商业，有的甚至放下农业生产来作买卖。他们贩运的商品很广泛，由小土产、副食品、日用百货到国家掌握收购的物资。他们走的地区很普遍，从附近村镇到邻县、外省的大城市。有些农业生产合作社在集镇开设饭铺、旅店、理发馆，杀猪卖肉，简直成了座商。福建省福清县原有渔贩一百三十户，自由市场开放以后，渔贩骤增到二千户；该县清高山镇农业生产合作社看到贸易“自由”了，就开了三个豆腐店、两个蛎饼店、一个杂货店、一个鱼丸店、五个糖果店、两个杂货摊。类似的现象，在开展了农民贸易的地区，都或多或少地存在着。
    这种作法的后果是很不好的。广东部分地区曾经遭受干旱威胁，有些农业生产合作社不但不组织社员抢救受旱的田禾，反而抽出大批人力去作买卖。这些合作社怎样能够不减产呢？广东电白县水东镇在开放自由市场以后，由于农业生产合作社和农民纷纷经营商业，镇上杂货和饮食业商贩的营业额下降一半以上。这种情形，怎么能够任它继续下去呢？还有某些农民居然因为要经营商业而要求退社。最近，福建省福清县一个县就有五百多户农业生产合作社社员因为经营商业而要求退社。这种现象难道还不值得注意吗？
    有些农业生产合作社和农民没有履行自己对国家的统购任务和购销合同所规定的任务，就把国家掌握收购的重要工业原料和出口物资拿到市场上去“自由买卖”，严重地影响了国家收购任务的完成。这种现象如不立即制止，国家就不能充分地掌握应该掌握的物资，国家的物资分配和使用原则就要被破坏了，许多重要的物资将要用于次要的方面，社会主义工业化的发展速度势必要受到影响。这对国家、对农民都是有百害而无一利的。
    农村市场是在国家领导下的自由市场，农民贸易是社会主义商业的一种补充，它绝不是无人管理的自由市场。农民进行贸易，只能销售自己的生产品，绝不应该贩运和倒卖商品；只能销售自己完成国家统购、收购任务以后多余的生产品，绝不应该先私后公。这就是说，农民贸易的范围，主要是农业生产合作社和农民自己生产的小土产和副业产品，而不是国家统购的粮食、棉花、油料和委托收购的主要工业原料和出口物资。农业生产合作社和农民如果有多余的粮食、棉花和油料等，只能在完成国家统购和收购任务以后再拿到市场出售。农民的贸易业务，凡是和专业的手工业者和小商贩有矛盾而影响到他们的生活的，都应该停止。
    对于新型的农民贸易——在社会主义商业领导下的自由贸易，农民群众是不熟悉的。他们所熟悉的是旧式的资本主义的自由贸易。在农业社会主义改造高潮中，广大农民踊跃加入农业生产合作社，这表示他们愿意走社会主义的道路；但是，遇到某种引诱和刺激，有些人在两条道路中间，就会自觉地或不自觉地动摇起来。因此，在开展农民贸易的过程中，应该反复地深入地向农民进行宣传教育，说明开展农民贸易，对国家、对农民都有好处。但是，如果把路子走歪了，对国家的建设事业有妨害，对农民也有妨害。各个地区都有无数正确地开展农民贸易使各方面获得好处、不正确地开展农民贸易对各方面发生害处的事例，应该抓住这些具体事例，向农民群众进行两条道路的教育，打通农民的思想。我们相信，在深入的思想教育的基础上，继续加强必要的经济工作和组织工作，例如，尽量恢复各地原有的经营委托收售业务的“过载行”，建立各种形式的农民服务部等等，对农村市场同时加以适当的管理，农民贸易就必然会健全地发展起来。
