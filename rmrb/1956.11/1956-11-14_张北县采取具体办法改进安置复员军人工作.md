Zhangbei County Adopts Concrete Measures to Improve the Work of Resettling Demobilized Soldiers

    (Our dispatch) Recently, the leading organs of Zhangbei County, Hebei Province, conducted a top-down inspection of the county's work on resettling demobilized soldiers. They criticized some leading comrades for being satisfied with the fact that over 95% of the demobilized soldiers were properly resettled, as well as bureaucratic work styles; they criticized the leading comrades of the County Food Company, Oil Company, Department Store Company, Grain Bureau, and Supply and Marketing Cooperative for not paying enough attention to the resettlement of demobilized soldiers; and they dealt with the relevant personnel who had made mistakes seriously, according to their respective situations.
    In order to thoroughly carry out the resettlement of demobilized soldiers, the Zhangbei County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party appointed two county committee members to take special responsibility and adopted effective measures. First, at the county's three-level enlarged cadre meeting, the significance of doing a good job in resettling demobilized soldiers was further clarified. It was required that each cadre should resettle two to three demobilized soldiers, and each district should designate a district committee member to be personally responsible. Then, the discovered problems were classified and listed, and handling opinions were put forward. After the meeting, seventeen cadres from relevant departments were organized to work with district and township cadres to conduct in-depth household inspections. At the same time, a forum for demobilized soldiers was held to solicit their opinions, and the spirit of the State Council and the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party on doing a good job in the resettlement of demobilized soldiers was widely publicized among the masses.
    On this basis, the leading organs of Zhangbei County further resolved the existing problems in the resettlement work and preferential treatment work. For example, after checking the preferential labor day work for families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers in each township, re-evaluation and subsidies were carried out, and deviations were corrected. In conjunction with autumn production, labor was arranged for demobilized soldiers. For the elderly, weak, and disabled, the "five guarantees" method was adopted, with the cooperatives taking care of them. The county also allocated 20,200 yuan for living subsidies and more than 3,400 yuan for house repairs. The Fifth District vacated seventy-seven public houses to resettle forty-four demobilized soldiers without houses or with housing shortages. The civil affairs and health departments signed a contract through consultation to ensure that demobilized soldiers could receive timely treatment for their illnesses; five demobilized soldiers with serious illnesses have been sent to sanatoriums in Beijing and Chengde for treatment. Forty-seven demobilized soldiers who were being tried out in various agencies have been converted into formal employees. The wages of eighty-eight demobilized soldiers employed throughout the county have been adjusted in conjunction with wage reform. Twenty-eight who were not suitable for agricultural production were placed in county-level units for employment. In addition, in order to strengthen the political and ideological leadership of demobilized soldiers, demobilized soldiers' education stations were established with the township as a unit.
    As a result of the above measures, all 2,044 demobilized soldiers in Zhangbei County have been properly resettled. (Zhang Zhiheng, Zhao Hui)

    张北县采取具体办法改进安置复员军人工作
    本报讯　最近，河北省张北县领导机关对全县安置复员军人的工作自上而下地作了检查。批判了有些领导同志满足于95％以上复员军人安置妥当的思想和工作中的官僚主义作风；批评了不重视复员军人安置工作的县食品公司、油脂公司、百货公司、粮食局、供销社等五个单位的领导同志；并对犯了错误的有关人员，分别情况，作了严肃处理。
    为了彻底作好复员军人的安置工作，中共张北县委会确定了两名县委委员实行专责领导，并且采取了有效措施。首先，在县三级扩大干部会上，进一步阐明了作好复员军人安置工作的意义，要求每个干部要安置好二至三名复员军人，每区指定一名区委委员专人负责；接着把发现的问题分类排队提出了处理意见。会后，又组织了有关部门十七名干部协同区、乡干部深入到户进行检查，同时，召开了复员军人座谈会，征求了他们的意见，在群众中也广泛地宣传了国务院和中共河北省委关于做好复员军人安置工作指示的精神。
    在这个基础上，张北县领导机关对安置工作和优抚工作中存在的问题，又作了进一步的解决。如对烈、军属优待劳动日工作，在逐乡进行了检查之后，重新进行了评议、补助，有偏差的做了纠正。结合秋季生产，安排了复员军人的劳动，对老弱残疾采取“五保”办法由合作社包起来。全县还拨发了生活补助费二万零二百元，修房费三千四百多元，第五区腾出七十七间公产房，安置了无房和缺房的四十四名复员军人。民政和卫生部门通过协商签订合同，保证复员军人的疾病能够及时得到治疗；有五名病情严重的复员军人，已经分别送到北京、承德疗养院治疗。在各机关四十七名被试用的复员军人已转为正式职工。全县就业的八十八名复员军人，结合工资改革调整了工资。有二十八名不适合从事农业生产的，安置到县级单位就业。另外，为了加强对复员军人的政治思想领导，又以乡为单位建立了复员军人教育站。
    由于采取了以上措施，张北县二千零四十四名复员军人都得到了妥善的安置。（张志恒、赵辉）
