    Farmer Trade Service Department
    Zhao Zechi
    Nanxiangdian is a market town located in the hilly area of southern Guangshan County, Henan Province. In the surrounding area, sideline income for farmers accounts for approximately 60% of their total agricultural and sideline income. Sideline production mainly consists of bamboo and wooden wares. Besides meeting the needs of farmers within the county, these products are also sold to parts of Henan and Anhui provinces. Mountain goods (mainly bamboo, wood raw materials and finished products) from the neighboring mountainous counties of Xinxian and Macheng are also sold here, thus forming a mountain goods distribution market of "selling from the south and buying from the north."

    Nanxiangdian has a market day every other day. The volume of mountain goods, bamboo, and wood products on the market is large, and the goods cannot all be sold on the same day. Farmers are accustomed to entrusting the remaining goods to commercial firms for consignment sales. Therefore, the business of market firms has been very prosperous over the years. In the first quarter of 1955, the value of products entrusted by farmers to commercial firms for consignment sales reached more than 34,000 yuan, accounting for 66% of the total farmer trade.

    Since agricultural cooperativization and the socialist transformation of private commerce, the farmer trade market has undergone significant changes: on the one hand, the sellers of agricultural and sideline products have changed from individual farmers to agricultural cooperatives. Although the number of people attending the market has decreased (from more than a thousand people per market day in the past to just over a hundred people after agricultural cooperativization), the quantity of products to be sold remains large. On the other hand, due to the transformation of private commerce, many merchants engaged in trading and transportation have been squeezed out. As a result, although there are many goods to sell in the market, there are few buyers, which prolongs the sales time, and more products remain unsold on market day. This situation has caused great inconvenience to farmer trade, and farmers urgently demand the restoration and establishment of consignment sales services.

    In response to the farmers' demands, the Nanxiangdian Supply and Marketing Cooperative organized 46 (46 people) old commercial firms into a farmer trade service department at the beginning of this year. The service department is divided into groups for raw bamboo and wood and waste goods (used clothing, old furniture), bamboo and wood finished products and charcoal, feed, and groceries to handle consignment sales, which facilitates farmer trade. In the first quarter alone, the consignment sales volume reached 15,500 yuan, accounting for half of the total farmer trade in the same quarter.

    Since the winter and spring of last year, the exchange of goods in the rural market has experienced some blockages, and the bamboo and wood products purchased by the supply and marketing cooperative have resulted in a large backlog. However, after organizing the farmer trade service department and utilizing its advantages of wide contact and flexible sales methods, these stockpiled goods quickly found sales channels.

    The Nanxiangdian Farmer Trade Service Department accepts the consignment of sideline products from agricultural cooperatives or farmers, mainly through the following four methods: First, selling at the market (this is the main consignment method); Second, transacting within the service department on non-market days; Third, for slow-moving goods, organizing small traders or service department personnel to conduct short-distance trading sales; Sometimes, with the seller's consent, short-term (no more than one month) credit sales are adopted to mobilize small traders for external sales; Fourth, for out-of-stock products, actively contacting agricultural cooperatives to find sources of goods.

    Through organizational rectification and ideological transformation education for trading personnel, the farmer trade service department has changed the capitalist business style of the past commercial firms and established new operating management systems. First, accounting and storage systems have been established. Each consignment sales group has an accountant and a warehouse keeper, each with specific responsibilities. Incoming goods are first recorded in the books and then handed over to the warehouse keeper for storage in a specific location, with the depositor, quantity, and price marked. The accountant issues a receipt for the sale of goods, which is then presented to the warehouse keeper for retrieval. An inventory of goods is taken before the market opens and after it closes, and accounts are settled after the market closes. This avoids the past incidents of selling the wrong farmer's deposited goods, selling more than was sold, and long-term defaulting on payments. Second, the price of consignment products is based on the standard price set by the supply and marketing cooperative, and the transaction clerk assesses the quality with the seller's consent, thus avoiding the past phenomenon of transaction clerks arbitrarily raising prices, lowering prices, and deceiving the masses. Third, in the past, the handling fee for farmers to sell through commercial firms was 10%, borne by both buyers and sellers. After the establishment of the farmer trade service department, the handling fee for raw bamboo and wood and finished products, charcoal, feed, and waste goods has been reduced to 5%, and groceries to 4%, which is closer to reasonable. In addition, the farmer trade service department has also established a monthly award system to encourage trading personnel to work actively and improve service quality. The service department has only experienced two losses in the past four months. When service department personnel go to the countryside on non-market days, they generally take the initiative to contact agricultural cooperatives to organize sources of goods. In mid-May, farmers from Huangchuan came to buy woodenware, but the service department was out of stock. The trading personnel immediately contacted the agricultural cooperative and sold more than 40 loads of woodenware on consignment, satisfying the purchasing and sales needs of the farmers.

    The consignment sales business is conducted in the farmer trade market, and it is also affected by the production season and has seasonal changes. From the perspective of turnover, the annual bamboo and wood product operating situation is roughly as follows: peak season 45%, normal season 33%, off-season 32%. In order to arrange for the production and living difficulties of trading personnel during the off-season, the Nanxiangdian Supply and Marketing Cooperative organized them to transport goods for the supply and marketing cooperative on non-market days and to collect waste products in the villages, each person can earn more than 4 jiao per day, which basically solves their living difficulties and enables them to focus on serving farmer trade.

    The Nanxiangdian Farmer Service Department has improved its operation and management and established the idea of serving farmer trade, and has been welcomed by the masses of farmers.

    农民贸易服务部

    南向店是河南省光山县南部丘陵地带的一个集镇，附近地区农民副业收入占农副业总收入的60％左右。副业生产以竹木器为主，产品除供给本县农民需用外，还远销河南和安徽省的部分地区。临近山区新县、麻城的山货（主要是竹、木原料和成品）也多来这里销售，因此，形成了“南来卖，北来买”的山货集散市场。
    南向店每隔一天有一个集日，山货、竹、木产品上市量大，商品不能当天全部卖掉，农民都习惯把剩余部分委托行栈代销。所以，历年来集市行栈业务很兴盛。1955年第一季度农民委托行栈代销产品的金额即达三万四千多元，占农民贸易总额的66％。
    自从农业合作化和对私营商业实行社会主义改造以后，农民贸易市场曾经发生了重大的变化：一方面是，出售农副产品的，已经由个体农户变为农业社了，赶集的人虽然少了（以往每集有千余人，农业合作化以后，减少到一百多人），但要出售的产品数量仍旧很多；另方面，由于对私营商业实行改造以后，许多从事贩运的商贩被挤掉了。结果市上要卖的货虽多，要买的人却很少，因而销售时间拖长，当集卖不掉的产品更多了。这种情况给农民贸易带来很大不便，农民迫切要求市场恢复与建立代销业务。
    南向店供销合作社根据农民要求，曾在今年年初把当地四十六户（四十六人）旧的行栈业组织起来，建立了农民贸易服务部。服务部下分设原竹木和荒货（估衣、旧家俱）、竹木成品和木炭、饲料、杂货等组，分别办理代销业务，便利了农民贸易。仅第一季度代销额即达一万五千五百元，占同季度农民贸易总额的一半。
    去冬今春以来，农村市场的物资交流曾经发生了一些阻塞现象，供销合作社收购起来的竹木产品造成了很大积压。但组织农民贸易服务部后，利用其联系面广、推销方法灵活多样等优点，这些积压的物资也迅速打开了销路。
    南向店农民贸易服务部接受农业合作社或农民委托代销副业产品，主要采取以下四种方式：一、在集市市场出售（这是主要的代销方式）；二、背集在服务部内成交；三、滞销品，组织小商贩或服务部人员进行短途贩运销售；有时在卖主同意下，还采取短期（不超过一个月）赊账的办法，动员小商贩外销；四、脱销品、主动与农业合作社联系，寻找货源。
    经过组织整顿和对交易人员的思想改造教育，农民贸易服务部改变了以往行栈业的资本主义经营作风，并建立了新的经营管理制度。首先是建立了账务和保管制度。每个代销业务组都有司账员、保管员各负专责。来货先登账再交保管员存放在一定位置，并标明存户和数量、价格。卖货由司账员开票交保管员提取。每集开市前和散集后，都进行一次货物盘点，散集后结算账目。这样就避免了以往常常发生的卖错农民存货和以多卖少、长期赖账不偿还货款的事件。其次，代销产品的价格是根据供销合作社制定的标准价格，在卖主同意下，由交易员按质量好坏评议的，因而避免了以往交易员任意抬价、压价、欺骗群众的现象发生。第三、过去农民通过行栈代销手续费是10％，由买卖双方负担。成立农民贸易服务部以后，竹木原料和成品、木炭、饲料、荒货手续费已调低为5％，杂货为4％，这就比较接近合理了。另外，农民贸易服务部还建立了每月评奖的制度，鼓励了交易人员积极工作，提高服务质量。服务部四个月来只发生过两次丢失差错。服务部人员在背集下乡时，一般都主动地和农业合作社联系组织货源。5月中旬潢川农民来买木器，而服务部缺货，交易人员随即和农业社联系，代销木器四十多担。满足了农民的购销要求。
    代销业务是在农民贸易市场上进行的，它又受生产季节的影响而有季节变化。如从交易额看，全年竹木产品经营情况大致比例如下：旺季45％，平季33％，淡季32％。为了安排交易人员淡季的生产、生活上的困难，南向店供销合作社组织他们在背集为供销运货，串乡收购废品，每人每天可收入四角以上，基本上解决了生活困难，使他们能安心于为农民贸易服务。
    南向店农民服务部由于改进了经营管理，树立了为农民贸易服务的思想，受到了农民群众的欢迎。
