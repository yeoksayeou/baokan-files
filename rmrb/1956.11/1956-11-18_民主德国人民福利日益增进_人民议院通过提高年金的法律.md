Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, November 17th. The People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic passed a law on increasing pensions at a plenary session held on the 16th. This law will come into effect on December 1st this year. According to this new law, 3.6 million people out of the five million families in the German Democratic Republic will be able to receive old-age pensions, disability pensions, and various subsidies.

This law was unanimously adopted based on the draft law submitted by the government of the German Democratic Republic. The Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic, Otto Grotewohl, made a report at the meeting of the People's Chamber on the significance and characteristics of this draft law and other bills related to social welfare. Grotewohl said that this new measure by the government marks a new victory and further economic development for all working people in the German Democratic Republic. He pointed out that after the implementation of the new law, the percentage of expenditures on various pensions and social relief funds in the national budget will increase from the current 9.4% to 12.2%. This shows that under the banner of socialism, the society of the German Democratic Republic is developing soundly towards a better life and accelerating social progress.

He said: The Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany has recently received more than 5,000 letters from people receiving pensions, who unanimously expressed their satisfaction with the draft law on increasing pensions. After the implementation of the law on increasing pensions, the rationing system in the German Democratic Republic will also be abolished.

    民主德国人民福利日益增进
    人民议院通过提高年金的法律
    新华社柏林17日电　德意志民主共和国人民议院在16日举行的全体会议上通过了关于提高年金的法律。这项法律将从今年12月1日起开始生效。根据这项新的法律，在民主德国的全体居民的五百万个家庭中，将有三百六十万人可以领到养老年金、残废年金和各种不同的补助金。
    这项法律是根据民主德国政府提出的法律草案一致通过的。民主德国总理格罗提渥就这项法律草案和其他有关社会福利的法案的意义和特点在人民议院的会议上作了报告。格罗提渥说，政府的这项新措施标志着民主德国全体劳动人民的新胜利和经济的进一步发展。他指出，在施行新的法律后，国家预算中关于各种年金和社会救济金的支出所占的百分比将从现在的9.4％，增加到12.2％。这表明在社会主义旗帜下，民主德国的社会向着更加美好的生活的健全发展和社会的加速进步。
    他说：德国统一社会党中央委员会最近期间收到了领年金的人寄来的五千多封信件，他们一致对提高年金的法律草案表示满意。在提高年金的法律实施以后，民主德国的配给制度也将要取消。
