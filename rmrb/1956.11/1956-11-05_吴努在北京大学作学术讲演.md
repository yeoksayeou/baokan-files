Xinhua News Agency, November 3rd: U Nu, Chairman of the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League of Burma, gave an academic lecture on Buddhism at Peking University this morning. The audience included teachers and students from Peking University, the Chinese Buddhist Academy, and figures from Chinese Buddhist circles, totaling more than 1,200 people.

When Chairman U Nu and his wife, accompanied by Yang Xiufeng, Minister of Higher Education, and Ma Yinchu, President of Peking University, appeared on the podium, the audience stood up and applauded warmly to welcome them.

Ma Yinchu first delivered a speech to welcome Chairman U Nu to Peking University to give an academic lecture, saying: Chairman U Nu is not only a great peace fighter and an outstanding statesman, but also a scholar with profound research in Buddhism. Buddhism is one of the most important religions in Asian countries, and it occupies an important position in the cultural exchanges of Asian countries. The Chinese people attach great importance to the study of Buddhism, and Chairman U Nu's lecture on Buddhism will undoubtedly provide great help to the study of Buddhism in China.

Chairman U Nu then gave a lecture entitled "What is Buddhism." Chairman U Nu said that the religious beliefs in the world today can be divided into two categories: theistic beliefs and atheistic beliefs. According to theistic beliefs, there is an eternal heaven. The god who rules this heaven is also eternal and has the power to accomplish all things. The Buddha's teachings are an atheistic concept. According to the atheistic concept, the entire universe, including the sun, moon, stars, mountains, trees, and all living things, was not created by God. What exists in the universe is the human mind. The purpose of Buddhism is to end all the suffering of birth, old age, sickness, and death. The Buddha's teachings are to liberate all beings from this suffering.

Chairman U Nu then elaborated on the Śīla (precepts), Samādhi (concentration), and Prajñā (wisdom) in the Buddha's teachings, and said that if any of the listeners wish to seek the truth of Buddhism, he can invite them to Burma to stay as state guests for three months. Chairman U Nu said, you only need to stay for three months, and I can guarantee that during this period you can attain a very important initial state of Prajñā.

After the lecture, Chairman U Nu, his wife, and accompanying personnel visited the physics department laboratory, the library, and the Pavlov Higher Nervous Activity Laboratory of Peking University.

    吴努在北京大学作学术讲演
    新华社3日讯　缅甸联邦反法西斯人民自由同盟主席吴努今天上午应邀到北京大学作了关于佛学的学术讲演。听讲的有北京大学、中国佛学院的教师和学生，中国佛教界人士等一千二百多人。
    吴努主席和夫人，周恩来总理由高等教育部部长杨秀峰、北京大学校长马寅初陪同出现在讲台的时候，听讲的人们起立热烈鼓掌表示欢迎。
    马寅初首先致词欢迎吴努主席到北京大学作学术讲演，他说：吴努主席不仅是一个伟大的和平战士、卓越的政治家，而且是一位对于佛学有深刻研究的学者。佛教是亚洲各国最重要的宗教之一，它在亚洲各国的文化交流中占着重要的地位。中国人民十分重视对佛学的研究，吴努主席的这次关于佛学的讲演，必将对中国的佛学研究提供巨大的帮助。
    吴努主席接着作了题为“什么是佛教”的讲演。吴努主席说，今天世界上的宗教信仰，可以分为有神的信仰和无神的信仰两大类。根据有神信仰的说法，有一个永存不坏的天堂。统治这个天堂的神也是永存不灭的，而且具有完成一切事物的权力。佛陀的教义是无神的概念。根据无神的概念来说，整个宇宙、包括日月星辰、山川树木和一切生物在内，都不是神创造的。在宇宙之中存在的就是人的心。佛教的目的就是要终止生老病死这一切痛苦，佛陀的教义也就是要使一切众生解脱这些痛苦。
    吴努主席接着详尽地论述了佛陀教义中的尸罗（戒）、三摩地（定）、般若（慧），并且说，听讲者中有人愿意寻求佛教真理，他可以邀请他们到缅甸去作为国家的客人住三个月。吴努主席说，你们只需要去住三个月就够了，我可以保证，在这个期间你们可以证到非常重要的般若初境。
    吴努主席在讲演以后，和他的夫人及随行人员等一同参观了北京大学的物理系实验室、图书馆和巴甫洛夫高级神经活动实验室。
