    With Soviet Aid
    Thanh Hoa Power Plant in Vietnam Completed
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, November 25th: The Democratic Republic of Vietnam has recently completed a power plant in Thanh Hoa City, more than 170 kilometers south of Hanoi. This is the second power plant built this year with Soviet assistance, the first being the power plant at the Phu Tho Tea Factory, completed in October.
    Construction on the Thanh Hoa Power Plant, which has a generating capacity of 600 kilowatts, began in April of this year. The plant is equipped with new Soviet-style machinery and has good ventilation and sanitation facilities. During the construction process, Soviet experts have trained more than 100 technicians.
    The Thanh Hoa Power Plant will soon begin generating electricity, which will be sufficient to supply the people of Thanh Hoa City with electricity for lighting. Thanh Hoa City originally had a power plant, but it was destroyed ten years ago at the start of the war of resistance against France.
    The Nghi An Power Plant, which is being built with Soviet assistance, will have ten times the generating capacity of the Thanh Hoa Power Plant. Power plants in Lao Cai and Viet Tri are also planned to begin construction next year.

    在苏联援助下
    越南清化电厂完工
    新华社河内25日电　越南民主共和国最近又在河内以南一百七十多公里的清化市建成一个发电厂。这是在苏联帮助下今年建成的第二个发电厂，第一个是在10月份完工的富寿茶厂的发电厂。
    在今年4月动工的清化发电厂的发电能力是六百瓩。厂内安装有苏联的新式机器，有良好的通风和卫生设备。在建厂过程中，苏联专家已经培养出一百多个技术工人。
    清化发电厂即将在最近开始发电，它将能充分供应清化市人民照明用的电力。清化市原来有一个发电厂，但在十年前抗法战争开始时就被破坏了。
    在苏联援助下正在修建的还有宜安发电厂，它的发电能力将比清化发电厂大十倍。还有老街和越池两地的发电厂也计划在明年动工。
