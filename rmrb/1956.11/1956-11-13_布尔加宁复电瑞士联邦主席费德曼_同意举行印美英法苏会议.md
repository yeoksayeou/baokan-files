    布尔加宁复电瑞士联邦主席费德曼
    同意举行印美英法苏会议
    新华社12日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁11日电复瑞士联邦主席费德曼，同意在瑞士召开有印度参加的美、法、英、苏首脑会议。电文说，苏联政府确信一切争端必须用和平方式解决，并且相信各国政府首脑的直接会谈对和平事业是有好处的，因此欢迎瑞士关于在瑞士境内立即召开美、法、英、苏四国政府首脑和有印度政府首脑作为万隆会议参加国代表参加的会议的建议，并且表示愿意参加这次会议。
    费德曼是11月6日致电布尔加宁的。他在电文中说，带有悲惨后果的第三次世界大战的危险笼罩着人类。但是，和平是可以而且应当得到拯救的。为此，瑞士联邦委员会坚决呼吁立刻举行曾经于1955年7月在日内瓦举行的美、法、英、苏四国政府首脑会议，印度政府首脑可以作为万隆会议参加国的代表参加这次会议。
    会议可以在瑞士联邦境内举行。
