Xinhua News Agency, London, November 1st: British Communist Party Chairman Harry Pollitt and General Secretary John Gollan issued a statement on behalf of the party on October 31, saying: "The decision of the Labour Party Parliamentary Group to resist the Conservative government's evil adventure in the Middle East by all constitutional means should be supported in all regions, all working-class organizations, and workers' workplaces.
    Unless the Conservative government's policy is stopped, British soldiers will die in a meaningless war in Egypt.
    The statement accused the Conservative government of shedding the blood of Britons, Arabs, and Jews in order to consolidate its imperialist interests in the Middle East, and demanded the immediate withdrawal of all British troops from the Suez Canal area and an immediate ceasefire in that area. The statement also called for an early general election to allow the Labour Party, which opposes the government's Middle East policy, to return to power.
    Xinhua News Agency, November 1st: According to TASS, Paris, October 31st: The Political Bureau of the French Communist Party issued a statement on the Mollet government's policy in the Near East, protesting against the French and British governments' war against Egypt and protesting against Israel's aggression against Egypt.
    The statement first discussed the French and British ultimatum to Egypt, saying that this unreasonable and premeditated action by France and Britain could expand the war to the entire Near East, worsen the situation in Algeria and North Africa, and could lead to the outbreak of a new world war.
    The statement said, our country, our people are on the verge of catastrophe. This policy, which is fatally harmful to our country, seriously violates the wishes of the working class and all the people as clearly expressed in the results of the January 2, 1956 (National Assembly election). The French Communist Party expresses its serious protest against the war actions taken by the French and British governments.
    The statement said that national interests require condemning Israel's aggression, demanding that the troops used to land in Egypt be returned to France, and that the French fleet be returned to its Toulon base. The interests of the nation require a negotiated solution to the Suez Canal issue based on the six principles endorsed by the Security Council.
    The statement said that the working class and the French people, who have already suffered the serious consequences of the Algerian war, are now anxious because they think that the action of invading Egypt may ignite the flames of a third world war, thus bringing unpredictable disasters.
    The moment has come for the working class, democrats, and patriots to unite to stop the evil actions of the warmongers.
    The moment has come for the working people who support the Communist Party and the Socialist Party to unite and resolutely defend peace.
    People in factories, construction sites, and offices, people in cities and villages, unite and remind those forgetful parliamentarians of the promises they made on January 2nd, reminding them that the French people do not want war.
    The French Communist Party is convinced that it expresses the feelings of the vast majority of the people, that it is acting in the interests of the nation, and that it can accomplish the task of stopping the war.

    英法两国共产党分别发表声明
    号召人民制止政府侵略埃及的冒险
    新华社伦敦1日电　英国共产党主席哈里·波立特和总书记约翰·高兰10月31日代表党发表声明说：“工党议会党团决定要以一切宪法手段来抵抗保守党政府在中东的罪恶冒险，这种决定应该在一切地区、一切工人阶级的组织和工人的工作地点中得到支持。
    保守党政府的政策除非被制止，否则英国士兵将在在埃及进行的毫无意义的战争中死亡。
    声明指责保守党政府为了要巩固它在中东的帝国主义利益而让英国人、阿拉伯人和犹太人流血，并且要求立刻把全部英国军队撤出苏伊士运河地区，立刻在那个地区停火。这项声明也要求提前举行大选，使反对政府的中东政策的工党重新执政。
    新华社1日讯　据塔斯社巴黎10月31日讯：法国共产党政治局就摩勒政府对近东的政策发表声明，抗议法国和英国政府对埃及进行战争，并且抗议以色列侵略埃及。
    声明首先谈到法国和英国进军埃及的最后通牒，它说，法英两国这种无理的、事先周密策划的行动可能使战争扩大到整个近东，使阿尔及利亚和北非的局势恶化，可能导致新的世界大战的爆发。
    声明说，我们国家，我们人民处于浩劫的边缘。这种对我国有致命危害的政策严重违反工人阶级和全体人民在1956年1月2日（国民议会选举）选举结果中所明显地表明的愿望。法国共产党对法国和英国政府所采取的战争行动表示严正抗议。
    声明说，国家利益要求谴责以色列的侵略行动，要求把用来在埃及登陆的军队调回法国，把法国舰队调回自己的土伦基地。国家的利益要求根据安全理事会所赞同的六项原则通过谈判方式解决苏伊士运河问题。
    声明说，工人阶级和已经经受到阿尔及利亚战争的严重后果的法国人民现在感到惶惶不安，因为他们想到侵略埃及的行动可能燃起第三次世界大战的火焰，从而带来难以预计的灾祸。
    工人阶级、民主人士和爱国人士团结起来制止战争贩子的罪恶行动的时刻来到了。
    拥护共产党和社会党的劳动人民团结起来坚定不移地保卫和平的时刻来到了。
    工厂、工地、机关里的人们，城市和乡村的人们，联合起来，提醒那些健忘的议员们在1月2日所作的诺言，提醒他们法国人民不要战争。
    法国共产党深信，它表达了绝大多数人民的感情，它在按照国家的利益行动，它能够完成阻止战争的任务。
