Xinhua News Agency, November 27th, TASS Cairo, November 26th: The Egyptian "People's News" citing reports from Damascus, revealed in detail the conspiracy against Syria plotted with the participation of Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Said.

    The newspaper wrote that the conspiracy was planned to be implemented in three stages. The first stage was to create chaos, provocations, and sabotage in Syria, and to kidnap Syrian leaders. All of this was originally prepared to drive armed bandits to do when the British, French, and Israeli forces invaded Egypt.

    Then, Said attempted to declare the entry of Iraqi troops into Syria under the pretext of "guaranteeing security" and safeguarding Iraq's "oil interests" in Syria. At the same time, Israeli troops also attacked Syria.

    The newspaper pointed out that if this conspiracy succeeded, Said intended to appoint Iraqi Crown Prince Abdul Ilah as the Vice-King of Syria. Said also planned to hand over Gaza and Jerusalem to Israel and allow the Jordan River diversion project to be realized. The newspaper said that Syrian authorities had already arrested many conspirators in the country and intercepted a large number of British-made weapons.

    Xinhua News Agency, November 27th, Amman News: The Jordan Army Headquarters issued a communique on the evening of the 26th, stating that the Jordanian public security forces had discovered a large number of weapons and ammunition in some tribes. The communique said that the weapons found were a type of German rifle, the same as the rifles used by the Israeli army.

    According to Jordan Radio, Jordanian and Syrian security authorities are jointly investigating cases of smuggling arms in the Syria-Jordan border area.

    According to a Cairo radio broadcast on the evening of the 25th, all British officials working for the Jordanian government have resigned.

    Xinhua News Agency, November 27th, Washington News: Iraqi Ambassador to the United States, Musa Shabandar, visited William Rountree, Assistant Secretary of State for Middle Eastern Affairs, on the 26th and requested the United States to ship more military supplies to Iraq.

    据约旦电台广播说，约旦和叙利亚治安当局正在共同调查在叙利亚—约旦边界地区私运军火的案件。
    另据开罗电台25日晚上广播，所有为约旦政府工作的英国官员已经全部辞职。
    新华社27日讯　华盛顿消息：伊拉克驻美国大使穆萨·沙班达尔26日拜访了美国负责中东事务的助理国务卿威廉·朗特里，要求美国向伊拉克运送更多的军用物资。
