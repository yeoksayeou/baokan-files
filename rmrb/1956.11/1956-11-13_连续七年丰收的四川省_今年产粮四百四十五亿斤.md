Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu Telegram: The Sichuan Provincial Planning Commission announced yesterday that Sichuan Province, which ranks first in the country in terms of grain output, achieved a total grain output of 44.5 billion jin this year, an increase of 10% compared to the bumper harvest of 1955. Thus, this province, which has achieved consecutive good harvests for seven years, has reached its 1957 provincial grain production target one year ahead of schedule and exceeded it by 6.5%.

This year is the first year that Sichuan Province has realized agricultural cooperation. The head of the agricultural department of Sichuan Province believes that this is of decisive significance for this year's grain increase. On the basis of nearly 200,000 agricultural production cooperatives composed of more than 80% of farmers, the province promoted effective advanced cultivation techniques such as "rational fertilization" and "appropriate close planting" of rice, and "artificial auxiliary pollination" of corn on tens of millions of mu of farmland this year. On the other hand, this year, the province implemented intercropping and crop rotation on a large scale, and changed the one-season and two-season harvests into two-season and three-season harvests in a year. The area of double-cropping rice alone increased from more than 80,000 mu last year to more than 4 million mu, which alone increased rice production by about 700 million jin this year.

The head of the agricultural department said that on the basis of cooperation, farmers throughout the province expanded the irrigated area by 9.12 million mu through water conservancy construction this year; water storage and irrigation was implemented on more than 1.56 million mu of dry land, and the amount of natural fertilizer applied to the fields increased by 50% to 100% compared to last year through mass fertilizer accumulation and production activities. The state's investment of more than 39 million yuan (more than double last year's) in agriculture, forestry, water conservancy, and meteorology in the province is also an important factor in this year's grain increase.

    连续七年丰收的四川省
    今年产粮四百四十五亿斤
    新华社成都电　四川省计划委员会昨天宣布：粮食产量占全国第一位的四川省，今年的粮食总产量达到了四百四十五亿斤，比丰收的1955年增产了10％。至此，这个连续七年粮食都获得丰收的省份，已提前一年并超额6.5％达到了1957年的全省粮食产量计划指标。
    今年，是四川省实现了农业合作化的第一年。四川省农业部门的负责人认为这一点对今年的粮食增产具有决定的意义。在由80％以上的农户组成的近二十万个农业生产合作社的基础上，全省今年在上千万亩的田地上推行了水稻的“合理施肥”、“适当密植”，玉米的“人工辅助授粉”等行之有效的先进耕作技术。另一方面，今年全省大规模地实行了间作、套作和改一年收一季、两季为一年收两季、三季的耕作制度改革。单是双季稻，就由去年的八万多亩增加到四百多万亩，仅此一项今年就增产了稻谷七亿斤左右。
    农业部门的负责人说，在合作化的基础上，今年全省农民通过兴修水利扩大了灌溉面积九百一十二万亩；在一百五十六万多亩旱地上实行了蓄水浇灌，通过群众性的积肥、造肥活动，在田地上施用的自然肥料比去年增加50％到一倍。国家用于全省农林、水利、气象方面的三千九百多万元的投资（比去年增长一倍多），也是今年粮食增产的重要因素。
