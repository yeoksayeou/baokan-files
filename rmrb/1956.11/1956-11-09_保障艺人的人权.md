The Party and the government's emphasis on and care for the arts have greatly encouraged artists' enthusiasm for serving the people and their initiative in artistic creation. However, in some areas, a few cadres still regard theatrical troupes as "old opera troupes" and actors as "actors," "lowly people," and, with the "noble" airs of "official masters," create difficulties for the troupes everywhere. Even cases of infringement on human rights are still numerous. We should speak out for the artists and further expose these egregious phenomena.

Here I cite a few extremely infuriating incidents: Example 1: On March 7th of this year, when the Quyang County Pingju Opera Troupe of Hebei Province went to the material exchange fair in Taitou Village, Ding County Fifth District, to perform, Liu Shutang, a village cadre (member of the village Party branch), asked the ticket seller Liu Liping for a "red ticket." Because the ticket had been taken to the tax office in Zhuanlu Village, twelve li from Taitou Village, to be stamped and had not been returned, the ticket seller asked Liu Shutang to wait a moment. Liu Shutang then rudely ordered the troupe to stop performing (which he did not succeed in doing), and ticket sales were halted for forty minutes. The troupe leader apologized to him, but he ignored it. At the same time, he demanded that the troupe issue forty armbands to cadres and militiamen. Incited by him, four or five hundred people rushed into the theater without tickets, causing great disorder, and the troupe only sold two hundred and seventy-five tickets. The next night, Wang Lao Xi, Li Shuchun, and others jumped in from over the wall. When troupe members came out to stop them, they gathered many backward elements and threw stones, bricks, and clods of earth at the stage, damaging the gas lamps and injuring more than twenty actors, including Chen Jinmei, Li Jingshan, Wang Xiaoniu, Zhang Shuqin, and Yang Gaiying. At that time, the troupe asked the cadres to deal with this matter, but the cadres said, "There is no way." Subsequently, the troupe caught Li Shuancheng, Lü Huaiqing, Xin Yuankun, and others (all from the village) on the spot throwing stones at the stage and handed them over to the township people's committee, but the township people's committee released these people without taking any action. The next night, many people ran to the theater door and shouted loudly, "Even if we are handed over to the government, nothing will happen to us!" Incited by these people, nearly a hundred people jumped into the theater together, disrupting order.

Example 2: On the evening of July 30th of this year, when the Huai'an County Arts and Crafts Huai Opera Troupe of Jiangsu Province was performing in Qigong Town, Haoqu District, Zhi Guangyu (a Party member), Zhi Xiaohua (a League member), Zhi Xiaonan, Zhi Xiaojin, Zhi Xiaoyuan, and five others from the Xizhi Agricultural Production Cooperative in the town, planned to buy three half-price tickets. They entered the theater in two groups. The first group of five said the tickets were with the second group, while the second group of four said the first group of five had nothing to do with them. When the ticket taker Xian Xiuying (a woman) refused to let them enter, Zhi Guangyu and others grabbed her and beat her on the spot, dragging Xian Xiuying to the side and punching her several times in the chest, causing her severe chest injuries. After the "mediation" of the town's instructor, the troupe leader was asked to apologize to them and invite them to watch the play. But Zhi Guangyu and others were still not satisfied. On the afternoon of August 3rd, when the troupe went to Machang to perform and passed the Xizhi Agricultural Production Cooperative, Zhi Guangyu and others deliberately gathered more than a hundred people and ambushed them around the main road. When the troupe members arrived, Zhi Zhongyou shouted to attack through a megaphone, and the more than one hundred people ambushing around rushed up, injuring more than ten actors, including Lu Yuhua (a woman who was three months pregnant), who was kicked in the lower abdomen several times by a man named Zhi Guangwen and fainted on the spot, remaining unconscious for several hours and suffering a miscarriage after being taken to Qigong Town Hospital. Sun Bin was beaten until his head was bleeding; the actress Lin Xiuying was beaten and vomited blood on the spot, and was also rushed to the hospital for emergency treatment.

These are just two examples of serious violations of law and discipline and infringements on human rights; as for incidents of deliberately making things difficult for artists, there are even more.

Artists, like other people in society engaged in other work, should have their human rights guaranteed by national laws and discipline. However, we still hear about artists being oppressed and discriminated against from time to time. We cannot help but ask: Where have the relevant leading comrades of the local government gone? Why are they turning a blind eye to these things?

    保障艺人的人权
　　魏镇清
    党和政府对艺术事业的重视和爱护，大大鼓舞了艺人们为人民服务的热情和艺术创造上的积极性。但在某些地区，仍有少数干部把剧团看成“旧戏班子”，把演员看成“戏子”，“下贱人”，而以“高贵”的“官老爷”作风，处处给剧团以刁难；甚至侵犯人权的事情，也仍有不少。我们应该替艺人鸣不平，对这些恶劣现象有进一步加以揭露的必要。
    这里我举出几件令人十分愤慨的事情：例子之一：河北省曲阳县评剧团今年3月7日到定县五区台头村物资交流大会演出时，乡干部刘树堂（乡党支部委员）向售票员刘利平要“红票”，因为票拿到距台头村十二里的砖路村税务所盖章，没有取回来，售票员让刘树堂稍等一会，刘树堂就蛮横无理地勒令剧团停演（未逞），当时曾停止售票四十分钟。剧团负责人向他道歉，他也不理。同时要求剧团发给干部和民兵佩条四十个。在他的鼓动下，有四五百群众无票拥入剧场，秩序大乱，剧团只卖了二百七十五张票。次日晚场，又有王老喜、李树春等人从墙头跳入，剧团人员出来制止，他们纠合落后分子多人，用石头、砖头、土块向舞台上乱掷、砸坏了汽灯，还打伤演员陈金梅、李敬山、王小牛、张淑琴、杨改英等二十余人。当时剧团要求干部对这事加以处理，干部却说：“没有办法”。随后剧团当场抓住向台上掷石头的李拴成、吕怀庆、辛元昆等人（都是该村人），交到乡人民委员会，但乡人民委员会没有作任何处理就把这些人释放了。第二天晚场又有多人跑到剧场门口大声喊道：“交到政府也没有把我们怎样！”在这些人鼓动下，又有近百人一齐跳入剧场，破坏秩序。
    例子之二：江苏省淮安县艺工淮剧团今年7月30日晚在郝渠区钦工镇演出时，该镇西支农业生产合作社的支广雨（党员）、支效华（团员）、支效南、支效金、支效元等九人，计划好买了三张半票，分两批进场，前一批五人说票在后面，后一批四人却说前面五人同他们无关。检票员咸秀英（妇女）不让他们入场，支广雨等当场抓住就打，并将咸秀英拖至一旁照着她的胸部打了数拳，咸秀英胸部受伤很重。经过该镇指导员的“调解”，要剧团负责人向他们道歉，并请他们看戏。但支广雨等还不甘休，8月3日下午，剧团到马厂演出，经过西支农业生产合作社时，支广雨等有计划地纠集百余人埋伏在大路四周，当剧团人员走到时，支忠友拿着喇叭筒喊打，四周埋伏的百余人一拥而上，打伤演员十余人，其中陆玉花（已怀孕三月的妇女）被一个名叫支广文的照准她小肚子踢了几脚，当时昏倒在地，几个小时不省人事，抬入钦工镇医院后就流产了。孙斌被打的头破血流；女演员林秀英被打的当场吐血，也都被抬入医院急救。
    这只是举了两件严重的违法乱纪，侵犯人权的实例；至于对艺人故意刁难的事件就更不在少数了。
    艺人，和社会上从事其他工作的人们一样，他们的人权应该受到国家法纪的保障。可是艺人受到欺压、歧视的事，却仍然时有耳闻，我们不能不问：当地政府的有关领导同志到那里去了呢？为什么对这些事情置若罔闻呢？
