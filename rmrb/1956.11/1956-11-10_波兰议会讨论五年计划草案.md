Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, November 9th: According to a report from the Polish News Agency, the Polish Parliament began discussing the draft of the Five-Year Plan (1956-1960) at its November 8th session.

During the day's discussions, speakers addressed issues such as the development of agriculture and the democratization of rural life, the supply of raw materials to industry, foreign trade, and the democratization of People's Councils.

In his speech, Deputy Jaworski argued that it was absolutely necessary to change the investment system for state-owned farms, replacing the past practice of grants with loans. At the same time, state-owned farms should be granted full autonomy and guaranteed a necessary number of agricultural experts. He also suggested merging some departments managing agriculture and forestry into one department. In the future, the work of the Ministry of Agriculture should be to determine agricultural policy rather than to manage agriculture.

Deputy Ignar, Deputy Chairman of the Polish Council of Ministers and Chairman of the United Peasants' Party, emphasized in his speech that it was correct to dissolve those weak agricultural cooperatives whose output was lower than that of individual farmers and all those that existed in name only. However, it would be short-sighted and wrong to rashly dissolve collective farms with development prospects. Ignar pointed out that the United Peasants' Party would support the further development of agricultural cooperatives while also supporting the development of individual farmers.

Deputy Majkowska criticized the system of supplying raw materials to industry and other issues.

Other deputies spoke on issues of foreign trade and the democratization of People's Councils.

    波兰议会讨论五年计划草案
    据新华社华沙9日电　据波兰通讯社报道：波兰议会在11月8日的会议上开始讨论五年计划（1956—1960）草案。
    在这一天的讨论中，发言者谈到了有关农业发展和农村生活的民主化、对工业的原料供应、对外贸易和人民会议的民主化等问题。
    议员雅沃尔斯基在发言中认为绝对有必要改变对国营农场的投资制度，即用贷款给国营农场的方式来代替过去那种赠与的习惯做法。同时，应该给予国营农场充分的自治，并且保证供给它们必要数量的农业专家。他还建议把管理农业和林业的一些部合并为一个部。今后农业部的工作应该是决定农业政策而不是经营农业。
    波兰部长会议副主席、统一农民党主席伊格纳尔议员在发言中强调说，解散那些产量低于个体农户的、薄弱的和所有空有其名的农业合作社是正确的，但是，轻率地把有发展前途的集体农庄也加以解散，则是缺乏远见和错误的。伊格纳尔指出，统一农民党在支持农业合作社的进一步发展的同时，将支持个体农户的发展。
    马伊科夫斯卡议员对工业原料的供应制度等问题提出了批评。
    其他议员就对外贸易问题和人民会议实行民主化的问题发了言。
