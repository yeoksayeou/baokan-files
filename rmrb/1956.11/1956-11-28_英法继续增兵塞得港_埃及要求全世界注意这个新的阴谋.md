    British and French Continue to Reinforce Troops in Port Said
    Egypt Calls on the World to Pay Attention to This New Conspiracy
    Xinhua News Agency, November 27th - Cairo News: The Egyptian Information Department issued a communique on the evening of the 26th, calling on the world to pay attention to the fact that Britain and France are still sending new troops to land in Port Said. The communique said: "It is hoped to make the world aware of the fact that, despite the United Nations resolution passed on November 24th by almost all United Nations member states stipulating the immediate withdrawal of all invading troops from Egypt, news agencies are still reporting that new enemy troops and motorized units are landing in Port Said."
    Xinhua News Agency, November 27th - London News: The "Daily Herald" published a dispatch from its Near East correspondent Pitts on the front page on the 26th with a large headline saying, "A French tank regiment landed in Port Said on November 25th via motorized landing craft, thus further strengthening the powerful British and French forces."
    Pitts pointed out that Britain and France are massing troops on a large scale in Port Said. He wrote, "Port Said is extremely crowded, and even the lawns in the city center have been used as British army camps."
    The British Ministry of Defense said it was unaware of the French tank reinforcement situation. A French Ministry of Defense spokesman also declined to confirm or deny the news.
    Xinhua News Agency, November 27th - Beirut News: According to a broadcast by Beirut Radio on the 25th, the Egyptian official in charge of Port Said said that rebuilding Port Said, which was destroyed by the British and French aggressor troops, requires nearly ten million Egyptian pounds in funding.
    The Egyptian official also said that approximately three thousand Egyptian residents were killed and eight hundred were injured during the British and French army's attack on Port Said.

    埃及要求全世界注意这个新的阴谋
    新华社27日讯　开罗消息：埃及情报司26日晚发表公报，要求全世界注意英法仍在派遣新的军队在塞得港登陆。公报说：“希望让全世界注意这样的事实：尽管几乎全体联合国会员国在11月24日通过的联合国决议规定所有侵略军队立即撤出埃及。各通讯社仍然报道，敌方新的部队和摩托化部队正在塞得港登陆”。
    据新华社27日讯　伦敦消息：“每日先驱报”26日在第一版以大字标题刊载驻近东记者皮茨的通讯说，“一个法国坦克团11月25日坐机动登陆驳船在塞得港登陆，这样就更加加强了英法的强大部队。”
    皮茨指出，英法在塞得港大规模集结军队，他写道，“塞得港拥挤极了，甚至市中心的草地上也安扎了英国军队的军营。”
    英国国防部说，它不知道有关法国坦克部队增援的情况。法国国防部发言人也拒绝证实或者否认这个消息。
    新华社27日讯　贝鲁特消息：据贝鲁特电台25日广播，塞得港的埃及负责官员说，重建被英法侵略军破坏的塞得港，需要近一千万埃及镑的资金。
