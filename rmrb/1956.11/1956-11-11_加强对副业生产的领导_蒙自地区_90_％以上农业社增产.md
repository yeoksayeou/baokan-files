    Strengthen Leadership in Sideline Production
    Over 90% of Agricultural Cooperatives in Mengzi Area Increase Production
    (Our report) After the Mengzi area of Yunnan Province strengthened leadership over rural sideline production, over 90% of cooperatives increased their income. Before the summer rectification campaign, over 1,400 agricultural cooperatives in the area generally experienced a one-third reduction in sideline production due to neglect of leadership in this area. In July, the Mengzi Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened a conference on sideline production for the entire area, conscientiously studying issues such as production, supply, and sales in sideline production. Various counties also summarized and inspected the progress of sideline production, exchanged experiences, and further resolved ideological obstacles and specific difficulties in developing sideline production. Each county also established sideline production offices and groups to specifically manage the leadership of sideline production. Since August, the proportion of cooperatives not engaged in sideline production has dropped from 61% of the total to 18%, and the number of projects managed by agricultural cooperatives has also increased compared to before, with some cooperatives engaging in as many as twenty or more types of activities. The sideline income of many cooperatives is around 7,000 yuan; some reach 30,000 yuan.

    加强对副业生产的领导
    蒙自地区90％以上农业社增产
    本报讯　云南蒙自地区加强对农村副业生产的领导后，使90％以上的社增加了收入。全区一千四百多个农业社在夏季整社前，由于忽视对副业生产的领导，致使社的副业生产一般减少三分之一。7月间，中共蒙自地委，召开了全区副业生产会议，认真地研究了副业生产中的产、供、销等问题。各县也总结检查了副业生产开展的情况，交流了经验，进一步解决了开展副业生产中的思想阻碍和具体困难。各县还成立了副业生产办公室及小组，专管副业生产的领导。8月份以来，没有开展副业生产的社已由占总数的61％降为18％，农业社经营的项目也较前增多了，有的社多至二十多种。许多社的副业收入在七千元左右；有的达三万元。
