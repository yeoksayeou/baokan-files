From Local Newspapers:

    Should Give Members "Private Plots"
    On August 26th, this newspaper summarized the discussion in the Henan Daily about whether or not members of agricultural producers' cooperatives should have "private plots." This discussion ended on September 15th.

    During the discussion, some believed it was not good for members to have "private plots," saying that "'private plots' are a stumbling block to building socialism" and "the root of generating capitalism." However, the majority believed that members should be given "private plots" because "private plots" are allocated to members according to a certain proportion of land, and the quantity is very small. Capitalism won't develop much with such a small "private plot." Jiao Changsheng and others, members of the Red Flag Agricultural Cooperative in Lingbao County, cited the example of the Red Flag Cooperative to illustrate the disadvantages of not giving members "private plots": After the Red Flag Cooperative transitioned to an advanced cooperative in January of this year, some cooperative cadres, exhibiting a "socialist style" and fearing that "private plots" would create "roots of small-scale peasant economy," abolished "private plots," allocating 150 mu of paddy fields from the collective land to grow vegetables. This caused a lot of trouble. During the wheat harvest, farm work piled up, and no team could spare the time to transport vegetables. It wasn't until the wheat harvest was almost complete that they managed to deliver cartloads of old cucumbers and old chives to each team. The members reflected, "Haven't seen vegetables for half a month, now they send a mountain of them. Can't eat them in a day, and they stink the next day." Those who smoked had no place to grow tobacco leaves and had to cultivate small patches of land in the yard or by the threshing ground. They said discontentedly, "Looks like this pipe will have to be hung up." The cadres also felt many difficulties. Each time vegetables were distributed, each team had to send a cart, some having to travel six or seven li. After a long day of labor, the team leader had to distribute and weigh the vegetables in the evening, and the accountant had to keep track of every half-jin or four liang, going through several procedures, leaving them unable to sleep until midnight. Now, the cooperative cadres shake their heads when these things are mentioned. Those who previously advocated against private plots now regret their mistake. Reader Dou Deye said in his article that because the Baishan Agricultural Cooperative in Bo'ai County did not give members "private plots," members had to buy vegetables in the market every day. To buy vegetables, members had no money and had to borrow from the cooperative. If they couldn't borrow, they were naturally dissatisfied, resulting in disunity between members and cadres.

    The editorial department of the Henan Daily finally concluded the discussion. The editorial department pointed out: The advanced agricultural producers' cooperative model charter stipulates that agricultural cooperatives should allocate a certain amount of land to members for growing vegetables and encourage and help members operate necessary household sideline occupations. This provision is based on consolidating the cooperative and taking into account the actual needs of individual members. Because agricultural cooperatives cannot fully take care of the daily lives of members, members should be allowed to have a small amount of "private plots" and engage in some household sideline production to regulate members' lives, invigorate members' household economy, and solve the problem of members' daily vegetable consumption and pocket money, so that members can eat satisfactorily and live happily. By appropriately taking care of the personal interests of members, the collective interests of the agricultural cooperative can be easily consolidated and developed.

    The editorial department of the Henan Daily believes that some cooperative cadres' view that "private plots" are "the root of selfishness and self-interest" and "a stumbling block to building socialism," and therefore disagreeing with allocating "private plots" to members, is one-sided and wrong. The current social situation has undergone fundamental changes. The main means of production for farmers are all collectively owned, socialist large-scale production has become the main mode of production, and farmers' ideological awareness has also undergone significant changes. Under these circumstances, there is no need to worry about farmers having a small "private plot." Of course, if members have "private plots" and management and arrangements are improper, it may conflict with the collective production of the cooperative. How to solve this possible conflict? On the one hand, it is necessary to constantly conduct collectivist education for members and help members appropriately arrange their labor time in "private plots"; on the other hand, it is necessary to discuss with members and formulate necessary rules. As long as the rules are reasonable and sound, and the management is thorough, the conflict can be completely resolved.

### 应该给社员分“自留地”

    应该给社员分“自留地”
    8月26日，本报曾摘要介绍了河南日报关于农业生产合作社社员该不该有“自留地”的讨论。这一讨论已于9月15日结束。
    在讨论当中，有的认为社员有“自留地”不好，说“‘自留地’是建设社会主义的绊脚索”，是“产生资本主义的根子”；但大多数人都认为应该给社员“自留地”。因为“自留地”是按土地一定的比例留给社员的，数量很少；凭那么一小块“自留地”，资本主义发展不到那里去。灵宝县红旗农业社社员焦长胜等，举红旗社的实例说明不给社员“自留地”的坏处：红旗社在今年1月转高级社以后，由于部分社干部讲“社会主义派头”，并且怕“自留地”生“小农经济根子”，把“自留地”取消了，由社内公有土地中抽出一百五十亩水田种菜。这一下可惹起了许多麻烦。收麦的时候，农活积成圪?，叫哪队运菜，哪队都顾不着。直到麦快收完，才抽点空把老黄瓜、老韭菜一车一车送给各队社员。社员反映：“半月不见菜，送来积成堆，一天吃不了，隔天臭难闻”。会吸烟的人因为没地方种点烟叶，只得在院内场边开点地来种。他们不满意地说：“看这烟袋得挂起来了”。干部也感到很多困难，每次分菜，各队要派车，有的要跑六七里路。菜拉回来，队长白天劳累一天，晚上还得分菜、称菜，会计还得陪着上账，半斤四两也得经过几道手续，弄得半夜不能睡觉。社干部现在一提起这些事都摇头，过去主张不留的人，也后悔作错了。读者豆德叶在他的文章中说，博爱县柏山农业社由于没有给社员“自留地”，社员每天吃菜都得到市上买，要买菜，社员没有钱就向社里借，借不到手自然就不满意，结果形成了社员和干部的不团结。
    河南日报编辑部最后对这个讨论作了结论。编辑部指出：农业社抽出一定数量的土地分配给社员种菜，鼓励并帮助社员经营必要的家庭副业，都是高级农业生产合作社示范章程上作了规定的。这规定是从巩固合作社和照顾社员个人的实际需要出发的。因为农业社对社员的日常生活不可能完全照顾到，应该让社员有少量“自留地”和经营一些家庭副业生产，以调剂社员生活，活跃社员家庭经济，解决社员日常吃菜和零花钱问题，让社员吃得如意，过得愉快。适当照顾社员个人利益，农业合作社的集体利益也就容易巩固和发展。
    河南日报编辑部认为：有些社干部提出“自留地”是“自私自利的根子”，是“建设社会主义的绊脚索”，因而不同意给社员分配“自留地”，这种看法是片面的、错误的。目前社会情况已有了根本变化，农民的主要生产资料全为集体所有，社会主义大生产已成了主要生产方式，农民的思想意识也有了显著变化。在这种情况下，农民有一小块“自留地”是不用耽心害怕的。当然，社员有了“自留地”，如果管理和安排不当，是会和社的集体生产发生矛盾的。怎样解决这个可能发生的矛盾呢？一方面，要经常向社员进行集体主义教育，并帮助社员适当安排在“自留地”里劳动的时间；另一方面，要和社员共同商量，订出必要的制度。只要制度订得合理、健全，管理得周到，矛盾是完全可以解决的。
