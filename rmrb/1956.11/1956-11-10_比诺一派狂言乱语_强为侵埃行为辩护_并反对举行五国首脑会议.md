Xinhua News Agency, November 9th dispatch from Paris: The French National Assembly's Foreign Affairs Committee held a meeting on November 8th to hear a report from Foreign Minister Pineau regarding the Middle East situation.

It was revealed that Pineau, in his speech, tried his best to defend the act of aggression against Egypt. He described Israel's attack on the Sinai Peninsula as an act of "self-defense," and said that he did not believe that the issue of Israel's borders could be resolved by retreating to the 1948 Israel-Egypt armistice line.

Pineau expressed "in principle" his approval of the plan for an "international emergency force" organized by small and medium-sized countries under the auspices of the United Nations. However, he also said that the United Nations had made "mistakes" in its handling of the matter, as it only considered the military aspects of the problem without taking into account its political significance.

Pineau said that Britain and France had not yet achieved "all their goals" in Egypt. He indicated that one of these goals was to establish "international control" of the canal.

Pineau expressed his rejection of the Swiss government's proposal for a meeting of the heads of state of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, France, and India to discuss the Middle East situation.

    比诺一派狂言乱语
    强为侵埃行为辩护
    并反对举行五国首脑会议
    新华社9日讯　巴黎消息：法国国民议会外交委员会11月8日举行会议，听取外交部长比诺关于中东形势的报告。
    据透露，比诺在发言中竭力为侵略埃及的行为辩护。他把以色列进攻西奈半岛说成是一种“自卫行动”，并且说，他并不认为以色列的边界问题可以用退到1948年以色列—埃及停战线后面的办法来解决。
    比诺表示“在原则上”赞成在联合国主持下由中小国家组织“国际紧急部队”的计划。但是他又说，联合国方面办事有“错误”，它只考虑了问题的军事方面，而没有考虑到问题的政治意义。
    比诺说，英法两国还没有达到它们在埃及的“所有的目标”。他表明，这些目标之一就是建立运河的“国际管制”。
    比诺表示拒绝瑞士政府提出的由苏、美、英、法和印度五国政府首脑举行会议讨论中东局势问题的建议。
