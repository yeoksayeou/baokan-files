Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, November 17th: The Jingzhou Special District of Hubei Province is currently carrying out a review of grain unified sales work to correct the abnormal phenomenon of a month-by-month increase in grain sales. According to statistics from the Special Commissioner's Office Grain Bureau, from July to early November, the district's grain sales increased by 29% compared to the same period last year, which is more than 47.7 million jin of grain sold. Since the summer and autumn harvests, most parts of the district have achieved bumper harvests, and various grains have been entering the market one after another. However, grain sales have not gradually decreased with the entry of grain into the market; on the contrary, they have increased dramatically month by month.

According to an inspection by the Jingzhou Special Commissioner's Office at a recent joint meeting of county heads, the reasons for the abnormal increase in grain sales are mainly that leading organs and cadres at all levels have developed complacency towards grain work, believing that this year's harvest is good, collectivization has been achieved, and there are no problems with grain. In order to ensure the completion of grain tasks, grain departments at all levels have only focused on unified purchase and have relaxed leadership over unified sales. Some grassroots cadres, when compiling unified sales plans, did not mobilize the masses and correctly implement grain policies, but instead sat in their offices and calculated figures behind closed doors. Many peasant households were supplied when they should not have been, and those who should have been supplied less were supplied more. They blindly shouted to their superiors to demand an increase in supply quotas. The management of grain supply for urban residents, institutions, enterprises, and schools has also become increasingly lax, fueling the trend of collective units and residents hoarding grain and wasting large amounts of grain.

When reviewing grain unified sales work, all localities have emphasized starting from the actual situation, ensuring reasonable supply, supplementing supplies that are too tight, and reducing supplies that are too high to a reasonable level through full consultation, ensuring that the masses are willing. According to the results of the review in key villages, the masses are satisfied with the reasonable adjustment of excessively high or low grain supplies, and the supply volume has decreased compared to before.

Judging from the grain supply situation in Jingzhou District in early November, although only a few areas have been reviewed, and the review work in most areas has just begun, the sales rate (compared with the same period last year) has significantly decreased compared to September and October.

### 减缩不必要的销量、保证合理供应  荆州专区复查粮食统销工作

    减缩不必要的销量、保证合理供应
    荆州专区复查粮食统销工作
    新华社武汉17日电　湖北省荆州专区正在展开对粮食统销的复查工作，纠正粮食销售量逐月上升的反常现象。据专署粮食局统计，全区从7月到11月上旬，粮食销售量比去年同期增加29％，即多销了四千七百多万斤粮食。夏秋以来全区绝大部分地区获得了丰收，各种粮食陆续登场，但是粮食销售量没有随着粮食登场而逐步下降，相反地月月剧增。
    据荆州专署最近召开各县县长联席会议的检查，粮食销售量不正常地增加的原因，主要是各级领导机关和干部对粮食工作产生了麻痹思想，认为今年丰收了，合作化了，粮食没有问题了。各级粮食部门为了保证完成粮食任务，只抓住了统购一头，放松了对统销工作的领导。有些基层干部编造统销计划时，不是通过发动群众，正确地贯彻执行粮食政策，而是坐在屋里关门算账，许多农户不该供应的供应了，该少供应的多供应了，对上级却盲目叫喊要求增加供应指标。各城镇居民和机关、企业、学校的粮食供应，管理工作也越来越松弛，助长了各集体单位和居民积存粮食和大量浪费粮食的风气。
    各地在对粮食统销工作进行复查时，都强调从实际情况出发，保证合理供应，对供应偏紧的补足，对供应偏高的通过充分协商，使群众自愿减到合理程度。据各地在重点乡村复查的结果，群众对于粮食供应偏高偏低加以合理调整感到满意，供应量较前减少了。
    从荆州全区11月上旬的粮食供应情况来看，虽然经过复查的还只有少数地区，大部地区的复查工作刚刚开始，但是销售率（和去年同期比较）已比9、10月份有显著下降。
