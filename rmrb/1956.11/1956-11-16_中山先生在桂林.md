Mr. Sun Yat-sen assumed the position of Grand President in Guangzhou in May 1921. This was the result of the Extraordinary Session of the National Assembly and the reorganization of the Republic of China government—what is known in modern history as the "Protection of the Constitution Movement."

At that time, the reactionary government in the north used money and military supplies to buy off and aid the Guangxi warlord Lu Rongting. Lu Rongting wanted to recover his lost territory in Guangdong, so he pandered to the northern government and listened to its instigation. However, he was soon defeated. Mr. Sun Yat-sen ordered the Yue Army of Xu Chongzhi, the Gan Army of Li Liejun, the Xiang Army, the Yunnan Army and Guizhou Army accepting Mr. Sun Yat-sen's command, and the Guangxi Army that defected to welcome Mr. Sun Yat-sen into Guangxi to launch a multi-pronged attack, disintegrating Lu Rongting's decade-long reign of power. Mr. Sun Yat-sen then stationed himself in Guilin to prepare for the Northern Expedition. Mr. Sun Yat-sen only brought a guard regiment with him; the rest consisted of troops gathered from Jiangxi, Guangxi, Yunnan, and Guizhou.

The people of Guilin greeted Mr. Sun Yat-sen's arrival like "a great drought longing for rain clouds," comparable to the people's cry of "Why is our ruler so late in coming? His coming will bring us relief!" when Tang was about to conquer Ge:

	The imperial envoy arrives from afar, bringing spring to the Guilin hills.
	Why has the great man arrived so late? The masses rejoice together!
	Laugh at Xu's rebellious defiance of the legitimate government and his treacherous schemes, all in vain.
	We look forward to the arrival of the righteous army to eliminate the national traitors and celebrate peace!
	Don't you see Lu in Wuming: harming Guangxi and devastating its people, he ends up self-immolated.
	Don't you see Tan, Chen, and Mo: engaging in reckless warfare and exhausting the people's resources, they all flee.
	In the end, might is defeated, and people's rights prevail,
	The Five-Power Constitution and the Three Principles of the People are honored.
	Welcome our meritorious leader!

This song, "All Circles of Guilin Welcome President Sun," may not be a unique copy today, but probably not many people know it. "Xu the rebel" and "the false court" in the lyrics refer to Xu Shichang and the reactionary government in the north; "Lu in Wuming" is "Lu Rongting," a native of Wuming, Guangxi; "Tan, Chen, and Mo" are the Guangxi warlord Tan Haoming, the then Governor of Guangxi; Chen Bingkun, the Military Governor of Guangxi; and Mo Rongxin, the Military Governor of Guangdong.

Mr. Sun Yat-sen lived in the Wangcheng (Prince's City) of Guilin—the former palace of the princes of the Yuan and Ming dynasties, the examination hall for provincial examinations in the Qing dynasty, and the provincial assembly in the early Republic of China. Now, the Guangxi Normal University is located here. —Among them is a large auditorium built entirely of steel, constructed during the time of the provincial assembly. This is the only auditorium in Guilin, and the citizens call it the "Iron House." Mr. Sun Yat-sen lectured on his "Five-Power Constitution" in this Iron House. Many people came to listen, and it was more crowded than ever since the "Iron House" was built: the windowsills were full of people, and faces were pressed against the windows from the outside. Children occasionally went with adults, and the gatekeepers were not strict. Usually, there were very few women's footprints here, but now they appeared, looking for Madam Sun Yat-sen, Comrade Song Qingling. Guilin was alive!

Children could catch crickets in the Yu Huang Ge (Jade Emperor Pavilion) of the Wangcheng's back garden without being scolded;

The sound of the wooden clappers of the horse-hoof cake vendors echoed in the city gates without being forbidden;

Citizens saw Mr. Sun Yat-sen sitting in a "bright sedan chair" coming out of Zhengyang Gate, passing Wangfuping, and exiting Wenchang Gate to visit Elephant Trunk Hill and see the crossing point of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom army during their northern expedition without any street closures.

Guilin was happy!

On both sides of the Zhengyang Gate inside the Wangcheng, from the end of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom war to 1921, had probably served as a garbage dump for decades, with dung and rubbish piled up into two large mounds. When Mr. Sun Yat-sen arrived, he ordered the guards to clear it away, revealing a pair of Yuan dynasty stone lion carvings that had long been buried. Although the Wangcheng's back garden (similar to Beihai Park's relation to the Forbidden City in Beijing) contained Duxiu Peak, one of the "top under heaven" mountains, it was secluded, desolate, and rarely visited. When Mr. Sun Yat-sen arrived, he instructed the guards to build a road in their spare time. The several hundred-meter-long straight road from the right side of Donghua Gate to the ancient plum tree next to the Yu Huang Ge was the first road opened by Mr. Sun Yat-sen in Guilin. Mr. Sun Yat-sen was the first person to break ground when this first road was built.

After Mr. Sun Yat-sen passed away, the people of Guilin converted the Wangcheng's back garden into "Zhongshan Park." At the end of this road is Zhongshan Hall, and behind the hall is Yangzhi Pavilion, also commemorating Mr. Sun Yat-sen. These gardens, halls, pavilions, and trees commemorating Mr. Sun Yat-sen were later occupied, demolished, and leveled by the Kuomintang's provincial government!

Mr. Sun Yat-sen arrived in Guilin in early autumn and returned to Guangzhou in early winter. At that time, he changed his route to Shaoguan for the Northern Expedition. Before long, he was met with Chen Jiongming's rebellion. This is another matter.

Some of the people who followed Mr. Sun Yat-sen at that time have died; some are today in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Guilin...engaging in the socialist cause that Mr. Sun Yat-sen idealized, in commemoration of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's ninetieth birthday; but there are also those who are stranded in Taiwan, residing in Hong Kong, in that place "separated by a strip of water," where "a single reed can sail across," there should be people who "turn back to the shore."

    中山先生在桂林
    陈迩冬
    1921年5月，中山先生就非常大总统职于广州。这是当时国会开非常会议、改组了中华民国政府的结果。——近代史上所称的“护法之役”。
    其时，北方的反动政府以金钱、军火收买和接济了桂系军阀陆荣廷。陆荣廷想恢复他失去的广东地盘，于是阿附北廷，听其嗾使。但不久即被击溃。中山先生命许崇智的粤军、李烈钧的赣军和湘军、接受中山先生指挥的滇军和黔军、倒戈以迎中山先生入桂的桂军分路进攻，瓦解了陆荣廷十年的统治势力。于是中山先生进驻桂林，布置北伐。中山先生仅带来一个警卫团，其余则结集了赣、桂、滇、黔的队伍。
    桂林人民对于中山先生的到来，真像“大旱望云霓”，想像汤伐葛时，人民叫出“奚我后，后来其苏”迎接汤的到来，不过如此：
    跸节兮遥临，桂岭兮生春。君子奚至迟？万众齐欢腾！笑徐逆抗命伪廷卖国计空逞，指日义师到，消除国贼庆升平！不见武鸣陆：祸桂残民终自焚；不见谭、陈、莫：黩武穷兵尽逃奔。到头来还是强权失败民权胜，五权、三民主义尊。欢迎我元勋！
    这一只“桂林各界欢迎孙大总统”的歌，今天虽算不得“海内孤本”，知道的人怕不多了。歌词中的“徐逆”“伪廷”，指徐世昌和北方反动政府；“武鸣陆”，即“陆荣廷”他是广西武鸣人；“谭、陈、莫”，是桂系军阀谭浩明，当时的广西省长；陈炳焜，广西督军；莫荣新，广东督军。
    中山先生住在桂林王城——这儿是元、明两朝藩王的故宫，清代乡试的贡院，民国初年的省议会。现在广西师范学院设此。——其中有一座全部钢材建筑的大礼堂，是省议会时修盖的，这是桂林城中唯一的一座礼堂，市民称之为“铁房子”，中山先生就在这个铁房子里开讲他的“五权宪法”。听的人很多，自有“铁房子”以来没有这样拥挤过：窗台上坐满了人，窗子外也脸靠着脸。小孩也偶有跟着大人去的，门禁并不森严。平时这儿很少有妇女的足迹，这时也出现了，她们是去找孙夫人宋庆龄同志的。桂林，活了！
    儿童在王城后苑玉皇阁捉蟋蟀，没有被斥逐；
    卖马蹄糕的在城洞把搭板打得一阵响，没有被禁止；
    市民们看到中山先生坐着“亮轿”从正阳门出来，过王辅坪出文昌门去游象鼻山，看太平天国军队北上时的渡江处；没有戒道。
    桂林，幸福了！
    王城的正阳门内两侧墙隅，从太平天国战后到1921年，大概做了几十年的垃圾处，粪草、破烂堆成了一边一座大丘。中山先生来了，他叫卫士清除了它，这里就出现了久被埋没的一对元代石刻的狮子。王城后苑（略同于北京北海之于故宫）虽有“甲天下”山之一的独秀峰在其内，但幽僻荒芜，人迹罕到。中山先生来了，他指点卫士公余筑路，从东华门内右侧一直到玉皇阁前古梅圯那一条几百米的直道，便是中山先生开辟的桂林第一条马路。这第一条马路开筑时第一个下锄头的，是中山先生。
    中山先生逝世后，桂林人民把王城后苑改建为“中山公园”。这条马路尽头是中山堂，堂后是仰止亭，也是纪念中山先生的。这些纪念中山先生的园、堂、亭、树，后来竟被国民党的省政府圈占、拆毁、平夷了！
    中山先生是秋初到桂林，冬初返广州的。那时他改道韶关北伐。未久即遭到陈炯明的叛乱。这是题外的事了。
    当时追随中山先生的人们，有的死了；有的今天正在北京、在上海、在广州、在桂林……在纪念中山先生的九十诞辰，从事中山先生理想的社会主义事业；但也还有的困顿台湾、栖迟香港，那“一水之隔”“一苇可航”之地，该有“回头是岸”之人吧。
