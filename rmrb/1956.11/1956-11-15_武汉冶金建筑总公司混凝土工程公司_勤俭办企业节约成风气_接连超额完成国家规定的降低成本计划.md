Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, November 13th: The leadership and employees of the Wuhan Metallurgical Construction Corporation's Concrete Engineering Company have been running the enterprise diligently and thriftily, achieving significant results.

This engineering company relocated from Northeast China to Wuhan in April of this year to undertake some construction projects for the Wuhan Iron and Steel Joint Enterprise. As it was a new establishment with large expenses, it suffered a loss of more than 60,000 yuan in the second quarter of this year. However, from July to October, this engineering company, adhering to the principle of running the enterprise diligently and thriftily, carried out various cost-saving activities and successively exceeded the state-mandated cost reduction plan, and also compensated for the losses of the second quarter in installments.

Due to the emphasis of the company's leadership, since the third quarter, reducing costs and saving construction materials have become mass actions throughout the company. The company's Party Committee has repeatedly studied the financial cost work of the enterprise. The Party Congress held in September also listed saving construction materials and reducing costs as one of the main contents of the current advanced producer movement. All construction sites have also fully implemented the economic accounting of work teams, and a system for strengthening cost analysis and management has been established from the company to the construction sites. Thanks to the active rationalization proposals and adoption of various new technologies by the employees, this engineering company has saved a large amount of steel, wood, and cement. More than 60 percent of the company's engineering and technical personnel have also put forward rationalization proposals. The modification of a culvert design jointly proposed by engineer Tang Yunwen and young technicians Cai Dehui and Yu Zhongmin alone saved steel bars and cement worth 40,000 yuan while ensuring the quality of the project.

A thrifty and calculating atmosphere of saving has been formed at each construction site. The vast number of employees often collect and utilize bamboo, wood, iron nails, reed mats, etc., discarded on the construction site. At the Gujiashan Quarry construction site, builders have already used discarded wood to process batches of doors, windows, roof trusses, and other temporary facilities needed for the project. In the past, when dismantling scaffolding, scaffolders always used knives to cut the ropes tying the scaffolding, but now they have changed to dismantling the scaffolding by untying the ropes, which has greatly improved the utilization rate of the ropes. In order to prevent iron nails from being scattered on the construction site, carpenters now remove the nails while dismantling the concrete formwork.

Builders also pay attention to using local materials and saving transportation costs when selecting building materials. After research, they adopted the crushed stone stripped from the construction site quarry and the yellow sand near the construction site instead of the crushed stone and yellow sand that were originally designed to be transported from other places, while ensuring the quality of the project. In this way, the price of each cubic meter of crushed stone was reduced by two-thirds, and the price of each cubic meter of yellow sand was reduced by 95%.

    勤俭办企业节约成风气
    接连超额完成国家规定的降低成本计划
    新华社武汉13日电　武汉冶金建筑总公司混凝土工程公司领导方面和职工勤俭地办企业，作得很有成效。
    这个工程公司是今年4月从东北迁来武汉，担任武汉钢铁联合企业一些建设工程的。因为是新摊子，开支大，今年第二季度曾经赔累六万多元。但是从7月到10月，这个工程公司由于本着勤俭办企业的方针，多方面开展节约活动，接连超额完成了国家规定的降低成本计划，还分期补偿了第二季度的亏损。
    由于公司领导方面的强调，从第三季以来，降低成本和节约建筑材料已经成为全公司群众性的行动。公司的中共党委会曾经几次研究了企业的财务成本工作。9月份召开的党的代表会议上，也把节约建筑材料和降低成本列为当前先进生产者运动的主要内容之一。各工地还全面推行了班组经济核算，从公司到工地，都建立了加强成本分析和管理的制度。由于职工们积极提出合理化建议和采用各种新技术，这个工程公司已经节约了大量的钢材、木材和水泥。全公司百分之六十以上的工程技术人员也都提出了合理化建议。仅是工程师唐允文和青年技术员蔡德慧、于中民共同研究提出的修改一座涵洞的设计，就在保证工程质量的前提下，节约了价值四万元的钢筋和水泥。
    各工地已经形成了一种精打细算的节约风气。广大职工经常把废弃在工地上的竹木、铁钉、芦席等，收集起来加以利用。在鼓架山采石场工地上，建筑者们已经利用废弃的木材，加工成一批批工地临时设施工程需用的门窗、屋架等。工地上的架子工们，过去拆脚手架的时候，总是先用刀把绑架子的绳索砍断，现在他们改用解脱绳索的办法拆架子，绳索的利用率就大大提高了。木工们为了不再使铁钉抛撒在工地上，现在拆除混凝土模板的时候，随拆模板，随起钉子。
    建筑者们在选择建筑用材的时候，也很注意就地取材，节省运输费用。他们经过研究，在保证工程质量的前提下，采用了工地采石场剥离下来的碎石和工地附近的黄砂，代替按设计要由外地运来的碎石和黄砂，这样每立方公尺碎石的价格就降低了三分之二，每立方公尺黄砂的价格降低了95％。
