Xinhua News Agency, November 17th, TASS, New York, November 16th: Recently, American newspapers have been increasingly reporting that the largest American oil monopoly organizations are trying their best to use the situation caused by the Anglo-French and Israeli aggression against Egypt to strengthen the economic dependence of Western European countries on them. The American business magazine "Business Week" asserted that the Suez Canal will be closed for a long time, and it wrote, "Britain and France will have to ask the United States for economic assistance."

However, the magazine indicated that oil aid "is conditional, that is, Britain and France must follow American policies."

The newspaper pointed out that the rash aggression against Egypt greatly increased the economic difficulties of the aggressors themselves. As a result of the Anglo-French aggression against Egypt, Western European countries lost 80% of the oil they needed, that is, about 2.1 million barrels per day. Among them, 1.2 million barrels were transported through the Suez Canal, and 525,000 barrels were transported through the oil pipeline that has now been destroyed. Currently, oil can only be transported from Saudi Arabia to Western Europe along the Trans-Arabian pipeline, which can only transport 325,000 barrels a day. However, the Saudi Arabian government has banned the supply of oil to Britain and France.

According to Agence France-Presse, at the same time, the United States intends to "formulate a plan to supply the oil needed by Europe." The report emphasized that this plan will be implemented when Europe's stored oil is exhausted. The report said that Britain's stored oil can only be used for two months, France can use it for three months, and West Germany can only use it for one month.

Newspaper reports indicate that the United States is not in a hurry to supply oil to Europe. A "Chicago Daily News" reporter said that American oil industry bosses "are waiting for oil prices to rise before doing business with British companies."

As a result of the Suez Canal blockade, there are not enough oil tankers, which has also strengthened dependence on the United States. The United States is now rushing to put reserve oil tankers into use. A large-scale plan to build oil tankers is being drafted in the hope that the world market's need for oil tankers will increase. The U.S. Maritime Administration recently announced that it is currently negotiating with private companies to build 31 new oil tankers with a displacement of 100,000 tons.

### 英法侵略埃及引起石油来源枯竭  美国想使西欧国家饮鸩止渴

    英法侵略埃及引起石油来源枯竭
    美国想使西欧国家饮鸩止渴
    新华社17日讯　塔斯社纽约16日讯：最近美国报纸越来越频繁地报道美国最大的石油垄断组织竭力利用英、法和以色列侵略埃及所造成的局势来加强西欧国家对它们的经济依赖。美国商界杂志“商业周刊”断言说，苏伊士运河将要长期停航，它写道，“英法两国将不得不向美国要求经济援助。”
    但是，杂志表明，石油援助“是有条件的，那就是英法两国要遵循美国的政策。”
    报纸指出，冒失地对埃及发动的侵略大大增加了侵略者自身的经济困难。英法侵略埃及的结果使西欧国家失去了80％的他们所需要的石油，即每昼夜失去约二百一十万大桶。其中有一百二十万大桶经过苏伊士运河运输的，还有五十二万五千桶是通过现在已经被破坏的油管运输的。目前石油只能从沙特阿拉伯沿着横贯阿拉伯的油管输送到西欧，这条石油管一天只能输送三十二万五千大桶。可是，沙特阿拉伯政府已经禁止对英法供应石油。
    据法新社消息，同时，美国打算“制定一个供应欧洲所需要的石油的计划。”消息强调说，当欧洲储存的石油耗尽时，将要实现这个计划。消息说，英国储存的石油只能供两个月使用，法国能供三个月使用，西德只能用一个月。
    报纸消息指明，美国并不忙于供应欧洲石油。“芝加哥每日新闻”记者说，美国石油工业老板“在等石油价格上涨后，再同英国公司做生意”。
    由于苏伊士运河封锁的结果，油船不够了，这也加强了对美国的依赖。美国现在正匆匆忙忙地把后备油船调出来使用。正在草拟一个庞大的建造油船的计划，以期世界市场对油船的需要增加。美国航运局不久以前宣布，目前正在同私人公司谈判建造三十一只排水量达十万吨的新油船。
