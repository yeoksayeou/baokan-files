Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 15th: China has trained its first batch of twenty-eight marine surveyors, eight of whom have already taken up marine surveying positions in coastal ports.

    These young marine surveyors were university students and shipyard workers just a year ago. Under the guidance of Soviet experts in Shanghai and Dalian ports, they learned various techniques for inspecting the hull, machinery, and electrical systems of ships.

    The authority of marine surveyors is to represent the state by being stationed in ports to regularly inspect the technical performance of domestic ships and foreign merchant ships that do not meet the technical certificate requirements, determining whether they are suitable to continue sailing, and simultaneously supervise the construction of domestic ships. The training of this batch of marine surveyors is in response to the rapid development of China's foreign trade and domestic shipping industries. In the nearly hundred years before liberation, China's marine surveying rights were controlled by imperialists. At that time, even China's ocean-going ships had to be inspected by foreign marine surveyors and issued technical certificates before they could sail.

    我国有了第一批验船师
    新华社上海15日电　我国已经培养出第一批验船师二十八人，其中八人已经走上沿海港口的验船岗位。
    这批年青的验船师，一年以前还是高等学校的学生和造船厂的工人。他们分别在上海和大连港由苏联专家指导，学会了检验轮船的船体、机器、电气等各种技术。
    验船师的职权是代表国家驻在港口定期检验国内船舶和不符合技术证书规定的外籍商船的技术性能，确定它们是否适宜继续航行，同时监造国内船只。这批验船师是适应我国对外贸易和国内航运事业迅速发展而培养的。在解放前的近百年中，我国验船权是被帝国主义者掌握的，那时连我国的远洋轮船也要由外国验船师检验，发给技术证书，才能航行。
