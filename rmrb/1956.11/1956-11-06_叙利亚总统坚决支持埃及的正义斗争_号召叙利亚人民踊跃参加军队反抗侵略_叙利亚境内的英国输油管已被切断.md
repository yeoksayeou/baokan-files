Xinhua News Agency, November 5th dispatch from Damascus: Syrian President Kuwatli, upon returning to Syria from Moscow on November 4th, delivered a speech supporting Egypt's struggle against foreign aggression and calling on Syrians to join the army to resist aggression.

Kuwatli said to the welcoming crowd at Aleppo Airport, "We are prepared to recruit tens of thousands of volunteers to defend the Arab homeland. Do not think we lack weapons. We have ample weapons, and we will use them to defend our rights."

He said, "The Arab homeland is now in urgent need of a spirit of generous sacrifice, and you will see me standing on the front lines of the battle. I will personally take up arms with you. If necessary, we will fight from house to house, from room to room. And we shall be victorious."

Kuwatli said that his talks with Soviet leaders in Moscow were "very successful."

Xinhua News Agency, November 5th dispatch from Beirut: A representative of the Iraq Petroleum Company in Lebanon said on the evening of November 4th that the oil pipelines laid by his company in Syria had stopped transporting oil, and at least two pumping stations in Syria had been severely damaged.

Reports indicate that this was an act of retaliation by some Arabs against the Anglo-French aggression against Egypt.

The Iraq Petroleum Company is a company dominated by British capital. This company exports approximately 26 million tons of oil annually from Iraqi oil fields to the Mediterranean coast through pipelines laid in Syria. With the Suez Canal traffic disrupted, the Syrian pipeline is even more important for Britain's oil supply.

At the same time, Syrian Prime Minister and Military Governor Asali issued an order on November 4th prohibiting the export of crude oil stored in Syria by the Iraq Petroleum Company outside Syria, in order to maximize the guarantee of crude oil supply for Syrian refineries.

    新华社5日讯　大马士革消息：叙利亚总统库阿特利11月4日从莫斯科回到叙利亚的时候发表讲话，支持埃及反对外国侵略的斗争，并且号召叙利亚人参加军队反抗侵略。
    库阿特利在阿勒颇机场对欢迎他的群众说，“我们准备召募成千成万的志愿人员来保卫阿拉伯人的祖国。不要以为我们缺乏武器。我们有充足的武器，我们将用它们来保卫我们的权利。”
    他说，“阿拉伯人的祖国现在急需慷慨牺牲的精神，你们将看到我站在战斗的前线。我将亲自同你们一起拿起武器。必要的时候，我们将从一家到一家，从一间房子到一间房子进行战斗。并且我们将要胜利。”
    库阿特利说，他在莫斯科同苏联领袖的会谈“甚为成功”。
    新华社5日讯　贝鲁特消息：伊拉克石油公司驻黎巴嫩的一个代表11月4日晚说，他的公司敷设在叙利亚境内的油管已经停止输送石油，在叙利亚境内的抽油站至少有两个已经遭到严重破坏。
    有消息说，这是一些阿拉伯人采取的报复英法侵略埃及的行动。
    伊拉克石油公司是英国资本占统治地位的一个公司，这家公司每年通过敷设在叙利亚的油管从伊拉克的油田输出约二千六百万吨石油到地中海沿岸。随着苏伊士运河的交通中断，叙利亚油管对英国的石油供应更为重要。
    同时，叙利亚总理兼军事总督阿萨利11月4日颁布了命令禁止把存贮在叙利亚境内的伊拉克石油公司的原油运出叙利亚境外，以便尽量保证叙利亚炼油厂的原油供应。
