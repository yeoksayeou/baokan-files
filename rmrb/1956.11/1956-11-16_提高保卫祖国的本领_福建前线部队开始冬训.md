    Improve the Ability to Defend the Motherland
    Fujian Frontline Troops Begin Winter Training
    Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Frontline, November 14th. The Chinese People's Liberation Army units on the Fujian Front have entered winter training. Now, in the fields, mountains, and sea areas along the Fujian coast, officers and soldiers can be seen vigorously practicing the skills to defend the motherland everywhere.
    The air defense forces, artillery, and coastal sentries guarding the forward positions have put forward the slogan "Fight when the enemy comes, train when they leave," setting off a training upsurge. New recruits who enlisted this year, with the help of officers and veteran soldiers, have been able to use their weapons more skillfully and perform combat duties after summer training. Now they are running and jumping through the mountains with the veteran soldiers all day long.
    Many soldiers have written their arduous but happy training life into clappers and ditties. Soldier Wang Fengbin of a certain unit wrote: "Taking big strides forward, unknowingly crossing two mountains; the motherland's high mountains and seas are defended by us, my happiness is indescribable!"
    In order to carry out the mobilization work for winter training, each unit held a representative meeting of advanced elements at the beginning of the training, commending and rewarding advanced units and individuals who achieved outstanding results in summer training. "Jinan Company", "Beijing-Shanghai Combat Model Squad" and other units of a certain unit also won the winning flag in the winter training demonstration exercise.

    提高保卫祖国的本领
    福建前线部队开始冬训
    新华社福建前线14日电　福建前线的中国人民解放军各部队进入冬季训练。现在，在福建沿海地区的田野里，高山上和海面上，到处可以看到军官和士兵生龙活虎地操练保卫祖国的本领。
    守卫在前沿阵地上的防空军、炮兵和海岸哨兵，提出了“敌人来了就打，走了就练”的口号，掀起了练兵热潮。今年入伍的新战士在军官和老战士的帮助下，经过夏季训练，已经能够比较熟练地使用手中武器和执行战斗勤务。现在他们和老战士一起整天在崇山峻岭间奔跑跳跃。
    许多战士把他们这种艰苦而愉快的练兵生活写成快板、小调。某部士兵王峰斌写道：“迈开大步往前冲，不觉冲过了两重山；祖国的高山大海由我们来保卫，我的高兴说也说不出来！”
    各部队为了进行冬季训练的动员工作，都在训练开始时分别举行了先进分子代表会议，表扬和奖励在夏季训练中取得优异成绩的先进单位和先进人物。某部“济南连”、“京沪战斗模范班”等单位在冬季训练示范演习中，还获得优胜奖旗。
