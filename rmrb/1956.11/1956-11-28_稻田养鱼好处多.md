Raising Fish in Rice Paddies Has Many Benefits
Feng Lejin

Raising fish in rice paddies has a long history in China, with written records dating back to the Song Dynasty. Farmers in Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, Guangxi, Guangdong, Hunan, Fujian, Zhejiang, and other provinces have traditionally raised fish in rice paddies.

Raising fish in rice paddies is an extremely beneficial undertaking, yielding both rice and fish from the same piece of land. According to investigations by the Ministry of Aquatic Products in Hechuan, Bishan, and Tongliang in Sichuan, and Quan County in Guangxi, the area of rice paddies used for fish farming in these regions accounts for approximately 30%-60% of the total rice paddy area. The main fish raised are carp, followed by crucian carp. In Sichuan, most fish eggs are collected from the Yangtze River, with a small portion supplied by state-owned fish hatcheries. In Guangxi, incubation takes place within the rice paddies. Sichuan's rice paddies, due to their deeper water levels, have higher yields, generally producing 35 jin of fish per mu of rice paddy, with a maximum of over 100 jin. Guangxi, due to shallower water levels and the degradation of carp breeds, generally yields 20 jin, with a maximum of 50 jin. The masses in these areas have rich experience in fish farming.

Is raising fish in rice paddies harmful to the growth of rice? According to our research with experts from various fields, the unanimous opinion is that it is entirely beneficial and without harm, or at the very least, more beneficial than harmful. The so-called "minor harm" is merely a temporary phenomenon in the process of developing rice paddy fish farming, and it can be resolved.

According to surveys, grain production generally increases in areas where fish are raised in rice paddies. Why is this the case? Because raising fish in rice paddies requires maintaining a certain water level (generally 3 to 6 cun), which increases drought resistance. Carp are omnivorous fish, and rice paddy pests such as rice stem borers and leaf beetles that feed exclusively on rice roots are their prey. Carp and crucian carp frequently move among the rice plants, eating weeds as they appear, inhibiting growth, reducing fertilizer consumption by weeds, and shortening weeding time. The constant movement of fish increases the dissolved oxygen content in the water, promoting fertilizer decomposition and altering the soil. Fish activity loosens the soil, causing the rice plants to grow sparsely and vigorously. Fish excrement can also be used as fertilizer, and the water temperature in the field is appropriately adjusted by the movement of the fish.

From an economic standpoint, in addition to increasing rice yields, fish are also a source of income for farmers. Assuming that each mu can produce 20 jin of fish, this is equivalent to an additional 200 jin of rice.

As for the specific benefits of raising fish in rice paddies for rice crops:

Some believe that fish eat rice roots, affecting rice growth. In fact, fish do not eat rice roots unless, under special circumstances, the density of fish is too high, and the feed becomes a serious problem, in which case eating rice roots or cannibalism is possible. Therefore, as long as attention is paid to appropriate stocking densities, this problem will not occur.

Some also believe that the water level is deepened due to raising fish in rice paddies, and when the fish grow larger, the rice plants are prone to lodging. We believe that as long as attention is paid to planting the rice seedlings deep and firmly during transplanting, and the fish are released into the field one week or ten days after transplanting, the problem can be solved. If you select varieties with strong rice stalks, there will be no problem at all. At the same time, there are many reasons for rice lodging, and many rice paddies that do not raise fish also experience lodging.

Still others believe that chemical fertilizers need to be applied to rice paddies, and the water needs to be drained before the rice flowers and grains are formed, making it inconvenient to raise fish in rice paddies. In fact, as long as the rice paddy is equipped with "fish pits" or ditches, the fish can temporarily retreat when chemical fertilizers are applied or the water in the field is shallow. When the rice is harvested, the fish pits can also be used to collect the fish for easy harvesting.

Raising fish in rice paddies has not yet been widely promoted in China. The reason is that there is insufficient awareness of the benefits of raising fish in rice paddies in various regions, and there is still some emphasis on agriculture and neglect of fishing. We believe that in the future, fish should be raised in all rice paddies where it is possible. It is said that there are more than 400 million mu of rice paddies nationwide. If fish are raised on 300 million mu, and each mu yields 20 jin, then the annual production can reach 6 billion jin, or 3 million tons. This figure exceeds the current total output of aquatic products in the country, which is of great significance in solving the supply of meat for the people of the whole country. I believe that if all regions attach importance to the cause of raising fish in rice paddies, and mobilize all forces that should be mobilized to solve some of the temporary problems in the current work, raising fish in rice paddies will increasingly play a significant role in accumulating social wealth and improving people's lives.

    稻田养鱼好处多
    冯乐进
    稻田养鱼在我国有着悠久的历史，宋代就有了文字记载。川、滇、黔、桂、粤、湘、闽、浙等省，农民历来都有稻田养鱼的习惯。
    稻田养鱼是极有利的事业，在同一块土地上，既收稻谷又收鱼。据水产部在四川合川、璧山、铜梁及广西全县等地的考察，这些地区稻田养鱼面积约占水稻田的30％—60％。主要是养鲤鱼，其次是鲫鱼。四川养鱼大部分到长江去捞鱼卵，少部分由国营鱼种场供应。广西则在稻田内进行孵化。四川稻田因水位较深，其产量较高，一般为每亩稻田产鱼三十五斤，最多可达一百多斤。广西因水位较浅，且鲤鱼品种退化，产量一般二十斤，最多的五十斤。这些地区群众均有丰富的养鱼经验。
    稻田养鱼对稻子的生长有无害处？据我们与各方面专家研究，一致的意见是百利而无一害，或者最少说是利多害少。这种所谓“害少”也不过是在发展稻田养鱼过程中的暂时现象，而且是可以解决的。
    据调查，稻田养鱼地区一般都可以增产粮食。这是什么原因呢？因为稻田养鱼后要保持稻田一定的水位（一般要三寸到六寸），这样能增加抗旱的能力；鲤鱼为杂食性鱼类，稻田内害虫二化螟及专食稻根的金花虫等均为其摄食对象；鲤鱼、鲫鱼等经常活动于稻禾间，杂草为其随时吃掉，不易生长，减少了杂草所消耗的肥料，同时可减少锄草时间；由于鱼经常活动，增加了水中的溶解氧含量，能促进肥料的分解，改变土壤；鱼活动使泥土变松，稻禾株与株之间分散生长茂盛；鱼的粪便也可作肥料，田间的水温亦因鱼的游动而得到适当的调剂。
    从经济价值上讲，稻田养鱼除增加稻谷产量外，鱼亦是农民收入之一。假定每亩能产鱼二十斤，即等于多增产二百斤稻谷。
    至于稻田养鱼对稻禾究竟有那些利益？
    有人认为鱼吃稻根而影响稻禾生长。事实上鱼是不吃稻根的，除非在特殊情况下，养的鱼密度太大，其饵料成为严重问题时，吃稻根或自相残食是有可能的。因此只要注意放养密度适当，则不致发生问题。
    也有人认为稻田因养鱼而水位加深，加以当鱼生长较大时，稻禾易引起倒伏。我们认为只要在插秧时，注意将秧根插得深固些，待插秧后一周或十天后，放鱼入田，问题就可以解决。如果选择稻茎坚硬的品种则更无问题。同时，稻禾倒伏原因甚多，有不少稻田根本未养鱼，也有倒伏的。
    又有人认为稻田需要施用化学肥料，在稻禾开花结穗前，又需要落水干田，因此，稻田不便养鱼。事实上，只要稻田内设有“鱼溜”或水沟，在施用化肥或田中水浅时，鱼自可前趋暂避；稻禾收割时，鱼溜也可用来集鱼，便于捕捞。
    稻田养鱼在我国还未能大量推广，其原因是各地对稻田养鱼的好处认识不足，同时还多少存在重农轻渔的思想。我们认为，今后凡稻田能养鱼的尽量放养。据说全国稻田有四亿多亩，按三亿亩养上鱼，每亩按二十斤产量计算，全年可产鱼六十亿斤，也就是三百万吨。这个数字超过目前全国水产品的总产量，这对于解决全国人民肉食的供应上有着很大的意义。我相信，如果各地重视稻田养鱼事业，并动员一切应动员的力量来解决目前工作中暂存的一些问题，稻田养鱼在积累社会财富、提高人民生活上将会日益发挥其显著的作用。
