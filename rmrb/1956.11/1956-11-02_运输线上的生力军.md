    This Dispatch:
    Our newspaper reports that the Wuhan Municipal Transportation Administration is actively organizing non-professional freight trucks to participate in city transportation. To date, 132 non-professional freight trucks have assisted relevant transportation departments in transporting 63,374 tons of materials, alleviating some of the pressure on city transportation. The city will begin on a large scale in November to organize non-professional transportation tools to participate in city transportation to meet the needs of the increasing transportation tasks.
    The potential power of freight trucks owned by various agencies and enterprises in Wuhan is very large. 135 units in the city have 859 cars, with a total deadweight of 3,325 tons, which is about twice the capacity of professional transportation units. The utilization rate of these vehicles is mostly low. As long as unified planning and management are strengthened, they can all participate in city transportation and assist professional transportation units in jointly completing the country's transportation tasks. For example, the two self-owned trucks of the Provincial Petroleum Company, after being organized and utilized, participated in city transportation for 48 working vehicle days in August and September in addition to completing their own business, completing transportation tasks of 917 tons. In the past, the repair costs of these two cars were not enough to cover the depreciation costs, but now, with operating income from participating in city transportation, it is very beneficial for vehicle maintenance.

    运输线上的生力军
    本报讯　武汉市交通运输管理局积极组织非专业货运汽车参加市内运输，到目前为止，已有一百三十二辆非专业货运汽车帮助有关运输部门运送了六万三千三百七十四吨物资，减轻了市内运输一部分紧张压力。全市将从11月份起，大规模组织非专业运输工具参加市内运输，以适应日益增长的运输任务的需要。
    武汉市各机关企业等单位自备的货运汽车潜在力量很大。全市一百三十五个单位就有八百五十九辆汽车，总载重量达三千三百二十五吨，比专业运输单位的运力要大一倍左右。这些车辆的利用率绝大部分都不高，只要加强统一的计划管理，都可以参加市内运输，协助专业运输单位共同完成国家的运输任务。如省石油公司的自备货车二辆，被组织利用后，8、9两个月除完成本身业务外，参加市内运输达四十八个工作车日，完成运输任务达九百一十七吨；以往这二部车子的修理费用凭折旧费不够开支，现在参加市内运输有了营运收入，对车辆的保修很有利。
