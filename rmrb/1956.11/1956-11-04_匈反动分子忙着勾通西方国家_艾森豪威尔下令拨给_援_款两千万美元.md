Xinhua News Agency, Prague, November 3rd: Hungarian reactionaries, who have resurfaced amidst the armed riots, are urgently seeking contact with Western countries.

Cardinal Mindszenty, who was sentenced to life imprisonment by the people's democratic government for treason and released by Hungarian rioters a few days ago, told the American United Press International reporter on November 2nd that he asked the West, especially the Western powers, to "support us and help us when the situation is so serious." Leaflets have been found distributed in Budapest, demanding that Mindszenty join the Nagy government. There are also reports that the Papal Nuncio of Pope Pius XII is traveling to Hungary to meet with Mindszenty.

A few days ago, the commander of the rebel armed forces, and now the Deputy Minister of National Defense of the Nagy government, Maleter, also told the United Press International reporter on November 2nd that he requested the West to "provide material and moral assistance." He asked this reporter to pass his request on to Western countries.

On the same day, US President Eisenhower issued a statement in Washington saying that he had ordered "an initial allocation of $20 million from funds appropriated by Congress for emergency use" as "aid" to Hungary. In the statement, Eisenhower also expressed "respect" for the so-called "courage and sacrifice" of the Hungarian counter-revolutionaries in recent days.

The new US Envoy to Hungary is rushing from Washington to Budapest, and he arrived in Vienna on the 2nd.

According to a Reuters report on October 30th, reliable sources say that two "emissaries" of the Hungarian rioters passed through Zurich, Switzerland, on October 29th from Budapest, heading to London to contact the British Foreign Office.

The Social Democratic Party, established in Budapest on October 30th, sent their representative, Anna Kethly, to Vienna on the same day to negotiate with Western political figures.
