    Soviet Foreign Aid
    Cheng Guangrui
    The Soviet Union has always pursued a policy of peaceful coexistence and friendly cooperation with all countries. Based on this policy, the Soviet Union has established economic cooperation relations with other socialist countries and many economically underdeveloped countries on the principle of equality and mutual benefit, and has provided these countries with sincere assistance.
    The Soviet Union's sincere assistance is primarily reflected in the mutual assistance and cooperation between socialist countries.
    During World War II, the Soviet people assisted the people of some European and Asian countries in liberating themselves from the rule of fascist aggressors, enabling these countries to embark on the path of people's democracy and independent development. In the difficult early days of liberation for the people's democratic countries, the Soviet people supplied these countries with large quantities of food, fuel, machinery and equipment, and important raw materials to help them heal the wounds of war, restore the national economy, and stabilize social life. The threat of famine in Poland was alleviated because the Soviet Union shipped grain to Poland in 1946. The Czechoslovak people were able to overcome the most difficult harvest failure of 1947 because the Soviet Union supplied 600,000 tons of grain. Romania's oil industry was able to begin production because the Soviet Union supplied machinery and equipment. Bulgaria's textile industry was able to start up quickly because it received 11,000 tons of cotton from the Soviet Union. Soviet loans, machinery, equipment, and the help of experts played an important role in the rapid recovery of our national economy.
    After the people's democratic countries restored their national economies, they began the great historical task of building socialism and received comprehensive assistance from the Soviet Union. Relying on its strong and developed socialist economy and advanced construction experience, the Soviet Union provided all-round assistance to the people's democratic countries through loans, trade, supply of equipment, dispatch of experts, scientific and technological cooperation, and other means.
    The central task of socialist construction is to realize industrialization. However, the original industries of the people's democratic countries were difficult to adapt to the requirements of socialist industrialization. New industrial sectors had to be established, and the old industrial sectors had to be transformed and expanded with the latest technology. This required a large number of modern machinery and equipment and various raw materials needed to develop these industries. The Soviet Union largely met the needs of the people's democratic countries in this regard. Through trade, the Soviet Union supplied the people's democratic countries with the most advanced equipment needed by the metallurgical industry, machinery manufacturing industry, mining industry, chemical industry, textile industry, food industry, and other industrial sectors, as well as tractors, agricultural machinery, railway equipment, fertilizers, mineral sands, ferrous and non-ferrous metals, textile raw materials, and other items. The most important types of machinery needed by the major industrial sectors of the people's democratic countries, as well as raw materials such as iron ore, chromite ore, manganese ore, and cotton, and many other items, were largely met by imports from the Soviet Union to meet their rapidly growing needs.
    At present, the Soviet Union is helping the people's democratic countries build 446 industrial enterprises and 96 separate workshops, including 211 enterprises and 21 separate workshops in our country. After these enterprises are completed, the people's democratic countries will be able to increase their annual production by 5.4 million kilowatts of electricity, 9 million tons of steel, 4 million tons of petroleum products, 140,000 automobiles, and 50,000 tractors, as well as other important industrial products. The Soviet Union has provided the people's democratic countries with long-term loans totaling 21 billion rubles on the most favorable terms, including long-term loans of 300 million U.S. dollars and 520 million rubles to our country. In addition, the Soviet Union has also provided the people's democratic countries with various technical materials and dispatched a large number of experts to help these countries carry out socialist construction.
    The Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam suffered serious losses in the war and encountered major difficulties in restoring and developing their national economies. The Soviet government gratuitously allocated 1 billion rubles to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and 400 million rubles to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to help them restore and develop their national economies.
    Soviet assistance is one of the important conditions for the rapid growth of industrial production in the people's democratic countries. In 1955, China's industrial output had more than doubled its pre-war peak and more than quadrupled its 1949 level, Poland had increased to more than four times its pre-war level, Bulgaria had increased to more than five times, Czechoslovakia had increased to more than twice, Hungary had increased to three and a half times, Romania had increased to nearly three times, Albania had increased to more than eleven times, and the German Democratic Republic had increased to more than twice. The rate of industrial production growth in the people's democratic countries far exceeded that of capitalist countries.
    In establishing economic cooperation relations with economically underdeveloped countries, the Soviet Union has also provided these countries with sincere assistance. Soviet assistance provides these countries with favorable conditions for developing their national industries and striving for economic independence.
    At present, the Soviet Union is helping India build a steel plant with an annual output of 1.3 million tons of steel and will supply India with 1 million tons of steel in the next three years. The Soviet Union has dispatched 300 experts to India to work. The Soviet Union has gratuitously donated a senior industrial technology institute to India and a batch of tractors and other agricultural machinery that can operate a mechanized farm covering an area of 30,000 acres. Recently, the Soviet Union proposed to grant India a loan of 600 million rupees to purchase industrial equipment. During India's Second Five-Year Plan, the total amount of loans granted to India by the Soviet Union will reach 1.8 billion rupees. The Soviet Union has previously helped Afghanistan build cotton mills, oil depots, granaries, flour mills, and bakeries, and last year granted Afghanistan a loan of 100 million U.S. dollars. In order to help Burma solve the difficulties in rice sales, the Soviet Union will import 400,000 tons of rice from Burma annually for the next four years, and the Soviet Union will provide Burma with machinery, equipment, technology, and other assistance. Last year, the Soviet Union also donated an arts and crafts college to Burma to train technical personnel for Burma. This year, the Soviet Union also signed an agreement with Indonesia to provide technical and economic assistance to Indonesia, granting Indonesia a loan of 100 million U.S. dollars. In addition, in the past two years, the Soviet Union has also signed important economic agreements with Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, Yemen, Pakistan, and other countries. The Soviet Union is willing to extend a helping hand to all countries striving for national independence and economic independence.
    Today, the Soviet Union is ahead of the world in the peaceful use of atomic energy, but the Soviet Union does not intend to monopolize this most important achievement of human science. The Soviet Union advocates the establishment of international cooperation and is willing to conduct research jointly with nuclear physicists from all countries. In 1955, the Soviet Union decided to provide some people's democratic countries with scientific and technological and production assistance in establishing scientific experimental stations for nuclear physics research and peaceful use of atomic energy. At present, these countries are building atomic reactors with the help of the Soviet Union. This year, the Joint Nuclear Research Institute was established in Moscow with the participation of the Soviet Union and eleven other socialist countries. The Soviet Union transferred assets worth more than 500 million rubles, including huge synchrocyclotrons and laboratory equipment, to the Joint Nuclear Research Institute for use. In addition, the Soviet Union has also signed an agreement with Egypt to cooperate in nuclear physics research and the peaceful use of atomic energy; decided to help Indonesia train technical personnel in the application of atomic energy and radioactive materials in medicine; and intends to introduce the experience of peaceful use of atomic energy to India and other countries. The Soviet Union's assistance to other socialist countries and economically underdeveloped countries in the peaceful use of atomic energy is not only of great significance for promoting the technological progress and productivity development of these countries, but also a huge contribution to the cause of human science and progress.
    The purpose of Soviet foreign aid is to promote the economic upsurge of the people's democratic countries and to help economically underdeveloped countries develop their own industries and strive for economic independence. The Soviet Union takes care of the difficulties of these countries everywhere. The interest rate on Soviet foreign loans is very low. In order to take care of the foreign exchange and financial situation of economically underdeveloped countries, the Soviet Union agrees that these countries can use their traditional export commodities to repay the commodities imported from the Soviet Union when trading with the Soviet Union, and can use their own currencies for payment and settlement. For example, Burma can use its difficult-to-sell rice to exchange for Soviet machinery, and India can use its own rupees to repay Soviet loans. The Soviet Union has always provided these countries with commodities that help their economic development. The steel plant that the Soviet Union is helping India build will be wholly owned by India. The Soviet Union does not require investment, profit sharing, or management of the factory. The Soviet Union never intends to gain economic control over these countries. On the contrary, it wants to help these countries achieve economic independence. Therefore, the Soviet Union is not afraid to engage in peaceful competition with capitalist countries on the issue of assisting the industrialization of economically underdeveloped countries.
    Soviet foreign aid is fundamentally different from American "aid." It does not take advantage of others' misfortunes, but rather helps them out of their difficulties. When the United States recently stopped supplying Egypt with grain in order to force Egypt to accept "international control" over the Suez Canal, the Soviet Union decided to supply Egypt with 200,000 tons of wheat to meet the Egyptian people's need for food. When Poland is currently in economic difficulty, the Soviet Union, according to the Soviet-Polish negotiations, provides Poland with 1.4 million tons of grain and 700 million rubles of loans, giving Poland genuine fraternal help. When Hungary faced the serious danger of counter-revolutionary restoration, the Soviet army, accepting the request of the Hungarian Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government, assisted the Hungarian people in crushing the counter-revolutionary forces' restoration plot, defending the people's democratic system, and responding to the call of the Hungarian Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government together with other socialist countries, transporting a large amount of aid materials to the Hungarian people.
    The sincere and selfless nature of Soviet foreign aid is determined by the nature of socialist countries. There is no economic crisis or market problem in the Soviet Union. In the Soviet Union, there are no social groups and classes who want to seize foreign territory and launch aggressive wars. The working people live by their own labor, not by exploiting the labor of others. The basic task of socialist countries is to raise the living standards of their own people and develop social productive forces that are free from the shackles of capitalist production relations. This can only be achieved under conditions of peaceful development. The Soviet Union's foreign policy is subordinate to its domestic policy of peaceful development, and its main task is to ensure that the Soviet Union has a long-term peaceful international environment in order to carry out communist construction smoothly. The Soviet Union's helping other countries develop a peaceful economy and improve people's living standards will inevitably strengthen the forces of peace. This is in the interests of the Soviet people. Facts have proven that the Soviet Union's sincere foreign aid has promoted the economic upsurge of the people's democratic countries, helped the economic development of economically underdeveloped countries, and made a significant contribution to the cause of socialism and world peace.

    苏联的对外援助
    程光锐
    苏联一向实行同一切国家和平共处和友好合作的政策。根据这个政策，在平等互利的原则下，苏联同其他社会主义国家和许多经济不发达国家建立了经济合作关系，并给予这些国家以真诚的援助。
    苏联的这种真诚援助首先体现在社会主义各国互助合作的关系中。
    在第二次世界大战期间，苏联人民援助了欧洲和亚洲一些国家的人民从法西斯侵略者的统治下解放出来，使这些国家走上人民民主和独立发展的道路。在各人民民主国家解放初期十分困难的日子里，苏联人民以大量的食物、燃料、机器设备和重要的原料供给这些国家，帮助它们医治战争的创伤，恢复国民经济，安定社会生活。由于苏联1946年把谷物运入波兰，才减轻了波兰国内饥荒的威胁。由于苏联供应了六十万吨粮食，才使捷克斯洛伐克人民渡过了最感困难的歉收的1947年。由于苏联运来了机器设备，罗马尼亚的石油工业才能够开始生产。由于从苏联得到了一万一千吨棉花，保加利亚的纺织工业才能够迅速开工。苏联的贷款、机器设备和专家的帮助，对于我国国民经济的迅速恢复起了重要的作用。
    各人民民主国家在国民经济恢复以后，着手实现建设社会主义的伟大历史任务的时候，更得到苏联全面的援助。苏联依靠它的强大发展的社会主义经济和先进的建设经验，通过贷款、贸易、供应设备、派遣专家、科学技术合作等等方式给予各人民民主国家以各方面的帮助。
  社会主义建设的中心任务是实现工业化。而各人民民主国家原有的工业是很难　　适应社会主义工业化的要求的，必须建立起新的工业部门，并且以最新的技术来改造和扩大旧有的工业部门。因此就需要大量的现代化的机器设备和发展这些工业所需的各种原料。而苏联在很大程度上满足了各人民民主国家在这方面的需要。苏联通过贸易方式，供应人民民主国家以冶金工业、机器制造业、采矿业、化学工业、纺织工业、食品工业和其他工业部门所需要的各种最完善的设备，以及拖拉机、农业机器、铁路设备、肥料、矿砂、黑色和有色金属、纺织原料和其他物品。各人民民主国家主要工业部门所需要的最重要种类的机器，以及像铁矿砂、铬矿砂、锰矿砂，棉花之类的原料和其他许多物品，很大部分是靠从苏联输入来满足自己迅速增长的需要的。
    目前苏联正帮助各人民民主国家建设四百四十六项工业企业和九十六个单独车间，其中包括在我国的二百一十一项企业和二十一个单独车间。这些企业建成后，各人民民主国家每年将能增产五百四十万瓩电力，九百万吨钢，四百万吨石油产品，十四万辆汽车和五万台拖拉机以及其他重要的工业产品。苏联以最优惠的条件向各人民民主国家提供了二百一十亿卢布的长期贷款，其中包括向我国提供的三亿美元和五亿二千万卢布的长期贷款。此外，苏联还向各人民民主国家提供了各种技术资料，派遣了大批专家，帮助这些国家进行社会主义建设。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和越南民主共和国在战争中损失严重，在恢复和发展国民经济工作中遇到重大的困难，苏联政府无偿地分别拨给朝鲜民主主义人民共和国十亿卢布、越南民主共和国四亿卢布，援助他们恢复和发展国民经济。
    苏联的援助是各人民民主国家工业生产迅速增长的重要条件之一。1955年，中国的工业产量已增加到战前最高数字的两倍以上、达到1949年水平的四倍以上，波兰增加到战前水平的四倍以上，保加利亚增加到五倍以上，捷克斯洛伐克增加到两倍以上，匈牙利增加到三倍半，罗马尼亚增加到将近三倍，阿尔巴尼亚增加到十一倍以上，德意志民主共和国增加到两倍以上。各人民民主国家工业生产增长的速度大大超过了资本主义国家。
    苏联在同经济不发达国家建立的经济合作关系中，也对这些国家给予了真诚的援助。苏联的援助为这些国家在发展民族工业、争取经济独立方面提供了有利的条件。
    目前苏联正在帮助印度建设一座年产一百三十万吨钢材的炼钢厂，并且将在最近三年内供应印度一百万吨钢材。苏联已经派遣了三百名专家到印度去工作。苏联无偿地赠送给印度一所高级工业技术学院，并且赠给印度可办一个面积达三万英亩的机械化农场的一批拖拉机和其他农业机器。最近，苏联又建议给予印度六亿卢比的贷款，以便购买工业设备。在印度第二个五年计划期间，苏联给予印度贷款的总数共达十八亿卢比。苏联过去已经帮助阿富汗建设了轧棉厂、石油库、谷仓、面粉厂和面包厂等，去年又给予阿富汗一亿美元的贷款。为了帮助缅甸解决大米销售的困难，苏联将在今后四年内每年从缅甸输入四十万吨大米，同时苏联将向缅甸提供机器装备、技术和其他援助。去年苏联还赠送给缅甸一所工艺学院，为缅甸培养技术人材。今年苏联又同印度尼西亚签订了 给予印度尼西亚技术援助和经济援助的协定，给予印度尼西亚一亿美元的贷款。此外，在过去两年中，苏联还同埃及、叙利亚、黎巴嫩、也门、巴基斯坦等国签订了重要的经济协定，苏联愿意向一切争取民族独立和经济独立的国家伸出援助之手。
    今天，苏联在和平利用原子能方面已经走在全世界的前头，可是苏联并没有打算垄断这个人类科学上的最重要的成果。苏联主张建立国际合作，愿意同一切国家的核子物理学家们共同进行研究。1955年，苏联决定在建立核子物理研究与和平利用原子能的科学实验站工作中，给予一些人民民主国家以科学技术方面和生产方面的援助。目前，这些国家正在苏联帮助下建立原子反应堆。今年莫斯科又成立了有苏联和其他十一个社会主义国家参加的联合核子研究所。苏联并且将价值五亿多卢布的资财，其中包括巨大的同步回旋加速器和实验室等设备一律移交联合核子研究所使用。此外，苏联还同埃及签订协定，将在核子物理研究与和平利用原子能方面进行合作；决定帮助印度尼西亚在原子能和放射性物质在医学上应用方面训练技术人员；并且打算把和平利用原子能方面的经验介绍给印度以及其他国家。苏联在和平利用原子能方面给予其他社会主义国家和经济不发达国家的援助，不仅对于促进这些国家的技术进步和生产力发展有着重大的意义，而且是对人类科学和进步事业的巨大贡献。
    苏联的对外援助的目的在于促进各人民民主国家的经济高涨，帮助经济不发达国家发展本国的工业，争取经济独立。苏联处处照顾这些国家的困难。苏联对外贷款的利息很低。为了照顾经济不发达国家的外汇和财政情况，苏联同意这些国家在同苏联进行贸易时，可以用它们传统输出的商品来偿付从苏联输入的商品，并且可以用它们本国的货币进行支付和清算。例如，缅甸可以用它销售困难的大米来换取苏联的机器，印度可以用自己的卢比来偿付苏联的贷款。苏联一向是对这些国家提供有助于它们的经济发展的商品。苏联帮助印度建立的炼钢厂将完全属于印度自己，苏联既不要求投资，分红，也不要求管理工厂。苏联从来也不打算取得对这些国家经济上的控制，恰恰相反，而是要帮助这些国家取得经济上的独立。因此，在援助经济不发达国家工业化的问题上，苏联是不怕同资本主义国家进行和平竞赛的。
    苏联的对外援助同美国的“援助”有本质上的不同，它不是乘人之危，而是解人之难。当不久前美国为了要压迫埃及接受对苏伊士运河实行“国际管制”而停止供应埃及粮食的时候，苏联却决定供应埃及二十万吨小麦，以满足埃及人民对粮食的需要。当目前波兰处在经济困难情况下的时候，苏联根据苏波谈判向波兰提供一百四十万吨谷物和七亿卢布的贷款，给予波兰以真正的兄弟般的帮助。在匈牙利面临反革命复辟的严重危险的时候，苏联军队接受匈牙利工农革命政府的请求，协助匈牙利人民粉碎了反革命势力的复辟阴谋，保卫了人民民主制度，并且同其他社会主义国家一起响应匈牙利工农革命政府的呼吁，把大批援助的物资源源运给匈牙利人民。
    苏联对外援助的真诚无私的性质是由社会主义国家的本质决定的。在苏联没有经济危机，也没有市场问题。在苏联没有要想侵占外国领土和发动侵略战争的社会集团和阶级，劳动人民是靠自己的劳动，而不是靠剥削他人的劳动来生活的。社会主义国家的基本任务是提高本国人民的生活水平，发展摆脱了资本主义生产关系的束缚的社会生产力。这只有在和平发展的条件下才可能达到。苏联的对外政策是服从于国内和平发展的政策的，它的主要任务就是要保证苏联有一个长期和平的国际环境，以便顺利地进行共产主义建设。苏联帮助其他国家发展和平经济，提高人民生活水平，也就必然会加强和平的力量。这是符合苏联人民的利益的。事实证明，苏联的对外的真诚援助，已经促进了各人民民主国家的经济高涨，帮助了经济不发达国家经济的发展，对社会主义事业和世界和平事业作出了重大的贡献。
