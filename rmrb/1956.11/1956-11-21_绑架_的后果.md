    The Consequences of "Kidnapping"
    Cheng Bei
    The bandit behavior of the French colonialists is despicable. After five national leaders of the Algerian National Liberation Front were deceitfully kidnapped to Paris by the French authorities in Algeria at the end of October, the so-called "French Military Tribunal" tried them for the so-called "depressing morale and corrupting the hearts of the people," and they may be sentenced to death, which has aroused the anger of people all over the world.
    The French colonialists' "kidnapping" originally had a teacher to follow. At the beginning of the last century, Napoleon used similar "achievements" to deal with "slaves" in the West Indies. And this matter became "the most unlawful and unjust thing in the entire history of the Americas."
    In 1801, Napoleon attempted to use Haiti in the West Indies as an important base for his "French Empire Plan" in the Americas, and sent General Leclerc with 54 warships and 29,000 elite soldiers to attack Haiti. After a period of invasion, the French "elite soldiers" suffered heavy losses. General Leclerc's bitter complaint to Napoleon was just like the miserable situation suffered by the French colonialists in Africa today. He said:
      “To give you an idea of the losses of our army, you know that the Seventh Unit, when it first arrived here, was made up of 1,395 strong men; now only 86 half-sick men remain in the army, 107 are in the hospital, and the rest are dead.
      “The Eleventh Light Infantry Regiment had 1,900 strong men when it landed here, now only 163 men can still serve, and 200 are in the hospital.
    “The Seventy-first Unit originally had 1,000 strong men, now only seventeen men are in the army, and one hundred and seven are in the hospital...
    “Thus, please imagine my situation in this country, where civil war has been going on for ten years, and those rebels are determined that we are going to enslave them...”
    Only a century and a half ago, the people were fighting the shameful colonialists so heroically. Before Leclerc died of "yellow fever" in Haiti, he pretended to be "peaceful" and invited the leader of the "rebels," Toussaint, an outstanding figure produced by the revolutionary movement throughout the Americas, to meet with him. After his arrival, he committed this "most unlawful and unjust act in the entire history of the Americas," arresting Toussaint, putting him in shackles, shipping him to France, and arbitrarily sentencing him. This Haitian people's hero, Toussaint, died in a French prison in 1803.
    The ending of this "unlawful and unjust" action was this: it was Napoleon himself who was frightened by the French massacre. In addition to Leclerc's death from yellow fever, in October of the same year, the French army surrendered to the people. Later, Napoleon increased his troops by 43,000 to reinforce them, and another 35,000 died. When the defeated fleet was transporting 8,000 old, weak, and disabled soldiers back to their country, it was captured and enslaved by his unjust old friend, the British fleet. The French "elite soldiers" were completely wiped out.
    In that century, this kind of story was not just this one. In 1832, when the American army massacred the Seminole Indians in Florida, seven generals were defeated in seven years. An American future president, General Taylor, and General Jackson at the time, "encouraged the great Seminole leader Osceola to attend a peace conference under the guarantee of safety. But after Osceola arrived, he was immediately struck on the head, tied up, and locked in a dungeon... Do not forget that all of this was done by the American army on the orders of the American president." Although the great Seminole leader Osceola died in prison less than a year after the "kidnapping," the Seminole people still live on the land of Florida to this day. At that time, in the struggle of the Indians against American "territorial expansion," it was the same everywhere. One Osceola died, and more Osceolas grew up.
    Today, the French colonialists want to learn from Napoleon's shameless kidnapping activities again, then also look at the ending of that kidnapping. The United States has also had such traditional methods against the Indians for a hundred years, and it is not surprising that they are in cahoots with each other.
    Today's shameless kidnapping by the French colonialists will absolutely not save them from the historical destiny of the inevitable failure of their colonial system.

    “绑架”的后果
    城北
    法国殖民主义者的土匪行为是可耻的。阿尔及利亚民族解放战线五位民族领袖10月底被在阿尔及利亚的法国当局用诡计绑到巴黎后，所谓“法军事法庭”又以所谓“沮丧士气和败坏民心”的罪名进行审判，可能被处死刑，已引起全世界人民的愤怒。
    法国殖民主义者的“绑架”原是有师法的，前一世纪初拿破仑在西印度群岛对付“奴隶”，也有过类似这样的“战绩”。而这件事，却成为“美洲全部历史上最不法不义的事”。
    1801年拿破仑企图把西印度群岛的海地做为美洲“法兰西大帝国计划”的重要基地，派了黎克勒将军率领五十四艘战舰和二万九千精兵来攻打海地。就在一个时期的侵略活动以后，法国的“精兵”损失惨重，黎克勒将军向拿破仑的苦诉也正像今天法国殖民主义者在非洲所遭受的惨状一样，他说：
      “让你对我军的损失得到一个概念，你知道第七部队初到这里的时候是一千三百九十五个强健的人；现在只有八十六个半病的人尚在军中，一百零七人在医院里，其余的都死去了。
      “第十一轻装步兵队在这里登陆时是一千九百个强健的人，现在只有一百六十三人还能服役，有二百人在医院里。
    “第七十一部队原有一千个强健的人，现在只有十七个人在军中，有一百零七人在医院里。……
    “这样，请你想像一下我在这个国度里的处境吧，在这个国度里，内战进行已达十年，而那些叛军又认定我们是要把他们置于奴隶的地位……”
    仅在一个半世纪前，人民对于可耻的殖民者也是这样英勇地在战斗的。黎克勒患“黄热病”死于海地之前，他伪装“和平”，邀请了“叛军”的领袖、全美洲革命运动所产生的杰出人物杜桑到他那里开会，到来之后，便做出这件“美洲全部历史上最不法不义的事”，将杜桑抓起来加上镣铐，用船运往法国，任意地判了罪行。这位海地人民的英雄杜桑在1803年死在法国监狱中。
    这次“不法不义”的行动的结局是这样的：为法国拿破仑的屠杀所吓倒的是他自己，除了黎克勒死于黄热病之外，同年10月，法军向人民投降。以后拿破仑增兵四万三千人去增援，又死了三万五千人，当惨败的舰队将八千老弱残兵运回国去的途中，却为他的不义的老朋友——英国舰队俘去作奴隶，法国“精兵”全军复没了。
    在那个世纪里，这类的故事，也不是只此一个。在1832年美国军队在佛罗里达州屠杀印第安族的西米诺尔人时，七年中，七个将军都打了败仗。美国的一位未来的总统泰洛将军和当时的杰克逊将军，就“在保证安全的条件下，怂恿西米诺尔人伟大领袖阿西拉出席和平会议。但是阿西拉来了后，立即被人猛击头部，绑了起来，关在地牢，……不要忘记，这一切都是美国军队奉美国总统的命令干的。”西米诺尔人的伟大领袖阿西拉在“绑架”后虽然还不到一年就死在狱中了，但是西米诺尔人直到今天，仍然活在佛罗里达的土地上。那个时期，在印第安人反对美国“领土扩张”的斗争中，到处都是一样，一个阿西拉死了，更多的阿西拉成长出来。
    今天的法国殖民者又一次要学习拿破仑的无耻的绑架活动，那就同时也看看那一次绑架的结局吧。美国在一百年来对印第安人也有这样的传统手法，他们在一鼻孔出气，也是不足为奇的。
    今天法国殖民者的无耻绑架，绝对挽救不了他们殖民制度最后必然失败的历史命运。
