    US Subversive Activities Against Eastern European Countries
    Chen Youwei
    U.S. Secretary of State Dulles recently delivered a foreign policy speech at the Dallas Council on World Affairs in Texas, shamelessly portraying the United States as an "inspirer" of freedom and independence. He said: "Our country has encouraged political independence and human freedom around the world from the beginning." He believes that the people of Eastern European countries "have no reason to doubt that we (the United States) are their loyal friends—friends who share the same aspirations as them." How exactly has the United States encouraged "independence and freedom" from the beginning, and how has it shown its "loyalty" and "aspirations" to the people of Eastern Europe? Let's take a look at the facts over the years.
    "The entire policy of the United States is..."
    Let us first turn the pages of history back to the 1920s....
    After the October Revolution and World War I, in Hungary and Slovakia, the revolutionary people overthrew the rule of landlords and capitalists and established Soviet regimes under the leadership of the working class. Revolutionary committees were also established in Poland. The shaking of the old European system greatly shocked the imperialists, who colluded to brutally suppress the people of Eastern Europe by any means. The United States played an important role in this. Herbert Hoover, who later became President of the United States, stated in 1921: "During the armistice period (referring to after World War I), the entire policy of the United States was to prevent Europe from going down the Bolshevik road as much as possible..." Hoover, then serving as the U.S. Federal Government's Food Commissioner, presided over the "American Relief Administration" in Europe. Its main task was to provide food and dollar aid to the White armies in Central and Eastern Europe to suppress revolutionary movements.
    As for the United States' activities in Hungary at the time, European newspapers in 1920 also reported that Captain Gregory, the American Relief Administration's plenipotentiary representative in Southern Europe, organized the counter-revolutionary rebellion in Budapest, subverting the Hungarian Soviet Republic, which had existed for more than three months, because he possessed "the power to supervise food and was good at utilizing the political situation."
    Imperialism thus destroyed the revolutionary movements in Eastern European countries, leaving the people of these countries under fascist terror rule and the cruel exploitation of imperialist monopoly capital for a long time.
    Behind the Counter-Revolutionary Coups
    After World War II, thanks to the victory of the anti-fascist war, Eastern European countries began a new phase of development. However, the imperialists were unwilling to lose their capitalist positions in these countries, which accounted for about one-fifth of the land in Europe. In the early years after the war, they engaged in frantic activities, trying to pull these countries back to their original path. Initially, the United States used its position as a member of the Allied Control Council to interfere in the elections of some Eastern European countries, in order to allow the bourgeoisie to seize power. However, this conspiracy failed because the working-class parties and their allies in Eastern European countries achieved great victories in the elections. Later, the United States turned to plotting counter-revolutionary coups in Eastern European countries. The destructive activities of Mikolajczyk, the reactionary head of the Polish Peasant Party, against the Polish People's Democratic government in 1947; the conspiracy of Ferenc Nagy and Béla Varga, the leaders of the Hungarian Smallholders Party, to violently overthrow the Hungarian democratic government and restore the Horthy fascist regime; and the government crisis created in February 1948 by the withdrawal of twelve ministers by three reactionary parties in Czechoslovakia were all directly instigated by the United States. The U.S. envoys stationed in Eastern European countries at the time were the behind-the-scenes directors of these events. After the failure of the incidents, the United States helped these national traitors flee abroad. Stanton Griffis, who served as the U.S. ambassador to Poland in 1947, later admitted that he gave Mikolajczyk "an American raincoat, a drooping hat, and hid him in a truck driven by a reliable embassy staff member to send him out."
    "Project X" and "X-Day"
    After the failure of the imperialist attempt to restore capitalism in Eastern Europe, the United States decided to change its strategy. In 1948, at a gathering of bankers and stockbrokers in New York, John Foster Dulles, the current U.S. Secretary of State, gave a speech proposing the establishment of an organization to carry out large-scale sabotage activities against the Soviet Union and the people's democracies. This proposal was later developed into the notorious "Project X." According to "U.S. News & World Report," "According to this plan, strong armed groups were to be organized under American command. Assassination of communist leaders would be encouraged. American spies parachuted into Eastern Europe...would be used to coordinate anti-communist activities." This was not enough. In October 1951, the so-called "Mutual Security Act" passed by the U.S. Congress further stipulated the allocation of $100 million to further blatantly encourage subversive and destructive activities against Eastern European countries.
    One of the most rampant manifestations of this sinister activity of U.S. imperialism was the provocative incident created in Berlin on June 17, 1953. On that day, which was pre-determined as "X-Day," West German fascist armed agents, hired by the United States, broke into the democratic sector of Berlin, attacked government agencies, looted stores, and committed murder and arson. According to West Berlin newspapers, the purpose of "X-Day" was to "prepare to reclaim the territory of the Soviet occupation zone..." Although the "X-Day" operation failed, U.S. President Eisenhower announced a special aid package of $50 million to West Berlin the day after the Berlin incident in order to encourage and continue such provocative activities.
    Special Missions of "Special Forces"
    The entire U.S. plan against the people's democracies also included a longer-term plan, which was to prepare to directly use military action to subvert the people's democratic system in Eastern Europe in future new wars. "New York Times" reporter Anthony Leviero revealed a piece of news last August: In the official establishment of the U.S. Army, a so-called "Special Forces" composed of exiles from Eastern European countries is being trained. "An unexpected visitor might be surprised to hear burly sergeants shouting commands in Polish, Czechoslovak, Russian, German, or other languages." This was the impression Leviero gained after visiting this special force at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. In January of this year, Reuters reporter Harris also revealed that in addition to North Carolina, there was also a "secret...special force" stationed in southern West Germany. According to his report, the "mission" of these special forces was to "prepare, in the event of war," to go behind the lines of socialist countries to "conduct guerrilla warfare, sabotage, and riots."
    From the Air to Underground
    The work of slander and rumor-mongering also occupies a very important position in the U.S. opposition to Eastern Europe. One of the most important institutions in this regard is the so-called "Radio Free Europe." This radio station, which was described by the "New York Herald Tribune" as "designed by Americans, founded by Americans, and funded by Americans," is a true voice of evil. It spreads a large number of rumors in various Eastern European languages every day, poisoning the air and confusing people's minds. Not only that, but it also directly calls for and specifically guides the carrying out of sabotage activities against Eastern European countries. Releasing propaganda balloons into Eastern Europe is also one of the criminal activities of this radio station. According to a report in the West German newspaper "Die Welt" in February of this year, "Since 1954, this radio station has released more than 400,000 American balloons from Bavaria, West Germany." In addition to slanderous propaganda, these balloons also carried explosives, which caused loss of life and property in Eastern European countries.
    Shortly after the criminal activity of releasing such balloons was universally condemned by countries around the world, people were shocked by another despicable imperialist espionage activity. In April of this year, an underground tunnel leading to the American-occupied area was discovered in the democratic sector of Berlin. The tunnel was equipped with telephone eavesdropping equipment by American intelligence agencies. At the time of the raid, traces of the Americans' hasty escape remained in the tunnel. U.S. imperialism has truly reached the point of resorting to any means and being all-pervasive in order to carry out sabotage activities against the people's democratic countries.
    The Unhideable Traces
    The U.S. reaction to the recent Hungarian incident was very suspicious. The day after the counter-revolutionary armed riots broke out in Budapest, International News Service quoted a Washington official as saying: "The United States will play the role of an interested bystander." But the facts do not prove this. As mentioned above, Ferenc Nagy and Béla Varga, the two leaders of the Hungarian Smallholders Party, hurriedly flew from the United States to Vienna after the outbreak of the Hungarian incident. Nagy admitted that while he was in the United States, he had developed detailed plans with certain U.S. agencies to transport weapons and personnel to Hungary. Former Hungarian fascists, raised by the United States in West Germany and Austria, wearing American uniforms and carrying American weapons, poured into Hungary batch after batch under the cover of the Red Cross flag.
    During these days, Allen Dulles, the director of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, who is known as the "King of American Spies," successively attended special White House meetings to study the international situation and secret meetings of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee. On November 12, Allen admitted that, except for the exact date, the United States "knew everything about the uprisings in Poland and Hungary in advance."
    On November 14, an Agence France-Presse dispatch from Washington revealed that one of the "leaders of a group that launched the first riot in Budapest" "testified" before the U.S. Senate Internal Security Subcommittee. Isn't the close connection between the rioters who committed murder and arson in Budapest and the fact that they later went to Washington to report obvious enough?
    A Bandit Can't Pretend to Be a Philanthropist
    It is enough to prove without citing more facts what kind of "independence" and "freedom" U.S. Secretary of State Dulles hopes Eastern Europe will achieve, and what his so-called "loyalty" and "aspirations" of the United States to the people of Eastern Europe are. There is a good Arab proverb that says: "Even if the devil is baptized ninety-nine times, he will not become an angel." It is always difficult for a bandit to pretend to be a philanthropist. This large-scale subversive and destructive activity openly carried out by the United States against the people's democratic countries of Eastern Europe, with which it has established normal diplomatic relations, demonstrates the most ferocious aggressiveness of modern imperialism.

    美国对东欧国家的颠覆活动
    陈有为
    美国国务卿杜勒斯最近在美国得克萨斯州达拉斯世界事务委员会发表的外交政策演说中，厚颜无耻地把美国装扮成为自由独立的“鼓舞者”。他说：“我国从一开头就鼓励在全世界实现政治独立和人类自由”。他认为东欧各国“人民没有任何理由可以怀疑我们（美国）不是他们的忠诚的朋友——同他们抱着同样愿望的朋友。”究竟美国是怎样从一开头就来鼓励“独立自由”，又是怎样来表现它对东欧人民的“忠诚”和“愿望”的呢？我们还是来看看许多年来的事实吧。
    “美国的全部政策是……”
    先让我们把历史的篇章翻到二十年代去……。
    十月革命和第一次世界大战后，在匈牙利和斯洛伐克，革命的人民曾经推翻地主和资本家的统治，建立了在工人阶级领导下的苏维埃政权。在波兰也成立了革命委员会。欧洲旧制度的动摇大大地震惊了帝国主义者，它们纠集起来不择手段地对东欧人民进行血腥的镇压。而美国就在其中扮演了重要角色。后来曾任美国总统的胡佛在1921年表示：“在休战时期中（指第一次世界大战后）美国的全部政策，是尽其所能地防止欧洲走上布尔什维克的道路……。”胡佛当时以美国联邦政府粮食全权委员的身份主持了在欧洲的“美国救济署”。它的主要任务是以粮食和美元援助中欧和东欧各国的白卫军来镇压革命运动。
    至于美国当时在匈牙利的活动，1920年的欧洲报纸也有报道：美国救济署驻南欧的全权代表格列果利上尉，因为拥有“粮食监督的大权和善于利用政治形势”而组织了布达佩斯的反革命叛变，颠覆了曾经存在三个多月的匈牙利苏维埃共和国。
    帝国主义就这样地摧毁了东欧各国的革命运动，使这些国家的人民在很长一个时期内处于法西斯恐怖统治和帝国主义垄断资本的残酷剥削之下。
    在反革命政变的幕后
    第二次世界大战以后，由于反法西斯战争的胜利，东欧各国开始了新的发展。但是帝国主义不甘心在占整个欧洲土地约五分之一的这些国家内丧失掉资本主义的阵地。它们在战后最初几年内进行了疯狂的活动，想把这些国家从新拉回到原来的道路上去。美国起初利用盟国管制委员会委员的身份企图干涉一些东欧国家的选举，使资产阶级取得政权。但这个阴谋由于东欧各国的工人阶级政党及其同盟者在选举中取得了巨大的胜利而未能得逞。以后，美国就转而策划东欧各国的反动政变。1947年波兰农民党的反动头子米科拉兹克对波兰人民民主政权的破坏活动，匈牙利小农党党魁费伦茨·纳吉和贝拉·瓦尔加企图暴力推翻匈牙利民主政府、恢复霍尔蒂法西斯政权的阴谋，1948年2月捷克斯洛伐克三个反动政党以撤回十二个部长的行动所制造的政府危机，都是美国所直接指使的。美国当时驻东欧各国的使节就是这些事件的幕后导演者。在事变失败以后，美国又帮助这些民族叛徒逃亡国外。1947年曾任美国驻波兰大使的史坦敦·格里菲斯后来承认说，他当时曾给了米科拉兹克“一件美国雨衣，一顶下垂的帽子，把他藏在一辆由一个可靠的使馆工作人员驾驶的卡车里送了出去。”
      “X计划”和“X日”
    在帝国主义企图在东欧复辟资本主义的计划破产以后，美国决定改变自己的策略。1948年在纽约举行的一次银行家和股票商的集会上，现任美国国务卿的约翰·杜勒斯即席发表演说，主张成立一个对苏联和人民民主国家进行大规模破坏活动的组织。这个主张后来就被发展成为臭名昭著的“X计划”。据“美国新闻与世界报道”透露，“根据这个计划，要在美国指挥下组织坚强的武装小组。暗杀共产党领袖的事情将被鼓励。用降落伞降落到东欧的美国间谍……将用来配合反共活动。”这还不够，1951年10月美国国会通过的所谓“共同安全法”，更规定拨款一亿美元，来进一步明目张胆地鼓励对东欧国家进行颠覆破坏活动。
    美帝国主义这种罪恶活动的一个最猖狂的表现，是1953年6月17日在柏林制造的挑衅事件。在被预定称为“X日”的那一天，受美国雇佣的西德法西斯武装特务，闯入柏林民主区，袭击政府机关，抢劫商店，杀人放火。据西柏林的报纸透露，“X日”的目的是“准备收回苏联占领区的国土……”。“X日”的行动虽然遭到了失败，但是美国总统艾森豪威尔在柏林事件的第二天就宣布给西柏林五千万美元的特别援助，以便鼓励和继续这种挑衅活动。
    “特种部队”的特种任务
    美国反对人民民主国家的整个计划中，还包含着更长远的打算，就是准备在未来的新战争中，直接用军事行动来颠覆东欧的人民民主制度。“纽约时报”记者安东尼·勒维罗在去年8月透露了一个消息：在美国陆军的正式编制中，正在训练着一支由东欧各国亡命之徒组成的所谓“特种部队”。“一个不速之客听到身材魁梧的军曹用波兰话、捷克斯洛伐克话、俄国话、德国话或其他语言大声喊口令时，可能也会感到惊讶。”——这就是勒维罗在访问了美国北卡罗来纳州布拉哥堡地方的这支特种部队后所得的印象。今年1月间，路透社记者哈里斯又透露说，除了北卡罗来纳州以外，在西德南部也驻扎着一支“秘密的……特种部队”。据他报道，这些特种部队的“任务是准备在一旦发生战争时”，到社会主义国家后方去“进行游击战、破坏活动和暴动”。
        从空中到地下
    诽谤造谣的工作，在美国反对东欧的活动中，也占有十分重要的地位。在这方面的一个最主要的机构就是所谓“自由欧洲”电台。被“纽约先驱论坛报”称为“由美国人设计，美国人创办，美国人出钱”的这个电台，是真正的罪恶之音。它以东欧各种语言每天散布着大量的谣言，毒化空气，蛊惑人心。不但如此，它还直接号召和具体指导进行对东欧国家的破坏活动。向东欧施放宣传气球，也是这个电台的罪恶活动之一。据西德汉堡的“世界报”在今年2月间报道，“从1954年以来，这个电台已从西德巴伐利亚放出了为数达四十多万个美国气球。”除了造谣污蔑的宣传品外，这些气球还带有爆炸物，它们在东欧各国造成了生命和财产的损失。
    在施放这种气球的罪恶活动受到世界各国普遍谴责以后不久，人们又被另一件卑鄙的帝国主义间谍活动所震惊。今年4月间，在柏林民主区发现了一条通往美占区的地下坑道，坑道里装有美国特务机关偷听电话的设备。在破获的当时，坑道内还留有美国人匆忙逃走的痕迹。美帝国主义为了对人民民主国家进行破坏活动，真是已经到了不择手段和无孔不入的地步。
      掩不住的蛛丝马迹
    对于这次匈牙利事件，美国的反应是非常可疑的。在布达佩斯爆发反革命武装暴乱以后的第二天，国际新闻社就引用一个华盛顿官员的话说：“美国将扮演一个有兴趣的旁观者的角色”。但是事实却并不能证明这一点。上面已经提到过的匈牙利小农党的两个党魁费伦茨·纳吉和贝拉·瓦尔加，他们在匈牙利事件爆发以后匆匆忙忙地从美国飞到了维也纳。纳吉承认他在美国的时候，曾经同美国的某些机关制定了运输武器和人员到匈牙利去的详细计划。被美国豢养在西德和奥地利的前匈牙利法西斯分子，穿着美式军服，拿着美国武器，在红十字旗帜的掩盖下一批一批地涌到匈牙利去。
    在这些日子里，被称为“美国间谍大王”的美国中央情报局局长艾伦·杜勒斯，接连地参加了研究国际局势的白宫特别会议和美国参议院外交委员会的秘密会议。11月12日，艾伦承认说，除了确切的日期以外，美国在事先“就已知道有关波兰和匈牙利的暴动的一切情况了”。
    11月14日，法新社的一则华盛顿电讯透露说，有一个“在布达佩斯发动第一次暴动的一个集团的领袖”，在美国参议院国内安全小组委员会“作证”。在布达佩斯杀人放火的暴徒事后到华盛顿来进行汇报，这两者之间的密切的联系难道还不够明显吗？
      强盗难扮慈善家
    不需要再举出更多的事实就足以证明，美国国务卿杜勒斯所希望东欧实现的是什么样的“独立”和“自由”，而他所说的美国对东欧人民的“忠诚”和“愿望”又是什么东西。有一句阿拉伯谚语说得好：“魔鬼即使受过九十九次洗礼，也不会变成一个天使”。强盗要装成慈善家总是困难的。美国对同自己建有正常外交关系的东欧人民民主国家公然进行的这种大规模的颠覆破坏活动，表现了现代帝国主义最凶恶的侵略性。
