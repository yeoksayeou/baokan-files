    Shedding the Shackles of Slavery, Starting a New Life
    Over Ten Thousand Yi People Settle Down
    Xinhua News Agency, Zhaojue, November 28th (Xinhua News Agency reporter Yu Jingqi): In the Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture of Sichuan Province, over ten thousand households of slaves have gained freedom through democratic reform, moved into new homes, and started new lives.

    In recent months, new mud houses covered with Yi ethnic "tile boards" (wooden boards split with knives) or straw have continuously appeared in many villages and forts in this mountainous area. When moving into their new homes, people joyfully held the "Erca Su" ceremony, sprinkling clear water that had been soaked in red-hot stones inside the house to symbolize good fortune. Some even bought a small amount of wine and drank with their neighbors according to custom.

    These farmers, who had almost nothing in life after gaining freedom, settled down entirely with the care of the People's Government and the assistance of the working masses. The People's Government provided them with resettlement subsidies, as well as resettlement loans and a large amount of relief grain. The farmers in the same village actively helped build houses and provided their surplus tile boards and wood to support them. Zhaojue County has already built more than 290 new houses. In Gou Lou Township of this county, more than 40 former slaves who had nowhere to live now have necessary utensils such as iron pots, wooden spoons, and water-carrying buckets. Every two households have a cow, and many people also have livestock such as chickens and pigs.

    The former slaves in similar situations in Leibo, Jinyang, Jialuo and other counties have basically been resettled.

    Many people have gotten married after settling down. In the Zhaojue Fucheng District alone, more than 80 couples have married. Children of former slaves have also enrolled in the Zhaojue and Wenba Ethnic Primary Schools.

    This year, in the democratic reforms carried out through peaceful consultation in the autonomous prefecture, approximately 40,000 "Guozhuang Waizi" - people from the completely disenfranchised slave class in the old Yi society - were liberated. Those who have settled down are a portion of those who were homeless. Currently, there are still 10,000 people in the same situation without houses, and some who have already settled down are still living collectively. The People's Government is continuing to help them build houses and purchase utensils.

### 摆脱奴隶枷锁　开始新的生活  上万彝民安了家

    摆脱奴隶枷锁　开始新的生活
    上万彝民安了家
    新华社昭觉28日电　新华社记者于竞祁报道：四川省凉山彝族自治州已经有上万户奴隶在民主改革中得到自由迁入新居安家，开始了新的生活。
    在最近几个月中，这个山区的许多村堡中连续出现了一座座盖着彝族“瓦板”（用刀剖的木板）或稻草的新土房。人们在迁入新居的时候，欢欣鼓舞地举行了“尔擦苏”的仪式，把浸过烧红石块的清水洒在屋内表示吉祥，有的还按照风俗买了少量的酒和邻人共饮。
    这些得到自由以后生活上几乎一无所有的农民，完全依靠人民政府的关怀和劳动群众的协助而安家的。人民政府发给他们安家补助费，又发放了安家贷款和大批救济粮。同村的农民积极协助修建住屋，拿出自己多余的瓦板和木料来支援他们。昭觉县已经建成二百九十多座新房。这个县的苟娄乡四十多个无家可归的过去的奴隶，现在有了铁锅、木匙、背水桶等必需用具。每两户人有一头牛，很多人还有了鸡、猪等家畜。
    雷波、金阳、呷洛等县同样情况的过去的奴隶，已经基本上都得到了安置。
    许多人定居以后结了婚，只昭觉附城区结婚的就有八十多对。昭觉和温坝两所民族小学里，还有从前的奴隶的子女入了学。
    今年，自治州在和平协商方式的民主改革中，解放了约四万“锅庄娃子”——彝族旧社会的奴隶阶层中完全丧失自由的人。这些安家的就是其中一部分无家可归的人。目前，还有一万个同样情况的人没有房屋，同时有一部分已经安家的还是集体居住，人民政府正在继续帮助他们修建房屋和添置用具。
