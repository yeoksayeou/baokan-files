Xinhua News Agency, November 21st dispatch from New York: After returning to New York from the Middle East on November 19th, United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskjöld held talks with diplomats from various parties who are currently here. Sources say that British Foreign Secretary Lloyd and French Foreign Minister Pineau continued to insist during their talks with Hammarskjöld that they would not withdraw their troops from Egypt unless the UN Emergency Force "maintains security in the canal area."

A United Press report stated that US officials have been waiting for Hammarskjöld to return "in order to understand whether he has persuaded Egypt to allow the United Nations to occupy the Suez Canal Zone." They call this "the fundamental issue in all negotiations between the United Nations and Egypt."

They said, "Some system must be established that allows UN forces to be stationed in Egypt without any objections from Colonel Nasser."

Xinhua News Agency, November 21st dispatch from Washington: Israeli Ambassador to the United States Abba Eban publicly declared on a television broadcast on November 18th that Israel is unwilling to return to the state of Israel-Egypt relations before it invaded Egypt.

He stated that Israel intends to keep its troops in Egypt's Sinai Peninsula until it is assured of "satisfactory conditions."

He even said that the United Nations cannot force Israel to accept the United Nations' conditions in the Israel-Egypt dispute.

    英法美坚持联合国部队占领苏伊士运河
    以驻美大使透露以色列不打算从埃及撤兵
    据新华社21日讯　纽约消息：联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德19日从中东回到纽约后，同正在这里的各方面的外交人士举行了会谈。有消息说，英国外交大臣劳埃德和法国外交部长比诺在同哈马舍尔德会谈时继续坚持：除非联合国紧急部队“维持运河地区的治安”，否则他们不准备从埃及撤出军队。
    合众社的一条消息说，美国官员们一直在等待哈马舍尔德回来，“以便了解他是否已经说服埃及允许联合国占领苏伊士运河区”。他们把这称之为“联合国和埃及之间的一切谈判中的基本问题”。
    他们说，“必须制定某种制度，让联合国部队驻在埃及而不受纳赛尔中校的任何反对意见的影响。”
    新华社21日讯　华盛顿消息：以色列驻美国大使阿巴·伊班18日在电视广播节目上公开宣称，以色列不愿意恢复和它侵略埃及以前的以色列—埃及之间的状态。
    他表示，在确定获得“令人满意的条件”以前，以色列打算把它的军队留在埃及的西奈半岛上。
    他甚至说，联合国不能强迫以色列在以色列—埃及争端上接受联合国的条件。
