    On November 16th, the clear sunshine shone on the Daliang Mountains, painting the towering mountains with bright colors. On this day, the Central慰问团 [慰问团 literally translates as "comfort group" but is a delegation sent to express sympathy or appreciation] traveled thousands of miles to reach Zhaojue, the seat of the Liangshan彝族 [Yi ethnic group] Autonomous Prefecture People's Committee.

    Zhaojue, the Liangshan capital known for its numerous rebellions against the Qing Dynasty and the Kuomintang reactionary rulers, today welcomes the Central慰问团, representatives of the Central government and Chairman Mao from Beijing, with unparalleled joy. Arches adorned with evergreen pine branches, countless colorful flags waving in the air, and people's joyful smiles filled the entire city with a festive atmosphere.

    The girls were all dressed in their most beautiful clothes. Short jackets embroidered with various colored laces, exquisite silver ornaments, and multi-pleated long skirts – people only wear these costumes during festive events.

    Huge banners across the streets were written in both Yi and Han languages: "Long Live the Great Unity of the People of All Ethnic Groups in China!" "Welcome Our Relatives, the Central慰问团!"

    At 3:30 p.m., when Wang Yifu, deputy head of the Central慰问团, Guo Ji Mugu, Wa Zha Muji, and A Hou Lumu Zi led the entire Second Sub-group into the mile-long welcoming line, people were overjoyed. Countless bouquets of flowers expressed the people's hearts, and the smoke from firecrackers, the sound of gongs and drums, and cheers enveloped the entire bank of the Zhaojue River.

    A Yi girl ran to Deputy Head Wang Yifu and presented a large bouquet of beautiful colorful flowers. She answered Wang Yifu's questions and snuggled beside him for a long time. A few years ago, this little girl, named Jia Ri Wuniu, was still a shepherd, but now she is a second-grade student.

    Twelve children from Zhaojue Ethnic Primary School took light steps to perform the "Buckwheat Dance" and the "Market Dance." They beautifully demonstrated the Yi people's love for peaceful labor and prosperous life.

    When the慰问团 team reached the line formed by the headmen of the Zhaojue Affiliated Urban District, six representatives of the upper echelons presented large bunches of flowers on behalf of all the headmen in the district. Many of them have already joined the workforce and hold positions such as deputy county head and section chief. After the Democratic Reform, their lives are now very good.

    More than 3,000 people from five townships in the Affiliated Urban District sent out the Yi people's unique cheers of "喊号子" [a type of traditional call or chant]. Twenty-four agricultural cooperatives have been established in this district after the Democratic Reform, and many in the welcoming crowd are members of these cooperatives. Yi people from Longen Township, more than seventy miles from the city, arrived in Zhaojue two days ago to welcome the慰问团. Mai Na Niu, an old woman in her seventies, had not been to Zhaojue for many years, but this time she insisted on coming here with her family. She spoke the words of all the Yi people in Liangshan: "The慰问团 represents Chairman Mao in visiting us, and there is no one more dear to us in the world than this. I want to express my heart."

    昭觉河畔迎亲人
    新华社记者　于竞祁
    11月16日，晴朗的阳光照耀着大凉山区，雄峻的群山抹上了明亮的色彩。这一天，中央慰问团经过千山万水来到了凉山彝族自治州人民委员会所在地——昭觉。
    昭觉，这个曾多次反抗清朝和国民党反动统治者而著称的凉山首府，今天以无比的欢欣迎接来自北京的中央和毛主席的代表——中央慰问团。一座座饰满长青松枝的牌坊，招展空中的无数彩旗，人们洋溢着喜气的笑容，使全城充满了节日的景象。
    姑娘们都穿上了她们最美丽的衣裳。镶着各色花边的短袄，精巧的银饰，多褶的长裙，人们只在喜庆大事时才穿戴这些服饰。
    过街的巨幅横标上，用彝、汉两种文字写着：“中国各族人民大团结万岁！”“欢迎我们的亲人中央慰问团！”
    下午三时半，当中央慰问团副团长王一夫、果基木古、瓦渣木基、阿候鲁木子率领第二分团全体人员步入长达一里的欢迎行列中时，人们欢欣鼓舞。无数的花束表达了人们的心意，鞭炮的硝烟、锣鼓声和欢呼声笼罩了整个昭觉河畔。
    一个彝族小姑娘跑到王一夫副团长面前，献上了一大束美丽的彩花。她回答着王一夫的问话，长久地依偎在他的身边。几年前，这个叫加日五妞的小姑娘还是一个放羊的孩子，而现在她已是小学二年级的学生了。
    十二个昭觉民族小学的儿童迈开轻盈的小步演出“荞子舞”和“赶场舞”。他们优美地表现出彝族人民对和平劳动和富裕生活的热爱。
    当慰问团的队伍走到由昭觉附城区头人组成的行列前时，六个上层人士代表全区头人献上大把的花束。他们中许多人已参加了工作，担任着县的副县长、科长等职务。他们在民主改革后，现在生活都很好。
    附城区五个乡的三千多群众向慰问团发出彝族人民特有的欢呼“喊号子”。这个区在民主改革后已建立了二十四个农业社，欢迎的人群中有许多都是社员。离城七十多里的隆恩乡彝民，为了迎接慰问团，两天前就赶到了昭觉。七十多岁的老妈妈麦娜妞多年没到过昭觉了，这次她坚持和家人来到这里。她说出了凉山全体彝族人民的话：“慰问团代表毛主席来看我们，世上没有比这更亲的人了，我要来表达我的心意。”
