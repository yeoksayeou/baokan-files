    "The City of Electrical Engineering"
    Sì Chéng
    Walking along a dedicated railway line on the outskirts of Xi'an, you are surrounded by tall factory buildings, office buildings, and dormitories, some already completed, some still under construction, stretching as far as the eye can see. In the open spaces between the many buildings, large quantities of construction materials are piled up.

    This is what people call the "City of Electrical Engineering." The modern Xi'an Power Capacitor Factory, Xi'an High-Voltage Porcelain Factory, and Xi'an Instrument Factory are all being built here. Last autumn, when I passed through here, I only saw a few dormitory buildings under construction, surrounded entirely by farmland; from the dormitories to the newly built dedicated railway line, there was only a narrow path, with weeds growing by the side. Now, as I walk and look around, the old scene is gone.

    Following the scaffolding, I climbed onto a chimney that was under construction. From here, looking into the distance, more than a dozen huge factory buildings have been erected. The factories are connected to each other by dedicated railway lines, and the factory areas, office areas, and dormitory areas are crisscrossed by a network of roads. Heavy-duty trucks shuttle back and forth, delivering various prefabricated components, building materials, and mechanical equipment to the construction sites, and large cranes extend their huge arms, installing prefabricated components into factory buildings... This area is about six li long from east to west and about five li wide from north to south.

    Seeing this scene, I have indescribable feelings. This is the site of the capital of the Han Dynasty. The capitals of many dynasties, such as Qin, Han, Sui, and Tang, were also located in this area. However, which dynasty has ever seen such a thriving construction scene?

    Three months ago, at the construction site of the Xi'an Power Capacitor Factory, I interviewed a worker who was supervising workers tamping the foundation: "When will this factory building be built? Can it be done this year?" "No problem!" He looked at me, afraid that I wouldn't believe him, and added, "Come and see in three months, and the main structure of the factory building will definitely be built."

    Sure enough, the main factory building has been built, and the equipment installation project has also begun. Those workers who were laying the foundation have long gone to work on other projects.

    I walked into this huge factory building. Looking from one end to the other, it is like a tunnel without a roof, straight and long. The industrialization and mechanization of this factory building construction are quite high, reaching about 60%. Except for the foundation and brick walls, everything else is installed with prefabricated components.

    Power capacitors for improving the power factor will enable power plants across the country to increase power generation and transmission equipment, thoroughly improving the situation of wasted electricity. Longitudinal compensation capacitors will enable the Xiaofengman Hydropower Station and the future hydropower stations built on the Yangtze River, Yellow River, and Huai River to save a large amount of electricity and transmit it to more distant industrial areas and rural areas; filter capacitors will make radio broadcasts and radio fax transmissions particularly clear...

    A capacitor is a very precise product. The main raw material used to make it—capacitor paper—is fifteen to twenty times thinner than ordinary paper. After it is made, there must be no impurities inside, and the internal bubbles must be reduced to the minimum limit. In order to meet this requirement, in addition to having very perfect ventilation, dust removal, and high-vacuum equipment, the indoor temperature of this factory must be maintained at about 24 degrees Celsius, and the relative humidity must be maintained at about 60%, like spring all year round. The employees working here must wear spotless white coats, and they must change into clean shoes before entering the door.

    Past the Capacitor Factory is the High-Voltage Porcelain Factory. The scale of this factory is even larger, with a large factory building occupying dozens of acres. Its main workshops—mud refining, billet making, and tunnel kiln—will all be produced in an automated and mechanized manner. This factory will be completed in 1958. At that time, it will produce more than 100 kinds of electrical porcelain products and will produce 220,000-volt high-voltage porcelain bottles that all electrical porcelain factories in China cannot currently produce.

    In this factory, a modern gas station and boiler room will also be built, with the scale and equipment being first-class in the country. The construction of this modern factory is being stepped up. The factory buildings and material warehouses of the carpentry workshop, and the office building have been basically completed.

    Leaving here, I went to visit the construction site of the Xi'an Instrument Factory. After passing through many building complexes and walking for nearly an hour, I still hadn't found this place. I walked to a piece of farmland and asked the workers who were exploring ancient tombs. They said with a smile, "It's right under your feet." I was taken aback and looked carefully. In the middle of many ancient tombs, there was a ditch formed by an ancient road. Other than that, there was nothing else. I never imagined that the largest instrument factory in the country will be built here next year, producing various industrial instruments that China could not produce in the past. The person accompanying me on the visit told me that the precision requirements of the instruments are even higher than those of capacitors, and the equipment of this factory is even more perfect than that of the capacitor factory!

    In order to understand the production characteristics of these factories, I also visited the technical school. The equipment of this school is very complete. In addition to teaching equipment, there is also a complete internship factory. Currently, there are more than 1,000 students studying here, all of whom are junior high school graduates. Soon, they will become excellent electricians, fitters, blacksmiths, foundry workers, and planing workers. Next year, a large instrument technical school will also be built here. In the future, this "City of Electrical Engineering" will become a base to support similar factories across the country, not only sending manpower to similar factories through technical schools, but also training technicians and workers for various places in the factories. At present, the preparatory office of this "City of Electrical Engineering" has helped similar factories train technical personnel.

    During the visit, I met many builders of the "City of Electrical Engineering." Some of them come from both sides of the Yangtze River, some from both sides of the Yellow River, and some from both sides of the Huai River and Songhua River. Whether they are engineering technicians or workers, they are all striving to build the "City of Electrical Engineering" as soon as possible with creative labor. (Attached picture)

    The appearance of the ancient city of Xi'an is changing, and many modern factory buildings are being built here.

    “电工之城”
    嗣澄
    沿着西安市郊一条铁路专用线走去，周围全是高大的厂房、办公楼和宿舍楼，有的已经建成，有的正在建设，望也望不到头。在那许多建筑物中间的空地上，堆放着大批建筑材料。
    这就是人们所说的“电工之城”。现代化的西安电力电容器厂、西安高压电瓷厂、西安仪表厂都在这里兴建。去年秋天我经过这里的时候，只看见几幢宿舍楼在施工，周围全是庄稼地；由宿舍楼到新建的铁路专用线，只有一条羊肠小道，道旁长着杂草。现在，我一边走，一边看，旧日的景象不见了。
    顺着脚手架，我上到一个正在施工的烟囱上。从这里向远处望去，有十多座巨大的厂房已经建立起来。工厂和工厂中间有铁路专用线相连，厂区、办公区和宿舍区中间，密布着蛛网般的道路。载重汽车像穿梭一样，把各种预制构件、建筑材料和机械设备送到施工现场，大型起重机伸出巨大的手臂，把预制构件安装成厂房……。这个区域，东西约长六里，南北约宽五里。
    看到这种景象，真有说不出的感慨。这里是汉代都城的遗址。秦、汉、隋、唐等许多朝代的都城也设在这个地区。可是，有哪一个朝代曾经出现过这样蓬蓬勃勃的建设景象？
    三个月以前，我在西安电力电容器厂的施工现场上，访问过一位正在指导工人夯地基的工作人员：“这个厂房什么时候能修起来？今年能行吗？”“没问题！”他看了看我，生怕不相信，又补充了一句：“过三个月来看，厂房的主体结构保管建起来。”
    果真是这样，主厂房已经建设起来了，设备安装工程也开始了，那些打地基的工人早去搞别的工程去了。
    我走进了这座巨大的厂房，从这头往那头一看，像一座没有顶的隧道，又直又长。这个厂房施工的工厂化和机械化程度相当高，达到了60％左右，除了地基和砖墙以外，都是用预制构件安装起来的。
    提高功率因数用的电力电容器，将使全国电厂增大发电和输电设备，彻底改善浪费电力的情况，纵补偿电容器将使小丰满水力发电站和未来的建设在长江、黄河和淮河上的水力发电站，节省出大量的电力，输送到更遥远的工业区和农村去；滤波电容器将使无线电广播和无线电传真特别清楚……。
    电容器是一种非常精密的产品。制造它用的主要原料——电容器纸要比普通纸薄十五倍到二十倍。制成以后，里边不能有杂质，同时内部气泡必须减少到最低的限度。这座工厂为了达到这个要求，除了有十分完善的通风、除尘和具有高真空度的真空设备以外，室内温度要保持在摄氏二十四度左右，相对湿度保持在60％左右，四季都像春天；在这里工作的职工，都要穿着洁白的罩衣，进门还要换上干净的鞋子。
    过了电容器厂就是高压电瓷厂。这个工厂的规模还要大，一个大型厂房就占地几十亩。它的主要车间——炼泥，制坯车间和隧道窑，都将分别按照自动化和机械化的方式生产。这个厂子将要在1958年建成，那个时候，它将生产一百多种电瓷用品，并将生产出我国目前所有电瓷厂都不能生产的二十二万伏的高压电瓷瓶。
    在这座工厂里，还要建设一座现代化的煤气站和锅炉房，规模和设备都是全国第一流的。这座现代化工厂的施工正在加紧进行。木工车间的厂房和材料库，办公楼都已经基本上建成。
    离开这里，我又去访问西安仪表厂的工地。穿过许多建筑群，走了将近一小时，还没有找到这个地方。我走到一片庄稼地上，向正在探查古墓的工人问了一下，他们笑着说：“就在你的脚下。”我吃了一惊，仔细看了看，在许多古墓的中间，是一条古道形成的沟，除这以外，其它任何东西都没有。真想不到，这里明年就要建成全国最大的仪表厂，生产过去我国不能生产的各种工业用仪表。陪着我访问的人告诉我，仪表的精密程度要求比电容器还要高，这个厂子的设备比起电容器厂还要完善得多！
    为了了解这几个厂的生产特点，我又访问了技工学校。这个学校的设备十分完善，除了教学设备以外，还有一个完善的实习工厂。目前，在这里学习的有一千多名学生，他们都是初中毕业。不久，他们将成为优秀的电工、钳工、锻工、铸工和刨工。明年，这里还要建设一座大型的仪表技工学校。将来，这座“电工之城”要成为支援全国同类厂的基地，不仅要通过技工学校向同类厂输送人力，还要在厂子里为各地培养技术人员和工人。目前，这个“电工之城”的筹建处已经帮助同类厂培养技术人员了。
    在访问中，我认识了许多“电工之城”的建设者。他们有的来自长江两岸，有的来自黄河两岸，还有的来自淮河和松花江两岸。无论是工程技术人员或者是工人，都在用创造性的劳动争取赶快把“电工之城”建设起来。（附图片）
    古城西安的面貌在改变中，有许多现代化工厂建筑在这里。
