Xinhua News Agency, 16th: At the Second Plenary Meeting of the First Central Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association, which closed today, a resolution on the current work policy and tasks of the China Democratic National Construction Association was adopted. The resolution pointed out that the current work policy and central tasks of the China Democratic National Construction Association are: to further cultivate and improve the members of industrialists and businessmen to become the backbone elements in the industrial and commercial circles, to assist the state in thoroughly completing the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, and to actively participate in socialist construction.

The resolution stated: While concentrating efforts on socialist construction and thoroughly completing socialist transformation, struggling for the liberation of Taiwan, struggling to continue eliminating the remaining counter-revolutionary forces, struggling to smash the imperialist aggression plots and war-adventurous policies, and striving for lasting world peace are the common tasks of the people of the whole country, including the China Democratic National Construction Association. Among these common tasks, the China Democratic National Construction Association has special tasks in assisting the state in thoroughly completing the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, which are: First, to assist the state in creating conditions for a natural and smooth transition from overall joint state-private ownership to the final realization of socialist ownership by the whole people replacing capitalist ownership; Second, to exert any positive role that is beneficial to socialist construction.

The resolution stated that in order to implement this policy and task, the China Democratic National Construction Association must further consolidate and develop its organization, strengthen ideological education for its members, adopt an educational policy that combines encouragement and criticism, with encouragement as the main focus, and mobilize and help industrialists and businessmen members to take enterprises as their base, and truly achieve: love the motherland, be loyal to the socialist cause; study hard, relate to reality, eliminate capitalism, establish socialism, and prepare conditions ideologically and in life for abandoning exploitation; at the same time, under the leadership of the public side, actively and proactively manage the relationship between public and private cooperation, participate in socialist labor competitions, develop labor habits, fully contribute their expertise and experience, learn socialist management methods and business techniques, and make achievements in business management; in addition, it is necessary to maintain close contact with the masses of industrialists and businessmen, fully reflect their opinions and demands, represent their legitimate interests, unite and lead them to resolutely take the socialist road, and actively participate in the struggle against enemies at home and abroad.

The resolution mentioned that the China Democratic National Construction Association must conscientiously implement the policy of long-term coexistence and mutual supervision between the Chinese Communist Party and the democratic parties in the future. At the same time, it specifically pointed out that accepting the leadership and supervision of the Chinese Communist Party is complementary. Only by resolutely accepting the leadership and supervision of the Communist Party can we overcome our shortcomings and mistakes in our work, and can we correctly exert the role of mutual supervision; and mutual supervision between the Communist Party and the democratic parties is an important method to assist Communist Party members in implementing the mass line, strengthening leadership, and overcoming shortcomings and mistakes in their work. Therefore, mutual supervision between the Communist Party and the democratic parties is very necessary, and there should be no doubts or concerns about this.

The resolution finally pointed out that the key to the implementation of the current work policy and tasks of the China Democratic National Construction Association lies in the initiative and responsibility of organizations at all levels and all members under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, and making unremitting efforts. It should be clearly recognized that only by sincerely accepting the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party can the correctness of the political line of the China Democratic National Construction Association be guaranteed, and can the China Democratic National Construction Association play a positive role in the political life of the country. At the same time, the China Democratic National Construction Association should proactively and actively take on its work in accordance with the spirit of political freedom and organizational independence within the scope of the rights and obligations conferred by the Constitution.

    关于民主建国会当前工作方针、任务的决定
    （摘要）
    新华社16日讯　在今天闭幕的民建第一届中央委员会第二次全体会议上，通过了关于民建当前工作方针、任务的决定。这个决定指出中国民主建国会当前的工作方针和中心任务是：进一步培养和提高工商业者会员成为工商界中的骨干分子，协助国家彻底完成对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，积极参加社会主义建设。
    决定说：在集中力量进行社会主义建设彻底完成社会主义改造的同时，为解放台湾而斗争，为继续肃清反革命残余势力而斗争，为粉碎帝国主义的侵略阴谋和战争冒险政策、争取世界持久和平而斗争，这是包括民建在内的全国人民的共同任务。在这些共同任务中，民建在协助国家彻底完成对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造工作方面，还有着特殊的任务，这就是：第一、协助国家在从全面公私合营到最后实现以生产资料的全民所有制来代替资本家所有制的转变中，创造瓜熟蒂落、水到渠成的条件；第二、发挥任何一点对于社会主义建设有利的积极作用。
    决定说，为了贯彻这一方针任务，民建必须进一步巩固和发展组织，加强对会员的思想教育工作，采取有鼓励、有批评、以鼓励为主的教育方针，动员和帮助工商业者会员以企业为基地，真正做到：热爱祖国，效忠社会主义事业；努力学习，联系实际，破除资本主义，建立社会主义，在思想上、生活上为放弃剥削准备条件；同时，在公方领导下，积极主动地搞好公私共事关系，参加社会主义劳动竞赛，养成劳动习惯，充分贡献出自己的专长和经验，学会社会主义经营管理方法和业务技术，在企业经营中作出成绩；此外还要密切联系工商界群众，充分反映他们的意见和要求，代表他们的合法利益，团结、带动他们一道坚决走社会主义的道路，积极参加反对国内外敌人的斗争。
    决定中谈到民建今后必须认真贯彻执行中国共产党和民主党派长期共存、互相监督的方针。同时特别指出，接受中国共产党的领导和互相监督是相辅相成的。只有坚决接受共产党的领导和监督，才能够克服我们在工作中的缺点和错误，才能正确发挥互相监督的作用；而共产党和民主党派之间进行互相监督，又是协助共产党员贯彻群众路线、加强领导、克服工作中的缺点和错误的重要方法。因此，共产党和民主党派之间的互相监督，是十分必要的，对此不应当存有怀疑和顾虑。
    决定最后指出，民建当前工作方针和任务的贯彻实现，关键在于各级组织和全体会员，在中国共产党的领导下，发挥主动负责精神，作坚持不懈的努力。应该明确认识，只有真诚地接受中国共产党的领导，才能保证民建政治路线的正确，才能够使民建在国家的政治生活中发挥良好的作用。同时，民建应当根据宪法赋予的权利义务范围内的政治自由和组织独立性的精神，把自己的工作主动积极地担负起来。
