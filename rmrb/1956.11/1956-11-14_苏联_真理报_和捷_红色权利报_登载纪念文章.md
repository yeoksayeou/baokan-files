Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 12th - Today, "Pravda" published articles written by Mao Zedong, Zhu De, and Soong Ching Ling commemorating the 90th anniversary of the birth of Mr. Sun Yat-sen.
    Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 12th - Czechoslovakian "Red Rights" published an article on the 12th entitled "The Great Chinese Revolutionary and Democrat."
    The article narrated Mr. Sun Yat-sen's early activities and pointed out that this great revolutionary recognized that the Chinese people's immense suffering and China's backwardness could only be eliminated by taking the revolutionary road, and that reform or changing rulers alone would not work.
    After Mr. Sun Yat-sen's death, the Kuomintang increasingly deviated from the program of its founder and eventually became a direct lackey of imperialism. The article concluded by saying that the Chinese Communist Party inherited Mr. Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary cause. Thanks to the achievements of the Communist Party, the immortal words of this great revolutionary of the Chinese people have been realized.

    苏联“真理报”和捷“红色权利报”登载纪念文章
    新华社莫斯科12日电　今天“真理报”登载了毛泽东、朱德和宋庆龄写的纪念孙中山先生诞辰九十周年的文章。
    据新华社布拉格12日电　捷克斯洛伐克“红色权利报”12日发表了题为“伟大的中国革命家和民主主义者”的文章。
    文章叙述了孙中山先生早年的活动后指出，这位伟大的革命家认识到，中国人民的巨大苦难和中国的落后，只有采取革命的道路才能消除，仅仅靠改良或者更换统治者是没有用的。
    中山先生逝世后，国民党越来越背离它的缔造者的纲领，最终成了帝国主义的直接仆从。文章最后说，中国共产党继承了孙中山先生的革命事业。由于共产党的成就，中国人民的这位伟大的革命者的不朽遗言实现了。
