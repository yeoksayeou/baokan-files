    Fish Farming in Nanwan Reservoir
    (Our report) Henan Province's Nanwan Reservoir has already stocked over 2.7 million fish of various species including carp, grass carp, silver carp, and bighead carp. It is expected that in one year, each of these fish seedlings will grow to over three catties (approximately 1.5 kilograms) in weight, and there will be 6 to 7 million catties (3,000-3,500 metric tons) of fresh fish available for the people to eat.

    Nanwan Reservoir is over forty li (approximately 20 kilometers) long and four li (approximately 2 kilometers) wide at its widest point. The surrounding mountains are lush with vegetation, and the water contains rich organic matter, making it suitable for fish farming. This spring, the Nanwan Reservoir Aquatic Product Management Station sent people to Hubei and other places five times to purchase a total of more than 5 million fish fry, and opened three fish ponds near the reservoir for trial breeding. Now the fish fry have grown to be more than three fingers wide and about the size of a palm.

    According to the technician at the Nanwan Reservoir Aquatic Product Management Station, comparing the number of fish raised this year to the area of the reservoir, the fish farming efficiency has only reached 20%, and there is still great potential. They are planning to clear the bottom of the lake at the end of this year and raise more fish next year.

    南湾水库养鱼
    本报讯　河南省南湾水库已经放养了鲤、鲭、鰽、鲢等鱼种二百七十多万尾。预计一年以后，这些鱼秧每条可以长到三斤重以上，并且将有六百到七百万斤鲜鱼，供应人民食用。
    南湾水库长约四十多华里，最宽处有四里，沿岸山多草肥，水里含有丰富的有机质，适宜养鱼。南湾水库水产管理站在今年春天曾先后五次派人到湖北等地购回鱼苗共五百多万尾，并在水库附近开辟三个鱼塘试养。现在鱼苗已长到三指多宽，一巴掌大小了。
    据南湾水库水产管理站技术员谈，今年养鱼的尾数和水库的面积比较，养鱼效率只发挥了20％，潜力还很大。他们正打算在今年年底清理湖底，明年将养更多的鱼。
