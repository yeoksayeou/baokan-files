    "Nationalities Hospital"
    The Chang'an Branch of the People's Hospital of the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Prefecture in Guangxi Province is the largest and best-equipped hospital in the mountainous area of Guangxi Province. Since its establishment in the spring of 1953, it has provided treatment for various diseases to people of all ethnic groups in the vicinity. People have become accustomed to calling it the "Nationalities Hospital."

    “民族医院”
    广西省桂西僮族自治州人民医院长安分院，是广西省山区的一座规模最大，设备较完善的医院。它自1953年春建立以来，为附近各族人民进行了各种疾病的治疗。人们已习惯地把它称为“民族医院”。这位来自大苗山高武乡的苗族农民就要出院了，医生们在给他做最后的检查。（赵黄岗摄　广西日报社稿）
