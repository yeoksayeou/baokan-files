    Xinhua News Agency report by Xinhua News Agency reporter Li Feng: According to recent statistics from the State Statistical Bureau, China's design team (including surveying and mapping personnel providing data for design) has increased to over 100,000 people, and more than 140 design institutions have been established, with over 60 belonging to the industrial system. Design personnel in the industrial system account for about 50% of the country's total design personnel, an increase of 110% compared to 1953. Design personnel in other systems such as railways, transportation, postal and telecommunications, water conservancy, and civil construction have increased by 130% to 196% compared to 1953.

    In the past half-century—from 1903 when Zhan Tianyou designed and built the current Beijing-Baotou Railway to 1949—Chinese designers had rarely undertaken the design of larger industrial enterprises such as coal mines, power stations, and steel plants, except for some railway and transportation designs. However, from 1953 to October of this year, this young design team of over 100,000 people has independently designed nearly 400 industrial projects above the quota limit. These include mechanized mine shafts such as the Shuangyashan Lingxi vertical shaft, iron and steel and non-ferrous metal smelting enterprises, the Harbin Electric Machinery Plant and Heavy Machinery Plant, as well as many newly built textile factories in Zhengzhou, Shijiazhuang, and the Northwest, etc. All basic construction projects for railways, transportation, postal and telecommunications, water conservancy, and civil construction that have been or will be constructed during the First Five-Year Plan are designed by China. The seven large reservoirs, including Guanting, Meishan, and Foziling, were also designed by Chinese designers. In addition, Chinese designers have also assisted fraternal countries such as Korea and Vietnam, and friendly neighboring countries such as Burma and Cambodia, in designing some railways, textile factories, and other light industrial enterprises.

    In the process of completing these design tasks, especially in industrial design, the vast majority were designed using the most advanced technology under the guidance of Soviet experts. Now, some of China's designers have begun designing for the industrial construction of the Second Five-Year Plan.

    Designers have also made great achievements in improving design thinking. Due to timely criticism and reversal of design ideas that did not pay attention to economy and practicality, and simply pursued aesthetics, the design standards for non-productive construction were lowered. According to statistics from 3,280 larger construction units, savings of over 1 billion yuan were achieved last year. These funds are equivalent to the investment for constructing 28 textile factories with 100,000 spindles and 3,500 looms each. The industrial and civil buildings designed by designers are also more in line with the needs of production and people's lives. At the same time, because incorrect design ideas were criticized in a timely manner, design work in recent years has avoided serious and principled errors on a national scale. The number of standard designs used and the reuse of drawings have also increased year by year. In the first half of this year, the use of standard designs and the reuse of drawings in industrial design averaged 40%, and in civil construction, it averaged 70%. This saved 6 million workdays, equivalent to the work of 50,000 designers for five or six months. In the first half of this year, nearly two-thirds of the industrial design projects adopted two-stage design, which greatly shortened the design time for these projects.

    Although China's design personnel have increased significantly, and the speed and quality of design have improved significantly, design departments generally feel that there is still a shortage of technical personnel. Among the existing design personnel, engineering and technical personnel account for less than half; and the technical level of these technical personnel still requires arduous efforts and learning to meet the needs of the country; China cannot yet design many large-scale and technically complex enterprises. Even for those that can be designed, the speed and quality of design are still not fully adapted to construction requirements. To date, more than 10% of construction drawings nationwide cannot be delivered on time; and the phenomenon of design rework is still not isolated.

### 设计队伍增加到十万多人　设计机构已有一百多个  我国四年来独立设计了四百个大工业企业

    设计队伍增加到十万多人　设计机构已有一百多个
    我国四年来独立设计了四百个大工业企业
    据新华社讯　新华社记者李峰报道：据最近国家统计局统计，我国的设计队伍（包括为设计提供资料的勘测人员在内）已经增加到十万多人，并且已经建立起一百四十多个设计机构；其中属工业系统的有六十多个。工业系统的设计人员占全国设计人员50％左右，比1953年增加了110％；铁道、交通、邮电、水利和民用建筑等各系统的设计人员，比1953年增加了130％到196％。
    在过去的半个世纪——从1903年詹天佑设计和建筑现在的京包铁路到1949年，我国的设计人员除作过部分铁路、交通的设计以外，很少作过比较大的煤矿、电站和钢铁等工业企业的设计工作。可是从1953年到今年10月份，现在的这支十万多人的年轻的设计队伍，独立设计了近四百个限额以上的工业项目。其中有双鸭山岭西竖井等机械化矿井，钢铁和有色金属冶炼企业，哈尔滨电机厂和重型机械厂，以及郑州、石家庄和西北等地新建的许多纺织厂等；第一个五年计划已经建设或将要建设的铁道、交通、邮电、水利和民用建筑等基本建设，全部是我国设计的；官厅、梅山、佛子岭等七个大型水库，也是我国设计人员设计的。此外，我国设计人员还帮助朝鲜、越南等兄弟国家和缅甸、柬埔寨等友好邻邦，设计了一部分铁路、纺织厂，以及其它轻工业企业。
    在完成这些设计工作的过程中，特别是在工业设计中，绝大部分是在苏联专家指导下，采用最先进的技术设计起来的。现在，我国的设计人员，有些已开始为第二个五年计划的工业建设进行设计了。
    设计人员们在提高设计思想方面，也取得了很大成就。由于及时批判和扭转了不重视经济、适用，单纯追求美观等设计思想，降低了非生产性建设的设计标准。根据三千二百八十个较大的建设单位统计，去年节约资金达十亿多元。这些资金，相当于建设二十八个十万纱锭、三千五百台布机的纺织工厂的投资。设计人员所设计的工业和民用建筑，也更加符合于生产和人民生活的需要。同时，因为及时地批判了不正确的设计思想，使近年来的设计工作，避免了在全国范围内犯严重的和原则性的错误。使用标准设计和重复利用图纸的数量，也一年比一年增加。今年上半年，工业设计中使用标准设计和重复利用图纸的数量，平均达到40％，民用建筑平均达到70％。这样就节省了六百万个工作日，相当于五万设计人员做五、六个月的工作。今年上半年工业设计中，采用两段设计的项目将近三分之二，这样，就大大缩短了这些项目的设计时间。
    我国设计人员虽然增加了很多，设计的速度和质量有了显著的提高，但是设计部门仍然普遍感到技术人员不足。现有的设计人员中，工程技术人员还不到一半；而这些技术人员的技术水平，要赶上国家的需要，还得艰苦的努力和学习；许多大型的技术复杂的企业，我国还不能设计。能够设计的，设计的速度和质量也还不尽适应建设要求。到目前为止，全国仍有10％以上的施工图不能按期交出；设计返工的现象也还不是个别的。
