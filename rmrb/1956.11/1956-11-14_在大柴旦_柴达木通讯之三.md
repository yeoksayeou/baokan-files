    At Da Qaidam
    —Qaidam Correspondence, Part Three
    By Our Correspondent Gu Lei
    
    From Xining to Da Qaidam, seven hundred and sixty kilometers, the car traveled for less than three days, almost there, so fast! If it were last year, when the roads were very bad, it would have taken at least half a month, if not twenty days, and the car might have been ruined on the way. The closer we got to Da Qaidam, the faster the car ran, like a horse returning to its pasture. At this time, the driver, Old Qin, told me a joke that proved how desolate Da Qaidam used to be:
    “Last year, there wasn’t a soul in Da Qaidam. A few of us from Team 632 were going from Golmud to Lenghu. We passed through here, and it got dark. We set up our tents and stayed the night. There were plenty of wild animals then, and even though we said we weren't afraid, we were always a little uneasy. In the middle of the night, one comrade suddenly woke up and felt a small, furry thing crawl into his sleeve and up his arm. He couldn't stand it! He grabbed that thing and wouldn't let go, shouting loudly. His shouting woke everyone up, and they helped him take off his clothes to see what it was. He was still holding on tightly. Ha! Ha! It turned out to be a little mouse, which he had already squeezed to death. Hmm, that was really something. Now, it's completely different. Da Qaidam has houses and electric lights. It's hard to imagine something like that happening again! I've been away for several days now. I'm afraid I won't recognize it when I get back!”
    
    I was a bit skeptical about what Old Qin said. I know that every city in our country is changing all the time. From the frontier to the interior, the faces of many old cities are being renewed, and new cities are appearing in formerly desolate places. The face of Qaidam is changing, that's a fact. But it's only been a few months, can it really be flying?
    
    I entered Da Qaidam from the east at three o'clock in the afternoon, paying close attention to everything. At the entrance, there were a large number of mobile homes, tents, and piles of gasoline drums. On a patch of open ground, construction workers were building houses. A small generator was squatting in a small house, calling out non-stop. Around this house were many parked cars, which I later learned was a temporary car repair shop. Nearby, on the lawn and dirt field, stood basketball hoops. A wide road ran through the center of Da Qaidam, with cars constantly coming and going.
    
    The next day, I made a special effort to see the appearance of Da Qaidam. It's really strange, in this arid basin filled with yellow sand, nature has arranged a beautiful environment. Da Qaidam is sandwiched between two mountains stretching east and west. The remaining vein of the Qilian Mountains—Daban Dakeng Mountain—extends from west to east, like a huge arm stretching out to gently embrace this future city from the north. The highest peaks have already crossed the snow line, and the snow-capped peaks radiate a dazzling white light all year round, constantly giving people the feeling that "it's not dry here." In a small valley between the mountains, there is a hot spring, with two springs at the outlet, one hot, with a temperature of eighty-two degrees Celsius, and the other cold. People who come here to bathe can freely adjust the water temperature. Where the spring water flows down from steep cliffs, they can stand underneath and take a shower, or they can dig a pit in a low-lying area and lie inside, like a bathtub. Every Sunday, many people take a car or walk several kilometers to come here, sit in the warm water, lower their heads to wash away the dust, and raise their heads to admire the white snow. The scenery is exceptionally unique. To the south of Da Qaidam is a vast grassland that stretches as far as the eye can see. Wild grasses are as dense as felt, covering the earth, and large herds of camels roam freely on it. Lake Yigacaidam quietly lies in the middle of the grassland. The green lake water is like a shining green satin, and it looks particularly beautiful when the breeze shakes it. Large flocks of wild ducks roost by the lake, sometimes flying up, sometimes landing. Because this is a saltwater lake, there is now a ring of salt crystals around the lake, which looks like silver edges have been inlaid on the green lake water. When the sun shines obliquely, it emits strange brilliance from the lake. The small hills close to the south bank of the lake are low. The shaded side is dark grey, cutting off the view of those looking south, making the entire scene of Da Qaidam more compact!
    
    It is on this beautiful piece of land, on this piece of land that has been uninhabited for many years, that the construction of Da Qaidam has begun! From the easternmost building to the westernmost building, the distance is six or seven kilometers. More than three thousand construction workers are working busily along this line, completing eight hundred to one thousand square meters of construction tasks every day, and will complete seventy thousand square meters of construction by winter. The construction workers have put forward a slogan: "Let everyone who spends the winter here live in a house." The Qaidam Working Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Qaidam Working Committee of the People's Government of Qinghai Province have already started working here. The operations of the transportation company and the trade company, the post and telecommunications bureau, various people's banks, bookstores, and other systems are becoming increasingly active. One day, I went to several retail outlets of the trade company and saw a prosperous scene. People living here and passing through here bought various canned goods from Shanghai and Guangdong, Xinghua Village wine from Shanxi and Qingdao beer, embroidered satin quilt covers and pillows from Hunan Province, high-quality fruit candies and chocolate candies, domestic clocks and imported watches, various cotton knitwear, and a wide variety of stationery. Others crowded into the post and telecommunications bureau, using letters and telegrams to send money and greetings from afar to relatives and friends all over the country.
    
    From many people's conversations, I learned that all this has only happened recently. The history of this city is extremely simple. This used to be a paradise for wild horses and gazelles. Near the mountains, there are often traces of bears. In February of this year, only twelve people lived here. They were comrades from the camel farm who had come here to support geological prospecting work, driving camels to live here. In June, the first house was built here. Since then, desolation has been driven away. On my fourth day in Da Qaidam, I ate gazelle meat, wild horse meat, and valuable bear paws. These were hunted by the Kazakhs living here from very far away. Now, the city's population has increased to more than six thousand people, and most of them will spend the winter here. Whenever a day's work is over and the lights are turned on, many loudspeakers broadcast various kinds of music and operas. At this time, thinking back to the story that driver Old Qin told me on the road, it feels particularly exciting.
    
    However, this is not the true face of Da Qaidam. Think about it, why are the party and government leading bodies of Qaidam located here, why do the names of many service industries have the words "Qaidam Mining Area" in front of them, and why is the scale of urban construction expanding so quickly? All of this is telling people: Da Qaidam will be a new industrial city. The Party's policy of socialist industrialization has given it life, its birth was attended by all the geological prospectors working in Qaidam as midwives, and the rich mineral resources of the Qaidam Basin will nourish its growth.
    
    Open the geological map of the Qaidam Basin, and through the various colors and markings on the map, you can see the following outline: From Da Qaidam, the highway northwest, crossing the Yuka coal mine, leads directly to a large group of oil structures in the Lenghu area, where many drilling rigs are extending into the underground oil layers; from here, running due west along the highway, you can see the "Little Jiangnan of the Basin" - the Mahai Farm, you can meet a large number of geologists working hard on the oil structure, and crossing the basin to Mangai you can see the producing wellheads and rock salt mines; if you travel south by car to Golmud, you will be amazed by a magnificent non-ferrous metal mine, and when crossing the "Ten Thousand Zhang Salt Bridge" on the Charhan Salt Lake, you will be encouraged by the basin's salt reserves; on the road east to Xining, in addition to the famous Kek and Chaka Salt Lakes, you can also go to many oil structures and eat fresh vegetables produced by the Delingha Farm. Da Qaidam is the hub of the basin's road network, surrounded by many mineral resources, especially oil structures, which has determined that it must embark on the road of an industrial city, and will inevitably become the center of all activities in the basin. This is the real reason why the leading bodies here are already considering the future urban planning of Da Qaidam. They are not only considering where to locate future power plants and factories, but also planning how to bring the hot spring water down for bathing. They are also preparing to build a road directly to Lake Yigacaidam, and make some small boats to facilitate people to visit the lake. Greening work in the city will begin on a small scale next spring. Now, smoke is rising from the dozen or so brick kilns on the edge of the city, which is a sign that higher-level buildings will soon appear in Da Qaidam.
    
    The future picture of Da Qaidam moves and inspires many people, who are willing to work hard for this future city and settle down here. Yi Shun'gen, a twenty-five-year-old carpenter, came to Qinghai from Shanghai in 1951. In the first two years, he couldn't settle down and always thought about the city on the banks of the Huangpu River. The Qaidam Basin attracted him. He brought his lover from Shanghai to Xining and decided to take root, blossom, and bear fruit in Qinghai. Since then, he has been full of enthusiasm in his work and has improved many tools. In 1955, he gloriously joined the Communist Party of China. July 23rd of this year is a day he will never forget in his life. On this day, he set off to enter the basin, and his first child was only one day short of being a month old. Before leaving, he named his child "Wei Liang." His lover disagreed:
    
    "Don't call him that."
    "Why?" Yi Shun'gen asked.
    "It sounds so awful!"
    "Awful? Do you know what it means?"
    "No."
    "It means that I want to play a great bridging role in building Qinghai and Qaidam. Do you understand now!"
    
    Yi Shun'gen convinced his lover and used his child's name to encourage himself and a large number of construction workers to enter Da Qaidam. He is the carpentry captain of the construction engineering company. When building Da Qaidam, he and his partners always worked with all their hearts. Sixteen people can make fifty-seven door frames every day, which had never happened in Xining. He told others: "In the past, some people said that nothing grows in Qinghai, that's nonsense! Cities and factories can grow here. I'm going to live here for the rest of my life and become a Qinghai person. Don't believe it? Just watch, as soon as there are family dormitories, I'll bring my lover and child here."
    
    The words spoken by the young Yi Shun'gen today, far away from his hometown, are the words of thousands of people who have entered Qaidam, the words of the people who are building Da Qaidam and living here. In these words, there is so much joy and pleasure, hope and fantasy! Although everything here has just begun, and life is still difficult, people still live with great interest.
    
    One evening, the crescent moon hung diagonally in the sky, and the waters of Qaidam Lake shimmered, looking like one moon in the sky and one shadow in the lake. The dark mountains on both sides were like majestic guards, protecting the people here. In an open-air field, the dance party was about to begin. The electric lights were painted in various colors. The dusty ground was sprinkled with water to avoid raising dust. A comrade came to the dance floor holding a child who was less than one year old. Many people looked at this person who had settled down in Da Qaidam with envious eyes. Suddenly, the accordion rang out: People followed the beat tapped out by the big drum, and pairs of them went down to the dance floor. Some people wore leather coats, some wore short leather jackets, and most wore boots. The rhythm of the music became faster and faster, and everyone spun around to their heart's content. Soon, a cloud of dust rose from the ground, blurring people's faces, but everyone's enthusiasm never diminished. One dance after another passed, and after sprinkling water again, dust rose again… Late at night, everyone slowly dispersed, and soft songs drifted in the distance. Wasn't someone asking at this dance when the family dormitories would be built! It seems that this is just an interlude in the lives of the people of Da Qaidam, but it is the whole of their mood.
    
    On the way back, I walked and thought, but I couldn't imagine what Da Qaidam would be like this time next year! What would the even more pleasant lives of the people living in the city that will become the political, economic, and cultural center of the basin be like!

    在大柴旦
    ——柴达木通讯之三
    本报记者　顾雷
    从西宁到大柴旦，七百六十公里，汽车跑了不到三天，就快到了，真快。要是在去年道路很坏的时候，不走二十天，也得半个月，说不定汽车会被颠坏在路上。愈靠近大柴旦，汽车跑的愈快，像牧归时的马。这时，司机老秦给我讲了一个证明大柴旦过去荒凉的笑话：
    “去年，大柴旦连个人影都没有。我们632队的几个人，从噶尔穆去冷湖。路过这里时，天黑了。大伙搭起帐篷住下。那会，野物有的是，说是不害怕，心里还老是嘀咕。半夜里，一个同志一下子醒了，觉着有个小东西，浑身是毛，钻进了袖口，顺着胳臂往上爬。嗬！他沉不住气了，一把抓住那个东西死也不丢，大声叫唤。这一喊不要紧，把大伙吵了起来，帮他脱衣服，看是什么。这时，他还抓住那东西不松手哩。哈！哈！后来一看，是个小耗子，早被他捏死了。嗯，真有意思。现在，大不一样了，大柴旦有了房子、电灯，想再碰见这样的事难了！我出来好几天啦，回去怕不认识了呢！”
    我对老秦的话，有些半信半疑。我知道，我们国家的每一个城市时刻在变化，从边疆到内地，许多旧的城市的面貌变新了，原来荒凉的地方出现了新的城市。柴达木的面貌在改变是事实，但是毕竟只有几个月的时间，难道它在飞吗？
    我是下午三点钟从东面进入大柴旦的，很留心观看每一件事物。入口处有大批的活动房屋、帐篷、成堆的汽油筒。在一片空地上，建筑工人正在盖房子。一个小的发电机，蹲在一间小房子里，不停地叫唤。这间房子的周围，停了许多汽车，后来知道这是临时的汽车修理厂。附近的草坪和土场上，立着篮球架。宽阔的公路，由大柴旦中心穿过，往来的汽车不断。
    第二天，我特别抽时间看了大柴旦的外貌，真奇怪，在这到处都是黄沙而又干旱的盆地里，大自然竟给它安排了一个优美的环境。大柴旦，被夹在东西伸展着的两个山的中间。祁连山的余脉——大板大肯山，由西向东，像伸开的一支巨大的手臂，从北面轻轻地揽住这个未来的城市。山的最高峰已插过雪线，峰顶有大片积雪，一年四季放射出皑皑白光，时刻给人一种“这里并不干旱”的感觉。山间的一个小谷里，有一口温泉，出口处有两股泉水，一股是热的，温度是摄氏八十二度，另一股是冷的。来这里洗澡的人可以自由调节水温，遇到泉水从陡壁上流下，可以站在下面洗个淋浴，也可以在低洼处挖一个坑，躺在里边，宛如盆浴。每逢星期天，有不少人坐车或步行几公里到这里，坐进温水，低头洗尘垢、抬首赏白雪，景色异常别致。大柴旦的南面，是一片看不到尽头的草滩，野草密如毡片，盖住大地，大群的骆驼在上面自由地游荡。伊嘎柴达木湖，静静地躺在草地中间，碧绿的湖水像一块闪光的绿色缎子，当微风抖动它的时候，显得特别美丽。栖息湖边的大群野鸭，时而飞起，时而落下。因为这是个咸水湖，现在湖的四周已有一圈盐的结晶，看去像是给绿翠似的湖水镶上了银边，太阳斜射时，由湖中放出奇异的光彩。紧贴湖南岸的小山，矮矮的，背阴处是一片黛色，截住了向南望的人的视线，使整个大柴旦景色的画面更紧凑了！
    就在这块美好的地方，就在这块多少年来没有人烟的地方，大柴旦的城市建设开始了！从东面的一个建筑到最西面的一个建筑，距离有六、七公里，三千多个建筑工人正在这条线上忙碌着，每天完成八百到一千平方公尺的建筑任务，到冬天完成七万平方公尺建筑。建筑工人们提出了一个口号：“让每一个在这里过冬的人，都住上房子。”中共柴达木工作委员会、青海省人民委员会柴达木工作委员会、早已开始在这里办公。交通运输公司和贸易公司，邮电局、各人民银行、书店等各个系统的业务，正在日益地活跃起来。一天，我到贸易公司的几个门市部去，看到了一片繁荣的气象。住在这里和由这里经过的人，从这里买走了来自上海和广东的各种罐头、山西杏花村和青岛的美酒、湖南省的绣花缎子被面同枕头、上等的水果糖与巧克力糖、国产的钟和进口的手表、各色棉毛织品、多种多样的文具。另一些人，拥挤在邮电局里，用信、电报，给全国各地的亲人、朋友寄去钱和远方的问候。
    从许多人的谈话里，使我知道这一切都是才发生不久的事。这个城市的历史是极其简单的。这里原来是野马、黄羊的乐园。靠山边的地方，常有熊的足迹。今年2月，这里只住着十二个人，那是骆驼场里的同志，为了支援地质普查工作，赶着骆驼在这里住下了。6月间，这里盖起了第一幢房子。从此，荒凉被赶跑了。我到了大柴旦的第四天，曾吃到了黄羊肉、野马肉和名贵的熊掌。这是住在这里的哈萨克人，从很远的地方打来的。现在，城市人口增加到六千多人，有大部分人将在这里过冬。每当一天工作终了、电灯亮了的时候，许多支扩音器放送各种音乐和戏曲。这时再想一想司机老秦在路上给我讲的那个故事，就觉得特别令人兴奋。
    但是，这还不是大柴旦真正的面貌。想想看，为什么柴达木党的、政府的领导机关设在这里，为什么许多服务性行业的名称的前面加上“柴达木工矿区”的字样，为什么城市建设的规模扩展的这样快？这一切，在告诉人们：大柴旦将是一个新的工业城市。这个城市，是党的社会主义工业化方针给了它生命，它的诞生是由在柴达木工作的全体地质勘探人员充当助产士的，柴达木盆地丰富的矿藏会滋养它成长。
    打开柴达木盆地的地质图，通过图上的各种颜色和标记，可以看到这样一个梗概：从大柴旦向西北的公路，越过鱼卡煤矿，直通冷湖地区大群的石油构造，那里的许多台钻机正伸向地下的油层；由这里沿公路奔正西，可以看到“盆地的小江南”——马海农场，可以遇到大批的地质人员正紧张地在石油构造上工作，而横穿盆地到了芒崖可以看到出油的井口、岩盐矿；如果你乘车南行去噶尔穆，便会被一座雄伟的有色金属矿山惊住，在越过察尔汗盐湖上“万丈盐桥”的时候，会为盆地盐的储量而振奋；在东去通向西宁的路上，除了著名的柯柯、茶卡盐池以外，同样地可以走上许多个石油构造，并且吃到德令哈农场生产的新鲜蔬菜。大柴旦是盆地公路网的枢纽，它被许多矿藏特别是石油构造包围着，这就命定了它必须向工业城市这条路上开步走，必然会成为盆地一切活动的中心，这就是这里的领导机关已在考虑大柴旦未来城市规划的真正原因。他们不但考虑了未来的电厂、工厂设在什么地方，也在打算如何把温泉的水引下来供洗澡用。还准备修一条路，直通伊嘎柴达木湖，再做一些小船，便于人们游湖。城市的绿化工作，明年春天会小规模地开始。现在，城边的十几座砖窑上，已腾起了浓烟，这是大柴旦不久就要出现高一级建筑物的信号。
    大柴旦未来的图景，感动和鼓舞着许多人，他们愿为这个未来的城市努力工作，愿意在这里安家立业。二十五岁的木工益顺根，是1951年从上海到青海的。在开始的两年中，他一直不能安定下来，觉得青海啥也没有，时刻想念黄浦江边的城市。柴达木盆地把他吸引住了，他把爱人由上海接到了西宁，决心在青海生根、开花、结果。从此，他在工作中充满了热情，改进了许多工具，1955年光荣地参加了中国共产党。今年的7月23日，是他一生中永远难忘的日子。这天，他动身进盆地，而他的第一个孩子正差一天不满月。动身前，他给孩子起名叫“伟梁”，爱人不同意：
    “不叫这个。”
    “为什么？”益顺根问道。
    “多难听！”
    “难听？你知道这是什么意思？”
    “不知道。”
    “就是说，我要在建设青海、柴达木时起伟大的桥梁作用。知道了吧！”
    益顺根说服了自己的爱人，用孩子的名字勉励自己和大批建筑工人走进大柴旦。他是建筑工程公司的木工队长，在建设大柴旦的时候，他和他的伙伴们总是尽心尽力地工作，十六个人每天能做五十七个门框，这是在西宁时没有过的事。他给别人说：“过去有人说青海什么也不长，才是胡说呢？这里能长城市、长工厂。我在这里住一辈子啦，要成为青海人。不信啊？看着吧，一有家属宿舍，我就把爱人和孩子接来。”
    年青的益顺根在远离故乡的今日所说的话，正是千万个走进柴达木的人的心里话，是建设大柴旦和生活在这里的人们的心里话，在这句话里有多少欢乐和愉快、希望和幻想啊！尽管这里一切才刚刚开始，生活还是艰苦的，而人们仍然生活的很有风趣。
    一个晚上，月牙儿斜挂在天边，柴达木的湖水闪着微光，看去是天上一个月亮、湖里一个影子。两边黑黝黝的山，像一个雄赳赳的卫士，佑护着这里的人们。在一个露天的场子上，舞会就要开始了。电灯，被涂上各种颜色。多土的地上洒满了水，免得扬起尘土。一个同志，抱着一个不满周岁的孩子来到了舞场，许多人用羡慕的目光看这位在大柴旦安了家的人。突然，手风琴响起来了：人们随着大鼓点出的拍子，一对一对地走下场去。有的人穿着皮大衣，有的人穿短皮袄，脚上大都穿的靴子。音乐的节奏越来越快，大家尽情地旋转，不久，地上泛起了一片土雾，模糊了人的面孔，而每一个人的兴致却从没有减弱过。一场一场过去了，泼上水再跳，又扬起了尘土……夜深了，大家慢慢地散去，轻轻的歌声在远处流荡着。就在这个舞会上，不是有人打听什么时候盖家属宿舍吗！看来，这只是大柴旦人们生活中的插曲，然而却是心情的全部。
    回来的路上，我边走边想，但是总想不出明年今日的大柴旦会是个什么样子！生活在将成为盆地政治、经济、文化中心的城市中的人们，更愉快的生活又会是怎样的情景！
