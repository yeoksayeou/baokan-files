Taiwan Situation

    U.S. Military Vehicles Run Rampant, Causing Numerous Deaths and Injuries to Children and Women; Economic Power Gradually Falls into Foreign Hands; Commodity Prices Generally Rise

    U.S. military personnel stationed in Taiwan frequently cause traffic accidents. According to Taiwan newspapers, on November 11th, the first day of the so-called "Safe Driving Promotion Week" in Hsinchu County, Taiwan, an official from the U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group in Taiwan drove a motorcycle and sped recklessly through the streets of Hsinchu City, injuring a cyclist. On the same day, in Shihlin Township, Taipei City, a member of the U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group drove a car and injured Wu Ming-mao, a seven-year-old child.

    According to the "Highway Traffic Safety Promotion Committee" of Taiwan, a total of 1,320 traffic accidents occurred in Taiwan in the first half of this year, resulting in 1,518 casualties, including 156 deaths. Many of these serious traffic accidents were caused by U.S. military personnel stationed in Taiwan.

    According to Taipei reports published in Hong Kong newspapers, on the evening of November 18th, a U.S. Navy personnel drove a military vehicle recklessly in Taipei City, killing three Chinese women. Two died on the spot, and the other was seriously injured and died in a Taipei hospital.

    The United States is stepping up its seizure of the Chiang Kai-shek group's economic power, which has aroused dissatisfaction among Kuomintang personnel in Taiwan.

    Taiwan newspapers said: Not long ago, Chang Chiu-ju, a legislator of the Chiang Kai-shek group, raised "Eighty Questions of Concern about Finance and Economics" to the so-called "Executive Yuan," in which he angrily asked: Are the Chiang Kai-shek group's "financial and economic measures independent? Or are they controlled by others?" He also asked: "Do I utilize U.S. aid? Or does U.S. aid utilize me?"

    Recently, a Taiwan publication published an article that also criticized the United States for frequently coercing the Chiang Kai-shek group through "U.S. aid agencies" to "abandon its opinions or insistence that it should express," causing Taiwan, which accepts "U.S. aid," to "add countless unbelievable strange things." The article stated that although the "Economic Stabilization Committee" of Taiwan is nominally an agency under the Chiang Kai-shek group's "Executive Yuan," Americans must participate in every meeting of this committee and its sub-groups or panels. These Americans are nominally observers, but in reality, they control the real power of every economic measure. The author of the article said that if such an "Economic Stabilization Committee" controlled by the United States is necessary, then the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Ministry of Finance of the Chiang Kai-shek group should be abolished.

    The article also accused Wang Peng, the secretary-general of the "U.S. Aid Utilization Committee" of the Chiang Kai-shek group's "Executive Yuan," saying that Wang Peng once replied to an inquiry from the "Legislative Yuan" that he himself did not know whether he was an official of the Chiang Kai-shek group or an official of the United States.

    According to Taiwan newspaper reports, prices in Taiwan have continued to rise recently, with rice prices rising the most sharply. On November 10th, the wholesale price of each sixty kilograms of Taipei's Penglai white rice was 200 Taiwan dollars, but by November 15th, it had risen to 218 Taiwan dollars. In six days, the price of rice rose by 9%. The prices of oil, sugar, flour, cloth, medicines, and other commodities have also generally increased. (Xinhua News Agency)

### 台湾近况  美军汽车横冲直撞  儿童妇女大量死伤  经济权力渐落人手  商品价格普遍上涨

    台湾近况
    美军汽车横冲直撞  儿童妇女大量死伤  经济权力渐落人手  商品价格普遍上涨
    美国驻台湾军事人员经常制造车祸。据台湾报纸透露，11月11日在台湾新竹县开展所谓“安全行车宣传周”的第一天中，美国驻台湾军事援助顾问团的官员驾驶一辆摩托车，在新竹市街上乱开飞车，将一个骑自行车的市民撞伤。同一天，在台北市士林镇也有一个美国军事援助顾问团的人员，驾驶汽车将一个七岁的儿童吴明茂撞伤。
    据台湾“公路交通安全促进委员会”公布，今年上半年在台湾共发生车祸一千三百二十件，死伤居民一千五百十八人，其中死亡的就有一百五十六人。这些严重的车祸事件，有许多是驻台湾的美国军事人员造成的。
    据香港报纸刊载台北消息，一名美国海军人员11月18日晚上在台北市驾驶军车横冲直撞，辗死了三名中国妇女。两人当场毙命，另一人受重伤在台北医院死去。
    美国加紧攫夺蒋介石集团的经济权力，引起了台湾国民党人员的不满。
    台湾报纸说：不久前，蒋介石集团立法委员张九如向所谓“行政院”提出“忧念财经八十问”，其中就气愤地询问：蒋介石集团的“财经措施是独立自主的？还是受人支配的？”又问：“我运用美援？还是美援运用我？”
  　最近一家台湾刊物发表了一篇文章，也抨击美国在台湾通过“美援机构”，常常胁迫蒋介石集团“放弃了其应当表示的意见或坚持的主张”，使接受“美援”的台湾“平添了无数难以置信的怪事”。文章说，台湾的“经济安定委员会”名义上虽然是蒋介石集团“行政院”属下的机构，但这个委员会和它的每一个小组或分组开会，都必须有美国人参加，这些美国人名义上是观察员，但是实际上却操纵着每项经济措施的实权。文章作者说，如果这样由美国操纵的“经济安定委员会”有设立的必要，那末蒋介石集团的经济部和财政部都应该废止。
    这篇文章还指责蒋介石集团“行政院美援运用委员会”秘书长王蓬，说王蓬有一次答复“立法院”质询时，竟表示他自己也不知道究竟是蒋介石集团的官吏还是美国的官吏。
    据台湾报纸消息，台湾物价最近继续上涨，其中以米价的涨风最为猛烈。11月10日台北市蓬莱白米每六十公斤的批发价是二百元台币，到11月15日已经上涨为二百一十八元台币。在六天的时间内，米价上涨了9％。油、糖、面粉、布匹、药品和其他商品的价格也都普遍上涨。  （新华社讯）
