Xinhua News Agency Report:

    The Fengfeng Mining Area, famous for its production of coking coal, has abundant coal reserves in the surrounding areas. A general survey has proven that the coal reserves are about twice as large as previously estimated, and can be developed into a large-scale base for high-quality coking coal.
    The coal reserves in this area, in addition to being mostly prime coking coal, lean coal, fat coal, and fat-coking coal needed by the steel industry, also include anthracite with strong heating power for civilian use and lean coal for power generation, and the coal quality is very good. There are seven layers of coal that can be mined here. These coal seams are stable and concentrated underground, not far from the surface, and very convenient to mine. Generally, new mine shafts only need to be about 200 meters deep to extract the coal. In a small area around the Fengfeng Mining Area, proven reserves, calculated based on Fushun's annual output, can be mined for more than 100 years.

    峰峰矿区煤藏丰富
    据新华社讯　盛产炼焦煤著名的峰峰矿区的周围煤藏丰富。经过普查证明，煤的蕴藏量比过去人们推断的数字增加了一倍左右，可以连成一个规模巨大的高级炼焦煤基地。
    这一带地区蕴藏的煤，除了大部分是供应钢铁工业需用的主焦煤、瘦煤、肥煤和肥焦煤以外，还有供民用燃烧的火力很强的无烟煤和供动力燃烧的贫煤，煤质很好。这里可以开采的煤有七层，这些煤层在地下生成情况稳定、集中，离地表不深，开采很方便。一般新建矿井深度只在二百公尺上下，就能把煤开采出来。在峰峰矿区周围的一小块地方，经过探明，储量以抚顺年产量计算，可开采一百多年。
