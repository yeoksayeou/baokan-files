    The Old Man Who Built an Orchard on the Barren Hill
    Su Nong Wang Gexing Ji Le
    In Xiandu Mountain, one of the famous scenic spots in Zhejiang, there are many places of interest and historic sites, among which the towering "Stone Bamboo Shoot" is the most famous. Today, tourists who come to Xiandu Mountain first want to see not the Stone Bamboo Shoot, but an orchard west of the village, opposite the Stone Bamboo Shoot. People also want to see with their own eyes the owner of the orchard, Liu Qiwen – the conqueror of the barren hills.

    This orchard is different from ordinary orchards, it was built on a barren hill full of rocks. Forty years ago, Dianhou Mountain (the local name of the orchard) was like any other barren hill, full of rocks, and any occasional vegetation that grew could not thrive. It was only through Liu Qiwen's forty years of arduous, diligent, and creative labor that it became the orchard it is today.

    Currently, the orchard has an area of only about three mu (approximately 0.5 acres). There are more than ten kinds of fruit trees in the garden, including peaches, white bayberries, Xianju bayberries, crabapples, plums, apricots, plums, citrus, grapes, pomelos, snow pears, and persimmons. There are seven varieties of peaches alone, including flat peaches, honey peaches, and white blossom peaches. It can produce 3,000 pounds of fruit every year, and the quality is very good. These excellent fruit trees do not grow in fertile soil, but in rock cavities (indentations in large rocks, containing a small amount of soil) or gravelly soil. The barren hills that people once thought could not be conquered have become a beautiful orchard where flowers bloom and abundant fruits ripen all year round.

    Liu Qiwen is an old man with gray hair, sixty-nine years old. When he was twenty-one years old, he determined his ambition: to plant fruit trees on all barren land and hills, so that every family has fruit trees and everyone eats fruit. He is willing to dedicate his life to the country's horticulture.

    Once, a neighbor's shepherd boy brought Liu Qiwen some delicious peaches from Chicken Head Rock, more than ten meters high nearby. According to his analysis: this peach tree grew from seeds that a monkey had stolen and eaten, then discarded in a rock cavity. The "monkey peach" gave Liu Qiwen great inspiration. He saw with his own eyes that such good peaches could grow on this "Chicken Head Rock" where no vegetation could grow. So, couldn't peach trees and other fruit trees grow in other barren hill rock cavities? Later, he also saw a lush plum tree, about five meters high, growing on a cliff thirty meters high behind the Stone Bamboo Shoot, bearing many plums every year. The fact that these excellent plums and peaches could grow on the abandoned cliff rock cavities further strengthened Liu Qiwen's confidence in turning the barren hills into orchards.

    In 1923, he first carried out local reclamation on the mountain, planting oil-tea trees and tea trees. Because of his careful management, they survived. In the spring of 1924, he loosened the soil in the rock cavities and planted peach trees. Under his dedicated cultivation and management, most of the peach trees withstood the test of the hot sun and drought, and grew vigorously on this barren hill. In the spring of 1927, these peach trees bloomed with beautiful flowers; in summer, they bore their first fruits. He recalled: "When I saw the first flower bloom, it was like a mother giving birth to her first child. The desire to turn the barren hill into an orchard was about to be realized. How happy I was!" After that, he continued to plant more than ten kinds of fruit trees such as bayberries, citrus, crabapples, pears, and persimmons on the barren hill. This barren hill finally became a beautiful orchard.

    The process of turning the barren hill into an orchard was not smooth sailing. When he first started experimenting with planting fruit trees on the mountain, some people ridiculed him as a "madman." Some people even cut down his fruit trees. Before the fruits were ripe, shepherd boys would come to pick them; if they couldn't pick them, they would cut them down. In this way, preserving the seeds became extremely difficult. For the sake of continuing his cause, Liu Qiwen adopted the method of patient persuasion, and distributed 40% of the income to the villagers, asking everyone to protect the orchard together.

    However, some people still came to destroy it. At the same time, there was no income in the first few years, and his life was very difficult. He had to reduce his standard of living to the lowest level. Even this could not be sustained, so he had to borrow from others, and sell the meager family property; finally, he even sold a pair of ancestral silver chopsticks. Once, someone pulled out a wooden sign inserted in the garden (which read "Qiaoshan Botanical Experiment Site"). He retrieved the wooden sign, wrote a poem, and re-inserted it:

      Qiaoshan is not useless, mountain caves have wonderful treasures.
      Planting flowers, grasses, and trees, the land is rich for ten thousand families in spring.
      Trial and error proves effective, verification reveals the truth.
      The scene is not grand, but I regret the lack of understanding.

    Ridicule, attacks, destruction, and life's difficulties were all things that Liu Qiwen could overcome, because he had a heart to seek happiness for the people; as long as this sincere heart was beating, there would be strength to overcome any difficulty.

    After more than ten years of experimentation, Dianhou Mountain finally became an orchard. However, the first batch of fruit trees on the mountain were all local varieties or wild species, and the fruits they produced had low yields and poor quality. He then concentrated his efforts on improving the quality of the fruit trees.

    In 1935, he began to conduct fruit tree grafting experiments. He grafted honey peaches onto wild peaches. The first time, due to lack of experience, the survival rate was only 10%. But he did not lose heart. He found that the main reason for the failure to graft was that the bark layers were not tightly connected. He improved the method the following year, and the survival rate reached 30%. In the third year, he had basically mastered the grafting technique. At the same time, he strengthened management, and the survival rate increased to 85%. After that, he braved wind and rain to go to Changshanzhai, more than fifty miles away, to get the excellent bayberry variety "Xianju Bayberry," and climbed Ma'anshan, more than two thousand meters above sea level, to get the peach varieties "Honey Peach" and "Flat Peach,"... to carry out various fruit tree grafting. After a few years, the poor-quality fruit trees had all become good fruit trees.

    While grafting, he firmly grasped the principle of adapting to local conditions and carried out a series of works. He found that peach, bayberry, and other fruit trees had alternate bearing phenomena (that is, bearing fruit every other year). After long-term observation and research, he learned that alternate bearing was due to the barren soil and insufficient fertilizer in the orchard. He adopted the method of plowing the soil once a year and fertilizing twice, which met the needs of fruit tree growth and development, eliminating the phenomenon of alternate bearing, and obtaining a bumper harvest every year. He also regularly carried out pruning, flower thinning, and pest and disease control, so his orchard was always lush and green.

    Through more than thirty years of grafting experiments and research, he has accumulated rich experience. At present, his grafting survival rate is over 95%, and nearby farmers ask him to graft trees.

    Liu Qiwen also boldly carried out other experiments. He grafted scions of different varieties onto the same rootstock, so that a peach tree could have both flat peaches and honey peaches, a pear tree could have both snow pears and Xiao pears, and pears could be grafted onto crabapple trees. These experiments have all been successful. His experiment with bayberry cuttings was also successful, which created favorable conditions for large-scale propagation.

    In the old society, people like Liu Qiwen, who dedicated their youth to conquering barren hills, would never be cared for or helped. The old society gave him ridicule, sarcasm, attacks, and even the destruction of his fruit trees. Therefore, although he spent a lot of effort, the progress of his cause was very slow.

    In 1949, Jinyun was liberated, bringing warmth to this old man.

    After the Jinyun County Committee of the Communist Party of China learned about Liu Qiwen's deeds, it instructed the local party branch to protect his orchard. At a mass meeting, it was announced: "Liu Qiwen's orchard is the fruit of his forty years of labor, and no one shall infringe upon it." The county committee invited him several times to introduce his experience in training classes of hundreds of people, and pointed out that he had set an example for the whole county in conquering barren hills. This old man, who was ignored in the old society, received such care after liberation. How could he not be grateful and happy? He said: "The Party attaches such importance to my cause, not only protecting the orchard, but also promoting the experience throughout the county. This is something I never dreamed of. Now I have to work harder." The white-haired old man still works tirelessly in the orchard.

    Throughout the year, many people come to visit and learn from Liu Qiwen's experience. Liu Qiwen introduces his experience to them in detail and enthusiastically gives them excellent seedlings. In the past two years, about two thousand people have come to visit, and more than one thousand excellent seedlings of honey peaches, crabapples, and snow pears have been given out. These seedlings are distributed across the motherland, and in the near future, they will also bear abundant fruits.

    This year, Liu Qiwen joined the advanced cooperative. In the old man's sixty-nine years of life, this is a year different from any other year in the past. He is even more full of hope for the future. He said: "The Party's call to green the motherland has struck my heart. My ideal will be realized faster. Now I am truly living younger and working harder! Although I am sixty-nine years old this year, I want to contribute everything I have, all my old strength, to our cooperative and to our socialist cause."

    In order to turn the rocky creek beaches into orchards, prevent flood disasters, and benefit the people, he is making new efforts to transform the barren beaches. We believe that soon what will be presented to people here will no longer be barren creek beaches, but orchards. (Picture attached)

    在荒山上建设果园的老人
    苏农　汪葛兴　纪乐
    在浙江有名风景区之一——仙都山，有许多名胜和古迹，其中以高耸的“石笋”最有名。今天，来仙都山的游客先要看的却不是石笋，而是村西与石笋相对的一个果园。人们还要亲眼看看果园的主人刘奇温——荒山的征服者。
    这个果园与一般的果园不同，它是在岩石累累的荒山上建立起来的。四十年前的殿后山（果园土名），同一般荒山一样，满山是石头，偶尔生一些草木也是长不大的。经过刘奇温四十多年艰苦辛勤的有创造性的劳动才变成了今天的果园。
    目前果园的面积只有三亩左右，园内已有桃、白杨梅、仙居杨梅、花红、梅、杏、李、柑桔、葡萄、柚、雪梨、柿等十多种果树。单是桃的品种就有蟠桃、水蜜桃、白花桃等七种。每年可产水果三十担，而且品质都很好。这些优良的果树不是长在肥壤沃土里，而是长在石穴（大片岩石凹入处，内有少量泥土）或石砾土上。过去人们认为无法征服的荒山，变成了一年四季盛开鲜花结满丰盈果实的美丽的果园。
    刘奇温是一个头发斑白年已六十九岁的老人。在他二十一岁的时候就确定了自己的志愿：让所有的荒地荒山都种上果树，让家家有果树，人人吃水果。他愿将毕生精力献给祖国的园艺事业。
    有一次邻居放羊的孩子从附近三丈多高的鸡头岩上为刘奇温带来了几颗美味的桃子。根据他的分析：这株桃是猴子偷桃吃后将种子丢在石穴里长起来的。“猴桃”给了刘奇温很大的启示。他亲眼看到在这草木不生的“鸡头岩”上竟能长出这样好的桃来，那么另外的荒山石穴难道就不能长出桃和其他果树来吗？以后他又看到在石笋后三十丈高的悬崖上长着一株枝叶繁茂高约一丈五尺的梅树，每年能结很多的梅子。在这无人管理的悬崖石穴上都能长出这些优良的梅子和桃子，更增长了刘奇温把荒山变成果园的信心。
    1923年，他先在山上进行局部开垦，种上了油茶树和茶树。由于他细心管理，栽活了。1924年春，他又将石穴里的土挖松，种上了桃树。在他专心地培育和管理下，绝大部分桃树都经得起炎日和干旱的考验，茁壮地生长在这荒山上。1927年春天，这批桃树吐出了美丽的花朵；夏季，结下了第一次果实。他回忆起来说：“当我看到第一朵花开放的时候，就像母亲生下了第一个孩子一样，荒山变成果园的愿望将要实现了，心里该有多高兴啊！”此后，他继续将杨梅、柑桔、花红、梨、柿等十多种果树种到荒山上。这块荒山终于变成了美丽的果园。
    变荒山为果园的过程并不是一帆风顺的。在开始试验果树上山的时候，有人讽刺他是“疯子”。有人还把他的果树砍了。在果实未成熟的时候，牧童就来摘；摘不到就砍。这样，保留种子就成了极大的困难。刘奇温为了事业的继续，采取了耐心说服的方法，并且把收入的40％分给村人，要求大家共同保护。
    可是，仍然有人来破坏。同时，最初几年没有收入，他的生活十分困难，只得将生活水平降低到最低限度。这样的生活也还不能维持，就向人求借，还把家里微少的家产变卖；最后，把一双祖传的银筷子也卖了。一次，有人把园内插的一块木牌（上写“硗山植物试验场所”）拔掉了。他找回木牌，写了一首诗再插上：
      硗山非无用，山窟有奇珍。
      植成花草木，物阜万家春。
      试过知有效，验得始见真。
      场面虽不大，所恨少知音。
    讽刺，打击，破坏，生活上的困难，对刘奇温来说都是可以克服的，因为他有一颗为人民谋幸福的心；只要这颗赤诚的心在跳动，就有力量克服任何困难。
    经过十多年的试验，殿后山终于变成了果园。但是，第一批上山的果树都是当地土种或野生种，所结的果实产量低，品质很差。他就集中力量来提高果树品质。
    1935年，他开始进行果树嫁接试验。他把水蜜桃接在毛桃上，第一次由于缺乏经验，成活率仅10％。但他没有灰心，找出了接不活的主要原因是皮层与皮层没有密接，第二年改进了方法，结果成活率达到30％。第三年他已经基本上掌握了嫁接技术，同时加强了管理，成活率提高到85％。此后，他冒着风雨到五十多里路的长山寨去取来了杨梅良种“仙居杨梅”，爬上了海拔二千多公尺的马鞍山取来了桃良种“水蜜桃”和“蟠桃”的枝条，……进行各种果树嫁接。过了几年，品质不良的果树都变成了良好的果树。
    在进行嫁接的同时，他紧紧地掌握了因地制宜的原则，进行了一系列的工作。他发现桃、杨梅等果树有大小年现象（即隔年结果），经长期观察、研究后，知道隔年结果是由于园地土质瘠薄、肥料不足。他采用了一年铲土一次施肥两次的符合果树生长发育需要的办法，消除了隔年结果的现象，年年获得丰收。他还经常进行整枝、摘花、消灭病虫害等工作，因此他的果园里，永远是绿葱葱的。
    通过三十多年的嫁接实验研究，他积累了丰富的经验。目前，他的嫁接成活率在95％以上，附近的农民都请他去接树。
    刘奇温还大胆地进行了其他试验。他把不同品种的接穗接在同一株砧木上，在一株桃上有蟠桃和水蜜桃，一株梨上有雪梨和肖梨，梨接在花红树上，这些试验都已成功。他试验杨梅扦插也成功了，这样就为大面积繁殖创造了有利条件。
    在旧社会里，像刘奇温这样为了征服荒山而献出自己的青春的人，是绝不会有人去理睬帮助他的。旧社会给他的是讥笑、讽刺、打击，甚至摧残他的果树。因此，他虽然花了很多精力，事业的进展却很缓慢。
    1949年缙云解放了，给这位老人带来了温暖。
    中共缙云县委了解刘奇温的事迹以后，就责成当地党支部保护他的果园。在群众大会上宣布：“刘奇温的果园是他四十年来的劳动果实，任何人不得侵犯。”县委几次请他在数百人的训练班上介绍经验，并且指出他为全县征服荒山树立了榜样。这个在旧社会里没人理睬的老人，解放后受到这样的关怀，叫他怎能不感激高兴呢？他说：“党对我的事业这样重视，不仅保护果园，而且还把经验推广到全县，这是我所梦想不到的事。现在要更努力干了。”白发苍苍的老人，仍然经常在果园里不息地工作着。
    一年四季，都有不少人前来参观访问，学习刘奇温的经验。刘奇温详细地把自己的经验介绍给他们，热心地把优良的苗木赠送给他们。两年来，前来参观的约有二千多人，送出水蜜桃、花红、雪梨等优良树苗一千多株。这些树苗分布在祖国大地上，不久的将来就也会结出丰盈的果实来。
    今年，刘奇温参加了高级社。在老人六十九年的生活当中，这是不同于过去任何一年的一年。他对未来的生活更充满了希望。他说：“党关于绿化祖国的号召说中了我的心。我的理想要更快地实现了。现在真是越活越年轻，越干越起劲了！我今年虽然六十九岁了，但是我要将我的一切，我的全部老劲贡献给我们的合作社，贡献给我们的社会主义事业。”
    为了使石头累累的溪滩也变成果园，防止洪水的灾害，给人民造福，他正在作着改造荒滩的新的努力。我们相信，不久后在这里展现在人们眼前的将不再是荒凉的溪滩，而将是成片的果园。（附图片）
    在好溪西岸，刘奇温向参观者介绍他培植的防护林。
