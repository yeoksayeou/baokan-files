    God and Devil
    Shu Wu

    I just heard on the radio that the world-renowned peace fighter, the Dean of Canterbury from Britain, Hewlett Johnson, issued a righteous statement opposing the comparison of the Soviet army's assistance to the Hungarian Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government in suppressing the counter-revolutionary riots with the British and French invasion of Egypt, and confusing the two. He pointed out a very simple difference: the Soviet army's actions were at the invitation of the Hungarian government; while the British and French invading forces were not invited by the Egyptian government. He said it very well: if the counter-revolutionary restoration conspiracy had succeeded in Hungary, the country would have been dragged back onto the path of fascism.

    What naturally comes to mind is the Hungarian traitor, Cardinal Mindszenty. He had previously been sentenced to life imprisonment for treason, was released during this riot, and immediately became the leader of the riot, raising the green, white, and red flag with the archbishop's cross, in a majestic and murderous manner, to "triumphantly march" into Budapest. On the 3rd of this month, he was still using the radio station to call for the cancellation of socialism and the restoration of capitalism and church privileges, and on the 4th he went to the American embassy in Hungary to "seek refuge."

    I am not very clear about the hierarchy in the church, but it seems I have heard that a cardinal has a higher status than a general bishop. But in any case, Hewlett Johnson and Mindszenty cannot be compared, just as the great Soviet army and the British and French invading forces cannot be compared. The difference between them is like day and night.

    Hewlett Johnson, a righteous religious figure of the twentieth century, his social activities over the years have demonstrated peace, justice, conscience, bravery, and the struggle against evil and injustice. His image appears before the people of the world, always on the podium of the World Peace Congress.

    And Mindszenty, everyone has clearly seen this time, as soon as he comes out, he is a traitor who has already been sentenced to life imprisonment by the people, and immediately uses the blood of Hungarian revolutionaries and the people to dye his red robe, shining in the flames of burning Hungarian people's property, and being surrounded by mobs, bandits, hooligans, and thieves. I believe that all honest religious believers in the world will be indignant at his desecration of the name of religion. I suggest that if a religious painter wants to paint a devil, there could be no better model than him.

    In our world, right and wrong, good and evil, are as clear as black and white in the eyes of discerning people. The struggle between God and the Devil is not in heaven, but in this mortal world. Although the changes in the world are too rapid, some well-meaning people with poor eyesight may inevitably be confused at times. Even the current events in Hungary inevitably cause some people to misunderstand temporarily. However, as long as you look at which side the devils are standing on, who they oppose, and who opposes them, it can be understood without much explanation.

    神和魔
    舒芜
    刚刚从广播里听到，世界知名的和平战士、英国坎特伯雷教长约翰逊，发表了正义的声明，反对把苏军协助匈牙利工农革命政府镇压反革命暴乱的事，同英、法侵略埃及相提并论，混为一谈。他指出一个非常浅显的区别：苏军的行动，是应匈牙利政府之请；而英、法侵略军却不是埃及政府请去的。他说得非常好：如果反革命复辟阴谋在匈牙利得逞，这个国家便要被拉回法西斯的道路。
    令人自然联想起来的，是匈牙利的叛国罪犯，红衣主教明曾蒂。他先前因叛国罪被判处了无期徒刑，在这次暴乱当中被释放出来，立即成为暴乱的魁首，高张起大主教十字架的绿白红旗帜，威风凛凛、杀气腾腾，向布达佩斯“凯旋进军”。本月3日他还在广播电台号召取消社会主义，恢复资本主义和教会特权，在4日就到美国驻匈牙利公使馆“避难”去了。
    我不大清楚教会里的等级制度，似乎听说过，红衣主教比一般的主教地位要高些。但无论怎样，约翰逊和明曾蒂之不能相提并论，恰也正像伟大的苏军和英、法侵略军之不能相提并论一样。它们之间的区别就像白天和黑夜一样。
    约翰逊，一个二十世纪的正直的宗教家，他这些年来的社会活动，表现出和平，正义，良心，勇敢，对邪恶不义的斗争。他的形象出现在世界人民眼前，总是在世界和平大会的讲坛上。
    而明曾蒂，这次大家都清清楚楚地看见了，他一站出来，就是一个早被人民判处无期徒刑的叛国罪犯，而且立刻用了匈牙利革命者和人民的血加染他的红衣，闪耀在焚烧匈牙利人民财产的火光中，被簇拥在暴徒、盗匪、流氓、小偷的群里。我相信，全世界正直的教徒，都会愤慨他玷辱了宗教的名号。我建议，倘有宗教画家要画魔鬼，拿他来做模特儿，再好不过了。
    在我们的世界上，邪正是非，在明眼人看来，都像黑和白那么分明。神和魔的斗争，不在天国，而是在这个尘世。虽然世变太急，某些好心而眼睛欠亮的人，有时难免朦胧，即如目前匈牙利的事件，便难免引起一部分人暂时的不了解。但是，只要看一看魔鬼们所站的是那一边，他们反对谁，谁反对他们，也可以不烦言而喻了。
