    Also participating in the talks were, on the Soviet side, member of the CPSU Central Committee and Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Patolichev and Soviet Ambassador to Poland Ponomarenko, and on the Polish side, members of the Central Committee of the United Workers’ Party, Siell and Wierna, among others.

    During the talks, the two sides exchanged views on the relations between the Soviet Union and Poland and other issues related to the two countries. The talks were open, sincere, and friendly, filled with an atmosphere of sincerity and mutual understanding.

    The talks will continue later.

    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow (TASS): The leaders of the Polish United Workers' Party and the state, Gomulka, Zawadzki, Cyrankiewicz, and Jędrychowski, who are currently visiting the Soviet Union, met with the leaders of the Soviet Communist Party and the state, Khrushchev, Voroshilov, and Bulganin, on the 15th.

    Soviet Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Patolichev and Soviet Ambassador to Poland Ponomarenko were also present at the meeting.

    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow (TASS): The head of the delegation of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party and the Polish government, Gomulka, made a statement upon arriving in Moscow on the 15th.

    He said that the Polish United Workers' Party and the Polish government entrusted us to resume talks with the leaders of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government, which began last month in Warsaw as negotiations between the parties.

    Our party and the Polish people, loyal to the idea of ​​maintaining fraternal cooperation with the peoples of the Soviet Union, attach great importance to this meeting and its political and economic results. The Polish-Soviet alliance, forged in the common struggle and solidified by the blood shed together in the war against Nazi aggressors, best and most reliably ensures the inviolability and security of our country's Oder-Neisse border. Therefore, for our country, nothing is more important than the fraternal and friendly alliance with its great eastern neighbor, the Soviet Union. The Leninist principles of equality between large and small countries, respect for each other's sovereignty and national independence, and mutually beneficial cooperation are the soundest foundations for establishing such relations.

    Gomulka said that we are deeply convinced that the results of our talks will strengthen and expand the friendly, allied, and cooperative relations between Poland and the Soviet Union, consolidate the unity of the socialist family and strengthen their power, and promote the cause of world peace and the co-existence of peoples and countries with different social systems, without subjecting the lives of any people in the world to the devastation of war.
