    Huangshan Pine
    Dan Hui
    Who can split open the cliffs and precipices,
    Who can climb the ten-thousand-zhang peaks,
    Why are pine trees planted all over the sea of clouds,
    Seeming like giant eagles' wings covering the sky.
    Year after year, blizzards roll in the mountains,
    Storming the ridges wave upon wave,
    Look at the pine, its roots firmly planted on sharp rocks,
    Always standing tall at the peak with its head held high.
    I cannot find any trace of its hard struggles,
    Its verdant, long branches are so young,
    At night, stars fill the treetops,
    I love most to hear it sing in the wind.
    Like waves rolling in the sky,
    For hundreds of miles, Huangshan echoes with myriad sounds,
    Although I am not a singer,
    I will also pluck the strings and sing with it until dawn.

    黄山苍松
    丹辉
    谁能劈开悬崖绝壁，
    谁能攀上万丈高峰，
    为什么云海上栽遍松树，
    好似巨鹰的翅膀遮住天空。
    年年山中卷起暴风雪，
    一阵又一阵猛袭山岭，
    你看苍松脚踏锋利的岩石，
    总是仰着头立在峰顶。
    我寻不见它苦战的痕迹，
    那碧翠的长枝是这样年轻，
    夜来星星落满树梢，
    我最爱听它迎风长鸣。
    好似天上浪涛滚滚，
    几百里黄山响着万种声音，
    我虽然不是歌手，
    我也要拨动琴弦伴它唱到天明。
