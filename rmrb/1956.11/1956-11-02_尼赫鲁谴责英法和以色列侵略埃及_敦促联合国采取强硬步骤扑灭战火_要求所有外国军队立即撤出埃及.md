Xinhua News Agency, New York, November 1st: Indian Prime Minister Nehru wrote to UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld on October 31, requesting the UN to take "strong steps to prevent the world from falling into war, and to demand the immediate withdrawal of all foreign troops from Egypt." He also condemned the Anglo-French and Israeli aggression against Egypt.

Nehru's letter said: "We are deeply shocked by the recent developments in the Middle East situation, especially the Anglo-French action of invading Egypt after refusing to accept the US-proposed Security Council proposal. It is clear and universally recognized that Israel has carried out a large-scale aggression against Egypt. Instead of trying to stop this aggression, Britain and France are themselves invading Egyptian territory. This is not only a blatant offense against the Security Council and a violation of the UN Charter, but also has the potential to bring the most serious consequences to the world.

"Egypt, already suffering from Israeli aggression, is also painfully suffering from the Anglo-French invasion of its territory. The argument that this invasion is to protect the Suez Canal and ensure freedom of navigation is unfounded, because the first result of this invasion is the cessation of shipping.

"In view of the unfortunate consequences of this invasion of Egyptian territory, I urgently expect the United Nations to take strong steps on this issue to prevent the world from falling into war, and to demand the immediate withdrawal of all foreign troops from Egypt. The UN's handling must be faster than the acts of invasion and aggression.

"In issuing this letter, I am not only reflecting the unanimous opinion of my government and people, but also, I believe, the opinion of many people in other countries."

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, October 31st: According to the Indian Press Trust, Prime Minister Nehru received the French, American, Soviet, Egyptian, and Ceylonese diplomatic envoys to India this afternoon at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Nehru told them that the Indian government believes that Israel's aggression against Egypt and the reported Anglo-French invasion of Egypt is a "flagrant violation" of the UN Charter and is against all Bandung Principles.

    尼赫鲁谴责英法和以色列侵略埃及
    敦促联合国采取强硬步骤扑灭战火
    要求所有外国军队立即撤出埃及
    新华社1日讯　纽约消息：印度总理尼赫鲁10月31日写信给联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德，要求联合国采取“强硬步骤以防止全世界陷入战争，并且要求所有外国军队立即撤出埃及”。他还谴责英法和以色列侵略埃及。
    尼赫鲁的信说：“我们对最近的中东形势的发展，特别是英法在拒绝接受美国提出的安全理事会提案以后进犯埃及的行动，深感震惊。十分清楚而且公认的是，以色列已经对埃及进行了大规模的侵略。英法两国不是去设法制止这种侵略，而是自己也在进犯埃及的领土。这不仅是公然冒犯安全理事会和破坏联合国宪章的行为，而且还有可能带给全世界以最严重不过的后果。
    “已然遭受到以色列侵略的埃及还要痛苦地遭受英法对它的领土的进犯。认为这次进犯是为了保护苏伊士运河和保证自由通航的论据是毫无根据的，因为这次进犯的第一个结果是使航运停止了。
    “鉴于这次进犯埃及领土的不幸的后果，我迫切期望联合国在这个问题上采取强硬步骤以防止全世界陷入战争，并且要求所有外国军队立即撤出埃及。联合国的处理必须比进犯和侵略行动更为迅速。
    “在发出这封信的时候，我不仅反映了我的政府和人民的一致意见，而且，我相信，也反映了其他国家的许多人民的意见。”
    新华社新德里31日电　据印度报业托辣斯报道，尼赫鲁总理今天下午在外交部接见了法国、美国、苏联、埃及和锡兰驻印度的外交使节。尼赫鲁向他们表示：印度政府认为，以色列对埃及的侵略和所传英法对埃及的入侵是对联合国宪章的“彰明昭著的违反”，并且是反对一切万隆原则的。
