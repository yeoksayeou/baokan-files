Xinhua News Agency, Prague, November 27th: According to a report by the Czechoslovak News Agency on the 25th, the Hungarian People's Republic Revolutionary Worker-Peasant Government issued an appeal to farmers.

The appeal to farmers severely criticized the mistakes made in agricultural policy in past years and pointed out that the government believes that helping to develop agriculture is the government's basic task. The government will guarantee agricultural production and the material interests of farmers, and will also support individual farmers who increase yields per unit area and improve crop quality, while stopping any exploitative behavior. The government will also support cooperatives that are voluntarily established and maintained.

The appeal to farmers stated that the most important task in the country at present is to ensure law and order and discipline. The interests of the country at present require the working people in agriculture to complete agricultural work as quickly as possible, smoothly supply cities and industrial centers with food, and thus ensure that peaceful production and the production of industrial enterprises are not hindered as soon as possible.
