    A Suggestion on Overcoming Bureaucracy
    Zhou Zhengzhong
    In the current situation where bureaucracy is seriously present in some of our organizations, it is necessary to expose and criticize bureaucracy. However, I believe it is more important to take action. Only by putting forward concrete measures and methods can we effectively overcome bureaucracy in the organizations.

    Based on the experience of the Ministry of Foreign Trade over the past year, I believe that one of the methods to overcome bureaucracy is for the secretarial departments of organizations to implement the practice of rejecting unnecessary documents. In the summer of 1955, while holding an exhibition on bureaucracy, the Ministry of Foreign Trade proposed that secretarial departments should reject unnecessary incoming and outgoing documents. Rejection means that the secretarial department should review the outgoing documents of the organization, and return those that are unnecessary or those that have unnecessary copies; it should also review the incoming documents of the organization, and return those that are unnecessary to be sent to the organization or are not closely related to the organization to the original issuing organization after certain review procedures, stating the reasons for the return. In the past six months or so, we have rejected more than 1,000 documents in just a portion of the incoming and outgoing documents. Some people may think that rejecting so many documents may have had a negative impact on the work, right? No, there was no negative impact. None of the units whose documents we rejected have raised any objections or criticisms so far. On the contrary, both within the organization and in some lower-level units, it is reflected that this is a good practice. Some lower-level units even said: "We hope that you (referring to the Ministry of Foreign Trade) will reject more of the unnecessary documents we send to you, so that we can pay attention to correcting ourselves in the future."

    After we carried out a practical rejection of unnecessary incoming and outgoing documents, our internal bureaucracy has been significantly overcome. For example, in the past, when some comrades picked up a pen to write to sending organizations, they always wrote "all specialized general companies" or "all provincial and municipal foreign trade bureaus." However, in reality, the matter itself had nothing to do with many companies or foreign trade bureaus. Now, when comrades write to sending organizations, they can generally carefully consider which organizations need to be sent to and which organizations do not need to be sent to. This has reduced a large portion of outgoing documents. For another example, we rejected many unnecessary contract copies sent by the Xinjiang Import Company, and they no longer send them.

    Therefore, I believe that the secretarial departments of organizations carrying out a practical and thorough rejection of unnecessary incoming and outgoing documents is one of the better ways to overcome bureaucracy. Because through the rejection of documents, cadres can be educated in practice, the types of unnecessary outgoing documents can be identified, and methods to overcome them can be formulated. At the same time, if all organizations reject unnecessary documents, then bureaucracy will meet the fate of "a rat crossing the street," with everyone shouting to kill it.

    对克服文牍主义的一点建议
    周正中
    在目前我们某些机关文牍主义严重存在着的情况下揭发文牍主义，批评文牍主义是必要的。但是，我认为更主要的是应当行动起来，只有拿出具体措施和办法来才能有力的克服机关中的文牍主义。
    根据对外贸易部近一年来的经验，我认为机关秘书部门对于所收到的不必要的文件实行卡退是克服文牍主义的方法之一。在1955年夏天对外贸易部在举办文牍主义展览会的同时就提出秘书部门应当对于不必要的收发文进行卡退。卡退就是秘书部门，对于本机关的发文进行审查，发现不必要行文和抄送的文件就退回不发；对于本机关的收文也进行审查，发现不必送或者与本机关关系不大的文件经过一定的审查手续提出理由退回原发文机关。近半年多来我们仅在一部分收发文中，就卡退了一千多件文件。卡退这样多文件可能有人会认为对工作发生了坏的影响了吧？不，并没有发生坏的影响。我们所卡退回去的一千多件文件，至今并没有一个单位提出不同意见或者是指责。相反的，在机关内部和某些下级单位都反映这样作很好。有的下级单位还说：“希望你们（指外贸部）对于我们发给你们的不必要的文件，多卡退一些回来，以便于我们今后注意改正。”
    经过我们对于不必要的收发文进行了切实的卡退，才使得我们机关内部文牍主义有了较显著的克服。例如，过去有些同志一提笔写发送机关，总是写“各专业总公司”，或者“各省市外贸局”。但是，实际上事情本身与很多公司或外贸局是毫无关系的。现在同志们在写发往机关时，一般都能认真地考虑需要发送那些机关，不需要发送那些机关。这样就减少了很大一部分发文。又例如，我们对新疆进口公司送来的很多不必要的合同副本，我们卡退之后就再不送来了。
    所以，我认为机关的秘书部门对于不必要的收发文进行切实彻底的卡退是克服文牍主义较好的办法之一。因为通过文件的卡退能够在实践中教育干部，找出不必要的发文的类型，制定克服办法。同时，如果各机关都对不必要的文件进行卡退，那么，文牍主义就会遭到“老鼠过街”人人喊打的命运。
