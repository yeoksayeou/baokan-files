    Xinhua News Agency, November 15th: China's first stamp factory began construction in Beijing today.

    The new stamp factory was designed with the help of Czechoslovak experts. The entire process, from applying adhesive and drying to cutting and printing, will be automated. In the past, printing a single engraved stamp required fourteen steps; in this factory, only four steps will be necessary. The factory will house over two hundred machines, each capable of printing 540,000 stamps per hour.

    In the past, China did not have a dedicated stamp printing factory, and stamps were printed by general printing factories on consignment. Commemorative stamps could only be printed in monochrome and could not be mass-produced. Once this factory is completed, it will be able to mass-produce commemorative stamps with four colors, color postcards, and ordinary stamps. The error between two colors during color stamp printing will be extremely small, reaching world-class standards.

    第一座邮票工厂
    据新华社15日讯　我国第一座邮票工厂，今天在北京动工兴建。
    新建的这座邮票工厂是捷克斯洛伐克专家帮助设计的。这座工厂从刷胶、烘干、剪切到印刷都是自动化的。过去，印刷一枚雕刻板的邮票，需要十四道手续，在这个工厂里只要四道手续就够了。厂房内将有二百多台机器，每台机器在一小时内可以印出五十四万枚邮票。
    我国过去没有专门印刷邮票的工厂，邮票都是委托一般印刷工厂代印的。纪念邮票只能印单色，又不能大量生产。这座工厂建成以后，能够大量印刷带有四种颜色的纪念邮票、彩色明信片和普通邮票。在印彩色邮票的时候，两种颜色的误差极小，可以赶上世界水平。
