    When I arrived on the outskirts of Budapest on a cold and rainy late night, sporadic gunfire could still be heard from the city center. Looking towards the city, the unextinguished lights formed a hazy white glow, flickering faintly in the drizzle. This was only a few days ago. It was not easy to reach the city center. The routed counter-revolutionary elements were still shooting. The people still had to cower in basements, consuming the little bread that remained. The Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government, with the help of the Soviet army, was saving this city that had almost lost its socialist achievements.
    The further I went into the city, the clearer I saw the city's features, and the more I felt the atmosphere of this emergency. When I began to contact people and heard about the events that took place in the short days of late October and early November, it became even clearer to me that this struggle on the banks of the Danube had serious significance not only for the Hungarian brothers, but also for the people of the entire socialist camp.
    People told me that in those days, everything was in chaos. People's thoughts could not keep up with the changes in the situation, but when people began to come to their senses, they found that socialism had become a suddenly vanished word. The people I came into contact with expressed a clear and consistent understanding: behind the people's just demands and legitimate anger, counter-revolutionary elements were rampant.
    I will no longer recount the tragic scenes of counter-revolutionary terror and frantic destruction that I heard about in those short days. I just want to use materials from a newspaper I saw to illustrate the rapidity and significance of the changes. This is a description of the external appearance of the Parliament Building, the center of state power, during those days. During the days of the Nagy government, it started with workers' representatives coming, then farmers bringing grain to the capital, but suddenly the number of these representatives decreased, and many people who no one had elected increased. In the corridors, it was filled with landlords, shareholders, and old officers in Horthy uniforms smelling of mothballs, who opened the doors of the ministerial offices and demanded that their factories and the confiscated one hundred or two hundred holds of land be returned to them. I was a step late and didn't see these people in leather jackets and Horthy uniforms smelling of mothballs walking around the streets. However, now in front of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs building, you can still see many cars with large American flags and Red Cross emblems, and the building is crowded with people wearing various motley clothes. Hungarian comrades told me that these were Western reporters who had poured in before and after the incident, a total of more than three hundred, some with passports and some without, and now they are all clamoring to leave the city quickly.
    A day or two ago, gunfire could still be heard at night, and many shops and warehouses were looted by the routed counter-revolutionary elements, but now the gunfire has completely stopped. Budapest is beginning to show a peaceful scene. On a cold November morning, I walked through the unique streets and squares of Budapest. Thousands of grain stores, many shops, including the largest "Corvin" department store in the country and the famous "Young Pioneer" children's store, have already started business. People are buying goods in an orderly manner. Some people are sweeping up broken glass and fallen leaves all over the ground. Young couples pushed strollers with children in them onto the boulevards. People who bought bread hurried home. People who had temporarily gone elsewhere also returned one after another with their backpacks. A small number of Soviet troops patrolled the streets. I saw that the Hungarian army and police, which had disintegrated in the turmoil, also appeared on the streets to assist the Soviet army in maintaining order. Many Soviet soldiers shed blood for the liberation of Hungary in 1945, and now they are shedding their blood and sweat here to save Hungarian socialism.
    The destruction and loss of many major streets in Budapest is relatively heavy. Lenin Avenue and Rákóczi Avenue are riddled with bullet holes. Restoration work has begun, and people are helping to clean up the destroyed wires and street lights. Technical inspection of urban traffic is still in progress. These streets are crowded with Hungarian people engaged in peaceful labor.
    The Danube River still flows calmly. The iron bridges over the river are intact. Only part of the valuable National Art Gallery was burned down. The majestic Parliament Building, which has changed hands several times, still stands unscathed on the banks of the Danube.
    East of Lenin Avenue, the new theater that was originally preparing to start construction and the beautiful hotel that was recently completed have suffered more or less damage in this rebellion. We saw the former "Free People's Daily" office and radio station, where the turmoil began on the evening of the 23rd. The place where the counter-revolutionary elements used the people's emotions to create armed rebellion is also the place where they were destroyed.
    Government departments have successively started work. Many schools have resumed classes, and the Ministry of Defense is calling for officers to report. The staff of the agencies have reorganized the old documents. The post and telecommunications bureau resumed work the day before yesterday. Various organizations that were once defeated and disintegrated by the enemy—national, party, trade union, and mass organizations—are now beginning to resume activities.
    Vehicles transporting food and ambulances successively passed through the streets. Cities in other areas are supporting the exhausted Budapest. Aid materials from fraternal countries are being transported here one after another. Although the counter-revolutionary forces were once rampant, they never managed to disrupt the supply of water, electricity, and gas in the city. The supply of bread has never been interrupted. As soon as the shooting stopped, the stores supplying milk for children started working.
    Budapest is establishing a normal life. The people's mood is gradually stabilizing. Many people stood on the streets with confused and painful feelings. It is not easy for many people to understand the meaning of the event all at once. But the fighters who are truly loyal to socialism, the patriotic Communists, have already caught their breath, and the people who were once completely desperate about the situation have raised their voices.
    The hearts of the Hungarian people, like the streets here, have left heavy scars. But Budapest in the socialist camp still stands on the banks of the Danube. The imperialists' conspiracy to seize Budapest was ultimately crushed.

    开始进入正常生活的布达佩斯
    新华社记者　李楠
    当我在一个寒风细雨的深夜到达布达佩斯近郊的时候，断断续续的射击声还从市区传来。遥望城里，没有熄灭的灯火织成一片微白迷茫的光辉，在微雨中若隐若现地闪烁。这还是几天前的事情。要到达市中心区是不容易的。被击溃了的反革命分子还在射击。人民还不得不蜷伏在地下室里，吞食已经剩余不多的面包。工农革命政府在苏军的帮助下，正在拯救这座几乎丧失了社会主义成果的城市。
    越走进市区，我越清楚地看出了这个城市的面貌，越感受到了这个紧急时机的气氛。当我开始和人们接触，听到了10月底和11月初那短短几天里所发生的事变时，我越加明了这多瑙河畔的斗争不仅对于匈牙利的兄弟，而且对于整个社会主义阵营的人民具有严峻的意义。
    人们告诉我，在那几天里，一切都混乱起来。人们的思想赶不上事态的变化，但是当人们开始清醒一下的时候，发现社会主义已经变成突然消失的名词了。我所接触到的人们说出了一个明确一致的认识：在人民的正义要求和正当的愤怒后面，反革命分子猖獗地活动起来了。
    我不再追叙我听到的在那短短几天中反革命恐怖和疯狂破坏的惨象。我只想从我所见到的一张报纸上的材料来说明变化的迅速和意义。这是对于国家政权中心的议会大厦那几天外表现象的描绘。在纳吉政府存在的几天中，这里开始是工人代表来，然后是给首都运来粮食的农民，可是突然这些代表的数目减少了，增加了许多谁也没有选举他们的人们。在走廊里，充满了大地主、股东和穿着带有樟脑味道的霍尔蒂军服的旧军官，他们打开了部长办公室的门，要求发还给他们工厂和被没收了的一百或二百霍尔德的土地。我来得迟了一步，没有看到这些穿着皮夹克和充满樟脑味道的霍尔蒂军服的人们在大街上走来走去。可是，现在在外交部的大楼门前，还可以看见许多插着大幅美国国旗和红十字章的汽车，大楼里面还挤着穿着各种杂色服装的人们。匈牙利同志告诉我，这些是在事件前后涌进来的西方记者，一共有三百多人，有带着护照的，也有没有带护照的，现在他们已经纷纷要求迅速地离开这个城市了。
    一两天前，黑夜还听到枪声，许多商店和仓库受到被击溃了的反革命分子的抢劫，但是现在枪声完全终止了。布达佩斯开始出现了和平景象。在11月寒冷的清晨，我走过独具风格的布达佩斯的街道和广场。几千家粮食店、许多商店，包括全国最大的“科尔文”百货公司和著名的“少先队员”儿童商店都已经开始营业。人们正在有秩序地购买物品。有人在打扫破碎的玻璃和满地的落叶。年轻的夫妇把坐着小孩的手推车推到林荫道上来了。买到面包的人匆忙地回家去。临时到别处去的人也夹着背包陆续归来了。少数的苏军在街道上巡逻着。我看到在动乱中解体了的匈牙利军队和警察也出现在街道上，协助苏军维持秩序。有不少苏军士兵在1945年就曾经为解放匈牙利流过鲜血，现在又为挽救匈牙利的社会主义在这里流洒自己的血汗了。
    布达佩斯许多主要街道的破坏和损失是比较重的。列宁大街和拉科兹大街上弹痕累累。恢复工作已经开始，人民在帮助收拾破坏了的电线和路灯。市内交通的技术检查工作还在进行。这些街道上挤满着和平劳动的匈牙利人民。
    多瑙河水仍然平静地流着。河上的铁桥完好无损。珍贵的国立艺术陈列馆内部仅烧去了一部分。几度换了主人的巍峨的议会大厦仍然无恙地耸立在多瑙河滨。
    从列宁大街往东，本来正准备开始动工的新戏院和刚落成不久的漂亮的旅馆，都在这次叛乱中受到了或多或少的损失。我们看到了过去的“自由人民报”社和广播电台，23日晚上的动乱就是在这里开始的。反革命分子利用人民情绪制造武装叛乱的地方也就是他们覆灭的地方。
    政府各部门陆续开始工作。许多学校已经复课了，国防部在召集军官报到。机关的职员又重新理起了旧日的文件。邮电局在前天恢复了工作。一度被敌人打垮和瓦解了的各种组织——国家的、党的、工会和群众组织——现在开始重新活动了。
    运送食物的车辆和救护车陆续经过街头。外地的城市在支援疲惫的布达佩斯。各兄弟国家的援助物资陆续地运到这里。虽然反革命力量曾一度猖獗，但是他们始终没有能够破坏城里水电和煤气的供应。面包的供应也没有断过。射击一停，供应儿童牛奶的商店就开始工作了。
    布达佩斯正在建立正常的生活。人民的情绪逐渐安定。不少的人带着困惑、痛苦的心情站在街头。要许多人一下了解事件的意义是不容易的。但是真正忠实于社会主义的战士、爱国的共产党人已经喘息过来了，一度完全对局势绝望了的人提高了自己的声音。
    匈牙利人民的心，也如像这里的街头一样，留下了沉重的伤痕。但是在社会主义阵营的布达佩斯仍屹立在多瑙河畔。帝国主义夺取布达佩斯的阴谋终究被粉碎了。
