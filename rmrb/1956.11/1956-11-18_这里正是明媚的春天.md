Here is Bright Spring
Ma Shaobo

The Chinese Art Troupe, since leaving Beijing on September 23rd, traveled through Hong Kong, Singapore, Darwin in Australia, Sydney… twenty thousand li of clouds and moon, and arrived safely on October 3rd at the edge of the South Pole – New Zealand.

Now, the motherland should be in the season of red leaves, yellow flowers, and climbing to heights on the Double Ninth Festival; but would you believe it? Here, it is precisely bright spring.

The weather seems very similar to the Qingming Festival season in the motherland, which doubles one's homesickness. On the way from Auckland to Wellington, one truly cannot take in all of the magnificent spring scenery. Peach blossoms, pear blossoms, and crabapple blossoms are already in full bloom, and the tender yellow branches of weeping willows are kissing the river water with boundless affection; the newly green grassland, like an incomparably wide green velvet carpet, covers the rolling hills and unfolds towards the horizon, and countless flocks of sheep are scattered upon it, leisurely grazing. From a distance, it is simply impossible to tell whether it is clouds, snow, or the boundless waves of the Pacific Ocean? When the sheep frolic and jump for joy, people's hearts also jump with them, look, how much they resemble a flock of white doves flying to cover the sky, greeting the bright sunshine!

The scenery of spring in New Zealand is intoxicating, and the friendship of the New Zealand people is like spring. We received a warm welcome from New Zealand friends all the way from Auckland to Wellington.

On October 6th, we were invited to visit the world-famous scenic spot Rotorua Geothermal Area. On this day, the Maori chief and his tribesmen all wore their national festive costumes and held a grand welcoming ceremony in the chief's hall of worship. Chief Mitchell wore an egret feather crown, a white fur cloak, and held a wooden board resembling a scepter in his right hand, and gave a loud speech in Maori, his voice clear and resonant, his manner like singing. He said:

"Dear Chinese guests, welcome! Welcome! A hundred welcomes to you!"

The Maori girls specially performed song and dance programs for the guests. They were all barefoot, with loose hair, wearing flower crowns, and grass skirts around their waists, dancing gracefully, especially one program that was very similar to the Chinese "playing meteor."

The girls led us to visit the geysers. Here, the mountains were covered with geysers, the spring water boiling, shooting up several feet, steam rising, hot mist spreading, even the land was hot to the touch. The residents here can cook rice by simply digging a small hole anywhere. New Zealanders call this place "the land of fire." An old Maori lady named Leni shouted loudly in Chinese "Come, come, come!", and then pointed very sincerely to the gurgling geysers and said to us: "Our hearts towards you are as hot as this!"

When we visited the famous Waitomo Caves and were on our way to Hamilton by car, on the pastures along the road, three Maori shepherd girls wearing red clothes waved to us enthusiastically. As soon as our car passed, they jumped on three white horses and chased after the car. When our car slowed down, they rode up, leaned forward on their horses, smiled, and threw a few dandelions into the car window.

Mr. Wilson, who had visited China, specially invited all the members of the Chinese Art Troupe to his home for a banquet. His home is in Booth, which is already in the south of New Zealand. The climate in New Zealand becomes colder the further south you go, the spring snow has not melted, and the mountains are all white-headed. We were still a little chilly on the way to the banquet. Wilson set up a feast on the lawn of his flower-covered manor. Before we arrived, he had already brewed Longjing tea for the guests, and as soon as we got out of the car, he began playing Chinese folk songs on the record player. Most interestingly, he hung a Chinese red satin table cover high on a large screen, embroidered with golden lions playing with embroidered balls.

Wilson raised his glass and said sincerely:

"Dear friends, when it was still spring in China this year, I saw many wonderful Peking operas and beautiful songs and dances in Beijing. At that time, I fantasized so naively: could there be such a day in my life when these artists could be invited to my home as guests? Who would have thought that in just a few months, the dream that I thought was impossible has actually come true today! Everyone can fully imagine the excitement and happiness of me and my whole family, can this be described in words?"

On the 9th, at the welcome reception held by the Mayor of Christchurch, Dr. Duff, the director of the Canterbury Museum, gave a long speech in which he praised the great achievements of the Chinese people in building their motherland and the ancient and beautiful artistic traditions. Finally, he ended his speech with such touching verses:

"Confucius said: 'Isn't it a pleasure to have friends coming from afar!' It is difficult for New Zealanders to see white cranes, and it is a great auspiciousness and blessing if people can see one in their lifetime. The arrival of the Chinese Art Troupe is truly like rare white cranes descending from the sky! Although New Zealand and China are tens of thousands of miles apart, the waves of the Pacific Ocean wash the sea cliffs of China and also wash the sea cliffs of New Zealand. The ocean does not separate us, but connects us, making us feel connected and in harmony with each other. I believe that in the future, New Zealanders will not see white cranes only once in a lifetime, but will be able to see them every year!"

Christchurch Mayor MacFarlane said in his welcome speech: "China is the oldest country in the East, the great people China's representatives not only bring beautiful art, but also bring valuable friendship. Please tell the Chinese people: the New Zealand people love peace, and the New Zealand people are willing to advance together with the Chinese people on the road of peace and friendship."

When we passed through Auckland and Hamilton, the mayors of these two cities also held grand welcome banquets for us, expressing the same wishes as Mayor MacFarlane. Hamilton Mayor Braithwaite wore a formal suit and a chain of medals around his neck at the reception he held. Obviously, he was moved by the guests' friendly sincerity and the beauty of the art. He stood up during the banquet and excitedly quoted Confucius, saying: "If I hear the Way in the morning, I can die content in the evening!" He immediately left his seat to perform and help the guests have a good time, he personally led the singing, conducting all the New Zealand men and women accompanying guests in singing the famous New Zealand folk song "They Are All Jolly Good Fellows."

Wherever we went here, New Zealand friends held many grand welcome receptions for us, and at the same time, they were deeply intoxicated by Chinese art. Mr. Davis, who had lived in Tianjin for forty-seven years, expressed his feelings in Chinese, he said: "My life history records this: China is my second hometown. When I was in China, I watched many Peking operas. Who would have thought that in my old age, I would have such good fortune to see it again. Peking opera is more glorious and moving than in the past. I have been so excited for the past few days that it feels like I have drunk too much alcohol. When I sit in the theater every day and see you appear on stage, I feel as if I have suddenly returned to my hometown after many years of traveling far away, so intimate, so sweet!"

On the night of October 13th, the Chinese Art Troupe concluded its performance in Christchurch, and many New Zealand friends ran to our residence late at night to congratulate us on the success of the performance. Historian Ms. Woodham gave the Chinese Art Troupe precious gifts, and she said excitedly:

"Seeing your wonderful performance reminds me of the naive excitement I felt when I first saw ballet in my childhood. Now, as an adult, such excitement is rare, but the beauty of great Chinese art has awakened my childhood innocence! Please allow me to thank you deeply! Respected guests - the artists of New China, the citizens of New China."

Mr. Carroll, the general manager of the Carroll Theatre Company who invited us, also said excitedly at the meeting:

"Your performance is wonderful! The wings of my imagination are far behind the peak of your great art, your success has far exceeded what I imagined. I can definitely say that the success of your performance in Christchurch determines that you will be successful wherever you go; I can say one more thing with certainty: any theater in the world that has not invited you, then they must regret it!"

Artist Ms. Power kissed the faces of the Chinese actresses affectionately one by one, saying:

"Lovely messengers of spring! Spring in New Zealand has come with you!"

As I write this, a flock of swallows swept past the window.

Swallows, please take this short letter, take it to Beijing, and report safety to my great motherland and dear mother, when she asks about our well-being, please tell her: here is bright spring.
October 14, 1956, in Christchurch, New Zealand

    这里正是明媚的春天
    马少波
    中国艺术团自从9月23日离开北京，经过香港、新加坡、澳大利亚的达尔文、悉尼……两万里路云和月，于10月3日平安地到达南极的边缘——新西兰。
    现在，祖国应是红叶黄花重阳登高的季节了；然而您相信么？这里，却正是明媚的春天。
    看来天气很像祖国的清明前后，使人倍增乡思。从奥克兰到惠灵顿的途中，真是观赏不尽那春光绮丽。桃花、梨花、海棠花已经盛开了，垂杨柳嫩黄的枝条正在无限深情地吻着小河流水；新绿的草地像一幅无比宽阔的绿绒毯掩过绵亘起伏的小丘岭向天涯展开，数不清的羊群散布在上面悠闲地吃草，远望去，简直辨不出是云是雪，还是太平洋上无边的浪花？当羊群嬉戏欢跳的时候，人们的心也跟着欢跳起来，看哪，多像遮天飞翔的白鸽群在迎着艳艳阳光啊！
    新西兰春天的景色醉人，新西兰人民的友情如春，我们从奥克兰到惠灵顿，沿途都受到新西兰朋友的热情欢迎。
    10月6日，我们应邀游览了世界著名胜地洛托罗喷沸泉。这天，毛利族酋长和他的族民们全都穿了民族的节日盛装在酋长礼拜的厅殿里举行了隆重的欢迎仪式。酋长米歇尔戴鹅翎冠，披白毛氅，右手持一个像圭臬样子的木板，用毛利话高声致词，其声朗朗，样子很像在歌唱，他说：
    “亲爱的中国客人，欢迎你们！欢迎你们！一百个欢迎你们！”
    毛利族的姑娘们特地为客人们表演了歌舞节目，她们都赤着脚，披发，戴花冠，腰系蒲叶草裙，婆娑起舞，异常优美，其中有一个节目极像中国的“耍流星”。
    姑娘们引我们参观了喷沸泉，这里遍山布满喷泉，泉水沸腾，直上数丈，热气蒸蒸，热雾漫漫，连土地也热得烫人。这里的居民随便在什么地方挖一个小洞就可以煮饭，新西兰人把这里叫作“热的土地”。有一位名叫莱妮的毛利族老太太用中国话大声喊着“来，来，来！”，然后十分诚挚地指着突突冒跳的喷沸泉向我们说道：“我们对你们的心和这一样热呀！”
    当我们游览了著名的阿托摩石洞乘汽车到哈秘尔顿的途中，在路旁的牧场上，有三个穿着红色衣衫的毛利族的牧羊姑娘热情地向我们招手。我们的汽车刚刚驶过，她们便跃身跨上了三匹白马，在汽车的后面紧紧地追送，等我们的车子缓下来了，她们便拍马赶上来，在马上欠身微笑着把几朵蒲公英投进了车窗。
    曾到中国访问过的威尔逊先生，特地邀请中国艺术团的全体人员出席了他的家宴。他的家在布斯，这里已是新西兰的南方了。新西兰的气候越往南越冷，春雪未化，山皆白头。我们在赴宴的途中，还有点春寒料峭哩。威尔逊在他花木掩映的庄园的草坪上设了筵席。我们还未到，他早就为客人们烹好了龙井茶，我们刚下车，他就开始用唱片播送着中国的民间歌曲。最有趣的，他在一个大屏风上高高地挂起了一幅中国的红缎桌帏，上面绣着金晃晃的狮子滚绣球。
    威尔逊举起杯来诚挚地说道：
    “亲爱的朋友们，在今年还是中国的春天时候，我在北京看到很多精彩的京剧和美妙的歌舞，我当时这样天真地幻想：在我一生中能不能有这么一天，这些艺术家们能够被邀请到我的家里来作客呢？谁想到不过几个月的时间，我当时以为不可能成为事实的梦想今天居然实现了！大家完全可以想像得到我和我全家的兴奋和快乐，这是可以用语言来形容的么？”
    9日，在克里斯丘却市长举行的欢迎会上，坎特伯利省图书博物馆馆长道夫博士作了长篇的讲演，他盛赞中国人民建设自己祖国的伟大成就和古老而优美的艺术传统，最后他用这样动人的诗句来结束他的讲话：
    “孔夫子说过：‘有朋自远方来，不亦悦乎！’新西兰人很难见到白鹤，人们若在一生中能够见到一次那是莫大的吉祥和福气。中国艺术团诸位的来临，真是像罕见的白鹤一样地从天而降！新西兰和中国虽然相隔数万里，可是太平洋的浪头冲洗着中国的海崖，也冲洗着新西兰的海崖，海洋不是把我们隔开了，而是把我们联在一起，使我们之间心心相印，息息相通，我相信今后我们新西兰人看见白鹤不再是一生一次，而是年年能够和她相见！”
    克里斯丘却市长麦克法伦在欢迎词中这样说：“中国是东方最古老的国家，伟大的人民中国的代表不仅带来美丽的艺术，而且带来了可贵的友谊，请你们告诉中国人民：新西兰人民是爱好和平的，新西兰人民愿在和平友谊的道路上，和中国人民一道前进。”
    我们路过奥克兰和哈秘尔顿的时候，这两个城市的市长也为我们举行了隆重的欢迎宴会，在讲话中表达了和麦克法伦市长同样的愿望。哈秘尔顿市长卜拉斯维特在他举行的酒会上，穿了大礼服，项间挂着项圈勋章。显然的，他是被客人们友好的诚意和艺术的优美所感动了，他在席间站起身来激动地引用孔子的话说道：“朝闻道，夕死可矣！”他立刻离座为客人们表演助兴，他亲自领唱，指挥着席间所有的新西兰男女陪宾们齐唱新西兰著名民歌“他们都是很好的人”。
    我们在这里所到之处，新西兰的朋友们为我们举行了多次盛大的欢迎会，和这同时，他们也深深地为中国的艺术所陶醉着。曾经在天津住过四十七年的戴维斯先生用中国话述说他的感想，他说：“我的生命史这样记载着：中国是我的第二故乡，我在中国的时候，看过许多京戏，谁想在我的晚年，又有这样好福气看到它。京戏比过去更光采动人了，我兴奋得几天以来好像是喝了过量的酒。当我每天坐在剧场里看到你们一出场的时候，我就觉得自己好像多年远游忽然回到了故乡那样亲，那样甜！”
    10月13日夜，中国艺术团结束了在克里斯丘却城的演出，许多新西兰朋友深夜跑到我们的住所来祝贺我们演出的成功。历史学家梧杜姆特女士给中国艺术团赠送了名贵的礼品，她激动地说道：
    “看到你们美妙的演出，使我想起了幼小时代第一次看到芭蕾舞的那种天真的激动的情景，现在，作为一个成年人说来，这样的激动是稀有的了，然而伟大的中国艺术的美，给我唤回了童年的天真！请允许我向你们深深感谢！尊敬的客人们——新中国的艺术家，新中国的公民。”
    邀请我们的主人卡洛尔剧院公司总经理卡洛尔也在会上兴奋地说：
    “你们的演出妙极了！我的想像的翅膀大大落后于你们伟大艺术的高峰，你们的成功超出我所想像的远得多，我肯定地说你们在克里斯丘却演出的成功，决定你们到哪里都会成功；我再肯定地说一句：世界上哪个剧院没有邀请过你们，那末他们一定要后悔！”
    艺术家包艾尔女士亲热地一一地吻着中国女演员们的脸说道：
    “可爱的春天的使者们哟！新西兰的春天跟你们一道儿来了！”
    我写到这里的时候，一群小燕子从窗前掠过。
    燕儿啊，请你把这封短信带了去吧，带到北京，向我的伟大的祖国和亲爱的母亲报告平安，当她问起我们寒暖的时候，请你告诉她：这里正是明媚的春天。
