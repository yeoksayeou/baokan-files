Argentinians Love Chinese Art
蕭光　万光

In October, the first full month of spring in the Southern Hemisphere (spring begins on September 21st), Buenos Aires, the capital of Argentina, appears particularly charming. Besides the mild weather, the thriving flowers, plants, and trees decorate the city beautifully. Major events in art, culture, sports, and many other areas often take place at this time, attracting local citizens and tourists from far and wide. Argentinian friends generally believe that this October was especially lively, and the people of Buenos Aires were particularly excited. The center of this change was the visiting performance of the Chinese Art Troupe.

The Chinese Folk Art Troupe began its first public performance on October 11th. Although box seats were priced as high as 1,200 pesos (approximately $40 USD) and main hall seats were 220 pesos each (approximately $7 USD), the combined tickets for all four performances (tickets to see two shows at once) sold out completely within just three hours, more than a week before the performances. According to local regulations, theater combination tickets can be pre-sold, but single tickets must be sold within 24 hours before the show starts. Therefore, during the Art Troupe's performances, long lines of men and women could be seen forming in front of the theater every morning to buy tickets. Some employees and students even took time off from work or school to buy tickets.

The Art Troupe performed at the Colón Theater (Colón is Spanish for Columbus), which is very famous throughout the Western Hemisphere. This is a Greek-Roman style building located in Lavalle Square, with six floors, 3,200 seats, and elevators for the audience to move freely up and down. The stage is 58 feet wide and has excellent sound equipment. The Colón Theater has its own symphony orchestra, chorus, opera company, and ballet company. World-renowned singers, dancers, conductors, and theater groups often come here to perform their most brilliant programs. Every May, when the music and opera season begins, the theater manager personally goes to Europe or other places to invite first-class artists, dance troupes, or theater groups to perform.

The Colón Theater is considered the pride of Buenos Aires and its center of theatrical culture. An old architect familiar with the history of the Colón Theater told us that although "Colón" is a place desired by everyone in Buenos Aires, it is rarely full because of its high ticket prices and many seats; often only two-thirds or one-half of the seats are occupied. Therefore, the overwhelming success of the Chinese Art Troupe's performances was unprecedented. The enthusiasm of the audience was also rarely seen; they gave long applause after each program, shouting "Encore!" "Red Silk Dance," "Lotus Dance," and "Yandang Mountain" were all repeated at every performance. The audience refused to leave after the encore performance of "Yandang Mountain" in the final program, continuing to applaud until the performers came out to greet them several times.

On the opening night, many people excitedly talked about how the number of social celebrities present, the length of the applause, and the enthusiasm of the atmosphere were the greatest since World War II. October 12th is the anniversary of Columbus' discovery of the Americas. At night, people wore brightly colored national costumes and danced and sang in the streets to celebrate the day. However, many people still abandoned the festive revelry and rushed to the theater to see the show. Sailors from ships arriving in Buenos Aires from places like England and the Netherlands headed straight to "Colón" as soon as they landed, willing to stand to watch the show. 180 Chinese sailors who had traveled across the Atlantic from Hong Kong via South Africa specially presented a flower basket to show their respect for the artists from their motherland. After each performance, enthusiastic audience members waited outside the theater, applauding, shaking hands with the performers, and asking for autographs; shouts of "Bravo!" echoed in Lavalle Square.

In just a few days of performances, "Ópera de Beijing" "Beijing Opera" (as Europeans and Americans habitually called the Art Troupe) had become the most important topic in Buenos Aires social life. In schools, on streets, in shops and cars, and even at every cocktail party, people couldn't help but talk about "Ópera de Beijing."

Newspapers devoted significant space to reviewing the Chinese Art Troupe's performances. Playwrights and musicians engaged in extensive discussions. They were particularly interested in the fact that Peking Opera integrates the essence of various arts.

"La Prensa" wrote: "The esteemed Spanish philosopher Ortega y Gasset believed that the radiant sunset of the theater would turn into a glorious dawn; if the innovators of the stage could combine movement, music, color, and expression into a new form needed by the modern stage to replace those incomprehensible conventions or to return to the old-fashioned expressions. The performance of the Chinese artists not only shows that these words are correct but also confirms the insight of this Spanish philosopher. They are like a group of outstanding art masters who not only possess these qualities but also brilliantly combine poetry, music, dance, pantomime, martial arts, and color, without being limited by time and movement. It can be said that this is a new way to express theatrical emotions and ideas; a new technique to inspire the audience's emotions; a charm emitted by the actors in their concentrated and authentic performances, which powerfully penetrates the depths of the appreciator's heart and infects them."

"La Nación" said: "The artists' portrayal of characters is a true masterpiece, although they use a technique completely different from ours. The scenery, constructed from simple materials to create various landscapes, is a beneficial attempt. The costumes are gorgeous, and the richness and variety of colors are unbelievable. These are all positive factors that beautify and enhance the overall effect of the performance." "La Nación" believes that Peking Opera "is a brilliant and refined art with great descriptive value"; "The true expressions of Western audiences are difficult to describe: they are both dazzled by the actors' extraordinary talents and deeply moved by the inherent meaning of the programs." "La Nación" especially introduced the traditional style of Chinese Peking Opera music, saying that the accompaniment of Peking Opera has beautiful melodic tunes. "This accompaniment, unlike the common polyphonic performance, consists of many different instruments playing an independent yet harmonious tune simultaneously in intermittent succession. The art of singing amazes the listeners, it is very diverse, singing and speaking alternate, using a very natural, rhythmic and intonated recitation and a rhythmic chanting. This is often unfamiliar and novel to the temperament of Westerners."

"La Razón" said: "Chinese artists seem to be masters of both martial arts and comedy. Their realistic approach allows them to observe things and people with the utmost sensitivity and ingenuity, and to express them subtly. The dances depicting war and the pretended struggles unfold like whirlwinds, full of invigorating energy, liveliness, and joy. Although, it is obvious that this whirlwind has its own rules and organization that cannot be rough, otherwise, it would be impossible to express this seemingly irregular, but actually perfectly coordinated in action rhythm and time, amazing scene." The newspaper continued, "The Chinese troupe is not only able to express this thrilling scene but also able to successfully express delicate poetry at the same time. The artistic level of this country with a long artistic tradition has reached the pinnacle of perfection."

The Argentine art world is learning about Chinese art with great interest. Before the Art Troupe arrived in Buenos Aires, the Argentine National Academy of Dramatic Arts held two report meetings at the National Cervantes Comedy Theater on October 8th. One report was given by Professor Edith de Céspedes, titled "About Chinese Music and Drama"; the famous set designer Samaró Benavente gave another topic: "The Performance of Peking Opera." There were also slides to accompany the presentations. On the day the Art Troupe concluded its performance, the Argentine art world invited Zhao Feng, deputy head of the Art Troupe, to the same theater to talk about Chinese art. The "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" policy currently implemented in China, is of particular interest to many Argentine artists. They raised many questions in this regard, which Zhao Feng answered.

Although Argentina and China are far apart, the Argentine public has long been fond of Chinese art. In Buenos Aires, there is a National Museum of Decorative Arts, exhibiting ancient and modern crafts and furniture from European and Asian countries. About one-fifth of it is Chinese: porcelain, jade, and screens engraved with West Lake scenery, etc. When the Art Troupe visited this museum, they brought some Chinese paintings and Dunhuang patterns and gave them to the museum. The curator, Jorge Bindo, said repeatedly while looking at them, it's wonderful, it's so beautiful. He said that he would set aside a part of the museum specifically to display the gifts from the Art Troupe.

During the Art Troupe's performances at the Colón Theater, the theater also gathered ancient and modern Chinese crafts owned by some Argentine collectors and held a "Chinese Art Exhibition" in the theater. During the intermissions of each performance, the exhibition area was crowded with audience members.

Joséini, an excellent young playwright from Argentina, told us that he is adapting the modern Chinese opera "The White Haired Girl." He said: "It is a pride and responsibility for me to introduce modern Chinese art to the Argentine people." Last year, the Buenos Aires People's Theater staged a play "Zhao Xiaolan" written by the Chinese writer Jin Jin, with Spanish dialogue, which was very popular among the audience.

This time, the Chinese artists not only introduced Chinese art to Argentina but also learned from excellent Argentine art on the spot. At two gatherings, Argentine artists enthusiastically performed Argentine folk dances, music, and songs for the Chinese artists. Actors from the Colón Theater's ballet company taught the Chinese dancers popular Argentine dances such as the handkerchief dance and the tango. They also learned fragments from the Chinese "Red Silk Dance" and "Ordos Dance." Affectionate feelings were established in the process of mutual learning. When parting, the Argentine ballet dancers said with tears in their eyes, we will definitely meet again and have the opportunity to continue our learning.

October 21st is Argentina's Mother's Day. On the eve of the festival, Chinese female singer Liu Shufang sang a song she had just learned in Argentina in her performance at the Colón Theater. This "Little Gift" is a song that the famous Argentine folk composer Horacio Guarany dedicated to his mother on her birthday, brimming with respect, love, and hope from the heart. When Liu Shufang finished singing this song, the entire audience erupted in a storm of applause for as long as five minutes.

While the Art Troupe was in Buenos Aires, they visited the Argentine House of Drama, where some famous Argentine actors received us. The president of the House of Drama, Pedro Doxie, said, we welcome you with open arms. The home of Argentine dramatists is also the home of world dramatists, and the locks in our hearts are open to you. The House of Drama was founded in 1935 by Regina Pacini de Alvear (the wife of the then-president, a famous female singer) so that some retired actors could spend their later years here for free. Now, about forty old male and female actors live here. When the Chinese artists visited them in their rooms, they shook hands with us excitedly.

The famous Argentine female writer Maria Rosa Oliver said at a reception for the Art Troupe that Chinese art is novel and beautiful to us, and at the same time, it is easy to understand and kind; Chinese artists are young and talented, and at the same time, they are humble and simple. She said that being with Chinese artists is like being in a poem, a dream, and a fairyland.

The Art Troupe's short half-month stay in Argentina passed quickly. On the day of departure, the organizer of the Art Troupe's performances in Buenos Aires this time, Iliberri, said to head of the troupe Chu Tunan that the Art Troupe not only left a deep impression on the artistic performances but also provided a good example for the Argentine art world in terms of the artists' demeanor, diligent study, and mutual collaboration.

At the farewell, Argentine friends said to us: "This is just a short farewell, and we will see you again soon. Either you will come to Argentina to introduce more of your blossoming flowers, or we will go to China to perform our tango, carnival dances, and everything we love."

These are exactly what the people of the Chinese Art Troupe are thinking and want to say.

    阿根廷人喜爱中国艺术
    萧光　万光
    10月，南半球春天的头一个完整的月份（9月21日开春），在阿根廷的首都布宜诺斯艾利斯显得格外迷人，除了不冷不热的气候，欣欣向荣的花草树木把城市点缀得更加美丽；艺术、文化、体育等许多方面的大事也常在这个时候进行，吸引着当地市民和远近的游客。阿根廷朋友普遍认为今年的10月特别热闹，布宜诺斯艾利斯人也特别兴奋；引起这种变化的中心是中国艺术团的访问演出。
    中国民间艺术团在10月11日开始首次公演。虽然包厢的票价最高达到一千二百个比索（约合四十美元），正厅每张二百二十个比索（约合七个多美元）；四场的一万二千多张联票（一次买看两场的联票）在演出前的一个多星期，仅仅三个钟头之内就卖得精光。按照当地法令规定，剧院联票可以预售，单票必须在开演前二十四小时内出卖。所以在艺术团演出期间，每天清晨在剧院门前都可以看见男一队、女一队排列着长长的买票队伍。有些职员和学生甚至请了假来买票。
    艺术团在整个西半球都很出名的哥伦剧院（西班牙语哥伦就是哥伦布）公演。这是一座有着希腊—罗马式风格的建筑，座落在拉瓦利广场，有六层楼，三千二百个座位，观众可以乘电梯自由上下。舞台宽五十八呎，音响装置很好。哥伦剧院有它自己的交响乐队、合唱队、歌剧团和芭蕾舞剧团。世界著名的歌唱家、舞蹈家、乐队指挥和剧团常到这儿来演出他们最精采的节目。每年5月，音乐和歌剧季节开始的时候，剧院经理人都要亲自到欧洲或其他地方去邀请第一流的艺术家、歌舞团或剧团来上演。
    哥伦剧院被看成是布宜诺斯艾利斯的骄傲和它的戏剧文化中心。熟悉哥伦剧院历史的一位老建筑师告诉我们：虽然“哥伦”是布宜诺斯艾利斯人人所向往的地方，但是因为它的票价高、座位多，很少客满；上座的观众经常是座位的三分之二或二分之一。所以中国艺术团演出时卖座的盛况是空前的。观众情绪的热烈也很少见，他们对每一个节目报以长时间的鼓掌，大声地喊着“再来一个”。“红绸舞”、“荷花舞”和“雁荡山”场场都重演。观众在最后的节目“雁荡山”重演以后还不肯走，一直鼓掌到几次请演员出来见面。
    开幕式那天晚上，许多人兴奋地谈起：今晚到场的社会名流之整齐、鼓掌之长久，情绪之热烈，在哥伦，还是二次世界大战以来的第一次。10月12日，是哥伦布发现美洲大陆的纪念日。夜晚，人们穿了鲜艳的民族服装在街上尽情地跳舞、歌唱来庆贺这个日子；但仍有许多人放弃了节日的狂欢赶到剧院去看戏。从英国、荷兰等地开来布宜诺斯艾利斯的轮船上的海员们，刚一登岸就奔向“哥伦”，站着看戏也情愿。从香港经南非航行越过大西洋而来的一百八十个中国海员，为了表示他们对祖国艺术家的敬意，还特地献上了一只花篮。每天散场以后，热情的观众等在剧院门口不走，他们热烈地向演员们鼓掌、握手、请求签名；“布拉浮”（“好！”）“布拉浮”的喊声回荡在拉瓦利广场的上空。
    仅仅演出几天，“奥波拉·得·北京”“北京歌剧院”（欧洲人和美洲人都习惯这样称呼艺术团）已成为布宜诺斯艾利斯社会生活中最重要的话题。学校里、大街上、商店和汽车里，甚至每一个鸡尾酒会上，人们都少不了谈论谈论“奥波拉·得·北京”。
    报纸以重要的篇幅评介中国艺术团的演出。戏剧家和音乐家广泛地展开讨论。他们特别感到兴趣的是：京剧综合了各种艺术的精华。
      “人民报”写道：“有声望的西班牙哲学家奥尔得加·茄山德认为戏剧界灿烂的晚霞将变成光辉的黎明；如果舞台的革新者能够把动作、音乐、色调和表情综合成为现代舞台所需要的一种新的形式来代替那些不可理解的陈规或是回到旧式的表现的话。中国艺术家的表演不仅说明这些话是对的，而且证实了这位西班牙哲学家的明见。他们正像一群杰出的艺术大师不但具有这些品质，而且不受时间和动作的限制，精采地把诗歌、音乐、舞蹈、哑剧、武打和色彩综合在一起。可以说，这是一种表达戏剧情感和观念的新方式；一种启发观众情绪的新手法；一种演员们在他们聚精会神和真实地表演时所发出的魅力，这种魅力有力地渗入欣赏者内心深处去感染着他们。”
    “民族报”说：“艺术家们对于性格的刻划是真正的杰作，虽然他们采用的是一种和我们完全不同的手法。布景以简单的材料构成各种各样的景色，是一种有益的尝试。服装华丽、颜色的丰富和种类繁多到令人难以置信的程度。这些都是美化和提高整个演出效果的积极因素。”“民族报”认为京剧“是一种辉煌和精炼的艺术，有着大大的记述价值”；“西方观众的真正神色是难以描述的：他们既已被演员的非凡的才能搞得眼花缭乱，又因为节目的内在意义而大受感动。”“民族报”特别介绍了中国京剧音乐的传统的风格，说京剧的伴奏有着美妙的曲调旋律。”这种伴奏与常见的多音演奏不同，是由许多种不同的乐器时断时续地同时奏出一种独立而又和谐的曲调。演唱的技艺使得听众惊奇，它非常多样化，唱和说相互接替着，用一种极为自然的，有抑扬顿挫韵律的朗诵和一种有节奏的吟诵。这对西方人的脾性常是很不熟悉和新奇的。”
    “新闻报”说：“中国艺术家看来是武打和喜剧的才华洋溢的大师。他们现实主义的手法，使他们能够最锐敏和精巧地观察事情、人物，并且微妙地表现它们。表现战争的舞蹈和假装的斗争像旋风似地展开，充满着令人奋发的生气，活泼和愉快。虽然，很明显，这种旋风有它丝毫不能粗差的规律和组织，如果不那样，就无法表现这种表面上似乎不很规则、实际上动作节奏和时间完全一致的惊人的场面。”报纸接着说，“中国剧团不仅能够表现这种惊险的场面，而且同时能够成功地表现细腻的诗意。这个具有悠久的艺术传统国家的艺术水平已达到了炉火纯青的程度。”
    阿根廷的艺术界怀着很大的兴趣来了解中国的艺术。艺术团到达布宜诺斯艾利斯以前，阿根廷全国戏剧学会10月8日就在国立塞万提斯喜剧院举行了两次报告会。一个报告是由教授艾地斯·德塞勒斯主讲，题目是“关于中国的音乐和戏剧”；名布景设计家萨马罗·本那文得讲另一个题目：“京剧的表演”。当场还有幻灯片配合。在艺术团结束演出的一天，阿根廷艺术界又邀请艺术团副团长赵沨到同一剧院谈中国的艺术。中国目前执行的“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的方针，特别使阿根廷许多艺术家感到兴趣。他们提出了不少这方面的问题，由赵沨作了解答。
    阿根廷和中国虽然相距遥远，但是阿根廷公众很久以来就喜爱着中国的艺术。在布宜诺斯艾利斯，有一个国立装饰艺术馆，展览着欧洲和亚洲一些国家的古代和近代工艺品、家具等。里面大约有五分之一是中国的东西：瓷器、玉器，以及刻有西湖风景的屏风等等。艺术团参观这个博物馆时，带去一些中国的国画和敦煌图案，送给博物馆。馆长乔治·宾多看着这些连声说，好极了，美极了。他说，他将辟出馆内一部分，专门来陈列艺术团的礼物。
    哥伦剧院在艺术团演出期间，还把阿根廷一些收藏家所有的中国古代和近代工艺品集合起来，在剧院里举办了一个“中国艺术展览”。在每场演出中间休息时间，展览的地点都挤满了观众。
    阿根廷优秀的年轻的剧作家何塞尼向我们说，他正在改编中国现代歌剧“白毛女”。他说：“把中国现代艺术介绍给阿根廷人民，对我说来是一种骄傲和责任。”去年，布宜诺斯艾利斯人民剧院曾经用西班牙对话上演过中国作家金近写的一个话剧“赵小兰”，很受观众的欢迎。
    这次，中国的艺术家们不仅向阿根廷介绍了中国的艺术，而且就地向阿根廷优秀的艺术学习。阿根廷艺术家们在两次集会上，热情地为中国艺术家表演了阿根廷民间舞蹈、音乐和歌曲。哥伦剧院的巴蕾舞剧团演员们教了中国舞蹈演员们阿根廷流行的手帕舞、探戈舞等。他们也学习了中国“红绸舞”、“鄂尔多斯舞”中的片断。亲切的感情在相互学习的过程中建立起来。分别时，阿根廷巴蕾舞演员们含着眼泪说，我们一定能再见，再有机会继续进行我们之间的学习。
    10月21日是阿根廷的母亲节。在节日的前夕，中国女歌唱家刘淑芳在哥伦剧院的演出中，唱了一首新在阿根廷学会的歌。这首“小小的礼物”是阿根廷著名民间作曲家奥拉西欧·瓜拉尼在他母亲生日一天献给母亲的歌，洋溢着从内心出来的崇敬、爱戴和希望的感情。当刘淑芳唱完这首歌时，全场响起暴风般的掌声达五分钟之久。
    艺术团在布宜诺斯艾利斯的时候，访问了阿根廷戏剧之家，一些阿根廷著名的演员们在那里接待着我们。戏剧之家主席彼得罗·多希说，我们伸开双手欢迎你们。阿根廷戏剧家的家也同时是世界戏剧家的家，我们心灵里面的锁是向着你们开着的。戏剧之家是1935年由雷西娜·巴克西尼·得·阿尔维亚尔（当时总统的夫人，一个著名的女歌唱家）创立的，让一些退休的演员们在这里可以免费度过他们的晚年。现在，这里住了约四十个男女老演员们。中国艺术家到他们住的房间里拜访他们的时候，他们激动地同我们握手。
    阿根廷著名女作家玛利亚·罗莎·奥利佛在一次招待艺术团的聚会上说，中国艺术对我们是新奇的和优美的，同时又是容易了解的和亲切的；中国艺术家是年青的和有才华的，同时又是谦虚的和朴素的。她说，同中国艺术家相处，就像在诗里、梦里、仙境里一般。
    艺术团在阿根廷逗留的短短的半个月，很快就过去了。临走的一天，艺术团这次在布宜诺斯艾利斯演出的组织者伊利白利向楚图南团长说，艺术团这次不仅在艺术表演上留下了深刻的印象，而且在艺术家的风度、勤奋钻研、相互协作方面，给阿根廷艺术界提供了良好的范例。
    在告别的时候，阿根廷朋友向我们说：“这只是一番小别，我们很快就要再见。不是你们来阿根廷更多地介绍你们齐放中的百花，就是我们去中国演出我们的探戈舞、狂欢节舞以及我们所喜爱的一切。”
    这些正是中国艺术团的人们心里所想的和所要说的。
