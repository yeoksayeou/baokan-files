Xinhua News Agency, November 20th -- Technical renovations are being carried out on some of the busiest railway trunk lines to increase transportation capacity.

Currently, eleven large train stations are under construction for expansion or renovation, including Jinzhou, Datong, Jining, Fengtai, and Sujiatun Station near Shenyang. Expansion projects already completed include the Shijiazhuang and Zhengzhou stations on the Beijing-Hankou Railway, the Guye station on the Beijing-Shenyang Railway, and the border station Pingxiang, which leads to Vietnam.

Nearly four hundred train stations across the country have extended their railway sidings for train parking, allowing each train to pull several more railcars.

The construction of a double track between Anyang and Zhengzhou on the Beijing-Hankou Railway has begun. More than half of the double-track project between Fengtai and Shijiazhuang has been completed. Foundation work for the double track between Shijiazhuang and Yangquan on the Shijiazhuang-Taiyuan Railway is underway. The double-track project between Zhengzhou and Luoyang on the Longhai Railway recently commenced.

The railways undergoing reconstruction include the Baoji-Lanzhou section of the Longhai Railway, as well as the Binbei, Suijia, Huning, Nantongpu, and Shenji six trunk lines.

In addition, the Banjiahe Bridge on the Shenshan Line, the Xinyi River Bridge on the Longhai Line, the Yellow River Bridge and the Gejia River Bridge on the Jinpu Line, the Nenjiang Bridge on the Pingqi Line, and the Xiangjiang Bridge on the Yuehan Line are all being rebuilt because they cannot accommodate heavier trains.

    重要工程：改造大小车站，增加复线，改建某些干线，重新修建部分桥梁
    新华社20日讯　运输最繁忙的一些铁路干线正在进行技术改造，以提高运输能力。
    目前正在兴工扩建或改建的大火车站有十一个，包括锦州、大同、集宁、丰台、沈阳附近苏家屯车站等。扩建工程已经完工的有京汉路上的石家庄和郑州车站，京沈路上的古冶车站，通往越南的国境站——凭祥车站。
    全国还有近四百个火车站延长了停放列车的铁路股道，这样可以使得每趟列车都可以多拉几节车皮。
    京汉铁路安阳到郑州间已经开始建设复线。丰台到石家庄间的复线工程已经修好了一大半。石太铁路石家庄到阳泉间正在做复线的基础工程。陇海铁路郑州到洛阳间的复线工程在最近开工了。
    正在进行改建的铁路有陇海铁路宝鸡兰州段以及滨北、绥佳、沪宁、南同蒲、沈吉等六条干线。
    另外，沈山线上的班家河桥、陇海线上的新沂河桥、津浦线上的黄河桥和葛家河桥、平齐线上的嫩江桥、粤汉线上的湘江大桥，因为不能通过较重的列车，也都重新修建。
