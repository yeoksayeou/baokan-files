Observations on Inspecting Water Conservancy Work in Hunan
Representative of the National People's Congress Wang Baozhen

When I first arrived in Changsha, a responsible comrade from Hunan Province said: Hunan Province has experienced the longest drought period this year, unprecedented in decades; however, the total output of rice is still higher than in any previous year. Upon first hearing this, I was quite surprised, wondering how such a severe drought could still lead to increased production. After listening to the reports from the water conservancy work comrades and my own inspection, I learned that this was the result of the successful water conservancy work carried out in Hunan.

During this inspection, I found that whether they were provincial-level cadres or county and township-level cadres, they were all very familiar with the water conservancy work in their respective regions, answering questions fluently and possessing detailed materials. Each region had its own water conservancy plan tailored to local conditions. I visited the transformation of the low-lying areas of Dongting Lake and the water conservancy projects in the two key counties of Ningxiang and Liling. At ponds, reservoirs, dams, and other water conservancy facilities, groups of men and women could be seen stepping on waterwheels to irrigate and carrying water. In Dachengqiao Township, Ningxiang County, which is a hilly area, there used to be seven-tiered waterwheels. Therefore, despite the prolonged drought, the rice still grew lushly. I asked the masses when the water conservancy facilities in various places were built. They said that every winter, they made water conservancy construction an important task. Constructing water conservancy projects has become a habit for the farmers here.

Water Conservancy Work in Ningxiang County

Ningxiang County is a semi-mountainous and semi-hilly area, with the Wei, Wu, and Jin rivers flowing through it. During the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, due to the extensive destruction of forests, massive soil erosion, siltation of river channels, and elevation of riverbeds, large floods were difficult to discharge, and water disasters increased year by year. In addition, the restrictions of the feudal system prevented the masses from unified water conservancy construction, thus being constantly threatened by drought.

In the seven years since liberation, the Party and the government have actively led the county's farmers, in addition to renovating old water conservancy projects, building 1,018 new ponds, 203 river dams, 45 new wells and springs, and 76 other small projects. Now, the county has a total of 73 renovated and newly built reservoirs, more than 54,000 ponds, 6,108 river dams, 696 wells and springs, and 291 other projects. These water conservancy projects not only can store and discharge floodwater but will also basically eliminate drought and flood disasters. It is said that the largest upper and lower Guantang (irrigation ponds) can hold enough water to irrigate 1,000 mu of land, resisting drought for about 50 days. The smallest pond can also hold enough water to irrigate 20 mu of land, resisting drought for about 30 days (both calculated based on one cun of water lasting for three days). Now, relying on ponds and reservoirs, the threat of drought can be greatly reduced in the county's farmland. Therefore, although Ningxiang County experienced a long drought this year, it still achieved a bumper harvest. The general yield of early rice is about 400 jin per mu, with the highest yield reaching 1,100 to 1,200 jin; it is estimated that the general yield of late rice will also be above 300 jin, with only individual areas experiencing reduced production due to not planting late rice. The farmers in this county have a saying: "Yiyang relies on Bodhisattva, Ningxiang relies on ponds and dams" (after liberation, Yiyang has vigorously carried out water conservancy construction and no longer relies on Bodhisattva), which shows people's emphasis on water conservancy. In recent years, in addition to investing in helping the masses repair water conservancy projects, the government has also trained a large number of water conservancy technicians. The county has already formulated a plan to basically eliminate drought and flood disasters next year.

One of the most famous water conservancy projects in Ningxiang County is the Weifeng Dam. The Weifeng Dam is located about one kilometer downstream of the Ningxiang warehouse. The water stored by this dam supplies two channels, each more than 100 kilometers long. The entire channel system can irrigate more than 122,700 mu of rice fields and is fully navigable. This can be said to be a great and magnificent project in the countryside. At Tancun Bay, midway through the canal system on the left bank, a double-layered sluice gate was established, and the Shahe Hydroelectric Power Station was built, which can generate 81.2 kilowatts of electricity, which can be used to power irrigation for machines in more than a dozen villages; it can also be used for electric lighting. The local masses wrote on the wall: "The brilliance of socialism shines on the countryside."

Sihe Reservoir Brings Thousand-Jin Mu

Sihe Reservoir is located in Chuanwan Township, southeast of Liling County, about 50 li from the city. It is a model small reservoir built with the assistance of Hunan Province in the winter of 1953. The dam is made of uniform soil, 17.5 meters high, and the reservoir has a storage capacity of 80,000 cubic meters. The Sihe Reservoir irrigation area also has 53 flat ponds, 170 mountain ponds, and 22 stone dams, with a total storage capacity of 1.9 million cubic meters. There are seven agricultural production cooperatives in this township, with more than 4,000 mu of paddy fields and 1,280 mu of dry land. Before the construction of the reservoir and the unified establishment of management organizations, it was often threatened by floods and droughts. It is said that during the severe drought in 1943, most of the rice fields yielded no harvest after fifty days of drought, and the farmers survived by eating Guanyin soil, tree bark, and wild grass. Local people said: "Don't marry your daughter to Lejia'an (a place name in the Chuanwan Township irrigation area), planting grain is like going down to hell, if it doesn't rain for a few days, it dries up like a ghost crying!" Since the establishment of Sihe Reservoir and the renovation of small ponds and dams, the difficulty of insufficient irrigation water has been basically overcome. Now, the drought resistance capacity of the entire irrigation area has been raised to an average of more than 50 days. At the same time, the seven shallow flat ponds have been turned into 38 mu of fertile land, and 62 mu of eroded land has been turned into paddy fields. Although it has not rained for dozens of days this year, not only is there no sign of drought, but also because the entire irrigation area has planted double-cropping rice, the average yield per mu may be increased to 1,100 jin.

Transformation of Low-Lying Areas

Low-lying areas refer to the southern part of Dongting Lake, the confluence point of the Xiang and Zi Rivers, also known as the South Dongting Lake area. This area is suitable for growing rice. However, due to the past occupation of land by feudal landlords and their competition for reclamation, the embankments were chaotic, the water flow was not smooth, and serious floods were often caused. After liberation, the Communist Party and the People's Government promptly analyzed the root causes of the floods, mobilized tremendous forces, planned and merged embankments and streams in the South Dongting Lake area, changed the flood channels of the Xiang and Zi Rivers, separated the main streams of the two rivers; and built some dam projects to control the diversion of the Zi River, reducing the mutual support of the Xiang and Zi Rivers. At the same time, the original seven scattered dikes between the main stream and tributaries of the Zi River were renovated into a large dike - Xiangbin Nanhu West Dike. This changed the seven complex rivers between the Xiang and Zi Rivers into one. This not only reduced the threat of floods but also expanded the cultivated land area and ensured increased production in the lake area.

Beautiful Yanglinzhai Farm

Yanglinzhai Farm is located in Xiangbin Dike. Standing on the dike, one can see the wide and solid entire dike, about a hundred miles around, like a great and magnificent city wall. The top of the dike can be used for car traffic, like a ring road around the city. Looking into the dike, in the farm's more than 3,300 mu of rice fields, flocks of ducks swim in the inner lake and ponds. The newly built red and blue brick houses are the farm's dormitories and offices. The farmers' houses are distributed in every corner of the dike. Channels, ponds, and inner lakes have been renovated in the farm's rice fields, and the sound of drainage machines can be heard from afar. The farm's trucks are constantly running on the dike, transporting grain and goods. Outside the dike is a vast expanse of lake water, with some fishing boats and cargo ships traveling back and forth. The entire scenery of Yanglinzhai Farm is beautiful and moving.

I once wrote a limerick:

Xiang River sends me a boat of wind.
Thousands of acres of golden waves rippling.
I love looking at Dongting Lake the most,
Yellow grains fill the dike, the sunset is red.

Now the farm has not only eliminated the disaster of floods but also ensured the continuous bumper harvest of double-cropping rice. According to the farm cadres, the average yield of rice in the dike can reach more than 800 jin per mu. There is also an inner lake in the dike, which can be used for large-scale fish farming, producing a lot, and the food company often goes to purchase it. This place is called "the land of fish and rice," which is truly well-deserved.

Several Points Worth Learning

1. Comrades from the Water Conservancy Department said that in Hunan Province, there is about one mu of pond for every ten mu of fields, storing water for irrigation. Liling County plans to destroy more than a thousand mu of fields next year to build more than one hundred new ponds and small reservoirs. They have all calculated the accounts clearly, preferring to change a small number of fields into ponds and weirs in order to increase the yield of the majority of fields. This is a wise plan. In Hunan, the construction of ponds and reservoirs is mostly done by farmers providing voluntary labor, with the state subsidizing a small amount of material costs. People's labor on water conservancy work accounts for a large part of their annual labor. People use their hard work to change the natural environment and create conditions for everyone to increase production.

2. Hunan's water conservancy work has advanced creations in technology, which is the result of the combination of leadership and mass experience. For example, the Weifeng Dam in Ningxiang stores water for navigation and opens channels for irrigation. The dam is equipped with 57 movable wooden flap gates. When one wooden bolt is pulled out, the 57 wooden flap gates open automatically. According to the Water Conservancy Department, this is the result of absorbing the experience of farmers and technicians providing guidance. Another example is the movable electric pumping station created by the Water Conservancy Department on the river bank, which pumps water to irrigate the fields as the river waves rise and fall. These all show the advancement of Hunan's water conservancy work.

3. Farmers in Hunan use ponds, ditches, and harbors to raise fish and ducks, plant lotus roots and water chestnuts, and build racks on the edges of ditches and ponds to cultivate creeping crops, increasing production and farmers' income.

The above practices are well worth learning for places that often suffer from serious disasters.

    视察湖南水利工作观感
    全国人民代表大会代表　王葆真
    我刚到长沙的时候，湖南省一位负责同志谈：湖南省今年的旱期最长，是几十年来所未有；但稻谷的总产量，还比已往任何年多。初听到这话，有些诧异，不知这样大的旱情还能增产是何原因。及至听过水利工作同志的报告和我亲身的视察，了解到这是由于湖南水利工作开展良好而获得的结果。
    我在这次视察中，见到无论是省级干部，无论是县、乡干部，对自己地区的水利工作都很熟悉，对答如流，而且都有详细的材料。各个地区，都有着自己的因地制宜的水利规划图。我曾看了洞庭湖低洼地区的改造和宁乡、醴陵两个重点县的水利工程。在池塘、水库、水坝等水利设施，到处可见到成群结队的男女在登水车灌溉与挑水。宁乡县大成桥乡是丘陵地带，曾有连登七层的水车。因此，虽是长期干旱，但是水稻仍然长得茂盛。我曾问及群众各地的水利设施是什么时候修建的。他们说，每逢冬季，即把兴修水利当成重要的工作。兴修水利，已成这里农民的习惯。
    宁乡县的水利工作
    宁乡县是半山半丘陵地区，有沩、乌、靳三江流过。在国民党反动统治时期，由于山林多遭破坏，水土大量流失，河道淤塞，河床抬高，较大洪水宣泄困难，水灾逐年增加，加以封建制度的限制，群众不能统一兴修水利，因而时受旱灾的威胁。
    解放七年来，党和政府积极领导全县农民，除整修了旧的水利工程外，新建了水塘一千零一十八个、河坝二百零三座、新开井泉四十五个，其它小型工程七十六处。现在全县整修和新建的水库共有七十三座，水塘五万四千多个、河坝六千一百零八座、井泉六百九十六个、其它工程二百九十一处。这些水利工程，不但能蓄泄洪水，并将基本上消除旱、涝灾害。据说，最大的上、下灌塘，可容浇灌一千亩田的水量，抗旱五十天左右。最小的塘也能容浇灌二十亩田的水量，抗旱三十天左右（均按一寸水维持三天计算）。现在依靠水塘和水库，全县农田中，可以大大减少旱灾的威胁，因此，今年宁乡县虽然旱期较长，仍然获得了丰收。早稻一般的亩产量在四百斤左右，最高的产量到一千一、二百斤；估计晚稻一般的也在三百斤以上，只有个别地区，因没种上晚稻而减产。这个县的农民有一句谚语：“益阳靠菩萨，宁乡靠塘坝”（解放后益阳已大力兴修水利，不靠菩萨了），可见人们对水利的重视。近几年来，政府除投资帮助群众修整水利工程外，并训练了大批的水利技术人员。这个县已经订出明年基本上免除旱、涝灾害的办法。
    宁乡县最有名的水利工程之一是沩丰坝。沩丰坝在宁乡仓库下游约一公里的地方。这座坝的蓄水供给两个各长一百多公里的渠道。全部渠道可灌溉十二万二千七百多亩稻田，并可全部通航。这可以说是乡村中一项伟大壮丽的工程。就在左岸渠系的中途檀村湾，设立了双层水闸门，建立了沙河水力发电站，可发电八十一点二基罗瓦特，电力可供十几个乡村机器灌溉；还可供给电灯之用。当地群众在墙上写着：“社会主义的光辉照耀着农村。”
    四合水库带来了千斤亩
    四合水库位于醴陵县城东南船湾乡，距城约五十里，是湖南省在1953年冬协助兴建的一座示范小型水库。坝是均匀土质，高十七公尺半，水库的蓄水量是八万公方。四合水库的灌区还修有平塘五十三个，山塘一百七十个，石坝二十二座，总蓄水量是一百九十万公方。这个乡有七个农业生产合作社，共有水田四千多亩，旱地一千二百八十亩。在修建水库和统一建立管理组织以前，常受洪水冲刷和旱灾威胁。据说1943年大旱五十天大部稻田颗粒未收，农民靠吃观音土、树皮和野草度日。当地群众说：“养女莫嫁乐家庵（系船湾乡灌区地名），种谷下泥车下摇，几天不下雨，干得像鬼叫！”自四合水库建立和整修小塘坝以来，基本上克服了灌溉用水不足的困难。现在全灌区的抗旱能力平均提高到五十天以上。同时，将淤浅的七口平塘变为三十八亩良田，并使六十二亩冲刷的土地变为水田。今年虽然几十天没有下雨，不但看不到旱情，而且由于全灌区种植了双季稻，产量平均每亩可能提高到一千一百斤。
    低洼地区的改造
    低洼地区是指的洞庭湖的南部，是湘、资二江的汇合点，也叫南洞庭湖区域。这个地区宜于种植水稻。但由于过去封建地主霸占土地，竞相围垦，因而堤垸混乱，水流不畅，经常造成严重水灾。解放后，共产党和人民政府及时分析了水灾发生的根源，动员了巨大的力量，在南洞庭湖区有计划地并垸并流，改变了湘、资两水的洪道，使二水主流分离；并建筑了一些水坝工程，控制了资水的分泄，减轻了湘、资二水的相互顶托。同时把资水主流、支流间原有的七个分散的垸子，改修成为一个大堤垸——湘滨南湖西垸。这样把湘、资两水间错综复杂的七条河流改成为一条。这不仅减轻了洪水的威胁，而且扩大了耕地面积，保证了湖区的增产。
    美丽的杨林寨农场
    杨林寨农场在湘滨垸内，人们站在堤垸上，可以看到宽大坚固的全部堤垸，四周约百余里，俨如一座伟大壮丽的城墙。堤垸的上顶可以通行汽车，有如一道环城公路。向垸内望去，农场三千三百多亩的稻田中，群鸭在内湖池塘里游泳。新修起的红蓝色的砖房，这是农场的宿舍和办公室。农民的住房，分布在垸内各个角落。在农场的稻田中，均整修了渠道和池塘、内湖，老远可以听到排水机器的声音。农场的载重汽车不时地在堤垸上奔驰着运粮运东西。垸的外面，就是一片汪洋的湖水，间有一些鱼船和运货船来去航行。整个杨林寨农场的风光美丽动人。
    我曾写了一首打油诗：
    湘江送我一船风。
    万顷金波荡漾中。
    最爱洞庭湖上望，
    黄穰满垸晚霞红。
    现在农场既消除了洪水的灾害，又保证了双季稻的连年丰收。据农场干部谈，垸内稻谷平均每亩可产八百斤以上。垸中还有内湖，可以大量养鱼，出产很多，食品公司常去收购。这个地方称为“鱼米之乡”，真是名副其实。
    值得学习的几点
    一、水利厅的同志说，湖南全省每十亩田约有一亩塘，蓄水灌溉。醴陵县明年计划毁田千余亩修建新塘和小水库一百多个，他们都算清楚了账，宁愿改变少数田亩作塘堰，以提高多数田亩的产量，这是一个明智的计划。湖南修建塘、库多由农民出义务工，由国家补助少数的材料费。人民对水利工作的劳动，占一年劳动的大部分。人们用辛勤的劳动，改变自然环境，给大家创造增加生产的条件。
    二、湖南水利工作技术上有先进的创造，这是领导和群众经验相结合的结果。如宁乡的沩丰坝，蓄水通航，开渠灌溉。坝上设活动木闸板五十七扇。拔开一根木拴，五十七扇木闸板即自动开启。据水利厅说：这是吸取农民经验，由技术员加以指导的结果。又如水利厅在江边创造的活动电灌站随江波涨落，汲水灌田。这都表示湖南水利工作的先进。
    三、湖南农民利用池、塘、沟、港，养鱼养鸭，种植莲菱，并在沟边、塘边搭架，栽培蔓生作物，增加生产，增加农民收入。
    以上这些作法，很值得常患严重灾害的地方学习。
