    Conscientiously Examine Work, Actively Improve Leadership
    Song Defu, concurrently Director of the Zhejiang Provincial Tax Bureau
    The material exposing the bureaucratic work style of several leading cadres in our Zhejiang Provincial Tax Bureau, revealed by Comrade Yao Zhenfa in the People's Daily, is consistent with the facts. The People's Daily editorial on July 16th is correct in its criticism of our bureaucratic work style. On behalf of the leading staff of the Zhejiang Provincial Tax Bureau, I humbly accept this criticism.
    Starting from July 16th, our entire bureau spent two months studying and discussing this People's Daily editorial, and conducted a serious examination from top to bottom of the bureaucratic ideology and work style existing among the leading cadres of the Tax Bureau. According to the examination and summary materials, not only does the bureaucratic style of "not using one's own brain and relying on others for everything" exist among the leading cadres of the Tax Bureau, but also the problems of being content with the status quo, engaging in vulgar and busy事務ism, and adopting a subjective and one-sided work style. This examination and criticism has been very educational for our leading cadres.
    In the work of the leading cadres of the Provincial Tax Bureau, subjective and one-sided problems are also manifested. The main manifestation of this ideological style is: catering to the intentions of superiors, lacking the spirit of proceeding from reality. Daring not boldly reflect the real situation to superiors and raise different opinions; being unwilling to patiently listen to reports from subordinates and carefully study and analyze the situation; reporting good news but not bad news to superiors, and listening to good news but not bad news to subordinates. The emergence of this style also shows that our leading cadres do not pay attention to theoretical study on weekdays, and do not study and implement the steps and methods of the superiors' instructions and policies according to the actual situation, but mechanically implement the instructions, policies, plans, and tasks regardless of the actual situation. Therefore, in many works, a situation of subjective and objective division has appeared. For example, in implementing the superiors' instructions that the tax office is not a basic unit for formulating and implementing tax revenue plans, we did not proceed from the objective actual situation, but rigidly implemented the instructions. As a result, difficulties were caused in the work.
    In the division of labor among the leaders, the bureaucratic habits of our leading personnel were also exposed. Although one director is assigned to lead the overall work, one director is assigned to lead the business work, and another director is assigned to lead the political and ideological work, the division of labor is clear, but the division of labor has become a separation of families, and they do not understand each other's situations in the work. Comrades reflected that the actual formation is that the director is only "in charge of principles" and the two deputy directors are "in charge of one-sidedness." Such a leadership method is bound to promote the bureaucratic work style of leading cadres being detached from the masses and detached from reality.
    The leadership of the Provincial Tax Bureau over political and ideological work is very weak, which is mainly manifested in the lack of standards of right and wrong in carrying out criticism and self-criticism. There are many criticisms and self-criticisms carried out between the leaders and the led in the Provincial Tax Bureau. From the superficial phenomenon, it seems that democracy has been promoted, but because the situation has not been carefully studied, right and wrong have not been clarified, and correct conclusions have not been drawn in carrying out criticism, so as to achieve the purpose of strengthening the unity of superiors and subordinates and improving leadership and improving work, often each holds one-sided materials on many issues and cannot unify understanding. The leadership either adopts a delaying attitude or adopts the method of taking all responsibility regardless of right and wrong for the criticisms raised by the comrades below. Therefore, the purpose of clarifying right and wrong, improving understanding, and uniting superiors and subordinates has not been truly achieved. Therefore, it is also impossible to encourage the masses to actively and correctly carry out criticism from the bottom up.
    Through this examination and analysis of criticism, we have deeply realized that the reason why these bureaucratic leaderships have emerged is because our leading cadres have been buried in business work for a long time, neglecting both theoretical study and going deep into the masses and into reality, and being satisfied with working with old experience, content with the status quo, and proud and complacent.
    In order to overcome these bureaucratic ideological styles, in addition to strengthening theoretical study, we have now decided that each leading cadre must spend at least three months a year going deep into the masses and into reality, in order to establish a work style of facing the masses and facing reality.

    认真检查工作，积极改进领导
    浙江省税务局兼局长　宋德甫
    姚振发同志在人民日报上揭露的我们浙江省税务局几个领导干部的官僚主义作风的材料，是符合事实的。7月16日人民日报的社论，对我们的官僚主义作风的批评是正确的。我代表浙江省税务局领导工作人员虚心接受这个批评。
    从7月16日起，我们全局同志用了两个月的时间，对人民日报的这篇社论进行了学习和讨论，并对税务局领导干部中存在的官僚主义思想作风，自上而下地进行了认真的检查。根据检查总结的材料来看，在税务局领导干部中，不仅存在着已经揭发的“自己不动脑筋，一切依靠别人”的官僚主义，并且还存在着满足现状，庸俗忙碌的事务主义和主观片面的作风。通过这次检查和批判，对我们领导干部的教育是很深刻的。
    在省税务局领导干部的工作中，还表现有主观片面的毛病。这一思想作风的主要表现是：迎合上级意图办事，缺乏从实际出发的精神。对上不敢大胆反映真实情况，提出不同意见；对下不愿耐心听取汇报，认真研究分析情况；对上报喜不报忧，对下听喜不听忧，这一作风的产生，也说明了我们领导干部平日不注意理论学习，不是根据实际情况去研究执行上级的指示、政策的步骤和方法，而是不顾实际情况地把指示、政策、计划和任务，生搬硬套地机械执行，因而，在不少工作中出现了主观和客观分裂的情况。如对执行上级规定税务所不是编制和执行税收计划的基层单位的指示中，就没有从客观实际情况出发，而只是硬性执行指示。结果造成了工作上的困难。
    在领导分工中也暴露了我们领导人员的官僚主义习气，虽然一个局长分工领导全面工作，一个局长分工领导业务工作，另一个局长分工领导政治思想工作，分工是明确的，但是分工变成了分家，在工作中互不了解情况。同志们反映说：实际形成局长只是“原则的领导”两个副局长又是“片面的领导”。这样的领导方法，也必然要助长领导干部脱离群众、脱离实际的官僚主义作风。
    省税务局对政治思想工作的领导是非常薄弱的，这主要表现在开展批评与自我批评上缺乏是非标准。省税局领导与被领导之间，开展的批评与自我批评是不少的，从表面现象上来看似乎是发扬了民主，但是由于开展批评中没有认真研究情况，弄清是非，得出正确的结论，以达到加强上下级的团结和改进领导、改进工作的目的，而往往在不少问题上，各持片面材料，不能统一认识。领导上对下面同志所提出的批评意见，不是采取拖延时间不了了之的态度，就是采取不分是非，全部包下来的办法。因此，并没有真正达到弄清是非、提高认识和上下团结的目的。因而也不能鼓励群众积极地正确地开展自下而上的批评。
    经过这次检查和分析批判，使我们深刻地认识到所以会产生这些官僚主义的领导，是由于我们领导干部长期埋头业务工作，既忽视理论学习，又忽视深入群众、深入实际，满足于凭老经验进行工作，安于现状和骄傲自满的结果。
    为了克服这些官僚主义的思想作风，除加强理论学习外我们现在已决定，每个领导干部，一年至少要有三个月的时间深入群众，深入实际中去，以便树立面向群众、面向实际的工作作风。
