Xinhua News Agency, Mangya Telegram The temperature in the Qaidam Basin in the early morning and evening has dropped to minus seventeen or eighteen degrees Celsius. However, in the Gobi Desert in the western part of the basin, tens of thousands of geological prospectors and workers serving the exploration are still continuing to search for oil for the motherland.

Last winter, there was only one drilling rig working in this basin, and less than three thousand workers participated in winter construction. This winter, however, there are dozens of large and small drilling rigs in operation. To support these drilling operations, more than a thousand large trucks loaded with drilling equipment and winter gear are continuously pouring into the basin from Dunhuang, Xining, and other places.

The geological surveying and other work in this basin have also broken with the past practice of complete rest in winter. Most geological surveying teams and structural mapping drilling teams will work until the end of November or the end of December before stopping. This year, they will complete the detailed surveying of twenty oil-bearing structures for drilling next year.

The winter exploration freeze prevention and warmth preservation work in the Qaidam Basin began in early October. Now, more than 130 kilometers of water pipelines in the Mangya area have been completely laid, and the winter water supply in each exploration area will be fully guaranteed. Heating has been gradually turned on in the Mangya base and nearby exploration areas. Geological prospectors and drilling workers have put on the leather jackets, leather hats, and fur boots issued to them. Burning stoves have also been lit in the mobile houses and tents where the workers live. In order to ensure the smooth progress of winter drilling work, the Drilling Department of the Qinghai Petroleum Exploration Bureau has trained more than one hundred stoker workers in advance; re-training has also been conducted for mud workers and some diesel engine drivers. Technical safety meetings have also been held to specifically study fire prevention, blowout prevention, and other safety measures during winter construction.

Winter exploration work in the Qaidam Basin has received support from all over the country. Recently, nearly a thousand workers, students, and demobilized soldiers have come to the Qaidam Basin despite the severe cold. The Yumen Mining Bureau alone has dispatched seven drilling teams and oil testing teams to work in the basin. The supply work for winter exploration personnel in the Qaidam Basin has received the attention of relevant departments across the country. A large quantity of general merchandise and non-staple food purchased by the Qinghai Provincial Trade Department from Shanghai, Tianjin, Shenyang, Chongqing, and other places is being continuously transported into the basin.

    柴达木盆地气温降到零下十七八度
    地质勘探人员不畏严寒坚持工作
    新华社茫崖电　柴达木盆地早晚的气温已经下降到摄氏零下十七、八度。但是，在盆地西部的戈壁滩上，几万名地质勘探人员和为勘探服务的职工，还在继续为祖国找寻石油。
    去年冬季，这个盆地只有一部钻机在工作，参加冬季施工的职工还不到三千人。今年冬季开钻的大小钻机，却有几十部。为了支援这些钻探工作，一千多辆满载钻井器材和冬季装备的大卡车，正川流不息地从敦煌、西宁等地驶进盆地。
    这个盆地的地质测量等工作也打破了以往冬季全部休整的惯例。大部分地质测量小队和构造制图钻井队，都要工作到11月底或12月底才收工。他们今年将要细测完二十个储油构造，供给明年进行钻探。
    柴达木盆地的冬季勘探防冻保暖工作，从10月初就开始进行。现在，茫崖地区一百三十多公里长的输水管线已经全部铺设完毕，各探区的冬季用水将得到充分供应。茫崖基地和附近各探区的暖气已经陆续开放。地质勘探人员和钻井工人已穿戴上了发给他们的皮衣、皮帽和毛皮靴。职工居住的活动房子和帐篷里，也生起了熊熊的火炉。为了保证冬季钻井工作能够顺利进行，青海石油勘探局钻井处已经提前训练了一百多名司炉工人；对泥浆人员和部分柴油机司机也进行了轮训，并且召开技术安全会议，专门研究了冬季施工中的防火、防喷等安全措施。
    柴达木盆地的冬季勘探工作得到全国各地的支援。最近，有近千个工人、学生和转业军人，不畏严寒来到柴达木盆地。仅玉门矿务局就抽出了七个钻井队和试油队来盆地工作。保证柴达木盆地冬季勘探人员的供应工作，受到了各地有关部门的重视。青海省贸易部门从上海、天津、沈阳、重庆等地采购的大批百货和副食品，正在源源运进盆地。
