    People's Letters Should Be Forwarded Quickly
    On October 26th, I received a people's letter approved by a leading comrade, signed by Comrade Su Jie. In the letter, Comrade Su Jie reflected that the Jiamusi City automotive repair services were not meeting current needs, and put forward his own opinions.
    Logically speaking, the relevant departments should have quickly studied and dealt with this situation. Unfortunately, this letter drifted for two months just in transit. Su Jie submitted this situation in writing to the Heilongjiang Daily on August 25th. The newspaper forwarded the original letter to the Jiamusi Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party on September 3rd. For some unknown reason, the Municipal Party Committee did not forward this letter to the Municipal People's Committee until October 10th. After staying in the Municipal People's Committee for five days, the letter was then forwarded to the Municipal Planning Commission, and it was not until October 26th that it reached the hands of us who do the specific work. What people don't understand is: why does it take so long for a people's letter to be forwarded in the leading organs!

    人民来信要迅速转递
    10月26日我收到了领导同志批下来的一封人民来信，署名的是苏杰同志。在信中，苏杰同志反映了一些佳木斯市汽车修配不能满足当前需要的情况，并提出了自己的意见。
    按理说，有关部门对这一情况应当迅速研究处理，不幸的是，这封信光在旅途中就漂流了两个月。这一情况苏杰是在8月25日向黑龙江日报书面提出的，该报于9月3日把原信转给了中共佳木斯市委会，不知道什么原因，在10月10日市委才把这封信批转到市人民委员会。在市人民委员会呆了五天后，这封信又被转到了市计划委员会，直到10月26日，它才到了我们作具体工作者的手里。人们不明白的是：为什么一封人民来信在领导机关光转递就需要这么长时间！
