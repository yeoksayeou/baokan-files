Xinhua News Agency, November 10th: TASS, London, November 9th: According to British newspapers, the tide of anger among people from all walks of life in Britain against the Anglo-French aggression against Egypt has not subsided.

　　Sixteen faculty members of Westfield College, University of London, wrote a letter of protest to Eden.

　　The United Nations Association of students at the University of Leeds held a meeting and passed a resolution emphasizing that the government's actions "violate the United Nations Charter and endanger world peace."

　　Sixty-one faculty members of the University of Aberdeen condemned the aggression against Egypt, believing that the Anglo-French action "has no moral basis and will only undermine the stability of the world family."

　　Seventy-one scientific staff members of the Bucksburn (Aberdeenshire) Agricultural Research Institute, Evans, President of the Royal College of Science and Technology, London University, and nine professors and thirty-three faculty members of the college jointly issued a protest letter to Eden and members of Parliament.

　　The Friends of Hillhouse in Accra, the colonial capital of the Gold Coast, pointed out in a letter to Eden that "just when the United Nations is in special need of the support of all peace-loving people, we are embarrassed to learn that Britain has violated the United Nations Charter," expressing deep disappointment.

　　The Executive Committee of the British Council of Churches held an emergency meeting on the 9th. The committee passed a resolution, "expressing deep concern that the British government, together with the French government, has repeatedly violated the United Nations Charter and taken unilateral military action."

　　Xinhua News Agency, November 10th: TASS, Paris, November 9th: The well-known female political activist of the French Socialist Party and former member of parliament, Madame Viénot, has announced her withdrawal from the Socialist Party. In a letter to the General Secretary of the Socialist Party, she said: "I can no longer remain in the party because, after coming to power, the party leaders not only violated their promises to the voters, but also violated all moral principles and socialist traditions. Furthermore, in order to cover up their failure in the Algerian policy, they provoked a war, which is regarded as a war of aggression by the whole world, and it has pushed us to the brink of the Third World War."

　　On the 9th, many evening newspapers published commentaries criticizing the adverse consequences of the Mollet government's military adventure in the Near East for France. Many political commentators pointed out the fact that France has been isolated and its international status has been weakened.

    新华社10日讯　塔斯社伦敦9日讯：据英国报纸报道，英国各界人士抗议英法侵略埃及的怒潮一直没有减退。
    伦敦大学威斯菲尔德学院的十六位教职员写了一封抗议信给艾登。
    里子大学学生联合国协会召开会议，通过了一项决议，强调指出政府的行动“违反联合国宪章，并且有破坏世界和平的危险”。
    亚伯丁大学的六十一名教职员谴责对埃及的侵略，他们认为英法这一行动“没有道义基础，只会损害世界大家庭的稳固”。
    巴克斯伯恩（亚伯丁郡）农业研究所的七十一名科学工作人员、伦敦大学皇家学院院长伊凡斯以及这个学院的九位教授和三十三位教员联名向艾登和议员发出了抗议书。
    黄金海岸殖民首府阿克拉的希耳豪斯的公谊会在写给艾登的信中指出，“正当联合国特别需要一切爱好和平的人的支持的时候，我们却难为情地得知英国破坏了联合国宪章”，信中表示这令人深为失望。
    英国教会理事会执行委员会9日举行了紧急会议。委员会通过决议，“对英国政府同法国政府一道不止一次地违反联合国宪章，采取片面的军事行动，表示深为不安。”
    新华社10日讯　据塔斯社巴黎9日讯：法国社会党著名的女政治活动家，前议员维耶诺夫人已经声明退出社会党。她在给社会党总书记的信中说：“我不能再留在党内，因为党的领导人在取得政权之后，不但违背了对选民的诺言，而且破坏了所有的道义原则和社会主义的传统。此外，为了掩饰自己在阿尔及利亚政策的失败，他们挑起了战争，这种战争被全世界认为是侵略战争，它把我们推到了第三次世界大战的边缘。”
    在9日，各家晚报刊登了许多评论，批评摩勒政府在近东的军事冒险给法国带来的不良后果。许多政治评论员都指出了法国已经陷于孤立和它的国际地位被削弱的事实。
