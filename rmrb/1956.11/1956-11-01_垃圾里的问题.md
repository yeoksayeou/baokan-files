    Problems in the Trash
    A working cadre bought some walnuts. The old grandmother selling walnuts used a piece of waste paper to wrap them for him. The paper revealed mimeographed words. It turned out to be a report from the Ningguo County Public Security Bureau of Anhui Province on social security during the 1954 grain purchase and marketing. It was stamped with a bright red "Confidential" seal. He couldn't help but shudder. He asked, "Old Mama, where did you buy these 'waste papers'?" "I picked them up from the toilet in front of the hospital gate. There are many more there!" As she spoke, she took out a bundle of "waste paper" to show him. "Old Mama, can I exchange some old newspapers for them?" The old Mama smiled and said, "Take them if you want them, it doesn't matter if you exchange them or not."
    He took them back and opened them to take a look. Ah! There were reports on social security from the Public Security Bureau, reports from the County Political and Legal Affairs Office on dealing with counter-revolutionaries, confidential work briefings, internal bulletins on grain work from the County Party Committee, registrar registration forms, statistical tables of received cases, emergency notices from the County Party Committee on unified purchase and sales, as well as draft books and document receipt and dispatch books for reporting arrests, totaling fifteen documents with more than one hundred and fifty pages.
    It was later found that this was originally a cadre from the Ningguo County People's Procuratorate, who treated it as garbage and sent it to the toilet.　Meng Xianyi

    垃圾里的问题
    一位工作干部买核桃。卖核桃的老奶奶，用一张废字纸给他包好。纸上显露着油印的字。原来是一张安徽宁国县公安局1954年粮食统购统销中社会治安情况的报告。上面盖着鲜红“机密”戳子。他禁不住身上打一个冷颤。问道“老妈妈：你从那里买来这些‘废纸’？”“我是从卫生院门前的厕所里拾来的，那里还多着呢！”说着她就拿出一捆“废纸”来给他看。“老妈妈我用一些旧报纸同你换可以吗？”老妈妈笑了笑说：“你要就拿去，换不换都行。”
    他拿回来打开一看，啊！有公安局的社会治安情况报告，县政法办公室的处理反革命分子的报告、机密工作简报、县委粮食工作的内部通报、检察员登记表、收接案件统计表、县委对统购统销的紧急通知，以及呈报捕人的拟稿簿和收发文簿等共计十五件一百五十页之多。
    后来查明，这原是宁国县人民检察院的一位干部，把它当作垃圾送到厕所里去的。　孟宪义
