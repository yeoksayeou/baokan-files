    Visiting Lu Xun's Tomb
    Gong Liu
    I saw Mr. Lu Xun sitting in Hongkou Park,
    As if taking a rest during a walk.
    He was still wearing simple cloth clothes,
    As plain as truth itself.
    In his hand he held a scroll of books,
    As if saying: Study, study, and study again.
    His angular forehead,
    The lines of love and hate are so deep.
    In his head, there is a vast ocean,
    Forever fresh living water, washing our souls.
    Isn't it so? In our thoughts,
    Which time doesn't have his waves surging?
    I really want to go forward and chat: talk about life, talk about struggle,
    Talk about all the good and bad aspects.
    But, how could I interrupt his contemplation?
    —In this beautiful day that has finally arrived.
    Yes, the master is bathing in the sunshine of the new China,
    And we are bathing in the master's sunshine.
            Returned from visiting the tomb on October 20, 1956

    谒鲁迅墓
    公刘
    我看见鲁迅先生坐在虹口公园里，
    仿佛是散步中的偶尔一次休息。
    他依旧穿着简单的布衣服，
    就像真理本身一样朴素。
    手里拿着的是一卷书籍，
    仿佛在说：学习，学习，再学习。
    他那棱角分明的前额，    
    爱与恨的线条是如此深刻。
    在他的头颅里，藏着博大的海洋，
    永远新鲜的活水，将我们的灵魂涤荡。
    难道不是吗？在我们的思潮中，
    哪一次没有他的波涛在汹涌？
    真想上前去攀谈：谈生活，谈斗争，
    谈一切好的方面和坏的方面。
    可是，我又怎么能打断他的沉思？
    ——在这终于降临了的美好的日子。
    是的，先生在沐浴着新中国的阳光，
    而我们则沐浴着先生的阳光。
