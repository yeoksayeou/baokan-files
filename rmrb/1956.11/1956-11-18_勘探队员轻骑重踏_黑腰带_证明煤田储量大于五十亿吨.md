Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, November 16th (Xinhua News Agency reporter Wang Jian reports): After further prospecting, the coal-bearing area of the "black belt" of Shaanxi – the Weibei Coalfield – has been confirmed to be approximately 330 kilometers long. This coalfield, averaging five kilometers in width, stretches from Hancheng in the east, westward through Chunhua, Bin County, Yongshou, Linyou, and extends to Xingping, Long County, and other places. The coal reserves are also greatly increased compared to the original estimate of five billion tons.

This new achievement was obtained by a prospecting team dispatched by the Northwest Coalfield Geological Exploration Bureau this year. The prospecting team set out from the Tongchuan mining area, riding horses and carrying instruments, and spent more than two months traveling through the five counties of Bin County to Long County. They investigated the geotectonics and coal seam storage conditions in this area, focusing on prospecting the small coal mines and coal seam outcrops distributed in this area. After comprehensive research on some standardized fossils, the results confirmed that the coal seams in this area and the eastern coal seams of the Weibei Coalfield belong to the same geological component, thus reaching a clearer concept of the scope of the coalfield.

Currently, geological personnel are continuing exploration on the Weibei Coalfield. In addition to conducting detailed investigation work in the Tongchuan mine, they are also continuing to expand the exploration area to the east and west wings of the Tongchuan mining area. At the same time, the development of this coalfield is also being accelerated. (Attached picture)

### 勘探队员轻骑重踏“黑腰带”  证明煤田储量大于五十亿吨

    勘探队员轻骑重踏“黑腰带”
    证明煤田储量大于五十亿吨
    新华社西安16日电　新华社记者汪坚报道：陕西的“黑腰带”——渭北煤田的储煤区域，经过进一步普查以后，证实共长三百三十公里左右。这样，这个平均宽五公里的煤田，东起韩城，向西经过淳化、邠县、永寿、麟游，一直伸展到?阳、陇县等地。煤的储藏量也比原来估计的五十亿吨大大增加。
    这个新的成果是西北煤田地质勘探局今年派出的一支普查队获得的。这支普查队从铜川矿区出发，骑着马带着仪器，在邠县到陇县五个县境内，辗转活动了两个多月。他们调查了这个区域里的大地构造和煤层储煤情况，重点勘察了分布在这个区域里的小煤窑和煤层露头，经过对一些标准化石综合研究的结果，证实这个区域内的煤层和渭北煤田的东部煤层都是属于同一地质组成部分的，因而对煤田的范围得出了更明确的概念。
    目前，地质人员还在渭北煤田上继续进行勘探。他们除了在铜川矿进行精查工作以外，还正在向铜川矿区东西两翼继续扩大勘探区域。同时，这个煤田的开发工作，也正在加速进行。（附图片）
