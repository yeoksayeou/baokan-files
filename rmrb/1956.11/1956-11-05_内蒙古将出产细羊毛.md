Xinhua News Agency Report:

    At the end of October, ewes on the Xilin Gol grasslands of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region comprehensively began regular mating. It is estimated that more than one million lambs will be bred around the Qingming Festival next year. In the past few days, a group of trained artificial insemination technicians have arrived in various banners to prepare for mating.
    The sheep on the Xilin Gol grasslands have a low wool yield and coarse wool quality. Therefore, this year the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region transported more than 1,000 Xinjiang fine-wool rams to mate with Mongolian sheep. Hybrid fine-wool lambs will appear here next spring.

    内蒙古将出产细羊毛
    据新华社讯　10月末，内蒙古自治区锡林郭勒草原上的母羊，全面开始定期配种。预计明年清明前后，将繁殖一百多万只小羊。这几天，经过训练的一批人工授精技术员先后到达了各旗准备给配种。
    锡林郭勒草原的羊产毛量较低，毛质粗糙。因此，内蒙古自治区今年运进了一千多只新疆细毛种羊，和蒙古羊进行配种。明春这里将出现杂种细毛羊羔。
