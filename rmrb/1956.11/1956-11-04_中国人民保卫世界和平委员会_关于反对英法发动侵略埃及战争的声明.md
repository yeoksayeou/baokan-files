    Chinese People's Committee for World Peace
    Statement on Opposition to the Anglo-French War of Aggression Against Egypt
    The flames of war ignited by the Anglo-French aggressors have already been ignited on Egyptian soil.
    After instigating Israel to attack, Britain and France launched a war of aggression against Egypt. This act of armed intervention by Britain and France has violated Egypt's territory and sovereignty, created an unprecedented tense situation in the Middle East, undermined peace in the Asia-Africa region, and seriously threatened world peace and the safety of hundreds of millions of people.
    The Anglo-French invasion of Egypt is a long-planned conspiracy of aggression. They attempt to re-establish colonial rule in Egypt and other Arab countries by occupying the Suez Canal in order to continue to enslave the people of the Middle East. People all over the world unanimously oppose this barbarous action by Britain and France and firmly support the just struggle of the Egyptian people to defend their motherland and maintain peace.
    We, the 600 million Chinese people who love peace, express our strong protest against the barbaric act of Britain and France in armed aggression against Egypt and undermining peace. We call on the people of Asian countries and all peace-loving and justice-upholding people in the world to unite and jointly stop the Anglo-French war of aggression. Together with Asian and African countries and peace-loving countries and people all over the world, we stand with Egypt to jointly extinguish the flames of aggression and save peace. We solemnly warn the Anglo-French aggressors to immediately and quickly stop their adventurous actions of aggression against Egypt.
    We believe that the forces of peace will surely achieve final victory.
                Chinese People's Committee for World Peace

    中国人民保卫世界和平委员会
    关于反对英法发动侵略埃及战争的声明
    英法侵略者所挑起的战火已在埃及国土上燃起了。
    英国和法国在指使以色列进攻后，发动了侵略埃及的战争。英法这种武装干涉的行动，侵犯了埃及的领土和主权，造成了中近东空前的紧张局势，破坏了亚非地区的和平，并严重地威胁着世界和平和亿万人民的安全。
    英、法两国对埃及发动侵略战争是蓄意已久的侵略阴谋，他们企图以占领苏伊士运河来重新恢复在埃及和其他阿拉伯国家的殖民地统治，以便继续奴役中近东各国人民。全世界人民都一致反对英、法这种横蛮的行动，坚决支持埃及人民的保卫祖国、维护和平的正义的斗争。
    我们爱好和平的六亿中国人民，对英、法两国武装侵略埃及、破坏和平的野蛮行为表示强烈的抗议。我们呼吁亚洲各国和全世界爱好和平和主持正义的人民团结起来，共同制止英、法的侵略战争。我们和亚非各国、全世界爱好和平的国家和人民一道，同埃及站在一起，共同扑灭侵略战火，拯救和平。我们严正警告英、法侵略者立即迅速停止侵略埃及的冒险行动。
    我们相信和平力量必将取得最后胜利。
