Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, 21st: Life in the Hungarian capital continues to move towards normalcy. Many enterprises continued working on the 20th. The majority of workers in various foundries and machine manufacturing plants have returned to their jobs. Buses and trucks transported workers from the city to suburban enterprises, and some tram lines have also been opened to traffic. Many district kindergartens and nurseries have opened their doors. Residents are cleaning and repairing damaged streets and houses. The supply of goods is improving day by day, but there is still a phenomenon of queuing to buy things.

Due to insufficient electricity and transportation difficulties, Budapest's production has not yet recovered to half of its normal level. Some factories work from 9:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. Some factories, due to lack of electricity, have only one-third of their employees engaged in direct production, while the rest are engaged in maintenance work or organized into special shock brigades to repair hospitals, schools, and workers' dormitories in the urban area.

Last week, some agitators disguised as workers or members of workers' committees spread strike slogans among the working people, deliberately disrupting the normalization of work in Budapest. There are reports that Hungarian underground counter-revolutionaries, "Radio Free Europe," and many Western radio stations participated in this sabotage. Their attention is focused on Budapest because the city's population accounts for almost one-fifth of the Hungarian population and possesses more than half of the country's industry.

The Presidium of the Hungarian Transport Workers' Free Trade Union Federation has joined the agreement between the representatives of the Budapest Workers' Committee and the Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government. It calls on all Hungarian railway workers to fully resume work and to repair the damage to railway transport as quickly as possible.

News about the resumption of normal work continues to come from all over Hungary. On the 20th, most of the enterprises in Székesfehérvár resumed work. The machine tool factory has started working in full. Those workers who live far away from the factory also came to work. The metal processing factory has also resumed work. This factory faces the difficulty of insufficient power supply.

    匈牙利恢复工作续有进展
    据新华社布达佩斯21日电　匈牙利首都的生活继续趋向正常。许多企业20日在继续工作。各个翻砂厂和机器制造厂的工人已经大部分回到了工作岗位。公共汽车和卡车把工人从城里运到郊区的企业中去，部分电车线也已经通车了。许多区的幼儿园和托儿所已经开门。居民正在打扫和修理遭到破坏的街道和房屋。物资供应情况一天比一天有改进，但是仍然有排队买东西的现象。
    由于电力不够和交通困难，布达佩斯的生产还没有恢复到平常的一半，有些工厂工作时间是从上午九点到下午三点。有的工厂由于电力缺乏，只有三分之一的职工从事直接生产，其余的职工进行保养工作，或者组织成特别突击队到市区去修复医院、学校和工人宿舍。
    上星期，一些伪装工人或工人委员会委员的煽动分子曾经在劳动人民中散播罢工口号，有目的地扰乱了布达佩斯工作的正常化。有消息说，匈牙利的地下反革命分子、“自由欧洲”电台和许多西方电台参与了这次破坏活动。它们的注意力之所以集中在布达佩斯是由于这个城市的人口几乎占匈牙利人口的五分之一，并且拥有全国一半以上的工业。
    匈牙利运输工人自由工会联合会主席团已经参加了布达佩斯工人委员会的代表们和工农革命政府间的协议。它号召全体匈牙利铁路工人们完全复工，并且尽可能快地修复铁路运输所受到的破坏。
    关于恢复正常工作的消息继续从匈牙利各地传来。20日，克什费赫瓦尔的大多数企业复工了。工作母机工厂已经全部开工。那些住在离工厂较远的工人们也来上工了。金属加工工厂也复工了。这家工厂存在着电力供应不够的困难。
