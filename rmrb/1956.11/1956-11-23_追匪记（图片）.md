　　9. But they hadn't gone far when Little Jiang fainted again. The squad leader went up and picked him up. The squad leader bit his lip, thinking: This is our class brother, even if he's a corpse, we have to carry him back whole. Before long, Little Jiang woke up, and they helped him back onto the stretcher.
　　10. After carrying him for only a few steps, the squad leader and Li Yugen couldn't carry him anymore. They pulled the stretcher with difficulty, feeling dizzy and nauseous, pulling two steps and resting for a bit. They shared a common belief: Only by persevering will there be victory. Where eagles can't fly and wolves can't walk, the People's Liberation Army must also go.
　　11. Li Yugen suddenly noticed a group of birds circling in the sky in the distance, and shouted, "Squad leader, look, there are birds looking for something, we're saved!" When they got closer, they saw wild animals eating a dead horse.
　　12. The sun set in the distant desert, and night fell. They started a fire to cook the horse meat. At this time, Zhong Yongsheng stared at the horse's head, thinking, and finally said with great excitement, "Look, isn't this the yellow horse that Jin Zhizhong snatched from the herdsman Naiman? He abandoned the horse here, he must not have gone far!" So they set off that night, following the traces left by the bandit leader.
　　13. The next morning, they found footprints with newly turned sand. Following these footprints, they climbed up the sand ridge and saw something like a bear lying there. This was Jin Zhizhong, the bandit leader of the "Anti-Communist National Salvation Army."
　　14. They caught Jin Zhizhong and escorted him back.
　　15. After taking a few steps, Jin Zhizhong tried to escape when everyone wasn't paying attention. But he didn't run far before a bullet ended his life.
　　16. The three of them, with hearts full of victory, but also extremely exhausted, searched for their unit. When they saw a red flag flashing in the distance, they were very happy.

    9、但走了不多远，小姜又昏倒了。班长上去把他抱起来，班长咬着嘴唇心里想：这是我们的阶级弟兄，就是一具僵尸也要完整地抬回去。不一会小姜苏醒过来，他们又把小姜扶上了担架。
    10、抬了不几步，班长和李玉根就再也抬不动了。他们拉着担架艰难地走着，头发昏心发呕，拉两步歇一歇。他俩有一个共同的信念：只有坚持才会有胜利，鹰飞不过狼不走的地方，解放军也要走过去。
    11、李玉根忽然发现远处有一群鸟在天空盘旋，就喊起来：“班长你看，那里有鸟在找什么东西，我们有救了！”当他们快到跟前的时候，见野兽在吃着一匹死马。
    12、太阳西沉在远处的沙漠里，夜降临了。他们用火烧起马肉。这时钟永胜盯着马头思索，最后异常兴奋地说：“你们看，这不就是金治中抢走牧民乃曼的黄马吗？他把马丢在这里，一定还没有走远！”于是连夜寻着匪首留下的足迹出发了。
    13、第二天的早晨，他们发现有翻起了新砂的脚印，顺着这些脚印爬上砂梁，果然看见有一个像狗熊一样的东西在那里躺着。这就是“反共救国军”的土匪头子金治中。
    14、他们逮住了金治中押着往回走。
    15、走了几步，金治中趁大家不留神，企图逃走。但跑不多远，就被一颗子弹结束了他的性命。
    16、他们三个怀着胜利的心情，但又异常疲惫地寻找着自己的部队，当他们看到远处一支红旗在闪动的时候，心里非常高兴。
