Paying Respects at the Mausoleum at the Foot of Purple Mountain
By our reporters Liu Shiping and Zhang Jing

    On November 12th, the weather in Nanjing was particularly clear. On this day, the Central Pilgrimage Delegation from Beijing, the Jiangsu Province, Gansu Province, and Nanjing and Shanghai Municipal Pilgrimage Delegations, along with foreign guests from various countries, held a solemn ceremony at Purple Mountain to pay respects to Mr. Sun Yat-sen's mausoleum.
    All those who had followed Mr. Sun Yat-sen in the revolution, whether they were old members of the Tongmenghui, early students of the Whampoa Military Academy, or his subordinates, were deeply moved to see the renovated appearance of Sun Yat-sen's Mausoleum today, and to see national leaders such as Zhu De and foreign guests walk up the more than three hundred granite steps to stand before Sun Yat-sen's tomb, offering flowers and paying their respects in solemn commemoration. Mr. Sun Yat-sen's former adjutant, Ma Xiang, was so moved that he wept. Since the entombment in 1929, he had never seen such a grand and solemn pilgrimage held at Sun Yat-sen's Mausoleum. Only today, under the leadership of the Communist Party, do the Chinese people truly value and respect Mr. Sun Yat-sen. After the pilgrimage, he told reporters: "My mood today is both somber and excited. Somber because I have forever lost my closest person, and excited because I see the people of the whole country commemorating Mr. Sun Yat-sen so solemnly, and seeing Mr. Sun Yat-sen's aspirations have been realized. Mr. Sun will surely be smiling in his grave."
    In front of the mausoleum, General Chen Geng and Cherepanov of the Soviet delegation warmly embraced. Thirty years ago, Cherepanov was the chief advisor of the Whampoa Military Academy founded by Mr. Sun Yat-sen, and General Chen Geng was a student of Whampoa. Now, they meet again before the spirit of the founder of the Whampoa Military Academy. This is the embrace of victors, the embrace of fraternal friendship between China and the Soviet Union.
    The Central Pilgrimage Delegation and Soviet representative Cherepanov also laid wreaths at the tomb of Liao Zhongkai. Although Liao Zhongkai's wife, He Xiangning, did not come, her children, Liao Chengzhi and Liao Mengxing, represented her in laying a wreath. To commemorate this educational director at the time of the founding of the Whampoa Military Academy, Chen Geng, Hou Jingru, Li Jue, and Huang Yong, who were students of the Whampoa Military Academy at that time, also laid wreaths. Hou Jingru also hoped that the Whampoa classmates in Taiwan today could return to the mainland of the motherland as soon as possible to participate in socialist construction.
    Finally, wreaths were laid at the tomb of Deng Yanda at Qilinmen in the eastern suburbs of Nanjing. On Deng Yanda's tombstone were inscriptions by Chen Mingshu. The representatives recalled with great hatred when Chiang Kai-shek instigated people to assassinate Deng Yanda. After laying the wreath, Comrade Zhu De said to everyone with grief: Deng Yanda was truly a Three People's Principles believer.
    When the pilgrims returned from Purple Mountain to the city of Nanjing, Mr. Sun Yat-sen's bronze statue at the intersection of Zhongshan Road and Xinjiekou was illuminated by thousands of lights. The people of Nanjing and the people of the whole country will always commemorate this pioneer of the revolution.

    紫金山下谒陵墓
    本报记者　刘时平　张竞
    11月12日，南京的天气，格外晴朗，这一天，从北京赶来的中央谒陵代表团，江苏省、甘肃省、南京、上海两市的谒陵代表团，同各国来的外宾，在紫金山举行了隆重地参谒中山先生陵墓的仪式。
    所有过去追随过中山先生革命的人，不管是老同盟会员，或者是早期黄埔军官学校的学生以及他的部下，看到今天中山陵的面貌焕然一新，看到朱德等国家领导人和各国外宾步行走上三百多层的花岗石台阶，站在中山陵墓前献花行礼，隆重纪念，都受到极大的感动。中山先生生前的侍从副官马湘感动得痛哭流涕。从1929年扶灵安葬以来，他一直没有看到在中山陵前，举行过这样盛大隆重的谒陵，只有今天，在共产党领导下的中国人民，才真正重视和尊敬中山先生。谒陵后，他告诉记者说：“我今天的心情是又沉痛，又兴奋，沉痛的是我永远失去了最亲近的人，兴奋的是看到全国人民这样隆重地纪念中山先生，看到中山先生的遗志已经实现。先生一定会含笑九泉的。”
    在陵墓前，陈赓将军和苏联代表团的契列班诺夫，热情地拥抱起来了。三十年前，契列班诺夫是中山先生所创办的黄埔军校总顾问，陈赓将军是黄埔的学生。如今，他们又在黄埔军校创办者的灵前见面了。这是胜利者的拥抱、是中苏兄弟般的友情的拥抱。
    中央谒陵代表团和苏联代表契列班诺夫又到廖仲恺墓献花圈，廖仲恺的夫人何香凝虽未来，由她的子女廖承志和廖梦醒作代表献了花圈。为了纪念这位黄埔军校创办时的教育长，当时黄埔军校的学生陈赓、侯镜如、李觉、黄雍也献了花圈，侯镜如并希望今天在台湾的黄埔同学，也能早日回到祖国的大陆，参加社会主义建设。
    最后，到南京东郊麒麟门邓演达墓献花圈。在邓演达的墓碑上有陈铭枢的题字，代表们回忆起当年蒋介石唆使人暗杀邓演达的时候，十分痛恨。在献花圈后，朱德同志沉痛地向大家说：邓演达真正是一个三民主义者。
    谒陵的人们从紫金山回到南京城里时，中山路新街口的中山先生的铜像，已在万家灯火照耀下。南京的人民和全国的人民，将永远纪念这位革命的先行者。
