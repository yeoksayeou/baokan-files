    Impressions of a Trip to Cairo
    (An Unpublished Old Poem)
    Wang Tongzhao
    More than twenty years ago, when I went to Europe, the ship passed through the Suez Canal, and I had a day to visit Cairo. Afterwards, I drafted this poem on the ship, but it was never published. Now I have copied it from an old notebook and published it, as a gift to the Egyptian people.
    The majestic stone statue sits peacefully in the museum,
    Tall columns, the ancient courtyard of a serene mosque.
    The setting sun lovingly hangs on the high peak of the pyramid,
    That huge geometric shape of stacked stones, layer upon layer.
    I listen to the sound of camel bells on the sand dunes,
    Deeply and slowly echoing the gentle breeze on the riverbank.
    Like a dream, I ride on the hump of a skinny camel,
    Turning around the upper body of the great "Sphinx" [1].
    Even though the "human face" has been eroded by the ruthless years,
    Its spirit remains heroic, its head still held high.
    It wants to ask the travelers who are deep in thought,
    To answer its difficult "riddle" one by one. [2]
    In front of the great historical site, I feel so small!
    After an era of confusion, I eagerly await clarity!
    Back then, this was built by the hands and feet of hundreds of thousands of slaves!
    Back then, this was a secluded palace for the eternal burial of the "Pharaoh" [3] and his women!
    This secluded palace has become a giant work, one of the "Seven Wonders" of the world,
    It and the blood and sweat of the ancient Egyptian laborers will forever shine!
    I look up, I try my best to circle around this miracle,
    I listen to the constant sound of camel bells on the sand dunes.
    On this land, in the past, there was commercial exchange with the East and the Greeks;
    Later, it was oppressed and invaded by the Roman rulers and generals;
    Even later, for hundreds of years, it was still ruled and occupied by those who came from the West,
    But the river water that nourishes the Egyptian land is permanently clear!
    From ancient times to the present, - the newly opened canal shortens the sea route;
    From the Red Sea to the Mediterranean, this waterway has been cut open, ... [4]
    But how many sacrifices did the Egyptians under heavy pressure make for the canal!
    Time, blood, sweat, hunger and labor,
    And countless lives, ... only then could they watch with their own eyes
    The opening of this passage!
    It’s only been a few years? There are historical sites, records, and bloodstains,
    Also in the memories of the elderly, can it be that
    It can be "breathed" into existence with just pieces of paper and steel?
    Have you not seen Port Said and Cairo with your own eyes!
    The various aspects of the lives of the poor Egyptians there?
    Why are the Egyptians still poor, having opened up the canal for nothing? Why does the "empire's" flag fly in the Egyptian
    sky?
    Why is the power to control this corridor in their hands?
    Towards evening, facing the hot desert wind behind the car window,
    Cairo, farewell! Originally, I wished to stay for ten days.
    This day has given me rich images of the past;
    And a stark picture of the current life!
    Another farewell, I wish you a rebirth under the iron heel!
    Towering pyramids,
    Sphinx,
    Papyrus books had already recorded the wisdom of the predecessors,
    The Nile nurtures your descendants,
    With deep blue affection!
    Hoping that one day we will meet again,
    And see your heroic posture standing tall!
    Note: [1] "Sphinx" is the transliteration of the human-faced lion statue, which is next to the largest pyramid.
    [2] According to ancient legends, this monster with the face of a human and the body of a lion often sat by the roadside, asking travelers to solve riddles, and killing those who could not. Later, Oedipus solved the riddle, and the monster threw itself into the sea and died.
    [3] "Pharaoh" is the title of ancient Egyptian kings.
    [4] One end of the Suez Canal opens from the Gulf of Suez in the Red Sea, and the other end reaches Port Said, which directly enters the Mediterranean Sea.

    游开罗纪感
    （一首未发表的旧诗）
    王统照
    二十多年前我去欧洲时，船过苏伊士运河，曾得一日时间往开罗游览，后在船上草成这首诗，但向未发表，今从旧笔记本上录出刊布，赠与埃及人民。
    雄伟石像安坐于博物院中，
    圆柱高耸，是清真的古寺方庭。
    斜阳恋挂在金字塔的高顶，
    那巨大的几何型的方石叠叠层层。
    我听着沙丘上的驼铃声声，
    沉沉地、缓缓地应和着河岸轻风。
    如同梦境，我骑在瘦驼的背峰，
    转过了大“斯芬克司”〔一〕的上半身形。
    纵然“人面”被无情的岁月剥蚀，
    意态雄杰，她依然昂首挺胸。
    她要把难答解的“谜语”
    向深思的旅客一一问清。〔二〕
    在伟大的古迹前自觉渺小！
    在迷茫的年代后切盼晴明！
    当年，这是几十万劳奴们一手一足的构成！
    当年，这是为永永埋藏着“法老”〔三〕和他女人的
    幽宫！
    这幽宫却变成世界“七奇”的一个巨工，
    它和古埃及劳动者的血汗永放光明！
    我仰望、我绕着这个奇迹尽力环行，
    我听着沙丘上不断的驼铃声声。
    这片土地上，当年与东方、与希腊人的商务交通；
    后来被罗马的执政、将军们的强逼、侵凌；
    更以后，几百年中仍然是从西方来的统治占领，
    可是滋润着埃及国土的河水却永久湛清！
    从古远看到现代，——新开的运河缩短海程；
    从红海到地中海凿开了这一条水上走廊，……〔四〕
    可是在重压下的埃及人为运河拼上了
    多少牺牲！时间、血、汗、饥饿和劳动，
    还有难计数的生命，……才能够眼睁睁
    把这条走廊的便道打通！
    这才多少年？有史迹，有纪录，有血痕，
    也在老年人的回忆之中，难道
    只凭着纸片、钢铁便可以“吹气”呵成？
    您不是亲眼见过了塞得港和开罗城！
    那里的穷苦埃及人的生活种种？
    为甚么埃及人依旧贫困，空空地把
    运河凿通？为甚么“帝国”的军旗飘扬在埃及
    天空？
    为甚么控制这走廊的大权在他们手中？
    向晚，在车窗后面迎着沙漠的热风，
    开罗，告别了！本来我愿有旬日的留踪。
    这一天您给我的是丰富的往古遗影；
    是赤裸裸地当前生活的情景！
    再一声告别，祝您在铁蹄下获得重生！
    巍巍金字塔，
    狮身人面型，
    芦纸书早写下前人的智慧，
    尼罗河乳养着您的后代，
    一碧深情！
    盼望有一天我们重行见面，
    定看见您的雄姿独立峥嵘！
    注：〔一〕“斯芬克司”即人面狮身像之译音，此像在最大的金字塔旁边。
    〔二〕自古代相传此狮身人面的怪物常坐路旁，出谜语令旅客解答，不能者扑杀之。后狄厄帕斯解其谜，此怪遂投海而死云。
    〔三〕“法老”即古代埃及国王的称呼。
    〔四〕苏伊士运河一端从红海的苏伊士湾开口，另一端到直入地中海的塞得港止。
