Wuhan Bridge Construction Site Transfers Forces to Support New Bridge Construction

(Our newspaper's dispatch) Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge Engineering Bureau staff, in building the Yangtze River Bridge, implemented the policy of "Build and Learn" (that is, while building the Yangtze River Bridge, learn advanced Soviet bridge building technology), the bridge-building force has rapidly grown, and began to use the "caisson drilling method" to build the Minjiang Bridge on the Neijiang-Kunming road.

Now, the Fourth Bridge Engineering Division of the Bureau, responsible for the construction of the Minjiang Bridge, has been established. The combined watercraft, water repair boat, large caissons, and some employees to be used in the construction have already sailed to the new construction site; steel cofferdams, large drilling machines, etc. will also be shipped one after another soon.

The Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge Engineering Bureau can draw such a large force to undertake new bridge-building tasks while the Yangtze River Bridge is under intense construction because the Bureau's employees have conscientiously learned from Soviet experts during the bridge construction, and their technical strength has grown rapidly.

Since the Bureau began building the Hanshui Railway Bridge in November 1953, it has successively trained eighty new engineers, more than thirty of whom were young interns who had just graduated from school in 1953. Zhang Zongnai was initially only responsible for pile driving records during his internship at the Hanshui Railway Bridge, and is now the responsible engineer for the construction of a pier of the Yangtze River Bridge. Xiao Chuanren was also a technician when he first arrived at the Hanshui Railway Bridge. He contributed to the specific construction problems of the "caisson drilling method" and became a special advanced producer in Wuhan City, and was promoted to a Level 2, Grade 3 engineer. He was recently promoted to technical director of caisson drilling construction for the Minjiang Bridge. Among the workers, nearly two thousand temporary workers have been transferred to formal workers in recent years, most of whom have reached the level of Grade 3 technicians, and some have even become Grade 4 workers. More than eight hundred demobilized soldiers absorbed last year have now reached at least the level of Grade 2 workers.

### 在建设中培养了大量技术人才  武汉大桥工地抽调力量支援新桥建设

    在建设中培养了大量技术人才
    武汉大桥工地抽调力量支援新桥建设
    本报讯　武汉长江大桥工程局职工，在修建长江大桥时贯彻执行了“建成学会”的方针（即在建成长江大桥的同时学会苏联的先进建桥技术），建桥力量迅速壮大，开始用“管柱钻孔法”修建内（江）昆（明）道路上的岷江大桥。
    现在，该局负责岷江大桥施工的第四桥梁工程处已成立，将在施工中使用的水上联合工作船、水上修配船、大型管柱和部分职工已溯航向新工地前进；钢围囹、大钻机等也将在最近陆续起运。
    武汉长江大桥工程局能在长江大桥正紧张施工的时候抽出这样大的力量担负新的建桥任务，是由于该局职工在大桥施工中，认真向苏联专家学习，技术力量迅速成长起来了。
    该局从1953年11月开始修建汉水铁桥以来，已先后培养出八十名新的工程师，其中有三十多名是1953年才从学校毕业的青年实习生。张宗鼐最初在汉水铁桥实习时，只负责打桩记录工作，现在已成为长江大桥一个桥墩施工的负责工程师。萧传仁初到汉水铁桥也还是个技术员，在“管柱钻孔法”的具体施工问题中作出贡献，成为武汉市的特等先进生产者，并升为三等二级工程师，最近又升为岷江大桥管柱钻孔施工的技术负责人。在工人中，几年来已有将近二千名临时工转为正式工人，其中绝大多数都达到三级技工的水平，有的还成为四级工。去年吸收的八百多名转业军人，现在最低也达到二级工的水平。
