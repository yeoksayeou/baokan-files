    I knew the name of Mr. Sun Yat-sen before the Xinhai Revolution. At that time, the Qing government called Mr. Sun Yat-sen, Chen Shaobai, You ShaoWan and Yang Heling the "Four Great Bandits" and issued arrest warrants everywhere. Many legends about Mr. Sun Yat-sen were circulating among the people. In 1908, I joined the army in Yili, Xinjiang; in 1910, I joined the Tongmenghui (Chinese United League) there. At that time, even remote places like Yili had Tongmenghui organizations, which shows how widely Mr. Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary ideas had spread. In 1911, the Xinhai Revolution broke out, and the New Army stationed in Yili also revolted in response. This was the first time I participated in the democratic revolution under the leadership and influence of Mr. Sun Yat-sen. In 1913, we responded to the "Second Revolution" launched by Mr. Sun Yat-sen (against Yuan Shikai) in Yili. After the failure, I arrived in Shaanxi in 1914 via Siberia. Later, I followed the revolutionary predecessors in the Northwest and participated in the "Protect the Constitution Movement," the struggle against the Northern Warlords, and the Northern Expedition under the leadership of Mr. Sun Yat-sen. Although I never had the opportunity to receive personal guidance from Mr. Sun Yat-sen during his lifetime, Mr. Sun Yat-sen's great personality and revolutionary spirit have left an indelible impression on my heart. I remember in 1920, when the domestic situation was very chaotic, Mr. Sun Yat-sen wrote me a letter, encouraging us in the Northwest to unite comrades and carry the revolutionary banner to the end. I still keep this letter as an unforgettable memento.
    Although Mr. Sun Yat-sen never visited the Northwest in his lifetime, he was always very concerned about the democratic revolutionary cause in the Northwest region. Mr. Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary ideas also had a far-reaching impact in the Northwest region. As far as I know, before the Xinhai Revolution, the Tongmenghui organization in the Northwest was established with Shaanxi as its center, actively advocating revolution. The Jianben School, founded by Tongmenghui members in Shaanxi, once cultivated a group of revolutionary youths. Among the Tongmenghui members in the Northwest at that time, the most valued by Mr. Sun Yat-sen were Jing Wumu and Hu Jingyi. Under the instructions of Mr. Sun Yat-sen, they carried out revolutionary activities in the Northwest and were highly regarded at the time. Unfortunately, Jing Wumu was killed by bandits in 1918, and Hu Jingyi also died of illness not long after Mr. Sun Yat-sen passed away. This is very regrettable.
    The Northwest Jingguo Army and the National Army were also established successively under the leadership and with the help of Mr. Sun Yat-sen. The Jingguo Army was formed in Sanyuan, Shaanxi in 1917, and the leaders were Jing Wumu and Hu Jingyi. Its purpose was to support Mr. Sun Yat-sen's "Protect the Constitution" military government and oppose the Northern Warlords. It played an active role in the revolutionary cause in the Northwest at that time. It later became the predecessor of the Second Army of the National Army. The National Army was formed in 1924, with Feng Yuxiang as the commander-in-chief and Hu Jingyi and Sun Yue as the deputy commanders-in-chief. Most of its Second Army were soldiers from the Northwest. The alliance of Feng Yuxiang, Hu Jingyi, and Sun Yue was facilitated by Mr. Sun Yat-sen. At its peak, the National Army controlled several provinces in the north, defeated the Zhili warlords, and welcomed Mr. Sun Yat-sen to the north to preside over national affairs. Mr. Sun Yat-sen replied to Feng Yuxiang, Hu Jingyi, and Sun Yue: "The righteous flag has been raised, the great evil has been eradicated, and all of you have contributed to the country, which I deeply celebrate. The plans for national construction are about to be decided, and I plan to go north immediately to meet with you and discuss them." In 1924, Mr. Sun Yat-sen went north while ill, but due to the stimulation of Duan Qirui's counter-revolutionary activities, he was distressed and fell ill, eventually passing away. In the period after Mr. Sun Yat-sen's death, the National Army continued to implement Mr. Sun Yat-sen's three major policies of alliance with Russia, alliance with the Communist Party, and assistance to peasants and workers, and participated in the Northern Expedition, making considerable contributions. However, when Chiang Kai-shek betrayed the revolution and implemented a divisive policy towards the National Army, serious divisions also occurred within the National Army, and it finally compromised with the counter-revolutionary forces, leading itself to the path of demise. In particular, the Second Army of the National Army became increasingly divided internally after Hu Jingyi's death. At this critical juncture, it was even more indecisive, resulting in a major mistake, a complete defeat, and failing to live up to Mr. Sun Yat-sen's initial earnest expectations.
    From the Xinhai Revolution to the Northern Expedition, although the democratic revolutionary cause in the Northwest experienced many setbacks, the struggle did not stop. Especially after the failure of the National Army, the responsibility of leading the revolution was bravely undertaken by the Chinese Communist Party, which made the revolutionary struggle in the Northwest region show an unprecedented breadth and depth. Many comrades who insisted on revolution, especially the Communist Party members, continued to struggle in extremely difficult environments. The seeds of revolution were finally sown in the Northwest and continued to grow and strengthen. Mr. Sun Yat-sen's efforts for the democratic revolutionary cause in the Northwest region and the bloodshed and sacrifice of many revolutionary martyrs have after all yielded valuable gains.
    Mr. Sun Yat-sen devoted his life to tirelessly exploring the path to save the country and the people, and although he experienced many twists and turns, he never wavered. Due to the influence of the great Russian October Socialist Revolution and the great May Fourth Movement, Mr. Sun Yat-sen finally found a clear direction in the tortuous revolutionary process. From then on, Mr. Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary thought developed to a new and higher stage. Mr. Sun Yat-sen deeply realized that "without taking Russia as a teacher, there will be no achievements in the revolution from now on"; realized that it was necessary to adopt the policy of uniting with the Communist Party, reorganize the Chinese Kuomintang, and expel stubborn elements who opposed the policy of allying with the Communist Party; realized that "the national revolutionary movement must rely on the participation of farmers and workers throughout the country before it can be decisive... In essence, fighting for the farmers and workers is also fighting for the farmers and workers themselves"; therefore, Mr. Sun Yat-sen bravely decided on the three major policies of alliance with Russia, alliance with the Communist Party, and assistance to peasants and workers, and reinterpreted the Three Principles of the People based on the revolutionary spirit of the three major policies, explicitly proposing a program of opposing imperialism and opposing feudalism. Mr. Sun Yat-sen's three major policies reflected the urgent wishes of the Chinese people at that time and played a huge role in promoting the development of the Chinese revolution. I remember that when the National Army implemented the three major policies, a vigorous new atmosphere emerged in all aspects. The Soviet advisory group headed by Usman Kakharov sincerely and selflessly helped the National Army plan the revolutionary struggle. Many Communist Party members participated in the work of the National Army and became the backbone. Comrade Liu Bojian, a Communist Party member, served as the deputy director of the political department of the National Army Headquarters; Li Dazhao, one of the founders of the Chinese Communist Party, also maintained close contact with the National Army. After Li Dazhao was killed, the National Army Headquarters held a memorial meeting. The people also used great efforts to support the National Army. At that time, the National Army was able to continuously achieve victories, which proved the infinite vitality of the three major policies. Once the National Army abandoned Mr. Sun Yat-sen's three major policies, it would inevitably embark on the path of decline. From here, I sincerely admire Mr. Sun Yat-sen's great revolutionary foresight, which is inseparable from Mr. Sun Yat-sen's lifelong pursuit of truth and constant progress. "Adapt to the trend of the world and meet the needs of the people," this is Mr. Sun Yat-sen's great spirit, and it is also what we should learn most.
    In commemorating the 90th anniversary of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's birth, the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, have not only completed the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal democratic revolution, but also achieved a decisive victory in the socialist revolution; various construction undertakings are accelerating, and the first five-year plan is about to be successfully completed; a great new China has emerged in the world and has formed an unbreakable alliance with the great Soviet Union. Mr. Sun Yat-sen's lifelong pursuit of revolutionary ideals has been fully realized. The revolutionary faction of the Kuomintang, founded by Mr. Sun Yat-sen, has long participated in the people's democratic united front and is contributing its strength to the socialist cause. Many comrades who followed Mr. Sun Yat-sen in the revolution back then, although now with white hair and wrinkled faces, are still serving the people with vigor. All these are the greatest comfort to Mr. Sun Yat-sen; if Mr. Sun Yat-sen knew in the afterlife, he should be smiling!
    In commemorating the 90th anniversary of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's birth, I cannot help but think that Taiwan has not yet been liberated, and I cannot help but think of the Kuomintang military and political personnel in Taiwan now, especially some old friends who once followed Mr. Sun Yat-sen. I think they must be filled with emotion on this holiday. If they have not forgotten their original intention of following Mr. Sun Yat-sen in the revolution, have not forgotten Mr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings, they should recognize the general trend of today, where the hearts of the people are directed, turn back as soon as possible, abandon darkness and seek light, and strive to make contributions to the peaceful liberation of Taiwan. Only in this way can they truly be worthy of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's expectations of them back then.

    追念中山先生
    邓宝珊
    我知道中山先生的名字，是在辛亥革命以前。那时候，清政府把先生同陈少白、尤少纨、杨鹤龄称为“四大寇”，到处悬赏通缉，而在民间也流传着关于先生的许多传说。1908年，我从军到新疆伊犁；1910年在那里参加了同盟会。当时像伊犁那样边远的地方都有同盟会的组织，足见先生革命主张传播之广了。1911年，辛亥革命爆发，驻在伊犁的新军也起义响应。这是我第一次在先生的领导和影响下参加了民主主义革命的斗争。1913年，我们又在伊犁响应中山先生发动的二次革命（反对袁世凯），失败后，我取道西伯利亚于1914年到达陕西。以后我就追随西北的革命前辈，在中山先生领导下，参加过护法、反对北洋军阀和北伐战争。中山先生在世的时候，我虽然始终没有得到面聆教诲的机会，但是先生的伟大人格和革命精神，一直在我心里留下不可磨灭的印象。记得在1920年，正当国内局势十分混乱的时候，中山先生曾经写给我一封信，勉励我们在西北团结同志，把革命旗帜坚持到底。这封信我至今还保存着，作为一个难忘的纪念。
    中山先生一生虽然没有到过西北，但是对于西北地区的民主主义革命事业始终是非常关心的。中山先生的革命主张在西北地区的影响也是深远的。据我知道，早在辛亥革命以前，西北的同盟会组织就以陕西为中心建立起来，积极鼓吹革命。由同盟会员在陕西创办的健本学校，曾经培养了一批革命青年。在当时西北的同盟会员中，最为中山先生器重的是井勿幕和胡景翼。他们受中山先生的指示，在西北进行革命活动，为一时物望所归。不幸井勿幕于1918年被匪徒杀害，胡景翼也在中山先生逝世后不久病故。这是很可惋惜的。
    西北靖国军和国民军也是在中山先生的领导和帮助下先后建立的。靖国军于1917年在陕西三原组成，领导人是井勿幕和胡景翼，它的宗旨是拥护中山先生的护法军政府，反对北洋军阀，对于当时西北的革命事业，曾经起过积极作用。它后来就成为国民军第二军的前身。国民军于1924年组成，总司令是冯玉祥，副总司令是胡景翼和孙岳。它的第二军大部分是西北子弟兵。冯玉祥、胡景翼、孙岳的联合，是由中山先生从中促成的。国民军在声势最盛的时候，曾经控制过北方的好几个省份，打败了直系军阀，并且欢迎中山先生北上主持国家大计。中山先生给冯玉祥、胡景翼、孙岳的复电说：“义旗聿举，大憝肃清，诸兄功在国家，同深庆幸，建设大计，即欲决定，拟即日北上，与诸兄晤商。”1924年，中山先生抱病北上，但是由于受到段祺瑞反革命活动的刺激，忧愤疾发，竟至不起。在中山先生逝世以后的一个时期内，国民军继续执行中山先生的联苏、联共、扶助工农的三大政策，并且参加了北伐战争，有过相当的贡献。但是，当蒋介石背叛革命，并且对国民军实行分化政策的时候，国民军内部也发生了严重的分裂，终于同反革命势力妥协，使自己走上了复灭的道路，尤其是国民军第二军，在胡景翼病故后，内部日益分歧，到了这个紧要关头，更是举棋不定，结果铸成大错，一败涂地，辜负了中山先生当初的殷切期望。
    从辛亥革命到北伐战争期间，西北的民主主义革命事业虽然经历了许多的挫折，但是斗争并没有中断，特别是从国民军失败以后，领导革命的责任是由中国共产党勇敢地担当起来了，这就使得西北地区的革命斗争表现出前所未有的广泛性和深刻性。不少坚持革命的同志，特别是共产党员，在万分艰苦的环境里继续进行斗争。革命的种子终于在西北播下了，而且不断的成长和壮大起来。中山先生对于西北地区民主主义革命事业的一番心血，许多革命先烈的流血牺牲，毕竟是有宝贵收获的。
    中山先生的一生，始终不懈的在摸索救国救民的道路，虽然历经波折，毫不动摇。由于伟大的俄国十月社会主义革命和伟大的“五四”运动的影响，中山先生终于在迂回曲折的革命进程中找到了明确的方向。从此以后，中山先生的革命思想就发展到新的更高的阶段。中山先生深刻体会到“今后之革命，非以俄为师，断无成就”；体会到必须采取联合共产党的政策，改组中国国民党，并且把反对联共政策的顽固分子开除出党；体会到“国民革命之运动，必恃全国农夫工人之参加，然后可以决胜……质言之，即为农夫工人而奋斗，亦即农夫工人为自身而奋斗”；因而中山先生就勇敢地决定联苏、联共、扶助工农的三大政策，并且根据三大政策的革命精神重新解释三民主义，明确提出反对帝国主义反对封建主义的政纲。中山先生的三大政策，反应了当时中国人民的迫切愿望，对于中国革命的发展，是起了巨大推动作用的。记得国民军在执行三大政策的时候，各方面都出现了蓬蓬勃勃的新气象。以乌斯曼谖夫为首的苏联顾问团，真诚无私地帮助国民军策划革命斗争。许多共产党员参加了国民军的工作，并且成为骨干。共产党员刘伯坚同志担任过国民军总司令部政治部副主任；中国共产党创始人之一李大钊同志也同国民军保持密切的联系，在李大钊同志被害以后，国民军总司令部曾经开会追悼。人民群众也用很大力量来支援国民军。当时国民军能够不断取得胜利，正是证明了三大政策的无限生命力。而国民军一旦背弃了中山先生的三大政策，也就必然走上没落的道路。从这里，我衷心敬佩中山先生的伟大的革命远见，这种革命远见，又是同中山先生毕生追求真理，不断进步的精神分不开的。“适乎世界之潮流，合乎人群之需要”，这就是中山先生的伟大精神，也正是最值得我们学习的地方。
    在纪念中山先生诞辰九十周年的时候，中国人民，在中国共产党和毛泽东主席领导下，不但已经完成了反帝反封建的民主主义革命任务，而且已经取得社会主义革命的决定性胜利；各项建设事业正在加速发展，第一个五年计划就要胜利完成；一个伟大的新中国已经出现于世界，并且同伟大的苏联结成了牢不可破的联盟。中山先生毕生追求的革命理想，已经全部实现了。中山先生手创的国民党的革命派，早已参加了人民民主统一战线，正在为社会主义事业贡献自己的力量。当年追随中山先生从事革命的许多同志，今天虽已白发苍颜，仍然精神矍铄地为人民服务。所有这些，都是对中山先生的最大安慰；先生地下有知，应该是含笑瞑目了吧！
    在纪念中山先生诞辰九十周年的时候，我不能不想到台湾还没有解放，也不能不想到现在台湾的国民党军政人员，特别是一些曾经追随过中山先生的老朋友。我想他们在这个节日里，一定是感慨万端的。如果他们没有忘记当年追随中山先生参加革命的初衷，没有忘记中山先生的遗教，就应当认清今天的大势所趋，人心所向，及早回头，弃暗投明，争取为和平解放台湾立功，这样才真正无愧于中山先生当年对他们的期望。
