    Talking About Dominating Leisure Time
    Bai Liao
    In institutions of higher education, the past practice of rigidly arranging all of students' study and life time, even to the extent of issuing detailed schedules, to some extent affected the quality of students' learning and suppressed the development of individual talents. University students have different foundations, interests, hobbies, and physical conditions, and the time needed to review each course is naturally different. Rigidly imposing the same requirements on every student inevitably produces undesirable results. Students who are relatively weak in a particular course still find it insufficient to review according to the prescribed time, resulting in a shallow and incomplete grasp of that course, even failing to meet the minimum requirements. Students who have some foundation in a particular course can spend less time reviewing, but due to the regulations, they have to spend more unnecessary time to avoid criticism. The original purpose of regulating all of students' study and life time was to require students to develop in an all-round way, but in reality, it had the effect of requiring balanced development. Students cannot arrange their leisure time for study and life according to their specific circumstances, which makes it impossible to develop personal interests and strengths on the basis of all-round development, and the cultivation of independent working ability will naturally be limited to a certain extent. Since the beginning of this semester, institutions of higher education, in order to better implement the educational policy of all-round development, have handed over leisure time to students for free allocation, which is a timely and important approach.
    Free allocation of leisure time means allowing university students to plan, rationally, and flexibly use their leisure time according to their coursework and other conditions, to study and exercise, and to better cultivate their independent working ability in order to adapt to the needs of national construction. University students generally have a high degree of self-awareness, so this requirement is appropriate and should be. After the implementation of the free allocation of leisure time method, it has been welcomed by the vast majority of students, greatly enlivened students' study and life, and enabled students to achieve more significant results in learning their major well and promoting their physical and mental health. On the basis of self-awareness, students deliberately cherish their leisure time and take their studies seriously. Many students have not only relatively alleviated the excessive mental tension caused by heavy coursework in the past, but also expanded and deepened their knowledge, and have more convenience in the study of political current affairs and the arrangement of recreational and sports activities.
    The problem now is that some students misunderstand the meaning of freely allocating leisure time. They think that so-called freely allocating leisure time means that they can use leisure time casually. They waste time aimlessly and uselessly. Besides attending classes, some sleep willfully, and some chat and wander around. They study carelessly, live sloppily, and even hinder the normal study and rest of the majority of students. If someone offers them suggestions or criticisms, they will say that it interferes with their "freedom" and restricts or harms their "personality" and "interests." Under the pretext of "freely allocating leisure time," they do not participate in some collective activities that should be participated in, and they also relax their physical exercise. This is obviously wrong. It should be imagined, how can they complete their learning tasks if they continue to be so casual? How can they cultivate themselves to become talents with both moral integrity and ability, and healthy bodies, needed for the construction of the motherland? The school is a place for collective learning and living. If one pursues personal willful "freedom" and does not abide by some necessary disciplines and systems of the school, and the useless behavior of a few people hinders the study and life of the majority, should it be allowed? It can be believed that such an extremely simple truth should be understood by everyone.
    At the same time, another small number of students have gone to another extreme. Some students devote all their leisure time to studying, neglecting necessary physical exercise and recreational activities. This approach violates the principle of all-round development and is obviously wrong. Moreover, some students read too greedily, finding many books to read, but they cannot digest them; others do not give much thought to their learning situation, and choose elective courses inappropriately based on momentary pleasure, resulting in becoming busy and confused again.
    The reasons for the above unhealthy phenomena are multifaceted, but mainly: some students do not have a sufficient understanding of the significance of the new measure of freely allocating leisure time; or, some of them are not good at arranging their own time. In addition, how to use leisure time for independent research and independent work has not been well resolved among some students. After the implementation of the new measures, the school leadership did not promote them well in a timely manner, and many students had just come from middle school and were still unfamiliar with how to study in university and were not good at arranging their own time, which is understandable.
    To change this unhealthy phenomenon, it is required that the school administration, Party organizations, Youth League organizations, and student unions, focus on practical problems and specifically study solutions, further clarify the meaning of freely allocating leisure time to students, guide students to correctly allocate time, and not waste time. Class cadres in institutions of higher education should face up to the current difficulties in their work, overcome the rigid and generalized shortcomings of past work methods, actively support those students who cherish time, study hard, and pay attention to safeguarding public interests; at the same time, adopt individual persuasion and education methods to persuade and guide some students who do not study seriously and do not cherish time, and help them plan and rationally arrange their leisure time.
    Correctly allocating leisure time is a crucial link for university students to cultivate their independent working ability. Every university student should consciously master time, be good at being the master of time, not waste their precious time, cherish their valuable university life, and cultivate themselves into talents who can be competent for the cause of national construction.

    谈谈支配课余时间
    白辽
    在高等学校里，过去硬性安排学生全部学习和生活的时间，甚至采取发指示图表的办法，在一定程度上影响了学生的学习质量，并且抑制了个性特长的发展。大学生学习的基础、兴趣、爱好以及身体条件等等，都不一样，对每门课程需要的复习时间当然也不一样。硬性地对每个学生都提出同样的要求，必然会产生不好的结果。对某一门课程学习比较差的学生，按照规定的时间去复习，还嫌不够，以致对那门课程掌握得不深不透，甚至达不到最低限度的要求。对某一门课程有些基础的学生，可以少花时间去复习，但是限于规定，为了免受批评，只好也多花不必要的时间。规定学生全部学习和生活的时间的目的，本来在于要求学生全面发展，而实际上却起了要求平均发展的作用。学生们不能根据自己的具体情况安排课余的学习和生活，也就无法在全面发展的基础上发展个人的兴趣和特长，独立工作能力的培养自然会受到一定的限制。这学期开学以来，各高等学校为了更好地贯彻全面发展的教育方针，把课余时间交给学生自由支配，是一个及时而重要的做法。
    自由支配课余时间，就是让大学生们根据自己的课业情况和其他条件，有计划地、合理地并且灵活地利用课余时间，进行学习和锻炼，更好地培养自己的独立工作能力，以适应祖国建设的需要。大学生们一般都有很高的自觉性，这样对他们要求是合适的、应该的。自由支配课余时间的办法实行以后，受到了绝大多数学生的欢迎，大大活跃了学生的学习生活，使学生在学好自己的专业并有利于身心健康的发展方面，获得了更加显著的成绩。学生在自觉的基础上，加意地爱惜课余时间，认真地对待学习。许多学生不仅相对地减轻了以往因为课业过重而在精神上引起的过分紧张，而且也扩大并加深了所学的知识，在政治时事的学习和文娱体育活动的安排上也有了更多的方便。
    现在的问题是，有一部分学生误解了自由支配课余时间的意义。他们认为所谓自由支配课余时间就是可以随便乱用课余时间。他们无计划地、无益地消耗时间，除了上课以外，有的任性地睡觉，有的谈天、闲逛。他们学习马虎，生活散漫，甚至妨害了多数学生的正常的学习和休息。如果有人对他们提出建议或批评，他们会说干涉了他们的“自由”，使他们的“个性”和“兴趣”受到限制或伤害。他们在“自由支配课余时间”的借口下，一些应该参加的集体活动也不参加了，身体的锻炼也放松了。这显然是不对的。应该设想，他们长此散漫下去，如何能完成学习任务？如何能培养自己成为德才兼备、身体健康的祖国建设所需要的人？学校是一个集体学习和生活的场所，如果为了追求个人任性的“自由”，而不遵守学校的一些必要的纪律和制度，少数人的无益的行为妨害了多数人的学习和生活，是应该容许的么？可以相信，这样极为浅显的道理，应该为大家所了解的。
    在这同时，另外的少部分学生走向了另一个极端。有的学生把课余时间完全用在学习上，而把必要的体育锻炼和文娱活动抛弃不管。这种做法违背了全面发展的原则，显然也是不对的。况且，有的学生读书贪多，找了许多书籍阅读，可是消化不了；有的对自己的学习情况不多加考虑，凭一时高兴，不适当地选读选修课，结果又忙乱起来。
    产生上述不健康现象的原因是多方面的，但主要是：有些学生对自由支配课余时间这一新措施的意义还认识不足；或者，他们中有的还不善于自己安排时间。另外，究竟如何利用课余时间进行独立钻研和独立工作，在一些学生中也还没有很好地解决。新措施实行以后，学校领导方面没有及时很好地宣传，而学生中又有许多刚来自中学，对于如何在大学里学习还很生疏，不善于自己安排时间，这是可以理解的。
    要改变这种不健康的现象，就要求学校行政方面、党组织、青年团组织和学生会，针对实际问题，具体研究解决，要向学生进一步说清楚自由支配课余时间的意义，引导学生去正确支配时间，不要浪费时间。高等学校学生中的班干部们，应该正视目前工作中的困难，克服过去工作方式生硬和一般化的毛病，积极地支持那些爱惜时间、认真学习并注意维护公共利益的学生；同时采取个别说服教育的方式，对一些学习不认真、不爱惜时间的学生，进行劝导，并帮助他们有计划地合理地安排课余时间。
    正确地支配课余时间，是大学生们培养独立工作能力的带有关键性的一环。每一个大学生都应该自觉地掌握时间，善于作时间的主人，不要把大好光阴浪费过去，珍惜可贵的大学生活，把自己培养成为能够胜任祖国建设事业的人才。
