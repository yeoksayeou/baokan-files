    London Newspapers' Complaints About the United States
    By Pan Fei, Our Correspondent in London
    Britain has once again brazenly rejected the United Nations' call for British troops to withdraw from Egypt. Yesterday, over a hundred Conservative Members of Parliament submitted a motion in the House of Commons, "congratulating the Foreign Secretary on his efforts to secure international control of the Suez Canal" and "attacking the United Nations' resolution demanding the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of British and French troops from Egypt."
    Acting Prime Minister Butler told "Newsweek" that, "Frankly, anyone who thinks that British troops will be completely withdrawn after today is mistaken." Butler demanded that the United Nations should first change its attitude.
    As Britain becomes increasingly mired in the Suez Canal crisis, the contradictions between Britain and the United States become increasingly apparent. Since Sunday, some British politicians and newspapers have been loudly attacking the United States' policy on the Suez issue. The motion of the Conservative Members of Parliament mentioned above also openly attacks "the attitude of the United States," accusing the United States of "seriously damaging the Atlantic Alliance." It is also worth noting that since Sunday, almost all right-wing newspapers have been attacking the United States. The attacks are not only limited to Dulles and the State Department, but also indirectly attack Eisenhower himself. The "Yorkshire Post" said: For months, the U.S. authorities have been following a course that has greatly disturbed Britain. This course was followed even before the British and French intervention in Egypt. Dulles is the main character, but he would not dare to do this without the support of the President. The newspaper's London editor specifically reported on the advertisements on the newsstands in Fleet Street, which highlighted an article in the London "Evening Standard" titled: "Ike, Friend or Foe?" He wrote: "This sign is very eye-catching," and added: "But what is disturbing is the undisguised spirit that makes its content clear to passersby." "The Times" said in an editorial: "The position taken by the United States at this stage - abstaining from the moderate Belgian proposal, but voting in favor of 'immediate' withdrawal - has aroused anti-American sentiment at a time when the United States itself is pursuing a wrong or dangerous path."
    These fierce attacks on the United States reveal the sharp contradictions between the competing blocs of these two Western countries, and Britain's anti-American propaganda also shows that Britain is trying to put pressure on the United States, telling it: "Don't bully us too much." Everyone knows that the United States has several trump cards to defeat its British opponent. The first trump card is that the United States intends to support the Asian-African group in the United Nations. But in reality, its purpose is to squeeze British and French interests out of the Middle East. The second trump card is oil. The British lack oil, but the Americans are dangling oil in front of them as bait. The British of course know this trick. U.S. oil monopoly capital intends to use oil to extract even greater profits from its allies, and to further weaken the competitive strength of its overseas rivals. The London "Times" exposed this trick of Britain's opponent. It revealed yesterday: that the United States' "more positive support" for the views of the Asian-African group is intended to simultaneously "derive any practical benefit possible from the reduction of British and French prestige."

### 伦敦报纸对美国的怨声

    伦敦报纸对美国的怨声
    本报驻伦敦记者　潘非
    英国又一次悍然拒绝了联合国要求英军撤出埃及的呼吁。昨天，百余名保守党议员在下院提出提案，“祝贺外交大臣争取国际管制苏伊士运河的努力”，并“攻击联合国要求英、法军队立即无条件撤出埃及的决议。”
    代理首相巴特勒对美国“新闻周刊”发表谈话说：“我老实说，谁要是认为在今天之后英国军队将会全部撤退的话，那他就错了。”巴特勒要求联合国首先应该改变态度。
    随着英国的愈来愈深地陷于苏伊士运河危机的泥沼中，英美之间的矛盾日益明显。自星期日以来，一部分英国政治家和报纸已经在大声攻击美国对苏伊士问题的政策。上面所提到保守党议员的提案，同样公开地攻击“美国的态度”，指责美国的“严重损害大西洋联盟”。还值得注意的是，自星期日以来，几乎全部右翼报纸都在攻击美国。攻击并不只是限于杜勒斯和国务院，而且拐弯抹角地攻击到艾森豪威尔的身上来。“约克郡邮报”说：数月来美国当局一直追随着一条使英国大为不安的路线。早在英、法对埃及的干涉以前就遵循着这条路线了。杜勒斯是其中的主角，但是没有总统的支持，他是不敢这样干的。该报的伦敦编辑特别报道了在舰队街的报摊招牌上的广告，该广告标出了伦敦“晚报”的一篇文章，题目是：“艾克，友乎敌乎？”他写道：“这个招牌十分醒目”，又说：“但是使人不安的是这种直言无隐的气魄，使得行人们对其内容一目了然。”“泰晤士报”在社论里说：“美国在这个阶段上所采取的立场——对温和的比利时提案弃权，却投票赞成‘立即’撤军，在美国自己追随着错误或危险道路的时候，引起了反美的觉醒。”
    这些对美国的猛烈攻击揭露了这两个西方国家的竞争集团之间的尖锐矛盾，而英国的这种反美宣传也表明了，英国正在力图向美国施加压力，告诉它说：“别欺负我们太甚。”谁都知道，美国手里有几张打败它的英国对手的王牌。第一张王牌是，美国打算在联合国里支持亚非集团。但是实际上，其目的是从中东把英、法利益排挤出去。第二张王牌是石油。英国人缺乏石油，美国人却在他们面前拿着石油来做钓饵。英国人当然晓得这个诡计。美国石油垄断资本打算借着石油从盟友身上攫取得更丰厚的利润，并且更进一步削弱它海外对手的竞争力量。伦敦“泰晤士报”揭穿了英国的对手的这个花招。它昨天揭露说：美国对亚非集团的意见的“更加肯定的支持”，是打算同时“从英、法威信的降低中取得可能得到的任何实际利益。”（28日）
