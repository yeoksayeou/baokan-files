    A Hoarder

    This summer, ramie was in short supply in Shaoxing City, Zhejiang Province, and surrounding areas. The city's department store, seeing the tight supply in the market, treated its inventory of over 10,000 jin of ramie as a treasure, storing it in the warehouse. At the same time, it asked the city's Industry and Commerce Bureau to raise the selling price, hoping to profit from it. When the Industry and Commerce Bureau refused to raise the price, the city's department store shelved the ramie and refused to sell it, letting the market run out.

    The county purchasing bureau, seeing that ramie had been out of stock in the market for a long time, asked the higher authorities to allocate goods. When the city department store found out, it immediately took the lead and rushed to Ningbo to extract 20,000 jin of ramie, and according to plan, it transferred 20,000 jin from Sichuan. However, not a single strand of ramie could be seen on the Shaoxing market, because the pricing did not meet the "ideal" of the city department store.

    At this time, a notice came from the higher authorities, saying that all hemp should be transferred to the local supply and marketing cooperative for wholesale, and instructed to complete the handover procedures immediately.

    Deputy Manager Sun of the city department store read the instructions from the higher authorities word by word, his hands trembling, and he kept saying, "That's terrible, 30,000 yuan of business is about to fly away." Suddenly, his gloomy face brightened again: The document clearly stated that the receiving unit was Shaoxing City Supply and Marketing Cooperative. Anyway, the city cooperative has not yet been established. If I sell the hemp, what can old Sun do to me?

    But things often don't go as planned. It turned out that the receiving unit was written incorrectly in the notice from the higher authorities, "county" was written as "city."

    Upon receiving this notice, the county supply and marketing cooperative immediately sent people to the company to discuss the handover. Under the "instructions" of Manager Sun, Comrade Hu in charge raised two difficulties to the comrades of the supply and marketing cooperative:

    At first, Comrade Hu claimed that the city party committee's finance and trade department did not agree to hand it over to the county cooperative. Later, Deputy Director Ma of the city party committee's finance and trade department said orally: It should be divided according to the supply ratio between the city and the county.

    Then the second difficulty was raised: the handover date should be four days later. Why did the company want to delay the handover date? It turned out that there was a lot to it: under the instructions of Deputy Manager Sun, the city department store seized these few days, made phone calls and issued instructions overnight, trying to sell this batch of ramie to the market. Five thousand jin were allocated to one production team in Sunduan Town at once, and another five thousand jin were dispersed and stored in the companies below.

    There are more than 600,000 farmers in the rural areas of Shaoxing, with 15 supply and marketing cooperatives. The department store only left 3,000 jin of ramie to be transferred to the county supply and marketing cooperative, and tore off the labels of the second-grade, second-class yellow hemp, pretending to be the first-grade, first-class yellow hemp and handing it over to the supply and marketing cooperative.

    People can't help but ask: What is Deputy Manager Sun's calculation in this matter?

    一个囤积居奇者
    今年夏天，浙江绍兴市和附近地区的苧麻缺货。市百货公司见到市场上供应紧张，就把库存的一万多斤苧麻，当活宝一样摆在仓库里；一面却要求市工商局提高售价，想从中捞一把。工商局不同意提高价格，市百货公司就把麻搁而不卖，任凭市场脱销。
    县采购局鉴于市场上苧麻长久脱销，要求上级调货。市百货公司知道了，立即捷足先登跑到宁波提取了二万斤苧麻，并按计划向四川调来了二万斤。可是绍兴市场上仍然看不到一根麻丝，因为定价不合市百货公司的“理想”。
    正在这个时候，上级来了个通知，说麻类全部移交给当地供销合作社批发，并指示立即办理接交手续。
    市百货公司的孙副经理一字一句地读着上级的指示，手直打哆嗦，嘴里还不住地说：“那还了得，眼看三万元的业务又飞了。”忽然，那付阴沉的脸又开朗了：文中明明写着接收单位是绍兴市供销合作社，反正市社还没成立，把麻卖掉，能把我老孙怎么样？
    但事情往往不是那么如意的。原来上级那份通知中把接收单位写错了，把“县”写成“市”了。
    县供销社接到这份通知，马上就派人去公司研究接交问题。在孙经理的“指示”下，经办的胡同志向供销社的同志提出了两个难题：
    开始，胡同志推说市委财贸部不同意交给县社。后来，市委财贸部马副部长口示：应按市县供应比重划分。
    接着又提出了第二个难题：接交日期应在四天以后。为什么公司要拖延接交日期呢？原来这里大有文章：市百货公司在孙副经理指示下，抓紧这几天时间，连夜打电话，发指示，设法把这批苧麻向市场投售，仅孙端镇一个生产小组，一下子就拨去了五千斤，并分散存放到下边的公司五千斤。
    绍兴农村有六十多万农民，有十五个供销社，百货公司只留三千斤苧麻移交给县供销社，而且把二等二级黄麻的标签撕掉，冒充一等一级黄麻交给供销社。
    人们不得不问：孙副经理在这件事情上打的是什么算盘？
