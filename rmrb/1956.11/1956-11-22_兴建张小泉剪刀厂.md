Construction of Zhang Xiaoquan Scissors Factory

(Our report) The Zhang Xiaoquan Scissors Factory in Hangzhou has begun construction in the garden area of Daguan Bridge in Hangzhou.

The famous Hangzhou Zhang Xiaoquan scissors have a long history. In the past, they were all handmade, and production was scattered, resulting in low efficiency. After the collectivization of the scissors industry, favorable conditions were provided for the transition to mechanization. The Hangzhou Zhang Xiaoquan Scissors Factory, which is currently under construction, will have workshops for blank making, cold working, finishing, and electroplating. Except for the steel inlaying process, which will still be done manually, other processes will generally use machines to replace manual labor. After the factory is completed and put into production in the first quarter of next year, more than 500 cooperative members of scissors production cooperatives in the city will become workers in this factory.

    兴建张小泉剪刀厂
    本报讯　杭州市张小泉剪刀厂已在杭州市大关桥花园内动工兴建。
    著名的杭州张小泉剪刀，有悠久的历史。过去都用手工操作，又是分散生产，效率不高。剪刀业合作化以后，给向机械化过渡提供了有利条件。目前动工兴建的杭州张小泉剪刀厂将设有制坯、冷作、白工和电镀等车间，除了镶钢工序仍用手工操作外，其他将普遍利用机器来代替手工操作。这个厂明年第一季度建成投入生产后，全市五百多个剪刀生产合作社社员将成为这个厂的工人。
