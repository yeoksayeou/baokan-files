    At the National Congress of Active Elements in Socialist Construction of Revolutionary Martyrs' Families, Military Dependents, Disabled Veterans, and Demobilized Soldiers, the reporter interviewed Li Qingshan, the representative of disabled veterans from Liaoning Province. He is a specially disabled veteran who is blind in both eyes, has lost his left hand, and is deaf in one ear. He currently serves as the Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Branch of the Local State-Owned Chemical Factory in Tieling County, Liaoning Province.

    In the winter of 1953, Li Qingshan was seriously injured on the west coast of Korea. At that time, he was twenty-two years old and a platoon leader in the Chinese People's Volunteers. In a coma, he was sent to a rear hospital. When he woke up and realized he had lost his eyes and a left hand, he thought everything was over. He was very distressed and had thoughts of suicide. The Party Branch Secretary of the hospital said to him, "I am also disabled, we are the same. There is only one correct path before us, and that is the path taken by Pavel Korchagin and Wu Yunduo." Nurses and hospital staff would read "How the Steel Was Tempered" and "Dedicate Everything to the Party" to him whenever they had time. Two or three months passed. Li Qingshan thought that the Party had cultivated him, a child who used to collect coal cinders, into an officer, which was not easy. He should continue to work for the Party. He also thought that he had studied for three years when he was a child, and after joining the revolutionary army, his cultural level had improved to the level of a senior primary school graduate. As long as he worked hard, he could also become a useful person like Pavel Korchagin and Wu Yunduo. From then on, he began to practice writing, practicing every day along the horizontal grids made of cardboard. After a few months, he was proficient in writing, and he wrote manuscripts for the hospital's broadcasting room. One of them, "Commemorating August 1st, Recalling My Childhood," which was as long as three thousand words, was rated as an excellent manuscript. During the same period, he also learned to perform Shandong Allegro. He accompanied the hospital's amateur performance team to railway factories and military cultural schools to perform.

    In October 1954, because Li Qingshan repeatedly requested to be discharged from the hospital to work, the hospital introduced him to the Home for Disabled Revolutionary Soldiers. However, the Home for Disabled Revolutionary Soldiers did not agree to Li Qingshan working. Li Qingshan then suggested: before officially working, he could be a teacher of Shandong Allegro. The hospital agreed and introduced Li Qingshan to the County Cultural Center. He taught there for more than twenty days, teaching more than thirty apprentices. From then on, his confidence in working became stronger, so he requested to work in a factory, and even personally approached the County Chief. The County Chief encouraged him, saying, "You are a good son of the Party, we will definitely find a job for you." But after many days, the organization still did not assign him a job. Later, he understood that the factory cadres were needed to fill every position, and a blind person could only fill half a position, and it would be difficult to have more expenses; moreover, disabled people also needed someone to take care of them, and people were unwilling to take on this trouble. Therefore, he made a guarantee to the leadership: first, he did not want a salary and would first experiment for five months; second, he did not want the government to assign a caregiver, he would find a relative to lead the way; third, he would definitely learn to do the work, and if he didn't learn, he would never return to the Home for Disabled Revolutionary Soldiers. The County Party Committee Organization Department finally assigned Li Qingshan to the chemical factory to be the Party Branch Secretary.

    On the day Li Qingshan took office, the workers came to welcome him, but when they saw that he was blind, they were all disappointed. Some people said, "We waited and waited, and we got a blind branch secretary." People were very indifferent to him and did not issue him a staff card. His brother, Li Tieshan, who was the chairman of the trade union in this factory, also advised him to return to the Home for Disabled Revolutionary Soldiers. Li Qingshan said, "If I don't work, the state will still take care of me, but I don't want to live like that." He asked to have his sister-in-law lead the way for him, and his brother agreed.

    At the beginning of his work, Li Qingshan was unwilling to cause trouble to others in life. He first trained himself to eat without being fed by others, and learned to wash his face and brush his teeth by himself. He also learned to walk to various workshops without being led. He made friends in every workshop. After work every day, workers would come to him to report situations and work. Every day he would leave work one or two hours later than others. In the evenings and on Sundays, he would visit workers' homes to understand their difficulties and what opinions they had of the leadership. If he could solve them, he would solve them; if he couldn't solve them, he would suggest that the organization solve them.

    Li Qingshan also frequently gave political lessons to workers and party members. Every time he gave a lesson, he would prepare for more than ten days in advance: first, his brother would read the text to him, and he would combine the content of the text with the workers' ideological situation to form a lecture outline, ask his brother to write it down for him, and then he would memorize it firmly. In order to develop the Party and investigate the materials of party member development candidates, he had gone to Shenyang, Changtu, Shuangmiaozi and other places. His sister-in-law would buy the train tickets for him, and then hand him over to the train conductor to take care of him; after arriving at his destination, he would call the department he wanted to go to to have someone pick him up.

    In a period in 1955, the recovery rate of bright oil in the factory did not meet the requirements. The recovery rate stipulated by the higher authorities was 96%, but due to insufficient research on technology, it could only reach 93.93%. Li Qingshan discovered that one worker reached 94.04%, so he mobilized the masses to study the worker's experience. He and the factory director went deep into the workshop and convened seminars. Soon, the recovery rate of bright oil was overfulfilled, reaching 96.7%.

    Li Qingshan strictly adhered to the production and management policies stipulated by the Party and corrected the capitalist views of some people in the factory. This year, due to the development of agricultural producer cooperatives, the higher authorities stipulated that local industries should be oriented towards the countryside. However, some leading cadres in the factory wanted to produce products with high value and high profits, emphasizing that there were technical difficulties, and discarded the plan to produce new varieties. Under Li Qingshan's insistence, the factory hired technicians to produce noodles, black soap, and granular fertilizer for the countryside.

    So far, Li Qingshan has been working in the chemical factory for two years. His "experiment" has qualified him. The workers trust him, believing that although he cannot see, he is wholeheartedly serving the masses. He leads theoretical study in the factory and has twice been selected as a model student; he also concurrently serves as the principal of the Tieling County Local Workers' Joint School, and often goes out to give reports and lectures. The organization is also very satisfied with him, believing that he resolutely implements the Party's policies and guarantees the completion of production tasks.

    Li Qingshan himself is also very happy. He believes that since he left the army after being seriously injured, he still lives like a true revolutionary fighter.

    一个双目失明的残废军人当了工厂的党支部书记
    新华社记者　周长宗
    在全国烈属、军属、残废军人、复员军人社会主义建设积极分子大会上，记者访问了辽宁省残废军人代表李青山。他是一个双目失明、失去左手、聋了一只耳朵的特等残废军人，现在担任着辽宁省铁岭县地方国营化工厂中共党支部书记的职务。
    1953年冬天，李青山在朝鲜西海岸负了重伤，那时他二十二岁，是中国人民志愿军的一个排长。在昏迷状态中他被送到后方医院，当他苏醒过来、明白了自己失去了一对眼睛和一只左手的时候，认为一切都完了，他十分痛苦，曾起过自杀的念头。医院的党支部书记对他说：“我也是个残废人，咱们是一样的。摆在我们面前只有一条正确的道路，这就是保尔·柯察金和吴运铎走的路。”护士和医院的人，有空就读“钢铁是怎样炼成的？”和“把一切献给党”两本书给他听。两三个月的时间过去了，李青山想到，党把自己这样一个拾煤核的孩子培养成一个军官，可不容易，他应当继续为党工作。他还想到，自己小时候读过三年书，参加革命军队后，文化水平提高到了高小程度，只要努力，自己也可以成为保尔·柯察金和吴运铎那样有用的人。从此，他练习起写字来，每天沿着硬壳纸做的横格子练习。几个月后，字写得熟练了，他为医院的广播室写稿，其中一篇“纪念八一，回忆我的少年时期”，长达三千字，被评为优秀稿件。在同一时期，他还学会了说山东快书，随着医院的业余演出队到铁路工厂和部队文化学校去演唱。
    1954年10月间，由于李青山一再要求出院工作，医院把他介绍到荣军教养院。但是，荣军教养院并不同意李青山工作。李青山便提出：在正式工作之前，可以让他当山东快书的教员。院方同意了，把李青山介绍到县文化馆。他在那里上了二十多天课，教出了三十多个徒弟。从此，他工作的信心更强了，便要求到工厂去工作，还亲自去找过县长。县长鼓励他说：“你是党的好儿子，我们一定设法给你找工作。”但是过了许多日子，组织上仍然没有分配他工作。后来他明白了，工厂的干部一个要顶一个用，瞎子只能顶半个人，多一份开支就不好办；况且，残废人还得有人照顾，人家不愿找这份麻烦。于是，他向领导上提出保证：第一、他不要薪金，先试验五个月；第二、不要公家派护理员，自己找个亲属领路；第三、一定学会做工作，学不会就永远也不回教养院来。县委组织部最后终于把李青山分配到化工厂来当党支部书记。
    李青山到职的那一天，工人都来欢迎他，但是一见是个瞎子，都很扫兴。有人说：“千盼万盼，盼了个瞎支书来”。人们对他很冷淡，也没发工作人员证给他。他哥哥李铁山在这个厂里当工会主席，也劝他回教养院。李青山说：“我不工作，国家也养我的老，可是我不愿意那样活着。”他要求让他嫂子给他领路，他哥哥答应了。
    一开始工作，李青山不愿在生活上给别人添麻烦，他先锻炼自己吃饭，不让别人喂，又学会了自己洗脸、刷牙，还学会了不用人领着走路，自己到各个车间去。他在每个车间都交了朋友，每到下班以后，工人找他反映情况、汇报工作。每天他总比别人晚下班一两个小时。晚上和星期天，他到工人家里去访问，了解他们有什么困难，对领导上有什么意见。他能够解决的，由他来解决；他不能解决的，便建议组织上解决。
    李青山还经常给工人和党员上政治课。他每讲一次课，事先要准备十多天：先由他哥哥将课文读给他听，他将课文内容和工人的思想情况结合起来构成讲授提纲，请他哥哥代写下来，他再把它牢牢记住。为了发展党、调查党员发展对象的材料，他曾经到沈阳、昌图、双庙子等地方去，由他嫂嫂给买上车票，然后把他交给火车上的列车员照顾；到达目的地后，再打电话请所要去的部门来人领他。
    1955年一个时期中，厂内的亮油回收率达不到要求，上级规定的回收率是96％，可是由于钻研技术不够，只能达到93.93％。李青山发现一个工人达到94.04％，于是他发动群众，研究这个工人的经验，他和厂长分头深入车间，召集座谈会。不久，亮油回收率超额完成，达到了96.7％。
    李青山严格坚持了党规定的生产和经营方针，纠正了厂内某些人的资本主义观点。今年，由于农业生产合作化的开展，上级规定：地方工业要面向农村。但是厂里某些领导干部，都要生产价值大、油水多的产品，强调技术上有困难，把生产新品种的计划丢在一边。在李青山的坚持下，厂里聘请了技术员，为农村生产面碱、黑肥皂和颗粒肥料。
    到现在为止，李青山在化工厂已经工作了两年。他“试验”够格了，工人都信任他，认为他虽然眼睛看不着，却一心一意为群众办事。他领导厂内的理论学习，两次被评选为学习模范；他还兼任铁岭县地方职工联校的校长，经常出去作报告和上课。组织上对他也非常满意，认为他坚决执行了党的政策，保证了生产任务的完成。
    李青山自己也非常快活，他认为自己从负重伤离开部队以后，活得仍然像一个真正的革命战士。
