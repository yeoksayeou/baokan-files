Xinhua News Agency, November 8th. Xinhua News Agency reporter Li Feng reported: More than 600 above-quota factory and mine projects are under construction across the country, with approximately 40 to be completed or put into production in the fourth quarter.

According to the National Bureau of Statistics, the basic construction investment plans and construction tasks to be completed in the fourth quarter of this year account for more than 40% of the total for the year; the workload of basic construction in the fourth quarter of this year exceeds the same period last year by 57%.

Relevant parties told reporters that rationally arranging plans and ensuring project quality are extremely important issues in completing the arduous and intensive construction tasks of the fourth quarter.

Relevant parties pointed out that all departments and regions should continue to rationally arrange basic construction plans based on the material supply situation in this quarter and the possible difficulties in investment and material supply next year. This approach can prevent some units from creating a situation of “spreading too thin” or “getting ahead of themselves” in order to complete this year's plan, or to get the state to allocate more funds and building materials to the unit next year, without considering the possibility of investment and material supply next year, trying to start more projects and rush construction. This kind of "initiative" that does not consider the objective conditions of national construction and the overall national plan will lead to many projects next year failing to achieve their goals, being forced to stop construction, and causing waste. Rationally adjusting plans can also prevent some units from using a lot of money on secondary projects this year in order to complete the plan, or thinking that the state's investment in secondary projects next year can be greatly reduced. At the same time, all departments and regions should strictly control the investment amount within the indicators issued by the State Council to prevent breaking through the entire national basic construction investment plan for this year, which would bring difficulties to the national financial plan.

According to a reporter from the State Construction Commission, due to a lack of building materials and other reasons, it may be difficult for nearly 100 above-quota projects in 18 central ministries to complete their plans this year. Based on this situation, the ministries have successively preliminarily rearranged their plans, concentrating materials and construction forces on urgent or important projects that can be put into production this year or next. For example, the First Ministry of Machine Building appropriately postponed the construction of some projects of the First Tractor Factory, and reduced some individual projects that were originally planned to start this year, thereby ensuring projects such as heavy machinery manufacturing plants that are more urgently needed and important for China's industrialization. However, some cadres in some units have developed some negative emotions when they see the shortage of building materials and the consequences of an overambitious construction plan. They have not yet taken the initiative to adjust their plans. It should be seen that rationally adjusting plans now is not only for better completing the plan for the fourth quarter of this year, but also related to the major construction plan for next year.

Relevant parties believe that attention should also be paid to changing the current unbalanced construction situation of various departments when adjusting plans. By the third quarter, the Ministry of Health had only completed 27.3% of its construction plan for this year; the departments of culture and education, and political and legal affairs also did not complete well. The basic construction of these departments has been like this for several years, so that some hospital plans have been built for two or three years, but are still plans. If this continues, it will disconnect China's cultural, educational, and health undertakings from the development of the national economy. These departments are "unarmed" and have no construction strength, so construction departments should appropriately take into account the difficulties of these departments when arranging plans.

The plans that have been adjusted must be worked hard to complete by all departments. In the fourth quarter, many new projects will be put into production. After these projects are put into production, they can produce 510,000 tons of steel, 410,000 tons of iron, more than 100,000 kilowatts of electricity, more than 3 million tons of coal, more than 400,000 tons of cement, and more than 100,000 tons of oil for the country every year. Therefore, ensuring the completion of these projects is of great significance to increasing China's economic strength and improving the construction situation next year. Relevant parties believe that it is necessary to point this out at present. According to statistics from the National Bureau of Statistics, of the 72 projects that the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry and the Ministry of Electric Power Industry planned to be completed in the third quarter, only 34 were actually completed. This situation also exists in other ministries and provinces and cities. Therefore, by the end of September this year, the fixed assets increased due to investment nationwide had only completed 33.7% of the annual plan, which was even worse than the completion situation in the previous two years. This requires relevant departments to strive to change this situation in the fourth quarter.

Relevant parties pointed out that special attention should be paid to ensuring project quality in the fourth quarter. From January to September this year, many projects had poor quality. Now a large number of projects are about to enter winter construction. In the past, this cold season had the most quality accidents. Therefore, all construction units should take various effective measures to ensure project quality.

Originally, in the early days of China's construction, the quality of some important projects had been well received due to everyone's hard work. However, since this year, many civil construction projects in various places have shown poor quality phenomena such as uneven floors, uneven paint, leaky doors and windows, poor sound insulation, peeling walls, and leaking ceilings. The quality of some industrial buildings this year is excellent, but due to insufficient attention to the quality of waterproof and backfill engineering, serious phenomena such as basement water leakage, roof asphalt sliding, and foundation settlement have occurred. For example, some major projects in Anshan and Luoyang, and the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant project in Changchun, have relatively serious non-compliance with quality standards, which has caused great waste. Currently, the State Construction Commission is inspecting the quality of some projects.

Relevant parties believe that the reasons why the quality of many projects is not good now that workers' skills have improved, construction machinery has increased, and cadres have construction management experience, in addition to the poor quality of building materials and the reduction of project costs, is mainly because some people have ignored the "good" aspect of the construction principle of "more, faster, better, and more economical," and have been diluted by that kind of complacency or indifference. Therefore, to ensure the quality of projects constructed this winter, we must overcome and prevent complacency, check the specific reasons for poor quality, and take corresponding measures.

### 争取完成第四季度基本建设的繁重任务  必须合理安排计划保证工程质量

    争取完成第四季度基本建设的繁重任务
    必须合理安排计划保证工程质量
    新华社8日讯　新华社记者李峰报道：全国有六百多个限额以上的工厂和矿山工程正在施工，大约有四十多项应在第四季度完工或投入生产。
    据国家统计局的统计，今年第四季应完成的基本建设投资计划和施工任务，占全年的40％以上；今年第四季的基本建设工作量，超过去年同期57％。
    有关方面向记者表示，合理地安排计划和保证工程质量，是完成第四季艰巨而紧张的建设任务中十分重要的问题。
    有关方面指出，各部门和各地区应根据本季度的材料供应情况，以及明年投资和材料供应可能出现的困难情况，继续合理地安排基本建设计划。这样做是能够防止有些单位为了完成今年计划，或者为了使国家明年多拨给本单位的资金和建筑材料，先造成“铺大摊子”或
  “跨上马”的事实，而不考虑明年投资和材料供应的可能性，尽量多开工，多赶工突击。这种不考虑国家建设的客观条件和国家整个计划的“积极性”，将会招致明年许多工程，欲速不达，被迫停工，造成浪费。合理地调整计划，还可以防止有些单位为了完成计划，或者认为国家明年对次要工程的投资可以大大削减，因而今年把许多钱用于次要的工程上。同时，各部门和各地区，还应该把投资额严格地控制在国务院下达的指标上，防止突破整个国家今年基本建设的投资计划，为国家财政计划带来困难。
    据记者从国家建设委员会获悉，由于缺乏建筑材料及其它原因，今年中央十八个部有近百个限额以上的工程，完成计划可能比较困难。根据这种情况，各部曾先后初步重新安排了计划，把材料和施工力量，集中用到需要急迫或今明年能投入生产的重要工程。例如第一机械工业部，适当地推迟了第一拖拉机厂的某些工程的建设，削减了原来计划今年动工的个别工程，从而保证了对我国工业化更急需而重要的重型机械制造厂等工程。但是也有些单位的干部，看到建筑材料不足和建设计划冒进的后果时，产生了一些消极情绪。至今还没有主动调整计划。应该看到，现在合理地调整计划，不仅为了更好的完成今年第四季度计划，而且有关明年建设大计。
    有关方面认为，在调整计划时还要注意改变目前各部门的建设不平衡的状况。到第三季度止，卫生部今年的建设计划才完成了27.3％；文教、政法等部门也完成得不好。这些部门的基本建设，几年来一直如此，以致有的医院计划建了两三年，仍然还是计划。这样下去，就会使我国的文教卫生等事业，和国民经济的发展脱节。这些部门“手无寸铁”，又没有施工力量，因此，施工部门安排计划时，应该适当照顾到这些部门的困难。
    已经调整了的计划，各部门必须努力完成。第四季度将有很多新的工程投入生产，这些工程投入生产以后，每年可以为国家生产五十一万吨钢，四十一万吨铁，十几万瓩电，三百多万吨煤，四十多万吨水泥，十多万吨石油。因此，保证完成这些工程，对增长我国的经济实力和改善明年的建设情况，都有重大的作用。有关方面认为，目前指出这一点是必要的，据国家统计局的统计，冶金和电力工业部，第三季度计划交工的七十二项工程，实际交工的只有三十四项。这种情况在其它部和省市也同样存在着。因此到今年9月底，全国因投资而增加的固定资产，才完成了全年计划的33.7％，比前两年完成的情况还不好。这就需要有关部门，力求在第四季度改变这一状况。
    有关方面指出，第四季度应特别注意保证工程质量。今年1至9月，有不少工程发生了质量不好的现象。现在大量的工程要进入冬季施工，历年来这个严寒的季节，质量事故最多，因此，各施工单位应该采取各种有效措施，保证工程质量。
    本来，我国刚开始建设的日子里，由于大家兢兢业业，有些重要工程的质量，曾获得了好评。但是，今年以来，各地有不少民用建筑工程，出现了地板不平、油漆不匀、门窗不严、隔音不好、墙灰脱落和天棚漏水等质量低劣的现象。今年有些工业建筑的质量是优良的，但是，由于对防水和回填土工程的质量注意不够，以致发生地下室漏水、屋面沥青滑动、基础下沉等严重现象。如鞍山和洛阳的某些重大工程，长春第一汽车制造厂工程，都有比较严重的不合质量标准的情况，并因此造成了很大浪费。目前，国家建设委员会正在对某些工程的质量进行检查。
    有关方面认为，现在工人的技术提高了，施工机械增加了，干部也有了施工管理经验，许多工程的质量反而不好的原因，除去和建筑材料质量不好，降低了工程造价等原因以外，最主要的是有些人把“又多、又快、又好、又省”的建设原则中的“又好”这一条忽视了，被那种不是沾沾自喜也是满不在乎的情绪冲淡了。因此，要保证今年冬季施工的工程质量，必须克服和防止自满情绪，检查质量坏的具体原因，采取相应的措施。
