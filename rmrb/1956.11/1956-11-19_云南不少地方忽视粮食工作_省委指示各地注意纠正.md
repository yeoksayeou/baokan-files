　　This newspaper reports that many areas of Yunnan Province have been laissez-faire about the distribution and purchase of grain. In Panzhihua Township, Wenshan County, the Grain problem was simply handled by the commune's management committee announcing the amount of grain retained and the amount of grain sold to the members. In many places in Simao, Dali, and Chuxiong counties, farmers complained that "the amount of food grain retained is too small" even though they received more grain this year. Some local cadres re-stipulated food grain standards, reclassified surplus grain households and grain-deficient households, and re-stipulated unified purchase ratios in an attempt to reduce the state's purchase quota. Lijiang County's Leyuan Agricultural Cooperative stipulated that an average of 600 jin per person for the spring harvest was considered a surplus grain household. Although grain production increased by more than 50% this year, the total purchase quota for the cooperative was reduced by 45% compared to last year's "three fix" "purchase" quota. On the issue of agricultural tax collection, some places blindly expanded the scope of reductions and exemptions. Kaiyuan County reduced or exempted more than 40,000 jin last year, and this year they want to reduce or exempt 90,000 jin. Some cooperatives planned to use all the public grain that was reduced or exempted to cover the "five guarantee households" to show the "superiority" of the cooperative. Some cooperatives had completely distributed the grain to individuals, and in the end had to re-mobilize the members to take it out.

　　The above situation has attracted the attention of the Yunnan Provincial Party Committee. The Provincial Party Committee required agricultural cooperatives in various places to retain the public grain that should be handed over, the surplus grain that should be sold, and the cooperative's public grain, and then distribute food grain to each member household according to last year's "three fix" grain retention standards, and then distribute the surplus grain according to work days. Many places in Qujing, Zhaotong, Mengzi and other counties have done this, and the masses are very satisfied. The Yunnan Provincial Party Committee pointed out: Although grain production has increased this year, we must not think that everything is fine. We must strengthen the inspection and guidance of grass-roots work and be vigilant and overcome the tendency to relax political and ideological work in grain work.

    云南不少地方忽视粮食工作
    省委指示各地注意纠正
    本报讯　云南省不少地区对粮食的分配和征购工作放任自流。文山县攀枝花乡在处理粮食问题时只是简单地由社务管理委员会向社员宣布一下留粮数和卖粮数就算了事。思茅、大理、楚雄等县的不少地方的农民，虽然今年分的粮食多了，仍然叫喊“口粮留少了”。有些地方干部重新规定口粮标准，重新划余粮户和缺粮户，重新规定统购比例，企图减少国家的征购数量。丽江县的乐园农业社规定大春平均每人六百斤才是余粮户，虽然今年粮食增产50％以上，但全社定购数反较去年“三定”的“定购”数减少45％。在公粮征收问题上，有些地方盲目扩大减免面。开远县五个乡去年减免四万多斤，今年就想减免九万斤。有的社打算把“五保户”全部用减免的那部分公粮包下来，以显示合作社的“优越”。有的社已把粮食完全分给个人，最后不得不重新动员社员拿出来。
    上述情况已经引起云南省委的注意。省委要求各地农业社把应交的公粮和应卖的余粮以及社的公用粮留下后，再按去年“三定”的留粮标准分给每户社员口粮，然后再按劳动日分配余粮。曲靖、昭通、蒙自等县的许多地方这样做了，群众都很满意。云南省委指出：今年粮食虽然增产了，但决不能认为太平无事，必须加强检查和指导基层的工作，警惕和克服粮食工作中放松政治思想工作的倾向。
