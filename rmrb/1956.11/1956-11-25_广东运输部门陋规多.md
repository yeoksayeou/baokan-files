    Many Malpractices in Guangdong Transportation Department
    We are cadres of the Guangdong Provincial Department of Commerce and have many dealings with the transportation departments. From our daily contact, we deeply feel that some of the rules and regulations of the Guangdong transportation departments are detrimental to the promotion of material exchange. We would like to raise them in the newspaper and hope that the Guangdong transportation departments will consider improvements.

    Where Did a Ton-Heavy Water Buffalo Come From?
    First, the freight rates are unreasonable. The Guangzhou Maritime Bureau stipulates that the freight rate from Haikou, Hainan Island, to Guangzhou is calculated at one ton per water buffalo, 800 kilograms per yellow cattle, 200 kilograms per pig, and 100 kilograms per sheep. In fact, each water buffalo weighs only 200 to 300 kilograms, yellow cattle only 150 to 200 kilograms, pigs only 60 to 80 kilograms, and sheep only 18 to 25 kilograms. This means that the freight for one head of livestock is equivalent to three or four heads. According to this pricing method, the freight for one water buffalo is 14.5 yuan. The shipping bureau's charging standard is even higher, charging 19.58 yuan per water buffalo. In addition, there are Haikou warehouse departure fees, barge fees, unloading barge to large ship fees, on-board racking fees, insurance fees, and port fees, totaling about 40% of the price of the cattle. Such high freight rates seriously affect the export of vegetable cattle and live pigs from Hainan Island. Hainan Island exports about 20,000 to 30,000 vegetable cattle every year. Due to the high freight rates, about 30% to 40% of the vegetable cattle cannot be shipped out each year, resulting in this situation: on the one hand, Guangzhou lacks meat, and on the other hand, Hainan Island has cattle but cannot sell them.

    Punishing Others but Not Oneself
    Second, some fines are unfair. It is said that fines are to urge both parties to better implement the contract, but the Guangzhou transportation department's fine system only penalizes the consigning units. For example, on the morning of May 12 this year, the Guangdong Department Store, according to the transportation plan agreed upon in advance by both parties, requested 14 trucks from the Guangzhou Transportation Company to transport 40 tons of goods to the Nan'an warehouse for loading onto ships. However, the transportation company only sent seven trucks in the morning, and only added seven more trucks after 4:00 pm. Because the trucks arrived too late, when the ship sailed, there were still 12 tons of goods that could not be loaded. As a result, the department store's goods not only failed to be shipped according to plan, but were fined 194 yuan for empty cabin fees for "failing to load goods on time." In July this year, the Yangjiang County Food Company requested the Yangjiang Transportation Station, under the Guangdong Transportation Bureau, to send seven trucks according to plan to load pigs to Sanpu Town, Kaiping, and then transfer them by ship to Guangzhou. However, the Yangjiang Transportation Station only sent three trucks at the time, and one of them broke down halfway. When the two trucks arrived at Sanpu Town, the ship had already sailed. As a result, the Yangjiang County Food Company not only failed to ship the goods on time, but was also fined more than 120 yuan by the shipping company. These two fines were both due to "the consigning unit failing to load goods on time," and therefore were fined. However, the consigning unit's failure to load goods on time was affected by the Guangzhou Transportation Company and Yangjiang Transportation Station and other transportation departments failing to dispatch vehicles according to plan, and these transportation departments were not fined a penny. What is even more infuriating is that in January this year, the Yingde Shipping Station, fearing that the transportation plan would not be completed, requested state-owned commercial departments to bring forward the allocation of materials for February. The commercial departments prepaid a portion of the goods according to their requirements. Afterwards, the shipping station demanded fines from the commercial departments for violating transportation regulations by allocating goods beyond the plan. These unreasonable fines cause great losses to the commercial departments every year.

    Fragmented Consignment is Difficult
    Third, there is no unified combined transportation among the Guangzhou railway, shipping, maritime, and automobile transportation departments. In addition, the loading and unloading units of the Guangzhou Transportation Company and the intra-city automobile transportation are not connected, forming a fragmented phenomenon in transportation. Consigning units must run through all transportation departments such as railway, shipping, maritime, and automobile transportation to ship goods; otherwise, it is difficult to ship things out. For example, to transport Guangzhou industrial products to the Leizhou Peninsula, you must first apply to the Guangzhou Transportation Company and the handling station to dispatch trucks and workers to the warehouse to pick up the goods and transport them to the dock, and then run to the Maritime Bureau to apply for a ship to load the goods and ship them to Zhanjiang. After arriving in Zhanjiang, you must run to the Transportation Bureau to apply for a car to transport it to the county. If you don't run to one place, the goods cannot be transported to their destination.
    All transportation departments require the transportation plan of the consigning unit to be 100% accurate. Without a plan, no one will accept it, but after the consigning unit's plan is sent to the railway, waterway, and highway transportation departments, the approved plans are not connected, and the trains, ships, and automobiles all have their own requirements, so there are often cases of having a car but no ship, or having a ship but no car, and having goods but not being able to ship them out. For example, in July this year, the Shantou Textile Company's Huiyang Allocation Group compiled a transportation plan for 335 tons of cotton cloth. The Guangdong Transportation Bureau did not allocate vehicles according to the plan, and more than 130 tons of it failed to be transported to the required areas according to the plan, which once made the supply of cotton cloth in the market tense.

    Segmented Transportation is Troublesome
    Fourth, the Pearl River shipping system has a division of labor that the mainstream and tributaries do not infringe upon each other. The Dongjiang waterway from Guangzhou to Laolong, which is more than 430 miles, was originally a direct waterway, which has always been relatively convenient, but it is divided into two sections, Guangzhou to Huizhou, and Huizhou to Laolong, by unreasonable transportation regulations, and it is not allowed to cross the border. This not only prolongs the transportation time, but also increases the freight rate of each ton of general merchandise by two to three yuan. To transport live pigs and poultry from Luoding, Xinyi and other counties to Guangzhou, it is stipulated that the tributary transportation range can only reach Nanjiangkou. Therefore, after the ship arrives at Nanjiangkou, the goods must be unloaded into the warehouse. After the ship within the mainstream transportation range arrives, it must be taken out of the warehouse and transferred to the mainstream ship for transportation to Guangzhou; otherwise, it is a violation of the regulations. This not only increases transportation costs, but also increases the transportation time by two days. In addition to increasing the trouble of transportation work and blocking the normal circulation of commodities, it is really impossible to find any "superiority" in these regulations. If these problems are not resolved as soon as possible, the impact on transportation work will be disastrous.

### 广东运输部门陋规多

    广东运输部门陋规多
    我们是广东省商业厅的干部，同交通运输部门打交道的时候很多。从日常接触中，深深感到广东省交通运输部门的有些规章制度，对于促进物资交流是不利的，借报纸一角提出来，希望广东省交通运输部门考虑改进。
    何来一吨重的水牛
    首先是运费不合理。广州海运局规定，从海南岛的海口运到广州，每头水牛按一吨重计算运价，每头黄牛按八百公斤计算运价，每头猪按二百公斤计算运价，每头羊按一百公斤计算运价。实际上每头水牛只有二百至三百公斤，黄牛只有一百五十至二百公斤，猪只有六十至八十公斤，羊只有十八至二十五公斤。这就是说，运一头牲畜需要交三、四头的运费。按照这个计价办法，运一头水牛就要收运费十四元五角。航运局的收费标准还要高，每头水牛他们要收十九元五角八分。此外还要缴纳海口出仓费、驳船费、卸驳上大船费、船上搭架费、保险费以及港务费等等，总计大约要占牛价的40％以上。这样高的运费严重影响了海南岛菜牛和生猪的外运。海南岛每年外运的菜牛约两万到三万头，因为运费过高，每年约有30％—40％的菜牛运不出来。以致造成这样的局面：一方面广州市肉食不够，一方面海南岛有牛又卖不出去。
    罚别人不罚自己
    第二是有些罚款不公平。按说罚款是为了督促双方更好地执行合约，可是广州市交通运输部门的罚款制度却只罚托运单位。例如今年5月12日上午，广东省百货公司按事前双方已订好的运输计划，向广州市运输公司要十四辆汽车到南岸仓库运四十吨货装船。但运输公司上午只派去七辆汽车，直到下午四点钟以后，才又加派七辆汽车，由于车子到的时间太晚，开船的时候，仍有十二吨货物没有能装船，结果百货公司的货物不仅没有能按计划运走，反被以“不按时装货”罚了一百九十四元的空舱费；今年7月间，阳江县食品公司，请广东省运输局所属阳江运输站按计划派七辆汽车装猪到开平三铺镇，再转船运往广州，但阳江运输站到时只派去三辆汽车，其中有一辆行驶到半途又抛了锚，当两辆汽车赶到三铺镇的时候，船已经开了，结果阳江县食品公司不但没有能把货物按时运走，还被船方罚款一百二十多元。这两次罚款事件都是“托运单位不按时装货”，因而被罚了款。可是托运单位不按时装货，是受了广州市运输公司和阳江运输站等运输部门不按计划派车的影响，而这些运输部门是一文也罚不到的。更气人的是今年1月份英德航运站怕运输计划完不成，要求国营商业部门把2月份的物资提前下调，商业部门根据他们的要求提前托运了一部分货物，事后这个航运站却又以商业部门超计划调货违犯运输规章向商业部门要求罚款。这种种不合理的罚款，每年都使商业部门遭受到很大损失。
    四分五裂托运难
    第三，广州市铁路、航运、海运、汽车等交通运输部门没有统一的联合运输，加上广州市运输公司的装卸单位和市内汽车运输互不衔接，形成运输中的四分五裂现象。托运单位发货起运必须跑遍铁路、航运、海运、汽车等所有运输部门，否则东西就很难运出。例如把广州市的工业品运到雷州半岛去，先要向广州市运输公司和搬运站申请派汽车和工人到仓口出货运到码头，再跑到海运局申请派船装货起运到湛江，到湛江后还要跑到运输局申请汽车运到县里去。缺一个地方不跑到，货物就不能运到目的地。
    各运输部门都要求托运单位的运输计划做到百分之百的准确。没有计划就没有人受理，但托运单位的计划送到铁路、水路、公路等运输部门后，批出来的却互不衔接，火车、轮船、汽车又各有各的要求，因而经常发生有车无船、或有船无车、有货运不出去的事情。例如今年7月份汕头纺织公司惠阳调拨组，编造了三百三十五吨棉布运输计划，广东省运输局不按计划调配车辆，其中有一百三十多吨就没能按计划运到各需要地区，曾使市场上棉布供应一度紧张。
    分段运输麻烦多
    第四、珠江航运水系有主流和支流互不侵犯的分工规定。从广州到老隆四百三十多里的东江水道，本来是直达航道，一向比较方便，但被不合理的运输规定分成广州到惠州，惠州到老隆两段运输，不得越境，这样不仅拖长了运输时间，并且使每吨百货增加了二——三元的运价；从罗定、信宜等县运生猪、家禽到广州，因为规定支流运输范围只能到南江口。因此船到南江口以后，货物就得上岸入仓，等主流运输范围的船来了以后，再出仓转到主流船上运往广州，否则就是违犯规定。这样不但增加了运输费用，并且增加了两天的运输时间。这些规定除了增加运输工作的麻烦，堵塞商品正常流转以外，实在找不出它有什么“优越性”。这些问题，如不及早解决，对运输工作的影响是不堪设想的。
