Title: The Harmful and Useless “On-Time Arrival”

    The Guangzhou Railway Bureau has recently been experiencing a strange phenomenon: trains carrying small, scattered goods have become "fast direct trains." Along the way, goods that should be loaded are not loaded, and goods that should be unloaded are not unloaded; sometimes goods are carried past their stations, and sometimes goods are unloaded before reaching their stations. Freight cars clearly marked for Guangzhou North Station and West Station arrive at those stations but don't stop to unload goods, instead speeding straight to Guangzhou South Station, where they stop for several hours before being pulled back. Sometimes, twenty or thirty trains a day make this inexplicable journey.

    What's going on? It turns out that some leaders and dispatchers at the bureau are afraid that unloading goods and then shunting the cars will cause delays, and delays will affect their "performance."

    Trains must run according to the scheduled time. If one train is delayed, it will affect other trains, disrupting the entire transportation plan and the work order of the stations, wasting locomotives and rolling stock, and affecting the completion of transportation tasks. The train staff will also be unable to rest on time. Therefore, the railway department requires trains to run on time. If a delay occurs for some special reason, the dispatcher is responsible for trying to make up time. A high on-time rate can lead to praise and rewards.

    However, making up time must never be done by wasting transportation resources. In order to make up time and pursue on-time performance, the Guangzhou Railway Bureau is resorting to unscrupulous means, hauling heavy and empty cars back and forth. In this way, although the train arrives at its destination on time, and they can receive praise and rewards, what good does this do for completing transportation tasks? Such "on-time arrival" is even more wasteful of transportation resources and delays the normal exchange of industrial and agricultural products even more than delays would. We don't need this kind of on-time arrival.

    The state has stipulated various technical and economic indicators for various economic departments. To achieve these indicators, we can and should look for all kinds of methods. However, there is one principle: the methods used must not violate the purpose for which these indicators were formulated. Units and individuals that achieve the indicators should be praised and rewarded. However, there is also a principle that those who substantially undermine these indicators should never be rewarded.

    有害无益的“正点到达”
    廖玉龙
    广州铁路分局最近时常出现这样的怪事：沿途运送零星货物的列车变成了“快速直达列车”。一路上，应该装的货物不装，应该卸的货物不卸；有时候把货物带过了站，有时候没到站就把货物卸了下来。明明挂着广州北站、西站的货车，到了广州北站和西站却不停下来卸东西，反而呼呼地一直开到广州南站，在南站停了几个小时，才又往回拉。有时候，几天之中，要有二、三十辆车在作这种莫名其妙的旅行。
    这是怎么回事呢？原来是这个分局的一些领导人员和调度人员，怕列车卸下东西再甩车，会晚点；而晚点就会影响他们的“成绩”。
    列车必须按照规定的时间运行。如果某一列车晚点了，就要影响别的列车也晚点，这样就要打乱整个运输计划和车站的工作秩序，浪费机车车辆，影响运输任务的完成。列车上的工作人员也将连带着不能按时休息。所以，铁路部门要求列车必须正点运行。如果因为某种特殊的原因晚点了，调度员有责任设法抢正点。正点率高，就可以得到表扬和奖励。
    但是，抢正点绝不能用浪费运输力量的方法。为了抢正点，追求正点率，广州铁路分局竟不择手段地拖着重车、空车来回跑。这样，虽然列车是正点到达目的站了，自己也因而可以得到表扬和奖励。但是，这对完成运输任务有什么好处呢？这样的“正点”，比误点还要更加浪费运输力量，更加耽误工农业产品的正常交流。我们不需要这样的正点。
    国家给各个经济部门规定了各种技术经济指标，为了达到这些指标，可以而且应该寻找各种各样的方法。但是，这里有一个原则：所使用的方法决不能违反制定这些指标的目的。对达到指标的单位和个人，应该给以表扬和奖励。但是，也有一个原则，绝不能奖励那些在实质上损害这些指标的人。
