	The Victory Struggle in Sunagawa Town
	Lan Hai
	On the night of October 14th, the town of Sunagawa resounded with cheers of "Long live victory!" The Japanese people jubilantly celebrated the victory in the struggle against the American military base in Sunagawa Town.

	On this day, the Japanese government authorities were forced to decide to halt the surveying work on the land in Sunagawa Town. When the news of the victory arrived, all the farmers in the town and the workers and students of the "support team" stationed there cheered and jumped for joy. They raised the banners of the labor unions and student federations, as well as the straw mat flags symbolizing the farmers' struggle, forming countless teams, shoulder to shoulder, shouting long live, embracing each other, and demonstrating and marching on the land they had defended with their blood. The housewives of Sunagawa Town tightly grasped the hands of the workers and students, saying with tears in their eyes: "This is your strength, thank you! Thank you!"

	The marching crowd unanimously surged towards the struggle headquarters set up in the grounds of the Azusawa-Aji Tenjin Shrine. More than three thousand people packed the temple grounds. In the crowd, one could also see some people with bandages on their heads, sitting in freight handcarts, pushed by the children of Sunagawa Town, who had been injured in the struggle. Around the roaring bonfire, more than three thousand people began to sing "The Song of the National Independence Action Team." The singing shook the US Far East Air Force Headquarters, separated only by a wire fence, sending shivers down the spines of the Americans.

	At 9:20 PM, the victory celebration officially began. Representatives of the local residents, such as Sunagawa Town Mayor Miyazaki and Action Team Captain Aoki, representatives of the workers and students of the "support team," and representatives of the Socialist Party, Communist Party, and Labor-Farmer Party, led by Socialist Party Secretary-General Asanuma, all spoke. They unanimously declared the common will of the Japanese people: "We will unite and fight until the US-Japan Security Treaty is abolished, until the last US military base is eliminated from Japanese territory, and until final victory is achieved."

	What exactly is the significance of the Sunagawa Town struggle?

	The American plan to expand Tachikawa base is part of the American strategic deployment in the Far East. The US Air Force, in order to prepare for atomic warfare in the Far East, has decided to begin this year in November to replace the F86D Sabre jet fighters originally deployed at various air bases in Japan with the latest American supersonic aircraft capable of carrying small atomic bombs – the North American F100 Sabre. This type of aircraft has already been transported to the US military base in Itazuke, Fukuoka, Japan, and is ready to be distributed to major air bases. This blatantly demonstrates the American policy of wanting to use Japan as an atomic war base.

	However, the aforementioned F100 Sabre aircraft requires a runway of 9,000 feet to take off and land freely, while the runways at the major US air bases in Japan are currently only 5,000 to 6,000 feet long. Therefore, the United States is eager to expand the bases to extend the runways.

	In April of last year, the US government, taking advantage of the Japanese government's financial difficulties, forced Japan to agree to expand the five largest US air bases in Tachikawa (Sunagawa), Komaki, Kisarazu, Niigata, and Yokota, in exchange for reducing Japan's "defense burden sharing fee" for the 1955 fiscal year by 17.8 billion yen. The total area of its expansion amounts to 700,000 tsubo. The Japanese government agreed to this request. The US Department of Defense has included the costs required to expand these five major air bases in Japan in the 1956 fiscal year budget and has received approval from the US Congress. This fiscal year's budget is due to end on June 30, 1956, so the US Far East Command wants to take over the land and pave the runways before June 30, in order to transport the atomic warplanes according to the planned schedule.

	In 1955, the Japanese government mobilized a police force of 5,000 men, repeatedly engaging in fierce clashes with the farmers and workers who were defending the land of Sunagawa, causing 214 Japanese people to shed blood. However, after expending such great effort, the Japanese authorities only managed to drive thirty stakes into the land of Sunagawa, and the land surveyed was less than one-third of the area planned for expansion (the authorities called this land the first designated expropriation area). The farmers of Sunagawa, facing violence, cried out: "Although the stakes can be driven into the soil, they cannot penetrate our hearts." In an instant, this sentence became a slogan for the people of Japan. Under these circumstances, the Japanese government's attempt to use money to appease and buy off the people also failed. In April of this year, the farmers of Sunagawa took the "agreement notices" sent by the Japanese government's Procurement Agency to seventeen farmers (landowners), including Aoki Ichigoro, the action team leader of the anti-base expansion struggle in Sunagawa, burned them on the land planned for expansion in front of the Tachikawa Airport runway, and held an anti-base struggle bonfire rally on the spot.

	The Japanese authorities, who were in a state of utter frustration, decided to forcibly seize the farmers' land in accordance with the US-Japan Administrative Agreement, using the Land Expropriation Law, and ordered Tokyo Governor Yasui to issue directives, attempting to force Sunagawa Town Mayor Miyazaki to issue an announcement to the farmers. However, Mayor Miyazaki declared: "Even if I am nailed to the cross, I will not issue the announcement." Because there was no announcement from the head of the local autonomous body, the government's Procurement Agency could not expropriate the farmers' land, and the Tokyo Governor filed a lawsuit against Mayor Miyazaki in court on the grounds of "resisting the order to issue the announcement." At the same time, the farmers of Sunagawa filed a lawsuit against Prime Minister Hatoyama on the grounds that "the seizure of land violates the constitution." In order to protect the rights of the farmers of Sunagawa Town, a huge defense team, headed by Haiuno Fukichi, the president of the Japan Lawyers Association, and composed of over one hundred prominent Japanese lawyers, was organized to defend the farmers of Sunagawa. In this way, the Japanese people launched a legal battle against the government authorities.

	The farmers of Sunagawa and the people who supported them were determined to carry out this struggle.

	The Japanese authorities, who were anxiously coerced by the United States, decided to start surveying the so-called "second designated expropriation area" from October 1st, regardless of the fact that the surveying issue from last year was still in the process of trial.

	In the year between the first survey last year and now, the Japanese people's struggle for peace has greatly progressed. "We will not let the stakes be driven into our hearts, nor will we let the stakes be driven into our land!" This is the determination expressed by the farmers of Sunagawa and the Japanese people this year in dealing with the survey issue.

	In order to prevent the survey team from stepping onto the land of Sunagawa, the Japanese people formulated a broad mobilization plan to defend Sunagawa. Led by the "Conference of Labor Unions Supporting Opposition to the Expansion of Sunagawa Base," organized by more than eighty labor union units, the All-Japan Student Federation, the Federation of Women's Organizations, the National Federation of Anti-Military Base Conferences, the Japan Peace Committee, the Socialist Party, the Communist Party, the Labor-Farmer Party, and others jointly formed a liaison conference of Sunagawa Town support groups, deciding to mobilize several thousand people every day during the survey period from October 1st to 16th to provide support and prevent the survey team from entering Sunagawa Town.

	The farmers of Sunagawa themselves built very high watchtowers, and both old and young, men and women, tied headbands with the words "Die Hard" written on them. In front of the door of every farmer's house in Sunagawa Town, there were large flags of people's organizations, labor unions, student federations, and political parties that had rushed to Sunagawa from all over the country, as well as straw mat flags made by the farmers themselves with the three large characters "Non-Compliance" written on them. The Sunagawa struggle headquarters received telegrams like snowflakes every day encouraging them to persevere in the struggle, as well as donations of struggle funds.

	During the two weeks from October 1st to 14th, the people of Japan poured their eyes, hearts, and strength into this piece of land in Sunagawa Town, a suburb of Tokyo. Here, centered on the farmers of Sunagawa, workers, farmers, students, intellectuals, and members of the Diet, etc., who had rushed from the streets, factories, and research rooms of Tokyo, and from Hokkaido and Kyushu, gathered into a huge force of several thousand people. Under the threat of American fighter planes, day and night, they used their bodies to form a wall of flesh and blood, resisting the Japanese authorities' survey of the land of Sunagawa. "Never hand over an inch of land to the United States!" The people united under this slogan, stood arm in arm, and no one could cross this wall as solid as steel!

	The Japanese government's announcement stipulated that the deadline for completing the survey was October 16th. However, due to being blocked by this wall of flesh and blood, the personnel of the official survey team could not step onto the land of Sunagawa Town. Under the coercion of the United States, the Japanese government mobilized two thousand police reservists wearing helmets and carrying pistols and batons on October 12th and 13th, and ordered them to attack this people's wall of flesh and blood. During these two days, more than one thousand people in the people's ranks were lightly or seriously injured, and the land of Sunagawa Town was once again stained with the blood of the people.

	After the police brutality occurred, the people of Japan issued thunderous voices condemning the government. Under the pressure of the masses, the government decided on the 14th (Sunday) to suspend the dispatch of police teams and convened an emergency meeting of cabinet members. On the people's side, in order to resist the final two days of surveying, it was decided to mobilize ten thousand people to participate in the struggle every day from the 15th. On the night of the 14th, three thousand people were stationed in Sunagawa Town to guard against a surprise attack by the police team at dawn. At 8:20 PM on the night of the 14th, the news of victory arrived, and the government was finally forced to decide to cancel the survey work on Sunagawa Town this time.

	The victory of the Japanese people in preventing the survey of Sunagawa land dealt a heavy blow to the US plan to expand bases in Japan. In order to investigate the responsibility for the bloodshed in Sunagawa Town, representatives of progressive political parties such as the Japan Socialist Party, the Japan Communist Party, and the Labor-Farmer Party have now lodged protests with the Japanese government and the United States, demanding accountability and guarantees that violence will not be used against the people in the future. Conscientious people in the Liberal Democratic Party also demand that the Japanese government negotiate with the United States to revoke the decision to expand US military bases. Tokutaro Kitamura, an advisor to the Liberal Democratic Party, expressed his opinion in the "Tokyo Shimbun" on October 9th, saying: "Judging from the current situation in Sunagawa Town, I feel deeply that it is necessary to revise the treaties between Japan and the United States, and at least the US-Japan Security Treaty should be thoroughly revised, otherwise Japan cannot have complete independence."

	Now, the Japanese people are continuing their heroic struggle in the direction of removing all military bases and abolishing the US-Japan Security Treaty and Administrative Agreement. (Attached pictures)

	The residents of Sunagawa Town are united in their struggle, and even the children wear headbands with the words "Die Hard" written on them.

	In front of Gate No. 4 of the Tachikawa US Air Force Base, people form layers of copper walls and iron barriers. "Anyone who dares to pass through the people's wall, just try it!"

    砂川町的胜利斗争
    蓝海
    10月14日夜晚，砂川町响起了“胜利万岁”的欢呼声。日本人民欢喜若狂地庆祝砂川町反对美国军事基地斗争的胜利。
    这一天，日本政府当局被迫决定停止对砂川町土地的测量工作。胜利的消息传来，全町农民和驻扎在这里的“支援队”的工人、学生们一齐欢呼跳跃。他们举起了工会和学生联合会的大旗以及标志着农民斗争的草席旗，形成了无数支队伍，肩并着肩地高呼万岁，相互拥抱，在用自己的血保卫下来的土地上示威游行。砂川町的主妇们紧紧握着工人和学生们的手，流着泪说：“这是你们的力量，谢谢你！谢谢你！”
    游行队伍不约而同地拥向设在阿豆佐味天神庙院内的斗争总部。三千多人把这个庙的院子挤得满满的。在人群中还可以看到一些头上包着纱布，坐着运货手车，由砂川町的孩子们推着来的在斗争中负伤的人。围绕着熊熊燃烧着的营火，三千多人开始高唱“民族独立行动队之歌”。歌声震动了仅隔着一道铁丝网的美国远东空军司令部，使美国佬胆战心寒。
    九点二十分，庆祝胜利大会正式开始，砂川町长宫崎、行动队长青木等当地居民代表，“支援队”的工人、学生代表，以及以社会党书记长浅沼为首的社会党、共产党、劳农党的代表都讲了话。他们一致地宣布了日本人民的共同意志：“我们要团结在一起，一直斗争到废除美日安全条约，一直斗争到消灭在日本领土上的最后一个美军基地，一直斗争到最后胜利为止。”
    砂川町斗争的意义到底在哪里呢？
    美国扩大立川基地的计划，是美国在远东的战略部署中的一部分。美国空军为了在远东准备原子战争的需要，已决定从本年11月开始，把原来配置在日本各空军基地上的F86D型佩刀式喷气式飞机，更换为美国最新式的能携带小型原子弹的超音速飞机——北美F100型佩刀式飞机。这种飞机已经运到了日本福冈的板付美军基地，准备分配到各主要空军基地去。这露骨地表现了美国想把日本当作原子战争基地的政策。
    但是，上述F100型佩刀式飞机必须有九千英尺长的跑道才能自由起落，而目前美国在日本的主要空军基地的跑道只有五、六千英尺长，因此美国就急于扩大基地，以延长跑道。
    去年4月，美国政府利用日本政府财政困难的时机，以减少日本在1955年度负担的“防卫分担费”一百七十八亿日元为交换条件，强迫日本答允扩大立川（砂川）、小牧、木更津、新潟、横田五处最大的美国空军基地。它的扩大部分的总面积达七十万坪。日本政府同意了这个要求。美国国防部已把扩大在日本的这五大空军基地所需的费用列入1956年度的预算，并得到了美国国会的批准。这一年度的预算到1956年6月30日就要结束，因此，美国远东军司令部想在6月30日以前接收土地，铺修跑道，以便按预定计划把原子战争飞机运去。
    1955年，日本政府曾动员五千人的警察队，屡次和保卫砂川土地的农民和工人发生激烈的冲突，使二百十四名日本人民流了鲜血。但是，日本当局花费了这样大的力量，才在砂川的土地上打下了三十个木桩，所测量的土地还不到预定扩充的基地面积的三分之一（当局称这块土地为第一次指定收用地）。砂川的农民面朝着暴力发出呼声说：“尽管木桩能够打在土里，但是打不进我们的心”。转瞬之间，这句话成了日本全国人民的口号。在这种情况下，日本政府企图用金钱来进行怀柔和收买的政策也失败了。今年4月间，砂川的农民把日本政府调达厅送给砂川农民的反对扩大基地斗争行动队长青木市五郎等十七个农民（土地所有者）的“协议通知书”，拿到立川飞机场跑道前面的预定扩充土地上烧掉了，并且当场举行了反对基地斗争的营火大会。
    搞得焦头烂额的日本当局，决定根据美日行政协定，利用土地征用法，强制夺取农民的土地，并命令东京都知事安井发出指令，企图强迫砂川町长宫崎向农民发布公告。而宫崎町长却宣布：“即使把我钉死在十字架上我也不发布公告。”由于没有地方自治机构的首长公告，政府调达厅就不能收用农民的这些土地，东京都知事就以“抗拒发布公告命令”的理由向法院对宫崎町长提出控告。与此同时，砂川的农民以“夺取土地违反宪法”的理由，对鸠山首相提起诉讼。为了护卫砂川町农民的权利，以日本律师协会会长海野普吉为首的一百几十名日本权威的大律师，组织了一个庞大的为砂川农民辩护的阵营。这样，日本人民同政府当局在法律方面展开了斗争。
    砂川的农民和支援他们的人民有着坚定的决心进行这个斗争。
    被美国胁迫得焦急了的日本当局，不顾去年的测量问题还在审判过程之中，就决定要从10月1日开始对所谓“第二次指定收用地”进行测量。
    从去年第一次测量到现在的一年之间，日本人民争取和平的斗争已经大大地向前发展了。“不让木桩打进我们的心，也不让木桩打进我们的地里去！”这就是今年砂川农民和日本人民对待测量问题所表示的决心。
    为了不让测量队踏入砂川土地一步，日本人民制订了防卫砂川的广大动员计划。由八十多个工会单位组织起来的“工会支援反对扩充砂川基地会议”为首，全学联、妇女团体联合会、全国反对军事基地联合会议、日本和平委员会、社会党、共产党、劳农党等联合组成了一个砂川町支援团体联络会议，决定在10月1日到16日的测量期间，每日动员数千人前往支援，阻止测量队进入砂川町。
    砂川的农民自己搭起了很高的了望台，不分老少男女头上都扎上写着“决死”字样的头巾。砂川町每家农民的门前，都竖起了从全国各地赶到砂川来的人民团体、工会、学联、政党的大旗，以及农民自制的写着“不服从”三个大字的草席旗。砂川斗争总部每天都收到像雪片飞来似的鼓励他们坚持斗争的电报和捐赠的斗争资金。
    从10月1日起到14日为止的两个星期中，日本全国人民把他们的目光、心血和力量都灌注在东京郊区砂川町的这块土地上。在这里，以砂川农民为中心，从东京的街道、工厂、研究室，从北海道和九州赶来的工人、农民、学生、知识分子和国会议员等，会集成了几千人的庞大队伍。他们在美国战斗机的威胁下，不分昼夜地用自己的身体结成了一座血肉的围墙，抗拒了日本当局对砂川土地的测量。“决不交给美国一寸土地！”在这一个口号之下团结起来的人们，手臂挽着手臂地站在一起，任何人都不可能越过这座坚如钢铁的围墙！
    日本政府的公告上规定完成测量期限是到10月16日为止。但是，由于被这座血肉的围墙所阻拦，官方测量队的人员一步也踏不进砂川町的土地。在美国的胁迫下，日本政府竟在10月12、13日两天动员了带着钢盔、手枪和木棍的两千名警察预备队，并命令他们袭击这座人民的血肉围墙。在两天之中，人民的队伍里受轻、重伤的达到一千多人，砂川町的土地又一次染上了人民的鲜血。
    警察暴行发生后，日本全国人民发出了轰轰烈烈的指责政府的呼声。政府在人民群众的压力下，14日（星期日）决定暂停出动警察队，召开了阁员紧急会议。人民方面，为了抗拒最后两日的测量工作，决定从15日起每天动员一万人参加斗争。14日晚有三千人驻扎在砂川町，以防备警察队在拂晓发动突然的袭击。14日晚八时二十分，胜利的消息传来了，政府终于被迫决定撤销这次对砂川町的测量工作。
    日本人民阻止测量砂川土地的胜利，给了美国扩充日本基地计划一个沉重的打击。为了追究砂川町流血事件的责任，日本社会党、共产党、劳农党等进步政党代表现在已经向日本政府和美国提出了抗议，并要求追究责任，保证以后对人民不使用暴力。自由民主党中的有良心的人士，也要求日本政府对美国进行交涉，撤销扩大美国军事基地的决定。自由民主党顾问北村德太郎10月9日就在“东京新闻”上发表他的意见说：“从目前砂川町的情况来看，使我深痛感到有必要修改日美之间的条约，至少日美安全条约要加以彻底修改，否则日本就不可能有完全的独立。”
    现在，日本人民正向着撤除一切军事基地、废除美日安全条约和行政协定的方向继续进行着英勇的斗争。（附图片）
