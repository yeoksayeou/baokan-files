Xinhua News Agency, November 1st, Cairo Dispatch: According to Cairo Radio broadcast on October 31st, British jet bombers bombed Cairo at 19:00 local time, dropping incendiary bombs and high-explosive bombs.

Cairo Radio then broadcast: "At 20:50 local time, British bombers attacked Cairo, Alexandria, Port Said, Ismailia, and Suez. Seven people were killed in Cairo, and there was slight damage."

Cairo Radio said that it had notified the United Nations Security Council of the British aircraft's two bombings of Cairo on the evening of October 31st.

Xinhua News Agency, November 1st Dispatch: Paris Dispatch: The French Ministry of Defense issued a statement on the evening of October 31st, stating that the joint Anglo-French air and naval combat operations in the Suez Canal area began at 16:40 Greenwich Mean Time that day.

The British Ministry of Defense also issued a statement at 18:40 Greenwich Mean Time on the same day: "At this moment, bombers under Allied command are launching an air offensive against Egyptian military targets."

The communique stated that the Allied aircraft had encountered resistance from anti-aircraft fire.

In London, the British Admiralty announced that the British cruiser "Newfoundland" sank an Egyptian fast ship in the Gulf of Suez on the evening of October 31st.

Xinhua News Agency, November 1st Dispatch: London Dispatch: The British Ministry of Defense announced in London on the evening of October 31st that the Anglo-French Joint Command had been established in Cyprus.

The British Ministry of Defense said that the British and French governments had appointed British General Charles Keightley as the Commander-in-Chief of the Anglo-French forces attacking Egypt, and French Vice Admiral Barjot as the Deputy Commander-in-Chief.

Keightley had previously served as Commander-in-Chief of the British Ground Forces Command in the Middle East.

Xinhua News Agency, November 1st Dispatch: Paris Dispatch: A spokesman for the French Ministry of Defense said on the evening of October 31st that the French and British governments had instructed their troops in Egypt that the objective of the operation was the Suez Canal area.

He said that the two governments had not specified the means to be used in achieving this objective. The war zone is very large, and the base from which the offensive is launched is quite far from the Suez Canal. Therefore, there may be delays.

Xinhua News Agency, November 1st Dispatch: London, October 31st: A report from the British United Press said that according to information received in London on the morning of October 31st, British and French troops were en route to Port Said, Ismailia, and Suez.

Another report said that since the morning of October 30th, British commandos in full combat gear had been boarding landing craft at Valetta Harbor on the island of Malta. These landing craft carried amphibious vehicles, medium jeeps, field guns, and many motorcycles.

At the same time, troops and military equipment destined for the Middle East are constantly being shipped from British ports and airports. Twenty transport ships are waiting to load outside Portsmouth and Southampton. Two of them have already docked at Southampton to load tanks and heavy weapons.

All British merchant and naval personnel currently on leave have been ordered to return to southern seaports to report for duty.

Xinhua News Agency, November 1st Dispatch: Cairo Dispatch: According to Cairo Radio broadcast on the evening of October 31st, the Commander-in-Chief of the Egyptian National Liberation Army issued a proclamation calling on the Egyptian people to resist the aggressors.

The proclamation condemned the conspiracy of Britain and France to encourage Israel to attack Egypt. The proclamation said: "The people of Egypt, the descendants of those who shed blood for the survival of a free Egypt, the men, women, old and young of Egypt, take up arms to defend your country in danger!"

The proclamation said: "Victory will belong to us, the Egyptian people, because justice is on our side."

"We will join the battle, better to die than to surrender."

Reports from Cairo say that Egyptian residents are prepared to respond to all measures proposed by the government. Cairo and all of Egypt are calm and orderly.

Xinhua News Agency, November 1st Dispatch: Cairo, October 31st: The Egyptian people are extremely angry about the actions of the British and French imperialists and are determined to fight to the end to resist aggression.

Many students from large and medium schools are preparing to volunteer to join the "National Liberation Army" after the schools were closed. In the long lines in front of the new conscription agencies, there are also thousands of women waiting to sign up. Such slogans can be seen on every street: If Britain and France dare to invade us, Egypt will fight to the last drop of blood.

The General Headquarters of the "National Liberation Army" ordered all "dare-to-die corps" members and People's Resistance Army personnel on October 31st to report to their units.

Kamal el-Din Hussein, Commander of the "National Liberation Army," also issued an order requisitioning trucks nationwide. These trucks will transport personnel recruited into the "National Liberation Army" from all over the country.
