Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu. The Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) invited representatives from CPPCC committees and people from all walks of life from eighty counties, cities, and autonomous prefectures in the province to hold a symposium in Chengdu on the 13th and 14th to exchange experiences in CPPCC work.

    At the symposium, representatives from Suining introduced their experience in handling people's letters and receiving people's visits. This year, they changed the past practice of completely forwarding people's letters to relevant authorities through official channels. Instead, they frequently contacted relevant units by telephone or personally delivered the letters to the relevant units. This reduced delays and better facilitated the relevant authorities in improving their work. This year, they received a total of 140 letters from the people, most of which were handled in this manner.

    Representatives from Hechuan, Suining, Guangyuan, and other places all stated at the symposium that holding small-scale forums for different targets is a good way to solve problems. Hechuan City experienced a period of pork supply shortages this year, with citizens queuing to buy meat. The CPPCC Municipal Committee convened a small-scale forum, inviting relevant individuals and directors of agricultural cooperatives to participate in studying the causes of the pork supply shortage and solutions. The opinions were then submitted to the relevant authorities for timely handling. This changed the situation of citizens queuing to buy meat.

    Representatives from various regions also exchanged experiences in organizing people from all walks of life to study. When Meishan County initially organized people from all walks of life to study this year, many people were absent. The CPPCC Meishan County Committee investigated the reasons for their absence and found that some people's study time conflicted with their work time, some had to frequently go to fairs in various places, and some were old and unwilling to study with everyone else, and so on. Therefore, measures such as adjusting study time and using different learning methods were adopted, so that the number of people studying gradually stabilized. Representatives from the CPPCC Fuling County also suggested that appropriately combining visits with learning is a good way to consolidate learning. During their studies, they organized people from all walks of life to visit some hydroelectric power stations and factories, which achieved very good results.

    At the symposium, many representatives also examined some areas in CPPCC work that need improvement. Some suggested that they did not have enough contact with intellectuals in society, and some suggested that the local restrictions on people participating in studies were too strict, preventing some who were willing to study from participating, and so on. Representatives attending the symposium expressed that they would absorb the good experiences of various places and further improve local CPPCC work.

    政协四川省委员会
    举行座谈会交流工作经验
    新华社成都讯　政协四川省委员会13日和14日邀集省内八十个县、市和自治州的政协代表和各界人士学习委员会负责人，在成都举行座谈会，交流政协工作的经验。
    座谈会上，遂宁代表介绍了他们处理人民来信和接待人民来访工作的经验。他们今年改变了过去完全用公文转达人民来信给有关机关的办法，采用了经常用电话同有关单位联系，或把信件当面拿到有关单位去的办法。这样，减少了时间的拖延，并且能够更好地督促有关机关改进工作。今年他们共收到人民来信一百四十件，绝大部分是用这种办法处理的。
    合川、遂宁、广元等地代表都在座谈会上提出：分别不同对象召开小型座谈会，是解决问题的一种很好的形式。合川市今年曾一度发生猪肉供应紧张、市民排班买肉的情况。政协市委员会召开了小型座谈会，请各有关的人士和农业社主任参加，研究发生猪肉供应紧张的原因和解决的办法，然后把意见送交有关机关及时处理。这样，就改变了市民排队买肉的情况。
    各地代表还交流了组织各界人士学习的经验。眉山县今年最初组织各界人士学习的时候，缺席的人很多。政协眉山县委员会分别了解他们缺席的原因，发现有的人因学习时间和工作时间冲突，有的人要经常到各地赶集，还有的人年老不愿和大家一起学习等等。于是采取调整学习时间和运用不同学习方式等办法，使学习的人数逐渐巩固下来。政协涪陵县代表还提出，在学习中适当结合参观是巩固学习的一个好方法。他们在学习中，曾经组织各界人士参观了一些水电站和工厂，收到了很好的效果。
    座谈会上，许多代表还检查了政协工作中一些需要改进的地方。有的提出他们对社会上的知识分子联系不够，有的提出当地对参加学习的人限制过严，使有些愿意学习的人也不能参加等等。参加座谈会的代表纷纷表示要吸收各地的好经验，进一步做好当地的政协工作。
