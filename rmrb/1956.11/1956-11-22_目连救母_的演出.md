The Performance of "Mulian Saves His Mother"
　　Chen Shan

To commemorate the 20th anniversary of Mr. Lu Xun's death, the drama "Mulian Saves His Mother," which Mr. Lu Xun loved to watch in his youth, was performed in Shanghai on October 21st and 22nd. The performing troupe was an amateur troupe from a senior agricultural production cooperative in Xinchang County, Zhejiang Province. The troupe consisted of forty-two members, most of whom were farmers, as well as bricklayers, bamboo craftsmen, tailors, barbers, and militiamen. Among them, veteran actors included Lü Shunquan, Wang Hanqian, Lü Meizhan, and seven or eight others. Lü Shunquan learned to play "White God" (meaning "Living Impermanence") thirteen years ago. He is also a drummer and a key member of the troupe. Wang Hanqian is fifty-nine years old and learned to play "Fu Luobo" (i.e., "Mulian") thirty-nine years ago. His acting has been passed down through four generations. Lü Meizhan is fifty-seven years old, a bricklayer, and plays "Male Suicide."

This play had not been performed in Xinchang for thirteen years. When the "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom" policy reached the countryside, the farmers believed it was also a "flower" and decided to let it bloom. Rehearsals began in August this year, and after forty days of work, the play was performed in the local village on October 9th. In the past, this play would take "seven days and seven nights" (about thirty or forty hours) to complete, and no detail could be omitted. Stone tablets are still embedded in the walls next to the temple platforms in the Shaoxing area, detailing the scenes. If a scene was omitted, the audience would throw stones onto the stage to protest. However, this time, they boldly cut out many episodes. Even so, it still took three days and three nights to perform, with the third night lasting all night. The masses were very interested, and many people brought food and bedding from dozens of miles away to watch the play. Yue Opera actress Fan Ruijuan, upon returning to her hometown and seeing the performance, suggested that the Lu Xun Memorial Committee invite them to Shanghai for a commemorative performance.

In Shanghai, they performed two acts, upper and lower. Besides cutting out many interludes, the content was largely the same as the original story: Fu Xiang, a mean and vicious millionaire in Wangshe City, Henan Province, is awakened by the gods and repents, vowing to do good and ordering his whole family to be vegetarian and worship Buddha. The Jade Emperor, seeing his sincerity, sends a star spirit to be his son, named Luobo. After Fu Xiang dies, the Jade Emperor sends a white crane to take his soul to heaven. He had left a will, asking his wife and children to continue to be vegetarian and worship Buddha, and do good deeds. His wife, Liu Qingti, seeing that her husband still died despite his vegetarianism and belief in Buddha, began to doubt these "good deeds," thinking it better to break the fast. Persuaded by her younger brother, Liu Jia, she broke the fast while her son was away, burned and demolished the temples and bridges Fu Xiang had built during his lifetime, and declared a break with monks and Taoists. As a result, the Heavenly Emperor deemed Liu Qingti as having broken her vows, committed heinous crimes, and ordered the King of Hell to send Impermanence and ghost messengers to capture her and take her to hell to suffer, throwing her off the "Bridge of Helplessness." To save his mother, Luobo vowed to study Taoism in the West and attain enlightenment, receiving the Dharma name "Mulian." He obtained the kasaya and staff bestowed by the World Honored One of the Western Paradise, using them to freely enter and exit hell. After many difficulties and twists, he finally found his mother. At this time, Liu Qingti had been punished by the "Ten Palace Wheel-Turning King" to be reborn as a dog in the human world. Mulian used his magical powers to restore her human form, and the family was reunited.

From the perspective of the author's intention, this play is entirely for "劝善" (admonishing to do good), and it is a powerful work promoting Buddhist karma and retribution. However, due to its long-term performance among the people, and the imagination and processing by the peasants, it naturally added many interesting elements with a strong sense of life that were not originally present. For example, the "Relief for the Poor" scene has an interlude of "Deaf-Mute-Mad"; the "Putting on Mourning and Distributing Food" scene for the dead includes all kinds of ghosts: hungry ghosts, lonely old ghosts, opium ghosts, tiger-wounded ghosts, examination-hall ghosts, and so on. The examination-hall ghosts are a group of underworld scholars, holding pens and writing while floating and swaying on the stage, representing the peasants' satirical imagination of the ghosts of scholars. The Male Suicide is a bald, bare-chested character wearing a red loincloth, with black circles around his eyes. He does not occupy an important position in the plot, but he performs more than thirty athletic movements such as "hanging upside down" and "somersaults" on a several-丈 (Chinese unit of length, 1 丈 = 3.33 meters) long white silk, lasting nearly twenty minutes. It is a very good technical performance that is very interesting. The Female Suicide was a child bride who was sold to a brothel and suffered all kinds of pain before committing suicide. Her image is a large red silk dress, a black vest, a white cloth skirt, disheveled hair, and hunched shoulders, walking crookedly. As soon as she comes on stage, she makes people feel her miserable expression and eerie atmosphere. Her sad howls, angry hair-throwing, and resentment are indescribable, making the audience feel terrified and sympathetic. As Mr. Lu Xun said, this is a "revengeful, more beautiful and stronger ghost than any other ghost." It is said that this ghost should be performed as terrifying as possible, so that women will be so scared that they will never dare to hang themselves again. But this seems to be different from "revengeful"; it seems that the folk creation of this ghost has multiple meanings.

The most prominent, besides the "Female Suicide," is of course the "Living Impermanence," who, as in the past, is still "a snow-white robust man, with a powdered face and vermilion lips, his eyebrows as black as lacquer, frowning, not knowing whether he is smiling or crying... He must sneeze one hundred and eight times as soon as he comes on stage..."

Mr. Lu Xun's article on "Impermanence" is very allegorical. He believes that this ghost is still relatively humane and sometimes shows some leniency. Once, the King of Hell asked him to arrest a "leper" next door, and upon inquiring, he turned out to be his cousin. Seeing his sister-in-law crying sadly, he temporarily released him to return to the Yang world for a moment, but the King of Hell mistakenly thought he was "taking money to release him" and beat him forty times with a board. Therefore, he decided:

"今后可再也不放了! [Note]
Never mind you, copper walls and iron walls!
Never mind you, imperial relatives!"

"Living Impermanence," because of his "frankness, love of argument, and humanity," has won the love of many viewers. In this performance, the new actor Wu Binghong plays him, and he is the same as the Living Impermanence seen on the Mulian stage in the past, holding a banana fan and talking at length, dancing like a duck diving into the water. In my opinion, he really has many other advantages: You see, although he is a bailiff, he wears a pair of straw sandals barefoot, not paying much attention to his status, and he is familiar with the local situation, likes to joke, has funny movements, and speaks in a colloquial and lively manner. When he goes door-to-door in the alleys, the dogs will bite him, so he becomes enemies with the dogs. The "cursing the dog" section, curses for dozens of sentences, cursing all the evil dogs in the world, including mangy dogs and lazy dogs, is truly vivid and incisive. (To be continued)

[Note] “今后可再也不放了!” is Shaoxing dialect; it means "I will never let him go again."

### “目连救母”的演出

    “目连救母”的演出
    陈山
    为了纪念鲁迅先生逝世二十周年，10月21、22日两天在上海演出了鲁迅先生年轻时爱看的戏剧“目连救母”。演出的剧团是浙江省新昌县一个高级农业生产合作社的业余剧团。成员共有四十二个人，绝大多数是种田的，也有泥水匠、篾竹匠、裁缝、理发工、民兵。其中老演员有吕顺铨、王汉钱、吕梅占等七、八位。吕顺铨在十三年前学会了演“白神”（就是“活无常”），他还是个小鼓手，是剧团的主要成员。王汉钱五十九岁了，在三十九年前就学会了演“傅罗卜”（即“目连”），他的演戏是祖辈相传的，到他这辈已经是第四代。吕梅占五十七岁，是泥瓦匠，扮演“男吊”。
    这个戏，在新昌乡间也有十三年没有上演了。“百花齐放”的政策传到农村，农民认为这也是一朵“花”，不妨让它放一放看，就在今年8月开始了排练，经过四十天工夫，到10月9日，在本乡演出。过去这个戏要“七日七夜”（大约三、四十个小时）才能演完，不允许漏掉一个细节，绍兴一带的庙台旁边的墙上，到现在还嵌着石碑，详细刻录着场次，如果少演了一折，观众就会把石子掷到台上去表示抗议，但这一次，他们大胆删去了很多情节，虽然这样，也还演了三个白天和三个夜场，第三晚演了一个通宵才完毕。群众很感兴趣，不少人从几十里外带了饭蒲包来看戏。越剧演员范瑞娟同志回到故乡看到，建议鲁迅纪念委员会邀请他们到上海作纪念演出。
    到上海他们共演出上下两场，内容除了删去很多插曲之外，和原作的故事大体一样：河南王舍城一个刻薄凶恶的百万财主傅相，被神道点醒，悔过行善，命全家茹素礼佛。玉皇大帝看他心诚，就叫星宿下凡做他的儿子，取名罗卜。傅相死后，玉帝又派白鹤接他灵魂升天；他曾立下遗嘱，要妻儿继续吃素，礼佛行善。他妻子刘青提看到丈夫吃斋信佛仍旧不免死亡，对这些“善行”发生怀疑，产生了不如开斋的念头；再经她弟弟刘贾的劝说，就趁儿子出外营生的时候，开了荤，并且烧毁和拆除了傅相生前建造的庵庙、桥梁，宣布和僧道断绝往来。结果，天帝认为刘青提背弃盟誓，罪恶深重，就令阎王差无常、鬼使等把她捉到地狱受苦，打落了
  “奈何桥”。罗卜为救母亲，立志到西方学道，得成正果，法号“目连”，得到西天如来世尊所赐的袈裟、锡杖，凭着这些自由出入地狱，历尽困难和波折，终于把母亲找到；这时刘青提已被“十殿转轮王”罚到阳间变狗受苦，目连使法力让她复变人形，一家团聚。
    从这个戏所表现的作者的企图看，可以说是完全为了“劝善”的，是宣扬佛教因果报应的有力作品。但由于它长久地在民间演出，经过了农民的想像和加工，自然而然又加进许多原本所没有的生活气息强烈的有趣东西。如“济贫”一场中就有“哑背疯”这样的插曲；“成服施食”一场在超度亡魂中，就出现了形形色色的鬼魂：有饿杀鬼、孤老鬼、鸦片鬼、虎伤鬼、科场鬼等等。科场鬼是一群阴司秀才，一面拿着笔写字，一面在舞台上飘飘荡荡地摇晃的鬼魂形象；表现了农民对读书人鬼魂的讽刺性想像。男吊是个光头、赤膊、穿红犊鼻犢、眼眶涂上黑圈圈的角色，在剧情上占的位置不重要，但他在几丈长的白练上表现了“倒挂”、“翻筋斗”等三十多个体育动作，持续近二十分钟，是很好的技术表演，使人很感兴趣。“女吊”这个鬼魂生前是童养媳，后被卖给妓院，受了种种痛苦，结果自杀。她的形象是大红绸衣，黑背心，白布裙，披头散发，耸起肩背歪着走路。一出台来，就使人感到神情惨厉，气象阴森。凄苦地嚎唱，愤怒地甩头发，怨气冲天，莫可名状，使观众恐怖而又同情。诚如鲁迅先生所说：这是一个“带复仇性的，比别的一切鬼魂更美，更强的鬼魂”。据说这个鬼要演得越恐怖越好，可以使妇女们看见了吓得从此再不敢上吊；但这一点似乎和“复仇性”是两回事；好像民间创造了这个鬼魂，寓意是多种的。
    最突出的除了“女吊”以外，当然还是“活无常”，和过去那样，仍旧是“雪白的一条莽汉，粉面朱唇，眉黑如漆，蹙着，不知道是在笑还是在哭。……一出台就须打一百零八个嚏。……”
    鲁迅先生写“无常”这篇文章是很有寄托的，他认为这个鬼物还较近人情，有时会卖点情面，有一次阎王叫他去捉拿一个隔壁的“癞子”，问起来原来是自己的堂房阿侄，他见阿嫂哭得伤心，就暂放他还阳半刻，不料被阎王误会他是“得钱买放”，捆打了四十板，因此他决定了：
    “难是弗放者个！〔注〕
    那怕你，铜墙铁壁！
    那怕你，皇亲国戚！
    ……”
    “活无常”，由于他“爽直，爱发议论，有人情”，所以博得了许多观众的喜爱。这次演出，由新演员吴炳虹饰他，和过去目连戏台上所见的一样，捏着芭蕉扇高谈阔论，鸭子倒浮水一样地跳舞；在我看来，他还着实有另外许多优点：你看他虽然身为公差，但却赤脚穿一双草鞋，不太讲究身份排场，而且熟悉乡里情况，好开玩笑，动作滑稽，语言俚俗生动。当他在里巷间到处串门子的时候，狗就要咬他，所以他就和狗做了对头，当中“骂狗”一节，骂了几十句，骂到天下一切恶狗，也包括癞皮狗、懒惰狗，真是淋漓尽致。（未完，待续）
    〔注〕“难是弗放者个”；是绍兴话；意思是“今后可再也不放了”。
