Xinhua News Agency, 29th dispatch: To date, there are more than 200,000 ethnic minority cadres across the country, more than double the number in 1953.

    The vast majority of these cadres were formerly farmers, herdsmen, handicraft workers, and educated youth from various ethnic minorities. In addition to a number of veteran cadres who have undergone long-term revolutionary training, most of them are activists who emerged from various mass movements after liberation. Some have studied at the Central University for Nationalities or ethnic minority institutes and various training courses in various places. Others are leading figures with connections to the people of their own ethnic groups. Over the past few years, through training in various tasks and with the help of leading Han cadres, they have now become the backbone of leading their own ethnic groups in construction work. Due to the improvement of their political consciousness and their outstanding performance in their work, approximately 50,000 people have become members of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, and approximately 70,000 people have joined the Communist Party of China. Many people have also served as secretaries, deputy secretaries, and members of Party committees at all levels.

    In recent years, the growth of ethnic minority cadres in various places has been rapid. At the end of 1949, there were only more than 10,000 ethnic minority cadres in the whole country, and some ethnic minorities had no revolutionary cadres of their own. Now, every ethnic minority has its own cadres. For example, Korean cadres in the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture in Jilin Province account for 76.8% of the total number of cadres in the prefecture, and the vast majority of leading cadres at all levels are Korean. In Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia and other places, many ethnic minority cadres hold key positions in leading organs at all levels. The Oroqen ethnic group, with a total population of only 2,000 people, already has more than 100 cadres from its own ethnic group. In the Tibet region, more than 2,800 ethnic minority cadres have also been trained in recent years.

    In addition, more than 10,000 ethnic minority cadres in various places hold various positions in professional departments, of which more than 1,000 are students who have graduated from universities or professional schools in the past three years.

    Ethnic minority cadres in various places are very active and responsible in their work. They are familiar with the local situation and are loved by the people of their own ethnic groups. They have established close ties between the Party and the government and the people of all ethnic groups, and have effectively promoted the implementation of ethnic policies and the development of various tasks in ethnic minority areas.

    The growth of ethnic minority cadres in various places is still far from meeting the needs of work development. The existing ethnic minority cadres account for only about 0.6% of the total ethnic minority population in the country, and their distribution is also extremely uneven. Ethnic minority cadres in Inner Mongolia account for 1.9% of the local ethnic minority population, while ethnic minority cadres in Guangxi Province account for only 0.4% of the local ethnic minority population. Among the more than 38,000 Miao people in Guangnan County, Yunnan Province, as of July this year, there were only nine Miao cadres. There are still very few ethnic minority cadres in Party committees and industrial departments at all levels, and there are even fewer cadres holding leading positions and senior technicians. Some areas only make general calls for the training of ethnic minority cadres, but do not take effective measures to boldly promote and use them. Some areas only pay attention to promotion, but lack patient education and training, so that ethnic minority cadres cannot fully exert their positive roles. In particular, some Han cadres still have Han chauvinistic ideological styles that discriminate against ethnic minority cadres.

    Recently, various localities have focused on checking these problems in the inspection of the implementation of ethnic policies and have begun to correct them. The Party committees of some areas have also specifically summarized the past experiences in training ethnic minority cadres and have formulated plans for training ethnic minority cadres.

    各个少数民族都有了自己的干部
    全国少数民族干部已有二十多万
    新华社29日讯　到目前为止，全国各地已有二十多万名少数民族干部，比1953年增加了一倍多。
    这些干部从前绝大多数是农民、牧民、手工业工人和各少数民族中的知识青年。除了一部分经过长期革命锻炼的老干部以外，他们大都是解放后各种群众运动中涌现出来的积极分子，有些人曾经在中央民族学院或各地民族学院和各种训练班学习过。还有一部分是与本民族人民群众有联系的领袖人物。几年来，他们经过各项工作的锻炼，和汉族领导骨干的帮助，现在已经成为领导本民族进行建设工作的骨干。由于他们政治觉悟的提高和在工作中的卓越表现，约有五万人已成为中国新民主主义青年团团员，约有七万人加入了中国共产党，有不少人还担任中共各级党委的书记、副书记和委员。
    近年来，各地的少数民族干部成长很快。1949年年底，全国的少数民族干部总共只有一万多人，有些少数民族没有本民族的革命干部。现在，各个少数民族都有了自己的干部。如吉林省延边朝鲜族自治州的朝鲜族干部，已占全州干部总数的76.8％，各级领导干部绝大部分是朝鲜族。新疆、内蒙古等地的各级领导机关中，都有很多少数民族干部担任主要职务。总人口只有两千人的鄂伦春族，也已有了一百多名本民族干部。西藏地区几年来也培养了二千八百多名少数民族干部。
    此外，在各地的专业部门中，已有一万多名少数民族干部担任着各种职务，其中有一千多人是近三年内在各大学或专业学校中毕业的学生。
    各地的少数民族干部，工作都很积极负责，并熟悉当地的情况，受到本民族人民的爱戴。他们使党和政府同各民族人民建立了密切的联系，有力地推进了民族政策的贯彻和民族地区各项工作的开展。
    各地少数民族干部的成长，目前还远远不能适应工作发展的需要。现有的少数民族干部，只占全国少数民族总人口的0.6％左右，并且分布状况也极不平衡。内蒙古的少数民族干部，占当地少数民族总人口的1.9％。而广西省的少数民族干部，只占当地少数民族总人口的0.4％。在云南省广南县的三万八千多苗族人民中，到今年7月还只有九个苗族干部。在中共各级党委和工业部门的少数民族干部还很少，担任领导职务的干部和高级技术人员更少。有些地区对培养少数民族干部只作一般号召，没有采取有效措施，大胆提拔和放手使用他们，有的地区只注意提拔，而缺乏耐心的教育培养，使少数民族干部不能充分发挥他们的积极作用。特别是有的汉族干部，还存在歧视少数民族干部的大汉族主义思想作风。
    最近，各地在检查民族政策执行情况中，大都着重检查了这些问题，并开始纠正。有些地区的中共党委，还专门总结了过去培养少数民族干部的经验，作出了培养少数民族干部的规划。
