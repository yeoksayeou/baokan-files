Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 17th – The Shangyou Hydropower Engineering Bureau has created a "large-volume concrete pouring" construction method in the pouring of the Shangyou Hydropower Station dam project. According to statistics, based on pouring 33,575 cubic meters of concrete for this project, this method can shorten the concrete pouring period by 38%, and can also save more than 70,000 yuan worth of formwork, steel plates, stones, and scaffolding.

The "large-volume concrete pouring" method involves combining several small concrete blocks, as originally designed, into several large blocks for pouring, thereby accelerating the project progress. Originally, the largest concrete block in the engineering bureau's original design was only 1,600 cubic meters. After using the large-block concrete pouring method, the largest volume reached more than 6,000 cubic meters, which is equivalent to the size of a four-story building. Such large-volume concrete pouring is the first of its kind in China and is rare in the world.

Before adopting this construction method, the Party Committee and the Engineering Bureau at the construction site launched discussions among engineering technicians and workers, and conducted in-depth research and experiments. After formal pouring, it was proven that the quality of the largest volume of concrete block met the expected requirements.

The Shangyou Hydropower Station is being built on the Shangyou River in southern Jiangxi Province, which is rich in hydropower resources, and is a large-scale hydropower station. Construction began in March of last year.

    上犹电站工地创造一种省工省料的施工方法
    新华社南昌17日电　上犹水力发电工程局在浇灌上犹水电站拦河大坝工程中，创造出一种“大体积混凝土浇灌”的施工方法。据统计，以这个工程浇灌三万三千五百七十五立方公尺混凝土计算，这一方法可以使浇灌混凝土的工期缩短38％，同时能够节省模板、钢板、石头和脚手架等价值七万多元的费用。
    “大体积混凝土浇灌”就是将原来施工设计中分成若干小块的混凝土浇灌方法，分别合并成为若干大块来进行，因而可以加快工程进度。原来这个工程局原设计中最大的混凝土块体积只有一千六百立方公尺，用大块混凝土浇灌施工方法以后，最大的体积达到六千多立方公尺，相当于一座四层楼的楼房那么大。这样大体积的混凝土浇灌，在我国还是第一次，世界上也是极少有的。
    在采用这种施工方法以前，工地的中共党委和工程局曾经发动工程技术人员和工人群众展开讨论，并且深入地作了研究试验。经过正式浇灌证明，最大体积的混凝土块的质量，达到了预计的要求。
    上犹水电站建设在江西省南部水力资源丰富的上犹江上，是个大型的水力发电站。它是在去年3月开始建设的。
