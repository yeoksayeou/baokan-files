    Xinqiu Mine Should Overcome Coal Loss Phenomenon
    In the first half of this year, Xinqiu Mine lost more than 11,200 tons of raw coal due to relocating before completing the mining of the site. The mine is also losing an alarming amount of coal because it does not clean up the coal on the site in order to rush tasks. The First Mining Section alone lost 1,970 tons in the first half of the year. Some leading cadres of the mine turn a blind eye to this serious phenomenon of coal loss. This kind of business practice of wasting coal in order to rush tasks is unacceptable.

    新丘矿应克服丢煤现象
    今年上半年，新丘矿因场子没采完煤就搬家，损失原煤一万一千二百多吨。这个矿为了赶任务，场子上的煤扫不净，这种损失也是非常惊人的，仅第一采煤段上半年就损失了一千九百七十吨。对于这种严重的丢煤现象，矿的某些领导干部竟熟视无睹。这种为了赶任务而浪费煤炭的经营作风是要不得的。
