Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, November 11th: According to TASS, the Austrian "People's Voice" published an editorial. The article points out that a so-called "Hungarian Committee" has been established in Vienna. The leaders of this committee are Lauda, chairman of the Austrian Industrialists Association, Mahlerta, secretary-general of the Austrian capitalist party, the People's Party, and Gredler, the head of the most reactionary faction in Austrian politics.

The newspaper continues, "Isn't the fact that Horthy's son and the son of Gömbös, Hungary's Hitlerite henchman, are crawling out of their foreign hideouts and beginning to express sympathy for the rebels, proof of who wants the rebellion to happen? After the failure of the counter-revolutionaries' adventure in Hungary, the clamor of reactionaries all over Europe clearly answers the question: in whose interests are the counter-revolutionaries acting?"

The newspaper wrote in another article: "Cardinal Mindszenty's battle cry, who engages in political activities, is: 'Restore private property, restore the rights of the church and the big landlords'." This is the program of the Hungarian domestic reactionaries who killed many workers' leaders. The demands of foreign reactionaries are manifested in tearing up the Warsaw Pact. The Soviet Union has once again saved the Hungarian people from fascism.

    奥“人民之声报”揭露
    匈反革命分子是社会渣滓
    新华社讯　据塔斯社维也纳11日讯：“奥地利人民之声报”发表了一篇编辑部文章。文章指出，在维也纳成立了所谓“匈牙利委员会”，这个委员会的领导人是奥地利工业家协会主席劳达、奥地利资本家的政党人民党总书记马勒塔以及奥地利政治上最反动的派别的头子格列德勒。
    报纸继续说，霍尔蒂的儿子、匈牙利的希特勒走卒盖姆贝希的儿子从国外的地洞里爬出来，并且开始对叛乱者表示同情，难道这种事实不正说明，谁愿意发生叛乱吗？在反革命分子在匈牙利进行的冒险失败以后，欧洲各地反动派的叫嚣清楚地答复了这样一个问题：反革命分子是在为谁的利益而行动的。
    这家报纸在另一篇文章里写道：进行政客活动的红衣主教明曾蒂的战斗口号是：“恢复私有制，恢复教会和大地主的权利”。这就是杀死了许多工人领袖的匈牙利国内反动派的纲领。国外反动派的要求表现在撕毁华沙条约方面。苏联再一次从法西斯主义手中把匈牙利人民拯救了出来。
