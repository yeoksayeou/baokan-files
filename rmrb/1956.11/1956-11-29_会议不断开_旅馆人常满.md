Meetings Never End, Hotels Always Full
The Northeast Hotel received attendees from 85 meetings in eight months, averaging 333 people per day.

The problem of insufficient hotel capacity for travelers in Shenyang is very serious. This, to a certain extent, reflects the fact that the development of the hotel industry has not kept up with the growing needs of the people. But who knows that the bureaucratic work style of certain leading organs is also one of the reasons contributing to this problem?
According to a joint investigation by the General Offices of the Liaoning Provincial Party Committee and the Liaoning Provincial People's Committee, the public-owned lodging departments in Shenyang City that undertake general reception tasks, including the Northeast Hotel, have a total of five units, which can usually accommodate more than 1,200 travelers per day. However, from January to August this year, they received only 1,812 scattered passing staff members.
So, what were their rooms used for? Taking the Northeast Hotel as an example, from January to August, it received attendees from a total of 85 meetings, averaging 333 people per day. The number of participants in these meetings was generally two or three hundred, and some were as many as seven hundred; the duration of the meetings was generally five or six days, and some lasted as long as eighteen days. Meeting after meeting, one wave chasing the next, the hotel rooms were never vacant, and there was often a problem of overcrowding. For example, the Northeast Hotel and the Beiling Guest House had already booked all the rooms for the entire month to some meeting-organizing units at the beginning of August. In addition, there were meetings of more than 3,900 people from more than a dozen provincial-level departments that were not even on the waiting list.
It should be fully admitted that some meetings are necessary to be held. However, why are there so many, so large, and so long meetings?
The large number of meetings shows that the leaders of these organs are satisfied with using meetings to realize their leadership. They usually do not go deep into reality. When they feel "empty inside," they call their subordinates to report on their work; when higher-level leading organs assign some tasks, they have to hold meetings again to "study together" because they do not understand the situation at the lower levels and are not clear about how to implement them downwards; when problems occur in the work of various places, of course, they have to convene meetings to correct deviations. These leaders are thus deeply buried in meetings.
The scale of the working meetings is so large that they are somewhat like mass rallies, and there are also many mysteries in this. According to a responsible comrade of the Liaoning Provincial Party Committee, this phenomenon profoundly reflects that the conveners of these meetings have a superficial and ostentatious style, and it also reflects that some middle-level leading cadres also have a style of not going deep into reality. It often happens that when these middle-level leading cadres come to the province to attend meetings, they bring a large number of attendants with them. If the meeting asks him to report on Project A, he will designate the attendant who is working on Project A to draft the report, and even directly report on his behalf; if the meeting assigns the task of Project B, he will instruct the attendant who is working on Project B to "take detailed notes and convey them back." The role of such leaders in this kind of occasion is only this.
The above situation shows that those leaders with bureaucratic work styles not only alienate the Party and state organs from the masses, but also create artificial tension in the hotel problem.
After the Liaoning Provincial Party Committee and the Liaoning Provincial People's Committee discovered the bureaucratic work styles of certain provincial-level departments through the above-mentioned inspections, in addition to paying more attention to the actual problems of hotels, they also, in the spirit of truly improving leadership methods, made the following restrictions on the meetings of provincial-level organs: meetings that can be avoided should be resolutely avoided; meetings that must be held should strictly control the number of participants and the duration of the meeting; those who are designated to attend the meeting shall not bring attendants without authorization; all meetings with more than 100 people must be reported to the Liaoning Provincial Party Committee or the Liaoning Provincial People's Committee for approval according to the system.
After Liaoning Province made these regulations in early October and issued a circular to its subordinate units, the situation has improved somewhat.
The hotel problem is not unique to the Liaoning area; the phenomenon of many and large-scale meetings is also not unique to the Liaoning area. Shouldn't the leading organs in those areas where this phenomenon also exists change this situation by starting with streamlining meetings?

    会议不断开　旅馆人常满
    东北旅社八个月内共接待了八十五次会议的与会人员，平均每天三百三十三人。

    沈阳市旅馆不敷旅客需要的问题是很严重的。这在一定程度上反映了这样的事实：旅馆业的发展，没有跟上人民日益增长的需要。可是，有谁知道，某些领导机关的官僚主义作风，也是促成这个问题的原因之一呢？
    据中共辽宁省委办公厅、辽宁省人民委员会办公厅联合调查，沈阳市承担一般招待任务的公营旅宿部门，计有东北旅社等五个单位，通常每日能容纳旅客一千二百多人。但是，从今年1月到8月它们接待的零散过往工作人员只有一千八百十二人。
    那么，它们的房间都干什么用了呢？以东北旅社为例。1至8月份，共接待了八十五次会议的与会人员，平均每天三百三十三人。参加这些会议的一般的是二、三百人，有的多至七百人；会期一般是五、六天，也有长达十八天的。会议接着会议，后浪赶着前浪，旅馆的房间也就永无空闲，而且还时常有人满之患。比如东北旅社和北陵招待所，在8月初，就已经把全月的全部房间，包给了一些开会的单位。此外还有十多个省直属机关的三千九百多人的会议，没有排上队。
    完全应当承认有些会议是必须召开的。可是，为什么会有这样多、这样大、又这样长久的会议呢？
    会议之多说明，这些机关的领导人员，满足于用会议来实现自己的领导。他们平时不深入实际，当他们感到“内里空虚”的时候，就把下级找来汇报工作；当上级领导机关布置下来什么任务，他们又因为不太了解下情，不明确应该怎样向下贯彻，而不得不再次召开会议来“共同研究”；当各地工作发生什么问题的时候，当然他又要召集会议来纠正偏向了。这些领导人，就这样被深深地埋在会议里。
    工作会议的规模，大得有些像群众大会，这里边也是有着许多奥秘的。据中共辽宁省委的一位负责同志谈，这种现象深刻地反映了这些会议的召集人，有着华而不实和爱排场的作风，也反映出一些中层领导干部同样有着不深入实际的作风。常有这样的情况，这类中层领导干部，到省里来开会的时候，身边带着大批随从。会议要他汇报甲项工作，他就指定作甲项工作的随员起草报告，甚至直接代他汇报；会议布置乙项工作任务，他就指示作乙项工作的随员“详作记录，回去传达”。这类领导人在这种场合起的作用，仅此而已。
    以上情况说明，那些具有官僚主义作风的领导者，不但使党和国家机关脱离群众、而且造成旅馆问题上的人为的紧张。
    中共辽宁省委和辽宁省人民委员会，通过上述检查，发现某些省直属机关的官僚主义作风后，除了更加重视了旅馆的实际问题外，也本着切实改善领导方法的精神，对于省级机关的会议作了如下限制：凡可不开的会，坚决不开；必须召开的会议，要严格控制与会人数和会期；被指定参加会议的人，不得再擅带随员；凡百人以上的会议，须按系统分别报请中共辽宁省委或辽宁省人民委员会批准。
    辽宁省从10月上旬作了这些规定，并且向所属各单位发出通报后，情况已经有所好转。
    旅馆问题，并不是只有辽宁地区存在；会议多、范围大的现象，也并不是只有辽宁地区有。那些也同样存在着这种现象的地区，他们的领导机关，不是也应该从精简会议入手来改变这种状况吗？
