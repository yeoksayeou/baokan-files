Xinhua News Agency, Prague, November 3rd: Vienna dispatch: The "Volksstimme" of Austria published a short commentary on November 2nd, saying: "Planes are almost constantly flying in teams from Austrian airports to Budapest. This is not, as official sources say, to transport medicines; if so many planes were used to transport medicines, these medicines would be enough for the whole of Europe. Witnesses believe that hundreds of Hungarian soldiers from the West, officers of the old Horthy army, and hundreds of Hungarian officers and soldiers who had participated in Hitler's army were transported to Hungary. Among these planes, one can see cars of the West German border guards, British cars, etc."

The newspaper said in another short commentary: Salzburg is one of the centers where Americans and Hungarian reactionary exiles lead counter-revolutionary activities in Hungary. When the disturbances just started, Salzburg, this provocation center, intensified its activities. Now this center has obviously moved directly into Hungarian territory. Hundreds and thousands of balloons with provocative American leaflets in Hungarian were released from Salzburg. Spies and saboteurs were sent from Salzburg to Hungary, and weapons and ammunition were also transported. The newspaper pointed out that the American center in Salzburg has now shifted from the stage of preparing actions to directly supporting the Hungarian counter-revolution. Most of the so-called "free radio stations" located in western Hungary, which demand the establishment of "Western democracy" in Hungary, are American mobile radio stations moved from Salzburg. The commentary continued, who in Salzburg doesn't know that the so-called "Hungarian Public Office" in Salzburg is maintained by American money.

    间谍特务和民族叛徒纷纷窜入匈牙利
    飞机不断从奥地利把反动分子运往布达佩斯
    新华社布拉格3日电　维也纳消息：“奥地利人民之声报”11月2日在一篇短评中说：“飞机几乎是不断地一队队从奥地利机场飞往布达佩斯。这并不是像官方消息所说的，运送的是药品；如果用这么多飞机运药品，这些药品就会够整个欧洲用的。目睹的人相信，数以百计的，从西方来的匈牙利军人、旧霍尔蒂军队的军官、数以百计的曾参加过希特勒军队的匈牙利军官和士兵都被运送往匈牙利。在这些飞机中间可以看到西德边防军的汽车、英国的汽车等等。”
    这家报纸在另一篇短评中说：萨尔斯堡是美国人和匈牙利反动流亡者领导匈牙利反革命活动的中心之一。当骚动刚开始时，萨尔斯堡这一挑拨中心就加紧活动。现在这一中心显然是直接移到匈牙利领土上去活动了。从萨尔斯堡放出了成百成千的气球，气球上带有匈牙利文的挑衅性的美国传单。从萨尔斯堡派出间谍和破坏者到匈牙利去，还运去武器和弹药。报纸指出，现在萨尔斯堡的美国中心已从准备行动的阶段转向直接支持匈牙利反革命的阶段。设在匈牙利西部的、要求在匈牙利建立“西方民主”的大多数所谓“自由电台”都是从萨尔斯堡搬去的美国流动电台。短评中接着说，在萨尔斯堡谁不知道，设在萨尔斯堡的所谓“匈牙利公署”是美国花钱来维持的。
