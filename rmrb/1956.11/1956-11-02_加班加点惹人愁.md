　　Section Chief Ke, look, the whole mine depends on "working extra hours" as the key; pit props are lacking, empty cars are interrupted, and mechanical and electrical accidents often cause trouble; rest time is encroached upon, and the leaders seem not to see it; once in a while is excusable, but it goes on for ten days in a row; I ask you, this cadre, do you still want to do this job or not!
    This is a satirical poem posted by workers of Benxi Coal Mine in the mine director's shift handover meeting room to protest the arbitrary extension of working hours. It reflects the workers' aversion to working overtime. Unfortunately, the phenomenon of excessive overtime is quite serious in some factories and mines in Liaoning Province. Some workers in Fushun Longfeng Mine said: "We don't worry about food or clothing, but we get worried when we are asked to work overtime!"
    Why is the phenomenon of extended working hours particularly serious this year? It turns out that after the arrival of the socialist high tide at the beginning of this year, some enterprises and units regarded the government's regulations restricting overtime as "rigid rules and precepts" and no longer complied with them. They neither applied to the local labor department nor obtained the consent of the trade union at the same level, and then they arbitrarily extended working hours. Some factories and mines even allowed workshop directors, foreman and team leaders to decide on overtime. From January to April, Angang Construction Company's Benxi branch worked a total of 21,452 overtime days, of which only 304 working days were approved by the labor department, which is less than 1.5% of the total extended working hours. Once this "rigid rule" was broken, it caused a disaster. Workers in the Angang Transportation Department did not get holiday rest for a long time, and the average worker worked overtime for 100 hours from January to May. Some enterprise leaders also researched many "tricks" to work overtime in disguise. For example, "serial repair," "compensatory leave," "borrowing workers," "exchanging workers," and so on. This method allows workers to extend their working hours without paying overtime wages, and the wages owed are repaid by the enterprise administration. This is dragged on indefinitely. Some people owe too much to repay, so they simply count it as "voluntary labor" and "contributing labor to support" and write it off. This "trick" can both conceal the overtime situation and not be restricted by overtime hours; it can both complete the task and "save" the wage fund, which is really a "win-win."
    What consequences does unlimited extension of working hours bring to enterprises and workers? The Fushun City Federation of Trade Unions conducted a survey in the Laohutai Mine and found that many workers only had eight hours left each day due to extended working hours, coupled with meetings, personal errands, and commuting to and from work, with actual sleep time being no more than five or six hours. 415 people in the entire mine live relatively far from work, and it takes more than four hours to walk to and from work. Workers only have about five hours to eat and sleep after work. If there are any major or minor matters, the rest time will be further reduced. Because of the extended working hours, some workers can't go home at all after work and have to spend the night in the rest room.
    Due to excessive working hours, some workers are so tired that they nod off while eating. The time for cultural and technical studies has also been squeezed out.
    Poor rest weakens workers' physical strength, increases diseases, and increases accidents. In May, the Xicang adit of the Huanren Drilling Mine was the month with the most serious overtime. The number of working days lost due to illness exceeded more than double that of January, and the attendance rate only reached 87.4%. The welding team of the assembly workshop of Anshan Metal Structure Manufacturing Plant worked overtime for three consecutive days and nights. Worker Liu Zhanwu worked continuously for twelve hours, felt dizzy, and fell asleep holding the welding handle, almost causing an electric shock accident. On February 22nd this year, when Liaoning Machinery Factory installed the concrete beam of a crane, worker Wu Yong fell off the beam and broke his right arm because he had been working continuously for fifteen hours and was physically exhausted.
    Overtime also disrupts production order, reduces product quality, and overspends costs. Due to continuous overtime at the Anshan Metal Structure Manufacturing Plant, some workers touched the welding nozzles to the components and burned them. Most of the products produced by the workers in the first workshop of Andong Machinery Factory through overtime were not up to standard. Among them, all the seeders were not up to standard, and the rework man-hours were 1.77 times the overtime man-hours. In the first half of this year, the Fushun Laohutai Mine extended its working hours by 10,448 working days, while the downtime during the same period was as high as 17,350 working days.
    Seeing these extremely abnormal phenomena, we can't help but ask: What attitude do the Party and trade union organizations in these enterprises hold towards this issue? Yes, they have all seen it. However, some trade union organizations not only did not stop it, but instead encouraged everyone to actively participate. Some Party organizations not only did not maintain the Party's policies, but instead supported these wrong practices and praised them for being "active in their work" and "effective in their leadership."
    Since overtime has brought great distress to workers and has had serious consequences for production, it is by no means a good way to complete tasks. We hope that the enterprise administration will actively improve enterprise management and fundamentally eliminate the phenomenon of overtime. The Party and trade union organizations in enterprises, the local labor departments and supervisory agencies should strengthen the supervision of the state and the masses, actively maintain the state's labor protection policies, and resolutely fight to eliminate all illegal overtime phenomena.

### 加班加点惹人愁

    加班加点惹人愁
    卢凤臣
    科股长，你们看，全矿“靠点”是关键；坑木缺，空车断，机电事故常捣乱；休息时间被侵占，领导好像没看见；偶然一次有可原，一连就是十几天；我问你这个干部，还想干不干！
    这是本溪煤矿的工人为了抗议任意延长工作时间，在矿长交接班会议室里贴出的一首打油诗。它反映了工人对加班加点的厌恶情绪。可惜，滥行加班加点现象在辽宁省部分厂矿中相当严重。抚顺龙凤矿有的工人说：“吃不愁，穿不愁，一叫加点就犯愁！”
    为什么今年延长工作时间的现象特别严重呢？原来今年年初社会主义高潮到来以后，有些企业单位把政府规定的限制加点的法令视作
  “清规戒律”，不再遵守。他们既不向当地劳动部门申请，也不取得同级工会的同意，便滥行延长工作时间。甚至有些厂矿车间主任、工段长、班组长都能决定加班加点。鞍钢建设公司本溪分公司1至4月份加班加点二万一千四百五十二个工作日，经劳动部门批准的只有三百零四个工作日，还不到全部延长工作时间总数的1.5％。这个“清规”一被打破，就酿成了灾害。鞍钢运输部工人长时间得不到假日休息，1至5月份平均每个工人加班加点一百小时。有些企业的领导干部还研究出很多“窍门”，变相加班加点。例如“串修”、“代休”、“借工”、“换工”等等。这种办法是让工人延长工作时间后，不发加班工资，欠下的工由企业行政还工。这样一来就无限制的拖下来，有的因为欠的太多，无法偿还，干脆算做“义务劳动”、“献工支援”而一笔勾消了。这种“窍门”既可以掩盖了加班加点的情况，又可以在加班时间上不受限制；既可以完成任务，又可以“节约”工资基金，真是“一举两得”。
    无限制地延长工作时间，给企业和工人带来什么后果呢？抚顺市工会在老虎台矿做过一次调查，发现很多工人因延长工作时间，再加上开会，办私事，上班下班往返路程等等，每天只剩八小时，实际睡眠时间不过五、六小时。全矿有四百一十五人离家比较远，上下班需要走路四个小时以上，工人下班连吃饭带睡觉时间不过五小时左右。如果有点大事小事，休息时间就更减少了。因为延长工作时间，有些工人下班以后根本回不了家，只好在休息室里过夜。
    由于工作时间过长，有的工人疲劳得一面吃饭，一面打磕睡。文化技术学习时间也被挤掉了。
    休息不好，工人体力就减弱，疾病增多，事故增多。桓仁钻矿西仓坑口5月份是加班加点最严重的一个月，因病损失的工作日超过1月份一倍以上，出勤率只达到87.4％。鞍山金属结构制造厂装配车间电焊小组连续加班三个昼夜，工人刘占武连续干了十二小时，头昏眼花，扶着电把就睡着了，险些造成触电事故。辽宁机械厂今年2月22日安装吊车的水泥梁，工人武勇由于连续作业十五小时，体力不支，从梁上掉下来，把右臂摔断。
    加班加点也使生产秩序紊乱，产品质量降低，成本超支。鞍山金属结构制造厂由于连续加班加点，有的工人把电焊嘴子触到构件上烧坏了构件。安东机械厂让一车间的工人加班加点生产出来的产品大部分不合规格，其中播种机全部不合规格，返工工时为加班工时的一点七七倍。抚顺老虎台矿今年上半年延长工作时间是一万零四百四十八个工作日，在同时期停工时间反倒高到一万七千三百五十个工作日。
    看到这些极不正常的现象，我们不禁要问：这些企业里的党和工会组织对这个问题究竟抱着什么态度呢？是的，他们都看到了。不过有的工会组织不但没有加以制止，反而去鼓动大家积极参加，有的党组织不但没有去维护党的政策，反而支持了这些错误的做法，表扬他们“工作积极”，“领导有方”。
    加班加点既然给工人带来了很大的苦恼，又给生产带来了严重的后果，它绝不是完成任务的好办法。我们希望企业行政方面积极改进企业管理，从根本上杜绝加班加点的现象。企业中的党和工会组织，地方的劳动部门和监察机关应加强国家和群众性的监督工作，积极地维护国家的劳动保护政策，坚决为消除一切非法加班加点现象而斗争。
