What Reasons Prevent Our Country's Tea Production from Rapidly Recovering
Lin Xi

Tea originated in China. As early as the "Seventh Month" chapter of the Book of Songs, the scene of farmers picking "tea" (i.e., tea) in the Zhou Dynasty was described. In the Jin and Tang Dynasties, drinking tea became a refined pursuit. The Tang Dynasty recluse, Lu Yu, wrote the world's first tea book - the Classic of Tea - which specifically discussed tea tree planting and tea drinking methods.

China's tea-producing areas are distributed in the vast mountainous and hilly areas of East China, Central and Southern China, and Southwest China, with Zhejiang, Anhui, Hunan, and Sichuan being the main producing areas. The climate here is mild, with an annual rainfall of over 1,000 millimeters, mostly concentrated during the tea growing season. The soil is generally sandy or clayey yellow and red soil, with an acidic or weakly acidic reaction, which is a good environment for tea tree growth.

The long-renowned Chinese tea began to be exported in the seventeenth century. The 1880s were the peak period of tea production in China. At that time, the annual export of tea reached more than 2.6 million dan (domestic sales and tea farmers' own use were not counted), which sold well in countries such as Britain and Russia. However, from the end of the nineteenth century, due to the rise of tea in countries such as India and Ceylon, and the imperialist monopoly of international tea trade, China's tea production suffered a serious blow. Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, the annual tea production was only 3.4 million dan. During the period of Japanese寇and Kuomintang rule, tea had no sales channels, and the bureaucratic capital and feudal landlords exploited the tea farmers at all levels, and lowered tea prices, so that when the country was liberated in 1949, China's annual tea production was less than one million dan.

In old China, a large number of tea gardens were abandoned, with serious lack of plants, and cultivation was extensive, with an average yield per mu of only about 30 jin. After liberation, the Party and the government adopted the policy of restoring tea production, increased tea purchase prices, provided loans to support tea farmers' production, and helped tea farmers reclaim abandoned tea gardens. The yield per unit area of some tea gardens has been improved.

According to statistics from the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Agricultural Products Procurement, since liberation, China's tea production has increased year by year. Taking the output in 1949 as 100, the output in 1955 was 262, an increase of one and a half times compared with the early days of liberation. However, this recovered output is far less than the pre-war annual output of 3.4 million dan, and even more inferior to the highest annual output in history. Today, tea is in great demand in both domestic and foreign sales, and this contradiction is becoming more and more serious with the improvement of people's living standards and the development of international trade.

As of 1955, China had a total of 4,723,000 mu of new and old tea gardens. Due to the widespread aging of tea trees, poor management, and extensive cultivation, the average yield per unit area has remained at about 50 jin per mu. What are the reasons hindering the rapid recovery of tea production in China? Tea is a perennial crop, with large investments and costs that are difficult to recover in a short period of time, so its recovery and development speed cannot be compared with that of general cash crops. This is an objective factor in the slow development of tea production. However, the more important thing is that there are many problems in our specific work of leading tea production.

Since liberation, the speed of grain recovery and development in China has been relatively fast, which is a good phenomenon; however, some areas have simply emphasized increasing grain production, and neglected or relaxed tea production. The yield per unit area of ​​grain in tea areas is generally relatively low, but the agricultural production leading agencies have set excessively high grain production targets, and farmers have to put all their efforts into increasing grain production, and apply more of the fertilizer allocated by the state to tea gardens to farmland. Tea production has been crowded out, and many mature tea leaves are not picked. Some areas have also put forward the slogan of "grow what you eat" to restrict farmers from growing tea, and blindly promoting intercropping of miscellaneous grains in tea gardens is even more common. For example, Chunlian Agricultural Cooperative in Fuyang County, Zhejiang Province, has a total of 360 mu of tea gardens. Since intercropping with miscellaneous grains in 1953, the tea bushes have generally declined and yields have decreased year by year. Chunlian Cooperative produced more than 36,700 jin of tea in 1954, which dropped to more than 28,000 jin in 1955, and it is estimated that it can only produce 22,000 jin this year. Although a part of grain has been harvested by planting in the middle of the tea garden, compared to the two, the cooperative has lost more than 11,200 yuan in 1954 and 1955. Tea has greater economic value to the country. According to the Zhejiang Provincial Tea Working Committee, in the six years after liberation, Zhejiang's exported boxed tea alone was equivalent to 445,608 tons of steel. Therefore, the practice of neglecting and excluding tea production is wrong, and leadership departments at all levels must effectively correct it.

Secondly, tea is a cash crop with strong commodity characteristics, and whether the price is reasonable directly affects the development of tea production. In recent years, the tea purchase price stipulated by the state has increased year by year. Taking 1951 as 100, it increased by 23% in 1955, which has a certain effect on the recovery of tea production. However, does the current tea purchase price have factors that stimulate production, or does it only have the effect of maintaining production? This is a question worth studying.

In the past, when we calculated the cost of tea production, we often thought that tea was a "sideline" for farmers and that there were harvests of other "intercrops," and we did not reasonably calculate the labor costs of picking and making tea, and cultivating and fertilizing, so that the purchase price was lower than the cost of production or the production profit was less than that of general agricultural crops. The unreasonable calculation of farmers' labor costs for picking, making, cultivating and hoeing has been prominently manifested after the tea farmers' cooperativization. According to a recent survey on the cost of tea production in Hongxing Agricultural Cooperative in Lianyuan County by the Hunan Provincial Department of Agriculture and the Department of Agricultural Products Procurement, the labor cost of picking accounts for more than 50% of the total production cost. As a result, the purchase price of red Mao tea per hundred jin is lower than the production cost by four yuan, eight jiao, and six fen. According to materials reflected in some areas: farmers have the idea of ​​"no picking when there is little tea, no picking when farming is busy, and no picking by full labor force"; although most areas have paid attention to weeding and pruning in tea gardens, they still rarely fertilize and replant missing plants. These situations all show that farmers' enthusiasm for growing tea is not high.

The 44,000 mu of old green tea gardens in Puqi County, Hubei Province, were destroyed during the War of Resistance Against Japan, and are still barren mountains. The reason is that the purchase price here is surprisingly low (the purchase price of one jin of high-quality old green tea is two jiao and four fen), and some purchasers even unreasonably discount it by 10% or 20%. In order to effectively stimulate the development of tea production, it seems necessary for relevant departments to further investigate and study the current tea purchase price and make adjustments.

Third, agricultural cooperativization has brought many favorable conditions for tea production, but it has also created many new problems. These problems have affected the development of tea production because they have not been resolved in time. For example, when farmers individually planted tea in the past, they could sell it as they picked it, and they could get cash in time, which made them feel convenient; cooperatives implemented the method of evaluating work and recording points, and did not pre-distribute in time, which greatly frustrated farmers' enthusiasm for picking tea. After tea farmers joined the cooperative, the failure to convert the tea owner's remuneration into prices in time and stipulate phased repayments also affected the enthusiasm for production. In particular, after cooperativization, more rural labor was invested in grain production, and relatively neglected the arrangement of labor for tea picking and tea making. It should be said that the problems brought to tea production by cooperativization are local and temporary phenomena; the key lies in strengthening leadership over the cooperatives, clarifying the guiding ideology of developing multiple economies, and the phenomenon of valuing grain over tea will be corrected.

Actively consolidating existing tea gardens and increasing the yield per unit area are the main measures to restore and develop tea production in the future. At present, the average yield per unit area of ​​tea in China is only 50 jin, but at the same time, there are high yields of 360 jin per mu (the yield of Hangzhou "October Tea Production Cooperative"). This shows that the potential for increasing tea production is great. In addition to replanting missing plants and terracing and renewing old tea trees, the key to increasing production is to do a good job in cultivating and fertilizing tea gardens. Some areas only pick tea twice a year, or even only pick spring tea, pick less or no summer and autumn tea, and are afraid of affecting the yield of the second year. This view is not correct, because appropriately picking summer and autumn tea can precisely promote the vigorous development of tea trees in the second year.

Opening up a large number of new tea gardens and strengthening the picking of wild tea are also fundamental ways to increase tea production. We should invest capital in this area.

Tea is a beverage, so special attention should be paid to improving its quality. At present, except for a few factories in the country that produce tea in foreign sales tea producing areas, it is generally made by tea farmers themselves. Due to inconsistent operating standards and lack of scientific processing equipment, the quality of tea is not satisfactory. In order to improve the quality of tea, in addition to strengthening technical guidance to tea farmers and vigorously promoting scientific tea-making tools, we should also start to establish mechanical tea-making factories jointly by the state or agricultural production cooperatives.

    什么原因使我国茶叶生产不能迅速恢复
    林晰
    茶叶，原产于我国。早在诗经的“七月”篇里，就叙述了周代农民采“茶”（即茶）的景况；晋、唐时，喝茶成了风雅的事，唐朝隐士陆羽，写了世界上第一部茶书——茶经，就是专谈茶树种植和茶叶的饮用方法。
    我国茶区分布在华东、中南、西南的广大山区和丘陵地带，其中以浙江、安徽、湖南、四川为主要产区。这里的气候温和，全年降雨量在一千公厘以上，而且多集中在茶叶生长季节；土壤一般为砂质或粘质的黄壤和红壤，呈酸性或弱酸性反应，是茶树生长的良好环境。
    久负盛名的中国茶，十七世纪起就开始输出；十九世纪八十年代是我国茶叶生产的极盛时期，当时每年出口的茶叶达到二百六十多万担（内销和茶农自用者尚无统计），畅销英、俄等国。但从十九世纪末叶，由于印度、锡兰等国茶叶兴起，以及帝国主义垄断国际茶叶贸易，使我国茶叶生产受到了严重的打击。抗日战争前，茶叶的年产量只有三百四十万担。日寇和国民党统治时期，茶叶没有销路，加上官僚资本、封建地主对茶农层层剥削，压低茶价，以致1949年全国解放时，我国茶叶年产量不足一百万担。
    旧中国的茶园大量荒废，缺株严重，耕作粗放，每亩单位面积产量平均只有三十斤左右。解放后，党和政府采取恢复茶叶生产的方针，提高了茶叶收购价格，贷款扶持茶农生产，帮助茶农垦复了荒弃的茶园，部分茶园已经提高了单位面积产量。
    据农业部和农产品采购部的统计，解放以来，我国茶叶的产量逐年增长。以1949年产量为一百，1955年产量则为二百六十二，比解放初期增长了一倍半。但是这个恢复的产量却远不及战前年产三百四十万担的水平，与历史上最高年产量相比更为逊色。今天，茶叶在内销与外销上都和需要量相差很大，这种矛盾随着人民生活水平提高和国际贸易的开展显得愈来愈严重了。
    我国新旧茶园截至1955年，共有四百七十二万三千亩，由于茶树普遍衰老，经营管理不善，耕作粗放，以致平均单位面积产量停留在每亩五十斤左右的水平上。是什么原因阻碍着我国茶叶生产的迅速恢复呢？茶叶是一种多年生的作物，投资较大，成本难于在短时期内收回，因此它的恢复发展速度不能和一般的经济作物相比。这是茶叶生产发展缓慢的客观因素。但是，更为主要的却是我们在领导茶叶生产的具体工作中存在许多问题。
    解放以来，我国粮食恢复发展的速度是比较快的，这是好的现象；但是某些地区却单纯强调增产粮食，忽视或放松了对茶叶的生产。茶区粮食的单位面积产量一般是比较低的，而领导农业生产的机关却订出了过高的粮食生产指标，农民只得全力投入粮食增产，把国家配售给茶园的肥料也多施于农田。茶叶生产被排挤了，许多成熟的茶叶无人采摘。有些地区还提出“种什么、吃什么”的口号来限制农民种茶，在茶园中盲目地提倡间作杂粮更为普遍。例如，浙江富阳县春联农业社共有茶园三百六十亩，自从1953年间种杂粮以来，茶蓬普遍衰败，产量年年降低。春联社在1954年原产茶三万六千七百多斤，1955年下降到二万八千多斤，今年估计只能产二万二千斤。虽然在茶园中间种而多收获了一部分粮食，但是两下相比，这个社在1954、1955两年中，就少收入一万一千二百多元。茶叶对国家的经济价值更大，据浙江省茶叶工作委员会计算，浙江在解放后的六年中，仅出口的箱茶就相当四十四万五千六百零八吨钢材。因此，忽视和排斥茶叶生产的作法是错误的，各级领导部门必须有效地加以纠正。
    其次，茶叶是一种商品性很强的经济作物，价格是否合理，直接影响着茶叶生产的发展。几年来，国家规定的茶叶收购价格逐年有所增长，以1951年为一百，1955年则提高了23％，这对恢复茶叶生产有一定的作用。但是，现行的茶叶收购价格是否具有刺激生产的因素，或者是只有维持生产的作用呢？这是一个很值得研究的问题。
    过去，我们计算茶叶生产成本时，常常认为茶叶是农民的“副业”和有其他“间作物”的收获，而没有合理计算采制劳力和耕锄施肥的费用，以致收购价格有低于生产成本或生产利润不及一般农作物的情况。不合理计算农民采制劳力和耕锄的成本，在茶农合作化以后突出的表现出来了。据湖南省农业厅和农产品采购厅最近对涟源县红星农业社茶叶生产成本的调查，其中采摘工价占全部生产成本的50％以上，由此，每百斤红毛茶的收购价格低于生产成本四元八角六分。据有些地区材料反映：农民存在着“茶少不采、农忙不采、全劳力不采”的思想；大部分地区虽然注意了对茶园锄草、剪枝的工作，但还很少施肥和补种缺株。这些情况都说明农民对种茶的积极性是不高的。
    湖北省蒲圻县的四万四千多亩老青茶园，在抗日战争中被破坏，而至今还是荒山。原因就是这里的收购价格低得惊人（一斤上等老青茶的收购牌价是二角四分），某些收购人员甚至还要无理地打个九折八扣。为了有力地刺激茶叶生产的发展，有关部门对现行茶叶收购价格，似乎有进一步调查研究加以调整的必要。
    第三，农业合作化给茶叶生产带来了许多有利的条件，同时也产生了许多新的问题，这些问题由于没有及时解决，也影响了茶叶生产的发展。例如，农民在个体种植茶叶时，能够随采随卖，可以及时得到现钱，感到手头方便；合作社则执行评工记分的办法，同时又不及时预分，大大地挫折了农民采茶的积极性。茶农入社后，因为没有及时按产折价，规定分期归还茶主的报酬，也影响了生产的积极性。特别是合作化以后，农村劳力多投入粮食生产，相对地忽视了采茶制茶劳力的安排。应该说，合作化给茶叶生产带来的问题，是局部和暂时的现象；关键在于对合作社加强领导，明确发展多种经济的指导思想，重粮轻茶的现象是会纠正的。
    积极整理现有茶园，提高单位面积产量，是今后恢复和发展茶叶生产的主要措施。目前，我国茶叶单位面积平均产量只有五十斤，但同时又存在每亩三百六十斤的高额产量（杭州“十月茶叶生产合作社”的产量）。这说明，增产茶叶的潜力是很大的。增产的关键除了补种缺株和对老茶树台刈更新外，主要是作好茶园中耕施肥的工作。有些地区一年只采茶两次，甚至只采春茶，少采或不采夏秋茶，采了害怕影响第二年的产量。这种看法并不正确，因为适当地采摘夏秋茶，恰好能够促进茶树第二年发育旺盛。
    大量开辟新茶园，加强荒野茶的采摘，也是增产茶叶的根本办法。我们应该在这方面投下资本。
    茶叶是一种饮料，因此应该特别注意提高它的品质。目前除国家在外销茶叶产区设有少数工厂制茶外，一般都由茶农自制，由于操作标准不一，缺乏科学的加工设备等原因，茶叶的质量是不能令人满意的。要提高茶叶的品质，除了加强对茶农的技术指导和大力推广科学的制茶工具外，还应该着手由国家或农业生产社联合建立机械制茶工厂。
