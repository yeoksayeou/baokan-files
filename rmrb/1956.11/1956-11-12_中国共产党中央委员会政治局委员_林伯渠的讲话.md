Friends, Comrades:

Sun Yat-sen was the first national hero in Chinese history to advocate revolution with a democratic program, and a great pioneer of the Chinese people in their arduous struggle for liberation. Today, as we commemorate the ninetieth anniversary of his birth, we express our heartfelt respect and admiration to him.

Mr. Sun began his revolutionary career in the late nineteenth century. At that time, China was being exploited, oppressed, and ravaged by all the imperialist countries in the world. Foreign imperialist forces colluded with China's corrupt feudal forces to rule China, trying to keep China in a backward state forever. Before the revolutionary movement led by Mr. Sun, there had been the vigorous Taiping Heavenly Kingdom peasant revolution. This revolution was of great significance in the history of modern Chinese people's liberation struggle. However, because this revolution was only a simple peasant revolution without the leadership of progressive social forces, it ultimately failed. Before Mr. Sun, there was also the bourgeois reformist movement of the Hundred Days' Reform. This movement played a significant role in the awakening and progress of the Chinese people. However, the reformers could not see the power of the masses and dared not put forward revolutionary slogans, so they also failed. The revolutionary movement led by Mr. Sun took a big step forward from the cause started by the peasant revolutionaries of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom and the reformers of the Hundred Days' Reform, and opened up a new period for the Chinese people's national and democratic struggle. After the late nineteenth century, China entered a turning point, the old society was about to perish at this time, and the new society was about to be born at this time, the changes were very large, very fast, and very violent. It is not easy to be a warrior who is always moving forward at such a turning point. Those who stood firm at this turning point were those who had sincere wishes to save the country and saw the future of China more clearly. Mr. Sun was such a person. During the forty years of his life devoted to revolution, Mr. Sun constantly progressed with the progress of the times, and finally went from a revolutionary democrat to a good friend of the Chinese Communist Party, and an ally of the most progressive class in Chinese history – the proletariat – in the revolution. Mr. Sun's contribution to the cause of liberation of the Chinese people will never be forgotten, and the Chinese people will regard him as an immortal great man who is forever worthy of commemoration.

Under the leadership of Mr. Sun, the Tongmenghui, established in 1905, clearly put forward a program to overthrow the Qing Dynasty's rule and establish a democratic republic by revolutionary means. This was a new program that had never existed in Chinese history. In the past, there were only two main classes in Chinese society, namely landlords and peasants. Therefore, only programs representing landlords and peasants could be produced. Those who opposed the Qing Dynasty's rule at that time either advocated rebuilding the Ming Dynasty empire or advocated establishing another empire. Bourgeois reformers only advocated constitutional monarchy and not democratic republic. Mr. Sun's use of the program of establishing a democratic republic to call for anti-Qing was a major progress, which was enough to show that he truly represented a new progressive force, namely the national bourgeoisie. The Tongmenghui's program was an anti-feudal program, because this program not only required overthrowing the Qing Dynasty's rule, but also required sweeping away the superstructure of the feudal system in Chinese history, that is, the feudal autocratic political system, and also abolishing the foundation of the feudal system, that is, the feudal land system. The Tongmenghui's program was also an anti-imperialist program, because the Qing Dynasty's rule at that time was not only the superstructure of the feudal system, but also a tool supported and used by foreign imperialism. At this time, some people who advocated using reform methods to save China opposed the Tongmenghui's revolutionary program. One of the reasons they held was that if a revolution was carried out, it would cause foreign interference. However, the revolutionaries headed by Mr. Sun were not intimidated by this possible interference. They firmly believed that if they tolerated this reactionary ruling force supported by foreign aggressors, the Chinese nation could not achieve independence, democracy, and prosperity. They violated the will of foreign imperialism and held high the great banner of fighting for freedom, seeking liberation, and seeking progress on the land of China.

At the time when the Tongmenghui was established, the Western bourgeoisie had already grown old and corrupt, and was facing a serious crisis of proletarian revolution. Mr. Sun saw this situation. Although he was carrying out a revolution in China at that time with the aim of establishing a bourgeois democratic republic, he recognized the justice of the Western proletarian revolution and sincerely sympathized with the tragic fate of the Chinese working people. He put forward a subjective socialist idea, demanding that the democratic republic established in the revolution implement policies to prevent the abuses of capitalism, and regard the advocacy of equal land rights, which was actually anti-feudal, as the content of his socialist policy. At that time, the Chinese people could not correctly understand socialism, but many people had already expressed doubts about the capitalist system based on their incomplete knowledge of capitalist society, especially based on the fact that imperialism barbarously oppressed China. On the one hand, they admitted that the capitalist system was much better than the feudal system in China for thousands of years, and on the other hand, they hoped that the revolution would make China better than European and American capitalist countries, although no one clearly knew how to achieve this. Mr. Sun's subjective socialist thought reflected to a certain extent the great spirit and courageous ideals of the Chinese people.

Mr. Sun called his program the Three Principles of the People, namely nationalism, democracy, and people's livelihood. This program was deeply popular. It united all those who opposed feudalism, opposed imperialist aggression, and sympathized with socialism at that time to fight for the establishment of a bourgeois republic. Although many revolutionaries in the inland had no direct connection with Mr. Sun's organization, they were still influenced by him in their thinking, and the work done by these revolutionaries also conformed to the requirements of the revolution. At that time, there were so many people who supported Mr. Sun and responded to his call, so with the Wuchang Uprising of 1911, the Qing Dynasty's rule was overthrown in only three or four months.

The Xinhai Revolution was a great victory, because it not only ended the Qing Dynasty, but also completely ended the feudal autocratic system that had ruled China for a long time. The feudal autocratic system had long been an obstacle to China's progress. The removal of this obstacle greatly liberated the Chinese people spiritually. Of course, this victory was incomplete, and the democratic republic established in this victory was not worthy of its name, but this name was not another name, it was the name of democracy, with this name, democracy became the orthodoxy. In the past, autocracy was the orthodoxy, sacred and inviolable, and it would be beheaded if violated. Now democracy has become the orthodoxy, and it has also acquired a sacred and inviolable position. Although it is not necessarily beheaded to violate this sacredness, there is no doubt that it will be abandoned by the people. After the establishment of the Republic of China, although the state power was usurped by Yuan Shikai and other large and small warlords, no one supported them, so one after another they collapsed. It can be seen that although the world was in chaos at that time, there was a sense of justice in the hearts of the people. Once the people had further awareness and were organized under strong leadership, they would completely eliminate those dirty and evil things.

In this democratic tide, Mr. Sun continued to play a huge role. After the Xinhai Revolution, he was the first to discover Yuan Shikai's conspiracy to undermine the democratic system. He firmly advocated launching a campaign against Yuan and called for a second revolution. After Yuan Shikai's death, he was the first to call for the protection of the constitution, and carried out an unyielding struggle to seize the fruits of the Xinhai Revolution from the hands of the Northern Warlords. In this struggle, he suffered many failures. The reason for the failure was that he lacked the strength to support him in the struggle. The people who originally participated in the Xinhai Revolution were divided, some could not withstand the failure and retreated, and some even colluded with the old forces. The remaining people who still wanted to make a revolution could not find the correct direction to continue to move forward. Although only a few years had passed, the slogans and programs of the Xinhai Revolution had lost their power to shake people's hearts, and the masses were spontaneously looking for a new road to revolution.

This period was a real test for the great revolutionary democrat Sun Yat-sen. But Mr. Sun was not an ordinary politician, he was able to withstand the test. He had a lofty spirit of patriotism, a keen eye to detect new things, and a decisive will to carry out his ideas. Therefore, in a very difficult situation, after the October Revolution in Russia, he bravely implemented a transformation that adapted to the world trend.

Mr. Sun was encouraged by the October Revolution, not only because he had already held sympathy for socialism in his early years, but also because he, like all patriotic Chinese, saw for the first time a force that truly opposed imperialism in the October Revolution. The October Revolution completely ended the rule of Tsarist Russia and established the Soviet Socialist Republic. This new republic was a thorn in the side of all imperialists in the world. The force hated by imperialism was bound to be sympathized with by the people who were deeply oppressed by imperialism. The great victory of the October Revolution made Mr. Sun realize that if the Chinese revolution was to be victorious, it must learn from Russia. "Taking Russia as a teacher" was a common saying in Mr. Sun's later years. What Mr. Sun said about "taking Russia as a teacher" meant that it was necessary to learn from the way the Russian Communist Party led the revolution, that is, to take the workers and peasants as the main force of the revolution, and to be a friend of the international proletarian socialist revolution on the front of resolutely opposing imperialist aggression forces. At this time, Sun Yat-sen saw that if the Chinese revolution was to be further developed, it must rely on the broadest masses of the people and establish a revolutionary alliance with a broad social base. This was a major shift in Mr. Sun's understanding of the strength of the Chinese revolution. Based on this understanding, Mr. Sun decided to adopt the three major policies of alliance with Russia, alliance with the Communist Party, and assistance to peasants and workers, and reorganized the Kuomintang into an alliance of all revolutionary classes. In order to realize these new policies, Mr. Sun made a new interpretation of the Three Principles of the People that he created. According to this new interpretation, nationalism meant thoroughly opposing imperialist aggression, democracy meant establishing a democratic system shared by the common people, and people's livelihood meant equalizing land ownership and regulating capital. Mr. Sun's ideas and policies received the active support of the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people, because these policies were fully in line with the requirements of the Chinese revolution.

Implementing this transformation was a fierce struggle. Mr. Sun demonstrated in this struggle the brilliance, courage, and lofty qualities of a great statesman. Many people in the Kuomintang had been enthusiastic revolutionaries before the Xinhai Revolution, but they became diehards in the new era. These diehards resolutely opposed Mr. Sun's new policies. They would rather the revolution fail, rather China continue to be a semi-colony of imperialism, than oppose the Communist Party. Contrary to these diehards, Mr. Sun was never reconciled to the failure of the revolution. He recognized that the Chinese Communist Party was the force that enabled the Chinese revolution to develop, and without cooperation with this force, China could not be liberated. He rebuked the diehards who resolutely opposed communism, saying: "If you don't cooperate with the Communist Party, I will dissolve the Kuomintang and join the Communist Party." He asked those diehards: "Do you still oppose cooperation with the Communist Party?" The diehards replied that they would not give up their ideas. Mr. Sun said to them without hesitation: "Then good, expel you from the party!" Several of the friends and comrades participating in this memorial meeting today were delegates to the First National Congress of the Chinese Kuomintang, and they must still remember how respectable Mr. Sun's attitude was when dealing with this issue.

Of course, Mr. Sun's implementation of his new policies was bound to be strongly opposed by the old warlords and old bureaucrats who represented feudal comprador forces. Yesterday they still expressed goodwill to Mr. Sun, but today they immediately turned against him and regarded him as a real scourge. Finally, Mr. Sun was subjected to strong pressure from foreign imperialists because of his new policies. They unreservedly showed Mr. Sun their full ferocious faces. They created public opinion internationally to denigrate and slander Mr. Sun, and attempted to make the revolutionary government headed by Mr. Sun suffer insurmountable financial difficulties. They used their lackeys in China to organize rebellions, attempting to make Mr. Sun unable to stand on his feet even in his own revolutionary base. They even openly threatened him with gunboats.

Mr. Sun demonstrated the spirit of a great patriot in the face of all the sinister reactionary forces at home and abroad. Relying on the resolute support of the Communist Party and the revolutionary people, he quelled the rebellion and resolutely, regardless of everything, embarked on the road to winning the complete victory of the Chinese revolution.

Why did Mr. Sun so resolutely promote his three major policies? Because with the help of the Chinese Communist Party, Mr. Sun clearly saw from his long years of struggle that the greatest enemy of the Chinese people was the imperialism that was invading China, and that the Chinese warlords could only exist by colluding with imperialism. Without the support of the people of the whole country, without the support of international justice, it would be impossible to defeat the powerful imperialist forces and completely eliminate the feudal warlords. In Mr. Sun's speeches in his later years, he particularly emphasized opposing imperialism and warlords, and repeatedly stated that if the imperialist forces were not fundamentally driven out of China, nothing could be discussed. Therefore, the more obvious the imperialists' attempts to undermine the Chinese revolution, the more unwavering Mr. Sun's determination to oppose imperialism and develop the revolutionary movement. And because Mr. Sun had found the strength to resist imperialism, although imperialism was powerful, Mr. Sun had no doubt that the era of imperialism dominating everything at will had passed. In the Northern Expedition Declaration published shortly before his death, Mr. Sun firmly said: "All those who combine military force with imperialism will fail, and vice versa, those who combine with the people to accelerate the progress of the national revolution will win." He warmly called for a national conference to use the strength of the people of the whole country to sanction the warlords who colluded with imperialism, in order to complete China's independence, freedom and unity.

On the one hand, there is the strength of the broad masses of the people, and on the other hand, there is the strength of imperialism. In between these two aspects, which aspect to choose, which aspect to rely on, making a clear judgment on this issue is a fundamental requirement for all patriots. Mr. Sun stood unconditionally with the broad masses of the people, resolutely opposed the imperialist forces regardless of all pressure and temptation, and unremittingly struggled for national independence and democratic freedom. This is the fundamental reason why he became an immortal national hero. We should actively carry forward Mr. Sun's patriotic ideas and revolutionary spirit, and regard it as a precious heritage of our nation.

Friends, comrades, Mr. Sun struggled all his life to realize China's national liberation and democratic freedom. This goal has now been completely realized due to the great victory of the Chinese revolution. The liberated Chinese people have chosen the path of socialism, and firmly believe that only socialism can guarantee China's independence, prosperity and strength. The great victory of socialist transformation has opened up infinitely bright prospects for our motherland. But in order to achieve complete victory in our cause, we still need to make great efforts. There are still imperialist aggressors in this world, and the aggressors will not stop their activities unless they are seriously taught time and time again. The Chinese people are fighting to build their own country and to strive for world peace; no matter when, if the aggressors dare to offend us, dare to undermine world peace, the Chinese people must unite with all the peace-loving people in the world to give them a head-on blow. Recently, the imperialists attempted to create a coup in Hungary and destroy the fruits of the Hungarian people's revolution, and have suffered a shameful defeat. British and French imperialism openly launched a barbaric armed aggression against Egypt. The Egyptian people are carrying out a strong resistance, and they have received the just support of the Chinese people and the people of the world. We firmly believe that the imperialist aggressors will also suffer a complete defeat in the Middle East.

We call on all patriots across the country, including all friends in Taiwan who still remember Mr. Sun's teachings, to unite as one, to work together to build our great motherland, and to work together to defend world peace.

Long live Mr. Sun's patriotic ideas and revolutionary spirit!

Mr. Sun will live forever!

### 中国共产党中央委员会政治局委员  林伯渠的讲话

专栏：

    中国共产党中央委员会政治局委员
    林伯渠的讲话朋友们、同志们：
    孙中山先生是中国历史上第一个用民主主义纲领来号召革命的民族英雄，是中国人民在争取解放的艰苦斗争中的一个伟大的先行者。我们今天来纪念他诞生九十周年，向他表示我们的衷心的尊崇和敬意。
    中山先生在十九世纪末年开始他的革命事业。这时中国正受着世界上所有帝国主义国家的剥削、压迫和宰割，外国帝国主义势力又和中国腐朽的封建势力勾结了起来，统治着中国，想使中国永远处于落后的地位。在中山先生领导的革命运动以前，为了改变中国民族和中国人民所遭受的悲惨命运，已经有过轰轰烈烈的太平天国的农民大革命。这个革命在近代中国人民解放斗争史中有重大的意义。但是因为这个革命还只是单纯的农民革命，没有进步的社会力量作领导，所以最后遭到了失败。在中山先生以前，还有过资产阶级改良派的维新运动。这个运动对中国人民的觉醒和进步，起了显著的作用。但是维新运动者看不见群众力量，不敢提出革命的口号，所以也失败了。中山先生所领导的革命运动使得由太平天国的农民革命家和维新运动者所开始的事业向前推进了一大步，为中国人民的民族和民主斗争开辟了一个新的时期。在十九世纪末年以后，中国进入了一个转变关头，旧社会要在此时灭亡，新社会要在此时诞生，变化很大、很快、很猛烈。要在这样一个转变关头做一个永远前进的战士，是不容易的。在这个转变关头站住了脚的，是那些抱有真诚的救国愿望、对中国的前途看得比较真切的人们。中山先生就是这样的一个人。中山先生在他一生致力革命的四十年间，不断地因时代的进步而进步，终于从一个革命的民主主义者进一步成为中国共产党的好朋友，成为中国历史上最进步的阶级——无产阶级在革命中的同盟者。中山先生对中国人民解放事业的贡献是永远不会被忘记的，中国人民将把他看做是一个永远值得纪念的不朽的伟人。
    在中山先生领导下，在1905年成立的同盟会明确地提出了用革命的方法推翻清朝统治和建立民主共和国的纲领。这是一个在中国历史上从来不曾有过的新纲领。从前中国社会上主要只有两个阶级，就是地主和农民。因此只能产生代表地主和农民的纲领。那时反对清朝统治的人不是主张重建明朝帝国，就是主张另外建立一个帝国。资产阶级改良派也只主张君主立宪而不主张民主共和。中山先生用建立民主共和国的纲领来号召反清，这是一个重大的进步，足以说明他确实代表了一个新的进步的势力，即民族资产阶级。同盟会的纲领是一个反封建的纲领，因为这个纲领不仅要求推翻清朝统治，而且要求扫除中国历史上的封建制度的上层建筑物，即封建专制的政治制度，还要废除封建制度的基础，即封建主义的土地制度。同盟会的纲领也是一个反对帝国主义的纲领，因为当时的清朝统治不仅是封建制度的上层建筑物，而且是外国帝国主义所支持和利用的工具。这时候有些主张用改良办法来救中国的人反对同盟会的革命纲领，他们所持的理由里面有一条说，如果进行革命，就会引起外国势力的干涉。但是以中山先生为首的革命派没有为这种可能引起的干涉所吓倒，他们坚决认定，如果容忍这个为外国侵略者所支持的反动统治势力，中国民族就不能实现独立、民主和富强。他们违反了外国帝国主义的意愿，在中国的国土上高高地举起了争自由、求解放、求进步的伟大的旗帜。
    在同盟会成立的时候，这个时期西方资产阶级已经衰老了、腐朽了，并且面临着无产阶级革命的严重危机。中山先生看到了这种情形。虽然他当时在中国进行着以建立资产阶级民主共和国为目的的革命，但是他承认西方无产阶级革命的正义性，并且恳切地同情中国劳动人民的悲惨命运。他提出了一种主观的社会主义思想，要求在革命中建立起来的民主共和国实行预防资本主义流弊的政策，把实际上是反封建的平均地权的主张作为他的社会主义政策的内容。当时中国人民还不能正确地理解社会主义，但是已经有很多人根据他们对于资本主义社会的不完全的知识，特别是根据帝国主义野蛮地压迫中国的事实而对资本主义制度表示怀疑。他们一方面承认资本主义制度要比中国几千年来的封建制度好得多，一方面又希望革命将使中国变得比欧美资本主义国家更好一些，虽然还没有人明确知道，究竟怎样才能做到这一点。中山先生的主观社会主义思想在一定程度上反映了中国人民的这种伟大的气概和勇敢的理想。
    中山先生把他的纲领称为三民主义，即民族主义、民权主义和民生主义。这个纲领是深得人心的。它团结了当时一切反对封建主义的、反对帝国主义侵略的和同情社会主义的人们，来为建立资产阶级共和国而奋斗。内地有许多革命分子虽然同中山先生的团体没有直接的联系，可是在思想上还是受他的影响，而这些革命分子所做的工作也是符合于革命要求的。当时拥护中山先生和响应他的号召的人是如此众多，所以辛亥武昌义旗一举，只有三四个月就把清朝统治推翻了。
    辛亥革命是一个伟大的胜利，因为它不仅结束了清朝一个朝代，而且整个地结束了长时期统治中国的封建专制制度。封建专制制度早已是中国进步的障碍。这个障碍的消除，使中国人民在精神上大大地获得了解放。当然，这个胜利是不彻底的，在这个胜利中建立起来的民主共和国是名不符实的，但是这个名不是别的名，是民主主义的名，有了这个名，就是民主主义成了正统。过去专制主义是正统，神圣不可侵犯，侵犯了就要杀头。现在民主主义成了正统，同样取得了神圣不可侵犯的地位，侵犯了这个神圣固然未必就要杀头，但为人民所抛弃是没有疑问的。在中华民国成立以后，国家政权虽然被袁世凯和其他大小军阀所篡夺，但是没有人支持他们，所以一个一个都垮台了。可见当时天下尽管乱，在人民的心里，自有一个公道。一到人民有了进一步的觉悟，在坚强的领导下组织起来的时候，就会要把那些污秽恶浊的东西彻底消灭的。
    在这个民主潮流中，中山先生继续起着巨大的作用。他在辛亥革命以后首先发现袁世凯破坏民主制度的阴谋，坚决主张发动讨袁，号召实行第二次革命。在袁世凯死后，他又首先号召护法，为从北洋军阀手里夺回辛亥革命的果实进行了不屈不挠的斗争。在这个斗争中，他遭到了多次的失败。失败的原因是他缺少支持他进行斗争的力量。原来参加辛亥革命的人内部发生了分化，有的禁受不住失败而退却了，有的甚至和旧势力同流合污了，剩下来还想革命的人也找不到继续前进的正确方向。时间虽然相隔不过几年，但是辛亥革命的口号和纲领已经失去了震动人心的力量，群众也在自发地寻找着革命的新道路。
    这个时期对于伟大的革命民主主义者孙中山先生说来，是一个真正的考验。但是中山先生不是一个普通的政治家，他是受得起考验的。他有爱国主义的崇高的精神，有觉察新鲜事物的敏锐的眼光，有贯彻他的主张的果断的毅力，所以他在非常困苦的境地里面，在俄国十月革命以后，勇敢地实行了一个适应世界潮流的转变。
    中山先生从十月革命感受到鼓舞，不仅因为他早年就已经抱着对于社会主义的同情，而且因为他同一切爱国的中国人一样，在十月革命中第一次看到了一个真正同帝国主义相对立的力量。十月革命彻底结束了沙皇俄国的统治，建立了苏维埃社会主义共和国。这个新的共和国是世界上一切帝国主义者的眼中钉。为帝国主义所仇视的力量，必然得到身受帝国主义压迫的人民的同情。十月革命的伟大胜利使中山先生觉悟到要中国革命得到胜利，必须学俄国。“以俄为师”，是中山先生晚年一句常说的话。中山先生所说的“以俄为师”，就是说，要师法俄国共产党领导革命的方式，即以工农群众为革命主力的方式，并且在坚决反对帝国主义侵略势力的战线上做国际无产阶级社会主义革命的朋友。孙中山先生这时看出，中国革命要得到进一步的发展，就必须依靠最广大的人民群众，并且建立一个有广泛社会基础的革命联盟。这是中山先生对于中国革命力量的认识的一个大转变。根据这个认识，中山先生决定采取联俄、联共和扶助农工三大政策，改组国民党为各革命阶级的联盟。为了实现这些新政策，中山先生对他所创造的三民主义作了新的解释。按照这个新解释，民族主义就是彻底地反对帝国主义侵略，民权主义就是建立为平民所共有的民主制度，民生主义就是平均地权和节制资本。中山先生的这些主张和政策获得了中国共产党和中国人民的积极支持，因为这些政策是完全符合于中国革命的要求的。
    实行这个转变是一场猛烈的斗争。中山先生在这个斗争中表现了作为伟大政治家的英明、勇敢和爱国的崇高品质。国民党里面有很多人在辛亥革命以前曾经是热烈的革命者，可是他们在新的时期中变成了顽固分子。这些顽固分子坚决反对中山先生的新政策。他们宁愿革命失败，宁愿中国继续做帝国主义的半殖民地，也要反对共产党。同这些顽固分子相反，中山先生决不甘心革命的失败。他认定中国共产党是使中国革命获得发展的力量，不同这个力量合作就得不到中国的解放。他斥责坚决反共的顽固分子说：“你们不同共产党合作，我就解散国民党，加入共产党。”他问那些顽固分子说：“你们仍旧反对同共产党合作么？”顽固分子回答说，他们不肯放弃自己的主张。中山先生就毫不迟疑地对他们说：“那么好，开除你们的党籍！”今天参加这个纪念会的朋友们和同志们里面，有好几位是中国国民党第一次全国代表大会的出席代表，一定都还记得，中山先生在处理这个问题的时候所表现的态度何等令人可敬。
    中山先生实行他的新政策，当然也不能不受到代表封建买办势力的旧军阀、旧官僚的强烈反对。他们昨天还向中山先生表示好感，今天立刻反面无情，把他看成了真正的洪水猛兽。最后，中山先生更因为他的新政策而受到了外国帝国主义者的强大压力。他们毫不掩饰地向中山先生露出了全付狰狞面目。他们在国际间制造舆论，诋毁和诬蔑中山先生，并企图从财政上使以中山先生为首的革命政府遭受不可克服的困难。他们利用他们在中国的走狗，组织叛变，企图使中山先生甚至在自己的革命根据地里面都立不住脚。他们甚至公开用炮舰来威胁他。
    中山先生在国内外一切凶恶的反动势力面前，表现了伟大的爱国者的气概。他依靠共产党和革命人民的坚决支持削平了叛乱，断然地、不顾一切地走上了争取中国革命彻底胜利的道路。
    为什么中山先生如此坚决地推行他的三大政策呢？因为在中国共产党帮助下，中山先生根据长期奋斗的经验清楚地看出了中国人民的最大敌人就是侵略中国的帝国主义，而中国的军阀只有勾结帝国主义才能存在。如果没有全国人民的支持，如果没有国际正义的支持，要战胜强大的帝国主义势力，彻底扫清封建军阀，是不可能的。在中山先生晚年的言论中特别强调反对帝国主义和军阀，反复申说，如果不从根本上把帝国主义势力赶出中国去，一切都谈不到。所以帝国主义破坏中国革命的企图越是显著，中山先生的反对帝国主义和发展革命运动的决心也越是坚定不移。而因为中山先生已经找到了足以对抗帝国主义的力量，所以帝国主义虽然强大，但是中山先生毫不怀疑，帝国主义为所欲为地支配一切的时代是已经过去了。在逝世前不久发表的北上宣言中，中山先生坚定地说：“凡武力与帝国主义结合者无不败，反之，与国民结合以速国民革命之进行者无不胜”。他热烈地号召举行国民会议，用全国人民的力量来制裁与帝国主义相勾结的军阀，以完成中国的独立、自由和统一。
    一方面是广大人民的力量，一方面是帝国主义的力量。在这两方面中间，究竟选择哪一方面，依靠哪一方面，在这问题上做出明确的判断，是对于一切爱国者的一个根本要求。中山先生无条件地同广大人民站在一起，不顾一切压力和诱惑而同帝国主义势力坚决对立，始终不懈地为争取民族独立和民主自由而斗争，这就是他所以成为不朽的民族英雄的根本所在。我们应当积极发扬中山先生的这种爱国思想和革命精神，把它当作我们民族的珍贵遗产。
    朋友们，同志们，中山先生一生为实现中国的民族解放和民主自由而斗争，这个目的现在已经由于中国革命的伟大胜利而彻底实现了。解放了的中国人民已经选定了社会主义的道路，深信只有社会主义才能保障中国的独立、繁荣和富强。社会主义改造的伟大胜利已经为我们的祖国开辟了无限光明的远景。但是为了使我们的事业达到完全的胜利还需要做很大的努力。在这世界上还有帝国主义侵略者，侵略者不是一次次受到严重的教训是不会停止它的活动的。中国人民为建设自己的国家，为争取世界和平而斗争；不管是在什么时候侵略者如果敢于触犯我们，敢于破坏世界和平，中国人民一定要同全世界爱好和平的人民一致给以迎头痛击。最近，帝国主义者在匈牙利企图制造政变，摧毁匈牙利人民革命的成果，已经遭遇了可耻的失败。英法帝国主义公然向埃及发动野蛮的武力侵略。埃及人民正在进行着坚强的抵抗，他们得到了中国人民和全世界人民的正义的支持。我们深信，帝国主义侵略者在中东也一定会遭到彻底的失败。
    我们号召全国一切爱国者，包括在台湾的一切还记得中山先生遗训的朋友们一致团结起来，为建设我们的伟大的祖国而共同努力，为保卫世界和平而共同努力。
    中山先生的爱国思想和革命精神万岁！
    中山先生永垂不朽！
