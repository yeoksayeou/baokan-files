Wuxi Silk Reeling Industry Wages Are Unreasonable

Zhu Yuanxin

Since 1954, an abnormal phenomenon has appeared in the silk reeling industry of Wuxi City: enterprises have overfulfilled their plans, but workers generally fail to meet their production quotas and often cannot receive the national standard wage. Last year, for example, the total output value plan of the city's fourteen silk factories was completed at over 120%, but the labor wage plan was only 98%, resulting in 180,000 yuan less in wages paid, which was submitted as enterprise profit. From January to September of this year, output value plans, production plans, quality plans, and raw material saving plans have all been overfulfilled, but the wage plan has only been completed at 98.5%, with an average monthly wage of less than forty yuan per worker, more than two yuan less than the national standard wage. In August of this year, only 18% of the workers in the locally-run state silk factory received the standard wage. One worker took sick leave for the first half of the month and received twenty-two yuan in sick leave pay. When he returned to work in the second half of the month, he only received twenty yuan in wages because he failed to meet the quota. Workers reflected, "Working is not as good as taking sick leave!" In June of this year, due to high quotas, the absenteeism rate at this factory reached 17%, and twenty-one machines were idle because no one was operating them.

The reasons why workers cannot receive reasonable remuneration with the improvement of production are mainly:

First, the processing quota indicators are unreasonable. All silk factories in Wuxi City process for the Silk Company. The Silk Company uses a sample factory to determine the processing quota indicators for different raw materials, which are used as the basis for calculating processing fees. The equipment, raw materials, technical strength, and other conditions of the sample factory are better than those of general processing factories, and it is small-batch sampling. In production, processing factories not only have longer raw material storage times, but also have varying machine equipment and worker skill levels. Especially since this year, a large number of sitting-reeling workers have been converted to standing-reeling workers, and their technical level has relatively declined. Therefore, the processing quota determined by the sample factory is actually high, while the actual production performance of the processing factory is low. Enterprise administrative cadres have repeatedly reported to relevant departments, requesting a solution. The Silk Company replied, "Measures should be strengthened to fully utilize the performance of raw materials and safeguard national interests."

Each silk factory bases the completion of the enterprise's financial cost plan entirely on the labor quota of the workers. When formulating production quotas, each factory does not select representative workers for in-factory sampling based on the factory's production conditions and the technical level of the workers and then determine the production quota; instead, it dispatches advanced workers to serve as samplers and also dispatches technicians to provide specific guidance, creating many favorable conditions from all aspects to make the in-factory sampling results meet the processing quota indicators, resulting in excessively high production quotas.

The conditions for in-factory sampling workers are already much better than those of actual reeling workers, but some enterprises often add "advanced factors" on the basis of the sampling results to increase the quota under the slogan of "opposing conservatism." As a result, the quota is even more divorced from reality. In the first half of this year, workers in the locally-run state-owned silk factory No. 2 generally learned advanced experience, and the plan was completed well, with more than six thousand yuan in extra wages paid to workers. In August, administrative leaders blindly raised the quota on the grounds of completing the financial plan, resulting in 82% of the workers failing to meet the quota. Such incidents are not isolated, so some workers say, "Advanced experience is promoted, production is improved, but wages are reduced."

Second, the production characteristics of silk factories are that raw materials are variable and semi-manual operations are involved. Enterprise management and technical measures cannot adapt to this characteristic, and workers have no way of knowing the performance and characteristics of raw materials and changing operating methods in a timely manner. Sometimes, although the quota is reasonable, workers still fail to meet the quota and reduce their income due to reasons such as untimely technical measures.

Third, the method of calculating piece-rate wages is somewhat unreasonable. Silk reeling workers calculate piece-rate wages based on many items with complex methods. It includes output, raw material consumption, and quality. Quality includes evenness and fineness; fineness includes average fineness, single-skein fineness, and fineness difference, almost including the main technical and economic indicators of silk reeling production. If any one of these items fails to meet the quota, wages are deducted. In terms of raw material consumption, although wages are increased or decreased in form, many factors affect the amount of raw material consumption. For example, inappropriate control of temperature and humidity in the workshop and poor cocoon cooking quality will increase raw material consumption. This should not be the responsibility of silk reeling workers, but in the calculation of wages, all responsibility is borne by the silk reeling workers.

The above-mentioned phenomena not only exist in the silk reeling industry in Wuxi City but also exist in other parts of Jiangsu. In late September, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and the National Textile Trade Union sent a working group to investigate and put forward improvement suggestions. The Jiangsu Provincial Silk Industry Bureau has also made preliminary improvement plans. We hope that relevant departments will attach importance to this issue and improve it quickly and reasonably.

    无锡缫丝工业工资不合理
    朱源鑫
    从1954年以来，无锡市缫丝工业中出现了一种反常现象：企业计划超额完成了，工人却普遍达不到生产定额，经常拿不到国家规定的标准工资。以去年来说，全市十四家丝厂生产总值计划完成120％以上，但劳动工资计划仅完成98％，少支出工资十八万多元，被作为企业利润上缴了。今年1到9月，产值计划、产量计划、质量计划、节约原料计划等都超额完成，而工资计划只完成98.5％，平均每个工人每月的工资不到四十元，比国家规定的标准工资少两元多。今年8月份，地方国营缫丝厂只有18％的工人拿到标准工资，有一个工人上半月因病请假，得到病假工资二十二元，下半月上班，因完不成定额只拿到二十元工资。工人反映：“做工还不如请病假好！”这个厂在今年6月份，因为定额高，工人缺勤率达17％，有二十一台机器因为无人挡车而停工。
    工人们不能随着生产的提高得到合理的报酬的原因，主要是：
    一、加工定额指标不合理。无锡市所有的缫丝厂都为丝绸公司加工。丝绸公司通过试样厂确定不同原料的加工定额指标，作为计算加工费的依据。试样工厂的设备、原料、技术力量等各方面的条件都比一般加工厂优越，而且是小批试样。加工厂在生产时不仅原料堆放时间长，而且机器设备、工人技术熟练程度不一，特别今年以来，大批坐缫工人转为立缫工人，技术水平相对下降。因此，实际上是试样厂确定的加工定额高，而加工厂实缫的生产成绩低。企业行政干部曾多次向有关部门反映，要求解决。缫丝绸公司却回答说：“应该加强措施，充分发挥原料性能，维护国家利益。”
    各缫丝厂把完成企业的财务成本计划完全建立在工人的劳动定额上。各厂在制订生产定额时，不是根据本厂的生产条件和工人技术水平，选择带有代表性的工人进行厂内试样，然后确定生产定额；而是抽调先进工人担任试样，并且还抽调技术人员进行具体指导，从各方面创造许多有利条件，使厂内试样成绩能符合加工定额指标的要求，因而生产定额偏高。
    厂内试样工人的条件已经较实缫工人好得多，但是，有些企业往往还在“反对保守”的口号下，在试样成绩的基础上再加上“先进因素”来提高定额。结果，定额更加脱离实际。地方国营缫丝二厂今年上半年工人普遍学习了先进经验，计划完成较好，工人工资多支出了六千多元。8月份，行政领导便以完成财务计划为理由，盲目提高定额，结果82％的工人达不到定额。像这种事例，并不是个别的，所以有的工人说：“先进经验推广了，生产提高了，工资反而降低了。”
    二、缫丝厂的生产特点是原料多变，又是半手工操作，企业管理和技术措施不能适应这个特点，工人没法知道原料性能和特点及时改变操作方法。有时定额虽然合理，但由于技术措施下达不及时等原因，工人仍然达不到定额而降低了收入。
    三、计算计件工资的办法有些不合理。缫丝工人计算计件工资的内容多，办法复杂。它包括产量、原料耗用、质量。在质量中又包括匀度、纤度二项；在纤度中还要包括平均纤度、单绞纤度和纤度差异等，几乎包括了缫丝生产的主要技术经济指标。这些项目，只要一项达不到定额，便被扣除工资。在原料耗用方面，在形式上虽然是工资有增有减，但是影响原料耗用多少的因素很多。如车间温湿度控制不适当和煮茧质量不好都会多耗用原料，这本来不应由缫丝工人负责，但在计算工资时，却全部由缫丝工人负责。
    上述现象不仅在无锡市缫丝工业中存在，在江苏其他各地也存在。九月下旬，中华全国总工会和全国纺织工会曾派工作组去调查，并提出了改进意见。江苏省丝绸工业局也作出了初步改进方案。我们希望有关部门都重视这个问题，迅速地合理地给以改进。
