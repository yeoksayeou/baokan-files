　　Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, 27th: The workers of the state-owned Handan No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory saved the country 19,643.5 jin (market pounds) of cotton in the four months from July to October this year. In October, the cotton (raw cotton) used for each yarn count was reduced to 194.79 kilograms, which was 0.71 kilograms less than the state-prescribed target. The quality of the cotton yarn has also improved significantly.

　　This is because the factory leadership, through specific analysis and the organization of planning staff to carefully calculate accounts, found many reasons affecting the amount of cotton saved, and at the same time, improved many equipment in key workshops.

    节省原棉
    据新华社保定27日电　国营邯郸第一棉纺织厂职工，在今年7月到10月的四个月中，给国家节省了一万九千六百四十三斤半（市斤）棉花。在10月份里，一件纱的统扯用棉（生棉）已经降低到一百九十四点七九公斤，比国家规定指标减少了零点七一公斤。棉纱的质量也有显著提高。
    这是由于工厂领导方面经过具体分析和组织计划工作人员用算细账的方法，找出了许多影响节约用棉量的原因，同时在重点车间改进了许多设备的结果。
