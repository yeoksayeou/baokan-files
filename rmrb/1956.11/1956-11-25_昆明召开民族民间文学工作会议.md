Kunming Holds Conference on Ethnic and Folk Literature

(Our dispatch) In order to better excavate and collate ethnic folk literature, the Kunming branch of the Chinese Writers Association convened a conference on ethnic folk literature work on the 20th of this month. The conference is tentatively scheduled for six days. The representatives attending the conference include thirteen ethnic groups (including ethnic branches) such as Dai, Bai, Yi, Hani, Sani, Naxi, Axi, Lisu, Jingpo, Miao, Tibetan, Hui, and Han. Among them are Kang Langshuai, a famous Dai singer from Xishuangbanna; Li San and Huang Dangfa, Yi folk artists from Yuanyang County; Naxi youth Niu Xiangkui and Mu Lichun, who collated the Naxi folk story poem "Jade Dragon Third Kingdom"; and Miao Lugfu'er·Zhameng, one of the collators of the Miao folk story poem "Red Zhao and Rao Cuo Xi Na." In addition, there are cadres engaged in cultural work and intellectuals from various ethnic groups. Yunnan is a multi-ethnic region with extremely rich folk literature from various ethnic groups. There is a thirteen-year-old girl named Wu Fenglan who can recite a thousand folk songs and has also composed many new lyrics singing about the new life. After the Sani folk story poem "Ashima" was collated, it attracted the attention of readers at home and abroad. According to preliminary understanding, almost every ethnic group in Yunnan has their own "Ashima," the question is how to unearth it. The purpose of this conference is to summarize the work of ethnic literature in Yunnan Province in recent years, to further understand the details of folk literature of various ethnic groups, to formulate a work plan for next year, and to deliberate on a plan for the next twelve years.

    昆明召开民族民间文学工作会议
    本报讯　为了更好的发掘整理民族民间文学，中国作家协会昆明分会于本月20日召开了民族民间文学工作会议。会期暂定为六天。出席会议的代表，包括傣、白、彝、哈尼、撒尼、纳西、阿细、傈僳、景颇、苗、藏、回、汉等十三个民族（包括民族支系）。其中有西双版纳有名的傣族歌手康朗甩、元阳县彝族民间艺人李三、黄当发，纳西族民间故事诗“玉龙第三国”的整理者纳西青年牛相奎、木丽春，苗族民间故事诗“红昭和饶错席那”的整理者之一苗族鲁格夫尔·扎猛。此外还有各地从事文化工作的干部和各族的知识分子。云南是一个多民族的地区，各民族民间文学极为丰富。有一个名叫吴凤兰的十三岁的小姑娘，她能背一千首民歌，而且还编了许多歌唱新生活的新词。撒尼族民间故事诗“阿诗玛”整理出来以后，引起了国内外读者的重视，据初步了解，云南省几乎是每一个民族都有他们自己的“阿诗玛”，问题就在怎样把它发掘出来。这次会议的目的也就是为了总结几年来云南省民族文学的工作，进一步摸清各民族民间文学的底细，以拟订明年的工作计划，酝酿今后十二年的规划。
