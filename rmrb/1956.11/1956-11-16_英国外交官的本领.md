International Notes

    Skills of British Diplomats
    British diplomats have a special set of skills. When the air force bombed Egyptian cities, he said it was to "stop the war." When forced to announce a ceasefire under international justice pressure, he said it was "for peace." British Foreign Secretary Lloyd has this skill. At the very beginning of the invasion of Egypt, he announced menacingly in the British House of Commons: "Bombing is in progress." Ten days later, Lloyd went to New York to attend the 11th United Nations General Assembly. Before his departure, he gave a statement to reporters, suddenly becoming like a peace dove. Lloyd said: "We have differences of opinion with many UN member states," but he believed that the results would show that Britain's aggression was "a contribution to world peace" and "ultimately beneficial to the idea of establishing the rule of world law."
    It's really a case of "it never rains but it pours." Just as Lloyd was talking about the rule of world law, the representative of the Ceylon delegation in New York, A.B. Perera, gave Lloyd a head-on blow. He believed that the British and French invasion without regard to international organizations "is completely wrong"; "legally speaking, neither France nor Britain can stand their ground."
    Lloyd will know what the meaning of the rule of world law is after listening to the speeches of Asian and African countries at the United Nations General Assembly.

### 英国外交官的本领

    英国外交官的本领
    英国外交官有一套特殊的本领。空军轰炸埃及城市，他说，这是为了“制止战争”。在国际正义压力下被迫宣布停火，他说这是“为了和平”。英国外交大臣劳埃德就有这套本领。他在侵略埃及战争刚开始的时候，曾经杀气腾腾地在英国下院宣布：“轰炸正在进行中”。十天以后，劳埃德去纽约参加十一届联合国大会，行前向记者发表谈话，忽然变得像和平鸽一样了。劳埃德说：“我们同许多联合国会员国发生了意见分歧”，但是他相信结果将说明，英国的侵略是“对世界和平有贡献的”，“终归将对建立世界法治的观点有益”。
    真是所谓“无巧不成书”，就在劳埃德大谈世界法治的同时，在纽约的锡兰代表团的代表阿·布·贝雷腊给了劳埃德当头一棒。他认为英、法不理会国际组织而发动侵略“是完全错误的”；“从法律上说，无论法国或者英国都是站不住脚的”。
    劳埃德到了联合国大会上听听亚非国家的发言就会知道，世界法治的意义究竟是什么。
