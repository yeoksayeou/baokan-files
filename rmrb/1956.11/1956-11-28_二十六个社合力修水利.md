    Twenty-Six Cooperatives Join Forces to Build Water Conservancy
    Twenty-six agricultural cooperatives along the Dan River in Gaoping County, Shanxi Province, joined forces to construct the Dan River irrigation project. This year, more than 22,700 mu of long-term drought-stricken land were irrigated, resulting in an increase of more than 1,814,000 jin of grain.
    The Dan River originates in the high mountains and ridges in the northern part of Gaoping County, and is more than 70 li long, running through the entire county. In the past, the fertile land along the river was often affected by drought due to lack of rain, or threatened by floods due to mountain torrents. After the realization of agricultural cooperativization throughout the county last winter, these agricultural cooperatives along the river united and, with the help of technical cadres from the government's water conservancy department, constructed this irrigation project. The project was completed in early June. During the rainy season in July and August, although the rainfall exceeded more than double that of previous years, the tamed floods were slowly introduced into the farmland, continuously irrigating crops such as millet and corn along the river.

    二十六个社合力修水利
    山西省高平县丹河沿岸二十六个农业社合力兴修丹河灌溉工程，今年有两万两千七百多亩长期干旱的土地受到灌溉，共增产了一百八十一万四千多斤粮食。
    丹河发源在高平县北境的高山峻岭之间，全长七十多里，纵贯全县。过去沿河两岸肥沃的土地常常因为缺雨而遭受旱灾，或是因为山洪暴发而遭受洪水威胁。去年冬季全县实现农业合作化以后，沿岸这些农业社便联合起来，在政府水利部门技术干部的帮助下，兴修这个灌溉工程。6月初，工程完成。到了7、8月雨季，虽然降雨量超过往年一倍以上，但是驯服的洪水被缓缓地引入耕地，使沿岸的谷子、玉米等作物连续受到灌溉。
