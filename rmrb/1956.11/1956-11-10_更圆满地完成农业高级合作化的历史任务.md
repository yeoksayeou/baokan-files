More Thoroughly Complete the Historical Task of Advanced Agricultural Cooperativization
*People's Daily* Commentator

The advanced agricultural cooperativization movement is developing smoothly in many provinces and regions, and the overall situation is healthy. This does not mean that there are no problems in this movement.

After the high tide of cooperativization last winter and this spring, some comrades regarded leading the current movement as a very simple and easy matter. They believed: "During the high tide of cooperativization at the beginning of this year, so many advanced cooperatives were established without much effort. The current movement is just a tail end, and there is no need to worry about it anymore." "Now, to carry out advanced cooperativization, just open your mouth and wave your hand, and the masses will come. There is no need to make a big fuss."…

Such thinking dominated such actions: without carrying out ideological mobilization, without thoroughly publicizing policies, they started to merge primary cooperatives and establish advanced cooperatives. For example, in Macheng County, Hubei Province, when the Jinping No. 1 Cooperative merged with four nearby cooperatives, the local leading cadres did not consult with the masses, but convened a meeting of cadres above the level of production team leader of each cooperative, announced it, and considered it a "merger." Some places pursued excessively high targets for advancement, proposing to achieve 100% advanced cooperativization; what followed was the phenomenon of coercion and commandism. In Shaoxing County, Zhejiang Province, some cadres demanded 100% advanced cooperativization. Some individual farmers who were unwilling to join the cooperative were forced to join by swapping land. Some cadres said: "Collect the land certificates, hold a meeting, set off firecrackers, and don't be afraid that the individual households won't come in." In order to complete the task of full advancement, Taoli Township specially opened a "training class for individual farmers," concentrating the individual farmers who were unwilling to join the cooperative for "training," not allowing them to go home for meals or sleep, and only allowing them to go home after handing over their land certificates and agreeing to join the cooperative. Although these are relatively prominent examples, similar phenomena are not isolated. It is not difficult to imagine what harm such simple, hasty, coercive, and commanding practices would bring.

The current advanced cooperativization movement is a continuation of the high tide of cooperativization last winter and this spring. With the foundation of primary cooperativization, the experience of universally establishing advanced cooperatives over the past year, and the general demand of the masses to participate in advanced cooperatives, this is indeed the basic situation in the current rural areas, and an extremely favorable condition for promoting the advanced cooperativization movement. However, we must not conclude that there will be no more difficulties in merging and upgrading cooperatives. Some of the relatively wealthy farmers in primary cooperatives, who own more means of production, still have many concerns about running advanced cooperatives. Poor and lower-middle peasant members are the most active in joining advanced cooperatives, but some of them have large families or weak labor forces, and have practical difficulties in their lives, and are also afraid of reducing their income by joining advanced cooperatives. Some people who originally had more sideline income or had certain skills are also afraid that they will not be able to operate their original sidelines or engage in their original skilled labor after joining advanced cooperatives, and thus have this concern. In short, people with different economic conditions have different ideas. Those with many cattle are afraid that the cattle will become public, those with few cattle are afraid of incurring debt, those without cattle are afraid of not being able to afford the public ownership share fund, those with many trees are afraid of losing out when the trees enter the cooperative, and so on. Eliminating these ideological concerns is not something that can be done with a single call.

This year, many regions have made mistakes of subjectivism and one-sidedness in leading agricultural production; or they have made excessive and hasty demands in technical promotion, without paying attention to adapting to local conditions; or they have only paid attention to grain and cotton production, neglecting diversified operations, so that some cooperatives have not significantly increased production, and a few have even reduced production; many cooperatives have overemphasized centralized unification in management, and restricted members too rigidly; some cooperatives have not priced the socialization of means of production fairly and reasonably when they were established, causing dissatisfaction among some members. All these problems were originally caused by a lack of experience and had no necessary relationship with the socialist agricultural economic system itself. However, these shortcomings in the work tend to mislead some farmers, mistakenly believing that the superiority of advanced cooperatives is not great, and that participation in advanced cooperatives is not free. This is also a real situation that should be noted.

The specific problems in merging or expanding primary cooperatives are also very complicated. Cooperatives with better production conditions are unwilling to merge with cooperatives with poorer production conditions, cooperatives with more public accumulation are unwilling to merge with those with less, and how to properly settle the surplus cadres after the merger are not problems that can be solved without effort.

These situations all show that establishing advanced cooperatives is not a simple and easy task. If we do not recognize these problems that exist in reality, and do not use the greatest patience to eliminate the various ideological concerns of the masses, allowing those who have concerns to follow the trend or be forced to participate in advanced cooperatives, this will create many difficulties for future cooperative management work. Treating a complex matter as too simple and taking simple and hasty measures can only bring harm to the movement.

Another issue that deserves attention in the advanced cooperativization movement is that some places require "everything to be public" for the means of production or undervalue them. Some cadres believe that since they are going to be fully socialist, they should only handle collective affairs and not talk about personal affairs. When merging and upgrading cooperatives, in addition to putting the main means of production into the cooperative, they also require the members' scattered trees, small fish ponds, and scattered sidelines to be incorporated into the cooperative. In Jingmen County, Hubei Province, some places even included the chickens and ducks raised by the members themselves into the cooperative, and also announced that "small-scale production" was not allowed. The Heping Agricultural Cooperative in this county even took the members' own vegetable plots into the cooperative and did not allocate land to the members to grow vegetables. In some areas of Guangdong Province, some township cadres arbitrarily misinterpreted the model charter of advanced agricultural cooperatives in order to collect the members' scattered means of production and sidelines, proposing that "more than three trees count as a forest," "a fish pond with an area of one or two points counts as a large fish pond," and that valuable trees should be converted into ordinary trees according to their value (one tree counts as several or dozens of trees) and considered "a large number of trees." These erroneous practices increased the masses' concerns about participating in advanced cooperatives and caused destructive consequences for production.

Whether the issue of means of production entering the cooperative is handled reasonably has always been the issue of greatest concern to the masses, and whether the relationship between the collective and individuals within the cooperative is handled well depends to a large extent on whether the means of production are handled reasonably when the cooperative is established. For a considerable period after advanced cooperativization, the economic status of members will still be different; at the same time, the contradiction between individuals and the collective becomes the main contradiction within the cooperative. Therefore, it is still necessary to adhere to the policy of mutual benefit among members and to take into account both collective and individual interests. Any practice that violates the policy of mutual benefit and attempts to infringe upon the legitimate interests of individual members is wrong. In the past year, some agricultural cooperatives had problems because the means of production were undervalued, and things that should not have been concentrated in the cooperative were concentrated there, causing some members to have opinions about the cooperative, some members to have difficulties in their lives, and affecting the unity within the cooperative and the production enthusiasm of some members. This is a lesson that should be learned.

Another problem that exists in the movement is that there are still a few cadres who blindly pursue large cooperative sizes. Some county and district cadres emphasize the convenience of leadership that large cooperatives provide, believing that larger cooperatives with fewer numbers are easier to "grasp"; a few cooperative cadres believe that running large cooperatives gives them "greater prestige" and can avoid future mergers. When Jian'guo Cooperative in Macheng County, Hubei Province, heard that it was going to implement merger and upgrade, it quickly proposed to expand the cooperative to 1,300 households. Gong An, the director of the cooperative, said, "If the cooperative expands to 10,000 households, I can be equal to the 'Marquis of Ten Thousand Households' of the past." In the Eshan Yi Autonomous Region of Yunnan Province, Gexue and Takechong townships are multi-ethnic areas with forty-one natural villages of different sizes, 1,193 households, and a diameter of more than forty miles; the cadres of the two townships demanded to merge into one advanced cooperative. Some cooperative cadres were actually unwilling to run the cooperative too large, but they were afraid that others would say they had "conservative ideas," so they also clamored to run large cooperatives, saying "the bigger the cooperative, the better." According to an investigation by the Haiyang County Committee in Shandong Province, there was such a situation locally. Some leading comrades at higher levels did not understand this situation, and thought that the masses had a demand for running large cooperatives, so they also made unrealistic plans. According to the current actual situation, the size of the cooperative should not be too large. This has been specifically stipulated in the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council on strengthening the production leadership and organizational construction of agricultural production cooperatives. Many facts prove that the opinions on the size of cooperatives put forward in the instructions are correct. According to an investigation by the Haiyang County Committee of Shandong Province, the production performance of the joint-village cooperatives this year is generally not as good as that of the one-village-one-cooperative, and there are more problems within the cooperatives, the cooperative cadres feel a heavier burden, and the ideological emotions of the cooperative members are not very normal. For example, Zhao Jiaxiang, a large mountainous area, combined six villages with 593 households in the entire township into one cooperative, and the average yield of wheat per mu this summer was 97 jin; Zhangjiazhuang Village Cooperative in Xujiaxiang Township is a one-village-one-cooperative with 111 households, and the land conditions are not as good as those of Zhao Jiaxiang, but the average yield per mu was 110 jin. Similar situations have also been found in southern Shanxi Province. Although some very large cooperatives including several villages or even several townships have also achieved significant increases in production, many difficult problems have arisen in the distribution because some villages have better production conditions and some have poorer production conditions. Whether the size of the cooperative is appropriate is closely related to future production leadership and the consolidation of the cooperative. A comprehensive consideration should be made based on these specific conditions: "conducive to production, conducive to unity, suitable for the current level of management, and easy to contact cooperative members," based on the experience of running cooperatives over the past year. If we only see the favorable side and ignore the unfavorable side, blindly run large cooperatives or should expand but do not expand, it will cause losses.

According to the plans of various provinces and regions and the progress of the movement, the advanced cooperativization movement in most regions will be basically completed before the end of this year, and a few regions can also end it before the spring plowing next year. This means that through this movement this winter and next spring, the socialist transformation of agriculture can be basically completed in the rural areas of the whole country. This is a great cause, this is a solemn task, this is a critical moment. We must never relax when the great achievement is about to be completed, and we must never put stains on the huge and beautiful painting that is about to be completed at the end. With the experience of running advanced cooperatives over the past year, we must not do the work worse than in the past, but we should do the work more thoroughly and perfectly, so that each advanced cooperative has a very high quality, and so that each member lives happily and without any worries under the vigorous socialist system.

    更圆满地完成农业高级合作化的历史任务
    本报评论员
    农业的高级合作化运动正在许多省区顺利地发展着，全局是健康的。这并不是说，在这个运动中已经没有什么问题了。
    经过了去冬今春的合作化高潮以后，有些同志把领导当前的运动看成了一桩十分简单十分容易的事情。他们认为：“在今年年初合作化高潮时期，没费多大劲就建立了这么多高级社，现在的运动只是一个尾巴，更用不着操心了。”“现在搞高级合作化，只要口一张、手一招，群众就来了，用不着再兴师动众。”……
    这样的思想支配了这样的行动：不进行思想发动，不深入宣传政策，就着手合并初级社、建立高级社。如湖北省麻城县平静一社同附近的四个社合并，当地领导干部不同群众商量，召集各社生产队长以上的干部开了个会，宣布一下，就算“合并”了。有些地方对高级化追求过高的指标，提出要实现百分之百的高级化；跟着来的就是强迫命令现象。浙江省绍兴县有些干部要求百分之百的高级化，有些个体农民不愿入社，就用调换土地的办法强迫他们入社。有的干部说：“土地证收回来，大会开起来，炮竹响起来，不怕单干户不进来。”陶里乡为了完成全部高级化的任务，特别开了个“单干农民训练班”，把不愿入社的单干农民集中起来“训练”，不准回家吃饭、睡觉，要交出土地证答应入社才能回家。这些虽然是比较突出的例子，但类似的现象并不是个别的。不难设想，这种简单草率、强迫命令的作法会带来些什么危害。
    当前的高级合作化运动，是去冬今春合作化高潮的继续。有了初级合作化的基础，有了一年来普遍举办高级社的经验，参加高级社又是群众的普遍要求，这的确是当前农村的基本情况，也就是推进高级合作化运动的极其有利的条件。但是，决不能就此认为并社升级工作不会再有什么困难了。初级社里的一部分比较富裕的、占有生产资料较多的农民，对于办高级社还有不少顾虑。贫农、下中农社员对入高级社是最积极的，但他们当中有一部分家累大或者劳力弱的，生活上有实际困难，也怕加入高级社会减少收入。一些原来副业收入较多、或者有某种手艺的人，也怕入了高级社不能经营原来的副业或不能从事原来的手艺劳动而有此顾虑。总之，各种有不同经济条件的人有各种不相同的想法。耕牛多的怕耕牛归公，耕牛少的怕负债，没有耕牛的怕负担不起公有化股份基金，树木多的怕树木入社吃亏，等等。消除这种种思想顾虑，并不是一声号召就可以办到的事。
    今年许多地区在农业生产领导方面曾经犯了主观主义和片面性的毛病；或是在技术推广方面要求过高过急，不注意因地制宜；或是只重视粮棉生产，忽视了多种经营，使一些社增产不显著，少数社甚至减产；有许多合作社在经营管理上过分强调集中统一，对社员限制太死；有些社在建社的时候生产资料公有化作价不够公平合理，引起部分社员不满。所有这些问题，本来是由于缺乏经验所产生的，同社会主义的农业经济制度本身并没有必然的关系。但是，这些工作中的缺点，往往容易使一部分农民发生错觉，误认为高级社优越性不大，参加高级社不自由，这也是应该注意到的现实情况。
    初级社合并或扩大当中的具体问题，也是很复杂的。生产条件较好的社不愿和生产条件较差的社合并，公共积累较多的社不愿和较少的社合并，并社以后多余的干部如何妥善安置，等等，都不是不费气力就可以解决的问题。
    这些情况都说明了，建立高级社并不是一件简单容易的事情。如果不认识现实中存在的这些问题，不用最大的耐心消除群众的各种思想顾虑，任随那些有顾虑的人随潮流或者被迫参加了高级社，这就会给今后的办社工作造成许多困难。把本来很复杂的事情看得太简单而采取简单急躁的作法，只能给运动带来损害。
    在高级合作化运动中，另一个值得注意的问题，是有些地方对生产资料要求“一切归公”或者作价偏低。有些干部认为既然要完全社会主义化了，就应当只办集体的事，不谈个人的事。在并社升级的时候，除了把主要生产资料入社以外，还要求把社员的零星树木、小块鱼塘、零星副业都归并到社里。湖北省荆门县有的地方把社员自喂的鸡、鸭都入了社，还宣布不准搞“小生产”。这个县的和平农业社甚至把社员的自用菜地也收归社有，不另分地给社员种菜。广东省个别地区的一些乡干部为了把社员零星的生产资料和副业都收到社里来，任意曲解高级农业社示范章程，提出“三株以上的树木就算成林”，“一分两分面积的鱼塘就算大片鱼塘”，值钱的树按价值折成一般的树（一株算几株或几十株）就算“大量树木”。这些错误的作法增加了群众参加高级社的顾虑，并且造成破坏生产的后果。
    生产资料入社问题处理得是否合理，始终是群众最关心的问题，社内集体和个人的关系处理得好不好，在很大程度上也取决于建社的时候生产资料处理得合理不合理。高级合作化以后一个相当时期，社员的经济地位仍然是有差别的；同时，个人与集体的矛盾成了社内主要的矛盾。因此，仍然必须坚持社员之间互利的政策，并且兼顾集体利益和个人利益。任何违反互利政策和企图侵犯社员个人的正当利益的做法都是错误的。过去一年来，一些农业合作社就是因为对生产资料作价偏低，不应集中在社里的也集中到社里，使有些社员对社有意见，有些社员在生活上发生困难，影响了社内的团结和某些社员的生产积极性。这是应该接受的教训。
    运动当中存在的另一个问题是仍然有少数干部对社的规模盲目贪大。有些县、区干部比较强调社大了领导方便的一面，认为社大些数目少些“好抓”一些；有少数社干部认为办大社“威望大”，而且可以免得将来再合并。湖北麻城县的建国社听说要实行并社升级，很快就提出了要把社扩大到一千三百户的规划。社主任龚安说：“社扩大到一万户，我就可以抵上过去的万户侯了。”云南省峨山彝族自治区的各雪、塔克冲两个乡，是多民族地区，大小四十一个自然村，一千一百九十三户，直径四十多里；两乡干部却要求合并成一个高级社。有些社干部实际上不愿把社办得太大，但是害怕别人说自己有“保守思想”，也嚷着要办大社，说“社越大越好”。据山东省海阳县委调查，当地就有这种情况。有些上级领导同志不了解这种情况，以为群众有办大社的要求，也订了不切合实际的规划。按照当前的实际情况，社的规模是不宜过大的。这在中共中央和国务院关于加强农业生产合作社的生产领导和组织建设的指示中已经作了具体的规定。许多事实证明，指示中提出的关于社的规模的意见是正确的。据山东省海阳县委的调查，当地的联村社今年的生产成绩一般不如一村一社的好，而且社内问题较多，社干部感到包袱较重，社员群众的思想情绪也不大正常。如当地大山区赵家乡全乡六个村五百九十三户办一个社，今年夏季每亩小麦产量平均九十七斤；徐家乡的张家庄村社是一村一社，一百一十一户，土地条件不如赵家乡，每亩产量却平均有一百一十斤。山西晋南地区也发现了类似的情况。有些规模很大包括几村甚至几乡的社，虽然增产也很显著，但因为有的村生产条件较好、有的村生产条件较差，在分配的时候发生了不少难以解决的问题。社的规模大小是否适当，同今后的生产领导和社的巩固有很大关系。应该根据一年来办社的经验，从“有利生产，有利团结，适合当前的管理水平，便于联系社员”这些具体条件出发，作全面的考虑。如果只看到有利的一面，忽视了不利的一面，盲目办大社或应该扩大也不扩大，就会造成损失。
    根据各个省、区的规划和运动进展情况看来，多数地区的高级合作化运动，都将在今年年底以前基本完成，少数地区在明年春耕以前也可以结束。这就是说，经过今冬明春的这一次运动，全国农村就可以基本完成农业的社会主义改造。这是一个伟大的事业，这是一个庄严的任务，这是一个紧要的时刻。决不应该在大功将要告成的时候松气，决不应该在将要画成的巨大的美丽的画幅上在最后涂上污点。有了一年来办高级社的经验，决不应当把工作做得不如过去，而应当把工作做得更周到更完满，使每个高级社都有很高的质量，使每个社员都毫无顾虑地、欢欢喜喜地在生气勃勃的社会主义制度下生活。
