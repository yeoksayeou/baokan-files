    Before Victory
    —A Record of Attending the Enlarged Meeting of the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party
    By Our Correspondents Wang Qi and Xiao Yan
    The Yellow River, this untamed river, brings the threat of disaster to the people of Shandong Province every year. This year, the Weiyun River also breached its banks, causing the largest flood in Shandong Province since 1952. Under these circumstances, Shandong Province still had a bumper harvest this year. The original plan was to increase grain production by 30 billion jin and cotton by 5 million dan this year; as of the end of October, according to preliminary statistics from various places: grain reached 31.3 billion jin (including sweet potatoes and soybeans), and cotton reached 5.42 million dan. If it were not for the disaster that reduced grain production by about 1 billion jin, the increase would have been even greater. Shandong Province also had a bumper harvest last year; the flood was more severe this year, but grain production still increased by 16.5% compared to last year.
    The First Year of Basic Cooperativization
    This is the result of agricultural cooperativization. 95% of the province's farmers have embarked on the road of cooperativization, of which 75% of farmers have joined advanced agricultural cooperatives. The Shandong Party organization grasped the enthusiasm of the masses to take the road of cooperativization and promptly organized this enthusiasm into productive action. Last winter, a vigorous production campaign was launched throughout the province, creating good conditions for this year's increase in production. Party organizations at all levels actively led agricultural production, focusing on water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation as two key points. Last winter, Shandong Province's water conservancy construction focused on well-digging and the construction of ponds and reservoirs. After practical testing, 70% of the wells were good and played a role in increasing production. The province-wide pig raising and fertilizer accumulation also achieved certain results. The number of pigs increased by about one million this year. Shou Zhang County has averaged more than one pig per household; therefore, this county has applied one more cart of fertilizer per mu on average. Significant progress has also been made in promoting improved varieties and improving cultivation techniques. This year, the "Victory No. 100" improved variety of sweet potato, called "digua" in Shandong, was promoted and achieved unprecedented harvests, with a province-wide increase of 7.9 billion jin. Wheat, cotton, soybeans, and peanuts also increased production compared to previous years. 80% of the province's agricultural cooperatives achieved increased production, and about 80% of cooperative members increased their income, with some cooperatives achieving increased income for more than 90% of their members. This ironclad fact has deeply educated the farmers and strengthened their confidence in taking the socialist road. Many farmers have put forward slogans: to be "single-minded" and resolutely carry on!
    Correctly Accept Lessons and Experience
    The Shandong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held an enlarged meeting from October 25th to 30th. Comrade Li Wen, Secretary of the Laiyang Local Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, raised a new question in his speech at the meeting: According to preliminary estimates, Laiyang area increased production by about 25% this year; since liberation, the highest output was in 1952, and this year's production increased by 1 billion jin compared to 1952. However, the production enthusiasm of some cadres and the masses is not as high as last winter. Other regions have similar situations. Where is the problem?
    Although last winter's production campaign played a huge role in ensuring this year's bumper harvest, some of the production measures were not entirely appropriate. Last winter's provincial conference of agricultural activists put forward the call for a comprehensive "thousand jin of grain, hundred jin of cotton, ten thousand jin of sweet potatoes" production competition. The requirements for the realization of the twelve-year plan were too high and too urgent, resulting in excessive consumption of manpower and materials, causing the cooperative's funds to be tight, and affecting the income of the members. After discovering these shortcomings, party organizations at all levels promptly criticized this blind emotion from top to bottom, enabling this year's production campaign to develop normally. However, some cadres still cannot correctly accept lessons and experience. One of the main reasons why the current production guidance is not as energetic as last year is here. On the other hand, due to the influence of blind enthusiasm last winter, the production plans of cooperatives were generally too high. The value of labor days determined on the basis of such plans was also too high. For a time, it was widely rumored that a labor day could earn two or three yuan. However, when the autumn harvest came, the actual results were not as great as imagined, and there were even about 20% of cooperatives and households with the same or reduced production. In addition, the leading cadres did not promptly announce the distribution plan to the members, which caused some negative emotions among the masses. Furthermore, the cooperatives had not yet been rectified after their large-scale development, and there were still some internal problems, which also affected the enthusiasm of the masses.
    The meeting analyzed these reasons, pointing out that it is necessary to summarize past experiences and lessons in a realistic way, distinguish between right and wrong, raise understanding, and further improve rural work this winter.
    Shandong Province's production plan this year is, in general, realistic. However, due to the increase at each level, it became too high at the lower level. Last winter's provincial conference of agricultural activists vaguely put forward the call to universally launch the "thousand, hundred, ten thousand jin (thousand jin of grain, hundred jin of cotton, or ten thousand jin of sweet potatoes per mu per year) production competition", requiring the creation of 20 million mu of high-yield fields, which had a great deal of blind adventurism. Some cooperatives that did not meet the conditions for competition were also busy creating high-yield fields; as a result, what was said could not be done, causing frustration and unease among cadres and the masses, and dampened their enthusiasm. However, it should also be noted that the provincial party committee later changed the "thousand, hundred, ten thousand jin increase in production" to a competition indicator for key townships and cooperatives, which is still achievable. In fact, some agricultural cooperatives in the Tai'an area originally had a production target of more than 200 jin of wheat per mu; now they produce more than 300 jin to more than 500 jin of wheat per mu. The average wheat yield in Huangxian County reached 400 jin, which also exceeded the original target. A thousand jin of grain per mu in summer and autumn can be achieved in some cooperatives. Blind enthusiasm that does not proceed from reality should, of course, be criticized and opposed; however, an increase in production plan based on reality is still necessary. It is also incorrect if one does not dare or is unwilling to propose an active and reliable plan because he/she criticized the blind plan.
    Attempting to realize the twelve-year plan in two or three years is obviously a manifestation of subjectivism and should be criticized. As some cooperative members said: "Don't do such 'ghost talk' (a homophone for 'planning')!" However, the question is not whether or not to engage in planning, but what kind of planning is needed. Is it to engage in planning based on needs and possibilities, proceeding from reality? Or is it to engage in planning based on subjective thoughts?
    This year's investment in farmland infrastructure construction was too large. In some places, it was impossible to dig so many wells according to the labor and capital conditions, but the wells were still dug according to the plan. In some places, it was not appropriate to dig wells, and it was necessary to build ponds and reservoirs, but wells were also dug; in some places, the only concern was the number of wells, and the quality was not high, and there were even waste products. Therefore, some cadres are now less enthusiastic about water conservancy construction. What is the actual situation? 70% of the wells dug last winter are still good, and the province's irrigated land has increased from 8 million mu in the past to 37 million mu, which has played a great role in increasing production. The province currently has 2.66 million water wells and 500,000 waterwheels, plus ponds and some large-scale projects. By next winter, it may be possible to strive for an average of one mu of irrigated land per person in the province. If these water conservancy constructions can be brought into full play and developed appropriately according to needs and possibilities, they will become a huge guarantee for increasing production. After analyzing these situations, the meeting pointed out two aspects of actively leading water conservancy construction work in the future: one is to repair existing wells and ponds and give full play to their role; the other is to continue to actively develop them according to needs and possibilities.
    Facts tell us: to learn from lessons, we must proceed from reality, be realistic, and oppose what needs to be opposed and maintain what should be maintained. It is not conducive to work to oppose the correct and the incorrect together. Similarly, such an attitude should also be adopted when accepting experience. Cadres in Shandong Province have had many profound experiences in the past: in the past, due to the neglect of water conservancy work, when encountering drought, they dug wells when they were thirsty, with little effect. Since last winter, they have attached importance to water conservancy construction, but some places have not paid enough attention to fertilizer accumulation, so that some corn was densely planted with double plants, but because the fertilizer could not keep up, it only grew stalks and not cobs, which the masses called "bachelors". Last winter, they focused on farmland infrastructure construction and relaxed the leadership of sideline production, so that more than 90% of the members could not increase their income. Currently, facing the important juncture of winter production, there is a tendency to pay insufficient attention to agricultural production. This is worthy of vigilance.
    Comrade Shu Tong, First Secretary of the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, emphasized in his conclusion: Reviewing the past experience of accepting lessons and experiences is of extremely great significance for how to correctly accept lessons and experiences in the future, for improving the party's leadership over rural work, for ensuring the continued development of agricultural production in the future, and for overcoming blindness and one-sidedness.
    Lay the Foundation for Greater Victory
    After summarizing the past experiences and lessons, the Shandong Provincial Committee enlarged meeting also analyzed the current situation of agricultural cooperatives.
    20% of the same-production and reduced-production cooperatives generally have 30% to 50% of the households with the same or reduced income. Among the increased-production cooperatives, there are also 5% to 20% of households with the same or reduced income. They generally reflect that grain is tight, grass is tight, and money is tight; some members have produced restless emotions. Some doubt the superiority of socialism and even demand to withdraw from the cooperatives.
    Some places adopt a discriminatory and打击 attitude towards individual farmers, causing them to be angry. In Tai'an County, individual cooperatives do not allow individual farmers to pass through the fields of the cooperatives. Of all the problems, the most prominent is the issue of promoting democracy. Many facts prove that where democratic management of the cooperatives is implemented, there are fewer problems; even the members whose income is reduced have not lost confidence in the socialist future. These members all hold the belief of "looking at tomorrow, not today". Where democratic management of the cooperatives is not implemented, the situation is different: the enthusiasm of the masses is not high, production is not done well, and the subjective style of the cadres cannot be resisted.
    The overall cooperation in rural areas has brought about economic concentration, and millions of farmers have handed over their economic lifeline to the cooperatives. Therefore, farmers have a universal and strong demand for democratic management of the cooperatives. Under the new situation of highly centralized unity, some cadres tend to be arbitrary and replace the mass line with coercion and command. After analyzing these actual situations, this meeting absorbed the correct opinions of the prefectural committee secretaries present at the meeting and determined that production and rectification of the cooperatives would be the central task of winter work; implementing the policy of democratic management of the cooperatives, promoting democracy within the cooperatives, and implementing the policy of diligence and frugality in managing the cooperatives, and increasing the income of the members, were taken as the basic links in rectifying the agricultural cooperatives. It is necessary to solve the economic problems that the members of the community urgently need to solve on the basis of democratic management of the community. For some sideline productions, cooperatives should not be too strict in grasping them and restrict them too much. As long as it is suitable for farmers' families to do, we should try to help farmers to do it in order to give play to the enthusiasm of farmers in production and appropriately meet the daily needs of farmers. It is necessary to emphasize that the rectification of the cooperatives is not to "rectify" the cadres of the cooperatives, but to adopt the method of summarizing the experience and lessons of production and management of the cooperatives, and to commend good cadres and good styles in order to achieve the purpose of uniting, educating and improving the level of cadres.
    The meeting pointed out that this winter's work of rectifying the cooperatives is not only the key to doing a good job in this winter's production work, but also laying the foundation for next year's production and for the consolidation and development of the cooperatives in the future.
    This meeting fully studied the new situations and problems that were different from this year and previous years, repeatedly discussed with the lower levels, and arranged the work on a practical and reliable basis. It also held an active and proactive attitude towards long-term work plans. At this meeting, three targets were proposed for increasing grain production next year: one is to increase production by 5%; the second is to increase production by 7%; and the third is to increase production by 10%; cotton production is to increase by 40 to 50 jin per mu. The meeting did not affirm these indicators, but asked everyone to go down to investigate and study further, follow the mass line, and make a decision after a while. In this way, it will not be taking one step and looking at the next, falling behind the actual and the masses; nor will it be subjectively blind and exceed the actual possibilities.

    在胜利面前
    ——中共山东省委扩大会议旁听记
    本报记者　汪琦　肖彦
    黄河，这条不驯服的河流，年年给山东省人民带来灾害的威胁。今年，卫运河又决了口，造成了山东省从1952年以来最大的水灾。在这情况下，山东省今年的农业仍然是丰收年景。原来计划今年增产粮食三百亿斤，棉花五百万担；到10月底止，根据各地估算预报初步统计：粮食达到了三百一十三亿斤（包括甘薯和大豆）、棉花五百四十二万担。如果不是因为受灾而减少了大约十亿斤粮食，增产的成绩还要更大。去年山东省也是丰收的；今年水灾比去年严重，还是比去年增产了16.5％的粮食。
    基本合作化的第一年
    这是农业合作化的成果。全省95％的农民都走上了合作化的道路，其中有75％的农民参加了高级农业社。山东党组织掌握了群众走合作化道路的积极性，及时地把这种积极性组织到生产行动中去。去年冬季，普遍掀起了轰轰烈烈的生产运动，为今年的增产创造了良好的条件。各级党组织积极领导农业生产，突出地抓住了水利建设和积肥两个关键。去冬山东省水利建设，着重打井和兴建塘坝水库。经过实际考验，70％的井都是好的，在增产上发挥了作用。全省规模的养猪积肥也有一定的成绩。今年增加了大约一百万头猪。寿张县平均已超过每户一头猪；因此，这个县平均每亩地多上了一车肥料。在推广良种、提高耕作技术方面，成绩也比较显著。今年推广“胜利百号”良种甘薯，在山东叫“地瓜”，得到了空
  前未有的丰收，全省增产达七十九亿斤。小麦、棉花、大豆、花生也都比往年增产。全省80％的农业社得到了增产，80％左右的社员增加了收入，一部分合作社做到90％以上的社员增加收入。这个铁的事实，深深地教育了农民，坚定了他们走社会主义道路的信心。许多农民提出口号：要“一心无二”，坚决地干下去！
    正确地接受经验教训
    中共山东省委在10月25日到30日召开了扩大会议。中共莱阳地方委员会书记李文同志在这次会上的发言中，提出了一个新问题：据初步估算，莱阳地区今年增产约25％左右；解放以来，以1952年产量最高，今年比1952年增产了十亿斤粮食。但是，有些干部和群众的生产劲头，反而不如去年冬季。其他地区也有类似情况。问题在哪里呢？
    去年冬季的增产运动，虽然对于保证今年的丰收起了巨大的作用，但是，有些增产措施并不是完全妥当的。去冬全省农业积极分子大会上提出了全面开展千斤粮百斤棉万斤甘薯的增产竞赛号召，对十二年规划的实现，要求偏高偏急，以致过多地耗用了人力物力，造成合作社的资金紧张，影响到社员的收入。各级党组织在发现这些缺点以后，自上而下地及时批判了这种盲目情绪，使今年的生产运动得以正常地发展。可是有些干部还不能正确地接受经验教训。当前生产的指导上劲头不如去年，主要原因之一就在这里。另一方面，由于去冬受盲
  目积极性的影响，合作社的生产计划一般偏高。在这样计划基础上定出的劳动日价值也偏高，一度普遍嚷嚷一个劳动日可得二元、三元。可是，到了秋收的时候，实际成果并不如想像那样大，甚至还有20％左右的平产减产社和平收减收户。加以领导干部没有及时将分配方案向社员公布，在群众中就产生了某些消极情绪。再加上合作社大发展以后还没有来得及整顿，内部还存在一些问题，也影响到群众的积极性的发挥。
    会议分析了这些原因，指出要实事求是地总结过去的经验和教训，划清是非界限，提高认识，进一步做好今年冬季的农村工作。
    山东省今年的增产计划，从总的方面来看，是切合实际的。但是，由于层层加大，到了下面就偏高了。去年冬天全省农业积极分子大会上笼统地提出了普遍开展“千百万斤（每亩全年产千斤粮或百斤棉或万斤薯）增产竞赛”的号召，要求创造两千万亩丰产田，带有很大的盲目冒进情绪。有些不够竞赛条件的合作社，也忙着去创造丰产田；结果说了做不到，使干部和群众产生了苦闷和不安，挫伤了他们的积极性。不过，也要注意到，省委以后把“千百万斤增产”改为在重点乡社的竞赛指标，这还是可以做得到的。实际上泰安专区有些农业社，原来的增产指标是：每亩产小麦二百多斤；现在每亩产小麦三百多斤到五百多斤。黄县全县平均小麦产量达到四百斤，也超过了原来的指标。夏秋两季亩产千斤粮，在一些社是可以做到的。对不从实际出发的那种盲目的积极性，当然是应该批判和反对的；但是，从实际出发的增产计划，还是必要的。因为批判了盲目地订增产计划就不敢或不愿再提出积极可靠的计划，也是不正确的。
    企图把十二年的规划在两三年内实现，显然是主观主义的一种表现，是应该批判的。正如有的社员说的：“这样的‘鬼话’（和‘规划’同音），不要搞了！”不过，问题不在于要不要搞规划，而在于要什么样的规划。是根据需要和可能，从实际出发来搞规划呢？还是根据主观想怎样搞就怎样搞呢？
    今年农田基本建设投资过大，有的地方按劳力资金条件不可能打那样多的井，还是照计划打了。有的地方不应该打井，需要修塘坝水库，也打了井；有的地方打井只求数量多，结果质量不高，甚至还有废品。因此，有些干部现在对水利建设的劲头不大了。实际情况怎样呢？去冬打的井，有70％还是好的，全省水浇地由过去的八百万亩增加到三千七百万亩，对增产起了很大作用。全省现有水井二百六十六万眼，水车五十万部，加上塘坝和一些大型工程，到明年冬季，就有可能争取全省平均每人有一亩水浇地。如果能使这些水利建设充分发挥作用，并按需要和可能适当地发展，就会成为增产的巨大保证。会议分析了这些情况以后，指出了今后积极领导水利建设工作的两个方面：一是整修现有水井塘坝，充分发挥它们的作用；二是根据需要和可能，继续积极发展。
    事实告诉我们：吸取教训，必须从实际出发，实事求是地把需要反对的反对掉，把应当保持的保持下来。把正确的同不正确的一起反对掉了，对工作是不利的。同样，接受经验，也应当采取这样的态度。山东省的干部过去有不少这样深切的体验：过去，由于忽视了水利工作，遇到干旱，临渴掘井，收效不大。去冬以来，重视了水利建设，某些地方对积肥又重视不够，以致有的玉米进行了双株密植，但因肥料跟不上，光长秆儿不长棒，群众把它叫“光棍汉”。去年冬季抓紧了农田基本建设，放松了对副业生产的领导，以致不能使90％以上的社员增加收入。目前，面临冬季生产的重要关头，又出现了对农业生产不够重视的苗头。这是值得引起警惕的。
    中共山东省委第一书记舒同同志在做结论的时候，着重指出：重温过去接受经验教训的经验，对于今后怎样正确地接受经验教训，对于改进党对农村工作的领导，对于保证今后的农业生产继续发展，对于克服盲目性和片面性，有极其重大的意义。
    为更大的胜利打基础
    山东省委扩大会议在总结了过去的经验和教训以后，又对当前农业合作社的情况作了分析。
    20％的平产社和减产社，其中一般有30％到50％的减收户和平收户。在增产社中，也有5％到20％的平收户和减收户。他们普遍反映粮紧、草紧、钱紧；有些社员产生了动荡不安的情绪。对社会主义的优越性发生怀疑，甚至要求退社。
    有些地方对单干户采取歧视打击的态度，给他们气受。泰安县有个别的社，不让单干户从合作社的田里过。在所有问题中，最突出的还是发扬民主的问题。许多事实证明：哪里实行了民主办社，哪里的问题就少一些；即使减少收入的社员，也没有失去对社会主义前途的信心。这些社员都抱着“不看今天、看明天”的信念。没有实行民主办社的，情况就不同了：群众积极性不高，生产搞不好，干部的主观主义作风受不到抵制。
    农村全面合作化带来了经济的集中，千百万农民把他们的经济命脉交给了合作社。因此，农民对于民主办社，有着普遍的、强烈的要求。在高度集中统一的新情况下，有些干部办起事来，容易独断专行，以强迫命令代替群众路线。这次会议分析了这些实际情况以后，吸收了到会的地委书记的正确意见，确定以生产整社为冬季的中心工作；以贯彻民主办社方针、发扬社内民主，贯彻勤俭办社方针、增加社员收入，作为整顿农业社的基本环节。要在民主办社的基础上，解决目前社员群众迫切需要解决的经济问题。对有些副业生产，合作社不要抓得太紧，限制太死。只要适合农民家庭办的，应当设法帮助农民去搞，以便发挥农民生产的积极性，适当满足农民的日常需要。要强调指出整社不是“整”社干部，而是采取总结生产办社的经验和教训的办法，并且要表扬好的干部、好的作风，以达到团结教育和提高干部水平的目的。
    会议指出：今冬的整社工作，不仅是搞好今冬生产工作的关键，而且是为明年的生产、为今后合作社的巩固和发展打基础，是由今年的胜利走向更大胜利的起脚点。
    这次会议充分研究了今年和往年不同的新的情况和问题，同下级反复商量，把工作安排在切实而可靠的基础上。对长远的工作计划，也抱着积极主动的态度。在这次会上，对明年的粮食增产提出了三个指标：一是增产5％；二是增产7％；三是增产10％；棉花产量是每亩增产四十斤到五十斤。会议对这些指标都没有肯定，而是让大家再下去调查研究，走群众路线，过些时候再作决定。这样，就不会是走一步看一步，落在实际和群众的后面；也不会主观盲目，超过实际的可能。
