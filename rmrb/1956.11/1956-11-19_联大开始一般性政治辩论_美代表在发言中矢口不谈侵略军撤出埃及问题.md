Xinhua News Agency, November 16th, New York dispatch: The United Nations General Assembly held a plenary meeting on the morning of November 15th to discuss the agenda proposed by the General Committee.

After approving the General Committee's recommendation that the General Assembly should add a vice-president, the Assembly held an election for this vice-president. As a result of the election, Italy received the most votes, and Italian representative, Foreign Minister Martino, was elected as Vice-President of the General Assembly. The number of vice-presidents thus increased from seven to eight.

The Assembly then adopted the recommendation that the Eleventh Session of the United Nations General Assembly should adjourn from December 23rd to January 2nd of next year and close on February 15th of next year.

The Assembly also decided to include items such as the Korean issue, disarmament issue, and the Palestinian Arab refugee issue on the agenda of the Assembly.

Xinhua News Agency, November 17th dispatch: According to TASS, New York, November 17th: The United Nations General Assembly began a general political debate at its plenary meeting on the afternoon of November 16th. Representatives from Brazil, Iraq, the United States, Ecuador, Portugal, and the Dominican Republic spoke at the meeting. The Middle East issue and the so-called "Hungarian question" were the central issues they discussed.

Brazilian representative Freitas Valle called on United Nations member states to "demonstrate wisdom and patience" to "avoid" the danger of further "complicating" the already complex international situation. However, he not only failed to offer any constructive suggestions but also attempted to defend the British, French, and Israeli aggression against Egypt under the pretext of the "interests of the users of the Suez Canal." The Brazilian representative also demanded that the United Nations interfere in Hungary's internal affairs.

Iraqi representative Jamali condemned the aggression against Egypt by Britain, France, and Israel. He said that Britain and France should immediately withdraw their troops from Egypt.

Jamali advocated abolishing the unanimity rule of the permanent members of the Security Council. He also put forward some suggestions for amending certain other articles of the Charter.

US representative, Under Secretary of State Hoover Jr., spoke on behalf of Dulles. He expressed dissatisfaction with the fact that the US attempt to use the United Nations to interfere in Hungarian affairs had not yielded the expected results. He demanded that the Assembly give priority to discussing the so-called "Hungarian question" and taking urgent measures on this issue. He apparently wanted to use this method to divert the attention of the Assembly and the world public from the aggression of Israel, Britain, and France in Egypt.

When discussing the Near East situation, Hoover expressed welcome for the "preparedness to cooperate" of Britain, France, and Israel in implementing the United Nations resolutions. Hoover expressed unease about the news that volunteer forces might appear in the Near East. He said that the responsibility of all countries, including the parties to the conflict, lies in not sending any forces other than the United Nations Special Forces to the area where military operations have just taken place. However, Hoover did not mention here the US attitude towards the demand that the aggressor troops immediately withdraw from Egyptian territory.

Hoover attempted to portray the Middle East issue as if the current main task was not to strive for the implementation of the United Nations resolution on the immediate withdrawal of foreign troops from Egypt, but to "formulate plans to ensure" the "use and maintenance" of the Suez Canal "in consultation with the countries concerned."

Ecuadorian representative Trujillo insisted on amending the United Nations Charter and abolishing the principle of unanimity of the permanent members of the Security Council. He also advocated increasing the number of non-permanent members of the Security Council to eight, increasing the members of the Economic and Social Council from eighteen to twenty-four, and increasing the judges of the International Court of Justice by three, that is, to eighteen.

The representatives of Portugal and the Dominican Republic defended the aggression of Britain, France, and Israel and advocated not taking measures to implement the United Nations resolution on the withdrawal of aggressor troops.

As the meeting was about to end, the President of the Assembly said that, at the request of "certain delegations," the general debate would be temporarily suspended, and the issues raised by the Second Emergency Session of the United Nations General Assembly, namely the so-called "Hungarian situation" issue, would be discussed at the plenary meeting on November 19th.

The general debate will continue on November 20th.

    联大开始一般性政治辩论
    美代表在发言中矢口不谈侵略军撤出埃及问题
    新华社16日讯　纽约消息：联合国大会15日上午举行全体会议，讨论有关总务委员会提出的议程的问题。
    在批准总务委员会关于大会应该增加一个副主席的建议以后，大会就这个副主席的人选进行选举。选举结果，意大利获得最多票，于是意大利代表、外交部长马蒂诺当选为大会副主席。从此副主席人数从七名增加为八名。
    大会接着通过联合国大会第十一届会议从12月23日到明年1月2日休会，并且在明年2月15日闭幕的建议。
    大会还决定把朝鲜问题、裁军问题、巴勒斯坦阿拉伯难民问题等项目列入大会议程。
    新华社17日讯　据塔斯社纽约17日讯：11月16日联合国大会下午全体会议上开始了一般性政治辩论，在会议上发言的有巴西、伊拉克、美国、厄瓜多尔、葡萄牙和多米尼加共和国的代表。中东问题和所谓“匈牙利问题”是他们谈论的中心问题。
    巴西代表弗雷塔斯·瓦利呼吁联合国会员国“表现出智慧和耐性”，以“避免”已经复杂化了的国际局势“更加复杂化的危险”。可是，他不仅没有提出任何建设性的意见，反而以“苏伊士运河使用国的利益”作口实，企图替英、法和以色列对埃及的侵略辩护。巴西代表还要求联合国干涉匈牙利的内政。
    伊拉克代表贾马利谴责英、法、以三国对埃及的侵略。他说，英、法两国应该立即把自己的军队撤出埃及。
    贾马利主张废除安理会常任理事国一致规则。他还提出了一些有关修改宪章某些其他条款的建议。
    美国代表、副国务卿小胡佛代表杜勒斯发言。他对美国利用联合国干涉匈牙利事务的企图未能收到预期的结果表示不满。他要求大会优先讨论所谓“匈牙利问题”和在这个问题上采取紧急措施。他显然想用这种办法来使大会和世界公众不去注意以色列、英国和法国在埃及的侵略行为。
    小胡佛在谈到近东局势时，胡佛表示欢迎英、法、以关于他们在实现联合国决议方面“准备进行合作”。胡佛对近东可能出现志愿军的消息表示不安。他说，包括冲突各方在内的一切国家的职责在于，除了联合国特种部队外不要把任何武力派往刚刚发生过军事行动的地区。然而胡佛在这里并未谈到美国对要求侵略军立即撤出埃及领土这一点的态度。
    胡佛企图把中东的问题说成是目前的主要任务不是争取实现联合国关于外国军队立即撤出埃及的决议，而是“用同有关国家协商的方法制定保证”苏伊士运河“使用和维护的计划”。
    厄瓜多尔代表特鲁希略坚持修改联合国宪章和废除安全理事会常任理事一致的原则。他还主张把安全理事会非常任理事的数目增加到八个，把经济及社会理事会理事由十八个增至二十四个，国际法院法官增加三人，即增加到十八人。
    葡萄牙和多米尼加共和国的代表替英、法、以三国的侵略行为辩护，主张不要采取措施执行联合国关于撤退侵略军的决议。
    在会议将结束时，大会主席说，根据“某些代表团”的要求，一般性的辩论暂时停止，11月19日的全体大会上将要讨论联合国大会第二次紧急会议所提出过的问题，即所谓“匈牙利局势”问题。
    一般性的辩论将在11月20日继续进行。
