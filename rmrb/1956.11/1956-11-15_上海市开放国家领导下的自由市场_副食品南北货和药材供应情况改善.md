    Shanghai Opens Free Market Under State Leadership; Improved Supply of Non-Staple Foods, Dried and Cured Goods, and Medicinal Materials
    (Our newspaper Shanghai, 14th dispatch) In the past two months, Shanghai has opened free markets under state leadership in certain commercial sectors, implementing free purchasing, free transport and sales, which has improved the supply situation of non-staple foods, dried and cured goods, and medicinal materials, which were previously in tight supply, and the market has become more active.
    The supply of live chickens, fresh fish, dried and cured goods, and medicinal materials, which had long been in short supply in the Shanghai market, has been continuously increasing since the opening of the free market. During this period, merchants transported approximately 20,000 jin of live chickens to Shanghai every day. The Dada Wharf, the Shanghai live chicken distribution market, which had been unusually deserted for a long time, is now bustling again. The vegetable markets are filled with various kinds of fresh freshwater fish, and fishmongers and fishermen now deliver approximately 800 dan of fresh fish directly to the market every day. Housewives are beaming with joy, as they can often buy fish, shrimp, and chicken eggs without queuing. More than one million jin of red dates, shiitake mushrooms, dried shrimp, lotus seeds, and some medicinal materials, which were in short supply in the previous period, have recently been transported by merchants and farmers from the production areas.
    After the joint public-private ownership of the dried and cured goods and Chinese medicinal materials industries in Shanghai, the excessively strict restrictions imposed by the administrative management authorities once brought free purchasing to a standstill, resulting in a tight supply of many commodities. Recently, under the leadership of professional companies, unreasonable restrictions were lifted, and a large number of experienced purchasing personnel were organized to freely purchase goods from various places. Many commodities that had been out of stock for a long time regained their sources of supply. The medicinal materials industry freely purchased 475 kinds of medicinal materials from the production areas, totaling 420,000 jin. "Ginger worms," which had been in tight supply in the market for a long time, were recently purchased through small merchants and farmers in the production areas, totaling more than 3,000 jin, which is enough for the city to use for half a year. Dried and cured goods are also arriving in a steady stream. Henan Xinzheng red dates, Ningbo's yellow citrus, white peony root, and the famous Zhangjiakou mushrooms, which had been out of stock in the Shanghai market for a long time, are once again meeting with Shanghai customers. With the help of commercial departments in the production areas, these purchasing personnel not only found the urgently needed sources of goods, but also restored the original supply and marketing relationships.
    Since the opening of the free market in these commercial sectors in Shanghai, some problems have also arisen. One is the phenomenon of blind transport and sales, resulting in an unbalanced supply of goods. Recently, there has been an oversupply of live chickens and fresh fish, making it difficult for merchants and farmers to sell their goods in a short period of time. There have been instances of goods being destroyed due to spoilage. At the same time, with the opening of the free market, commercial intermediaries who had been basically eliminated in the past have become active again. A group of "scalpers" (i.e., intermediaries) have emerged in places where peddlers and peasants frequent, such as Shanghai Railway Station and the docks. They drive up the price and rush to buy agricultural and sideline products brought by farmers or peddlers, buy them at low prices, and sell them on the black market at high prices. There are also a few merchants who engage in deception and fraud, selling inferior goods as superior goods, and some who make excessive profits on goods that are in short supply. This shows that while opening up the free market, it is necessary to strengthen the leadership of the state administrative organs accordingly. The Shanghai commercial departments are studying solutions to these problems. (Xi Ping)

### 上海市开放国家领导下的自由市场  副食品南北货和药材供应情况改善

    上海市开放国家领导下的自由市场
    副食品南北货和药材供应情况改善
    本报上海14日电　上海市近二个月来在某些商业行业中开放国家领导下的自由市场，实行自由采购、自由贩运和买卖，使一向货源紧张的副食品、南北货和药材供应状况得到改善，市场更见活跃。
    上海市场上长期缺货的毛鸡、鱼鲜、南北货和药材，在自由市场开放后，货源不断增加，这一时期，商贩每天运到上海的毛鸡约二万斤，长久以来冷落异常的上海毛鸡集散市场——大达码头，现在又重新喧闹起来。菜市场上摆满了各种鲜活的淡水鱼，鱼贩和渔民们现在每天有八百担左右的鲜鱼直接送到市场上。家庭主妇们喜笑颜开，她们常常不需要排队就可以买到鱼虾和鸡子。前一时期缺货的红枣、香菇、虾米、莲子和一部分药材，最近由这些行业的商贩和产地农民运来了一百多万斤。
    上海南北货、中药材两个行业在公私合营后，曾经一度由于行政管理机关限制过严过死，自由采购陷于停顿，使不少商品供应紧张。最近，在专业公司领导下取消了不合理的限制，组织大批有经验的采购人员前往各地自由采购，许多长期断档的商品重新获得了货源，药材业从产地自由采购来沪的各种药材有四百七十五种、计四十二万斤。很久以来在市场上供应紧张的“姜虫”，最近通过产地小商贩和农民，共收购了三千多斤，足够全市使用半年。南北货也源源而来，在上海市场上断档已久的河南新郑红枣、宁波的黄澄、白药，著名的张家口蘑菇都重新和上海顾客见面。这些采购人员在产地商业部门的帮助下，不但觅得了亟需的货源，同时也恢复了原有的供销关系。
    上海的这些商业行业在开放自由市场以后，也发生了一些问题，一个是盲目运销，到货不平衡的现象，近来毛鸡和鱼鲜都到货过涌，商贩、农民来货一时不易脱售，已发生了因货物变质而烧毁的事情。同时随着自由市场的开放，过去基本上已被淘汰的商业中间人又活跃起来，在上海车站、码头小贩和农民来往较多的地方出现了一批“黄牛”（即中间人），他们对农民或小贩带来的农副产品哄抬抢购，低价买进，高价黑市售出。还有少数的商贩，弄虚作假，以坏充好，有些缺货的货物则赚取过高的利润。这都说明在开放自由市场的同时，必须相应地加强国家行政机关对它的领导。这些问题上海市商业部门正研究解决。（习平）
