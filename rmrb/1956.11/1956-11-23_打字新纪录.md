Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, November 22nd: Lu Chuanzhen, a typist in a factory in Luoyang, can type an average of 4,730 characters per hour, setting a new national typing record and being selected as an advanced producer in Henan Province.

    The typing room of this factory has seven typists, five of whom can type an average of 4,000 characters per hour. They are all very modest and often learn from each other, jointly studying ways to improve their work. For example, based on their own experience, they changed many single characters in the original character plate into commonly used words in the factory. They changed the original character plate into sections such as production, capital construction, and politics, which saves both time and effort when typing.

    打字新纪录
    据新华社郑州22日电　洛阳一个工厂打字员路传真平均每小时能打四千七百三十个字，创造了全国打字的新成绩，被选为河南省先进生产者。
    这个工厂打字室共有七个打字员，有五个人平均每小时能打四千个字。他们都很虚心，常常相互学习，共同研究提高工作的方法。如他们根据自己的体验，把原来字盘里的许多单字改变为本工厂常用的词。把原来的字盘改为生产、基本建设、政治等部分，这样打起字来既省时间又省力。
