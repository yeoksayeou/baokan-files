    Weekend at the Seamen's Club
    Fan Rongkang
    I took a walk to the Seamen's Club on Saturday night. Pushing open the door, I heard lively锣鼓(gongs and drums), and walking towards the sound, I found that a play was being performed in the auditorium. The first two rows were occupied by foreign guests, seamen from a Japanese ship. The seats behind were full, occupied by staff and family members of the Qinhuangdao Port Authority. The side of the auditorium was also filled with spectators. I squeezed in and stood by the door. Tonight's performance was "Xiao Yuanmen." A comrade from the Port Authority told me it was a Shandong opera. I listened and watched. The singing style was very different from that of the Shandong Lü Opera Troupe, and it had a bit of the flavor of Hebei Bangzi.
    The performers were from the Port Authority's amateur troupe. Most of the actors were workers. Ren Meide, who played Fan Lihua, was an advanced worker in the loading and unloading team. The person playing Xue Dingshan was said to be a driver from the loading and unloading team's machinery group. The troupe leader – the labor union chairman of the loading and unloading team's first squad – told me that the actors had worked the early shift today, getting off work at two in the afternoon. Without even going home, they rehearsed the play. They hadn't rested since four or five o'clock in the morning. I interjected, "Aren't you tired?" The troupe leader said, "Tired? Not at all. They love singing, they're addicted to it." Someone next to him chimed in, "That's right! They're addicted to performing; the audience is addicted to watching. Look at everyone sitting in the auditorium, aren't they all people who just got off work?"
    The word "addiction" brought a crowd of people over, who began telling me a story. It turned out that this amateur Shandong opera troupe had another name, called the Victory Troupe. Why was it called the Victory Troupe? It went like this: Most of the staff at the Qinhuangdao Port Authority were from Shandong and loved to listen to Shandong opera, loved to sing Shandong opera, but there were no Shandong opera troupes here. In the past, when the Kuomintang was in power, a few workers who could sing Shandong opera would occasionally meet and, on a whim, start singing. Later, these people often sang together, and the audience grew larger and larger, from inside rooms, courtyards, and eventually to singing on the streets. They set up a stage on the street, beat drums, and sang a cappella. They didn't charge money, just to give Shandong folks a chance to listen to the opera of their hometown. Unexpectedly, this little pleasure, this hard-to-part-with homesickness, also bothered the Kuomintang government. They sent police to drive them away. The more they drove them away, the angrier the workers became, and the more they wanted to sing. Several drums were broken, several gongs were smashed, they were driven away here and there, and the workers' enthusiasm for singing grew even stronger. At that time, singing was no longer just for amusement, but also for venting anger. After liberation, life changed, and everyone was busy, so they initially put aside the singing. But the opera that the workers liked, after all, couldn't be forgotten. In recent years, many people have made suggestions, requesting the establishment of a troupe to sing Shandong opera. The labor union adopted this suggestion and organized the troupe, with more than forty members. At the first meeting, they discussed naming the troupe. Someone said, "In the past, the Kuomintang didn't allow us to sing; now that we are liberated, the labor union organizes us to sing, and we will perform on stage. Isn't this the result of revolutionary victory? Let's call it the Victory Troupe!" So, the name was decided.
    The leader of the Victory Troupe told me that the next play was "The Fisherman's Revenge." Sun Yueliang, a worker from the loading and unloading team's thirty-fifth group, would play Xiao En. Sun Yueliang had been singing Shandong opera for more than ten years and had been on stage before. Almost all the actors in the Victory Troupe were taught by him.
    I bid farewell to the Seamen's Club and stepped onto the street. Looking at my watch, it was only eight o'clock. Thinking of the bustling night markets in Beijing, this small coastal city had few pedestrians. However, the weekend here is not lonely either. Our workers love opera, love ball games, love all kinds of literature, art, and sports activities. They arrange their lives so richly that it often surprises some people.
    Of course, these hobbies of the workers need to be organized in order to enrich their lives.

    海员俱乐部的周末
    范荣康
    星期六晚上到海员俱乐部去走走。推开大门，只听得锣鼓敲得很热闹，迎声走去，却是礼堂里在演戏。前两排坐着外宾，是从日本船上下来的海员，后面席无虚设，都是秦皇岛港务管理局的职工和家属，太平门旁也站满了观众。我挤进去，挨在门旁。今夜演的是“小辕门”。港务管理局的同志告诉我，这是山东戏。听听，看看，同山东吕剧团演出的吕剧唱腔大不相同，风格也不一样，倒有几分像河北梆子。
    演出的是港务管理局的业余剧团。演员们大部分都是工人。扮樊梨花的任美德，是装卸队里的先进生产者。扮薛丁山的，听说是装卸队机械组的司机。剧团的团长——装卸队一分队的工会主席告诉我，演员们今天做的是早班，午后两点下班，也没有顾上回家，就排戏；打从早上四、五点钟起，到现在还没有歇过脚。我插了一句：“这不累吗？”团长说：“累？才不呢。他们爱唱戏的，有瘾。”旁边也有人接口道：“可不！唱戏的有瘾；听戏的也有瘾。瞧那礼堂里坐着的，那个不是干完活刚从班上下来？”
    这“瘾”字招来一大批人，七嘴八舌地向我讲了个故事。原来这个业余山东戏剧团还有个名字，叫胜利剧团。为什么叫胜利剧团呢？事情是这样的：秦皇岛港务管理局的职工大都是山东人，爱听山东戏，爱唱山东戏，但这里没有山东戏班子。以前，还是国民党统治的时候，有几个会唱山东戏的职工偶尔碰在一起，一时兴起，便唱起来。后来，这几个人就常在一起唱，听众也一次比一次多，从屋里，院里，最后发展到在大街上唱了。他们在大街上拉开场子，敲起锣鼓，清唱。不收钱，只是为了让山东老乡都有机会听听故乡的戏曲。不料工人们的这点乐趣，这点难舍的乡土之情，竟也碍了国民党政府的眼。他们派了警察来撵。越撵，工人越恼，越是要唱。踩破了好几只鼓，摔破了好几只锣，这儿撵，那儿撵，工人们唱戏的劲头更大了。那时，唱戏已不只是解闷，还是泄愤。解放后生活变了样，大家都忙，起先倒也把唱戏的事搁下了。但工人喜欢的戏，毕竟是忘不掉的。这些年来就有许多人提意见，要求成立个剧团唱山东戏，工会采纳了这个意见，把剧团组织起来，团员有四十多个。一开会，研究给剧团起个名。有人说：“从前国民党不让我们唱戏；现在解放了，工会组织我们唱戏，还要上台上去唱。这不是革命胜利的结果吗？就叫胜利剧团吧！”于是，就把名字定下来。
    胜利剧团的团长告诉我，下一出戏是“打渔杀家”。剧团里的台柱，装卸队三十五组的工人孙月亮演萧恩。孙月亮唱山东戏有十多年的历史，以前就登过台。胜利剧团里的演员，差不多都是他教出来的。
    辞别海员俱乐部，跨上街头。看夜光表，才八点。想北京城内夜市正盛，这海滨小城里行人已很稀少了。然而，这里的周末也不寂寞。我们的工人爱戏、爱球、爱各种各类的文学艺术和体育活动。他们把自己的生活安排得这样丰富，常常会使一些人吃惊。
    当然，工人们的这些爱好，需要加以组织，才能使生活丰富起来。
