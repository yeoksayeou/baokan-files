    To Egypt
    Xue Shen

    I have seen the night view of Suez, with its myriad lights;
    White sea vessels, sailing through the azure canal.
    I have seen a robust farmer, with a tanned, smiling face,
    He held up—a pinch of Egyptian soil.
    I have seen a team of young women, shouldering rifles,
    Their broad strides and serious expressions, revealing unprecedented dignity.
    I have seen Nasser's smile, from his works—
    Egypt is like a giant breaking free from its shackles!
    The cheers from the port of Alexandria, still echo in my ears,
    The green Egyptian flag, fluttering in the azure sky.
    …Suddenly, from the shores of the Red Sea came the smoke of war,
    The enemy wants to use bayonets and bullets, to once again subdue Egypt.
    Nasser has issued the order,
    Egyptian youth has sounded the charge,
    Driving out tanks, fixing bayonets,
    Using blood to defend independence and freedom!
    I cannot breathe freely,
    Anger boils in my heart,
    Brothers, at your call,
    I will raise the banner of righteousness,
    Pick up a gun!

    致埃及
    雪深我看见过苏伊士的夜景，万盏灯火；白色的海轮，驰过蔚蓝色的运河。我看见过一位健壮的农民，棕红的笑脸，他手里捧起——一撮埃及的泥土。我看见过一队年青妇女，扛起了枪杆，宽阔的步伐和严肃的脸色，显露出从未有的尊严。我看见过纳赛尔的笑容，从他的著作中——埃及像一位巨人击断了束缚的锁链！亚历山大港口的欢呼声，还响在我耳边，绿色的埃及国旗，在碧蓝的天空中飘舞。……突然，从红海之滨传来了战火的硝烟，敌人要用刺刀和枪弹，重新使埃及屈服。纳赛尔已经发出号令，埃及青年吹出了冲锋号声，开出战车，上好刺刀，用鲜血来捍卫独立和自由！我不能畅快地呼吸，愤怒在心胸沸腾，兄弟，你一声召唤，我将举起义旗，拿起枪杆！
