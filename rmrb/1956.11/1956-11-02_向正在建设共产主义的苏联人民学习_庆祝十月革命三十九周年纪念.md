    Learn from the Soviet People Who Are Building Communism
    -- Celebrating the 39th Anniversary of the October Revolution --
    Qian Jiaju
    In May of this year, I participated in the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association's delegation to visit our great ally, the Soviet Union. We stayed in the Soviet Union for nearly two months, visiting Moscow and Leningrad, as well as the three Soviet Socialist Republics of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Latvia. We visited some factories, state farms, collective farms, scientific research institutions, schools, museums, art galleries, etc.; we had extensive contact with Soviet workers, farmers, intellectuals, and people from all walks of life; and we made many reports to the working people of various Soviet regions on China's socialist industrialization and socialist transformation, which were warmly welcomed. Although our time in the Soviet Union was short, the Soviet people left a deep impression on us. This visit was indeed the most pleasant trip of my life. I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to the Soviet people, especially the comrades of the Soviet Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries.
    Our visit to the Soviet Union coincided with a time shortly after the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, when the Soviet people were united and working selflessly and tirelessly to realize the Sixth Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy. The whole country displayed a vigorous spirit to implement the resolutions of the 20th Party Congress. During our visit to the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union adopted a series of new measures to consolidate world peace and ease international tensions. After the visit of Bulganin and Khrushchev to the UK, the Soviet government took the initiative to announce its readiness to cut its armed forces by 1.2 million. This was followed by a meeting between the leaders of the Soviet Union and France, and the visit of Yugoslav President Tito to the Soviet Union, as well as the publication of a joint communiqué. These were all great victories for the Soviet Union's peaceful foreign policy. During this period, we also saw tens of thousands of Soviet youths responding to the call of the Party and the government to participate in the development of resources in the eastern and northern regions; we saw the Soviet people displaying a high degree of patriotism, overfulfilling the task of subscribing to the 1956 national bond in just one week. We personally witnessed the rise in the material and cultural life of the Soviet people, and saw how they lived in a prosperous and happy socialist family. All of this deeply encouraged us and made us realize that the Soviet people, under the correct leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, are victoriously advancing towards building the most beautiful communist society in the world.
    During the visit, what moved me the most and left the deepest impression?
    First, it was their brilliant achievements in land reclamation. Land reclamation is of great significance in developing Soviet agricultural production. During our visit to the Kazakh Republic, we visited the Aksengersky State Grain Farm in the Dzhambul region. This was a newly reclaimed area, about 200 kilometers from Alma-Ata, which a year and a half ago was a sparsely populated, weed-covered grassland with no roads or buildings. Two years ago, the Party issued a call for land reclamation, and in December 1954 the government decided to reclaim land here and establish a state grain farm. In January of last year, the Party sent seven comrades as the vanguard, and these seven people became the core team for land reclamation. At that time, because there were no roads and it was the dead of winter, they came by sleigh. Later, a large number of volunteer land reclaimers came from all over the country. The main difficulty at that time was how to create conditions for them to settle down in a grassland area that had never been inhabited before. Material conditions were very difficult. There were no houses at all. There were frequent blizzards, the climate was bitterly cold, and even fuel had to be transported from 100 kilometers away. But these volunteer land reclaimers overcame all difficulties, and the government gave them all the support, sending them twenty-two carriages. They used three carriages as dining halls and retail stores, and the remaining nineteen as dormitories and offices. They used local materials, using local reeds and cinder to build houses. The lakes nearby were surrounded by dense reeds. The reeds were harvested, squeezed, and then sewn together with metal wire to become excellent building materials. This kind of reed can not only be used to build houses, but also to build sheepfolds and cattle sheds, which are warm in winter and cool in summer, and durable. After more than a year of hard work, when we went to visit, this was already a vibrant and youthful new village. This state farm has 48,000 hectares (approximately 720,000 mu) of land, of which 24,000 hectares are arable land, and the rest are used as pastures. In one year, this farm delivered 250,000 poods of grain to the state (each pood is equivalent to 32.76 jin). They raised 32,000 sheep and 780 cattle, and each sheep can shear four kilograms of wool. This year, they will also increase the planting of vegetables by 250 hectares and potatoes by 200 hectares. Due to the use of local materials, the task of building houses last year was completed by 200%. Although this grain farm is 200 kilometers away from Alma-Ata, their cultural life is not lacking. Radio, newspapers, and magazines can transmit all the news here. Seeing such a vibrant new village, no one would have thought that this place was a sparsely populated grassland area a year and a half ago! There is more than one such reclaimed farm. There are 337 in the Kazakh Republic alone.
    Secondly, the Kazakh and Kyrgyz Republics we visited are both multi-ethnic countries. Before the October Revolution, they were backward agricultural areas. In just over 30 years, these two countries not only have highly developed industries and large-scale mechanized agriculture, but also have developed national cultures with socialist content. The rapid development of these two countries is an example of the glorious achievements of the Soviet Union in correctly implementing the Leninist national policy. Taking the Kazakh Republic as an example, its development speed can be seen from the growth of national economic investment: the first five-year plan invested 1.5 billion rubles, the second five-year plan increased to 3 billion rubles, the third five-year plan 4 billion rubles, the fourth five-year plan 8 billion rubles, the fifth five-year plan 29 billion rubles, and the sixth five-year plan increased to 78 billion rubles, which is a faster growth rate than geometric progression. Most of these investments are used to develop power bases, non-ferrous metallurgical industries, coal mining industries, petroleum industries, chemical industries, machine manufacturing industries, and railway transportation, etc., of which 20% are used to develop agriculture. Taking the Kyrgyz Republic as another example, the Kyrgyz Republic has fertile land, high mountains, and lush grass, which is a natural agricultural and pastoral area. In the past 30 years, it has not only developed collective agricultural and pastoral industries, but also has many highly mechanized heavy and light industries.
    In order to further enhance the initiative and creativity of the various union republics, after the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the powers of the various union republics were expanded. Due to the rapid development of the union republics in economic and cultural aspects, and the rapid growth of national intellectuals, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union decided to increase the number of departments in the union republics, expand the powers of the various departments of the union republics, and allow them to independently decide on specific issues related to the development of a certain economic sector. For example, the Kazakh Republic has newly established the Ministry of Geology, the Ministry of Non-Ferrous Metal Industry, the Ministry of Chemical Plant and Metallurgical Plant Construction, and has transferred some enterprises formerly managed by the Soviet government to the relevant departments of the Republic for management.
    In terms of the training of national cadres, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan were severely lacking cadres in the early days of the October Revolution, and the proportion of illiteracy was very high. The Party sent many experienced Russian engineers, doctors, professors, and agronomists to help them train their own national cadres and impart their experience and technology. Now, in all state administrative organs, factories, schools, and collective farms in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, most of the leading cadres are from the local nationalities. Comrade Razzakov, the first secretary of the Kyrgyz Party Central Committee, told us with great excitement: "Great assistance comes from the Russian people." Through practical life, the Kyrgyz people have personally experienced the fundamental changes that have taken place in their lives in a short period of time. Under the leadership of the Party, and with the help of the great Russian people, they have formed a socialist nation, transformed into a prosperous industrial and collective agricultural republic, and formed today's big family of friendly cooperation, thus generating their gratitude and deep friendship with the Russian people. This is a typical example of an advanced nation helping a backward nation to advance together.
    In the Kyrgyz Republic, there is a Dungan ethnic group, most of whom migrated from Gansu and Ningxia in our country. We visited the Desheng Collective Farm, which is mainly composed of Dungans and includes 14 other ethnic groups. The chairman of the farm, Li Zhanshan, whose ancestral home is in Ningxia, his ancestors fled to Russia more than 80 years ago due to the oppression of the Qing government and settled down in Kyrgyzstan. They are all working people and illiterate, but after the October Revolution, the Soviet regime helped them create a phonetic alphabet in Chinese (using Russian letters for transcription), and there are phonetic reading materials in Chinese in primary schools. Therefore, after more than 80 years, they can still communicate with us in Chinese, although the language they use is more than 80 years ago, and there are some differences from our modern language today. The Institute of Oriental Languages of the Kyrgyz Republic Academy of Sciences has a special Dungan group dedicated to studying the language and grammar of the Dungan language and compiling a Dungan-Russian dictionary. This shows that the Soviet regime adopts a positive approach to any ethnic group, helping them develop their national culture.
    During our visits to Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, we deeply felt how the Communist Party of the Soviet Union cares about strengthening and developing the fraternal friendship between the various ethnic groups of the Soviet Union. It not only does not obliterate the differences and characteristics of the nationalities, but also makes every effort to ensure the comprehensive development of the economy and culture of all nationalities and tribes.
    Finally, what moved me deeply and was of profound educational significance was the high degree of internationalism displayed by the Soviet people and their deep, brotherly friendship with the Chinese people. Wherever the delegation visited, it received the warmest welcome from the Soviet people. They extended their hands of friendship everywhere. Whether it was factories, farms, or scientific and cultural institutions, all the doors were open to the Chinese delegation. When we arrived in Alma-Ata, the capital of the Kazakh Republic, the Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Republic, the Minister of Culture, and the heads of the Republic's Party and government organs, as well as people from scientific and cultural circles, all greeted us at the airport. Among them was Comrade Aldabergenov, the Chairman of the Stalin Collective Farm, who had specially traveled from 250 kilometers away to Alma-Ata to greet us. When we went to visit the Kyrgyz Republic, we were warmly welcomed by people from all walks of life in the Republic's Party and government, 38 kilometers away from Frunze, the capital of the Republic. On the journey, strangers on the road often waved and greeted us, extending greetings to the Chinese people. When we visited Issyk-Kul Lake (in the 7th century AD, the Tang Dynasty monk Xuanzang passed through here on his westward journey, which is recorded in the "Great Tang Records on the Western Regions" as "Daqingdi"), we passed a Soviet military sanatorium. When the comrades of the sanatorium heard that the Chinese delegation was passing by, they specially sent representatives to welcome us by the roadside and invited us to visit the sanatorium. When we arrived at the sanatorium, all the officers and officers' families lined up and applauded to welcome us, the children presented us with flowers, and the officers delivered welcome speeches. When we came out of the Volodarsky Sewing Factory in Leningrad, more than 3,000 female workers from the factory waved goodbye to us from the windows on each of the six floors. Every time we went out and came back, we always had bunches of flowers in our hands, and sometimes the flowers filled the small cars. Such warm friendship is truly endless.
    At the same time, the unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples is being tightly connected by ties in economic and cultural aspects. During our short visit, we personally saw that the Alma-Ata Heavy Machinery Manufacturing Plant in Kazakhstan was manufacturing the latest machine tools for China, to be used by our factories in Anshan, Luoyang, and Qiqihar. The Alamodin State Plantation Farm is cultivating productive Tian Shan dairy cows for China, preparing to transport them to our country. At the Riga Silk Weaving Factory in the Latvian Republic, we saw that they were using natural silk produced in Hangzhou, China to weave bright and dazzling silk fabrics, and we saw that the VEF Electrotechnical Factory in Riga was manufacturing "Peace" brand radios, which are popular among the Chinese people. In terms of scientific culture and art, cultural exchanges between the Chinese and Soviet peoples are also developing day by day.
    The Soviet people have a great interest in the socialist construction and socialist transformation of the Chinese people, and they rejoice at the victory of our country on the socialist construction front as their own victory. They are concerned about China's socialist industrialization, agricultural collectivization, the transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, and China's reform of the Chinese characters. We made a total of 37 reports in the Soviet Union, and the total number of people who listened to the reports exceeded 10,000. Each time, we were generally welcomed by the Soviet audience. After the reports, they always asked many specific questions, and after we answered them, they applauded warmly, expressing their satisfaction. They said that not only are we learning from them, but they also want to learn from us. They emphasized mutual learning and also asked us to point out the shortcomings in their work. The humble attitude of the Soviet people is also worthy of our admiration.
    The above are the most profound impressions I gained from this visit to the Soviet Union.
    We want to convey and introduce to all the Chinese people everything we have seen and learned in the Soviet Union. We must learn from the spirit of selfless labor shown by the Soviet people after the 20th Congress of the Party in order to realize the Sixth Five-Year Plan; we must learn from the hard work of the Soviet people in building a beautiful communist society and their hard-working and simple lifestyle; we must learn from the realistic working attitude of the Soviet people; we must learn from the internationalist spirit of friendship of the Soviet people, combined with a high degree of patriotism. Finally, we must also respond to the expectations and love of the Soviet people for the Chinese people with more intensive work and more diligent construction. Long live the eternal and unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples!

    向正在建设共产主义的苏联人民学习
    ——庆祝十月革命三十九周年纪念——
    千家驹
    今年5月间，我参加了中苏友好协会的访苏代表团去我们伟大的盟邦苏联参观访问。我们在苏联逗留了将近两个月，除访问了莫斯科和列宁格勒外，还访问了哈萨克、吉尔吉斯、拉脱维亚三个苏维埃社会主义共和国。我们参观了一些工厂、国营农场、集体农庄、科学研究机关、学校、博物馆、美术馆等等；曾经和苏联的工人、农民、知识分子以及各界人士进行了广泛的接触；向苏联各地劳动人民做了许多次关于我国社会主义工业化和社会主义改造的报告，受到了他们热烈的欢迎。我们在苏联的日子虽然短促，但是苏联人民留给我们的印象是十分深刻的，这次的访问的确是我生平最愉快的一次旅行。我这里愿意首先向苏联人民，特别是苏联对外文化协会的同志们表示衷心的感谢。
    在我们访苏期间，恰好是在苏共二十次代表大会举行之后不久，苏联人民正在团结一致，为实现发展国民经济的第六个五年计划而进行忘我的劳动与不倦的努力，举国都表现了一种为贯彻二十次党代表大会决议的蓬勃奋发的精神。在我们访苏期间，苏联在巩固世界和平，缓和国际紧张局势方面采取了一系列的新措施，在布尔加宁、赫鲁晓夫访英归来之后，苏联政府主动宣布准备裁撤武装部队一百二十万人，接着有苏法两国领导人的会谈，和南斯拉夫总统铁托的访问苏联，以及两国会谈公报的发表。这些都是苏联和平外交政策的巨大胜利。在这期间，我们也看到了成千成万的苏联青年为响应党和政府的号召去参加开发东部和北部富源的工作；看到了苏联人民发挥高度的爱国主义精神，在短短的一个星期内超额完成了1956年国家公债的认购任务。我们亲眼看到了苏联人民物质生活和文化生活的高涨，看到他们如何生活在繁荣而幸福的社会主义大家庭中。这些都深深地鼓舞了我们，使我们体会到苏联人民在苏联共产党的正确领导下，正在为建设人世间最美满的共产主义社会而胜利地前进。
    在参观访问中，什么是使我最受感动，印象最深的呢？
    首先是他们在垦荒方面所获得的辉煌成就。垦荒在发展苏联农业生产上有着重大的意义。我们在访问哈萨克共和国时曾经去江布尔区参观了一个阿克先根尔斯克国营谷物农场，这是一个新垦区，这地区离阿拉木图约二百公里，在一年半以前是渺无人烟、荒草遍野的草原地带，既没有道路，也没有一幢建筑物。两年前，党发出了垦荒的号召，1954年12月政府决定在这里开荒，创设国营谷物农场，去年1月党派了七个同志为先锋队，这七个人就成为开荒的核心小组，当时因为没有道路，又值严冬季节，他们是坐雪橇来的。后来又从全国各地来了大批的志愿垦荒者。当时最主要的困难是如何创造条件，使他们能在从来无人居住的草原地带定居下来。物质条件是非常困难的，根本没有房子，时常有暴风雪，气候酷冷，连燃料也须从一百公里以外运来。但是这些志愿垦荒者克服了一切困难，同时政府给他们以一切的支援，给送来了二十二个车厢，他们就以三个车厢作为食堂和零售店，其余的十九个作为宿舍和办公房。他们就地取材，利用了当地的芦苇和煤渣建筑起房子来。附近的湖泊周围长着稠密的芦丛，把芦草收割加以压榨，然后用金属丝把它穿缝起来就成为绝好的建筑材料。这种芦苇不仅可以建造房屋，而且用为羊棚牛棚也是冬暖夏凉、结实耐用。经过了一年多的辛勤劳动，当我们去参观时，这里已经是充满活力和青春的一个新村了。这一国营农场拥有四万八千公顷（约合七十二万市亩）的土地，其中可耕地为二万四千公顷，其余的作为牧场。一年以来，他们建筑了适用、经济而又相当舒适的住宅、食堂、俱乐部、学校和商店。1955年内这个农场便上缴国家二十五万普特的粮食（每普特合三十二点七六市斤），他们养了三万二千只羊，七百八十头牛，每只羊可以剪四公斤羊毛。今年还要增种二百五十公顷的蔬菜和二百公顷的马铃薯。由于就地取材，去年建筑房屋任务完成了200％。这一谷物农场虽离阿拉木图有二百公里，但是他们的文化生活并不缺乏，无线电、报纸、杂志可以把一切新闻传送到这里。看到了这么一个朝气勃勃的新村，谁也不会想到这儿在一年半以前还是个渺无人烟的草原地带呢！像这样的垦荒农场不止一个，仅哈萨克共和国就有三百三十七个。
    其次，我们所访问的哈萨克和吉尔吉斯共和国都是多民族的国家，在十月革命以前是落后的农业地区，在短短的三十多年内，这两个国家不但有高度发达的工业，有大规模的机械化农业，而且还发展了民族形式和社会主义内容的民族文化。这两个国家的飞跃发展是苏联正确地执行列宁主义民族政策辉煌成就的范例。以哈萨克共和国为例，它的发展速度从国民经济投资的增长中可以看出：第一个五年计划投资十五亿卢布，第二个五年计划增为三十亿卢布，第三个五年计划四十亿卢布，第四个五年计划八十亿卢布，第五个五年计划二百九十亿卢布，第六个五年计划更增加为七百八十亿卢布，这是比几何级数还要快的增长速度。这些投资大部分用于发展动力基地，有色冶金工业、煤矿工业、石油工业、化学、机器制造业以及铁路交通等等上面，其中有20％用于发展农业。再以吉尔吉斯共和国来说，吉尔吉斯共和国土地肥沃，山高草茂，正是一个天然的农牧地区。三十年来，它不仅发展了集体化的农牧业，而且有许多高度机械化的重工业和轻工业。
    为了进一步提高各加盟共和国的主动创造性，在苏共第二十次代表大会后，各加盟共和国的职权扩大了。由于各加盟共和国在经济和文化方面的迅速发展，民族知识分子迅速的增长，苏联共产党决定增加各加盟共和国的部，扩大加盟共和国各部的职权，让他们自行决定发展某一经济部门的具体问题。例如在哈萨克共和国新设立了地质部，有色金属工业部，化学工厂和冶金工厂建设部，并且把过去归苏联政府管理的一些企业划归共和国各有关部门去管理。
    在民族干部的培养上，哈萨克斯坦和吉尔吉斯在十月革命初期干部是十分缺乏的，文盲占很大比重，党派来了许多有经验的俄罗斯工程师、医生、教授、农学家，帮助他们培养自己的民族干部，传授给他们以经验和技术。现在哈萨克斯坦和吉尔吉斯所有国家行政机关、工厂、学校、集体农庄中，大部分是本民族的领导干部。吉尔吉斯党中央第一书记拉扎科夫同志以十分兴奋的心情告诉我们说：“伟大的援助来自俄罗斯人民。”吉尔吉斯人民通过生活的实践，亲自体验到在短短的时期内他们的生活发生了根本的变化，在党的领导下，由于伟大的俄罗斯人民的帮助而形成了社会主义的民族，变成了繁荣的工业和集体农业的共和国，形成了今日友好合作的民族大家庭，因而产生了他们对俄罗斯人的感激心情与深厚友谊。这是先进的民族帮助后进的民族一道前进的一个典型的范例。
    在吉尔吉斯共和国中，有一个东甘民族，大部分是从我国甘肃、宁夏迁居过去的。我们曾参观了一个以东甘人为主包括其他十四个民族在内所组成的得胜集体农庄，农庄主席李占山，祖籍宁夏，他的祖先在八十多年前受清政府压迫逃到俄国去，就在吉尔吉斯定居下来。他们都是劳动人民，无人识字，但在十月革命后，苏维埃政权帮助他们创造汉语的拼音文字（用俄文字母拼音），在小学中有汉语的拼音读本，因此在八十多年后还能用汉语和我们交谈，虽然他们所用的语言都是八十多年以前的，和我们今天的现代语言有些出入。在吉尔吉斯共和国科学院的东方语言研究所中特设有东甘组，专研究东甘语的语言、文法并编著东甘语俄文辞典。这可以说明苏维埃政权对任何一个民族都是采取积极的方针，帮助他们发展本民族的文化的。
    在哈萨克和吉尔吉斯的访问中，我们深深地体会到苏联共产党是如何关怀着加强和发展苏联各族人民之间的兄弟友谊，它不但不抹煞民族的差别和特点，而且以全力保证各民族和各部族的经济和文化得以全面的发展。
    最后，使我深受感动，并富有深刻教育意义的，乃是苏联人民所表现的那种高度的国际主义精神和他们对于中国人民深厚的兄弟般的友谊。访苏代表团所到之处，都受到了苏联人民最热烈的欢迎，他们到处伸出了友谊的手，无论是工厂、农场、科学文化机关，所有的门都为中国代表团开着。当我们抵达哈萨克共和国的首都阿拉木图时，共和国的部长会议副主席，文化部长，和共和国党政机关负责人，科学文化界人士都在机场迎接我们，其中有斯大林集体农庄主席阿尔达别尔根诺夫同志，他是特地从二百五十公里远的地方赶到阿拉木图来迎接的。当我们去吉尔吉斯共和国访问时，在远离共和国首都伏龙芝三十八公里的地方就受到了共和国党政各界社会人士热烈的欢迎。在旅途中，马路上常有不相识的人向我们招手问好，向中国人民问候。我们游览伊斯库里湖（纪元七世纪时，玄奘法师曾经此西行即“大唐西域记”中所载的“大清地”）时，路过一苏联军人休养所，休养所的军人同志们听说中国代表团路过，特地派代表来路旁欢迎，邀请我们去休养所参观，当我们到达休养所时，所有的军官和军官家属都列队鼓掌欢迎，儿童们向我们献花，军官向我们致欢迎辞。当我们在列宁格勒参观沃洛达尔斯基缝纫工厂出来时，该厂的三千多女工从六层楼的每一层楼窗上伸出手来和我们告别。我们每次出去回来，手里总拿着一束束鲜花，有时鲜花把小座车都塞满了。像这样热烈的友情真是说不完，讲不尽的。
    同时，中苏两国人民牢不可破的友谊，正在经济、文化各方面的纽带紧紧地连接着。就在我们短短的参观访问中，我们就亲眼看到了哈萨克斯坦的阿拉木图重型机器制造厂正在为中国制造最新式的机床，供应我国的鞍山、洛阳、齐齐哈尔的工厂使用。在阿拉莫金国营种植农场正在为中国培养多产的天山种乳牛，准备运来我国。我们在拉脱维亚共和国的里加丝织工厂看到了他们正在用我国杭州出产的天然丝织出鲜艳夺目的丝绸，看到了里加的威夫电器技术工厂正在制造为中国人民所欢迎的“和平牌”无线电收音机。在科学文化艺术方面，中苏两国人民的文化交流也日益发展着。
    苏联人民对中国人民社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业抱着莫大的兴趣，他们把我国在建设社会主义战线上的胜利当成自己的胜利而欢欣鼓舞。他们关心中国的社会主义工业化、农业合作化、资本主义工商业改造，以及我国的汉字改革问题。我们在苏联总共做了三十七次报告，听报告的人数总计超过一万人，每次都受到了苏联听众普遍的欢迎，在报告之后，他们总提出了许多具体问题，经我们答复后他们热烈鼓掌，表示满意。他们说不仅仅是我们向他们学习，同时他们也要向我们学习，他们强调相互学习，还要我们指出他们工作中的缺点，苏联人民这种谦虚的态度也是值得我们钦佩的。
    以上几点，是我这一次访问苏联所得到最深刻的印象。
    我们要向全中国人民传达和介绍我们在苏联所看到的一切和所学习到的一切。我们要学习苏联人民在党二十次代表大会后为实现第六个五年计划所表现的那种忘我劳动的精神；我们要学习苏联人民为建设美满的共产主义社会而进行紧张劳动和他们那种艰苦朴素的生活作风；我们要学习苏联人民那种实事求是的工作态度；我们要学习苏联人民那种和高度爱国主义相结合的国际主义的友爱精神。最后，我们还一定要以更紧张的工作、更努力的建设来回答苏联人民对中国人民的期望和热爱。中苏两国人民永恒的牢不可破的友谊万岁！
