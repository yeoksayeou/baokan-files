    Learn from the Soviet People Who Are Building Communism
    -- Celebrating the 39th Anniversary of the October Revolution --

    In May of this year, I participated in the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association's delegation to visit our great ally, the Soviet Union. We stayed in the Soviet Union for nearly two months, visiting Moscow and Leningrad, as well as the three Soviet Socialist Republics of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Latvia. We visited some factories, state farms, collective farms, scientific research institutions, schools, museums, art galleries, etc.; we had extensive contact with Soviet workers, farmers, intellectuals, and people from all walks of life; and we made many reports to the working people of various Soviet regions on China's socialist industrialization and socialist transformation, which were warmly welcomed. Although our time in the Soviet Union was short, the Soviet people left a deep impression on us. This visit was indeed the most pleasant trip of my life. I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to the Soviet people, especially the comrades of the Soviet Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries.
    Our visit to the Soviet Union coincided with a time shortly after the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, when the Soviet people were united and working selflessly and tirelessly to realize the Sixth Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy. The whole country displayed a vigorous spirit to implement the resolutions of the 20th Party Congress. During our visit to the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union adopted a series of new measures to consolidate world peace and ease international tensions. After the visit of Bulganin and Khrushchev to the UK, the Soviet government took the initiative to announce its readiness to cut its armed forces by 1.2 million. This was followed by a meeting between the leaders of the Soviet Union and France, and the visit of Yugoslav President Tito to the Soviet Union, as well as the publication of a joint communiqu√©. These were all great victories for the Soviet Union's peaceful foreign policy. During this period, we also saw tens of thousands of Soviet youths responding to the call of the Party and the government to participate in the development of resources in the eastern and northern regions; we saw the Soviet people displaying a high degree of patriotism, overfulfilling the task of subscribing to the 1956 national bond in just one week. We personally witnessed the rise in the material and cultural life of the Soviet people, and saw how they lived in a prosperous and happy socialist family. All of this deeply encouraged us and made us realize that the Soviet people, under the correct leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, are victoriously advancing towards building the most beautiful communist society in the world.
    During the visit, what moved me the most and left the deepest impression?
    First, it was their brilliant achievements in land reclamation. Land reclamation is of great significance in developing Soviet agricultural production. During our visit to the Kazakh Republic, we visited the Aksengersky State Grain Farm in the Dzhambul region. This was a newly reclaimed area, about 200 kilometers from Alma-Ata, which a year and a half ago was a sparsely populated, weed-covered grassland with no roads or buildings. Two years ago, the Party issued a call for land reclamation, and in December 1954 the government decided to reclaim land here and establish a state grain farm. In January of last year, the Party sent seven comrades as the vanguard, and these seven people became the core team for land reclamation. At that time, because there were no roads and it was the dead of winter, they came by sleigh. Later, a large number of volunteer land reclaimers came from all over the country. The main difficulty at that time was how to create conditions for them to settle down in a grassland area that had never been inhabited before. Material conditions were very difficult. There were no houses at all. There were frequent blizzards, the climate was bitterly cold, and even fuel had to be transported from 100 kilometers away. But these volunteer land reclaimers overcame all difficulties, and the government gave them all the support, sending them twenty-two carriages. They used three carriages as dining halls and retail stores, and the remaining nineteen as dormitories and offices. They used local materials, using local reeds and cinder to build houses. The lakes nearby were surrounded by dense reeds. The reeds were harvested, squeezed, and then sewn together with metal wire to become excellent building materials. This kind of reed can not only be used to build houses, but also to build sheepfolds and cattle sheds, which are warm in winter and cool in summer, and durable. After more than a year of hard work, when we went to visit, this was already a vibrant and youthful new village. This state farm has 48,000 hectares (approximately 720,000 mu) of land, of which 24,000 hectares are arable land, and the rest are used as pastures. In one year, this farm delivered 250,000 poods of grain to the state (each pood is equivalent to 32.76 jin). They raised 32,000 sheep and 780 cattle, and each sheep can shear four kilograms of wool. This year, they will also increase the planting of vegetables by 250 hectares and potatoes by 200 hectares. Due to the use of local materials, the task of building houses last year was completed by 200%. Although this grain farm is 200 kilometers away from Alma-Ata, their cultural life is not lacking. Radio, newspapers, and magazines can transmit all the news here. Seeing such a vibrant new village, no one would have thought that this place was a sparsely populated grassland area a year and a half ago! There is more than one such reclaimed farm. There are 337 in the Kazakh Republic alone.
    Secondly, the Kazakh and Kyrgyz Republics we visited are both multi-ethnic countries. Before the October Revolution, they were backward agricultural areas. In just over 30 years, these two countries not only have highly developed industries and large-scale mechanized agriculture, but also have developed national cultures with socialist content. The rapid development of these two countries is an example of the glorious achievements of the Soviet Union in correctly implementing the Leninist national policy. Taking the Kazakh Republic as an example, its development speed can be seen from the growth of national economic investment: the first five-year plan invested 1.5 billion rubles, the second five-year plan increased to 3 billion rubles, the third five-year plan 4 billion rubles, the fourth five-year plan 8 billion rubles, the fifth five-year plan 29 billion rubles, and the sixth five-year plan increased to 78 billion rubles, which is a faster growth rate than geometric progression. Most of these investments are used to develop power bases, non-ferrous metallurgical industries, coal mining industries, petroleum industries, chemical industries, machine manufacturing industries, and railway transportation, etc., of which 20% are used to develop agriculture. Taking the Kyrgyz Republic as another example, the Kyrgyz Republic has fertile land, high mountains, and lush grass, which is a natural agricultural and pastoral area. In the past 30 years, it has not only developed collective agricultural and pastoral industries, but also has many highly mechanized heavy and light industries.
    In order to further enhance the initiative and creativity of the various union republics, after the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the powers of the various union republics were expanded. Due to the rapid development of the union republics in economic and cultural aspects, and the rapid growth of national intellectuals, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union decided to increase the number of departments in the union republics, expand the powers of the various departments of the union republics, and allow them to independently decide on specific issues related to the development of a certain economic sector. For example, the Kazakh Republic has newly established the Ministry of Geology, the Ministry of Non-Ferrous Metal Industry, the Ministry of Chemical Plant and Metallurgical Plant Construction, and has transferred some enterprises formerly managed by the Soviet government to the relevant departments of the Republic for management.
    In terms of the training of national cadres, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan were severely lacking cadres in the early days of the October Revolution, and the proportion of illiteracy was very high. The Party sent many experienced Russian engineers, doctors, professors, and agronomists to help them train their own national cadres and impart their experience and technology. Now, in all state administrative organs, factories, schools, and collective farms in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, most of the leading cadres are from the local nationalities. Comrade Razzakov, the first secretary of the Kyrgyz Party Central Committee, told us with great excitement: "Great assistance comes from the Russian people." Through practical life, the Kyrgyz people have personally experienced the fundamental changes that have taken place in their lives in a short period of time. Under the leadership of the Party, and with the help of the great Russian people, they have formed a socialist nation, transformed into a prosperous industrial and collective agricultural republic, and formed today's big family of friendly cooperation, thus generating their gratitude and deep friendship with the Russian people. This is a typical example of an advanced nation helping a backward nation to advance together.
    In the Kyrgyz Republic, there is a Dungan ethnic group, most of whom migrated from Gansu and Ningxia in our country. We visited the Desheng Collective Farm, which is mainly composed of Dungans and includes 14 other ethnic groups. The chairman of the farm, Li Zhanshan, whose ancestral home is in Ningxia, his ancestors fled to Russia more than 80 years ago due to the oppression of the Qing government and settled down in Kyrgyzstan. They are all working people and illiterate, but after the October Revolution, the Soviet regime helped them create a phonetic alphabet in Chinese (using Russian letters for transcription), and there are phonetic reading materials in Chinese in primary schools. Therefore, after more than 80 years, they can still communicate with us in Chinese, although the language they use is more than 80 years ago, and there are some differences from our modern language today. The Institute of Oriental Languages of the Kyrgyz Republic Academy of Sciences has a special Dungan group dedicated to studying the language and grammar of the Dungan language and compiling a Dungan-Russian dictionary. This shows that the Soviet regime adopts a positive approach to any ethnic group, helping them develop their national culture.
    During our visits to Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, we deeply felt how the Communist Party of the Soviet Union cares about strengthening and developing the fraternal friendship between the various ethnic groups of the Soviet Union. It not only does not obliterate the differences and characteristics of the nationalities, but also makes every effort to ensure the comprehensive development of the economy and culture of all nationalities and tribes.
    Finally, what moved me deeply and was of profound educational significance was the high degree of internationalism displayed by the Soviet people and their deep, brotherly friendship with the Chinese people. Wherever the delegation visited, it received the warmest welcome from the Soviet people. They extended their hands of friendship everywhere. Whether it was factories, farms, or scientific and cultural institutions, all the doors were open to the Chinese delegation. When we arrived in Alma-Ata, the capital of the Kazakh Republic, the Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Republic, the Minister of Culture, and the heads of the Republic's Party and government organs, as well as people from scientific and cultural circles, all greeted us at the airport. Among them was Comrade Aldabergenov, the Chairman of the Stalin Collective Farm, who had specially traveled from 250 kilometers away to Alma-Ata to greet us. When we went to visit the Kyrgyz Republic, we were warmly welcomed by people from all walks of life in the Republic's Party and government, 38 kilometers away from Frunze, the capital of the Republic. On the journey, strangers on the road often waved and greeted us, extending greetings to the Chinese people. When we visited Issyk-Kul Lake (in the 7th century AD, the Tang Dynasty monk Xuanzang passed through here on his westward journey, which is recorded in the "Great Tang Records on the Western Regions" as "Daqingdi"), we passed a Soviet military sanatorium. When the comrades of the sanatorium heard that the Chinese delegation was passing by, they specially sent representatives to welcome us by the roadside and invited us to visit the sanatorium. When we arrived at the sanatorium, all the officers and officers' families lined up and applauded to welcome us, the children presented us with flowers, and the officers delivered welcome speeches. When we came out of the Volodarsky Sewing Factory in Leningrad, more than 3,000 female workers from the factory waved goodbye to us from the windows on each of the six floors. Every time we went out and came back, we always had bunches of flowers in our hands, and sometimes the flowers filled the small cars. Such warm friendship is truly endless.
    At the same time, the unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples is being tightly connected by ties in economic and cultural aspects. During our short visit, we personally saw that the Alma-Ata Heavy Machinery Manufacturing Plant in Kazakhstan was manufacturing the latest machine tools for China, to be used by our factories in Anshan, Luoyang, and Qiqihar. The Alamodin State Plantation Farm is cultivating productive Tian Shan dairy cows for China, preparing to transport them to our country. At the Riga Silk Weaving Factory in the Latvian Republic, we saw that they were using natural silk produced in Hangzhou, China to weave bright and dazzling silk fabrics, and we saw that the VEF Electrotechnical Factory in Riga was manufacturing "Peace" brand radios, which are popular among the Chinese people. In terms of scientific culture and art, cultural exchanges between the Chinese and Soviet peoples are also developing day by day.
    The Soviet people have a great interest in the socialist construction and socialist transformation of the Chinese people, and they rejoice at the victory of our country on the socialist construction front as their own victory. They are concerned about China's socialist industrialization, agricultural collectivization, the transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, and China's reform of the Chinese characters. We made a total of 37 reports in the Soviet Union, and the total number of people who listened to the reports exceeded 10,000. Each time, we were generally welcomed by the Soviet audience. After the reports, they always asked many specific questions, and after we answered them, they applauded warmly, expressing their satisfaction. They said that not only are we learning from them, but they also want to learn from us. They emphasized mutual learning and also asked us to point out the shortcomings in their work. The humble attitude of the Soviet people is also worthy of our admiration.
    The above are the most profound impressions I gained from this visit to the Soviet Union.
    We want to convey and introduce to all the Chinese people everything we have seen and learned in the Soviet Union. We must learn from the spirit of selfless labor shown by the Soviet people after the 20th Congress of the Party in order to realize the Sixth Five-Year Plan; we must learn from the hard work of the Soviet people in building a beautiful communist society and their hard-working and simple lifestyle; we must learn from the realistic working attitude of the Soviet people; we must learn from the internationalist spirit of friendship of the Soviet people, combined with a high degree of patriotism. Finally, we must also respond to the expectations and love of the Soviet people for the Chinese people with more intensive work and more diligent construction. Long live the eternal and unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples!
