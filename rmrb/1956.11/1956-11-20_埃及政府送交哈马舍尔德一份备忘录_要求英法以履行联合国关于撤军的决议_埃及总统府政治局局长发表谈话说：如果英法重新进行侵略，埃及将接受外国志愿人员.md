Xinhua News Agency, November 19th, Cairo Dispatch: According to Cairo Radio, the Egyptian government submitted a memorandum to United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskjöld on November 18 regarding its views on the Middle East situation. Hammarskjöld had already left Cairo for New York on the same day.

In the memorandum, the Egyptian government urged Hammarskjöld to note the fact that, despite the United Nations General Assembly's resolution on the withdrawal of foreign troops from Egyptian territory, British and French troops have not yet withdrawn from Egyptian territory, and Israeli troops have not yet withdrawn behind the 1949 armistice line. On the contrary, they are strengthening their positions. At the same time, these troops are carrying out armed attacks on unarmed Egyptian people, searching houses, and forcibly compelling them to work.

In this memorandum, the Egyptian government expressed its deep hope that Britain, France, and Israel would fulfill the United Nations' recently adopted resolutions on troop withdrawal. The Egyptian government also requested Hammarskjöld to distribute this memorandum to all member states of the United Nations General Assembly.

Hammarskjöld arrived in Cairo on November 16. On the 16th and 17th, he held a series of talks with Egyptian President Nasser, Foreign Minister Fawzi, and others.

Xinhua News Agency, November 19th, Cairo Dispatch: The Director of the Political Bureau of the Egyptian Presidential Office, Sabri, stated this morning that if Britain and France resume aggression, Egypt will accept foreign volunteers.

Sabri's remarks, broadcast by Cairo Radio, also stated that any attempts by Britain and France to stay in the canal zone and clear the canal "will be considered a violation of the ceasefire resolution."

Sabri said that after the British and French attack, Egypt requested assistance from all countries on November 9. He said: "We are currently relying on the United Nations to resolve this issue. But if the aggression recurs, we will accept assistance from all countries." Sabri said: "Egypt has been slow to accept volunteers in order not to increase international tensions."

Sabri demanded that foreign troops begin to withdraw immediately. He also said that if Britain and France refuse to comply with the United Nations' orders and do not withdraw, the United States should stop shipping oil to Britain and France.

Sabri said that Egypt will demand full compensation from Britain, France, and Israel. He said: "Stopping the aggressors and promising them to withdraw without punishment is absolutely insufficient. Otherwise, all countries will be subject to such aggression."

Sabri denied reports that Egypt lost military supplies equivalent to 50 million US dollars as a result of the Israeli offensive in Sinai. He pointed out that these supplies consisted of only thirty medium tanks, forty military vehicles, and some British-made field guns.

Sabri charged that even before the British and French troops intervened in the dispute, the French Air Force had already been assisting Israel in launching an offensive in the Sinai region.

    埃及政府送交哈马舍尔德一份备忘录
    要求英法以履行联合国关于撤军的决议
    埃及总统府政治局局长发表谈话说：如果英法重新进行侵略，埃及将接受外国志愿人员
    新华社19日讯　开罗消息：据开罗电台广播，埃及政府11月18日把它对中东局势看法的备忘录送交联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德。哈马舍尔德已经在同一天离开开罗前往纽约。
    埃及政府在备忘录中促请哈马舍尔德注意这样一个事实：尽管联合国大会通过了外国军队撤出埃及领土的决议，但是到目前为止，英法军队还没有撤离埃及领土，以色列军队还没有撤到1949年停战线后面去。相反的，他们都在加强他们的阵地。同时，这些军队正在对非武装的埃及人民进行武装攻击，搜查房屋，用武力强迫他们工作。
    埃及政府在这份备忘录中表示深切地希望英法和以色列履行联合国最近通过的关于撤军的决议。埃及政府并且要求哈马舍尔德把这份备忘录分发给联合国大会各会员国。
    哈马舍尔德是在11月16日到达开罗的。在16日和17日，他曾经同埃及总统纳赛尔、外交部长法齐等举行了一系列的会谈。
    新华社19日讯　开罗消息：埃及总统府政治局局长萨布里今天早上发表谈话说，如果英法重新进行侵略，埃及将接受外国的志愿人员。
    由开罗电台广播的萨布里的谈话还说，英法想要呆在运河区和清除运河的任何尝试“都将被认为是违反停火决议的”。
    萨布里说，在英法进攻以后，埃及于11月9日向一切国家要求援助。他说：“我们目前依靠联合国来解决这个问题。但是如果侵略行动重新发生，我们将接受一切国家的援助。”萨布里说：“埃及迟迟不接受志愿人员，目的是不要增加国际紧张局势。”
    萨布里要求外国军队立即开始撤退。他还说，如果英法拒绝遵从联合国的命令而不撤退，美国应当停止把石油运给英法。
    萨布里说，埃及将向英国、法国和以色列要求全部赔偿。他说：“阻止侵略者和答应他们不受惩罚地撤退是绝对不够的。不然的话，所有国家都会受到这种侵略”。
    萨布里否认由于以色列进攻西奈的结果埃及损失的军事物资相当于五千万美元的消息。他指出，这些物资只有三十辆中型坦克、四十辆军用车辆和一些英国制的野战炮。
    萨布里指责说：甚至在英法军队干预这个争端以前，法国空军就已经在帮助以色列对西奈地区发动攻势。
