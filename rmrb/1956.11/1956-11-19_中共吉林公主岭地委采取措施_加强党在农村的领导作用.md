Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, November 15th: The CPC Jilin Gongzhuling Prefectural Committee, in response to the current trend of gradually weakening Party leadership in rural areas, has proposed measures for improvement.

The CPC Gongzhuling Prefectural Committee, based on a survey of forty-five agricultural cooperatives, found that after the realization of cooperation this year, the Party's ideological work did not keep up with the needs of cooperative development, and many agricultural cooperatives neglected the Party's leadership role. The Party's grassroots organizations are not active, and the phenomenon of blurring the lines between the Party, government, and cooperatives is prevalent. Major issues are not discussed through Party meetings, and in many places, the activities of Party organizations are hardly seen. According to a survey of twelve agricultural cooperatives in six townships in Yushu County, eleven cooperatives did not form a leadership core based on the Party branch committee. Instead, the cooperative director had the final say on both the work of the cooperative and the Party branch. In some agricultural cooperatives, even holding a branch meeting required "approval" from the cooperative director. The Party branch of the Erdaohuzi Agricultural Cooperative in Fanshen Township, Jiutai County, only held one branch meeting in seven months since its establishment. Due to the lack of strong Party leadership and the absence of regular ideological education through Party organizations, many grassroots leading cadres lacked a democratic style and exhibited relatively serious subjectivism and commandism. According to a survey of ten agricultural cooperatives in Taiyuan District, Fuyu County, twenty-nine production teams simply used deductions of work points to solve ideological problems of cooperative members. Yu Changhai, the Party general branch secretary of Xinli Township, Nongan County, did not adopt persuasive mobilization methods for cooperative members whose livestock had not yet joined the cooperative, but instead ordered people to forcibly drag the animals from the households keeping private animals.

After discovering the above problems, the CPC Jilin Gongzhuling Prefectural Committee convened a meeting of county Party committee secretaries to specifically discuss how to improve the leadership level of rural Party grassroots organizations. The meeting emphasized that strengthening the Party's leadership in rural work is the fundamental guarantee for developing agricultural production and increasing the income of cooperative members. Party grassroots organizations must regard strengthening leadership and supervision of the production and work of agricultural cooperatives as a regular central task. To this end, the meeting proposed to fully leverage the role of grassroots Party organizations. Regarding how rural Party grassroots organizations should strengthen collective leadership and establish regular working order, the meeting stipulated that major issues concerning agricultural cooperatives must be collectively discussed by Party grassroots organizations before a decision is made. Before the discussion, thorough investigation and research should be conducted to fully grasp the situation; during the discussion, democracy should be fully promoted, and any tendency to use meetings as a legal cover to implement individual decisions should be opposed. At the same time, the system of individual responsibility under collective leadership should be implemented, and a regular meeting system should be established.

The meeting also particularly emphasized that county and district leaders should quickly change their leadership style, strengthen investigation and research, proceed from reality in everything, start from the grassroots level, begin with reviewing and summarizing work, and earnestly improve the Party's leadership work.

    中共吉林公主岭地委采取措施
    加强党在农村的领导作用
    新华社长春15日电　中共吉林省公主岭地方工作委员会针对目前党在农村中的领导作用被逐渐削弱的倾向，提出了改进的措施。
    中共公主岭地方工作委员会从四十五个农业社的调查中，发现在今年实现合作化以后，党的思想工作没有及时跟上合作化发展的需要，不少农业社忽视了党的领导作用。党的基层组织不活跃，普遍存在党、政、社不分的现象，一些重大问题不经过党的会议研究，许多地方几乎看不到党组织的活动。据榆树县六个乡十二个农业社的调查，就有十一个社不是以党支委会形成领导核心，而是不论合作社的工作或党支部的工作都是由社主任说了算事。其中有的农业社连开支部会也得要社主任“批准”。九台县翻身乡二道河子农业社党支部成立了七个月，只召开过一次支部大会。由于党的领导不力，没有经常通过党组织进行思想教育，使许多基层领导干部作风不够民主，存在着较严重的主观主义和命令主义作风。据扶余县太原区十个农业社的调查，其中有二十九个生产队单纯以扣工分的办法来解决社员思想问题。农安县新立乡党总支书记于长海，对牲畜还未入社的社员不是采取说服动员的办法，而是叫人到留马户家硬拉。
    中共吉林省公主岭地方工作委员会发现上述问题以后，召开了各县县委书记会议，专门讨论了如何提高农村党的基层组织的领导水平问题。会议强调指出，加强党在农村工作中的领导作用，是发展农业生产、增加社员收入的根本保证，党的基层组织必须把加强对农业社的生产和工作的领导和监督当做经常的中心任务。为此，会议提出要充分发挥基层党组织的作用；对于农村党的基层组织如何加强集体领导并建立正规工作秩序的问题，会议规定：有关农业社的重大问题，必须经过党的基层组织集体讨论以后再作出决定。在讨论以前，要经过充分调查研究，全面掌握情况；在讨论时要充分发扬民主、反对任何以会议合法形式作为掩护而实行个人决定问题的偏向。同时，要实行集体领导下的个人分工负责制，并建立定期的会议制度。
    会议还特别强调各县、区领导应迅速转变领导作风，加强调查研究，一切要从实际出发，从基层出发，从检查总结工作入手，切实地改进党的领导工作。
