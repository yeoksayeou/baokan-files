Xinhua News Agency, November 15th — The academic community of the capital held an academic symposium on November 15th to commemorate the ninetieth anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's birth.

At the symposium, Hou Wailu, Ding Zeliang, and Li Shu delivered reports on specific topics such as Sun Yat-sen's philosophical thought and its relationship with political thought, Sun Yat-sen and the Asian national liberation struggle, and the social foundation of Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary activities.

In his report, "Sun Yat-sen's Philosophical Thought and its Relationship with Political Thought," Hou Wailu first analyzed that Sun Yat-sen was situated in an era of revolutionary storms, a time when new factors were constantly growing and strengthening while old things were gradually declining. This complex and contradictory era could not but be reflected in Sun Yat-sen's philosophical and political thought. Hou Wailu said that in studying Sun Yat-sen's thought, we must analyze and critically absorb its valuable achievements based on the specific historical conditions in which he lived.

Hou Wailu analyzed Sun Yat-sen's philosophical thought from three aspects: his worldview, epistemology, and theory of truth. He pointed out that Sun Yat-sen's philosophical thought, although incomplete and gradually maturing, closely approached materialism. Although there were elements of idealism, they were secondary in his ideological system. Hou Wailu cited many facts to prove Sun Yat-sen's contributions in these three aspects. The materialistic elements in Sun Yat-sen's worldview became the theoretical basis for his political progress.

Ding Zeliang reported on "Sun Yat-sen and the Asian National Liberation Struggle." He cited the anti-American war that broke out in the Philippines in 1899, illustrating that Sun Yat-sen not only dedicated his life to the liberation struggle of the Chinese nation but also sympathized with and helped the liberation struggles of other oppressed nations in Asia. Ding Zeliang listed many historical facts, analyzing that Sun Yat-sen, on the one hand, absorbed experiences and lessons from the liberation struggles of various Asian nations and was inspired by them; on the other hand, he greatly influenced the Asian national liberation struggle with his constantly developing revolutionary theory. Ding Zeliang said that Sun Yat-sen was a great democratic revolutionist who continuously progressed throughout his revolutionary activities. Around the time of World War I and the October Revolution, Sun Yat-sen changed his views on the Asian revolution and pointed out the direction of the Asian national liberation struggle.

Zhou Binglin, Huang Tianlin, Rong Mengyuan, Liu Danian, and others spoke at the meeting. They discussed the above three reports and put forward many opinions.

In addition to scientists and teachers from the philosophical and historical circles of the capital and universities, representatives from Northeast People's University, Northeast Normal University, and Shandong Normal College, totaling about 200 people, participated in the symposium. Tao Menghe, Vice President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Huang Songling, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Higher Education, and Shao Lizi, a member of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, also attended the symposium.

    纪念孙中山先生诞辰九十周年
    首都学术界举行学术讨论会
    新华社15日讯　首都学术界在15日举行纪念孙中山先生诞辰九十周年学术讨论会。
    在讨论会上，由侯外庐、丁则良、黎澍分别就孙中山的哲学思想以及同政治思想的关系、孙中山和亚洲民族解放斗争、孙中山革命活动的社会基础等专题作了报告。
    侯外庐在“孙中山哲学思想及其政治思想的关系”的报告中，首先分析了孙中山是处在革命大风暴的时代中，这时正是新的因素不断增长壮大，旧的东西逐渐衰颓没落的时代。这种复杂矛盾的时代面影就不能不反映在孙中山的哲学思想和政治思想之中。侯外庐说，我们研究孙中山先生的思想，正是要根据他所处的这个特定的历史条件，有分析批判地吸收其有价值的成果。
    侯外庐就孙中山的世界观、认识论、真理论等三个方面分析了他的哲学思想。指出孙中山的哲学思想虽然是不完整的、逐渐成熟的、但是紧紧地接近于唯物主义的。虽然也有唯心主义的成份，但是在其思想体系中，是很次要的。侯外庐依据许多事实证明孙中山哲学思想在这三方面的贡献。孙中山的世界观上所具有的唯物主义因素，成为他在政治上进步的理论基础。
    丁则良报告了“孙中山与亚洲民族解放斗争”。他举出了在1899年菲律宾所爆发的抗美战争，说明孙中山不仅把他一生贡献给中华民族的解放斗争，同时也同情并帮助在亚洲的其它被压迫民族的解放斗争。丁则良列举了许多历史事实，分析了孙中山一方面从亚洲各民族的解放斗争中吸收了经验教训，并从中得到鼓舞；另方面，又以他不断发展着的革命理论对亚洲的民族解放斗争起了巨大的影响。丁则良说，孙中山是一个伟大的民主主义革命家，在他一生的革命活动中，不断地进步。在第一次世界大战和十月革命前后，孙中山改变了他对亚洲革命的看法，同时并指出了亚洲民族解放斗争的方向。
    在会上发言的有周炳琳、黄天琳、荣孟源、刘大年等人。他们分别就上面三个报告进行了讨论，并提出了许多意见。
    参加这次学术讨论会的，除首都哲学和历史学界的科学工作者和首都高等学校中的教师外，还有东北人民大学、东北师范大学和山东师范学院的代表共约二百人。中国科学院副院长陶孟和、高等教育部副部长黄松龄、中国国民党革命委员会委员邵力子也出席了这个讨论会。
