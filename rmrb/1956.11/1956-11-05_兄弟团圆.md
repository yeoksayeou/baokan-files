Brothers Reunited
Shen Jian

This summer vacation, I went to the South to see my brother, whom I had never met, with excited but also bittersweet and complex emotions. I only recently learned about my background and my original family.

Daijia Village, this is my real hometown, what a beautiful place! In front of the village are layers of mountains, a winding stream on the left, and a large area of rice fields with yellow and green borders on the right. The villagers are busy harvesting rice and transplanting seedlings.

I asked an old man at the entrance of the village: "Old man, where does Genyuan live? Is he at home?"

"Comrade, where are you from? What do you want him for?"

"I am his younger brother, and I came from Beijing to see him."

"You, you..." He looked at me in surprise and froze.

"Old man, my milk name is Gencai, and I was sold to a landlord in the upper village as a son when I was young."

The old man's expression became amiable and kind, pointing and saying: "Your brother is harvesting rice in the field, and your sister-in-law is at home." Then he took me a few steps to the door of a house, stopped, and shouted: "Axiang, your little uncle is here."

A young rural woman ran out of the house holding a chubby baby. She hesitated for a moment and greeted me: "Oh, is this my brother? You've finally come!" As soon as she entered the house, she put the baby on the bamboo bed and hurried to get water for me to wash my face, lit a fire to make tea, and asked someone to call my brother back from the field. At this time, the neighbors came to see me, and the children opened their eyes wide, so strange: "How did a strange uncle fall from the sky today?"

My brother's house was allocated during the land reform. It looks a bit old on the outside, but it has been repaired inside and looks very decent. The stairs and wallboards were recently installed. A new wooden square table is placed in the center of the hall, with a new teapot and a copy of the third volume of "Farmer's Reader" on the table. A white shirt hangs on the left wall, with a pen in the pocket. An agricultural production increase award certificate hangs in the center of the wall. My brother is a model worker! Why didn't he mention it in his letter?

A dark, sturdy peasant rushed into the house, panting. "Brother, you're here!" "Brother!" We held hands tightly, not letting go for a long time, our eyes filled with tears.

Then a man carrying a load of grain came in. He shook my hand, and my brother introduced him as the director of the agricultural cooperative. The director said: "Congratulations on your brothers' reunion. Genyuan, the Communist Party liberated you and brought you your younger brother today. Go take a shower, put on some new clothes, and have a good time with your brother for a few days." As he left, he invited me to visit his house.

My sister-in-law brought a large bowl of white sugar egg tea, sweet and hot, and insisted that I eat it all in one go. Before I finished eating, she brought another large plate of fried peanuts. My brother specially killed a chicken for me. My sister-in-law kept putting large pieces of chicken into my bowl.

In the evening, my brother and I slept in the same bed. My brother talked to me about many things. The tragic scenes of the past unfolded before my eyes one by one.

In 1933, there was a severe drought. The fields were so dry that they cracked open, and the crops turned into dry thatch. My family's situation was similar to that of thousands of Chinese peasant families who were waiting to die at that time. My father, the main labor force in the family, fell ill, my elderly grandfather was like a candle in the wind, and three children were crying for food. Helpless, I was sold to a landlord surnamed Wu thirty miles away for seven silver dollars to be his son; my four-month-old sister could not be sold, and in the middle of the night, she was placed in a basket and hung on the gate of another landlord's house; my brother was a little older, so he went to herd cattle for the landlord; my mother went out to work as a servant.

Selling sons and abandoning daughters, were parents really heartless? What could they do? If they stayed with them, they would inevitably starve to death! My grandfather and father died one after another in poverty and illness, my mother went blind in a sea of tears, and finally wandered and begged for food and starved to death in the wilderness...

I stopped sobbing and became stronger. This cursed, man-eating society has been overthrown by us, and the tragedy of deep suffering will not be repeated. Dear parents, may your spirits in heaven rest in peace! Now your sons have grown strong and stand tall, living happily. The eldest is a member of the Youth League, a member of the agricultural cooperative, and has already started a family. The second son is no longer the "son of a landlord class." He grew up under the care and education of the Party, joined the Communist Party of China, and has just graduated from the Foreign Languages ​​Institute and is about to embark on a new job to build a new China. Your sons will always be loyal to the people and fight to the end for the beautiful life of mankind! (Attached picture)

    兄弟团圆
    申健
    今年暑假，我怀着兴奋的但是又喜又悲的复杂情绪，到南方去看我那从没有见过面的亲哥哥。我是不久以前才知道自己的身世和原来的家的。
    戴家村，这便是我真正的故乡，多么美丽的地方呵！村前重重山岭，左边一条蜿蜒曲折的小溪，右边一大片黄绿镶边的稻田。老乡们正忙着割稻又插秧。
    我在村口问一位老大爷：“老大爷，根源住在哪里？他在家吗？”
    “同志，你从哪来？找他啥事情？”
    “我是他的弟弟，特地从北京来看他。”
    “你，你……”他惊奇地打量着我，楞住了。
    “老大爷，我奶名叫根才，从小卖给了上村一个地主做儿子。”
    老大爷的神色变得和蔼可亲起来，指点着说：“你哥在地里割稻，你嫂在家里。”说着他就带我走了几步，到一个房子门口停住，喊道：“阿香娘子，你小叔来了。”
    一个年青的农村妇女抱着一个胖娃娃从屋里跑出来。她迟疑了一回，招呼我：“噢，是弟弟吗？你可来了！”一进屋，她把娃娃在竹床上一放，就忙着给我打水洗脸，点火烧茶，还托人去地里叫我哥哥回来。这时邻居都来看我，小孩子们一个个睁大着眼，好奇怪啊：“今天怎么从天上掉下来一个陌生的叔叔？”
    哥哥的房子是在土改中分来的，外表旧了一点，可是里面经过修理已很像样了。楼梯，板壁是新近安上的。一张新的木方桌放在堂前正中，桌上放着一把新茶壶，一本第三册农民读本。左边壁上挂着一件白衬衣，口袋上插着一枝钢笔。壁的正中挂着一张农业增产奖状。哥哥原来是模范！为什么他在信里只字不提呢？
    一个粗黑结实的农民气喘喘地撞进屋来。“弟弟，你来了！”“哥！”我们两个紧握着手，久久不放，眼眶里满是泪水。
    接着进来一个挑着一担谷子的人，他握了握我的手，哥哥介绍说他是农业社社长。社长说：“祝贺你们兄弟团圆。根源，共产党解放了你，今天又给你送来了弟弟。快去洗个澡，换上件新衣服，好好跟你弟弟玩上几天。”临走时，他叫我到他家去玩。
    嫂嫂端来一大碗白糖鸡子茶，又甜又热，一定要我一口气吃下去。没等我吃完，她又送上来一大盆炒花生。哥哥特地为我杀了一只鸡。嫂嫂尽挑大块的鸡肉往我碗里塞。
    晚上，哥哥和我睡在一张床上。哥哥同我谈了许多事情。过去的悲惨情景一幕一幕地展现在我的眼前。
    1933年闹大旱，田晒得张开了口，庄稼变成了干茅草，一根火柴可以点着一大片。我家光景同那时旧中国千千万万坐以待毙的农家相仿。家中主要劳动力的父亲病倒了，年迈的祖父已像风前残烛，三个孩子嗷嗷待哺。没奈何，七块白洋，把我卖给了三十里外一个姓吴的地主做儿子；四个月的妹妹卖不出去，深更半夜被放在一只篮里挂在另一家地主的大门上；哥哥稍稍大些，去给地主放牛；妈妈出外帮佣。
    卖儿弃女，这难道是父母狠心吗？有什么法子呢，留在身边反而免不了饿死啊！祖父、父亲相继在贫病交迫中死去了，母亲在泪海中淹瞎了眼睛，最后流浪讨饭饿死在荒野。……
    我停止了抽咽，坚强起来。这可诅咒的吃人的社会已被我们推翻，那深重苦难的悲剧已不会重演。亲爱的爸妈，你们在天之灵安息吧！如今你们的儿子都已强壮地站立了起来，生活得很幸福。老大是青年团员、农业社社员，并且已经成家立业。老二早已不再是“地主阶级的儿子”，他在党的抚养教育下成长，加入了中国共产党，现在刚从外国语学院毕业，即将走上建设新中国的岗位。你们的儿子们将永远忠实于人民，为人类的美好生活奋斗到底！（附图片）
