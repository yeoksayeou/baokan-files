Xinhua News Agency, Karachi, November 3rd: Prime Minister Suhrawardy told demonstrating masses in Karachi on November 2nd who were protesting against Anglo-French aggression in Egypt: "If the United Kingdom and France refuse to accept the United Nations' ruling, other countries in the world have every right to unite and use force against the aggressors, until the law once again prevails in the world and countries are willing to sit around the table and resolve their disputes peacefully."

The mighty demonstration, carrying placards opposing Anglo-French aggression and supporting Egypt, started from Mia Weidel Tower, paraded through major streets, and arrived in front of the Prime Minister's residence. This march was organized by the People's Alliance in cooperation with many other political groups, trade unions, and student organizations.

Suhrawardy told the demonstrating masses that Pakistan has always supported the principle of resolving international disputes through peaceful means. He expressed regret that Britain and France, as important member states of the United Nations, have disregarded the principles of the United Nations.

He said that his government has maintained this principle from the beginning: no country should use force against any other country to resolve any problem.

He said that Pakistan is studying the situation and will not hesitate to provide all possible assistance to Egypt.

    卡拉奇群众示威反对英法侵略埃及
    巴基斯坦总理宣布将援助埃及
    并说英法如不接受联合国裁决各国可予武力制裁
    据新华社卡拉奇3日电　苏拉瓦底总理11月2日对卡拉奇反对英法侵略埃及的示威群众说：“如果联合王国和法国拒绝接受联合国的裁决的话，世界上其他国家就完全有权联合起来对侵略者使用武力，直到法律再度在世界上占优势和各国愿意围着桌子坐下来和平地解决它们的争端的时候为止。”
    浩浩荡荡的带着反对英法侵略和支持埃及的标语牌的示威群众，从米阿威得尔塔出发，经过各大街道游行到总理官邸的前面。这次游行是人民联盟同其他许多政治团体、工会和学生团体合作组织的。
    苏拉瓦底对示威群众说，巴基斯坦始终支持以和平手段解决国际争端的原则。他对于英法这两个联合国的重要会员国竟然蔑视联合国的原则表示遗憾。
    他说，他的政府从一开始就维护这种原则：没有一个国家应该对任何其他国家使用武力来解决任何问题。
    他说，巴基斯坦正在研究情况，并且在向埃及提供一切可能的援助这件事上将不会迟疑不决。
