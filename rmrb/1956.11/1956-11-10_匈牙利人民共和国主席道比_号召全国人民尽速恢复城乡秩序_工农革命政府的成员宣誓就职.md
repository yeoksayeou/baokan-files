Xinhua News Agency, November 9th, Budapest Dispatch: According to TASS, the members of the Hungarian Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Government headed by János Kádár were sworn in on November 8th before István Dobi, Chairman of the Presidium of the Hungarian People's Republic.

István Dobi, Chairman of the Presidium of the Hungarian People's Republic, and State Minister Marosán delivered radio addresses on Budapest Radio. They called on the people of the whole country to struggle for the speedy restoration of tranquility and order in urban and rural areas, and explained the significance and rights of the revolutionary committees and worker committees established by the working people.

On the same day, the Hungarian Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Government promulgated several important orders. A Public Supply Committee was established in Budapest. The government will send a special commissioner to lead railway transportation work.

One of the leaders of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, Apro, called on miners through the radio to rectify coal mining work.

Life in the provinces is gradually returning to normal. In Szabolcs-Szatmár-Bereg County, most factories have resumed operation, and farmers have begun autumn field work. Railways and public transportation in the eastern region have begun to operate. Life in cities such as Szeged, Szombathely, and Nyíregyháza is becoming increasingly normal.

When Hungarian workers and peasants learned that the Soviet Union, China, Czechoslovakia, Romania, and other socialist countries had decided to provide Hungary with economic assistance, they were very happy. Coal, metals, grain, and medicines from the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia are continuously being transported to Hungary.

Now, Hungarian patriots are increasingly actively helping the government suppress reactionary forces.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, November 9th: Czechoslovak News Agency, based on Budapest Radio broadcasts reporting on the restoration of order in various parts of Hungary, stated that life in Szeged, a city in southern Hungary, has returned to normal, city traffic is smooth, and shops are open for business. The organization of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party is gradually being established here, and some old and tested fighters and workers have joined the party's leadership.

Life in Győr in the west has also returned to normal. Shops have begun to open, and schools resumed classes on the 6th. Most of the workers in the locomotive factory and the Wilhelm Pieck Machinery Factory have returned to work. City buses and several long-distance bus routes have resumed operation. The main staff of various state institutions have generally returned to their posts, which has greatly contributed to the restoration of order here. The people who long for peaceful work have expressed their confidence in the Hungarian Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Government.

The remnants of counter-revolutionaries in various places are being eliminated. Groups of criminals who escaped from prison and hid in the forests near Komló have been surrounded. In Komarno, all the surrounded counter-revolutionary bandits have surrendered their weapons. However, in the west, some counter-revolutionaries have fled to the Austrian border.

The town of Székesfehérvár has eliminated counter-revolutionary terror. Shops and markets are open, and goods are supplied by local producers, merchants, and farmers in the suburbs. Bakeries are working at full capacity. Workers have begun to resume work in factories. Work in the fields has also begun.

The Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party's organ, "Free People's Daily," published an editorial on the 7th to celebrate the 39th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution. The newspaper wrote, "For the working people, there is no country closer than the Soviet Union, born of the victory of the proletariat." The newspaper called for a struggle against speeches that undermine the friendship between the Hungarian and Soviet peoples.
