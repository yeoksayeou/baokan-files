Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, November 15th: The basic construction departments in the Wuhan area are stepping up preparations for winter construction, and some cold-resistant and heat-preserving equipment and materials have begun to be transported to construction sites.

Having learned from the past lessons of winter construction being affected by insufficient preparation, the Central South Engineering Management Bureau convened a meeting of heads of engineering companies as early as the beginning of October to arrange and deploy this year's winter construction preparation work. Subsequently, a group of technicians was dispatched to various companies to inspect and guide related work. Now, the companies have successively formulated technical plans for winter construction and are taking measures to implement them. The First and Second Engineering Companies are both stepping up the renovation and reinforcement of offices, dormitories, work sheds, and on-site bathrooms to prevent wind and snow. Both companies have also prepared stoves and coal, and other thermal insulation equipment and materials. The trade union of the Second Engineering Company is preparing to provide special subsidies to help some employees with financial difficulties solve the problem of winter clothing.

The bridge engineering offices under the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge Engineering Bureau have also carried out a lot of work in preparing for winter construction. The First Bridge Engineering Office, which is responsible for work on the Hanyang bank alone, has prepared 140 heating stoves and purchased more than 20,000 kilograms of rice straw and more than 800 straw mats from the suburbs. In addition, this engineering office is building drying rooms to ensure that workers can wear dry clothes during snowy seasons.

At the construction sites of the Wuhan Iron and Steel United Enterprise and the levee projects, cold-resistance and insulation work is also being stepped up.

    接受往年准备不及时影响施工的教训
    武汉地区提早准备冬季施工
    新华社武汉15日电　武汉地区的基本建设部门正在加紧准备冬季施工，部分抗寒保温的器材和设备开始运到工地。
    接受了往年因为冬季施工准备工作不及时而使施工受到影响的教训，中南工程管理总局早在10月初就召集工程公司负责人开会，对今年冬季施工准备工作进行了安排和部署。接着，又派出一批技术人员到各公司检查和指导有关工作。现在，各公司已经先后订出冬季施工的技术方案，并且正在采取措施加以贯彻。第一和第二工程公司都在加紧对办公室、宿舍、工棚和工地洗澡间进行整修和加固，以防风雪侵袭。两个公司都还准备了火炉和煤炭等保温器材、设备。第二工程公司工会为了帮助部分有生活困难的职工解决寒衣问题，准备进行一次专门补助。
    武汉长江大桥工程局所属各桥梁工程处在冬季施工准备方面，也进行了许多工作。仅在汉阳岸担任工作的第一桥梁工程处就准备好了一百四十个取暖用的火炉，还从郊区购来两万多斤稻草和八百多张草垫。此外，这个工程处正在修建烘衣间，以保证工人在大雪季节里能够穿上干衣。
    在武汉钢铁联合企业和堤防工程工地，抗寒保温工作也都在加紧进行中。
