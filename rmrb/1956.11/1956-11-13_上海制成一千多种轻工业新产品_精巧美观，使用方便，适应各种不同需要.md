Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, November 12th: The factories under the Shanghai Second Bureau of Light Industry have manufactured over a thousand new and newly styled products this year.

　　These new products have been trial-manufactured by fifteen industries, including medicine, medical equipment, tires and rubber shoes, rubber miscellaneous parts, clocks and watches, glass, aluminum ware, enamelware, thermos bottles, and daily-use chemicals. Among the many new products trial-manufactured by the pharmaceutical and medical equipment industries are "Isonicotinylaldehyde Sodium Sulfoxylate," which has a better therapeutic effect on tuberculosis than Remifon and Isoniazid, the technically demanding oral penicillin "V," and a fundus camera that can clearly photograph the internal structures of the patient's eyes, and so on. The enamelware and thermos bottle industries have begun to pay attention to designing new patterns this year. The rubber industry has produced various lightweight and beautiful women's rubber-soled sandals. The glass industry has restored high-end glassware with colored overlays, which was made one or two decades ago: sapphire blue vases and fruit plates, etc.

　　Many new products have been trial-manufactured with great attention to ease of use. There is a new women's umbrella that can be folded up when not in use and placed in a handbag. There is a kind of lightweight rubber overshoe that can be worn over leather shoes when it rains and folded up and put in a raincoat pocket when the weather is clear. People who need to get up on time can buy a new alarm clock. The alarm clock's ringtone starts gently, and if people have not yet been awakened, it will ring loudly and urgently.

　　Many new products have been trial-manufactured to meet the needs of various people. For example, hard-toed work boots for miners can protect the miner's toes from being injured by rocks and coal blocks during mining. The daily-use chemical industry has also trial-manufactured high-end toothpastes such as Dunhuang, Wanli, and Wintergreen Chlorophyll for people with higher living standards.

　　Shanghai has also trial-manufactured daily necessities for domestic ethnic minorities this year, such as stewing pots for mutton and beef, butter churns for butter, and pilaf plates.

    上海制成一千多种轻工业新产品
    精巧美观，使用方便，适应各种不同需要
    新华社上海12日电　上海市第二轻工业局所属各工厂今年制成的新品种和新样式的产品，已经有一千多种。
    这些新的产品是由医药、医疗器械、轮胎胶鞋、橡胶杂件、钟表、玻璃、铝器、搪瓷、热水瓶、日用化学等十五个行业试制出来的。制药和医疗器械工业试制的许多新产品中，有治疗肺结核的疗效比雷米风和异烟腙更好的“异烟醘肼次甲磺酵钠”、技术要求很高的供口服用的青霉素“V”、可以清楚地拍摄出患者眼睛内部结构的眼底摄影机等等。搪瓷和热水瓶工业今年开始注意设计一些新的图案。橡胶工业制成了各种轻巧美观的女式胶底凉鞋。玻璃工业恢复了一、二十年前做过的套色车料的高级玻璃器皿：宝蓝色的花瓶和水果盘等。
    许多新的产品的试制都十分注意使用的方便。有一种女用新伞，在不使用的时候可以把伞骨、伞布折叠起来，放在手提包里。有种轻巧的橡皮套鞋，下雨的时候可以套在皮鞋的外面，天晴了就可以折起来放在雨衣口袋里。必须按时起床的人可以买到一种新闹钟。这种闹钟的铃声，开始的时候比较缓和，如果人们还没有被叫醒，它就大声急促的响下去。
    有许多新的产品是适应各种不同需要的人而试制的。如供矿工穿的硬头工作靴，可以保护矿工的脚趾在采矿的时候不会被石块煤块碰伤。日用化学工业还试制了供给生活水平较高的人使用的敦煌、万里、冬青叶绿素等高级牙膏。
    上海今年还为国内少数民族试制了闷牛羊肉用的闷锅、装酥油用的酥油壶、抓饭盘等日用品。
