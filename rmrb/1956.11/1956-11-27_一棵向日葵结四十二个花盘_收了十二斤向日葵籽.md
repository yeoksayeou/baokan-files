    One Sunflower Bears Forty-Two Flower Heads, Yielding Twelve Jin of Sunflower Seeds
    This newspaper reports: In the Dahongpo Agricultural Cooperative, an Yi ethnic autonomous region in Mile County, Yunnan Province, a sunflower grew forty-two flower heads and yielded twelve jin of sunflower seeds this year. This sunflower was discovered by Zhang Taishun, the director of the cooperative, at the edge of his field. This field was not planted with sunflowers this year, and it is possible that the seed had fallen into the ground last year.
    Because this sunflower grew in a small ditch at the edge of the field, the soil was fertile, and it grew very robustly. By the time it matured, the main stem was nine chi tall and three cun in diameter; the side branches were also one chi two cun to one chi six cun long, with the larger ones being one cun in diameter. The flower head on top of the main stem was about one chi in diameter, and the others were around six or seven cun, with the four smallest ones at the bottom being three cun in diameter. Its leaves, flower seeds, and maturity period were the same as ordinary sunflowers.
    Local cadres and the masses have preserved the sunflower's seeds and plan to try planting them next year. (Cai Rongcheng)

    一棵向日葵结四十二个花盘
    收了十二斤向日葵籽
    本报讯　云南省弥勒县彝族自治区大红坡农业社今年有一棵向日葵结了四十二个花盘，收了十二斤向日葵籽。这棵向日葵是在社主任张太顺的地边发现的，这块地今年没有种向日葵，可能是去年落在地里的种子长成的。
    这棵向日葵因为是长在地边的小沟里，土壤肥沃，一长出来就很茁壮。到成熟时，主干有九尺高，直径三寸；支干也有一尺二寸到一尺六寸长，大的直径有一寸。主干顶上的花盘，直径约一尺，别的都在六、七寸左右，最下面的四小盘，直径也有三寸。它的叶子、花籽和成熟期等都和普通向日葵一样。
    当地干部和群众已经把这棵向日葵的花籽保留下来，准备明年试种。　（蔡荣成）
