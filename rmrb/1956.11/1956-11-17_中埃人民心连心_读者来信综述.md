The Hearts of the Chinese and Egyptian People are Linked Together
—A Summary of Readers' Letters—
The Editorial Department of this Newspaper

Since the British and French imperialists launched a war of aggression against Egypt, this newspaper has received a large number of letters and telegrams from the Chinese people protesting against the aggressive actions of Britain and France and supporting the just struggle of the Egyptian people. As of November 13th, this newspaper had received more than 3,500 such letters and telegrams. The letters and telegrams came from people of all ethnic groups, social strata, and professions in China, from the capital to the border areas, from Heilongjiang to the Pearl River, from the Mongolian grasslands to the Kangzang Plateau, including workers, farmers, students, professors, teachers, active servicemen, demobilized soldiers, actors, artists, writers, government cadres, cooperative members, medical personnel, tractor drivers, religious figures, industrialists and businessmen... Many letters and telegrams were sent in the name of all the personnel of a factory or enterprise, an institution, or a school. Everyone expressed extreme indignation and strong protest against the aggressive actions of Britain and France, and expressed deep sympathy and full support for the Egyptian people. Among these letters and telegrams, some were to be forwarded to the Egyptian government and people through this newspaper, and we have forwarded them all to the Embassy of the Arab Republic of Egypt in China; some were protest letters to the British and French governments, and we have forwarded them all to the British Chargé d'Affaires in China. At the same time, many readers have also sent funds to support the Egyptian people, and we have transferred them to the Egyptian Embassy in China in full.

Many readers pointed out in their letters and telegrams that the British and French imperialists' aggression against Egypt is not only a barbarous attack on the Egyptian people, but also a shameless provocation against the countries and peoples in Asia and Africa who are striving for national independence and opposing colonialism. The Chinese people love peace, and it is precisely for the sake of peace that we must resolutely support the Egyptian people's struggle against aggression. All the students of Class 6 of the First Grade of the Prospecting Engineering Department of Beijing Institute of Geology said in their letter: "We appreciate the happiness of living in freedom... but we can only make our lives happier in peaceful days. Therefore, we resolutely oppose the British and French imperialists' behavior of destroying peace in the Middle East and aggression against Egypt."

Readers demonstrated a great spirit of internationalism in their letters and telegrams. They pointed out that the Chinese people have suffered from long-term colonial aggression and oppression, and therefore, our hearts are closely linked with the hearts of the Egyptian people. The Chinese people regard the Egyptian people's struggle as their own struggle. Lin Fouchi and Huang Xianglan and other 30 mothers from Dongfanghong Agricultural Cooperative in Jinshan District, Wenchang County, Hainan Island, wrote: "We mothers and children on Hainan Island have tasted enough of the scourge of Japanese imperialism, and we resolutely oppose wars of aggression; our hearts are the hearts of mothers loving their children, and the hearts of safeguarding peace." Chinese Christians issued a righteous appeal. Zhao Zichen, a research professor at Yanjing Union Theological Seminary, wrote in an appeal: "Christians cannot tolerate this barbaric act of aggression by Britain and France, and cannot sit idly by while they commit lawless and inhumane atrocities. We Christians have a responsibility to demand that Britain and France immediately withdraw their invading troops from Egyptian territory."

Many readers warned the British and French imperialists that they must remember the meaning of the Chinese proverb "He who plays with fire will perish by it." If they do not stop their aggression and withdraw their troops from Egyptian territory, they will face even more serious consequences than they do now.

Readers expressed their willingness to support the Egyptian people with practical actions. They expressed their determination to do their best in their respective posts. Jiang Fengzhang and Bozonggui of Wuli Coal Mine on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau telegraphed, "We must work hard in this cold Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, regardless of all difficulties, to support the Egyptian people's struggle against aggression." They also expressed their willingness to join the volunteer army and go to Egypt when necessary. Many medical personnel and technicians have expressed their willingness to contribute their efforts to support the Egyptian people in resisting aggression and defending peace. Pan Qiying, Pang Xuanwen, and 25 other doctors from Peking Union Medical College wrote, "If the Egyptian people need it, we are willing to organize a volunteer medical team to support the Egyptian people." Many readers donated the money they had saved by scrimping and saving to support the Egyptian people. Huang Hui, a revolutionary disabled soldier from Zhejiang, donated the 100 yuan he had planned to use for his wedding. Some students sent the money they had planned to use to buy new cotton clothes to the Egyptian people. Shi Xiaomei, a child from Beijing, and her younger brother and sister sent one yuan of candy money given to them by their parents to this newspaper, hoping to buy a few bullets and send them to the Egyptian people "so that they can kill those bullying robbers."

Readers unanimously believe that the Egyptian people's just struggle will surely be victorious. They pointed out that no matter how ferocious the British and French imperialists are, they are very isolated and facing increasing difficulties. As long as Egypt persists in its struggle, then with the increasingly powerful support of peace forces around the world, final victory belongs to the Egyptian people. The Chinese people will use all their strength to give the Egyptian people resolute support.

    中埃人民心连心
    ——读者来信综述——
    本报编辑部
    自从英、法帝国主义对埃及发动侵略战争以来，本报收到了我国人民抗议英、法侵略行为和支援埃及人民正义斗争的大量的来信和来电。截至11月13日止，本报共收到这样的来信和来电三千五百多封。来信和来电报的包括从首都到边疆、从黑龙江到珠江、从蒙古草原到康藏高原的我国各民族、各阶层、各行各业的人，其中有工人、农民、学生、教授、教员、现役军人、转业军人、演员、艺术家、作家、机关干部、合作社社员、医务人员、拖拉机手、宗教界人士、工商业者……。有许多信和电报是以一个工厂或企业、一个机关或一个学校的全体人员的名义发来的。大家对于英、法的侵略行为表示了极度的愤慨和强烈的抗议，对于埃及人民表示了深切的同情和全力支持。在这些来信和来电中，一部分是要本报转交埃及政府和人民的，我们都已转给了埃及共和国驻华大使馆；有一部分是给英国和法国政府的抗议信，我们都已转交给了英国驻中国的代办处。同时，许多读者还寄来了款项以支持埃及人民，我们已如数转交给了埃及驻华大使馆。
    许多读者在来信和来电中指出，英、法帝国主义侵略埃及不仅是对埃及人民的野蛮进攻，同时也是对亚非两洲争取民族独立、反对殖民主义的国家和人民的无耻挑衅。中国人民是热爱和平的，而正是为了和平，必须坚决支持埃及人民的反侵略斗争。北京地质学院探矿工程系一年级六班全体同学在来信中说：“我们体会到生活在自由中的幸福……但只有在和平的日子里我们才能使生活愈来愈幸福。因此，我们坚决反对英法帝国主义在中东破坏和平和侵略埃及的行为。”
    读者们在来信和来电中表现了伟大的国际主义精神。他们指出，中国人民曾经受过长期的殖民侵略和压迫，因此，我们的心是同埃及人民的心紧紧连在一起的。中国人民把埃及人民的斗争看成是自己的斗争。海南岛文昌县锦山区东方红农业社林妚次、黄香兰等三十位母亲来信说：“我们海南岛的母亲和孩子尝够了日本帝国主义的祸害，我们坚决反对侵略战争；我们的心是母亲爱护孩子的心，是维护和平的心。”中国基督教徒发出了正义的呼吁。燕京协和神学院研究教授赵紫宸在一封呼吁书上写道：“基督教徒不能容忍英国和法国的这种野蛮的侵略行为，不能坐视它们的无法无天、灭绝人性的暴行。我们基督教徒有责任要求英、法立即将侵略军队撤出埃及领土。”
    许多读者警告英、法帝国主义者：必须记住“玩火自焚”这句中国名谚的道理。如果他们不停止侵略，把军队撤出埃及领土，他们将会面临比现在更严重的后果。
    读者们表示要以实际行动来支援埃及人民。他们表示要努力做好本岗位的工作，青藏高原上的乌丽煤矿的蒋凤璋、渤中贵打电报来说，“我们一定要在这寒冷的青藏高原上，不怕一切艰难困苦，搞好自己的工作，来支援埃及人民的反侵略斗争。”他们并且表示，在必要的时候，愿意参加志愿军到埃及去。许多医务人员、技术人员都表示愿意贡献自己的力量去支援埃及人民，以反抗侵略、保卫和平。中国协和医学院医师潘其英、庞宣文等二十五人来信说，“如果埃及人民需要，我们愿意组织志愿医疗队去支援埃及人民。”有许多读者捐献了他们节衣缩食积聚下来的钱，支援埃及人民。浙江革命残废军人黄辉把他计划用于结婚的一百元人民币捐献了出来。有的学生把计划买新棉衣的钱送给埃及人民。北京市的儿童石小梅和她的弟弟、妹妹把爸爸妈妈给她们的一元糖果钱寄来本报，希望买几颗子弹，送给埃及人民，“让他们打死那些欺负人的强盗。”
    读者们一致认为，埃及人民的正义斗争是一定会取得胜利的。他们指出，尽管英、法帝国主义多么穷凶极恶，但是它们是十分孤立的，而且困难越来越大。只要埃及坚持斗争，那末在全世界和平力量越来越有力的支援下，最后胜利是属于埃及人民的。中国人民将用一切力量，给埃及人民以坚决的支持。
