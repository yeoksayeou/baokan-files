    In memory of the ninetieth anniversary of the birth of Mr. Sun Yat-sen, four seven-character quatrains
    Li Jishen
    (I)
    Remembering the former sages of the National Revolution,
    Forty years of arduous struggle and strain,
    China's desire for freedom and equality,
    Should now bring solace to his honored remains.
    (II)
    The wheels of history never cease to advance,
    Later generations surpass what the master could enhance,
    Humility even after success is key,
    Recalling the former sages, may our aspirations coalesce, we chance.
    (III)
    Anti-feudal and anti-imperial, a path he did pave,
    Distinguishing friend from foe, clarity we must save,
    A word to those who secretly admire the late sage,
    Do not betray his life's cause due to impulsive rage.
    (IV)
    Sticking to old ways leads to a dead end,
    His last words were to serve the public good, to transcend,
    Only seeking national prosperity, peace, and joy,
    Let us not haggle over factions and clannish ploy.

    纪念孙中山先生九十周年诞辰感怀七绝四首
    李济深
    （一）
    国民革命缅前贤，
    奋斗艰难四十年，
    中国自由平等愿，
    至今应可慰重泉。
    （二）
    历史车轮进不停，
    后生事业过先生，
    虚心更是成功后，
    追念前贤愿共鸣。
    （三）
    反封反帝有先程，
    敌我应该认识清，
    寄语先生私淑辈，
    勿因意气负生平。
    （四）故步自封道不通，
    遗言天下在为公，
    只求国泰民安乐，
    莫事斤斤论派宗。
