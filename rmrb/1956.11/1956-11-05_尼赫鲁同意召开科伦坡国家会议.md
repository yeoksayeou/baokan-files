Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, November 4th. According to a press communique released by the Indian Information Bureau on the evening of November 3rd, Prime Minister Nehru has accepted the proposal for a meeting of the Prime Ministers of the Colombo Powers to discuss the situation in Egypt. This proposal was recently put forward by Indonesian Prime Minister Sastroamidjojo.

In a telegram to the Indonesian Prime Minister, Nehru said that due to the UNESCO conference and the visit of several foreign dignitaries, it would be difficult for him to leave New Delhi at present. He suggested that it might be convenient for the Prime Ministers of other Colombo Powers if the meeting were held in New Delhi.

    尼赫鲁同意召开科伦坡国家会议
    新华社新德里4日电　据印度新闻局11月3日晚上发布的新闻公报说，尼赫鲁总理已经接受了关于科伦坡国家的总理举行会议讨论埃及局势的建议。这个建议是印度尼西亚总理沙斯特罗阿米佐约最近提出的。
    尼赫鲁在给印度尼西亚总理的电报中说，由于联合国教育、科学及文化组织的会议以及一些外国贵宾的来访，他目前很难离开新德里。他建议，如果会议在新德里举行的话，对于其他科伦坡国家的总理可能会是方便的。
    同样的通知已经送交锡兰、缅甸和巴基斯坦总理。
