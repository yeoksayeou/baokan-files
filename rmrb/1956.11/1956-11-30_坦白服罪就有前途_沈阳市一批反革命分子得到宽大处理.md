Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 27th: A number of remaining counter-revolutionaries in Shenyang City who had thoroughly confessed their counter-revolutionary crimes have received lenient treatment from the government, and many have found employment.

Over the past year, the Shenyang Public Security organs have adopted a responsible attitude towards counter-revolutionaries who voluntarily confessed, actively conducted investigations and verification, and, based on the degree of their confession, reported to the judicial organs for approval and promptly granted lenient treatment. Those who showed good behavior during the period of supervision by admitting their guilt, submitting to control, actively engaging in labor production, or reporting accomplices with meritorious service, had their supervision revoked ahead of schedule.

Counter-revolutionaries who have confessed their crimes and received lenient treatment have expressed immense gratitude to the government. Zhang Jingxiu, a counter-revolutionary with serious crimes residing in the Dadong District, was given lenient treatment with three years of supervision after voluntarily confessing. Zhang Jingxiu was very happy and took the initiative to write a letter of determination, stating that he would abide by national laws, work hard, and strive to become a new person.

The remaining counter-revolutionaries who have received lenient treatment in Shenyang City have been guaranteed their livelihoods, and some have also participated in work. Cao Jieyi, who was under supervision, performed well during his supervision period. He has now had his supervision revoked and has been appointed as a technician at the Twelfth Chemical Production Cooperative. He has worked diligently and has successfully researched several drugs, for which he has received awards.

    坦白服罪就有前途
    沈阳市一批反革命分子得到宽大处理
    据新华社沈阳27日电　沈阳市的一些已经彻底坦白了反革命罪行的残余反革命分子，得到了政府的宽大处理，许多人已经有了职业。
    一年来，沈阳市公安机关对自动坦白的反革命分子，采取了认真负责的态度，积极进行调查对证，并根据他们坦白程度，报请司法机关批准，及时给予了宽大处理。对于在管制期间认罪服管、积极从事劳动生产或检举同案犯有立功表现的，都提前撤销了管制。
    已经坦白了罪行并得到宽大处理的反革命分子，对政府都表示无比的感激。住在大东区的有严重罪行的反革命分子张静修，在自动坦白后，政府给以管制三年的宽大处理。张静修很高兴，主动写了决心书，表示今后要遵守国家法令，努力劳动，争取重新作人。
    残余反革命分子，在沈阳市受到宽大处理的在生活上已有了保障，有的还参加了工作。被管制的曹皆一在管制期间表现很好，现在已经撤销了管制，并在第十二化学生产合作社担任技师。他在工作中积极努力，曾研究成功数种药品，受到了奖励。
