Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, November 29th: According to a TASS report from Tirana on the 28th, the Albanian Labor Party, the Council of Ministers, and the National Committee of the Democratic Front jointly held a celebration meeting at the People's Theater in Tirana on the 28th to celebrate the twelfth anniversary of Albania's liberation.

Among those attending the celebration were Albanian Labor Party and government leaders Hoxha, Shehu, and Lleshi, workers from various enterprises in Tirana, representatives from all walks of life, figures from the scientific, cultural, and artistic circles, and soldiers from the People's Army.

Diplomatic envoys from the Soviet Union and some other countries to Albania also attended the celebration.

First Vice-Chairman of the Council of Ministers and member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party, Balluku, delivered a report at the meeting. When talking about the achievements the Albanian people had made in the twelve years of free life, he said that these years were years of intense struggle to strive for the prosperity of the motherland, eliminate backwardness that had existed for generations, and protect the motherland from aggression by enemies at home and abroad. Balluku said that in the years after the establishment of the people's democratic system, our party and government have pursued a consistent policy of peace in relations with other countries. As a result of implementing this policy, our country's international status has been greatly strengthened. Albania is a member of the powerful socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. Our people believe that friendship with the Soviet Union is the greatest achievement made under the leadership of the Labor Party. It is this friendship that gives the Albanian people infinite strength and strengthens their confidence that socialism will surely triumph.

When he talked about the aggression against Egypt by Britain, France, and Israel, he said that the world public was indignant at this despicable act of the aggressors.

Balluku talked about the Hungarian incident. He said that the Hungarian working people, with the help of the Soviet army, crushed the counter-revolution, saved the people's democratic system, and kept Hungary in the ranks of the socialist camp.

The attendees excitedly passed a message of respect to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government.
