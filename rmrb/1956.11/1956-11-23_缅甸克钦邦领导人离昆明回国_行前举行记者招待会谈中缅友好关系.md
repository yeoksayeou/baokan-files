At the famous scenic spot, the Stone Forest in Lunan County, the guests took photos with great interest next to many strange peaks and rocks, and visited the Shilin Agricultural Production Cooperative in Lunan County. Sani ethnic cadres from the cooperative introduced the production and living conditions of the cooperative to the guests, and the members also performed the "Axi Jumping Moon" dance for the guests.

Last night, U Zanhta Sin and others attended a banquet held by Liu Minghui, Vice Governor of Yunnan Province, in their honor.

U Zanhta Sin and others were warmly seen off at the airport today by the Vice Governor of Yunnan Province, the Mayor and Deputy Mayors of Kunming, and the responsible persons of various democratic parties in the province and city.

Colonel Nuo Dang, Military Attache of the Burmese Embassy in China, U Maung Maung Toe, Consul General of the Union of Burma in Kunming, and Gao Hongling, Consul of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in Kunming, also went to the airport to see them off.

Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, November 22nd: U Zanhta Sin, the Kachin State Leader and Kachin State Governor, said at a press conference he held this morning that the joint press communiqué recently issued by China and Burma will especially promote Sino-Burmese friendly relations.

The press conference was held at the Cuihu (Green Lake) Hotel in Kunming. U Zanhta Sin introduced the activities of their visit in China for more than three weeks. He said that in various places, "the leaders of the Chinese state and the leaders of provinces and cities treated us with meticulous hospitality in all aspects of food, clothing, shelter, and transportation, like brothers born of the same parents. We express our deep gratitude for this and will never forget it in our lives." He also said: "If China continues to maintain unity and enthusiasm as it does now, no imperialists will be able to invade China again."

When a reporter asked him about his views on the joint press communiqué issued by China and Burma, he said: "I believe that this joint press communiqué will be a joint press communiqué that will especially promote Sino-Burmese friendship." He believes that meetings between administrative officials of the two countries like this are helpful for mutual understanding and friendship.

Finally, at the request of reporters, he spoke about his impressions of Yunnan Province. He said that we had heard in the past that Kunming was a very unclean and disorderly city in the old government era. Now we see that it has made many times more progress in all aspects than in the past. He especially praised the Nationalities Institute established here.
