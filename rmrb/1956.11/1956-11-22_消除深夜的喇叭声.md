    Eliminate Late-Night Horns
    Some car drivers in Beijing still honk their horns at night as they do during the day. Sometimes, even when the car has already entered a quiet alley, they still sound the horn for a long time, often startling people who are sound asleep. I believe that when cars are driving at night, headlights are sufficient to alert pedestrians. There is no need to honk the horn unless absolutely necessary.

    消除深夜的喇叭声
    北京市有些汽车司机，在深夜行车时，仍像白天一样按喇叭，有时当汽车已经进入僻静的胡同，还要照样长鸣喇叭，因而往往把一些在酣睡中的人们惊醒。我认为，汽车在深夜行驶时，有灯光，就足以示知行人了，除非在不得已的情况下，可不必鸣喇叭。
