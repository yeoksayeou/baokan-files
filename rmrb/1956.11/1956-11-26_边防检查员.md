Border Inspector
By Our Correspondent Fu Dong

Inspector Li Zihui was examining the passengers' luggage carefully with his head down. There were so many people coming from Hong Kong this time, more than a thousand, packing the Shenzhen border checkpoint to the brim.

Li Zihui looked up and suddenly saw a passenger staring at him sideways. After a while, he looked up again and saw the passenger staring at another inspector. After another while, this time he consciously looked up and saw that the passenger was still watching intently. He thought, "There might be something fishy here."

He beckoned the passenger over.

The passenger was in his thirties, tall and thin, neatly dressed. He had on a white shirt, blue cloth pants, and his hair was combed shiny and neat.

The young inspector looked at the passenger's documents and saw that it read: Surname Yuan, from Shanghai, a barber, returning to Shanghai this time to visit relatives.

Before the inspector could ask any questions, the passenger introduced himself eagerly:

"I live on the third floor of No. × on × Road in Shanghai. I went to Hong Kong from Shanghai in 1950. I worked as a sailor there for a year and a half, rested for half a year, and then my cousin introduced me to work in a barber shop for three and a half years."

Li Zihui looked at the man's face.

"This man's eyes are sunken and he has double eyelids; these are typical Cantonese eyes. How can he say he's from Shanghai?"

Li Zihui didn't say anything. He asked the passenger to bring over his suitcase and said politely, "Please bring the suitcase to the inspection table."

"Okay, I'll lift (carry) it up."

"Lifting" is a local Hakka term from Guangdong. Li Zihui had heard Shanghainese speak their local dialect; they call "carrying" the word "Ning." This was obviously wrong, so he asked, "Are you from Shanghai?"

This man, surnamed Yuan, who had been speaking fluent Mandarin, suddenly switched to Shanghainese: "I'm a Shanghai person, you don't believe it?" Immediately after, he asked, "Where are you from?" Seeing that the inspector didn't make a sound, he continued, "If you're not from Shanghai, then you're from Jiangsu."

Li Zihui thought, "My Cantonese accent is so heavy, anyone can hear it, how can he say I'm from Jiangsu? Is he trying to use a fellow-townsman relationship to distract me?"

"Are you from Shanghai?" he asked again.

The passenger then realized he had slipped up and revealed his Hakka accent, so he hurriedly explained, "I'm from the countryside of Jiangsu, I went to Shanghai when I was nine years old. When the Japanese attacked, my father took me to Jiangxi for two years."

There are some Hakka people in Jiangxi. But why does he have a Hakka accent after only living there for two years? He lived in Hong Kong for five years, why doesn't he have a Cantonese accent? In Hong Kong, people all speak Cantonese!

He began to inspect the passenger's suitcase.

When the man surnamed Yuan opened the suitcase, Li Zihui paid special attention to the hands of this "worker." The hands of this "barber" were smooth and clean, with no calluses on his middle finger, which was very strange.

The passenger understood his "thoughts" and quickly said, "I had a bad relationship with the boss, he hasn't asked me to cut hair for the past six months, he only asked me to wash hair."

"Wash hair?" Li Zihui knew that the hands of hairdressers are constantly soaking in alkaline and soapy water, and some areas of their fingers would have peeled skin. Their fingernails are also longer than average people. But this "worker's" hands were fine, not broken at all, and his nails were cut very short.

He rummaged through the contents of the suitcase. The passenger stood by and watched nonchalantly.

While rummaging, he suddenly saw a pair of cloth shoes. He looked at them inside and out several times. The shoes were very old and broken, how come there wasn't even a single short hair on them? He always had to bring back a few hairs on himself when he got a haircut, how come this "barber" who cuts hair every day didn't have any?

He rummaged through everything, not letting go of even the smallest places, but he couldn't find anything.

The man surnamed Yuan, seeing that the inspection was over, happily asked with a smile, "Can I pack my things up?" While asking, he hurriedly closed the suitcase.

"Why is he in such a hurry? There might be a problem here, I have to check it carefully again, the questions from before haven't been answered yet!" he thought.

He opened the suitcase again. He saw a thick stack of stationery sandwiched in the middle of the clothes. Normally, people pack stationery at the bottom or top of the suitcase, not in the middle. Why did this passenger put the stationery in the middle of the clothes?

He took out the stationery to look at it.

The man surnamed Yuan cocked his head and said in a contemptuous tone, "What can you hide in stationery?" After a while, he said with a smile, "You guys are doing a really good job, this kind of spirit of serving the people is really admirable..."

Why is this person so concerned about the stationery? When he checked his clothes just now, he didn't say anything, why is he talking non-stop now? Is he trying to distract me?!

There were quite a few pieces of stationery, more than a hundred, and he turned each page carefully. When he turned to the seventh page from the end, he suddenly saw a sesame-sized black dot in the upper right corner of the paper. Li Zihui turned the stationery back and forth several times and recognized it as the letter "A" written with a brush.

"Whose stationery is this?" he asked.

"Mine."

"When did you buy it?"

"Yesterday."

"What is this?" he asked, pointing to the black dot.

"Stationery, it's stationery." The man surnamed Yuan tried to interrupt and slip away.

"I'm not asking about the stationery, I'm asking about this black dot?"

"How could there be this black dot?" The passenger pretended to take a look and said, "Maybe the owner of the stationery store did it."

"The owner sells so much paper every day, how could he have the time to write an 'A' on each book?"

"'A'!" He paused, scratched his head, and then said as if suddenly realizing, "Ah! I remember, last night I stayed at a friend's house from Hong Kong to Kowloon, I put my luggage on the ground, maybe the children drew it."

This was complete nonsense, if children wanted to draw, they would definitely draw little people or puppies, how could they respectfully write the letter "A"?

He took the stationery to a place with sunlight, and looked at it for a long time with his eyes close to the paper. He found that there were traces of water on several pages counting forward from the page with the "A" on it. This was a characteristic of secret writing. He took the stationery to the laboratory for testing.

Taking advantage of the time for this test, Li Zihui began the interrogation again:

"Is this stationery yours?"

"Yes, yes, it's mine." The passenger, who had been fluent in answering, couldn't speak clearly anymore.

"What is in the stationery?"

"I'm thinking, could the stationery have been switched by mistake at my friend's house last night!"

"Why didn't your friend switch your suitcase? Just switched the stationery! What does your friend do!"

"Sailor."

"Where does he live?"

"Chongcai Street, Kowloon."

Although Li Zihui had never been to Hong Kong or Kowloon, he often looked at maps and often chatted with passengers about the social situations, professional characteristics, and living conditions of various people in Hong Kong and Kowloon. He knew a lot.

"Chongcai Street is in the middle of Kowloon, how could a sailor live there? It's not by the sea?"

"My friend seems to be out of work!"

"Then how does he live?"

"He relies on friends for support... he smokes opium." The passenger became more and more unclear.

"What do your friend's friends do?"

"Not very good...." He sighed, paused for a long time, and said, "To tell you the truth, the stationery isn't mine. My friend asked me to bring it back to his younger brother in Shanghai."

"Stationery isn't a treasure, Shanghai has plenty of paper, why would he bring stationery from so far away? What does your friend's friend do?"

"I heard he's in some Ministry of National Defense."

Good, now things are coming to light. He took the passenger to the office. He explained in detail the government's policy on counter-revolutionary elements: Strict punishment for resistance, leniency for confession, rewards for meritorious service.

The "barber" now had nothing to say. He confessed that there were secret instructions written on the stationery, and that he had been sent to Shanghai as the leader of a spy group. He was from Xingning, Guangdong. He had worked as a spy in Shanghai for three and a half years before liberation, and had received specialized spy training in Taiwan after liberation.

"My superior valued me very much, thinking I had the ability and wouldn't make mistakes when I came back. I myself was confident that I wouldn't make any mistakes. My Shanghai dialect is so good, I'm very familiar with the area, who knew I would be arrested less than forty minutes after arriving on the mainland." The spy surnamed Yuan said dejectedly when he was arrested. (Attached picture)

    边防检查员
    本报记者　傅冬
    检查员李梓惠低着头仔细地检查旅客的行李。这一趟从香港来的人可真不少，足足有一千多，把深圳边防检查站挤得满满的。
    李梓惠抬起了头，忽然他看见一位旅客正斜着眼在盯着他看。过了一阵，他偶尔抬起了头，见那旅客又盯着另一个检查员在看。又过了一阵，这一次他是有意识地抬起头，见那旅客还在聚精会神地看。他想：“这里面可能有文章。”
    他招招手叫那个旅客过来。
    这个旅客三十来岁，高高瘦瘦的。穿戴得挺干净整齐。白衬衣蓝布裤、头发梳得又光又亮。
    年青的检查员看了看旅客的证件，见上面写着：姓袁，上海人，理发工人，这次回国是去上海探亲。
    这旅客不等检查员问话，就殷勤地自我介绍：
    “我家住上海×路×号三楼。我1950年由上海去的香港。在那里作了一年半的海员，住闲了半年，以后由表姐介绍到一个理发馆工作了三年半。”
    李梓惠看了一下这个人的脸。
    “这人的眼睛是凹进去的，而且是双眼皮；这是典型的广东人的眼睛。怎么他说他是上海人？”
    李梓惠没说什么。他叫旅客把箱子拿过来，他客气地说：“请把箱子提到检查台上来。”
    “好，拎（提）上来。”
    “拎”是广东客家话的土音。李梓惠听过上海人讲土话，他们把“提”字叫做“宁”字。这显然不对头，于是他问了一声：“你是上海人吗？”
    这个姓袁的本来讲着一口流利的普通话，这时突然改用上海话说：“阿拉（我）是上海宁（人），侬（你）勿（不）相信？”紧接着又问：“侬（你）啥地方宁（人）？”见检查员没啃声，他又接着说：“侬（你）勿（不）是上海宁（人）就是江苏宁（人）。”
    李梓惠心里琢磨：“我的广东口音那么重，这谁都能听出来，他怎么说我是江苏人？他是想拉同乡关系扰乱我的注意力？”
    “你是上海人吗？”他又问了一遍。
    旅客这时发觉自己说溜了嘴，漏了客家土话，就急忙解释：“我是江苏乡下人，九岁到的上海。日本人打来时，我父亲带我到江西住了两年。”
    江西是有一些客家人。但为什么他只住了两年就有客家口音？他在香港住了五年倒没广东口音？在香港，人们都讲广州话呀！
    他开始检查这个旅客的箱子。
    当姓袁的开箱子的时候，李梓惠特别看了一下这位“工人”的手。这位“理发工人”的手光光净净的，中指上没有茧，这可怪了。
    旅客明白了他的“心思”，连忙说：“我和老板关系搞得不好，这半年他不叫我理发，只叫我给洗洗头。”
    “洗洗头？”李梓惠可知道洗头发工人的手，他们的手一天到晚在碱水肥皂水里泡，手指上有好些地方退了皮。他们的手指甲也比一般人长。可是这位“工人”的手却是好好的，没破一点，指甲剪的很短。
    他翻看箱子里的东西。旅客满不在乎的站在旁边看。
    翻着，翻着，他忽然看见一双布鞋。他里里外外看了好几遍，鞋已经很旧很破了，怎么连一根短头发都没有？平日自己理一次发，回来身上总要带几根头发，这个“理发工人”天天理发怎么反倒没有？
    统统翻完了，连小地方也没放过，可什么也没找到。
    姓袁的一见检查完了，高兴得什么似的笑着问：“我可以把东西收拾起来吗？”一面问，一面急急忙忙盖箱子。
    “他为什么这么着急？这里面可能有问题，得细细地再查一查，刚才的那些疑问还都没有答案呢！”他这样想。
    他又打开了箱子。他看见衣服中间夹着一厚叠信纸，平常人装箱不是把信纸放在箱子底就是放在箱子上，没放在中间的，这个旅客为什么把信纸放在衣服中间？
    他拿出信纸来看。
    姓袁的歪着脑袋用一种轻蔑的口吻说：“信纸里会藏什么？”过了一会又笑嘻嘻地说：“你们工作得真好，这种为人民服务的精神真叫人钦佩……”
    这个人为什么这样关心信纸？刚才查他的衣服的时候，他没说什么，这会子怎么老说没完？他是想分散我的精力？！
    这一叠信纸真不少，有一百多张，他一页一页用心翻着。翻到倒数第七页的时候，忽然看见在纸的右上方有一个芝麻大的黑点。李梓惠把信纸转过来转过去看了几遍，认出是个用毛笔写的“A”字。
    “信纸是谁的？”他问。
    “我的。”
    “什么时候买的？”
    “昨天。”
    “这是什么东西？”他指着黑点问。
    “信纸，是信纸。”姓袁的想打岔滑过去。
    “不是问你信纸，是问你这个黑点？”
    “怎么会有这个黑点？”旅客假装着看了一眼说：“可能是文具店的老板搞的。”
    “老板一天卖那么多纸，怎么会有功夫一本一本写个‘A’字？”
    “‘A’字！”他停了停，又搔了搔头，然后像是恍然大悟的样子说：“啊！想起来了，昨天晚上从香港到九龙住在一个朋友家，我把行李放在地上，可能是孩子们给画的。”
    这真是胡说八道，小孩子要画画，准是画小人小狗，怎么会恭恭敬敬写个“A”字？
    他把信纸拿到有阳光的地方，眼睛紧贴在纸上看了半天，发现从有“A”字的那张纸往前数，有好几页纸上有水涂过的痕迹。这是密写过的特征。他把信纸拿到化验室去化验。
    利用这个化验的时间，李梓惠又开始了讯问：
    “信纸是你的吗？”
    “是，是，是我的。”原来对答如流的旅客，说不清楚话了。
    “信纸里是什么东西？”
    “我正在想，信纸是不是昨天晚上在朋友家换错了！”
    “你的朋友为什么不把你的皮箱换掉？单单把信纸换了！你的朋友是做什么的！”
    “海员。”
    “住在什么地方？”
    “九龙冲菜街。”
    香港、九龙李梓惠虽然没去过。但他常看地图，也常和旅客闲谈香港、九龙的社会情况，各种人的职业特征和生活状况。他知道的很多。
    “冲菜街在九龙中间，海员怎么会住到那里？那儿不靠海？”
    “我的朋友好像没事了！”
    “那他的生活怎么办？”
    “靠朋友接济……他抽大烟。”旅客越说越不清楚了。
    “你朋友的朋友干什么？”
    “不大好。……”他唉了声气，停了半天说：“说老实话，信纸不是我的。是我朋友叫我带回上海给他弟弟的。”
    “信纸又不是什么宝贝，上海有的是纸，为什么要老远地带信纸？你朋友的朋友是干什么的？”
    “听说是在什么国防部。”
    好，现在事情有眉目了。他带旅客到办公室去。他详细地讲解政府对反革命分子的政策：抗拒从严、坦白从宽、立功者受奖。
    这个“理发工人”现在没话可说了。他承认了信纸上有密写的指示，他是被派往上海当特务组长。他是广东兴宁人，解放前在上海作过三年半特务，解放后又在台湾受过专门的特务训练。
    “我的上司很重视我，认为我有办法，回来一定不会出错。我自己也自信不会出漏子。我的上海话讲得那么好，人地都挺熟，哪知道刚到大陆还不到四十分钟就被捕了。”姓袁的特务在被捕的时候沮丧地说。（附图片）
