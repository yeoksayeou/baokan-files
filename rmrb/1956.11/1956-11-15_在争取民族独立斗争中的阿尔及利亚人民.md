The Algerian People in the Struggle for National Independence
Buhali, First Secretary of the Algerian Communist Party

During my stay in China, I witnessed how deeply the Chinese people and Chinese workers care about the African people's struggle for peace and national independence. I was deeply moved by the Chinese workers' indignation at the French government's kidnapping of the five leaders of the Algerian National Liberation Front. Therefore, it is not without significance to remind the readers of the "People's Daily" of some basic facts about the Algerian question.

Every French colonial ruler has tried to prove to world opinion that "Algeria is France." The leaders of the ruling French Socialist Party, faced with the fierce resistance of the Algerian people, abandoned this absurd formula, but they continue to declare that the Algerian issue is "France's internal affair" and that the leaders of the Algerian people's resistance movement are "foreign agents" serving "Arab imperialism" and "Islamic fanaticism"...

The Chinese people have certainly not forgotten the similar charges leveled by the Japanese imperialists.

As everyone knows, Algeria was conquered by force 126 years ago and turned into a colony. The Algerian people have never accepted this colonial status. They have waged continuous resistance, of varying intensity. Several large-scale armed uprisings are the hallmarks of this resistance.

With the conquest and the establishment of colonial rule, the wealth of the Algerian people was systematically plundered.

After the peasants lost their land, the distribution of Algerian arable land was as follows: 25,000 European colonists occupied 2,720,000 hectares of arable land, and 532,000 Algerian landholders (of whom 5,600 were large landowners) occupied 7,620,000 hectares of arable land. And European colonists generally occupied the better land.

All the mines, all the credit institutions, the main processing industries, large commerce, and means of transportation are controlled by the colonists.

The result of this situation is that the Algerian people, whose main food is grain, could obtain 400 kilograms of grain per person per year in 1871, while now they cannot even get 200 kilograms per person per year. The average income of the Algerian people is about 21,000 francs per person per year, but the average income of the French is about 240,000 francs per person per year. Thus, it is not surprising to find that out of Algeria's ten million people, 400,000 suffer from lung disease, while out of France's population of 42 million, only 400,000 suffer from lung disease.

Less than 200,000 children attend school, while nearly two million school-age children are out on the streets with no school to attend. Children who do attend school are forced to learn French, while the language of their homeland, Arabic, is treated as a foreign language.

This allows the colonists to extract huge super-profits in Algeria. Taking only the published profit figures of 23 colonial enterprises, from 1947 to 1953, the profits of these 23 enterprises increased from 462.2 million francs to 6,579.9 million francs. In 1952, the published profits of "Ouenza Company," "Mokta el Hadid Company," and "Miri Aana Mining and Metallurgical Company" were 3.5 billion francs, while the total wages paid by these companies to workers were only 1.5 billion francs.

To safeguard these privileges, the colonists systematically excluded Algerians from the management of their country's economic and political affairs. Of Algeria's ten million people, about one million are residents of European origin, who came to Algeria after 1830, and most of them have established families in Algeria. These people, generally speaking, enjoy the same rights as French citizens in France. Although most of them are workers, the colonists have given them some rights superior to those of Algerian workers, using this method to deceive them and use them to support colonial rule. In this way, a small handful of colonists were able not only to rule Algeria, but also, to some extent, rule France itself.

After the First World War, amidst the great upsurge of the October Socialist Revolution, various organizations and parties were formed, including the Algerian Communist Party. These organizations and parties have developed in the struggle to change the above situation. The national movement grew so powerful that after the Second World War, it won the legal status of democratic organizations, parties, and their publications, and also won some democratic rights for the people, including very limited suffrage.

However, the colonists could not tolerate their slaves raising their heads. They quickly regarded the laws passed by the French Parliament as mere scraps of paper, and they abolished the legitimate representatives of the Algerian people. The Algerian people felt like foreigners and stateless people in their own country, suffering cruel exploitation and constantly subjected to the humiliation of hateful racial discrimination. They saw no other way to escape their suffering except armed struggle.

If the French rulers did not recognize the historical significance of the liberation of the Chinese people and the Bandung Conference, if they did not learn from the Vietnam War and their failures in Tunisia and Morocco, then we, the Algerian people, have benefited from it. It was under these circumstances that on the night of October 31 to November 1, 1954, armed uprisings broke out in various parts of Algeria, followed by the establishment of the National Liberation Front and the National Liberation Army.

Initially, the French colonial rulers falsely labeled the Algerian patriots as "bandits," claiming that they could be eliminated in a few weeks, or at most a few months. However, for two years, the French colonial rulers have continuously increased their troops in Algeria. On November 1, 1954, France had less than 50,000 soldiers in Algeria, but now it has exceeded 500,000. Despite repeated denials by the French colonial rulers, in reality, they have launched a fierce colonial war against the Algerian people. In this war, they have not hesitated to use the most modern machinery against the masses of the people: automatic weapons, artillery, tanks, airplanes, helicopters, warships... The military operations in some areas have the character of a war of destruction. In addition, approximately 200,000 Algerians have been massacred in the past two years. Most of them were women, children, and the elderly.

In addition to war and indiscriminate massacres, the colonists have also attempted to subdue our people through terrifying police repression. No fewer than ten thousand patriots are in prisons and concentration camps. The colonists' police adopted and enriched Hitler-style torture. In addition to electric shock and forced water ingestion, they also put patriots on airplanes, and if they refused to "talk," they were thrown from a height of 500 meters. The number of Algerians sentenced to death has reached 245, of whom five have already been executed. This is the bankrupt "pacification" policy of the "Socialist" Lacoste.

Yes, this policy of violence has completely failed to intimidate our people. On the contrary, it has enabled our people to mobilize more effectively in the national liberation war.

If, in the early stages, the armed struggle was limited to certain mountainous areas in eastern Algeria, now it has spread throughout the country. The armed struggle has also spread to the cities themselves. In the city of Algiers alone, 114 patriotic incidents occurred in September. The National Liberation Army, constantly trained and armed in the struggle, has frequently inflicted increasingly heavy losses on the colonists' army. It has become an armed force feared by the colonists' army. In August, the colonists' newspaper "Algeria Daily" had to admit itself: "The troops stationed in Algeria should now understand what it means to fight against a powerful opponent who has received good combat training, is well-equipped, and possesses incomparable courage."

However, this young army draws its strength from the people. It comes from the people, and the people support it in various ways. In the struggle, this national unity has been expressed very clearly on many occasions, as shown by the general strike on July 5 and the student strike in October.

The current goal of the Algerian resistance movement is to obtain the French government's recognition of the Algerian state and the national independence of Algeria, as it did for Morocco and Tunisia. The Algerian resistance movement unanimously agrees that after independence, Algeria should be established as a democratic, socialist republic and that land reform should be implemented to distribute land to the peasants.

The Algerian Communist Party, representing the special interests of the working class and poor peasants, believes that the above is its current main goal. Around this goal, the Algerian Communist Party is committed to achieving a broad national alliance that includes all patriots, regardless of class, political affiliation, or ethnicity. In this spirit, after consultation with relevant parties, an agreement was reached that the Algerian Communist Party would dissolve its armed forces and merge them into the National Liberation Army. Algerian Communist Party members are working tirelessly to merge the existing various trade union organizations into a unified national central trade union that is open to all Algerian workers on an equal footing. The Algerian Communist Party also advocates and hopes that the Algerian National Liberation Front will be expanded politically, especially to include communists, in order to fully and thoroughly realize the national aspirations of the Algerian people.

The Algerian people are now clearly aware of their strength and believe that they will never stop the current struggle if their just cause is not victorious. Now is no longer the era when colonialists can indulge in war and killing as they did in the past, because the world has undergone profound changes. The socialist camp, headed by the Soviet Union and People's China, strongly supports the just cause of all peoples. The Arab people, who have gained national independence and established friendly relations with socialist countries, can give us strong support. Moreover, this colonial bandit war is completely contrary to the interests of the French working class, which explains why the French working class is not only fighting for peace in Algeria in France, but also why many sons of the French working class refuse to fight against Algerians.

It should also be pointed out that Algerians do not like this cruel war imposed on them by the greed, racial discrimination, and blindness of the French colonists. If the Algerian people are prepared to shed their last drop of blood to fight for the recognition of their inalienable rights, they are equally prepared to stop this war, which is against their interests, against the interests of the French people, and against world peace. Therefore, the spokesmen of the resistance movement have repeatedly stated that they are always ready to negotiate and always ready to seek a peaceful solution that respects both the national aspirations of the Algerian people and the legitimate interests of France and the Europeans in Algeria.

It is worth noting that the French rulers have never done anything to free the deceived class among the colonists from their shackles. If one finds European Algerians in the ranks of the resistance movement's army, or finds European Algerians supporting the resistance movement's army in other ways, this should be attributed to the wise and tireless efforts of the Algerian Communist Party.

However, despite the Algerian resistance movement's expression of its desire for negotiations, the French government, on the contrary, hopes to destroy the Algerian people militarily and demands the complete surrender of the Algerian people. The following actions of the French government are full proof: The French government kidnapped the five leaders of the Algerian National Liberation Front, the French government ignored the suggestions of Prime Minister Nehru and the Brioni Conference, and the French government disregarded the motion of the French Socialist Party's Lille Congress, while Mollet remained the party's general secretary...

The French government believes that the threat of the criminal aggression against Egypt by Israel, supported by Britain, France, and the United States, can divert people's attention from the Algerian issue. But this adventurous policy absolutely cannot solve the Algerian issue. Such a policy, like the kidnapping of the five leaders of the Algerian National Liberation Front, proves that the French colonists have lost their minds and are digging their own graves.

As for the Algerian people, they have no doubt that their noble cause will be victorious. They will unite with all forces in the world that desire freedom and peace and carry on their heroic struggle until victory. They will never recognize any result that is not obtained through general negotiations with their qualified representatives.

If the French government truly hopes to stop the bloodshed and establish the basis for friendly relations between Algeria and France, it can only immediately release the leaders of the Algerian National Liberation Front and immediately negotiate with the only effective and responsible party—"the Algerian resistance."

    在争取民族独立斗争中的阿尔及利亚人民
    阿尔及利亚共产党第一书记　布哈利
    当我逗留在中国的时候，我看到了中国人民、中国工人是多么深切地关怀着非洲人民争取和平、争取民族独立的斗争。中国工人对法国政府绑架阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线五位领袖的行为所表示的愤慨，使我深为感动。因此，向“人民日报”的读者们重提一下阿尔及利亚问题的若干基本事实，不是一件没有意义的事。
    每一个法国殖民统治者都力图向世界舆论证明“阿尔及利亚就是法国”。执政的法国社会党的领袖们，在阿尔及利亚人民猛烈的抵抗下放弃了这个荒谬的公式，可是他们仍旧不断地宣称：阿尔及利亚问题是“法国的内政”，阿尔及利亚人民抵抗运动的领袖是为“阿拉伯帝国主义”及“回教狂”服务的“外国的代理人”……
    中国人民自然没有忘记日本帝国主义者所加的与此类似的一些罪名。
    谁都知道，一百二十六年以来，阿尔及利亚被武力所征服，变成了一个殖民地。阿尔及利亚人民从来没有接受这个殖民地的地位。他们进行了强弱不等、持续不断的抵抗。几次规模巨大的武装起义就是抵抗的标志。
    随着征服与殖民统治的建立，阿尔及利亚人民的财富被有系统地剥夺了。
    农民失去了土地以后，阿尔及利亚耕地分配的情况是这样的：两万五千名欧洲殖民者占有二百七十二万公顷耕地，五十三万二千阿尔及利亚土地占有者（其中五千六百名为大地主）占有七百六十二万公顷耕地。而欧洲殖民者一般地占有较好的土地。
    所有的矿山，全部的信贷机构，主要的加工工业，大商业，交通运输工具都操纵在殖民者手中。
    这种情况的结果是：以谷物为主要粮食的阿尔及利亚人民，在1871年每人每年可得四百公斤的谷物，而现在每人每年连二百公斤都分不到。阿尔及利亚人民平均的收入，每人每年约两万一千法郎，但是法国人的平均收入，每人每年约二十四万法郎。这样，人们发现阿尔及利亚的一千万人口里，患肺病的有四十万人，法国人口四千二百万，其中患肺病的也只有四十万人，就不是什么令人诧异的事了。
    入学的儿童不及二十万名，而流落街头无学校可进的学龄儿童将近两百万名以上。入学的儿童都被迫学习法语，而祖国的语言、阿拉伯语反被当作是一种外国语。
    这样就使殖民者在阿尔及利亚掠取了巨大的超额利润。仅以殖民者的二十三个企业所公布的利润数字而论，从1947年到1953年，这二十三个企业的利润从四亿六千二百万法郎增加到六十五亿七千九百万法郎。1952年“乌翁沙公司”，“莫可达和阿迪公司”，“米里阿那采矿冶金公司”所公布的利润为三十五亿法郎，而这些公司付给工人的工资总共不过只有十五亿法郎。
    为了保障这种特权，殖民者有系统地排斥了阿尔及利亚人对自己国家经济、政治计划的管理。在阿尔及利亚的一千万人口中，大约有一百万原籍欧洲人的居民，他们是在1830年以后到阿尔及利亚来的，大部分都已经在阿尔及利亚成立家室。这些人，一般而论，都享有与法国公民在法国所享有的同样的权利。虽然他们大都是工人，可是殖民者却给予他们比阿尔及利亚工人较优的若干权利，用这个方法欺骗了他们，利用他们来支持殖民统治。这样，一小撮的殖民者不但能够统治了阿尔及利亚，他们在若干程度上也统治了法国本身。
    第一次世界大战以后，在伟大的十月社会主义革命的激荡里，产生了包括阿尔及利亚共产党在内的各种组织与政党。这些组织与政党在以改变上述情况为目的的斗争中日益发展。民族运动声势如此浩大，以致于在第二次世界大战以后，争得了民主组织、政党及它们的新闻出版的合法地位，也为人民争得了一些民主的权利，其中包括着十分有限的选举权。
    但是，殖民者不能容忍他们的奴隶抬起头来。他们很快地就把法国议会所通过的法令视同具文，他们撤废了阿尔及利亚人民的合法代表。阿尔及利亚人民在自己的国土里竟感到自己是异国人、是无国籍的人，遭到残酷的剥削，经常受到可憎的种族歧视的羞辱，除了武装斗争以外，他们看不出有其他的方法可以摆脱自己的苦难。
    如果说，法国统治者没有认识中国人民的解放以及万隆会议的历史意义，如果说他们没有从越南战争以及他们在突尼斯、摩洛哥的失败中吸取教训，那么，对我们阿尔及利亚人民说来，我们是受到了益处的。就在这种情势下，1954年10月31日到11月1日的那个晚上，阿尔及利亚各处发动了武装起义，接着成立了民族解放阵线与民族解放军。
    最初，法国殖民统治者把阿尔及利亚的爱国志士诬称为“匪徒”，扬言不出数周、至多不出数月就可以予以肃清。可是两年以来，法国殖民统治者不断地增加在阿尔及利亚的军队。1954年11月1日，法国在阿尔及利亚的兵士不足五万名，而现在已经超过了五十万名。尽管法国殖民统治者一再否认，实际上，他们对阿尔及利亚人民发动了一个猛烈的殖民战争。在这个战争里，他们毫不犹豫地对人民群众使用最现代化的机械：自动化武器、大炮、坦克、飞机、直升飞机、军舰……。若干地区的军事行动具有毁灭性战争的性质。除此以外，两年以来被屠杀的阿尔及利亚人大约有二十万名。其中大部分为妇孺老弱。
    除了战争与不分青红皂白的屠杀，殖民者还企图利用恐怖的警察镇压来制服我们的人民。在监狱与集中营的爱国志士不下万余名。殖民者的警察采用、并充实了希特勒式的酷刑。除了电刑、腹中灌水令人气绝这些惨刑以外，他们还把爱国志士载上飞机，如果他们不肯“说话”，就被从五百公尺的高空抛下来。现在被判死刑的阿尔及利亚人已达二百四十五名，业已执行的有五名。这就是“社会主义者”拉戈斯特的、早已破了产的“绥靖”政策。
    是的，这个暴力政策完全没有吓倒我们的人民，相反地，它使我们的人民在民族解放战争中更有效地动员起来。
    如果说在初期，武装斗争的进行仅限于阿尔及利亚东部的若干山区，现在，它已经扩展到了全境。武装斗争也波及城市本身。就在阿尔及尔一城，9月份共发生爱国事件一百一十四起。在斗争中不断锻炼与武装起来的民族解放军，经常使殖民者的军队遭受愈来愈为惨重的损失。它已经成了殖民者的军队所惧怕的武装力量。8月，殖民者的报纸“阿尔及尔日报”不得不自己供认说：“驻扎在阿尔及利亚的部队，现在该懂得与受过良好战斗训练、装备相当好的强有力的对手、具有无可比拟的勇气的敌人作战，是什么意义。”
    但是，这一支年青的军队是从人民那里得到力量的。它来自人民，人民用各种不同的方式来支持它。在战斗中，这种民族的团结性，多次极其鲜明地表现出来，正如7月5日的总罢工以及10月学生的罢课事件所表现的那样。
    阿尔及利亚抵抗运动的当前目标是取得法国政府对阿尔及利亚国家以及阿尔及利亚民族独立的承认，如同它对摩洛哥与突尼斯的承认一样。阿尔及利亚抵抗运动一致同意在取得独立以后，把阿尔及利亚建立为一个民主的、社会主义的共和国并实行土地改革、将土地分配给农民。
    代表着工人阶级与贫农的特殊利益的阿尔及利亚共产党，认为以上就是它的当前主要目标。围绕着这一个目标，阿尔及利亚共产党致力于实现一个不分阶级、不分政治倾向、不分种族包括一切爱国志士的一个广大的民族联盟。根据这样的精神，经过了与有关各方的协商，达成协议，阿尔及利亚共产党解散了它所控制的武装部队，把它们并入民族解放军。阿尔及利亚共产党党员不倦地为着把现存的各种不同的工会组织合并为一个统一的、向所有的阿尔及利亚工人开门的、一视同仁的全国中央工会而努力。阿尔及利亚共产党也主张并且希望阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线在政治上，尤其是对共产党人加以扩大，以充分而彻底地实现阿尔及利亚人民的民族愿望。
    阿尔及利亚人民现在很清楚地意识到自己的力量，并且认为如果他们的正义事业没有得到胜利，就决不停止当前的斗争。现在已经不是殖民主义者可以像从前那样沉溺于战争杀戮的时代了，因为世界已经发生了深刻的变化。以苏联及人民中国为首的社会主义阵营有力地支持了一切人民的正义事业，已经获得了民族独立并且与社会主义国家建立了友好关系的阿拉伯人民，能够给我们以有力的支援。而且，这个殖民匪徒的战争是完全不符合法国工人阶级的利益的，这就说明了为什么法国工人阶级不但在法国为阿尔及利亚的和平而斗争，而且还有不少的法国工人阶级的子弟们拒绝对阿尔及利亚人作战。
    还应该指出，阿尔及利亚人是不欢喜这个由法国殖民者的贪婪、种族歧视、盲目性所加在他们身上的残酷的战争的。如果说阿尔及利亚人民准备为争取承认他们的不可剥夺的权利，流尽最后一滴血，他们同样地准备着停止这个违反他们利益、违反法国人民利益、违反世界和平的战争。因此，抵抗运动的发言人不断地声明：他们随时准备着谈判，随时准备着寻求一个既尊重阿尔及利亚人民民族愿望、又能尊重法国及阿尔及利亚的欧洲人正当利益的和平解决办法。
    值得注意的是，法国统治者从来没有做什么事来使殖民者中那个受了他们欺骗的阶层解除束缚。如果人们发现抵抗运动的军队里有欧洲籍的阿尔及利亚人，或是发现欧洲籍的阿尔及利亚人用其他的方式来支援抵抗运动的军队，这是应该归功于阿尔及利亚共产党英明与不倦的努力的。
    可是，尽管阿尔及利亚抵抗运动表示了谈判的愿望，法国政府却相反地希望在军事上摧毁阿尔及利亚人民、要求阿尔及利亚人民彻底投降。法国政府的下列行动就是充分的证明：法国政府绑架了阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线的五位领袖，法国政府不理睬尼赫鲁总理与布里俄尼会议的建议，法国政府不顾法国社会党里尔大会的动议，而摩勒还一直是该党的总书记……
    法国政府以为在英、法、美支持下以色列对埃及发动犯罪的侵略的威胁，可以转移人们对阿尔及利亚问题的注意。但是这种冒险的政策绝对解决不了阿尔及利亚问题。这样的政策，正如绑架阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线五位领袖的举动一样，证明法国殖民者丧失了理智、他们在自掘坟墓。
    至于阿尔及利亚人民，他们绝不怀疑他们的崇高事业一定会得到胜利。他们要与全世界一切希望自由与和平的力量团结起来，把自己的英勇战斗进行到获得胜利为止。他们决不承认任何不经过与他们的合格代表进行一般谈判而得出的结果。
    如果法国政府当真希望停止流血并且建立阿尔及利亚与法国之间友好关系的基础，它只有立即释放阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线的领袖、立即与唯一的有效的负责方面——“阿尔及利亚抵抗”进行谈判。
