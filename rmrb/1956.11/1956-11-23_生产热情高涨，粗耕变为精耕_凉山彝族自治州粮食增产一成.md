Xinhua News Agency, Zhaojue, 22nd - The Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture in Sichuan Province has had a bumper harvest this year. According to statistics from the agricultural department, the total grain output of the prefecture has increased by 10% compared to last year.

    In this undulating mountainous area, the autumn harvest period lasts for several months. At present, the main crops such as buckwheat, potatoes, oats, and corn have been successively harvested in the warm river valleys and cold semi-mountainous and high-mountainous areas. Rice is still being harvested in some individual areas.

    This year, most areas of Liangshan completed democratic reform, and the soaring production enthusiasm of the farmers and the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement have brought tremendous changes to agricultural production. In previous years, about half of the land in the prefecture was cultivated without fertilization. This year, many villages and cooperatives have increased fertilization by more than double compared to the past. The number of plowing and inter-tillage operations has also increased. In Zhaojue County, land has generally been inter-tilled twice this year. In areas where reform has been completed, the vast majority of over 600 agricultural cooperatives have increased production by 20% to 30% compared to last year; mutual aid teams and individual farmers have also increased production by more than 10%. The corn yield of agricultural cooperatives generally reached 150 jin per mu, while the average corn yield last year was only about 100 jin.

    This year, rainfall was evenly distributed in the Liangshan area, with only a few areas experiencing natural disasters. Some areas experienced reduced production due to disasters and other reasons.

    In order to help the broad masses of farmers, especially the slaves who have just gained independent lives, the local people's governments of the autonomous prefecture have distributed more than 130,000 pieces of iron agricultural implements, more than 2 million jin of relief grain, and more than 2 million yuan of agricultural loans free of charge this year.

    生产热情高涨，粗耕变为精耕
    凉山彝族自治州粮食增产一成
    新华社昭觉22日电　四川省凉山彝族自治州今年丰收。据农业部门统计，全州粮食总产量比去年增加一成。
    在这个绵延起伏的山区里，秋收期长达几个月。目前，主要作物荞麦、马铃薯、燕麦、玉米等，已经先后在温暖的河谷和寒冷的半山区、高山区收割完毕，个别地区还在收获水稻。
    今年凉山大部地区完成民主改革，农民高涨的生产热情和互助合作运动的发展，给农业生产带来了巨大的变化。往年全州约有一半的土地不施肥就耕种，今年许多村、社施肥都比过去增加一倍以上。犁地和中耕的次数也有增加，昭觉县今年土地一般都做到中耕两次。在已经完成改革的地区内，六百多个农业社绝大部分都比去年增产20％到30％；互助组、单干农民也都增产一成以上。农业社的玉米一般每亩都收到一百五十斤，去年玉米平均产量只有一百斤左右。
    今年，凉山地区雨水均匀，只个别地区有自然灾害。部分地区因灾害等原因减产。
    为了帮助广大农民特别是才获得独立生活的奴隶解决困难，自治州各地人民政府今年无偿发放了十三万多件铁质农具、二百多万斤救济粮和二百多万元农业贷款。
