Guangzhou, November 23 (Dispatch from our newspaper) — Most of Guangdong Province's forty million mu of late rice fields have completed their autumn harvest. Judging from the current harvesting situation, although eight million mu of late rice fields suffered from drought this year, the total output of late rice in the province is still estimated to maintain last year's level and slightly increase. If we add the increased output of spring and summer harvested grain crops this year, the total grain output for the year will still increase by more than two billion jin compared to last year, which is the largest increase since liberation.

In the eastern part of Hainan Island and the Leizhou Peninsula, where the autumn harvest season is earlier, the rice ears are generally full and tall. Wanning County's late rice production this year increased by 9.1% compared to the bumper harvest year of 1954 during the same period. Xuwen, Haikang, and other counties, which had abundant rainfall this year, had better harvests than last year, regardless of whether they were lakeside fields or mountain valley fields. The Mentougou Advanced Cooperative in Liantang Township, Huaxian County, which persisted in fighting the drought for more than sixty days, achieved an average yield of more than 450 jin per mu of late rice. It is expected that the total annual output of rice can increase by about 40%. Although Chao'an, Chenghai, and Chaoyang counties suffered from drought and lack of fertilizer, they can still maintain the glorious title of "Thousand Jin Grain Counties" this year after the farmers strengthened field management.

This year, 80% of the rice fields in Guangdong Province implemented close planting of small clusters, single plants, and double plants. 1.7 million mu implemented intercropping to continuous cropping, and 2.18 million mu were converted from single-season rice to double-season rice. At the same time, local Party organizations and governments adopted a series of policies to support production, thus ensuring that grain crops still increased production in a year of drought.

    广东今年增产粮食二十亿斤
    本报广州23日电　广东省四千万亩晚稻大部分已完成秋收工作。从目前收割情况看来，虽然今年有八百万亩种晚稻的耕地遭受旱灾，但全省晚稻产量，估计仍可保持去年水平，并稍有增产。如果加上今年春收和夏收粮食作物的增产部分，全年的粮食总产量仍然可比去年增产二十亿斤以上，是解放以来增产数量最多的一年。
    秋收季节较早的海南岛东部和雷州半岛，稻穗普遍长得饱满高大。万宁县今年晚稻比大丰收的1954年同期增产9.1％。今年雨水充沛的徐闻、海康等县，不论湖洋田、山坑田都比去年收成好。坚持抗旱六十多天的花县莲塘乡门口坑高级社，晚稻平均每亩产四百五十多斤，预计全年稻谷总产量可以增产四成左右。潮安、澄海、潮阳三县虽然遭受旱灾和缺乏肥料，但是，经过农民加强田间管理以后，今年仍然可以保持“粮食千斤县”的光荣称号。
    今年广东省有80％的稻田实行了小科密植、单株和双株密植，有一百七十万亩实行间作改连作，有二百一十八万亩由一季稻改为双季稻。同时，当地党组织和政府又采取了一系列的扶助生产的政策，因而保证了粮食作物在旱灾的年头仍然增产。
