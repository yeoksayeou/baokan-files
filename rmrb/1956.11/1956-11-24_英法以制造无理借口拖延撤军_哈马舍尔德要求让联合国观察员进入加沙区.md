Xinhua News Agency, November 23rd, New York Dispatch: UN Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjöld presented to the UN General Assembly on the 22nd the replies from the British, French, and Israeli governments to the UN Secretary-General's letters regarding the withdrawal of troops from Egypt.

Hammarskjöld reported to the General Assembly that the British, French, and Israeli governments all indicated in their replies that they did not intend to withdraw all their troops from Egypt until they were "completely satisfied" with the arrangements for the UN forces to carry out their peaceful supervisory duties.

Britain said in its reply to Hammarskjöld: "At present, the UN Emergency Force is still in the formative stage and cannot effectively carry out the tasks entrusted to it. However, the Government of the United Kingdom has decided to immediately withdraw one battalion of infantry from Port Said to demonstrate its intention. The withdrawal of other troops will take place when the UN force becomes effective."

France's reply stated that the French government was studying the withdrawal plan, but also said: "It is difficult to finalize such a plan before the necessary contact has been made between the Anglo-French Joint Command and the International Emergency Force Command."

Xinhua News Agency, November 23rd, New York Dispatch: According to an Associated Press dispatch from New York, UN Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjöld urged Israel on the 22nd to allow UN Emergency Force observers to enter the Gaza Strip. Israeli troops killed about fifty Palestinian Arab refugees in Rafah in this area on November 12th.

Hammarskjöld released a letter to Israeli Foreign Minister Golda Meir, repeating an earlier request to allow UN observers to "enter, reside in, and carry out missions within the Gaza Strip."

    英法以制造无理借口拖延撤军
    哈马舍尔德要求让联合国观察员进入加沙区
    新华社23日讯　纽约消息：联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德22日向联合国大会提出了英、法、以色列三国政府就从埃及撤军的问题答复联合国秘书长的信件。
    哈马舍尔德向大会报告说：英法和以色列三国政府都在答复中表明，在它们对关于联合国部队执行和平监督任务的安排感到“完全满意”以前，它们不打算从埃及撤出它们的全部军队。
    英国在给哈马舍尔德的答复中说：“目前，联合国紧急部队尚在成立阶段，它还不能有效地执行委托给它的任务。但是联合王国政府决定立即从塞得港撤出一营步兵，以表示它的意图。其他部队要到联合国部队发生效力的时候进行撤退。
    法国的答复说，法国政府正在研究撤军计划，但是又说：“在英法联军司令部和国际紧急部队司令部之间进行了必要的接触之前，很难最后确定这种计划。”
    新华社23日讯　据美联社纽约消息：联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德22日催促以色列允许联合国紧急部队观察员进入加沙地区。以色列军队11月12日在这一地区的拉法曾经杀死了约五十名巴勒斯坦阿拉伯难民。
    哈马舍尔德发表了给以色列外交部长果尔达·梅厄夫人的一封信，信中重复了早些时候的请求，即允许联合国观察员“进入、驻在加沙地区并且在该地区内执行任务”。
