    "Fresh Rehmannia Root" Can Substitute Chinese Medicine "Rehmannia Root"
    Hebei Province is Massively Collecting and Purchasing
    (Our dispatch) The Chinese medicine "Rehmannia Root" is one of the most widely used in traditional Chinese medicine. In recent years, due to insufficient production, the supply has been tight for a long time, seriously affecting the efficacy of traditional Chinese medicine.

    The Baoding Prefectural Office of the Hebei Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative, after researching with the Hebei Provincial Traditional Chinese Medicine Clinic and the Baoding Pharmaceutical Company Processing Factory, found that using "fresh Rehmannia root" to replace "Rehmannia root" for medical treatment has basically the same curative effect.

    The Hebei Provincial pharmaceutical purchasing departments have begun to purchase "fresh Rehmannia root" in large quantities. According to statistics from Mancheng, Qingyuan, Tangxian, Anguo, and Dingxian, more than 52,000 jin of "fresh Rehmannia root" have been purchased.

    “鲜生地”可代中药“生地”
    河北省正大量采集和收购
    本报讯　中药材“生地”是中医应用最广的一种。几年来由于生产不足，长期供应紧张，严重地影响了中医的疗效。
    河北省供销社保定专区办事处，经与河北省中医门诊部、保定市药材公司加工厂研究，发现以“鲜生地”代替“生地”医病，疗效基本相同。
    河北省药材收购部门已开始大量收购“鲜生地”。据满城、清苑、唐县、安国、定县统计，已收购“鲜生地”五万二千多斤。
