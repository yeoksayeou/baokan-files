    The crisis of power fuel in Western European countries has become more acute due to the British and French aggression against Egypt, which has resulted in the interruption of oil supplies from the Middle East. Many Western European countries are already experiencing a shortage of oil, and they are extremely afraid that the lack of oil will force industries to shut down, thereby causing huge damage to their economies.
    Western Europe was originally a region rich in coal, a power fuel, and even exported it before the Second World War. However, this situation has changed greatly after the war. Instead, Western Europe has to import large quantities of coal and rely more and more on oil imports. According to the report of the "experts" of the U.S. Economic Cooperation Administration for Europe, in 1948 the energy (including coal and oil) imported by Western Europe accounted for only 12.8% of the total consumption, but by 1955 it had increased to 20%.
    The coal production of Western European countries has indeed decreased since the war. According to the United Nations "Monthly Bulletin of Statistics" in the fifth issue of 1954, Western Europe produced 488.5 million tons of coal in 1937 before the war. After the war, from 1951 to 1953, the average annual output was only 472.2 million tons, a decrease of 16.3 million tons. The countries with significant reductions are the United Kingdom, Italy, and the Netherlands. The average annual coal production of the United Kingdom from 1951 to 1953 decreased by 15.1 million tons compared with the production in 1937; Italy also decreased by 500,000 tons during the same period compared with the production in 1937; the Netherlands decreased by 1.9 million tons.
    What's going on here? First, let's look at the reasons for the decline in coal production in Western Europe. After the war, the "Western European Coal and Steel Community," organized by Western European monopoly capital under the manipulation of the United States, and the influx of cheap coal from the United States into Western Europe, greatly damaged the production of Western European coal mines. Because according to the provisions of the "Community" regulations, this organization has the right to decide on the production, investment, prices, and even the closure of mines in the member countries, making it easier for the United States to manipulate the production and market of Western European coal mines. For example, in Belgium, due to its participation in this "Community," one-third of the mines were forced to close under the pretext of "not making money," hoping to import cheap coal from the Ruhr, which is controlled by American capital. In Italy, coal imported from the United States almost completely controlled the Italian coal market. At the same time, the Italian government also complied with the will of foreign monopoly capital and stopped the loan rights of small and medium-sized mines, causing many small and medium-sized mines to close, so that coal production after the war decreased by 24% compared with before the war. In France, when the development of military industry urgently needed coal after the war, the government's Coal Administration closed many small mines and infiltrated capital into other European coal mining industries, estimated to account for about 12%-15% of coal mining capital in Belgium, about 10%-11% in West Germany, and about 8%-10% in the Netherlands. Before the war, the United Kingdom was a coal-exporting country, but after the war, it was squeezed out by the "Community" and competed with cheap American coal, and gradually lost the coal markets of Denmark, Italy, France, and Sweden. Taking 1950 as an example, coal exports to these regions decreased by 33% compared with 1937, and at the same time, 2 million tons of cheap coal was imported from the United States. West Germany is a country rich in coal, but its industry has not been able to fully enjoy the coal from the Ruhr, and has to obey the will of American monopoly capital to export it to Atlantic countries. These situations show that after the war, due to the infiltration and control of American monopoly capital, the coal mine production of Western European countries was strongly squeezed out and fell into decline.
    In addition, Western European coal mining capital has not carried out the renewal of production tools since the war, resulting in the backwardness of mining technology, and the poor working conditions and low wages have made it impossible to improve productivity. According to the "Belgian National" published in October 1950, in Belgium, taking August 1950 as an example, the output of a miner's one-day work was 680 kilograms of coal, only 90% of the output in 1938. Moreover, coal mining monopolists are unwilling to improve even normal operating conditions in order to maintain and increase their profits. For example, in West Germany, in 1950, the capital provided only 234 cubic feet of working prop wood for coal mines per month, a decrease of 16% compared with 1948.
    The production and consumption of power fuel in Western Europe in 1955 has revealed the serious problems existing in power fuel. According to the report of the "experts" of the U.S. Economic Cooperation Administration for Europe, the energy production in Europe in 1955 was 580 million tons of coal equivalent (including other energy fuels such as oil besides coal), while Western Europe consumed 730 million tons of coal equivalent in the same year. The difference of more than 150 million tons of coal equivalent is mainly made up by the import of 24 million tons of coal from the United States, 4.5 million tons of coal from other regions (mainly Eastern Europe), 8 million tons of coal equivalent of petroleum products, and 109 million tons of coal equivalent of crude oil. However, these four imports cost Western European countries as much as 1.85 billion U.S. dollars in foreign exchange, plus 750 million U.S. dollars in transportation costs, totaling 2.6 billion U.S. dollars. This huge amount of foreign exchange is obviously difficult for Western European countries to bear. At the same time, there is also a situation that the industry of Western European capitalist countries has gradually changed many power machines from using coal to using oil due to the renewal of production tools to a certain extent after the war. According to reports, in the energy consumption of Western Europe in 1948, coal still accounted for 79%, and oil only accounted for 13.2%, but by 1955, this ratio had been changed to 70% and 17%. However, Western Europe is not a region rich in oil. The total annual oil production in Western Europe after the war was only more than 7 million tons, and the deficit was mainly imported from the United States, the Middle East and Near East, and other places.
    With the development of this situation and the further intensification of the instability of the capitalist economy, the energy fuel crisis facing Western Europe will become more and more serious. Regarding the figures of the production and consumption difference in Western Europe in this regard in the future, according to the estimates of the "experts" of the U.S. Economic Cooperation Administration for Europe, the energy fuel consumption of Western Europe will gradually increase to about double in the next 20 years, that is, the maximum consumption will be about 1.3 billion tons of coal equivalent. If the energy fuel production of Western Europe can increase from the current 500 million tons of coal equivalent to 755 million tons of coal equivalent by 1975, then the energy fuel deficit in Western Europe in the future will increase from the current 180 million tons of coal equivalent to about 500 million tons of coal equivalent.
    What to do? People immediately think of the most fashionable way, using atomic energy. However, American "experts" believe that starting from this aspect cannot solve the problem, because according to their calculations, at most only 80 million tons of coal equivalent can be obtained from atomic energy by 1975. So they still think about importing fuel from the United States, as if this is the only way. The calculation of this wishful thinking is: In the next 20 years, Western Europe can gradually import 50 million tons of coal, 80 million tons of coal equivalent of petroleum products, and 235 million tons of coal equivalent of crude oil (refined after being transported to Europe) from the United States every year. However, this huge number is still an extremely conservative number. If the increase in Western Europe's own energy fuel production fails to proceed smoothly, the foreign exchange anemia of Western European countries continues to develop, and problems occur in the oil sources in the Middle East and Near East and other colonies, then this difference will be more than this number. Now, based on this number, how much foreign exchange will be needed? If calculated according to the average price of coal imported by Western Europe in 1955, the imported energy fuel in 1975 will be worth as much as 8.7 billion U.S. dollars, and the transportation cost will be 5.2 billion U.S. dollars without calculation. This is certainly a terrible number for the Western European economy.
    The plan designed by the "experts" of the U.S. Economic Cooperation Administration for Europe to solve the energy fuel crisis in Western Europe is of course far from reassuring the people of Western European countries. This on the one hand shows the ambition of American monopoly capital to continue to expand to Western Europe, and at the same time shows how serious the consequences will be if Western European countries continue to unilaterally rely on the United States economically.
    Under this circumstance, Britain and France are trying their best to maintain their colonial rule in the Middle East so that they can continue to plunder Middle East oil. The reason why they want to take back the Suez Canal from Egypt at all costs and launch a war of aggression against Egypt is for this reason. But they miscalculated greatly.
    The entire Western Europe imports 90% of its oil from the Middle East, of which Britain and France also import about 45 million tons from the Middle East out of the more than 50 million tons of oil they need to import each year. Now all of this has been seriously affected by the interruption of navigation on the Suez Canal caused by the Anglo-French war of aggression against Egypt and the angry severance of oil supplies to Britain and France by the people of Middle Eastern countries. It is estimated that the United Kingdom's current oil reserves are only enough for two months. France's oil reserves can only maintain three months of consumption. Many countries have had to repeatedly reduce oil consumption. The British government has ordered 1,500 trucks to stop using oil, and Denmark has also ordered a 25% reduction in supply. Many Western European countries have already or are preparing to limit oil consumption.
    Now Western European countries are trying to import oil from the United States and Latin America to make up for it, and American oil monopoly capital is also vigorously preparing to seize the opportunity to make a fortune. However, the problem is that importing oil from the United States must be paid with much higher U.S. dollars, which is a huge burden for Western European countries, especially the dollar-scarce Britain. More importantly, if Western Europe relies on the United States in this major economic driving force, it will enable the United States to further control Western Europe.
    The energy fuel crisis in Western Europe, like other aspects of Western European economic development, can only be favorably resolved by breaking away from the control of the United States, strengthening economic exchanges and cooperation between Eastern and Western countries, and abandoning the outdated policy of suppressing national independence movements, and establishing equal and mutually beneficial economic relations with Middle Eastern countries on the basis of respecting their independent sovereignty.

    西欧动力燃料的危机
    阿竞
    西欧各国动力燃料的危机，由于英、法侵略埃及，招致了中东石油来源的中断，而更为尖锐化。西欧许多国家已经发生石油不足的恐慌，它们极其害怕由于缺少石油而迫使工业停顿，从而使它们的经济遭到巨大的危害。
    西欧原是盛产动力燃料煤的地区，而且在第二次世界大战前一直向外输出。但是这个情况在战后有了极大的变化，西欧反而要从外面输入大量的煤，并要越来越多地依靠石油的进口。据美国欧洲经济合作总署“专家们”报道，在1948年西欧输入的动能（包括煤和石油）只占全部消费量的12.8％，但到1955年已经增加到20％了。
    战后西欧国家的产煤量确实比战前减少了。据联合国1954年第五期的“联合国统计月报”上载：战前1937年西欧共产煤四亿八千八百五十万吨，战后从1951年至1953年平均每年只产四亿七千二百二十万吨，减少了一千六百三十万吨。其中有显著的减少的国家为英国、意大利与荷兰。英国1951年至1953年每年平均煤产量与1937年的产量相比较，减少了一千五百一十万吨；意大利在同时期也比1937年的产量减少了五十万吨；荷兰减少了一百九十万吨。
    这是怎么一回事呢？首先看看西欧煤矿减产的原因吧。战后，在美国的操纵下西欧垄断资本所组织的“西欧煤钢联营”和美国的廉价煤源源向西欧输入，使西欧煤矿的生产受到了很大的损害。因为根据“联营”条例的规定，这个机构是有权决定联营国家煤矿的生产、投资、价格，甚至封闭矿井的，这样美国便更易于操纵西欧煤矿的生产和市场了。例如在比利时，由于参加了这个“联营”，有三分之一的矿井在“不赚钱”的借口下被强迫封闭，而指望向美国资本控制下的鲁尔输入廉价的煤。在意大利，由美国输入的煤几乎完全控制了意大利的煤市场，同时意大利政府还顺从外国垄断资本的意志停止了中小矿场的贷款权利，使许多中小矿井停闭，以致战后煤矿的产量比战前减少了24％。法国在战后由于军事工业的发展而迫切需要用煤的时候，却通过政府的煤炭管理局封闭了许多小矿井，把资本渗到其他欧洲的煤矿业中去，估计在比利时约占煤矿资本的12％—15％，在西德约占10％—11％，在荷兰约占8％—10％。英国在战前原是输出煤炭的国家，但战后因受到“联营”的排挤和美国廉价煤的竞争，已逐渐失去了丹麦、意大利、法国和瑞典的煤市场，以1950年为例，输往这些地区的煤就比1937年减少了33％，同时还向美国输入了二百万吨的廉价煤。西德是盛产煤的国家，其工业却未能充分享用鲁尔的煤，而要听命于美国垄断资本的意志向大西洋国家输出。这些情况表明，战后由于美国垄断资本的渗入和控制，西欧各国的煤矿生产遭受到强力的排挤，而陷于萎缩不振。
    另外，战后西欧煤矿资本没有进行生产工具的更新，以致采煤业的技术落后，而且劳动条件恶劣，工资低微，而使生产率不能提高。据1950年10月出版的“比利时国家”上载：在比利时，以1950年8月为例，一个矿工一日工作的产量为六百八十公斤的煤，只抵1938年产量的90％。而且煤矿业垄断资本家为了保持和增加自己的利润，甚至连正常的作业条件也不愿改善。例如在西德，1950年资方供给煤矿井的作业支柱木每月只二百三十四立方尺，比1948年减少了16％。
    1955年西欧动力燃料的生产和消费情况，已显示了动力燃料所存在的严重问题。据美国欧洲经济合作总署的“专家们”的报道，1955年欧洲动能生产量为五亿八千万吨煤当量（其中包括除煤以外的其他动能燃料如石油等），而同年西欧却消费了七亿三千万吨的煤当量。这一亿五千余万吨煤当量的差额主要是由美国输入煤二千四百万吨，其他地区输入煤四百五十万吨（主要是东欧），石油产品八百万吨煤当量，原油一亿零九百万吨煤当量来弥补的。可是这四项输入却花费了西欧国家的外汇达十八亿五千万美元，加上运输费七亿五千万美元，共合二十六亿美元。这巨大数字的外汇，显然是西欧国家所难以负担的。同时还有一种情况，这就是战后西欧资本主义国家的工业由于在一定程度上进行了生产工具的更新，已有许多动力机器逐渐由使用煤炭而改为使用石油。据报道，西欧在1948年的动能消费中，煤仍占79％，石油只占13.2％，但到1955年，这比例已改为70％与17％了。但是西欧并不是盛产石油的地区，战后西欧石油每年的总产量只七百余万吨，不敷之数主要是由美国、中近东等地输入。
    随着这种情况的发展和资本主义经济的不稳定的进一步加剧，西欧所面临的动力燃料的危机当愈来愈严重。关于今后西欧在这方面的生产和消费差额的数字，据美国欧洲经济合作总署的“专家们”的估计，西欧在二十年内的动能燃料消费量将逐步增加至一倍左右，即最大消费量约达十三亿吨煤当量。如果西欧的动能燃料生产能由目前的五亿多吨煤当量到1975年增加至七亿五千五百万吨煤当量的话，那么今后西欧每年不敷的动力燃料将由目前的一亿八千余万吨的煤当量增加到五亿吨煤当量左右。
    这怎么办呢？人们立刻想到最时髦的办法，利用原子能。但是美国的“专家们”认为从这方面着手还不能解决问题，因为据他们计算到1975年从原子能方面最多只能得到八千万吨的煤当量。于是他们还是从美国输入燃料方面着想，好像这是唯一的办法。这个如意算盘的计算是：二十年内西欧每年可从美国逐步输入五千万吨煤，石油产品八千万吨煤当量，石油原油（运到欧洲之后再提炼）二亿三千五百万吨煤当量。可是，这巨大的数字还是极其保守的数字，如果西欧本身动力燃料的增产未能顺利进行，西欧各国的外汇贫血病继续发展，中近东及其他殖民地的石油来源发生了问题的话，那么这个差额还不止此数。现在就以这个数字来计算，所需的外汇究竟要多少呢？如果根据1955年西欧输入煤的平均价格来计算，1975年的入口动能燃料当共值八十七亿美元之巨，运费不算也得要五十二亿美元。这对于西欧的经济来说当然是一个可怕的数字。
    美国欧洲经济合作总署的“专家们”所设计的解决西欧动力燃料危机的这个方案，当然远不能使西欧各国的人士安心。这一方面显示了美国垄断资本继续向西欧扩张的野心，同时也显示了西欧各国在经济上继续单方面地依赖美国，将会造成多末严重的后果。
    在这种情况下，英法竭力企图保持在中东的殖民统治，使它们得以继续掠夺中东石油。它们所以不顾一切地想从埃及手里夺回苏伊士运河，并发动了对埃及的侵略战争，就是由于这样的原因。但它们大大失算了。
    整个西欧有90％的石油进口来自中东，其中英法两国每年所需要进口的五千多万吨石油中也有四千五百万吨左右来自中东。现在这一切都由于英法侵埃战争引起的苏伊士运河航行的中断和中东各国人民愤怒切断了对英法石油供应而受到了严重的影响。据估计，英国现有石油储备量只够两个月之用。法国的存油也只能维持三个月的消费。许多国家不得不一再削减石油用量，英国政府并命令一千五百辆卡车停止使用，丹麦也命令减少25％的供应量。许多西欧国家也已经或准备限制石油消费量。
    现在西欧国家正想从美国和拉丁美洲进口石油来加以弥补，美国石油垄断资本也在起劲地准备乘机大捞一把。但是问题是从美国进口石油必须用高昂得多的美元去支付，这对西欧国家特别是美元荒的英国是一个极大的负担，更重要的是，如果西欧在这个主要经济动力方面依靠美国，这将会使美国更进一步地控制西欧。
    西欧动力燃料的危机，正像西欧经济发展的其他方面的问题一样，只有摆脱美国的控制，加强东西方各国间经济交流和合作，并放弃镇压民族独立运动的过时政策，在尊重中东国家的独立主权的基础上同它们建立平等互惠的经济关系，才能取得有利的解决。
