Driving Sheep Ten Thousand Li
By our Special Correspondent Xiao Qian

(Continued from yesterday)

The enthusiasm of Inner Mongolian cadres alone isn't enough to overcome so many difficulties. In this epic poem of driving sheep across the Tianshan Mountains, nothing is more moving than the deep friendship between the various brotherly ethnic groups. Along the way, as long as they heard it was the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region government sending people to buy breeding sheep, this explanation itself was the most effective "passport." No request was too great for the Kazakh people; they were willing to offer anything.

On June 27th, they arrived in the Alatau region of the Yili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture. Umuer was not very familiar with this section of the road, so they needed a temporary guide; the district government searched for a long time but couldn't find one. At this moment, a young Kazakh man came down from the mountains, a cloth wrapped around his head, looking quite strong, his name was Akbar. They told him their story. This young man was probably very filial, he said, "Okay, let me go back and talk to my father." Everyone followed him. The young man's yurt was set up on the bank of the Gongnaisi River, where the trees were so large that two people couldn't wrap their arms around them. The old man, seeing the rare guests, immediately brought out mare's milk to invite everyone to drink. Hearing that they wanted his son to lead the way, the old man said, "My boy recently broke his saddle and fell off his horse during 'sheep snatching' (a game among the Kazakhs), he suffered a concussion, and I haven't let him do any strenuous work. But you are doing work for our government, and he can't refuse no matter how sick he is. He must see you off."

When they were leaving, the old man saw that the horses of the transport team were carrying too much weight, and he even pulled out two of his own horses and said, "Take these and use them!" Then he brought two leather bags of milk, each able to hold forty or fifty pounds. He said, "I don't have anything good, take this with you to drink on the road!"

How far did this young man guide them? A full eight days. When they tried to give him some money as they parted, look how anxious he was! He blushed and said, "No, no, my father told me when he left that I must not accept a single penny from you!"

There are too many stories of people helping them draw route maps, guiding them, and sending walnuts, mare's milk, and milk wine along the way. Once, when veterinarian Wen Qing was crossing a river, there happened to be a child of eight or nine years old by the river, leading a child of four or five. Seeing them, the two little ones ran away. They thought they had scared them, but before long, the older one came back shyly, carrying a bucket of mare's milk in one hand and a teacup in the other. Wen Qing drank several cups at once. The child also pointed forward with his little finger, meaning that he should call his companions to drink as well.

When the team reached Zhagen Zhoulou, the meat sheep they had brought with them (of course, they couldn't eat the breeding sheep) were all eaten. At this time, they saw a yurt in the distance and went inside. The owner's name was Geng Ke. This was the Mongolian region within Xinjiang, so they could communicate with each other. When the old man heard that they needed two sheep, he said, "Choose any sheep from my flock." They chose two of the fattest ones, preparing to take them on the road the next day.

Early the next morning, the old man invited them to drink. There must be a reason for offering drinks at this hour. The old man cupped his hands in apology and said, "Everyone, I'm very sorry, I, the old man, must apologize to you first. Last night I promised that you could choose any sheep, but I didn't expect that the government's livestock tax collectors would come. I, the old man, have never broken my word, but now that the government tax collectors have come, the fattest sheep must be given to Chairman Mao before I can give them to my guests. I ask you to put the chosen sheep back in the pen, and after we pay the tax, you can choose any of the remaining sheep."

To express his sincere apology, the old man also brought a basket of mare's milk, a basket of milk wine, and a basket of milk, he insisted that all thirty-odd members of the team drink their fill. The old man watched everyone drink, filled with happiness, muttering to himself, "I don't have anything else good, just this little token of my appreciation!"

Then, he asked Hadi very seriously about the situation of agricultural cooperation in Inner Mongolia, how many cooperatives there were now, how mutual aid teams were transformed into cooperatives, how livestock were incorporated into the cooperatives, and so on. When they left, the old man repeatedly asked him not to forget to send him a copy of the articles of association when he returned.

This deep ethnic friendship is not one-sided.

On the second day after leaving the sheep farm, they were passing through a snake-infested area, walking anxiously through waist-high grass, with no water to drink, but they still had to shout loudly, otherwise the sheep might get lost. It was already nine o'clock in the evening when they reached the campsite, and people were so tired that their bones felt like they were about to fall apart.

At this moment, a Kazakh old man ran over, saying that his daughter-in-law was having a difficult labor, the baby was born, but the placenta was still inside the mother. In fact, there were only veterinarians in the team, no doctors. But the old man had run so far, could they let him go back disappointed? No. Xin Zhongzhi, who had already leaned over from exhaustion, stood up without a word, slung his medical kit over his shoulder, and left. How far did he go? A full thirty li of mountain road round trip, returning at a little after one o'clock in the middle of the night. But they had to set off again at three o'clock.

From then on, Umuer probably told everyone they met that there was a "famous doctor" among them, and many people along the way asked them to treat their illnesses. They gave many Kazakh villagers penicillin and left behind anti-inflammatory pills. No matter how tired people were, no matter how bad the road was, they never refused a single time.

With such a life-or-death fighting friendship, parting was certainly not an easy thing. But they had safely arrived in Urumqi and had to part ways. The old worker Umuer had a home in Urumqi. When they parted, he left his address and invited everyone to come to his house for a meal. But after nearly fifty days of travel, everyone was too lazy to even get up after lying down. At eleven o'clock in the evening, Umuer ran over, his eyes red, and said angrily, "I slaughtered a big, fat sheep, especially waiting for you, until this hour, why haven't you come yet? If you still consider Umuer as a person, then come!"

Hearing this, no matter how tired they were, they had to go.

It turned out that Umuer and his father had invited all their Kazakh relatives and friends to the yurt, waiting all evening, he wanted them to meet his close Inner Mongolian brothers as well. A large iron pot was burning in the center of the yurt, the aroma of meat filled the air, the sheep had already been cooked thoroughly, just waiting to be cut.

So, come on! Thus, they played guessing games, toasted, and revelled for two full nights.

When the team was approaching Urumqi, the director of the Animal Husbandry Department of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, who had arrived earlier by car from Yili, came seventeen or eighteen li outside the city to meet them. The director suggested that everyone take turns going into the city to rest. In fact, after such a hard journey, this was very appropriate. But no one was willing to leave, saying: "Nothing went wrong with the sheep along the way, let's just be extra careful until the end."

How did some people get into the city later? In order to load the sheep, some wooden frames had to be nailed to the top of the trucks to prevent the sheep from jumping off the trucks halfway. After consulting with a carpenter, it would cost twenty-five yuan per truck; wouldn't that be another thousand yuan or more? The director picked up an axe and said, "Okay, let's buy some wood and nail it ourselves."

The director worked very enthusiastically. He was fat, and people at the bus station, because they didn't know he was the director, all called him "Fatty Master." One day, someone at the station who liked to inquire asked Hadi in a low voice, "Hey, where did you find this Fatty Master? He's working so hard! How much does he earn a month?" Hadi told him the director's salary. He said, "What, is the salary of a carpenter in Inner Mongolia so high?" Hadi then said, "Our carpenter is the director."

Fifty trucks, each equipped with a person in charge, set off in a mighty convoy from Urumqi to Jiuquan, the starting point of the railway.

Once on the trucks, were the hardships all over? Not at all.

Sheep are not like cargo, tied to the truck and everything is fine. The trucks traveled for seven days, and the sheep had to be loaded and unloaded seven times. When the truck was moving, the person in charge of the sheep was like a teacher at a school for naughty children, having to watch over them at all times, lest the naughty sheep cause a ruckus, and if there was chaos, the weak sheep would be crushed to death. Some sheep suffered heatstroke and couldn't drink water. What to do? The people in charge of the sheep used their hats to give them water. When the truck stopped, they were even busier, first having to find a place to graze them. Doing this, people couldn't sleep on the road.

To avoid the sheep eating the crops of the common people, it was not good to stop wherever there were shops or people's homes, so they had to stop in the wilderness. But when they arrived in Jiuquan, the sky and earth were gray, and all they could see was the Gobi Desert, they couldn't find a trace of grass even after riding a horse for twenty li. The sheep were bleating from hunger, nibbling on the clothes of the people in charge, some even unable to make a sound. The workers hugged the bleating sheep and said, "Poor things, what can I do even if you call out to me!"

That evening, an old man in his fifties stood by the truck team with his hands behind his back, watching. This old man looked like an expert, he probably really liked these fine wool sheep. Watching, he sighed and said, "Where can you find such beautiful sheep!" Hearing that they had been driven down from the Tianshan Mountains, the old man was even more surprised. But he said, "If you don't feed them soon, the sheep will die."

Team leader Hadi quickly stepped forward and gave a salute and said, "We are also worried about this! Do you have any ideas?" The old man said his name was Ma Luosang, and he was the deputy county head of the autonomous county here. Hadi invited him into the tent. The old man said, "There is a pasture near Wenshu Temple, come, I'll write you a letter, you can just tell them at the district office." The old man also asked about the situation in Inner Mongolia with great concern, saying that although he had not been there, he had heard the relayed reports from visiting delegations.

Hadi tucked the letter of introduction into his clothes, mounted his horse, and hurried with the leader of the sheep-driving team straight to Wenshu Temple. He was so happy all the way! The district government was in a large temple on the mountain. District Head Liu, seeing them, was extremely happy and told people to move them into a large temple on the mountain to live.

District Head Liu said, "This year there is little rain, and the grass is dry. Some herders here can't find grass either. We have some good grass in this mountain valley, and we originally wanted to allocate it to the herders here. You are guests from afar, let you use it first, I will notify the herders to come a few days later."

In this way, the hungry sheep were driven to the pasture of Wenshu Temple, they ate for three full days and nights, and the weight they had lost was finally regained.

In Jiuquan, the railway allocated twenty-two freight cars for them, loading them up and down for a full thirty-six hours. They bought through tickets, which would pass through five main lines: Lanxin, Longhai, Jinghan, Jingbao, and Jier, without needing to change trains at all. This should be more comfortable, right? Who knew it wouldn't be so.

Wasn't this summer particularly hot? They were sitting in closed cars, and the people were so hot that they had no energy, and the sheep had not closed their mouths for eleven days since getting on the train. One by one, they were drooping their tongues, stomping their hooves restlessly.

A sheep needs to drink about five kilograms of water a day, but some stations have water, and some don't. Also, according to the train schedule, they could reach Saihantala Station in Xilin Gol League in seven days, but forty freight cars were needed to form a train, and twenty-two freight cars were not enough for a train, so it took eleven days with delays and travel. This was serious. They had only prepared ten days' worth of dry grass for the sheep!

So, as long as the train stopped, even if it was only for ten or twenty minutes, everyone would go their separate ways to find ways to help the sheep. Some would pull back an armful of grass, pulling until their hands were bleeding. Some would carry buckets that could hold thirty pounds of water and go twenty or thirty li away to get water for the sheep to drink.

The sheep, however, did not know the hardships, they still butted each other in the closed cars, and the weak ones always couldn't get any grass. They had to think of a way. They tied the grass into small bundles and hung them on all sides of the closed cars, scattered the sheep, and told them to jump to eat, so that they could feed the weak ones separately.

Some timid sheep wouldn't drink water when everyone crowded together, and if they didn't drink, they would gradually lose their strength, so they had to think of a way. The cadres used their own quilts to separate the sheep that wouldn't drink water, and then used their own water cups to feed them bit by bit. Holding the cup in the closed car, they squatted for three or four hours. The naughty sheep even butted them under the quilts with their horns.

In this way, several sheep still fell ill.

The weather was particularly hot on the day they passed through Zhengzhou. They had never been discouraged when passing through the precipitous cliffs and snake-infested Great Snow Mountains. But when they arrived in Zhengzhou, several sheep fell ill, and they were more frustrated than ever. Everyone was crestfallen.

At this time, an old man with a leisurely expression came to the freight yard, he seemed to dislike the smell. But he was curious about these twenty-odd freight cars of sheep, so he covered his nostrils with a snow-white handkerchief and walked over. He saw that these people were covered in sheep dung pellets and said a sentence, this sentence hurt everyone's heart. He said, "Hey, what can't you do, why do you have to do this job?" Hadi was sad because the sheep were sick, he glared at the old man fiercely and said, "Have you ever worn woolen serge in your life? We want everyone in the country to wear woolen serge, that's why we're doing this job!"

On that day, one sheep died. They gave it penicillin for a day, but it didn't save it. After the sheep died, the veterinarian dissected it and found that its lungs were originally rotten, and it had suffered heatstroke, which caused it to die.

But that was the only day the whole team was in low spirits.

In the Tianshan Mountains, a Xinjiang villager who saw them transporting big carts on the cliff side said: "Oh, everything has changed since the Communist Party came, even the stones of the Tianshan Mountains are giving way to you."

Some people also said: "The stones of the Tianshan Mountains are hard, but the cadres of the Communist Party are even harder than stones."

When the sheep were weighed in Urumqi, a Kazakh old man said: "Hey, the sheep have gained weight, but you have lost weight, your meat has grown on the sheep."

In Hohhot, when the team members held an appraisal meeting, one comrade jokingly said: "We risked our lives to transport these sheep, I think our main aspect is merit." The other team members heard this, one by one stood up and solemnly said: "The stones of the Tianshan Mountains didn't stop us, and we can't let complacency stop us. Next time we transport sheep, we must transport them even better than this time." (The End)

    万里赶羊
    本报特约记者　萧乾
    （续昨）
    单靠内蒙古干部的工作热情，还克服不了这么多困难。在这首天山赶羊的诗篇里，比什么都动人的是各兄弟民族之间深厚的友谊。一路上只要听说是内蒙古自治区政府为了改进畜牧业派来买种羊的，这个说明本身就是最吃得开的“护照”。怎么样的要求对于哈萨克人都不是太大的，他们什么都可以拿出来。
    6月27日那天，他们走到伊犁哈萨克自治州的阿拉图地区。那一段路乌木耳不大熟，需要一位临时的响导；区政府替他们找了半天没找到。这时候恰巧山里头来了个哈萨克小伙子，头上扎着块布，样子看来挺壮，名字叫阿克巴尔。他们把原由告诉了他。这小伙子大概十分孝顺，他说：“成，等我回去跟我爸爸说说去。”大家也跟着他去了。小伙子的蒙古包就扎在巩乃斯河的岸上，那里的树大得两个人也抱不过来。老汉瞧见来了稀客，立刻端出马奶子来请大家喝。听到要叫他儿子去领路，老汉说：“我这小子新近抢羊（哈萨克人中间的一种游戏）的时候，马鞍子坏了，从马上摔了下来，脑袋受了振动，我一直不大让他干什么吃力的活儿。可是你们各位做的是咱们政府工作，随他怎么病也不能推辞。一定要送一送。”
    走的时候，老汉看到驮运组的马身上压得太重了，还拉出自己的两匹马来说，你们拿去用吧！然后又提了两皮口袋的奶子，每个总能盛上四五十斤。他说，我没什么好东西，这个你们带去路上喝吧！
    这小伙子送了多少路程呢？送了整整八天的路。临分手塞给他点钱，瞧他这个着急劲儿！他涨红着脸说：“不，不，爸爸走的时候嘱咐了，绝不能收你们一个钱！”
    一路上替他们画路线图的，带路的，送胡桃、马奶子、牛奶酒的，说起来太多了。兽医文清有一回过河的时候，河边上刚好有个八九岁的孩子，手里还领着个四五岁的。瞧见他们，两个小家伙跑掉了。他们还以为是吓跑了呢，谁知道过不大一会儿，那个大的一手提了桶马奶子，一手拿着个茶杯，羞答答地走过来了。文清一会喝了好几杯。孩子还用小手指了指前边，意思是要他把同行的伙伴也叫来喝。
    大队走到扎根朱娄地方，随身带的肉羊（他们当然不能吃种羊）吃光了。这时候，远远望见个蒙古包，就走进去。主人名叫耿珂。这是新疆境里的蒙古族地区了，所以他们彼此可以通话。这位老汉听说他们需要两只羊，就说：“我圈里的羊，随你们挑吧。”他们就挑了两只顶肥的，准备第二天牵上路。
    第二天大清早，老汉请他们喝酒。这个时辰请喝酒，必然有个原由。老汉拱手很抱歉地说：“诸位，很对不起呀，我老汉先向你们赔礼。昨天晚上我答应随你们挑，我没料到政府收畜牧税的人会来。我老汉从来没失过信，可是现在政府收税的人来了，顶肥的羊我得给毛主席，然后才能给客人。我要求你们把挑好的搁在圈里，等我们纳完了税，剩下的羊随你们挑。”
    老汉为了表示衷心的歉意，还提了一筲子马奶子、一筲子牛奶酒和一筲子牛奶，他一定要大队三十几个人每个人都喝足。老汉一边儿望着大家喝，一边充满了幸福地自言自语着：“没别的好东西，就是这么点心意！”
    然后，他很认真地向哈迪打听内蒙古牧业合作化的情况，现在一共有多少个社，互助组是怎么转社的，牲口怎么入社等等。走的时候老汉再三托付他说，回去不论怎么样也别忘记给他寄一份章程来。
    这种深厚的民族友谊并不是单方面的。
    从羊场出发的第二天，过的正是毒蛇区，一路上提心吊胆地走过没腰的草，没有水喝，可还得大声吆喝着，不然羊就可能走失。到了宿营地已经晚上九点了，人累得骨架都快散了。
    这当儿，一个哈萨克老汉跑来，说他家儿媳妇难产，娃娃生下来，胎盘还在产妇肚子里头。其实，队里只有兽医，并没有大夫。但是老汉这么远跑来，能叫人家失望着回去吗？不能。已经歪下身子的辛仲直没有二句话，站起来，背上腰包就走。走多远呢？来回足有三十里山路，到半夜一点多才回来。可是三点钟就又得出发。
      从那以后，大概乌木耳见人就宣传他们中间有“名医”，一路上不少人要求他们治病。他们给许多哈萨克老乡打了盘尼西林，留下了消炎片。不论人多么累，路多么不好走，他们从来没拒绝过一次。
    有这样一场出死入生的战斗友谊，分手当然不是件容易的事。可是，他们已经平安到达了乌鲁木齐，非分手不可了。那个老工人乌木耳在乌鲁木齐有家。分手的时候，他留下了地址，约大家到他家去吃吃东西。可是将近五十天的旅行，每个人躺下都懒得爬起来了。到晚上十一点，乌木耳两眼通红地跑来，很恼火地说：“我宰了只大肥羊，专诚等了你们，一直到这个时辰，你们怎么还不来？如果你们还把乌木耳当作人看的话，那么就来吧。”
    这么一说，怎么累也只好去喽。
    原来乌木耳和他的老爹把他们哈萨克亲友全邀到包里来，直直等了一个晚上，他要他们也见见他这些亲密的内蒙古弟兄。包中央烧着个大铁锅，香喷喷的肉味，那只羊早已煮得通熟，就等着下刀了。
    那么，来吧！于是，猜拳呀，干杯呀，足足狂欢了两夜。
    大队快到乌鲁木齐的时候，先从伊犁搭汽车到达的内蒙古自治区的畜牧处处长走到城外头十七八里来迎接他们。处长提议大家轮流进城休息休息。其实这么辛苦的旅行，这是很应该的。可是大家谁也不肯走开，说：一路上羊都没出点乱子，还是求个万全吧。
    后来有些人怎么进的城呢？为了装羊，卡车上头得钉些木架子，免得羊半道上窜下车去。找木工一核计，一辆车得花二十五元；不又是一千多元吗？处长抄起斧子来说，好，咱们买点木料，自己来钉。
    处长干得非常起劲。他身体胖，汽车站上的人因为不晓得他是处长，大家都叫他“胖师傅”。一天站上有个好打听事情的人小声问哈迪说：“嗨，你们这位胖师傅是哪儿找来的呀，这么不要命地干？他一个月挣多少钱呀？”哈迪就把处长的薪金数目告诉了他。他说，“怎么，内蒙古的木匠工资有这么高？”哈迪这当儿才说，咱们这位木匠是处长。
    五十辆卡车，每辆车都配备好了负责人，就浩浩荡荡从乌鲁木齐向火车的起点酒泉出发了。
    上了汽车，磨难是不是就都过去了呢？才不是呢。
    羊不像货物，捆到车上就没事啦。汽车走七天，羊就得装卸七次。车走的时候，管羊的人就像个顽童学校的教员，时刻得照看着，别让调皮的羊起哄，一乱就会发生弱羊被压死的事。有些羊中了暑，喝不下去水。怎么办呢？管羊的用帽子装给它们喝。车停的时候就更忙了，先得找地方牧放。这么搞，人在路上是睡不到觉的。
    为了怕羊吃老百姓的庄稼，凡是有店、有人家的地方，反而不好停，一定要停到野外。可是到了酒泉，灰天灰地，举目都是戈壁滩，骑马走出二十多里也找不到一点草影儿。羊饿得咩咩叫着，啃管羊人的衣服，有的甚至叫不出声来了。工人搂着咩咩叫的羊说：“可怜呀，怎么叫我也没办法呀！”
    这天晚上，有个五十多岁的老汉背着手，站在汽车队旁边观望。这位老汉一看就是个行家，他大概很喜欢这种细毛羊。望着望着，他叹了气说：“这么标致的羊，哪儿找去呀！”听说是从天山上赶下来的，老汉更惊讶了。可是他说，你们要是再不喂，羊就要死啦。
    领队哈迪赶紧上前行了个礼说：“我们正在为这件事着急哪！您有什么办法吗？”老汉说，他叫马洛桑，是这里自治县的副县长。哈迪就把他请到帐篷里去。老汉说：“文殊庙那边有块牧场，来，我给你们写封信，你们到区上一说就行啦。”老汉还很关切地问了问内蒙古的情形，说他虽然没到过那里，可是听到过参观访问团的传达报告。
    哈迪掖好介绍信，跨上马，赶紧跟赶羊组的组长照直奔文殊庙去了。一路这个开心呀！区政府是在山上一座大庙里。区长姓刘，看见他们高兴极了，就招呼人把他们搬到山上一座大庙里住。
    刘区长说：“今年雨水稀，草干了。这边也有些牧户找不到草。我们这山沟儿里倒是有些好草，本来想调剂调剂这里的牧户。你们是远客，尽你们先用吧，我通知牧户们晚几天来就是。”
    这样，饥饿的羊群赶到文殊庙的草场上来了，它们足足吃了三天三夜，掉的膘总算又长上了。
    在酒泉，铁路上给他们调来二十二个车皮，七上八下地足足装了三十六个钟头。买的是联运票，要经过兰新、陇海、京汉、京包、集二等五条干线，完全不需要换车。这下可舒服些了吧？谁知不然。
    今年夏天不是特别热吗？他们坐的是闷子车，人热得浑身没劲儿，羊从上火车，十一天就没闭上过嘴。它们一个个搭拉着舌头，烦躁得蹄子乱跺。
    一只羊一天要喝上大约五公斤水，可是有的车站有水，有的没有。还有，照行车表看，他们有七天就可以到锡林郭勒盟的赛汉塔拉站了，可是四十辆车皮才能编成一列车，二十二辆车皮够不上一列，结果连耽误带走要用十一天。这可严重了。他们只给羊准备了十天吃的干草呀！
    于是，火车只要一停，即便是一二十分钟，大家也分头想法替羊奔走。有的拔回一抱草来，拔得手上都出了血。有的提着能装三十斤水的桶，到二三十里地以外给羊弄水喝。
    羊呢，可不知道甘苦，它们在闷子车里照样顶来顶去，力气小的总吃不到草。又得想办法呗。他们把草捆成小把小把的，吊在闷子车的四面，把羊群散开，叫它们跳着吃，这样，就好单独喂那些力气小的了。
    有些胆小的羊，大家一挤，它就不喝水了，不喝慢慢就没了气力，又得想办法。干部用自己的被子把不喝水的羊隔开，然后再用自己喝水的缸子一点点地喂。端着缸子在闷子车里，一蹲就是三四个钟头。顽皮的羊还从被子底下用犄角顶撞着。
    就这么样，好几只羊还病倒了。
    过郑州那天，气候特别热。走过悬崖壁立，毒蛇遍地的大雪山的时候，他们从来没诅丧过。可是到了郑州，羊却病了几只，他们心里再懊丧没有了。每个人都垂头丧气的。
    这时候，货栈上来了个神色悠闲的老头儿，他好像很厌弃那股气味。可是又对这二十几辆车皮的羊感到好奇，就用雪白的手帕堵了鼻孔，走了过来。他望到这些人浑身滚的都是羊粪蛋儿，说了一句话，这句话可伤透了大家的心。他说：“喂，你们这几个什么不可以干，为什么单单要干这一行呢？”哈迪正在为了羊生病难过着，他狠狠地瞪了老头儿一眼说：“你这辈子穿过毛哔叽吗？我们是要全国人民都穿上毛哔叽，所以才干这一行的！”
    就在那天，死了一只羊。他们给它打了一天的盘尼西林，也没救活。羊死了以后，兽医把它解剖了，发现它的肺本来是烂的，又中了暑，才死的。
    可是那是全队唯一情绪低落的一天。
    在天山里，一个看见他们在悬崖边上运大车的新疆老乡说：哎唷，共产党一来，全变了，连天山的石头也给你们让路了。
    也有人说：天山的石头硬，可是共产党的干部比石头还要硬。
    羊在乌鲁木齐过秤的时候，一个哈萨克老汉说：咳，羊是长了膘，你们可瘦了，你们的肉长在羊身上了。
    在呼和浩特，当队员们开鉴定会的时候，有一个同志半开玩笑地说：咱们大家这回是冒了性命危险运来的羊，我觉得咱们主要的方面是优点。别的队员听了，一个个地都站起来，很严肃地表示：天山的石头没挡住咱们，更不能让自满情绪挡住咱们。下一回再去运羊，咱们一定要比这回运得更好。　（完）
