Xinhua News Agency, 18th - New York Dispatch: Indian representative to the United Nations, Lall, submitted a proposal to the United Nations General Assembly on November 17th, demanding that the Assembly declare invalid the decision passed on the 16th not to discuss the restoration of China's legitimate rights in the United Nations during the current session, because this decision was not approved by a two-thirds majority of member states.

India's proposal requests that the United Nations General Assembly decide: the question of Chinese representation is an important question, and according to the United Nations Charter regarding rules of procedure and convention, decisions on this question require a two-thirds majority, rather than a simple majority applicable to more minor questions.

During the vote on the 16th, only forty-five votes were cast against including the issue of Chinese representation proposed by India on the agenda of the General Assembly, and only forty-seven votes were cast against the current session of the Assembly discussing any proposal to exclude the Nationalist Party elements or allow representatives of the People's Republic of China to attend the Assembly. Both of these numbers are less than two-thirds of the United Nations General Assembly, which has seventy-nine members.

    印度再就中国代表权问题向联大提出提案
    要求宣布大会关于不讨论中国代表权问题的决定无效
    新华社18日讯　纽约消息：印度驻联合国代表拉尔11月17日向联合国大会提出一项提案，要求宣布大会在16日通过的关于在本届大会不讨论恢复中国在联合国中合法权利的决定为无效，因为这个决定没有得到三分之二的多数会员国的赞同。
    印度的提案要求联合国大会决定：中国代表权问题是一个重要问题，根据联合国宪章关于议事规则和程序的规定以及惯例，关于这个问题的决定需要有三分之二的多数，而不是适用于较为次要的问题的简单多数。
    在16日表决的时候，反对把印度提出的中国代表权问题列入大会议程的只有四十五票，反对本届大会讨论任何关于排斥国民党分子或者让中华人民共和国代表出席大会的提案的也只有四十七票，都不到拥有七十九个会员国的联合国大会的三分之二的多数。
