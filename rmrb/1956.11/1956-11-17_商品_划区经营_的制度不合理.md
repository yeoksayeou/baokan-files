    The "Zoned Management" System for Commodities is Unreasonable

    Wuyuan County is located in the northeast corner of Jiangxi Province, bordering Anhui and Zhejiang provinces. It is mountainous and inconvenient for transportation. According to the reasonable flow of commodities and transportation direction, some daily necessities in Wuyuan County should be imported from Zhejiang Province in the east. However, in recent years, state-owned commerce and supply and marketing cooperatives have implemented "centralized" management and "zoned purchase and sales" of commodities. Generally, commodities are transported from the west of Wuyuan, which is against the natural flow, resulting in roundabout transportation, increased commodity circulation costs, and higher selling prices. Take edible salt as an example. In the past, it was imported from Qu County. The wholesale price of each dan (a unit of weight, approximately 50 kg) of Zhejiang salt transported to Wuyuan was 13 yuan, 6 jiao, 6 fen, and 8 li. Now, Wuyuan must be supplied by Leping County in the province. Leping supplies Huai salt, which is black and coarse. The wholesale price per dan is 14 yuan, 2 jiao, 9 fen, and 4 li, which is 6 jiao, 2 fen, and 6 li more expensive than the former. The wholesale price of Double Coin brand rubber shoes in Qu County is 3 yuan, 5 jiao, and 1 fen per pair, and the wholesale price transported to Wuyuan is 3 yuan, 5 jiao, and 8 fen. However, Wuyuan's current supply point is Jingdezhen City, where the wholesale price is 3 yuan, 6 jiao, and 6 fen per pair, and the wholesale price upon arrival in Wuyuan is 3 yuan, 7 jiao, and 1 fen, a difference of 1 jiao and 3 fen. If the highway from Qu County to Wuyuan is fully repaired and converted to automobile transportation, the wholesale price of salt per dan will be reduced to 13 yuan and 8 fen, and the price of rubber shoes per pair will be reduced to 3 yuan, 5 jiao, and 6 fen.

    In order to consolidate this supply system, the commercial departments also stipulate that if retail units purchase goods from wholesale stations outside the vertical system, they will not be able to enjoy the internal allocation preferential treatment (5% price reduction) within the system.

    The state-owned commerce and supply and marketing cooperatives' procurement of agricultural, sideline, local, and special products is also carried out according to administrative divisions, so the purchase prices in various places are inconsistent and unreasonable. Especially in remote and backward areas, the lower the purchase price, the greater the loss for farmers. Generally speaking, the purchase price of commodities in Wuyuan County is much lower than in neighboring areas, and some are even so low that they do not cover production and transportation costs. For example, the supply and marketing cooperative in Wuyuan County purchases rosin based on the purchase price in Nanchang, deducting costs and profits at each level, and the purchase price per hundred jin is on average 38% lower than that in Wucheng Town, Xiuning County, Anhui. Another example is that the dial paper in Qingshi Township has always been sold to Hangzhou. If it is transported directly from the place of origin to Hangzhou according to the natural flow direction, the transportation cost per dan (about forty jin) of paper is only 1 yuan, 7 jiao, 2 fen, and 7 li. Now, the commercial department stipulates that this kind of paper is managed by the province and must be transported from the place of origin to the county seat, then back to Yingtan, and then to Hangzhou, and the transportation cost per dan increases to 3 yuan, 3 jiao, 5 fen, and 3 li. If we can change this unreasonable flow direction, we can save more than 20,000 yuan in transportation costs based on this year's planned total purchase of dial paper in the county.

    This unreasonable system must be changed. Comrade Chen Yun proposed at the Eighth National Congress of the Party that the business dealings between the upper and lower levels and between regions within the state-owned commerce and supply and marketing cooperative system must be a purchasing relationship from bottom to top, rather than a dispatching relationship from top to bottom. This measure is exactly what we urgently need, and it will push commercial work to a new level.

### 商品“划区经营”的制度不合理

    商品“划区经营”的制度不合理
    婺源县位于江西省东北角，紧邻皖、浙，境内多山，交通不便。按照合理的商品流转和运输方向，婺源县的一些日用品应该从东部的浙江省输入。但是，近年来国营商业和供销合作社实行商品“归口”经营，和“划区购销”，一般商品都从婺源西部运来，恰好是逆流而入，造成迂回运输，商品流转费用增加，售价也因此提高。以食盐为例，过去都是由衢县输入，每担浙盐运至婺源批发价为十三元六角六分八厘；现在婺源必须由本省的乐平县拨货，乐平调来的是淮盐，又黑又粗，每担批发价为十四元二角九分四厘，较前者贵六角二分六厘。双钱牌胶鞋，衢县批发价每双三元五角一分，运至婺源的批发价为三元五角八分；但婺源现在的拨货地点是景德镇市，该地批发价每双三元六角六分，运抵婺源批发价为三元七角一分，二者相差一角三分。若衢县至婺源的公路全线修复，改为汽车运输后，食盐的批发价每担将降为十三元零八分，胶鞋每双将降为三元五角六分。
    为了巩固这种拨货制度，商业部门还规定零售单位如到非垂直系统的批发站进货，就不能享受本系统内部调拨优待（降价5％）。
    国营商业和供销社对农、副、土、特产品的采购工作，也同样是按行政区划来进行的，因而各地的收购价格不一致，且不合理。特别是偏僻边远的地区，收购价格越低，农民吃亏很大。从一般情况来看，婺源县收购商品的价格都较邻区低的多，有的竟低到不够生产和运输成本的程度。如供销社在婺源县收购松脂是以南昌的收购价为标准，层层扣减费用和利润而推算出来的，每百斤的收价比安徽休宁县的五城镇平均低38％。又如青石乡的表芯纸一向销往杭州，如按自然流转方向，由产地直运杭州，每担（约四十斤）纸只需运费一元七角二分七厘；现在商业部门规定这种纸由省经营，必须由产地倒运至县城，再倒运到鹰潭，然后再运往杭州，每担运费增到三元三角五分三。如果能够改变这种不合理的流转方向，以今年本县计划收购表芯纸的总数计，即可节省运费二万多元。
    这种不合理的制度必须改变。陈云同志在党的第八次全国代表大会上提出：国营商业、供销社系统内部的上下之间，地区之间的业务往来，必须是自下而上的选购关系，而不是从上而下的派货关系。这一措施正是我们所迫切要求的，它将把商业工作推向新的水平。
