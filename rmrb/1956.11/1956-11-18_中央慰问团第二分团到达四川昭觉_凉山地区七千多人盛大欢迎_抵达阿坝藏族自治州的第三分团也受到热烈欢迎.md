Such a grand welcome is unprecedented in the history of the Liangshan area.

According to Xinhua News Agency, the Central Delegation's Third Sub-delegation arrived at the seat of the Aba Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture People's Committee of Sichuan Province—Shuajingsi—on the afternoon of the 15th, passing through a welcoming line that stretched for three li.

As the delegation passed through the crowd of over 5,000 welcomers from Tibetan, Qiang, Hui, and other ethnic groups, people set off firecrackers, scattered paper flowers, and cheered in unison, "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live the Chinese Communist Party!"

Lamas from Kangcuo Temple, who had traveled from 26 li away, held religious paraphernalia that are only used during the most solemn celebrations and blew on Mangtong, more than one zhang long, to express their welcome.

That day, Shuajingsi was particularly lively, with welcoming arches erected everywhere on the streets and in the alleys, and welcoming slogans in both Tibetan and Chinese posted. Many articles and poems welcoming the delegation appeared on the blackboard newspapers.

Before arriving in Shuajingsi, the Central Delegation's Third Sub-delegation had conducted five days of visits in Wenchuan and Li County in the Aba Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of Sichuan Province. These two counties are areas where Tibetan, Qiang, Han, Hui, and other ethnic groups live in mixed communities. Of the 50,000 Qiang people in the autonomous prefecture, 15,000 are distributed in these two counties. Most of the Qiang people live high in the mountains, building stone houses and cultivating land on slopes. People from all walks of life in Wenchuan and Li County reported to the delegation on the achievements made in various aspects of work in recent years.

    新华社昭觉17日电　中央慰问团副团长王一夫、果基木古、瓦渣木基、阿候鲁木子率领第二分团全体人员，16日在七千多欢迎者欢迎下到达凉山彝族自治州的昭觉。
    这样盛大的欢迎，在凉山地区历史上还是第一次。
    凉山彝族自治州副州长王海明（彝）、刘清顺（汉）、吉狄阿约（彝）、岭邦正（彝），中共凉山地委书记王维训，政协凉山彝族自治州委员会副主席吉纽呷呷，凉山军分区司令员唐兴盛和自治州党、政、军和各人民团体、州一级机关、县一级机关负责人都到郊外欢迎。
    据新华社讯　中央慰问团第三分团15日下午，通过三里长的欢迎行列，到达了四川省阿坝藏族自治州人民委员会所在地——刷经寺。
    当慰问团从五千多藏、羌、回等族欢迎者中间走过时，欢迎的人们燃放鞭炮，投散纸花，一齐欢呼：“毛主席万岁！”“中国共产党万岁！”
    从二十六里外赶来的康错寺喇嘛们，举着只有在庆祝最隆重的节日时才用的宗教仪仗，吹着一丈多长的蟒筒表示欢迎。
    这一天，刷经寺特别热闹，街头巷尾到处都扎起了欢迎牌楼，贴起了藏、汉两种文字的欢迎标语，黑板报上出现了许多欢迎慰问团的文章和诗歌。
    中央慰问团第三分团到达刷经寺之前，曾在四川省阿坝藏族自治州的汶川和理县，先后进行了五天的慰问。这两个县是藏、羌、汉、回等族杂居的地区。自治州的五万羌族中，有一万五千人分布在这两个县。羌族大多数住在高山上面，垒石为室，垦坡为地。汶川和理县的各族各界人民，曾向慰问团汇报了几年来各方面工作的成就。
