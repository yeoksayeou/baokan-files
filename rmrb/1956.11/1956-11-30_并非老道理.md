    "Following the mass line" has become an old saying that everyone can utter. However, if our leading organs therefore cease to preach the principles of the mass line to lower-level cadres, then problems will arise in the implementation of the mass line. In November, at a meeting convened by the Hai澄 [Cheng] County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Fujian to discuss how to implement the mass line in current work, it became apparent that some cadres who deal directly with the masses every day still have many misunderstandings about the mass line. Gan Dedao, deputy secretary of the Zhupu Township branch, said: During the expansion of winter planting last year, they were afraid that too many people would cause conflicting opinions, so they did not consult with the commune members and forcibly assigned tasks with deadlines, which resulted in many losses in production. Some grassroots cadres also believe that if we want to follow the mass line, it is best not to assign tasks. For example, in winter planting, let the masses plant as much as they want. This shows that it is indeed very necessary for the Hai澄 County Committee to hold this meeting to educate everyone. Otherwise, problems will arise again in the implementation of the mass line in this year's winter work. Don't think that the mass line is an old and well-known principle within our Party. It should be recognized that the new elements among our cadres are constantly increasing, and what has become an old principle for others is still a new principle for them. Even for those who have received education on the mass line and generally understand its significance, it does not mean that they no longer need to be educated. When a person develops complacency and arrogance, he will look down on the masses and forget the mass line; when a person is eroded by various non-working-class ideas, he will also be unwilling to follow the mass line... Implementing the mass line, like implementing other principles of the Party, often encounters resistance that requires struggle. Therefore, the practice of the Hai澄 County Committee in educating cadres on the mass line in conjunction with current work is commendable.

    并非老道理
    “走群众路线”已经是一句谁都能讲的老话。可是，如果我们的领导机关因此就不再对下级干部讲群众路线的道理，那么，群众路线的贯彻就要发生问题。11月中，在中共福建海澄县委召开的讨论当前工作中如何贯彻群众路线问题的会议上，就可以看出有些天天直接和群众打交道的干部，对于群众路线还有不少误解。珠浦乡支部副书记甘得道说：去年扩大冬种时，他们怕人多了意见乱纷纷，因此就不和社员商量，硬性分配任务，限期完成，结果给生产造成许多损失。还有些基层干部认为：既要走群众路线，最好就不要分配任务，比如冬种，群众愿意种多少就让他种多少。由此可见，海澄县委召开这次会议对大家进行教育的确是很有必要的。不然，在今年的冬季工作中，群众路线的贯彻就又要发生问题。不要以为群众路线在我们党内已经是人所共知的老道理，应该看到，我们干部中的新成份不断增加，对于别人已经成为老道理的，对他们还是新道理。就是对于已经受过群众路线教育，大体懂得群众路线意义的人，也并不是就不再需要受教育了。当一个人滋长了骄傲自满情绪时，他就会看不起群众，就会忘掉了群众路线；当一个人受到各种非工人阶级思想的侵蚀时，他也会不愿走群众路线……贯彻群众路线和贯彻党的其他各种原则一样，经常会遇到阻力需要进行斗争的。因此，像海澄县委这种结合当前工作对干部进行群众路线教育的作法，就是值得提倡的。
