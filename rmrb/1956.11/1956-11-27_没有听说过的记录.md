    Records Never Heard Of
    Shi Qiang
    Li Qingzhen stormed out of the meeting, his head buzzing with anger. This experience appraisal meeting was infuriating. What District Chief Wang said was unfounded, accusing him of violating operating procedures, prioritizing output over safety and taking reckless risks, and causing the mined ore to be too large to transport... It simply wasn't true. He even said, "This isn't experience; it's nonsense!" You are the one talking nonsense without investigation and research! The more Li Qingzhen thought about it, the angrier he became, and he stomped into a small pub…

    Li Qingzhen was forty years old this year, and he was demobilized in 1950 to work at the Nanfen open-pit iron mine of Benxi Iron and Steel Company. Coming to the mine was like returning home for him. He had worked here for a full eleven years, and in 1945, he joined the army right here. Five years of combat life made him a brave machine gunner. When he responded to the country’s call to demobilize and return to production, and he picked up the rock drill again, he became an excellent miner. Although he was an older man, and he had been wounded in the buttock in the battle to liberate Siping Street in March 1948, the young men couldn't keep up with this old miner. He overfulfilled his tasks every month, and the mobile red flag seemed to have taken root on his rock drill, and no one could pull it away.

    In early 1955, the "Benmai" working face in the third mining area was to resume production. This working face was a "treasure" of the mine, producing ore with a very high iron content. But the working conditions were much worse than in the open-pit mine. It was deep underground, never seeing the sun, and going up and down twice a day was tiring enough. Underground work also required strict techniques. However, Li Qingzhen repeatedly requested to work at the Benmai working face, and his request was finally approved.

    But things didn't go smoothly from the start, and production failed to meet the quota. According to state regulations, each rock drill should extract 30 tons of iron ore per shift (eight hours), but they averaged only 22.5 tons per shift. Li Qingzhen felt very uncomfortable. This was unacceptable. Did they want the blast furnace to wait with its mouth open? To build socialism, what could be built without steel?

    Just as a machine gunner must find ways to eliminate the enemy during wartime, now one must find the cause and break through the quota. With more than ten years of mining experience, Li Qingzhen carefully pondered for more than half a month, and he felt that there was a problem with the labor organization: three shifts of people worked in the same working face day and night, and the output of the three shifts was mixed together, making the responsibility unclear, and not knowing who was good and who was bad; secondly, the rock drillers had different levels of drilling skills, and the selected drilling points were also different. The next shift didn't know where the previous shift had drilled, and each shift had to spend a lot of time repairing "rock debris," because if the hole was drilled on the rock debris, not much ore would collapse, so the three shifts affected each other, and the output was not high.

    The more Li Qingzhen thought about it, the more confident he became, and he discussed it with the people in the shift. They also said it made sense, so they decided to make a bold suggestion to the shift leader, Sheng Yangchun, and the district chief of the third mining area, Wang Yuqing: give him that one shift for one working face. This would not only clarify responsibility but also save time and improve efficiency, because they knew what kind of rock debris would collapse after blasting the holes they drilled themselves, and they could prepare conditions for drilling tomorrow's holes today. Although the number of shifts would be reduced from three to one, and the working hours would be reduced from day and night to eight hours, it was still possible to complete the daily mining quota of 90 tons. But shift leader Sheng Yangchun said, "Nonsense! Who will be responsible if it's not completed?" And District Chief Wang interrupted Li Qingzhen before he finished speaking, saying, "Do you have six hands? If three shifts can't complete it, can one shift complete it? ... No way!"

    Li Qingzhen was very angry. This was having strength but not being allowed to use it, wanting to contribute but not being allowed to. Fine, working the old way was easier… But then he thought, that's not right. If he didn't use his strength now, he would be letting the Party down. Right, if you don't support me, I'll go to the Party!

    At around seven o'clock in the morning, Li Qingzhen arrived at the general Party branch office. After listening to Li Qingzhen's suggestion, Guo Shutan, the general Party branch secretary, happily said, "That's great. Please have someone write a specific plan, and the general branch will discuss it." That day, Li Qingzhen felt particularly happy, and he felt that working was easier than usual. In the evening, technician Liang helped him draw up a specific plan.

    The general branch studied Li Qingzhen's plan and decided to support him, suggesting that the administration give him one working face for experimentation.

    April 1955 was the first month of Li Qingzhen's experiment. At the end of the month, when the calculations were done, ha, the average output per shift reached 87 tons, close to completing the quota for three shifts. The whole shift was happy, but District Chief Wang criticized, "Li Qingzhen only cares about output and doesn't care about safety." Where did that come from? Li Qingzhen felt wronged, but he didn't say much. He thought, whether it's safe or not, let's see what happens later.

    After more than a month of experimentation, not only did the output not decrease, but none of the 21 people in the shift had even scratched their skin. One day, apprentice worker E Wenlin couldn't help but say to Li Qingzhen, "Master Li, we've been experimenting for more than two months, and we've exceeded the quota by two times every month, but not only don't we get an over-quota bonus, but we also don't get the red flag, and we can't even get on the blackboard newspaper, this…."

    Li Qingzhen originally wanted to vent the anger that had been building up for two months, but he swallowed the words back. He said, "Xiao E, who do you say we are experimenting for?" Xiao E was clever and knew he had misspoke, so he said, "Then who did you shed blood for in the war?" Li Qingzhen said, "Yes, we don't seek anything else, we only seek to benefit the country and socialism. Now we produce more ore, and the blast furnace doesn't have to wait with its mouth open, so we should be happy." But even though Li Qingzhen didn't say it, he still had a grudge in his heart, and he used to like to drink a little wine, and now he drank even more.

    It was almost the end of June. That day, after Li Qingzhen finished drilling the last hole, E Wenlin rushed to wipe off the oil stains on the rock drill. The master and apprentice finished the preparations for the next day, one in front and one behind, and began to climb the ladder of the inclined shaft. When they reached halfway, just as they wanted to rest, they suddenly heard someone shouting from above, "Old Li, come up quickly, there's a meeting to appraise your experience!" Finally, the end had come, and the three months of experimentation had not been in vain. Li Qingzhen went to the surface in one breath and rushed to the meeting place without even changing his clothes. When Li Qingzhen arrived and saw District Chief Wang on the podium and the general branch secretary not present, he felt a chill in his heart. Later, District Chief Wang indeed denied his experience.

    The next day, Li Qingzhen went down to the working face still angry. Suddenly, general branch secretary Guo Shutan came. He had returned from a meeting in the city yesterday and heard that Li Qingzhen's experience had been denied. He felt that something was wrong, so he came down to the pit to investigate. He carefully checked Li Qingzhen's operation and found no violations of the operating procedures. It met the safety requirements. In fact, the entire shift had not had a single minor injury accident in three months. As for the collapsed ore, not only were the pieces not large, but they were also small and uniform. The ore miners all said, "The pieces are not large, and it saves a lot of effort."

    Li Qingzhen and the people in the shift finally received rewards, and their experience was also decided to be promoted in the mine. It turned out that District Chief Wang Yuqing was a conservative person who thought that Li Qingzhen's approach had never been heard of before and always thought that the experiment could not succeed. Later, when the experiment succeeded, he did not carefully investigate and research, criticized indiscriminately, and dogmatically denied Li Qingzhen's experience. This time, he himself was strictly criticized.

    On November 4th, we met Li Qingzhen, who came to attend the National Congress of Socialist Construction Activists of Revolutionary Martyrs' Dependents, Military Dependents, Disabled Servicemen, and Demobilized Servicemen, at the Xijiao Hotel. His body was still as strong as a machine gunner, and he was wearing many medals and commemorative medals on his chest. In February of this year, with the support of the Party and the help of technicians, he changed the old operating procedures, created a new set of rock drilling methods, and developed from one shift contracting one working face to contracting two working faces for assembly line operation, which rapidly increased production, from 87 tons per shift to 180 tons per shift… 300 tons… 527 tons… 600 tons. In April of this year, after he participated in the National Conference of Advanced Producers in Heavy Industry and returned to the mine, he gave a performance to the conference representatives who came to visit, one shift mined 750 tons, exceeding the state quota by 24 times. If transported by train, it would require 15 large train cars. Many of the representatives present at the visit were mining experts, but they all said in surprise, "Such a record has never been heard of." Since then, Li Qingzhen's production record has been maintained at an average of around 700 tons per shift, and he has also maintained another glorious record—consistently safe production.

    After the mine promoted Li Qingzhen's experience, the workers generally and repeatedly broke the quota, and the quota was repeatedly revised. The current state quota is 120 tons of iron ore per shift for one rock drill.

    We asked him with a smile, "Do you still drink now?" He also smiled and said, "I quit long ago." But he added, "If I drink, it's at most two liang at a time, and my wife controls it!" In April of this year, a young girl named Liu Hangui married him. He said, "My wife also said to me: 'If I don't do a good job in housework, it's my responsibility, and if you don't complete the production quota, it's your responsibility, let's see who wins over who.' You see, she wants to compete with me."

    没有听说过的记录

    李庆振憋了一肚子气走出会场，脑子里嗡嗡的。这个经验鉴定会开得真窝火。汪区长说的那些话是没有根据的，说什么违反操作规程啦，只顾产量不顾安全净冒险啦，崩下的矿石块大运不出去啦……事实根本不是这样。他还说：“这不叫经验，简直是胡闹！”不调查研究乱嚷嚷，你才是胡闹！李庆振越想越气，怒冲冲地跨进了小酒铺……。
    李庆振今年四十岁了，是1950年复员到本溪钢铁公司南芬露天铁矿工作的。他来到矿上就像回到了老家，在这个矿上，他曾经干了整整十一年的活，1945年，也就在这儿参的军。五年的战斗生活，使他成了一名勇敢的机枪射手。当他响应祖国复员生产的号召，放下机枪重新拿起凿岩机的时候，他又成了一名出色的矿工。虽然他是上了年纪的人了，1948年3月在解放四平街的战斗中，屁股上又负过伤，但是小伙子们却赶不上这个老矿工，他是月月超额完成任务，流动红旗算是在他的凿岩机上长了根，谁也没有能够把它拔走。
    1955年初，第三采区的“本脉”掌子要恢复生产了，这个掌子是矿上的一块“宝”，开采出来的矿石含铁量很多。但干活条件比露天矿场差得多了，它在很深的地下，成天见不到太阳，一天上下两次，够累人的。在井下作业，技术要求也严格。李庆振却一再要求到本脉掌子去工作，他的要求最后被批准了。
    可是一开始就不如意，生产完不成定额。按照国家规定，一台凿岩机每班（八小时）应采铁矿石三十吨，但他们平均每班只采了二十二吨半。李庆振心里很难受。这不像话，难道叫高炉张着嘴等着么？要建设社会主义，没有钢铁建设个啥呢？
    打仗的时候机枪射手要想尽办法消灭敌人，现在就一定得找出原因突破定额。凭着十多年的采矿经验，李庆振细细地琢磨了半个多月，他觉得劳动组织有问题：一昼夜有三班人在一个掌子里倒班作业，三个班的产量混在一起，责任不清，不知道谁好谁坏；其次，凿岩机手打炮眼的技术有高有低，选择的打眼点也不一样，下一班不知道上一班在哪儿打的眼，每班都要花很长时间修理“炮碴”，因为眼打在炮碴上就崩不下很多矿石来，这样三个班互相影响，产量就不高。
    李庆振越想越有把握，他又和班里的人商量，他们也说有理，就打定主意，先后向班长盛扬春和第三采区的区长汪玉清提了一个大胆的建议：一个掌子包给他那一班。这样不但责任明确，而且能节省时间提高效率，因为自己打的眼自己明白，知道放炮后会崩出啥样的炮碴来，今天打眼时就能给明天打眼准备好条件。虽然由三班人减为一班人，由昼夜工作减为八小时工作，仍有可能完成一天采矿九十吨的定额。但班长盛扬春说：“扯蛋！要完不成谁负责？”而汪区长还没等李庆振说完，就给顶了回去：“难道你长六只手？三个班都完成不了，你一班就能完成了？……不行！”
    李庆振很生气，这是有力气不叫使，想出力不叫干。好，照老样子干还轻快些……但他又想，这不对，现在有力气再不使出来，就对不起党了。对，你们不支持，我去找党去！
    早上七点来钟，李庆振就到了党总支办公室。总支书记郭树潭听完了李庆振的建议，高兴地说：“这可好，你请人写个具体计划来，总支讨论一下。”这天李庆振感到特别高兴，干活也觉着比平日轻快。晚上，梁技术员帮助他订出了具体计划。
    总支研究了李庆振的计划，决定支持他，建议行政包给他一个掌子进行试验。
    1955年4月，是李庆振试验的第一个月。月底一计算，哈，平均每班产量达到八十七吨，接近完成三个班的定额。全班人正高兴，但汪区长却批评说：“李庆振只顾产量，不顾安全。”这从那儿说起？李庆振觉着委曲，但他没有多说，他想，到底安全不安全，再往后看吧。
    又试验了一个多月，不但产量没有降低，全班二十一个人仍没有一个人碰破过一点皮。一天，徒工鄂文林忍不住了，对李庆振说：“李师傅，咱们试验两个多月啦，哪月不超额两倍，可是不但不给超额奖，也拿不到红旗，连黑板报也上不去，这……。”
    李庆振本来也想泄一泄憋了两个月的气，但话到嘴边又咽下去了。他说：“小鄂，你说咱们试验为的是谁？”小鄂很机灵，知道自己说走了嘴，就说：“那你打仗流血为的是谁？”李庆振说：“是啊，咱们不图别的，只求对国家对社会主义有好处，现在咱们多出矿石，高炉不用张嘴等了，咱们就该高兴。”不过李庆振嘴里不说心里总还是憋着一股气，他本来爱喝点酒，现在喝得更多了。
    快到6月底了。这天，李庆振打完最后一个炮眼，鄂文林抢着擦去凿岩机上的油污，师徒两个，把第二天的准备工作做完，一前一后开始爬升坑的梯子。爬到半腰，正想歇歇，忽听见上面有人喊：“老李头，快上来，开会鉴定你的经验啦！”这下总算熬到头了，试验三个来月没有白费。李庆振一口气就上了地面，连衣服也不换就赶到会场。李庆振到场一看，汪区长在主席台上，总支书记没有在场，心里就凉了半截。后来，汪区长果然否定了他的经验。
    第二天，李庆振下到掌子上还光生气，忽然总支书记郭树潭来了。他昨天从市里开会回来，听说否定了李庆振的经验，觉着不对头，就下坑来调查。他仔细地检查李庆振操作情况，没有发现违反操作规程的现象，是符合安全要求的，事实上，三个月来全班也没有发生过一次微伤事故。至于崩下来的矿石，不但块不大，而且又小又匀。出矿工人都说：“块不大，很省劲。”
    李庆振和班上的人终于都得到了奖励，他们的经验也决定在矿上推广。原来区长汪玉清是个思想保守的人，认为李庆振这样做法过去从来没听说过，总以为试验不能成功。后来试验成功了，又不仔细调查研究，乱批评，武断地否定了李庆振的经验，这回他自己受到了严格批评。
    11月4日，我们在西郊宾馆会见了前来出席全国烈属、军属、残废军人、复员军人社会主义建设积极分子大会的李庆振。他的身板仍像机枪射手那样壮实，胸前挂着好些奖章和纪念章。今年2月，他在党的支持和技术人员的帮助下，改变了旧的操作规程，创造了一套新的凿岩方法，并且由一班包一个掌子发展到包两个掌子，进行流水作业，使产量急速提高，从每班八十七吨，增加到每班一百八十吨……三百吨……五百二十七吨……六百吨。今年4月，他参加了全国重工业先进生产者代表会议后回到矿上，给前来参观的会议代表们作了一次表演，一班采了七百五十吨，超过国家定额二十四倍。如果用火车装运，需要十五节大型车皮。在场参观的代表们中有不少就是采矿能手，但他们都惊喜地说：“这样的记录没有听说过。”从那以后，李庆振的生产记录一直保持在平均每班七百吨上下，而且他也保持了另一个光荣的记录——始终安全生产。
    矿上推广了李庆振的经验以后，工人们普遍地一再突破定额，定额也就一再改动，现在的国家定额已是一台凿岩机每班采铁矿石一百二十吨了。
    我们笑着问他：“你现在还喝酒吗？”他也笑了，说：“早戒啦。”但又补充：“要是喝，一顿最多二两，有我媳妇掌握着呢！”今年4月，一个年轻的姑娘刘汉桂和他结了婚。他说：“我媳妇还对我说：‘搞不好家务是我的责任，完不成生产定额是你的责任，看谁胜过谁。’你们看，她要和我竞赛呢。”
