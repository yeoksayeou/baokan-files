    To Examine Past Mistakes, a Comprehensive Analysis Is Needed
    Bai Zhiming, Secretary of the Yan'an Local Committee of the Chinese Communist Party
    Currently, Party organizations at all levels in the Yan'an area are studying the documents of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China. In the course of this study, many comrades have been able to relate their work to the examination and propose ways to improve it, which is good. But can we conclude from this that the state of learning is already satisfactory? No. Not only is our learning not yet widespread and in-depth enough, but some comrades have also developed certain one-sided views and arguments.
    Subjectivism and bureaucratism, especially since this year, have not only been seriously present but are also growing. Many comrades have recognized this, which is good. However, in conducting examinations and criticisms, some comrades, due to a lack of a comprehensive analytical perspective, have adopted an attitude of negating everything, as if everything in the past was wrong. For example, everyone has pointed out that the agricultural production increase targets set by the counties this year were too high and impossible to achieve. Some comrades, fearing being labeled as conservative, added more targets layer by layer from top to bottom, resulting in commandism. It should be admitted that this is a fact, and the leading organs of the area cannot shirk this responsibility. This is because we overestimated the favorable conditions brought about by cooperativization, and when utilizing these conditions, we did not differentiate and treated everything the same, resulting in an eagerness for quick results when determining agricultural production increase measures for the agricultural cooperatives. However, if we conduct examinations in the way some comrades are doing now, simply picking out a few prominent examples and making a general criticism without conducting a concrete analysis of the actual situation, this approach will not allow everyone to recognize what was done correctly and what was done incorrectly in the past. For example, we planned for several thousand-jin mu this spring, and it has now been proven that some are close to completion, some have not been completed, and some are far from completion; some have not only been completed but have exceeded expectations by a large margin. According to incomplete statistics, the yields of crops such as corn, rice, and millet in nine counties including Yan'an, Fu County, Yanchang, Yijun, Huanglong, Luochuan, Ganquan, Huangling, and Yichuan, have reached over a thousand jin per mu in 184 mu, with the highest reaching 1,500 jin. May I ask: Can these facts be denied? Shouldn't we warmly welcome and learn from those agricultural cooperatives and their members who have worked hard to increase production? Isn't this a good education for those who once doubted that "thousand-jin mu could appear in the Yan'an area"? Therefore, we cannot simply explain the problem of those who did not complete the task with a simple "excessive demands." Similarly, we must also analyze the specific situation. If it is indeed proven that the conditions were not in place and it was only based on subjective wishes, and the superiors insisted on completing it, then this is a "leftist" rash advance that is divorced from reality and the masses; if the facts prove that the task was not completed because they adopted a passive attitude and did not actively try to find ways to overcome difficulties, then it is not a problem of rash advance.
    It is undeniable that at present, we should first and foremost focus on overcoming the "leftist" rash emotions in the leadership's thinking, which is the main thing, but we cannot condone those who still have conservative ideas, allowing them to gloat and say: Look at you who are so enthusiastic, now you get to taste the bitterness. In fact, the losses brought to the work by those who are sluggish, without any vitality, and unwilling to look forward are no less than those with rash emotions. Even today, those with conservative ideas are completely discriminating against and excluding many new people and new things; the facts of advanced figures are clearly in front of them, but they stubbornly refuse to admit them, instead saying: This person has many shortcomings and does not perform well, this person is bragging. These comrades see the shortcomings of others as so "sharp" and "obvious," but they do not mention a word about their own conservative ideas. Therefore, when we criticize blind advances, we must not commit the mistake of conservatism. If even the correct things are rejected along with the incorrect, then this is a major deviation.
    From this, it seems that in our actual work, we must overcome two kinds of subjectivism: one is not considering objective conditions, being divorced from reality and the masses, committing the subjectivism of blind advance; the other is being complacent and lagging behind the masses, failing to keep up with the needs, and having the subjectivism of conservative ideas. We must learn a lesson: in the past, when criticizing conservative ideas, we treated all those who raised opposing views but had legitimate reasons as conservative and criticized them, and today, without analysis, we treat everything as rash advances and criticize them, all of which are wrong.
    When examining subjectivism and bureaucratism, in order to explain the problem, we should naturally cite some typical examples. However, citing typical examples is not only to illustrate the seriousness of the problem, but also to find the causes of errors through comparison and analysis of the examples. Only in this way can we truly learn from the lessons and avoid using subjectivism to oppose subjectivism, and only in this way can we resolutely implement the scientific working method of investigation and research in future work, consult with the masses and lower levels in our work. If we learn this method, we can truly improve ourselves a step further, and future mistakes can be avoided or made less often.
    In today's situation, there are still many comrades who are distancing themselves from the Party's call to overcome subjectivism and bureaucratism. There are several reasons for this. The first is because the examination of subjectivism and bureaucratism is mainly focused on cooperativization and agricultural production, which is necessary. However, some comrades who do not work in agricultural cooperativization and agricultural production have therefore adopted an indifferent and passive attitude towards the examination of subjectivism and bureaucratism, which is wrong. People who have this view are separating the part of the work they do from the Party's overall work and not treating it as a whole. At the same time, in addition to the main aspects, there are also secondary aspects. The second is that they believe that self-criticism from the bottom up and exposing errors may "ruin things" once the "leaders" have not expressed their attitude and the opinions are not yet mature. Therefore, they still dare not take action and are waiting and watching, and even within a county, there is no movement up and down. Using this attitude to overcome subjectivism and bureaucratic errors can only be empty talk. Therefore, we have reason to demand that a review should be carried out in all places where learning is not good today, with the leadership taking responsibility, personally taking action, enlightening the masses, and conscientiously and actively reviewing their work.
    Now, there is a phenomenon of mutual blaming and shifting responsibility in some places, fearing that superiors will criticize and punish them. Our analysis is that this is because in the past, when criticizing a certain error or shortcoming, some comrades always simply emphasized "investigating responsibility" and "writing a self-criticism," which often led to results that were contrary to expectations. For example, when it comes to digging wells, two-thirds of the results of our planned completion this year are good and useful, and one-third has become abandoned wells. The lesson we have learned in this area is that due to the lack of good investigation and research, summarizing the experience of the masses, coupled with the short time and heavy tasks, and the lack of timely technical guidance, some unnecessary losses have been caused, which is a lack of the viewpoint of the mass line. However, whether there are other reasons in the specific implementation should also be studied. Before clarifying the problem, we should not first investigate who is responsible for the greater and who is responsible for the smaller. Of course, this does not mean that we do not distinguish the responsibility for errors. We are only saying that if we simply investigate responsibility, we cannot achieve the goal. The reasons for causing one-third of abandoned wells will not be completely the same. We must conduct a concrete analysis and use reasoning to improve their ideological understanding from a positive perspective. As long as everyone's awareness is raised, comrades who have made mistakes will willingly and consciously conduct self-criticism. By using this method to improve thinking, clarify problems, learn lessons, and study improvement methods, we can achieve the goal of completely solving the problem. We must educate everyone that as long as we proceed from reality and adhere to the truth, we will increase unlimited strength, and we must cultivate the ability of each comrade to independently think about problems and solve problems through practice, and we will increase the courage to move forward.
    I feel that if we pay attention to these problems and explain them to some unclear and worried comrades, we can overcome subjectivism and bureaucratism and take a step forward in ideological understanding through studying the "Eighth National Congress" documents, and do our work well.

    检查过去的错误，要进行全面分析
    中共延安地方委员会书记　白志明
    目前，延安专区各级党组织，正在学习中国共产党第八次代表大会的文件。在学习中，许多同志都能够联系检查自己的工作，并提出改进的办法，这是好的。但是我们能不能就此得出结论说学习的状况已经可以令人满意了呢？不能。不但我们的学习还不够普遍深入，而且在某些同志中间，产生了某些带有片面性的看法和说法。
    主观主义和官僚主义，特别是今年以来，不但严重存在，而且是在滋长着。很多同志已经认识到这一点，这是好的。但是在进行检查和批判时，有些同志由于缺乏全面分析的观点，采取了否定一切的态度，好像过去的一切都是不对的。例如，大家都指出的今年各县农业增产指标提的过高，本来就完不成任务，有些同志又怕戴保守思想的帽子，自上而下层层追加，结果产生了强迫命令。应当承认这是事实，专区的领导机关首先不能开脱这个责任。这是由于我们对于合作化带来的有利条件作了过高的估计，在利用这些条件时，又不加区别一概而论，在确定农业社的增产措施时，就产生了急躁情绪。但是如果我们在进行检查时，像现在有些同志那样，只是顺便找来几个突出的例子，笼统地批判一番，对于实际情况不进行具体分析，这种作法是不能使大家认识到过去那些是作对了的，那些是作错了的。比方我们今春曾计划了若干千斤亩，现在证明有的接近完成，有的没有完成，甚至差的很远；有的不但完成了，而且超过很多。据不完全统计，延安、鄜县、延长、宜君、黄龙、洛川、甘泉、黄陵、宜川等九县的玉米、水稻、谷子等作物，有一百八十四亩的产量均在千斤以上，最高的达到一千五百斤。试问：对于这样的事实能否认吗？对于这样努力增加生产的农业社和社员们，不应该表示热忱的欢迎并向他们学习吗？这对于那些曾经怀疑“延安专区还能有千斤亩出现”的人不是一个很好的教育吗？因此对于那些没有完成任务的，不能只用简单的“要求过高”一句话来解释问题。同样，也要分析一下具体情况，如果确实证明条件不具备，只是单凭主观愿望，而上级又一股脑强调完成，这就是脱离实际，脱离群众的“左”的冒进情绪；如果事实证明，任务所以没有完成是因为自己采取了消极态度，没有主动的想办法来努力克服困难，那就不是急躁冒进的问题了。
    不可否认，在当前我们首先应当抓住克服领导思想上“左”的急躁情绪，这是主要的，但是我们不能纵容那些至今仍然存在着保守思想的人，让他们得意忘形地说：看你们这些积极性很高的，这一下挨到你们尝尝苦头了。其实，那些疲疲沓沓、没有一点生气和不愿意往前看的人，给工作所带来的损失，也并不亚于有急躁情绪的人。一直到今天，那些有保守思想的人，对于许多新人新事完全采取了歧视和排斥的态度；先进人物的事实明明摆在他们的面前，但他们硬不愿承认，反而说：这个人缺点很多，表现不好，这个人瞎吹牛。这些同志看人家的缺点是这样的“尖锐”，“明显”，但对自己的保守思想却一字不提。因此，我们批判盲目冒进的时候，决不能又犯了保守主义。如果连正确的东西也给一起反掉了，这就是很大的偏差。
    由此看来，我们在实际工作中，要克服两种主观主义：一种是不顾客观条件，脱离实际，脱离群众，犯了盲目冒进的主观主义；另一种是故步自封，落在群众后面，赶不上需要，有保守思想的主观主义。我们必须吸取教训：过去在批判保守思想时，曾经把一些提出反面意见但有正当理由的人统统当作保守思想批判了一顿，而今天又不作分析把一切都当作急躁冒进来批判，这都是错误的。
    在检查主观主义、官僚主义时，为了说明问题，自然应当举出一些典型事例。但是举出典型事例，并不仅仅是为了说明问题的严重性，而且要通过事例的对比、分析，寻找出产生错误的原因。只有这样，才能真正的吸取教训，才不会用主观主义反对主观主义，才会在今后的工作中，坚决地执行调查研究这一科学的工作方法，在工作中和群众商量，和下级商量。我们学到了这个方法，就可以真正的把自己提高一步，今后的错误就可能避免或少犯了。
    在今天的情况下，还有许多同志在党号召大家克服主观主义和官僚主义的时候，却把自己置身于事外。这里有几种情况，第一种是因为把检查主观主义和官僚主义主要放在合作化和农业生产方面，这是必要的。但是有些不做农业合作化和农业生产工作的同志，却因此对于检查主观主义、官僚主义采取了漠不关心的消极态度，这就不对了。产生这种观点的人，是因为把自己所作的一部分工作和党的整个工作割裂开来，没有把它当作一个整体来看待。同时，除了主要方面，也还有次要方面。第二种是认为自下而上的检查工作、揭发错误，在“领导者”还没有表示态度，意见还不成熟的时候，一下检查就可能把“事情闹烂包”，因此，至今还不敢动手，在那里等待观望，甚至在一县之内上上下下还没有一点动静。用这种态度来克服主观主义和官僚主义错误，只能是一种空谈，因此我们有理由要求，凡是今天学习得不好的地方，都应当进行一次检查，领导负责，亲自动手，启发群众，认真的主动的检查自己的工作。
    现在有些地方已经出现了互相埋怨、互相推卸责任的现象，生怕上级给他们批评处分。我们分析，这是因为以往有些同志，在批评某一错误缺点时，总是单纯的强调“追查责任”、“写一个检讨”，因此，常常弄得事与愿违。比如打水井，我们今年计划完成的结果，三分之二是好的，有用的，三分之一成了废井。对于这一点，我们专区取得的教训是：由于没有很好的调查研究，总结群众的经验，加上时间短，任务大，技术指导不及时等等原因，造成了某些不应有的损失，这就是缺乏群众路线的观点。但在具体执行时，是不是还有其他原因，也是应当研究的。在弄清问题之前，首先不要追究谁的责任大，谁的责任小。这当然不是说，不分清错误的责任。我们只是说，如果简单的追查责任，就不能达到目的。造成三分之一废井的原因不会是完全一样的，我们要进行具体分析，并用说理的方法，从正面来提高其思想认识。只要大家的觉悟提高了，有错误的同志就会心悦诚服地自觉地进行自我批评。用这种方法提高思想、弄清问题、取得教训、研究改进办法，就可以达到彻底解决问题的目的。要教育大家，只要我们从实际出发，坚持真理，我们就会增加无限的力量，要通过实际培养每个同志独立思考问题、解决问题的能力，我们就会增加前进的勇气。
    我觉得，我们对这些问题注意到了，并且给一些不清醒和有顾虑的同志加以解释，我们就能通过学习“八大”文件，克服主观主义和官僚主义，在思想认识上提高一步，做好工作。
