Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, November 26th (Xinhua News Agency Reporter Xu Zhongni): Unhealthy tendencies among some employees in Shanghai regarding the relationship between individual interests and national interests, as well as phenomena of lax discipline and moral degradation, have drawn widespread attention from Party organizations at all levels in the industrial sector. Recently, various industrial enterprises have been strengthening political and ideological work and are preparing to conduct broad socialist ideological education for employees.

Most industrial enterprises' Party organizations have first investigated and analyzed these unhealthy tendencies. Party and administrative leaders are now keenly aware that a significant reason for the growth of these tendencies is that Party organizations' leadership in production work was relatively lax in political and ideological leadership in the previous period. The agenda of some enterprises' Party committees included specialized discussions on political and ideological work for almost the first time this year. A workshop branch secretary from the Shanghai Machine Tool Plant reflected on the previous period, saying: "When reporting work to the Party committee, all you needed was a notebook recording the completion of production targets."

Investigations and analyses have revealed another important reason: In leading the advanced producer movement this year, emphasis was placed on material rewards, but the work of promoting advanced thought was insufficient. The evaluation criteria for advanced producers generally focused only on the completion of work quotas, while there were still loopholes in the formulation and management of quotas, some of which were unrealistic or too lenient, encouraging some employees to engage in fraudulent behavior. The number of rationalization proposals in some factories is gradually decreasing, while the overall figures for excess working hours and wages in the factory are constantly increasing. The reporter interviewed a worker whose wage income exceeded his basic wage by more than double, but he had not made much improvement in production technology recently. These situations blurred the socialist principle of "to each according to his work" among employees.

This year, various enterprises have generally paid attention to the work of caring for employees' welfare, but insufficient attention has been paid to employees' political and ideological situations. This is another reason found by most enterprises in this investigation and analysis. Some cadres mistakenly believe that doing a good job of caring for people means giving more money. Some factories blindly made plans for welfare measures that were temporarily impossible to implement, and then failed to explain and educate employees after the plans fell through. On the other hand, some welfare benefits that could be provided now were not seriously implemented, causing employee dissatisfaction.

Another noteworthy reason is that some enterprise leaders themselves have incorrect ideas about wage level adjustments, and individual leaders have even taken the lead in arguing about levels and making trouble, thus losing sensitivity to the unhealthy tendencies among the masses of employees. Some cadres have also developed ideas of extravagance and waste in recent times, paying attention to pomp and circumstance when arranging award ceremonies or other recreational activities, with those below following suit.

The investigation and analysis revealed that most of the current phenomena of lax discipline and moral degradation occur among the new workers and apprentices who entered the factory in large numbers this year. Many of them are workers who have transferred from non-industrial jobs, unemployed or self-taught youth, and many are from bourgeois families. The Party and the Communist Youth League have focused on quickly training them to improve their skills, but little work has been done to educate them in light of their characteristics and some old habits. Many upright workers in the enterprise have criticized and advised some of the young workers on their misbehavior. However, this action has not received full support, leading to the rise of unhealthy trends in some workshops, with uprightness not being promoted.

In response to these main reasons found in the investigation and analysis, the Party organizations of Shanghai's industrial enterprises are currently strengthening their work in the following areas:

Among the enterprise leaders, the study of the "Eighth National Congress" documents has already begun, combined with practical experience, to summarize and examine this year's production work and political and ideological work, and to examine subjectivism, bureaucratism, and sectarianism in leadership work. The Shanghai Diesel Engine Plant is summarizing the experience of employee representatives inspecting administrative management work, and letting workers revise quotas themselves; the Shanghai Machine Tool Plant and some other plants are conducting inspections of quota, reward, and other systems and management work, and are studying improvement measures. Some factories that had scheduled too much time for after-work cultural and technical studies in the previous period are considering making appropriate adjustments to ensure time for regular political and ideological education.

Ideological education work, with the promotion of the fine traditions of hard work, simplicity, and diligence in construction as the main content, is being carried out from cadres to the broad masses of employees. The focus of factory and workshop bulletin boards and radio broadcasts has shifted to this aspect, and Party and Youth League classes have also increased. The Youth League's activities, in response to the unhealthy tendencies among young workers and new workers, focus on communist morality and discipline education. Employee representatives from the Shanghai Diesel Engine Plant have organized two inspection teams to check waste and unhealthy tendencies, and have held an anti-theft exhibition. While extensively mobilizing employees to conduct self-education, some factories have imposed disciplinary sanctions on individuals who have seriously violated discipline and moral degradation.

In the new joint state-private enterprises currently preparing for wage reform, a broad education will also be conducted among employees on how to treat joint state-private enterprises with the attitude of masters.

### 上海各企业党组织纠正个人和集体关系方面的不良倾向  对职工加强艰苦朴素勤俭建设的思想教育

    上海各企业党组织纠正个人和集体关系方面的不良倾向
    对职工加强艰苦朴素勤俭建设的思想教育
    新华社上海26日电　新华社记者徐中尼报道：上海部分职工在对待个人利益同国家利益的关系方面出现的不良倾向和纪律松弛、道德败坏的现象，已经引起工业部门中共各级党组织的普遍重视。最近，各个工业企业正在加强政治思想工作，并且准备对职工进行一次广泛的社会主义思想教育。
    大部分工业企业的党组织，首先对这些不良倾向作了调查和分析。党和行政领导人员现在都警觉地认识到，这些不良倾向所以得以滋长的一个重要原因，是前一时期党的组织在领导生产的工作中，政治思想的领导比较放松；有些企业的中共党委会今年的议事日程上几乎是第一次专门讨论政治思想工作。上海机床厂的车间支部书记反映前一时期的情况说：到党委会汇报工作，只要带本记录生产指标完成情况的簿子去就行了。
    在调查分析中又揭露出另一个重要原因：今年在领导先进生产者运动中，注重了物质奖励，但是发扬先进思想的工作做得很不够。先进生产者的评选标准一般只着重工时定额的完成量，而定额的制定和管理方面还有漏洞，有的不切实际，有的太松，助长了一些职工弄虚作假的行为。有的厂合理化建议在逐渐减少，而全厂工时和工资超额的数字却不断增长。记者曾经访问过一个工资收入超过基本工资一倍多的工人，他近来在生产技术上并没有多少改进。这些情况，在职工中模糊了按劳取酬的社会主义原则。
    今年各个企业普遍注意了关心职工生活福利的工作，但是对职工政治思想情况的关心做得不够。这是大部分企业在这次调查和分析中找出的另一个原因。有的干部误以为做好关心人的工作就是多给些钱。有的厂对暂时不可能办到的福利措施，盲目地作出计划，而在计划落空以后，又没有向职工进行解释和教育。在另一方面，有些目前可以办好的福利，却没有认真办好，引起职工的不满。
    值得着重提到的又一个原因是：有些企业的领导干部本身对待工资级别的调整存在着不正确的思想，个别领导干部还曾经带头争级别、闹情绪，因此丧失了对职工群众中不良倾向的敏感。有些干部最近时期还滋长了铺张、浪费思想，安排给奖大会或其他文娱活动的时候讲究排场，上行下效。
    在调查分析中发现，目前纪律松弛、道德败坏的现象，大部分发生在今年大批进厂的新工人和徒工中。他们很多是非产业工人转业人员、社会失业或自学的青年，有不少是资产阶级家庭出身的。党和青年团注意了迅速培养他们提高技能，但是针对他们的特点和一些旧习性进行教育的工作做得很少。许多企业的正直的工人，对于青年工人中的一些不良行为曾经有过指责和劝导。但是这种行动没有得到充分支持，以致有的车间邪气抬头，正气不扬。
    针对这些在调查分析中找到的主要原因，目前上海工业企业的党组织正在从以下几个方面加强自己的工作：
    在企业的领导干部中，已经开始结合“八大”文件的学习，联系实际，总结和检查今年的生产工作和政治思想工作，检查领导工作中的主观主义、官僚主义和宗派主义。上海柴油机厂正在总结职工代表检查行政管理工作，以及放手让工人自己修订定额的工作经验；上海机床厂和其他一些厂，正在进行对定额、奖励等制度和管理工作的检查，并且研究改进的措施。有的在前一时期业余文化技术学习时间排得过多的厂，正在考虑作适当的调剂，保证有时间进行经常性的政治思想教育工作。
    从干部到广大职工，以发扬艰苦朴素、勤俭建设的优良传统为主要内容的思想教育工作，正在展开。工厂和车间的黑板报、广播的宣传中心已经转到这方面来，党课和团课也增加了。青年团的活动，针对青年工人和新工人中的不良倾向，着重进行共产主义道德品质和纪律教育。上海柴油机厂的职工代表组织了两个以检查浪费和不良倾向为对象的检查组，并且举办了反偷窃展览会。在广泛发动职工进行自我教育的同时，有的厂对严重的违反纪律和道德败坏的分子作了纪律处分。
    目前正在准备工资改革的新合营工厂中，也将广泛地向职工进行一次如何以主人翁的态度对待公私合营企业的教育。
