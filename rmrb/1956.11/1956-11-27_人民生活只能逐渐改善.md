An editorial:

    Some seemingly ordinary issues are often significant problems in our social life. For example, the relationship between national construction and people's lives is one such issue.

    What is the correct relationship between national construction and people's lives? In the long run, in our socialist country, the ultimate goal of all construction is to greatly improve the material and cultural living standards of the people. No one doubts this today. Because no one believes that we are building factories and opening mines today for a few people to get rich, as in old China and capitalist countries. However, the current industrial construction, with heavy industry as its center, will inevitably lead to some contradictions with the needs of people's daily lives. That is to say, on the one hand, we must concentrate our efforts to prioritize the development of heavy industry and build a basically complete industrial system, because without these, there is no possibility of our country's prosperity and strength. On the other hand, we must also pay attention to satisfying the various legitimate needs of people's daily lives as much as possible, and correctly determine the proportion of accumulation and consumption in the national income. If these aspects are not handled well, it is easy to cause dissatisfaction among the people. It is precisely for this reason that our Party constantly struggles against the phenomenon of not caring about the people's lives. Our specific policy is to gradually improve the people's living standards on the basis of developing production and increasing labor productivity. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, all our constructions have embodied this policy.

    The following figures can illustrate the great efforts the Party and the government have made over the years to gradually improve the people's lives.

    The sales volume of cotton cloth in 1950 was 56.47 million bolts, and it is expected to reach 177 million bolts this year, an increase of more than two times. The national retail sales of sugar in 1955 increased by 163% compared to 1950. This shows that while developing heavy industry, we have also paid corresponding attention to the development of light industry and agriculture to meet the needs of people's lives. From 1950 to 1955, the state built 50 million square meters of staff and worker dormitories. This figure does not include houses built by various units themselves and houses built by staff and workers using self-construction and public assistance methods. How big is 50 million square meters? It is almost equal to the building area of two and a half Beijing cities before liberation. This unprecedented scale of residential construction shows that the Party and the government are very concerned about the people's housing problems. As for cultural life, the number of theaters and cinemas alone increased by more than 1,300 in 1955 compared to 1950 (not including clubs run by various units and grassroots trade unions). In addition, the wages of staff and workers have increased over the years, with an increase of 13% this year; the income of farmers has also increased compared to before. All of this shows that people's lives have been gradually improved since liberation.

    However, it must be seen that our country is a backward country. Under the long-term oppression and enslavement of the reactionary ruling class and imperialists, our country was once one of the countries with the lowest living standards in the world. It was not an isolated phenomenon that eighteen-year-old girls had no pants to wear before liberation. Almost every year, hundreds of thousands or millions of people starved or froze to death, and hundreds or thousands of people wandered on the streets with no houses to live in at all. After liberation, after seven years of recovery and construction, the face of our country has undergone fundamental changes, and all aspects are advancing by leaps and bounds. The vast majority of people have enough to eat, enough to wear, and have houses to live in. The tragic era is gone forever. These facts that we have witnessed are self-evident. However, this is only one side. We must also see the other side, that is, compared with advanced countries, we are still economically backward, and not just five or ten years behind, but decades behind. For example, our heavy industry has developed greatly in recent years, and steel production has increased from more than 1.3 million tons in 1952 to more than 4 million tons this year. However, this figure is still not as good as Belgium's steel production; if calculated on a per capita basis, it is even more backward. Our textile industry has a relatively good foundation, and it has also developed greatly after liberation, but if calculated on a per capita basis, the output is still not as good as India.

    We are not afraid to tell the truth about our country's still backward situation. We have not been overwhelmed by the victories of the past few years and become arrogant and complacent. We must catch up and surpass them. We are determined to transform our country from a backward agricultural country into an advanced socialist industrial country. Precisely because of this, we need to take a portion of the national income, say 20%, as accumulation, in order to invest in construction (primarily heavy industry) and expanded reproduction. We cannot allow the national income to be inappropriately and excessively used for daily consumption. That is to say, the improvement of people's lives can only adopt a gradual approach. It must be made clear to all the people that it is impossible to completely solve all the difficulties in people's lives in just a few years, nor is it possible to immediately satisfy all kinds of needs of the people.

    Of course, if we do not take care of the people's needs and blindly and isolatedly develop heavy industry, or one-sidedly emphasize accelerating the speed of heavy industry development, we will make the mistake of rash advance, which will alienate us from the masses and harm the current interests of the people. However, conversely, if we only see the current interests and personal interests of the people and invest too much financial and material resources in living consumption, such as raising wages higher and greatly increasing investment in consumer goods production and public utilities, even if everyone is happy for a while, serious consequences will arise before long. Because this will seriously affect the speed of construction, affect the consolidation of the socialist economic foundation, and harm the long-term interests of the people.

    Therefore, the improvement of people's lives must be gradual. Only this policy is in line with the actual situation of our country and in line with the laws of economic development. Violating this policy means violating the long-term and collective interests of the people.

    Since the improvement of life can only be gradual, that is to say, some of the difficulties in people's lives cannot be solved quickly. Then, many phenomena, such as crowded houses, crowded trams, and inconvenience in eating meat and oil, of course cannot be eliminated immediately. Even after a few more years, when our production is more developed, labor productivity is higher than it is now, and the economic foundation is more solid, the improvement of living standards will still only be gradual. Because people's needs for life will be greater and higher at that time. We must understand that the degree of improvement in life can never exceed the degree of increase in production at any time. Only in this way can we ensure that we have the strength to continuously expand reproduction and ensure that the improvement of our lives is built on a very solid foundation.

    It is currently very necessary to explain these principles clearly to the masses. In the previous period, in our propaganda work, especially in some newspapers and periodicals, there was more talk about improving life and less talk about arduous construction. This may cause some misunderstandings among people, thinking that our current economic conditions are already very good and that we don't need to pay attention to diligence and thrift. In addition, there are some things that we talk a lot about but cannot do or cannot completely do, such as the problem of crowded houses in cities. Even if the state can spend more money to build dormitories, it is impossible to solve them quickly and universally due to the limitations of the supply of raw materials such as cement, bricks, and wood. In this way, staff and workers will blame us for making empty promises. Therefore, advocating diligence and thrift, and arduous construction, is still our top priority at present. In this regard, the leaders of our enterprises, institutions, and schools should take the lead and carry forward the spirit of simplicity and sharing weal and woe with the masses. We have completed two great revolutions through hardships and difficulties; we must also gradually build our country from a backward agricultural country into a socialist industrial country with the spirit of diligence, thrift, and overcoming difficulties. Without this spirit, our cause will progress slowly or even suffer setbacks.

    Of course, adopting a gradual approach to improving life does not mean no progress at all, and the fact is not so. Our annual national budgets all take into account the needs of people's lives, and our lives are indeed improving year by year, and future development will continue to be so. However, we should not expect this improvement to be too high or too fast, because it is impossible.

    Our advocacy of diligence and thrift and overcoming difficulties is by no means an excuse for bureaucrats who do not care about the hardships of the masses, allowing things that can be done to go undone and problems that can be solved to go unsolved. On the contrary, problems that are urgently needed in people's lives and can be solved must be solved. For example, some urgently needed and feasible welfare facilities for staff and workers should be built in a planned and step-by-step manner. Certain tense situations in the needs of people's lives caused by poor planning, improper arrangements, and poor systems should be actively taken measures to change.

    In short, putting the relationship between national construction and the improvement of people's lives in the right place, and appropriately combining these two aspects, is not only a major policy issue that the Party and the government should pay attention to, but also an issue that every worker, staff member, and all working people should understand. If everyone has a clear understanding in their minds, they will be able to work diligently and persistently to increase production and practice economy, and build our motherland into a prosperous and strong socialist industrial country, and a greater improvement in our living standards will be effectively guaranteed.

### 人民生活只能逐渐改善

    人民生活只能逐渐改善
    一些看起来很普通的问题，常常是我们社会生活中的重大问题，比方，国家建设和人民生活的关系就是这样一种问题。
    什么是国家建设和人民生活的正确关系呢？从长远来说，在我们社会主义国家里，一切建设的最终目的，是为了大大提高人民的物质和文化生活水平。这一点今天是没有人怀疑了。因为谁也不相信，今天我们盖工厂、开矿山，是为了少数人发财致富，像旧中国和资本主义国家那样。可是眼前以重工业为中心的工业建设，却不可避免地要跟人民日常生活的需要发生某些矛盾。这就是说，我们一方面要集中力量优先发展重工业、建设一个基本上完整的工业体系，因为没有这些就谈不到我们国家的繁荣和富强；而另外一方面，我们还要注意到尽可能地满足人民日常生活的各种正当需要，正确地确定国民收入中积累和消费的比例。在这些方面如果掌握不好，就很容易引起人民群众的不满。正是因为这个原故，我们的党经常和那种不关心人民生活的现象作斗争。我们的具体方针就是在发展生产、提高劳动生产率的基础上，逐步提高人民的生活水平。从中华人民共和国成立以后，我们的各项建设都体现了这个方针。
    下面的一些数字可以说明党和政府历年来为逐步改善人民生活作了多大的努力。
    棉布的销售量在1950年是五千六百四十七万匹，今年预计将达到一万七千七百万匹，即增加了两倍多。食糖1955年的全国零售量比1950年增加了163％。这说明我们在发展重工业的同时，也相应地注意了发展轻工业和农业，以满足人民生活的需要。从1950年到1955年，国家新建了五千万平方公尺的职工宿舍，这个数字还不包括各单位自建和职工用自建公助办法修成的房子。五千万平方公尺有多大呢？差不多等于解放以前两个半北京城的建筑面积。这种空前规模的住宅建筑，表明了党和政府是十分关心人民的住宿问题的。至于文化生活方面，仅各种剧场和电影院1955年比1950年就增加了一千三百余座（各单位及各基层工会所办的俱乐部不在内）。此外，职工的工资历年都有增加，今年就增加了13％；农民的收入也比以前增加了。凡此种种都说明了解放以后人民生活是逐年得到改善的。
    但是，必须看到我们的国家是一个落后的国家。在反动统治阶级和帝国主义者长期压迫和奴役下，我国曾经是世界上生活水平最低的国家之一。十八岁的大姑娘没有裤子穿，在解放以前并不是个别现象。差不多每年都有几十万或成百万的人饿死冻死，成百上千的人流落在街头根本没有房子住。解放以后，经过七年来的恢复和建设，我们国家的面貌已经起了根本变化，各方面都在突飞猛进，极大多数的人民已经吃得饱了，穿得暖了，有房子住了，悲惨的时代已一去不复返了。这些我们亲眼见到的事实是不用多说的。但是，这只是一面。我们还必须看到另外一面，就是我们和先进国家比较起来，我们在经济上仍然是落后的，而且不是落后五年、十年，而是落后几十年。比如，我们的重工业这几年有了很大的发展，钢的生产已从1952年的一百三十多万吨发展到今年的四百多万吨。但是，这个数字还赶不上比利时的钢产量；如果按人口平均计算，就更加落后了。我们的纺织工业是比较有基础的，解放后也有了很大的发展，可是如果按人口平均计算，产量还赶不上印度。
    我们并不怕讲出我们国家这种仍然落后的情况。我们并没有被这几年的胜利冲昏头脑而骄傲自满。我们一定要急起直追，赶上前去。我们决心把我们的国家从落后的农业国变成先进的社会主义工业国。正因为这样，我们就需要从国民收入中拿出一部分比方说20％作为积累，以便投资于建设（首先是重工业）和扩大再生产。我们不能让国民收入不适当地过多地用在日常消费方面。这就是说，对于人民生活的改善只能采取渐进的方针。必须向全体人民说清楚：不可能在短短的几年内把人民生活中的各种困难都完全解决，也不可能一下满足人民各种各样的需要。
    当然，如果不照顾人民的需要，盲目地、孤立地发展重工业，或者片面地强调加快重工业发展的速度，就会发生冒进的错误，会脱离群众危害人民的当前利益；但是，反过来，如果我们只看到人民的当前利益和个人利益，把过多的财力、物力投进生活消费中去，比如把工资提得更高些，大大增加对消费品生产和公用事业的投资，即使一时皆大欢喜，但不要多久就会产生严重的后果。因为这将严重地影响到建设的速度，影响到社会主义经济基础的巩固，危害了人民的长远利益。
    所以人民生活的改善必须是渐进的。只有这个方针才符合于我们国家的实际情况，才符合于经济发展的规律。违背了这个方针，也就是违背了人民的长远利益和集体利益。
    既然生活的改善只能是渐进的，也就是说人民生活中的一些困难不能很快都解决。那末，有许多现象，如房子挤、电车挤、吃肉吃油不方便等现象，当然也还不能马上消除。即使再过几年，那时我们的生产更发展了，劳动生产率比现在更高了，经济基础更稳固了，但是生活水平的提高仍然只能是渐进的。因为那时人们的生活需要也更多更高了。我们一定要懂得：任何时候，生活提高的程度决不能超过生产增长的程度。只有这样，才能保证我们有力量不断扩大再生产，才能使我们生活的改善建立在十分牢靠的基础上。
    目前向人民群众讲清楚这些道理是很必要的。在前一个时期，在我们的宣传工作中，特别是在一些报刊中，讲生活改善的问题讲得多了些，而讲艰苦建设讲得少了些。这就可能使人们发生某些误会，以为我们现在的经济条件已经十分好了，可以不要讲究勤俭节约了。另外，有些事情我们讲得多而又做不到或不能完全做到，比如城市房子挤的问题，即使国家可以拿出更多的钱来修宿舍，但由于水泥、砖、木等原材料供应的限制，也不可能很快地普遍地解决。这样，职工就会责怪我们是说空话。因此，提倡勤俭节约、艰苦建设，仍然是我们当前头等重要的问题。在这方面，我们的企业、机关和学校里的领导人员应当带头，发扬同群众甘苦与共的俭朴精神。我们经过艰难困苦，完成了两次伟大的革命；我们同样要以勤俭节约、克服困难的精神，把我们的国家从落后的农业国逐步建设成为一个社会主义的工业国。没有这种精神，我们的事业就会进展迟缓甚至遭受到失败。
    当然，改善生活采取渐进的方针，决不是不进，事实也并非如此。我们每年的国家预算都是照顾到人民生活需要的，我们的生活确实是逐年有所改善，今后的发展也还是如此。但是，我们不应当企望这种改善过高过快，因为这是不可能的。
    我们提倡勤俭节约、克服困难，决不是给不关心群众生活疾苦的官僚主义者找借口，让那些能办的事不办，能解决的问题不解决。相反，人民生活中迫切必需而又可能解决的问题，一定要解决。例如一些急需而又能办的职工福利设施，就应当有计划有步骤地办起来。由于计划不周、安排不当、制度不善而造成的人民生活需要方面某些紧张的状况，应当积极采取措施加以改变。
    总之，把国家建设和人民生活改善的关系放在一个正确的位置，使这两个方面适当地结合，这不仅是党和政府应当注意的重大政策问题，也是每个工人、职员和一切劳动人民都应当明了的问题。大家思想上弄清楚了，就能够勤劳奋发、坚持不懈地进行增产节约，把我们的祖国建设成一个繁荣富强的社会主义工业国，我们生活水平的更大的提高就有了切实的保证。
