    Unconquerable
    —A Record of a Trip to Japan—
    Cao Yu
    Anyone who has been to Japan will feel the beauty of Japan's natural environment and customs. I spent nearly a month in Japan, attending the conference against atomic and hydrogen bombs. I went to many places and made many friends. Almost every day I stayed in a different inn, and I often shook hands with the innkeepers to say goodbye. I had farewell conversations at train stations with elderly people seeing me off, young women holding babies, generous young people, poets and playwrights with emotions as strong as wine, and political activists and scientists who spoke and laughed cheerfully. These ordinary Japanese people, with their simplicity, sincerity, humor, and wisdom, indeed made me feel more affection for Japan. To be honest, after visiting Japan this time and seeing the environment and lives of the Japanese people today, I couldn't help but feel even more sympathy for such a Japan, rich in natural beauty and customs, now in a state of being enslaved, exploited, and suffering endless disasters.

    In Japan, few people were willing to bring up the unpleasant topic of American imperialism in front of me. However, the countryside is full of military bases established by the United States, the cities are full of advertisements for American goods, and at every train stop, you can see American soldiers and officers, escorting some pitiful, gaudily dressed "pan-pan girls" (pan-pan girls are women who rely on the American military for a living) onto the train. No matter how beautiful the scenic area, how elegant the small town, or how flower-like the coastal city, you can see American barracks, American military residences, and green weapons depots, all surrounded by barbed wire. I usually traveled by plane! But every time I got off the plane, some unpleasant phenomena pricked my eyes like needles: at the airport, American soldiers chewing gum drove cars recklessly, and American jet fighters, helicopters, and various strangely shaped aircraft moved back and forth on the airport runways. They were so arrogant that I felt they regarded Japan as a speck of dust under their feet. At the airport, Japanese temporary workers worked silently, everyone looking at these arrogant, self-proclaimed masters, their eyes seeming to want to say something, but then they lowered their heads. The sky was constantly filled with the thunderous sound of American planes, almost deafening. The American flag flew arrogantly over this beautiful land. Looking at all this, my heart was about to explode. I, as a distant guest to Japan, felt an unbearable humiliation for the masters of this land!

    Usually, our hosts and guests rarely talked about the rampant and overbearing behavior of the American military in Japan, a fact that could be seen everywhere. For them, such things were too painful and too common, so they didn't feel there was anything to talk about. Since arriving in Japan, our hearts had been filled with feelings for the kind Japanese people, so even though it was easy to encounter such things on the streets and in many situations, we couldn't bear to bring them up in front of our hosts. However, I did encounter occasions when, touched by the facts before my eyes, the smiles on the faces of our hosts suddenly disappeared, and the anger that had been suppressed in their hearts for a long time burst forth in front of me. When pain has been accumulated for a long time and reaches the point of unbearable, even a needle-like stimulus can trigger an outburst.

    One sweltering midday in the middle of a hot summer, the plane I was on descended from the cool sky to the outskirts of a city on Kyushu Island in southern Japan. Opposite us was a bare mountain with no green grass (this is rare in Japan, where there are green mountains and clear waters everywhere). The intense sunlight shone on the cement ground of the airport, making it impossible to open one's eyes. There were the same American barracks, the same groups of American planes being repaired, the same busy American cars, the same American soldiers leaning against the entrances and exits of the airport, checking the men and women workers entering and exiting, and the same deafening sound of American planes in the sky. Suddenly, an airplane far away in the sky flipped over like a vicious bird, flying so close that it grazed the roof of a farmer's small house on the hillside in the distance. After it flew away, a faint wisp of white smoke immediately rose from the thatched cottage on the hillside. A local Japanese friend exclaimed, "Look! The roof probably collapsed." Another person said heavily, "I hope only the roof was damaged, and there were no babies sleeping inside." We were far away from the hillside, and we couldn't hear the shouts of the homeowners or the sound of the house collapsing. From a distance, we could only see a wisp of white smoke. But the Japanese friend beside me couldn't help but tell me: "This is not surprising. Often at night, it is these low-flying planes that cause entire families of farmers, old and young, to die under piles of rubble without even having time to make a sound. When day breaks, distant neighbors don't see the usual smoke rising from the chimneys, and they are surprised to discover that neighbors who have lived there for decades have disappeared overnight." In the middle of summer noon in this place, the heat is unbearable. If you put a piece of raw dough on the cement road of the airport, it would seem to bake and cook before your eyes. However, a Japanese elementary school teacher, pointing to an elementary school building near the airport, said to me: "Look, the windows of the elementary school building are all tightly closed, and not a bit of air can circulate. It's as hot as an oven inside. Our children are studying in such classrooms. In order to avoid the severe interference of the plane noise, and to try to hear the teachers' lectures a little more clearly, we have no choice but to make children of a few years old endure such heat and close every window."

    In fact, it is not only the sound of airplanes that is shaking this beautiful city. The sounds of many excavators and stone drills next to the mountains also make it impossible to live in peace. However, an elderly Japanese engineer next to me said: "Only the sound would be alright." He pointed to a tunnel dug into the hillside in the distance: "That is a weapon depot recently dug by the American military. Do you know what they are going to put inside? They are going to store atomic cannons transported from the United States inside!"

    "It may explode one day, and all of us in the city will be finished!" Another person said with concern.

    However, what everyone was most worried about at the time was the expansion of the American military at this airport and the road construction, because in this way, it was not known how many families' fields, land, houses, vegetable gardens, and schools and factories along the highway would be requisitioned. In addition to anger, the faces of the owners were covered with a shadow of worry, that is, their current and future lives, their children's milk and tuition fees, and where they would be able to get them in the future. Because after losing their land where they had made a home and built a career, the city was also experiencing unemployment problems, and finding another job was almost impossible.

    The American military has more than six hundred military bases in Japan. These military bases are soaked with the countless blood and tears of the Japanese people. The establishment of every base is filled with stories of unparalleled cruelty and the angry resistance of the people. I heard the angry accusations of the farmers' representatives from Okinawa Island, and hot tears streamed down his angry face. He mentioned the forced occupation of land by the American military on Ie Island last year. Thousands of local island farmers pleaded with the fully armed American soldiers: "We can't survive if you take our land! Please don't take it away!" The enemy's guns were all loaded. In the contemptuous eyes of the enemy, this was not a group of farmers raising children and growing grain to exchange for a living, but a group of miserable and helpless lower animals that could be insulted at will. Many road rollers as big as hills roared in front of the farmers' houses, waiting for the order to advance towards the simple wooden and thatched houses that these farmers had built with several lifetimes of hard work. Regardless of the women's cries, the children's wails, and the elderly's pleas, the cold muzzles of guns were pointed at chests that had stopped beating due to shock and anger. One by one, people were forced to leave their warm land and houses by the muzzles of guns, their eyes wide open. With a command, the nightmare-like road rollers rushed towards the houses in front of them. "Houses! My houses!" Houses where farmers who had worked hard all their lives, with their hair turned white, had given birth to children and hoped to die in them, collapsed one by one with the earth-shattering sound of American road rollers transported to Japan from thousands of miles away! The cruel road rollers spared nothing, even the bamboo poles for drying clothes, the small fish in the mud jars, and the children's simple toys were crushed into powder along with the doors and windows.

    A farmer's baby was suddenly taken ill, and when the mother hurriedly put the baby at the entrance of the hospital and rushed back, she only saw the child's father standing dejectedly on a pile of bamboo chips and dirt. The home was gone.

    Weak old people did not have the strength to demonstrate to these American occupiers. They could only beg for some pity in view of their white hair. Biri Seiji - an elderly farmer in his sixties, begged and pleaded in a flustered manner, "moving his body and hands" when the American military forced the occupation of his land:

    "Don't take it away! Our family of seven only has this little piece of land. If you take it away, we won't be able to survive!"

    The elderly Biri Seiji was completely bewildered. The sudden fact of the land occupation shocked and pained him. He couldn't figure out why his piece of land was being forcibly occupied. Now he just kept repeating his pleas like an old fool.

    These foreigners did not say a word, and put the old man headfirst into a cloth bag.

    Biri Seiji was sent to the military police station for a military trial. They sued the old man, and the reasons for the lawsuit were: "(1) Infringement of American military property; (2) Incitement to residents to harm the American garrison."

    He was also accused of "violence" against an American lieutenant colonel. What violence did he commit? His only "violence" was his constant pleas to the American military, his constant pleas "moving his body and hands"!

    The farmers whose land had been occupied had no way to go. In the end, they had no choice but to adopt the so-called "strength farming inside the fence" method. They worked hard to plant taro and peanuts on the large area of land forcibly occupied by the American military. Day after day, tears and sweat made the green seedlings grow, and people's hopes also grew secretly with these seedlings. However, when these crops were about to ripen, American planes dropped gasoline on the 300,000-ping of land and ignited fierce flames, burning the green crops and the windbreak pine forests and pastures within a radius of dozens of miles. The American military said that this was done to clear the shooting range and not obstruct their line of sight. But the farmers, looking at the scorched farmland that had been burned clean, said with tears in their eyes: "It's all burned! It's all gone! But our peanuts and taro are only four inches high. We don't know how these four-inch-high things could block their line of sight when they shoot cannons?"

    These things are all carried out by American imperialism in the name of defending "freedom and democracy." But at the same time, they constantly hold lavish wine parties, tea parties, and beautiful dance parties, generously entertaining Japanese masters and carrying out "friendship" and "cooperation." There are also so-called "Japan-U.S. Technical Cooperation Institutes" in Japan. The name of this organization reminds me of places like the "Sino-American Technical Cooperation Institute" established by the United States and Kuomintang agents in Chongqing under Chiang Kai-shek's rule before liberation, where people were killed like flies. Robbers sometimes also use the pleasant terms of "science" and "civilization" to cover up their own actions. Japanese friends told me that the American military does distribute some sweets to Japanese children in the countryside of Japan. They talked coldly: "There is no poison in those sweets, and they taste sweet after eating them. Along with these sweet sweets or similar things, they want to turn our hatred for them into the kind of 'friendliness' and 'friendship' that they need."

    American imperialism has sweets of all kinds. For example, when the mass movement against atomic and hydrogen bombs was unfolding vigorously in cities across Japan, tens of millions of Japanese people in every city angrily denounced the crimes of the American military, and the conferences were held enthusiastically everywhere. This was a fact that everyone saw. But all the American-subsidized newspapers were silent and did not mention a word, but lightly reported the story of an American wealthy widow adopting an atomic disease girl. This sweet "sweet" is just like the kind of smile that American officers occasionally show to Japanese women in the occupied territories, and it does not hide any good intentions.

    Shakespeare said: "One may smile, and smile, and be a villain."

    The Japanese people have seen through the American villain. The 800,000 people on the entire island of Okinawa have awakened and want to defend their land. As they have called on people across the country, they have formed a "national total resistance." In August this year, when I was in Tokyo, I saw 120,000 Japanese workers working in American military institutions holding a demonstrative strike. On November 10th this year, I saw another moving photo in the People's Daily, a huge contingent of thousands of Japanese people, wearing "determined to die" headbands, holding hands and forming an impenetrable wall of iron, shouting like thunder: "Never give an inch of land to the American military!" This was a magnificent contingent of farmers from Sunagawa Town in the suburbs of Tokyo and workers, farmers, students, intellectuals, and members of the Diet from all over the country. They were resisting the tyranny of the American military expanding the atomic bomb aircraft airport in the suburbs of Tokyo with demonstrations of blood and anger. In two years, they raised grass mat flags with the three characters "disobedience" written on them, and awakened people all over the country. Regardless of clubs, rifle butts, bullets, bayonets, and threats to personal freedom, they persisted in their struggle and finally achieved victory on October 14th - a huge victory for the Japanese people, because the American military and the Japanese government were finally forced to abandon the order to requisition land in Sunagawa Town.

    These prove that the Japanese people's struggle against American imperialism is becoming more and more fierce day by day. The righteous patriotic sentiment is gradually burning like fire in the hearts of the people across the country, and this is just the beginning.

    The military force of American imperialism is not something that can be relied on forever. In Japan, what he sows, he will get. The American military can burn the green seedlings that Japanese farmers have worked hard to plant on the ground with gasoline. The American military can crush the houses of the Japanese people with bulldozers. It seems that everything in Japan can be conquered, extorted, and seized by the American military with force and beautiful words. But the hatred that American imperialism has sown in the hearts of every Japanese person over the past ten years, once it erupts, will turn into a raging sea of fire, and the invaders will be buried in it.

    Let these robbers taste the fruits they have planted with their own hands!

    征服不了的
    ——记日本之行——
    曹禺
    凡是到过日本的，都会感到日本的风土人情之美。我在日本将近一个月，为了开禁止原子弹氢弹的大会，到了很多地方，交结了很多朋友。几乎每天住不同的旅舍，经常和不同的旅舍的主人握手道别，和车站上相送的老人，抱着婴儿的少妇，豪爽的青年，浓情似酒的诗人、戏剧家们以及谈笑风生的政治活动家们和科学家们作临别的谈话。这些普通的日本人确实以他们的朴实、诚恳、幽默、智慧，使我对日本增加了情感。老实说，这次到了日本，看见了日本人民今天所处的环境和生活，才不由得使我更感到这样一个富于风土人情之美的日本，在今天处在一个被奴役、被压榨、受了无穷灾害的地位上，是多么值得同情。
    在日本，很少人愿意在我面前提起美帝国主义这个不愉快的题目。但是农村里到处是美国建立的军事基地，城市里到处是美国货的广告，火车每停一站，便可以看见美国的兵士、军官，挟着一些可怜的花枝招展的“乓乓女郎”走上车来（乓乓女郎是一种依靠美军生活的妇女）。无论在什么美丽的风景地区，幽雅的小城，临海的花一般的城市，到处可以看见一座一座用铁丝网拦成的美国兵营、美军住宅和绿色的军器的仓库。我总是在飞机上过着旅行生活的！但我每一下飞机，便有一些不愉快的现象像针一样刺痛着我的眼睛：飞机场上一些嚼着口香糖的美军驾着汽车横冲直撞，美国的喷气式战斗机、直升机，以及各种奇形怪状的飞机在机场的跑道上移来移去。他们是这样的目中无人，使我感觉到他们把日本看成像是脚下面的一粒灰尘。在飞机场上，日本的临时工人沉默地工作着，大家望着这些骄傲的自封为主人的外国人，眼睛里像要说出什么，但是又低下头去。天空不断响着暴雷一般的美国飞机声，几乎震聋人的耳朵。美国的国旗在这个美丽的国土上傲慢地飞扬着。望着这一切，我的心胸都要爆炸。我，作为一个来到日本的远客，我替这块土地上的主人感到不可忍受的屈辱！
    平常，我们主人与客人之间很少谈起美军在日本的横行霸道这种随处都可遇见的事实。对他们说来，这类事情因为太使人痛心了，也太普遍，反而觉得没有什么可谈的，而我们自从到了日本以后，心里一直充溢着对善良的日本人民的情感，所以虽然在街上，在很多的场合里，很容易遇见这一类的事情，也是不忍在主人面前提起。然而我也遇见过这样的场合，由于眼前事实的触动，留在主人脸上的笑容顿时收敛起来，久抑在心里的愤怒也制止不住地在我的面前迸发。痛苦积压久了，到了忍耐不住的时候，即便是针尖一样的刺激也会使人发作的。
    在一个热得喘不出气的酷夏的中午，我坐的飞机从凉爽的天空上降落在日本南部九州岛上一个城市的郊外。对面是光秃秃的不生青草的山（这在到处都是青山绿水的日本是很少见的）。强烈的阳光射在飞机场上的水泥地上，映得人睁不开眼睛。又是同样的美军的营房，同样的正在修理着的一群一群的美国飞机，同样奔忙着的美军的汽车，同样的美军在机场的出入口门上斜靠着，检查着出入的男女工人，同样的震耳欲聋的天空中美机的声音。忽然一架飞机远远地从天空中像一只恶鸟似的翻了个跟斗，紧贴着远处山坡上一座农民的小屋屋顶上擦飞过去。在它飞去后，山坡上的草舍立刻隐隐地冒了一点白烟。一个当地的日本朋友叫了一声：“你看！大概是屋顶塌了。”另外一个沉重地讲：“但愿遭害的仅仅是屋顶，下面没有正在睡觉的婴孩。”我们离着那个山坡很远，听不见房主人叫喊和屋子倒塌的声音，远远看去，不过冒了一缕白烟而已。但是在我身旁的日本朋友抑制不住地告诉我：“这太不希奇了。常常在夜里，就是这样低飞的飞机，使一家农民连老带小，来不及发出一点声音，都死在一片房倒屋塌的瓦砾堆里。天亮的时候，远处的邻居看不见平日照例的炊烟，才惊讶地发现几十年的邻居，一夜之间全家不见了。”这个地方夏天的正午，酷热难忍，如果在机场的水泥道上放上一块生面饼，就会眼看着烤熟似的。但是一个日本小学教师指着机场附近的一座小学的楼房，对我说：“你看，小学的楼房每个窗户都关得紧紧的，不能流通一点空气，里面热得像烤炉。我们的孩子们就在那样的课室里读书。为了避免飞机声音的剧烈的干扰，想勉强听清楚一点教师们的讲话的缘故，只好让几岁的孩子们忍受着这样的热，把每个窗户都关上。”
    其实，不只是飞机声音在摇撼这个美丽的城市，山岩旁边的许多掘土机、凿石机的声音，也就使人无法安居下去。但是，身旁一个日本老工程师说：“只是声音倒也罢了。”他指着远方山坡下面挖掘进去的一条隧道：“那是美军新近挖着的武器仓库，你们知道里面将要放什么东西吗？那里面就要储藏从美国运来的原子炮呢！”
    “也可能有一天爆炸起来，我们全城的人都会完了吧！”另一个人这样忧虑地讲着。
    然而，大家当时最忧虑的是美军在这个飞机场上的扩建问题和筑路问题，因为这样一来，不知要征用多少家的田产、土地、房屋、菜园以及公路边上的学校和工厂。主人们的脸上除了愤怒之外，又罩上了一层忧虑的阴影，那就是眼前和将来的生活，孩子们的牛奶和学费，日后从什么地方可以得到。因为失去了自己成家立业的土地以后，城里也正在闹着失业的问题，另谋职业几乎是不可能的。
    美军在日本的军事基地达到六百多个。这些军事基地的土地上浸透了数不清的日本人民的血泪，没有一个基地的建立不是充满了人间罕有的残暴和老百姓愤怒的抵抗的故事。我听见冲绳岛的农民代表的愤怒的控诉，他愤怒的脸上流着纵横的热泪。他提起去年美军在伊江岛的强行占地，千万个当地岛上的农民向全付武装的美兵哀求：“拿去我们的土地就活不下去了！请你们别收去吧！”敌人的枪弹个个上了膛，在敌人轻蔑的眼睛前面这不是一群养老育幼、种植着谷实来换取生活的农民，而是一群凄惨无告、可以随便凌辱的低等动物。多少个像小山一样的压路机轰轰地在农民的房舍面前响着，等着号令向这些农民用好几辈子的辛苦盖成的简陋的木舍草屋推进。不顾女人们的哭喊，孩子们的号啕，老年人的哀求，冰冷的枪口顶在由于震惊、愤怒使得心都停止了跳动的胸口上。一个个的人睁大着眼睛，被枪口逼着离开了自己温暖的土地和房屋。一声号令，恶梦一般的压路机向眼前的房屋冲过去。“房屋啊！我的房屋啊！”一生辛苦，白了头发的农民在里面生儿育女，指望着在里面送终的房屋啊，就随着万里运到日本的美国压路机的震耳的声音，一座一座地倒下去！残酷的压路机什么都没有放过，连晒衣服的竹竿、泥罐里的小鱼，和小孩子简陋的玩具都和门板窗棂一起压成粉碎。
    一个农妇的婴儿得了急病，等到妈妈匆匆忙忙把婴儿放在医院门口就赶回来的时候，只看见孩子的父亲在一堆竹片土块的残迹上垂头立着。家，已经没有了。
    衰弱的老人家是没有气力再向这些美国占领者示威了，他们只有求看在白发的份上得到一些怜悯。并里清二——一位六十多岁的老农民在美军强迫占用他的土地的时候，慌乱的“身子也动手也动”地哀求着，央告着：
    “别收去吧！我们一家七口只有这一点土地，收走了，就活不下去啦！”
    年老的并里清二完全迷惑了，突然占地的事实使他震惊、痛苦。他想不出他的这块土地为什么要被人强占去，现在只是不断地像一个年老的痴子似地重复他的央告。
    这些外国人没有作声，用一个布袋迎头就把老人装进去了。
    并里清二被送到军事警察署，进行了军事审判。他们向这个老人起诉了，起诉的理由是：“（一）侵犯了美国军事财产；（二）向居民做了危害美军驻扎部队的煽动。”
    他还被控对美军中校犯了“暴行”。他犯了什么暴行呢？他唯一的“暴行”就是对美军不断地央告，“身子也动手也动”地不断地央告！
    被占了地的农民们已经无路可走了，最后只有采取所谓“栅内实力农耕”的办法。他们就在美军强占的大片的土地上，又辛辛苦苦地种上芋头和花生。一天一天的眼泪和汗使这一片一片绿色的嫩苗生长起来，人的希望跟着这些嫩苗也偷偷地生长起来。然而在这些农作物快成熟的时候，美国的飞机在三十万坪的土地上撒下汽油，燃起剧烈的火焰，把方圆数十里绿油油的庄稼和防风的松林、牧草，一起烧得干干净净。美军说，这样做是为了扫清射击场，不阻碍他们的视线。但是那些农民望着烧净了的焦黑的农田，泪眼婆娑地说：“烧完了！净光了！但我们的花生和芋头不过四寸高，我们不知道这四寸高的东西怎么可能挡住他们射击大炮时候的视线？”
    这些事情都是美帝在保卫“自由和民主主义”的名义下进行的。但同时，他们经常不断地开丰盛的酒会、茶会和漂亮的舞会，盛情款待着日本的主人，进行“友好”与“合作”。在日本也有所谓“日美技术合作所”的组织，这种组织的名字叫我联想起在解放以前，蒋介石统治下，美国与国民党特务在重庆设立的“中美技术合作所”之类，杀人如麻的地方。强盗们有时也要用“科学”、“文明”的动听的名词来遮掩自己的。日本朋友们告诉我，美军在日本的农村里确实也散给日本孩子们一些糖果。他们冷冷地谈着：“那些糖果里并没有什么毒物，吃了以后也是令人觉得甜的。随着这些甜的糖果或类似的东西，他们想把我们对他们的仇恨变成他们所须要的那种‘亲善’和‘友好’。”
    美帝国主义的糖果是有各式各样的，比方说，在禁止原子弹氢弹的群众运动在日本全国各个城市里如火如荼地展开起来的时候，每个城市有千千万万的日本人愤怒地控诉美军的罪行，大会在各地热烈地开着，这是谁都看见的事实。但所有美国津贴的报纸都沉默着，一字不提，却轻描淡写地报道着一个美国富孀收养了一个原子病少女的事情。这一块甜甜的“糖果”正像美国军官在占领地偶而对日本妇女露出的那种微笑，是并没有藏着什么良好的意图的。
    莎士比亚说：“一个人可以微笑，微笑，但他还是个恶棍。”
    美国这个恶棍，日本人民是看透了的。冲绳全岛的八十万人民已经觉醒起来，要保卫自己的土地。像他们对全国人士所号召的，已经形成“民族的总抵抗”了。今年8月，我在东京的时候，看见了十二万个在美军机构里工作的日本工人举行着示威性的罢工。今年11月10日，我在人民日报上又看见一幅动人的照片，成千上万的日本人民的庞大的队伍，头上扎着“决死”的头巾，手挽着手，结成一层铜墙铁壁，雷一般地喊着：“决不交给美军一寸土地！”这是东京郊外砂川町的农民和从全国各地来的工人、农民、学生、知识分子和国会议员结成的轰轰烈烈的队伍，他们在用鲜血和愤怒的示威来抵抗美军在东京郊外扩大原子弹飞机机场的暴政。两年的功夫，他们举起草席做的大旗，上面写着“不服从”三个大字，把全国人民都叫醒了。不顾木棍、枪托、子弹、刺刀，和对人身自由的威胁，他们坚持斗争，终于在10月14日得到了胜利——日本人民巨大的胜利，因为美军和日本政府终于被迫放弃了征收砂川町土地的命令。
    这些，证明了日本人民对美帝国主义的斗争一天比一天猛烈。正义的爱国的情感像火一样地在全国人民的心里逐渐燃烧起来，这不过是开端而已。
    美帝国主义的武力并不是永远可靠的东西，在日本，他种下什么，他就会得到什么。日本农民辛辛苦苦在地上播种出来的青苗，美军是可以用汽油烧光的。日本人民的房屋，美军是可以用推土机碾倒的。仿佛日本的一切都可以由美军用武力和美丽的言词来征服，来巧取豪夺。但是深深地藏在每一个日本人心里的、美帝国主义在这十几年来所种下的仇恨，一旦爆发起来，将会变成一片熊熊的火海，侵略者们都会葬身在里面的。
    让这些强盗们尝一尝自己亲手种的果实吧！
