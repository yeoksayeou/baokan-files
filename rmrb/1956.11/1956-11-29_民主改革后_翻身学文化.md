    After Democratic Reform, Emancipated People Learn Culture
    This newspaper reports: Five hundred Yi people who were once slaves have been liberated in the democratic reform movement and entered the Leibo County National Cadre School. After two months of study, they can already read the new Yi language newspaper and write letters in the new Yi language (note: the new Yi language is a script created with the help of the government after liberation for the Yi people, and is deeply loved by the Yi people). Now, they have begun to study arithmetic, and in the future they will also study abacus and the accounting business of agricultural cooperatives. After graduation, this group of Yi students will become the backbone for leading Yi farmers on the road to collectivization.

    The Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture is located in the southwest of Sichuan Province, including fourteen counties, with an area of approximately 35,000 square kilometers. The population is over one million, of which about 800,000 are Yi people, in addition to Han and a small number of Miao and Hui people. Before liberation, the vast majority of them lived a primitive slave society life. After liberation, the policy of national regional autonomy was implemented. In April 1955, according to the provisions of the Constitution, the Liangshan Yi Autonomous Region was changed to an Autonomous Prefecture. Since the beginning of this year, democratic reforms have been implemented here, and new developments have been made in all aspects of work.

    民主改革后　翻身学文化
    本报讯　曾经是奴隶的五百名彝民，在民主改革运动中获得了解放，进入雷波县民族干部学校，他们经过两个月的学习，已能看懂新彝文报和用新彝文写信了（按新彝文是解放后政府帮助彝族人民创造的一种文字，深受彝民爱戴）。现在，他们已开始学习算术，今后还要学习珠算和农业社的会计业务。这批彝族学员在结业后，将成为领导彝族农民走合作化道路的骨干。

    凉山彝族自治州，位于四川省的西南部，包括十四个县，面积约三万五千平方公里。人口一百多万，除汉族及少数苗、回族外，彝族人口约八十万。解放前，他们绝大多数都过着原始社会的奴隶生活。解放后，推行了民族区域自治政策，1955年4月，根据宪法的规定，把凉山彝族自治区改为自治州。从今年年初开始，这里又实行了民主改革，各方面工作都有了新的发展。
