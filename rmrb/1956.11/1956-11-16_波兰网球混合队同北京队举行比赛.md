    (Our dispatch) The Polish tennis mixed team, visiting our country for the first time, held two exciting men's singles friendly matches with the Beijing team at the Beijing Institute of Physical Education gymnasium on the afternoon of the 15th. The results of the matches were Mężyński defeating Kwiatek two sets to zero, and Skonecki defeating Wu Shengkang two sets to zero (both best-of-three sets).

    The young Polish first-class athlete, Janusz Kwiatek, had accurate and powerful serves and was good at seizing the initiative to go to the net, but his backhand technique was not skilled enough. Mężyński observed his opponent's weakness shortly after the start of the match and repeatedly attacked his opponent's backhand. Sometimes he suddenly changed direction, smashing the ball like lightning to his opponent's right-corner forehand, or unexpectedly slicing a net-skimming ball, thus winning the first set six to zero. In the second set, Kwiatek tried to compensate for his backhand shortcomings by intercepting at the net as much as possible. However, his backhand slice was not as good as his opponent's, and the opponent's use of lobs created many difficulties for him at the net, and he eventually lost six to three.

    The second match was between the Polish athlete Skonecki and Wu Shengkang, the 1956 Chinese men's singles champion. Skonecki was the runner-up in the 1956 All-Poland Tennis Men's Singles, and the runner-up in the European Men's Singles in 1954 and 1955. He has represented Poland in the Davis Cup five times and has defeated famous players from Australia, Sweden, Italy, and the United States in international friendly matches. Yesterday, his first meeting with the capital's audience left a deep impression. His skill and mastery of techniques and tactics have indeed reached a superb level. His serves are like bullets fired from a gun, almost always accurate and rarely missing. Although Skonecki had the upper hand in technique, Wu Shengkang remained calm and fiercely returned the blows. Sometimes Skonecki watched Wu Shengkang's corner shots fly by at the net, unable to return them in time, and raised his thumb in admiration. The result of this match was six to two and six to three, with Skonecki winning two sets in a row.

    A grand welcoming ceremony was held before the matches. Huang Qixiang, Deputy Director of the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission, delivered a welcoming speech at the meeting. Józef Rutkowski, member of the Presidium of the Polish Supreme Sports Committee and Director of the Sports Department of the Polish Central Council of Trade Unions, also spoke.

    波兰网球混合队同北京队举行比赛
    本报讯　首次访问我国的波兰网球混合队，15日下午在北京体育学院田径馆内同北京队举行了两场精采的男子单打友谊比赛。比赛结果是梅福基以二比零胜克维亚特克，斯科涅茨基以二比零胜吴生康（都是三盘两胜制）。
    年青的波兰一级运动员亚努什·克维亚特克发球准确有力，善于争取上网的主动权，但是反手击球的技术却不够熟练。梅福基在比赛开始不久便观察出对方的弱点，一再强攻对方的反手，有时又突然改变方向，闪电般抽往对方右角正手，或者出人意料地轻轻削出一个近网球，因此以六比零胜第一盘。第二盘克维亚特克尽量利用上网拦击来弥补反手的不足，无奈反手削球的功夫不如对方，加上对方运用打高吊球的方法，造成上网的很多困难，终以六比三败北。
    第二场比赛是波兰运动健将斯科涅茨基对1956年我国男子单打冠军吴生康。斯科?茨基是1956年全波兰网球男子单打亚军，1954年和1955年蝉联欧洲男子单打亚军，他曾五次代表波兰参加台维斯杯比赛，在国际友谊比赛中曾经打败过澳大利亚、瑞典、意大利和美国的著名选手。昨天他第一次同首都观众见面，就给人留下很深的印象。他的技术和战术的熟练确实已经达到了炉火纯青的地步。他发的球像射出的弹丸一样，几乎是百发百中，很少失误。虽然斯科涅茨基在技术上占着上风，但是吴生康始终不慌不忙，狠狠地还击，有时斯科涅茨基在网前目送吴生康抽来的角球，来不及还击，也伸出大姆指赞叹不已。这一场比赛结果是六比二和六比三，斯科?茨基连胜两盘。
    在比赛以前举行了隆重的欢迎仪式。中央体育运动委员会副主任黄琪翔在会上致欢迎词，波兰最高体育委员会主席团委员、波兰工会中央理事会体育部部长约瑟夫·鲁特科夫斯基也讲了话。
