　　Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, November 10th. Indian Prime Minister Nehru, at a working committee meeting of the Indian National Congress in Calcutta on November 9th, again accused Britain of "resuming gunboat diplomacy," saying that Britain's actions against Egypt were wrong. He also said: "I am glad that there are many people in the United Kingdom who do not like Britain's actions in Egypt."
　　Nehru's remarks were made after the working committee passed a resolution demanding the withdrawal of the aggressive troops of Britain, France, and Israel from Egypt.
　　Nehru, on behalf of the Indian people, paid tribute to the Egyptian people, praising them for "remaining calm under bombardment," and expressed admiration for Egyptian President Nasser.
　　Speaking about the collusion of Israel, Britain, and France in attacking Egypt, Nehru said: "I have no evidence to assert that the aggression carried out by Israel was the result of such an agreement, but what happened has aroused suspicion."
　　Nehru pointed out that the reasons put forward by Britain and France for taking action against Egypt were "bizarre." He said that according to this "reason," Israel could penetrate 140 miles into Egyptian territory, and Egypt would also have to cede some territory along the Suez Canal to Britain and France.
　　Nehru said: "We sympathize with Egypt. They are friendly to us, and we feel that they have indeed been violated."
　　Nehru said that the Indian people should "not be too sure" that the current improvement in the international situation, especially the Egyptian crisis, will continue.
　　At the working committee meeting of the National Congress, a proposal was made to sever India's relationship with the British Commonwealth. Nehru said that he understood the feelings of those who demanded withdrawal from the Commonwealth. He said that those people's feelings "are a strong reaction of anger." Nehru said that he did not want India to leave the Commonwealth "unless circumstances force us to do so." He said, "It would be wrong for this committee to make that decision."
　　Nehru accused the French authorities of arresting five leaders of the Algerian National Liberation Front as "air piracy and banditry."
　　In his speech on the international situation, Nehru also expressed his views on the recent situation in Hungary.
　　Nehru said that he did not fully understand the situation in Hungary. However, he also said, "I very much dislike foreign troops interfering in Hungarian affairs."

    尼赫鲁总理再次指责英国“恢复炮舰外交”
    并痛斥法国当局逮捕阿尔及利亚民族领袖是“空中强盗和土匪”行为
    新华社新德里10日电　印度总理尼赫鲁11月9日在加尔各答召开的印度国大党工作委员会上再次指责英国“恢复炮舰外交”，他说，英国对埃及的行动是错误的。他还说：“我高兴，在联合王国也有许多人不喜欢英国在埃及的行动。”
    尼赫鲁的讲话是在工作委员会通过要求英法和以色列侵略军队撤离埃及的决议以后发表的。
    尼赫鲁代表印度人民向埃及人民致敬，称赞他们“在轰炸之下保持冷静”，并且对埃及总统纳赛尔表示钦佩。
    尼赫鲁在谈到关于以色列、英国和法国互相勾结进攻埃及的时候说：“我举不出证据来断言以色列所进行的侵略是这样一种协议的结果，但是所发生的事情却令人产生了猜疑。”
    尼赫鲁指出，英法两国提出的对埃及采取行动的理由是“离奇的”。他说，因为根据这种“理由”，以色列可以深入埃及境内一百四十英里，而且埃及还必须把在苏伊士运河沿岸的一些领土让给英法两国。
    尼赫鲁说：“我们是同情埃及这一方面的。他们对我们友好，我们感觉，他们的确是受到了侵害。”
    尼赫鲁说，印度人民“不要过于肯定地相信”国际局势特别是埃及危机中目前的改善会持续下去。
    在国大党工作委员会上有人提出了断绝印度和英联邦关系的提案。尼赫鲁说，他了解那些要求退出英联邦的人的心情。他说那些人的心情“是强烈的愤怒的反应”。尼赫鲁表示，他不希望印度脱离英联邦，“除非情况迫使我们那样作”。他说，“如果这个委员会作出那种决定，那将是错误的”。
    尼赫鲁指责法国当局逮捕五位阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线领袖是“空中强盗和土匪”的行为。
    尼赫鲁在关于国际形势的演说中还对匈牙利的最近情况发表了他的看法。
    尼赫鲁说，他不完全了解匈牙利国内的局势。但是，他又说，“我十分不喜欢外国军队干涉匈牙利事务”。
