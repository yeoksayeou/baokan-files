    Egypt, Egypt! ...
    Bao Chang
    One day in October, the Red Sea was evaporating heat,
    In the Suez Canal, ships were coming and going freely,
    Mount Sinai, still so solemn and quiet,
    Suddenly, a plume of black smoke rises from your border,
    Egypt, Egypt! What calamity has befallen your land?
    A string of incendiary bombs burst in the fields,
    Olive groves are immediately crisscrossed with corpses.
    The black-clad peasant woman falls in a pool of blood,
    The baby sucking at her nipple cries desperately.
    Egypt, Egypt! You have suffered a sudden attack!
    Those are Israeli soldiers with red-streaked eyes,
    And "heroes" wearing royal military emblems, "brave men" addicted to champagne,
    They light Ku Klux Klan-style fiery crosses, and rush towards you,
    Muttering the mad ravings of a "Middle East colonial empire."
    Egypt, Egypt! Your opponent is as fierce as a demon!
    Don't be fooled by the rustling of their tailcoats,
    Who can call them human – this group of pointed-headed gentlemen!
    They take off their white gloves, revealing hairy arms,
    And hurl heavy-weight killing bombs at Cairo elementary schools.
    Egypt, Egypt! Your enemy is unprecedentedly despicable!
    In these days, all the good people in the world,
    Are watching you—the awakened children of the Nile.
    We wait for the newspaper in the morning and guard the radio at night,
    Listening to every dispatch, excited and anxious.
    Egypt, Egypt! The people of the whole world are concerned about you!
    Our tears often well up in our eyes,
    When we see Egyptian commandos swearing an oath under the sun in photographs.
    Oh, what in the world is more beautiful and magnificent than this!
    Your free children are fighting bravely against the enemy, singing war songs.
    Egypt, Egypt! Praise you, glory and justice!
    We are happy to hear that you have annihilated a batch of enemy planes,
    Hurray! We immediately cheer, our hearts filled with ecstasy.
    Although there are still many difficulties in front of you,
    But we firmly believe: you will surely win the final victory.
    Egypt, Egypt! Fly, your green land star and crescent flag.
    The mighty Nile River, as long as China's Yangtze River,
    The magnificent pyramids, bring honor to mankind together with the Great Wall.
    In the long years, the two great nations have drunk from the cup of suffering together,
    In the torch of liberation, we will forge an unbreakable friendship.
    Egypt, Egypt! Believe it, six hundred million Chinese people will always be with you!

    埃及，埃及！……
    鲍昌
    十月里的一天，红海在蒸发热气，
    苏伊士运河里，轮船在自由地来去，
    圣西奈山，还是那样的庄严肃静，
    忽然间，一片黑烟从你的边陲上升起，
    埃及，埃及！什么灾难降临在你的土地？
    一串烧夷弹在田野上炸开，
    橄榄园里立刻纵横着尸体。
    那穿着黑衣的农妇在血泊里倒下，
    吮着她奶头的婴儿没命的悲啼。
    埃及，埃及！你遭受了突然的袭击！
    那是些眼睛布满红丝的以色列兵，
    和戴着皇家军徽的“英雄”、迷恋着香槟酒的“勇士”，
    他们烧起三K党式的火十字架，扑向了你，
    嘴里咀嚼着“中东殖民帝国”的疯狂的呓语。
    埃及，埃及！你的对手像恶魔般的凶厉！
    别看他们穿的燕尾服悉索作响，
    有谁能管他们叫作人——这群尖头绅士！
    他们脱下白手套，露出毛茸茸的手臂，
    用重磅的杀伤弹，向开罗小学校投去。
    埃及，埃及！你的敌人是空前的卑鄙！
    这些天来，世界上所有善良的人们，
    都在注视你——尼罗河畔的觉醒了的儿女。
    我们早上等着报纸，晚上守着收音机，
    倾听每一则电讯，激动而且焦急。
    埃及，埃及！全世界的人民都在关怀着你！
    我们的眼泪时常在眼眶里打转，
    当我们在照片上看到埃及敢死队在太阳底下宣誓。
    呵，世界上还有什么比这更美、更壮丽！
    你自由的儿女唱着战歌奋勇抗敌。
    埃及，埃及！赞美你呵，光荣和正义！
    我们高兴地听到，你歼灭了一批敌机，
    万岁！我们立刻欢呼，心中充满狂喜。
    尽管你面前还摆有重重的困难，
    但我们坚信：你必然取得最后的胜利。
    埃及，埃及！飘扬吧，你的绿地星月旗。
    浩荡的尼罗河啊，和中国的长江一样漫长，
    雄伟的金字塔啊，和长城一同给人类带来荣誉。
    在悠久岁月里，两大民族同饮过痛苦之杯，
    在解放的火炬中，我们更会结成无间的友谊。
    埃及，埃及！相信吧，六亿中国人民永远和你在一起！
