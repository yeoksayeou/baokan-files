China's Largest Ore Dressing Plant Goes into Production

　　China's largest ore dressing plant to date, the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Dagushan Ore Dressing Plant, was put into full production on October 30th.

　　The Dagushan Iron Mine is Anshan Iron and Steel's largest ore base. This ore dressing plant can transform the lean iron ore produced by the Dagushan Iron Mine, through processes such as crushing, screening, ball milling, classification, and magnetic separation, into concentrate powder with an iron content of about 60%. Finally, it is sintered to become artificial rich ore, which is sent to the blast furnace for iron smelting. After this ore dressing plant is put into production, the concentrate powder produced in one year can meet the production needs of two automated blast furnaces at Anshan Iron and Steel.

　　This ore dressing plant, built with Soviet assistance, is highly mechanized and automated, with almost all equipment equipped with automatic control instruments. (Xinhua News Agency)

Harbin Electric Machinery Plant's First Phase Project Basically Completed

　　The first phase of the construction project of the state-owned Harbin Electric Machinery Plant has been basically completed. This is the first and largest electric motor manufacturing plant in China that was completely designed by our own country.

　　The construction work of the first phase of the Harbin Electric Machinery Plant lasted for more than five years. The various workshops that were started at different times successively began production after construction, which enabled the investment to be effective as early as possible and supplied the needs of power station equipment in the national construction.

　　In the past five years, the total value created by the Harbin Electric Machinery Plant in production is equivalent to the state's investment in the plant in the past five years. (Heilongjiang Daily)

Construction of the First Modern Machine Tool Casting Plant

　　China's first modern machine tool casting factory will be built in Nanjing. Preparations for the construction of the factory are currently underway. It is expected to be officially put into production in 1959.

　　After this factory is put into production, it can use the steel from Ma'anshan to produce tens of thousands of tons of cast products for state-owned machine tool factories in Shanghai, Nanjing, Wuxi, and other places every year, and it will also have the capacity to undertake some collaborative tasks for the local machinery industry. Therefore, after this factory is built, the casting processes of the machine tool factories along the Shanghai-Nanjing line can be cancelled, allowing them to more fully exert their production potential.

Shanghai to Build a Large Leather Shoe Factory

　　A large-scale leather shoe factory in Shanghai—the joint state-private Shanghai No. 1 Shoe Factory—will complete its basic construction work this month and be put into production at the beginning of next month. After this factory starts production, its annual output can reach about one-seventh of the total output of Shanghai's entire shoe-making industry.

　　This factory was built by repairing and expanding an old factory building vacated by a leather factory. After the factory building is completed, some of the new joint state-private shoe factories with poor production conditions will be moved here to produce. In this way, not only can the working conditions of these factories be significantly improved, but also management personnel can be saved, which will facilitate technical exchanges and the organization of assembly line production, thereby greatly improving labor productivity and product quality, and reducing management costs.

　　The investment in the construction of this factory is less than 100,000 yuan. It is estimated that all investment can be fully recovered within nine months after production. (Liberation Daily)

Shanghai Tool Factory Expands Fivefold

　　The state-owned Shanghai Tool Factory, which is famous for manufacturing various precision cutting tools, has recently completed a new factory with an area five times larger than the old factory by adopting the method of expanding while producing over the past three years.

　　The newly built factory is equipped with broaching machines, shaping machines, gear shaper cutter special grinding machines, and extremely precise measuring instruments, which are rare in other factories. According to design requirements, the factory will produce more than 440 tons of precision cutting tools per year. (People's Navigation News)

    工矿建设动态
    我国最大的选矿厂投入生产
    我国目前最大的选矿厂——鞍钢大孤山选矿厂在10月30日全部投入生产。
    大孤山铁矿是鞍钢目前最大的矿石基地。这座选矿厂能够把大孤山铁矿生产出来的贫铁矿石，经过破碎、筛分、球磨、分级和磁选等生产过程，变成含铁量达到60％左右的精矿粉，最后经过烧结而成为人造富矿，送到高炉去炼铁。这座选矿厂投入生产后，一年生产的精矿粉，可供鞍钢两座自动化高炉生产的需要。
    这座由苏联帮助我国建设起来的选矿厂是高度机械化自动化的，差不多所有设备都装有自动控制仪表。　　（新华社）
    哈尔滨电机厂第一期工程基本完成
    国营哈尔滨电机厂第一期建厂工程已经基本上完成。这是第一座完全由我国自己设计的、国内最大的电机制造厂。
    哈尔滨电机厂第一期工程的建设工作历时五年多。在先后不同时期开建的各个车间，都是在建设后分别开始了生产，这使得投资得以尽早发挥效用，并供应了国家建设中电站设备的需要。
    五年来，哈尔滨电机厂在生产中创造的总价值已相当于国家五年来在该厂的投资。（黑龙江日报）
    兴建第一座近代化机床铸件厂
    我国第一座近代化的机床铸件工厂，将在南京市兴建。现在建厂准备工作正在紧张进行。预计在1959年可正式投入生产。
    这个工厂投入生产以后，就可以用马鞍山的钢铁，每年为上海、南京、无锡等地的国营机床厂生产数万吨的铸造成品，并且还有余力承担部分地方机械工业的协作任务。因此，这个厂建成后，现在沪宁沿线各机床厂的铸件工序就可取消，使他们更充分地发挥生产潜力。（史）
    上海兴建一座大皮鞋厂
    上海市一座规模很大的皮鞋厂——公私合营上海第一制鞋厂，将于本月内完成基本建设工程，下月初投入生产。这个工厂开始生产后，年产量可达到上海市全市制鞋工业总产量的七分之一左右。
    这个工厂是利用一家皮革厂腾出的旧厂房，修缮和扩建成的。厂房建成后，部分目前生产条件较差的新公私合营制鞋厂，将迁并到这里生产。这样，不仅这些工厂的劳动条件可以得到显著改善，而且可以节省管理人员，便于开展技术交流和组织流水生产，从而大大提高劳动生产率和产品质量，降低管理费用。
    建设这个工厂，投资不到十万元。预计全部投资在生产后九个月内就可以全部收回。（解放日报）
    上海工具厂扩大五倍
    素以制造各种精密切削工具著名的国营上海工具厂，三年来采取边生产边扩建的办法，最近建成了一座面积比老厂大五倍的新厂。
    建成的新厂，安装了其他工厂少有的拉床、铲床、插齿刀专门磨床，以及极其精密的计量仪器等设备。按照设计要求，这个工厂一年生产的精密切削工具，将要达到四百四十吨以上。（人民航运报）
