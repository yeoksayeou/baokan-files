    What is the Treaty of Peace with Hungary?
    Some readers have written to ask what the Treaty of Peace with Hungary is. Here is a brief answer:
    After the failure of the Hungarian Soviet Republic in 1919, Hungary entered a dark era of twenty-five years of fascist dictatorship under Horthy. In 1933, the Hitler gang seized power in Germany, and Hungary was controlled by the German fascist forces, becoming a vassal state of Hitler's Germany and a base for invading European countries.
    From June 1941, the Hungarian army participated in the fascist German invasion of the Soviet Union, committing crimes on Soviet territory along with the Hitlerite army. The fascist offensive was met with a strong counterattack from the Soviet army and people. The Hitlerite army was defeated, and the Horthy ruling clique collapsed. Hungary was finally liberated by the Soviet army in 1945.
    On February 10, 1947, the Allied powers, including the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, the United States, Australia, the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic, Canada, Czechoslovakia, India, New Zealand, the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, the Union of South Africa, and the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia, signed the Treaty of Peace with Hungary.
    The treaty pointed out that Hungary, as an accomplice of Hitler's Germany and a participant in the war against the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, the United States, and other United Nations countries, should bear a certain responsibility for this war. According to the treaty, the borders of Hungary were restored to their state on January 1, 1938. The treaty made fair provisions for the size of the Hungarian army, for ensuring Hungarian cooperation with the Allied powers to prevent Germany from rearming abroad, for the withdrawal and stationing of Allied forces, and for reparations.
    During the discussion of the draft of the Treaty of Peace with Hungary, the US-British bloc put forward unfair conditions. However, thanks to the efforts of the Soviet Union, the treaty ensured that Hungary embarked on the road to independence, democracy, and anti-fascism.
  　Article 2 of the treaty stipulates that "Hungary shall take all measures necessary to secure to all persons under Hungarian jurisdiction, without distinction as to race, sex, language or religion, the enjoyment of human rights and of the fundamental freedoms, including freedom of expression, of press and publication, of religious worship, of political opinion and of public meeting."
    The treaty also put forward clauses to guarantee these democratic rights. Article 4 of the treaty stipulates that "Hungary, in accordance with the Armistice Agreement, has dissolved all Fascist-type organizations – political, military, paramilitary, and other organizations conducting propaganda hostile to the United Nations, including revisionist propaganda – in Hungarian territory, and Hungary undertakes not to permit in future the existence and activities of organizations of that nature which have as their aim the deprivation of the democratic rights of the people."
    Recently, the Hungarian Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Government and the Hungarian people, with the help of the Soviet army, defeated the restoration plot of counter-revolutionary elements and fascist elements supported by imperialism, and defended the Hungarian people's democratic system. The imperialists, in their disappointment, are clamoring about "human rights violations in Hungary." However, as the Soviet representative Sobolev said at the United Nations meeting: "The Hungarian government has taken measures to stop the criminal activities of counter-revolutionary elements, and its actions are fully in accordance with the treaty. According to the treaty, Hungary has the responsibility not to allow the existence and activities of fascist-type organizations that aim to deprive the Hungarian people of their democratic rights."

    什么是对匈和约？
    有的读者来信问到什么是对匈和约，现简答如下：
    1919年匈牙利苏维埃共和国失败后，匈牙利就进入了为时二十五年的霍尔蒂法西斯独裁统治的黑暗时代。1933年，希特勒匪帮在德国夺取了政权，匈牙利又被德国法西斯势力所控制，变为希特勒德国的仆从国和侵略欧洲各国的一个基地。
    从1941年6月起，匈牙利军队参加了法西斯德寇进犯苏联的战争，同希特勒军队一起在苏联国土上为非做恶。法西斯的进攻，遭到了苏联军队和人民强有力的回击，希特勒军队被击溃了，霍尔蒂统治集团也随之垮台。匈牙利终于在1945年为苏军所解放。
    1947年2月10日，苏联、英国、美国、澳大利亚、白俄罗斯苏维埃社会主义共和国、加拿大、捷克斯洛伐克、印度、新西兰、乌克兰苏维埃社会主义共和国、南非联邦、南斯拉夫联邦人民共和国等同盟国家与匈牙利签订了对匈和约。
    和约指出，匈牙利作为希特勒德国的帮凶，并且参加了反对苏联、英国、美国和其他联合国国家的战争，对这次战争应负一定的责任。根据和约，匈牙利的边疆恢复了1938年1月1日的原状。和约对于匈牙利军队的数量、对于保证匈牙利与同盟国合作以防止德国在境外恢复武装、对于同盟国家的撤军和驻军以及赔款等问题都作了公正的规定。
    在商讨对匈和约草案的时候，美英集团曾提出了不公平的条件。但在苏联的努力下，使和约保证了匈牙利走上独立、民主和反法西斯的道路。
  　和约第二条规定，“匈牙利有责任采取一切必要措施，保证在匈牙利管辖下的所有的人，不论种族、性别、语言或宗教信仰的区别，都享有人权和基本自由，包括言论、出版、宗教信仰、政治信仰和公开集会的自由”。
    和约也提出了保障这些民主权利的条款。和约第四条规定，“匈牙利根据停战协定，采取了措施解散匈牙利境内所有的法西斯类型的组织：政治的、军事的、军事化的、以及其他进行反对联合国的宣传，包括修正主义宣传的组织；匈牙利有责任在今后也不容许以剥夺人民的民主权利为目的的法西斯类型的组织存在和活动”。
    最近，匈牙利工农革命政府和匈牙利人民，在苏军帮助下，击败了得到帝国主义支持的反革命分子和法西斯分子的复辟阴谋，保卫了匈牙利的人民民主制度。帝国主义分子在失望之际，竟大嚷什么“在匈牙利人权遭到破坏”。但是，正如苏联代表索波列夫在联合国会议上所说：“匈牙利政府采取了措施来制止反革命分子的罪恶活动，它的行动完全符合和约的。根据和约，匈牙利有责任不容许以剥夺匈牙利人民的民主权利为目的的法西斯类型的组织存在和活动。”（方萱）
