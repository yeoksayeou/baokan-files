Xinhua News Agency, Paris, November 9th: TASS reports: Some reactionary groups in France, using the failure of the counter-revolutionary riots in Hungary as a pretext, are carrying out fascist attacks on the French Communist Party.

On the evening of November 7th, a group of anti-communist thugs in Paris attacked the office of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party. The thugs broke down the door, smashed a lot of furniture and equipment, and set fire to the building. The offices of "l'Humanité" and "Libération" were also destroyed by the thugs. Reactionaries also attacked the buildings of communist organizations in other cities. In Strasbourg, reactionaries tried to destroy the office of "Alsace-Lorraine l'Humanité," but failed because all the staff of the newspaper's editorial department fought back and drove away the thugs.

The working people of France have expressed great indignation at these fascist atrocities. On the 7th, the working people of Paris organized demonstrations against these atrocities. Demonstrators clashed with fascist thugs, and some people were injured in the clashes.

No newspapers were published in Paris on the morning of the 8th because the workers of the Paris newspaper printing plants declared a one-day strike to protest the reactionary attacks on "l'Humanité" and "Libération."

On the evening of the 8th, despite the police authorities' prohibition, the working people of Paris held a large demonstration in one of Paris's largest squares—the Place de la République. Thousands of workers, patriots, and democrats gathered in the Place de la République and neighboring streets, determined to give the reactionary forces a strong rebuff. Everywhere, the slogan "No Fascist Lawlessness!" could be heard. A large number of police gathered in the Place de la République and attempted to disperse the demonstrators, resulting in clashes. The demonstrators sang "La Marseillaise" and "The Internationale" as they marched through several streets and boulevards.

    巴黎人民示威反对法西斯暴行
    新华社9日讯　据塔斯社巴黎消息：法国一些反动集团借口匈牙利反革命暴乱的失败，对法国共产党进行法西斯袭击。
    11月7日晚间，巴黎的一群反共暴徒袭击了法国共产党中央委员会的办公处。暴徒破门而入，捣毁了许多家具和设备，并且放火烧了这座房子。“人道报”和“解放报”报馆也被暴徒捣毁。反动分子还袭击了其他一些城市的共产党组织的建筑物。在斯特拉斯堡，反动分子想捣毁“阿尔萨斯和洛林人道报”报馆，但是没有能够得逞，这个报纸编辑部全体职工奋力赶走了这些暴徒。
    法国劳动人民对这种法西斯暴行表示极大愤慨。巴黎的劳动人民7日组织了示威游行，反对这种暴行。游行者和法西斯暴徒发生了冲突，在冲突中有人受伤。
    8日上午巴黎没有出版任何报纸，因为巴黎各报纸印刷厂职工为抗议反动分子袭击“人道报”和“解放报”而宣布罢工一天。
    8日晚间，尽管警察当局禁止，巴黎劳动人民还是在巴黎最大的广场之一——共和国广场举行了劳动人民的大示威。在共和国广场和邻近的街道上聚集了成千的劳动者、爱国者、民主人士，他们决定给反动势力以有力的回击。到处可以听到这样的口号：“不准法西斯主义胡作非为！”集结在共和国广场上的大批警察企图驱散示威的队伍，结果发生了冲突。示威的人们唱着“马赛曲”和“国际歌”走过了几条大街和林荫道。
