Xinhua News Agency, November 24th: London - Serious divisions have emerged within the British Conservative Party regarding the withdrawal of troops from Egypt.

Two opposing forces within the Conservative Party are simultaneously exerting pressure on the government. A group centered around the far-right "Suez Group" members opposes a "premature" withdrawal from Egypt. They demand guarantees of "international control" over the canal and the clearing of the canal first. It is estimated that this faction includes about fifty Conservative members of parliament. They have stated that they will not support a Prime Minister who gives in to "defeatism." According to Agence France-Presse (AFP), this attitude is mainly directed at acting Prime Minister Butler.

Meanwhile, another faction within the Conservative Party agrees with the opposition Labour Party's view, advocating for an immediate withdrawal from Egypt in accordance with the United Nations resolution. AFP reports that this group has about thirty members of parliament, twenty of whom have jointly submitted a letter to the government stating their views.

November 22nd was considered by Conservative Party members as a "critical" day due to the development of internal disputes. On the evening of that day, acting Prime Minister Butler and Chancellor of the Exchequer Macmillan attended a secret meeting of backbench members of parliament, making every effort to bridge the party's divisions. According to Reuters, Macmillan gave a lengthy speech at the meeting, warning the "right-wingers" not to go "too far" and the "left-wingers" not to be "too enthusiastic" on the issue of withdrawal. In his speech, he tried hard to get the dissenting Conservatives to unanimously support the government.

Xinhua News Agency, November 24th: Paris - What will happen to the French Mollet cabinet after British Prime Minister Eden leaves office due to "illness"? This question is becoming the focus of discussion here. Political figures in Paris make no secret of the fact that the Mollet cabinet is in a more unstable position than before due to the failure of the invasion of Egypt jointly launched by Mollet and Eden.

According to reports, criticism of Mollet's policy of using force is becoming "increasingly fierce," and even sharp criticism within Mollet's own party, the Socialist Party, is increasing. An AFP report stated that in Paris, left-wing members of the Socialist Party are already trying to form an opposition to Mollet's policies, especially regarding his policies in the Middle East and Algeria.

The AFP report also pointed out that the activities of organizing an opposition within the Socialist Party are secretly supported by Mendes-France's Radical Socialists.

Mendes-France's Radical Socialist Party has thirteen members in the Mollet cabinet. According to reports, "their withdrawal from the cabinet would almost certainly trigger the twenty-third government crisis in postwar France."

Some people in Paris also pointed out that the Mollet cabinet came to power at the beginning of this year with its proclaimed Socialist Party program. In foreign affairs, it once advocated promoting cooperation between countries. However, they pointed out that since this cabinet came to power, it has brought France not more friends but "greater isolation," not social progress but increasing military expenditure, a severe shortage of fuel, a reduction in the scale of transportation and industrial production, inflation, higher taxes, and a feeling among the people that there is a lack of essential living materials. All of this makes it difficult for the Socialist Party to give a clear explanation to the people, which has become a heavy burden for it.

    英保守党对撤军问题发生分歧
    巴黎政界人士担心摩勒政府地位不稳
    据新华社24日讯　伦敦消息：英国保守党内部在从埃及撤军的问题上发生了严重的分歧。
    保守党内有两种意见不同的势力正在同时对政府施加压力。以极右翼的“苏伊士集团”分子为中心的一批人反对“过早”从埃及撤军。他们要求首先取得对运河实行“国际管制”和清理运河的保证。据估计，这一派保守党议员大约有五十多人。他们表示绝不支持一个向“失败主义”让步的首相。据法新社消息说，这种态度主要是针对代理首相巴特勒的。
    同时，保守党内的另一派人士却同意反对党工党的意见，主张按照联合国的决议立即从埃及撤军。法新社消息说，这个集团拥有约三十名议员，其中二十人已经联名上书政府陈述他们的意见。
    22日这一天被保守党人士认为是由于党内争吵的发展而情况“危急”的一天。这一天的晚上，代理首相巴特勒和财政大臣麦克米伦出席了下院后座议员的一次秘密会议，竭力设法弥补党内的分裂。据路透社报道，麦克米伦在会上作了长篇演说，警告“右翼分子”不要做得“太过分”，“左翼分子”在撤军问题上也不要“过于热心”。他在演说里竭力企图使意见不合的保守党人一致支持政府。
    据新华社24日讯　巴黎消息：英国首相艾登因“病”离职以后，法国摩勒内阁的命运怎样？这个问题正在变为此间谈论的中心。巴黎的政界人士毫不掩饰这样一点，由于摩勒和艾登合作发动的侵埃战争的失败，摩勒内阁已经处在比以前不稳定的地位。
    据消息报道，政界人士对摩勒的使用武力的政策的抨击“愈来愈激烈”了，甚至摩勒自己领导的党——社会党内部的尖锐批评也与日俱增。法新社的一条消息说，在巴黎，社会党左翼人士已经在尝试组成一支反对派来反对摩勒的政策，特别是关于他在中东和阿尔及利亚的政策。
    这一条法新社的消息还指出，社会党内部组织反对派的活动是暗中得到孟戴斯—弗朗斯的激进社会党人的支持的。
    孟戴斯—弗朗斯的激进社会党在摩勒内阁中有十三个党员。有消息说，“他们要是退出内阁，差不多一定会引起战后法国第二十三次政府危机”。
    巴黎的某些人士还指出，摩勒内阁在今年年初是以它所标榜的社会党的纲领上台的，在外交方面，它还一度鼓吹过要促进国与国之间的合作。但是，他们指出，这个内阁上台以来给法国带来的不是更多的朋友而是“更加孤立”，不是社会进步而是军费支出日益增加，燃料极度缺乏，运输和工业生产的规模缩小，通货膨胀，赋税增高，人民感到生活资料缺少等等。这一切使得社会党不能向人民交代清楚而成为它的一个沉重负担。
