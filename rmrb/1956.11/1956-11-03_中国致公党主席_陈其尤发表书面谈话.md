Xinhua News Agency, 2nd. The Central Standing Committee of the China Zhi Gong Party held an ad hoc expanded meeting this afternoon to protest the armed aggression against Egypt by British and French imperialists.

Chen Qiyou, Chairman of the China Zhi Gong Party, issued a written statement today on behalf of the Central Committee of the China Zhi Gong Party, saying:

“The Chinese people will always uphold peace and justice. Therefore, we will always resolutely stand on the side of the Egyptian people. If there is a need, our comrades of the China Zhi Gong Party must, regardless of all sacrifices, join the people of the whole country to support the Egyptian people. The Egyptian people will never be isolated in their heroic struggle to defend their sovereignty and independence. Final victory will belong to them—peace and justice will prevail over war!”

Staff and representatives of the China Zhi Gong Party also wrote letters today to Egyptian President Nasser and the Egyptian people to express their support for their just struggle. They also wrote letters to Mr. O'Neill, the British Chargé d'Affaires in China, and the British and French governments, protesting the aggressive actions of Britain and France. The protest letter stated:

“We want to warn the British and French colonialists that the era of imperialist hegemony is gone forever. Peace-loving people all over the world stand by Egypt. The Egyptian people's just struggle against aggression will surely be victorious. British and French imperialism should immediately stop this sinful activity, withdraw all armed forces threatening the Egyptian people, and promptly resolve the Suez Canal issue through peaceful negotiations in accordance with the resolutions of the United Nations Security Council. Not an inch of Egyptian territory is allowed to be violated.

The Chinese people will resolutely support the Egyptian people's just struggle to the end!"
