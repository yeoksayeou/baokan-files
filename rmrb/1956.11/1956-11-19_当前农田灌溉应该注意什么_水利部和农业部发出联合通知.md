Xinhua News Agency, 17th. It is now the season for winter farmland irrigation, and some areas such as Henan and Shaanxi provinces have already experienced drought. In order to create conditions for increasing winter wheat production and to ensure that winter fallow land can be sown in a timely manner next spring, the Ministry of Water Resources and the Ministry of Agriculture issued a joint notice on the 14th, titled "On Seizing the Opportunity to Vigorously Carry Out Winter Irrigation Work."

The notice requires that all drought-affected irrigation areas make full use of all water sources, various irrigation facilities, and water lifting tools. Based on local climate, soil, and water source conditions, winter irrigation areas should be expanded as much as possible in accordance with local conditions, and winter irrigation techniques should be improved. Water conservancy and agricultural departments at all levels must strengthen the leadership, supervision, and inspection of winter irrigation work. The management agencies of all irrigation areas and agricultural technology extension stations should list technical guidance for winter irrigation work as an important task at present. Agricultural production cooperatives in irrigation areas should also make proper arrangements and actively carry out winter irrigation work.

Regarding winter irrigation techniques, the notice emphasizes the importance of mastering the timing and amount of irrigation. For winter wheat fields, it is necessary to prevent the occurrence of frost damage to wheat seedlings caused by excessive flooding and late timing. For water storage irrigation in winter fallow land, it is also necessary to avoid excessive water volume that can cause deep seepage and raise the groundwater level. At the same time, winter irrigation work must be closely combined with agricultural cultivation techniques. According to experience, timely harrowing and rolling after irrigation, followed by spring hoeing in the coming year, plays an extremely important role in reducing soil compaction and cracks, reducing evaporation, and maintaining moisture.

    当前农田灌溉应该注意什么
    ·水利部和农业部发出联合通知·
    新华社17日讯　目前已经进入冬季农田灌溉的时期，有些地区如河南、陕西等省已经发生旱象。为了给冬小麦增产创造条件和保证冬闲地明年春季能够适时播种，水利部和农业部在14日发出了“关于抓紧时机大力开展冬灌工作”的联合通知。
    通知要求各地旱作灌区充分利用一切水源以及各种灌溉设施和提水工具，根据当地气候、土壤、水源情况，因地制宜地尽可能地扩大冬灌面积，并且把冬灌技术提高一步。各级水利、农业部门必须加强冬灌工作的领导和督促检查。所有灌区的管理机构和农业技术推广站要把冬灌工作的技术指导列为当前的一项重要工作。灌区农业生产合作社也应当妥善安排，积极做好冬灌工作。
    在冬灌技术方面，通知强调必须掌握灌溉的时间和水量。冬小麦地的灌溉，要防止大水漫灌和时间过晚发生麦苗冻坏的现象。冬闲地储水灌溉，也要避免水量过大而造成深层渗漏抬高地下水的现象。同时，冬灌工作必须和农业耕作技术密切结合。根据经验，灌水后及时耙耱磙压，来年进行春锄，对减轻土壤板结裂缝，减少蒸发，保持水分，有着极重要的作用。
