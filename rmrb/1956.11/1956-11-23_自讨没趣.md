    Asking for Trouble
    Yishan
    A friend of mine, a few months ago, at the request of the editor of a certain publication, wrote a written statement for a forum specifically for the "Hundred Flowers Campaign" held by a certain group. After it was published, he noticed that the text had been altered. That friend believed that the big topic was the "Hundred Flowers Campaign" and the smaller topic was the written statement, and he would be responsible for the content. It wouldn't implicate the editor or harm the reputation of the publication, so why the heavy editing? He then raised his concerns to the editorial department, who replied with an apology. Later, the editor of that publication again requested a contribution from that friend; when the manuscript was published, it was altered again, with seven changes in just 1,500 words.
    The title was "Critique of the Kunqu Opera 'Zhong Kui Marries His Sister.'" Original text: "Zhong Kui was stripped of his official rank due to his ugly appearance and committed suicide in indignation. The Emperor of Heaven, pitying his unjust suffering, appointed him as a deity to capture demons," "Emperor of Heaven" was changed to "Divine Spirit"; original text: "He wanted to marry his sister to Du Ping, but his sister did not immediately accept, so he became furious, revealing another subjective side: biased, and impatient," "subjective side" was changed to "subjective aspect"; original text: "Originally, if he weren't biased and impatient, he wouldn't have committed suicide. His personality is not simple," the last sentence was changed to "His personality is like this"; original text: "... at the same time charming and graceful, rough but meticulous," the four characters "charming and graceful" were deleted; original text: "The characters appearing in the play as ghosts" was changed to "The characters appearing in the script as ghosts"; original text: "Such a dance drama, the beauty of the scene is not hard to imagine," was changed to "hard to imagine"; original text: "... the technique has indeed reached its peak," was changed to "the performance techniques have indeed reached a state of perfection."
    The author asked the editorial department; the editorial department said that only one change was made, and the other six were probably made by other departments; the author could offer any opinions on whether the changes were good or bad. But that author's point was that he had raised his concerns before, and they had apologized, but it didn't help; what was the point of bringing it up again? He felt that whether the changes to the text were good or bad was a minor matter, and it wasn't as if it couldn't be changed; the main thing was that the changes were made without his consent, because the author writing for the publication was different from a secretary drafting a document for a leader.
    My feelings are different. A short article of 1,500 words being changed as many as seven times proves that, in the eyes of the editor, the author's writing skills and academic level are really not very high. As for making changes without the author's consent, it must be a very serious error, obvious at a glance. The author shouldn't have offered such text for public display in the first place. If he doesn't admit that his writing is so incoherent, then before agreeing to write the article, he should have thoroughly studied the publication's writing style to conform to the standards; otherwise, he is just asking for trouble and also causing the editor comrades extra trouble.

    自讨没趣
    迻山
    有位朋友，几个月之前应某刊物编辑之请，写了一篇在某团体专为百家争鸣召开的座谈会上的书面发言。披露后发觉文字改动了，那位朋友认为大题目是百家争鸣，小题目是书面发言，文责自负，不会连累编辑，也不会损害刊物的声誉，何劳斧削？他便向编辑部提意见，编辑部复了信，表示抱歉。后来那刊物的编辑又向那朋友约稿；稿子发表出来，又改动了，而且短短一千五百字改动了七处。
    题目是“评昆剧的‘钟馗嫁妹’”。原文：“钟馗以貌丑而科名被革，愤而自杀，上帝悯其受屈，封为捉拿邪魔的神道”，“上帝”改为“神灵”；原文：“他想把妹子嫁给杜平，妹子没有马上接受，他便暴跳起来，露出另一副主观主义的面目：偏执，急躁”，“主观主义的面目”改为“主观的面目”；原文：“本来吗，不偏执，不急躁，他不会自杀的。他性格并不单纯”，最后一句改为“他性格如此”；原文：“……同时也妩媚多姿，粗中带细”，“妩媚多姿”四字被删；原文：“剧中以鬼的面目出现的人物”，改为“剧本以鬼的面目出现的人物”；原文：“这样的一折歌舞剧，画面之美是不难想像的”，改为“难以想像的”；原文：“……技术的确已经登峰造极了”，改为“表演技巧的确是达到炉火纯青的境地了”。
    作者问编辑部；编辑部说只改动一处，其他六处恐怕是别的部门改的；作者对改好改坏若有意见，尽管提。但那作者的意思是从前提过意见，他们也道过歉，都没用；还提什么？他觉得文字改好改坏是小事，也不是不能改；主要是在于不征求本人同意而改，因为作者为刊物写稿，究竟不同于秘书代首长起草文件。
    我的感想可不同。一千五百字的短文被改动七处之多，证明在编者眼中，作者的文字修养和学术水平实在太不高明；至于不征求作者同意而改，想必是错误万分严重，一见便明之故。这样的文字，作者压根儿不该拿出去献丑。假如他不承认文理不通到这个田地，那末在应约写稿之前也应当把那个刊物的文风揣摩透彻，才能合乎规格；否则便是自讨没趣，同时也多费了编辑同志的心。
