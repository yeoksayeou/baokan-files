    Rich and Colorful National Martial Arts
    Cai Longyun
    Martial arts is a unique sports art in our country's cultural heritage. It is a traditional sport loved by the broad masses of the people in our country. It not only contains combative characteristics and artistic forms, but also has the value of exercising the body, and also has many uses in health care and medicine.
    Before liberation, martial arts was devastated and unrecognizable in the society ruled by the Kuomintang reactionaries, under the dual oppression of "complete Westernization" and "restorationism." After liberation, the Communist Party of China and the People's Government supported it based on the needs of the people. However, because many bad influences imposed on the martial arts community by the reactionary rulers of the old society have not been completely eliminated, the masses cannot smoothly participate in martial arts activities and universally develop it into a sports program. Therefore, it is of great significance to mobilize people in the martial arts community and the broad masses to jointly explore, sort out, research, and develop martial arts.
    Generally speaking, martial arts mainly consists of various barehanded boxing routines and various weapon techniques routines. According to preliminary investigations, there are more than 600 martial arts projects scattered throughout the country, including 199 boxing styles, of which 130 belong to the Shaolin boxing (commonly known as Changquan) category; there are more than 400 weapon techniques, of which about 283 use knives, spears, staffs, and swords. This shows the richness and variety of martial arts in our country.
    The most primitive form of martial arts is fighting, which is a skill for human survival. In the primitive commune period, in order to survive, humans needed not only to forage for fruits, but also to obtain meat and wear animal skins. At the same time, in order to ensure their safety, they needed to fight against fierce beasts. In this way, humans needed a set of methods for hunting wild animals and fighting with them. This method gradually developed in practice and became an indispensable fighting skill (including offense and evasion) in life, which is a survival skill. Later, fighting skills further developed. The "Book of Han, Records of Arts and Literature, Military Skills" contains thirteen schools with "Hand-to-hand Combat" in six chapters and "Swordsmanship" in thirty-eight chapters. The intention was to train soldiers, indicating that in the Han Dynasty, fighting had formed a systematic form of combat.
    The Tang Dynasty was a period of economic prosperity in Chinese history. Poets and scholars roamed the world, and the spirit of chivalry was also at its peak. Combat developed widely in this society and moved in many directions towards swordsmanship combat. The famous poet Li Bai had also studied swordsmanship combat. This spirit of chivalry was reflected in dance art in the form of "Sword Dance," which promoted the integration of combat and dance. Du Fu wrote a poem "Watching a Disciple of Lady Gongsun Dance the Sword." By the Song Dynasty, the sword dance, which expressed combat, had developed in two different directions. One went towards "dramatic art," and the other went towards "martial art." Some martial art performers absorbed materials from long and short weapons, barehanded and weapon combat techniques, and created various artistic works full of fighting spirit that expressed combat based on the creative principles of martial art. The creation of "martial art" must draw materials from various combat characteristics and combat rules, so these creators must also be figures who understand combat. In this way, "martial art" and "combat" became a unified system, and this unified system laid the foundation for today's martial arts.
    Martial arts today still includes these two basic aspects: "combat" and "martial art." Martial arts being able to take the path of sports today is inseparable from its own characteristics and the needs of the masses.
    Let's take "combat" first. "Combat" has developed into systematic projects today. In barehanded combat, there are Sanshou (Chinese kickboxing), Push Hands, Wrestling, etc. In weapon combat, there are fencing, bayonet fighting, etc. The characteristic of Sanshou is the use of both hands and feet, with extreme tension in the whole body muscles, and very rapid movements. This can make the muscles flexible and elastic. And because of the intense muscle activity, it simultaneously improves the function of the respiratory system and the cardiovascular system. On the other hand, it can also train the accuracy of strikes and cultivate people's courage, tenacity, composure, resourcefulness and other willpower qualities, as well as strength, speed, endurance, etc. The characteristic of Push Hands is the use of the body's sense of proprioception of the elbows, wrists, palms, and fingers to help determine the most subtle changes in the opponent's muscle strength, and to slip away from this force or use leverage to push the opponent away. This requires the proprioceptive sensory function and the central nervous system to improve function, and to be able to quickly transform the complex processes of inhibition and excitation. The characteristic of wrestling lies in overcoming living resistance. It can develop muscles and improve the functional ability of the heart and respiratory system. It also has important significance in developing strength and agility. Fencing and bayonet fighting can cultivate people's skills in offense and defense, and cultivate people's attention and ability to quickly identify situations. Because the situation changes constantly during fencing and bayonet fighting, people must be able to identify it in time and be able to attack. The reaction ability of the central nervous system, and the sensory and other functional senses are very sensitive. This further exercises and improves the coordination function of the nervous system and the activities of various muscles. It is precisely because of this that the people love it and use it to exercise their bodies. At present, except for fencing, bayonet fighting and Sanshou, which do not have certain protective equipment and are relatively dangerous, and have not been accepted by the broad masses, wrestling and push hands have become very common throughout the country. In this way, it naturally develops into a "sports competition."
    Let's take "martial art" again. In addition to using weapons such as knives, swords, staffs, spears, etc., it is also divided into various boxing styles in barehanded combat, and each boxing style has many "martial art" creations, some "light and elegant," some "majestic and vigorous," and some "tumbling and somersaulting." This gives it comprehensive artistic value such as music, aesthetics, and gymnastics. In each work of "martial art," the continuity between movements has the strength and pauses of urgency, slowness, lightness, heaviness, strength, weakness, large, and small, which constitutes the melody of the entire work. At the same time, in each work, it has complete, symmetrical, light, and clear composition and screen. If viewed from all the works, then the entire "martial art" contains movements of extension, flexion, rotation, balance, jumping, rolling, etc. of modern gymnastics. Therefore, it is no different from Chinese classical artistic gymnastics. Because "martial art" contains the movements that gymnastics should have, it has a certain effect on the development of people's body muscles, the flexibility of various joints, the extension and consolidation of various ligaments, and the coordination function of balance senses, nerves, and muscle activities. Most of the movements of "martial art" are performed by large muscles. Therefore, the lung capacity is higher than that of general gymnastics, which promotes the high activity of blood circulation organs and respiratory organs, which can complete the task of exercising physical fitness. The training of "martial art" requires a long and arduous process, requiring us to have the fine qualities of enduring hardship and overcoming difficulties. Because "martial art" contains the form of dance, and has a strong sense of beauty with clear melody and graceful movements, it can cultivate people's correct aesthetic views and love for art. In addition, because some boxing styles, such as Taijiquan, lack jumping, rolling, and a certain number of balance movements, its activities focus more on breathing, which plays a special role in the exercise of internal organs - a medical role. Because "martial art" is a comprehensive art, it plays a relatively complete role in sports, so people love it and regard it as a means of exercising the body, and it naturally develops into "classical artistic gymnastics."
    Judging from the exercise effects of countless martial arts practitioners, martial arts has a certain scientific value. Some projects not only have relatively complete and systematic theories in terms of guiding principles and technical training, but also have reached a relatively high level. Its requirements for physical training are also very clear. For example, Taijiquan requires the upper and lower body to follow each other, the inside and outside to be consistent, the reaction to be rapid, and the movements to be flexible, relaxed, and gentle, making it a particularly suitable exercise program for the elderly and the weak. Although Changquan has many schools, it also has many common characteristics in the more than 50 boxing styles that have been discovered. At the same time, its brave and agile graceful image attracts people to exercise. However, due to the long-term use of martial arts by the reactionary ruling class, as well as sectarian divisions, technical fragmentation and confusion, and superstitious and absurd claims have been created. Therefore, in sorting out martial arts, attention should be paid to promoting the new and eliminating the old, removing the dross and keeping the essence, collecting all items that are beneficial to the people's health and have beautiful artistic forms, researching and sorting them out, and clarifying their purpose and target based on the different nature of each project. In terms of technology, it should become a standardized, regulated, and scientific sports program.
    Because martial arts has a long history and many projects, we cannot complete its sorting task in a short period of time. At present, we can first focus on the projects that are particularly loved by the masses and are most widely developed among the masses, create experience, and gradually promote them. In the process of sorting out, we should oppose requiring martial arts in the form of gymnastics, but we cannot ignore the scientific principles of sports. Only in this way can we correctly preserve the martial arts heritage and prevent blind development.
    Although the martial arts performance competition held in Beijing this time did not have many projects, it has provided many valuable experiences and valuable materials, which has provided favorable conditions for continuing to collect, research and sort out martial arts in the future. We believe that with the joint efforts of people in the martial arts community and the broad masses who love martial arts, martial arts will become a part of our country's mass sports movement.

    丰富多采的祖国武技艺术
    蔡龙云
    武术是我国文化遗产中一项具有独特风格的体育艺术。它是我国广大人民所喜爱的传统体育运动。它不仅含有技击特点，具有艺术形式，并且具有锻炼身体的价值，在保健和医疗方面也有不少功用。
    解放前，武术运动在国民党反动派统治的社会里，在“全盘西化”和“复古主义”的双重压迫下，被搞得七零八落，面目全非。解放后，中国共产党和人民政府才根据人民的需要把它扶植起来。但是，由于旧社会反动统治者所加在武术界的许多坏的影响，还没有能够彻底清除，群众还不可能顺利地参加武术活动，并把它普遍地发展为体育运动项目。因此，动员武术界人士和广大群众共同来发掘、整理、研究和发展武术运动，是极有意义的。
    一般地说来，武术是以各种徒手拳套和各种器械的技术套路为主要内容的。根据初步的调查，散在全国各地的武术约有六百多个项目，其中拳术有一百九十九项，而属于少林拳（俗称长拳）类的有一百三十项；器械技术约有四百多项，而使用刀、枪、棍、剑四种器械的约有二百八十三项，由此可见我国武术内容的丰富多采了。
    武术的最原始的形式是格斗，是人类求生存的生活技能。在原始公社时期，人类为了生存，除了觅食果实以外，还需要肉食和穿着兽皮，同时，为了保障生命安全，需要同猛兽进行斗争。这样，人类就需要有一套猎取野兽，同野兽格斗的方法，这种方法在实践中逐渐发展，便形成了在生活中不可缺少的格斗（包括进击和躲闪）技能，也就是生存的技能。到了后来，格斗技能进一步向前发展。汉书艺文志兵伎巧十三家中有“手搏”六篇，“剑道”三十八篇，其意用在训练军士，可见在汉代格斗已经形成了一种系统的技击。
    唐代是我国历史上经济繁盛的时代。诗人骚客漫游天下，而游侠之风也盛极一时。技击在这种社会里普遍发展并且是多向剑术技击这方面发展。著名的诗人李白就曾学习过剑术技击。这种游侠风气反映在舞蹈艺术上出现了“剑器舞”，这就促使技击同舞蹈融合。杜甫曾写过“观公孙大娘弟子舞剑器行”的诗。到了宋朝，表现技击的剑器舞又分向两条不同的道路发展。一条走向了“戏剧艺术”；另一条走向了“武技艺术”。某些武技艺术表演家们根据武技艺术的创作原则，在长短兵、徒手等器械技击和徒手技击中吸取了素材，创作了各种各样的表现技击的充满战斗气魄的艺术作品。“武技艺术”的创作必须在各种技击特点和技击规律中去汲取素材，所以这些创作家们也必然是个懂得技击的人物。这样，“武技艺术”和“技击”就成了一个统一的体系，这个统一的体系就为今天的武术运动奠定了基础。
    武术运动在今天它还是包含着“技击”和“武技艺术”这两个基本方面。武术在今天能够走上体育的道路是同它本身的特点和群众的需要分不开的。
    先拿“技击”来说。“技击”在今天发展成为系统项目的，在徒手方面有散手（中国拳击）、推手、摔角等等，在器械方面的有击剑、刺枪等等；散手的特点是手足并用，全身肌肉的张力极大，而动作非常迅速，这就能够将肌肉锻炼得灵活和富有弹性；并且由于肌肉活动的剧烈，这就同时提高了呼吸系统和心脏血液循环系统的机能。另一面它又能锻炼打击的准确性和培养人们勇敢、顽强、沉着、机智等意志品质以及力量、速度、耐久力等。推手的特点是运用肘、腕、掌、指的本体感觉，来帮助判定对手肌肉力量上所发生的最细微的变化而滑避这种力量或借劲发劲地将对手推出。这就要求本体感官机能和中枢神经提高功能，能够迅速变换抑制同兴奋作用的复杂过程。摔角的特点在于克服活的阻力。它能使肌肉发达，并能提高心脏和呼吸系统的机能能力，它在发展力量和机敏等方面也有重要意义。击剑、刺枪等运动能够培养人们进攻和防守的技巧，培养人们的注意力和迅速辨认情况的能力，由于进行击剑、刺枪时，情况变化不定，人们要能及时地辨清并能进击，中枢神经系统的反应能力，和视觉、感觉等机能感受非常敏锐，这就进一步地锻炼和提高了神经系统同各部肌肉活动的协调机能。正因为这样人民群众才喜爱它，用它来锻炼身体。目前除了击剑、刺枪和散手还没有一定的防护用具，危险性较大，没有能够被广大群众所接受以外，像摔角、推手在全国各地已很普遍。这样，它就很自然地发展成为一种“体育竞技运动”。
    再拿“武技艺术”来说。它除了使用器械如刀、剑、棍、枪等以外，在徒手中还分有各种拳系，每个拳系中又各有很多“武技艺术”的创作，有的“轻快飘逸”，有的“雄伟浑厚”，有的“跌扑翻滚”。这就赋予了它以音乐、美学、体操等综合性的艺术价值。“武技艺术”的每个作品中，动作同动作之间的连续，都有着急、缓、轻、重、强、弱、大、小的劲力和顿挫，构成了整个作品的旋律。同时在每个作品中它都有着完整的、匀称的、轻盈的、明朗的构图和画面。如果从所有的作品来看，那么整个的“武技艺术”它包含着伸屈、回转、平衡、跳跃、滚翻等现代体操的动作，因此，它又无异是中国的古典艺术体操。“武技艺术”中由于包含着体操所应有的动作，所以它对人们身体各部肌肉的发育、各部关节的灵活、各韧带的伸长和巩固以及平衡感官、神经同肌肉活动的协调机能都有一定的作用。“武技艺术”的多数动作是由大肌肉来执行的。因之肺活量比一般的体操高，促使了血液循环器官和呼吸器官活动的高涨，这就能完成锻炼体质的任务。“武技艺术”的锻炼需要有较长的艰苦过程，要求我们具有吃苦耐劳、克服困难的优良品质。“武技艺术”由于它含有着舞蹈的形式，具有一种旋律鲜明、动作优美的强烈的美的感觉，可以培养人们审美的正确观点和热爱艺术的兴趣。此外，由于某些拳系，像太极拳虽然缺乏跳跃、滚翻和一定数量的平衡等动作，但它的活动多注重在呼吸，对内脏的锻炼起了特别的作用——医疗作用。“武技艺术”由于它是综合性的艺术，在体育上起着较完整的作用，所以人们喜爱它，认为是一种锻炼身体的手段，它也就很自然地发展成为“古典艺术体操”。
    从无数的武术锻炼者的锻炼效果看，武术具有一定的科学价值。有些项目在指导原理和技术训练方面不仅已经有了比较完整的、系统的理论，而且达到了比较高的水平。它对身体训练方面的要求也是非常明确的。如太极拳在身体训练方面要求上下相随，内外一致，反应迅速，动作灵敏而轻松、缓和，成为特别适宜于年老体弱的人的锻炼项目。长拳虽有许多门派，但在已发现的五十多种拳术项目中，也具备了许多共同特点。同时，它的勇敢、敏捷的优美形象，吸引人们去进行锻炼。但是，由于武术被反动统治阶级的长期利用，以及宗派分立，造成了技术上的零散混乱和迷信一些荒诞的说法，因此整理武术运动，要注意推陈出新，去粗存精，把一切有益于人民身体健康、艺术形式优美的项目收集起来，加以研究整理，依据各种项目的不同性质，明确它的使用目的、对象，在技术上使成为有标准，有规则，科学化的体育运动项目。
    由于武术运动的历史悠久，项目繁多，我们不可能在短时期内完成它的整理任务。目前，可以先抓住为群众所特别喜爱，在群众中发展得最普遍的项目进行整理，创造经验，逐步推广。在整理工作过程中，应当反对以体操的形式来要求武术，但也不能忽视体育运动的科学原则。只有这样才能正确地保存武术遗产，和防止盲目的发展。
    这次在北京举行的武术表演比赛，虽然项目不多，但已经提供了许多宝贵的经验和可贵的资料，对今后继续收集、研究整理武术提供了有利的条件。我们相信，在武术界人士和广大爱好武术的群众的共同努力下，武术运动将成为我国群众性体育运动的一部分。
