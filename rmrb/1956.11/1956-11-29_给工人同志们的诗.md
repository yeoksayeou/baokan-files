    Poems for Worker Comrades
    Li Yang
    In August and September of this year, I participated in a tour group organized jointly by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and the Chinese Writers Association, visiting major factories in Taiyuan, Luoyang, Wuhan, Nanjing, Wuxi, Suzhou, Shanghai, and Hangzhou, and touring scenic spots and historical sites. These few short poems are written in retrospect of some of the feelings during this visit.
    The Luoyang Shovel
    —To the Comrades of the Luoyang Tractor Factory
    The Luoyang area has a special kind of iron shovel. Although it is also an ordinary iron shovel, its peculiar experience is surprising. A long shovel neck is connected to a long wooden handle. People drill it into the deep layers of the earth, bringing up a clump of underground soil to identify the nature and age of the soil. In the past, it was in the hands of treacherous merchants and national traitors, who used it to excavate ancient tombs and steal countless underground cultural treasures of the country. Today, it is in the hands of the people. It is like a subterranean immortal in myths, rushing around everywhere, surveying the soil for bases, and helping the country build a great tractor factory.
    Embroidery Song
    —To the Female Workers of the Suzhou Embroidery Arts and Crafts Production Cooperative
    With your joy in labor,
    With your love for art,
    With your wise eyes and brocade hearts,
    On that soft silk, you are embroidering:
        One stitch, two stitches, three stitches…
    In the past, you embroidered the pleasure-seeking pictures of landlords;
    In the past, you embroidered the profits of capitalists;
    In the past, you embroidered your own bitterness,
    Your strings of dreams of hunger and cold:
        One stitch, two stitches, three stitches…
    The Communist Party cut off your tangled threads of suffering,
    And even the 70-year-old worker regained her youth.
    Embroider! Embroider! Embroider blooming flowers;
    Embroider your happy hearts like flowers:
        One stitch, two stitches, three stitches…
    Embroider your warm and bright Jiangnan—
    That emerald lake and mountain, golden paddy field;
    Embroider our beloved and great Mao Zedong;
    Embroider the glorious and splendid morning of the motherland:
    To a Nineteen-Year-Old Fine Yarn Girl Worker
    Your smiling eyes are full of intelligence and wit,
    Your thoughts are finer than 80-count fine yarn;
    Your hands are so delicate and clever,
    One person has to manage nine hundred spinning
    bobbins whirling around.
    Without exploitation, there is no suffering,
    You seem to have completely forgotten your tearful and inspiring childhood.
    Young shoulders lightly carry the burden of life:
    Two young younger brothers, a loving mother.
    Your laughter is like the wind chimes ringing under the eaves;
    Your conversation is like a small stream rising in spring;
    Your heart is as transparent as the autumn pool.
    Flowers of happiness bloom on your youthful face,
    They exude the pride of an advancing class;
    They exude the fragrance of this great era.

    给工人同志们的诗
    力扬
    今年8、9月间，我参加了中华全国总工会和中国作家协会共同组织的旅行参观团，访问了太原、洛阳、武汉、南京、无锡、苏州、上海和杭州等地的主要工厂，并游览了名胜古迹。这几首小诗，系追写这次参观访问中的一些感受。
    给太原第一发电厂同志们太原的秋天有片片的白云，白云停留在高高的双塔上；太原的地上有无数的工厂，工厂的烟囱高耸在白云上。你们把热和光送给了居民；你们把电力送给钢铁工厂——把社会主义送给古老的太原，沉默的汾河响起欢腾的歌唱。
    洛阳铲
    ——给洛阳拖拉机制造厂的同志们洛阳地方有一种特别的铁铲，虽说也是一种普通铁打的铲子，但它奇异的遭遇却令人惊讶。长长的铲颈接上长长的木柄，人们把它钻入深深的地层，带上了一撮地下的泥土，就辨认出土壤的性质和年龄。过去它掌握在奸商、国贼的手上，他们利用它去发掘古代的坟墓，盗窃了国家无数的地下文化宝藏。今天，它掌握在人民的手上，它就像神话中的地行仙一样，到处奔忙，到处勘察基地的土壤，帮助国家建立起伟大的拖拉机厂。
    刺绣歌
    ——给苏州刺绣工艺美术生产合作社的女工同志们凭着你们对于劳动的喜悦，凭着你们对于艺术的热爱，凭着你们智慧的眼和锦绣的心，在那柔和的绸缎上，你们在绣：
  一针，二针，三针……往日绣的是地主们的行乐图；往日绣的是资本家们的利润；往日绣的是你们自己的酸辛，是你们一串串饥寒交迫的梦：
  一针，二针，三针……共产党把你们苦难的乱丝剪断，七十岁的老工人也恢复了青春。绣呀！绣呀！绣出鲜花朵朵；绣出鲜花似的你们幸福的心：
  一针，二针，三针……绣出你们温暖、明媚的江南——那翠玉的湖山，黄金的稻田；绣出我们亲爱伟大的毛泽东；绣出光辉灿烂的祖国的早晨：
    给一个十九岁的细纱女工同志微笑着的眸子充满着聪明和机智，你底心思比八十支的细纱还要细；你底双手是那样的纤巧，而又机灵，一个人要管住九百只飞旋着的
  锭子。没有了剥削，也就没有了苦难，你好像完全忘却可歌可泣的童年。年轻的双肩轻轻地挑起生活的
  担子：两个幼少的弟弟，一个慈爱的妈妈。你底笑声像檐下振响着的风铃；你底谈话像春天涨了水的小溪；你底心灵是秋天潭水似的透明。幸福的花朵盛开在你青春的脸上，它们喷散着一个前进阶级的自豪；它们喷散着这个伟大时代的芬香。
