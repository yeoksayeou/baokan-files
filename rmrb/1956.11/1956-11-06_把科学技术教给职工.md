The National Conference of Activists in Popularizing Science and Technology Among Workers has concluded. This conference will play an active and far-reaching role in promoting the in-depth and widespread development of popular science and technology work in our country, mobilizing workers across the country to march towards science, improving workers' scientific, technological, and cultural levels, thereby increasing productivity, and ensuring the completion of the Five-Year Plan.

Our country's work in popularizing science and technology has made great achievements in recent years. However, due to the rapid development of our socialist construction, the popularization of science and technology among workers is far from meeting the needs. The organization of the National Association for the Popularization of Science and Technology is not yet widespread, and many industrial and mining enterprises have not seriously done a good job in popularizing science and technology. Some departments put production in opposition to the popularization of science and technology, or believe that the popularization of science and technology cannot solve major problems in production, "it's distant water that can't quench immediate thirst." In the work of popularizing science and technology, there are also dogmatic and subjectivist tendencies that need to be improved.

The purpose of doing a good job in popularizing science and technology among workers is to teach modern science and technology to the broad masses of workers, so that they can generally understand how to master science and technology. This requires earnestly implementing the principle of combining production and reality, and implementing the principles of being small, diverse, easy to understand, lively, rich and colorful, and attracting mass participation on a voluntary basis.

Comrade Liu Shaoqi said at the Eighth National Congress of the Party that the central task of our Party and the people of the whole country is to strive to overfulfill the first Five-Year Plan and actively prepare for the second Five-Year Plan. Therefore, the current work of popularizing science and technology among workers should be closely centered on this task. In our country's industrial construction, there are many problems to be solved. And these problems cannot be completely solved by relying on a few experts and engineers. Science popularization workers must give full play to their role, actively cooperate with current tasks, strive for support and assistance from all parties, and carry out science popularization work in a planned and organized manner.

Science popularization workers must have a firm mass viewpoint and care about the lives of the masses. It is a one-sided understanding of the popularization of science and technology to only pay attention to the promotion of production technology and advanced experience, and not pay attention to the promotion of materialism, natural science, hygiene knowledge, and the scientific principles in daily life.

Some people only want to do scientific improvement work, but are unwilling to do science popularization work. This is because they do not understand the dialectical relationship between scientific improvement and science popularization. It is well known that we can only improve on the basis of science popularization. Ignoring the work of science popularization is obviously an idea that is divorced from reality and divorced from the masses.

The work of popularizing science and technology is an extremely arduous mass undertaking. Science popularization workers must rely closely on the masses, actively expand their ranks, rapidly develop science popularization organizations, discover and cultivate more activists in science popularization work, and give play to their role. Activists in science popularization work must be good at playing their leading role, bridging role, and backbone role, uniting the broad masses of scientists, engineers, skilled workers with scientific and technological literacy, and intellectuals with certain scientific and technological knowledge around them, giving full play to their strengths, and doing a good job in science popularization.

Doing a good job in science popularization also depends on the efforts of the broad masses of workers themselves. In order to meet the learning requirements of the broad masses of workers, various learning forms should continue to be used. For example, using the time of shift handover to explain the situation, discover problems, and conduct explanations; opening up red corners in the workshop, combining production, and studying technology; organizing self-study groups, using spare time, and inviting engineers to explain and tutor; combining technical classes and advanced producer movements, signing apprenticeship contracts and mutual teaching and learning contracts; organizing mutual aid nurseries to solve the learning difficulties of female workers. These methods can be widely adopted.

Learning science and technology is, after all, an arduous task. It cannot be learned well without persistent and hard work. The broad masses of workers should realize that mastering science and technology is not only a requirement of the workers themselves, but also a requirement of the country for them. They should give full play to the working class's spirit of hard work, tenacity, and fearlessness of difficulties to master science and technology.

We are building a great socialist country. Scientists, engineers, and all people with scientific and technological knowledge across the country must actively and proactively participate in science popularization work, closely combine teaching and research with science popularization work, rationally arrange their time, pay attention to the problems existing in current production and the lives of the masses, write lectures after careful consideration, explain to workers in simple terms, teach their scientific and technological knowledge to the broad masses of workers, and at the same time humbly learn from the masses of workers and summarize the experience of the masses in production. Scientists participating in science popularization work is not only beneficial to the country and the working class, but also enriches the work and life of the scientists themselves, and improves their scientific research level in solving problems in production practice.

Through the work of popularizing science and technology, the connection between intellectuals and workers and peasants can be further strengthened. Everyone should respect each other, learn from each other, work diligently and thriftily, struggle hard, and jointly promote the socialist cause forward.

### 把科学技术教给职工

    把科学技术教给职工
    全国第一次职工科学技术普及工作积极分子大会已经闭幕了。这个会议，对我国今后深入广泛地开展科学技术普及工作，动员全国职工向科学进军，提高职工科学技术和文化水平，从而提高生产率，保证五年计划的完成，将起积极的深远的作用。
    我国科学技术普及工作几年来有很大成绩。但是由于我国社会主义建设事业发展很快，职工科学技术普及工作还远远不能满足需要。全国科学技术普及工作协会的组织还不普遍，许多工矿企业还没有认真做好科学技术普及工作。有的部门把生产同科学技术普及工作对立起来，或者认为科学技术普及工作不能解决生产中的重大问题，“是远水不解近渴”。在科学技术普及工作中，也还有教条主义和主观主义的偏向需要加以改进。
    做好职工科学技术普及工作的目的就是要把现代的科学技术教给广大职工群众，让他们普遍懂得怎样掌握科学技术。这就必须切实贯彻结合生产、结合实际的方针，贯彻小型多样、通俗易懂、生动活泼、丰富多采、吸引群众自愿参加的原则。
    刘少奇同志在党的第八次全国代表大会上说过，我们党和全国人民当前的中心任务，就是争取超额完成第一个五年计划和积极准备第二个五年计划。因此，当前职工科学技术普及工作，应该紧紧地围绕着这个任务来进行。在我国工业建设中，有不少问题正待解决。而这些问题又都不是依靠少数专家和工程技术人员能够完全解决的。科学普及工作者必须充分发挥自己的作用，主动配合当前任务，争取各方面的支持和帮助，有计划有组织地开展科学技术普及工作。
    科学技术普及工作者要有坚强的群众观点，关心群众生活。那种只注意宣传生产技术和推广先进经验，而不注意唯物主义、自然科学、卫生常识以及日常生活中的科学道理的宣传，是对科学技术普及工作片面的认识。
    有些人只愿做科学提高的工作，而不愿做科学普及工作，这是因为他们不了解科学提高和科学普及之间的辩证关系。殊不知我们只能在科学普及的基础上提高。忽视科学普及工作，显然是一种脱离实际、脱离群众的思想。
    科学技术普及工作是极其繁重的群众性的事业。科学技术普及的工作者，必须紧紧地依靠群众，积极扩大自己的队伍，迅速发展科学技术普及组织，更多地发现和培养科学技术普及工作的积极分子，发挥他们的作用。科学技术普及工作中的积极分子，要善于发挥自己的带头作用、桥梁作用、骨干作用，把广大科学家、工程技术人员、有科学技术修养的熟练职工和有一定科学技术知识的知识分子，团结在自己的周围，充分发挥他们的特长，把科学技术普及工作做好。
    做好科学技术普及工作，还有赖于广大职工群众自身的努力。为了满足广大职工的学习要求，应该继续运用多种多样的学习形式。如利用交接班的时间，交待情况，发现问题，进行讲解；开辟车间红角，结合生产，研究技术；组织自学小组，利用空隙时间，请工程技术人员进行讲解和辅导；结合技术课和先进生产者运动，签订师徒合同、互教互学合同；组织互助托儿所，解决女工的学习困难。这些办法都可以广泛采用。
    学习科学技术毕竟是一件艰苦的事情，不经过持久和艰苦的努力，是不能够学好的。广大职工应该认识，掌握科学技术，不仅是职工本身的要求，也是国家对他们的要求，应该充分发挥工人阶级艰苦顽强、不怕困难的精神，去掌握科学技术。
    我们正在建设一个伟大的社会主义国家。全国的科学家、工程技术人员同一切具有科学技术知识的人们，都要积极主动地参加科学技术普及工作，把教学、研究同科学技术普及工作密切结合起来，合理地安排自己的时间，关心当前生产和群众生活中存在的问题，深思熟虑地写出讲稿，深入浅出地向职工讲解，把自己的科学技术知识教给广大的职工，同时虚心地向职工群众学习，总结群众生产中的经验。科学家参加科学技术普及工作，不仅对国家和工人阶级有利，而且也丰富了科学家本身的工作和生活，在解决生产实践的问题中，把自己科学研究的水平也提高起来。
    通过科学技术普及工作，可以进一步密切知识分子同工、农群众的联系。大家要互相尊重，互相学习，克勤克俭，艰苦奋斗，共同把社会主义事业推向前进。
