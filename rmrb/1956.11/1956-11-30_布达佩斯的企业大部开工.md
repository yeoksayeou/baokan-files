Xinhua News Agency, Prague, November 29th -- According to a report by the Czechoslovak News Agency: Most of the enterprises in Budapest resumed operations on November 27th, and the number of returning workers has also increased. Transportation to major industrial centers has also improved, with hundreds of trucks driving to important concentration points at intersections to transport workers to factories. In the factories, most of the workers have already taken on production tasks, and some workers are doing maintenance work and repairing residences.

　　Workers at the Old Buda Shipyard have decided to build a 1,100-ton tugboat and a 100-ton floating crane in the short term. Like other enterprises, workers at this factory are using various generators to generate electricity to supplement the shortage of power supply. One of Hungary's largest textile factories, the Gaerborg Textile Factory, had five printing machines in operation that day. Their power is supplied by the factory's power generation equipment.

　　Production has resumed in all mines in Hungary. Compared with the previous day, the number of miners returning to work increased by 2,000 on this day, and some mines have implemented two shifts. News from Nabanja, Borsod, and Nograd said that the miners mined nearly 600 freight cars of coal on the 26th.

    布达佩斯的企业大部开工
    新华社布拉格29日电　据捷克斯洛伐克通讯社报道：布达佩斯的企业在11月27日大部都开工了，复工的工人也有了增加。通向主要工业中心的运输工作也有了改善，数以百计的卡车开到十字路口上重要的集中地点，把工人接运到工厂去。在工厂中，大多数工人已经担负起生产任务，有一部分工人在作保养工作和修复住宅。
    老布达的造船厂的工人决定在短期内建成一艘一千一百吨的拖船和总共一百吨的水上起重机。这个厂也像其他的企业一样，工人们利用各种发电机来发电，以补电力供应的不足。匈牙利最大的纺织厂之一——高尔堡纺织厂在这一天已经有五架印花机在运转。它们的动力是靠工厂的发电设备来供应的。
    在匈牙利的一切矿场中，这一天已经恢复生产。同上一天比较起来，这天复工的矿工人数增加了两千人，有些矿场已经实行了两班制。来自纳巴尼亚、包尔绍德和诺格拉德的消息说，矿工们在26日开采了将近六百车皮的煤。
