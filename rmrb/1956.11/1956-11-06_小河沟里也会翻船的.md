Even Small Ditches Can Capsize Boats
    Hao Jie
    Civilian buildings such as office buildings and dormitories have simpler structures and construction operations than factory structures, making it easier to ensure project quality. However, quality accidents are constantly occurring in these projects.
    The Fengfeng City Construction Company in Hebei Province built one hundred and nine tile-roofed houses for the Fengfeng City People's Committee. During the rainy season this year, all of these tile-roofed houses leaked. The offices turned into reservoirs, making it impossible to work. The dormitories leaked even more severely. In the middle of the night, when the heavy rain came, people had to sit up until dawn with umbrellas and quilts.
    The Beijing Coal Washing Plant Construction and Installation Engineering Company built a batch of dormitories for the Beijing Coal Research Institute, placing the conduit and water pipes too close together. The faucets and water pipes became electrified, sometimes even the water was electrified, making the residents afraid to use the water there.
    Such examples can be found almost everywhere.
    Why is the quality of these civil buildings so poor?
    The main reason is that the construction units undertaking these houses have an incorrect idea. They believe that civil buildings are just dealing with bricks, tiles, wood, and stone, and they can "do it with their eyes closed." This sentiment is especially strong in some units that have worked on important projects. They say, "We've crossed great rivers and seas, how can we capsize in a small ditch?" The Engineering Corporation directly under the Ministry of Construction Engineering, which had built the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, thought when building a batch of simple dormitories some time ago: "What kind of technology is needed to build a bungalow? Just hand it over to the work section to handle." As a result, after the houses were built, 90% of them collapsed in a heavy rain.
    Civil buildings are most closely related to people's lives, and the state spends hundreds of millions of yuan on this every year. We hope that the construction units responsible for civil building tasks will never forget: even the slightest negligence, carelessness, or complacency will affect people's lives and cause significant losses to the country. We must learn the ability to sail smoothly in great rivers and seas, but also maintain the humble and cautious style of not capsizing even in small ditches.

    小河沟里也会翻船的
    郝洁
    办公楼、宿舍等民用建筑，结构和施工操作比起厂房结构要简单些，容易保证工程质量。但是，目前恰恰在这些工程上不断发生质量事故。
    河北省峰峰市建筑公司为峰峰市人民委员会建造了一百零九间瓦房。今年雨季，这些瓦房全都漏了，办公室变成了蓄水池，根本无法办公。宿舍漏得更厉害，深夜里暴雨来了，人们只好打着伞、披着被子坐到天明。
    北京煤炭洗煤厂建筑安装工程公司为北京煤矿研究所盖一批宿舍，把电线管子和上下水道安得太近了，水龙头、水管子都带电，有时甚至水里也带电，弄得住户都不敢用那里的水。
    这样的例子几乎各个地方都可以找到。
    为什么这些民用建筑的质量这样坏呢？
    主要的是因为承建这些房屋的建筑单位有一种不正确的思想。他们认为，民用建筑不过是同砖、瓦、木、石打交道，“闭着眼睛也可以干”。特别是一些曾经搞过重要工程的单位，这种情绪更严重。他们说：“大江大河都走过来了，小河小沟里还能翻了船？”曾经建造过第一汽车制造厂的建筑工程部直属工程公司，前些时建造一批简易宿舍的时候，就认为：“盖个平房有啥技术，交给工段去搞就行了。”结果房子盖好了，一场大雨就淋倒了90％。
    民用建筑同人民生活的关系是最密切的，国家每年要在这方面花成亿元的钱。我们希望担负着民用建筑任务的建筑单位，时时刻刻都不要忘记：哪怕是小小的一点疏忽、轻率、自满，都会影响人民生活和给国家造成重大的损失。我们要学会在大江大河里顺利行驶的本领，但是也要保持在小河小沟里也不会翻船的谦虚谨慎作风。
