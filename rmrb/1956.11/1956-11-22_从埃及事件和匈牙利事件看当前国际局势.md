Looking at the Current International Situation from the Egyptian and Hungarian Events
    Gu Si

    I. A Countercurrent

    Just as the international situation was tending towards relaxation, Britain, France, and Israel launched an armed invasion of Egypt, and counter-revolutionaries in Hungary, incited and supported by imperialism, launched an armed rebellion, attempting to subvert Hungary's people's democratic system. These two events in the Middle East and Eastern Europe formed a countercurrent, making the tending-towards-relaxation international situation tense again.

    It is not surprising that a tense situation appears in the process of international relaxation. There have been such situations in the past, and there may be such situations in the future. Because the relaxation of the international situation is not a spontaneous process, but can only be the result of repeated and acute struggles between the forces of peace and the forces of war. Imperialists have never liked the relaxation of the international situation; they rely on creating tension to survive. They will inevitably counterattack the forces of peace and try every means to weaken the forces of peace and strengthen the forces of war. If they fail once, they will carry out a second, a third... until a situation of lasting world peace appears.

    The Egyptian and Hungarian events were precisely a planned major counterattack by the imperialist war forces against the two most important aspects constituting the world's peace forces. These two aspects are: the socialist camp, which is the decisive factor in maintaining world peace; and the increasingly developing anti-colonialist movement, which is shaking the foundation of imperialism's survival.

                  II. The Counterattack Failed

    However, the world's peace forces are far stronger than the war forces, and imperialism's counterattack has not succeeded on either front.

    Imperialists used the legitimate dissatisfaction of the Hungarian people with the shortcomings and mistakes in the past work of the Hungarian government and party to incite counter-revolutionaries to launch an armed rebellion. Their purpose was not only to overthrow Hungary's people's democratic system and restore the capitalist system. They wanted to insert a counter-revolutionary wedge in Eastern Europe as a base for them to further subvert and destroy other Eastern European people's democratic countries. They attempted to weaken the strength and unity of the socialist countries in this way to prepare for launching a large-scale war of aggression.

    But the imperialists' sinister conspiracy failed. The Hungarian people, with the help of Soviet troops at their request, suppressed the armed rebellion of the counter-revolutionaries and shattered their attempt to carry out a counter-revolutionary restoration in Hungary. The imperialists are now wailing and screaming like bereaved parents and have launched an anti-Soviet, anti-communist movement on a global scale, attempting to incite tension, strike at the prestige of the socialist countries, and spread confusion among progressive and peace-loving people. As the truth about the Hungarian event becomes clearer and as the world's progressive forces more firmly counterattack this kind of conspiracy, the imperialists' plan is also destined to fail.

    The Egyptian event is an intense struggle between colonialism and anti-colonialism. The British and French imperialists colluded with Israel to launch an armed invasion of Egypt. Their purpose was not only to seize the Suez Canal, but also to overthrow the Egyptian government and expand their aggression against North Africa and the Middle East. They attempted to restore and consolidate their colonial rule in the Asia-Africa region by suppressing the Egyptian people's struggle to safeguard their sovereignty and independence, and to save the demise of the world colonial system.

    However, the British and French imperialists underestimated the strength of the Egyptian people and also underestimated the world's forces against colonialism and in defense of peace. The invaders encountered resolute resistance from the Egyptian people. With the shattering of the hope for a quick victory, the imperialists faced insurmountable difficulties. The Arab countries unanimously supported Egypt, and their strong unity rendered the imperialists' tactics of sowing discord and defeating them one by one useless. The angry condemnation of the aggressors by the people of Asia and Africa and the world's peace-loving people, and their resolute support for the Egyptian people, completely isolated the aggressors politically and morally and faced them with unpredictable and serious consequences. The Soviet Union's stern warning to Britain, France, and Israel gave the unscrupulous aggressors a head-on blow, forcing them to think calmly. Under the pressure of the Egyptian people and the world's peace forces, the invaders were forced to agree to a ceasefire after occupying Port Said.

    The imperialists originally thought that if they could succeed in Hungary, they could further create tension in Eastern Europe, contain and weaken the strength of the world peace movement's main force—the socialist countries. They originally thought that if they could succeed in Egypt, they could shrink and shatter the peace zone, put strong pressure on countries advocating peace and neutrality, and force them to follow war policies. They originally thought that this would undermine the world's peace movement and allow the war forces to gain the upper hand. However, facts have proved that their plan has also failed.

                III. Peace Forces are Greater Than War Forces

    The Egyptian and Hungarian events have proved the fact that within the world, peace forces are greater than war forces. Now, the struggle is far from over, and the situation is still very tense. However, it can already be seen that the balance of power between the peace forces and the war forces is still continuing to develop in a direction favorable to peace.

    First of all, the smashing of the Hungarian counter-revolutionaries' restoration conspiracy has ensured the security of the Eastern European people's democratic countries and the entire socialist camp, and reduced the danger of a war of aggression in Europe. The Hungarian event has made the people of the socialist countries see more clearly the brutal faces and conspiratorial means of the imperialists and counter-revolutionaries, and understand more clearly the necessity of closely uniting with the Soviet Union and other socialist countries. The political enthusiasm and political vigilance of the people of the socialist countries will be greatly enhanced. The consolidation within the socialist countries and the strengthening of mutual relations are the source of the socialist countries' great strength and a powerful guarantee for maintaining world peace.

    In the Egyptian people's struggle against aggression, the socialist countries, led by the Soviet Union, gave the Egyptian people resolute support, encouraging the world's anti-colonialist struggle. The prestige of the socialist countries has grown even more than before. The people of all countries striving for independence have realized more clearly that the socialist countries, led by the Soviet Union, are their most trustworthy friends. The Soviet Union's serious warning to the British and French aggressors played a decisive role in forcing Britain and France to agree to a ceasefire. This fully demonstrated the power of the socialist countries and their morally strong position.

    After the Egyptian event, the world's anti-colonialist forces have become even stronger. The British and French savage aggression against Egypt has aroused a common feeling of hatred among the people around the world who oppose colonialism and strive for independence. Some Arab countries have already announced the severance of diplomatic relations with Britain and France. The people of the Arab countries and the people of Asia and Africa have united as never before in the face of imperialist aggression. They support the Egyptian people and strike at the aggressors in various ways. This is a great demonstration of the anti-colonialist forces, showing the infinite potential of this force. The people of the colonies have seen their future in the brilliant example of the Egyptian people resisting the aggressors, and will struggle with even more confidence to strive for national independence and safeguard national sovereignty. However, the British and French imperialists have weakened their influence and strength in this struggle, exposed their decadence and old age, and brought serious political and economic difficulties upon themselves, which has accelerated their decline.

    The world's peace forces are continuing to develop. At the United Nations General Assembly, almost all countries demanded that Britain, France, and Israel immediately stop their aggression and withdraw their troops from Egypt. This was a powerful manifestation of the world's peace forces. The world's peace-loving people have seen specifically from the Egyptian event the madness and adventurism of the imperialist war forces, which has greatly increased their vigilance. Countries advocating peace and neutrality and the people in these countries have also seen from the Egyptian event the danger of following the imperialist war policies. They are absolutely unwilling to be dragged into an undeclared war and bring destructive disasters upon themselves.

                IV. Imperialism Has Many Difficulties

    In contrast to the further strengthening of the peace forces, the imperialist war forces are now encountering enormous difficulties, and the contradictions within them are further developing.

    The power and influence of British and French imperialism in the Middle East have now been further lost. Due to the aggression against Egypt, Britain and France themselves have blockaded the Suez Canal and caused the destruction of Middle Eastern oil pipelines. The increase in freight rates and the resulting decrease in exports, the interruption of Middle Eastern oil sources, and the huge expenses of the war of aggression against Egypt have made the already very difficult economies of Britain and France face an even more dangerous situation. The British "News Chronicle" published an editorial on November 6 attacking Britain's aggression against Egypt as a "thoroughly clumsy" policy. It worriedly said that due to this policy, "another crushing burden has been added to our country's already excessive economic burden." This situation has aroused great anger among the people of Britain and France.

    The British and French act of aggression against Egypt not only harmed their own interests, but also harmed the interests of other European countries. These countries are now also encountering great difficulties in trade, shipping, and oil sources. This has created serious contradictions between Britain and France and other European countries, and the divisions within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization will become even greater.

    The British and French acts of aggression have also deepened the crisis of the Baghdad Pact and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. Asian countries participating in these groups are in a very awkward position because they are with the aggressors. At the same time, they have also realized from the Egyptian event what the purpose of the imperialists in organizing these groups is. The Baghdad Pact recently held a meeting without Britain's participation. Public opinion in Thailand and Pakistan is also increasingly dissatisfied with their countries' participation in this kind of aggressive military group.

    The contradictions between the United States and Britain and France are becoming more acute. Of course, like Britain and France, the United States harbors colonialist aims towards Egypt and wants to make the Arab countries a base for launching wars of aggression. The United States also absolutely does not want the Egyptian anti-aggression struggle to truly win. However, the United States pretended to be a good person in the Egyptian event, demanding that Britain, France, and Israel cease fire and withdraw their troops. This is because the United States saw that Britain and France had lost their position in the Middle East due to their armed aggression against Egypt, and believed that this was an excellent opportunity to expand its own aggressive forces in the Middle East. The United States, through Canada, proposed a plan to organize a United Nations emergency force, attempting to use the United Nations emergency force to replace the British and French invading troops, achieve control over the Suez Canal, and then control Egypt and the Middle East.

    At the same time, the United States is taking advantage of Britain and France's current economic difficulties to force Britain and France to rely further on the United States by exporting large amounts of oil to Britain, France, and Western Europe. The United States' oil monopoly capital and oil tanker manufacturing industry want to take this opportunity to make a fortune. Britain and France's dependence on the dollar will be further strengthened. Therefore, although Britain and France are eager to resolve the Suez Canal issue, the United States is not in a hurry, but wants to make the resolution of the canal issue more beneficial to the United States.

    The complete political and moral bankruptcy of British and French imperialism, the serious difficulties brought upon themselves by their acts of aggression, the serious crisis currently facing the aggressive military groups, the growth of differences and contradictions between the United States and Britain and France, etc., all show that the imperialist war forces are in an increasingly unfavorable position in the face of the powerful peace forces.

        V. Resolutely Struggle to Safeguard World Peace

    However, it will still take an extremely arduous struggle to ease the current tense situation. The imperialists will never voluntarily lay down their butcher knives. They fully know that if their sinister attempt is defeated this time, the consequences and impact on them will be extremely serious.

    Therefore, the imperialists are struggling to maintain and continue to create a tense situation. On the Hungarian issue, they are widely inciting an anti-Soviet, anti-communist atmosphere around the world, and are attempting to use the United Nations to interfere in Hungary's internal affairs, creating a precedent for future interference in the internal affairs of other countries. They are attempting to use the outcry over the Hungarian event to cover up their shameful behavior in the Egyptian event, and to cover up their sinister aims of continuing aggression in Egypt and the Middle East.

    The British, French, and Israeli aggressors are still refusing to comply with the resolutions of the United Nations General Assembly, and are not only unwilling to unconditionally withdraw their invading troops from Egypt, but are also increasing their troops there. They are trying every means to keep their military forces in Egypt in order to control the Suez Canal, and to expand their aggression at any time if this goal is not achieved. They are also trying their best to undermine the unity between the Arab countries, and to sow discord between the Soviet Union, China, and the Asian-African countries that support the Egyptian people and Egypt. They are attempting to isolate Egypt in this way in order to force Egypt to accept their unreasonable demands that infringe upon Egyptian sovereignty on the issue of the United Nations forces and the Suez Canal, so as to achieve the goals that they have not been able to achieve through military aggression.

    Although the United States has acute conflicts of interest with Britain and France, it recognizes that the complete failure of the British and French aggressors is extremely detrimental to the entire imperialist camp and the colonial system. Therefore, the United States is now supporting the unreasonable attitude of Britain and France. It is now not mentioning the demand that Britain and France immediately withdraw their invading troops, and is putting pressure on Egypt, attempting to make Egypt agree that the United Nations forces enjoy powers exceeding those stipulated in the resolutions of the United Nations General Assembly, in order to lay the foundation for international control of the Suez Canal. The United States does not express opposition to Britain, France, and Israel refusing to withdraw their troops and increasing their invading troops, but opposes countries that maintain peace and uphold justice sending volunteers to Egypt to support the Egyptian people together with Britain and France. This is actually conniving at and supporting Britain and France's plan to expand their aggression.

    At the same time, the United States is actively using this opportunity to create a tense situation. The United States has ordered its naval and air forces in the Pacific and Atlantic to enter a so-called "state of alert," and is transferring its naval and air forces to the eastern Atlantic and the western Pacific. The United States is attempting to intimidate the countries and people supporting Egypt in this way, forcing them to abandon their support for Egypt in the face of the United States' war threats. On the other hand, this action by the United States is also to maintain the various military aggression groups and prevent their further disintegration and centrifugal tendencies.

    It can be seen from this that the imperialist war forces are not resigned to defeat and still want to stage a comeback. The current tense situation has not eased, and the threat to peace still seriously exists. Continuing to struggle to stop the imperialists' war conspiracies and to ease international tensions is still a serious task facing the world's peace-loving people.

    Therefore, our people must vigorously support the Hungarian people, consolidate the victory they have achieved in the struggle against the counter-revolutionaries, and resolutely oppose the Western imperialists' conspiracy to use the United Nations as a guise to illegally interfere in Hungary's internal affairs. Our people must support the Egyptian people with all their strength, support their struggle to resist aggression and safeguard sovereignty and independence, demand that the British, French, and Israeli invading troops immediately and unconditionally withdraw from Egypt, oppose the United Nations emergency force having any powers that infringe upon Egyptian sovereignty, and oppose the attempt to confuse the British, French, and Israeli aggression against Egypt with the Suez Canal issue. As long as the world's peace-loving people unite and unswervingly struggle against the war forces, then the international tense situation may turn towards relaxation, the serious war threat may be eliminated, and a situation of lasting world peace may finally appear.

### 从埃及事件和匈牙利事件看当前国际局势
顾思

专栏：国际时事述评

    从埃及事件和匈牙利事件看当前国际局势
    顾思
    一、一股逆流
    正当国际局势趋向缓和的时候，英、法、以色列发动了对埃及的武装侵略，匈牙利的反革命分子在帝国主义策动和支持下发动了武装叛乱，企图颠覆匈牙利的人民民主制度。在中东和东欧发生的这两个事件，形成了一股逆流，使得趋向缓和的国际局势又紧张起来。
    在国际局势和缓的过程中出现紧张的局面，这是毫不奇怪的事情。过去有过这种情形，将来也还可能要有这种情形。因为国际局势的缓和并不是一个自发的过程，而只能是和平力量同战争势力进行反复的和尖锐的斗争的结果。帝国主义者从来都不喜欢国际局势和缓，它们是靠搞紧张吃饭的。它们必然要向和平力量反扑，要想尽一切办法来削弱和平力量，增强战争势力。一次不成，它们还要搞第二次、第三次……一直到世界持久和平的局面出现为止。
    埃及事件和匈牙利事件，正是帝国主义战争势力向和平力量进行的一次有计划的大反扑。这次反扑是针对着构成世界和平力量的两个最主要的方面的。这两个方面就是：作为维护世界和平的决定性因素的社会主义阵营；动摇着帝国主义生存基础的日益发展的反殖民主义运动。
                  二、反扑没有成功
    但是，世界和平力量远比战争势力强大，帝国主义的这次反扑在两条战线上都没有成功。
    帝国主义者利用匈牙利人民对匈牙利政府和党过去工作中的缺点和错误的正当不满，策动反革命分子发动武装叛乱，其目的不仅仅在于推翻匈牙利的人民民主制度，复辟资本主义制度。它们是想在东欧插进一个反革命的楔子，作为它们进一步颠覆和破坏其他东欧人民民主国家的基地。它们企图这样来削弱社会主义国家的力量和团结，给发动大规模的侵略战争作好准备。
    但是帝国主义的罪恶阴谋失败了。匈牙利人民在请求苏联军队的帮助下，镇压了反革命分子的武装叛乱，粉碎了他们在匈牙利实行反革命复辟的企图。帝国主义者现在如丧考妣地大叫大嚷，并且在世界范围内发动了一个反苏、反共的运动，企图这样来煽动紧张局势，打击社会主义国家的威信，在进步和和平人士中间散布混乱。随着匈牙利事件的真相越来越清楚，随着世界进步势力对这种阴谋活动愈来愈坚强的反击，帝国主义者的这种打算也是注定要落空的。
    埃及事件是殖民主义和反殖民主义的一场激烈的斗争。英、法帝国主义者勾结以色列发动对埃及的武装侵略，其目的不仅仅是要侵占苏伊士运河，而且是想推翻埃及政府，扩大对北非和中东各国的侵略。它们企图通过镇压埃及人民维护主权和独立的斗争，来恢复和巩固它们在亚非地区的殖民统治，挽救世界殖民制度的灭亡。
    但是，英、法帝国主义者过低估计了埃及人民的力量，也过低估计了世界反对殖民主义、维护和平的力量。侵略者遭到了埃及人民的坚决抵抗。随着速战速决的希望的幻灭，帝国主义者面临了不可克服的重重困难。阿拉伯国家一致支持埃及，他们的坚强团结，使得帝国主义者的挑拨分化、各个击破的策略无所施其技。亚非各国人民和全世界爱好和平的人民对侵略者的愤怒谴责和对埃及人民的坚决支持，使得侵略者在政治上和道义上完全孤立，并且面临着不可预测的严重后果。苏联对英、法、以色列提出的严厉警告，给了肆无忌惮的侵略者当头一棒，迫使它们不能不冷静考虑。在埃及人民和世界和平力量的压力下面，侵略者在侵占塞得港以后，只好被迫同意停火。
    帝国主义者原来以为，如果它们能够在匈牙利得手，它们就能在东欧进一步制造紧张局势，钳制和削弱世界和平运动的主力——社会主义国家的力量。它们原来以为，如果它们能够在埃及得手，它们就能缩小和打烂和平地区，对主张和平中立的国家施加强大的压力，迫使它们追随战争政策。它们原来以为，这样就能破坏世界的和平运动，而使战争势力占上风。但是，事实证明，它们的这个打算也落空了。
                三、和平力量大于战争力量
    埃及事件和匈牙利事件证明了这样一个事实：在世界范围内，和平力量大于战争力量。现在，斗争还远没有结束，局势还很紧张。但是，已经可以看出，和平力量同战争势力之间的力量对比，仍然在继续向着有利于和平的方向发展。
    首先，匈牙利反革命分子复辟阴谋的被粉碎，保障了东欧人民民主国家和整个社会主义阵营的安全，减少了在欧洲发生侵略战争的危险。匈牙利事件使社会主义国家的人民更加清楚地看到了帝国主义和反革命分子的凶残面目和阴谋手段，更加认识到了同苏联以及其他社会主义国家紧密团结的必要性。社会主义各国人民的政治积极性和政治警惕性将大大提高。社会主义国家内部的巩固和相互关系的加强，是社会主义国家的强大力量的源泉，也是维护世界和平的有力的保证。
    以苏联为首的社会主义国家在埃及人民反抗侵略的斗争中，给了埃及人民以坚决的支持，鼓舞了全世界反殖民主义的斗争。社会主义国家的威望比从前更加增长了、争取独立的各国人民更加清楚地认识到，以苏联为首的社会主义国家是他们的最可信赖的朋友。苏联对英、法侵略者的严重警告，在迫使英、法同意停火中起了决定性的作用。这充分表现了社会主义国家力量的强大和道义上的坚强地位。
    在埃及事件发生以后，世界反殖民主义的力量更加壮大了。英、法对埃及的野蛮侵略，在全世界反对殖民主义、争取独立的人民中，引起了同仇敌忾的情绪。一些阿拉伯国家已经宣布同英、法断绝外交关系。阿拉伯各国人民和亚非各国人民，在面对着帝国主义侵略的情况下空前一致地团结起来。他们以各种各样的方式支持埃及人民，打击侵略者。这是一次反殖民主义力量的大示威，显示了这支力量的无穷的潜力。殖民地人民从埃及人民抵抗侵略者的光辉榜样中看到了自己的未来，将要更加信心百倍地为争取民族独立、维护国家主权而斗争。而英、法帝国主义者却在这一场斗争中削弱了自己的影响和力量，暴露了自己的腐朽和衰老，给自己找来了严重的政治上和经济上的困难，这就加速了它们的没落。
    世界和平力量在继续发展。在联合国大会上，几乎所有国家都要求英、法、以色列立即停止侵略，并且从埃及撤退它们的军队。这是世界和平力量的一次强有力的表现。全世界爱好和平的人民从埃及事件中具体看到了帝国主义战争势力的疯狂性和冒险性，这就大大提高了他们的警惕。主张和平中立的国家和这些国家中的人民，也从埃及事件中看到了追随帝国主义战争政策的危险性。他们决不愿意被拖进一场不宣而战的战争，给自己招来毁灭性的灾难。
                四、帝国主义困难重重
    同和平力量的更加强大相反，帝国主义战争势力现在遭到了巨大的困难，它们内部的矛盾正在进一步发展。
    英、法帝国主义在中东的势力和影响，现在已经进一步丧失。由于侵略埃及，英、法自己封锁了苏伊士运河，并且招致了中东油管的破坏。运费的增加以及因此引起的出口的减少，中东石油来源的断绝，侵略埃及的战争费用的浩大开支，使得本来已经十分困难的英、法的经济面临更加危险的境地。英国“新闻纪事报”在11月6日发表的一篇社论中，攻击英国侵略埃及是“彻底拙劣”的政策。它忧虑地说：由于这一政策，“在我国过重的经济负担上，又加上了另一种压之欲碎的重担。”这种情况引起了英、法人民的极大愤怒。
    英、法侵略埃及的行为不但损害了自己的利益，而且也损害了欧洲其他国家的利益。这些国家现在在贸易、航运和石油来源上也遭遇了极大的困难。这就使得英、法同其他欧洲国家之间产生了严重的矛盾，北大西洋集团内部的分歧将更加扩大。
    英、法的侵略行为也加深了巴格达条约集团和东南亚条约集团的危机。参加这些集团的亚洲国家，由于同侵略者在一起而处于非常尴尬的地位，同时它们也从埃及事件中认识到帝国主义组织这些集团的目的究竟是什么。最近巴格达条约集团举行了一次没有英国参加的会议。泰国、巴基斯坦的舆论也对它们的国家参加这种侵略性的军事集团日益不满。
    美国同英、法之间的矛盾更趋尖锐。当然，美国同英法一样，对埃及怀着殖民主义的目的，都要使阿拉伯国家成为发动侵略战争的基地。美国也决不希望埃及的反侵略斗争真正得到胜利。但是，美国在埃及事件中假装好人，要求英、法、以色列停火并且撤退它们的军队。这是因为美国看到英、法在中东由于武装侵略埃及而丧失了自己的地位，认为这是扩张自己在中东的侵略势力的绝妙机会。美国通过加拿大提出组织联合国紧急部队的方案，企图用联合国紧急部队来接替英、法侵略军队，实现对苏伊士运河的控制，并进而控制埃及和中东。
    同时，美国利用英、法目前的经济困难，正在用向英、法和西欧输出大量的石油来迫使英、法更进一步投靠美国。美国的石油垄断资本和油船制造业想趁此机会大发其财。英、法对美元的依赖将更加加强。因此，英、法虽然急于解决苏伊士运河问题，美国却并不着急，而想使运河问题的解决更有利于美国。
    英、法帝国主义在政治上和道义上的彻底破产，它们的侵略行动给自己招来的各方面的严重困难，侵略性军事集团目前面临的严重危机，美国和英、法之间的分歧和矛盾的增长等等，这一切都说明了帝国主义战争势力在强大的和平力量面前，正处于越来越不利的地位。
        五、坚决为维护世界和平而斗争
    但是，要使目前的紧张局势得到和缓，还需要经过极艰苦的斗争。帝国主义者是决不会自动放下屠刀的。他们完全知道，如果他们这次的罪恶企图被击败，其后果和影响对他们是极其严重的。
    因此，帝国主义者正在为保持和继续制造紧张局势而挣扎。在匈牙利问题上，它们正在世界各地广泛地煽动反苏、反共的气氛，并且企图利用联合国来干涉匈牙利的内政，为以后干涉其他国家的内政开创先例。他们企图利用对匈牙利事件的叫嚷，来掩盖他们在埃及事件中的可耻行为，掩盖他们继续在埃及和中东进行侵略的阴险目的。
    英、法、以色列侵略者现在仍然拒绝遵守联合国大会的决议，不但不肯无条件地从埃及撤退它们的侵略军队，并且还在向那里增兵。它们想尽一切办法要把自己的军事力量留在埃及，以便控制苏伊士运河，并且在达不到这个目的的时候可以随时扩大侵略。它们也在竭力破坏阿拉伯国家之间的团结，挑拨支持埃及人民的苏联、中国和亚非国家同埃及之间的关系。它们企图这样来孤立埃及，以便迫使埃及在联合国部队和苏伊士运河问题上接受它们提出的侵犯埃及主权的无理要求，好达到它们用军事侵略没有能够达到的目的。
    美国虽然同英、法有着尖锐的利害矛盾，但是它认识到英、法侵略者的彻底失败，对整个帝国主义阵营和殖民制度是极为不利的。因此，美国现在支持英、法的无理态度。它现在绝口不提要求英、法立即撤退侵略军队的事情，并且对埃及施加压力，企图使埃及同意联合国部队享有超过联合国大会决议所规定的权限，以便为国际管制苏伊士运河打下基础。美国对英、法、以色列拒绝撤兵和增加侵略军队并不表示反对，但是却同英法一起反对维护和平和伸张正义的国家的志愿人员到埃及去支援埃及人民。这实际上就是纵容和支持英、法扩大侵略的打算。
    同时，美国积极利用这个机会制造紧张局势。美国已经命令它在太平洋和大西洋海、空军进入所谓“戒备状态”，把它的海、空军力量调往大西洋东部和太平洋西部。美国企图这样来恫吓支持埃及的国家和人民，迫使它们在美国的战争威胁面前放弃对埃及的支持。另一方面，美国的这种行动也是为了维系各个军事侵略集团，防止它们的涣散和离心倾向的更进一步发展。
    由此可见，帝国主义战争势力并不甘心，它们还想卷土重来。目前紧张局势还没有和缓下来，对和平的威胁也还严重存在。继续为制止帝国主义的战争阴谋、为和缓国际紧张局势而斗争，仍然是全世界爱好和平的人民面临的一个严重任务。
    因此，我国人民必须大力支持匈牙利人民，巩固他们在同反革命分子作斗争中所取得的胜利，坚决反对西方帝国主义者借联合国作为幌子对匈牙利内政进行非法干涉的阴谋。我国人民必须以一切力量支援埃及人民，支持他们反抗侵略、维护主权和独立的斗争，要求英、法、以色列侵略军队立即无条件从埃及撤退，反对联合国紧急部队拥有任何侵犯埃及主权的权限，反对把英、法、以色列侵略埃及同苏伊士运河问题混为一谈的企图。只要全世界爱好和平的人民团结起来，坚定不移地同战争势力作斗争，那末，国际紧张局势就有可能转向缓和，严重的战争威胁就有可能被消除，世界持久和平的局面最后就有可能出现。
