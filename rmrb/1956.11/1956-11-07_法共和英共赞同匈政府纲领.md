Xinhua News Agency, November 6th, dispatch from TASS, Paris: The French newspaper "l'Humanité" published a statement by the Political Bureau of the French Communist Party on the 5th. The statement expressed satisfaction that the Hungarian government, with the cooperation of Soviet troops, had blocked the path of counter-revolutionary and fascist forces attempting to restore the capitalist system in Hungary. The Political Bureau also expressed satisfaction with the establishment of the Hungarian Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government and fully endorsed its work.
	The statement said that the French working class, all democrats and patriots know that if the system that paved the way for fascism was restored in Hungary, it would not only be a great threat to the Soviet Union and the socialist camp countries, but also a great threat to world peace, which is already facing the serious danger of armed revanchist Germany. Patriots who do not want the remnants of Hitler to come back to power and who do not want the cause of world peace to be threatened stand on the side of the Hungarian working people, who, with the help of the Soviet Union, are fighting together to protect their socialist achievements and to protect freedom and peace.

Xinhua News Agency, November 6th, dispatch from TASS, London, November 5th: The Executive Committee of the British Communist Party issued a statement on the situation in Hungary. The statement praised the program of the new Hungarian government and believed that Soviet assistance to Hungary in defending the socialist system was in line with maintaining peace and the interests of the working class around the world.
	The statement said that the best representatives of the Hungarian workers' movement, under the leadership of János Kádár, formed a new government. This government put forward a program that advocated Hungarian independence, defended the socialist democratic system, defended the achievements of twelve years of construction, adopted new progressive measures, corrected all abuses of power, and cooperated with all socialist and people's democratic countries on an equal basis.
	The Executive Committee of the British Communist Party believes that the actions of the new Hungarian government and the Soviet army will be supported by communist parties and socialist parties in various countries, and expressed solidarity with the Hungarian working people in their struggle against counter-revolutionaries and reactionaries.

    新华社6日讯　塔斯社巴黎讯：法国“人道报”5日发表了法国共产党政治局的声明，这项声明对匈牙利政府在苏联军队的配合下堵塞了企图在匈牙利恢复资本主义制度的反革命和法西斯势力的道路感到满意。政治局还对匈牙利工农革命政府的成立表示满意，并且完全赞同这个政府的工作。
    声明说，法国的工人阶级，一切民主人士和爱国者都知道，如果为法西斯主义开辟道路的制度在匈牙利复辟了，那不仅对苏联和社会主义阵营国家是一个巨大的威胁，而且对已经面临武装复仇主义德国的严重危险的全世界和平也是一个巨大的威胁。不希望希特勒余孽重新当政，不希望全世界和平事业遭到威胁的爱国者站在匈牙利劳动人民这一边，他们共同在苏联协助下为保护自己的社会主义成果，为保护自由和和平而进行斗争。
    新华社6日讯　据塔斯社伦敦5日讯：英国共产党执行委员会发表了关于匈牙利局势的声明。声明赞扬匈牙利新政府的纲领，并且认为苏联帮助匈牙利保卫社会主义制度是符合维护和平和全世界工人阶级利益的。
