Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 23rd. In the first three years and more of the First Five-Year Plan, Anshan Iron and Steel Company has already accumulated a large amount of construction funds for the country. An official from Anshan Iron and Steel told a Xinhua News Agency reporter: From 1953 to now, the profits, taxes, and depreciation fees turned over to the state by Anshan Iron and Steel have greatly exceeded the state's entire investment in the construction of Anshan Iron and Steel. The accumulated funds could be used to build several new-style automobile factories of the same scale as the First Automobile Works, or to build dozens of Anshan Iron and Steel's seamless steel tube plants.

The growth rate of Anshan Iron and Steel's accumulation of funds for the country is very fast. In 1955, the profits turned over to the state by Anshan Iron and Steel increased by more than 120 million yuan compared to 1954. The profits turned over to the state in the first ten and a half months of this year have greatly exceeded the total profits for the entire year of 1953. The large-scale rolling mill, seamless steel tube plant, No. 8 and No. 7 blast furnaces, and other projects built by Anshan Iron and Steel in the early stage of the First Five-Year Plan have, after several years of production accumulation, now largely recovered all the funds used by the state to invest in the construction of these projects.

In the past three years, Anshan Iron and Steel has overfulfilled its profit delivery plan every year, but the completion of this year's profit delivery plan is not very good. Therefore, Anshan Iron and Steel is currently taking various measures to strive to complete this year's profit delivery plan.

    鞍钢为国家积累大量建设资金
    大大超过了国家建设鞍钢的全部投资
    新华社鞍山23日电　在第一个五年计划前三年多的时间里，鞍山钢铁公司已经为国家积累了大量的建设资金。鞍钢公司的一位负责人告诉新华社记者：从1953年开始到现在，鞍钢上缴给国家的利润、税金和折旧费，已经大大超过了国家建设鞍钢的全部投资。用积累的资金进行建设，足可以新建好几座像第一汽车厂同样规模的新型汽车厂，或者建设数十座鞍钢的无缝钢管厂。
    鞍钢为国家积累资金的增长速度是很快的。1955年鞍钢上缴给国家的利润比1954年增加了一亿二千多万元。今年十个半月上缴给国家的利润，又大大超过了1953年全年的利润。鞍钢在第一个五年计划初期建成的大型轧钢厂、无缝钢管厂、八号、七号炼铁炉等工程，经过这几年来的生产积累，现在大都收回了国家投资建设这些工程所用的全部资金。
    过去三年中，鞍钢年年超额完成上缴利润计划，可是今年上缴利润计划完成的情况并不怎么好。因此，目前鞍钢正在采取各种措施，争取完成今年的上缴利润计划。
