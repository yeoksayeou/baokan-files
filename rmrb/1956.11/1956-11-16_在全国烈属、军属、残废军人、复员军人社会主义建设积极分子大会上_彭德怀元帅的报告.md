Xinhua News Agency, 15th:  Vice Premier of the State Council and Minister of National Defense Marshal Peng Dehuai's report at the National Congress of Active Elements in Socialist Construction among Families of Revolutionary Martyrs, Military Dependents, Disabled Veterans, and Demobilized Soldiers today is as follows:

Comrade Representatives:

Your conference is about to conclude. Over the past few days, many responsible comrades have spoken and delivered reports at the conference. Many of you have also spoken, exchanging valuable production experiences and work experiences. This will be beneficial for future work. I don't have much more to say, but I would like to offer some suggestions for your reference in future work.

You and those you represent – the families of revolutionary martyrs, military dependents, disabled veterans, and demobilized soldiers across the country – have all made various contributions to the cause of the Chinese people's revolution. The ability of the Chinese people to overthrow the rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, to escape a life of oppression and exploitation, and to smoothly carry out socialist construction is inseparable from the bloodshed, sacrifice, and hard work of revolutionary martyrs, disabled veterans, and demobilized soldiers. Some of the representatives present here have had family members give their lives for the revolutionary cause; some have family members currently performing the sacred duty of defending the motherland. Some of you were wounded, bled, or became ill and disabled in revolutionary wars and work; some of you, after serving in the military for a long time, have returned to your hometowns to participate in construction work. You have all contributed to the country and the people. The people of the whole country will not forget your achievements. Disabled veterans and demobilized soldiers are glorious, and the families of martyrs and military dependents are worthy of the people's love. All martyrs who sacrificed for the revolutionary cause will always be remembered by the people. The Party and the government's many regulations and measures regarding preferential treatment and relief for families of martyrs and military dependents, regarding the care and treatment of disabled veterans, and regarding the resettlement and employment of demobilized soldiers, as well as the many cares given in these aspects, are entirely necessary and appropriate.

Currently, the people of our whole country are actively engaged in socialist construction, aiming to build our country into a great socialist nation. To ensure the realization of this tremendous task, the most important thing is to do a good job in two aspects: one is the country's economic construction work, and the other is the work of defending the achievements of national construction. These two aspects of work are indispensable. Every citizen, as long as they have a certain work ability and labor capacity, should participate in one aspect of the work according to the needs of the country, contributing their labor and wisdom to accelerate the progress of our country's socialist construction. You and the families of revolutionary martyrs, military dependents, disabled veterans, and demobilized soldiers throughout the country have not only participated in one aspect of our country's construction work, but the vast majority of comrades have participated in both aspects of the work. The families of martyrs and military dependents have their relatives in the army defending the motherland on the one hand, and are actively participating in economic construction on the other; disabled veterans and demobilized soldiers have contributed to the struggle to defend the motherland on the one hand, and have actively devoted themselves to economic construction after leaving the army on the other. Especially you, the representatives present here, your relatives or yourselves have not only established meritorious service in the Liberation War and on the front lines of defending the motherland, but also created outstanding achievements on today's economic construction front. You are active elements in the cause of people's liberation and the defense of the motherland, and you are also active elements in building the motherland. You are worthy of being outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese people, and you have set a glorious example for the people of the whole country.

Therefore, your responsibilities and the expectations of the Party and the government for you are even greater. The Party and the government not only hope that you will do a good job in your own production and work, and not only hope that you will use your advanced production level and work level to lead the general producers and workers, but more importantly, hope that you will use your exemplary actions to encourage the vast number of families of martyrs, military dependents, disabled veterans, and demobilized soldiers to do better in production and work, and to continuously improve their lives on the basis of doing a good job in production and work, just like you. Therefore, you should consciously and actively assist the Party and the government in carrying out various tasks for the families of martyrs, military dependents, disabled veterans, and demobilized soldiers throughout the country.

What kind of work should you be doing? In my opinion, the most important are the following:

First, you should, through your own exemplary role, use your practical actions and personal experiences to mobilize and promote all families of martyrs, military dependents, disabled veterans, and demobilized soldiers to actively participate in various productive labor and construction work that they can participate in. You should make everyone understand that the families of martyrs, military dependents, disabled veterans, and demobilized soldiers are, of course, glorious and worthy of respect, but if anyone thinks that they can use these honors as capital, thinks that they should be special and superior, does not want to participate in production, does not want to participate in work, and only wants to demand excessive preferential treatment from the Party and the government, then they may lose their glory and the respect of the people. Everyone should understand that the government should try its best to take care of the production and work of the families of martyrs, military dependents, disabled veterans, and demobilized soldiers, but it is also inappropriate if one does not consider the government's difficulties and demands excessive care; only wants to participate in lighter labor, and is unwilling to participate in heavier labor that they can participate in; and only wants to work in the city, and is unwilling to return to the countryside for production. It should be recognized that glory belongs to those who do not spare their labor for the revolutionary cause. No matter what kind of production or work they are engaged in, only hard work can be exchanged for excellent results and greater contributions to the motherland.

Second, you should use your exemplary examples to influence all families of martyrs, military dependents, disabled veterans, and demobilized soldiers to respect local cadres and unite with the local masses. You should make everyone understand that even if one has contributed to the revolution, one should not be arrogant and complacent, and should not be divorced from the masses. No matter how much knowledge one has or how great one's work ability is, one should not despise local cadres. One must know that one's own knowledge is always limited. Only those who have made contributions can be more respected if they are more humble and modest, and they can continue to improve themselves. Those who have the ability only have the obligation to help others and help the masses, and do not have the right to despise others or look down on the masses. If someone with ability cannot help others or the masses, then even if their ability is great, it is useless. Especially for those who are relatively weak in ability and have relatively low political awareness, more patient and specific help should be given. If one only knows how to offer blunt opinions and criticize their shortcomings, then one will not be able to improve unity or get things done well. We should often promote what Chairman Mao said: "Modesty helps one to progress, arrogance makes one lag behind." Encourage everyone to always maintain a humble attitude, always stand among the masses, and not have any arrogance or special demands.

Third, you should use your practical actions to promote the spirit of mutual help among the families of martyrs, military dependents, disabled veterans, and demobilized soldiers, and overcome difficulties in daily life. According to our understanding, there are still many difficulties in everyone's lives. Of course, the government should try its best to solve some specific difficulties, but it is impossible to rely entirely on and wait for the government to solve them. We must promote the spirit of mutual assistance among everyone in order to solve them better and more promptly. Those who are wealthier should help those who are poor, and those who have labor power should help those who do not have labor power. Attention should also be paid to helping mediate family disputes among some people. Since everyone was able to share life and death and share hardships in the years of revolutionary war, they should be more mutually helpful and loving in their current lives. For the general masses, the same need to promote this spirit of mutual assistance and mutual love.

Finally, you should consciously become a bridge between the Party and the government and the general families of martyrs, military dependents, disabled veterans, and demobilized soldiers. You should often promote the Party and government's policies and regulations regarding the families of martyrs, military dependents, disabled veterans, and demobilized soldiers, often introduce relevant situations to everyone, and make appropriate explanations for certain misunderstandings or incorrect views that exist, and eliminate undue dissatisfaction. At the same time, you should also help some comrades reflect to higher authorities the problems that urgently need to be solved but have not been solved, as well as the problems that have been solved very inappropriately, and seek assistance from the government to solve and handle them correctly. We also hope that you will reflect the people's criticisms and suggestions to the army in many ways, actively help the army overcome its shortcomings and improve its work, and further strengthen the relationship between the army and the people.

Comrades, these are some of the hopes I want to put forward. I feel that the responsibilities of all the representatives are great. At present, our country has a large number of families of martyrs and military dependents, and more than five million demobilized and transferred soldiers. After the country implements the compulsory military service system, a large number of soldiers retire and return to their hometowns from the army every year. This is a huge force in our country's socialist construction. There is no doubt that if you actively assist the government in enabling so many people to do their best and get what they deserve, and give full play to the role of this huge force, it will not only be of great significance to our country's socialist economic construction, but also be of great help to our country's national defense construction in the future.

Comrades, your work is important, the Party and the government support you, the people of the whole country love you, and the families of martyrs, military dependents, disabled veterans, and demobilized soldiers throughout the country trust you. Your work will surely achieve greater success. I wish you success in your work and good health!

    在全国烈属、军属、残废军人、复员军人社会主义建设积极分子大会上
    彭德怀元帅的报告
    新华社15日讯　国务院副总理、国防部长彭德怀元帅今天在全国烈属、军属、残废军人、复员军人社会主义建设积极分子大会上的报告，全文如下：各位代表，各位同志：
    你们的大会，不久就要结束了。几天来，许多负责同志在会上讲了话，作了报告。你们也有不少同志发了言，相互交流了宝贵的生产经验和工作经验。这对于今后工作都是很有益处的。我已经没有很多话要讲了，只是想向同志们提出一些希望，作为大家今后工作的参考。
    你们和你们所代表的全国烈士家属、军人家属、残废军人和复员军人，对我国人民革命事业都是有过各种贡献的。我国人民能够推翻帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的统治，摆脱被压迫、被剥削的生活，顺利地进行着社会主义建设，这是和革命烈士们、残废军人和复员军人们过去的流血牺牲、艰苦奋斗分不开的。在座的各位代表中，有的亲人为革命事业付出了自己的生命；有的亲人正在执行着保卫祖国的神圣职责。你们中间有的人在革命战争中和工作中负了伤，流了血，得了病，成了残废；有的人在长期服兵役以后，又复员回乡，参加建设工作。你们都是有功于国家，有功于人民的。全国人民对于你们的功绩是不会忘记的。残废军人和复员军人是光荣的，烈士家属和军人家属，是值得人民爱戴的。一切为革命事业而牺牲的烈士将永远受到人民的纪念。党和政府关于烈属、军属的优待救济，关于残废军人的抚养治疗，关于复员军人的安置就业等许多规定和措施，在这些方面所给予的许多关怀，也完全是必要的和应当的。
    现在我们全国人民正在积极地进行着社会主义建设，要把我国建成为一个伟大的社会主义国家。为着保证实现这个巨大的任务，最重要的是要做好两方面的工作，一方面是国家的经济建设工作，另一方面是保卫国家建设成果的工作。这两方面的工作是缺一不可的。每一个公民，只要具有一定的工作能力和劳动能力，就应当根据国家的需要参加一个方面的工作，贡献出自己的劳动和智慧，加速我国社会主义建设事业的前进。你们和全国的烈属、军属、残废军人、复员军人，不仅参加了我们国家建设中的一个方面的工作，而且绝大多数同志是参加了两个方面的工作。烈属、军属一方面有着自己的亲人在军队中保卫祖国，另一方面自己又积极地参加着经济建设；残废军人、复员军人一方面在保卫祖国的斗争中出过力，另一方面在离开军队之后又积极地投入了经济建设。特别是在座的各位代表同志，你们的亲人或者你们自己不仅在解放战争中和保卫祖国的战线上树立过功勋，而且在今天的经济建设战线上也创造了优异的成绩。你们是人民解放事业和保卫祖国的积极分子，同时又是建设祖国的积极分子。你们不愧为我国人民的优秀儿女，你们给全国人民树立了光荣的榜样。
    因此，你们的责任，党和政府对你们的期望，也就更大了。党和政府不只是希望你们把自己的生产和工作搞好，也不只是希望你们以自己的先进生产水平和工作水平带动一般的生产者和工作者，更重要的是希望以你们的模范行动带动广大的烈属、军属、残废军人和复员军人能和你们一样地把生产搞得更好，工作做得更好，并在搞好生产、做好工作的基础上不断地改善他们的生活。所以你们应当自觉地、主动地协助党和政府向全国的烈属、军属、残废军人和复员军人进行各种工作。
    你们应当进行什么工作呢？据我看，最主要的是以下几项工作：
    第一、应当通过你们自己的模范作用，用你们的实际行动和亲身经历，动员和推动所有的烈属、军属、残废军人和复员军人积极参加他们可能参加的各种生产劳动和各种建设工作。你们应当使大家懂得，烈属、军属、残废军人和复员军人，固然是光荣的，是值得尊敬的，但是如果有人认为可以把这些荣誉当成资本，认为自己应该特殊和高人一等，不想参加生产，不想参加工作，只想向党和政府要求过高的优待，那就可能失去自己的光荣，失去人民的尊敬。应当使大家了解，政府对烈属、军属、残废军人和复员军人的生产和工作，是应当尽量照顾的，但如果不设想政府的困难，要求过分的照顾；只想参加较轻的劳动，不愿参加可能参加的较重的劳动；只想在城市工作，不愿回到农村生产，也是不妥当的。应当认识，光荣是归于为革命事业而不吝惜自己劳动的人，不论从事哪一种生产或工作，只有辛勤的劳动，才能换得优良成绩和对祖国的更大贡献。
    第二、应当用你们的模范榜样，来影响全体烈属、军属、残废军人和复员军人，尊重当地干部，团结当地群众。你们应当使大家懂得，对革命有功也不应该骄傲自满，脱离群众。自己见识再多，工作能力再大也不应该轻视当地干部，要知道自己的知识总是有限的，有功绩的人只有更加谦逊虚心，才能更受人尊敬，自己也才能继续进步。有能力的人只有帮助别人、帮助群众的义务，没有轻视别人、看不起群众的权利。如果有能力的人不能帮助别人，不能帮助群众，即使能力再大也是没有用的。特别是对于那些能力比较弱的政治觉悟比较低的人们，更要进行耐心的具体的帮助，如果只知道生硬的提意见，指责他们的缺点，那就既不能搞好团结，也不能把事情办好。应当经常向大家宣传毛主席所说的话：“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后。”勉励大家永远保持虚心的态度，永远站在群众之中，不要有丝毫的骄傲和特殊要求。
  第三、应当以你们的实际行动，在烈属、军属、残废军人和复员军人之间发扬互相帮助的精神，克服日常生活中的困难。据我们了解，目前在大家的生活当中，困难还是比较多的。有些具体困难，政府当然应该尽力解决，但是完全依靠和等待政府来解决也是不可能的，必须发扬大家的互助精神，才可能解决得更好更及时，生活富裕些的应当帮助贫困的，有劳动力的应当帮助没有劳动力的。也要注意帮助调解某些人的家庭纠纷问题，既然大家在革命战争的年代里能够同生死、共患难，在目前的生活中就应当更加互助互爱。对于一般群众，同样需要发扬这种互助互爱的精神。
    最后，你们应当自觉地成为党和政府同一般烈属、军属、残废军人、复员军人之间的桥梁。你们应当经常向大家宣传党和政府对待烈属、军属、残废军人、复员军人的政策和规定，经常向大家介绍有关的情况，对存在的某些误解或错误看法，要进行恰当的解释，消除不应有的不满。同时也应该帮助某些同志把迫切需要解决而没有得到解决的问题，以及解决得很不恰当的问题，及时向上级反映，求得协助政府正确地解决和处理。更希望你们多方面反映人民群众对军队的批评和建议，积极帮助军队克服缺点，改进工作，进一步密切军民关系。
    同志们，我所要提的一些希望就是这些。我感到各位代表的责任是重大的。目前我国有为数众多的烈属、军属群众，有五百多万复员转业军人，国家实行义务兵役制以后，军队中每年还有大批的军人退伍回乡。这是我国社会主义建设事业中一支巨大的力量。毫无疑问，如果你们积极地协助政府使这样多的人各尽所能，各得其所，把这一支巨大力量的作用充分发挥起来，不仅对于我国社会主义经济建设有重大的意义，而且对于今后我国的国防建设也有很大的帮助。
    同志们，你们的工作是重要的，党和政府是支持你们的，全国人民是爱戴你们的，全国的烈属、军属、残废军人、复员军人是信任你们的，你们的工作，一定会取得更大的成绩。预祝同志们工作胜利，身体健康！
