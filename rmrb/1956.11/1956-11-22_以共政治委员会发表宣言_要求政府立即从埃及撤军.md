Xinhua News Agency, Tel Aviv, November 20th -- TASS reported: The Political Committee of the Israeli Communist Party published a declaration in "People's Voice" entitled: "Israeli Armed Forces Should Immediately Withdraw Behind the Armistice Line."

The Political Committee emphasized: "The invasion of Egypt by the Israeli army in conjunction with the aggressive armies of British and French colonialism has aroused the indignation of the people of the world… The resolution of the Emergency Session of the United Nations General Assembly, passed by sixty-five votes to one (the Israeli representative), regarding the immediate withdrawal of the armed forces of the interveners, truly reflects public opinion."

The declaration continued: "We have not moved closer to Israeli-Arab peace, but are further from it, and Israel is now in an unprecedented state of isolation. The war launched by the government to cater to the interests of foreign colonialism and for its own expansion has failed. This government should resign as soon as possible before it brings misfortune to Israel. Although the government verbally expresses its hope to hold peace talks with Arab countries, as long as it does not give up the territories it occupies, its words are nothing but empty talk. Everyone who hopes for peace should do everything possible to resolutely strive for the immediate withdrawal of Israeli troops from the Sinai Peninsula and the Gaza Strip… It is clear that even the slightest delay in the implementation of the United Nations General Assembly resolution contains the most serious consequences for our country, our people, and the cause of peace."

    以共政治委员会发表宣言
    要求政府立即从埃及撤军
    新华社21日讯　塔斯社特拉维夫20日讯：以色列共产党政治委员会在“人民呼声报”上发表了宣言，标题是：“以色列武装部队应当立即撤退到停战线后面”。
    政治委员会着重指出：“以色列军队会同英国和法国殖民主义者的侵略军队侵入埃及，引起了全世界人民的义愤………联合国大会紧急会议以六十五票对以色列代表一票通过的关于干涉者武装部队立刻撤出埃及的决议，真实地反映出公众的意见。”
    宣言又说：“我们并没有接近以色列—阿拉伯和平，而是离它更远了，以色列现在陷于空前未有的孤立境地。政府为了迎合外国殖民主义的利益和为了自己的扩张而发动的战争遭到了失败。这个政府应当趁早在还没有给以色列带来不幸之前辞职。政府尽管口头上表示希望同阿拉伯国家举行和谈，然而只要它一天不放弃它所占领的土地，它的话就不外是一种空话。每一个希望和平的人应当竭尽全力坚决争取以色列军队立刻撤出西奈半岛和加沙地区……很明显，对联合国大会决议的执行那怕有一点拖延，都会包含着对我们国家、我们人民和对和平事业的最严重的后果。”
