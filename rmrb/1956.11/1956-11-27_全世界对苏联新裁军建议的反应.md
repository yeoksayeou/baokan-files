Worldwide Reactions to the New Soviet Disarmament Proposals
Hu Jin
The Soviet government's new disarmament proposals, put forward on November 17, have attracted great attention from world opinion.

Socialist countries and all peace-loving nations generally welcome the Soviet proposals, considering them an important step in easing international tensions.

Egypt and other Arab countries, which are in the midst of imperialist aggression and the threat of war, have reacted particularly strongly to the Soviet proposals. Egypt's "Al-Ahram" pointed out that recent events in the Near East prove the necessity of disarmament and the easing of international tensions. A Syrian government spokesman commented that the Soviet government's statement is fully in line with the Soviet Union's traditional policy, which is based on the principle of peaceful coexistence, taking as its starting point the necessity of disarmament, the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons, and opposition to aggression.

It is precisely in light of the urgent situation in which peace is seriously threatened by imperialist military adventures in the Middle East that the Soviet Union has once again issued a call for disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons.

Since the Soviet proposals have removed the pretext for the United States to obstruct disarmament, providing a good basis for breaking the deadlock on the disarmament issue, they have also aroused many positive reactions in Western public opinion.

Western reports cannot but acknowledge that the numbers of armed forces to be reduced in stages by major powers proposed in the new Soviet proposals "are the same as those included in the various proposals of the United States or Britain and France" (Agence France-Presse), and that the Soviet Union's willingness to consider the US's open-sky inspection proposal is "a noteworthy new component" ("New York Times"), and that this is "a surprising concession" (West German "General News"). The British "Reynolds News" pointed out: "Since the Russian proposals help to ease international tensions, they should be carefully studied." The newspaper also reasonably pointed out that if war is not desired, peaceful coexistence with the Soviet Union is necessary, so "every possibility must be used to negotiate peace with the Soviet Union." Anyone who has noticed the repeated statements by British leaders in the first half of this year expressing their willingness to promote peaceful coexistence with the Soviet Union will consider these words of "Reynolds News" to be weighty.

It can be seen that the Soviet proposals have put the international reactionary forces attempting to exacerbate tensions in a difficult and flustered situation. Officials in Washington, London, and Paris have all stated that the Soviet proposals must be studied "cautiously" and "carefully." They feel compelled to take public opinion pressure seriously. According to an Agence France-Presse dispatch from New York, "American sources believe that it is difficult to give a completely negative answer" because it is necessary to "avoid giving the impression that only the Soviet Union is leading the struggle for peace and security." However, Washington is trying its best to pretend that the Soviet Union "has not put forward anything new," and an Associated Press dispatch from Washington also revealed that the Soviet proposals "seem unlikely to receive unconditional agreement from the United States." Reuters reported that London officials still want to insist that disarmament should be conditional on resolving "outstanding political issues." This can only be seen as still wanting to stand pat on the position that created the stalemate.

The Adenauer government's panic and unease over the Soviet proposals particularly clearly demonstrates the mentality of the forces hostile to disarmament. West German government spokesman Eckardt insisted that the issue of the withdrawal of foreign troops from Germany mentioned in the Soviet proposals was "very untimely"; and said that if these proposals were implemented, "the entire Western treaty system" would collapse. It is well known that the West German government has consistently acted as the vanguard against disarmament, colluding with Washington to obstruct disarmament, believing that disarmament would be a fatal blow to their plans to revive West German militarism and strengthen the North Atlantic military bloc.

The United States and its followers are trying their best to belittle the significance of the Soviet proposals, attempting to create an atmosphere of public confusion so that they can once again escape from their predicament and remain entrenched in their position of obstructing disarmament for eleven years.

Western propaganda organs first want to obliterate the important fact that the Soviet Union's new disarmament proposals are another effort by the Soviet Union to ease tensions in recent times. They insist that the Soviet proposals are a "new tactic" to "divert attention." However, this distortion of propaganda cannot fool anyone. The "Times of India" warned: "It would be premature to disregard the very influential Bulganin proposals as merely a tactical move to divert attention from the events in Hungary." India, Syria, and other Arab countries, as well as fair-minded public opinion around the world, have pointed out that it is precisely the imperialist bloc that is trying to divert people's attention from their aggressive activities. The Soviet Union's assistance to the Hungarian people in crushing the imperialist subversion plot is a just action, just as the Soviet Union's support for Egypt against the war of aggression is a just action. The imperialist bloc is trying its best to distort this fact and incite anti-Soviet and anti-communist hysteria, with the aim of using it to revive the "Cold War" and create tensions. Their current attempt to make people unaware of the role of the new Soviet disarmament proposals in helping to ease tensions is also for this despicable purpose.

Now is the time not to allow the imperialist bloc to divert attention, to thoroughly expose and oppose their conspiracy to undermine peace, so that the situation can be eased again. The new Soviet disarmament proposals are precisely such an extremely timely and powerful step.

The international reactionary forces see this. They are preparing public opinion for once again rejecting the Soviet disarmament proposals, repeating the old clich√©s, and still calling this new proposal of the Soviet Union a so-called "propaganda offensive." However, this clumsy trick has long been bankrupt. When the Soviet Union proposed on May 14 that all countries implement unilateral disarmament before reaching a disarmament agreement, Dulles also insisted that this proposal was a meaningless "propaganda gesture." However, when the Soviet Union put forward its proposal at that time, it took the lead in taking the practical action of again unilaterally reducing its troops by 1.2 million, and other socialist countries also carried out disarmament one after another. If the United States also learned from the example of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries and reduced its armaments, it would have long strengthened international trust, and the deadlock on the disarmament issue could have been broken long ago. But what did the United States do? It only shouted about disarmament in vain, but in reality, it not only did not want to disarm, but also openly continued to expand the arms race. The United States has even refused to stop the testing of atomic and hydrogen weapons. Now the Soviet proposals have put the United States to another serious test. This is by no means "propaganda."

People are paying particular attention to the attitude of Western countries towards the Soviet proposal to hold a five-nation summit and a broader international conference. In the current situation, in addition to continuing to make efforts to resolve the disarmament issue in the United Nations, it is urgently necessary to hold such an international conference to seek ways to reach a disarmament agreement. In view of the fact that the disarmament negotiations at the United Nations have been fruitless for eleven years, it is particularly necessary to hold direct international negotiations. The "Times of India" pointed out: The disarmament issue has been submitted to the United Nations for discussion, but this fact alone does not necessarily preclude conducting relatively informal and less public discussions outside the United Nations meetings. Today, it is more necessary than ever to achieve mutual understanding between major powers. But according to a Reuters report, Washington actually believes that the Soviet proposals "do not provide a new basis for holding a summit meeting." Associated Press reporter Hightower's report from Washington even insisted that holding an international conference would "greatly damage" the prestige of the United Nations organization. This trick of obliterating the facts can be described as astonishing. Last year's Geneva Four-Power Summit discussed the disarmament issue, and this meeting greatly helped to promote international trust and ease international tensions, which not only did not weaken the United Nations, but only strengthened the role of the United Nations. Now, the Soviet proposals not only contain many parts that countries have already reached agreement on in the past, but also indicate that they can consider the open-sky inspection proposal put forward by the US President at the Four-Power Summit. Therefore, the Soviet proposals have obviously provided a solid basis for holding an international conference and leading to an agreement. If it is not intentional to continue to obstruct disarmament and create tensions, Western countries have no reason to refuse to hold such international consultations.

US President's Disarmament Advisor Stassen stated on the 19th that the United States will still "maintain a large amount of modern forces as an atomic shield." What is the intention of re-emphasizing the bankrupt policy of atomic blackmail at this time? Obviously, this kind of argument is completely contrary to seriously considering the new Soviet disarmament proposals and seeking an agreement on disarmament and the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons. From this, it can be seen that it is no accident that the US propaganda organs are trying their best to distort the Soviet proposals and spread an atmosphere of distrust in the negotiated settlement of international issues.

The disarmament issue has been deadlocked for a long time, which only conforms to the interests of the US monopoly capital groups in creating tensions in order to continue to expand the arms race and maintain maximum profits. At this time, supporting the Soviet Union's new disarmament proposals and striving to break the deadlock on the disarmament issue is of particularly great significance.
