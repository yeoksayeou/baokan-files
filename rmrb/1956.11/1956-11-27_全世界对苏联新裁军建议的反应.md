Worldwide Reactions to the New Soviet Disarmament Proposals
Hu Jin
The Soviet government's new disarmament proposals, put forward on November 17, have attracted great attention from world opinion.

Socialist countries and all peace-loving nations generally welcome the Soviet proposals, considering them an important step in easing international tensions.

Egypt and other Arab countries, which are in the midst of imperialist aggression and the threat of war, have reacted particularly strongly to the Soviet proposals. Egypt's "Al-Ahram" pointed out that recent events in the Near East prove the necessity of disarmament and the easing of international tensions. A Syrian government spokesman commented that the Soviet government's statement is fully in line with the Soviet Union's traditional policy, which is based on the principle of peaceful coexistence, taking as its starting point the necessity of disarmament, the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons, and opposition to aggression.

It is precisely in light of the urgent situation in which peace is seriously threatened by imperialist military adventures in the Middle East that the Soviet Union has once again issued a call for disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons.

Since the Soviet proposals have removed the pretext for the United States to obstruct disarmament, providing a good basis for breaking the deadlock on the disarmament issue, they have also aroused many positive reactions in Western public opinion.

Western reports cannot but acknowledge that the numbers of armed forces to be reduced in stages by major powers proposed in the new Soviet proposals "are the same as those included in the various proposals of the United States or Britain and France" (Agence France-Presse), and that the Soviet Union's willingness to consider the US's open-sky inspection proposal is "a noteworthy new component" ("New York Times"), and that this is "a surprising concession" (West German "General News"). The British "Reynolds News" pointed out: "Since the Russian proposals help to ease international tensions, they should be carefully studied." The newspaper also reasonably pointed out that if war is not desired, peaceful coexistence with the Soviet Union is necessary, so "every possibility must be used to negotiate peace with the Soviet Union." Anyone who has noticed the repeated statements by British leaders in the first half of this year expressing their willingness to promote peaceful coexistence with the Soviet Union will consider these words of "Reynolds News" to be weighty.

It can be seen that the Soviet proposals have put the international reactionary forces attempting to exacerbate tensions in a difficult and flustered situation. Officials in Washington, London, and Paris have all stated that the Soviet proposals must be studied "cautiously" and "carefully." They feel compelled to take public opinion pressure seriously. According to an Agence France-Presse dispatch from New York, "American sources believe that it is difficult to give a completely negative answer" because it is necessary to "avoid giving the impression that only the Soviet Union is leading the struggle for peace and security." However, Washington is trying its best to pretend that the Soviet Union "has not put forward anything new," and an Associated Press dispatch from Washington also revealed that the Soviet proposals "seem unlikely to receive unconditional agreement from the United States." Reuters reported that London officials still want to insist that disarmament should be conditional on resolving "outstanding political issues." This can only be seen as still wanting to stand pat on the position that created the stalemate.

The Adenauer government's panic and unease over the Soviet proposals particularly clearly demonstrates the mentality of the forces hostile to disarmament. West German government spokesman Eckardt insisted that the issue of the withdrawal of foreign troops from Germany mentioned in the Soviet proposals was "very untimely"; and said that if these proposals were implemented, "the entire Western treaty system" would collapse. It is well known that the West German government has consistently acted as the vanguard against disarmament, colluding with Washington to obstruct disarmament, believing that disarmament would be a fatal blow to their plans to revive West German militarism and strengthen the North Atlantic military bloc.

The United States and its followers are trying their best to belittle the significance of the Soviet proposals, attempting to create an atmosphere of public confusion so that they can once again escape from their predicament and remain entrenched in their position of obstructing disarmament for eleven years.

Western propaganda organs first want to obliterate the important fact that the Soviet Union's new disarmament proposals are another effort by the Soviet Union to ease tensions in recent times. They insist that the Soviet proposals are a "new tactic" to "divert attention." However, this distortion of propaganda cannot fool anyone. The "Times of India" warned: "It would be premature to disregard the very influential Bulganin proposals as merely a tactical move to divert attention from the events in Hungary." India, Syria, and other Arab countries, as well as fair-minded public opinion around the world, have pointed out that it is precisely the imperialist bloc that is trying to divert people's attention from their aggressive activities. The Soviet Union's assistance to the Hungarian people in crushing the imperialist subversion plot is a just action, just as the Soviet Union's support for Egypt against the war of aggression is a just action. The imperialist bloc is trying its best to distort this fact and incite anti-Soviet and anti-communist hysteria, with the aim of using it to revive the "Cold War" and create tensions. Their current attempt to make people unaware of the role of the new Soviet disarmament proposals in helping to ease tensions is also for this despicable purpose.

Now is the time not to allow the imperialist bloc to divert attention, to thoroughly expose and oppose their conspiracy to undermine peace, so that the situation can be eased again. The new Soviet disarmament proposals are precisely such an extremely timely and powerful step.

The international reactionary forces see this. They are preparing public opinion for once again rejecting the Soviet disarmament proposals, repeating the old clichés, and still calling this new proposal of the Soviet Union a so-called "propaganda offensive." However, this clumsy trick has long been bankrupt. When the Soviet Union proposed on May 14 that all countries implement unilateral disarmament before reaching a disarmament agreement, Dulles also insisted that this proposal was a meaningless "propaganda gesture." However, when the Soviet Union put forward its proposal at that time, it took the lead in taking the practical action of again unilaterally reducing its troops by 1.2 million, and other socialist countries also carried out disarmament one after another. If the United States also learned from the example of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries and reduced its armaments, it would have long strengthened international trust, and the deadlock on the disarmament issue could have been broken long ago. But what did the United States do? It only shouted about disarmament in vain, but in reality, it not only did not want to disarm, but also openly continued to expand the arms race. The United States has even refused to stop the testing of atomic and hydrogen weapons. Now the Soviet proposals have put the United States to another serious test. This is by no means "propaganda."

People are paying particular attention to the attitude of Western countries towards the Soviet proposal to hold a five-nation summit and a broader international conference. In the current situation, in addition to continuing to make efforts to resolve the disarmament issue in the United Nations, it is urgently necessary to hold such an international conference to seek ways to reach a disarmament agreement. In view of the fact that the disarmament negotiations at the United Nations have been fruitless for eleven years, it is particularly necessary to hold direct international negotiations. The "Times of India" pointed out: The disarmament issue has been submitted to the United Nations for discussion, but this fact alone does not necessarily preclude conducting relatively informal and less public discussions outside the United Nations meetings. Today, it is more necessary than ever to achieve mutual understanding between major powers. But according to a Reuters report, Washington actually believes that the Soviet proposals "do not provide a new basis for holding a summit meeting." Associated Press reporter Hightower's report from Washington even insisted that holding an international conference would "greatly damage" the prestige of the United Nations organization. This trick of obliterating the facts can be described as astonishing. Last year's Geneva Four-Power Summit discussed the disarmament issue, and this meeting greatly helped to promote international trust and ease international tensions, which not only did not weaken the United Nations, but only strengthened the role of the United Nations. Now, the Soviet proposals not only contain many parts that countries have already reached agreement on in the past, but also indicate that they can consider the open-sky inspection proposal put forward by the US President at the Four-Power Summit. Therefore, the Soviet proposals have obviously provided a solid basis for holding an international conference and leading to an agreement. If it is not intentional to continue to obstruct disarmament and create tensions, Western countries have no reason to refuse to hold such international consultations.

US President's Disarmament Advisor Stassen stated on the 19th that the United States will still "maintain a large amount of modern forces as an atomic shield." What is the intention of re-emphasizing the bankrupt policy of atomic blackmail at this time? Obviously, this kind of argument is completely contrary to seriously considering the new Soviet disarmament proposals and seeking an agreement on disarmament and the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons. From this, it can be seen that it is no accident that the US propaganda organs are trying their best to distort the Soviet proposals and spread an atmosphere of distrust in the negotiated settlement of international issues.

The disarmament issue has been deadlocked for a long time, which only conforms to the interests of the US monopoly capital groups in creating tensions in order to continue to expand the arms race and maintain maximum profits. At this time, supporting the Soviet Union's new disarmament proposals and striving to break the deadlock on the disarmament issue is of particularly great significance.

    全世界对苏联新裁军建议的反应
    胡今
    苏联政府在11月17日提出的新的裁军建议，引起了世界舆论的巨大注意。
    社会主义国家和所有爱好和平的国家都普遍欢迎苏联的建议，认为这是缓和国际紧张局势的一个重要步骤。
    正处在帝国主义侵略和战争威胁下的埃及和其他阿拉伯国家，对苏联建议的反应特别强烈。埃及“晚报”指出：近东最近的事件证明必须裁军和缓和国际紧张局势。叙利亚政府发言人评论说：苏联政府的声明完全符合苏联的传统政策，这个政策是以和平共处原则作为基础，以必须裁军、禁止原子武器和氢武器以及反对侵略作为出发点。
    苏联正是根据帝国主义在中东的军事冒险使和平遭到严重威胁的紧迫情况，而再一次发出裁军和禁止原子武器的呼吁的。
    由于苏联建议打掉了美国阻挠裁军的借口，为打开裁军问题僵局提供了良好基础，因此，它在西方国家的舆论界也引起了许多肯定的反应。
    西方的报道不能不承认，苏联新建议中提出的大国分期裁减武装部队的数目，“就是美国或者英法的各种建议中所列入的数目”（法新社），苏联表示愿意考虑美国的空中视察建议，是“值得严重注意的新成分”（“纽约时报”），而且这是“一个惊人的让步”（西德“一般新闻”）。英国“雷诺新闻”指出：“既然俄国人的建议有助于缓和国际紧张局势，那就应当仔细地加以研究。”这家报纸还合理地指出：如果不希望战争，就得同苏联和平共处，所以必须利用“一切可能来同苏联进行关于和平的谈判”。凡是注意到英国领导人今年上半年一再表示愿意促进同苏联的和平共处的言论的人，都会认为“雷诺新闻”的这番话应该是有分量的。
    可以看出，苏联的建议使得企图加剧紧张局势的国际反动势力陷于手忙脚乱的困难境地。华盛顿、伦敦和巴黎的官方都表示必须“慎重”而“仔细”地研究苏联建议。它们感到必须认真看待舆论的压力。据法新社纽约电，“美国人士认为，要作完全否定的答复是困难的”，因为需要“避免给人一种印象，仿佛只有苏联在领导争取和平和安全的斗争”。但是，华盛顿方面却竭力装出，似乎苏联“并没有提出什么新东西”，美联社华盛顿电还透露：苏联的建议“看来很难会得到美国的无条件的同意”。路透社报道，伦敦官方人士还想坚持所谓裁军应以解决“悬而未决的政治问题”为先决条件。这只能被认为是仍然想原封不动地站在造成僵局的立场上。
    阿登纳政府对苏联建议的慌张和不安，特别清楚地表明了敌视裁军的势力的心情。西德政府发言人埃卡特硬说苏联建议中所提到的外国军队撤出德国的问题是“很不合时宜”的；并说，如果这些建议实现了的话，“整个的西方条约体系”就会垮台。大家知道，西德政府一直充当反对裁军的急先锋，它同华盛顿勾结在一起，竭力阻挠裁军，认为裁军将是它们复活西德军国主义，加强北大西洋军事集团的计划的致命打击。
    美国及其追随者正在竭力贬低苏联建议的意义，企图制造一种迷惑公众的气氛，使它们得以再一次逃出窘境，坚守在十一年来阻挠裁军的阵地上。
    西方宣传机关首先想抹煞这样一个重要的事实：就是苏联的新裁军建议是苏联在最近时期采取的又一缓和紧张局势的努力。它们硬说苏联的建议是一种“转移注意力”的“新策略”。但是，这个歪曲宣传是骗不了人的。“印度时报”警告说：“把影响很大的布尔加宁的建议当作只是为了转移对匈牙利事件的一种策略性的行动而不予考虑，那就未免为时过早”。印度、叙利亚和其他阿拉伯国家以及世界公正舆论都已指出，正是帝国主义集团在竭力转移人们对它们的侵略活动的注意力。苏联援助匈牙利人民粉碎帝国主义颠复阴谋，是正义的行动，正如苏联支持埃及反对侵略战争是正义的行动一样。帝国主义集团竭力歪曲这一事实，煽动反苏反共歇斯底里，其目的是想借以复活“冷战”，制造紧张局势。它们现在想使人看不见苏联新裁军建议有助于缓和紧张局势的作用，也是为了达到这个卑鄙目的。
    现在就是要不让帝国主义集团转移注意力，要彻底地揭露和反对它们破坏和平的阴谋，以便使局势得以重新缓和下来。苏联新的裁军建议，正是这样一个极其适时而又有力的步骤。
    国际反动势力看到了这一点。它们正在为再一次拒绝苏联裁军建议准备舆论，重弹过去的滥调，把苏联这次的新建议仍然说成所谓“宣传攻势”。但是，这个拙劣的手法，早已破产了。今年5月14日苏联提出各国在达成裁军协议以前实行单独裁军的建议时，杜勒斯也曾硬说这个建议是没有任何意义的“宣传姿态”。可是，苏联当时提出自己的建议时就率先采取了再次单独裁减军队一百二十万人的实际行动，其他社会主义国家也纷纷实行裁军。如果美国也学习苏联和其他社会主义国家的榜样，裁减军备，那就早已加强了国际信任，裁军问题的僵局也早已可以打开。但是，美国做了什么呢？它只是空喊了一阵裁军，实际上却不仅不愿裁军，而且公开在继续扩大军备竞赛。美国连停止原子武器和氢武器的试验，也已加以拒绝。现在苏联建议使美国面临又一严重考验。这决不是什么“宣传”。
    人们特别注意：西方国家对苏联关于举行五国首脑会议和更广泛的国际会议的建议，采取什么态度。在目前局势下，除了在联合国继续为解决裁军问题作出努力以外，举行这样的国际会议，来寻求达成裁军协议的途径，是迫切需要的。鉴于十一年来联合国的裁军谈判一事无成，举行国际的直接谈判，尤有必要。“印度时报”指出：裁军问题已经提交联合国讨论，但是仅仅这个事实并不一定就排除在联合国会议以外进行比较非正式和比较不公开的讨论。今天比过去任何时候都更有必要来取得大国之间的互相谅解。但据路透社报道，华盛顿方面竟认为苏联的建议“并没有提供举行最高级会议的新的基础”。美联社记者海托华从华盛顿的报道，甚至硬说举行国际会议会使联合国组织的威信“大大扫地”。这种抹煞事实的伎俩可谓到了惊人的地步。去年日内瓦四国首脑会议就曾讨论过裁军问题，而这次会议曾大大有助于促进国际信任，并使国际紧张局势趋向缓和，这不仅没有削弱联合国，而且只有加强了联合国的作用。现在苏联的建议不仅很多部分是过去各国已经取得接近和一致了的，而且还表示可以考虑美国总统在四国首脑会议上提出的空中视察的提议。因此苏联建议显然已为举行国际会议并导致协议提供了坚实的基础。如果不是蓄意要继续阻挠裁军，制造紧张局势，西方国家就没有任何理由拒绝举行这样的国际协商。
    美国总统裁军顾问史塔生19日表示，美国仍将“保持大量的现代化力量作为原子盾牌”。他在这个时候重新强调破了产的原子讹诈政策，究竟用意何在？显然，这种论调，同认真考虑苏联新裁军建议，谋求裁军和禁止原子武器氢武器的协议，是完全背道而驰的。从这里可以看出，美国宣传机关竭力歪曲苏联建议，散播对协商解决国际问题的不信任气氛，不是偶然的。
    裁军问题长期陷于僵局，只符合于美国垄断资本集团制造紧张局势，以便继续扩大军备竞赛，保持最大利润的利益。在这时候，支持苏联的新的裁军建议，争取打开裁军问题的僵局的斗争，具有特别重大的意义。
