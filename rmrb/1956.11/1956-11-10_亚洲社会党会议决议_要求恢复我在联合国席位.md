　　Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, November 9th: The Second Plenary Session of the Asian Socialist Conference, which opened in Bombay on November 4th, adopted a resolution on "The Question of the Admission of Member States to the United Nations" on the morning of the 8th, strongly demanding the restoration of China's legitimate seat in the United Nations.
　　The resolution stated: "The conference believes that the current situation in which China's seat in the Security Council and the United Nations General Assembly is occupied by others is abnormal. The conference strongly demands that this seat and the status of permanent member of the Security Council that comes with it be given to the People's Republic of China."
