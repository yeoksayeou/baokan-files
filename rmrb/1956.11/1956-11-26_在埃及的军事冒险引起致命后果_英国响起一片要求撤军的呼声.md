Xinhua News Agency, November 25th dispatch from London: Some British newspapers today strongly demanded the immediate withdrawal of British troops from Egypt, according to TASS.

    The "Reynolds News" published an editorial entitled "Leave Port Said," pointing out the fatal consequences of Britain's military adventure in Egypt and questioning the British government: "What policies does it intend to implement to combat unemployment, underemployment, and rising prices? These phenomena are bound to occur this winter because the war against Egypt has caused an oil shortage."

    The "Observer" warned that if Britain disobeyed the United Nations General Assembly resolution and did not withdraw its troops from Egypt, it would have a very bad impact on its position. The "Observer," referring to world opinion's demand for Britain to immediately fulfill the UN resolution, wrote: "The more we delay, the stronger the demand for us to leave will be… The only sensible course is to implement the UN's demands… We urge the government to pursue this course."

    The "People" attempted to defend Britain's intervention in Egypt with "noble motives," but also admitted that the matter had caused resentment against Britain in the Commonwealth, Europe, and the Near East countries.

    Prior to this, some British weeklies also advocated that Britain and France withdraw their troops from Egyptian territory.

    The "New Statesman and Nation" believes that although the most hawkish Conservatives are demanding that the interventionist forces not be withdrawn from the Suez Canal Zone, the British government now "has no choice but to withdraw from Egypt." The "Truth" weekly held the same view.

    The "Economist" magazine, when discussing the Anglo-French-Israeli aggression against Egypt, doubted whether Britain could compensate for "the damage to its international standing caused by the Middle East events of the past four weeks." The magazine said that the withdrawal of British troops from Egypt was inevitable, but the withdrawal "will not eliminate the great mistake of sending troops there." The magazine pointed out that some people in the Conservative Party "still have illusions of making new efforts to win," and said, "The situation is too unfavorable for that."

    Xinhua News Agency, November 25th dispatch from London: British Labour Party leader Hugh Gaitskell, at a Labour Party rally in Chester Street on November 24th, demanded that the British government no longer ignore the United Nations resolution and withdraw its troops from Egypt. Gaitskell said that the British and French governments, by not implementing the United Nations resolution, "are hindering the economic recovery we so badly need and are in fact threatening our country's economic prosperity."

    Xinhua News Agency, November 25th dispatch from London, November 24th TASS dispatch: The British National Peace Council issued a statement demanding that the British government immediately implement the United Nations General Assembly resolution on the withdrawal of British, French, and Israeli troops from Egypt. The statement said that if the British government did not do so, the prestige of the United Nations would be lost, and the risk of escalating the conflict in the Near East would be intensified.

    在埃及的军事冒险引起致命后果
    英国响起一片要求撤军的呼声
    新华社25日讯　据塔斯社伦敦讯：一些英国报纸今天坚决要求立即把英军撤出埃及。
    “雷诺新闻”发表了题为“离开塞得港”的社论，指出了英国在埃及的军事冒险的致命后果，并质问英国政府道：“为了同失业、开工不足和物价上涨作斗争，它打算实行什么政策呢？这些现象在今年冬天必然会发生，因为反对埃及的战争引起了石油荒。”
    “观察家报”警告：如果英国不服从联合国大会的决议，不从埃及撤军，这会对它的地位起很坏的影响。“观察家报”谈到世界舆论要英国立即履行联合国决议的要求时写道：“我们越拖延，要我们离开的要求就会越强……唯一明智的方针是执行联合国的要求……我们要求政府奉行这一方针”。
    “人民报”企图用“高尚的动机”来为英国干涉埃及作辩护，然而也承认，由于这件事，在英联邦、欧洲和近东各国引起了对英国的恶感。
    在这之前，英国一些周刊也主张英国和法国把军队撤出埃及领土。
    “新政治家与民族”周刊认为，虽然最好战的保守党人要求不把干涉军撤出苏伊士运河区，可是英国政府现在“没有办法，只有从埃及撤军”。“真理”周刊也有同样看法。
    “经济学家”杂志谈到英法以色列对埃及的侵略的时候，怀疑英国能不能补偿“近四星期来的中东事件给它的国际地位造成的损失”。杂志说，英国军队撤出埃及是不可避免的，但是撤军“不会消除派军队到那里去的这种大错误”。杂志指出保守党中有人“还有幻想作新的努力来获胜”，杂志说，“局势对这一点是太不利了”。
    新华社25日讯　伦敦消息：英国工党领袖盖次克尔11月24日在彻斯特街工党集会上，要求英国政府不要再无视联合国的决议不从埃及撤军。盖次克尔说，英法政府由于不执行联合国的决议，“在阻碍着我们如此需要的经济恢复，并且事实上使我国的经济繁荣受到威胁”。
    新华社25日讯　据塔斯社伦敦24日讯：英国全国和平理事会发表了一项声明，要求英国政府立刻执行联合国大会关于英国、法国和以色列军队撤出埃及的决议。声明说，如果英国政府不这样做，联合国的威信就将丧失，近东冲突地区扩大的危险性将加剧。
