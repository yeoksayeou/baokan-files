    Record of Raising Ducks
    By Our Correspondent Yu Ming
    Feidong County, Anhui Province, is a place where people have traditionally raised ducks. Every year, after harvesting the mid-season rice, farmers pack their bags and umbrellas, and in groups, drive large numbers of ducklings on their way. They leave home for three or two months. Some take the ducks to Quanjiao and Chuzhou, hundreds of miles away from home, all the way to the banks of the Yangtze River; others take the ducks north to Dingyuan and Jiashan counties. The ducks walk and feed along the way, growing from small to large, from thin to fat, and are then transported from Pukou and Mingguang stations to Nanjing, becoming good raw materials for Nanjing-made salted ducks. This year, the Qunsheng Agricultural Cooperative has collectively raised 30,000 ducks, in addition to those raised by the members themselves.
    One afternoon, the cooperative director Zhao Qinghua said, "Let me take you to see our hatchery!" He led me to the door of a thatched house behind the office. An old man greeted us. Zhao Qinghua introduced him as Yin Heman, the experienced master of duck incubating, with forty years of experience. The old man smiled and nodded, and led us into the hatchery.
    In the north and south rooms, there were many incubating jars placed against the walls on both sides. Large wooden boards were placed halfway up. Two fist-sized holes were dug in the east wall, and light shone in from the east, like two bright eyes. Yin Heman lifted the lid of an incubating jar, which was full of duck eggs. He casually took out a few and shone them in the hole in the east wall, saying that the little duck in this egg had already grown feathers, and that egg should be moved to the rack. When he showed me the eggs, I couldn't tell anything, I only saw a black blur inside, all the same.
    Yin Heman took me to the large wooden board. There were large quilts covering the board, and the quilts were constantly moving. When I lifted the quilt, it was a truly amazing sight! Some eggs had just revealed a small flat beak; some ducklings had climbed out halfway, struggling to pull out the other half of their bodies. In addition, some duck eggs were rolling; some ducklings had completely come out of their shells and were crawling on the board with a limp. Yin Heman said happily, "Six thousand ducks here will all come out today." To have six thousand lives born in one day! I felt the wisdom of man, and the superb skills of this old man.
    Cooperative director Zhao Qinghua looked at Yin Heman with grateful eyes and said, "Master Yin's skills are good, and he is responsible, so that more than ninety out of one hundred duck eggs can hatch into ducks, while generally only sixty to seventy can hatch." Then he started to calculate the accounts of raising ducks. He said, "Raising a thousand ducks, and selling them when they grow up, can bring a net profit of six or seven hundred yuan, which is equal to planting thirty mu of high-yielding rice. Raising ducks is a big deal in our area!"
    We walked out of the hatchery, and a duck herder was standing at the door. His name was Xia Dexian, and he had just returned from selling a flock of ducks in Hefei. So we all sat at the door and talked about raising ducks.
    Master Yin started by talking about incubating ducks.
      "When a woman gives birth, the midwife only needs a little effort, and only one child is born. But when incubating ducks, we have to deliver six thousand at once, and from spring to autumn this year, we have already delivered more than 110,000 ducks."
      "Once the duck eggs are put into the incubating jar, I have to stay beside it like a midwife guarding a woman in labor, and I can't leave for a moment. The lives of tens of thousands of ducks in the jars and on the racks are in my hands, and the cooperative's property is in my hands. How great is this responsibility!"
    "There are several batches of duck eggs in the incubating jar, and each batch requires a different temperature. If the temperature is too high, the ducks will suffocate in the egg; if the temperature is too low, the ducks will not be able to come out. It's hard to control!"
    "How do you manage to control it?" I asked.
    "How do I control it? I put the duck eggs on the corner of my eye to test the temperature. I test batch after batch, and then observe the incubation situation in the holes. Then I turn the eggs one by one. Tens of thousands of duck eggs have to be turned constantly every day. In the summer, people go to cool places, but the person incubating the ducks can only turn around the hot incubating jar. If you indulge in a moment of comfort, those eggs may be ruined."
    "Duck eggs take a full fourteen days from entering the jar to going on the rack, and then another fourteen days from leaving the jar to incubating on the rack. If it's cold on the rack, we have to add cotton wadding at any time. If it's hot, we have to fan the duck eggs constantly!"
    "A batch of ducks must all be incubated in twenty-eight days. If they come out early, their bodies are weak and they are prone to illness; if they come out late, they are not easy to sell. Ducks that are well incubated have abundant feathers and fat bodies, save feed and lay more eggs; those that are not well incubated cannot be fed well later. From spring to autumn, I haven't had a good night's sleep once."
    When Yin Heman said this, I asked Xia Dexian to talk about herding ducks. Xia Dexian said:
    "People say that ducks are 'anxious bugs'. From incubation to raising, until they are sold, then you can be free from anxiety." "Didn't you see those clay kiln-like sheds along the river and ditches? Those are duck sheds. When the ducklings first arrive at the duck shed, we duck herders can't sleep well for seven days and seven nights. If the ducklings feel cold, they pile together, a pile a foot high. If it exceeds an hour, the ducks at the bottom will die of heat. If you don't do it well, a large pile will die. We have to boom next to them all day and all night, and if we are sleepy, we can only take a nap.
    "Ducklings are extremely delicate. If they are not fed well when they are small, they will not grow meat when they are big. As soon as the chickens crow, we have to catch insects and fish and shrimp for them to eat, because without these, they won't even eat steamed rice! If you force them to eat, it may damage their appetite once or twice, and then it will be even more difficult to deal with. They want to live by the water, but the shed can't be damp at all, and you have to change the grass mat for them frequently.
     "When the ducks grow up, they have to be herded far away, hundreds of miles away, and people have to run after the ducks day and night. Wherever the ducks stop at night, you have to sleep there. For duck herders, an umbrella is a house. In summer, they sleep on ants, cover themselves with mosquitoes, and sleep on pond embankments; in winter, they also have to sleep in the wild, pad ice and snow, and cover themselves with wind and frost. Ducks are also a special thing. The heavier the rain, the happier they are. At this time, all the insects come out, and they run faster and farther, and you have to follow them everywhere in the rain." "When old ducks are about to lay eggs, they need even better service. At this time, their nature needs to be free. If you don't follow them, they won't lay eggs, or they will lay fewer eggs. If they want to walk, let them walk; if they want to stand, let them stand; if they want to eat meat, you can't give them vegetarian food; if they want to eat vegetarian food, you can't give them meat. It's hard to figure out their minds!
    "A well-herded flock of ducks can lay one hundred eggs a day for every one hundred ducks. If they are not well-herded, they can only lay fifty or sixty eggs a day. If they are well-herded, ducks that are more than two months old can sell for one yuan and forty-five cents each. If they are not well-herded, they can't sell for that much even after three months!"
    At this point, Yin Heman went to the hatchery to check the incubating jars, and Xia Dexian also went back to eat dinner. I saw several strong horses on the high embankment, being led to the stable by a person. That was the cooperative's breeder, respectfully called the "horse breeding master" by the people; at this time, the people making flour in the flour mill, and weaving bamboo in the bamboo utensil room... all came out to eat. These people are all considered by the members to have "a skill", they are all experts in the eyes of the peasants! I thought to myself: in not many years, these experts will increase, and then the chickens and ducks in the cooperative will grow bigger and fatter, the cattle and horses will be raised more and stronger, and people's lives will be better.

    记养鸭
    本报记者　于明
    安徽省肥东县是一个素来就有养鸭子习惯的地方。农民每年在收割中稻后，就背起行囊和雨伞，搭伙赶着大批小鸭子出发。一去三月、两月不沾家。有的把鸭子放到离家几百里外的全椒、滁县，一直到长江的岸边；有的把鸭子顺北路放到定远和嘉山县。鸭子沿途边走边食，由小到大，由瘦长肥，就从浦口和明光车站运送到南京，成了南京制造板鸭的好原料。今年，群生农业社，除了社员自养的以外，集体喂养的鸭子就有三万只。
    一天下午，社主任赵庆华说：“带你去看看我们的孵房吧！”他领我到办公室后面的一幢草房门口，一个老年人迎着我们，赵庆华介绍说，他就是孵房的老师傅尹和满，已经有四十年炕鸭子的经验了。老年人笑着点点头，引我们进了孵房。
    南北房里两边靠墙的地方，安着许多炕鸭子的缸，半空架着很大的木板，东墙根上挖了两个拳头大的洞，光线从东面射进来，像是两只炯炯发光的眼睛。尹和满揭起炕缸的盖子，里面满是鸭蛋。他随手拿几个出来，在东墙根的洞口照照，就说这个蛋里的小鸭已经长毛了，那个蛋已经该移上架子了。他把蛋给我看时，我却什么也分辨不出来，只见里面黑糊糊一片，个个都是一样。
    尹和满带我到架着的大木板上去。这里有大块被子盖着木板，那被子正在不停地动着。揭开被子一看，那真是奇妙的景象！有的蛋刚刚露出一个小扁嘴：有的小鸭子爬出半个身子，正在吃力地向外拔那半个身子。另外，有些鸭蛋在滚动着；有些小鸭已经完全走出蛋壳，在木板上一跛一跛地爬动了。尹和满高兴地说：“这里六千只鸭子，今天一天就都要出来了。”让六千个生命一天诞生！我感到人的智慧，感到这个老头儿技术的高强。
    社主任赵庆华用感激的眼光看着尹和满说：“尹师傅的技术好，又负责，使下缸的鸭蛋，一百个能出到九十多个鸭子，一般的只能出到六十到七十个。”他接着就算起养鸭子账来。他说：“养一千只鸭子，长大了卖出去，可净得利六、七百元，等于种三十亩高产的稻子。养鸭子，在我们这里可是件大事！”
    我们走出孵房，一个放鸭子师傅正站在门口，他的名字叫做夏德仙，是刚赶了一群鸭子到合肥卖掉回来的。我们就都坐在门口谈起养鸭子的事情来。
    尹师傅先说起炕鸭子来。
      “人要生孩子，接生婆只需一会儿工夫，而且出生的只是一个孩子。可是，鸭子一接就是六千个，今年春天到秋天，我们已经接了十一万多只鸭子了。”
      “鸭蛋一下炕缸，我就得像接生婆守在产妇旁边一样，一刻也不能离开了。缸里、架上几万个鸭子的生命在我手里，社里多少财产在我手里，这责任有多大！”
    “炕缸里鸭蛋有好几批，每一批所需要的热度都不一样。热度大，鸭子在蛋里闷死了；热度小，鸭子又出不来了。可是难掌握哩！”
    “你怎样设法掌握它呢？”我问。
    “怎样掌握？我把鸭蛋贴到眼角上试温度。一批一批的试，试了又在洞子上观察孵化的情况。然后再一个蛋一个蛋的翻弄，几万个鸭蛋，一天得不停的翻。夏天人们都往凉快地方走，炕鸭子的人却只能在热度很高的炕缸边转，你只要贪图一会儿舒服，那些蛋可能就要炕毁了。”
    “鸭蛋从入缸到上架整整十四天，出了缸到架上又得孵十四天，架上冷了，得随时加棉絮，热了，还得给鸭蛋不停地扇扇子！”
    “一批鸭子必须在二十八天头上都炕出来，出早，身体弱，容易得病；出晚，就不好卖了。炕得好的鸭子，毛丰体肥，省喂食、下蛋多；炕不好，以后喂都喂不好。从春到秋，我日夜都没有睡过一次大觉。”
    尹和满说到这里，我就要求夏德仙谈谈放鸭子。夏德仙说：
    “人们说，鸭子是‘焦心虫’，从孵到养，一直到卖出，才算不焦心了。”“你不是看到沿河沿沟那些土窑样的棚子了吗？那就是鸭棚，小鸭初到鸭棚，我们当放鸭师傅的人，七天七夜都不能好好睡觉。小鸭子觉冷了，它就往一起堆，一堆一尺高，超过一个钟头，堆到低下的鸭子热死了，搞不好一死一大堆。我们整天整夜得在旁边轰，瞌睡了只能打个盹。
    “小鸭子娇嫩透了。小时喂不好，大时根本不长肉。鸡一叫，我们就得给它打虫子和捞鱼虾吃，因为没有这些，它连蒸米都不吃！你要硬着它吃，一两次就可能把胃口弄坏，那就更难摆弄了。它要住在水边，可是棚子里一点都不能潮湿，你得经常为它换草铺。
     “鸭子大了，就要往远地放，一放几百里外，白天黑夜人得跟着鸭子跑。晚间鸭子停到那里，你就得睡到那里。放鸭子的人，一把伞就是房子，夏天睡觉是垫蚂蚁、盖蚊子、睡塘堰；冬天，也得睡到野外，垫冰雪，盖风霜。鸭子这种东西也特别，越下大雨，它越快活。这时虫子都出来了，它就跑得越快越远，你就得跟着它在雨里到处转。”“老鸭要生蛋了，就需要更好服侍。这时，它的性情要自由，不依着它，它就不生蛋，少生蛋。它要走就走，要站就站，要吃荤你不能给它吃素，要吃素不能给它吃荤。这个心思才难摸哩！
    “一个放得好的鸭群，一百个鸭子一天能生一百个蛋，放不好，一天只能生五六十个蛋；放好了，两个多月的鸭子每个就能卖一块四五，放不好，三个多月也卖不了那么多！”
    谈到这里，尹和满到孵房看炕缸去了，夏德仙也回去吃晚饭。我看到那高堤上有几匹健马，被一个人牵着跑向马棚，那是社里的一个饲养员，被人们尊称为“养马师傅”；这时粉房里制粉的，竹器房编竹器的……都出来吃饭了。这些人都是被社员们认为“有一手”本领的人，他们都是农民眼里的专家！我暗暗想着：不要多少年，这些专家就会多起来了，那时，社里的鸡鸭会长得更大更肥，牛马会养得更多更壮，人们生活会过得更美好。
