Xinhua News Agency, Yumen, November 22nd: Workers at the Yumen Oilfield Refinery have increased the nation's gasoline and kerosene production by more than 5,400 tons from January to October this year.

Workers in the refinery's first workshop, building on improvements in their technical skills, rationally altered the old temperature standards for the refining furnace tubes. As a result, the refining rate increased by more than 2%, not only increasing the production of large quantities of gasoline and kerosene, but also saving a lot of crude oil. Workers in the second workshop, by finding ways to extend the operating period of the refining furnace and improve operating methods, increased the production of nearly 700 tons of gasoline and kerosene in four months.

Xinhua News Agency, Yumen, November 23rd: As of the 20th of this month, the Yumen Mining Bureau Refinery has exceeded its annual profit remittance plan by 3%. From January to October, the plant's total production cost also decreased by 9.3% compared to the national plan. Currently, all employees of the plant are further developing the increase production and practice economy movement, striving to remit more than four million yuan in profits to the state by the end of this year.

Since the beginning of this year, all workshops at the Yumen Refinery have formulated plans to increase production and practice economy. The main production workshops have implemented a team-based economic accounting system and launched an increase production and practice economy competition between teams. During this period, all employees of the plant have also promoted more than ten advanced experiences related to improving refining rates, saving crude oil, and increasing the production of gasoline and kerosene. Among them, the workers in the first workshop alone, after implementing the suggestion of increasing the temperature of the refining furnace tubes and producing heavy diesel oil in the crude oil tower, increased the production of more than 700 tons of gasoline in the third quarter. From January to October, all workshops also saved 77,000 yuan in material costs.

    玉门油矿炼油厂职工
    十个月增产汽油煤油五千多吨
    新华社玉门22日电　玉门油矿炼油厂职工从今年1月到10月共为国家增产了五千四百多吨汽油和煤油。
    这个炼油厂第一车间的工人，在技术水平提高的基础上，合理地改变了旧的炼油炉管温度的标准，结果使炼油率比过去提高2％以上，不但增产了大批汽油和煤油，并且节省了许多原油。第二车间的工人由于设法延长炼炉的开炼期限和改进操作方法，在四个月内就增产将近七百吨汽油和煤油。
    新华社玉门23日电　到本月20日为止，玉门矿务局炼油厂已经超额3％完成了今年全年的上缴利润计划。从1月到10月，这个厂的生产总成本也比国家计划降低了9.3％。目前全厂职工正在进一步开展增产节约运动，争取到今年年底再向国家上缴四百多万元的利润。
    玉门炼油厂各车间从今年年初开始，就都订出增产节约的计划，主要生产车间推行了班组经济核算制度，同时开展班与班之间的增产节约竞赛。全厂职工在这期间，还推广了十多种有关提高炼油率，节约原油，增产汽油、煤油等的先进经验。其中仅第一车间的职工，在实行了提高炼油炉管温度和在原油塔里出重柴油的建议以后，第三季度内就增产了七百多吨汽油。各车间从1月到10月，还节约了材料费七万七千元。
