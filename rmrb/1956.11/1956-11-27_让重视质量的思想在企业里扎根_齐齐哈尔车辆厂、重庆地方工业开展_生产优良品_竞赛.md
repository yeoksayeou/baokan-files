Xinhua News Agency, Qiqihar, 26th: The Qiqihar Locomotive and Rolling Stock Manufacturing Plant's "Produce Excellent Products" competition has achieved results. In the past month, the plant's parts, machinery, and other processing workshops have eliminated defective products. The number of excellent products now accounts for 60% of the total output.

This factory was transformed from a repair shop into a manufacturing plant. The factory's technology is relatively backward, workers are accustomed to repair work, and discipline in implementing process regulations is also relatively poor. Therefore, some product components do not meet interchangeability requirements, and the scrap rate of cast steel parts is relatively high. In mid-October this year, the factory's Party Committee, in response to this situation, launched a competition among employees to produce excellent products. In the first seven days of the competition, employees throughout the plant put forward 102 rationalization proposals for improving product quality. The factory's tool management department also promptly identified and replaced inaccurate measuring tools and templates. Process technicians went deep into the workshops to help workers revise process regulations and improve process equipment. Many production teams have formulated measures to improve quality. The factory leadership also promptly rewarded Li Hengshi, an electrician, Pan Dewu, a foundry worker, and other advanced producers who consistently maintained excellent product quality, and organized professional and technical workers to learn from their advanced experiences. Now, the factory's employees have generally established the concept of valuing product quality and have also corrected the idea held by some employees that "if you want good product quality, you must spend more working hours."

Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 26th: In Chongqing, the number of local industrial products that meet national quality standards and advanced regional levels has increased to twenty-three, compared to only a few major products meeting national quality standards in July this year.

Since the fourth quarter of this year, as local industrial factories have further carried out inter-factory and inter-workshop competitions, and the "Produce Excellent Products" movement, many factory employees have actively promoted advanced experiences. The Chongqing Automobile Parts Factory's automobile master pump cylinder block did not meet the standard for smoothness, which affected its service life and driving safety, and many users requested returns. The factory specifically established a research team to dissect and analyze the smoothness of Soviet products and identify the reasons for the poor smoothness of the master pump cylinder block. After several months of efforts by technicians and workers, nine advanced experiences and technical measures were promoted. Recently, the smoothness of the master pump cylinder block has been increased from level six to level eight, and product sales have increased.

The Chongqing Thermos Bottle Factory, Beibei Glass Factory, and various battery factories have learned from each other's production experiences, drawing on each other's strengths and overcoming weaknesses, which has also improved product quality.

Leading cadres of the China Wool Textile Factory personally worked with employees to improve the dyeing process. After strictly implementing the inspection system, the quality of six out of eight major products in early November was improved compared to October. Three major categories of products, worsted fabrics, wool yarn, and blankets, all reached the national first-class product quality standards.

    让重视质量的思想在企业里扎根
    齐齐哈尔车辆厂、重庆地方工业开展“生产优良品”竞赛
    据新华社齐齐哈尔26日电　齐齐哈尔机车车辆制造厂开始生产优良品竞赛获得成绩。一个月来，这个工厂的配件、机械等加工车间已经消灭了废品。现在工厂生产的优良品数量已经占到总产量的60％。
    这个工厂是由修配工厂转变为制造工厂的。工厂工艺比较落后，工人习惯于修配，执行工艺规程的纪律也比较差。因此有些产品部件达不到互换的要求，铸钢件废品率较高。今年10月中旬，厂里的中共党委会针对这种情况，发动职工展开了生产优良品的竞赛。全厂职工在竞赛开始的头七天里，就提出了一百零二项改进产品质量的合理化建议。工厂工具管理部门也及时地鉴定和更换了不准确的量具和样板。工艺技术人员都深入车间帮助工人修订工艺规程和改进工艺装备。许多生产小组都订出了提高质量的措施。工厂领导方面也及时地奖励了电焊工李恒石、铸工潘德务等十二个一贯保持产品质量优良的先进生产者，并且组织专业技术工人学习他们的先进经验。现在，这个工厂的职工普遍树立起重视产品质量的观念。也纠正了有些职工曾认为“若要产品质量好，必须工时花的多”的思想。
    据新华社重庆26日电　重庆市不少地方工业产品在今年7月份只有几种主要产品达到国家规定的质量标准，现在达到国家规定的质量标准和先进地区水平的产品已经增加到二十三种。
    今年第四季度以来，各地方工业工厂在进一步开展厂同厂、车间同车间的同业务竞赛和生产优良产品的运动中，许多厂的职工积极推广了先进经验。重庆汽车配件厂的汽车主泵缸体因为光洁度不够标准，影响使用寿命和行车安全，不少用户要求退货。这个厂专门成立研究小组，解剖分析苏联产品的光洁度，找出了主泵缸体光洁度不好的原因。经过技术人员和工人几个月的努力，推广了九项先进经验和技术措施，最近主泵缸体的光洁度由六级提高到八级，产品销路增加。
    重庆热水瓶厂、北碚玻璃厂和各个电池厂等相互学习生产经验，彼此取长补短，也提高了产品质量。
    中国毛纺织厂的领导干部亲自动手同职工一起改善染色工序，严格检验制度以后，十一月上旬八种主要产品中有六种产品质量比10月份有了提高，精纺织品、毛线、毛毯三大类产品都达到国家规定的一等品质量标准。
