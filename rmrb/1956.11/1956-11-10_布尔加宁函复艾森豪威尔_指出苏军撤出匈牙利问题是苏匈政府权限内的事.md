Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 9th: TASS reported from Moscow on November 8th: Soviet Council of Ministers Chairman Bulganin received a letter on November 5th from U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Bohlen, which was from U.S. President Eisenhower, addressing the situation in Hungary. On November 7th, Bulganin sent a reply letter to Eisenhower.

In his letter of November 4th, Eisenhower stated that he was "deeply saddened by the news from Hungary" that day. The letter also stated, "After the Soviet government issued a declaration on October 30th reaffirming its policy of non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries, it was generally believed that this was a promise that Soviet troops would soon withdraw from Hungary." Eisenhower said, "The United States government and I personally considered this statement to be a highly politically wise move. The Hungarian government subsequently made a definite request for the withdrawal of Soviet troops. Therefore, this apparent change of policy has deeply shocked us." Eisenhower said, "For the sake of humanity and for the sake of peace, I insist that the Soviet Union take steps to immediately withdraw Soviet troops from Hungary and allow the Hungarian people to exercise and enjoy the human rights and fundamental freedoms that the peoples of all countries are entitled to under the United Nations Charter."

In his reply letter to Eisenhower, Bulganin said: "Regarding your letter of November 4th, I consider it necessary to point out that the question raised in the letter regarding the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Hungary is entirely within the authority of the Hungarian government and the Soviet government. At the same time, I would also like to point out that you have probably already had the opportunity to see the government program put forward by the Hungarian Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government in its "Appeal to the Hungarian People." I have no doubt that you have noticed that this program fully explains the issues you are concerned about.

Your letter mentions the declaration issued by the Soviet government on October 30, 1956, regarding the foundations of developing and further strengthening the friendship and cooperation between the Soviet Union and other socialist countries. There is no basis to doubt that the Soviet government now follows and will continue to follow in its policies the principles stated in the declaration."

    布尔加宁函复艾森豪威尔
    指出苏军撤出匈牙利问题是苏匈政府权限内的事
    新华社9日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科8日讯：苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁在11月5日收到美国驻苏联大使波伦转来美国总统艾森豪威尔的谈到匈牙利局势的一封信。11月7日，布尔加宁给了艾森豪威尔一封回信。
    艾森豪威尔在他的11月4日的信中说，他这天“得悉匈牙利的消息，感到非常沉痛”。信中又说，“苏联政府在10月30日发表了重申不干涉他国内政的政策的宣言之后，人们曾经普遍认为这是苏军即将撤离匈牙利的诺言”。艾森豪威尔说，“美国政府和我个人认为这项声明是高度的政治明智的举动。匈牙利政府在这以后提出了要苏军撤退的肯定要求。因此，这项政策的显然改变使我们深为震惊”。艾森豪威尔说，“为了人道，为了和平，我坚持要求苏联采取步骤立即从匈牙利撤出苏联军队，让匈牙利人民运用和行使联合国宪章确认各国人民所享有的人权和基本自由”。
    布尔加宁在给艾森豪威尔的回信中说：“对于你11月4日的来信，我认为有必要指出，信中所提出的关于苏联军队撤出匈牙利的问题，完全是匈牙利政府和苏联政府权限以内的事。同时我还愿意指出，你大概已经有可能看到匈牙利工农革命政府在“告匈牙利人民书”中所提出的政府纲领。我不怀疑，你已经注意到，这个纲领对你所关心的问题有充分的说明。
    你的信中谈到苏联政府在1956年10月30日发表的关于发展和进一步加强苏联同其他社会主义国家的友谊和合作的基础的宣言，没有任何根据怀疑，苏联政府在自己的政策中现在遵循，将来也要遵循宣言中所陈述的原则。”
