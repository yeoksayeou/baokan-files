    U.S. Military Officers Stationed in Japan Involved in Graft and Bribery
    "Japan News" revealed on the 24th the serious graft and bribery activities of U.S. military officers stationed in Japan.
    The newspaper said that Japanese companies almost always give gifts when doing business with the U.S. military. "Some people often receive gifts worth millions of yen, and this is the result of the bribed individuals' insistence. Among these people are officers and generals."

    Child Abuse in Britain
    In Britain, although there is an organization dedicated to preventing child abuse, cases of child abuse are still increasing. According to the organization's statistics alone, in the twelve months before February of this year, the organization handled 3,624 cases of child abuse, an increase of 66 cases compared to the previous year. The organization also cited many examples to illustrate the seriousness of child abuse. A father punched his seven-month-old daughter and killed her because she cried desperately, and threw her to the ground. A mother put her four-month-old child in boiling water because "everything irritated her nerves." Some parents broke their children's noses or almost twisted off their ears, and so on.

    Striptease Popular in Paris
    According to the French "International Forum": A kind of "striptease," that is, nude dance, is currently popular on the stage in Paris.
    The reason for this situation is due to the decrease in revenue in the theatrical industry. According to the analysis of "International Forum," the reason for the decrease in revenue is partly due to the competition from other forms of entertainment, but more importantly because most residents are too poor and cannot afford tickets. Since there are so few viewers, theaters have to use "novelty" to attract audiences. Thus, all kinds of "striptease" have become popular, which has plunged the French theatrical industry into the crisis that "International Forum" spoke of.

    Gambling in Court
    According to the British "Times," a judge in Florida, USA, used a whimsical method when sentencing two dice-rolling gamblers to pay fines. He announced in court that the base fine for each gambler was ten U.S. dollars. In addition, each person would roll dice in court once, and the fine would be increased according to the number of points rolled. As a result, the two gamblers rolled up their sleeves in court and showed off their skills. One gambler rolled seven points and was fined seventeen dollars. The other gambler rolled five points and was fined fifteen dollars.

    驻日美国军官贪污受贿
    “日本新闻”24日揭露了驻日美军军官们严重的贪污和勒索贿赂的行为。
    这家报纸说，日本的公司几乎每次同美军做一桩生意都要送礼。“有些人常常收到数百万日元的礼物，而且这都是受贿人坚持索要的结果。这些人中间有校官和将军。”
    虐待儿童在英国
    在英国，虽然有一个专门防止虐待儿童的组织，可是虐待儿童的案件仍然有增无已。仅据这一组织的统计，在今年2月以前的十二个月里，这个组织就处理了三千六百二十四宗虐待儿童案，比上年度增加六十六宗。这个组织还列举了很多例子借以说明虐待儿童的严重性。一个父亲因为出世才七个月的女儿拚命哭就用拳打她，并把她摔死。一个母亲把四个月的小孩放进沸水里烫，因为“事事刺激她的神经”。还有些父母把孩子打塌了鼻子或差不多扭下耳朵等等。
    巴黎盛行脱衣舞
    据法国“国际论坛”说：目前在巴黎舞台上盛行着一种“脱衣舞”，所谓“脱衣舞”者也就是裸体舞蹈。
    这种情况之所以造成是由于戏剧业的收入减少。据“国际论坛”分析，收入所以减少一方面是由于其他娱乐方式的竞争，但更重要的是由于大多数居民太贫困了，他们买不起票。既然观众是这样的少，戏院就不能不用“新奇”来吸引观众。这样，各种各样的“脱衣舞”就盛行起来了，从而使得法国的戏剧业陷入了“国际论坛”所说的危机之中。
    法庭的赌博
    据英国“泰晤士报”报道，美国佛罗利达州一位法官在判决两名掷骰子的赌徒罚款数额的时候，使用了一个异想天开的办法。他在法庭上宣布说：每名赌徒罚款基数是美金十元，此外，各人当庭掷骰子一次，根据所掷点数加判罚金。结果，两名赌徒当庭卷起袖子，各显身手。一名赌徒掷出了七点，被罚款十七元。另一名赌徒掷出了五点，被罚款十五元。
