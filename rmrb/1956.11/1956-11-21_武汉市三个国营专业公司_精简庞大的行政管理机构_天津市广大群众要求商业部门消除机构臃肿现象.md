Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, November 19th: The three state-owned specialized companies in Wuhan City—retail, catering, and life services—are streamlining their large administrative organizations. Over 52% of administrative personnel are being gradually reassigned to grassroots stores to engage in business work or transferred to other positions where they are needed.

These three specialized companies have a total of over 1,100 administrative personnel, with administrative organizations at the city and district company levels, as well as district management offices. The massive organizational structure and excessive personnel led to extremely low work efficiency and wasted a large amount of manpower and material resources. Many people only worked two hours a day. The companies took on many tasks that they shouldn't have, such as barber shops needing to buy a few towels or hair clips, and even workers' leave requests had to be approved by the district management office. The transportation costs for seeking approval, especially for more distant stores, were often enough to purchase some small items, and the time wasted was incalculable. The retail company also centralized purchasing, transportation, storage, and economic accounting at the district company level, which caused many inconveniences and losses to business operations. It increased commodity circulation links and expenses, often leading to mismatched commodities, resulting in artificial stockpiling and out-of-stock situations, failing to meet consumer needs.

Such a large administrative organization greatly affected the enthusiasm of grassroots stores. Many grassroots store directors and salespersons described their work as "having the title but no power," because grassroots stores only had the right to sell goods. They only cared about sales plans and did not care about other plans such as purchasing, expenses, or profits, and could not effectively and timely meet consumer needs.

Due to the massive organization, multiple leadership layers, overstaffing, and bureaucracy in leadership, the arbitrary formulation of systems and regulations, and the excessive issuance of reports followed. The retail company issued more than fifty kinds of reports, which were repetitive and complex. One commodity circulation expense report required filling in 200 monetary figures, 400 indicators, and calculating 198 percentages, resulting in a large waste of manpower and material resources.

In response to these existing problems, the three specialized companies reformed the management system based on the principles of streamlining administration and strengthening business. They delegated matters and powers that administrative organizations should not and did not need to manage to the grassroots stores, making larger stores independently responsible for all economic activities of their units, and reduced and simplified reports. As a result, the workload of city and district companies and management offices was greatly reduced. According to detailed calculations, only a small fraction of the original administrative personnel was needed. The secretarial section of the life services company, which previously had 19 people and still complained of being understaffed, was reduced to 15 people, who were not only fully capable of handling the work but also able to take on the company's infrastructure repair tasks, eliminating the organizational technology section that previously handled this work. After some grassroots stores of the retail company implemented independent economic accounting, procurement was accelerated, and the variety of goods managed increased.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, November 19th: The Tianjin Daily published two readers' letters on the 18th, exposing the serious phenomenon of bloated management organizations and overstaffing of administrative personnel in Tianjin's commercial departments.

Jin Changgeng of the Tianjin Purchasing and Supply Station of the China Pharmaceutical Company said in his letter to the Tianjin Daily that cadres in some departments of their station were often idle. In June of this year, the Tianjin Municipal First Commercial Bureau instructed their station to establish an organizational technology section. To this day, the leaders of the bureau and station have not specifically assigned what this section should do. The cadres felt uncomfortable and had no choice but to read newspapers, study, and chat. One cadre only handled two matters in half a year. People in the section have repeatedly requested work from the leadership, but the answers they received were always "Wait a bit!" "We'll study it in a few days and tell you!"

Sun Baoyuan, a salesperson at the Fourth Outlet of the Jinzhong Road Branch of the Joint State-Private Fruit and Vegetable Wholesale Store, wrote: Since the implementation of joint state-private operation, business procedures have become more cumbersome, and the number of operational links has increased. In order to report business conditions to the main store and branch store every day, each outlet has established several business groups and a settlement group, with an accounting group within each business group. Of the 734 people belonging to the ten outlets of the Jinzhong Road Branch, only about half were doing business. The outlets were too busy, while some administrative personnel in the main store and branch store could not find things to do.

In the past ten days or so, the Tianjin Daily has exposed many serious cases of bloated organizations in commercial departments. The Tianjin Purchasing and Supply Station of the China Chemical Raw Materials Company had no more than 500 employees at its peak business volume two years ago. Now, the business volume has decreased by 8%, but the number of personnel has increased to more than 600. The Tianjin Hardware and Machinery Company now has more than 1,000 people, with business personnel accounting for less than 40% and administrative management personnel accounting for more than 60%. In the manager's office alone, there are six cadres, including a director, secretary, and report writer, "assisting" the leading comrades in their work.

The broad masses of Tianjin are demanding that commercial departments resolutely streamline management organizations and overcome bureaucracy. Some companies are already formulating plans and preparing to take swift action.

    武汉市三个国营专业公司
    精简庞大的行政管理机构
    天津市广大群众要求商业部门消除机构臃肿现象
    新华社武汉19日电　武汉市零售、饮食、生活服务三个国营专业公司精简庞大的行政管理机构，52％以上的行政人员正在陆续被充实到基层商店搞业务工作，或调往其他需要的工作岗位。
    这三个专业公司共拥有行政人员一千一百多人，设有市、区公司和区管理处等各级管理机构。庞大的组织机构和过多的人员，工作效率极低，浪费了大批人力物力，有不少人每天只有两小时的工作。公司包揽了许多不应管的工作，如理发店要买几条毛巾、几个发夹等营业用品，甚至工人请假，都得经过区管理处的批准，有些较远的商店仅来回请示批准所用的车费，也足够添置一些小的用具了，往返花费的时间更是无法计算。零售公司还把采购、运输、储存、经济核算等工作都集中在区公司，给营业带来很多不便和损失，增多了商品流转环节和费用，常常发生商品不对路，造成人为的积压和脱销，不能满足消费者的需要。
    这样庞大的行政管理机构，大大影响了基层商店的积极性。许多基层商店主任、营业员形容他们的工作是“有职无权”，因为基层商店只有售货的权利，他们就只关心销售计划，对其他采购、费用、利润等计划都不关心，也无法及时有效的满足消费者的需要。
    由于机构庞大、领导多头、人浮于事和领导上的官僚主义，滥订制度、规章，滥发报表的事情就跟着发生，零售公司发下的报表有五十多种，而且内容重复、复杂，有一种商品流转费用表，需要填写二百笔金额数字、四百个指标和计算一百九十八个百分比，造成很大的人力物力上的浪费。
    针对这些存在的问题，三个专业公司本着精简行政、充实业务的原则，改革了管理制度，把行政机构不应管和不需要管的事务和权力都下放到基层商店；让较大的商店对本单位的全部经济活动独立负责；并且减少和简化了报表。这样一来，市、区公司和管理处的工作负担大大减轻，根据算细帐的结果，只要原有行政人员数的一小半就够了。生活服务公司的秘书科原有十九人还吵人手不够，现在减为十五人，不但完全能担负工作，还可把公司的基建修缮任务兼管起来，取消了过去管这个工作的组织技术科。零售公司一部分基层商店实行经济独立核算后，进货加快，经营的品种也增多了。
    新华社天津19日电　天津日报18日发表两件读者来信，揭发天津市商业部门管理机构臃肿、行政人员人浮于事的严重现象。
    中国医药公司天津采购供应站靳长庚给天津日报的信上说，他们站有的科室的干部常常闲着无事。今年6月，天津市第一商业局责成他们站成立一个组织技术科，这个科到底应该干些什么工作，直到现在局和站的领导方面没有具体布置过。干部呆得难受，只好看看报、读读书、聊聊天，有一个干部半年只办理过两件事情。科里的人曾经不断地向领导方面要求工作做，但是得到的回答总是“等一等吧！”“再过些天研究好了，告诉你们吧！”
    公私合营瓜果批发总店金钟路分店第四门市部的业务员孙宝元写道：自从实行公私合营以后，作生意的手续麻烦了，经营的环节增多了，各门市部为了每天向总店和分店汇报业务情况，都成立了几个业务组和一个结算组，每个业务组内还设一个会计组。金钟路分店所属十个门市部的七百三十四人中，做买卖的人只有一半左右。门市部的业务忙不过来，而总店和分店的有些行政人员却找不到事情做。
    最近十多天来，“天津日报”已经揭发了商业部门很多机构臃肿的严重情况。中国化工原料公司天津采购供应站在两年前业务量最多的时候，全站职工不过五百人，现在业务量减少了百分之八，而人员却增加到了六百多，天津市五金机械公司现在有一千多人，业务人员不到百分之四十，行政管理人员却占百分之六十以上，单是在经理办公室“辅助”领导同志工作的，就有主任、秘书和写总结报告的干部六人。
    天津市广大群众正要求商业部门坚决精简管理机构，克服官僚主义。有些公司已经在制定方案，准备迅速行动。
