Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, November 8th: The Polish Press Agency reports that the tenth session of the Polish Parliament reconvened in Warsaw on November 7th. The Chairman of the Polish State Economic Planning Commission, Jędrzejowski, presented a report on the draft of the Five-Year Plan for 1956 to 1960.

Jędrzejowski said that the draft stipulates that the total value of socialist industrial output will increase by 53.2%. This growth rate is much slower than the 118% actually achieved in the past five years (1951 to 1955). However, due to the much higher base now, this growth rate is still a very significant increase. In absolute terms, the annual increase in production will be no less than the amount during the Six-Year Plan.

In the past few months, after analyzing the relationship between the scale of production and the scale of basic investment in the Five-Year Plan, the funding for basic investment has been reduced twice, and the amount of industrial production growth has also been reduced accordingly.

The internal structure of basic investment has undergone significant changes compared to the past five years. Industrial investment has decreased from 46.8% of total investment to 43.4%, agricultural investment has increased from 7.6% to 11.9%, and housing construction funding has increased from 11.6% to 14.4%.

The draft plan stipulates that during the Five-Year Plan period, the production of means of production will increase by 57.3%, and the production of consumer goods will increase by 48.7%. The increase in consumer goods production, coupled with the increase in agricultural output, is sufficient to achieve the plan's goal of increasing the real wages and real income of workers and peasants by 30%.

The draft stipulates that coal production will increase by 15.5 million tons in the next five years, 24% less than during the Six-Year Plan. However, the output per working day will increase from 283,000 tons in 1955 to 360,000 tons in 1960.

The draft plan stipulates that steel production will increase by 63%, bringing the annual output in 1960 to 7.2 million tons. The output of the machine-building industry in 1960 will be double that of 1955.

Jędrzejowski said that the Parliament's discussion of the Five-Year Plan draft comes at a time when Poland is carrying out tremendous reforms in the system of planning and managing the national economy, and also at a time when worker self-government organizations are being established in production enterprises and measures are being taken to grant enterprises autonomy and expand the scope of the law of value in our country's economy. These changes, which tend toward decentralized management and democratization, will have a huge impact on the preparation of the Five-Year Plan.

Subsequently, Member of Parliament Langer presented the report of the Parliamentary Finance and Budget Committee on the draft of the Five-Year Plan. The report believes that the Five-Year Plan bill should be submitted to the next Parliament for approval, and this Parliament can adopt this plan draft as a guide to action and as a basis for formulating the 1957 plan.

    波议会听取新五年计划报告
    对工农业投资比率较前有显著的变化
    工业生产总值将增加百分之五十三多
    新华社华沙8日电　波兰通讯社报道：波兰议会第十次会议11月7日在华沙复会。波兰国家经济计划委员会主席英德里霍夫斯基在会上报告了1956年到1960年五年计划草案。
    英德里霍夫斯基说，这个草案规定社会主义工业生产总值将增加53.2％。这个增长速度比过去五年（1951年到1955年）实际达到的118％是慢得多了。但是，由于现在的基数高得多，所以这个增长速度还是一个很显著的增长。在绝对数量上，每年生产量的增加将不小于六年计划期间的数量。
    在过去几个月里，在对五年计划中生产规模同基本投资规模之间的相互关系进行分析以后，已经对基本投资的经费削减了两次，并且也随之削减了工业生产增长的数量。
    基本投资的内部结构同过去五年比较起来已经发生了显著的变化。工业投资已经从总投资的46.8％减少到43.4％，农业投资从7.6％增加到11.9％，住房建筑的经费从11.6％增加到14.4％。
    计划草案规定，在五年计划期间生产资料的生产将增加57.3％，消费资料的生产将增加48.7。消费资料生产的增加再加上农业产量的增加，足以实现计划中所规定的使工人和农民的实际工资和实际收入增加30％的目标。
    草案规定，在今后五年期间，煤产量将增加一千五百五十万吨，比六年计划期间少24％。但是，每一个工作日的产量将由1955年的二十八万三千吨增加到1960年的三十六万吨。
    计划草案规定，钢的产量将增加63％，使1960年的年产量达到七百二十万吨。1960年机器制造工业的产量将比1955年增加一倍。
    英德里霍夫斯基说，这次议会讨论五年计划草案的时候正是在波兰对计划和管理国民经济的制度进行巨大的改革的时候，也正是在生产企业建立工人自治机构以及采取措施给企业以自治权利和扩大价值规律在我国经济中的作用范围的时候。这些趋向于分散经营和民主化的改变会对编制五年计划产生巨大的影响。
    接着，议员兰格提出了议会财政和预算委员会关于五年计划草案的报告。报告认为五年计划法案应提交下届议会通过，本届议会可以采纳这个计划草案作为行动指针，作为制定1957年计划的基础。
