Xinhua News Agency, Harbin Dispatch (Xinhua News Agency Reporter Han Zhifei): The Xinghuo Collective Farm in Huachuan County, Heilongjiang Province, which is famous for its rice production, suffered a loss of more than 4.8 million catties of rice this year, which is deeply distressing to people.

In the past five years, the Xinghuo Collective Farm has had bumper rice harvests every year. This year, the 520 hectares planted also grew very well. In the earlier period, it was estimated that each hectare could yield 12,000 to 13,000 catties. But now it seems that the yield per hectare can only reach 2,700 catties at most. The Xinghuo Collective Farm has mechanized and electrified its land cultivation, sowing, and irrigation. The farm members are also experienced Korean farmers in rice cultivation, and they also have the help of rice technicians. Why did such a serious reduction in production still occur? The reporter interviewed Shan Jiemin, Secretary of the Huachuan County Party Committee, Li Zaigen, Vice Chairman of the farm, and the farm members on this issue. Their opinions on this issue are not consistent. Some people think it is a seed problem, some people think it is a climate problem, and some people think there are problems with technical reforms. Which one is the fundamental reason for the reduction in production has not yet been identified by the agricultural technology department. According to the reporter's analysis of many cases, it is believed that the decrease in rice production at the Xinghuo Collective Farm is due to problems with the rice seeds.

Originally, the Xinghuo Collective Farm had been planting "Beihai No. 1" and "Shishirishiro," and other rice varieties that were famous in the Northeast and had strong disease resistance. In the autumn of 1955, there was a lot of rain, and the snow fell early in the winter. Therefore, the moisture content of the rice seeds of this collective farm reached 15.6%. According to the farmers' experience, if the moisture content of the rice seeds exceeds 15%, they should be stored in small stacks. However, the leaders of the Xinghuo Collective Farm ignored this experience and piled the rice seeds together. As a result, the germination rate only reached 40%. In desperation, on the eve of sowing, they hastily transferred a batch of food grain from the Ning'an County Grain Depot as seeds. This batch of seeds was mixed with eight varieties. According to experienced rice growers, this type of rice is not only weak in disease resistance, but it also carries rice blast germs itself. Although the rice seedlings grew very well during the growth period, the temperature in May and June was about four degrees higher than in previous years, and July and August were rainy, which created conditions for the Ning'an mixed rice seeds carrying rice blast germs to spread the germs. Therefore, all the rice fields of the Xinghuo Collective Farm that used Ning'an rice seeds suffered from this disease that seriously affected production.

Among these severely damaged rice fields, there were also 1.3 hectares planted with the "Shishirishiro" variety. These rice plants had a good harvest, with a yield of more than 11,000 catties per hectare. This small rice field was not infected with rice blast at all. When the rice seeds were accidentally sown into the ridges of Ning'an rice seeds, the seedlings were also healthy and unharmed; however, the Ning'an rice seeds sown in this small rice field also suffered from rice blast. These facts show that the fundamental reason for the decrease in rice production at the Xinghuo Collective Farm this year is the poor quality of the seeds.

    星火集体农庄水稻为何减产？
    主要原因是：原来的良种没保存好全部坏了，换用的种子又带有病菌。
    据新华社哈尔滨电　新华社记者韩之非报道：在黑龙江省桦川县以盛产水稻著名的星火集体农庄，今年有四百八十多万斤稻谷遭受了损失，人们都为这件事深感痛心。
    星火集体农庄在过去五年中水稻年年丰收。今年栽培的五百二十公顷，生长得也很好，前一个时期估计每公顷可收一万二、三千斤。可是现在看来，每公顷产量顶多只能收两千七百斤。星火集体农庄耕地、播种和灌溉都已经机械化和电气化了，庄员又都是种水稻有经验的朝鲜族农民，还有水稻技术人员的帮助，为什么还发生了这样严重减产的事情呢？记者就这个问题访问了中共桦川县委书记单洁民、农庄副主席李在根和农庄的庄员们。他们对这个问题的意见还不一致，有的人认为是种子问题，有人认为是气候问题，还有的人认为是技术改革上有问题。究竟哪一项是减产的根本原因，还没有经过农业技术部门的鉴定。据记者从很多事例分析，认为星火集体农庄的水稻减产是因为稻种有问题。
    本来，星火集体农庄几年来都是种的在东北负有盛名、抗病力强的“北海一号”和“石狩白毛”等水稻品种。1955年秋天多雨，冬天雪下得也早，因此，这个集体农庄稻种的水分达到了15.6％，根据农民的经验，稻种的水分超过15％，就应设法分成小垛储存。但是，星火集体农庄的领导人忽视了这个经验，又把稻种堆放到一起。结果，发芽率只达到40％。在没有办法的情况下，在播种前夕，才匆忙地由宁安县粮库里调来一批食粮作种子。这批种子是由八个品种混杂在一起的，据稻作有经验的人说，这种水稻不仅抗病力弱，它本身就带有稻热病菌。稻苗在生育期间虽生长得很好，但由于5、6月间温度较历年高四度左右，7、8月又阴雨连绵，这就给带有稻热病菌的宁安杂种稻籽造成蔓延病菌的条件。因此，星火集体农庄凡是采用宁安稻种的稻田，全部发生了这种严重影响产量的病害。
    在这些严重灾害的稻田中间，还有一点三公顷是用“石狩白毛”品种的，这些水稻得到了很好的收成，一公顷核收一万一千多斤。这小块稻田根本就没有感染上稻热病。在播种时把这个稻籽不小心播到宁安稻种的畦子里的，禾苗也都健壮无恙；播到这小块稻田里的宁安稻种，却同样的得了稻热病。这些事实说明，星火集体农庄今年水稻减产的根本原因是种子不良。
