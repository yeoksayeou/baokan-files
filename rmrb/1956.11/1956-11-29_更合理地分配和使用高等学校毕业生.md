    More Rational Allocation and Use of University Graduates
    Song Cheng, Director of Student Management Department, Ministry of Higher Education
    The centralized allocation and utilization of tens of thousands of university graduates with various specialties by the state each year is a complex and meticulous task. In the past, the government's work arrangements for university graduates were generally appropriate, and the vast majority of graduates were able to happily obey the assignments and make achievements in their work. However, this work also had some shortcomings and errors. First, it violated the principle of aligning education with application, and the phenomenon of unreasonable allocation and use of graduates and waste of talent was still quite common and serious. Second, some graduates' spousal relationships and personal practical difficulties, which should have been taken care of and could have been taken care of, were not given appropriate consideration; insufficient attention was paid to graduates' regional preferences when allocating them.
    The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a conference on intellectual issues, and the State Council in its "Instructions on the Unified Allocation of University Graduates Nationwide for the Summer of 1956" put forward clear improvement measures for the shortcomings in the unified allocation work in the past, which greatly encouraged university graduates over the years. Many people exposed the shortcomings in the allocation work and actively put forward requirements for adjusting the work. This is of great help to improving the unified allocation of graduates.
    Based on the information already understood, I feel that the problems in the unified allocation of university graduates mainly include the following aspects.
    First, the issue of implementing the principle of aligning education with application, overcoming the phenomenon of wasting talent, and rationally allocating and using graduates.
    The unreasonable allocation and use of graduates and the phenomenon of wasting talent can be roughly divided into three categories: one category is forcing graduates to unnecessarily change careers, preventing them from发挥 their expertise, and failing to align education with application; another category is having graduates do general work that does not require specialized knowledge, making inefficient use of talent; and yet another category is overstaffing, leaving graduates with no work to do for a long time, resulting in a backlog of talent. The reasons for these phenomena are multifaceted, mainly due to bureaucracy in the graduate allocation work, which fails to understand the needs of employers and the professional uses of graduates, as well as the departmentalism of employers, which unilaterally emphasizes the needs of their own units. This year, when formulating the allocation plan, the allocation of graduates in individual majors was very inappropriate due to the lack of in-depth understanding of the professional uses of graduates and the actual needs of employing departments.
    Some central employing departments lack the necessary understanding of what kind of professional graduates their affiliated units need, how many people are needed, and which factories, mines, and enterprises graduates of which majors are suitable to go to. As a result, the allocation plan formulated by this department for its affiliated units is not practical, and it also causes a lot of talent waste. After some graduates are dispatched to designated factories and mines according to the allocation plan of the employing department, they find that what is needed is not the field they studied at all. Some factories and mines plan to start work in 1957 or 1958, but the leading departments have already equipped them with graduates needed for production this year; some units have already been abolished, but the higher-level departments leading them still send graduates to them; some units are equipped with graduates whose majors are suitable, but the number exceeds the needs. As a result, many graduates have no choice but to be idle after arriving at their work posts, and the useful talents urgently needed by the state are thus piled up.
    The main reason for the waste of talent is that the specific work arrangements after the graduates arrive at the work unit are unreasonable. Some comrades who do personnel work in employing units have only a general concept of the majors of university graduates, and believe that university graduates are "generalists" who can do everything. Some employing units overemphasize the need for specialized talent, believing that it is always better to have a technician than none, and that a college student is always better than a general cadre, and thus make inefficient use of graduates. When the number of graduates sent by higher-level departments exceeds the needs of the unit or the major studied is inconsistent with the business nature of the unit, some employing units do not take the correct attitude to put forward reasonable adjustment opinions, but regard them as bargaining chips, asking higher-level departments to reassign some graduates who meet the needs of the unit in exchange. If the requirements are not met, they refuse to transfer them out, arbitrarily let them change careers or keep them idle for a long time.
    Second, the issue of views on the principle of "aligning education with application."
    Implementing the principle of aligning education with application does not mean that all career changes are unreasonable. Due to the continuous development of the country's construction undertakings, the number and proportion of various specialized talents cultivated by universities cannot fully meet the actual needs. The number of graduates in some majors is far from the number urgently needed for this aspect of work in the country. At the same time, various construction undertakings will generate some new production departments and technical jobs in the process of development, requiring some new professional talents, which universities have not yet had time to cultivate. In order not to delay the progress of construction, some graduates of similar majors have to be assigned to do these jobs. This is necessary. Of course, the work needs mentioned here are in terms of the national scope, and it is necessary to weigh the urgency of needs in various aspects, and not to make graduates who are more needed in other aspects change careers because of the needs of one aspect.
    However, if graduates are to change careers due to work needs, it must be handled with caution. It is necessary to carefully study the graduates' majors and business needs, and compare which majors of graduates are more suitable for doing those jobs. At the same time, it is also necessary to explain the work needs to the graduates who are changing careers and persuade them to obey the needs of the work. However, some employing units lightly let graduates change careers without careful consideration, and the changes are very inappropriate, which not only fails to solve the needs of the work, but also causes a waste of talent. Some employing units even use the excuse that the work of the unit needs it to let graduates change careers unnecessarily, keeping the graduates who are urgently needed by other units in the unit. In fact, this is not a work need, but a practice of using "work needs" to cover up departmentalism.
    On the other hand, some graduates have put forward some inappropriate requirements for adjusting work due to an incorrect understanding of the principle of aligning education with application. For example, some graduates believe that all career changes are unreasonable, and when it is indeed necessary to change careers for work needs, they are unwilling to obey the needs of the work. Some graduates have a very narrow understanding of the principle of aligning education with application, believing that graduates of a major can only do one or a very few jobs to be considered aligning education with application, for example, believing that those who study Chinese language must engage in creation to be considered aligning education with application. Some graduates regard whether personal interests are satisfied as the standard for aligning education with application, and if the work does not meet their interests, it is not considered aligning education with application. The interests of graduates should be taken care of in the allocation work, but the needs of the work cannot be ignored to take care of the interests; it is difficult to take care of the interests of every graduate in the allocation work, and there should not be excessive demands in this regard.
    Third, the issue of "local allocation and local employment."
    The State Council's "Instructions on the Unified Allocation of University Graduates Nationwide for the Summer of 1956" mentioned: "When formulating the specific allocation plan for this year's university graduates, the Ministry of Higher Education should try its best to achieve local allocation and local employment." That is to say, it requires the Ministry of Higher Education to take into account the distribution of graduates of various majors nationwide when allocating graduates according to the allocation plans of various employing departments, and to take care of the regions of the graduates as much as possible, so that they can participate in work locally and avoid or reduce unnecessary mutual transfers of graduates of the same major in different regions.
    In this year's actual allocation work, the Ministry of Higher Education has paid attention to implementing this spirit. Most of the normal and agricultural graduates have achieved local allocation.
    However, there are still unnecessary mutual transfers between regions for graduates of individual majors, which is a waste and should be seriously improved in the future.
    It should also be noted that the key areas of industrial construction in our country are not consistent with the areas where universities are concentrated, and graduates of some majors are only available in one or two schools, which need to supply the needs of the whole country, resulting in more transfers of graduates, and many graduates have to be transferred from their original areas to work in other places. Only more than 1,000 of the more than 5,000 graduates in Shanghai Municipality are assigned to work in Shanghai Municipality; only more than 900 of the more than 2,000 graduates in Guangdong Province are assigned to work in Guangdong Province.
    Some graduates do not consider the needs of various aspects of national construction enough, and believe that they should stay and work where they graduated, and are unwilling to go to other places. For example, some graduates in Shanghai Municipality are unwilling to leave Shanghai, and even request to stay in Shanghai City, and are unwilling to go even to Pudong on the opposite bank of the Huangpu River. This not only distorts the basic spirit of "local allocation and local employment," but also uses "local allocation and local employment" as an excuse to achieve unreasonable personal demands.
    Fourth, the issue of taking care of graduates' spousal relationships and personal practical difficulties.
    When allocating graduates, appropriate care has generally been given to graduates' spousal relationships and personal practical difficulties as much as possible. At the same time, there are also some graduates' spousal relationships and personal practical difficulties that should and could have been taken care of, but were not taken care of due to shortcomings in the allocation work. Some universities do not have a clear understanding of graduates' spousal relationships and personal practical difficulties, so they have not been taken care of. Although some schools are aware of graduates' spousal relationships and practical difficulties, they lack flexibility in implementing the allocation plan and have not taken care of them in order to complete the allocation numbers. After some graduates arrive at their work posts, although the work units where they are located are aware that their spousal relationships or some practical difficulties have not been taken care of, they do not try to remedy the situation because they are afraid that the cadres of the unit will be transferred out. Some units even drag on for a long time over the transfer of graduates, ignoring the spousal relationships and practical difficulties of the graduates.
    It should also be noted that much of the construction work is starting from scratch and is very difficult. In order to adapt to the construction of new industrial bases, the transfer of some graduates is relatively large. This makes it difficult to fully take care of the personal difficulties of some graduates for a while, and they need to overcome these temporary difficulties; many of them have in fact done so, and have enthusiastically embarked on work posts in remote areas and other difficult areas.
    However, there are also a few graduates who exaggerate their personal difficulties and put forward some unreasonable demands. For example, one graduate once requested that the employing department guarantee that he would have "a 30-square-meter house to live in" after arriving at the work post, otherwise he would not go. There was a couple who were assigned to work in two universities separated by a street, but they still requested to be transferred to the same unit. These demands are obviously excessive.
    It is a good performance for graduates to boldly expose the shortcomings in the allocation work and actively put forward requirements for adjusting work, and it should be warmly welcomed. Facts have proved that the vast majority of graduates who request to adjust their work do so out of a desire to put themselves in appropriate work posts and better serve socialist construction. On the other hand, there are also a small number of graduates who incorrectly understand the principle of aligning education with application, are unwilling to leave big cities, and excessively demand care. How should we estimate these two aspects of the situation? I think that the positive factors are the main and basic ones. However, some comrades who do allocation work only see the unreasonable demands of a few graduates, and do not see the most basic positive factors, and think that the graduates are ideologically backward. This will not be able to discover the shortcomings of the allocation work and improve them, and will not be able to correctly handle the reasonable requirements of graduates for adjusting work, which is not conducive to the work.
    Taking active measures to eliminate the shortcomings in the graduate allocation work can further发挥 the enthusiasm of the graduates, which will undoubtedly be of great benefit to the work. Employing departments should attach importance to the issue of work adjustment for graduates, actively inspect the work allocation of graduates, and adjust those whose work arrangements are inappropriate to fully发挥 their potential. If graduates think that their work or see that the work of other graduates is arranged inappropriately, they should actively put forward opinions on adjusting the work. This is an indispensable supervision for improving the graduate allocation work. Employing units should quickly solve the reasonable requirements of graduates for adjusting work that can be solved; if they cannot be solved temporarily, they should also explain them clearly to them. For graduates who put forward some unreasonable demands, they should be patiently persuaded and educated to enlighten their awareness, and should not be treated roughly.
    In fact, many employing units have done so, but not all employing units have done so. Some units have taken various wrong approaches to deal with the reasonable demands of graduates. Some units only see the needs of their own units, and do not give adjustments even if they know that the allocation and use of graduates are unreasonable, and even mobilize graduates to establish a "career change mentality." Some units are accustomed to using big hats to suppress the reasonable demands of graduates, and when graduates raise opinions, it is a "ideological problem," blaming graduates for "not being at ease with their work." Some units even use rough methods such as "stopping work" and "not paying wages" to deal with the requirements of graduates for adjusting work. More common is that higher-level departments use the excuse of not understanding the specific situation, and lower-level units use the excuse of not having the power to deal with it to shirk responsibility from each other. These all need to be corrected.
    It is hoped that relevant departments will jointly correct the shortcomings in the graduate allocation work, and it is hoped that graduate students will continue to make criticisms and suggestions, so that the unified allocation of graduates will continue to improve and become more perfect.

    更合理地分配和使用高等学校毕业生
    高等教育部学生管理司司长　宋诚
    每年几万名各种专业的高等学校毕业生，由国家集中地分配使用，是一件复杂、细致的工作。过去政府对高等学校毕业生的工作安排一般是妥当的，绝大部分毕业生都能够愉快地服从分配，在工作中做出了成绩。但是，这个工作也有一些缺点和错误，首先是违反学用一致的原则，对毕业生分配、使用不合理和浪费人材的现象，还相当普遍和严重。其次，对有一些毕业生的爱人关系和个人实际困难，应该照顾而且可能照顾的，没有给以适当的照顾；在调配毕业生的时候，对毕业生地区上的照顾注意不够。
    中共中央召开的知识分子问题会议，以及国务院在“关于1956年暑期全国高等学校毕业生统筹分配工作的指示”中，对于过去统一分配工作中的缺点，提出了明确的改进措施，使历年的高等学校毕业生受到了巨大的鼓舞，不少人揭发分配工作中的缺点，积极提出了调整工作的要求。这对于改进毕业生统一分配工作，有很大的帮助。
    从已经了解到的情况来看，我感到高等学校毕业生统一分配工作中的问题，主要有下列几方面。
    第一，贯彻学用一致原则、克服浪费人材现象，合理分配和使用毕业生的问题。
    对毕业生分配、使用不合理和浪费人材的现象，大体上可以分成三类：一类是让毕业生不必要地改行，不能发挥专长，学用不一致；一类是让毕业生做一些不需要专门知识的一般工作，大材小用；又一类是人浮于事，使毕业生长期没有工作可做，积压人材。造成这些现象的原因是多方面的，主要是毕业生分配工作中不了解用人单位的需要和毕业生专业用途的官僚主义，以及用人单位片面强调本单位工作需要的本位主义。今年在拟制分配计划的时候，由于对毕业生的专业用途和用人部门的实际需要的了解不深入，对个别专业的毕业生的分配就很不妥当。
    中央有的用人部门对所属单位的业务需要那一种专业的毕业生，需要多少人，以及那种专业的毕业生适合去那些厂、矿、企业工作，缺乏必要的了解，以致拟订的本部门对所属单位的毕业生配备计划不切合实际，也造成不少浪费人材的现象。有的毕业生根据用人部门的配备计划被派遣去指定的厂、矿以后，发现所需要的根本不是自己所学的这一行。有的厂、矿计划在1957年或1958年开工，但是领导部门却过早地在今年配备生产所需要的毕业生；有的单位早已撤销，领导它的上级部门仍然派毕业生去；有的单位配备的毕业生专业虽然合适，但是人数超过了需要。结果，许多毕业生到达工作岗位以后，只好闲着，国家急需的有用人材就这样积压起来。
    产生浪费人材现象的原因，主要是毕业生到达工作单位以后的具体工作安排得不合理。有些用人单位做人事工作的同志，对高等学校毕业生的专业只有一个笼统的概念，认为高等学校毕业生是“通材”，什么都能做。有的用人单位过分强调对专门人材的需要，不论什么工作，认为有一个技术人员总比没有好，有一个大学生总比一般干部强，因而对毕业生大材小用。有的用人单位，当上级部门派来的毕业生人数超过本单位的需要或者所学专业同本单位业务性质不一致的时候，不是采取正确的态度提出合理调整的意见，而是把他们当作讨价还价的本钱，要求上级部门改派一些合乎本单位需要的毕业生来交换，如果达不到要求，就不同意把他们调出去，任意让他们改行或把他们长期积压起来。
    第二，对“学用一致”原则的看法问题。
    贯彻学用一致原则，并不等于说一切改行都是不合理的。由于国家建设事业的不断发展，高等学校培养出来的各种专门人材的人数和比例，不可能完全符合实际需要。有的专业的毕业生人数同国家在这方面的工作迫切需要的人数来比较还差得很远。同时，各种建设事业在发展的过程中会产生一些新的生产部门和技术工种，需要一些新的专业人材，而高等学校还没来得及培养出来。为了不耽误建设的进行，不能不分配一些性质相近的专业的毕业生来做这些工作。这样做是必要的。当然，这里所说的工作需要，是就全国范围讲的，应该权衡各方面需要的缓急，不能因为某一方面的需要使其他方面更需要的毕业生改行。
    但是，由于工作需要，要毕业生改行，必须慎重处理，要很好地研究毕业生所学专业和业务需要，比较一下那种专业的毕业生改做那些工作更适合。同时，还要向改行的毕业生说明工作需要的情况，说服他们服从工作的需要。但是有的用人单位不经过认真的考虑，就轻率地让毕业生改行，改得很不妥当，既不能解决工作的需要，又造成人材的浪费。有的用人单位甚至借口本单位工作需要，让毕业生不必要地改行，把其他单位急需的毕业生留在本单位。实际上这不是什么工作需要，而是用“工作需要”来掩饰本位主义的做法。
    另一方面，有一些毕业生由于对学用一致原则的理解不正确，提出了一些不恰当的调整工作的要求。如有的毕业生认为一切改行都是不合理的，当确实是工作需要改行的时候，他们就不愿意服从工作的需要。有的毕业生对学用一致原则的理解很狭隘，认为一种专业的毕业生只能做一种或极少数几种工作才能算是学用一致，比如认为学中国语文的要搞创作才算学用一致。有的毕业生把是否满足个人的志趣当作学用一致的标准，工作不符合志趣就不算学用一致。毕业生的志趣在分配工作中是应该注意照顾的，但是，不能把工作需要置之不顾来照顾志趣；在分配工作中要照顾每一个毕业生的志趣是难以办到的，在这方面不应该有过高的要求。
    第三，“就地分配、就地就业”的问题。
    国务院“关于1956年暑期全国高等学校毕业生统筹分配工作的指示”提到：“在制定本届高等学校毕业生具体调配计划的时候，高等教育部应该尽可能地做到就地分配，就地就业。”这就是说，要求高等教育部在调配毕业生的时候，根据各用人部门的配备计划，结合全国各专业毕业生的分布情况，尽可能地照顾毕业生的地区，使他们就地参加工作，避免或者减少相同专业毕业生在地区上产生不必要的互相调动。
    在今年的实际调配工作中，高等教育部已经注意贯彻这种精神。师范和农科毕业生，大部分做到了就地分配。
    但是，对个别专业的毕业生，地区之间不必要的互相调动仍然有，这是一种浪费，今后应该认真改进。
    还应该看到目前我国工业建设的重点地区同高等学校集中的地区是不一致的，并且有的专业的毕业生仅一两所学校有，要供应全国的需要，以致毕业生的调动就比较多，许多毕业生不能不调离原地区到其他地方去工作。上海市五千多名毕业生分配在上海市工作的仅一千多名；广东省二千多名毕业生分配在广东省工作的仅九百多名。
    有的毕业生对国家各方面建设的需要考虑得不够，认为在什么地方毕业就要留在什么地方工作，别的地方就不愿意去，比如上海市有的毕业生不愿离开上海，甚至要求留在上海市内，连黄浦江对岸的浦东也不愿去。这不仅歪曲了“就地分配，就地就业”的基本精神，而且把“就地分配，就地就业”作为达到个人不合理的要求的一种借口。
    第四，对毕业生爱人关系和个人实际困难的照顾问题。
    在调配毕业生的时候，对毕业生的爱人关系和个人实际困难一般都尽可能地给与了适当的照顾。同时，也还有一些毕业生的爱人关系和个人实际困难，应该而且可能给以照顾的，由于调配工作中的缺点而没有给以照顾。有的高等学校对毕业生的爱人关系和个人实际困难，了解得不清楚，以致没有照顾到。有的学校虽然对毕业生的爱人关系和实际困难是了解的，但是执行调配计划缺乏灵活性，为了完成调配数字而没有给以照顾。有的毕业生到达工作岗位以后，所在工作单位虽然了解到他们的爱人关系或一些实际困难没有得到照顾，但是因为怕本单位的干部调出去而不去设法补救。有的单位甚至为了毕业生的调动长期扯皮，把毕业生的爱人关系和实际困难置之不顾。
    同时还要看到，建设工作很多是平地起家，十分艰苦。为了适应新工业基地的建设，某些毕业生的调动就比较多。这就使得有一部分毕业生的个人困难一时难以完全照顾，需要他们克服这些暂时的困难；他们中的许多人事实上已经这样做了，热情地走上了边远地区和其他艰苦地区的工作岗位。
    但是，也有少数毕业生夸大了个人的困难，提出了一些不合理的要求。如有一个毕业生曾经提出，要求用人部门保证他到达工作岗位以后“有三十平方公尺的房子住”，否则他不去。有一对爱人，分配到相隔一条马路的两所高等学校工作，但是他们还要求调在一个单位。这些要求显然是过分的。
    毕业生大胆揭发分配工作中的缺点，积极提出调整工作的要求，是一种好的表现，应该热忱欢迎。事实证明，绝大多数要求调整工作的毕业生，是出于想把自己放在恰当的工作岗位上，更好地为社会主义建设服务。另一方面，也有少部分毕业生不正确地理解学用一致原则，不愿意离开大城市，过分地要求照顾等。应该怎样来估计这两方面的情况呢？我认为，积极的因素是主要的、基本的。但是，有的作分配工作的同志只看到少数毕业生的不合理的要求，看不见最基本的积极因素，认为毕业生思想落后，这就不能很好地去发现分配工作中的缺点并加以改进，就不会去正确地处理毕业生调整工作的合理要求，对工作是不利的。
    采取积极的措施，消除毕业生分配工作的缺点，就可以进一步发挥毕业生的积极性，这对工作无疑是有很大好处的。用人部门应该重视毕业生的工作调整问题，主动地对毕业生的工作分配进行检查，对工作安排不妥当的，加以调整，充分发挥他们的潜力。毕业生如果认为自己的工作或是看见其他的毕业生的工作被安排得不妥当，应该积极提出调整工作的意见。这对于改进毕业生分配工作，是一种必不可少的督促。用人的单位对于毕业生合理的调整工作的要求，能够解决的，应该迅速地解决；暂时不能解决的也要向他们解释清楚。对于提出一些不合理的要求的毕业生，应该耐心地进行说服教育，启发他们的觉悟，不应该粗暴对待。
    事实上，许多用人单位已经这样做了，但是并不是所有的用人单位都是这样做的。有的单位采取了各种各样错误的做法来对待毕业生的合理要求。有的单位只看见本单位工作的需要，明知毕业生分配、使用不合理也不给以调整，甚至动员毕业生树立“改行思想”。有的单位习惯于用大帽子把毕业生的合理要求压回去，毕业生一提意见就是“思想问题”，责备毕业生“不安心工作”。甚至有的单位以“停止工作”、“不发工资”等粗暴的办法对待毕业生调整工作的要求。更普遍的是上级部门以不了解具体情况，下级单位以无权处理为借口，互相推诿。这些都需要纠正。
    希望有关部门共同纠正毕业生分配工作中的缺点，希望毕业学生们继续提出批评和建议，使毕业生统一分配工作不断改进，更加完善。
