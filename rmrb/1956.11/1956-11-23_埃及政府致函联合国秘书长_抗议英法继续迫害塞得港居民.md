Xinhua News Agency, November 22nd, Cairo: The Egyptian Government Information Service announced on the 21st that the Egyptian government has sent a letter to the UN Secretary-General, protesting the continued brutal persecution of residents of Port Said by British and French troops.

The letter stated that British and French troops are searching houses and attacking residents in the city. The British and French command authorities have, in effect, implemented a state of war, setting up military tribunals. The army commander admitted to disrupting all Egyptian radio broadcasts in order to cut off the city from any contact with the rest of the country. The invaders confiscated all radio receivers belonging to or used by the residents. The Egyptian government believes these actions are a shocking trampling of human rights.

The letter pointed out that British and French troops have blockaded the city, so no foreign journalists can see the results of the army's brutal attacks. British and French troops prevented twenty journalists from various countries from entering the city, and the troops even shot at them, detained them for twelve hours, and then transported them in a closed car to the suburbs, ordering them to return to Cairo immediately.

The letter said that, in addition, British and French troops prevented representatives and nurses of the Red Crescent from entering the city, preventing them from completing their mission. British and French troops made it impossible for the unfortunate residents who suffered the barbarous shelling and bombing by the British and French air and naval forces to obtain the medicine and food brought to them by the Red Crescent representatives. The invaders also prevented citizens from contacting their families who had left Port Said during the attacks.

The letter pointed out that this is only part of the atrocities committed by the British and French troops in Port Said by violating the UN's Declaration of Human Rights, and thus also violating the UN Charter.

The Egyptian government requests that this letter be distributed to all member states of the United Nations.

Xinhua News Agency, November 22nd, TASS, Stockholm, November 21st: The Swedish Farmers' Union's newspaper, "Swedish Daily," published an article written by its Port Said correspondent, Hallström. The journalist pointed out in the article that the British and French attacks on Port Said have caused serious damage to the city. He said: The fighting in the city lasted less than 24 hours, but during this time it has caused enormous destruction, entire streets have been completely destroyed. The old wooden houses built in the 1880s to house the Suez Canal construction workers have also been reduced to ashes. A large number of homeless people are now wandering around, hoping to find something in the ruins.

    埃及政府致函联合国秘书长
    抗议英法继续迫害塞得港居民
    新华社22日讯　开罗消息：埃及政府情报司21日宣布，埃及政府向联合国秘书长发出了一封信，抗议英法军队在继续残酷地迫害塞得港的居民。
    信中说，英法军队搜查房屋，攻击市内居民。英法指挥当局事实上实行了战争状态，设置了军事法庭。军队司令承认，扰乱了埃及的一切无线电广播，以便切断这个城市同国家其他部分的任何联系。侵略者没收了属于居民或者为居民使用的一切无线电收音机。埃及政府认为这些行动惊人地践踏了人权。
    信中指出，英法军队封锁了这个城市，于是没有一个外国记者能看到这些军队的残酷攻击的结果。英法军队阻止各国的二十个记者入城，而且军队还向他们射击了一阵，把他们扣留了十二小时，在这之后又把他们装在一辆密闭的汽车里运到城郊，命令他们立即回开罗。
    信中说，此外，英法军队阻止红新月会代表和护士进入市内，使他们无法完成自己的任务。英法军队使遭受英法海空军野蛮轰击和轰炸的不幸居民没有可能获得红新月会代表带给他们的医药和食品。侵略者也不让市民同他们在塞得港遭到袭击时离开的家属联系。
    信中指出，这只不过是英法军队破坏联合国的人权宣言、从而也就是破坏联合国宪章而在塞得港干的暴行的一部分而已。
    埃及政府要求把这封信散发给联合国各会员国。
    据新华社22日讯　塔斯社斯德哥尔摩21日讯：瑞典农民联盟机关报“瑞典日报”登载了这家报纸的塞得港特派记者哈利斯特雷姆写的一篇文章。记者在文章中指出英法对塞得港的袭击已经使这个城市遭受严重的破坏。他说：在城里进行战斗的时间不到一昼夜，但是，在这段时间里已经造成了巨大的破坏，整条整条的街都彻底被摧毁了。上世纪八十年代里给苏伊士运河建筑人员居住的古老的木房子也已经化为灰烬。大批无家可归的人家，现在来往徘徊着，希望在废墟中找到点东西。
