Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, November 20th: Antara News Agency reports that Indonesian Army Chief of Staff Nasution has summoned Colonel Simbolon, commander of the First Military Region, to Jakarta to discuss the current situation in the army and asked him to surrender command of the First Military Region.

Some time ago, an appointment was announced for former Deputy Army Chief of Staff Lubis to succeed Simbolon as commander of the First Military Region. Due to recent developments in the army, Lubis's appointment has been revoked. The position of commander of the First Military Region is temporarily held by another officer.

Indonesian newspapers report that Simbolon recently telegraphed Nasution twice, objecting to the disciplinary measures taken by the army authorities against three colonels.

According to a report in "Independent News" today, Abimanyu, commander of the Sixth Military Region, attempted to launch a "small armed coup" in Banjarmasin, Kalimantan, on November 15 (the day before some officers planned to launch a rebellion in the capital).

Abimanyu ordered Lieutenant Colonel Hasani Basri, commander of the 21st Regiment, to detain all officials and high-ranking officials arriving from Jakarta, including cabinet ministers, members of parliament and the constitutional assembly. The local commanders of Pontianak and Balikpapan also received the same order from Abimanyu. However, Lieutenant Colonel Basri refused this order. He and all the other officers of the 21st Regiment fully supported the measures taken by the Army Chief of Staff.

Meanwhile, the situation in Jakarta has eased somewhat. Major Juro, the Jakarta Garrison Commander, told the press on November 19 that the order for the assembly of army personnel had been cancelled from 12:00 on the 19th, because the situation in the capital was "no longer critical." However, his headquarters remains on alert.

The cabinet is scheduled to discuss the army issue at a meeting on the evening of November 20. Prime Minister Sastroamidjojo will discuss the same issue with the Parliament's Defense Subcommittee on November 22.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, November 19th: The Indonesian News Agency today quoted an army spokesman as saying that two more officers have been dismissed for "acts of indiscipline." They are Major Sadeli of the Cavalry Corps and Captain Arifin of the Army Training Inspectorate.

The Joint Chiefs of Staff of the Indonesian Army, Navy and Air Force issued a statement on November 17 calling on all personnel of the Indonesian armed forces to strictly observe military discipline in dealing with the current situation.

    印度尼西亚陆军继续整肃军纪
    传召第一军区司令并要他交出指挥权
    另有两个违反纪律的军官被解除职务
    新华社雅加达20日电　据安塔拉通讯社报道，印度尼西亚陆军参谋长纳苏蒂安已经传召第一军区司令西姆波朗上校到雅加达来讨论陆军的目前局势，并且要他交出第一军区的指挥权。
    前些时候曾经发表任命，由前陆军副参谋长卢比斯继西姆波朗任第一军区司令。由于陆军中的最近事态发展，对卢比斯的任命已经撤销。第一军区司令的职务暂由其他军官代行。
    据印度尼西亚报纸报道，西姆波朗最近曾经两次打电报给纳苏蒂安，反对陆军当局对三名上校所采取的纪律措施。
    据“独立报”今天报道，第六军区司令阿比曼约曾经在11月15日（即若干军官计划在首都发动叛变的前一日）企图在加里曼丹的马辰发动“小型武力政变”。
    阿比曼约曾经命令第二十一团团长哈萨尼·巴斯里中校拘捕从雅加达去的一切官员和高级官员，包括内阁部长，议会和制宪议会的议员等。坤甸和巴厘巴板的地方司令也接到了阿比曼约同样的命令。但是巴斯里中校拒绝了这个命令。他同第二十一团的其他军官全部支持陆军参谋长所采取的措施。
    同时，雅加达的局势已经比较缓和。雅加达警备司令朱罗少校11月19日对报界说，陆军人员的集合令已经从19日12时起取消，因为首都的情况已经“不再危急”。但是，他的司令部仍旧保持着警戒。
    内阁预定在11月20日晚上的会议上讨论陆军问题。沙斯特罗阿米佐约总理将在11月22日同议会的国防小组委员会讨论同样的问题。
    据新华社雅加达19日电　印度尼西亚新闻社今天援引陆军发言人的话说，又有两位军官由于“违反纪律的行动”而被解职。他们是骑兵兵团的萨德利少校和陆军训练督察署的阿里芬上尉。
    印度尼西亚陆海空军参谋长联席会议在11月17日发表了一个声明，要求印度尼西亚所有武装部队的人员在处理目前局势时，要严格遵守军事纪律。
