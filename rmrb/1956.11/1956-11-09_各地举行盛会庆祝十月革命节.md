Xinhua News Agency, 8th -- On the 6th and 7th, grand rallies were held in various provinces and many cities across the country, along with other activities, to warmly celebrate the 39th anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution.

Leading officials from the Party and government organs of various provinces and cities, as well as representatives from all sectors, participated in the local celebrations.

Personnel from the Soviet consulates in various parts of China, Soviet experts assisting in China's construction, as well as personnel and experts from other fraternal countries' consulates in China also participated in the celebrations in various locations.

At these celebrations, reports were given by local Party and government leaders or heads of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association. In their reports, they expressed heartfelt gratitude to the Soviet Union for its sincere and brotherly assistance to China, called upon the Chinese people to further study the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, and cheered for the great achievements made by the Soviet people in implementing the resolutions of the 20th Congress of the CPSU. Hui Yuyu, Governor of Jiangsu Province and President of the Jiangsu Province and Nanjing City Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, stated at the Jiangsu Province and Nanjing City celebration rally that all the great construction achievements that the Chinese people are proud of contain the selfless assistance and sincere friendship of the Soviet people. He expressed his heartfelt gratitude to the great Soviet people on behalf of the 43 million people of Jiangsu Province. At the celebration in Anshan, people expressed gratitude to the Soviet Union for its comprehensive and enormous assistance to the construction of Anshan Iron and Steel, China's steel base. Representatives from all sectors in Qinghai Province expressed gratitude at the celebration for the large-scale Soviet assistance to the exploration of oil and other resources in Qinghai Province. Ha Feng'a, President of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, pointed out at the celebration that the construction of the large-scale iron and steel complex in Inner Mongolia is inseparable from the help of the Soviet Union. He urged everyone to further study the rich experience of the Soviet Union to accelerate China's socialist construction. Speakers at celebrations held in Baoding, Jinan, Chengdu, Taiyuan, Fuzhou, Nanchang, and other places introduced the brilliant achievements made by the Soviet people under the leadership of the Soviet Communist Party and the Soviet government in the cause of communist construction, and wished the fraternal Soviet people even greater achievements in the future.

The celebrations in various places demonstrated that the Chinese people were pleased to see the achievements made by the Soviet Union in striving for the relaxation of international tensions, as well as its efforts in strengthening friendship and cooperation between the Soviet Union and socialist countries. The celebrations also showed the Chinese people's determination to further strengthen the deep friendship with the Soviet people. Deng Baoshan, Governor of Gansu Province and President of the Gansu Province and Lanzhou City Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, said at the celebration that the Soviet Union recently helped Hungary, at the request of the Hungarian Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government, to crush the restoration conspiracy of counter-revolutionary elements supported by imperialism; at the same time, the Soviet Union gave strong support to the Egyptian people's just struggle against Anglo-French aggression. This shows that the great Soviet Union is making ever greater contributions to the cause of defending world peace and human progress. Sun Junyi, Vice Governor of Qinghai Province and Vice President of the Qinghai Province Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, said at the celebration that the Soviet army helped the Hungarian people at a critical moment to save the Hungarian revolutionary cause and crushed the despicable conspiracy of imperialism and its lackeys to open a gap in the socialist camp in Hungary. This is not only a victory for the Hungarian people, but also an extremely great victory for all socialist countries and peace-loving people. Those who participated in the celebrations in Changchun and other places pointed out with satisfaction that the Soviet Union's assistance to Hungary in crushing the counter-revolutionary restoration conspiracy has great historical significance; and emphasized that no effort should be spared to consolidate and develop the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples in order to defend world peace and the cause of human progress.
