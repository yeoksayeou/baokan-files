In Expansion and Reconstruction, Pay Attention to Saving National Investment
Many Factories in Lüda Fully Utilize Existing Equipment

    This newspaper reports: In the expansion and reconstruction process, many factories in Lüda city have made full use of their existing factory buildings and equipment. In this year's large-scale reconstruction and expansion, the Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Manufacturing Factory, after investigation and appraisal, decided to utilize more than 1,500 units of old equipment originally belonging to the enterprise. They also plan to modify more than 100 units of relatively old and backward equipment according to the requirements of modern equipment. This will not only ensure the timely supply of equipment but also save an investment of more than 13 million yuan. During the second review of the Dalian Motor Factory's reconstruction and expansion plan, it was discovered that the approximately 1,500 square meters of factory buildings originally planned for demolition were still usable. Therefore, it was decided to preserve these factory buildings, saving an investment of more than 210,000 yuan. The Dalian Small Potassium Chloride Factory, which is currently being restored, has all its equipment made by workers using waste and old materials. This factory only spent more than 20,000 yuan to restore production, while it can create wealth worth hundreds of thousands of yuan every year.

    To fully utilize the existing foundation, it is necessary to oppose the mentality of favoring the new and disliking the old, and fearing trouble. It is also necessary to oppose the practice of rashly deciding to dismantle old equipment without investigation and appraisal. The No. 7 Petroleum Factory did not carefully study how to further exploit the potential of the existing equipment and decided to build a new workshop to process the outflow oil from the coking process. This would require an investment of more than 2 million yuan and more than 1,000 tons of steel, and it would take a long time. Later, after understanding from Soviet experts, it was believed that the equipment in this workshop still had great potential, and only a small investment of more than 100,000 yuan was needed to improve certain equipment, thus eliminating the need to build a new workshop. Fully utilizing the existing foundation can not only save investment, save foreign exchange, and reduce the design and manufacture of new equipment, but it can also put the project into production and play a role at an early date.

    在扩建改建中注意节省国家投资
    旅大许多工厂充分利用原有设备
    本报讯　旅大市许多工厂在改建和扩建中充分利用原有厂房和设备。大连机车车辆制造工厂在今年的大规模改建和扩建中，经过调查鉴定，决定对企业原有的一千五百多台旧设备加以利用。有一百多台比较陈旧落后的设备，他们也打算按照近代化设备的要求加以改装，这样，不但保证了设备的及时供应，还能节约价值一千三百多万元的投资。大连电机厂的改建和扩建方案在第二次审查时，发现原计划拆除的约一千五百平方公尺厂房仍然好用。于是决定保存这些厂房，节约投资二十一万多元。正在恢复中的大连小型氯化钾厂，全部设备都是工人利用废物旧料做成的。这个工厂只花两万多元，即恢复生产。而每年却可创造价值数十万元的财富。
    要充分运用原有基础，就要反对那种喜新厌旧和怕麻烦的思想，就要反对那种对旧有设备不经调查鉴定，轻率决定拆除的作法。石油七厂对如何进一步发挥原有设备的潜力没作仔细研究，就决定新建一个工段来处理焦化过程的流出油。这需要二百多万元的投资和一千多吨钢铁，而且需要很长的时间。后来经苏联专家了解，认为这个车间的设备仍有很大的潜力，只需要花十几万元的投资对某些设备加以改进，就可以不必新建这个工段。充分运用原有基础，不但可以节约投资，节约外汇，减轻对新设备的设计和制造，而且还可以使工程早日投入生产，发挥作用。
