    Promoting Distinctive Characteristics
    Hàn Fū
    Some time ago, I heard that Shanxi vinegar had lost its "Shanxi" flavor. It gave me quite a sour feeling and triggered a thought that eliminating distinctive characteristics, forcing uniformity, and favoring a single color is also a current malady. For example, didn't we have a wave of clothing improvements before some colorful clothes finally appeared? Some old restaurants in Beijing with over a century of history only started to restore their traditional features after some urging. I heard that the specialized business company also invited wine-tasting experts to specifically evaluate twelve famous domestic wines, but the results were said to be not very good. I don't know if the experts' tongues weren't sensitive enough, or if the wines had indeed lost their unique flavor, but in any case, none of them were highly rated. Regardless, it's simply that people are tired of "uniformity" and are starting to break it. This is a good phenomenon!
    We cannot force uniformity in clothing, nor can we promote "a single color" in art. However, this situation is not uncommon in opera and drama. After the Yue opera "Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai" made a big splash, other opera versions of "Liang Zhu" had no chance to be seen by the world. Even the Sichuan opera "Liuyin Ji" was altered to resemble the Yue opera version, and the Cantonese opera "Qin Xianglian" was revised according to the Ping opera script. The Shanghai Peking Opera's "Li Ling Stele" was also adapted from Shandong Bangzi. According to the artists, Hunan Flower Drum Opera has lost its flavor after absorbing other elements. However, enthusiastic instructors call it learning from others' strengths to make up for one's own weaknesses, and learning from excellent dramas. However, this learning is carried out under restrictions such as "singing too high is individualism, and moving too much is formalism." If artists raise any different opinions, they are labeled as "trying to be different" or "being conservative and backward"...
    Mutual learning and complementing each other's strengths are the fashion of our times, which is originally a good thing. Learning from others' strengths to make up for one's own weaknesses is also one of the paths to progress. But first, we should clarify where the strengths and weaknesses lie. Otherwise, in order to take other people's strengths, we will abandon our own strengths and weaknesses altogether, disregarding our own traditions and characteristics, and being unable to distinguish between the essence and the dross, simply copying others mechanically, which will not only not help, but even be harmful. To mend clothes, you also have to find the same color of cloth, or dye it the same color. If you don't choose and stick everything on your body, the result can only be to patch the cloth jacket into a "Bagua fairy garment."
    I don't think we need to ask jasmine to give off the fragrance of peony, and the reason why a rose is a rose is precisely because it has thorns. If you don't like it, it's just a matter of different interests. Please don't rashly cut off the thorns of the rose. Disregarding common sense and abusing power is dangerous.

    发扬特点
    汗夫
    前些时候，听说山西醋丢了“山西”味儿，我心里可确乎酸过一下，并且引起了一种感想，以为消灭特点，强求一律，喜欢搞清一色，也是目下的一种时弊。譬如说吧，不是闹了一阵服装改进，才有了些花衣服出现吗？北京的一些百年以上的老饭铺，叫了一阵，才开始恢复传统特点；听说专卖事业公司又请了品酒专家，专门品评了一下国内的十二种名酒，但据说结果不大好，不知专家们的舌头不灵敏，还是各家酒的确失去了独有的醇味，总之，一样也没品上。无论如何，总是人们对“清一色”表示厌腻，要起来打破了。这是好现象！
    穿衣戴帽不能强求一律，对艺术也不能搞“清一色”。可是，这种情形在戏曲艺术中并不少见。越剧的“梁山伯与祝英台”大出风头之后，别的剧种的“梁祝”就无缘和世人见面了，连川剧的“柳荫记”也照着越剧的模样改过，粤剧的“秦香莲”也按照评剧的本子改了一番；上海京剧院的“李陵碑”也是从山东梆子套下来的。而据艺人们反映，湖南花鼓戏因为吸收了别的东西，已经失却了花鼓戏的味儿了。但热心的指导者们称之为取长补短，向优秀剧目学习。然而这学习却是在“唱高了是个人主义，动作大了是形式主义”之类的禁条下进行的，艺人们稍微提点不同意见，便是“标新立异”“保守落后”……。
    相互学习、取长补短是我们时代的风尚，这原是好事情；博采众家所长，补自己之短，也正是进步的路径之一。但首先应当弄清长在哪里，短在何处？否则，为了取人家的长，把自己的长、短一古脑儿丢开，不顾及自己的传统、特点，分不清精华和糟粕，一味地生搬硬套，那不但对事情无补，甚且是有害的了。补衣服也要找同样颜色的布，或者染成同样颜色，倘使不加选择地都往自己身上贴，那结果只能把布褂缀成“八卦仙衣”了。
    我看不必要求茉莉放出芍药香来，蔷薇之为蔷薇正是由于有刺，您不喜欢，那是兴趣之不同。敬请慢动板刀砍掉蔷薇的刺。不顾常识，滥用权力，那可是危险的。
