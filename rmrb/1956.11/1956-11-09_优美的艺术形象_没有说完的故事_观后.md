    The Beautiful Artistic Image
    -- After Viewing "The Unfinished Story"
    Li Shaobai

    "You know the responsibility of a factory director, and that's possible, but the responsibility of a Soviet person..."

    This is what the protagonist Muromtseva in "The Unfinished Story" said to the factory director who "polluted the air of the entire district." Here, the film hints at its central idea. Muromtseva is precisely such a person who not only understands "the responsibility of the job" but, more importantly, understands "the responsibility of a Soviet person."

    To create the image of such an advanced figure, the author could use so-called "major themes" to express it; however, here the author did not do so. He found a novel path—through seemingly extremely ordinary things—to complete the task of shaping Muromtseva's perfect image.

    Everyone who has seen the film will be moved by Muromtseva's simple and beautiful image. She is an ordinary person, with nothing special about her. Like everyone else, she lives an ordinary life and does ordinary work. In her experiences, there is joy, but also sadness and distress. However, when you observe all of her actions and then synthesize and savor them, you will feel that behind her seemingly ordinary actions, there is a noble heart beating!

    The things Muromtseva does are ordinary, commonplace, and one might even say that they do not go beyond the scope of her work as a doctor. She is busy and tired all day long, going up and down stairs, all to see patients; even the other things she intervenes in, such as the factory's smoke, cannot but be said to be related to her job as a doctor. But she is by no means just a person who is merely loyal to her duties. Don't you think that her sternly rebuking the high blood pressure patient who doesn't rest, rebuking the barber who has lost confidence in whether his heart disease can be cured, and rebuking old man Spirin who refuses to send his granddaughter with pneumonia to the hospital, are precisely out of her eager care for them? Don't you think that when she puts in strenuous labor for the pneumonia-stricken girl, when she carries the girl back and forth in the quiet of the night, when she notices that the girl's condition has improved, and sits wearily on the floor by the bed, with a happy smile on her face, isn't it precisely out of her sincere love for people? When you see old man Spirin saddened by his granddaughter's illness, and she puts her hand on his shoulder, wanting to comfort him, but immediately takes her hand back and sternly tells them all to come out and not to cry and disturb her work, don't you feel that behind that stern face and words, there is genuine sympathy for them? When you see her resolutely fighting against the factory director who only has a sense of responsibility for his job and no sense of responsibility for people, and sternly rebuking the person who tries to fraudulently obtain a sick leave certificate, don't you feel her high sense of responsibility as a Soviet person?

    It is precisely because of this that people call her a "strict doctor" and also "our doctor."

    It is precisely because of this that when her beneficial labor to others is effective, she feels the greatest joy and happiness.

    However, merely depicting one side of social life cannot undertake the task of comprehensively displaying the rich psychological activities of the characters. Here, the author also brilliantly describes her love, although these descriptions still have shortcomings, they still have their own unique points. And the contrast between her lonely single life and her strong pursuit of love plays a good role in highlighting the emotional world of the character.

    Her personal life is unfortunate. She lost her husband and lives a single life, cooking her own meals, tidying up her own room..., although work brings her joy and happiness, she is not satisfied with this single life, as she said when answering the doctor Akanin who is pursuing her:

    "I very much hope to be happy myself, and I am the same as every woman..." Precisely because she loves life, she cherishes love so seriously and treats it meticulously. After she discerned Akanin's selfish nature, she resolutely rejected his love, and it was precisely after she deeply understood the excellent qualities of the patient Yershov that she fell deeply in love with him. People can deeply understand the heart of a noble woman and glimpse her subtle and complex emotional world from her love life encounters, from her listening to Yershov's mother and no longer going to see Yershov for treatment while enduring the great misfortune of her personal life, and from later hearing that Yershov's condition had deteriorated and rushing to Yershov's home regardless of everything.

    Being good at profoundly excavating the emotions, character, and qualities of characters through ordinary daily labor and through the lives of ordinary people is an important artistic feature of this film.

    Some of our film authors only know how to express characters in major events, while ignoring the shaping of real character images. The characters' thoughts, feelings, and personalities are drowned out by a series of events, leaving people with only some dry sermons and a few abstract concepts. The authors of these films seem to have forgotten that people not only experience major events but also live ordinary daily lives. They have forgotten that the expression of a character's qualities and personality lies not in "what" he does, but in "how" he does it. They have forgotten that the formation of a typical character requires expression through rich inner activities and vividly individual sensory images. In these areas, the film should be enlightening to us.

    The lens structure and scene scheduling of this film also have their own characteristics. The author tries to maintain the integrity of his own style. Like the content itself, its artistic form is also simple and lyrical, with no artificial tension and symbolic descriptions, everything is like life itself. However, this does not mean that it is not necessary to carry out accurate and appropriate arrangements and treatments of lenses and scenes according to the requirements of the film's ideological content to achieve clear and prominent artistic effects. On the contrary, this requires the author to do so even more. The author of this film is good at mastering the characteristics of the art of film expression, using lens transitions to contrast, emphasize, and set off important things, making them more vivid and profound.

    In dealing with the scene where Spirin asks Muromtseva to see the child, the author leaves us with such an impression through the clever contrast between Muromtseva and Akanin. Initially, we see the different attitudes of Muromtseva and Akanin towards Spirin, who comes to ask for a doctor: Akanin blames him for not disturbing the doctor late at night, while Muromtseva blames him for not sending the child to the hospital, and then she agrees to see the patient and tells Akanin that if he wants, he can stay and wait for her. Then the scene turns to Spirin's house, we see all kinds of situations when Muromtseva sees the girl, and then the scene turns back, we see Akanin waiting impatiently; then, the scene turns to Spirin's house again, we see Muromtseva picking up the child and walking back and forth, and then the scene turns back, Akanin from impatience to anger, pushed down the chair and walked out. Such mutual contrast not only received a good dramatic effect, but also fully expressed the character and qualities of Muromtseva and Akanin.

    The same is true of the concert scene. Through a variety of lens transitions, the author expresses the concentration of attention of the audience, the concentration of attention of Muromtseva, while Akanin is so uninterested, and finally, through Muromtseva's eyes, sees that he is actually asleep. Then, the scene turns to Yershov's house, he listens to the concert program from the radio and then lies down tiredly. Because the film so skillfully uses the expressive means of the lens, in just a few minutes, through this very ordinary life detail, the characteristics and hobbies of these three characters are expressed so profoundly and vividly!

    The profound and moving nature of Muromtseva's image should largely be attributed to the acting skills of the young actress Bystritskaya. She truly penetrated the character's soul, appreciated the character's emotions and temperament, and found the most accurate acting means to display these emotions and temperament, so that you can feel the character's thoughts in the smallest aspects. Her every expression and action makes you feel real. Active scenes are not only created by the screenwriter and director, but also should be created by the actors. From Bystritskaya's performing arts, we see exactly this.

    And from Bystritskaya's excellent acting skills, we also deeply realize that only when the actor delves into the role, understands the character's temperament, personality, and inner emotions, and finds the most appropriate and accurate expressions and actions to express these temperaments, personalities, and inner emotions, can he create a vivid and fascinating image.

    "Soviet Film Week" has brought the deep friendship of the Soviet people to the Chinese people, and has also given Chinese filmmakers a good opportunity to learn Soviet film art.

    优美的艺术形象
    ——“没有说完的故事”观后
    李少白
    “你知道厂长的责任，这可能，可是一个苏维埃人的责任……”
    这是“没有说完的故事”里的主人公穆洛姆卓瓦向那个“弄脏了全区的空气”的厂长所说的一句话。在这里，影片提示了它的中心思想。穆洛姆卓瓦正是这样一个不仅懂得“职务的责任”、而更重要的是懂得“苏维埃人的责任”的人。
    要塑造这样一个先进人物的形象，作者可以通过所谓“重大的题材”来表现；但是，在这里作者却没有这样做。他找到了一个新颖的途径——通过那些看来极为普通的事情，来完成了塑造穆洛姆卓瓦的完美形象的任务。
    所有看过影片的人，都会为穆洛姆卓瓦的朴实而优美的形象所激动。她是一个普通的人，没有什么特殊之处。她和所有的人一样，过着平凡的生活，做着平凡的工作。在她的遭遇里，有欢乐，也有悲伤和苦恼。但是，当你观察了她的全部行为，并加以综合、回味之后，你会感到，在她的那些看来平凡的行为后面，却有着一颗崇高的心在跃动着！
    穆洛姆卓瓦所做的事情，是平凡的，屡见不鲜的，甚至可以说没有超越出她做医生的职务范围。她整天地忙、累，从一个楼梯走上另一个楼梯，都不外乎是给病人看病；即使是她干预的其他事情，像工厂的煤烟之类的事情，也不能不说是与她的医生职务有关。但是她绝不是一个仅仅忠于职守的人。你不觉得，她严厉地责备那个不休息的高血压病人，责备那个对自己的心脏病能否治好失去信心的理发师，责备那个不肯把患肺炎的孙女送进医院去的老人斯皮林爷爷，正是出于对她们的热切关怀吗？你不觉得，当她为那个患肺炎的女孩的病付出紧张劳动的时候，当她抱着那个女孩子在夜深寂静的房间里来回走动的时候，当她察觉到那个女孩子的病情有了好转、疲惫地坐在床边的地板上、脸上流露出幸福微笑的时候，不正是出于她对人的赤诚的热爱吗？当你看到斯皮林爷爷为孙女的病伤心难过，她把手放在他的肩上，想安慰他，但马上又把手拿回来，严厉地叫他们都出来，不要哭哭啼啼地妨碍她的工作的时候，你不觉得，在那严厉的面孔和词句后面，有着对他们的真挚的同情吗？当你看到她对那个只有职务的责任感、而没有对人的责任感的厂长进行坚决斗争的时候，对那个企图骗取病假证的人给以严词斥责的时候，你不觉得，她对苏维埃人高度负责的精神吗？
    正是这样，人们称呼她是“严厉的医生”而又是“我们的医生”。
    正是这样，当她的与人有益的劳动收到成效的时候，她感到了最大的快乐和幸福。
    但是仅仅是描写社会生活的一面，还不能担负起多方面展示人物丰富的心理活动的任务。在这里作者还十分出色地描写了她的爱情，尽管这些描写还有缺点，但它仍然有着自己的独到之处。而在她那孤独的单身生活和她对爱情的强烈追求的映衬之下，更起到了突出人物感情世界的良好作用。
    她的个人生活是不幸的。她死去了丈夫，过着单身的生活，自己煮饭、自己收拾房间……，虽然工作给她带来了愉快和幸福，但她并不满足这种一个人的生活，正如她回答追求她的医生阿卡宁时所说：
  “我非常希望自己幸福，我也和每一个妇女一样……”。正由于她热爱生活，她才那样严肃地珍惜爱情，一丝不苟地对待它。在她洞悉了阿卡宁的自私本质之后，毅然拒绝了他的爱情，也正是在她深刻地了解病人耶尔硕夫的优秀品质之后，才深深地爱上了他。人们从她的爱情生活的遭遇中，从她听了耶尔硕夫母亲的话不再去给耶尔硕夫看病而忍受着个人生活的巨大不幸，和后来听说耶尔硕夫病情恶化，不顾一切地奔到耶尔硕夫家里来这种种行为中，你深刻地了解到了一个崇高的女性的心，窥视到了她的微妙、复杂的感情世界。
    善于通过平凡的日常劳动，通过普通人的生活，深刻地挖掘出人物的感情、性格与品质，是这部影片的一个重要的艺术特色。
    我们有些影片的作者，只知道在重大事件中表现人物，而忽视了真实的人物形象的塑造。人物的思想、感情、性格，被一连串发生的事件淹没了，留给人们的，只有一些干巴巴的说教和几个抽象的概念。这些影片的作者似乎忘记了人们不仅经历重大的事件，同时还过着普通的日常生活。忘记了人物的品质、个性的表现，不在于他“做什么”，而在于他“怎样做”。忘记了人物的典型性格的形成，是要求通过丰富的内心活动和鲜明个性的感性形象来表现的。在这些地方、影片对我们应该是有启发的。
    这部影片的镜头结构和场面调度，也是有着自己的特色的。作者极力保持自己风格的完整。像内容本身一样，它的艺术形式也是朴实的、抒情的，没有人为的紧张情节和象征性的描写，一切都像生活本身那样。但是，这并不是说，这样就不需要根据影片的思想内容的要求，进行确切恰当的镜头、场面的安排和处理，达到鲜明突出的艺术效果。恰恰相反，这更要求作者这样做。这部影片的作者，善于掌握电影表现艺术的特性，通过镜头的转换，进行对比，强调出、衬托出重要的东西，使之更加鲜明、更加深刻。
    在处理斯皮林请穆洛姆卓瓦给孩子看病那场戏，作者就是通过穆洛姆卓瓦和阿卡宁的巧妙对比，给我们留下这样的印象的。最初我们看到的是，穆洛姆卓瓦和阿卡宁对来请医生的斯皮林的不同的态度：阿卡宁责备他不应在深夜来麻烦医生，而穆洛姆卓瓦却责备他不该不把孩子送去医院，之后，她答应去看病，并且对阿卡宁说如果他愿意可以留下等她。接着镜头转到斯皮林的家，我们看到了穆洛姆卓瓦给女孩子看病时的各种情形，接着镜头又转回来，我们看到阿卡宁正不耐烦地等待着；之后，镜头又转到斯皮林的家，我们看到的是穆洛姆卓瓦抱起孩子来回走动，接着镜头又转回来，阿卡宁由不耐烦到发怒，推倒椅子走了出去。这样的相互对比，不仅收到了很好的戏剧效果，而且把穆洛姆卓瓦和阿卡宁两个人的性格、品质充分地表现了出来。
    还有那个音乐会的场面，也是如此。作者通过多种的镜头转换，表现出那些听众的注意力的集中，穆洛姆卓瓦的注意力的集中，而阿卡宁却是那样的没有兴趣，最后，通过穆洛姆卓瓦的眼睛看见他竟睡着了。接着，镜头转到耶尔硕夫的家，他从收音机里听完了音乐会的节目之后，疲倦地躺了下来。由于影片这样巧妙地运用了镜头的表现手段，在短短的几分钟里，通过这个十分平常的生活细节，把这三个人物的特性、爱好表现得这样深刻、鲜明！
    穆洛姆卓瓦形象的深刻、动人，在很大的程度上，应当归功于青年演员贝斯特里茨卡娅的演技。她真正深入了人物的心灵，领略了人物的感情、气质，并找到了展示这些感情、气质的最确切的表演手段，使你在那些最细小的方面，都能感触到人物的思想。她的每一个表情、动作，都使你感到真实。富有动作性的场面，不仅是编剧、导演创造的，而同时是、也应当是演员创造的。从贝斯特里茨卡娅的表演艺术中，我们看到的正是这样。
    而从贝斯特里茨卡娅的优秀的演技里，我们也深深地体会到：只有演员深入了角色，体察了人物的气质、个性和内心感情，并找到表达这些气质、个性和内心感情的最恰当、最确切的表情和动作手段，才能创造出生动、引人入胜的形象来。
    “苏联电影周”带来了苏联人民对于中国人民的深厚的情谊，也使中国电影工作者有了学习苏联电影艺术的好机会。
