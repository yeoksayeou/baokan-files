    "Gilding"
    Qin Weichong
    Recently, walking around Qianmenwai, I felt that this bustling commercial area has undergone great changes: Qianmen Street, Dashilan, and Xianyu Kou have all been renewed, and even the nationally famous Tongrentang, which has not been decorated for many years, is now dazzling. Many other shops are also vying to paint their facades. People say this is a new phenomenon that has emerged since the public-private partnership. In fact, this "new phenomenon" is not unique to Beijing; many cities have it.
    Along with this "new phenomenon," another situation has also emerged: there is an unusual shortage of painting workers, and shops wanting to paint their facades have to line up and register. The supply of paint is even tighter.
    "Gilding the face, steel for the blade," is an old folk saying that contains the meaning of "making the best use of everything," but also includes an element of satire for spending money inappropriately. If the facade of a merged shop is too dilapidated, it is not unreasonable to renovate it. However, if we do not first improve operations and better serve customers, using funds in the right places, but instead focus solely on decorating the facade and spending a lot of money, wouldn't that be putting the cart before the horse?
    Naturally, no one can deny that the public-private partnership stores have almost 100% achieved true "one price for all, no cheating the elderly or children," and the service attitude has also changed, making customers satisfied when they come and satisfied when they leave. However, some are inconsistent on the inside and out. Judging from the facades alone, they are all brightly colored and dazzling; but behind the paint and powder, there are still many things that are not satisfactory.
    In the past, private stores had some good traditions, such as delivering goods to the door, which have been painted over after the joint venture, even some basic things have been painted over. For example, customers are not allowed to choose what they buy, especially fruits. The minimum purchase amount has also increased, with sales only in units of half a jin or a jin. In the past, money was exchanged for goods directly, but now customers have to run to several counters. Sometimes, customers have to endure the suffering of "bundled sales." Furthermore, the administrative expenses of enterprises (excluding employee salaries) have increased more than in the past under the same circumstances, some even doubling, and so on.
    Of course, customers will look at the facade and the brand name before entering the door, but they are ultimately coming to buy something they like. Or, as some people say, painting the facade has three major benefits: first, it can enhance the beauty of the city; second, it can give people a comfortable feeling; and third, it can show a thriving atmosphere. This may be true. However, Yue Sheng Zhai's fame and attention are due to the unique flavor of its braised beef, and Dong Lai Shun's popularity is not because of the brilliance of its dimly lit upstairs and downstairs, but because of its hot pot.
    Let's put more effort into the "content"!

    “贴金”
    秦渭崇
    最近以来，到前门外走走，感到这个繁华的商业区有很大的变化：前门大街、大栅栏、鲜鱼口都焕然一新了，连全国著名的多年不修饰门面的同仁堂的门前，也光彩夺目了。还有许多商店，正在争相油饰门面。人们说这是公私合营以后出现的新气象。其实，这“新气象”不仅是北京，许多城市都有。
    随着这种“新气象”，也出现了另外一个情况：油漆彩画工人异常缺乏，要油饰门面的商店得排队挂号。涂料供应更加紧张。
    “有金贴在脸上，有钢使在刃上”，是民间流行的一句老话，其中包含有“物尽其用”的意思，也有讽刺钱用得不得当的成分。店铺合并，如果门面过于破旧，修饰一下，也未尝不可。但是如果不首先改善经营，更好地为顾客服务，把资金用在正当的地方，而一味注意装点门面，花去许多钱。这未免本末颠倒了吧！
    自然，谁也不能否认，公私合营了的商店，几乎是百分之百地做到了真正的“言不二价，童叟无欺”，服务态度也有了改变，使得顾客满意而来，满意而去。但是，有的却表里不一致。单从门面上去看，都是花红彩绿，耀眼眩目；而在那油饰粉刷的后面，却还有不少使人不能满意的东西。
    过去，私营商店有一些好的传统，如送货上门，在合营以后被涂刷掉了，就是连一些起码的东西，也被涂刷掉了。譬如说，买东西不让顾客挑选，尤其是水果之类。起售点也提高了，非半斤一斤不卖。过去是一手交钱一手交货，现在却要让顾客跑几个柜台。有时候，还要顾客吃“搭配”之苦。再如企业的行政管理费用（不包括职工薪资），在同样情形之下，比过去增多了，有的甚至增加了一倍以上，等等。
    当然，顾客固然在进门之前，会看看门面，看看字号，但他毕竟是要来买点称心的东西。或者像某些人说的，油饰门面有三大好处：一可以增加城市的美，二可以给人以舒适的感觉，三可以表现欣欣向荣的气象。这种说法也许是不错的。不过，月盛斋的出名，引人注目，还是因为它的酱牛肉有独特的美味，东来顺的招人喜欢，也并非因为它光线很暗的楼上楼下有什么光彩之处，而是在于它的涮锅子。
    还是多在“内容”上下点功夫吧！
