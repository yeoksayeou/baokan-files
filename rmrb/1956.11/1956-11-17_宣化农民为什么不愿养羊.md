    Why Farmers in Xuanhua are Unwilling to Raise Sheep

    Xuanhua is a mountainous area, and raising sheep is one of the main sideline occupations. However, in the past year or two, due to the particularly low price of sheep, the number of sheep has decreased significantly. Local people have made a calculation. They say: "The government buys our sheep, eats the meat for nothing, and still makes money; farmers buy a fur coat, give away four sheep for nothing and still have to add ten yuan." What is going on? It turns out that in the past, a castrated ram that could be slaughtered for 25 to 30 jin of meat would sell for 13 to 15 yuan, but now it can only sell for 6 to 8 yuan. Although the purchase price has recently been adjusted, it can only sell for 8.5 to 11.2 yuan, but the market price of mutton is 5 or 6 jiao per jin. Furthermore, sheepskins, when sold to the government, are only worth one yuan or 1.5 yuan each, at most two yuan each. But when the people want to buy them, a sheepskin costs at least six or seven yuan, and often eight yuan. Buying a medium-sized fur coat costs more than 35 yuan. Precisely because the purchase price is unreasonable, the people have adopted the method of slaughtering sheep to eat the meat themselves and sewing the skins into coats. Because slaughtering four sheep can make a fur coat, and the mutton is still eaten by themselves; if they sell the sheep to buy a fur coat, the mutton from four sheep is given away for nothing, and they still have to add ten yuan or so. It is hoped that the purchasing departments will study and solve this problem to benefit the development of animal husbandry. Shi Qingxiang

    宣化农民为什么不愿养羊
    宣化是一个山区，养羊为主要副业之一，可是近一、二年来由于羊价特别低，羊的数量减少很多。当地群众算了一笔账，他们说：“公家买我们的羊，白吃了肉，还赚了钱；农民买件皮袄，白贴四只羊还得搭十元钱。”这是怎么一回事呢？原来是这样：过去当地一只能杀二十五至三十斤肉的解子羊，每只卖十三至十五元，现在只能卖六至八元钱。近来虽然调整了收购价格，也只能卖八元五角到十一元二角，可是市场上每斤羊肉要卖五、六角钱一斤。再说羊皮，群众卖给公家，仅一元或一元五角一张，最多卖二元一张。群众要买进来呢，一张羊皮少者六、七元，多者八元，买一个半大皮袄就得三十五元多，正是因为收购价格不合理，群众都采取杀羊自吃肉、皮子缝袄穿的办法。因为杀四只羊就可以缝一个皮袄，羊肉还是自己吃；如果卖羊买皮袄，四只羊的羊肉就是白贴了，还得再贴十来元。这个问题希望采购部门研究解决，以利畜牧业的发展。　史庆祥
