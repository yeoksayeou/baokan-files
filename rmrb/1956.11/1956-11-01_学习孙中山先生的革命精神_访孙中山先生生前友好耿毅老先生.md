I recently interviewed Mr. Geng Yi, a longtime friend of Dr. Sun Yat-sen. He is currently a representative of the Hebei Provincial People's Congress and a Standing Committee member of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. He is over seventy years old.

Mr. Geng said, "Around the thirty-third year of the Guangxu reign (1907), the second year after the founding of the Tongmenghui (Chinese United League), I was a teacher at the Baoding Military Academy. That year, I joined the Tongmenghui and met Dr. Sun Yat-sen. Afterwards, I was always leading troops. When the Qing Dynasty was overthrown and the Republic of China was established, I served as the Chief of Staff of the Third Army. Although I continued to lead troops around, I had more opportunities to meet Dr. Sun Yat-sen than before. In total, I knew Dr. Sun Yat-sen for eighteen years. It would take too long to recount the historical process of Dr. Sun Yat-sen leading our revolution, so I will just share a few small stories to illustrate Dr. Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary will and his character." He added that because of his age, there might be discrepancies in the timing or details of some of the events he recounted.

He said: "I remember that when the October Revolution had just begun, Dr. Sun Yat-sen told us: This Russian revolution is a thorough revolution, and we in China should also carry out such a thorough revolution. Later, in 1922, Chen Jiongming rebelled and occupied Guangdong. At that time, many of us in Shanghai were disheartened. On October 10th of that year, Dr. Sun Yat-sen prepared a fine meal for us, with the aim of boosting morale. During the meal, he told us: Chen is insignificant, and we can eliminate him in a few months. The difficult task is building our country. We should take this opportunity to learn from the Soviet Union's politics and Germany's science to prepare for the construction of our motherland."

Mr. Geng said that in 1923, when they were living in Guangzhou, Dr. Sun Yat-sen proposed the policy of alliance with the Communist Party. At that time, there was great disagreement within the Kuomintang, and the debate was very fierce. There were three factions: one advocating for the inclusion of the Communists, one advocating for alliance with the Communists, and one advocating for separation from the Communists. Those who advocated for separation from the Communists were in the majority. Dr. Sun Yat-sen was very angry with this group. Later, in order to uphold the correct policy, he prepared travel expenses for these people and asked them to go home. Dr. Sun Yat-sen angrily told them: If I fail in my alliance with the Communists, I will ask you to come back. In order to carry out a thorough revolution, Dr. Sun Yat-sen did not hesitate to dismiss these close old subordinates and veterans of the Kuomintang. After that, Dr. Sun Yat-sen resolutely advocated the Three Great Policies of alliance with Russia, alliance with the Communist Party, and assistance to farmers and workers. In 1923, Dr. Sun Yat-sen and Soviet diplomat Adolf Joffe issued a joint declaration opposing imperialism.

Because Dr. Sun Yat-sen advocated alliance with Russia and the Communist Party, it aroused the displeasure of British imperialism. In 1924, the British government in Hong Kong bribed Chen Lianzhai, a comprador of the China HSBC Bank, and under the guise of organizing a merchant corps in Xiguan, Guangzhou, gathered a group of people and supplied them with three thousand guns from Britain, plotting to overthrow the Guangdong government. However, their conspiracy was quickly discovered, and the government immediately sent troops to disband the merchant corps. From then on, Dr. Sun Yat-sen was very resentful of British imperialism. Later, during Dr. Sun Yat-sen's last trip from Shanghai to Tianjin, because the passenger ships from Shanghai to Tianjin were all British ships, Dr. Sun Yat-sen resolutely refused to take a British ship and decided to detour through Japan to Tianjin.

Mr. Geng said: I and several other people accompanied Dr. Sun Yat-sen. We stayed in Kobe, Japan, for a week. From the first day Dr. Sun Yat-sen arrived there, the guests never stopped coming. Li Liejun, Dai Chuanxian, and six or seven of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's adjutants and I served as temporary receptionists. Dr. Sun Yat-sen met with guests in the morning, sometimes he was invited to give reports in the afternoon, and there were evening parties in the evening. Every day from seven in the morning until late at night, we had no rest. We made a special calculation that in one week, more than five thousand guests requested to see Dr. Sun Yat-sen, and Dr. Sun Yat-sen met with two or three hundred people. Because of such overwork, Dr. Sun Yat-sen could hardly support himself after visiting Zhang Zuolin in Tianjin for only ten minutes, and he fell ill after returning to his residence.

Mr. Geng paused for a moment and said, "There are many things we can learn from Dr. Sun Yat-sen. Take learning, for example. Dr. Sun Yat-sen was a lifelong learner, and he always had a book in his hand. When he was writing the 'Fundamentals of National Reconstruction,' he encountered many difficulties. He spread a large map of China on the floor and crawled there every day to carefully look at, think about, and study it. He would ask others for advice on things he did not understand. He studied diligently like this, spent two or three years, and finally completed the 'Fundamentals of National Reconstruction'." The old gentleman continued, "I also heard Cao Yabai of the Tongmenghui tell me that after Dr. Sun Yat-sen was imprisoned in England, his life was very difficult. Cao Yabai was studying in England at the time and often provided Dr. Sun Yat-sen with money for food, but Dr. Sun Yat-sen used the money for food to buy books and studied diligently every day."

Mr. Geng also told a moving story about Dr. Sun Yat-sen: After the Xinhai Revolution began, Dr. Sun Yat-sen returned to Shanghai from England. At that time, Huang Xing and others were preparing to raise funds to establish a government in Nanjing. When they heard that Dr. Sun Yat-sen had returned, they thought that Dr. Sun Yat-sen would definitely bring back some money. However, after they met with Dr. Sun Yat-sen, Dr. Sun Yat-sen told them: I did not bring back a penny. I brought you the revolutionary spirit. Later, Dr. Sun Yat-sen also said: Our revolution does not rely on money. With the revolutionary spirit, anything can be done.

    学习孙中山先生的革命精神
    访孙中山先生生前友好耿毅老先生
    新华社记者　郝秀岚
    记者最近访问了孙中山先生生前的友好耿毅老先生。他现在是河北省人民代表大会代表、政协河北省委员会常务委员。他已经七十多岁了。
    耿老先生说：“大约是光绪三十三年，同盟会成立的第二年，我那时在保定陆军学校当教员，就在这一年我加入了同盟会，也就认识了中山先生。以后我一直是带队伍。推翻满清政府、成立中华民国的时候，我作第三军参谋长。以后我虽然还是带着队伍各处去，但是和中山先生见面的机会就比过去多了，算起来我和中山先生相识有十八年之久。如果要讲起中山先生领导我们革命的历史过程就太长了，我只说几件小事情看看中山先生的革命意志和他的为人吧”。他又说，因为年纪大了，他讲的有些事的时间或细节上可能会有出入。
    他说：我记得，十月革命刚开始，中山先生对我们说过：俄国这次革命才是彻底的革命，我们中国也应该这样彻底搞革命。以后，在1922年，陈炯明叛变占领了广东，当时我们在上海许多人情绪沮丧，就在这年10月10日，中山先生预备了很好的饭菜请我们吃，目的是鼓舞士气。吃饭的时候他对我们说：陈不足势，有几个月功夫我们就可以消灭他，困难的事是建设我们的国家，我们应该趁此机会很好的学习苏联的政治、学习德国的科学，为建设祖国准备力量。
    耿老先生说，1923年我们住在广州的时候，中山先生提出联共政策，当时国民党内部意见极不一致，争论很激烈，共分了三派，一派主张容共，一派主张联共，还有一派主张分共，主张分共的人占多数，中山先生对主张分共的这部分人很气愤，以后他为了坚持正确政策，给这部分人准备了路费，请他们回家去，中山先生气愤地对他们说：我如有联共失败的那一天再去请你们。中山先生为了彻底革命，不惜断然辞退他这些亲密的老部下、国民党的元老。此后，中山先生就坚决主张联俄、联共、扶助农工的三大政策，1923年中山先生和苏联外交使节越飞发表了联合宣言，共同反对帝国主义。
    正因为中山先生主张联俄、联共，以后引起了英帝国主义的反感。1924年，香港英国政府买通了中国汇丰银行买办陈莲斋，在广州西关借组织商团为名，集聚一部分人，由英国供给三千支枪，策划推翻广东政府。可是他们的阴谋很快就被发现，政府立刻去军队把商团解散了。从此以后，中山先生对英帝国主义非常痛恨。以后，也就是中山先生最后一次由上海往天津去的那次，因为当时由上海到天津的水路客船都是英国船，先生就坚决不乘英船，决定绕道日本去天津。
    耿老先生说：我和另外几个人跟随先生同行，我们在日本神户住了一个星期。从先生到这里的第一天起，客人就始终没断，我和李烈钧、戴传贤还有中山先生的副官六、七个人，作了临时招待员，先生上午会客，下午有时被请出去作报告，晚间还有晚会，每天从早上七点开始直到深夜，不得休息。我们特别作了一下统计，一个星期的工夫，要求会见先生的客人有五千多人，先生会见了二、三百人。就因为这样过度疲劳，先生到天津后拜会了张作霖，只谈了十来分钟的话就难支持了，回到住所后就病倒了。
    耿老先生沉默了一会说：“中山先生值得我们学习的地方很多，就拿学习这件事说吧，先生终生好学，无论何时手不离卷。他作建国方略的时候，曾经碰到很多困难。他在地上铺一张中国大地图，每天爬在那里仔细地看、思考、研究，不懂的地方就向别人请教，他这样苦心钻研，花了两三年的工夫，终于把建国方略写成了。”老先生接着说：“我还听同盟会的曹亚柏告诉我，先生在英国那次被囚出来后，生活非常困苦，曹亚柏当时在英国读书，经常接济中山先生吃饭的钱，可是中山先生把吃饭的钱都买了书，每天刻苦学习。”
    耿老先生还讲了中山先生一件令人感动的事：辛亥革命开始后，先生从英国回到上海，当时黄兴等人正准备筹款在南京成立政府，听说中山先生回来，他们以为先生一定能带回一些钱。可是他们和先生见面以后，中山先生告诉他们：我一个钱也没带回来，我给你们带来了革命精神。以后，中山先生还说：“我们革命不是靠钱，有了革命精神什么事都可以作了。”
