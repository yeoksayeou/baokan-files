Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, November 2nd: The Hanoi newspapers today published a communique from the Council of Ministers of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, stating that the Council of Ministers held a meeting last week chaired by President Ho Chi Minh to discuss three issues: land reform and organizational rectification, development of the democratic system, and improvement of the people's livelihood. The meeting formulated specific policies for correcting errors in land reform and organizational rectification work, and for promoting the achievements of these works.

Regarding land reform and organizational rectification, the communique stated that the Council of Ministers decided that, from now on, the central and local land reform committees at all levels would only be research organs directly under the governments at each level, and would no longer have leadership power.

The Council of Ministers decided to abolish the Special People's Tribunals.

The Council of Ministers decided to give the following punishments to Ho Viet Thang and Le Van Luong, who made serious mistakes in directly guiding the land reform and organizational rectification work: 1. Dismiss Ho Viet Thang from his positions as Deputy Director and Standing Committee Member of the Central Land Reform Committee, and order him to resign from his position as Deputy Minister of Agriculture and Forestry. 2. Approve Le Van Luong's resignation from his positions as Deputy Minister of Interior and Director of the Internal Affairs Office of the Premier's Office.

The communique pointed out that Vietnam has basic favorable conditions for correcting some of the errors that have recently emerged. The Party and the government have taken urgent measures to make preliminary corrections to the errors that have been discovered. At present, the error correction work in some places has begun to show results, giving the people confidence. However, the rural situation in many places is still very complicated, and it is necessary to formulate comprehensive policies to continue the correction.

The communique also stated that other specific policies related to correcting errors, in addition to those that have already been announced, will continue to be announced in the future.

The communique also emphasized that while correcting errors in land reform, it is necessary to promote work in all aspects, especially production work.

    越南部长会议制定改进工作具体政策
    决定整顿土地改革组织继续纠正偏差
    新华社河内2日电　今天河内各报发表越南民主共和国政府部长会议的公报说，部长会议在上星期由胡志明主席主持举行会议，讨论了关于土地改革和整顿组织、发展民主制度、改善人民生活等三个问题，并且就纠正土地改革和整顿组织工作的错误和发扬这些工作的成就定出了具体的政策。
    关于土地改革和整顿组织问题，公报说，部长会议决定，从现在起，中央和地方的各级土地改革委员会只是直属于各级政权的研究机关，不再有领导权。
    部长会议决定取消特别人民法庭。
    部长会议决定给予直接指导土地改革和整顿组织工作中犯了严重错误的胡曰胜和黎文良二人以如下处分：一、解除胡曰胜中央土地改革委员会副主任和常务委员的职务，着令辞去农林部副部长的职务。二、批准黎文良辞去内务部副部长和总理府内政办公室主任的职务。
    公报指出，越南有着基本的有利条件纠正最近出现的一些错误。党和政府已经采取紧急措施对已经发现的错误进行初步的纠正。目前，有些地方的纠偏工作已经开始有了结果，使人民有了信心。但是，许多地方的农村情况还很复杂，必须制定全面的政策，继续进行纠正。
    公报又说，除了已经公布的以外，有关改正错误的其他具体政策将要在以后继续公布。
    公报还强调指出，必须在纠正土地改革等错误的同时，推进各方面的工作，尤其是生产工作。
