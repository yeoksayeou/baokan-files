    Let Workers Understand Ethnic Policies
    Shen Shi
    A large number of workers and staff have been newly added to the Karamay Mining Bureau. Among them are skilled workers from Shanghai, Baoji, and Yumen, demobilized and transferred soldiers from Shandong, and farmers and students from Yili and Kashi.
    The increase in new workers has made the work of the mining bureau more arduous. How to enable them to learn the technology in a short period of time, and how to unite the workers of several ethnic groups to develop the Karamay oil field, the heads of the mining bureau are indeed racking their brains.
    When workers of several ethnic groups live together, there are bound to be some gaps in their contact due to different languages, mutual unfamiliarity with customs, and little knowledge of ethnic policies. In workshops and drilling teams, some Han workers who are skilled in technology are not patiently teaching technical knowledge to minority workers. The water for drinking in the Karamay oil area is transported by truck from 40 kilometers away. Before and after work, groups of people line up at the boiling water pool. Some Han workers who get the iron ladle to scoop water are often unwilling to hand the iron ladle to minority workers. Similarly, some minority workers, after filling the water, are often unwilling to hand the iron ladle to Han workers. Some Han workers say: "Minority workers are afraid of toughness and should be dealt with in a tough way." Some Han workers believe that "Minority workers like to drink and fight, it's best to avoid them." Obviously, this abnormal situation shows that there are still gaps between Han and minority workers, and that some Han workers still have Han chauvinist ideas. If this situation is allowed to continue, it will not be conducive to the development of the Karamay oil field.
    In order to enable workers of several ethnic groups to live together in close unity and to gradually eliminate emotional gaps, the Karamay Mining Bureau needs to regularly check the implementation of ethnic policies in a planned way, needs to educate new workers on ethnic policies, and patiently help those workers with Han chauvinist ideas, so that every technically skilled Han worker understands that training minority workers is their bounden duty.
    Karamay is a newly discovered oil field, starting from scratch. All kinds of work are complex and the exploration area is vast and scattered. All materials have to be transported from afar, and the lives of workers are quite difficult. This requires the leaders of the mining bureau and its affiliated organizations to go deep into the workers and understand their hardships. They are doing just that. Recently, Zhang Wenbin, Director of the Xinjiang Petroleum Administration, and Wang Qiren, Secretary of the Party Committee, have gone deep into the Karamay oil area to inspect winter insulation and safety production and other work, and have solved many problems. The director of the Karamay Mining Bureau and the First Secretary of the Party Committee, etc., went to various engineering sections and were welcomed by the workers. The workers hope that this good style can be maintained.
    When dealing with problems that arise between minority workers, the Karamay Mining Bureau lets minority cadres come forward to solve them. However, at present, there are not many minority leaders assigned to various departments of the Mining Bureau. For example, in the Karamay Mining Bureau Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, there are very few minority members. However, minority workers account for one-third of the total number of workers. It is hoped that the relevant parties will gradually resolve this issue.

    让职工懂得民族政策
    沈石
    克拉玛依矿务局新添了大批工人和职员。他们当中，有的是从上海、宝鸡、玉门来的技术工人，有的是从山东来的复员转业军人，有的是从伊犁、喀什来的农民和学生。
    新工人增加，使得矿务局的工作也随着繁重起来，怎样使他们在短期内学会技术，怎样使几个民族成份的职工团结在一起来开发克拉玛依大油田，矿务局的负责人的确煞费心事。
    几个民族的职工生活在一起，由于语言不同，由于互不了解风俗习惯，由于很少学过民族政策，他们接触当中，不免有些隔阂。在车间和钻井队里，技术熟练的汉族工人，有的还不是耐心地将技术知识教给少数民族工人。克拉玛依油区饮用的水，是从四十公里外用汽车运来的，在上班之前，下班之后，成群的人列队在开水池边。有些汉族工人拿到舀水的铁杓，舀完了水，往往不愿意将铁杓递给少数民族工人。同样，有些少数民族工人装满水后，也往往不愿将铁杓递给汉族工人。某些汉族工人说：“少数民族工人怕硬，应该用硬的方式来对付。”有的汉族工人认为“少数民族工人好酗酒，好打架，最好少惹他们。”显然，这种不正常的情况，说明汉族和少数民族工人之间还有着隔阂，说明某些汉族职工还有着大汉族主义思想。如果让这种情况继续下去，是不利于克拉玛依油田的开发的。
    要使几个民族的职工亲密团结地生活在一起，要逐渐消除感情上的隔阂，克拉玛依矿务局需要有计划地定期地检查民族政策执行的情况，需要对新来的职工进行民族政策的教育，对那些有着大汉族主义思想的工人，要耐心地帮助他们，使每一个技术熟练的汉族工人懂得培养少数民族工人是自己应尽的职责。
    克拉玛依是新发现的油田，平地起家，种种工作，千头万绪，而探区辽阔分散，一切物资都得从远道运来，职工的生活是相当艰苦的。这就需要矿务局及所属机构的负责人，深入到工人中去，了解他们的疾苦。他们正是这样做的，最近，新疆石油管理局局长张文彬、党委书记王其人，先后深入到克拉玛依油区，检查冬季保温防寒和安全生产等工作，解决了许多问题。而克拉玛依矿务局局长和党委第一书记等下到各工程段，受到了工人们的欢迎。这种好的作风，工人们希望能够坚持下去。
    在处理少数民族职工之间发生的问题时，克拉玛依矿务局是让少数民族干部去出面解决。然而，目前矿务局所属各部门配备的少数民族的负责人还不多。例如在中共克拉玛依矿务局委员会里，少数民族成份的委员就寥寥无几。而少数民族工人要占工人总数三分之一。这个问题希望有关方面逐步的予以解决。
