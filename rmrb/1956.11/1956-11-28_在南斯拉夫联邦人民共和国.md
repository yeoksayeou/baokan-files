In the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia
    Industrial Development, Export Growth
    The Yugoslav Federal Bureau of Statistics recently announced that Yugoslavia's industrial production in the first ten months of this year increased by 9% compared to the same period last year. Among them, the paper industry increased by 41%, the chemical industry increased by 20%, and the production of iron smelting, electricity, food, tobacco, and building materials also increased. Due to the good completion of the industrial production plan in the past few months, the total industrial output this year can be increased by about 10% compared to last year.
    In the first ten months of this year, Yugoslavia's export trade also increased. It is estimated that by the end of this year, the total export value will reach 95 billion dinars (Yugoslav currency), which greatly exceeds last year's total export value. This year, Yugoslavia exports goods to seventy-five countries, an increase of twenty-four countries compared to 1953. It is expected that exports next year will increase by another 15% to 20% compared to this year.
    Plan for Peaceful Use of Atomic Energy
    A plan for the peaceful use of atomic energy is being formulated in Yugoslavia. In agriculture, one of the main tasks will be to increase crop yields by irradiating seeds, and to create methods for the practical application of isotopes in agriculture. Research centers will be established in agricultural research institutions to study the application of radioactive isotopes.
    In industrial production, consideration will be given to using radioactive isotopes to control the production processes of rubber, glass, paper, tin, and metallurgical products. Industrial technology research institutions will conduct large-scale scientific research work in the peaceful use of atomic energy.
    At the end of November this year, a special committee will be established to utilize radioactive isotopes in medicine. According to the plan, the experience gained in the prevention and treatment of cancer will be applied first.
    Developing New Coal Mines
    A coal mine estimated to contain 500 million tons of brown coal has recently been discovered in Konjščina, near Zagreb in northwestern Yugoslavia. Work on exploiting this coal mine will begin soon. The Yugoslav government will allocate 1.4 billion dinars (approximately US$4.6 million) to build three new mine shafts and mechanize mining operations. At the same time, a railway will be built to connect the mine to nearby transportation lines. It is estimated that about 600,000 tons of brown coal can be extracted from this coal mine each year.
    In eastern Yugoslavia, a brown coal mine with reserves of 4.5 billion tons, after a long period of preparation, is about to be mined. The coal output in the first phase of this mine is estimated to reach 2.5 million tons, almost half of the average annual output of brown coal in Yugoslavia in the past five years.
    Ten Thousand Ton Freighter Newly Launched
    The freighter "Radnik," built by the "May 3rd" shipyard in Rijeka, Yugoslavia, has recently been launched and will regularly sail between Yugoslavia and North America. This freighter has a deadweight of over 10,000 tons, is 146 meters long, and can travel at a speed of 10 knots per hour.
    "Radnik" is Yugoslavia's large freighter equipped with domestically produced engines. These engines are produced by the Karlovac engine factory in the Socialist Republic of Croatia, Yugoslavia. This factory can now manufacture 4,200 horsepower engines. Following "Radnik," Yugoslavia is also building two more freighters of the same type.
    Largest Thermal Power Plant Starts Supplying Electricity
    Yugoslavia's newly built largest thermal power plant has begun supplying electricity.
    This power plant is located in Čatići, Bosnia. The first two steam generators of the power plant have a total generating capacity of 64,000 kilowatts, and they will be able to generate 360 million kilowatt-hours of electricity annually. There are also plans to install four more generators. (Picture attached)

    在南斯拉夫联邦人民共和国
    工业发展，出口增长
    南斯拉夫联邦统计局最近宣布，今年头十个月南斯拉夫的工业生产已比去年同期增加了9％。其中造纸工业增加了41％，化学工业增加了20％，炼铁、电力、食品、烟草和建筑材料等工业部门的生产也有了增加。由于过去几个月的工业生产计划完成得好，今年工业的总产量将可以比去年增加10％左右。
    在今年头十个月内，南斯拉夫的出口贸易也有了增长。预计到今年年底，出口总额将达到九百五十亿第纳尔（南币名），大大地超过去年的出口总额。南斯拉夫今年向七十五个国家输出商品，这比1953年增加了二十四个国家，预料明年的出口将比今年再增加15％到20％。
    和平利用原子能的计划
    一个和平利用原子能的计划正在南斯拉夫制定中。在农业方面，主要的任务之一将是通过对种子进行放射性照射来提高农作物的产量，同时要创造出在农业中实际运用同位素的方法。在农业研究机构中将设立研究中心，以便研究放射性同位素的应用。
    在工业生产中，将考虑利用放射性同位素来控制橡胶、玻璃、纸张、锡和冶金产品的生产过程。工业技术研究机构将在和平利用原子能方面进行大规模的科学研究工作。
    今年11月底，将成立一个在医学方面利用放射性同位素的专门委员会。根据计划，在防治癌症方面所取得的经验将被首先应用。
    开发新的煤矿
    在南斯拉夫西北部萨格勒布附近的康夫西地方最近发现了一个估计蕴藏有五亿吨褐煤的煤矿。开采这个煤矿的工作最近就要开始。南斯拉夫政府将拨款一十四亿第纳尔（约合四百六十万美元）用来建设三个新的矿井和使采矿工作机械化。同时还要建筑一条使这个矿井同附近的运输线连接起来的铁路。据估计，从这个煤矿每年将能开采约六十万吨的褐煤。
    在南斯拉夫东部，一个蕴藏量达四十五亿吨的褐煤矿，经过长时间的准备以后，最近也要开采。这个煤矿在第一阶段的采煤量估计就可以达到二百五十万吨，差不多等于过去五年内南斯拉夫褐煤平均年产量的一半。
    万吨货轮新近下水
    南斯拉夫里耶卡“5月3日”造船厂所建造的一艘货船“拉德尼克”号最近已经下水，它将经常驶行于南斯拉夫和北美之间。这艘货船载重量在一万吨以上，长一百四十六公尺，每小时能航行十浬。
    “拉德尼克”号是南斯拉夫装有本国出产的发动机的大型货船。这种发动机是南斯拉夫克罗地亚人民共和国卡尔洛瓦奇发动机制造厂出产的。这个工厂现在可以制造四千二百马力的发动机。继“拉德尼克”号之后，南斯拉夫还在建造另外二艘同样类型的货船。
    最大火力发电厂开始供电
    南斯拉夫新建的最大的火力发电厂已经开始供电。
    这个发电厂位于波斯尼亚的察提契。发电厂的头两个蒸汽发电机的发电能力共有六万四千瓩，它们每年将可以发出三亿六千万度的电力。另外还计划要安装四部发电机。（附图片）
