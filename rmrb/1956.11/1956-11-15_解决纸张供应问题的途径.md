Ways to Solve the Paper Supply Problem
By a Commentator of this Newspaper

With the increasing development of socialist construction, the demand for paper from all sectors is growing. Due to the increase in the circulation of newspapers and books, the national consumption of newsprint and offset paper this year has increased by more than 40% compared to last year. Rural areas, which used to consume very little paper, have also become an important market for paper after cooperativization. According to statistics from the suburbs of Shanghai and Zhejiang Province, each advanced cooperative needs an average of about 120 kilograms of paper for bookkeeping and office use each year; primary cooperatives need about 50 kilograms. In total, the national demand for civilian paper this year has increased by more than 56% compared to last year. The demand for some industrial paper has increased even more. This year, the demand for cement bag paper has increased by 65% compared to last year, blueprint photosensitive base paper has increased by 36% compared to last year, and various electrical papers have increased by 4.7 times compared to last year.

In the past seven years, the growth rate of paper production in our country has also been relatively fast. In 1950, the country produced more than 140,000 tons of machine-made paper, which has increased to 705,000 tons this year. Due to the growth of domestic machine-made paper production, imports of foreign paper have gradually decreased. However, the social demand is growing faster than paper production, so since the end of last year, the supply of various types of paper has become increasingly tight. In the future, economic and cultural undertakings will further develop, and many new industrial sectors will need more varieties of industrial paper. To overcome the difficulties of paper shortage, it is necessary to conserve paper in all aspects. At present, the phenomenon of wasting paper, especially in publishing and printing, is quite serious, which is an important reason for the current tight paper supply situation. First of all, there are many more newspapers and periodicals in recent years, and the amount of paper used is also the largest. Many newspapers and periodicals not only repeatedly reprint the same articles, but also often add pages, causing a lot of waste. Secondly, the unplanned distribution of books also causes a lot of waste. For example, the novel "On the Fields, Forward!" was printed 440,000 copies at once, and 120,000 copies have not been sold yet; for another example, there are more than 20 publishing houses repeatedly publishing a book on how to raise pigs with similar content; for another example, the eight key books published by the Popular Reading Publishing House in large quantities last winter and spring totaled 4.82 million copies, and 3.22 million copies are still in stock. Thirdly, government agencies and organizations indiscriminately print and distribute internal publications. These wasteful phenomena must be eliminated. We must fully recognize that saving paper is a very important aspect of solving the paper supply problem.

However, in order to gradually meet the growing actual needs, it is also necessary to take measures to increase paper production.

Taking necessary technical measures to improve equipment in existing paper-making enterprises is an important way to increase paper production. In the past seven years, the output of machine-made paper has increased fourfold, which is basically achieved by existing enterprises tapping production potential through various methods. Of course, it is necessary to continue to tap potential in the future. However, many of these enterprises have very old equipment, and to further tap potential, it is necessary to take appropriate technical measures in a timely manner. Facts have proved that taking timely technical measures does not cost much and yields significant results. For example, the state-owned Shixian Paper Mill recently adjusted individual equipment of two paper machines, and the production efficiency of these two machines increased by 7% to 8%. However, in the past, due to cumbersome approval procedures and often lengthy approval times, coupled with insufficient materials and design strength, many factories' technical measures could not be carried out in a timely manner, which greatly limited the potential of existing enterprises. The Paper Industry Administration has recently appropriately decentralized the power to control funds for technical measures, and will provide factories with technical assistance in the future.

Due to the large distance between supply and sales, relying solely on existing enterprises is still not enough to meet the needs. To greatly increase paper production and solve the urgent need for newsprint, industrial packaging paper, and industrial technical paper, it is also necessary to strive for new and expanded paper-making enterprises to put into production as soon as possible.

Recently, the lack of supply of equipment and materials has added many difficulties to the capital construction and technical measures of the paper industry. For example, the expansion project of the Guangzhou Paper Mill installed a paper machine in July this year, but it did not start trial production until now due to the lack of some parts. Many factories' technical measures cannot be implemented even with money because they cannot buy equipment and materials. In order to reduce accidents and ensure normal operation, it is necessary to strengthen the maintenance and repair of existing equipment. At present, old factories generally have boiler problems. Most boilers have exceeded their service life, and some have exceeded their capacity and need to be repaired and replaced quickly. Some factories also need to appropriately increase them, which requires finding ways to solve the supply of equipment and materials. Paper-making equipment is a relatively complex heavy machinery. An integrated pulp and paper factory with an annual output of 50,000 tons requires machines weighing seven or eight thousand tons. It is different from the equipment of general light industry, and it is impossible without specialized manufacturing factories. At present, China's paper-making machinery manufacturing industry is still relatively weak and cannot produce complete sets of paper-making equipment; paper machines with a daily output of more than 50 tons are also just beginning to be manufactured. The machinery industry department should appropriately strengthen the production of paper-making equipment. The paper industry department should also appropriately strengthen the strength and equipment of the repair shops and maintain a certain reserve of equipment and materials to ensure the timely implementation of technical measures and maintenance work.

Another important issue in greatly increasing paper production is the supply of raw materials. At present, the problem of insufficient paper-making raw materials, especially wood pulp, has begun to become prominent. The Shanghai Paper Company is short of more than 1,500 tons of wood pulp in the fourth quarter of this year; more than 800 tons of reed pulp; the three state-owned paper mills in Jilin, Shixian, and Kaishantun are also short of 49,000 cubic meters of timber reserves that should have been available this year. Many local state-owned paper mills have also experienced the problem of insufficient pulp.

In the political report made at the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, Comrade Liu Shaoqi pointed out that in 1962, the output of machine-made paper was required to increase from the original plan of 650,000 tons in 1957 to 1.5 million to 1.6 million tons. However, there is now a shortage of paper-making raw materials. If the responsible departments of the forestry industry and the paper industry do not make long-term plans as soon as possible, the raw material problem will become more and more serious. In order to adapt to the needs of increasing paper production, on the one hand, it is necessary to build some pulp-making factories in the main producing areas of various raw materials; on the other hand, it is necessary to reach agreements with relevant parties and make long-term plans for raw material supply. The raw material supply department should also guarantee it according to the plan.

Some paper, such as newsprint and some industrial paper, must be made of wood pulp, and other paper must also be mixed with a certain proportion of wood pulp. At present, wood pulp only accounts for 29.5% of the entire pulp used in machine-made paper. If the proportion of wood pulp is further reduced, it may affect the quality of the paper. At present, the proportion of timber used for paper-making in the entire timber felling volume is only 5%, which needs to be appropriately increased, but our country is also a country with insufficient forest resources. Therefore, in order to adapt to the development of the paper industry, it is recommended that the forestry department consider planning to build some paper-making forests.

An important method to make up for the shortage of wood pulp is to use more reeds and bamboo to make paper, but there are also problems in this regard. The fundamental problem is the lack of unified leadership. Reed marshes lack management and rely entirely on natural growth. Especially after agricultural cooperativization, some places one-sidedly emphasized grain production and turned reed marshes into grain fields; even the Panjin Reed Farm, which was originally operated by the Paper Industry Bureau, has also had some reed marshes turned into rice paddies since it was transferred to the Liaoning Provincial Department of Agriculture last year. In recent years, the output and quality of reeds have shown a downward trend. The production of bamboo is also the same. Reeds and bamboo are important raw materials for the paper-making industry, the construction industry, and the handicraft weaving industry. When arranging agricultural and sideline production, all localities should treat them as an economic crop; and make comprehensive development plans for reed marshes and farmland, bamboo mountains and forests. At present, the procedures for purchasing bamboo and reeds are too cumbersome and there are too many links, which makes the purchase price too low. The purchase links should be reduced as much as possible and the purchase price should be adjusted to benefit farmers' production.

Currently, the utilization of waste materials is also insufficient. For example, shoe soles, rags, waste paper, cotton stalks, wheat straw, bagasse, and rice straw are all usable paper-making raw materials. Especially shoe soles and rags, according to the experience of the two state-owned paper mills in Shandong and Taiyuan, the fiber of rag pulp is better than wood pulp, and the cost is lower than wood pulp. Unfortunately, the purchase and utilization are not enough. There is also *龙须草* (literally "dragon beard grass") in Sichuan, Hubei, and other provinces, the fiber is longer than bamboo and reeds, and it can also be used to make paper. The paper industry department should strengthen research and development to open up new sources of raw materials.

In order to supplement the shortage of machine-made paper, the production of handmade paper should also be developed. Our country has a long history of handmade paper production. For example, Anhui's Xuan paper, Zhejiang's bark paper, Fujian's Lian Shi paper and Mao Bian paper, various papers in Jiangxi and Hunan, and the sanitary paper produced in large quantities in various places are all very popular. In the past few years, the output of handmade paper has been more than 200,000 tons per year, accounting for about 30% of the total paper production in the country, and has replaced machine-made paper in many aspects to meet social needs. However, handmade paper production cooperatives and groups generally lack funds, are technologically backward, and cannot increase output. In addition, there are some problems with the purchase price, and the income of paper-making workers is very low. The income of skilled paper-making workers is not even as high as that of ordinary members of agricultural cooperatives. As a result, handmade paper-making workers have switched to other industries, and the output of handmade paper has shown a downward trend since last year. The Central Handicraft Industry Administration and the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives should jointly study with the agricultural production departments in various places and quickly solve the problems of funds, wages, and purchase prices of handmade paper production cooperatives and groups; the Paper Industry Administration should make long-term plans and annual plans for the production of handmade paper, and provide technical guidance and assistance. If we do save paper in all aspects and actively take concrete measures to increase paper production (including handmade paper production), the tight paper supply situation will gradually change.

    解决纸张供应问题的途径
    本报评论员
    随着社会主义建设的日益发展，各方面对纸张的需求越来越大。由于报刊书籍发行量增多，今年全国新闻纸和凸板纸的消费量，比去年增长了40％以上。过去用纸很少的农村，在合作化以后，也变成纸张的重要市场。据上海郊区和浙江省的统计，每个高级社平均每年约需记账和办公用纸一百二十公斤；初级社也要五十公斤左右。总计今年全国民用纸张的需要量比去年增长了56％以上。有些工业用纸的需要量增加得更多。今年，水泥袋纸的需要量比去年增加65％，晒图感光原纸比去年增加36％，各种电器用纸比去年增加四点七倍。
    七年来，我国纸张生产增长的速度也是比较快的。1950年全国生产了十四万多吨机制纸，今年已经增长到七十万五千吨。由于本国机制纸生产的增长，国外进口纸张已经逐步减少。但是，社会需要量比纸张生产量增长得更快，因此，从去年年底以来，各种纸张的供应，一天比一天紧张。今后，经济、文化事业将要进一步发展，许多新的工业部门都需要更多品种的工业用纸，为了克服纸张不足的困难，必须从各方面节约用纸。目前，用纸方面特别是出版印刷方面浪费纸张的现象是相当严重的，这是造成目前纸张供应紧张情况的一个重要原因。首先是报纸和刊物，近年来增加很多，用纸数量也最大。很多报纸和刊物，不仅反复转载同一文章，而且经常加张，造成很大浪费。其次是图书发行的计划不周，也造成很大浪费。如“在田野上，前进！”这本小说，一次就印了四十四万册，到现在还有十二万册没有卖出去；又如内容类似的怎样养猪一书，有二十多个出版社重复出版；又如通俗读物出版社去冬今春大量印行的八种重点书，总共印了四百八十二万册，到现在还积压了三百二十二万册。其次是机关、团体滥印滥发内部刊物。这些浪费现象，必须努力消除。我们必须充分认识节约用纸是解决纸张供应问题的一个很重要的方面。
    但是，为了逐步满足日益增长的实际需要，还需要采取增产纸张的措施。
    在现有造纸企业中采取必要的改进设备的技术措施，是增产纸张的一个重要途径。七年来，机制纸的产量增长了四倍，基本上是依靠现有企业采取各种办法挖掘生产潜力得到的，今后当然需要继续挖掘潜力。但是，这些企业许多设备都很陈旧了，要进一步挖掘潜力，必须及时采取适当的技术措施。事实证明，及时采取技术措施，花钱不多，收效显著。如国营石岘造纸厂最近调整了两台造纸机的个别设备，这两台机器的生产效率就提高了7％到8％。可是，过去由于批审手续太烦，批审时间往往拖得很长，加以某些材料不足，设计力量不够，许多工厂的技术措施不能及时进行，大大地限制了现有企业潜力的发挥。造纸工业管理局最近已经把掌握技术措施经费的权力，适当地下放了，今后还要在技术上给予工厂帮助。
    由于供销之间的距离相差太大，仅仅依靠现有企业，还是不能满足需要的。要大量增产纸张，解决急需的新闻纸、工业包装用纸、工业技术用纸的问题还必须争取新建、扩建的造纸企业早日投入生产。
    近来，器材设备供应不上，给造纸工业的基本建设和技术措施增加了不少困难。如广州造纸厂的扩建工程今年7月就安装了抄纸机，只是因为缺乏部分零件，直到现在才试车生产。许多厂的技术措施，有了钱也买不到器材。为了减少事故，保证正常运转，对现有设备要加强维护和检修，现在，老厂普遍发生了锅炉问题，一般锅炉都超过了使用期，有的已经超过能量，需要赶快检修、更换，有的厂还要适当增加，这就要设法解决器材供应问题。造纸设备是比较复杂的重型机械，一个年产五万吨的制浆造纸综合工厂，所需机器重达七八千吨。它和一般的轻工业的设备不同，没有专业的制造工厂是不行的。目前，我国造纸机械制造工业，还相当薄弱，还不能生产成套的造纸设备；日产五十吨纸以上的抄纸机，也还刚刚开始制造。机械工业部门应该适当加强造纸设备的生产。造纸工业部门也要适当充实修配车间的力量和设备，并且保持一定的器材储备，以保证技术措施和检修工作的及时进行。
    大量增产纸张还有一个重要问题，就是原料的供应。现在，造纸原料特别是木浆不足的问题，已经开始突出了。上海造纸公司今年第四季度就缺少木浆一千五百多吨；苇浆八百多吨；吉林、石岘、开山屯等三个国营造纸厂，今年应有的木材储备量也少四万九千立方公尺。许多地方国营造纸厂，也发生了纸浆不够的问题。
    刘少奇同志在党的第八次全国代表大会上所作的政治报告中指出，在1962年，要求机制纸的产量由1957年原计划的六十五万吨增加到一百五十至一百六十万吨。而造纸原料现在就感不足，森林工业和造纸工业的主管部门如果不及早作出长远的规划，原料问题还会越来越严重。为了适应增产纸张的需要，一方面要在各种原料的主要产地，筹建一些制浆工厂；另方面要同有关方面取得协议，作出原料供应的远景规划。原料供应部门也应该按计划加以保证。
    有些纸，如新闻纸和部分工业用纸是非用木浆制造不行的，其他纸张也必须搭配一定比例的木浆。而现在，机制纸所用木浆只占整个用浆的29.5％，如果还要减轻木浆的配比，就可能要影响纸的质量。目前，造纸用材在整个林木采伐量中所占的比例，只有5％，需要有适当的增加，但我国又是一个森林资源不足的国家，因此为了适应造纸工业的发展，建议林业部门考虑有计划地营造一些造纸林。
    弥补木浆不足的一个重要方法，是多利用芦苇和竹子造纸，可是这方面目前也存在问题。根本问题在于没有统一领导。苇塘缺乏经营管理，完全依靠自然成长，特别是在农业合作化以后，有些地方片面强调粮食增产，把苇塘开成了粮田；甚至像原归造纸局经营的盘锦苇场，自从去年拨归辽宁省农业厅以后，也有部分苇塘被开成稻田。近年来，苇子的产量质量都有下降的趋势。竹子的生产，也是这样。芦苇和竹子是造纸工业建筑工业和手工编制业的重要原料，各地在安排农、副业生产的时候，应该把它当成一种经济作物来处理；对苇塘和农田、竹山和树林做出全面的发展规划。目前，竹子、芦苇收购手续太繁，环节太多，使得收购价格偏低。应该尽量减少收购环节，调整收购价格，以利农民生产。
    在利用废料方面，目前也做得不够，如鞋底、破布、废纸、棉秆、麦秸、甘蔗渣和稻草，都是可以利用的造纸原料。特别是鞋底、破布，根据山东、太原两个国营造纸厂的使用经验证明，破布浆的纤维比木浆还好，成本又比木浆低。可惜现在收购和利用都还做得不够。还有四川、湖北等省的龙须草，纤维比竹子、芦苇还长，也可以用来造纸。造纸工业部门应该加强研究工作，开辟新的原料来源。
    为了补助机制纸的不足，土制纸的生产还应当发展。我国的土制纸生产历史悠久，如安徽的宣纸、浙江的皮纸、福建的连史纸和毛边纸，江西、湖南的各种纸，以及各地大量生产的卫生纸，都是很受人们欢迎的。几年来，土制纸的产量，每年都有二十多万吨，占全国纸的总产量30％左右，在许多方面代替机制纸满足了社会的需要。但是，手工造纸生产合作社、组一般都是资金不足，技术落后，产量不能提高，加以收购价格也多少有些问题，造纸工人的收入很少，熟练的造纸工人的收入还赶不上农业合作社一般社员的收入。因而手工造纸工人纷纷转业，土制纸的产量从去年起有了下降的趋势。中央手工业管理局、全国供销合作总社应该同各地农业生产部门共同研究，赶快解决手工业造纸生产合作社、组的资金、工资和收购价格等问题；造纸工业管理局更应该替手工纸的生产作出长远的规划和年度计划，并且从技术上给予指导和帮助，如果我们确实做到从各方面节约用纸，并积极采取具体措施增产纸张（包括手工造纸），那末纸张供应紧张的状况就会逐步改变。
