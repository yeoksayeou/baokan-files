    The democratic parties and people's organizations of China firmly support the Egyptian people's struggle to safeguard national independence and resist aggression, and jointly decided to establish the "Chinese People's Committee to Support Egypt Against Aggression" on November 8.
    The heroic Egyptian people's strong fight has dealt a heavy blow to the British, French, and Israeli aggressors. The angry protests of peace-loving and justice-upholding countries and people all over the world, especially the Asian and African countries and people, and the just propositions of the Soviet government to resolutely safeguard peace in the Middle East, have finally forced the British, French, and Israeli aggressors to agree to a ceasefire. This powerfully proves that the peace-loving force supporting Egypt's just struggle is incomparably strong.
    However, the invading armies of Britain, France, and Israel are still occupying Egyptian territory and continuing military operations. Imperialists are also trying to realize their political conspiracies in Egypt. To achieve a genuine ceasefire and restore peace, peace-loving countries and people all over the world need to continue their efforts and resolutely support Egypt's struggle against aggression.
    Now people all over China are demanding to support Egypt with manpower and materials. People from all walks of life in China, including military personnel, medical personnel, engineering and technical personnel, and transportation personnel, have expressed their willingness to fight alongside the Egyptian people against aggression. The Chinese People's Committee to Support Egypt Against Aggression will mobilize and organize these forces to realize their wish to support Egypt with practical actions.
    The Chinese people have always worked hard to defend peace and resist aggression. Supporting Egypt's just struggle to safeguard national independence and resist aggression is the sacred task of the Chinese people. We will use all our strength to support Egypt until the invading armies of Britain, France, and Israel withdraw from Egyptian territory and Egypt's struggle against aggression and to safeguard sovereignty is victorious.

    中国人民支援埃及反抗侵略委员会宣言
    号召全世界爱好和平的国家和人民继续努力恢复埃及的和平
    将动员和组织我国人民志愿援埃的力量支持埃及反侵略斗争
    中国各民主党派、各人民团体坚决支援埃及人民维护民族独立、反抗侵略的斗争，共同决定于11月8日成立“中国人民支援埃及反抗侵略委员会”。
    英勇的埃及人民的坚强战斗，使英、法、以色列侵略者遭到了沉重的打击。全世界爱好和平和主持正义的国家和人民，首先是亚非国家和人民的愤怒抗议和苏联政府坚决维护中东和平的正义主张，使英、法、以色列侵略者终于不得不同意停火。这有力地证明，支援埃及正义斗争的爱好和平的力量是无比强大的。
    但是英、法、以色列的侵略军队，现在仍然侵占着埃及的领土，继续着军事行动。帝国主义者还妄图在埃及实现他们的政治阴谋。要实现真正的停火和恢复和平，还需要全世界爱好和平的国家和人民继续努力，坚决支援埃及反抗侵略的斗争。
    现在全中国各地人民都要求以人力和物力来支援埃及。中国各界人民包括军事人员、医务工作人员、工程技术人员和交通运输人员都纷纷表示愿意同埃及人民一起进行反抗侵略的斗争。中国人民支援埃及反抗侵略委员会将动员和组织这些力量，以实现他们用实际行动支援埃及的愿望。
    中国人民一贯为保卫和平、反抗侵略而努力。支援埃及维护民族独立、反抗侵略的正义斗争，是中国人民的神圣任务。我们将用一切力量支援埃及，直到英、法和以色列侵略军队退出埃及领土，埃及反抗侵略、维护主权的斗争取得胜利为止。
