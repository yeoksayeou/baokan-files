    Guangdong Organizes Folk Veterinarians
    (Reported by this newspaper) More than 15,000 folk veterinarians in Guangdong Province will all be organized this year.
    Nearly 10,000 folk veterinarians throughout the province have now joined the Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Workers' Association or joint clinics. Some activists have become the technical backbone of agricultural cooperatives. Traditional Chinese veterinarians in various places are actively participating in livestock disease prevention and control work. Since July, traditional Chinese veterinarians in Huiyang County have cured more than 500 sick cattle. Hu He, a seventy-eight-year-old cattle doctor from Xinhui County, has made public his seventy-two ancestral prescriptions for treating cattle. This year, he has cured more than 300 sick cattle using local prescriptions and local medicines, and is welcomed by the farmers.
    Agricultural departments in various parts of Guangdong have convened meetings of traditional Chinese veterinarians and epidemic prevention workers, rationally resolved their economic treatment issues, helped traditional Chinese veterinarians to sort out their diagnostic and treatment experiences and identify drugs, and promoted their effective prescriptions. At the same time, thirteen counties have held veterinary training courses to impart scientific knowledge of livestock breeding to them.

    广东组织民间兽医
    本报讯　广东省一万五千多名民间兽医将全部在今年组织起来。
    现在全省已有近一万名民间兽医参加畜牧兽医工作者协会或联合诊所。其中有一部分积极分子已成为农业社的技术骨干。各地的中兽医都积极地参加畜疫防治工作。从7月以来，惠阳县的中兽医已治愈病牛五百多头。新会县七十八岁的牛医胡和，公开了他的祖传医牛药方七十二种。他在今年内用土方土药医好了三百多头病牛，受到农民的欢迎。
    广东各地的农业部门召开了中兽医和防疫员会议，合理解决了他们的经济待遇问题，帮助中兽医整理诊疗经验和鉴定药物，推广他们的行之有效的处方。同时，有十三个县举办了兽医训练班，向他们传授各种家畜保育的科学知识。
