Xinhua News Agency, Yumen, November 26th. The Yumen Mining Bureau Refinery overfulfilled its annual total output value plan more than a month ahead of schedule. According to the planning department of this refinery, it is estimated that by the end of the year, the total production value completed by the plant will be 2.9 times that of 1952.

After continuous construction, renovation, and expansion, the refinery's refining equipment has greatly improved its production capacity. It is estimated that the crude oil processing volume this year will increase by more than one and a half times compared to 1952 by the end of the year. The technical level of all employees in the factory has also rapidly improved. In 1949, this factory only produced seven kinds of petroleum products. This year, it has produced twenty kinds of products, and the quality of the products has significantly improved compared to the past. Thanks to the continuous improvement of operating methods and the increase in refining rates by all employees, more than 5,400 tons of gasoline and kerosene were produced in the first ten months of this year.

    玉门炼油厂十个月增产五千多吨油
    新华社玉门26日电　玉门矿务局炼油厂提前一个多月超额完成了今年的总产值计划。据这个炼油厂的计划部门统计，预计到年底全厂完成的生产总值将为1952年的二点九倍。
    炼油厂的炼油设备经过了不断的新建、改建和扩建以后，生产能力大大提高了。今年的原油处理量预计到年底将比1952年增加一倍半以上。全厂职工的技术水平也迅速提高了。1949年这个厂生产的石油产品只有七种，今年生产的产品已经有二十种，产品的质量比过去有显著提高。由于全厂职工不断改进操作方法，提高炼油率，在今年头十个月内增产了汽油和煤油五千四百多吨。
