    The Red Spring
    Yan Zhen
    Below the golden hillside,
    There is a clear mountain spring,
    Spring water gushes from the rocks,
    Flowing through the green grassland.
    On the slope of the rocks,
    Horizontally engraved are a few large characters:
    "The Red Spring,"
    Reflected in the pool below the rocks.
    Why is it called the Red Spring?
    Travelers from afar, please don't ask too much,
    The answer can be found in the shepherdess's song,
    Or please listen to the horse-head fiddle resounding across the grassland.
    Legend says that more than ten years ago,
    There was no spring here,
    Only in people's dreams,
    Could its silver radiance be seen.
    That tall rock,
    Had not a single crack,
    The eagles circling the grassland,
    Often stood on its rocky peak.
    On a winter's night,
    A heavy snowstorm enveloped the world,
    A brave guerrilla fighter,
    Died in battle below that rock.
    At dawn the next day,
    An old man passed by the rock,
    He saw from the blood-stained rock,
    A clear wave bursting forth.
    The spring water sprayed silver flowers,
    Flowing through the frozen grassland,
    The yellowed grass turned green again,
    The lake was once again filled with geese.
    The old man looked at the spring water,
    And drew his silver dagger,
    To carve the name of the spring,
    He climbed the tall rock.
    The spring water flows day and night,
    Through difficult times,
    It is like a blood vessel,
    Rushing with great love.

    红色的泉
    严阵
    金色的山坡下面，
    有一道清清的山泉，
    泉水从岩石中涌出，
    流过绿绿的草原。
    在岩石的斜坡上，
    横刻着几个大字：
    “红色的泉”，
    倒影在岩下的水潭。
    为什么叫它红色的泉啊？
    远路的旅人请不必多问，
    牧羊女的歌声里可以找到回答，
    要不就请听响遍草原的马头琴。
    传说在十几年以前，
    这里并没有泉水，
    只有在人们的梦中，
    才看到它的银辉。
    那块高大的岩石，
    也没有一丝裂缝，
    草原上巡飞的老鹰，
    常站在它的岩顶。
    在一个冬天的夜里，
    大风雪把天地弥漫，
    一个勇敢的游击队员，
    战死在那块岩石下面。
    第二天黎明时分，
    一个老人从岩下经过，
    只见从那血染的岩石上，
    爆裂出一道清波。
    泉水喷着银花，
    流过冰封的草原，
    黄了的草又绿了，
    湖上又落满大雁。
    老人望着泉水，
    拔出银色的短剑，
    为刻下泉水的名字，
    他攀上高高的石岩。
    泉水日夜流着，
    穿过艰苦的年代，
    它就像一条血管，
    奔流着伟大的爱。
