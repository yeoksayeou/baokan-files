    Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 16th - Since mid-August of this year, China has completed aerial photography work on approximately two thousand kilometers of new railway lines. The entire 920-kilometer section from Xi'an to Wuwei has been photographed; most of the photographs for the Xi'an to Hankou and Xining to Qaidam Basin lines have also been taken.

    Aerial photography is an important step in aerial surveying of new lines. Now, the aerial survey work on these new railways based in Xi'an has basically come to an end. Chinese and Soviet engineering and technical personnel of the Aerial Surveying Brigade will move to new bases to conduct the remaining three thousand kilometers of aerial survey work. The large number of aerial photographs taken on the above three new lines are being assembled into complete line topographic maps by indoor personnel; in the field along these three lines, there is also a group of personnel specializing in aerial photograph control surveying, drawing specific terrain and geological conditions on the maps, in order to prepare for the fixed surveying and design of these line projects in the future.

    This aerial surveying work for the new railway was carried out in August this year according to an agreement reached between the Chinese and Soviet railway departments, which is a first in the history of railway construction in our country. Using this method to survey railways not only reduces the arduous labor of surveyors climbing mountains and wading through rivers in the field, but more importantly, it shortens the surveying time.

### 两千公里新铁路线航空摄影完成

    两千公里新铁路线航空摄影完成
    新华社西安16日电　从今年8月中旬到现在，我国已经完成了大约两千公里新铁路线的航空摄影工作。其中西安到武威长约九百二十公里的线路全部摄影完毕；西安到汉口和西宁到柴达木盆地的线路照片，大部分也摄制好了。
    航空摄影是航空测量新线路中的一项重要工作。现在，以西安为基地的这些新铁路上的航测工作，已经基本上告一段落。航空测量总队的中苏两国工程技术人员，将要迁移到新的基地进行其余三千公里的航测工作。在上述三条新线上摄制下来的大批航空照片，正由做内业工作的人员，镶拼成完整的线路地形图；在这三条线路的野外，还有一批专门从事航空像片控制测量工作的人员，往图上描绘地面上具体的地形和地质情况，以便将来为定测和设计这些线路工程做好准备。
    这次航空测量新铁路的工作，是今年8月根据中苏两国铁路部门达成的协议进行的，这在我国建设铁路史上还是第一次。用这种方法勘测铁路，不但可以减少勘测人员在野外爬山涉水的艰苦劳动；更重要的是缩短了勘测的时间。
