    Supplying Gas to Residents

    The gas used by residents of Fushun City has been directly supplied by the Tiger Platform Mine under the Fushun Mining Bureau since 1954. In order to concentrate on coal mining, the Mining Bureau transferred the gas supply business to the Fushun Municipal People's Committee Gas Company. During the handover, Comrade Wang Xinshan, the director of the Mining Bureau, stated: "The supply can be expanded in the future." However, after the handover, the Mining Bureau not only did not expand the supply, but the supply gradually decreased and the quality also declined, causing difficulties for users to cook meals in the morning and evening.

    As far as we know, the gas production of the Longfeng Mine has not decreased compared to before. This is because the Mining Bureau installed gas equipment for more than 400 households in the Tiger Platform Mine in the second quarter of this year. I believe that the Fushun Mining Bureau's practice of only caring about itself and not caring about others is wrong. I hope the Ministry of Coal Industry and the Fushun Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China will intervene in this matter.

    给居民供应煤气
    抚顺市居民用的煤气，从1954年起开始由抚顺矿务局所属老虎台矿直接供给。矿务局为了集中搞好采煤工作，把供应煤气的业务移交给抚顺市人民委员会煤气公司办理。在移交时，矿务局长王新山同志曾表示：“将来还可以扩大供应。”但是，移交以后，矿务局不但不扩大供应，而且供应量逐渐减少，质量也下降，使用户早晚做饭都发生了困难。
    据我们所知，龙凤矿的煤气并没有比前减少。因为矿务局今年第二季又在老虎台矿新安装四百多户的煤气设备。我认为抚顺矿务局这种只顾自己不顾别人的做法是错误的。希望煤炭工业部、中共抚顺市委出来干预这件事。　鼎诚
