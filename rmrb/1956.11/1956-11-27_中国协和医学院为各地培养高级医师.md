Xinhua News Agency:

    China Xiehe Medical College is running various training courses to train senior physicians in various disciplines for all parts of the country.

    The electrocardiogram training course, lectured by Professor Huang Wan, a well-known electrocardiogram expert in China, has recently concluded. Electrocardiography is still a new science in China. Doctors can diagnose the patient's heart condition through the heart beat curve diagram recorded by the electrocardiograph. Participants in this training course included associate professors, lecturers, teaching assistants, and resident physicians with more than three years of experience from teaching hospitals and central hospitals across the country.

    The exercise physiology training course, lectured by Soviet expert Professor Bozhenko, concluded slightly later than the electrocardiogram training course. Currently, the mycology training course and the bacterial physiology training course are in progress. The cytology training course for researching the early diagnosis of uterine cancer, the bone marrow smear examination training course for diagnosing blood diseases, as well as the cystoscopy and urinary tract examination training course, and the virology training course will all begin successively. In addition to attending lectures and clinical observations, the students participating in these training courses will also conduct relevant professional experiments in the laboratory.

    中国协和医学院为各地培养高级医师
    新华社讯　中国协和医学院开办各种训练班，为全国各地培养各科高级医师。
    由我国著名的心电图专家黄宛教授主讲的心电图训练班已在最近结业。心电图在我国还是一门新的科学。医生们可以通过心电描写器纪录下来的心脏搏动曲线图，诊断患者心脏的病情。参加这个训练班的有全国各教学医院和中心医院的副教授、讲师、助教和工作三年以上的住院医师。
    较心电图训练班稍迟结业的是由苏联专家柏琴柯教授主讲的运动生理学训练班。目前正在上课的是真菌学训练班和细菌生理训练班。研究子宫癌瘤早期诊断的细胞学训练班，诊断血液疾病的骨髓象检查训练班，以及膀胱镜和泌尿系检查训练班，病毒学训练班都将相继开学。参加这些训练班学习的学员们除了听课和临床观察外，还要在试验室进行有关专业实验。
