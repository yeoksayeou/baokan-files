    Commemoration and Remembrance
    Written in Commemoration of Sun Yat-sen's Ninetieth Anniversary of Birth
    Xu Deheng
    November 12th of this year marks the ninetieth anniversary of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's birth. The entire country is enthusiastically commemorating this great pioneer of the Chinese revolution, commemorating his lifelong dedication to the cause of the Chinese revolution, commemorating his unyielding spirit in striving for China's independence, democracy, and freedom, commemorating his lifelong pursuit of progress and truth, commemorating his correct understanding and foresight in "taking Russia as a teacher," and commemorating the wisdom of the Three Great Policies of alliance with Russia, cooperation with the Communist Party, and assistance to peasants and workers, which he advocated in his later years.

    Mr. Sun Yat-sen was a selfless patriot. His deeds of constantly fighting against imperialism, feudalism, and traitorous warlords throughout his life are well known. During Mr. Sun's lifetime, my contact with him was limited, and I knew little about his deeds. Now, I will only recall my personal experience during the "May Fourth" Movement.

    After the incident on May 4, 1919, when Beijing students demonstrated against imperialism and traitorous warlords, resulting in the arrest of thirty-one students and one citizen, Mr. Sun Yat-sen supported this movement. He sent a telegram to Duan Qirui, the head of the Beiyang warlords at the time, urging him to release the arrested students as soon as possible. Thanks to the support of Mr. Sun Yat-sen and other people in society, as well as the united efforts of the people, the arrested students were quickly released. In May and June of that year, student representatives from various regions gathered in Shanghai to organize the National Student Federation and expand the student movement. Mr. Sun Yat-sen also supported the students. He invited us to his Shanghai residence for talks on several occasions. I personally participated in such talks twice. Each time, he was very kind and loving, helping and encouraging us. On June 16, 1919, the National Student Federation was established. Shortly after that, we invited Mr. Sun Yat-sen to give a speech at the student association. The speech was given at the "World Student Association" in Shanghai. On that day, Mr. Sun Yat-sen analyzed the Paris Peace Conference and spoke about the Russian Revolution, encouraging us students. During this period, Peking University published publications such as "New Youth," and the Shanghai side, under the leadership of Mr. Sun Yat-sen, also published the "Construction" monthly magazine. Beijing published the combative "Weekly Review," and Shanghai also published the similar "Weekly Commentary." This shows that Mr. Sun Yat-sen's thinking at that time stood on the side of the youth and on the side of progress. The "May Fourth" Movement was an anti-imperialist and anti-warlord patriotic movement, and this movement was influenced by the Russian Revolution at that time. Mr. Sun Yat-sen, who "took Russia as a teacher," wanted to "follow the principles of heaven, respond to human sentiments, conform to the trend of the world, and be based on the needs of the people." After the founding of the Chinese Communist Party, he quickly cooperated with the CCP to carry out the Chinese revolution, which was certainly not accidental.

    "Peace, struggle, save China" - these were Mr. Sun Yat-sen's dying words. Today, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the people of the whole country have victoriously overthrown the evil rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and are victoriously carrying out the socialist industrialization and socialist transformation of the country. However, Taiwan is still occupied by American imperialists, and the people of Taiwan are still under the cruel oppression and exploitation of imperialists, warlords, and bureaucrats. At this time, as we commemorate the ninetieth anniversary of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's birth, we must better learn from Mr. Sun Yat-sen's love for the motherland, love for the people, and firm opposition to imperialism, strengthen unity, work hard, and struggle to the end for the liberation of Taiwan and the completion of the great cause of the Chinese revolution.

    纪念与回忆
    为纪念孙中山先生九十岁生辰而作
    许德珩
    今年11月12日，是孙中山先生九十岁的生辰；全国各地正在热烈地纪念这位伟大的中国革命先行者。纪念他毕生献身于中国革命事业；纪念他为求中国的独立、民主、自由而百折不回的奋斗精神；纪念他一生不断的追求进步、追求真理的精神；纪念他“以俄为师”的正确认识和远见；纪念他晚年所主张的联俄、联共、扶助农工三大政策的英明。
    孙中山先生是一位忘我的爱国主义者，在他的一生中，不断地与帝国主义、封建主义和卖国军阀作斗争的事迹，是大家所知道的。在先生生前，我与他的接触不多，知道的事迹很少，现在仅就“五四”运动这一片段的接触，来作我个人的回忆。
    当1919年5月4日北京学生因反帝、反卖国军阀的示威运动；我们三十一个学生和一个市民被逮捕的事件发生以后，孙中山先生是支持这个运动的；他曾经打过电报给当时的北洋军阀头子段祺瑞，要他从速释放被捕学生；由于孙中山先生和社会上其他人士的支持以及人民群众自己的团结努力，被捕学生才能够很快的出狱。当这年的五、六月间，各地学生代表聚集在上海组织全国学生联合会，扩大学生运动的时候，孙中山先生也是支持学生的，他曾经多次邀集我们到他的上海住宅谈过话，我个人曾经两次参加过这样的谈话。他每次都是很亲切的，慈爱的帮助我们，鼓舞我们。1919年6月16日全国学生联合会成立，就在这以后不久的一天，我们还约请了孙中山先生到学生会来讲演，讲演的地址是借的上海“环球学生会”。孙中山先生那天为我们分析了当时的巴黎和会、讲到了俄国革命，鼓舞了我们学生。就是在这一时期，北京大学出版了新青年等刊物，上海方面由先生领导也出版了“建设”月刊；北京方面出版了战斗性的“每周评论”，上海方面也出版了同样性的“星期评论”。这就可以说明孙中山先生当时的思想是站在青年方面的，是站在进步方面的。“五四”运动是反帝反军阀的爱国运动，而这个运动是受了当时俄国革命的影响的。“以俄为师”的孙中山先生，要“顺乎天理应乎人情，合乎世界之潮流，本乎人群之需要”，当中国共产党成立以后，就很快的与中共合作起来进行中国革命，当然也不是偶然的。
    “和平、奋斗、救中国”这是孙中山先生临终的遗言；今天，全国人民在中国共产党领导之下，胜利地推翻了帝国主义，封建主义和官僚资本主义的罪恶统治，胜利地进行着国家社会主义工业化和社会主义改造事业；可是台湾还在美帝国主义者侵占之中，台湾人民还处在帝国主义和军阀官僚残酷压迫剥削之下，在这个时候，我们来纪念孙中山先生的九十岁生辰，就要更好的学习孙中山先生热爱祖国，热爱人民，坚决的反对帝国的精神，加强团结，努力工作，为解放台湾，完成中国革命的伟大事业而奋斗到底。
