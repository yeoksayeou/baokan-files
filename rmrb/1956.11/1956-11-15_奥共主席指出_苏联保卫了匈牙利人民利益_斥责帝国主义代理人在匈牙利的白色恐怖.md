Xinhua News Agency, November 14th (via TASS, Vienna, November 13th) - The "Austrian People's Voice" newspaper published excerpts from a speech by the Chairman of the Austrian Communist Party, Koplenig, at a meeting of the Upper Austrian party organization.

Koplenig emphasized that in the course of the Hungarian events, the question was decided of "whether the people's democratic system or fascist reaction" would prevail. He said that the reactionaries carrying out the white terror insisted that the events in Hungary were actions to defend "freedom and independence." However, isn't it a mockery of freedom that people like Mindszenty, Otto von Habsburg, Franco, or the bloodthirsty dog Horthy's son came forward to defend freedom? The "Hungarian Committee" established in Vienna even has the Chairman of the Austrian Industrialists Association, the General Secretary of the People's Party, and a leader of the "League of Independents" (a fascist organization) participating. Then what kind of freedom is this? What kind of liberation struggle is supported by these people? The freedom they are referring to is the freedom to turn Hungary into a pillar of capitalism and a fortress against socialism.

Koplenig also said: We communists advocate national independence and advocate that every nation take its own path to socialism. But we do not support bourgeois nationalism. We advocate the great unity of the international proletariat.

The Soviet Union's intervention in this situation was based on the requirements of proletarian solidarity. This intervention not only conformed to the interests of the Hungarian people, but also conformed to the interests of the Austrian people and the people of all countries in the world. The Soviet army entered Hungary as the protector of socialism and peace.

Koplenig said that there is a certain connection between the Hungarian events and the events in the Suez Canal region. The imperialists thought that the Soviet Union would be weakened by the Hungarian events, and therefore they would be able to carry out their colonialist robbery as they pleased. However, the Soviet Union's swift action and its clear statement to Eden, Mollet, and Ben-Gurion served as a warning to the imperialists, telling them that they had miscalculated.

### 奥共主席指出  苏联保卫了匈牙利人民利益  斥责帝国主义代理人在匈牙利的白色恐怖

    奥共主席指出
    苏联保卫了匈牙利人民利益
    斥责帝国主义代理人在匈牙利的白色恐怖
    新华社14日讯　据塔斯社维也纳13日讯：“奥地利人民之声报”摘要刊载了奥地利共产党主席柯普勒尼希在上奥地利党组织会议上发表的演说。
    柯普勒尼希强调指出，在匈牙利事件的发展过程中，决定了“到底是人民民主制度还是法西斯反动派”取得胜利的问题。他说，进行白色恐怖的反动派硬说，匈牙利的事件是保卫“自由和独立”的行动。然而，出面维护自由的竟是明曾蒂、奥托·哈布斯堡、佛朗哥或者嗜血成性的恶狗霍尔蒂的儿子这样一些人，这岂不是对自由的嘲笑吗？在维也纳成立的“匈牙利委员会”竟有奥地利工业家协会主席、人民党总书记和“独立者联盟”（法西斯组织）的一个领导人参加，那么这种自由算是什么样的自由呢？这种人所支持的算是什么样的解放斗争呢？他们所指的自由是把匈牙利变为资本主义的支柱，变为反对社会主义的堡垒的自由。
    柯普勒尼希还说：我们共产党人主张民族独立，主张每个民族通过自己的道路走向社会主义。但是我们并不拥护资产阶级的民族主义。我们主张国际无产阶级大团结。
    苏联在这种局势下所进行的干涉是出于无产阶级团结的要求，这种干涉不仅符合匈牙利人民的利益，而且符合奥地利人民的利益和世界各国人民的利益。苏联军队作为社会主义和和平的保护者开进了匈牙利。
    柯普勒尼希说，匈牙利事件和苏伊士运河地区事件之间存在着某种互相联系。帝国主义者以为，苏联将会因为匈牙利的事件而削弱，因而他们将能为所欲为地进行殖民主义强盗的进军。但是，苏联的迅速行动，它对艾登、摩勒和本—古里安的明确的声明是给帝国主义者的一个警告，告诉帝国主义者：他们失算了。
