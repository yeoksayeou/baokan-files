    More than sixty elderly people in Beijing held a symposium at the Central Research Institute of Culture and History on October 31 to commemorate Mr. Sun Yat-sen. The symposium was presided over by Ye Gongchuo, deputy director of the Central Research Institute of Culture and History. The elderly people present were all contemporaries of Mr. Sun Yat-sen. Some were old comrades-in-arms who had followed Mr. Sun Yat-sen for many years, and some were old scholars who had met Mr. Sun Yat-sen many times. Many elderly people spoke enthusiastically at the meeting, expressing their desire to write memoirs and paint to commemorate Mr. Sun Yat-sen. The picture shows Ye Gongchuo, deputy director of the Central Research Institute of Culture and History, speaking at the meeting.
