    On the Dual Nature of the Contradiction Between the National Bourgeoisie and the Working Class in China
    Li Xuekun, Ma Zhongyang, Ding Weizhi
    We believe that so-called antagonistic contradictions in social life are contradictions between classes, groups, and forces based on mutually hostile interests. Such antagonistic contradictions, by their very nature, are inevitably resolved through external conflict under normal conditions.
    The contradiction between the bourgeoisie and the working class, under normal and general conditions, is this kind of antagonistic contradiction. The relationship between the bourgeoisie and the working class is one of exploitation and being exploited, and their fundamental interests are irreconcilable. Precisely because the capitalist mode of production itself inherently possesses this antagonistic nature, the contradiction between the bourgeoisie and the working class, like the contradiction between slave owners and slaves, feudal lords and peasants, has a general law of development that leads to the extreme intensification of the struggle between the two sides, leading to external conflict, leading to violent revolution. In other words, if we temporarily set aside all special conditions, then, because the contradiction between the bourgeoisie and the working class is antagonistic, its very nature dictates that the method of resolving the contradiction must take the form of external conflict.
    But does this exclude the possibility of the contradiction between the bourgeoisie and the working class transforming from antagonistic to non-antagonistic? Does it mean that the contradiction between the bourgeoisie and the working class is only antagonistic under any conditions? The answer to these questions can only be negative. Because the contradiction between the bourgeoisie and the working class arises and exists within specific conditions, specific environments, and specific historical periods. These special conditions cannot but affect the nature of the contradiction between the bourgeoisie and the working class and the form of resolving this contradiction. Some comrades only acknowledge that special conditions will affect the form of resolving this contradiction, but deny the impact of special conditions on the nature of the contradiction, which is incorrect. Specific, special conditions will place the two sides of the contradiction in specific positions, and they will interact with each other in specific forms of mutual dependence and struggle, thereby giving the contradiction a special nature. Therefore, the specific nature of the contradiction varies depending on the conditions. To correctly understand the nature of the contradiction between the bourgeoisie and the working class, we should specifically examine the historical conditions in which the bourgeoisie and the working class are situated, and examine the special and concrete nature of the contradiction between the bourgeoisie and the working class caused by the influence of these historical conditions.
    The contradiction between the Chinese national bourgeoisie and the working class is, on the one hand, the relationship between exploiters and the exploited, the relationship between two classes with mutually hostile class interests. Therefore, this contradiction has commonalities with the contradiction between the bourgeoisie and the working class in other countries, other eras, and other conditions; it contains antagonism. However, on the other hand, due to the specific conditions in which China is situated, the contradiction between the Chinese national bourgeoisie and the working class, in addition to having an antagonistic nature, also has a non-antagonistic nature. This is different from the contradiction between the bourgeoisie and the working class in general capitalist countries and is a manifestation of China's social specificity. Both antagonistic and non-antagonistic—this is the true nature of the contradiction between the Chinese national bourgeoisie and the working class. To acknowledge only one aspect and deny the other is a one-sided view.
    It should also be explained that the dual nature of the contradiction between the Chinese national bourgeoisie and the working class is not a matter of fifty-fifty or a complete balance. They are not in a state of absolute equilibrium, but are in different positions depending on the degree of development of the contradiction itself and the specific historical conditions. Sometimes the antagonistic nature becomes primary, and sometimes the non-antagonistic nature becomes primary. When the antagonistic nature becomes primary, the basic nature of this contradiction is antagonistic, but the non-antagonistic nature still exists at this time and has not disappeared completely. When the non-antagonistic nature becomes primary, the basic nature of the contradiction is non-antagonistic, but the antagonistic nature still exists at this time and has not disappeared completely. The change in the position of these two natures, antagonism and non-antagonism, the change in their proportion, is the process of the transformation of the basic nature of the contradiction between the Chinese national bourgeoisie and the working class.
    Now, let's talk about the specific basis for this view.
    The nature of the contradiction between the Chinese national bourgeoisie and the working class is determined by the special historical conditions of Chinese society itself. In the period of the democratic revolution before the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Chinese national bourgeoisie and the working class, located in a semi-colonial and semi-feudal society, in addition to the relationship of exploitation and being exploited, also had a united front relationship of jointly opposing imperialism and feudalism. This made the overall nature of the contradiction between them very complex. It is not comprehensive enough to summarize this complex nature with just one concept of "antagonistic," and it cannot reflect the full picture of the nature of the contradiction. During the democratic revolution, the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal revolutionary struggle was the primary task of the national bourgeoisie and the working class. Therefore, the principled differences they had regarding the attitude and strategy of the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal revolutionary struggle became the main content of the contradiction between them. It should be seen that all contradictions between the national bourgeoisie and the working class are rooted in the opposition of the class status of the bourgeoisie and the working class, and are a reflection of the relationship between the exploiting class and the exploited class. Therefore, this contradiction inevitably has an antagonistic nature. But at the same time, it should also be seen that the contradiction between the national bourgeoisie and the working class, under the specific historical conditions of the democratic revolution, since it is based on the premise of the common interests of anti-imperialism and anti-feudalism, and since it is an internal problem of the people who are united in the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal revolution to defeat the common enemy, the contradiction between them will inevitably take on a non-antagonistic nature. When Comrade Mao Zedong talked about class relations during the democratic revolution, he pointed out: "There are still contradictions between these classes, such as the contradiction between labor and capital, which is a significant one; therefore, these classes have some different demands. To obliterate this contradiction, to obliterate this different demand, is hypocritical and wrong. However, this contradiction, this different demand, will not and should not be allowed to develop beyond the common demand throughout the entire new democratic stage. This contradiction and this different demand can be adjusted." (On Coalition Government) It can be seen that if we do not consider the issue abstractly, we cannot ignore the non-antagonistic nature of the contradiction between the national bourgeoisie and the working class during the democratic revolution. Antagonism and non-antagonism seem to be two opposite natures, but they are unified in the unity of the contradiction between the national bourgeoisie and the working class under certain conditions, just as the two opposite natures of compromise and revolution are unified in the unity of the national bourgeoisie. It is unfounded to exclude the dual nature inherent in things under specific conditions.
    Some comrades acknowledge that in the democratic revolution period, anti-imperialism and anti-feudalism "was in the interests of the entire people of our country at that time." And they admit that during this period, the national bourgeoisie and the working class of our country were in a united front. But they believe: "Even so, the fundamental nature of the contradiction between the bourgeoisie and the working class during this period is still antagonistic. This not only means that the fundamental nature of the contradiction between the bourgeoisie and the working class is still antagonistic, but also refers to a series of oppositions arising on the basis of exploitation. The bourgeoisie does not become economically more polite to the working class because it is on the same united front with the working class, and the working class will never give up the struggle to win its own rights. Politically, although there is unity, there is also antagonism." It is of course correct to say that the existence of the united front does not eliminate antagonism. However, it is incorrect to believe that the nature of the contradiction between the national bourgeoisie and the working class in the united front is only antagonistic. It is obviously incorrect to only see that the national bourgeoisie and the working class are exploiters and the exploited in the same mode of production, and to isolate this point, ignoring the unique complexity and diversity of real life. In fact, in the process of the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal democratic revolution, what the Chinese national bourgeoisie and the working class faced was not the question of whether the capitalist mode of production existed, but whether imperialism and feudalism could be overthrown, and whether China's national economy, including the national bourgeoisie's industry and commerce, could break away from the shackles of imperialism, feudal forces, and bureaucratic bourgeoisie and develop independently. Here, the conflict of interests between the national bourgeoisie and the working class, as exploiters and the exploited, was in fact relegated to a secondary position, and the common struggle against imperialism, feudal forces, and the bureaucratic bourgeoisie became the primary task. When the common interests and common struggle of the national bourgeoisie and the working class have become important factors determining the relationship between them, although the opposition of exploitation and being exploited has not disappeared, it is untenable to say that the nature of the contradiction between the two is still completely antagonistic and to deny the existence of the non-antagonistic nature of the contradiction.
    Looking at the entire historical era of the democratic revolution, the contradiction between the Chinese national bourgeoisie and the working class has both antagonistic and non-antagonistic natures. During the First Revolutionary Civil War, the Anti-Japanese War, and the Third Revolutionary Civil War, because their common interests of anti-imperialism and anti-feudalism were higher than the conflict of interests existing within the capitalist mode of production between them, the non-antagonistic nature became the main aspect, which determined that the basic nature of the contradiction between them in these revolutionary stages was non-antagonistic. Although antagonistic factors existed, they were in a secondary aspect. This also determined that the basic form of struggle adopted by the working class against the national bourgeoisie was non-antagonistic. Therefore, the struggle waged by the working class against the national bourgeoisie was not to exclude it and eliminate it, but to better unite it and unite it to oppose the common enemy. The national bourgeoisie adopted a cooperative or neutral attitude towards the working class in these revolutionary stages and became one of the allies that the Chinese working class strived for and united with.
    Another situation also occurred in the democratic revolutionary period. That is, at the end of the First Revolutionary Civil War, the national bourgeoisie, under the threat and temptation of imperialism, feudal forces, and bureaucratic comprador bourgeoisie, deviated from the revolution. The united front between the Chinese national bourgeoisie and the working class broke down, and therefore, in the early stage of the Second Revolutionary Civil War, the antagonistic nature of the contradiction between them became primary, and the basic nature of the contradiction transformed from non-antagonistic to antagonistic, and the form of the struggle of the contradiction also developed into the form of external antagonism. However, during this stage, the contradiction between the national bourgeoisie and imperialism, feudal forces, and the comprador bourgeoisie did not and could not be resolved. The national bourgeoisie did not gain any benefits from imperialism, feudal forces, and the comprador bourgeoisie. Like the workers and peasants of the whole country, it did not gain economic and political liberation. Therefore, even during this period when the united front had broken down, the contradiction between the national bourgeoisie and the working class was still different from the contradiction between the working class and imperialism, feudal forces, and the comprador bourgeoisie, and still had a non-antagonistic nature. Moreover, this non-antagonism was gradually increasing with the intensification of imperialist oppression of China. When Japanese imperialism launched a large-scale war of aggression against China, the national bourgeoisie and the working class restored the united front and jointly resisted imperialist aggression. The non-antagonistic nature of the contradiction between them became the dominant aspect again, and the basic nature of the contradiction transformed into non-antagonistic.
    It can be seen from this that in the democratic revolutionary period, the contradiction between the Chinese national bourgeoisie and the working class, in addition to having an antagonistic nature, also has a non-antagonistic nature at the same time, which is the particularity of this contradiction. Ignoring this point will inevitably lead to serious mistakes. For example, the theoretical basis held by the third "Left" leaning opportunism from 1931 to 1934 was essentially this view that did not pay attention to the particularity of the contradiction between the national bourgeoisie and the working class. They believed that the contradiction between the national bourgeoisie and the working class was only antagonistic, so they put forward the fallacy that the national bourgeoisie was the "most dangerous enemy" and formulated the wrong policy of overthrowing everything and denying unity. As a result, the Chinese revolution suffered huge losses.
    This is the general situation of the nature of the contradiction between the Chinese national bourgeoisie and the working class and the evolution of the form of struggle in the democratic revolution stage.
    The founding of the People's Republic of China marked the end of the democratic revolution stage and the beginning of the socialist revolution stage. Corresponding to this great historical transformation, the relationship between all classes in Chinese society also underwent a huge change. When the task of socialist revolution has been put on the agenda, eliminating classes, eliminating exploitation, and transforming multiple social and economic components into a single socialist economic component in China have become the main tasks of the Chinese people's revolution. The contradiction between the national bourgeoisie and the working class has become the main contradiction in the country, and the question of who will defeat whom has become the most urgent and important issue in real life.
    However, during this period, the contradiction between the Chinese national bourgeoisie and the working class is still a contradiction with both antagonistic and non-antagonistic natures. As Comrade Liu Shaoqi pointed out in the political report at the Eighth National Congress of the Party: Politically, the national bourgeoisie still has a dual nature. On the one hand, it expresses support for the people's democratic dictatorship, supports the Common Program and the Constitution, is willing to continue to oppose imperialism, and agrees with land reform; on the other hand, it also has a strong desire to develop capitalism and resists the socialist revolution from its narrow class interests. Therefore, the working class, which has seized political power, still maintains the political alliance with the national bourgeoisie established in the democratic revolution stage and still implements the policy of both unity and struggle, seeking unity through struggle. Economically, capitalist industry and commerce also have a dual nature that is beneficial to the national economy and people's livelihood and detrimental to the national economy and people's livelihood. Therefore, the working class, which has seized the economic lifeline of the country, has also established an economic alliance with the national bourgeoisie. In this alliance, it implements the policy of utilizing, restricting, and transforming capitalist industry and commerce, and peacefully transitions capitalist ownership to socialist ownership through the form of state capitalism. The existence of this united front politically and economically shows that the contradiction between the national bourgeoisie and the working class in the socialist revolution stage has a unique and complex nature. The national bourgeoisie is not only the object of the socialist revolution carried out by the working class, but also the object of unity in the process of the working class realizing the socialist revolution. This relationship is different from the relationship between the working class and the bureaucratic bourgeoisie in the democratic revolution stage, and it is also different from the relationship between the working class and the bourgeoisie when the Soviet Union implemented the socialist revolution. In the socialist revolution period, the nature of the contradiction between the Chinese national bourgeoisie and the working class is like this: there is both the relationship of exploitation and being exploited, so the contradiction has an antagonistic nature; there is also the relationship of political and economic alliance, so the contradiction has a non-antagonistic nature. It can be seen that the opinion that denies that the contradiction between the national bourgeoisie and the working class has both antagonistic and non-antagonistic natures does not conform to the actual situation of the relationship between the national bourgeoisie and the working class in the socialist revolution period.
    The socialist revolution is a revolution to eliminate capitalist ownership and eliminate the bourgeoisie. Naturally, this revolution is incompatible with the fundamental interests of the bourgeoisie. Therefore, when the democratic revolution ended and the socialist revolution began, the struggle to restrict and counter-restrict became the main form of class struggle in the country. The antagonistic nature of the contradiction between the Chinese national bourgeoisie and the working class gradually rose to become the main aspect, and the struggle of the contradiction also took the form of external antagonism. The "Five-Anti" movement launched in 1952 was a manifestation of the sharpening of the antagonistic nature of the contradiction between the national bourgeoisie and the working class. The "Five-Anti" movement was a profound and sharp class struggle carried out by the working class to consolidate its leading position, repel the bourgeoisie's rampant attack, stop the bourgeoisie's illegal activities, and create favorable conditions for the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce. The "Five-Anti" movement adopted the methods of mass struggle and legal sanctions, that is, it was realized in the form of external antagonism. In this struggle, the conflict of class interests between the national bourgeoisie and the working class became the primary issue. However, since this struggle was carried out after the working class seized political power, this situation made the specific form of this contradiction struggle different from the situation in the early stage of the Second Revolutionary Civil War. Under the power of the working class and under the call of the Party's policies, the vast majority of lawbreakers in the bourgeoisie bowed their heads and confessed their crimes and returned to the position of loving the country and abiding by the law. Therefore, although the basic nature of the contradiction between the national bourgeoisie and the working class was antagonistic during this period, the united front did not break down because of this.
    Due to the "Five-Anti" movement and the education of the Party's various policies, the national bourgeoisie gradually realized that the socialist revolution was the general trend, so they expressed their willingness to accept socialist transformation. The non-antagonistic nature of the contradiction gradually rose to become the dominant aspect, so the Communist Party and the People's Government adopted the policy of redemption towards the national bourgeoisie and transformed capitalist private ownership into socialist public ownership through peaceful transition. After the primary form of state capitalism and other preparations, the joint state-private operation of all industries in capitalist industry and commerce was realized at the end of 1955 and the beginning of 1956. Correspondingly, the state adopted a fixed interest rate system on the issue of profit distribution. This is a decisive step in changing capitalist private ownership into socialist public ownership. This major change has had a huge impact on the nature of the contradiction between the Chinese national bourgeoisie and the working class and the way to resolve it (that is, the form of struggle).
    After the joint state-private operation of all industries, the capitalist ownership itself and the capitalist production relations themselves underwent a fundamental change in nature. The national bourgeoisie has in fact given up the right to control the means of production of enterprises, given up the ruling power of enterprise management, and given up the right to distribute enterprise profits. At present, the exploitation of the national bourgeoisie is only manifested in fixed dividends and high wages. The fundamental change in the nature of capitalist ownership marks that the task of transforming capitalist ownership into socialist ownership has been basically completed, and the question of who will defeat whom between capitalism and socialism has been resolved. This change within the capitalist economy has fundamentally resolved the contradiction between the national bourgeoisie and the working class. Of course, this joint state-private operation of state capitalism is not yet socialism, and there is still some degree of exploitation here. Therefore, there is still a contradiction between the national bourgeoisie and the working class. The basic nature of this contradiction is non-antagonistic, and it will not completely disappear until the bourgeoisie completely abandons exploitation.
    It can be seen from this that the contradiction between the Chinese national bourgeoisie and the working class is generally both antagonistic and non-antagonistic. The basic nature of the contradiction can change because the positions occupied by these two natures are different, transforming from non-antagonistic to antagonistic, and from antagonistic to non-antagonistic. However, the dual nature should never be seen as a single nature. Without the antagonistic nature, it would not be the contradiction between the bourgeoisie and the working class; without the non-antagonistic nature, it would not be the contradiction between the Chinese national bourgeoisie and the working class.
    These are some of our views on the nature of the contradiction between the Chinese national bourgeoisie and the working class, the form of struggle of the contradiction, and the relationship between these two aspects.
    Currently, there are different opinions on this issue.
    One opinion is that the contradiction between the Chinese national bourgeoisie and the working class is antagonistic, and the antagonistic nature of this contradiction will never change until the day the national bourgeoisie is eliminated. As for the form of struggle of the contradiction between the national bourgeoisie and the working class, it can be non-antagonistic due to various conditions. We cannot agree with this opinion. First, this opinion essentially abandons the particularity of the contradiction between the Chinese national bourgeoisie and the working class. Of course, as they pointed out, to reveal the universality of things, we cannot but abandon some of the particularity of things, because universality is the result of abstraction. However, they ignore that the nature of a specific thing includes not only the universality of this thing, that is, the universal essence, but also the particularity of this thing, that is, the special essence. It is of course possible to "abstract" the nature that the contradiction between the Chinese national bourgeoisie and the working class has in common with the contradiction between the bourgeoisie and the working class in other countries, but this is no longer the issue we are discussing. What we are discussing is the nature of the contradiction between the Chinese national bourgeoisie and the working class, so we must never abandon the particularity of this specific contradiction. Then, what is the particularity of the contradiction between the Chinese national bourgeoisie and the working class? This opinion does not tell us. Second, why do China's specific historical conditions and social conditions only affect the form of struggle of the contradiction between the Chinese national bourgeoisie and the working class, and will not touch the nature of this contradiction? Why do the correct policies of the Communist Party and the People's Government, the dual nature of the national bourgeoisie itself, the existence of other classes (such as the landlord class and the comprador bourgeoisie), favorable international conditions, etc., only affect the form of struggle of the contradiction, and will not affect the nature of the contradiction? To regard the nature of a thing, a contradiction, as something that is insulated from the outside world and unaffected by the outside world, it is impossible to understand the particularity of things due to different conditions, and it is impossible to correctly understand the special essence of contradictions. In fact, the contradiction between the Chinese national bourgeoisie and the working class is different from the contradiction between the foreign bourgeoisie and the working class, which is recognized by everyone; similarly, this contradiction is also different from the contradiction between the comprador bourgeoisie and the working class, which is also recognized by everyone. These two differences are both differences in nature. To only believe that the contradiction between the national bourgeoisie and the working class is antagonistic, it is impossible to fully show the particularity of this contradiction. Third, this opinion also regards the nature of the contradiction between the national bourgeoisie and the working class as immutable, which is also inconsistent with the actual situation. This point has been said before, and I will not repeat it here.
    Another opinion is that the antagonistic nature of the contradiction and the antagonistic form of the struggle of the contradiction are completely the same thing. The so-called antagonistic contradiction is the contradiction in the antagonistic form. And from this, it is extended to say that the contradiction between the Chinese national bourgeoisie and the working class has always (or except for the period of the Second Revolutionary Civil War) been non-antagonistic. We cannot agree with this opinion. First, it is inappropriate to equate the nature of the contradiction with the form of the struggle of the contradiction. Because the so-called form of the struggle of the contradiction is the method adopted to resolve the contradiction. Obviously, although the method of resolving the contradiction is determined by the nature of the contradiction, it is not equal to the nature of the contradiction. Second, this opinion understands the antagonistic form of the contradiction very narrowly. It seems that in China, socialism has not been realized through violent revolution, so there is no antagonistic contradiction between the national bourgeoisie and the working class. In fact, in the early days of our country, the speculative and blind nature of the capitalist economy, the various behaviors of many capitalists who unscrupulously pursued exorbitant profits to the extent of violating national laws, and the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" struggles caused by this, were all manifestations of this antagonistic contradiction. Ignoring this fact is obviously incorrect. Third, although this view sees the particularity of the contradiction between the Chinese national bourgeoisie and the working class, that is, the non-antagonistic aspect of the contradiction, it ignores the generality of the contradiction, that is, the antagonistic aspect of the contradiction. Because no matter how great the characteristics of the Chinese national bourgeoisie are, it is still the owner of the means of production and relies on exploiting wage labor for a living. The fundamental reason why capitalists are the natural enemies of the working class lies in this capitalist exploitation system, and in the fact that capitalists are the representatives of this exploitation system. Therefore, the Chinese national bourgeoisie will inevitably have a universal character of the bourgeoisie, and the contradiction between it and the working class will inevitably have an antagonistic aspect.
    Therefore, we believe that it is incorrect to regard the relationship between the Chinese national bourgeoisie and the working class as a purely antagonistic contradiction or a purely non-antagonistic contradiction.
    Understanding the dual nature of the contradiction between the Chinese national bourgeoisie and the working class and the form of struggle will help us correctly understand and implement the Party's policy of both unity and struggle towards the national bourgeoisie and overcome or prevent "Left" or Right deviations.

    论我国民族资产阶级和工人阶级矛盾的两重性
    李学昆　马仲扬　丁伟志
    我们认为所谓社会生活中的对抗性的矛盾，就是阶级、集团、力量之间以相互敌对的利益为基础的矛盾。这种对抗性的矛盾按其本性来说，在通常的条件下，它是必然要通过外部冲突的形式才能获得解决。
    资产阶级和工人阶级的矛盾，在通常的、一般的条件下就是这种对抗性的矛盾，资产阶级和工人阶级间的关系是剥削和被剥削的关系，它们之间的根本利益是不能相容的。正因为资本主义生产方式本身固有这种对抗的性质，所以资产阶级和工人阶级的矛盾就如同奴隶主和奴隶的矛盾，封建主和农民的矛盾一样，它的一般的发展规律，是要导致矛盾双方斗争的高度激化，是要导致外部冲突，导致暴力革命。换句话说，假如暂时抛开一切特殊条件不谈，那末，资产阶级和工人阶级的矛盾，由于它是对抗性的，所以其本身性质就规定着解决矛盾的方法必然要采取外部冲突的形式。
    但这是否就排斥了资产阶级和工人阶级的矛盾从对抗转化为非对抗的可能呢？是否就意味着资产阶级和工人阶级的矛盾在任何条件下都只是对抗性的呢？对这些问题的答复只能是否定的。因为资产阶级和工人阶级的矛盾是在具体的条件，具体的环境，具体的历史时期内发生和存在的。这种特殊条件不可能不影响到资产阶级和工人阶级矛盾的性质及解决这个矛盾的形式。有些同志只承认特殊的条件会影响到解决这个矛盾的形式，而否认特殊的条件对矛盾的性质的影响，是不正确的。具体的、特殊的条件会使矛盾的双方处在特定的地位，并采用特定的形式和对方发生相互依存又相互斗争的关系，从而使矛盾具有特殊的性质。所以条件不同，矛盾的具体性质也就不同。要想正确地了解资产阶级和工人阶级矛盾的性质，就应当具体地考察资产阶级和工人阶级所处的历史条件，考察由于这些历史条件的影响所造成的资产阶级和工人阶级的矛盾的特殊的、具体的性质。
    中国民族资产阶级和工人阶级的矛盾，一方面是剥削者和被剥削者的关系，是阶级利益相互敌对的两个阶级的关系，因此，这个矛盾和其他国家、其他时代、其他条件下的资产阶级和工人阶级的矛盾有共同性，它包含着对抗性。但是，另一方面，由于中国所处的具体条件，中国民族资产阶级和工人阶级的矛盾除了有对抗的性质之外，还具有非对抗的性质，这是不同于一般资本主义国家中资产阶级和工人阶级的矛盾之处，是中国社会特殊性的表现。既有对抗性又有非对抗性，这是中国民族资产阶级和工人阶级矛盾的真实性质，只承认其中一方面，否认另一方面，是片面的看法。
    还应当说明，中国民族资产阶级和工人阶级矛盾的二重性质，并不是半斤八两、平分秋色的。它们不是处于绝对平衡的状态，而是随着矛盾本身的发展程度不同，随着具体历史条件的不同，处于不同的位置上。有时对抗性成为了主要的，有时非对抗性成为了主要的。当着对抗性成为了主要的时候，这一矛盾的基本性质就是对抗的，但是这时非对抗的性质仍然是存在着，并没有消失净尽；当着非对抗性成为了主要的时候，矛盾的基本性质就是非对抗的，但是，这时对抗的性质也仍然是存在的，也并没有消失净尽。对抗和非对抗这二重性质的位置的变化，比重的变化，也就是中国民族资产阶级和工人阶级矛盾基本性质的转化的过程。
    下面就谈谈这种看法的具体根据。
    中国民族资产阶级和工人阶级之间矛盾的性质，是由中国社会本身的特殊的历史条件所决定的。在中华人民共和国成立以前的民主革命时期中，处于半殖民地半封建社会中的中国民族资产阶级和工人阶级，除了存在着剥削与被剥削的关系之外，还存在着共同反对帝国主义、反对封建主义的统一战线的关系，这就使得他们之间矛盾的总体具有了非常复杂的性质。对这种复杂的性质，单是用一个“对抗性”的概念加以概括，是不够全面的，不能反映矛盾性质的全貌的。在民主革命时期中，反帝、反封建的革命斗争是民族资产阶级和工人阶级首要的任务，因而他们对于反帝、反封建革命斗争的态度、策略等问题上所具有的原则性的分歧，就成了他们之间矛盾的主要内容。应该看到，民族资产阶级和工人阶级之间的一切矛盾，都是根源于资产阶级与工人阶级阶级地位的对立，是剥削阶级与被剥削阶级之间的关系的体现，因而这种矛盾必然带有对抗的性质。但是同时也要看到，处于民主革命的特定的历史条件下的民族资产阶级和工人阶级的矛盾，既然是建立在反帝、反封建的共同利益的大前提下，既然是反帝、反封建革命过程中为击败共同的敌人而联合起来的人民内部的问题，因而他们之间的矛盾也必然会带上非对抗的性质。毛泽东同志在谈到民主革命时期中的阶级关系时，曾指出：“这些阶级之间仍然是有矛盾的，例如劳资之间的矛盾，就是显著的一种；因此，这些阶级各有一些不同的要求。抹杀这种矛盾，抹杀这种不同要求，是虚伪的和错误的。但是，这种矛盾，这种不同的要求，在整个新民主主义的阶段上，不会也不应该使之发展到超过共同要求之上。这种矛盾和这种不同的要求，可以获得调节。”（论联合政府）可见，假如不是抽象地考虑问题，就不能忽视在民主革命时期中民族资产阶级和工人阶级之间矛盾的非对抗性质。对抗性和非对抗性看来是两种相反的性质，但是它们在特定的条件下却统一于民族资产阶级和工人阶级的矛盾的一体之中，就如同妥协性和革命性这两种相反的性质统一于民族资产阶级的一体之中一样。排斥在特定条件下事物所固有的两重性，是没有根据的。
    有些同志承认在民主革命时期，反帝反封建“是我国当时全民利益之所在”。并且承认在这时期中，我国民族资产阶级和工人阶级是处于统一战线中。但是他们认为：“虽然如此，在这个时期中资产阶级和工人阶级的矛盾的根本性质仍然是对抗的。这不仅意味着资产阶级和工人阶级的矛盾的根本性质仍然是对抗的，而且还指在剥削的基础上产生一系列的对立。资产阶级并不因它和工人阶级同处在统一战线之内而在经济上对工人阶级客气些，工人阶级也决不放弃争取自己权利的斗争。在政治上，虽然存在着统一，也并不是不存在对抗。”说统一战线的存在并不能使对抗消灭掉，当然是对的。但是，认为在统一战线中的民族资产阶级和工人阶级的矛盾的性质，仅仅只是对抗的，这就不对了。只看到民族资产阶级和工人阶级是同一生产方式中的剥削者和被剥削者，并且把这一点孤立起来，不顾及现实生活中特有的复杂性、多样性，显然是不对的。事实上，在反帝反封建的民主革命过程中，摆在中国民族资产阶级和工人阶级面前的，并不是资本主义生产方式存在与否的问题，而是帝国主义和封建主义能否被推翻，包括民族资产阶级的工商业在内的中国国民经济能否摆脱帝国主义、封建势力、官僚资产阶级的束缚而独立发展的问题。这里，民族资产阶级和工人阶级，作为剥削者与被剥削者之间的利益的冲突，事实上被推到了次要的地位上去，而反对帝国主义、封建势力和官僚资产阶级的共同斗争，成了首要的任务。当民族资产阶级和工人阶级的共同利益，共同斗争，已经成为决定他们之间关系的重要因素时，虽然剥削和被剥削的对立并未消失，但因此说两者的矛盾的性质仍然完全是对抗的，否认矛盾的非对抗性的存在，是说不过去的。
    就民主革命整个历史时代来看，中国民族资产阶级和工人阶级的矛盾是具有对抗和非对抗两重性质的。在第一次国内革命战争时期，抗日战争时期，和第三次国内革命战争时期，由于他们反帝、反封建的共同利益已经高出于他们相互间在资本主义生产方式内部存在的利益的冲突，所以，非对抗性就成了主要的方面，这就决定了他们在这几个革命阶段上矛盾的基本性质是非对抗的。对抗性因素虽然存在，但它居于次要的方面。这也就决定了，工人阶级对民族资产阶级所采取的基本的斗争形式是非对抗的，所以工人阶级对民族资产阶级进行的斗争，并不是为了排斥它，消灭它；而是为了更好地团结它，团结它一起反对共同的敌人。民族资产阶级在这几个革命阶段中，与工人阶级采取了合作的或中立的态度，成为了中国工人阶级争取和团结的同盟者之一。
    在民主主义革命时期中也出现过另外一种情况。那就是当第一次国内革命战争末期，民族资产阶级在帝国主义、封建势力、官僚买办资产阶级的威胁诱惑之下，背离了革命。中国民族资产阶级和工人阶级的统一战线破裂了，因而在第二次国内革命战争初期，他们之间的矛盾的对抗性质，就成为了主要的，矛盾的基本性质由非对抗转化成了对抗，矛盾的斗争形式也便发展成为了外部对抗的形式。不过，在这一阶段中，民族资产阶级和帝国主义、封建势力、买办资产阶级的矛盾并没有也不可能获得解决。民族资产阶级并没有从帝国主义、封建势力和买办资产阶级那里获得丝毫好处，它和全国工农一样，并没有得到经济上和政治上的解放。因此，即使是在这个统一战线已经破裂的时期内，民族资产阶级和工人阶级的矛盾，仍然不同于工人阶级和帝国主义、封建势力、买办资产阶级的矛盾，仍然具有非对抗的性质。而且这种非对抗性随着帝国主义对中国压迫的加剧，逐渐地在上升着，当日本帝国主义发动了对中国的大规模侵略战争的时候，民族资产阶级和工人阶级又恢复了统一战线，共同抵抗帝国主义的侵略，他们之间的矛盾的非对抗性又成了主导的方面，矛盾的基本性质又转化成为了非对抗的了。
    由此可见，在民主革命时期中，中国民族资产阶级和工人阶级的矛盾，除了具有对抗的性质之外，还同时具有非对抗的性质，这也就是这一矛盾的特殊性。忽略了这一点，就不免要犯严重的错误。例如1931年到1934年的第三次“左”倾机会主义所持的理论根据，实质上就是这种不注意民族资产阶级和工人阶级矛盾的特殊性的观点。他们认为民族资产阶级和工人阶级的矛盾仅仅是对抗的，所以他们提出了民族资产阶级是“最危险的敌人”的谬论，制定了一切打倒，否认联合的错误政策。结果使中国革命遭到巨大损失。
    这就是民主革命阶段中中国民族资产阶级和工人阶级的矛盾性质及其斗争形式的演化的一般状况。
      中华人民共和国的成立，标志着民主革命阶段的结束，社会主义革命阶段的开始。与这一历史上的大转变相适应，中国社会各阶级的关系也发生了一次巨大的变动。当社会主义革命的任务已提到日程上来，在中国消灭阶级，消灭剥削，把多种社会经济成分转变为单一的社会主义经济成分，已成为中国人民革命的主要课题时，民族资产阶级和工人阶级的矛盾就成了国内主要矛盾，谁战胜谁的问题就成了现实生活里最迫切、最重要的问题。
    但是，在这时期里，中国民族资产阶级和工人阶级的矛盾仍然是一个带有对抗和非对抗两重性质的矛盾。正如刘少奇同志在党的第八次全国代表大会上的政治报告中所指出的：在政治上民族资产阶级仍然具有两重性，一方面表示拥护人民民主专政，拥护共同纲领和宪法，愿意继续反对帝国主义，赞成土地改革；另一方面又有发展资本主义的强烈愿望，从其狭隘的阶级利益出发对于社会主义革命有所抵抗。因此，掌握了政权的工人阶级仍然继续保持了在民主革命阶段所成立的和民族资产阶级在政治上的联盟关系，仍旧实行又团结，又斗争，以斗争求团结的政策。在经济上，资本主义工商业也具有有利于国计民生和不利于国计民生的两重性。因此，掌握了国家经济命脉的工人阶级又和民族资产阶级建立了经济上的联盟，在这个联盟中实行对资本主义工商业利用、限制、改造的政策，通过国家资本主义的形式把资本主义所有制和平过渡为社会主义所有制。在政治上、经济上这种统一战线的存在，就说明了在社会主义革命阶段，民族资产阶级和工人阶级的矛盾有着独特的复杂的性质。民族资产阶级不仅是工人阶级进行社会主义革命的对象，而且又是工人阶级实现社会主义革命过程中团结的对象。这种关系不同于在民主主义革命阶段中工人阶级和官僚资产阶级的关系，也不同于苏联实行社会主义革命时工人阶级和资产阶级的关系。在社会主义革命时期，中国民族资产阶级和工人阶级的矛盾的性质就是这样的：既有剥削与被剥削的关系，因而矛盾就带有对抗性；又有政治上、经济上联盟的关系，因而矛盾就带有非对抗性。可见，否认民族资产阶级和工人阶级的矛盾具有对抗和非对抗两重性质的意见，也不符合于社会主义革命时期民族资产阶级和工人阶级的关系的实际状况。
    社会主义革命，是消灭资本主义所有制，消灭资产阶级的革命，自然这个革命是和资产阶级的根本利益不能相容。因此，当着民主革命结束，社会主义革命开始以后，限制和反限制的斗争就成为了国内阶级斗争的主要形式。中国民族资产阶级和工人阶级矛盾的对抗性质，就逐渐上升为主要的方面，矛盾斗争也随之采取了外部对抗的形式。1952年间开展的“五反”运动，就是民族资产阶级和工人阶级的矛盾的对抗性质尖锐化的表现。“五反”运动，是工人阶级为了巩固自己的领导地位，打退资产阶级的猖狂进攻，制止资产阶级的违法活动，以为对资本主义工商业实行社会主义改造创造有利的条件而进行的一场深刻、尖锐的阶级斗争，“五反”运动采取了群众斗争和法律制裁的方法，也就是说是以外部对抗的形式实现的。在这场斗争中，民族资产阶级和工人阶级的阶级利益的冲突成了首要的问题。不过，这场斗争既是在工人阶级掌握了政权之后进行的，这种情况就使得这一次矛盾斗争的具体形式不同于第二次国内革命战争初期的状况。在工人阶级的威力下，在党的政策的感召下，资产阶级中的违法分子绝大多数低头认罪，重新回到了爱国守法的立场上。所以，虽然在这个时期中，民族资产阶级和工人阶级矛盾的基本性质是对抗的，但是统一战线并未因此而破裂。
    由于“五反”运动及党的各项政策的教育，民族资产阶级逐渐地认清了社会主义革命是大势所趋，于是他们表示愿意接受社会主义改造。矛盾的非对抗性又逐渐地上升为主导的方面，因此共产党和人民政府对民族资产阶级才采取了赎买的政策，通过和平过渡的方法把资本主义私有制改造成社会主义全民所有制。经过初级形式的国家资本主义，以及其他各方面的准备，在1955年底与1956年初，实现了资本主义工商业全行业的公私合营。与此相适应，在利润分配问题上，国家采取了定息的制度。这是变资本主义私有制为社会主义公有制的一个决定性的步骤，这一重大的变化，对我国民族资产阶级和工人阶级间矛盾的性质及其解决方式（即斗争形式），发生了巨大影响。
    全行业公私合营以后，资本主义所有制本身、资本主义生产关系本身发生了根本性质的变化。民族资产阶级事实上已经放弃了企业的生产资料支配权，放弃了企业管理的统治权和企业利润的分配权。现时民族资产阶级的剥削，就只表现在定额的股息和高工薪方面了。资本主义所有制这一根本性质的变化，标志着资本主义所有制转变为社会主义所有制的任务业已基本完成，资本主义和社会主义之间谁战胜谁的问题业已获得解决。这一资本主义经济内部的变化，就使得民族资产阶级和工人阶级的矛盾在基本上获得了解决。当然，这种公私合营的国家资本主义还不就是社会主义，这里还存在着某种程度的剥削，因此，民族资产阶级和工人阶级之间也还存在着矛盾，这种矛盾的基本性质是非对抗性的，它要等到资产阶级完全放弃了剥削之后，才能完全消失。
    从这里可以看出，中国民族资产阶级和工人阶级之间的矛盾一般地说来是带有对抗和非对抗二重性的，矛盾的基本性质可因为这二重性所占的地位各不相同而发生变化，从非对抗转化为对抗，从对抗转化为非对抗。但是，绝不应该把二重性看成为单一性。没有对抗的性质，就不成其为资产阶级和工人阶级的矛盾；没有非对抗的性质，就不成其为中国的民族资产阶级和工人阶级的矛盾。
    这就是我们对中国民族资产阶级和工人阶级之间矛盾的性质，矛盾斗争的形式，以及这两方面的相互联系的一些看法。
    目前，在这个问题上还存在着不同的意见。
    一种意见认为：中国民族资产阶级和工人阶级的矛盾是对抗性的，而且这种矛盾的对抗性质直到民族资产阶级消灭的一天为止，始终不会发生变化。至于民族资产阶级和工人阶级矛盾斗争的形式，则因种种条件所使，因此可以是非对抗的。这种意见我们不能同意。第一，这种意见实质上是抛开了中国民族资产阶级和工人阶级矛盾的特殊性。固然如他们所指出的，要揭露事物的普遍性，就不能不抛开事物的某些特殊性，因为普遍性是抽象化的结果。但是他们忽略了具体事物的性质除了包括这事物的普遍性即普遍本质外，也包括这事物的特殊性即特殊本质。把中国民族资产阶级和工人阶级的矛盾与其他国家资产阶级和工人阶级的矛盾共同具有的性质“抽象”出来，当然是可以的，但这已不是我们所讨论的问题所在了。我们所讨论的是中国的民族资产阶级和工人阶级矛盾的性质，因此就绝不能抛开这一具体矛盾的特殊性不谈。那么，中国民族资产阶级和工人阶级矛盾的特殊性何在呢？这种意见并没有告诉我们。第二，为什么中国的具体历史条件，社会条件，仅仅影响到中国民族资产阶级和工人阶级矛盾斗争的形式，而不会触动这个矛盾的性质呢？为什么共产党和人民政府的正确政策，民族资产阶级本身的两重性，其他阶级的存在（譬如，地主阶级，买办资产阶级），有利的国际条件等等，只会影响到矛盾斗争的形式，而不会影响矛盾的性质呢？把一个事物，一种矛盾所具有的性质，看成是和外界绝缘，不受外界影响的东西，就不能理解事物因条件不同而具有的特殊性，不能正确地认识矛盾的特殊本质。其实，中国民族资产阶级和工人阶级的矛盾与外国资产阶级和工人阶级的矛盾是有所不同的，这是大家所承认的；同样，这个矛盾与买办资产阶级和工人阶级的矛盾也不相同，这也是大家所承认的。这两种不同，都是性质上的不同。只认为民族资产阶级和工人阶级之间的矛盾是对抗的，就不能充分地表明这个矛盾的特殊性。第三，这种意见还把民族资产阶级和工人阶级的矛盾的性质，看成是一成不变的，这也是不符合实际情况的。这一点前面已经说过了，这里就不再重复。
    另一种意见认为：矛盾的对抗性质和矛盾斗争的对抗形式完全是一回事，所谓对抗的矛盾，就是处于对抗形式中的矛盾。并且由此引申说，中国民族资产阶级和工人阶级的矛盾，从来（或者第二次国内革命战争时期除外）都是非对抗性的。这种意见我们也不能同意。第一，把矛盾的性质和矛盾斗争的形式完全等同起来，是不恰当的。因为所谓矛盾斗争的形式，乃是解决矛盾所采用的方法，显然，解决矛盾的方法虽然是由矛盾的性质所决定，但它并不等于矛盾的性质。第二，这种意见把矛盾对抗的形式，了解得非常狭隘，似乎在中国没有经过暴力革命来实现社会主义，所以民族资产阶级和工人阶级之间就没有对抗性的矛盾。事实上，在我们建国初期，资本主义经济的投机性和盲目性，很多资本家不择手段地追求暴利以至不惜违犯国家法律的种种行为，以及由此而引起的“三反”、“五反”斗争，都是这种对抗性矛盾的表现，忽视了这一事实，显然是不正确的。第三，这种看法虽然看到了中国民族资产阶级和工人阶级矛盾的特殊性，即矛盾的非对抗性方面，但却忽略了矛盾的一般性，即矛盾的对抗性方面。因为不管中国民族资产阶级具有多么大的特点，但它终究是生产资料的所有者，是依靠剥削雇佣劳动为生的。资本家所以是工人阶级的天生的冤家对头，其根本原因就在于这种资本主义的剥削制度，就在于资本家是这个剥削制度的代表者。所以中国民族资产阶级就必然会具有一种资产阶级的普遍性格，它和工人阶级的矛盾就必然有对抗性的方面。
    因此，我们认为把中国民族资产阶级和工人阶级之间的关系看成是单纯的对抗性矛盾，或者是单纯的非对抗性矛盾，都是不正确的。
    对于中国民族资产阶级和工人阶级的矛盾及其斗争的形式的两重性的理解，将有助于我们正确地认识和执行党对于民族资产阶级又团结、又斗争的政策，克服或防止“左”的或右的偏差。
