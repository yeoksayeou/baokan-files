Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 18th - Premier Pham Van Dong of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam held a grand reception tonight at the Presidential Palace of Vietnam to welcome Premier Zhou Enlai of China, who is visiting the Democratic Republic of Vietnam for the first time.

President Ho Chi Minh attended the reception.

At 7:30 PM, Premier Zhou Enlai arrived at the reception venue amidst warm applause.

Premier Pham Van Dong spoke first at the reception. On behalf of the government and people of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, he extended warm greetings to Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier He Long, and their entourage, and paid tribute to the great Chinese people who are victoriously advancing on the road to building a prosperous and strong socialist country.

Pham Van Dong said that both Vietnam and China are members of the socialist and people's democratic camp, and both have a common goal – to continuously improve the people's living standards, safeguard world peace, and build a socialist society.

He said that when both our countries were suffering under imperialist oppression, the relations between our two peoples were very close in the struggle for national liberation. The restoration of peace in Vietnam has created more favorable conditions for the development of friendship between Vietnam and China. On the basis of complete equality, respect for territorial integrity, national sovereignty, national independence, and non-interference in each other's internal affairs, the relations between the two countries in various fields such as economy and culture have greatly developed. We have strengthened the relations between our two countries and contributed to maintaining peace in Asia, Africa, and the world. The Vietnamese and Chinese people are loyal to the Bandung spirit, unite with all Asian and African countries opposing colonialism, and warmly support the Egyptian people in opposing the aggression of British and French imperialism and defending the integrity of their territorial sovereignty.

He further said that in the process of healing the wounds of war and rebuilding the motherland, the Vietnamese people have received generous and selfless assistance from the Chinese government and people in terms of equipment, technology, etc., and Chinese experts have demonstrated a lofty spirit of internationalism, selflessly helping the Vietnamese people.

Speaking here, Pham Van Dong, on behalf of the government and people of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, expressed sincere gratitude to the government and people of the People's Republic of China.

Pham Van Dong then said that Vietnam still faces many difficulties in its struggle for peace and unification: the Geneva Accords are being seriously threatened, and the South Vietnamese regime is unwilling to fulfill the relevant political clauses aimed at unifying Vietnamese territory. Moreover, American imperialism is stepping up the import of weapons and military personnel into South Vietnam, attempting to turn South Vietnam into another country, thereby dividing Vietnam for a long time and placing South Vietnam under the control of American imperialism. But the imperialists cannot stop the progress of history. Thanks to our own efforts, and with the sympathy and support of China, the Soviet Union, and the world's great forces for peace, the Vietnamese people are closely and widely united in the Fatherland Front, under the leadership of the Vietnamese Labor Party, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and President Ho Chi Minh, and will surely achieve victory in the political struggle for peace and unification on the basis of the Geneva Accords.

Pham Van Dong concluded by saying that the friendship between Vietnam and China, built on the foundation of common interests and common ideals, is growing stronger and developing. He firmly believes that Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to Vietnam will play a huge role in further strengthening the fraternal relations between the two countries and will contribute to safeguarding peace in Asia and the world.

After the hosts and guests toasted, Premier Zhou Enlai then spoke. He said that the Vietnamese people, under the leadership of the Vietnamese Labor Party and President Ho Chi Minh, have waged a long, arduous, and unyielding struggle against colonial rule and for national independence and freedom. It is precisely this heroic struggle of the Vietnamese people that liberated the northern part of Vietnam and enabled the Vietnamese people to win international recognition for their national rights at the 1954 Geneva Conference.

Zhou Enlai said that the United States is deliberately dividing Vietnam and carrying out various obstructions to the peaceful unification of Vietnam, attempting to turn southern Vietnam into its colony and war base, preventing the free general elections in all of Vietnam from being held as scheduled. This behavior, which disregards international credibility and violates the Geneva Accords, imposes an undeniable obligation on the countries participating in the Geneva Conference to take joint and effective measures to seek the thorough implementation of the Geneva Accords.

He said that although the Vietnamese people's cause of peaceful unification of their motherland has not yet been completed due to the obstruction and sabotage of the United States, the achievements made by the Vietnamese people in the construction of all aspects in northern Vietnam under the leadership of the Vietnamese Labor Party, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and President Ho Chi Minh, are pointing out the path of independent development of the motherland to the Vietnamese people from north to south. The Chinese people will, as in the past, resolutely support the Vietnamese people's construction work and struggle for the peaceful unification of their motherland.

Zhou Enlai continued, saying that Vietnam is China's brotherly country, and the Vietnamese people are the Chinese people's close comrades-in-arms.

He said that our two countries are not only countries that have achieved independence from long-term anti-colonialist struggles, but also members of the large socialist family headed by the Soviet Union. The relationship between our two countries is firmly established on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. He said that the Chinese people regard further strengthening this friendly and united relationship between our two countries as their lofty international obligation.

He concluded by proposing a toast to the close, unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and Vietnamese people, and to the great unity of all peace-loving and justice-upholding countries and people in the Asian-African region and the world.

The speeches of Pham Van Dong and Zhou Enlai were constantly met with applause from the audience. The banquet proceeded in a very warm and friendly atmosphere.

More than 350 people attended tonight's reception. Among them were: Vice Premiers Phan Ke Toai, Vo Nguyen Giap, Chairman Ton Duc Thang and Vice-Chairman Ton Quang Phiet of the Standing Committee of the National Assembly, Politburo member Truong Chinh of the Vietnamese Labor Party, ministers of various government ministries, senior generals such as General Chief of Staff Van Tien Dung of the Vietnamese People's Army, and Chairman Tran Duy Hung and Vice-Chairman Tran Danh Tuyen of the Hanoi Administrative Committee.

Heads of mass organizations such as the Vietnam Fatherland Front, various democratic parties, and the Vietnam-China Friendship Association attended the reception.

Chinese Ambassador to Vietnam Luo Guibo and diplomatic envoys from various countries, consuls-general from India and Indonesia, the acting head of the French government's delegation in Hanoi, and heads of the Indian, Polish, and Canadian delegations of the International Commission were invited to attend the reception.

Vietnamese labor models, Chinese experts, and journalists from various countries stationed in Hanoi also attended the reception.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 19th - Chairman Tran Duy Hung of the Hanoi City Administrative Committee hosted a banquet tonight in honor of Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier He Long, and their entourage, who are visiting Vietnam.

More than 250 people were invited to the banquet, including: Vietnamese Premier Pham Van Dong, Vice Premiers Phan Ke Toai and Vo Nguyen Giap, ministers of various Vietnamese government ministries, heads of various parties, representatives of the National Assembly and the Fatherland Front, people from all walks of life in Hanoi, Chinese experts, overseas Chinese, diplomatic envoys and representatives of various countries stationed in Hanoi, and heads of the Indian, Polish, and Canadian delegations of the International Commission, etc.

After Tran Duy Hung delivered a welcoming speech, Premier Zhou Enlai also spoke. He expressed his respect to the people of Hanoi and the people of Vietnam on behalf of the people of Beijing and the entire Chinese people, and wished the Vietnamese people greater achievements in their struggle for the peace and unification of their motherland, and wished the people of Vietnam and China eternal friendship for generations to come.

After the reception, Zhou Enlai, accompanied by Tran Duy Hung, watched a song and dance performance at the Hanoi Grand Theater.

    范文同总理为周总理访越举行盛宴
    河内市行政委员会主席陈维兴宴请周总理
    新华社河内18日电　越南民主共和国总理范文同今天晚上在越南主席府举行盛大的招待会，欢迎第一次访问越南民主共和国的中国总理周恩来。
    胡志明主席参加了这次招待会。
    七时三十分，周恩来总理在热烈的掌声中到达了招待会会场。
    范文同总理首先在招待会上讲话。他代表越南民主共和国政府和人民向周恩来总理、贺龙副总理和同行者致热烈的敬礼，并且向正在建设一个富强的社会主义的中国的道路上胜利前进的伟大的中国人民致敬。
    范文同说，越南和中国都是社会主义和人民民主阵营中的成员，都有着共同的目标——不断提高人民的生活水平，保卫世界和平和建设社会主义社会。
    他说，当我们两国还蒙受帝国主义压迫的时候，在民族解放斗争中，我们两国人民的关系就很密切。越南和平的恢复，为越中两国友谊的发展创造了更有利的条件。在完全平等、尊重领土完整、国家主权、民族独立和互不干涉内政原则的基础上，两国经济、文化等各方面的关系都有了很大的发展。我们加强了我们两国的关系，为维护亚非和世界和平作出了贡献。越南人民和中国人民忠于万隆精神，联合各反对殖民主义的亚非国家，热烈支持埃及人民反对英法帝国主义的侵略，保卫自己领土主权的完整。
    他又说，在医治战争创伤和重建祖国的过程中，越南人民得到中国政府和人民在设备、技术等方面的慷慨无私的援助，中国专家都发挥了崇高的国际主义精神，忘我地帮助越南人民。
    说到这里，范文同代表越南民主共和国政府和人民，向中华人民共和国政府和人民表示诚恳的谢意。
    范文同接着说，越南在为和平和统一的斗争中还有着许多困难：日内瓦协定正遭到严重威胁、南越政权不愿履行旨在统一越南领土的有关的政治条款。不仅如此，美帝国主义正加紧把武器和军事人员输入南越，企图把南越变成另一个国家，从而长期分割越南，把南越置于美帝国主义控制之下。但是帝国主义者是无法阻挡历史的前进的。由于我们自己的努力，由于得到中国、苏联以及世界上巨大的和平力量的同情和支持，越南人民紧密地、广泛地团结在祖国战线中，在越南劳动党、越南民主共和国政府和胡志明主席的领导下，在日内瓦协定基础上的争取和平、统一的政治斗争中一定能取得胜利。
    范文同最后说，越中两国建立在共同利益和共同理想的基础上的友谊正在日益加强和发展。他坚信，周恩来总理这次访问越南对进一步密切两国的兄弟关系将起着巨大的作用，并且将对保卫亚洲和世界和平作出贡献。
    在宾主碰杯以后，周恩来总理接着讲话。他说，越南人民为了反对殖民统治和争取民族的独立和自由，在越南劳动党和胡志明主席的领导下，曾经进行了长期的、艰苦的、不屈不挠的斗争。正是越南人民的这种英勇斗争使越南的北部得到了解放，并且使越南人民在1954年的日内瓦会议上，为自己的民族权利赢得了国际承认。
    周恩来说，美国蓄意分割越南并且对越南的和平统一进行种种阻挠，企图把越南南部变成它的殖民地和战争基地，使全越南的自由普选不能如期举行。这种不顾国际信义、破坏日内瓦协议的行为，使参加日内瓦会议的国家有不可推卸的义务，采取共同的有效措施，谋求日内瓦协议的彻底实现。
    他说，尽管越南人民和平统一祖国的事业由于美国的阻挠和破坏还没有完成，但是，越南人民在越南劳动党、越南民主共和国政府和胡志明主席的领导下，在越南北部各方面的建设中所取得的成就，正在向从北到南的越南人民指出祖国独立发展的道路。中国人民将会像过去一样坚决地支持越南人民的建设工作和争取祖国和平统一的斗争。
    周恩来接着说，越南是中国的兄弟之邦，越南人民是中国人民的亲密的战友。
    他说，我们两国不仅都是从长期的反殖民主义斗争中取得独立的国家，而且也都是以苏联为首的社会主义国家大家庭的成员。我们两国的关系牢固地建立在和平共处的五项原则之上。他说，中国人民把进一步加强我们两国之间的这种友好团结的关系，看做是自己的一个崇高的国际义务。
    他最后建议为中越两国人民亲密无间、牢不可破的友好关系，为亚非地区和世界上一切爱好和平和主持正义的国家和人民的大团结干杯。
    范文同和周恩来的讲话不断博得全场的鼓掌。宴会在非常热烈友好的气氛中进行。
    出席今晚招待会的有三百五十多人。他们中间有：副总理潘继遂、武元甲，国民大会常务委员会委员长孙德胜、副委员长孙光阀，越南劳动党政治局委员长征，政府各部部长，越南人民军总参谋长文进勇等高级将领和河内行政委员会主席陈维兴、副主席陈名宣等。
    越南祖国战线、各民主党派和越中友好协会等群众团体的负责人都出席了招待会。
    中国驻越南大使罗贵波和各国的外交使节，印度、印度尼西亚的总领事，法国政府驻河内代表团代理团长以及国际委员会的印度、波兰和加拿大代表团负责人都应邀参加了招待会。
    越南的劳动模范、中国专家和各国驻河内记者也参加了招待会。
    新华社河内19日电　河内市行政委员会主席陈维兴今天晚上设宴招待来越南访问的中国总理周恩来、副总理贺龙和随行人员。
    应邀参加宴会的有二百五十多人，他们是：越南总理范文同，副总理潘继遂、武元甲，越南政府各部部长，各党派负责人，国民大会和祖国战线的代表，河内市各界人士，中国专家，华侨，驻河内的各国外交使节和代表，国际委员会的印度、波兰、加拿大代表团负责人等。
    在陈维兴致欢迎词之后，周恩来总理也讲了话。他代表北京市人民和全中国人民向河内市人民和全越南人民表示敬意，并且祝越南人民在为祖国和平、统一的斗争中获得更大的成就，祝越中两国人民世世代代永远友好。
    招待会完毕以后，周恩来在陈维兴陪同下，到河内大戏院观看歌舞表演。
