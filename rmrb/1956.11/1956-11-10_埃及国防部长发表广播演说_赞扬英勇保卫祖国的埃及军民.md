Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, November 9th: Egyptian Defense Minister Major General Abdel Hakim Amer, in a radio address on the evening of November 8th, praised the Egyptian people and the Egyptian armed forces for heroically defending their homeland.

Amer said that the Egyptian people and the Egyptian armed forces had “fought against vile big powers and achieved a tremendous victory.” He said: “Egypt is proud of its army and its people.”

Amer said: “Israel was unable to defeat our army. So Israel’s allies, Britain and France, vilely attacked us from behind.” He said that he ordered the Egyptian army to retreat to the west bank of the Suez Canal to avoid the Egyptian army being bogged down in the desert under British and French air raids.

He said: "But the commanders in Rafah, Abu Aweigila, and Sharm el-Sheikh preferred to fight to the last soldier, inflicting as much damage as possible on the enemy."

Major General Amer praised the Egyptian naval forces, saying: “They have been able to sink heavy enemy naval vessels.”

He concluded his radio address with a warning to the aggressors. He said that the Egyptian people are steadfast and unyielding, “nothing can overwhelm us.”

    新华社9日讯　开罗消息：埃及国防部长阿卜杜勒·哈基姆·阿密尔少将11月8日晚间在一篇广播演说中赞扬英勇地保卫祖国的埃及人民和埃及武装部队。
    阿密尔说，埃及人民和埃及武装部队已经“同卑鄙的大国进行了战斗，而且取得了巨大的胜利”。他说：“埃及为它的军队和人民感到骄傲。”
    阿密尔说：“以色列不能够战胜我们的军队。于是以色列的盟国英国和法国卑鄙地从背后来进攻我们。”他说，他命令埃及军队撤退到苏伊士运河的西岸，以避免埃及军队在英法的空袭下被拖住在沙漠地带。
    他说：“但是拉法、阿布阿韦吉拉和沙姆沙伊赫的司令们宁愿战斗到最后一个战士，而使敌人遭受到尽可能大的损失。”
    阿密尔少将赞扬埃及的海军部队说：“它们已经能够击沉敌人的重型海军舰艇。”
    他在结束他的广播演说时对侵略者提出了警告。他说，埃及人民是刚毅不屈的，“没有任何东西能够压倒我们”。
