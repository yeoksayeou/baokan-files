    Strengthened Specific Leadership, Abolished Unnecessary Prohibitions
    Pig Production in Hubei Increases Rapidly
    Early November Figures Nearly Double Those of March and April
    Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 21st: Since September this year, Hubei Province has been increasing its pig production by an average of 500,000 heads per month. According to statistics from the animal husbandry department, by early November, the province's pig population had reached over 4,550,000, nearly double the number in March and April of this year. In the mountainous areas of western Hubei, such as Enshi, Xingshan, and Changyang counties, the average household raises more than one pig. In Xianfeng County, the average household raises more than three pigs. Even in some counties in the plains area where pig farming was relatively less common, the number of pigs raised has now increased.
    Farmers in Hubei Province have traditionally raised pigs, but due to past neglect of the pig industry and the existence of many unreasonable phenomena in the development of pig production, pig production had been declining. In the spring of this year, the province had only 2,500,000 pigs, a 51% decrease compared to 1953, the year with the highest pig production in the province. To change this situation, Hubei Province has taken a series of measures, especially after the provincial pig production conference in September. Various localities have prominently strengthened their leadership over pig production, and most counties have established animal husbandry sections. Various localities have widely publicized the state's specific policies for developing pig production, abolished the past methods of "assigned purchasing and assigned raising" and restrictions on the circulation of piglets, and simultaneously implemented the policies of "self-raising, self-slaughtering, and self-consumption" and "collective raising, collective slaughtering, and collective consumption" for farmers, as well as free sales. Various localities have also adjusted the price difference between live pigs and pork, appropriately reduced feed prices, improved the quality of bran, and improved feed supply methods. At the same time, the state issued 1 million yuan in loans and supplemented 65 million catties of grain as feed grain prepaid to farmers for advance purchases of pigs. Due to the vigorous adoption of the above measures by various localities, farmers' enthusiasm for raising pigs has greatly increased. According to statistics, in the past six months or so, the number of sows in the province has increased by one and a half times, and 2 million piglets have been bred. This has ensured a rapid increase in pig production. In Yichang Prefecture, there were only over 480,000 pigs in March and April of this year, but now the number has reached over 730,000.
    However, there are still some problems that urgently need to be solved in the development of pig production in Hubei Province. For example, some areas have not paid enough attention to pig production, feed is very scarce in individual areas, and some places are currently experiencing swine fever, etc.

    加强了具体领导，取消了不必要的禁令
    湖北的猪很快地增加起来
    十一月上旬比三、四月间多了将近一倍
    新华社武汉21日电　湖北省从今年9月以来，平均每月增产生猪五十万只。根据畜牧部门的统计，到11月上旬，这个省的生猪已经达到四百五十五万多只，比今年3、4月间增长了将近一倍。鄂西山区恩施、兴山、长阳等县平均每户养猪一只以上，咸丰县平均每户养猪三只多。平原地区部分养猪较少的县，现在养猪的数量也有增加。
    湖北省农民从来就有养猪的习惯，由于过去忽视养猪业以及发展生猪生产中存在着许多不合理的现象，生猪生产不断下降。今年春季，全省只有生猪二百五十万只，比这个省生猪生产最多的年份1953年下降了51％。为了改变这一情况，湖北省采取了一系列的措施，特别是9月间全省生猪生产会议以后，各地突出地加强了对生猪生产工作的领导，大部分县成立了畜牧科。各地广泛地宣传了国家发展生猪生产的各项具体政策，取消了过去的“派购派养”的办法和对小猪流通的限制，同时实施了农民“自养自宰自食”、
  “伙养伙宰伙食”和自由出卖的政策。各地又调整了毛猪和猪肉的差价，适当地降低了饲料价格，提高了麸糠的质量，改进了饲料的供应办法。与这同时，国家发放了一百万元贷款，补发了六千五百万斤粮食作为预购生猪时预付给农民的饲料粮。由于各地大力采取了上述措施，农民养猪的劲头大了。据统计，半年多来，全省母猪数字增加了一倍半，繁殖了子猪二百万只。这就保证了养猪量迅速增加。宜昌专区今年3、4月间只有生猪四十八万多只，现在已经达到七十三万多只。
    但是，湖北省在发展生猪生产中，还存在一些问题急待解决。例如，部分地区对生猪生产没有引起重视，个别地区的饲料非常不足，目前有些地方正在发生猪瘟等等。
