Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 28th - After changing the method of processing for state-owned commercial enterprises, the candy factories under the Tianjin Municipal Food Industry Company have increased more than 50 new varieties by purchasing raw materials and selling products themselves.

　　The candy factories in the Chenxiang District transferred veteran technicians to form technical teams and trial-produced more than 30 new varieties. Large candy factories such as Dahua, Jiating, and New China have resumed production of high-grade candies such as banana cotton candy, Mickey Mouse toffee, and cream coconut toffee. Due to the increase in varieties, the sales channels for products have also opened up. In the third quarter, the candy factories reversed the past phenomenon of losing money during the off-season and overfulfilled their profit plans.

　　In the past, when the candy factories were processing for commercial departments, they all adopted the attitude of "only asking about production and not asking about sales," so there were few varieties, and various places reflected that Tianjin candy was "the same old three." When commercial departments asked the factories to add some new varieties, the factories often emphasized the difficulties in production and were unwilling to accept them, resulting in sluggish product sales and a large backlog during the off-season. After the factories switched to self-production and self-sales in June this year, they became concerned about the sales channels of products and actively tried to increase new varieties.

    天津各糖果厂自产自销品种增加
    新华社天津28日电　天津市食品工业公司所属各糖果厂改变给国营商业加工的办法，由自己购买原料和销售产品以后，增加了五十多种新品种。
    城厢区各糖果厂抽调老技术工人组成技术组，试制出三十多种新品种。大华、嘉亭、新中国等大型糖果厂恢复生产香蕉棉花糖、米老鼠太妃糖、奶油椰子太妃糖等高级糖果。由于品种增加，产品销路也就打开了。各糖果厂在第三季度扭转了过去淡季赔钱的现象，超额完成了利润计划。
    各糖果厂过去给商业部门加工时，都抱着“只问生产不问销售”的态度，所以品种少，各地反映天津糖果是“老三样”。当商业部门要求各厂增加一些新品种时，工厂往往强调生产上的困难而不愿接收，以致产品销售不畅，造成淡季大量积压。今年6月间各厂改为自产自销后，就关心产品的销路，积极设法增加新品种。
