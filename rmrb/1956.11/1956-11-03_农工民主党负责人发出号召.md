Xinhua News Agency, 2nd November. Leading members of the Central Executive Bureau and the Beijing Municipal Committee of the China National Democratic Construction Association, along with representatives from some grass-roots organizations, numbering over fifty, gathered separately at 8:00 PM tonight to express their immense anger at the barbaric act of the British and French military aggression against Egypt, and resolved to support the just struggle of the heroic Egyptian people for a long time to come.

	Zhang Bojun, Chairman of the China National Democratic Construction Association, called on all members of the Association to unite closely around the Chinese government, heighten vigilance, and be ready at any time to deal a heavy blow to the instigators of war. Huang Qixiang, Secretary-General of the Central Executive Bureau Committee of the China National Democratic Construction Association, said: "Historical experience proves that peace-loving people always become stronger with fighting, and war-mongers will inevitably suffer shameful destruction." Wu Zongji, a member of the China National Democratic Construction Association and Associate Research Fellow at the Institute of Linguistics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, stated that in order to defend human science and world peace, we must stand with the Egyptian people, and resolutely fight the aggressors to the end.

    农工民主党主席章伯钧号召农工民主党全体党员紧紧地团结在我国政府的周围，提高警惕，随时准备给战争的发动者以沉重的打击。农工民主党中央执行局委员会秘书长黄琪翔说：“历史的经验证明：爱好和平的人民总是愈战愈强，战争贩子一定要遭到可耻的毁灭。”农工民主党党员、中国科学院语言研究所副研究员吴宗济表示，我们为了保卫人类科学和世界和平，一定和埃及人民一条心，坚决和侵略者斗争到底。
