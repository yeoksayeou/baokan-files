Xinhua News Agency, 31st Budapest News: Imre Nagy, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Hungarian People's Republic, stated in a radio address at 14:30 on the 30th: “The increasingly acute revolution within our country has placed the movement of democratic forces at a crossroads. The All-National Government, with the full agreement of the Presidium of the Hungarian Working People's Party, has decided on measures of decisive importance for national life, and I now announce these measures to the Hungarian people. In order to continue the democratization movement in our country, and to end the single-party system, we are building the government on its original foundation of 1945 – the era of the coalition system of democratic parties. To this end, we have established a cabinet composed of a limited number of people within the government, consisting of the following: Imre Nagy (Hungarian Working People's Party), Zoltán Tildy (Smallholders Party), Béla Kovács (Smallholders Party), Ferenc Erdei (National Independence Party), János Kádár (Hungarian Working People's Party), Géza Losonczy (National Independence Party), and a representative to be appointed by the Social Democratic Party. The government has recommended to the Presidium of the People's Republic to select János Kádár and Géza Losonczy as Ministers of State. The All-National Government urges the Soviet military command to immediately begin withdrawing troops from the Budapest area.”

Nagy added: “The All-National Government also announces that it will immediately begin negotiations with the Soviet government to effect the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Hungary. In the name of the All-National Government, I announce that the government recognizes the local self-governing bodies democratically established during the revolution, relies on them, and agrees with their activities.”

In concluding his speech, Nagy called on all Hungarians to defend the achievements of the revolution, restore order, end the bloodshed, and support the All-National Government's determination to work for a free, democratic, and independent Hungary.

Xinhua News Agency, 31st: According to the Hungarian News Agency, Budapest, 30th, negotiations between Imre Nagy, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Hungarian People's Republic, and representatives of the armed forces, representatives of freedom fighters, members of the revolutionary committee, and representatives of revolutionary intellectuals and university students began at 18:00 on October 30th.
