Premier Zhou Enlai's Speech

Respected Ambassador, Comrades, Friends:

Today is the 39th anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution. We are very pleased to be here to celebrate this great festival. On behalf of the Chinese Government and the Chinese people, I extend my heartfelt and warm congratulations to the Soviet Government and the Soviet people.

Under the leadership of the Soviet Communist Party and the Soviet Government, the great Soviet people are confidently implementing the massive Sixth Five-Year Plan and are constantly achieving successes. The achievements of the Soviet people not only advance the cause of communist construction in their own country but also greatly strengthen the power of the socialist camp.

In the past year, the Soviet Union's consistent policy of peaceful coexistence among nations in international relations has achieved further results. This has played a positive role in enhancing mutual trust among nations and promoting the relaxation of the international situation.

However, for the purpose of colonialism, the British and French governments, in collusion with Israel, launched a war of aggression against Egypt, which seriously threatens world peace. The Soviet Union, together with all peace-loving and justice-upholding countries, firmly demands that the governments of Britain, France, and Israel immediately cease their aggression against Egypt and withdraw their troops from Egyptian territory. The Soviet Union has also suggested that the United Nations Security Council take emergency measures to stop the aggression of Britain, France, and Israel against Egypt. This just stance of the Soviet Union proves that the Soviet Union is the most resolute defender of world peace and the freedom and independence of all countries. The Chinese Government and the Chinese people strongly condemn the aggressive acts of Britain, France, and Israel, and resolutely oppose any form of interference in Egypt. The heroic Egyptian people will not yield, and the broad masses of people around the world stand with the Egyptian people. If the colonialists persist in their aggressive acts against Egypt, they will surely play with fire and burn themselves.

In the past year, the Soviet Union has made great efforts to strengthen its unity with socialist countries. Recently, the Soviet Government issued a declaration on the basis for developing and further strengthening the friendship and cooperation between the Soviet Union and other socialist countries. This step taken by the Soviet Government will further strengthen the unity and friendly relations among socialist countries, thereby promoting the common economic upsurge of socialist countries. The Chinese people fully support the principles put forward in the Soviet Government's declaration.

Recently, domestic and foreign counter-revolutionary elements in Hungary took advantage of the Hungarian people's dissatisfaction with the mistakes made by past Hungarian leaders, and took advantage of the resulting chaos in Hungary, to launch a frenzied attack on the revolutionary forces in Hungary. Faced with bloody lessons, the patriotic Hungarian people quickly saw through the counter-revolutionary plot of restoration, reorganized their forces, formed the Hungarian Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government headed by Comrade Kadar, and, with the assistance of Soviet troops, quickly crushed the Hungarian counter-revolutionaries' criminal plot. We firmly support the struggle of the Hungarian people and the Hungarian Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government to defend the cause of socialism, and the just action of proletarian internationalism taken by the Soviet Union in the Hungarian incident.

The great friendship between our two countries has gained deeper and more comprehensive development in the past year. In April of this year, in addition to the 156 industrial enterprises that the Soviet government had previously agreed to help our country establish, it added assistance to our country in the construction of 55 new industrial enterprises. The experts sent by the Soviet government are helping us in socialist construction with a lofty spirit of internationalism. I would like to take this opportunity, on behalf of the Chinese Government and the Chinese people, to express my heartfelt thanks to the Soviet Government and the Soviet people for this fraternal and sincere assistance. The Chinese people know from their own experience that the great and eternal friendship between China and the Soviet Union is fully in line with the fundamental interests of our two peoples and all progressive mankind. Further consolidating and developing this friendship will greatly enhance the strength of peace, democracy, and socialism, and will make a significant contribution to safeguarding world peace and the cause of human progress. The Chinese people will always cherish this unbreakable friendship. I propose a toast:

To the great achievements of the Soviet people in building communism and safeguarding world peace,

To the health of the leading comrades of the Soviet Communist Party and the Soviet Government,

To the eternal and unbreakable great friendship between our two peoples,

To lasting world peace!

    周恩来总理的讲话
    敬爱的大使同志、同志们、朋友们：
    今天是十月社会主义革命三十九周年纪念日，我们非常高兴地在这里庆祝这个伟大的节日。我代表中国政府和中国人民向苏联政府和苏联人民表示衷心的热烈的祝贺。
    伟大的苏联人民在苏联共产党和苏联政府的领导下，正在满怀信心地执行着巨大的第六个五年计划，并且在不断地取得成就。苏联人民的成就，不仅推进了自己国家的共产主义建设事业，而且大大地增强了社会主义阵营的力量。
    一年来，苏联在国际关系中一贯奉行的各国和平共处的政策，又获得了进一步的成果。这对于增进各国之间的互相信任和促进国际局势的和缓，起了积极的作用。
    但是，英法政府为了殖民主义的目的，伙同以色列，对埃及发动了侵略战争，严重地威胁着世界和平。苏联同所有爱好和平和主持正义的国家一起，坚决要求英法和以色列的政府立即停止对埃及的进攻，并且把他们的军队撤出埃及领土。苏联还曾经建议联合国安全理事会采取紧急措施来制止英法和以色列对埃及的侵略。苏联的这种正义立场证明苏联是世界和平和各国自由独立的最坚决的捍卫者。中国政府和中国人民强烈地谴责英法和以色列的侵略行为，并且坚决反对以任何方式对埃及进行干涉。英勇的埃及人民是不会屈服的，全世界广大的人民都同埃及人民站在一起。如果殖民主义者坚持对埃及的侵略行为，他们必将玩火自焚。
    一年来，苏联在加强自己同社会主义各国的团结方面作了很大的努力。最近苏联政府发表了关于发展和进一步加强苏联同其他社会主义国家的友谊和合作的基础的宣言。苏联政府所采取的这个步骤将会进一步加强社会主义国家间的团结和友好关系，从而促进社会主义各国共同的经济高涨。中国人民完全支持苏联政府宣言中所提出的原则。
    最近匈牙利的国内外反革命分子利用匈牙利人民对于过去匈牙利领导者所犯的错误的不满，利用匈牙利国内由此产生的混乱局面，向匈牙利革命力量进行了疯狂的进攻。匈牙利的爱国人民在血的教训面前，很快地识破了反革命的复辟阴谋，重新整顿了自己的力量，组成了以卡达尔同志为首的匈牙利工农革命政府，并且在苏联驻军的协助下，迅速地粉碎了匈牙利反革命的罪恶阴谋。我们坚决支持匈牙利人民和匈牙利工农革命政府保卫社会主义事业的斗争和苏联在匈牙利事件中所采取的无产阶级国际主义的正义行动。
    我们两国的伟大友谊，一年来获得了更加深入和全面的发展。今年4月，苏联政府除了早先规定的帮助我国建立一五六项工业企业以外，又增加了援助我国建设五十五项新的工业企业。苏联政府派来的专家以崇高的国际主义精神帮助我们进行社会主义建设。我愿借此机会，代表中国政府和中国人民对苏联政府和苏联人民这种兄弟般的真诚援助表示衷心的感谢。中国人民根据自己的亲身经验深知中苏两国的伟大的永恒的友谊是完全符合于我们两国人民和全体进步人类的根本利益的。进一步巩固和发展这个友谊将会极大地增强和平、民主、社会主义的力量，并且为维护世界和平和人类进步事业作出重大贡献。中国人民将永远珍视这个牢不可破的友谊。我提议：
    为苏联人民在建设共产主义和维护世界和平事业中的巨大成就，
    为苏联共产党和苏联政府领导同志们的健康，
    为我们两国人民永恒的、牢不可破的伟大友谊，
    为世界持久和平干杯！
