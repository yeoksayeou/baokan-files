Xinhua News Agency, November 15th - According to TASS: The Egyptian Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Muhammad al-Quni, delivered a speech on Moscow Radio on the evening of the 13th. He said that the Soviet Union has forever won the hearts of the Egyptian people. The historical moment has arrived for consolidating the relations between Egypt and the Soviet Union and strengthening cooperation between the two countries. At this moment, Egypt knows who its true friends are.

Quni said that all nationalities of the Soviet Union sympathize with and support Egypt. The residents of Port Said have won the same glory and reputation in the Soviet Union as the residents of the hero cities of Stalingrad and Leningrad have won in the world.

He said that after the treacherous conspiracy of the aggressors against Egypt was revealed, the Soviet government declared that it believed in the strength of Egypt and believed that Egypt would achieve victory. This position of the Soviet government strengthened our people's confidence in the just cause for which they were fighting and consolidated our people's determination to win victory.

The Egyptian people, the people of all Arab countries, the people of the entire East, and all fighters around the world who are fighting for freedom and lofty principles, welcome the help and support given to Egypt by the Soviet Union. Egyptians and Arabs will forever remember this support given to them by the Soviet Union. They regard the Soviet Union as a sincere defender of the freedom and independence of all nations.

I should also gratefully point out the strong support and valuable assistance given to Egypt by the government and people of the People's Republic of China.

I should also be grateful for the support of the people's democratic countries, which condemned the imperialist aggression against our country and expressed their willingness to help us.

The failure of the imperialist attempt to militarily invade Egypt is a major victory for freedom-loving people around the world. In this victory, I would like to especially point out the great role of the Soviet Union, this noble role will be gloriously recorded in history.

    苏联是埃及人民的真正朋友
    埃及驻苏大使赞颂苏联对制止侵略的重大作用
    新华社15日讯　据塔斯社报道：埃及驻苏联大使穆罕默德·库尼13日晚间在莫斯科广播电台发表演说。他说，苏联永远赢得了埃及人民的心。巩固埃及和苏联之间的关系和加强两国之间合作的历史性的时刻已经到来了。在这个时刻，埃及知道谁是它的真正朋友。
    库尼说，苏联各族人民都同情埃及和支持埃及。塞得港的居民在苏联博得了像英雄城市斯大林格勒、列宁格勒的居民在全世界所博得的那种光荣和声誉。
    他说，在侵略者对埃及的背信弃义的阴谋显露出来以后，苏联政府声言，它相信埃及的力量，相信埃及将会取得胜利。苏联政府的这种立场加强了我国人民对他们为之奋斗的正义事业的信心，巩固了我国人民争取胜利的决心。
    埃及人民、全体阿拉伯国家的人民、全体东方人民以及世界各地一切为自由和崇高原则而奋斗的战士，都欢迎苏联给予埃及的帮助和支持。埃及人和阿拉伯人将永远记得苏联给予他们的这种支持。他们认为苏联是各国人民的自由和独立的真诚保卫者。
    我还应当感激地指出中华人民共和国政府和人民给予埃及的强大支持和宝贵的援助。
    我还应当感激人民民主国家的支持，它们谴责帝国主义对我国的侵略，并且表示愿意帮助我们。
    帝国主义武装侵略埃及的企图的失败是世界各地爱好自由人民的重大胜利。在这次胜利中，我愿意特别指出苏联的重大作用，这种崇高的作用将被光荣地载入史册。
