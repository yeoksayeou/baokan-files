Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, November 19th: The Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party organ, "People's Freedom," published the following official communiqué from the Hungarian Revolutionary Worker-Peasant Government on November 18th:

    Recently, hostile elements have been disrupting society by spreading all kinds of provocative and untrue rumors, attempting to create chaos. For example, they spread rumors that large-scale arrests are being carried out domestically, and that young people and others are being transported from the country to the Soviet Union.

    Due to the emergence of these absurd rumors, the government deems it necessary to make the following announcement to residents:

    Now, in order to safeguard the interests of the working people, the state power organs have the responsibility to arrest and eliminate counter-revolutionaries, terrorists, agitators against the social system, and armed bandits who occasionally appear at workplaces to obstruct the working people from going to work through threats and intimidation. Our state power organs are also ordered to eliminate looters, bandits, and other criminals who are still running rampant, hindering the restoration of the domestic legal system, and threatening social order, tranquility, and security.

    In order to complete this task thoroughly and as quickly as possible, our state power organs and public security forces have to make arrests.

    The disturbing rumor that those arrested are to be sent to the Soviet Union is a provocation concocted by those increasingly isolated and weakened counter-revolutionaries. In fact, not a single arrested person has been sent out of Hungary. The purpose of spreading this provocative rumor is, on the one hand, to incite distrust of the government and disrupt the tranquility of the residents and hinder production, and on the other hand, to attempt to damage the relationship between the residents and the Soviet troops.

    Regarding the arrests, it must also be explained that each arrested person will be carefully investigated separately. If it becomes clear that he has not committed a crime and has not engaged in activities that endanger society, then he will be released immediately.

    If, during the investigation, it is discovered that he has committed a serious crime, he will be handed over to the Hungarian competent authorities, the procuratorate, or the court for legal proceedings.

    The government calls on residents not to believe provocative statements and fabricated disturbing rumors, not to listen to those who spread rumors, to do everything possible to oppose them, and to seek assistance from the state power organs when necessary.

    匈牙利工农革命政府发表公报
    号召人民反对散播挑拨性言论和谣言的人  指出政府有责任逮捕和肃清反革命分子
    新华社布达佩斯19日电　匈牙利社会主义工人党机关报“人民自由报”11月18日刊载了匈牙利工农革命政府的正式公报如下：
    最近敌对分子用散布种种挑拨性的、不符合事实的谣言来扰乱社会，力图制造混乱。例如，他们散布谣言说，国内在进行大逮捕，把青年人和其他人从国内运往苏联。
    由于产生这些无稽的谣言，政府认为有必要对居民作下列通告：
    现在为了维护劳动人民的利益，政权机关有责任逮捕和肃清反革命分子、恐怖活动分子、反对社会制度的煽动者、时而出现在工作地点以威胁和恐吓来阻挠劳动人民上班工作的武装匪徒。我国政权机关也同样受命肃清还在胡作非为的抢劫者、匪徒和其他刑事犯，他们妨碍着国内法律制度的恢复，威胁着社会秩序、安宁和安全。
    为了尽可能快地彻底完成这一任务，我们的政权机关和维持治安的军队不得不进行逮捕。
    说什么被逮捕者要被送往苏联的这种扰乱人心的谣言，是那些越来越孤立无援和丧失力量的反革命分子臆造的挑拨。事实上没有一个被捕者被送出匈牙利。散布这种挑拨性谣言的目的，一方面是想引起大家对政府的不信任以及扰乱居民的安宁和妨碍生产，另一方面是企图以此来损害居民和苏军部队之间的关系。
    关于逮捕一事还必须说明，对每一个被捕的人要分别进行仔细的侦查。如果弄清楚了，他没有犯罪，没有进行危害社会的活动，那末他马上就会被释放。
    如果在侦查过程中发现，他犯了重大罪恶，为了进行法律审理，他就要被移交给匈牙利主管部门检察机关或法院。
    政府号召居民不要相信挑拨言论和捏造的扰乱人心的谣言，不要听信散播谣言的人的话，要竭力反对他们，在必要时可以向政权机关求助。　匈牙利工农革命政府
