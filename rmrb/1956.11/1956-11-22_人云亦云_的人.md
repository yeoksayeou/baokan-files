People Who Echo Others
Wang Quan, Zhang Defu

"Seeing is believing, hearing is deceiving." This saying tells us to observe things in depth and not to "listen one-sidedly" or "echo others." However, some cadres and young students from rural areas, after returning to their hometowns, only hear what some people say, without conducting thorough investigation and research, and completely believe it to be true, thus drawing one-sided or even wrong conclusions.

A staff member of a certain bureau of the Jilin Provincial People's Committee once did something rash.

His home is in Baishan Township, on the outskirts of Jilin City, and he has already joined an agricultural production cooperative. In July of this year, he went home once. He stayed at home for less than six hours, and after listening to some one-sided reflections from his family, he concluded that the cooperative was a complete mess. He wrote a "letter of opinion" full of complaints and grievances to the Rural Work Department of the Jilin Provincial Party Committee, saying: "After joining the cooperative, the farmers sighed and expressed dissatisfaction because their living standards are now much lower than before joining. The cooperative has money but does not pay the members; some members are in low spirits because of external debts. The cooperative cadres think that oxen pull carts slowly, so they sold the oxen and bought horses, reducing the animal power and using people to pull plows. The cooperative bought a large number of loudspeakers and built offices, spending a lot of money, violating the principle of running the cooperative diligently and frugally, and the masses have many opinions." He also said that "some members go to the fields hungry, and the agricultural science cadres are blind, only listening to the cooperative cadres' good news and not reporting the bad," and so on. This cadre was convinced that these situations were true and asked the provincial party committee to send someone to investigate and deal with them.

What is the truth? Let's take a look at the investigation materials from the Jilin City Rural Work Committee: "The income of the members has not decreased. From May to July, the cooperative has already advanced cash to the members four times, with an average of more than 120 yuan per member. Even the family of this staff member has advanced more than 153 yuan. The vast majority of members of the cooperative are satisfied." As for "selling oxen to buy horses, reducing animal power, and using people to pull plows," it turns out that this is what happened: when the cooperative was established, there were fifteen oxen; four of them were old, and one was sick and could not be used. The cooperative sold these four oxen, added the members' investment, and bought four horses and mules, and fourteen oxen. After the vegetables were transplanted, according to the local vegetable farmers' experience over the years, if the first weeding is done with animals, the seedlings will be trampled back and forth; therefore, people are used to pull the plow. The cooperative did not spend money to build offices and buy loudspeakers; the wired broadcasting was set up by the city. The newly established cooperative has many households (more than 500), and there are some households in difficulty, but they are not going to the fields hungry. Even if there are some difficulties, they are temporary and unavoidable, and efforts are being made to overcome them.

Let's take a look at this cadre's family: his family is relatively wealthy and relatively backward. In the early days of cooperation, his family was unwilling to join the cooperative. Later, seeing that the whole township had joined the cooperative, they reluctantly joined, and sold their large耕牛 before joining. After joining the cooperative, they were passive. They were asked to attend team meetings repeatedly but did not participate. Therefore, it was difficult for his family to understand the production and income of the cooperative clearly, and they mistakenly believed that their income had decreased after joining the cooperative. At this time, this cadre returned home; after hearing the one-sided reflections, he blindly echoed, "Income has decreased, the farmers are dissatisfied..."

In the face of irrefutable facts, what should this cadre think? What do people who have the same one-sided views as this cadre think?

    “人云亦云”的人
    王权　张德福
    “眼见是实，耳听是虚”，这句俗话告诉我们，要深入观察事物，不要“偏听偏信”“人云亦云”。可是，有一些家在农村的机关干部和青年学生，在回到家乡后，只听到某些人说了一些话，并没有切实调查研究，就完全信以为真，于是得出片面的甚至错误的结论。
    吉林省人民委员会某厅的一个工作人员，就曾经做了一件冒冒失失的事。
    他家住在吉林市郊的白山乡，已经加入了农业生产合作社。今年7月间，他曾经回家一趟。他在家呆了还不到六个小时，听了家里人一些片面的反映，就断定合作社办得一塌糊涂。他给中共吉林省委农村工作部写了一封怨言连篇、满腹牢骚的“意见书”，里面说：“农民入社后，都唉声叹气，表示不满。因为他们现在的生活水平比入社前大大降低了。社里有钱不给社员支；有的社员因有外欠，情绪不高。社干部认为牛拉车慢，卖了牛买马，畜力减少，用人拉犁。社里大量购买扩音器，又修办公室，花了很多钱，违背勤俭办社原则，群众意见纷纷。”还说“有的社员饿肚下地，农业科干部是瞎眼，只听社干部报喜不报忧”等等。这个干部满以为这些情况是真实的，便要求省委派人调查处理。
    事实是怎样的呢？让我们看看吉林市委农村工作委员会的调查材料吧：“社员收入并没减少。从5月到7月，社里已预支给社员四次现金，每个社员平均支到一百二十多元。就是这位工作人员的家庭，也预支了一百五十三元多。社里绝大多数社员都感到满意。”至于“卖了牛买马，畜力减少，用人拉犁”等等，原来是这末一回事：建社的时候，社里有十五头牛；其中有三头老的、一头病的，不能使用。社里把这四头牛卖掉，加上社员的投资，买进了四匹马、骡、十四头牛。蔬菜定植以后，根据当地菜农历年经验，趟头遍地如果就用牲口拉，来回要踩苗；因此才用人拉。社里并没有花钱修办公室和买扩音器，有线广播是市里设立的。新建的社，户数又多（五百多户），困难户是有的，但并没有饿着肚子下地干活的。即使有些困难，也是暂时的，难免的，而且正在努力克服。
    再让我们看看这位干部的家庭吧：他的家庭是比较富裕的，也是比较落后的。在合作化初期，他家里的人不愿意参加合作社。后来，看到全乡都入社了，才勉强加入，并且在加入前把大耕牛卖掉了。入社以后，表现消极。队里开会，三番五次请也不参加。因此，他家里的人对社里的生产、收支等情况就很难了解清楚，误认为入社后收入减少了。就在这个时候，这个工作人员回到了家里；他听到片面的反映以后，也就盲目地跟着喊起“收入减少，农民不满……”。
    在无可辩驳的事实面前，这位干部不知该作何感想？与这位干部有同样片面看法的人，又有什么感想呢？
