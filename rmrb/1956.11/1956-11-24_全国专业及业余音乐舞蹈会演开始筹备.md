Preparations have begun for the National Professional and Amateur Music and Dance Performance, scheduled to be held in early 1957. The preparatory work for the performance is underway, based on the "Joint Notice Regarding Holding the National Professional and Amateur Music and Dance Art Performance in Beijing in 1957" issued in September by the Ministry of Culture of the People's Republic of China, the Nationalities Affairs Commission of the People's Republic of China, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League.

This performance aims to promote the excellent heritage of China's national folk music and dance art, exchange the working experience of music and dance performance groups, so as to further promote the development of China's music and dance cause and enrich China's mass amateur music and dance art activities. In addition, it is also planned to select a group of excellent programs and musical and dance performance talents through the performance to participate in the artistic activities of the "6th World Youth and Student Peace and Friendship Festival" to be held in Moscow in July 1957.

The performance will be divided into two parts: the "National Professional Troupe Music and Dance Performance" will be held in early January 1957; the "Second National Folk Music and Dance Performance" will be held in early March 1957.

In order to enable comrades responsible for music and dance work in various places to fully exchange opinions on issues such as the development plan of local song and dance undertakings, the inheritance and promotion of national song and dance heritage, the guiding principles and tasks of song and dance troupes, and the direction of development, the Ministry of Culture plans to hold a symposium on the work of song and dance troupes after the performance of professional troupes, and has issued a notice in October asking various places to make preparations. At present, the office of the National Professional Troupe Music and Dance Performance and the Second National Folk Music and Dance Performance has been established. The office already has dedicated personnel collecting relevant information on song and dance work issues and conducting research.

    全国专业及业余音乐舞蹈会演开始筹备
    本报讯　全国专业及业余音乐舞蹈会演，将于1957年初举行。会演的筹备工作，根据中华人民共和国文化部、中华人民共和国民族事务委员会、中华全国总工会、中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会在九月份发出的“关于1957年在北京举办全国专业及业余音乐舞蹈艺术会演的联合通知”，目前正在进行中。
    这次会演，是为了发扬我国民族民间音乐舞蹈艺术的优秀遗产，交流音乐舞蹈演出团体的工作经验，以推动我国音乐舞蹈事业进一步发展，繁荣我国群众业余音乐舞蹈艺术活动。此外，还准备通过会演选拔一批优秀节目和音乐、舞蹈表演人材，参加1957年7月在莫斯科举行的“第六届世界青年与学生和平友谊联欢节”的艺术活动。
    会演将分为两部分：1957年1月上旬举行“全国专业团体音乐舞蹈会演”；1957年3月上旬举行“第二届全国民间音乐舞蹈会演”。
    为了使各地负责音乐舞蹈工作的同志，就各地歌舞事业的发展规划、继承和发扬民族歌舞遗产问题、歌舞团的方针任务及发展方向等问题充分交换意见，文化部准备在专业团体的会演之后召开歌舞团工作座谈会，并且已在十月份发出通知，请各地进行准备。目前全国专业团体音乐舞蹈会演，第二届全国民间音乐舞蹈会演办公室已经成立。办公室已有专人在搜集有关歌舞工作问题的资料，并进行研究。
