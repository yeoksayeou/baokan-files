Polish "People's Tribune" Reporter Reports
    Hungarian Reactionary Forces Active
    Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, November 3rd. An article by the "People's Tribune's" Budapest correspondent commenting on the Hungarian situation says that in Hungary, riotous actions are becoming increasingly obvious, such as looting, atrocities (especially in Buda), and so on. On the one hand, it should be seen that Hungarians generally have the determination to end this phenomenon. On the other hand, it must be pointed out that some people are trying to restore some small fascist groups. The attitude of various political parties towards the mass movement is increasingly attracting attention. It is worth noting that in the movement carried out by the Smallholders Party in Budapest, there are already plans to offer compensation to the expropriated factory owners. At the same time, the Social Democratic Party does not even conceal its connections with foreign countries. Anna Kéthly has gone to Vienna as a special representative of the newly established Central Committee of the Social Democratic Party. It should not be forgotten that Western reactionary groups have certain hopes for the situation in Hungary. In this regard, Cardinal Mindszenty has also received considerable attention. There are plans to establish a Catholic party with a monarchist flavor.

    波兰“人民论坛报”记者报道
    匈牙利反动势力活跃
    新华社华沙3日电　“人民论坛报”刊登它的驻布达佩斯记者的一篇评述匈牙利局势的文章说，在匈牙利，暴乱行动已经是越来越明显了，例如抢劫、虐杀（特别是在布达）以及其他等等。一方面应该看到，目前匈牙利人普遍有决心结束这种现象，另一方面也必须指出，有人企图恢复一些小型的法西斯主义集团。各政党对于群众运动究竟采取什么态度，越来越使人注意。值得注意的是，在布达佩斯的小农党所进行的运动中，目前就已经谈到了向被剥夺的工厂厂主提出赔偿的计划。同时，社会党也甚至毫不隐讳它同外国所保持的联系。安娜·克提以新成立的社会民主党中央委员会特派代表的身分到维也纳去了。不可忘记西方反动集团对于匈牙利局势所抱的一定的希望。关于这一点，红衣主教明曾蒂这个人也受到了相当重视。有人计划成立具有保皇主义气味的天主教党。
