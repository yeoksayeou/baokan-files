Xinhua News Agency, Jiangling, 18th. The CCP Jingzhou Prefectural Committee of Hubei Province held a telephone conference with the various county committees on the 16th, instructing local Party organizations to strengthen their leadership over the work of increasing production and practicing economy, to widely carry out propaganda and education on "running cooperatives diligently and thriftily" and "managing households diligently and thriftily," to guide the peasant masses to correctly arrange their family life, and to prevent the phenomenon of extravagance, waste, and squandering of money from occurring in rural areas after a bumper harvest.

The Jianghan Plain has achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest this year. Cotton production has increased by 47% compared to last year, and rice production has increased by 16% compared to last year. The income of agricultural cooperative members has greatly increased. However, due to the relaxation of political work on diligently running cooperatives, increasing production, and practicing economy, the trend of extravagance and waste has begun to rise again in some rural areas since the autumn harvest. For example, many farmers widely collect gifts and lavishly entertain guests when holding weddings and funerals. According to a survey of 184 households in the Qianjin Cooperative of Fenyan Township, Jianli County, 50 households spent a total of 9,350 yuan on celebrating children's birthdays, arranging engagements or weddings for their children, or celebrating birthdays for the elderly, accounting for 11% of the cooperative's total annual income from agriculture and sideline occupations. When Wang Liangwen, the accountant of the Heping Cooperative in Guanyin Township, Qianjiang County, got married, the man and woman sides invited more than 400 guests, spending more than 300 yuan and using more than 250 catties of grain. Sun Chuanfang, the director of the Xincheng Cooperative in Xinkou Township, Gong'an County, hired a Taoist priest to perform a religious ceremony at his home for his deceased grandmother for two days and three nights, spending more than 200 yuan. As a result of such extravagance and heavy eating and drinking, not only did the parties involved in weddings and funerals spend too much, causing economic difficulties, but even relatives and neighbors were affected in their future lives because of giving gifts. Zhou Kenian's mother, a member of the Qianjin Cooperative in Jianli County, raised a fat pig and sold it for 107 yuan. She spent 97 yuan on gifts within a month, leaving her with only 10 yuan.

Some agricultural cooperative members lacked planning for their daily family life after the autumn harvest distribution, buying many non-essential items and even squandering money, resulting in waste. The masses in Caifeng Township, Jiangling County, newly bought 192 coffins. Xu Chuanxiang, who is only 35 years old this year, also spent 60 yuan to buy a coffin to store away. Some cooperative members ran to the city to stay in hotels, watch operas, and eat in restaurants after receiving money from the agricultural cooperative, spending it arbitrarily. Zeng Xinmin, a member of the Qiaoyin Cooperative in Tanqiao Township, received 60 yuan in distribution and went to Shashi to stay in a hotel and have fun for two days. He spent all 60 yuan on gold teeth and watching operas, and is now experiencing economic difficulties.

Many agricultural cooperative cadres also believed that this year's harvest was a bumper one and forgot the policy of "running cooperatives diligently and thriftily," resulting in indiscriminate spending. After the autumn harvest, the cadres of the Zheng Bating Agricultural Cooperative in Zhengda Township, Honghu County, were busy allocating 1,500 yuan to build a warehouse before the cooperative members' urgently needed pocket money had been distributed. The Xinmin Second Cooperative in Xinmin Township, Jiangling County, spent 600 yuan to build an accountant's office specifically for the accountant. The Xinle and Gongnong Agricultural Cooperatives in Xinguo Township, Gong'an County, sent people to Changsha, Hunan, to buy opera costumes for 680 yuan; however, these two cooperatives still owe the state more than 2,000 yuan in loans and are delaying repayment. Gong'an County has also recently discovered that some agricultural cooperatives are using the excuse of "celebrating the bumper harvest" to invite Taoist priests to "hold rituals" to promote superstitious ideas. The Second Production Team of the Shengli Cooperative in Lei Si Township invited two Taoist priests to perform "Taiping rituals" for two or three days, with the 20 households in the team contributing a total of 44 yuan, and also wasting hundreds of catties of grain.

The Jingzhou Prefectural Committee pointed out that although this phenomenon of extravagance and wanton squandering is currently limited to some rural areas and a small number of farmers, if the leading organs and rural branches at all levels relax their leadership and allow this situation to develop, it will become even more serious. Recently, agricultural cooperatives in various places have been selling cotton and surplus grain in large quantities, and the fruits of the members' labor for the year are about to be fully distributed to households. Truly caring about the lives of the masses requires not only leading the peasants to develop production and increase income, but also further guiding the masses to better arrange their family economic lives and helping agricultural cooperatives to do a good job in financial expenditure plans and carry out production and cultural construction within their capabilities.

Currently, various counties in the Jingzhou Special District are holding county-wide three-level cadre meetings, and the issue of implementing the policy of increasing production and practicing economy and running cooperatives diligently and thriftily has been included in the agenda of the cadre meetings in various counties. The Jingzhou Prefectural Committee requires that through the more than 10,000 rural cadres participating in the meetings throughout the district, a political education campaign against extravagance and waste should be widely and deeply carried out in the vast rural areas immediately.

### 向农民宣传“勤俭办社”“勤俭理家”  中共荆州地委号召全区注意防止铺张浪费

    向农民宣传“勤俭办社”“勤俭理家”
    中共荆州地委号召全区注意防止铺张浪费
    新华社江陵18日电　中共湖北省荆州地方委员会在16日和各县委举行了一次电话会议，指示各地党组织加强对增产节约工作的领导，广泛开展“勤俭办社”和“勤俭理家”的宣传教育，指导农民群众正确地安排家庭生活，防止农村丰收以后发生铺张浪费、挥霍金钱的现象。
    江汉平原今年获得了空前丰收，棉花比去年增产47％，稻谷比去年增产16％，农业社社员的收入都大大增加了。但各地由于对勤俭办社、增产节约的政治工作放松了领导，秋收以来部分农村铺张浪费的风气又开始抬头。例如，许多农户在办理婚、丧事时，广收人情，大请宾客。据监利县分盐乡前进社一百八十四户社员中调查，就有五十户为小孩子过周岁、为子女订婚、结婚或为老人做寿，请客和送人情共花费了九千三百五十元，占这个社全年农业和副业总收入的11％。潜江县观音乡和平社的会计王良文结婚时，男方和女方共请了四百多个客人，花了三百多元，用去粮食二百五十斤以上。公安县新口乡新成社主任孙传芳，请道士到家为死去的祖母作斋念经两天三夜，花了二百多元。这样铺张浪费、大吃大喝的结果，不仅办婚、丧的事主花费过多，造成经济困难，连亲朋邻舍因为送人情也影响了今后生活。监利县前进社社员周科年的母亲喂了一头肥猪，卖了一百零七元，在一个月内光送人情就用去九十七元，自己只落得十元钱。
    有些农业社社员在秋收分配以后对家庭的日常生活缺乏计划，买了许多非急需的用品，甚至挥霍金钱，造成浪费。江陵县裁缝乡群众新买了一百九十二口棺材，许传香今年只三十五岁，也花六十元买了一口棺材存放起来。有些社员从农业社领到钱，就跑到城里住旅馆，看戏、下馆子，任意挥霍。滩桥乡桥银社社员曾新民分了六十元，到沙市去住旅馆连玩了两天，又镶金牙又看戏，把六十元花光了，目前生活已经发生困难。
    许多农业社的干部也认为今年丰收了，忘记了“勤俭办社”的方针，滥行开支。洪湖县郑大乡郑八厅农业社秋收后，社员们迫切需要的零花钱还没有分，社干部就忙着拨款一千五百元修建一座仓库。江凌县新民乡新民二社支出六百元专为会计盖了一个会计办公室。公安县新国乡新乐、工农两个农业社，派人到湖南长沙用六百八十元去买唱戏的服装；可是，这两个社至今还欠国家贷款二千多元，拖着不还。公安县最近还发现有些农业社借口“庆祝丰收”请道士“打醮”宣传迷信思想。雷四乡胜利社第二生产队，请了两个道士连打两三天的“太平醮”，全队二十户社员共出钱四十四元，还浪费了几百斤的粮食。
    荆州地委指出：这种铺张浪费、恣意挥霍的现象，目前虽然还只限于部分农村和少数农户，但是，如果各级领导机关和乡村支部放松领导，任凭这种情况发展下去，就将更加严重。近来，各地农业社正在大批出售棉花和余粮，社员们一年的劳动果实即将全部分配到户。真正关心群众生活，不仅要领导农民发展生产、增加收入，还要进一步地指导群众把家庭经济生活安排得更好，帮助农业社搞好财务开支计划，量力而行地进行生产、文化建设。
    目前，荆州专区各县正在召开全县三级干部会议，贯彻增产节约和勤俭办社方针的问题已列入各县干部会议的议程。荆州地委要求通过全区参加会议的一万多名农村干部，立即在广大农村中广泛深入地开展一次反对铺张浪费的政治教育工作。
