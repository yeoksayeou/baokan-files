Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, November 27th: After many rural branches of the Chinese Communist Party in Jianping County established a sound Party Committee system, they further strengthened their leadership over agricultural production cooperatives. After the establishment of the Party Committee system in the county's rural branches, the leadership core of the branches became stronger, capable of independently implementing policies and completing tasks, and running the cooperatives well. By mid-November, the number of Class One branches, where Party members had a high level of socialist consciousness and could play an exemplary role, had increased to 37%. The Changsang Village Party Branch of the Chinese Communist Party previously had an unsound Party Committee system, and the leadership core of the branch had not been formed, so much of the work was not done well. In early October, with the help of the superior Party organization, the Changsang Village Party Branch examined its past work and established a system for leading the agricultural cooperative, which transformed its past backwardness. When carrying out autumn plowing and wheat planting, the branch discussed it and each branch committee member mobilized the masses according to their division of labor. In forty days, they not only completed autumn plowing and wheat planting in a timely manner, obtained more than 700 yuan in sideline income, and also harvested 30,000 catties of fodder. In the township-wide production competition and evaluation, this branch won the Red Flag.

After seventeen Chinese Communist Party branches in six townships, including Mengjiazhuang and Pangjiapu, established a sound Party Committee system, the phenomenon of disunity was also eliminated. The Xigou Village Party Branch of the Chinese Communist Party previously had an unsound Party Committee system. When discussing issues within the cooperative, branch committee members often held their own opinions and engaged in localism, which affected production. Since the establishment of a sound Party Committee system in early October, the branch has discussed the work of the cooperative once every half month, and has led Party members in three Party lessons and two criticism meetings in a month and a half. Many differences of opinion among Party members and cadres were resolved through discussion, and most Party members were able to play a leading role, so the autumn harvest distribution, grain purchase, and election work within the cooperative were completed on schedule.

After some village party branches established a sound Party Committee system, they assigned specific personnel to lead the Party's organizational and educational work, and the Party's ideological education of Party members was also strengthened compared to before. Before Tangjiahui and Qingshuikou townships established a sound Party Committee system, only thirteen branches had sound Party education systems; after establishing a sound Party Committee system in October, the number increased to thirty-seven. In this way, some shortcomings and mistakes existing in Party members can be corrected in a timely manner.

    建屏县农村支部健全党委制后
    加强了对农业社的领导
    新华社保定27日电　中共建屏县农村的许多支部健全党委制后，进一步加强了对农业生产合作社的领导。全县农村支部在健全党委制后，支部领导核心坚强，能独立贯彻政策、完成任务，把社办好，党员社会主义觉悟高、能起模范带头作用的一类支部，到11月中旬已增到37％。中共长桑村支部过去党委制不健全，支部领导核心没有形成，许多工作做得不好。10月初长桑村党支部在上级党组织的帮助下，检查了过去的工作，建立起对农业社的领导制度，便转变了过去的落后面貌。在进行秋耕种麦等工作时，支部研究讨论后由各个支部委员按照分工分别发动群众，四十天中，不仅及时完成了秋耕种麦，获得七百多元的副业收入，并且打了三万斤饲草。在全乡生产竞赛评比时，这个支部夺到了流动红旗。
    孟家庄、庞家铺等六个乡的十七个中共支部健全了党委制后，不团结的现象也消除了。中共西沟村支部过去党委制不健全，在商量社内问题时，支部委员常各持己见，闹本位主义，因而影响了生产。自十月初健全了党委制，支部每半月讨论一次社内工作，一个半月领导党员上了三次党课，开了两次批评会，党员干部之间许多分歧意见，经过讨论统一了认识，多数党员能起带头作用，社内的秋收分配、粮食征购和选举工作便都按期作好。
    有些村的党支部健全了党委制，确定专人领导党的组织教育工作，党对党员的思想教育也较前加强了。唐家会、青水口四个乡未健全党委制以前，党的教育制度健全的支部只有十三个，10月份健全党委制以后，便增到了三十七个。这样，有些党员存在的缺点错误也能及时纠正。
