Xinhua News Agency, Prague, November 11th -- According to a report by the Czechoslovak News Agency on the 9th, a weaving factory equipped with jet looms has recently been put into production in Semily, Liberec Region.

    These looms operate silently, have a beautiful appearance, and create a pleasant working atmosphere in the workshop.

    These looms weave three hundred and fifty times per minute and can produce ten meters of textiles per hour, which is more than twice the output of semi-automatic looms. Tests have shown that jet looms are best suited for weaving high-quality textiles using materials such as "Silon" and "Panlon."

    捷首批喷气织布机投入生产
    它运转时没有声响，每分钟摆动三百五十次
    新华社布拉格11日电　据捷克斯洛伐克通讯社9日报道：一个安装有喷气织布机的织布厂最近在列勃里兹州塞米利城投入生产。
    这种织布机运转时没有声响，外表很美观，使车间里具有一种愉快的工作气氛。
    这种织布机每分钟摆动三百五十次，每小时能织十公尺纺织品，等于半自动化织布机产量的两倍以上。试验证明，喷气织布机最适宜于用“西龙”、“潘龙”等材料来织上等纺织品。
