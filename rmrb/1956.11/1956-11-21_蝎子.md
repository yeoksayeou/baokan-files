    Scorpion
    Jia Zuzhang
    Scorpions are in the same family as spiders, just as shrimp are in the same family as crabs. A scorpion's body is long, while a spider's body is short. The bodies of both scorpions and spiders can be divided into two parts: the cephalothorax and the abdomen, just like shrimp and crabs.

    The scorpion's cephalothorax has organs such as the mouth, eyes, and legs. Beside the mouth are a pair of large chelicerae, which are two very small pincers; there is also a pair of pedipalps, which are larger than the chelicerae, resembling two plump, short shrimp claws, and are specifically called pedipalps. The eyes are small and inconspicuous. There are a total of four pairs of legs.

    The abdomen is divided into two parts: the preabdomen and the postabdomen. The preabdomen consists of seven segments and is relatively flat and broad. The postabdomen is nearly cylindrical, consisting of six segments, with the terminal segment shaped like a peach. It has a sharp hook containing a pair of venom glands, called the stinger. Scorpions often use the stinger to sting small insects for food. A person stung by it will also feel severe pain.

    The venom in the stinger is transparent like water, shows an acidic reaction, and under a microscope, it appears to contain abnormally fine particles. The chemical nature of the venom is not yet clear, but it is certain that it is not protein.

    Scorpion venom, like snake venom, can be neutralized with antivenom. Moreover, different types of scorpions require the production of different types of antivenom. For general treatment, the area above the wound should be tied tightly, then the venom should be sucked out, and ammonia or calcium chloride should be applied. In Northeast China, it is customary to apply brown sugar to the affected area. It is said that applying snail mucus or soaking the affected area in warm water for a long time can easily relieve the pain.

    Sima Guang, the compiler of the Zizhi Tongjian (Comprehensive Mirror to Aid in Government), once wrote an article recording that one night, his hand was stung by a scorpion, and the pain was unbearable. His family invited a shaman, who said to him: "Don't think that the scorpion is capable of stinging people. You should think that the scorpion is a small insect, how can it make me hurt?" Sima Guang listened to his words, and after a while, he no longer felt pain. Sima Guang thanked the shaman, who said: "The scorpion did not make you hurt, it is you yourself who thought it would hurt when stung; I did not make you not hurt, it is you yourself who thought the pain had disappeared." This is indeed a lovely shaman, because he did not seek help from gods and ghosts. However, saying that pain and non-pain are purely subjective is a thoroughgoing form of idealism.

    The scorpion is a poisonous animal, so in the old days, it was combined with snakes, geckos, centipedes, and spiders and called the Five Poisons. However, non-poisonous snakes and geckos are actually not poisonous. These five kinds of animals all catch small insects and small animals, and except for poisonous snakes, it would be more appropriate to call them all beneficial insects.

    Scorpions live in dry places and also lurk in houses. They hide under rocks, dead leaves, etc., during the day and come out at night. When walking, they extend their two pedipalps flatly in front, and their tail is raised upward, somewhat like a sailboat sailing on the water.

    According to the observations of the famous French entomologist Fabre, when scorpions in France mate, the male and female scorpion first stand head-to-head, with their tails raised upward, and the stingers at the end of the tails touch each other. Then the male scorpion pulls the female scorpion, and the female scorpion retreats backward, and the male scorpion follows and pulls it back again. They retreat and advance in this way, as if dancing. After about an hour, the male scorpion leads the female scorpion to a secluded place for mating. After mating, the female scorpion often eats the male scorpion.

    When the scorpion's eggs are laid, they are wrapped in fully developed small scorpions. The mother scorpion carefully breaks the eggshell and releases the white little scorpions. The little scorpions temporarily gather on the mother scorpion's back and are protected by the mother scorpion. In the first week, the little scorpions do not eat anything, but they grow larger. Later, they shed their skin once, and their bodies become larger, able to crawl on the mother scorpion's back and share the mother scorpion's food. After shedding their skin several more times, they begin to live independently. When they first leave their mother's back, they still follow the mother scorpion, and when they encounter danger, they still climb onto their mother's back.

    Scorpions in our country also have the habit of carrying their young on their backs. During the Tang Dynasty, Duan Chengshi already made a record in his "Youyang Zazu" based on field observations. He said: "Scorpions often carry many young on their backs. Chengshi once saw a scorpion carrying more than ten young, the young were still white in color, only as big as rice grains." More than a thousand years ago, our country had such a detailed description of the life habits of scorpions, which is very valuable.

    Scorpions have been used in medicine for a long time, mainly to treat infantile convulsions, leukorrhea, carbuncles, and other ailments. Li Shizhen's Compendium of Materia Medica says: "Now, in medicine, there are those who use the whole scorpion, called the whole scorpion; and those who use the tail, called the scorpion tip, which is especially potent." It also says: "For medicinal use, remove the feet and bake." This kind of medicinal material is produced in Shandong (Qingzhou), Henan (Bianluo), and other places, and when captured, it is killed and dried with slow fire or in the hot sun.

    In the past two or three years, traditional Chinese medicine has used whole scorpions in combination with gypsum and other drugs to cure epidemic encephalitis B (cerebral encephalitis) that Western medicine cannot treat, confirming the old saying that it treats infantile convulsions. This undoubtedly greatly increases the need for this medicinal material, the scorpion. According to recent reports, three agricultural production cooperatives, including Liujiatun Village in Shihuyao Village, Jin County, in the Lushun-Dalian area, built 25 scorpion-breeding rooms in July, and placed 150 catties of scorpions in these breeding rooms, expecting to produce 2,500 catties of scorpions after one year. This is a new type of rural production undertaking.

    In the Northeast, the production of scorpions was originally quite large. It is said that there was a year when scorpions gathered on the railway lines, even causing difficulties for the passage of trains. In places where scorpions are so abundant, it should be possible to raise scorpions.

    However, scorpions must prey on various small insects to grow up. How to provide food for many scorpions raised together is worth studying.

    One hundred and fifty catties of scorpions are raised separately in twenty-five rooms, with six catties in each room. One catty of scorpions should have dozens of scorpions, and six catties would be two or three hundred. If so many scorpions are raised together, and if the Northeast originally had the habit of raising scorpions, then based on past experience, raising them should be successful. If it is a newly created undertaking, then this should only be regarded as a trial. Animal scientists should go to conduct on-the-spot investigations and research to provide breeders with powerful assistance.

    蝎子
    贾祖璋
    蝎子跟蜘蛛同类，正像虾跟蟹同类一样，蝎子的身体是长形的，而蜘蛛的身体是短形的。蝎子和蜘蛛的身体都可以分为头胸部和腹部两部分，也跟虾和蟹相同。
    蝎子的头胸部生有口、眼、脚等器官。口旁生有一对大颚，是两把极小的钳；还有一对小颚，形状要比大颚大，好像两只肥壮粗短的虾钳，特称触脚。眼小，不引人注意。脚一共四对。
    腹部分为前后两部分，前腹部由七个环节构成，比较扁阔。后腹部近乎圆筒形，由六个环节构成，末节呈桃子形，有一个尖锐的钩，里面含有一对毒腺，这称为毒钩。蝎子常用毒钩刺螫充作食物的小虫。人被刺着也要感到剧痛。
    毒钩里的毒液透明像水，呈酸性反应，在显微镜下看起来含有异常微细的颗粒。毒液的化学性质尚未明白，但可以确定它不是蛋白质。
    蝎子的毒跟蛇毒一样，可以用抗毒血清来中和。而且蝎子的种类不同，要分别制造不同种的抗毒血清来应用。一般治疗，宜把受伤部分的上方札紧，然后吸出毒液，涂抹氨水或注射氯化钙。东北地方习惯用红糖涂抹患处，传说涂抹蜗牛的粘液，或把患处长时间浸在温水里，都容易止痛。
    编写资治通鉴的司马光，曾有一篇文章，记载他有一天晚上，手给蝎子螫了，痛得不可忍耐。家里人请来了巫师，巫师对他说：“你不要以为蝎子是能够刺人的。你应该这样想，蝎子是一条小虫，怎么能够使我痛。”司马光听了他的话，过一会就不痛了。司马光向巫师致谢，巫师说：“蝎子并没有使你痛，是你自己以为螫了就痛；我也没有使你不痛，是你自己以为痛已消失。”这倒是一位可爱的巫师，因为他并没有求神祷鬼。但是说痛和不痛纯粹是主观作用，却是道地的唯心主义者。
    蝎子是一种有毒的动物，所以旧时把它跟蛇、壁虎、蜈蚣和蜘蛛合称五毒。但是无毒蛇和壁虎其实并没有毒。这五种动物都会捕捉小虫和小动物，除了毒蛇以外，说它们同是益虫，倒更适切。
    蝎子栖息在干燥的地方，也潜伏在家屋内。白天隐伏在石块、枯叶等下面，夜间出来活动。行走时，两只触脚平平地伸在前方，尾部向上翘起，有点像帆船在水面上行驶。
    依据法国著名的昆虫学家法布尔的观察，法国产的蝎子，交配时，雄蝎跟雌蝎先是头对头的站着，尾部向上翘起，尾端的毒钩互相触及。于是雄蝎拉住雌蝎，雌蝎向后退，雄蝎跟过去，又把它拉过来，就这样一退一进，好像舞蹈。大约经过一小时，雄蝎把雌蝎引到隐僻的地方，进行交配。交配以后，雌蝎往往就把雄蝎吃了。
    蝎子的卵产出时里面包着发育完全的小蝎子，母蝎仔细地把卵壳弄破，就放出白白的小蝎子来。小蝎子暂时聚集在母蝎背上，受到母蝎的保护。在第一周内，小蝎子不吃东西，但也会长大。后来脱一次皮，身体就更大一些，能够在母蝎背上爬行，而且分吃母蝎的食物。以后再脱几次皮，才开始过独立生活。初离开母背的时候，还是跟着母蝎行走，遇到危险，仍然爬上母背。
    我国产的蝎子也有负子的习性，唐代段成式已经根据实地观察，在他的“酉阳杂俎”里作了记载。他说：“蝎，子多负于背。成式尝见一蝎负十余子，子色犹白，才如稻粒。”在一千余年前，我国对于蝎子的生活习性，已经有这样仔细的描写，那是很可宝贵的。
    蝎子很早就供药用，主治惊风抽搐、带下、疮毒等症。李时珍本草纲目说：“今入药有全用者，谓之全蝎；有用尾者，谓之蝎稍，其力尤紧。”又说：“入药去足焙用。”这种出产药材在山东（青州）、河南（汴洛）等地，捕得时用慢火或烈日逼死烘干。
    近两三年来，中医用全蝎配合石膏等药物，治愈了西医无法治疗的流行性乙型脑炎（大脑炎），旧说主治惊风抽搐被证实了。这样对于蝎子这种药物的需要，无疑是要大为增加的。近日报载，旅大地区的金县石灰窑村刘家屯等三个农业生产合作社，在七月里修成了二十五间养蝎房，在这些养蝎房里放入了一百五十斤蝎子，预计一年以后可以出产蝎子二千五百斤。这倒是一种新的农村生产事业。
    在东北，出产蝎子原本不少。据说过去曾经有一年，蝎子聚集在铁路线上，甚至给火车的通行造成了困难。在蝎子这样繁多的地方，饲养蝎子应该是可能的。
    但是蝎子必须捕食各种小虫才能长大，许多蝎子养在一起，食料如何供给，值得研究。
    一百五十斤蝎子分养在二十五间屋子里，每间屋子就有六斤。一斤蝎子该有几十只吧，六斤就是二三百只了。这许多蝎子同养在一起，假使东北原来有饲养蝎子的习惯，那末依据过去的经验，饲养自然可以成功。假使是新创的事业，那末这还应该只作为试养。动物学者能够去实地考察一下，研究一下，可给饲养者以有力的帮助。
