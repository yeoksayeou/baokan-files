Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, 20th - The Chinese People's Liberation Army Fujian Front troops, in the intervals of their intense work, collect scrap steel and other metals to support the country's socialist construction. According to preliminary statistics from the logistics department, in the past nine months, they have turned over to the state 95 tons of scrap steel, 60 tons of scrap iron, and 1.7 tons of scrap non-ferrous metals.

　　The commanders and fighters of the troops guarding Jiaoyu Island, only four thousand meters away from Kinmen, under the slogan "What can you do for the country's socialist construction?", go to ditches and mountain tops to collect artillery shell fragments after each Chiang Kai-shek army shelling, and then transport them back to the mainland. The troops stationed in the Xiamen area have collected more than 9,000 jin of scrap metal such as artillery shell fragments and bullet casings in more than ten months, utilizing combat and training intervals. Officers, soldiers and workers of the motor vehicle repair shops and ship repair yards affiliated to the logistics department have collected 56 tons of scrap steel such as old machines and discarded equipment since the beginning of spring. Many troops have also collected discarded kitchen knives, fire pokers, iron buckets and other ironware and turned them over to the state.

　　The leading organs of the Fujian Front troops recently issued a circular commending the units that earnestly collected scrap metal.

    福建前线部队
    收集废钢铁支援祖国建设
    新华社福建前线20日电　中国人民解放军福建前线各部队在紧张工作的空隙，收集废钢铁等金属，支援国家的社会主义建设。据后勤部门初步统计，在最近九个月中，先后上缴国家的有废钢九十五吨，废铁六十吨，废有色金属一点七吨。
    守卫在离金门只有四千公尺的角屿岛上的部队的指战员们，在
  “你为祖国的社会主义建设做些什么”的口号下，每当蒋军炮击以后就到沟渠、山顶收集炮弹片，再把它们运回大陆。驻厦门地区的部队十多个月中利用战斗和训练间隙，收集的炮弹片、子弹壳等废金属共有九千多斤。后勤部门所属汽车修理厂和修船厂等单位的官兵和工人，入春以来收集了破旧机器、报废器材等废钢铁五十六吨。许多部队还把报废的菜刀、火箝、铁桶等铁器收集起来缴给国家。
    福建前线部队领导机关最近通报表扬了认真收集废金属的单位。
