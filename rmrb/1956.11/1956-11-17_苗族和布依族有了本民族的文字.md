Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang: The initial creation of the Miao language script has been successful. The Scientific Discussion Meeting on Miao Language and Writing Issues, held in Guiyang from October 31st to November 7th, passed resolutions after enthusiastic discussion to create three Miao scripts and reform one Miao script. From now on, the more than 2.5 million Miao people, distributed across seven provinces and with a history of more than 2,000 years, will have their own national script. This meeting was convened by the Guizhou Provincial People's Committee at the request of the Ethnic Affairs Commission of the People's Republic of China. During the meeting, Yin Yuran, Director of the Preparatory Office of the Institute of Minority Languages of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Soviet linguist Serdyuchenko, delivered comprehensive and insightful reports on language science and the creation of Miao scripts, which were warmly welcomed by all the representatives.

Also, Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang: The Scientific Discussion Meeting on Buyi Language and Writing Issues, held in Guiyang City from November 4th to 7th, passed the "Buyi Language Writing Scheme" (draft). From now on, the Buyi people will have their own national script.

The Buyi population is 1.25 million, residing in the river valleys and mountainous areas of southern Guizhou Province, connected to the Zhuang areas of Guangxi Province, and engaged in agricultural production. According to the survey materials of the First Working Team for Minority Language Investigation of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Buyi language and the Zhuang language are closely related and belong to the same language branch. Therefore, in order to facilitate cultural exchange and contact, the meeting, after enthusiastic discussion, decided to adopt the policy of establishing a writing alliance between the Buyi and Zhuang scripts. The Buyi script should be as consistent as possible with the Zhuang script in terms of letter forms, spelling rules, and language norms, but also take into account the characteristics of the Buyi language, so as to facilitate the learning and use by the Buyi people.

The meeting suggested that the Guizhou Provincial Ethnic Language Steering Committee should frequently contact the Guangxi Zhuang Language Writing Research Steering Committee to discuss specific issues related to the common development of Buyi and Zhuang scripts, so as to gradually bring the two scripts closer together, and finally achieve the use of a common standard language.

    苗族和布依族有了本民族的文字
    据新华社贵阳讯　苗族文字初步创制成功。10月31日到11月7日在贵阳举行的苗族语言文字问题科学讨论会，经过热烈讨论后通过了创制三种苗文和改革一种苗文的决议。从此，分布在七个省的、有着两千多年历史的二百五十多万苗族人民，有了本民族的文字。这次会议是中华人民共和国民族事务委员会委托贵州省人民委员会召开的。在会议期间，中国科学院少数民族语言研究所筹备处主任尹育然、苏联语言科学家谢尔久琴柯等就语言科学和创制苗族文字等问题，相继作了全面而精湛的报告，受到全体代表的热烈欢迎。
    又讯　从11月4日到7日在贵阳市举行的布依族语言文字问题科学讨论会通过了“布依族文字方案”（草案）。从此，布依族人民有了本民族的文字。
    布依族人口有一百二十五万，居住在贵州省南部河谷地带和山区，和广西省的僮族地区相连，从事农业生产。根据中国科学院少数民族语言调查第一工作队调查材料证明，布依语和僮语关系密切，属于同一语支。因此，为了便于文化的交流和联系，会议在热烈讨论之后，决定采取布依文和僮文建立文字联盟的方针，布依文在字母形式、拼写规则和语言规范上，尽可能地和僮文取得一致，但也照顾到布依语的特点，以便于布依族人民的学习和使用。
    会议建议贵州省民族语文指导委员会经常和广西省僮族文字研究指导委员会联系，会商有关布依文和僮文共同发展工作中的一些具体问题，促使这两种文字逐渐更加接近，最后达到使用共同的标准语。
