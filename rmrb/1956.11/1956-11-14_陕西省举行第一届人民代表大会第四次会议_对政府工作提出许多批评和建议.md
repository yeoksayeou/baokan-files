Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 12th—The Fourth Session of the First People's Congress of Shaanxi Province was held in Xi'an from November 1st to 8th.

Zhao Boping, Acting Governor of Shaanxi Province, delivered a report at the conference on "Shaanxi Province's 1955 Final Financial Accounts and 1956 Financial Budget." Heads of various departments of Shaanxi Province also spoke at the conference. In addition to reviewing and adopting Shaanxi Province's 1955 Final Financial Accounts and 1956 Financial Budget, the delegates attending the conference also put forward many criticisms and suggestions on the work of various government departments. In addition to expressing their opinions on the government's work in their speeches, the delegates also submitted 219 written opinions to the conference for forwarding to the relevant departments.

The delegates believed that Shaanxi Province had made great achievements in various tasks in the past year, but due to the serious subjectivism and bureaucratic style of the leading departments, there were many shortcomings in various tasks. Many delegates criticized the leading comrades of various government departments for not understanding the situation at the grassroots level, especially for rarely going to mountainous areas such as northern and southern Shaanxi to inspect work. A few people did go down, but not deeply enough. The delegates suggested that leading comrades of various departments should go to counties and townships more often to understand the situation, and participate more in various conferences held by special districts and counties. They should not only contact cadres, but also listen to the opinions of the broad masses of the people.

The delegates pointed out that the government's leading departments also have shortcomings such as insufficient consideration when assigning tasks, failure to take into account the characteristics of various regions, and too many meetings and official documents. In terms of agricultural production, many delegates criticized the provincial leading organs for giving more assignments and less inspection in leading agricultural production; they only cared about assigning tasks and did not care about the results. The delegates believed that technological reform and the promotion of advanced agricultural production experience were of great significance to increasing agricultural production, but attention should be paid to adapting to local conditions when promoting them. In the past, when some places promoted improved varieties, they forcibly promoted them regardless of local soil, climate and other conditions, planting the "Golden Queen" improved corn variety on barren mountain tops, resulting in reduced production and causing dissatisfaction among the masses. When some places distributed agricultural tools, they did not pay enough attention to local characteristics, and many areas that were not suitable for double-wheeled double-furrow plows were allocated a lot, resulting in most of them being idle. The delegates also put forward many opinions on improving the lives of people in mountainous areas. They unanimously believed that the disaster-stricken counties in northern Shaanxi and the impoverished mountainous areas of Daheba in Xixiang, southern Shaanxi, should be given additional relief funds in a timely manner. In order to fundamentally solve the problem of poverty in the lives of people in mountainous areas, the enthusiasm of the people in mountainous areas for production should be brought into play, consideration should be given to relaxing the scope of purchasing local specialties in mountainous areas, and purchasing prices should be appropriately adjusted; the direction of developing sideline production for people in mountainous areas should be pointed out and necessary economic assistance should be provided. The delegates also put forward many criticisms and suggestions on the health and cultural life of people in mountainous areas. Everyone believed that the development of health, cultural, and educational undertakings in mountainous areas in the past was not enough, and attention should be paid to establishing local disease prevention and treatment centers and medical institutions, increasing schools and cultural centers, and organizing more film teams to show movies in mountainous areas.

In addition, the delegates put forward many criticisms and suggestions on the work in various aspects such as finance and economics, industrial transportation, politics and law, and culture, education and health.

At this conference, four vice governors of Shaanxi Province and two members of the Provincial People's Committee were also elected; one delegate to the National People's Congress was also re-elected.

    陕西省举行第一届人民代表大会第四次会议
    对政府工作提出许多批评和建议
    新华社西安12日电　陕西省第一届人民代表大会第四次会议于11月1日至8日在西安举行。
    陕西省代省长赵伯平在大会上作了“关于陕西省1955年财政决算和1956年财政预算”的报告，陕西省各部门负责人也在大会上作了发言。出席大会的代表，除审查和通过了陕西省1955年财政决算和1956年财政预算外，并对政府各部门的工作提出了许多批评和建议。代表们除在发言中对政府工作提出意见外，还把书面意见二百一十九件送交大会转给各有关部门。
    代表们认为陕西省一年来的各项工作取得了很大的成就，但由于领导部门有严重的主观主义和官僚主义作风，因此各项工作存在着不少的缺点。许多代表批评政府各领导部门负责同志了解下面情况不够，尤其是很少到陕北、陕南等山区去检查工作，少数人虽然下去了，但不够深入。代表们建议各领导部门负责同志今后要多下县、乡了解情况，多参加专区、县召开的各种会议，不但要联系干部，更要多听取广大人民群众的意见。
    代表们指出政府的领导部门还存在着布置任务时考虑不够全面、不照顾各地特点，以及会议多、公文多等缺点。在农业生产方面，许多代表批评省的领导机关对农业生产的领导是布置多、检查少；只管布置，不管效果。代表们认为技术改革和推广农业生产先进经验对农业增产有很大意义，但是在推广时应当注意因地制宜。过去有些地方推广良种时，不顾当地土壤、气候等条件而硬性推广，把“金皇后”玉米良种种在贫瘠的山顶上，以致减产，引起群众的不满。有些地方分配农具时，没有很好注意当地特点，很多不适用双轮双铧犁的地区，却分配到不少，结果大部分闲放着。代表们对改善山区人民生活问题也提出许多意见。他们一致认为今年受灾严重的陕北各县和陕南西乡大河坝等地贫困的山区，应及时增拨救济款。为了从根本上解决山区人民生活贫困问题，应该发挥山区人民的生产积极性，考虑放宽山区土特产品收购面，并且适当调整收购价格；应当指出山区人民发展副业生产的方向和在经济上提供必要的援助。代表们对山区人民的卫生和文化生活问题，也提出了许多批评和建议。大家认为过去发展山区的卫生、文化教育事业是作得不够的，今后应注意成立地方病防治所和医疗机构，增设学校和文化馆，多组织电影队到山区放映电影。
    此外，对财经、工业运输、政法、文教卫生等各方面的工作，代表们都提出了许多批评和建议。
    这次大会还增选了陕西省副省长四人，省人民委员会委员两人；补选了全国人民代表大会代表一人。
