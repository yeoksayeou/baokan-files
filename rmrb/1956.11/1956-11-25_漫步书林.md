    On Printing Books

    The so-called specialization refers to the fact that all book "printing" must be "categorized" and "organized," like the "Supplements to the Twenty-Five Histories" or the "Collection of the Masters." Modern readers and experts need things related to their own fields and things they should refer to, not "all-encompassing" "series," "essentials," or "libraries." We imagine: How many specialized books should be reprinted? Aren't books on medicine and hygiene very much needed? Not only for traditional Chinese medicine practitioners, but also for doctors and pharmacists who are learning traditional Chinese medicine and herbal medicine. However, if a word is printed wrong or the dosage of a medicine is misprinted in this type of book, it will cause big problems, even death; therefore, it must be reprinted with the utmost caution, and ancient medical books should be reprinted using the original or the best and most reliable editions. The part of the compilation and printing must be proofread three or five times, until it is perfect. Human life is at stake, not a child's play! Books on agricultural science are also urgently needed today. That important book, "Complete Treatise on Agricultural Administration" (written by Xu Guangqi of the Ming Dynasty), still does not have a new edition today. How rich is our ancient agricultural science knowledge, and it is tailored to the needs of this country and this region; they are the summary of thousands of years of agricultural experience. How can we not collect them and publish them as a "Chinese Agricultural Series," "Chinese Flower and Tree Planting Series," etc.? This is a matter of national economy and people's livelihood. Even departments such as novels, operas, history, and geography urgently need to have sets of large and small series published. Just in terms of history, the annotations and textual research on "Records of the Grand Historian" can be published as a large series. Historical materials from the Song, Yuan, and Ming dynasties are even more numerous and cannot be included in one or two series. Moreover, there are countless unpublished works by scholars of previous generations. Today, we collect them, extend their life for thousands of years, and incarnate them in thousands, so that people in various places and even countries have the opportunity to read them. Isn't this a great event! Like the Song Dynasty manuscript "Hong Fan Zheng Jian," it has been passed down as a single volume for nearly a thousand years. Not only is there no engraved version, but there is also no other transcribed version. This book is one of the "twin mirrors" of Fu Zengxiang's "Twin Mirror Building," and was donated to the government by his descendants. As a reference book for "political science," it is very important. Why not publish it urgently?
    Like this kind of re-"printed" book, the scope should be wide and numerous, and each category and field should form a series, only for the reference of experts, and there is absolutely no need to promote it, it is only research or reference material. For example, ancient operas are re-"printed" into "A Collection of Ancient Chinese Plays," and if they are all published, there will be more than 1,600 kinds. Those are only the opera scripts written in northern and southern tunes. If the scripts of local operas are included, the number will be even greater. Those who are not engaged in the history of Chinese opera, those who are not engaged in "opera reform" or opera creation, what do they need it for? General Chinese literature researchers do not need to read or watch so many operas completely. The supply objects of other large-scale reprinted series are also so limited. This is just changing the copying of one book or the typing or copying and mimeographing of ten or dozens of books to photolithography. Not only can it preserve the truth and save the heavy proofreading power, but it is also more beautiful and cost-saving. One hundred or two hundred copies can be printed, and three thousand or five thousand copies can also be printed, with great flexibility. Therefore, I advocate that all specialized ancient books that are internally referred to and printed in small quantities can be re-"printed" in this way. If it is considered too expensive to re-photograph each page, then for books that are purely for reference, such as "Huang Ming Xian Zheng Lu" and "Huang Ming Jing Shi Wen Bian," the method of the abridged "Si Bu Cong Kan" or the reprinted "Tu Shu Ji Cheng" by Zhonghua Book Company can be used, and every four or six pages can be reduced to one page for printing, which can greatly save effort and materials. However, books that need to be read carefully, such as "Complete Treatise on Agricultural Administration," or books with very fine versions, such as the Ming Hongzhi engraved version of "Romance of the Western Chamber" and the Song Shu engraved version of "Chen Hou Shan Ji," cannot be printed in this way, but should be re-"printed" in the style of "A Collection of Ancient Chinese Plays" or "Si Bu Cong Kan."
    For ancient books that require a relatively large amount and should be reorganized, and even must be newly annotated and explained, such as the "Thirteen Classics" and the "Twenty-Four Histories," we must concentrate some experts to organize specialized editorial committees to carry out the reorganization work separately, so that within a few years or more than ten years, the People's Republic of China version of the "Thirteen Classics" and the "Twenty-Four Histories" with a brand-new look and excellent collation can be published. In this regard, it is a long story, and I plan to write a special article to discuss it, so I won't talk about it here.
    There are also many important ancient books that need one or more new versions. The necessary conditions for the so-called "new version" are: (1) The closest to the original appearance, accurate collation, and striving for no typos. (2) Add paragraphs and punctuation. As early as the Han Dynasty, the study of "chapters and sentences" was very important. (3) Add indexes and other necessary appendices; and a more detailed preface, this preface is indeed from the hand of an expert, not hastily perfunctory. If there are new annotations, then it is a special new work.
    Re-"printed" specialized internal reference materials should be widely and comprehensively collected. Important and necessary general reference books should be proofread and printed carefully, so that readers can easily check them. The main "readers" and other books or the most frequently read literary books should have excellent "new versions." In short, there should be a wide variety of specialized series, with completeness and no omissions as the main goal. The selection of important general ancient books should be precise and strict, with excellent versions as the main goal. Also, the role of "selected works" is the greatest. It is necessary to select ancient poems and prose with a new perspective, which is most beneficial to general readers. The printing of new "selected works" and new "versions" are both urgent tasks today.

    谈印书
    所谓专门化的东西，指的是，凡“印”书一定要成“类”成“门”，像“二十五史补编”或“诸子集成”那样。现代的读者们，专家们，需要的是自己本行的东西和应该参考的东西，而不是“包罗万有”的“丛刊”、“备要”、“文库”之类。我们悬想：应该重印的专门书有多少：医药卫生的书不是很需要么？不仅给中医看，也要给学习中医、中药的医生和药剂师看。但这一类的书，印错了一个字，排错了药品的分量，就会出大毛病，甚至会死人；所以，必须慎之又慎地重印，而且对于古本医书，应该用原著或最好的、最可靠的本子影印。其整理、排印的一部分更必须三校、五校，以至尽善尽美为止。人命关天，岂同儿戏！农业科学的书，也是今日所急需的。那末重要的一部“农政全书”（明徐光启著），今天还没有新版子呢。我们古代的农业科学的知识多么丰富，且是切合于本国、本地的需要的；它们乃是千万年的农事经验的总结。怎能不搜集起来，作为一部乃至若干部的“中国农业丛书”、“中国花木种植丛书”等等，陆续出版呢？这是有关于国计民生的事。乃至小说、戏曲、历史、地理等部门，也都是亟需有一套套的大大小小的丛书出版的。单就历史而言，关于“史记”的注解与考证就可以出一部大丛书。宋代、元代、明代的史料书，更是汗牛充栋，决不是一两部丛书所能包括得了的。其他，前代学者们未刊的著作，更不知有多少。今天把他们搜集起来，为他们延千百年的寿命，且化身千百，各地乃至各国都有机会读到，岂不是盛事！像宋代写本的“洪范政鉴”，孤帙单传，至今将近千年，不仅未有刻本，亦且未有其他传钞本。这书乃是“双鉴楼”傅增湘氏的“双鉴”之一“鉴”，由其后人捐献给政府的。作为一部“政治学”的参考书看，它是很重要的。为什么不急急地付印呢？
    像这一类重“印”书，范围要广、要多，每类每门，各自成一丛书，只供专家们的参考，完全不必要推广，只是研究的或参考的资料而已。如古代的戏曲，重“印”成“古本戏曲丛刊”，如出齐了，就有一千六百多种。那些还只是以南北曲写成的戏本呢，如果包括地方戏的剧本在内数量要更多，更大了。不是搞中国戏曲史的，不是搞“戏改”或搞戏曲创作的人，要它何用。一般的中国文艺研究者不必要完全读或看那末多的戏曲的。其它影印的大部丛书，其供给的对象也是如此的有限度。这只是把一部部地钞写，或者十部或几十部的打字或钞写油印，改为照相石印而已。不仅可以留真，省下繁重的校对力量，且也比较美观、省费，百部、二百部即可以印，三千、五千部也可以印，伸缩性很大。所以我主张，凡小量印行的内部参考资料式的专门性古书，都可以用这种办法重“印”，如果嫌每页照相重印纸张太费，则对于纯粹参考性质的书，像“皇明献徵录”、“皇明经世文编”之类，可以用缩本“四部丛刊”或中华书局重印“图书集成”的办法，每四页或六页缩成一页印出，则大可以省功、省料。不过，要精读的书，像“农政全书”之类，或版本十分精良的书，像明弘治刻本“西厢记”，宋蜀刻本“陈后山集”之类，就不能用这个办法，而应该用“古本戏曲丛刊”或“四部丛刊”的式样重“印”了。
    凡需要量比较大，而且应该加以重新整理，甚至必须加以新注、新解的古书，像“十三经”，“二十四史”之类，则我们得集中些专家们组织专门的编辑委员会，分别进行整理工作，俾能于几年或十几年之内，有面貌全新，校勘精良的中华人民共和国版的“十三经”、“二十四史”出版。在这方面，说来话长，拟写专文论之，这里不多谈了。
    也还有不少重要的古书，需要有一种或一种以上的新版本的。所谓“新版本”，必须具备的条件是：（一）最近于原本的面貌，校勘精确，力求没有错字。（二）加以分段及标点。远在汉代“章句”之学就是很重要的了。（三）附索引及其他必要的附录；还有比较详明的序言，这序言，的确是出于专家的手笔，不是草率敷衍的。如果有新的注解，那末，更是一部专门的新著了。
    重“印”的专门化的内部参考资料，搜罗得要广、要备。重要的必需的一般参考书，校印得要精审，要使读者们检阅便利。主要的“读本”一类的书或最常被阅读的文艺书，更要有精良的“新版本”。总之，专门的丛书要多种多样，以完备不漏为主。重要的一般的古书，选择得要精，要严，以版本精良为主。又，“选本”的作用最大。用新的眼光来选古诗文，是有必要的，对于一般读者们是最有益处的。新的“选本”和新的“版本”的印行，同是今日当务之急。
