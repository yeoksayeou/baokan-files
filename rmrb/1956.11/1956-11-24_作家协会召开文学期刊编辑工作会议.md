Xinhua News Agency report: The China Writers Association convened a conference on literary journal editing starting on the 21st in Beijing. More than 90 editors-in-chief from sixty-four major national literary publications are participating.

    Zhou Yang, Lao She, and Feng Xuefeng, vice-chairmen of the China Writers Association, expressed their opinions on literary journals in their speeches. They hoped that each publication would have a distinct personality and unique style. They requested that literary journals especially respect veteran writers, pay attention to discovering and cultivating new writers, and promote close cooperation between publications and writers. They requested that journal editors be proficient in various art forms, be good at independent thinking, and be good at identifying works, so that people can make the most of their talents and literature can find its proper form. They also pointed out that it is unnecessary for existing literary publications to appear as organs of literary organizations and that it is possible to consider changing this situation.

    In his speech, Lao She expressed dissatisfaction with the current silence in the literary world. He said that it is not a good phenomenon for everyone to be unwilling to speak out. He hopes that literary publications will take the lead in speaking out and encourage everyone to speak out, so that the "hundred schools" can truly contend loudly and the "hundred flowers" can bloom brightly.

    This conference will end at the end of the month. The conference will listen to the opinions of the attendees on the editing work of literary journals and conduct in-depth discussions; it will also stipulate corresponding specific measures to promote the prosperity of literary creation.

    作家协会召开文学期刊编辑工作会议
    新华社讯　全国六十四个主要文学刊物的九十多个负责编辑人员，于21日起在北京参加中国作家协会召开的文学期刊编辑工作会议。
    中国作家协会副主席周扬、老舍、冯雪峰在讲话中发表了他们对文学刊物的意见。他们希望每个刊物都具有鲜明的个性和独特的风格。他们要求文学刊物特别要尊重老作家、注意发现和培养新作家，提倡刊物和作家密切合作。他们要求刊物编辑人员通晓各种文艺形式，善于独立思考、善于鉴别作品，使人尽其才、文得其体。他们并且指出：现有文艺刊物都以文艺团体的机关报刊面目出现是没有必要的，可以考虑改变这种状况。
    老舍在讲话中对当前文坛沉寂的现象表示不满。他说：大家不肯出声不是好现象，他希望文学刊物自己首先出声，并且鼓励大家出声，真正让“百家”鸣得响亮，让“百花”放得光采。
    这一会议将在月底结束。会议要听取出席的人员对文学刊物编辑工作的意见，并且作深入的探讨；还将相应地规定具体措施，以促使文学创作的繁荣。
