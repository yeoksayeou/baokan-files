    Don't Let Young Film Actors Waste Their Youth
    Nangong Ming
    When the Beijing Film Actors Troupe was recruiting new actors, an old actor said that she would never accept this recruitment task because she couldn't bear to see a group of young girls come to this troupe and waste their precious youth in vain.
    An actor's job is to act. In the past two years, the situation of stage actors has improved, and young actors generally have plays to perform. However, the situation for film actors, especially female actors, is still very bad. There are many female actors, including older actors, who have not had the opportunity to act for not one or two years, but four or five years.
    A young actress from Changchun told me that she was very angry after reading an article "A Day in the Life of 'Changying' Actors" published in this year's 20th issue of "Popular Cinema." She said that she didn't understand why the author of this article didn't tell everyone the real situation of the lives of "Changying" actors, but instead adopted this approach of embellishing peace. She does not deny that "Changying" did have poetry recitations and other activities, but this was only occasional, and the results were not good. Many "Changying" actors often have no work and spend their days going around in circles of depression. She used her own daily life as proof: because she didn't know how to spend the long nights, she had to go to bed at eight o'clock. Opening her eyes in bed in the morning, the first thing she thought of was how to pass the day. After breakfast, she reluctantly opened "Actor Self-Cultivation" to read. She didn't even remember how many times she had read this book, and actors can't just read books all the time, they also have to have artistic practice! The more she thought about it, the more upset she felt, and she couldn't read the book, so she had to carry her basket to the cooperative, wander around aimlessly, and buy something delicious to take home. If a few actors met, they would complain, lamenting their misfortune, why they became film actors in this life. In our country's days of vigorously carrying out socialist construction, they felt ashamed because they were well-fed and wandering around all day long.
    The actress who spoke to me has acting talent. In 1950, when she was still studying at the Shanghai Drama School, she was invited by a film studio to shoot a film. Later, she entered film school. At that time, she was only eighteen years old and full of confidence in her future. After graduating from film school, she joined the Beijing Film Actors Troupe, and last year she was assigned to Changchun. Six years have passed, and this year she is already twenty-four years old and has become the mother of a child, but she has not acted in a single play. Speaking of this, she said very painfully: The youngest and most precious period of life has been wasted for six years.
    According to her, the reason why actors have no plays to act in is by no means simply because there are no film scripts. Even if there are film scripts, it is useless if the director does not choose them. And the relationship between directors and actors is not very normal. Directors have many opinions about actors, saying that they have big airs, poor skills, and many opinions; actors believe that directors sometimes do not follow principles when selecting actors. They often like to use actors from other drama theaters and troupes, but do not want actors from the film actors troupe, even though the borrowed actors are not necessarily better than the actors in their own troupe.
    Some people may say that film actors can also stage some dramas if they don't make movies. This opinion is very correct. The film actors troupe has also staged dramas, but this work has not been done well because there is no director. The entire film bureau originally had few directors, and the more experienced directors have filming tasks every year and are very busy. Almost all that remain in the troupe are young assistant directors and assistant directors. Without a director, of course, it is impossible to rehearse plays.
    The actors all know that the film bureau, film studios, troupes, and directors do have many difficulties in this regard, but we can't keep shouting about difficulties. 1956 is coming to an end, and everyone in factories, rural areas, troops, government offices, and schools across the country is busy, warmly welcoming 1957, the final year of our great motherland's first five-year plan. Can these young and promising film actors continue to lie on the moving train all day long doing nothing, letting others pull them through the first five-year plan and into the second five-year plan? Don't let young film actors waste their youth!

### 不要让青年电影演员虚度青春

    不要让青年电影演员虚度青春
    南宫明
    北京电影演员剧团招考新演员时，一位老演员听到这消息后说，她决不接受这个招考任务，原因是她不忍心看着一批年青青的小姑娘到这个剧团来白白地浪费自己宝贵的青春。
    演员的工作是演戏。这两年来，话剧演员的情况有了好转，年青演员一般都有戏演；但是，电影演员，特别是女演员，情况却仍然很坏。有不少女演员，包括老演员在内，不是一年、两年，而是四年、五年没有演戏的机会。
    一位从长春来的年青女演员告诉我，她看了“大众电影”今年第二十期上发表的一篇“‘长影’演员们的一天生活”的报道后非常生气。她说她不明白这篇文章的作者为什么不把“长影”演员们生活的真实情况告诉大家，却采取了这种粉饰太平的作法。她不否认，“长影”的确有过诗歌朗诵等等活动，但是这只是偶一为之，而且成绩也并不佳。“长影”许多演员经常倒是没有工作，成天在苦闷里兜圈子。她以自己一天生活情况来作证明：由于不知道怎样消磨漫长的夜晚，只好八点就上床睡觉。早上在床上睁开眼睛，头一件想到的就是怎样打发这一天的日子。吃过早饭，勉强打开“演员自我修养”来读。自己也不记得这本书是读第几遍了，而且演员不能老读书，也得有艺术实践呀！越想心里越烦，书也读不下去了，于是只好提着篮子到合作社去，漫无目的地逛逛，看见有什么好吃的东西买一点回家。要是有几个演员碰到一起，便发牢骚，自叹命苦，为什么这辈子当了电影演员。在我们祖国这样轰轰烈烈进行社会主义建设的日子里，他们因为自己饱食终日、东游西荡感到羞耻。
    跟我谈话的这位女演员，是有演戏才能的。1950年，她还在上海戏剧专科学校念书时就曾接受电影制片厂的邀请，拍过一部影片。后来她进了电影学校，那时候她才十八岁，对自己前途充满信心。电影学校毕业后进入北京电影演员剧团，去年又给分到长春。整整六年过去了，今年她已经二十四岁，已经成了一个孩子的母亲了，但是，戏却一个也没有演过。谈到这里，她非常痛心地说：生命中最年轻最宝贵的时期已经白白地浪费了六年。
    据她说，演员没戏演，决不单是没有电影剧本的缘故。即使有了电影剧本，导演不选用也是枉然。而导演和演员之间的关系是不大正常的，导演对演员有很多意见，说他们派头大，本事差，意见多；演员们则认为导演选用演员有时候不符合原则，他们常喜欢借用其它话剧院、话剧团的演员，却不要电影演员剧团的演员，虽然借用的演员不一定比自己剧团的演员好。
    有人也许会说，电影演员不拍电影，也可以排些话剧呀。这意见很对。电影演员剧团也排过话剧，但这工作做得并不好，原因是没有导演。整个电影局本来导演就少，比较有经验的导演每年又都有拍片任务，工作很紧张，留在剧团的差不多都是些年轻的副导演和助理导演。没有导演，当然也就无法排戏了。
    演员们都知道，电影局、制片厂、剧团和导演在这方面确实有着许多困难，但是，总不能老喊困难呀。1956年就快完了，全国各个工厂、农村、部队、机关、学校，大家都在忙着，热烈地迎接1957年我们伟大祖国第一个五年计划的最后一年，难道这些年青有为的电影演员们，还能继续这样成天什么也不干地躺在前进的列车上，让别人把他们拉完第一个五年计划，并且进到第二个五年计划去吗？不要让青年电影演员们虚度青春吧！
