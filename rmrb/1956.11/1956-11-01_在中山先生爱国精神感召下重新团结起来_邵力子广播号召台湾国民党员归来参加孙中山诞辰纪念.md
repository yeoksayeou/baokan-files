Xinhua News Agency, October 31st -- Shao Lizi, Secretary-General of the Preparatory Committee for the 90th Anniversary of the Birth of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, delivered a radio address on the Central People's Broadcasting Station tonight, appealing to Kuomintang members in Taiwan to return and participate in the commemoration of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's 90th birthday. The full text of the broadcast is as follows:

Compatriots of the Kuomintang in Taiwan:

The 90th anniversary of the birth of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the great revolutionary leader whom we Chinese compatriots jointly admire, is approaching. Dr. Sun Yat-sen's life was one of revolutionary struggle, one of promoting patriotism, and one of seeking China's freedom and equality, national prosperity and strength, people's well-being, and world harmony. Now, not only are compatriots across the country commemorating Dr. Sun Yat-sen's great achievements and his spirit of patriotism and struggle with fervent hearts, but people from all over the world are also expressing deep respect for this extraordinary and outstanding figure of our country.

The National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference has established the Preparatory Committee for the 90th Anniversary of the Birth of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, and decided to hold grand commemorations in the capital and major cities across the country, inviting friends of Dr. Sun Yat-sen from abroad, foreign guests from Asian, African, European, and American countries, as well as representatives of overseas Chinese, to participate; and also welcomes Kuomintang members in Taiwan to return and hold commemorations together.

I now, on behalf of the Preparatory Committee for the 90th Anniversary of the Birth of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, formally invite you, earnestly hoping that, under the patriotic ideology displayed in Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings, you can return and hold a grand and enthusiastic commemoration with us, especially to hold a grand ceremony of visiting the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum in Nanjing with us.

In order to dispel unnecessary concerns, the Preparatory Committee specially guarantees that we invite you back because we all equally admire Dr. Sun Yat-sen's noble morality, profound thoughts, and immortal achievements. We are all Chinese, and we should unite together in today's free, equal, and prosperous motherland to pay tribute to the revolutionary mentor of a generation. Your coming is free, and your going is even freer. You can travel to Guangzhou via Hong Kong or other places. In Hong Kong, you can contact the China Travel Service (Hong Kong) for travel procedures. After arriving in Guangzhou, you can go to the reception center set up by the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference at 22 Jiefang North Road, Guangzhou, where you will be responsible for the reception. When you come, we will of course welcome you sincerely; when you leave, we will also be responsible for seeing you off.

Here, I tell you:

The Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall in Biyun Temple in the Western Hills of Beijing was renovated five years ago; it has been renovated every year since then, and now it is truly solemn, magnificent, and resplendent. Dr. Sun Yat-sen's deathbed chamber in Tieshizi Hutong is also solemnly furnished as before.

The Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum in Nanjing has been renovated every year. All the aisles, platforms, and stone tops of the mausoleum, as well as the dam and pavilion southeast of the mausoleum, have been renovated. The scenery of the mausoleum is more tranquil, and the flowers and trees in the mausoleum are more beautiful.

Sun Yat-sen's former residence in Shanghai is renovated and painted every year; the living room, dining room, study, and bedroom all maintain their original shapes and styles; the portrait is piled high with flowers offered by visitors.

The Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall in Guangzhou and Dr. Sun Yat-sen's hometown, Cuiheng Village, are also decorated and renovated at any time, displaying various commemorative pictures and relics.

In these places, Chinese and foreign people constantly come to visit and pay their respects. Especially the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum, which has been visited by millions of people in the past seven years. You must also remember it, right? On the eve and the day of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's birthday this year, grand commemorative meetings and visits will be held in these cities respectively; and commemorative films will be screened, and selected works of Sun Yat-sen and commemorative special issues, pictorials, stamps, commemorative medals will be issued, and large-scale exhibitions will be held, etc. You can freely go to these big cities or other places to participate in commemorations and free visits when you return.

I think: You have been staying overseas for a long time, and as the autumn air is crisp, everyone will miss their motherland, relatives, friends, and hometown fields. Wang Wei's famous poem: "Alone, as a stranger in a foreign land, I miss my relatives all the more during festivals; I know my brothers are climbing the heights afar, wearing cornels, yet one is missing." You will have this feeling even more today, right? The 90th anniversary of the birth of our revolutionary mentor Dr. Sun Yat-sen is the biggest festival for Kuomintang members, and also the biggest festival for compatriots across the country. How many times can those who are over forty or fifty years old and have personally listened to Dr. Sun Yat-sen's instructions, and those who have always believed themselves to be Dr. Sun Yat-sen's followers, encounter such a grand and festive festival? Facing this approaching festival will even more arouse the feeling of wanderers missing their relatives, homesickness, and patriotism. Return, return in time to participate in the grand ceremony and talk about old times! The overflowing enthusiasm of the people of the motherland, the beautiful scenery of your hometown fields, the new look of social construction, as well as your white-haired parents leaning on the door, wives, children, brothers, and friends are all waving to you! We should reunite under the inspiration of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's great patriotic spirit.

    在中山先生爱国精神感召下重新团结起来
    邵力子广播号召台湾国民党员归来参加孙中山诞辰纪念
    新华社31日讯　孙中山先生诞辰九十周年纪念筹备委员会秘书长邵力子今晚在中央人民广播电台发表广播演说，号召台湾国民党员归来参加孙中山先生九十周年诞辰纪念。广播全文如下：
    台湾的国民党员们：
    我们中国同胞共同敬仰的，一代伟大革命领袖孙中山先生的九十周年诞辰就要到来了。孙中山先生的一生，是革命奋斗的一生，是宣扬爱国的一生，是求中国之自由平等、国家富强、人民康乐、世界大同的一生。现在不但全国同胞正以热烈的心情，来追怀感念孙中山先生的丰功伟绩，和他的爱国奋斗精神；就是世界各国人士也都对我国的这位非凡杰出的人物，表示深切的崇敬。
    中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会已经组成了孙中山先生诞辰九十周年纪念筹备委员会，决定在首都和全国各大城市举行隆重的纪念，邀请国外孙中山先生生前的友好，和亚非欧美国家的外宾，以及海外华侨的代表们都来参加；并且欢迎在台湾的国民党员回来一道举行纪念。
    我现在代表孙中山先生诞辰九十周年纪念筹备委员会，正式向你们约请，热望你们在感怀孙中山先生遗教所垂示的爱国思想下，能够回来同我们一道举行隆重热烈的纪念大会，尤其是同我们一道举行参谒南京中山陵的隆重仪式。
    为了消除不必要的顾虑，纪念筹备委员会特别提出保证，我们请你们回来，是因为我们都同样崇仰孙中山先生的崇高道德、渊博思想和不朽功业，我们同是中国人，应当同在今天获得自由平等的强盛祖国，一齐团结起来，告慰于一代的革命导师。你们来既自由，去更自由。你们可以假道香港或其他各地直到广州，在香港可到香港中国旅行社接洽旅行手续，到广州后可到广州解放北路二十二号中国人民政治协商会议广东省委员会所设的招待处，那里负责招待。你们来的时候，我们当然竭诚相迎；走的时候，也要负责相送。
    这里，我告诉你们：
    北京西山碧云寺的孙中山纪念堂，早在五年前重加修缮；以后年年刷新，现在真是庄严壮丽，金碧辉煌。铁狮子胡同中山先生的临终寝室，也是照旧庄严地陈设着。
    南京中山陵墓年年修缮，所有甬道、平台、灵寝石顶，陵东南的水坝水榭都早已修整一新；陵园的景色更加幽静，陵园的花木更加美丽。
    上海的中山故居，年年整修和粉刷；客厅、餐厅、书室、寝室都保持着原来的形状和风格；遗像前堆满着瞻仰人们所献的鲜花。
    广州的中山纪念堂和中山故乡的翠亨村同样随时布置，随时整修，陈列着各种各样的纪念图片和遗物。
    在这些地方，经常不断地有中外人士前来参谒和瞻仰。尤其是中山陵墓，七年来到此瞻仰的，已有几百万人次。想必你们也念念不忘吧。今年中山先生诞辰前夕和当天，更要分别在这些城市举行隆重的纪念大会和参谒仪式；并且放映纪念电影，发行孙中山选集和纪念专册、画刊、邮票、纪念章以及举办大规模的展览会等等各种各样的活动。你们回来，可以自由到这些大城市或者其他各地，自由参加纪念和自由参谒。
    我想：你们勾留海外，岁月稽迟，当此秋高气爽，是谁都要怀念祖国亲友、故乡田园的。王摩诘的有名诗句：“独在异乡为异客，每逢佳节倍思亲；遥知兄弟登高处，遍插茱萸少一人。”你们今天也更会有这种心情吧。我们革命导师孙中山先生九十周年的诞辰，是国民党人最大的佳节，也是全国同胞最大的佳节。这一代四五十岁以上曾经亲聆中山先生训示的，和一向自信是中山先生信徒的人们，能逢几次这样隆重盛大的佳节呢？面临即将到来的这个佳节，是更会引起游子思亲，怀乡怀国之感的。归来吧，及时归来参加盛典，一叙契阔吧！祖国人民的洋溢热情，故乡田园的秀丽景色，社会建设的崭新面貌，以及你们白发倚闾的双亲，望穿秋水的妻室儿女、兄弟朋友们都在向你们招手！我们应当在中山先生伟大爱国精神的感召下重新团结起来。
