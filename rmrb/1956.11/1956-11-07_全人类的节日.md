    A Festival for All Mankind
    Cao Yu
    Thirty-nine years ago today, the first great socialist country appeared on Earth. From that time on, the Chinese people drew infinite strength and inspiration from the great Soviet Union. Every Chinese person has come to realize a truth from their own personal experience: the Soviet Union has always been the most loyal, sincere, and truly capable friend to people around the world, helping them to achieve independence and freedom. The Chinese people have never forgotten the October Revolution Day, and have never forgotten that human history truly turned a new page because of the October Revolution.
    No matter when, no matter under what circumstances, we believe that the great Communist Party of the Soviet Union, with its lofty ideals, wisdom, and candor, shines like a giant lighthouse, not only illuminating the entire Soviet Union, but also illuminating the entire world. Who can forget the selfless support and help received from the giant hand of the Soviet Union during the dark moments of being plundered, oppressed, and exploited by imperialism, during times of hardship, hunger, and cold? We often say: "A friend in need is a friend indeed." The great Soviet Union is a true friend to all oppressed people in the world. It has never forgotten that there are countless suffering brothers and sisters in every corner of the world who also yearn for happiness and light, just because it has embarked on the broad road of socialist construction.
    It must be recognized that the October Revolution is the source of strength for all progressive humanity, and the October Revolution Day is a common festival for socialists all over the world. Especially today, when international reactionary forces have torn off their hypocritical masks and openly threaten human peace and happiness with violence and war, we feel even more fortunate, because the guns of the October Revolution brought the Soviet Union, which gave faith and light to those who yearn for peace and oppose exploitation today. We are communist fighters, and we are also friends of all progressive causes of mankind. All progressive people who uphold democracy and freedom know this fact: the peace of the world and the development of civilization are strongly guaranteed because of the existence of socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union.
    Not many days after the recent Hungarian incident, the people of the world have seen very clearly that counter-revolutionary forces took advantage of the shortcomings of the past Hungarian government and infiltrated the masses to carry out a counter-revolutionary restoration conspiracy. However, in the midst of extreme chaos, the Hungarian people finally successfully organized a new workers' and peasants' revolutionary government, and with the strong assistance of the great Soviet people and army, smashed the counter-revolutionary restoration forces. The Hungarian incident once again proved the significant role played by the Soviet Union in the common just cause of socialist countries. Isn't this a clear fact? When the future of the Hungarian working people was in dire straits, wasn't it the Soviet people and army who supported the Hungarian brothers in deep water and scorching fire with their enthusiasm and blood, saving them from becoming slaves of fascism?
    "The socialist cause is a new cause in human history. All new causes are bound to make mistakes of one kind or another due to lack of experience." In the socialist family headed by the Soviet Union, precisely because of the lack of experience in some aspects, there are sometimes unsatisfactory things in the mutual relations between socialist countries. However, if such shortcomings are compared with the selfless assistance and encouragement in all aspects received from this great country, it can be clearly seen that these shortcomings are secondary and cannot be mentioned in the same breath, and the sincere selflessness and internationalist friendship we have received from the Soviet Union cannot be seen in the relations between countries in any era of history. The greatness of a person is not because he has a huge hand and body, but because in his heart, there beats a great, passionate, sincere, and frank heart. The greatness of the Soviet Union is also like this.
    The 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union has made important resolutions on the common cause of socialist fraternal countries. A week ago, on October 30, the Soviet government issued a historically significant declaration on the development and strengthening of friendship and cooperation between the Soviet Union and other socialist countries. This is a declaration full of frankness, sincerity, persuasiveness, and constructiveness. This declaration has won the heartfelt praise of socialist countries, and has also won the support of all people who love justice and peace. When dark clouds cover the sun, the dark clouds have never weakened the sun's light and heat in the slightest, but when the sun finally overcomes the dark clouds and reveals its dazzling brilliance again, everyone's face cannot help but show heartfelt joy. As time advances, mankind gains richer knowledge, and a brave and great country gains deeper experience and wisdom as time advances. The power emanating from that new experience and wisdom will be unshakable by all imperialist conspiracies and violence, and will be indestructible by the atomic power relied upon by all warmongers. Today, on the thirty-ninth anniversary of the October Revolution, when the revolutionary forces in Hungary, relying on the fraternal help of the Soviet Union, have shattered the conspiracy of counter-revolutionary restoration, when the great Soviet Union's declaration of October 30 is playing a powerful role, we and all peace-loving people in the world more clearly recognize this indelible truth: Socialist countries must unite more closely and firmly, not only for our present, but also for our future generations.
    On the morning of October 1st—China's National Day—my child received a congratulatory letter from a student at a middle school in the Soviet Union. The letter said: "Your holiday is our holiday." The words of this Soviet child spread throughout my child's school like a song of spring. A few days before the October Revolution Day, my child excitedly showed me a congratulatory letter they wrote to Soviet children, which said: "Your holiday is a holiday for all mankind."
    This sentence will not only be transmitted to the Soviet Union, but will also resonate in every corner of the world and in the hearts of everyone, like joyful chimes, with echoes that are louder and louder.

    全人类的节日
    曹禺
    三十九年前的今天，地球上出现了第一个伟大的社会主义国家。从那时起，中国人民便从伟大的苏联吸取了无限的力量和鼓舞。每个中国人从自己切身的经验体会出来一个真理，那就是：苏联一直是全世界人民最忠心、最诚恳、真正能够帮助人们得到独立和自由的朋友。中国人民从来没有忘记过十月革命节，从未忘记由于有了十月革命，人类的历史才真正翻开了新的一页。
    无论在什么时候，无论在什么情况下，我们相信伟大的苏联共产党以它的崇高的理想、智慧和坦白真挚，像一个巨大的灯塔，不只照耀着整个的苏联，并且照耀着整个的世界。哪一个人能够忘记在受尽了帝国主义的掠夺、压迫和剥削的黑暗时刻，在苦难重重、饥寒交迫的时刻、从苏联巨大的手掌里所得到的无私的支援和帮助？我们常说：“患难之交才是真正的朋友。”伟大的苏联就是全世界一切被压迫人民的患难朋友。它从来没有因为自己走上了社会主义建设的康庄大道，便忘记世界各个角落里还有无数的受苦受难的弟兄们同样渴望着幸福和光明。
    必须认识，十月革命是全世界进步人类力量的源泉，十月革命节是全世界的社会主义者的共同的节日。尤其是在今天，当国际的反动势力拉下它伪善的嘴脸，公然用暴力和战争威胁人类的和平和幸福的时候，我们就更感觉到庆幸，因为十月革命的炮声带来了苏联，它给了今天渴望和平和反对剥削的人们以信念和光明。我们是共产主义的战士，我们也是人类一切进步事业的朋友。凡是拥护民主、自由的进步人士都知道这个事实：世界的和平和文明的发展，是因为有了以苏联为首的社会主义各国的困难，才得到有力的保障。
    最近匈牙利事件发生不几天，世界人民已经看得很清楚，是反革命势力利用了过去匈牙利政府的缺点，混入人民群众内部，进行反革命复辟的阴谋。然而在极度的混乱中，匈牙利人民终于组织成功新的工农革命政府，在伟大苏联人民和军队的坚强援助下，粉碎了反革命复辟势力。匈牙利事件再一次证明苏联在社会主义各国共同的正义事业中所起的重大作用。难道这不是鲜明的事实吗？当匈牙利劳动人民的前途危在旦夕的时候，不就是苏联人民和军队以他们的热情和鲜血，支援了在水深火热中的匈牙利弟兄，使他们免于沦为法西斯主义的奴隶吗？
    “社会主义事业是人类历史上的新事业。一切新事业都不免由于缺乏经验而发生这样那样的错误。”在以苏联为首的社会主义大家庭中，正是由于缺乏某些方面的经验，有些时候在社会主义国家的相互关系上，不免发生令人不能满足的地方。但这样的缺点如果和从这种伟大的国家所得到的无私援助和各方面的鼓舞相比的话，那么很清楚地可以看出，这些缺点是次要的，不能相提并论的，而我们从苏联所得到的真诚无私，国际主义的友谊，是在历史上任何时代国家与国家的关系上所见不着的。一个人的伟大不是因为他具有一付巨大的手和身体，而是因为在他的胸怀里，跳动着一颗伟大的、热情的、真诚的、坦白的心。苏联的伟大也正是这样。
    苏联共产党第二十次代表大会已经就社会主义各兄弟国家的共同事业上，作了有重要意义的决议。一个星期以前，10月30日，苏联政府又就发展、加强苏联和其他社会主义国家的友谊和合作的问题上，发表了富有历史意义的宣言。这是一个充满了坦率、诚恳，富有说服力和建设性的宣言。这个宣言赢得了社会主义国家的衷心赞美，也赢得了一切爱正义爱和平的人们的拥护。当乌云遮住了太阳的时候，乌云何曾减弱了太阳一丝一毫的光和热，但当太阳终于战胜了乌云，重又露出它耀眼的光辉的时候，一切人的脸上都禁不住浮起衷心的欢喜。随着时间的前进，人类获得了更丰富的知识，一个勇敢的伟大的国家随着时间的前进，也就获得了更深刻的经验和智慧。从那新的经验和智慧所发出的力量，将是一切帝国主义者的阴谋暴力所不能撼动的，将是一切战争贩子们所恃的原子武力所不能破坏的。今天，在十月革命节三十九周年的时候，在匈牙利的革命力量依靠着苏联弟兄般的帮助，粉碎了反革命复辟的阴谋的时候，在伟大的苏联10月30日的宣言发生着强有力的作用的时候，我们和全世界一切爱好和平的人民，都更清楚地认识了这个不可磨灭的真理：社会主义国家必须更亲密地，更坚固地团结起来，不只为了我们的今天，也为了我们的后一代。
    在10月1日—中国国庆节的早晨，我的孩子从苏联一个中学的学生那里得到一封贺信。信里说：“你们的节日就是我们的节日。”这个苏联小朋友的话像春天的歌唱，传遍了我的孩子的学校。在十月革命节的前几天，我的孩子兴高采烈地把她们写给苏联小朋友的一封贺信给我看，里面说：“你们的节日是全人类的节日。”
    这句话将不只传到苏联，并且将在全世界各个角落里和每个人的心坎上，像欢乐的钟声，永不间断地引起一声比一声更响亮的共鸣。
