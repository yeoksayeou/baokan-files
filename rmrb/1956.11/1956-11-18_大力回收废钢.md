Xinhua News Agency, 17th. Ten state-owned factories in Beijing recycled more than 25,300 tons of scrap steel in the first ten months of this year; some of it has been handed over according to the state plan.

After recycling more than 9,800 tons of scrap steel, the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant has formulated a plan to recycle another 2,500 tons of scrap steel in the last two months of this year. The Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory overfulfilled its scrap steel recycling plan in September, and strives to recycle another 580 tons or more before the end of this year. In addition to overfulfilling the plan for recycling scrap steel, the Beijing No. 1 Machine Tool Plant also recycled more than 7,600 kilograms of scrap copper.
