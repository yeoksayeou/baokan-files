	The Watch
	Luo Wenxin
	I remember when I was a child, my father would stroke his beard and tell me about Shanghai. He told me how big the city was—so big that even adults could get lost; he told me how many pickpockets there were in Shanghai, and how easy it was to be taken advantage of when buying things or doing anything else. Later, as I grew up, I began to hear people say things like: Shanghai, a city of sin…

	After liberation, I stayed in the remote frontier, and in the midst of a busy life, I would often think of Shanghai, thinking that it had become a city of the people and must have changed a lot. But what exactly had it become? Although the newspapers had reported on it, I still hoped that one day I could go to Shanghai and have fun myself.

	Unexpectedly, this time the leadership approved my leave to go back and see my hometown and my mother after seven years of separation, and I could also pass through Shanghai.

	On the day I arrived in Shanghai, after resting, I went out to play, almost greedily, hoping to see everything. The next day, because I was leaving Shanghai soon, I went to People's Park early in the morning, wanting to take a few photos as a souvenir, but this plan was thwarted by a sudden rain, so I had to take a pedicab back to the Pacific Hotel on Guangxi North Road.

	Despite this, I was still happy in my heart. Although I only stayed in Shanghai for a little over a day, I finally saw Shanghai with my own eyes, saw the Shanghai of the people; saw that the racecourse where those foreigners used to enjoy themselves had become People's Park, and that the concessions where foreigners used to flaunt their power had become the location of people's organizations and enterprises. I saw the excellent order that the imperialists had determined we could not achieve.

	However, at this moment, an accident happened: I realized that the watch in my pocket was lost!

	What a good watch! Beautiful in appearance and accurate, I bought it only last autumn. I felt extremely anxious and uncomfortable. Braving the heavy rain, I returned to People's Park and searched everywhere, but there wasn't even a shadow of it.

	"Maybe I lost it on the street..." I thought, then there's no hope!

	With heavy steps, I returned to the hotel. All day long, my heart felt heavy.

	At 5 p.m., I boarded the "Jianghan" steamer bound for Wuhan, still thinking about the watch and the unpleasant incident.

	The weather was sultry. I asked someone for the time. There was still half an hour before the ship left, so I disembarked to buy an ice cream. I strolled lazily along the Bund. At this moment, a tram sped past me. It seemed that someone in the carriage was calling out to me. What happened? —I thought, and slowed down my pace.

	After a while, three people hurried towards me.

	"Comrade, did you lose something?"

	"Ah! I lost it! A watch—without a strap!" I looked at them in surprise.

	"We've brought it back for you!"

	"Ah..." I took the watch and, upon closer inspection, it was indeed mine. I couldn't help but look at them again. I remembered—the dark-skinned middle-aged man was the pedicab driver who took me back to the hotel, and the other two were young service workers from the Pacific Hotel, Gu Yongmao and Yu Yaoqian. At this moment, everything became clear. It turned out that the watch was lost in the pedicab. When the pedicab driver realized it, it had been a long time, and he couldn't figure out which passenger had lost it. So he stopped working and went door to door along the route he had taken, looking for the passenger who had lost the watch. Later, he found the Pacific Hotel and asked all the guests, but no one had lost a watch. The comrades at the hotel guessed it was mine and, knowing that I had already boarded the ship, were afraid he wouldn't find me, so they came together.

	I was stunned, staring at their faces covered in sweat, and tightly grasped their hands. I didn't know what to say, just repeating, "Thank you! Thank you!"

    记得在童年的时候，爸爸就曾捋着胡子给我讲述过上海的情况。讲述过这城市有多么大——大到连大人都会丢失；讲述过上海的扒手有多么多，买东西或者干别的什么时，有多么容易吃亏。后来长大了，我也就开始听到一种这样的说法：上海，一个罪恶的城市………
    解放后，我一直呆在遥远的边疆，在紧张的生活里，还常常会想起上海来，想起它已经成了人民的城市，一定早已大变样了。但是究竟变成什么样子了呢？报纸上虽然报道过，但我还是期望着能有那么一天，亲自去上海玩玩。
    想不到，这次上级准了我的假，回去看看离别七年的故乡和妈妈，而且能经过上海。
    到上海那天，歇下脚，便出去玩，几乎是贪婪地玩着，希望能看到一切。第二天，因为马上要离开上海，一早便到了人民公园，想拍几张照片留个纪念，但是这个打算却因为一阵骤雨而未能实现，只好乘三轮车回到广西北路太平洋旅社。
    尽管如此，我心里也还是愉快的，虽然来上海只有一天多，但是，我总算亲自看到了上海，看到了人民的上海；看到了那曾经是那些洋人享乐的跑马厅成了人民公园，那曾经是洋人耀武扬威的租界成了人民的机关和企业的所在地。看到了那曾经为帝国主义断定我们办不到的优良的秩序。
    然而，就在这时候，却发生了一件意外的事：我发觉我放在裤兜里的表丢了！
    多好的一只表啊！外表美观，走的又准，去年秋天才买的。心里不知道有多么焦急和难受。冒着大雨，我又回到人民公园，四处寻找，可是，连影儿也没有。
    “也许丢在街上了………”我想，那就再也没有希望了！
    迈着沉重的步子，回到旅社，整整一天，心里都是沉甸甸的。
    下午五时，我登上了开往武汉的“江汉轮”，还在想着那只手表，想着那不愉快的事。
    天气闷热，向别人问了问时间，离开船还有半个钟头，便下船来买冰棍吃。沿着外滩，懒洋洋地走着。这时，一辆电车从我身旁疾驶而过。似乎车厢有人向我呼喊。发生了什么事情呢？——我想着，便放慢了步子。
    一会儿，三个人匆忙地向我跑来。
    “同志，你掉了东西吗？”
    “啊！丢了！一只手表——没安表带的！”我惊讶地望着他们。
    “我们给你送来啦！”
    “啊……”接过手表，一看，正是我的那只。我不禁再次打量他们，想起来了——那个皮肤黝黑的中年人，是送我回旅社的三轮车工人，另外两个是太平洋旅社的青年服务员顾永茂和俞耀乾。这时，一切都明白了。原来表丢在三轮车上了，当三轮车工人发觉时，已经过了很久，弄不清是哪个乘客丢的了。他便歇下工作，沿着自己走过的地方，挨户去寻找丢表的乘客，后来找到太平洋旅社，遍问旅客，谁也没有丢表，旅社的同志猜想是我的，知道我已经上了船，怕他找不着，便一道赶来了。
    我楞住了，一直望着他们淌满了汗水的脸孔，紧紧地握住他们的手。我不知道说什么好，只是重复着：“谢谢！谢谢你们！”
