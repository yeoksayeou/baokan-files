Xinhua News Agency, 2nd November dispatch from London: The British House of Lords held a meeting on the afternoon of November 1st to discuss the government's issue of sending troops to invade Egypt.

    Labour Party member Henderson said that the British government violated the obligations it should have undertaken under the United Nations Charter. He said that the Anglo-French intervention was an illegal action, which could not be defended by any international treaty.

    Parliamentarians Ray and Samuel announced, on behalf of the Labour Party, their opposition to the government's position. Parliamentarian Samuel particularly pointed out that the Suez Canal was not in danger, and the British people did not intend to participate in a war that might drag on. He concluded by saying, "If our government insists on doing so, then the reaction of the national social figures will have serious consequences for the government."

    The Archbishop of Canterbury also said that the British government had violated the spirit of the United Nations Charter. He said that the most important thing now is for Britain and France to withdraw their troops from Egyptian territory.

    Conservative Party members spoke in support of the government. However, some of them also expressed concern that the government's actions might bring adverse consequences to Britain, damage Britain's international prestige, and create rifts in the "friendship" of the Commonwealth countries.

    Home, on behalf of the government, replied to the parliamentarians who spoke in the debate, repeating the excuses used by British ministers, saying that it was "necessary to stop the war between Israel and Egypt."

    After the British House of Lords concluded the debate on the government's Middle East policy, it voted on the motion proposed by the Labour opposition to condemn the use of force against Egypt. As a result of the vote, thirty votes were in favor of the motion, and eighty-two votes were against it.

    英上院讨论出兵侵略埃及问题
    工党议员提议谴责政府黩武
    新华社2日讯　据塔斯社伦敦讯：英国上院11月1日下午举行会议，讨论政府出兵侵略埃及问题。
    工党议员汉德逊说，英国政府违反了根据联合国宪章应当承担的义务。他说，英法干涉是非法行动，这种行动是用任何一个国际条约都不能为它辩护的。
    议员雷和议员塞缪尔代表工党宣布了反对政府的立场。议员塞缪尔特别指出，苏伊士运河并没有遭到危险，英国人民也不打算参加可能拖延下去的战争。他最后说，“如果我国政府坚持这样做，那末，全国社会人士的反应对政府来说将有严重的后果。”
    坎特伯雷教长也说，英国政府破坏了联合国宪章的精神。他说，现在首要的是英法把自己的军队撤出埃及领土。
    保守党议员发言支持政府。可是他们当中也有一些议员表示担心政府的行动可能给英国带来不利的后果，会损害英国的国际威信，并且会使英联邦国家的“友谊”发生裂痕。
    霍姆代表政府对辩论中发言的议员作答复，他重复英国的大臣们沿用的借口，说什么“必须制止以色列和埃及的战争。”
    英国上院在结束关于政府对中东政策问题的辩论后，表决工党反对派提出的谴责对埃及使用武力的提案。表决结果，有三十票赞成这个提案，有八十二票反对。
