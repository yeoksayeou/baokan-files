Enable the Masses to Wear Winter Clothes in Time
	Sewing Cooperatives in Various Parts of Yunnan Shorten the Time for Picking Up Clothes
(Our newspaper's Kunming dispatch, November 23rd) Garment sewing production cooperatives in Yuxi, Lijiang, Dali, Chuxiong and other regions, as well as Kunming City, have taken measures to shorten the time for sewing clothes. The Tonghai Sewing Cooperative in Yuxi Prefecture has absorbed auxiliary family labor of cooperative members to do odd jobs in the cooperative. Those with higher skills replaced cooperative members in operating the machines, so that "people can rest, but the machines don't stop." They also reduced meeting time and increased working hours, concentrating on piecework. Now, the time for picking up clothes at this cooperative has been shortened from more than a month to seven or eight days. Lijiang County arranged for more than two hundred auxiliary laborers and residents to do odd jobs in sewing cooperatives, such as buttoning, sewing patterns, and running lines, so that cooperative members can concentrate on cutting and operating the machines. They also ran a sewing short-term training class for thirty people. The fifteen trainees trained in the Yongping County Sewing Short-term Training Class in Dali Prefecture have formed three mobile groups to sew winter clothes for farmers in various districts. This prefecture also transferred sewing workers who had previously changed jobs from agricultural cooperatives in Dali and other counties to counties with insufficient sewing manpower. In Chuxiong Prefecture, it was proposed to implement an excess-reward wage system in sewing cooperatives. The Chuxiong County Sewing Cooperative abolished the method of accepting orders every seven days and took in 302 sets of clothes in two days. It is estimated that these jobs can be completed in less than a week. Various sewing and garment production cooperatives in Kunming City have also adjusted their labor organization, allowing technical personnel from the management departments to participate in production. Many processing plants have also organized shock brigades on a voluntary basis, using Sundays or evening rest time to rush-sew backlog clothes, so that customers can wear winter clothes in time. As a result of these measures, not only has the sewing time been shortened, but the income of cooperative members has also increased, and the processing quality has also been guaranteed. Some sewing cooperative members in Yuxi have increased their wage income by nearly one-third.

    让群众及时穿上冬装
    云南各地缝纫社缩短了取衣时间
    本报昆明23日电　云南玉溪、丽江、大理、楚雄等专区以及昆明市的服装缝纫生产社，采取措施缩短了缝衣时间。玉溪专区的通海缝纫社吸收社员家庭辅助劳动力到社里做杂活，技术较高的就接替社员打机子，使“人停机不停”，并且减少会议时间增加工时，集中力量干零活。现在这个社的取衣时间已经由一个多月缩短到七、八天。丽江县安排了二百多个辅助劳动力和居民到缝纫社做锁纽、铺花、行线等杂活，让社员们尽量剪裁和打机子；并办了三十人的缝纫短期训练班。大理专区永平县缝纫短期训练班训练出来的十五名学员，已经组成三个流动组到各区替农民缝冬衣。这个专区并从大理等县农业社中将过去转业的缝纫工人抽出来，调到缝纫力量不足的县去。在楚雄专区，提出了在缝纫社里推行超额奖励的工资制度。楚雄县缝纫社取消了七天一接件的办法，两天中就接进三百零二套衣服，这些活计估计不到一星期就能赶完。昆明市各缝纫、服装生产社也调整了劳动组织，让管理部门的技术人员参加生产。许多加工厂还按自愿原则组织了突击队，利用星期日或晚上的休息时间突击缝制积压的衣服，使顾客能及时穿上冬衣。采取这些措施的结果，不仅使缝衣时间缩短了，社员收入也增加了，加工质量也有保证。玉溪有的缝纫社社员增加工资收入近三分之一。
