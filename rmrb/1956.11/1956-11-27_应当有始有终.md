    Should Have a Beginning and an End
  　Hao Jie
    Some key projects do not pay enough attention to the finishing work, which seriously affects the quality of the project and delays the completion time. This is a problem that deserves attention.
    The First Automobile Factory project had such a lesson at the end of the project. When only 3.4% of the project remained, the directly subordinate engineering company of the Construction Engineering Department was eager to transfer the construction force to other projects, and requested that the remaining finishing work be handed over to the client. At that time, the client agreed because they did not understand the situation and lacked careful consideration. Moreover, the two parties did not ask for approval from higher authorities and signed an agreement on their own.
    According to the agreement, the directly subordinate engineering company justifiably handed over the finishing work to the First Automobile Factory. Unexpectedly, the First Automobile Factory did not have enough construction technical force to undertake the finishing work. For example, materials could not be supplied, and the machinery and tools were incomplete. As a result, these finishing works were delayed again and again. When the rainy season came, it often rained heavily outside and lightly inside. Because the floor was not leveled, the water could not flow out, and the basement became a swimming pool for frogs. Because the ventilation equipment was not properly done, workers had to work in front of furnaces with temperatures of 1200 to 1300 degrees.
    In order to complete the finishing work as soon as possible, in addition to being busy with production preparations, the First Automobile Factory also had to take care of several construction units that were not subordinate to each other, which caused confusion in the work and unexpected expenses, such as worker relocation fees, machinery and tool transportation fees, downtime fees due to insufficient material supply, and maintenance fees after the machinery and tools rusted, and so on.
    From the lessons of the First Automobile Factory, as a contracting department, it should be responsible for the projects it is responsible for building, from beginning to end. Although when the project is nearing completion, in order to avoid wasting labor, some construction forces can be transferred, but this transfer must be carried out on the condition that the finishing work is completed on schedule or ahead of schedule. It is absolutely not allowed to only make small calculations for one's own unit, intentionally let others "clean up the mess," and cause losses to the country. As a construction department, it should also adopt an attitude of being responsible to the country, urge the contracting unit to complete the project on schedule, ensure the quality of the project, and assist the country in carefully accepting it.
    Now it is already the fourth quarter. Of the more than 600 factories and mining projects above the quota in the country, about 40 will be completed in this quarter, and a large number of finishing works will be carried out in winter construction. Therefore, both parties must work together to ensure the progress and quality of the finishing work.

    应当有始有终
  　郝洁
    有些重点工程对于收尾工程不够重视，严重影响了工程质量，拖延了交工时间，这是一个值得引起注意的问题。
    第一汽车厂工程结束时就曾经有过这样的教训。当工程还剩下3.4％的时候，建筑工程部直属工程公司急于把施工力量转移到其他工程上去，就要求把剩下的结尾工程移交给甲方。当时，甲方由于不了解情况，缺乏慎重考虑，就答应了下来。并且，双方也没有请示上级批准，就自行签订了协议。
    按协议规定，直属工程公司就明正言顺地把结尾工程移交给了第一汽车厂。不料，第一汽车厂并没有足够的施工技术力量来承担结尾工程，例如材料供应不上，机具又不全，结果这些尾巴工程一拖再拖。雨季来了，常常是室外下大雨，室内下小雨。由于地坪没有平完，水流不出去，地下室变成了青蛙的游泳池。由于通风设备没有搞好，工人们不得不在一千二、三百度的高温炉子前面工作。
    为了赶紧把结尾工程做完，第一汽车厂除了忙于生产准备以外，又要照顾互不隶属的几个施工单位，造成了工作上的混乱和意外的开支，如工人迁移费、机具运输费、材料供应不上的窝工费和机具生锈以后的维修费等等。
    从第一汽车厂的教训看来，作为承建部门，对于自己负责修建的工程应该负责到底，有始有终。虽然当工程接近结束时，为了不窝工，可以调走一部分施工力量，但是这种调动必须在保证如期或提前完成收尾工程的条件下进行，绝不能只为本单位打小算盘，存心让别人给“擦屁股”，使国家遭受损失。作为建筑部门也应该抱着对国家负责的态度，督促承建单位如期交工，并保证工程质量，协助国家认真验收。
    现在已经是第四季度了。全国六百多个限额以上的工厂和矿山工程，大约有四十多项要在这个季度完工，而且大量的收尾工程要进行冬季施工，因此甲乙双方必须共同努力，保证收尾工程的进度和质量。
