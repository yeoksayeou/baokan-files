New Products and New Technologies

    Plasticized Cement
    The Nanjing Public-Private Joint Jiangnan Cement Plant recently successfully trial-produced a new type of cement: plasticized cement. Physical tests have proven that the cement's plasticity, strength, and stability all meet standards.
    This plasticized cement was trial-produced based on advanced Soviet technology and experience. It is made by adding a plasticizing agent made from waste liquid from paper pulping (water hyacinth slurry) to ordinary cement clinker and finely grinding the mixture. When using this cement to prepare concrete, the amount used can be reduced by 6% to 8% compared to ordinary cement. The strength, frost resistance, and impermeability of the concrete are also better than concrete prepared with ordinary cement. This cement can be widely used in general construction projects.

    Wooden Mast Crane
    A wooden mast crane has proven to be effective after being used for three weeks at a construction site in Hohhot.
    This crane can lift various precast reinforced concrete components weighing from half a ton to about one ton to a height of over sixteen meters. It can move back and forth on small iron rails under the base, and the lifting arm can move left and right, placing the lifted object in the appropriate place. Except for the screws connecting the various parts and the six iron wheels under the base, the rest of this crane is made of wood, costing only 800 yuan. This wooden crane was created by Tong Yeke, a work area director from the Second Engineering Company directly under the Inner Mongolia Urban Construction Bureau, who started as a worker.

    New Printing and Dyeing Methods
    Three public-private joint printing and dyeing factories in Shanghai have recently successfully tested three new printing and dyeing technologies.
    Two new printing methods successfully tested by the public-private joint Tianyi Printing and Dyeing Factory and Hengfeng Printing and Dyeing Factory can print multi-colored fabrics with fewer printing rollers. Tianyi Printing and Dyeing Factory learned from Soviet experience by applying a dyeing aid to one printing roller, causing the patterns printed by other rollers to appear in different shades of color, making the patterns lively, beautiful, and layered. The public-private joint Tongfeng Printing and Dyeing Factory trialed an imported coating dye to dye cloth. The dyed cloth only needs to be steamed before it can leave the factory, unlike cloth dyed with general dyes, which needs to undergo complex processes such as acid and alkali washing after steaming.

    Model 1471 Automatic Weft Winding Machine
    The Shanxi Jingwei Textile Machinery Factory recently successfully trial-produced the Model 1471 automatic weft winding machine.
    The automatic weft winding machine has an extremely precise structure and complete safety devices. Each machine has twenty spindle boxes, and each spindle box has seven automated parts. It has the functions of automatic bobbin unloading, automatic bobbin loading, automatic stop for yarn breakage, and automatic stop for full bobbin. The efficiency of this machine is twice as high as that of ordinary textile machines, greatly reducing workers' physical labor. (Jingwei Factory Newspaper)
    Electric Concrete Vibrator
    China's first latest-style 2 kW electric concrete vibrator has recently been successfully trial-produced at the Anshan Metallurgical Construction Corporation. Load operation tests have proven that its performance is even better than imported goods.
    The characteristics of this latest electric concrete vibrator are its large capacity, high speed, high overload capacity, small size, and convenient use, making it suitable for use in comprehensive construction sites. The successful trial production of this vibrator has created good conditions for the promotion of dry-hard concrete in various places in the future. (Leng Bing)

    新产品新技术
    塑化水泥
    南京公私合营江南水泥厂最近试制成功一种新的水泥——塑化水泥。经过物理性试验，证明这种水泥的可塑性、强度、安定性等都符合标准。
    这种塑化水泥是根据苏联的先进技术经验试制的。在普通水泥熟料中加入造纸工业用的水苇浆废液的塑化剂细磨，就可以制成这种水泥。利用这种水泥来配制混凝土，用量可以比普通水泥节约6％到8％，混凝土的强度、抗冻性和不透水性还比普通水泥配制的混凝土好。这种水泥可以广泛用于一般建筑工程。　（据新华社讯）
    木制桅杆式起重机
    一台木制的桅杆式起重机，在呼和浩特的一个工地上使用了三个星期以后，证明效果良好。
    这台起重机可以把各种重达半吨到一吨左右的钢筋混凝土预制构件，起运到十六公尺以上的高空。它可以在机座下边的小铁轨上前后行走，起重杆可以左右移动，把吊起的起重物放在适当的地方。这座起重机除了联结各个部分的螺丝和设在机座下面的六个铁轱辘以外，其余都用木头制造，成本只八百元。这台木制起重机是由内蒙古城市建设局直属第二工程公司一个工人出身的工区主任佟业科创造的。

    新的印染方法
    上海有三个公私合营印染厂最近试验成功三种新的印染技术。
    公私合营天一印染厂和恒丰印染厂试验成功的两种新的印花方法，都能用较少的印花滚筒印出多种颜色的花布。天一印染厂学习苏联的经验，在一只印花滚筒上涂上助染剂，使其他滚筒印出的花纹出现深浅颜色，花纹显得活泼、漂亮而又富有层次。公私合营同丰印染厂试用一种进口涂染染料染布，染出的布只要经过蒸箱蒸过就可以出厂，不像用一般染料印染的布，在蒸过以后还要经过汰酸、汰碱等复杂的处理过程。　（新华社）
    1471型自动卷纬机
    山西经纬纺织机械厂最近试制1471型自动卷纬机成功。
    自动卷纬机结构极为精密，并且有完整的安全装置。每台机器有二十个锭箱，每个锭箱设有七个自动化部分。它有自动卸管、自动装管、断头自停、满管自停的效能。这种机器的效能比一般纺机高出两倍，大大减轻了工人的体力劳动。

    电动混凝土震动器
    我国第一台最新式的二瓩电动混凝土震动器，最近在鞍山冶金建筑总公司试制成功。经过负荷运转试验证明，它的效能比进口货还好。
    这个最新式电动混凝土震动器的特点是，容量大，转数多，过载能力高，而且体积小，使用方便，适合于综合工地使用。这个震动器的试制成功，给今后各地推广干硬性混凝土创造了良好条件。
