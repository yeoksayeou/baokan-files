　　Now, the idea of diversified economy has been accepted by many leaders of agricultural cooperatives, and sideline production in many rural areas has begun to become active. This is a good phenomenon. However, some signs indicate that some incorrect practices are hidden in the bustling sideline production activities in some places, which deserve close attention.

　　In sideline production, one bad practice is to be greedy for immediate gains, destroy economic resources, and disregard long-term interests. For example, in some areas of Guangdong and Fujian, indiscriminate logging has been regarded as the "shortcut" for agricultural cooperatives to increase their income most quickly. No matter what kind of tree or how big the tree is, all are cut down and sold, or burned into charcoal for sale. In this way, the income of agricultural cooperatives has indeed increased rapidly; unfortunately, precious forest resources have suffered! May I ask how long this kind of sideline production of killing the hen to get the eggs can be managed? Today, income is increased by plundering resources, but how will we live in the future?

　　Another bad practice is to only care about making money, regardless of product quality, and regardless of the needs of the country and the people. According to some local pharmaceutical companies and supply and marketing cooperatives, the quality of medicinal materials produced by many agricultural cooperatives is very poor, and even adulteration and deception have been found. The "Qingdai" medicinal materials sold in large quantities by four agricultural cooperatives in Jiaohu Township and three agricultural cooperatives in Taiyang Township, Fengcheng County, Jiangxi, were originally counterfeits made of indigo dregs (the residue left after dyeing cloth with indigo) mixed with soil and pigments. Of course, the practice of passing off fake goods as genuine goods is only an isolated phenomenon. However, the phenomenon of not paying attention to the quality and specifications of products in sideline production is not uncommon. If this situation is not corrected and prevented as soon as possible, it will inevitably lead to the consequence of stockpiling and losing money for sideline products of agricultural cooperatives.

　　Another bad practice is to go beyond the scope of rural sideline occupations and engage in commerce or certain handicrafts that should be operated by handicraft workers in market towns according to the division of labor. Xuguang Cooperative in Shuangqiao Township, Gucheng County, Hubei Province, set up a grocery store in the market. The Worker-Peasant Alliance Agricultural Cooperative in Huwan Township, Gucheng County, opened a dyeing workshop in the market, which reduced the turnover of the original dyeing workshops in the market town. Many agricultural cooperatives in Huaiyin County, Jiangsu Province, have established handicraft product stores in the towns. Obviously, this practice will not only weaken the agricultural cooperatives' strength in operating agriculture, but also create contradictions between agricultural cooperatives and handicrafts, grass-roots supply and marketing cooperatives, and small vendors, causing chaos in the rural market.

　　Developing sideline production and striving to ensure that more than 90% of the members increase their income is of course a good thing; but it is wrong to use all means to increase income regardless of the consequences. County and district leading organs should not just generally call for the development of sideline production, and should not be blindly complacent and let it go when they see that sideline production has begun to become active; instead, they should patiently help the staff of agricultural cooperatives understand what the correct business policy is, and formulate practical sideline production plans under the guidance of the correct business policy. With a correct plan, coupled with timely and specific guidance in the implementation of the plan, the sideline production of agricultural cooperatives can embark on the correct path and develop more and more actively.

### 增加收入要走正确的路

    增加收入要走正确的路
    陈昭
    现在，多种经营的思想已经为许多农业社的领导人员接受，许多农村里的副业生产开始活跃起来。这是好现象。但是，某些迹象表明：在一些地方的热热闹闹的副业生产活动中，隐藏着一些不正确的做法，值得密切注意。
    在副业生产中，有一种不好的做法是：贪图眼前得利，破坏经济资源，不顾长远利益。如在广东和福建的一些地方，滥砍林木被当成了农业社最快地增加收入的“窍门”，不管什么树和多大的树，统统砍下卖掉，或烧炭出售。这样一来，农业社的收入确实很快地增加了；不幸的是，珍贵的森林资源却遭了殃！试问这种杀鸡取蛋式的副业究竟能经营多久？今天靠掠夺资源而增加了收入，可是，将来的日子怎么过呢？
    又一种不好的做法是：只顾自己赚钱，不顾产品质量，不顾国家和人民的需要。据有些地方的药材公司和供销合作社反映：许多农业社生产的药材质量很差，甚至还发现搀假骗人的现象。江西丰城县蛟湖乡四个农业社和太阳乡的三个农业社大量出卖的药材“青黛”，原来是用靛脚（土靛染布后剩下的渣滓）搀合泥土和颜料制成的伪造品。当然，以假货充真货的，只是个别现象。但是，在副业生产中不注意产品质量规格的现象，却不是很少见的。这种情况如果不及早纠正和防止，必将招致农业社副业产品积压和亏本的后果。
    还有一种不好的做法是：超出农村副业应有的范围，去经营商业或者按照分工应由集镇手工业者经营的某些手工业。湖北谷城县双桥乡旭光社在集市上设了一个杂货门市部。谷城县胡湾乡工农联盟农业社在集市上开设了一处染坊，使集镇上原有的染坊营业额下降。江苏淮阴县有不少农业社在镇上设立手工业品门市部。显然，这种做法，不但会削弱农业社经营农业的力量，而且会造成农业社同手工业、基层供销社、小商小贩之间的矛盾，引起农村市场的混乱。
    发展副业生产，争取或保证90％以上的社员增加收入，这当然是好事情；但是为了增加收入而不择手段，不顾后果，就不对了。县区领导机关不应该只是一般地号召开展副业生产，不应该看到副业生产开始活跃便盲目自满，放任自流；而应该耐心地帮助农业社的工作人员了解正确的经营方针是什么，并且在正确的经营方针指导之下订出切实可行的副业生产计划。有了正确的计划，再加上执行计划中的及时而具体的指导，才能使农业社的副业生产走上正确的道路，越来越活跃地发展起来。
