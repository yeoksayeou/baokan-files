Xinhua News Agency, London, November 14th: The British government's aggression against Egypt has brought serious consequences to the British economy, causing widespread anxiety in Britain.

    Wilson, the main spokesman for the British Labour Party on economic issues, emphasized in the House of Commons on the 12th the impact of the military action against Egypt on the lives of the British people. He said that the five million pounds saved by recent measures such as cutting health care costs and abolishing the last subsidies on milk and bread prices were all lost in the flames of Port Said. He believes that the cost of Britain's three-day war against Egypt is more than the total amount of money needed to meet all the demands for raising the wages of the British working people. According to his estimates, mobilizing the army for the invasion of Egypt costs about one million pounds per week, and mobilizing the navy costs about 400,000 pounds per week.
    According to a Reuters report, the direct economic impact of the Middle East crisis on British families is: reduced gasoline and oil, reduced heat output from central heating companies, and insufficient Christmas food and rising prices.
    The British "Financial Times" pointed out on November 10 that the British economy is facing an infinitely long period of severity due to the canal blockade and the cutting off of Middle East oil pipelines. The newspaper analyzed that "the longer transportation routes around the Cape of Good Hope" and "the lack of ships" leading to increased freight rates, "buying oil in US dollars," and "importing more coal from the United States" will exacerbate Britain's balance of payments crisis. British exports, which were already lagging behind in international trade, have also begun to be affected by the aggression against Egypt. According to Reuters, due to a shortage of ships, some automobile manufacturers are experiencing considerable difficulties in handling overseas orders. For example, Vauxhall has announced that shipments to the Middle East have been completely suspended, and the space required to ship orders to other parts of the world has become a major problem.
    Reuters reported that the greatest fear now existing in the various industrial sectors striving to export is that the current delays and difficulties, coupled with the possible increase in freight rates, will mean that Britain will completely lose some overseas markets as competitors take advantage of the situation.
    Xinhua News Agency, London, November 15th: The British government continues to suffer the economic consequences of its aggression against Egypt. According to the latest news, the British government-run highway freight system has decided to stop using 1,500 trucks due to gasoline shortages.
    People at local gas stations are asking drivers who come to refuel to add one gallon of gasoline less. The government requires the public to drive less for travel.
    British central heating companies that use oil as fuel are no longer delivering heat as hot as usual, and often have to stop delivery.
    It is said that the British government is ready to implement oil and gasoline rationing plans, which will be implemented when oil supplies continue to decline.
    Xinhua News Agency, Paris, November 15th, TASS dispatch on November 14th: According to "Echoes," the French treasury will have to pay a "huge expense" due to France's participation in the armed intervention against Egypt. The newspaper said that the Algerian war has made France's military budget this year reach an unprecedented figure of 1,284 billion francs, which is 130 billion francs more than last year's military budget. "Echoes" pointed out that, according to preliminary statistics, intervening in Egypt costs France about 1 billion francs per day. In addition, there is already a shortage of oil and petroleum products in the country, and the prices of various industrial raw materials from the Far East - rubber, chromium, zinc, manganese, tea, etc. - are also soaring.
    "Echoes" also said that France will be forced to import cotton from the United States, Peru, or Sudan in the future, instead of from Egypt as in the past. France will also have to buy American oil, which will increase France's additional expenses.

    英法自食侵埃战争恶果
    军费大增·石油缺乏·输出困难
    新华社14日讯　伦敦消息：英国政府侵略埃及行动给英国经济带来严重的后果，在英国普遍地引起不安。
    英国工党经济问题的主要发言人威尔逊12日在下院着重谈到了侵埃军事行动对英国人民生活的影响。他说，靠最近节省卫生事业费用和取消对牛奶和面包减价的最后一笔补助金等措施节省下来的五百万英镑，全都葬送在塞得港的火焰里了。他认为，英国对埃及进行战争三天中所花的费用，比满足提高英国劳动人民工资的一切要求所需要的钱总数还要多。据他估计，为侵略埃及而动员陆军，每周约花费一百万英镑，动员海军费用每周约四十万英镑。
    据路透社报道说，中东危机对英国家庭所产生的直接经济影响是：汽油和石油减少，中央暖气公司放热量减少，以及圣诞节食物不足和物价上涨。
    英国“金融时报”11月10日指出，英国经济由于运河封锁和中东油管被切断，正面临无限长的严重时期，这家报纸分析说，“绕道好望角的较长的运输路程”和“船只的缺乏”所导致的运费的增加、“用美元购买石油”和“由美国进口更大量的煤”，将加剧英国的支付平衡危机，在国际贸易中已经落后的英国输出也开始受到侵埃行动的影响。据路透社消息说，由于船舶不足，有一些汽车制造厂在处理海外定货方面遭到相当大的困难。例如沃克斯霍尔公司已经宣布，去中东的货运已经完全停止，向世界其它地方运送定货所需的舱位已经成为主要问题。
    路透社报道说，现在在努力进行输出的各工业部门存在的最大恐惧是，目前的耽误和困难加上运费的可能的增加，将意味着由于竞争者利用这种局势而使英国的某些海外市场完全丧失。
    新华社15日讯　伦敦消息：英国政府在继续自食侵略埃及的经济恶果。据最新的消息说，英国政府办的公路货运系统因为汽油缺乏决定停止使用一千五百辆卡车。
    各地方加油站的人要求前来加油的驾驶员都少加一加仑汽油。政府要求公众少驾驶汽车出游。
    靠石油作燃料的英国中央暖气公司放送的暖气已经不像往常那样热了，而且常常要停止放送。
    据说，英国政府已经准备好实行石油和汽油配给计划，这个计划在石油供应继续下降时就要执行。
    新华社15日讯　塔斯社巴黎14日讯：据“回声报”指出，由于法国参加对埃及的武装干涉，法国国库将不得不付出一笔“浩大的开销”。报纸说，阿尔及利亚战争使得法国今年的军事预算达到一万二千八百四十亿法郎的空前数字，比去年的军事预算多了一千三百亿法郎。“回声报”指出，根据初步的统计，对埃及进行干涉，使法国每天要花费约十亿法郎。此外，国内已经感到缺乏石油和石油产品，来自远东的各种工业原料——橡胶、铬、锌、锰、茶叶等的价格也都在猛涨。
    “回声报”还说，法国今后将被迫从美国、秘鲁或苏丹而不像过去从埃及输入棉花。法国还不得不购买美国的石油，这都将使法国增加额外开支。
