Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 18th. Hong Kong News: The Tsuen Wan Trade Union clubhouse and welfare institutions, which were severely damaged by Kuomintang secret agents, have been restored, and the unity of Hong Kong and Kowloon workers has been further strengthened. This was stated by representatives of the Hong Kong and Kowloon Textile Dyeing Industry Workers' General Union, the Hong Kong and Kowloon Enamelware Industry General Union, the Hong Kong and Kowloon Silk Weaving Industry General Union, and the Hong Kong and Kowloon Rubber and Plastics Industry General Union at a reception held on the 16th. Two hundred representatives from dozens of trade unions in Hong Kong and Kowloon attended the reception.

Huang Yanfang, Chairman of the Hong Kong and Kowloon Textile Dyeing Workers' Union, who spoke at the reception, said: "In less than a month, our clubhouse and welfare institutions have been restored, and they are brand new and more spectacular than before."

She said, "We want to thank our dear motherland. People's organizations and compatriots in the motherland not only wrote many letters of condolence to give us comfort and encouragement, but also donated a large sum of money in a timely manner to give us material support, so that the work of comforting the dead and healing the wounded of the affected workers can be carried out quickly. Compatriots in the motherland also designated funds for us to restore the clubhouse and welfare institutions. This meticulous, brotherly care not only allowed our wounds to heal quickly, but also gave us infinite courage and confidence."

She also pointed out: After the Kowloon riots, more workers in Hong Kong and Kowloon recognized the criminal faces of the Kuomintang secret agents. Therefore, the workers are more united than before, and the trade unions are more supported by the workers than before. We also have great confidence in continuing to strengthen workers' unity and developing workers' welfare undertakings.

Chen Yaocai, Chairman of the Hong Kong and Kowloon Federation of Trade Unions, was invited to speak at the meeting. He said: The workers in the Tsuen Wan area have undergone a severe test in the riots created by Kuomintang secret agents. What we have seen is that the unity and welfare of the workers are still growing and developing strongly, no matter how difficult the environment. He said that the rapid restoration of trade unions and welfare institutions after serious damage is primarily due to the care and support of the motherland. Compatriots in the motherland gave us deep condolences and timely assistance, enabling our work of comforting the dead and healing the wounded and the restoration of the clubhouse to be completed smoothly, giving us infinite warmth and confidence.

    被破坏的九龙荃湾工会在祖国支援下
    会所和福利机构已恢复　工人的团结进一步加强
    新华社广州18日电　香港消息：曾被国民党特务分子严重破坏的荃湾工会会所和福利机构已经恢复，港九工人的团结已进一步加强。这是港九纺织染业职工总会、港九搪瓷业总工会、港九丝织业总工会、港九树胶塑胶业总工会等四个单位的代表，在16日举行的招待会上作报告时说的。出席这次招待会的，有港九数十个工会的代表二百人。
    在招待会上作报告的港九纺织染工会主席黄燕芳说：“在不到一个月的期间内，我们的会所和福利机构重新恢复起来了，而且焕然一新，比以前更壮观。”
    她说，我们要感谢亲爱的祖国。祖国的人民团体和广大同胞，不但写来了许多慰问信，给我们以慰问和鼓舞，还及时地捐了大笔款项，给我们以物质的支持，使受害工友的恤死扶伤工作能够迅速进行。祖国同胞还指定款项给我们作恢复会所和福利机构的费用。这种无微不至、亲如兄弟的关怀，不但使我们的创伤很快就复原，而且给我们以无限的勇气和信心。
    她还指出：在九龙暴乱事件之后，港九有更多的工人认清了国民党特务分子的罪恶面目。因此，工人比以前更团结了，工会比以前更受工人的拥护与支持。我们对于继续加强工人的团结、发展工人的福利事业，也有了极大的信心。
    港九工会联合会理事长陈耀材在会上应邀讲话。他说：荃湾区的工人在国民党特务分子制造的暴乱中经受了一次严重的考验。我们看到的事实是，工人的团结和福利事业，不论在怎样困难的环境中，还是坚强地成长和发展起来了。他说，工会和福利机构能够在严重的破坏后迅速恢复，首先是由于祖国的关怀和支援。祖国同胞给我们以深切的慰问和及时的援助，使我们的恤死扶伤工作和会所恢复工作能够顺利完成，使我们得到无限的温暖和信心。
