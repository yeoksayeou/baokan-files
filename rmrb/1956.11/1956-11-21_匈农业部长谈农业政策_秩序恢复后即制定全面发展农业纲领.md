Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, November 20th: According to a report in the "People's Will" here on November 18th, Imre Dögei, the Minister of Agriculture of the Hungarian Revolutionary Worker-Peasant Government, said that the Revolutionary Worker-Peasant Government condemns the errors in past agricultural policies because they caused immeasurable spiritual and material losses to farmers, and the supply to industrial workers and urban residents was constantly in an insecure state.

Dögei said that in the future, the Revolutionary Worker-Peasant Government will provide material support to individual farmers in the same way as it does to production cooperatives. After order is restored, the government will formulate a comprehensive program for agricultural development. He said that the government will allow farmers to freely choose their methods of operation. Those who want to work independently can do so, and those who want to cooperate can do so. The government will make it possible for individual farmers and cooperatives to produce what they want to produce and freely dispose of their products. The government recognizes farmers' private ownership and will make it possible to buy and sell land. At the same time, the government will not allow farms based on exploitation to appear in the future.

Dögei said that the government has decided to meet the reasonable demands of farmers, and therefore agrees to abolish the grain requisitioning system and guarantees that farmers can freely sell their products. At the same time, the government will end the phenomenon of forcibly organizing cooperatives and adjusting land.

    匈农业部长谈农业政策
    秩序恢复后即制定全面发展农业纲领
    新华社布达佩斯20日电　据这里的“人民意志报”11月18日刊载工农革命政府农业部部长伊姆雷·道吉的谈话说：工农革命政府斥责过去农业政策上的错误，因为它使农民遭到无可计量的精神上和物质上的损失，而使产业工人和城市居民的供应经常处于没有保证的状态。
    道吉说，今后工农革命政府将像对待生产合作社一样给予个体农民以物质支持。等秩序恢复以后，政府将拟制全面的发展农业的纲领。他说，政府将让农民自由选择经营方法。愿意单干的就单干，愿意合作的就合作，政府将使个体农民和合作社都有可能生产他们愿意生产的东西，并自由地处理其产品。政府承认农民私有制，并将使土地有可能买卖，同时政府今后也不允许以剥削为基础的农庄出现。
    道吉说，政府决定满足农民的合理要求，因此同意取消粮食征购制，并且保证农民能自由出售产品。政府同时将终止强行组织合作社和调整土地的现象。
