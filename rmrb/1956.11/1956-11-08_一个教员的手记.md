    A Teacher's Notes
    Lin Ye
    I think Lao Li has probably seen it, because he kept looking at me. We always go home together after class, chatting and laughing, but today, I really can't laugh. I can't forget what happened in class just now. I haven't been this angry in a long time, and I think teaching is really boring...
    "Lao Lin, what's wrong?" Lao Li probably couldn't help but ask.
    "Sigh! What can I say? I've never seen such students. I wish the leaders would transfer me to be a clerk!" I couldn't hold back my anger any longer.
    "Ah, is it that serious?"
    "Teachers get up early and go to bed late, and can't even rest on Sundays, preparing lessons and grading papers, exhausting themselves. You lecture, and they don't listen. Just now, while I was lecturing, two or three students were playing below. When I said a few words to them, they didn't even care! They're clearly messing with me!"
    "So we have to educate them—"
    "Forget it! Don't lecture me with grand principles. This is a fact, and I can't take it!"
    I cut Lao Li off, and he fell silent. We walked in silence, the night gradually becoming hazy.
    We arrived home. As soon as I entered, my child ran over, shaking something in his hand, and shouted in his unclear pronunciation, "Dad, letter!"
    I took it and looked at it. It was from Yumen. Who is it? I don't have any friends in Yumen? I opened it and saw the opening address was "Teacher". I quickly looked at the signature below, and a clever, chubby, and still innocent round face appeared before my eyes. I remembered he was a junior high school graduate from the previous year who had gone to work in Yumen. The letter first described the construction in the northwest of the motherland and his own work, mentioning that he had been praised by his leaders at work and had also encountered difficulties. The last paragraph of the letter suddenly caught my attention. He said:
    "Teacher, whenever I complete a task and receive praise from leaders or comrades, whenever I encounter difficulties in my work, I can't help but think of my alma mater, of you and the other teachers. What can I, a junior high school graduate, do? On the road of national construction, I seem like an infant. It was my alma mater, it was the teachers who taught me to take the first step. The honor of my alma mater, the hard work of the teachers, all spur me on, so that I will not be proud because of a little achievement, nor will I bow my head in the face of difficulties.
    "Do you remember? Once in your class, I didn't listen carefully and was playing with a compass in my hand. You probably saw it and asked me a question. Alas, I didn't even hear the question. You criticized me, and I still remember your expression at the time. After class, I regretted it. I felt ashamed and knew I was wrong. But I didn't have the courage to go to your office and admit my mistake. I thought, let me express my repentance with concrete actions! After that, I really paid attention in every class. I have always kept these things in my heart. Today, I decided to tell you anyway. I don't want to say thank you, because what the teachers give us is really not something that a thank you can express!"
    I read this paragraph over and over again, tears filling my eyes. A warmth rushed up from the depths of my heart and spread throughout my body.
    My mother brought over the reheated food. I even forgot to pick up my chopsticks for a moment.
    The next morning, after the first class, I ran into Lao Li, who smiled at me. I didn't know if he was just smiling casually or if it had a deeper meaning, but I felt like I had been slapped in the face, and my face was burning. I quickly stopped him and said:
    "Lao Li, what I said yesterday was too one-sided. I only saw part of the truth, and there was another part that I didn't see, and that is also the truth!"
    Lao Li smiled as if he understood and didn't understand. (Attached picture)
    We always go home together after class, chatting and laughing, but today, I really can't laugh.

    一个教员的手记
    林夜
    我想，老李大概已经看出来了，因为他频频地注视我。每天下课我们一道回家，总是说说笑笑，而今天，我实在笑不起来。刚才上课的情形怎么也不能忘掉。我许久没有这样气愤了，心想教书真没有意思……
    “老林，怎么回事？”老李大概忍不住了。
    “咳！怎么说呢？真没见过这样的学生，让领导调我做职员吧！”我的一肚子的气再也按捺不住。
    “啊，何至于如此严重？”
    “教师起早睡晚，甚至星期日都不能休息，备课、改本子，费了九牛二虎之力，你讲课，他不听。刚才就是，我在上边讲课，两三个学生在下边玩。说他们几句，还满不在乎！明明是跟我捣蛋！”
    “所以咱们得教育——”
    “算了！别讲大道理了，这是事实，我受不了！”
    我一下子把老李的话堵了回去，他不响了。我们默默地走着，夜色已渐朦胧。
    到了家。一进门，孩子就跑过来，手里摇着一个什么东西，用他那咬不清的字音喊：“爸爸，信！”
    接过来一看，是从玉门寄来的。谁呢，我在玉门没有朋友啊？拆开看，开头的称呼是“老师”，急忙翻看下面的署名，我眼前浮现出一个聪明的胖胖的还没有失去天真的圆脸。我想起他是上届的初中毕业生，到玉门去工作了。信上先描述了祖国西北的建设，他自己的工作，谈到他在工作中曾受到领导的表扬，也碰到过困难。信中的最后一段，突然吸引了我的注意，他说：
    “老师，每当我完成一件工作，受到领导或同志们的称赞的时候，每当我在工作中碰到困难的时候，不由得就想起了母校，想起了您和其他的老师。我，一个初中毕业生，能做些什么呢？在祖国建设的道路上，我好像是个婴儿。是母校，是老师们教给我迈出了第一步。母校的荣誉，老师们的辛勤劳动，都鞭策着我，使我不会因为一点点的成就而骄傲，也不会在困难面前低头。
    “您还记得吧？有一次在上您的课时，我没有好好听讲，手里玩着圆规。您大概看出来了，向我提出了一个问题，唉，我连问题都没有听见。您批评了我，而我当时的态度还很不好。您生气了，我到现在还记得您的脸色。下课后，我就后悔了，我感到惭愧，知道我错了。但是，我没有勇气走进您的办公室，向您承认错误。我想，用具体行动来表示我的悔过吧！以后，我也真的每堂都注意听讲了。这些我一直梗在心里。今天，我决定还是向您说说，我不想向您说什么感谢，因为老师给我们的东西，实在不是一声感谢所能表示得了的！……”
    我反复把这一段看了好几遍，泪水充满眼眶，一丝温暖从心的深处冲上来，片刻布满了全身。
    母亲端来了热好的饭菜。我一时竟忘记了举筷子。
    第二天早晨，下了第一节课，我碰见老李，他向我一笑。我不知道他是随便一笑，还是别有含意，但我觉得好像是挨了个耳光，脸上热辣辣的。我急忙拉住他说：
    “老李，昨天我说的话太片面。我只看到一部分事实，还有一部分我没看见，那也是事实！”
    老李像听懂了又像没听懂地笑了笑。（附图片）
    每天下课我们一道回家，总是说说笑笑，而今天，我实在笑不起来。
