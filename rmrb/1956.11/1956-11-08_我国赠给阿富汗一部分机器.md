Xinhua News Agency, Kabul, 7th. The Chinese government has gifted sixteen types of machines, recently exhibited in the Chinese pavilion at the Afghan Independence Day Industrial Exhibition, to the Afghan government. The donation ceremony was held in Kabul on November 4th. These machines include portable diesel air compressors, universal lathes, milling machines, drilling machines, automatic rake harvesters, and complete sets of pharmaceutical equipment.

    When Chinese Ambassador Ding Guoyu represented the Chinese government in donating these machines, he described the recent development of the traditional ties between the two countries and expressed the hope that the Afghan government would accept this gift as a symbol of friendship.

    Afghan Minister of Mines Yusuf, on behalf of the Afghan government, expressed his gratitude to the Chinese government and people when accepting the gift. He said that through the Chinese exhibition hall, the Afghan people have become convinced that China's progress is not a myth, but a fact and reality, and the friendly relations between the two countries have been further promoted. He expressed his admiration for the Chinese government's efforts to maintain world peace and believed that such efforts are an important asset of mankind, especially at a time when imperialists are plotting to restore colonialism.

    At the donation ceremony, Wang Hanmin, head of the Chinese exhibition delegation, also presented a huge woolen portrait of the King of Afghanistan to Yusuf, asking him to forward it to Prime Minister Daud Khan.

    我国赠给阿富汗一部分机器
    新华社7日讯　喀布尔消息：中国政府已经把最近在阿富汗独立日工业博览会中国馆中展览的十六种机器送给阿富汗政府。赠送仪式于11月4日在喀布尔举行。这些机器包括轻便柴油空气压缩器、万能车床、铣床、钻床、自动耙割机和全套制药器具等。
    中国大使丁国钰在代表中国政府赠送这些机器的时候，叙述了两国之间的传统联系在最近的发展，并表示希望阿富汗政府接受这项礼物作为友谊的象征。
    阿富汗矿务大臣优素福在代表阿富汗政府接受礼物时向中国政府和人民表示感谢。他说，通过中国展览馆，阿富汗人已经相信中国的进展并不是神话，而是事实和现实，两国之间的友好关系因而得到进一步的促进。他表示钦佩中国政府为了维护世界和平而作的努力，并且认为这种努力是人类的一种重要的财产，特别是在帝国主义者阴谋恢复殖民主义的时候。
    在赠礼时，中国展览团团长王汉民还把一幅巨大的阿富汗国王的毛织画像送给优素福，要求他转交给达乌德汗首相。
