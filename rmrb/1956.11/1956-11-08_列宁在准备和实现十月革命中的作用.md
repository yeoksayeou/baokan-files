    Lenin's Role in Preparing and Implementing the October Revolution
    Soviet Union, I. Verkhovtsev
    Thirty-nine years ago, on November 7, 1917 (October 25th by the old calendar), Russia completed the Great October Socialist Revolution, marking the beginning of a fundamental transformation in world history and the transition from the old, capitalist world to the new, socialist world. The victory of the October Revolution was a victory for the vibrant ideas of Leninism and for the wise Leninist strategy and tactics of the Communist Party. The Communist Party was the inspirer and organizer of the masses of urban and rural working people in the heroic struggle to transition from the bourgeois-democratic revolution to the socialist revolution.
    The Second Russian Bourgeois-Democratic Revolution, which overthrew the Tsarist autocracy on March 12, 1917 (February 27th by the old calendar), was victorious. In the course of this revolution, two powers were formed: the bourgeois power represented by the Provisional Government, and the worker-peasant power represented by the Soviets of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies, established by the insurgent masses based on the experience of the 1905 Russian Revolution.
    Relying on the armed workers and soldiers, the Soviets in fact possessed actual power. However, the majority of seats in the Soviets were occupied by representatives of the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries—petty-bourgeois parties. These compromisers guided the Soviets to support the Provisional Government, which continued the former Tsarist government's domestic and foreign policies, economically enslaving the working people and continuing the world imperialist war.
    In such a complex situation, many leaders of the Bolshevik Party, who had just transitioned from a state of secrecy to legality, could not immediately formulate a correct strategy and tactics for concentrating all power in the hands of the Soviets and transitioning from the bourgeois-democratic revolution to the socialist revolution. The Party clearly felt the absence of its leader, Vladimir Ilyich Lenin, who, due to the conspiracies of Russian, British, and French imperialists, had to continue living in exile abroad until April 1917.
    As a great internationalist and patriot, Lenin felt a justified pride because the lofty honor and great happiness of first breaking through international imperialism by revolutionary means fell on the Russian workers. At that time, international imperialism was dragging humanity into the endless disasters of world war.
    In his "Letters from Afar" written from Switzerland, Lenin called on the Russian workers, who had displayed miracles of proletarian and popular heroism in the struggle to overthrow the Tsarist regime, to display miracles of proletarian and popular organization in order to prepare themselves for victory in the second stage of the revolution. After returning to Russia, V.I. Lenin developed this idea in his famous April Theses, writing:
    "The peculiarity of the present situation in Russia is that it represents a transition from the first stage of the revolution—which, owing to the insufficient class-consciousness and organisation of the proletariat, placed power in the hands of the bourgeoisie—to its second stage, which must place power in the hands of the proletariat and the poorest sections of the peasants."
    (Lenin, Collected Works, Russian Edition, Vol. 24, p. 4)
    In his April Theses and in other speeches, V.I. Lenin illuminated the question of the further development of the Russian revolution with the brilliance of creative Marxism: regarding the characteristics of the current domestic situation, the attitude of the proletariat and its party towards the war and the bourgeois Provisional Government, and towards parliamentary republics and Soviet republics; regarding the path to Soviet victory and the implementation of urgent reforms in cities and villages, the further strengthening of the Bolshevik Party (Communist Party) and the world revolutionary workers' movement.
    Lenin's April Theses, endorsed by the Party's Seventh Congress (April Congress), provided the Bolshevik Party with a theoretically grounded and concrete plan in the struggle to transition to the socialist revolution. The Party prepared for the solution of this historic task with the experience of the past two Russian revolutions and the genius of its leader.
    As early as the period of the First Russian Revolution of 1905-1907—the first people's revolution in the era of imperialism—Lenin armed the Bolshevik Party and the world revolutionary workers' movement with the theory of the transformation of the bourgeois-democratic revolution into a socialist revolution. During the years of the First World War, Lenin enriched this theory with the brilliant conclusion regarding the possibility of socialism first being victorious in a few or even in a single country, and regarding the conditions and prospects of this victory. He predicted that, due to the laws of social development, all nations would inevitably move towards socialism, but that in terms of democratic forms, the forms of proletarian dictatorship, and the stages of socialist transformation in all aspects of social life, each nation would have its own characteristics.
    Lenin wrote during the period of preparation for the October Revolution: "The transition from capitalism to communism is certainly bound to yield a tremendous abundance and variety of political forms, but the essence will inevitably be the same: the dictatorship of the proletariat." (Lenin, Collected Works, Russian Edition, Vol. 25, p. 385)
    In the two Russian revolutions, a new and powerful weapon of struggle—the Soviets of Workers' Deputies—was formed by revolutionary creation. Based on a profound Marxist analysis of the experience of these two revolutions, Lenin scientifically proved that Soviet power was the most appropriate form of the dictatorship of the Russian working class. He emphasized that if the people of the revolutionary class did not establish Soviets, then the Russian socialist revolution would be hopeless.
    V.I. Lenin skillfully, confidently, firmly, and cautiously guided the Party, the working class, and the people towards the victory of the socialist revolution. His energy was truly inexhaustible. In the first three months after arriving in Russia alone, he wrote more than one hundred and fifty articles and several pamphlets. At the same time, Lenin often spoke in factories in Petrograd. He passionately and fervently exposed the anti-popular essence of the policies of the bourgeois Provisional Government, and exposed the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries, calling on the workers and soldiers to unite closely around the Bolsheviks under the Bolshevik battle cry of "All Power to the Soviets!"
    From April to June, Lenin's Bolshevik slogan of "All Power to the Soviets!" meant that the working class would seize power and achieve the socialist revolution by peaceful means, that is, by the Communists winning a majority in the Soviets and seizing all power in the Soviets without an armed uprising against the Provisional Government.
    But in July, the Provisional Government, with the help of the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries, seized all power into its own hands, opened fire on the peaceful march of workers in Petrograd, and attacked the revolutionary organizations of the working people; the peaceful period of the revolution came to an end. The Bolshevik Party had to return to a state of secrecy again, hiding its leader V.I. Lenin to avoid persecution by the bourgeois reactionaries.
    While in hiding, Lenin did not stop leading the Party for a single minute. During the last period of his concealment—from July to October—Lenin wrote more than sixty articles, pamphlets, and letters to the Central Committee of the Party and to some local committees. In these documents, Lenin deeply analyzed the changes in the domestic political and economic situation and class relations, and gave instructions on changing the tactics of struggle.
    The proletariat of Russia heard the voice of its leader from the deepest secrecy, and felt his strong leadership.
    The Bolshevik Party's Sixth Congress, held secretly in Petrograd at the end of July, announced, according to Lenin's instructions, the policy of winning the victory of the socialist revolution by means of an armed uprising against the bourgeois Provisional Government. The violence of the increasingly brutal and barbaric bourgeois reactionaries must be answered with the violence of the revolutionary masses.
    On Lenin's suggestion, the Party temporarily withdrew the slogan "All Power to the Soviets!" because after the July events, the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries had turned the Soviets into pitiful appendages of the Provisional Government, so the slogan was now objectively deceiving the people. V.I. Lenin and the Party believed that under appropriate conditions it would be possible and necessary to raise the question of all power to the Soviets again. And such a period came quickly.
    At the end of August, workers, soldiers, and sailors, responding to the call of the Bolshevik Central Committee, united to defend Red Petrograd and crushed the conspiracy of General Kornilov, who attempted to suppress the revolution and establish his own military dictatorship. During the days of fighting against the Kornilovites, the Party activated all organizations of the working people, especially the organizations of the Soviets of Workers', Soldiers', and Peasants' Deputies. Under these conditions, the Party considered it necessary to re-propose the slogan "All Power to the Soviets!" and closely linked this slogan to the preparation for armed insurrection.
    This slogan had particular power when the Bolsheviks gained a majority in such decisive Soviets as Petrograd and Moscow. Therefore, Lenin wrote to the Central Committee of the Party and the Petrograd and Moscow Committees on October 21-24 that the Bolsheviks could and must now overcome the resistance of the surrenderists such as Kamenev, Zinoviev, and Trotsky and seize power. The Party unfolded huge political, organizational, and military-technical work to prepare for the armed uprising. At the same time, the Bolsheviks persistently prepared for the Second All-Russian Congress of Soviets, hoping to gain an absolute majority at this congress.
    In preparing for the inevitable armed struggle with the counter-revolutionary forces, the Bolshevik Party followed Lenin's wise instructions. Lenin taught us in theory and in practice to regard insurrection as the greatest art. Lenin developed Marx's and Engels' instructions on this question, and put forward the following five important principles of the art of proletarian popular uprising:
    "First, never play with insurrection, but when beginning it realise firmly that you must go to the end.
    "Second, concentrate a great superiority of forces at the decisive point, at the decisive moment, otherwise the enemy, who has better preparation and organisation, will destroy the insurgents.
    "Third, once the insurrection has begun, you must act with the greatest determination, and by all means, without fail, take the offensive. 'Defence is the death of an armed rising.'
    "Fourth, you must try to take the enemy by surprise and seize the moment when his forces are scattered.
    "Fifth, you must strive for daily successes, however small (one might say hourly, if it is the matter of one city), and at all costs retain 'moral superiority.'" (Lenin, Collected Works, Russian Edition, Vol. 26, p. 152)
    Based on these principles, Lenin formulated a concrete plan for the armed uprising: to encircle and cut off Petrograd, and to occupy it by simultaneously attacking with the fleet, armed workers' Red Guards, and revolutionary troops. Lenin proposed coordinating the combat actions of these three main forces, making sure they occupied Petrograd and holding such key points as the telephone exchange, telegraph office, railway stations, and bridges at any cost. The insurgent workers, soldiers, and sailors acted according to Lenin's plan.
    Lenin's secret arrival in Petrograd in October 1917 and his extremely skillful selection of the most appropriate moment to begin the uprising were of great significance for the preparation and implementation of the armed uprising. On the night of October 24, Lenin said in a letter from his hiding place to the members of the Central Committee of the Bolshevik Party: "History will not forgive revolutionaries who procrastinate when they could be victorious today (and they certainly will be victorious today), risking the loss of much, losing everything, by delaying until tomorrow." (Lenin, Collected Works, Russian Edition, Vol. 26, p. 204)
    On the night of October 25 (November 7), V.I. Lenin arrived at the famous Smolny Palace, which was the combat headquarters of the proletarian revolution. Lenin directly led the armed uprising with the help of the military leadership center of the Petrograd Soviet of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies established by the Central Committee of the Communist Party. Bubnov, Dzerzhinsky, Sverdlov, Stalin, and Uritsky participated in this center.
    The wise Leninist strategy and tactics implemented by the Bolshevik Party enabled the Russian working class to overthrow the bourgeois government in October 1917. The Second All-Russian Congress of Soviets, held during the uprising, declared that all power was transferred to the Soviets. The declaration stated: "Relying on the will of the overwhelming majority of workers, soldiers, and peasants, and relying on the victorious uprising carried out by the workers and garrison in Petrograd, the Congress has taken power into its own hands."
    Thirty-nine years have passed since that time, and the working people of the Soviet Union are the sole masters of their great multinational country, and are victoriously building communism under the leadership of the Communist Party.

    列宁在准备和实现十月革命中的作用
    苏联　伊·维尔霍夫采夫
    三十九年以前，1917年11月7日（旧历10月25日），俄国完成了伟大的十月社会主义革命，这表明了整个世界历史根本转变的开端，表明了旧的、资本主义世界向新的社会主义世界转变的开端。十月革命的胜利是列宁主义的生气勃勃的思想的胜利，是共产党英明的列宁主义战略和策略的胜利。共产党是城乡劳动人民群众在从资产阶级民主革命过渡到社会主义革命的英勇斗争中的鼓舞者和组织者。
    1917年3月12日（旧历2月27日）推翻沙皇专制制度的第二次俄国资产阶级民主革命胜利了。在这次革命过程中形成了两个政权：以临时政府为代表的资产阶级政权和由起义群众根据1905年俄国革命经验建立起来的以工兵代表苏维埃为代表的工农政权。
    依靠着武装的工人和士兵的苏维埃事实上拥有实际的权力。但是苏维埃中大多数代表的席位，却被孟什维克和社会革命党人——小资产阶级党派的代表所占据。这些妥协分子引导苏维埃走上支持临时政府的道路，这个临时政府继续从前沙皇政府的对内对外政策，在经济上奴役劳动人民并继续世界帝国主义战争的政策。
    在这样复杂的情况下，刚刚从秘密状态转入合法地位的布尔什维克党的许多领导人，不能立刻拟定把整个政权集中在苏维埃手中和从资产阶级民主革命过渡到社会主义革命的正确战略和策略。党明显地感觉到自己的领袖弗拉基米尔·伊里奇·列宁的不在国内：他由于俄国和英法两国帝国主义分子的阴谋不得不继续侨居国外到1917年4月。
    由于第一次以革命方法突破国际帝国主义的崇高荣誉和伟大幸福落在了俄国工人的身上，作为伟大的国际主义者和爱国者的列宁感到了合理的自豪。当时国际帝国主义正把人类拖入了世界大战的无穷灾难中。
    列宁在从瑞士写的“远方来信”中号召在推翻沙皇制度斗争中表现了无产阶级的、人民的英勇精神奇迹的俄国工人，应当表现出无产阶级和全民组织的奇迹，以准备自己在革命第二阶段上的胜利。弗·伊·列宁在回国以后发展了这一思想，在他著名的四月提纲里写道：
    “俄国时局的特点在于从革命的第一阶段过渡到革命的第二阶段，第一阶段由于无产阶级的觉悟性和组织性不够而使政权落到了资产阶级手中，第二阶段则应当使政权转到无产阶级和贫苦农民阶层手中。”
    （列宁全集，俄文版，第二十四卷第四页）
    弗·伊·列宁在四月提纲里和在其他的一些演说里用创造性的马克思主义的光辉照耀着俄国革命的进一步发展的问题：关于国内当前局势的特点、关于无产阶级和它的政党对于战争和资产阶级临时政府的态度和对于国会制的共和国和苏维埃的共和国的态度；关于苏维埃胜利的道路和关于在城市和乡村实行刻不容缓的改造、关于进一步加强布尔什维克党（共产党）和世界革命工人运动。
    党的第七次代表会议（四月代表会议）所赞同的列宁的四月提纲给布尔什维克党在争取过渡到社会主义革命斗争中以理论上有根据的具体的计划。党用过去的两次俄国革命斗争的经验和自己领袖的天才发现准备了解决这个历史性的任务。
    早在1905—1907年第一次俄国革命时期——这是帝国主义时期的第一次人民革命——列宁就用资产阶级民主革命转变为社会主义革命的理论武装了布尔什维克党和世界革命工人运动。在第一次世界大战的年代中，列宁用关于社会主义首先在几个或者甚至在一个国家里单独获得胜利的可能性和关于这个胜利的条件和前景的天才结论丰富了这一理论。他预言，由于社会发展的规律，一切民族都将不可避免地走到社会主义，但是，在民主形式方面，无产阶级专政的形式方面，在社会生活各个方面的社会主义改造的阶段方面，每一个民族都会有自己的特点。
    列宁在准备十月革命的时期写道：“由资本主义过渡到共产主义当然不能不产生很多和很繁杂的政治形式，但在本质上不免是同一的：无产阶级专政。”（列宁全集，俄文版，第二十五卷第三百八十五页）
    在两次俄国革命时期中，由革命的创造形成了新的强大的斗争武器——工人代表苏维埃。列宁在深刻地以马克思主义分析了这两次革命的经验的基础上，科学地证明了苏维埃政权是俄国工人阶级专政的最适当的形式。他强调指出，如果革命阶级的人民创造不建立苏维埃，那末，俄国的社会主义革命将是没有希望的事情。
    弗·伊·列宁巧妙而确信地、坚定而慎重地引导党、工人阶级和人民走向社会主义革命的胜利。他的精力真正是无穷无尽。仅仅在到达俄国以后的头三个月期间他就写了一百五十篇以上的论文和几本小册子。同时，列宁还常在彼得格勒各工厂中演说。他炽烈而热情地揭露了资产阶级临时政府政策的反人民的本质，揭露了孟什维克和社会革命党人，号召工人和士兵群众在布尔什维克的“全部政权归苏维埃！”的战斗口号下紧密地团结在布尔什维克的周围。
    从4月到6月这几个月中，列宁的、布尔什维克的“全部政权归苏维埃！”的口号意味着由工人阶级掌握政权和用和平的方法来实现社会主义革命，即由共产党人争得苏维埃中的多数，不用武装起义反对临时政府而把苏维埃的全部政权掌握在自己的手中。
    但是在7月，临时政府在孟什维克和社会革命党人的帮助下把全部政权都夺到自己的手中，向彼得格勒工人的和平游行队伍开枪，攻击劳动人民的革命组织，革命的和平时期终结了。布尔什维克党不得不又转入秘密的状态，把自己的领袖弗·伊·列宁隐藏起来以避免来自资产阶级反动派对他的迫害。
    处在秘密状态的列宁一分钟也没有停止他领导党的活动。列宁在秘密状态的最后一个时期——从7月到10月——所写的论文、小册子和给党的中央委员会和一些地方委员会的信共有六十多件。在这些文件里，列宁深刻地分析了国内的政治、经济情况和阶级关系的变化，给予了关于改变斗争策略的指示。
    俄国的无产阶级听到来自极秘密状态中的自己领袖的声音，感觉到了他的坚强的领导。
    7月底在彼得格勒秘密举行的布尔什维克党的第六次代表大会，根据列宁的指示宣布了用武装起义方法反对资产阶级临时政府取得社会主义革命胜利的方针。必须用革命群众的暴力来回答越来越残酷和野蛮的资产阶级反动派的暴力。
    根据列宁的建议，党暂时撤销了“全部政权归苏维埃！”的口号，因为在7月事件以后孟什维克和社会革命党人已经把苏维埃变成临时政府的可怜的附属物，所以现在这个口号在客观上是欺骗人民的。弗·伊·列宁和党认为，在适当的条件下将能够而且必须再把全部政权归苏维埃的问题提出来。而这样一个时期很快地就来到了。
    8月底，工人、士兵和海员们根据布尔什维克中央委员会的号召，一致起来保卫红色彼得格勒，并且粉碎了企图镇压革命和建立自己军事独裁的科尔尼洛夫将军的阴谋。在同科尔尼洛夫分子进行斗争的日子里，党使劳动人民的一切组织，首先是工人、士兵和农民代表苏维埃的一切组织都积极地活动起来。在这样一些条件下，党认为再提出“全部政权归苏维埃！”的口号是必要的，并把这个口号同准备武装起义紧密地联系起来。
    当布尔什维克在彼得格勒和莫斯科这样一些有决定意义的苏维埃中占到大多数席位以后，这一口号具有特别的力量。因此，列宁在10月21日—24日写给党的中央委员会、彼得格勒和莫斯科委员会说，现在布尔什维克能够而且必须战胜加米涅夫、季诺维也夫和托洛茨基等投降分子的抗拒而夺取政权，党展开了准备武装起义的巨大政治的、组织的和军事技术的工作。同时，布尔什维克坚持地准备第二次全俄苏维埃代表大会，指望着在这次代表大会上获得绝大多数。
    在准备同反革命势力进行不可避免的武装搏斗中，布尔什维克党遵循着列宁的英明指示。列宁在理论上和事实上教导我们把起义看作最伟大的艺术。列宁发展了马克思和恩格斯对于这个问题的指示，对于无产阶级人民起义的艺术提出了以下五项重要原则：
    “一、无论何时都不要把起义当作儿戏，在开始起义时就要切实懂得，必须把它进行到底。
    “二、必须在决定的地点，决定的关头，集合很大的优势力量，否则更有准备、更有组织的敌人就会把起义者消灭。
    “三、既然起义已经开始，就必须以最大的决心行动起来并坚决转入进攻。‘防御是武装起义的死路。’
    “四、必须抓住时机，趁敌军还分散的时候，出其不意地袭击他们。
    “五、每天（如果以一个城市来说，可以说每一小时）都必须力求获得胜利，即使是小小的胜利也好，无论如何要保持精神上的优势。”（列宁全集，俄文版，第二十六卷，第一百五十二页）
    列宁根据这些原则拟定了武装起义的具体计划：包围和切断彼得格勒，由舰队、武装起来的工人赤卫队和革命军队同时进攻的办法来占领它。列宁提出了把这三部分主要力量的战斗行动配合起来，使它们一定要占领彼得格勒并且不惜任何损失都要保持住这样一些最重要的据点：电话局、电报局、各火车站和桥梁。起义的工人、兵士和水兵就是根据列宁的计划行动的。
    1917年10月列宁秘密来到彼得格勒和他极其巧妙地选择了开始起义的最恰当的时刻，对于准备和实行武装起义具有巨大的意义。10月24日晚上，列宁从他的秘密住所致布尔什维克党中央委员会委员的信说：“历史不会饶恕那些拖延时刻的革命者，他们本来可以在今天获得胜利（而且一定能在今天胜利），却延到明天去，冒着丧失许多、丧失一切的危险。”（列宁全集，俄文版，第二十六卷，第二百○四页）
    在10月25日（11月7日）的夜里，弗·伊·列宁来到了有名的斯莫尔尼宫，这儿是无产阶级革命的战斗司令部。列宁借助于由共产党中央委员会建立的彼得格勒工兵代表苏维埃军事领导中心直接领导武装起义。布勃诺夫、捷尔任斯基、斯维尔德洛夫、斯大林和乌里茨基都参加了这个中心。
    布尔什维克党所实行的英明的列宁的战略和策略，使俄国的工人阶级能够在1917年10月推翻资产阶级政府。在起义时期举行的第二次全俄苏维埃代表大会宣布把全部政权转到苏维埃的手中。宣言中说道：“代表大会凭靠着绝大多数工人、兵士和农民的意志，凭靠着工人和防军在彼得格勒所实现了的胜利起义，业已把政权掌握到自己手中。”
    从那个时候起已经三十九年了，苏联的劳动人民是自己伟大的多民族国家的唯一的主人，并且在共产党的领导下胜利地建设着共产主义。
