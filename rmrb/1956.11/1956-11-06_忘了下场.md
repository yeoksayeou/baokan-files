Forgot the Ending

    On November 1st, the United Nations General Assembly convened an emergency meeting to discuss the grave situation in the Near East caused by the actions of Israel, Britain, and France in invading Egypt. At this meeting, the British representative, Dixon, actually cited the example of the United States' aggression against Korea in an attempt to prove that the Anglo-French aggression against Egypt was "justified." He said, addressing the United States, that when the Korean War broke out, "a member state of the United Nations immediately dispatched its existing forces to intervene."
    Since this British diplomatic representative dared to defend himself with the United States' act of aggression at a world meeting like the United Nations General Assembly, it can only show that the nature of the Anglo-French action against Egypt today is no different from the United States' aggression against Korea. However, Dixon only remembers how the United States entered the Korean War; he forgot how it exited. Dixon should not only remember how the United States launched the aggression against Korea. More importantly, he should remember the mess the United States made in Korea and its crushing defeat. At the same time, Dixon's words also make people understand even more that the aggression of Britain and France must be resolutely stopped. Otherwise, they will think that there is "precedent" and set fires and plunder everywhere. (Weng)

    忘了下场
    11月1日，联合国大会召开了紧急会议，讨论以色列、英国和法国侵犯埃及的行动在中近东造成的严重局势。在这次会议上，英国代表狄克逊竟援引了美国侵略朝鲜的例子，企图证明英法侵略埃及的行动是“有理由”的。他针对美国说，在朝鲜战争爆发的时候，“联合国的一个会员国就曾经立即出动现有的部队去进行干涉。”
    这位英国外交代表既然敢于在像联合国大会这样的世界性的会议上，以美国的侵略行为来为自己辩护，就只能说明英法今天对埃及的行动在性质上同美国侵略朝鲜没有什么两样。可是，狄克逊只记得美国在朝鲜战争中怎样上场，却忘了它是怎样下场的。狄克逊不应该只记住美国怎样发动侵略朝鲜。更重要的是，他应该记住美国在朝鲜怎样搞得焦头烂额，大败而归。同时，狄克逊的话也使人们更加懂得，必须坚决制止英、法的侵略。否则的话，它们将认为“有例可援”而到处放火打劫。　（翁）
