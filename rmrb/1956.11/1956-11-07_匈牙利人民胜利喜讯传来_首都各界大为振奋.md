The news of the establishment of the Hungarian Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government has greatly inspired the people of the capital. From factories to farms, from classrooms to shops, people read and listened to this good news with satisfaction and relief. Many units held forums and discussions, expressing congratulations to the Hungarian people and respect to the Soviet army.

Workers at the Beijing No. 1 Machine Tool Plant eagerly read newspapers and listened to the radio. They felt that the establishment of the Hungarian Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government and the crushing of the counter-revolutionary restoration conspiracy were very gratifying. After reading the newspaper, workers in various workshops and groups of the Xinhua Printing Factory discussed the situation in Hungary. They believed that the Soviet army's assistance to the Hungarian people was not only in the interest of the Hungarian people, but also in the interest of the entire socialist camp. Qian Yu, a worker in the automatic printing press, said, "The Nagy reactionary government has completely exposed its counter-revolutionary and anti-people face. We cannot allow white terror to rule Hungary again!"

The good news from Hungary also inspired the members of agricultural production cooperatives in the suburbs of the capital. The thirteen production teams of the Huangtugang Agricultural Production Cooperative, led by Yin Weichen, a model worker in Beijing, held current affairs seminars on the Hungarian situation on the evening of the 4th. The members of the Huangtugang Agricultural Cooperative felt particularly close to the word "Hungary." The Hungarian government delegation that visited China the year before last visited this cooperative and presented many gifts. Therefore, the members cared about the pain and joy of the Hungarian people as if they were caring for their own relatives. Li Jihe, secretary of the cooperative's party general branch, spoke angrily about the Nagy counter-revolutionary government's reactionary policy of returning land to landlords. He said: "The revolutionary achievements gained by the Hungarian people through bloody struggle must not be taken away by counter-revolutionaries!" The members of the Red Star Collective Farm also cared about the struggle of their Hungarian brothers. Yu Chaokai, chairman of the farm, said: "The socialist camp has the powerful Soviet Union. The arrogance of the Hungarian counter-revolutionary forces will definitely not last long, just as a rabbit's tail will not grow long!"

The faculty and students of various universities and colleges in the capital have been concerned about the development of the Hungarian situation. When the news of the establishment of the Hungarian Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government reached Tsinghua University, many students immediately held a forum and wrote letters to pay tribute to the Hungarian people and the Soviet army, which helped the Hungarian people crush the Hungarian counter-revolutionary forces. Many professors were also inspired by this good news. Professor Xu Baojiu, who recently returned from the United States, said that the Hungarian counter-revolutionary forces and imperialists rejoiced too early, and the Hungarian people finally crushed the counter-revolutionary restoration conspiracy. Tao Baokai, a professor in the Department of Civil Engineering, said that the Soviet army's assistance to the Hungarian working people in defending their socialist achievements and the people's democratic regime is a brilliant manifestation of great internationalism. The faculty and students of Peking University expressed the same views.

Salespersons at Wangfujing Department Store were full of confidence in the victory of socialism in Hungary. They believed that the Hungarian patriotic people would surely win and must win. At the same time, they also felt from this incident that it was extremely important to distinguish between the enemy and ourselves and to distinguish between right and wrong. Hu Huating, a salesperson in the advanced collective hardware department, said: Imperialists want to use the Hungarian incident to slander the Soviet Union and provoke relations between socialist countries. At this time, we especially need to strengthen the unity of the socialist camp and unite like one person, so as to have more strength to crush our common enemy. Zheng Baorui, a staff member of Wangfujing Xinhua Bookstore, said: The first sentence of the People's Daily editorial on the 5th, "Good news comes," truly expresses our feelings when we saw the news of the improvement of the Hungarian situation in the newspaper. We believe that this favorable change is mainly due to the efforts of the Hungarian working people who are loyal to the socialist cause and the help of the Soviet army. With the help of the Soviet army, everyone felt relieved.

The writer Ai Wu, who had visited Hungary, used the words "very sad, very happy, very grateful" when talking about his feelings about the recent situation in Hungary. The Hungarian mad rioters murdered and set fires, and even the famous Budapest National Art Gallery was burned to the ground, which made him feel very sad. What made him happy was that the Hungarian people finally crushed the conspiracy of counter-revolutionary restoration with the help of the Soviet army, and this just action of the Soviet army was worthy of gratitude from the Hungarian people and the people of all countries in the socialist camp.

Most of the actors in the Chinese Acrobatic Troupe have performed in Hungary. They have been particularly concerned about the situation in Hungary these days, and they were extremely happy to learn of the establishment of the Hungarian Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government. At a symposium, many actors and staff of the Acrobatic Troupe unanimously expressed their support for the Hungarian Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government, hoping that it could quickly consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship and eliminate the forces of counter-revolution. Everyone expressed great respect for the Soviet army's just action of once again helping the Hungarian people to achieve liberation.

    匈牙利人民胜利喜讯传来
    首都各界大为振奋
    本报讯　前天，匈牙利工农革命政府成立的消息传出以后，首都人民大为振奋，从车间到农庄，从课堂到商店，人们都怀着满意而宽慰的心情阅读和收听这个喜讯。许多单位纷纷举行座谈和讨论，大家都表示了对匈牙利人民的祝贺和对苏联军队的敬意。
    北京第一机床厂的工人争先恐后地看报纸、听广播。他们感到，匈牙利工农革命政府的成立和反革命复辟阴谋的被粉碎，是大快人心的事情。新华印刷厂各车间、各小组的工人在读了报纸以后，许多人都座谈了匈牙利的局势。他们认为，苏军对匈牙利人民的援助不但符合匈牙利人民的利益，而且同整个社会主义阵营的利益是一致的。自动印刷机工人钱雨说：“纳吉反动政府已经完全暴露了它的反革命、反人民的面目。我们不能让白色恐怖再来统治匈牙利！”
    匈牙利传来的喜讯也鼓舞了首都郊区各农业生产合作社的社员们。北京市劳动模范殷维臣领导的黄土岗农业生产合作社的十三个生产队，在4日晚上分别举行了关于匈牙利局势的时事座谈会。黄土岗农业社社员们对“匈牙利”这几个字特别感到亲切。前年来中国访问的匈牙利政府代表团曾到这个合作社参观，并且赠送了许多礼物。因此，社员们就像关怀自己的亲人一样关怀着匈牙利人民的痛苦和喜悦。合作社党总支书记李寄和气愤地谈到纳吉反革命政府要将土地归还地主的反动政策。他说：“匈牙利人民经过流血斗争获得的革命成果决不能让反革命分子抢过去！”红星集体农庄的庄员们也同样关怀匈牙利兄弟的斗争。这个农庄的主席于潮凯说：“社会主义阵营里有强大的苏联，匈牙利反革命势力的嚣张绝对不会长久的，就像兔子的尾巴不会长长一样！”
    首都各高等学校的广大师生一直在关心着匈牙利局势的发展。当匈牙利工农革命政府成立的消息传到清华大学的时候，许多学生立刻举行了座谈会，并写信向匈牙利人民和帮助匈牙利人民粉碎匈牙利反革命势力的苏联军队致敬。许多教授也被这个喜讯所振奋。最近从美国回来的许葆玖教授说，匈牙利的反革命势力和帝国主义者高兴得太早了，匈牙利人民终于粉碎了反革命复辟阴谋。土木系教授陶葆楷说，苏军帮助匈牙利劳动人民保卫住自己的社会主义成果和人民民主政权，是伟大的国际主义精神的光辉表现。北京大学的师生们表示了同样的意见。
    王府井百货商店的营业员对社会主义事业在匈牙利的胜利充满了信心。他们认为，匈牙利爱国人民一定胜利而且必须胜利。同时他们还从这次事件中特别感到分清敌我、辨别是非是极端重要的。先进集体五金部营业员胡华亭说：帝国主义者想利用匈牙利事件诬蔑苏联，挑拨社会主义国家之间的关系，在这种时候，我们尤其需要加强社会主义阵营的团结，团结得像一个人一样，以便更有力量去粉碎我们的共同的敌人。王府井新华书店的工作人员郑宝瑞说：人民日报5日社论的第一句话“喜讯传来”，真正表达了我们在报上看到匈牙利局势好转的消息时的心情。我们认为，这个有利的转变主要是靠忠实于社会主义事业的匈牙利劳动人民的努力和苏联军队的帮助。有了苏军的帮助，大家都感到放心了。
    曾经访问过匈牙利的作家艾芜，在谈到他对最近匈牙利局势的感想时，用了“很痛心，很高兴，很感激”这样的字眼。匈牙利丧心病狂的暴乱分子杀人放火，连著名的布达佩斯国立艺术陈列馆也被付之一炬，这是使他深感痛心的。使他高兴的是匈牙利人民终于在苏军援助下粉碎了反革命复辟的阴谋，而苏军的这一正义行动，是值得匈牙利人民和社会主义阵营各国人民感激的。
    中国杂技团的演员们大部分都曾到匈牙利去演出过。他们这几天特别关心匈牙利的情况，在知道匈牙利工农革命政府成立的消息以后，他们极为高兴。在一个座谈会上，杂技团的许多演员和工作人员一致表示对匈牙利工农革命政府的支持，希望它能迅速巩固人民民主专政，肃清反革命的势力。大家对苏联军队又一次帮助匈牙利人民得到解放的正义行动表示极大的敬意。
