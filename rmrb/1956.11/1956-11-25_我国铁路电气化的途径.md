The Path to Railway Electrification in China

The Content and Benefits of Railway Electrification
Railway electrification involves installing power supply equipment along railway lines and operating electric trains. On railway main lines, electric trains are pulled by electric locomotives. Electric locomotives have high horsepower and can pull longer and heavier trains at higher speeds. However, electric trains operating on suburban railways do not use locomotives but consist of several electric multiple units (EMUs). Each EMU includes three or four cars, one or two of which are electric cars. Each electric car is equipped with electric motors underneath, acting like a small electric locomotive. Suburban electric trains have rapid acceleration and operation due to having multiple electric cars.

Electrified railways have overhead contact wires that supply electricity to the electric trains through the pantographs of the electric locomotives or electric cars. The current in the contact wire is supplied by traction substations distributed along the route. These substations are connected to power substations in a unified power system via high-voltage transmission lines, or directly to power plants. Therefore, an electrified railway is powered by the nation's unified power system, like an electrified industrial enterprise.

The primary benefit of railway electrification is the high fuel utilization efficiency of electric traction. Steam locomotive traction efficiency is only 3%-5%, while electric traction can reach 16%-18%. Therefore, switching to electric traction can save two-thirds to three-quarters of the fuel.

Internal combustion locomotive traction also has high efficiency, but it must burn expensive liquid fuel.

Electric traction can also utilize electricity generated by hydropower stations, thus requiring no fuel at all. In this case, its efficiency reaches over 60%, making it the most economical form of traction.

During downhill travel and deceleration or braking, electric trains can regenerate electrical energy and send the current back to the contact wire. Under normal circumstances, the energy saved by regeneration can reach 18%-20% of the train's total energy consumption.

Secondly, since electric locomotives do not have a prime mover on board, they have higher horsepower than other types of locomotives of the same weight. At the same time, their power is not limited by the power of the prime mover, as with other locomotives, and can draw extra power from the contact wire for short periods. For these reasons, electric locomotives can pull more and run faster than other locomotives. Therefore, adopting electric traction can greatly increase the railway's throughput and transport capacity. Generally speaking, compared with steam traction, adopting electric traction can increase railway transport capacity by one to two times or more. In addition, electrified railways require fewer operators, have higher labor productivity, and offer better working conditions.

Besides better completing transportation tasks, railway electrification can also help solve the power supply problems of areas near the railway and promote the development of agricultural electrification along the line.

The Status of Railway Electrification in Various Countries
Electric traction on railway main lines has existed for over fifty years. Currently, the total length of electrified railways in the world is approximately 56,000 kilometers, accounting for about 4% of the total railway length, most of which is concentrated in Western European countries. Countries such as Switzerland, Sweden, the Netherlands, and Italy have a relatively large proportion of electrified railways due to their abundant water resources.

Recently, many countries have decided to significantly expand the length of electrified railways, gradually switching major lines to electric traction, and have launched a high tide of railway transportation technology transformation centered on railway electrification. The United Kingdom's fifteen-year railway modernization plan announced last year decided to stop the production of steam locomotives and initially planned to more than double the length of electrified railways. France plans to extend electrified railways to 6,800 kilometers, enabling electric traction to undertake 50% of the railway's total transport volume. The decision of the CPSU Central Committee on railway electrification in the first half of this year pointed out that 40,000 kilometers of railways in the Soviet Union should be electrified within fifteen years. This figure is equal to 80% of the total length of existing electrified railways in countries other than the Soviet Union. After the completion of this plan, electric traction will undertake 60% of the transport volume of Soviet railways.

The United States has heavily developed internal combustion locomotives in the past decade, and the proportion of electrified railways is very small. However, recently, many people in the United States have proposed that adopting electric traction is more economical than internal combustion traction.

Scientific and Technological Issues of Railway Electrification
The first scientific and technological issue of railway electrification is the issue of current system. Currently, there are three main current systems: direct current (DC), low-frequency single-phase alternating current (AC), and industrial-frequency single-phase AC. Each current system has its own characteristics. The analysis and comparison of various current systems is an extremely complex comprehensive scientific work. The relative advantages of various current systems often change with the development of basic electrical engineering technology. From the current technical conditions, generally speaking, the new industrial-frequency single-phase AC is more economical and has more advantages in other aspects. France, the United Kingdom, Japan, Austria, and other countries have all decided to massively develop this current system. The Soviet Academy of Sciences also strongly advocates adopting this current system as the future direction of railway electrification development.

The central problem of the industrial-frequency single-phase AC system is to create economical, reliable, and superior-performance AC electric locomotives. Currently, industrial-frequency single-phase AC electric locomotives in design, testing, and operation can be mainly divided into four categories: (1) single-phase commutator motor locomotives; (2) rotary converter locomotives; (3) locomotives using AC asynchronous motors; and (4) rectifier locomotives. These locomotives each have their own advantages and disadvantages. The research on AC electric locomotives has opened up a wider path for the research of electric transmission and automation and other disciplines. At the same time, the development of high-speed electric locomotives has placed higher demands on locomotive structure and dynamics research. In addition, there is a need to create high-power semiconductor rectifiers with gate control for application in electric locomotives.

The traction motor is the heart of the electric locomotive. And the main problem of the traction motor is the design of high-power motors. In order to increase the power of the traction motor, it is necessary to study new high-temperature-resistant insulation materials and the theory of ventilation methods. In addition, it is also necessary to improve the commutation state of the traction motor, especially the performance of the single-phase commutator traction motor during starting and low-speed operation.

The adoption of new traction current systems puts new demands on the power supply system. The existing synthesis and analysis methods for AC power supply systems are not accurate enough, and the calculation process is too complicated. It is necessary to derive calculation formulas for the power supply system on a more rigorous theoretical basis and to develop simple engineering calculation methods for field application. At the same time, it is also necessary to solve the problem of interference to communication equipment along the route.

Using concrete structures for contact wire supports is more economical. However, the design and calculation of this type of support have not been well resolved. Another problem of the contact wire is the insulation problem in tunnels and bridges. This problem is even more important due to the adoption of high-voltage AC systems. In addition, it is necessary to create better wear-resistant materials for contact conductors.

Finally, it is necessary to formulate economic design indicators for the new power supply system and to study the economic effects of adopting electric traction in different transport volumes and different regions. More importantly, in coordination with the development of the national overall economy, we should study the development ratio and steps of railway electrification.

The Path to Railway Electrification in China
China's railway electrification should adopt the industrial-frequency single-phase AC system. The experience of railway electrification in various countries shows that adopting this new system is completely correct. With the help of fraternal countries, China has no technical problems in establishing factories and timely supplying AC electric locomotives in the near future. The traction performance of AC electric locomotives is superior to that of DC electric locomotives. More importantly, the total investment in industrial-frequency single-phase AC electrification is one-quarter less than that of the DC system, the operating cost is also lower, and more than 200 tons of copper can be saved per 100 kilometers. The power supply system of the new system is much simpler than the DC system, which can accelerate the construction of railway electrification. The additional investment required for cabling communication lines is generally recovered within three to four years due to the low maintenance costs of the cable. Moreover, communication cables are an advanced equipment that can carry thousands of telephone calls, are reliable in operation, and have a very long service life.

Some people have advocated that some sections of China should temporarily adopt the DC system first. This is not necessary. The combined use of DC and AC systems is very complex technically. For the long-term interests of railway transportation and national defense requirements, we should avoid taking this detour to prevent causing greater difficulties in the future.

The voltage standard for electrified railways should, in principle, be compatible with the existing standard voltages of electrical equipment, such as 20,000 volts and 35,000 volts. In some mountainous sections, lower voltages can be used depending on the situation to overcome the difficulty of headroom in tunnels.

Various types of AC electric locomotives have their own operating characteristics, so they should be studied one by one according to needs and conditions. However, the first batch of self-made locomotives can first choose one or two types with more mature technology, such as rectifier locomotives or asynchronous motor locomotives.

As for the design problem of the new system electrification, we can absorb foreign experience and study and solve it. According to China's situation, concrete structures should be used as much as possible for contact wire supports, and efforts should be made to complete the corresponding research work as soon as possible. Copper can be used for contact conductor materials at present, but good substitutes should be researched.

The design of traction substations can apply China's existing experience. The control can be temporarily considered to be semi-automatic in order to reduce the difficulties in equipment supply in the initial work. China's power industry already has a certain foundation, and the motor manufacturing industry can basically design and manufacture various electrical equipment by itself. In order to rapidly carry out China's railway electrification work, in addition to absorbing foreign experience as much as necessary, we should make full use of the existing design capabilities and design standards of various departments in China, and adopt domestically mass-produced equipment as much as possible.

In addition, research should be conducted as soon as possible on which trunk lines of China's railways should gradually switch to electric traction. According to transportation requirements and resource conditions, determine the dates and order of electrification for each line in order to prepare for various preparatory work in a timely manner. China's water resources are particularly abundant. Large-scale water conservancy hubs such as the Xin'anjiang Hydropower Station and the Sanmenxia Water Conservancy Hub are about to begin construction. The surveying work of the Liujiaxia and the Three Gorges of the Yangtze River is also actively underway. The comprehensive utilization of Heilongjiang has also recently reached an agreement with the Soviet government. The issue of China's railway electrification must be studied in conjunction with the development plan of water resources. The electrification of several important trunk lines such as the Beijing-Hankou and Beijing-Shanhaiguan lines should also be planned as soon as possible.

Railway electrification involves a very wide range of issues. China's current technical strength is insufficient, so special attention should be paid to the use and training of personnel. The organization of various relevant units should not be duplicated, and the links should not be too complicated. This will be conducive to the smooth adoption and promotion of new technologies.

The Development Prospects of Railway Electrification
As mentioned above, electric locomotives can not only use chemical fuels more effectively, but also use hydropower or atomic energy electricity. This feature stipulates that electric locomotives have broader prospects than any other type of locomotive currently available.

Steam locomotives and internal combustion locomotives must burn chemical fuels—coal and petroleum—and the reserves of these chemical fuels are very limited. It is estimated that the world's reserves of fissile materials uranium and thorium are more than twenty times those of chemical fuels coal, petroleum, and natural gas. Moreover, new signs indicate that it is entirely possible for people to control deuterium fusion in the near future, so that the enormous energy of thermonuclear reactions can be used for peaceful purposes. It can be envisioned that when the development of the national economy reaches the point where chemical fuels and water resources can no longer meet the country's further need for power, atomic energy power will gradually become the country's main source of power. It can be expected that after three or four decades, the power system formed by atomic energy power stations and hydropower stations will spread throughout the world, and electric locomotives will be widely used on railway trunk lines. Atomic energy locomotives may be used in some remote areas and become a reliable auxiliary traction form for railway transportation.

    我国铁路电气化的途径
    曹建猷
    铁路电气化的内容和好处
    铁路电气化就是在铁路沿线安装供电设备，在铁路上行驶电气列车。在铁路干线上行驶的电气列车由电力机车牵引。电力机车马力大，所牵引的列车要较长较重，而且速度较高。但近郊铁路上行驶的电气列车不用机车，而是由若干电动车辆组联组成，每组联包括三节或四节车辆，其中有一节或二节是电动车辆。每节电动车辆下面都装有电动机，俨如一台小型电力机车。近郊电气列车由于具有许多电动车辆，因而起动和运行都很迅速。
    电气化铁路沿线上空吊挂着接触网，它通过电力机车或电动车辆的受电弓架将电流供给电气列车。接触网中的电流由沿路分布的牵引变电所供给，这些变电所经由高压输电线接到统一动力系统中的电力变电所，或者直接接到发电厂。因此，电气化铁路系由国家的统一动力系统供电，犹如一个电气化的工业企业。
    铁路电气化的好处首先在于电气牵引的燃料利用效率高。蒸汽机车牵引的效率只有3％—5％，而电气牵引可到16％—18％。因此，改用电气牵引可节省三分之二到四分之三的燃料。
    内燃机车牵引的效率也很高，但是它必须烧用贵重的液体燃料。
    电气牵引还可利用水电站发出的电力，因而可以完全不需要燃料。这时它的效率达到60％以上，成为最经济的一种牵引形式。
    在下坡和减速或停车时，电气列车可以再生电能，将电流送回接触网。在一般情况下，再生所节约的电能可以达到列车全部电能消耗量的18％—20％。
    其次，电力机车由于车上没有原动机，因此它比同样重量的其他型式的机车马力要大。同时，它的功率不像其他机车那样受原动机功率的限制，而可以短时由接触网取用超额的电力。由于这些缘故，电力机车要比其他机车拉得多，跑得快，因而采用电气牵引可以大大地提高铁路的通过能力和运输能力。一般说来，和蒸汽牵引比较，采用电气牵引可以提高铁路运输能力一倍到二倍以上。此外，电气化铁路所需操作人员较少，劳动生产率较高，劳动条件也好。
    铁路电气化除能更好地完成运输任务外，还可以帮助解决铁路邻近地区的电力供应问题和促进沿线农业电气化的发展。
    世界各国铁路电气化的情况
    在铁路干线上采用电气牵引到现在已有五十多年的历史。目前世界各国已有电气化铁路的总长度约为五万六千公里，约占铁路总长度的4％，其中大部分集中在西欧国家。瑞士、瑞典、荷兰、意大利等国由于水力资源较为丰富，电气化铁路所占比例也较大。
    最近许多国家决定要大量扩展电气化铁路的长度、使主要线路逐步改用电气牵引，并掀起了以铁路电气化为中心的铁路运输技术改造的高潮。英国去年宣布的十五年铁路现代化计划，决定要停止蒸汽机车的生产，并在初期计划中规定增加电气化铁路一倍以上。法国计划要使电气化铁路延长到六千八百公里，使电气牵引担负铁路总运量的50％。今年上半年苏共中央关于铁路电气化的决定指出，要在十五年内使苏联四万公里的铁路电气化。这个数字等于苏联以外各国现有电气化铁路总长的80％。在这个计划完成后，电气牵引将担负苏联铁路60％的运量。
    美国近十年来大量发展内燃机车，电气化铁路所占比重很小。但是近来美国已有不少人士提出，采用电气牵引要比内燃牵引为经济。
    铁路电气化的科学技术问题
    铁路电气化的科学技术问题，首先是电流制的问题。目前主要存在三种电流制：直流制、低频率单相交流制和工业频率单相交流制。三种电流制各有其特点。对于各种电流制的分析和比较，是一个极为复杂的综合性科学工作。各个电流制的相对优越性，往往又随着电工基本技术的发展而有所改变。从目前的技术条件来看，一般说来，新的工业频率单相交流制要比较经济，其他方面的优点也较多。法国、英国、日本、奥地利等国都已决定要大量发展这种电流制。苏联科学院也极力主张采用这种电流制作为今后铁路电气化的发展方向。
    工业频率单相交流制的中心问题，是创造经济、可靠而性能优越的交流电力机车。现在在设计、试验和运用中的工业频率单相交流电力机车，主要可分为四类：（1）单相整流子电动机机车；（2）旋转变流机式机车；（3）采用交流异步电动机的机车；（4）整流器机车。这些机车也各互有其优缺点。交流电力机车的研究给电力传动和自动化等学科的研究打开了更为广阔的门路。同时，高速电力机车的发展，对于机车构造及动力学的研究工作，提出了更高的要求。此外，还有待创造具有栅极控制的半导体强力整流器以应用于电力机车。
    牵引电动机是电力机车的心脏。而牵引电动机的主要问题，是大功率电动机的设计。为了提高牵引电动机的功率，必需研究能耐高温的新绝缘材料和通风方式的理论。此外，还需要改进牵引电动机的整流状态，特别是单相整流子牵引电动机在起动和低速运转时的性能。
    新的牵引电流制的采用，对供电系统提出了新的要求。现有的交流制供电系统的综合法和分析法还不够准确，计算过程也过于复杂。必需在较严格的理论基础上求出供电系统的计算公式，并做出简便的工程计算方法以备现场应用。同时，还必需解决对沿路通讯设备的干扰问题。
    接触网支柱采用混凝土结构要比较经济。但是这种支柱的设计和计算还没有很好解决。接触网的另一问题是隧道和桥梁内的绝缘问题。这个问题由于采用高压交流制而显得更为重要。此外，尚须为接触导线创造较好的耐磨材料。
    最后，需要为新制供电系统拟定经济设计指标，并研究在不同运量和不同地区采用电气牵引的经济效果。更重要的是，配合国家总体经济的发展，研究铁路电气化的发展比例和步骤。
    我国铁路电气化的途径
    我国铁路电气化应采用工业频率单相交流制。各国铁路电气化的经验表明，采用这种新制是完全正确的。有兄弟国家的帮助，我国在最近建立工厂并及时供应交流电力机车，在技术上已无问题。交流电力机车的牵引性能，要比直流电力机车为优越。更重要的是，工业频率单相交流电气化的总投资要比直流制少四分之一，运用费也较低，而且每一百公里可以节省铜二百吨以上。新制的供电系统比直流制简单得多，因而可以加速铁路电气化的建设。通讯线路电缆化所需要的额外投资，由于电缆维护费很低，一般在三年到四年内就可收回。况且通讯电缆是一种先进设备，它可以通过数以千计的电话，运用可靠，使用期限极长。
    曾有人主张我国某些区段暂先采用直流制。这是没有必要的。直流制和交流制并用，在技术上是非常复杂的。为了铁路运输的长远利益和国防上的要求，我们应避免走这条弯路，防止造成以后更大的困难。
    电气化铁路的电压标准，原则上最好同电力设备的已有标准电压相适应，例如二万伏和三万五千伏。在某些多山区段，根据情况，可以采用较低电压，以克服隧道内的净空的困难。
  各种类型的交流电力机车都有其运用特点，因而应根据需要与条件一一加以研究。但第一批自制的机车可先选择一两种技术上比较成熟的类型，例如整流器机车或异步电动机机车。
    至于新制电气化设计问题，可吸取国外经验加以研究解决。根据我国情况，接触网支柱应尽量采用混凝土结构，并争取尽早完成相应的研究工作。接触导线材料目前可以用铜，但应该研究出好的代用品。
    牵引变电所的设计可以应用我国已有的经验。控制可以暂时考虑采用半自动，以便减少初期工作中设备的供应上的困难。我国电力工业已有一定基础，电机制造业也已基本上能自行设计和制造各种电力设备。为了我国铁路电气化工作能迅速开展，除必要尽量吸收国外经验外，应充分利用我国各部门已有的设计能力和设计标准，并尽可能采用国内已成批生产的设备。
    此外，对于我国铁路哪些干线应逐步改用电气牵引，应及早进行研究。根据运输的要求和资源条件，确定各个线路进行电气化的日期和次序，以便及时作好各项准备工作。我国水力资源特别丰富，大型水利枢纽如新安江水电站、三门峡水利枢纽等即将开始建设。刘家峡和长江三峡的勘测工作也在积极进行。黑龙江的综合利用问题，最近也已和苏联政府达成协议。我国铁路电气化问题，必须和水力资源的开发计划同时研究。若干重要干线如京汉、京山等线路的电气化，也应该及早筹划。
    铁路电气化牵涉的问题十分广泛。我国目前技术力量不足，因此应该特别注意人员的使用和培养，各有关单位的组织不宜重复，环节不可过于复杂，这样才有利于新技术的顺利采用和推广。
    铁路电气化的发展远景
    如上所述，电力机车不但可以更有效地利用化学燃料，而且可以利用水力发电或原子能电力。这一特点，就规定了电力机车比现有的任何其他种类的机车前途更为广阔。
    蒸汽机车和内燃机车都必须烧用化学燃料——煤和石油，而这些化学燃料的蕴藏量是很有限的。据估计，世界分裂物质铀和钍的藏量为化学燃料煤、石油和天然气的二十倍以上。而且新的迹象表明，人们完全有可能在不久的将来对重氢聚变加以控制，以便能量巨大的热核子反应可用于和平的目的。可以设想，当国民经济发展到化学燃料和水力资源已不能满足国家对动力的进一步需要的时候，原子能动力将逐渐成为国家主要的动力来源。可以预期，经过三、四十年之后，由原子能电站和水电站所结成的电力系统将遍及世界，铁路干线将普遍采用电力机车。原子能机车有可能在某些偏僻地区采用，成为铁路运输一种可靠的辅助牵引形式。
