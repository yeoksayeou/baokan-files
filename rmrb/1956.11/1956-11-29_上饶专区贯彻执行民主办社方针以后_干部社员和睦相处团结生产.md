    Following the implementation of the democratic management of cooperatives policy in Shangrao Prefecture, Jiangxi Province, a new atmosphere of harmony, democracy, and unity in production has emerged among rural cadres and cooperative members.

    Starting in September, the various counties in Shangrao Prefecture rectified the work style of rural cadres using criticism and self-criticism in two phases. During the rectification study, all cadres examined the situation of implementing the mass line, criticized shortcomings in this area, and selected and commended a large number of model cadres. Based on the rectification of cadres' ideological work style, Party organizations at all levels in the prefecture, led by the county party secretary or township general branch secretary, organized visiting groups and visiting teams to go deep into the agricultural cooperatives to visit cooperative members. Then, they universally convened member representative conferences or member conferences to further promote democracy and fully carry out bottom-up criticism.

    At the member representative conferences or member conferences held in various places, many members, in a spirit of goodwill towards others, criticized certain cadres' coercive orders and their work style of not caring about the hardships of the cooperative members. After members of the Wuqiao Township agricultural cooperative in Yujiang County criticized cadres for forcing members to remove taro from their private plots, the cadres immediately made sincere self-criticism. Many cadres in Dongxiang, Poyang, and other counties also self-criticized at the meetings for their mistaken behavior of treating cooperative members by deducting work points.

    Subsequently, the broad masses of cooperative members conducted in-depth inspections of the production and construction and operational management of their cooperatives, and put forward opinions and criticisms. Members of the Huxi agricultural cooperative in Shangrao County put forward a total of 241 criticisms and suggestions. Among them, 25 new sideline production avenues were found for the entire cooperative, which could increase the income of cooperative members by more than 187,000 yuan in the fourth quarter. The production plan and contracted production quotas of the Huoxing agricultural cooperative in Leping County were originally too high, which affected the enthusiasm of the cooperative members. This time, they were reasonably revised based on the opinions put forward by the cooperative members.

    After holding member representative conferences or member conferences, many cadres significantly improved their understanding of promoting democracy and relying on the masses to run the cooperatives. In order to implement the spirit of "democratic management of cooperatives," the management committee of the Huoxing agricultural cooperative in Leping County decided to hold a management committee meeting every half month and a member conference every month to study and report on cooperative affairs. Major matters related to the cooperative must be discussed with the majority of cooperative members. In addition, some agricultural cooperatives have also established cooperative member inquiry offices and cooperative member suggestion boxes to promptly understand and handle cooperative members' opinions.

    At the same time, many cooperative member representatives also reviewed their shortcomings of having a weak concept of loving the cooperative at the meetings. Some cooperative members said: "In the past, I was physically in the cooperative, but my heart was outside the cooperative; now I am truly the masters of my own affairs, and I must work with the cadres to run the cooperative well in the future."

    Since the beginning of winter, rural sideline production in the prefecture has been more active than in any previous period. In Yujiang County, four townships increased the number of pigs raised by 753 within ten days. In the Liaoyuan cooperative in Guangfeng Township, the average sideline income of each cooperative member household reached more than 20 yuan in the past month.

### 上饶专区贯彻执行民主办社方针以后  干部社员和睦相处团结生产

    上饶专区贯彻执行民主办社方针以后
    干部社员和睦相处团结生产
    本报讯　江西省上饶专区农村干部和社员中间，呈现出一种和睦、民主、团结生产的新气象。
    自9月份开始，上饶专区各县对农村干部的作风，采取批评和自我批评的方法，分两批进行了整顿。在整风学习中，全体干部检查了执行群众路线的情形，批判了在这方面的缺点，并且评选和表扬了大批模范干部。在整顿干部思想作风的基础上，全区各级党组织都以县委书记或乡总支书记为首组织了访问团和访问小组，深入农业社对社员进行了访问，然后普遍召开了社员代表大会或社员大会，进一步发扬了民主，充分地开展了自下而上的批评。
    在各地召开的社员代表会或社员大会上，许多社员都本着与人为善的态度，对某些干部的强迫命令、不关心社员群众疾苦的作风提出了批评。余江县坞桥乡农业社社员，批评干部强迫社员拔掉自留地上的芋头等错误以后，干部立即作了诚恳的检讨。东乡、鄱阳等县不少干部还在会上检讨了自己用扣罚工分来对待社员的错误行为。
    接着，广大社员对自己社里的生产建设、经营管理情况，进行了深入的检查，提出了意见和批评。上饶县湖西农业社社员共提出了二百四十一条批评和建议。其中为全社新找出的副业门路就有二十五项，可在第四季度为社员增加十八万七千多元的收入。乐平县火星农业社的生产计划和包工包产的指标原来都偏高，影响了社员的积极性。这次根据社员提出的意见作了合理的修正。
    开了社员代表大会或社员大会以后，许多干部对发扬民主、依靠群众办社的思想显著地提高了。乐平县火星农业社管理委员会为了贯彻“民主办社”的精神，决定每半月召开一次管理委员会议，每月召开一次社员大会，研究和报告社务工作。有关社内的重大事情，都必须和多数社员商量。此外，有些农业社还设立了社员问事处和社员意见箱，以便及时了解和处理社员的意见。
    与此同时，许多社员代表在会上也检讨了自己爱社观念薄弱的缺点。有的社员说：“过去我是人在社内，心在社外；现在真是当家作主了，今后一定要同干部一起把社办好。”
    入冬以来，全区农村副业生产比以往任何一个时期都活跃。余江县有四个乡在十天之内就增养了生猪七百五十三头。广丰乡燎原社在最近一个月之内，平均每户社员的副业收入达到二十元以上。
