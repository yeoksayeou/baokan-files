Comrades, ladies and gentlemen, brothers and sisters:

In the 1950s, under the bright sunlight, before the eyes of billions of people around the world, we witnessed unbelievable events, heinous events, events of murder, arson, robbery, looting, and blatant aggression. Who committed these events? It was those who call themselves people of advanced civilized nations, those who call themselves gentlemen, those who call themselves the free world – the British and French imperialists.

They openly launched armed aggression against Egypt!

These people – calling them people is actually too flattering, too polite. To call them by their true names – robbers, demons – that is the unvarnished truth!

Recalling a few historical events that are still fresh in my memory can further prove their so-called civilization and freedom. More than a century ago, the British imperialists poisoned the Chinese people with opium, forcing them to buy it. When the Chinese people refused to buy it, they sent warships to attack China, occupy our territory, and demand compensation for their military expenses, signing many unequal treaties. This is what people of a civilized nation, people of the free world, did – civilized things. Twenty years ago, I went to Vietnam and heard that the French imperialists were ruling there at the time. Ten families were only allowed to share one knife, and travel between villages and towns required a pass. If a family had a woman, they were not allowed to close their doors at night, allowing these so-called civilized people to freely enter and leave, raping women. This is what the people of the advanced civilized French free world did. Now, the French imperialists in Algeria, Africa, and the British imperialists in Kenya are still engaged in the shameful acts of looting, burning, and killing the local people. This is the behavior of those so-called civilized, advanced nations of the free world, this is the civilization and freedom they cherish.

Their accustomed civilization and freedom of engaging in robbery, invasion, murder, arson, oppression, and exploitation is what they call vested interests. Egypt has become independent, and they are no longer allowed to invade, murder, set fires, oppress, and exploit, so they are uncomfortable and say their interests are being "violated."

But in the 1950s, the people of the world have awakened, knowing that they must demand national liberation, demanding anti-colonialism, and most have already gained independence and liberation. Can we still allow such robbers and demons to run rampant? "Rats running across the street, everyone shouts 'kill them!'" Not to mention their rampant tyranny, which further endangers world peace and violates human dignity.

We, the Chinese people, are a people who have suffered the painful experience of imperialist aggression, a people who have stood up, a revolutionary people, a people who uphold justice. We believe that our government will use all possible and effective means to support Egypt. What should our people do about this? I believe that we should do everything possible and effective to fully support the just struggle of the Egyptian people, until the Egyptian people achieve victory, and never give up until we reach our goal.

### 中国国民党革命委员会主席  李济深的讲话

    中国国民党革命委员会主席
    李济深的讲话
    同志们、先生们、女士们、兄弟姐妹们：
    我们在二十世纪五十年代，在光天化日之下，在全世界亿万人的目光睽睽之下，看到令人不能相信的事件、万恶的大事件、杀人放火打劫掠夺的事件、公然侵略的事件。这事件是什么人做的呵？就是那号称先进文明国家的人们、号称绅士君子的人们、号称自由世界的人们——英法帝国主义者所做的。
    他们公然武装侵略埃及！
    这些人们，称他做人们其实是太恭维了，太客气了，名副其实的、称他做强盗、称他做恶魔，那才是不折不扣的事实！
    我回忆一点历史上犹新的事件，就更可以证明他们的所谓文明自由了。英帝国主义者在一百余年前将鸦片烟毒害中国人民，将鸦片烟强卖给中国人民。中国人民不买他的，他就开兵船向中国进攻，占领我们的国土，还赔偿他们军费，订了不少不平等条约。这是文明的国家人们做的、自由世界人们做的文明事。我前二十年到过越南，听说法帝国主义当时在那里统治，十家只许共用一把刀，村乡往来要通行证，人家有妇女的夜不许闭门，任他们所谓文明人随意出入，奸淫妇女，这就是先进文明的法国自由世界的人们做的事。现在法帝国主义在非洲阿尔及利亚、英帝国主义在怯尼亚还在做劫掠焚杀当地人民的可耻的勾当。这就是他们所谓文明先进国家自由世界人们的行状，这就是他们所爱的文明自由。
    他们行使劫掠侵夺、杀人放火、欺压剥削的文明自由惯了谓之既得利益。埃及独立了，不许他们侵略杀人放火、欺压剥削，他们就不舒服了，说“侵犯”他的利益了。
    但是在二十世纪五十年代，世界上人们省觉了，知道要求民族解放了，要求反殖民主义了，而且多数得到独立解放了，还能再容许这样强盗恶魔横行吗！“老鼠过街，人人喊打”，何况他们横行霸道更危害世界和平，侵犯了人类的尊严。
    我们中国人民是受过帝国主义侵略惨痛的人民，是站立起来了的人民，是革命的人民，是主持正义的人民，我们相信我们政府一定会用尽可能而又有效的办法支持埃及。我们人民对这件事应该怎么做呢？我以为应该想尽一切可能而又有效的办法，来全力支持埃及人民正义的斗争，一直到埃及人民得到胜利为止，不达目的，决不罢休。
