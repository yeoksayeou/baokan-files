    The 15th Anniversary of the Founding of the Albanian Labor Party
    —Written for "People's Daily"—
    Muhammed Shehu, Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of Albania
    Editor's Note: November 8th of this year marks the 15th anniversary of the founding of the Albanian Labor Party. We received Comrade Shehu's article late and are publishing it here now.
    The Albanian Labor Party is one of the youngest Marxist-Leninist parties in Europe. It was founded on November 8, 1941, and today marks its 15th anniversary. It currently has more than 49,000 members and candidate members.
    The Albanian Labor Party is the leading, organizing, and inspiring force of the Albanian people, the vanguard of the working class, and the embodiment of the vital interests of the people. In the fifteen years since its founding and revolutionary activities, it has led the Albanian people in armed struggles against foreign aggressors and the domestic ruling classes who served the occupiers, and established the people's regime. Unlike other political parties, the Albanian Labor Party has led the people to successfully complete the bourgeois democratic revolution and is now victoriously leading the Albanian people in carrying out a magnificent socialist revolution by peaceful means.
    The Albanian Communist Party (now the Albanian Labor Party) was founded during the Second World War and under foreign occupation. At that time, Albania had become a province of Fascist Italy and was an economically backward semi-feudal and semi-capitalist country. The working class was in the initial stages of formation, and there were no other progressive political parties.
    The fifteen years of life and revolutionary activity of the Albanian Labor Party are the most glorious milestone in the history of the Albanian people. For freedom and independence, the Albanian people have continuously carried out heroic armed struggles against foreign occupiers in their mountainous homeland for hundreds of years. They never succumbed, and they defended their language, their customs, and their way of life. The long struggle of the Albanian people for freedom and independence only achieved victory on November 29, 1944, under the leadership of the Albanian Communist Party. At that time, Albania was liberated from foreign oppression and became a free and independent country, and the people took control of their own destiny.
    Real life proves that, on the whole, our party's general line has always been correct. Within our party, individual members or groups have had many anti-party, opportunist, Trotskyist, and revisionist manifestations, but none of them have been able to divert the party from the correct general line. Our party has overcome these harmful manifestations in the struggle against them.
    The decisive factor in the Albanian Labor Party's establishment of a correct Marxist-Leninist line and consistent maintenance of the purity of the party ranks is that, from its founding to the present, it has firmly relied on the experience of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and creatively applied it in Albania. Our party believes that the experience of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet state is the best example of creatively applying Marxism-Leninism in building the party and building a socialist state.
    On April 7, 1939, Fascist Italian troops landed on the Albanian coast. The head of the monarchical system at that time surrendered to the occupiers. The King betrayed the motherland and fled abroad. However, the people spontaneously met the invaders with fighting in the absence of any political party leadership. However, the Italian army suppressed the people's resistance, occupied the entire Albania in a few days, and turned it into a province of Italy.
    The Fascist Italian occupation of Albania showed the direct and obvious political division of the various classes in Albania: workers, laboring peasants, patriotic intellectuals, the petty bourgeoisie, and the middle class hated the occupiers and cursed the semi-feudal and semi-capitalist system of the former King Zogu, which paved the way for foreign occupation. They were willing to fight for the freedom and independence of their motherland; feudal lords, landlords, rich peasants, wealthy industrial and commercial capitalists, and most officers in the army united with the occupiers, zealously served them, and opposed the people.
    At that time, there were no political parties in Albania, only an Albanian Fascist party established by the Italians. Under the influence of the Great October Socialist Revolution and Marxist-Leninist ideas, some people and groups sympathetic to communism emerged among college students and workers. When Albania was occupied by Fascist Italy, communist groups strengthened their activities; but they were not unified, and they lacked a clear political and organizational line. They were fighting each other. After great efforts, three communist groups merged and established the Albanian Communist Party. Comrade Enver Hoxha played a major role in the establishment of the Albanian Communist Party. From the earliest days of the party's founding until now, he has led the work of the Central Committee and correctly guided it to work along the path of Marxism-Leninism.
    The Albanian Communist Party was founded after the Soviet Union had already joined the Second World War against Nazi Germany. The heroic struggle of the Soviet army against the Hitler bandits opened up the path for the Albanian people to liberate themselves from foreign oppression. This struggle was also an important factor in awakening Albanian communists to establish a communist party and organize a national liberation struggle.
    From the day of its birth, the Albanian Communist Party called on the Albanian people to organize an armed uprising to liberate the motherland from foreign oppression. The party called on all patriotic forces in the country, regardless of class, political views, beliefs, or origin, to unite around the National Liberation Front. In order to liberate the motherland, the party was also determined to cooperate with feudal lords or the bourgeoisie to fight against the occupiers. Due to the correct policy of the Albanian Communist Party, the National Liberation Front, which included the broadest strata, was organized only one year after the party was founded.
    Since the establishment of the National Liberation Front, the political division of the various classes in the country has become increasingly obvious and rapid. The wealthiest part of the bourgeoisie, landlords, and most rich peasants continued to cooperate with the aggressors and, together with them, armed themselves against the people and against the National Liberation Front. Our party organized combat teams and guerrilla teams to begin openly attacking the enemy's troops. The ruling class, which stood with the enemy, established reactionary organizations "Bali Kombetar" and "Legaliteti" out of fear of the growing scale of the national liberation struggle. Our party tried its best to get these organizations to change their policies and merge into the National Liberation Front, but it did not succeed. By mid-1943, these hostile organizations, representing feudal remnants, the reactionary bourgeoisie, and the interests of the enemy, actually established a united front with the invading army and took up arms against the National Liberation Front and the people's army. In this way, the Albanian people's national liberation struggle organized by the Albanian Communist Party had a dual nature from the beginning: initially, the Albanian people's national liberation struggle only had the nature of fighting against foreign aggressors, but now it also had the nature of class struggle, opposing the feudal lords and reactionary bourgeoisie who served the enemy. Thus, the goals of the national liberation struggle became two: to liberate the motherland from the oppression of foreign occupiers, and at the same time to overthrow the regime of landlords and the reactionary bourgeoisie who openly cooperated with the enemy, and to establish a people's regime.
    The brilliant victory of the Soviet army in defeating the Hitler army greatly promoted the development of our country's national liberation struggle. The party put its greatest efforts into mobilizing the people to organize guerrilla teams and the National Liberation Army. All the Albanian people participated in the armed national liberation struggle: nearly 10% of the people participated in the National Liberation Army in the second half of 1944. The party educated the National Liberation Army with the spirit of loving the people and being loyal to proletarian internationalism, and correctly led it to launch a struggle against the Italian and German occupiers and domestic traitors throughout Albania. Even during the national liberation struggle, the party organized the core of the people's regime: it organized committees at the village, district, and provincial levels, and established the National Anti-Fascist Liberation Council, whose executive body was the Anti-Fascist Committee, which performed the duties of a provisional government. On November 29, 1944, Albania was completely liberated, the regime of landlords and the bourgeoisie was completely destroyed, and a people's regime was established. Two divisions of the Albanian National Liberation Army, under the instructions of the party, pursued the Hitler divisions and, at the request of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia, entered the Yugoslav border to assist the Yugoslav National Liberation Army in fighting the Hitler army. Our divisions and the Yugoslav divisions fought side by side in the regions of Kosovo and Metohija, Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina in Yugoslavia, and continued to fight the Hitler bandits.
    After the complete liberation of Albania, a regime of the working masses was established on the ruins of the old ruling class regime. Our party did not distribute power to other political parties, because it was the only party that defended the interests of the people and was able to unite all residents around itself, united in the National Liberation Front; and those political organizations that sided with the occupiers from their inception were eliminated long before the eve of Albania's national liberation.
    With the liberation of the whole country, the party began to implement its program for the economic, political, and social transformation of the country. The party's urgent task was to complete the bourgeois democratic revolution and, at the same time, develop the bourgeois democratic revolution into a socialist revolution by peaceful means. Confiscating the property of foreign capitalist enterprises, confiscating the property of landlords and capitalists who actively opposed the people along with the occupiers, implementing land reform, nationalizing industry, banking, finance, transportation, forests, and water resources, and abolishing national debt—all these measures and reforms were mainly completed in 1946. At the same time, all this was almost concurrent. Therefore, although we had already transitioned to the socialist revolution in 1947, all the initial measures related to the transition to socialism were intertwined with some of the measures in the final stage of the bourgeois democratic revolution completed in 1946. This is the characteristic of our revolution.
    The losses brought by the war to the people were enormous, with the number of deaths and injuries accounting for 7.3% of the country's population, 21% of farmers' houses were burned or destroyed, all bridges, ports, and factories were destroyed, more than one-third of the livestock were killed, and the national economy was destroyed. The national economy destroyed by the war was not fully restored until 1948.
    With the generous and comprehensive assistance of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, the People's Republic of Albania has achieved great victories in building the foundation of socialism. In general, we successfully completed the first five-year plan, which transformed Albania from a backward agricultural country into an industrial-agricultural country. The Third Congress of the Albanian Labor Party, held in May this year, summarized the completion of the first five-year plan and approved the instructions for the second five-year plan for the development of the national economy and culture. 1956 is the first year of the second five-year plan.
    In the years of the first five-year plan, we established a young industry—socialist industry. It plays a leading role in the entire national economy and is a reliable foundation for the future development of various sectors of the national economy. In 1955, the total industrial output was almost eleven times more than in 1938. In terms of the total value of industrial products, what was produced in the whole year of 1938 now only takes thirty-five days at most.
    Compared with 1938, oil production in 1955 reached about 523%, coal mining increased more than fifty-two times, chromium ore mining increased more than sixteen times, the electrical industry increased 978%, the building materials industry increased 528%, the timber industry increased more than ninety-three times, light industry increased more than twenty-five times, and the food industry increased 440%. New industrial sectors were also established during the first five-year plan, such as the machinery industry and the copper smelting industry. Almost 89% of handicrafts have been cooperativized.
    Although we were not able to get agriculture out of its backward state during the first five-year plan, the achievements made in agricultural development are great compared to the past. During the first five-year plan, the total agricultural output increased by 37%, the sown area increased by 13%, wheat harvest increased by 6%, corn increased by 62%, rice increased by 58%, cotton increased by 47%, sugar beets increased by 339%, tobacco increased by 113%, and vegetables increased by 28%, etc.
    At its plenary session last December, the Party Central Committee made a resolution on accelerating the pace of agricultural collectivization. Now agricultural collectivization is rapidly continuing to develop in accordance with the principles of voluntariness and persuasion work for poor and middle peasants. If the socialist component in agriculture accounted for 8% of the sown area in 1950, then this number is now 39%. The main form of agricultural collectivization is the agricultural cooperative. It is formed according to the form of Soviet collective farms combined with our specific conditions. In addition, there are two lower forms.
    Due to the development of industrial and agricultural production, the living standards of the working masses have improved. The total turnover of socialist commercial goods in 1955 was 105% more than in 1950. During the first five-year plan period, the national income increased by nearly 70%, the real wages of workers and staff increased by nearly 20%, and the income of farmers increased by about 30%.
    Before liberation, more than 80% of the residents were illiterate, but now there are no illiterates among people under the age of forty. Currently, 217,000 people, or 15% of the country's population, are studying in primary schools, seven-year schools, middle schools, universities, and night schools.
    If the natural increase rate of the population per thousand people was 16.9 in 1938, then this number reached 29 in 1955.
    The Third Party Congress proposed that the main task of the second five-year plan is to continue to develop industry, especially the mining industry, mainly by fully utilizing production capacity and internal potential; at the same time, it is also necessary to accelerate the development of agriculture, mainly by transforming agriculture according to socialist principles; and on the basis of the above measures, further improve the material conditions of the Albanian people and improve the people's cultural level.
    The foreign policy of the People's Republic of Albania, formulated by the Labor Party, has always been a policy of peace. The unbreakable friendship with the great Soviet Union, the great People's China, and other people's democratic countries is the main principle and cornerstone of our country's foreign policy. Our party educates the people to love and be infinitely loyal to the Soviet Union, because our party believes that the Soviet Union is the decisive factor in our country's liberation, the strong and powerful defender of the interests of the people, peace, and socialism, and the best example of building socialism and communism.
    Our party is loyal to Marxism-Leninism, closely connected with the masses of the people, the correct Marxist-Leninist general line, the glorious patriotic spirit of our people, and the comprehensive assistance of the Soviet Union and other countries in the socialist camp are the source of the historical victories and great achievements of our party and our people.
    The Albanian Labor Party and all the Albanian people infinitely love the glorious Chinese Communist Party and the great Chinese people. Our party and our people closely follow the vigorous development of the great People's China and are infinitely happy for the great achievements made by the great Chinese people in all aspects under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. Our party and our people pay close attention to the Eighth National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party. At its recent plenary session, the Central Committee of our party listened to and approved the report of Enver Hoxha, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Party, on the Eighth National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, who led our delegation to attend the Eighth National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party. Our party believes that the Eighth National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party is of great historical significance not only for the Chinese Communist Party, but also for the entire international workers' movement. We need to learn more from the rich experience of the Chinese Communist Party.
    The Albanian Labor Party is celebrating its 15th anniversary under the circumstances that socialism has gone beyond the scope of one country and has become a world system and the forces of peace are constantly growing. When commemorating this anniversary, the members of the Albanian Labor Party and all the Albanian people have a strong belief in the bright future of building socialism and communism in Albania, and a strong belief in the powerful socialist camp headed by the glorious Soviet state. The Soviet state was the first in the world to build socialism and is now moving forward to building communism with firm steps.
    Our party and our people deeply appreciate the great People's China's comprehensive assistance to our country in building a new life and socialism. Our party and our people will cherish the friendship between the Albanian people and the great Chinese people like the apple of our eye and will continue to consolidate it. The people of our two countries are walking on a common path in building socialism and defending peace.

    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党成立十五周年
    ——为“人民日报”而作——
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央政治局委员
    阿尔巴尼亚部长会议主席  穆罕默德·谢胡
    编者按　今年11月8日是阿尔巴尼亚劳动党成立十五周年纪念日。我们收到谢胡同志的文章较迟，现在发表在这里。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党是欧洲马克思列宁主义政党中最年轻的一个。它是在1941年11月8日成立的，今天是它成立的十五周年纪念日。它现在拥有四万九千多名党员和候补党员。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党是阿尔巴尼亚人民的领导、组织和鼓舞的力量，是工人阶级的先锋队和人民切身利益的体现者。在成立和进行革命活动以来的十五年中，它领导阿尔巴尼亚人民进行了反对外国侵略者和为占领者服务的国内统治阶级的武装斗争，建立了人民政权。阿尔巴尼亚劳动党不同于其他政党，它领导人民胜利地完成了资产阶级民主革命，现在正在胜利地领导阿尔巴尼亚人民用和平的方式进行着宏伟的社会主义革命。
    阿尔巴尼亚共产党（即现在的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党）是在第二次世界大战期间和外国占领的情况下成立的。当时阿尔巴尼亚已经变成了法西斯意大利的一个省，是经济上非常落后的半封建半资本主义的国家，工人阶级处在刚刚开始形成的阶段，也没有其它进步的政党。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党十五年的生活和革命活动是阿尔巴尼亚人民历史上最光辉的标志。为了自由和独立，阿尔巴尼亚人民几百年来在自己多山的国土上不断地进行了英雄的武装斗争，反对外国占领者。他们从不屈服，他们捍卫了自己的语言、自己的习惯和自己的生活。阿尔巴尼亚人民争取自由和独立的长期斗争，只是在阿尔巴尼亚共产党的领导下，在1944年11月29日才取得了胜利。当时，阿尔巴尼亚从外国压迫下解放出来，变成了自由和自主的国家，人民掌握了自己的命运。
    现实生活证明：总的说来，我党的总路线一贯是正确的。在我党的队伍里，个别分子或集团有过许多反党的、机会主义的、托洛茨基的和修正主义的表现，但他们都没有能使党离开正确的总路线。我党在同这些有害的表现斗争时战胜了它们。
    我党确立马克思列宁主义的正确路线并一贯保持党的队伍的纯洁的决定性因素，是由于我党从成立到现在一直都牢固地依靠苏联共产党的经验，并且创造性地在阿尔巴尼亚加以运用。我党认为，苏联共产党和苏维埃国家的经验，是在建设党和建设社会主义国家方面创造性地运用马克思列宁主义的最好的典范。
    1939年4月7日，法西斯意大利军队在阿尔巴尼亚海岸登陆。那时的君主制度的头子在占领者面前投降了。国王出卖了祖国，逃到外国去了。但是，人民在没有任何政党领导的情况下，自发地用战斗迎接了侵略者。可是，意大利军队镇压了人民的反抗，在几天之内占领了整个阿尔巴尼亚，并且把它变成了意大利的一个省。
    法西斯意大利占领阿尔巴尼亚显示出阿尔巴尼亚各个阶层直接地和显明的政治分化：工人、劳动农民、爱国知识分子、小资产阶级和中产阶级仇恨占领者，咀咒为外国占领开辟了道路的前索古国王的半封建半资本主义的制度，他们愿意为自己祖国的自由和独立而进行斗争；封建主、地主、富农、富有的工商资本家和军队里面大多数的军官同占领者联合起来，热心地为他们服务，反对人民。
    当时，阿尔巴尼亚没有任何政党，有的只是意大利人建立起来的一个阿尔巴尼亚的法西斯政党。在伟大的十月社会主义革命和马克思列宁主义思想的影响下，在大学生和工人中间出现了一些同情共产主义的人和小组。当阿尔巴尼亚被法西斯意大利占领的时候，共产主义小组加强了自己的活动；但是它们并不是统一的，它们没有明确的政治路线和组织路线。它们互相之间进行着斗争。经过很大的努力，三个共产主义小组才合并而建立了阿尔巴尼亚共产党。恩维尔·霍查同志对于阿尔巴尼亚共产党的建立起了主要的作用，他从党成立的最初时期直到现在，一直领导着中央委员会的工作，并正确地领导着它，按照马克思列宁主义的道路进行工作。
    阿尔巴尼亚共产党是在苏联已经参加了反对纳粹德国的第二次世界大战以后成立的。苏联军队为反对希特勒匪徒所进行的英勇斗争为阿尔巴尼亚人民开辟了从外国压迫下解放出来的道路，这一斗争也是唤起阿尔巴尼亚共产主义分子建立共产主义的政党和组织民族解放斗争的重要因素。
    阿尔巴尼亚共产党从诞生的那天起就号召阿尔巴尼亚人民组织武装起义，从外国压迫下解放祖国。党号召国内的一切爱国力量，不分阶级、政治见解、信仰和籍贯，都团结在民族解放阵线周围。党为了解放祖国还决心和封建主或资产阶级合作，同占领者进行斗争。由于阿尔巴尼亚共产党的正确政策，使包括最广大阶层的民族解放阵线在党仅成立一年后就组织起来了。
    从民族解放阵线建立以来，国内各阶级政治分化日益明显和更加迅速。最富有的一部分资产阶级、地主和大多数富农仍继续同侵略者合作，并同他们一道武装反对人民，反对民族解放阵线。我党组织了战斗队和游击队开始公开打击敌人的军队。和敌人站在一起的统治阶级由于畏惧民族解放斗争规模的壮大建立了反动组织“巴里·康毕塔尔”和“李加里契特”。我党竭力想使这些组织改变它们的方针而合并到民族解放阵线里来，但却没有成功。到1943年年中，这些代表封建残余、反动资产阶级和敌寇利益的敌对组织竟和侵略军建立了联合战线，拿起武器来反对民族解放阵线和人民的军队。这样，阿尔巴尼亚共产党组织的阿尔巴尼亚人民民族解放斗争，在最初就具有了两重性质：阿尔巴尼亚人民在民族解放斗争初期仅仅具有同外来侵略者斗争的性质，现在它就又具有阶级斗争的性质了，它要反对为敌人服务的封建主和反动的资产阶级。这样，民族解放斗争的目的就变成了两个：从外国占领者的压迫下解放祖国，同时推翻公开同敌人合作的地主和反动资产阶级的政权，建立人民的政权。
    苏联军队击败希特勒军队的辉煌胜利，使我国民族解放斗争得到强大的发展。党把最大的力量放在发动人民组织游击队和民族解放军上面。全体阿尔巴尼亚人民都参加了武装的民族解放斗争：将近10％的人民在1944年下半年参加了民族解放军的部队。党用热爱人民和忠于无产阶级国际主义的精神来教育民族解放军，正确地领导着它在全阿尔巴尼亚展开对意大利和德国占领者以及国内卖国贼的斗争。还在民族解放斗争时期，党就组织了人民政权的核心：它组织了乡、区和省的委员会，成立了全国民族解放委员会，这个委员会的执行机关是执行临时政府职责的反法西斯委员会。1944年11月29日，阿尔巴尼亚完全解放了，完全摧毁了地主和资产阶级的政权，建立了人民政权。阿尔巴尼亚民族解放军的两个师，根据党的指示，追击希特勒师团，并根据南斯拉夫共产党的要求，进入南斯拉夫疆界，援助南斯拉夫民族解放军同希特勒军队进行斗争。我们的师团和南斯拉夫的师团在南斯拉夫的考斯奥夫和敏道黑、门的内哥罗、波斯尼亚和黑塞哥维那地区并肩作战，继续同希特勒匪军战斗。
    在阿尔巴尼亚全部解放以后，在旧的统治阶级政权的废墟上，建立了劳动群众的政权。我党没有把政权分给其他政党，因为它是唯一捍卫人民利益并能把全体居民团结在自己周围、团结在民族解放阵线里面的政党；而那些从它们一成立就倒向占领者方面的政治组织，早在阿尔巴尼亚全国解放前夕就被消灭了。
    随着全国的解放，党就开始实现自己关于国家经济、政治和社会改造的纲领。党的迫切任务是完成资产阶级民主革命，同时用和平方法使资产阶级民主革命发展到社会主义革命。没收外国资本主义企业的财产，没收同占领者一道积极反对人民的地主资本家的财产，实行土地改革，使工业、银行、财政、交通运输、森林以及水力资源国有化，废除国家债务——所有这些措施和改革，主要是在1946年完成的。同时，这一切差不多是同时并行的。因此，虽然我们在1947年已经过渡到社会主义革命，但是，同过渡到社会主义有关的初期的一切措施，是同1946年完成的资产阶级民主革命最后阶段的一些措施交织在一起的。这是我们革命的特点。
    战争给人民带来的损失是巨大的，死伤人数占全国人口的7.3％，农民的房子有21％被烧毁或破坏，一切桥梁、港口和工厂都被毁坏了，三分之一以上的牲畜被杀害，国民经济被破坏。被战争破坏了的国民经济直到1948年才完全恢复。
    在苏联和各人民民主国家慷慨的和全面的帮助下，阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国在建设社会主义的基础中取得了伟大的胜利。总的说来，我们顺利地完成了第一个五年计划，这使阿尔巴尼亚从落后的农业国变成了一个工业农业国家。今年5月举行的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第三次代表大会总结了第一个五年计划完成的情况，并批准了发展国民经济和文化的第二个五年计划的指示。1956年就是第二个五年计划的第一年。
    在第一个五年计划的年代里，我们建立了年轻的工业——社会主义工业。它在整个国民经济中起着领导作用，是国家经济各部门今后发展的可靠基础。1955年工业总产量几乎比1938年多十一倍，就工业产品的总值来看，1938年全年所生产的，现在最多只要三十五天。
    和1938年比较，1955年石油的生产达到523％左右，煤的开采量增加五十二倍以上，铬矿的开采增加十六倍多，电气工业增加978％，建筑材料工业增加528％，木材工业增加九十三倍多，轻工业增加二十五倍以上，食品工业增加440％。在第一个五年计划期间还建立了新的工业部门，如机械工业、炼铜工业等。几乎89％的手工业都合作化了。
    虽然在第一个五年计划期间我们没有能使农业摆脱落后状态，但是农业发展中所取得的成就同过去相比却是很大的。在第一个五年计划期间，农业总产量增加了37％，播种面积增加了13％，小麦收获量增加了6％，玉蜀黍增加了62％，大米增加了58％，棉花增加了47％，糖萝卜增加了339％，烟草增加了113％，蔬菜增加了28％等。
    党中央在去年12月的全体会议上，作出了关于加快农业集体化的速度的决议。现在农业集体化正根据自愿和对贫农、中农进行说服工作的原则迅速地继续发展着。如果说在1950年农业中的社会主义成分占播种面积的8％，那末现在这个数目已经是39％了。农业集体化的主要形式是农业合作社。它是按照苏联集体农庄的形式结合我们的具体条件组成的。此外也有两种比较低级的形式。
    由于工农业生产的发展，使劳动群众的生活水平提高了。社会主义商业商品周转总额在1955年比1950年多105％。在第一个五年计划时期国民收入增加了近70％，职工的实际工资增加了近20％，农民的收入增加了30％左右。
    解放前80％以上的居民都不会写字读书，现在四十岁以下的人已经没有文盲了。目前有二十一万七千人、即全国人口的15％都在初级小学、七年制小学、中学、大学和夜校学习。
    如果说在1938年每一千人中人口的天然增殖率为十六点九，那末1955年这个数字就达到了二十九。
    第三次党代表大会提出，第二个五年计划的主要任务是继续发展工业，特别是采矿业，主要地是充分利用生产能力和内部潜力；同时也要加速发展农业，主要地是根据社会主义原则改造农业；并在上述措施的基础上，进一步改善阿尔巴尼亚人民的物质状况，提高人民的文化水平。
    劳动党所制定的阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国的对外政策一贯是和平政策。同伟大的苏联、伟大的人民中国以及其他人民民主国家的牢不可破的友谊，是我国对外政策的主要原则和基石。我们党教育人民热爱并无限忠实于苏联，因为我们党认为苏联是我国获得解放的决定性因素，是人民的利益、和平和社会主义的坚强有力的保卫者，是建设社会主义和共产主义最好的榜样。
    我党忠实于马克思列宁主义，紧密地联系人民群众，正确的马克思列宁主义的总路线，我国人民光辉的爱国主义精神以及苏联和社会主义阵营其他国家的全面帮助，是我党和我国人民取得历史性的胜利和巨大成就的源泉。
  　阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和全体阿尔巴尼亚人民都无限热爱光荣的中国共产党和伟大的中国人民。我党和我国人民都密切地注视着伟大的人民中国的蓬勃发展，为伟大的中国人民在中国共产党正确的领导下，在各方面所获得的巨大成就而感到无限欢欣。我党和我国人民都非常注意中国共产党第八次代表大会。我党中央委员会在最近一次全体会议上听取并批准了党中央委员会第一书记恩维尔·霍查的关于中国共产党第八次代表大会的报告，他曾率领了我们的参加中国共产党第八次代表大会的代表团。我党认为中国共产党第八次代表大会不仅对中国共产党有伟大的历史意义，而且对整个国际工人运动都有着伟大的历史意义。我们需要多多地学习中国共产党丰富的经验。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党是在社会主义已经越出了一个国家的范围而变成为世界体系和和平力量不断增长的情况下庆祝它成立的十五周年的。阿尔巴尼亚劳动党党员和全体阿尔巴尼亚人民在纪念这个纪念日的时候，怀着对在阿尔巴尼亚建设社会主义和共产主义的光辉前途的坚强信念，怀着对以光荣的苏维埃国家为首的强大的社会主义阵营的坚强信念。苏维埃国家在世界上第一个建成了社会主义并且现在正以坚定的步伐向建设共产主义迈步前进。
    我党和我国人民深深感激伟大的人民中国对我国建设新生活和社会主义方面的全面帮助。我党和我国人民将像爱护眼珠一样爱护阿尔巴尼亚人民和伟大的中国人民之间的友谊，并且要不断地巩固它。我们两国人民在建设社会主义和保卫和平的道路上走着共同的道路。
