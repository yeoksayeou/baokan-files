Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 7th (TASS): To celebrate the thirty-ninth anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution, the traditional military parade and mass procession were held on Red Square in Moscow today.

Thousands of people stood on the reviewing stands beside the Kremlin wall. Many foreign guests attended the viewing. Diplomatic envoys and military attachés from various countries to the Soviet Union were also present.

At exactly 10:00 a.m., the leaders of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government ascended the Lenin-Stalin Mausoleum. The audience greeted them with enthusiastic applause.

The Minister of Defense of the Soviet Union, Marshal of the Soviet Union Zhukov, accompanied by the commander of the parade, Marshal of the Soviet Union Moskalenko, inspected the troops lined up on Red Square and the streets leading to Red Square. After congratulating the heroic Soviet soldiers on the October Revolution Day, Marshal Zhukov ascended the platform of the Mausoleum and delivered a speech to the Soviet army, the Soviet working people, and foreign delegation members.

After Zhukov's speech, the Red Square resounded with loud "Hurrah!" cheers, and the Kremlin's artillery fired a salute. A combined band of thousands of people played the Soviet national anthem.

At the sound of a bugle, the parade began. Students of military academies marched past the reviewing stand in neat goose steps to the beat of the drums. People on the reviewing stands applauded this contingent of officers – the essence and pride of the Soviet people's armed forces. Military academies cultivate Soviet commanders who are skilled in modern military technology and weaponry (including atomic weapons, thermonuclear weapons, rocket weapons, and jet weapons). Alongside the young people marching on Red Square were famous generals renowned on the battlefields of the domestic war and during the Great Patriotic War. Cadets from the Frunze Naval School and border guards marched past the reviewing stand with vigorous strides.

Following them were students from the Suvorov Military School and the Leningrad Nakhimov Naval School. Those watching the parade were deeply impressed by the motorized infantry and paratrooper units.

The final part of the parade was the inspection of the powerful artillery. Following the anti-aircraft guns were rocket launchers, cannons of various calibers, and powerful field artillery.

The latest jet bombers and fighter planes flashed across the Red Square sky.

Immediately after the military parade, the festive procession of the working people of Moscow began.

Red velvet banners embroidered with ribbons entered Red Square. This was the flag of the city of Moscow. As always, this red flag led the festive procession of representatives of the working people.

The leaders of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government warmly greeted the marching masses from the central reviewing stand.

Athletes entered Red Square, holding aloft a large flag embroidered with a portrait of Lenin.

Before the applause for the athletes on the reviewing stand had subsided, the entire Red Square transformed: it turned crimson red, as the 1,200 red flags held by the marchers from the twelve districts of Moscow fluttered in the wind. Along with the red flags, a torrent of people surged into Red Square. The bright colors of the festive attire, countless flowers, and cheers created an unforgettable scene of a national festival, an unprecedented unity of the people, the Communist Party, and the Soviet government.

The procession carried thousands of banners and placards reporting work achievements. Many enterprises have exceeded their plans.

The working people of Moscow denounced the British and French imperialists and their henchman Israel. Muscovites raised voices of anger, expressed in the simple and clear slogans written on hundreds of placards: "No interference in Egypt!" "Imperialist aggressors get out of Egypt!"

Among the marchers were many vibrant, cheerful young people confident in their future. Today, the youth were filled with particularly joyful and proud feelings, because the Soviet government once again awarded the Komsomol (Young Communist League) the Order of Lenin to commend the great achievements of the Komsomol and the Soviet youth in socialist construction, especially their selfless labor in the victorious reclamation of wasteland, in response to the calls of the Communist Party and the Soviet government.

Representatives of the great fraternal Chinese people and the people of fraternal socialist countries marched into Red Square with the procession. These were workers from these countries who were interning in Moscow factories, and students studying at the capital's universities and scientific research institutes.

The Soviet people are very concerned about the events in Hungary. They angrily denounced the conspiracies of international reactionaries attempting to destroy the socialist achievements of the Hungarian working class and peasants. Muscovites held aloft placards congratulating the Hungarian Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government in the procession.

Festive music and songs never ceased on Red Square.

The October Revolution Day procession of representatives of the working people of Moscow demonstrated the unbreakable unity of the Soviet people and the Party, and the indomitable spirit of the Soviet people in their struggle to build a communist society in the Soviet Union and to fight for peace among all nations.

    莫斯科举行十月革命节阅兵和游行
    据新华社7日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：为庆祝伟大的十月社会主义革命三十九周年，今天在莫斯科红场上举行了传统的阅兵和群众游行。
    靠着克里姆林宫墙的观礼台上站着几千人。许多外国来宾也出席观礼。到场的还有各国驻苏联外交使节和武官。
    上午十时正，苏联共产党和苏联政府的领导人登上了列宁—斯大林陵墓。出席观礼的人对他们热烈鼓掌。
    苏联国防部长、苏联元帅朱可夫在检阅指挥官、苏联元帅莫斯卡连科陪同下，乘车检阅了排列在红场上和通向红场的街道上的部队。朱可夫元帅在向英勇的苏军战士祝贺十月革命节以后登上陵墓的台上，向苏联军队、苏联劳动人民和外国代表团人员发表了演说。
    朱可夫演说毕，红场上震响着宏亮的“乌拉！”欢呼声，克里姆林宫的炮台，发出了礼炮轰鸣。上千人组成的混合乐队奏着苏联国歌。
    号声一响，阅兵式开始，军事学院的学员们随着鼓声迈着整齐的正步走过检阅台。观礼台上的人们向这支军官队伍——苏联人民的武装部队的精华和骄傲——鼓掌。军事学院培育着熟练掌握现代军事技术和武器（包括原子武器、热核子武器、火箭武器、喷气式武器）的苏联指挥员。同青年们一道在红场上走过的有在国内战争战场上和在伟大卫国战争时期驰名的著名将军们。伏龙芝海军学校的学员们和边防军战士以雄健的步伐走过检阅台。
    往后是苏沃洛夫军事学校和列宁格勒纳希莫夫海军学校的学生。观礼的人，对摩托化步兵和伞兵部队的印象很深。
    阅兵式最后一部分是检阅强大的炮兵。走在高射炮后面的是火箭炮、各种口径的大炮和强大的野战炮。
    最新式的喷气式轰炸机和歼击机闪电般地从红场上空掠过。
    在阅兵式举行之后，莫斯科劳动人民的节日游行立刻就开始了。
    镶有绶带的红丝绒大旗进入了红场。这是莫斯科市旗。这面红旗和以往一样打在劳动人民代表的节日游行行列的前面。
    苏联共产党和苏联政府领导者们在中央观礼台向游行的群众热烈地致意。
    运动员们走进红场来了，他们举着的一面绣有列宁像的大旗凌空招展。
    观礼台上运动员的鼓掌声还未停息，整个红场改变了样子：它变成绛红色，莫斯科头十二个区的游行者所举的一千二百面红旗随风飘动。随着红旗，人群的洪流涌进了红场。节日装束的鲜丽颜色、无数的鲜花和欢呼声，形成了一付令人难忘的全民节日，人民、共产党和苏联政府空前未有的团结的场面。
    游行队伍中举着成千的报告工作成绩的横幅和标语牌。许多企业都超额完成了计划。
    莫斯科的劳动人民申斥英法帝国主义者和它们的走卒以色列。莫斯科人发出了愤怒的呼声，他们的呼声从成百成百的标语牌上写的简单明了的口号中表现出来，这些口号是：“不准干涉埃及！”、“帝国主义侵略军滚出埃及！”
    在游行者当中有许多朝气勃勃的、愉快的、确信自己未来的青年。今天青年们充满特别愉快和自豪的心情，因为苏联政府为了表扬一向热烈响应共产党和苏联政府号召的共青团和苏联青年在社会主义建设中的伟大功绩，特别是在胜利开垦荒地方面的忘我劳动，再一次奖给共青团一枚列宁勋章。
    伟大的兄弟中国人民和社会主义阵营各兄弟国家人民的代表随着游行队伍走到红场来了。这是在莫斯科各工厂中实习的这些国家的工人、在首都高等学校和各科学研究所中学习的学生。
    苏联人民非常关心匈牙利事件。他们愤怒地痛斥企图消灭匈牙利工人阶级和农民的社会主义成果的国际反动派的阴谋。莫斯科市民在游行队伍中高举着祝贺匈牙利工农革命政府的标语。
    红场上节日的音乐声和歌声一直没有停歇。
    莫斯科劳动人民代表十月革命节的游行显示了苏联人民和党的牢不可破的团结，显示了苏联人民为在苏联建成共产主义社会、为争取各国人民之间的和平而奋斗的不屈不挠的精神。
