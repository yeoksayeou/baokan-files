Dear brothers, sisters, and friends:
　　Just as we were eagerly expecting the Suez Canal issue to be resolved through peaceful negotiation, British and French imperialism brazenly launched a large-scale armed invasion against the Egyptian people. This barbaric and shameless act of aggression against the Egyptian people, a grave provocation to the people of Asia, Africa, and all peace-loving and righteous people in the world, fills Chinese women with immense anger.
　　Now, the invaders' planes and artillery are destroying peaceful Egyptian cities and slaughtering innocent Egyptian people. Egyptian women and children, enveloped in the flames of war, are suffering immense pain and disaster. This inhuman and beastly behavior seriously threatens peace in Asia, Africa, and the world. Chinese women cannot stand idly by in the face of this situation. We fully endorse the solemn statement issued by our government, demanding that the British and French governments immediately cease their aggression against Egypt. We resolutely stand with the peace-loving people of the world to fully support the just struggle of the Egyptian people.
　　Colonialists cannot reverse the wheels of progress. The clutches of colonialism are bound to be severed. If the British and French governments do not pull back from the brink, they will certainly play with fire and burn themselves. Now the Egyptian people are roaring, the people of Arab countries are roaring, the people of Asia and Africa have stood up, and all peace-loving and righteous people in the world stand on the side of the Egyptian people. We firmly believe that victory will surely belong to the Egyptian people who are fighting for justice, and lasting world peace must be realized!
　　Let us shout: Stop the war of aggression, down with colonialism! Long live the great struggle of the Egyptian people and the people of the world to defend peace!

    李德全的讲话
    亲爱的兄弟们，姊妹们，朋友们：
    正当我们殷切地期待着苏伊士运河问题能得到和平协商解决的时候，英法帝国主义竟悍然向埃及人民发动大规模的武装进攻。这种对埃及人民野蛮无耻的侵略行为，对亚非和全世界一切爱好和平和正义的人们严重的挑衅，我们中国妇女感到万分的愤怒。
    现在，侵略者的飞机、炮弹，正在摧毁埃及的和平城市，屠杀埃及无辜的人民。笼罩在战火里的埃及妇女和儿童，正遭受着莫大的痛苦和灾难。这种灭绝人性野兽般的行为，严重地威胁着亚非和世界的和平，对这种情况，中国妇女是不能坐视不理的。我们完全拥护我国政府所发表的严正声明，要求英法政府立即停止对埃及的进攻。我们坚决和全世界爱好和平的人民一道，全力支援埃及人民的正义斗争。
    殖民主义者是不能倒转时代前进的车轮的，殖民者的魔掌是一定要被斩断的。如果英法政府不悬崖勒马，就一定会玩火自焚，自食其果的。现在埃及人民在怒吼，阿拉伯国家的人民在怒吼，亚非人民站起来了，全世界一切爱好和平和正义的人民都站在埃及人民这一边，我们坚决相信，胜利一定属于为正义而斗争的埃及人民，世界的持久和平一定要实现！
    让我们高呼制止侵略战争，打倒殖民主义！埃及人民和全世界人民保卫和平的伟大斗争胜利万岁！
