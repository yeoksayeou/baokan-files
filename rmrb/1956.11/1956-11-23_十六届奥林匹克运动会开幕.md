Xinhua News Agency, Melbourne, 22nd: The 16th Olympic Games opened this afternoon in Melbourne, Australia.

Athletes from over sixty entities are participating in this Olympic Games, the first to be held in the Southern Hemisphere. Because the International Olympic Committee violated the tradition of the Olympic Games and the Olympic Charter by not rescinding Taiwan's right to send athletes to the Games independently, Chinese athletes did not participate in this Games.

Egypt, which had originally registered to send athletes, had announced its withdrawal from the Games earlier due to the invasion by Britain, France, and Israel. Iraq and Lebanon decided not to participate in the competition to support Egypt and protest Australia's attitude on the Egyptian issue. The Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland also withdrew from the competition for other reasons.

The weather in Melbourne today was clear and sunny. Residents warmly welcomed the day. The road from the Olympic Village to the stadium was crowded with over 200,000 people. The area outside the stadium was also packed.

At 3:30 PM, athletes from various entities entered the stadium in the traditional order, led by the Greek team, followed by the alphabetical order in English. Australian athletes, as the hosts, entered the venue last. They were welcomed by over 100,000 spectators in the stands.

At 4:25 PM, the Games were declared open. The Olympic flag with the five rings was raised on the flagpole, and 5,000 pigeons were released, while a salute was fired. An Australian athlete, the last runner in the torch relay, lit the Olympic flame, which had been transmitted from Mount Olympia, 12,000 miles away. This Olympic torch will burn until the end of the Games.

Famous Australian long-distance runner Landy took the oath on behalf of all participating athletes. At this point, the world games held every four years were officially inaugurated.

The first event to start was basketball. Tonight, the Soviet team faced the Canadian team. The Soviet team won with a score of 97 to 59.

    十六届奥林匹克运动会开幕
    新华社22日讯　墨尔本消息：第十六届奥林匹克运动会今天下午在澳大利亚的墨尔本开幕了。
    参加这个第一次在南半球举行的奥林匹克运动会的，有六十几个单位的运动员。由于国际奥林匹克委员会违背奥林匹克运动会的传统和奥林匹克宪章，不取消台湾单独派运动员参加运动会的权利，中国运动员没有参加这一届的运动会。
    原来报名派运动员参加的埃及因为受到英、法和以色列的侵略，在早些时候已经宣布退出这届运动会。伊拉克和黎巴嫩为了支持埃及，并抗议澳大利亚在埃及问题上的态度，都决定不参加比赛。荷兰、西班牙和瑞士由于其他原因也退出了比赛。
    墨尔本今天天气晴朗。居民们热烈地迎接这个日子。从奥林匹克村一直到运动场的路上拥塞着二十多万人。运动场外面也挤得水泄不通。
    下午三时三十分，各个单位的运动员根据传统由希腊选手领头，按照英文字母的排列顺序先后进入运动场。澳大利亚运动员是主人，所以在最后进入会场。他们受到了看台上十万多观众的欢迎。
    四时二十五分，运动会宣告开幕。旗杆上升起了五个环的奥林匹克旗，大会放起了五千只鸽子，同时鸣放了礼炮。拿着火炬接力队最后一棒的一位澳大利亚运动员，把从一万二千英里以外的奥林匹亚山传来的奥林匹克之火点燃起来。这个奥林匹克火炬将燃到运动会结束才熄灭。
    澳大利亚著名长跑家蓝迪，代表全体参加运动会的运动员进行宣誓。到这里，四年一度的世界运动会就正式揭幕了。
    运动会第一个开始比赛的项目是篮球，今天晚上，苏联队同加拿大队交锋。比赛结果苏联队以九十七比五十九获胜。
