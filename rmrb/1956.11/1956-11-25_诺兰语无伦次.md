    Nolan's Incoherent Ramblings

    Nolan, who recently served as the U.S. representative to the 11th United Nations General Assembly, seemed to be on edge as soon as he arrived at the United Nations. During a meeting discussing the Indian representative's proposal to include the issue of restoring China's representation on the agenda, Nolan, almost like a madman, lashed out wildly. He not only made absurd attacks against our country, but also forgot the basic diplomatic etiquette of international conferences, launching personal attacks against the Indian representative, even describing India as the "main spokesman" for the Soviet Union. As a result, the Indian representative demanded an apology from the head of the U.S. delegation, Lodge, and asked Mr. Nolan to "see a doctor or a psychiatrist."

    Nolan's predicament is not accidental. The U.S. government sent him to the United Nations this time mainly to use Nolan's notorious reputation as a "senator representing Taiwan" to coerce other UN member states not to raise the issue of restoring China's representation. However, the situation is very unfavorable, and the number of countries requesting discussion of this issue at this UN General Assembly is greater than ever before. This could not help but make Nolan fly into a rage and become incoherent.

    People like Nolan would do well to "see a doctor or a psychiatrist" as soon as possible, otherwise, they may end up like former U.S. Secretary of Defense Forrestal, going insane and committing suicide by jumping out of a building. (Zhen)

    诺兰语无伦次
    新近充当美国出席十一届联合国大会的代表诺兰，一跑到联合国就显得神经紧张。在一次讨论印度代表提出要把恢复中国代表权的问题列入议程的会议上，诺兰几乎像疯子一样信口乱咬。他不仅胡说八道地攻击我国，而且忘记了在国际会议上的起码的外交礼节，对印度代表施行人身攻击，甚至把印度说成是苏联的“主要发言人”。因此，印度代表要求美国代表团团长洛奇道歉，并且要诺兰先生“去看看医生或者是精神病医生”。
    诺兰搞得这样狼狈不是偶然的。因为美国政府这回派他到联合国去，主要就是想利用诺兰的“代表台湾的参议员”的臭名声，胁迫其他联合国会员国，不得提起恢复中国代表权的问题。可是，形势非常不妙，这回联合国大会上要求讨论这个问题的国家比以往任何时候都更多。这就不能不使诺兰暴跳如雷，语无伦次了。
    诺兰之流最好趁早“去看看医生或者是精神病医生”，不然的话，真有可能会像美国前国防部长福莱斯特一样，落得一个发疯和跳楼自杀的下场。　（真）
