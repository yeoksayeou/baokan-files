Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, November 19th: According to a report by "Nepszabadsag" on November 17th: On the evening of the 16th, a delegation from the Budapest Central Workers' Council met again with Hungarian Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Government Premier Kadar to convey to him the workers' final decision on the issue of resuming work.

    At the beginning of the conversation, the representatives expressed their firm belief that only through joint efforts could the country be saved from its current critical situation. They were clear on this point. Based on this, the Budapest Central Workers' Council, with the consent of the city's workers, believed that resuming work was the correct course of action.

    Premier Kadar spoke about the events of the past three weeks, emphasizing that counter-revolutionaries had also participated in these events. He said that the recent increase by the United States in funds to aid counter-revolutionary activities in socialist countries from 100 million to 500 million dollars was a noteworthy fact. Perhaps you have heard that Cardinal Mindszenty, who is now residing in the American embassy, has expressed the opinion that he would prefer to see the Nagy government over the Kadar government. Why was the communist Nagy good for Mindszenty? Is this a normal thing? They are cleverly discussing politics because they are putting workers' slogans on their own banners.

    Kadar said that the strike has begun to turn into an unpopular slogan. The workers know that if things continue like this, we will collapse. In this situation, the enemy hopes to extort something: an opposition government, or no party organizations in the factories.

    At this point, one of the representatives said that the reason why resuming work is so difficult is that the workers believe their only weapon is the strike. If the strike is now interrupted, how can they be guaranteed that their demands will be met?

    In his response, Kadar referred to what he had said the day before and pointed out that the main guarantee is the worker-peasant government, whose goals and interests are consistent with those of the people. Precisely because of this, the government should and will satisfy all the reasonable demands of the working class. The representatives should understand this and rest assured, but they must also understand that the most important thing now is for the country to stand up, begin production, and strengthen the people's power. If these things are in place, everything else will be easy to achieve.

    Many of the representatives said that the lack of public safety makes many workers very worried. Kadar agreed with this, believing that this concern was justified. However, if work resumes, there is transportation, and order and stability are restored, then these extraordinary phenomena will automatically disappear, and the desolate scene in the capital will change accordingly.

    In order to restore order as soon as possible, those present suggested that they would help the government by organizing teams from the best people in the factories and sending them to join the police force.

    Kadar also said that we will organize armed worker self-defense forces. A portion of the workers will be given weapons and participate in military training. We must first establish a regular army and strengthen the police first. If the workers' regime is endangered again, there will be people to defend it. Therefore, we have decided to organize the worker self-defense forces into a permanent entity.

    The withdrawal of Soviet troops will depend on the activities of the worker self-defense forces. Kadar also mentioned that the first national defense corps had begun its duties yesterday.

    The representatives expressed their trust in the government and asked the government to trust the Budapest Workers' Council. If the government relies on the consciousness and wisdom of the workers, it will feel capable of fulfilling its mission.

    Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, November 19th: (By our reporter Li Nan) The work of restoring stability in Hungary is gradually making progress. The general situation is that the situation in the provinces is better than in the capital, and the order in the capital is now much better than it was a few days ago.

    According to people who have recently returned from traveling in the provinces, factories in various cities outside the capital have resumed work, and schools have reopened. Although some agricultural cooperatives have disintegrated, many farmers are still willing to remain in the cooperatives. Autumn plowing and sowing are underway. Transportation and trade are also normal. The first long-distance train departed from Budapest to the southern city of Szeged on the 17th. There are also trains running from Budapest to the Czechoslovak border. Only in the forest areas are there still a few scattered counter-revolutionaries in hiding.

    The restoration of normal life in Budapest is progressing more slowly than in the provinces, but it has improved in recent days. Representatives of workers from various factories have met with Premier Kadar of the Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Government several times and have promised to return to work by Monday (the 19th).

    Residents have carried out necessary cleaning and tidying on the streets. The order on the streets has improved significantly compared to a few days ago. Six tram lines have been opened in the urban area, and railway workers have resumed work. Hungarian soldiers and police are checking the documents of vehicles passing over several bridges. There is panic buying in department stores, mainly because residents are worried about inflation. The supply of vegetables and grain is sufficient. However, public transportation has largely not been restored.

    On the streets of Budapest, one can still see seditious leaflets posted by bad elements and counter-revolutionaries, although not in large numbers. They hope to incite the people to distrust the government. Some thugs are threatening workers in factories to prevent them from returning to work. However, many workers, regardless of threats and obstruction, continue to insist on working or are preparing to resume work.

    The reasons for the slower progress of restoration work in the capital, in addition to the activities of counter-revolutionaries and irresponsible elements and the confusion that still exists among the masses, is the complete disintegration of various party and government organs in this incident. Currently, many agencies cannot find people; some have only a few people in charge. The army and police have to be reorganized. Many cadres in the agencies were called to work by radio and only started working a few days ago. The supply of raw materials is also a major problem. For example, restoring tram traffic to the streets requires a considerable amount of electrical wire.

    Currently, there is still a curfew in the capital at night, and Soviet military vehicles patrol the streets from time to time.

    The general situation is optimistic, and the mood of the people is beginning to calm down. People are increasingly expressing their trust in the people's regime. The Hungarians encountered by the reporter all expressed that socialism and the people's democratic system must absolutely not be lost, and that landlords must not be allowed to take back the land and capitalists must not be allowed to return. As for restoring Budapest to its original state, it will still take considerable time.

    卡达尔说重要问题是复工和加强人民政权
    匈牙利各地恢复工作逐步进展
    据新华社布达佩斯19日电　据“叭嗣褡杂杀ā?11月17日报道：16日晚上，布达佩斯中央工人委员会代表团又一次会见了匈牙利工农革命政府总理卡达尔，向他转达了工人有关复工问题的最后决定。
    在谈话开始的时候，代表们表示他们深信只有共同努力才能把国家从目前的严重局势中拯救出来。他们在这方面是清楚的。根据这点，布达佩斯中央工人委员会在取得全市工人的同意以后认为复工是正确的。
    卡达尔总理谈到了过去三周的事件，强调指出，在这个事件中，反革命也参加进去了。他说，美国最近把在社会主义国家援助反革命活动的款项从一亿美元增加到五亿美元，这是值得注意的事实。或许你们已经听说，现在住在美国使馆的红衣主教明曾蒂发表意见说，比起卡达尔政府来说他更愿意看到纳吉政府。为什么共产党人的纳吉对明曾蒂是好的呢？这是正常的事情吗？他们在巧妙地谈论政治，因为他们把工人的口号放在自己的旗帜上。
    卡达尔说，罢工已经开始变为不得民心的口号。工人们知道这样下去我们就要垮了。在这种情况下敌人希望敲诈出一些东西来：一个反对派政府，或者是工厂中不要有党组织。
    这时代表中的一人说，复工之所以如此困难，是因为工人们认为他们唯一的武器是罢工。如果现在中断罢工如何保证要求满足。
    卡达尔在回答中提到他前天谈过的话，并且指出，最主要的保证是工农政府，其目标和利益是同人民一致的。正因为如此，政府应该而且将会满足工人阶级的一切合理要求。代表团人员应理解这一点并且放心，但还要懂得，现在最重要的是国家要站立起来，开始生产，加强人民政权。如果这些都有了，其他的一切都容易实现。
    代表中许多人说由于缺乏公共安全，使许多工人很担心。卡达尔同意这一点，认为这种担心是有理由的。但是如果开工了，有了交通，恢复了秩序和安定，那么这些非常的现象将自动消除，首都的凄凉景象便会随着改变过来。
    为了及早恢复秩序，在场的人提出他们将帮助政府，由工厂里最好的人组织队伍并派他们参加警察队伍。
    卡达尔还说，我们将组织武装的工人自卫队。工人中的一部分将得到武器并参加军事训练。我们要先建立正规的军队，先加强警察。如果工人政权再次遭到危险时就有人保卫它。因此，我们决定把工人自卫队组织成为经常的性质。
    苏军的撤退要看工人自卫队活动的情况而定。卡达尔也提到昨日第一个国防军团已开始执行职务。
    代表们表示信任政府，同时请政府信任首都工人委员会，政府依靠工人的自觉和明智，将会感到自己有能力来完成自己的使命。
    据新华社布达佩斯19日电　本社记者李楠报道，匈牙利恢复安定的工作正在逐步获得进展。总的情况是外地比首都好，首都的秩序现在也比数日前大有改善。
    据最近从外省巡回回来的人说，外地各城市工厂已经复工，学校已经开学。农业合作社虽然瓦解了一些，但是许多农民仍然愿意留在合作社内。秋耕秋种正在进行。运输和贸易情况也是正常的。第一列长途列车17日从布达佩斯开往南部大城市塞格德。也有列车从布达佩斯开往捷克斯洛伐克边境。只是森林地区还有少数分散的反革命分子潜伏。
    布达佩斯正常生活的恢复较外省进度较慢，但是最近几天来也有好转。各厂工人代表们已经几次前往会见工农革命政府总理卡达尔，并且答应在星期一（19日）前一律上工。
    在街道上，居民们已经进行了必要的整理收拾。街道上的秩序比数日前有明显的改进。市区已经有六条电车路通车，铁路工人已经复工。匈牙利军队和警察在几座桥上检查来往车辆的证件。百货商店里有抢购货物的现象，这主要是因为居民们担心通货膨胀所致。蔬菜和粮食的供应都很充分。但是，公共交通仍大部没有恢复。
    在布达佩斯街道上还可以看到坏分子和反革命分子所张贴的煽动传单，虽然数量不多。他们希望煽动人民不信任政府。一些暴徒们在工厂里威胁工人，阻止工人复工。但是，许多工人不顾威胁和阻挠，仍然坚持工作或者准备复工。
    首都的恢复工作进展较慢的原因除了反革命分子和不负责任分子的活动和人民群众中还存在着混乱情绪外，各个党政机关在这次事变中完全解体也是个重要原因。目前许多机关找不到人，有的只有上面负责的几个人。军队和警察都要重新组织。许多机关的干部都是经过无线电呼唤，在几天前才上工的。原料和材料的供应也是个大问题。例如恢复各街道的电车交通就需要相当大数量的电线。
    现在，首都的晚上仍然戒严，入夜，苏军车辆不时在街上巡逻。
    总的情况是乐观的，人民的情绪开始平定下来了。人民越来越表示信任人民政权。记者接触到的匈牙利人都表示绝对不能让社会主义和人民民主制度丧失掉，不能让地主夺回土地和让资本家重新回来。至于要恢复布达佩斯原来的状况，还需要相当的时间。
