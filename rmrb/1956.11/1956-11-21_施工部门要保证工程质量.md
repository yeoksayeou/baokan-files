    Construction Departments Must Guarantee Engineering Quality
    A letter from the General Office of the Ministry of Construction Engineering states: The article "Construction Departments Need to Establish Technical Inspection Agencies" published in the People's Daily on September 16th, we believe this suggestion is very correct. Ensuring engineering quality is the primary task of our capital construction units. Our ministry issued instructions to all subordinate units on September 17th of last year to strengthen technical supervision work. Before the technical responsibility system is universally established and improved, technical inspection stations should be established at the company (engineering office) level in work areas and engineering offices equivalent to work areas. To date, most units have established technical inspection agencies, but some units are understaffed and their work has not been carried out effectively. Recently, we have organized working groups to inspect the quality of key engineering projects, and instructed all regions to establish and improve technical inspection agencies as soon as possible, strengthen technical inspection work, strengthen political education for all employees, implement the mass self-inspection and handover system for quality, and systematically train and improve the technical level of foremen and team leaders, and resolutely construct according to operating procedures.
    This article reflects that some units once had the saying "Party B is responsible for construction, Party A is responsible for quality." We believe this statement is incorrect. Construction units are not only responsible for construction but must also guarantee engineering quality and must be practically responsible for technical issues in construction. Regarding Party A setting up supervisory agencies on construction sites, we welcome this, but the responsibilities of the construction department must not be relaxed because Party A has such an agency.

### 施工部门要保证工程质量

    施工部门要保证工程质量
    建筑工程部办公厅来信说：人民日报9月16日发表“施工部门需要设立技术检查机构”一文，我们认为这个意见很对。保证工程质量是我们基本建设单位的首要任务。我部在去年9月17日就曾指示所属各单位加强技术监督工作，在技术责任制度还未普遍建立和健全的时候，应以公司（工程处）为单位在工区和相当于工区的工程处设立技术检查站。到目前为止，大部分单位已经建立了技术检查机构，但还有一些单位力量不足，工作未很好进行。最近我们已组织工作组到重点工程单位检查工程质量，并指示各地尽速建立并健全技术检查机构，加强技术检查工作，加强对全体职工的政治教育，贯彻群众对质量自检和交接制度，并有计划的培训提高工长和小组长的技术水平，坚决按操作规程施工。
    这篇文章反映：有的单位曾有过“乙方管施工甲方管质量”的说法，我们认为这种说法是不正确的。施工单位不但管施工，同时必须保证工程质量，对施工中的技术问题必须切实负责。关于甲方在工地设立监督机构，我们表示欢迎，但不能因甲方有此机构而放松施工部门的责任。
