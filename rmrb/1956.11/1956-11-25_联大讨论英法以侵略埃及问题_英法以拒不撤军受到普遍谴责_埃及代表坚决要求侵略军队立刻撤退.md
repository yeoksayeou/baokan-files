Xinhua News Agency, November 24th dispatch from New York: The United Nations General Assembly discussed the Near East situation caused by the British, French, and Israeli aggression against Egypt at its plenary meeting on the morning of the 23rd.

The proposal submitted by twenty-one Asian and African countries, again demanding that Israel, Britain, and France comply with the United Nations resolution and immediately withdraw their troops from Egypt, was formally submitted to the General Assembly at the morning meeting. The delegations of the United States, Yugoslavia, India, Colombia, Norway, and Canada also submitted a joint proposal at the meeting, suggesting that the United Nations Secretary-General negotiate on the issue of clearing the Suez Canal channel.

The first speaker at the morning meeting was Sudanese representative Mahgoub. He pointed out how Britain and France, violating all principles of international law, perfidiously prepared for the attack on Egypt under the guise of so-called "peace" and "cooperation."

They later refused to obey the General Assembly Emergency Meeting’s resolution of November 2nd regarding an immediate ceasefire, trying to buy time to realize military deployments.

The Sudanese representative continued, two weeks ago, the United Nations General Assembly Emergency Meeting demanded the immediate withdrawal of aggressor troops from Egypt. However, Britain and France ignored the United Nations resolution. They used various tricks and put forward various conditions to keep their troops in Egypt.

The Sudanese representative expressed firm support for the twenty-one-nation proposal.

Czechoslovak representative David said in his speech that the people of all countries expect the United Nations to take measures to stop the aggression and force the aggressor troops to withdraw from Egypt. David said that people also demand that those governments that have carried out aggression and have been condemned by world public opinion and the vast majority of United Nations member states will obey the resolutions of the General Assembly.

The Czechoslovak delegation supports the proposal to demand the withdrawal of aggressor troops from Egyptian territory. The Czechoslovak delegation also believes that the aggressors should compensate Egypt for the material losses it has suffered.

Egyptian representative Fawzi then made a brief speech. He said: "Today, as I speak to the General Assembly, conflicts and atrocities are taking place in Port Said. Conflicts and atrocities are taking place in the Gaza Strip. In these two places in the Arab world, massacres and robberies are being carried out against the people." He pointed out that just as the United Nations General Assembly was discussing new proposals, Egypt's sovereignty was being grossly violated. Britain, France, and Israel are still ignoring the resolution passed by the United Nations General Assembly Emergency Meeting on the immediate withdrawal of troops from Egypt.

The head of the Egyptian delegation reminded the General Assembly that the aggressors are trying to delay the implementation of this resolution, making the establishment of a United Nations force and the clearing of the canal conditions for the withdrawal of their troops. He pointed out that it is precisely the continued presence of the aggressor troops that is hindering the solution of "important issues such as clearing the canal." The Egyptian representative finally reiterated his firm demand that the aggressor troops must withdraw immediately.

Jordanian representative Abdul Monem Rifa'i pointed out that Britain, France, and Israel's refusal to implement the United Nations resolution on troop withdrawal is a very serious matter.

Rifa'i said that failure to comply with the United Nations General Assembly's resolution urging foreign troops to withdraw from Egypt "is a continuation of the act of aggression."

British Foreign Secretary Lloyd, in his speech, reiterated that Britain would only be prepared to withdraw its troops when "the United Nations Emergency Force is able to effectively undertake the tasks assigned to it." He once again defended Britain's aggressive actions against Egypt. He indicated that Britain's withdrawal of troops depends on whether the Suez Canal issue can be resolved to its satisfaction.

Syrian representative Farid Zeineddine said that the United Nations General Assembly’s earlier resolution calling for foreign troops to withdraw from Egypt was very clear: “It should be a complete and immediate withdrawal.”

He said, however, that twenty days have passed since the General Assembly said this. "The current situation is: these troops continue to occupy the areas they seized by acts of aggression, trying to hide themselves behind symbolic withdrawals or other excuses."

He asked the United Nations to support the twenty-one-nation proposal and quickly urge the aggressor troops to withdraw from Egypt.

Argentine representative Rear Admiral Olivieri, the last speaker, said that he believed that negotiations to resolve the Suez Canal issue could only take place after British and French troops had withdrawn from the canal.

He added that in order to finally resolve the Arab-Israeli conflict, Israeli troops must withdraw behind the 1949 armistice line.

Representatives from Colombia and Panama also spoke at the morning meeting.

    联大讨论英法以侵略埃及问题
    英法以拒不撤军受到普遍谴责
    埃及代表坚决要求侵略军队立刻撤退
    据新华社24日讯　纽约消息：联合国大会在23日上午全体会议上讨论了关于英国、法国和以色列侵略埃及而造成的近东局势问题。
    二十一个亚非国家提出的再次要求以色列和英法遵守联合国决议立即自埃及撤军的提案在上午会议上正式提交给大会。美国、南斯拉夫、印度、哥伦比亚、挪威和加拿大的代表团也在会上提出了一项联合提案，建议联合国秘书长就清理苏伊士运河航道问题进行谈判。
    在上午会议上第一个发言的是苏丹代表马哈古卜。他指出英国和法国如何违背国际法的一切原则，在所谓“和平”和“合作”的幌子下背信弃义地准备了对埃及的进攻。
    它们后来又拒绝服从联大紧急会议11月2日关于立刻停火的决议，力图争取时间来实现军事部署。
    苏丹代表继续说，早在两个星期以前，联合国大会紧急会议就要求侵略军队立刻退出埃及。但是，英国和法国不理睬联合国的决议。它们施展各种诡计，提出种种条件，要把自己的军队保留在埃及。
    苏丹代表表示坚决拥护二十一国提案。
    捷克斯洛伐克代表戴维在发言中说，世界各国人民期待联合国采取措施制止侵略并且使侵略军撤出埃及。戴维说，人们还要求那些进行侵略而遭到世界公众和绝大多数联合国会员国谴责的政府将服从联大的决议。
    捷克斯洛伐克代表团支持关于要求侵略国军队撤出埃及领土的提案。捷克斯洛伐克代表团还认为侵略者应当赔偿埃及所蒙受的物质损失。
    埃及代表法齐接着作了简短的发言。他说：“今天当我在对大会发言的时候，在塞得港正发生着冲突和暴行。在加沙地带发生着冲突和暴行。在阿拉伯世界的这两个地方，正在对老百姓进行着屠杀和抢劫。”他指出，就在联合国大会讨论新的提案的时候，埃及的主权受到极粗暴的损害。英国、法国和以色列现在仍旧不理睬联合国大会紧急会议通过的关于把军队立刻撤出埃及的决议。
    埃及代表团团长提醒大会注意，侵略者企图拖延执行这一决议，而以成立联合国部队、清理运河等等为撤退自己军队的条件。他指出，正是侵略军队的继续盘据，阻碍了“像清理运河这种重要问题的解决”。埃及代表最后再次坚决要求侵略军队必须立即撤退。
    约旦代表阿卜杜勒·莫奈姆·里法伊指出，英国、法国和以色列拒绝执行联合国的撤军决议是一件性质很严重的事。
    里法伊说，不听从联合国大会敦促外国军队自埃及撤退的决议，“就是侵略行为的延续”。
    英国外交大臣劳埃德在发言中重申英国一定要等到“在联合国紧急部队能够有效地承担起交给它的任务时”，才准备撤退它的军队。他再一次为英国侵略埃及的行动辩护。他表明英国的撤军取决于苏伊士运河问题是不是能得到为它所满意的解决。
    叙利亚代表法里德·宰尼丁说，联合国大会早先要外国军队从埃及撤退的决议规定得很清楚，“应该立即全部撤退。”
    他说，但是，自从联大说了这句话以来，已经有二十天过去了。“现在的局势是：这些部队继续占据着他们以侵略行动占领的地区，试图在象征性的撤退或其他借口的后面来隐藏他们自己。”
    他要求联合国支持二十一国提案，赶快促使侵略国军队撤出埃及。
    阿根廷代表奥利维埃里海军少将最后一个发言说，他认为，只有在英国和法国军队撤离运河以后，解决苏伊士运河问题的谈判才能进行。
    他又说，为了最后解决阿拉伯—以色列纠纷，以色列军队必须撤退到1949年停战线后面。
    在上午会议发言的还有哥伦比亚和巴拿马的代表。
