The New Jin Pig is one of China's finest pig breeds. Not only are these pigs widely welcomed by the masses in various parts of Liaoning Province, but in the past two years, farmers from other regions have also rushed to the Xin Jin area to purchase breeding pigs. According to preliminary estimates, in the six or seven years since liberation, a total of more than 40,000 New Jin Pigs have been supplied by Xin Jin County, the place of origin, to other counties and provinces. How were the New Jin Pigs cultivated? It's a long story. As early as thirty-four years ago, farmers in Tangjiafang Village, Xin Jin County, crossed foreign Berkshire pigs with local pigs. During the long process of self-crossing the hybrid offspring, and through careful feeding and selection, the New Jin Pig of today was formed. This type of pig later gradually propagated throughout the county. Currently, the county has as many as 1,500 superior breeding sows available for breeding.

The New Jin Pig has two major characteristics: saving feed and rapid fattening. Local farmers mainly feed pigs with peanut leaves, using peanut leaves, sweet potato leaves, green grass, wild vegetables, etc., to prepare fermented feed, and supplementing with a small amount of soybean cake and other concentrated feed. Under these same feeding conditions, ordinary pigs can grow to about 120 jin in ten months, while New Jin Pigs can grow to more than 150 jin. If the feed is good, the maximum can reach more than 500 jin. Ordinary pigs need six to seven jin of feed to gain one jin of meat, while New Jin Pigs only need four to five jin of feed. In addition, this type of pig has the advantages of thin skin and thick meat, so farmers like to raise them.

The New Jin Pig also has a higher litter size, generally producing nine to twelve piglets per litter, with the highest being eighteen to twenty-two piglets. At forty days weaning (forty-five to fifty-five days after birth), the average weight of the piglets is more than sixteen kilograms. Superior adult pigs average more than 200 kilograms, with a height of 75 centimeters and a length of 160 centimeters. From an external point of view, the New Jin Pig has a straight back, a long body, a plump and round buttocks, large ears that tilt slightly forward, thin skin, and sparse and evenly distributed hair.

In recent years, various counties in Liaoning Province, as well as Jilin, Heilongjiang, Inner Mongolia, Shandong, Hebei, and other places have requested a large number of New Jin Pigs for breeding, and breeding pigs are already in short supply. Currently, Liaoning Province is taking some measures to vigorously develop the production of New Jin Pigs. The province has established three large pig farms, and each county has set up breeding pig farms to carry out the breeding of New Jin Pigs, in order to gradually meet the needs of the province and other regions for New Jin Pig breeds.

    生长快、肉质好的新金猪
    刘广文　丁志本
    新金猪是我国最优良的猪种之一。这种猪不仅辽宁省各地群众普遍欢迎，近两年来外地农民，也都争先恐后地到新金地区选购猪种。据初步估算，解放后六、七年来，由产地新金县供应到外县和外省的新金猪共达四万多头。新金猪是怎样培育出来的呢？说起来话长。远在三十四年以前，新金县唐家房村的农民就用外国的巴克夏种猪与当地猪交配，在杂交后代自交的漫长过程中，经过细心地饲养和选育，就形成了今天的新金猪。这种猪后来就逐渐在全县繁殖起来。目前，全县可繁殖的优良种母猪已达一千五百头。
    新金猪具有省饲料和育肥快的两大特点。当地农民喂猪以花生叶为主，把花生叶、甘薯叶、青草、野菜等调制成发酵饲料，另外再补给少量豆饼和别的精料。同是在这样饲养条件下，一般的猪十个月可长一百二十斤左右，而新金猪可长一百五十斤以上，如果饲料好，最高可达五百斤以上。一般的猪每增长一斤肉，需六——七斤饲料，而新金猪只需四——五斤饲料。再加这种猪又有皮薄肉厚的优点，所以，农民都喜欢饲养它。
    新金猪的产仔能力也较高，一般每窝产九——十二头，最高的产十八——二十二头，小猪四十离奶时（生下后四十五至五十五天）体重平均在十六公斤以上。较优良的成年猪平均达二百公斤以上，体高七十五公分，体长一百六十公分。从外形上看，新金猪背部平直，身躯长，臀部丰圆，大耳朵稍向前倾，皮薄，毛较稀且分布均匀。
    由于近来辽宁省内各县以及吉林、黑龙江、内蒙古、山东、河北等地都要求大量繁殖新金猪，种猪已经供不应求。现在，辽宁省正在采取一些措施，大力发展新金猪的生产。省里已成立了三个大养猪场，各县分别设立了种猪场，进行新金猪的繁育工作，以便逐步满足省内外对新金猪种的需要。（附图片）
