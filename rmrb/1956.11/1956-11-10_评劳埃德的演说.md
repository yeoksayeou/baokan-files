Commenting on Lloyd's Speech
　　　　Xing Xiangchao

What the Anglo-French aggressors and their accomplices are planning for Egypt can be clearly seen from British Foreign Secretary Lloyd's broadcast speech on the evening of the 7th.

As usual, Lloyd described the Anglo-French aggression against Egypt as being for the sake of "peace," but he also said some things from the heart. He said that Britain's "concern" for the Middle East was because "the Middle East is the thoroughfare between Europe, Asia, and Africa, it contains a large amount of oil resources; it has the Suez Canal." The reason why Britain wants to invade Egypt is so that it can continue to be "concerned" about these things for thousands of years.

Lloyd shamelessly boasted about the achievements of the aggression against Egypt, as if it were not a shameful thing for Britain and France, two major powers, to deal with one Egypt, and only occupy a part of Port Said after so many days of fighting. For the likes of Lloyd, what is comforting is that they have finally climbed onto the coast of Egypt and gained a foothold there. This makes them think that they can use the established facts to blackmail and threaten, to achieve the goals that Britain and France cannot achieve by military attack.

On this point, Lloyd did not hide it, saying, "We have prompted the United Nations to face the harsh facts of the situation," "We have successfully created a situation through our actions, in which there is a real hope of obtaining a lasting solution under the protection of the United Nations."

The lasting solution that Lloyd wants to obtain, according to him, is to "permanently resolve the events in the Middle East" and "make satisfactory arrangements for the management of the Suez Canal." In other words, the purpose of Britain's invasion of Egypt is to forever suppress the threat of the national independence movement in the Middle East to British colonial rule, and to realize the so-called "international control" plan to plunder the Suez Canal.

Lloyd's so-called achieving these goals "under the protection of the United Nations" is to do so through the United Nations Emergency Force. He made the following request: The United Nations forces must "be substantially capable of carrying out the tasks we have already undertaken," that is, to undertake the task of occupying Egyptian territory. He said that if this is achieved, "then no one will be happier than us."

Of course, the aggressors would undoubtedly be very happy if they achieved their aggressive goals. Hitler was also happy when his aggression succeeded. However, Lloyd is not sure whether he has the blessing to be happy. Therefore, he threatened fiercely: "We still have the courage and ability to take action, and it would be wrong to underestimate this if necessary."

Lloyd seems to have forgotten what it was like not being able to sleep all night after the Soviet Union issued a warning. However, it must be admitted that the likes of Lloyd still have some "courage and ability" to continue to act recklessly. But it should also be pointed out that this "courage and ability" does not belong to Britain itself, but is borrowed from the United States. The United States Atlantic Fleet has been dispatched to support the Anglo-French aggressors. "Authoritative sources" in London are also proudly publicizing that "Eden has received some very important guarantees" - as long as Britain announces a ceasefire, "the United States will immediately come to our aid."

"Helping" is naturally a good thing. But when Lloyd is there borrowing the power of others to show off, has he thought about the bill that Britain has to pay to the person who is "helping"?

    评劳埃德的演说
    邢象超
    英、法侵略者和他们的同谋者现在对埃及有些什么打算，从英国外交大臣劳埃德7日晚间的广播演说中可以看得清清楚楚。
    劳埃德照例把英、法侵略埃及说成是为了什么“和平”，但是他也说出了一些真心话。他说，英国之所以“关切”中东，是因为“中东是欧洲、亚洲和非洲之间的通衢要道，它蕴藏着大量的石油资源；它那里有着苏伊士运河”。英国之所以要侵略埃及，就是为了使自己可以千年万世地对这些东西“关切”下去。
    劳埃德不知羞耻地吹嘘侵略埃及的战绩，仿佛以英、法两个大国对付一个埃及，干了这么多天而只占领了塞得港的一部分，还不是什么丢脸的事情。对于劳埃德之流来说，堪以自慰的是他们终于爬上了埃及的海岸，在那里取得了立足点。这就使得他们认为可以用既成事实来进行要挟和威胁，来达到英、法用军事进攻不能达到的目的。
    关于这一点，劳埃德毫不掩饰地说，“我们已经促使联合国面对形势的严酷事实”，“我们用我们的行动，已经成功地制造了一种局势，在这个局势里，有着在联合国的保护下，获得持久的解决的真正希望”。
    劳埃德所要获得持久解决的事情，据他后来说，就是“永久解决中东的事件”，“作出管理苏伊士运河的圆满安排”。换句话说，英国侵略埃及所要达到的目的，就是永远镇压中东的民族独立运动对英国殖民统治的威胁，实现劫夺苏伊士运河的所谓“国际管制”计划。
    劳埃德的所谓“在联合国保护下”来实现这些目的，就是通过联合国紧急部队来做。他提出了这样的要求：联合国部队要“在实质上能够执行我们已经担负起来的任务”，也就是担负占领埃及领土的任务。他说，要是做到了这一点，“那末谁也没有我们那么高兴”。
    当然，侵略者如果达到了自己的侵略目的，无疑会十分高兴。当年希特勒在侵略得手的时候，也是曾经高兴过的。不过，劳埃德对于有没有福气高兴，却还是没有把握。因此，他恶狠狠地威胁说：“我们还是有勇气和能力来采取行动，如果有必要的话，低估这一点将是错误的。”
    劳埃德好像已经忘记在苏联提出警告以后一夜没有睡觉的滋味了。不过，应当承认，劳埃德之流现在还有些继续蛮干的“勇气和能力”。可是也应当指出，这种“勇气和能力”不是英国自己的，而是从美国那里借来的。美国的大西洋舰队已经出动来给英、法侵略者撑腰。伦敦的“权威人士”也在不无得意地宣传说，“艾登已经得到某些非常重要的保证”——只要英国宣布停火，“美国将立刻来帮我们的忙”。
    “帮忙”自然是好事情。可是，当劳埃德在那里借着别人的势头神气活现的时候，他想到了英国要付给“帮忙”的人的账单没有？
