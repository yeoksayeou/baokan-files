Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 29th. The Harbin Electric Meter Instrument Factory has gradually increased production based on strict requirements for product quality.

The newly built Harbin Electric Meter Instrument Factory encountered difficulties in production after its launch because the preparatory work before production had not been properly done. In the face of numerous difficulties, the factory still strictly demanded product quality, conscientiously implemented process regulations, and laid the foundation for regular production. For example, when the factory trial-produced the first batch of Model 201 AC switchboard instruments in May, the hardness of the pivots was required to be 59 to 60 degrees according to regulations, but the actual hardness they produced was 58 degrees. Some people advocated using them, but in order to strictly abide by the process regulations and improve the technical level, the factory scrapped all of these more than 1,000 substandard pivots. The factory then mobilized workers and technicians to conduct research, and found that the reason for the insufficient hardness of the pivots was that the temperature during the heat treatment process was not well controlled. After improvement, not only did the quality of this instrument meet the design standards, but also the output reached the designed production capacity in November.

In recent months, the production of another product - automobile instruments - has also continuously increased output while ensuring quality.

At present, the employees of the Harbin Electric Meter Instrument Factory have mastered the production technology of Model 201 AC switchboard instruments, automobile instruments, and some other products.

### 宁将次品作为废品也绝不放宽质量标准尺度  电表厂坚持先保证质量再增产

    宁将次品作为废品也绝不放宽质量标准尺度
    电表厂坚持先保证质量再增产
    新华社哈尔滨29日电　哈尔滨电表仪器厂在严格要求产品质量的基础上，逐步提高了产量。
    新建的哈尔滨电表仪器厂由于生产前的准备工作没有做好，投入生产以后的生产情况是不顺利的。在重重的困难面前，这个厂仍然严格要求产品质量，认真贯彻执行工艺规程，为正规生产打下基础。例如工厂在5月份第一批试制成功的二零一型交流开关板仪表，在成批生产的时候，轴尖的硬度按规定需要五十九度到六十度，他们做出的是五十八度。有人主张使用，但是工厂为了严格遵守工艺规程，提高技术水平，还是把这批一千多个没有达到标准的轴尖全部作废了。工厂接着发动工人技术人员进行研究，结果发现轴尖硬度不够的原因是热处理过程中的温度没有掌握好。经过改进以后，现在这种仪表不仅质量达到设计标准，而且产量也在11月份达到了设计生产能力。
    几个月来，另一种产品——汽车仪表的生产也在保证质量的基础上不断提高了产量。
    目前，哈尔滨电表仪器厂的职工已经掌握了二零一型交流开关板仪表和汽车仪表以及其他一些产品的生产技术。
