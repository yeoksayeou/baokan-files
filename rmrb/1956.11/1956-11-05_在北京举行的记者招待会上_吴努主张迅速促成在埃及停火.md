Xinhua News Agency, 4th - At a press conference held in Beijing today, the President of the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League of Burma, Wu Nu, said, "A ceasefire in Egypt should be rapidly brought about, and then we should try to bring about a peaceful resolution." Chairman Wu Nu made these remarks when answering questions about the Anglo-French invasion of Egypt at a press conference held here this morning.
    The President of the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League of Burma told Chinese and foreign reporters, "As a man of peace, I do not like fighting under any circumstances."
    He said that this issue "should be submitted to the United Nations as quickly as possible."
    When a reporter asked this initiator of the Bandung Conference and former Prime Minister of Burma whether he thought the Anglo-French invasion of Egypt violated the Bandung spirit, he said, "Of course, the Bandung Conference advocates peace. Any fighting anywhere violates its spirit."
    Chairman Wu Nu said that convening another Asian-African conference to discuss this issue would be a good idea.
    In a statement he issued, Chairman Wu Nu told Chinese and foreign reporters in Beijing that he had held many frank talks with Chinese leaders on the Sino-Burmese border issue and that the "final solution is in sight." Wu Nu said, "When we came here, we thought there would be countless difficulties, but when discussing various issues on the basis of the Five Principles agreed upon by Premier Zhou Enlai and myself, we found that the difficulties were not insurmountable."
    The President of the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League of Burma, who will return home tomorrow, said, "We are taking the opinions of the Chinese government back with us" and hope that soon we will be able to tell the world that this issue has been resolved to the satisfaction of both sides."
    Chairman Wu Nu believes that the prospects for Sino-Burmese friendship are "very bright." He said that he and Premier Zhou Enlai are trying to establish "a new kind of relationship" in the field of diplomatic relations. He said that under normal circumstances, in the field of diplomatic relations, leaders meet like diplomats, talk in a diplomatic manner, and issue diplomatic statements.
    He said: "But your Premier and I have been very successful in establishing a new relationship free from hypocrisy. We talk very frankly about various different issues. If we agree, we openly express our agreement, and if we disagree, we agree on this disagreement." "The relationship between Premier Zhou Enlai and myself can be said to be a relationship between two brothers rather than between two diplomats or politicians."
    When a reporter asked Chairman Wu Nu about his impressions of his third visit to China, he said, "Every time I come here, I see changes, and these changes are very rapid and astonishing." He said that wherever he went, "I saw new factories emerging and new buildings being built for workers and farmers to use. I am very impressed by what I have seen." He expects that China's major cities will "become completely unrecognizable" in five years.

    在北京举行的记者招待会上
    吴努主张迅速促成在埃及停火
    新华社4日讯　缅甸联邦反法西斯人民自由同盟主席吴努今天说，“应当迅速促成在埃及的停火，然后我们应当设法促成和平解决。”吴努主席是在今天上午在这里举行的记者招待会上答复英法侵略埃及的问题时说这番话的。
    这位缅甸反法西斯人民自由同盟主席告诉中外记者说：“作为一个和平的人，我在任何情况下都不喜欢战斗。”
    他说，这个问题“应当尽速提交联合国”。
    有记者问这位万隆会议发起人之一、前缅甸总理，他是否认为英法对埃及的侵略违反了万隆精神，他说：“当然，万隆会议主张和平。任何地方的任何战斗都是违反它的精神的。”
    吴努主席说，召开另一次亚非会议来讨论这个问题是一个好主意。
    吴努主席在他发表的一篇声明中告诉北京的中外记者，他就中缅边界问题同中国领袖们举行了多次坦率的会谈，这个问题的“最后解决已经在望”。吴努说，“我们到这里来时以为将有无数的困难，但是在周恩来总理和我所赞同的五项原则的基础上讨论各项问题时我们发现困难不是不可克服的。”
    这位缅甸反法西斯人民自由同盟主席将在明天回国，他说，“我们带着中国政府的意见回去”，希望不久我们就将能够告诉全世界这个问题已经在双方满意的情况下解决了。”
    吴努主席认为中缅友谊的前景“非常光明”。他说，他正在和周恩来总理一起试图在外交关系的领域中建立“一种新关系”。他说，在通常情况下，在外交关系领域中，领袖们像外交人员一样会晤，以一种外交方式交谈和发表外交的声明。
    他说：“但是你们的总理和我自己在建立一种没有虚伪的新关系方面一直是非常成功的。我们非常坦率地就各种不同问题进行会谈。如果我们意见一致的话，我们公开地表示意见一致，如果我们意见不一致的话，我们就同意这种不一致。”“周恩来总理和我之间的关系，可以说是两个兄弟之间的关系而不是两个外交人员或政界人士之间的关系。”
    有记者问吴努主席对第三次访问中国的印象，他说：“我每一次到这里来都看到了变化，而这些变化是非常迅速和惊人的。”他说，他不论到什么地方，“都看到出现了新工厂和建立了供工人和农民使用的新建筑。我对我所看到的情况印象非常深刻。”他预期中国的大城市在五年以后“将变得完全认不出来”。
