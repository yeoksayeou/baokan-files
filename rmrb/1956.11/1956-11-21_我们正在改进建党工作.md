Response to Criticism

    We Are Improving Party Building Work
    Letter from the CCP Shanxi Yuci Jinhua Textile Factory Committee: In the letter from a Party member published on page 4 of the People's Daily on August 24, criticism was made of our factory's Party Committee's tendency towards closed-doorism in party building. We have examined this issue and taken concrete measures to actively overcome shortcomings in party building work. We have already formulated a party building plan, cultivated party building targets, trained party building organizers, and are actively carrying out this work. We are also working hard to resolve the issue of probationary party members' becoming full members.
