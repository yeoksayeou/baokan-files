    Soldiers' Dance: "Morning in the Barracks" Composer: Bordo Kapor Choreographer: Sasdi Laszlo, Selelyi Laszlo Performed by: Dance Team Performers: Quartermaster: Ats Joseph Recruit: Nepp Laszlo.
    The dance depicts a new recruit who is not yet accustomed to military life, still sleeping when others get up in the morning. He is late for morning exercises, breakfast, and roll call. His comrades help him correct his shortcomings with good-natured teasing. This dance is very vivid and full of dramatic elements. The solo dancer excellently creates the image of the squad leader, and the recruit is also performed very adorably.
    Chorus: "Join Our Ranks" Composer: Koshut Prize Winner Ference Ferkos Lead Singer: Kovacs Janos
    Hungarian Ancient Folk Song Soloist: Beresh Ference
    "Porcelain Jar Dance" Composer: Uychichi Dihomir Choreographer: Seki Joseph Performed by: Dance Team Female Performers
    The "Porcelain Jar Dance," like the "Bottle Dance" that has already been introduced to our country, is enthusiastically welcomed by the people. This dance begins with sweet and touching dance movements. A group of beautiful girls dance and sing while holding porcelain jars, as if they were celestial maidens, and people greet them with envious eyes.
    "Rakoczy March" Composer: Berlioz Conductor: Gereges Janos Rakoczy was a hero who led the Hungarian people in a war of independence against Austrian rule in the early eighteenth century.
    "Gorotsagi Dance" Composer: Grieg Peter Choreographer: Sasdi Laszlo, Selelyi Laszlo Performed by: Dance Team Soloist: Molnar Lajos
    Opera "Hunyadi Laszlo" Selection: Lagranzh Aria Composer: Ariel Soloist: Agai Lolau
    Folk Instrument Performance: "Recruiting Song" Conductor: Bocic Sandor
    The "Invitation Dance" depicts the scene of a rural dance party, presenting a humorous scene of Hungarian village life to the audience.

    After the first performance of the Hungarian People's Army Song and Dance Ensemble in Beijing, literary and art workers in the capital went on stage to present flowers and take a group photo. All photos on this page are taken by reporters of this newspaper.

    匈牙利人民军文工团在北京首次演出
    吉普赛舞（速写）　苗　地
    邀请舞（速写）　刘勃舒
    合唱：“热情之歌”
    士兵舞：“兵营里的早晨”　作曲：波尔多·卡波尔　编舞：萨斯地·拉斯洛，塞莱吉·拉斯洛　表演者：舞蹈队　扮演者：司务长：阿茨·约瑟夫　新兵：耐泼·拉斯洛。
    舞蹈是描写一个刚入伍的新兵，他还不习惯部队生活，早晨别人起了床，他还睡觉。早操、早饭、早点名，样样都迟到。战友们用善意的嘲笑帮助他改正缺点。这个舞蹈很生动，富有戏剧情节，独舞者杰出地创造了班长的形象，新兵演得也很可爱。
    合唱：“参加我们的队伍”作曲：柯树特奖金获得者　弗尔哥士·费伦茨　领唱：戈瓦奇·扬努士
    匈牙利古代民歌独唱者：贝莱什·菲伦茨
    “瓷罐舞”　作曲：乌依契奇·第好美尔　编舞：赛基·约瑟夫
　表演者：舞蹈队女演员
    “瓷罐舞”和早已被介绍到我国来的“瓶舞”一样，受到人们热情的欢迎。这个舞蹈是以甜美动人心弦的舞姿开始的。一群美丽的姑娘持着瓷罐歌舞，好像是人间的仙女，人们都以羡慕的眼光来迎接她们。
    “拉果吉进行曲”　作曲：柏辽兹　指挥：盖莱盖什·亚诺士拉果吉是十八世纪初领导匈牙利人民进行自由战争、反对奥地利统治的英雄。
    “戈罗特萨吉舞”　作曲：戈列格·彼得　编舞：萨斯地·拉斯洛，塞莱吉·拉斯洛　表演者：舞蹈队　独舞者：莫尔那·劳约什
    歌剧“胡扬第·拉斯洛”选曲：拉格兰什咏叹调　作曲：阿里凯尔　独唱：阿高伊·洛劳
    民间乐器演奏：“募兵曲”　指挥：包契克·山道尔
    “邀请舞”是表现农村舞会的情形，在观众眼前，展示了一幅一幅风趣的匈牙利乡村生活场景。
