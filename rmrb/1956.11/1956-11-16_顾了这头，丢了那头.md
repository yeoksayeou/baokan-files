　　Not long ago, Shanlian Agricultural Cooperative of Shanqian Township, Wuxi County, made a regulation: if a member's chickens and ducks damaged crops in the fields, they would receive education the first time, criticism the second time, and the chickens and ducks would be killed the third time. The cooperative, fearing that members would be too embarrassed to do it themselves, also put forward slogans such as "Killing a chicken earns two work points" and "Whoever kills it eats it" to encourage people to kill chickens. Under this encouragement, the cooperative has already killed ten chickens.

　　Perhaps some people think that although killing chickens is wrong, using this method to prohibit chickens and ducks from going to the fields is also based on protecting production. These people forget that members raising chickens and ducks is also for the development of production! Is damaging this kind of production to protect that kind of production a good method? If we don't adopt the method of killing, is there no other way to protect farmland?

　　If only one agricultural cooperative issued this kind of ban, the problem would not be serious. What is surprising is that many counties north and south of the Yangtze River in Jiangsu Province have some agricultural cooperatives that have issued similar "bans." Zong Changfu, the deputy director of the No. 1 Cooperative of Huayang Township, Jiangdu County, told the members that whoever caught a duck in the cooperative's rice paddy would be rewarded with two work points, which would be paid by the duck raiser. "Heavy rewards will surely bring forth brave men," and members Xu Ennian and others were busy working in the fields, while keeping an eye out for ducks. Before long, they caught six ducks and earned twelve work points. The chief accountant, Xu Wenjiang, had six ducks at home and was afraid that they would swim into the paddy fields and be caught, so he sent his eleven-year-old daughter to watch them. The child was playful, and the ducks could walk on land and swim in water, swimming to the rice paddy on the west side of the river. At this time, the little girl was anxious and rowed a boat across the river to chase them. When the boat reached the middle of the river, she used too much force and broke the oar rope. The child fell into the water and died. Perhaps this was unexpected by the people who issued the "ban," but one sentence from the cooperative cadres can have such a big impact!

　　Perhaps some people think that failing to meet the agricultural production increase target is a big deal, and the sideline production of the members' families is a "small matter." Little do they know that these small things are the root of big things, and "small things" can also cause big mistakes. If members can't even raise chickens and ducks, what will they think of the cooperative?

　　As far as I know, the leading organs of Jiangsu Province have not issued an order to "prohibit raising chickens and ducks." On the contrary, relevant leading organs have also issued instructions encouraging members to raise more chickens and ducks individually. However, some grassroots cadres do not have a deep understanding of the relationship between the personal interests of the peasants and the collective interests. They do not understand what should be done and what should not be done, and thus this strange ban has appeared.

    顾了这头，丢了那头
    姚世夫
    不久以前，无锡县山前乡山联农业社作出一项规定：如果社员的鸡鸭到田里损坏庄稼，一次教育，二次批评，三次就要把鸡鸭打死。社里怕社员放不下情面，又提出“打死一只鸡，记二分工”，“谁打死谁吃”等口号来鼓励人打鸡。在这种鼓舞下，这个社已经打死了十只鸡。
    也许有人认为，打死鸡虽然不对，但是用这种办法来禁止鸡鸭下田，也是从保护生产出发的。这些人忘记了社员饲养鸡鸭也是为的发展生产啊！损坏这种生产来保护那种生产，这是一种什么办法呢？不采用打死的办法，是否就没有别的办法来保护农田了呢？
    如果只有一个农业社发布这种禁令，问题还不算严重，令人惊异的是：江苏省长江南北的不少县份，都有一些农业社发布过这种类似的“禁令”。江都县华扬乡一社副主任宗长福向社员说，谁到社里秧田里捉一只鸭子，赏他两个工分，工分由养鸭户出。“重赏之下必有勇夫”，社员徐恩年等八人在田里，手里忙做活，眼观四方找鸭子，不一会就捉到六只鸭子，得了十二个工分。总会计徐文江家里有六只鸭子，怕游过稻田被捉，就打发十一岁的女孩去看。小孩子贪玩，而鸭子是出水能走，入水能游，一游游到河西的秧田里。这时小女孩心中着急，划船过河去赶。船到河中，用劲过猛，轧断了桨绳，小孩落水而死。也许这是出乎发布“禁令”的人的意外吧，可是社干部的一句话，会发生多么大的影响！
    或许有人认为，完不成农业增产指标是大事，社员家庭副业生产是“小事”。殊不知这些小事却是大事的根，“小事”同样也会铸成大错；社员连个鸡鸭也不能养了，他对合作社将会有些什么感觉呢？
    据我所知，江苏省的领导机关，并没发布“禁养鸡鸭”的命令；相反的，有关领导机关还曾经发出指示，鼓励社员个人多养鸡鸭。但是有些基层干部没有深刻认识农民的个人利益和集体利益的关系，他们不了解什么是应该做的，什么是不应该做的，因而就出现了这种奇怪的禁令。
