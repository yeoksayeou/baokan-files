    Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 16th: The reconstructed "August 1st" Bridge in Nanchang City, which began construction last November, opened to traffic on the 15th.
    The bridge is 1,077 meters long and spans the Gan River. It is a major highway in Nanchang City connecting the eastern and western halves of Jiangxi Province. According to statistics from relevant departments, more than one million vehicles of various types and more than two and a half million pedestrians passed through the bridge each year in the past. However, because it had a wooden deck, its load-bearing capacity and driving speed were limited. Now that it has been converted into a reinforced concrete highway bridge, it can handle heavy vehicles. The driving speed can also be increased six times compared to the past. The successful reconstruction of the bridge will provide excellent conditions for the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas within Jiangxi Province.

    改建的“八一”桥通车
    据新华社南昌16日电　去年11月间动工改建的南昌市“八一”大桥已经在15日开始通车。
    这座大桥全长一千零七十七公尺，横跨赣江，是在南昌市连通江西东半部和西半部的公路要道。据有关部门统计，过去每年通过这座大桥的有一百万多辆各种车辆和二百五十多万行人。但是因为是木板桥面，载重量和行车速度都要受一定限制。现在改成为一座钢筋混凝土结构的公路桥以后，可以通过重型汽车。汽车行车速度也可以比过去提高六倍。这座大桥的改建成功将给江西省内城乡物资交流提供很好的条件。
