Leading Personnel Give Up Housing

    (Report from our station in Xinjiang) The exploration teams searching for oil treasures in the Junggar and Tarim Basins have long lived a nomadic tent life. In order to provide housing for these young men and women who have endured hardship when they return from the field, the Xinjiang Petroleum Administration built several dormitories this year. However, these dormitories are far from enough to accommodate all the exploration team members. Recently, the Xinjiang Petroleum Administration established a housing adjustment team. Responsible personnel at all levels responded to the call of the administration and the Party, and voluntarily gave up their housing. In this way, everyone has a place to live.

    领导人员让房子
    本报讯　在准噶尔和塔里木盆地寻找石油宝藏的勘测队员，长期过着流动的帐篷生活。新疆石油管理局为了让这些备尝艰苦的青年男女，从野外归来时住上房屋，今年曾建筑了几栋宿舍。但是，这些宿舍还远不能容纳全部勘测队员。最近，新疆石油管理局成立了调整住房小组，各级负责工作人员响应了行政和党的号召，纷纷让出了自己的住房。这样，大家都有房子住了。　（新疆记者站）
