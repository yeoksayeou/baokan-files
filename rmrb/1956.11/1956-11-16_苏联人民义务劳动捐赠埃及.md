Moscow Dispatch from Our Newspaper, November 15th—The Soviet people are enthusiastically supporting the Egyptian people's war against the aggression of Britain, France, and Israel. In recent days, factories, enterprises, and collective farms throughout the Soviet Union have held mass rallies, unanimously demanding a complete halt to the war of aggression and the withdrawal of foreign troops from Egypt. To support the Egyptian people's struggle, workers in factories and enterprises throughout the Soviet Union have voluntarily proposed working overtime for two hours, donating all income to the fund to support the Egyptian people. On November 13th, workers at the Sverdlov Silk Factory in Moscow, who were originally scheduled to leave work two hours early before the holiday, did not leave the factory. Thousands of workers continued to produce actively, resulting in one million rubles to support the Egyptian people. Workers at the "Three Hills" Textile Factory in Moscow worked overtime for two hours and donated all their income, 100,000 rubles, to the Egyptian people. Workers at the Moscow Nochkin Hosiery Factory, the Moscow Automated Glass Manufacturing Factory, and others responded to the call of the trade union, worked overtime, and supported the Egyptian people. Some shop assistants in Moscow and more than 650 textile salespersons in Kyiv will work overtime for two hours on Saturday, donating their income to support Egypt.
