Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, November 28th: The Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party is currently reorganizing its structure and has begun re-registering members.

Currently, temporary party leadership bodies have been established in Budapest and most of the country's provinces and districts. Temporary party committees have been formed in various districts of Budapest and in many enterprises. In the locations of party headquarters in various provinces and districts, former Working People's Party organizations and members have successively held meetings to establish temporary party committees. In Szabolcs-Szatmár-Bereg County, 60% of the former Working People's Party members attended the county's party organization meeting, and most of them expressed their agreement with the goals of the Socialist Workers' Party. In Veszprém County, a temporary executive committee of the party has been established, and some of its members are highly respected figures in the community. Temporary party committees have also been established in many rural areas. Honest Working People's Party members are actively participating in the reorganization of the party. Conscious workers and agricultural cooperative members have expressed their willingness to join the party.

However, the work of building the party in various places has also encountered certain difficulties and obstacles. Due to the terror and sabotage activities of counter-revolutionary elements in the past period, the Working People's Party organizations in many areas have suffered losses. At present, most grassroots branch organizations have not yet been established. According to "People's Freedom," terrorists are still active in some provinces, threatening those who want to join the party. Some Working People's Party members are still afraid to admit that they are members, and some are still waiting to see what happens.

On the 24th, "People's Freedom" published the Socialist Workers' Party Executive Committee's temporary guidelines for admitting party members. On the 25th, the newspaper published an editorial entitled "Organize the Party." The editorial stated that the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party is a Marxist-Leninist party. In this party, theory and action cannot be separated. The party should be closely linked to the masses, especially the working class, on the basis of the most advanced theory (Marxism-Leninism), and at the same time lead the masses. We believe that the best members of the working people will be in the party. The new party will be able to fulfill its mission of leading workers and working people in building socialism.

Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, November 28th: Members of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party in Budapest have begun to take active action.

On November 25th, the Budapest Executive Committee of the Socialist Workers' Party convened a meeting of district activists in Kispest to discuss the party's current tasks.

Károly Kiss participated in the meeting and clarified the current tasks of party members. Kiss believes that the most important thing now is to get rid of the negative emotions that still affect many people. He said: We must act frankly, sincerely, and resolutely. We should reorganize our party organizations. We should start production.

He emphasized that we must pay attention to those who are trying to split the party by labeling many party members as "Rákosi elements," wanting us to abandon all those who have held positions in past political and economic life.

More than a dozen people spoke at the meeting. They all pointed out that the strike has caused huge losses to the country, and only those agitators are demanding to continue the work stoppage. Although this kind of person only accounts for a small number, the problem is that party members have not waged a resolute and tough struggle against them. Now, the party should stand up openly and let the entire working class see, "We are here, we are working, don't be afraid, because we are fighting for the truth."

Party activists on Csepel Island also held a meeting on the same day. The meeting participants unanimously agreed that in order to ensure the socialist system, it is necessary to completely eliminate counter-revolutionary elements and punish the people's mortal enemies, executioners, and terrorists according to law.

The meeting also believed that the unity of the party should be strengthened, the relationship between the party and the masses should be closer, and workers' pickets should be organized in factories as soon as possible to ensure the safe production of factories.

    匈牙利社会主义工人党开始整顿组织
    布达佩斯党组织召开积极分子会议讨论当前任务
    新华社布达佩斯28日电　匈牙利社会主义工人党目前正在重新整顿组织，开始重新登记党员。
    现在，布达佩斯市和国内大部分州、区已经建立了党的临时领导机构。布达佩斯各个区和许多企业中已经成立了党的临时委员会。在各个州和区的党部所在地，前劳动人民党的组织和党员相继举行了会议，来建立党的临时委员会。在萨伯尔齐—沙特马尔州，有60％的前劳动人民党党员参加了这个州的党组织的会议，其中大部分党员表示同意社会主义工人党的奋斗目标。维斯普雷姆州已经成立了党的临时执行委员会，其中有些委员都是在群众中很受尊敬的人物。有不少农村也建立了党的临时委员会。正直的劳动人民党党员积极地参加了整顿党组织的活动。有觉悟的工人、农业生产合作社社员都表示愿意加入党。
    但是，各地的建党工作也碰到一定的困难和阻碍。由于过去一个时期反革命分子的恐怖和破坏活动，不少地区的劳动人民党组织受到了损失。目前，基层支部组织大都还没有建立起来。据“人民自由报”报道，在一些州里，恐怖分子仍然在活动，他们威胁那些想加入党的人们。有些劳动人民党党员至今还不敢承认自己是党员，有些人还在观望。
    “人民自由报”在24日刊载了社会主义工人党执行委员会关于吸收党员的临时方针。25日，这个报纸发表了一篇题为“把党组织起来”的社论。社论说，匈牙利社会主义工人党是马克思列宁主义的政党。在这个党内，理论和行动不能互相脱离。党应当在最先进的理论（马克思列宁主义）的基础上紧密地同群众联系，同时也要领导群众，首先是工人阶级。我们相信，党内将会有劳动人民中最优秀的分子。新的党将能够完成领导工人和劳动人民建设社会主义的使命。
    新华社布达佩斯28日电　布达佩斯的匈牙利社会主义工人党党员开始积极行动起来了。
    11月25日，社会主义工人党布达佩斯执行委员会在小佩斯召集了区的积极分子大会，讨论了党的当前的任务。
    卡罗利·基什参加了这个大会，并且在会上阐明了党员当前的任务。基什认为，现在最重要的是摆脱还影响着很多人的那种消极情绪。他说：我们要坦率、真诚，并且坚决地行动起来。我们应当重新组织我们的党组织。我们应当开始生产。
    他强调指出，必须注意有些人企图分裂党，他们硬给许多党员扣上“拉科西分子”的帽子，想使我们抛弃所有那些在过去政治和经济生活中担任过职务的人。
    会上，有十多个人讲了话。他们都指出：罢工给国家造成了巨大的损失，只有那些煽动分子要求继续停工。这种人虽然只占少数，但是问题在于党员没有向他们进行坚决强硬的斗争。现在，党应当公开地站出来，让整个工人阶级都看到“我们在这里，我们在工作着，不要害怕，因为我们是为真理而进行斗争。”
    切佩尔岛的党积极分子也在同一天举行了会议。会议参加者一致认为，为了确保社会主义制度，必须全部消灭反革命分子，依法惩处人民的死敌、刽子手和恐怖分子。
    会议还认为，应当加强党的团结，密切党和群众的关系，并且应当在工厂中赶快组织工人纠察队，以保证工厂的安全生产。
