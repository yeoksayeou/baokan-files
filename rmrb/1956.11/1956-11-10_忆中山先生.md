    Remembering Mr. Sun Yat-sen
    Ma Xiang

    The first time I met Mr. Sun Yat-sen was in a place on the border between the United States and Mexico—also known as Yécáibǎo. This place is not large, but many overseas Chinese live here. On the night Mr. Sun Yat-sen came, some young people like me, seventeen or eighteen years old, went to the Chee Kung Tong to listen to Mr. Sun Yat-sen's speech. He didn't speak much, but his impassioned speech deeply moved me. After the speech, I walked up to Mr. Sun Yat-sen and asked him, "Would it be okay if I joined you in the revolution?" "Do you, as a child, have the courage? Revolution requires bloodshed and sacrifice!" "As long as I follow you, Mr. Sun, I'm not afraid of being smashed to pieces!" "If you have the ambition, I can write you a letter of introduction. Go to Japan. When you get to Japan, look for Chen Shaobai, Liao Zhongkai, and Zhu Zhixin. They will definitely arrange work for you."

    Not long after, I joined the Overseas Chinese Volunteer Army and took a boat back to China from Vancouver, Canada. When the ship arrived in Japan, Zhu Zhixin and Chen Shaobai met us and took us ashore. We received military training in Japan. There were more than 300 of us from all walks of life, including waiters from restaurants, farm workers, and hunters. Because everyone was so enthusiastic, we mastered military techniques in just five months.

    In the 6th year of the Republic of China (1917), when the ship arrived in Shanghai, Mr. Sun Yat-sen personally held a meeting in Zhang Garden to welcome us. He said that overseas Chinese are the mother of the revolution, and without the support and sponsorship of overseas Chinese, it would have been difficult to achieve today's success. At that time, the situation was relatively tense, and in order to protect Mr. Sun Yat-sen's safety, Zhu Zhixin selected me to be Mr. Sun Yat-sen's bodyguard. From then on, I had the opportunity to be close to Mr. Sun Yat-sen.

    Mr. Sun Yat-sen was very eager to learn. Apart from dealing with official business and meeting with guests during the day, he was always reading. Sometimes, in order to collect materials, he would wear black cloth shoes, hold a cane, and walk from Huanlong Road all the way to the old bookstores on North Sichuan Road to buy books. If he bought too many books, he would hire a horse-drawn carriage to bring them back.

    Mr. Sun Yat-sen was also very good at arranging his days off. Once, for a vacation, he specially invited Chen Shaobai and a few others to travel to Hangzhou. When he arrived in Hangzhou, he stayed at a friend's house. The Hangzhou Police Department learned that Mr. Sun Yat-sen had arrived and hurriedly sent several policemen to protect him. Mr. Sun Yat-sen jokingly said, "Why don't you even let me have a good rest? I'm just an ordinary person. Why make such a fuss? Go back! Don't come again in the future." During this holiday, he enjoyed himself to the fullest.

    On another occasion in Guangzhou, some overseas Chinese and Hong Kong capitalists (who had helped Mr. Sun Yat-sen's revolution in the past) visited Mr. Sun Yat-sen at the base camp. Mr. Sun Yat-sen invited them to visit Dinghu Mountain. Madame Sun and Madame Wei Bangping sat under a tree talking, while Mr. Sun Yat-sen and those overseas Chinese swam under the waterfall. After swimming, he squatted by the water to wash his underwear and clothes. I rushed to wash them for him, but he said, "Can't I do it? I can wash them cleaner than you!"

    In the past, we overseas Chinese contributed money when we had it and effort when we didn't, supporting Mr. Sun Yat-sen's revolution, hoping for a prosperous and strong motherland. Now, Mr. Sun Yat-sen's ideals have been realized one by one. We want to tell Mr. Sun Yat-sen that we will certainly inherit your legacy and build our motherland into a strong and prosperous nation.

    忆中山先生
    马湘
    我第一次会见中山先生，是在美国和墨西哥交界的地方——也梳。这个地方并不大，可是有很多华侨聚居在这里。中山先生来的那天晚上，我和些十七、八岁的青年都到致公堂听中山先生演讲。他讲得并不很多，但是他那激愤的演词，使我很受感动。讲演完毕后，我走向中山先生问他：“我跟你参加革命好吗？”“你这小孩子有胆量吗？闹革命要流血、要牺牲的啊！”“只要跟着先生，我粉身碎骨也不怕！”“要是你有志气的话，我可以写封介绍信，你去日本，到了日本去找陈少白、廖仲恺、朱执信，他们一定会给你安排工作。”
    以后不久，我就参加了华侨义勇军，从加拿大温哥华搭船回国。船到日本时，由朱执信、陈少白接我们登岸，在日本受军事训练。我们一起三百多人是来自各行各业的，有餐馆里的服务员，农场的工人、猎手，由于大家的情绪很高，仅仅训练了五个月，便掌握了军事技术。
    民国6年，船到上海，中山先生亲自在张园开会欢迎我们。他说华侨乃革命之母，没有华侨的支持、赞助，很难有今天的成功，当时形势比较紧张，朱执信为了保护中山先生的安全，便挑选了我出来当中山先生的警卫员。从此我便有机缘与中山先生接近。
    中山先生非常好学。除了日中处理一些公事，和会见一些客人之外，常是手不释卷。有时为了搜集材料，他穿上黑布鞋，手持拐杖由环龙路一直步行到北四川路的旧书摊里买书。书买得太多了，就雇一部马车拉回来。
    中山先生也很会安排他休息的日子。有一次休假，他为了好好地玩玩，特地约了陈少白几个人到杭州旅行。到了杭州他住在一个朋友家里，杭州警察局知道中山先生来了，赶忙派了几个警察来保护。中山先生打趣地说：“为什么我连休息你们都不让我好好地过，我也不过是一个普通的人，何必搞得大惊小怪，快回去吧！以后不要再来。”在这假期中，他尽情地去游玩。
    另外有一次在广州，有一些华侨和香港的资本家（过去曾帮助中山先生革命），到大本营访问中山先生。中山先生邀请他们去游鼎湖山，孙夫人和魏邦平夫人坐在树下谈话，中山先生和那些华侨在瀑布下游泳，游完之后，自己蹲在水旁洗底衣底袂，我抢着要替他洗，他说“我不会吗？我洗得比你清洁一些吧！”
    过去我们华侨有钱出钱，无钱出力，支持中山先生的革命，为的是希望有一个繁荣富强的祖国。现在，中山先生的理想一一实现了。我们要告慰中山先生，我们一定秉承你的遗志，把祖国建设得又富又强。
