Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot. Visiting groups of ethnic minorities organized by various regions of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region to inspect the implementation of ethnic policies have recently concluded their visiting activities.

Through visits to various ethnic minorities, the visiting groups in various regions have helped solve and understand many current problems in production and life. In Hulunbuir, Jirem, Zhaowuda, and other leagues where ethnic minorities are concentrated, after the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region visiting group visited more than 20 banners, counties, and cities, it promptly provided more than 273,000 yuan in subsidies to ethnic minority households with difficulties in production and life. After more than 700 Hui farmers who moved from Shandong Province to Arong Banner and other places in Hulunbuir League received subsidies, more than 80% of the Hui people added cotton-padded clothes and quilts, and those who were originally uneasy about production are now settled. During the visit to the Daur and Solon ethnic minorities living in mountainous areas, 9,600 sick people were given free treatment. Subsidies were also allocated to areas with poor equipment in mountain primary schools. When the visiting group visited more than 40 Solon herdsmen living in Hui Sumu, Solon Banner, they learned that after they switched from agriculture and forestry to animal husbandry in 1954, their lives became difficult due to their weak financial base and the cessation of sideline production. This time, they were subsidized with food and livestock worth more than 4,000 yuan.

Visiting groups were also organized in Pingdiquan and Hetao Administrative Regions in western Inner Mongolia to visit scattered ethnic minorities door-to-door, helping some agricultural and pastoral cooperatives to reduce the income of ethnic minority members. According to their production specialties, new production arrangements were made in many aspects. Living allowances were also given to widowed, orphaned, and childless ethnic minority members who had lost their labor ability.

Through extensive discussions and understanding with various ethnic minorities, the visiting groups organized in various regions discovered that relevant leading departments have a tendency to neglect the characteristics of local ethnic groups in guiding the development of production. In leading the production of the Oroqen and Daur ethnic minorities in remote mountainous areas, there is a lack of comprehensive planning and specific measures. Issues such as how to calculate the distribution of income for production cooperatives that combine agriculture and hunting, joint multi-ethnic cooperatives that operate dry land and paddy fields, and mountain construction have not been resolved for a long time. Scattered ethnic minorities in the western region have reduced their income after joining agricultural cooperatives due to their unfamiliarity with production and the low valuation of livestock entering the cooperatives. During the visit, the visiting groups also widely solicited opinions and requirements from various ethnic minorities on the development of production, and are preparing to report the discovered problems to the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China for resolution.

    内蒙古各地少数民族访问团结束访问活动
    在访问中了解了少数民族对发展生产的要求，并且帮助解决了生产和生活上的不少困难
    新华社呼和浩特讯　内蒙古自治区各地在检查民族政策执行情况中组织的少数民族访问团，最近已结束了访问活动。
    各地访问团通过对各少数民族的访问，帮助解决和了解到不少当前生产生活上存在的问题，在少数民族聚居较集中的呼伦贝尔、哲里木和昭乌达等盟，经过内蒙古自治区访问团访问的二十多个旗、县、市，对各少数民族在生产和生活上发现的困难户，及时给了二十七万三千多元的补助。今年从山东省移往呼伦贝尔盟阿荣旗等地的七百多户回族农民得到补助后，80％以上的回民添缝了棉衣和棉被，原来不安心生产的现在也安心了。对居住在山区的达呼尔和索伦等少数民族，访问中还给九千六百名生病的人免费治疗。对山区小学设备较差的地区，也拨发了补助费。访问团在访问索伦旗辉苏木居住的四十多户索伦族牧民时，了解到他们在1954年从经营农业和林业转向牧业生产后，因家底薄和断绝了副业生产，生活发生困难，这次补助了价值四千多元的口粮和牲畜。
    内蒙古西部平地泉和河套行政区等地也组织了访问团，对散居的少数民族挨门逐户的进行访问，帮助有些农牧业社要减少收入的少数民族社员，根据他们的生产特长，重新从多方面进行了生产上的安排。对鳏寡孤独失去劳动力的少数民族社员，也给予生活补助费。
    各地组织的访问团，通过对各少数民族的广泛座谈了解，发现有关领导部门在领导发展生产上有不少地方存在忽视当地民族特点的倾向。在领导边沿山区鄂伦春和达呼尔等少数民族生产上，缺乏全面规划和具体措施。对农业和猎业结合的生产合作社，经营旱田、水田的多民族联合社，如何计算收益分配，有关山区建设等问题，长期没有解决。散居在西部地区的少数民族，在加入农业社后由于生产不熟悉，牲畜入社作价低，不少的少数民族社员减少了收入。各地访问团在访问中还广泛征求了各少数民族在发展生产上的意见和要求，并把所发现的问题加以整理，正准备汇报给中共内蒙古自治区委员会以便解决。
