    In the Land of Apples
    -- On the Issue of Apple Procurement
    Jin Yukun

    October is the season for harvesting apples on the Liaodong Peninsula. On my way back to Shenyang from Dalian, I took the opportunity to visit Delisi in Fuxian County – a major apple-producing area.

    In this land of apples, people can't help but want to buy some apples to take home. However, to my surprise and disappointment, I couldn't buy a single apple, whether at the station or at the village supply and marketing cooperative. It turned out that all the apples here had been "exclusively purchased and sold" by the procurement station.

    A farm chairman told me that according to the regulations of the procurement department, all apples that can be purchased by the state are not allowed to be sold privately, including those by the farm members who grow the apples. "Those who grow melons cannot eat melons, those who grow beans cannot eat beans." It seems to go against human nature, but here it has become "law."

    Apple growers fear two things: pests and strong winds. This year, on the evening of National Day, a strong wind hit the Liaodong Peninsula, knocking down more than 900,000 jin of apples from the Delisi Collective Farm. Once the apples fall to the ground, they can't be sold at a good price. In previous years, as long as apples were windfalls, the procurement station would price them at two fen per jin, regardless of whether more than 80% of them were good apples. This was almost like taking advantage of a disaster! This year, although the system was changed to purchasing based on grade, the average price was still only five fen per jin, and the farm would lose about 50,000 yuan as a result.

    If these windfall apples could be collected and processed quickly, they could still be sold at a reasonable price. However, the people at the procurement station like to take their time. The wind blew on October 1st, but the procurement didn't start until the 6th. And that's not all; the orchards have to pile up the windfall apples (the damaged apples rot even faster when piled up). Due to the low procurement price, the farm's enthusiasm for handling the apples has been affected. By around October 20th, the farm estimated that about 100,000 jin had already rotted. It is said that the procurement station takes its time not only because of some objective difficulties, but also because they believe that the faster they collect, the more rotten apples will be on their books.

    Since the procurement station cannot actively and quickly process the apples, why not let the farm handle them themselves? Not long ago, the farm had reached an agreement with merchants, who would buy a batch of apples that the procurement station didn't want at a more reasonable price. However, the procurement station did not allow unauthorized disposal and took them at an extremely low price. Some of the lower-quality apples were neither wanted by the procurement station nor allowed to be sold by the orchards themselves, so a large number of edible apples were fed to pigs.

    Farm members do not generally oppose the "exclusive purchase and sale" of apples, because they understand that a large part of the apples here are supplied for export. The question is whether the procurement station should have a monopoly on the domestic sale of apples. In fact, the monopoly is detrimental to both producers and consumers. Farm members have seen with their own eyes that apples sold by the farm at 2.5 fen per jin are resold by the procurement station locally at six fen. The losers are of course the farm and the consumers. If the farm's 900,000 jin of windfall apples could bypass the food company's circulation link and go directly to the cities and sales units, they could be sold for five fen more per jin, in addition to management and transportation costs, which would reduce the farm's losses from the wind disaster.

    The price difference between apple production and sales is indeed too large at present. For example, the highest procurement price for domestic Guoguang apples produced in Delisi is 8.5 fen per jin; the procurement price for the best domestic Hongyu apples is only 6.1 fen per jin. However, such apples are sold in Shenyang for more than three jiao per jin. Slightly worse apples are procured for only four or five fen, but are sold in Shenyang for more than two jiao. A large number of ungraded apples do not even have a fixed price, so the procurement station gives them whatever they want, at two or three fen per jin. Delisi is only a few hundred miles from Shenyang, and transportation is very convenient, with the freight for one jin of apples costing no more than two fen, but the price difference between production and sales is several times greater.

    Improving the apple procurement work in this area is indeed worthy of attention from higher authorities!

    在苹果之乡
    ——关于苹果收购问题
    金雨困
    10月，正是辽东半岛苹果收获的季节。从大连返沈阳的途中，我顺便去复县得利寺——苹果的主要产区看看。
    在这苹果之乡，人们总不免想买点苹果带回家去。可是，我意外地遗憾了，无论在车站或者是村的供销合作社里，都买不到一个苹果。原来这里的苹果已全部为收购站“包购包销”。
    一位农庄主席告诉我：按照收购部门的规定：凡是能够被国家收购的苹果，一律不准出卖，这里面也包括种苹果的庄员。“种瓜的人不能吃瓜，种豆的人不能吃豆”，说起来，似乎有违人之常情，但是在这里却已成为“立法”。
    种苹果的人一怕虫，二怕刮大风。今年国庆节晚上辽东半岛来了一场大风，把得利寺集体农庄的苹果刮落了九十多万斤。苹果一刮到地，就卖不起价钱。在往年，只要是风落苹果，不管其中80％以上都是好苹果，收购站就一律作价每斤二分，这简直有点像乘火打劫！今年虽然改为按等论价收购，但平均价格每斤还不过五分钱，农庄因此要损失五万元左右。
    这些风落的苹果，如果能快收快处理，还能卖个合适的价钱。但是收购站的人却喜欢慢慢来。10月1日刮的风，直拖到6日才开始收购。这还不算，还要果园把风落苹果堆起来（受伤的苹果窝在堆里，烂得就更快）。由于收购价太低，影响了农庄处理苹果的积极性。这批苹果拖到10月20日左右，农庄估计已烂的约有十多万斤。据说，收购站慢慢来，除了有些客观困难外，还因为他们认为收得越快，要烂的苹果就烂在自己的帐上了。
    既然收购站不能积极迅速处理，为什么又不让农庄自己处理呢？不久前，农庄已同商贩谈妥，由商贩出较合理的价格，收购一批已为收购站不要的苹果。但收购站却不准擅自处理，而以极低价格收了去。有些较次的苹果，收购站既不要，果园又不能自行出售，结果只好将大量能吃的苹果喂了猪。
    农庄庄员并不一概反对苹果的“包购包销”，因为他们懂得这里的苹果有很大一部分是供应出口的。问题是在内销苹果是否应该由收购站独家经营。事实上，独家经营对生产者和消费者都是不利的。农庄庄员亲眼看到，农庄以二分五厘一斤出售的苹果，采购站在当地转手就以六分出售。吃亏的当然是农庄和消费者。如果农庄的九十万斤风落苹果不经食品公司的周转环节，而送入城市和销售单位直接见面，每斤苹果除了管理运输费用外，就可以多卖五分钱，这样就可减少农庄遭受风灾的损失。
    目前苹果的产销价格确实相差太大。例如得利寺所产内销的国光苹果，最高的收购价是八分五厘一斤；最好的内销红玉苹果，收购价仅六分一斤。而这样的苹果到了沈阳，每斤零售价都要卖到三角以上。差一点的苹果，收购价只有四五分钱，到沈阳也要卖到二角以上。大量的等外苹果更连个固定价格也没有，那就由收购站按每斤二分、三分随便给了。得利寺距沈阳不过几百里路，运输十分方便，一斤苹果的运费顶多不超过二分钱，但是产销价格却差了好几倍。
    改进这个地区苹果的收购工作，确实值得上级机关注意！
