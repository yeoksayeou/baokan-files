Xinhua News Agency, November 6th, New York: The United Nations Security Council held a meeting on the evening of November 5th at the request of Soviet Foreign Minister Shepilov to the President of the Security Council. The issue the Soviet Union requested the meeting to discuss was: "Regarding the United Kingdom, France, and Israel's failure to implement the November 2nd resolution of the United Nations General Assembly Emergency Session and regarding the immediate adoption of measures to halt the aforementioned countries' aggression against Egypt."

Before adopting the agenda, the President of the Security Council invited United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskjöld to speak. Hammarskjöld said that he wanted to report to the Security Council on "progress" in ceasefire efforts. He said that it appeared a ceasefire was contingent upon the plan to establish an international force, and he hoped that a plan that had been proposed could be adopted soon. Hammarskjöld also said that he had received a letter from British representative Dixon. This letter stated: "Orders have been issued to cease all further bombing of the whole of Egypt."

Soviet representative Sobolev said that, although the Secretary-General had made a report, the issue raised by the Soviet delegation had not lost its timeliness. Sobolev, referring to the words in Dixon's letter quoted by Hammarskjöld, said that it was true that his quoted statement was in the letter. However, after this sentence in Dixon's letter, it also said: "Other various activities of the air force – excluding bombing – will be limited to supporting necessary military operations in the Canal Zone." This meant that new military operations would be launched in the Suez Canal area, and these operations would receive air support, such as, perhaps, the landing of paratroopers or the use of missiles, and so on.

Then, the meeting voted on whether to include the issue raised by the Soviet delegation on the agenda. The Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, and Iran voted in favor, the United States, Britain, France, and Australia voted against, and Belgium, Cuba, Peru, and Chiang Kai-shek's followers abstained.

Thus, the Soviet delegation's proposal, aimed at quickly stopping the aggression of Britain, France, and Israel against Egypt, was not included on the Security Council's agenda because the United States openly sided with the aggressor nations.

U.S. Representative Lodge, in "explaining" his vote, said that the Secretary-General's report showed that he was making progress, and therefore the U.S. delegation did not support the Soviet proposal.

Soviet representative Sobolev replied that Britain and France had rejected the recommendation on cessation of military operations adopted by the United Nations General Assembly, and were continuing the war of aggression against Egypt. The Soviet representative stressed that there was no guarantee of cessation of military operations in the British representative's letter to the Secretary-General. On the contrary, the letter revealed the intention to continue the aggression. The current situation required the United Nations to take decisive action. However, the Security Council not only refused to adopt the Soviet proposal, but even refused to study it, refusing to study the problem of Britain and France violating the United Nations resolution. If the conflict continues to expand and the situation continues to deteriorate, the responsibility should be borne by those who refused to include the issue raised by the Soviet delegation on the agenda, and primarily by the United States.

After the Security Council meeting ended, the United Nations Asian-African Group requested an immediate emergency meeting of the United Nations General Assembly on the Egyptian question. However, the President of the General Assembly, Chilean representative Ortega, without consulting the delegations of countries concerned with the rapid cessation of aggression against Egypt, announced that, due to the lateness of the hour, the United Nations General Assembly would not hold a meeting on the 5th, and later he announced that the United Nations General Assembly emergency meeting would be held on the 6th (time to be determined).

It was learned outside the United Nations that the representatives of the United States, Britain, and France had reached an agreement after receiving the letter from Soviet Foreign Minister Shepilov: not to allow, or at least to delay, a broad discussion of the Soviet proposal.

### 美英法在安理会上否决苏联建议  阻止讨论采取措施制止英法侵略问题

    美英法在安理会上否决苏联建议
    阻止讨论采取措施制止英法侵略问题
    新华社6日讯　据塔斯社纽约6日讯：联合国安全理事会应苏联外交部长谢皮洛夫向安全理事会主席提出的请求，在11月5日晚上举行会议。苏联要求会议讨论的问题是：“关于英国、法国和以色列不执行11月2日联合国大会紧急会议的决议和关于立即采取措施制止上述国家对埃及的侵略”。
    在通过议程以前，安全理事会主席请联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德讲话。哈马舍尔德说，他想向安全理事会报告在停火方面的“进展”。他说，看来停火取决于建立国际部队的计划，他希望已经提出的一个计划能够在最近获得通过。哈马舍尔德还说，他接到英国代表狄克逊的一封信。这封信说：“已经发出关于此后停止对整个埃及作任何轰炸的命令。”
    苏联代表索波列夫说，虽然秘书长作了报告，但是苏联代表团所提的问题并没有丧失时效。索波列夫谈到哈马舍尔德所引述的狄克逊信中的话说，不错，这封信里有他所引述的那句话。但是，在狄克逊信中这句话的后面又说：“空军其他各种活动——轰炸除外——将限于支持运河地区的必要军事行动。”这就是说，在苏伊士运河地区将展开新的军事行动，而这种行动将得到空中的支持，例如，可能采取伞兵登陆或者使用导弹等等。
    接着，会议就是否把苏联代表团提出的问题列入议程进行表决。苏联、南斯拉夫和伊朗投赞成票，美国、英国、法国和澳大利亚投反对票，比利时、古巴、秘鲁和蒋介石分子弃权。
    这样，苏联代表团提出的目的在于从速制止英法和以色列侵略埃及的建议，由于美国公开站在侵略国方面而没有被列入安全理事会议程。
    美国代表洛奇在“解释”投票理由的时候说，秘书长的报告表明他正在取得成就，因此美国代表团不支持苏联的建议。
    苏联代表索波列夫回答说，英法拒绝了联合国大会通过的关于停止军事行动的建议，并且继续进行侵略埃及的战争。苏联代表着重指出，在英国代表给秘书长的信中没有对停止军事行动作出任何保证。相反地，这封信流露出要继续进行侵略的意图。当前形势要求联合国采取坚决的行动。但是，安理会不仅拒绝采纳苏联的建议，而且甚至拒绝研究这种建议，拒绝研究英法破坏联合国决议的问题。如果冲突继续扩大和局势继续恶化，责任应当由拒绝把苏联代表团所提出的问题列入议程的那些人担当，首先应由美国担当。
    在安全理事会会议结束后，联合国亚非集团要求立刻召开联合国大会关于埃及问题的紧急会议。但是大会主席、智利代表奥特加没有同关心迅速停止对埃及的侵略的各国代表团磋商，就宣布说，由于时间太晚，联合国大会在5日将不举行会议，后来他又宣布，联合国大会紧急会议将在6日举行（时间另定）。
    在联合国会外获悉，美英法三国代表在收到苏联外交部长谢皮洛夫的信之后，曾经达成一项协议：不许、或者至少是拖延广泛讨论苏联的建议。
