Reactions to Criticism

　　Measures to Prevent Overtime Work

　　The Northwest First Engineering Company of the Ministry of Construction Engineering wrote that after the People's Daily published an article on July 24 criticizing our company's No. 1 and No. 3 Engineering Zones for "relapsing into the old habit of overtime work," our company's Party Committee immediately studied the matter and instructed the two engineering zones to conduct an investigation. The investigation proved that the criticism was basically correct. In order to prevent similar errors from occurring, the Party Committee proposed the following improvement measures: (1) Each unit should conduct a thorough work inspection in conjunction with the article "Relapse into the Old Habit of Overtime Work." (2) Starting from August 1, any "overtime" required due to special circumstances must be approved by the company and the local labor department. (3) The results of the investigation into the facts of abusing overtime work should be circulated throughout the company to educate all leading cadres.

　　Strictly Prevent Detonators from Mixing into Coal

　　The Datong Mining Bureau wrote that the criticism in the reader's letter "Datong Coal Often Mixed with Detonators," published on page two of the People's Daily on August 5, is completely correct. According to investigation, the main reason for detonators mixing into coal is the lax management of explosives by the leadership. In order to avoid the occurrence of detonators mixing into coal, our mine will focus on implementing the following in the future: (1) Strengthen explosives management and establish a blaster responsibility system and area management. (2) Strengthen the resistance inspection of detonators and issue them separately according to size for use. (3) Paint the ends of the detonators with colors and markings to facilitate checking the responsibility of those who lose them. (4) Strengthen the business security responsibility system, strictly implement regulations and systems, and educate all employees to implement them.

　　This "Unreasonableness" is Still Unavoidable at Present

　　The Yunyang County Power Plant, a local state-private joint venture in Sichuan Province, wrote that the letter from Li Chuantao published in the People's Daily on August 17, criticizing our plant for unreasonable electricity charges, is correct, but our plant is not yet in a position to improve it quickly. Our plant is an old-fashioned raw coal power plant without industrial users, only providing evening lighting for residents. If we were to charge electricity fees reasonably like large power plants, we would have to install electricity meters, which would not only be insufficient for our plant's equipment capacity, but also could cause machine failures and power outages. Therefore, we have to adopt the method of charging a fixed fee per light. The same is true for the power supply for the loudspeakers used at large meetings, which causes some lights to be on during the day. Originally, only one line would be needed to supply power to the loudspeakers, but in order to ensure the balanced operation of the machines and achieve normal voltage, we have to open two lines of current. This special phenomenon of wasting electricity is still unavoidable under our existing equipment conditions. As for the electricity fee, it is completely paid by the meeting and is not borne by other users.

    对批评的反应
    防止加班加点的措施
    建筑工程部西北第一工程公司来信说，人民日报7月24日批评我公司一、三工区“加班加点的旧病复发”一文后，我公司党委即作了研究，责成这两个工区进行检查。检查证明批评基本上是正确的。为了防止类似错误的发生，党委提出以下改进措施：（一）结合“加班加点旧病复发”一文，各单位认真进行一次工作检查。（二）自8月1日起，凡因特殊情况需要“加点”的，须经公司和当地劳动部门批准。（三）通过对滥行加班加点的事实检查结果，通报全公司，以教育全体领导干部。
    严防雷管混入煤炭
    大同矿务局来信说：人民日报8月5日二版发表的读者来信“大同煤常混有雷管”一文的批评是完全正确的。据查，造成雷管混入煤内的主要原因是领导上对于火药管理制度不严。为了避免雷管混入煤内的情况的发生，今后我矿将着重执行：（1）加强火药管理，建立放炮员责任制和区域管理。（2）加强雷管的电阻检验，分别大小发出使用。（3）雷管端涂以颜色和标号，以便查对丢失者的责任。（4）加强业务保安责任制，严厉执行规程制度，并教育全体职工贯彻执行。
    这种“不合理”目前还难免
    四川省地方合营云阳县发电厂来信说：人民日报8月17日发表李传涛的来信，批评我厂收电费不合理是正确的，但目前我厂尚无条件很快改进。我厂是一个老式的原煤机电厂，没有工业用户，仅供居民晚间照明。如果像大电厂一样合理收电费，必须安装电表，这样不仅我厂的设备能力不够，且机器可能发生故障造成停电事故。因此，我们不得不采用包灯制的办法收费。关于开大会用扩音器的供电，使一部分电灯白天也亮着的问题也是这样。本来只供扩音器一条线路就行了，但为了保证机器运转平衡，达到电压正常，我们不得不开两条线路的电流。这种浪费电力的特殊现象，在我们现有的设备条件下，还是难以避免的。至于电费是完全由大会支付，没有让其他用户负担。
