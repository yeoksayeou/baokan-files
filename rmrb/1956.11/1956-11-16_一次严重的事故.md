    A Serious Accident
    The Sixth Team of the Dahe Township Agricultural Production Cooperative in Jinning, Yunnan Province, neglected production safety, resulting in a serious casualty accident. This area is mountainous, with sparse and scattered housing, and the houses are also small. This year, the cooperative had a bumper harvest, and there was no place to store the harvested grain. They spent a lot of effort building two drying lofts entirely out of wood to be used as drying grounds when harvesting corn. This drying loft was about ten feet high, thirty feet wide, and seventy or eighty feet long, with nothing underneath. The cooperative planned to put all the harvested corn on this drying loft, dry it, and then distribute it to the members to take home. Problems arose when only five or six thousand catties had been placed there. At that time, two production team leaders and one deputy production captain were sleeping under the loft to guard the corn, and several members were also downstairs holding a small group meeting to discuss planting issues. Just as the meeting was starting, one member heard the sound of corn falling and shouted, "It's collapsing, run!" Only three people managed to escape before it collapsed, injuring eight people and killing three. It is hoped that all localities will pay attention to preventing similar incidents from happening.　Zheng Youzhang

    一次严重的事故
    云南晋宁大河乡农业生产合作社第六队，忽视生产安全，造成了严重的伤亡事故。这里是山区，住的人家分散、稀少，房屋也矮小。今年社里丰收了，打下的粮食没处放，他们就花了很大功夫完全用木料盖了两个晒楼，收玉米时做晒场用。这个晒楼约有一丈高，三丈宽，七八丈长，下面全是空的，社里准备把收回来的玉米都要放在这个晒楼上，晒干后再分配给社员收回家去、才放到五、六千斤的时候便出问题了。当时，有两个生产组长，一个生产副队长睡在楼下看守玉米，还有几个社员也在下边开小组会讨论收种问题，才开会的时候，有一个社员发现了玉米掉下来的响声，即喊：“垮啦，快跑！”仅跑出三人就塌了，砸伤了八人，砸死了三人。希望各地注意防止发生同类事情。　郑有章
