    Xinhua News Agency, 23rd dispatch from London: The oil shortage in Western Europe, caused by the Anglo-French invasion of Egypt and the blockage of Middle Eastern oil sources, is becoming more severe by the day.

    In Britain, since the government announced that it would implement oil rationing starting December 17th, there has been a wave of panic buying of oil. Because the authorities have forbidden residents from buying gasoline in containers and limited them to filling up the limited-capacity gasoline tanks of their cars, many people are driving their cars from one gas station to another to frantically fill up with gasoline, and then sucking the gasoline out of the car's fuel tank at home to store it. Under these circumstances, many gas stations have put up signs saying "Serving Regular Customers Only," and some gas stations have put up signs saying "No Gasoline."

    Approximately one thousand British truck drivers, on the 21st, followed the meat transport drivers in holding a strike to protest the car company's decision to stop one out of every ten vehicles to save gasoline. Due to the strike, the transportation of tons of goods (including food) has been halted.

    In France, as the gasoline shortage becomes more and more acute, ten out of eleven gas stations in Paris were already closed on the 22nd. The black market price of gasoline has doubled.

    Paris police authorities on the 22nd ordered residents to not store more than five liters of gasoline in their homes.

    The number of vehicles on the streets of Paris has been greatly reduced, and many doctors complain that they cannot see patients in a timely manner.

    The Irish government announced on the 21st that it will implement gasoline rationing starting January 1st of next year.

    The Italian cabinet has decided to allow oil merchants to increase oil prices by 10% to 11%.

    West Germany has announced restrictions on the use of fuel oil and diesel.

    The Belgian government announced that it will reduce the consumption of oil and fuel oil by 10% to 20%.

    英国发生抢购石油风潮
    巴黎汽油黑市涨价一倍
    新华社23日讯　伦敦消息：由于英法侵略埃及、阻塞中东油源而引起的西欧石油荒一天比一天严重起来。
    在英国，自从政府宣布从12月17日起将实行石油配给制以后，已经发生了石油抢购风潮。由于当局禁止居民用器皿购买汽油而限定只能把汽油灌入容量有限的汽车油箱，许多人都开着汽车从一个加油站跑到另一个加油站去抢灌汽油，回家以后再把汽油从汽车油箱中吸出来储存起来。在这种情况之下，许多加油站都挂出了“只供应经常主顾”的牌子，有些加油站挂出了“没有汽油”的牌子。
    大约一千个英国运货汽车司机在21日继肉类运输司机举行了罢工，抗议汽车公司决定在每十辆车中停驶一辆来节省汽油的措施。由于罢工，成吨的货物（包括食物）的运输停滞了。
    在法国，由于汽油缺乏越来越尖锐，22日巴黎每十一个汽车加油站中有十个已经关闭。汽油的黑市价格已经上涨了一倍。
    巴黎的警察当局22日下令禁止居民在他们的家里贮存五公升以上的汽油。
    巴黎街上的车辆大大减少，许多医生抱怨他们不能及时地去看病人。
    爱尔兰政府21日宣布将从明年1月1日起实行汽油配给制。
    意大利内阁已经决定准许石油商把石油价格提高10％到11％。
    西德已经宣布限制使用燃料用油和柴油。
    比利时政府宣布将降低石油和燃料用油的消费量10％到20％。
