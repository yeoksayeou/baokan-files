Xinhua News Agency, London, November 17th: TASS reported from London on the 16th: The Political Committee of the British Communist Party issued a statement saying that the enemies of the working class and the reactionary press are launching a frenzied attack on the Communist Party. However, the British Communist Party will not abandon the struggle against capitalism and imperialism, and it will never stop fighting for peace and socialism.

    The statement said: "Today, despite the reactionary press's ravings, the Communist Party continues to speak out the truth about the conspiracies and actions of fascists and reactionaries, both inside and outside Hungary. The Communist Party will not be bought, stifled, forced into silence, or intimidated."

    "Our party members' response to this attack by class enemies is to unite our ranks and further consolidate them." "The results of our party's work and the debates within our ranks will consolidate the party and strengthen its unity on the basis of trust."

    The statement also pointed out that Communist Party members at meetings held throughout the country expressed firm support for the Executive Committee's policies, support for the international communist movement, and striving to unite to jointly fight against fascism, for the cause of socialism and peace. The capitalist newspapers avoid mentioning this.

    The Political Committee concluded by calling on all party members: "Unite to fight together and repel the enemy's attack! Unite, build and consolidate the Communist Party!"

    团结起来击退反动派法西斯进攻！
    英共政治委员会指出共产党决不会被吓倒
    新华社17日讯　据塔斯社伦敦16日讯：英国共产党政治委员会发表声明说，工人阶级的敌人和反动报刊正在向共产党发动疯狂的进攻，但是，英国共产党将不放弃反对资本主义、反对帝国主义的斗争，它决不停止争取和平和社会主义的斗争。
    声明说：“今天，尽管反动报刊狂吠，共产党仍然把匈牙利国内外法西斯分子和反动分子的阴谋和行动的真相讲出来。共产党是不会被收买、被扼杀的，不会被迫不作声的，不会被吓倒的。”
    “我们党的党员对阶级敌人的这个进攻的回答是团结自己的队伍，使它进一步巩固。”“我们党所进行的工作的结果、我们队伍中所进行的争论，将会巩固党和在信任的基础上加强党的团结。”
    声明还指出，共产党员在全国各地举行的会议上表示坚决支持执行委员会的政策，支持国际共产主义运动，争取团结起来共同为反对法西斯主义、为社会主义和和平事业而奋斗，而资本主义报纸对这一点却避而不谈。
    政治委员会最后号召全体党员：“团结起来共同奋斗，击退敌人的进攻！团结起来，建设和巩固共产党！”
