    Shanghai's "Big Spenders"
    Hua Jun

    Two or three months ago, Shanghai's market experienced serious "stockouts" and "queuing." Everything was sold out in the stores, and consumers had to queue everywhere. To buy everyday groceries in the morning, one had to queue as early as three or four in the morning, and even then, one might not get anything. As a result, residents' group meetings and newspaper readers' columns were filled with complaints, which even reached the Shanghai Municipal People's Congress. Initially, commercial department cadres tried to silence people with slogans like "buy what's available" and "eat what's available." Later, realizing this wouldn't work, they began to consider ways to change market management. However, due to the executive agencies' cautiousness and unwillingness to let go, the problem remained unresolved for a time. Recently, after conscientiously removing some unreasonable restrictions and adopting measures such as allowing vendors to "freely purchase" some goods and production units to engage in "self-production and self-sales," many problems were indeed solved. It became clear to everyone that queuing for groceries before dawn was no longer necessary, and the variety of goods in the markets had increased significantly. This shows that while Shanghai has a large market, a large population, and complex conditions, it is by no means limited to promoting "buy what's available" and "eat what's available." As long as one is willing to put in the effort, change some rigid systems, and adopt some flexible methods, there are many ways to solve problems.

    During this period, another new problem emerged in the Shanghai market: the continuous appearance of people whom journalists called "big spenders." These people often brought large amounts of cash to various stores, buying out half of the display windows at a time, making it almost impossible for some smaller retail outlets to operate. According to newspaper reporters' investigations, these "big spenders" were neither private merchants attempting to hoard and speculate, nor bourgeois individuals planning to accumulate "means of subsistence" – even if some harbored grand schemes, they have now lost their public ground for activity – but rather purchasing agents from state-owned commercial institutions in various regions with valid credentials. Naturally, these people were not well-received by the people of Shanghai because their excessive buying caused serious stockouts in some retail stores.

    However, I think it is probably not appropriate to simply blame these individuals. They were clearly dispatched by their leadership departments, not running to Shanghai to buy whatever they wanted due to "liberalism" or "acting on their own." From their own perspective, they were acting with the good intention of "serving the people." They probably also knew that rushing to various retail stores to scramble for purchases was time-consuming, labor-intensive, and unwelcome, much more troublesome than going through the normal wholesale channels, and the prices were also more expensive than wholesale. Furthermore, with the addition of transportation costs, the selling price in their local areas would inevitably be much higher than in Shanghai. However, they knew this was a thankless task but still had to try every means, running around and competing to buy from various retail stores, which must have been due to unspoken difficulties. I speculate that either the wholesale departments, constrained by plans or systems, simply did not consider their demands (both in terms of quantity and quality), or their leadership institutions did not understand the situation in Shanghai and subjectively and blindly assigned them excessive "tasks," forcing them to complete them. If the facts are indeed so, then if public opinion only criticizes them without tracing the more fundamental causes, and if commercial authorities only blame them for buying and scrambling without studying solutions, this would be as unreasonable as executing a few foot soldiers after Ma Su lost Jieting!

    上海的“豪客”
    华君
    两三个月前，上海这个市场，发生“脱销”和“排队”的严重情况。商店里样样会脱销，消费者到处要排队，早晨买点家常菜，也得深夜三四点钟就去排队，稍迟一步就会什么也买不到。于是，居民的小组会上，报纸的读者栏里，充满着一片抱怨之声，这种呼声一直叫到市人民代表大会的会场里。商业部门的干部最初是想以“有啥买啥”、“有啥吃啥”的口号来堵住人们的嘴，后来看看不行，于是开始考虑一些改变市场管理的办法；可是又因为执行机构畏首畏尾，不敢放手，一时解决不了问题。直到最近，由于认真地取消了一些不合理的限制，采取了部分商品的商贩“自由采购”和生产单位“自产自销”之类的办法之后，果然解决了不少的问题，人人看得见的就是买菜已经无需天不亮就去排队，菜场上的花色品种也增加了不少。由此可见，上海固然是市场大、人口多、情况复杂，但也决不是除了提倡“有啥买啥”、“有啥吃啥”之外，就没有别的办法。只要真正肯动动脑筋，改变一些死制度，采用一些活办法，解决问题的门道还是很多的。
    就在这期间，上海的市场上又发生了另一个新问题，那就是不断地出现许多被记者们称作“豪客”的人们。这些人常常带着大量现款到各种商店里去，一买就买空半壁橱窗，弄得有些较小的门市部几乎开不了门。据报纸记者的调查，这些“豪客”既不是企图屯积居奇的私商私贩，也不是打算积蓄“生活资料”的资产阶级，——有些人纵有雄图秘计，今天也已失去了公然活动的地盘——而都是凭证确凿的各地国营商业机构的采购员。自然，这些人是很不得上海人的好感的，因为他们抢购得太多，造成了某些门市部的严重的脱销情况。
    但是，我想，恐怕也不能简单地埋怨这些人。他们显然都是领导部门所派遣，而不是由于“自由主义”、“自作主张”而随心所欲地跑到上海来抢购的；以他们本人的心境讲，倒还都是怀着“为人民服务”的好心的。他们大约也知道跑到各门市部去争购抢买，既费时费力，又不受人欢迎，比走正规的批发路径费事得多，而且货价也比批发的贵，再加上运费，到了当地，卖价必然大大地超过上海。可是，他们明知这是吃力不讨好的事而仍然不能不千方百计，东奔西走，竞向各门市部抢购，那就一定有其说不出的苦衷在。依我推测，如果不是批发部门碍于计划或是碍于制度，根本不考虑他们的要求（量和质的要求），就是他们的领导机构不了解上海的情况，主观地、盲目地交给他们过重的“任务”，强迫他们去完成。假如事实确是如此，那末，舆论只是指摘他们，而不去追索更根本的原因；商业主管方面也只怪他们不该争购抢买，而不去研究解决的措施，这恐怕就有如马谡失守街亭而只斩几名小卒一样的不合情理了！　1956年10月
