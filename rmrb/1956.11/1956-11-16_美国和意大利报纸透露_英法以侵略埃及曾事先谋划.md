Xinhua News Agency, November 15th -- According to TASS, London, November 14th: The British "Observer" extensively reprinted a report by Chalmers Roberts, the diplomatic commentator for the American "Washington Post and Times Herald". The report reveals that the leaders of the British and French governments discussed an armed intervention plan, previously drafted with Israeli representatives, at a meeting in Paris on October 16th.

Roberts also reported on France secretly supplying jet aircraft to Israel. According to later published reports, French troops began to gather in the Marseille-Toulon area after October 16th and were told that they were preparing to go abroad, but not to Algeria. Their vehicles were painted desert colors. Also during this period, many British "Valiant" jet bombers were dispatched to Malta.

Xinhua News Agency, November 15th -- According to TASS, Rome, November 14th: According to a report published in the Italian "National Evening News," Israel's attack on Egypt, followed by the armed intervention of Britain and France against Egypt, was premeditated.

The "National Evening News" said: As early as August of this year, Lloyd and Pineau formulated a joint plan to invade Egypt. In the second half of October, representatives from Britain, France, and Israel conducted consultations and formulated the details of the plan. The plan stipulated the number of Israeli troops participating in the military operation, the routes of motorized units, and even the settlements to be occupied by the Israeli troops were drafted. On October 27th, Israeli Prime Minister Ben-Gurion and British Ambassador to Israel Nichols finalized the timing of the invasion (of Egypt). All intelligence regarding the Egyptian army was provided to Israel by Britain.

The newspaper also said, based on "well-informed sources" it had obtained, that the United States was aware of the consultations between Britain, France, and Israel.

    美国和意大利报纸透露
    英法以侵略埃及曾事先谋划
    新华社15日讯　据塔斯社伦敦14日讯：英国“观察家报”详细地转载了美国“华盛顿邮报和时代先驱报”外交评论员查默斯·罗伯茨的报道，从这个报道中可以看出，英法两国政府领导人10月16日在巴黎举行的会议上讨论了事先曾经同以色列代表拟订好的武装干涉计划。
    罗伯茨还报道了法国暗中供给以色列喷气式飞机的情况。根据这个在后来发表的消息，法国军队在10月16日以后开始在马赛—土伦区域结集，并且有人告诉这些军队说，他们准备出国，不过不是到阿尔及利亚去。它们的汽车都给涂上了沙漠似的颜色。也就在这个时期，有许多英国“勇士式”喷气轰炸机被派到马耳他岛去。
    新华社15日讯　据塔斯社罗马14日讯：据意大利“国家晚报”刊载的消息说，以色列的进攻埃及以及英国和法国随后对埃及进行的武装干涉是预先谋划好了的。
    “国家晚报”说：早在今年8月间，劳埃德和比诺就制定了共同侵略埃及的计划。在10月下半月，英国、法国和以色列的代表进行了磋商，制定了计划的细节。这个计划规定了以色列军队参加军事行动的数量和摩托化部队行动的路线等等，甚至还拟定好了以色列军队要占领的居民点。10月27日，以色列总理本—古里安和英国驻以色列大使尼科尔斯最后商妥了进攻（埃及）的时间。有关埃及军队的全部情报都是由英国提供给以色列的。
    这家报纸还根据它所得到的“灵通消息”说，美国对于英国、法国和以色列的磋商情况一直是知道的。
