	Turning a Blind Eye

	This is a photograph of Port Said under the occupation of the Anglo-French invading forces. The beautiful buildings are still smoldering, black smoke fills the sky, and the densely populated streets have been reduced to rubble... People all over the world have seen this destructive atrocity of the Anglo-French invading forces, and their hearts are filled with anger!

	However, the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, Walter Monckton, is a different kind of person. On November 24, he "visited" Port Said, toured Port Said in a jeep, and even observed Port Said from the sky in a helicopter. So, what did he see? It's strange, he wasted a lot of gasoline (something Britain currently lacks the most), but he didn't see anything at all! After his "inspection," he casually said, what does this amount to? These damages are only "superficial," and the "area of destruction is not extensive."

	Is Monckton really blind? No, it's because he has the black heart of an aggressor. In the eyes of the Anglo-French invaders, destroying Egyptian ports, bombing Egyptian cities, and massacring thousands of Egyptians is far from enough; they want to destroy the whole of Egypt. However, the Egyptian people know how to deal with these brutal invaders, and they will drive this group of arsonists and murderers completely out of their own land.

    视而不见
    这是一张英法侵略军占领下的塞得港的照片。美丽的建筑余火未尽，黑烟弥漫天空，人口密集的市街已经变成一片瓦砾……。全世界人民都看到了英法侵略军的这种破坏暴行，他们的心中充满了愤怒！
    但是，英国会计大臣华尔特·蒙克顿却是另外一种人。11月24日，他“访问”了塞得港，乘吉普车巡视了塞得港，还坐上直升飞机从天空中观察了塞得港。那么，他看见了什么呢？真是奇怪，他白白地浪费了许多汽油（目前英国最感缺乏的东西），居然什么也没有看见！他在“巡视”之后轻松地说，这算得什么？这些破坏不过是“表面上的”，而且“破坏面也不广”。
    蒙克顿真是没有眼睛吗？不是的，这是因为他有一颗侵略者的黑心。在英法侵略者看来，毁坏了埃及的港口，炸坏了埃及的城市，屠杀了成千的埃及人，这还远远不够，他们想要毁坏整个的埃及。但是，埃及人民懂得怎样对付这些残暴的侵略者，他们将把这群纵火者和杀人犯从自己国土上全部赶出去。
