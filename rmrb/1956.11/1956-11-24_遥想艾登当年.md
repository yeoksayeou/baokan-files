Recalling Eden in His Early Days
　　Méi Bìhuá
After British and French imperialism launched a war of aggression against Egypt, the British House of Commons was lively for several days. Some people vehemently cursed the government as "shameful! shameful!" and repeatedly shouted at Eden, demanding that he "resign! resign!"

Eden, hearing these curses, remained brazen and unmoved.

However, some of Eden's subordinates could not sit still. Minister of State for Foreign Affairs and Representative to the United Nations Nutting was the first to resign; the second was Eden's public relations advisor Clarke; followed by the Economic Secretary to the Treasury, Boyle. In addition, several other ministers were also clamoring for resignation.

Seeing the news of the resignation of these British ministers, I couldn't help but think of Eden's past. The time was February 1938. Eden, then the Foreign Secretary, in order to oppose Prime Minister Chamberlain's policy of appeasement towards Germany and Italy, once performed a resignation that was much talked about by the world. At the time, some people advised him not to strain his relationship with the Prime Minister too much; if he had to leave, it would be better to resign on the grounds of illness. However, Eden did it beautifully: he wrote in his resignation letter: "Recent events have revealed an irreconcilable divergence of views between us on a decision that is of the utmost importance and of particularly far-reaching impact." He said that working with the Prime Minister would make him feel "uneasy in his conscience."

What a "conscientious" Eden! After this, Chamberlain became a symbol of the policy of appeasement and was reviled by the world; while Eden's swift retreat confused some people. Eden won temporary applause.

Interestingly, Eden resigned to the Prime Minister because he opposed the policy of appeasement, but eighteen or nineteen years later, Eden, who took the seat of Prime Minister, "regretted" accepting the resignation letters of Nutting and others.

In fact, there is nothing inexplicable about Eden's resignation back then. The difference in policy between Eden and Chamberlain was nothing more than a difference within imperialist elements. But Eden back then did see farther than Chamberlain; the result of the policy of appeasement almost allowed Hitler to swallow the British Empire. Eighteen or nineteen years have passed, and today's Eden is following in the footsteps of his predecessor. However, his situation today may not be better than that of his predecessor. Just a few days after the war of aggression against Egypt began, a pile of problems appeared in Britain's economic life: Arab oil-producing countries cut off British oil pipelines, traffic on the Suez Canal came to a standstill, transportation costs rose by 15% to 20%, and due to lack of gasoline, 1,500 trucks stopped running on British roads, and even heating supplies became a problem. More importantly, "the mantis stalks the cicada, unaware of the oriole behind": American oil monopoly groups are taking advantage of the recent situation to transport American oil to Europe in order to seize Britain's traditional markets. These facts are a great threat to the already withered British imperialism.

Faced with this threat, some British capitalists had to put their hands on their wallets and recalculate the accounts. As a result, disputes broke out within the Conservative Party, and even Mr. Eden had to pretend to be "overly tired" and temporarily get rid of the work of the Prime Minister. Mr. Eden once felt "regret" about the resignation of Nutting and others, but if Mr. Eden insists on the policy of aggression against Egypt, then whether he clings to his post or suffers from political illness, things that will make him feel more "regret" in the future will be waiting for him!

    遥想艾登当年
    梅碧华
    英法帝国主义发动了侵略埃及的战争以后，英国的下院热闹了好几天。有人痛骂政府“可耻！可耻！”并且一再对着艾登喊，要他“辞职！辞职！”
    艾登听了这些咒骂，依然老着脸皮，不为所动。
    但是，艾登的几个部属稳坐不下去了。外交部国务大臣兼驻联合国代表纳丁第一个辞职；第二个是艾登的公共关系顾问克拉克；接着上来的是财政部经济次官波伊尔。此外，还有几个大臣也在吵嚷着要辞职。
    看到英国这几个大臣辞职的消息，不禁让我想起了艾登当年的往事。时间是在1938年2月，当时的外相艾登，为了反对首相张伯伦的对德对意协调政策，曾经表演过极为世人津津乐道的辞职事件。当时，有人劝他不必和首相闹得太僵；如果非走不可，还是托病辞职为妙。但是，艾登干得漂亮：他在辞职书上写道：“最近几天的事使我们两人对于一个本身极重要而影响尤其远大的决定，意见背驰，无可掩饰。”他说，和首相在一起共事，就会“良心不安”。
    好个有“良心”的艾登！在这以后，张伯伦成为绥靖政策的象征，受尽世人唾骂；而艾登急流勇退就迷惑了一些人的眼睛。艾登博得了一时的喝彩声。
    有趣的是艾登当年因为反对绥靖政策而向首相提出辞职书，而在十八、九年后的今天，坐上了首相席位的艾登，却“感到遗憾”地接受了纳丁等人的辞职书。
    其实艾登当年的辞职，没有什么不可解释的道理。艾登和张伯伦在政策上的意见分歧，不过是帝国主义分子内部的意见分歧。但是当年的艾登，毕竟比张伯伦看得远些，绥靖政策的结果，几乎使希特勒要吞掉英帝国。时间隔了十八、九年，今天的艾登却步上他的前辈的后尘了。然而，他今天的处境，未必比前辈的处境好些。侵略埃及的战争刚刚开始几天，英国在经济生活上就出现了一大堆难题：阿拉伯产油国家切断了英国的油管，苏伊士运河的交通陷入停顿，运输费上涨15％到20％，由于缺乏汽油，在英国公路上有一千五百辆卡车停止行驶，甚至连暖气供应也发生了问题。更重要的是“螳螂捕蝉，岂知黄雀在后”：美国石油垄断集团正在利用最近的形势把美洲的石油运往欧洲，以争夺英国的传统市场。这些事实对早已干瘪了的英帝国主义实在是莫大的威胁。
    面临着这种威胁，英国一部分资本家不得不手摸钱口袋，重新算算细账。于是保守党内部发生了争吵，甚至弄得艾登先生也不得不托词“疲劳过度”，暂时摆脱了首相的工作。纳丁等人的辞职曾经使艾登先生感到“遗憾”，如果艾登先生坚持侵埃政策，那末，他恋栈不去也好，害政治病也好，今后使他更感“遗憾”的事就会等着他呢！
