    Sun Yat-sen's office and residence when he served as the interim president were located in a row of bungalows and a small building on either side of the West Garden of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Tianwang Mansion on Changjiang Road, Nanjing. These houses were not protected during the Kuomintang period. When warlord Feng Guozhang's army was stationed in Nanjing, the area near the office suffered a fire, and the houses became dilapidated, with the interior furnishings completely unrecognizable. Recently, with the help of recollections from some elderly people who worked in the Presidential Palace at the time, the situation of Sun Yat-sen's office and residence at that time was identified. The People's Government has repaired them, and now these houses have been renovated, and the interior layout has been largely restored to its original appearance.

    In front of the office door is a quiet little garden, surrounded by lush cypresses and hollies, and chrysanthemums are in full bloom. The office is a row of seven bungalows. In the room where Sun Yat-sen worked, there is a desk, two wooden chairs, a small bookcase, and a set of sofas. On both sides of this room are the lounge and the conference room, both simply furnished. It was in this extremely ordinary room that Sun Yat-sen announced the overthrow of the Qing Dynasty and issued many important democratic decrees. It was here that Mr. Sun Yat-sen worked tirelessly to handle national affairs. During his time working here, Sun Yat-sen often took advantage of his breaks to visit the masses and inspect the city. Chen Bingzhi, a participant in the Xinhai Revolution and a member of the Tongmenghui, recalled that at the time, some people called Mr. Sun Yat-sen the "People's President."

    The reporter interviewed Tang Bin, the former construction section chief of the Presidential Palace, who is now eighty-eight years old. Tang Bin said that after Sun Yat-sen became the interim president, he remained like an ordinary person, with nothing special about him. Once, Tang Bin followed Sun Yat-sen from the Presidential Palace out of Zhonghua Gate in Nanjing to Yuhuatai to inspect the forts. At Yuhuatai, Sun Yat-sen saw that Zhonghua Gate had many people holding flags, preparing to welcome him. He then avoided passing through Zhonghua Gate and returned to the Presidential Palace through Tongji Gate, east of Zhonghua Gate. Sun Yat-sen said not to disturb the people because of him. Once, Sun Yat-sen went to the Kuomintang Party Headquarters to give a speech, and the guards in front of the Kuomintang Party Headquarters stopped him, saying, "President Sun is coming today, and no one else is allowed in." Sun Yat-sen said, isn't President Sun just an ordinary person? He is merely a servant of the people. Later, Sun Yat-sen took out his business card, and the soldier was somewhat panicked at the time, but Mr. Sun Yat-sen smiled and walked in.

    Sun Yat-sen's residence was not far from the office. It was a two-story Chinese-style building. The bedroom contained an old-fashioned Chinese brown bed, a small desk with three drawers, and a grass mat on the floor. Next to the bedroom were Sun Yat-sen's dining room and bathroom. Like the office, everything here was very simple.

    When the reporter visited Sun Yat-sen's residence, I recalled that at a recent symposium held in Nanjing, Liang Ruitang, an old member of the Tongmenghui, talked about Sun Yat-sen's life when he was the interim president. Liang Ruitang said that when the Presidential Palace ate elaborate dishes, it generally cost more than three yuan per meal, while Sun Yat-sen mostly ate vegetarian dishes such as green vegetables and bean sprouts, costing only about forty cents per meal.

    After visiting Mr. Sun Yat-sen's office and residence when he was the interim president, and hearing many elderly people recall the situation of Mr. Sun Yat-sen when he was the interim president, the reporter was deeply moved by Mr. Sun Yat-sen's thrifty lifestyle.

    访孙中山先生任临时大总统时的办公室
    新华社记者　孙振
    孙中山先生就任临时大总统时的办公室和住处，在南京市长江路太平天国天王府西花园两边的一座平房和一座小楼里。这些房屋，在国民党时期没有受到保护，军阀冯国璋军队驻在南京时，办公室附近曾遭到火灾，房屋已破旧不堪，室内陈设已面目全非。最近，经过当时在总统府工作的一些老人的回忆，才辨别出当时孙中山先生的办公室和住处的情景。人民政府进行了修理，现在这些房屋已经面目一新，室内布置也大体恢复了原来的面貌。
    办公室门前是一个幽静的小花园，四周围着苍翠的龙柏和冬青，园内菊花盛开。办公室是七间平房。在孙中山先生办公的那间屋子里，放着一张办公桌、两张木椅、一只小书橱和一套沙发。这间屋子的两旁，是休息室和会议室，陈设都很简朴。就是在这所极其普通的屋子里，孙中山先生宣布了清朝统治的覆灭，并且签发了许多重要的民主政令。就是在这里，中山先生曾为处理国家事务而紧张地工作过。孙中山先生在这里工作期间，还时常利用休息时间访问群众，视察市政。辛亥革命的参加者、同盟会员谌秉直回忆说，当时有人称中山先生是“平民总统”。
    记者访问了当时总统府的建筑科长唐斌。唐斌现年八十八岁了。他说，孙中山先生就任临时大总统以后，仍和普通人一样，没有什么特殊的地方。有一次，唐斌跟孙中山先生从总统府出南京中华门到雨花台视察炮台。在雨花台，孙中山先生看见中华门拥有许多拿旗子的人，准备欢迎他。他就不从中华门经过，改从中华门东面的通济门返回了总统府。孙中山先生说，不要因为他而打扰了人民群众。有一次，孙中山先生去国民党党部演讲，国民党党部门前卫兵拦住他不让进去，说是“今天孙大总统要来，别人不让进去”。孙中山先生说，孙大总统不也是一个普通的人吗，他不过是众百姓的公仆。后来，孙中山先生把名片拿出来，那个士兵当时有些惊慌，但中山先生微笑着走了进去。
    孙中山先生的住处就在离办公室不远的地方。这是一座中国式的两层小楼房，卧室内放着一张中国旧式的棕床，一张三抽屉的小办公桌，地板上铺着草毯。卧室旁边是孙中山先生的餐室和浴室。和办公室一样，这里的一切设备也都很简朴。
    记者访问孙中山先生的住处时，想起最近在南京举行的一次座谈会上，同盟会老会员梁瑞堂谈到关于孙中山先生任临时大总统时的生活情况。梁瑞堂说，当时总统府吃大菜时，一般每餐在三元以上，而孙中山先生所吃的多是青菜、豆芽等素菜，每餐只有四角钱左右。
    访问了中山先生就任临时大总统时的办公室和住处，听过许多老人回忆起的关于孙中山先生任临时大总统时的情况，记者深深地为中山先生的俭朴生活作风所感动。
