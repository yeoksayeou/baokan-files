    Xinhua News Agency, Prague, November 2nd: Budapest Dispatch: The Nagy government unilaterally announced its withdrawal from the Warsaw Pact and demanded the "immediate withdrawal" of Soviet troops stationed in Hungary under the Warsaw Pact.
    On November 1st, Imre Nagy sent a telegram to Voroshilov, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, requesting "immediate negotiations on the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Hungary" and "requesting the Soviet government to designate a place and date for negotiations."
    However, on the morning of the same day, I. Nagy informed Soviet Ambassador to Hungary, Andropov, that his government was immediately abolishing the Warsaw Pact and simultaneously declaring Hungary's neutrality. He proclaimed that his government was turning to the United Nations and requesting the four major powers to help maintain Hungary's neutrality.
    The Warsaw Treaty was a treaty of friendship, cooperation, and mutual assistance signed jointly in Warsaw on May 14, 1955, by Albania, Bulgaria, Hungary, the German Democratic Republic, Poland, Romania, the Soviet Union, and Czechoslovakia. Its purpose was to safeguard the collective security of the aforementioned socialist countries and jointly prevent imperialist aggression. The stationing of a portion of the Soviet army in Hungary was an agreement reached between the Soviet Union and Hungary based on the Warsaw Treaty. The Nagy government's unilateral declaration of withdrawal from the Warsaw Pact and its request for the "four major powers" to maintain Hungary's "neutrality" demonstrates that this government has abandoned the socialist principles of the Hungarian People's Republic's constitution and has turned to the side of imperialist countries.
    Nagy informed the heads of the foreign diplomatic missions in Budapest of his meeting with the Soviet Ambassador to Hungary and telegraphed his decision to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, requesting that the meeting organized by the United Nations prioritize the Hungarian question on its agenda for discussion.
    The aforementioned measures of the Nagy government have been broadcast by Budapest Radio.
    Nagy delivered another radio address on November 2nd, announcing Hungary's "neutrality." He stated that Hungary wished to remain outside of any "bloc."
    As early as October 31st, Nagy had already publicly announced that his government would withdraw from the Warsaw Pact. On the same day, he told the press that he wanted to make Hungary "a neutral and strong stronghold in Central Europe."

    纳吉政府背弃匈民族利益
    片面废除华沙条约转向帝国主义方面
    新华社布拉格2日电　布达佩斯消息：纳吉政府片面地宣告退出华沙条约，并且要求根据华沙条约驻扎在匈牙利的苏军部队“立即撤退”。
    伊姆雷·纳吉11月1日致电苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席伏罗希洛夫，要求“立即就苏联军队从匈牙利撤退事进行谈判”，并且“请苏联政府指定谈判地点和日期。”
    但是同日上午，伊·纳吉就通知苏联驻匈牙利大使安德洛波夫说：他的政府立即废除华沙条约，同时宣布匈牙利中立。他宣称他的政府转向联合国，并要求四大国帮助维护匈牙利的中立。
    华沙条约是1955年5月14日由阿尔巴尼亚、保加利亚、匈牙利、德意志民主共和国、波兰、罗马尼亚、苏联、捷克斯洛伐克八国在华沙共同签订的友好合作互助条约，它的目的是维护上述社会主义国家的集体安全，共同防止帝国主义的侵略。苏联的一部分军队驻在匈牙利，就是苏匈两国根据华沙条约而达成的协议。纳吉政府片面地宣告退出华沙条约，而要求“四大国”维护匈牙利的“中立”，就表明这一政府已经背离匈牙利人民共和国宪法的社会主义原则而转入帝国主义国家方面。
    纳吉把他同苏联驻匈牙利大使举行会谈这件事通知了驻布达佩斯的各国外交使团的首脑，同时打电报把他的决定告诉联合国秘书长，并且要求联合国组织的会议把匈牙利问题优先列入议程加以讨论。
    纳吉政府的上述措施已由布达佩斯电台广播。
    纳吉11月2日又发表广播演说，宣布匈牙利“中立”。他说，匈牙利希望站在任何“集团”之外。
    还在10月31日，纳吉就已经当众宣布：他的政府将退出华沙条约。同日，他向报界声称，他要使匈牙利成为“中欧的一个中立的坚强据点”。
