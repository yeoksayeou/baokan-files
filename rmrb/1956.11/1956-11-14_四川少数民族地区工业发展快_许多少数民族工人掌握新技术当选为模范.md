Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, November 13th (Xinhua News Agency reporter Yu Jingqi): In the past, Sichuan Province's Tibetan, Yi, and Qiang minority areas had almost no modern industry. Now, a number of factories and mines have been established in the years since liberation. Forest industry has developed the fastest in this vast area, which includes the eastern part of the Kangzang Plateau and the Greater and Lesser Liang Mountains. Since the development of the first forest area in the Lai Su Gully area of the Aba Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in 1951, five forest areas have been successively logged in the upper reaches of the Min River, the Da and Xiao Jin Rivers, and the downstream tributaries of the Dadu River. Tens of thousands of workers are working in the primeval forests. During the First Five-Year Plan, these forest areas supplied more than 1.2 million cubic meters of timber for construction in Southwest China.

On the grasslands where the Red Army passed during the Long March, several dairy processing plants, power plants, and coal mines are under construction and being prepared for construction.

More than 20 large and small factories and mines, including ironworks, coal mines, power plants, tanneries, and fertilizer plants, have been successively established in minority areas. The Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture has established one of China's largest mica mines, the Danba Mica Mine, which produces high-quality mica. The ore from the Daofu Iron Mine in this prefecture has an average iron content of over 70%, which steelworkers in the interior call a "gem" for steelmaking. A wool washing factory in Kangding is the first factory in the minority areas of Sichuan to use mostly machines for production.

In recent years, these factories and mines have supplied the inland industrial construction with large quantities of mica, ore, and wool, and produced hundreds of kinds of farm implements, hunting guns, fertilizers, shoes, and other supplies, including more than 100,000 pieces of farm implements alone.

Because factories and mines in various places pay attention to absorbing and training local ethnic workers, there are now hundreds of Tibetan, Yi, and Qiang workers in the forestry industry system. Before liberation, the Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture did not have a single industrial worker. Now, the prefecture has 700 industrial workers and construction and transportation workers. With the help of Han workers, they have quickly mastered technology, and many have been elected as model workers.

    四川少数民族地区工业发展快
    许多少数民族工人掌握新技术当选为模范
    新华社成都13日电　新华社记者于竟祁报道：在过去几乎没有现代工业的四川省藏、彝、羌等民族地区，一批工厂、矿山已在解放后的年代中建立起来。这个包括康藏高原东部和大小凉山的广大地区，森林工业发展得最快。从1951年阿坝藏族自治州来苏沟林区第一个被开发到现在，在岷江上游，大、小金川和大渡河下游支流，已先后有五个林区进行采伐，数以万计的工人在原始森林中工作。第一个五年计划期间，这些林区已供应了西南各地建设木材一百二十多万立方公尺。
    在当年红军长征经过的草地上，几个奶品加工厂、发电厂和煤矿正在修建和准备修建。
    二十多个包括铁工、采煤、发电、制革、肥料等大、小厂矿，在少数民族地区陆续建立起来。甘孜藏族自治州建立了我国目前最大的云母矿之一——丹巴云母矿，生产的云母品质优异。这个州道孚铁矿的矿石平均含铁率达70％多，被内地炼钢工人称为炼钢的“宝石”。康定的一座洗毛厂，是四川少数民族地区第一座大部使用机器生产的工厂。
    这些厂矿几年来供应了内地工业建设需要的大批云母、矿石、羊毛，生产了上百种的农具、猎松、肥料、鞋靴等用品，只农具一项就有十几万件。
      由于各地工厂、矿山注意吸收和培养当地民族工人，现在森林工业系统已有几百名藏、彝、羌等族工人。甘孜藏族自治州解放前一个产业工人都没有，现在全州产业工人和建筑、搬运等工人已有七百多。他们在汉族工人帮助下迅速地掌握了技术，许多人当选了劳动模范。
