Xinhua News Agency, Zibo, 27th - The "May Fourth" coal mining team of the Hongshan Coal Mine in Zibo, Shandong Province, which has consistently maintained high output, recently set a new national record for thin seam mining, producing 11.777 tons of coal per work day. This record, compared to the team's previous achievement of 10.86 tons per work day in late July, represents an increase in coal mining efficiency of nearly one ton of coal per worker per day. During the seven days from November 16th to 22nd, the team's average efficiency reached over 10.5 tons of coal per worker per day. The "May Fourth" coal mining team's excellent production performance is mainly due to the team's workers promoting advanced experiences such as one-shift coal mining, deepening the coal cutter's cutting disc, and quickly moving the scraper conveyor. The team also frequently adjusts the labor organization according to the specific conditions of the working face and the amount of work for each type of work, so that all types of work are closely coordinated, and there is no idle work. The team's Party and Communist Youth League branches and trade union organizations also frequently strengthen ideological education for workers and care for their lives, which has greatly inspired and enhanced the workers' enthusiasm for production.

    开采薄煤层的新纪录
    新华社淄博27日电　连续保持高额产量的山东省淄博洪山煤矿“五四”采煤队，最近又创造了薄煤层每工日产十一点七七七吨煤的全国新纪录。这次纪录同这个队在7月下旬达到的每工日产十点八六吨比较，每工每天的采煤效率又提高了将近一吨煤。在11月16日到22日的七天里，全队的平均效率达到了每工每天产煤十吨半以上。“五四”采煤队取得这样优良的生产成绩，主要是全队工人推广了一班采煤、加深截煤机截盘和快速移溜子等先进经验的结果。该队还经常根据掌子面的具体条件和各工种工作量的多少，适当调整劳动组织，使各工种密切配合，没有窝工现象。队的党团支部和工会组织经常加强对工人的思想教育和关心他们的生活，也大大鼓舞和提高了工人的生产积极性。
