Xinhua News Agency, 21st Dispatch: This year, the number of ducks raised nationwide reached 130 million, doubling the annual number raised before the war from 1933 to 1936. Major production areas have reversed the duck production cuts of the previous two years. The five provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Hubei, and Guangdong have increased their breeding volume by 93% compared to last year.

This year, many provinces have taken active measures to encourage and help farmers raise ducks. The Jiangsu Provincial People's Committee issued duck raising targets as early as the fourth quarter of last year, making demands on farmers. Under the leadership and assistance of state-owned commercial departments and supply and marketing cooperatives, all 465 incubation houses in the province have resumed production, ensuring the supply of ducklings, breeding ducks, and hatching eggs. Recently, to help farmers solve the difficulties of insufficient feed and funds, state-owned food companies have ordered more than one million ducks with feed and cash. Guangdong Province arranged production targets and feed supply at the beginning of the year, helped most incubation houses resume production, and supplied feed to farmers through ordering and exchange methods.

Judging from several key producing areas, the prices at which state-owned commercial departments purchased ducks this year generally guaranteed the interests of producers. According to a survey in Gaoyou County, Jiangsu Province, agricultural production cooperatives that raise meat ducks and laying ducks for three months to one year have a profit rate of 50% to 100%. Tongtai Agricultural Cooperative in Gushan Township, Jingjiang County, raised 600 ducks in May this year, sold 580 to the state-owned food company in October, and obtained a net profit of more than 500 yuan. The whole cooperative plans to increase the number of ducks raised by another 1,500 to 2,000 next year.

Due to insufficient winter feed, farmers are eager to sell their ducks before winter arrives, resulting in a situation where the supply of ducks on the market has exceeded demand since the peak season began in September. The market supply in Anhui, Hunan, Jiangsu and other provinces all far exceeds the purchasing power of commercial departments and the needs of cities. Effective measures must be taken to change this situation, and farmers should be helped and encouraged to keep more breeding ducks and laying ducks to avoid affecting the output of duck eggs next year.

### 全国养鸭数增加了很多  各重点产区都改变了前两年的减产情况

    全国养鸭数增加了很多
    各重点产区都改变了前两年的减产情况
    新华社21日讯　今年全国鸭的饲养量达到一亿三千万只，比战前1933年到1936年的每年饲养数增加一倍。各重点产区都改变了前两年鸭子减产的情况。江苏、浙江、安徽、湖北、广东等五个省，今年的饲养量比去年增加93％。
    这一年，许多省都采取积极措施鼓励和帮助农民养鸭。江苏省人民委员会早在去年第四季度就下达了养鸭指标，向农民提出了要求。在国营商业部门和供销社的领导和帮助下，全省四百六十五户孵房全部恢复生产，保证了苗鸭、种鸭和种蛋的供应。最近，为帮助农民解决饲料和资金不足的困难，国营食品公司用饲料和现金订购了一百多万只。广东省在年初就安排了生产指标和饲料供应，帮助大部分孵房恢复生产，并且通过订购、换购办法，把饲料供应给农民。
    从几个重点产区看来，国营商业部门今年收购鸭的价格一般都保证了生产者的利益。据江苏省高邮县调查，农业生产合作社养三个月到一年的肉用鸭和蛋用鸭，利润率达50％到100％。靖江县孤山乡通太农业社在今年5月间养六百只鸭，10月间卖给国营食品公司五百八十只，获纯利五百多元。全社计划在明年再增养一千五百只到二千只。
    由于冬季饲料不足，农民急于在冬天到来之前把鸭卖出，以致从9月份进入旺季以来，市场上出现鸭子供过于求的情况。安徽、湖南、江苏等省的上市量都远超出商业部门的收购能力和城市需要。这种情况必须要采取有效的办法加以改变，要帮助和鼓励农民多留种鸭和蛋用鸭，以免影响明年鸭蛋的产量。
