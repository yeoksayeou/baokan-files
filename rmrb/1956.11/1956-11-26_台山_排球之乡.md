Taishan – “Hometown of Volleyball”
    Shi Yuzhong

    As dusk falls, on the beaches and in the villages of Taishan County, Guangdong Province… volleyball can be seen being played everywhere.

    Fishermen hang their tattered fishing nets, still smelling of seawater, on the branches of trees on the beach, creating a simple volleyball court, and then a joyful game begins.

    Farmers clean up the threshing ground and start the same activity. Old people squat aside, watching peacefully. Children learn from their older brothers and sisters, using bamboo poles as nets and bundles of waste paper as volleyballs.

    In the old society, many people from Taishan County were forced by poverty to leave their hometowns and seek a living overseas. They worked hard abroad, sending their savings back to build public welfare facilities, hoping that the children of their hometowns could grow up healthy. With the support of overseas Chinese, volleyball gradually developed in Taishan as early as thirty years ago.

    Twenty years ago, someone from Taishan represented our country in the Far Eastern Games volleyball competition. After returning, they often performed in rotation throughout the county, which had a great impact on the masses. At that time, the county newspaper also published news and developments of the games with considerable space. Since then, volleyball games have often been held between villages and between townships. During slack farming seasons or on festivals such as the Dragon Boat Festival, Mid-Autumn Festival, and Spring Festival, volleyball games are held in the villages of Taishan. If there are larger-scale competitions, many people go to the trouble of traveling from all directions to visit. In rainy weather, ancestral halls become the best indoor volleyball courts. Therefore, volleyball is practiced in Taishan all year round.

    After liberation, under the care of the Communist Party and the People's Government, volleyball in Taishan County has developed even further. Now the county has established twelve volleyball associations, and the County People's Committee allocates a certain amount of funds each month as association expenses. Among the two hundred and fifty townships, there are one thousand eight hundred volleyball teams and one thousand six hundred and seven volleyball courts. These teams often hold friendly matches to exchange experiences. In the past, Taishan County played nine-player volleyball with fixed positions, but now it has switched to six-player volleyball with rotating positions, so individual skills are no longer restricted by mechanical division of labor and have been fully developed. Sports skills have improved, physical health has also been strengthened, and the enthusiasm for production is even greater. In addition, the County People's Committee also pays attention to the training of cadres, regularly holding short-term training courses and workshops. At present, forty-five amateur referees and three hundred and fifty amateur instructors have been trained, and a juvenile amateur volleyball school has been established to specifically cultivate new forces.

    In recent years, Taishan County has continuously sent more than one hundred and thirty outstanding volleyball instructors and athletes to all parts of the country, helping to promote volleyball in various places. This year, nine male athletes from Taishan were selected for the national team to participate in the World Volleyball Championships held in Paris, accounting for three-quarters of the national men's volleyball team members. In the National Volleyball Championships held in Shanghai this May, the Taishan team ranked second only to the Shenyang team. In the National Junior Volleyball Championships held in Beijing this August, the Taishan junior men's team won the championship with an undefeated record. In the Eleven-County Volleyball Championships held in Beijing this month, the Taishan team won the championship with a brilliant record of ten wins out of ten games.

    The Taishan volleyball team is good at attacking, has varied tactics, and is especially good at quick spikes and diving saves. However, because of poor setting skills, the defense is relatively weak. This is inseparable from the tradition of volleyball in Taishan. Comrade Tan Junyin, the leader of the Taishan team, said: Taishan people like to watch fierce spikes and don't like to watch back and forth setting; those who can spike are considered to play well. Therefore, athletes have always focused on offensive practice, but efforts are currently being made to overcome this shortcoming.

    Volleyball has now become a very popular mass sport in Taishan. Taishan County is famous throughout the country as the "Hometown of Volleyball."

    台山——“排球之乡”
    施毓忠
    每当黄昏降临的时候，在广东省台山县的海滩上、农村里……到处都可以看到有人在打排球。
    渔民们把还带有海水味道的破鱼网挂在滩头的树丫上，制成了一个简便的排球场，于是一场愉快的球赛开始了。
    农民们把晒谷场打扫干净，展开了同样的活动。老年人蹲在一旁安详地观看。孩子们向哥哥姊姊们学习，用竹竿当网子，把废纸捆起来当排球玩。
    旧社会里，不少台山县人为穷困所迫离开家乡，远涉重洋谋求生活。他们在国外辛苦经营，把自己的积蓄寄回来兴办公众福利事业，希望家乡子弟能够健康地成长。在侨胞的支持下，早在三十年前台山的排球运动就逐渐地开展起来。
    二十年前，台山就有人代表我国参加远东运动会的排球比赛。回来以后经常在县里轮回表演，在群众中起了很大影响。当时的县报也以很大的篇幅刊登球赛的消息和动态。从此以后乡与乡之间，村与村之间经常有排球比赛。在农闲期间或者像端午节、中秋节和春节这样的节日里，台山的乡村里都要举行排球赛。如果有规模比较大的比赛，总有很多人不辞劳苦，从四面八方赶来参观。在风雨交加的日子里，祠堂便成了最好的室内排球场。因此排球运动在台山常年四季地开展着。
    解放后，在共产党和人民政府的关怀下，台山县的排球运动更加向前发展了。现在全县成立了十二个排球协会，县人民委员会每月拨出一定的款项作为协会的经费。在二百五十个乡中有一千八百个排球队，一千六百零七个排球场。这些球队经常举行友谊比赛，交流经验。过去台山县都是打固定位置的九人排球，现在改打轮换位置的六人排球，这样个人技术就不再受机械分工的限制而得到了全面的发展。运动技术提高了，身体健康也随着加强，生产的劲头也更大。此外，县人民委员会也很注意干部的培养，定期举办短期训练班和讲习班。目前已经培养出四十五名业余裁判员，三百五十名业余指导，并且还创办一所少年业余排球学校，专门培养新生力量。
    几年来，台山县曾经源源不断地向全国各地输送了一百三十多名优秀的排球指导人员和运动员，帮助推动各地的排球运动。今年有九名台山男子运动员被选入国家代表队，参加在巴黎举行的世界排球锦标赛，他们占去了国家男子排球队队员的四分之三。今年5月在上海举行的全国排球锦标赛中，台山队仅次于沈阳队取得了第二名。今年8月在北京举行的全国少年排球锦标赛中，台山少年男子队又以不败的战绩取得了冠军。本月在北京举行的十一县排球锦标赛中，台山队又以十战十胜的辉煌战果取得了冠军。
    台山排球队善于进攻，战术变化多端，尤其是快板扣球、鱼跃救球很拿手。但是由于托球技术欠佳，所以防守比较薄弱。这是和台山排球运动的传统分不开的。台山队领队谭均荫同志说：台山人爱看扣杀猛烈的球，不爱看托来托去，会扣球的才被认为打得好。因此运动员一向是偏重于进攻的练习，但是目前正在设法克服这个缺点。
    排球运动现在在台山已经成为一项非常普遍的群众性体育活动。台山县也就是以“排球之乡”而闻名全国的。
