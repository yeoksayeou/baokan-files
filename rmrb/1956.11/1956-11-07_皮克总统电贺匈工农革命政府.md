Pieck said in his congratulatory telegram: In this grave moment, I assure the Hungarian working class and all working people who are fighting for the people's regime and socialism that the peace-loving and progressive citizens of the German Democratic Republic stand by your side. The German Democratic Republic will do everything in its power, in the spirit of proletarian internationalism, to support your just struggle and help you build a better life.
