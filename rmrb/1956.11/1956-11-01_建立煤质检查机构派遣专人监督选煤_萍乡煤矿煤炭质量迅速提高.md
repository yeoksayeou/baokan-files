Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 29th. Since the third quarter, Pingxiang Coal Mine has taken various measures to improve the quality of coal. Now, the ash content of raw coal has been reduced from 27% in the first quarter to 24%, which is 1% lower than the national standard.

In the first half of the year, the ash content of coal in various mines under the Pingxiang Mining Bureau exceeded the national standard, which aroused dissatisfaction from users, and they were fined more than 103,000 yuan. At that time, although the quality of the coal was very poor, it did not attract the attention of the relevant departments of the mine. In individual mines, there were even malicious acts of mixing inferior coal into good coal.

In light of this situation, the Pingxiang Mining Bureau began to take measures in June to reduce the ash content of coal and improve its quality. They decided to stop mining coal seams with the highest stone content, and established a mine-wide coal quality inspection agency, dispatching specialists to the mines to supervise coal washing work. They also mobilized the workers of various mines to promote advanced working methods such as "separate mining of coal and stone," "separate transportation of good and bad," and the "daily picking system" (coal miners, coal loaders, chute drivers, and coal car workers pick out stones), and added equipment for screening and washing coal. After July, the quality of coal began to gradually improve. Wangjiayuan Mine, which used to be fined frequently due to poor coal quality, received a bonus of more than 100 yuan in September due to the improved coal quality and ash content being lower than the national standard.

    建立煤质检查机构派遣专人监督选煤
    萍乡煤矿煤炭质量迅速提高
    新华社南昌29日电　萍乡煤矿从第三季度以来采取各种措施提高了煤的质量。现在，原煤的灰分由第一季度的27％降低到24％，低于国家规定标准1％。
    上半年，萍乡矿务局各矿由于煤的灰分超过国家规定标准，引起了用户的不满，并且还受罚过十万三千多元。当时，煤的质量虽然很差，但没有引起矿的有关部门的重视。个别矿中，甚至还发生过在好煤中掺杂次煤的恶劣行为。
    萍乡矿务局根据这个情况，从6月份开始采取了一些降低煤的灰分、提高煤的质量的措施，他们决定停止开采含石率最多的煤层，并且成立了全矿的煤质检查机构，派出专人下矿监督选煤工作。他们还发动各矿的职工，推行“煤石分采”、“好坏分运”和“日拣制”（采煤工人、上煤工人、电溜手司机、装煤车工人拣出石头）等先进工作方法，增添了筛洗煤的设备。7月份以后，煤的质量就开始逐渐提高了。过去因煤质不好经常受罚的王家源矿，9月份由于煤的质量提高、灰分低于国家规定标准，还得到一百多元的奖金。
