    “Egypt – Grave of Foreign Invaders”
    Sī Mù
    When imperialists launch bloody wars of aggression, they always fabricate some excuses and put on a show to cover up their crimes. But the nakedness and absurdity of the Anglo-French imperialists' armed aggression against Egypt this time is rarely seen.

    This is a one hundred percent robbery, but even robbers don't have such thick skin and ugliness.

    When their vanguard – Israel – was already killing and burning in the Sinai Peninsula, when their beasts were bombing and slaughtering innocent Egyptian women and children in Cairo and Alexandria, Eden, Dixon (British representative to the UN), and de Guiringaud (French representative to the UN) and others shamelessly said their military aggression was "an emergency police action," "an emergency fire brigade action," with the aim of "restoring the rule of law," not to "stop Egypt" but to "stop the war." Such absurd and brazen lies are more shameless and hateful than a thief crying "stop thief."

    Indeed, in the vocabulary of imperialism, the so-called "restoring the rule of law" makes sense. Because what these two old-brand imperialists want to "restore" is the law of "might makes right" represented by the "Iron Chancellor," the law of "the strong eat the weak" believed by the colonialist beasts.

    Unfortunately, today's world is no longer the world of Bismarck's time, and today's Egypt is neither the Egypt of 1882 nor the Abyssinia of 1936. As soon as the Anglo-French ultimatum, with a twelve-hour deadline, was issued, the black mark of the word "aggressor" was indelibly branded on the faces of Eden and Mollet. They have become tyrants "pointed at by thousands, dying of illness," they have become rats running across the street, chased and beaten by everyone. Moreover, the Egyptian giant's unwavering determination to fight to the end is as unshakable as the pyramids, and the Arab nation's and the Asian-African people's burning hatred for the enemy is as turbulent as the Nile. In the face of the bronze walls and iron barriers they have built, the colonialists' "grand plan" to make a comeback can only be shattered, can only be destroyed like the mirage seen by travelers in the desert.

    Perhaps these two old-brand imperialists' "cunning schemes" believe that the counter-revolutionary forces have gained the "upper hand" in Hungary, and the opportunity should not be missed, so they might as well bet on it. However, now, facts have proved that their wishful thinking is not so wishful, and their happiness is premature. The wind direction on the Danube has changed. If the Anglo-French old robbers do not change their course according to the wind, get out of Egypt, and even recklessly gamble their old lives as a last resort, then they will not only lose their fortunes like flowing water, but they may also lose their old lives. The tombstone inscription of the ten big characters "Egypt – Grave of Foreign Invaders" has already been written for the Anglo-French old robbers!

    “埃及——外国入侵者的坟墓”
    思慕
    帝国主义者在发动血腥的侵略战争的时候，总要制造一些借口、装模作样，来遮盖它的罪恶，但像这次英法帝国主义者武装侵略埃及那样赤裸裸，那样荒唐，是很少见的。
    这是百分之一百的强盗行径，但强盗还没有它们那样厚脸皮，那样丑恶。
    当它们的马前卒——以色列已经在西奈半岛杀人放火，当它们的兽机正在开罗、亚历山大轰炸屠杀埃及无辜的妇孺的时候，艾登、狄克逊（联大英国代表）、德居兰加（联大法国代表）之流，还不知羞耻地说他们的武力侵略是什么“一种紧急的警察行动”，“紧急的救火队的行动”，以“恢复法治”为目的，不是为了“制止埃及”而是为了“制止战争”。这样荒谬绝伦、睁着眼睛撒谎的强辩，比贼喊捉贼更加无耻，更加可恶。
    不错，用帝国主义的辞汇来解释，所谓“恢复法治”是说得通的。因为这两个老牌帝国主义者所要“恢复”的是“铁血宰相”所代表的“强权即公理”的法则，是殖民主义野兽所信服的“弱肉强食”的法则。
    遗憾的是，今天的世界已经不是俾斯麦时代的世界，今天的埃及既不是1882年的埃及，也不是1936年的阿比西尼亚。英法的以十二小时为限的最后通牒刚一发出，“侵略者”的三个字的黑印，已经不可磨灭地烙在艾登和摩勒的脸上。他们已经变成了“千夫所指，无疾而死”的独夫，他们已经变成了人人喊打的过街老鼠。何况，埃及巨人抗战到底的坚强意志像金字塔那样的不可动摇，阿拉伯民族和亚非人民胸中的敌忾同仇的热血像尼罗河水那样的奔腾，在他们筑起的铜墙铁壁的面前，殖民主义者卷土重来的“雄图”，只能碰个粉碎，只能像沙漠旅行者所恍惚看到的空中楼阁那样破灭。
    也许这两个老牌帝国主义者的“老谋深算”认为反革命势力已经在匈牙利占了“上风”，时机不可错过，不妨押它一宝。但是，现在，事实已经证明，它们的如意算盘并不这样如意，它们的高兴未免过早。多瑙河上的风向已经转了。如果英法老强盗还不看风转舵，滚出埃及，甚至还悍然拿老命作为孤注豪赌下去，那末它们不但将会流水似地把老本输光，而且也会可能把老命拼掉。“埃及——外国入侵者的坟墓”的十个大字的墓碑文已经为英法老强盗写好了！
