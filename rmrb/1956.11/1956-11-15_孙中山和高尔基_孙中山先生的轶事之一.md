Sun Yat-sen and Gorky
--One of the Anecdotes of Mr. Sun Yat-sen
Fang Qiren
    In 1912, after Mr. Sun Yat-sen took office as the Provisional President, the "People's Newspaper" in Brussels published his paper "The Social Significance of the Chinese Revolution." This paper aroused great interest in Lenin. He reprinted the translated version of this paper in the 17th issue of the Russian Bolshevik's organ, "Neva Star," and published a famous commentary, "Democracy and Populism in China," at the same time. In this paper, Lenin gave Sun Yat-sen extremely high praise, believing that "fighting, true democracy permeates every line of Sun Yat-sen's program," and that "before us is a truly great people's truly great system of thought."
    Sun Yat-sen, full of "noble spirit and heroic spirit," attracted the widespread attention of Russian progressives. At that time, Gorky was in exile on the island of Capri in Italy. After reading Sun Yat-sen's article, he wrote to Sun Yat-sen, asking him to write an article for the journal he edited, discussing the attitude of the Chinese people towards the predatory ambitions of European capitalists, the attitude towards the actions of Tsarist Russia, the reactions of the Chinese people to the actions of Tsarist Russia, and so on. Gorky also stated that if Sun Yat-sen himself did not have the time to write, he could ask other friends to write, but he hoped that Sun Yat-sen would personally proofread it. The letter said this:
    As a Russian, I am striving for the same ideological victory as you: no matter where this kind of thinking wins, I am fortunate for this victory, just like you. I celebrate your successful success. For you, for the Chinese Hercules (a powerful hero in Greek mythology), all sincere people are watching your work with great joy and surprise. What we Russians desire is also what you want to obtain. We are brothers in spirit and comrades in will; but the Russian government and its slaves put the Russians in a hostile position towards the Chinese. We are all socialists, sincerely believing that the whole world will be able to live their brotherly life. … We socialists must always state that there should be animosity between governments, and there should be no national hatred caused by the greed of the ruling class. …
    This uses an old translation from more than ten years ago. I don’t have the original text on hand, so it’s not easy to check, and it seems a bit awkward; however, we can still vividly feel the great internationalism spirit of the international working class and their sympathy and support for Sun Yat-sen’s cause.
    This letter was written on October 28, 1912. Unfortunately, for some unknown reason, perhaps it was lost in the mail, this letter did not reach Mr. Sun Yat-sen. At that time, it was only published in the "Overseas Life Chronicles" column of the "Contemporary Man" magazine. It was not until a year after Gorky's death that the Soviet "News" reprinted this letter, and we saw it for the first time.
    Mr. Sun Yat-sen had contact with Russian revolutionaries very early on. I think: if Sun Yat-sen had really received this letter, he would have written a new and vivid article, adding a good story to the history of Sino-Soviet friendly relations. How wonderful would that be!

    孙中山和高尔基
    ——孙中山先生的轶事之一
    方其人
    1912年，孙中山先生就任临时大总统以后，布鲁塞尔的“人民报”上，发表了他的论文“中国革命的社会意义”。这篇论文引起了列宁的极大兴趣。他将这篇论文的译文转载在俄国布尔什维克的机关报“涅瓦明星”第十七期上，并写了一篇著名的评论“中国的民主主义与民粹主义”，同时发表。在这篇论文中，列宁对孙中山予以极其崇高的评价，认为“战斗的、真实的民主主义渗透着孙逸仙政纲的每一行”，“摆在我们面前的，是一个真正伟大的人民底真正伟大的思想体系”。
    充满“高尚精神与英雄气概”的孙中山，引起了俄国先进分子的广泛注意。当时高尔基正流亡在意大利的卡普里岛，读过了孙中山的文章，写信给孙中山，请他给他所主编的刊物写一篇文章，论述中国人对于欧洲资本家掠夺野心的态度，对于沙皇俄国行动的态度，中国人对于沙皇俄国行动的反应等等。而且高尔基还说明，如果孙中山自己没有功夫写，也可以请别的朋友写，但希望孙中山亲自校阅一遍。信上是这样说的：
    予俄人也，现所争取之思想胜利与足下同：无论此种思想于何地获胜，予之以此胜为幸，亦与足下相同。予庆祝足下之美满成功，对于足下，对于中国海勾力士（希腊神话中之大力英雄），凡属忠诚之人，均以至意欢欣及惊异而注视足下之工作。我辈俄人所愿望者，亦足下所欲获得者也。我人在精神上为兄弟，在志愿上为同志；而俄国政府及其奴仆则使俄人对华人处于敌对地位。我人均系社会主义者，精诚信奉全世界将能度其兄弟生活。……我辈社会主义者，必须随时说明：当世有政府间的仇视，不应有统治阶级之贪婪所引起之民族仇恨。……
    这里用的是十多年前的老译文，手边没有原文，不便查对，显得有些疙里疙瘩；但是，伟大的国际工人阶级的国际主义精神，对于孙中山事业的同情和支持，我们依然可以生动地感觉到的。
    这封信是1912年10月28日写的。很遗憾，不知为什么原故，也许是在邮途中失落了，这封信并没有达到孙中山先生的手中，在当时只发表在“当代人”杂志的“国外生活纪事栏”。直到高尔基逝世后一年，苏联“消息报”上重刊了这封信，我们才第一次看到它。
    孙中山先生很早就与俄国的革命党人有过接触。我想：如果孙中山真地接到这封信，一定会写出一篇新的生动的文章来，为中苏友好关系史上增添一段佳话，那多好呢！
