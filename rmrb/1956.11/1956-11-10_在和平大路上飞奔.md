    Speeding on the Road of Peace
    Jin Yi
    On the left are fields full of wheat, and on the right are also fields full of wheat. A gentle breeze rolls lightly over the wheat stalks, like endless green waves in the ocean. In the center of the wheat sea is the wide and flat Peace Road, another road leading from Changchun to the automobile factory.
    Twelve Liberation brand cars brought back the cheers of tens of thousands of people in Changchun, and also brought back tens of thousands of pairs of loving eyes. Bouquets were held in the hands of everyone in the cars, colorful confetti stuck to the tips of everyone's hair, the cars honked happily, and the rhythmic engine sang lightly and movingly. Oh, what a pleasant wind, blowing on people's faces and also on their chests. Everyone wants to sing in unison, sing out the joy from the bottom of their hearts, sing out the chapter of the workers' enthusiastic labor, sing out that today the wishes of 600 million people have been realized, sing out our beloved motherland and our beloved Party.
    This Peace Road will lead to all parts of the motherland. Let the Liberation brand cars speed away wholeheartedly, let them speed away day and night! Let it rush to Tiananmen Square on National Day. Our respected Chairman Mao is standing on Tiananmen. If Chairman Mao waves his hand at it a few times, if smiles bloom on the cheeks of everyone who sees it, it will have even greater courage and strength to speed forward more jubilantly.
    Let our cars gallop on the vast Gobi Desert in the Northwest, where mirages have already landed on the ground, and emerging cities are like flowers in the desert. Let our cars fly like bees among them. Let our cars drive to the Qaidam Basin, let our cars drive to Karamay, today delivering enough food to the people prospecting for oil, and tomorrow, golden oil will flow like the endless Yangtze River into the fuel tanks of every car in the country. Let our cars pass through Golmud to Tibet, delivering tea and cloth to our brothers of the big family. Let our cars drive to the Longri Farm on the plain, delivering new agricultural tools and the greetings of tens of millions of people, and bringing back abundant new grain. Let our cars pass through roads that no one has walked on for thousands of years, startling flocks of wild animals, sending flowers and love letters to those lovely prospecting girls, and let our cars drive to the coastal defense front and the border, sending the gratitude of 600 million people and warm clothes to the soldiers who defend the motherland day and night.
    Don't forget our compatriots overseas. Let the Liberation brand cars travel across the ocean and drive to the side of the overseas Chinese. Let them sit in the cars of the motherland and gallop on foreign lands, let them spit out the pent-up boredom in their chests for many years, and let their faces shine with dazzling red light.
    Let the elderly think with emotion that China has ended the history of not being able to manufacture cars, and let the children who were born with New China recognize the Liberation brand car with the five-star on top from the day they learn to read, and be able to read "China First Automobile Manufacturing Plant" on the front of the car.
    Let our Liberation brand cars speed on the roads of peace in the world, bringing peace and happiness to the side of every peace-loving people.

    在和平大路上飞奔
    靳以
    左边是长满了麦子的田野，右边也是长满了麦子的田野，微风从麦梢上轻轻滚过去，像大海中翻动着不尽的绿色的波浪。在麦海的中央，就是那宽坦的和平大路，它是另外一条从长春通往汽车厂的道路。
    十二辆解放牌汽车，带回长春市几万人的欢呼，也带回来几万双热爱的目光。花束捧在车上每个人的手里，五彩的纸屑沾在每个人的发尖上，汽车快乐地鸣叫着，有节奏的马达，轻快而动人地在歌唱。好适意的风呵，扑着人们的脸，也扑着人们的胸膛，每个人都要齐声歌唱，唱出来心底的欢快，唱出来工人们热情劳动的篇章，唱出来今天已经实现了六万万人的愿望，唱出来我们亲爱的祖国和亲爱的党。
    这和平大路将通向祖国的各个地方，让解放牌汽车忘情地飞奔吧，让它不分昼夜地飞奔吧！让它在国庆节奔到天安门前的广场。天安门上站着我们敬爱的毛主席，要是毛主席的手向它挥两下，要是笑容在每个看到它的人的双颊上开两朵花，它就有了更大的勇气和力量，更欢腾地向前飞奔。
    让我们的汽车奔驰在西北的大戈壁上，那里海市蜃楼已经降落到地上，新兴的城市像沙漠中一朵朵的花，让我们的汽车像蜜蜂一样地在它们中间飞来飞去吧。让我们的汽车开到柴达木盆地，让我们的汽车开到克拉玛依，今天为勘采石油的人们送去足够的食粮，明天金子般的石油像不尽的长江流向全国每一辆汽车的油箱。让我们的汽车穿过了噶尔穆到了西藏，为我们大家族的兄弟送去茶叶和布匹。让我们的汽车开到了平地上的龙日农场，送去新式农具和千万人的问候，带回来丰产的新粮。让我们的汽车穿过千万年没有人行走的道路，惊散了成群的野兽，把鲜花和情书送给那些可爱的勘探的姑娘，让我们的汽车开到海防前线和国境，为日日夜夜保卫祖国的战士们送去六万万人民的感谢和御寒的衣裳。
    不要忘记我们海外的同胞呵，让解放牌汽车远渡重洋，驶到侨民的身旁。让他们坐上祖国的汽车，在异邦的土地上奔驰，让他们吐出胸中多年郁积的闷气，让他们脸上闪着炫耀的红光。
    让老年人感慨地想到中国已经结束了不能制造汽车的历史，让那些和新中国一齐诞生的孩子们，从他们识字的日子开始，就认识了顶着五星的解放牌汽车，念得出车头上“中国第一汽车制造厂”。
    让我们的解放牌汽车在世界上的和平大路上飞奔，把和平和幸福带到每个爱好和平人民的身旁。
