    Found a "Friend"
    The Egyptian Government Information Department announced that a leaflet written in Arabic was found on the body of a British paratrooper killed in Port Said. The leaflet said: "I am a British soldier, please help me return to my friends, and the British government will give you 50 pounds in cash."
    The British government wants to use the method of buying a life for 50 pounds to cheer up its cannon fodder. This is a cheap way. In fact, the British government doesn't have to spend a penny. Because, perhaps before this paratrooper's feet even touched Egyptian soil, a righteous bullet had already led him to his "friends" in hell.

    找到了“朋友”
    埃及政府情报司宣布，在塞得港一个被击毙的英国伞兵尸体身上，发现了一张用阿拉伯文写的传单。传单上说：“我是一个英国士兵，请帮助我回到我的朋友那里，英国政府将给你五十英镑现金。”
    英国政府想用五十英镑可以买到一条命的办法来给它的炮灰们打气。这是一种廉价的办法。实际上，英国政府一个钱也不用花。因为，这名伞兵的双脚也许还没有触到埃及的土地，一颗正义的子弹就已经使他找到了地狱里的“朋友”了。
