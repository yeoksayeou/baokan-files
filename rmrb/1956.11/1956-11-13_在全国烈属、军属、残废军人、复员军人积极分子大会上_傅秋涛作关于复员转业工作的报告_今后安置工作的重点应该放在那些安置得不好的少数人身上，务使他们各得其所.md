(Xinhua News Agency, 10th) Fu Qiutao, Secretary-General of the Central Transfer and Construction Committee, delivered a report this morning at the National Congress of Active Elements of Families of Martyrs, Families of Military Personnel, Disabled Servicemen, and Demobilized Soldiers on socialist construction concerning demobilization and transfer work.

傅秋涛 first congratulated the active elements present and expressed his condolences to the families of martyrs, families of military personnel, disabled servicemen, and demobilized soldiers throughout the country. Then, he spoke about the situation of demobilization and transfer work in recent years. He said that the Party and state organs, as well as the broad masses of the people, have done a lot of work in resettling demobilized and transferred military personnel. For example, those with technical expertise have been resettled accordingly; those without jobs have been helped by the government to find employment; those who were originally studying at school have been helped to return to school; if those returning to rural areas lack production tools or housing, the local government finds ways to help solve the problems; disabled servicemen have been sent to rehabilitation centers and disabled servicemen's schools to study or have been introduced to jobs. After the resettlement, the local government, especially the civil affairs departments, also organized inspection teams to further resolve the problems in the demobilization and transfer work, so that demobilized servicemen could be properly resettled and each could find their proper place. He went on to say that the significant achievements in demobilization and transfer work have played a very positive role in promoting the future implementation of the conscription system and strengthening national defense construction.

In his report, Fu Qiutao also mentioned that there are still some problems in the current demobilization and transfer work that need to be improved and resolved. He emphasized that the main reason for improper resettlement in some areas is that some cadres have a "that's good enough" mentality. They are often satisfied with the fact that more than ninety percent have been resettled well, while neglecting the small number of people who have not been resettled or have not been properly resettled. He said that in the future, the focus of our resettlement work should be on these few people, and we should arrange their work according to their specific conditions and physical condition, so that these few people who have not been resettled and are more difficult to resettle can each find their proper place.

Finally, Fu Qiutao hoped that the active elements present would assist the government in doing a good job in preferential treatment and demobilization and resettlement work in the future, and that they would help each other, encourage each other, and educate each other, so that the families of martyrs, families of military personnel, disabled servicemen, demobilized soldiers, and transferred military personnel across the country can all become active elements in socialist construction.

    在全国烈属、军属、残废军人、复员军人积极分子大会上
    傅秋涛作关于复员转业工作的报告
    今后安置工作的重点应该放在那些安置得不好的少数人身上，务使他们各得其所
    新华社10日讯　中央转业建设委员会秘书长傅秋涛今天上午在全国烈属、军属、残废军人、复员军人社会主义建设积极分子大会上作了关于复员、转业工作的报告。
    傅秋涛首先向到会积极分子祝贺，并向全国烈士家属，军人家属，残废军人，复员军人表示慰问，接着他讲到了几年来复员、转业工作的情况。他说，党和国家机关以及广大人民群众对复员、转业军人的安置，作了许多工作。如对有技术专长的，分别进行了安置；对没有职业的，政府负责介绍职业；原来在学校读书的，帮助他们复学；回到农村的，如果缺乏生产工具或房屋，地方政府设法帮助解决；残废军人，被送入教养院和残废军人学校学习或给介绍职业，在安置之后，地方政府特别是民政部门，还组织检查组，进一步解决复员、转业工作中的问题，使复员军人得到妥善安置，各得其所。他接着说，复员、转业工作取得的重大成绩，对今后推行义务兵役制，加强国防建设，起了极为良好的作用。
    傅秋涛在报告中还讲到了目前复员、转业工作中还有些问题须要加以改善和解决。他着重指出，有些地区安置不妥的主要原因，是有些干部存在着“差不多”的思想。他们常以百分之九十几都安置好了为满足，而忽略少数人尚未安置或安置不妥。他说，今后我们安置工作的重点应该放在这些少数人身上，并且根据他们的具体条件，身体情况，来安置他们的工作，使这些少数没有得到安置和比较难安置的人各得其所。
    傅秋涛最后希望到会的积极分子今后要协助政府作好优抚和复员安置工作，并要互相帮助、互相勉励、互相教育，使全国烈属、军属、残废军人、复员军人、转业军人都能成为社会主义建设中的积极分子。
