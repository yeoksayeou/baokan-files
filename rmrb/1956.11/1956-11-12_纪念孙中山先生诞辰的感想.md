Thoughts on Commemorating the Birthday of Mr. Sun Yat-sen
	Zhu Yunshan

What is most worthy of our learning from Mr. Sun Yat-sen is his spirit of tireless revolution and continuous progress throughout his life. When commemorating the first anniversary of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's death, Mr. Lu Xun wrote a few words, saying: "Mr. Sun Yat-sen's life history is there, standing out in the world is revolution, failure is still revolution, he was never satisfied or at ease after the Xinhai Revolution, and continued to advance towards complete revolutionary work." He also said: "He is a whole and forever revolutionist, no matter what he does, it is all revolution, he finally took the lead in leading new revolutionaries forward, working together towards complete revolutionary work."

How do we understand Mr. Sun Yat-sen's spirit of continuous progress? I think we can only confirm it from his life's revolutionary historical deeds. In his early years, he traveled with Lu Haodong to Beijing and Tianjin, and was stimulated by the Sino-Japanese War of Jiawu. He then went to Honolulu to establish the Xingzhonghui (Revive China Society), and launched the first armed uprising in Guangzhou the following year. After several setbacks, his ambition did not wane. In 1905, he established the Chinese Revolutionary Alliance (Tongmenghui) in Tokyo, Japan. After countless failures, he persevered and finally overthrew the Qing Dynasty rule in 1911, ending the two-thousand-year feudal monarchy. In 1912, Lenin praised him in the "Neva Star" newspaper as "a revolutionary democrat, full of the noble spirit and heroism inherent in such a class, this class is not going downhill, but going uphill, not afraid of the future, but believing in the future, and fighting for the future regardless of personal safety." These words illustrate Lenin's foresight and encouragement for the Chinese revolution at that time, and also illustrate Mr. Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary spirit and revolutionary direction, which would not stop at a certain stage.

Furthermore, why did the Xinhai Revolution fail? We can find its factors from within the revolution. It should be known that in the era when the Tongmenghui was led by Mr. Sun Yat-sen, patriotic elements at home and abroad were concentrated under Mr. Sun Yat-sen's banner to carry out the revolution, reaching a climax, which can be said to be a golden age. The internal was unified, pure, and the goal was consistent. After the Wuchang Uprising, everyone knew that the Qing Dynasty was gone, and speculators drilled in, and the problem came. For example, in the Hunan Uprising, Jiao Dafeng and Chen Zuoxin made the greatest contributions. At that time, bureaucrats and gentry created a mutiny, causing Jiao and Chen to be killed at the same time, and the fruits of the revolution fell into the hands of the gentry. After the restoration of other provinces, there were countless incidents of vying for power and profit, and mutual infighting. At this time, many revolutionary figures were corrupted by the Northern Warlords and remnants of the imperial system, mistakenly believing that once the Qing Dynasty fell, the world would be peaceful. After the Song Jiaoren case occurred, Mr. Sun Yat-sen advocated immediate punishment of Yuan, but the Kuomintang governors acted as if nothing had happened and did not move their troops; by the time Yuan Shikai had made arrangements and canceled them, they then came to raise troops to punish Yuan, but it was too late. However, Mr. Sun Yat-sen was always clear-headed, and he continued to advance, failing to punish Yuan, fleeing to Tokyo, Japan, reorganizing the Chinese Revolutionary Party, regrouping, and restarting the struggle with the Northern Warlords and domestic and foreign enemies.

From the Guichou punitive expedition against Yuan to the various campaigns to protect the constitution and punish the traitors, this period of Mr. Sun Yat-sen was the most difficult period of his life. The Northern and Southern warlords colluded with each other, and fought each other in mixed battles. Bureaucratic politicians attached themselves to the warlords and served as their tools. The most unforgivable traitor, Chen Jiongming, colluded with Wu Peifu to obstruct the Northern Expedition, and even committed the rebellious act of shelling Guanyin Mountain. But Mr. Sun Yat-sen was an optimist, and he never heard that he was discouraged. He never stopped his revolutionary work for a day, and sometimes he engaged in writing for the revolutionary work, and often had a book in his hand.

In his later years, Mr. Sun Yat-sen's thinking developed to its highest degree. Influenced by the October Revolution, in 1922 he accepted the suggestion of the Chinese Communist Party, and he resolutely cooperated with the Communist Party, reorganized the Kuomintang, re-explained the Three Principles of the People, established the united front of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, and decided on the three major policies of alliance with Russia, alliance with the Communist Party, and assistance to peasants and workers. At that time, a group of conservative and stubborn elements within the Kuomintang strongly opposed it. Mr. Sun Yat-sen said to them: "If you do not agree, I can dissolve the Kuomintang in the future, and I will join the Communist Party alone." This is a crucial event in the history of the Chinese revolution. In his last letter to the Soviet Union, he said: "This free republic of great union is the true legacy of the immortal Lenin to the oppressed peoples of the world. The refugees under imperialism will borrow this to defend their freedom and seek liberation from the international system based on ancient slavery, war, prejudice." He also said: "I would like to express my ardent hope that the dawn will soon break, when the Soviet Union will welcome a strong and independent China as a good friend and ally." This is not only the cornerstone of revolutionary friendship between China and the Soviet Union, but also an important inspiration for oppressed nations to seek liberation from the imperialist slavery system. He openly declared to the outside world for the Guangdong Merchant Corps incident: "A period will now begin, to strive to overthrow the interference of imperialism in China. To eliminate the biggest obstacles to the completion of the historical task of the revolution." It is enough to see his great and clear spirit in the anti-imperialist struggle. He shouted "Peace, struggle to save China" on his deathbed, and such a great spirit of patriotism is forever indelible.

    纪念孙中山先生诞辰的感想
    朱蕴山
    中山先生最值得我们学习的地方，就是他一生革命不疲倦不断前进的精神。鲁迅先生在中山先生逝世一周年纪念时曾写几句话，他说：“中山先生一生的历史具在，站出世间来就是革命，失败了还是革命，辛亥革命后也没有满足过，没有安逸过，仍然继续着进向于完全革命工作”。他又说：“他是个全体永远革命者，无论他做哪一件，全都是革命，他终于带头领着新的革命者前行，一同努力进向于完全的革命工作”。
    我们怎样认识中山先生不断前进的精神呢？我想只有从他一生革命历史事迹来证实他。早年他偕陆皓东北游京津，因受甲午中日战争刺激，旋赴檀香山创立兴中会，次年即在广州发动第一次武装暴动，几经挫折，至1905年在日本东京建立中国革命同盟会，复经无数次失败，其志不衰，再接再厉，终于1911年推翻了清朝统治，结束了两千年封建帝制。1912年列宁在“涅瓦明星”报上称赞他“是革命的民主主义者，是充满着这样一个阶级所固有的高尚精神与英雄气概，这个阶级不是在下山，而是在上山，不是惧怕将来，而是相信将来，奋不顾身地为将来而斗争”。从这些话中说明了当年列宁对于中国革命的预见和鼓舞，同时也说明了中山先生的革命气概和革命方向，是不会停留在某一阶段的。
    再说到辛亥革命为什么会失败呢？我们可从革命内部找出他的因素。要知同盟会在中山先生领导的那一时代，海内外一般爱国分子都集中在中山先生旗帜下进行革命，达到了高潮，可说是个黄金时代，内部是统一的，单纯的，目标是一致的。武昌起义，人人皆知清朝大势已去，投机分子钻进来，问题就来了。类如湖南起义是焦达峰、陈作新两位首功。当时官僚豪绅，制造兵变，使焦陈两位同时遇害，革命果实落到豪绅之手。其他各省光复，争权攘利，互相倾轧之事，不胜枚举。这时候，许多革命人物，多被北洋军阀和帝制余孽所腐蚀，误认清朝一倒，天下就可太平无事。宋教仁案发生，中山先生主张立即讨袁，而国民党都督们却若无其事，按兵不动；等到袁世凯布置好了，取消他们的时候，他们才来兴兵讨袁，这时已来不及了。但中山先生始终是头脑清醒，他仍继续前进，讨袁失败，流亡日本东京，改组中华革命党，重整旗鼓，与北洋军阀及内外敌人重新开始斗争。
    从癸丑讨袁一直到护法讨贼各役这一时期的中山先生，是平生最辛苦的时期。南北军阀，相互勾结，又相互混战，官僚政客依附军阀，替他们做御用工具。最不可饶恕的叛徒陈炯明，与吴佩孚勾结阻挠北伐，竟至发生炮打观音山的叛逆行为。但中山先生是个乐观主义者，从未听说他灰过心，他对革命工作从未停过一天，有时他还为了革命工作从事著述，而且常常手不释卷。
    中山先生到了晚年，他的思想发展是到了最高度，他受十月革命影响，1922年接受中国共产党建议，他即毅然决然与共产党合作，改组国民党，重行解释三民主义，建立国共联合战线，决定联俄、联共、扶助农工三大政策。是时国民党内一批保守和顽固分子反对甚烈，中山先生对他们说：“如果你们不赞成的话，我将来可以解散国民党，我自己一个人加入共产党”。这是中国革命史中有关键性的事件。他临终致苏联遗书上说：“此自由的共和国大联合，是不朽的列宁遗与被压迫民族的世界之真遗产。帝国主义下的难民，将借此以保卫其自由，从以古代奴役战争偏私为基础之国际制度中谋解放。”他又说：“我愿表示我热烈的希望，希望不久即将破晓，斯时苏联以良友及盟国而欢迎强盛独立之中国”。这不仅是中苏两国革命友好的奠基石，而且是被压迫民族从帝国主义奴役制度中谋求解放的一个重要的启发。他为广东商团事件对外宣言公开的说：“今将开始一时期。为努力推翻帝国主义之干涉中国。扫除完成革命之历史的工作之最大障碍。”足以看出他反帝国主义斗争中伟大的鲜明的气魄。他在临终犹大呼“和平奋斗救中国”，这样伟大的爱国主义的精神是永远不可磨灭的。
