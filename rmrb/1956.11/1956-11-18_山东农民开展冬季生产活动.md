Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 15th. After basically completing the autumn harvest and planting, grassroots cadres in rural areas of Shandong Province, after criticizing the lax idea of ​​"the weather is warm, and winter production can be started later," are actively leading agricultural cooperatives to carry out various winter production activities.

From mid-October to now, the province has already winter-plowed more than 8.24 million mu of land. Liaocheng, Huimin, Tai'an, and three other special districts had only winter-plowed 2.45 million mu of land a week ago. After strengthening leadership, this has now increased to nearly 6 million mu. Many agricultural cooperatives have improved the soil by using deep plowing, deep digging, and other methods while carrying out winter plowing.

During the farmland water conservancy projects undertaken in the spring and summer of this year in Shandong Province, some poorly constructed water wells were dug. Now, various places are gradually repairing these water wells. Linqing, Guanxian, Jiyang, and other counties have heightened the well platforms or dug them deeper for more than 2,800 old wells. Agricultural cooperatives in some areas have already begun to construct new water conservancy projects.

Initial management work on wheat fields is also being carried out preliminarily in various places. According to statistics from only Huimin, Guangrao, and four other counties, more than 131,000 mu of wheat have been irrigated.

    山东农民开展冬季生产活动
    新华社济南15日电　秋收秋种基本结束，山东省各地农村基层干部在批判了“天气暖和，冬季生产可以晚点动手”的松劲思想以后，积极领导农业社开展各项冬季生产活动。
    从10月中旬到现在，全省已经冬耕土地八百二十四万多亩。聊城、惠民、泰安等五个专区，在一周前仅冬耕土地二百四十五万亩，经过加强领导以后，现在已经增加到近六百万亩。许多农业社在进行冬耕的同时，用深耕、深刨等方法改良了土壤。
    山东省在今年春夏的兴修农田水利工程中，曾经打了一些质量不好的水井，现在各地正在逐渐整修这些水井。临清、冠县、济阳等县已经把两千八百多眼旧井加高了井台或者掏得更深。有些地方的农业社已经着手兴修新的水利工程。
    麦田的初期管理工作也在各地初步开展。仅据惠民、广饶等六个县统计，就已浇麦十三万一千多亩。
