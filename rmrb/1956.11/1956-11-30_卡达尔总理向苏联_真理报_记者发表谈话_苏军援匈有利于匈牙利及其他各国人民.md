Xinhua News Agency, 29th. TASS, Moscow: "Pravda" published on November 29th a talk given by Janos Kadar, Prime Minister of the Hungarian Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Government, to reporters from "Pravda" and "Komsomolskaya Pravda" on November 26th.

Regarding the question of Soviet troops stationed in Hungary, Kadar said: As everyone knows, Soviet troops are stationed in Hungary in accordance with treaties and agreements signed by the Hungarian government and approved by the parliament. Soviet troops helped our country defeat the counter-revolutionary forces within the country at the request of the Hungarian government. I should tell you that the decision to allow Soviet troops to help the Hungarian people was not an easy one for either the Hungarian government or the Soviet government. Why, you ask? Because we knew very well that the enemy's propaganda would use this to slander the Soviet Union for interfering in our internal affairs. For the Soviet government, this not only meant paying a price in manpower and material resources, but also bearing a moral responsibility. However, after careful consideration of all these circumstances, the Hungarian government finally decided to make a request for assistance, and the Soviet government, after careful consideration, decided to provide this assistance, which shows that this assistance was very necessary.

This assistance from the Soviet government to the Hungarian people not only meant that they fulfilled their treaty obligations, but also that they had a deep understanding of our complex situation. The Soviet government not only helped us stop the bloodshed in Hungary, prevented the restoration of capitalism in our country, but also prevented the emergence of a source of war, which was originally very possible. Is there a real danger of a new war? Without a doubt, there is.

Kadar pointed out that it is quite obvious that if the counter-revolutionaries had seized power in our country, they would have taken up arms against other countries the next day. This is not difficult to understand. It can be seen that the Soviet Union's assistance to Hungary is also beneficial to other countries, saving them from the threat of war. Another aspect of this issue must also be mentioned. As everyone knows, for eight years there has been an army in West Germany composed of various Horthy remnants and military police. They have been equipped and armed. The real purpose of this army has been revealed in recent events. This army was used to aid the Hungarian reactionaries. If these people seized power, they would have done anything at the behest of their foreign masters. This should never be forgotten.

Hungary Rejects Hammarskjöld's Visit

Kadar then spoke about the question of UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld and UN observers coming to Hungary. He said that foreign newspapers have talked a lot about this issue. Why did we reject this suggestion of a visit? It is due to considerations of legal rights.

The Hungarian events are our internal affairs, and we want to safeguard our sovereignty. However, there is another aspect to the issue. The ceasefire on October 30th was a unilateral ceasefire – the counter-revolutionaries did not cease fire, but intensified their bloodshed and atrocities. And when they were counterattacked, when they were so-called "in trouble," all the calls of the counter-revolutionaries boiled down to one point: hold on, the American troops are coming, hold on, the UN forces are coming. In many people's minds, the distinction between American troops and UN forces disappeared. Therefore, the very fact that any kind of UN representative comes to Hungary could bring confusion to people's minds. Certain elements will certainly not lay down their weapons. At a time when we are working towards unity, such confusion is a step backwards. Besides, what is the need for observers? During this period, there were more than six hundred foreign journalists in Hungary, who saw everything, and there were no secrets from them. When the armed resistance was eliminated and everything was clear, they had scattered and returned. As for the UN Secretary-General, he has been provided with a sufficient amount of data, documents, and testimonies. We suggested that our representatives meet with the UN Secretary-General in Rome, but the meeting did not take place later, which is not our fault.

Government Policy is to Unite the People's Strength

Speaking of some issues related to the internal situation in Hungary, Kadar said that our basic policy is to unite all the people's strength and move forward. Of course, we will encounter obstacles on this road, but we are fully determined to eliminate everything that hinders our unity. We know that there are counter-revolutionaries, and there are also people who have lost their way for a while, especially among intellectuals, who have various political and economic demands under various influences. Some of these demands are concocted out of thin air, and they hinder our unity. We have pointed out that these demands are unfounded. We have learned the lesson of the Nagy government and know what the result will be of fulfilling these reactionary demands. However, there are also completely reasonable demands raised by the working people, but these demands cannot be realized at present. These demands cannot be realized before life has returned to normal and national order has been restored. We are producing very little right now. How can we satisfy, for example, the demand for increased wages? Of course, we can turn on the printing press and print banknotes, but banknotes need to be guaranteed by goods, which means work. We will work, we will straighten things out, and then we can study expanding the members of the government and economic issues.

### 卡达尔总理向苏联“真理报”记者发表谈话  苏军援匈有利于匈牙利及其他各国人民

    卡达尔总理向苏联“真理报”记者发表谈话
    苏军援匈有利于匈牙利及其他各国人民
    新华社29日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：“真理报”在11月29日发表了匈牙利工农革命政府总理亚诺什·卡达尔在11月26日对“真理报”和“共青团真理报”记者的谈话。
    卡达尔谈到苏联在匈牙利境内驻军的问题时说：大家知道，苏联军队是按照匈牙利政府所签署并经议会批准的条约和协定驻留在匈牙利的。苏联军队帮助我国击溃国内的反革命势力，是由于匈牙利政府的请求。我应该告诉大家，决定让苏联军队来帮助匈牙利人民，无论对匈牙利政府和对苏联政府说来，都不是一件轻而易举的事。你们问，为什么？因为我们很清楚地知道，敌人的宣传会利用这一点来诬蔑苏联干涉我国内政。对于苏联政府说来，这不仅要付出人力、物力的代价，而且还要承担道义上的责任。然而，匈牙利政府对这一切情况经过慎重考虑以后，终于决定提出了请求帮助的要求，苏联政府也在经过慎重考虑以后，决定给予这种帮助，这就说明，这种帮助是非常必要的。
    苏联政府对匈牙利人民的这种帮助不仅意味着他们履行了条约规定的义务，而且也意味着他们已经深刻地理解到我们的复杂情况。苏联政府不仅帮助我们制止了匈牙利的流血情况，阻挠了资本主义在我国的复辟，而且防止了一个战争来源地的出现，而这原来是十分可能的。是否存在着新战争的现实危险呢？毫无疑问，是存在的。
    卡达尔指出，十分明显，如果反革命在我国夺取了政权，那么第二天它就会手持武器反对其他国家。这是不难理解的。由此可见，苏联对匈牙利的援助也有利于其他国家，使它们免遭战争威胁。也不能不提一下这个问题的另一面。大家知道，八年来在西德有一支由各种霍尔蒂残部和宪兵编成的军队。它们被配备起来，武装起来。这支军队的真正目的在最近的事件中表现出来了。这支军队是用来援助匈牙利反动派的。如果这些人夺取了政权，那么他们就会遵照外国主子的命令，什么事情都干得出来的。这一点是永远不应当忘记的。
    匈拒绝哈马舍尔德访问
    卡达尔接着谈到关于联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德和联合国观察员到匈牙利来的问题。他说，国外的报纸对这一个问题谈得很多。我们为什么拒绝这种访问的建议呢？是由于法权方面的考虑。
    匈牙利事件是我们的内政，我们要维护我们的主权。但是，还有问题的另一方面。10月30日的停火是单方面的停火——反革命分子没有停火，反而变本加厉地制造流血和暴行。而当他们遭到反击，当他们所谓“陷入困境”的时候，反革命的一切号召都归到一点上去：再坚持一下，美国军队就要到了，再坚持一下，联合国部队就要到了。在许多人的概念中，美国军队和联合国部队之间的区别消失了。因此，不论联合国的那一种代表到匈牙利来这一事实本身也可能给人们的头脑带来混乱。某些分子是一定不会放下武器的。当我们在致力于团结工作的时刻，这样的混乱是一种后退。再说，又何必要观察员呢，这个时期里有六百多个外国记者在匈牙利，他们看到了一切事情，对他们没有秘密。当武装反抗被消灭，一切已很清楚的时候，他们已四散回去了。至于说联合国秘书长，那末已向他提供了足够数量的资料、文件、证词。我们建议我们的代表和联合国秘书长在罗马会见，但是后来没有举行会见，这就不能怪我们了。
    政府方针是团结人民力量
    在讲到有关匈牙利内部情况的一些问题时，卡达尔说，我们的基本方针是团结一切人民的力量，向前迈进。当然，在这条道路上我们会碰到障碍，但是我们完全有决心消灭一切妨碍我们团结的东西。我们知道，有反革命分子，也有一时迷失了方向的人，尤其是在知识分子当中在各种影响之下产生了各种政治的和经济的要求。其中某些要求是凭空想出来的，它们妨碍着我们的团结。我们已经指出这些要求是没有根据的。我们记取了纳吉政府的教训，知道实现这些反动的要求将会得到一个什么样的结果。但是，也有劳动人民提出的完全合理的要求，可是这些要求在目前是不能实现的。在生活尚未正常，国家秩序尚未恢复以前，这些要求是不可能实现的。我们现在生产的东西还很少。怎么能满足，譬如，增加工资的要求呢？当然，可以开足印刷机，印制纸币，但是纸币原是需要有商品来保障的，这就是说，需要工作。我们将工作，将整顿秩序，那时就可以研究扩大政府成员和经济问题。
