    Xinhua News Agency, 5th - "Voice of Britain" radio station in Cyprus said today that British and French paratroop forces landed in the Suez Canal area.

    British and French troops took off from Cyprus before dawn, focusing their attack on Port Said, Ismailia, and Suez. (Note: Suez and Port Said are at opposite ends of the 110-mile long Suez Canal, with Ismailia in the middle.)

    According to an announcement by the Egyptian military spokesman in Cairo, the British and French paratroopers who landed in the Port Said area this morning have been completely annihilated.

    Xinhua News Agency, 5th - Cairo News: Egyptian naval forces sank a 7,000-ton French cruiser in Egyptian territorial waters north of the Nile Delta on the morning of November 4th.

    An Egyptian military communique stated that Egyptian naval light vessels bravely attacked a French cruiser on the morning of November 4th, and the French cruiser sank after being hit and catching fire.

    The communique stated that the French cruiser had a crew of 600 officers and men, including a fleet commander.

    The cruiser was sunk as it attempted to approach the Egyptian coast in the Lake Burullus area. Lake Burullus is between Alexandria and Port Said. In recent days, British and French naval and air forces have been actively operating near the coast in this area.

    The Egyptian military's 21st communique, issued on November 4th, stated that, to date, the Egyptian armed forces have sunk two British and French destroyers and one cruiser, damaged three destroyers, and captured some small vessels.

    Xinhua News Agency, 5th - Damascus Radio reported on the 4th that President Nasser had told the U.S. Ambassador to Egypt that Egypt intends to defend Cairo, "even if it becomes another Stalingrad."

    The radio station said that President Nasser made this statement during a meeting with the U.S. Ambassador, Mr. Hare.

    Xinhua News Agency, 5th - Tel Aviv News: Israeli radio broadcast on November 4th that Israeli troops have advanced to within three miles of the Suez Canal.

    According to an Associated Press report, Egyptian armed forces are continuing to fight in the Gaza Strip behind the Israeli troops. The Israeli army's mopping-up operations in the Gaza Strip are constantly being attacked by Egyptian snipers.

    Xinhua News Agency, 5th - According to a communique issued by the Egyptian military, on November 4th, Egyptian armed forces opened fire on French warships near the Egyptian coast north of the Nile Delta. At the same time, the British and French air forces continued to bomb Egyptian towns, and the Egyptian air defense forces bravely fought back, shooting down seven British and French aircraft.

    According to the 22nd communique issued by the Egyptian military, the damage caused by the British and French air force bombings on November 4th is as follows:

    "1. Some materials were burned in Mazalla and Port Fouad;
    2. The Firdan Bridge over the Suez Canal was damaged;
    3. A church in Alexandria was destroyed, two people were killed, and twelve were injured."

    While continuously bombing Cairo, the British and French air forces also dropped leaflets in Cairo on the evening of November 3rd, threatening the Egyptian people to accept British and French demands, otherwise, they would expand the bombing of innocent civilians. The three million citizens of Cairo responded to this threat with redoubled determination and calmness. On the morning of November 4th, when the air raid siren sounded, the citizens were still calmly eating breakfast, and many even ran to the windows and balconies to watch the heroic Egyptian anti-aircraft artillery forces pursue a twin-engine jet enemy aircraft. Propaganda vehicles equipped with loudspeakers also constantly patrolled the city early that morning. The leaflets distributed by the vehicles stated: We are all willing to die for Egypt; We are all soldiers; We believe in our strength, our firm faith, and our rights; Darkness and air raids, Britain and France cannot frighten us.

    英法在塞得港着陆伞兵全部被歼
    埃及海军部队击沉一艘法国巡洋舰
    新华社5日讯　在塞浦路斯岛的“英国之音”广播电台今天说，英法伞兵部队在苏伊士运河地区着陆。
    英法军队在黎明前从塞浦路斯起飞，进攻的重点是塞得港、伊士美利亚和苏伊士城。（按：苏伊士城和塞得港在一百十英里长的苏伊士运河两端，伊士美利亚在运河中间。）
    据开罗埃及军方发言人宣布，今天早晨在塞得港地区着陆的英法伞兵已全部被歼灭。
    新华社5日讯　开罗消息：埃及海军部队11月4日上午在尼罗河三角洲以北的埃及领海中击沉了一艘七千吨的法国巡洋舰。
    埃及军方的公报说，埃及海军轻型舰艇在11月4日早晨英勇地袭击了一艘法国巡洋舰，法国巡洋舰在中弹起火后沉没。
    公报说，这艘法国巡洋舰上共有官兵六百人，有舰队司令一人。
    这艘巡洋舰是当它企图在布鲁卢斯湖地区接近埃及海岸时被击沉的。布鲁卢斯湖在亚历山大城与塞得港之间。近日英法海空军在这个地区的海岸附近活动频繁。
    埃及军方11月4日发表的第二十一号公报说，到目前为止，埃及武装部队已经击沉了英法的两艘驱逐舰和一艘巡洋舰，击伤三艘驱逐舰，俘获了一些小型船只。
    新华社5日讯　大马士革电台4日报道，纳赛尔总统已经告诉美国驻埃及大使，埃及打算保卫开罗，“即使它要成为另一个斯大林格勒”。
    电台说，纳赛尔总统是在同美国大使赫尔会谈的时候这样说的。
    新华社5日讯　特拉维夫消息：以色列电台11月4日广播说，以色列军队已经推进到离开苏伊士运河三英里的地方。
    据美联社消息报道，在以色列军队后方，埃及武装力量正在加沙地带继续坚持战斗。以色列军队在加沙地带的扫荡行动不断受到埃及狙击兵的袭击。
    新华社5日讯　据埃及军方发表的公报，11月4日埃及武装部队在尼罗河三角洲以北的埃及海岸附近向法国军舰开火。同时，英法空军继续对埃及各城镇施行轰炸，埃及空防部队奋勇迎击，击落英法飞机七架。
    据埃及军方第二十二号公报公布，11月4日英法飞机轰炸所造成的损害如下：
    “一、在马札和福德港烧毁了一些物资；
    二、炸坏了苏伊士运河上的佛登桥；
    三、在亚历山大城炸毁了一个教堂，两个人被炸死，十二人受伤。”
    英法空军在连续不断轰炸开罗的同时，11月3日晚上又在开罗投掷传单，威胁埃及人民接受英法的要求，否则就要扩大对无辜平民的轰炸。开罗三百万市民以加倍的坚定和镇静回答了这种威胁。11月4日一早当空袭警报发出后，市民仍然在安静地用早饭，许多人还跑到窗口和阳台上注视英勇的埃及高射炮部队追击一架双引擎喷气式敌机。装着扩音器的宣传鼓动车这天一早也不断地在市内来往巡行。车上散发的传单说：我们都愿意为埃及而死；我们每个人都是战士；我们相信自己的力量、我们坚强的信心和我们的权利；黑暗和空袭、英国和法国都吓不倒我们。
