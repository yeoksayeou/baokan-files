Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 25th. Engineering and technical personnel at the Shenyang Mining Machinery Plant have uncovered a huge potential for saving steel by reviewing the design drawings of large products. Recently, the plant modified the designs of three machine components, saving the country seventeen tons of steel.

The review of design drawings at this factory was collectively led by more than ten key engineering and technical personnel. They held specialized technical meetings, absorbing relevant engineering and technical personnel from various workshops and departments to jointly discuss projects for improving product designs. Through free debate, they made technical appraisals of the design improvements. In this way, in just over a week, they put forward seventy-two technical improvement suggestions on ten large products such as gas generators and magnetic separators.

This design review focused on products with large production quantities and high output value this year and next, or products that will be produced for a long time, because these products were all designed a long time ago. Due to the continuous improvement of the world's scientific and technological level and the current shortage of steel in our country, many of these products' designs are no longer reasonable. Many machine components, which could have been manufactured with ordinary steel and thin steel plates, were made with expensive alloy steel and thick steel plates; some components did not need to be so precise, but strict requirements were made. Redesigning these products can save a lot of steel.

    从产品设计中发掘节约潜力
    沈阳矿山机器厂复查设计图纸节约钢材十七吨
    据新华社沈阳25日电　沈阳矿山机器厂工程技术人员通过复查大型产品的设计图纸，发掘了节约钢铁的巨大潜力。最近这个厂在三种机器部件上修改了设计，就给国家节约了十七吨钢材。
    这个工厂复查设计图纸的工作，是由工厂的十多名主要工程技术人员集体领导进行的。他们召开了专业性的技术会议，吸收各车间、科室的有关工程技术人员，共同讨论改进产品设计的项目，并且通过自由争论，作出改进设计的技术鉴定。这样，只用了一周多的时间，就在煤气发生炉、磁选机等十种大型产品上，提出了七十二项技术改进的意见。
    这次复查设计是以今年和明年生产数量多、产值高或将长久生产的产品为重点，因为这些产品都是很早以前设计的。由于世界科学技术水平不断提高，以及目前我国钢铁缺少，这些产品的不少设计已经不合理了。有不少机器部件，本来可以用普通钢和薄钢板制造，却用了贵重的合金钢和厚钢板；有些部件本来不需要那么精密，却要求很严。重新修改这些产品的设计，就可以节约大量钢材。
