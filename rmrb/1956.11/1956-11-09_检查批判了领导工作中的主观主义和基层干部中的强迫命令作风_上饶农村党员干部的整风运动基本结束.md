Xinhua News Agency Report: The rectification movement against subjectivism, bureaucratism, and coercive commandism, launched by the CCP Jiangxi Provincial Shangrao Regional Committee among rural party members and cadres in the entire region, has basically concluded and has achieved some preliminary experiences.

The rectification movement in the Shangrao region began in August and was carried out in two phases. The first phase involved concentrating the main cadres of the townships and agricultural cooperatives in the counties for rectification study. After the rectification in the counties concluded, the second phase was carried out in the townships, with the cadres who had undergone rectification as the core, under the guidance of the county party committee's regional divisions, among all party members and cadres above the level of production team leader in the agricultural cooperatives. At the same time, member representative conferences were held and member families were visited to solicit opinions from the members on party members and cadres.

The method of rectification was to start with a review of the overall work of the county, township, and cooperative, and to carry out criticism and self-criticism on the basis of enhancing ideological understanding through studying the CCP Central Committee's decision on improving leadership methods and other documents. First, subjectivism and bureaucratism in the work of the leadership departments were reviewed and criticized. For example, Wannian and Leping counties focused on criticizing the county party committee for formulating the county's production plan this year without investigation and research, blindly deploying plans for thousand-catty rice areas, thousand-catty townships, and thousand-catty cooperatives. When the lower levels raised objections to these unrealistic plans, they were instead accused of being "right-leaning and conservative." Guixi County criticized the county party committee for subjectively deploying the promotion of "three-four-two-five" rice varieties, resulting in serious production reductions after some water-deficient paddy fields that were unsuitable for planting were converted. Secondly, the coercive commandism of grassroots party members and cadres was further criticized, pointing out that these coercive commandism behaviors were mainly caused by the patriarchal management methods of rural party members and cadres, the lack of experience in managing the collective economy, and the subjectivism in the work of higher-level leaders. Therefore, the rectification emphasized the spirit of focusing on education to improve and improve work methods. Erring party members and cadres were generally not punished as long as they made sincere confessions to the organization and the masses. The cadres who participated in the rectification generally reflected: "After this rectification, it was like attending a training class." During the rectification, various localities also selected a group of outstanding workers to specifically spread their work methods to all party members and cadres.

In order to consolidate the achievements of this rectification movement, the CCP Shangrao local organizations and government departments at all levels are improving their work methods, implementing the spirit of democratic management of agricultural cooperatives, and are beginning to rectify and strengthen the party branch education work, organizing party members and cadres to study the "Eighth National Congress" documents in order to continuously improve the policy thinking and theoretical level of party members and cadres.

### 检查批判了领导工作中的主观主义和基层干部中的强迫命令作风  上饶农村党员干部的整风运动基本结束

    检查批判了领导工作中的主观主义和基层干部中的强迫命令作风
    上饶农村党员干部的整风运动基本结束
    新华社讯　中共江西省上饶地方委员会在全区农村党员、干部中开展的反对主观主义、官僚主义和强迫命令作风的整风运动，已经基本结束，初步取得了一些经验。
    上饶地区的整风运动从8月份开始后，分作两批进行。第一批将乡和农业社的主要干部集中到县里进行整风学习；在县里的整风结束以后，第二批以乡为单位，以经过整风的干部为核心，在县委分片指导下，在全体党员和农业社生产队长以上的干部中进行整风，同时召开社员代表大会和访问社员家庭，征求社员对党员和干部的意见。
    整风的方式是从检查县、乡、社的全面工作入手，在学习中共中央关于改进领导方法的决定等文件提高了思想认识的基础上，开展批评与自我批评。首先对领导部门工作中的主观主义和官僚主义进行了检查和批判。如万年、乐平两县着重批评了县委在制定今年全县生产计划时，不经过调查研究，盲目布置水稻千斤区、千斤乡、千斤社的计划，而当下边对这些不切合实际的计划提出意见时，反被认为“右倾保守”等。贵溪县批评县委主观地布置推广“三四二五”水稻品种，使一些不宜于种植的缺水稻田改种后造成严重减产的结果。其次，进一步批判了基层党员、干部中的强迫命令作风，指出这些强迫命令作风主要是农村党员、干部家长式的管理方法，缺乏管理集体经济的经验，以及上级领导工作中的主观主义所造成的。因此，整风中强调贯彻了以教育提高和改进工作方法为主的精神，对犯错误的党员干部，只要他们向组织和群众做出诚恳交代，一般都没有给予处分。参加整风的干部普遍反映：“经过这次整风，像进了一次训练班”。整风中，各地还评选出一批优秀工作者，向全体党员干部具体地传播他们的工作方法。
    为了巩固这次整风运动的成果，中共上饶地方各级组织和政府部门正在改进工作方法，贯彻农业社民主办社精神，并且着手整顿和加强党的支部教育工作，组织党员、干部学习“八大”文件，以不断提高党员和干部的政策思想和理论水平。
