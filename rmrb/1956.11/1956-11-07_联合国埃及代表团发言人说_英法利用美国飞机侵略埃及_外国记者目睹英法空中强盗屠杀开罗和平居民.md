Xinhua News Agency, November 6th, TASS New York dispatch: The spokesman for the Egyptian delegation to the United Nations told reporters last night that, according to news he had just received from Cairo, an American-made "Wildcat" fighter plane was shot down in Egyptian airspace. The Egyptian spokesman said that the plane bore the markings of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and belonged to "the type of aircraft that the United States supplied to Britain and France under the Atlantic Treaty."

The Egyptian spokesman added that if American armaments supplied to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization are used to massacre peaceful residents of Egypt, Algeria, or elsewhere, then the Egyptian government will most solemnly demand that this matter be considered.

Xinhua News Agency, November 6th, TASS Cairo, November 5th dispatch: Foreign journalists stationed in Cairo visited several places on November 3rd that had been subjected to air raids by British and French aircraft the day before.

In Ain Shams, a suburb of Cairo, they saw the dome of a Coptic church pierced by bombs dropped by diving planes. In the Abu Zabbal district, British and French aircraft not only bombed an Egyptian radio relay station but also bombed a nearby prison.

An Egyptian official spokesman said that the exact casualty figures are not yet known, but in the prison bakery alone, all seventy or more employed workers were killed. Many prisoners working in the workshops were also killed and wounded.

Due to the danger, foreign journalists were unable to visit Cairo's Mazza Airport and the nearby residential areas, because shortly before their arrival, several British and French aircraft carried out low-flying attacks, strafing peaceful residents on the streets with machine guns. At a first-aid station on Alraut Street, reporters saw people being brought in who had been injured in this barbaric air raid.

    联合国埃及代表团发言人说
    英法利用美国飞机侵略埃及
    外国记者目睹英法空中强盗屠杀开罗和平居民
    新华社6日讯　塔斯社纽约讯：联合国埃及代表团发言人昨天晚上对新闻记者说，根据他刚刚收到的来自开罗的消息，在埃及领空击落了一架美国制造的“恶猫式”歼击机。埃及发言人说，这架飞机上有北大西洋公约组织的标志，它属于“美国根据大西洋公约供给英国和法国的那种类型的飞机”。
    埃及发言人又说，如果供给北大西洋公约组织的美国军备被用来屠杀埃及、阿尔及利亚或其他什么地方的和平居民，那末埃及政府就要最严正地要求考虑这一问题。
    新华社6日讯　塔斯社开罗5日讯：驻在开罗的外国记者在11月3日访问了几处在前一天受到英国和法国飞机空袭的地方。
    在开罗近郊的艾因夏姆，他们看到一座哥普特教派的教堂的圆形屋顶被俯冲的飞机炸穿了。在阿布札巴勒区，英国和法国的飞机不仅轰炸了埃及的一座无线电转播电台，而且还轰炸了附近的一所监狱。
    埃及官方发言人说，准确的伤亡数字现在还不知道，但是仅仅在监狱的面包房一个地方，所有七十多个雇用的工人都被炸死了。在工场内工作的犯人也被炸死和炸伤了许多。
    由于有危险，外国记者们不能到开罗的马扎机场和附近的居民区去访问，因为就在他们到达前不久，好几架英国和法国飞机进行了低飞袭击，用机关枪扫射街上的和平居民。记者们在阿尔劳特街上的一个急救站可以看到抬送来的在这次野蛮的空袭中受伤的人。
