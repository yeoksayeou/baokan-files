Xinhua News Agency, Hailar, November 26th (By Xinhua News Agency reporter Mao Chunli): The severe winter has descended upon the Greater Khingan Mountains. Here, the snow is a foot deep, rivers are frozen, and tens of thousands of forest industry workers have begun their intense winter operations in this cold season. The valleys covered with dense forests now echo with the sound of giant trees being felled all day long. Thousands of horses and hundreds of tractors are dragging thick timber through the snow-covered forests, and ten-ton trucks are transporting timber to storage yards day and night. Drivers of cars, tractors, and forest trains have begun working in three shifts. In the dispatch room of the Inner Mongolia Forestry Industry Bureau, people are on duty day and night listening to production progress reports from the field and issuing new dispatch orders.

Winter freezes the muddy forest areas solid, allowing people to transport timber smoothly. Therefore, winter has always been called the "golden season" by the forestry industry workers of the Greater Khingan Mountains. With the rapid growth of basic construction tasks this year, the production tasks of Inner Mongolia's forestry industry have increased by more than 30%. In order to strive to complete and overfulfill production tasks, forestry industry workers have actively launched socialist competitions since the beginning of winter. Since mid-November, the average daily amount of timber felled and transported to the state has reached more than 3,000 cubic meters, more than twice as much as in October.

In the Markang Forest Area
Xinhua News Agency, Shuajingsi, November 26th: The largest new forest area in Sichuan Province—the Markang Forest Area in the Aba Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture—all logging sites have been put into production.

The Markang Forest Area has eight logging sites with more than 4,500 workers. The production task for this winter is 100,000 cubic meters. Approximately 10,000 cubic meters of timber have already been pushed down from the mountains and concentrated on the banks of the Suomo River, upstream of the Dadu River.

Currently, while producing, each logging site is also rushing to build workers' shacks, timber chutes, sluices and sled roads, blasting rocks in the river, building transportation roads leading to various work sites, and installing power lines and telephones connecting the logging sites.

    森林工人生产忙
    寒冷的大兴安岭
    新华社海拉尔26日电　新华社记者毛纯礼报道：严冬降临到大兴安岭。这里，积雪盈尺，河川已经封冻，几万名森林工业工人在这个寒冷的季节里开始了紧张的冬季作业。复着密林的山谷，现在整日回响着巨树被伐倒的声音；上千匹的牛马和成百台的拖拉机拖着粗大的木材在大雪盖地的森林里奔驰，载重十吨的大卡车日夜不停地把木材运到贮木场。汽车、拖拉机和森林火车的司机们开始分成三班轮流工作。在内蒙古森林工业管理局的调度室内，日夜有人在听取来自现场的生产进度报告和发布新的调度命令。
    冬季把泥泞的森林地带冻得坚实了，人们能够顺利地采运木材。所以冬季一向被大兴安岭森林工业职工称为“黄金季节”。在今年基本建设任务迅速增长的情况下，内蒙古森林工业的生产任务增加了30％以上。为了争取完成和超额完成生产任务，森林工业职工入冬以来积极展开了社会主义竞赛。11月中旬以来，平均每日由伐木场采运下来交给国家的木材已经达三千多立方公尺，比10月份增加了两倍多。
    在马尔康林区
    新华社刷经寺26日电　四川省最大的一个新林区——阿坝藏族自治州马尔康林区，各个伐木场都已经投入生产。
    马尔康林区共有八个伐木场，职工四千五百多人。今年冬季的生产任务是十万立方公尺。约有一万立方公尺木材已经从山上推下，集中在大渡河上游的梭磨河边。
    现在，各伐木场正在一边生产，一边赶修职工住的工棚、运材滑道、水闸和爬犁道，炸掉河中的岩石，修筑通往各个工地的运输便道，安装连系各个伐木场的电线电话。
