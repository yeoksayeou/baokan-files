Unified Management of Sanatoriums

Currently, there are many sanatoriums in various regions, and the dispersed and wasteful nature of the work is extremely serious, which should be quickly overcome.

Since the nationwide liberation, more than 50,000 beds have been built in sanatoriums. These sanatoriums, in coordination with other medical and preventive units, have helped a large number of patients recover their health and played a positive role. This is an undeniable fact. However, these many sanatoriums lack comprehensive planning and unified management. Various departments have been establishing and managing them according to their own wishes, and beds cannot be adjusted among them. Their development has been somewhat blind.

Many cadre sanatoriums, in the early days of liberation when there were few beds, stipulated stricter level restrictions for cadres who needed to be admitted for recuperation. However, when the number of beds gradually increased, this restriction was not cancelled or relaxed. Many leading organs believe that if the level restrictions are relaxed, there will not be enough beds, and the work will be passive. They would rather leave the beds empty than let people in. Some units regard sanatoriums as guesthouses or old people's homes, and some cadres who do not need recuperation are also sent to sanatoriums for "rest." This is an extremely unreasonable phenomenon.

Now, these wasteful phenomena must be exposed, and we cannot let it continue to develop.

According to surveys, the average utilization rate of sanatorium beds nationwide is only over 70%. That is to say, about 10,000 beds nationwide are idle all year round. The Conghua Sanatorium in Guangdong has 150 beds, and the average utilization rate is only 20-30%. On the other hand, many patients who request hospitalization do not have the opportunity. In some places, sanatoriums cannot be adjusted among themselves. In Hangzhou, the utilization rate of the Qianjiang Workers' Sanatorium exceeds 100%, while other sanatoriums have 70-80% empty beds.

At the same time, the turnover rate of beds in many sanatoriums is also too low. Except for the trade union sanatoriums, which have an average turnover of four to five times per year, other sanatoriums cannot even achieve an average turnover of twice per bed per year. That is to say, one bed can only accommodate one or more people for recuperation in a year. There are also a small number of patients who have been hospitalized for as long as seven or eight years. The turnover rate of these beds is even lower.

In the past few years, nearly 20,000 beds have been built in sanatoriums in Qingdao, Beidaihe, Taihu, Hangzhou, Lushan, and other places, forming sanatorium areas. However, the equipment utilization rate of these sanatoriums is very low. There is a lack of connection and cooperation between the various sanatoriums built in the same area, and everything is separate. For example, Qingdao has twelve sanatoriums with more than 2,200 beds, and a total of five X-ray machines and more than 100 physiotherapy equipment have been purchased. Most sanatoriums have washing machines. In the five sanatoriums near Zhanshan Temple alone, four clubs have been built, which can accommodate about 1,500 people at the same time, but the average utilization rate is less than 50%.

To eliminate these wasteful phenomena in many sanatoriums, it is necessary to unify the management of sanatoriums. That is to say, at present, there should be a comprehensive plan for the work of sanatoriums. The construction of new sanatoriums should be balanced by the Ministry of Health and approved by the State Construction Commission. The funds of each sanatorium are still controlled separately by the relevant departments, while all other work of the sanatoriums, including management, bed adjustment, equipment utilization, medical technology, and related rules and regulations, shall be uniformly managed and arranged by the local people's committees. By doing so, waste of manpower and material resources can be reduced, and beds can be fully utilized. After the sanatoriums are unifiedly managed by the local authorities, it will be of great benefit to the medical and sanatorium work in various places.

In order to help provinces and cities carry out unified management, relevant central units need to jointly study specific measures. Under the leadership of the provincial and municipal people's committees, it is best to organize a sanatorium management committee to jointly discuss and handle certain major issues.

Sanatorium work is a part of health work. Sanatoriums should cooperate with other medical institutions to jointly do a good job in people's health care. The Ministry of Health should implement unified business leadership over sanatoriums nationwide. In the past few years, the Ministry of Health has not done enough in this regard. In order to quickly change this situation, the Ministry of Health should conduct serious investigations and research, propose specific plans to improve the work of sanatoriums, formulate various relevant regulations, systems, and work indicators, pay attention to the training and allocation of cadres, strengthen the connection between sanatoriums and hospitals, and strengthen the research and promotion of effective medical methods for chronic diseases in traditional Chinese medicine.

At present, in the work of unified management of sanatoriums, all relevant parties must implement the principle of thrift, resolutely oppose extravagance and waste, and overcome any ideas and practices that emphasize their own specialness. Only in this way can the work of unified management of sanatoriums be done well.

### 统一管理疗养院

    统一管理疗养院
    现时各地疗养院很多，工作中的分散和浪费现象极为严重，应该迅速加以克服。
    全国解放以来，已经修建的疗养院共有五万多个床位。这些疗养院配合其他医疗预防单位，曾经帮助大批的病人恢复了健康，起了良好的作用，这是不可否认的事实；可是这许多疗养院缺乏全面的计划和统一的管理，各个部门都按照自己的意愿，自行建立和管理，彼此之间在床位上不能互相调剂，它们的发展带有相当程度的盲目性。
    许多干部疗养院，在解放初期床位不多的情况下，对需要入院疗养的干部，规定了较严的级别限制。但是，当床位逐渐增加之后，这个限制还没有取消或放宽。不少领导机关认为，如果放宽了级别限制，床位就不够了，工作会被动，宁愿空着床位，不让人进来。有些单位把疗养院当成了招待所或养老院，一些不需要疗养的干部，也被送到疗养院“休养”。这是极不合理的现象。
    现在要把这些浪费现象揭露出来，不能再让它继续发展下去了。
    据调查，全国疗养院床位的平均使用率仅达百分之七十多。也就是说，全国有一万张左右的床位常年空闲。广东从化疗养院一百五十个床位，平均使用率仅在百分之二、三十。而另一方面，有许多要求住院的病人，却没有住院的机会。有的地方疗养院不能互相调剂。在杭州，钱江工人疗养院的使用率超过了百分之百，而在其他几个疗养院里却有百分之七、八十的空床。
    同时，许多疗养院病床的周转率也太低。除了工会疗养院每年平均周转四至五次以外，其他的疗养院平均每床每年还不能周转两次。也就是说，一个床位一年内才能供一个多人疗养。还有少数的病人，住院的时间竟达七、八年之久。这些病床的周转率就更低。
    过去几年，青岛、北戴河、太湖、杭州、庐山等地，修建了将近两万个床位的疗养院，形成了疗养区。但是这些疗养院的设备利用率都很低。建筑在同一地区内的各个疗养院之间，缺乏联系与合作，什么都是各有一套。如青岛有十二个疗养院，两千二百多个床位，一共购买了五架爱克斯光机，一百多件理疗器械，大多数的疗养院都有洗衣机。仅在湛山寺附近的五个疗养院里，就盖了四个俱乐部，同时可容纳一千五百人左右，而平均使用率还不到50％。
    要消除这许多疗养院的浪费现象，就必须统一管理疗养院。这就是说，目前对于疗养院的工作要有全面计划，新建疗养院，应由卫生部平衡，国家建设委员会批准。各疗养院的经费仍由各有关部门分别掌握，而疗养院的其他一切工作，包括管理、床位调剂、设备利用、医疗技术以及有关的规章制度等等，统一接受所在地人民委员会的统一管理和安排。这样做，就可减少人力物力上的浪费，就可把病床充分利用起来。疗养院由地方统一管起来之后，对各地的医疗和疗养工作会有很大好处。
    为了帮助省市进行统一管理，中央有关单位需要共同研究出具体办法。在省市人民委员会的领导下，最好组织疗养管理委员会，共同协商处理某些重大问题。
    疗养院工作是卫生工作的一部分。疗养院应该同其他的医疗机构互相配合，共同做好人民的保健事业。卫生部应当对全国疗养院实行统一的业务领导。过去几年来，卫生部在这方面做得不够。为了迅速改变这种情况，卫生部应该认真进行调查研究，提出具体改进疗养院工作的方案，拟定各项有关的章则、制度、工作指标，注意培养和调配干部，密切疗养院同医院的联系，加强祖国医学中对慢性病有效医疗方法的研究和推广。
    目前，在对疗养院进行统一管理的工作中，各有关方面必须贯彻节约的原则，坚决反对铺张浪费，克服任何强调自己特殊的想法和做法。只有这样，才能把统一管理疗养院的工作做好。
