Arriving in Yanbian, Eyes Opened
Kang Tuo

Three

I want to reiterate the fact that the Korean rural women rushed to shake hands with Kim Shi-ryong, which I mentioned earlier, to begin my description of another impression of Yanbian. This is an impression about women and culture. First of all, although everyone knows that all ethnic groups in our country possess amazing qualities of diligence, in Yanbian, you will be refreshed and strongly feel that Korean women are indeed extraordinary in their labor. A mother can carry several packages on her head and shoulders, and also carry and pull several children on the street or at the train station. Women bear all the housework, including carrying water for the whole family by jug. In rural areas, women can operate almost all the field work except for a few of the most arduous tasks, and there are often more women than men in the fields. Han Chinese rural women rarely dig toilets or build pig pens, but such things seem unremarkable in Yanbian. Moreover, Korean women generally have a fairly high level of culture. They are no different from men in this respect, as evidenced by their nationally renowned songs and dances. Furthermore, I also know that even Han Chinese rural women have not developed the habit of shaking hands with strangers like Korean rural women. This is not just a matter of habit, but may also have cultural reasons.

It may be a bit far-fetched to move from the habit of shaking hands to culture. Then, let me mention a Korean girl named Kim Ok-ja. Her name appeared on an oil painting in an amateur art exhibition in Changchun City. The main body of this painting is a large bull head with a strong working atmosphere. This is an award-winning work in that art exhibition, and this work has now been transported to Beijing. In front of the author's name of this painting, the words "farmer" are also marked. Farmers can paint so well? Can paint oil paintings? And still a woman! Absolutely true! I accidentally and fortunately met Kim Ok-ja in Tumen River Town. She is an agricultural cooperative member, a junior high school graduate not long ago. She had just received the oil painting bonus issued by Jilin Province from Yanji and was on her way home. She and a female classmate accompanied us, stepping on the silent and dazzling moonlight by the Tumen River, gazing at the North Korean Nanyang Town and the unyielding mountains of North Korea on the opposite bank, which were close at hand on our national border, walking back and forth. She and her classmate introduced us to the situation and friendship on the Sino-North Korean border here, and also danced and sang for us. Kim Ok-ja was able to perform many dances and songs she had seen and heard, including Mei Lanfang's dance and Indian songs learned from movies. Compared with her slender and quiet classmate, Kim Ok-ja is a plump, rugged, and intellectually compelling girl. I will never forget to thank her and her classmate for the lucky and rich night they gave me, which triggered thousands of thoughts.

And exciting men and women like Kim Ok-ja are tens of thousands in Yanbian's urban and rural areas. I met three of the people who won art awards at the same time as her. Other advanced labor intellectuals are everywhere. Almost every agricultural cooperative with about two hundred households has thirty or forty graduates from universities and secondary schools. Education is very popular. Every year, the average person in the entire autonomous prefecture buys two and a half publications. Sports are even more developed. Almost every village has one or another kind of team. The recently held 1956 Eight-County Football Championship included all five county teams in Yanbian. The women's team champion of this year's National Junior Volleyball Championship was also won by Yanbian...

I also want to hastily record another Korean girl. This is a nineteen-year-old tiger-raising girl in Yanji Park. Her name is Yin Shoude, and she is a junior high school graduate. Tall and black-red in appearance, with a brave and thoughtful temperament. Less than a year ago, local hunters hunted a litter of four famous Changbai white tiger cubs and sent them to the park. Yin Shoude volunteered to take on the task of feeding them. At that time, the tigers were only the size of cats. She fed them milk like taking care of children, and then slowly fed them meat. Soon, she reluctantly let two tigers go to Changchun; the current two, according to her, are a male and a female, both have Korean names she gave them, both are four feet long, and can drill circles, play wooden balls and push the mill in the iron fence. She wears a Russian-style, baggy, belted, peach-red satin top, which is both capable and eye-catching. As long as she slightly reveals a little figure in any corner outside the iron fence, the fierce and roaring tiger in the fence immediately becomes silent and motionless, staring at her corner. As soon as she reveals herself, the tiger immediately rushes towards her, extends its front paws from the fence to shake hands with her, and then kisses her hand with its mouth, licking the flowers or leaves pinched on her fingers, so affectionately as if it wants her to hug it. She also naturally and kindly patted and touched the tiger's head, mouth and body, and then ran back and forth around the iron fence; at this time, the tiger seemed afraid of losing its loved one, and also followed anxiously in the fence, and also ran back and forth through the circle set up on the wooden slat-woven half-fan partition blocking its way. The relationship between man and tiger is so harmonious and seamless, only after Yin Shoude entered the iron fence, the situation was slightly different. She held an iron rod and drove one tiger back to its residence, and when she released the other tiger, the one that was driven was always a little disobedient; so, while waving the iron rod, she scolded and took semi-compulsory actions. Of course, her tiger could only bow its head to her quickly.

There is a rumor in Yanji that Yin Shoude once approached her tiger, but because she did not wear a special red satin top, she was mistaken by the tiger and bitten her. It is also said that when she volunteered to accept the task of raising tigers, her lover disagreed with her actions and could not stop her, so she broke off her love relationship with her. These are all touching legends, and the latter saying is even more affectionate and meaningful. However, I cannot say the accuracy of these legends. I once stood among the crowded crowd, watched Yin Shoude and her tigers for a long time, and had the happiness of talking to her. But she talked very little. She only said that the cubs are very fun and easy to feed; when they grow up, she is "externally intimate and internally dignified" - she is especially intimate with tigers outside the iron fence, and somewhat imposing inside the fence; the milk that tigers eat has always been cooked, and now each one eats five catties of meat every day, and the meat has always been cut into thin slices - this can prevent the tiger's wildness. She also said that she learned this from books, but unfortunately such books are really hard to find. In addition, she also talked about the care and concern of the Party and the government for her and the tigers; she said:

"Every few days, leaders always come to see me and the tigers, and always ask me what difficulties I have..."

She smiled shyly, lowered her head, remained silent, and said nothing more.

This tiger-raising girl is so shy, just as she appears very easy-going in front of tigers. But isn't this precisely the outstanding manifestation of her courage, tenacity and wisdom, even more outstanding than her dazzling red clothes? Her true extraordinariness lies in her ordinary behavior.

Yanbian, Yanbian, amazing beauty, nurturing ordinary and amazing children. The endless mountains and rivers, the endless outstanding people... I am really "arrived in Yanbian, eyes opened", I really cannot control my feelings of gratitude, admiration and humble learning. (To be continued)

    到得延边两目花
    康濯
    三
    我想重复提到刚才说起过的朝鲜族的农村妇女赶着和金时龙握手这一事实，来开始记述我对延边的另一个印象。这是关于妇女和文化的印象。我首先要说的是，虽然谁都知道我国各族人民都有着惊人的勤劳的品质，但是，在延边，你却处处都会突然耳目一新地强烈感到，朝鲜族妇女在劳动上实在是极不平凡。一个母亲，在街道上或在火车站上，可以顶着、挎着几个包袱，还背着、拉着几个儿女。妇女担负着全部的家务，包括用罐子顶回全家用水的家务。在农村，田地里除了少数几种最繁重的活儿，其它的几乎全部都可以由妇女操作，庄稼地里往往也是妇女多过男人。汉族农妇挖厕所起猪圈的不多，这类事在延边却显得并不奇特。而朝鲜族妇女又还普遍有着相当高的文化，她们在这方面和男子决无差别，那闻名全国的歌声和舞蹈就是证明。并且，我还知道即使是汉族的农村妇女，也没有养成朝鲜族农妇那样同外人见面握手的习惯；而这绝不只是习惯方面的事，这里容或也有文化上的原因。
    从握手的习惯扯到文化，也许有些勉强。那末，让我提到一个名叫金玉子的朝鲜族姑娘。她这个名字出现在长春市一个业余画展中的一幅油画上。这幅画的主体是一个很大的、劳动气息强烈的牛头。这是那个画展中的一幅得奖作品，这个作品现在运到了北京。而在这幅画的作者名字的前边，还标出了“农民”两个字。农民能够画得这么好？能够画油画？而且还是个妇女呢！千真万确！我曾在图们江镇上，无意中幸运地遇见了金玉子。她是一个农业社员，一个不久以前的初中毕业生。她刚从延吉领取了吉林省发给的油画奖金，当时正在回家的路上。她和她的一个女同学，陪伴着我们，踏着图们江边寂静无声和明光耀眼的月色，在我们的国境线上，凝望着近在眼前的对岸的朝鲜南阳镇和朝鲜的不屈的山川，来回散步。她和她的同学给我们介绍这里中朝国界上的情景和友谊，而且还为我们跳舞唱歌。金玉子能够表演出她见过和听过的许多舞蹈和歌曲，包括从电影上学来的梅兰芳的舞蹈和印度的歌曲。和她那个苗条的、沉静的同学相比，金玉子是一个胖胖的、粗犷的、智慧逼人的姑娘。我将永不忘怀地感谢她和她的同学给与我的那个幸运的、丰富的、引发我万缕思潮的夜晚。
    而令人激动的像金玉子这样的男女，在延边城乡是成万成千。和她同时得到画奖的，我就碰到三个。其它先进的劳动知识分子，到处都是，差不多每个二百来户的农业社里，都有三几十个大中学毕业生。教育十分普及。每年全自治州销售的出版物，平均每个人要买走两本半。体育运动更是发达，几乎每个村子都有这种或那种球队。最近举行的1956年八县足球锦标赛，就包括了延边全部的五个县队。今年全国少年排球锦标赛女子队冠军，也是被延边夺得……。
    我还要匆忙地记下另一个朝鲜族姑娘，这是延吉公园里一个十九岁的养虎的姑娘。她叫尹寿德，初中毕业。硕长的黑红的外形，勇敢的沉思的气质。不到一年以前，当地猎人猎获了一窝四只有名的长白乳虎，送到公园，尹寿德就自愿接受了喂养的任务。当时老虎只有猫那么大，她像带小孩一样给喂牛奶，后来并慢慢地喂肉。不久，她恋恋不舍地让两只老虎去了长春；现在的两只，照她说是一男一女，都有她给取的朝鲜语的名字，都是四尺来长，都会在铁栏内钻圈、玩木球和推磨。她穿着一件俄罗斯式的肥大的系腰带的桃红色缎料上衣，又精干、又显眼。只要她在铁栏外的任何角落微微露出一点儿身影，栏内凶猛吼跳的老虎立时就悄声没息，一动不动地凝望着她那个角落。等她刚刚露出身子，老虎马上就朝她扑去，从栏缝里伸出前爪同她握手，然后就拿嘴吻她的手，舐她手指头上掐着的花朵或树叶，亲昵得好像要她抱一抱。她也就自然而亲切地在虎头、虎嘴和虎身上拍拍摸摸，接着又绕着铁栏来回跑动；这时候，老虎好像生怕失掉了亲人，也在栏内急喘喘地跟着跑动，并且来回钻过挡在它的路上的、木条编成的半扇隔扇上安设的圆圈。这人虎之间是如此地融洽无间，只是在尹寿德进入铁栏以后，情景才略有不同。她拿着一根铁棍，把一只虎赶回住处，放另一只虎出来的时候，被赶的一只总不大听话；于是，她一边挥动铁棍，一边呵斥，采取着半强迫的行动。当然，她的虎也就只能很快地向她低头。
    延吉有人传说，尹寿德有一次接近她的虎的时候，因为没有穿上特殊的红缎上衣，竟被老虎错认，咬了她一口。又说，当她自愿接受养虎任务的时候，她的爱人不同意她的行动而又阻挡不住，竟跟她断绝了恋爱关系。这都是动人的传说，后一说更是人情浓重而意味深长。不过，我说不出这些传说的准确程度。我曾夹在轰动的人群中，久久地看过尹寿德和她的老虎，并且获得和她谈话的幸福。但她谈得很少。她只说，小虎很好玩，也很好喂；长大了，她是“外亲内威”——在铁栏外待虎特别亲，栏内多少施点威势；虎吃的牛奶一直是煮熟的，如今每一只每天吃五斤肉，肉也一直是切成细片——这可以不至引起虎的野性。又说，她这都是从书上学来的，可惜这方面的书实在不好找。此外，她还谈到党和政府对她、对虎的关心和照顾；她说：
    “每隔几天，总有首长来看我和虎，还总问我有什么困难……”
    她不好意思地笑笑，低头，沉默，再也不说什么。
    这个养虎的姑娘，竟是这样地靦觍，这正如她在老虎面前那样显得十分平易。但是，这难道不正是她勇敢、顽强和智慧的突出的表现，比她那耀眼的红衣还要突出的表现么？她的真正的不平凡，正是她的平凡的举止。
    延边，延边，惊人的美丽，养育着平凡而又惊人的儿女。那看不尽的山川风物，那说不完的优秀人物……我真是“到得延边两目花”，我真是制不住自己感激、敬仰和虚心学习的情绪。（续完）
