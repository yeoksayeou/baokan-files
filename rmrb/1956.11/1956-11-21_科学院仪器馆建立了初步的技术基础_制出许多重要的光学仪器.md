Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 18th -- Wang Daheng, Acting Director of the Chinese Academy of Sciences Instrument Hall, said at the inaugural meeting of the Instrument Hall Academic Committee: After several years of work, the Instrument Hall has mastered some of the internationally available advanced technologies in instrument manufacturing, especially in optical instrument manufacturing, and has established a preliminary technical foundation.

Wang Daheng said: In the research and manufacturing of optical instruments, regarding microscope technology, we have mastered the design and manufacturing technology of high-power microscopes and have trial-produced binocular microscopes, reading traveling microscopes, etc. In measuring instruments, we have initially trial-produced third-order measuring optical reading theodolites, engineering rapid surveying large plane table instruments, etc. In image projection and photographic systems, we have successfully designed and trial-produced 16mm projector lenses, photographic lenses, aerial surveying and mapping projection lenses, etc. In addition, we have also improved and trial-produced magnetic scales and biogas interferometers, manufactured precision instruments such as optical systems for refracting telescopes, and other material testing machines. These successfully researched and trial-produced instruments have all been put into production in relevant production units.

Wang Daheng said: Another achievement of the Instrument Hall is that it has basically mastered the complete set of production technology for optical glass. The Instrument Hall has established equipment for optical glass melting, forming processing, crucible manufacturing, precision annealing, etc.; and has successfully trial-melted twenty types of optical glass.

The inaugural meeting of the Instrument Hall Academic Committee was held in Changchun from the 12th to the 17th. At the meeting, researchers from the Instrument Hall read ten papers related to the above-mentioned research work. Soviet experts invited to participate in the conference also gave two reports on instrument science work. The conference also discussed the Instrument Hall's development direction, tasks, and the outline of the institute's 1957 research plan.

    科学院仪器馆建立了初步的技术基础
    制出许多重要的光学仪器
    新华社长春18日电　中国科学院仪器馆代理馆长王大珩在仪器馆学术委员会成立大会上说：仪器馆经过几年来的工作，已经在仪器制造特别是光学仪器制造上掌握了一些国际上已有的先进技术，并且建立了初步的技术基础。
    王大珩说：仪器馆在研究制造光学仪器方面，关于显微镜的技术已经掌握了高倍显微镜的设计和制造技术，试制了双目显微镜、读数游动显微镜等。测量仪器中已初步试制出三级测量用光学读数经纬仪、工程用速测大平板仪等。映影和摄影系统中已设计试制成功——6毫米放映机用映影镜头摄影镜头、航空测量制图用的映影镜头等。此外，还改进试制了磁力秤和沼气干涉仪，制造了折光望远镜光学等系统的精密仪器，以及其他材料试验机等。这些研究试制成功的仪器，都已经在有关生产单位进行生产。
    王大珩说：仪器馆的又一项成就，是已经基本上掌握了光学玻璃成套的生产技术。仪器馆已建立了光学玻璃熔制、成型处理、坩埚制造、精密退火等设备；试熔成功二十种光学玻璃。
    仪器馆学术委员会成立大会是12日到17日在长春举行的。在大会上，仪器馆研究人员宣读了有关上述各项研究工作的十篇论文。应邀参加大会的苏联专家也作了两篇有关仪器科学工作的报告。大会还讨论了仪器馆的发展方针任务和这个馆的1957年研究计划纲要。
