Also Discussing Vulgar Sociology
　　Yao Wenyuan
    A comrade working in a newspaper office told me this story: He submitted a poem, which he thought was quite good, to the editor-in-chief. The editor-in-chief thought it was "not politically clear enough," so he picked up his pen and revised it, turning it into a political essay written in separate lines. Some lines of the poem were dozens of words long, while others were only a few words long, and all the rhyme was lost... This comrade said with a wry smile: "He is the editor-in-chief and has the final say. There's no point in talking to him about literary characteristics, he won't listen..." This remark evoked the sigh of another comrade who had worked in a newspaper office, who said: "We have the same situation there!"
    In some articles, people indignantly attribute all the oversimplified views of literature and art among the masses and the causes of formulaic and conceptualized creation to vulgar sociology in theoretical criticism, as if all the mistakes are the fault of the critics. I think this view is not necessarily comprehensive. If we think that vulgar sociology will disappear from society and literary creation if theorists remain silent, that is also a very naive idea. The emergence of vulgar sociology has complex social reasons.
    In the minds of many people who do not engage in literary work, the views of vulgar sociology are also very deep, sometimes even deeper than those of literary workers. The August issue of "Guangdong Literature and Art" published such a story: In the work of unified purchase and marketing, a district committee comrade suddenly thought that "dragon boat" could be used to promote the unified purchase and marketing policy, so he found a writer and ordered him to write three "dragon boat" pieces within a limited time. When the writer expressed difficulties, the comrade sternly questioned: "I ask you... if you don't promote the Party's policies and cooperate with the Party's central movement, what else do you promote? Do you still want to write those... yellow things?..."
    Either "cooperate with the central movement" and "promote the Party's policies," or "yellow things," one of the two must be chosen. This is how some people view literature and art.
    In recent years, our country and people have engaged in complex and acute class struggles and experienced the storms of socialist revolution and huge ideological struggles. We have vigorously criticized bourgeois ideology and various tendencies that ignore politics. This is necessary. Without this work, there would be no situation of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" today. But we must also see that, in addition to the real subjective shortcomings, certain negative factors have also emerged in the fierce struggle. Some people often abandoned the special role of art that is different from other propaganda tools, or simply did not understand this special role. They do not understand that "a work of art that lacks artistry, no matter how progressive it is politically, is powerless" (Chairman Mao). When they demand literary and artistic works with one-sided views, they create a heavy pressure on literary and artistic creation, and many writers shrink back and have many concerns. Some writers themselves also intentionally or unintentionally lower the special requirements and special laws of artistic creation, only seeking to "cooperate" in general, and consider that good enough.
    The political standard is always the first, and this cannot be shaken. But not understanding the characteristics of art, applying general laws rigidly, and mechanically equating the role of literature and art with the role of general propaganda is dogmatism. This, like attempting to separate art from politics, must be resolutely opposed. Writers themselves must grasp this point, adhere to this point, and do more explanatory work for the masses in society. If we think that we can solve all the problems of vulgar sociology by simply scolding the critics without doing this work, then we are oversimplifying the complex problem.

    也谈庸俗社会学
    姚文元
    有一个在报社工作的同志告诉我这样一件事情：他把一首还算好的诗发给总编辑。总编辑以为“政治上不够明确”，提笔删改，把它改成一篇分行写的政治论文，有的诗行长到几十个字，有的只有几个字，韵律全部消失了……这位同志苦笑说：“他是总编辑，有最后决定权，同他谈什么文艺特征，他是听不进去的……”这话引起了另一位在报社工作过的同志的感慨，他说：“这种情况我们那里也有！”
    某些文章中，极其愤慨地把群众中对文艺简单化的观点和创作上公式化概念化的原因全部归罪于理论批评工作中的庸俗社会学，仿佛一切错误都是批评家的过错，我以为这种看法未必是全面的。如果以为理论家闭口不言，社会上和文艺创作中庸俗社会学就会消失，那也是非常天真的想法。庸俗社会学的产生，还有着复杂的社会原因。
    在许多不做文艺工作的人的头脑中，庸俗社会学的观点也很深，有时比文艺工作者还要深。“广东文艺”八月号就登载着这么一件事，在统购统销工作中，一个区委同志忽然想起可以用“龙舟”来宣传统购统销政策，于是找了一位作者限期写出三篇“龙舟”，当作者表示有困难时，这位同志声色俱厉地责问道：“我问你，……不宣传党的政策，不配合党的中心运动，还宣传什么？你还想写那些……黄色的东西吗？……”
    或者是“配合中心运动”“宣传党的政策”，或者就是“黄色的东西”，二者必居其一。这就是有一部分人对文学艺术的看法。
    几年来，我们国家和人民投入了复杂尖锐的阶级斗争，经历了社会主义革命和巨大的思想斗争的暴风雨。大力批判了资产阶级思想和各种忽视政治的倾向。这是必要的，没有这些工作，就不会有今天百家争鸣、百花齐放的局面。但也不能不看到，除了确实存在的主观上的缺点外，在剧烈的斗争中也产生了某些消极因素，有的人往往抛开了艺术不同于其他宣传工具的特殊作用，或者根本不了解这种特殊作用。不了解“缺乏艺术性的艺术品，无论政治上怎样进步，也是没有力量的。”（毛主席）。当他们用片面的观点要求文艺作品时，就对文艺创作形成一种沉重的压力，不少作家缩手缩脚，顾虑很多。某些作家自己也有意无意地降低了艺术创造的特殊要求和特殊规律，但求大体上能“配合”过去，就算好了。
    政治标准永远是第一这一点不能动摇。但不懂得艺术特点用一般的规律去套，把文学艺术的作用同一般宣传的作用机械地划上等号，这就是教条主义。这同企图把艺术同政治分开一样是要坚决反对的。作家自己要掌握住这一点，坚持这一点，对社会上的群众还要做更多的解释工作。如果以为不做这些工作，单把批评家大骂一顿就可以解决全部的庸俗社会学问题，那未免把复杂的问题看得太简单了。
