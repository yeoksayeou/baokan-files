    Opinions on Strengthening the Supervision of Government Organs by People's Congresses

    Editor:

    Comrade Liu Shaoqi mentioned in the political report to the "Eighth National Congress": "In order to wage an effective struggle against bureaucracy, ... it is necessary to strengthen the supervision of central-level government organs by the National People's Congress and its Standing Committee, and the supervision of local government organs at all levels by local People's Congresses at all levels...." This is a major task put forward to the National People's Congress and local People's Congresses at all levels. Now I would like to offer some opinions on how the county People's Congress can accomplish this task.

    One of the prerequisites for the People's Congress to supervise government organs is to hold meetings on schedule, listen to government work reports, reflect the opinions of the masses, and criticize shortcomings and errors in the work. According to the "Organic Law of the Local People's Congresses and Local People's Committees at All Levels of the People's Republic of China," the meetings of the People's Congresses of provinces, municipalities directly under the Central Government, counties, cities, and municipal districts shall be held twice a year. However, judging from the situation in Fengdu County, Sichuan Province, the provisions of the organic law have not been seriously implemented. For example, in 1954, the county People's Congress held two meetings, in 1955, it held one, and this year, as of September, it has not held one. I heard that this is also the case in many counties and cities in our province. Since the meetings are not held as scheduled, and the county People's Committee does not report its work to the congress as required, the representatives do not fully understand the work of the government (of course, they can also learn something from sources other than work reports). How can the supervisory role of the People's Congress over government organs be brought into play?

    Some people say: Although the county People's Congress meetings are not held on time, the Party and government leading organs often hold enlarged cadre meetings; many county People's Representatives are cadres, which is equivalent to convening a People's Congress meeting. However, I think: (1) Enlarged cadre meetings cannot replace People's Congress meetings, and there is no legal basis for this; (2) Among the representatives to the county People's Congress, some are not cadres; (3) The issues discussed at enlarged cadre meetings are only the central tasks at the time, and the scope is not as broad as the issues discussed at People's Congress meetings.

    In order for the People's Congress to play a supervisory role over government organs, representatives should be given ample opportunity to speak during the meetings. Fengdu County has not done well in this regard either. The three meetings held by the county People's Congress in the past lasted for a maximum of three days and a minimum of two days. In addition to the opening and closing ceremonies, political reports or work reports took up one day or more, and the remaining time was spent in group discussions of the reports and passing proposals. There was very little speech and discussion at the general assembly (there was an item for representatives to speak at the opening and closing of the congress, but only a few people spoke). In this way, the People's Representatives could not fully express their opinions, and the different opinions of the representatives in each group could not be fully discussed. As for the third meeting, it was entirely for the election of members of the county People's Committee and the president of the People's Court. Apart from announcing the election methods, the only other item was the election itself, with no other agenda.

    To strengthen the supervisory role of the county People's Congress over the county's government organs, I think a method should be formulated to strengthen the connection between the representatives and the government and the voters. Originally, the county People's Committee is both a government organ and a permanent body of the county People's Congress, and it should maintain regular and close contact with the representatives. However, in fact, due to the large number of representatives, their scattered residences, and the heavy workload of the county People's Committee, the two sides have almost no contact except during the meetings. The representatives usually cannot understand the work of the government, and it is difficult to talk about supervision. And sometimes, when representatives put forward a suggestion or reflect an opinion of the masses, they often do not receive a reply.

    Now, the Chongqing Municipal People's Committee has formulated a provisional method to strengthen the connection between the government and the representatives, and between the representatives and the voters. Therefore, I suggest that the Central People's Government use the Chongqing Municipal Provisional Method as a reference to formulate a universally applicable method for all counties and cities in the country to strengthen this connection, and issue it to all county and city People's Committees for conscientious implementation.　Qin Shangheng

### 加强人民代表大会对政府机关的监督的意见

    加强人民代表大会对政府机关的监督的意见
    编辑同志：
    刘少奇同志在“八大”的政治报告中曾经讲到：“为了同官僚主义作有效的斗争，……必须加强全国人民代表大会和它的常务委员会对中央一级政府机关的监督和地方各级人民代表大会对地方各级政府机关的监督……。”这是对全国人民代表大会和地方各级人民代表大会提出的一项重大任务。现在我就县人民代表大会如何完成这项任务提出一点意见。
    人民代表大会对政府机关进行监督的前提条件之一，是要按期举行会议，听取政府工作报告，反映群众的意见，对工作中的缺点和错误提出批评。按照中华人民共和国地方各级人民代表大会和地方各级人民委员会组织法规定，省、直辖市、县、市、市辖区的人民代表大会会议每年举行两次。但是，根据四川省酆都县的情况来看，组织法的规定并没有被认真执行，譬如，1954年，县人民代表大会举行过两次会议，1955年举行过一次，而今年到9月份还没有举行过一次。听说我省许多县市也是如此。会议既不按照规定举行，县人民委员会也不按照规定向大会报告工作，因此代表对政府的工作不完全了解（当然从工作报告以外也可以知道一些）。这样怎能发挥人民代表大会对政府机关的监督作用呢？
    有人说：县人民代表大会会议虽然没有按时召开，可是党政领导机关常常召开扩大干部会议；许多县人民代表都是干部，也就等于召开了人民代表大会会议。不过我想：（一）扩大干部会议并不能代替人民代表大会会议，在法律上也没有根据；（二）县人民代表大会的代表中，有若干人并不是干部；（三）扩大干部会议讨论的问题，只是当时的中心工作，范围不如人民代表大会会议讨论的范围广泛。
    为了使人民代表大会发挥对政府机关的监督作用，在会议期间，应该给代表充分发言的机会。酆都县在这方面也做得不好。县人民代表大会过去举行的三次会议，多则三天，少则二日，除了开幕、闭幕仪式以外，政治报告或工作报告要占一天或一天多的时间，其余的时间是小组对报告进行讨论和通过提案，大会发言和讨论很少（大会开幕闭幕时有代表讲话一项，但只有几人发言）。这样人民代表既不能充分发表意见，各组代表的不同意见也不能展开讨论。至于第三次会议，完全是选举县人民委员会的成员和人民法院的院长，除了公布选举办法以外，就是进行选举，没有其他议程。
    加强县人民代表大会对县的政府机关的监督作用，我想应该制定一种办法来加强人民代表同政府、选民的联系。本来，县人民委员会既是政府机关，又是县人民代表大会的常设机构，应该同代表们取得经常的密切联系。可是事实上，由于代表人数众多、居地分散，县人民委员会工作繁重，除会议期间以外，双方几乎没有甚么联系。代表平时不能了解政府的工作，当然也难谈到监督。而有时代表提出一点建议或反映群众的一点意见，也往往得不到答复。
    现在，重庆市人民委员会制定了一项暂行办法，来加强政府同代表、代表同选民的联系，因此我建议中央人民政府以重庆市的暂行办法为参考，制定全国各县、市可通用的办法来加强这种联系，颁发各县、市人民委员会切实执行。　秦上恒
