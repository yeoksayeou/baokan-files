    The Fisherman's Daughter is Singing
    Huang Shan
    The sun has set,
    The colorful clouds in the sky have disappeared,
    The stars have just begun to twinkle with white light,
    The fishing village is noisy at night.
    The lights in the fishermen's club are bright,
    The young men are playing accompaniment,
    The girls are singing,
    The children are busily scurrying through the crowd.
    The girls sing to their hearts' content,
    The children imitate naively,
    The old people sit on the side praising:
    "The girls' voices are so crisp and bright."
      1956, 4, at Zhoushan Dongsheng Fishery Cooperative

    渔家姑娘在歌唱
    荒山
    太阳落了，
    天空的彩霞已经消失，
    星星刚闪烁起白光，
    渔村里的夜闹嚷嚷。
    渔民俱乐部里的灯火明亮，
    小伙子们正在伴奏，
    姑娘们正在歌唱，
    孩子们在人群里钻来钻去忙。
    姑娘们尽情地唱，
    小孩子们天真地模仿，
    老年人坐在一边夸奖：
    “姑娘们的嗓子真脆亮。”
      1956，4，于舟山东升渔业社
