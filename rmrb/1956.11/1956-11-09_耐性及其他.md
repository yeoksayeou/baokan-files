    Patience and Others
    Wei Jinzhi
    Someone was about to take office as an official. His friend saw him off and told him, "When serving the country, you must be patient in all things!" He repeatedly said, "Yes! Yes! Yes!" After a while, he was instructed in the same way again, and he still repeatedly agreed.
    When he was instructed for the third time, he still said, "Okay! Okay!"
    When he was instructed for the fourth time, he finally couldn't bear it anymore and said angrily, "Do you think I'm a fool? Just two words, why do you keep saying them over and over again!"
    His friend sighed and said, "It seems that it is not easy to achieve patience. Look, you are already impatient after I have only said it three or four times!"
    It's Just Missing the Lees
    Grandma Wang ran a winery, making a living by selling wine. A Taoist priest often drank wine without paying, and Grandma Wang didn't argue with him. One day, the Taoist priest said to Grandma Wang, "I often drink your wine for free without paying. To repay you, I will dig a well for you!" After digging the well, the Taoist priest left.
    The spring water in the well was much purer than the taste of wine. Grandma Wang stopped brewing wine and only sold the well water as wine to people. After three years, she earned a lot of money.
    One day, the Taoist priest suddenly came again and asked Grandma Wang, "Is the wine good?"
    Grandma Wang said, "It's good, but it's just missing the lees, so I can't raise pigs!"
    The Taoist priest smiled and wrote a poem on the wall: "Heaven is not the highest, the human heart is the highest! Selling well water as wine, and still complaining about no lees for the pigs."
    After the Taoist priest wrote the poem, he left, and the well never produced wine again.
    The Weather is Abnormal
    One cold night, a general was drinking wine in his camp. Large candles were lit on both sides, a stove was burning in front of him, and with the strength of the wine heating his body, beads of sweat appeared on his forehead. While wiping the sweat, the general sighed and said, "The weather is too abnormal. It should be cold, but it's still so hot!"
    A soldier was standing guard outside the camp, shivering in the cold wind. He heard the general's words and came in to kneel and report, "Where we little people stand, the weather is still normal. If the general doesn't believe it, he can try it!"
    The above three excerpts are from "Snow Wave Novels"
    A Broken Boat is Just a Government Boat
    Huli Zi returned to his hometown from the capital. The prime minister asked the head of his household to see him off and instructed him, "If you want to take a boat, you can choose one yourself from the government boats!" Huli Zi had already arrived at the riverbank, but the head of the household had not yet arrived. At this time, there were more than a thousand large and small boats moored on the shore; there were no signs to indicate which were government boats and which were private boats, so there was no way to choose.
    Later, the head of the household arrived, and Huli Zi asked him, "Which are the government boats? What are the signs?"
    The head of the household laughed and said, "Isn't this easy? Any boat with a torn awning, a broken oar, or holes in the sail is a government boat."
    Huli Zi looked up to the sky and sighed, "No wonder the people under the emperor's rule are also broken and tattered!" From "Yu Lizi"

    耐性及其他
    魏金枝
    有人正要上任去做官，他的朋友给他送行，嘱咐他说：“给国办事，凡事要有耐性！”他连连说：“是！是！是！”过了一回，又照样嘱咐他，他也仍是连连答应。
    第三次嘱咐他时，他还是说：“好！好！”
    到了第四次嘱咐他时，他到底忍不住了，便忿忿地说：“你是不是把我当了呆子？只是两个字，为什么再三再四的说个不休！”
    他的朋友就叹口气说：“可见做到耐性是不容易的。你看，我才说了三、四次你就不耐烦了！”
    只是没有糟
    王老奶奶开了一个酒作坊，以卖酒为业。有个道士，常常吃了酒不付钱，王老奶奶也不和他计较。有一天，道士对王老奶奶说：“常常白吃你家的酒，没有还钱，为了报答你，我给你掘一口井吧！”掘好井，道士就走了。
    井里的泉水，比酒的味道要醇厚得多。王老奶奶就不再酿酒，只把井水当酒卖给人。过了三年，赚了很多钱。
    有一天，道士忽然又来了，问王老奶奶：“酒好么？”
    王老奶奶说：“好是好，只是没有糟，不能养猪！”
    道士笑了笑，在墙上题了一首诗：“天高不算高，人心第一高！井水做酒卖，还说猪无糟。”
    道士题好诗，走了，从此井里也不再出酒了。
    天气不正
    一个寒夜里，将军在营幕内饮酒。两边点着大蜡烛，身前生着火炉子，再加酒力在身里发热，于是头上便冒出汗珠子。将军一边拭汗，一边叹气说：“天气太不正常了，应该寒天了，却还是这么热！”
    有个兵士在营幕外站岗，被冷风吹得格格地发抖。他听见了将军的话，便进来跪禀说：“小人们站的地方，天气倒是还正常的，大人不信，不妨去试一试看！”
    以上三则出自“雪涛小说”
    破船就是官船
    瓠里子从京城回到故乡去，相国叫家里的总管代为送行，而且嘱咐他说：“要坐船的话，尽可以在官船中自己去选择！”瓠里子已经来到江边，而那个总管却还没有来。这时，停在岸边的大小船只，简直有一千多；哪只是官船，哪只是私船，既没有标志，所以也无从选起。
    后来总管来了，瓠里子就问他：“哪些是官船？有什么标志？”
    总管哈哈大笑说：“这不是很容易么？凡是篷破的，橹断的，帆上有洞洞的，就都是官船。”
    瓠里子仰天叹口气说：“难怪在皇帝管理下的百姓，也都是破破烂烂的！”　　出自“郁离子”
