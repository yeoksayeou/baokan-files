    Random Thoughts by a Fortune-Telling Stall
    Yao Wenyuan
    Those who like to walk around when they go out probably see more than those who always sit in cars. To find novel things, you don't necessarily have to go to the City God Temple. For example, fortune-tellers' stalls. On the streets of Shanghai, you can see various names: "Zhang Iron Mouth," "Surpasses Zhuge," "Little Immortal," "Plum Blossom Pavilion Owner," "Mr. Guiguzi"... and so on. The stalls usually have couplets like "Observe your essence, qi, and spirit to know fortune and misfortune" and "Divine calculation is wonderfully useful, predicting the unknown." Sometimes, it really feels out of sync with 20th-century Shanghai, which has already entered socialism, but it is, after all, a reality that has not yet disappeared. Facts are clearer than any theory. This one thing, if you think about it carefully, can lead to many questions.
    I like to watch the excitement. Today is Sunday, and I saw that a "Plum Blossom Pavilion Owner" was doing quite well, with many people surrounding the stall to watch the fun. I squeezed into a corner too. When the woman who was asking if her son's illness could be cured left with a grateful look, the pavilion owner, wearing dark glasses, suddenly raised his eyebrows and shouted at me:
    "Single character divination, two jiao!"
    I was taken aback and immediately at a loss. He continued:
    "Asking about love and marriage, unrequited love, choosing a partner, giving birth and raising children, this pavilion owner can all point you in the right direction!"
    I declined his enthusiasm for "pointing me in the right direction" and casually asked:
    "How many people seek your advice every day?"
    "Not many." Seeing that I was not a customer, his mood dropped, and he said in a lazy voice: "Maybe five, six, ten or so. We are not practicing superstition now, but pointing people in the right direction!" At this moment, a middle-aged woman with a sallow complexion and anxious eyebrows came to consult him. He quickly raised his hand and shouted, "Tear a small piece of paper from the cloth outside, ask whatever you want by tearing it, you don't even need to tell me your name, I know it, this is the latest scientific principle!"
    I didn't finish watching this performance and walked away. On the road, I silently calculated: if there are one hundred fortune-tellers in Shanghai, and each person "points the way" for only five people a day, that's five hundred people a day, which means 180,000 people (times) ask them to "point the way" in a year! ... I myself don't believe this huge number, but the existence of the fortune-telling profession, and the fact that fortune-tellers can maintain their livelihood, proves that this number is not impossible. What's more, the method of fortune-telling now has an added guise of "scientific principles."
    I thought of an article by a certain gentleman, who believed that there was no need to bring up the study of Marxism-Leninism in the current Hundred Flowers Campaign, because after seven years of propaganda, this was already "not a problem." I don't know what this "not a problem" is based on, but the fact is: even changing the backward psychology and habits of the backward parts of the people still requires a lot of extremely arduous work! In a city like Shanghai, there are still such medieval relics, and the countryside can be imagined. We must not only continue to strengthen the propaganda of Marxism-Leninism and the criticism of bourgeois ideology, but also the most basic scientific knowledge—the laws of birth, aging, sickness, and death, the causes of lightning, rain, and snow, whether there are heavens, hells, and afterlife, whether there are gods, ghosts, and souls—all require a lot of explanation and propaganda. We have fresh memories of the many rumors spread by counter-revolutionaries who exploit the superstitious psychology of the people.
    Anyone who thinks that everything will be fine after the "Hundred Flowers Campaign" and that ideological education work can be relaxed and they can close the door and sleep should go to a fortune-telling stall and observe.

    算命摊旁的杂感
    姚文元
    凡是出门喜欢走走的人，大概比总是坐在汽车里的人见识要多一些。要寻找新奇的事情，正不必到城隍庙去。例如算命先生的摊子吧，在上海的马路上，你就可以看到各色各样的名字：“张铁嘴”“赛诸葛”“小神仙”“梅花馆主”“鬼谷子先生”……等等。摊子上照例有“观君精气神，能知祸与福”“神算妙用，未卜先知”之类的对句。有时看上去，真觉得和已经进入社会主义的二十世纪的上海不调和，但它毕竟是一种尚未消失的现实。事实比一切理论更鲜明，即此一事，仔细想一想，是可以引出不少问题来的。
    我是喜欢看热闹的，今天星期天，看见一家“梅花馆主”生意颇好，好些人围着摊子在看热闹，我也就挨进一只角里去了。当那个问儿子的病能不能医好的女人带着一脸感激的神色快步离开时，戴一付黑眼镜的馆主突然双眉一扬，向我喝道：
    “单测字，两角钱！”
    我大吃一惊，顿时手足无措。他却接下去说：
    “问恋爱结婚，失恋单恋，挑选对象，生子育女，本馆主都可指示方向！”
    我谢绝了他“指示方向”的热情，随口问了一句：
    “每天向你讨教的有多少人？”
    “不多。”他看见我并非主顾，情绪就低落了，用一种懒懒的声音说：“大概五六个十来个吧。我们现在不是迷信了，是为人家指点个方向！”这时又有一个面色蜡黄眉带焦虑的中年妇女来请教他了，他连忙举手喊道：“你在外面布头上撕一张小纸条，问什么撕什么，你不讲我就晓得你姓名，这是最新的科学原理！”
    我没有看完这场表演，走开了。路上默默算着：如果全上海有一百个算命先生，每个人每天只替五个人“指示方向”，一天五百个，那一年就有十八万人（次）请他们“指示方向”！……这个巨大的数字连我自己都不相信，但算命这一种职业还存在，算命先生的生活还能维持，就证明了这个数字并非不可能的。何况，算命方法现在又多了一块“科学原理”的幌子。
    我想起一位先生的一篇文章，他认为现在百家争鸣中不用提出学习马克思列宁主义，因为经过七年宣传，这早已“不成问题”了。我不知道这“不成问题”是根据什么而来的，事实却是：即使改变人民中间落后部分的落后的心理和习惯，都还要做多少极艰苦的工作！在上海这样的城市尚且有这种中世纪的遗迹，农村更可以想见。我们不但要继续加强马克思列宁主义的宣传和批判资产阶级思想，就是最普通的科学知识——生老病死的规律和雷电雨雪的起因，有没有天堂、地狱和来世，有没有神鬼和灵魂，都还需要作许多解释和宣传。反革命分子利用人民的迷信心理而散布的许多谣言，我们是记忆犹新的。
    谁如果以为“百家争鸣”以后就万事大吉，思想教育工作可以放松一下而关起门来睡大觉，那么，最好请他到算命摊旁观察一下。
