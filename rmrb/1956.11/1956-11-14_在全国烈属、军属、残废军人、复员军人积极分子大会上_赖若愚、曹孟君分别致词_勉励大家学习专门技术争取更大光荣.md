Xinhua News Agency, 13th – At the National Congress of Active Elements of Families of Revolutionary Martyrs, Military Dependents, Disabled Veterans, and Demobilized Soldiers in Socialist Construction, Lai Ruoyu, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and Cao Mengjun, Secretary of the Secretariat of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, delivered congratulatory speeches today.

Lai Ruoyu expressed his respect to the delegates on behalf of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions in his speech. He said, "In the past years of war, you contributed your strength and paid a noble price. Now that our country is engaged in socialist construction, you are still devoting your strength, as in the past, to creative labor." He also said, "In socialist construction, the most important thing is technology. Therefore, I hope that when you participate in a certain production, you should carry forward the spirit of collectivism and courage to overcome difficulties, strive to learn specialized skills, and continuously improve yourselves." In his speech, he also hoped that the trade union organizations in factories, mines, enterprises, transportation, culture, and education departments should actively and patiently help the families of revolutionary martyrs, military dependents, disabled veterans, and demobilized soldiers who participate in production to learn technology, improve their skills, and pay attention to solving the difficulties of the families of revolutionary martyrs, military dependents, disabled veterans, and demobilized soldiers in production and life, so that they can engage in production happily.

Cao Mengjun, in her speech, thanked the women representatives of the families of revolutionary martyrs and military dependents on behalf of the National Democratic Women's Federation. She said, "After your children or husbands joined the army, you bravely took on the tasks they left behind, especially the families of martyrs, who were able to contribute all their strength to the people. This noble patriotic enthusiasm will always be a model for women across the country to learn from."

At the end of her speech, Cao Mengjun encouraged the women representatives of the families of revolutionary martyrs and military dependents to pay attention to uniting all the families of revolutionary martyrs and military dependents around them, especially the women among them, to understand their difficulties, discuss solutions together, and help them participate in production peacefully and actively to strive for greater glory. She also hoped that women's federations at all levels should assist and urge all relevant parties to help the women of the families of revolutionary martyrs and military dependents improve their socialist consciousness and pay attention to taking care of and solving their personal difficulties, so that they can play a greater role in the construction of the motherland.

    曹孟君在致词中代表全国民主妇联感谢烈属、军属中的妇女代表们，她说：“你们在儿女或丈夫参军以后勇敢地把他们留下的任务担当起来，尤其是烈士家属们，能为人民贡献出自己的一切力量。这种崇高的爱国主义热情，永远是全国妇女学习的榜样。”
    曹孟君在致词结束时，勉励烈属、军属中的妇女代表回去后，注意团结周围所有的烈、军属，尤其是其中的妇女们，了解她们的困难，并且共同商量解决的办法，帮助她们安心地积极地参加生产，共同争取更大的光荣。她还希望各级妇联组织，要协助和督促各有关方面，帮助烈属、军属中的妇女提高社会主义觉悟和注意照顾与解决她们的切身困难，以便她们能在祖国建设中发挥更大的作用。
