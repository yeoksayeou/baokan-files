    Shaoxing's Restaurants
    Hai Ya
    Walking on the streets of Shaoxing, seeing one small restaurant after another, I couldn't help but think of the layout of the Zhen's restaurants described by Mr. Lu Xun in "Kong Yiji". Most of them still have a right-angled counter facing the street. I once saw a restaurant that was founded in the late Qing Dynasty and now hangs a sign of a joint state-private ownership store. The layout of this store has remained unchanged over the years, and even the cash box for storing copper coins in the right-angled counter is still there today. However, when I talked to the shopkeeper, I realized that although the layout is roughly the same as before, the past and present are very different.
    The shopkeeper was a waiter in the restaurant during the Qing Dynasty. After the Xinhai Revolution, he bought the restaurant and has been running it ever since. He knows the situation of the restaurant very well. According to him, in the past, besides craftsmen, most of the drinkers were minor officials and vagrants. Many people owed money for wine, sometimes the accounts were very high, but later they could not find the debtors. There were also people who got drunk and lay on the floor of the shop, rolling around and making trouble. Most of these people had poor living conditions. Now, the main customers are handicraft workers. Very few people owe money. However, the restaurant is very accommodating. If regular customers forget to bring money or are short of money a few days before payday, they can also owe it for a day or two, but they will pay it back within a day or two. Therefore, the blackboard for recording debts is now mostly used for other purposes, either to mark the prices of various wines and hang them at the entrance of the store, or to record which customer has borrowed the wine vessels. In the past, very few restaurants sold meat dishes. Now, very few restaurants do not sell meat dishes. More and more customers are using smoked fish, white chicken, and salted shrimp as appetizers. Some more upscale restaurants also hang a radio broadcast loudspeaker in front of the shop, so that people can listen to Shaoxing opera and news while drinking.
    There are also more than 130 restaurants and more than 40 liquor stalls in Shaoxing City. It is said that Shaoxing people regard drinking as a kind of relaxation, and some regard wine as a tonic to strengthen the body. Regardless of how much sense these views make, there are almost no people who drink themselves into a drunken stupor, are down and out, or use alcohol to drown their sorrows.

    绍兴的酒店
    海芽
    走在绍兴的街上，看到一爿爿门面不大的酒店，不禁使人想起鲁迅先生在“孔乙己”里描写的鲁镇的酒店的格局来，当街大都还是一个曲尺形的大柜台。我曾经看到一爿始创于前清、如今挂着公私合营店牌的酒店，这店历年来格局不变，连曲尺形大柜台里储铜钿的钿斗今天还在。不过当我和店里掌柜的一谈，才知道虽然格局大体如旧，然而今昔已大不相同了。
    掌柜的在前清时候是酒店的伙计，辛亥革命后买了这爿店，一直开到现在，关于酒店的情形，他可算熟知了。据他谈，从前喝酒的除手艺工人外，大都是衙门小吏和流民。拖欠酒钱的人不少，有时候帐挂得很多，后来却找不到挂帐的欠主。喝醉了酒躺在店堂地上打滚胡闹的也有。这类人大多数生活境遇不好。现在，主要的喝酒顾客是手工业工人。欠帐的极少，不过店里很通融，如果熟主顾一时忘了带钱或者发工钱的前几天手头不便，也可以欠一欠，但也都只欠一两天就还的。所以先前记欠帐的粉板，现在大多作了别用，或者标明各类酒的价格挂在店门口，或者记明盛酒的器皿借给了某某主顾。过去卖荤菜的酒店很少，现在不卖荤菜的酒店很少，用熏鱼、白鸡、盐水虾下酒的主顾多起来了。阔气一些的酒店，店堂前还挂上一只无线电广播喇叭，喝酒的人，一边喝酒，一边可以听听绍剧和新闻。
    绍兴市还有一百三十多家酒店，四十多个酒摊。据说绍兴人把喝酒作为一种休息，也有把酒看为强身的补剂的。这些看法究竟有多少道理，且不管，不过，喝酒喝得烂醉如泥，潦倒颓唐，借酒浇愁的人几乎已绝无仅有。
