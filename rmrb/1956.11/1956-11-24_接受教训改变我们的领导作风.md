Response to Criticism

    Accepting Lessons to Change Our Leadership Style
    Yang Zhimin, Secretary of the CPC Quyang County Committee

    Editor's Note: After this newspaper published a letter from Comrade Cui Xuming and others on the issue of dense planting of corn in Quyang on August 28, it published the initial inspection opinions of the Baoding Prefectural Committee and articles by Comrades Wang Ping and Yuan Jiwu on October 13. It is understood that after various efforts, the majority of Quyang's corn still increased production this year (Wang and Yuan's articles stated that the yield reduction was based on the then-current estimates and the situation in some areas). However, the Quyang County Committee did not relax its inspection of its leadership style because of the partial increase in production. As Comrade Yang Zhimin said in his article, the victory would have been greater if these mistakes had not been made. Such an examination is very necessary and will be of great benefit to improving leadership ideology and work style in the future.

    The People's Daily published the lessons learned from the reduction in corn production in Quyang County and the inspection by the CPC Baoding Prefectural Committee on October 13. We basically agree with the criticisms of Comrades Wang Ping and Yuan Jiwu and the inspection by the Baoding Prefectural Committee. Our county committee also bears great responsibility for this issue. Because we were overwhelmed by victory and developed a sense of pride and complacency in our thinking, we were subjective and did not proceed from the actual situation. In order to catch up with the advanced, under the influence of An Guo's high yield targets, we blindly set the county's total output target at 350 million jin (the regular three-fixed output was about 100 million jin) without considering the specific conditions of our county. To achieve this impossible target, we over-demanded the planting of high-yield crops. For example, the initial plan was to plant 240,000 mu of Baima Tooth corn. After several revisions, the final actual planting was 76,618 mu. This year, although the prefectural committee's technical guidance on corn had some problems (too dense), the county committee did not develop a reasonable requirement based on the specific conditions of the county and the planting habits of the masses. Instead, it rigidly implemented the prefectural committee's requirements downwards, regardless of soil conditions, uniformly using a row spacing of one chi eight cun and a plant spacing of one chi eight cun to two chi, with 3,500 to 4,000 plants per mu. To achieve this unreasonable standard, the method of measuring and sowing with a ruler was adopted. If this quota was violated, criticism and deduction of work points would be imposed. After sowing, it was discovered that the plants were too dense and not growing well, so the masses were asked to pull them out. The masses were dissatisfied and said, "You told us to plant more, and now you tell us to pull them out." An old man of sixty from Xiyangping said: "The Communist Party is good at everything, but pulling corn is not good. I have lived for sixty years, and this is the first time I have pulled corn." According to rough estimates, the pulling of seedlings due to the excessive planting density wasted about 22,000 man-days, 120,000 jin of seeds, and 100 million jin of fertilizer. The several items totaled about 600,000 jin of grain. The losses from intercropping corn in wheat fields were also serious.

    After strengthening field management, increasing fertilizer application (about fifteen carts per mu), irrigating with urine, and artificial pollination, most of the Baima Tooth corn still yielded more than the local corn, with an average increase of about 67 jin per mu. Only about 20,000 mu experienced yield reductions due to planting on slopes and improper technical measures. The total yield reduction was 2.05 million jin.

    Due to our subjectivism, failing to proceed from reality, failing to humbly listen to the opinions of the masses, and failing to combine advanced scientific technology with the production experience of the broad masses of farmers, we not only caused an economic loss of 2.05 million jin of grain but also seriously alienated ourselves from the masses politically, creating a negative impact on the Party.

    Our bureaucracy was also quite serious. The county committee required about 20,000 jin of fertilizer to be applied per mu this spring. The townships were criticized by the county committee for failing to complete this task. Later, the masses reported that they had completed it, but the actual amount was far from sufficient. Because the county committee only wanted to hear about achievements and did not want to hear about shortcomings, the phenomenon of subordinates deceiving their superiors increased. For example, the Lianfeng Cooperative in Kangjiazhuang originally reported planting 21 mu of tobacco, but an inspection revealed that only 2.4 mu were planted.

    Due to the subjectivism and bureaucracy of the county committee's leadership, commandism developed at the lower levels. How did the county committee implement this unrealistic plan and mechanical operating procedures? It used the banner of opposing conservative thinking and used coercive measures to complete it. If cadres and the masses did not implement this plan, they were considered to have conservative thinking. If Party members and cadres could not be persuaded, they would be criticized or punished for violating the county committee's resolutions. If cooperative cadres did not implement it, they would be reprimanded or dismissed. If cooperative members did not follow the operating procedures, their work points would be deducted. For example, Comrade Ma Huichuan, deputy secretary of the Fourth District Committee, could not accept it, and the county committee criticized him for having conservative thinking and not accepting new things; Zhang Gengchen (a Party member) from Xidi Village was placed on probation within the Party for one year (already corrected) for not following the operating procedures. The county committee also used him as a typical example to be circulated throughout the county; the production team leader of Qilizhuang in the First District was dismissed for not implementing the plan; the Third Production Team replanted because the sowing did not meet the specifications. The phenomenon of deducting work points from cooperative members during cultivation was too numerous to mention. More than ten cadres were punished or dismissed during the spring sowing. Under such rigid orders, the broad masses of cooperative members dared not express their opinions even if they had them, and they had to complete the task even if they did not agree. For example, Zhang Wenke, deputy secretary of the Qilizhuang branch, said when sowing intercropped corn, "I know it's too early, but who wants to be punished? Let's plant it! Even if we can't harvest the grain, the government won't let us starve."

    Why did we make such mistakes? The root cause is that after the collectivization, the county committee overestimated the favorable conditions in its work and underestimated the existing difficulties. This tendency toward rash advance caused certain losses to the work and fostered a commandist style at the lower levels. From this, we draw two lessons: First, it is necessary to correctly assess various conditions. When difficulties arise in the course of progress, emphasizing or excessively emphasizing the difficulties and failing to discover and fully utilize the positive factors in the difficulties easily leads to rightist deviations; in times of victory, only seeing or excessively exaggerating the victory and failing to discern and prevent and overcome the dark side of the victory easily leads to "leftist" errors. The other is that when deciding on issues, attention should be paid to listening to opinions from all sides and conducting full discussions in order to correctly understand and resolve contradictions. It is right to attach importance to and implement the resolutions of the higher levels, but when these resolutions do not coincide with the actual situation at the lower levels or when the masses raise different opinions, the actual situation and the opinions of the lower levels should be considered. If the resolutions need to be revised or supplemented, suggestions should be made to the higher levels in a timely manner. It is wrong to be responsible only to the resolutions of the higher levels and not to be responsible to the actual situation and the masses. The county committee has precisely made the above mistakes. If we had not made these mistakes, the victory would have been greater. According to the spirit of the central government's instructions to affirm achievements, overcome shortcomings, consolidate victories, and continue to move forward, the county committee has put forward the following suggestions for improving leadership:

    1. We must conscientiously study the documents of the Eighth National Congress and the instructions of the central government. When formulating plans, we must first solicit opinions from bottom to top and then revise them from top to bottom, combining the top and the bottom. Under the premise of completing the national plan, agricultural cooperatives can freely formulate their own production plans according to their needs and possibilities. The county committee should not be too rigid.

    2. When promoting technical reforms and advanced experiences, the policy must be active and not conservative, but the methods must be adapted to local conditions, and the steps must be steady and prudent, not rash. Promotion must be based on the principle of voluntary participation by the masses. Even if it can indeed increase production, anything that the cadres and masses of agricultural cooperatives are unwilling to accept must be demonstrated and persuaded before it can be promoted, and it cannot be forcibly promoted.

    3. Strengthen ideological education of cadres, enliven democratic life, use the spirit of criticism and self-criticism to examine leadership, promote democracy, place leadership under the supervision of the masses, and promote the mass line of work style to avoid commandism.

    4. Strengthen the collective leadership of the county committee and establish various systems. The work achievements of Quyang County are great, but the shortcomings are also serious. We must summarize successful experiences, accept the lessons of failure, and continue to move forward in consolidating victory.

### 接受教训改变我们的领导作风

专栏：对批评的反应

    接受教训改变我们的领导作风
    中共曲阳县委书记　杨志民
    编者按　本报8月28日发表了崔旭明等同志对曲阳玉米密植问题的来信后，10月13日发表了保定地委的初步检查意见和王平、袁继武同志的文章。据了解，曲阳玉米后来经过各方面的努力，今年大部仍然得到增产（王、袁文章曾说减产是根据当时的估计和部分地区的情况）。但曲阳县委并不因为部分增产而放松对自己领导作风的检查。正如杨志民同志文章中所说的，如果不犯这些错误，胜利将会更大些。这样的检查，是很必要的，对于今后改进领导思想作风，会有很大好处。
    人民日报10月13日发表了记取曲阳县玉米减产的教训及中共保定地委的检查，我们基本上同意王平、袁继武同志的批评，和保定地委的检查。我们县委在这一问题上也负有很大的责任。由于我们在胜利面前冲昏了头脑，在思想上产生了骄傲自满情绪，主观主义，不从实际情况出发，为了赶先进，在安国的高产化的影响下，不看本县的具体条件，盲目地将全县产量指标订为三亿五千万斤（常年三定产量订约一亿斤）。为了达到这个不可能实现的指标，过高要求多种高产作物。如白马牙玉米先计划种二十四万亩，经几次修改，最后实种七万六千六百一十八亩。今年对玉米的技术指导，虽然地委规定的有些毛病（太密），县委也没有根据本县的具体情况和群众的种植习惯订出一个合理要求，而是按着地委的要求硬性地向下贯彻，不看土质条件一律是行距一尺八株距一尺八到二尺，每亩三千五到四千棵。为了达到这个不合理标准，采取尺量播种办法，如果违犯这个定额，即要批评和扣工分。播种完成后，发觉太密生长不好，又让群众拔掉，群众不满地说，让多种也是你们，让拔掉也是你们。西羊平一个六十岁的老人说：共产党什么也好，就是拔玉米不好，我活了六十年，拔玉米这还是第一次。据粗略估计，由于种植太密拔苗这中间浪费人工约二万二千多个，种子约十二万斤，肥料约一亿斤。几项折粮约计六十万斤。麦田间作玉米损失也很严重。
    白马牙玉米后来经过加强田间管理，增施肥料（每亩约十五车），灌尿，人工授粉等措施，绝大部分比本地玉米还是增了产，每亩平均约增六十七斤。只有二万来亩因种在山坡和技术措施不当减了产。共计减产二百零五万斤。
    由于我们主观主义不从实际出发，不虚心听取群众的意见，不能把先进的科学技术与广大农民生产经验结合起来，不但在经济上造成减产二百零五万斤粮食的损失，在政治上严重地脱离了群众，给党造下了不良的影响。
    我们的官僚主义也相当严重。县委在今春要求每亩施肥二万斤左右，各乡说完不成受到了县委的批评，后来群众就报告完成了，实际相差很远。因为县委只愿意听成绩，不愿意听缺点，下级欺骗领导的现象也多起来。如康家庄联丰社原报种烟二十一亩，经检查只种二亩四分。
    由于县委领导上的主观主义、官僚主义，促使下边发展了命令主义。县委对这个脱离实际的计划和机械的操作规程怎样执行的呢？就是用反保守思想的招牌、用强迫命令的手段来完成的。干部群众不执行这个计划，即是保守主义思想。党员干部搞不通，即是违犯县委决议要受批评或处分。社干部不执行即要受斥责或撤职。社员不按规程办事，即要扣工分。如四区区委副书记马汇川同志接受不了，县委批评他保守思想不接受新鲜事物；西邸村张更辰（党员）未按操作规程办事，即受到留党察看一年处分（已纠正），县委并把他当典型通报全县；一区七里庄生产队长不执行计划，遭到撤职；第三生产队播种不符合规格又进行反工。在社员耕作时扣工分的现象是举不胜举的。在春播中受处分和撤职的干部即十余名。在这样硬性命令的情况下，使广大社员有意见也不敢发表、不同意也要完成。如七里庄副总支书张文科在播种间作玉米时群众反映早，他答复说：我也知道早，谁受处分有瘾呢？让种就种吧！收不了粮食政府也不让饿着。
    我们为什么会犯这样错误呢？追其根源是县委在合作化以后，过高估计了工作中的有利条件，低估了目前存在的困难条件。这种急燥冒进的倾向，给工作造成了一定的损失，助长了下边的强迫命令的作风。从这里我们得出两条教训：一是要正确估计各种条件，在前进中发生困难的时候，只强调或者过分强调困难，不善于发现困难中的积极因素加以充分利用，就容易犯右倾偏向；在胜利的时候，只看见或者过分的夸大胜利，不善于洞悉胜利中的阴暗面而加以防止和克服，就容易犯左的错误。另一条是当决定问题的时候，应注意倾听各方面的意见，开展充分讨论，以便正确认识矛盾解决矛盾。重视上级决议，执行上级决议是应该的，但当这些决议和下边实际情况不相吻合或者群众提出不同意见的时候，应当考虑实际情况和下面的意见。如果决议需要修正补充，就要及时的向上级提出建议。任何只对上级决议负责，对实际情况和群众不负责任都是错误的。县委恰恰是犯了上述错误。如果我们不犯这些错误，胜利是更大的。根据中央指示肯定成绩，克服缺点，巩固胜利，继续前进的精神，县委提出以下几点改进领导的意见。
    一、要认真学习八大会议文件和中央指示，在制定计划时首先要自下而上的征求意见，再自上而下进行修改，上下相结合，在完成国家计划前题下农业社可以自由按自己的需要与可能制定自己生产计划。县委不应卡的太死。
    二、在推行技术改革和先进经验时，方针必须积极不能保守，但做法必须因地制宜，步骤必须稳妥慎重，不能冒进。推广时必须根据群众自愿的原则。凡是农业社干部群众不愿接受的，即使确实能够增产，也要经过示范说服，不能强迫推广。
    三、加强干部思想教育，活跃民主生活，用批评与自我批评精神，检查领导，发扬民主使领导处于群众的监督之下，推行群众路线工作作风来避免强迫命令发生。
    四、加强县委集体领导，建立各种制度。曲阳县的工作成绩是巨大的，但缺点也是严重的，我们要总结成功经验，接受失败教训，在巩固胜利中继续前进。
