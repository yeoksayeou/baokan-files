    People from All Walks of Life in the Capital Hold a Rally to Support Egypt's Resistance Against Anglo-French Aggression
    Telegram Regarding Support for the Egyptian People's Resistance Against Anglo-French Aggression
    We extend our highest respect to our Egyptian brothers and sisters who are bravely defending their homeland, resisting Anglo-French aggression, and safeguarding peace!
    Dear Egyptian brothers and sisters, we are hearing the Anglo-French aggressors' artillery bombard your land, our blood is boiling, and we are filled with indignation. The Anglo-French imperialists, in order to reoccupy the Suez Canal and carry out colonial rule over Egypt and Arab countries, have disregarded the peaceful wishes of the people of the world, instigated Israel to launch an armed attack on Egypt, and directly launched a war of aggression against Egypt. This is not only a serious provocation against the Egyptian people and the Arab people, but also a provocation against the people of Asia, Africa, and the world. All peace-loving countries and people in the world unanimously condemn and denounce this barbaric act of armed aggression against Egypt and the destruction of world peace.
    We, the Chinese people, have always stood firmly with you, defending world peace, and now we must use our greatest strength to support your war against aggression.
    Forward! Brave Egyptian brothers and sisters! Under the leadership of President Nasser, drive out all aggressors and defend the independence and freedom of the motherland!
    The Chinese people and the Egyptian people are hand in hand, the Asian and African people are hand in hand, and the people of the world are hand in hand, uniting strongly to advance together to extinguish the flames of aggression.
    Justice is on the side of Egypt, and we firmly believe that the just struggle of the Egyptian people will surely achieve final victory!
    Long live the Egyptian people who bravely defend their motherland and resist aggression!
                  People from All Walks of Life in the Capital of China Hold a Rally to Support Egypt's Resistance Against Anglo-French Aggression

    首都各界人民支援埃及反抗英法侵略大会
    关于支援埃及人民反抗英法侵略的电文
    我们向英勇保卫祖国、反抗英法侵略和维护和平的埃及兄弟姊妹致崇高的敬礼！
    亲爱的埃及兄弟姊妹们，我们听到英法侵略者的炮火轰炸你们的国土，我们热血沸腾，万分愤慨。英法帝国主义者为了重新占领苏伊士运河、对埃及及阿拉伯国家进行殖民统治，竟不顾世界人民的和平愿望，唆使以色列向埃及武装进攻，并且直接发动侵略埃及的战争，这不仅是对埃及人民和阿拉伯人民的严重挑衅，而且也是对亚非人民和全世界人民的挑衅。全世界爱好和平的国家和人民一致谴责和声讨这种武装侵略埃及、破坏世界和平的野蛮行为。
    我们中国人民一向坚定不移地和你们站在一起，维护世界和平，现在更要用最大的力量来支援你们的反侵略的战争。
    前进吧！英勇的埃及兄弟姊妹们！在纳赛尔总统的领导下，赶走一切侵略者，保卫祖国的独立和自由！
    中国人民和埃及人民手牵着手，亚非人民手牵着手，全世界人民手牵着手，坚强地团结起来，为扑灭侵略的战火共同前进。
    正义是在埃及方面，我们坚信：埃及人民的正义斗争一定能够取得最后胜利！
    英勇保卫祖国和反抗侵略的埃及人民万岁！
                  中国首都各界人民支援埃及反抗英法侵略大会
                                        1956年11月3日
