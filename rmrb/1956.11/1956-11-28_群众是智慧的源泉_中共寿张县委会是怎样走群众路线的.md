The Masses Are the Source of Wisdom
——How the CCP Shou Zhang County Committee Follows the Mass Line
By our reporter Xiao Yan

    Shou Zhang County, Shandong Province, achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest this year. The total grain output this year was more than 72.5 million jin more than last year, an increase of more than 41% over last year. If it weren't for the Yellow River flood, which submerged more than 70,000 mu of fertile land, the harvest would have been even greater. The yields per mu of the three most widely planted crops in the county—wheat, soybeans, and corn—all far exceeded those of last year. The results of raising pigs for manure accumulation this year are outstanding: in just over a year, the county has grown from 8,000 pigs to more than 80,000; last year, each mu of land could only receive one cart of manure, but this year it can receive three carts.

    These achievements fully demonstrate the superiority of the county's full realization of advanced agricultural cooperativization. At the same time, it is inseparable from the CCP Shou Zhang County Committee's continuous improvement of its leadership style and its implementation of the mass line.
  　Before Decisions Are Made
    The Shou Zhang County leadership has had failures in agricultural production. In 1952, without investigation or research, the county committee subjectively decided to plant 8,000 mu of kenaf (small hemp) in the Yellow River riverbed area that had been flooded. At the time, some farmers said that there was no tradition of planting kenaf in the riverbed area and advocated planting soybeans. However, the county committee emphasized that kenaf was not afraid of flooding and promoted it as a "good way to produce for disaster relief and resist America and aid Korea," saying, "Soybeans are low-yield crops and are afraid of flooding and will not produce a harvest." Some cadres even said, "Only special agents and bad eggs would want us to plant beans here that cannot produce grain!" With such accusations, who would dare to object! But in the autumn, kenaf only yielded a dozen jin per mu, while some farmers who planted soybeans harvested very well. The farmers' criticism of the subjective leadership was very sharp: "Look! This 'resist America and aid Korea' kenaf doesn't even yield as much as 'special agent beans'!"

    Every detour has deeply educated us: we must proceed from reality in everything, we must adapt to local conditions based on the specific conditions, and in particular, we must consult with the masses and follow the mass line. The CCP Shou Zhang County Committee has learned a lot about following the mass line from many practical tasks. For example, before deploying important work, the county committee always conducts investigations and research before making a decision. First, consult with district cadres, and conduct investigations with township, commune cadres, and farmers. Then, discuss the materials obtained from the investigation and research carefully. In this way, the decisions made can be in line with the actual situation and avoid deviations.

    Soil improvement is one of the keys to increased production in Shou Zhang County. The county committee has grasped this key correctly. However, in the initial mobilization and organization of forces, because of the overemphasis on the superiority of large-scale collective labor, and seeing the enthusiasm and achievements of collective labor in individual outstanding agricultural cooperatives, when determining the county's annual plan for soil improvement, there was an emotion of demanding too much too quickly, and the number of 150,000 mu of land to be plowed was proposed. Because there was a dispute within the county committee regarding this plan, it was further investigated concretely below. After concrete investigation in the first and sixth districts regarding the workdays required for farmers to turn sand and cover with silt and turn silt and cover with sand, it was proved that the opinions of a few people at the county committee discussion were correct. Finally, it was determined that 100,000 mu of land would be plowed throughout the year (the result was the completion of 120,000 mu).

    In addition, when determining this year's increased planting of some high-yield crops—corn—and how to adjust the area of various crops, the county committee also consulted with district and township cadres, investigated and summarized typical experiences (the Da Li Zhuang Victory Agricultural Cooperative, which has increased soybean production year after year, adopted specific measures such as deep plowing, fertilization, early planting, multiple plowing, and diligent weeding, achieving an average of 241 jin per mu for the entire cooperative, with high yields reaching 746 jin per mu), rejected the opinion of a few people who wanted to desperately reduce the soybean area and proposed planting only 170,000 mu, and still planted more than 232,200 mu of soybeans.

    Last year, some places were affected by late wheat planting, which affected production increases. This year, the higher authorities promptly proposed to seize the opportunity to make a concentrated effort to plant wheat. When the Shou Zhang County Committee deployed this task, it initially only emphasized making a concentrated effort to plant wheat. As a result, when this instruction was implemented in the townships and communes, there was a phenomenon of only focusing on making a concentrated effort to plant wheat, while neglecting the autumn harvest. Based on the situation that the responsible personnel of the county committee personally investigated and understood in Chengpo Township, Fifth District, the county committee accepted the criticism raised by commune members regarding the neglect of the autumn harvest, and immediately notified the entire county emphasizing: "Not only plant wheat well, but also harvest autumn well," and promptly corrected the shortcomings of neglecting the autumn harvest, greatly reducing autumn harvest losses. The wheat planting time for the entire county was still advanced by seven or eight days compared to previous years.

    The CCP Shou Zhang County Committee has achieved more significant results in leading the county's pig-raising and manure accumulation campaign by following the mass line. Although they learned a lot of pig-raising experience from the famous Song Changsheng Agricultural Cooperative in the province, after three or four months of repeated investigation and research last winter and this spring, according to the county's situation and the opinions of the masses, they did not copy Song Changsheng Cooperative's method of mainly raising pigs by the collective, but determined the county's policy of mainly self-breeding and self-raising by commune members.

    The CCP Shou Zhang County Committee often reaches a consensus on many important tasks after full deliberation, heated discussion, and repeated investigation and research. This consensus depends on the county committee's promotion of democracy, especially the fact that everyone truly believes in the masses and can go to be students of the masses at any time, using the wisdom of the masses to enrich the experience of leadership.

    Bring out concrete examples
    The Shou Zhang County Committee is good at using concrete typical examples to educate the masses.

    Let's talk about pig-raising and manure accumulation. The Shou Zhang County Committee considered that the county was too lacking in fertilizer in the past, which affected production increases, so it grasped the key of pig-raising and manure accumulation, which is completely correct. However, the county committee encountered obstacles when initially mobilizing the masses to raise pigs and accumulate manure. They couldn't come up with convincing examples during propaganda, and only talked about general principles such as "The new and old societies are very different," "Increasing production is glorious," and "There are many benefits to raising pigs and accumulating manure." The two examples cited were also from other provinces and counties. The masses and township and commune cadres did not understand. Commune cadres said, "Raising pigs is good, but we don't have the habit of raising pigs here!" Commune members said, "We don't have enough grain, we can't afford to raise them!", "How can the commune have so much money to build pig farms!", ... Fu Shengyu, the township head of Shilijing Township in the Sixth District, said to Liu Chuanyou, the secretary of the county committee: "You are from Shou Zhang County, you should know whether you can raise pigs. Don't you remember that in 1937 you spent a lot of effort raising a pig weighing more than 160 jin, and you didn't sell it cheaply for more than ten yuan because you couldn't afford to feed it." "Look! They're even using concrete examples to try to convince me!" After hearing these responses, Liu Chuanyou deeply realized that without concrete examples, he couldn't convince the masses by only talking about general principles.

    The secretaries and members of the county committee personally led the county and district cadres to help summarize the local masses' experience in raising pigs, and came up with the example of Men Zhaoshan, a pig-raising expert from the Zhao Kaibai Township Agricultural Cooperative, which was very persuasive. Last year, Men Zhaoshan used detailed accounting methods in his family to make the whole family understand the benefits of raising pigs to the country, to the family, and even to the individual. The whole family divided the work and cooperated in feeding. Women were in charge of feeding, men carried water and cleaned the pens, and children helped collect wild vegetables and leaves as substitute feed. Those who participated in raising pigs were rewarded with the money from selling pigs. Last year, his family's net income from raising pigs and accumulating manure was 359 yuan, accounting for 56.2% of his family's total income from agriculture and sideline occupations. In other districts and townships, many vivid and concrete examples were also introduced and visited in person—such as rapid reproduction by raising more sows, dozens of kinds of tree leaves and wild vegetables can be used as feed, cross-breeding should use excellent pig breeds, pig hygiene, disease prevention, and other experiences.

    In addition, many successful examples were also used when promoting new farming techniques such as intercropping and relay cropping, such as intercropping peas and lentils in wheat fields, and intercropping corn in sweet potato fields, to persuade the peasant masses. This year, 30% of the county's cultivated land has implemented intercropping and relay cropping, which is also one of the reasons for the increase in production.

    In Shou Zhang County, the leading cadres of districts, townships, and communes have also slowly learned to adopt the working methods of typical investigation, explaining and educating the masses, and consulting with the masses when encountering problems. They said: "The county committee earnestly and humbly solicits the opinions of the lower levels in everything, and we should be even more humble and consult with the masses!" Several responsible cadres of the county committee also said in unison: The style of the responsible personnel of the CCP Liaocheng Prefectural Committee continuously going down to the countryside, going deep into the masses, earnestly investigating and researching, and listening to the opinions of the masses often has a very direct impact on them.

    Think of the masses at all times
    It is a glorious tradition of the Party to often care about the sufferings of the masses and humbly listen to the voices of the masses. In Shou Zhang County, the county committee has maintained and carried forward this tradition in leading the struggle against Yellow River flooding and waterlogging disasters year after year. After advanced cooperativization, the economic dependence of commune members on the collective has increased. This requires leaders to pay special attention to the various specific requirements and difficulties of the masses. The CCP Zhao Kaibai (Township) Agricultural Cooperative Branch went deep into the homes of commune members to visit and found that three households that should have implemented the "Five Guarantees" had not implemented the "Five Guarantees"; six households of elderly and widowed people had difficulty carrying water by themselves; an old man lived in two open-air houses; three orphans had no cotton clothes; and there were various specific problems such as lack of firewood and discord between mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law. After research by the Party branch, the cooperative committee, and relevant departments, the problems were solved one household at a time. With the direct help of the county committee, the CCP Taiqian Agricultural Cooperative Branch recently conducted two family visits and helped solve the practical difficulties of seven commune members. Liu Xiuyin, the secretary of the branch of this cooperative, is a person who has always cared about the sufferings of the masses. The commune members said: "Whenever there is a storm, our branch secretary can't sit still at home. Regardless of day or night, he has to walk around the village several times, especially to see those families living in old and dilapidated houses." The following is a true story of Liu Xiuyin's selflessness:

    One summer night, a storm came. Liu Xiuyin braved the rain and ran into the house of Liu Daohong, a widowed household. Although the house was already leaking badly, this disabled man in his seventies was unwilling to leave the house. He sighed and said: "I am already a useless person, I will die sooner or later!..." Liu Xiuyin, without hesitation, braved the pouring rain and carried Liu Daohong out of danger. In less than two hours, Liu Daohong's dilapidated house collapsed. The old man deeply felt the warmth of the Party from Liu Xiuyin, and always said: The branch secretary is his life-saving benefactor. It is because there are Communist Party members like Liu Xiuyin, with many party activists and cadres who have close ties with the masses and truly care about the sufferings of the masses, that the Taiqian Agricultural Cooperative Branch is full of vitality. The voices and demands of the masses are known to the branch through the party members; the sufferings of the masses are also more concerned by the cadres. For example, the old breeder had a lot of opinions on the cooperative committee's lack of attention to horse feeding, which was reflected to the branch through party members, which aroused the attention of the cooperative committee and added fodder to the horses during heavy work. It was also because some party members paid attention to the voices of the commune members while working in the fields and suggested that the cooperative committee adopt the method of publicizing work point accounts and grain distribution accounts, that it was found that the work recorder had indeed recorded more work points for his own family. Liu Xiuyin said: "In the past, I couldn't listen to unsatisfactory reflections. When I heard them, I didn't believe them very much, and even said that this was sabotage. But now I have studied the 'Eighth National Congress' documents and understand how to correctly listen to and treat all kinds of opinions. As long as the party organization is willing to listen to and respect the opinions of the masses, they will say: 'The cadres and party members are really one with us!'"

    The Shou Zhang County Committee attaches great importance to strengthening the political and ideological education of the broad masses of party members in rural grassroots organizations—general branches and branches (the county's party lesson system is well maintained). In particular, it requires grassroots organizations and every party member to always care about the sufferings of the masses, listen to and reflect the voices and opinions of the masses. Because these grassroots organizations and party members are the reliable forces for implementing the Party's mass line.

    群众是智慧的源泉
    ——中共寿张县委会是怎样走群众路线的
    本报记者　肖彦
    山东省的寿张县，今年获得了空前的丰收。今年粮食总产量，比去年多收七千二百五十多万斤；比去年增产41％以上。如果不是黄河水灾，比去年多淹了七万余亩良田，收获会更大些。全县种植面积最多的三种作物——小麦、大豆和玉米的单位面积产量，都远远超过了去年。今年养猪积肥的成绩很突出：一年多以来全县由八千头猪，发展到八万多头；去年每亩地只能上一车粪，今年能上三车粪。
    这些成绩，充分显示了全县全部实现了高级农业合作化的优越性。同时这与中共寿张县委能不断改进领导作风，贯彻群众路线的作风也是分不开的。
  　出决定之前
    寿张县领导农业生产并不是没有失败的教训的。1952年县委没有经过调查研究，就主观地决定在被水淹过的黄河河床区，种八千亩洋麻（小麻）。当时就有农民说河床区没有种洋麻的习惯，主张种大豆。县委却强调洋麻不怕水淹，并以“这是生产救灾、抗美援朝的好办法”来进行宣传，说：“大豆是低产作物，怕涝没收成”，甚至有的干部说：“只有特务坏蛋才希望咱们在这里种收不了粮食的豆子哩！”大帽子一扣，谁还敢再反对！可是到了秋天，洋麻每亩地只收了十几斤，而有些农民种下的豆子，却收得很好。农民对主观主义的领导提出的批评非常尖锐：“看！这抗美援朝的洋麻，收成反赶不上‘特务豆’呢！”
    每件走过弯路的事情，都深深地教育我们：必须事事从实际出发，必须根据当地的具体条件因地制宜；特别是必须和群众商量，走群众路线。中共寿张县委便是从许多实际工作中，学到了不少走群众路线的经验。譬如每次布置重要工作，在县委作出决定之前，都是先进行调查研究的。先去和区干部商量，向乡、社干部和农民群众作调查。然后根据调查研究所得的材料再进行认真地讨论。这样，所做出的决定，就能合乎实际情况，避免偏差。
    改良土壤，是寿张县的增产关键之一。县委对这一关键抓对了。但是在最初动员组织力量时，却因为过高地强调了大规模集体劳动的优越性，看到了个别突出的农业社里集体劳动的劲头和成绩，在确定全县改良土壤的全年计划时，就产生了要求过高过急的情绪，提出了翻地十五万亩的数字。这个计划因为县委会里有争论，所以就进一步再到下边去作具体调查，到一区和六区具体调查了农民翻沙盖淤和翻淤盖沙所需的工日以后，证明县委会讨论时，少数人的意见是对的，最后确定：全年翻地十万亩（结果完成了十二万亩）。
    另外，确定今年增种部分高产作物——玉米，如何调剂各种作物的面积的时候，县委也是经过与区、乡干部商量，调查总结了典型经验（大豆年年增产的大李庄胜利农业社采用深耕、施肥、早种、多犁、勤锄等具体措施，达到了全社每亩平均二百四十一斤，其中高额产量达到每亩七百四十六斤），否决了少数人想拚命压缩大豆面积提出只种十七万亩的意见，而仍然种了二十三万二千余亩大豆。
    去年有些地方因为麦子种迟了影响了增产。今年上级及时提出了要抓紧时机突击种麦。寿张县委布置这项任务时，最初也是只单纯地强调突击种麦的。结果这个指示贯彻到乡、社，就发生了光顾突击种麦，而忽视秋收的现象。县委根据县委的负责人员亲自到五区城坡乡调查了解的情况，接受了社员对忽视秋收提出的批评，立即通报全县强调：“不光种好麦，也要收好秋”，及时纠正了忽视秋收的缺点，使秋收损失大大减少。全县种麦时间仍比往年提早了七、八天。
    寿张县委在领导全县开展养猪积肥运动中，走群众路线，取得的效果更显著。他们虽然学习了全省著名的宋长生农业社的许多养猪经验，但是经过他们去冬今春三、四个月的反复调查研究，根据本县的情况和群众的意见，却没有搬用宋长生社以公养为主的作法，确定了本县以社员自繁自养为主的方针。
    寿张县委对许多重要工作，经常是经过充分酝酿，热烈讨论，反复调查研究才取得一致意见的。这种一致，取决于县委发扬了民主，特别是大家都真正相信群众，而能随时去当群众的学生，用群众的智慧来丰富领导的经验。
    拿出具体的例子来
    寿张县委是善于用具体的典型事例来教育群众的。
    还是来谈谈养猪积肥的事吧。寿张县委考虑到过去全县肥料太缺，影响增产，因而抓住养猪积肥这一关键，这是完全正确的。但是县委在最初动员群众养猪积肥时，却碰了钉子。宣传时拿不出有说服力的事例，只讲：“新旧社会大不同”、“增产光荣”、“养猪积肥好处多”等一般的大道理。举两个例子也是外省、外县的。群众和乡、社干部思想都不通。社干部说：“养猪好是好，我们这儿可没有养猪的习惯！”社员说：“粮缺，养不起！”、“社里那有那么多钱修猪场啊！”、……六区十里井乡乡长傅胜玉对县委书记刘传友说：“你是咱寿张县人，能不能养猪该清楚。你不记得1937年你费大劲养了头一百六十多斤的猪，还不是因为喂不起，十多块钱贱卖了。”“看！他们反倒拿出具体的例子想来说服我呢！”刘传友听了这些反映之后，深深体会到：不拿出具体的事例来，光讲大道理是不能说服群众的。
    县委书记和委员们，带领着县、区干部亲自下去帮助总结当地群众养猪的经验，拿出了赵开白乡农业社养猪能手门兆山怎样养猪的例子，就很有说服力了。门兆山去年在自己家庭中，用算细账的办法，使全家都了解养猪对国家、对家庭、以至对个人的好处。全家分工，合力喂养。妇女管喂，男人担水、除圈，小孩帮着采集野菜和树叶作代饲料。养猪卖的钱，参加养猪的都给奖励。去年他家喂猪和积肥除去成本外，纯收益三百五十九元，占他家农副业总收入的56.2％。在其他区、乡也都介绍和实地参观访问了许多生动具体的典型——如多养母猪繁殖快、可用好几十种树叶野菜作饲料、交配要用优良猪种、猪的卫生、防疫等等经验。
    此外，在推广间种套作等新的农作技术时，也是用了许多成功的实例，如小麦地里套种豌豆、扁豆，地瓜（甘薯）地里间种玉米等，说服了农民群众的。今年全县有30％的耕地都实行了间种套作，也是增产的原因之一。
    在寿张县，区、乡、社的领导干部，也慢慢学会了采用典型调查，说明教育群众遇事和群众商量的工作方法。他们说：“县委遇事都认真、虚心地征询下边的意见，我们就更应该虚心和群众商量了！”县委的几个负责干部也都异口同声地说：中共聊城地委的负责人员不断下乡，深入群众，认真地调查研究，听群众意见的作风，常常给他们很直接的影响。
    时时刻刻想到群众
    经常关心群众的疾苦，虚心倾听群众的呼声，是党的光荣传统。在寿张县，县委年年领导与黄河水涝灾害进行斗争中，保持和发扬了这种传统。高级合作化以后，社员在经济上对集体的依附性增大了。这就更需要领导者特别关心群众的各种具体要求和困难。中共赵开白（乡）农业社支部，就是深入到社员家庭中访问，发现了有三户应该实行“五保”的没有实行“五保”；有六户孤寡自己担水吃有困难；有个老大爷住着两间露天房；有三个孤儿没棉衣；另外还有缺柴烧的、婆媳不和等各种具体问题。经过党支部、社委会和有关部门研究后，一户一户地都把问题给解决了。在县委的直接帮助下，中共台前农业社支部，最近也进行了两次家庭访问，帮助解决了七户社员的实际困难。这个社的支部书记刘秀印，是个一贯关心群众疾苦的人。社员们说：“只要遇到暴风大雨，我们的支部书记就在家里坐不住了，不分白天黑夜，他都要在村里走几遭，特别是去看那些住着旧屋破房的人家”。下面就是刘秀印舍己为人的真实的故事：
    一个夏天的深夜，狂风暴雨来了。刘秀印冒雨跑进了孤寡户刘道鸿的屋里。虽然房子已经漏得很厉害，可是这位七十多岁的残废人，还不愿离开这所房子。他叹着气说：“我已经是个不中用的人了，早晚也得死！……”刘秀印却毫不迟疑地冒着倾盆大雨，把刘道鸿背出了险地。没过两个钟头，刘道鸿的破屋便倒塌了。这位老人从刘秀印身上深深感到了党的温暖，总念叨：支部书记是他的救命恩人。就是因为有像刘秀印这样的共产党员，有着许多与群众有紧密联系，真正关心群众疾苦的党员积极分子和干部，使得台前农业社支部里，充满了生气。群众的呼声和要求，通过党员，支部便知道了；群众的疾苦，干部也更关心了。譬如老饲养员对社委会不重视喂马很有意见，就是经过党员向支部反映了，才引起社委会注意，干重活时给马增添了草料的。也是由于有的党员在地里干活留心社员的呼声，建议社委会采取公布工分账、分粮账的办法，才查出了记工员确实给自家多记了工分的事情。刘秀印说：“过去是听不进不满意的反映的，听到时总不大相信，甚至说成这是破坏话。可是现在学习了‘八大’文件，懂得正确倾听和对待各种各样的意见了。只要党组织肯听和尊重群众的意见，他们就说：‘干部、党员真和咱一条心了！’”
    寿张县委很重视加强农村基层组织——总支和支部中广大党员的政治思想教育工作（全县党课制度坚持得很好）。特别是要求基层组织和每个党员都要时刻关心群众的疾苦，倾听和反映群众的呼声和意见。因为这些基层组织和党员，乃是贯彻党的群众路线的可靠力量。
