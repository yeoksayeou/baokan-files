    Postscript to "The Elderly Supervision Post"
    Ma Tieding
      In "The Elderly Supervision Post" (see the supplement to the People's Daily on the 25th), there is an old man, Grandpa Liu. This Grandpa Liu has a particularly endearing quality, which is that he concerns himself with the affairs of others, the affairs of the public, and the affairs of the collective. He seems to be watching you all the time. Did you break the machine? That won't do, he criticizes you; did you not buy something good? That won't do, he points it out to you; haven't you washed your clothes for a long time? He reminds you; is a part missing somewhere, and you are struggling to find where to look? Don't worry, he has a good memory and will tell you immediately.
    Some say that Grandpa Liu has no home and no family, he is just a loner. I want to say that his home is very big, and his family members are many. That home is his factory, and those members are the old and young, male and female employees. He has a dictionary, and in that dictionary, "self" and "individual" are reduced to the smallest extent, while "others" and "collective" shine brightly there.
    My thoughts suddenly grew wings and flew into "There to Friendship and Sympathy" (see the People's Daily on the 24th): On October 14th, the comrades of the Xinhua Bookstore Beijing Branch went on an outing to Badaling and had a car accident, some comrades died, and some were injured. The injured comrades suffered because there were no cars to take them to the hospital. As luck would have it, they managed to stop a car on the road. The Xinhua Bookstore side had requested to borrow the car for a moment, but the car "owner" simply "ignored them." I thought: This car "owner" also has a dictionary, and in that dictionary, self and individual are enlarged, enlarged, enlarged to the point of refusing to save someone in distress.
    If this car "owner" were brought to stand in front of Grandpa Liu, if there was still any shame left in them, they should immediately burrow into a hole in the ground!

    读“老年监督岗”后记
    马铁丁
      “老年监督岗”（见25日人民日报副刊）里，有位刘大爷。这刘大爷有一特别可爱之处，那就是凡是别人的事，众人的事，集体的事，他都得管。他好像时时刻刻都管着你。你把机器弄坏了吗？那不行，他批评你；你买东西买得不好吗？那不行，他指摘你；你的衣服多时没有洗了吗？他提醒你；哪里缺少一个部件，而又苦于不知到那里去找的时候，不要紧，他有一个好记性，马上告诉你。
    有人说刘大爷无家无室，光杆儿一个，我要说，他的家室很大，家庭成员很多，那家室就是他的工厂，那成员就是那老老少少、男男女女的员工们。他有一部字典，那字典里，“自己”、“个人”缩小到最小限度。而“别人”、“集体”在那里闪闪发光。
    我的思想忽然生了翅膀，一飞飞进“友爱和同情那里去了”那篇文章（见24日人民日报）：10月14日那天，新华书店北京分店的同志们到八达岭去郊游，发生翻车惨祸，当时有的同志摔死，有的同志受伤。负伤的同志苦于没有汽车送进医院。事情凑巧，居然在路上截住一部汽车了。新华书店方面曾商借汽车用一下，车“主”竟至“置之不理”。我想：这位车“主”也有部字典，那字典里，自己、个人扩大，扩大，扩大到见死不救。
    如果把这位车“主”拉来站在刘大爷面前，倘羞愧之心尚存，应该立刻钻到地洞里去！
