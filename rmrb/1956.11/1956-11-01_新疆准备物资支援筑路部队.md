According to the Xinjiang Daily: The railway construction troops of the Railway Corps, who are building the Lanzhou-Urumqi-Aktogay railway, are entering the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region one after another.

In order to ensure that the railway construction troops can spend the winter smoothly, various places have prepared a large number of supplies to support the railway construction. Several thousand sets of cotton-padded clothes, several thousand pairs of felt boots, and a large number of cotton wadding, fur hats, and stoves have been prepared in Urumqi and can all be transported to the construction site before the freeze. Various places have prepared more than 12,000 cubic meters of logs and a large amount of finished timber. Trucks dispatched by the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Communications Department Transportation Bureau and the Production and Construction Corps Transportation Office are rushing the timber to the construction site. Tens of thousands of tons of grain have been stored in Hami, Shanshan, Turpan, and Dabancheng, and a large amount of grain is still being transferred from agricultural areas in southern Xinjiang. In terms of the supply of daily necessities and fuel, the Autonomous Region Commerce Department, Petroleum Company, and Xinjiang Military Region Production and Construction Corps have signed supply agreements for daily necessities with the leading organs of the railway construction troops. Materials needed for construction, such as iron wire, iron nails, lime, and hemp rope, have all been prepared for supply. The Autonomous Region Industry Department, Production and Construction Corps, and other units are preparing technical forces to assist the Railway Corps in repairing automobiles and mechanical equipment.

The cultural, educational, health, and postal and telecommunications departments are also mobilizing all forces to support the construction of the railway.
