    Re-examine Working Capital Based on Actual Production Needs
    One Hundred Factories in Shenyang Save More Than 50 Million Yuan
    (Our Newspaper) News: This year, during the second and third quarters, one hundred state-owned and local state-owned factories in the Shenyang area, under the guidance of the central government's overall policy of "greater, faster, better, and more economical," started from improving financial management and saving national financial investment. Based on actual production needs, they re-examined their working capital quotas. The results of the re-examination showed that, except for a few factories whose quotas increased slightly, most factories reduced their quotas by about 19.1%, saving a total of 51.66 million yuan. This money could be used to build a factory the size of the Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Plant.
    According to statistics from thirty-three state-owned factories, such as the Shenyang Smelter and the High-Voltage Switch Factory, the total planned output value this year increased by an average of 47.6% compared to last year, while the working capital quota decreased by 12.6%.
    In this capital re-examination work, the Shenyang Smelter also improved its financial management. For example, in the past, the factory's workshops, sections, and offices all believed that managing money was only the responsibility of the accounting department and lacked a careful budgeting mentality. Now, the factory has formulated a horizontal division of labor system involving relevant departments in the working capital turnover process, and the arrangement of plans, the arrangement of equipment maintenance, and technical supervision must cooperate with financial work. Each functional department has also established professional positions for working capital management. As a result, in the third quarter alone, the factory's working capital turnover was shortened by seven days compared to the original plan.
    Many factories mobilized the masses to clear out stockpiled materials. According to statistics from thirty state-owned factories in Shenyang, overstocked materials worth more than 27 million yuan were cleared out. Currently, many factories are not only strengthening financial management but also incorporating capital indicators into the competition conditions on a monthly and quarterly basis to ensure the completion of the capital plan.

    根据生产实际要求，重新核定流动资金
    沈阳一百个工厂节约资金五千多万
    本报讯　沈阳地区一百个国营和地方国营工厂，今年第二、三季度在执行中央又多、又快、又好、又省的全面方针下，从改善财务管理，节约国家财政投资的要求出发，根据生产实际需要，重新核定流动资金定额。核定的结果，除个别工厂定额稍有增加外，大部分都比年初核定的降低19.1％左右，共五千一百六十六万元。用这些钱，可以建设一座像沈阳第一机床厂那样规模的工厂。
    据沈阳冶炼厂，高压开关厂等三十三个国营工厂统计，今年计划生产总值比去年的平均增加47.6％，而流动资金定额却降低了12.6％。
    沈阳冶炼厂在这次资金核定工作中，还改进了财务管理工作，例如过去工厂车间科室都认为管钱只是会计部门的事，缺乏精打细算的思想。现在工厂制定了流动资金周转过程中有关部门横的分工制度，计划的安排，设备的检修排列以及技术监督等工作都要配合做好财务工作。各职能部门也建立了流动资金管理的专业岗位。结果，仅第三季度全厂流动资金周转就比原计划缩短了七天。
    许多工厂发动群众清查积压的物资。根据沈阳三十个国营工厂的统计，共清查出超额储备物资值二千七百多万元。目前许多工厂不仅加强了财务管理，而且还按月按季把资金指标纳入竞赛条件，保证资金计划的完成。　（文）
