Xinhua News Agency, November 20th dispatch from Damascus: Syrian Prime Minister al-Asali told the parliament on the 17th that Syria is determined to "stand with Egypt and resist the aggression of the three countries (Britain, France, and Israel) to the end."

He also said: "We will not rest assured unless they retreat to the positions from which they began their aggression against Egypt."

Al-Asali warned Britain, France, and Israel to implement the United Nations General Assembly resolution that the troops of the three countries should withdraw from Egypt. He said that the Arab countries are determined to implement the resolutions passed by the Arab heads of state meeting, including that any aggression against Egypt will be considered an aggression against all Arab countries.

Reviewing the development of the situation, al-Asali said that from the very beginning of the aggression launched by Britain, France, and Israel against Egypt, "we, like the whole world, saw through the malicious intentions of these two major powers and their partner Israel. Therefore, we unswervingly chose our own path. We are certain that Britain, France, and Israel are using the Suez Canal as an excuse today to establish their rule, oppose the national liberation movement of the Arab countries, and divide the Arab ranks, and tomorrow they will find other excuses."

Al-Asali pointed out that Egypt's struggle is "our struggle," and "aggression against Egypt is a violation of the survival of all Arabs." He told the parliament: "At the very moment the danger emerged, we did not hesitate to stand by Egypt's side." "We mobilized all our material and moral strength to help Egypt. We received instructions from the joint command to wait and observe the development of the situation, because the battlefield had shifted from Sinai to dealing with the British and French troops' landing operation in the Suez Canal; we were about to take swift action at that time."

Al-Asali pointed out that the traditional policy of imperialism towards the Arabs has always been built on the basis of "deception, cunning, and malice." He said that the aggression against Egypt is "a desperate, suicidal attempt by imperialism to save its ever-shrinking influence in Africa and Asia."

Al-Asali also said that Israel is attempting to obtain more Arab land as "a reward for its collusion with Britain and France in attacking Egypt."

Al-Asali said that the Arabs are by no means isolated in their difficult struggle, and he highly praised the attitude of the Soviet Union in this regard.

Finally, al-Asali talked about some of the measures taken by the Syrian government to mobilize all the strength of the country and consolidate the internal front.

Xinhua News Agency, November 20th dispatch from Damascus: The Syrian parliament unanimously expressed its support on the evening of November 19 for Prime Minister al-Asali's policy of fully supporting Egypt and opposing the aggression of Britain, France, and Israel.

Xinhua News Agency, November 20th dispatch from TASS, Damascus, November 19th: The Syrian cabinet has decided to allocate 1.5 million Syrian pounds to aid the residents of Port Said.

    叙利亚决心同埃及反抗侵略到底
    拨款一百五十万叙镑援助塞得港居民
    新华社20日讯　大马士革消息：叙利亚总理阿萨利17日对议会说，叙利亚决心“同埃及站在一起，反抗（英、法和以色列）三国的侵略到底”。
    他还说：“除非它们退到它们开始作为侵略者来进攻埃及的阵地，我们是不会放心的。”
    阿萨利警告英国、法国和以色列，要它们执行联合国大会通过的关于英法以三国军队应当撤出埃及的决议。他说，阿拉伯国家决心执行阿拉伯国家首脑会议所通过的决议，其中包括关于对埃及的任何侵略将被认为是针对所有阿拉伯国家的侵略。
    阿萨利在回顾局势的发展的时候说，从英、法、以对埃及发动的侵略刚一开头，“我们跟整个世界一样，就识破了这两个大国和它们的伙伴以色列的恶毒的企图。因此，我们毫不动摇地选定了自己的道路。我们肯定，英、法、以三国今天以苏伊士运河为借口来建立自己的统治，反对阿拉伯国家的民族解放运动和分裂阿拉伯的队伍，而明天就会找到另外的借口”。
    阿萨利指出，埃及的斗争就是“我们的斗争”，“侵略埃及就是对所有阿拉伯人生存的侵犯”。他对议会说：“在危险刚一冒头的时候，我们就毫不犹豫地站在埃及一边。”“我们动员了我们所有的物质和道义力量来帮助埃及。我们曾接到联合司令部让我们等候和观察局势发展的指示，因为战场已经从西奈转移到对付侵略的英法军队要在苏伊士运河登陆的行动方面去；当时我们正要开始采取迅速的行动。”
    阿萨利指出，帝国主义对阿拉伯人的传统政策向来是建筑在“欺骗、狡猾和恶毒”的基础上的。他说，对埃及的侵略是“帝国主义打算挽救自己在非洲和亚洲愈来愈小的影响的一种类似自杀的绝望企图”。
    阿萨利还说，以色列企图获得更多的阿拉伯土地，作为“它同英法两国共谋进攻埃及的一种报酬”。
    阿萨利说，阿拉伯人在自己艰难的斗争中决不是孤立的，他在这方面对于苏联的态度作了高度的评价。
    阿萨利在最后谈了叙利亚政府在动员全国一切力量和巩固内部阵线方面所采取的某些措施。
    据新华社20日讯　大马士革消息：叙利亚议会在11月19日晚上一致表示支持阿萨利总理提出的全力支持埃及和反对英、法、以三国侵略的政策。
    新华社20日讯　塔斯社大马士革19日讯：叙利亚内阁决定拨款一百五十万叙镑援助塞得港居民。
