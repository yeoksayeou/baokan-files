Xinhua News Agency, 19th: The Beijing First Smelting Production Cooperative, without using any ore, provides the state with 100 tons of pig iron and 4 tons of copper every month.

In the courtyard of this cooperative, piles of iron powder and copper powder mixed with dirt are stacked, which are the raw materials for their copper and iron production. These scrap copper and broken iron are mostly purchased from some mechanical factories and streets, and a small number are picked up from garbage. First, a magnet is used to extract the iron powder from the garbage as a raw material for smelting recycled iron, and then it is washed and sifted in water to remove impurities and dirt from the garbage, and copper powder is taken out and smelted into copper ingots and copper.

Now, the copper and iron smelted by this cooperative, in addition to leaving a small amount for the cooperative to cast stoves and other daily ironware, are all supplied to the Beijing Metal Production Cooperative and some state-owned factories.

    熔铁合作社
    据新华社19日讯　北京第一熔炼生产合作社不用任何矿石，每月给国家一百吨生铁和四吨铜。
    在这个合作社的院子里，堆满混和着泥土的铁末子、铜末子，这些就是他们生产铜铁的原料。这些碎铜烂铁，大部分是从一些机械工厂和街头巷尾收购来的，少数是从垃圾中拣出来的。先用吸铁石把垃圾中的铁末吸出，作为熔炼再生铁的原料，然后在水中用细筛摇摆洗涤，把垃圾中的杂质和泥土洗去，取出铜末，熔成铜锭和铜。
    现在，这个合作社熔炼的铜铁，除留下少数给社内铸制火炉等日用铁器外，全部供给北京市金属生产合作社和一些国营工厂。
