    After Subscribing to Newspapers and Periodicals at One's Own Expense
    Editor's Note: Since individuals have been subscribing to newspapers and periodicals at their own expense, some readers have written to reflect new problems encountered in the subscription work; some readers have also written to introduce some experiences in carrying out self-funded newspaper subscriptions. Here, we publish excerpts from several readers' letters for the reference of postal and telecommunications departments and newspaper and periodical promotion stations.
    The Fee Collection Should Be Coordinated with Payday
    The Dezhou Post Office in Shandong Province stipulates that subscriptions for periodicals must be made before the 10th of each month, and for newspapers before the 12th, otherwise they will not be available. However, various government offices, enterprises, and factories in Dezhou issue wages after the 15th of each month. Many comrades do not have money to subscribe to newspapers and periodicals within the stipulated dates, and by the time they receive their wages, the post office has already stopped accepting subscriptions. It is suggested that the post office determine the deadline for newspaper and periodical subscriptions based on the actual situation, and it would be best to take the payday into consideration.　Wang Junhai
    This Fee Collection Method is Very Convenient
    Since the Beijing Industrial Design Institute implemented self-funded newspaper and periodical subscriptions, the number of newspapers subscribed to by individuals has increased from three to three hundred and four. However, the newspaper and periodical promotion station encountered two new problems in the subscription process. One is the contradiction between the time the post office collects fees and the time wages are paid. The post office collects fees at the end of the month, while wages are paid on the 6th of the following month. Some readers cannot afford to subscribe because they do not have enough money at hand. The other problem is the cumbersome fee collection procedure. Newspaper and periodical promoters have to collect fees from hundreds of readers one by one, which is not only time-consuming and laborious but also inconvenient for both parties; moreover, it is easy to make mistakes, causing promoters to lose money. Therefore, when collecting subscriptions for the November newspapers, the newspaper and periodical promotion station obtained administrative approval to have the finance department deduct the newspaper fees during payday. At the same time, they coordinated with the post office so that the finance department could pay the newspaper fees to the post office uniformly after the 6th of the following month when wages were paid. This simplified many procedures, reduced many unnecessary troubles, and made it particularly convenient for readers. As a result, the number of newspapers subscribed to at one's own expense in November at the Beijing Industrial Design Institute increased by seventy-six compared to the previous month.　Han

    Subscribing Together Reduces the Burden
    When the Quzhou County Cotton, Hemp, and Textile Company in Zhejiang Province first implemented self-funded newspaper and periodical subscriptions, very few newspapers and periodicals were subscribed to by individuals, with only three magazines. The reason was not that everyone did not need newspapers and periodicals, but that the income of ordinary comrades was not high, and paying a sum of money for newspaper and periodical fees all at once felt like a heavy burden.
    After the newspaper and periodical promotion station was established, it focused on this situation and organized employees with poorer economic conditions to subscribe in groups of two or three, making the burden on each person very light. At the same time, everyone could exchange newspapers and periodicals to read, and the variety of newspapers and periodicals they could see also increased. After such organization, everyone subscribed to a total of twenty-six different newspapers and periodicals, an increase of nearly eight times compared to before.

      It is Best to Subscribe to Sunday Newspapers Separately
    After the implementation of self-funded newspaper and periodical subscriptions, a new problem has arisen: in the past, the public unit subscribed to newspapers, and people could read newspapers in the office on weekdays. On holidays, they would subscribe to a Sunday newspaper at home. Now, if the newspaper is subscribed to at the office, there is no newspaper to read at home on Sundays, and subscribing to another Sunday newspaper would not only increase the burden but also cause waste. If the newspaper is subscribed to at home, there is no newspaper to read at the office during the day.
    It is suggested that the post office divide subscribers into two types: weekday subscribers (subscribing for twenty-six days a month) and Sunday subscribers. This would be very convenient for readers.　Yang Yi

### 自费订阅报刊以后

    自费订阅报刊以后
    编者按　自从个人阅读的报刊实行自费订阅以来，有的读者来信反映，在订阅工作中遇到了一些新问题；有的读者也来信介绍了一些开展自费订报工作的经验。这里我们摘要发表几封读者来信，供邮电部门和报刊推广站参考。
    收报费要配合发薪时间
    山东德州市邮局规定刊物必须在每月10日前、报纸在12日前订阅，过期就订不到了。但德州市各机关、企业、工厂都是在每月15日以后发工资。很多同志在规定日期内没有钱订报刊，等到发薪后邮局又截止收订了。建议邮局根据实际情况确定报刊订阅截止日期，最好能照顾一下发薪日期。　王俊海
    这个收费办法很方便
    北京工业设计院自从实行自费订阅报刊以来，个人订阅的报纸由三份增加到了三百零四份。但报刊推广站在收订过程中遇到了两个新问题，一个是邮局收取报费时间和发薪时间的矛盾，邮局在月底收费，而工资须在下月六日发放，有些读者因钱不凑手，想订也不可能；另一个问题是收费手续的麻烦，报刊推广员向几百个读者一个一个地去收费，不仅费时费事，双方都不方便；而且还易出差错，使推广员赔钱。因此，报刊推广站在收订11月份的报纸时，征得行政上的同意，改由财务科在发薪时代扣报费。同时又和邮局联系好，到下月六日发薪后，由财务科统一将报费付给邮局。这就简化了很多手续，减少了许多不必要的麻烦，使读者格外方便。因此，北京工业设计院11月份自费订阅的报纸较上月又增加了七十六份。　韩
    合伙订报减轻负担
    浙江衢县花纱布公司在刚实行报刊自费订阅时，个人订阅的报刊很少，只有三份杂志。原因并不在于大家不需要报刊，而是因为一般同志收入不多，一下子付出一笔报刊费，感到负担重。
    报刊推广站成立以后，就针对这一情况，组织经济条件较差的职工两人或三人合订，每人的负担很轻，同时，大家还可交换报刊阅读，能看到报刊的种类也很多。经过这样组织后，大家共选订了各种报刊二十六份，较前增加了近八倍。
                          邵盛浩
      星期日报纸最好分订
    实行自费订阅报刊后，发生了个新问题：过去公家订了报，平时在机关有报看，例假日则在家另订一份星期日报纸；现在如把报纸订在机关里，星期日在家就无报看，如再订一份星期日报，不仅增加负担，又造成浪费。如订在家里，白天在机关又无报看。
    建议邮局把订户分为工作日订户（每月订二十六天）和星期日订户两种，这就会使读者感到很大方便。　杨易
