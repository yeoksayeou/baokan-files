The Social Significance of the Chinese Revolution
Sun Yat-sen

Translator's note: This article was published by Mr. Sun Yat-sen in the Belgian "Le Peuple" on July 11, 1912. The Russian Bolshevik newspaper "?瓦明星" in its seventeenth issue reprinted it and also published Lenin's article "Democracy and Populism in China." Thanks to the assistance of the Soviet Union, we have obtained a photograph of this issue of the newspaper (see the picture on the right). We have now translated this article into Chinese from the Russian version. However, since Mr. Sun Yat-sen's original Chinese manuscript is no longer available, this translation will inevitably have many discrepancies from the original. Please point them out.

China has declared the establishment of a republic. Although I have resigned from the post of Provisional President of the Republic of China, this does not mean that I will not serve the republic. My resignation is due to the fact that I have more important matters to attend to.

China was ruled by the Qing Dynasty for 270 years. During this period, countless patriots attempted to restore China. One of them was the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom revolution fifty years ago, but this was purely a racial revolution of the Han people against the Manchus. Even if this revolution had been successful, the country would still have been under the rule of an autocratic government; such a result could not be called a success.

A few years ago, a small group of us gathered in Japan and founded the Tongmenghui (Chinese United League).

At that time, we adopted three major principles: Nationalism, Democracy, and People's Livelihood.

The first two principles have been realized with the abdication of the Qing court, and now we should carry out an economic revolution. Although this issue is the focus of national debate, most Chinese people may not fully understand the meaning of these words, thinking that the purpose of revitalizing China is to turn China into a country that can compete with Western countries.

Our ambition is not limited to this. No country is richer than Britain and the United States today, or more civilized than France. England is a constitutional monarchy, and France and the United States are republics, but the disparity between the rich and the poor in these countries is still very obvious, so the tide of revolution often stirs the people of these countries. If a social revolution is not carried out, most people will still not be able to enjoy the happiness and well-being of life. The so-called happiness is only enjoyed by a few capitalists.

The working masses are still in dire poverty, and of course, they cannot be emotionally at ease. Racial revolutions and political revolutions are not difficult, but social revolutions are very difficult. Only people engaged in great undertakings can realize social revolution.

Some people object to me, saying, "Your revolution has been going smoothly so far, you should be satisfied, and be good at waiting. Why are you in a hurry to do things that even the wealthy and scientifically advanced Britain and the United States dare not touch?"

This is an unwise policy. Because Britain and the United States have a high degree of civilization and developed industry, it is indeed difficult to realize social revolution there.

Our China has not yet developed to that point, so social revolution is relatively easy for us. We have the possibility to prevent the attack of the capitalist system. In capitalist countries, vested interests are held tightly, and it is difficult to break these interests. In China, there are neither capitalists nor vested interests, so it is relatively easy to carry out this revolution.

People often ask me, "Does such a revolution require the use of force?" My answer is "It is needed in Britain and the United States, but not in China." The great strike of British coal miners proves my judgment is correct. But the great strike is far from a revolution, it merely expresses the people's desire to control social wealth and resources. Obviously, only force can achieve this goal.

Realizing a social revolution may be very difficult, but the time when the revolution becomes a reality is approaching. We do not want to speculate on how many drastic measures and dangers the realization of the revolution will bring to the country.

If we do not consider how to prevent the breeding and rise of capitalism in the near future from the day the Republic of China exists, then what awaits us is a new autocratic tyranny that is a hundred times more cruel than the Qing Dynasty's autocratic tyranny. To get rid of this new tyranny, we must use bloody means. What a bleak future!

There is one situation that requires our special attention. As soon as the new government is established, it must change all the legal basis of real estate (tous lestitres). This measure is a necessary means of revolution. Progress requires it. Previously, land owners paid land price taxes, divided into three grades: superior, medium, and inferior. In the future, the tax must be commensurate with the land price, because the quality of the land is much greater than the difference expressed by the above three grades. I know exactly how big the difference is between the price of land in Nanjing and the land on the Shanghai Bund, but under the old system, we could never set a fair and reasonable price. It would be more reasonable to implement a method of taxing less on barren land and more on superior land. Those who own superior land are rich people, and it is not unfair to tax them more. The land with the lowest price is the property of poor people in remote rural areas, and they should only be charged the lightest tax. It is very unreasonable that the Bund land and farms currently pay the same tax. To eliminate this unreasonableness, the tax should be commensurate with the land price. The land price of Shanghai real estate has increased ten thousand times in the past century. China is on the eve of large-scale industrial development, and commerce will also develop on a large scale. In fifty years, we will have many Shanghais. To be able to foresee the future, we must be far-sighted and make decisions now so that the appreciation of real estate value (la plus-value) becomes the property of the people who create this appreciation, rather than the property of individual capitalists who are fortunate enough to become private land owners.

    中国革命的社会意义
    孙中山
    译者按：这篇文章是孙中山先生在1912年7月11日的比利时“人民报”（Le peuple）上发表的。俄国布尔塞维克机关报“?瓦明星”第十七期加以转载，它同时发表了列宁的文章“中国的民主主义和民粹主义”。由于苏联方面的帮助，我们得到了这一期报纸的照片（见右图），现在按照俄文再把这篇文章译成中文。但是，因为孙中山先生的中文原稿已不可得，这篇译文与原文不免有许多出入，请大家指正。
    中国宣告成立共和国。我虽然辞去了中华民国临时大总统的职务，但这绝不是说，我将不为共和国效劳。我之辞职，实因有更为重大之事务要我操心。
    中国受清朝统治二百七十年，在这期间，曾有无数志士，试图恢复中华。其一便是五十年前的太平天国革命，但此举纯为汉族反对满洲人的种族革命。即令这次革命取得了胜利，国家仍然处于专制政府统治之下；则此种结果亦不能称之为成功。
    几年前，我们一批人数不多的朋友们在日本会集，创立了中国同盟会。
    那时我们采取了三大主义：民族、民权、民生。
    前两个主义因清廷退位而付之实现，现在我们应该实行经济革命。这个问题虽是目前全国争论的焦点。但大多数中国人民对这几个字的意义恐还不甚了然，以为振兴中国的目的就在于把中国变成足以和西方各国并驾齐驱的国家。
    我们的志向不在于此。现今没有那一个国家比英美更为富足，比法兰西更为文明的了。英吉利是君主立宪政体，法兰西和美利坚以共和立国，但这些国家国内贫富间的悬殊仍极明显，所以革命的思潮常激动着这些国家的国民。如果不进行社会革命，则大多数人依然得不到生活的快乐和幸福。现在所谓幸福只是少数几个资本家才能享受的。
    劳工群众依旧是赤贫，当然在情绪上不可能是安然的。种族革命和政权革命不难，但社会革命则大不易。只有从事伟大事业的人民才能实现社会革命。
    有人反对我说：“你们的革命到现在为止进行得很顺利，该满足了，要善于等待，在财力充沛科学发达的英美至今都不敢问津的事情，为什么你要赶忙呢？”
    这是不明智的政策。因为英国和美国有高度的文明和发达的工业，要在那里实现社会革命确是难事。
    我们的中国还没有发展到那种地步，故社会革命对我们来说就比较容易。我们有可能预防资本主义制度的进攻，在资本主义国家里对既得利益是紧抱不放的，要打破这种利益是困难的。在中国既无资本家，也没有既得利益，因而进行这种革命就比较容易。
    有人常问我：“这样的革命需要动用武力吗？”我的回答是“在英美是需要的，在中国来说则不需要。”英国煤矿工人的大罢工证明我的论断是正确的。但大罢工远不是革命，它仅仅是表现了人民想掌握社会财富资源的一种愿望而已，显然，只有用武力才能达到这一目的。
    实现社会革命可能是很困难的，但革命成为事实的时候是迫近了。我们并不想揣测革命的实现会对国家带来多少激烈的手段和危险。
    如果我们从中华民国存在之日起就不去考虑如何防止资本主义在最近将来的孳生崛兴，那么等待我们的就是比清朝专制暴政还要酷烈百倍的新专制暴政，要挣脱这种新的暴政就必须用流血手段。那是何等暗淡的前途！
    有一个情况需要我们加以特别注意。新政府一成立，就必须改变不动产的全部法权根据（tous lestitres）。这一措施是革命的必要手段。进步要求这样做。以前，土地所有者缴地价税，分成三等：优等地、中等地和劣等地。将来必须使税和地价相称，因为土地的质量比上述三种等级所表现的差别要大得多。我知道南京的地产与上海外滩的地产价格的差别究竟有多大，但在旧制度下我们决不能规定公平合理的价格。如果对地价税实行贫瘠土地少纳税、优等土地多纳税的办法，则更为合理。拥有优等土地的都是有钱人，课之以较高的税毫无不公正之处。价格最低的土地为穷乡僻壤贫民阶层的财产，只应向他们收最轻的税。目前外滩的土地和农场缴纳同样的税，这很不合理。要消除这种不合理现象，应该使税和地价相称。上海房产地价百年来增加了一万倍。中国处在大规模的工业发展的前夜，商业也将大规模地发展起来，再过五十年我们将有许多上海。要能预见未来，我们必须是有远见的人，而且要现在就作出决定，使地产价值（la plus-value）的增殖额，成为创造这一价值增殖额的人民的财产，而不是成为那些侥幸成为土地私有者的个别资本家的财产。
