To a Girl in Hungary
    Lou Shiyi

    The message you wrote to me in beautiful Hungarian on the back of a pink invitation card at the farewell banquet in Shenyang before you returned to your country has now been found and placed before me. Although four full years have passed, this message is still so fresh. I seem to see again your big, happy eyes, I seem to see again your red, smiling face. Although I don't understand a word of your language, I understand the joyful smile on your face. At that time, you shook my hand warmly and said through a translator: "See you in Budapest!" But today's Budapest... Thinking of you, my heart trembles. In the bleeding streets and burning houses, girl, how can I imagine your safety? I hear the young mothers of Hungary, tightly embracing their young children under the beastly counter-revolutionaries' butcher knives, uttering cries of panic that can be heard tens of thousands of miles away. I see the heroic soldiers of the Public Security Forces, in the last moments of their bitter struggle, being thrown into the bonfires lit by the mobs, sacrificing their precious lives to defend socialism. Spies from American intelligence agencies, exiled elements, and fascist terrorists, the Horthys, have scurried back like rabid dogs and poisonous snakes, trying to replant hunger and death in this land. Girl, I know you will absolutely not allow it. You must stand like a steel statue, standing tall in front of the blood-stained fortress, fighting for survival and happiness. Brotherly countries and the people of the world are with you. You are not alone, you must be victorious, and we must, in beautiful, peaceful, and free Budapest, see you again!
                        November, 1956.
