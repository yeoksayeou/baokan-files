Outstanding Soviet Circus Art
	Wang Dizi

	The performances of the Soviet circus, like the other Soviet art troupes we have seen in the past, are rich in distinctive national characteristics. Like the meritorious actor Serbin’s "Dancing on a Steel Wire," the audience saw her very skillfully and confidently mastering the steel wire beneath her feet. With graceful music, she danced back and forth on the wire. She danced Russian dances, and then Ukrainian and Kazakh dances. Sometimes the audience could not help but worry about the rapid steps in these dances, and the bouncing and jumping on the steel wire; but she danced so naturally and lovely, perfectly expressing the optimistic and cheerful emotions characteristic of these national people. From Rogalski's equestrian performance, it can also be seen that he trained those horses to follow the rhythm of the Moldavian music played by his flute or the band, and dance the steps of this national dance.

	The highly developed Soviet circus art shows the bravery, strength, wisdom, and creativity of the Soviet people. Whether it is Nemchinskaya’s beautiful gymnastics on the trapeze hanging in the air, Chernega and Razumov’s "aerial acrobatics," or the meritorious actor Mirayev’s ladder skills, or the meritorious actor Hertz’s weightlifting performance, all fully express this characteristic. Without a courageous spirit and persistent exercise, without mastering scientific knowledge, without applying scientific principles, or without mechanical equipment, it would be impossible to create these exciting programs. The meritorious actor Luban's "Playing with Lions and Bears" also shows the new achievements of Soviet circus art in animal training. He does not rely solely on power to subdue them like ordinary animal trainers, holding a pistol in one hand and an electric whip in the other; instead, he uses Pavlov's biological conditioned reflex, and can tame lions and bears to obey his will by simply waving a flowered handkerchief in his hand. The scene where the mischievous big bear always wants to pull him into a dance is a wonderful expression of his close relationship with these lions and bears.

	The clown is also a role in our folk opera and acrobatics art that is welcomed by the broad masses of the audience. With excellent traditions, Russian clown performances were often the most powerful weapon to satirize the old regime before the October Revolution. Today, Soviet clowns inherit the excellent traditions of the past and also satirize the backward phenomena that remain in society. This time, the meritorious actor Vyatkin in the Soviet circus troupe, due to language limitations, could not fully display his talents; however, the audience can still see his humor, wit, and multifaceted talents from his interlude performances. He always looks for opportunities to make contact with the audience. He attracts the audience every moment and brings laughter to the audience.

	The performances of the Soviet circus make us clearly see the organic and close cooperation of all aspects of this comprehensive art. The beautiful pictures created by the actors' skillful and superb techniques; the diverse styles and moods of music specially created for various programs; the national characteristics designed by artists, and the various beautiful, bright, and perfect costumes that reveal the human physique, etc., make the entire performance leave an unforgettable impression.

    杰出的苏联马戏艺术
    王地子
    苏联马戏团的演出，和我们过去看到的其他苏联艺术团一样，富有鲜明的民族色彩。像功勋演员塞尔比那的“在钢丝上跳舞”，观众看到她非常熟练而自信地驾驭着她脚底下的钢丝，随着优美的音乐，她来回地在钢丝上舞起来；她跳完了俄罗斯舞，又跳着乌克兰舞、哈萨克舞。观众有时不免要为这些舞蹈中的急速步子，和在钢丝上的弹、跳而担心；但是，她舞得那么自然、可爱，完美地表现了这些民族人民特有的乐观、明朗的情绪。从罗加尔斯基的马术表演中，也能看出他把那几匹马训练得能够跟随着他的牧笛或乐队吹奏的莫尔达维亚音乐的节奏，跳起这个民族舞蹈的步伐。
    高度发展的苏联马戏艺术显示了苏联人民的勇敢、健壮、智慧和创造性。不论是涅姆钦斯卡娅在空中悬挂着的吊杆上的健美的体操、切尔涅加和拉祖莫夫两人的“空中飞人”，还是功勋演员米拉耶夫的梯技，或是功勋演员赫尔茨的举重表演，都充分地表现了这一特点。没有勇敢的精神和坚持不懈的锻炼、不掌握科学知识、不运用科学原理或是没有机械设备，是不能创造出这些激动人心的节目的。功勋演员鲁班的“耍狮、熊”，也显出了苏联马戏艺术在兽类训练上的新成就。他不像一般的驯兽者那样，一手举着手枪、一手拿着电鞭，光依靠威力镇服它们；而是运用了巴夫洛夫生物学的条件反射作用，只要挥动着手中的一条花手帕，就能把狮、熊驯服得顺从他的意志活动。那只顽皮的大狗熊总是想拉着他跳舞的情景，是多么有趣地表现了他和这些狮、熊的亲密关系。
    丑角也是我国民间戏曲和杂技艺术中受到广大观众欢迎的角色。有着优秀传统的俄罗斯的丑角表演，在十月革命前，常常是讽刺旧政权最有力的武器。今天，苏联的丑角继承了过去的优良传统，对社会上残存的落后现象也进行讽刺。这一次苏联马戏团中的功勋演员维亚特金，由于语言的限制，不能充分地发挥他的特长；但是，观众仍能从他的幕间穿插表演中，看到他的幽默、风趣和多方面的才能。他总是找寻机会和观众发生接触，他一刻不放松地吸引住观众，给观众带来欢笑。
    苏联马戏团的演出，使我们明确地看到这一综合艺术各方面有机的紧密配合。演员们的娴熟、高超的技巧所塑造的优美画面；专门为各种节目所创作的多样风格和情调的音乐；美术家所设计的富有民族特色的，多种美丽、明快、完美地显露了人的健美体格的服饰等等，使得整个演出给人留下了难忘的印象。
