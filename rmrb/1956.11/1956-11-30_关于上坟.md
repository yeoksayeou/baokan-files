    About Visiting Graves
    Han Chuan
    I don't know much about the situation in other places, but in Hebei Province, some county and district workers definitely try to avoid going home during "Qingming" or the old lunar "October 1st". The reason is: if they don't visit ancestral graves when they go home, the elderly will gossip behind their backs, saying "this kid has become a cadre and doesn't want his ancestors anymore"; if they do visit graves, township and commune cadres and young activists will criticize them for being "feudal, superstitious, and backward." It is truly:
    Without standard right or wrong, cadres face difficulties on both sides.
    There is a Party Secretary of a Hebei Provincial Committee, who for the past few years has always taken advantage of the Spring Festival holiday to go home, carrying an iron shovel to his ancestral grave. If he finds that a grave has collapsed or has a hole, he fills it with a few shovels of dirt. The villagers say: "I only see this one Communist Party member who hasn't forgotten his ancestors." But county and district cadres write reports to their superiors, expressing opinions, saying that it "reflects poorly." Who exactly "reflected" what? Where are the "bad" things that were "reflected"? I am afraid that the comrades who wrote the reports have not made a good analysis and study of the problem. If this Party Secretary, like the "fourth-rank officials" of the past, returned home in glory, visiting ancestral graves with great fanfare, erecting sheds and memorial arches at the ancestral graves, distributing porridge and alms, acting like a vestige of feudalism, then he should be severely criticized; or if he went solely to visit graves, sparing no effort to travel thousands of miles, even neglecting his work, he should also be criticized. However, this is not the case. He neither hindered his work nor mobilized laborers; he simply used his own hands to add a few shovels of soil to his ancestral grave, which is purely a matter of personal life. While it is not necessary to commend him, there seems to be no theoretical basis for excessively criticizing him.
    To oppose feudalism, it is not necessary to reject all ancestors wholesale. However, there is indeed an atmosphere hovering in the countryside at present: visiting graves and burning paper is "old feudalism." But the peasants do not think so. They see the higher authorities commemorate Mr. Sun Yat-sen, mourn Comrade Ren Bishi, and sweep the tomb of the Yellow Emperor on "National Tomb Sweeping Day"; they feel that visiting graves is also a way for them to express a little remembrance of their ancestors, and there is nothing to oppose.
    Visiting graves and burning paper are forms of commemoration for peasants to remember their ancestors, just as holding memorial meetings and memorial services are also forms of commemoration. Of course, burning paper to send money to "ghosts" has superstitious overtones, and superstition should be gradually eliminated; but this cannot be achieved by means of "criticism" or "prohibition" and other coercive measures. As a form of commemoration, visiting graves is entirely a matter within the scope of the peasants' own private lives. If there are better forms, they may well accept them. Irony, ridicule, or indiscriminate restrictions and interference do nothing to change customs.

    关于上坟
    韩川
    别的地方的情况我不大知道，在河北省，确有一部分县、区工作人员，在“清明”或旧历“十月一”极力避免回家。原因是：回家不上坟，老年人会在背后议论，说“这小子当了干部，不要祖宗了”；上坟，乡、社干部和青年积极分子又会批评他“封建、迷信、落后”。正是：
    是非无标准，干部两头难。
    河北省有一位地委书记，这几年每逢春节，他总是借假期回一趟家，扛一张铁锨到祖坟上去，发现那一座坟塌陷，或者有窟窿，就垫上几铁锨土。乡亲们说：“只看见这么一个共产党员，还没有忘记他的祖宗。”但县、区干部却向上面写报告，提意见，说是“反映不好”。究竟是谁“反映”了些什么？“反映”的那些地方“不好”呢？恐怕写报告的同志对问题也没有加以很好的分析研究。如果这位地委书记，也跟从前的“四品官”一样，衣锦还乡，大摇大摆地上坟祭祖，在祖坟上搭席棚，立牌坊，施粥舍饭，俨然封建余孽，倒是应该狠狠地反一通；或者专为上坟，不惜往返数千里，甚至置工作于不顾，也应该加以批评。然而，并不如此。他既没有妨害工作，也没有动员民工，只是自己动手为自己的祖坟垫几铁锨土，纯属私人生活方面的事，固然不必表彰，但似乎也没有什么理论根据必须加以过分的责难。
    反封建，不一定要一古脑儿把祖宗全反掉。但是，目前农村上空确实飘荡着这样一种空气：上坟、烧纸，就是“老封建”。不过农民却不这样想。他们看到上级纪念孙中山先生，追悼任弼时同志“民族扫墓节”为轩辕黄帝扫墓；他们觉得上坟也是自己对自己祖先的一点纪念表示，没有什么应该反对的。
    上坟、烧纸，是农民纪念自己祖先的一种形式，如同开纪念会、追悼会等也是一种纪念形式一样。当然，烧纸给“鬼”送钱，带有迷信色彩，迷信应该逐步破除；但这不是用“批评”或“不准”等等带有强制意味的手段所能奏效的。作为一种纪念形式看，上坟完全是农民自己私人生活范围以内的事情。有更好的形式，他们不见得不接受。讽刺、嘲笑，或者滥加限制和干涉，都是无补于移风易俗的。
