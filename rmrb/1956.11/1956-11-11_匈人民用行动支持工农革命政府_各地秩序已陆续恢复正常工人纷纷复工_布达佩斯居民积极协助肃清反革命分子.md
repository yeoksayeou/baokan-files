Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 10th - The Czechoslovak News Agency, based on broadcasts from Budapest Radio, reported on the situation in the Hungarian capital and other regions, stating: Citizens of Budapest, the Hungarian capital, welcome the new measures taken by the Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government on the 9th to strengthen the state's power and restore national order. All the government's orders are trusted by all honest citizens. The friendly behavior of Soviet soldiers towards the residents further enhances this trust. In some areas of the fifth district of Budapest, Soviet soldiers share their food with the residents.

With the support of the working people, many enterprises in Budapest have resumed work. The organizations of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party in many districts have also resumed their activities. In the first district, one hundred and fifty activists participated in the work of the party organization. The food supply in this district is well-organized, and there is no longer a need to queue to buy food. In the third district, the gas factory workers are working selflessly to ensure that the factory's operations do not stop.

In the fourth district, residents expressed dissatisfaction with the news that the factories in the district had not resumed work. The situation in the fifth and seventh districts is very calm, and residents here have established housing patrol teams to help the government maintain order. The bakery in the twelfth district is working day and night to ensure that bread is supplied to residents in a timely manner. In the thirteenth district, thanks to the efforts of the temporary workers' committee, the work of the automobile repair shop in this district has not stopped. Workers' patrols also protected a steel products factory, repelled attacks by remaining counter-revolutionary elements, and restored order to the factory.

However, the remaining counter-revolutionary elements who have not laid down their weapons are still provoking battles in Budapest from time to time. They and the criminals who were released from prison during the rebellion are still looting and burning shops, factories, and public buildings in some districts. The residents of the capital actively participate in the work of eliminating counter-revolutionary elements. With the assistance of the public security organs, a group of bandits who broke into the "Freedom" department store to loot were eliminated. Another group of armed bandits attempted to attack the winery in the thirteenth district, but they were driven away by the factory's security guards. The bandits looted the Budapest Radio Factory and stole 5,000 radio receivers. Among these "freedom fighters," as they are called by the counter-revolutionary elements and their foreign supporters, some also robbed trains carrying cloth, food, and medicine to the Budapest railway station, as well as several hotels, dozens of department stores, and food stores. On Thursday night, the bandits set fire to the "Royal" Hotel. The fire spread to neighboring houses. When the firefighters went to put out the fire, the bandits even opened fire to stop them.

New news about the restoration of order has come from other regions of Hungary. In Győr, in the northwest, which had become an important center of counter-revolutionary rebellion, peace and order have been restored. The supply of goods to residents is adequate. The supply of gas, electricity, and water to factories and households can be guaranteed. The food industry has resumed production. Farmers are bringing poultry, eggs, and dairy products to the market for sale. Vas County in the west announced that order and tranquility have been completely restored in the area. Enterprises and railway transportation have resumed work, and schools have started classes. Local conferences and party organizations have ensured the normal progress of order and work. In the central city of Kecskemét, residents have established a material supply committee to ensure the smooth procurement of grain from the countryside to supply the city. Most of the shops here have started business. In Békés County in the southeast, many factories have started work, and schools have resumed classes on the 7th. Two trains a day are running on the railway line between Szeged and Békéscsaba. Although some party workers were kidnapped by counter-revolutionary elements, the state committee of the Socialist Workers' Party is still working. The working people of this state emphasized that they will not allow those who create chaos and attempt to restore the old Hungary to do evil again. The working people of the southern city of Szeged have great trust and respect for the activities of the Hungarian Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government. The local organization of the Socialist Workers' Party has been established here. In the textile factory, 98% of the workers have returned to work. The factory that makes records has also resumed work, but the cannery only works a few hours a day because the supply of raw materials, which was interrupted for two weeks, cannot be guaranteed to this day. In some factories, trade unions have held meetings to discuss the full resumption of work and the improvement of living conditions.

    匈人民用行动支持工农革命政府
    各地秩序已陆续恢复正常工人纷纷复工  布达佩斯居民积极协助肃清反革命分子
    新华社布拉格10日电　捷克斯洛伐克通讯社根据布达佩斯电台的广播报道匈牙利首都和各地的情况说：匈牙利首都布达佩斯的市民欢迎工农革命政府在9日采取的关于加强国家力量和恢复国家秩序的新措施。政府的一切命令都得到所有正直的公民的信任。苏联士兵对居民的友好行为更增强了这种信任。在布达佩斯第五区的一些地方，苏联士兵们把他们的食物分给居民们。
    在劳动人民的支持下，布达佩斯的很多企业已经复工。匈牙利社会主义工人党许多区的组织也恢复了它们的活动。在第一区，有一百五十位积极分子参加了党组织的工作。这个区粮食的供应组织得很好，买粮食已经不需要排队。在第三区，煤气工厂工人忘我地进行劳动，以便保证工厂的工作不致停顿。
    在第四区，居民对该区各工厂没有复工的消息表示不满。第五区和第七区的情况很平静，这里的居民成立了房屋巡查队帮助政府维持秩序。第十二区的面包工厂整昼夜都在工作，以便保证及时为居民供应面包。在第十三区，在临时工人委员会的努力下，这个区的汽车修理厂的工作没有停顿。工人巡逻队还保护了一座钢制品工厂，击退了残余反革命分子的袭击，并且使工厂恢复了秩序。
    但是，未放下武器的残余反革命分子仍时时在布达佩斯挑起战斗。他们和在叛乱期间被从监狱释放出来的罪犯还在某些区抢劫和焚烧商店、工厂和公共建筑物。首都的居民积极地参加了肃清反革命分子的工作。在公安机关的协助下，肃清了一批闯进“自由”百货商店进行抢劫的匪徒。另一批武装匪徒企图攻打第十三区的酿酒厂，但是，他们被工厂警卫队赶跑了。匪徒们抢劫了布达佩斯无线电收音机工厂，抢走了五千架无线电收音机。在这些被反革命分子和他们的外国支持者所说的“自由战士”中，还有些人抢劫了载运布匹、食物和药品到布达佩斯火车站去的火车，以及几家旅馆、几十家百货商店和食品商店。星期四晚上，匪徒们在“皇家”旅馆纵火。火势延烧到邻近的房屋。当消防队员前往救火时，匪徒们还开枪阻止。
    从匈牙利其他地区传来了关于秩序正在恢复的新消息。在西北部曾经成为反革命分子叛乱的重要中心的吉厄尔，已经恢复平静和秩序。对居民的物资供应很充分。对工厂和住户的煤气、电和水的供应已能保证。食品工业已经恢复生产。农民正在把家禽、鸡蛋和乳制品等商品带到市场上出售。西部的瓦斯省宣布，当地的秩序和安宁已经完全恢复。各企业和铁路运输已经恢复工作，学校已经开始上课。地方会议和党组织保证了秩序和工作的正常进行。在中部的克奇克梅特市，居民已经建立了物资供应委员会，保证在农村顺利采购粮食供应城市。这里的大多数商店已经开始营业。在东南部的贝凯斯省，许多工厂已经开工，各学校已经在7日复课。在塞格德和贝凯斯萨巴之间的铁路线上，每天已经开行两次列车。尽管有一些党的工作人员被反革命分子绑架走了，但是社会主义工人党州委员会仍然在进行工作。这个州的劳动人民强调说，他们要使那些制造混乱和企图恢复旧匈牙利的人不能再作恶。南部的塞格德市的劳动人民非常信任和尊重匈牙利工农革命政府的活动。这里的社会主义工人党的地方组织已经成立。在纺织厂中，已经有98％的工人复工。制造唱片的工厂也恢复了工作，但是罐头食品厂每天只开工几小时，因为中断了两星期的原料供应到现在为止还不能保证。在有些工厂中，工会已经召开了会议，讨论全面复工和改善生活条件的问题。
