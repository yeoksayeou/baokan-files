    On the Road of Workers Marching Towards Science and Technology
    Diligently Studying Technology
    When Li Yanju first arrived at the machine shop of the Dalian Shipyard, she saw huge machines turning in front of her, making deafening noises that made her dizzy. Gradually, she got used to it, following her master to work every day. She often encountered difficulties, either asking the master or the technicians and veteran workers, and couldn't get much work done in a day. One day, the master asked her to make a flange, but she failed several times, feeling very frustrated. She asked the veteran workers around her and also consulted with technicians and engineers. She realized that without technical theoretical knowledge, just wielding tools and following the master blindly would not improve her skills. She urgently requested to learn technical knowledge. Later, the workshop established a fitter technical class, and she signed up to participate, never being late or leaving early, and never missing class even in wind or rain, studying diligently from early morning to late night.
    When Li Yanju was studying, she didn't recognize foreign letters and couldn't understand drawings. In order to remember the foreign letters, Li Yanju recited them on the way to work and on the way home after work. After a period of hard study, she could not only recognize general symbols, but also write them proficiently. When she was learning the accelerated drawing method for mechanics, she followed her master at work during the day and went home at night to look at the mechanical drawings in the book, using a knife to carve radishes into the shape of machine parts, repeating this several times until it completely matched the requirements of the drawings. In order to better learn technical theoretical knowledge and improve her technical level, she not only borrowed technical books from technical schools and her master, but also bought reference books such as applied geometric drawing methods, tolerances and fits, etc. from Xinhua Bookstore.
    Li Yanju hasn't been studying for long, but due to her active learning and hard work, she has achieved great results. Now she can understand assembly drawings and various machine parts drawings. When she makes wooden pulleys, she can pick up the drawing and know where to put the part, how to install it, and how much clearance there is; when she looks at the metal material symbols on the drawing, she knows whether it is steel, iron, or copper. When she makes door hinge leaves, she can look at the tolerance fit symbols on the drawing and know how to process them, and how the two parts fit together during processing, whether they are tight or loose. Everything on the drawing can be understood very clearly.
    Li Yanju not only studies well herself, but also actively helps others learn technical knowledge. Once, Yu Lianting said that he couldn't calculate the addendum circle diameter and dedendum circle diameter of gears, Li Yanju explained it to him in detail, gave him problems to do, until he got them right. That day, Li Yanju didn't even bother to eat dinner and didn't go home until very late. She thought that suffering a little and getting a little tired was nothing. In order to build a socialist society and live a better life, only when everyone has technical theoretical knowledge can socialist industrialization be realized as soon as possible.　　　　　Peng Lizhao
    Let Everyone Know How to Draw
    Ma Xianzhou is the production team leader of the Model No. 2 Factory of the Shanxi Machine Factory. Before liberation, he worked as a handyman for seven years. After liberation, with the help of veteran masters, he worked during the day and drew according to the drawings at night, and learned the basics of drawing.
    In the foundry department of this factory, 90% of the sand molders could not read drawings, and the product scrap rate was very serious, reaching almost 30% at one point. At that time, the leadership decided to establish an amateur technical class to organize workers to learn to read drawings. Twelve people signed up to participate, and Ma Xianzhou taught them. The study class had no teaching tools, so Ma Xianzhou bought textbooks and drawing instruments for everyone. On Sundays, he also ordered notebooks for everyone, and made triangles and T-squares for teaching during rest periods. In class, Ma Xianzhou first drew on the blackboard, and everyone copied him. He drew quickly, and by the time he finished, everyone had already messed up their drawings. The students all said, "It's too difficult." Ma Xianzhou realized that he was teaching too quickly, and immediately changed his teaching method, first teaching simple cross lines and center lines, then teaching the shape and lines of the drawing, and finally teaching how to draw. When drawing, Ma Xianzhou drew a line on the blackboard, and everyone followed him to draw a line. Slowly, everyone learned. If there were errors in the students' drawings, such as incorrect proportions or dimensions, he would help them correct them, and also brought out the workshop model for everyone to compare. Everyone quickly drew it correctly. Later, he went to the workshop to find out what work was being done, and drew the drawings to be learned on the blackboard during class, and then brought out the model and castings for everyone to see. Everyone said, "This way of teaching is easy to learn and easy to draw, it's really good!"
    After studying, the students in the second class could all understand two or three pages of drawings and draw simple sketches. Shen Guixiu, who originally couldn't understand drawings, can now understand drawings and can also help technicians draw sketches. Zhang Zhenqi's work efficiency has doubled after learning the technology of scraping newspaper dividing bars. Because the workers learned to read drawings and established an intermediate inspection system in production, the scrap rate of casting outline dimensions dropped from an average of 19% in the past to 5%. In the second half of last year, the students made three large castings for furnace door frames, and all 184 pieces of work eliminated the phenomenon of scrapping of outline dimensions. Because the technical class was successful, all workshops in the factory learned this method and established amateur technical classes.

    Improved Technical Level
    When Tu Xiangyuan went to the Shanghai Civil Architectural Design Institute as a trainee, he only had a fourth-grade elementary school education. He couldn't understand the drawings that others drew, and he couldn't understand the calculation books that others calculated, and he couldn't even draw clearly when copying the original. Once, the group leader asked Tu Xiangyuan to draw the detailed drawings of doors and windows of a certain project. There was an original to refer to, only changing the dimensions slightly, but he couldn't finish drawing it for more than a month. As a result, another comrade succeeded in drawing it for him. He thought that the key to improving technology was learning. He made up his mind to work hard to learn scientific and technical knowledge and capture the scientific fortress.
    Tu Xiangyuan had studied junior high school algebra, physics, trigonometry and other courses in a tutoring school, and is now self-studying university physics and calculus courses. He always gets the exercises wrong. He actively found out the main shortcomings in his learning, such as substituting formulas when doing exercises, and always circling in the formulas; before he understood a definition, he read it sentence by sentence, chapter by chapter, so there were more problems. Since then, he paid attention to overcoming these shortcomings, and he made progress in his studies.
    He went to listen to the science and technology lectures held by the Shanghai Science and Technology Popularization Association every time. When he encountered difficult problems, he studied them for one or two days, and he did not relax his learning opportunities even when riding the trolley. Because he was able to study hard, in just one year, he self-studied the mechanics part of university physics, calculus for higher education institutions, applied mechanics, material mechanics, structural mechanics, etc.
    Through this stage of learning, his professional level has been significantly improved. In 1954, he was promoted from trainee to second-level assistant technician. Now, under the guidance of engineers, he is able to independently carry out the technical design and calculation of general two- and three-story mixed structures, as well as the calculation of general complex special structures. He has also greatly improved his speed in drawing and calculation. For example, it only takes him eight to twelve hours to draw a general architectural floor plan.
    Although Tu Xiangyuan has achieved many achievements in his studies, he is not satisfied. Now he has joined the correspondence course of industrial and civil construction at Tongji University.

    在职工向科学技术进军的道路上
    刻苦学习技术
    李艳菊初到大连造船厂机械车间的时候，只见庞大的机器在眼前转来转去，发出轰轰隆隆的响声，震得人头昏眼花。逐渐她就习惯了，每天跟着师傅干活。她常碰到困难，不是东找师傅，就是西找技术员、老工人，一天干不了多少活。有一天老师傅叫她做法兰板，她一连几次都没做好，心中很苦闷。她问了周围的老工人，又去请教技术员和工程师。她懂得了，没有技术理论知识，光拿着工具跟着师傅硬干活，是不会提高的。她迫切要求学习技术知识。后来车间里成立了钳工技术班，她报名参加学习，不迟到，不早退，刮风下雨也不误上课，早起晚睡，刻苦努力地学习。
    李艳菊在学习时，认不得外文字母，无法看懂图纸。李艳菊为了要记得外文字母，在上班的路上背，下班回家的路上背，经过一番苦学以后，不仅能识别一般的符号，而且还能熟练地写出来。她在学习机械工人速成看图法时，白天跟着师傅在工作中学，晚上回到家里一面看着书上的机械图，一面用小刀把萝卜削成机器零件模样，这样一连反复好几次才能完全符合图纸的要求。她为了更好地学习技术理论知识，提高技术水平，不仅向技工学校和师傅借技术书看，而且还到新华书店购买一些应用几何画法、公差与配合等等参考书来看。
    李艳菊学习的时间不长，可是由于积极学习，刻苦努力，获得了很大的成绩。现在她能看懂装配图和各种机器零件图了。她做木滑车时，拿起图纸就知道那个零件往那里放，怎样安装，有多大空隙；一看图纸的金属材料符号，就知道是钢是铁还是铜。她在做门把活页时，一看图纸上的公差配合符号，就知道怎样加工，加工时两个零件是怎么配合，是紧是松，图纸上的一切都能看得非常明白。
    李艳菊不仅自己学习的好，而且还积极帮助别人学好技术知识。有一次于连庭提出不会计算齿轮的齿顶圆直径和齿根圆直径时，李艳菊详细地讲给他听，出题目让他作，直到他做对了为止。这天李艳菊连晚饭也没顾上吃，很晚才回家。她想自己吃一点苦，受一点累没有什么，为了建设社会主义社会，为了过更美好的生活，只有大家都有了技术理论知识，社会主义工业化才能早日实现。　　　　　彭利钊
    让大家都会画图
    马仙洲是山西机器厂模范二厂生产组长。解放前他当过七年的杂工，解放后他在老师傅们的帮助下，白天干活，晚上照着图纸画图，初步学会了画图。
    这个厂铸工部翻砂工人有90％不会看图，产品报废现象很严重，有一个时期几乎达到30％。当时领导方面决定成立业余技术班，组织工人学习看图，有十二人报名参加学习，由马仙洲给他们上课。学习班没有教学工具，马仙洲就代大家买课本和画图仪器，星期天还给大家订本子，休息时做教学用的三角板、丁字尺。上课时，马仙洲先在黑板上画图，大家照着他画。他画得快，等他画完以后，大家早已画乱了。学员都说，太难了。马仙洲知道自己教的太急了，马上改变了教学方法，先教简单的十字线、中心线，再教图的外型、线条，最后教画图。画图的时候，马仙洲在黑板上画一条，大家跟着他画一条，慢慢地就学会了。学员画的图上有错误，比例、尺寸不对，他就帮助改，又把车间的模样拿出来给大家比，大家很快就画对了。以后他先到车间了解做什么活，上课时把要学的图画在黑板上，再搬出模样和铸件给大家看。大家说：这样教又好学又好画，可真好！
    第二班的学员学习后，都能看懂两三面的图纸，绘制简单的草图，原来看不懂图纸的申贵秀，现在能看懂图纸，还能帮助技术员绘制草图。张振祺学了刮报机分筋的技术以后，工作效率提高了两倍。由于工人学会了看图，在生产中又建立了中间检查制度，铸件外型尺寸的报废率由过去的平均19％降到5％。去年下半年学员做的炉门框三种大型铸件，一百八十四件活全部消灭了外型尺寸的报废的现象。由于技术班办的有成绩，全厂各车间都学这个办法，成立了业余技术班。

    提高了技术水平
    屠向远到上海民用建筑设计院做练习生的时候，只有初小四年级文化程度，人家绘的图看不懂，人家算的计算书更看不懂，连照着原样子绘图也绘不清楚。有一次，小组长叫屠向远绘某工程的门窗详图，有原样可参考，只变动一下尺寸，整整绘了一个多月还没绘好，结果是由别的同志代绘成功。他想，提高技术的关键在于学习。他就下了决心，努力学习科学技术知识，攻占科学堡垒。
    屠向远在补习学校里曾学过初中的代数、物理、三角等课程，现在正在自修大学的物理和微积分课程。他老是做不对习题。他就积极找出在学习上的主要缺点，如做习题时去代公式，总是在公式中兜圈子；在还没有弄懂一个定义前，就逐句逐章地看下去，所以问题较多。此后，他注意克服这些缺点，学习上就有了成绩。
    上海科学技术普及协会每次举办的科学技术讲座，他都赶去听讲。碰到困难问题时，他就一天两天地钻研下去，就是在乘电车时，也不放松学习机会。由于他能刻苦努力学习，在短短的一年中，就自修了大学物理的力学部分，高等学校用的微积分学、应用力学、材料力学、结构力学，等等。
    通过这个阶段的学习，他的业务水平有了显著的提高。在1954年他就由练习生提升到二级助理技术员。现在他在工程师的指导下，已经能独立进行一般二、三层楼的混合结构的技术设计和计算以及一般复杂的特殊结构计算了。他在绘图和计算的速度上，也有了很大的提高，如绘一张一般的建筑平面图，只需要八到十二小时。
    屠向远虽然在学习上已取得不少的成绩，但是并没有满足。现在他已经参加了同济大学函授工业与民用建筑专业班学习。
