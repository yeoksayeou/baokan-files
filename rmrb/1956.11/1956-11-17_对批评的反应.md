Reactions to Criticism

    Eliminating Timber Waste
    Letter from the Sichuan Chuanxi Forest Industry Bureau: The People's Daily article on August 18th on page two criticizing our bureau for wasting a large amount of timber is consistent with the facts. In order to fundamentally eliminate the occurrence of timber waste, we have instructed all logging yards to conduct thorough inspections and organize all employees to study and establish a concept of cherishing state property. Our bureau has also adopted the following measures: 1. In accordance with the provisions of the Trial Regulations for Main Felling in State-owned Forests, change the diameter-class selective logging to a clear-cutting method in felling areas to fully utilize forest resources. 2. Carry out re-harvesting in previously selectively logged areas to salvage lost resources. 3. Increase the utilization rate of diseased and rotten wood from 30% to 40%, and conduct processing of diseased and rotten wood with a disease and rot rate of 40%-70% on the mountain site to expand the utilization of forest resources. 4. Process usable diseased materials abandoned in forest areas in the past to fully utilize usable timber. 5. Formulate specific methods for conserving and utilizing timber, put forward requirements for each work section, and clearly delineate a layered periodic inspection responsibility system and reward measures.

    Pay Attention to the Health of Cooperative Members
    Letter from the Xi'an First Handicraft Clothing Production Cooperative: The People's Daily published a reader's letter on September 11th, "Our Rest Time is Too Short," criticizing our cooperative for not caring about the health of its members. Our cooperative immediately conducted a thorough inspection. We feel that some of the situations mentioned in this letter are indeed true; however, some are inconsistent with the facts.

    Our cooperative originally had twenty-five members and expanded to more than one hundred and eighty members at the beginning of this year. Most of the newly joined members used to be individual laborers who worked day and night. After organizing, the cooperative leadership paid attention to the health of the members. In early July, we organized a physical examination for the members. The results showed that two people had severe tuberculosis and needed to stop working; twenty-four people had mild illnesses, and as long as they paid attention to recuperation, they could still work as usual. Our cooperative immediately took some health measures, such as setting up a health kit in the workshop, preparing masks for the members, and establishing a cleaning and hygiene system; so that sick members and healthy members did not work and eat in the same room. Our cooperative also signed a medical contract with the joint clinic so that members could seek medical treatment at any time.

    Regarding the members' rest time, before the operating methods were changed, it was still necessary to work ten hours a day. The time occupied by meetings was indeed relatively large during the period of the great expansion of the cooperativization movement, and sometimes it also occupied production time. However, after the rectification of the cooperative in June, we established a meeting system, holding business meetings every Tuesday and Thursday, and all other temporary meetings did not occupy rest and recreational activity time. The regular holidays of our cooperative are once every two weeks, and generally, we can take holidays on time. It was only at the beginning of this year that because the production volume could not keep up with the needs of the masses, customers often had to wait for more than a month to have a garment made, and the leadership called on the members to postpone their holidays for a month.

    Regarding the suggestions on members' meals and work break exercises, we fully accept them. We must pay attention to the health of the members and continuously improve the members' living and working conditions.

    杜绝木材浪费
    四川川西森林工业局来信：8月18日人民日报二版批评我局浪费大量木材一文，是符合事实的。为了根本杜绝浪费木材的事发生，我们已责成各伐木场认真检查，组织全体职工学习，树立珍惜国家财产观念。我局并采取以下措施：⒈遵照国有林主伐试行规程的规定，改变径级择伐为伐区式皆伐的方式，以充分利用森林资源。⒉对过去择伐区进行复采，以挽救已损失的资源。⒊将病腐利用率由30％提高到40％，并对病腐率40％—70％的病腐木在山场上进行?制，以扩大森林资源的利用。⒋对过去林区内所遗弃的可用病材进行?制，以充分利用可以利用的木材。⒌制定节约利用木材的具体办法，分工段提出要求，并明确划分分层定期检查的责任制度与奖励办法。
    一定重视社员的健康
    西安市手工业第一服装生产合作社来信：9月11日人民日报发表了“我们的休息时间太少了”的读者来信，批评我社不关心社员健康。我社立即进行了深刻的检查。我们觉得这篇来信所谈的情况，有些是确实的；但是也有一些同事实不符。
    我社原有社员二十五人，今年年初发展到一百八十多人。新入社的社员，过去大部分是个体劳动者，干活不分昼夜。组织起来以后，我社领导上就注意了社员的健康问题。在7月初组织社员进行了一次体格检查。结果发现：有两人患严重的肺结核病，需要停止工作；有二十四人病势不重，只要平时注意调养，还能够照常工作。我社立即采取了一些保健措施，如在工房里设置了保健箱，给社员准备了口罩，还订立了清洁卫生制度；使有病的社员和没有病的社员不在同一房间工作和吃饭等。我社还同联合诊所订立了医疗合同，以便社员随时就诊。
    关于社员的休息时间，在操作方法没改变以前，还必需每天工作十小时。会议占用的时间，在合作化运动大展开的期间，确是比较多的，有时候还占用了生产时间。但是在6月份整社以后，我们就订立了会议制度，每星期二、四开业务会议，其它的临时会议一律不占用休息和娱乐活动时间。我社的例假，是每两星期休息一次，一般都能够按时休假，就是在本年年初，因为生产量赶不上群众的需要，顾客来制一件衣服，往往要等上一个多月，领导上就号召社员把假日推迟了一个月。
    关于社员伙食和工间操的建议，我们完全接受，我们一定要重视社员的健康，不断改善社员的生活和工作条件。
