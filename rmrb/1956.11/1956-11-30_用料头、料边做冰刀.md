    Making Ice Skates from Scrap and Edge Materials
    Xinhua News Agency: The local state-owned Heilongjiang Hardware Factory is using high-quality steel scrap and edge materials left over from state-owned factories to manufacture more than 40,000 pairs of high-quality ice-skating racing blades and ice hockey skates.
    The ice skates made from the high-quality steel edge materials and scrap are of excellent quality and can be used for 10,000-meter races. Moreover, the production cost per pair is 4.6 yuan lower than last year. The high-end ice racing blades and ice hockey skates are even more durable, and one sharpening allows them to be used for 15,000 meters of speed skating.
