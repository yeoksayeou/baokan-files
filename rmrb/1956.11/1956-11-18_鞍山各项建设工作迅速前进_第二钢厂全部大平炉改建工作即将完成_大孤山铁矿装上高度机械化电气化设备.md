Anshan’s various construction projects are advancing rapidly.
    The renovation of all open-hearth furnaces at the Second Steel Plant is nearing completion. The Dagushan Iron Mine installed highly mechanized and electrified equipment.

    (By Our Staff) The renovation project of the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Second Steel Plant, after more than two years of intense construction, is now basically completed. The last large open-hearth furnace is nearing completion, and the entire renovation period can be completed two months ahead of the original national plan.
    This steel plant had been severely damaged by the enemy and puppets, and had been shut down for more than ten years. After the renovation began in 1954, the builders, in order to ensure that China's first steel base would reach the 1957 production level in 1956 and produce more high-quality steel to support construction across the country, implemented the policy of more, faster, better, and more economical. The construction units signed mutual assistance contracts, strengthened collaboration and coordination, and accelerated the construction progress. The several large open-hearth furnaces that have been recently completed were all completed two or three days ahead of schedule. The workers who are currently carrying out the bricklaying work on the last open-hearth furnace, in order to support Egypt with practical actions, have proposed to complete the bricklaying task of the twelve-day melting chamber within ten days, so that this open-hearth furnace can be put into production on November 22.
    The renovation project of the Second Steel Plant was designed for China by the Soviet Union. The entire plant has all modern equipment and precision instruments, and the entire production process is mechanized and automated. According to preliminary calculations, the production volume of this steel plant will be twice as large as the production volume of the Second Steel Plant during the puppet Manchukuo period.

    Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, November 17th. Xinhua News Agency reporter Zhang Xiangbo reports: After more than two years of renovation, the output of the Dagushan Iron Mine of Anshan Iron and Steel has greatly increased. The ore produced from January to November 13 this year is more than double the total output of 1954 before the renovation.
    The Dagushan Iron Mine after the renovation has become China's first highly mechanized and electrified open-pit iron mine. The rumbling sound of blasting ore here can be heard in cities and villages twenty kilometers away; each blast breaks down 50,000 to 60,000 tons of ore and silica. The huge electric shovel stretches out its long neck and loads thousands of kilograms of ore into the car box shovel by shovel. Subsequently, the personnel in the electrified locomotive command room and the transportation workers also get busy. The driver drives the electric locomotive, climbs up the mountain along the "zigzag" mountain railway, and quickly transports the ore to the crusher. One cubic meter of ore can be crushed into dozens of pieces in the crusher in just half a minute. The phenomenon that the mining efficiency of this mine was originally unbalanced due to insufficient transportation and crushing capacity has gradually changed.
    The Dagushan Iron Mine has broad room for development. In the future, the mine is expected to be able to reduce by ten meters every year until it is completely mined by the end of the 20th century. In the future, after this mine is completely leveled, its bottom can still be mined for ore hundreds of meters downward.

    鞍山各项建设工作迅速前进
    第二钢厂全部大平炉改建工作即将完成  大孤山铁矿装上高度机械化电气化设备
    本报讯　鞍山钢铁公司第二炼钢厂改建工程，经过二年多的紧张施工，目前这座巨大的炼钢厂已基本完成，最后一座大型平炉接近竣工，全部改建工期可比国家原定计划提前二个月。
    这座炼钢厂由于遭到敌伪的严重破坏，曾停产十多年。1954年动工改建以后，建设者们为保证我国第一个钢铁基地，在1956年达到1957年的生产水平，生产出更多的优质钢支援全国各地建设，他们贯彻了多、快、好、省的方针。各施工单位之间签订了互助合同，加强了协作配合，加速了施工进度。最近建成的几座大型平炉都比原定工期缩短了二、三天竣工。正在进行最后一座平炉砌砖工程的工人，为了以实际行动支援埃及，已提出十天内完成十二天的熔炼室砌砖任务，这样可使这座平炉能够在11月22日投入生产。
    第二炼钢厂改建工程是苏联为我国设计的，全厂有一切近代化设备和精密仪器，整个生产过程都是机械化、自动化的。据初步计算，这座炼钢厂的生产量将比伪满时期第二炼钢厂的生产量大两倍。

    新华社鞍山17日电　新华社记者张向波报道：鞍钢大孤山铁矿经过两年多的改建以后，产量大大提高。在今年1月到11月13日所产的矿石，比改建以前的1954年全年产量还多一倍。
    改建以后的大孤山铁矿，已经是我国第一座高度机械化电气化的露天铁矿。这里爆炸矿石的轰隆声，远在二十公里以外的城市和乡村都可以听到；每爆炸一次，就有五、六万吨矿石和矽石崩裂下来。巨型的电铲伸出长颈，把几千斤重的矿石一斗一斗地装在车箱里。随后，电气化的机车指挥室的人员和运输工人们也跟着忙起来。司机驾驶着电机车，沿着“之”字形的盘山铁路，爬上矿山，迅速地把矿石运到破碎机那里。一立方公尺大的矿石，只需半分钟时间就在破碎机里碎成几十块。这个矿山原来因为运输和破碎能力不足而造成采矿效率不平衡的现象，已经逐渐改变了。
    大孤山铁矿有广阔的发展余地。今后矿山预计每年将能削低十公尺，直到二十世纪末才能采完。将来这个矿山全被削平以后，它的底部还可以向下开采矿石几百公尺。
