Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 1st - Budapest News: After eight days of armed conflict, the Hungarian capital of Budapest had not stabilized by October 31st, and the situation remained chaotic.

　　Soviet troops who entered Budapest at the request of the Hungarian government had withdrawn from Budapest on October 31st, according to the Hungarian government's wishes.

　　On that day, armed conflicts had not ceased in some areas of the city. Armed elements were searching, hunting down, and shooting security force personnel in the city. The security forces, which had supported the government in the past few days, were ordered to be disbanded by the Ministry of Defense on October 29th. The "Hungarian Student Committee," which was established during this unrest, issued a call to armed students on the evening of October 31st, urging them to immediately retake their important strongholds. On this day, one of the targets of the rioters was to seize a party headquarters of the Working People's Party. A "Revolutionary Military Committee" established on the 30th to lead the army had dismissed a number of senior generals, including Lieutenant General L. Toth, First Deputy Minister of Defense and Chief of General Staff.

　　Approximately two thousand people demonstrated in front of the Hungarian Parliament building on Wednesday, demanding the resignation of the Nagy government.

　　As of October 31st, the market in Budapest had not returned to normal. Most industrial enterprises had not started work. Although many pedestrians and cars appeared on the streets, public transportation had not resumed, and railway transportation remained obstructed.

　　Currently, various political forces in the Hungarian capital are gathering and adjusting. Budapest Radio announced on the evening of October 31st that all political prisoners who had been sentenced by the Hungarian government in the past had been released. Cardinal Mindszenty, who was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1949 for treason, has been released. On October 31st, the new interim leading body of the Hungarian Social Democratic Party was elected in the old headquarters in Budapest. The Farmers' Alliance, which was dissolved in 1947, has been restored. The Presidium of the Central Council of Hungarian Trade Unions resigned at a special meeting on the 31st, and the leadership was taken over by an interim executive committee of the "National Federation of Free Hungarian Trade Unions." Budapest Radio declared on the evening of the 30th that its name had been changed to "Free Kossuth Radio." It also announced that "the colleagues of the radio sternly criticize the past actions of Budapest Radio." It is reported that this indicates that Budapest Radio has been controlled by people with different political tendencies from the past editors.

　　Messages from various sources to Prague indicate that the situation in other parts of Hungary remains chaotic and complex. In the northeastern region, enterprises in Borsod Province have not yet resumed work. The organ of the re-established "Smallholders Independent Party," the "Miskolc Daily," was republished in Miskolc from October 31st. The Soviet troops stationed in the city stated that they would not interfere in the affairs of the city's workers.

　　In the east, Debrecen Province is calm.

　　In the south, a "Revolutionary National Committee" has been established in Kaposvár. This committee has gained power in the city and demands that Hungary "immediately withdraw from all military blocs." The commander of the local public security agency has been arrested. In Tomba, the local Soviet troops also stated that they would never interfere in Hungary's internal affairs.

　　The situation in western and northwestern Hungary is even more complex. It is reported that in recent days, the unrest in Győr in the northwest has developed. Demonstrations and counter-demonstrations have taken place there. A "National Committee" established during the riots openly opposes the current government. A "National Committee" of Zala Province has been established in Zalaegerszeg, which agrees with the current government's program. Three political parties were established in this place in one night: the Smallholders, Bourgeois, and Agricultural Laborers Party, the Hungarian Workers' Party, and the National Peasants' Party.

    匈牙利国内局势仍然混乱
    新华社布拉格1日电　布达佩斯消息：匈牙利首都布达佩斯在经历了八天的武装冲突以后，到10月31日还没有安定下来，情势仍然混乱。
    应匈牙利政府请求进入布达佩斯的苏联部队，根据匈牙利政府的意见，已经在10月31日从布达佩斯撤退。
    这一天，在市内的一些地区，武装冲突仍然没有停止。武装分子正在市内搜查、追捕和射击保安部队人员，过去几天中支持政府的保安部队是在10月29日被国防部下令解散的。在这次骚乱中成立的“匈牙利学生委员会”10月31日晚向武装学生发出号召，要他们立即夺回他们的紧要的据点。在这一天，骚乱分子的一个攻击目标是夺取劳动人民党的一个党部。一个在30日成立的领导军队的“革命军事委员会”已经撤销了一批高级将领的职务，其中包括国防部第一副部长、总参谋长拉·托特上将。
    大约两千名群众星期三在匈牙利议会大厦前示威，要求纳吉政府辞职。
    截至10月31日，布达佩斯的市面还没有恢复常态。大多数工业企业没有开工。虽然街上出现了许多行人和汽车，但是，公共交通还没有恢复，铁路交通仍然受阻。
    目前，匈牙利首都的各种政治力量正在纷纷集结、调整。布达佩斯的电台在10月31日晚宣布，过去被匈牙利政府判决的政治犯都已经被释放出来。1949年以叛国罪名而被判无期徒刑的红衣主教明曾蒂已被释放。就在10月31日这一天，匈牙利社会民主党新的临时领导机构已经在布达佩斯的旧总部里选出。1947年解散的农民联盟已经恢复。匈牙利工会中央理事会主席团在31日的特别会议上辞了职，领导工作由一个“匈牙利自由工会全国联合会”的临时执行委员会担任。布达佩斯的电台在30日晚上声明，它的名称已经改为“自由科苏特电台”。它并且宣布，“电台的同人严厉地指责布达佩斯电台过去的行动”。有消息说，这表明布达佩斯电台已经被不同于过去的编辑人员政治倾向的人所控制。
    从各方面传到布拉格的消息表明，匈牙利其他地区的情况仍然是混乱复杂的。在东北部地区，包尔绍德省的企业仍未复工。重新建立的“小地主独立党”的机关报“密斯科尔兹日报”从10月31日起在密斯科尔兹复刊。驻扎在城里的苏联军队表示对这个城市的劳动者不加干预。
    在东部，得布勒森省是平静的。
    在南部，卡波斯发市已经成立了“革命全民委员会”。这个委员会在城内已经取得了权力，它要求匈牙利“立刻脱离一切军事集团”。当地的公安机关的指挥官已经被捕。在托姆巴瓦尔地方，当地苏联军队也表示决不干涉匈牙利内部事务。
    匈牙利西部和西北部地区的情况更为复杂。据悉，在最近几天中，西北部的吉厄尔的不安有了发展。那里发生了示威游行和反示威游行。一个在骚乱中建立的“国民委员会”公开反对现政府。佐洛埃格塞格市已经成立了佐洛省的“全国委员会”，它同意现政府的政纲。这个地方已经在一个晚上就成立了三个政党：小地主、资产阶级和农业劳动者党，匈牙利劳动者党和全国农民党。
