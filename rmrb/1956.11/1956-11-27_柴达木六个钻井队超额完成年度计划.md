    Xinhua News Agency, Mang'ai, 26th - Four deep drilling teams and two medium-deep drilling teams in the Qaidam Basin have exceeded their annual drilling targets assigned by the state ahead of schedule this year. Among them, Teams 1209 and 3276 completed their annual footage plans as early as late September and late October respectively. Of the ten exploratory wells successfully drilled by the six drilling teams, eight wells have already erupted or flowed with crude oil. After completing their annual tasks for this year, the employees of the six drilling teams have now drilled an additional two thousand three hundred meters; by the end of the year, they may drill an additional two thousand meters.
    The common advantages of these six well teams are: they universally attach importance to learning from the advanced Soviet experience of "high pressure, large pump volume, and appropriate speed," strictly implement technical operating procedures, implement a shift handover system, and hold regular driller meetings. At the same time, the well captains and technicians can also frequently go to the well site to check work, discover problems and solve them in a timely manner, thus ensuring that each well team can drill safely and without any major accidents.

    柴达木六个钻井队超额完成年度计划
    新华社茫崖26日电　柴达木盆地有四个深钻井队和两个中深钻井队提前超额完成了今年国家交给他们的钻探任务。其中，一二○九和三二七六两个队，早在9月下旬和10月下旬就先后完成了全年进尺计划。六个钻井队钻凿成功的十口探井，已经有八口井喷出或流出了原油。六个钻井队的职工在完成今年全年任务以后，现在已经超额钻进了二千三百多公尺；到年底他们还可能钻进二千多公尺。
    这六个井队的共同优点是：普遍重视学习苏联“重压、大泵量、适当转数”的先进经验，严格执行技术操作规程，实行交接班制度和定期召开司钻碰头会。同时，井队长和技术员也能经常深入井场检查工作，发现问题及时解决，因此保证了各井队能安全钻进，没有发生过重大事故。
