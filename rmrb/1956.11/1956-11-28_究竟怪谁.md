　　Who is to Blame After All
　　Editor:
　　The office space of the Zhejiang Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles has been in an unbelievably difficult situation for several years. A building with a dozen or so small pigeonhole-like rooms houses two editorial departments, the Youth Creative Guidance Committee, the music and art groups, as well as Party affairs and administrative staff, so crowded that there is not even enough space for desks. To solve the housing problem, we have made suggestions countless times. It was not until mid-September this year that we received a notice from the Provincial Government Affairs Administration Bureau saying that, with the Governor's approval, two small buildings at the foot of Geling Mountain by the West Lake had been allocated to the Federation of Literary and Art Circles for office use. This was originally a very happy thing. However, unexpectedly, several section chiefs from the Propaganda Department of the Provincial Party Committee, who had temporarily moved into these two buildings in early August to avoid the typhoon, repeatedly refused to move back to their already repaired and now vacant dormitories. For this matter, leading cadres and many other comrades of the Federation of Literary and Art Circles ran around, wrote official letters, made phone calls, and paid visits, conducting countless negotiations, but they still created various difficulties and refused to move out. The Federation of Literary and Art Circles had no choice. After obtaining the consent of relevant departments, they had to move into the three or five empty rooms left by the section chiefs. Unexpectedly, this offended them, and they said it was "reckless," "lacking principle," "affecting the unity of the organization," and so on, being unreasonable and acting rudely. The Federation of Literary and Art Circles had no choice but to set up temporary desks next to the toilets and in the corridors (incidentally, even these places are several times better than the original office space of the Federation), while in a conference room, in addition to concentrating more than 5,000 volumes of reference books and a large number of furniture and miscellaneous items, personnel from two different departments are crammed together to work. However, in a row of several rooms next door with steps, glass windows, screens, curtains, fluorescent lights, heating, and walls painted greener than leaves, only one or two nannies or family members and children live. A very beautiful room is only used for storage and is uninhabited; originally, a certain deputy section chief's wife also has a house, and this is just his "villa." The contrast between the dormitories and offices has become an absurd satirical painting.
　　After we moved in, we conducted many more negotiations and submitted detailed reports to the Department of Culture and Education and the Propaganda Department. The Government Affairs Administration Bureau also urged them to move out many times, but to no avail. The secretary of the Propaganda System Party Committee (who also lives inside) publicly declared, "What qualifications does the Government Affairs Administration Bureau have to tell us to move houses!" Under these circumstances, our responsible person had to go to the Minister of Propaganda again, but still did not receive the support he deserved.
　　This situation has been going on for more than a month (we moved in on October 5th). Currently, our work cannot proceed. Because of this, we have declined several times to receive foreign cultural guests who wanted to visit our association. We don't understand why they can ignore the Governor's instructions just because they covet good housing? As the Party Committee's propaganda department, why do they adopt such an attitude towards the difficulties of the Federation of Literary and Art Circles? Why can't we solve the problem even after writing many reports and visiting the minister many times?
　　Now, we have done everything we can and should do. We cannot watch our work suffer losses, and we must protest against the privileged thinking of several section chiefs of the Provincial Party Committee's Propaganda Department. We loudly appeal to you, hoping to assist us in resolving this issue as soon as possible.　　　　　　Zhuó Fēi

    究竟怪谁
    编辑同志：
    浙江省文联的办公处所，几年来一直处在令人难以置信的困难境地。一幢十几间小鸽笼样的房子，除容纳了两个编辑部和青年创作指导委员会、音乐、美术组外，还有党务和行政工作人员，挤得连办公桌子都放不下。为了解决房子问题，我们不知道提过多少次意见，直到今年9月中旬，才接到省机关事务管理局的通知说，经省长决定把里西湖葛岭山麓的两幢小楼房拨给文联作办公处所。这本是使人十分高兴的事情。但是，想不到8月初为避台风而到这两幢楼房暂住的省委宣传部的几位处长，却一再不肯搬回早已修好、如今还空着的宿舍。为这件事，文联的领导干部和其他许多同志东奔西跑，写公文，打电话，登门拜访，不知办了多少交涉，他们仍然是多方刁难，不肯搬出。文联实在无法，在征得有关部门同意后，只好搬到处长们住剩下的三、五间空房子里。想不到这可触犯了他们，他们说这是“胡来”、“没有原则性”、“影响机关团结”等等，蛮不讲理，态度粗暴。文联不得已，只好在厕所旁、走廊里（附带提一下，即使是这些地方也比文联原来的办公处所好几倍）临时架设桌子办公，而在一间会议室里，除集中了五千余册资料图书和大批家具杂物外，还有两个不同部门的人员挤在一起办公。但是，就在隔壁一排几间有着台阶、玻璃窗、纱窗、窗帘、日光灯、暖气和四壁刷得比树叶还绿的房子里，却只住着保姆或家属、小孩一、二名。有一间非常漂亮的房子里，只放东西不住人，原来某副处长的爱人也有房子，这里只是他的“别墅”。宿舍和办公室对比，成了一幅使人啼笑皆非的讽刺画。
    我们搬进来以后，又办了许多交涉，给文教部、宣传部都作了详细报告，机关事务管理局也多次催他们搬走，均无效。宣传系统党委书记（他也住在里边）公开扬言说：“机关事务管理局有什么资格叫我们搬房子！”在这种情况下，我们的负责人只好再去找宣传部长，但是仍然没有得到应有的支持。
    这种情况已经继续一月有余了（我们是10月5号搬来的）。目前我们的工作已无法进行。因为如此，曾几次托辞谢绝了要来我会参观的文化外宾。我们不明白，他们为什么贪恋好房子就可以不执行省长的指示？作为党委宣传部门，对文联的困难为什么采取这样的态度？为什么我们写了许多报告，找了许多次部长都不能解决问题？
    如今，我们能办的和应该办的都办了。我们不能看着工作受损失，对省委宣传部的几位处长的特权思想不能不提出抗议，我们向你们大声呼吁，希望协助我们尽速解决这个问题。　　　　　　濯菲
