Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 30th. The Tianjin Livestock Products Company invited personnel in charge of procurement from the agricultural product purchasing departments of eight provinces, including Hebei, Shanxi, and Liaoning, to a symposium from October 26th to 29th.

    Personnel from the company stated at the meeting that many varieties of livestock products planned to be supplied by various regions to Tianjin for export this year have not fulfilled the plan. As a result, by the end of the third quarter, the company's order plan had only reached 70%. Major products such as casings, sheep wool skins, and pig bristles are far from meeting the planned amounts.

    After learning about this situation, the attendees from various regions decided to take measures to increase the supply in the fourth quarter. Shaanxi and Henan provinces originally had no plans to supply Tianjin with cowhide, but now they have decided to supply Tianjin with an excess of 120,000 cowhides for export. Heilongjiang and Shandong provinces have decided to increase the supply of 130,000 to 140,000 pig casings in the fourth quarter through expanded procurement and processing. Henan and Hebei provinces will reallocate 100,000 sheepskins, originally planned to be supplied to Shandong for domestic sales, to Tianjin for export.

    保证完成畜产品出口计划
    河北等八省增加供应出口货源
    据新华社天津30日电　天津市畜产公司邀请河北、山西、辽宁等八个省的农产品采购厅采购业务负责人员在10月26日到29日开座谈会。
    这个公司的人员在会上说，今年各地计划供应天津出口的畜产品中，很多品种没有完成计划，以至到第三季度末，公司的订货计划还只完成70％，主要产品如肠衣、绵羊毛皮、猪鬃等都和计划相差很多。
    各地到会人员了解到这个情况以后，都决定采取措施，在第四季度内增加供应量。陕西、河南两省原来都没有供应天津牛皮的计划，现在决定把多余的十二万张牛皮供应天津出口。黑龙江、山东两省决定通过扩大收购和加工，第四季度增加供应十三、四万根猪肠衣。河南、河北两省把原计划供应山东省内销的十万张绵羊皮，改调天津出口。
