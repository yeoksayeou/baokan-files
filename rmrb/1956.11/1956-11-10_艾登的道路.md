    Eden's Road
    There is a Chinese saying, "The final verdict comes when the coffin is sealed." Mr. Eden is still serving as the British Prime Minister and is busy invading Egypt, but on November 3rd he prepared words for his own epitaph: "A lifelong man of peace."
    Eden's practice of putting rouge on his own face can only provoke disgust.
    Eden has his own path of development. When Hitler launched his aggression, Eden opposed it. At that time, he resigned as Foreign Secretary for this reason. After the end of World War II, Eden gradually changed, moving from opposing aggression to following Chamberlain's path of condoning aggression. When the United States openly used the US-Chiang treaty to obstruct the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan, Eden supported the United States' aggressive behavior. And now, Eden has gone from condoning aggression to carrying out aggression, simply learning from the example of Hitler, whom he once opposed, and carrying out armed aggression against Egypt.
    Eden's fate is still unknown. However, judging from the path Eden has taken, it can be asserted that this self-proclaimed person is in no way a "lifelong" "man of peace."

### 艾登的道路

    艾登的道路
    中国有句话，叫做“盖棺论定”。艾登先生现在还在充当英国首相，并且正在忙着侵略埃及，可是他在11月3日却已经给自己准备下了可以用之于墓志铭上的话：“毕生是一个和平人物”。
    艾登这种往自己脸上擦粉的做法，只能引起人们恶心。
    艾登是有他的发展的道路的。在希特勒发动侵略的时候，艾登是反对侵略的。那时候，他曾经为此辞去外交大臣的职务。二次大战结束以后，艾登渐渐变了，由反对侵略走上了纵容侵略的张伯伦的道路。在美国公然用美蒋条约来阻挠中国人民解放台湾的时候，艾登曾经支持美国的侵略行为。而现在，艾登又从纵容侵略走到了进行侵略，干脆学起他从前反对过的希特勒的榜样，对埃及实行起武装侵略来了。
    艾登的下场如何现在还不知道。但是，从艾登所走的道路看来，可以断言，这个自吹自捧的人，无论如何不是“毕生”都是“和平人物”。
