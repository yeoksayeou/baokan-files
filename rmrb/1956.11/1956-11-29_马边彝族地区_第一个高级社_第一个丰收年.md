    Mabian Yi Ethnic Region
    The First Advanced Cooperative and the First Year of Good Harvest
    (Our report) The "July 1st" Agricultural Production Cooperative is the first advanced agricultural cooperative established this spring in the Yi ethnic region of Mabian County after the successful completion of the democratic reform. The cooperative, with its sixty-three member households, fought against floods and animal plagues this summer and achieved its first good harvest since its establishment. This year, the total income of the cooperative from corn, millet, and soybeans converted to more than 4,000 yuan in Renminbi. Member Mo Xi Muba's income last year was 63 yuan, but this year his income increased by 93 yuan, which is about one and a half times more than last year. The fact that income increased educated every member, and their enthusiasm for production became even greater. A'liuge Ha's wife, Qu Bi Da Ha, used to only work a few days a month, but now she works every day.

    马边彝族地区
    第一个高级社　第一个丰收年
    本报讯　“七一”农业生产合作社，是今年春天马边县彝族地区胜利完成民主改革后，建立起来的第一个高级农业社。全社六十三户社员今年夏天和洪灾兽患作斗争的结果，获得了建社后的第一个丰收。今年全社收入的玉米、黄谷、黄豆共折合人民币四千余元。社员莫西母巴去年收入六十三元，今年多收入了九十三元，比去年的收入增加了约一倍半。增加收入的事实教育了每个社员，他们的生产劲头更大了。社员阿六格哈的爱人曲必大哈过去一个月只出工几天，现在每天都出工了。
