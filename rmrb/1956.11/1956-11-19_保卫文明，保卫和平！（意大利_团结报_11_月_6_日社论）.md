Defend Civilization, Defend Peace!
(Editorial from the Italian newspaper "Unità," November 6)
Togliatti

The first thing to do is to expose hypocrisy and state the truth straightforwardly.

It is not through our fault that Europe is unfortunately divided into two blocs today. These two blocs are based on two military alliances; however, everyone knows, everyone has admitted, and everyone still admits that they have not only military content but also political content. We Italians especially understand this because it has been repeatedly said in various tones and from various aspects that if the "Western" order in our country is in crisis, there will be American intervention to quell the crisis, and this will occur in accordance with the spirit and explicit terms of the Atlantic Treaty.

We have always opposed this situation. We have suggested abandoning the system of hostile blocs and organizing international life on other foundations, on the opposite basis. All proposals aimed at achieving this goal, or even just approaching it, have not only been rejected, but the Western military-political bloc has been expanded to include Bonn Germany, violating previous international agreements and unilaterally reorganizing an army: an army staffed by former Nazi officers. Ah! What a great victory it would be for Western democracy if the Warsaw Pact were no longer an obstacle to these attempts to revive those unforgettable dreams!

Those who have forgotten these facts, or who pretend to have forgotten them, sing the praises of non-interference and freedom on the one hand, but on the other hand, they are furious about the Soviet Union's current actions in Hungary, launching vicious attacks on the Soviet Union and our movement. They are hypocrites, pale ghosts, and we have every right to despise them. They have always cheered the military bloc system; moreover, most of them have always applauded military intervention as long as it is used against the forces of the people, to crush the possibility of democratic development.

In Hungary, the development of events from the very beginning has clearly revealed that the inevitable outcome would be to pose a serious and fundamental problem for the Soviet Union and other Eastern European countries; serious and disturbing, especially because such a problem arises not only when world security and peace are threatened but also when world security and peace are in a precarious situation, so much so that no one knows what will happen tomorrow. Nevertheless, the Soviet Union acted cautiously and without recklessness. It intervened for the first time at the request of the Hungarian government to deal with the disturbances, but it did not thereby trap itself. On the contrary, it issued a solemn declaration at the same time, stating its unwillingness to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries and to undermine the sovereignty of other countries. It began negotiations on the withdrawal of Soviet troops and automatically began to withdraw troops, declaring that it was doing so to facilitate the resolution of the situation. But what did it encounter in just a few days? Anarchy and white terror; a government reorganized three times in two days, each time more inclined towards reaction; this government refused to take action against armed terrorists, and the Prime Minister himself incited these elements with incredible remarks. At the same time, large groups of armed bandits poured in from abroad and appeared in the country. These notorious fascist bandits brandished old symbols, raised old black flags, and brought out chieftains who openly yearned to climb onto the vacant seat of dictatorship.

This is how things developed. This conclusion can be drawn from the reports of those eyewitnesses belonging to the opposing camp. Among these eyewitnesses, first and foremost, is that scoundrel who said that the rows of communist workers hanging upside down on the lampposts of Budapest were a terrible sight, but he was very happy to see it. However, this situation is in line with the logic of political struggle and class struggle.

In view of this, I believe that if the Soviet army, when invited for the second time, had refused to act, refused to exert all its strength, in the name of the spirit of unity that should unite the peoples of all countries – first and foremost, the peoples of all countries that have embarked on the road of socialism – to block the road of white terror and crush fascism, then the Soviet Union should have been protested against. We do not believe that there can be any hesitation in the hearts of the workers on this issue, because the reactionaries have long been unhesitatingly rejoicing that their flags have once again been raised in Hungary. It is possible that some people are influenced by the enemy's frantic incitement, and therefore hesitate, waver, and even take the wrong path. But these people will subsequently correct their views. It is not surprising or uncommon that some people in the workers' movement only understand the essence of things after a few months or even several years. The essence is obvious. Moreover, the words of Mr. Nagy are not credible, and the members of the successive moribund governments are nothing. What is important is: what would certainly happen if the Hungarian working class and people did not receive decisive and strong assistance.

Moreover, the problem is not only related to Hungary but also to us, to the whole of Europe. Nagy, after indeed trying to increase the chaos, thereby making the disaster even more serious, actually asked the United States to send paratroopers to intervene, that is, to provoke war, which exposed his true colors; but if Hungary fell into the hands of an openly reactionary government, then what other way out would there be besides leading to war? Then there would begin border incidents, provocations, and all the preparatory steps for armed conflict that we are familiar with. When the imperialist powers or several of them intervene, adding fuel to the fire to ignite the flames of war, what international organization will come forward to intervene to restore order?

The most serious key to the whole problem lies here. Today, there is no longer any international organization capable of taking action to stop the march towards war. France and Britain, to the shock of the peoples of the world, have openly prepared for and are carrying out a war of aggression against Egypt. They have violated all treaties, agreements, and conventions. They have defied the condemnation of the United Nations General Assembly. They are unscrupulously waging war, and that is the situation. Should we then condemn the Soviet Union at such a juncture, demanding that it let white terror and war provocateurs have their way in Hungary, and if the Soviet Union does not do so, should we condemn it?

The Soviet Union has a duty to prevent the establishment of a base for war provocation on its borders, especially at present, it has a duty to defend all positions of the front for the maintenance of peace, so that these positions are not subjected to any rupture and any weakening. The Soviet Union has this responsibility not only to itself, to the countries and peoples of Eastern Europe, but also to us, to the peoples of all countries in the world. Faced with the current developments in the world, exploring the course of the tragic events in Hungary has taken a secondary place. We must strive to understand this. We must try to appreciate that our responsibility in Italy lies in facing the situation squarely, uniting to defend peace, and repelling the attacks of the reactionaries; we fully understand where it will lead and what the consequences will be if the forces of the people appear disunited and open the way for the attacks of the reactionaries.

    保卫文明，保卫和平！
    （意大利“团结报”11月6日社论）
    陶里亚蒂
    首要的事情是揭穿伪善，直截了当地说明真相。
    不是由于我们的过错，欧洲今日不幸分裂为两个集团。这两个集团的基础是两个军事联盟；然而，人人知道，人人曾经承认，人人已经承认：它们不仅具有军事内容，而且具有政治内容。我们意大利人尤其了解这一点，因为人们以种种腔调、从各个方面一再说过：假如“西方”秩序在我国处于危机之中，为了平息危机，就会有美国的干涉，就会依据大西洋公约的精神和明文而发生美国的干涉。
    我们一向反对这种状况。我们曾经建议放弃敌对的集团体系，建议在其他的基础上、在与此相反的基础上组织国际生活。一切为了达到这个目的、甚至只是接近这个目的而提出的建议不仅已遭拒绝，而且西方军事政治集团已经扩大，包括了波恩德国，违反前此的种种国际协定，在片面决定之下重新组织了一支军队：由纳粹军官充任骨干的军队。啊！华沙条约一旦不再成为堵塞这些借尸还魂者梦寐难忘的尝试的障碍，对于西方民主该是一个多么大的胜利！
    那些忘记了这些事实的人们，或者假装已经忘记的人们，一面唱出不干涉和自由的高调；另一方面却由于苏联目前在匈牙利的行动狂怒不已，大肆攻击苏联和我们的运动的人，他们就是伪善者、苍白的幽灵，而我们正有权利予以鄙视。他们一向对军事集团制度欢呼雀躁，不仅如此，他们中间大多数人还一向鼓掌欢迎军事干涉，只要这种干涉是用来反对人民力量，是用来粉碎民主发展的可能性。
    在匈牙利，事态发展从开始之时起已经明显揭示必不可免的终点会是：对于苏联，对于东欧其他国家，提出一个令人不安的严重的根本问题；严重而且令人不安，尤其是因为这样一个问题是不仅在全世界安全与和平受到威胁，而且在全世界安全与和平正处于风雨飘摇的局面中出现的，以至于谁也不知道明天会发生什么事情。尽管如此，苏联还是慎重从事，毫不卤莽。它第一次被请求进行干涉来对付骚乱，它就进行了干涉，但是它并没有因而作茧自缚，相反，它在采取这个行动的同时发表了一个郑重宣言表明：不愿干涉他国内政，不愿损害别国主权。它就撤退苏军问题开始了谈判，而且自动开始撤退军队，同时宣称这样做是为了便利于解决时局问题。但是，几天之间它遇到的是怎样的情况呢，无政府状态和白色恐怖；一个政府在两天之中三次改组，每一次都更加倾向于反动；这个政府拒绝为反对武装恐怖分子而行动，总理自己反而以令人难以置信的言论来刺激这些分子；在这同时，大股武装匪徒从外国涌入并在国内出现，这些彰明昭著的法西斯匪徒，打出旧标记，举起旧黑旗，抬出了已经公然渴望爬上虚位以待的独裁者座位的匪首。
    事情就是这样发展的。从属于反对我们的阵营的那些目睹者的报道中可以得出这种结论。这些目睹者之中首先就有那个混蛋：他说布达佩斯大街灯柱上倒吊着的一行行共产党工人是一个可怕的景象，但是他看了很高兴。不过，这种情况倒是合乎政治斗争和阶级斗争的逻辑的。
    既然这样，我认为：假如苏联军队在第二次受到邀请的时候，不肯出力，不肯出动全力，以应该使各国人民——首先是已经走上社会主义道路的各国人民——联合起来保卫文明的团结精神的名义来堵塞白色恐怖的道路和粉碎法西斯主义，那才应该对苏联提出抗议。我们不相信劳动者的心中在这个问题上能有所犹豫，因为反动势力早已毫不犹豫地对他们的旗帜已经又一次在匈牙利境内升起而兴高采烈起来了。可能有人受到敌人疯狂煽动的影响，因而犹豫，动摇，以至走错道路。但是这种人随后会把看法纠正过来的。在工人运动中有些人在几个月之后，甚至若干年之后才理解事物的本质，这是不足为奇的，也是屡见不鲜的。本质是显而易见的。何况，纳吉先生的言词不足为信，而历届奄奄待毙的政府的成员先生们是不算什么的。重要的是：假如匈牙利工人阶级和人民得不到决定性的强大的援助就一定会有怎样的结果。
    何况问题不仅仅牵涉匈牙利，也关系到我们，关系到整个欧洲。纳吉在确实致力于增加混乱从而使灾难更加深重之后，竟然要求美国派遣伞兵来进行干涉，就是说要挑起战争，这就暴露了他的真面目；但是如果匈牙利落入公开反动政府之手，那么除了导向战争，还会有什么别的出路呢？接着就会开始发生边境事件、挑衅以及我们所熟知的武装冲突的一切准备步骤。当帝国主义大国或者其中几个插手干涉、火上加油来燃起战火的时候，又会有什么国际机构出面干涉来恢复秩序呢？
    整个问题的最严重的关键就在这里。今天不再有能够采取行动以阻止走向战争的进程的任何国际机构。法国和英国在使世界各国人民震惊的情况下公然准备了和正在进行对埃及的侵略战争。它们违反了一切条约、协定和公约。它们藐视联合国大会的谴责。它们肆无忌惮地在进行战争，情况就是这样。难道我们应该在这样的时际来谴责苏联、要求苏联让匈牙利白色恐怖和战争挑衅者为所欲为，而如果苏联不那么作，我们就谴责它吗？
    苏联有责任防止在它的边境上建立起挑起战争的根据地，特别在目前它有责任保卫维护和平的阵线的一切阵地，使这些阵地不致遭受任何破裂和任何削弱。苏联不仅对自己、对东欧各国与人民有这种责任，对我们、对全世界各国人民也有这种责任。面对目前世界上的事态发展，探究匈牙利悲惨事件的经过已退居次要地位。我们要力求了解这一点。我们要尽力体会到：我们在意大利的责任在于正视形势、团结一致来保卫和平、击退反动派的进攻；我们十分明白：如果人民力量呈现出不团结而为反动派的进攻开辟道路，就会导向哪里，就会造成什么结局。
