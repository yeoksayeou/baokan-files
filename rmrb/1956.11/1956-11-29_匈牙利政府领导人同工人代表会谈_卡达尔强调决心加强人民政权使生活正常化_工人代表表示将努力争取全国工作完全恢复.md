Xinhua News Agency, Prague, November 28th. According to a report by the Czechoslovak News Agency: On November 25th, the Hungarian Revolutionary Worker-Peasant Government held a consultation meeting in the Parliament Building with leading staff members from various ministries, representatives of workers' committees from various industrial enterprises in Budapest, government commissioners, factory directors, prominent technicians, and representatives from various trade unions.

Kadar's Speech

Prime Minister Kadar delivered the main speech at the meeting.

Kadar first analyzed the characteristics of each stage of the Hungarian events. He clearly distinguished between those who demanded the correction of the previous leadership's mistakes in the early stages of the events and those who aimed to overthrow the people's government. He pointed out that the riots were carried out by a very well-organized military force.

Kadar said that another characteristic of the events was that on the day of the ceasefire on October 30th, counter-revolutionary activities became more open and blatant than before. He also pointed out how the counter-revolutionaries obtained reinforcements from abroad.

Kadar said, "Another characteristic of the events is that Nagy's activities after October 30th shielded the counter-revolutionaries. This kind of action can only be described as shielding the counter-revolutionaries. On the one hand, the actions of the leaders of those coalition governments showed that they had no backbone, paying lip service to democracy here while distorting the truth in fact. On the other hand, the counter-revolutionaries were rampant in the streets, massacring progressive people."

Next, Kadar clearly explained the progressive nature of Soviet troops' assistance. He recalled that after the Soviet troops left Budapest, the counter-revolutionaries ran wild, which showed that if the Soviet troops withdrew, the counter-revolutionaries would destroy the people's government, and there would be no question of national independence.

Kadar once again exposed the reactionary nature of the slogan of Hungarian neutrality that was put forward at that time. He said that this deceptive slogan of the counter-revolutionaries was only the first step. A week later, they might announce that Hungary would join the Atlantic Treaty and declare it necessary to invite American troops in. He said: However, they would not stop there. If the counter-revolutionaries actually seized power and extinguished the progressive people, war would immediately break out on Hungarian territory. The fact that there is no war today should be attributed to the socialist world being militarily stronger than the Western world.

Prime Minister Kadar said that the government avoided this fate and decided to crush the counter-revolutionaries with the help of Soviet troops, strengthen the people's democratic government, restore the rule of law, and normalize domestic life. After all this is achieved, the Revolutionary Worker-Peasant Government will hold negotiations with the Soviet government on the issue of the withdrawal of Soviet troops. This is the government's program, and the government believes that the overwhelming majority of the Hungarian people, especially workers and peasants, will agree with this program. The government cannot adopt a conciliatory attitude, which is also part of the program, because practice has shown that it is impossible to disarm the counter-revolutionaries with a conciliatory attitude. As soon as order is restored—but not before—the government will be expanded immediately. After the counter-revolutionaries are completely crushed and order and work are restored, then it will be possible to sit down and negotiate solutions to all problems.

Kadar emphasized that the government first hopes to ensure a life without worries. After the murderers change their attitudes and no longer engage in looting and threatening those workers who want to return to work, arrests will be stopped.

Kadar talked about Nagy in his speech. He said that Nagy and his group said they wanted to leave Hungarian territory. It would not be correct to allow the counter-revolutionaries hiding in Budapest to possibly assassinate one of them for the purpose of provocation and then blame the murder on the government in front of the whole world. It is also possible that someone whose relatives were tortured and massacred by counter-revolutionaries might want to kill Nagy and his gang to avenge his relatives. If this happens, the responsibility will also be placed on the government. Kadar said that the government does not intend to punish Nagy and his group for their actions, although they bear a great responsibility. He pointed out that Nagy and his companions going to friendly socialist countries does not mean being exiled.

Kadar finally emphasized that the counter-revolutionaries are inciting strikes and boycotts, but they are increasingly unable to succeed. The people demand work, demand a normal life, and demand the maintenance of law and order. Kadar said: We must boldly defend the correct position. We have gained such experience: if we put the problem boldly and openly, people with malicious intentions will not dare to come out, and those who are silent will be silent. Kadar emphasized that in many enterprises and institutions, when the counter-revolutionaries threaten the majority with terror, honest people simply dare not express their honest positions. This situation must end.

Opro Discusses the Economic Situation

Minister of Heavy Industry Opro spoke about the current economic situation in Hungary at the consultation meeting. He said that the government believes that its primary task is to organize the supply of food and industrial products to the people. We want to consult with some friendly countries and ask for loans in the form of industrial products in order to maintain balance. However, we cannot only rely on support. The future and destiny of the country can only be built on its own strength, production, and creative work.

Opro said that since the events, Hungary's losses in production have reached five or six billion forints, perhaps even more. Tens of billions of forints have been paid out as wages, but nothing has been produced. Therefore, this huge amount of money means a huge danger. He called on the heads of financial and economic institutions and economic departments, as well as workers and members of workers' committees, to protect the forint, cherish national property, and consider the country's revenue and expenditure.

Opro emphasized: Production is the foundation for stabilizing economic life. Those who incite strikes want to weaken the people's government politically and economically. Defending people's property, starting production, stopping irresponsible rampages by small groups in enterprises, and intimidating workers in industry and transportation—this is the basic responsibility of every worker, regardless of what position he holds in state organs or in workers' committees. The main goal of efforts must be to rapidly increase coal production and electricity production. Friendly countries require us to do our best to ensure transit transportation. Railways must work day and night, which is in the national interest and an international obligation.

Opro said that in the work of restoring production and enabling production to develop, trade union organizations and workers' committees undertake particularly important tasks. Workers' committees and trade union organizations must learn how to save. It is not enough to want to get management power, but also to know how to use it. Life will show how to expand or amend certain provisions of the law on workers' committees, but now it is necessary to implement this law and put it into life, and it is also necessary to teach workers' committees to manage the economy.

Opro said that we must concentrate our efforts on production work.

One factory after another asked representatives of various ministries to go there to help them solve difficulties and ensure that they are supplied with raw materials, and also asked workers' leaders to go among them. Therefore, it is necessary to establish political unity in these leading organs. Everyone must show which side he is on, on the side of democracy or on the side of the counter-revolution. Those who stand on the side of the counter-revolution get out! We do not want people who waver in pursuit of fame and fortune. Now we must work and create for the real interests of the people. People with conscience and honor, people who want to serve the people, must prove it with creative work.

Opro said that recently many politically conscious workers and organized old workers have come to the government, expressing their willingness to contribute their strength to restoring order and developing production. We will do everything possible to allow these well-tested old comrades to participate in the work, let them organize production, and let them get appropriate positions. Many of them demanded that we not forgive the current hesitation and opportunism. They hope that the Revolutionary Worker-Peasant Government will implement a more resolute policy.

Opro said that in the past two weeks, the government has received hundreds of workers' delegations. In this way, we have had the opportunity to meet many outstanding members of the workers' committees. However, some members are not workers at all, but elements who have only recently entered the factory. The government firmly advocates that workers' committees must be led by workers. It is necessary to nominate and elect the truly best workers in the enterprise to take on important responsibilities. We have received reports from many places that anti-democratic elements are manipulating everything in some workers' committees. This kind of practice cannot be tolerated! The working people in the enterprise know each other well and must choose the best people from among them! This is the government's hope and suggestion to the workers and workers' committees. They should purify their organizations. As for trade union organizations, they are of great importance in our conditions. They are the broadest mass organizations of the working people and actively cooperate in establishing the rule of law and protecting the rights of the working people. We support them. The government has recently received many correct resolutions, proposals, and suggestions from the wage policy department of our trade unions. We can see that the comrades in the trade unions are working seriously and responsibly, but we ask them to play a greater role in organizational work and fully restoring production.

Opro finally said that the current political situation shows that order, normal life, and production have been restored in 80% of the country. In various places, the task of economic work leaders is also to improve the situation in a similar way.

Minister of State Marosan also spoke at the meeting. He mentioned many concrete materials illustrating the methods used by counter-revolutionaries to seize power. He also talked about the great significance of the current international situation and the assistance given to Hungary by socialist countries.

Speeches by Workers' Representatives

When Lajos Kresteš, a representative of the Budapest Workers' Committee, spoke at the meeting, he put forward some suggestions regarding the powers of the workers' committees. He also emphasized that the Budapest Workers' Committee knows the harmful effects of strikes, so it decided to resume work in order to consolidate order and develop democratic initiative.

Others participating in the discussion also unanimously expressed the opinion that fully restoring production work is the main task of all honest Hungarian citizens.

Gyert Kalocsa, a member of the Budapest Workers' Committee, talked about the enemy's provocative activities. They spread rumors that all members of the Budapest Workers' Committee had been arrested, and leaflets had been issued calling for a strike over the issue of Imre Nagy. He said that last night we received about fifteen phone calls asking us if it was true that we had decided to hold a ten-day strike. This is provocation! The worker also said that enough has been said, we need practical action. After discussing with Comrade Prime Minister, we reached a consensus: we will strive to fully restore work throughout the country, because this is not a matter of personal interest, but of the interest of all the Hungarian people.

    匈牙利政府领导人同工人代表会谈
    卡达尔强调决心加强人民政权使生活正常化
    工人代表表示将努力争取全国工作完全恢复
    新华社布拉格28日电　据捷克斯洛伐克通讯社报道：匈牙利工农革命政府11月25日在议会大厦同各部的领导工作人员、布达佩斯各工业企业工人委员会的代表、政府委员、各企业厂长、著名技术人员和各工会的代表举行了协商会议。
    卡达尔总理的发言
    卡达尔总理在会上作了主要的发言。
    卡达尔首先分析了匈牙利事件中各阶段的特点。他把在事件的初期，那些要求纠正以前的领导机构的错误的人同那些目的在推翻人民政权的人明确地区别开来。他指出，这次暴乱是由有非常周密的军事组织搞的。
    卡达尔说，事件的另一个特点是，在10月30日停战的那一天，反革命活动比以前更加公开和露骨。他并且指出，反革命是怎样从国外取得增援的。
    卡达尔说，“事件的又一个特点是：纳吉在10月30日以后的活动包庇了反革命。这种行动只能说是包庇反革命。一方面，那些联合政府的领导人的行动表明他们没有骨气，口头上在这里侈谈民主，事实是歪曲真相，另一方面反革命分子却在街上大肆猖獗，屠杀进步人民。”
    接着，卡达尔清楚地解释了苏联军队援助的进步性质。他回顾说，当苏军离开了布达佩斯以后，反革命就大肆猖獗起来，这说明了如果苏军撤走以后，反革命将会摧毁人民政权，那就谈不上再会有什么民族独立了。
    卡达尔再一次揭露了当时所提出来的主张匈牙利中立的口号的反动性质。他说，反革命的这种笼络人心的口号仅仅是第一步，一个星期以后就可能会宣布匈牙利将参加大西洋公约，宣布有必要请美国部队开进来。他说：然而，他们也不会就到这里为止，如果反革命竟然夺得了统治权，扑灭了进步人民，匈牙利领土上立即就会爆发战争。今天没有战争这一事实，应该归功于社会主义世界在军事上比西方世界更加强大。
    卡达尔总理说，政府避免了这种命运，并且决定在苏联部队的援助下粉碎反革命，加强人民民主政权，恢复法制和使国内生活正常化。在这一切实现以后，工农革命政府将同苏联政府就苏联部队撤离问题举行谈判。这就是政府的纲领，政府相信，压倒大多数的匈牙利人民，特别是工人和农民将会同意这个纲领。政府不能采取调和的态度，这也是纲领的一部分，因为实践表明，想用调和的态度使反革命解除武装是不可能的。一俟秩序恢复——但是不能比这更早——政府将立即扩大。在反革命被完全粉碎，秩序和工作恢复以后，那时将可以坐下来谈判解决一切问题。
    卡达尔强调说，政府首先希望保证毫无顾虑的生活。在杀人者们改变了态度，不再从事劫掠、威胁那些希望复工的工人以后，就将停止逮捕。
    卡达尔在他的发言中谈到了纳吉。他说，纳吉和他的集团说他们希望离开匈牙利领土。如果听任隐藏在布达佩斯的反革命分子有可能为挑拨的企图而暗杀掉他们中间的一个人，然后在全世界面前把谋杀的责任加在政府头上，那就会是不正确的。还可能发生这样的事：有亲属遭到反革命分子拷打和屠杀的人可能想要杀掉纳吉一伙人来为他的亲属报仇。如果发生这种情况，也会把责任加在政府头上的。卡达尔说，政府并不打算为了纳吉和他的集团的行动而惩罚他们，虽然他们要负很大的责任。他指出，纳吉和他的伙伴动身到友好的社会主义国家去并不意味着是被放逐。
    卡达尔最后强调说，反革命分子在煽动罢工和抵制，但是他们越来越不能得逞。人民要求工作，要求过正常的人的生活，要求保持法律秩序。卡达尔说：必须大胆地维护正确的立场。我们得到了这样的经验：如果我们把问题大胆地和公开地摆出来的话，心怀恶意的人们就不敢出来，而默不作声了。卡达尔强调指出，在许多企业和机关中，当反革命分子用恐怖手段威胁大多数人的时候，正直的人简直是不敢表示他们的正直的立场的。这种情况必须结束。
    奥普罗谈经济情况
    重工业部部长奥普罗在协商会议上谈到了目前匈牙利的经济情况。他说，政府认为它的首要任务就是组织供应人民粮食和工业品的工作。我们要同一些友好国家进行磋商，要求给予工业品形式的贷款，以便保持平衡。但是，我们不能光是依赖支持。国家的前途和命运只能够建立在自己的力量、生产和创造性工作上。
    奥普罗说，自从事件发生以来，匈牙利在生产方面遭到的损失达到了五、六十亿福林，也许还不止。有好几十亿福林是作为工资付出的，但是却没有生产出任何东西，因此，这笔巨额款项意味着巨大的危险。他号召财政金融机关和经济部门的负责人以及工人和工人委员会的委员保护福林，爱护国家财产，考虑国家的收支状况。
    奥普罗强调说：生产是稳定经济生活的基础，那些煽动罢工的人是想要在政治上和经济上削弱人民政权。保卫人民财产，开始生产，制止小集团在企业中不负责任的猖獗活动和在工业和运输业中恫吓工人——这是每一个劳动者的基本职责，而不管他在国家机关中或是在工人委员会中担负着何种职务。努力的主要目标必须是迅速增加煤的产量和电力的生产。友好国家要求我们尽力保证过境的运输。铁路必须日夜工作，这是国家利益和国际义务。
    奥普罗说，在恢复生产和使生产能够发展起来的工作中，工会组织和工人委员会承担着特别重要的任务。工人委员会和工会组织必须学会如何节约。希望得到管理权是不够的，还需要知道如何来使用它。生活将会表明如何来扩大或修改关于工人委员会的法律的某些条款，但是现在有必要把这项法律付诸实施，把它放在生活当中，也有必要教会工人委员会管理经济。
    奥普罗说，必须集中力量在生产工作上。
    工厂一个接着一个要求各部的代表到他们那里去，帮助他们解决困难，保证给他们以原料，又要求工人领袖到他们中间去。因此必须在这些领导机关中建立政治上的团结。每个人必须表示他站在那一边，在民主的一边呢还是在反革命的一边。站在反革命一边的人滚开！我们不要追求名位的动摇的人们。现在必须工作，为人民的真正利益进行创造。有良心和荣誉心的人，想为人民服务的人，要用创造性的工作来证明。
    奥普罗说，最近很多政治上觉悟的工人和有组织的老工人到政府来，表示愿意在恢复秩序和发展生产方面贡献他们的力量。我们将尽一切力量让这些受过很好考验的老同志参加工作，让他们组织生产，让他们得到适当的职位。他们中许多人要求我们不要宽恕目前的犹豫不决和机会主义。希望工农革命政府执行更加坚决的政策。
    奥普罗说，过去两个星期中，政府接见了成百个工人代表团。这样，我们有机会会见了工人委员会中的许多杰出的委员。但是，有一些委员根本不是工人，而是最近才进入工厂的那些分子。政府坚决主张工人委员会必须由工人领导。必须提名和选举企业中真正最优秀的工人来担任负有重大责任的职务。我们从许多地方接到报告说，反民主分子在某些工人委员会中操纵一切。不能容忍这种做法！企业里的劳动人民互相有充分的了解，必须从他们中间选择最优秀的人！这就是政府对工人们和工人委员会的希望和建议。他们应该纯洁他们的组织。至于工会组织，在我们的条件下它们具有巨大的重要意义。它们是劳动人民最广泛的群众组织，在建立法制和保卫劳动人民的权利方面给予积极的合作。我们支持它们。政府最近从我们工会的工资政策部门接到了许多正确的决议、主张和建议。我们可以看出，工会中的同志们是认真负责地工作的，但是我们要求他们在组织工作和完全恢复生产方面发挥更大的积极性。
    奥普罗最后说，目前的政治形势表明，全国80％的地区已经恢复了秩序、正常生活和生产。在各地，经济工作领导人的任务也是用类似的办法来改善情况。
    国务部长马罗山也在会上讲了话。他提到了许多说明反革命分子设法夺取政权的方法的具体材料。他还谈到目前国际情况和社会主义国家给予匈牙利的援助的巨大意义。
    工人代表的讲话
    布达佩斯工人委员会代表拉约什·克列斯特斯在会上讲话的时候，提出了一些关于工人委员会职权的建议。他并且强调指出，布达佩斯工人委员会知道罢工的有害影响，因此决定复工，以便使秩序得到巩固，民主的主动性得到发展。
    其他参加讨论的人也一致表示了这样的意见：完全恢复生产工作是所有正直的匈牙利公民的主要任务。
    布达佩斯工人委员会委员捷尔特·卡洛柴谈到敌人的挑拨活动。他们散布谣言说布达佩斯工人委员会全体委员被捕了，并且已经发出传单，号召围绕着伊姆雷·纳吉的问题举行罢工。他说，昨天晚上我们接到了十五次左右的电话，人们问我们决定举行十天的罢工是不是真的。这是挑拨！这位工人还说，话已经说够了，我们需要实际行动。同总理同志讨论过以后，我们取得了一致意见：我们将努力争取使全国的工作完全恢复，因为这不是个人的利益，而是全匈牙利人民的利益。
