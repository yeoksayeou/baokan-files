Philanthropists and Robbers
    Méi Bìhuá
    It is said that in some "civilized" countries, there are robbers who wear masks when they rob. A guilty conscience makes them try to cover up, so as not to be recognized, which is in line with the saying that "even a thief has his principles."

    However, this kind of masked robber is, after all, only a very common tactic, and not worthy of imitation by high-level robbers. Some high-level robbers do wear masks, but not the kind mentioned above, but "high-level" masks, that is, pretending to be "philanthropists," entering people's homes with a look of compassion.

    When the Fascists were killing and setting fires in Budapest, the philanthropists of the "free world" appeared: "Hungary urgently needs plasma, bandages, and medicines..." Then, planes carrying medicines "almost continuously flew in teams from Austrian airports to Budapest." It seemed that they were truly "responsive to every request" philanthropists.

    However, the Austrian newspaper "Volksstimme" revealed: "This is not, as the official news says, the delivery of medicines; if so many planes were used to transport medicines, these medicines would be enough for the whole of Europe." Hey! With just a few words, the philanthropist's trick was exposed: medicines, it turned out, were old officers and soldiers from the Horthy dictatorship, plus West German border guard vehicles, and so on. Why were the philanthropists so "active"? It's truly a matter of "Sima Zhao's intentions are obvious to everyone."

    Speaking of this Horthy, I have to introduce him, even if it means dirtying my pen. Horthy was the dictator of Hungary from 1919 to 1944. This fellow seized power in 1919, with the help of imperialist countries, after subverting the Hungarian Soviet Republic. During the First World War, Horthy was the commander of the Austro-Hungarian Navy, and later became an admiral. Hungary after the war was a landlocked country, so of course there would be no navy. So, how did this admiral show his great military prowess? It turned out that he carried out an extremely cruel white terror against the Communists and working people in Hungary. In this way, this admiral was able to show off his abilities in an ocean of blood.

    The restoration of reactionary elements in Hungary is the restoration of the Horthy Fascists. They dream of re-enacting 1919: pushing the Hungarian people into an ocean of blood.

    However, this year is definitely not 1919. In the blink of an eye, the conspiracy of Horthy's descendants was crushed. Following the elimination of the "relief" objects, the "high-level" mask of the "relief" master was also torn off, and people saw an undisguised robber's face!

    慈善家和强盗
    梅碧华
    据说，在一些“文明”国家里，有一种强盗在行抢的时候是戴上假面具的。作贼心虚，掩饰一下，以免被人识破，这倒也符合“盗亦有道”之说。
    但是，这种戴假面具的强盗，毕竟只能算是极通常的手法，原不足为高明的强盗所仿效。有些高明的强盗固然也戴假面具，却不是上面说的那种假面具，而是“高明”的假面具，就是装成“慈善家”的样子，带着一脸悲天悯人的笑容闯进人家的家里去。
    法西斯分子在布达佩斯杀人放火的时候，“自由世界”里的慈善家们出场了：“匈牙利急需血浆、绷带和药品，……”，接着，装运药品的飞机“几乎是不断地一队队从奥地利机场飞往布达佩斯”。看样子，他们真是“有求必应”的慈善家了。
    然而奥地利“人民之声报”揭露道：“这并不是像官方消息所说的，运送的是药品；如果用这么多飞机运药品，这些药品就会够整个欧洲用的。”嘿！这么寥寥数语，慈善家的勾当就被戳穿了：药品云云，却原来是霍尔蒂专政时代的旧军官和士兵，加上西德边防军的汽车等等。慈善家为什么如此“积极”，真是“司马昭之心，路人皆知”了。
    提起这个霍尔蒂，我还得不辞笔污介绍一下。霍尔蒂是1919年到1944年匈牙利的独裁者。这个家伙是1919年在帝国主义国家帮忙之下，在颠复匈牙利苏维埃共和国之后，窃得政权的。在第一次世界大战中，霍尔蒂是奥匈帝国的海军司令官，后来成为海军上将。大战以后的匈牙利是一个内陆国家，当然不会有海军。那么，这个海军上将又怎样表现其赫赫武功呢？原来他在匈牙利对共产党和劳动人民进行了异常残酷的白色恐怖。就这样，这位海军上将是在血的海洋里逞能的。
    匈牙利反动分子的复辟，就是霍尔蒂法西斯分子的复辟。他们梦想重演1919年：把匈牙利人民推向血的海洋。
    可是，今年到底不是1919年。一转眼功夫，霍尔蒂的后裔们的阴谋被粉碎了。跟着“救济”对象的被肃清，“救济”主的“高明”的假面具也被撕掉了，人们看到的是一付不折不扣的强盗的嘴脸！
