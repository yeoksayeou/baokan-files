    In the War Criminal Prison in Munich
    Feng Zhidan
    The story begins on the evening of November 1, 1956. In a huge prison in Munich, holding Nazi war criminals, the prison guards had finished their dinner and gathered in the prison corridor, discussing the British and French invasion of Egypt. The usually lifeless prison suddenly became active.
    At this moment, on the wall of a cell, in the light, a gloomy shadow appeared, and a person was intently contemplating the evening edition of the Munich newspaper. Suddenly, the shadow on the wall began to gesticulate with the person. Who is this? Readers may have forgotten him, but this person is none other than Rudolf Hess, the successor to Nazi Germany's leader, Hitler. He was sentenced to life imprisonment as a major war criminal after the demise of Nazi Germany and imprisoned here.
    Since Hess was sentenced to life imprisonment, the long prison life and bleak future had kept him frowning and in a bad mood. On this night, he suddenly became excited because he saw in the evening newspaper that Britain and France had issued an ultimatum to Egypt, followed by a large-scale bombing of Cairo and other Egyptian cities by aircraft. Britain and France had begun the war to invade Egypt. At this moment, Hess, as if he had realized something, muttered to himself: "This news is too good, too good, I didn't expect I would be saved!" He looked like he was about to go crazy with joy.
    That night, Hess tossed and turned, unable to sleep. The next day, he concentrated even more on studying the war news printed on page after page of the newspaper. This made Hess feel more and more confident. He believed that the time was indeed ripe. So, he requested the prison authorities to allow him to meet with his defense lawyer, and he also requested the defense lawyer to bring with him the judgment of the Nuremberg International Military Tribunal in 1946, which tried the major German war criminals.
    On November 3, Hess's defense lawyer came to Hess's cell.
    "Mr. Hess, what do you want me for?" the lawyer asked.
    "I ask you to immediately request the relevant parties to release Hess and restore the reputation of all former Nazi German leaders who were executed at the Nuremberg Tribunal in the past, and to declare us innocent again," Hess said with confidence and without any remorse.
    The lawyer was really a bit confused. He thought: Historians have already made a conclusion on the aggressive crimes of Hitler's Germany. Could the case be overturned after ten years?
    However, without waiting for the lawyer to speak, Hess continued:
    "My reasons are very sufficient. What British Prime Minister Eden and French Prime Minister Mollet are doing in Egypt today is exactly what we did in the past." Hess readily took the judgment of the Nuremberg International Military Tribunal in 1946, which tried the major German war criminals, from the lawyer and opened the judgment, pointing to the section on "common plan or conspiracy and aggressive war," saying:
    "Please see, the Nuremberg International Tribunal accused us Nazi Party members of committing the crime of aggression. The judgment says:
  'The indictment in the indictment against the defendants for planning and engaging in aggressive war is an extremely serious charge... Therefore, launching an aggressive war is not just an international crime; it is the greatest international crime, and the difference from other war crimes is only that it contains the sum of all evils.' It can be seen that the war launched by Eden and Mollet against Egypt today is also committing the 'greatest international crime'.
    "Furthermore, the main excuse for Eden and Mollet to invade Egypt today is almost the same as the central slogan we put forward in the past; of course, on this point, I cannot but be proud. The judgment accuses us of annexing Austria in the name of striving for 'living space'. Today, are Britain and France not launching a war in the name of protecting the 'lifeline' in an attempt to seize Egypt's Suez Canal?
    "Yes, the whole world used to scold us as arsonist bandits; but are Eden and Mollet not also setting fires and killing people in the Middle East today? In the past, our planes did indiscriminately bomb Coventry, Paris, and many famous cities in Europe; slaughtering peaceful residents of Europe. But today, are not British and French planes also bombing peaceful towns in Egypt on a large scale and slaughtering peaceful residents of Egypt? In the past, the whole world scolded us for being lawless and disregarding all international law and international morality; but are not Eden and Mollet wantonly trampling on all international law today?"
    Hess became more and more excited, and more and more proud as he spoke, splattering saliva on the defense lawyer's face from time to time.
    "Perhaps some people say," Hess continued: "Mr. Eden calls himself a 'lifelong man of peace'. He said that he wants to fight Egypt in order to 'defend' peace in the Middle East, and Mr. Mollet even said more wonderfully that the British and French armed attack on Egypt 'is not war'! Perhaps Mr. Mollet is saying that Britain and France are playing a children's game with Egypt using airplanes and artillery! From these remarks, it seems that Eden and Mollet are indeed somewhat different compared to my leader Hitler. Yes, I must admit that my leader may not be as hypocritical as Eden and Mollet in terms of hypocrisy; but I think the reason why they are more hypocritical than us is mostly because they are forced by the current situation and have no choice but to do so. In fact, the leader Hitler also talked about peace. Everyone still remembers that the leader Hitler said in his famous speech on the eve of the attack on Poland, 'My love for peace and my infinite patience must not be mistaken for weakness.' Therefore, in a sense, Eden and Mollet are still learning this trick from the leader Hitler."
    Speaking of this, Hess paused for a moment, and then said decisively: "Since Eden and Mollet are not being held in this cell, I and other colleagues of Hitler should obviously not continue to be imprisoned here. We should be declared innocent."
    Then, Hess lowered his voice and said to the defense lawyer with emotion: "Unfortunately, Hitler, Goering, Goebbels, Ribbentrop... some of my colleagues have already died. If they were still alive, they should not have been convicted...."
    After listening to Hess's "brilliant remarks," the lawyer could not but think that Hess's words were reasonable; and considering from the pure legal point of view of a lawyer, he thought that Hess indeed had reason to demand his release.
    So, according to Hess's own opinion, the defense lawyer met with a reporter and raised Hess's request. On November 3, United Press International sent a news item from Munich. The news said:
    "The defense lawyer of Nazi war criminal Rudolf Hess today requested Hess's release, arguing that his crimes are no greater than those of the British and French leaders who attacked Egypt."

    在慕尼黑的战犯监狱里
    冯之丹
    故事开始发生是在1956年11月1日的晚上。在慕尼黑的一座囚禁着纳粹战犯的巨大的监狱里，狱卒们已经用过了晚餐，聚集在监狱的走廊上，谈论着英国和法国进攻埃及的事情。平时死气沉沉的监狱里，突然变得活跃起来。
    这时，在一间牢房的墙壁上，在灯光底下，显出了一个阴森森的黑影，有一个人正在望着当天的慕尼黑晚报凝神沉思。突然，墙上的那个黑影随着这个人手舞足蹈起来。这是谁呢？读者们也许已经把他忘掉了，原来这个人就是当年纳粹德国元首希特勒的继承人鲁道夫·赫斯。他是在纳粹德国复灭后，作为首要战犯被判处无期徒刑而关到这里来的。
    自从赫斯被判处无期徒刑以来，由于长期的监牢生活，渺茫的前途，一直使他愁眉不展，心情恶劣。这天夜里他突然兴奋起来，是因为他在晚报上看到，英国和法国对埃及发出最后通牒，接着便派飞机大举轰炸开罗和埃及的其它城市，英、法开始了进攻埃及的战争。这时，赫斯若有所悟地自言自语说：“这消息太好了，太好了，想不到我有救了！”看样子，他真的高兴得快要发狂了。
    当天晚上，赫斯一直翻来复去不能入睡。第二天，他更聚精会神地研究了报上整页整页登载着的战争消息。这使赫斯觉得越来越有把握，他认为时机的确成熟了。于是，他要求监狱当局允许他会见他的辩护律师，并且要求辩护律师随身把1946年纽伦堡国际军事法庭审判德国首要战犯的判决书带去。
    11月3日，赫斯的辩护律师来到赫斯住的牢房。
    “赫斯先生，要我来有什么事吗？”律师问。
    “我请你立即向有关方面要求释放赫斯和恢复一切过去在纽伦堡法庭上被处决的前纳粹德国领袖们的名誉，重新宣告我们无罪。”赫斯理直气壮、毫无愧色地说。
    这位律师实在有些摸不着头脑。他想：希特勒德国的侵略罪行，历史家已经有了定论，难道十年以后还能翻案吗？
    但是，并不等律师开口，赫斯接着说：
    “我的理由是非常充分的。英国首相艾登和法国总理摩勒今天在埃及干的一套，完全是我们过去干过的。”赫斯顺手从律师那里接过1946年纽伦堡国际军事法庭审判德国首要战犯的判决书，并翻开判决书指着关于“共同计划或阴谋与侵略战争”那一节说：
    “请看，纽伦堡国际法庭控告我们纳粹党徒犯了侵略罪。判决书说：
  ‘起诉书中关于被告们策划并从事侵略战争的控诉是极度严重的控诉……所以发动侵略战争不只是一个国际性罪行；它是最大的国际性罪行，与其他战争罪行的区别，只是它所包含的是全部祸害的总和。’可见，今天艾登和摩勒他们对埃及发动的战争同样是犯了‘最大的国际性罪行’。
    “再说，艾登和摩勒他们今天侵略埃及的主要借口，几乎同我们过去提出的中心口号一样；当然，在这一点上，我不能不引为自豪。判决书指责我们以争取‘生存空间’为名并吞了奥地利，今天英、法不也是以保卫‘生命线’为名企图侵占埃及的苏伊士运河而发动战争的吗？
    “是的，当年全世界都骂我们为纵火的匪徒；但是今天艾登和摩勒不也是在中东放火杀人吗？当年我们的飞机的确滥炸过考文垂、巴黎和欧洲许多著名的城市；屠杀过欧洲和平的居民。可是今天英、法的飞机不也是大举轰炸埃及和平的城镇和屠杀埃及和平的居民吗？当年全世界都骂我们无法无天，无视一切国际公法和国际道义；可是今天艾登和摩勒他们不也是肆无忌惮地践踏一切国际公法吗？”
    赫斯越说越起劲，越说越得意，说得不时把唾沫飞溅到辩护律师的脸上。
    “也许有人说”，赫斯接着讲下去：“艾登先生自称为‘毕生的和平人物’，他说他要打埃及是为了‘保卫’中东的和平，而摩勒先生还要说得妙，他说，英、法对埃及的武装进攻‘不是战争’！也许摩勒先生是说英、法正在用飞机和大炮跟埃及进行着一场儿戏！从这些言论来说似乎艾登、摩勒同我的元首希特勒比较起来确乎有些不同。是的，我必须承在伪善这一点上可能我的元首不如艾登、摩勒；可是我想，他们之所以认，比我们更伪善，多半也是为今天的时势所逼，不能不这样而已。其实，当年希特勒元首也谈论过和平的，大家终还记得，希特勒元首在进攻波兰前夕的那一篇著名的演说中就说过，‘我的爱护和平和我的无穷的忍耐，是不能被误认为软弱的。’因此，在某种意义上说，艾登、摩勒他们的这一种手法也还是从希特勒元首那里学来的呢。”
    说到这里，赫斯停顿了一下，然后断然地说：“艾登和摩勒既然不被押到这个牢房里来，我和其他希特勒的同僚们，显然也不应该继续被囚禁在这里了，我们应该被宣告无罪。”
    然后，赫斯压低声音颇有感慨地对辩护律师说：“可惜希特勒、戈林、戈培尔、里宾特洛甫……我的一些同僚都已经死去了，如果他们还活着，他们也是不应该被判罪的……。”
    这位律师在听了赫斯的“高论”以后，不能不认为赫斯言之成理；并且从律师的纯法律观点来考虑，他想，的确赫斯颇有理由要求释放。
    于是，辩护律师按照赫斯本人的意见，接见了一位记者提出了赫斯的要求。11月3日，合众社便从慕尼黑发出了一则新闻。这则新闻说：
    “纳粹战犯鲁道夫·赫斯的辩护律师今天要求释放赫斯，理由是他的罪行并不比进攻埃及的英、法领袖们大。”
