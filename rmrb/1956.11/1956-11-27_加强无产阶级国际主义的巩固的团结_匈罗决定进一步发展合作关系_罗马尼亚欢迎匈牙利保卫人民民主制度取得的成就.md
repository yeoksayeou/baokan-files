Xinhua News Agency, 26th - According to TASS: Bucharest newspapers published on the 25th a joint communique of the Government of the Romanian People's Republic and the delegation of the Romanian Workers' Party with the Hungarian Revolutionary Worker-Peasant Government and the delegation of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party.

The talks took place in Budapest on November 22. Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej and János Kádár signed the joint communique on behalf of the Romanian and Hungarian delegations respectively.

The communique stated that the talks were conducted in an atmosphere of sincere friendship and mutual understanding. During the talks, the delegations of the two countries exchanged views on the situation caused by the recent Hungarian events and current international issues.

The Romanian delegation expressed its satisfaction with the resolute measures taken by the Hungarian Revolutionary Worker-Peasant Government. The Hungarian Revolutionary Worker-Peasant Government, by taking these measures, quelled the counter-revolutionary rebellion that attempted to overthrow the people's democratic system and restore the landlord-capitalist regime. The Romanian government welcomes with pleasure the efforts made by the Hungarian Revolutionary Worker-Peasant Government to restore law and order in Hungary and to defend the people's democratic system and the social achievements of the working people.

The two governments agreed that if the counter-revolutionary forces were to succeed, Hungary would become a source of war. Undoubtedly, inflammatory chauvinist forces would again sow enmity between the Hungarian and Romanian peoples.

The delegations of the two countries emphasized that in order to eliminate the counter-revolution, to prevent the establishment of a fascist dictatorship, and to defend the democratic and social achievements of the Hungarian people, the Hungarian government's decision to request Soviet military assistance based on sovereignty was necessary and correct.

Based on the United Nations Charter and the principles of the autonomy and independence of all countries, the two governments firmly believe that the future development of Hungary is solely a matter within the jurisdiction of the Hungarian People's Republic. The two governments attach great importance to the United Nations' desire to assist the suffering Hungarian people, but they cannot agree to those United Nations resolutions that do not take into account the Charter and imply interference in Hungary's internal affairs. Restoring law and order and preventing the restoration of fascism is in accordance with Hungary's obligations under the Treaty of Paris and falls entirely within the jurisdiction of the Hungarian government.

The communique reflects the consensus of the two governments on general international issues, including the Anglo-French and Israeli aggression against Egypt, the issue of the United Nations' admission of the People's Republic of China, and the prohibition of the use of atomic energy for military purposes, etc.

The communique went on to say that, based on the interests and will of the two peoples, the two governments expressed their firm determination to enhance and develop selfless friendship and fraternal cooperation in political, economic and cultural life.

The Hungarian Revolutionary Worker-Peasant Government thanked the Romanian people and the Workers' Party for their political and moral support to Hungary, as well as their substantial material assistance. At the request of the Hungarian Revolutionary Worker-Peasant Government, the Romanian government decided to provide Hungary with an additional loan of 60 million rubles, in addition to the previous assistance, to purchase the most necessary commodities.

During the talks, both sides emphasized the need to strengthen cooperation between the Romanian Workers' Party and the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, considering this to be the foundation for strengthening friendship and cooperation between the two countries.

The communique said that the Hungarian events have once again demonstrated that the unbreakable solidarity and unity of socialist countries based on the ideology of proletarian internationalism is a reliable guarantee for the independent and peaceful development of the Romanian and Hungarian peoples, as well as the peoples of other countries in the socialist family. With the support and cooperation of friendly socialist countries, the Hungarian people will surely be able to overcome all difficulties and victoriously move forward along the road of building a happy life, along the road of building socialism.

    加强无产阶级国际主义的巩固的团结
    匈罗决定进一步发展合作关系
    罗马尼亚欢迎匈牙利保卫人民民主制度取得的成就
    新华社26日讯　据塔斯社报道：布加勒斯特的报纸25日刊登了罗马尼亚人民共和国政府和罗马尼亚工人党代表团同匈牙利工农革命政府和匈牙利社会主义工人党代表团会谈的联合公报。
    会谈是11月22日在布达佩斯举行的。乔治乌—德治和卡达尔分别代表罗马尼亚代表团和匈牙利代表团在联合公报上签字。
    公报说，会谈是在真诚友好和互相谅解的气氛中进行的。在会谈当中，两国代表团就最近几周来的匈牙利事件造成的局势以及当前的国际问题交换了意见。
    罗马尼亚代表团对匈牙利工农革命政府采取的一些坚决措施表示满意。匈牙利工农革命政府由于采取这些措施，扑灭了企图推翻人民民主制度和恢复地主资本家政权的反革命叛乱。罗马尼亚政府愉快地欢迎匈牙利工农革命政府为了恢复匈牙利的法制和安宁，以及为了保卫人民民主制度和劳动人民的社会成果所作的努力。
    两国政府一致认为，反革命势力一旦得逞，匈牙利就会变成战争策源地。毫无疑问，煽动性的沙文主义势力又会在匈、罗两国人民之间散布敌意。
    两国代表团着重指出，为了歼灭反革命，为了阻止法西斯专政的建立，为了保卫匈牙利人民的民主和社会成果，匈牙利政府根据主权来请求苏军援助，这一决定是必需的和正确的。
    根据联合国宪章和一切国家自主和独立的原则，两国政府坚决认为，匈牙利今后的发展只是匈牙利人民共和国权限以内的事情。两国政府很重视联合国要援助遭受苦难的匈牙利人民的愿望，但是它们不能同意那些没有考虑到宪章、并且意味着干涉匈牙利内政的联合国决议。恢复法制和防止法西斯主义复辟是符合匈牙利根据巴黎和约所承担的义务的，并且完全属于匈牙利政府的权限。
    公报中反映两国政府对一般国际情势问题的看法是一致的，这些问题有：英法和以色列侵略埃及问题、联合国必须接纳中华人民共和国的问题、禁止把原子能用于军事用途等等。
    公报接着说，根据两国人民的利益和意志，两国政府表示有坚定的决心在政治、经济和文化生活方面增进和发展无私的友谊和兄弟合作关系。
    匈牙利工农革命政府感谢罗马尼亚人民和工人党在政治上和道义上对匈牙利的支持以及大量的物资援助。根据匈牙利工农革命政府的请求，罗马尼亚政府除了以前的援助外，决定再给予匈牙利六千万卢布的贷款以购买最必需的商品。
    在会谈当中，双方着重指出，必须加强罗马尼亚工人党和匈牙利社会主义工人党之间的合作，认为这是加强两国之间的友谊和合作的基础。
    公报说，匈牙利事件再次表明，从无产阶级国际主义观念形态出发的社会主义国家之间的牢不可破的团结一致，是罗、匈两国人民以及社会主义国家大家庭中的其他国家人民的独立与和平发展的可靠保证。在友好的社会主义国家的支持和合作下，匈牙利人民一定能够克服一切困难，胜利地沿着建设幸福生活的道路、沿着建设社会主义的道路向前迈进。
