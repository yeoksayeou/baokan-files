    Several Problems Seen from the Income Distribution of Two Agricultural Cooperatives
    Wang Min, Deputy Secretary of the CPC Dali Prefectural Committee

    The income distribution of the Qianjin Agricultural Production Cooperative in Sutun Township, Yongping County, and the Manjiang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Fengyi County, Yunnan Province, has been largely finalized. The following problems were discovered during the distribution:

    (1) Although income has increased, members still have difficulty making a living. The total income of both cooperatives has increased. The Manjiang Cooperative increased production by 60%, and the Qianjin Cooperative increased production by 30%, and both were able to distribute about 70% of their income to members. In the Manjiang Cooperative, 94.7% of the members increased their income, and in the Qianjin Cooperative, more than 90% of the members increased their income. However, in this situation, some cadres have developed a sense of complacency and are not further investigating the problems in distribution and production. They did not see that although the cooperatives had increased production, the lives of the peasants were still not prosperous. For example, although the Qianjin Cooperative in Yongping distributed 70.6% of its total income to members, a work-day was only worth 46 cents, and the average monthly income per person was only 3.4 yuan. These figures show that the living standards of the peasants are still very low. We have no reason to be satisfied with the status quo and cease striving for progress. We should help agricultural cooperatives develop diversified operations in light of local conditions, implement the policy of running cooperatives diligently and thriftily, and increase the income of members from various sources.

    During the pre-distribution process, it was also discovered that due to subjectivism in leadership, the cooperative's production suffered some losses. The Yongping Sutun Township Agricultural Cooperative suffered losses this year as a result. For example, the planting of dry rice was a first-time trial, but 360 mu were planted at once, and technical guidance was not strengthened, resulting in a loss of more than 140,000 jin in production. In the past, the cooperative planted nearly 100 mu of water chestnuts, which had a market and could generate about 90 yuan per mu. This spring, some cadres believed that water chestnuts were not a staple food and only planted 8 mu, converting the rest to rice, resulting in low yields due to soil damage and a loss of about 7,000 yuan.

    (2) The income of poor peasants is relatively low. The income situation of members of various classes in the Manjiang Cooperative is as follows:

    Class	    Households	Population	Distribution from Cooperative (per person average)	Family Sideline Income (per person average)	Total (per person average)
    Poor Peasants	536	    2232	       73.6 yuan	                                   7.7 yuan	                                   81.3 yuan
    Middle Peasants	224	    1178	       78.9 yuan	                                  12.7 yuan	                                   91.6 yuan
    Former Rich Peasants	44	    223	       84.9 yuan	                                  17.0 yuan	                                  101.9 yuan
    Former Landlords	49	    222	       86.8 yuan	                                  11.0 yuan	                                   97.8 yuan
    Former Small Landlords/Lessees	7	    31	       75.9 yuan	                                  14.8 yuan	                                   90.7 yuan

    In both cooperatives, the income of poor peasants is the lowest; the income of former rich peasants is the highest; and the income of middle peasants and former landlords is roughly equal. According to research, there are five reasons for this situation:

    (1) Poor peasant households have fewer people and less labor than other classes. The number of people and labor situation of each class in the Manjiang Cooperative is as follows:

    Class	    Households	Population	Average Number of People per Household	Average Number of Laborers per Household
    Poor Peasants	536 	2232	        4.1	                                           2.0
    Middle Peasants	224	 1178	        5.2	                                           2.5
    Former Rich Peasants	44	223	        5.0	                                           2.6
    Former Landlords	49	222	        4.5	                                           2.4
    Former Small Landlords/Lessees	7	31	        4.4	                                           2.0

        (Note: Two half-laborers are counted as one full laborer)

    (2) Although the production and income of poor peasants have greatly developed since the land reform, their foundation is still weaker than that of middle peasants, their family sideline income is also less, and coupled with the difficulties in life, some work less in order to find money to support themselves. For example, many poor peasant families in the Qianjin Cooperative in Yongping not only do not raise pigs, but even do not raise a single chicken.

    (3) The cooperative has organized and supervised the production of landlord and rich peasant elements, organized them to reclaim wasteland and participate in water conservancy projects, but has not done enough to help poor peasants work more. Some poor peasants lack pocket money and often have to go to the market for a day just to sell a few eggs or a chicken. After transplanting rice seedlings, some peasants in the Qianjin Cooperative could not work more in order to find pocket money. The cooperative cadres then took two measures to solve this problem: one was to organize landlord and rich peasant elements to work; the other was to increase work points, with some earning about 30 points a day. In this way, poor peasants suffered even more.

    (4) Not enough attention is paid to helping poor peasants develop family sideline occupations. For example, the average family sideline income of poor peasants in the Manjiang Cooperative is only more than 7 yuan per person, while the average for middle peasants is 12 yuan per person, and the average for rich peasant elements is 17 yuan per person. For example, some poor peasants in the Qianjin Cooperative used to earn a lot from lotus roots every year. Most of the dozens of mu of lotus root fields in the township belonged to poor peasants. They should have been left to the poor peasants themselves to manage, but they were also taken over by the cooperative.

    (5) Judging from some scattered situations, some poor peasants have poor production skills and can only engage in simple work, so even if they work a lot, they do not get many work points.

    (3) In this autumn's distribution, in addition to paying attention to the distribution of grain, it is also necessary to pay attention to the distribution of cash. At present, cadres do not pay enough attention to this issue. The Qianjin Cooperative can organize the distribution of cash as follows: more than 24,400 yuan from selling surplus grain; 10,000 yuan from selling flue-cured tobacco; 8,000 yuan from sideline income; 1,200 yuan from Chinese yam income; and more than 3,200 yuan from other income; a total of more than 46,800 yuan. After deducting various expenses, the actual cash participating in the distribution is more than 24,900 yuan, averaging 50 yuan per household. However, in the cash distribution, some cooperative cadres only pay attention to the expansion of reproduction within the cooperative and do not pay enough attention to the lives of the members.

    Judging from the situation of these two cooperatives, it is also very important to mobilize members to hold family meetings, make plans for income and expenditure, and help peasants arrange their lives and spend their money well in the distribution process.

### 从两个农业社的收益分配中看到的几个问题

    从两个农业社的收益分配中看到的几个问题
    中共大理地委副书记　王民
    云南省永平县苏屯乡的前进农业生产合作社、凤仪县满江农业生产合作社，收益分配已大体定案。从分配中发现这样一些问题：
    （一）收入虽有增加，社员生活仍有困难。两个社总收入都增加了。满江社增产60％，前进社增产30％，都能把70％左右的收入分给社员。满江社94.7％的社员增加了收入，前进社增加收入的社员也在90％以上。但在这种情况下，有些干部就发生了满足的情绪，不去进一步深入研究分配中和生产中的问题。他们没有看到合作社虽然增产了，但农民生活还是不富裕的。如永平前进社虽然总收入的70.6％分给了社员，一个劳动日只分四角六分钱，按人口算，每人每月平均只三元四角。从这些数字可以看出农民的生活水平还是很低的。我们没有丝毫理由可以满于现状，不再力求前进。应该因地制宜帮助农业社开展多种经营，贯彻执行勤俭办社方针，从多方面增加社员收入。
    在预分过程中还发现，由于领导上的主观主义，使合作社的生产受到一定损失。永平苏屯乡农业社今年即因此而受到损失。如打旱谷本是初次试种，一下子即种下三百六十多亩，又未加强技术指导，因而造成减产十四万多斤的损失。该社往年种荸荠近一百亩，也有销路，一亩可以收入九十元左右。今春某些干部认为荸荠不是主粮，只种了八亩，其他改种水稻，由于田坏产量很低，损失约七千元左右。
    （二）贫农收入较少。满江社各阶层社员收入情况是：
    阶层　  户数　人口数    从社分红	家庭副业收入  合计			  （每人平均）   （每人平均）
    贫农　  536	   2232　   73.6元　	7.7元	      81.3元
    中农　  224　  1178     78.9元　	12.7元	      91.6元
    原富农　44	   223　    84.9元　    17.0元　      101.9元
    原地主　49　   222　    86.8元　    11.0元　      97.8元
    原小土地 7　   31　     75.9元    　14.8元　      90.7元
    出租者
    两个社都是贫农收入最少；原富农分子收入最多；中农和原地主分子收入大体相等。出现这种情况的原因，据研究有五个原因：
    （1）贫农每户人口和劳动力少于其他阶层。满江社各阶层人数和劳动情况是：
    阶层　户数　人口数　每户平均人数　每户平均劳动力数
    贫农　536 　2232人　4.1人	    　  2.0
    中农　224　 1178人　5.2人　	        2.5
    原富农　44　223人　 5.0人　		2.6
    原地主　49　222人　 4.5人　		2.4
    原小土地 7　31人　  4.4人　		2.0
    出租者
        （注：半劳动力两个折一个整劳动力）
    （2）虽然土地改革后贫农的生产和收入有了很大的发展，但底子仍比中农薄弱，家庭副业也少，加以生活有困难，有些为找钱糊口出工较少。如永平前进社不少贫农家中不但未养猪，甚至连一个鸡都没养。
    （3）合作社作到了组织和监督地主分子、富农分子生产，组织他们开荒、参加水利工程，但是对帮助贫农多出工却作得不够。有些贫农缺零花钱，时常因为卖几个鸡蛋或一只鸡也要赶一天街。前进社在栽秧后有些农民为找零花钱不能多出工，社干部当时曾采取两个办法解决：一是组织地主分子、富农分子出工；二是提高工分，有的一天可得三十分左右。这样，贫农就更加吃亏。
    （4）帮助贫农发展家庭副业注意不够，如满江社贫农家庭副业收入每人平均才七元多，中农则平均每人十二元，富农分子平均每人十七元。又如前进社有的贫农过去每年藕的收入不少，全乡几十亩藕田，多数是贫农的，本来应该仍留给贫农自己经营，也归社了。
    （5）从一些零星情况看，有某些贫农由于生产技术较差，只能从事大路活，就是出工不少得的工分也不多。
    （三）今秋分配中除了要重视对粮食的分配外，还要重视现金的分配。现在干部对这个问题还注意不够。前进社可以组织分配的现金有：卖余粮款二万四千四百多元；卖烤烟款一万元；副业收入八千元；土瓜收入一千二百元；其它收入三千二百多元；共计四万六千八百多元。扣除各项开支，实际参加分配的现金是二万四千九百多元，平均每户可分五十元。但在现金分配上，有些社干部只注意社内扩大再生产，对社员生活却注意不够。
    从这两个社的情况看，在分配过程中，发动社员开家庭会，作收入、支出的打算，帮助农民安排生活把钱花好，也是很重要的。
