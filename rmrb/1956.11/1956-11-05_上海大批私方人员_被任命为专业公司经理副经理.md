They have all demonstrated positive performance and contributions in the socialist transformation.

　　The appointment of private individuals is carried out according to the principle of "using talents to their full potential and providing appropriate consideration." The list of appointed private individuals was first proposed by the Shanghai Federation of Industry and Commerce, and then fully consulted by the relevant government departments with the Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce and the Shanghai Branch of the China Democratic National Construction Association, before being submitted to the Municipal People's Committee for approval. The deliberation and consultation phase lasted for several months.

　　Among the 138 specialized companies in Shanghai, the candidates for private managers or deputy managers of 23 specialized companies are still under consultation. In addition, some technical experts and older representative figures among private individuals will be arranged to serve as consultants to specialized bureaus, chief engineers of specialized companies, and directors of the board of directors.

    上海大批私方人员
    被任命为专业公司经理副经理
    新华社上海31日电　上海市人民委员会在10月29日举行的第二十次会议上，批准任命一百八十九名私方人员为上海市工业、商业、交通运输业等一百零七个专业公司的经理、副经理。其中担任经理职务的有二十一人，担任副经理职务的有一百六十八人。会议上另外提出私方人员十五人，建议中央有关部门任命所属在沪八个专业公司的经理或副经理。
    这批担任专业公司经理、副经理的私方人员，有的是老工商业家，有的是工程师，也有少数民族的工商业者、归国华侨和女工商业者。他们一般都具有相当的技术才能，或者较丰富的管理企业经验。他们在社会主义改造中都曾有积极的表现和贡献。
    任命私方人员工作是按照“量材使用、辅以适当照顾”的原则进行的。被任命的私方人员名单，首先由上海市工商业联合会提出，又经过政府有关部门与市工商联、中国民主建国会上海市分会充分协商，然后提请市人民委员会批准任命。酝酿与协商阶段，前后经过几个月的时间。
    在上海的一百三十八个专业公司中，还有二十三个专业公司的私方经理或副经理人选，现在正在协商中。此外，一部分私方人员中的技术专家和年老的代表性人物，将安排他们担任专业局的顾问、专业公司的总工程师和董事会的董事等职务。
