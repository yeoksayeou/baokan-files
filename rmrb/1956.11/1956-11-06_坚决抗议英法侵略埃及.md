Resolutely Protest Against the Anglo-French Aggression Against Egypt
Editor's Note: This newspaper continues to receive a large number of letters from readers protesting against the armed aggression of Britain and France against Egypt. As of November 5th, this newspaper has received more than a thousand such letters. Due to space limitations, only a portion can be published here.

After seeing the news in the newspaper that Anglo-French imperialist bombs were dropped on Egyptian soil, it aroused our unparalleled anger.

We, together with the peace-loving people of the world, firmly support the just struggle of the Egyptian people for their national independence and territorial integrity, and express our strong condemnation and protest against this heinous and shameful act of Anglo-French imperialism. We demand that the United Nations immediately take measures to cut off the bloody hands of the devils and extinguish the flames of war ignited on Egyptian soil. Historical experience tells us: victory will surely belong to the peace-loving people, and the bloodthirsty warmongers are bound to fail!

After the Anglo-French imperialists instigated Israel to attack Egypt, they brazenly launched a war of aggression against Egypt under the pretext of protecting the Suez Canal, disregarding the just public opinion of the world. This is absolutely not allowed by all peace-loving people in the world. The barbaric act of Britain and France in openly invading Egypt seriously threatens the situation in the Middle East and world peace, and has aroused unparalleled indignation among the Chinese people!

The Chinese people have long been clear about the conspiracies and tricks of the colonialists. As long as we resolutely oppose aggression, the colonialists are destined to fail. The just struggle of the Egyptian people to safeguard national sovereignty and national independence is by no means isolated. Peace-loving people all over the world will strongly support the Egyptian people and condemn the Anglo-French aggression. The final victory belongs to the Egyptian people.

Anglo-French imperialism has frantically launched an armed attack on the Egyptian people. This is a blatant act of aggression! This act of aggression is a challenge to the Egyptian people, as well as to the Asian and African people and the people of the world. This act of aggression, which occurs today when the anti-colonialist struggle of the Asian and African people and the people of the world is surging, shows precisely the dying struggle and shameless dreams of imperialism in its twilight years. It absolutely cannot stop the victory of the heroic Egyptian people in their struggle for national independence.

We Chinese literary and art workers resolutely oppose the bandit behavior of Anglo-French imperialism; we resolutely join the people of the whole country in doing everything possible to support the Egyptian people's just struggle to defend the independence of their motherland!

When most parts of the world were still in a state of ignorance, Egyptian civilization had already emitted brilliant light. Egypt is one of the cradles of human culture! It is the pride of all ethnic groups! Among our colleagues in the Institute of Archaeology, some had done archaeological excavations in Egypt a long time ago, some had just returned from a visit to Egypt recently, and some had read books about Egypt with infinite admiration; we all deeply know that the Egyptian people, like the Chinese people, are the most kind, intelligent, hardworking and brave nation. Now, when the Egyptian people and the people of the world are eager to live a peaceful life, the Anglo-French imperialists have ignited the flames of war on this peaceful land. This war is the most shameful war of aggression in history! We express our infinite indignation at this blatant aggression! We solemnly warn the British and French governments that killing is a crime. What right do you have to impose bombs and death on the workers, students, mothers and children in the streets of Cairo? What right do you have to impose shackles on a nation? We solemnly warn the British and French governments that if you do not wake up in time and stop this crime, the land of Egypt will be your grave! Egyptian brothers, fight bravely! We will always stand with you!

With the conscience of a seminary student, I express my utmost indignation at the evil aggression launched by Anglo-French imperialism against Egypt, and I express my firm support for the just struggle of the Egyptian people against aggression.

Britain and France have imposed war on the Egyptian people, and bloodshed and death are threatening Egyptian men, women and children. The United Nations should uphold justice and actively stop the aggression of Anglo-French imperialism and Israel against Egypt, and put out the burning flames of war.

The people of Britain and France, and all those who invoke the name of Jesus Christ, have a responsibility to stop the war of aggression launched by the British and French governments.

Humanity is forever moving towards civilization, peace and progress. Anyone holding the guns and knives of 19th-century colonialism must quickly put down your weapons. The people of the world will not allow you to run rampant in broad daylight, and God will not forgive you.

    坚决抗议英法侵略埃及
    编者按　本报继续收到大量读者来信，抗议英、法对埃及的武装侵略。至11月5日，本报已收到这样的来信一千多封。因限于篇幅，这里只能选载一部分。
    我们从报纸上看到英、法帝国主义的炸弹投在埃及土地上的消息之后，激起了我们无比的愤怒。
    我们同全世界爱好和平的人民一起，坚决地支持埃及人民为自己的民族独立和领土完整而进行的正义斗争，对英法帝国主义这一穷凶极恶的可耻行为表示强烈的谴责和抗议。我们要求联合国立即采取措施截断魔鬼们的血手，扑灭在埃及土地上燃起的战火。历史的经验告诉我们：胜利一定属于爱好和平的人民，嗜血成性的战争贩子们是一定要失败的！

    英法帝国主义者在唆使以色列进攻埃及以后，以所谓保护苏伊士运河为借口，不顾世界正义的舆论，悍然发动对埃及的侵略战争，是全世界一切爱好和平的人民所决不允许的。英、法公然侵略埃及的野蛮行为，严重地威胁着中东局势和世界和平，激起了我国人民无比的愤慨！
    中国人民对于殖民主义者的阴谋和伎俩是早已清楚的，只要我们坚决地反对侵略，殖民主义者注定是要失败的。埃及人民为了维护国家主权和民族独立的正义斗争绝不是孤立的，全世界爱好和平的人民都会大力支持埃及人民，谴责英法的侵略行动，最后的胜利是属于埃及人民的。
                            北京市工商业联合会
    英法帝国主义已经疯狂的向埃及人民武装进攻了。这是公然的侵略行为！这种侵略行为是向埃及人民，也是向亚非人民及全世界人民的一种挑战。这种侵略行为，发生在亚非人民及全世界人民反殖民主义斗争蓬勃高涨的今天，正显示出帝国主义日暮黄昏穷途末路的垂死挣扎和无耻梦想，它绝对阻止不了英雄的埃及人民争取民族独立斗争的胜利。
    我们中国文学艺术工作者坚决地反对英法帝国主义的强盗行为；坚决地和全国人民一道竭尽一切力量，支援埃及人民保卫祖国独立的正义斗争！
                            中国文学艺术界联合会
    当世界绝大部分地区还处在蒙昧时期的时候，埃及的文明已经发出灿烂的光辉。埃及，是人类文化的摇篮之一！是各族人民的骄傲！在我们考古研究所的同事们当中，有的很早以前就在埃及做过考古发掘工作，有的最近才从埃及访问回来，有的曾经无限惊羡地读过有关埃及的书籍；我们都深深地知道，埃及人民和中国人民一样，是最善良、智慧、勤劳和勇敢的民族。现在，当埃及人民和全世界人民都在渴望着过和平生活的时候，英、法帝国主义者竟然在这块和平的土地上燃起战火。这个战争是历史上最可耻的侵略战争！我们对于这种公然的侵略表示无限的愤慨！我们正告英、法政府，杀人是犯罪的。你们有什么权利将炸弹和死亡强加在开罗街道上的工人、学生、母亲和儿童的头上？你们有什么权利将枷锁强加在一个民族的身上？我们正告英、法政府，你们假若不及时猛醒，停止这种罪行，埃及的土地就是你们的坟墓！埃及的弟兄们，勇敢地战斗吧！我们永远和你们站在一起！
        中国科学院考古研究所
            郑振铎　尹达　夏鼐　徐旭生等六十人
    我本着一个神学生的良心，对英、法帝国主义向埃及所发动的罪恶侵略，表示万分愤慨，对埃及人民所坚持的反侵略的正义斗争，表示坚决支持。
    英法两国已把战争强加在埃及人民的头上，流血与死亡在威胁着埃及的男女和儿童。联合国应当主持公道，积极阻止英法帝国主义以及以色列对埃及的侵略，扑灭燃烧起来的战争火焰。
    英法两国人民以及一切奉基督耶稣的名的人，都有责任制止英法政府所发动的侵略战争。
    人类永远朝向文明、和平与进步。任何拿着十九世纪殖民主义枪刀的人，必须快快放下你们的凶器。全世界人民是不允许你们在光天化日之下横行霸道的，上帝也不会饶恕你们的。
