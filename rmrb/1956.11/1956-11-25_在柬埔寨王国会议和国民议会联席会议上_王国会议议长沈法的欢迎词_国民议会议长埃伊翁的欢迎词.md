Mr. Prime Minister:

　　Today, as Your Excellency graces Cambodian soil for the first time on an official visit and brings us the greatest honor, allow me to extend, on behalf of the Royal Council and myself, our sincere welcome and to convey the brotherly greetings of the Cambodian people to the people of the People's Republic of China.

　　Your Excellency's visit to Cambodia today, following the invitation and visit of Prince Sihanouk to the People's Republic of China, holds significant meaning for the rekindling of the historical relations between the two nations of China and Cambodia, a relationship that had been altered for a time by the vicissitudes of history over the centuries.

　　Undoubtedly, it is to further enhance the friendly ties between our two countries that the People's Republic of China has generously provided aid to our nation, enabling us to utilize this assistance to improve the living standards of our people.

　　We are deeply moved by this generous gesture. If this expression is sufficient to strengthen the mutual friendship between our two countries, it will also enable Cambodia to organize itself into a truly independent nation.

　　However, this possibility can only be realized if Cambodia strives to safeguard peace at all times and in all places, for one absolutely cannot build amidst turmoil. Therefore, for this reason, the entire Cambodian people, under the guidance of Prince Sihanouk, the father of independence, has adopted a policy of absolute neutrality between the two major camps, which may affect the current world peace due to differing views on democracy.

　　Similarly, in order to complete domestic construction, the Kingdom of Cambodia believes that joining the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence is an absolutely wise move. These five principles were initiated by Your Excellency and Indian Prime Minister Nehru and are absolutely adhered to by us. As the world is currently in a period of turbulence, we hope that all countries can sincerely understand the moral spirit of these noble principles.

　　Therefore, Mr. Prime Minister, your visit gives us the greatest hope. Considering Your Excellency's position as the most respected figure in the current international arena, these principles will undoubtedly become the sacred dogma for the countries participating in them and a discipline respected by other countries as well. Mr. Prime Minister:

　　When Prince Sihanouk, the father of Cambodian independence, visited your country, he received a unanimous, warm, and cordial reception from your people. The grand welcome ceremony and sincere concern moved all of us in Cambodia immensely and filled us with unparalleled honor. Since then, we have been waiting moment by moment for Your Excellency to visit the Kingdom of Cambodia.

　　Now our expectations have finally been realized. Today, this great day, should occupy a glorious page in the history of our Kingdom of Cambodia, for Your Excellency's gracious visit symbolizes that the friendly relations between Cambodia and China will be further consolidated and developed.

　　People should not forget that the traditional relationship between our two countries, Cambodia and China, has been closely maintained continuously since the Middle Ages. This friendship did suffer some damage due to the provocation and alienation by colonialists, but now, this conspiracy of provocation has been completely shattered thanks to the victorious struggle for independence made by Prince Sihanouk at the end of 1953. From today onwards, in order to safeguard world peace, the Kingdom of Cambodia is willing to firmly hold the hand of friendship with all countries in the world, especially with China, regardless of skin color, race, or political line, as long as these countries can respect the policy of neutrality and not exceed the scope of the Bandung Conference resolutions.

　　Mr. Prime Minister, the policy of neutrality is the desire of all Cambodian people. Therefore, the Cambodian people actively seek to make beneficial contributions to peace, because from the historical or geographical point of view of Cambodia, only a policy of neutrality can bring peace and stability to its country, to all countries, and to the world.

　　Mr. Prime Minister, I, in the name of the President of the National Assembly and all members of the National Assembly, representing the people of the whole country, express my deep gratitude to Your Excellency and your comrades for the selfless assistance that China has given to Cambodia.

　　At the same time, please convey our sincere blessings to Chairman Mao Zedong and all the Chinese people!

    在柬埔寨王国会议和国民议会联席会议上
    王国会议议长沈法的欢迎词　国民议会议长埃伊翁的欢迎词总理先生：
    当着阁下首次光临柬埔寨国土作正式访问并给我们带来最大的荣誉的今天，请允许我以王国会议的名义以及我本人名义向阁下谨致欢迎的敬意，并向中华人民共和国人民致柬埔寨人民兄弟般的敬礼。
    阁下在西哈努克亲王应邀到中华人民共和国访问后，在今天命驾柬埔寨访问，是有着重系柬中两民族之间久已间断的历史关系的意义，而这种千百年的关系曾经一度遭受到历史变迁而有所改变。
    毫无疑义，正是为了两国间的友谊联系的更加增长，中华人民共和国才给予我国仁慈的援助，使我国能利用这种援助来提高人民生活水平。
    对于这个慷慨的表示，我们深深地感动。如果说，这种表示足以用来加强我们两国间相互的友谊，那末它同时也能使柬埔寨用来把自己组织成为一个真正独立的国家。
    但这种可能性只有当柬埔寨随时随地能努力维护和平才能实现，因为人们绝对不能在变乱中建设的。所以为了这个理由，全柬埔寨人民才在独立之父西哈努克亲王的指导下，采取了对两大阵营间的绝对中立政策，后者因为对民主主义的见解有分歧而可能影响当前世界的和平。
    同样的，为了完成国内的建设，柬埔寨王国认为加入和平共处的五项原则是绝对明智之举，这五项原则是由总理阁下同印度总理尼赫鲁先生所发起，而为我们所绝对遵守的。当目前世界正处在动荡的时期中，我们将寄望于各个国家能诚恳地了解这种崇高原则的道义精神。
    所以，总理阁下，你的光临访问给予我们最大的希望。以阁下在当前国际上最有声誉的伟人地位来说，这种原则无疑地将成为参加该原则的国家的神圣教条，也将成为其他国家所尊重的纪律。总理先生：
    当柬埔寨独立之父、西哈努克亲王访问贵国的时候，曾经得到贵国人民一致热烈和亲切的招待，那种隆重的欢迎仪式和真诚的关切，使我们全柬埔寨人民无限感动和引为无上光荣，从那时起，我们就时时刻刻等候阁下能光临柬埔寨王国访问。
    现在我们的期待终于实现了。今天这个伟大的日子是应该在我们柬埔寨王国历史上占有辉煌的一页的，因为阁下的惠然光临正象征着柬中两国的友好联系将更加巩固和发展。
    人们应不会遗忘的是：我们柬中两国历史上的传统关系自中世纪以来就是一直不断地密切保持着的。这种友谊确曾受到殖民主义者的挑拨离间而蒙受到一些损害，但现在，这种挑拨离间的阴谋，由于1953年底西哈努克亲王所作的争取独立的英勇奋斗得到胜利后而宣告全部破产了。从今天起，为了维护世界和平，柬埔寨王国愿坚决地和世界上各国特别是和中国紧携友谊之手，不分肤色种族，不论政治路线，只要这些国家能够尊重中立政策和不超越万隆会议决议的范围。
    总理先生，中立政策是柬埔寨全民的愿望。因此，柬埔寨人民积极地寻求对和平作有益的贡献，因为在柬埔寨的历史观点上或地理观点上，只有中立政策才能为它的国家，为各国，为世界带来和平和安定。
    总理先生，我谨以国民议会议长名义及全体国民议会议员名义，代表着全国人民，向阁下以及阁下的同志们，对中国给予柬埔寨的无私援助致深深的谢意。
    同时也敬请阁下向毛泽东主席和全中国人民转致我们诚恳的祝福！
