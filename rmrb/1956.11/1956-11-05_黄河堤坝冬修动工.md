Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: As the Yellow River flood season is about to end, the Yellow River dike winter repair project began around October 20th.

The Jinan section of the Yellow River dike winter repair project started on October 5th, and the sections in various counties along the river have also started one after another. Currently, most county sections have started, except for a few that need to start later at the end of the month. More than 60,000 migrant workers in Henan and Shandong provinces have been投入 into this project along the main stream and tributaries of the Yellow River. It is expected that the entire project will be completed before the river freezes.

This year's Yellow River dike winter repair project involves nearly five million cubic meters of earthwork. It includes raising and repairing, as well as reinforcing and repairing, the dikes below Luokou on the Yellow River and parts of the dikes of its tributaries, the Qin River and the Daqing River.
