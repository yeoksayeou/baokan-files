Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 24th. The Bailong River channel management project in Gansu Province has commenced. According to the person in charge of the transportation department, after the dredging this winter and spring, small steamships will be able to navigate the Bailong River in the second quarter of next year.

　　The Bailong River belongs to the Jialing River system, with little sand content, large flow, and does not freeze all year round. It is the best waterway in Gansu Province suitable for navigation. The Bailong River flows through the Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture and the Wuwei Special District. Both sides of the river have the Bailong River Forest Area, covering an area of hundreds of thousands of hectares, the Longjiagou Coal Mine with abundant reserves, and also produces large quantities of grain, medicinal materials, native products, and livestock products. After the Bailong River is navigable, the backward transportation situation here can be changed, the rich resources can be developed, and the lives of the Tibetan and Han people can be improved.

　　On the inland waterways of Gansu Province, where only sheepskin rafts and wooden boats have traveled to and fro, steamships will soon be seen for the first time.

    小轮船将行驶在白龙江上
    新华社兰州24日电　甘肃境内白龙江河道治理工程已经动工。据交通部门负责人谈，经过今冬明春的整治，明年第二季度白龙江就可以行驶小型轮船。
    白龙江属嘉陵江水系，含沙少，流量大，终年不冻，是甘肃省可以通航的最好河道。白龙江流过甘南藏族自治州和武都专区，两岸有面积达几十万公顷的白龙江林区，有储量丰富的龙家沟煤矿，还出产大宗的粮食、药材、土产和畜产品。白龙江通航以后，这里交通闭塞的状况可以改变，丰富的资源可以着手开发，同时可以改善藏、汉两族人民的生活。
    从来只有一些羊皮筏子和木船来往的甘肃省内河航道上，不久可以第一次看到轮船了。
