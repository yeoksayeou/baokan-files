Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 29th. This year, over 17,000 reformed vagrants in Shanghai have taken up jobs. The majority of them have returned to their hometowns to engage in production, while over 6,000 have gone to work in various factories and enterprises in Shanghai and volunteered to participate in socialist construction in places like Anhui, Gansu, and Tibet.

　　These vagrants, after a period of ideological education and labor training, have gradually shed their habits of idleness and laziness, and are eager to become working citizens. For example, Wang Wenfu, a long-term opium addict, and Lü Haishan, who came from a hooligan background, have transformed into physically strong people who love labor, and they have both received awards for their work. In June of this year, over 3,000 reformed vagrants went to Anhui to participate in the Huai River project. They fought against the flood for three days and three nights, completed the tasks of protecting the dikes and helping farmers to rescue wheat, and received commendations from the Huai River project authorities.

    从此自立作新人
    上海今年一万七千多游民走上工作岗位
    新华社上海29日电　上海市今年有一万七千多个经过改造的游民走上了工作岗位。其中大部分是回乡生产，并有六千多人到上海各工厂、企业等单位工作和志愿去安徽、甘肃、西藏等地参加社会主义建设。
    这些经过一定时期的思想教育和劳动锻炼的游民，逐步革除了游惰习性，纷纷要求做个劳动的公民。如长期吸食毒品的王文富和流氓出身的吕海山，已经变成了体格强壮、喜爱劳动的人，他们都在工作中得到了奖励。今年6月，有三千多个经过改造的游民到安徽参加治淮工作。他们曾经和洪水斗争了三昼夜，完成了护堤和帮助农民抢救小麦的任务，得到了治淮机关的表扬。
