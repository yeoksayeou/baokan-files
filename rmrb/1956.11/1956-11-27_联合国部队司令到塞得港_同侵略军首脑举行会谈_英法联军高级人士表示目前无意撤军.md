Xinhua News Agency, November 26th, Cairo Dispatch: UN Emergency Force Commander Burns arrived in Port Said from Cairo on the 25th and held talks with senior commanders of the British and French aggressor forces.

Participating in the talks were Lieutenant General Keightley, Commander-in-Chief of the British and French Allied Forces, Vice Admiral Barjot, Deputy Commander-in-Chief, and Lieutenant General Stockwell, Commander of the forces stationed in Egypt. They held talks for approximately two hours at Lieutenant General Stockwell's office, which was guarded.

Stockwell later told reporters that the talks did not discuss the UN resolution demanding the immediate withdrawal of British and French troops. According to him, the talks were "very friendly" and they discussed three main issues. These three issues were: the mission of the UN forces stationed in Port Said; the arrival of the Yugoslav battalion in the UN forces; and the use of Port Said to transport supplies and equipment for the UN forces. He said that the talks were limited to military issues and did not discuss political issues. "The talks also did not discuss any dates or plans for withdrawal."

Xinhua News Agency, November 26th: According to a United Press International dispatch from Nicosia, a senior official at the headquarters of the British and French aggressor allied forces stated on November 24th that the British and French aggressor forces currently have no intention of withdrawing from Egypt.

He said that the British and French forces would not withdraw from the canal zone until the UN Emergency Force controlled the entire Suez Canal. Only when the British and French believe that the UN forces are sufficient to carry out their responsibilities can the complete withdrawal of the allied forces be considered. He believes that the currently planned total of 4,000 UN troops is insufficient.

    联合国部队司令到塞得港
    同侵略军首脑举行会谈
    英法联军高级人士表示目前无意撤军
    新华社26日讯　开罗消息：联合国紧急部队司令伯恩斯在25日从开罗到达塞得港，同英法侵略军的高级司令官举行了会谈。
    参加会谈的有英法联军总司令凯特莱中将、副总司令巴尔若海军中将、驻埃及部队司令司托克威尔中将。他们在有警卫把守的司托克威尔中将的办公处，举行了约有两个小时的会谈。
    司托克威尔后来对记者说，这次会谈并没有讨论联合国所通过的要求英法军队立即撤退的决议。据他说，会谈是“非常友好的”，他们讨论了三个主要问题。这三个问题是：驻塞得港的联合国部队的任务；联合国部队中的南斯拉夫营到达的问题；利用塞得港运送联合国部队的供应品和装备问题。他说，会谈限于军事问题，没有讨论政治问题。“会谈也没有讨论关于撤退的任何日期或计划”。
    新华社26日讯　据合众社尼科西亚消息：英法侵略联军总部一个高级人士11月24日表示，英法侵略军目前无意撤出埃及。
    他说，不等到联合国紧急部队控制整个苏伊士运河，英法部队不撤出运河区。只有在英法认为联合国部队足够执行它们的职责的时候，才能够考虑全部撤退联军的问题。他认为目前所计划的总数为四千人的联合国部队是不够的。
