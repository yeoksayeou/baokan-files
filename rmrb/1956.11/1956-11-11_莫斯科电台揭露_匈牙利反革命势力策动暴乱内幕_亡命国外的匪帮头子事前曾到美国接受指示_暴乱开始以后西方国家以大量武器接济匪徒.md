Xinhua News Agency, 10th. Moscow Radio broadcast on the 9th that reliable sources from Vienna said: Shortly before the outbreak of the Hungarian riots, the senior leaders of Hungarian exiles, headed by Ferenc Nagy, held a meeting in Munich. Ferenc Nagy told the participants that a leadership center for the preparation of a national coup had been formed in Budapest, with himself, Horthy, Kovács, and others participating, and that considerable preparatory work had been carried out. Nagy told the participants that he had recently returned from the United States, where their detailed plan had been agreed upon by the highest authorities, and that he had worked out a more detailed plan with certain American agencies to transport weapons and personnel to Hungary. Subsequently, Hungarian counter-revolutionaries immediately began to receive substantial assistance from the West when they launched the riots. They stepped up the use of aircraft to drop saboteurs, counter-revolutionaries, and provocateurs into Hungary.

According to reliable sources, in the first few days of the riots in Budapest, many cars full of people drove through Vienna and other Austrian cities towards the eastern border of Austria. The people in the cars spoke Hungarian and wore American-style military uniforms. Military and civilian aircraft, under the pretext of transporting medicines and supplies to Hungarian hospitals, transported large quantities of weapons, including pistols, grenades, automatic rifles, and machine guns, to Vienna. These weapons were then shamelessly transferred to Hungary in cars flying the Red Cross flag. In addition, an air transport line was established between Munich and Hungarian cities near the Austrian border to parachute the Horthy and Szálasi bandits from West Germany into Hungary. This transport line was most active at night.

The news pointed out that the work of dropping saboteurs, weapons, radios, and propaganda materials was directly directed by the leaders of the American "Crusade for Freedom" and the "Committee for the Struggle for Freedom in Europe." Thus, during the riots, all the war criminals and arrogant fascists who had fled after 1946 for fear of popular revenge returned to Hungary. In addition to the armed fascist bandits, many landlords, factory owners, and representatives of the Horthy faction, who had committed heinous crimes among the people, were also dropped into Hungary. After arriving in Hungary, the Horthy bandits obtained large amounts of money from the Hungarian People's Republic and foreign currency. Prince Eszterházy, a large landowner and military criminal released from prison by the Horthy fascist rioters, told foreign journalists in Budapest that he would occupy a prominent position in the government and would do his best to quickly restore the old land ownership system in the Hungarian countryside.

According to eyewitnesses, many leaflets calling for the organization of counter-revolutionary riots and white terror actions were scattered in many cities and villages in Hungary. These leaflets were distributed at night from airplanes using special balloons, as well as by provocateurs and terrorists.

    莫斯科电台揭露
    匈牙利反革命势力策动暴乱内幕
    亡命国外的匪帮头子事前曾到美国接受指示  暴乱开始以后西方国家以大量武器接济匪徒
    新华社10日讯　据莫斯科电台9日广播：从维也纳得到的可靠的消息说：在匈牙利暴动开始前不久，以费伦茨·纳吉为首的匈牙利亡命者高级领导人曾经在慕尼黑举行了会议。费伦茨·纳吉向参加会议的人说，当时在布达佩斯已经组成了有他本人、霍尔蒂、科瓦奇以及其他人参加的准备国家政变的领导中心，并且进行了相当的准备工作。纳吉向参加会议的人说，他不久前才从美国回来，他们的详细计划在那里曾经取得最高机关的协议，他曾经和美国的某些机关制订了运输武器和人员到匈牙利去的更详细的计划。随后，匈牙利反革命分子在发动暴动时立刻就开始从西方获得大量的援助。他们加紧用飞机向匈牙利投掷破坏分子、反革命分子和挑拨分子。
    据可靠的消息说，当布达佩斯开始暴动的最初几天，许多汽车满载着人通过维也纳和其他奥地利的城市，向着奥地利的东方国境开去，汽车上的人说匈牙利话，穿着美式军服。军用飞机和民用飞机，借口给匈牙利医院运送药品和给养，把大批的武器，其中包括手枪、手榴弹、自动枪和机关枪运送到维也纳去。这些武器后来竟无耻地被打着红十字会旗子的汽车很快地转运到匈牙利去。此外，为了把霍尔蒂、萨拉希强盗分子从西德空投到匈牙利去，在慕尼黑和靠近奥地利边境的匈牙利城市之间建立了空中运输线。这个运输线在夜晚活动得最厉害。
    消息指出，投掷破坏分子、武器、无线电机和宣传材料的工作是由美国“争取自由十字军”和“争取自由欧洲斗争委员会”的领导人直接指挥的。这样，在进行暴乱期间，所有在1946年以后由于害怕人民报仇而逃跑的军事罪犯和狂妄的法西斯分子又都回到匈牙利来了。除了武装的法西斯强盗以外，还在匈牙利投掷了许多地主、工厂主以及在民间罪恶滔天的霍尔蒂派的代表人物。霍尔蒂匪徒们到达了匈牙利之后获得大量的匈牙利人民共和国的钱和外国货币。由霍尔蒂法西斯暴乱者从监牢里放出来的军事犯、大地主艾斯比尔哈齐亲王向布达佩斯的外国记者说，他将在政府占有一个显要的位置，他将尽力迅速在匈牙利乡村恢复旧有的土地所有制。
    据亲眼看见的人说，在匈牙利许多城市，乡村里都撒下了许多号召组织反革命暴乱和白色恐怖行动的传单，这些传单是由飞机上利用专门的气球在夜晚散发下来的，以及由那些挑衅分子和恐怖分子散发的。
