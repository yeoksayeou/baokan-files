Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, November 17th: Indian Prime Minister Nehru made a statement in the Lok Sabha (People's House) of the Indian Parliament on November 16th regarding the situation in Egypt and Hungary.

In his statement, Nehru emphasized that British, French, and Israeli troops should completely withdraw from Egyptian territory and pointed out that the nature of the events in Egypt and Hungary were different.

The statement said that after the nationalization of the Suez Canal Company, India had been watching the policies of the United Kingdom government and the French government with extreme concern. In particular, the concentration of troops and aircraft for military action in Egypt seemed to us to be a restoration of past colonial methods and a suppression of Egypt through a display of armed force. Indeed, the politicians responsible in the United Kingdom and France had said that the Egyptian regime must be changed, especially that the head of the Egyptian state and government should step down. But we had hoped that after the Security Council passed a resolution (on the Suez Canal issue), a more peaceful approach would be taken to resolve this dispute. Therefore, the military action taken by the United Kingdom and France against Egypt, especially the bombing of parts of Cairo and other places in Egypt, not only deeply shocked the Indian people, but also shocked other countries, including many in the United Kingdom. This seemed to be a blatant example of aggression by two powerful countries against a relatively weak country, with the aim of forcibly implementing their will, even to the point of changing the government of that country. This aroused a universal reaction around the world to the actions of Britain and France. Because the United Kingdom and France exercised their veto power, the Security Council lost its effectiveness, and the United Nations General Assembly, at an emergency meeting, expressed its disagreement with this action and demanded the cessation of military operations in Egypt, as well as the withdrawal of the armed forces of Israel, France, and the United Kingdom from Egyptian territory. Then an unstable ceasefire was achieved. The United Kingdom, France, and Israel had announced that they would withdraw their armed forces, although they indicated that this would be subject to certain conditions.

These developments gave some hope that peaceful methods could be used in the future. A few days ago, I ventured to say that the situation had improved slightly. Today, I am not at all sure whether this improvement has taken place. There are many trends which, unless stopped, could rapidly deteriorate the situation and resume the war. If, unfortunately, military action starts again, then the area of expansion may be much larger than it is now, and it may even develop into a major war.

The statement said that despite the resolutions passed by the United Nations General Assembly, sporadic fighting continues to occur, and there is no intention to withdraw troops from Egyptian territory. Indeed, these troops seem to have gained a foothold on Egyptian territory and currently have no intention of leaving. If these foreign troops continue to remain on Egyptian territory, the situation could rapidly deteriorate, and the danger of new military action would be closer.

Although the United Kingdom government and France ostensibly accepted the United Nations resolutions, they put forward certain conditions that did not conform to that resolution. The Israeli Prime Minister still insists that he will never withdraw from Gaza. If foreign troops are not completely withdrawn from Egyptian territory, this is tantamount to a flagrant violation of United Nations resolutions.

The statement announced that India had agreed to send its own armed forces to participate in the United Nations international force, which is scheduled to leave India by plane on November 16th. The United Nations force will not be related to the Suez Canal issue itself, which can only be considered separately after peace is fully established and all foreign troops have withdrawn. It is said that the main task of this international force is to ensure that Israel remains behind the demarcation line stipulated in the old armistice agreement.

News carried in the newspapers does not indicate that the fighting in and around Port Said is fierce. We have received some news about this battle, which indicates that the casualties are mainly Egyptian civilians, and the casualties are very large, reaching several thousand. The difficult situation in Port Said is very serious. We are taking urgent steps to send a large number of medicines to Egypt by special plane for relief.

The statement said that the past three and a half months since the nationalization of the Suez Canal Company have been filled with tragedy, and what has happened seems to me simply impossible in the present era. I find it somewhat difficult to deal with this record of blatant aggression and deception. The explanations offered from time to time are often contradictory, and the attitude towards things displayed by these explanations is dangerous to the freedom of Asian and African countries and to world peace itself. It has brought pain and disaster, hatred and hostility, and no benefit whatsoever. In addition, we are now under the threat of a possible world war.

Throughout the disputes since the nationalization of the Suez Canal Company, Egypt has always adopted a fairly proper and patient attitude. Without any legitimate reason, Egypt was not only attacked by Israel, but also by the United Kingdom and France. I do not know whether any consultations were conducted in advance between the aggressor countries. However, it is obvious that their plans were coordinated. The British and French offensive helped Israel's aggression, and it itself was helped by Israel's aggression. Egypt was immediately attacked by the armed forces of the United Kingdom and France after being invaded by Israel. Only after it aroused widespread popular anger not only in Asia and Africa but also in Europe and the Americas, and after the United Nations took action, was this aggression stopped to some extent. But, in my opinion, there is now a trend of complacency and laissez-faire after the implementation of the ceasefire. In fact, some attempts have even been made to downplay and justify this completely unwarranted and brutal attack on Egypt. To some extent, attention has been diverted to the serious and unfortunate events that have occurred in Hungary.

The statement said that although both events deserve serious attention, their nature is different.

The statement said that from the beginning, we have made it clear that we believe that the Hungarian people should be allowed to decide their own future according to their wishes, and that foreign troops should withdraw. This view has been and remains our fundamental view on the Hungarian issue.

The United Nations General Assembly passed a proposal on the Hungarian issue submitted by Pakistan, Cuba, Italy, Peru, and Ireland. We voted against this proposal. Because people have raised some criticisms about our voting against this proposal, I hope to clear up any misunderstandings that may arise. We believe that the wording of this proposal is inappropriate. However, the most unsatisfactory part of this proposal is that it requires elections to be held in Hungary under the supervision of the United Nations. We firmly oppose this because we believe that this violates the Charter and would degrade Hungary to the point of not being a sovereign state. We believe that agreeing to this form of interference and elections held under foreign supervision would create a bad precedent that could be used in the future to interfere in other countries. This proposal was voted on section by section. We abstained from voting on all other parts of this proposal. We voted against the section on holding elections under the supervision of the United Nations. When the entire proposal, including this section, was put to a vote, we also voted against it because of the section we strongly opposed.

This voting attitude towards this proposal is completely consistent with our country's general policy and instructions. In our opinion, this proposal, apart from one part that we fundamentally oppose, is of no help whatsoever to the Hungarian issue.

The statement also said that we are making arrangements to transport relief supplies to Hungary as soon as possible.

The statement concluded by saying that the world is now facing great danger. Perhaps the small-scale wars we have seen are only the first round, and larger wars are ahead. In particular, the ambitions of strong countries threaten weaker countries. The only hope lies in the United Nations, representing the world family, being able to end power politics and replace it with a more civilized way of handling problems. Today's choice is between the hydrogen bomb and Panchsheel.

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, November 17th: According to the Indian Press Trust, Indian Prime Minister Nehru told the Congress Parliamentary Party on November 15th that the crisis in West Asia has not passed. The situation largely depends on the outcome of the talks between the Egyptian authorities and UN Secretary-General Hammarskj√∂ld in Cairo in a day or two on the specific responsibilities of the UN international force.

Nehru told the members of the Congress Parliamentary Party that even if the current situation in West Asia does not worsen and shows improvement, it will take almost three months to reopen the Suez Canal. The closure of the Suez Canal has a serious impact on India, and some issues related to the implementation of India's Second Five-Year Plan may have to be reconsidered.

He reiterated the view that Bulganin's warning letters to the British Prime Minister and the French Prime Minister seemed to be directly related to the subsequent ceasefire.

When talking about the Hungarian issue, Nehru said that the Soviet Union believes that it was justified for the Soviet army to re-enter Budapest after its initial withdrawal on October 30th. The reason the Soviet Union held was partly that armed foreigners had crossed the border into Hungary and, together with others, began a massacre.

He said that India supports the demand that Soviet troops should withdraw from Hungary and that the Hungarian people should be given complete freedom to choose their own government. However, India opposes the suggestion that elections in that country should be held under the auspices of the United Nations. This would be a dangerous precedent, especially from the viewpoint of small countries.

Nehru, speaking to Indonesian journalists on the evening of November 14th about the relationship between the Hungarian events and Western countries, pointed out that Western countries had sent thousands of propaganda balloons to Hungary and dropped millions of propaganda pamphlets there. When the Hungarian riots reached their climax, the borders of Hungary were wide open, and many former Hungarian exiles re-entered Hungary. Nehru also mentioned the radio broadcasts that Western countries broadcast specifically to Hungary.
