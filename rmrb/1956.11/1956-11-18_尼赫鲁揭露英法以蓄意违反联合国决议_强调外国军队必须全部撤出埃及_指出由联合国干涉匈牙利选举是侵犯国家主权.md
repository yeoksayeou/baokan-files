Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, November 17th: Indian Prime Minister Nehru made a statement in the Lok Sabha (People's House) of the Indian Parliament on November 16th regarding the situation in Egypt and Hungary.

In his statement, Nehru emphasized that British, French, and Israeli troops should completely withdraw from Egyptian territory and pointed out that the nature of the events in Egypt and Hungary were different.

The statement said that after the nationalization of the Suez Canal Company, India had been watching the policies of the United Kingdom government and the French government with extreme concern. In particular, the concentration of troops and aircraft for military action in Egypt seemed to us to be a restoration of past colonial methods and a suppression of Egypt through a display of armed force. Indeed, the politicians responsible in the United Kingdom and France had said that the Egyptian regime must be changed, especially that the head of the Egyptian state and government should step down. But we had hoped that after the Security Council passed a resolution (on the Suez Canal issue), a more peaceful approach would be taken to resolve this dispute. Therefore, the military action taken by the United Kingdom and France against Egypt, especially the bombing of parts of Cairo and other places in Egypt, not only deeply shocked the Indian people, but also shocked other countries, including many in the United Kingdom. This seemed to be a blatant example of aggression by two powerful countries against a relatively weak country, with the aim of forcibly implementing their will, even to the point of changing the government of that country. This aroused a universal reaction around the world to the actions of Britain and France. Because the United Kingdom and France exercised their veto power, the Security Council lost its effectiveness, and the United Nations General Assembly, at an emergency meeting, expressed its disagreement with this action and demanded the cessation of military operations in Egypt, as well as the withdrawal of the armed forces of Israel, France, and the United Kingdom from Egyptian territory. Then an unstable ceasefire was achieved. The United Kingdom, France, and Israel had announced that they would withdraw their armed forces, although they indicated that this would be subject to certain conditions.

These developments gave some hope that peaceful methods could be used in the future. A few days ago, I ventured to say that the situation had improved slightly. Today, I am not at all sure whether this improvement has taken place. There are many trends which, unless stopped, could rapidly deteriorate the situation and resume the war. If, unfortunately, military action starts again, then the area of expansion may be much larger than it is now, and it may even develop into a major war.

The statement said that despite the resolutions passed by the United Nations General Assembly, sporadic fighting continues to occur, and there is no intention to withdraw troops from Egyptian territory. Indeed, these troops seem to have gained a foothold on Egyptian territory and currently have no intention of leaving. If these foreign troops continue to remain on Egyptian territory, the situation could rapidly deteriorate, and the danger of new military action would be closer.

Although the United Kingdom government and France ostensibly accepted the United Nations resolutions, they put forward certain conditions that did not conform to that resolution. The Israeli Prime Minister still insists that he will never withdraw from Gaza. If foreign troops are not completely withdrawn from Egyptian territory, this is tantamount to a flagrant violation of United Nations resolutions.

The statement announced that India had agreed to send its own armed forces to participate in the United Nations international force, which is scheduled to leave India by plane on November 16th. The United Nations force will not be related to the Suez Canal issue itself, which can only be considered separately after peace is fully established and all foreign troops have withdrawn. It is said that the main task of this international force is to ensure that Israel remains behind the demarcation line stipulated in the old armistice agreement.

News carried in the newspapers does not indicate that the fighting in and around Port Said is fierce. We have received some news about this battle, which indicates that the casualties are mainly Egyptian civilians, and the casualties are very large, reaching several thousand. The difficult situation in Port Said is very serious. We are taking urgent steps to send a large number of medicines to Egypt by special plane for relief.

The statement said that the past three and a half months since the nationalization of the Suez Canal Company have been filled with tragedy, and what has happened seems to me simply impossible in the present era. I find it somewhat difficult to deal with this record of blatant aggression and deception. The explanations offered from time to time are often contradictory, and the attitude towards things displayed by these explanations is dangerous to the freedom of Asian and African countries and to world peace itself. It has brought pain and disaster, hatred and hostility, and no benefit whatsoever. In addition, we are now under the threat of a possible world war.

Throughout the disputes since the nationalization of the Suez Canal Company, Egypt has always adopted a fairly proper and patient attitude. Without any legitimate reason, Egypt was not only attacked by Israel, but also by the United Kingdom and France. I do not know whether any consultations were conducted in advance between the aggressor countries. However, it is obvious that their plans were coordinated. The British and French offensive helped Israel's aggression, and it itself was helped by Israel's aggression. Egypt was immediately attacked by the armed forces of the United Kingdom and France after being invaded by Israel. Only after it aroused widespread popular anger not only in Asia and Africa but also in Europe and the Americas, and after the United Nations took action, was this aggression stopped to some extent. But, in my opinion, there is now a trend of complacency and laissez-faire after the implementation of the ceasefire. In fact, some attempts have even been made to downplay and justify this completely unwarranted and brutal attack on Egypt. To some extent, attention has been diverted to the serious and unfortunate events that have occurred in Hungary.

The statement said that although both events deserve serious attention, their nature is different.

The statement said that from the beginning, we have made it clear that we believe that the Hungarian people should be allowed to decide their own future according to their wishes, and that foreign troops should withdraw. This view has been and remains our fundamental view on the Hungarian issue.

The United Nations General Assembly passed a proposal on the Hungarian issue submitted by Pakistan, Cuba, Italy, Peru, and Ireland. We voted against this proposal. Because people have raised some criticisms about our voting against this proposal, I hope to clear up any misunderstandings that may arise. We believe that the wording of this proposal is inappropriate. However, the most unsatisfactory part of this proposal is that it requires elections to be held in Hungary under the supervision of the United Nations. We firmly oppose this because we believe that this violates the Charter and would degrade Hungary to the point of not being a sovereign state. We believe that agreeing to this form of interference and elections held under foreign supervision would create a bad precedent that could be used in the future to interfere in other countries. This proposal was voted on section by section. We abstained from voting on all other parts of this proposal. We voted against the section on holding elections under the supervision of the United Nations. When the entire proposal, including this section, was put to a vote, we also voted against it because of the section we strongly opposed.

This voting attitude towards this proposal is completely consistent with our country's general policy and instructions. In our opinion, this proposal, apart from one part that we fundamentally oppose, is of no help whatsoever to the Hungarian issue.

The statement also said that we are making arrangements to transport relief supplies to Hungary as soon as possible.

The statement concluded by saying that the world is now facing great danger. Perhaps the small-scale wars we have seen are only the first round, and larger wars are ahead. In particular, the ambitions of strong countries threaten weaker countries. The only hope lies in the United Nations, representing the world family, being able to end power politics and replace it with a more civilized way of handling problems. Today's choice is between the hydrogen bomb and Panchsheel.

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, November 17th: According to the Indian Press Trust, Indian Prime Minister Nehru told the Congress Parliamentary Party on November 15th that the crisis in West Asia has not passed. The situation largely depends on the outcome of the talks between the Egyptian authorities and UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld in Cairo in a day or two on the specific responsibilities of the UN international force.

Nehru told the members of the Congress Parliamentary Party that even if the current situation in West Asia does not worsen and shows improvement, it will take almost three months to reopen the Suez Canal. The closure of the Suez Canal has a serious impact on India, and some issues related to the implementation of India's Second Five-Year Plan may have to be reconsidered.

He reiterated the view that Bulganin's warning letters to the British Prime Minister and the French Prime Minister seemed to be directly related to the subsequent ceasefire.

When talking about the Hungarian issue, Nehru said that the Soviet Union believes that it was justified for the Soviet army to re-enter Budapest after its initial withdrawal on October 30th. The reason the Soviet Union held was partly that armed foreigners had crossed the border into Hungary and, together with others, began a massacre.

He said that India supports the demand that Soviet troops should withdraw from Hungary and that the Hungarian people should be given complete freedom to choose their own government. However, India opposes the suggestion that elections in that country should be held under the auspices of the United Nations. This would be a dangerous precedent, especially from the viewpoint of small countries.

Nehru, speaking to Indonesian journalists on the evening of November 14th about the relationship between the Hungarian events and Western countries, pointed out that Western countries had sent thousands of propaganda balloons to Hungary and dropped millions of propaganda pamphlets there. When the Hungarian riots reached their climax, the borders of Hungary were wide open, and many former Hungarian exiles re-entered Hungary. Nehru also mentioned the radio broadcasts that Western countries broadcast specifically to Hungary.

### 尼赫鲁揭露英法以蓄意违反联合国决议  强调外国军队必须全部撤出埃及  指出由联合国干涉匈牙利选举是侵犯国家主权

    尼赫鲁揭露英法以蓄意违反联合国决议
    强调外国军队必须全部撤出埃及
    指出由联合国干涉匈牙利选举是侵犯国家主权
    新华社新德里17日电　印度总理尼赫鲁16日在印度国会人民院发表了关于埃及和匈牙利局势的声明。
    尼赫鲁在声明中强调英法和以色列军队应该全部撤出埃及领土，并且指出，埃及事件和匈牙利事件性质是互不相同的。
    声明说，在苏伊士运河公司收归国有以后，印度曾经怀着极为忧虑的心情注意联合王国政府和法国政府的政策。特别是，为了在埃及采取军事行动而集结军队和飞机的做法，在我们看来，似乎是要恢复过去的殖民方法和通过显示武装力量来压制埃及。的确，联合王国和法国负责的政治家们曾经说过，埃及的政权必须更换，特别是埃及国家和政府首脑应当下台。但是我们曾经希望，在安全理事会通过（关于苏伊士运河问题的）决议以后，会采取比较和平的方法来解决这个纠纷。因此，联合王国和法国开始对埃及采取军事行动，特别是轰炸开罗城的一些地方和埃及其他一些地方的行为不仅使印度人民深为震惊，同时也使其他国家，包括联合王国的许多人深为震惊。这似乎是两个强国对一个比较弱的国家发动侵略的彰明昭著的事例，这种侵略的目的在于强迫执行它们的意旨、甚至是它们要更换这个国家的政府的意旨，这引起了全世界对英法行动的普遍反应，由于联合王国和法国行使否决权而使得安理会失去了效力，联合国大会在一次紧急会议上表示了它不同意这种行动，并且要求停止在埃及的军事行动，同时把以色列、法国和联合王国武装部队从埃及领土撤走。接着实现了一种不稳定的停战，联合王国、法国和以色列曾经宣布，它们将撤出它们的武装部队，虽然它们表明，这样做要有某些条件。
    这些事态发展给了人们某种希望，他们希望今后可以使用和平方法了。几天以前，我曾冒昧地说过，局势有一点好转了。今天我可一点也不敢肯定这种好转是否已经发生。有许多趋势，除非被制止住，否则就有可能使局势急剧恶化和恢复战争。假如不幸又开始军事行动的话，那末，扩展的地区就可能比现在要大得多，甚至有可能发展成为一场大战。
    声明说，尽管联合国大会作出了决议，零星的战斗还在继续发生，同时也没有要把军队撤出埃及的领土的意图。的确，这些军队好像已经在埃及领土上站稳了脚，而目前不打算离开了。如果这些外国军队继续留在埃及领土上的话，局势就可能要急剧地恶化，而且使得新的军事行动的危险更为接近。
    联合王国政府和法国虽然表面上接受了联合国的决议，可是他们却提出了不符合那个决议的某些条件。以色列总理仍然坚持他决不撤出加沙。如果外国军队不是全部撤离埃及领土的话，这就等于是公然违反联合国的决议。
    声明宣布，印度已经同意派遣自己的一支武装部队参加联合国国际部队，这支部队订于11月16日乘飞机离开印度。联合国部队将同苏伊士运河问题本身无关，这一问题只能在和平完全建立和一切外国军队撤退以后才能分别予以考虑。据说这支国际部队的主要任务就是要保证以色列留在旧停战协定所规定的分界线的后面。
    报纸刊载的消息并没有表明塞得港市内和附近的战斗是激烈的。我们接到一些关于这一战斗的消息，这些消息表示，遭受伤亡的主要是埃及老百姓，而且伤亡很大，达好几千人之多，塞得港市内的困难情况非常严重。我们正在采取紧急步骤，派专机把大批医药品运往埃及，以便救济。
    声明说，自从苏伊士运河公司收归国有以来的过去三个半月的情况充满了悲剧，而已经发生的事情在我看来简直是不可能在现时代发生的。对于这种厚颜无耻的侵略和欺骗的纪录，我觉得有些难于处理。不时提出的解释常常矛盾百出，而且这些解释所显示的对事情的态度对亚非各国的自由、以及对世界和平本身都是有危险的。它带来了痛苦和灾难，仇恨和敌意，而没有一点好处，除此以外，我们现在还处于可能发生世界大战的威胁之下。
    在苏伊士运河公司国有化之后的一切争执中间，埃及一直是采取相当妥善和忍耐的态度。毫无正当理由地，埃及不仅受到了以色列的攻击，而且还受到了联合王国和法国的攻击。侵略国家之间事先是否进行过任何磋商，这一点我不知道。但是，显而易见，他们的计划是互相配合的，英法的进攻帮助了以色列的侵略，而它自己也得到了以色列的侵略的帮助。埃及在遭到以色列的侵略以后马上又受到了联合王国和法国的武装力量的攻击。只有在不仅是在亚洲和非洲而且还在欧洲和美洲激起了人民广泛的愤怒，和在联合国采取了行动之后才在一定程度上制止了这种侵略。但是，据我看来，在实行停火以后现在存在着一种自满和听其自流的趋势。实际上，甚至已经有人进行过某种尝试，缩小并且证明对埃及的这种完全无端的、残忍的进攻是正当的。在某种程度上，注意力已经被转移到匈牙利发生的严重和不幸的事件上去了。
    声明说，虽然这两件事情都值得认真地注意，但是它们的性质是互不相同的。
    声明说，从一开始我们就表明，我们认为应当让匈牙利人民按照他们的愿望来决定他们自己的前途，外国军队应当撤退。这种看法在过去是而且现在仍然是我们对匈牙利问题的基本看法。
    联合国大会通过了一项由巴基斯坦、古巴、意大利、秘鲁和爱尔兰提出的关于匈牙利问题的提案，我们曾投票反对这项提案，由于人们对于我们投票反对这项提案提出一些批评，所以我希望来消除可能产生的任何误解。我们认为，这项提案的措辞是不适当的。但是，这个提案的最令人不满的一部分是：它要求在联合国监督下在匈牙利举行选举。我们坚决反对这一点，因为我们认为这违反宪章，而且会把匈牙利贬低得不成其为一个主权国家。我们认为，同意这种形式的干涉和外国监督下举行的选举，就会造成一个将来可能被人利用在其他国家进行干涉的不良先例。这个提案是一段一段地表决的。对于这个提案的所有其他部分，我们都放弃了投票。对于有关在联合国监督下举行选举这一段，我们投了反对票。在把包括这一段在内的整个提案提付表决的时候，我们由于我们所坚决反对的那一段的关系也投了反对票。
    对这一提案的这种投票态度是同我国的总政策和指示完全相符合的。在我们看来，这一提案除了其中一部分我们根本反对以外，对于匈牙利问题也是完全没有什么帮助的。
    声明又说，我们正在进行安排，以便尽早将救济物品运往匈牙利。
    声明最后说，世界现在面临着巨大的危险，也许我们所看见的这些小规模战争只是第一个回合，更大的战争还在前面。特别是，强国的野心威胁着较弱的国家。唯一的希望在于代表世界大家庭的联合国能够结束强权和用一种比较文明的处理问题的办法来代替它。今天的选择就在氢弹和潘查希拉之间。
    新华社新德里17日电　据印度报业托辣斯报道，印度总理尼赫鲁11月15日向国大党议会党团说，西亚局势的危急局面还没有过去。局势在很大程度上取决于埃及当局同联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德一两天内在开罗就联合国国际部队的具体职责举行会谈的结果。
    尼赫鲁向国大党议会党团的议员说，即使西亚目前的局势不再恶化而表现出有改善，也要差不多三个月才能使苏伊士运河重新开放。苏伊士运河的封闭对印度有严重的影响，有关执行印度第二个五年计划的某些问题可能必须重新加以考虑。
    他重申了这样的意见：布尔加宁给英国首相和法国总理的警告的信，看来同后来的停火有直接关系。
    尼赫鲁在谈到匈牙利问题时说，苏联认为，苏联军队在10月30日最初撤退后重新进入布达佩斯是正当的，苏联所持的理由一部分是，武装的外国人已经越境进入匈牙利，而且同其他的人一起开始了大屠杀。
    他说，印度支持关于苏联军队应当撤出匈牙利和匈牙利人民应当得到选择他们自己的政府的完全自由的要求。但是，印度反对那个国家的选举应当在联合国主持下举行的建议。这样将是危险的先例，特别是从小国的观点来看。
    尼赫鲁在11月14日晚上对印度尼西亚记者们谈到匈牙利事件同西方国家的关系时曾经指出，西方国家曾经向匈牙利放送了数以千计的宣传气球，并且在那里投了成百万本的宣传小册子。当匈牙利暴乱达到最高潮的时候，匈牙利的边境曾经门户洞开，有很多前匈牙利逃亡者重新进入匈牙利。尼赫鲁同时也提到了西方国家专向匈牙利播送的无线电广播。
