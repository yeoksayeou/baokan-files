The Basic Spirit of the "Eighth National Congress" Policies
Yang Er

Our entire nation is working diligently to build our country into a great socialist industrial power. In this great struggle, the policies of the Chinese Communist Party are of utmost importance. By adopting correct policies, we can achieve the greatest victory at the fastest speed. Conversely, it will delay our victory or reduce the scale of victory.

The most important significance of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China lies in its formulation of correct policies for socialist construction in our country. The specific contents of these policies have been detailed in the resolutions on the political report and other documents adopted by the "Eighth National Congress." Here, I will only discuss the basic spirit of formulating these policies.

What is this basic spirit? Comrade Liu Shaoqi said in his political report on behalf of the Central Committee of the CPC, "The current task of our party is to rely on the hundreds of millions of working people who have already been liberated and organized, to unite all forces that can be united at home and abroad, to make full use of all conditions favorable to us, and to build our country into a great socialist country as quickly as possible." The resolution of the congress on the political report also pointed out that the main task of the Party and the people of the whole country at present is to concentrate our efforts to transform our country from a backward agricultural country into an advanced industrial country as soon as possible. "This task is very arduous, and we must adopt correct policies in the economic, political, and cultural fields, unite all forces that can be united at home and abroad, and use all favorable conditions to accomplish this great task." That is to say: First, our primary task at present is socialist construction; second, in order to complete this construction task, the strength we rely on is the masses of the people, and all forces that can be united at home and abroad.

In order to achieve the goal of uniting the people for construction, we must have correct policies suitable for this purpose. All correct policies should not only be based on the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism, but also must proceed from the current actual situation. What is the most important characteristic of our current situation? This is that the main domestic contradiction has changed. As the socialist transformation has achieved a decisive victory, the main contradiction within our country, that is, the contradiction between the bourgeoisie and the working class, has been basically resolved. "The history of the class exploitation system for thousands of years has basically come to an end, and the socialist social system has been basically established in our country." The main contradiction in our country has been transformed into the contradiction between the people's demand for establishing an advanced industrial country and the reality of a backward agricultural country. Under the social conditions where the class contradiction has been basically resolved, it is possible for us to fully develop the enthusiasm of the broad masses of the people to build our country. Relying on the masses and their enthusiasm, the socialist cause can move forward smoothly; but without relying on the masses and their enthusiasm, the socialist cause will be harmed, and even suffer setbacks.

When considering the principles for formulating policies, we must oppose dogmatism and subjective one-sidedness. Dogmatism often makes us bind ourselves with some outdated and stale concepts, or regard the experience that was once applicable to a certain time and place as an immutable dogma and rigidly apply it to the current work, resulting in errors. Those with strong subjective one-sidedness often unilaterally exaggerate a certain aspect of certain correct guidelines, and even absolutize it. As a result, correct things become wrong things. Therefore, without opposing dogmatism and subjective one-sidedness, it is impossible to unite the masses for construction.

Here, we will list some examples to illustrate that the policies of the "Eighth National Congress" are imbued with the basic spirit of relying on the people and uniting the people to carry out socialist construction. This spirit is the concrete application of Marxism-Leninism and is incompatible with dogmatism and subjective one-sidedness.

First, let's talk about examples in economic policy.

In order to realize socialist industrialization, the "Eighth National Congress" first affirmed the policy of prioritizing the development of heavy industry. "There must be no neglect of the basic construction policy of giving priority to the development of heavy industry. The tendency to demand that all construction undertakings advance at the same pace, regardless of priorities, is wrong." Because giving priority to the development of heavy industry is in the most fundamental and long-term interests of the people of the whole country, the people of the whole country unanimously support working hard and practicing economy to build heavy industry. However, if we unilaterally emphasize the significance of giving priority to the development of heavy industry, and ignore the development of light industry, and ignore the development of agriculture and transportation, it may not be correct. Because unilaterally emphasizing the development of heavy industry and unilaterally emphasizing investment and development speed in heavy industry will inevitably affect the improvement of people's lives. Examples of unilaterally emphasizing the development of heavy industry regardless of specific conditions, to the extent that people's lives not only fail to rise with the development of production, but even decline, have not occurred.

On the issue of national construction and the improvement of people's lives, that is, on the issue of the relationship between collective interests, long-term interests, and individual interests, current interests, the policy adopted by the "Eighth National Congress" is "it is necessary to appropriately combine national construction and the improvement of people's lives, that is, to correctly handle the proportional relationship between accumulation and consumption in the national income." The resolution of the congress on the political report on the issue of increasing accumulation stated: "In order to realize socialist industrialization, the people of the whole country must subordinate current interests and individual interests to long-term interests and collective interests, work hard, be diligent and thrifty, and increase the country's capital accumulation on the basis of developing production and increasing labor productivity; at the same time, the government must practice strict economy and conscientiously reduce defense expenditures and administrative expenses. However, if the proportion of accumulation in the national income is set too high, without paying attention to appropriately improving people's lives on the basis of improving labor productivity, without paying attention to the current interests and individual interests of the masses of the people, it will damage the enthusiasm of the masses of the people to build socialism and damage the interests of socialism. Our tax policy, price policy, wage policy, and profit distribution policy of cooperative organizations should be able to guarantee the capital accumulation required for socialist construction and ensure the gradual improvement of people's lives."

Adhering to the principle of correctly combining collective and long-term interests with individual and current interests, and opposing one-sidedness on this issue, is the best way to ensure that the broad masses of the people recognize the superiority of the socialist system from their own experience. If we absolutize the importance of giving priority to the development of heavy industry, and make the improvement of people's lives too low and too slow in cases where it is not necessary, then we will become detached from the masses. Of course, we should never adopt the short-sighted policy of unilaterally emphasizing individual current interests. That policy will also lead us to become detached from the masses.

This correct principle, as stated in the original text of the resolution quoted above, must not only be adhered to in industrial construction, but also in agricultural construction. Unilaterally emphasizing accumulation in the distribution of income in agricultural cooperatives, and not paying attention to ensuring that farmers who join the cooperatives can increase their income, or even reduce their income, cannot inspire the enthusiasm of farmers for socialism.

Secondly, let's talk about examples in the policies for developing culture, education, and scientific undertakings.

In order to guarantee the prosperity of science and art, the Party has adopted the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" in this regard. This policy has been explained in detail in Comrade Lu Dingyi's article. Here, I only want to mention one of the basic spirits of this policy, that is, the leadership of Marxism-Leninism is absolutely incompatible with sectarianism.

Scientific and cultural undertakings must be developed brilliantly under the guidance of Marxism-Leninism. There is no doubt about this. However, some people do not understand the relationship between Marxism-Leninism and past cultural achievements, and thus make a one-sided and mechanical explanation of the leading role of Marxism-Leninism. Some people who claim to be Marxists treat Marxist theory as dogma, using it to deny past scientific and cultural achievements, or to deny the active parts of the research results of all non-Marxist scientists. This sectarian attitude is very harmful to creating a new socialist culture.

Among the past cultural achievements, many parts should be revolutionized with the weapons of Marxism-Leninism, but in order to build a new socialist culture, it is also necessary to absorb all the beneficial parts of all the cultural achievements created by mankind. That is to say, Marxists have not only the task of revolutionary transformation of human cultural achievements, but also the task of inheriting their excellent achievements. Neither can be neglected. Lenin emphasized in "The Tasks of the Youth Leagues" that "only by accurately understanding the culture created by the entire development process of mankind, only by transforming this past culture, can the culture of the proletariat be built." He also said: "Proletarian culture does not fall from the sky, nor is it imagined by those who call themselves experts in proletarian culture. To think so is nonsense. Proletarian culture should be the inevitable result of the development of the sum of knowledge created by mankind under the oppression of capitalist society, landlord society, and bureaucratic society." He also said that we "must distinguish between the bad things in the old schools and the things that are beneficial to us, and we should be good at selecting from the old schools the things that are necessary for communism." The policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" that we are implementing can guarantee the achievement of the above-mentioned goals. Some people think that implementing the policy of "letting a hundred schools of thought contend" means that the leadership of Marxism-Leninism is no longer needed. Others think that the Party has adopted this policy only to induce all anti-Marxist ideas to come to the fore in order to criticize them. These ideas are incorrect. The policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" is a policy that can unite all patriotic scientific and artistic workers. This policy can mobilize all active forces in science and art to make the greatest contribution to the cause of building a new socialist culture under the leadership of the general policy of Marxism-Leninism.

Thirdly, let's talk about examples in the political system.

The resolution of the congress on the political report pointed out on the one hand: "In order to effectively undertake the great task of economic and cultural construction, it is necessary to continue to strengthen our country's people's democratic dictatorship." On the other hand, the resolution also pointed out: "After our country enters the period of socialist construction, it is of urgent and important significance to further expand the country's democratic life and carry out the struggle against bureaucracy."

Here, there is a question of the relationship between democracy and dictatorship. Regarding the issue of dictatorship, the resolution writes: "The people's democratic dictatorship after the nationwide victory of the bourgeois democratic revolution is essentially the dictatorship of the proletariat. Its task is to unite the broadest masses of the people to jointly build socialism and to fight against the enemies of socialism." Originally, the people's democratic dictatorship is the most democratic system for the broad masses of the people. Correctly expanding the democratic life within the people will not only not weaken the dictatorship over the enemy, but also help to strengthen and consolidate this dictatorship. However, under the conditions of sharp struggle against the enemy, this democracy within the people cannot but be limited to a certain extent in some aspects. Now, since the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries has achieved a decisive victory, since the contradiction between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in our country has been basically resolved, since the socialist social system has been basically established in our country, since our country's people's democratic dictatorship has been consolidated, expanding the country's democratic life is a very urgent matter.

If someone denies the necessity of expanding the country's democratic life at present based on the fact that there are still internal and external enemies, then they cannot fully develop the enthusiasm of the masses to build socialism, nor can they fully mobilize the people's strength to overcome the great danger of bureaucracy. However, if someone unilaterally emphasizes the importance of expanding democratic life, ignores that the main purpose of expanding democratic life is still to consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, ignores the existence of counter-revolutionary elements at present, and denies the necessity of continuing to strike against counter-revolutionary forces, it is also wrong.

In this regard, the "Eighth National Congress" adopted the policy of actively expanding democratic life. The resolution of the congress on the political report pointed out: "We must use the method of strengthening the Party's leadership and supervision over state organs, the method of strengthening the supervision of people's congresses at all levels over state organs at all levels, the method of strengthening the supervision of state organs at all levels from top to bottom and from bottom to top, and the method of strengthening the criticism and supervision of state organs by the masses of the people and lower-level staff in the organs, to carry out unremitting struggle against the phenomenon of bureaucracy that is divorced from the masses and divorced from reality." In addition, the resolution also pointed out: "We must further strengthen the socialist legal system of people's democracy and consolidate the order of socialist construction. The state must gradually and systematically formulate complete laws according to needs. All state organs and state personnel must strictly abide by state laws so that the people's democratic rights can be fully protected by the state." On this issue, Comrade Liu Shaoqi pointed out in the political report that in the past, in order to liberate the people from reactionary rule and liberate social productive forces from the shackles of old production relations, the main method of struggle was the direct action of the masses of the people. Therefore, we only formulated some temporary and programmatic laws suitable for the needs at that time. "Now, the period of revolutionary storms has passed, new production relations have been established, and the task of struggle has become to protect the smooth development of social productive forces. Therefore, the method of struggle must also be changed accordingly, and a complete legal system is absolutely necessary."

In expanding democracy within the people, one of the most important policies is to continue to consolidate the people's democratic united front based on the worker-peasant alliance, and to continue to strengthen the cooperation between the Communist Party and the democratic parties and non-party democrats in accordance with the policy of long-term coexistence and mutual supervision. Some people unilaterally believe that since the people's democratic dictatorship is essentially the dictatorship of the proletariat, it should not allow the existence of political parties representing other classes, let alone allow them to hold positions in the government. The nature of the mistake made by these people is that they have opposed the task of expanding democracy within the people to the task of consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship. They do not understand that consolidating the alliance between the working class and the national bourgeoisie is conducive to our transformation of this class and is conducive to striving for the transformation of a large number of intellectuals owned by this class to participate in socialist construction. In addition, the democratic parties and non-party democrats can play an important role in reflecting the opinions of people from all walks of life and in opposing bureaucracy. Expanding this democratic life within the people can unite the masses of the people more widely and can better consolidate our people's democratic dictatorship. The two seem to be opposites, but they are actually complementary.

In addition to the relationship between dictatorship and democracy, there is also the relationship between centralization and democracy, or unity and decentralization. This is a relationship within the people.

Comrade Liu Shaoqi said in the political report: "Our state system is a combination of a high degree of democracy and a high degree of centralization." Obviously, neither of these two aspects can be neglected. Experience in recent years has proved that it is absolutely necessary to oppose decentralism, otherwise we cannot make our country, which is so large and populous, operate like a complete machine in a unified and rhythmic manner. However, if we unilaterally and inappropriately emphasize unified centralization, it will also have consequences that are harmful to the enthusiasm of the masses. In the political report, Comrade Liu Shaoqi criticized the shortcomings of some departments of the central government in recent years for grasping too many affairs and restricting the local authorities too much and too rigidly. The phenomenon of the leading organs being busy with affairs and forming serious bureaucracy due to the unilateral emphasis on centralized unity will obviously damage the development of the people's enthusiasm.

Fourthly, let's talk about policies in international relations. Here, we will only talk about the issue of unity and cooperation within the socialist camp in international relations. The friendship and cooperation between socialist countries is the primary international condition for our country to carry out socialist construction. In order to strengthen this friendship and cooperation, it is necessary to further strengthen the internationalist unity of the proletariat and oppose great-power chauvinism.

The resolution of the congress on the political report, when pointing out our country's policy in international affairs, said: "(1) Continue to consolidate and strengthen the eternal and unbreakable fraternal friendship with the great Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries; ... (7) Support the socialist movement of the working class and working people of all countries, and strengthen the internationalist unity of the proletariat of all countries; (8) In all contacts with all foreign countries and foreign peoples, educate our own staff to adopt a truly equal attitude and strictly oppose great-power chauvinism." These policies are precisely in order to best strengthen the internationalist unity of the proletariat and strengthen the unity of the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union.

In strengthening the internationalist unity among socialist countries, the declaration issued by the Soviet government on October 30, 1956 on the basis of developing and further strengthening the friendship and cooperation between the Soviet Union and other socialist countries is of great significance. Our government has expressed its approval and active support for this declaration by the Soviet government. The statement of our government said: "In socialist countries, due to the consistency of ideological basis and goals of struggle, some staff members often easily neglect the principle of equality among countries in mutual relations. This error, in its nature, is the error of bourgeois chauvinism. This error, especially the error of great-power chauvinism, will inevitably bring serious harm to the unity and common cause of socialist countries. Therefore, the leading personnel, staff members, and people of the whole country of our government must be constantly vigilant to prevent the error of great-power chauvinism in relations with socialist countries and other countries."

Even though we recognize the principle of internationalism and the principle of equality among countries, this does not mean that we will not make the mistake of great-power chauvinism. The mood of pride and complacency, of great-power chauvinism, is something we must always be vigilant about. Also, some people, in the process of opposing great-power chauvinism of others, may themselves neglect the principle of internationalism and fall into the error of bourgeois nationalism, which must also be guarded against and prevented. Great-power chauvinism can never be overcome by nationalism. To overcome and correct great-power chauvinism, it is necessary to adhere to internationalism.

Only by adhering to the principle of internationalism, as Comrade Mao Zedong recently called, "Chinese people, in international exchanges, should resolutely, thoroughly, cleanly, and completely eliminate great-power chauvinism." ("In Memory of Dr. Sun Yat-sen") We will be able to obtain the most powerful support for our country's socialist construction from the people of all countries in the powerful and united socialist camp, and from all international friends who are willing to have equal exchanges with us.

Finally, let's talk about the issue of the Party's leadership.

To mobilize and unite the people to build socialism, and to make the Communist Party the core force for uniting the people, it is necessary to ensure the correctness of the Party's leadership. This requires improving the Party's level of Marxism-Leninism and opposing subjectivism.

Our Party has rich experience in fighting against subjectivism. It is precisely because the Party Central Committee has overcome subjectivism in its leadership work that we have been able to achieve revolutionary victory. However, the reason why we are now particularly emphasizing the need to oppose subjectivism is because we are facing a completely new historical task, namely socialist construction, and we were completely unfamiliar with this work in the past. This situation, coupled with a burst of praise for victory, is bound to develop the error of subjectivism. This subjectivism, coupled with a mood of pride and complacency, can develop into extremely bad bureaucracy and sectarianism, and even take on some despotic colors in some respects. If we do not pay attention to overcoming it, it will cause us to become detached from the masses.

Our subjectivism in formulating current policies is often manifested as one-sidedness in dealing with various contradictory relationships. Many relationships that we have listed in the previous examples, such as the relationship between national construction and improving people's lives, the relationship between dictatorship and democracy, the relationship between centralization and democracy, the relationship between the leadership of Marxism-Leninism and the contention of a hundred schools of thought, etc., if they are not given a correct solution, but one-sidedly emphasizing one aspect of them, it will cause huge damage. The "Eighth National Congress" made correct solutions to these relationships. This solution is the correct application of materialist dialectics, and this solution is an example of opposing subjectivism.

Regarding the Party's organizational work, the "Eighth National Congress" emphasized the combination of discipline and creativity, the combination of collective leadership and individual responsibility, and the combination of the masses and the leaders. On the issue of dealing with Party members who make mistakes, the "Eighth National Congress" emphasized the need to separate the issue of right and wrong from the issue of the enemy and ourselves, pointing out that the methods of struggle against the enemy cannot be used to treat comrades who make mistakes due to subjective understanding. These are all in order to oppose one-sidedness, oppose subjectivism, and in order to mobilize the active factors within the Party, so as to unite the whole Party and unite the entire masses of the people.

In short, the masses of the people are the most important reliance for us to build socialism. If we underestimate the strength of the masses and think that we can build a socialist industrial country by setting aside the masses and unilaterally emphasizing the growth of technical strength, the growth of technical cadres, or relying on some other strength, it will inevitably cause damage to the work. The "Eighth National Congress," in the Party's style of work, once again emphasized the necessity of adhering to the mass line, and once again pointed out that the mass line is the Party's fundamental political line and organizational line, which is extremely important. The policies formulated by the "Eighth National Congress" are all aimed at uniting the masses of the people to the greatest extent and highly developing their enthusiasm. These policies are all based on the Party's mass line. In the past two revolutionary stages, we achieved victory by relying on the policy of boldly mobilizing the masses. Now that we are carrying out socialist construction, although the tasks are different, we cannot neglect the principle of Marxism-Leninism of taking the mass line in the slightest. We must never forget this basic experience and go down the wrong path of not relying on the masses.

    “八大”的政策的基本精神
    杨耳
    我们全国人民正在紧张地努力，以求把我国建设成为一个伟大的社会主义的工业国。在这个伟大的斗争中，中国共产党的政策具有极重大的意义。采取正确的政策，我们就能够以最快的速度，取得最大的胜利。反之，就会推迟我们的胜利，或者缩小胜利的规模。
    中国共产党第八次代表大会的最重要的意义，就在于它为在我国进行社会主义建设制定了各项正确的政策。这些政策的具体内容，在“八大”通过的关于政治报告的决议和其它各项文件中，已经有了详细的说明，我在这里只谈谈制定这些政策的基本精神。
    这个基本精神是什么呢？刘少奇同志在代表中共中央委员会所作的政治报告中说，“我们党现时的任务，就是要依靠已经获得解放和已经组织起来的几亿劳动人民，团结国内外一切可能团结的力量，充分利用一切对我们有利的条件，尽可能迅速地把我国建设成为一个伟大的社会主义国家。”大会关于政治报告的决议也指出，党和全国人民的当前的主要任务，就是要集中力量把我国尽快地从落后的农业国变为先进的工业国。“这个任务是很艰巨的，我们必须在经济、政治、文化等方面采取正确的政策，团结国内外一切可能团结的力量，利用一切有利的条件，来完成这个伟大的任务。”这就是说：第一，我们当前的主要任务是社会主义建设；第二，为了完成这个建设任务，我们所要依靠的力量，是人民群众，是国内外一切可能团结的力量。
    为了达到团结人民进行建设的目的，我们必须有适合于这个目的的正确政策。一切正确的政策，不仅应该建立在马克思列宁主义的基本原理的基础上，还必须从当前的实际情况出发。我国当前情况最重要的特点是什么呢？这就是国内的主要矛盾已经转变了。由于社会主义改造已经取得决定性的胜利，我国内部的主要矛盾，即资产阶级和工人阶级之间的矛盾，已经基本上解决了。“几千年来的阶级剥削制度的历史已经基本上结束，社会主义的社会制度在我国已经基本上建立起来了”。我们国内的主要矛盾，已经转变为人民对于建立先进工业国的要求同落后的农业国的现实之间的矛盾了。在阶级矛盾已经基本上解决的社会条件下，我们是有可能充分地发扬广大的人民群众的积极性，来建设我们的国家的。依靠群众，依靠他们的积极性，社会主义事业就能顺利地前进；但是，不依靠群众，不依靠他们的积极性，社会主义事业就会受到损害，甚至会遭到挫折。
    在考虑制定政策的原则的时候，我们必须反对教条主义和主观片面性。教条主义常常使我们用一些过时的、陈腐的观念把自己束缚起来，或者把曾经适用于一时一地的经验当做万古不变的教条，硬套在当前的工作中去，结果就造成错误。而主观片面性浓厚的人，常常把某些正确方针的某一个方面，片面地夸大起来，甚至把它加以绝对化，结果，正确的东西也就变成了错误的东西。因此，不反对教条主义和主观片面性，是不可能团结群众进行建设的。
    这里，我们要列举一些例证，来说明“八大”的政策，是贯串着依靠人民、团结人民来进行社会主义建设的基本精神的。这个精神是马克思列宁主义的具体运用，是和教条主义、主观片面性不相容的。
    首先，说说经济政策方面的例证。
    为了实现社会主义的工业化，“八大”首先肯定了优先发展重工业的方针。“对于优先发展重工业这一基本建设方针不能有任何的忽视。要求各项建设事业不分轻重缓急地齐头并进的倾向，是错误的”。由于优先发展重工业是全国人民最根本的利益和最长远的利益，因此，艰苦奋斗、节衣缩食来建设重工业，是全国人民所一致拥护的。但是，如果我们片面强调优先发展重工业的意义，而忽视轻工业的发展，忽视农业、运输业等的发展，就不见得正确了。因为片面强调发展重工业，片面强调对重工业的投资和发展速度，势必影响到人民生活的改善。由于不问具体条件而片面强调发展重工业，以至弄得人民生活不仅不能随着生产的发展而上升，甚至反而下降的例子，并不是没有发生过的。
    在国家建设和人民生活改善的问题上，也就是集体利益、长远利益同个人利益、当前利益的关系的问题上，“八大”所采取的方针是“必须使国家建设和人民生活改善这两个方面得到适当的结合，也就是使国民收入中积累和消费的比例关系得到正确的处理。”大会关于政治报告的决议关于增加积累的问题说道：“为了实现社会主义工业化，全国人民必须使当前利益和个人利益服从长远利益和集体利益，艰苦奋斗，克勤克俭，在发展生产和提高劳动生产率的基础上增加国家的资金积累；同时，政府必须厉行节约，认真节减国防费用和行政费用的支出。但是如果过高地规定国民收入中积累的比重，不注意在劳动生产率提高的基础上适当地改善人民的生活，不注意人民群众当前利益和个人利益，就会损害人民群众建设社会主义的积极性，损害社会主义的利益。我们的税收政策、物价政策、工资政策和合作社组织收益的分配政策，应当既能够保证社会主义建设所需要的资金积累，又能够保证人民生活的逐步改善。”
    坚持集体的、长远的利益同个人的、当前的利益的正确结合的原则，反对在这个问题上的片面性，是保证广大群众从切身经验中认识到社会主义制度优越性的最好的方法。如果我们把优先发展重工业的重要性绝对化起来，在并非必要的情况下，使人民生活的改善进行得过低过慢，那么，我们就会脱离群众。自然，我们也绝不应该采取那种片面强调个人目前利益的短视政策，那种政策同样会把我们引到脱离群众的道路上去。
    这个正确的原则，正如前面所引的决议原文所说的，不只是在工业建设方面必须坚持，在农业建设方面也是一样。在农业合作社的收益分配上片面强调积累，不注意保证加入合作社的农民能够增加收入，甚至反而降低了收入，这是不能鼓舞农民对社会主义的积极性的。
    其次，说说在发展文化教育和科学事业的政策方面的例证。
    党为了保证科学和艺术事业的繁荣，在这方面采取了“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针。这个方针在陆定一同志的文章中已经作了详尽的说明。这里只想说到这个方针的基本精神之一，即马克思列宁主义的领导，是同宗派主义绝不相容的。
    科学文化事业，必须在马克思列宁主义的指导之下，才能获得光辉的发展。这是毫无疑义的。但是，有些人不懂得马克思列宁主义和已往文化成果的关系，因而对马克思列宁主义的领导作用作出片面的、机械的解释。有一些自命为马克思主义者的人，他们把马克思主义的理论当做教条，用来否认已往的科学文化成果，或者用来否认一切非马克思主义的科学工作者研究成果中的积极部分。这种宗派主义的态度，对于创造社会主义的新文化，是十分有害的。
    已往的文化成果当中，有很多部分都应该用马克思列宁主义的武器加以革命的改造，但是，为了建设社会主义新文化，也必须把人类所创造的全部文化成果中一切有益的部分都接收过来。这就是说，马克思主义者对于人类文化成果，除了有革命改造的任务，还有继承其优秀成果的任务。两者不可偏废。列宁在“青年团的任务”中，曾经着重地说明：“只有确切通晓人类全部发展过程所造成的文化，只有改造这种已往的文化，才能建设无产阶级的文化”。他又说：“无产阶级文化并不是从空中掉下来的，也不是那些自命为无产阶级文化专家的人所臆想出来的。如果认为这样，那就是胡说八道了。无产阶级文化应当是人类在资本主义社会、地主社会、官僚社会压迫下所创造出来的知识总汇发展的必然结果。”他还说，我们“要把旧时学校中坏的东西与对我们有益的东西区别开来，应该善于从旧学校中挑选出共产主义所必需的东西。”我们所实行的“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的政策，是能够保证达到上述的目的的。有人以为，实行“百家争鸣”的政策，就是不要马克思列宁主义的领导了，也有人以为党采取这个政策只是为了诱导一切反马克思主义的思想露出头来，以便批判。这些想法，都是不正确的。“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的政策，是能够把一切爱国的科学艺术工作者团结起来的政策。这个政策能够动员科学艺术方面的一切积极力量，在马克思列宁主义的总方针的领导之下，对建设社会主义新文化的事业作出最大的贡献。
    再其次，谈谈在政治制度方面的例证。
    大会关于政治报告的决议一方面指出：“为了有效地担负起伟大的经济文化建设任务，必须继续加强我国的人民民主专政。”另一方面，决议又指出：“在我国进入社会主义建设时期以后，进一步地扩大国家的民主生活，开展反对官僚主义的斗争，有迫切的、重要的意义。”
    这里存在着一个民主和专政的关系问题。关于专政的问题，决议写道：“在资产阶级民主革命取得全国胜利以后的人民民主专政，实质上就是无产阶级专政。它的任务就是团结全国最广大的人民来共同建设社会主义，并且同社会主义的敌人作斗争。”本来，人民民主专政对于广大的人民群众是最民主的制度。正确地扩大人民内部的民主生活，不但不会削弱对敌人的专政，而且有助于加强和巩固这个专政。但是，在对敌人进行尖锐斗争的条件下，这种人民内部的民主也不能不在某些方面受到一定程度的限制。现在，由于镇压反革命的运动已经取得了决定性的胜利，由于我国的无产阶级同资产阶级之间的矛盾已经基本上解决，社会主义的社会制度在我国已经基本上建立起来了，由于我国人民民主专政已经巩固了，扩大国家的民主生活，就是十分迫切的事情了。
    如果有人根据还有内外敌人存在的事实，就片面地否认当前有扩大国家民主生活的必要性，那就不能充分发挥群众建设社会主义的积极性，也不能充分动员人民的力量来克服官僚主义的巨大危险。但是，如果有人片面强调扩大民主生活的重要性，忽视扩大民主生活的主要目的仍是为了巩固人民民主专政，忽视目前还有反革命分子的存在，否认对反革命力量继续加以打击的必要性，同样也是错误的。
    “八大”在这一方面，采取了积极扩大民主生活的方针，大会关于政治报告的决议指出：“必须用加强党对于国家机关的领导和监督的方法，用加强各级人民代表大会对于各级国家机关的监督的方法，用加强各级国家机关的由上而下和由下而上的监督的方法，用加强人民群众和机关中的下级工作人员对于国家机关的批评和监督的方法，来同脱离群众、脱离实际的官僚主义现象作坚持不懈的斗争。”此外，决议还指出：“我们必须进一步加强人民民主的法制，巩固社会主义建设的秩序。国家必须根据需要，逐步地系统地制定完备的法律。一切国家机关和国家工作人员必须严格遵守国家的法律，使人民的民主权利充分地受到国家的保护。”对于这个问题，刘少奇同志在政治报告中指出，在过去，为了从反动统治下解放人民，从旧的生产关系束缚下解放社会生产力，斗争的主要方法是人民群众的直接行动，因此，我们只制订了一些适合当时需要的、临时的纲领性的法律，“现在，革命的暴风雨时期已经过去了，新的生产关系已经建立起来，斗争的任务已经变为保护社会生产力的顺利发展，因此，斗争的方法也就必须跟着改变，完备的法制就是完全必要的了。”
    在扩大人民内部的民主方面，最重要的政策之一，就是继续巩固以工农联盟为基础的人民民主统一战线，并且按照长期共存、互相监督的方针，继续加强共产党同各民主党派和无党派民主人士的合作。有的人片面地认为人民民主专政既然在实质上是无产阶级专政，就不应该容许有代表其它阶级群众的政党存在，更不应该容许它们担任政权中的工作。这些人所犯的错误的性质，就是由于他们把扩大人民内部的民主和巩固人民民主专政的任务对立起来了。他们不懂得巩固工人阶级同民族资产阶级的联盟，是有利于我们对这个阶级的改造，并有利于争取改造这个阶级所拥有的大批知识分子来参加社会主义建设的。此外，各民主党派和无党派民主人士，在反映各阶层人士的意见方面，在反对官僚主义方面，都能起重要的作用。扩大人民内部的这种民主生活，就能更广泛地团结人民群众，就能够更好地巩固我们的人民民主专政。这两者似是相反，而实是相成的。
    除了专政和民主的关系以外，这里还有一个集中和民主、或统一和分散的关系问题。这是存在于人民内部的一个关系问题。
    刘少奇同志在政治报告里说：“我们的国家制度是高度的民主和高度的集中的结合。”显然，这两方面也是不能偏废的。几年来的经验证明，反对分散主义是完全必要的，否则就不能使我们这样一个地大人多的国家像一部完整的机器那样步调一致地、有节奏地运行，但是如果片面地不适当地强调统一集中，也会产生有害于群众的积极性的后果。刘少奇同志在政治报告里，批评了近几年来中央有些部门抓了过多的事务，对地方限制得过多过死的缺点。那种由于片面强调集中统一而造成领导机关忙于事务、并且形成严重官僚主义的现象，显然是会损害于人民积极性的发扬的。
    再其次，谈到国际关系方面的政策。这里，只谈国际关系中社会主义阵营的团结合作方面的问题。社会主义阵营各国间的友谊和合作，是我国进行社会主义建设的首要的国际条件。为了加强这种友谊和合作，必须进一步加强无产阶级的国际主义的团结，反对大国主义。
    大会关于政治报告的决议，在指出我国在国际事务中的方针的时候说：“（一）继续巩固和加强同伟大的苏联和各人民民主国家的永恒的、牢不可破的兄弟友谊；……（七）支持各国工人阶级和劳动人民的社会主义运动，加强各国无产阶级的国际主义团结；（八）在同一切外国和外国人民的交往中，教育自己的工作人员采取真正平等对待的态度，严格反对大国主义。”这些方针，正是为了最好地加强无产阶级的国际主义团结，加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国的团结。
    在加强社会主义各国之间的国际主义团结方面，苏联政府在1956年10月30日发表的关于发展和进一步加强苏联同其它社会主义国家的友谊和合作的基础的宣言，是具有重大意义的。我国政府对于苏联政府的这个宣言，表示了赞同和积极的支持。我国政府的声明说：“在社会主义各国，由于思想基础和奋斗目标的一致，某些工作人员常常容易在相互关系中忽略各国平等的原则。这种错误，就其性质来说，是资产阶级沙文主义的错误。这种错误，特别是大国的沙文主义错误，对于社会主义各国的团结和共同事业，必然会带来严重的损害。因此，我国政府的领导人员、工作人员和全国人民，必须时刻警惕，防止在同社会主义国家和其他国家的关系中犯大国沙文主义的错误。”
    尽管我们承认国际主义的原则、承认各国平等的原则，但是，这决不是说，我们不会犯大国沙文主义的错误了。骄傲自满的大国主义情绪，是我们务须经常警惕的。还有，有些人在反对旁人的大国主义的过程中，自己也会忽略国际主义的原则，而陷入资产阶级民族主义的错误中去，这也是必须警惕和防止的。大国主义决不可能被民族主义所克服。要克服和纠正大国主义，就必须坚持国际主义。
    只有坚持国际主义的原则，像毛泽东同志最近所号召的那样，“中国人在国际交往方面，应当坚决、彻底、干净、全部地消灭大国主义”。（“纪念孙中山先生”）我们才有可能从强大和团结的社会主义阵营里的各国人民那里，从一切愿意同我们平等交往的国际友人那里，取得对我国社会主义建设的最有力的支援。
    最后，谈到关于党的领导方面的问题。
    要动员、团结人民来建设社会主义，要使共产党成为团结人民的核心力量，就必须保证党的领导的正确。这就必须提高党的马克思列宁主义的水平，反对主观主义。
    我们党有同主观主义作斗争的丰富的经验。正是由于党中央在自己的领导工作中克服了主观主义，我们才能够取得革命的胜利。但是，我们现在所以特别着重提出要反对主观主义，是因为我们正面对着完全新的历史任务，即社会主义建设，而这个工作，我们在过去是完全不熟悉的。这种情况，再加上对胜利的一片赞扬，主观主义的错误必然会发展起来。这种主观主义，加上骄傲自满的情绪，可以发展为极恶劣的官僚主义和宗派主义，甚至在有些方面带上某些专制主义的色彩。我们如果不注意把它克服，就会使我们脱离群众。
    我们在制定当前政策问题上的主观主义，常常表现为在对待各种矛盾关系上的片面性。我们在前面例证中所列举的许多关系，如国家建设和改善人民生活的关系，专政和民主、集中和民主的关系，马克思列宁主义的领导和百家争鸣的关系等等，如果不给以正确的解决，而是片面地强调其中的某一方面，就会造成巨大的损害。“八大”对这些关系作出了正确的解决，这种解决是唯物辩证法的正确运用，这种解决就是反对主观主义的范例。
    关于党的组织工作，“八大”强调了纪律性和创造性的结合，集体领导和个人负责的结合，群众和领袖的结合。在对待党员犯错误的问题上，“八大”强调了要把是非问题和敌我问题分开，指出不能用对待敌人的斗争方法来对待由于认识上的主观主义而犯错误的同志。这些，都是为了反对片面性，反对主观主义，都是为了调动党内的积极因素，以便团结全党，团结全体人民群众。
    总之，人民群众，是我们建设社会主义最重要的依靠。如果轻视群众的力量，以为可以撇开群众而片面强调依靠技术力量的增长、技术干部的增长，或依靠其它什么力量就可以建设社会主义工业国，就必然会使工作遭到损害。“八大”在党的作风上，再一次强调坚持群众路线的必要性，再一次指出群众路线是党的根本政治路线和组织路线，这是极为重要的。“八大”所制定的各项政策，都是为了最大限度地团结人民群众，高度发扬他们的积极性。这些政策都是建立在党的群众路线的基础之上的。我们在过去两个革命阶段中，都是依靠放手发动群众的政策而取得胜利的。现在我们在进行社会主义建设，任务尽管不同，但是，对于走群众路线这一条马克思列宁主义的原则，却不可有丝毫的忽视。我们切不可忘记掉这个基本经验，而走到不依靠群众的错误道路上去。
