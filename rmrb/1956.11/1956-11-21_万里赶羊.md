    Ten Thousand Li Sheep Drive
    By our special correspondent Xiao Qian

    "At the end of October, the ewes on the Xilin Gol grassland in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region comprehensively began regular mating. It is estimated that more than one million lambs will be bred around the Qingming Festival next year. These days, a group of trained artificial insemination technicians have arrived in various banners to prepare for mating.
    "The wool yield of sheep on the Xilin Gol grassland is low, and the wool quality is rough. Therefore, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region transported more than a thousand Xinjiang fine-wool rams this year to mate with Mongolian sheep. Hybrid fine-wool lambs will appear here next spring." The "People's Daily" published such a message on November 5th. Imagine, how far apart are Xinjiang and Inner Mongolia, these two autonomous regions? And how inconvenient is the transportation? However, Xinjiang's fine-wool rams were "transported" to the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.
    How were they "transported"?
    In the past, sheep were transported from western Xinjiang either by plane or by truck from Yili. This batch of sheep was not transported that way. They were first "herded" (people driving the sheep on foot) to Urumqi, and then transported by trucks and trains. The comrades who transported the sheep started from the Gongnais sheep farm in Gongliu County, western Xinjiang. They first walked with the 1,400 sheep, climbed twelve snow-capped mountains as high as 4,000 meters, crossed more than a hundred river mouths ravaged by mountain floods, stepped through reed marshes and swamps, crossed primitive forests where human footprints have never reached, passed through snake-infested areas and poisonous grass beaches, fought against wolves and bear groups, and after seventy-five days, arrived in Urumqi. Then, they overcame numerous unimaginable difficulties in the process of transportation by trucks and trains. They traveled through five provinces and two autonomous regions, experiencing a journey of 11,500 li, and "transported" these fine-wool rams to the Inner Mongolia grassland.
    Why do this?
    Doing so saved the country nearly 50,000 yuan compared to transporting by plane; doing so made the sheep's physique exercised, and increased an average of five kilograms of fat per sheep.
    I visited the cadres sent by the Animal Husbandry Department of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region to Xinjiang to buy sheep in Hohhot, especially the leader Comrade Hadi. Their conversations are truly inspiring poems. From their experience in doing this, we can understand what kind of cadres who are loyal to their duties and how much they love the people of our country are there!
    "Walk through the Tianshan Mountains!" This is a bold decision, a heroic decision. Before making up their minds, the six cadres and twenty-seven temporary workers couldn't help but hesitate for a while. Good heavens, no one has ever herded so many sheep through this 1,400-li snow mountain that never melts all year round! What if people get sick? What if the sheep sprain their legs? Many doubts entangled them.
    The balance always has two ends. One end is the incalculable difficulties (some difficulties are real, some are disguised); the other end is the benefits of "herding" to the country and to the sheep. This balance swayed up and down in everyone's heart. Daxiafu, the director of the Animal Husbandry Department of Xinjiang, said: "Let's do it! The sheep are sturdy sheep, and among you are experienced shepherds, and the farm will find you a good guide." The Kazakh comrades from the sheep farm immediately started drawing route maps for them.
    Okay, let's walk through the Tianshan Mountains.
    So, they first divided the 1,050 ewes and 350 rams into three herding groups. Each group had a veterinary cadre, four workers, and was responsible for about 500 sheep. Rams like to butt each other, and if they get injured, they will soon breed maggots. Generally, people would rather manage three ewes than one ram. However, veterinarian Xin Zhongzhi took the initiative to be responsible for this group. In addition to this, there was also a cooking team. There were four ethnic groups in the team: Mongolian, Han, Hui, and Kazakh. Everyone agreed to follow the Hui comrades for food all the way, and the cooking was entirely managed by them. The cooking team not only cooked, but also collected firewood and pulled sick sheep. There was also a transportation team. Luggage, tents, and food had to be transported. They initially wanted to hire some Xinjiang locals to drive livestock to carry them, but it would cost 5,000 yuan, plus their return expenses. No, it's better to spend 3,000 yuan to buy twenty-four horses. It is estimated that they can be sold at the original price when they arrive in Urumqi, wouldn't that save the country another sum of money?
    In order to ensure that sick people would not be left behind and that sick sheep would not be lost, they also bought two four-wheeled carriages. Driving a horse-drawn carriage on the Tianshan Mountains is an unheard-of wonder. Many local villagers stopped them, saying that the mountain road was so narrow that even two sheep could not walk side by side, how could they bring a carriage! But they decided to bring it anyway. Of course, they did not expect at all the difficulties these two big carriages would cause them.
    On June 14th, they set off with the old worker of the sheep farm, Wumu'er, in a mighty manner.
    The first hurdle was poisonous snakes. From June 14th to 27th, they walked entirely through poisonous snake areas. Oh my, it was truly a world of snakes. In the waist-high grass, there were long, several-foot-long patterned snakes everywhere, crawling crookedly, sometimes even raising their long necks and spitting out their cores at people menacingly. A shepherd got hot, took off his coat and put it down for a while, and when he went to pick it up later, several snakes had already crawled in, making it heavy. One night, a horse was bitten, and in no time it turned yellow all over, and after a while it fell down and died.
    When passing through the poisonous snake area, they had only one thought in their minds: no matter what, they couldn't let the sheep get bitten by snakes. They walked in front of the flock, holding whips in their hands, and whipping them loudly all the way, making sharp echoes in the mountains.
    It was easy during the day, but it was difficult to camp at night. They always carefully investigated the terrain to see if there were many snake dens. On the 20th, they chose a very beautiful place called Yishibulake ("Three Springs"), thinking that they would not be threatened by poisonous snakes. Who knew that as soon as they set up their tents, a Kazakh ran over panting and said, "Oh dear, there are snake dens under the roots of the mountains here, you can't set up tents!"
    Those ten days or so were spent with their hearts on edge. The shadow of poisonous snakes never left them day and night.
    The "Heaven" in Tianshan is truly aptly named, so high that people can't breathe, and their legs feel as heavy as if they were hung with a weight. Looking up, the stones and trees seemed to be connected so steeply, and heavy stones weighing hundreds of pounds often fell from above. When passing Ayouda Ban (mountain pass), someone watched helplessly as a marmot was smashed and its brains burst. Looking down - who dares to look down! Ten thousand feet below are ice caves, and in the caves are rolling black water. It takes a long time for a stone to fall to the ground; if you shout, the echo is much louder than your own voice. They felt dizzy, and their hearts thumped....
    However, one day, on such a steep mountain, they met a group of cattle; the herder was a Kazakh woman, she was riding a horse, holding a baby just over one year old in her arms, and calmly arranging her hair with the other hand. Behind the woman sat an eight or nine-year-old girl, holding her mother's waist with one hand and playing with something in the other. There was also a boy of about ten years old, riding a horse and holding a snow-white lamb in his arms. They were probably changing pastures. The yurt was also carried on the horse's back. Now the people in the team felt ashamed, and everyone said: As long as you don't lose heart, no matter how high it is, you don't have to be afraid.
    Just being fearless is not enough, what about the three flocks of sheep? Sheep like to climb high the most. They don't know that the mountain is terribly high. To be considerate of the herders, they still climb up and down. As long as one sheep in the flock climbs up, the shepherd has to follow it and call it back, otherwise it will climb higher and higher and be even harder to find. The sheep at the top will also kick stones down with their hooves. But as soon as this one is called back, the other one goes up again. Walking sixty li a day is actually equivalent to walking one hundred and twenty.
    Sheep are most afraid of their hooves being worn out. Once they are worn out, they will naturally limp. But how can the hooves not be worn out on such mountain roads? Think of a way. When crossing the mountain, put "shoes" on the sheep, using a kind of leather cover to wrap the sheep's hooves. This kind of cover will be worn through in a day or two. Later, when there was no leather to make covers, everyone cut down their own clothes.
    What about the carriages? Those two carriages were no less worry than the sheep. Originally, big carriages had never been driven on the Tianshan Mountains. The mountains were too steep, and the roads that could be walked were less than two feet wide, with cliffs and ice caves below. It was impossible to use horses to pull them, for fear that the horses would retreat and the carriage would overturn. What to do? First, they were carried by people, and the people carrying them felt dizzy, and their faces were pale with fright. At this time, someone said the only disheartened sentence along the way: "Can we transport it? If we can't transport it, we'll lose our lives here in the end!" Someone nearby heard and quickly said: No matter how steep the mountain is, there are no enemy artillery fire next to it! But how did our volunteers transport artillery to Shangganling? Wasn't it just by relying on a burst of energy!
    With this said, everyone's mood turned around; so, a solution was found.
    They tied a fifty or sixty-meter-long rope to the carriage shaft and pulled it from above; as the carriage moved forward, they slowly continued the rope. To prevent the horse from retreating, the leader Hadi volunteered to drive the shaft, letting the horse pull in front, so that he wouldn't be afraid of it retreating. When encountering particularly narrow mountain roads, like Tengger Daban, they disassembled the carriage and carried it over.
    The carriage became a sensation in the deep valleys of the Tianshan Mountains. Everyone who saw it felt it was novel. After the carriage passed, the herdsmen also bent down to carefully observe the traces left by the carriage.
    Inner Mongolia is cold enough, but it is obviously far from comparable to this place. In the middle of June, some people's ears were frozen, and every morning when they woke up, the tent was always frozen with more than an inch of frost and snow, making a "peng peng" sound when knocked. In order to avoid damaging the tents, the transportation team always waited for the sun to come out before daring to dismantle them.
    The problem of firewood was really not simple. When it rained, the horse manure got wet and could not start a fire, and everyone had to go hungry after climbing a mountain all day.
    Water was hard to see, and even if you saw it, you might not be able to drink it, because there was a kind of swamp that was almost a trap, and even if a sheep stepped on it, it would not be able to pull its legs out. When passing Yakesitai Daban, people would suddenly sink into the flat grassland.
    Once you get to a ferry, there is plenty of water, but there is too much.
    When it rains in the hinterland, there are mountain floods; Xinjiang has snow mountains, and as soon as the weather clears, there will inevitably be mountain floods rushing down from the mountain passes. What kind of mountain floods are those! The power is so great that it can destroy anything. The river is not big, usually no more than three or five zhang wide and three chi deep; the widest Latan River is twelve zhang wide and four chi deep. However, walking in the river, riding on a horse, the horse doesn't have to move its legs, and the people and horses will move. A stone weighing more than ten kilograms will immediately spin when dropped. Once they saw a couple sitting in a big carriage, each holding a baby. When the mountain flood came, it immediately overturned the carriage, and the child in the woman's arms was washed away. She herself was spinning in the whirlpool. The man let go of the baby in his arms, grabbed a big tree that was drifting down, and tried to struggle over to save his wife. Everyone saw this and immediately rushed to rescue the child from the rapids at the risk of their lives; they put him on the saddle and rubbed his little belly for a long time before he woke up.
    If sheep jump into such rapids, even ten thousand of them will be washed away. All the way, people had to be sent ahead to survey the road, looking for places where the water was narrow and gentle and the riverbed did not hurt their feet. After finding a good ferry, use a lasso to probe the depth, and then start building a "bridge" for the sheep: place lying ox stones one by one in the middle of the river, and then carry some fallen dry branches from the primitive forest and tie them to the lying ox stones. This is not enough. Sixteen or seventeen people stand in a row next to the stones, forming a flesh bridge. So, 1,400 sheep were passed one by one from the hands of these sixteen or seventeen people, 1,400 of them! It takes at least four hours to stand. For four hours, people's legs are soaked in ice and snow, biting water; sometimes the current is too fast, and those standing in the middle of the river have to tie themselves to dry branches. After the sheep were passed, people's legs were also frozen and numb, shivering all over; their hands and feet were bumped blue and purple by the sheep's horns during the transfer.
    Once, while transferring, a sheep jumped into the water from a crack in the crowd. At this time, veterinarian Xin Zhongzhi, who was standing in the water with the workers, rushed into the rapids regardless of everything and grabbed the sheep's horns. The mountain flood was too fierce, and Xin Zhongzhi was about to be washed away, and other comrades rushed over to grab his hand. The people behind rushed to grab that person's hand... In this way, everyone was linked into a chain, and the mountain flood did not succeed. Afterwards, someone said to Xin Zhongzhi: "It was really dangerous!" But this taciturn and unsmiling young veterinarian only said: "It's worth it, the sheep wasn't washed away."
    Wolves are truly vicious animals. On July 12th, when passing through Tonggeligedaban, there was a Kazakh herdsman not far from their camp. The day before, he was still the owner of more than a hundred sheep, but overnight, those more than a hundred sheep turned into a pile of bones, leaving him with only one goat.
    When passing through a forest in the Yakbo area, they saw a group of wolves chasing two antelopes from a distance. Before long, they all disappeared into the forest. From then on, they paid more attention to guarding against wolves. The first thing they did every day when they arrived at the camp was to count the sheep. It was really enough to count 1,400 sheep, and they were always worried. After counting, they handed it over to the comrades on night watch. Night watch is a very difficult job, but it is also a very important job. In the dark of night, he braved the wind and snow on the plateau to guard the sheep, shouting at the top of his voice - to scare the wolves.
    Storms often occur in the Tianshan Mountains. As soon as ladder clouds appear in the sky, a storm is about to come. Wolves take advantage of this opportunity, frantically attacking in the storm. At this time, sheep are also most likely to mingle with other flocks. Every day when choosing a campsite, they always have to see if there is a way to hide from the storm; whether there are many wolves around; and if people fall off the mountain, there is a way to save them.
    It was really full of hardships. Seeing that they were about to reach Urumqi, they also passed through a poisonous grass beach for two days. Animals will lose their lives if they eat this kind of grass. What to do? I had to rush at night and walk more than a hundred miles in one breath. Only Xinjiang sheep with such a strong physique can withstand it!
    The camps are always three tents in a triangle, with the sheep in the middle. Horses don't sleep at night, they guard around. There was a Mongolian worker named Tu Ke Tu, he usually didn't allow others to fire guns, but one day when he saw a wolf, he fired a shot, scaring the horse and running away. Tu Ke Tu became anxious. He groped in the dark and searched all over the mountains all night, not caring about being afraid. By dawn, he actually found it back. (To be continued)

    万里赶羊
    本报特约记者　萧乾
    “10月末，内蒙古自治区锡林郭勒草原上的母羊，全面开始定期配种。预计明年清明前后，将繁殖一百多万只小羊。这几天，经过训练的一批人工授精技术员先后到达了各旗准备给配种。
    “锡林郭勒草原的羊产毛量较低，毛质粗糙。因此，内蒙古自治区今年运进了一千多只新疆细毛种羊，和蒙古羊进行配种。明春这里将出现杂种细毛羊羔。”11月5日的“人民日报”上，发表了这样一条消息。你想，新疆和内蒙古，这两个自治区，相隔有多么远？交通又多么不便？可是，新疆的细毛种羊却被“运进”内蒙古自治区了。
    是怎样“运进”的呢？
    过去从新疆西部运羊，不是用飞机就是由伊犁装汽车。这批羊可不是那样运的，它们是先被“吆运”（人赶着羊走）到乌鲁木齐，然后才装汽车、搭火车运来的。运羊的同志们从新疆西部巩留县的巩乃斯羊坊出发，先是徒步赶着那一千四百只羊爬过十二座高达四千公尺的大雪山，渡过一百多个山洪肆虐的河口，踏过苇塘和沼泽，穿过人类足迹从来没有到过的原始森林，穿过毒蛇区、毒草滩，战胜了狼群和熊群，七十五天，到达了乌鲁木齐。然后，又在汽车和火车的运输过程中克服了重重难以想像的困难。他们走过五个省、两个自治区，经历了一万一千五百里的路程，把这此细毛种羊“运”到了内蒙古草原。
    为什么要这样做呢？
    这样做，比起来用飞机运，给国家节省了将近五万元；这样做，使羊的体质受了一番锻炼，并且平均每头羊加了五公斤膘。
    我在呼和浩特访问了内蒙古自治区畜牧厅派到新疆去买羊的干部，特别是领队哈迪同志。他们的谈话，真是令人感奋的诗篇。从他们办这件事的经历中，我们可以了解到，在我们的国家里，有怎样忠于职守的干部，怎样热爱祖国的人民！
    “走天山！”这是个大胆的决定，豪迈的决定。在拿定主意以前，六个干部和二十七个临时找来的工人心里不是没有好嘀咕一阵。好家伙，从来没有人赶这么多羊走过这一千四百里终年不化的雪山！人病了怎么办？羊要是拐了腿怎么办？许多疑难纠缠着他们。
    天秤总是有两端。一端是难以估计的困难（有些困难是现实的，有些是化装出来的）；另外一端呢，是“吆运”对国家、对羊的好处。这具天秤就在他们每个人心里摆上摆下。新疆的畜牧厅厅长达夏甫说：“干吧！羊是结结实实的羊，你们中间又有放羊的老手，场里给你们找个好向导。”羊场的哈萨克族同志不容分说就动手替他们画起了路线图。
    好吧，走天山。
    于是，他们先把一千零五十只母羊和三百五十只公羊分成三个赶运组。每组一个兽医干部，四个工人，负责大约五百只羊。公羊喜欢彼此顶撞，撞出伤来转天就会生蛆，一般人宁愿管三只母羊，不愿管一只公羊。可是，兽医辛仲直主动提出来要负责这一组。这以外，还有炊事组。队里有蒙古、汉、回和哈萨克四个民族，大家同意一路上全跟着回族同志吃，炊事也完全由他们管。炊事组不但管做饭，还管拣柴和拉病羊。还有驮运组。行李，帐篷和粮食都得想法运。他们最初想雇几个新疆老乡赶着牲口驮，可是一划算得花五千元，还得给他们回去的盘费。不行，还是花三千来块钱买了二十四匹马。估计到了乌鲁木齐可以原价卖出去，不是又给国家省了一笔钱吗？
    为了保证病人不至于掉队，病羊不至于损失，他们还买了两辆四轮马车。天山上赶马车，这是没听过的奇闻。许多当地老乡都拦他们，说山路窄得连两只羊都不能并着走，怎么能带车呀！可是他们决定还是带上。当然，他们一点也没料到这两辆大车给他们造成的困难。
    6月14日那天，他们就跟着羊场的老工人乌木耳浩浩荡荡地出发了。
    头一关就是毒蛇。从6月14日到27日，他们走的全是毒蛇区。哎唷，那真是个蛇的世界，没腰的草棵里，遍地都是几尺长的花蛇，曲曲弯弯地爬行着，有时候还挺起长颈子来朝人险恶地吐着芯子。一个赶羊的工人热了，把大褂脱下来放一放，等会儿去拿的时候，已经沉甸甸地钻进好几条蛇了。一天晚上有匹马挨了一口，不大工夫它就浑身发黄，过会儿就倒下死了。
    过毒蛇区，他们心里只有一个念头：随便怎样也不能叫羊给蛇咬住。他们走在羊群前头，手里攥着把鞭子，一路上响亮地抽着，抽得山里发出尖峭的回响。
    白天好办，晚上一宿营就困难了。他们总是很小心地侦查地势，看蛇窝多不多。20日那天，他们挑了个非常漂亮的地方，叫伊士布拉克（“三个泉眼”），以为可以受不到毒蛇的威胁了。谁知道，刚搭好帐篷，一个哈萨克人气喘喘地跑了来，说：“啊呀，这儿山根儿底下全是蛇窝，可搭不得帐篷！”
    那十几天的日子过得心里可紧得慌，毒蛇的影子日日夜夜一直也没离开过他们。
    天山这个“天”字叫得可是真妙，高得人张嘴喘不上气来，腿沉得就像挂了个秤铊。往上看，石头跟石头、树跟树就好像接起来似的那么陡，上面还常掉几百斤重的大石头下来。过阿优达板（山口子）的时候，有人眼睁睁看见一只旱獭子给砸得脑浆迸裂。往下看呢——谁敢往下看呀！万丈之下尽是冰窟窿，窟窿里是滚滚的黑水，丢一块石头要好半天才能落地；喊一声，回音要比自己的声音大多了。他们头晕，心噗咚噗咚地蹦……。
    可是，有一天，就在这样陡的山上他们遇见一群牛；放牛的是个哈萨克女人，她骑在马上，怀里抱着个刚满周岁的娃娃，另一只手还从容地理着头发。女人后边坐着个八九岁的女孩，她一手抱着妈妈的腰，一手还在玩着什么。另外还有个十来岁的男孩，他骑着马，手里搂着一只雪白的羊羔。他们大约是在换牧场。马背上还驮着蒙古包。这下队上的人可觉得惭愧了，大家都说：只要自己不泄气，多么高也用不着怕。
    光不怕还不成，那三群羊呢？羊最喜欢爬高。它们不知道这山高得可怕，体贴体贴放牧的人，它们照样爬上爬下。只要羊群里有一只羊爬上去了，管羊的就得跟上去，把它叫回来，不然的话它越趴越高，就更不好找回来了。高处的羊还会用蹄子往下蹬石头。可是，刚把这只叫回来，那只又上去了。一天要走六十里路，实际上就等于走一百二。
    羊就怕把蹄子磨烂了，一烂自然就拐。可是走那样的山路，蹄子怎么能不烂呢？想办法呗。过山的时候就给羊“穿鞋”，用一种皮套子裹在羊蹄子上。这种套子用不上一两天就磨通了。后来没皮子做套子了，大家把自己的衣服割下来。
    车呢？那两辆车一点儿也不比羊省心。本来嘛，天山上从来没走过大车。山太陡了，能走的路不到二尺宽，下面就是悬崖和冰窟窿。不能用马拉，怕马往后一退，车翻了。怎么办好呢？先是用人抬，抬的人头发晕，脸吓得惨白惨白的。这时候有人说出一路上唯一的一句泄气话：“运得过去吗？运不过去临完再把命送在这儿！”旁边有人听见，赶快说：山再怎么陡，旁边总没敌人的炮火吧！可是咱们志愿军怎么把大炮运到上甘岭上去的，还不是就靠股干劲儿！
    这么一说，大家的情绪扭转过来了；于是，办法也就想出来了。
    他们把五六十公尺长的绳子拴在车辕上，从上面拽着它；车往前走，上面慢慢续绳子。为了怕马退，领队的哈迪自告奋勇来驾辕，让马在前头拉，这样就不怕它退了。遇到特别窄的山路，像腾格尔达板，就把车拆散，抬过去。
    车在天山深谷里可出了风头啦，当地人谁看见了谁都觉得新奇。车走过去了，牧民还弯下腰去细细察看大车留下的印迹。
    内蒙古够冷了，可是比起这地方来显然还差得远。大六月天，有人耳朵都冻坏了，每天早晨起来，帐篷总冻上一寸多厚的霜雪，敲起来??响。为了怕弄坏了帐篷，驮运组总是等太阳出来才敢拆。
    柴禾的问题可真不简单。一下雨，马粪湿了，开不了伙，大家爬了一天山，还得饿肚子。
    水难得看见，而且看见了水不一定喝得到，因为有一种沼泽差不多是陷阱，连羊踏在上面，腿也会拔不出来。过牙克斯台达板的时候，人走在平坦的草原上，忽然会陷进去。
    一到渡口，水倒有的是，就是太多了。
    内地下雨的时候闹山洪；新疆有雪山，天一放晴，有山口子的地方必然得有山洪奔下来。那是怎样的山洪啊！力量大得什么都能摧毁。河并不大，一般的也不过三、五丈宽，三尺来深；顶宽的拉坦河有十二丈宽，四尺多深。可是，走在河里，骑在马上，马不用迈腿，人马就会移动。十几斤的石头，丢下去马上就打转。有一回他们看见一对夫妇坐着辆大车，两个人各抱着个娃娃。山洪来了，立刻把大车冲翻，那个女人怀里的孩子给冲走了，她自己在漩涡里打转。男的撒开怀里的娃娃，搂住一棵漂下来的大树，想挣扎过来救他的妻子。大家看见，马上奋不顾身地把孩子从激流里捞上来；放在马鞍子上，搓揉了好半天他的小肚子，才醒过来。
    这样的激流要是羊跳下去，一万只也给冲没了。一路上总得先派人前头去采路，找水窄而缓、河底不扎脚的地方走。找好了渡口，用套马杆子探探深度，然后动手给羊搭“桥”：把卧牛石一块块排在河当中，再从原始森林里扛来一些倒下来的干树杈，把它们绑在卧牛石上。这还不够。石头旁边一排站上十六七个人，形成一道肉桥。于是，一千四百只羊就一只只地从这十六七个人的手里递传过去，一千四百只哪！起码要站上四个钟头。四个钟头人的腿都泡在冰雪化成的、刺骨的水里；有时候水流得太急了，站在河中间的还得把自己绑在干树杈上。羊传递完了，人的腿也冻得没了知觉，浑身哆嗦；手脚在传递的时候给羊犄角撞得青一块紫一块的。
    有一回，正传递的时候，一只羊从人缝儿里窜下水去了。这时候，跟工人一道站在水里的兽医辛仲直就不顾一切地淌到激流里去，一把抓住了那只羊的犄角。山洪太猛了，眼看辛仲直也要给冲走，另外的同志又淌过来抓他的手。后边的人又赶忙抓那个人的手……这样，大家就连成一道锁链，山洪才没得逞。事后，有人对辛仲直说：“真险哪！”可是，这个寡言笑的青年兽医只说了声：“够本啦，羊总算没给它冲走。”
    狼真是狠恶的动物。7月12日那天，走过通格力戈达板的时候，有个哈萨克牧人离他们宿营的地方不远。头天他还是一百多只羊的主人，可是过了一夜，那一百多只羊都变成了一堆骨头，只给他剩下一只山羊。
    走过牙克伯地区一道森林的时候，他们远远瞅见一群狼在追两只羚羊。不一会，它们都消失到森林里去了。从那以后，他们对狼更加注意提防了。每天到宿营地头一件事就是数羊。一千四百只羊，真够数的，而且随数随提心吊胆的。数完了，就交给夜里打更的同志。打更是很吃力的活儿，可也是件非常重要的活儿。他黑潦半夜冒着高原的风雪守在羊群旁边，扯开了嗓子吆喝——吓狼。
    天山里头常起风暴。天上一出梯云，就要来风暴。狼这时候趁火打劫，在风暴里猖狂进攻。羊这当儿也最容易羼群。每天选择宿营地，总要看暴风雨来了有法掩蔽没有；周围狼多不多；还有，人如果从山上掉下去，有法儿救没有。
    真是磨难重重呀，眼看就到乌鲁木齐了，还过了两天毒草滩。这种草牲口一吃就没命。怎么办呢？只好连夜赶，一口气走了一百多里。也只有体格这么结实的新疆羊受得了！
    宿营总是三座帐篷作三角形，把羊放在中间。马夜里不睡觉，它们在周围守卫着。有个蒙古族工人叫吐克吐，他平常不许别人放枪，可是有一天看见狼，他放了一枪，把马惊了，还跑掉了一匹。吐克吐这下可急了。他摸着黑儿连夜满山找呀找呀，什么也顾不得怕了。到天亮，居然找回来了。　（未完）
