Liaoning Province's industrial construction projects during the First Five-Year Plan:
Fifty-Four key projects have been put into production

    (Our dispatch) By November 4th this year, fifty-four of the one hundred and twenty-nine key projects above the limit that Liaoning Province started during the First Five-Year Plan have been completed and put into production. It is expected that the number completed by the end of the year will increase to seventy. Among the key projects that have been completed, industrial construction projects have increased the fastest. If the industrial key construction projects in 1952 are taken as 100 percent, then 1953 is 300 percent, 1954 is 500 percent, 1955 is 700 percent, and the first ten months of this year have reached 700 percent. These projects include: machine tool factories with high efficiency that can produce a variety of machine tools, cable factories that can produce more than 10,000 specifications of cables and wires, modern power plants and factories that manufacture pneumatic tools, large-scale coal mine shafts and inclined shafts, and highly mechanized cement plants and pharmaceutical factories. Most of these key projects are rebuilt or newly built. Many projects were completed one month, two months, or even more ahead of schedule.
    The Shenyang Pneumatic Tool Factory, after more than two years of reconstruction, has been transformed from a simple small factory into a modern factory. According to design requirements, its output is 100 times greater than during the Japanese puppet regime. After the reconstruction and putting into production of the Shenyang Cable Factory and the Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Factory, the production capacity will be increased by more than six times after reaching the design level. The Benxi Gongyuan Cement Plant, which was put into production in July this year, will increase its annual output by more than one time after expansion compared to before the reconstruction. In this factory, the places where manual labor was used in the past have all been replaced by semi-automatic and mechanized equipment. The expanded Fushun Power Plant not only provides power for local factories, mines, and urban lighting, but also, through voltage transformation devices, can transmit strong currents to Dalian, Anshan, Shenyang, Benxi, Changchun, and Harbin at any time. Since these newly built and rebuilt projects were put into production, they have created a large amount of wealth for the country. More than one-third of the total industrial output value increased by state-owned factories in the province in 1955 compared to 1952 was created by these enterprises. The key projects within the 156 projects that have been put into production in the four regions of Anshan, Fushun, Benxi, and Fuxin have created nearly 500 million yuan of wealth for the country in the first ten months of this year. The completion of these key projects has also provided a large number of industrial products to many regions across the country, supporting the construction of various regions. The rebuilt Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Factory has now provided various new A62-type lathes to more than 200 units across the country. The Shenyang Cable Factory has signed supply contracts with 750 units, and many factories, mines, power stations, reservoirs, and agricultural cooperatives have erected cables and wires produced by this factory. The reason why these projects can be put into production so quickly and create such a huge amount of wealth for the country is mainly due to the strong assistance from the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries, as well as the support from many fraternal enterprises across the country in terms of manpower, equipment, and materials.

    五年计划中辽宁省的工业建设项目
    已有五十四项重点工程投入生产
    本报讯　辽宁省在第一个五年计划期间动工的一百二十九项限额以上的重点工程，到今年11月4日，已有五十四项完工并投入生产。预计到年底，完工的将增加到七十个。在已完工的重点工程中，工业建设项目增加速度最快。如果以1952年的工业重点建设项目为百分之一百，那么1953年为百分之三百，1954年为百分之五百，1955年为百分之七百，今年头十个月已达到百分之七百。这些工程包括：效率很高，可以生产多种机床的机床厂，可以生产一万多种规格电缆和电线的电缆厂，近代化的发电厂和制造风动工具的工厂，规模巨大的煤矿竖井和斜井，机械化程度很高的水泥厂和制药厂等。这些重点工程，绝大部分是改建和新建的。许多工程都是提前一个月，两个月或更多的时间建成的。
    沈阳风动工具厂，经过两年多的改建，已由一个简陋的小工厂变成一座现代化的工厂。按设计要求，它的产量比日伪统治时期大一百倍。经过改建并已投入生产的沈阳电缆厂和沈阳第一机床厂达到设计水平后，生产能力都将提高六倍以上。今年7月投入生产的本溪工源水泥厂，经过扩建后年产量将比改建前提高一倍多。在这个工厂里，过去用体力劳动的地方，已经全部被半自动化和机械化的设备所代替。扩建后的阜新发电厂发电能力不仅能供应当地工厂、矿山以动力和城市照明的用电，同时，经过变压装置，还可以随时把强大的电流输送给旅大、鞍山、沈阳、本溪、长春和哈尔滨等地。这些新建和改建的工程投入生产以来，已为国家创造了大量财富。全省国营工厂工业1955年比1952年增加的总产值中三分之一以上是这些企业创造出来的。鞍山、抚顺、本溪和阜新四个地区已投入生产的属于一百五十六项以内的重点工程，在今年头十个月就给国家创造了近五亿元的财富。这些重点工程的建成，也向全国许多地区提供了大量的工业品，支援了各地的建设。改建后的沈阳第一机床厂目前已为全国二百多个单位提供了一A六二等各种新式车床。沈阳电缆厂和七百五十个单位签订了供货合同，许多工厂、矿山、发电站、水库、农业合作社都架设了这个工厂生产的电缆和电线。这些工程所以能够这样快地投入生产并为国家创造出这样巨大的财富主要是由于苏联和各人民民主国家的大力援助，以及全国各地许多兄弟企业人力、设备、资材等方面的支援。
