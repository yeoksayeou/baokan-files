Xinhua News Agency, 31st — The China Sugar and Pastry Company recently held a national supply conference together with production departments to arrange for the supply of goods for the first and second quarters of next year.

    The conference focused on examining the severe out-of-stock situation of milk powder and brown sugar. It was believed that this was caused by the insufficient understanding of market changes during this year's peak season by business departments in various regions, which led to a reduction in milk powder purchases. The conference planned to increase the supply of milk powder in the first and second quarters of next year by more than 70% compared to the same period this year, and prepared to appropriately increase some imported milk powder to meet market needs.

    At this supply conference, free selection was also carried out for candies, biscuits, milk substitutes, soda, and other small foods. Everyone was most enthusiastic about selecting commodities that were of good quality, low price, and beautifully packaged. People showed no interest in commodities that were of low quality, high price, and poorly packaged.

    安排奶粉等供应工作
    新华社31日讯　中国糖业糕点公司最近和生产部门一起举行了全国供应会议，安排明年第一、二季度的货源。
    会议着重检查了目前奶粉和红糖两种商品严重脱销的情况，认为这是由于各地业务部门对今年旺季市场变化认识不足，缩小了对奶粉的进货所造成的。会议计划明年第一、二季度奶粉的供应量将比今年同期增加70％以上，并准备适当增加部分进口奶粉，以适应市场需要。
    这次供应会议上，还对糖果、饼干、代乳粉、汽水和其他小食品进行了自由选购。大家对质量优良、价格便宜、包装美观的商品，选购最踊跃。一些质量低，价格高、包装次的商品，大家都不感兴趣。
