    On "Dragging in Objectivity"
    Huang Tao

    Some people like to emphasize objective difficulties. For things that can obviously be done, they put on a distressed face, making it seem like there are numerous difficulties. And when they haven't done a good job because of their own lack of effort, they often far-fetchedly attribute it to various objective reasons during self-criticism, blaming everything and excusing their faults, as if everything is unrelated to them. This phenomenon is usually called "dragging in objectivity" or "emphasizing objective difficulties." It is right to give due criticism to these people who "drag in objectivity" in order to promote work.

    However, in actual work, many people, especially some unit leaders, have abused this term, so that the so-called "dragging in objectivity" has become a shield for them to shirk responsibility. For example, when a superior issues an order or makes an arrangement, and the subordinate encounters difficult problems during implementation due to unclear thinking or infeasibility, and asks for help in solving them, the answer often received is: "Don't drag in objectivity, overcome the difficulties yourself." When workers in some factories hold production meetings to examine the reasons for not completing the plan, and some people point out some shortcomings in the leadership and management, they will be immediately stopped: "Don't drag in objectivity, the main thing is to examine yourselves." Even some factories blindly promote certain operational experiences, increasing the workers' labor intensity to the point of harming their health, and when workers raise objections, the answer they get is: "Don't drag in objectivity, you'll be fine once you're skilled." It seems that the leaders of these units believe that the orders they issue are 100% correct, and the arrangements they make are bound to be feasible. If anyone raises objections or fails to do well, then that is "dragging in objectivity" and "emphasizing objective difficulties."

    Thus, whoever is blamed for "dragging in objectivity" or "emphasizing objective difficulties" is tantamount to being criticized for lacking a sense of responsibility, failing to effectively implement the leadership's instructions, and having weak organizational discipline... Ultimately, this person has ideological problems! Over time, subordinates no longer offer opinions, and the masses no longer talk about their difficulties. Sometimes, even if things are infeasible, they have to bite the bullet and do them, "knowing that it cannot be done, yet doing it anyway." And for the leaders, because they have blocked the mouths of their subordinates, they have developed problems of subjectivism and commandism, leading to detachment from the masses, detachment from reality, and damage to the work.

    Of course, it cannot be said that any opinions raised by subordinates and the masses in their work are correct. However, the situation is generally one of the following three: one is correct, which should naturally be listened to; another is a mixture of right and wrong, in which case the correct part can be accepted and the wrong part criticized; the third is indeed purely "dragging in objectivity" and "emphasizing objective difficulties," but it is still worth listening to, making a specific analysis, explaining the reasons to the subordinates, and giving appropriate criticism and education, thereby improving their understanding. In short, regardless of the situation, the practice of indiscriminately and without investigation and research, rejecting everything with two sentences, is a big problem.

    Respecting the objective and proceeding from objective reality is one of the characteristics of the Marxist-Leninist way of thinking and working. If a leader dislikes or even refuses to let subordinates offer opinions, and readily dismisses them as "dragging in objectivity" and "emphasizing objective difficulties," the result is that the "objective" disappears, leaving only the subjective. Then what kind of Marxist-Leninist is that?

### 谈“拉客观”

    谈“拉客观”
    黄涛
    有些人，喜欢强调客观困难，对明明可以办得通的事情，摆出一付为难的面孔，看来真像是困难重重；而当他们由于自己努力不够、没有把工作做好的时候，检查起来，又常常是生拉硬扯地归咎于各种各样的客观原因，怨天尤人，文过饰非，一切好像同自己无关。这种现象，人们通常称之为“拉客观”或“强调客观困难”。对于这种“拉客观”的人，给以应得的批评，从而推动工作，原是对的。
    但是，在实际工作中，却有不少人，特别是有些单位的领导者，滥用了这个名词，以致所谓“拉客观”竟也成为他们推卸责任的挡箭牌。比如，当上级有所命令或布置之后，下级在执行中由于思想不明确或行不通而提出一些困难问题，要求帮助解决的时候，得到的回答往往就是：“不要拉客观，有困难自己去克服”；有些工厂工人开生产会议检查完不成计划的原因，有些人提出了一些有关领导工作、管理工作上的缺点，就又会马上被制止：“不要拉客观，主要的是检查自己”；甚至有的工厂盲目推广某种操作经验，增加了工人的劳动强度，以至损害工人健康，而当工人提出意见的时候，得到的回答又是：“不要拉客观，熟练了就好了。”看来，这些单位的领导者认定自己所下的命令都是百分之百地正确的，布置的事情是必然办得通的，谁如果提出意见，谁如果办不好，那就是“拉客观”，“强调客观困难”。
    于是谁受到了“拉客观”“强调客观困难”的责备，谁就等于受到了缺乏责任心、贯彻执行领导指示不力、组织性纪律性不强……的批评，归根结蒂，这个人思想意识有问题！久而久之，下级有意见也不提了，群众有困难也不讲了，有时候即使事情行不通，也只好硬着头皮去做，“知其不可为而为之”。而在领导者，由于堵塞了下级的口，也就产生了主观主义和命令主义的毛病，以致脱离群众，脱离实际，损害工作。
    当然，决不能说下级和群众在工作中提出的任何意见都是正确的。但是，情况总不外下列三种：一种是正确的，那自然应当听取；另一种是非掺杂，则可以接受其对的部分，批判其错的部分；第三种倒真是纯属“拉客观”、“强调客观困难”的，但也不妨倾听一下，经过具体分析，向下级说明道理，给以适当的批评教育，从而提高他们的认识。总之，不管什么情况，那种不分青红皂白、不经调查研究、一概用两句话打回去的做法，是大成问题的。
    尊重客观，从客观实际出发，是马克思列宁主义的思想方法和工作方法的特征之一。一个领导者，如果厌恶以至拒绝下级提意见，动辄斥之为“拉客观”“强调客观困难”，结果是“客观”没有了，只剩下主观，那还成为什么马克思列宁主义者呢？
