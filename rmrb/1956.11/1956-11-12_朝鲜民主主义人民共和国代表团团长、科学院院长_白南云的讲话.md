Dear Comrades, Esteemed Guests:

The Korean delegation feels infinitely honored to participate in the celebration of the 90th anniversary of the birth of Mr. Sun Yat-sen and extends warm congratulations.

The great October Socialist Revolution established the first socialist country in the world, opening a new era in the development of human society. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people established the People's Republic of China, inheriting and developing this revolution. This is a revolutionary victory of world historical significance. It is not only a guarantee of the eternal happiness and interests of the Chinese people, but also creates absolutely favorable political conditions for guaranteeing the freedom and independence of the world's oppressed nations, fundamentally bankrupting the colonial policies of Western imperialist powers in enslaving the East and the so-called Far East policy of the United States.

I believe that the source of thought for the Chinese revolutionary movement, which enabled the great Chinese revolution to achieve historic victory, is inseparable from Mr. Sun Yat-sen's 40 years of revolutionary struggle.

Mr. Sun Yat-sen's life was indeed one of consistently carrying out democratic revolutionary struggles, a life of courageous anti-imperialist and anti-feudal struggles, a life that demonstrated a high degree of patriotism in building a new China, and a life that displayed an indomitable fighting spirit for freedom and equality.

Mr. Sun Yat-sen's great idea of a world united on the basis of peace, freedom, equality, and democracy is the same as today's idea of safeguarding world peace. Mr. Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary struggle thoughts were not only limited to China but also closely linked to the people of the world who were suffering from imperialist aggression and oppression. He advocated using common action to help each other to liberate all the oppressed nations of the world.

As everyone knows, Mr. Sun Yat-sen sent a telegram to Mr. Lenin congratulating him on the success of the October Socialist Revolution. Later, Mr. Sun Yat-sen was determined to guide the Chinese revolution along the direction of the October Revolution. By the end of 1923, Mr. Sun Yat-sen established the world-famous Three Great Policies of alliance with Russia, alliance with the Communist Party, and assistance to workers and peasants. We also clearly remember that he advocated reorganizing the Kuomintang and taught Chiang Kai-shek that the Chinese revolution could not succeed if it did not take the Soviet Union as its teacher.

However, the Chiang Kai-shek clique, which fled to part of Chinese territory—Taiwan, deliberately distorted the Three Principles of the People, spreading the absurd argument that nationalism and communism are absolutely incompatible. This is completely an act of treachery. The Li Seung-man gang spare no effort to sell out South Korea's underground resources, cultural relics, and even hard-working people to satisfy the desires of American aggressors. They formed the so-called "Special Second National Army" and supplied young adults aged twenty-seven to thirty-three to American imperialism as imperialist cannon fodder, frantically increasing military spending. Recently, he has even more blatantly clamored for the so-called Northern Expedition, which is very similar to Chiang Kai-shek's methods.

The Korean people clearly remember that Mr. Sun Yat-sen not only repeatedly clarified during his lifetime that the Principle of People's Livelihood is socialism and that communism is the best friend of the Principle of People's Livelihood, but he also praised the victory of the great October Revolution and the superiority of the Soviet state system.

The Li Seung-man gang has consistently carried out malicious propaganda saying that nationalism and communism are incompatible. The Korean people criticized Li Seung-man for selling out the nation and falsely claiming so-called nationalism. We not only welcome genuine nationalists with a conscience but also absorb them into our united democratic front for national reunification and further strengthen mutual assistance and cooperation with them. This is the result of our learning from the Chinese example. The friendship and unity between the Korean and Chinese people not only has a long historical tradition, but also, during our Fatherland Liberation War, was forged with blood into an eternal brotherly friendship. The Korean people believe that when imperialist aggressors still threaten world peace, the brotherly unity between the Korean and Chinese people will be further consolidated. The Korean people stand with the Chinese people against war and advocate peace. But we are not afraid of the imperialist aggressors' tricks of playing with fire. The entire Korean people yearn for the peaceful reunification of North and South Korea, which is inseparable from the revolutionary task of socialist industrialization in North Korea. If it were not for the material and spiritual assistance of the various countries of the peaceful, democratic, and socialist camp headed by the great Soviet Union and China, the Korean people's revolutionary tasks would not be completed.

Dear Comrades! Esteemed Guests!

Mr. Sun Yat-sen, the pioneer of the Chinese revolution, anti-imperialist and anti-feudal struggles, his internationalist ideal of a united world, and his idea of an equal and mutually beneficial foreign policy of peace are not only the source of the Chinese people's revolutionary thought, but have in fact developed into a powerful world peace policy and become a decisive tool for preventing imperialist warmongers from attempting to start fires. It will also greatly encourage the revolutionary struggle of the Korean people.

The Korean delegation believes that through this commemorative meeting, the friendly relations between the peace-loving people of the world will be further developed. The spirit of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence advocated by the People's Republic of China will be praised by more people. I once again extend my heartfelt congratulations to the 90th anniversary of the birth of Mr. Sun Yat-sen, the pioneer of the Chinese revolution.

### 朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表团团长、科学院院长  白南云的讲话

    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表团团长、科学院院长
    白南云的讲话亲爱的同志们：各位来宾：
    朝鲜代表团能够参加孙中山先生诞辰九十周年纪念典礼，感到无限光荣，并致以热烈的祝贺。
    伟大的十月社会主义革命，在世界上建立了第一个社会主义国家，开辟了人类社会发展的新纪元。中国人民在中国共产党的领导下，建立了中华人民共和国，继承和发展了这种革命。这是具有世界历史意义的革命胜利。它不仅是中国人民永远幸福和利益的保证，而且为保证世界被压迫民族的自由和独立，创造了绝对有利的政治条件，使西方帝国主义列强奴役东方的殖民政策和美国的所谓远东政策根本破产。
    我认为，使伟大的中国革命，获得历史性胜利的中国革命运动思想的泉源，是和孙中山先生四十年来的革命斗争事业分不开的。
    孙中山先生的一生，的确是一贯进行民主革命斗争的一生，是进行勇敢的反帝反封建的斗争，发挥了建设新中国高度的爱国主义精神的一生，是为自由和平等而显示了百折不屈的斗志的一生。
    孙中山先生以和平、自由、平等和民主为基础的世界大团结的伟大思想，和今天维护世界和平的思想是相同的。孙中山先生的革命斗争思想，不仅仅局限于中国，而且和受着帝国主义侵略与压迫的全世界人民有着紧密的联系。他曾主张以共同行动办法，互相帮助，来解放全世界被压迫民族。
    大家都知道，孙中山先生曾给列宁先生打电报祝贺十月社会主义革命的成功。后来，孙中山先生，决心沿着十月革命的方向引导中国革命，到1923年末，孙中山先生确定了世界著名的联俄、联共、扶助工农的三大政策。我们还清楚地记得，他曾主张改组国民党，并教导蒋介石说：中国革命如不以苏联为师就决不能胜利。
    可是逃到中国领土的一部分——台湾的蒋介石集团，却故意歪曲三民主义，散布民族主义和共产主义好像是决不能相容的荒谬的论调。这完全是背信弃义的行为。李承晚匪帮为了满足美国侵略者的欲望不惜出卖南朝鲜的地下资源、文化遗物甚至勤劳的人民。他们组成所谓“特殊第二国民兵”把二十七岁到三十三岁的青壮年供给美帝国主义，充当帝国主义炮灰，疯狂增加军费。最近，他更加露骨地叫嚣所谓北进战争，这一点，很像蒋介石的手法。
    朝鲜人民清楚地记得：孙中山先生生前不仅屡次阐明：民生主义就是社会主义，共产主义是民生主义最好的朋友，而且他还称赞了伟大的十月革命的胜利和苏联国家制度的优越性。
    李承晚匪帮一贯进行恶意宣传说：民族主义和共产主义是互不相容的。朝鲜人民抨击了李承晚出卖民族冒名顶替所谓的民族主义。对真正有良心的民族主义者，我们不但欢迎，而且吸收他们参加我们祖国统一民主战线，更加加强与他们之间的互助合作。这是我们学习了中国的典范的结果。朝中两国人民的友谊团结，不仅具有悠久的历史传统，而且在我们祖国解放战争时期，又用鲜血结成了永久不灭的兄弟般的友谊。朝鲜人民相信：当帝国主义侵略者还威胁着世界和平的时候，朝中两国人民的兄弟般的团结，将会得到进一步的巩固。朝鲜人民和中国人民一起，反对战争主张和平。但是我们并不怕帝国主义侵略者玩火的把戏。全体朝鲜人民渴望南北朝鲜的和平统一，这和朝鲜北部社会主义工业化的革命任务是分不开的。假如没有以伟大的苏联和中国为首的和平民主社会主义阵营各个国家的物质和精神上的帮助，朝鲜人民的革命任务是无法完成的。
    亲爱的同志们！来宾们！
    中国革命的先驱者孙中山先生的反帝反封建斗争和他的国际主义的世界大同团结思想以及平等互惠的对外和平政策思想，不仅是中国人民革命思想的泉源，而且实际上已发展成为强有力的世界和平政策，成为防止帝国主义战争贩子企图纵火的决定性的工具。它也将大大地鼓舞朝鲜人民的革命斗争。
    朝鲜代表团相信：通过这次的纪念大会，世界爱好和平人民之间的友谊关系，将得到进一步的发展。中华人民共和国所倡导的五项原则精神，将得到更多人的赞扬。我对中国革命的先驱者——孙中山先生的诞辰九十周年纪念大会，再一次致以衷心的祝贺。
