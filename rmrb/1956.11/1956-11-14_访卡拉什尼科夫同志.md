    Visiting Comrade Kalashnikov
    Su Fang
    It was already dusk. Comrade Kalashnikov, head of the Soviet film workers delegation, who had been busy all day, was about to attend the celebration of the October Revolution Day in Beijing in a little over an hour, but he still took the time during this short break to receive the few reporters who came to visit him.
    Comrade Kalashnikov is the Deputy Director of the General Administration of Film Production of the Soviet Ministry of Culture. He told us that the Soviet Union will only produce eighty feature films this year, but by 1960, it will strive to produce one hundred and twenty. The rapid increase in the number of films produced requires a corresponding increase in the number of film scripts. To this end, the Soviet Ministry of Culture and the Soviet Writers Association jointly held a film script solicitation to welcome the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution at the end of last year. After the solicitation message was released, many writers and amateur authors participated in this work. The selection committee regularly receives scripts sent from various places, and it is estimated that several thousand will be received by the end of this year, from which many excellent works can certainly be selected.
    As for how to select, Comrade Kalashnikov said with a smile that it is very interesting and fair. The names of the authors are all sealed. The selection committee decides on acceptance or rejection entirely based on the content and quality of the work. It will never be discarded just because it was written by a young author; nor will it necessarily be selected just because it was written by an old writer. And for talented young authors, even if the script they write for the first time may not be mature enough, the film studio will definitely try its best to help them. For example, send excellent screenwriters to help them revise it, introduce them to writing experience, etc., so that they can gradually master the characteristics of film art and gradually become a skilled screenwriter.
    Comrade Kalashnikov said that the Soviet Union attaches great importance to the breadth of film themes and the diversity of styles. For example, the nearly ninety feature films that the Soviet Union will shoot next year will be very rich in content, including writing about historical events, reflecting the lives of people from all walks of life in the Soviet Union, and masterpieces by great writers such as Pushkin, Tolstoy, and Chekhov will also be brought to the screen. These films do not simply express a certain event, but more importantly, they express the noble spiritual outlook of the Soviet people and the new relationship between people. From the perspective of film style, there will also be different styles such as comedies, musicals, children's films, sports films, and thrillers. Some of these films, such as "Quiet Don," will also be produced as widescreen films.
    Comrade Kalashnikov specifically pointed out that some Western capitalist countries are now producing a large number of widescreen films in order to seize the market and obtain profits. The Soviet Union does not produce many widescreen films now, but the Soviet Union truly hopes to expand the expressive means of film art and improve the quality of film art creation through widescreen films. At present, the Soviet Union has been able to use special effects in widescreen films. For example, when showing war scenes, special effects can be used to truly reflect the magnificent scene of thousands of troops and horses galloping.
    In order to continuously improve the quality of films, the General Administration of Film Production of the Soviet Ministry of Culture and various film studios regularly hold professional meetings. Comrade Kalashnikov told us that the Soviet Union will hold another national film work conference at the end of this year to specifically discuss issues such as directing, acting, and photography. Film workers can fully express their opinions and exchange experiences with each other.
    In order to continuously improve the quality of films, the General Administration of Film Production of the Soviet Ministry of Culture always tries its best to help various film studios solve their difficulties. If some film studios lack actors when filming, the General Administration will draw outstanding actors from other film studios to support them; if some film studios cannot organize the script well when filming, the General Administration will draw experienced directors from other studios to help them. Comrade Kalashnikov himself often goes down to various factories to understand the situation, listen to their opinions, and help them solve various practical difficulties at any time.
    Comrade Kalashnikov repeatedly instructed us to convey his greetings to the Chinese audience. He said that they are grateful to the Chinese audience for their warm welcome.

    访卡拉什尼科夫同志
    苏方
    已经是暮色苍茫的时候了。忙碌了一整天的苏联电影工作者代表团团长卡拉什尼科夫同志虽然在一个多钟头以后又要去参加北京举行的庆祝十月革命节大会，但是他仍在这短暂的休息时间内，接见了我们几个去拜访他的记者。
    卡拉什尼科夫同志是苏联文化部影片生产总管理局的副局长。他告诉我们，苏联今年还只出八十部艺术片，但到1960年，就要争取出一百二十部了。影片制作数量的急骤增加，相应地就要求产生更多的电影文学剧本，为此，去年年底，苏联文化部和苏联作家协会联合举办了为迎接十月革命四十周年电影剧本征文。征文消息发布以后，许多作家和业余作者参加了这一工作。评选委员会经常收到从各地寄来的剧本，估计到今年年底就可以收到好几千个，从中一定可以挑选出很多优秀的作品来。
    至于如何评选，卡拉什尼科夫同志笑着说，这是很有趣、也是很公正的。原来作者的名字都加了密封。评选委员会完全根据作品的内容、质量决定取舍。决不会因为是青年作者写的就弃置不顾；也决不会因为是老作家写的就一定选上。而对于有才华的青年作者，虽然他第一次写出来的剧本可能还不够成熟，电影制片厂也一定尽力想法帮助他，譬如派出优秀的剧作家去帮他进行修改，向他介绍写作经验等，使他能够逐渐掌握电影艺术的特点，逐渐成为一个熟练的编剧。
    卡拉什尼科夫同志说，苏联是非常重视电影题材的广泛性和样式的多样化的。譬如苏联明年将要拍摄的近九十部艺术片，内容就非常丰富，有写历史事件的，有反映苏联各阶层人民的生活的，而伟大的文学家如普希金、托尔斯泰、契呵夫等的名著也将搬上银幕。这些影片，不单纯在表现某一事件，更重要的是在表现苏联人民的崇高的精神面貌，表现新的人与人之间的关系。从影片的风格上看，也将有喜剧片、音乐片、儿童片、体育片、惊险片等不同的样式。其中有些影片如“静静的顿河”等，还将摄制成宽银幕电影。
    卡拉什尼科夫同志特别指出，西方某些资本主义国家现在大量生产宽银幕电影，目的在夺取市场，获得利润。苏联现在生产宽银幕电影的数量还不多，但是苏联却真正希望通过宽银幕电影来扩大电影艺术的表现手段，提高电影艺术创作的质量。目前，苏联已经能够在宽银幕电影中使用特技了。譬如表现战争场面，就可以通过特技把千军万马奔腾的雄伟场面如实地反映出来。
    为了不断提高影片质量，苏联文化部影片生产总管理局和各个电影制片厂经常举行专业性的会议。卡拉什尼科夫同志告诉我们，今年年底苏联又将召开一个全国性的电影工作会议，专门讨论导演、表演、摄影等问题。电影工作者们可以充分发表意见，彼此交流经验。
    为了不断提高影片质量，苏联文化部影片生产总管理局总是尽力帮助各电影制片厂解决困难。有的制片厂拍片时缺少演员，总局就从别的制片厂抽出优秀的演员去支援他们；有的制片厂拍片时导演不能很好地整理剧本，总局就从别的厂抽出有经验的导演去帮助他们。卡拉什尼科夫同志本人就经常下到各个厂去了解情况，听取他们的意见，随时帮助他们解决各种实际困难。
    卡拉什尼科夫同志一再嘱咐我们代为向中国观众致意。他说他们感谢中国观众对他们的热烈欢迎。
