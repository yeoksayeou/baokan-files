Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, November 18th. Party and government leading organs in Chongqing Municipality have taken emergency measures to solve the problem of sewing and supplying winter cotton clothes for citizens.

It is already the cold winter season, but general sewing shops do not accept materials brought in by customers, and even those that do take materials require one to three months to pick up the finished product. According to commercial departments' estimates, the city is short approximately 180,000 winter cotton clothes, and stores have sold out, posing a significant threat to citizens' ability to get through the winter. At the same time, sewing shops do not pay attention to technique, and shoddy workmanship such as short stitches, sparse threads, incorrect cutting, and incorrect sewing are very serious, causing dissatisfaction among citizens.

In order to quickly solve this problem, Ren Baige, Secretary of the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Mayor of Chongqing, and other party and government leaders conducted investigations in sewing production cooperatives. They also invited experienced tailors with more than twenty years of sewing experience, such as Shi Yongkang, Dong Haoran, and Li Tongde, to participate in discussions. The Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened an enlarged meeting of the Standing Committee, including the secretaries of each district committee, the directors of sewing production associations, and relevant cadres, to conduct further careful study and determine the principles for solving this problem. The Fifth Office of the Chongqing Municipal People's Committee and the commercial and handicraft management departments also held multiple meetings to study the issue.

It is understood that the important reason why sewing shops do not accept customer materials for cotton clothes is that the processing tasks assigned by commercial departments and the quantity of self-produced and self-sold goods by sewing production cooperatives are too large. In order to enable sewing cooperatives to free up capacity to accept materials from customers, commercial departments have now reduced processing tasks to only 3.5% of the city's sewing production capacity. The handicraft management department has also determined that sewing production cooperatives should primarily focus on undertaking customer materials in the future. With less processing and customer materials, sewing shops can engage in some self-production and self-sales to adjust production balance. Because citizens urgently need cotton clothes to keep warm, in addition to encouraging sewing shops to actively accept materials, the Chongqing Municipal Commercial and Handicraft Management Departments have begun to uniformly organize forces and tap potential, organizing more than a thousand family members of employees with sewing skills and sewing workers scattered in the streets to rush-produce 100,000 cotton clothes in a short period of time to supply the market. In order to encourage improved quality and technology, it was decided to gradually reform the current wage system and formulate necessary quality inspection and assessment systems.

    采取紧急措施为市民赶制棉衣
    重庆党政领导人员深入调查研究，调整加工任务，挖掘缝纫潜力。
    新华社重庆18日电　重庆市党政领导机关采取紧急措施解决市民过冬棉衣的缝制和供应问题。
    目前已是严冬季节，但一般缝纫店都不接受来料，个别虽然接受来料，却要一个月到三个月才能取货。据商业部门估计，全市冬季棉衣供应大约还差十八万件，门市已经脱销，给市民过冬造成很大威胁。同时，缝纫店不讲究技术，短针、少线、裁错、缝错等粗制滥造现象十分严重，引起了市民不满。
    为了迅速解决这个问题，中共重庆市委员会书记、重庆市市长任白戈等党政领导人深入缝纫生产合作社作了调查，还邀请有二十年以上的缝纫经验的老师傅史永康、董浩然、厉童德等进行座谈。中共重庆市委员会召开了包括各区委书记、缝纫生产联社主任及有关干部参加的常委扩大会议，进一步作了认真的研究，确定了解决这个问题的原则。重庆市人民委员会第五办公室、商业和手工业管理部门也多次召开了会议，研究这个问题。
    据了解，缝纫店不接受棉衣来料的重要原因，是商业部门加工任务和缝纫生产合作社自产自销的数量过大。为了使缝纫社能腾出力量接受棉衣来料，目前商业部门已将加工任务缩减到只占全市缝纫生产能力的3.5％。手工业管理部门也已确定今后缝纫生产合作社以承接门市来料为主。在门市来料和加工较少的情况下，缝纫店可以进行一部分自产自销，以调剂生产的均衡。由于市民急需棉衣御寒，除鼓励缝纫店积极承接来料外，重庆市商业和手工业管理部门已着手统一组织力量，挖掘潜力，将一千多个有缝纫技术的职工家属和散居在街道的缝纫工人组织起来，于短期内赶制十万件棉衣供应市场。为了鼓励提高质量，改进技术，决定对现行工资制度逐步加以改革，并订出必要的质量的检查和考核制度。
