Xinhua News Agency, November 12th: According to a "Al-Ahram" correspondent in New York on November 10th, United Nations Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjöld told the British and French delegations to the United Nations that he could not accept the proposal of Britain and France to allow their "technicians" to clear obstacles in the Suez Canal.

Hammarskjöld explained that the United Nations General Assembly resolution stipulated that sailors engaged in this work should only be recruited from small countries. Hammarskjöld has already begun discussing the recruitment of salvage sailors with some smaller countries.

Britain and France made the request to be responsible for "clearing" the canal in their ceasefire notification to the United Nations on November 6th. They demanded that the "attached technicians" of the British and French invading Egyptian forces be used to clear the obstacles blocking the canal and the canal entrance, thereby creating a pretext for the British and French invading forces to continue occupying the canal zone.

According to a Reuters report on November 10th, the British and French troops did not actually expect a response from the United Nations, and they "had already been carrying out the work of clearing Port Said."

    哈马舍尔德根据联大决议
    拒绝由英法清除运河障碍物
    新华社12日讯　据“金字塔报”驻纽约记者10日报道，联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德告诉英国和法国驻联合国代表团说，他不能接受英法两国提出的让它们的“技术人员”在塞得港清理苏伊士运河障碍物的建议。
    哈马舍尔德解释联合国大会的决议说，应当只从小国招募从事这种工作的水手。哈马舍尔德已经开始就招募打捞水手问题同一些较小的国家商谈。
    英法两国是在11月6日给联合国的宣布停火的通知中提出让它们负责“清理”运河的要求的。它们要求用英法侵略埃及部队的“随军技术人员”来清理封锁了运河和运河入口处的障碍物，从而为英法侵略军继续占领运河区制造口实。
    据路透社10日报道，英法的军队其实并不期待联合国的答复，它们“早就在进行清理塞得港”的工作了。
