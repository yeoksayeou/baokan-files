    Jieyu County Supply and Marketing Cooperative Blindly Engages in Business
    Accumulating Large Quantities of Production Materials
    (Reported by our newspaper) The Jieyu County Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Shanxi Province has accumulated over 1 million yuan worth of production materials. The accumulated items include new-style farm tools such as seeders, disc harrows, cotton planters, double-furrow plows, and walking plows, as well as diesel engines, portable steam engines, water pumps, fertilizers, pesticides, and horse-drawn sprayers. Except for a small amount that can still be sold, most are difficult to sell. The reason for the accumulation is that the leading cadres of the Jieyu County Supply and Marketing Cooperative were overwhelmed by the high tide of agricultural cooperation and failed to formulate a plan for supplying production materials based on specific conditions.
    Due to the large accumulation of goods, it has affected the supply of goods during the peak season. (Zhang Zhong)

    解虞县供销社盲目经营
    积压大量生产资料
    本报讯　山西省解虞县供销合作社积压了价值一百多万元的生产资料。积压的品种有播种机、圆盘耙、棉花播种机、双铧犁、步犁等新式农具及柴油机、锅驼机、水泵、肥料、农药、马拉喷雾车等。其中除少量还可以推销外，大部分都很难推销了。造成积压的原因，是解虞县供销合作社的领导干部，被农业合作化的高潮冲昏了头脑，没有根据具体条件制定供应生产资料的计划。
    由于大量货物积压，已影响到旺季商品的供应工作。（张中）
