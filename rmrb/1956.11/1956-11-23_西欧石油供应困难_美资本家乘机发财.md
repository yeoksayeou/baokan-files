Xinhua News Agency, 21st. New York Dispatch: American capitalists are taking advantage of the Western European oil shortage to raise oil prices and shipping rates.

Gulf Oil Corporation recently raised the price of industrial oil along the Gulf Coast from $2.10 per barrel to $2.35, while some other companies have raised prices to $2.60 per barrel.

According to the "Journal of Commerce," three more shipping companies recently agreed to increase freight rates, with price increases ranging from 15 cents to 60 cents per dollar.

The blockage of the Suez Canal has given the American shipbuilding industry, which has been relatively depressed in recent years, an opportunity to make money. The "Journal of Commerce" said on the 19th that due to the "foresight" that the Suez Canal will not be navigable in the short term, the need for oil tankers has increased. American shipbuilding companies have received thirty-eight orders in the past two weeks to build new oil tankers ranging from 35,000 tons to 100,000 tons each.

    西欧石油供应困难
    美资本家乘机发财
    新华社21日讯　纽约消息：美国资本家利用西欧石油荒的时机提高石油价格和航运运费。
    墨西哥湾石油公司最近把沿湾各地的工业用的石油价格从每桶美元二元一角涨到二元三角五分，另外一些公司还把价格涨到每桶二元六角。
    据“商务日报”说，最近又有三个轮船公司商定提高运费，提高的价格从美元一角五分到六角不等。
    苏伊士运河的堵塞给了近年来一直相当萧条的美国造船业以赚钱的机会。19日的“商务日报”说，由于“预见”苏伊士运河在短期内无法通航，油船的需要增加了。美国的造船公司在过去两周内接到了三十八起要承造每只从三万五千吨到十万吨的新油船的订单。
