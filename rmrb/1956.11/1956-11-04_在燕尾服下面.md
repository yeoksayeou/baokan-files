　　Many dark and strange things of old China are already quite unfamiliar to today's younger generation, and it is not easy to explain them. For example, in the past, the gang leaders in Shanghai often sent their underlings to pick quarrels and start fights in a certain place in order to carry out robberies. When the fight broke out, the gang leader would appear, bringing another group of underlings, claiming that they were there to maintain order. With a command, the gangsters who started the fight were naturally their own people, and there was no problem. As a result, they joined forces and looted everything. The victims were treated as troublemakers who disturbed the peace and were beaten severely. Today's young people find such stories somewhat doubtful, because their real life is too far removed from these things.

　　But I think today's young people should still have this kind of knowledge. Although China is already a new China, there are still many old things in the world. Understanding many situations in old China can help us understand many events in today's world by analogy and suddenly see the light.

　　Recently, Britain has been playing despicable tricks everywhere, in Kowloon and on the Suez Canal. In Kowloon, it was clear that the British authorities were sheltering and condoning Kuomintang agents in launching riots and persecuting the Chinese people. However, later, under the pretext of "restoring order," peaceful residents, and even the victims of the riots, were arrested and searched.

　　On the Suez Canal, this insidious and despicable gangster trick is being played on an even larger scale. The role that Israel is now playing is that of an international petty gangster who has been bought and told to pick quarrels and start fights. After a round of fighting, the "old men" Britain and France have come out, claiming to "maintain peace in the Middle East," issuing ultimatums and dispatching troops, with the same goal of robbery, to seize the Suez Canal from Egypt. President Nasser said it well: "When Egypt is defending itself in its own territory against Israeli aggression, Britain and France are preparing to invade the victim of this aggression."

　　But now the victims are not as weak as some defenseless people in old China. President Nasser rejected the British and French ultimatums and issued a general mobilization order. The Arab countries unanimously supported him, and the sympathy of the whole world is on this side. Gangster behavior will eventually go bankrupt.

　　Although there are still these dirty old things in the world, the Soviet Union, China, and other people's democratic countries are already new countries. There are also many nationally independent countries that have long had combat experience in dealing with these international gangsters. People living a new life must not only defend the new life of their own country, but also eliminate all these dirty old things in the world. For more than a hundred years, the Chinese people have been familiar with the robber faces under the top hats and tailsuits of British colonialists. Let our younger generation also become familiar with them! It is useful for the present, for the future, for friends, and for ourselves.

    在燕尾服下面
    舒芜
    旧中国的许多黑暗、古怪的事情，今天的青年一代已经很是隔膜，告诉他们，也不容易讲清楚。例如，过去上海滩上的流氓头子，为了要进行抢劫，常常事先派他的手下人到那里去寻衅，打起架来，这时他出现了，带来另一批手下人，说是这里的治安要由他们来维持，一声令下，原来寻衅打架的流氓当然是自家人，没有什么问题，结果是汇合一起，抢劫一通，事主倒被当作扰乱治安的祸首，挨了痛打。这样的故事，今天青年们听起来，便有些将信将疑，因为他们的现实生活实在同这些事情距离太远了。
    但我以为，今天的青年还是应该具备这类知识的。中国虽已是新中国，世界上却还有不少旧东西。懂得旧中国的许多情形，对今天世界上的许多事件也可以触类旁通，恍然大悟。
    最近这个时期的英国，便在九龙，在苏伊士运河上，到处扮演着卑劣的把戏。在九龙，明明是英国当局包庇和纵容国民党特务发动暴乱，残害中国人民，可是后来，在“恢复秩序”的名义下被逮捕、被搜查的，竟也有和平居民，甚至就是暴乱中的受害者。
    在苏伊士运河上，这种阴险卑劣的流氓把戏得到更大规模的扮演。以色列现在所担任的角色，就是被买嘱了先去寻衅打架的一个国际小流氓，打了一通，现在“老头子”英国和法国出来了，居然声称要“维护中东和平”，下最后通牒，调兵遣将，目的一样是抢劫，要把苏伊士运河从埃及手里抢去，纳赛尔总统说得好：“当埃及正在自己的领土内保卫自己抵抗以色列的侵略的时候，英国和法国却准备着对这种进攻的受害者进行侵略。”
    但现在的事主，不像旧中国某些无力自卫的人那样软弱了。纳赛尔总统拒绝了英、法的最后通牒，颁布了总动员令，阿拉伯国家一致支持，全世界的同情都在这一面。流氓行为最后总是要破产的。
    世界上虽然还有这些肮脏的旧东西，苏联、中国以及其他人民民主国家，却已经是新的国家。还有许多民族独立国家，一向有着对付这些国际流氓的战斗经验。过着新生活的人民，不但要保卫自己国家的新生活，也要在全世界消灭这一切肮脏的旧东西。中国人民百多年来早已熟识了英国殖民主义者的大礼帽和燕尾服下的强盗嘴脸，让我们的青年一代也熟识熟识吧！为现在，为将来，为朋友，为自己，都是有用的。
