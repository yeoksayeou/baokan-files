    Xinhua News Agency, November 9th—New York Dispatch: The Egyptian representative to the United Nations, Loutfi, held a lengthy meeting with UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld on the morning of November 8th. Loutfi demanded the immediate implementation of the United Nations General Assembly's resolution passed on November 7th, which orders the immediate withdrawal of British and French forces from Egypt, and the resolution on organizing the United Nations International Emergency Force.
    According to a report by a "Al-Ahram" reporter, after the meeting, Hammarskjöld formally sent the full text of these two resolutions to Britain, France, Israel, and Egypt. Hammarskjöld also assured Loutfi that he was working to ensure the implementation of these two resolutions.

    Xinhua News Agency, November 9th—Beirut Dispatch: According to a broadcast from Cairo Radio, an Egyptian official spokesperson announced: Egypt will not allow any technicians from the countries that attacked it to engage in the work of clearing obstacles in the Suez Canal.
    The spokesperson's statement was a response to Britain and France. In their ceasefire notice to the United Nations on November 6th, Britain and France requested that "technical personnel accompanying British and French troops" be allowed to "clear canal obstacles," attempting to use this as a pretext to keep their troops stationed in the canal area.
    The Egyptian spokesperson repeatedly stated that Egypt firmly insists that it agreed to a ceasefire on the condition that all foreign troops must withdraw from Egypt as soon as possible.

    新华社9日讯　纽约消息：埃及驻联合国代表卢特菲11月8日早晨同联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德进行了长时间的会谈，卢特菲要求立即履行联合国大会11月7日会议通过的关于责成英法部队立即退出埃及的决议和关于组织联合国国际紧急部队的决议。
    据“金字塔报”记者报道，在会谈后，哈马舍尔德把这两个决议的全文正式发给英、法、以色列和埃及。哈马舍尔德并且向卢特菲保证，他正在设法使这两个决议得到执行。
    新华社9日讯　贝鲁特消息：据开罗电台广播，埃及官方发言人宣布：埃及将不允许对它进行攻击的国家的任何技术人员来从事清除苏伊士运河中的障碍的工作。
    这位发言人的声明是对英法的一个答复。英法两国11月6日在致联合国的停火通知中要求让“英法军队的随军技术人员”来“清除运河障碍物”，企图借此把他们的军队继续驻在运河区域。
    这位埃及发言人反复说明，埃及坚决表示它是在一切外国军队必须尽快撤出埃及的条件下同意停火的。
