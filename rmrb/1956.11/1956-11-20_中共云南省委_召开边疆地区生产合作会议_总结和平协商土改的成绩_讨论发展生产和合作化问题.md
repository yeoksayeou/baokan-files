　　Kunming, November 18th (By our newspaper) – The Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a border area production cooperation conference from the 6th to the 17th. Attending the meeting were 109 leading cadres and grassroots cadres from the CPC committees of prefectures, counties, and districts of the Dehong Dai-Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture, Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture, Honghe Hani Autonomous Region, Nujiang Lisu Autonomous Region, Lancang Lahu Autonomous Region, and Lincang and Simao special districts. In addition to summarizing the achievements made in completing peaceful consultation on land reform in border areas with a population of 1.42 million, the conference focused on discussing how to further develop production in border areas in a comprehensive manner in the future. Currently, due to the implementation of peaceful consultation on land reform and the trial establishment of nearly a thousand agricultural cooperatives in border areas, significant changes have taken place in class relations, ethnic relations, and political, economic, and cultural aspects in these regions. At present, the urgent demand of the people of all ethnic groups in the border areas is to further develop production, gradually change the backwardness of all ethnic groups, and gradually improve the material and cultural lives of the people. However, due to the backward conditions historically left behind and the low level of social productivity, the realization of socialist agricultural cooperation in these areas must be carried out according to the different characteristics of each ethnic group. It is necessary to take into account the awareness, economic characteristics, and customs of each ethnic group; and also to consider that there is no mature experience in developing cooperativization in the border areas. Therefore, all specific policies and practices must emphasize starting from the actual conditions of the local ethnic groups, and oppose the subjective work style of mechanically copying inland experiences divorced from specific conditions. The speed of agricultural cooperativization should not be too fast, and it must be carried out cautiously and steadily, starting with pilot projects to gain experience before developing in batches. The number of developments in the first year should be controlled within 5%.

　　Based on the experience of nearly a thousand agricultural cooperatives on trial implementation, the development of production in border areas should not only develop agriculture, but also develop sideline occupations and handicrafts; not only develop food crops, but also develop cash crops. In the process of developing production, the state should not only help agricultural cooperatives, but also help individual households with difficulties. While fully discussing the development of production, the conference also made a deep examination of the work style of cadres in border areas. The conference believes that in the past few years, Han cadres from outside and local ethnic minority cadres have worked together and done a lot of work in the border areas. Without their connection with the masses, the work in the border areas would not have achieved today's results. In the future, it is still necessary to give full play to the spirit of active creation and maintain the fine work style of being realistic, seeking truth from facts, and sharing weal and woe with the people of all ethnic groups in the border areas wholeheartedly. Han cadres should consult with ethnic minority cadres on everything and respect the opinions of ethnic minority cadres. If ethnic minority cadres do not agree with something, they should wait patiently and oppose the subjective and dogmatic tendencies of self-righteousness and great Han chauvinism. In terms of foreign relations in the border areas, the conference believes that it is necessary to follow the call of the Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and be vigilant and prevent great power chauvinistic tendencies.

    中共云南省委
    召开边疆地区生产合作会议
    总结和平协商土改的成绩　讨论发展生产和合作化问题
    本报昆明18日电　中共云南省委于6—17日召开了边疆地区生产合作会议，到会的有德宏傣族景颇族自治州、西双版纳傣族自治州、红河哈尼族自治区、怒江傈僳族自治区、澜沧拉祜族自治区及临沧、思茅等专区的地、县、区委的领导干部和基层干部一百零九人。此次会议除了总结出在边疆一百四十二万人口的地区，完成了和平协商土地改革所取得的成绩以外，还着重讨论了今后在边疆地区如何进一步全面发展生产的问题。目前边疆地区，由于实现了和平协商土改及试办了近千个农业社，边疆地区的阶级关系、民族关系以及政治、经济、文化等方面都起了很大的变化。当前边疆各族人民迫切的要求是进一步发展生产，逐步改变各民族的落后面貌和逐渐改善人民物质文化生活。但因历史上遗留下来的落后状况，社会生产力很低，在这些地区实现社会主义农业合作化必须根据各族人民不同的特点来进行，既要照顾到各族人民的觉悟、经济特点、风俗习惯；又要考虑到在边疆地区发展合作化还没有一套成熟的经验，因此一切具体政策和做法，须特别强调从当地各族人民中的实际情况出发，反对脱离具体条件的硬搬内地经验的主观主义作风。农业合作化的速度不宜太快，须在慎重稳步的原则下，从试点开始取得经验后，再成批的发展。第一年发展数字应控制在5％以内。
    根据试办的近千个农业社的经验，边疆地区发展生产，不仅要发展农业，还要发展副业和手工业；不但要发展粮食作物，还要发展经济作物。国家在发展生产中，不但要帮助农业社，还要帮助有困难的单干户。会上在全面讨论发展生产的同时，关于边疆地区的干部作风，也作了深刻的检查。大会认为几年来外来的汉族干部和当地民族干部一起，在边疆地区作了很多工作，没有他们联系群众，边疆地区的工作不会有今天的成绩。今后，仍须发挥积极的创造精神和保持实事求是全心全意同边疆各族人民同甘共苦的优良作风。汉族干部遇事要同民族干部商量，尊重民族干部的意见，民族干部不同意办的事情，就要耐心等待，反对自以为是的主观主义和强加于人的大民族主义倾向。在边疆地区对外关系方面，会议认为必须遵循中央和毛主席的号召，警惕和防止大国主义倾向。
