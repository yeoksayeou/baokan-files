Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, November 21st: The Buddha Tooth Relic, escorted by the Buddha Tooth Relic Protection Delegation of the Buddhist Association of China after being brought back from Burma, left the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture on the 20th and returned to Kunming. On the morning of the 20th, a grand farewell ceremony was held next to the Manting Temple near Jinghong, the capital of the autonomous prefecture. More than three thousand bhikkhus and Buddhist believers, after worshipping the Buddha Tooth Relic for the last time, held religious ceremonies such as chanting scriptures and paying homage to the Dharma masters. Many people set up incense tables, set off "high risers" (fireworks), beat elephant foot drums, and blew conch shells by the temple to bid farewell to the Buddha Tooth Relic. The governor and deputy governor of the autonomous prefecture, along with a group of bhikkhus and lay Buddhists, walked more than four kilometers, accompanying the Buddha Tooth Relic all the way to the Lancang River.

In the past twenty-six days, the Buddha Tooth Relic was enshrined in the Manting Temple near Jinghong. Although it is currently the busiest winter harvest season in Xishuangbanna, hundreds and thousands of people from all over the autonomous prefecture came to worship the Buddha Tooth Relic every day. More than 24,000 people from the autonomous prefecture and nearby areas came to pay their respects to the Buddha Tooth Relic.

Since being brought back from Burma in June this year, the Buddha Tooth Relic has been enshrined in Kunming and the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture, Shuangjiang County, Lijiang County, and Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture in the Yunnan border region, where it has been admired and worshipped by more than 400,000 people of the Dai, Tibetan, Naxi, and other ethnic groups who believe in Buddhism.

    佛牙返回昆明
    据新华社昆明21日电　从缅甸迎奉回国的佛牙在中国佛教协会佛牙护侍团的护送下，20日离开西双版纳傣族自治州，返回昆明。20日上午，在自治州首府允景洪附近的曼听佛寺旁边，举行了隆重的欢送仪式，三千多个比丘和佛教信徒在最后一次朝拜佛牙后，举行了诵经、参拜法师等宗教仪式，许多人在寺边摆香案、放高升（焰火）、敲起象脚鼓、吹着法螺，向佛牙告别。自治州的州长，副州长和一群比丘、居士走了四华里多路程，将佛牙一直送到澜沧江边。
    过去二十六天内，佛牙被供奉在允景洪附近的曼听佛寺里，尽管目前正是西双版纳一年中最繁忙的冬收季节，但每天都有成百上千的人从自治州各地赶来参拜佛牙。自治州和附近地区共有两万四千多人前来瞻拜了佛牙。
    佛牙自今年6月从缅甸迎接回国后，半年来先后被供奉在昆明和云南边疆上的德宏傣族景颇族自治州和双江县、丽江县、西双版纳傣族自治州，受到信奉佛教的傣、藏、纳西等族四十多万人的瞻仰和朝拜。
