Xinhua News Agency, November 4th: A Moscow-to-Beijing international train, after eight days and nights of travel, is completing its final journey this afternoon. As always, the Soviet people have sent us many outstanding experts on this train to help with our construction. With a feeling of gratitude, the reporter boarded the train from Tianjin to interview these guests from afar who are helping with our country's construction.

The gray-haired telecommunications expert Shamokhov, from Leningrad, is already 56 years old. A group of Chinese students he trained in the Soviet Union have already returned to China and taken up their posts. Now, he has come to China himself to help with our country's construction. This enthusiastic old man said that when he left Leningrad, many Chinese students went to the station to see him off, and relatives and friends repeatedly told him to contribute all his skills and experience to the Chinese people. He said that this is a matter of course, because China's construction is also our cause.

Among these Soviet friends, many are coming to China for the second time to help with construction, and they all feel immensely honored to be able to contribute to China's socialist construction. In the carriage, the reporter interviewed Legekin, a water conservancy expert from Moscow. This is his second time helping our country with the Yellow River exploration plan. He visited many places along the Yellow River during his first trip to China. This time, he brought a large amount of technical data and charts. Legekin told the reporter that he will contribute his more than 30 years of work experience to China's construction, and work with the Chinese people to harness the Yellow River, so that the power of the Yellow River can serve the great Chinese people. At 4:10 p.m., the international train slowly entered Beijing Railway Station to the tune of "Moscow-Beijing." People went to the carriage doors to welcome these Soviet experts with bright bouquets and warm greetings. Many Soviet experts in Beijing also came to the station to greet them.

    苏联人民又派来一批优秀专家
    新华社4日讯　一趟从莫斯科到北京的国际列车，在行驶了八昼夜以后，今天下午正在完成它最后的行程。在这趟列车上，和每次一样，苏联人民给我们派来了许多优秀的专家。记者怀着感激的心情，从天津登上列车，访问这些帮助我国建设的远方来客。
    来自列宁格勒的白发苍苍的电讯专家沙莫赫瓦洛夫，已经五十六岁了。他在苏联培养的中国留学生，已经有一批回国走上了工作岗位。现在，他又亲自到中国来帮助我国建设。这位热情的老人说，他在离开列宁格勒的时候，许多中国留学生都到车站上送行，亲戚朋友们一再嘱咐要他把自己的技术和经验全部贡献给中国人民。他说，这是当然的事情，因为中国的建设事业也是我们的事业。
    在这些苏联朋友当中，有不少是第二次来中国帮助建设的，他们对自己能够在中国的社会主义建设中贡献一份力量，都感到无上的光荣。在车厢里，记者访问了一位从莫斯科来的水利专家列基金，他是第二次来帮助我国从事黄河勘探计划工作的。他在第一次来中国的时候，曾经到过黄河沿岸的许多地方。这次他带来了大批技术资料和图表。列基金向记者说，他将把自己三十多年的工作经验贡献给中国建设事业，和中国人民一道澄清黄河，让黄河的力量为伟大的中国人民服务。下午四时十分，这列国际列车在“莫斯科—北京”歌曲声中慢慢地开进了北京车站。人们都走到车厢门口用鲜艳的花束和热情的问候来欢迎这些苏联专家。在北京的许多苏联专家也到车站来迎接他们。
