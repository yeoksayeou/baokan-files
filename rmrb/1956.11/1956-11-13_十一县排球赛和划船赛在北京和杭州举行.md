Xinhua News Agency, November 11th – The 1956 Eleven-County Volleyball Tournament opened in Beijing today. This is the first national volleyball competition for counties held in China.

Participating in this competition are twenty men's and women's volleyball teams from eleven units, including Taishan County and Wenchang County in Guangdong Province, Jinjiang County, Fuqing County, Longyan County, and Longxi County in Fujian Province, and Yanji County, Hunchun County, Helong County, Antu County, and Wangqing County in the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture of Jilin Province. There are a total of 252 male and female athletes, most of whom are farmers, students, and government employees.

This competition adopts a single round-robin system, so each team has the opportunity to meet other teams. Nine games were played today, and the entire competition is expected to end on the 23rd.

Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, November 11th – The 1956 Rowing Exhibition Tournament opened on West Lake in Hangzhou this morning.

Participating in this rowing exhibition tournament are more than eighty male and female athletes from four cities, including Shanghai, Harbin, Lushun-Dalian, and Hangzhou. Among them are excellent worker-athletes from the Songhua River, university and middle school students, and boat workers from West Lake. They all underwent active training before the competition.

This exhibition tournament includes eight events such as single sculls, doubles, fours, and eights. The competition will be conducted using racing shells in accordance with international rowing competition regulations. The characteristics of this type of racing shell are that it is narrow and light, and the seat is movable, resulting in a very fast stroke. It has not been used in our country before. The racing shells used in this exhibition tournament were recently specially manufactured for water sports athletes by the Shanghai Inland River Shipyard.

After the opening ceremony of the exhibition tournament, due to a cold wave arriving today and strong winds on the lake surface, only one event was performed unofficially. The others will be held successively on the 12th.

    十一县排球赛和划船赛在北京和杭州举行
    据新华社11日讯　1956年十一县排球锦标赛今天在北京开幕。这是中国第一次举办的全国性的县的排球比赛。
    参加这次比赛的有广东省台山县、文昌县和福建省的晋江县、福清县、龙岩县、龙溪县以及吉林省延边朝鲜自治州的延吉县、珲春县、和龙县、安图县、汪清县等十一个单位的二十个男女排球队，共有男女运动员二百五十二名，其中大部分是农民、学生和机关干部。
    这次比赛采用单循环制，因此每队都有机会和其它各队相遇。今天进行了九场比赛，全部比赛预计在23日结束。
    新华社杭州11日电　1956年划船表演赛今晨在杭州西湖开幕。
    参加这次划船表演赛的有上海、哈尔滨、旅大、杭州等四个城市的八十多名男女运动员，这里有松花江上优秀的工人运动员，有大中学生和西子湖上的游船工人。他们在比赛前都进行了积极的锻练。
    这次表演赛中有单人双桨，双人、四人、八人单桨等八个比赛项目。比赛都将按照国际划船比赛的规定，用赛艇来进行。这种赛艇的特点是狭长而轻，坐凳是活动的划速很快，过去在我国还未用过。这次表演赛所用的赛艇是上海内河造船厂最近特地为水上运动员们制造的。
    表演赛宣布开幕后，因今天寒潮来袭，湖面有大风，结果，只非正式表演了一个项目，其他将在12日陆续进行。
