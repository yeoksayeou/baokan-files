Comrades:

    First of all, please allow me to extend warm congratulations on behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to the National Congress of Active Builders of Socialism of Families of Martyrs, Families of Military Personnel, Disabled Servicemen, and Demobilized Servicemen, and through the congress, to express our highest respect and heartfelt greetings to the comrades of the Families of Martyrs, Families of Military Personnel, Disabled Servicemen, and Demobilized Servicemen throughout the country.

    Comrades of the Families of Martyrs, Families of Military Personnel, Disabled Servicemen, and Demobilized Servicemen! Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the People's Government, you, together with the people of the whole country, contributed tremendous strength to the great liberation struggle of the Chinese people. The result of this struggle ended the rule of feudalism, imperialism, and bureaucrat-capitalism in China, and thoroughly completed the bourgeois democratic revolution. As you know, the bourgeois democratic revolution only paved the way for the socialist revolution. Only by building a socialist society can we completely eliminate exploitation and poverty and improve the material and cultural living standards of the people. With the bravery and wisdom of participating in the revolutionary war, you have continued to participate in the glorious socialist construction. Tens of thousands of Families of Martyrs, Families of Military Personnel, Disabled Servicemen, and Demobilized Servicemen have made many achievements on the production front and other work posts. Many of them have been selected as production models, work models, study models, and advanced workers, and some have even been selected as representatives to people's congresses at all levels or appointed as staff members of state organs and state-owned enterprises and institutions. You have proved with your labor and work achievements that you are an indispensable force in the cause of socialist construction.

    Comrades! There are hundreds of thousands of active builders of socialism among the Families of Martyrs, Families of Military Personnel, Disabled Servicemen, and Demobilized Servicemen throughout the country, and you are their representatives. Many of you comrades have spoken about your exemplary deeds at this conference. Your exemplary deeds are examples that the Families of Martyrs, Families of Military Personnel, Disabled Servicemen, and Demobilized Servicemen throughout the country should learn from, and also examples that the people of the whole country should learn from. You were originally glorious, and the people have always respected you. Now, you have set good examples and achieved new successes. Therefore, you have gained even greater glory and won greater respect from the people.

    "Carry forward the revolutionary tradition and strive for greater glory" is the call of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao to all Families of Martyrs, Families of Military Personnel, Disabled Servicemen, and Demobilized Servicemen. All Families of Martyrs, Families of Military Personnel, Disabled Servicemen, and Demobilized Servicemen throughout the country should work diligently and conscientiously, and dedicate all their strength and wisdom in their production or work posts. China's socialist construction cause must be created by 600 million people in various positions through hard work. Whether it is physical labor or mental labor, whether it is doing revolutionary work in that aspect, it is glorious and indispensable to the great socialist construction cause. Strictly abiding by one's post, being content with one's work, and fighting to the end for the people's revolutionary cause is our revolutionary tradition. The vast majority of the Families of Martyrs, Families of Military Personnel, Disabled Servicemen, and Demobilized Servicemen have inherited and carried forward such revolutionary traditions, but they must further carry forward such revolutionary traditions, especially the demobilized servicemen comrades must further carry forward such revolutionary traditions.

    Comrades! According to the instructions of the Eighth National Congress of the Party, to build our country into a prosperous and happy socialist society without exploitation and poverty, and to build a socialist industrial country with a basically complete industrial system, there is still a considerable distance to go, and we still have to do many arduous tasks that our ancestors have never done. The great people's liberation struggle shattered the shackles that had been pressing on us for many years; the socialist construction that is underway will create a happy and beautiful life for us and our descendants. Our future is bright and brilliant, but the work before us is still very arduous, which requires greater efforts.

    Comrades! For the benefit of the socialist cause, for the benefit of the broad masses of the people, and to maintain your glory forever, the Party and the government call on you to be modest and prudent, and guard against arrogance and impetuosity. Chairman Mao taught us: "Modesty helps one to progress, while arrogance makes one lag behind." We should always remember this truth.

    The Party and the government also call on you to study diligently, research humbly, master new science and technology, give full play to your initiative and creativity, and overcome all possible difficulties in the cause of socialist construction.

    The Party and the government also call on you to play a backbone and leading role among the Families of Martyrs, Families of Military Personnel, Disabled Servicemen, Demobilized Servicemen and the broad masses of the people, and humbly learn from the masses, mingle with the people, and mingle with local cadres.

    The Party and the government also call on you to use your high political consciousness and labor enthusiasm, and use your practical achievements in production and work, to encourage the relatives and comrades in the front to bravely and faithfully defend the border, coast, and airspace of the motherland, build a modern national defense army, and defend our great socialist construction. Demobilized servicemen comrades, must be vigilant at all times against the sabotage conspiracies of imperialism and the remaining counter-revolutionary forces, and be ready to respond to the call of the motherland when needed.

    Of course, the Party and the government should further improve the work of preferential treatment and demobilization placement, should deeply understand the actual situation of the Families of Martyrs, Families of Military Personnel, Disabled Servicemen, and Demobilized Servicemen throughout the country in life, production, and work, and earnestly solve your problems and difficulties, and should care about your pain and itching.

    If it is wrong and not allowed in our country for the Party and the government not to care about the lives of the masses; then it is even more wrong and not allowed not to care about the lives of the Families of Martyrs, Families of Military Personnel, Disabled Servicemen, and Demobilized Servicemen, and not to help them solve the difficulties that should be solved and can be solved. For the solution of the problems of the Families of Martyrs, Families of Military Personnel, Disabled Servicemen who lack labor, and the Demobilized Servicemen who have difficulties in life, we have always adopted a method of combining government support with mass assistance. Facts have proved that this method is necessary and correct. In rural areas, the method of preferential treatment of labor days by agricultural production cooperatives should be earnestly implemented; the government must also provide necessary subsidies. There are 30 million Families of Martyrs, Families of Military Personnel, Disabled Servicemen, and Demobilized Servicemen in the country. The government and the people must show a high degree of service spirit and a serious and responsible attitude towards these 30 million people. Therefore, strengthening the work of preferential treatment and demobilization placement in governments at all levels, and strengthening the education of supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of revolutionary armymen among the masses of the people, still need to be emphasized.

    Comrades! The Party and the government have always attached great importance to the work of preferential treatment and demobilization placement. They have given great support to these works in terms of finance and other aspects; the civil affairs departments and the transferred construction committees and other relevant departments have generally worked hard on these works, achieved many results, and accumulated some experience. This should be affirmed. However, it should be pointed out that the Party and government leaders in some places do not pay enough attention to these works, and the civil affairs departments still have many shortcomings in these works, and some relevant departments do not support these works enough. Some cadres only verbally acknowledge that the Families of Martyrs, Families of Military Personnel, Disabled Servicemen, and Demobilized Servicemen are an active force in socialist construction, but in practice, they do not pay enough attention to how to make these people fully play an active role in production and work. The method of preferential treatment of labor days for the Families of Martyrs, Families of Military Personnel, and Disabled Servicemen who lack labor has not been well implemented in some places until today, so that their lives cannot be guaranteed to reach the due level; for the placement of demobilized servicemen, there are still a few people who have not been properly placed or have not been placed. All these shortcomings should be immediately checked and corrected. It should be stated that the problems of preferential treatment and demobilization placement cannot be completely solved by a government department. All relevant departments of the Party and the government must attach importance to and support them in order to achieve a satisfactory solution. Therefore, the Party committees and governments in all places must further attach importance to these works and must earnestly do these works better. At the same time, we also hope that all Families of Martyrs, Families of Military Personnel, Disabled Servicemen, and Demobilized Servicemen, especially the active elements among them, will all come to help and supervise the government to do a good job in the work of preferential treatment and demobilization placement.

    I believe that the Families of Martyrs, Families of Military Personnel, Disabled Servicemen, and Demobilized Servicemen throughout the country will surely respond to the call of the Party and Chairman Mao, contribute more strength to the great cause of socialist construction, and strive for greater glory. In fact, the vast majority of our comrades have done just that. However, we cannot fail to see that there are also a few people who have not been able to do this. They regard the honor given by the people as a burden on their backs, they are complacent and arrogant, and no longer continue to work hard. They do not exert the power they can exert in production and work, enjoy the treatment they should enjoy, but demand that the government and the people meet their excessive and unreasonable demands; individual demobilized servicemen are overly picky about work and are not content with their posts; and some demobilized servicemen are unwilling to live in rural areas and are unwilling to engage in agricultural labor. These are obviously not in line with the spirit of "carrying forward the revolutionary tradition and striving for greater glory," and are not in line with the spirit of hard struggle and building socialism. Although this is an extremely individual phenomenon, it should not come from our glorious ranks. We hope that the comrades present at the meeting will assist the government in educating these comrades, helping them overcome their shortcomings, and leading them forward together. We hope that all Families of Martyrs, Families of Military Personnel, Disabled Servicemen, and Demobilized Servicemen in the country will be able to "carry forward the revolutionary tradition and strive for greater glory," and make greater contributions to the cause of building our country into a great socialist industrial country.

    在全国烈属、军属、残废军人、复员军人社会主义建设积极分子大会上
    中共中央政治局委员董必武的讲话
    同志们：
    首先让我代表中国共产党中央委员会向烈士家属、军人家属、残废军人、复员军人社会主义建设积极分子大会致以热烈的祝贺，并通过大会向全国的烈士家属、军人家属、残废军人、复员军人同志们表示崇高的敬意和亲切的慰问。
    烈士家属、军人家属、残废军人、复员军人同志们！你们在中国共产党和人民政府的领导下，同全国人民在一起，在中国人民伟大的解放斗争中，贡献过巨大的力量。这一斗争的结果，结束了封建主义、帝国主义、官僚资本主义在中国的统治，彻底地完成了资产阶级性的民主革命。你们知道，资产阶级性的民主革命，只是为社会主义革命开辟了道路，只有建成社会主义社会，才能彻底消灭剥削和贫困，提高人民的物质生活和文化生活水平。你们以参加革命战争的勇敢和智慧，继续参加了光荣的社会主义建设。成千成万的烈士家属、军人家属、残废军人、复员军人在生产战线上和其他工作岗位上，都作出了许多成绩，其中不少的人被选为生产模范、工作模范、学习模范和先进工作者，有些人还被选为各级人民代表大会的代表，或者被委任为国家机关、国营企业事业单位的工作人员。你们用自己的劳动和工作的成就，证明了你们是社会主义建设事业中一支不可缺少的力量。
    同志们！全国烈士家属、军人家属、残废军人、复员军人中有几十万社会主义建设积极分子，你们就是他们的代表。你们中有不少同志在这个大会上讲了自己的模范事迹。你们的模范事迹，是全国烈士家属、军人家属、残废军人、复员军人应该学习的榜样，也是全国人民应该学习的榜样。你们本来是光荣的，人民过去就很尊重你们；现在，你们做出了好的榜样，拿出了新的成绩，因此，你们就取得了更大的光荣，博得了人民更大的尊重。
    “发扬革命传统，争取更大光荣”，这是共产党和毛主席对全体烈士家属、军人家属、残废军人、复员军人的号召。全国的烈士家属、军人家属、残废军人、复员军人同志们都应当勤勤恳恳地劳动，兢兢业业地工作，在自己的生产或者工作岗位上，献出自己所有的力量和智慧。中国的社会主义建设事业，要由六亿人民在各个不同的岗位上，用辛勤的劳动来创造。不论是体力劳动、脑力劳动，不论是在那个方面做革命工作，都是光荣的，都是伟大的社会主义建设事业所不可缺少的。严守自己的岗位，安心于自己的工作，为人民的革命事业奋斗到底，这是我们的革命传统。烈士家属、军人家属、残废军人、复员军人同志们绝大多数都是继承和发扬了这样的革命传统，但是还要进一步发扬这样的革命传统，特别是复员军人同志们更要进一步发扬这样的革命传统。
    同志们！按照党的第八次全国代表大会的指示，要把我国建设成一个没有剥削和贫困的、繁荣幸福的社会主义社会，建设成一个基本上完整的工业体系的社会主义工业国，还有一段相当远的路程，还要做许多艰巨的、我们祖先从未做过的工作。伟大的人民解放斗争，粉碎了多少年来压在我们身上的枷锁；正在进行的社会主义建设，将为我们以及我们的子孙创造幸福美好的生活。我们的前途是光辉灿烂的，可是我们面前的工作，还是十分艰巨的，这需要作更大的努力。
    同志们！为了社会主义事业的利益，为了广大人民的利益，为了永远保持你们的光荣，党和政府号召你们谦虚谨慎，戒骄戒躁。毛主席教导说：“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后”，我们应当永远记住这个真理。
    党和政府还号召你们，在社会主义建设事业中，应当刻苦学习，虚心研究，掌握新的科学技术，发挥积极性和创造性，克服一切可能遇到的困难。
    党和政府还号召你们，在全国烈士家属、军人家属、残废军人、复员军人和广大人民群众中起骨干作用和带头作用，并且虚心地向群众学习，和人民打成一片，和当地的干部打成一片。
    党和政府还号召你们，用自己高度的政治觉悟和劳动热情，用自己在生产和工作上的实际成绩，来勉励前方的亲人和战友勇敢地、忠实地保卫祖国的边防、海防和领空，建设现代化的国防军，保卫我们伟大的社会主义建设。复员军人同志们，要时刻警惕帝国主义和反革命残余势力的破坏阴谋，时刻准备着在一旦需要的时候响应祖国的召唤。
    当然，党和政府应该进一步地做好优抚和复员安置工作，应当深入地了解全国烈士家属、军人家属、残废军人、复员军人在生活上、生产和工作上的实际情况，切实解决你们的问题和困难，应当关心你们的痛痒。
    如果说，在我们的国家里，党和政府不关心群众生活是错误的，是不允许的；那末，不关心烈士家属、军人家属、残废军人、复员军人的生活，不帮助他们解决应该解决而可能解决的困难，则更是错误的，更是不允许的。对于缺乏劳动力的烈士家属、军人家属、残废军人以及生活上有困难的复员军人的问题的解决，我们一向是采取政府支持与群众帮助相结合的办法，事实证明，这种办法是必要的、正确的。在农村中，由农业生产合作社对他们优待劳动日的办法应该认真执行；政府也必须予以必要的补助。全国烈士家属、军人家属、残废军人、复员军人有三千万，对待这三千万人，政府和人民必须拿出高度的服务精神和认真的负责态度。因此，在各级政府中加强优抚和复员安置工作，在人民群众中加强拥军优属的教育，现在仍然有继续加以强调的必要。
    同志们！党和政府对于优抚和复员安置工作一向是十分重视的。在财政方面和其他方面给这些工作以很大的支持；民政部门和转业建设委员会以及其他有关部门在这些工作上，一般地都很努力，取得了不少成绩，也积累了一些经验。这是应该肯定的。但是，应该指出，还有些地方的党政领导对于这些工作重视不够，民政部门在这些工作上还存在许多缺点，某些有关部门对这些工作支持得不够。有的干部只是口头上承认烈士家属、军人家属、残废军人、复员军人是社会主义建设的积极力量，但是在实际上对于如何使这些人在生产上和工作上充分发挥积极作用，却注意得不够。对于缺乏劳动力的烈士家属、军人家属，残废军人优待劳动日的办法，直到今天还有一些地方没有很好地加以贯彻，以致他们的生活还不能有保证地达到应有的水平；对于复员军人的安置工作，还有少数人安置得不妥当或者还没有安置。所有这些缺点，都是应该立即加以检查和纠正的。应该说明：优抚和复员安置工作问题，不是政府某一部门所能完全解决的，必须全党和政府的各个有关部门都加以重视和支持，才能得到圆满的解决。因此，各地的党委和政府必须进一步重视这些工作，必须切实地把这些工作做得更好。同时，我们也希望全体烈士家属、军人家属、残废军人、复员军人，首先是其中的积极分子，大家都来帮助和监督政府做好优抚和复员安置工作。
    我相信，全国的烈士家属、军人家属、残废军人、复员军人一定能够响应党和毛主席的号召，在伟大的社会主义建设事业中贡献出更多的力量，争取更大的光荣。事实上，我们绝大多数的同志正是这样做了的。但是，我们也不能不看到，也有少数的人还没有能够做到这样。他们把人民给予的荣誉当作包袱背起来，他们居功自傲、盛气凌人、不再继续艰苦奋斗了，他们在生产中和工作中不是尽自己所能尽的力量，享受自己应该享受的待遇，而是要求政府和人民满足他们过高的、不合理的要求；有个别的复员军人，过分地挑剔工作，不安心自己的岗位；也有的复员军人不愿意过农村生活，不愿意从事农业劳动。这些，显然是和“发扬革命传统，争取更大光荣”的精神不相符合的，同艰苦奋斗、建设社会主义的精神不相符合的。这虽然是极个别的现象，但出自我们光荣的行列是不应该的。我们希望到会的同志协助政府对这些同志进行教育，帮助他们克服缺点，带领他们一起前进。我们希望全国烈士家属、军人家属、残废军人和复员军人，人人都能做到“发扬革命传统，争取更大光荣”，在把我国建设成为伟大的社会主义工业国的事业中，做出更大的贡献。
