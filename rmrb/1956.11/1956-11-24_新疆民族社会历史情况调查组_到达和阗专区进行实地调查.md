    Xinjiang National Social History Investigation Group
    Arrives in Hotan Prefecture for Field Investigation
    (Our newspaper dispatch) The Xinjiang National Social History Investigation Group has arrived in Hotan and will conduct a three-month field investigation in Hotan Prefecture. This investigation group was formed in early September. Its main task is to investigate and study the social nature of various ethnic groups in Xinjiang before liberation, as well as the history of each ethnic group over the past century, combined with investigations and research on ancient history, ethnic relations, and archaeology. The investigation group consists of 30 people, including professors, researchers, cadres, and university graduates from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Central Institute for Nationalities, relevant units in the autonomous region. The investigation will last for four to seven years. Before their departure, they underwent training and held discussions with relevant individuals. The various ethnic groups in Xinjiang had different social and historical development characteristics before liberation. Investigating and studying the social and economic structure of each ethnic group and clarifying their historical development not only provides a basis for the Party and the government in determining ethnic policies and helping each ethnic group transition to socialist society according to their own characteristics, but also provides rich materials for academic research on the history of each ethnic group and the history of human social development.

    新疆民族社会历史情况调查组
    到达和阗专区进行实地调查
    本报讯　新疆民族社会历史情况调查组已先后到达和阗，将在和阗专区进行三个月的实地调查。这个调查组于9月上旬组成，它的主要任务是调查研究解放前新疆各民族的社会性质及各民族的近百年史，并结合进行古代史、民族关系及考古等方面的调查研究工作。参加调查组工作的有中国科学院、中央民族学院、自治区各有关单位的教授、研究人员、干部及大学毕业生共三十人。调查时间是四年至七年。他们在出发前，曾经进行了学习，并与有关人士进行了座谈。新疆各民族在解放前具有不同的社会历史发展特点，调查研究各民族的社会经济结构，弄清其历史发展情况，不仅可以作党和政府在确定民族政策方面的依据，帮助各民族按照本民族特点过渡到社会主义社会，而且可以为研究各民族历史及人类社会发展史等学术研究工作提供丰富的材料。
