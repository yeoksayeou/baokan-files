    Impromptu Quatrains Written While Visiting Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Mausoleum on the Occasion of His Ninetieth Birthday
    Li Jishen
    It has been ten years since I last visited Mr. Sun's tomb,
    Today I come to pay my respects, his spirit seemingly present.
    After all, he learned from Russia and opened the path to awakening,
    The people's victory is unprecedented in history.
    The trees on Sun Yat-sen's Mausoleum remain evergreen,
    The glory of the nation shines like a star.
    The success of the revolution is seen today,
    We offer our heartfelt comfort to his spirit in heaven.
    This visit to the mausoleum is an unprecedented grand occasion,
    Looking at the present and recalling the past, emotions are overwhelming.
    We should only be good at carrying on Mr. Sun's aspirations,
    And jointly inherit the revolutionary spirit.

    孙中山先生九旬诞辰谒陵口占三绝句
    李济深
    十年不谒先生墓，
    今日来瞻思宛然，
    毕竟师俄开觉路，
    人民胜利史无前。
    中山陵上树长青，
    民族光辉炳若星，
    革命成功看今日，
    同声告慰在天灵。
    盛典空前此谒陵，
    抚今追昔感难胜，
    只应善替先生志，
    革命精神共继承。
