Glorious Mothers
Xia Minzhi

Among the representatives attending the National Congress of Active Elements in Socialist Construction of Revolutionary Martyrs' Families, Military Dependents, Disabled Soldiers, and Demobilized Soldiers, there are many martyrs' family members who are praised as "Glorious Mothers" and "Revolutionary Mothers." In the long and arduous revolutionary struggle, they not only contributed their loved ones but were also unyielding fighters themselves.

As early as the Great Revolution period, Comrade Peng Pai, a famous peasant movement leader, led peasants in Guangdong to carry out the land revolution. Not only did the reactionaries want to assassinate him, but his own landlord family also opposed him. At that time, only his mother, Peng's mother, who was born into a poor family and married into a landlord family, supported and sympathized with Comrade Peng Pai. When Comrade Peng Pai secretly convened meetings of peasants, she helped to contact people and kept watch for them. Sometimes, she had to distract Peng Pai's second elder brother, engaging him so that he would not disrupt Peng Pai's revolutionary activities.

After the failure of the Great Revolution, Comrade Peng Pai was killed by the Kuomintang reactionaries, and Peng's mother fled to Hong Kong, Macau, and other places to take refuge. During this time, she continued to work, sheltering revolutionary comrades, collecting secret documents, and serving as a liaison and communicator. On one occasion, she was discovered and arrested by the enemy, subjected to various forms of persecution, but she remained steadfast and did not reveal any Party secrets to the enemy. Later, she was released through the rescue of people from all walks of life.

During the Second Domestic Revolutionary War period, Xu Zhengxiu's mother and Wang Yuexiang's mother, who lost their husbands and sons in battle, were both heroic fighters. At that time, they both worked in the Soviet government. Xu's mother was a member of the Women's Federation. Wang's mother was the women's squad leader and propagandist of the Red Guards. Even now, she still remembers some Red Army songs. When we visited her, she happily sang for us:

　　To be a soldier, be a Red Army soldier,
　　Welcomed by workers and peasants everywhere;
　　Officers and soldiers are the same,
　　No one to oppress others.

Wang's mother is a strong and optimistic revolutionary mother. During the third counter-encirclement campaign, she led women to deliver food to the Red Army guerrillas. Once, on the way, they were ambushed by the enemy. Bullets whizzed around them, and the enemy was about to catch up. Disregarding the danger, each of them carried more than a hundred catties of grain and ran desperately. The Red Army soldiers on the hilltop shouted, "Wang Yuexiang! Quickly drop the grain and take cover!" But they continued to climb up the mountain until they delivered the grain to the Red Army.

Xu Zhengxiu's mother is already sixty-nine years old, and she still has scars on her neck from being hung and beaten by the Kuomintang reactionaries. In 1927, Xu's mother's husband and eldest son both joined the Red Army, and she served as a standing committee member of the Women's Federation in her village. Later, the reactionaries attacked, and the Red Army retreated. The Kuomintang arrested Xu's mother and subjected her to severe torture, demanding that she reveal information about the Red Army personnel, weapons, and supplies. She thought, "My son is in the Red Army, and my husband and three brothers from my natal family have shed their last drop of blood for the revolution. I must be worthy of the revolution, worthy of my husband and brothers, and I must never yield to the enemy." Thus, although she suffered all kinds of torture, she did not reveal any information about the Red Army. During the long days of white terror, the reactionaries restricted her activities for a long time, but she still secretly persisted in working for the revolution. In 1944, when the New Fourth Army troops came to Hong'an County to fight guerrillas, she organized women to deliver grain and intelligence to the New Fourth Army. On one occasion, our troops moved to Changxidian, and Xu's mother learned that the Kuomintang was organizing a large force to encircle and attack. She immediately sent someone to run more than ten miles to deliver the message, enabling the troops to transfer safely.

During the War of Resistance Against Japan, everyone in the Qiongya Anti-Japanese Column on Hainan Island knew that there was a "Revolutionary Mother" in Wenchang County, Grandma Ye San. Grandma Ye San sent her only grandson to the Qiongya Anti-Japanese Column, and then mobilized her grandson's wife to join the army. Later, her grandson and grandson's wife both gloriously sacrificed in battle. The fighting will of this lonely old mother became even stronger. In the arduous combat environment, she often went out to scout enemy positions, deliver secret documents, deliver firewood and food to the army, and take care of the wounded. Often, several or dozens of wounded soldiers recuperated in her home. She treated the wounded soldiers like her own sons, boiling water, cooking food, and taking care of them meticulously. The commanders and fighters of the troops also loved her very much. The soldiers often said, "Our home is Grandma Ye San's home, and Grandma Ye San is our mother."

These glorious mothers who sacrificed their loved ones for the revolution have such kind hearts and such noble qualities. They do not care about personal gains or losses at all. After liberation, the Party and the government took good care of them, but these "Glorious Mothers" all want to actively participate in socialist construction with their own labor and continue to work for the unfinished cause of their loved ones. Although they are mostly old people in their sixties and seventies, they still serve as chairmen, directors, or committee members in cooperatives, and serve as deputies and committee members of the provincial and county people's congresses.

Last year, when Guangdong Province was in the upsurge of agricultural cooperativization, Comrade Peng Pai's mother had someone help her walk eight miles to Chishan Township, the key township where Comrade Peng Pai first engaged in land revolution. This eighty-three-year-old Peng's mother said at the peasant congress, "Your township is the birthplace of Peng Pai's land revolution. His wish at that time was to eliminate the exploitation system, so that everyone would have land to cultivate, and then move towards a happy socialism. If my son could see you organizing cooperatives now, he would be very happy." After her speech, many peasants expressed their intention to join the cooperative on the spot, thanking Peng's mother and her son for their hope and guidance. In September of this year, when Peng's mother heard that some peasants in the Chengguang District had concerns about joining the cooperative, she went to the district to visit the concerned peasants and explain the benefits of agricultural cooperativization.

Xu Zhengxiu's mother mobilized people door-to-door to transform mutual aid teams into cooperatives as early as 1954. At first, the cadres in the district, because of their conservative thinking, ignored their request. But this did not shake her determination to adhere to the socialist road. She applied seven times in a row, and the cooperative she led was finally approved in February 1955.

Grandma Ye San is already seventy years old and is still engaged in production in the fields, serving as a committee member of the advanced cooperative and the captain of the production team. She still cannot spend all the grain and money she earns through labor. She takes the lead in buying public bonds and selling surplus grain. When there was a drought last year, she took the lead in waterlogging and drought resistance, persisting for three days and three nights. She was so tired that she could only sleep by the stream for a while.

Wang Yuexiang's mother not only does not want government subsidies and does not want the masses to cultivate for her, but also helps the family of martyr Zhong Zhangshi and the lonely old deaf-mute Zhong Fuchang solve their livelihood difficulties every year. When there was a shortage of grain in the spring famine last year, she gave the grain to others and ate green vegetables and taro herself. The masses trust her and listen to her. Not only do they go to her for problems in production and work, but also for marital discord and girls looking for objects, they also go to her to discuss.

Qi Yuanxiang, the mother of Volunteer Army First-Class Combat Hero Li Jiafa, is the chairman of an advanced cooperative with 2,580 households. In 1954, Wuwei County suffered a major flood, and many mutual aid teams collapsed. However, she transformed the mutual aid team into a primary cooperative with 22 households under the most difficult circumstances. Because she started by solving the livelihood difficulties of the members and made reasonable organization of the labor force, the production was developed, which attracted more people to participate in the cooperative she led. During the spring plowing production last year, there was a shortage of animal power, so she organized manpower to pull plows. She personally went down the slope and pulled for three days, influencing many young women to go to the fields to pull plows, so that the spring plowing task was completed in time.

    光荣的妈妈们
    夏敏之
    在出席全国烈属、军属、残废军人、复员军人社会主义建设积极分子大会的代表中，有许多被誉为“光荣妈妈”、“革命母亲”的烈士家属，在长期艰苦的革命斗争中，她们不仅贡献了自己的亲人，并且自己也是坚强不屈的战士。
    远在大革命时期，著名的农民运动家彭湃同志在广东领导农民进行土地革命，不但反动派想暗害他，自己的地主家庭也反对他。当时只有他的母亲，这位生在贫穷人家被嫁到地主家庭的彭妈妈，是支持和同情彭湃同志的。彭湃同志秘密召集农民开会的时候，她就帮助联络人，给他们放哨，有时候她还必须把彭湃同志的二哥支吾出去，缠住他，不让他去破坏彭湃同志的革命活动。
    大革命失败以后，彭湃同志被国民党反动派杀害了，彭妈妈逃到香港、澳门等地避难。这时，她还一直坚持工作，掩护革命同志，收藏秘密文件，担任联络通信。有一次她被敌人发觉逮捕，受到各种迫害，但是她坚贞不屈，没有向敌人暴露一点党的秘密。后来经过社会人士的援救，才得到释放。
    在第二次国内革命战争时期，在战斗中失去了丈夫和儿子的徐正修妈妈和王月香妈妈，都曾经是英勇的战士。当时她们都在苏维埃政府里担任工作。徐妈妈是妇女会的委员。王妈妈是赤卫队的妇女班长和宣传员，直到现在，她还记着一些红军歌曲。我们访问她的时候，她曾愉快地给我们唱道：
  当兵就要当红军，
  处处工农来欢迎；
  官长士兵是一样，
  没有人来压迫人。
    王妈妈是一位坚强、乐观的革命母亲。在第三次反围剿中，她领导妇女给红军游击队送粮，有一次在路上受到了敌人的夹击，子弹嗖嗖地在身边乱飞，眼看敌人就追上来了。她们不顾危险，每人挑着一百多斤粮食拚命地跑。山顶上的红军战士们高声招呼：“王月香啊！你们快把粮食丢下掩蔽起来吧！”但是她们还是不停地往山上爬，直到把粮食送到红军手里。
    徐正修妈妈已经六十九岁了，现在她的脖子上还留着被国民党反动派吊打的伤疤。1927年，徐妈妈的丈夫和大儿子都参加了红军，她在乡里担任妇女会常务委员。后来，反动派进攻，红军撤退了。国民党抓去了徐妈妈，对她进行严刑拷打，要她说出红军的人员、枪枝和物资情况。她想：“儿子在红军里，丈夫和娘家的三个兄弟已经为革命流了最后一滴血，我要对得起革命，对得起丈夫和兄弟，决不能向敌人屈服。”就这样，她虽然受尽酷刑，可是一点也没有暴露红军的情况。在漫长的白色恐怖的日子里，反动派长期限制她的活动，她自己仍然秘密地坚持为革命工作。1944年新四军部队到红安县打游击，她就组织妇女给新四军送粮，送情报。有一次，我们的部队移驻在长西店，徐妈妈打听到国民党要组织大部队去围攻，就立即派人跑了十多里路去送信，使部队安全转移。
    抗日战争中，海南岛的琼崖抗日纵队里，人人都知道文昌县有一位“革命母亲”叶三婆。叶三婆把自己仅有的一个孙子送到琼崖抗日纵队去，随后又动员孙子媳妇参加了部队。以后，她孙子和孙子媳妇都在战斗中光荣牺牲。这个孤老妈妈的斗争意志却更坚强了。她在坚苦的战斗环境里，经常外出探听敌情，递送秘密文件，给军队送柴送饭，照顾伤员。经常有几名或十几名伤员在她家里休养，她就像对待亲生儿子一样，给伤员烧水做饭，端屎端尿，看护得无微不至。部队的指战员也都十分热爱她，战士们常说：“我们的家就是叶三婆的家，叶三婆就是我们的妈妈。”
    为革命献出亲人的这些光荣妈妈们，心地是那样善良、品质是那样高尚。她们丝毫不计较个人得失。解放了，党和政府妥善地照顾她们，但这些“光荣妈妈”都要用自己的劳动积极参加社会主义建设，为自己亲人未竟的事业继续努力。她们虽然大都是六、七十岁的老人了，还在合作社里担任着社长、主任或社委的职务，担任着省、县人民代表和委员的职务。
    去年，广东省正处在农业合作化高潮的时候，彭湃同志的妈妈叫人扶着她走了八里路，来到了彭湃同志最初搞土地革命的重点乡——赤山乡。这位八十三岁的彭妈妈在农民大会上说：“你们这个乡是彭湃搞土地革命的发源地，他当时的愿望就是消灭剥削制度，使大家都有地种，然后再走向幸福的社会主义。要是我的儿子现在看到你们组织合作社，他一定很高兴。”她讲话以后，很多农民就当场表示要参加合作社，感谢彭妈妈和他的儿子对他们的希望和教导。今年9月，彭妈妈听说城光区有些农民对参加合作社有顾虑，她就到这个区去登门访问有顾虑的农民，解释农业合作化的好处。
    徐正修妈妈在1954年就挨门挨户动员人们由互助组转成合作社。开始，区里的干部因为有保守思想。不理睬他们的请求。但这丝毫也没有动摇她坚持走社会主义道路的决心，她一连申请了七次，她所领导的合作社终于在1955年2月被批准成立。
    叶三婆妈妈已经七十岁了，现在还是下地生产，担任着高级社社委，生产队队长的职务，她现在靠劳动分的粮食和钱，还吃不了用不了，买公债、卖余粮她都带头。去年抗旱的时候，她带头戽水抗旱，一直坚持了三天三夜，实在累的不行了，才在溪边睡一会。
    王月香妈妈不光不要政府补助，不要群众们代耕，而且每年都帮助烈属钟张氏和孤老哑叭钟甫昌解决生活困难。去年春荒缺粮的时候，她把粮食送给别人，自己吃青菜，芋头。群众信任她，听从她，不光生产上和工作上有问题去找她，就是夫妇不和，姑娘找对象也去和她商量。
    志愿军一级战斗英雄李家发烈士的母亲戚元香，是一位领导着两千五百八十户高级合作社的社长。1954年无为县遭到大水灾，很多互助组垮台了，而她却在最困难的情况下，使互助组转为二十二户的初级社，由于她从解决社员生活困难着手，对劳动力作了合理的组织，使生产得到了发展，就吸引着更多的人参加了她领导的合作社。去年春耕生产时，畜力缺乏，她就组织人力拉犁。她亲自下坡拉了三天，影响了许多年轻的妇女也纷纷下地拉犁，使春耕任务及时完成了。
