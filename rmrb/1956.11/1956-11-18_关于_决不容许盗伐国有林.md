Response to Criticism

    Regarding “Absolutely No Allowance for Illegal Logging of State-Owned Forests”
    The reader's letter "Absolutely No Allowance for Illegal Logging of State-Owned Forests," published on page three of this newspaper on August 30th, exposed the fact that the Qiyang County Post and Telecommunications Bureau in Hunan Province had felled 338 pine trees in state-owned forests. Recently, the Qiyang County Post and Telecommunications Bureau replied, stating that the logging should not be the responsibility of the bureau, because the post and telecommunications bureau was only responsible for the construction work during the installation of telephone lines, while the county people's committee was responsible for procuring the line materials. Moreover, the more than 1,300 trees needed for the installation of telephone lines this spring had already been reported by the Transportation Section of the County People's Committee and approved by the leading authorities to be felled in public forests. Later, the telephone lines installed in the Jindong Forest Area passed through dense fir forests, so 376 fir trees obstructing the lines were felled. The Post and Telecommunications Bureau believes that this was necessary to meet the requirements of installing telecommunication lines. Seventy-eight of the felled fir trees were used as telephone poles. This was also done after the County Transportation Section sought instructions from higher authorities. (Editor's note: According to investigations, many instances of forest felling have occurred in Qiyang County this year. The Qiyang County Party and government leading bodies should investigate and handle different situations separately to determine which are legal and which are illegal, and take effective measures to prevent acts of forest destruction.)

### 关于“决不容许盗伐国有林”

    关于“决不容许盗伐国有林”
    8月30日本报三版发表的读者来信“决不容许盗伐国有林”，曾经揭发湖南祁阳县邮电局砍伐国有林中的松树三百三十八棵。最近祁阳县邮电局来信答复说：砍伐林木的事不应由该局负责，因为邮电局在架设电话线工程中，只负责施工、线路材料由县人民委员会负责筹措。而且，今年春季架设电话线所需要的木料一千三百多棵，都早已由县人民委员会交通科报请领导机关批准在公有林中砍伐。后来在金洞林区内架设的电话线，因为是在稠密的杉木林中穿过，所以曾经砍去阻碍架线的杉木三百七十六棵。邮电局认为，这是根据架设电讯线路的要求必须砍去的。砍掉的杉木中有七十八棵被用做电线杆。这样做，也是经县交通科向上级请示过的。（编者按：据调查，祁阳县今年发生砍伐森林的事很多。究竟那些是合法的，那些是违法的，应由祁阳县党政领导机关分别不同情况进行研究和处理，并采取防止破坏森林行为的有效措施。）
