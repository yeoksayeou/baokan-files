Xinhua News Agency, 12th: Premier Zhou Enlai sent a cable to President Nasser, the full text of which is as follows: To His Excellency President Gamal Abdel Nasser:

	On behalf of the government and people of the People's Republic of China, I extend my respects to the Egyptian people who are heroically resisting the aggression of British and French imperialism and their tool Israel, and resolutely defending the independence and freedom of their motherland. I assure you that we stand firmly with you.

	British and French imperialism dream of using the decadent "gunboat policy" to restore their rule over Egypt. American imperialism is condoning and exploiting the aggression of Britain and France in an attempt to profit from it. But in today's era, their conspiracies are doomed to fail. Although Britain and France have temporary military advantages over Egypt, they are opposed by the people of the world and the vast majority of countries. They are in an unprecedentedly isolated position and have been completely bankrupt morally. Justice is entirely on the side of Egypt. The people of Arab countries, the people of Asian and African countries, and all peace-loving and justice-upholding countries in the world support you. Therefore, as long as the Egyptian people can strengthen their unity and persist in their struggle, final victory will surely belong to the heroic Egyptian people.

	The Chinese government and the Chinese people fully support the just struggle of the Egyptian people. British and French imperialism and Israel must immediately cease their aggression and immediately withdraw their invading troops from Egyptian territory. Egypt's sovereignty and territory must not be violated in any form.

	The Chinese government and the Chinese people are taking various measures to support the heroic struggle of the Egyptian government and the Egyptian people. The Chinese government has decided to donate 20 million Swiss francs in cash to Egypt free of charge, in response to your government's recent appeal.

	On behalf of the Chinese people, I once again express my highest respect to you and the entire Egyptian people.
							Premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China, Zhou Enlai
                                        November 10, 1956, in Beijing

    周总理电纳赛尔支持反侵略斗争
    中国政府决定赠送埃及二千万瑞士法郎
    新华社12日讯　周恩来总理致纳赛尔总统电，全文如下：加麦尔·阿卜杜勒·纳赛尔总统阁下：
    我代表中华人民共和国政府和人民，向英勇反抗英法帝国主义和它们的工具以色列的侵略、坚决保卫自己祖国的独立和自由的埃及人民致敬，并且向你们保证，我们坚定不移地同你们站在一起。
    英法帝国主义梦想用腐朽的“炮舰政策”，恢复他们对埃及的统治。美帝国主义正在纵容和利用英法的侵略，企图从中渔利。但是在今天的时代里，它们的这些阴谋是注定了要失败的。尽管英法对埃及拥有暂时的军事优势，但是它们遭到了全世界人民和绝大多数国家的反对，处于空前孤立的地位，在道义上已经彻底破产。正义完全在埃及的一边。阿拉伯各国人民，亚非各国人民，全世界一切爱好和平和主持正义的各国人民都支持你们。因此，只要埃及人民能够加强团结，坚持斗争，最后胜利必然属于英勇的埃及人民。
    中国政府和中国人民完全支持埃及人民的正义斗争。英法帝国主义和以色列必须立即停止它们的侵略，从埃及领土上立即撤出它们的侵略军队。埃及的主权和领土决不容许遭受任何形式的侵犯。
    中国政府和中国人民，正在采取各种措施支援埃及政府和埃及人民的英勇斗争。中国政府决定以二千万瑞士法郎的现金无偿地送给埃及，响应贵国政府最近的呼吁。
    我代表中国人民再一次向你和全体埃及人民表示最崇高的敬意。
                            中华人民共和国国务院总理　周恩来
                                        1956年11月10日于北京
