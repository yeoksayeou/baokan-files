    Support the Egyptian People Against Anglo-French Aggression
    At noon on November 1st, we listened to the radio broadcast of our government's statement protesting the armed invasion of Egypt by British and French colonialists and the news that Britain and France had launched a war of aggression against Egypt. We express our complete support for our government's statement. We express our great anger and firm protest against the aggressive acts of British and French colonialism.
    After all the conspiracies and tricks of British and French imperialism on the Suez Canal issue were completely bankrupt, they disregarded the most basic principles of international relations and launched an armed provocation to invade Egyptian sovereignty and seize the Suez Canal. The flames of war ignited by Britain and France in Egypt not only destroyed peace in the Middle East but also posed a serious threat to world peace. This desperate, last-ditch gamble by British and French colonialists will not bring them any benefit.
    We want to warn the British and French colonialists that the era of imperialist high-handedness is gone forever. Now, the just struggle of the Egyptian people is supported by the Arab people who share their hatred of the enemy. We, the Chinese people, resolutely support the just struggle of the Egyptian people. The struggle of the Egyptian people, supported by the people of the world, will surely achieve final victory. If the British and French imperialists are obsessed with their own way, they will surely play with fire and burn themselves. Beijing Lei Hengmin, Lu Yucun, and ten others
    We heard the news of the armed aggression against Egypt by British and French imperialism with extreme anger. We express our strong condemnation and protest against this aggressive act of British and French imperialism, which violates the United Nations Charter and undermines world peace. We fully support the solemn statement issued by our government on this event and firmly support the just struggle of the Egyptian people to safeguard national sovereignty and defend national independence.
    We solemnly warn the British and French imperialist aggressors that you must immediately stop this criminal activity, otherwise, you will play with fire and burn yourselves.
    We once again express our full support for the just struggle of the Egyptian people.
    Teachers of the Chinese Department of Beijing Normal University Li Jinxi, Huang Yaomian, Zhong Jingwen, and forty-six others
    After reading the newspaper on the 1st, all the faculty and staff of Beijing No. 2 Women's Middle School expressed great indignation at the crimes of British and French armed invasion of Egyptian territory and undermining world peace. After all their attempts to infringe upon Egyptian sovereignty failed, the British and French imperialists shamelessly instigated Israel to launch an armed attack on Egypt and issued a barbaric so-called "ultimatum" to Egypt, demanding to seize the Suez Canal area of Egypt. This is the evidence of armed aggression, arson, and destruction of world peace. We will never allow them to do this! If the British and French imperialists do not stop this adventurous aggression in time, resulting in more serious consequences, all responsibility should be borne by the British and French imperialists.
    We believe that President Nasser's righteous and stern rejection of the "ultimatum" of British and French imperialism and his mobilization of the people to resist aggression is wise and just. We express our heartfelt admiration and support.
    We are determined to fully support the just actions of the Egyptian government and the Egyptian people in resolutely resisting aggression and defending world peace, and we are willing to do whatever we are needed to do! We will go all out until the Egyptian people's struggle achieves final victory. Beijing All faculty and staff of No. 2 Women's Middle School
    When we heard the news that Israel unreasonably launched an armed invasion of Egypt and that British and French imperialism issued a so-called "ultimatum" to Egypt, the students of Beijing No. 27 Middle School unanimously expressed unparalleled indignation at these shameless acts of aggression.
    We fully support President Nasser's just action in rejecting the British and French "ultimatum" in order to safeguard Egypt's sovereignty and dignity, and the heroic struggle of the Egyptian people.
    We Chinese youth are peace-loving and independent, and resolutely oppose colonialist aggression. We oppose any country infringing upon the sovereignty of another country. If the British and French imperialists do not stop their aggression, they will be opposed by the people of the world. We will do our best to support the Egyptian people. When necessary, we are willing to be volunteers to participate in the anti-aggression struggle. We will save our pocket money to donate weapons to fight against aggression. We are confident that the just struggle of the Egyptian people will surely achieve final victory.
    Egyptian young friends, fight hard! Peace-loving people all over the world stand with you, let us fight together for peace!
                 All the students of the second class of the second year of high school, Beijing No. 27 Middle School
    We are a group of third-year college students. We love peace. We cherish the independence and freedom that the Egyptian people have achieved, and we are encouraged and cheered by every victory of the Egyptian people! We see that the British and French colonialists are viciously plotting to have Israeli armed forces invade the sacred territory of Egypt. This shameless collusion and criminal act by Britain, France, and Israel is not only a provocation to the Egyptian people but also a serious provocation to the Arab countries and all peace-loving and justice-seeking people in the world.
    Now, Britain and France have openly dispatched naval and air forces to invade Egyptian territory. We are filled with righteous indignation and uncontrollable anger at this aggressive act by Britain, France, and Israel. We firmly declare: We stand unswervingly on the side of the just Egyptian people, and we are determined to use all our strength to support the Egyptian people. If necessary, we are willing to give up our pens and join the army, leave our beloved motherland, and fight alongside the Egyptian people for the independence and freedom of Egypt, to smash imperialist armed aggression, and to fight for peace!
    We warn the British and French colonialists: those who play with fire will burn themselves. Your armed provocation to seize the Suez Canal and invade Egyptian territory will surely be met with shameful defeat! Your conspiracy will not succeed. The Egyptian people have the support of hundreds of millions of just people. The Egyptian people are not isolated.
    We advise the Israeli youth who are being driven to the battlefield to lay down your weapons of murder, stop your criminal acts, and do not be cannon fodder for Western colonialists to slaughter your neighbors.
           Students of Beijing Institute of Geology Yang Ruiqi, Wan Zhijing, and twenty-eight others
    We finished reading the newspaper with indignation about Israel's barbaric actions and the sinister conspiracies of Britain and France. The times no longer allow anyone to enslave and invade another nation by force. But Israel dared to invade Egypt under the instigation of Britain and France. This is not allowed by any righteous people. Egypt is no longer the Egypt of the past. It does not allow anyone to infringe upon its sovereignty or destroy its freedom. The Chinese people will never tolerate this act of aggression. We must fully support Egypt. We must help Egypt and warn those war fanatics that war can only lead to the accelerated demise of the colonialists! We are willing to dedicate our strength to defending Egypt. We stand unhesitatingly with the Egyptian people to fight for world peace!
                Beijing Zhang Fucang, Yang Sili, Liu Yunge, and forty others
    When we heard that the Egyptian people, who were fighting to defend their national independence and territorial integrity, were subjected to armed aggression by British and French colonialism, we could no longer contain the anger in our hearts. We protest with unparalleled indignation against the despicable conspiracies and barbaric actions of British and French imperialism. We extend our greatest sympathy to the people and youth of Egypt. The British and French imperialists who play with fire will surely eat their own bitter fruit. The just anti-aggression struggle of the Egyptian people will surely achieve final victory. We are willing to serve as volunteer soldiers and fight alongside the Egyptian people to bury the invaders in the place where they launched the aggression. Beijing Guo Bin, Zhong Ming, and ten others
    After openly instigating Israel to invade Egypt, British and French imperialism launched a dirty war of aggression against Egypt under the pretext of "maintaining the navigation of the Suez Canal." Everyone of us feels extremely angry about this! The barbaric actions of British and French imperialism are an infringement on Egypt's sacred sovereignty and a provocation to peace-loving people all over the world!
    The Egyptian people and the Chinese people are like brothers. We have always been concerned about the heroic struggle of the Egyptian people. We firmly protest against the armed invasion of Egypt by British and French imperialism. We firmly support the just anti-aggression struggle of the Egyptian people.
    Victory belongs to the Egyptian people! If imperialism does not heed the countless historical lessons, it will be buried by the anti-colonialist wave of anger of the people all over the world!
                   All staff members of the Communist Youth League Dongcheng District Committee, Beijing
    Just as the world situation is becoming more and more relaxed, British and French imperialism has once again ignited the flames of war in the Middle East. The British and French imperialists are attempting to reoccupy the Suez Canal, enslave the Egyptian people, and carry out colonial rule over the entire Arab East. We want to warn the imperialists: if you do not immediately stop your criminal actions of aggression against Egypt, you will only arouse greater indignation from all those who uphold justice around the world, and in the end, you are bound to suffer a shameful defeat.
    We—Chinese young students—will fully support the struggle of Egyptian youth, support the Egyptian people who are fighting to defend the sacred territory of their motherland, and support the Egyptian people who are fighting to defend their national sovereignty and independence! Beijing Zhou Hailong, Zhang Naizheng, and seven others
    When we heard the news that the British and French colonialists had openly launched a war of aggression against Egypt, the anger in our hearts could not be calmed down. This jackal behavior of Britain and France is not only a provocation to the Egyptian people but also a mad provocation to world peace!
    The hearts of us—ten young journalists—have now flown to the banks of the Nile, and our pulses beat together with the pulses of the Egyptian people. We cannot tolerate the imperialist acts of murder and arson. If necessary, we are willing to use all our strength to support the just struggle of the Egyptian people.
    The dead-end imperialism is bound to fail, and victory must belong to the Egyptian people.
               Beijing Mao Zhihan, He Lison, Peng Jun, and ten others
    I was very angry when I heard the radio report at 9:20 pm on the 1st that Britain and France had begun bombing Cairo. The ugly nature of imperialism is fully exposed. This barbaric act of British and French imperialism will never succeed. I firmly support the just struggle of the Egyptian people. If necessary, I will be the first to request to go to Egypt to help the Egyptian people defeat the hateful aggressors!
                Zhang Qingduo, Beijing Jingmen Medical Equipment Factory, Dongcheng District
    We expressed what was in our hearts with very excited and angry feelings.
    As peace-loving Chinese students, we lodge a strong protest to the governments of Britain and France against the British and French invasion of Egypt. The robber behavior of British and French imperialism must be stopped.
    Today, the students of Egypt have stopped attending classes and are about to embark on a journey to fight against colonialism, and we express our firm support for this until the final victory of Egypt.
    We believe that with the support of peace-loving people all over the world, the Egyptian people will surely defeat British and French imperialism, and Britain and France will be subject to just sanctions.
    Now, we are paying close attention to the development of the situation in Egypt with all our strength. While stepping up our studies, we are preparing to support the Egyptian people.
        All comrades of the Sixth Branch of the First Grade of Beijing Foreign Trade Institute
    The news that British and French colonialists instructed Israel to openly disregard all international legal norms to invade Egyptian territory, and now they themselves have launched an armed invasion of Egypt and bombed peaceful cities in Egypt on a large scale, is really outrageous. I believe that the armed aggression against Egypt by British and French imperialism is not only a blatant provocation against Egypt and the Arab people but also a serious provocation against world peace and all peace-loving people.
    We must warn the British and French aggressors: today's era is no longer the era of Gordon and Napoleon; going against the tide will only make them sink deeper and deeper in the anti-colonialist wave, and in the end, they will surely suffer a major setback.
    I firmly oppose the barbaric act of British and French aggression against Egypt and undermining world peace; I indignantly condemn the arson collusion of Britain, France, and Israel, and express warm sympathy and full support to the Egyptian people's struggle to defend their motherland!

    支持埃及人民反对英法侵略
    11月1日中午，从广播中收听了我国政府抗议英、法殖民主义者武装侵犯埃及的声明和英、法对埃及发动了侵略战争的消息。我们对我国政府的声明，表示完全拥护。对于英、法殖民主义的侵略行为，表示极大的愤怒和坚决的抗议。
    英、法帝国主义在苏伊士运河问题上的一切阴谋诡计彻底破产以后，竟然不顾国际关系中最起码的准则，穷凶极恶地发动了武装侵犯埃及主权、夺取苏伊士运河的武装挑衅行动。英、法在埃及燃起的战火，不仅是破坏了中东的和平，而且是对世界和平的严重威胁。英、法殖民主义者这种穷途末路，孤注一掷的冒险，决不会给自己带来任何好处。
    我们要警告英、法殖民主义者，帝国主义横行霸道的时代已经一去不复返了。现在埃及人民的正义斗争得到同仇敌忾的阿拉伯人民的支援。我们中国人民坚决支持埃及人民的正义斗争。受到全世界人民支援的埃及人民的斗争，必将会得到最后胜利。英法帝国主义者如果执迷不悟，必将玩火自焚。　北京　雷亨民　陆雨村等十人
    我们以万分愤怒的心情听到了英法帝国主义武装侵略埃及的消息。我们对英法帝国主义的这种违反联合国宪章、破坏世界和平的侵略暴行表示强烈的谴责和抗议。我们完全支持我国政府对这一事件发表的严正声明，坚决支持埃及人民维护国家主权和保卫民族独立的正义斗争。
    我们严正警告英法帝国主义侵略者，你们必须立刻停止这种罪恶活动，否则必将玩火自焚。
    我们再一次表示全力支持埃及人民的正义斗争。
    北京师范大学中文系教师　黎锦熙　黄药眠　钟敬文等四十六人
    读完1日的报纸，我们北京女二中全体教职工对于英法武装侵犯埃及领土，破坏世界和平的罪行，无不表示极大的愤慨。英法帝国主义者在他们侵犯埃及主权的一切企图遭到失败之后，竟无耻地一面策动以色列向埃及进行武装进攻，一面对埃及提出侵犯埃及领土的蛮横的所谓“最后通牒”，要抢夺埃及的苏伊士运河区，这就是武装侵略、放火、破坏世界和平的罪证。我们绝不允许他们这样做！英法帝国主义者若不及时停止这种冒险侵略行为，以致引起更严重的后果，一切责任应由英法帝国主义者负担。
    我们认为纳赛尔总统义正词严地拒绝英法帝国主义的“最后通牒”，并动员全国人民来反抗侵略的措施是英明的，是正义的。我们表示衷心的敬佩和支持。
    埃及政府，埃及人民坚决反抗侵略，保卫世界和平的正义行为，我们决心全力支持，我们愿做任何需要我们做的事！我们将全力以赴，直到埃及人民的斗争取得最后的胜利。　北京　女二中全体教职工
    当我们听到以色列无理的向埃及进行武装侵略，英法帝国主义向埃及提出所谓“最后通谍”的消息时，我们北京二十七中的学生对这些无耻的侵略行为，一致表示无比的愤慨。
    我们完全支持纳赛尔总统为维护埃及的主权和尊严而拒绝英、法“最后通牒”的正义行动和埃及人民的英勇斗争。
    我们中国青年是热爱和平、独立的，坚决反对殖民主义侵略。我们反对任何国家侵犯别国的主权。如果英法帝国主义不停止它的侵略行为，它将遭到世界人民的反对。我们将尽最大努力支援埃及人民，在必要的时候，我们愿意作一名志愿兵参加反侵略的斗争，我们要节省零用钱来捐献反侵略的武器，我们确信埃及人民的正义的斗争一定会取得最后胜利。
    埃及的青年朋友们、努力战斗吧！全世界爱好和平的人民都和你们站在一起，让我们共同为和平事业奋斗到底！
                 北京　二十七中高二二班全体同学
    我们是一群大学三年级的青年学生。我们酷爱和平。我们珍视埃及人民已经取得的独立和自由，我们为埃及人民的每一个胜利而鼓舞、欢呼！我们看到英法殖民主义者穷凶恶极地策划以色列武装部队侵犯埃及的神圣领土，英、法和以色列的这种无耻勾当和罪恶行为，不仅是对埃及人民的挑衅，同时也是对阿拉伯国家和全世界爱好和平和正义的人民的严重挑衅。
    现在，英法公然出动海空军侵犯埃及领土，我们对英、法、以的这种侵略行为义愤填膺、怒不可遏。我们坚决表示：我们坚定不移地站在正义的埃及人民一边，我们决心将用一切力量支援埃及人民，必要时我们愿意投笔从戎，离开我们亲爱的祖国，和埃及人民一道为埃及的独立和自由而战，为粉碎帝国主义的武装侵略而战，为和平而战！
    我们警告英法殖民者：玩火必自焚其身，你们阴谋夺取苏伊士运河而发动侵犯埃及领土的武装挑衅行动必将遭到可耻的失败！你们的阴谋是不能得逞的，埃及人民有着亿万正义人民的支援，埃及人民是不孤立的。
    我们劝告被驱使战场的以色列青年，放下你们手中的杀人武器，停止你们的罪恶行为，不要替西方殖民者充当炮灰、屠杀自己的邻人。
           北京地质学院学生　杨瑞琪　万之静等二十八人
    我们以愤慨的心情看完了报上所刊登的以色列的野蛮行动和英法阴险的阴谋。时代已不允许任何人再以武力去奴役和侵略另外一个民族。但以色列居然敢在英法的驱使下对埃及进行侵略。这是任何正义的人们所不允许的。埃及已不是过去的埃及，它不允许任何人侵犯它的主权、不允许任何人破坏它的自由。中国人也决不容忍这种侵略行动。我们一定要全力支援埃及，我们要援助埃及，警告那些战争狂热者，战争带来的只能是殖民主义者的加速灭亡！我们愿意为保卫埃及而献出我们的力量。我们毫不犹豫和埃及人民站在一起为世界和平而战！
                北京　张福苍　杨思立　刘云阁等四十人
    当我们听到为维护自己民族独立和领土主权完整而斗争的埃及人民遭到英法殖民主义的武装侵略的时候，使我们再也按捺不住心头的怒火。我们以无比愤慨的心情抗议英法帝国主义的卑鄙阴谋和野蛮行动。我们以最大的同情寄予埃及的人民和青年。玩火自焚的英法帝国主义者必将自食恶果，埃及人民正义的反侵略斗争一定得到最后胜利，我们愿意作为志愿战士和埃及人民并肩作战，把侵略者埋葬在他们发动侵略的地方。　北京　郭滨　钟明等十人
    英法帝国主义公然在指使以色列侵略埃及之后，借口“维护苏伊士运河通航”，发动了侵略埃及的肮脏战争，我们每个人都对此感到无比的愤怒！英法帝国主义的野蛮行为，是对埃及神圣主权的侵犯，也是向全世界爱好和平的人民的挑衅！
    埃及人民和中国人民像兄弟一样，我们一向关怀着埃及人民的英勇斗争。对于英法帝国主义武装侵犯埃及的行为，我们坚决表示抗议。我们坚决支持埃及人民的正义的反侵略斗争。
    胜利是属于埃及人民的！帝国主义如不记取无数的历史教训，必将为全世界人民反殖民主义的怒潮所埋葬！
                   青年团北京市东单区委员会全体工作人员
    正当世界局势日趋和缓的时候，英、法帝国主义又在中近东燃起了战火。英、法帝国主义者妄图重新占领苏伊士运河，奴役埃及人民，对整个阿拉伯东方进行殖民统治。我们要警告帝国主义者：你们如果不立即停止侵略埃及的罪恶行动，只会激起全世界维护正义的人们的更大愤慨，最后你们是一定要遭到可耻的失败的。
    我们——中国青年学生，将全力支持埃及青年的斗争，支持为保卫祖国神圣领土而战的埃及人民，支持为捍卫祖国主权和独立而战的埃及人民！　北京　周海龙　张乃整等七人
    当我们听到英法殖民者公然向埃及发动侵略战争的消息以后，愤怒的心情一直无法平息。英法这种豺狼行为不但是对埃及人民的挑衅，而且也是对世界和平的疯狂挑衅！
    我们——十个年轻的新闻工作者——的心现在已经飞到尼罗河畔，我们的脉搏与埃及人民的脉搏共同跳动，我们不能够容忍帝国主义的杀人放火的行为。如果需要，我们愿意把我们的全部力量都用来支持埃及人民的正义战斗。
    穷途末路的帝国主义是一定要失败的，胜利必定属于埃及人民。
               北京　毛智汉　何礼荪　彭　军等十人
    我在1日下午9点20分钟，听广播电台报告说，英法开始轰炸开罗，我非常愤怒。帝国主义的丑恶本质暴露无遗。英法帝国主义这种野蛮的行径是决不会得逞的。我坚决支持埃及人民的正义斗争，如果必要的话，我就要第一个要求去埃及，帮助埃及人民打退可恶的侵略者！
                北京东单区京门医疗器械工厂　张清铎
    我们以十分激动和愤怒的心情说出了我们内心的话。
    作为爱好和平的中国学生，对于英法侵略埃及一事，向英法两国政府提出强硬抗议。英法帝国主义的强盗行为必须停止。
    今天埃及的学生们已停课了，并即将踏上征途，进行反殖民主义的斗争，我们对此表示坚决的支持，直至埃及的最后胜利。
    我们相信：埃及人民在全世界爱好和平的人民支持之下，一定能战胜英法帝国主义，英法必将受到正义的制裁。
    现在，我们以全力注视着埃及情况的发展，我们一面加紧学习，一面准备着支援埃及人民。
        北京对外贸易学院一年级第六班团分支全体同志
    英法殖民者指使以色列公然无视一切国际法准则侵犯埃及领土，现在它们自己又对埃及发动了武装侵略，大举轰炸埃及的和平城市，这些消息实在令人发指。我认为，英、法帝国主义对埃及的武装侵略行为不但是对埃及和阿拉伯人民的猖狂挑衅，而且也是对世界和平和一切爱好和平的人民的严重挑衅。
    我们必须警告英法侵略者：今天的时代已经不是戈登、拿破仑的时代；倒行逆施只会使它们自己在反殖民主义的浪潮里愈陷愈深，最后必将大倒其霉。
    我坚决反对英法侵略埃及、破坏世界和平的野蛮行为；我愤慨地谴责英、法和以色列的纵火勾当，并且对埃及人民保卫祖国的斗争表示热烈的同情和全力支持！　北京　姚石冰
