    Strengthen Learning, Develop the Automobile Industry
    Meng Shaonong, Deputy Director of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant

    China's automobile industry was established on a backward industrial foundation, relying on Soviet technical assistance. Every aspect of automobile production is new and unfamiliar to us. How to master automobile production, become the masters of production technology, and make the first-class technical equipment provided by the Soviet Union operate smoothly is the main problem that the automobile factory had to solve during its establishment. To master new technologies and acquire new skills, we must continue to learn from the Soviet Union through production preparation and production practice, and use other possible methods.
    All employees of the automobile factory have a consistent understanding of learning, and their enthusiasm is very high. The objective conditions for learning are also particularly good. The Soviet Union has opened the door to automobile production technology, allowing us to receive care and assistance that can only be obtained from fraternal working class.
    However, until now, we are far from having learned to master the complete set of automobile production technology. We have only learned to start the machines. We have not yet studied automobile research, design, and production preparation, or we have only touched upon a very small part of it. We cannot produce one type of automobile for a long time, just as a publisher cannot always print one book. If we cannot master the comprehensive work of automobile research, design, and production preparation, and only have the ability to start the machines, then we cannot move forward.
    Even just in terms of starting the machines, we cannot say that we have learned well. Our automobile production is still very unstable. We have not yet familiarized ourselves with the performance of all the machines. There are still relatively many accidents and errors, and new technical problems are still emerging. Our ability to independently solve problems is still very insufficient. All of this indicates that we are still far from fully mastering automobile production technology. In the future, we must continue to intensify learning, strive to achieve independent development capabilities in the short term, and comprehensively advance to the world's advanced level.
    In future learning, learning methods are an extremely important issue. The automobile factory's past learning methods were basically correct and achieved results, but there were also shortcomings. The main shortcoming is the dogmatic learning method, which often grasps the form of Soviet advanced technology while ignoring the substance.
    In the early stage of the automobile factory's construction, we put forward the call to learn from the Soviet Union. At that time, most people did not understand Soviet technology. In order to strengthen the confidence in learning, and to implement the policy of relying on the Soviet Union in specific work, the factory's Party organization criticized the pro-American ideas existing among some engineering and technical personnel, and emphasized the need to resolutely implement Soviet designs and resolutely implement the suggestions of Soviet experts. This was completely correct. At that time, a major issue was to establish the seriousness of design, eliminate the reckless methods of those who did not understand, and establish an atmosphere of humbly learning from the Soviet Union. However, it was not made clear at the same time that in implementing Soviet designs and implementing expert suggestions, we should understand the essence of technical documents, and consider and handle problems in light of China's specific conditions. This led to a tendency to learn Soviet technology in a dogmatic manner.
    There are many manifestations of a dogmatic attitude in learning Soviet technology. The most common manifestation is that everything starts from documents, regardless of the actual situation. For example, there is a cloth bag in the car for storing tools. Relevant personnel carefully studied the cloth samples taken from the textile factory according to the Soviet technical documents and said that the cloth was good, but the number of warp and weft threads per square centimeter did not meet the requirements of the technical documents, so it was unqualified. In fact, what is the direct relationship between the number of warp and weft threads and the installation of tools?
    Another manifestation of dogmatism is to regard "correct" and "advanced" as absolute and immutable. It is believed that since Soviet experience is correct and advanced, we only need to follow it, without considering our specific conditions. For example, in early 1954, drawings began to arrive at the factory in large quantities. According to the Soviet national standard for drawing management, we established a central technical document library to manage all production drawings in the factory. However, because the drawings came too quickly, the management work could not keep up, resulting in serious backlog and confusion, until we divided the document library into five, and assigned them to the relevant technical departments, the problem was solved. The document library is the bank of drawings. Whether it is better to manage it centrally or decentrally depends on the flow of drawings and the level of management. When a large number of drawings have been rapidly circulating between various work departments, and the management personnel have not yet learned the business of managing drawings, centralized management is not feasible.
    Some comrades believe that since Soviet technology is advanced, we should not modify it. When they encounter specific technical problems that cannot be solved, they believe that the Soviet Union has not solved this problem either, so they no longer seek a solution. The facts prove that this is not entirely the case. Although the design of the "Liberation" brand car is already very good, automobile design is constantly progressing; moreover, China's specific conditions for automobile use are very different from those of the Soviet Union. If we make a certain degree of modification to the drawings based on a thorough understanding and analysis of the actual situation, so that it is more suitable for our country's conditions of use, then this is by no means disrespecting Soviet experience, but treating it with a serious and responsible attitude.
    It is of course not good to regard Soviet technology as dogma and copy it mechanically, but it is also very harmful to be self-righteous and arbitrarily modify it based on one-sided reasoning, resulting in errors and accidents. We must proceed from reality, understand the spirit and essence of Soviet advanced experience and technology, and apply it flexibly according to China's specific conditions. This requires us to earnestly digest what we have learned.
    Now, the Soviet Union has helped us build the first automobile factory and has helped us start automobile production. In the future, to produce more, faster, better, and more economically, we must continue to work hard to learn from the Soviet Union, and at the same time cultivate a realistic attitude, and use this attitude to learn and work.

    加强学习，发展汽车工业
    第一汽车制造厂副厂长　孟少农
    我国的汽车工业是在落后的工业基础上，依靠苏联的技术援助建立起来的。汽车生产的每一方面对于我们都是新鲜的生疏的。如何去掌握汽车生产，成为生产技术的主人，使苏联供给我们的第一流技术装备服服贴贴地运转，是汽车厂在创办时期要解决的主要问题。要掌握新技术，获得新本领，就必须通过生产准备和生产的实践，并利用其他可能的办法，继续向苏联学习。
    汽车厂全体职工对学习的认识是一致的、劲头是很足的。学习的客观条件也特别好。苏联把汽车生产技术的大门敞开来，让我们得到了只有从兄弟工人阶级那里才能获得的关怀和帮助。
    但是，直到现在，我们还远没有学会掌握汽车生产的全套技术。我们只是学会了把机器开动起来，对于汽车的研究、设计，以及生产的工艺准备，我们或者还未学习，或者只接触过很小的一部分。我们不能长期生产一种类型的汽车，正如一个出版者不能老是印一部书刊一样。如果不能掌握汽车研究设计和生产准备的全面工作，而仅仅有开动机器的本领，那我们是不能前进一步的。
    即使单就开动机器而论，我们也不能说已经学好了。我们的汽车生产还很不稳定，我们还没有熟悉全部机器的性能，事故和错误还比较多，新的技术问题还在陆续出现：我们独立解决问题的能力还很不足。这一切都标志着我们距离完全掌握汽车生产技术的程度还很远。今后必须继续加紧学习，争取在短期内取得独立发展的能力，并且全面地向世界先进水平前进。
    在今后的学习中，学习方法是个极端重要的问题。汽车厂过去的学习方法基本上是正确的，也是有成绩的，但也有缺点。最主要的缺点是教条主义的学习方法，往往抓住苏联先进技术的形式而忽视了实质。
    在汽车厂建设初期，我们就提出了向苏联学习的号召。当时一般人还不了解苏联技术。为了坚定学习的信心，在具体工作中贯彻执行依靠苏联的方针，工厂的党组织曾批判了存在于某些工程技术人员中的崇美思想，强调提出要坚决执行苏联设计和坚决贯彻苏联专家建议。这样做，是完全正确的。当时的一个主要问题是树立设计的严肃性，消除不懂乱来的蛮干办法，和确立虚心向苏联学习的风气。不过，没有同时交代清楚，在执行苏联设计和贯彻专家建议中，应当弄清楚技术文件的实质，应当结合中国具体情况来考虑和处理问题。从而产生了以教条主义的方式学习苏联技术的偏向。
    学习苏联技术的教条主义态度有许多种表现。而最通常的表现是：一切从文件出发，不管实际情况。如汽车上有个布袋，是装随车工具用的。有关人员根据苏联的技术文件，仔细研究从纺织厂拿来的布样后，说布是好布，只是每平方公分中的经纬线数跟技术文件的规定不符，因此不合格。其实经纬线数跟装工具有何直接关系呢？
    教条主义的另一种表现，是把“正确”、“先进”看成是绝对的、永远不变的东西。认为既然苏联经验是正确的，先进的，那么我们只要照办就行，而不考虑我们的具体条件。如在1954年初，图纸开始大量来到工厂。我们根据苏联关于图纸管理的国家标准，建立了一个总管全厂生产图纸的中央技术文件库。但是由于图纸来得太快，管理工作赶不上，发生了严重的积压和混乱，直到我们把文件库分成五个，分别配属到有关技术部门下面，问题才解决。文件库是图纸的银行，它是集中办好还是分散办好，必须看图纸流通情况和管理水平来决定。当大量图纸已迅速在各工作部门间流通起来，而管理人员还没有学会管理图纸的业务时，集中来管是不行的。
    有的同志认为既然苏联的技术是先进的，我们就不应该修改它，碰到了具体技术问题解决不了，就认为苏联这个问题也没有解决，于是也不再去寻求解决的途径。事实证明并不完全如此。虽然“解放牌”汽车的设计已经很好，但是汽车设计是不断进步的；何况中国与苏联的汽车具体使用条件有很多不相同的地方。如果我们根据对实际情况的周密了解和分析，对图纸作一定程度的修改，使它更适合于我国的使用条件，那么，这决不是不尊重苏联经验，而正是以郑重负责的态度对待它。
    把苏联技术当作教条，依样画葫芦地搬用，当然不好，而自以为是，根据片面的道理就擅自修改，以致造成错误和事故，危害也很大。必须从实际出发，领会苏联先进经验和技术的精神实质，按照中国的具体情况灵活地加以运用，这就要求我们必须认真地消化所学来的东西。
    现在，苏联已经帮助我们建成了第一座汽车厂，并且帮助我们开始了汽车生产。今后要更多、更快、更好、更省地生产汽车，我们就必须继续努力学习苏联，同时培养出实事求是的作风，用这种作风来学习和工作。
