    (Our newspaper reports) More than 100,000 workers, students, government employees, and citizens of Beijing held a demonstration parade yesterday to protest the British and French armed aggression against Egypt and to support the just struggle of the Egyptian people. Crowds of marchers shouted angrily in the streets: "British and French aggressor troops get out of Egypt!"

    More than 800 faculty and students from the Beijing Foreign Trade Institute came to the British Chargé d'Affaires office around ten o'clock in the morning. They waved flags and shouted slogans with indignation: "Protest against British and French aggression against Egypt!"
    "Immediately stop the war of aggression against Egypt!"
    "Peaceful settlement of the Suez Canal issue!"
    They posted many slogans in Chinese and English on the walls.
    They said that on the evening of the 1st, when they heard on the radio that Britain and France had launched an armed aggression against Egypt, they were extremely angry. It was already past ten o'clock, but everyone still held an all-school faculty and student meeting. At the meeting, many professors and students spoke in support of Egypt and decided to march.

    The British Chargé d'Affaires office kept its doors tightly closed, leaving only a small door for one person to pass through. A British person secretly watched from the roof for a while, then quietly went down.

    The students marched into the Chargé d'Affaires office with confidence and handed over a letter of protest, which the Chargé d'Affaires promised to forward to the British government.

    More than 900 students from Beijing No. 65 Middle School held many large banners and many cartoons. Li Juehan, a student representative from the school, met the British Chargé d'Affaires, O'Nianru, and warned him: "Listen to the voice of the Chinese people! If Britain and France continue to invade Egypt, the Chinese people will oppose them even more strongly!"

    More than 5,000 faculty and students from Beijing Normal University carried a protest letter the size of a table, which read: "...We solemnly warn you—British and French imperialists must immediately stop this sinful activity, otherwise, you will be consumed by your own fire." They hung this protest letter on the door of the Chargé d'Affaires office.

    More and more marchers were coming, and the door, walls, and chimney of the Chargé d'Affaires office were covered with slogans.

    Workers from the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant sent more than 200 representatives from dozens of miles away. They said that the workers were filled with anger at the employees' meeting on the evening of the 1st, and many workers and engineers proposed to step up production to support Egypt.

    Thousands of construction workers, countless cadres, and commercial staff also came to demonstrate with red flags. Many people threw flags with slogans into the courtyard of the Chargé d'Affaires office.

    A British person poked his head out of the small door of the Chargé d'Affaires office, and when he saw the endless stream of marchers coming like a tide, he quickly shrank back, standing dejectedly inside the door.

    Someone placed a loudspeaker at the door of the Chargé d'Affaires office, and everyone shouted slogans loudly at it.

    Letters of protest were sent into the Chargé d'Affaires office one after another, and some people were not satisfied with just sending them in; they also wanted to read them to the British people in the Chargé d'Affaires office.

    The flow of protesters turned into a flow of supporters. The flow of people poured into the Egyptian Embassy in China. For months, the Chinese people have been closely watching the struggle of the Egyptian people, cheering for the victory of the Egyptian people and indignant at the aggression of imperialism. Today, the people of Beijing, angered by the barbarous behavior of Britain and France, rushed here to pour out their enthusiasm to the representatives of the Egyptian people and convey it to all the Egyptian people.

    The Egyptian Embassy is a quiet residence. Usually, only the whispers of the breeze and the laughter of children break the tranquility of the courtyard. Today, tens of thousands of people suddenly flowed through with colorful flags and cheers.

    The first to arrive here were 1,800 students and 160 faculty members from Beijing No. 26 Middle School. The Egyptian Ambassador to China, Ragheb, personally received their representatives in the reception room.

    Outside the window, Beijing's young students were enthusiastically cheering for the Egyptian people. Inside the room, the sincere friendship between the Chinese and Egyptian people was overflowing. Teachers and student representatives from No. 26 Middle School read letters of support for the Egyptian people. Egyptian Ambassador Ragheb shook their hands tightly, repeatedly saying: "Thank you very much for the support of the Chinese people." He said that he had received many friendly letters from the Chinese people and seen many friendly expressions from the Chinese people, which moved him deeply. He thanked the Chinese people in the name of the Egyptian people. He said that the Egyptian people were prepared to fight to the end. They have the support of the people of the world, and victory will surely belong to them.

    Before the representatives from No. 26 Middle School had time to leave the reception room, Song Xiao, Secretary-General of the Chinese Cultural and Art Delegation who had been to Egypt, and ten members of the delegation arrived. Among them were Han Kesi, an 18-year-old Uygur female singer, and Zohara, a Tatar dancer. They had lived in Egypt for fifty days and were filled with deep feelings for the beautiful Egyptian land and the heroic people. The struggle of Egypt particularly attracted their attention, and they came to the embassy today to express their sentiments.

    Ambassador Ragheb also said with emotion: "The Chinese people, from every stratum of society, support Egypt in this way, which is truly grateful." He said: "Every country will have a dark period in its history. Egypt is now at this critical moment. I believe this period will pass quickly, and the sun of victory will surely burst out of the dark clouds."

    More and more students are coming. The ambassador walked from the room to the platform and waved to the students. A group of female students from No. 27 Middle School crowded to the front of the platform. Twelve or thirteen-year-old girls, with red and green hair ties braided into pigtails, and red scarves tied around their chests. What innocent and eager faces, what bright and pure eyes, what bright and crisp voices! These young, boiling hearts are filled with anger at the colonialists and sympathy for the Egyptian people. At this moment, they are all looking up to the messenger of the Egyptian people. Ambassador Ragheb's eyes also seemed to be moist. He said kindly: "Dear Chinese young women, in the name of the Egyptian people, Egyptian young women, and Egyptian mothers, I pay my respects to you. Egypt will eventually be victorious. The aggressor troops will absolutely not be able to occupy Egypt, nor will they be able to occupy the Suez Canal."

    More than 1,500 white caps shone in the bright sunlight. This is the team from the China Islamic Institute and the Hui Nationality College. "Salaam" (Arabic for hello), they greeted the Egyptian Ambassador in unison. They brought the hearts of China's 12 million Muslims: resolutely oppose the evil actions of the British and French aggressors, spare no sacrifice, and support Egypt's struggle.

    The Egyptian Ambassador has now ascended to the highest platform.

    "Long Live Egypt!" (Arabic) Where did these Arabic slogans come from? Under the red flag of Peking University came students and professors from the Department of Eastern Languages and the Department of Western Languages of Peking University. They shouted Arabic slogans, paying tribute to the Egyptian people they loved.

    No. 11 Middle School, No. 49 Middle School, Girls' No. 13 Middle School... How many young students are coming to this small but extraordinarily intimate land! Listen to their sincere voices to the Egyptian people: "Your pain is our pain. Your brothers and sisters in distress, the Chinese people will never allow the imperialists to trample on Egypt again." "In the days when you are all rising up to defend your motherland with your lives and blood, 600 million Chinese people will always be with you."

    Hospital doctors and nurses came, store employees, textile workers, machine manufacturing workers, steel workers, printing workers, railway workers, transport workers... all came. They had just come from the wards, just left the lathes and blast furnaces, carrying the smell of machine oil, carrying the smell of ink. They came from dozens of miles outside the city, by train and by car. With the unique composure and determination of the working class, holding flags and carrying banners, teams of them poured in like a tide. "We, like the workers of the whole country, will always be the most reliable friends of the Egyptian people." "Please believe us, the steel workers of the capital fully support the just struggle of the Egyptian people!"

    Opposite the Egyptian Embassy is the kindergarten of the Ministry of Foreign Trade. The children there watched with innocent eyes, surprised to see so many uncles and aunts walking back and forth. They also stretched out their small hands and shouted: "Defend peace," "Oppose the British bad guys!" At this time, a four-year-old girl came out of the Egyptian Embassy. She was the daughter of the Egyptian Chargé d'Affaires. She slowly walked to the side of the Chinese children and sat with them. They smiled together, raised their little hands and cheered to the marching队伍 and cheered to the Egyptian Embassy personnel standing on the balcony along with the 队伍. Their faces were carefree, innocent and pure, and their joyful eyes seemed to say: "A happy future must belong to us!"

    It was already dark, but the crowds protesting in front of the British Chargé d'Affaires office were still as crowded as in the daytime.

    首都十万人民游行示威抗议英法侵略埃及
    本报讯　北京市十万多工人、学生、机关干部和市民昨天举行了示威游行，抗议英法武装侵略埃及、支援埃及人民的正义斗争。成群的队伍在街上愤怒地高呼：“英法侵略军从埃及滚回去！”
    北京对外贸易学院八百多师生上午十点多来到英国驻华代办处的门前。他们激愤地摇着旗子喊着口号：“抗议英、法侵略埃及！”
    “立即停止侵略埃及的战争！”
    “和平解决苏伊士运河问题！”
    他们在墙上贴了许多中文的、英文的标语。
    他们说，1日晚上大伙听广播说，英法武装侵略埃及，都气得不得了。已经十点多了，大家还开了个全校师生大会，会上许多教授和学生都发言支持埃及，并且决定游行。
    英国代办处把门关得紧紧的，只留一个能容一个人出入的小门。一个英国人在屋顶上偷偷地看了一会，又悄悄地下去了。
    学生们理直气壮地走进代办处，递了一封抗议书，代办处答应转给英国政府。
    北京第六十五中学九百多学生手里除拿着许多大幅标语外，手里还举着不少漫画。这个学校的学生代表李厥函见到英国代办欧念儒，警告他说：“你听听中国人民的声音吧！如果英法再继续侵略埃及，中国人民就将更加强烈地反对！”
    北京师范大学五千多师生抬着一个像桌子大小的抗议书，上面写着：“……我们严正地警告你们——英法帝国主义者必须立即停止这一罪恶活动，否则必将玩火自焚。”他们把这份抗议书挂在代办处的门口。
    游行的队伍越来越多，代办处的大门上、围墙上、烟囱上贴的写的都是标语。
    石景山钢铁厂工人派了二百多名代表从几十里外的地方赶来。他们说1日晚上的职工大会上职工情绪激愤，许多工人和工程师提出加紧生产支援埃及。
    几千建筑工人，数不清的干部和商业工作人员，也打着红旗来示威。很多人把写满标语口号的旗子扔到代办处的庭院里。
    一个英国人从代办处的小门里探出头来，当他看到望不见头的游行队伍像潮水一样地涌来，就又赶紧缩回头去，无精打彩地站在门里。
    不知谁在代办处门口放了个播音器，大家就对着它高声地喊口号。
    抗议书一封一封地送进代办处，有的人送进去还不甘心，还要对着代办处的英国人念。
    抗议的人流转向声援的人流。人流拥向埃及驻华大使馆。几个月来，中国人民关切地注视着埃及人民的斗争；为埃及人民的胜利欢呼，为帝国主义的侵略愤慨。今天，被英法两国野蛮行为激怒了的北京人民，赶到这里，要把满腔热情，倾吐给埃及人民的代表，转达给全体埃及人民。
    埃及大使馆是一所幽静的院宅。平时，这里只有轻风的微语伴着儿童的欢笑打破庭院的寂静。今天，骤然流过几万人的彩旗和欢呼。
    最先来到这里的是北京市二十六中的一千八百学生和一百六十位教职员。埃及驻华大使拉加布在会客室里亲自接见了他们的代表。
    窗外，喧腾着北京青年学生们向埃及人民的热情的欢呼。室内，洋溢着中国和埃及人民真挚的友谊。二十六中的教员和学生代表念着声援埃及人民的书信。埃及大使拉加布紧紧握着他们的手，连连说：“非常感谢中国人民的支援。”他说他收到中国人民很多友好的来信，看到中国人民很多友好的表示，心中十分感动。他以埃及人民的名义感谢中国人民。他说埃及人民准备斗争到底。他们得到世界人民的支持，胜利一定属于埃及。
    当二十六中的代表还没有来得及退出会客室的时候，曾经到过埃及的中国文化艺术代表团秘书长宋肖和十位团员来了。这里有十八岁的维吾尔族女歌手韩克斯，有塔塔尔族的舞蹈家左哈拉。他们曾经在埃及的国土上住了五十天，对美丽的埃及国土和英勇的人民充满了深厚的感情。埃及的斗争特别吸引着他们的注意，他们今天特地到大使馆来表示他们的情意。
    拉加布大使也充满着感情说：“中国无论那一阶层人民都对埃及这样支持，真觉得十分感激。”他说：“每个国家历史上都会有一个黑暗的时期。埃及现在就正处于这严重的时刻。相信这个时期很快会过去，胜利的太阳一定会从乌云中冲出来。”
    学生们愈来愈多。大使从室内走到平台上，向着学生挥手致意。二十七中的一群女学生拥到平台前面。十二三岁的女孩子，红绿头绳结着发辫，红领巾系在胸前。多么天真热切的脸，多么明亮单纯的眼睛，多么明亮清脆的声音！这些年青沸腾的心胸充满了对殖民主义者的愤怒和对于埃及人民的同情。她们此时都仰望着埃及人民的使者。拉加布大使的眼睛也似乎润湿起来。他亲切地说：“亲爱的中国女青年们，我以埃及人民，埃及女青年、埃及母亲的名义向你们致以敬意。埃及最后终会胜利的。侵略军绝对进占不了埃及，也绝对不能占领苏伊士运河。”
    一千五百多顶圆白帽闪耀在灿烂的阳光下面。这是中国伊斯兰教经学院和回民学院的队伍。“色俩目”，（阿拉伯语你好），他们齐声向埃及大使问候。他们带来中国一千二百万穆斯林的心意：坚决反对英法侵略者的罪恶行动，不惜任何牺牲，支援埃及的斗争。
    埃及大使此刻已经登临最高的一层洋台。
    “阿尔息脱密斯”（阿拉伯语：埃及万岁）这些阿拉伯语的口号声从那里传来？在北京大学的红旗下面来了北京东语系和西语系的学生和教授。他们喊着阿拉伯文的口号，向着他们热爱的埃及人民致敬。
    十一中、四十九中、女十三中……多少青年学生在向着这块小小的但是却又感觉异常亲密的土地上来呵！请听听他们对埃及人民这样真挚的声音：“你们的痛苦就是我们的痛苦。你们共患难的兄弟，中国人民决不允许帝国主义者重新践踏埃及”、“在你们全民奋起以生命和鲜血保卫祖国的日子里，六亿中国人民永远和你们在一起。”
    医院的医生、护士来了，店员工人、纺织工人、机器制造工人、钢铁工人、印刷工人、铁路工人、运输工人……都来了。他们刚从病房走来，刚离开车床和高炉，带着机器油的气味，带着油墨的气味走来了。他们从郊外几十里的地方，坐着火车、坐着汽车赶到这里。他们以工人阶级特有的沉着与决心，拿着旗子，抬着标语，一队队像潮水一样不停的涌进来。“我们和全国工人一样，永远是埃及人民最可靠的朋友”，“请相信我们，首都的钢铁工人全力支持埃及人民的正义斗争！”
    在埃及大使馆对面，是中国对外贸易部的幼儿园。那里的孩子们张着天真的眼睛惊奇地看着这么多叔叔、阿姨走来走去。他们也伸出小手，喊着：“保卫和平”、“反对英国坏人”！这时候，埃及大使馆走出来一位四岁的小姑娘，她是埃及代办的女儿。她慢慢走到中国孩子的身边，和他们并坐在一起。他们一起微笑着，举起小手向行进中的队伍欢呼，和着队伍一起向站在阳台上的埃及大使馆的人员欢呼。他们的脸上无忧无虑，天真无邪，那欢愉的眼光仿佛在说：“幸福的将来一定属于我们！”
    天已经黑尽了，可是在英国代办处门口抗议的人群还像白天一样拥挤。
