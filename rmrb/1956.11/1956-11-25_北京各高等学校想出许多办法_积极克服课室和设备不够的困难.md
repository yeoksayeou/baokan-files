Xinhua News Agency, 24th: Beijing's universities have devised many methods to overcome the difficulties of insufficient housing and equipment.

    Beijing University's Russian Language Building classroom 116 is used for classes from 7:15 AM to 6:05 PM. For example, on the 19th, second-year students from the Chemistry Department had class first, followed by Russian graduate students. Finally, first-year students from the Mathematics and Mechanics Department came to attend a mathematics analysis problem session. More than ninety classrooms in the whole school are like this, and they are only empty when all the teachers and students are resting.

    In the past, Beijing University held classes at a unified time. Since the autumn of this year, the number of students has increased by more than 2,000, and classrooms, laboratories, libraries, and reading rooms are insufficient. It is not possible to build new ones for the time being. The school has adopted a two-shift system, with science and liberal arts students attending classes in the morning and afternoon respectively, which has completely solved the difficulty of insufficient study rooms. The drilling research section of the Beijing Institute of Geology needed to equip eleven machines and other tools this autumn, including deep oil well drilling rigs, core drilling rigs, and motorized percussion drills. Many of these machines cannot be manufactured domestically. If they were to be purchased from abroad, it would cost 2.2 million yuan. Later, the school's teachers, draftsmen, technicians, and others worked together to study the use of iron models instead, which only cost 80,000 yuan. Teachers from Beijing University, Beijing Agricultural University, and Beijing Normal University also used this method to make many instruments and teaching aids, which saved funds and met the needs of teaching.

    The reading room of Beijing Normal University was not big enough, so the library staff came up with a way to use the large dining hall. After the students finished dinner, the cooks quickly wiped the tables clean and laid tablecloths. In less than half an hour, the reference books needed by the students were placed there.

    北京各高等学校想出许多办法
    积极克服课室和设备不够的困难
    新华社24日讯　北京各高等学校想出许多办法克服房屋和仪器设备不足的困难。
    北京大学俄文楼一百一十六教室，从早晨七点一刻到下午六点零五分，都被利用来上课。例如在19日，首先是化学系二年级的学生上课，接着俄文研究生来上课。一直到最后，数学力学系一年级学生来上了数学分析习题课。全校有九十多个教室都是这样，只有当教师和学生全部休息的时候，教室才空闲下来。
    北京大学以往是在统一的时间里上课的，今年秋季以来，学生增加了两千多人，教室、实验室和图书馆、阅览室都不够用，一时又不能增建。学校就采取二部制，理科和文科的学生分别在上午、下午上课，这样就全部解决了学习室不足的困难。北京地质学院钻探教研室今年秋季需要置备石油深井钻、岩心钻机、机动冲击钻等十一台机械和其他工具，其中许多机械国内还不能制造，如果到国外去买就要花二百二十万元。后来学校教师和绘图员、技工等一起，研究用铁制作模型来代替，结果只需要花八万元。北京大学、北京农业大学、北京师范大学的教师们也采用这个办法分别做成了许多仪器和教学用具，既节约了资金又满足了教学的需要。
    北京师范大学阅览室不够用，图书馆工作人员就想出办法利用大饭厅。学生们吃罢晚饭，炊事员就迅速地擦净桌面，铺上桌布。不到半小时，学生需要的参考书就摆出来了。
