Title: The Radiance of Language

    The "If the Master Does Not Speak, What Will We Disciples Transmit..." published in the People's Daily on August 20th is an article against dogmatism, calling for each person to have their own thoughts, their own language... to develop each person's own independent thinking ability. This was originally so good, but unfortunately, the author satirized an ancient person who precisely had their own thoughts, saying "Zigong's demeanor here is particularly laughable," as if Zigong was inherently laughable, but here, even more ridiculously so.
    I am not clear about Zigong's other achievements, and I don't want to say anything; what is undeniable is that Zigong also precisely had his own language, possessing the virtue of "establishing words." We will cite only one example. "What I do not wish others to do to me, I also do not wish to do to others," meaning the same as Confucius's saying, "Do not impose on others what you yourself do not desire." If one does not possess the highest character and wisdom, one cannot emit this radiance of language. And Confucius's saying, just like some other words of Confucius, was said in response to Zigong's questioning, possibly not having been clearly thought of before. Thus, Zigong is at least a conversationalist rich in suggestive and evocative power, someone to whom one can confide... Zigong was a loyal disciple of Confucius, and Confucius cherished him; "Those who followed me between Chen and Cai are no longer at my door (the disciples who followed me when I was besieged between Chen and Cai are no longer among my followers)..." Confucius cherished them, and Zigong was among them. Everyone knows that Confucius greatly valued poetry and music, and precisely in this regard, the praise Confucius bestowed upon Zigong was intimate: "Ci (Zigong's given name was Ci) can now be spoken to about poetry," meaning that one could discuss poetry with Ci because "he who is told about the past knows the future"...
    I believe that when Confucius said "I desire to not speak" (I want to stop talking), he was only lamenting that his ideals could not be realized, not opposing some kind of dogmatism. People sometimes sigh, and it is not always opposing something. Here, I do not see Confucius definitively opposing anything, I only hear him lamenting. - Confucius lamented, saying I want to stop talking, but at least he still wanted to talk to his disciples, perhaps even precisely because of a desire to speak. People cannot not speak: "I desire to not speak" is not another statement? Zigong's saying "If the Master does not speak, what will we disciples transmit?" is precisely the most appropriate, comforting the teacher and making Confucius feel, even in loneliness, that at least his disciples always understood and respected him. Zigong spoke precisely in the best way, just like another time, when Confucius said, "No one understands me!" Zigong appropriately said, "How can it be said that no one understands the Master?"
    It is precisely the disciple's duty to "transmit" (expound, promote) the teacher's "words" (statements, doctrines, insights, even idle talk). The question is whether the teacher's "words" are correct, and whether the correct "words" are faithfully promoted. And faithfulness is also creation, also independence. Independence is not relying on nothing, but precisely relying on the support of many external forces.
    The attainment of independent thinking ability must absorb all kinds of influences, just like an ocean, absorbing groundwater, and also absorbing clouds in the sky...

    语言的光辉
  　李又然
    人民日报8月20日发表的“子如不言，则小子何述焉……”是一篇反对教条主义，要求各人有自己的思想、自己的语言……发挥各人自己的独立思考能力的文章。这本来多么好，不幸作者讽刺了一位正是有自己的思想的古人，说“子贡在这里的神态，特别令人发笑”，好像子贡本来就是可笑的，不过在这里，更可笑得厉害罢了。
    我不清楚子贡另外方面的功绩，不想说什么；无可争辩的是子贡又正是有自己的语言的，有
  “立言”的美德的。我们只举一个例。“我不欲人之加诸我也，吾亦无欲加诸人”，意思跟孔子说的“己所不欲，勿施于人”一样。假如没有最高的品格和智慧就发不出这种语言的光辉。而孔子的这句话，正像孔子别的一些话一样是在答子贡问的时候说出来的，可能本来还没有明确地想到过。这样，子贡又至少是一个富于暗示和诱发的力量的对谈者，可以谈心的……子贡是孔子的忠实的弟子，孔子怀念他；“从我于陈蔡者皆不及门也（跟随我在陈蔡之间被困的弟子们都不在我的门下了）……”孔子怀念他们，他们之中就有子贡。大家知道孔子非常重视诗歌和音乐，刚好在这一方面，孔子赋予子贡的赞美是亲切的：“赐也（子贡名字叫赐）始可与言诗已矣”，意思是说可以同赐谈诗了，因为“告诸往而知来者”——告诉他过去他就知道未来……
    我认为孔子说“予欲无言”（我要不再讲话了），只是叹息自己的理想不能实现，不是在反对什么教条主义。人有时候叹叹气，不是什么时候都反对什么的。在这里，我看不出孔子在确定地反对什么，我只听见他在感叹着。——孔子感叹着，说我要不再讲话了，至少还是想同弟子们谈谈的，甚至正因为渴望讲话的原故也可能。人是不能不讲话的：“予欲无言”不是又讲了一句话吗？子贡说“子如不言，则小子何述焉”（要是夫子不再讲话了，那我们做弟子的拿什么传给后代呢！）正是讲得最得体，是安慰了先生，使孔子在寂寞中也感到至少自己的弟子们是始终了解自己尊重自己的。子贡正是说得最好的，就像另一次，孔子说“莫我知也夫”（没有人了解我！）的时候，子贡说“何为其莫知子也”（怎末能说没有人了解夫子呢？）一样恰当。
    弟子要“述”（阐发、宣扬）先生的“言”（言论、学说、见解，以至闲谈），这正是弟子的天职。问题是先生的“言”是不是正确的，正确的“言”是不是忠实地宣扬了。而忠实也是创造，也是独立。独立不是什么都不倚靠，正是要倚靠许许多多外力支持的。
    独立思考能力的获得必须吸取各种各样的影响，就像一个海，吸取地下水，也吸取空中云采……
