    上海一批私方人员
    参加专业公司领导工作
    据新华社讯　新近被任命为上海市一百零七个专业公司经理、副经理的一百八十九名公私合营企业的私方人员，大部分在上星期内到职。上海市第一重工业局、第一轻工业局和第一商业局等专业局都举行了欢迎会，介绍他们和所属各公司原有的领导人员见面。许多专业公司特地举行经理、科长联席会议，向他们介绍工作情况；有的公司还举行干部大会，欢迎他们就职。
    已到职的私方人员，大多按照各人的专长作了分工，并且立即开始工作。这些私方人员在参加领导工作后，情绪很高。有些人已经作出了成绩。例如新任第二重工业局螺丝工业公司副经理的沈再昌、纺织工业局印染工业公司新任副经理舒昭圣等。
    有些专业公司原有的领导干部已经同新任领导工作的私方人员在一起制定了办公制度，以便共同进行工作。
