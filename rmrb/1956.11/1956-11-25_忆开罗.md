    Remembering Cairo
    Huang Wu

    The sound of cannons in Port Said has awakened many memories in me. These days, the image of Cairo has been floating in my mind.

    Eleven years ago, when the tall Iranian date trees were lush with green leaves, I arrived in Cairo on the Nile. I loved that ancient city.

    For a first-time visitor, the majesty of the pyramids, the mystery of the Sphinx, and even the light songs and dances of the "Ambassador" ballroom, and the luxury of the "Shepherd" Hotel, would all leave a deep impression. But I liked the people of Cairo even more. Whenever I think of that city, I seem to see the people I knew there again, their voices, faces, and smiles. It was they who gave Cairo its beautiful soul, and made me forever cherish deep feelings for it.

    When the plane took me over those famous cities from "Arabian Nights" and the "Old and New Testaments" and arrived in Cairo, it was already midnight. The day was about the fourteenth or fifteenth of the lunar month, and the moon outside the hotel was as round as a mirror. It is said that watching the moon rise in the desert is one of Cairo's wonders. But I was in no mood to appreciate that clear moonlight. My ears started to ache again. During the long flight, every time the plane landed, my ears would always hurt for a while. But that night it hurt extraordinarily, as if my head was about to split open. The hotel staff sent me to a clinic, and I was already somewhat dizzy. I only remember a bright light shining on my face, followed by a stream of cold water injected into my ear canal....

    When I woke up, I found myself lying on the operating table. Two smiling, large, and bright eyes were staring at me.

      "My Chinese friend, does your ear still hurt?"

    The speaker was a female doctor. Her hair was already graying. A kind and amiable face, exuding benevolence within its beauty. And those eyes were even warmer than the winter sun.

    My ear really didn't hurt anymore. Anyone who has been rescued from extreme pain will naturally feel the way I felt then towards the rescuer. I really wanted to kiss her graying hair to express my gratitude.

      "I am sincerely grateful to you." I noticed that half of her hair was a little disheveled, obviously she had been called up from sleep. "I'm very sorry to bother you at such a late hour."

      "It is my duty. The greatest joy of a doctor is to cure their patients' illnesses. And I feel especially honored to serve a Chinese friend."

    "How did you determine that I am Chinese?"

    She smiled and pointed to my feet. "A Chinese friend of my father once gave him a pair of Chinese shoes, just like the ones you are wearing."

    It turned out that the pair of black cloth shoes that I had changed into at the hotel had revealed my nationality.

    "In another quarter of an hour," she looked at her watch, "your ear will be completely healed. Yesterday afternoon, a Soviet naval officer also came here because of ear pain, and I cured him in ten minutes. Guess what he said to me when he left? He said that he no longer had to worry about not being able to properly enjoy Egyptian music. What an interesting young man! Do you like our music?"

    "Otherwise, I wouldn't have come. After arriving in Cairo, the first thing I did was rush to treat my ear."

    "Oh dear, that's terrible! You came to such a place, and saw such an old woman like me first thing after you arrived in Cairo. We must think of a way to remedy this. Otherwise, the impression of Cairo that you take away will be simply terrible!"

    She laughed very happily and very kindly. I suddenly felt that the small room was not in a foreign land far beyond the oceans, but in my own home by the Yangtze River; the person facing me was not an unfamiliar foreign female doctor, but one of my own elder sisters. Any distance between us did not exist.

    She looked at her watch again. "Now I'll send you back to the hotel." Perhaps she saw my hesitation, so she continued, "It's not far, only a quarter of an hour's walk. And I also want to visit a patient along the way."

    When she returned to the small room, she was carrying a lined overcoat and diligently draped it over me, saying, "It can get very cold here at night."

    Outside, the clear moonlight poured like crystal onto the boundless desert. Apart from a few unknown insect sounds, there was silence. Occasionally, a gust of wind passed, and the cold air whistled. On the way, she asked about China's War of Resistance Against Japan, and was particularly concerned about medical care for the wounded soldiers. She told me that her father had always been in business in England. She had studied in England from a young age, and later became a doctor. In order to serve her own people, she returned to Egypt. She had been practicing medicine in Cairo for twenty years. I asked her how many children she had. She said, "So many that it's hard to count. I treat all my young patients as my own children."

    At the hotel entrance, when we said good night to each other, she repeatedly told me to see more of Cairo and listen to more Egyptian music.

    I asked an Egyptian friend who was a journalist to take me to listen to music, and he took me to an Egyptian tavern. He said that the best music was in the taverns, and that taverns represented Egypt better than the pyramids. Only here could you see the temperament and humor of us Egyptians. After a day of hard work, people come to the tavern in the evening to sit and relax for an hour or two. They definitely don't come here to pretend.

    On a small street by the Nile, going in through a narrow doorway and turning two corners, you would enter a suddenly spacious hall. At the back of the hall was a stage, and a girl wearing a transparent veil was dancing to the lingering music. The dance was somewhat similar to the Hawaiian hula, but the swaying of her body was even more captivating. The hall was crowded with people, wearing Turkish hats or turbans, dressed in robes or suits, sitting around all kinds of tables. Some were talking loudly, some were whispering; some had brought their wives or lovers, and some had even brought their children. You could hear the clinking of glasses and the "popping" sound of opening wine bottles. Along with the shouts of tapping on the table to call the waiter, you would see white-clad waiters, carrying large trays (with wine bottles and glasses piled up like pagodas), swimming like fish through the crowd.

    Suddenly, a wine glass was smashed on the floor. The crisp sound made almost everyone turn their heads, and even the dancing girl was slightly startled. A British officer with a small mustache stood up from his seat, swaying, and shouted at the top of his voice:

    "Wine, more wine! Are you afraid I won't pay? I have plenty of money!" His tongue was already stiff, and his eyes were wide and grotesque.

    A child burst into tears. Someone hissed, and more people shouted "Sit down, don't block our view."

    The small mustache's face turned even redder, and he threateningly held up a finger. "You poor wretches, be careful, one day I'll slaughter you all." He slumped back into his seat.

    "Throw him out!" someone roared. "Kick him out!" others echoed.

    The small mustache looked around blankly, wanting to say something, but under the anger of the crowd, his face turned white. He hurriedly grabbed his military cap and staggered out. As soon as the door closed, laughter erupted in the hall, very happy laughter.

    My friend and I talked about the British and the Allied forces in Cairo.

    "How do they view us? You can understand it from the traveler's notice written in large letters at the military airport. One item is that the women here have venereal diseases. The other is be careful, there are pickpockets here. They treat us like poor wretches. We, on the other hand, treat them like lice."

    "We also have lice there," I said.

    "Chiang Kai-shek is also one. During the Cairo Conference, our newspapers published several of his photos. I called his photo with Roosevelt 'Master and Servant Picture,' because although they were sitting side by side, the relationship of master and servant was obvious at a glance. I called his photo with Churchill 'Two Lice Picture,' I thought, comparing them to those blood-sucking little animals couldn't be more appropriate."

    As we left the tavern, he said thoughtfully to me, "The Egyptians have long recognized those lice, it seems that the time for a major cleaning and sanitation campaign is not far away."

    Eleven years have passed, many things have been forgotten, and many impressions have faded. But the words and deeds of that female doctor and that journalist, as well as that lively scene in the tavern, are still vivid in my mind.

    In the past eleven years, both of our countries have carried out cleaning and sanitation campaigns. We have eliminated the lice. Egypt is the same. For the health of the Egyptian people, you two must have put in a lot of effort and worked hard enough. You, Doctor Comrade, may already have a full head of white hair; and you, Journalist Friend, I'm afraid you have also added a few more wrinkles on your forehead.

    Today, when the flames of aggression are turning the Suez Canal red, when the Nile River is surging with angry waves, how can I not miss you? I can imagine that you, Doctor Comrade, must be in a field hospital, performing surgery on wounded soldiers. You were so concerned about a stranger's earache, how heartbroken must you be when you see your own children being bombed into a bloody mess! And you, Journalist Friend, you must also be in the trenches at the front, or somewhere else, rushing to write articles that boost morale and inspire people. Write it, draw out the original shapes of those dirty and ugly lice, so that people all over the world hate them. Friends, your sacred work is not only for the Egyptian people, but also for human dignity and honor. We are equally grateful to you. We have already made a guarantee to fully support you.

    At this moment, of course, I will not forget the small mustache, that fellow who took it as his duty to slaughter the Egyptian people. It is very likely that he has reappeared somewhere in Port Said, adding a new entry to the countless blood debts he has already incurred. But if the Egyptian people already knew how to throw him out of the tavern eleven years ago; then today, they will know even better how to drive him out of the desert.

    To deal with lice, you actually only need fingernails. (Attached picture)

    忆开罗
    荒芜
    塞得港的炮声唤起了我的许多回忆。这些天来，我的脑子里一直浮动着开罗的影子。
    十一年前，正当高大的伊朗枣树绿叶成荫的时候，我到了尼罗河上的开罗。我欢喜那个古老的城市。
    对于一个初访者，金字塔的雄伟，人面兽的神秘，乃至“大使”舞厅的轻歌曼舞，“牧人”饭店的富丽堂皇，都会留下深刻的印象。而我却更欢喜开罗的人。每当我想起那个城市，我就仿佛又看见我在那里所认识的人们，他们的音容笑貌来。正是他们赋予开罗以美丽的灵魂，使我对它永远怀着深挚的感情的。
    飞机带我飞过“天方夜谭”和“新旧约”中那些名城而到达开罗的时候，已经是午夜了。那天大约是阴历的十四、五，宾馆外的月圆如镜。据说，大漠中看月出，是开罗的奇观之一。可是我已无心去欣赏那清朗的月色。我的耳朵又痛了起来。在长程飞行中，每次飞机着陆，我的耳朵总要痛一阵子。但那夜却痛得出奇，好像头都要裂开。宾馆的人把我送入诊所，我已经有些晕迷。我只记得有一道强烈的光照在我的脸上，接着一股冰冷的水注入耳腔……。
    当我醒来时，我发现我躺在手术台上。两只含笑的、大而有光的眼睛正在凝视着我。
      “我的中国朋友，耳朵不痛了吧？”
    说话的是一位女医生。头发已斑白了。一张和蔼可亲的面孔，于美丽中透慈祥。而那两道眼光更像冬天的阳光一样温暖。
    耳朵果然不痛了。凡是从极大的苦痛中被解救出来的人，对于解救者，都会油然产生像我那时所感到的心情的。我真想吻吻她的斑白头发，来表示我的感激。
      “我从心眼里感激你。”我注意到她的半边头发有些蓬松，显然是从睡眠中给叫了起来的。“在这样的深夜里打扰你，我很抱歉。”
      “这是我的责任。一个医生的最大的快慰就是治好他的病人的病。而能为一个中国朋友服务，我特别感到荣幸。”
    “你怎样断定我是中国人的？”
    她笑了，用手指指我的脚。“从前我父亲的一个中国朋友，送过他一双中国鞋，和你穿的一样。”
    原来我在宾馆里换上的一双黑布鞋泄露了国籍的秘密。
    “再过一刻钟，”她看了看手表，“你的耳朵就会完全好了。昨天下午，一个苏联的海军军官，也因为耳朵痛，到这里来过，我十分钟就给他治好了。你猜他临走时对我说什么来着？他说以后再不担心不能好好地欣赏埃及音乐了。多有意思的年青人！你喜欢我们的音乐吗？”
    “要不，我就不来了。我到了开罗之后，第一件事就是跑来治耳朵。”
    “哎呀，实在糟糕！你到了开罗，首先来到的，是这么一个地方，首先看到的，又是我这么一个老太婆。一定得想个补救办法才好。要不然，你带走的对开罗的印象，简直太可怕了！”
    她笑得非常开心，非常亲切。我突然觉得，那间小房并不是远在什么重洋之外的异乡，而是在长江边上的自己家里了；面对着我这个人，也并不是一位素不相识的外国女医生，而是自己的一位大姐姐了。我们之间的任何距离都不存在了。
    她又看了看表。“现在我送你回宾馆。”大约她看出了我踌躇，于是接着说，“不远，只有一刻钟的路。而且我还想顺便去看一个病人。”
    她再回到小屋里的时候，手里提了一件夹大衣，殷勤地替我披在身上，一面说：“在我们这里，夜里可凉得很哩。”
    外面，清莹的月色，像水晶一样泻在无边无尽的沙漠上。除了几声不知名的虫声外，一片静寂。偶尔，一阵风过，冷气飕飕。路上，她问到中国的抗战，对伤兵的医药特别关心。她告诉我，她父亲一向在英国经商。她从小就在英国读书，后来当医生。为了替自己的人民服务，她回到埃及来。她在开罗行医已经有二十年了。我问她有几个孩子。她说：“多得简直难以数计。我的病人，凡是年青的，我都把他们当作自己的孩子看。”
    在宾馆门口，互道晚安时，她一再要我多看看开罗，多听听埃及音乐。
    我让一个当新闻记者的埃及朋友带我去听音乐，他把我带进了一家埃及酒馆。他说，最好的音乐在酒馆里，而酒馆比金字塔更能代表埃及。在这里你才可以看见我们埃及人的性情和风趣。人们劳累了一天之后，晚上，到酒馆里轻松愉快地坐上一两个钟头。他们决不是为了装模做样，才到这里来的。
    在尼罗河畔的一条小街上，从一个窄长的门道进去，转两个弯，便走进了一个豁然开朗的大厅。大厅的后面是舞台，一个披着透明的薄纱的姑娘，正随着那缠绵悱恻的音乐跳舞。那舞姿有些像夏威夷的草裙舞，但那身段的婆娑摇曳却更迷人。大厅中间挤满了人，戴土耳其帽或头巾的，穿着长袍或西服的，围坐在各色各样的桌子前面。有的在高谈阔论，有的在喁喁细语；有些人带了妻子或情人来，有人还带了孩子来。你可以听见碰杯声、开酒瓶的“玻玻”声。随着敲桌子叫侍者的喊声、你会看见白衣侍者们，托着大托盘（那上面的酒瓶、酒杯堆得像座宝塔）鱼儿似的在人丛中游来游去。
    突然，一只酒杯掼在地板上了。那清脆的响声使得几乎所有的人都掉过头去，连那跳舞的姑娘也微微发怔了。一个留着小胡子的英国军官从他的座位上，摇摇晃晃地站了起来，直着喉咙大喊：
    “酒，更多的酒！怕我不付钱么？我有的是钱！”他的舌头已经发直，眼睛睁得怪相。
    一个孩子哇地哭了起来。有人发出嘶声，更多的人喊“坐下，别挡住我们的视线。”
    小胡子的脸更红了，威胁地伸出一个手指头。“穷鬼，当心，有一天我把你们都宰了。”他颓然坐了下去。
    “把他赶出去！”有人怒吼了。“把他摔出去！”四下里回应着。
    小胡子茫然左顾右盼，想说什么，但在众怒之下，他的脸变白了。他慌忙抓起军帽，踉踉跄跄地走了出去。门刚关上，大厅里爆发了笑声，非常愉快的笑声。
    我的朋友和我谈起了英国人，谈起了在开罗的盟军。
    “他们是怎样看待我们的呢？你从军用飞机场上用大字书写的旅客须知上就可以明白。一条是这里的女人有性病。另一条是当心，这里有扒手。他们把我们当作穷鬼。我们呢，我们把他们看作虱子。”
    “我们那里也有虱子，”我说。
    “蒋介石也是一个。开罗会议的时候，我们的报纸上登出了他的几张照片。我把他和罗斯福合照的叫做‘主仆图’，因为他们虽然并排坐着，但那种主奴的关系是一眼就看得出来。我把他和丘吉尔合照的叫做‘二虱图’，我以为，把他们比作那种吸血的小动物，再恰当也没有了。”
    我们离开那家酒馆时，他若有所思地向我说：“埃及人早已认清了那些虱子，看来，进行一次清洁卫生大运动的时候，不会太远了。”
    十一年了，许多事情都忘记了，许多印象都淡薄了。但是那个女医生、那个记者的言谈举止，还有那个酒馆的一幕活剧，历历如在目前。
    十一年来，我们两个国家都进行了清洁卫生运动。我们消灭了虱子。埃及也是一样。为了埃及人民的健康，你们两位一定付出了很多心血，工作得够辛勤的吧。你，医生同志，或许已经满头白发；而你，记者朋友，你的额头上恐怕也多添了几条皱纹吧。
    今天，当侵略的火焰照红了苏伊士运河的时候，当尼罗河涌起愤怒的浪潮的时候，我如何能不怀念你们？我可以想像出来，你，医生同志，一定正在战地医院里，为受伤的将士施行手术。为了一个陌生的外国人的耳痛，你尚且那么关心，当你看见你自己的孩子们炸得血肉模糊，你该如何心痛啊！而你，记者朋友，你也一准正在前线的战壕里，或者别的什么地方，赶写着振奋士气和人心的文章。写吧，把那些肮脏的、丑恶的虱子们的原形画出来，让全世界人民都憎恶它们。朋友，你们的神圣工作，不单是为了埃及人民，也是为了人类尊严和荣誉。我们同样感激你们。我们已经作了保证，以全力支持你们。
    此刻，我当然也不会忘记小胡子，那以宰割埃及人民为职志的家伙。很可能他又出现在塞得港的什么地方，在已经欠下的无数血债中，又添上了新的一笔。但是如果埃及人民早在十一年前就知道怎样把他赶出酒馆；那末今天，他们更会知道怎样把他赶出沙漠的。
    对付虱子，其实只要有手指甲也就行了。（附图片）
