    Hogs Can Be Rapidly Increased

    The supply of pork falling short of demand has become a serious problem.

    How to quickly increase the number of hogs has also become a more pressing issue.

    Can the production of hogs be increased relatively quickly?

    The fact that the number of hogs in Hubei Province increased by nearly double in just over half a year shows that it is not impossible to increase the number of hogs relatively quickly. The problem lies in whether correct and effective measures are taken, and whether those prohibitions that only limit the enthusiasm of pig farmers are resolutely abolished.

    生猪是可能迅速增加的
    猪肉供不应求，已经成了一个严重问题。
    怎样才能使猪的数量很快地增加起来，也就成了更加迫切的问题。
    生猪究竟能不能比较快地增产呢？
    湖北省的猪，在半年多一点的时间里就增加了将近一倍，这个事实就说明了：使生猪的数量比较快地增长起来不是不可能的。问题在于是不是采取了正确的切实有效的措施，是不是坚决地取消了那些只能限制养猪者的积极性的禁令。
