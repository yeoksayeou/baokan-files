Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, 21st - Budapest Radio broadcast a statement from the Hungarian Revolutionary Worker-Peasant Government.

The statement pointed out the major tasks that local councils at all levels and their elected bodies must carry out, and called on worker committees and local councils to cooperate more effectively. The government emphasized that the personnel of these elected bodies, the workers in the food industry and commerce, the staff in social undertakings, and the employees of factories, performed very well in extremely difficult combat times, and they worked selflessly for the interests of the people, even under the threat to their lives. The local councils and executive bodies in cities and villages also performed well in difficult times, and are still working very consciously now.

The Director of the Hungarian National Bank, Sandor Denes, issued a statement to the workers on the 19th, saying that the experience of the last few days has proved that mass panic buying has relatively stabilized. There are no longer long queues in front of food stores, and there is no longer the crowding in front of industrial goods stores as in the past. This is a good phenomenon.

He said, "I believe that if we start working and take appropriate measures, there will be no inflation. We can maintain a balance between purchasing power and commodities, and therefore avoid inflation. At the same time, we should also do so. Otherwise, the workers will suffer the most."

    匈牙利工农革命政府发表声明
    号召工人委员会和地方会议进行更有效的合作
    新华社布达佩斯21日电　布达佩斯电台广播了匈牙利工农革命政府的声明。
    声明指出了各级地方会议和它们所属的选出来的机构必须执行的重大任务，号召工人委员会和地方会议进行更有效的合作。政府强调指出，这些选出来的机构的人员、食品工业和商业的工人们、社会事业中的工作人员们和工厂的职工们，在极端困难的战斗时刻表现得很好，他们为了人民的利益，在生命受到威胁的条件下仍然忘我地工作。城市和乡村的地方会议和执行机构在困难的时刻里也表现得很好，并且现在仍在非常自觉地进行工作。
    匈牙利国家银行行长山陀·德奈斯19日向工人发表声明说，最近几天来的经验证明：群众性的抢购已经比较安定下来了，在食品店门前已经没有排得很长的队伍，在工业用品商店门前也不像往日那样拥挤了，这是好的现象。
    他说，我相信，假若我们开始工作，采取适当的措施，通货膨胀是不会有的。我们能够保持购买力和商品之间的平衡，因此能够避免通货膨胀。同时，我们也应该这样做。否则，工人们将首先受到损失。
