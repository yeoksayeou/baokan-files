Xinhua News Agency Report: Recently, in Beijing's higher institutes of technology and the science departments of comprehensive universities, the phenomenon of excessive study burden for students has reappeared. In some classes at the Beijing Institute of Geology, Beijing Petroleum Institute, Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology, and Beijing Institute of Mining, students' study time is between 65 and 70 hours per week. The situation is even more serious at the Beijing Institute of Technology, where some classes reach more than 90 hours per week, with a school average of around 74 hours.

Currently, excessive study burden is seriously affecting students' health. Students cannot even rest on Sundays. Some students at the Beijing Institute of Technology work on assignments from Saturday evening until 3 a.m., and then continue working until late the next night. At Tsinghua University's Department of Radio Engineering, six students have fallen ill due to "burning the midnight oil."

The main reasons for the excessive study burden are that, since the beginning of the new academic year, some universities have revised their teaching plans, but the course content has not been changed. For example, the calculus course for third-year students in the Mathematics Department of Peking University, which used to be taught over one year, is now completed in half a year, but the content has not been reduced. First-year students in the Department of Engineering Physics at Tsinghua University are required to study many courses simultaneously in one semester, including mathematics, physics, material mechanics, and theoretical mechanics, which is actually beyond their capability. Some teachers give students too much homework and exercises, causing excessive tension in their studies. In the first-year departments of the Beijing Institute of Technology, there are more than 20 math problems per week alone. The lack of self-study guidance from teachers is also an important factor contributing to the excessive study burden. Since Tsinghua University implemented the elective course system, some students have chosen two or three courses that are unrelated or have little relation to their major, which has also increased their workload.

### 北京高等工科院校  出现学生学习负担过重现象

    北京高等工科院校
    出现学生学习负担过重现象
    据新华社讯　在北京高等工科院校和综合大学中的理科各系，近一个月来，又陆续发现了学生学习负担过重的现象。北京地质学院、北京石油学院、北京钢铁工业学院、北京矿业学院等院校的若干班级学生的学习时间，每周都在六十五到七十学时之间。北京工业学院更加严重，有的班级竟达到每周九十多个学时，全校平均也在七十四学时左右。
    目前因学生学习负担过重，已严重地影响了学生的身体健康。学生们在星期日也不能休息。北京工业学院有的学生从星期六晚上赶功课到深夜三点，第二天又一直赶到深夜。清华大学无线电工程系的学生，因“开夜车”学习，病倒了六个人。
    造成学生学习负担过重的主要原因是，新学年以来，有的高等学校虽对教学计划作过修改，但课程内容没有改。北京大学数学系三年级学生所学微积分课程，由一年改为半年学完，内容却未减少。清华大学工程物理系一年级学生在一学期内要同时学习数学、物理、材料力学、理论力学等许多课程，实际上力不胜任。有的学校教师给学生留下过多的作业和习题，造成学生在学习上的过度紧张。北京工业学院一年级各系中仅数学作业，每周就有二十多题。教师对学生缺乏自学指导，也是学生学习负担过重的一个重要因素。清华大学自实行了选课制度后，有的学生选修了两门或三门与本专业无关或关系很少的课程，也增加了他们的忙乱现象。
