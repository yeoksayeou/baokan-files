    Learning From Soviet Experts in a Planned and Organized Way
    Wu Fanwu, Deputy Director of the State Council's Bureau of Foreign Experts

    To transform China from a backward agricultural country into an advanced industrialized one, and to strive to approach the Soviet Union and other major world powers in the scientific and technological levels of some major categories within twelve years, in addition to mobilizing all domestic positive factors and giving full play to the strength of our own experts, we must also hire a group of Soviet experts to help us. The Soviet experts who are currently working in our country have made outstanding contributions to our country's socialist construction, and we should sincerely thank them. However, the best way to express our gratitude is to work hard to learn from them. Premier Zhou Enlai, in his "Report on the Question of Intellectuals," emphatically pointed out the need to learn from Soviet experts. He said: "It is necessary to systematically organize a large number of scientific and technical personnel to learn from the Soviet experts who are now in China, to use them as mentors, and not as ordinary staff. In the construction and production process of the 156 projects aided by the Soviet Union, a large number of technical personnel should be systematically organized to study and master the new technical principles involved, and to disseminate them rapidly."

    Over the past few years, we have learned from Soviet experts and have achieved certain results. However, the results of our learning are not yet satisfactory. The most important shortcoming is that we have not learned from them in a planned and organized way.

    The root cause of this shortcoming lies in two erroneous thoughts. One is the idea that we can hire Soviet experts every year anyway, which has led to a long-term dependence on Soviet experts. Units with this kind of thinking only use experts as ordinary staff. Wherever there is an accident, they send an expert there. They usually don't pay much attention to learning, and when the expert's term is about to expire and they are about to return home, they panic and repeatedly request an extension of their contract. If they cannot keep them, they request that they be rehired. This not only wastes the strength of the Soviet experts, but also hinders the growth of our own strength. Another erroneous concept is to regard learning from Soviet experts in a planned and organized way as something contradictory to and impossible to combine with the completion of current construction and production tasks. In fact, these two are by no means contradictory. Some enterprises involved in Soviet-aided projects, because they did not learn enough from Soviet experts at ordinary times, ended up with accidents in their projects or production that they couldn't solve after the experts returned home. They had no choice but to ask Soviet experts to come to China for guidance again. Isn't this a serious lesson? At present, our country is still a country with very backward science and technology. If we don't seize the time to catch up quickly and make full use of Soviet experts as mentors, it will bring great losses to our work.

    To treat Soviet experts as mentors and learn from them in a planned and organized way, in addition to correcting erroneous thinking, it is also necessary to take some concrete measures. I think:

    First, all units that have hired Soviet experts should designate a number of comrades to learn from the Soviet experts on a regular basis. Of course, everyone has the obligation and the right to learn from Soviet experts; but the reason why we should designate some special personnel is that only by focusing on cultivating a group of specialized talents, using them as the backbone, is it possible to universally improve the scientific and technological level of all staff. The number of apprentices is always limited, otherwise the mentor's energy and time will not be enough.

    When selecting personnel, attention should be paid to selecting those who have similar job duties and more business contacts with the Soviet experts, and who also have certain political conditions and professional levels. The current tendency is to be too strict in selecting political conditions, but the professional level is too far apart, which increases the difficulty of both teaching and learning.

    Once the personnel are selected, their work should not be easily transferred, and some of their social activities should be appropriately reduced to ensure that they have sufficient time to learn from the Soviet experts. In the past, the following things often happened: the personnel who were designated to learn from the Soviet experts were about to be cultivated to maturity under the personal guidance of the Soviet experts, and suddenly they were transferred away, which made the Soviet experts feel very sorry. In addition, some comrades who are designated to learn from Soviet experts are busy attending meetings all day long. When the experts want to talk to them, it is difficult to make an appointment, making it difficult for the Soviet experts to take on the responsibility of teaching.

    Second, each person designated to learn from Soviet experts should formulate a study plan based on the length of the expert's term. The central content of the plan should clearly stipulate what to learn from the expert and to what extent. The way to formulate the plan can be for the learner to consult with the expert in advance based on their existing professional level, combined with the needs of current work, in the spirit of learning what to do, and supplementing what is lacking, to formulate it in a realistic manner.

    Some people believe that Soviet experts are cultivated over a period of one or twenty years. How can we learn the complete set of skills of Soviet experts in a year and a half? Yes, if we formulate such a study plan and put forward such a request, it is indeed unrealistic. However, we must not deny that with subjective efforts, we can learn some of the main skills of Soviet experts, and even more so, we cannot deny the role of the study plan and the necessity of putting forward learning requirements. The question is that the plan must be formulated appropriately and the requirements must be realistic. In order to learn more from Soviet experts in a relatively short period of time, we can also adopt the method of organizing and dividing the work to learn one or two skills from experts. Three cobblers can make a Zhuge Liang.

    Third, in learning, we should not only know what it is, but also know why it is so; we should not only know the superiority of Soviet advanced experience, but also be good at applying it to our work in light of China's actual conditions. Our learning attitude should be both modest and active, but also independent thinking, and we should oppose the lazy style of those who do not use their brains. As for the specific learning methods, they can be adapted to the time, place, and person (including the learner and the Soviet expert). For example, leading comrades are usually busy with their work, and the main thing they can do is to learn through daily discussions, studying the suggestions made by experts, leading experts to the site to inspect work, learning how Soviet experts discover problems or handle problems, asking Soviet experts to systematically explain one or two specialized issues, and so on. In addition to carefully studying the various suggestions put forward by experts, in order to systematically understand the spirit of the Soviet experts' suggestions, engineering and technical personnel can also ask Soviet experts to give lectures or ask experts to designate relevant books for self-study, and ask experts for guidance on difficult points. In addition to attending lectures, technical workers mainly learn from Soviet experts in actual operations. In short, there can be a variety of learning methods, and experience can be summarized and created in practice.

    Fourth, a certain inspection and assessment system should be established. Of course, any learning relies first and foremost on political consciousness, but a certain inspection and assessment system can further stimulate the enthusiasm for learning. Inspection and assessment can be carried out from the following three aspects:

    First, self-inspection by the designated members. For example, they must report to the leadership on the implementation of the learning plan every month, and after learning to a certain stage, they must report their learning experience to everyone orally or in writing. This will not only allow the masses to supervise, but also play a role in disseminating Soviet advanced experience.

    Second, learn about their learning situation from their mentor - the Soviet expert. We can ask Soviet experts to give them some questions to test them regularly, absorb relevant personnel to participate, and have the learners conduct technical defenses; or when the Soviet expert's term expires and they are about to return home, they can make a systematic report to the expert on their learning experience and how they understand some of the major suggestions made by the expert, and ask the expert to correct them.

    Finally, and most importantly, it is to see how they apply these new technologies and new experiences in their actual work, and how quickly they disseminate them to everyone, and what specific results have been produced in their work.

    After inspection and assessment, their learning performance should be given a certain evaluation and included as part of the cadre appraisal. Those who have learned well should be given appropriate encouragement or rewards, and those who have not completed the learning plan should be given criticism.

    Fifth, the leading comrades of each unit should personally take charge, and all relevant departments should cooperate to do a good job in organizing and leading the learning from Soviet experts. Learning from Soviet experts is a very detailed and complex issue involving all aspects. If it is not personally presided over by the leading comrades of the unit, it is difficult to truly carry out this work. However, the leading comrades are after all busy with their work and cannot often study this issue. Therefore, it is necessary to establish expert work agencies to help the leading comrades conduct supervision and inspection, investigation and research, discover problems, and summarize experience. On the other hand, other relevant departments cannot push all matters related to the work and life of experts to the expert work agency. Regarding the issue of organizing learning from Soviet experts, the cadre department will be responsible for selecting personnel, reviewing the list, paying attention not to easily transfer personnel who are fixed to learn from experts, and participating in the assessment of the learners and evaluating their performance. The education department will be responsible for organizing lectures by experts, organizing engineering and technical personnel who are fixed to learn from Soviet experts to disseminate Soviet advanced experience to ordinary employees, and so on. As for the work of running various training courses to invite Soviet experts to give lectures, studying or promoting the major suggestions of Soviet experts, etc., should be organized by the relevant business departments themselves. The expert work agency is responsible for understanding the learning status of the designated learners, supervising and inspecting them according to their learning plans, and organizing exchanges of learning experiences. The expert work agency should also maintain regular contact with the Soviet expert organization to discuss and improve issues related to learning from experts.

    Soviet experts are an extremely rare force in helping our country carry out socialist construction. We must fully value and utilize the strength of Soviet experts, learn from them in a planned and organized way, and through their help, truly cultivate a group of specialized talents to meet the needs of national construction.

    有计划有组织地向苏联专家学习
    国务院外国专家局副局长　吴凡吾
    要把落后的农业的中国改变成为先进的工业化的中国，并要争取在十二年之内，在一些主要门类的科学和技术水平上接近苏联和其他世界大国，除了调动国内一切积极因素，充分发挥我国自己的各种专家的力量外，还必须聘请一批苏联专家来帮助我们。现在已在我国工作的苏联专家，对于我国社会主义建设有着卓越的贡献，我们应当真诚地感谢他们。但是，最好的感谢办法是努力的向他们学习。周恩来总理在“关于知识分子问题的报告”中曾经强调地指出要向苏联专家学习。他说：“有计划地组织大批科学工作人员和技术人员向现在在中国的苏联专家学习，把他们当作导师来利用，而不要当作普通工作人员来利用。在苏联援助我国建设的一百五十六项企业的建设和生产过程中，有系统地组织大批技术人员研究和掌握其中的新的技术原理，并且加以迅速的传授”。
    几年来，我们向苏联专家学习，是有一定成绩的。但是，学习的成绩还不能令人满意，最主要的缺点就是没有有计划有组织地向他们学习。
    所以产生这个缺点，归结起来是由于两种错误思想在作祟。一种是以为反正年年可以聘请苏联专家，由此而产生了长期依赖苏联专家的思想。有这种思想的单位，就只把专家当作普通工作人员来利用，那里出了事故，就往那里派；他们平时不大注意学习，到专家一旦期满要返国时，就着了慌，一再要求延聘，留不住就要求重复聘请。这样不仅浪费苏联专家的力量，也有碍于自己力量的成长。另一种错误的观念是把有计划有组织地向苏联专家学习同完成当前建设和生产任务当作互相矛盾不可能结合进行的事情。其实这两者决不是矛盾的东西。有些苏联援助项目的企业，由于平时向苏联专家学习得不够，结果专家返国后，工程或生产中出了事故没法解决，只好又要求苏联专家来华指导，这不是严重的教训吗？目前我国仍是一个科学技术十分落后的国家，再不抓紧时间急起直追，充分利用苏联专家当作导师，将会给工作带来很大的损失。
    把苏联专家当作导师，有计划有组织地向他们学习，除了端正错误的思想以外，还需要采取一些具体措施。我认为：
    一、凡是聘有苏联专家的单位，应当指定若干同志固定向苏联专家学习。当然，人人都有义务也有权利向苏联专家学习；但所以还要指定一些专人，是因为只有重点培养出一批专门人才，以他们为骨干，才有可能再去普遍提高所有工作人员的科学技术水平。徒弟的数目总有一定的限制，否则师傅的精力和时间是来不及的。
    在选择人员时应当注意选择那些同苏联专家工作性质相近，业务联系较多，又具有一定的政治条件和业务水平的人。目前的偏向是对政治条件挑选过严，业务水平却相差太大，使教和学都增加了困难。
    人员选定了，应当不轻易调动他们的工作，并且适当减轻他们的一部分社会活动，以保证他们有较充分的时间向苏联专家学习。过去经常发生这样一些事：被指定向苏联专家学习的人员，在苏联专家亲手教导下，眼看即要培养成熟，忽然被调走了，使苏联专家感到很婉惜。另外，有些被指定向苏联专家学习的同志整天忙于开会，专家要找他谈话要一约再约，很难使苏联专家负起教的责任。
    二、应当使每个被指定向苏联专家学习的人员，根据专家聘期的长短，制定一个学习计划。计划的中心内容要明确规定向专家学什么，学到什么程度。制定计划的方式可以由学习人员根据自己现有的业务水平，结合当前工作的需要，本着做什么学什么，缺什么补什么的精神，同专家事先协商好，实事求是地来制定。
    有些人认为，苏联专家是经过一、二十年时间培养出来的，我们一年半载怎样能学会苏联专家的全套本领？是的，如果制定这样一种学习计划，提出这样一种要求，的确是不切合实际的。但是，决不能否认，经过主观努力可以学会苏联专家一些主要的本领，更不能因此而否认学习计划的作用，否认提出学习要求的必要性。问题在于计划要订得恰当，要求要切合实际。为了在较短时间内向苏联专家学到更多的东西，也可以采取组织起来分工向专家学习一、二项本领的办法，三个臭皮匠，就可以合成一个诸葛亮。
    三、在学习上应该不仅知其然，还要知其所以然；不仅要知道苏联先进经验的优越性，还要结合中国实际情况善于运用到工作中去。我们的学习态度，既要虚心积极，也要独立思考，反对不动脑筋的懒汉作风。至于具体的学习方法，可以因时、因地、因人（包括学习者和苏联专家）而制宜。比如领导同志平时工作较忙，主要的就可以通过日常谈工作、研究专家提出的建议、带领专家下现场检查工作，学习苏联专家发现问题或处理问题的方法、请苏联专家系统地讲解一二个专门性问题等等方式来学习。工程技术人员除了认真研究专家提出的各种建议外，为求有系统地领会苏联专家建议的精神实质，还可以请苏联专家上课或请专家指定有关书籍进行自修，疑难处请专家辅导。技术工人除参加听课外，主要是在实际操作中向苏联专家学习。总之，学习方法可以多种多样，在实践中可以总结和创造经验。
    四、应当建立一定的检查、考核制度。任何学习当然首先靠政治上自觉，但有一定的检查考核制度，更可以刺激学习的积极性。检查考核可以从以下三方面来进行：
    首先，由被指定的成员进行自我检查。如每月须向领导上报告学习计划执行的情况，学习到一定阶段以后，把自己的学习心得口头或书面的向大家报告一下。这样既能让群众进行监督，又起了传授苏联先进经验的作用。
    其次，从他的导师——苏联专家那里了解他的学习情况。可以请苏联专家定期出一些题目考问他，吸收有关人员参加，由学习者进行技术答辩；或者在苏联专家期满回国的时候，把自己的学习心得以及对专家提出的一些重大建议是怎样领会的，向专家作系统的汇报，请专家指正。
    最后，也是最重要的，是看他在实际工作中如何运用这些新技术、新经验，以及如何迅速地传授给大家，并在工作中产生了什么具体效果。
    经过检查考核以后，对他的学习成绩应给予一定的评价，并作为干部鉴定内容之一。对于学得好的人，应有适当的鼓励或奖励，未完成学习计划的人，应给予批评。
    五、应当由各单位领导同志亲自负责，各有关部门共同配合，作好向苏联专家学习的组织领导工作。向苏联专家学习是一件牵涉到各个方面的非常细致而又复杂的问题，假如不是由本单位的领导同志亲自主持，是难以把这项工作真正开展起来的。但是领导同志毕竟事情较忙，不可能经常研究这方面的问题，因此需要成立专家工作机构，帮助领导同志进行督促检查，调查研究、发现问题，总结经验。另一方面，其他有关部门也不能把所有有关专家工作、生活的事情全部推给专家工作机构。像组织向苏联专家学习的问题，干部部门就要负责挑选人员，审查名单，注意不要轻易调动固定向专家学习的人员，并且参与对学习人员的考核、评定成绩的工作。教育部门就要负责组织请专家上课，组织固定向苏联专家学习的工程技术人员向一般职工传授苏联先进经验等工作。至于像开办各种训练班请苏联专家讲课，研究或推广苏联专家的重大建议等等工作，应当由各有关业务部门自己负责组织。专家工作机构则负责了解被指定的学习人员学习状况，根据他们的学习计划进行督促检查并负责组织交流学习经验。专家工作机构还应与苏联专家组织方面经常保持联系，商讨改进有关向专家学习的问题。
    苏联专家在帮助我国进行社会主义建设中，是一支极其难得的力量。我们一定要充分重视和运用苏联专家的力量，有计划有组织地向他们学习，通过他们的帮助，真正培养出一批专门人才，以应国家建设的需要。
