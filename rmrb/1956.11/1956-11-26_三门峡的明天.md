    The Tomorrow of Sanmenxia
    By Our Correspondent Ye Jianyun

    Living in an era of happiness, people often yearn for tomorrow. "What will tomorrow be like?" This is something everyone is often concerned about. Like many others, longing for our tomorrow, I came to Sanmenxia on a particularly clear autumn day.
    Autumn in Sanmenxia is like a vividly colored painting. Wisps of clouds float in the blue sky. In the distant mountains, shepherds drive their flocks, and with the flick of their whips, the sheep resemble clouds rising on the horizon. The persimmon trees, laden with fruit, are covered with ripe yellow persimmons, sparkling and lovely in the sunlight. Looking from a height, the majestic and precipitous mountains, rugged and magnificent, are like two giant iron fists, tightly gripping the throat of the Yellow River. Torrential currents rush through the valley, with splashing waves and crashing shores.
    Sanmenxia, this ancient valley, like our ancient nation, every stone, every inch of land, people can endlessly talk about many beautiful and moving myths. What with the hoofprints on Ghost Gate Island, the three imprints of Human Gate River, the dressing table at the mouth of the Maidens River, the elixir furnace beside the Pillar Stone, and the bridge built by immortals… I don't know why, but I was deeply impressed by the myth of the immortal building the bridge.
    A long, long time ago, on a cloudless autumn day, an immortal came to Sanmenxia. He loved the mountains here and was reluctant to leave the water, although the mountains of Sanmenxia were bare and the water was muddy, he settled here. As the days passed, he wanted to build a bridge here. After a few days, the immortal used his magic to move mountains and overturn seas, moving three mountain peaks from the nearby Wangwu Mountain and gently placing them in the heart of the river, which were the bridge piers he envisioned. Just as he was about to move golden bridge decks and silver railings from even further away, a war of mutual slaughter broke out in the human world. This compassionate immortal was furious and immediately left the place. On the night of his departure, people seemed to hear an elder mumbling in mid-air: "It seems that this golden bridge with silver holes can only be built in an era of peace and prosperity..."
    For thousands of years, the myth of the immortal building the bridge has been circulating far and wide, but the bridge in Sanmenxia has never been built.
    In a row of workers' sheds, I met a group of people who are turning the myth into reality. They include surveying teams from the Fengman Hydropower Station, mechanical construction teams who built the Guanting Reservoir, as well as wind drill operators and blasters from Gutian, Fujian, water conservancy workers who conquered the Huai River, and road construction workers who passed through the Qinling Mountains on the Baoji-Chengdu Railway. The people here are busy and joyful. I remember during the war years, when I was working in the People's Liberation Army, when I first crossed the Yellow River due to military action, with pursuers behind, planes above, and rapids below, how much difficulty the Yellow River brought us! After the troops crossed the river, there was an intense battle. When we could finally breathe a sigh of relief, the comrades began to discuss. One spring night, the locust flowers in the courtyard were particularly intoxicating, and the azaleas in the fields were singing, a scene of peace unfolded before us. People were talking about what positions to transfer to after the war ended! In those days, I had heard the "conquer the Yellow River" shouted by steel warriors, and today, that sound rings again in my ears.
    "Our country is a country with 540 million kilowatts of hydropower resources..." A young engineer pointed to a colored map and said to me, "540 million kilowatts, what a huge number! If fully developed, it can provide each of our 600 million people with thousands of kilowatt-hours of electricity. We are determined to develop these treasures. Building a dam in Sanmenxia is the beginning of our action." His conversation was full of grand ideals, heroic spirit, and firm determination.
    In the past, the Japanese and Americans had dreamed of building a dam in Sanmenxia, their purpose was to plunder our water resources and leave the Yellow River disaster on our land forever. The Sanmenxia Dam we are building is a completely new type of project, which must both prevent floods, generate electricity, and take on the tasks of irrigation and navigation.
    The current Sanmenxia Reservoir is very different from what I knew in the past. When Comrade Deng Zihui made the Yellow River planning report in 1955, the area of the reservoir was only 2,350 square kilometers, and the capacity of the reservoir was only 36 billion cubic meters. Now the water level has increased to 360 meters, the reservoir area has increased to 3,500 square kilometers, and the capacity has increased to 70 billion cubic meters. The benefits of this change are enormous. The increase in storage capacity not only extends the life of the reservoir, but also brings more benefits to flood control, power generation, irrigation, and navigation. This change almost doubles the irrigated area in the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River. The now-determined reservoir capacity is equivalent to seven times that of China's Fengman Reservoir and more than thirty times that of the Guanting Reservoir. So much water stored here eliminates the threat of floods to 80 million residents below Sanmenxia. In addition, if the Sanmenxia Reservoir stores sufficient water, it will provide a reliable guarantee for solving the drought in North China.
    Water, a resource praised by modern people as "white coal," inexhaustible and inexhaustible, when talking to the people building Sanmenxia, it seems so energetic. One morning, I and Wang Huayun, deputy director of the Engineering Bureau, drove to the Sanmenxia dam site. He enthusiastically talked about the problem of hydropower generation.
    "Sanmenxia can generate 6 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity every year." This deputy director, who has worked on the Yellow River for eleven years, said to me, "Hydropower is the cheapest. The cost of the Sanmenxia Hydropower Station is less than one-tenth of the cost of thermal power generation. Based on a coal consumption of 0.6 kg per kilowatt-hour, the Sanmenxia Power Station can save the country 3.6 million tons of coal in one year." Then he said: "The cost of the Sanmenxia Power Station is not only cheap, but also because the location is suitable, it is no more than 400 kilometers away from China's industrial cities of Xi'an, Taiyuan, Luoyang, and Zhengzhou. According to scientific calculations, it is the most economical and cost-effective to erect power transmission lines within 400 kilometers."
    The car climbed over hills and ridges, and soon arrived at the Sanmenxia dam site. The car stopped at the head of the dam. In fact, it is inappropriate to say the head of the dam, because besides a row of neat tents and drill rig towers and steel cable suspension bridges erected on the Yellow River, the surrounding area is full of continuous mountain ranges, mountain peaks lying across the Yellow River, and the mountain ranges on the south bank are almost connected together. Triangular red flags and black and white clear hydrological markers are dotted between the bare mountains. The Sanmen River issued a whistling sound, which echoed in the canyon. At this time, Comrade Wang Huayun led us to the pier of the cable bridge.
    After passing through two sections of the cable bridge, we climbed the mountain peak of Shenmen Island. Looking west, several small sailboats in the distance were bumping in the riverbed, and camel and mule teams were walking on the white beaches on both sides. Ancient poets, when describing the difficult traffic in Sanmenxia, wrote: "The Ghost Gate is deep and ghostly, requiring a hundred poles, the Human Gate is narrow and even more difficult; boatmen shout as they ferry, life is as light as a feather." Being there, this scene is truly breathtaking.
    In front of us, the Yellow River made a big turn here, revealing a small river valley basin. This is a corner of the future Sanmen Lake. In the future, when the reservoir stores water, the lakeside towns in Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Henan will become bustling land and water terminals where merchants gather. After some rectification of the downstream river channel, cargo ships of 500 tons can go directly from Zhengzhou to the sea. In the future, if a ship lock is installed in Sanmenxia, the ships on the Yellow River can go directly from the sea to Lanzhou. After the Yellow River is open to navigation, it will be equivalent to adding a railway trunk line of several thousand kilometers long, connecting seven or eight provinces in the vast North China Plain. In the future, the area of Sanmen Lake will be one-third larger than Taihu Lake, China's third largest freshwater lake. The water in the reservoir averages about 20 meters deep. If fish are raised here, they can be raised in several layers. According to preliminary estimates, after the water surface is fully utilized, the income from aquatic products alone can offset the income from submerging 3 million mu of land.
    A comrade traveling with me joked: "People in Shanxi don't like to eat fish. If Sanmen Lake produces a lot of fish and shrimp in the future, they will have to change their living habits!" This sentence caused a burst of laughter. Transforming the Yellow River is transforming the face of our country's nature. In a few years, a boundless artificial lake will appear here, and the land of fish and rice of Jiangnan will appear on the Loess Plateau. At that time, there will be green mountains and green waters here, and the dry climate will also become moist. With the changes in natural conditions, the living habits of the residents by the lake will also have to change. From then on, on the Loess Plateau in Northwest China, which is larger than the British mainland, there will appear: gentle willows blowing in the wind, clear streams winding around the houses; lush green crops connecting to the clouds, and green gardens with orchards facing the water, forming ten thousand acres of fertile land.
    "The scale of the Sanmenxia project is huge." After we came to the left bank of the Yellow River, Li Eding, chief engineer of the Engineering Bureau, casually spread out the drawings on the hillside, pointing and saying. "After the dam site was determined, Soviet and Chinese experts selected three dam axis lines and proposed twelve dam type schemes, comparing each dam type scheme. The dam built here is not only cheap, but also technically the most advanced. The dam built here in the future will be 120 meters high." He pointed to the small mountain peak on the opposite side and gestured to me: "This dam is almost as high as this mountain, and the cross-section of the dam foundation is 130 meters." Following his fingers, and looking at the surrounding mountains, there is no feeling of desolation at all. On the turbulent Sanmen River, it is as if a copper wall and iron wall stand in front of us. It is said that the relevant units are currently considering the problem of connecting the Longhai Railway and the Tongpu Railway, and using the Sanmenxia Dam as a bridge to connect the two lines. A hundred years ago, people said that "there is only one bridge on the Yellow River in the world," and this bridge was the pontoon bridge built with wooden boats and rafts in Beiguan, Lanzhou. Decades later, iron bridges appeared on the Yellow River, and now, not only are there numerous iron bridges, but there will also be huge and solid flood control and power generation dams, on which trains can also run.
    To build this dam, 9 million tons of sand and gravel materials alone are needed. To obtain so many materials, it is necessary to dig one zhang (about 3.3 meters) deep in a material production area ten li (about 5 kilometers) wide and one li long. The transportation alone would require seventy trains running day and night for three consecutive years to complete. During the peak dam pouring period, 90,000 cubic meters of concrete will be produced here every day.
    We climbed a higher mountain, facing the canyon with mountains connected to mountains and ridges connected to ridges. This is the future railway station, through which it is connected to major industrial cities across the country. There are concrete mixing buildings, which are taller than four-story buildings, as well as the base of cable and tower cranes. In Huixing Town, 17 kilometers from the dam site, there are large-scale prefabricated concrete factories, reinforcing steel processing factories, wood processing factories, hydraulic machinery installation factories, and mechanical repair factories. The products made by the Huixing factory are transported by transport vehicles and handling machinery, tens of thousands of tons at a time, to the dam head and poured into the rolling Yellow River. Looking intently, it seems that what is in front of us is no longer a mountainous area with rocks piercing the sky, but a modern industrial area...
    At this time, blasting sounds came from all around. The mountain excavation project of each working section system began. The dust raised by the blasting and the loud noise shook this ancient valley. The torrents of the Ghost Gate River and the God Gate River flowed eastward non-stop. The face of Sanmenxia is changing rapidly.

    三门峡的明天
    本报记者　叶剑韵
    生活在幸福的时代，人们往往会向往着明天，“明天怎么样呢”，这是每个人经常关心着的事情。和许多人的心境一样，为了向往我们的明天，一个秋天特有的晴朗的日子，我来到了三门峡。
    三门峡的秋天，像一幅色彩鲜艳的图画，蓝蓝的天上飘浮着丝丝的浮云，远处的山梁上，牧羊人赶着羊群，随着鞭子的飞舞，羊群像天边泛起的云朵；果实累累的柿树林，挂满了黄熟的柿子，经日光照射，晶莹可爱；登高远望，那巍峨险峻，苍莽雄浑的群山，像两只巨大的铁拳，紧紧地卡住了黄河的咽喉，激流冲过峡谷，浪花飞溅，惊涛拍岸。
    三门峡这个古老的峡谷，像我们古老的民族一样，每一方石块，每一寸土地，人们都可以滔滔不绝地谈说起许许多多美丽动人的神话。什么鬼门岛的马蹄窝，人门河的三颗印，娘娘河口的梳妆台，砥柱石畔的炼丹炉，还有什么仙人造桥……不知是什么癖好，我对仙人造桥的神话却留下了深刻的印象。
    在很久很久以前，一个云淡天高的秋天，有个仙人来到了三门峡，他喜爱这儿的山，也留恋这儿的水，虽然三门峡的山是光秃的，水是混浊的，他却在这儿住下了。日子住长了，他想在这儿修一座桥；几天以后，仙人用上了移山倒海的法术，从附近王屋山上搬来了三座山峰，轻轻地置放在河心，这就是他意想中的桥墩。当他正要从更远的地方搬来金桥面银栏杆的时候，人世间却发生了相互残杀的战争。这位心肠慈悲的仙人恼怒了，马上就离开了这儿，在他离去的夜晚，人们仿佛听到半空中有位长者在叨咕着：“看来这座金桥银孔，只有到太平盛世才能修成了……”
    几千年来，仙人造桥的神话在远近流传着，三门峡的桥却一直没有修起来。
    在一排工棚中间，我会见了一群将神话变为现实的人。他们有来自丰满水电站的勘测队员，有建设官厅水库的机械施工队，还有福建古田的风钻手和放炮工，战胜淮河的水利建设工作者，穿过秦岭的宝成铁路的筑路工人也来到了这儿。这儿的人是忙碌的，也是喜悦的。记得在战争的年代，那时我在人民解放军里工作，当第一次因为军事行动从黄河上走过的时候，后有追兵，上有飞机，下有急流，黄河，它给我们带来了多少的困难啊！队伍过了河，紧接着又是激烈的战斗。等到松一口气的时候，战友们又议论开了。一个春天的夜晚，院子里的槐树花特别醉人，田野里的杜鹃在歌唱着，一幅和平景象展现在面前了。人们在谈论着，战争结束了，转业到什么岗位上去哩！当年我曾听过钢铁战士喊出的“征服黄河”的声音，今天，这个声音又在我的耳膜上响起来了。
    “我们的国家，是一个拥有五亿四千万瓩水力资源的国家……”一位年轻的工程师指着彩色的地图对我说：“五亿四千万瓩这是一个多么庞大的数字啊！如果全部得到开发的话，它可以使我国六亿人民每人获得几千度电。我们是有决心开发这些宝藏的。在三门峡这儿筑坝，就是我们行动的开始。”他的谈话充满着远大的理想，豪迈的气魄和坚毅的决心。
    过去，日本人和美国人都曾梦想过在三门峡筑坝，他们的目的是想劫夺我国的水力资源，把黄河灾害永远留在我们的土地上。我们兴建的三门峡大坝，则是一项完全新式的工程，既要它防洪，又要它发电，还要它担负起灌溉和航运的任务。
    现在的三门峡水库比我过去所了解的已经有了很大的变化。1955年邓子恢同志在作黄河规划报告的时候，水库的面积只有二千三百五十平方公里，水库的容量不过三百六十亿公方，现在水位增高到三百六十公尺，水库面积增加到三千五百平方公里，容量增加到七百亿公方。这个变化给我们带来的好处那就大的很了。库容加大了，不仅水库的寿命延长了，对防洪、发电、灌溉、航运来说好处那就更多了。这一变化，几乎使黄河中下游的灌溉面积增加了一倍。现在确定的水库的容积相等于我国丰满水库的七倍，等于官厅水库的三十多倍。这里蓄存了这么多水，使三门峡以下八千万居民免除了洪水的威胁。另外，如果三门峡水库蓄存了充裕的水，对解决华北地区的旱灾来说，就有了可靠的保障了。
    水，这个为近代人誉为“白煤”的取之不尽用之不竭的资源，在建设三门峡的人谈起来显得那样劲头十足。一天早晨，我和工程局副局长王化云乘车去三门峡坝址的途中，他热情地谈起了水力发电的问题。
    “三门峡每年可以发六十亿度电。”这位在黄河上工作了十一年的副局长对我说，“水力发电是最便宜的，三门峡水电站的成本还不及火力发电成本的十分之一；以每度电耗煤零点六公斤计算，一年内三门峡电站就可以为国家节省三百六十万吨的燃煤。”接着他又说：“三门峡电站的成本不仅是便宜的，而且由于地点适中，它距离我国的工业城市西安、太原、洛阳、郑州都不超过四百公里，根据科学计算，在四百公里以内架设输电线，这是最节省最合算的。”
    汽车越岭爬坡，很快就到了三门峡坝址了。车子在坝头上停了下来。其实，说坝头这是不恰当的，这里，除了一排排整洁的帐篷和钻机的塔架和架设在黄河上的钢索吊桥以外，周围尽是连绵不断的山岭，横躺在黄河上的山峰，和南岸的山岭几乎是连在一起的。三角小红旗和黑白显明的水文标志点缀在光山秃岭之间。三门河上发出呼啸的声音，在峡谷里引起了共鸣，这时王化云同志把我们引上了索桥的码头。
    走过两段索桥，我们登上了神门岛的山峰，极目西望，远处的几只小帆船在河槽里颠颠簸簸，两岸白色的沙滩上行走着驼骡队。古代诗人在形容三门峡的交通艰险时曾写过：“鬼门幽幽深百篙，人门逼窄愈两牢；舟人叫渡口流血，性命咫尺轻鸿毛。”身临其境，这种情景，真使人惊心动魄。
    在我们的前方，黄河在这儿拐了一个大弯，露出了一段不大的河谷盆地，这里是未来三门湖的一角，将来水库蓄起水来，山西、陕西、河南的沿湖城镇都要变成商旅云集的水陆码头了。下游河道，经过一番整治，五百吨的客货轮船，就可以从郑州直放海口，将来在三门峡装上了过船闸，黄河上的轮船，就可以从海口直放兰州了。黄河通航以后，在辽阔的华北平原上，就等于增添了一条几千公里长，沟通七八个省区的铁路干线。将来三门湖的面积比我国第三个大的淡水湖太湖还要大三分之一。水库里的水平均有二十来公尺深，在这儿养鱼的话可以养几层，据初步估算，水面得到充分利用以后，仅水产一项的收入，就可以抵偿淹没三百万亩土地的收益。
    同行的一位同志开玩笑地说：“山西人不爱吃鱼，将来三门湖出产了大量的鱼虾，那时候他们得改变生活习惯吧！”这句话引起了大家的一阵哄笑。改造黄河，就是改造我国大自然的面貌。几年以后，这儿出现了一望无际的人工湖，江南的鱼米之乡将要在黄土高原上出现了。那时候，这里有青的山，有绿的水，旱燥的气候也润泽起来了；湖滨的居民随着自然条件的变化，生活习惯也得改变了。从此在我国西北这块比英国本土还要大的黄土高原上，将会出现：弱柳迎风吹，清溪绕户来；禾黍连云碧，园林对水开的良田万顷、果树成林的绿色花园了。
    “三门峡工程的规模是巨大的。”我们来到黄河左岸以后，工程局总工程师李鹗鼎同志随手在山坡上摊开了图纸边指边说。“确定了坝址以后，苏联和中国的专家们，又选择了三条坝轴线，还拟了十二个坝型方案，将每个坝型方案进
  行了比较，在这儿建筑的大坝不仅是便宜的，而且在技术上也是最先进的。将来在这儿修造的大坝有一百二十公尺高。”他指了指对面山上的那个小山峰向我比划着：“这座坝差不多和这座山一样高，坝基的断面是一百三十公尺。”随着他的手指，再看看周围的群山，一点也没有荒凉的感觉。在奔腾湍激的三门河上，像有一座铜墙铁壁矗立在我们面前。据说目前有关单位正在考虑把陇海路和同蒲路衔接起来的问题，并且利用三门峡大坝作为两条线路联结的桥梁。一百年前，人们都说“天下黄河只一桥”，这座桥就是兰州北关用木船和筏子架起来的浮桥；几十年以后，黄河上出现了铁桥，现在，不仅有了为数众多的铁桥，而且还将有巨大而坚固的拦洪发电大坝，在这座坝上还可以走火车。
    要修这座大坝，光是砂石材料就需要九百万吨，这么多材料，要在十里宽一里长的材料产地挖地一丈才能取得。仅是运输，就需要七十挂列车日夜不停连续三年的时间才能运完。大坝浇筑高峰期间，这儿每天要生产九万立方公尺的混凝土。
    我们爬上了一座更高的山，面对着山连山岭接岭的峡谷，这儿是未来的火车站，通过它和全国各大工业城市联系起来。那儿是比四层楼房还要高大的混凝土拌和楼，还有揽式和塔式起重机的基地；距坝址十七公里的会兴镇，那儿有规模巨大的混凝土预制工厂、钢筋加工厂、木材加工厂、水力机械安装工厂、机械修配厂。通过运输工具和搬运机械把会兴工厂制成的产品，几万吨几万吨地运到坝头上倾泻在滚滚的黄河里。凝神看去，仿佛在我们面前的已不是乱石穿空的山区，而是一座近代化的工业区了……。
    这时四周传来了爆破声，各工段系统的山地开挖工程开始了。爆破扬起的尘土，发出的巨响，震荡着这古老的峡谷。鬼门河神门河的激流，瞬息不停地向东逝去。三门峡的面貌，在迅速地变化着。
