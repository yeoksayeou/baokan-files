Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 14th. Planning and design work has begun in Guangxi Province's three major cities: Nanning, Guilin, and Liuzhou. Over one hundred surveyors are working intensely on urban control measurements, conducting a general survey of the city's stratum structure, and carrying out focused geological drilling in coordination with the newly selected factory sites.

The planning work is progressing fastest in Nanning City, which has already completed the design of preliminary plans for the new industrial zone, road network direction maps, and other designs. It is expected that the overall urban planning design will be completed before March of next year. Guilin City, after completing the planning and design scheme for the scenic area, is now also starting to collect data and conduct surveys in order to formulate a new industrial zone plan.

These three cities are located along the Xiang-Gui Railway, with convenient transportation and abundant resources in the vicinity. They have always been the political, economic, and cultural centers of Guangxi Province. Guilin City, famous for its "unparalleled landscape," will gradually develop into an industrial center of northern Guangxi after planning. Liuzhou City was originally the province's industrial center, and new factories such as paper mills and cotton textile mills will be built in the future. Before liberation, Nanning City's urban area was only 4.52 square kilometers, with a population of only 91,000 people. According to the new plan, the urban area and population will greatly increase. Currently, several modern factories are being built or are about to be built in Nanning City, and schools will also be added successively.

    南宁桂林柳州进行城市规划
    新华社南宁14日电　广西省南宁、桂林、柳州三个主要城市的规划设计工作已经先后开始。一百多名勘测人员正在紧张地进行市区控制测量，普查市区地层结构状况和配合新选厂址有重点地进行地质钻探工作。
    规划工作进展较快的南宁市，目前已经完成了新工业区的规划草图、道路网方向图等设计，预计明年3月以前就可以完成全市总体规划设计。桂林市在完成了风景区的规划设计方案以后，现在也在着手搜集资料和勘测工作，以便拟定新工业区方案。
    这三个城市位于湘桂铁路沿线，交通方便，城市附近资源丰富，历来都是广西省政治、经济和文化中心。以“山水甲天下”著称的桂林市，规划以后将逐步发展成为桂北的工业中心。柳州市原来就是省的工业中心，将来还要新建造纸、棉纺织等新工厂。南宁市的市区面积解放以前只有四点五二平方公里，人口只有九万一千人。按照新的规划，市区面积和人口都大大增加。现在，好几个现代化工厂正在南宁市兴建或即将兴建，学校也将陆续增加。
