Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 29th: After the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway opened to traffic up to Yumen, it continued to lay another 150 kilometers of track westward. To date, this railway has laid a total of 942 kilometers of track westward from Lanzhou.

Currently, on the vast Gobi Desert ahead where tracks have not yet been laid, tens of thousands of workers are braving the severe cold of more than ten degrees below zero Celsius, constructing roadbeds and building bridges, removing obstacles to continued advancement. So far, another dozens of kilometers of roadbed and bridge culverts have been basically constructed. All staff and workers are striving to lay more than 70 kilometers of track before the end of the year.

    兰新路在挺进
    据新华社兰州29日电　兰新铁路通车玉门以后，又继续向西铺设了一百五十公里的轨道。至此，这条铁路总共从兰州向西铺轨九百四十二公里。
    现在，在前方还没有铺轨的大戈壁上，几万名工人正在摄氏零下十多度的严寒中，修筑路基、建设桥梁，扫除掉继续前进的障碍。到目前为止，又有几十公里的一段路基和桥梁涵洞基本上修筑好了。全体职工争取在年底以前再铺设七十多公里轨道。
