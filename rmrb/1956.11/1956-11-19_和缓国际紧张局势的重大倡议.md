    The Soviet government, using all its possible conditions, has made one great effort after another to eliminate the danger of war, stop the incitement of the Cold War, and ease international tensions. Now, the Soviet government's statement on the issue of disarmament and easing international tensions is another very important measure. It puts forward new and major initiatives for breaking the disarmament issue that has been in a deadlock for a long time, including a willingness to consider the aerial photography proposal used by the United States to obstruct disarmament, and puts forward specific proposals on the matter. The Chinese people express their warmest welcome and support for this major initiative of the Soviet government and for this new effort made by the Soviet government for peace.
    The disarmament issue is the most urgent and important international issue that needs to be resolved. A substantial reduction of armaments by major powers and other countries, the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons, and ultimately the abolition of all kinds of armed forces and armaments will fundamentally guarantee lasting international peace and cooperation, the permanent elimination of the threat of war, and the reduction of the people's military expenditure burden. This is what peace-loving countries and people all over the world have been longing for for more than ten years after the war. People's expectations are particularly eager at present. Because, although the Cold War and arms race policy pursued by the imperialist bloc has been repeatedly frustrated and defeated, they are intensifying this policy. Although the British, French, and Israeli aggressors have been forced to announce a ceasefire in Egypt, they are still trying to refuse to withdraw their troops from Egypt under various pretexts, and are carrying out various conspiracies to make the flames of war prone to rekindle. Although the armed rebellion launched by imperialists and counter-revolutionaries against Hungary has failed, they have not given up and are launching a Cold War movement against the Soviet Union, against communism, and against democracy around the world. These new evil activities of the imperialist bloc have created international tensions and seriously threatened world peace. Under such circumstances, striving to achieve international disarmament and the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons is of particularly great significance.
    The new disarmament proposals put forward in the Soviet statement are very timely and practical. The levels of armed forces reduction of major powers and other countries, the steps to ban atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and first stop the testing of these weapons, and the measures to implement corresponding effective international supervision in this new initiative are all the main issues that the Soviet Union has consistently strived to reach an agreement on in the eleven years of disarmament negotiations. Moreover, the major powers have reached relatively close or consistent opinions on several major issues, such as the level of major powers' phased reduction of armed forces, the implementation of the ban on atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons after a certain date, and the principle of implementing effective international supervision. The reason why the entire disarmament issue remains in a deadlock is entirely the responsibility of the Western countries. Whenever the Soviet Union accepted their proposals, the Western countries, especially the United States, immediately retreated and abandoned their own proposals. The United States rigidly insisted on talking only about supervision and not about disarmament, and on the issue of supervision, it wanted to narrow it down to the issue of collecting military intelligence. Since the Geneva Four-Power Summit Conference in July last year, the United States has stubbornly clung to the aerial photography proposal, using it as a shield to obstruct disarmament agreements, making disarmament negotiations difficult.
    Now, the Soviet Union's new disarmament initiative has knocked the shield used by the United States to obstruct disarmament to the ground. As everyone knows, the aerial photography plan insisted on by the United States is not an effective way to solve the problem of international supervision and inspection, and it itself contains the possible consequences of collecting military intelligence of other countries, promoting distrust between countries, and thereby exacerbating the arms race. However, taking aerial photography as part of solving the problem of international supervision and reaching an agreement on the entire disarmament issue is not something that cannot be considered. Now, it is precisely based on this point, and in view of the fact that the aerial photography issue has become a serious obstacle to reaching a disarmament agreement, the Soviet Union has expressed that, with the consent of the countries concerned, aerial photography can be carried out within 800 kilometers east and west of the demarcation line between the main armed forces of the North Atlantic Group and the main armed forces of the Warsaw Treaty member states stationed in Europe. It can be seen that this concession is an organic part of the Soviet Union's entire proposal on disarmament, and its purpose is to prevent the resolution of the disarmament issue from continuing to be delayed due to the aerial photography issue. No one can fail to express deep emotion for the sincere consultation attitude adopted by the Soviet Union in seeking to reach a disarmament agreement.
    The United States has always said that the key to the disarmament issue lies in whether the aerial photography issue can be resolved. When Eisenhower put forward the aerial photography proposal, he said: "If we can begin to establish this kind of inspection as the beginning of the inspection system, we may develop it into a more extensive system, and finally establish an effective and lasting disarmament system on the basis of this system." Then, now, if the United States is not just using the aerial photography proposal to obstruct the disarmament agreement, there is no reason not to accept the new Soviet proposal.
    As the Soviet statement solemnly pointed out, the current serious struggle in the world is: to achieve disarmament and create all conditions for peaceful coexistence, or to continue the Cold War and the arms race, leading to new wars. Peace-loving people all over the world demand that the United States and other Western countries show sincerity and seek a solution to the disarmament issue on the basis of the Soviet proposals, in order to establish lasting peace and international cooperation.
    The Soviet Union advocates convening a five-nation government summit and a broader meeting including the heads of government of the People's Republic of China, India, Yugoslavia, Indonesia, and Burma to discuss the disarmament issue and seek a final solution to this issue. We believe that this is a very necessary and effective way. Such a meeting will make a major contribution to promoting international trust and easing the international situation.
    The Soviet government's statement and disarmament proposals once again prove that the Soviet Union insists on making consistent efforts to peacefully resolve international issues, eliminate the arms race and the threat of war, and promote international trust and cooperation. At present, in order to divert people's attention from their aggression against Egypt, and in order to cover up their conspiracy to continue new adventures after their failure to subvert the Hungarian people's democratic system, the imperialist bloc is spreading lies to slander the Soviet Union's peaceful policies and stirring up an anti-Soviet and anti-communist wave. Their purpose is obviously to re-ignite war mania and exacerbate international tensions, so as to continue to expand the arms race and step up preparations for new wars. However, this trick of the imperialist bloc will never succeed. The Soviet Union and the socialist countries have been and will continue to insist on taking the interests of safeguarding and consolidating the peace and cooperation of the people of all countries as the starting point of their foreign policy. All those who are willing to quickly stop the current threat of war and ease international tensions will surely value the significance of the Soviet Union's new disarmament proposals and give them their full support.

### 和缓国际紧张局势的重大倡议

    和缓国际紧张局势的重大倡议
    苏联政府运用自己的一切可能条件，为消除战争危险，制止冷战煽动，和缓国际紧张局势，作了一次又一次的巨大努力。现在苏联政府发表的关于裁军和缓和国际紧张局势问题的声明，又是一个十分重要的措施。它为打破长期陷于僵局的裁军问题提出了新的重大的倡议，其中包括愿意考虑美国借以阻挠裁军的空中摄影建议，并提出了有关的具体主张。中国人民对于苏联政府这个重大倡议，对于苏联政府为和平作出的这个新的努力，表示最热烈的欢迎和支持。
    裁军问题是最迫切地需要解决的重大国际问题。各大国大量裁减军备，禁止原子武器和氢武器，直到最后取消一切种类的武装力量和军备，将使持久的国际和平和合作，永远消除战争威胁和人民的军费负担，得到根本的保证。这是战后十多年来全世界爱好和平的国家和人民所一直渴望的。目前人们寄予的期望特别殷切。因为，帝国主义集团执行的冷战和军备竞赛政策，虽然一再遭到挫折和失败，但是它们正在变本加厉地推行这个政策。英、法、以色列侵略者虽然已被迫在埃及宣布停火，但是它们仍企图用各种借口拒绝从埃及撤兵，并且正进行各种阴谋，使战火有复燃的危险。帝国主义和反革命分子向匈牙利发动的武装叛乱虽然已经失败了，但是它们并未死心，并正在全世界范围内煽起一个反苏反共反民主的冷战运动。帝国主义集团这些新的罪恶活动，造成了国际间的紧张局势，使世界和平受到了严重威胁。在这种情况下，争取实现国际裁军和禁止原子武器和氢武器，就具有特别重大的意义。
    苏联声明所提出的新的裁军建议是十分适时和切合实际的。这个新倡议中关于大国和其他国家裁减武装部队的水平，关于禁止原子武器、氢武器、首先停止这些武器的试验的步骤，关于实施相应的有效的国际监督的措施，都是十一年裁军谈判中苏联一贯争取达成协议的主要问题。而且，各大国在几个重大问题上，例如，关于大国分期裁减武装部队的水平问题，在一定日期后实行禁止原子武器和氢武器，以及必须实施有效的国际监督的原则等问题，已经取得了比较接近或一致的意见。整个裁军问题之所以仍然陷于僵局，责任完全在于西方国家。每当苏联接受了它们的建议时，西方国家，特别是美国就马上后退，放弃了自己的建议。美国僵硬地坚持只谈监督，不谈裁军，而在监督问题上又想把它缩小为收集军事情报的问题。自从去年7月日内瓦四国首脑会议以来，美国死死抓住空中摄影的建议，把它作为阻挠裁军协议的挡箭牌，使得裁军谈判寸步难行。
    现在，苏联的裁军新倡议，把美国阻挠裁军的这个挡箭牌打落在地下了。大家知道美国坚持的空中摄影计划，并不是解决国际监督和视察问题的有效办法，而且它本身包藏着收集别国军事情报，促成国与国间的不信任，从而加剧军备竞赛的可能后果。但是，把空中摄影作为解决国际监督问题的一个部分，使整个裁军问题达成协议，那不是不可考虑的。现在苏联正是根据这一点，并鉴于空中摄影问题已成为达成裁军协议的严重障碍，因此，表示在有关国家的同意下，可以在北大西洋集团主要武装力量和华沙条约各参加国的主要武装力量在欧洲驻扎地区分界线东西各八百公里以内实行空中摄影。可以看出，这个让步是苏联关于裁军问题的全部建议的有机部分，其目的在于使裁军问题的解决不致因空中摄影问题而继续拖延下去。任何人都不能不对苏联为谋求达成裁军协议而采取的真诚协商态度表示深深的感动。
    美国一直口口声声说，裁军问题的关键在于是否能解决空中摄影问题。艾森豪威尔在提出空中摄影建议时就说过：“如果我们能够着手建立这种视察作为视察制度的开始，我们就可能把它发展成为一个较为广泛的制度，并最后在这个制度的基础上建立一个有效的和持久的裁军制度”。那末，现在，如果美国不只是拿空中摄影的建议来阻挠裁军协议，就再没有任何理由不接受苏联的新建议。
    正如苏联声明所郑重指出的，世界目前的严重斗争是：实现裁军，为和平共处创造一切条件，还是继续冷战和军备竞赛，导向新的战争。全世界爱好和平的人民都要求美国和其他西方国家拿出诚意来，在苏联建议的基础上求得裁军问题的解决，以建立持久和平和国际合作。
    苏联主张召开五国政府首脑会议和更广泛的包括中华人民共和国、印度、南斯拉夫、印度尼西亚和缅甸等国政府首脑参加的会议，来讨论裁军问题，寻求这个问题的最后解决。我们认为这是十分必要的和切实有效的途径。这样的会议将会为促进国际信任，和缓国际局势作出重大的贡献。
    苏联政府的声明和裁军建议，再一次证明苏联坚持为和平解决国际问题，消除军备竞赛和战争威胁，促进国际信任和合作而进行着一贯的努力。目前，帝国主义集团为了转移人们对它们侵略埃及的注意力，为了掩盖它们在颠复匈牙利人民民主制度遭到失败后继续进行新冒险的阴谋，正在大肆散布诽谤苏联和平政策的谎言，掀动反苏反共的浪潮。它们的目的显然是想重新煽起战争狂热，加剧国际紧张局势，以便继续扩大军备竞赛，加紧准备新的战争。但是，帝国主义集团的这个诡计是决不能得逞的。苏联和社会主义国家过去是、将来还是坚持把维护和巩固各国人民的和平和合作的利益，作为自己的外交政策的出发点。所有愿意迅速制止目前的战争威胁，和缓国际紧张局势的人，都一定会重视苏联的新的裁军建议的意义，并予以全力的支持。
