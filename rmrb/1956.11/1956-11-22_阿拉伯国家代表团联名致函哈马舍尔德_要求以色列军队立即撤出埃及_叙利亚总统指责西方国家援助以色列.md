Xinhua News Agency, November 21st - According to an Agence France-Presse report from New York on November 20th: Delegations from eleven Arab countries have jointly written a letter to United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskjöld, demanding that Israeli troops immediately withdraw behind the demarcation line between Egypt and Israel.

The letter mentions news reports stating that Israeli authorities have taken savage actions against residents of the Gaza Strip and Palestinian Arab refugees. The letter accuses Israeli authorities of carrying out "assassinations, deportations, acts of terror, and intimidation."

The Arab delegations requested that Hammarskjöld bring this matter to the attention of the United Nations representatives.

Xinhua News Agency, November 21st - Damascus News: Syrian President Shukri al-Quwatli told United Press International reporters on November 20th that the weapons, money, and other forms of support given by Western countries to Israel have severely undermined the balance of power in the Middle East. Israel frequently uses this Western aid to attack its Arab neighbors.

Quwatli said that the West has given the Israelis guns, French Mystère aircraft, as well as American Sabre jets and tanks, and the Germans have compensated Israel with large sums of money. "But when we try to buy weapons, (Western countries) are only willing to give us scrap metal left over from wars. Britain told us that it would take a year and a half to deliver Meteor jet aircraft. That is why we have to buy arms from the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia."

Quwatli added: "We buy weapons for self-defense. We do not want to turn Damascus into another Haifa (an Israeli port)." He said: "If it were not for Israel, we would be very willing to buy tractors instead of guns."

In the conversation, Quwatli also pointed out that the French Foreign Minister Pineau's claim that Syria has Soviet volunteers is a "fabrication."

    阿拉伯国家代表团联名致函哈马舍尔德
    要求以色列军队立即撤出埃及
    叙利亚总统指责西方国家援助以色列
    新华社21日讯　据法新社纽约20日讯：十一个阿拉伯国家代表团联名给联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德写了一封信，这封信要求以色列军队立即撤退到埃及和以色列的分界线后面去。
    这封信里提到有些新闻电讯说，以色列当局对加沙地区居民和巴勒斯坦阿拉伯难民已经采取了野蛮的行动。这封信指责以色列当局实行“暗杀，放逐，恐怖行动和威吓。”
    阿拉伯国家代表团要求哈马舍尔德促请联合国代表们注意这件事情。
    新华社21日讯　大马士革消息：叙利亚总统库阿特利11月20日对合众社记者说：西方国家给予以色列的武器、金钱和其他形式的支持已经严重地破坏了中东的均势。以色列经常利用西方的这种援助进攻阿拉伯邻国。
    库阿特利说，西方曾经给以色列人枪炮、法国的神秘式飞机以及美国的佩刀式喷气飞机和坦克，德国人还赔偿了以色列大量金钱。“而当我们设法购买武器的时候，（西方国家）愿意给我们的只是一些战争剩余废铁。英国告诉我们，必须经过一年半的时间才能交付流星式喷气飞机。这就是我们要从苏联和捷克斯洛伐克购买军火的道理。”
    库阿特利又说：“我们购买武器是为了自卫。我们不愿意使大马士革变成另一个海法（以色列港口）。”他说：“若不是由于以色列，我们本来很愿意购买拖拉机而不是购买枪炮的。”
    库阿特利在谈话中还指出法国外交部长比诺说叙利亚有苏联志愿人员一点是一种“捏造”。
