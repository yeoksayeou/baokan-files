On the night of the 19th, Eden announced after a cabinet meeting that he would be taking a "vacation" for three weeks. The news was released so suddenly that some morning newspapers published on the 20th did not even have time to print it. "The Times" also said that Eden's decision was "unexpected."

There can be various explanations for Eden's "vacation." Conservative newspapers are promoting the idea that the British Prime Minister is "overly fatigued": in the past two weeks, he has only been able to sleep five hours a night.

So, what is tormenting Eden, making him unable to sleep?

From Eden's "vacation," people naturally associate it with the series of problems Britain has encountered after the war of aggression against Egypt. The disastrous consequences of the war of aggression are now becoming increasingly evident to the British public. Among the 80,000 dockworkers nationwide, the number of unemployed has increased from 7,000 to 8,300 in just one week. If a British housewife was already paying one shilling and four pence more per pound of tea a week ago, then from today onwards, she will have to pay one penny more for each loaf of bread. Despite the very warm sun on Saturday, the number of Londoners going on excursions in their vehicles has decreased by two-thirds compared to the past. What will follow is that the rent for more than four million households will increase; oil rationing will be implemented from the 17th of next month...

This is just the beginning. The price of the war of aggression will be much greater than this. In the first ten days after the ceasefire, British newspapers launched a heated discussion: what exactly did Britain gain and lose from the Middle East war? Summarizing their opinions, we can draw up a list that is not even exhaustive:

    1. Three-quarters of the cheap oil (which supplied 70% of Britain's needs) previously coming from Arab countries has been cut off. Now, Britain must buy oil with US dollars, but this is far from meeting Britain's needs.

    2. This means that dollar reserves will decrease due to this additional expense. "Tribune" biweekly wrote: Macmillan sold "Trinidad Oil Company" in order to increase dollars, "but we now have neither dollars nor oil."

    3. This also means a reduction in foreign exchange, which was previously earned by selling Middle Eastern oil to Western European countries.

    4. Britain's oil reserves are only enough for two months. The lack of oil will have a serious impact on the industrial sector, as many British industrial sectors rely on oil as a fuel source.

    5. The result of reduced industrial production will lead to increased unemployment.

    6. The Suez Canal is closed, and it will be difficult to restore traffic within three or six months. Ships going to the East have gratuitously added five thousand miles to their journey by going around the Cape of Good Hope. This increases shipping costs and correspondingly reduces the number of transport ships.

    7. Britain's competitiveness in overseas markets will be weakened as a result. The "Daily Herald's" conclusion is: "We will make ourselves even more dependent on the United States."

How to solve these problems? The first major measure taken by some British political leaders after the ceasefire was to launch an anti-Soviet and anti-communist movement under the pretext of the Hungarian incident. However, this kind of trick can only poison the international situation; it will neither bring oil to Britain nor suppress mass dissatisfaction. Thus, an idea has emerged in the British ruling group: replace Eden. Eden's sudden "vacation" has already caused speculation in London: this may be a way to give him a dignified way to step down. However, regardless of whether Eden is on "long-term leave," if Britain wants to improve its current situation, it is important to change its policies, not its personnel.

    英国对侵略战争付出的代价
    本报驻伦敦记者　潘非
    19日午夜，艾登在内阁会议之后宣布，他将“休假”三星期。这个消息发布得如此仓促，在20日出版的某些晨报，甚至来不及刊载。“泰晤士报”也说，艾登的这一决定，是“没有预料到的”。
    对于艾登的“休假”，可以有各种各样的解释。保守党的报纸，宣传英国首相“疲劳过度”：最近两周以来，每晚上他只能睡五个小时。
    那么，又是什么折磨着艾登，使他不能安眠呢？
    从艾登的“休假”，人们很自然地联想到英国在侵埃战争后所碰到的一连串的问题。侵略战争的灾难性后果，现在是愈来愈明显地摆在英国公众的面前了。全国八万码头工人中，失业人数在短短的一星期内，由七千人增加到八千三百人。一个英国主妇如果在一星期以前已为每磅茶叶多付出一先令又四个便士，那么从今天起，她又要为每个面包多付出一个便士。尽管星期六的太阳非常和煦，去作郊游的伦敦人的车辆，已比过去减少了三分之二。接着要发生的是：四百多万户居民的房租将要提高；石油从下月17日起实行配给……
    这仅仅是一个开端。侵略战争的代价，将会比这大得多。在停火以后的最初十天中，英国的报纸展开了热烈的讨论：中东战争究竟使英国得到了什么，失掉了什么？归纳一下它们的意见，可以开列出一张并不算得完备的账单：
    一、过去来自阿拉伯国家的廉价石油（它供应了英国所需的70％）四分之三已被切断。现在，英国必须以美元来购买石油，但这远不能满足英国的需要。
    二、这意味着美元储备将因这一额外的耗费而减少。“论坛”双周刊写道：麦克米伦为了增加美元而卖掉了“特立尼达石油公司”，“但是我们现在既没有美元，也没有石油”。
    三、这也意味着外汇的减少，这些外汇过去是依靠把中东石油卖给西欧国家来赚取的。
    四、英国的石油储备只够两个月之用。石油的缺乏，将在工业部门中发生严重影响，因为英国不少工业部门，是以石油为动力燃料的。
    五、工业减产的结果，将使失业增加。
    六、苏伊士运河交通中断，三个月或六个月内难以恢复。到东方去的船只，由于绕道好望角而平白增加了五千英里的路程。这就使得运费增加，运输船只相应地减少。
    七、英国在海外市场上的竞争能力，将因而削弱。“每日先驱报”的结论是：“我们将使得自己更加依赖于美国了”。
    怎样解决这些问题呢？英国的一些政治领袖，在停火以后采取的第一个重大措施，是以匈牙利事件为借口，发动了一个反苏反共运动。但是，这类把戏只能毒化国际局势；它既不会为英国带来石油，更不会抑止群众的不满。于是，在英国统治集团中出现了这样一种想法：撤换艾登。艾登突然的“休假”，已在伦敦引起这样一种猜测：这可能是给他保全面子的下台办法。但是，不管艾登是否“长期休养”，英国如果想改善目前的处境，重要的是改变政策，而不是改变人事。　（伦敦29日专电）
