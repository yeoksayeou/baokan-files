      The Situation of the Leak Has Been Investigated
    Comrade Liu Xiangdong of the Leshan Intermediate People's Court in Sichuan Province writes: After reading the article "Cannot Investigate or Do Not Want to Investigate" published in your newspaper on August 3, I sincerely accept the Party newspaper's criticism of me. These criticisms are timely and correct.
    I had serious shortcomings in dealing with the investigation of the loss of some materials of confidential documents by relevant personnel of the Leshan Intermediate Court during the move in February of this year.
    After the Party newspaper's criticism, we conducted another inspection among the cadres, and repeatedly analyzed and studied the situation of this leakage and the reasons for the problem, further clarified the responsibilities, and finally reported it to the higher party and government leaders for separate handling.

      查清了失密情况
    四川省乐山中级人民法院刘祥东同志来信：读过你报8月3日刊载“查不清还是不查清”一文后，我衷心接受党报对我的批评，这些批评是及时的、正确的。
    我在对待追查乐山中级法院有关人员在今年2月搬家时遗失机密文件部分材料的问题上，存在着严重的缺点。
    党报批评以后，我们又在干部中进行了检查，对这次失密的情况和发生问题的原因反复进行了分析研究，进一步分清了责任，最后报请上级党政领导分别给予处理。
