Xinhua News Agency, November 18th: Over two hundred students from eight countries, who are recuperating at the Asian-African Student Sanatorium of the International Student Union in Beijing, gathered last night to celebrate International Students' Day. At the meeting, all participants adopted a telegram to the International Student Union, stating that we firmly believe that the ISU will make even greater contributions to promoting the unity, health, and welfare of young people and students around the world, as well as consolidating world peace.

The delegation from the International Student Union, currently visiting our country, also participated in the meeting. Iraqi student representative Hassan spoke at the meeting. He said, "I am very excited to spend International Students' Day here today, because the Asian-African Student Sanatorium itself is a manifestation of the great unity of students around the world." He thanked the Chinese students for accepting the ISU's commission to establish this sanatorium.

Wang Yangwen, Deputy Director of the Asian-African Student Sanatorium, spoke at the meeting. On behalf of all the staff of the sanatorium, he expressed his intention to work harder, strive to learn advanced medical technologies from all over the world, strengthen ties with the recuperating students, and work hard to improve the health of Asian and African students and enhance their friendship.

This sanatorium is located next to the beautiful Badachu scenic area in the suburbs of Beijing and was built by the All-China Students' Federation at the commission of the International Student Union. Since its opening on November 25, 1954, formerly named the Asian Student Sanatorium, it was renamed the Asian-African Student Sanatorium in August and September of this year according to the resolutions of the Fourth World Student Congress. In the past two years, the sanatorium has received a total of 796 students from nine countries, including India, Indonesia, Nepal, Pakistan, Iraq, North Korea, Vietnam, Mongolia, and China, of whom 574 have recovered and been discharged from the hospital.

    在亚非学生疗养院疗养的各国学生
    集会庆祝国际学生日
    新华社18日讯　在北京国际学生联合会亚非学生疗养院疗养的八个国家的二百多个学生，昨天晚上集会庆祝国际学生日。会上，全体参加者通过了致国际学生联合会的电报，电报里说，我们深信国际学联，今后会在促进全世界青年和学生的团结、健康、福利以及巩固世界和平等方面做出更大的贡献。
    正在我国访问的国际学联代表团也参加了这个会议。伊拉克学生代表哈桑在会上讲了话。他说，我今天在这里度过国际学生日，感到非常兴奋，因为亚非学生疗养院本身就是世界学生大团结的表现。他感谢中国学生接受国际学联的委托创办了这个疗养院。
    亚非学生疗养院副院长王仰文在会上讲了话。他代表全院职工表示要更加努力工作，努力学习世界各国的先进医疗技术，加强和休养员的联系，为提高亚非学生的健康水平、增进亚非学生的友谊而努力。
    这个疗养院位于北京郊区风景优美的八大处旁边，是国际学生联合会委托中华全国学生联合会建设的。疗养院从1954年11月25日开幕以来，原名亚洲学生疗养院，今年八、九月根据第四次世界学生代表大会决议改为亚非学生疗养院。两年来这个疗养院一共接受了印度、印度尼西亚、尼泊尔、巴基斯坦、伊拉克、朝鲜、越南、蒙古、中国等九个国家的七百九十六位学生来院疗养，其中已经病愈出院的有五百七十四人。
