Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, November 25th: The Indonesian government is taking legislative measures to nationalize privately held land and underground mineral resources. Privately held land refers to land privately enclosed or traded in the past by Dutch or other foreign nationals.

According to Antara News Agency, the Indonesian cabinet has submitted two bills, the "Law on Nationalizing Privately Held Land" and the "Mining Law," to Parliament for review.

The draft "Law on Nationalizing Privately Held Land" stipulates that from the time the law takes effect, all private management rights and ownership of privately held land will be abolished, and they will be recovered as state-owned land. The government will compensate the owners of these lands for their losses with cash and other means.

The bill also stipulates that if the original privately held land has been managed by Indonesian citizens, then the person with the right to manage will obtain ownership of these lands. Privately held land cultivated or managed in other ways by foreign nationals must be transferred to Indonesian citizens or the government within a one-year period.

The draft "Mining Law" stipulates that all underground mineral resources throughout Indonesia are owned by the state. However, mineral resources can be leased to joint public-private enterprises or private enterprises for development and operation under certain conditions.

The bill stipulates that these private enterprises must meet the following conditions: the enterprise must be established in accordance with Indonesian law and must be located in Indonesia; the managers and directors of the enterprise must be Indonesian citizens; if there are more than two managers and directors, the majority of them must be Indonesian citizens; in principle, all employees should be Indonesian citizens. The bill also stipulates that each enterprise unit can lease up to 100,000 hectares of land to develop one type of mineral. A special bill will be drafted separately regarding oil exploitation.

    印度尼西亚政府向国会提出法案
    准备收回外侨私领土地和矿藏
    新华社雅加达25日电　印度尼西亚政府正在采取立法措施，以便把私领土地和地下矿藏收归国有。私领土地是指荷兰人或其他外国侨民过去私自圈买或圈卖的土地。
    据安塔拉通讯社报道，印度尼西亚内阁已经把“私领土地收归国有法”和“矿业法”两项法案提交国会审查。
    “私领土地收归国有法”草案规定从这个法令生效的时候起，废除一切私领土地的私人管理权和所有权，收回它们作为国有土地。政府将以现款和其他方式来赔偿这些土地的领主的损失。
    这项法案还规定，原来的私领土地如果已经由印度尼西亚国民经营，那么，有经营权者将获得这些土地的所有权。由外国侨民耕种或以其他方式经营的私领土地，必须在一年期内转让给印度尼西亚国民或政府。
    “矿业法”草案规定印度尼西亚全境地下矿藏都属国家所有。但是矿产可以在一定的条件下租给公私合营的企业或私营企业来开发和经营。
    法案规定这些私营企业要具备下例条件：企业必须是按照印度尼西亚法律成立的，并且必须设在印度尼西亚国内，企业的经理和董事是印度尼西亚国民，经理和董事如果超过两人，其中多数是印度尼西亚国民，原则上全体雇员都应该是印度尼西亚国民。法案还规定每一个企业单位最多可以租借开发一种矿物的土地十万公顷。关于开采石油，将另外制订一个专门的法案。
