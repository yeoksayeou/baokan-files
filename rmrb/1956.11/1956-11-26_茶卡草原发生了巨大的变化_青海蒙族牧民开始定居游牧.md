    Huge Changes Have Taken Place on the Chaka Grassland
    Qinghai Mongolian Herdsmen Begin to Settle and Graze
    (Our newspaper dispatch) Qinghai Province's Chaka Grassland Mongolian herdsmen are transitioning from nomadic to settled grazing, from a single economy to a diversified economy. The lives of the herdsmen are gradually improving, and the days full of blood and tears are gradually becoming a historical relic.
    Before liberation, there were a total of 109 Mongolian households here. The economic form was a single nomadic economy. Most people lived a miserable life of wind and dew. In order to catch water and grass and avoid disasters, their yurts were moved every half month for long periods, and every day for short periods, even several times a day. In addition to paying taxes and livestock to the reactionary government, they had little contact with people from other places.
    Since liberation, tremendous changes have taken place in the Chaka Grassland. It has become a fortress on the Qinghai-Tibet and Qinghai-Xinjiang highways and the starting point of the Chaka-Gansu highway. It is also an important base for supporting the exploration and construction of the Qaidam Basin. The Chaka Salt Factory is a nationally famous salt-producing area. The long-term isolation of the Chaka Grassland from the outside world no longer exists. Brand new streets have appeared on the Chaka Grassland, cooperatives and joint state-private commercial enterprises have become active, and state-owned ranches and state-owned farms have also been established one after another. These have had a tremendous impact on changing the face of the Chaka Grassland. Thanks to the Party's leadership and support for local animal husbandry production, the old single nomadic economic form of the Chaka Grassland has undergone historical changes. Most of them have made two sets of yurts. The large yurt is their home, where the elderly and children live, and they live in a fixed place for a long time. The small yurt is used by young adults for grazing, and the whole family, both men and women, old and young, can often reunite. It is precisely this change in grazing form that has enabled them to engage in various sideline productions. This year, camels going out for transportation account for more than 80% of the camels with transportation capacity, and more than 50 laborers are engaged in various sideline productions. Crops have also appeared sporadically near the yurts. At the same time, among the existing 140 Mongolian herdsmen households, 134 have formed seven animal husbandry production mutual aid teams.
    The Mongolian herdsmen of the Chaka Grassland, from purely nomadic to nearly settled grazing, and from a single animal husbandry economy to engaging in diversified economies, have provided better conditions for the development of production and the improvement of the lives of herdsmen.

    茶卡草原发生了巨大的变化
    青海蒙族牧民开始定居游牧
    本报讯　青海省茶卡草原的蒙族牧民正在从游牧过渡到定居游牧，从单一的经济发展为多种经济，牧民生活正在逐步改善，那充满着血泪的日子已经逐渐成为历史上的陈迹。
    解放前，这里共有一百零九户蒙族牧民，经济形态是单一的游牧经济，大多数人都过着风餐露宿的悲惨日月，为了赶水草，躲灾害，他们的帐房长则半月一搬，短则一日一搬，甚至一天之内要搬几次，他们除了给反动政府交税纳畜外，和外地人民很少接触。
    解放以来，茶卡草原发生了巨大的变化，它成了青藏、青新公路的要塞和茶甘公路的起点，它也是支援柴达木盆地勘探和建设事业的一个重要据点，茶卡盐厂更是全国出名的产盐地。茶卡草原长期与外界隔离的情况不再存在了。茶卡草原上出现了崭新的街道，合作社和公私合营的商业活跃起来了，国营牧场、国营农场也相继建立，这些都对改变茶卡草原的面貌发生了巨大影响。由于党对当地畜牧业生产的领导和扶助，茶卡草原旧有的单一的游牧经济形态已经发生了历史性的变化。他们中大多数人都已制做了两套帐房，大帐房是他们的家，里面住着老人和娃娃，较长时期地固定在一个地方居住，小帐房供青壮年放牧使用，全家的男女老小都能经常得到团聚。正是这种放牧形式的改变，才使他们有条件经营各种副业生产。今年，出外搞运输的骆驼要占有运输能力的骆驼的80％以上，出外经营各种副业生产的劳动力有五十多名。帐房附近也零零星星地出现了农作物。同时，现有的一百四十户蒙族牧民中，已经有一百三十四户组成了七个畜牧业生产互助组。
    茶卡草原的蒙族牧民从纯粹游牧到接近定居游牧，从单一的畜牧经济开始经营多种经济，为生产的发展和牧民生活的改善提供了更好的条件。　（青海日报）
