Xinhua News Agency report: Mongolian, Chinese, and Soviet historians held a meeting in Ulaanbaatar on the 13th to discuss the issue of jointly compiling a history of Mongolia.

Chairman of the Mongolian Scientific Committee, Zhabuwaral, said at the meeting that the people of the three countries have close historical relations, and it is meaningful to cooperate in compiling a history of Mongolia. This marks the development and consolidation of friendship between the three countries.

Weng Dujian, Director of the Mongolian History Research Office of the Second Institute of History of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, thanked the Mongolian Scientific Committee for the invitation. He said that the cooperation of the three countries in compiling a history of Mongolia will not only make contributions in the scientific field, but will also enhance the friendship between the three countries and greatly help the study of the history of the three countries.

Soviet archaeologist Giselev, who had participated in the compilation of Mongolian history, welcomed the joint compilation of a more complete Mongolian history with Mongolian and Chinese historians. He also introduced relevant information.

The meeting began to discuss the plan for compiling the "General History of the Mongolian People's Republic" in three volumes under the chairmanship of Sirindib, First Deputy Prime Minister of the Mongolian Council of Ministers and historian.

Chinese and Soviet historians came to Ulaanbaatar at the invitation of the Mongolian Scientific Committee.

It is reported that Mongolian and Soviet historians previously cooperated in compiling a one-volume "General History of the Mongolian People's Republic." The Russian version was published in 1954, and the new Mongolian version was published in 1955. The Ethnic Publishing House of our country translated it into old Mongolian based on the new Mongolian version, and it has been published. The Second Institute of History of the Chinese Academy of Sciences is translating it into Chinese based on the Russian version, which is scheduled to be published next year. Now, historians from Mongolia, China, and the Soviet Union are preparing to cooperate in compiling the three-volume "General History of the Mongolian People's Republic."
