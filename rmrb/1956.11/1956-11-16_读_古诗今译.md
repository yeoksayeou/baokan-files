    Reading "Modern Translations of Ancient Poems"
    Lan Hong
    The purpose of "Modern Translations of Ancient Poems" is to help beginners improve their reading, appreciation, and language art skills through the study of classical literature. However, some recent "Modern Translations of Ancient Poems" are not satisfactory.
    The ninth issue of "Literary Study" this year published Comrade Gong Jimu's "Three Translations of Poems from the Book of Songs," which adopted a direct translation method to translate them into free verse. After reading it, I only want to discuss my thoughts on one of them, the folk song of the State of Wei - "Mang".
    The original translation is too long, so I will only excerpt a section as an example:
    The mulberry tree has not withered, its leaves are lush. Alas, little turtledove, do not eat mulberries! Alas, woman, do not be infatuated with men! When men are infatuated, they can still wake up; but when women are infatuated, they cannot easily wake up! (Original text: 桑之未落，其叶沃若。于嗟鸠兮，无食桑椹！于嗟女兮，无与士耽！士之耽兮，犹可说也；女之耽兮，不可说也。)
    From the perspective of word meaning interpretation, "耽" can be translated as "drunk," "immersed," or "infatuated." Here, translating it directly as "drunk" only makes the word meaning obscure and confusing. In fact, from the perspective of the central idea of the entire text, "Mang" is a poem about an abandoned woman. This section expresses the abandoned woman's feelings of regret and entanglement in her unfortunate marriage. Translating "耽" as immersed or infatuated with love would be more coherent.
    From the perspective of literary language structure and artistic style, the translation has not achieved the goal of revealing the so-called poetic mood with concise poetic language. Of course, it is also difficult to imagine that such a "demonstration translation" can improve the reader's language art skills.
    In addition, in the original work, the poet used the artistic techniques of "metaphor and allegory" to strengthen the poetic atmosphere of the original work, but in the translation, the sentences of "metaphor and allegory" were lightly passed over, and some even became dry and isolated things, making it difficult for people to understand their existence value. Taking the originally quoted translation as an example: the four lines of "The mulberry tree has not withered, ... do not eat mulberries" and the six lines of "Alas, woman, ... cannot easily wake up" have only become two groups of unrelated sentences that are勉强湊在一起. They have neither helped beginners solve the difficulties brought about by the language barrier caused by the distance of the times in reading classical literary works, nor have they played a role in rendering and strengthening the poetic atmosphere.
    "Modern Translations of Ancient Poems" is an arduous task, which requires painstaking intellectual labor. It is hoped that scholars engaged in the modern translation of classical literature can treat their translations more seriously.

    读“古诗今译”
    兰虹
    “古诗今译”的目的是为了帮助初学者通过学习古典文学作品，提高阅读、鉴赏能力和语言艺术修养。但是，最近有一些“古诗今译”，却不能令人满意。
    今年第九期的“文艺学习”刊载了龚棘木同志的一篇“诗经今译三首”，是采取直译的方法译成分行诗体的。读后，我只想就其中的一篇卫国民歌——“氓”的译文，谈谈自己的想法。
    原译文太长，只摘录其中一段为例：
    桑树未雕落，叶儿肥沃沃。哎呀斑鸠呵，不要吃桑椹。哎呀女人呵，不要醉男人，男人醉了呵，那还可以醒呵；女人醉了呵，那可不易醒呀。（原文：桑之未落，其叶沃若。于嗟鸠兮，无食桑椹！于嗟女兮，无与士耽！士之耽兮，犹可说也；女之耽兮，不可说也。）
    从词义的解释来看，“耽”本可作“醉”，“沉溺”“迷恋”之意，这里直译为“醉”，只能使词义晦涩。使人感到费解。其实，从全文的中心思想来看，“氓”是一首弃妇的诗，这一段是以弃妇的口吻道出了自己在不幸的婚姻遭遇中的悔恨交织的心情。“耽”译作沉溺迷恋于爱情的含义，是更能贯气一些的。
    从文词语言结构和艺术风格来看，译文根本没有做到以精练的诗的语言来透露所谓诗的意境，当然也很难想像到以这样的“示范译作”来提高读者的语言艺术修养。
    另外，在原作中诗人用“比、兴”的艺术手法加强了原作的诗的气氛，但是在译文中“比、兴”的语句被轻轻地带过去了，有的甚至成了枯涩、孤立的东西，很难令人领会到它的存在价值。仍以原引的译文为例：“桑树未雕落，……不要吃桑椹。”的四句与“哎呀女人呵，……那可不易醒呀。”的六句，只是成了勉强凑在一起的两组各不相干的句子，既没有帮助初学者解决在古典文学作品阅读中，由于时代距离而产生语言文字隔膜所带来的困难，也没有起到渲染加强诗的气氛的作用。
    “古诗今译”，是一件艰苦的工作，这就需要付出艰辛的思想劳动。希望从事古典文学今译工作的学者们能够更严肃一些对待自己的译文。
