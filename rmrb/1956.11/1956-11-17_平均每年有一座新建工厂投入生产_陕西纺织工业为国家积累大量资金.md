Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 16th. The six textile factories in Shaanxi under the Northwest Textile Bureau have accumulated funds for the state over the past seven years sufficient to build two new-style textile factories, each with 100,000 spindles and 3,200 looms.

	Starting in 1952, on the Qin Chuan Plain in Shaanxi, an average of one new textile factory was under construction each year, and an average of one newly built factory was put into production each year. After the newly built state-owned Shaanxi First and Second Cotton Textile Factories went into production in 1953, the funds turned over to the state treasury by the four state-owned and central-local joint state-private textile factories in the Shaanxi area that year increased by more than double compared to 1952. This year, because the state-owned Shaanxi Third and Fourth Cotton Textile Factories have also been put into production, it is estimated that the net profit accumulated for the state can increase by six and a half times compared to 1953. Currently, these four state-owned cotton textile factories built with state investment after liberation have recovered 97% of the total investment in the construction of the four factories. The state-owned Shaanxi First Cotton Textile Factory, which was put into production first, recovered all the state's investment in the factory in two years. The state-owned Shaanxi Second Cotton Textile Factory, because it had more looms than the First Factory, recovered all the investment in one and a half years after starting production.

	With the increase in accumulation, these textile factories obtain a certain proportion of the factory director's fund from the accumulation each year. Over the past seven years, the factory director's funds of each factory have totaled about two million yuan. These factory director's funds are all allocated by the state to each factory to reward the production achievements of textile workers. The factories used this fund to build housing for workers, run nurseries and kindergartens, improve employee meals and cultural and sports facilities, improve factory safety and health conditions, and reward employees who put forward rationalization proposals.

	The two central-local joint state-private textile factories—Shaanxi First and Second Cotton Textile Factories—have also increased production equipment with internal accumulation in recent years. Shaanxi Second Cotton Textile Factory built new factory buildings and added more than 8,000 spindles. Shaanxi First Cotton Textile Factory also added new machines and renovated old-style spinning frames.

    平均每年有一座新建工厂投入生产
    陕西纺织工业为国家积累大量资金
    新华社西安16日电　西北纺织管理局所属在陕西的六个纺织厂，七年来给国家积累的资金，可以用来建设两座各拥有十万纱锭和三千二百台布机的新型纺织厂。
    从1952年开始，在陕西秦川平原，平均每年都有一座新纺织厂施工，平均每年也有一座新建成的厂投入生产。解放后新建的国营陕西第一、第二棉纺织厂在1953年投入生产以后，当年陕西地区国营和中央公私合营的四个纺织厂缴给国库的资金，就比1952年增加了一倍多。今年，因为国营陕西第三、第四棉纺织厂也都投入生产，预计给国家积累的纯利，可以比1953年增加六倍半。现在，解放后国家投资建设的这四个国营棉纺织厂，已经收回了建设四个厂全部投资的97％。最先投入生产的国营陕西第一棉纺织厂，两年功夫便收回国家全部建厂资金，国营陕西第二棉纺织厂因为布机比一厂多一些，开工生产以后的一年半时间，便收回全部投资。
    这些纺织厂随着积累的增长，每年都在积累部分中获得一定比例的厂长基金。七年来各厂厂长基金共计有二百万元左右。这些厂长基金都是国家分配给各厂奖励纺织工人的生产成就的。各厂用这项基金为工人盖了住宅，举办托儿所和幼儿园，改善职工伙食和文化体育设备，改善工厂安全、卫生条件，以及奖励提出合理化建议的职工。
    两个中央公私合营的纺织厂——陕西第一第二棉纺织厂，在这几年中还用企业内部的积累增加了生产设备。陕西第二棉纺织厂新建了厂房，增添了八千多枚纱锭。陕西第一棉纺织厂也新添了机器和改造了旧式的细纱机。
