    Don't Let Children Wander the Streets Again
    By Our Correspondent Jin Yukun
    On the streets of Shenyang, it is common to see groups of children wandering the streets in droves. The older ones lead the younger ones, the bad ones lead the good ones. They are either fighting, cursing, climbing walls, chasing cars, or throwing stones and melon rinds at pedestrians and women.
    Children who wander the streets all day are extremely susceptible to being lured by hooligans and villains in society. Today, they give the children peanuts; tomorrow, they give them candy; the day after, they teach the children how to pick pockets. First, they ask you to keep watch, then to cooperate in "passing things," and finally, they ask the children to steal. According to a survey in Huanggu District, some scavengers who collect stolen goods under the guise of collecting scrap have dozens of children under their command who steal for them. Child thieves like Liu Xinchi and Zheng Gangyuan were once good students, but after being enticed and instigated by scavengers and habitual thieves, they eventually became habitual thieves themselves. A fourteen-member child theft gang cracked down on in Tiexi District was controlled and directed by old hooligans. This situation has become more serious in recent years. The Public Security Bureau has discovered more child thefts in the first seven months of this year than in the entire year of last year.
    There are two main reasons for this situation: first, the children have nowhere to go; second, they lack education.
    In the past, there were only 50,000 to 60,000 primary school students in Shenyang, but now there are more than 270,000. However, the number of schools and school buildings has increased very little, and there are not many cultural and recreational venues either. Among the city's several parks, only Zhongshan Park has a "Children's Paradise," and even this only "paradise" has few facilities. Although cinemas have "children's movie screenings," there are very few movies suitable for children. The city's only children's library is located in a dilapidated building, which could originally accommodate more than 500 people, but can now only accommodate about 200 people due to the building's hazardous condition. Most of the city's museums, cultural centers, and clubs are not open to children. They say, "Our task is to serve workers and peasants, and we are unable to take care of children." Only four of the eight cultural centers have attached children's reading rooms, and these are often occupied by exhibitions and other events. The city still does not have a "Children's Palace" or "Children's Home."
    In addition to the lack of activity venues that meet the needs of children, the issue of children's family education deserves serious attention. Especially among cadres, many people often use being busy with work as an excuse to adopt a laissez-faire attitude towards their children. A neighbor of a public security sub-bureau chief in Shenyang lost a plate of dumplings and more than ten yuan. The investigation revealed that the thief was none other than the chief's own son, a child in his teens. This child often stole things at home, but rarely received normal education from his parents. When angered, the chief would beat and scold the child, or even confine him. The deputy secretary of a factory's Party committee, the deputy director of a factory, and others in Tiexi District also lacked normal education for their children, leading some of them to develop thieving behavior.
    On the other hand, overly heavy workloads and too many meetings do indeed take up a lot of parents' time to handle housework and educate their children. Some workers in Tiexi District complained to teachers that they really wanted to understand their children's learning situation, but they and the children could not meet at both ends. What should they do? A school in Huanggu District had meetings almost every night. Once, a teacher wrote a note to the person chairing the meeting: "Please have pity on me, you must know that I am the mother of four children!" There have been repeated calls for an end to the encroachment on workers' other free time, but time for handling housework and educating children is still not guaranteed.
    In addition, there are also many problems in the current school education. Some teachers have the idea of only being responsible for inside the school and not outside, and valuing classroom teaching over extracurricular activities. Even educational administrative departments are not without this idea. They lack patient education for some "bad students" and often take simple and crude methods, such as recording demerits, suspending students, and expelling them to solve problems. As a result, some children lose confidence and cannot see their future, while others degenerate into thieves. Among the fourteen child thieves caught in Nan'an District, seven had become habitual thieves after being expelled from school.
    Educating and cultivating the second generation of the motherland is the responsibility of parents, the responsibility of teachers, and the common responsibility of society. All sectors of Shenyang should take measures to strengthen the education of children. The relevant departments should also quickly take in and educate the few child thieves who are currently wandering the streets, so that they can become good children through education and reform.

### 不要让孩子再在街头游荡

    不要让孩子再在街头游荡
    本报记者　金雨困
    在沈阳街头，经常可以看到孩子们成群结队在大街上流串游荡，大的带着小的、坏的带着好的，不是打架、骂人、爬墙、撵汽车，便是向行人和妇女丢石子和瓜皮之类。
    孩子整日游荡街头，极易为社会上的流氓坏蛋所勾引。他们今天给孩子吃点花生，明天给吃点糖果，后天就教孩子如何掏腰包。先要你放哨，后要配合“传东西”，最后就要孩子动手偷窃。据皇姑区调查，一些以收破烂为名的收赃贩，每人手下都有几十名儿童为其偷盗。童窃刘新池、郑刚元等过去都是很好的学生，因受收赃贩及惯窃的勾引唆使，日久也成了惯窃。铁西区破获的一个十四人的童窃集团，背后都受老流氓的控制和指挥。这种情况近年来更为严重，公安局今年七个月中发现的童窃比去年一年还多。
    造成这一情况的主要原因有两个，第一，孩子没有地方去，第二，对他们缺乏教育。
    在过去，沈阳市只有五、六万小学生，现在有二十七万多。但学校和校舍却增加极少，文化娱乐场所也不多。全市几个公园，只有中山公园设有“儿童乐园”，就是这唯一“乐园”的设备也不很多。电影院虽各有“儿童电影场”，但极少有适于儿童看的电影。全市唯一的一个儿童图书馆，设在一个破旧的楼房里，本来可容五百多人，现因楼房危险却只能容二百来人。全市的博物馆、文化馆和俱乐部大部不为儿童开放。他们说：“我们的任务是面向工农，要照顾儿童是无能为力的”。八个文化馆只有四个附设了儿童阅览室，而且还经常为展览会等占用。全市至今还没有一座“少年宫”或“少年之家”。
    除了缺乏满足儿童要求的活动场所外，值得引起严重注意的是儿童的家庭教育问题。特别在干部中间，许多人往往以工作忙为借口，对孩子采取了放任态度。沈阳市某公安分局局长的邻居失窃了，被窃去了一盘饺子和十多元钱。侦查结果，偷窃者不是旁人，而恰恰就是这位局长的儿子，一个十多岁的孩子。这个孩子平时在家也经常偷窃，但很少得到家长的正常教育。在气急时，这位局长就打、骂孩子一顿，甚至把他禁闭起来。铁西区某厂党委副书记、某厂副厂长等，同样对自己孩子缺乏正常教育，致使有的孩子已发展到有偷盗行为。
    另一方面，任务过繁、会议过多，也的确侵占了许多家长处理家务和教育子女的时间。铁西区有些职工向教师反映，我们也确实想经常了解孩子的学习情况，但和孩子们两头都不能见面，怎么办呢？皇姑区有一个学校几乎天天晚上有会，有一次一个教师就向主持会议的人写了一张条子：“请你可怜可怜我吧，你要知道，我是四个孩子的妈妈！”职工其它业余时间被侵占已屡有人为此呼吁，但是处理家务和教育子女的时间却仍得不到保证。
    另外，在目前的学校教育中也存在不少问题。有些教师存在只管校内不管校外，重视课堂轻视课外的思想。就是教育行政部门也并不是不存在这种思想的。对待一些“坏学生”缺乏耐心教育，往往采取了简单粗暴办法，以记过、停学、开除来解决问题。这样处理的结果，使一些孩子丧失了信心，看不见自己的前途，有些则堕落为盗。南市区捉到的十四名童窃中，就有七名是被学校开除后堕为惯窃的。
    教育和培养祖国的第二代，是家长的责任，也是教师的责任，更是社会的共同责任。沈阳市各界应当采取措施，加强对儿童的教育工作。对目前流浪街头的少数童窃，有关部门也应该迅速把他们收容起来予以教养，使他们在教育改造中成为好儿童。
