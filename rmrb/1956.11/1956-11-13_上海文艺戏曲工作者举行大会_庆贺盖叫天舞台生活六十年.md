Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, November 11th. Renowned Peking Opera performing artist Gai Jiaotian, today at the commemorative meeting celebrating Mr. Gai Jiaotian's sixty years on stage, attended by over nine hundred literary and art opera workers in Shanghai, gloriously accepted the honorary certificate awarded to him by the Ministry of Culture.

Tian Han, Director of the Art Affairs Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Culture, who came to Shanghai to participate in the commemorative meeting, delivered a speech on behalf of the Ministry of Culture at the meeting and presented the award certificate to Gai Jiaotian. Tian Han said: Following the commemorative meeting held last year in Beijing for Mr. Mei Lanfang and Mr. Zhou Xinfang's fifty years on stage, today we are commemorating Mr. Gai Jiaotian's sixty years on stage in Shanghai. This demonstrates that the motherland's opera art, with its long tradition, has produced countless outstanding veteran warriors. Their diligent and talented creations are increasingly supported and healthily developed in the people's era, and their contributions and experience are fully recognized.

Tian Han pointed out that commemorating Mr. Gai Jiaotian's sixty years on stage, we should learn from his unwavering will to love art and dedicate his life to it; learn from his spirit of constantly and tirelessly studying and practicing, continuously observing life, and creating characters with emotion and personality; and learn from his spirit of maintaining national integrity.

Ouyang Yuqian, Vice Chairman of the Chinese Dramatists Association, who has known Gai Jiaotian for over thirty years and has performed on the same stage with him, delivered a report at the meeting.

Jin Zhonghua, Deputy Mayor of Shanghai, on behalf of the people of Shanghai, expressed warm congratulations to Gai Jiaotian for his sixty years of artistic activity. He said: Gai Jiaotian inherited and carried forward the excellent tradition of realism in Chinese drama art. The various heroic figures he created on stage demonstrated the Chinese people's love of labor, optimistic and righteous character, and patriotic spirit, and therefore won the love of the people.

Xiong Foxi and Yu Zhenfei delivered congratulatory speeches at the meeting on behalf of the literary and art circles and the opera circles.

After accepting the honorary certificate, Gai Jiaotian said excitedly: My parents gave birth to me, but it is the Communist Party that understands us. Although I am seventy years old this year, I want to study together with everyone like a seven or eight-year-old child, dedicate my art to the motherland without reservation, cultivate the next generation, and serve the socialist construction of the motherland.

Many art units in Shanghai presented gifts and flowers to Gai Jiaotian. Mei Lanfang and many art units across the country sent congratulatory letters and telegrams.

The Ministry of Culture and the Chinese Dramatists Association held a banquet in Shanghai today at noon to congratulate Gai Jiaotian on his sixty years of stage life. Among those attending the banquet were Tian Han, Ouyang Yuqian, Jin Zhonghua, and nearly one hundred famous actors and veteran artists from various opera genres in Shanghai.

In the evening, Gai Jiaotian performed his signature plays "Happy Forest" and "Mandarin Duck Tower."
