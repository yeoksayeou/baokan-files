Xinhua News Agency, Berlin Telegram: West German newspapers reported that the final results of the local elections held in Rhineland-Palatinate on the 11th have been published. The Christian Democratic Union of Adenauer's party saw its vote share decrease from 52.1% in 1953 to the current 41.1%. Two weeks prior, the party also suffered similar defeats in the state elections of North Rhine-Westphalia, Hesse, and Lower Saxony. Meanwhile, the Social Democratic Party, campaigning with the slogan "Oppose conscription and demand a change in Bonn's policies," increased its vote share from 27.2% in 1953 to the current 39.5%.

The results of the local elections held on the same day in Baden-Württemberg have not yet been published.

The "Social Democratic News Bulletin" published in Bonn on the 12th published a commentary stating: "The decisive significance of the election results in Rhineland-Palatinate is that the Christian Democratic Union can no longer maintain the absolute leading position it achieved in past elections."

    阿登纳集团不得人心
    在州选举中接连失败
    据新华社柏林电　西德报纸报道：莱因兰—普法尔茨州11日举行地方选举的最后结果已经发表。阿登纳的基督教民主联盟所得到的选票从1953年的52.1％减少到现在的41.1％。两个星期以前，这个政党在北莱因—威斯特伐利亚、黑森和下萨克森的州选举中也遭到同样的失败。而以“反对征兵和要求改变波恩的政策”为竞选口号的社会民主党所获得的选票从1953年的27.2％增加到现在的39.5％。
    同一天举行的巴登—瓦登堡州地方选举的结果到现在还没有发表。
    波恩出版的“社会民主新闻公报”12日发表评论说：“莱因兰—普法尔茨州的选举结果有决定意义的是：基督教民主联盟从过去的选举中所取得的绝对的首要地位再也保持不住了。”
