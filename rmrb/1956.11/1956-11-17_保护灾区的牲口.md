    Protecting Livestock in Disaster Areas
    Many agricultural cooperatives in the disaster area of Wuqiang County, Hebei Province, neglect the feeding and management of livestock. Feeding is not on time, feed is not clean, and livestock are even left to starve and drink foul-smelling water. Now, several hundred head of livestock have died, and many are sick and not being treated. This not only causes great difficulties for agricultural production, but also affects sideline production. It is hoped that the leading organs of Wuqiang County will take effective measures to help agricultural cooperatives improve the feeding and management of livestock and do a good job in preventing and controlling livestock diseases.

    保护灾区的牲口
    河北省武强县灾区许多农业社忽视牲畜的饲养管理。饲养不按时，饲料不清洁，甚至让牲畜挨饿和喝臭气冲鼻的水。现在，牲口已经死了好几百头，不少牲畜病了，也不给医治。这样不仅给农业生产造成很大困难，同时也影响到副业生产。希望武强县领导机关采取有效措施帮助农业社改善对牲畜的饲养管理，并且做好牲畜病疫防治工作。
