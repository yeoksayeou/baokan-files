Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, 4th TASS dispatch: This morning, the reactionary conspiratorial forces against the Hungarian people were crushed. A new Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government, headed by Prime Minister János Kádár, has been established. The new government calls on the Hungarian people to unite their forces to defend the achievements of the people's democratic system and to thoroughly smash the reactionary conspirators headed by Horthy officers who served in the Hitler army.

The Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government requested the Soviet military command to cooperate in suppressing the insurgents who, in recent days, were sheltered by the remnants of the Imre Nagy government, which disintegrated due to the withdrawal of honest Hungarian patriots.

The counter-revolutionary bandits entrenched in public buildings have been successfully suppressed and have surrendered. All honest patriots in Budapest and other parts of Hungary are actively participating in the struggle to disarm the insurgents and clear out the remaining nests of fascist groups.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 4th: According to an announcement by the Szolnok (southeast of Budapest) radio station, a new government in Hungary—the Hungarian Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government—was proclaimed on November 4th.

The Hungarian Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government, headed by János Kádár, the former First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Working People's Party, issued a "Letter to the Hungarian People."

The statement pointed out that the establishment of the new government is due to the increasing dominance of counter-revolutionaries in Hungary, which endangers the socialist achievements of the Hungarian people and the survival of the entire country.

The new government calls on the people of Hungary to defend the workers' and peasants' regime and the achievements of people's democracy, to restore order in the country, and to establish security and tranquility. The new government has also put forward a fifteen-point program.

The statement also announced that for the sake of the Hungarian people, the working class, and the interests of the country, the Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government requested the Soviet military command to help stop the reactionary and counter-revolutionary dark forces, restore the people's socialist system, and restore order and tranquility in Hungary.

The announced members of the new government are as follows: Prime Minister János Kádár. Other members of the government include: Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Armed Forces and Public Security Ferenc Münnich, Minister of State György Marosán, Minister of Foreign Affairs Imre Horváth, Minister of Finance István Kossa, Minister of Heavy Industry Antal Apró, Minister of Agriculture Imre Dögei, Minister of Trade Sándor Rónai.

The new government also announced that it will absorb representatives of other parties that support the socialist system and non-party members to participate.
