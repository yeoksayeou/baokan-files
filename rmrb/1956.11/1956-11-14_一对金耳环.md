    A Pair of Gold Earrings
    The day after the Mid-Autumn Festival, Sister-in-law Jinlian returned from her mother's house with a beaming smile. She wore a pair of pure gold earrings, weighing over one qian and three fen each, making her look particularly radiant. The villagers congratulated her and playfully said, "Sister-in-law Jinlian has really changed! Wearing those pure gold earrings, you look several years younger!"
    Why did Sister-in-law Jinlian start wearing gold earrings? It turned out like this: Before liberation, Jinlian relied on working for landlords to make a living. Although she was busy all year round, she often ended up with only enough coarse food to last half the year. At that time, when she saw others wearing gold earrings, she always blamed herself for having "bad luck" and "little fortune," and she would say to herself, "I wonder when I can dig up the roots of poverty and wear gold earrings too!"
    After liberation, Jinlian's family's life improved year by year. Especially after joining the Xiluo Advanced Agricultural Cooperative in Dinghu Township, An'yi County, Jiangxi Province, this spring, life became even better. All five members of her family participated in the cooperative's labor. In the summer harvest pre-distribution, they received more than 1,000 jin of food grain and 89 yuan in cash. The autumn harvest distribution list announced before the Mid-Autumn Festival also announced that her family would receive 3,300 jin of grain and 220 yuan in cash. This made Jinlian's family overjoyed.
    Seeing that this year's income had increased so much, Jinlian thought of her long-held desire to wear gold earrings. Coincidentally, before she could even say it, her son seemed to have guessed his mother's thoughts and said, "Mom has suffered all her life and never worn gold earrings. Now that income has increased after joining the cooperative, we must buy her a pair." As soon as her son finished speaking, the whole family agreed. At this moment, Jinlian was so happy that she could hardly speak. She never thought that her decades-long dream would come true in the first year after advanced cooperativization.

    一对金耳环
    中秋节的第二天，金莲嫂满面笑容地从娘家回来了。她的耳朵上戴着一对足有一钱三分重的赤金耳环，显得格外精神。村里的人们，一面向她表示祝贺，一面打趣地说：“金莲嫂可真变了样，戴上赤金耳环，人都年轻了好几岁！”
    为什么金莲嫂戴起金耳环呢？原来是这样一回事：在解放以前，金莲嫂总是靠给地主帮工来维持生活。她虽然一年忙到头，常常是落个糠菜半年粮。当时，她看见人家戴上了金耳环，总是怨自己“命薄”、“福浅”，并自言自语地说：“不晓得几时才能挖掉穷根，也能戴上金耳环！”
    解放以后，金莲嫂家的生活一年比一年好起来了。尤其是在今年春季加入江西安义县鼎湖乡西洛高级农业社后，日子就过得更好了。她全家五口人，个个都参加了社的劳动。在夏收预分中，分到了一千多斤口粮和八十九元现款。中秋节前公布的秋收分配榜上，又宣布了她家除能分到三千三百斤粮食外，还能分到二百二十元钱。这一下，可把金莲嫂一家乐坏了。
    金莲嫂看到今年的收入增加了这么多，便想起了戴金耳环这桩心事来。巧得很，还没有等她说出口来，儿子好像猜到了妈妈的心事似的说：“妈吃了一辈子苦，没有戴过金耳环，入社后收入增多了，可得给她买一对。”儿子的话音刚落，就得到了全家的同意。这时，金莲嫂快活的简直说不出话来。她没有想到几十年的梦想，在高级合作化后的第一年就实现了。
