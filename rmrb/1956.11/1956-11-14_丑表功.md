    Shameless Boasting

    There is a Chinese saying: "Lay down the butcher's knife and become a Buddha on the spot." It means that a person who has done bad things can become a good person as long as they repent and turn over a new leaf. But there are some people who have not put down the bloody butcher's knife in their hands, but are already boasting that they are compassionate "Buddhas." Such people, of course, can never become "Buddhas."

    British Prime Minister Eden is such a person. Britain and France have started a war in the Middle East, and now the embers have not died out, and the British and French aggressor troops are still entrenched on Egyptian soil, but Eden is already busy shamelessly boasting, proclaiming that his aggression is "meritorious." According to him, if Britain and France had not invaded Egypt, "the entire Middle East would be in the midst of war today."

    Eden can certainly blow himself up as swollen as he likes, but he can't cover other people's mouths. The British "Tribune" weekly published an article by Michael Foot on November 2, with the banner headline: "Intimidation, Lying, Hypocrisy—Then Send in the Bombers: Eden and Mollet Commit Crimes Against the World."

    There is a reason for Eden's shameless boasting. The invasion of Egypt was unsuccessful, and Britain and France themselves fell into a mud pit from which they could not pull their feet out. The editorial of the "Daily Mirror" on November 6 wrote: Eden waged war saying it was to "keep the canal open," "but the canal is now blocked," "the supply of oil from Arab countries has been interrupted"... News from Paris said that the French government has issued a new decision to restrict oil consumption, and the oil supply for many industrial sectors in France is only enough for four or five weeks. Since November 10, France has stopped producing "special" gas. Under these circumstances, Eden and his ilk have to use shameless boasting to try to maintain their position. This is called: He who commits many unrighteous acts is doomed.

### 丑表功

    丑表功
    中国有句俗话说：“放下屠刀，立地成佛”。意思是说，干了坏事的人只要悔过自新，痛改前非，就能变成好人。但是有这么一种人，他手里血淋淋的屠刀并没有放下，却已经自吹是大慈大悲的“佛”了。这种人当然是永远也成不了“佛”的。
    英国首相艾登就是这种人。英、法在中东烧起了战火，现在余烬未熄，英、法侵略军还盘踞在埃及土地上，可是艾登却已经在忙着丑表功，宣扬自己侵略有“功”。据他说，如果英、法不去侵略埃及，“今天整个中东将处在战火之中”。
    艾登当然可以把自己吹得又肿又胀，可是，别人的嘴他却掩不住。11月2日的英国“论坛”周报上刊载了迈克尔·福特一篇论文，用的通栏标题是：“恫吓、说谎、伪善——然后派轰炸机轰炸，艾登和摩勒犯了反对全世界的罪行。”
    艾登要给自己丑表功，并不是没有道理的。侵略埃及没有成功，英、法自己倒掉进了拔不出脚来的泥坑。11月6日“每日镜报”的社论写道：艾登进行战争说是为了“使运河开放”，“可是运河现在已经被阻塞了”，“阿拉伯国家石油的供应已经中断”……。从巴黎传来的消息说，法国政府已颁布了一项限制石油用量的新决定，法国许多工业部门的用油只够供应四、五个星期。从11月10日起，法国已经停止生产“特制”煤气。在这种情况下，艾登之流不得不用丑表功为保住自己的地位而努力了。这就叫做：自作孽，不可活。
