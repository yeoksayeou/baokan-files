    In Commemoration of the Ninetieth Anniversary of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Birth: Four Poems in Seven-Character Verse
    Wang Baozhen
    I
    The banyan shade of Xiangshan, Cuheng Village,
    Birthed a hero revered by generations.
    The first sound of revolution shook China,
    A clever plan saved him from peril in London.
    He studied myriad books to research the truth,
    And first chose the Three Principles of the People for public discussion.
    "The world is for all" remains in his writing,
    We should further reflect on his policies.
    II
    Hatred for national enemies and traitors was hard to quell,
    The South China Sea's winds and clouds were repeatedly shocked.
    Overseas Chinese of the islands admired his great righteousness,
    Scholars of Japan looked up to his heroic reputation.
    People's rights and national history unprecedented,
    A pioneer and visionary enlightened future generations.
    Land should belong to those who till it,
    Comrades encouraged each other, forming alliances.
    III
    Iron and blood flowers bloomed everywhere,
    The Chinese revival began with the revolutionary army.
    The five races of the Republic are all equal,
    The Three Chapters of the Provisional Constitution prevented dictatorship.
    The light of day is admired by all,
    The people's suffering in chaotic times is lamentable.
    Evil influences swept away, his heroic spirit remains,
    We should drink a few cups towards Biyun Temple.
    IV
    Renewing policies to aid farmers and workers,
    For forty years, striving for a great harmony.
    Learning from Soviet Russia, leaving behind instructions,
    Welcoming the success of communism.
    The moonlight and clear sky shine white for a thousand autumns,
    The revolutionary flag flutters red for ten thousand years.
    He once urged peaceful salvation of China,
    His last words call to the east of the sea once more.

    孙中山先生九十周年诞辰纪念敬赠七律四章
    王葆真
    一
    香山榕荫翠亨村，诞降英贤百世尊。革命先声开震旦，临危奇计释伦敦。曾翻万卷研真理，始选三民与众论。天下为公遗墨在，应将政策更重温。
    二
    国仇民贼恨难平，南海风云几震惊。群岛侨胞钦大义，扶桑学士仰英声。民权民族空前史，先觉先知启后生。田地均为耕者有，朋侪鼓舞结同盟。
    三
    铁血黄花遍地开，中华兴起革军来。共和五族皆平等，约法三章防独裁。天日光明人尽仰，国民离乱世堪哀。妖氛扫净英风在，应向碧云饮几杯。
    四
    翻新政策助农工，四十年间为大同。师法苏俄垂训语，欢迎共产告成功。流光月霁千秋白，革命旗飘万岁红。曾嘱和平救中国，遗言重唤海云东。
