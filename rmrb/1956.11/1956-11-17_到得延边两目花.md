    The train from Changchun to Tumen River is scheduled perfectly. It departs at dawn and arrives at dusk, giving passengers a whole day to fully enjoy the scenery. And this is no ordinary enjoyment. I haven't seen the scenery of Guilin, which is said to be the best in the world, but I firmly believe that the scenery along this thousand-mile journey is truly enchanting. I was embarking on this trip for a temporary assignment to the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture. I had no prior impression of Yanbian. Three years ago, I had been to many remote areas in northern Manchuria, but I didn't include Yanbian in my itinerary at that time. Therefore, although I felt a sense of novelty about this sudden action, I wasn't exactly impatient. However, who would have thought that after I transferred to the train to Yanbian from Changchun, I would become so uncontrollably flustered and amazed that I would mutter and babble to my companions.

    I was intoxicated with happy confusion. I had seen the plains of northern Manchuria, but I never expected to see such endless fertile land here; I had been to the Lesser Khingan Mountains, but I didn't know that the remaining peaks of Changbai Mountain could be so undulating and vibrantly green. And the sea of trees in the Yichun Forest had once given me long-term reverie; but only this time, when the train spiraled around the magnificent Harba Ridge, and I could hardly find tree trunks or branches among the trees in the depression next to the ridge, only seeing layers of dense, closely intertwined lush green leaves, woven into a vast and boundless spectacle rising and falling in the wind – only then did I truly realize what a real sea of trees was. Moreover, the Yichun forest area is still sparsely populated; but here, the green mountains and trees closely protect the grain fields, railways, and the smoke from the many busy cities. When the train passed through Jilin City and the Songhua River, I thought of my hometown, the shores of Dongting Lake and the banks of the Xiang River. There are not as many shuttling boats in the southern water towns here, but there are also terraced rice fields; as for the unique vast wilderness here, it is already full of construction sites where workers are working hard like stars, and countless factories and tree-like chimneys that will be connected into large areas. And in all of this, the ever-busy laborers of both Han and Korean nationalities, and the Korean women in white dresses and skirts carrying bundles and children on their backs, added even more meaningful colors to the surrounding mountains and rivers. I want to call on everyone to quickly change the old traditional concept of "only the beautiful Jiangnan." I heard that the grand gathering of mountains, rivers, and people inspires poets to write like a spring, but this has nothing to do with me, a fool who has hardly ever been exposed to poetry. However, who would have thought that on this journey, I would unexpectedly encounter a miraculous inspiration bestowed by heaven and actually spit out a regulated verse, even though it was a disgrace to the seriousness of poetry:

    First time to Yanbian in my life,
    Endless freshness fills my sight:
    A touch of grain fields praising North Manchuria,
    Thousands of factories shaking the wilderness;
    Remaining peaks of Changbai surge like waves,
    Birch forest depths, the sound of sea tides roar.
    Han and Korean children, true sons and daughters,
    Hand in hand, building a paradise on earth.

    The poem was finished, and the train continued to rumble forward. And having just circled around the Harba Ridge, the endless scenery suddenly became even more intense. We saw denser rice fields, and the crops in the fields were extraordinarily lush. The houses by the fields were full of heated kang beds; colorful skirts woven into dances flashed in the villages from time to time, conveying strong and lingering songs. I was surprised, and only learned from others that this was officially entering the Yanbian Autonomous Prefecture, and learned that the Korean farmers are all rice-growing experts, and learned many famous historical stories about the Northeast Anti-Japanese Allied Army composed of Korean and Han people active in the nearby mountains. Once again, I couldn't control myself, and my heart beat faster than the speed of the train. Thus, another flying regulated verse blurted out:

    I was surprised even before arriving in Yanbian,
    Arriving in Yanbian, my eyes are dazzled.
    The beautiful rice fields are unparalleled,
    Heroic stories are all over the cliffs;
    Dances in every village condense into pearls and jade,
    Songs everywhere surround the colorful clouds.
    Korean people are all good men,
    Their inexhaustible light shines on China.

    Seeing that we were about to arrive in Yanji City, where the autonomous prefecture government is located. I sorted out my thoughts and calmed down a bit. Thinking about how I could have produced so-called regulated verses, I inadvertently heard my companions talking happily about the prosperity of Yanji. While listening, I realized that it was not that I could write poetry! It's just because I set foot on a land where there is poetry everywhere, and the leisurely journey gave me a ridiculous naiveté... Isn't that so! When I arrived in Yanji and was able to see everything around me more calmly, I was dazzled. Seeing that this small city in my imagination had a very modern medium-sized city scale, seeing so many buildings under construction in all directions, and the light railways laid in the city for the construction sites, I couldn't help but stand there dumbfounded for a long time at any time. The rice threshers produced by the Yanbian Agricultural Machinery Factory here are busy supplying ten provinces including Guangdong and Yunnan, the famous rice-producing regions; and at the handicraft exhibition being held here, the distinctive samples are even more beautiful. On the streets, national costumes, suits, cheongsams, cadre uniforms, and various novel styles of clothing shine brightly, truly dazzling, and give people an example of clothing not being a problem. There are also many Han people in the city, and they are as close as family members to their Korean compatriots, and they can almost speak each other's languages... My chest was filled with excitement, and I was immersed in the boundless sea of poetry. I understand that these are truly the days when poetry is needed, not the moments on the train when I can scribble at will; however, I am ultimately not destined for poetry, and I can't dig out a single sentence in this situation. I want to ask the poets not to let go of Yanbian, not to let go of this vast sea of poetry and land of poetry. I know that the poets of Yanbian have already written and are writing beautiful works; but, shouldn't poets from other regions also strive to gain the glory of singing about Yanbian!

    到得延边两目花
    康濯
    一
    从长春开往图们江的火车，车行的时间安排得真是太好。天刚亮发车，天刚黑到达；整整一个白天，给予了旅客们尽情观赏风土山川的幸福。并且这还不是一般的幸福。我没有见过桂林的山水是怎样地甲天下，我却要坚决肯定这儿千里长途中的景色实在迷人。我是为了一个临时任务而奔上这段旅途，去往延边朝鲜族自治州的。我对延边没有过任何印象。三年前，我去过北满的许多边远之地，当时也没把延边计入旅程。因而我对这一次的突然行动虽然感到新奇，却也并非迫不及待。可是，谁能想到当我从长春换上去延边的火车以后，我竟会变成那样不能抑制地张惶无主，以至于惊讶得和同行者念念有词地碎嘴乱说起来。
    我是陶醉在幸福的慌乱之中。我见过北满平原，却没有想到这里也会有望不到头的米粮宝地；我到过小兴安岭，却不知道这里长白山的余峰是那样波涛起伏和翠色逼人。而伊春森林的树海曾经给了我长远的遐思；但是，只有这一次当火车九曲连环地盘绕上奇伟的哈尔巴岭，从那岭旁洼地内的树群当中简直找不着树干树枝，唯独看到层层密密紧相依偎的葱笼绿叶，织成了一片迷茫无际的奇景在风中起伏浮动——我这才第一次恍然大悟到真个的树海。并且，那伊春林区暂时还是人烟稀少；但这里的绿山碧树，却团团护卫着粮川、铁路和众多的繁忙城市的炊烟。当火车走过吉林市和松花江，我想起了我的家乡洞庭湖滨和湘江两岸。这里没有南方水乡之中那么多往来如梭的船只，但也有着参差的稻地；至于这里特有的辽阔荒原之上，却已满布着如繁星一样的工人在紧张活动的工地，以及将要联成大片的无数工厂和树列似的烟囱。而在这一切景象之中，那往来无间的汉族朝鲜族两族劳动者，和顶包袱、背小孩的白衣长裙的朝鲜族妇女，又更给远近山川平添了许多意味深长的色彩。我要呼吁大家赶快改变“唯有锦绣江南”的旧的传统观念。我听说山川人物之盛会引发诗人们泉涌一般的吟诵，但这却与我这个几乎从没接触过诗的笨蛋无关。然而，谁能料到就在这一段旅途，我竟也瞎碰到了天外赐来的奇兴，居然吐出了一首尽管有辱诗的严肃的律诗：
    平生首次去延边，无限新鲜入眼帘：一抹粮川夸北满，万千工厂震荒原；长白余峰波浪涌，桦林深处海潮喧。汉朝两族真儿女，手执山川建乐园。
    诗成，火车依然在轰轰前进。而刚刚绕行过哈尔巴岭，那不尽的风光突然又更为浓烈起来。但见稻田更密，田中的庄稼茂盛的出奇。田边房屋里尽是地炕；村庄内不时闪现着彩裙织成的舞蹈，传送出健壮缭绕的歌声。我正在惊讶，从旁人的口中方知道这才正式进入延边自治州，并知道了朝鲜族农民个个都是种稻能手，知道了朝鲜族汉族人民组成的东北抗日联军在附近山中活动的许多有名的历史故事。我再一次地不能自制，心跳得比车行的速度还高。于是，又一首飞来的律诗冲口而出：
    延边未到已惊讶，到得延边两目花。锦绣稻田无匹敌，英雄史迹遍山崖；村村舞蹈凝珠玉，处处歌音绕彩霞。朝鲜族人皆好汉，光芒不尽照中华。
    眼看就要到达自治州政府所在地延吉市。我理了理思绪，安静一些。想到自己怎么竟会作出所谓律诗，无意中又听见同行者在欢谈着延吉的盛况。我一边听，一边却领悟到哪里是什么我会作诗！只不过因为我踏上了无处无诗的土地，而闲暇的旅途生活又给了我以可笑的天真……可不是么！当我到了延吉，能够比较冷静地看清周围一切的时候，我竟是心花缭乱。我看到这个想像中的小城市竟有着很为现代化的中等城市规模，看到四面八方正在兴工的那么些建筑，和为了工地而在市内铺设的轻便铁道，不禁随时都要呆若木鸡地久久站立。这里延边农具厂出产的打稻机，正在忙不胜忙地供应着著名稻米之乡的广东、云南等十个省；而在这里正举行着的手工业品展览会上，那特色鲜明的样品更是美不胜收。街头上民族服、西服、旗袍、干部服和各种新颖样式的衣着交相辉映，真是满目琳琅，并给人提出了一个服装不成为问题的榜样。市内汉人也不少，他们和朝鲜族同胞互相间如家人一样地亲近，差不多都能说出对方的语言……我胸头塞满激动，我沉迷在无边的诗海之中。我懂得这才真是需要吟诗的日子，而不是火车上可以任我胡诌的时刻；然而，我到底和诗绝无缘分，这光景竟至一句都挖不出来。我要请求诗人们别放过延边，别放过这一块辽阔的诗海和诗的陆地。我知道，延边的诗人已经写出了和正在写出美丽的作品；但是，其它地区的诗人，难道不也应该去争取获得歌唱延边的光荣么！（第一节完，待续）
