    Editor's Note: Yesterday morning, the Preparatory Committee for the 90th Anniversary of the Birth of Mr. Sun Yat-sen and the Study Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference held a report meeting, inviting Wu Yuzhang, President of the Socialist Academy, to report on Mr. Sun Yat-sen's great revolutionary spirit. The attendees included members of the Preparatory Committee for the 90th Anniversary of the Birth of Mr. Sun Yat-sen, Vice-Chairmen, Standing Committee members, and members of the Study Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, students of the Socialist Academy, and leaders of various democratic parties and people's organizations. More than 400 Soviet experts in Beijing were also invited to attend the report meeting. The following is the full text of Wu Yuzhang's report.

    There is an old Chinese saying: "A wise man adapts to the times." By "times," we can call it the historical trend, the objective development trend. As a revolutionary, one should and can only correctly lead the masses and promote historical progress based on the objective laws of historical development. Therefore, understanding the "times" is the most important talent and the most valuable quality of a revolutionary. Mr. Sun Yat-sen was a great revolutionary who was good at understanding the "times," adapting to historical development, and constantly progressing. He often said that he wanted to enlighten those who knew later with his prior knowledge, and enlighten those who awoke later with his prior awakening, which proves that he deeply understood this principle. Therefore, his words and propositions often walked ahead of the people.

    The historical development of modern China was very rapid, and many people stumbled because they could not correctly recognize the objective situation. Before the Reform Movement of 1898, many patriotic reformers hoped to learn from the reforms of Peter the Great of Russia and the Meiji Restoration of Japan, demanding reform from top to bottom. At that time, this was a progressive trend of thought. The reformers once played a significant enlightening role among the progressive youth at the time and were regarded as a scourge by the ruling class. Some of the reformers also waged heroic struggles. The spirit of people like Tan Sitong, who sacrificed their lives for righteousness, is especially admirable. However, after the failure of the Reform Movement of 1898, many reformers rose up against the revolution and became people who did not understand the times. During the period from 1900 to the Xinhai Revolution of 1911, many enthusiastic revolutionaries bravely joined the battle under the call to overthrow the Qing Dynasty and establish the Republic of China, making many admirable and moving heroic deeds. However, after the Xinhai Revolution, many people left the revolution. As a result, some people who were once reformers and revolutionaries were abandoned by history.

    Mr. Sun Yat-sen's greatness lies in his ability to "adapt to the world's trends and meet the needs of the people," always standing at the forefront of the times, tirelessly studying the domestic and international situation, summarizing past experiences and lessons, and guiding the masses forward step by step according to the characteristics of historical development. Mr. Sun Yat-sen's glorious and constantly progressing life is a model that every revolutionary should emulate.

    Mr. Sun Yat-sen lived in an era when the high tide of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom peasant revolution had just passed. At that time, the reactionary counter-current was growing, and foreign aggressive forces had penetrated into China's economic, political, military, and cultural fields. Advanced patriotic people worried and pondered, hoping to transform China, which was weak and humiliated, and its people poor, into a rich and strong China without overthrowing the Qing Dynasty regime. They launched a movement demanding political reform, which was called "Reform." The Reform Movement played a great role in exposing the darkness and corruption of the feudal system and spreading Western democratic ideas. Mr. Sun Yat-sen participated in this progressive movement in his early years.

    However, the Sino-Japanese War in 1894 immediately awakened this keenly observant young patriot. The defeat in the war further exposed the Qing Dynasty's dimwittedness, confusion, corruption, and incompetence. Under such a regime, any reform plan was a dream bubble. Mr. Sun Yat-sen was the first to realize this. He believed that the advancing wheels of history would ruthlessly crush the rule of the Qing Dynasty, so he abandoned the then-popular method of petitioning and actively launched an armed uprising in Guangzhou a few months after the Treaty of Shimonoseki was signed. Although the uprising failed, the development from general demands for reform to holding armed uprisings, daring to "rebel," was the first important step for Mr. Sun Yat-sen to adapt to historical development and constantly advance. Although Mr. Sun Yat-sen suffered persecution and curses from the ruling class after the failure of the Guangzhou Uprising, the course of history proved that Mr. Sun Yat-sen's path was correct. Without overthrowing the Qing Dynasty's rule, China's reform was hopeless. After the Reform Movement of 1898 and the Boxer Rebellion of 1900, the Qing Dynasty's stubborn attitude against any reform and its acts of ceding sovereignty and humiliating the country aroused great anger among the people. More and more people sympathized with Mr. Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary propositions.

    In 1898, the Filipino people revolted against the colonial rule of American imperialism. Because of the lack of military equipment, they sought help from Japanese patriots. Mr. Sun Yat-sen happened to be in Japan and strongly supported them. Although the Filipino people's revolution did not succeed, Mr. Sun Yat-sen's spirit of helping weak nations to seek liberation was demonstrated.

    The changes in the domestic situation at the beginning of the 20th century presented Mr. Sun Yat-sen with new tasks. The masses were widely revolutionized, but the organized revolutionary forces were still very weak and scattered. The constitutional monarchists still had a considerable influence among the masses, especially among intellectuals. To overthrow the rule of the Qing Dynasty, it was necessary to concentrate and organize these scattered forces and win over the masses under the influence of the constitutional monarchists. In 1905, Mr. Sun Yat-sen went to Tokyo, Japan, from Europe and timely solved this task. He formed the "Chinese Revolutionary Alliance" based on the Xingzhonghui, Huaxinghui, and Guangfuhui, incorporating groups and individuals with various anti-Qing ideas into this organization. The program of the Revolutionary Alliance was: "Expel the Tartars, restore China, establish a republic, and equalize land ownership." This program had a very important significance in Chinese history. Because opposing the rule of the Qing Dynasty was a demand that the Chinese people had not forgotten for more than two hundred years after the fall of the Ming Dynasty, but at that time, those who advocated overthrowing the rule of the Qing Dynasty did not and could not put forward the program of a democratic republic. The reformers of the late nineteenth century did not advocate overthrowing the rule of the Qing Dynasty. Mr. Sun Yat-sen used the program of a democratic republic to call for overthrowing the rule of the Qing Dynasty, which not only conformed to the requirements of the emerging national bourgeoisie but also conformed to the requirements of all people with anti-Qing traditions and other political dissatisfaction at that time. This program reflected the awakening of the Chinese nation and attracted a large number of people to the banner of revolution.

    It can be seen from Mr. Sun Yat-sen's program that he did not stop at opposing the Qing Dynasty and establishing a republic, because establishing a republic was an ideal in the East and had long been a fact in the West. The facts in the West show that the republic is not a perfect system. On the contrary, because world capitalism had entered the stage of imperialism, the deepening of internal contradictions and the rising tide of socialist revolution had put the Western republics in crisis. This trend of world historical development aroused Mr. Sun Yat-sen's vigilance. He realized that to save China, political revolution alone was not enough. Social revolution was also needed, so he proposed the slogan of "equalizing land ownership" to avoid inequality between the rich and the poor. Although "equalizing land ownership" alone cannot truly avoid inequality between the rich and the poor, on the contrary, this slogan is precisely "the purest, most thoroughly idealistic and perfect capitalism." Because the method of equalizing land ownership can only eliminate the feudal backward relations in agriculture and make capitalism develop more rapidly, this slogan did not exceed the scope of the bourgeois revolution. However, the proposal of this slogan showed that under the influence of the world historical trend, Mr. Sun Yat-sen subjectively expressed his dissatisfaction with capitalism and his sympathy for socialism. He often associated the Datong thought in "Li Yun" in the "Book of Rites" with socialism and communism as the basis of his Principle of People's Livelihood. The proposal of a clear bourgeois revolutionary program was the second important step for Mr. Sun Yat-sen to adapt to historical development and constantly advance. And his sympathy for socialism was an important ideological preparation that later prompted Sun Yat-sen to turn to socialist countries to seek support and cooperate with the Chinese Communist Party when he fell into difficulties.

    The Xinhai Revolution was a great victory with historical significance. In this revolution, what fell was the dynasty that the Chinese people had long failed to overthrow. With it, the Chinese autocratic monarchy also fell, replaced by the republican system, so people at that time felt particularly happy to be liberated. But it was precisely this victory that caused a sharp division in the Revolutionary Alliance that launched this revolution. Some people believed that the revolution had been completed, either studying abroad or returning to their studies; some were obsessed with parliamentary politics, thinking that as long as they controlled the parliament in the future, everything would be fine, and it did not matter if Yuan Shikai was the president; some were assimilated by the constitutional monarchists and simply acted as Yuan Shikai's lackeys. The revolutionary factions fell into a state of chaos in terms of organization and ideology. Only Mr. Sun Yat-sen stood firm in the reactionary counter-current, unwavering, and continued to fight against the evil forces. The Jiangning Campaign in 1913, the anti-Yuan war in 1916, and the Constitutional Protection Movement in 1917, Mr. Sun Yat-sen fought again and again, groping forward in the dark. However, although the people of the whole country continued to fight heroically, they did not find a bright way out. On the contrary, the Northern and Southern warlords fought each other, and the situation became more and more chaotic.

    In 1917, the great October Socialist Revolution took place in Russia, and Marxism-Leninism was introduced into China. Advanced Chinese intellectuals warmly welcomed this scientific socialism. In 1919, the "May Fourth" patriotic movement broke out, and the Chinese working class quickly stepped onto the political stage. In 1921, the great Chinese Communist Party was born, followed by a surging high tide of the workers' movement. This series of events marked the arrival of a new stage of revolution. In the face of these facts, all reactionary politicians hated, cursed, and trembled with fear. But the great Mr. Sun Yat-sen, based on the characteristics of the new era, re-examined the past of the revolution. In a semi-colonial and semi-feudal society like China, how could the victory of the revolution be achieved? This was the main question hidden in Mr. Sun Yat-sen's heart. The brilliant achievements of the October Socialist Revolution and the increasing development of the Chinese workers' and peasants' movement gave Mr. Sun Yat-sen important beliefs. He deeply realized from the experience of forty years of revolutionary failure the importance of the workers and peasants in the Chinese revolution, the vigorous revolutionary spirit of the Chinese Communist Party, and the sincere and selfless friendship of the Soviet Union to the Chinese people. He recognized these new social forces, welcomed the growth of these forces, determined the policies of alliance with Russia, alliance with the Communist Party, and assistance to peasants and workers, reorganized the Kuomintang, transformed the Kuomintang into a united front organization that could accommodate workers, peasants, communists, and the petty bourgeoisie, and gave new explanations to the Three People's Principles that were suitable for the requirements of the times. Nationalism focuses on opposing imperialism to seek equality with all countries and seeking equality among all nationalities at home; the Principle of Democracy focuses on establishing a democratic system shared by the general public rather than privately owned by a few; and the Principle of People's Livelihood focuses on the tiller owning his land and regulating capital. The basic principles explained by the New Three People's Principles are consistent with some basic principles of the political program of the Chinese Communist Party in the stage of democratic revolution, namely, the minimum program. This is the third important step for Mr. Sun Yat-sen to adapt to historical development and constantly advance. It is also one of the most important steps in Mr. Sun Yat-sen's life of continuous progress. This great progress promoted the revolutionary united front between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, enabling Mr. Sun Yat-sen to get rid of the difficult situation since the failure of the Xinhai Revolution and enabling the revolutionary movement to have the victorious development of 1924-27.

    These are several important steps in Mr. Sun Yat-sen's life of continuous progress. Unfortunately, he passed away in 1925 when the revolution reached its most important development. After Mr. Sun Yat-sen's death, the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, inherited and greatly developed Mr. Sun Yat-sen's ideals. Today, we have achieved a decisive victory in the socialist revolution.

    Perhaps some people will ask: Why was Mr. Sun Yat-sen always able to stand at the forefront of the times throughout his life? Why could his words and deeds always be consistent with the process of history? This can be explained from the class roots and the roots of personal understanding, that is, it can be explained from the characteristics of the Chinese national bourgeoisie represented by Mr. Sun Yat-sen, the position of this class, and Mr. Sun Yat-sen's personal efforts.

    On the one hand, the Chinese national bourgeoisie fears the masses because of its position as an exploiter and its weak economic power, and cannot carry the revolution through to the end, which is its backward side. On the other hand, it demands to get rid of the shackles of imperialism and feudalism for its own development, which is its progressive side. The anti-imperialist and anti-feudal progressiveness of the Chinese national bourgeoisie conforms to the requirements of history and the wishes of the broad masses of people. In this way, the progressive elements in the Chinese national bourgeoisie can and will cooperate with the workers and peasants under specific conditions, forming a historical friendship, accepting the leadership and assistance of the working class party in the actual struggle against imperialism and feudalism, and continuing to cooperate with the workers and peasants after the end of this struggle and embark on a new and bright road. This is different from the bourgeoisie of European and American countries. The bourgeoisie of European and American countries has achieved great development after the revolution, the country has become greatly rich and strong, and the society has become greatly prosperous. However, when capitalism developed to the era of imperialism, financial capital mixed and grown from banking monopolies and industrial monopolies controlled all economic lifelines. The laboring masses at home are being exploited by the monopoly capitalists, and abroad, they use force to oppress and enslave weak nations, turning them into their colonies and semi-colonies. At this time, the advanced capitalism in Europe and America has changed from the rising era to decadent, parasitic, and dying capitalism. The bourgeoisie of imperialist countries has not only completely lost its previous revolutionary and progressive nature, but has also become the most vicious counter-revolutionary force. But in China, one can still find "the bourgeoisie that represents true, fighting, and thorough democracy." Mr. Sun Yat-sen's lifelong adherence to the struggle against imperialism and feudalism reflects the bright and progressive side of the Chinese national bourgeoisie, so Lenin praised him as "full of the noble spirit and heroism inherent in such a class."

    The progressiveness of the Chinese national bourgeoisie can be concentratedly reflected in Mr. Sun Yat-sen, which is also inseparable from Mr. Sun Yat-sen's extensive knowledge, rich experience, and pragmatic spirit. Mr. Sun Yat-sen not only deeply investigated and studied Chinese history and the reality of Chinese life, but also understood foreign languages and traveled all over the world. He tirelessly studied various works of ancient and modern China and foreign countries, investigated the economic and political development of various countries, and absorbed reasonable ideological factors from them to form his theory of saving China - the Three People's Principles. And he used this theory to guide the revolutionary movement. After countless struggles and failures, Mr. Sun Yat-sen did not lose heart. He summed up experiences and lessons from failures, revised and supplemented his own theory from practice, and strived to make his subjective understanding closely follow the development of the objective situation. Finally, he formed the proposition of the New Three People's Principles. Mr. Sun Yat-sen's process of cognitive development is expressed very clearly in his will, that is, "After forty years of experience, I deeply know that to achieve this goal, we must awaken the masses and unite with the nations of the world that treat me equally to fight together." The New Three People's Principles - the highest crystallization of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's political thought - was born from forty years of revolutionary practice.

    This year is the ninetieth anniversary of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's birth. Reviewing Mr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings, inheriting and carrying forward Mr. Sun Yat-sen's constantly progressive revolutionary spirit, and always being as enthusiastic about the revolutionary cause as Mr. Sun Yat-sen, is the best way to commemorate this historical giant.

    孙中山先生伟大的革命精神
    吴玉章
    编者按　昨日上午，孙中山先生诞辰九十周年纪念筹备委员会和中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会学习委员会举行报告会，邀请社会主义学院院长吴玉章报告孙中山先生伟大的革命精神。出席报告会的有孙中山先生诞辰九十周年纪念筹备委员会委员，中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会副主席、常务委员和学习委员会委员，社会主义学院学员，各民主党派、各人民团体负责人等。在京的苏联专家四百多人也应邀出席了报告会。下面就是吴玉章报告的全文。
    中国有句老话：“识时务者为俊杰”。所谓“时务”，我们可以把它叫做历史的潮流，客观发展的趋势。作为一个革命者，应该而且也只能根据历史发展的客观规律，才能正确地领导群众，推动历史前进。因此洞察“时务”是一个革命家最重要的才能和最可贵的品质。孙中山先生就是善于洞察“时务”适应着历史发展而不断地进步的一个伟大的革命家。他经常说要以先知觉后知，以先觉觉后觉，这证明他是深深体会到这个道理的。因而他的言论和主张常常走在人民的前面。
    近代中国的历史发展是十分急剧的，多少人因为不能正确地认识客观形势而栽了跟头。1898年戊戌变法以前，许多爱国的维新志士希望学习俄国彼得大帝的改革和日本明治天皇的维新，要求自上而下的实行变法，这在当时是一种进步的思潮，维新派曾经在当时的进步青年中起过很大的启蒙作用，而被统治阶级看做洪水猛兽。维新派也曾有些人作过英勇的斗争，如谭嗣同等杀身成仁、舍生取义的气概，尤其使人崇敬。但是戊戌变法失败以后，许多维新派起来反对革命，变成了不识时务的人。在1900年到1911年辛亥革命期间，许多热心的革命派，在推翻清朝和建立民国的号召下，英勇地投入了战斗，作出了许多可歌可泣的英雄事迹。但是辛亥革命以后，不少人离开了革命。结果是某些曾经是维新的、革命的人被历史遗弃了。
    孙中山先生的所以伟大，就在于他能够“适乎世界之潮流，合乎人群之需要”，永远站在时代的最前列，不倦地研究国内外情况，总结过去的经验教训，根据历史的发展的特点而一步一步引导群众前进。孙中山先生光辉的不断前进的一生是每个革命家应当效法的榜样。
    孙中山先生在太平天国农民革命高潮刚刚过去的时代。当时，反动逆流在增长，外国侵略势力深入到中国的经济、政治、军事、文化各个领域。先进的爱国志士们忧虑着、思索着，他们希望在不推翻清朝政权的条件下把积弱受侮、民穷财困的中国改造为富强的中国。他们发起一个要求政治改革的运动，这个运动叫做“维新”。维新运动在揭露封建制度的黑暗腐败和传布西方民主主义思想方面起了很大的作用。孙中山先生早年曾经参加过这个进步的运动。
    但是1894年的中日战争立即惊醒了这个目光敏锐的青年志士，战争的失败更加暴露了清朝的昏瞶胡涂、腐朽无能。在这样的政权下，任何改革计划都是梦幻泡影，孙中山先生是最早认识到这一点的。他相信：前进着的历史巨轮一定会无情地辗碎清朝统治，于是他抛弃了当时流行的请愿上书的方式，在中日马关条约订立的几个月后，便在广州积极发动武装起义。起义虽然失败，但是从一般的要求改革发展到举行武装起义，敢于“造反”，这是孙中山先生适应历史发展而不断前进的第一步重要阶梯。虽然在广州起义失败以后，孙中山先生受尽了统治阶级的迫害和咒骂，但是历史进程证明：孙中山先生的道路是正确的，如果不推翻清朝统治，中国的改革是无望的。经过1898年的戊戌变法和1900年的义和团运动，清朝的反对任何改革的顽固态度和丧权辱国，激起了人民的极大愤怒。同情孙中山先生的革命主张的人越来越多了。
    1898年，菲律宾人民起义反对美帝国主义的殖民统治。因军械缺乏而求助于日本志士，中山先生适在日本也大力给以支持。虽然菲律宾人民革命没有成功，而中山先生帮助弱小民族求得解放的精神由此得到表现。
    二十世纪初国内形势的变化给孙中山先生提出了新的课题。群众广泛地革命化了，但是有组织的革命力量还很弱小、还很分散，君主立宪派在群众中，特别是在知识分子中，仍旧有相当大的影响。为要推翻清朝统治就必须把这些分散的力量集中起来、组织起来，必须把立宪派影响下的群众争取过来。1905年孙中山先生从欧洲到了日本东京，及时地解决了这个任务，他以兴中会、华兴会、光复会作为基础，组成了“中国同盟会”，把具备各种反清思想的团体和个人容纳在这个组织里。同盟会的纲领是：“驱除鞑虏，恢复中华，建立民国，平均地权”，这个纲领在中国历史上具有非常重要的意义。因为反对清朝统治是中国人民在明朝灭亡以后二百多年没有忘记过的要求，但是那时主张推翻清朝统治的人都没有也不可能提出民主共和国的纲领，十九世纪末的维新运动者又不主张推翻清朝统治。中山先生用民主共和国的纲领来号召推翻清朝统治，不但符合于新兴民族资产阶级的要求，而且符合一切有反清传统和当时其他对政治不满的人们的要求。这个纲领反映了中国民族的觉醒，并把人民群众大量地吸引到革命的旗帜下来。
    从孙中山先生的纲领中可以看到：他并没有停留在反清和建立共和国上，因为建立共和国，在东方是理想，在西方早已是事实。西方的事实表明共和国并不是一个完善无缺的制度，相反，由于当时世界资本主义已经进入帝国主义阶段，内部矛盾的深刻化，社会主义革命潮流的高涨，已使西方的共和国面临着危机，世界历史发展的这个趋势引起了孙中山先生的警惕。他认识到：要挽救中国，仅仅政治革命是不够的，还需要社会革命，所以提出要避免贫富不均的“平均地权”口号。虽然只有“平均地权”并不能真正避免贫富不均，恰恰相反，这个口号正是“最纯粹的，高度彻底的理想上完满的资本主义”。因为平均地权的办法只能是铲除农业中的封建落后关系而使资本主义更加迅速地发展起来，这个口号并没有超过资产阶级革命的范围。可是，这个口号的提出，表明了在世界历史潮流的影响下，孙中山先生主观上对资本主义的不满和对社会主义的同情。他常常把“礼记”里面“礼运篇”的大同思想和社会主义、共产主义联系起来，作为他的民生主义的根据。明确的资产阶级革命纲领的提出，这是孙中山先生适应历史发展而不断前进的第二步重要阶梯。而他对于社会主义的同情是后来孙中山陷入困难的时候，推动他转向社会主义国家去寻找支援力量，并和中国共产党合作的一个重要的思想准备。
    辛亥革命是一个伟大的有历史意义的胜利。在这次革命中倒下去的，是中国人民长期没有能够把它推倒的王朝，随着他倒下去的还有中国的君主专制制度，而代替它的是共和制度，所以当时人们特别感到解放的欢欣。但是也正是这个胜利，使发动这个革命的同盟会发生了剧烈的分化。有的人认为革命已经大功告成，或出国留学，或回到书斋里去了；有的人醉心于议会政治，以为今后只要控制住议会，就万事大吉，总统给袁世凯做也无关重要；有的人被君主立宪派同化，干脆充当袁世凯的走狗去了。革命派在组织上和思想上陷入一片混乱。只有孙中山先生屹立在反动的逆流中，坚定不移，继续和恶势力战斗。1913年的赣宁之役，1916年的倒袁战争，1917年的护法战争，孙中山先生一次又一次的奋斗着，在黑暗中摸索前进。但是全国人民虽然不断地英勇奋斗，并没有找到光明的出路，恰恰相反，南北军阀互相混战，时局日甚一日的更加混乱了。
    1917年俄国发生了伟大的十月社会主义革命，马克思列宁主义传入中国，中国先进的知识分子热诚地欢迎这个科学的社会主义。1919年爆发了“五四”爱国运动，中国工人阶级迅速地登上政治舞台。1921年伟大的中国共产党诞生了，随之而掀起了汹涌澎湃的工人运动的高潮。这一连串事件，标志着革命新阶段的到来。在这些事实面前，一切反动政客憎恶着、诅咒着，害怕得发抖。但是伟大的孙中山先生根据新时期历史的特点，重新审查了革命的过去，在中国这样一个半殖民地半封建的社会里，怎样才能取得革命的胜利？这是蕴藏在孙中山先生心里最主要的问题。十月社会主义革命的辉煌成就，中国工农运动的日益发展，给予孙中山先生以重要的信念。他从四十年的革命失败经验中深深体会到：工农群众在中国革命中的重要性，中国共产党生气勃勃的革命精神，苏联对中国人民真诚无私的友谊。他认识了这些新的社会力量，欢迎这些力量的成长，确定了联俄、联共、扶助农工的政策，重新改组了国民党，把国民党改造成为一个能够包容工农群众、共产党员和资产阶级小资产阶级的统一战线组织，并且把三民主义作了适合时势要求的新解释，民族主义对外以反对帝国主义求得与各国平等和对内以求得各民族平等为中心；民权主义以建立为一般平民所共有非少数人所得而私的民主制度为中心；民生主义以耕者有其田和节制资本为中心。新三民主义所解释的基本原则和中国共产党在民主革命阶段的政治纲领即最低纲领的若干基本原则，是互相一致的。这是孙中山先生适应历史发展而不断前进的第三步重要阶梯。也是孙中山先生一生不断前进的一个最重要的阶梯。这个伟大的进步，促成了国民党和共产党的革命统一战线，使孙中山先生摆脱了自辛亥革命失败以来的困难境地，使革命运动有了1924年——27年的胜利发展。
    这就是孙中山先生一生不断地进步的几个重要阶梯。可惜他在1925年革命达到一个最重要的发展的时候就与世长辞了。在孙中山先生逝世之后，中国人民在中国共产党领导下继承并大大发展了孙中山先生的理想。到今天，我们已经取得了社会主义革命的决定性的胜利。
    也许有人会问：为什么孙中山先生一生始终能够站在时代的最前列？为什么他的言行始终能和历史的进程保持一致？这可以从阶级的根源上和个人认识的根源上找到解释，也就是说，可以从孙中山先生所代表的中国民族资产阶级的特性这个阶级所处的地位以及孙中山先生个人的努力上来找到解释。
    中国民族资产阶级一方面由于所处的剥削者的地位和经济力量的薄弱而害怕群众，不能把革命坚持到底，这是它的落后的一面，另一方面它为了本身的发展而要求摆脱帝国主义、封建主义的束缚，这是它的进步的一面。中国民族资产阶级反帝反封建这一方面的进步性符合于历史的要求，符合于广大人民的意愿。既然这样，那么中国民族资产阶级中的进步分子在特定条件下就可以而且也必然会跟工农群众携手合作，形成一种历史的友谊，在反帝反封建的实际斗争中接受工人阶级政党的领导和帮助，在这个斗争结束以后，继续和工农群众合作下去而走上一条新的光明道路。这是和欧美国家的资产阶级不同的，欧美国家的资产阶级在革命后得到了很大的发展，国家大大富强起来，社会大大繁荣起来，但是当资本主义发展到帝国主义时代，由银行垄断和工业垄断混合生长起来的财政资本控制了一切经济命脉，国内的劳动群众受着垄断资本家们敲骨榨髓的剥削，国外则以武力压迫和奴役弱小民族，把他们变成为自己的殖民地和半殖民地。这时候的欧美先进资本主义已经由上升的时代而变成腐朽的、寄生的、垂死的资本主义。帝国主义国家的资产阶级不仅完全丧失了以前的革命性、进步性，而且成为最凶恶的反革命力量了。可是在中国却还能找到“代表真实的、战斗的、彻底的民主主义的资产阶级”。孙中山先生一生坚持反帝反封建的斗争正是反映着中国民族资产阶级光明的进步的一面，所以列宁称赞他“是充满着这样一个阶级所固有的高尚精神与英雄气概”。
    中国民族资产阶级的进步性所以能够集中地表现在孙中山先生身上，又是和中山先生个人广博的学识、丰富的经验以及实事求是的精神分不开的。孙中山先生不仅深入地调查研究中国的历史和中国的现实生活，而且还通晓外国的语言文字，遍游过世界各国。他孜孜不倦地研究古今中外的各种著作，调查各国经济、政治的发展状况，从其中吸取合理的思想因素，构成一个他的救中国的理论——三民主义。并把这个理论去指导革命运动，经过无数次的斗争和失败，孙中山先生毫不灰心地从失败中总结经验教训，从实践中修改和补充自己的理论，努力使自己的主观认识紧紧跟上客观形势的发展，最后终于形成了新三民主义的主张。孙中山先生的认识发展过程在他临终的遗嘱中表述得很清楚，就是：“积四十年之经验，深知欲达到此目的，必须唤起民众，及联合世界上以平等待我之民族，共同奋斗”。新三民主义——孙中山先生政治思想的这个最高结晶品正是从四十年革命实践中产生的。
    今年是孙中山先生诞生的九十周年，重温中山先生的遗教，继承和发扬中山先生不断进步的革命精神，永远像中山先生那样始终不懈的热心干革命事业，这是纪念这位历史巨人的最好的办法。
