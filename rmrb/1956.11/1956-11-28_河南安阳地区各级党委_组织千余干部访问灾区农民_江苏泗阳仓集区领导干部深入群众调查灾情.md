    Henan Anyang Region Party Committees at All Levels
    Organize Over a Thousand Cadres to Visit Farmers in Disaster Areas
    Leading Cadres in Cangji District, Siyang, Jiangsu, Conduct In-Depth Investigations into Disaster Conditions Among the Masses
    (Our newspaper's report) According to Henan Daily: In Anyang Region, Henan Province, many county and district leading cadres are personally leading cadres to conduct general surveys in disaster areas. According to statistics from Neihuang, Junxian, and six other counties alone (lacking Anyang and Changyuan), over 1,300 county and district cadres were organized to mobilize and lead cadres from the entire disaster area's townships, cooperatives, and teams to visit disaster-stricken households. Through inspections, the eight counties discovered that over 8,700 disaster victims lacked over 10,000 pieces of winter clothing, over 500 quilts, and 106 households were living in mat sheds. There were also instances of livestock being left in the open and disaster victims lacking rations. They immediately resolved these problems. For disaster-stricken households living in mat sheds, temporary housing was arranged on the one hand, and disaster victims were helped to repair their houses on the other. After discovering that six members of the fifth team of the Shunhe Cooperative in Junxian were living in mat sheds, the cooperative branch secretary personally stayed with the team to help them arrange and repair houses. At the same time, livestock sheds were also inspected, and attention was paid to keeping them warm. The Jianhua Fourth Cooperative in Nanle discovered that a livestock shed had no walls and blocked it with sorghum stalks that night and plastered it the next day. The problems of some disaster victims lacking rations and food stamps have also been resolved. After the winter difficulties of these disaster victims were resolved, the disaster victims were very grateful.
    (Our newspaper's report) Responsible cadres in Cangji District, Siyang County, Jiangsu Province, conducted in-depth investigations into disaster conditions, correcting the ideological bias of relying solely on government relief in production and disaster relief work, saving the state 200,000 yuan in disaster relief expenditures.
    Cangji District, Siyang County, experienced reduced wheat yields and lost late autumn harvests this year. Among the district's more than 100 agricultural cooperatives, according to reports from each cooperative, there were six particularly severely affected cooperatives, 39 severely affected cooperatives, 53 lightly affected cooperatives, 19 cooperatives with reduced production, and three non-disaster cooperatives. It was reported that 700,000 yuan in relief funds would be needed this winter and spring.
    In order to ascertain the true extent of the disaster, some responsible comrades of the district party committee went to various agricultural cooperatives to conduct investigations. The investigation results revealed that some cooperatives were exaggerating the disaster situation. For example, the Heping Cooperative in Yaowei Township originally reported that it was a particularly severely affected cooperative, but this year the cooperative distributed an average of 120 jin of miscellaneous grains per person, and they also failed to report 30,000 jin of rice. If these are added, an average of 202 jin of grain can be distributed per person. The Hexi Agricultural Cooperative in Tuyuan Township, originally reported as a "severely affected cooperative," still had 24,000 jin of grain in storage after clearing the warehouse that had not been distributed. The Dawang and Wangzhuang agricultural cooperatives have been requesting relief since the wheat harvest, and these relief funds have not been used to this day.
    The occurrence of these exaggerated reports in the Cangji District's production and disaster relief was mainly due to the "more money, the better" mentality of grassroots cadres. They did not conduct in-depth investigations and research on the disaster situation, but only listened to the masses crying out about the disaster, which fostered the masses' thinking of simply relying on relief.
    After conducting in-depth investigations, the district party committee held two cadre meetings, educating the cadres and explaining that exaggerating the disaster situation not only wastes state wealth but also creates a simple reliance on relief among the masses, hindering the smooth progress of production and disaster relief work. At the same time, each cooperative was required to comprehensively clear grain warehouses, cash, and work point accounts to calculate the actual amount of relief funds needed.
    During this inspection, it was verified that the Xuwei Cooperative, originally reported as a "particularly severely affected cooperative," is now changed to a medium cooperative; Zhangqiao, a "severely affected cooperative," has become a lightly affected cooperative. Two agricultural cooperatives that were originally reported as "particularly severely affected" have been changed to severely affected cooperatives, four "severely affected cooperatives" have been changed to lightly affected cooperatives, and nine "lightly affected cooperatives" have been changed to cooperatives with slightly reduced production. The entire district cleared more than one million jin of grain from the warehouses alone.
    After the phenomenon of exaggerating the disaster situation was corrected, the district's original estimate of 700,000 yuan in relief funds needed for this winter and spring was reduced by 200,000 yuan. At the same time, it also increased the cadres' confidence in leading the masses in production and disaster relief. After being educated, the masses also reversed their thinking of relying on relief and actively engaged in production for self-salvation. In the past, 96% of the members of the Hexi Cooperative were clamoring for relief and refused to engage in production. Now, sideline production such as turning out vermicelli and weaving mats have also been launched. The scope of relief has been reduced to 40%.

    河南安阳地区各级党委
    组织千余干部访问灾区农民
    江苏泗阳仓集区领导干部深入群众调查灾情
    本报讯　据河南日报报道：河南省安阳地区很多县、区领导干部都亲自带领干部深入灾区进行普查。仅据内黄、浚县等八个县的统计（缺安阳、长垣），就组织了一千三百多名县区干部发动和带领整个灾区乡、社和队的干部深入灾户访问。通过检查八个县共发现八千七百多个灾民缺寒衣一万多件，棉被五百多条，住席棚的一百零六户。还有一部分牲畜露宿和灾民缺乏口粮的现象。他们对这些问题都立即进行了解决。对于住席棚的灾户一方面临时给调剂房子住，另一方面帮助灾民进行房屋修建。浚县顺河社发现第五队有六户社员住席棚后，社支书便亲自住队帮助他们调剂和修建房屋。同时对牲口房也进行了检查，注意了保温。南乐建华四社发现一所牲口房没围墙，当晚用秫秸堵上，次日就泥好了。一些灾民缺乏口粮和粮票的问题，也都得到解决。这些灾民的过冬困难得到解决之后，灾民都非常感激。
    本报讯　江苏省泗阳县仓集区负责干部深入调查灾情，纠正了生产救灾工作中单纯依靠政府救济的思想偏向。为国家节省救灾支出二十万元。
    泗阳县仓集区今年麦季减产，晚秋失收。全区一百多个农业社当中，据各社自报，有特重灾社六个、重灾社三十九个、轻灾社五十三个、减产社十九个、非灾社三个。据报今冬明春需要救济款七十万元。
    为了确察灾情，该区区委的一些负责同志，分别深入各农业社进行了调查。调查结果，发现有些社虚报灾情。如姚圩乡和平社，原报是特重灾社，而该社今年杂粮平均每人分配一百二十斤，他们还漏报了三万斤稻子。如果加上这些平均每人可分配二百零二斤粮食。土元乡河西农业社，原报为“重灾社”，经过清仓，还存有二万四千斤粮食没有分配。大王、王庄两农业社，从麦收后就要求救济，直到现在这些救济款还没有动用。
    仓集区生产救灾中，这些虚报现象的发生，主要是由于基层干部有“钱多好办事”的思想，对灾情不深入调查研究，只听群众喊灾叫灾，助长了群众单纯依赖救济的思想。
    深入调查后，区委先后召开了两次干部会议，对干部进行了教育，说明虚报灾情不仅浪费国家财富，也会造成群众的单纯依赖思想，阻碍生产救灾工作的顺利进行。同时要求各社全面清理粮仓、现款、工分账，计算出实际需要的救济款数。
    在这次检查中核实，徐圩社原报为“特重灾社”，现在改为中等社；张桥“重灾社”变成了轻灾社。两个原报“特重灾”的农业社改为重灾社，四个“重灾社”改为轻灾社，有九个“轻灾社”改为稍有减产社。全区光是清仓粮食就有一百多万斤。
    虚报灾情的现象纠正以后，全区原估计今冬明春所需要的七十万元救济款，削减了二十万元。同时也提高了干部对领导群众生产救灾的信心。群众经过教育，也扭转了依赖救济的思想，积极生产自救。河西社原来有96％的社员闹救济不肯生产，现在拐粉、织席等副业生产也都开展起来了。救济面缩小到40％。
