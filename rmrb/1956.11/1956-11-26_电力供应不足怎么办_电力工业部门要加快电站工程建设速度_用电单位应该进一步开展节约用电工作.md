Xinhua News Agency, November 25th: Xinhua News Agency reporter Wang Liang reports: Currently, twenty-three regions across the country are experiencing varying degrees of insufficient power supply. These regions mainly include: Beijing, Tianjin, Tangshan, Jinan, Xi'an, Zhengzhou, Chengdu, Chongqing, and Guangzhou. The reason for the insufficient power supply is mainly that the growth of generating plant equipment capacity cannot keep up with the needs of national economic development.

	The development of the electricity industry has been quite rapid in recent years, with many new and expanded thermal and hydro power stations; in 1955, the country's electricity equipment capacity increased by 51.6% compared to 1952. So far this year, the nation has put into operation over 450,000 kilowatts of new power generating equipment. However, all sectors of the national economy are generally booming this year. The production of major electricity-consuming enterprises such as steel and cotton yarn will exceed the planned levels for 1957 in 1956. The development speed of coastal industries has also accelerated compared to the original plan. As a result, the demand for electricity has outstripped supply.

	According to the reporter's information from the Ministry of Electric Power Industry, in order to solve the problem of insufficient power supply, the Ministry of Electric Power Industry is working hard in many ways to accelerate the speed of power station construction projects while ensuring the quality of the projects, so that some newly built and expanded power stations can be put into operation ahead of schedule. It is expected that by the end of this year, the country's state-owned electric power industry will have more than 130,000 kilowatts of generating equipment put into production. Next year, a number of new and expanded power stations will also be built according to the needs of national construction. However, due to the limitations of national investment and material supply, the scale and speed of electric power industry construction cannot fully meet the requirements of the accelerated development of the national economy. It is estimated that in the future, the problem of insufficient power supply will continue to exist for a certain period of time; the situation will become even more serious in some areas. Therefore, further developing regular, rational, and economical electricity use throughout the country is of urgent and significant importance at present and in the future.

	In the past few years, many industrial and mining enterprises across the country have done a lot of work in developing rational and economical electricity use and have saved a lot of electricity. In 1955 alone, the electricity saved nationwide was equivalent to the annual power generation of 74,000 kilowatts of generating equipment. However, the phenomenon of electricity waste in industrial and mining enterprises is still very serious. The unit power consumption of the same product still varies greatly among enterprises of the same type. If electricity is further saved, the potential that can be tapped is still very large. According to estimates by the Ministry of Electric Power Industry, if national industrial electricity consumption can be saved by 5% to 10% in 1957, 600 million to 1.2 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity can be saved. If this electricity is used in the coal industry, it can increase coal production by 30 million to 60 million tons.

	The main way to save electricity is to combine it with the technical transformation of equipment and the improvement of production processes to reduce the electricity consumption per unit of product. The new technologies of rapid steelmaking, formulating power characteristic curve steelmaking, and the currently adopted oxygen steelmaking method, which have been promoted in China's steel industry in recent years, have greatly increased steel production and reduced the electricity consumed per ton of steel.

	The work of saving electricity for lighting should not be ignored; this work is particularly important for some cities where lighting electricity accounts for a large proportion. At present, the waste of electricity in lighting in some cities' government agencies and organizations is serious. In some office buildings of Beijing's agencies, although there are not many office workers after work in the evening, the lights are still brightly lit. Saving electricity for lighting should start from opposing waste and achieve rational use under the conditions of not hindering work, study, and health.

	Adjusting the electricity load has a great effect on easing the tension of electricity supply. The Northeast, Shanghai, and Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan power grids have saved more than 200,000 kilowatts of generating equipment by adjusting the load. However, adjusting the load inevitably brings more or less impact and inconvenience to the production of factories and the lives of workers. When adjusting the load, all localities must conduct in-depth investigations and research, take appropriate measures based on the degree of tension of the power supply in the region and the production characteristics and electricity consumption ratio of each enterprise, and take care of the lives of workers as much as possible within the possible range.

    电力供应不足怎么办
    电力工业部门要加快电站工程建设速度
    用电单位应该进一步开展节约用电工作
    新华社25日讯　新华社记者王良报道：目前全国有二十三个地区存在着程度不同的电力供应不足的现象。这些地区主要有：（北）京（天）津唐（山）、济南、西安、郑州、成都、重庆和广州。电力供应不足的原因，主要是发电厂设备能力的增长赶不上国民经济发展的需要。
    电力工业这几年来的发展是相当快的，新建和扩建了许多火力和水力电站；1955年全国电力的设备容量比1952年增加了51.6％。今年到目前为止，全国新投入生产的发电设备就有四十五万瓩以上。但是，今年国民经济的各个部门都普遍高涨。钢铁和棉纱等主要用电企业的生产，都将在1956年超过1957年计划水平。沿海工业的发展速度也比原来加快了。这样，电力就发生了供不应求。
    据记者从电力工业部获悉，为了解决电力供应不足的问题，电力工业部正在从多方面努力，争取在保证工程质量的前提下加快电站建设工程的速度，使某些新建和扩建的电站提前投入生产。预计在今年年底，全国国营电力工业将有十三万多瓩的发电设备投入生产。明年根据国家建设的需要，还要新建和扩建一批电站。但是，由于国家投资和器材供应的限制，电力工业建设的规模和发展的速度还不可能完全满足国民经济加速发展的要求。估计，今后在一定时期内，电力供应不足的问题将继续存在；在某些地区情况还将更加严重。因此，在全国进一步开展经常性的合理和节约用电的工作，在目前和今后都有迫切的重大的意义。
    在过去几年中，全国许多工矿企业在开展合理与节约用电方面曾作了不少工作，节约了不少电力。仅1955年全国节约的电能就相当于七万四千瓩发电设备的全年发电量。但是，工矿企业用电的浪费现象目前也还是很严重的。同一类型的企业中，同一产品的单位耗电量还相差很大。如果进一步节约用电，可能发挥的潜力还是很大的。据电力工业部估计，1957年全国工业用电如果能节约5％到10％，就可以节省电六亿到十二亿度。这些电能如果用于煤炭工业，能多采煤三千到六千万吨。
    节约用电的主要途径，必须结合设备的技术改造和生产工艺过程的改进，去降低单位产品的耗电量。我国钢铁工业几年来推广的快速炼钢，制定电力特性曲线炼钢和正在采用的吹氧炼钢法的新技术，都大大地提高了钢的产量，并且降低了每吨钢所消耗的电力。
    节约照明用电的工作也不容忽视；特别是对一些照明用电比重占得较大的城市，这一工作尤其重要。目前不少城市中的机关、团体在照明方面浪费电力的情况是严重的。北京市有些机关办公大楼在晚上下班以后，虽然办公人员不多，但是灯光仍然一片辉煌。节约照明用电，应该从反对浪费出发，在不妨碍工作、学习、健康的条件下做到合理使用。
    调整电力负荷对于缓和电力供应的紧张局面，有很大的作用。东北、上海和京津唐电力网，由于进行调整负荷工作，等于节省二十余万瓩的发电设备。但是调整负荷也不可避免地给工厂的生产和职工的生活带来或多或少的影响和不便。各地在调整负荷的时候，必须深入调查研究，根据本地区电源的紧张程度和各个企业生产的特点、用电的比重等情况，采取恰当的措施，在可能范围内尽量照顾到职工的生活。
