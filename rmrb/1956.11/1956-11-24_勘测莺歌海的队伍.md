    The Team Surveying Yingge Sea
    Lin Jianzheng
    To the Frontier

    Yingge Sea, what a beautiful name! It is a large, barren area lying on Hainan Island, at the eighteenth degree north latitude line, protruding into the South China Sea. Because the towering Jianfengling Mountains, rising 1,400 meters above sea level, block the invading rain clouds from three sides, the annual rainfall is more than two-thirds less than in other parts of the island, with three consecutive dry seasons each year. Here, one sees a vast expanse of blue sky, occasionally dotted with cumulus clouds, like a few small cotton bolls on a huge piece of blue satin, appearing deep and clear. Eagles spread their straight wings and circle low. These phenomena are only seen in the dry winter in southern mainland China. Therefore, here, as long as seawater is introduced, the natural energy of the tropical dry zone can be used to establish a modern salt field, producing 500,000 tons of crude salt and 150,000 tons of chemical raw materials annually.

    650,000 tons, enough to fill tens of thousands of train cars!

    As early as 1942, when the Japanese invaders occupied Hainan Island, they spent three years surveying it for wartime needs. When they surrendered, they burned the maps and documents for three days and three nights, leaving no data behind. The Kuomintang government, hearing of the potential profits, loudly proclaimed that it would conduct surveys, but the officials, after circling the site in an airplane, were intimidated by the vastness of the Yingge Sea. In their investigation report, they wrote: "The local area is still in the primitive era... a barbaric region," and added, "Frontier development is extremely difficult and dangerous; without rewards, no one will be willing to go." After that, nothing more was heard.

    In our era, frightening words can no longer intimidate anyone. From May of last year to the present, two to three hundred male and female surveyors of various ages and accents have come to this land of over ten thousand hectares to begin surveying work in meteorology, hydrology, geology, surveying, drilling, harbor observation, and soil science. Dai Shenwei, a seventeen-year-old female team member, had never left the big city with her eight siblings. When she heard the news of frontier development, despite hearing many legends about snakes and mosquitoes on Hainan Island, she resolutely joined. Liu Kai, the deputy chief engineer of the Yingge Sea Salt Field Preparatory Office, came from Beijing. He had just taken off his leather coat in the north, and when he arrived here, he saw that the rice was already ripe. His clothes were soaked with sweat again and again. He could only use a little of the hard-to-get water to wipe himself off each day. His skin peeled from the sun, and blisters formed on his feet, but he still insisted on field reconnaissance from morning till night, sometimes even having to sleep on an oxcart overnight. The consultant engineer from the Guangdong Provincial Design Institute, over sixty years old, was already white-haired. When walking, he always refused to sit on the oxcart prepared for him and always walked ahead of others. He said, "I have traveled to many countries, but I have never seen such an ideal place!"

          On the Site

    The Yingge Sea grassland, like velvet, has an inland lake of over a thousand hectares at the other end. Looking from here, the entire scene stretching to the horizon is a brownish-yellow expanse, as if nothing existed in the world but grass. But looking from the other side, the entire scene stretching to the horizon is a shimmering expanse of lake water, with no trace of the grassland to be found. Besides, there are thousands of hectares of desert and thorny jungles. Many small ditches flow quietly, dividing the grassland into many wet marshes. The survey team's tents and thatched sheds are set up in these places.

    The vast grassland looks so beautiful, but it also brings difficulties to the survey team. During the day, the temperature inside the tents sometimes rises to 115 degrees Fahrenheit. Due to the strong evaporation, the outdoor air becomes like shaking smoke, and the ground a kilometer away cannot be seen clearly. It is difficult for surveyors to find the flag markers within a few hundred meters. White flags are planted at the outdoor soil test points, and the observer walks toward the flag he has spotted. As he gets closer, the white flag suddenly flies away with a "嘎" sound, revealing itself to be a wild crane. At night, everything is pitch black, and those who return late will get lost here. One survey team group got lost from sunset until late at night and could not find their way. One night, hydrological observer Chen Qiuzhen left the station to look at the water gauge by the lake. When she returned, she could not tell the direction and walked into the increasingly deep water plants, unable to find her way out. As a result, she had to wait for dawn, soaking in waist-deep water for ten hours. The Dan Village Port sea measuring station, built 25 li deep into the desert, takes an hour to carry fresh water. The team members not only struggle with the scorching sun, water shortages, and getting lost, but also with poisonous snakes and centipedes that unceremoniously crawl into their tents. Sun Hong, the drilling team leader, once killed three poisonous snakes in one day. Qiu Guang, a survey team member, killed a snake two and a half meters long. However, the survey team members are not very afraid of snakes; what they fear most are leeches.

    At midnight on July 8, a tropical typhoon struck the Yingge Sea. The wind whipped across the pitch-black grassland, blowing the loose soil into trenches. On the shore, giant waves like mountains surged from the sea, flattening the steep beach in an instant. The water gauge of a harbor observation station group on the southern coast had its steel cable broken, followed by the water gauge itself. The people in the station risked their lives to rescue it in the waves, but they could not install it. It seemed that valuable hydrological data would be lost. At this time, engineer Wu Luzhong and the comrades under his leadership came to help. On this day, he had just fallen off his bicycle and injured his leg, but now he came limping along. Ignoring his comrades' advice, he stubbornly worked with the young people in the pitch-black night, chest-deep in water, driving piles, and finally retrieving the valuable hydrological data. He said modestly: This is to strive for accurate design data, and it is also everyone's responsibility to the country. What he is doing now is testing the seawater concentration rate and soil permeability rate. Although his seven children in Guangzhou often write to him asking him to come home, he says: "The survey work is more important than anything else!"

      Teaching and Learning

    "The survey team grows from small to large. The country has many resources to develop. We can't give them to many technical cadres. We are building our team by teaching apprentices and learning from teachers." A spirited, thin man spoke humorously about the team. He said, "We have become a rather large school. Well, I, this student, am still not learning well enough!" He is Sun Huigong, the deputy director of the Yingge Sea Salt Field Preparatory Office, and now the person in charge of the survey team. Before coming here, he was the deputy director of the Hainan Nationalities Affairs Commission, and his hometown is also near here. Ten years ago, he led a guerrilla team back here to attack the Japanese invaders' survey team, breaking through the enemy's heavy defenses and burning down the enemy's barracks in one fell swoop. In the early days of liberation, when he returned to the neighboring county as the county magistrate, he stopped by to see his children and saw the changes in the lives of the people in his hometown, but he did not expect that this remote land would also undergo tremendous changes.

    He said that when the first batch of teams arrived here, there were few technicians. Apart from some transferred administrative cadres, most were newly employed students and local youths who had been transferred. They had little experience and little knowledge, and it was worrying whether they could keep up with the needs at the time. However, "Unexpectedly, there has been a great change!"

    When the first team arrived here, there was a young man from Sichuan named Sang Zhencai, who spoke with a heavy local accent and steadily took down a leather case-like aneroid barometer he was carrying. He was transferred from the provincial meteorological bureau to establish a meteorological station here. He saw a barren land and began to lose confidence. He thought of the beauty of his hometown: the jade-like Minjiang River, bamboo houses, and the unique "Qingcheng" tea. But here, it was all yellow grass, no houses, and even getting water was a problem. What's more, he had no assistants! He asked to go back several times. Director Sun told him: Wouldn't it be better to build this place more beautiful than your hometown? Can't assistants be trained? So the leaders assigned him three local youths, none of whom had any meteorological knowledge. The first problem was not understanding the language, but a contract for guaranteed teaching and learning was finally signed. Unexpectedly, the students' desire to learn was so strong. At first, Lao Sang was so busy that he couldn't even eat. Originally, meteorological observation required at least one year of professional study to be able to do. Now, in less than half a year, the new observers can accurately complete more than 160 items of observation within the prescribed half-hour shift!

    Lao Sang, no longer talks about the Minjiang River. He has planted oleanders, silver acacia, and other seedlings around the newly built meteorological station and is wholeheartedly watering them.

    We also talked about the five women in the marine observation team, four of whom were junior high school graduates. Only the one called "Big Sister" Xiao Gao graduated from South China Institute of Technology. Their ages were seventeen to twenty-two, and it was their first time coming to the island. I remembered meeting Xiao Gao on the ship a year ago. She held a bag of apples her mother had bought her and said naively to the new companions: "I'll eat this big one, and you can have the rest!" At that time, I knew that she had never left her mother's side. Her mother was fond of quiet and played the piano well. She mentioned her mother in almost every sentence, how good her mother was! I didn't expect her to leave her mother and jump to the remote island. When they reached the strait, the wind and waves gradually increased, and the ship started to rock. They vomited and some cried in fear.

    Now, walking on the beach, you can see five white dots from afar, moving nimbly. That's them moving the theodolite, signaling with flags, drawing and drawing on the map. The sun-tanned Xiao Gao is in command. They are proficient in various instruments, accurately conducting observations of waves, currents, flow velocity, beach movement, and many other items. They have learned to swim and no longer vomit when rowing in the waves. I praised the four little sisters:

    "You are learning really well!"

    "Yes, Xiao Gao is very patient in teaching." They answered seriously, then laughed again. Yes, Xiao Gao not only teaches technology, but she is also a very good math teacher in the team.

    This year, many professional groups have emerged in the team, and more than one hundred young people have made plans to advance towards science according to their professions. The hydrological and geological group alone has compiled nearly 100,000 words of lectures. Most of the sixty or so young members of the Youth League who had proposed to become familiar with the business within a year have fulfilled their guarantees. I asked the seventeen-year-old Xiao Dai if she missed home? She said, "There's no time to miss it, the salt field will start design next year!" She added quietly, "I'm determined to become a technician!"

      Happy Masters

    As the sunset dyes the sky red, the melodious accordion plays on the vast grassland. I hear the "Yingge Sea Song" created by the survey team members themselves:

    On the blood-stained wilderness, tents are now erected, the candlelight sways in the blue night, Yingge Sea sings for tomorrow.

    Speaking of the blood-stained wilderness, the residents here talk about the bitter past. When the Japanese imperialists surveyed here, they often murdered the people near the grassland, dismantled the bricks of the houses to pave roads, and forced men, women, and children to do hard labor. Countless people died of starvation, beatings, burns, and being crushed by vehicles. Just one epidemic caused by keeping the laborers together killed four hundred people. The enemy even burned the patients who were not dead alive in the fire. At that time, the residents hid when they heard the Japanese voices, and even the children dared not cry.

    The children of the past have grown up. They recall their terrible childhood and enviously talk about the children who cling to the survey team's motorcycles and refuse to get off, and the children who hold onto the survey team's bicycles and refuse to let them leave. A dark and thin young man whom people call "Iron Nail" Chen Yunbiao told me that when the Japanese surveyed here, his entire family was forced to do hard labor. His seventy-year-old grandfather was brutally tortured by the enemy. At that time, the family relied on eating cactus stems to fill their stomachs. His mother went to the fields before dawn and returned after dark to find some food. He spent his childhood in hunger and fear.

    He frowned and continued: After the Japanese left, life was still not good. He became a fisherman at the age of twelve, going out to sea to fish. When he was exhausted, he was still beaten and scolded by the boat owner! His face suddenly brightened:

    "But after liberation, the People's Government sent me to school. Because I had studied for a few years in elementary school, this time I graduated from junior high school, and then I was sent to my own survey team. I was really overjoyed!" Now he is the map administrator of the survey team. He quickly became familiar with and managed hundreds of maps that filled several large safes. The day he came to the survey team, his old grandfather, who had been tortured by the Japanese in the past and is now eighty years old, was so happy that he could not speak.

    Isn't it? His grandson has joined his own team for the construction of his motherland. Like this young man, dozens of elders have sent their children to the team.

    Not long ago, Chen Yunbiao also learned map drawing. He said proudly: "We, the people of the Hainan Li and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, who are located in the remote frontier, are not only the masters of construction now, but also the masters of science!" Yes, recently, local youths like him have been sent by the survey team to Tianjin to study chemistry.

    The sound of the accordion stopped, and the sound of the generator sounded on the grassland. The electric lights on the trestles came on, and the loudspeaker broadcast beautiful music. It turned out that today is Sunday, and the people from nearby villages have flocked to the survey team's station. The survey team members' bicycles also brought back the children of the people. Tonight, a movie will be shown!

    On a row of benches, I saw some different guests. There were fishermen who had dived into the sea for the survey team to find obstacles, there were girls who often brought tea and water to the survey team, and there were old people who had been cured of their eye diseases by the survey team's clinic and regained their sight. (The team's clinic has gratuitously cured more than sixty people suffering from eye diseases caused by local sandstorms.) These people, tonight, are talking about surveying and construction like masters, making me feel as if every resident here has become a survey team member.

    At night, the dark blue sky covers the quiet grassland. Only the beautiful music from the projector gently echoes on the land that was once called "primitive" and "barbaric," full of hope. People who are guests and hosts to each other are immersed in this peaceful joy.

    勘测莺歌海的队伍
    林建征
    到边疆
    莺歌海，多美丽的名字啊！它是躺在海南岛上北纬线十八度突出南海边的一块大荒地。由于尖峰岭等拔海一千四百公尺的大山横断在它后方，挡住了三面入侵的雨云，所以，年雨量比全岛各地少三分之二以上，一年有三个连续干季。在这里，举头看见的是一片蓝湛湛的天空，偶尔出现一些积云，就像巨幅的青缎上放着几朵小棉桃，显得深远，明净。老鹰伸开笔直的翅膀低低的盘旋。这些现象，在南方大陆，只有干燥的冬天才能见到。因此，在这里，只要把海水引进来，利用热带干区的自然能来建立现代化的盐场，每年就可生产五十万吨的原盐和十五万吨的化学原料。
    六十五万吨，要载满好几万个火车皮呢！
    远在1942年，日本侵略者占领海南岛的时候，为了战争的需要，曾经用了三年时间勘测它。到投降的时候，焚烧了三天三夜的图籍，一点资料都没留下。国民党政府听说有利可图，曾大吹大擂要勘测，谁知官儿们坐着飞机到现场转了一个圈子，就被浩阔的莺歌海吓怕了。他们在考察报告中写道：“当地尚在原始时代……为蛮荒之区”，接着又说：“边疆开发，极备艰苦，且冒危险，若不奖励，无人愿往”。以后就无声无息了。
    我们的时代，可怕的字眼再也吓不倒人，从去年5月到现在，各种年纪、口音的二、三百男女勘测人员，来到了这块上万公顷的土地上，开始了气象、水文、地质、测量、钻探、海港观测、土壤等专业的勘测工作。十七岁的女队员戴深维八兄妹都没有离开过大城市，当她知道开发边疆的消息时，尽管听到许多关于海南岛多蛇多蚊的传说，也坚决参加了。莺歌海盐场筹建处副总工程师刘凯是从北京来的。他在北方刚脱下皮衣，到这里一看水稻已经熟了。汗水一遍遍湿透衣裳，他每天只能用一点点不易得来的水擦擦身，皮肤被阳光晒脱了，脚上起了泡，他仍坚持由早到晚的野外踏勘，有时竟要睡在牛车上过夜。六十多岁的广东省设计院顾问工程师已白发苍苍了，走路时总不肯坐到为他准备的牛车上，而且老是走在别人的前头。他说：“我走遍了许多国家，还没有见过这么理想的地方呢！”
          场地上
    像天鹅绒一样的莺歌海草地，另一端是一个上千公顷的内湖。从这里看过去，连着天边尽是褐黄的一片，好像这个世界除了草什么都没有了。但从那边看过来，连着天边的却是一片闪闪的湖水，再也找不出草地的影子。除此之外，周围还有宽达几千公顷的沙漠地和多藤多刺的丛林。许多细小的沟坑悄悄地流着，把草地又分割成许多湿沼。勘测队的帐篷和茅棚，就在这些地方架设起来。
    辽阔的草地看去多美丽啊，但它又为勘测队带来困难。白天，帐篷里的气温有时升至华氏一百一十五度，野外由于蒸发力强而造成像抖动着烟雾般的气流，有时一里路远的地面就看不清了，测量员在几百公尺内找标旗就很困难。如野外土壤试验点都插了白旗，观测员朝着看准了的白旗走去，近了，白旗竟嘎的一声飞走了，原来是一只野鹤。晚上，四面茫茫一片，晚归的人就会迷失在这里。测量队有一个组，从日落时迷失到深夜还找不到路。有一晚，水文观测员陈求珍离开驻地到湖边看水尺，回来时看不出方向，走在越来越深的水草里找不到出路，结果只好等待天亮，被齐腰的水泡了十个钟头。建立在深入沙地二十五华里的丹村港测海站，挑一次淡水要一个钟头。队员不但经常同烈日、缺水、迷路作斗争，还要和不客气地爬到帐篷里的毒蛇、蜈蚣斗争。钻探队长孙宏曾一天打死三条毒蛇。测量队员丘光就打死过一条两公尺半长的大蛇。但是，勘测队员不很怕蛇，最怕的还是蚂蝗。
    7月8日的半夜，热带台风袭击了莺歌海，狂风鞭打着漆黑的草原，将疏松的泥土吹成一道道坑。在岸边，像一座座山的巨浪从海里涌上来，把陡立的沙滩一下子荡平了。靠南边海岸的海港观测站的一组水尺，钢线被压断了，接着水尺也压断了。站里的人冒险在海浪下抢救，但总是安装不上，眼看宝贵的水文资料就会丧失。这时，伍履中工程师和他领导下的同志赶来支援了。这一天，他刚巧骑自行车摔伤了腿，现在一拐一拐地来到了。他不听同志们的劝告，倔强地和青年一道在漆黑的夜里、齐胸的水里打桩，终于把宝贵的水文资料夺了回来。他谦逊地说：这是为了争取精确的设计数据，也是每个人对国家应负的责任。他现在所做的是海水浓缩率和土壤渗透率的试验。虽然他在广州的七个孩子经常写信叫他回家一趟。但他说：“勘测工作比什么都重要！”
      教的和学的
    “勘测队是由小到大的。国家有许多富源要开发，不能给许多技术干部，我们是教徒弟、拜老师兴家的。”一个炯炯有神的瘦个子有风趣地讲着这个队。他说：“我们变成一座相当大的学校了。唔，我这个学员学习得还差哩！”他就是莺歌海盐场筹建处的副处长孙惠公，现在是勘测队的负责人。他来这里以前，是海南民族事务委员会的副主任，他的家乡也就在这附近。十年前，他带领过游击队回到这里袭击过日本侵略者的勘测队，突破敌人的重重防御，一把火把敌人的营房烧光了。解放初期，当他回到邻县当县长时，曾顺路回家看孩子，他看到家乡群众生活的变化，但没有想到，这块偏僻的土地也将要发生巨大的变化。
    他讲到勘探队伍初来时，技术人员少，除去一些调来的行政干部外，都是一些新参加工作的学生和当地调来的青年。他们经验少、知识少，是否赶得上需要当时是令人耽心的。然而，“想不到也发生了极大的变化！”
    当第一批队伍到达这里，有一个来自四川叫桑振材的青年，操着很重的家乡口音，稳重地解下背在身上的一支皮匣式的气压计。他是省气象局调来这里建立气象站的。他看到一片荒地就信心不足起来，他想起家乡的美丽：碧玉一样的岷江，竹子做的房子，别有风味的“青城”茶。而这里，一片黄草，没有房子，吃水也成问题。何况没有助手啊！他几次提出要回去。孙处长告诉他：把这里建设得比家乡更美丽不好么，助手不是也可以培养么？于是领导上配给他三个地方青年，都是没有气象知识的。第一个问题是不懂话，但包教包学的合同终算订下来了。出人意料之外，学生的求知欲是这样强，初时，忙得老桑连饭也吃不上，本来气象观测起码要一年以上的专业学习才能作，现在不到半年时间，新的观测员在规定的半小时值班内，已经能够准确地完成一百六十多个项次的观测了！
    老桑，再也不谈岷江了，他已在新建的气象站周围，栽上了夹竹桃、银合欢等树苗，一心地把它浇灌大。
    我们又讲起海洋观测组的五个女同志，其中四个是初中毕业生，只有称为大姐的小高是华南工学院毕业的。他们的年龄是十七到二十二岁，都是第一次到海岛来。我记起一年前在船上碰到小高，她捧着妈妈买给她的一包苹果，天真地对新来的伙伴说：“这个大的我吃，别的请你们吃！”那时我知道她从来没有离开过妈妈身边，妈妈是爱静的，弹得一手好钢琴。她差不多每句话都提起妈妈，妈妈多好啊！我想不到她能离开妈妈蹦到遥远的海岛来。到海峡了，风浪逐渐增大，船身随着颠簸起来，她们哇哇地吐了，有人吓得哭起来。
    现在，走在海滩上，远远可看到五个小白点，灵快地活动着，这就是她们在移动经纬仪，打旗号，在图上划着、划着。晒得黑黑的小高，在指挥着。她们熟练地掌握着各种仪器，准确地进行着波浪、流向、流速、沙滩移动等许多项目的观测。她们学会了游泳，在波浪里划船再不吐了。我对这四个小妹妹称赞说：
    “你们学习得真好啊！
    “好，小高教人真耐心哪。她们正经地回答，说完又笑起来了。是的，小高不但教技术，她还是队里的一个很好的数学教师。
    今年，队里出现了许多专业组，一百多个青年按业务订下了向科学进军的规划。光是一个水文地质组就编写了近十万字的讲义。以前提出要一年内熟悉业务的六十多个青年团员，绝大部分都实现了自己的保证。我问十七岁的小戴想家不？她说：“哪有时间想，盐场明年就要开始设计了！”她接着悄悄地说：“我下定决心当技术员哩！”
      欢乐的主人
    当霞光染红天际的傍晚，悠扬的手风琴在辽阔的草地上奏响了，我听到了勘测队员自己创作的“莺歌海之歌”：
    血染过的原野上，如今架起了篷帐，蓝色的夜里烛光摇荡，莺歌海为明天歌唱。
    提起血染过的原野，这里的居民谈起苦难的过去。当日本帝国主义者在这里勘测时，经常杀害草原附近的群众，把房子的砖头尽拆去铺路，不论男女老幼都被强迫做苦工。饿死、打死、烧死、车辆辗死的不计其数。光是把苦工关在一起而引起的一次瘟疫，就死去四百人。敌人还要把未死的病人活活抛在火里烧死。那时，居民听到日本人的声音就躲起来，甚至连小孩子也不敢哭了。
    过去的小孩子都长大了，他们回忆起可怖的童年，羡慕地讲着扒在勘测队的摩托车上不肯下来的小孩、扳着勘测队员的自行车不让走的小孩。一个黑黑瘦瘦的人们叫他做“铁钉”的青年陈运标告诉我，日本人勘测这里时，他全家都被迫作苦工，七十多岁的祖父还被敌人残暴地拷打过。那时候，一家人就靠吃仙人掌茎块充饥，母亲为了找点粮食，鸡叫就上地，天黑后才回家。他是在饥饿恐惧中渡过童年的。
    他锁着眉头又讲下去：日本人走了后，生活依然不好，他十二岁就充当渔工出海打鱼，筋疲力尽的时候，还挨渔主的打骂！他的脸色突然开朗起来了：
    “可是，解放后人民政府送我入学校，由于小时读过几年小学，这回算在初中毕业了，跟着又被派到自己的勘测队来，可真乐坏了！”现在，他是勘测队的图籍管理员，他很快地熟悉并管好了载满几个大保险柜的上百种图籍。他到勘测队那一天，他那过去被日本人拷打过，现在已是八十岁高龄的老祖父竟高兴得说不出话来。
    可不是吗，他的孙子进到自己的队伍了，是为了自己祖国的建设事业。像这个青年人一样，几十个长辈都把自己的子弟送到队里来。
    不久前，陈运标又学会了描图的工作，他骄傲地说：“我们这处在遥远边疆的海南黎族苗族自治州的群众，现在不仅是当了建设的主人，同时还要当科学的主人呢！”是的，最近就有和他一样的当地青年，被勘测队送到天津学化验去了。
    手风琴的声音停止了，草原上响起了哒哒的发电机声，架在槎?上的电灯亮起来，扩音器也播出美妙的音乐。原来，今天是星期日，附近村落的群众，都涌到勘测队的驻地来，勘测队员的自行车也带着群众的小孩回来了，今晚要放映电影啊！
    在一排凳子上，我见到一些不同的来宾。有曾经为勘测队潜入海里探明障碍的渔民，有经常给勘测队送茶送水的姑娘，还有被勘测队的医疗所治好了眼疾而重见光明的老人。（这个队的医疗所曾无偿地治好了六十多个为地方风砂造成眼病的人）。这些人，今晚都像主人一样地谈着勘测、谈着建设，使我感到好像这里每个居民都成为勘测队员了。
    入夜，暗蓝色的天空复盖着静静的草原，只有从电影机发出的幽美的音乐，悠扬地荡漾在曾经被称为“原始”和“蛮荒”的大地上，这上面充满希望。互为宾主的人们，都浸沉在这和平的欢乐中。
