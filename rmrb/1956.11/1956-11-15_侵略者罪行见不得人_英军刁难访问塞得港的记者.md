　　British Army Harasses Journalists Visiting Port Said
　　Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, November 14th: TASS Cairo, November 13th dispatch: A group of foreign newspaper journalists, including correspondents from Soviet, Italian, Yugoslavian, German, and Japanese newspapers stationed in Cairo, intended to visit Port Said, occupied by the British and French invading forces, on November 12th. They were forcibly prevented by the British army and taken to an isolated house for imprisonment.
　　A representative of the British command threatened to send everyone to Cyprus. Only after the journalists protested and firmly demanded that they be allowed to return to Cairo immediately did the British military authorities have to release them in the evening and no longer obstruct their return to Lake Manzala, where representatives of the Egyptian Information Department were waiting for them.

    英军刁难访问塞得港的记者
    据新华社14日讯　塔斯社开罗13日消息：一批外国报纸的记者，其中包括苏联、意大利、南斯拉夫、德国和日本报纸驻开罗的记者，11月12日打算访问被英国和法国侵略军所占领的塞得港，结果被英国军队用武力阻止，并且被带到一所隔离的房屋中监禁。
    英国司令部代表扬言要把所有人送往塞浦路斯，只有在记者提出抗议和坚决要求让他们能够立刻回返开罗以后，英国军事当局才不得不在晚间释放他们，并且不再阻挠他们回孟扎拉湖，那里有埃及情报司的代表在等候着他们。
