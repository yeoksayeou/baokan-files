    Ahead of 1957 Level
    Shanghai Cotton Textile Industry
    5.4 Million Bales of Yarn and 3.1 Billion Meters of Cloth Produced in Three Years and Ten Months
    Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Shanghai's cotton textile industry, which accounts for about one-third of the country's current spindle equipment, had already reached the planned levels for 1957 in terms of output value and production by the end of October, one year and two months ahead of schedule.
    From 1953 to the end of October this year, Shanghai produced nearly 5.4 million bales of cotton yarn and more than 3.1 billion meters of cotton cloth. This amount of cotton cloth is enough to make a new outfit for everyone in the country. Calculated by the unit output of each spindle and each loom, the output of state-owned textile factories this year increased by 74% - 80% compared to the early days of liberation in 1950. In the first three quarters of this year, state-owned textile factories produced 234 new varieties of yarn and cloth.
    In recent years, the labor productivity of textile workers has also increased rapidly. This year, the labor productivity of workers in state-owned textile factories (the last two months are estimated figures, the same below) increased by more than 15% compared to 1953, and due to the rapid growth in production after joint state-private management, the labor productivity of joint state-private factories increased by 33% compared to 1953. The wages of these textile factory workers have also increased this year, with the average wage of workers in state-owned factories increasing by 15.88% compared to 1953, and adjustments are currently underway in joint state-private factories.
    Shanghai's cotton textile industry, which is still the largest and most concentrated in China, has accumulated a lot of construction funds for the country in recent years. From 1953 to the present, the profits turned over to the state by more than 20 state-owned textile factories alone are enough to build a Changchun No. 1 Automobile Factory.
    From 1953 to the present, Shanghai textile factories have also systematically transferred more than 3,400 textile technicians and managers, as well as more than 1,100 senior technicians, to newly built textile factories in the interior. The main technical and administrative management personnel of the 13 cotton textile factories newly built and under construction in Beijing, Zhengzhou, Shijiazhuang, and Xi'an are all from Shanghai.

    提前达到1957年水平
    上海棉纺织工业
    三年十个月生产五百四十万件纱，三十一亿公尺布
    新华社讯　占到全国目前纱锭设备约三分之一的上海棉纺织工业，到10月底为止，产值和产量都已经提前一年零两个月达到了1957年的计划水平。
    从1953年到今年10月底为止，上海共生产了近五百四十万件棉纱，三十一亿多公尺棉布。这些棉布，足可以供全国每人做一套新衣服。如果以每枚纱锭和每台布机的单位产量计算，国营纺织厂今年的产量比解放初期1950年增长了74％——80％。今年前三个季度，国营纺织厂生产的纱和布的新品种有二百三十四种。
    这几年来，纺织工人们的劳动生产率提高得也很快。今年，国营纺织厂工人的劳动生产率（最后两个月是预计数，下同）比1953年提高15％以上，公私合营厂由于企业合营以后生产迅速增长，今年劳动生产率比1953年提高33％。这些纺织厂工人的工资今年也有新的增长，其中国营厂工人工资平均比1953年增长15.88％，公私合营厂目前正在进行调整。
    目前仍然是我国最大最集中的上海棉纺织工业，几年来为国家积累了很多的建设资金。从1953年到现在，单是二十多个国营纺织厂上缴给国家的利润，就可以兴建一个长春第一汽车厂。
    从1953年开始到现在，上海纺织厂还有计划地向内地新建纺织厂输送了三千四百多名纺织技术人员和管理人员以及一千一百多名高级技工。北京、郑州、石家庄和西安等地新建的和正在建设中的十三个棉纺织厂的主要技术人员和行政管理人员，都是从上海去的。
