Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu: Part of the members of the Second Sub-delegation of the Central Delegation, led by Deputy Head Liu Zhongwu, arrived in Ebian County, Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture, Sichuan, on the banks of the Dadu River on the afternoon of the 18th.

Over 4,000 Yi and Han people greeted the delegation in the suburbs of Ebian City. Deputy Head Liu Zhongwu and others accepted flowers from Yi and Han women.

As the members of the delegation passed through the welcoming line, the masses cheered, "Liweiji Jia (Welcome relatives)!" The sound of firecrackers and applause was deafening. Some Yi welcomers even brought ancestral ear pearls and special products from Liangshan, ready to give to the delegation and ask the delegation to take them to Chairman Mao.

That evening, people of all ethnic groups held an Yi dance party for the delegation.
