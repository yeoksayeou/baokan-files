Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 18th: Agricultural cooperatives in Sichuan Province are massively increasing the planting of green manure crops. Agricultural cooperatives in Suining, Leshan, Fuling and other regions have utilized field ridges and ridge walls to plant 140,000 mu of broad beans and peas.

According to the experience of some agricultural cooperatives, harvesting the broad beans planted on two to four mu of field ridges at the flowering stage is enough to fertilize one mu of paddy fields as base fertilizer. Every 2,000 jin of *ma sang* (a type of shrub) is equivalent to the fertilizer effect of twelve to fifteen *dan* of human and animal manure. Another method adopted by agricultural cooperatives in various places to increase the planting of green manure crops is to plant broad beans, *vetch* and other green manure crops in between rapeseed and wheat fields. Rapeseed and wheat grow relatively slowly in winter. When their growth accelerates in spring, the interplanted broad beans, *vetch*, etc., are harvested for use as green manure. The roots of crops such as broad beans and *vetch* that remain in the soil and decompose can also supply the rapeseed and wheat crops with the fertilizer they need in the later stages of growth. The province plans to interplant broad beans, *vetch* etc. on more than 5.5 million mu this year, and most agricultural cooperatives have already planted them.

### 四川大量增种绿肥作物

    四川大量增种绿肥作物
    据新华社成都18日电　四川省各地农业社大量增种绿肥作物。遂宁、乐山、涪陵等专区的农业社利用田埂和田埂壁，种植了蚕豆、豌豆十四万亩。
    根据一些农业社的经验，每两亩到四亩的田埂蚕豆在开花时收割下来，可以够一亩水稻作底肥；每两千斤马桑相当于十二担到十五担人畜粪的肥效。各地农业社增种绿肥作物的另一个办法，是在油菜、小麦田中间种上蚕豆、苕子等绿肥作物。油菜、小麦冬季生长较慢，等到春季生长转快的时候，便把间种的蚕豆、苕子等收割起来作绿肥使用。而蚕豆、苕子等作物的根部留在土中腐烂，还可以供给油菜、小麦等生长后期对于肥料的需要。全省今年计划这样间种蚕豆、苕子等五百五十多万亩，现在大部农业社已经种上了。
