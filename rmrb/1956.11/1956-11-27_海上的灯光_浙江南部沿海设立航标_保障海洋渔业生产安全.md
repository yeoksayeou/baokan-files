    Lights on the Sea
    Navigation Marks Established Along the Southern Zhejiang Coast to Safeguard Marine Fisheries Production Safety
    (Our report) The Wenzhou Prefectural Aquatic Products Bureau of Zhejiang Province recently completed the first batch of thirteen fishery navigation marks in important waterways and fishing grounds along the southern Zhejiang coast. The cost of establishing these navigation marks was entirely funded by the government.
    Now, the bright lights on the navigation marks shine brightly through the long nights, giving fishermen direction for navigating their boats in the dark. During the day, they can also see clear signs, preventing ships from sailing into dangerous sea areas. Speaking of the Baimutian Reef, south of Aojiangkou in Pingyang County, fishermen are terrified. The vicinity of the reef is an important fishing route with rapid currents. When the tide rises, the reef is submerged, making it difficult for ships to find their bearings. Vessels often run aground on this reef, capsizing and causing deaths. Since ancient times, countless tragic accidents have occurred at Baimutian Reef. Before liberation, who would have cared about these things!
    Now, a tall, giant-like beacon stands on Baimutian Reef, radiating light at night. Fishermen always gaze at it with immense gratitude as they sail near the reef.
    The Wenzhou Prefecture plans to continue establishing twenty-five fishery navigation marks next year to further ensure the safety of marine mass fisheries production. (Hong Shaobing)

    海上的灯光
    浙江南部沿海设立航标  保障海洋渔业生产安全
    本报讯　浙江温州专署水产局最近在浙江南部沿海重要航道和渔场建成了第一批渔业航标十三处。这批航标建立的费用，全部由政府拨款。
    现在航标上的灯光明亮地长夜放射，渔民们在黑夜中航船有了方向，白天里也可以看到明显的标志，防止船只驶进危险的海区。平阳县敖江口偏南的百亩田礁，说到它，渔民们谁都要心惊胆颤。礁的附近是渔业重要航道，水流湍急，遇涨潮岩礁没入水面，航船就找不到目标，往往触上这块海礁，翻了船，死了人。自古以来，在百亩田礁不知发生过多少使人悲痛的事故。在解放以前，谁会管这些事情呢！
    百亩田礁上，现在竖立着高高的巨人一样的标架，晚上灯光四射。渔民们驶船经过礁的附近，总怀着无限感激的心情，凝视着它。
    温州专区计划明年继续建立二十五处渔业航标，进一步保障海洋群众渔业生产的安全。（洪绍炳）
