    New Ore Body Discovered in Xiangshan Pyrite Mine Area
    (Our newspaper dispatch) After more than two years of prospecting work by geological personnel, a large amount of mineral deposits has been found in Xiangshan Pyrite Mine in Anhui Province, one of the main pyrite mines in China.
    Anhui Xiangshan Pyrite Mine is close to the Yangtze River, about thirty miles away from Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Plant. This mine was mined as early as 1940. After liberation, according to the geological data left behind, it was calculated that this iron mine could only be maintained until 1955. Therefore, it was considered a mine that "lacked resources, maintained production, and was prepared to collapse."
    In order to tap the production potential of the mine and extend its life, the old workers of Xiangshan Pyrite Mine suggested re-mining the areas that had been mined by the Japanese. After this suggestion was adopted, from 1952 to 1955, ore equivalent to twice this year's planned output was recovered from the mined-out areas. The old workers also suggested conducting underground drilling exploration around the old ore body. From last year to now, 1,754,000 tons of mineral deposits have been explored.
    Since 1954, the state has also sent geological exploration teams to conduct prospecting work in the mountains of this mining area. At present, the third new ore body around the old mine has been discovered. According to current statistics, the proven reserves of pyrite in the new ore body and the old ore body are more than 10 million tons. If it is produced into commercial ore, calculated based on this year's output of Xiangshan Mine, it can be mined for forty years. In addition, a larger amount of low-grade ore has been found buried around the existing ore body.
    The construction of this iron mine will begin by the end of next year, and it will be put into production in 1959. At that time, the production volume will be three to five times the current output of Xiangshan Mine. In order to determine the reserves of pyrite in Xiangshan, the geological exploration force of Xiangshan Pyrite Mine next year will be more than doubled compared to this year.

    向山硫化铁矿地区发现新矿体
    本报讯　在我国开采硫化铁矿的主要矿山之一——安徽向山硫化铁矿，经过地质人员二年多的找矿工作，又寻找到了大量矿藏。
    安徽向山硫化铁矿靠近长江，距离马鞍山铁厂约三十里。这个矿从1940年就进行开采，解放后，据留下的地质资料计算，这个铁矿只能维持到1955年。因此，被认为是一个“缺少资源、维持生产，准备垮台”的矿井。
    为了发掘矿井生产潜力，延长矿井寿命，向山硫化铁矿的老工人建议在被日本人开采过的地方，再次开采，结果采纳了这一建议后，从1952年到1955年在采空区就找回了相当今年计划产量二倍的矿石。老工人又建议在老矿体周围进行井下打峒探矿，从去年到现在，已探到一百七十五万四千吨矿藏。
    从1954年起，国家又派出了地质勘探队在这个矿区的群山中进行找矿工作。到目前，老矿周围的第三新矿体已被发现。据现在的统计，探清的新矿体与老矿体的硫化铁矿的储量有一千多万吨，如生产成商品矿石，以今年向山矿产量计算，即可供开采四十年。另外，还发现有更大量的品位较低的矿石埋藏在现有矿体周围。
    这个铁矿明年底将动工建设，1959年投入生产。那时，生产量将相当于今年向山矿产量的三倍到五倍。为了在向山探清硫化铁矿的储量，明年向山硫化铁矿的地质勘探力量还将比今年扩大一倍以上。
