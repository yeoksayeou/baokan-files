Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, November 20th: Premier Zhou Enlai, accompanied by Tran Duy Hung, Chairman of the Hanoi Municipal Administrative Committee, and Hoang Van Hoan, Vietnamese Ambassador to China, visited Hanoi University, the Children's Palace, the scenic Hoan Kiem Lake in the city center, and the Hai Ba Trung Temple in the suburbs today.

During the visit to the Vietnam General University and the Medical University, which share the same campus, Zhou Enlai was warmly welcomed by Nguyen Van Huyen, Minister of Education of Vietnam, Nguyen Khanh Toan, Deputy Minister, and more than two thousand principals, teachers, and students from various universities.

Zhou Enlai addressed the students from various universities in Hanoi who gathered in the square in front of the school building. He said, "We are very happy to have the opportunity to visit your university and learn something from you." He said, "Every nation and every country has its strengths and things worth learning. If we cannot learn a lot today due to time constraints, we will send students and experts to continue learning from you in the future."

Zhou Enlai said, "I envy the university students in Hanoi for being able to study and conduct academic research in a free environment. When I was young, I received a bourgeois education. That kind of education restricted people's individuality and was not free, so we must oppose it."

Zhou Enlai said, "The bourgeoisie only gives freedom to a small group of people, allowing them to freely exploit and oppress the people. They educate a minority of people to act as their tools to help them freely oppress the people. The Chinese people and Chinese university students do not want this kind of freedom. What they want is the freedom of the vast majority of people, the freedom of thought and academic freedom of the vast majority of people. Only socialism liberates individuality and gives everyone freedom of thought and academic freedom." He said that he believed that the Vietnamese people and Vietnamese students, like the Chinese people and Chinese students, want the freedom of the vast majority of people, and absolutely do not want the former colonialists to re-oppress the Vietnamese people's freedom.

Zhou Enlai's speech constantly aroused warm cheers and applause from the teachers and students present.

The Hai Ba Trung Temple is a temple commemorating two Vietnamese national heroines, Trung Trac and Trung Nhi. These two queens, who once unified Vietnam, resisted the invading army led by Ma Yuan of the Chinese Han Dynasty more than 1,900 years ago, and finally died heroically. Premier Zhou Enlai laid flowers in front of the statues of Trung Trac and Trung Nhi.

At the Hanoi Children's Palace near Hoan Kiem Lake, Zhou Enlai and others were welcomed by more than 1,500 Vietnamese and overseas Chinese children. The children rushed to put red scarves on Zhou Enlai and other guests and invited the guests to visit their recreational facilities. Vietnamese and Chinese children's choirs sang "Ode to Ho Chi Minh," "The East is Red," and "Song of the Chinese Young Pioneers" for the guests. The wonderful performance of a children's orchestra composed of about fifty children received unanimous praise from the guests.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, November 20th: Premier Zhou Enlai, accompanied by Vice Premier He Long and others, visited the Thong Nhat Match Factory and the Gia Lam Railway Repair Factory in the suburbs of Hanoi this afternoon, accompanied by Tran Duy Hung, Chairman of the Hanoi Municipal Administrative Committee, and Le Thanh Nghi, Minister of Industry of Vietnam.

The Gia Lam Railway Repair Factory is a famous factory in Vietnam, and its workers were a strong vanguard in the Vietnamese independence struggle. The Thong Nhat Match Factory is a new factory established in Hanoi after its re-liberation with Chinese assistance. It is the only mechanized match factory in Vietnam, and the matches it produces can not only supply the entire Vietnam but also have some exports. There are currently some Chinese technical experts and technicians working in both factories to assist.

The workers of both factories held grand gatherings to welcome Zhou Enlai. When the heads of the two factories delivered welcoming speeches, they expressed their gratitude to the Chinese comrades for their help.

In his speech, Zhou Enlai specifically pointed out that it is right for China to support Vietnam's construction. The prosperity and strength of Vietnam are beneficial to both the Chinese and Vietnamese people. Chinese experts should constantly check their shortcomings in their work, improve their work, serve the Vietnamese people better, and learn the various advantages of the Vietnamese people in order to achieve common improvement. Finally, he congratulated the growing consolidation and closeness of the unity and friendship between the working classes and the peoples of China and Vietnam.

The workers cheered Zhou Enlai's speech with great enthusiasm, and finally sang "Unity is Strength" and bid farewell to Zhou Enlai as he left the factory.

    周总理向河内大学生讲话
    参观工厂受到热烈欢迎
    新华社河内20日电　周恩来总理今天上午在河内市行政委员会主席陈维兴和越南驻中国大使黄文欢等陪同下，参观了河内的大学、少年儿童俱乐部、市中心的还剑湖的名胜和市郊的二征王庙。
    在参观校址在一起的越南综合大学和医科大学的时候，周恩来受到越南教育部部长阮文煊、副部长阮庆全、各大学的校长、教师和学生二千多人的热烈欢迎。
    周恩来向聚集在学校大楼前面广场上的河内各大学的学生讲了话。他说，我们很高兴能有机会来参观你们的大学，向你们学习一些东西。他说，每一个民族、每一个国家都有它的长处，都有它值得学习的地方。如果我们今天由于时间关系不能学到很多的东西，我们今后要派学生、派专家继续向你们学习。
    周恩来说，我很羡慕河内的大学生能在自由的环境里进行学习和学术研究。我自己在年轻的时候受的是资产阶级的教育。那种教育是束缚人的个性的，是不自由的，因此我们要反对它。
    周恩来说，资产阶级只给一小撮人以自由，让他们自由地去剥削和压迫人民。他们教育了少数人来充当他们的工具，来帮助他们去自由压迫人民。中国人民、中国的大学生不要这种自由，他们要的是绝大多数人的自由，是绝大多数人的思想自由和学术自由。只有社会主义才解放了个性，才给了每一个人以思想和学术的自由。他说，他相信越南人民、越南学生也和中国人民、中国学生一样是要绝大多数人的自由，而绝对不要过去的殖民者重新压迫越南人民的自由。
    周恩来的讲话不断引起在场的教师和学生热烈的欢呼和鼓掌。
    二征王庙是纪念越南两位民族女英雄征侧和征贰的庙。这两位曾经统一过越南的女王在一千九百多年以前抗击过中国汉朝马援率领的侵略军，最后壮烈殉国。周恩来总理在征侧、征贰的像前献了花。
    在还剑湖附近的河内少年儿童俱乐部，周恩来等受到一千五百多名越南和华侨少年儿童的欢迎。儿童们抢着给周恩来等戴上红领巾，并且请客人们参观他们的游艺场所。越、中儿童的歌咏队分别为客人们演唱了“胡志明颂”、“东方红”和“中国少年先锋队之歌”。一个大约有五十名儿童组成的儿童管弦乐团的精采演奏，获得了客人们的一致赞扬。
    新华社河内20日电　周恩来总理偕贺龙副总理等一行今天下午在河内市行政委员会主席陈维兴和越南工业部部长黎清毅陪同下，参观了河内郊外的统一火柴厂和嘉林火车修理厂。
    嘉林火车修理厂是越南著名的工厂，它的工人是越南独立斗争中一支坚强的先锋队。统一火柴厂是河内重新解放后，在中国援助下建立起来的一个新工厂，是越南唯一的机制火柴厂，它所生产的火柴除可以供应整个越南而外，还能有若干出口。这两个工厂中目前都有若干中国的技术专家和技术工人在协助工作。
    这两个工厂的工人都举行了盛大的集会来欢迎周恩来。两个工厂的负责人在致欢迎词的时候，都表示感谢中国同志给他们的帮助。
    周恩来在讲话中特别指出，中国支援越南建设是应当的。越南的繁荣强大是对中越两国人民共同有利的。中国专家在工作中应当不断检查自己的缺点，改进自己的工作，为越南人民服务得更好，并且学习越南人民的各种优点，以求得共同提高。他最后祝贺中越两国工人阶级和两国人民的团结和友谊一天比一天巩固和密切。
    工人以极大的热情为周恩来的讲话欢呼，最后并且高唱“团结就是力量”，欢送周恩来离开工厂。
