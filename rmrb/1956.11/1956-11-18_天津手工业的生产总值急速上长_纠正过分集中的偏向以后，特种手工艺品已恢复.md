Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 17th. The total output value of Tianjin's handicraft industry system had already reached the 1957 level by the end of September this year. This was a statistic compiled by the Tianjin Handicraft Cooperative Union in early November.

This year, after individual handicraftsmen in Tianjin achieved collectivization, their enthusiasm for production soared, and technology has also been continuously improved. Industries such as hardware, tools, agricultural machinery, and vehicle equipment have added 446 machine tools such as lathes, milling machines, and planers. Currently, 21% of the cooperative members have implemented mechanized or semi-mechanized production. The labor productivity of handicraft workers in the city has increased by 50% compared to 1952 and has exceeded the 1957 target.

This year, Tianjin's handicraft departments also produced more than 890,000 pieces of new-style agricultural implements that had never been made or rarely made in the past, such as sprayers, powder applicators, lightweight weeders, iron bed chaff cutters, and seed mixers. To meet the needs of industrial production development, many handicraft cooperatives have also provided a large number of new parts and accessories for textile machines, dyeing and finishing machines, cutting machine tools, automobiles, and trains.

Handicraft cooperatives producing cotton cloth, shoes, hats, and other items have begun producing many higher-grade commodities this year, such as silk-patterned wool fabrics, Wenger fabrics, high-grade tribute fabrics, as well as lambskin and long-pile velvet hats, and high-grade leather shoes, to meet market needs.

However, in the high tide of cooperation, Tianjin's handicraft cooperative organizations, due to blindly establishing large cooperatives, centralized production, and unified management, experienced a decrease in the variety of certain products, an excessive consolidation of service points in the repair service industry, causing dissatisfaction among the masses, and even a decrease in the income of some cooperative members. After several months of correcting the tendency of over-concentration, the production of many special handicraft products and handicrafts has been restored to meet the needs of urban and rural people. At the same time, the number of service points has also increased compared to the past. Thanks to the enthusiasm of cooperative members, labor productivity has increased, and the income of cooperative members has also increased.

    天津手工业的生产总值急速上长
    纠正过分集中的偏向以后，特种手工艺品已恢复
    新华社天津17日电　天津市手工业系统的生产总值，已经在今年9月底提前达到1957年的水平。这是天津市手工业合作社联合总社在11月上旬统计出来的。
    今年，天津市个体手工业者在实现了合作化以后，生产积极性高涨，技术也不断改进。五金、工具、农械、车具等行业已经增加了四百四十六台车床、铣床、刨床等机器设备。目前已有21％的社员实行了机械化或半机械化生产。全市手工业工人的劳动生产率比1952年提高了50％，并已超过了1957年的指标。
    今年天津市手工业部门还生产了八十九万多件过去从来没有做过或很少做过的喷雾器、喷粉器、轻便耘锄、铁床铡刀、拌种器等新式农具。适应工业生产发展的需要，许多手工业合作社也给纺织机、染整机、切削机床、汽车、火车等提供了大量新的零件配件。
    棉布、鞋帽等手工业合作社，今年开始生产了许多较高级的商品，如绢纹呢、文格呢、高贡呢，以及羔皮、长毛绒制成的帽子，高级皮革制成的鞋子等，供应市场需要。
    但是，天津市手工业合作组织在合作化的高潮中，由于盲目办大社，集中生产，统一经营，曾发生某些产品的花色品种一度减少，修理服务性行业的服务点合并过多，引起群众不满，甚至部分社员的收入也降低了。经过几个月来纠正过分集中的偏向以后，已经恢复了许多特殊手工业产品和手工艺品的生产，适应城乡人民的需要。同时，服务点也比过去增多了。由于发挥了社员的生产积极性，提高了劳动生产率，社员的收入也有所增加。
