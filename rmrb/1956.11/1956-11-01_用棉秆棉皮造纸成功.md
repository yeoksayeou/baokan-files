Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 29th. The Tianjin Municipal Paper Industry Company has successfully trial-produced kraft paper using cotton stalks and cottonseed hulls as raw materials. This paper is clean and glossy, and has stronger tensile strength than kraft paper made from bamboo pulp or cement bags. The company is also preparing to trial-produce striped kraft paper for export using cotton stalks and cottonseed hulls, in order to replace a portion of wood pulp.

The main raw materials used by the Tianjin Municipal Paper Industry, such as bamboo pulp, wood pulp, and cement bags, must be transported from Hunan, Jiangxi, Jilin and other places. Since the beginning of this year, the supply of these raw materials has been very limited and difficult to obtain; while cotton stalks and cottonseed hulls are raw materials that can be supplied in large quantities from the vast cotton-producing areas of Hebei, Shandong, and other provinces.

The Tianjin Municipal Paper Industry Company began constructing a pulp workshop using cotton stalks and cottonseed hulls as raw materials within the Zhongda Paper Mill in mid-October. After its completion at the end of the year, it will be able to produce 17 tons of pulp per day. This is the second "locally sourced material" measure taken by the Tianjin paper industry, following the use of rice straw pulp.

    用棉秆棉皮造纸成功
    新华社天津29日电　天津市造纸工业公司采用棉秆、棉皮做原料试制牛皮纸成功。这种纸很洁净又有光泽，比用竹浆、水泥袋做原料制造的牛皮纸拉力强。公司还准备用棉秆、棉皮试制出口的条纹牛皮纸，以便代替一部分木浆。
    天津市造纸工业使用的竹浆、木浆、水泥袋等主要原料，要从湖南、江西、吉林等地运来。今年以来，这些原料的来量极少，供应困难；而棉秆、棉皮是河北、山东等广大棉产区可以大量供应的原料。
    天津市造纸工业公司10月中旬起开始在中达造纸厂内兴建一个用棉秆、棉皮作原料的纸浆车间，年底建成后，每天可生产纸浆十七吨。这是天津市造纸工业采用稻草浆以后的第二个“就地取材”的措施。
