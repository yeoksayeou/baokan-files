Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, November 26th: The Mongolian "Truth Daily" published an editorial on the 25th celebrating the 32nd anniversary of the founding of the Mongolian People's Republic.

The editorial said that the Mongolian People's Republic has made great progress in its economy and culture during the thirty-two years since its founding on November 26, 1924. The livestock formerly owned by feudal lords has been returned to the people. This year, the livestock development plan has been successfully completed by more than 106%, and the current number of livestock is more than double what it was before the revolution. Among them, the livestock of state-owned farms and cooperatives accounts for 18%.

The editorial said that while celebrating the festival, the Mongolian people should further consolidate the unbreakable friendship between Mongolia and the Soviet Union, and people will not forget the great help the Soviet Union has given to Mongolia. At the same time, Mongolia's friendly relations with China and other people's democracies are also developing.

The editorial said that despite the imperialist obstruction of Mongolia's accession to the United Nations, the Mongolian people believe that Mongolia will certainly be able to enjoy its legitimate rights.
