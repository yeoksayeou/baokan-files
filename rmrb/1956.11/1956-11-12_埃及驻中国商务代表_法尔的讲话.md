    Egyptian Commercial Representative to China
    Farr's Speech

    Sun Yat-sen's heroic struggle against domestic feudalism and foreign imperialist powers' attempts to divide China into their spheres of influence is worthy of study by the leaders of all oppressed countries who are striving for national independence and freedom.

    Dr. Sun devoted forty years to the cause of the people's revolution, with the sole aim of elevating China to a free and equal international standing. These forty years of experience convinced Dr. Sun that to achieve this goal, it was necessary to thoroughly awaken the Chinese people and unite with all the peoples of the world who treated China as an equal, to fight together.

    Dr. Sun tirelessly guided the Chinese people, constantly enhancing their patriotic spirit and national consciousness. The more setbacks he suffered, the more closely his followers rallied around him.

    Dr. Sun died relatively poor. He toiled for forty years to win freedom and equality for China. He is the father of New China and one of the most outstanding leaders in history.

    Dr. Sun's lifelong tireless struggle is a great example for all oppressed countries around the world living under the heavy shackles of imperialism to follow.

    We Egyptians have solemnly sworn: we will never give up our fight, we will fight until all Egyptian territory is liberated. Setbacks and defeats in the course of achieving this goal, like Dr. Sun's example—will only increase our spiritual strength, enabling us to fight to the end until we win the freedom and liberation of all of Egypt.

    埃及驻中国商务代表
    法尔的讲话
    孙中山先生反对国内封建主义和反对外国帝国主义列强把中国瓜分为其势力范围的英勇斗争，是值得一切正在为争取祖国独立和自由的被压迫国家的领袖们学习的。
    孙先生致力人民革命事业四十年，其目的只有一个，就是要把中国提高到自由和平等的国际地位。这四十年的经验使孙先生坚信，要达到这个目的，必须彻底唤起中国人民，并联合世界上一切以平等对待中国的人民，共同奋斗。
    孙先生以不倦的努力引导中国人民，使他们的爱国精神和民族意识不断地提高。他遭受挫折越多，他的追随者越是紧密地团结在他的周围。
    孙先生逝世时是比较贫困的。他劳累了整整四十年，为的是争取中国的自由和平等。他是新中国的父亲，是历史上最杰出的领袖之一。
    孙先生毕生不倦的斗争，是生活在帝国主义沉重枷锁下的全世界各被压迫国家都应追随的伟大榜样。
    我们埃及人已经庄严宣誓：我们永远不会放弃我们的战斗，我们要战斗到埃及的全部领土获得自由解放之时。在争取这一目标过程中的挫折和失利，就像孙先生的范例一样——只会增加我们的精神力量，使我们斗争到底，直到我们赢得全埃及的自由解放。
