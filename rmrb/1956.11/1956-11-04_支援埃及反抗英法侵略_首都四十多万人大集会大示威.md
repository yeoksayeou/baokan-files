Xinhua News Agency, 3rd -- Today, more than 400,000 people in Beijing held a powerful mass rally in front of Tiananmen to support Egypt's resistance against Anglo-French aggression, followed by a demonstration.

    People were in high spirits today. Over 400,000 people raised over 400,000 fists in front of Tiananmen, shouting: "Anglo-French invading troops immediately withdraw from Egypt!" "Full support for the just struggle of the Egyptian people!" This voice resounded like thunder on the largest street in Beijing, stretching over ten li.

    It seems that yesterday's parade of over 100,000 people was only a prelude. People could not suppress their indignant emotions. They wanted to show the strength of the victorious Chinese people and express their firm support for Egypt's aspirations. At ten o'clock this morning, the demonstration teams flocked to Tiananmen.

    Farmers from the suburbs set off for Tiananmen at six o'clock in the morning. Workers from industrial and mining areas and farmers from rural areas more than a hundred li away from Beijing gathered in Beijing by train, car, and various means of transportation. On Tiananmen Square, the slogans rose and fell like surging waves. By 2 p.m., the masses participating in the rally and demonstration had packed Tiananmen Square and the streets on both the east and west sides of the square. However, people continued to flock here to participate in the rally. At this time, the mass rally began. Guo Moruo, Li Jishen, Shen Junru, Huang Yanpei, Peng Zhen, and leaders of the Chinese Communist Party, various democratic parties, and people's organizations, as well as Egyptian Ambassador to China Ragab and embassy staff, appeared on the Tiananmen gate tower. People welcomed them with thunderous applause.

    This grand mass rally was jointly held by the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and the Beijing branch, various democratic parties, and people's organizations.

    After the agenda of the meeting was announced, Guo Moruo began to speak. He said that the mass rally we are holding today is a rally to support Egypt and resist Anglo-French aggression. Guo Moruo said: "Today we want to announce to the world: Britain and France are shameful aggressors! Britain and France are shameful culprits for destroying peace!"

    Guo Moruo said passionately: We, the 600 million Chinese people, support the government's statement. We will work with all peace-loving and just countries and people in the world to resolutely stop the Anglo-French armed provocation against Egypt, Arab countries, and world peace. We must uphold justice, defend world peace, and never give up until we reach our goal!

    Peng Zhen, member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and First Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the CPC, severely condemned the Anglo-French imperialists' aggression against Egypt in his speech. He said: The Anglo-French imperialists' armed aggression against Egypt is not only a provocation against the Egyptian people, an attack on the Egyptian people, but also a provocation and attack on all oppressed people in the world, a provocation and attack on countries and people who have been liberated from imperialist rule, and a provocation and attack on all peace-loving countries and people in the world. We, the entire people of Beijing, and we, the 600 million people of China, resolutely support the just struggle of the Egyptian people, resolutely oppose the provocations and attacks of the imperialist aggressors, and resolutely oppose the threat of the imperialist aggressors to world peace. He said that the imperialists can launch a war of aggression against Egypt today, and they can attack China and other Asian and African countries tomorrow. Moreover, they have armed aggression against China in the past and invaded many other Asian and African countries. Until now, the United States is still armed and occupying our sacred territory of Taiwan. Peng Zhen pointed out: The Anglo-French imperialists' aggression against the Egyptian people is a serious challenge to the 1.6 billion people of Asia and Africa. Workers, farmers, students, and people from all walks of life in Beijing have successively held parades and demonstrations to support our government's solemn statement condemning Anglo-French armed aggression against Egypt, resolutely oppose Anglo-French armed aggression, and support Egypt's just struggle. Our support for Egypt is also to safeguard the independence and sovereignty of our country and other Asian and African countries, and to safeguard Asian and African peace and world peace. Peng Zhen concluded: "We, the Chinese people, will stand with the Egyptian people and the Arab people to wage a persistent struggle against the Anglo-French aggressors' offensive and give the Egyptian people resolute support. Demand that Britain and France and Israel immediately stop their military aggression against Egypt. We firmly believe that final victory will surely belong to the Egyptian people. The Anglo-French imperialists and all aggressors who play with fire will burn themselves and eventually eat their own bitter fruit."

    Li Jishen, Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, Bao Erhan, Director of the China Islamic Association, Zhang Bojun, Vice Chairman of the China Democratic League, Huang Yanpei, Chairman of the China Democratic National Construction Association, Chen Shutong, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, Mao Dun, Vice Chairman of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, Ma Xulun, Chairman of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, Lai Ruoyu, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, Li Dequan, Vice Chairman of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, Hu Yaobang, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League and head of the All-China Youth Federation, Huang Qixiang, Secretary-General of the Central Committee of the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party, Chen Qiyou, Chairman of the China Zhi Gong Party, Liang Xi, Vice Chairman of the Jiusan Society, Xie Xuehong, Chairman of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League, and Hu Qili, Chairman of the All-China Students' Federation, also spoke at the meeting.

    When Egyptian Ambassador to China Ragab spoke, Tiananmen Square resounded with long and thunderous applause. Ragab said: Egypt's nationalization of the Suez Canal did not violate anyone's rights, but this made the imperialists unhappy. The imperialists ignited the flames of war in our peace-loving country. They can do anything. They may burn all the cities and factories in Egypt and slaughter tens of thousands of innocent Egyptian children, but the fighting spirit of the Egyptian people cannot be killed by any powerful weapon.

    Ragab said: "When I saw hundreds of thousands of friendly Chinese brothers leaving their work in such cold weather to come here to hold mass rallies to express their support for the just struggle of the Egyptian people, I believe that we, the Egyptian people, are not isolated in this just struggle."

    During Ragab's speech, waves of stormy applause and slogans continuously resounded in the crowd spanning several miles.

    Ragab finally shouted slogans such as "Long live Egyptian-Chinese friendship!" and the masses on the square shouted in unison with him.

    Hamroush, a reporter from the Egyptian Republic newspaper, spoke last. People also welcomed this Egyptian friend from a heroic country with bursts of applause and slogans.

    Then, more than 400,000 people from all walks of life in the capital who participated in the conference unanimously adopted a telegram to support the Egyptian people's resistance against Anglo-French aggression and a telegram to protest Anglo-French armed aggression against Egypt.

    The conference ended at 4:25 pm, and the demonstration began. Dozens of demonstration teams turned east in unison like a tide, heading towards the Egyptian Embassy and the British Chargé d'Affaires Office.

    Guo Moruo, Zhang Bojun, Bao Erhan, Shao Lizi, Zhu Xuefan, Wang Shaoao, Liao Chengzhi and others walked at the forefront of the parade heading towards the Egyptian Embassy in China. In front of the embassy, ​​Guo Moruo and Zhang Bojun led the demonstrators to shout: "Resolutely oppose Anglo-French imperialist aggression against Egypt!" "Anglo-French invading troops immediately withdraw from Egypt!" "Support the heroic struggle of Egypt!" "We stand with the Egyptian people!"

    Guo Moruo and others entered the Egyptian Embassy and met with Ragab, the Egyptian Ambassador to China.

    Guo Moruo told the ambassador that more than 400,000 people participated in today's conference, and the enthusiasm they expressed represents the people of Beijing and the 600 million people of China. On behalf of the more than 400,000 Beijing people who participated in the conference, Guo Moruo expressed to the ambassador the firm determination to actively support Egypt, and at the same time expressed on behalf of the entire Chinese people the firm determination to support the Egyptian people. He asked the ambassador to convey his regards to President Nasser and the Egyptian people from the people of Beijing and all of China.

    The Egyptian ambassador thanked the Chinese people for their enthusiasm on behalf of the entire Egyptian people. He said: It is certain that when the Egyptian people know the enthusiasm of the Chinese people, they will be greatly encouraged. The Egyptian people are fighting for justice. We may fail in some aspects, but final victory will surely belong to the Egyptian people.

    As the demonstrating masses continued to pass in front of the Egyptian Embassy, ​​people kept running out of the parade and handing over letters of support for the Egyptian struggle to Ambassador Ragab.

    The British Chargé d'Affaires Office in China was submerged in angry slogans from the demonstrators. The demonstrators installed nine strings of megaphones here. Millions of people shouted in unison: "Anglo-French aggressor troops immediately withdraw from Egypt!" Cartoons and protest letters were plastered all over the walls in front of the British Chargé d'Affaires Office. The demonstrators planted many triangular flags with words about opposing the war of aggression in the garden of the British Chargé d'Affaires Office.

    The demonstrating masses sent protest letters to the Chargé d'Affaires Office one after another, and the British people here took them and said repeatedly: "We will definitely forward them to the British government."

    Chen Shutong, Lai Ruoyu, Liu Ningyi, and Hu Yaobang, together with some representatives of the demonstrators, shouted angrily in front of the British Chargé d'Affaires Office: "Oppose the war of aggression!" Countless protest slogans and cartoons were held high in the hands of the demonstrators, who sang "Defend World Peace" to demonstrate to Anglo-French imperialism.

    In the parade, many women walked past the gate of the British Chargé d'Affaires Office, stomping their feet and shouting loudly: "Defend peace!". They said indignantly, we and our children love peace, we resolutely oppose your aggression against Egypt!

    Today, the whole city is angry! When the live broadcast of the rally to support Egypt against Anglo-French aggression was transmitted from the loudspeakers to the streets, every household turned on the radio to listen. Many cars and bicycles that were driving stopped, and people stood under the loudspeakers to listen quietly to the storm-like voices of protest. When the loud voice of Egyptian Ambassador Ragab was broadcast, some workers who were building roads near Xidan said, let the imperialists listen to the voice of the Egyptian representative! Egypt will not be destroyed.

    Today, some white-haired old ladies, old men, and mothers holding children also appeared in front of the loudspeakers. At the end of the conference, some people came out of the small alleys and joined the demonstration.

    Until 8 pm, the demonstrators in some places had not dispersed. (Attached picture)

    支援埃及反抗英法侵略
    首都四十多万人大集会大示威
    新华社3日讯　今天，北京市四十多万人在天安门前举行了一个声势强大的支援埃及反抗英法侵略群众大会，会后进行了示威游行。
    人们今天情绪激昂，四十多万人在天安门前举起了四十多万个拳头，他们高呼：“英法侵略军队立刻从埃及撤退！”“全力支持埃及人民的正义斗争！”这个声音像巨雷似的震响在北京的一条长约十多华里的最大的街道上。
    看来，昨天十万多人的游行仅仅是一个序幕，人们压抑不住激愤的情绪，他们要表示胜利的中国人民的力量，表示坚决支持埃及的意愿，今天上午十时示威的队伍就纷纷向天安门集中。
    郊区的农民在清晨六时就动身奔向天安门。离北京城百里以外的工矿区的职工们和农村的农民们，乘着火车、汽车和各种交通工具汇集到北京城内。在天安门广场上，此起彼伏的口号声像海涛一样的汹涌。下午二时，参加大会和示威的群众已经把天安门广场和广场东西两头的大街上挤得水泄不通，然而，参加大会的人们仍然源源向这里云集。这时，群众大会开始，郭沫若、李济深、沈钧儒、黄炎培、彭真和中国共产党、中国各民主党派、各人民团体的负责人以及埃及驻中国大使拉加布和使馆人员等出现在天安门城楼。人们用暴风雨般的掌声来欢迎他们。
    这个盛大的群众集会是由中国人民保卫世界和平委员会及北京市分会、中国各民主党派、各人民团体联合举行的。
    大会宣布了议程后，郭沫若开始讲话，他说，我们今天所举行的这个群众大会，是支援埃及和反抗英法侵略的大会。郭沫若说：“今天我们要向全世界宣布：英国和法国是可耻的侵略者！英国和法国是可耻的破坏和平的罪魁！”
    郭沫若激昂地说：我们中国六亿人民拥护政府的声明。我们要和全世界一切爱好和平和正义的国家和人民一起，坚决制止英法对埃及、对阿拉伯国家和对世界和平的武装挑衅。我们要伸张正义，保卫世界和平，不达目的，决不罢休！
    中共中央政治局委员、中共北京市委第一书记彭真在讲话中严厉谴责了英、法帝国主义者侵略埃及的行为。他说：英、法帝国主义对埃及的武装侵略，不仅是对埃及人民的挑衅、对埃及人民的进攻，也是对世界一切被压迫人民的挑衅和进攻，是对已经从帝国主义统治下解放出来的国家和人民的挑衅和进攻，也是对全世界一切爱好和平的国家和人民的挑衅和进攻。我们北京市全体人民，我们全中国六亿人民坚决支持埃及人民的正义斗争，坚决反对帝国主义侵略者的挑衅和进攻，坚决反对帝国主义侵略者对世界和平的威胁。他说，帝国主义者今天可以向埃及进行侵略战争，明天也可以向中国和亚非其他国家进攻，而且他们过去曾经武装侵略过中国，侵略过亚非其他许多国家，直到现在美国还武装霸占着我们的神圣领土台湾。彭真指出：英法帝国主义对埃及人民的侵略，是对十六亿亚非人民的严重挑战。北京市的工人、农民、学生和其他各界人民连日已经纷纷举行了游行示威，拥护和支持我国政府谴责英法武装侵略埃及的严正声明，坚决反对英法的武装侵略，支持埃及的正义斗争。我们支援埃及也就是维护我国和亚非各国的独立和主权，维护亚非和平和世界和平。彭真最后说：“我们中国人民将同埃及人民和阿拉伯人民一道，为反对英法侵略者的进攻，进行坚持不懈的斗争，给予埃及人民以坚决的支持。要求英法两国和以色列立即停止他们对埃及的军事侵略。我们深信最后胜利一定属于埃及人民。英法帝国主义和一切侵略者玩火自焚，最后一定会自食其果。
    相继在大会上讲话的有中国国民党革命委员会主席李济深，中国伊斯兰教协会主任包尔汉，中国民主同盟副主席章伯钧，中国民主建国会主任委员黄炎培，中华全国工商业联合会主任委员陈叔通，中国文学艺术界联合会副主席茅盾，中国民主促进会主席马叙伦，中华全国总工会主席赖若愚，中华全国民主妇女联合会副主席李德全，中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会书记处书记、中华全国民主青年联合会负责人胡耀邦，中国农工民主党中央委员会秘书长黄琪翔，中国致公党主席陈其尤，九三学社副主席梁希，台湾民主自治同盟主席谢雪红和中国学生联合会主席胡启立。
    当埃及驻中国大使拉加布讲话的时候，天安门广场响起了长久的雷鸣般的掌声。拉加布说：埃及把苏伊士运河收归国有，并没有侵犯任何人的权利，但是这件事使帝国主义者不高兴，帝国主义者在我们爱好和平的国家燃起了战争的火焰。他们什么事都可能干得出来，他们可能烧毁埃及所有的城市和工厂，屠杀成千成万无辜的埃及儿童，但是埃及人民斗争的精神是任何厉害的武器也不能杀死的。
    拉加布说：“当我看到几十万友好的中国弟兄在这样寒冷的天气丢着自己的工作到这儿来开群众大会，表示支持埃及人民的正义斗争的时候，我相信我们埃及人民在这个正义斗争中不是孤立的。”
    在拉加布讲话的时候，在数里路长的人群中连绵不断地响起风暴般的掌声和口号声。
    拉加布最后高呼埃中友谊万岁等口号时，广场上的群众和他同声高呼。
    埃及共和国报记者哈姆路希最后讲话。人们同样以阵阵的掌声和口号声来欢迎这位来自英雄国家的埃及朋友。
    接着，参加大会的四十多万首都各界人民一致通过了支援埃及人民反抗英法侵略的电文和抗议英法武装侵略埃及的电文。
    四时二十五分大会结束，示威游行开始。几十路的示威队伍像海潮一样不约而同地转向东方，向埃及大使馆和英国驻华代办处方向走去。
    向埃及驻中国大使馆方向前进的游行队伍，郭沫若、章伯钧、包尔汉、邵力子、朱学范、王绍鏊、廖承志等走在队伍的最前面。郭沫若、章伯钧在大使馆门前领导示威群众高呼：“坚决反对英法帝国主义侵略埃及！”“英法侵略军队立刻撤出埃及！”“支持埃及的英勇斗争！”“我们同埃及人民站在一起！”
    郭沫若等走进了埃及大使馆，同埃及驻中国大使拉加布会见。
    郭沫若对大使说，参加今天大会的群众超过四十万人，他们所表示的热情，代表了北京市人民和全中国六亿人民。郭沫若代表参加大会的四十多万北京人民，向大使表示积极支持埃及的坚定的决心，同时代表全中国人民表示支持埃及人民的坚定的决心。他请大使向纳赛尔总统和埃及人民转达北京和全中国人民的致意。
    埃及大使以全体埃及人民的名义，感谢中国人民的热情。他说：肯定的说，当埃及人民知道中国人民的热情后，一定会得到很大的鼓舞，埃及人民是在为正义斗争，我们可能在某些方面失败，但最后胜利一定属于埃及人民。
    游行示威的群众源源不断地通过埃及大使馆门前时，不断有人从游行队伍里跑出来，把一封又一封支援埃及斗争的信交给拉加布大使。
    英国驻华代办处被示威群众愤怒的口号声淹没了。示威的人们在这里装上了九个一串的扩音器。千万人齐声高呼：“英法侵略军立即从埃及撤出去！”漫画、抗议书贴满了英国代办处门前的墙壁。示威的人在英国代办处的花园里，插上了许多写着有关反对侵略战争字样的三角形旗子。
    游行的群众把抗议书纷纷送到代办处，这里的英国人接到手里连声说：“我们一定转给英国政府。”
    陈叔通、赖若愚、刘宁一、胡耀邦同一些示威群众的代表在英国代办处门前愤怒地喊着：“反对侵略战争！”数不清的抗议标语和漫画高举在示威群众的手中，他们高唱着“保卫世界和平”的歌曲，向英、法帝国主义示威。
    在游行队伍里，很多妇女走过英国代办处的门口，跺着双脚，高声喊着：“保卫和平！”。她们愤慨地说，我们和我们的孩子都热爱和平，我们坚决反对你们侵略埃及！
    今天，整个城市愤怒了！当支援埃及反对英法侵略大会的实况从扩音器里传到街头的时候，家家户户打开收音机收听。许多正在行驶的汽车和自行车都停下来，人们停立在扩音器下静听那像风暴一样的抗议的声音。当埃及大使拉加布宏亮的演说声传出时，在西单附近一些正在修筑马路的工人说，让帝国主义者听听埃及代表的声音吧！埃及是不会被消灭的。
    今天，一些白发的老太太、老翁和抱着孩子的母亲也出现在扩音器前，在大会结束的时候，一些人从小胡同里出来随着走进示威群众队伍。
    直到晚上八时，一些地方的示威群众还没有散去。（附图片）
