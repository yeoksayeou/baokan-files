Xinhua News Agency, November 14th, New York Dispatch: The General Committee of the United Nations General Assembly held a meeting on November 13th to discuss issues related to the agenda of the General Assembly. The General Committee is composed of the President and Vice-Presidents of the General Assembly, as well as representatives from the seven committees of the General Assembly.

On the suggestion of the Indian representative, the meeting first unanimously adopted the inclusion of the issue of the military actions of Britain, France, and Israel against Egypt on the agenda of the General Assembly, and named this item "Issues Discussed at the First Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly."

The meeting then began debating whether to include the so-called Hungarian question on the agenda of the General Assembly. Soviet representative Kuznetsov spoke against the General Assembly's discussion of the Hungarian question. He said that the aim of those advocating discussion of this issue in the General Assembly is to use provocative clamoring surrounding the Hungarian events to divert the attention of the world public and the General Assembly from the armed aggression against Egypt by Britain, France, and Israel, encouraged by the United States. They are attempting to evade their responsibility for the crimes of barbarically bombing Egyptian cities, brutally killing peaceful residents, and greatly intensifying the international situation.

Kuznetsov said that, as a result of the efforts of those countries that desire peace, there has been a considerable easing of world tensions. People have begun to shake off fear and suspicion. The prospect of peaceful coexistence among all nations seemed to be in sight. However, this situation has been replaced by an intensified international tension. The main reason lies in the fact that international reactionary and aggressive forces have resorted to force, attempting to flex their muscles in Egypt in the East and Hungary in the West. The events that occurred in Hungary were an attempt by reactionary forces to exploit a mass movement to achieve their reactionary aims.

Kuznetsov said that the Government of the Hungarian People's Republic has protested more than once against the discussion of the so-called Hungarian question in the United Nations, because this issue is purely an internal affair of the Hungarian People's Republic. Attempts to use the United Nations platform to incite around this issue will only benefit reactionary forces, only complicate the work of Hungary in consolidating peace and order as quickly as possible under the leadership of its new government, and add difficulties to it.

Kuznetsov also protested against the General Committee's discussion of this issue in the absence of a Hungarian representative, and he suggested inviting representatives of the Hungarian Revolutionary Worker-Peasant Government to attend the meeting and express their views.

Czechoslovak representative Peterka also opposed including the so-called Hungarian question on the agenda of the General Assembly. He said that now, when the Hungarian government's measures to normalize the situation are being rapidly implemented, discussing this issue would only benefit those who advocate restoring the Horthy regime in Hungary.

Representatives from the United States, Britain, El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, and Peru, as well as Chiang Kai-shek elements, advocated including the so-called Hungarian question on the agenda of the General Assembly.

Under the manipulation of Western countries, the meeting rejected the Soviet representative's proposal to invite Hungarian representatives to attend the discussion, and decided by eleven votes in favor, two votes against (Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia), and one abstention (Egypt) to include the so-called Hungarian question on the agenda of the General Assembly.

After the vote, the meeting proceeded to discuss the allocation of the agenda. Indian representative Menon suggested that the so-called Hungarian question be submitted to the Political Committee of the General Assembly for discussion. Menon said that there were still many ambiguities surrounding the Hungarian events, and that, in addition, this issue was related to the question of assistance to Hungary. The Indian representative believed that the relatively serious and calm atmosphere of the Political Committee would help in discussing the substance of the Hungarian question.

Representatives from the United States and Peru, among other countries, insisted that the Plenary Meeting of the United Nations General Assembly immediately discuss the so-called Hungarian question.

Turkish representative Sarper pointed out that the General Committee could only offer opinions on the allocation of the agenda to the General Assembly, and that the General Assembly must make the final decision. Therefore, the General Committee decided not to make a decision on this issue, leaving it to the General Assembly to decide.

At the end of the meeting, the General Committee also adopted a proposal to the United Nations General Assembly to increase the number of Vice-Presidents of the General Assembly to eight, and to make corresponding amendments to the United Nations Charter.

    在联大总务委员会上
    西方国家坚持立刻讨论匈牙利问题来转移世界舆论注意英法侵略埃及
    新华社14日讯　纽约消息：联合国大会总务委员会11月13日举行会议，讨论了有关大会议程的问题。总务委员会是由大会主席、副主席和大会的七个委员会的代表组成的。
    在印度代表的建议下，会议首先一致通过把英、法和以色列对埃及的军事行动问题列入大会议程，并且把这项议程定名为“大会第一次紧急会议所讨论的问题”。
    会议接着就是否把所谓匈牙利问题列入大会议程展开辩论。苏联代表库兹涅佐夫发言反对大会讨论匈牙利问题。他说，主张在大会上讨论这个问题的人所抱的目的是：用围绕匈牙利事件的挑衅性叫嚷，来转移世界公众和大会对英、法和以色列在美国的鼓励下向埃及进行武装侵略的注意。他们企图逃避他们对野蛮轰炸埃及城市、残暴地杀害和平居民和使国际局势大大紧张这些罪行所负的责任。
    库兹涅佐夫说，由于那些希望和平的国家努力的结果，世界紧张局势有了相当大的缓和。人民已经开始摆脱恐惧和疑心。所有各国人民和平相处的前途看来已经在眼前了。但是，这一情况却被加剧了的国际紧张局势所代替了。主要原因在于：国际上反动与侵略的势力采用了武力，想在东方的埃及和西方的匈牙利耀武扬威。匈牙利所发生的事件就是反动势力利用一次群众运动来达到他们反动的目的的尝试。
    库兹涅佐夫说，匈牙利人民共和国政府已经不止一次抗议在联合国中讨论所谓匈牙利问题，因为这个问题纯粹是匈牙利人民共和国的内政。利用联合国讲坛围绕这个问题来进行煽动的企图只会对反动势力有利，只能使匈牙利在它的新政府领导下最快地巩固和平和秩序的工作复杂化，并且给它增加困难。
    库兹涅佐夫还抗议总务委员会在没有匈牙利代表出席的情况下讨论这个问题，他建议邀请匈牙利工农革命政府的代表出席会议发表意见。
    捷克斯洛伐克代表彼得热尔卡也反对把所谓匈牙利问题列入大会议程。他说，现在，当匈牙利政府使局势正常化的措施正在迅速实现的时候，讨论这个问题只会有利于主张在匈牙利恢复霍尔蒂政权的人。
    美国、英国、萨尔瓦多、多米尼加和秘鲁的代表以及蒋介石分子主张把所谓匈牙利问题列入大会议程。
    在西方国家的操纵下，会议否决了苏联代表提出的关于邀请匈牙利代表出席讨论的建议，并且以十一票赞成、两票反对（苏联和捷克斯洛伐克）、一票弃权（埃及）决定把所谓匈牙利问题列入大会议程。
    在表决后，会议接着讨论分配议程的问题。印度代表梅农建议把所谓匈牙利问题提交大会的政治委员会讨论，梅农说，在匈牙利事件上，还有许多模糊的地方，此外，这个问题同援助匈牙利的问题有关。印度代表认为，政治委员会比较认真和平静的气氛有助于讨论匈牙利问题的实质。
    美国和秘鲁等国代表坚持由联合国大会全体会议来立刻讨论所谓匈牙利问题。
    土耳其代表萨佩尔指出，总务委员会只能就议程的分配向大会提出意见，必须由大会来采取最后的决定。于是，总务委员会决定不在这个问题上采取决定，留待大会决定。
    在会议结束的时候，总务委员会还通过了向联合国大会提出关于把大会副主席增加为八人，并且对联合国宪章作相应修改的建议。
