    Be Vigilant Against the Anglo-French Conspiracy to Invade Syria
    While delaying their withdrawal from Egypt, Britain, France, and Israel are intensifying their conspiracy to invade Syria. They are employing various despicable methods to exert brutal pressure on Syria, attempting to provoke a new war of aggression.
    The aggressors' choice of Syria as their new target of aggression is an attempt to divide the unity between Arab countries, restore their colonial rule in the Middle East, and isolate Egypt in its struggle to defend its independence and sovereignty. As everyone knows, since the Suez Canal crisis, Syria has firmly supported the struggle of the Egyptian people. When Britain, France, and Israel launched a war of aggression against Egypt, Syria actively took measures to support Egypt. It severed diplomatic relations with Britain and France. It cut off the oil pipelines of the Iraq Petroleum Company that run through Syrian territory. It firmly demanded the immediate withdrawal of British, French, and Israeli troops from Egypt and stated that if the invading forces refused to withdraw from Egypt, it would not repair the severed pipelines.
    Syria's righteous action of standing in solidarity with Egypt and other Arab countries to resist aggression has received the sympathy and support of all peace-loving countries and people. However, it has infuriated the British and French aggressors, who see Syria as a thorn in their side. After launching the war of aggression against Egypt, they constantly sent military aircraft to violate Syrian airspace, conducting reconnaissance and provocative activities, and firing on Syrian aircraft. After Britain and France were forced to cease fire in Egypt, they immediately incited Israel to amass troops in large numbers on the Syrian border, threatening Syria with war. At the same time, Britain and France instructed the Baghdad Pact countries to exert pressure on Syria. Recently, the Baghdad Pact held two meetings, openly demanding that the Syrian government change its policies. Subsequently, Turkish troops have been frequently mobilized on the Syrian border, preparing to carry out armed intervention against Syria. Iraq is smuggling arms to conspirators within Syria in an attempt to carry out subversive activities in Syria and overthrow the legitimate government of Syria.
    The intensified Anglo-French conspiracy to invade Syria has clearly been encouraged and supported by the United States. The American propaganda machine has been spreading rumors, falsely accusing Syria of "threatening" peace in the Middle East, to echo the Anglo-French aggression.
    The Anglo-French actions of instructing Iraq and other Baghdad Pact countries to provoke a new war in Syria are contrary to the interests of peace in the Middle East, and are not beneficial to the people of any Middle Eastern country. They will only benefit Western colonialists, allowing them to reap the benefits without lifting a finger.
    Facts have proven that the biggest enemy of all Middle Eastern countries today is Western colonialism, and certainly not neighboring brotherly countries. Provoking discord between countries, causing conflicts and wars between countries, is the colonialists' consistent policy of divide and rule in the Middle East. Faced with a formidable enemy, Middle Eastern countries should unite to deal with a common enemy.
    All countries and people who care about peace in the Middle East must be vigilant against the development of the situation in the Middle East caused by the Anglo-French aggressors' refusal to withdraw from Egypt, and resolutely oppose the new acts of aggression against Syria by the Anglo-French aggressors. Because any new incident provoked by Britain and France in the Middle East has the potential to develop into a large-scale war, directly threatening world peace.

### 警惕英法对叙利亚的侵略阴谋

    警惕英法对叙利亚的侵略阴谋
    英、法和以色列在拖延从埃及撤军的同时，正在加紧策划对叙利亚的侵略阴谋。它们采取各种卑鄙的办法，对叙利亚施行粗暴的压力，企图挑起新的侵略战争。
    侵略者选择叙利亚作为它们新的侵略对象，是企图分裂阿拉伯国家之间的团结，恢复它们在中东地区的殖民统治，并使埃及在保卫自己的独立和主权的斗争中孤立起来。大家知道，自苏伊士运河问题发生以来，叙利亚就坚决支持埃及人民的斗争。当英、法和以色列对埃及发动侵略战争以后，叙利亚又积极采取措施来支援埃及。它同英法断绝了外交关系。它切断了流经叙利亚领土上的伊拉克石油公司油管。它坚决要求英、法和以色列军队立即撤离埃及，并表示如果侵略军拒不撤出埃及，就不修复被切断的油管。
    叙利亚这种同埃及等阿拉伯国家团结一致反抗侵略的正义行动，得到了所有爱好和平的国家和人民的同情和支持。可是，却触怒了英、法侵略者，它们把叙利亚看作它们的眼中钉。它们在发动对埃及的侵略战争以后，便不断派遣军用飞机侵犯叙利亚的领空，进行侦察挑衅活动，并向叙利亚飞机开火。英、法在埃及被迫停火以后，它们立即唆使以色列在叙利亚边界大量集结兵力，对叙利亚进行战争威胁。同时，英、法又指使巴格达集团国家对叙利亚施加压力。最近以来，巴格达集团两次集会，公开要求叙利亚政府改变政策。接着，土耳其军队在叙利亚边境调动频繁，准备对叙利亚进行武装干涉。伊拉克私运军火给叙利亚境内的阴谋分子，企图在叙利亚进行颠覆活动，推翻叙利亚的合法政府。
    英、法加紧策划对叙利亚的侵略活动，显然得到了美国的怂恿和支持。美国的宣传机构已在大肆造谣，污蔑叙利亚“威胁”中东和平，以与英法的侵略活动相呼应。
    英、法指使伊拉克和巴格达集团其它国家，企图在叙利亚挑起新战争的行动，是违背中东地区和平的利益的，对所有中东国家人民都没有任何好处，而只会有利于西方殖民主义者，使它们坐收渔利。
    事实证明，今天所有中东国家最大的敌人是西方殖民主义者，而绝不是毗邻而居的兄弟国家。挑拨各国之间的团结，引起各国之间的冲突和战争，这是殖民主义者对中东国家分而治之的一贯政策。大敌当前，中东国家应该团结起来对付共同的敌人。
    一切关心中东和平的国家和人民，都要警惕英、法侵略者拒绝从埃及撤军所引起的中东局势的发展，并坚决反对英、法侵略者对叙利亚所进行的新的侵略活动。因为英、法在中东地区挑起任何新的事件，都有发展成为大规模战争的可能，直接威胁着世界和平。
