Poetry Collection from a Visit to Egypt
    Ma Hanbing

    On the Nile
    I love the Nile in the daytime,
    Sunlight shines on the yellow sails,
    I have spent cool nights on the riverbank,
    The lights of Cairo shine through the luxurious curtains.

    Along the neat riverside avenue,
    I stepped into the threshold of my friends' homes,
    The banquet in the west building hasn't ended,
    Someone is strumming the strings in the east building.

    Who is singing "Egypt - my mother,"
    The singing floats with the white clouds to the distant mountain peaks,
    I opened the window of the west building,
    The Nile flows gurglingly before my eyes.

    Words of Hussein, Governor of the Egyptian Liberation Province
    The government of the Egyptian Republic once diverted water and built a large-scale farm in the Gobi desert more than 200 kilometers from Cairo. In order to strengthen this reclamation work, the Egyptian government specifically designated this place as the Liberation Province. This past April, we visited this new province. Lieutenant Colonel Hussein, the governor of the province, once said the following to us. I am merely stringing his words together without adding much modification - the author.

    "A few years ago, this place was still desolate,
    Everywhere there were tigers, wolves, and wild sheep,
    If you came here alone,
    Don't hope to be able to return home.

    We cannot let the motherland's land be barren forever,
    Even in the sandy land, we must plant seedlings;
    We cannot let our people be poor forever,
    The children must wear gorgeous clothes.

    "There is no colonialist capital here,
    There is no need for 'experts' from colonial democracies to help,
    Relying on our two rough palms,
    We will turn thousands of miles of sandy beach into a farm.

    We do what we say,
    Now the wheat sprouts are fragrant across the fields.
    People's labor is not in vain,
    The yellow land shines with the golden light of happiness."

    The Voice of an Egyptian Soldier
    In Egypt, I met a young composer named Altula Said. He loves his nation and motherland and has written many songs praising his country. On the eve of his conscription into the army, he came to my residence to chat. Talking about the situation around Egypt, he deeply felt that the flames of war had approached the gates of Egypt. He was extremely angry and asked me to compile his words into lyrics for a song, so that he could compose music and teach it in the army to encourage soldiers to defend Egypt, defend the Asia-Africa region, and world peace. Below are the lyrics I helped him write. - the author.

    Who says the world is already peaceful,
    Colonialists are still running rampant,
    The flames of war in Cyprus are raging,
    Gunshots have been heard from Algeria.

    On the land of our motherland,
    Shadows of demons have already appeared,
    My brothers, my relatives,
    Can no longer sleep soundly.

    If war is inevitable,
    We don't need to be frightened,
    Pick up all weapons,
    And fight with our blood and skulls.

    访埃诗抄
    马寒冰
    尼罗河畔
    我爱尼罗河的白天，
    阳光照耀着黄色的船帆，
    我曾在河畔上度过了凉爽的夜晚，
    开罗的灯火透过华丽的窗帘。
    沿着整洁的河边大道，
    我夸进了朋友们的门槛，
    西楼上的宴会还没有结束，
    东楼里有人在拨弄着琴弦。
    是谁在唱着“埃及——我的母亲”，
    歌声随着白云飘向遥远的山巅，
    打开了西楼的窗户，
    尼罗河水潺潺地流过我的眼前。
    埃及解放省长胡赛因的话语
    埃及共和国政府曾经在距离开罗二百多公里的戈壁沙滩上，开渠引水，修建了一个规模宏大的农场。为着加强这个开垦工作，埃及政府特把这个地方划为解放省。今年四月间，我们访问过这个新的行省。该省省长胡赛因中校，曾对我们说过下列的话语，我仅仅把他的话语连串在一起，没有加以更多的修饰——作者。
    “几年前这里还是一片荒凉，
    到处有着虎狼和野羊，
    如果你单独来到这里，
    不要希望能够返回家乡。
    不能让祖国的土地永远荒废，
    那怕是沙子地里也要插上苗秧；
    不能让我们的人民永远贫困，
    孩子们要穿上华丽的衣裳。
    “这里没有殖民主义者的资本，
    用不着殖民民主者的‘专家’来帮忙，
    就凭着我们两只粗糙的手掌，
    也要把千里沙滩变成农场。
    我们的话说到做到，
    如今田连阡陌麦芽香。
    人们的劳动没有白费掉，
    黄色的土地闪耀着幸福的金光。”
    埃及士兵的声音
    在埃及，我认识了一位叫阿尔都拉·赛义德的青年作曲家，他热爱着自己的民族和祖国，写过好多歌颂祖国的歌曲。在他被征调入伍的前夜，他到我的住处来聊天，谈起了埃及周围的情况，他深深地感到战争的火焰，已经迫近埃及的大门。他万分气愤，他要求我把他的话语，编成一首歌词，让他谱成曲子带到军队教唱，以便激励士兵去保卫埃及，保卫亚非地区和世界的和平。下面就是我帮他编写的歌词。——作者。
    谁说世界已经平静，
    殖民主义者仍在横行，
    塞浦路斯的战火熊熊，
    阿尔及利亚传来了枪声。
    在我们祖国的大地上，
    已经出现了幢幢魔影，
    我的兄弟，我的亲人，
    再也不能沉睡不醒。
    如果战争不可避免，
    我们也用不着胆战心惊，
    拿起一切武器，
    用我们的热血和头胪去作斗争。
