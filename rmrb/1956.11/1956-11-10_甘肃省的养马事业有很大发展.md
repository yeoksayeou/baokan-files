The horse population in Gansu Province this year has increased by more than 69% compared to 1949.

The province's state-owned ranches and more than a dozen horse farms have played a significant demonstrative and promotional role in the breeding and improvement of horses throughout the province. Under the technical guidance of these ranches and farms, various localities have continuously improved livestock breeds and emphasized disease prevention. As a result, the province's horse population has not only greatly increased but also improved in quality.

Gansu Province is located on the Northwest Loess Plateau, with a vast area of grassland covering more than 210,000 square kilometers, accounting for over 27% of the province's total area. Historically, it has been a region with relatively flourishing horse populations. Emperor Jing of the Han Dynasty established thirty-six horse ranches in the Northwest, most of which were located in Gansu. By the Tang Dynasty, the number of horses in the Gansu region had grown to 700,000.

Gansu Province currently has more than 160,000 people from ethnic minorities such as Tibetans, Mongolians, Yugurs, and Kazakhs, who specialize in animal husbandry production. The vast agricultural and semi-agricultural areas are also home to farmers of all ethnic groups who also engage in animal husbandry. Based on geographical, historical, and ethnic conditions, Gansu Province plans to increase its horse population to 670,000 by 1967, nearly tripling the number from 1949. At that time, Gansu's horses will play a greater role in supporting national defense construction and national economic development. (Li Shengzhen)

    甘肃省的养马事业有很大发展
    本报讯　今年甘肃省的马匹总数比1949年增加了69％以上。
    全省的国营牧场和十几个马场，对全省马匹的繁殖和改良，起到了很大示范推动作用。在牧场和马场的技术指导下，各地不断进行畜种改良，并重视了防疫工作。因此全省的马匹，不但数量大大增加，而且质量也提高了。
    甘肃省位于西北黄土高原，全省大面积的草原约有二十一万多平方公里，占全省总面积的27％以上，历史上就是马匹比较繁盛的地区。汉景帝曾在西北设马苑三十六处，其中大部设在甘肃；到了唐朝，甘肃地区的马匹已发展到七十万匹。
    甘肃省现有藏、蒙、裕固、哈萨克等少数民族十六万多人，专事畜牧业生产；广大农业区和半农半牧区的各族农民也多兼营畜牧业。根据地理、历史、民族条件，甘肃省计划到1967年马要发展到六十七万匹，比1949年增加将近三倍。那时候，甘肃的马对支援国防建设和支援国民经济的发展，将起到更大的作用。　　　（李生桢）
