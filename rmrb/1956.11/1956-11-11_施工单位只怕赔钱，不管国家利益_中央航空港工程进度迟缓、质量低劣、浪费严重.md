Xinhua News Agency, November 8th: Xinhua News Agency reporter Lin Yin reports: The construction of the new Central Airport in Beijing had only completed about 40% of its original annual planned workload by October 15th. The project's progress is too slow, and many important constructions, such as runways, aprons, and drainage ditches and highways have not been completed by the planned dates. Some of these projects have had to be delayed and done in the severe winter, and it is estimated that this will increase winter protection costs and night shift fees by about 320,000 yuan. Some projects unsuitable for winter construction, such as the apron's concrete work, must be postponed until next year if they cannot be completed before November 15th.

The quality of some completed projects is also quite poor. For example, the concrete strength of the most important runway project is insufficient, and cracks have appeared in some places, failing to meet national acceptance standards. Part of the sand foundation under the runway has been washed away by rainwater, and the compactness of the refilled foundation does not meet design requirements. Some of the drainage ditches beside the runway, which were built last year, generally leak water and have been reworked this year.

The reason why this project cannot be constructed according to the planned schedule is mainly due to the leaders of the Third Mechanical Engineering Team of the Ministry of Water Resources Engineering Bureau, who are contracting this project, lacking a sense of responsibility for national construction and falling into a purely economistic small circle. Since the Third Team contracted this project last year, it has lost hundreds of thousands of yuan due to poor management. Therefore, this year, the leaders of the Third Team have shown a "project progress and quality are secondary, losing money is absolutely unacceptable" approach to construction leadership. Since June of this year, the Third Team and the Airport Construction Engineering Office of the Civil Aviation Administration of China have sent their main engineers and technicians to participate in the negotiation of the contracting contract. More than sixty meetings were held before and after, and detailed records of each meeting were signed by both parties to take effect. However, the contract has not been finalized until now. The relationship between the two parties is very tense, and sometimes they argue red-faced. The content of the disputes between the two parties mainly revolves around economic issues, such as how many cents of freight are needed to transport one cubic meter of soil. Party A is afraid of exceeding the national budget and is very strict. Party B is afraid of losing money, so they argue over every little bit, every cent. At the beginning of this year, Party B transferred a part of the construction force to do other projects because the contracting agreement had not been reached. Unexpectedly, this part of the force could not be withdrawn in time in April and May, so that many projects of the airport that should have been completed before the rainy season, such as drainage ditches and highway culverts, were not completed on time. In addition, the rainy season came earlier this year, the rain was heavy, and the supply of materials was also tight. The losses in the rainy season were great. A large concrete culvert several meters high on the access highway was washed away by floods. Before it was washed away, the inspector of the construction site found that the culvert was dangerous and reminded the section leaders and related engineers to find a way to build a flood control dike. But no one accepted this suggestion. As a result, the ruthless flood washed away the culvert, causing the country an unnecessary loss. The drainage ditches on both sides of the runway were not completely repaired before the rainy season, and the repaired parts generally leaked water, so the rainwater on and near the runway could not be drained. Party B could have taken temporary drainage measures, but they were afraid of spending money without any guarantee, saying, "Unless Party A agrees first, I will do it." They even allowed the rainwater to wash the runway, hollowing out the sand foundation under the runway. This not only affects the life of the runway, but also affects safety.

If the losses caused by quality accidents in the rainy season, the man-hour costs during the rainy season, the mechanical downtime costs, and the additional winter construction costs are added up, the amount is quite alarming. It is estimated that the actual cost of the airport project this year may exceed the national budget by 10% to 15%.

The person in charge of the construction unit contracting this project did not properly check and lead the construction of the shortcomings, but believed that the slow progress of the project was due to the early arrival of the rainy season and the heavy rain. They pushed the responsibility to objective reasons.

The Beijing Central Airport is the largest project above the quota in the civil aviation sector in my country's first five-year plan. Now, severe cold is approaching. If the construction unit does not seize the time to save the losses that have been caused, speed up construction, and carefully check the project quality, this year's construction plan will be even less guaranteed, and the country will suffer even greater losses.

### 施工单位只怕赔钱，不管国家利益  中央航空港工程进度迟缓、质量低劣、浪费严重

    施工单位只怕赔钱，不管国家利益
    中央航空港工程进度迟缓、质量低劣、浪费严重
    据新华社8日讯　新华社记者林印报道：在北京新建的中央航空港工程，到10月15日止只完成了原定年度计划工作量的40％左右。这个工程的施工进度太慢，许多重要工程如跑道、停机坪、排水沟、公路都没有按计划要求的日期修好，其中有些工程不得不拖迟在严冬施工，预计今冬因此增加的防寒费、夜班费等约三十二万元。有些不适于在冬季施工的工程，如停机坪的混凝土工程等，如果在11月15日以前不能做完，就要拖到明年去做。
    已经完工的一些工程，质量也相当差。譬如最主要的跑道工程，混凝土强度不够，有些地方露出裂纹，不合国家验收标准。跑道下面用沙铺成的基础，有部分已被雨水淘空，重新填起来的基础密实程度达不到设计要求。跑道两旁去年已经修好的一部分排水沟，普遍漏水，今年又返工重修。
    这个工程不能按照预定计划进行施工的原因，主要是承包这项工程的水利部工程总局第三机械工程总队的领导人员，缺乏对国家建设负责的精神，陷进了单纯的经济主义小圈子。三总队自从去年包下这项工程之后，因为经营管理不好，去年亏累了几十万元。因此今年三总队的领导人员在领导施工时，就表现了“工程进度和质量问题还在其次，赔钱万万不能”的做法。从今年6月起，三总队和中国民用航空局建港工程处都派了主要工程师和技术员参加签订包工合同的谈判。前后开了六十多次会议，每次详细记录都经双方签字才生效。但是直到现在，合同还没有订成。双方关系闹得很紧张，有时争得面红耳赤。双方争执的内容主要在经济问题上扯皮，如运一方土究竟需要几分钱的运费等。甲方怕超过国家预算，扣得很紧。乙方怕赔钱，就一点一滴，一分一厘地争。今年年初，乙方因为包工协议尚未达成，抽调了一部分施工力量去做其他工程。不料这部分力量在四、五月间不能及时撤回，以致航空港许多应该在雨季前完工的工程如排水沟、公路涵洞，都没有按时完成。加上今年雨季来得比较早，雨水又大，材料供应也紧张。雨季中的损失很大。进港公路上有个几公尺高的大混凝土涵洞，被洪水冲垮。冲垮之前，工地的检查员发现涵洞有危险，曾经提醒工段领导和有关工程师想办法修一道防洪围堰。但是都没有接受这个建议。结果眼看着无情的洪水把涵洞冲毁，使国家遭受了一次不应有的损失。跑道两旁的排水沟没有在雨季以前完全修好，已修好的部分又普遍漏水，所以跑道上和跑道附近的雨水排不出去。本来乙方可以采取临时排水措施，就因为怕花了钱没着落，说是“除非甲方先答应了，我才作。”竟听任雨水冲刷跑道，把跑道下面沙铺成的基础淘空。这样不仅影响跑道的寿命，而且影响安全。
    如果把雨季中造成质量事故的损失、雨季中窝工费用、机械停置费和追加的冬季施工费等加起来，数目相当惊人。预计今年航空港工程的实际费用，可能要超过国家预算的10％到15％。
    承包这项工程的施工单位的负责人，并没有很好地检查领导施工中的缺点，却认为工程进度慢是由于今年雨季来得早，雨水大。把责任推之于客观原因。
    北京中央航空港是我国第一个五年计划中民航事业方面最大的一个限额以上的工程。现在，严寒快来临了。如果施工单位再不抓紧时间，挽救已经造成的损失，加紧施工，认真检查工程质量，今年的施工计划更加没有保证，国家也将会遭受更大的损失。
