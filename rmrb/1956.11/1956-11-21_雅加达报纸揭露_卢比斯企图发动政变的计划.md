Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, November 20th: Jakarta newspapers revealed on the 19th that Colonel Lubis, the former Deputy Chief of Staff of the Indonesian Army, plotted to launch a coup on the 17th. The plan failed due to the lack of unity among Lubis's followers and the preventive measures taken by the Army Chief of Staff.

According to the "Indonesia Torch" newspaper, Lubis's plan was to take full control of Jakarta on the 17th and force President Sukarno to step down. To achieve this plan, about a company of soldiers was transferred to the suburbs of Jakarta on the 16th to stand by, and arrangements were made within the city. Because Army Chief of Staff Nasution learned of the intelligence in advance and took resolute steps, the coup did not materialize. This company was transferred back to its original garrison. According to the "East Star" newspaper, this fully armed unit belonged to the Assault Force Training Regiment of the Cimaher Training Center in West Java, led by Major Djalani.

According to the "Sunday News" on the 18th, Lubis's military coup plan had been attempted many times this year without success. According to his first plan, Foreign Minister Abdulgani should have been arrested on August 13, all cabinet ministers arrested on the 14th, and then the president forced to announce the establishment of a Military Commission Republic on the 17th. However, those implementing this plan hesitated and procrastinated. Instead of arresting Abdulgani at midnight as originally planned, the officers concerned did not go to Abdulgani's house until dawn, thus the plan failed. Lubis then held a secret meeting at the British Club in Jakarta from September 12 to 14, planning to launch a coup during President Sukarno's visit to China and the Soviet Union. However, the plan was known to the Army Chief of Staff in advance and also failed. Later, there was another conspiracy to launch a coup on October 10, and detailed plans were drawn up to occupy important departments of the capital, but it failed for the same reason.

Army Chief of Staff Nasution later organized a special committee, intending to take severe measures against the officers who participated in the riot plan. Seeing that the situation was not good, Lubis publicized the measures planned by the Army Chief of Staff and the names of the officers to be arrested through American journalists, so that it could not be realized.

In order to ease the tense situation within the army, at the meeting of military region commanders held on October 20, Nasution agreed to dissolve the special committee and entrust the task of improving the army's situation to the Chief of Staff's Adjutant Office. However, this measure still did not satisfy Lubis.

According to the "Independent" newspaper on the 19th, the Commander of the Sixth Military Region, Abimanyu, recently sent a telegram to the Army Chief of Staff, "strongly protesting" the severe measures taken against Lubis and others. However, his actions did not receive the support of his subordinates.

    雅加达报纸揭露
    卢比斯企图发动政变的计划
    新华社雅加达20日电　雅加达各报在19日揭露了印度尼西亚前陆军副参谋长卢比斯上校企图在17日发动政变的计划，这个计划由于卢比斯的党羽不齐心和陆军参谋长的预防措施而宣告失败。
    据“印度尼西亚火炬报”报道，卢比斯的计划是要在17日全部控制雅加达，并且逼迫苏加诺总统下野。为实现这一计划，有大约一连的兵力在16日被调到雅加达郊区待命，并且在城内作了布置。由于陆军参谋长纳苏蒂安事先获悉情报，采取了坚决的步骤，政变未能实现。这连人被调回原驻防地。据“东星报”报道，这连全副武装的部队是属于驻在西爪哇芝马墟训练中心的突击部队训练团，由贾拉尼少校率领。
    据“星期日新闻”18日报道，卢比斯的军事政变计划在今年已经尝试过许多次，都没有成功。按照他的第一个计划，应该在8月13日逮捕外交部长阿卜杜加尼，14日逮捕所有内阁部长，然后在17日强迫总统宣布成立军事委员会共和国。但执行这个计划的人迟疑不前，原定在半夜就逮捕阿卜杜加尼，事实上是在天亮以后有关的军官才到阿卜杜加尼的家里去，因此计划失败了。卢比斯又在9月12日到14日在雅加达英国俱乐部举行秘密会议，计划在苏加诺总统访问中苏期间发动政变。但是计划在事先为陆军参谋长获悉，也失败了。后来又阴谋在10月10日再发动政变，并且拟订了占领首都重要部门的详细计划，后因同样原因失败。
    陆军参谋长纳苏蒂安后来组织了特种委员会，打算对参加暴动计划的军官采取严厉措施。卢比斯见势不妙，于是就把陆军参谋长计划中的措施以及将要逮捕的军官姓名通过美国记者加以宣扬，使它不能实现。
    为了缓和陆军内部紧张局势，在10月20日举行的各军区司令会议上，纳苏蒂安曾经同意把特种委员会解散，而把改善陆军情况的任务交由参谋长侍从室去执行。但是这个措施仍然没有使卢比斯满意。
    据“独立报”19日报道，第六军区司令阿比曼约最近打电报给陆军参谋长。“严重抗议”对卢比斯等所采取的严厉措施。但是，他的这种行动没有获得他的部下的支持。
