    Communiqué of the Second Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China
    The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China held its Second Plenary Session from November 10 to 15, 1956.
    Eighty-four members of the Central Committee and sixty-five alternate members attended the meeting. One hundred and forty-seven responsible personnel from central and local authorities attended the meeting as observers.
    The agenda of the meeting was: (1) the current situation; (2) the control figures for the 1957 national economic development plan and financial budget; (3) the issues of grain and major non-staple foods (pork and cooking oil).
    Comrade Liu Shaoqi gave a report on the first issue. In his report, he talked about the Egyptian issue, the Polish issue, and the Hungarian issue, as well as the policies adopted by the Party on these issues and the lessons learned. Comrade Liu Shaoqi pointed out that in order to oppose imperialism's aggression against the Middle East and its subversive activities against the socialist camp, all countries in the socialist camp must resolutely strengthen their unity with the Soviet Union as the leader.
    Comrade Zhou Enlai gave a report on the second issue. The report explained the implementation of the 1956 economic plan and financial budget, pointed out the achievements, experiences, and lessons learned, and based on these, proposed the control figures for 1957. In view of the inappropriateness of certain items in this year's annual plan and the excessive use of certain expenses, next year's plan should make appropriate compressions in certain areas under the premise of continued progress, and a vigorous conservation campaign must be launched in state organs.
    Comrade Chen Yun gave a report on the third issue. The report put forward a series of measures to improve the procurement and sales of grain and to increase the production of pork and cooking oil.
    The meeting held heated discussions on these issues.
    The meeting fully agreed with the Central Political Bureau's analysis of the international situation and the various steps taken by the Central Political Bureau. The meeting unanimously supported the Egyptian people's struggle against the aggression of Britain, France, and Israel and the Hungarian people's struggle against reactionary forces, believing that the Soviet Union's assistance to the Hungarian people was just. It also believed that the strong unity of socialist forces and the strong unity of anti-imperialist forces would surely be able to overcome imperialism's conspiracy to create international tension. The meeting pointed out that the socialist transformation was basically completed in 1956, and the production of heavy industry, light industry, and agriculture had all increased, and basic construction had made tremendous achievements. The vast majority of investments in basic construction and expenditures on other undertakings were correct, but a small portion was incorrect. People's lives had improved in 1956, and employment had increased, which the people were satisfied with. However, the improvement of people's lives must be gradual, and excessive demands and things that cannot be done temporarily must be openly and repeatedly explained to the people. The meeting unanimously agreed that a campaign to increase production and practice economy should be launched throughout the Party and among the people of the whole country. Increased production must be carried out under the conditions that raw materials are guaranteed and there is social need. At the same time, both increased production and economy must ensure the quality of work and pay attention to safety. Comrade Mao Zedong made a summary speech on the last day of the meeting. He expressed his complete agreement with the various policies and measures adopted by the plenary session. Comrade Mao Zedong called on all state workers, economic workers, and especially responsible personnel in all fields, to promote the style of hard work and plain living, to share weal and woe with the masses, to oppose extravagance and waste, and to adopt the method of rectification to fight against the tendencies of subjectivism, sectarianism, and bureaucracy. He demanded that the whole Party resolutely oppose Han chauvinism on the issue of ethnic minorities and resolutely oppose great-power chauvinism in international exchanges. He emphasized that as long as we adhere to the Marxist-Leninist principle of closely relying on the masses of the people and oppose all forms of work style that are divorced from the masses, we, together with the Soviet Union, the people's democracies, and the socialist forces of the world, will surely be able to overcome the difficulties on the road ahead and achieve even greater victories.

    中共中央第二次全体会议公报
    一九五六年十一月十日到十五日，中国共产党中央委员会举行了第二次全体会议。
    出席这次会议的有中央委员会委员八十四人，候补委员六十五人。中央和地方的其他负责工作人员一百四十七人列席了这次会议。
    会议的议程是：（一）目前时局；（二）一九五七年度国民经济发展计划和财政预算的控制数字；（三）粮食和主要副食品（猪肉和食油）问题。
    刘少奇同志就第一个问题作了报告。他在报告中谈到了埃及问题、波兰问题和匈牙利问题，谈到了党对这些问题所采取的政策和应得的教训。刘少奇同志指出，为了反对帝国主义对于中东的侵略和对于社会主义阵营的颠复活动，社会主义阵营各国必须坚决地加强以苏联为首的团结。
    周恩来同志就第二个问题作了报告。报告说明了一九五六年度经济计划和财政预算执行的情况，指出了成绩、经验和教训，并且根据这些，提出了一九五七年度的控制数字。鉴于今年的年度计划中有某些项目不恰当，某些费用用得多了，明年的计划应当在继续前进的前提下在某些方面作适当的压缩，并且必须在国家机关中大力开展节约运动。
    陈云同志就第三个问题作了报告。报告对于改善粮食的收购工作和销售工作，对于增加猪肉和食油的生产，提出了一系列的措施。
    会议对于这些问题进行了热烈的讨论。
    会议完全同意中央政治局对于国际局势的分析和中央政治局所采取的各种步骤。会议一致支持埃及人民反抗英、法、以色列侵略的斗争和匈牙利人民反对反动势力的斗争，认为苏联对于匈牙利人民的援助是正义的，并且相信社会主义力量的强大团结和反帝国主义力量的强大团结，必然能够战胜帝国主义制造国际紧张局势的阴谋。会议指出：1956年社会主义改造基本完成，重工业、轻工业和农业的生产都有增长，基本建设有巨大的成绩。基本建设投资和其他事业开支绝大部分是正确的，但是有一小部分不正确。一九五六年的人民生活有改善，就业有增加，人民对于这些是满意的。但是人民生活的改善必须是渐进的，过高的要求和暂时办不到的事情，要向人民公开地反复地解释清楚。会议一致认为：应当在全党和全国人民中发动一个增产节约运动。增产必须在原料有保证和社会需要的条件下进行，同时无论增产和节约，都必须保证工作质量和注重安全。毛泽东同志在会议的最后一天作了总结性的发言。他表示完全同意全会所采取的各项方针和措施。毛泽东同志号召全体国家工作人员、经济工作人员首先是各方面的负责工作人员，提倡艰苦朴素的作风，与群众同甘共苦，反对铺张浪费现象，并且采取整风方法，同主观主义、宗派主义、官僚主义的倾向作斗争。他要求全党在对待少数民族问题上坚决反对大汉族主义，在国际交往中坚决反对大国主义。他着重指出：只要坚持马克思列宁主义的密切依靠人民群众的原则，反对一切形式的脱离群众的作风，我们和苏联、各人民民主国家以及全世界的社会主义力量，就一定能够克服前进道路上的困难，而取得更伟大的胜利。
