Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 16th. Shanghai's commercial departments have begun to train a large number of young commercial workers.

    The Shanghai First Bureau of Commerce, through the Labor Bureau, recruited two thousand young people with junior high school education or above for state-owned stores. Starting this week, they have been reporting to twenty-two companies, including department stores, pharmaceuticals, and food. They will be assigned to various business departments to participate in practical work, while simultaneously undergoing systematic business studies. It is expected that after one year, they will be trained to become relatively skilled salespersons, warehouse keepers, accountants, statisticians, and other commercial technicians and managers. The Transportation Electrical Equipment Company has decided to train six hundred electrician apprentices and sixty radio repair apprentices in the public-private joint venture hydro-electric engineering firms and radio shops, where manpower is extremely insufficient. In late October and early November, the first batch of electrician apprentices has been assigned to hydro-electric engineering firms in Zhabei District for internships. They are led by experienced master craftsmen, implementing a system of guaranteed teaching and learning. After one year, they will be trained to become Grade C electricians.

    Service industries such as hairdressing, laundry and dyeing, photography, and catering, which rarely recruited apprentices after liberation, are now also cultivating new commercial service talents. The first batch of one hundred and forty young hairdressers trained in the hairdressing industry have already graduated; the second batch of three hundred and fifty is currently undergoing training. The Shanghai Welfare Undertakings Company has also specially established a hair salon with first-class equipment, allowing young trainees to operate and inviting senior hairdressers to provide guidance. The laundry and dyeing industry has decided to train two hundred and twenty ironing workers, washing workers, dyeing workers, and mending workers in laundry and dyeing shops throughout the city. Many famous chefs in Chinese and Western restaurants have also trained more than ninety chefs who can operate independently, and there are still more than two hundred apprentices in training.
