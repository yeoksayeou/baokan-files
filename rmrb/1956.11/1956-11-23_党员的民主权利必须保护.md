    The Democratic Rights of Party Members Must Be Protected
    Song Cheng
    The realization of all the Party's propositions depends on the efforts of all Party members and organizations at all levels. Therefore, the Party has always advocated giving Party members full democratic rights to stimulate the political enthusiasm and sense of responsibility of all Party members, so that they can participate more broadly and actively in and supervise the work of the Party. The new Party Constitution expands the democratic rights of Party members precisely in accordance with this spirit.
    For a Communist Party member, the highest degree of democracy is to allow them to express their views on the Party's policies, Party work, and various issues related to themselves. The new Party Constitution maximizes the democratic demands of Party members in this regard. According to the provisions of the new Party Constitution, Party members have the right to participate in free and practical discussions on the theory and practice of Party policies at Party meetings or in Party newspapers and periodicals; to make suggestions on Party work and to exert creativity in their work; to criticize any Party organization and any staff member at Party meetings; if they have different opinions on Party resolutions, in addition to unconditionally implementing them, they may reserve and submit their own opinions to the Party's leading organs; when the Party organization makes a decision to punish or evaluate themselves, Party members request to participate in person, and Party members are allowed to make statements, appeals, and accusations to any level of Party organization. This means that the Party not only does not use discipline to restrict any Party member from expressing their views or force Party members to abandon their views, but also uses Party discipline to ensure that Party members have the right to state and reserve their opinions.
    The Party's granting of full rights to Party members to express their opinions and fully exert their creativity in their work will surely inspire the Party masses to have a high degree of independent responsibility and creative spirit for the Party's cause, enabling them to concentrate the wisdom of the masses and boldly create new methods and new experiences suitable for the specific circumstances of the time and place when carrying out the Party's tasks, and creatively solve problems in their work. Moreover, it can force those leaders who are accustomed to sticking to conventions, who only want mechanical obedience from below, and who do not value the opinions and creativity of Party members, to change their style under the constraints of Party discipline.
    If Party members have ample opportunity to express their views, the Party can regularly hear the various opinions and demands of the vast number of Party members and the people they are connected with, so that the Party can have more sufficient and reliable basis when considering and deciding on issues, and that all aspects of the Party's work can be supervised and criticized by everyone, and deviations and errors in the work can be prevented in time. This is the most basic condition necessary to ensure the correctness of the Party's leadership.
    Even before the new Party Constitution was adopted, most Party organizations respected and protected the democratic rights of Party members. It has become customary in many Party organizations to solicit the opinions of relevant Party members before making decisions, and to organize Party members to discuss Party policies. Criticism and self-criticism have been carried out in many Party organizations, and attention has been paid to protecting criticism from below, and resolutely fighting against various phenomena that do not support criticism or suppress criticism. For individuals who retaliate against critics, no matter how great their merits or how high their positions, the Party organization seriously enforces Party discipline. Most Party organizations in industrial and mining enterprises have generally held regular general meetings of Party members in the past one or two years to submit major issues in Party work and enterprise production to all Party members for discussion. This is an important example of grassroots organizations promoting democracy and Party members exercising their democratic rights.
    However, it should also be seen that there are still many Party organizations that have not fully promoted democracy and often do not respect or even infringe upon the rights of Party members. The right of Party members to criticize the work of leaders or leading staff is often not respected or even infringed upon. Some Party organizations or leaders like to stipulate many unnecessary rules and regulations, so that criticism from below is subjected to various unreasonable restrictions, so that many comrades with opinions cannot speak freely. Some leaders also use bad methods such as "putting hats" and "wearing small shoes" to give critics disguised retaliation. When comrades below them raise opinions to them, they do not first humbly consider other people's opinions, but pick on the shortcomings of the critics, and even use big hats such as "arrogant and conceited" and "disrespectful to leadership" to suppress people without any basis; or deliberately create problems for these comrades in their work, and seize people's "pigtails", and as long as they seize a little shortcoming of others (which is of course very easy), they take the opportunity to exaggerate and render it to vent their dissatisfaction. This is the biggest obstacle to carrying out criticism from below in some departments at present. Protecting criticism, especially criticism from below, should be regarded as an important issue in protecting the rights of Party members. It should be affirmed that as long as the critic puts forward his opinion in accordance with the procedures stipulated by the organization, regardless of whether his opinion is correct or not, his spirit of daring to raise criticism to the leader should be welcomed and protected. It is difficult for anyone's criticism of others to be completely correct, and the criticized can only accept the correct part of it. Some comrades' views may be biased and one-sided, and the facts they say may have some discrepancies. The task of the Party organization is to support and accept the correct part of it, and to explain the opinions and criticisms that are not in accordance with the facts and are incomplete, and allow the criticized to defend and counter-criticize.
    The right of Party members to state their opinions on the Party's policies and Party work to the Party organization is also often not protected and respected in many Party organizations. Some Party organizations do not pay attention to giving Party members the opportunity to express their opinions, and even at Party meetings or work meetings, they often do not pay attention to listening to the opinions of Party members. What is especially bad is that some Party leading organs and leaders are unwilling to listen to opinions that are different from their own, and comrades who raise different opinions are often unreasonably and rudely reprimanded, so that some comrades only dare to echo and dare not speak opinions that are different from those above, and even dare not put forward some measures that are suitable for local conditions in completing tasks. This greatly weakens the political enthusiasm and creativity of the Party masses. For example, when formulating agricultural production increase plans this spring, Party organizations in various places concentrated their efforts on opposing right-leaning conservative ideas, which was completely correct and completely necessary. However, some Party organizations therefore gave rough reprimands to some Party members who raised different opinions on the production increase targets, and even threatened them with Party discipline to abandon their own opinions. This practice is wrong. Most of the opinions of these comrades may be biased towards conservatism. The Party organization must also criticize conservative opinions. However, when everyone is opposing conservatism, listening to the opinions on the opposing side, so that the leaders can be calmer when a "gust of wind" blows, can only be good and not bad. At the same time, the Party organization should adopt a clear attitude of protection for this enthusiasm of Party members to make suggestions, that is to say, the Party organization can only say that their opinions are wrong, but cannot say that they should not make suggestions; if they insist on their own opinions, the Party organization should also allow them to reserve or appeal their opinions to the leading organs under the condition of implementing the resolutions. At the same time, some of these opinions are indeed correct, and the leading organs' simple and rude attitude towards them makes it impossible to correct their own mistakes in time.
    Some Party organizations often do not implement Party discipline on Party members in accordance with the principles and procedures stipulated in the Party Constitution, and do not consider the opinions of the person concerned when punishing Party members, do not allow the person concerned to attend the meeting, do not allow the punished comrades to appeal and defend, and even unreasonably impose heavier punishments on comrades who file appeals. The consequences of this practice are very bad, it will seriously hurt the enthusiasm of Party members, affect the unity of the Party, and weaken the democratic life of the Party.
    Some Party organizations or Party leaders infringe upon the democratic rights of Party members because they are arrogant and complacent, and self-righteous. Therefore, they can only listen to the same opinions as themselves, and are unwilling to listen to different opinions; they only allow others to flatter and praise them, and do not allow others to expose their shortcomings and errors. In their view, they are the embodiment of the Party, and whoever "offends" them is "anti-Party". Therefore, they rarely consider the issue of respecting and protecting the rights of Party members, and even rudely infringe upon the rights of Party members. For such people, the Party organization should give the deserved disciplinary punishment in accordance with the provisions of the new Party Constitution. Some Party organizations or staff members do not respect the democratic rights of Party members, mainly because they are not good enough and lack experience in doing Party work. They neither truly understand the great significance of protecting the democratic rights of Party members, nor can they distinguish in actual life which activities of Party members should be subject to the constraints of Party discipline and which should be protected. Sometimes they unconsciously infringe upon the rights of Party members. These comrades should be helped and educated so that they understand that protecting the rights of Party members and helping Party members exercise their rights is one of the basic tasks of the Party organization.
    The Party organization should also educate and guide Party members to correctly exercise their rights. Whether it is to make suggestions on the Party's policies and Party work, or to carry out criticism, they should strictly abide by the Party's relevant organizational principles and disciplinary regulations. For example, what needs to be said at the Party meeting should not be said in other inappropriate occasions; what can only be said within the Party should not be said casually outside the Party; when raising different opinions on the Party's resolutions, they should be raised in accordance with the procedures stipulated by the Party, and it is not allowed to publicize personal opinions that conflict with the spirit of the Party's resolutions everywhere; when the personal opinions are rejected by the leadership or the majority of comrades, although they can still reserve their personal opinions, they must obey the decisions of the leadership or the majority to ensure the consistency of the Party's actions; criticizing the Party's organizations and staff members can only be done with a comradely attitude of treating the illness to save the patient, and it is not allowed to treat the organizations and comrades with the attitude of treating the enemy.... If it is believed that since the democratic rights of Party members are to be expanded, Party members can freely adopt the methods and means they like to carry out internal Party struggles; if it is believed that to expand democracy, Party members can not do practical investigation and research work, can casually act on emotions, casually complain, or force the Party organization to accept their own incorrect opinions, and force the Party's newspapers and periodicals to publish their own incorrect opinions, this is also a misunderstanding of expanding democratic rights; if they act freely according to their own opinions and not according to the Party's principles, and even treat the organization and comrades with the means of treating the enemy, this is of course not beneficial and very harmful to the Party's cause and to the development of the enthusiasm of Party members. This can only cause bad consequences of extreme democracy, lax organization and discipline, and undermining the unity and solidarity of the Party within the Party. It should also be recognized that most of the shortcomings and errors in our Party are caused by lack of experience and shortcomings in ideological style. Therefore, in general, the method of carrying out criticism to solve ideological problems and summarizing work experience should be used to overcome shortcomings and correct errors, and other simple and rude methods should not be adopted. The Party organization should patiently educate Party members to correctly understand these issues. Especially for younger new Party members, the Party organization should carry out more education to teach them to correctly exercise their democratic rights, because these comrades have a high degree of enthusiasm and a strong sense of responsibility, and they want to fight against unreasonable phenomena, but they lack Party knowledge and experience in internal Party struggle. When criticizing or stating their opinions to the Party, they may unconsciously violate the Party's principles. At the same time, the Party organization should also pay attention to the fact that there are a very few Party members who are of bad quality or have personal ambitions. For the sake of ulterior base personal purposes, they will abuse the rights of Party members, use the pretext of promoting democracy to carry out various non-organizational activities, and even do not hesitate to undermine the unity and prestige of the Party. For such people, the Party organization should resolutely struggle with them, strictly enforce Party discipline, and must not have any indulgence.

    党员的民主权利必须保护
    宋琤
    党的一切主张的实现要依靠全体党员和各级组织的努力。因此，党从来都主张给党员以充分的民主权利，以激发全体党员的政治积极性和责任心，使他们更广泛更积极地参与并且监督党的工作。新党章正是根据这种精神扩大了党员的民主权利。
    对于共产党员来说，最高度的民主，莫过于允许他们对党的政策、党的工作以及有关本身的各种问题发表自己的看法。新党章正是在这方面最大限度地满足了党员的民主要求。根据新党章的规定，党员有权利在党的会议或者在党的报刊上参加关于党的政策的理论和实际问题的自由的切实的讨论；对党的工作提出建议，在工作中发挥创造性；在党的会议上批评党的任何组织和任何工作人员；对于党的决议，如果有不同的意见，除无条件地执行外，可以保留和向党的领导机关提出自己的意见；在党组织对自己作出处分或者鉴定性的决议的时候，党员要求亲自参加，而且允许党员向党的任何一级组织提出声明、申诉和控告。这就是说，党不但不用纪律去限制任何一个党员发表自己的意见，或者强制党员放弃自己的意见，而且用党的纪律来保证党员有陈述和保留自己意见的权利。
    党给予党员充分发表意见和在工作中充分发挥创造性的权利，必将鼓舞起党员群众对党的事业的高度的独立负责和创造精神，使他们在执行党的任务时能够集中群众的智慧，大胆地创造出适合于当时当地具体情况的新方法新经验，创造性地解决工作中的问题。而且可以使那些惯于墨守陈规，只要下边机械服从，不重视党员群众的意见和创造性的领导人员，在党的纪律的约束下，不得不改变自己的作风。
    党员有了充分发表意见的机会，就可以使党经常听到广大党员群众以及他们所联系的人民群众的各种意见和要求，使党在考虑和决定问题的时候，能有更充分的可靠的依据，使党的各方面的工作受到大家的监督和批评，及时防止工作中的偏差和错误。这是保证党的领导正确所必不可少的最基本的条件。
    就在新党章通过以前，大多数的党组织对于党员的民主权利都是尊重和保护的。决定问题以前征求有关的党员的意见，组织党员讨论党的政策，在很多党组织中已经成为习惯。在很多党组织内开展了批评和自我批评并且注意保护自下而上的批评，和各种不支持批评、压制批评的现象进行坚决的斗争，对于个别对批评者施行打击报复的人，不管他们的功劳多大职位多高，党组织都严肃地执行党的纪律。大多数工矿企业的党组织，在最近一、二年来都普遍地定期召开党员大会，把党的工作和企业生产中的重大问题提交全体党员讨论。这是基层组织发扬民主，党员行使民主权利的一个重要典型。
    但是，也应该看到，还有不少党组织没有充分发扬民主，常常不尊重甚至侵害党员的权利。经常不被尊重甚至受到侵犯的是党员批评领导工作或领导工作人员的权利。有一些党组织或者领导人员喜欢规定许多不必要的清规戒律，使自下而上的批评受到各种各样无理的限制，以致许多有意见的同志不能畅所欲言。有一些领导者还用“戴帽子”、“穿小鞋”等恶劣手段给批评者以变相的打击报复。当下边的同志对他们提出意见的时候，他们不是首先虚心地考虑别人的意见，而是去挑剔批评者的缺点，甚至无根据地用“高傲自大”、“不尊重领导”等大帽子去压人；或者是在工作中故意给这些同志出难题，抓人的“小辫子”，只要抓住别人一点缺点（这当然是很容易的），就乘机夸大渲染，以发泄自己的不满。这是在若干部门目前开展自下而上的批评的最大的障碍。应该把保护批评，特别是自上而下的批评，当做保护党员权利的一个重要问题。应该肯定，只要批评者是按照组织规定的手续提出意见的，不论他的意见是否正确，对他们这种敢于向领导提出批评的精神都应该表示欢迎，而且给予保护。任何人对别人的批评都很难是完全正确的，被批评者当然也只能接受其中正确的部分。有些同志的看法可能偏激、片面，所说的事实也可能有某些出入，党组织的任务就在于支持和接受其中正确的部分，对不合乎事实和不全面的意见和批评，应该进行解释，并且允许被批评者进行申辩和反批评。
    党员向党组织陈述自己对党的政策、党的工作的意见的权利，在不少党组织中也常常得不到保护和尊重。有些党组织不注意给党员以发表意见的机会，就是在党的会议或工作会议上，也常常不注意听取党员群众的意见。尤其不好的是，一些党的领导机关和领导人员不愿意听和自己看法不同的意见，提出不同意见的同志常常受到无理的粗暴的斥责，以至使有些同志只敢随声附和，不敢讲和上面不同的意见，甚至因此连完成任务中的一些因地制宜的作法也不敢提出。这就大大削弱了党员群众的政治积极性和创造性。比如，今年春天制定农业增产计划的时候，各地党组织都集中力量反对右倾保守思想，这是完全正确完全必要的。但是，有些党组织因此就对一部分对增产指标提出不同意见的党员给予粗暴的斥责，甚至用党的纪律去威胁他们放弃自己的意见。这种作法就是不对的了。这些同志的意见可能大都是偏于保守的。党组织对保守的意见也必须进行批判。但是，在大家都在反对保守的时候，听一听反对方面的意见，使领导者在“一阵风”吹来的时候冷静一点，只有好处没有坏处。同时党组织对于党员提意见的这种积极性则应当采取明确的保护态度，也就是说，党组织只能说他们的意见是不对的，而不能说他们不应该提意见；如果他们坚持自己的意见，党组织还应当允许他们在执行决议的条件下保留或向领导机关申诉自己的意见。同时，这些意见中，也有一些的确是正确的，领导机关用简单粗暴的态度去对待他们，就使自己的错误不能及时纠正。
    有些党组织常常不按党章所规定的原则和手续对党员执行党的纪律，处分党员时不考虑本人的意见，不允许本人参加会议，不允许受处分的同志申诉辩解，甚至毫无道理的对提出申诉的同志加重处分。这种作法的后果是非常不好的，它将严重地伤害党员的积极性、影响党的团结，削弱党的民主生活。
    有些党组织或党的领导人员侵犯党员的民主权利，是因为他们骄傲自满，自以为是，因此，只能听和自己一样的意见，不愿听不同的意见；只许别人对他们奉承赞扬，不许别人揭发他们的缺点和错误。在他们看来，他们就是党的化身，谁“触犯”了他，就是“反党”。因此，他们也就很少考虑到尊重和保护党员权利的问题，甚至粗暴地侵害党员的权利。对于这样的人，党组织应该根据新党章的规定，给予应得的纪律处分。有些党组织或工作人员不尊重党员的民主权利，主要地是水平不高，缺少做党的工作的经验。他们既不真正懂得保护党员民主权利的重大意义，在实际生活中也分不清楚党员的那些活动是应该受到党的纪律的约束的，那些是应该受到保护的，有时他们就不自觉地侵害了党员的权利。对于这些同志应该进行帮助教育，使他们懂得，保护党员的权利，帮助党员行使权利，是党组织的基本任务之一。
    党组织还要教育和指导党员正确地行使自己的权利。不论是对党的政策和党的工作提意见，或是开展批评，都应该严格地遵守党的有关的组织原则和纪律规定。比如，需要在党的会议上讲的，就不应该在其他不适当的场合讲；只可以在党内讲的，就不应该在党外随便乱讲；对党的决议提出不同意见的时候，应当按照党规定的手续提出来，不允许到处宣扬和党的决议精神相抵触的个人见解；当个人的意见被领导方面或多数同志否定后，虽然还可以保留个人的意见，但是，必须服从领导或多数人的决定，以保证党的行动的一致；对党的组织和工作人员提出批评，只能用同志式的治病救人的态度，而不允许用对敌人的态度对待组织和同志……。如果认为既然要扩大党员的民主权利，党员就可以随便采取自己所喜欢的方式和手段去进行党内斗争；如果认为要扩大民主，党员就可以不做切实的调查研究工作，就可以随便凭感情办事，随便乱发牢骚，或者强要党组织接受自己不正确的意见，强要党的报刊登载自己不正确的意见，这也是对扩大民主权利的误解；如果不按照党的原则而按照自己的意见自由行动，甚至用对待敌人的手段来对待组织和同志，这对党的事业对发挥党员的积极性当然是没有好处而且是十分有害处的。这只能在党内引起极端民主、组织纪律涣散、破坏党的统一团结的不良后果。还应该认识到，我们党内的缺点和错误，大多是由于缺少经验和思想作风上的缺点所造成的。因此，在一般情况下就应当用开展批评解决思想问题和总结工作经验的办法来克服缺点纠正错误，而不应该采取其他简单粗暴的办法。党组织要耐心地教育党员正确地认识这些问题。特别是对年纪较轻的新党员，党组织应该进行更多的教育，教导他们正确地运用自己的民主权利，因为，这些同志热情很高责任心很强，看到不合理的现象就要进行斗争，可是，他们缺少党的知识和党内斗争的经验，在开展批评或向党陈述自己的意见的时候，有时会不自觉地违反党的原则。同时，党组织也还应该注意到，有极少数品质恶劣或有个人野心的党员，为了不可告人的卑鄙的个人目的，他们会滥用党员的权利，假借发扬民主，进行各种非组织活动，甚至不惜破坏党的团结和威信。对于这样的人，党组织应该坚决地同他们进行斗争，严肃地执行党的纪律，决不能有任何姑息迁就。
