Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, November 25th: Leading cadres of the Wuhan Municipal Commercial Department have improved commodity supply and business management by going deep to understand the needs of the masses and delving into basic-level units to study existing problems in their work.

Not long ago, the responsible cadres of the Financial and Trade Department of the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Finance, Grain and Trade Office of the Municipal People's Committee, and the First and Second Commercial Bureaus led relevant responsible personnel from state-owned specialized companies and basic-level stores to hold a meeting at the Huazhong Institute of Technology in the suburban cultural district to inspect the supply work in the cultural district. Many universities and colleges invited to participate in the meeting believed that the supply work in the cultural district had recently improved and expressed their gratitude to the commercial departments.

Originally, the commercial departments had done a poor job in supplying the cultural district, and teachers, staff, students, and people's representatives had raised many opinions. More than a month ago, Wang Jian, Deputy Director of the Finance, Grain and Trade Office of the Municipal People's Committee, inspected the supply work in the cultural district and found that the problems were indeed very serious. For example, the daily necessities such as vegetables and bean products were in short supply in the area, the variety was small, and the supply in other aspects was even worse, which brought great inconvenience to the lives of more than 50,000 professors, students, staff, and their families there. In order to quickly improve the supply work in the cultural district, Wang Jian also led the Deputy Directors of the First and Second Commercial Bureaus, and the managers and deputy managers of more than ten state-owned specialized companies such as department stores, cultural and sporting goods, food, and vegetables, to the cultural district to understand the opinions and requirements of various schools. The personnel of various schools raised many sharp criticisms. After conducting in-depth investigations on the spot, many responsible cadres who used to sit in offices reading documents and listening to reports changed their past view that "the opinions reflected by the masses may be exaggerated, and the problems may not be that serious." Afterwards, the commercial departments immediately formulated a work plan, sent out working groups, and improved the supply work in the cultural district.

After the Wuhan people made a fundamental reform in the vegetable supply work, they were satisfied that they could choose vegetables when buying vegetables and eat fresh and tender vegetables. Many large and medium-sized cities sent people and wrote letters to Wuhan to learn from their experience. Before and after the reform of the vegetable supply and marketing work, Li Ming, Deputy Director of the Municipal People's Committee's Agriculture, Forestry and Water Office, Yu Zhenhua, Director of the Second Commercial Bureau, and Fan Xiaobao, Deputy Director, had all gone deep into suburban vegetable production cooperatives and vegetable markets to understand the problems and study solutions. They found that due to the small variety of vegetables, low quality, and the prohibition of selection, they put forward practical improvement methods in production, supply, production and marketing combination, and prices.

After many private shops implemented overall public-private joint ventures, the shop directors and accountants often spent a lot of time dealing with meetings and filling out various reports. Salesmen also had to fill out counting sheets and inventory cards for each sale, which restricted the development of business. At the same time, problems such as increased administrative expenses and slower capital turnover appeared. In order to improve the leadership methods for public-private joint venture shops and help public-private joint venture shops improve their business management, the responsible cadres of the Finance, Grain and Trade Office of the Municipal People's Committee and the First Commercial Bureau also went deep into public-private joint venture shops to talk with directors, accountants, and salesmen, understand the causes of these problems, and rely on them to find solutions together. After initially eliminating many unnecessary reports and cards and improving business management, new atmospheres appeared in the shops, such as improved service quality and guaranteed rest for staff.

In the past month or so, in order to study how to open up free markets in a planned and led manner, some responsible cadres from the Financial and Trade Department of the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Finance, Grain and Trade Office of the Municipal People's Committee, and the Commercial Bureau have all gone deep into trading markets, agency houses, small commodity wholesale markets, and suburban agricultural production cooperatives to understand the situation and study the problems. Based on the actual situation, the relevant units have repeatedly discussed and revised the work plan for opening up free markets.

    改进商品供应工作的一条重要经验
    领导干部深入群众和深入基层单位
    武汉市迅速改进了市郊文化区的物资供应和全市的蔬菜供应工作；帮助公私合营商店改善经营管理；现在正在调查研究关于开放自由市场的问题。
    新华社武汉25日电　武汉市商业部门领导干部深入了解群众需要，深入基层单位研究工作中存在的问题，改进了商品的供应和经营管理工作。
    不久前，中共武汉市委财贸部、市人民委员会财粮贸办公室、第一、二商业局的负责干部率领有关国营专业公司和基层商店有关负责人员，在市郊文化区的华中工学院内召开了一个检查文化区供应工作的会议，被邀请参加会议的很多大、专学校都认为最近文化区供应工作已有改进，并且向商业部门表示感谢。
    原来，商业部门对文化区供应工作做的很差，教职员工、学生、人民代表都提过很多意见。一个多月以前，市人民委员会财粮贸办公室副主任王健到文化区检查了供应工作，发现问题确实很严重。如这个地区日常必需的蔬菜、豆制品都供应不足，品种也少，其他方面供应的更差，给那里五万多教授、学生、职工以及家属的生活带来很大不便。为了迅速改进文化区的供应工作，王健又带领第一、二商业局副局长，百货、文化用品、食品、蔬菜等十多个国营专业公司的经理、副经理，到文化区了解各学校的意见和要求。各学校的人员提出很多尖锐的批评。在实地深入了解以后，许多过去坐办公室看文件、听汇报的负责干部，改变了他们过去认为“群众反映意见可能言过其实，问题并不会那样严重”的看法。事后，商业部门立即制定出工作方案，派出工作组，改进文化区的供应工作。
    武汉市人民对蔬菜供应工作进行根本性改革以后，买菜时能挑选、能吃到鲜嫩蔬菜，感到满意，很多大、中城市派人和写信到武汉市来学习经验。在改革蔬菜供销工作的前前后后，市人民委员会农林水办公室副主任李明，第二商业局局长虞振华、副局长范晓宝等都曾分别深入郊区蔬菜生产合作社和菜市场了解问题，研究解决办法。他们发现了由于蔬菜品种少、质量低、又不准挑选等问题，因此在生产上、供应上、产销结合上和价格上提出了切合实际的改进办法。
    许多私营商店在实行全行业公私合营以后，商店的主任、会计经常花费很多时间应付会议、填写各种各样的报表，营业员每售一笔货也要填写计数单、存量卡等等，使营业开展受到限制，同时出现了行政开支增加、资金周转变慢等问题。为了改进对公私合营商店的领导方法，帮助公私合营商店改善经营管理，市人民委员会财粮贸办公室和第一商业局的负责干部也曾深入到公私合营商店去和主任、会计、营业员交谈，了解这些问题产生的原因，并且依靠他们共同想办法解决问题。经过初步取消了很多不必要的报表、卡片和改善经营管理后，商店即出现了服务质量提高、工作人员的休息能得到保证等新的气象。
    近一个多月来，为了研究如何有计划、有领导地开放自由市场问题，中共武汉市委财贸部、市人民委员会财粮贸办公室以及商业局的部分负责干部都深入到交易市场、代理行、小百货批发市场、郊区农业生产合作社等处了解情况、研究问题。根据实际情况，有关单位反复讨论和修改了开放自由市场的工作方案。
