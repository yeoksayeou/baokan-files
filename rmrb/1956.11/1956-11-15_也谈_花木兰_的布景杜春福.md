    Also Discussing the Sets of "Hua Mulan"
    Du Chunfu
    In Comrade Yu Wu’s article “Contradictions in the Movie ‘Hua Mulan’” (see page 8 of the “People’s Daily” on October 7th), he pointed out the contradiction between the realistic sets and the symbolic artistic expression techniques in the movie “Hua Mulan,” believing that the mutual conflict between the two “destroyed the complete beauty of art.” I disagree with this view.
    I think the realistic sets in the film not only did not destroy the complete beauty of art, but on the contrary, strengthened the dramatic effect of the performance. Take the scene in the film where Mulan asks to go home to take care of her parents, and is allowed by the Marshal. After twelve years of disguised military life, Mulan, who is about to return to her original identity as a daughter, imagines the unrestrained life after returning home, and is happy to the point of forgetting herself. At this moment, she unintentionally touches the curtain of the tent, and then she returns from the realm of fantasy to reality, realizing that she is still in the military camp, and forcibly suppresses her happy emotions. Here, precisely because there is a set of the tent, it sets off the environment in which the character is located and enriches the content of the character's performance.
    It is undeniable that opera art has its traditional forms of expression and unique style, and does not focus on sets. The reason for this is probably largely related to the poor conditions of past theaters and the underdevelopment of science and technology. But today, we already have very good theater conditions, stage art design is also quite complete, and some opera genres have made good use of this. Under such circumstances, why shouldn't we have sets when filming opera movies (film art is more unrestrained and can express broader life scenes)? If opera movies are all set with tables and chairs, the audience will probably not be satisfied!

    也谈“花木兰”的布景
    杜春福
    余吾家同志在“电影‘花木兰’里的矛盾”（见10月7日“人民日报”第八版）这篇文章中，指出了电影“花木兰”中真实的布景和象征的艺术表现手法的矛盾，认为由于二者的相互抵触，把“艺术的完整美破坏了”。对于这种看法，我是不同意的。
    我觉得影片的真实的布景，不但没有破坏艺术的完整美，相反的还加强了演出的戏剧效果。就以影片中木兰要求回家奉养父母，得到元帅允许以后这一节戏来看吧，经过十二年乔装征战生活，很快就要回复原来的女儿面目的木兰，遥想返里以后的无拘无束的生活，快活得到了忘情的地步。就在此时，她无意中触摸到了帐篷的帷幕，于是她从幻想的境地回到现实之中，意识到现在仍在军营里，而强自按捺下了自己快乐的情绪。在这里，正因为有了帐篷的布景，才衬托出了人物所处的环境，丰富了人物表演的内容。
    不可否认，戏曲艺术是有其传统的表现形式和独特的风格，是不着重布景的。究其原因，恐怕和过去剧场条件太坏，科学技术不发达等有很大的关系。但是今天，我们已经有了很好的剧场条件，舞台美术设计也相当完整，并且有些剧种已经对此很好地加以利用了。在这种情况之下，我们拍摄戏曲电影，有什么理由不要布景呢（电影艺术是更不受拘束，更可以表现广阔的生活场景的）？如果戏曲电影都是以桌子和椅子来布景，观众恐怕不会感到满足吧！
