Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 3rd: 100,000 people in Shanghai gathered at the People's Square in the city center this afternoon to oppose the armed aggression of British and French imperialism against Egypt. This conference was jointly initiated by the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and seventeen people's organizations including the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.

Workers, peasants, scientists, professors, students, literary and art workers, journalists, industrialists, businessmen, and Muslims delivered impassioned speeches on the rostrum, and their speeches were constantly interrupted by the shouts of the masses.

In the evening, 100,000 people who participated in the rally held a massive demonstration. They waved flags, placards, and protest letters, and shouted slogans as they marched along the bustling Nanjing Road. Thirty-one years ago, Shanghai workers and students fought bloody battles with the imperialists on this road.

As the crowd approached the office of Mr. Pulan, the chargé d'affaires of the British Representative Office in China on the Bund, the slogans became louder and louder. In this place, which was once the British Consulate in Shanghai, the gray wall still vaguely retains the slogan "Down with British Imperialism" written in asphalt by Shanghai students before liberation. The black iron gate here is tightly closed today. Angry crowds pasted the slogan "British and French Imperialists, Get Out of Egypt!" on the wall at its gate.

After ten minutes of negotiation, the masses sent nine representatives into Pulan's office to hand over the protest letter passed at the conference just now to Pulan. Wang Guanxu, a worker representative, read the protest letter passed by the conference to Pulan face to face. Xu Zhucheng, a journalist, also said to Pulan that the people of Shanghai demanded an immediate end to the cruel bombing of Egypt. Zhou Haizhen, a student from Shanghai First Medical College, said to Pulan: Go out and look at our team, listen to our voices! All our students in Shanghai firmly support the Egyptian people!

Famous film director Zhang Junxiang said: The six million people in Shanghai are very excited today. Mr. Chargé d'Affaires must also be very clear about this angry mood. I hope Mr. Chargé d'Affaires will also convey this to the British government.

Pulan replied to the representatives: I have seen these situations, and I guarantee to convey the protest letter and what you have said to the British government.

The demonstration was still continuing when it was dark.

    傍晚，参加集会的十万群众举行了声势浩大的示威游行。他们手里挥舞着旗帜、标语牌和抗议书，高喊着口号，走过了繁华的南京路。三十一年前，上海工人和学生曾在这条路上和帝国主义者进行过浴血搏斗。
    群众队伍逼近外滩英国驻华代办处浦澜参赞的办公处时，口号声愈喊愈响。在这个曾经是英国驻上海领事馆的地方，灰色的围墙上还隐约地留着解放前上海学生用柏油写的“打倒英帝国主义”的标语。这里的黑色铁门今天紧紧地关闭着。愤怒的群众在它的大门口的墙上贴上了“英法帝国主义滚出埃及去！”的标语。
    经过十分钟的交涉后，群众派出九位代表进入浦澜的办公处将刚才在大会上通过的抗议书交给浦澜。工人代表王关旭当面向浦澜宣读了大会通过的抗议书。新闻工作者徐铸成并对浦澜说，上海人民要求立即停止对埃及的残酷轰炸。上海第一医学院学生周海珍对浦澜说：出去看看我们的队伍，听听我们的声音吧！我们全上海学生都坚决支持埃及人民！
    著名电影导演张骏祥说：六百万上海人民今天非常激动。这种愤怒的情绪，参赞先生一定也很清楚。希望参赞先生把这一点也转告英国政府。
