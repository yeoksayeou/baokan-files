Xinhua News Agency, 15th dispatch: TASS reported: "Pravda" published today an editorial titled "Western European Laboring People Repulse the Conspiracies of Reactionaries and Fascists."

The editorial said that now, when the forces of peace led by the Soviet Union, China, and other socialist countries are making unremitting efforts to ease international tensions, the aggressive reactionary forces are also raising their heads to carry out rampant activities. Enraged by the achievements of the socialist countries and the unprecedented scale of the national liberation struggles of the Eastern peoples, the imperialist blocs are concocting conspiracies, attempting to hinder the great movement of the people of all countries toward freedom and social progress, and toward a bright future for all mankind.

Immediately following the Anglo-French invasion of Egypt, fascist thugs in France and Italy launched provocative attacks on the organs of the French and Italian Communist Parties. The ruling reactionary groups in Western Europe are also trying to use the recent Hungarian incident to incite anti-Communist hysteria. The failure of the Hungarian counter-revolutionary rebellion, supported by the ruling figures of imperialist countries, enraged these people. Reactionary propaganda organs distorted the actual situation in Hungary, using anti-Communist toxins to poison uninformed and gullible people.

The editorial continued, the purpose of the reactionaries in launching anti-Communist hysteria is first and foremost to attack the vanguard of the working class – the Communist Party. Reactionary forces have adopted the most insidious means, attempting to disintegrate the ranks of the international workers' movement. But they will not succeed. No fabricated propaganda, no suppression, and no means of terror can stop the people from fighting for the cause of peace and socialism. The Communist Party has been and will continue to be the vanguard of this lofty struggle. Communists realize that in order to block the path of reactionary and fascist forces, the unity of Communists and Socialists, as well as all democratic forces, is now more important than ever.

The editorial concluded that the attacks by fascist saboteurs in Western European countries show not their power, but the weakness of the reactionaries, and the dead end of the reactionary elements' doings. At the same time, the conspiracies of reactionary forces force all fighters for the cause of peace and socialism to raise their vigilance and strengthen their ranks. The united action of all progressive and democratic forces can block the path of reactionary and fascist forces. (Attached picture)

### 进步和民主力量一致行动  不让法西斯势力抬起头来  “真理报”评西欧反动派的反共暴行

    进步和民主力量一致行动  不让法西斯势力抬起头来
    “真理报”评西欧反动派的反共暴行
    新华社15日讯　据塔斯社报道：“真理报”在今天发表了题为“西欧劳动人民给反动派和法西斯的阴谋以反击”的一篇社论。
    社论说，现在，当苏联、中国和其他社会主义国家所领导的和平力量正在坚持不懈地争取缓和国际紧张局势的时候，侵略性的反动势力也抬起头来进行猖狂活动。为社会主义国家的成就和东方各国人民民族解放斗争的空前的规模所激怒了的帝国主义集团在制造阴谋计划，企图阻碍世界各国人民走向自由和社会进步，走向全人类的光辉未来的伟大运动。
    紧跟着英、法对埃及发动侵略之后，法国和意大利的法西斯暴徒就对法共和意共的机关发动了挑衅性的袭击。西欧当权反动集团还力图利用不久前发生的匈牙利事件煽动反共歇斯底里。得到帝国主义国家当权人士支持的匈牙利反革命分子暴动的失败使这些人士暴跳如雷。反动宣传机关歪曲匈牙利的实际情况，用反共毒素来毒害消息不灵通和轻信的人们。
    社论接着说，反动派发动反共歇斯底里的目的首先是要打击工人阶级的先锋队——共产党。反动势力采取了最阴险的手段，企图瓦解国际工人运动的队伍。但是他们不会成功。任何捏造的宣传、任何镇压和恐怖手段都不能阻止人民为和平和社会主义的事业而斗争。共产党过去和今后都是这个崇高斗争的先锋队。共产党人意识到，为了堵塞反动势力和法西斯势力的道路，现在共产党人和社会党人以及所有民主力量的团结一致比任何时候都更加重要。
    社论最后说，法西斯破坏分子在西欧国家的袭击所表明的不是他们的威力，而是反动派的软弱，以及反动分子所干的勾当的穷途末日。同时，反动势力的阴谋迫使所有为了和平和社会主义事业的斗士提高自己的警惕性和加强自己的队伍。所有进步和民主力量的一致行动能够堵塞反动和法西斯势力的道路。（附图片）
