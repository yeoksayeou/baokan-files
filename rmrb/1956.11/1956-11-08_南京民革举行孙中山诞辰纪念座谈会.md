Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, November 6th. The preparatory committee of the Jiangsu Provincial Branch of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang held a symposium on the morning of the 5th to commemorate the 90th anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's birth. More than eighty old members of the Tongmenghui and former KMT military and political personnel jointly wrote a letter to those in Taiwan who had followed Mr. Sun Yat-sen in revolutionary work, hoping that they would return to Nanjing to visit Sun Yat-sen's Mausoleum.

The symposium was presided over by Li Shijun, deputy director of the preparatory committee of the Jiangsu Provincial Branch of the Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee, and others. Many white-haired old men recounted their participation in the Tongmenghui in their youth, their influence by Mr. Sun Yat-sen's patriotic revolutionary ideas, and their experiences following Mr. Sun Yat-sen in revolutionary struggles. Wu Cangzhou, an old member of the Tongmenghui, seventy years old, recalled at the symposium how he accepted Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary ideas and joined the Tongmenghui. Wang Bihua, a female member who joined the Guangfuhui before the Tongmenghui and is now sixty-five years old, expressed at the meeting her hope that old friends in Taiwan could return to the motherland to reunite during the commemoration of Sun Yat-sen's birth. Xu Shilin, a former student of the first class of the Kuomintang Whampoa Military Academy, stated at the meeting that he hoped that the students of the Whampoa Military Academy in Taiwan could return to the mainland to continue to realize Mr. Sun Yat-sen's aspirations and participate in the construction of the motherland.

At the symposium, Li Xun'an, Li Gongcai, He Zheren, Tao Dekun, Zhou Weigang, Chen Tiancai, Lu Chengxi, Fan Tiren, Liu Yunzhao and other old members of the Tongmenghui and former KMT military and political personnel spoke successively. They all expressed their intention to learn from Mr. Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary thinking of constantly pursuing progress and his selfless patriotism, in order to contribute to the motherland's great socialist construction cause.
