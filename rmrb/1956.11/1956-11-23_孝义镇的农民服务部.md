    The Farmer Service Department of Xiaoyi Town
    Nan Cai
    Xiaoyi Town is a new factory and enterprise area within Gong County, Henan Province. Due to the continuous increase in population, the demand for vegetables in this area is also very large; however, the local vegetable production is very small. Before September, the daily supply of vegetables in Xiaoyi Town was about 1,500 jin, which could only meet about 15% of the needs of the masses. Due to the insufficient supply of vegetables, people buying vegetables and catering units were scrambling to buy them, and the masses were extremely dissatisfied with this phenomenon.
    In September, the Xiaoyi Town Farmer Trade Service Department was established. Thanks to the efforts of the service department, the daily supply of vegetables in Xiaoyi Town has increased to 8,000 jin, and at most it has reached 12,000 jin. Now the masses no longer need to get up at five in the morning to buy vegetables, and they can buy the varieties and quantities they need. The masses reflected: "The Farmer Trade Service Department has really solved a lot of problems for us."
    What work did the Xiaoyi Farmer Service Department do to solve the vegetable supply problem?
    They explained to the existing vegetable vendors the amount of vegetables needed in the Xiaoyi market, the method of free negotiation, and that the service department was responsible for solving sales problems, etc., and relied on the existing vegetable vendors to expand publicity, with vegetable vendors connecting with vegetable vendors. At the same time, the service department's traders also directly went deep into the agricultural cooperatives in the vegetable-producing areas, or used communication methods to contact other places to open up vegetable sources. As a result, not only did a large amount of vegetables from Huiguo Town, Caizhuang and other places 30 to 50 li around Xiaoyi appear in the Xiaoyi market, but even vegetables from Baoji, thousands of miles away, were continuously transported to Xiaoyi for sale.
    After the problem of vegetable supply was solved, how to ensure timely sales and reasonable prices became a very arduous task facing the service department.
    The service department appropriately and flexibly controlled the local vegetable prices based on the principle that it was beneficial to transporters and consumers did not suffer, and based on the vegetable season, the amount of vegetables on the market, and with reference to vegetable prices in other places. For example, when white radishes first came on the market, the quantity was small and there were many buyers. Vendors wanted eight cents a jin, and buyers were happy to pay. The service department made transactions at eight cents; after a large number of white radishes came on the market, the price per jin dropped from eight cents to five cents and four cents. Liu Zhen, a vendor from Baoji, transported 3,000 jin of potatoes, initially wanting to sell them for twelve cents a jin (the retail market price was eleven cents a jin at the time), but the buyer was only willing to pay eight cents. Finally, after negotiation by the trader, a deal was reached at nine cents a jin.
    In vegetable sales, due to the good contact between the service department and various units, the vegetables on the market that day could generally be sold out before noon. When the amount on the market exceeded demand and was not sold out by noon, the service department was responsible for helping them sell. For example, leaving some at a slightly lower than market price for large catering units or the local vegetable cooperative group; or, with the consent of the supply and marketing cooperative, the supply and marketing cooperative would purchase those suitable for pickle processing. The service department would not let vendors suffer losses on prices. When the above methods still could not solve the problem, the service department would purchase them and keep them for retail the next day.
    When the weather changes, or for other reasons, the amount of vegetables on the market cannot meet the needs of the masses, a portion of the vegetables on the market is reserved to take care of the needs of the retail market, and the remaining portion is appropriately allocated according to the actual needs of each catering unit to avoid the phenomenon of scramble purchasing.
    Currently, the amount of vegetables on the market in the Xiaoyi Farmer Service Department is maintained at a normal level, and the price is also stable. As the service department's prestige has increased, many vegetable-using units and vegetable vendors no longer come to the market and directly entrust the service department to make transactions for them. For example, Liu Xingwu, a vendor from Baoji, directly transported 1,500 jin of potatoes to the Xiaoyi Service Department on October 12, asking the service department to sell them for him according to the market price. Larger catering units in Xiaoyi Town only need to tell the service department the varieties and quantities they need the day before, and the service department will make transactions for them and have the vendors deliver them directly.
    The masses welcome the Xiaoyi Farmer Service Department. However, the service department also has some unreasonable systems, such as charging a 2% handling fee even when vegetable buyers and sellers trade directly. This needs to be studied and improved.

    孝义镇的农民服务部
    南采
    孝义镇是河南省巩县境内一个新的工厂企业区。由于人口不断增加，这个地区需要蔬菜的数量也很大；但是本地的蔬菜生产量却很小。在9月份以前，孝义镇每日蔬菜上市量约一千五百斤，只能满足群众需要量的15％左右。由于蔬菜供应不足，买菜的群众和伙食单位都争着抢购，群众对这种现象极为不满。
    9月间，孝义镇农民贸易服务部成立了。由于服务部的努力，孝义镇每日上市的蔬菜已增加到八千斤，最多时达到一万二千斤。现在群众买菜再也用不着起五更了，而且能够买到所需的品种和数量。群众反映：“农民贸易服务部，真给咱们解决了不少问题。”
    孝义农民服务部在解决蔬菜供应问题上做了哪些工作？
    他们向现有菜贩说明孝义市场需要的菜量、自由议价的办法，以及服务部负责解决销路等问题，并依靠现有菜贩扩大宣传，以菜贩串连菜贩。同时，服务部的贸易员还直接深入产菜区的农业社，或用通信方式与外地联系，开辟菜源。结果不仅孝义周围三、五十里的回郭镇、蔡庄等地的蔬菜大量出现在孝义市场上，连千里以外宝鸡的菜，也源源运来孝义出售。
    蔬菜货源问题解决以后，如何保证及时推销并做到价格合理，就成为摆在服务部面前的一个很艰巨的任务。
    服务部根据贩运者有利和消费者不吃亏的原则，并根据蔬菜季节、上市量多少以及参考外地的蔬菜价格，适当灵活掌握当地蔬菜的价格。如白萝卜刚上市时是量小买主多，小贩要八分钱一斤，买的人也乐意要，服务部就以八分成交；白萝卜大量上市以后，每斤就由八分降到五分、四分。宝鸡小贩刘振运来三千斤土豆，开始要按一角二分一斤成交（当时零星市场是一角一斤），而买方只肯出八分。最后经贸易员协商，以九分一斤成交了。
    在蔬菜推销工作上，由于服务部和各单位联系的好，当天上市的蔬菜，一般的在中午以前都可推销出去。当上市量超过需要，而到中午销售不完时候，服务部就负责帮助他们推销。比如，以稍低于市场的价格让大的伙食单位或本集的蔬菜合作小组留下；或者是把适合酱菜加工需要的，在取得供销社的同意以后，由供销社收购。在价格上不使小贩吃亏。通过以上办法还解决不了的时候，服务部就收购起来，留到第二天再零售。
    在天气发生变化，或因为其他原因，蔬菜上市量不能满足群众需要的时候，对上市的蔬菜，留一部分照顾零售市场需要，其余部分则根据各伙食单位的实际需要量，适当分配，以免发生争购现象。
    目前，孝义农民服务部蔬菜的上市量维持在正常的水平上，价格也是稳定的。由于服务部的威信日益提高，很多用菜单位和卖菜小贩都不到市场上来，直接委托服务部替他们成交。如宝鸡菜贩刘兴武10月12日把一千五百斤土豆直接起运到孝义服务部，叫服务部根据市价替他出售。孝义镇比较大的伙食单位，只要在头一天把需要的品种和数量告诉服务部，第二天服务部就替他们交易，并由小贩直接送去。
    群众对孝义农民服务部是欢迎的。但是服务部也还有些不合理的制度，如蔬菜买卖双方直接交易，服务部也收2％的手续费。这一点需要研究改进。
