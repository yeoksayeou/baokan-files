    Go and See for Yourself
  　Wang Jingyu
    In April of this year, Li Changlan, a female worker at the joint state-private Hehua Weaving Factory in Weifang City, applied to the trade union for a relief fund of fifteen yuan to repair her house. When the trade union committee was discussing this issue, the vice chairman said, "Don't rush, rushing can easily lead to deviations." Some trade union committee members also said, "Li Changlan's output is low and her quality is poor, so she shouldn't receive relief." The issue was thus shelved.
    One day, a letter from the people requesting relief for Li Changlan was sent to Comrade Cui Yuchun, the Party branch secretary. Comrade Cui immediately consulted with the trade union vice chairman. The vice chairman still disagreed with providing assistance, so Cui Yuchun suggested, "Let's go to Li Changlan's home and take a look." The trade union vice chairman hesitated for a moment, and then agreed.
    The Party branch secretary, the trade union vice chairman, and the labor insurance committee member arrived at Li Changlan's home. Changlan's mother greeted the guests in a dilapidated small thatched house. This small room housed Changlan's entire family of seven. Besides the mother's income of just over ten yuan a month from odd jobs, the entire family's livelihood depended on Changlan's monthly salary of twenty-eight yuan.
    "...When it rains during the day, the family can still hide in the corner of the wall. When it rains at night, the whole family has to squat on the ground all night. When the rain gets heavy, we're afraid the house will collapse, so we go to the neighbors to borrow a place to stay. When it clears up, we use soil and wheat chaff to fill in the leaking spots..." The mother recounted with bitterness.
    Before the old woman could finish speaking, the trade union vice chairman, who had previously disagreed with providing relief, anxiously began to examine his mistakes. He said, "We must help Changlan's family repair their house, no matter what."
    Hearing that the factory was going to help repair the house, Li Changlan's family and relatives and neighbors were overjoyed. Some relatives and neighbors were willing to provide wood, while others were willing to provide labor. The factory subsidized forty yuan for the house repairs. On the day of the repairs, the labor insurance committee member and the office manager were sent to provide guidance and assistance.
    Changlan's house no longer leaks, the factory subsidized her living expenses, her output and quality have improved, the number of machines she watches has also increased, and she has guaranteed 100% product quality for twenty-six consecutive days.
    Li Changlan's story tells us that only by going deep into reality can we rid ourselves of bureaucracy and subjectivism in our work.

    亲自去看看
  　王荆玉
    今年四月，潍坊市公私合营兴华织布厂的女工李长兰，向工会申请救济金十五元修补房子。工会委员会研究这个问题的时候，副主席说：“不要急，急了容易出偏差”。有的工会委员也说：“李长兰的产量少，质量低，不能救济。”问题就这样搁下了。
    一天，一封要求救济李长兰的人民来信，寄到党支部书记崔雨春同志手里。崔同志立即找工会副主席研究。副主席仍然不同意补助，于是崔雨春就提议：“咱们到李长兰家里去看看”。工会副主席犹豫了一会，便答应了。
    党支部书记，工会副主席和劳保委员来到了李长兰家里。长兰母亲在一间破烂的小草房里迎接了客人。这间小房住着长兰全家七口人。全家的生活，除了母亲每月干短工能收入十多元外，就靠长兰每月收入二十八元的工资来过活。
    “……白天下雨，一家人还能在墙角躲躲。晚上下雨，全家大小就得在地上蹲一夜。雨下大了，怕房子倒，就跑到邻家借宿。天晴了，再用土和麦糠把漏雨的地方垫一垫……”母亲辛酸地诉说着。
    老人的话还没有说完，早先不同意救济的工会副主席就急得检讨起来了。他说：“无论如何也得帮助长兰家修补房子。”
    听说厂里要帮助修房子，这可乐坏了李长兰一家和亲戚邻居。亲戚邻居中有的愿出木料，有的愿出人工，厂里补助了四十元的修房费。修房的那天，并派劳保委员和事务长前来进行指导和帮助。
    长兰家的房子不再漏雨了，厂里补助了她的生活费用，她的产量、质量提高了，看的机器台数也增加了，并且连续二十六天保证了百分之百的产品质量。
    李长兰的故事告诉我们，只有深入到实际中去，才能摆脱我们工作中的官僚主义和主观主义。
