Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 20th: TASS reports that the Polish United Workers' Party Central Committee and the Polish government delegation, upon leaving Soviet territory, sent a telegram to the leaders of the Soviet Communist Party and government, Khrushchev, Voroshilov, and Bulganin, thanking them for the sincere and friendly reception in the Soviet Union. The telegram stated: We are convinced that the results of our visit will greatly deepen the fraternal friendship and cooperation between Poland and the Soviet Union, consolidate the alliance between Poland and the Soviet Union, and strengthen the solidarity of the socialist countries' camp in defending the cause of peace and international security.

Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, 20th: The Polish United Workers' Party Central Committee and the Polish government delegation returned to Warsaw from Moscow on the 19th.

Members of the Political Bureau of the Polish United Workers' Party Central Committee, members of the State Council and the government, and representatives of various social organizations welcomed them at the station. Soviet Charge d'Affaires ad interim to Poland, Mr. Bernov, and diplomatic envoys from various countries to Warsaw were also present at the station to welcome them.

Gomulka, the head of the delegation, said at the station: During the four days of our stay in Moscow, the issues that had accumulated over several years were resolved in the meetings and talks with the Soviet comrades.

The leaders of the Soviet state and the leaders of the Soviet Communist Party received us very warmly and, through us, expressed their sincerity to the entire Polish people. They have removed everything abnormal and incorrect from the past Polish-Soviet relations. In addition to deciding on some matters, they decided to resolve all claims arising from our past mutual trade by canceling Poland's huge debt, which exceeds two billion rubles.

We have satisfactorily resolved all issues related to the relationship between Poland and the Soviet Union.

All obstacles have been removed on the road to strengthening Polish-Soviet relations. This friendship does not arise from a government order, but from the hearts and minds of the entire Polish people.

Gomulka concluded: Our talks with the representatives of the Soviet Communist Party and the Soviet government were talks between two equal partners, both inspired by a common socialist spirit and the spirit of good-neighborly and friendly relations between the entire Polish people and the various peoples of the Soviet Union. Let us develop these friendly relations, which are necessary for both us and our great eastern neighbor, the Soviet Union.

    波兰代表团回到华沙
    哥穆尔卡说必须发展波苏友好
    新华社20日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：波兰统一工人党中央委员会和波兰政府代表团在离开苏联国境的时候，拍给苏联共产党和政府的领导人赫鲁晓夫、伏罗希洛夫和布尔加宁一封电报，感谢在苏联所受到的衷心和友好的接待。电报说：我们深信，我们访问的结果将大大加深兄弟友谊和波苏的合作，巩固波兰同苏联的联盟，同时加强捍卫和平事业和国际安全的社会主义国家阵营的团结。
    新华社华沙20日电　波兰统一工人党中央委员会和波兰政府代表团19日由莫斯科回到华沙。
    波兰统一工人党中央委员会政治局委员、国务委员会委员和政府成员、各社会团体代表到车站欢迎。到车站欢迎的还有苏联驻波兰临时代办别尔诺夫和各国驻华沙使节。
    代表团团长哥穆尔卡在车站上说：在我们逗留在莫斯科的四天中，在同苏联同志进行的会议和会谈中，在若干年中积累起来的问题都已经解决了。
    苏联国家的领袖们和苏联共产党的领袖们，非常热诚地接待我们并且通过我们表示对波兰全体人民的诚意，他们已经勾销了过去波苏关系中一切不正常和不正确的东西。他们除了已经决定了一些事情外，更决定了以取消波兰的巨大债务的方式来解决我们在过去的互相贸易中产生的一切要求；这种债务超过了二十亿卢布。
    我们已经圆满地解决了同波兰和苏联之间的相互关系有关的一切问题。
    在加强波苏关系的道路上，一切障碍都已经去掉了，这种友谊不是从政府的一纸命令产生的，而是从波兰全国人民的心里和智慧中产生的。
    哥穆尔卡最后说：我们同苏联共产党的代表和苏联政府之间的会谈，是两个平等伙伴之间的会谈，他们都是受到共同的社会主义精神以及波兰全国人民和苏联各族人民之间的善邻友好关系的精神所鼓舞的。让我们发展这些对我们和我们伟大的东邻苏联都需要的友好关系。
