    Weapons Concealed in "Medicines," Red Cross "Officials" Mostly Bandits
    Hungary Suspends Acceptance of "Parcels" from Western Red Cross Societies
    Xinhua News Agency, November 11th: According to a report by the Hungarian News Agency on November 9th, TASS reported that on November 4th, the Hungarian Revolutionary Worker-Peasant Government took measures to temporarily suspend accepting parcels sent by Western Red Cross societies.
    The Hungarian government took this measure because, during the inspection of goods arriving on thirty planes on November 2nd and seventy planes on November 3rd, it was discovered that some of the goods sent by the Red Cross, labeled as "medicines," contained weapons. Furthermore, it was also discovered that some of the Red Cross personnel registered as escorting the goods were former fascist officers from the Horthy army and gendarmerie who had previously resided in West Germany.
    Under these circumstances, the Hungarian government had no choice but to temporarily suspend accepting parcels from Western Red Cross societies.
    The Hungarian Revolutionary Worker-Peasant Government is grateful to the International Red Cross organization for sending urgently needed medicines to Hungary. Therefore, the Hungarian government immediately and gladly agreed to the proposal from the International Red Cross organization conveyed by the Yugoslav Ambassador to Budapest on November 8th. According to this proposal, parcels will be transported to Budapest via Yugoslavia. The Hungarian government believes that this will ensure that the aforementioned malicious misuse of Red Cross parcels will not occur again.

    “药品”中夹带武器红十字会“官员”多是匪徒
    匈暂停接受西方国家红十字会的“包裹”
    新华社11日讯　据塔斯社引匈牙利通讯社9日的报道说，11月4日，匈牙利工农革命政府采取措施，暂时停止接受西方国家红十字会寄来的包裹。
    匈牙利政府所以采取这一措施是由于在检查11月2日三十架飞机和11月3日七十架飞机所装的货物中，发现红十字会寄来的、注明为“药品”的货物中有一部分是武器。另外还发现，在登记说是押送货物的红十字会人员中有一部分人是以前居住在西德的旧霍尔蒂军队和宪兵队的法西斯军官。
    匈牙利政府在这种情况下不得不暂时停止接受西方国家红十字会的包裹。
    匈牙利工农革命政府感谢国际红十字会组织寄来的匈牙利迫切需要的药品。因此，匈牙利政府立刻欣然同意了11月8日由南斯拉夫驻布达佩斯大使转达的国际红十字会组织的建议。根据这一建议，包裹将经过南斯拉夫运到布达佩斯。匈牙利政府认为这样将可以保证不再发生上述恶意利用红十字会包裹的事情。
