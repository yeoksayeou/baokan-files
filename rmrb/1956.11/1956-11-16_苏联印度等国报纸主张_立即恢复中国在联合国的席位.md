Soviet, Indian, and Other Countries' Newspapers Advocate for Immediate Restoration of China's Seat in the United Nations

    Soviet "Izvestia"
    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 14th. TASS reports: "Izvestia" published an editorial today titled "Immediately Restore China's Legitimate Rights in the United Nations!"
    The editorial states that India has formally submitted a proposal to the 11th session of the United Nations General Assembly, which is opening in New York, to include the issue of China's representation in the United Nations on the agenda. This move by India, aimed at eliminating the intolerable and illegal attitude towards the great Chinese people, has been fully endorsed by all peace-loving people.
    India's proposal reflects the views of many member states of the United Nations. The issue of restoring China's legitimate representation in the United Nations has been raised repeatedly in recent years. It has become increasingly clear that the legitimate rights of the Chinese people cannot be ignored. The United States' short-sighted policy is primarily responsible for the blatant violation of the UN Charter on this issue.
    "Izvestia" points out that an increasing number of countries recognize the People's Republic of China and establish normal diplomatic relations with it. China's international prestige as a peace-loving major power has grown immeasurably, and no important international issue can be resolved now without China's participation.
    China is legally a member state of the United Nations, so the issue now is merely one of the representation of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations, not of admitting it or allowing it to join this international organization. Precisely because of this, those who oppose the entry of representatives of the People's Republic of China into the United Nations have neither legal arguments nor logical arguments to defend their untenable position, so they can only evade discussion of the issue of the representation of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations.
    The editorial says that the call for the restoration of the rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations resounds throughout the world. This demand is becoming louder and more widespread in Asia and Europe, in Africa and Latin America.
    The editorial concludes that world public opinion expects the 11th session of the United Nations General Assembly to meet the demands of the people of all countries, and that the People's Republic of China will be able to legally obtain its due position in the United Nations. The issue of restoring China's legitimate rights in the United Nations must be resolved immediately. This is the order of the times, this is the demand of the people of all countries.

    Indian "Amrita Bazar Patrika"
    Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 15th. The Indian "Amrita Bazar Patrika" editorial on November 14 supports India's motion to include the issue of restoring China's legitimate status in the United Nations on the agenda of the United Nations General Assembly. The editorial wrote: "It is a disgrace that the Kuomintang regime in Taiwan, which represents no one, continues to occupy the legitimate seat of the People's Republic of China."
    "Today India" newspaper pointed out that there are many countries in the United Nations that support China's acquisition of representation. The newspaper hopes that in view of the growing support for China, "Washington will reconsider its uncompromising policy of opposing the representation of the Chinese Communist Party."

    Czechoslovak "Red Right"
    Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 15th. Czechoslovak newspapers published articles on the 14th, calling for the restoration of China's legitimate rights in the United Nations Organization.
    "Red Right" denounced the United States in its article for stubbornly trying to prevent China from enjoying legitimate representation in the United Nations Organization, and recounted the condemnation of the United States' ostrich policy by world public opinion. The newspaper said that world public opinion has long recognized the importance of China and fully knows that the presence of the legitimate representatives of the Chinese people in the United Nations Organization will make a great contribution to this supreme world organization and to the cause of peace. The US policy will eventually end in the same failure as the "open door" policy once adopted towards colonial China.
    "Labor Daily" believes that no important issue on the agenda of the United Nations General Assembly can be resolved without China's participation. The newspaper emphasized that the shameless aggression against Egypt by British and French imperialists places a heavy responsibility on the Security Council and the United Nations General Assembly, therefore, the presence of China's legitimate representatives in the United Nations Organization is absolutely necessary.

### 苏联印度等国报纸主张  立即恢复中国在联合国的席位

    苏联印度等国报纸主张
    立即恢复中国在联合国的席位
    苏联“消息报”
    新华社14日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：“消息报”今天发表一篇题为“立即恢复中国在联合国的合法权利！”的社论。
    社论说，印度已经正式将一项关于把中国在联合国的代表权问题列入联大议程的建议提交在纽约开幕的联合国大会第十一届会议讨论。印度这个旨在消除对伟大中国人民不可容忍的非法态度的举动，得到了全体爱好和平的人民的完全赞同。
    印度的建议反映了联合国许多会员国的意见。关于恢复中国在联合国的合法代表权的问题，在最近几年中曾经一再提出。不容忽视中国人民的合法权利这一点，一次比一次更加清楚。在这个问题上粗暴破坏联合国宪章的首先是美国的近视政策。
    “消息报”指出，承认中华人民共和国和同它建立正常外交关系的国家越来越多。中国作为爱好和平的大国的国际威信无法衡量地增长了，现在如果没有中国参加，任何重要的国际问题都不能得到解决。
    中国在法律上是联合国会员国，因此现在只是一个中华人民共和国在联合国中的代表权的问题，而不是接纳它或让它加入这个国际组织的问题。正因为如此，反对中华人民共和国代表进入联合国的人既没有法律论据，也没有逻辑论据来为自己站不住脚的立场作辩护，所以只有逃避讨论中华人民共和国在联合国中代表权的问题。
    社论说，要求恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的权利的呼声响遍全世界。这种要求在亚洲和欧洲、在非洲和拉丁美洲日益响亮，日益普遍。
    社论最后说，世界舆论期待，联合国大会第十一届会议将能满足各国人民的要求，中华人民共和国将能依法得到它在联合国中应有的位置。必须立即解决关于恢复中国在联合国中合法权利的问题。这是时代的命令，这是各国人民的要求。
    印度“甘露市场报”
    新华社新德里15日电　印度“甘露市场报”11月14日的社论支持印度要求把恢复中国在联合国的合法地位问题列入联合国大会议程的动议。社论写道：“不代表任何人的台湾国民党政权继续占据中华人民共和国的合法席位是件不体面的事情。”
    “今日印度”报指出，在联合国中有许多国家是支持中国取得代表权的。这家报纸希望鉴于人们对中国的支持日益增长，“华盛顿将会重新考虑它的毫不妥协地反对中国共产党的代表权的政策”。
    捷“红色权利报”
    新华社布拉格15日电　捷克斯洛伐克报纸14日发表文章，呼吁恢复中国在联合国组织中的合法权利。
    “红色权利报”在文章中斥责美国顽固地设法阻止中国在联合国组织中享有合法代表权，并且追述了世界舆论对美国的鸵鸟政策的谴责。这家报纸说，世界舆论早已认识到中国的重要性，并且充分知道中国人民的合法代表出席联合国组织将要对这个最高的世界组织和对和平事业作出巨大的贡献。美国的政策终于将会像过去有一个时候对殖民地中国采取的“门户开放”政策一样，遭到同样的失败而结束。
    “劳动报”认为，在没有中国参加的情况下，联合国大会的议程上没有一个重要问题会得到解决。报纸强调指出，英、法帝国主义者对埃及的厚颜无耻的侵略，使安全理事会和联合国大会身上负有重大责任，因此，中国的合法代表出席联合国组织是绝对必要的。
