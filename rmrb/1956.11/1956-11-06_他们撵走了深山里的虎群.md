They Drove Away the Tiger Pack in the Deep Mountains
Ye Yao

Defense mapping soldier Ren Xuelei, carrying surveying instruments, and the civilian workers, carrying luggage and tents, arrived at the foot of Beida Mountain in Dexing County, Jiangxi Province at dusk. There were only a few scattered households living there. They found some local villagers and wanted them to guide them up the mountain at night. The villagers waved their hands and said, "There are no roads on the mountain. This is a deep mountain forest, and there are many tigers on the mountain that injure people. We don't have the guts to go up the mountain!"

One villager pointed to the dense forest on the mountain and said, "There is a small path there, which the People's Liberation Army comrades cut out with knives while walking a few days ago."

"Ah, that's where the comrades from our surveying team went to select points and build markers," Ren Xuelei said, feeling hopeful after hearing there was a road.

"Are there many tigers on the mountain?" a civilian worker asked timidly.

"They come in packs. At night, they often come down the mountain to eat cattle and pigs. As soon as it gets dark, we bolt our doors tightly, fearing that the tiger pack will injure people. If you two go up at night, I guarantee you won't even be able to pick up your bones."

The villagers advised them to stay. Ren Xuelei looked up at the sky, which was blue and clear, without a single cloud, the moon was out, and the sky was full of stars. His field experience told him that the weather in the mountains is fickle. At this moment it is a clear sky, but in a moment it might be dark clouds, or even a downpour. Every minute of good weather is precious to the surveyors, otherwise, they would be forced to stop working if it rained. He was determined to go up the mountain tonight so that he could start working tomorrow. He spent a lot of time persuading the villagers to guide them up the mountain. Even though his mouth was dry and his throat was parched, the villagers still shook their heads and waved their hands. Ren Xuelei thought, "Everyone says there are many tigers and they are fierce, but I have never seen them. What's so great about them!"

He and the civilian worker left their luggage and tents at the villager's house. The two of them carried the instruments on their backs and climbed up the mountain step by step along the only small path. By the moonlight, they saw that this small path was opened up from the dense forest. The newly felled trees were lying on both sides of the road, and there was still the smell of fresh wood. The fallen leaves in the forest were a foot thick, and a strong musty smell wafted towards them. Some ancient dead trees were broken, probably struck by lightning. The dense forest was full of tall pine trees and locust trees, and the breeze rustled through them.

The mountain was not high, only eight hundred meters. However, the small path was only a foot wide, with slippery green grass and moss, making it difficult to climb. Their clothes were already soaked with sweat. They stopped halfway up the mountain to catch their breath. As soon as they stopped, they were both stunned: in a mountain depression only twenty meters away from them, six yellow tigers were crouching, four adults and two cubs. This was probably a tiger family, full from eating, preparing to sleep. Hearing the sound of people, they became alert, each glaring at them, roaring menacingly.

The civilian worker was already a little scared, and when he suddenly saw the tiger pack, he almost screamed. Ren Xuelei's heart was also pounding, but he was an old soldier after all and quickly calmed down. He pushed the civilian worker and said softly, "You run down the mountain quickly, I'll deal with them behind you!" The civilian worker's legs were already weak, his teeth chattering, and he stood there unable to move. Ren Xuelei protected the civilian worker with his back, holding him, facing the tiger pack, and walking backward step by step. When the trees obscured the tiger pack, they ran down the mountain along the small path.

Back at the villager's house, the villagers surrounded them, scolding them, "You didn't believe us when we said there was a tiger pack, did you? We weren't lying, were we!"

Ren Xuelei was eager to work on the mountain, and he persuaded the villagers again in a gentle tone, "Let's go up the mountain with a few more people. With more people, the tigers will be afraid no matter how fierce they are." At first, the villagers still shook their heads and refused, but later, the villagers were finally persuaded by him. A total of six of them, carrying shoulder poles, sticks, and torches, shouted as they walked up the mountain. When they reached the mountain depression where they had encountered the tigers, the tigers had already been scared away. At midnight, they successfully reached the top of the mountain.

Following that, the main force of the surveying station came, and tents were set up on the top of the mountain. The tiger pack often circled around the mountain; in the dead of night, the roars of the tiger pack often woke them from their dreams. There was no water on the top of the mountain, so they had to go down the mountain every day to cook. Early the next morning, as the sky was just beginning to dawn, Ren Xuelei, who was temporarily responsible for cooking, carried a bag of rice down the mountain. As soon as he walked down the mountain, a large tiger squatted on the path, blocking his way. Ren Xuelei immediately turned back. The group leader then sent a public security soldier with a submachine gun to go with him. They walked along, shouting and coughing loudly. The tiger stood up, glared, bared its teeth, and roared menacingly at them. The two sides confronted each other for a while, and the tiger finally walked slowly along the ridge, turning its head every step.

In the following days, they often encountered one or two tigers in the mountains, and they all used the same method to scare the tigers away. Although the tigers were still "friendly" to them, everyone was worried that the tigers would become wild and injure people. They came up with a way: in the morning, before the people cooking went down the mountain, everyone stood on the top of the mountain and shouted and yelled; they found dead tree stumps from the forest and lit several piles of fire on the top of the mountain. The sound of people roaring, the bright flames, and the strong smell of smoke scared the tigers away.

A week later, when they successfully completed their mission and went down the mountain to meet the villagers, the villagers gave them a thumbs up and said, "You truly deserve to be called the People's Liberation Army, well done! You have taken over the tiger's den on Beida Mountain, and the tiger pack has moved to the South Mountain. We haven't heard the tiger pack roaring these past few nights." (Attached picture)

    他们撵走了深山里的虎群
    叶遥
    国防测绘兵任学礼背着司光仪器，民工挑着行李和帐篷，在黄昏时分赶到了江西省德兴县北大山脚下。这里零零落落住有几户人家。他们找到几个老乡，想请老乡带路，夜里上山。老乡向他们摆摆手说：“山上没有路，这是深山老林，山上虎多伤人，我们可没吃豹子胆，谁敢上山！”
    有一位指指山上茂密的树林说：“那里有条小路，还是前些天解放军同志边走边用刀砍出来的。”
    “啊，那是我们测绘队选点造标的同志上去过。”任学礼听说有路觉得有希望了。
    “山上老虎多吗？”民工胆怯地问道。
    “成群结队的。夜里它们常下山吃牛、吃猪。天一黑，我们都把门拴得牢牢的，怕虎群伤人。你们两个人夜里上去，保管连你们的骨头渣也拣不回来。”
    老乡劝他俩住下。任学礼抬头看看天，天蓝蔚蔚的，一丝云彩也没有，月亮出来了，满天星斗。他的野外生活经验告诉他，山区里的天气变化是无常的。这时是万里晴空，说不定一会就是乌云满天，甚至落起倾盆大雨来。每一分钟的好天气，对测绘兵都是宝贵的，不然遇上阴天下雨，他们便要被迫停止工作。他打定主意今夜一定上山，明天就可以开始工作。他费了不少唇舌，劝说老乡给带路上山。嘴干舌渴了，老乡仍是摇头、摆手。任学礼想：“都说虎群多，厉害，可我没有见过，有啥了不起！”
    他和民工把行李、帐篷留在老乡家里，两人分背着仪器，沿着山上唯一的小路，一步一步往上爬。借着月光，他们看到这条小路是从茂密的树林里开出来的，新砍倒的树木躺在路两边，还有新木头的香味呢。林中的枯树叶足有尺把厚，一股股浓烈的霉味向他们扑来。有些古老的枯树折断了，大概是被雷劈的。密林里长满了高大的松树和刺儿槐，微风刮过，沙沙作响。
    山不算高，只有八百多公尺。可是小路只有一脚来宽，青草绿苔，滑溜溜的，真难爬。他们的衣服早被汗水浸透了，爬到半山腰，他们停下来喘喘气。刚站住脚，两人同时楞住了：距他们仅仅二十来公尺远的山凹里，蹲着六只黄色老虎，四只大的，两只小的，大概这是一个虎的家族，吃饱了，准备睡觉呢。听到人声，它们警觉起来，个个瞪眼望着他们，“呜呜”地叫着发威。
    那位民工本来就有些害怕，猛一见虎群，几乎惊叫起来。任学礼心里也卜通卜通的，可是他到底是个老战士，很快镇静下来了。他推了民工一把，轻轻地说：“你快跑下山去，我在你后面对付它们！”民工腿早软了，牙??响，站在那里一步也挪不动。任学礼背身护着民工，手扶住他，脸朝着虎群，一步一步往后退着走。当树林遮住了虎群的时候，他们沿小路跑下山来。
    回到老乡住处，老乡们把他们围起来，七言八语责备他们：“说有虎群你们不信，怎样？没说谎吧！”
    任学礼上山工作的心切，又好言好语劝说老乡：“我们多几个人上山吧，人多势众，老虎再凶也怕人。”开始，老乡仍摇头，摆手拒绝，后来，老乡终于被他说服了。他们一共六个人，拿着扁担、棍子、火把，一边吆吆喝喝，一边往山上走。走到刚才遇虎的山凹，老虎早吓跑了。午夜，他们顺利地到达山顶。
    跟着，测绘站的大队人马来了，山顶上搭起了帐篷。虎群常绕着山头转来转去；夜深人静，虎群的吼叫声常把他们从梦中惊醒。山顶上没有水，每天得到山下做饭。第一天清晨，天刚蒙蒙亮，临时担任做饭的任学礼扛着米袋下山去了，刚走下山头，一只大虎蹲在小道上，拦住了去路。任学礼马上折回。组长又派了一个公安战士，拿着冲锋枪和他同去。他们一路走，一路大声吆喝，咳嗽。老虎站起来瞪眼、眦牙，“呜呜”地向他们发威。双方对峙了一阵，老虎终于一步一回头，慢吞吞地沿着山梁走开了。
    以后几天，他们在山腰里也经常遇到一两只虎，也都用同样的方法把虎吓走了。虽然老虎对他们还算“友善”，但大家不放心，怕虎一旦发起野性来伤人，他们想出了一个办法：早上，做饭的人未下山前，大家站在山头上放开嗓子吼叫、吆喝；从树林里找来枯树椿子，在山头上点起几堆火。人吼声，熊熊的火光和浓烈的烟味，吓得老虎走远了。
    一星期后，当他们胜利完成任务下山和老乡见面的时候，老乡们伸出大拇指说：“你们真不愧是解放军，好样的！北大山上的老虎窝叫你们给占了，虎群搬到南山上去了。这几天夜里我们再听不到虎群吼叫了。”（附图片）
