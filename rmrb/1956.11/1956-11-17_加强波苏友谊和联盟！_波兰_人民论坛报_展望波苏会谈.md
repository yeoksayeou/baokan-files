    Strengthen Polish-Soviet Friendship and Alliance!
    "People's Tribune" of Poland Looks Forward to Polish-Soviet Talks
    Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, November 16th. The Polish "People's Tribune" published a commentary on the Polish-Soviet talks on the 15th, stating that this is not an ordinary diplomatic visit. This meeting will play a historically important role in the development of Polish-Soviet relations and will also have important significance on the international stage.
    The commentary pointed out that for us, the Polish-Soviet alliance is the most important and fundamental issue. What is its foundation? First, Poland, with its western territories bordering the Oder-Neisse line, is still an eyesore to some forces in the West. These forces have not forgotten the interests of the Junkers in the coastal areas, the metallurgical enterprises of Silesia, and the shipyards of Gdansk. It is these forces that are arming West Germany and threatening the security of our borders. It is these forces that formed the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, to which the Warsaw Pact is the answer. The Warsaw Pact is a guarantee against all aggression. Second, Poland's position is on the main road of the historical "Drang nach Osten," and the experience of the past twenty years has shown that this is not a theoretical issue. The bombing of Warsaw was a prelude to the invasion of Moscow. In the fascist aggression, the Polish people suffered losses second only to the Soviet Union. Third, both Poland and the Soviet Union are socialist countries. Neither country is willing to conquer other countries. On the contrary, both countries are led by parties with common ideals based on Marxism-Leninism as their program and basis for action. All of this makes the relationship between our two countries not only a neighborly relationship but also a friendly alliance.
    The commentary pointed out that the Soviet army's liberation of Poland in the Second World War and Poland's abolition of large land ownership and the capitalist system created the possibility for establishing a new type of relationship between Poland and the Soviet Union - a socialist relationship. Eliminating all phenomena that hinder our relations in order to strengthen Polish-Soviet friendship and alliance is the most important task of our delegation's visit to Moscow.
    The commentary said that the Eighth Plenary Session of the Polish United Workers' Party and the Soviet government's statement on October 30th have clearly pointed out that the mutual relations between socialist countries should be based on complete equality, mutual respect for territorial integrity, independence and sovereignty, and non-interference in internal affairs. Anyone who expects Poland to weaken its solidarity with socialist countries is engaging in futile and self-deceptive efforts. On the contrary, we will strive to strengthen the friendship and mutual assistance of socialist countries in all aspects. Our people and public opinion are closely following the progress of the Polish-Soviet talks, because many issues depend on this meeting. Strengthening the Polish-Soviet alliance will help further strengthen Poland. The Polish working class and working people unanimously place great expectations on the talks.

    加强波苏友谊和联盟！
    波兰“人民论坛报”展望波苏会谈
    新华社华沙16日电　波兰“人民论坛报”15日就波兰和苏联的会谈发表评论说，这不是一次普通的外交访问，这次会谈在波苏关系的发展上将起历史性的重要作用，在国际舞台上也将有重要的意义。
    评论指出，对我们来说，波苏联盟是最重要的基本性的问题。它的基础是什么呢？首先，以奥得—尼斯河为界的、拥有自己西部领土的波兰还是西方某些势力的眼中钉。这些势力并未忘记沿海地区的容克地主的利益、西里西亚的冶金企业和革但斯克的造船厂。正是这些势力在武装着西德，威胁着我国的边界的安全。正是这些势力组成了北大西洋公约，华沙条约就是对它的回答。华沙条约是防御一切侵略的保证。其次，波兰的地位处在历史上的“向东进军”的主要道路上，过去二十年来的经验已经说明这不是一个理论问题。轰炸华沙就是侵犯莫斯科的前奏。在法西斯的侵略中，波兰人民所受的巨大损失只次于苏联。第三，波兰和苏联都是社会主义国家。两国都不愿征服其它的国家，相反，两国都是由以马克思列宁主义为纲领和行动的基础的具有共同理想的党所领导的。所有这些都使我们两国的关系不但是睦邻的关系，而且能结成友好的联盟。
    评论指出，苏军在第二次世界大战中解放波兰和波兰废除大土地所有制和资本主义制度，为在波苏之间建立新型的关系——社会主义的关系创造了可能性。消除妨害我们关系的一切现象以加强波苏友谊和联盟，这是我国代表团访问莫斯科的最主要的任务。
    评论说，波兰统一工人党八中全会和10月30日苏联政府的声明都已经明确指出，社会主义各国的相互关系应建筑在完全平等、尊重领土完整、独立和主权和互不干涉内政的基础上。任何期望波兰将会削弱它同社会主义国家的团结的人们，都是枉费心机的和自欺欺人的。相反，我们将努力加强社会主义各国在各方面的友谊和互助。我国人民和社会舆论密切地关注着波苏会谈的进程，因为有许多问题取决于这次会谈。加强波苏联盟有助于进一步加强波兰。波兰工人阶级和劳动人民都一致地对会谈寄以很大的期望。
