Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, November 14th (Xinhua News Agency reporter Tao Jin Yan): The financial and economic departments of Xishui County, Hubei Province, have corrected the tendency of agricultural cooperatives to engage extensively in commerce, guiding farmers to carry out normal free trade.

Since the opening of free markets under state leadership in Xishui County in August, there has been a phenomenon of agricultural cooperatives universally engaging in commerce. Some agricultural cooperatives have invested even more in commerce than in autumn planting and winter sowing. They opened department stores, grocery stores, and small shops with large sums of money, purchasing goods for business. Many township cadres and agricultural cooperative cadres were unclear about the meaning of free trade for farmers, regarding business as a shortcut to improving the lives of cooperative members, and supporting members in organizing transportation and marketing teams to purchase and transport large quantities of goods (including state-unified purchase materials) to obtain commercial profits. This affected the state's unified purchase of grain, oil, and other materials, and the turnover of small traders also declined as a result.

After discovering these situations, the financial and economic departments of Xishui County first conducted policy and ideological education for township cadres and agricultural cooperative cadres. At the same time, they took measures to strengthen market management, strictly stipulating that grain, cotton, oil, and other materials under state unified purchase and controlled purchase could only be freely sold by farmers after the unified purchase tasks had been completed. When agricultural cooperatives purchased large quantities of goods from supply and marketing cooperatives for their own use, they had to obtain a certificate from the township people's committee (proving that the members were for their own use) to prevent the occurrence of purchasing, trafficking, and opening shops for business. In areas where the commercial network is too sparse, state-owned commercial and supply and marketing departments are preparing to re-establish supply points. State-owned companies have also appropriately adjusted the excessively low purchase prices of a few commodities such as chickens, ducks, and eggs to encourage farmers to increase the production of small local products and by-products.

After the deviation of agricultural cooperatives engaging in business was corrected, the daily unified purchase of grain and oil by the state increased by half to one time compared to before, and the business of small traders gradually returned to normal. The shops and small shops opened by agricultural cooperatives are being gradually handed over to state-owned commercial and supply and marketing cooperatives for disposal.

    浠水纠正农民贸易中的偏向
    新华社武汉14日电　新华社记者陶锦琰报道：湖北省浠水县财经部门纠正农业社大量经营商业的偏向，引导农民开展正常的自由贸易。
    浠水县从8月份开辟国家领导下的自由市场以来，曾经发生农业社普遍从事商业的现象，有些农业社对商业的投资甚至比秋种冬播的生产投资还多。它们以巨额资金开设百货店、杂货店和小卖部，进货做买卖。许多乡干部和农业社干部对农民自由贸易的含义不明确，把经商当作改善社员生活的捷径，支持社员组织贩运小组，大量套购、贩运商品（包括国家统购物资），获取商业利润。这样便影响了国家对粮食、油料等物资的统购工作，小商小贩的营业额也因而下降。
    浠水县财经部门发现这些情况后，首先对乡干部和农业社干部进行政策思想教育，同时采取措施加强市场管理，严格规定粮食、棉花、油料等国家统购和掌握收购的物资，只有在统购、收购任务完成以后，才允许农民自由出售。农业社为了自用而向供销合作社批购大量商品时，必须取得乡人民委员会的证明（证明社员自用），以防止发生套购、贩运和开店营业等情况。商业网过于稀少的地区，国营商业和供销合作部门准备重新增设供应点。国营公司还把鸡、鸭、蛋等少数商品的过低的收购牌价，作了适当调整，鼓励农民增产小土产和副产品。
    农业社经商偏向得到纠正以后，国家每日统购粮食、油料的数量比这以前增加一半到一倍，小商小贩的营业也逐渐正常起来。农业社开设的店铺和小卖部正在陆续移交给国营商业和供销合作社处理。
