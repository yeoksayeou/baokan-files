    The Greater Khingan Mountains, rich and beautiful, are located in the northernmost part of the motherland, with a total area of over 9 million hectares and a timber reserve of 1 billion cubic meters. If this timber were made into railway sleepers, it could lay more than 3 million *li* of railway.

    The Greater Khingan Mountains are also rich in mineral deposits. Gold, iron, coal, fluorite, manganese, lead, molybdenum, and oil shale have already been discovered, and there may also be oil fields.

    In May of this year, more than 20 geological surveying teams and geophysical prospecting teams, jointly composed of Chinese and Soviet geologists and experts, conducted the first large-scale comprehensive geological survey and mineral prospecting in the Greater Khingan Mountains. In the future, aerial and the latest radioactive methods will be used to continue surveying and prospecting.

    In this dense forest, there are also many rare and exotic birds and animals, such as the Greater Khingan tiger, squirrels, deer, bears, lynx, otters, sables, and so on.

    The forest industry is an important part of the national economy. Timber can not only be used to build houses and make various tools and utensils, but also to make celluloid, gramophone records, artificial ivory, photographic film, cellophane, and wigs. Timber is also a raw material for making paper, rayon, and artificial wool. According to Soviet experts, one cubic meter of timber can produce 160 kilograms of rayon, which can be woven into 4,000 pairs of stockings or 600 sets of semi-silk fabrics. Artificial wool made from one cubic meter of timber is equivalent to the wool produced by about 30 sheep in a year.

    If timber is specially processed, it can be used as conduits to replace steel and cement. Soviet paper factories and chemical factories widely use timber as conduits, which is economical, convenient, and does not rust. The conduits used in the Volga-Don Canal lock built by the Soviet Union were made of wood, which saved hundreds of thousands of tons of metal.

    Acetone, formalin, methanol, alcohol, rubber, rosin, tung oil, camphor and other materials for industrial and medical use can also be extracted from timber. The larch bark abundant in the Greater Khingan Mountains can extract 11.5% of "tannin extract" per ton for tanned leather, and the remaining residue can be used as soundproofing boards and ceilings.

    The Greater Khingan Mountains forest area is the green treasure house of the motherland and the country's most important timber base. But in the past, the fate of this vast and rich forest was extremely tragic. Japanese imperialism carried out cruel and predatory management, which gradually made the green mountains and fields barren. It was not until after liberation that it regained its youth. Since 1953, forest tending and renewal work has been carried out, and dense and verdant young forests have gradually grown on barren mountains and ridges. By the end of this year, the Greater Khingan Mountains forest area will have completed the tending and renewal of 40,000 hectares of forest land, expanding the forest area by more than 13,000 hectares. Thanks to the efforts of forestry workers, new forest areas such as the Yituli River and Gen River have also been developed.

    In the past few years, the forest industry in the Greater Khingan Mountains has been transformed from backward handicraft production to mechanized and semi-mechanized production, and Soviet advanced experience has been promoted, and a series of production reforms have been implemented. In the first three years of the First Five-Year Plan, the timber production in the Greater Khingan Mountains forest area has exceeded the total output during the nine years of enemy and puppet rule. Among the timber transported, the sleepers alone can lay more than 1,460 kilometers of railway, and the general-purpose timber can build more than 7,978,800 square meters of houses.

    With the development of the national construction cause, the forest area has also shown a new look. In these places that were once uninhabited, there are now workers' new villages, schools, hospitals, sanatoriums, nurseries, cinemas, post offices, and department stores. A large-scale timber mill and a power plant have also appeared in the Arxan forest area. In the Yituli River, a mechanical repair plant has also been put into production. A factory for manufacturing extract from larch bark is being built intensively. Railways are constantly extending to the primeval forests. In recent years, railways have been built from Ers to Dahei, from Tangdu'er to Tuli River, and from Tuli River to Gen River. A forest railway from Tuli River to Ike River is also under construction. A new railway running through the Greater Khingan Mountains—the Nenjiang to Forest Area Line—has been preliminarily surveyed.

    At present, a upsurge of socialist competition has been set off in every corner of the forest area. Employees guarantee to complete the national plan according to material categories, practice strict economy, and not waste a single piece of the country's timber. (Attached picture)

    祖国绿色的宝库—大兴安岭
    牛俊山
    富饶而美丽的大兴安岭，位于祖国的最北面，总面积约九百多万公顷，蓄藏着十亿立方公尺木材。这些木材如制成枕木，可铺设铁路三百多万华里。
    大兴安岭的矿藏也很丰富。现在已经发现的有金、铁、煤、萤石、锰、铅、钼和油页岩，还可能有油田。
    今年5月，由中、苏地质工作者和专家合组成的二十多个地质测量队和地球物理探矿队在大兴安岭作了第一次大面积综合性的地质测量和普查找矿。今后还准备利用航空和最新的放射性方法，继续进行测量和探矿。
    在这个密林里，还有许多珍异的飞禽走兽，如兴安岭虎、灰鼠、鹿、熊、猞猁、水獭、紫貂等等。
    森林工业是国民经济的重要组成部分。木材不仅可以建筑房屋，制造各种工具、用具，而且可以用来制作赛璐珞、留声机唱片、人造象牙、照像机用胶片、玻璃纸和假头发等。木材又是造纸、人造丝、人造毛的原料。据苏联专家计算，一立方公尺的木材，可以制造一百六十公斤人造丝，这些丝可织成四千双长袜或六百套半丝织的衣料。一立方公尺木材制成的人造毛，约等于三十头羊一年所产的羊毛。
    木材如果经过特殊加工，可以作导管以代替钢铁和水泥。苏联的造纸工厂和化工工厂都广泛采用木材做导管，既经济、便利，又不生锈。苏联修建伏尔加—顿河运河水闸所用的导管，就是用木头制成的，由此节约了几十万吨金属。
    从木材里还能提炼出工业和医药上用的丙酮、福尔马林、甲醇、酒精、橡胶、松香、桐油、樟脑等物料。大兴安岭盛产的落叶松树皮，每吨可提炼出11.5％的熟皮子用的“单宁浸膏”，剩下来的渣子还可以作隔音板和天花板。
    大兴安岭林区是祖国的绿色宝库，是国家最重要的木材基地。但在过去，这辽阔、富饶的森林，命运是极其悲惨的。日本帝国主义进行残酷的、掠夺式的经营，使碧绿的山野日渐荒秃。直到解放以后，它才恢复了青春。从1953年起，进行了森林抚育更新工作，荒山秃岭又逐渐成长起了稠密、苍翠的幼林。到今年年底，大兴安岭林区将完成四万公顷林地的抚育更新工作，扩大森林面积一万三千多公顷。在林业工人的努力下，又开发了伊图里河、根河等新林区。
    几年来，大兴安岭的森林工业已由落后的手工业生产方式转变为机械化和半机械化的生产，并推广了苏联先进经验，实行了一系列的生产改革。在第一个五年计划的头三年里，大兴安岭林区的木材产量已经超过了敌伪统治时期九年产量的总和。在运出的木材中，单是枕木就可以铺设铁路一千四百六十多公里，一般用材可以建筑七百九十七万八千多平方公尺的房屋。
    随着国家建设事业的发展，林区也出现了新的面貌。在这些过去曾是渺无人迹的地方，出现了工人新村、学校、医院、疗养院、托儿所、电影院、邮局、百货公司。在阿尔山林区还出现了一座规模较大的制材厂和一座发电厂。在伊图里河，一座机械修配厂也投入了生产。用落叶松树皮制造浸膏的工厂正在加紧建设。一条条的铁路不断向原始森林伸展。几年来筑成了从伊尔斯到大黑，从唐都尔到图里河，从图里河到根河等铁路。从图里河到伊克河的一条森林铁路也正在紧张施工。纵贯大兴安岭的一条新铁路——嫩江到林区线，已初测完毕。
    目前，在林区的各个角落里，掀起了社会主义竞赛的热潮。职工们保证按材料类别完成国家计划，厉行节约，不浪费国家一根木材。（附图片）
