The Performance of "Mulian Saves His Mother"
Chen Shan

	Careful observation: The performance of "Mulian Saves His Mother," although containing many vivid and interesting interludes and the creation of ghosts, still leaves one feeling gloomy and dejected throughout the first half of the play, from "Descending Star" to the "Funeral Offering" after Fu Xiang's death, due to the dictates of the script. It evokes the darkness of the spiritual life of the old society, the power of theocratic rule, and can truly induce a mental state similar to that of Xianglin's Wife in her later years in "The New Year's Sacrifice"; one can feel the pressure of superstitious propaganda truly making it impossible to hold one's head high.

	However, the widespread popularity of "Mulian Saves His Mother" in the past is likely not for simple reasons. In order to propagate the idea that "good is rewarded with good, and evil with evil," the original work had to create the image of a so-called "evil person," which is the image of "Mulian's" mother, Liu Qingti. The original work fully depicted her "arrogance and boldness" – daring to go against her husband's will, betray her own vows, abolish all "good deeds," and resolutely eat meat. Moreover, this was no ordinary meat-eating, but "dog-meat eating," a "major transgression"; not only that, but she even used this dog-meat steamed bun to provide food to the monks, declaring her "severance from monks and Taoists," while burning scriptures and the temples and monasteries built by Fu Xiang during his lifetime, further publicly provoking the deities and monks.

	These actions were almost as if Sun Wukong were wreaking havoc in the heavenly palace, the epitome of "heterodoxy and rebellion."

	In this way, the author perhaps believed that such a person was fully qualified to be cast into the eighteenth level of hell to suffer, and could use this to achieve the purpose of "advising goodness"; but contrary to his expectations, he created for us a typical figure with extreme rebellious spirit: a typical rebel against feudal superstition and theocratic rule.

	Through the continuous processing and creation by the people, her rebellious character became even stronger, and the old operas even had performances of Liu Qingti destroying her husband's ancestral hall because she didn't believe in ghosts and gods.

	This made the second half of the play "Mulian Saves His Mother" shine with beautiful brilliance: a rebellious brilliance that liberated the people's spirits from the dark and heavy feudal superstition and the supreme theocratic rule.

	"Mulian" was determined to study the Tao in order to rescue his mother from hell. Since he was determined to rescue such a mother, it shows that he did not think his mother was deeply sinful; on the contrary, daring to rescue such a "rebel" from hell after experiencing all kinds of difficulties, he himself inherited this "rebellious" bloodline, I think. The appearance of such amazing plots in the second half of the "Mulian Saves His Mother" play, coupled with the appearance of the "Hanging Woman" and "Impermenance", makes it the essence of the whole play.

	Rural troupes raised a question to the Shanghai Lu Xun Memorial Committee and cultural circles: "Can the Mulian opera still be performed in the countryside in the future?" This question is very sharp and involves many things, so it is not easy to answer at once; the key lies in first adapting the script to see if its positive aspects of the theme can be highlighted. After several discussions with the troupe, it was decided to abandon the dross of propagating cause and effect in the first half and focus on the second half for preliminary reorganization; starting from the wavering of Liu's belief in "good deeds" such as eating vegetarian food and chanting Buddha after Fu Xiang's death, developing to smashing the mourning hall, eating meat, offering meat buns to monks, burning temples, burning scriptures, and severing ties with monks and Taoists; then falling into hell to suffer, Mulian going to learn the Tao to save his mother, and finally rescuing his mother. The "Hanging Man," "Hanging Woman," "Impermenance," and some interesting scenes from the first half were interspersed in the middle, and some unrelated plots such as "Chen Yuanjun Hanging Herself" were connected to the main story. Liu Qingti's unpopular "excessive actions" such as "demolishing bridges" and her embarrassing image of later turning into a dog were deleted. The ten scenes were initially arranged:

	1. Urging to Eat Meat, Sending Away the Son, 2. False Pretense, Giving Up Hairpins, 3. Hanging Man, Hanging Woman, 4. Eating Meat, Burning Temples (can include offering meat buns to monks, etc.), 5. Asking for a Doctor, Sending out the Sign, 6. Sun God, Capturing Liu, 7. Returning Souls, Luobu Learning the Tao, 8. Yearning for Home, Slippery Oil Mountain, 9. Touring the Halls, Searching for Mother (focusing on the Third, Sixth, and Tenth Halls), 10. Meeting Mother, Reunion.

	If necessary, a scene can also be added at the beginning, starting from Fu Xiang's deathbed, instructing his wife, to make the story clearer.

	With the support of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Culture, after hurried rehearsals, another performance was held on October 26, followed by a symposium. The peasant actors and writers had two different opinions. One opinion was that "Good people should go to heaven, and bad people should go to hell; Liu Qingti was originally a bad person, and she should suffer; now that she has become a good person, I am afraid the audience's thinking will not be clear; look, Mulian and she are walking two different paths. If Liu Qingti is treated as a good person, this is not called the Mulian opera, it becomes a play against superstition and theocratic rule." Another opinion was: "If this is not the Mulian opera, what is it called? Is it bad to oppose superstition and theocratic rule? We are also against these now, are we all bad people?"

	I insisted on my opinion, believing that Liu Qingti is a Sun Wukong-type character. For thousands of years, the Chinese people have both accepted the profound influence of superstition and theocratic rule, and also felt the great pressure of this influence. There are latent elements of rebellion in their spirit. In this play, the peasants unleash it: creatively developing typical characters such as Liu Qingti and Mulian, which is the inherent reason why peasants love to watch this play. Therefore, while writing about a typical figure like "Xianglin's Wife" who feels that her soul is about to be split in half by ghosts and gods, Mr. Lu Xun also proudly mentioned in his article ("The Hanging Woman") that when he was in his teens, he climbed onto the stage to "explain his aspirations," acting as the "righteous ghost" in the "Mulian" play, receiving a steel hairpin, painting several strokes of color on his face, and following the actors to the cemetery to "start the mourning," inviting the ghosts to watch the play.

	According to Mr. Lu Xun, "starting the mourning" means summoning the ghosts of those who died violently; "Ming society is about to perish, and many Yue people rose up and died for righteousness. In the Qing Dynasty, they were called rebels, and we treated their heroic spirits in the same way." [Note]

	When we commemorate Mr. Lu Xun, we must not forget that he was a rebel against the dark system and dark spirit of the old society, and his articles are also full of praise for many people with a rebellious spirit.

	Above, I have written out my views on this play and related suggestions for modification. I hope to receive guidance on whether it is appropriate. (To be continued)

### “目连救母”的演出

    “目连救母”的演出
    陈山
    仔细观察：“目连救母”的演出，虽然其中有许多生动有趣的插曲和鬼魂的创造，但由于剧本的决定，整个戏剧的前半部，即是从
  “降星”起一直到傅相死后的“成服施食”为止，却仍旧使人感到阴沉和颓丧，感到旧社会精神生活的幽暗，感到神权统治的强大，真使人会产生像“祝福”中祥林嫂晚年那样的精神状态；人们可以感到迷信宣传的压力真会使人抬不起头来。
    可是，“目连救母”过去在民间广泛流传，它的原因恐怕并不简单。原作为了达到宣扬“善有善报，恶有恶报”的思想，不得不创造了所谓“恶人”的形象，这就是“目连”的母亲刘青提的形象。原作写尽了她的“狂妄大胆”——竟敢对丈夫的遗嘱一反其道而行，背弃自己的盟誓，废除一切“善行”，决然开荤，而且这个开荤不同寻常，竟是“杀狗开荤”，是开的“大荤”；非但如此，她还索性用这种狗肉馒头斋僧，表示和“僧道绝缘”，一面烧毁经卷和傅相生前建造的寺观，进一步公开激怒神道与和尚。
    这些所作所为，简直和孙悟空大闹天宫差不多，是“离经叛道”之尤者。
    这样，作者或许认定这样的人已经完全有资格打落十八层地狱受苦了，就可以借此来达到“劝善”的目的；但出乎他的意料之外，他却给我们创造了这样一个带有极端叛逆精神的典型：一个对封建迷信和神权统治的叛逆者的典型。
    经过民间的不断加工创造，使她的叛逆性格更加强烈，旧戏里甚至有刘青提由于不信鬼神而打毁丈夫祭堂的演出。
    这就使“目连救母”一剧的后半部闪耀出了美丽的光彩：从黑暗重重的封建迷信和至高无上的神权统治下使人民的精神解放出来的叛逆性光彩。
    “目连”是为了从地狱里救出母亲才立志学道的，他既然决心救出这样的母亲，可见他并不认为母亲是罪孽深重的；反之，敢于历尽困难从地狱中救出这样的“叛逆者”，那他本身也就继承了这种“叛逆”的血统，我以为。“目连救母”戏的后半部出现了这样惊人的情节，加上“女吊”、“无常”都出现在后半部，这就使它成为全剧的精华所在。
    农村剧团向上海的鲁迅纪念委员会和文化界提出了一个问题：“目连戏以后可不可以在乡间演出？”这个问题很尖锐，牵涉到的东西很多，一下子不好回答；关键在于首先改编剧本，看看是否能突出它的积极方面的主题。经过和剧团方面几次的商讨，决定舍弃前半部宣扬因果报应的糟粕，以后半部为主，进行了极初步的整理；从傅相死后，刘氏对吃素念佛这一类的“善行”的信念发生动摇开始，发展到打孝堂、开荤、肉馒头斋僧、烧庵、烧经卷，和僧道断绝往来等；然后就是落地狱受苦，目连为救母而去学道，终至救出母亲为止。把“男吊”、“女吊”、“无常”和前半部某些有趣的场面穿插在中间，把一些不相关联的情节如“陈院君上吊”等和主要故事串联起来。删去刘青提“拆桥”等不得人心的“过火行动”和她后来变狗等难堪形象。初步排定十场：
    1、劝荤、遣子，2、出骗、舍钗，3、男吊、女吊，4、开荤、烧庵（可包括肉馒头斋僧等），5、请医、发牌，6、日神、捉刘氏，7、回煞、罗卜学道，8、望乡、滑油山，9、游殿、寻母（重点在三、六、十殿），10、遇母、团圆。
    必要时，也可在前面加上一场，从傅相临终，遗嘱妻子开始，使故事的眉目更清楚一点。
    在上海市文化局的支助下，经过匆促的排演，在10月26日再演出了一场，接着开了一个座谈会。农民演员和作家分两类意见。一种认为，“好人应该上天堂，坏人应该落地狱；刘青提本来是坏人，应该受苦才对，现在变了好人，只怕观众思想打不通；试看，目连和她走的就是两条路。如把刘青提当好人看待，这就不叫目连戏了，变成了反对迷信和神权的戏。”一种意见认为：“这不是目连戏又叫做什么戏呢？反对迷信和神权不好吗？现在我们对这些也反对，难道我们都是坏人？”
    我坚持了我的意见，认为刘青提是个孙悟空类型的人物，千百年来，中国人民一方面接受了迷信、神权的深刻影响，而一方面也感到这种压力的重大，精神上有反叛的因素潜在着，在这个戏上农民就把它发作出来：创造性地发展了刘青提和目连这样的典型，这才是农民爱看这个戏的内在原因。所以鲁迅先生在写出了“祥林嫂”这样的感到自己的灵魂将被鬼神劈成两半的典型的同时，也在文章（“女吊”）中得意地提到他十余岁的时候，曾经自己爬上台去“说明志愿”，充当了“目连”戏中的“义勇鬼”，领到一柄钢钗，脸上涂好几笔彩色，跟着演员到坟地里去“起殇”，邀请厉鬼来看戏的事。
    据鲁迅先生说：“起殇”就是召集横死者的鬼魂的意思；“明社垂绝，越人起义而死者不少，至清被称为叛贼，我们就这样的一同招待他们的英灵。”〔注〕
    我们纪念鲁迅先生，就不能忘记他是旧社会的黑暗制度和黑暗精神的叛逆者，他的文章中也充满着对许多有叛逆精神者的赞美。
    上面我写出了我对这个戏的看法以及有关修改的意见，是否妥当，希望得到指正。　　　（续完）
