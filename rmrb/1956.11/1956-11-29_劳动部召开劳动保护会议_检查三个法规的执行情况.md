The Ministry of Labor Convenes a Labor Protection Conference to Inspect the Implementation of Three Regulations

(Our Newspaper) Recently, the Ministry of Labor convened a labor protection conference. At the meeting, fourteen provinces and cities and twenty-four industrial departments reported on the implementation of the "Regulations on Factory Safety and Hygiene," "Safety Technology for Building and Installation Projects," and "Regulations on Reporting Work-Related Injuries and Deaths." In the past few months, the People's Committees of various provinces and cities and most industrial departments have convened meetings and made arrangements based on these three regulations. Most regions have adopted a method of learning and inspecting simultaneously. Hebei, Tangshan, Shenyang, and the First Ministry of Machine Building and the Ministry of Electrical Machinery are nearing the end of their learning and inspection phases. In Beijing, 569 units have conducted learning sessions, with 347 units currently undergoing inspections.

During the learning and inspection process, enterprise leaders have greatly enhanced their sense of responsibility for safety and hygiene work. The head of the Labor and Wage Section of the Tianjin Vehicle Spring Factory said, "In the future, we must consider the health of workers when arranging work." Some engineering and technical personnel stated that in engineering design, they will consider both economic benefits and the safety and health of workers.

Many enterprises have reported the problems identified during the inspection to the masses, prioritizing them according to their importance and urgency. Problems that can be solved immediately are being addressed; those that cannot be solved are generally included in the 1957 safety technology measures plan, technical organization measures plan, and capital construction for resolution; those that cannot be resolved next year will be included in long-term plans for gradual resolution.

In addition, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry system held labor protection conferences in Central South, Northeast, Tianjin, and Beijing, focusing on exchanging experiences in preventing silicosis hazards. In the mining sector, comprehensive measures such as wet drilling, wetting agents, mechanical ventilation, sprayers, and breathing exercises have been adopted. In some mines, the concentration of silica dust has approached the national standard.

The current shortcomings in implementing the regulations are that some enterprise leaders do not have a comprehensive understanding of its implementation. For example, some only issued notices without organizing cadres to seriously study, publicize to the masses, or mobilize the masses to conduct inspections; others believe it is a crash task and want to meet the requirements of the regulations within a few days, resulting in impatience. The comrades present at the meeting believed that the correct approach should be: concentrating efforts on learning and inspection for a certain period is necessary, but to fully achieve the standards required by the regulations, different requirements should be proposed based on different conditions and gradually resolved.

### 劳动部召开劳动保护会议  检查三个法规的执行情况

    劳动部召开劳动保护会议
    检查三个法规的执行情况
    本报讯　最近劳动部召开了劳动保护会议，会上，十四个省市和二十四个产业部门汇报了有关工厂安全卫生、建筑安装工程安全技术和伤亡事故报告等三个规程执行的情况。几个月来，各省市人民委员会和大部分产业部门都根据这三个法规，先后召开了会议，作了布置。大部分地区采取边学习边检查的办法。河北、唐山、沈阳和第一机械工业部、电机部学习和检查将告一段落。北京市有五百六十九个单位进行了学习，其中有三百四十七个单位正在进行检查。
    在学习和检查中企业领导干部大大提高了安全卫生工作的责任感。天津车辆弹簧厂劳动工资科长说：“今后在安排工作时一定考虑到工人的健康”。有些工程技术人员表示，在工程设计时，既考虑到经济效果，又要考虑到工人的安全和健康。
    不少企业单位对检查出来的问题，都分别轻重缓急，向群众作了交代。能够解决的立即着手解决；不能解决的一般都分别列入1957年安全技术措施计划、技术组织措施计划和基本建设中加以解决；明年不能解决的，则订出长期规划逐步加以解决。
    另外，冶金工业部系统分别在中南、东北、天津、北京召开了劳动保护会议，着重交流防止矽尘危害的经验，矿山方面采取湿式凿岩、湿润剂、机械通风、喷雾器及呼吸体操等综合性措施，有些矿山的矽尘浓度已能接近国家规定的标准。
    在贯彻规程上目前存在的缺点是有些企业领导干部对贯彻这一规程认识不全面。如有的只发了通知没有组织干部认真学习、向群众进行宣传、发动群众进行检查；有的认为是一个突击任务，想在几天之内达到规程的要求，产生了急躁情绪。到会同志认为正确的作法应该是：在目前一定时期集中力量进行学习检查是必要的，但彻底实现规程要求的标准，应该分别不同条件提出不同的要求，逐步解决。
