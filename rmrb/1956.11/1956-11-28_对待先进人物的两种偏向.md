    Two Deviations in Treating Advanced Individuals
　　Mao Xianzhi
    In Dalian-Lushun Municipality, some enterprises exhibit two deviations in the cultivation and utilization of advanced individuals.
    One is that after advanced individuals are selected, insufficient attention is paid to continuing to cultivate and educate them to create greater production achievements. Instead, they are excessively engaged in “high profile” activities, excessively holding various positions, and attending meetings and giving reports everywhere, resulting in advanced individuals being separated from production for extended periods. For example, Lu Shenghe, a first-class labor model in Dalian-Lushun Municipality, also serves as a member of the Dalian-Lushun Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, a member of the Dalian-Lushun Municipal Committee of the First Machine Trade Union, a representative of the People’s Congress of Shahekou District, a member of the workshop Party branch committee, a member of the workshop rationalization proposal committee, and a production team leader. To attend various meetings, give reports, and receive visitors, he spent sixty-seven working days in the first half of this year alone. Ma Jinhua, a special-class labor model in Dalian-Lushun Municipality, actually participated in production for only over ninety days in the first eight months of this year, so her production performance has fallen behind that of ordinary workers. This situation often makes it difficult for many advanced individuals to complete their own production and work tasks. Hou Yufeng, a special-class labor model in Dalian-Lushun Municipality, holds six positions concurrently. The saleswoman of her team only assigned her half of the task in April to accommodate her going out to handle “diplomacy.” Labor model Lu Shenghe was barely rated as an advanced producer in the factory for the first half of this year because he spent little time in actual production due to attending meetings. The situation worsened in July and August. In July, he only completed 78% of his production task, and in August, he only completed 61% of his production task. He was not rated as a winner in the competition for two consecutive months.
    Multiple concurrent positions and numerous meetings also affect their cultural and technical studies. Lu Shenghe began studying at an amateur middle school last spring. Those who started studying with him have now advanced to the second year, but Lu Shenghe had to start from the first year again because he frequently went out to attend meetings. Wang Yuji, a special-class labor model in the city, was originally a model student, but his studies have deteriorated in recent years. Excessive concurrent positions and other social activities not only prevent advanced individuals from working, studying, and resting normally, but also hinder their physical health.
    The result of this approach is that when Dalian-Lushun Municipality selected municipal-level labor models for 1955 this year, twenty-six labor models from 1954 were not selected due to a lack of new achievements. Some others were not selected because they lacked education and became arrogant and complacent ideologically.
    The other deviation in treating advanced individuals is to idolize them. Some people believe that advanced individuals should be good at everything and that their shortcomings should not be publicly criticized. The sand casting workshop of the Dalian Machine Tool Plant has indeed made great achievements in production, so the factory trade union wanted to cultivate this workshop into a model. However, the workshop's situation of working overtime was very serious, and the Dalian-Lushun Daily criticized this matter. At this time, the chairman of the Dalian Machine Tool Plant's trade union was very dissatisfied, believing that this was a blow to the workshop. The Dalian Shipyard's Machinery Plant treats advanced workers differently from ordinary workers. When ordinary workers produce defective products, they write self-criticisms, and the leaders criticize them. However, when advanced individuals produce defective products, the leading cadres remain silent, secretly obtain some raw materials, and make a replacement to finish the job. This unfair treatment makes the surrounding workers very dissatisfied, creating a gap between advanced workers and ordinary workers, and affecting the workers' unity.
    Even worse, some people are only satisfied with the existing few advanced individuals and do not see the rising stars. When the production performance of many workers exceeds or approaches the advanced level, they remain silent, do not summarize, and do not promote them, fearing that these people's production performance will surpass that of the original advanced individuals. Therefore, they are unwilling to recognize new advanced individuals. The result of doing so hinders the continuous emergence of new advanced individuals and obstructs the continuous development of the advanced producer movement.

    对待先进人物的两种偏向
　　毛先智
    旅大市的部分企业，在对待先进人物的培养、使用方面，有两种偏向。
    一种是：先进人物评选出来之后，不注意继续培养教育他们创造更大的生产成绩，而使他们去过多地干一些“出头露面”的事情，过多地兼任各种职务，到处开会作报告，结果先进人物长期脱离生产。如旅大市一等劳动模范卢盛和，就兼任青年团旅大市委委员、第一机械工会旅大市委员会委员、沙河口区人民代表、车间党支部委员会委员、车间合理化建议委员会委员、生产小组长等职。他为了参加各种会议、作报告、接待来访等，光是今年上半年，就占去了六十七个工作日。旅大市特等劳动模范马金花，在今年的头八个月里，实际参加生产不过九十多天，因此生产成绩已经落在一般工人的后边了。这种情况，使得许多先进人物经常完不成自己的生产和工作任务。旅大市特等劳动模范侯玉凤身兼六职，小组的营业员为了照顾她出去办“外交”，四月份只给她一半的任务。劳动模范卢盛和在今年上半年就因为外出开会，实际从事生产的时间不多，勉强被评为工厂上半年的先进生产者；七、八月份的情况更坏了，七月份只完成生产任务78％，八月份只完成生产任务61％，连续两个月没有被评上竞赛优胜者。
    兼职多和会议多，还影响了他们的文化技术学习。卢盛和去年春天就参加业余中学学习，和他一起参加学习的人现在已经升入二年级了，而卢盛和因为经常外出开会，不得不又从一年级开始学习。市特等劳动模范王玉吉原是一个学习模范，但是近年来他的学习情况不好了。过多的兼职和其它的社会活动，不但使得先进人物不能正常地工作、学习和休息，而且也妨碍了他们的身体健康。
    这种做法的结果是：今年旅大市在评选1955年市级劳动模范的时候，就有二十六名1954年度的劳动模范因没有新的成绩而未被评上，还有一些人因缺乏教育，思想上产生了骄傲自满而落选了。
    对待先进人物的另一种偏向是：把先进人物偶像化。有些人认为先进人物应该什么都好，不能对他们的缺点进行公开批评。大连机床厂翻砂车间的生产确有很大的成绩，因此工厂工会想把这个车间培养成一个典型。但是这个车间加班加点的情况很严重，旅大日报对此事提出了批评。这时，大连机床厂工会主席就大为不满，认为这是对这个车间的一种打击。大连造船公司机械厂，对待先进工人和对待普通工人，有着两种不同的待遇。当一般工人出了废品时，个人写检讨，领导上批评。而先进人物出了废品，领导干部却不声不响，私下弄点原材料，补做一个就完了。这种不公平的待遇，使得周围的工人很不满，以致在先进工人和普通工人之间造成了隔阂，影响了工人的团结。
    更不好的，是有些人只满足于已有的几个先进人物，看不到后起之秀。当许多工人的生产成绩超过或是接近先进水平的时候，他们不声不响，不总结，不推广，怕这些人的生产成绩压过了原来的先进人物，因此不肯承认新的先进人物。这样做的结果就妨碍了新的先进人物的不断出现，阻碍了先进生产者运动不断的发展。
