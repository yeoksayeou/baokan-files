    National Unity Saved Bai Mingxuan's Life
    Ma Taosheng
    On the evening of September 2nd, the National United Agricultural Cooperative of Sheli Township, Fourth District, Horqin Left Wing Rear Banner, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, was preparing to hold a meeting of members to discuss autumn harvest work. After dinner, members arrived at the meeting place one after another, and the meeting was about to begin. Suddenly, someone ran in and said, "Comrade Bai Mingxuan (a Mongolian member) is sick, very sick." The members were very anxious when they heard this and discussed, "Hurry up and get a doctor!" "What if we don't have money? Besides, there are no doctors nearby. It takes twenty or thirty li to invite one. Will they come in the dark of night?"
    Cooperative Director Pu Yuxi (Korean ethnicity) was more anxious than others. When he arrived at Bai Mingxuan's home, the small house was crowded with people. The patient had a high fever of 41.7 degrees Celsius and was already unconscious. He immediately decided to call a doctor first; then he sent two people on horseback to the district health center, twenty-five li away, to invite a doctor.
    When Doctor Zheng from the district health center arrived, it was already midnight. After twelve hours of injections and emergency treatment, the patient's temperature dropped to 40.7 degrees Celsius, but his life was still in danger, and Doctor Zheng was at a loss. Bai Mingxuan's family asked the cooperative director to find a way to borrow some money to prepare for the funeral. The cooperative director thought that as long as there was a glimmer of hope, he should try his best to treat him, so he discussed with the patient's family and decided to send him to Siping City, Jilin Province, for treatment. The members jointly raised more than sixty yuan as medical expenses, and four Korean members and the cooperative director voluntarily offered to take the patient.
    Upon arriving in Siping, they went to several hospitals, but the doctors saw that the illness was serious and could not be cured, so they refused to admit him. The cooperative director then decided to send the patient to Changchun for treatment, and finally admitted him to the hospital of the Military Medical University.
    After returning home, the cooperative director tried to raise more than one hundred yuan and sent it to the patient.
    Five days later, Bai Changshan, a member who sent Bai Mingxuan to Changchun for treatment, returned from the hospital and said that after treatment, the patient could eat and drink, and could also get up and move around. He would be discharged from the hospital in a few days.
    This matter spread throughout the township, and everyone said: If it weren't for the Communist Party and Chairman Mao leading us to take the road of cooperativization, and if it weren't for the close unity and mutual assistance of all ethnic groups, if Bai Mingxuan had such a serious illness, how could he have had the strength to go to Changchun for treatment?

    民族团结挽救了白明铉的生命
    马套生
    9月2日的晚上，内蒙古自治区科尔沁左翼后旗四区舍力乡民族联合农业社，准备开社员大会，研究秋收工作。晚饭后，社员们陆续来到了会场，大会就要开始了。突然有个人跑进来说：“白明铉同志（蒙古族社员）病了，病得很厉害。”社员们听了都非常焦急，议论着说：“赶快请医生看呀！”“没有钱怎么办？再说附近也没有医生，要到二、三十里地去请，黑更半夜，人家是不是能来呢？”
    社主任朴禹喜同志（朝鲜族）比别人更着急，他赶到白明铉家里时，小屋子里挤满了人，病人发高烧到四十一点七度，已经不省人事了。他马上决定先请医生看；随即打发两个人骑着马到二十五里外的区卫生所去请医生。
    区卫生所的郑医生赶到时，已经是深夜十二点。经过十二个小时的打针急救，病人的体温下降到四十点七度，生命仍很危险，郑医生也束手无策了。白明铉的家属要求社主任想办法借几个钱预备后事。社主任想，只要有一线希望，还应该尽量救治，就同病人的家属商量好送到附近的吉林省四平市去治疗，社员又共同凑了六十多元作为治疗费，四个朝鲜族社员和社主任都自动愿意去送病人。
    到四平，走了几个医院，医生看病情严重，无法救治，都不收留。社主任又决定把病人赶送到长春去治疗，最后送进了军医大学的医院。
    社主任回到家里又设法筹措了一百多元钱给病人寄去。
    五天以后，送白明铉去长春治病的社员白长山从医院回来说，病人经过治疗，已经能吃能喝，也能起来活动，再有些天就可以病好出院了。
    这件事传遍了全乡，大家说：要不是共产党、毛主席领导咱们走合作化的道路，要不是各民族的亲密团结和互相帮助，白明铉得这样重的病，哪有力量到长春去治疗呢？
