    Don't Let岫岩 Jade Products Be Lost

    The jade products produced in Xiuyan County, Liaoning Province, have long enjoyed a reputation. It is said that they have a history of nearly four hundred years. There are many types of Xiuyan jade, including green jasper, crystal-like white jade, agate-like red jade, as well as iridescent mixed jade and landscape jade with natural scenes... Among them, the best is "Ju Yu," or "Old Jade." Jade craftsmen use grinding wheels and knives to carve jade into various exquisite and beautiful daily utensils and works of art. Common items include jade cups and pots for drinking, bowls, chopsticks, plates, and saucers for eating, and decorative rings, jade bracelets, lions, monkeys, frogs, and hand stamps, totaling more than a thousand varieties. Xiuyan jade is not only beautiful but also has the characteristics of being warm in winter and cool in summer, wear-resistant, soft, rust-free, and corrosion-resistant. During the Qing Dynasty, there were as many as two hundred jade craftsmen in Xiuyan.

    During the Kuomintang rule, a large number of Xiuyan jade craftsmen lost their jobs, and the production of Xiuyan jade products was once suspended. After liberation, it has not been well restored. Now there are only nine old workers and no new apprentices. Production is sluggish, and the variety of products is monotonous. They can only be sold sporadically and in small quantities, and cannot be produced on a large scale. Is it the lack of sales of Xiuyan jade products that caused this sluggish situation? No. People from cities such as Jilin, Changchun, Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai have come to request orders, but the relevant departments have not seriously organized production, thus affecting the development of Xiuyan jade industry and the lives of workers. Some old workers said: "This industry is almost over. The work is tiring, the pay is low, and no young people want to do it. The government does not advocate or help. When the few of us die, the Xiuyan jade industry will be lost."

    We want to appeal: save the Xiuyan jade industry, and do not let the centuries-old and richly colorful Xiuyan jade products die in our generation's hands.

### 莫让岫岩玉制品失传

    莫让岫岩玉制品失传
    辽宁省岫岩县出产的玉制品向负盛誉，据说距今已有近四百年的历史。岫岩玉的种类很多，有绿色的碧玉、水晶般的白玉、玛瑙般的赤玉，也有五光十色的混合玉和生有自然景象的山水风景玉……其中最好的是“咀玉”，即“老玉”。玉业工人用轮磨和刀子，把玉雕刻成各种精致美观的日用器皿和艺术品，常见的有喝酒用的玉石杯、壶，吃饭用的碗、筷、盘、碟，装饰用的戒指、玉镯、狮、猴、蛙以及手戳等一千多种。岫岩玉不仅美丽，而且富有冬暖夏凉，抗磨、软、不生锈、不腐蚀等特点。清朝的时候，岫岩玉业工人曾多达二百余人。
    国民党统治时期，岫岩玉业工人大批失业，岫岩玉制品曾一度停业生产，解放后一直没有很好地恢复，现在仅有老工人九名，一个新徒工也没有。生产萧条，产品种类单调，只能零星小卖，不能大宗生产。是不是岫岩玉制品没有销路才造成这种萧条的局面呢？不是的。吉林、长春、北京、天津、上海等城市都有人来要求订货，但有关部门并没有认真组织生产，因而影响了岫岩玉业的发展和工人生活。有的老工人说：“这一行算不行了，工作累，待遇低，青年人谁都不干，政府也不提倡和帮助。我们这几个人死了，岫岩玉业就要失传了。
    我们要呼吁：救救岫岩玉业，不要让有着数百年历史的、丰富多采的岫岩玉制品在我们这一代的手中死亡。
