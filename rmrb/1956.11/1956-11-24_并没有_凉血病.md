    There is No Such Thing as "Blood-Cooling Disease"
    In the editorial "Helping the Masses Develop Traditional Chinese Medicine Production" in your newspaper on October 27th, it was stated: "Rehmannia glutinosa, which has obvious curative effects for treating diseases such as blood-cooling, has been out of stock for a long time." Rehmannia glutinosa does indeed have the effect of "cooling blood," but "cooling blood" is the pharmacological property of Rehmannia glutinosa, not a disease name. Neither Chinese nor Western medicine has the term "blood-cooling disease." The editorial also stated: "For example, stiff silkworms and centipedes are harmful to humans and animals." We know that the traditional Chinese medicine stiff silkworm is a diseased and dead silkworm. I don't know what it refers to when it is said that it will harm humans and animals.

### 并没有“凉血病”

    并没有“凉血病”
    10月27日你报社论“帮助群众发展中药生产”中说：“治凉血等病症有明显疗效的生地黄已长期脱销”。生地黄确具有“凉血”的作用，但是，“凉血”是生地黄的药理性能，并不是一种病名。无论中西医学都没有“凉血病”这个名词。社论中还说：“例如，僵蚕、蜈蚣都是危害人畜的”。我们知道，中药的僵蚕是病死的蚕，说它会危害人畜，不知是指什么而说的。（济南　时立翰）
