    The Cherished and Respectable Image of Mr. Sun Yat-sen in the Minds of the Chinese People
    Huang Yanpei
    The first time I saw Mr. Sun Yat-sen was in Zhang Garden in Shanghai. I participated in listening to Mr. Sun Yat-sen's speech among the masses. I can't remember the year, but the majestic aura of Mr. Sun Yat-sen, supporting himself with a cane, remains vivid in my mind.

    I was a member of the Chinese Revolutionary Alliance led by Mr. Sun Yat-sen. In the winter of 1905, I formally recited the oath in Shanghai – "Drive out the Tartars, restore China, establish the Republic, and equalize land ownership" – and joined the alliance. Before this, several revolutionary groups were regional in nature. The Revolutionary Alliance was national. The full name was the "Chinese Revolutionary Alliance". At that time, to avoid being conspicuous and for the sake of secrecy, it was generally called the "Revolutionary Alliance". After joining, I served as a Shanghai officer, responsible for managing a large number of party member lists, codes, telegram ciphers, and handling secret reception and transportation of party members passing through Shanghai. In this process, I met some new friends, including Liao Zhongkai, whom I met at this time. However, in 1906, when Mr. Sun Yat-sen passed through Shanghai, he secretly asked me to meet him on a large ship outside the Wusongkou through a Frenchman in the concession, but unfortunately, a malfunction occurred, and I did not get to see him.

    I participated in the Xinhai Revolution, but only in the local revolutionary work in Jiangsu and Shanghai. At that time, I gathered a large group of enthusiastic young revolutionary comrades. Every evening, we gathered in the "Xi Lou," a small building in the Shanghai Shibao (the most progressive newspaper) on Wangping Street; we also often gathered at Zhao Zhujun's house on Nanyang Road to exchange information and plan work. However, among this large group of people, only Chen Taoyi and I were members of the Revolutionary Alliance. When the news of the Wuchang Uprising reached Shanghai, provinces successively responded with declarations of independence. Wangping Street was a concentration of newspaper offices, and telegrams were posted outside every glass window. Every night, the masses were packed with people, all seeking news. When a victory report arrived, they applauded and cheered; if a telegram reported a defeat, the masses suspected that the newspaper was instructed by the Qing court to falsely report victory as defeat, and the doors and windows would be smashed. The newspaper offices dared not report failures again. The whole country was filled with declarations of independence, and the Qing court was shocked. On the thirteenth day of the ninth month (lunar calendar), the Shanghai Zhabei Chamber of Commerce launched an uprising, and the entire city was covered in white flags. The Shanghai Military Government was established. On the fifteenth, I was recommended by the five regions of Suzhou, Changzhou, Songjiang, Zhenjiang, and Taicang to go to Suzhou to persuade the Jiangsu Governor Cheng Dequan to launch an uprising. Cheng Dequan had already telegraphed several governors with relatively progressive ideas, requesting that they jointly ask the Qing Emperor to abdicate. When I arrived in Suzhou, the entire city was already covered in white flags. Cheng Dequan was then publicly elected as governor, and I stayed in Suzhou to handle affairs. At that time, Nanjing was still held by Qing troops, and Cheng Dequan, in conjunction with the troops of various provinces, recovered it and moved the government to Nanjing, greatly boosting the morale of the army and the people. However, serious internal strife occurred within the party. Tao Chengzhang, a leader of a unit within the Revolutionary Alliance, was assassinated by Chiang Kai-shek, who was dispatched by Chen Qimei, the governor of Shanghai. On November 4th, Mr. Sun Yat-sen returned to China and arrived in Shanghai. On the 11th, the Provisional Senate in Nanjing elected him as the Provisional President of the Republic of China. He took office on the 13th, changing that day to January 1st of the first year of the Republic of China. On February 12th, the Qing Emperor Puyi abdicated, and on the 13th, Mr. Sun Yat-sen resigned from the presidency to the Provisional Senate, and Yuan Shikai succeeded him.

    After the establishment of the Republic of China, the Revolutionary Alliance was reorganized into the Kuomintang, but I did not participate.

    In 1913, after the failure of the Second Revolution, I soon resigned from my position as Director of Education of Jiangsu Province.

    The traitorous Yuan Shikai died not long after. After many upheavals in the political scene, Mr. Sun Yat-sen returned to Shanghai. In 1920, he summoned me to show me his handwritten first draft of "Doing is Easy, Knowing is Difficult" – later named *Sun Wen's Doctrine* – to solicit opinions. I replied: "I have always read in old books that 'Knowing is not difficult, doing is difficult.' Now you have established a new meaning. Let me read it carefully." He then kept me and his wife for lunch. Later, I also received a signed first edition from Mr. Sun Yat-sen.

    In 1922, Mr. Sun Yat-sen summoned me again. At that time, Chen Jiongming had rebelled, and Mr. Sun Yat-sen had escaped and returned to Shanghai. He asked me what my opinion was on the future. I replied: "Mr. Sun Yat-sen originally had a plan to travel around the country, and you have already traveled to some areas. Continue to do so in the future, so that the people of the whole country will stand up and more universally and intimately accept your correct leadership. Any traitor will only bring about his own destruction." Mr. Sun Yat-sen replied: "The problem lies in imperialist aggression. The enemies are pressing closer step by step, not allowing us to prepare calmly." He also very intimately kept me and his wife for dinner.

    At that time, I had been working at the Shanghai Shenbao (newspaper) for a long time. Mr. Sun Yat-sen wrote a large article, "The Chinese Revolution," for the Shenbao commemorative album "The Most Recent 50 Years" that I was responsible for editing.

    At that time, the whole world was influenced by the October Socialist Revolution of 1917. In 1921, Lenin sent Martin to the East to seek friends. In Beijing, he met Li Dazhao, who introduced Martin to Mr. Sun Yat-sen in the South. They had a very cordial conversation, and Martin suggested two things: (1) building a party; (2) building an army. Mr. Sun Yat-sen requested assistance from the Soviet Union. Later, the Soviet Union sent Joffe and Borodin, one after the other, to assist in building the party and building the army, respectively.

    In 1923, Mr. Sun Yat-sen published the Declaration of Reorganization of the Chinese Kuomintang, establishing the three major policies of alliance with Russia, alliance with the Communist Party, and assistance to peasants and workers.

    Unfortunately, Mr. Sun Yat-sen passed away in 1925. His will stated, "... we must awaken the masses and unite with the nations of the world that treat us equally to fight together..." Finally, he also shouted: "Peace, struggle, save China!"

    Isn't everything enough for us successors to deeply commemorate forever!

    I would also like to mention in passing: In January 1906, the second issue of the Revolutionary Alliance's official newspaper, *Min Bao*, introduced the life of Marx and Engels, and also introduced the *Communist Manifesto*. It has been fifty years now.

    The Chinese people have long been liberated, the People's Republic of China has long been established, and the Chinese people are constantly remembering the great Mr. Sun Yat-sen.

    中国人民脑海中留着这样一个可爱可敬的孙中山先生遗影
    黄炎培
    我第一次见孙中山先生，是在上海张园，我参加在群众中听先生演说。年月已记不起，但先生支着一条手杖，雄伟的气概，我脑海里至今没有模糊。
    我是中山先生领导的中国同盟会会员。1905年冬天在上海正式宣读誓词——驱除鞑虏，恢复中华，建立民国，平均地权。——而入会的。在这以前，若干革命团体是带地方性的。同盟会是全国性的了。全名是“中国革命同盟会”当时为了避免刺目，便于秘密，一般称“同盟会”，我入会后担任的是上海干事，掌握大批党员名单暗号、电报密码，并负责党员过上海秘密招待接送事务，在这中间认识了一些新朋友，廖仲恺就是这时候结识的一人。但1906年中山先生过上海，通过租界法国人秘密招我去吴淞口外大轮船上接谈，不料发生故障，竟不获见。
    辛亥革命工作，我是参加的，但只参加江苏和上海地方性的革命工作。那时我结合了一大群热心革命的青壮年同志，每晚在上海望平街时报馆——最进步的报纸——小楼名“息楼”相聚；又常集中南阳路赵竹君家互报消息，策划工作。但这一大群人中，同盟会员只有我和陈陶遗两人。武昌起义消息到上海，各省先后响应独立，望平街是报馆集中地，家家玻璃窗外张贴电报，每夜群众挤得满满，都是探听消息，一个捷报到来，鼓掌狂欢；一电失败，群众疑这家报馆受清廷指使，诬胜为败，门窗立被捣碎。报馆再不敢报告失败，全国一片独立声，清廷震骇。九月（阴历）十三日上海闸北商团起义，全市白旗，沪军都督府成立，十五日我受苏州、常州、松江、镇江、太仓五地公推去苏州劝苏省巡抚程德全起义，程德全先已分电思想比较先进的几省督抚联名请清帝退位，我到苏则已全城白旗，即公推程德全为都督，我留苏办事，那时南京还给清军据守，程德全结合各省军队收复下来，移镇南京，军心民心一振。但党内部发生严重纠纷，同盟会组合的一单位领导人陶成章被沪军都督陈其美派蒋介石暗杀了。十一月四日中山先生归国抵上海，十一日南京临时参议院举先生为中华民国临时大总统。十三日就职，改那天为中华民国元年一月一日。二月十二日清帝溥仪退位，十三日先生向临时参议院辞大总统职，袁世凯继任。
    民国成立，同盟会被改组为国民党了，我没有参加。
    1913年二次革命失败，我不久亦辞江苏省教育司司长职。
    叛国的袁世凯不久死了。政海波涛，经过多次的翻腾，中山先生回上海了。1920年招我去，出示亲笔初稿“行易知难说”——后来定名孙文学说——征求意见，我答：向来读旧书只知“知之匪艰，行之惟艰”，今建立起新义来，让我细读一下。就留我和先生、夫人午餐。后来还承先生以初版本题款见赠。
    1922年先生又一次见招，那时陈炯明叛变，先生脱险回上海，问我对今后进行有何意见？我答：先生原有周游全国的计划，也已经走过若干地区。今后继续进行，使全国民众都站起来，能更普遍地更亲切地接受先生正确的领导，任何叛徒，只有自取灭亡。先生答：问题在帝国主义侵略，敌人一步一步紧逼，不容许我们从容准备。又很亲密地留我和先生、夫人共晚餐。
    那时我已经过很长时间在上海申报馆服务，承先生为我负责编辑的申报纪念册“最近之50年”作了一篇大文章——“中国之革命”。
    那时全世界受到1917年十月社会主义革命影响，1921年列宁派马丁来东方求友，在北京见到了李大钊，李大钊介绍马丁去南方见中山先生，彼此谈得亲洽，马丁建议两事：（1）建党；（2）建军。先生要求苏联协助，后来苏联派越飞、鲍罗庭两人先后来，一助建党，一助建军。
    就在1923年先生发表中国国民党改组宣言，确立了联俄、联共、扶助农工三大政策。
    不幸1925年先生逝世。遗嘱“……必须唤起民众，及联合世界上以平等待我之民族共同奋斗……”。最后还呼著：“和平、奋斗、救中国”。
    一切、一切还不够我们后起者永远地深刻纪念么！
    还愿附带一提：1906年1月同盟会机关报——“民报”第二号介绍了马克思、恩格斯的生平，还介绍了“共产党宣言”。到今五十年了。
    中国人民早解放了，中华人民共和国早成立了，中国人民在不断地回想着伟大的孙中山先生。
