Xinhua News Agency, November 3rd dispatch from New York: The United Nations Security Council held a meeting on the afternoon of November 2nd to discuss the "situation in Hungary" proposed by the United States, Britain, and France. The meeting was chaired by Iranian representative Ardalan.

    U.S. representative Lodge spoke first in the debate, citing Nagy's request to the United Nations for a guarantee of Hungary's so-called "neutrality," and asking the United Nations to consider what it could do to help the Hungarian counter-revolutionaries.

    Cuban representative Núñez, British representative Dixon, and French representative de Guiringaud all uttered the same old tunes about so-called "Soviet interference."

    Soviet representative Sobolev refuted the Western countries' slander in his speech, pointing out that the Western countries' request for the Security Council to discuss the Hungarian issue was an attempt to "divert people's attention from the Anglo-French aggression in Egypt."

    In the middle of the meeting, the chairman of the meeting, Ardalan, suggested that the Security Council not hold any more meetings until next Monday. This suggestion was opposed by the French representative. The meeting finally decided, based on the Cuban representative's suggestion, to hold another meeting today.

    Xinhua News Agency, November 4th dispatch from New York: Due to repeated requests from the representatives of the United States, Britain, and France, the United Nations Security Council convened another meeting on the afternoon of November 3rd to re-discuss the "situation in Hungary."

    The meeting finally decided to adjourn, with the next meeting to be held again on the morning of November 5th.

    Xinhua News Agency, November 4th dispatch from New York: At 3 a.m. this morning, at the request of U.S. representative to the United Nations Lodge, the United Nations Security Council held a temporary meeting to re-discuss the U.S. proposal on the Hungarian question.

    Soviet representative Sobolev opposed the U.S. proposal in his speech. He believed that the Security Council should not take action on this issue before it had grasped all the facts related to the Hungarian question. Sobolev pointed out that the enemies of the counter-revolution, who were attempting to restore the capitalist system in Hungary, were the cause of the unrest in Hungary. He pointed out that the riots in Hungary were instigated by subversives supported by the United States. He said that Soviet troops were stationed in Hungary in accordance with the Warsaw Pact, and therefore the Security Council had no right to interfere. Interference by the Security Council would only aggravate the situation in Hungary.

    After the representatives of various countries spoke, a vote was taken on the U.S. proposal. The Soviet representative voted against it, and Yugoslavia abstained.

    After the Soviet representative vetoed the proposal, the U.S. representative suggested that the Hungarian question be submitted to the United Nations General Assembly emergency session, which is currently discussing the Middle East issue. United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskjöld has announced that the United Nations General Assembly will meet at 8 p.m. today to continue discussing the Middle East issue. According to news agencies, the General Assembly may also discuss the Hungarian question at the same time.

    西方力图转移世界对英法侵埃的注意
    安理会再次讨论匈牙利问题
    据新华社3日讯　纽约消息：联合国安全理事会11月2日下午举行会议，讨论美、英、法三国提出的“匈牙利局势”问题。会议由伊朗代表安迪让主持。
    美国代表洛奇在辩论中首先发言，洛奇引用纳吉向联合国提出的保证匈牙利的所谓“中立”的请求，要联合国考虑能够作些什么来帮助匈牙利的反革命分子。
    古巴代表努奈斯、英国代表狄克逊、法国代表德居兰加发表了所谓“苏联干涉”的滥调。
    苏联代表索波列夫在发言中驳斥了西方国家代表的谰言，他指出，西方国家要求安理会讨论匈牙利问题是企图“把人们的注意力从英、法在埃及的侵略转移开。”
    在会议进行中间，会议主席安迪让曾经建议在下星期一以前安理会不再举行会议。这个建议遭到法国代表反对。会议最后根据古巴代表建议，确定今天再举行会议。
    据新华社4日讯　纽约消息：由于美、英、法三国代表再三要求，联合国安全理事会在11月3日下午又召开了一次会议，重新讨论“匈牙利局势”问题。
    会议最后决定休会，下次会议将在11月5日上午再次举行。
    据新华社4日讯　纽约消息：今晨三时，联合国安全理事会在美国驻联合国代表洛奇的要求下，举行了临时会议，再次讨论美国提出的关于匈牙利问题的提案。
    苏联代表索波列夫在发言中反对美国提案。他认为安理会在掌握有关匈牙利问题的全部事实之前不应该就这个问题采取行动。索波列夫指出，企图在匈牙利恢复资本主义制度的反革命的敌人是造成匈牙利骚乱的原因。他指出，匈牙利的暴动是受到美国支持的颠复分子所策动的。他说，苏联军队是根据华沙条约驻扎匈牙利的，因此安全理事会无权干涉。安理会的干涉只会加剧匈牙利的局势。
    在各国代表发言之后，就美国提案进行了表决，苏联代表投了反对票，南斯拉夫弃权。
    在苏联代表否决了这个提案之后，美国代表又建议将匈牙利问题提交目前正在讨论中东问题的联合国大会紧急会议讨论。联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德已经宣布，联合国大会将在今天下午八时开会继续讨论中东问题。据通讯社报道，大会可能同时讨论匈牙利问题。
