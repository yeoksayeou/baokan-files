    Ministry of Culture Convenes National Slide Projector Work Conference
    (Xinhua News Agency dispatch) The slide projector work, which has not received due attention for several years, is once again being emphasized. Zhang Zhixiang, Vice Minister of Culture, said at a tea party held by the Ministry of Culture to entertain all the attendees of the National Slide Projector Work Conference: Practice has proven that the masses love slide projectors, because they are forever a powerful tool for publicizing current events and policies, popularizing science and hygiene knowledge, disseminating advanced production experience, and enriching cultural and recreational life.
    The National Slide Projector Work Conference was convened by the Ministry of Culture in Beijing from the 12th to the 20th.
    The conference pointed out that slide projectors have always been welcomed by the masses. In recent years, due to the Ministry of Culture's failure to properly lead this work, it has been in a state of neglect for a long time. As a result, many cultural workers lack a correct understanding of slide projector work and do not pay attention to it, which has seriously affected the development of slide projector work.
    After analyzing these situations, the conference believes that it is first necessary to strengthen leadership in the future, implement the policy of rectifying and consolidating on the existing foundation, comprehensively planning, strengthening leadership, and developing steadily. The conference proposed that the task should be to focus on rural areas, and actively carry out slide projector work in minority areas, factories, mines, and among children; and suggested that the education departments carry out slide projector work in schools at all levels.
    The conference also requested that departments producing slide projectors and slides improve quality, especially to improve the ideological and artistic nature of slides, in order to meet the growing needs of the people.
    More than 70 representatives from the cultural bureaus of various provinces, cities, and autonomous regions, as well as representatives from some county cultural centers and relevant departments, attended the meeting.

    文化部召开全国幻灯工作会议
    据新华社讯　几年来没有得到应有的重视的幻灯工作，又重新被重视起来了。文化部副部长张致祥在文化部招待出席全国幻灯工作会议全体人员的茶会上说：实践证明，广大群众是喜爱幻灯的，因为它永远是宣传时事政策，普及科学、卫生知识，传播先进生产经验和丰富文娱生活的有力工具。
    全国幻灯工作会议是文化部于12日到20日在北京召开的。
    会议指出，幻灯是一贯受到广大群众欢迎的。近几年来由于文化部没有很好地对这一工作进行领导，使它长期处于无人管理的状态，也由此使得许多文化工作干部对幻灯工作缺乏正确的认识而不予重视，严重地影响了幻灯工作的发展。
    分析这些情况之后，会议认为今后首先要加强领导，贯彻在现有基础上整顿巩固、全面规划、加强领导、稳步发展的方针。会议提出应以面向农村为主，积极在少数民族地区、工厂矿山和儿童中开展幻灯工作为任务；并建议教育部门在各级学校开展幻灯工作。
    会议并要求幻灯机、幻灯片生产部门提高质量，特别要提高幻灯片的思想性和艺术性，以满足人民群众日益增长的需要。
    出席会议的有各省、市、自治区的文化局和部分县文化馆代表以及有关部门人员七十多人。
