    To enable workers to carry out the campaign of increasing production and practicing economy with vigor, it is necessary to earnestly resolve some problems encountered by workers in production and learning in some enterprises. The problems raised in the article "Why Has the Attendance Rate Decreased?" published on page two of today's newspaper are an example. Because it is impossible to carry out the campaign of increasing production and practicing economy well when the workers' attendance rate is decreasing.

    To build our large country with a backward economic foundation into a strong socialist industrial country, the working class does need to work hard and endure some hardship. This means not wasting every minute and second of production time, and finding ways to maximize the economic effect of every minute and second. For the long-term interests of the country, the living standards of workers cannot be raised too quickly, and some working conditions cannot be improved all at once. Workers need to overcome various difficulties in production and life with a spirit of hard work and endurance. For example, the supply of raw cotton in the textile industry is uneven. In order to ensure the supply of yarn and cloth to the market, it is necessary to increase the number of shifts in a certain quarter, thereby correspondingly increasing the intensity of labor.

    However, it is wrong if our work arrangements are unreasonable, thus bringing some unnecessary burdens to the workers, increasing unnecessary tension, and thus reducing the attendance rate. In order to further stimulate the enthusiasm of the masses of workers, and to strengthen the ties between the Party and the masses of workers, these problems must be resolved as soon as possible.

    Can the problem of excessive tension in workers' production and learning be solved? Of course, it can. Judging from the article "Why Has the Attendance Rate Decreased?", the main reasons for the excessive tension in production and learning are nothing more than: some labor quotas are not reasonable enough, some advanced experiences have increased the intensity of labor, making workers excessively nervous during production; too many meetings and excessively urgent requirements for spare-time learning prevent workers from getting adequate rest. Why are some labor quotas not set reasonably enough? Why should operational and management experiences that excessively increase labor intensity be organized and promoted? This is mainly because some enterprise leaders and higher-level leading organs have neglected the reasonable arrangement of workers' labor burden when determining labor quotas and advanced experiences. Of course, for the benefit of the country, increasing the intensity of labor a little under the condition that it does not affect the workers' health is permissible, and the masses of workers will not object to it. However, it is wrong to think that any experience or measure that can improve output and quality can be promoted and adopted, no matter how much it increases labor intensity. Because increasing labor intensity too much, in the long run, will damage the health of workers, frustrate their enthusiasm for production, and ultimately the national plan will still not be completed.

    Why are there so many meetings in factories? There are two reasons. One is that the "central" tasks arranged by the production and non-production leading organs are too numerous, and everything requires holding large-scale meetings to convey to the workers and organize workers to discuss. The second is that the leadership style of enterprises is simplistic, as if the Party's policies cannot be implemented and propaganda and mobilization cannot be carried out without holding meetings. Therefore, there are endless large and small meetings. Learning culture was originally voluntary for workers. Because the leading organs demand too much too quickly, the courses that regular schools take three years to complete are also required to be completed in three years by spare-time schools. Although the intention is good, because the number of classes per week is too many, the duration of each class is too long, and too much is taught, the workers cannot bear it. Therefore, it is necessary to overcome the bureaucratic work style of leaders at all levels and effectively streamline meetings. The organs issuing instructions and orders should consider the difficulties of enterprises and not arbitrarily require meetings to be convened for conveying and discussing. The leaders of enterprises should go deep down, and use the leadership method of solving problems individually to replace the unnecessary leadership method of holding meetings. It is also necessary to overcome the impetuous and rash mood in spare-time education work, appropriately reduce the number of classes per week, appropriately reduce the duration of each class, and appropriately extend the entire learning time limit. This will ensure that workers have adequate rest time and can carry out production and learning healthily and vigorously.

    让工人精神饱满地工作
    孔桑
    为了使工人们精神饱满地开展增产节约运动，就必须认真解决目前某些企业工人生产学习中的一些问题。今日本报第二版所载“出勤率为什么降低了”一文所提出的一些问题就是一个例子。因为在工人出勤率降低的情况下，要想很好地开展增产节约运动是不可能的。
    要把我们这样经济基础落后的大国建设成为强大的社会主义工业国，确实需要工人阶级进行紧张的劳动，需要吃一点苦。这就是不要浪费每一分一秒的生产时间，并且想办法使一分一秒钟都发挥最大的经济效果。为了国家的长远利益，工人的生活水平不能过快地提高，有些劳动条件也不能一下子改善，需要职工以吃苦耐劳的精神来克服生产上、生活上的各种困难。如纺织工业的原棉供应不均衡，为了保证市场对纱布的供应，在某一个季度里增加开工班次，因而相应地增加劳动紧张程度也是必要的。
    但是由于我们工作安排得不合理，因而给工人带来了一些不必要的负担，增加了不必要的紧张，因而使出勤率降低，这就不对了。为了进一步发挥职工群众生产积极性，密切党与工人群众的联系，必须及早解决这些问题。
    工人生产上学习上过分紧张的问题，可不可以解决呢？当然可以。从“出勤率为什么降低了”一文来看，造成生产上学习上过分紧张的主要原因，不外是：有些工时定额不够合理，有些先进经验增加了劳动强度，使工人在生产时精神过分紧张；会议太多，业余学习要求过急，使工人得不到充分的休息。为什么有些工时定额订得不够合理？为什么过分增加劳动强度的操作经验和管理经验，还要组织推广呢？这主要是有些企业领导人和上级领导机关，在决定工时定额和先进经验时，忽视了合理安排工人的劳动力负担。当然，为了国家的利益，在不影响工人健康的条件下，增加一点劳动强度，是可以的，工人群众也是不会反对的。但是，如果认为凡是可以提高产量和质量的经验或措施，不管它增加多少劳动强度，都可以推广和采纳，那就不对了。因为增加劳动强度过多，长期下去，就会损害工人的健康，挫伤他们的生产积极性，最终国家计划还是完不成的。
    工厂里的会议为什么如此之多呢？有两方面原因。一是生产的和非生产的领导机关布置的“中心”工作太多，而且事事都要求开大会向工人传达，组织工人讨论。二是企业的领导方式简单化，好像不开会就不能贯彻党的政策，就不能进行宣传鼓动似的，因而大会接小会，没个完。学文化，本来是工人自愿的。由于领导机关要求过急，正规学校三年才学完的课程，也要求业余学校在三年内学完。用心虽好，但因每周上课的次数太多，每次上课的时间太长，讲的东西太多，工人就负担不了。因此必须克服各级领导的官僚主义作风，切实精简会议。发指示、下命令的机关，要体谅企业的困难，不要随便要求开会传达、讨论。企业的领导人员，则应深入下去，多多用个别解决问题的领导方法来代替不必要的开会的领导方法。也要克服业余教育工作的急躁冒进情绪，把每周上课次数适当减少一些，每次授课时间适当减少一些，把整个学习时限适当延长一些。这样才能保证工人有充分的休息时间，身体健康地精神饱满地进行生产和学习。
