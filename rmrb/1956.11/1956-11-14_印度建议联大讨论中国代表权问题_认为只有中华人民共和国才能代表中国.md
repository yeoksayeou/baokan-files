Xinhua News Agency, 13th, New York Dispatch: Indian Representative to the United Nations, Mr. Lall, submitted a memorandum to the Secretary-General of the United Nations on the 12th. In this memorandum, India formally proposed that the issue of "China's representation in the United Nations" be included on the agenda of the Eleventh Session of the United Nations General Assembly. The United Nations Secretariat distributed the Indian memorandum. The memorandum stated:

    "China is one of the founding members of the United Nations and a permanent member of the Security Council. China's representation in the United Nations is of particular significance, not only because of these facts, but also because of its large population, abundant resources, and the extremely important contribution it must make to the solution of the major problems facing the United Nations General Assembly.

    For quite some time, only the Government of the People's Republic of China has exercised effective, uninterrupted, and indisputable power in China. Moreover, in accordance with the spirit and purpose of the Charter, only the Central People's Government is capable and prepared to represent the Chinese people in fulfilling the obligations related to membership in the United Nations as required by Articles 2 and 4 of the Charter. Fulfilling the obligations of a member state under the Charter is the declared policy of the Central People's Government. At the Asian-African Bandung Conference held from April 18 to 28, 1955, the Chinese delegation, headed by the Chinese Premier, was one of the strongest supporters of the United Nations and the United Nations Charter. The Central People's Government is recognized by approximately thirty countries, including two permanent members of the Security Council. Since the Central People's Government, in terms of its capacity and willingness to fulfill the obligations of the United Nations Charter, is the only government capable of representing China in the United Nations, depriving the Chinese government of its representation is not only contrary to the United Nations Charter and the United Nations' practice of treating member states, but also to the interests of the United Nations, the promotion of world peace, and international cooperation.

    The current situation regarding the China seat issue cannot be considered to be in accordance with the requirements of the Charter, and it seriously hinders the United Nations from completing its tasks and constructively addressing the problems it faces. The absence of a Chinese representative in the United Nations effectively deprives a large area of Asia and nearly a quarter of the world's population of the right to participate in the General Assembly, the Security Council, specialized agencies, and other United Nations bodies. Without China's cooperation, it is impossible to effectively deal with Far East issues, general world issues, and especially disarmament issues, the peaceful use of atomic energy, and the economic development of underdeveloped countries. If the United Nations is to realistically and truly address the problems it faces, the appropriate government of China must be represented in the United Nations.

    The method used in recent years—declaring a postponement of the consideration of the issue of China's representation in the United Nations—prevents this increasingly important matter from receiving due discussion. Taking into account the growing urgency to correct the status quo and due consideration of the provisions of Rule 15 of the Rules of Procedure of the United Nations General Assembly, the Indian delegation believes it is necessary to submit this separate issue to the Eleventh Session of the United Nations General Assembly: the issue of ‘China's representation in the United Nations’.”

### 印度建议联大讨论中国代表权问题  认为只有中华人民共和国才能代表中国

    印度建议联大讨论中国代表权问题
    认为只有中华人民共和国才能代表中国
    新华社13日讯　纽约消息：印度驻联合国代表拉尔12日向联合国秘书长提出了一项备忘录。在这项备忘录中，印度正式提议将“中国在联合国的代表权”问题列入联合国大会第十一届会议的议程。联合国秘书处散发了印度的这项备忘录。备忘录说：
    “中国是联合国的发起国之一，也是安全理事会的常任理事国。中国在联合国的代表权之具有特别意义，不仅是由于这些事实，还由于它的居民众多、资源丰富以及它对联合国大会面临的重大问题的解决所必须作出的极其重要的贡献。
    已经有相当长的一段时期，只有中华人民共和国政府在中国行使了有效的、不间断的、无可争辩的权力。而且，根据宪章的精神和宗旨，也只有中央人民政府有能力并且准备代表中国人民执行宪章第二条和第四条所要求的、同联合国会员国资格有关的义务。履行根据宪章所承担的会员国的义务是中国中央人民政府所宣布的政策。在从1955年4月18日到28日举行的亚非万隆会议上，以中国总理为首的中国代表团是联合国和联合国宪章的最有力的拥护者之一。中央人民政府得到约三十个国家、其中包括安理会两个常任理事国的承认。既然中央人民政府，就它履行联合国宪章的义务的能力和意愿来讲，是能够在联合国代表中国的唯一政府；那么剥夺中国政府的代表权不仅同联合国宪章和联合国对待会员国的惯例相抵触，而且还同联合国的利益、促进世界和平事业和国际合作相抵触。
    现在在中国席位问题上存在的情况绝不能认为是符合宪章的要求的，这严重地妨碍了联合国完成它所负担的任务和建设性地处理它面临的问题。联合国中没有中国代表，这实际上就剥夺了亚洲的大片地区和占世界近四分之一人口参加大会、安理会、专门机构和联合国其他机构的权利。如果没有中国的合作，在处理远东问题、一般的世界问题、特别是裁军问题、和平利用原子能问题和不发达国家的经济发展问题时，是不可能有效的。如果要使联合国现实地真正地处理它所面临的问题，联合国中必须要有应有的中国政府的代表。
    最近这些年中所用的办法——宣布延期审议中国在联合国的代表权的问题——使这个越来越重要的事情不能得到应有的讨论。考虑到日益迫切地必须纠正现状和理应考虑联合国大会议事规则第十五条的规定，印度代表团认为必须向联合国大会第十一届会议提出这个单独问题：‘中国在联合国的代表权’问题。”
