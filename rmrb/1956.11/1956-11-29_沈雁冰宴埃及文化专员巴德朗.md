Xinhua News Agency, November 28th: Minister of Culture Shen Yanbing held a banquet this evening to welcome Egyptian Cultural Attaché to China, Mr. Badran, and his wife.

    At the banquet, Shen Yanbing said that cultural exchanges between China and Egypt have existed since ancient times. Recently, with the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Egypt, cultural exchanges have become more frequent. Today's welcome to Mr. Badran is of greater significance for the further development of cultural exchanges in the future.

    Shen Yanbing said that in world history, the light of Western culture first came from the Nile, and in the East, it first came from the Yellow River basin. In the recent hundred years, the Chinese and Egyptian people have suffered from imperialist aggression and carried out anti-imperialist struggles. Both peoples have only recently achieved independence, freedom, and liberation. Now imperialism is still carrying out aggression against Egypt, just as it does not forget to invade China. Therefore, the friendship between China and Egypt is not only a friendship, but also a brotherhood.

    Egyptian Ambassador to China, Hassan Ragab, said that since Egypt recognized China, it has gained a deeper understanding of China's position, China's cause, and China's future. Egypt attaches importance to the past relationship between the two countries and the development of future relations. He wished that the cultural relations between the two countries would develop even better than today. He believes that the friendship between the two peoples will be even more consolidated.

    Also welcomed today were Mr. Saeed Salem and Mr. Hilemi, the archival secretaries of the Egyptian Embassy in China, as well as four Egyptian students who came to China to study agriculture, fine arts, and philosophy.

    Attending the banquet as guests were Burhan, President of the Chinese-Egyptian Friendship Association, and his wife, Dapu Sheng, Vice Chairman of the China Islamic Association, Ma Yuhuai, President of the China Islamic Theological Seminary, and heads of literary and artistic groups.

    沈雁冰宴埃及文化专员巴德朗
    新华社28日讯　文化部部长沈雁冰今天晚上举行宴会欢迎埃及驻华大使馆文化专员巴德朗和他的夫人。
    沈雁冰在宴会上说，中国和埃及的文化交流从远古以来就有的，最近，中埃建立外交关系，文化交流更为频繁，今天欢迎巴德朗先生对于此后文化交流的进一步发展，具有更大的意义。
    沈雁冰说，在世界历史上，西方文化曙光首先来自尼罗河，在东方，首先来自黄河流域。最近百年来，中国和埃及人民同样受到帝国主义的侵略，同样进行了反帝国主义的斗争。两国人民也是在最近取得了独立、自由和解放。现在帝国主义还在向埃及进行侵略，正像它不忘记要侵略中国一样。所以中国和埃及不仅仅是朋友的情谊，还是兄弟的情谊。
    埃及驻中国大使哈桑·拉加卜说，当埃及承认中国后，对中国的立场、中国的事业、中国的未来都有了更深切的了解。埃及重视两国过去的关系和今后关系的发展。他预祝两国文化关系将发展得比今天更加良好。他相信两国人民的友谊将更为巩固。
    今天同时受欢迎的还有埃及驻华大使馆的档案秘书赛义德·萨勒姆和希勒米二人，以及埃及来中国学习农业、美术和哲学的留学生四人。
    今天出席宴会作陪的有中国埃及友好协会会长包尔汉和他的夫人，中国伊斯兰教协会副主任达浦生，中国伊斯兰教经学院院长马玉槐，以及文学艺术团体的负责人。
