Xinhua News Agency, November 23rd, Cairo dispatch: Egyptian Political Bureau Chief Sabri, on November 22nd, called on the nation via Cairo Radio to remain vigilant against the plans of Egypt's former colonialists and their allies. He said they would attempt to create trouble before withdrawing their troops.

　　Sabri said Egypt has not taken any partial demobilization actions because the country remains aware of existing dangers.

　　He said that if the British and French forces do not completely withdraw from Egyptian territory, or decide to withdraw only part of their forces, Egypt will resume fighting.

　　Sabri said that many volunteer forces have expressed their willingness to fight alongside Egypt against colonialism. They have expressed their desire to fight colonialism in our ranks. He said: "If we have been slow to give them a reply, it is only because we do not want the world to have a more tense situation, a tense situation that may cause a world war, and the catastrophic consequences of such a war are difficult to predict."

　　Sabri also said that Egypt does not belong to any bloc, neither the Eastern nor the Western bloc, and opposes all foreign interference, no matter which side that interference comes from.

　　Sabri finally said that before the attack on Egypt began, French planes were seen in Israel. He said that British and French tanks had participated in the battles of Gaza and Rafah alongside Israeli forces.
　　
Xinhua News Agency, November 23rd, Damascus dispatch: Syrian Prime Minister al-Assali said on the 22nd that Syria is prepared to deal with aggression from British, French and Israeli troops massing on the Syrian and Jordanian borders.

　　Syrian Defense Minister Abd al-Hassib Raslan said: "We will respond to any attack with twice the severity."

　　Prior to this, Syrian Foreign Minister Bitar telegraphed UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld on the 21st, accusing Israel of colluding with Britain and France to amass troops on the Syrian and Jordanian borders in an attempt to invade.

    新华社23日讯　开罗消息：埃及政治局局长萨布里11月22日在开罗电台号召全国人民必须对埃及的前殖民者及其同盟者的计划继续保持警惕。他说，它们会企图在撤军之前先制造麻烦的。
    萨布里说，埃及没有采取过部分复员的行动，因为这个国家仍然知道有危险存在。
    他说，如果英法军队不完全撤出埃及的土地，或者决定只撤退它们的一部分部队的话，埃及将重新进行战斗。
    萨布里说，有许多志愿军已经表示愿意和埃及一起作战来反对殖民主义。他们已经表示了愿意在我们的队伍中和殖民主义作战的希望。他说：“如果我们曾经迟迟不给他们回答，这只是因为我们想不让这个世界发生更紧张的局势，这种紧张局势可能引起世界战争，而这种战争的灾难性的后果是难以预料的。”
    萨布里还说，埃及不属于任何集团，无论是东方集团或者是西方集团，并且反对一切外国干涉，不管这种干涉来自那一方面。
    萨布里最后说，在对埃及的进攻开始以前，曾经看到有法国的飞机在以色列，他说，英法的坦克曾经同以色列部队一起参加了加沙和拉法的战斗。
    新华社23日讯　大马士革消息：叙利亚总理阿萨里22日说，叙利亚已经准备好对付集结在叙利亚和约旦边界的英法和以色列军队的侵略。
    叙利亚国防部长阿卜杜勒·哈西卜·雷斯兰说：“我们将对任何的攻击予以双倍严重的回击。”
    在这之前，叙利亚外交部长比塔尔曾经在21日拍电报给联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德，指责以色列勾结英法在叙利亚和约旦的边界集结军队企图侵略。
