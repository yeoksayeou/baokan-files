Fish Fry Farm on the Guizhou Plateau

    In the plateau area of Guizhou Province, more than 1,000 meters above sea level, the fish industry will also be gradually developed in the future. This year, the first state-owned Huaxi Fish Fry Farm, which guides the province's fish farming industry, was established in the suburbs of Guiyang City. The high-quality fish fry transported from other provinces are cultured here for a short period to acclimatize them to living in mountain ponds. Then, these fish fry are transported to various counties, regions, and autonomous prefectures, so that people in the mountainous areas can also eat a large amount of fresh fish.

    贵州高原的鱼种养殖场
    在拔海一千多公尺的贵州省高原地带，今后也要逐步发展鱼业了。今年在贵阳市郊成立了第一所指导全省养鱼事业的国营花溪鱼种养殖场，从外省运来的优良鱼苗，在这里经过短期培养，使它们习惯于在山区的池塘中生活，然后再把这些鱼苗运到各县、专区和自治州去，让山区人民也能吃到大量鲜鱼。
