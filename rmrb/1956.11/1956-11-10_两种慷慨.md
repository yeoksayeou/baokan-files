Two Kinds of Generosity
    Gao Zhi
    There are two instances of generosity. One concerns treating people to meals, as reported on page 2 of the People's Daily on October 18th. The other also relates to treating people to meals, as seen on page 3 of the Beijing Daily on the same day.

    The first is the kind of treating to meals favored by the Party Secretary and Directors of the Tongguanshan Mining Bureau. They enjoyed hosting banquets, finding tricks to justify them, hosting for the sake of hosting, and were extremely generous in doing so. Any holiday, meeting, visit, inspection, or welcoming and sending-off occasion served as an excuse for a banquet. Each time, there were "unfinishable" delicacies, fine wines, pastries, and fruits. After the feasting and drinking, they would treat the guests to opera, movies, and circuses.

    Their banquets had several characteristics: Firstly, the frequency of banquets was high. Secondly, the number of tables at each banquet was large. Thirdly, the amount of fine wine, delicacies, cigarettes, and fruits was plentiful. Fourthly, there were many after-dinner entertainment activities. Fifthly, there were many people accompanying the guests. Sixthly, a lot of money was spent. However, there was one "minor" imperfection: the constraint of national financial regulations, "sometimes reimbursement was not so smooth," which caused the Party Secretary to "sigh endlessly."

    The second is the kind of treating to meals exemplified by Zhao Lanfen, a ticket seller at the Qipan Street Bus Station in Beijing. One evening, the wife of a worker from the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, with her child, missed the last bus and had little money. She had no food and no place to stay, finding herself in a very difficult situation. At that moment, Zhao Lanfen generously invited the female passenger and her child to stay overnight at her own home, and also treated the guest to a "comfortable dinner."

    Although both of these acts of treating to meals are generous, there is a significant difference between them.

    Firstly, the Party Secretary and Directors of the Tongguanshan Mining Bureau were using "public funds" to host their banquets. The ticket seller used her own money. Using public funds for banquets is justified if the banquets are necessary, but unjustified if they are unnecessary. Were the banquets hosted by the Secretary and Directors necessary? Perhaps a few of the many banquets were necessary. However, with so many occasions and such lavish displays, it is clear that they were wasting state resources, which was both unnecessary and unjustified. They were being generous at the expense of others! Generous at the expense of the state! As for the ticket seller's invitation, it was both necessary and appropriate.

    Secondly, considering the perspective of the people being treated. The aforementioned Secretary and Directors were finding tricks and excuses to host banquets. Furthermore, there were few guests and many escorts. Neither the guests nor the escorts needed to be there. What good does this style of work do, other than fostering the bad habit of "using public office for private gain" among some people? As for the worker's wife, she was invited to dinner by a stranger when she was in a state of extreme difficulty. The worker's wife felt the warmth of human kindness in the new society. When she tells her husband and other workers about this, it will inevitably make them love the new society even more and work harder in production.

    In the new society, we still need generosity. But it should be the kind of generosity that helps people in emergencies, the kind of generosity that offers charcoal in the snow. Using public office for private gain, wasting public funds, and being generous at the expense of the state are absolutely unacceptable.

    Perhaps the Party Secretary and Directors are good in other respects, but extravagance and waste are always wrong. I think they should all have the courage to correct their mistakes. And I believe that there must be a second and a third Zhao Lanfen.

    两种慷慨
    高植
    有两件慷慨事，一件是关于请客吃饭的，见10月18日人民日报第二版，另一件也和请客吃饭有关，见同日北京日报第三版。
    第一件是铜官山矿务局的党委书记和局长们的那种请客吃饭。他们欢喜请客，找窍门请客，为请客而请客，并且请的非常慷慨。任何节日、会议、参观、来访，以及迎新送旧，都是请客的借口。每次请客，好菜美酒、点心水果，都“吃不完”。吃喝之后，还要请客看戏，看电影，看马戏。
    他们请客，有几个特色：一是请客次数多，二是酒席桌数多，三是好酒好菜香烟水果分量多，四是饭后文娱活动多，五是陪客特别多，六是花钱多。不过也有一个“美”中不足的地方。那就是还有着国家财务制度的约束，“有时报销不那么顺利”，这使那个党委书记也只好“无限感叹”。
    第二件是北京棋盘街汽车站售票员赵兰芬的那种请客吃饭。有一天晚上，石景山钢铁厂一个工人的妻子带着孩子，没有赶上末班车，手头又没有多钱。她没有吃饭，没有住处，很感为难。就在这时候，赵兰芬慷慨地让这个女乘客带孩子在他自己家里住了一宿，还请客人“舒舒服服地吃了顿晚饭”。
    这两种请客虽然都慷慨，但是大有差别。
    首先，铜官山矿务局党委书记和局长们请客，用的是“公家钱”。售票员请客，用的是自家的钱。用公家钱请客，如其请的必要，就是应该的，如其不必要，就是不应该的。那末书记、局长们请客，是不是必要的呢？在许多次的请客之中，也许有几次是必要的。但是次数那么多，排场那么大，这显然是浪费国家财力，既不必要也不应该了。他们是在慷他人之慨！慷国家之慨！至于售票员那次请客，既是必要的，也是应该的。
    其次，从被请的人那方面来看。上述书记、局长们请客，是找窍门、找借口请客的。并且客人少，陪客多。客人和陪客都没有被请的必要。这种作风，除了会养成某些人“以公济私”的坏习气而外，还有什么好处呢？至于那个工人的妻子，她是在万分为难的时候，被一个素不相识的人请去吃饭的。工人的妻子感到新社会里人情温暖，向她丈夫、向其他工人们说说这件事，必然会使他们更加热爱新社会，在生产上更起劲。
    在新社会里，我们也还需要慷慨。但那要是救人之急的慷慨，雪中送炭的慷慨。以公济私，浪费公款，慷国家之慨，是千万要不得的。
    可能，那位党委书记和局长在其他方面还是好的，但是，铺张浪费总是错误的。我想，他们都应该有勇气改正错误。而第二个、第三个赵兰芬，我相信，也一定是有的。
