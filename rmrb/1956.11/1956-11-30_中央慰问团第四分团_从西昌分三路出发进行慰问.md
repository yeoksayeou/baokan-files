Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, November 28th: The fourth subgroup of the Central慰问团 departed from Xichang today in three routes to conduct慰问 in Muli, JinKuang, Huili and other counties.

In the past few days, the fourth subgroup held a慰问 conference of more than 15,000 people in Xichang, and held discussions with representatives of some upper-level figures and representatives of the working people on some current work issues.

During its stay in Xichang, the medical team accompanying the group provided free treatment to more than 1,700 people from various ethnic groups. The慰问 performances and screenings by the cultural troupe and film team accompanying the group were watched by nearly 100,000 people.

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, November 29th: More than 200 representatives of upper-level figures from the Yi, Tibetan, and Mongolian ethnic groups and representatives of the working people from various counties in the Xichang area have held discussions with the fourth subgroup of the Central慰问团 in the past few days to jointly study the issue of democratic reform in the counties of the area in a spirit of consultation. Huang Juean, the head of the subgroup, conveyed to the representatives the Central Committee’s general policy and specific policies on carrying out democratic reform in minority areas, listened to the representatives’ opinions, and conducted research and consultation with the representatives on some issues in the democratic reform.

The Xichang area is an area where many ethnic groups live together. Democratic reform has been completed in five counties with a population of more than 100,000, and it is underway in another five counties. Because some of the upper-level figures of minority ethnic groups in some areas do not understand the policies of democratic reform and have many doubts in their minds, the smooth progress of democratic reform work in some places has been affected. This symposium was conducted in response to this situation.

The representatives of upper-level figures of ethnic minorities who attended the meeting expressed their satisfaction with this symposium, believing that it specifically embodied the spirit of various ethnic groups managing their own internal affairs. They were particularly grateful to the government for its multifaceted care for upper-level figures. Six upper-level figures from Xichang County who had great doubts about democratic reform expressed on the spot their willingness to further consult with the government to study specific measures for democratic reform and maintaining public security.

The symposium started on the 21st and lasted for four days. On the basis of unified understanding, it was unanimously decided to adopt the method of visiting relatives and friends to widely publicize the government's policies on democratic reform in order to dispel the doubts of some upper-level figures and gradually complete the democratic reform work in the minority areas of the area.

    中央慰问团第四分团
    从西昌分三路出发进行慰问
    曾和西昌各族代表协商民主改革问题，少数民族上层人士表示满意。
    新华社成都28日电　中央慰问团第四分团今天从西昌出发分三路到木里、金矿、会理等县去进行慰问。
    在过去几天中，第四分团曾经在西昌举行了一万五千多人的慰问大会，并和一些上层人士代表、劳动人民代表座谈了一些当前工作中的问题。
    随团的医疗队在逗留西昌期间，免费为各民族人民治疗一千七百多人次。随团文工队和电影队的慰问演出和放映活动，有近十万人次观看。
    新华社成都29日电　来自西昌专区各县的二百多名彝、藏、蒙古族上层人士代表和劳动人民代表，这几天分别同中央慰问团第四分团举行座谈，以协商的精神，共同研究了专区各县的民主改革问题。分团团长黄觉庵向代表们传达了中央关于在少数民族地区进行民主改革的力针和具体政策，听取了代表们的意见，并且和代表们就民主改革中一些问题进行了研究和协商。
    西昌专区是一个民族杂居的地区，已经有五个县约十万多人口的地区完成了民主改革，另有五个县也正在进行中。由于有一部分地区的少数民族上层人士对民主改革的政策不了解，心里存在着许多疑虑，影响了一些地方民主改革工作的顺利进行。这次座谈会是针对这一情况进行的。
    到会的少数民族上层人士代表对这次座谈会都表示满意，认为它具体体现了各民族管理本民族内部事务的精神。他们特别感激政府对上层人士多方面的照顾。西昌县有六名对民主改革疑虑很大的上层人士当场表示愿意和政府进一步协商，研究民主改革和维护治安等工作的具体措施。
    座谈会从21日开始，共进行了四天。在认识统一的基础上，一致决定要采用串亲戚、访朋友的办法，广泛宣传政府有关民主改革的政策，来解除某些上层人士的疑虑，逐步完成专区内少数民族地区的民主改革工作。
