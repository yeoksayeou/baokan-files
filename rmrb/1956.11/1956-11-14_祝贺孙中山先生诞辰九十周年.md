    Xinhua News Agency, November 13th -- The President of the Finnish-Chinese Association, Urho Kahonen, sent a telegram to the Preparatory Committee for the Ninetieth Anniversary of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Birth. The full text is as follows:
    To the Preparatory Committee for the Ninetieth Anniversary of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Birth:
    Due to certain insurmountable obstacles, we were unable to send a representative to attend the grand meeting commemorating the ninetieth anniversary of Dr. Sun Yat-sen after receiving your kind invitation. The Finnish-Chinese Association hereby extends its greetings to the meeting. This association, which aims to promote close relations between the peoples of Finland and China, congratulates the Chinese people on having such a pioneer as Sun Yat-sen in their most difficult days. At the beginning of our century, he sent out a signal, thus beginning a movement aimed at overthrowing the monarchy, which had become corrupt both internally and externally, liberating the country from foreign oppression and protection, and awakening the Chinese people, who had suffered enormously, from centuries of humiliation. It is no accident that Dr. Sun Yat-sen, who represented the Chinese intelligentsia and attracted them to the national revolution with his example and actions, became the first president of China. On the foundation he laid, those who inherited his experience and vision are following a difficult path towards a victorious goal.
    Greetings,
    President of the Finnish-Chinese Association, Urho Kahonen
      Helsinki, November 7, 1956
    Xinhua News Agency, November 13th -- Miyazaki Ryusuke of Japan wrote a letter to the Preparatory Committee for the Ninetieth Anniversary of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Birth, congratulating them on the ninetieth anniversary of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's birth.
    The letter stated that we, who cannot attend your country's grand commemorative meeting, discussed with more than a dozen other people who admired Dr. Sun Yat-sen and decided to respond to your country's grand commemoration by holding a commemorative meeting in Tokyo for the ninetieth anniversary of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's birth, to cherish Dr. Sun Yat-sen's great contributions to China's independence and democratic revolution, and to further enhance the friendship of mutual assistance and cooperation between China and Japan, which was once consolidated by Dr. Sun Yat-sen.
    Now in China, Dr. Sun Yat-sen's ideal of people's livelihood, for which he strived throughout his life but failed to achieve, has been brilliantly realized under the leadership of Chairman Mao and other leaders. Not only that, but this ideal has developed into socialism, bringing peace and happiness to all the Chinese people.
    The letter concluded by saying that Dr. Sun Yat-sen's spirit, like young China born and growing up under the brilliant sunshine, will last forever.

    孙中山先生诞辰九十周年纪念筹备委员会
    由于某些不可克服的障碍，在接到您们善意的邀请以后未能派遣一位代表来参加孙逸仙博士诞辰九十周年纪念大会，芬中协会谨在此向大会致意。旨在促进芬中两国人民的密切关系的本协会，祝贺中国人民在他们最艰苦的日子里得到像孙逸仙那样的一位先驱者，这位在我们世纪的开端就发出信号，从而开始了目的在于推翻内外都已腐朽的君主制度，将国家从外国的压迫和保护下解放出来，唤起遭受了巨大苦难的中国人民从千百年来的被侮辱的境况下站立起来的运动。代表着中国知识阶层并用他的范例和行动吸引着知识阶层走向民族革命的孙逸仙博士，成为中国的第一任总统决不是偶然的。在他所奠定的基础上，那些继承他的有经验和有远见的人们正在走着指向胜利目标的艰苦道路。
    致意

    宫崎龙介的贺信
    新华社13日讯　日本宫崎龙介写信给孙中山先生诞辰九十周年纪念筹备委员会，祝贺孙中山先生诞辰九十周年。
    信中说，不能参加贵国的盛大的纪念大会的我们，同其他景仰孙中山先生的十几位人士进行商谈，决定响应贵国的盛大纪念，在东京举行孙中山先生诞辰九十周年纪念会，缅怀孙中山先生对中国的独立和民主主义革命的伟大功绩，并且能够更加增进曾经由孙中山先生巩固起来的中国和日本的互助合作的友谊。
    现在在中国，孙中山先生毕生努力而未能实现的民生理想，已经在毛主席和其他领导人的领导下卓越地实现了。不仅如此，而且这种理想发展到社会主义、给全中国人民带来了安宁和幸福。
    信中最后说，孙中山先生的精神就像在光辉的阳光下诞生和成长起来的年青的中国那样，永世长存。
