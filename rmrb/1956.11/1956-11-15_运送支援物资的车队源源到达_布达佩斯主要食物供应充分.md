Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, November 14th: Convoys are continuously transporting large quantities of food from the urban and rural areas of Hungary and from neighboring fraternal countries to Budapest. This capital, which has just crushed the counter-revolutionary rebellion, has been provided with an ample supply of main foods.

　　On November 12th, 360 trucks of food arrived in Budapest. Now, the bakeries here have reached normal production levels, and the supply of bread is sufficient. Yesterday, 32 trucks of meat transported from the Soviet Union were rationed to the residents of Budapest. The day before, Budapest stores were allocated 1,500 quintals of meat, 1,770 quintals of lard, and various sausages. In addition, there were butter, milk, and cheese. Eleven trucks of poultry also arrived in Budapest in the past two days. At Zahony, on the Hungarian-Soviet border, 330 trucks of flour, sugar, meat, lemons, and canned goods transported from the Soviet Union are waiting to be transported to Budapest. By the weekend, the supply of essential foods here will be even more satisfactory.

　　In ensuring supplies, children, the sick, and the disabled are receiving special care. Milk shops have been set up in each district of Budapest specifically to supply milk to children. Hospitals, clinics, and dispensaries have received various medicines, underwear, and other equipment. The Hungarian Red Cross is expanding its work. Thousands of working people are assisting in tidying up hospitals and providing fuel and supplies to hospitals.

　　More and more workers in Budapest have started working, which has greatly contributed to the restoration of the capital's public utilities. Now, almost all districts in the city have electricity, gas, and water supplies. Only the eighth and ninth districts of the capital, which had been the centers of the counter-revolutionary armed rebellion, were particularly severely damaged. Extensive restoration work is being prepared and will be carried out there first to repair the electricity and gas networks.

　　According to a notification from the Hungarian Police Department, robberies and other crimes have decreased in Budapest and other cities. Workers' self-defense forces and special police teams established in accordance with the Ministry of Public Security's decision have participated in protecting state property and citizens' private property. According to an officer of the Public Security Bureau to Budapest radio staff, the main task of the public security organs, in cooperation with the workers' self-defense forces, is to eliminate groups of criminals, bandits, and thieves. These bandits attempted to sabotage the already restored normal business of some stores and warehouses this Sunday. On this day, with the effective assistance of the people of the capital, the public security organs cleared out several such gangs of bandits. To strengthen the security work in the capital, public security sub-bureaus have now been established in various districts of Budapest.

　　Life in the rural areas of Hungary is also rapidly returning to normal. Schools in Pest County have reopened. This county not only guarantees its own food supply, but will also transport 8,000 geese and ducks to Budapest. The autumn sowing work in Pest County is continuing. News from Nagykőrös says that the food supply in this county has also been guaranteed, and they are also supplying Budapest with vegetables.

　　Field work in Baranya County was interrupted for only two days and has now resumed. Field work in Nógrád County is actively underway. In Szabolcs County, farmers are carrying out field work and preparing a large amount of potatoes to be transported to Budapest to meet the needs of the capital's citizens.
