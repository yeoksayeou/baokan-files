Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, November 12th: The President of the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League of Burma, U Nu, told Burmese and foreign reporters on the afternoon of the 10th that the discussions on border issues he held with the Chinese authorities were conducted in a friendly and sincere atmosphere. He said that the talks were based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence signed by China and Burma.

U Nu believes that the joint communique published simultaneously in the newspapers of the two countries conforms to the wishes of the people of both countries and will be welcomed by the Chinese and Burmese people.

On the evening of November 10th, U Nu pointed out again in a radio speech broadcast by the Burmese Broadcasting Station that both China and Burma hoped to make a comprehensive solution to the entire border issue on the basis of the Five Principles. He said, "If a final solution is reached, it will be a Sino-Burmese border that is demarcated between two friendly neighbors and will last forever, a border that both sides will be satisfied with and respect, a peaceful border, and a border that does not require guarding troops on either side."

U Nu emphasized at a press conference held on the afternoon of the 10th that there was nothing reliable to indicate that the boundary between China and Burma had ever been completely determined at any time. U Nu emphasized that in the course of the discussion, Premier Zhou Enlai showed a sense of justice and fairness in resolving the border issue. He said that we both took a realistic view.

When U Nu talked about the problems that occurred in the Wa State, he emphasized that China did not invade the Wa State. Colonel Lun, who attended the press conference together, said that according to a letter received by the Ministry of National Defense on November 8th from the commander of the 6th Brigade defense zone (Wa State) and another letter sent by this commander the next day, the Chinese army had withdrawn from the Wa State.

Someone asked U Nu if he believed that the Chinese government would be prepared to resolve disputes with the West and the Taiwan authorities. He said that he could not speak for the West, but he believed that "the Chinese government is working for peace"; "they are fully prepared to find a peaceful solution to the Taiwan issue." U Nu pointed out that the Chinese government had said that if representatives of the Taiwan authorities wanted to come to the mainland of China for talks, the Chinese government "will guarantee that these representatives will return to Taiwan safely after the talks." U Nu further pointed out that the Preparatory Committee for the 90th Anniversary of the Birth of Sun Yat-sen had also invited Kuomintang members from Taiwan to participate in the commemorative activities in Beijing.

When someone asked U Nu if he had told the US government about this attitude of China, he said, "When I was in the United States, I told Dulles about this attitude, but Mr. Dulles said, 'This is new news to him.'"

    吴努主席在仰光告诉记者说
    中缅会谈符合和平共处原则
    新华社仰光12日电　缅甸反法西斯人民自由同盟主席吴努10日下午告诉缅甸和外国的记者说，中国当局和他所举行的边界问题的讨论是在友好和诚恳的气氛中进行的。他说，会谈是以中国和缅甸签署过的和平共处的五项原则为基础的。
    吴努相信，两个国家同时在报上发表的联合公报是符合两国人民的愿望的，它将受到中缅人民的欢迎。
    11月10日晚上，吴努在缅甸广播电台发表的广播演说中再次指出，中国和缅甸都希望在五项原则的基础上对整个边界问题作出全面的解决。他说，“假如取得最后解决的话，它将是一条作为两个友好的邻国之间划定的并且将持久下去的中缅边界，一条双方都会感到满意并且加以尊重的边界，一条和平的边界，一条不需要在任何一边驻守警戒部队的边界。”
    吴努在10日下午举行的记者招待会上说，没有可靠的东西足以表明中国和缅甸之间的边界曾经在任何时候完全确定过。吴努强调说，在讨论的过程中，周恩来总理对解决边界问题表示了正义感和公正感。他说，我们两人都采取了一种现实的观点。
    吴努谈到在瓦邦所发生的问题时强调说，中国并没有侵略瓦邦。一起出席记者招待会的伦上校说，据国防部在11月8日收到的第六旅防区（瓦邦）司令官的信件以及在第二天从这个司令官发来的另一封信说，中国军队已经撤出瓦邦。
    有人问吴努，他是否相信中国政府会准备和西方以及台湾当局解决争端。他说，他不能代表西方讲话，但是他相信，“中国政府在为和平而工作”；“他们完全准备寻找一个关于台湾问题的和平解决办法”，吴努指出，中国政府说过，假如台湾当局的代表们想到中国大陆来举行会谈的话，中国政府“将保证这些代表们在会谈后安全地返回台湾”。吴努进一步指出，孙中山先生诞辰九十周年纪念筹备委员会也曾经邀请台湾的国民党人参加北京的纪念活动。
    当有人问吴努是否已经把中国的这种态度告诉给美国政府的时候，他说，“当我在美国的时候，我已经把这种态度告诉杜勒斯，但是，杜勒斯先生说，‘这对他是一个新消息’”。
