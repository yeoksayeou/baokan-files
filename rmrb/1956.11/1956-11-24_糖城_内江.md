Neijiang City, Sichuan Province, known as "Sugar City," has entered its annual sugarcane pressing season. Surrounded by a green expanse of sugarcane fields, the suburban areas and neighboring counties have organized sugarcane farmers who are reaping their most abundant harvest since liberation. They are continuously transporting sugarcane to the sugar factories using wooden boats, carts, and specially made back carriers. The massive sugar factories are swallowing entire vehicles and boatloads of sugarcane while producing thousands upon thousands of kilograms of cane sugar. This cane sugar is immediately loaded onto trains and then distributed to various regions within and outside the province. Neijiang City has already shipped over a thousand tons of new sugar this year.

In 1952, Neijiang City produced over 5,400 tons of cane sugar. Last year, cane sugar production increased to over 23,000 tons. However, at this time last year, cane sugar production mainly relied on sixty-eight traditional sugar workshops, where sugarcane juice was extracted by water buffalo dragging stone rollers. This year, all cane sugar production here is mechanized. The newly built Neijiang Sugar Factory, the largest in Sichuan Province, can press 1,200 tons of sugarcane per day, with a production capacity exceeding that of all the traditional sugar workshops combined. The sugar-making process takes only one-sixth of the time required by the traditional workshops, and it yields an additional 100 kilograms of cane sugar per ton of sugarcane pressed. Additionally, two semi-mechanized sugar factories have also added machinery and equipment.

The development of the sugar industry has brought unprecedented prosperity to Neijiang City. Newly built hospitals, schools, and shops are springing up around the city. The city's population has increased by one-eighth in the past three years. Market sales are increasing year after year. According to a survey by the Municipal People's Committee, the purchasing power of urban and rural residents here has increased by 45% this year compared to 1952, and by 23% compared to last year.

In addition to the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway passing through here, the Neijiang-Kunming Railway, which connects Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou, also began laying tracks in early November. This railway will make Neijiang City a transportation hub. The local leadership is studying the next stage of development for this "Sugar City." Soon, the people of the entire nation will receive more and better cane sugar and cane sugar by-products from here.

### 糖城——内江

    糖城——内江
    新华社记者　刘宗棠
    被人称作“糖城”的四川省内江市，现在又到了一年一度的榨糖季节。一片绿色的甘蔗林包围着的这座城市，郊区和邻近各县已经组织起来的蔗农，今年获得了解放以来最丰盛的收获，他们正在用木船、架子车和特制的背架，络绎不绝地向糖厂运送甘蔗。巨大的糖厂一面吞下整车整船的甘蔗，一面制造出成千成万斤的蔗糖。这些蔗糖又立即被装上火车，然后分散到省内外各地。内江市今年运出的新糖已有一千多吨。
    内江市1952年出产五千四百多吨蔗糖，去年蔗糖产量增加到二万三千多吨。但是去年这时候，这里的蔗糖主要还是依靠六十八座土糖坊生产，蔗汁是用水牛拖石磙的办法取得的。今年这里的蔗糖已经全部由机器制造了。新建的四川省最大的内江糖厂，每天能压榨甘蔗一千二百吨，生产能力比过去全部土糖坊还要大，而制糖过程所用的时间只有土糖坊的六分之一，每榨一吨甘蔗还能多出一百公斤蔗糖。另外，两座半机械化糖厂也增添了机器设备。
    榨糖工业的发展给内江市带来空前的繁荣。新建的医院、学校、商店在城市四周矗立起来。市内人口在最近三年内增加了八分之一。市场的商品销售额年年都在增加。据市人民委员会的调查，这里城乡人民的购买力今年比1952年增长45％，比去年增长23％。
    除了成渝铁路通过这里以外，由这里通往昆明的内昆铁路，11月初也开始铺轨了。这条铁路将使内江市成为联结四川、云南、贵州的枢纽。这里的领导机构正在研究这座“糖城”的下一步发展前景。不久，全国人民将从这里得到更多更好的蔗糖和蔗糖副产品。（附图片）
