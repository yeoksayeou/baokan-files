    Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 19th November. Shandong Province has achieved an unprecedented peanut harvest this year.
    According to calculations by the Shandong Provincial Department of Agriculture, the total output of peanuts from the province's 11,590,000 mu of land is expected to reach 2,771 million jin (peanut fruit, same below). This is not only nearly 30% higher than the highest historical output in 1954 but also exceeds the 1957 planned target by over 110 million jin.
    This year, agricultural cooperatives in Shandong Province, while ensuring that grain and cotton production were not affected, appropriately expanded the peanut planting area. They also focused on implementing many production reform measures to increase yield per unit area. As early as last winter, agricultural cooperatives in mountainous and hilly areas carried out large-scale soil improvement, deepening the soil layer by deep plowing and deep hoeing on millions of mu of thin mountain land. This year, over 7 million mu of peanuts were sown with seeds treated with peanut rhizobium inoculant, more than in any previous year. This alone can increase the yield of peanuts by about 15% per mu. Many areas have also widely promoted yield-increasing experiences such as early sowing, intercropping peanuts in wheat fields, and close planting. During the peanut growing season, agricultural cooperatives in various regions also carried out more timely and meticulous management work than in previous years in terms of inter-row hoeing and weeding, topdressing, and earthing up and vine pressing (to allow the fruit cones to enter the soil early). Therefore, this year the yield per mu of peanuts in the province reached 239 jin, an increase of 15% compared to last year.

    山东花生丰收
    据新华社济南19日电　山东省的花生今年获得空前丰收。
    据山东省农业厅计算，今年全省的一千一百五十九万亩花生，总产量可达二十七亿七千一百多万斤（花生果、下同），不仅比历史上产量最高的1954年增产近30％，而且超过了1957年的计划指标一亿一千多万斤。
    山东省各地的农业社，今年除了在不影响粮、棉生产的前提下，适当扩大了花生种植面积外，着重进行了许多提高单位面积产量的生产改革措施。早在去年冬季，山区和丘陵地区的农业社，就大规模地进行了改良土壤，使得上百万亩山岭薄地在经过深翻、深刨后加厚了土层。今年全省用花生根瘤菌拌种播种的花生达七百多万亩，比以往任何一年都要多，仅这一项，就可以使每亩花生的产量提高15％左右。许多地区还普遍推广了早种、在麦田里套种花生和密植等项增产经验。在花生生长期，各地农业社对花生田的中耕锄草、追肥和培土压蔓（使果锥早日入土）等项管理工作也比往年作的适时、细致。因此，今年全省花生的单位面积产量达到二百三十九斤，比去年增产一成半。
