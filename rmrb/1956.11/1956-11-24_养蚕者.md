    Silkworm Raiser
    By Our Correspondent Chen Yongjin
    The rain was pouring down. The Youth Farm's director was talking with me in the hallway when suddenly a girl came in from outside. She was barefoot, carrying two baskets of castor leaves, climbing the steps with difficulty. The director told me that this was Huang Qunxia, the silkworm-raising girl from their farm. The director also said that these days the silkworms were spinning cocoons and eating a lot of leaves, so Huang Qunxia and Yang Huiru were very busy. It was already eleven o'clock, and she hadn't had breakfast yet. After putting down the leaves, she immediately went to the silkworm-raising room to feed the silkworms. The director led me to the silkworm-raising room. Basket after basket of large castor silkworms, some were climbing to the edge because they were hungry, and some were climbing to the back of the baskets. Silkworms about to spin cocoons were also crawling around looking for places to spin. Xiao Huang hurriedly took the silkworms that had crawled to the edge back to their original places, muttering:
    "Why are you so naughty? You've climbed to the edge again. What will I do if you fall?" Then she put the translucent silkworms on her ear and scratched them with her fingers, placing them on the large table over there, saying to Yang Huiru, "These are ready to work."
    Before me were so many baskets of silkworms. The blue, green, and milky white silkworms were truly beautiful. These castor silkworms were as big and thick as the bean worms in the northern bean fields. They were eating the leaves with a "swish, swish" sound. Xiao Huang's round, dark eyes carefully searched for the "naughty" silkworms, so that they could quickly eat the fat castor leaves. I asked Xiao Huang, "Why do you scratch the silkworms on your ear?" Xiao Huang immediately took two silkworms, put them on my ear, and scratched them with her fingers, saying:
    "See, this silkworm is making a 'chew, chew' sound, which means it's about to spin a cocoon; if it doesn't make a sound, it's not time to spin yet." Then she put the two silkworms that weren't ready to spin back in the basket to eat leaves; she put the silkworms that were ready to spin on the large table over there.
    On the large table were many, many silkworms spinning silk. The colorful silkworms shook their heads as they spun. I had never seen such a way to make silkworms spin cocoons. The silkworms covered the large table with a thick layer, like a layer of snow. Huang Qunxia said that this new method of making silkworms spin cocoons could reduce a lot of trouble. In this way, the silkworms would turn into pupae on the table in two days, and then the pupae could be collected together.
    Several girls came to the silkworm-raising room to help Xiao Huang and Yang Huiru get leaves and find silkworms that were ready to spin and put them on the table. At this time, a little girl came into the room, looking timidly at the silkworms in the baskets, and said to Xiao Huang:
    "Are you a foreigner, Xiao Huang?"
    Xiao Huang smiled and took a few silkworms and made a "hissing" sound behind the girl's head. The girl cried "ouch" and ran out. Could this girl, with her slightly yellow but particularly delicate face, not be a Yunnanese? I asked the director. The director said that Huang Qunxia had only recently returned to China. She was born in Vietnam and later worked in a shoe factory; when Hanoi was liberated, she heard news of the construction of her motherland every day, and she always wanted to return to her own country. Xiao Qunxia saved several months' salary, wrote a letter to her sister in Kunming, and followed an old man returning to China, traveling on foot from Hanoi back to her motherland. After walking for five days, Xiao Huang's feet were swollen, but she continued to walk. Xiao Huang arrived at the Honghe Bridge, and two soldiers guarding the border kindly asked her about her origins in Cantonese, and then said to her: Look at how our motherland is being built everywhere! It's great that you're back to participate in the construction of the motherland!
    Xiao Huang arrived in Kunming and stayed at her sister's house. Comrades from the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office came to ask her if she had any difficulties in life and whether she wanted to study. Because Xiao Huang couldn't speak Mandarin, she went to a remedial school. Three months later, Xiao Huang heard the news that young people were volunteering to reclaim wasteland in the border areas, and she firmly requested to join the youth reclamation team. Comrades from the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office said, "Reclaiming wasteland and farming is difficult, you can't go."
    "Since I'm going to reclaim wasteland, I'm not afraid of difficulties," Xiao Huang said.
    "There's '瘴气' (miasma) there, you can't go," her sister said.
    "If others aren't afraid, I'm not afraid. Many people are going!"
    Xiao Huang signed up and filled out a registration form. A few days later, the youth reclamation team really came to the Nujiang Dam. For the first two days of reclamation, her hands were full of blisters, so she wrapped her hands and dug the ground. Xiao Huang quickly got used to the wasteland reclamation life and became familiar with Mandarin. The leaders told her to go to the Baoshan Silkworm Training Class to study. Xiao Huang and Yang Huiru went to Baoshan to learn silkworm raising together. In the silkworm training class, the teacher was afraid that Xiao Huang would not understand the class, so he helped her in his spare time. At first, Xiao Huang was a little afraid of those insects, but later she touched them, picked some leaves to feed them, and gradually couldn't leave those little insects. Castor silkworms can be raised here in all four seasons, and they can spin cocoons in twenty-four days, or even eighteen days if they are raised well. Xiao Huang felt that her career was very important and that the future was broad.
    In mid-May, Xiao Huang and Yang Huiru returned from Baoshan with 20,000 silkworm eggs. On the day they returned, although they were very tired, they still ran to the fields to see if there were any castor trees, and investigated the situation of how much castor there was with the local people, recording everything in a small notebook. They asked the farm director for a room to raise silkworms. Although the room was so crowded, the farm director tried his best to meet their requirements.
    Five days later, the silkworms came out, as black as small ants. The silkworms grew bigger day by day, and changed from black to various colors. Xiao Huang and Yang Huiru brought leaves for them to eat every day when they came back from the coffee fields. The silkworms changed day by day, and basket after basket increased, filling a room. The silkworms ate more and more leaves, and when others were sleeping, the two of them had to go far away to collect leaves, wash them clean, and then feed the silkworms, because they were afraid that there would be ants on the castor leaves that would bite those little babies to death. Sure enough, when the silkworms grew to be fourteen days old, Xiao Huang and Yang Huiru came back from the fields and suddenly saw a long line of ants on the ground, and more than a hundred silkworms were bitten to death. This was really like ants biting their hearts. They caught them again and again, and also brought several kettles of boiling water and fiercely scalded the ants to death.
    After all, the silkworms spun cocoons in eighteen days as these two girls hoped. When the silkworms were about to spin cocoons, they ate so many leaves every day, as fiercely as cattle eating grass. The leaves on the nearby castor trees gradually became less and less, and they had to run to a farther place to collect them. No matter how hot the weather, no matter how heavy the rain, they had to collect enough castor leaves to feed the silkworms. Often, Xiao Huang and the two of them went out with baskets on their backs before dawn and didn't come back until noon. Whenever she was hungry, she would always think that their silkworms were also hungry.
    These two girls have their own lofty ideals. They want to plant castor trees all over the hillsides and feed many, many castor silkworms. The leaders told them to raise eight crops of silkworms a year here. From their short experience of raising silkworms, they proved that they could raise ten crops. Here, whether it is summer or winter, the silkworms always have green castor leaves to eat.

    养蚕者
    本报记者　陈勇进
    天下着滂沱大雨，青年农场的场长正和我在过道里谈话，忽然从外面进来一个姑娘，她光着脚板挑着两筐蓖麻叶子艰难地爬上台阶来。这姑娘头上戴着一顶草帽，身上披着用棕织成的蓑衣。场长对我说，这就是他们农场里的养蚕姑娘黄群虾。场长还说，这几天蚕正结茧，吃的叶子特别多，所以黄群虾和杨惠如非常忙。时间已是十一点钟了，她还没吃早饭。放下叶子马上就到养蚕的屋子里去喂蚕了。场长领我到养蚕的屋子里去，一箩箩的大蓖麻蚕，有的因为饿，爬到边边上来，有的爬到箩箩的背面来。要结茧的蚕也乱爬着找寻结茧的地方。小黄匆忙地把那爬到边边上的蚕拿到原来的地方去，嘴里还唠叨着说：
    “你怎么这样调皮呀？又爬到边边上来了，摔着你可叫我咋个办。”然后她又把那些身上透明的蚕放在耳朵上用手指挠几下，放在那边的大桌面上对杨惠如说：“这些都该做活了。”
    摆在我面前的是那么多箩箩蚕，那蓝色的，绿色的，乳白色的蚕实在美。这些蓖麻蚕，个儿大得像北方豆田里的大豆虫一样粗长。它们唰唰地吃着叶子。小黄那对又圆又黑的大眼睛，用心地找寻那“调皮”的蚕儿，使它能快快吃到那肥大的蓖麻叶子。我问小黄：“为什么把蚕放在耳朵上挠几下。”小黄马上拿了两个蚕放在我的耳朵上也用手指挠了几下说：
    “你看这蚕儿吃吃地响，就是要结茧了；这不响的是不到结茧的时候。”随后她把那两个不结茧的蚕放在筐里叫它吃叶子；又把那要结茧的蚕放在那边的大桌面上去。
    大桌面上，放着好多好多的吐丝的蚕。那多彩的蚕儿摇着头吐丝。我从来没见过这样叫蚕结茧的法儿。蚕把大桌面吐了厚厚的一层，像落了一层雪一样。这个使蚕结茧的新法儿，可以减少很多麻烦，黄群虾说，这样结茧蚕过两天就在桌面上变成了蛹，然后把蛹收在一块就可以了。
    养蚕的屋子里来了几个姑娘，帮助小黄和杨惠如拿叶子，找要结茧的蚕儿放在桌子上。这时有一个小姑娘进到屋里来，畏缩地看着箩箩上的蚕，向小黄说：
    “你是外国人吗小黄？”
    小黄笑着拿了几个蚕向着那个姑娘的脑后“嘶”了一声。那个姑娘哎呀一声跑了出去。这个面颊微黄而特别清秀的小群虾，难道不是云南人吗？我问场长，场长说黄群虾是不久以前才回国的。她从小就生在越南，后来大了又在一家鞋厂里当了工人；越南的国土河内解放了，她天天听到祖国的建设的消息，她时刻想回到自己的祖国。小群虾积了几个月的薪水，又给她在昆明的姐姐写了封信，就跟着一个回国的老人带伴儿从河内徒步回自己的祖国来。连着走了五天，小黄的脚也走肿了，她还继续走。小黄来到红河桥头，两个守卫国境的战士和悦地用广东话问了她的来历，然后对她说：你看看咱们祖国到处都在建设！你回来参加祖国建设太好啦！
    小黄来到昆明，住在她姐姐家。华侨事务处的同志来问她生活有什么困难，是否愿意学习，小黄因为不会说普通话就上了补习学校。三个月后，小黄听到青年们到边疆志愿垦荒的消息，她坚决地要求参加青年垦荒队。华侨事务处的同志说：“垦荒种田是困难事，你可不能去。”
    “既然去开荒就不怕困难。”小黄说。
    “那里有‘瘴气’，你可不能去。”小黄的姐姐说。
    “人家不怕我就不怕，去的人多啦！”
    小黄报了名又填了登记表。不几天青年垦荒队真的到怒江坝来了。开荒的头两天她手上全是血泡，她就把手包起来刨地。小黄很快地习惯了开荒生活，熟悉了普通话。领导上叫她到保山蚕训班去学习。小黄和杨惠如一块到保山学养蚕了。在蚕训班里老师怕小黄上课听不懂，在课余的时间帮助她。小黄起初看见那些虫虫有些害怕，后来摸摸它，摘些叶子喂喂它，慢慢地离不开那些小虫虫了。蓖麻蚕这里四季都可以养，二十四天就可结茧，养的好了十八天就可以结茧。小黄觉得她的事业很重要，前途广阔了。
    5月中旬，小黄和杨惠如从保山带着两万颗蚕籽回来了。回来的当天，虽然非常疲倦，却仍然跑到野地里看有没有蓖麻树，并且向当地的群众调查，把那里蓖麻多少的情形都记在小本本上。她们向场长要一间房子准备养蚕。虽然房子那么挤，场长还是尽量的来满足她们的要求。
    五天以后，蚕儿像小蚂蚁一样黑压压地出来了。蚕一天比一天大，并且由黑色变成各种颜色。小黄和杨惠如每天从咖啡田里回来的时候都带叶子给它们吃。蚕一天一个样儿，一箩箩又一箩箩地增加着，一个屋子满了。蚕吃的叶子多了，别人睡觉她俩要到老远的地方采叶子，洗干净再喂蚕，她们就怕蓖麻叶子上有蚂蚁咬死了那些小宝宝。果然在蚕儿长到十四天的时候，小黄和杨惠如从田里回来，突然看到地上长长的一队蚂蚁，一百多条蚕被咬死了。这真像蚂蚁咬她们的心。她们捉了又捉，还提了几壶开水狠命地把蚂蚁烫死了。
    蚕，毕竟按着这两个姑娘的希望在十八天就结茧了，蚕快结茧时，每天吃那么多叶子，真像黄牛吃草一样厉害。附近蓖麻树上的叶子慢慢吃得少了，她们要跑到更远一点的地方去采，不管天气多么热，不管雨下得怎样大，她们要采得足够的蓖麻叶子喂蚕儿，常常是天不明小黄她们俩个就背着箩箩出去了，到中午才回来。每当她肚子饿的时候，总会想起她们的蚕儿也饿了。
    这两个姑娘有她们远大的理想，她们想把这满山坡坡上都种上蓖麻树，喂上很多很多的蓖麻蚕。领导上叫她们在这里一年养八季蚕，她们从短短的养蚕经验里证明：可以养十季。这里不管夏天或冬天，蚕儿总有青青的蓖麻叶子吃。
