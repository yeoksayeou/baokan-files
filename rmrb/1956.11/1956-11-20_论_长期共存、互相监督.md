On "Long-Term Coexistence and Mutual Supervision"

Standing Committee Member of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League

    The proposal of the principle of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" between the Communist Party and the democratic parties has aroused great interest and attention from all sides. This principle, like the principle of "letting a hundred flowers bloom" in academic thought, stems from the same spirit and serves the same purpose. This same spirit is to further promote the people's democracy and freedom to the fullest extent; this same purpose is to mobilize all forces to serve the cause of socialist construction. If "letting a hundred flowers bloom" means a higher elevation of academic thought and freedom of speech under our people's democratic system, then "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" means a higher stage of development of political democracy within the people. The implementation of these two principles is the best way to mobilize all forces and give full play to their enthusiasm and creativity to continuously promote socialist construction.
    Perhaps some people say that the Communist Party of China, with over 10 million members, is the core of leadership of our country and all undertakings, and it possesses incomparably powerful and overwhelming material and spiritual strength, while the number of members of the democratic parties is much smaller, and their strength is far inferior. Under such a power comparison, talking about long-term coexistence and mutual supervision is probably a tactic of the Communist Party, right? Allowing the various parties to exist for a long time is probably just a democratic formality, right?
    We say no, such doubts are completely unfounded.
    This is absolutely not a tactic, but one of the fundamental principles consistently followed by the Communist Party over a long period of time. This principle is a concrete manifestation of the Party's united front thought under new historical conditions, and its theoretical basis is Chairman Mao's following instructions: "The Communist Party's principle of democratic cooperation with non-Party members is fixed and will never change. As long as there are parties in society, the number of people joining the Party will always be a minority, and the number of people outside the Party will always be the majority, so Party members must always cooperate with people outside the Party." "Communist Party members only have the obligation to practice democratic cooperation with non-Party members, and have no right to exclude others or monopolize everything." "Communist Party members must listen to the opinions of non-Party members and give others the opportunity to speak." Recently, Chairman Mao also said in his opening speech at the "Eighth National Congress": "Although we have more than 10 million Party members, they still account for only a very small number of the country's population. In our various state organs and social undertakings, a large amount of work must rely on non-Party personnel. If we are not good at relying on the masses of the people and not good at cooperating with non-Party personnel, then we will not be able to do our work well." The strength of the Communist Party does not mean that it does not need to be supervised by anyone. On the contrary, the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao have repeatedly and frequently emphasized that the Party and every Party member should be placed under the supervision of the masses of the people. Close ties with the masses—the source of the Party's invincible power, the source of its forever vigorous vitality—its significance is not limited to educating and guiding the masses, but first of all lies in listening to the opinions and voices of the masses, learning from the masses, and accepting the supervision of the masses. One must first "come from the masses" before one can "go to the masses"; if one does not listen to the opinions and voices of the masses, and does not understand the situation and demands of the masses, there will be no "come from the masses," and without "come from the masses," it will be impossible to correctly "go to the masses," or one can only "go to the masses" subjectively, that is to say, there can be no correct leadership. Therefore, the reason why the Communist Party has incomparably powerful strength and infinite vitality is precisely because it is the party that is best at caring for the interests of the masses, listening to the opinions of the masses, and accepting the supervision of the masses among all political parties. Therefore, it is completely unfounded to think that the Communist Party's proposal of mutual supervision with the democratic parties is playing a tactic.
    From the perspective of the democratic parties, their current membership is indeed much smaller than that of the Communist Party, but they have a characteristic in their organizational principles that is different from the Communist Party, that is, they themselves are political organizations with the nature of a united front, and most of their members are representative figures from various aspects and departments. Most of them can represent and influence a part of the masses in the social strata or work departments they are in contact with, and some upper-level democratic figures can even influence a very wide range of masses. Therefore, the people who supervise the Communist Party and the People's Government through the democratic parties are not limited to their members, but also include the vast people of all strata and aspects they represent and are connected with, who are several times, dozens of times, or even hundreds of times more than their members. Therefore, the slogan of "mutual supervision" essentially refers not only to the relationship between the Party and the democratic parties, but also to the relationship between the entire Party and non-Party members (including people's organizations, non-party democratic personages, etc.). Moreover, the organizational situation of the democratic parties is not stagnant. Under the encouragement of this new principle and the new situation of socialist revolution and construction, they are actively展开活动、发展组织展開活动、发展组织. Therefore, it is even more extremely wrong to think that the long-term existence of democratic parties is merely a formality.
    The principle of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" is neither a tactic nor a formality. It is a major principle with profound theoretical significance. "Long-term coexistence" means that a multi-party system is implemented not only during the transition period, but also under the socialist social system. "Mutual supervision" means overcoming contradictions and difficulties through the exposure of contradictions and through struggle (criticism, suggestions), so that the various undertakings of our country can be continuously improved and accelerated. The meaning of the slogan "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" is that throughout the entire socialist historical period, our country will implement a multi-party system for mutual supervision for a long time, in order to achieve mutual supplementation, mutual education, timely exposure of shortcomings, and correction of mistakes, so as to manage our country better and build it faster.
    As everyone knows, the people's democratic dictatorship is essentially the proletarian dictatorship. Marx had clear instructions early on, saying that the state in the transition period from capitalism to socialism cannot be anything other than the revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat. What is the proletarian dictatorship? The essence of the proletarian dictatorship is the leadership of the working class (through the Communist Party) over all state affairs, the ruthless suppression of the overthrown enemies of the people, the socialist transformation of hundreds of millions of peasants and small producers, the transformation of them from small private owners into socialist builders, the transformation of private ownership of the means of production into socialist public ownership, and the elimination of capitalism and any other forms of exploitation, and the elimination of class antagonism. In our country, these things are being realized one by one, and decisive victories have been achieved, and they will be completely and thoroughly realized in the near future. Therefore, the essence of our country's people's democratic system today is the proletarian dictatorship, which is beyond doubt. However, in the Soviet Union, the only socialist country on Earth before World War II, the proletarian dictatorship there has always been embodied in the form of a one-party system since its existence. This is because some of the parties that existed in the Soviet Union before the October Revolution were either counter-revolutionary in nature, or degenerated into counter-revolutionaries in the course of the revolution; therefore, in the Soviet Union, the Bolshevik Communist Party became the only political party, which was the result of the special historical development of the Soviet Union. We must never conclude from this that a one-party system is the only form to embody the proletarian dictatorship. Still less can it be said that the proletarian dictatorship is the one-party dictatorship of the Communist Party, because the proletarian dictatorship does not require (and must not require) the proletariat alone as a class or the Communist Party alone to take care of state affairs. On the contrary, it requires precisely that under the strong leadership of the proletariat over the state organs, it forms an alliance with the broad masses of non-proletarian people, and absorbs and leads them to actively participate in the work of the state power. Without this, it would be impossible to complete the historical task of the proletarian dictatorship. Due to the special historical conditions of our country's revolution, due to the fact that our country's democratic parties have been cooperating with the Communist Party and actively participating in the democratic revolutionary struggle for more than ten years before liberation, and have made many contributions; after liberation, under the leadership of the Communist Party, they have also played an active role in the country's economic recovery, democratic reforms, socialist transformation and construction, as well as in the struggle against domestic and foreign enemies and the struggle for lasting world peace. They have not only played an important role in uniting and mobilizing all positive forces, but also played a very good role in mutual supervision. The experience of the past seven years has proved that through the democratic parties, non-party democratic personages and people's organizations, and through the People's Political Consultative Conference, which is mainly composed of members of various parties and groups, consultations and debates are held on the formulation of the state's policy program, constitution, policies, laws, plans, etc., criticisms, inquiries, inspections and visits are conducted on their implementation and the work of various departments, investigations, exposures or reports are made on the phenomena of cadres violating laws and regulations, and the opinions, requirements and suggestions of the masses are frequently reflected. All of this is indeed of great help in promoting the strengthening of Party and government leadership, the improvement of various tasks, and the consolidation of the people's democratic dictatorship. Such a groundbreaking, arduous and complex historical task as the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce has achieved a decisive victory with the assistance of the Minjian Association, the Federation of Industry and Commerce, and other relevant organizations (of course, mainly due to the leadership of the Party). Similarly, the ideological transformation of intellectuals and the implementation of the Party's policies and measures on the issue of intellectuals have also achieved remarkable achievements with the assistance of the Democratic League, the Jiusan Society, and other democratic parties, as well as the Educational Union, the Science Association, and other relevant organizations. And the Political Consultative Conference, as a united front organizational form of parties, groups, and non-party democratic personages, has undeniably played a powerful role of mutual supervision in a series of social democratic reforms since liberation and in all undertakings of socialist transformation and socialist construction.
    From this, it can be seen that the people's democracy under the multi-party system led by the Communist Party, which embodies the essence of the proletarian dictatorship, is a system that is superior to the one-party system according to our country's specific conditions. Implementing socialist democracy through a multi-party system can be done more deeply, more meticulously, and more comprehensively than with a one-party system. Moreover, the principle of "long-term coexistence" means that our country's multi-party system can not only play a good role in the current transition period, but will also continue to play its active role in the period after the future socialist society is built. In a socialist society, since the exploitation of man by man has been eradicated, the class divide has been eliminated, and the broad masses of people throughout the country have achieved a high degree of political and spiritual-moral unity, it is not only fully possible to highly promote democracy within the people, but it has also become a completely necessary thing. Only by fully promoting socialist democracy can the enthusiasm and creativity of the people be brought into full play, the country's construction cause can be done faster and better, and the strength of Party and government leadership can become incomparably stronger.

    论“长期共存、互相监督”
    中国民主同盟中央常务委员
    中国民主同盟上海市委员会主任委员  沈志远
    共产党和民主党派“长期共存、互相监督”这一方针的提出，引起了各方面高度的兴趣和重视。这个方针和学术思想上“百家争鸣”的方针一样，是从同一精神出发、为同一个目的服务的。这同一精神就是要进一步地来充分发扬人民的民主自由；这同一目的就是要调动一切力量来为社会主义建设事业服务。假使说“百家争鸣”是意味着我国人民民主制度下学术思想和言论自由的更高度的昂扬，那末“长期共存、互相监督”就意味着人民内部政治民主的更高的发展阶段。这两个方针的贯彻执行，是调动各方面的力量、充分发挥其积极性和创造性来不断推进社会主义建设的最好办法。
    或许有人说，拥有一千多万党员的中国共产党，是我们国家和一切事业的领导核心，它具有强大无比、压倒一切的物质和精神力量，而民主党派的成员数目要少得多，它们的力量差得太远，在这样的力量对比之下来谈长期共存、互相监督，恐怕是共产党的一种策略吧？让各党派长期存在，恐怕是民主形式的点缀吧？
    我们说不，这样的怀疑是完全没有根据的。
    这绝对不是策略，而是中国共产党长时期来一贯奉行的根本原则之一。这个方针是党的统一战线思想在新的历史条件下的具体化，它的理论根据就是毛主席的如下的指示：“共产党的这个同党外人士实行民主合作的原则，是固定不移的，是永远不变的。只要社会上还有党存在，加入党的人总是少数，党外的人总是多数，所以党员总是要和党外的人合作”。“共产党员只有对党外人士实行民主合作的义务，而无排斥别人、垄断一切的权利”。“共产党员必须倾听党外人士的意见，给别人以说话的机会。”最近毛主席在“八大”的开幕词中又说：“虽然我们有一千多万党员，但是在全国人口中仍然只占极少数。在我们的各个国家机关和各项社会事业中，大量的工作要依靠党外的人员来作。如果我们不善于依靠人民群众，不善于同党外的人员合作，那就无法把工作做好。”共产党力量的强大并不等于它就无需乎受任何人的监督，相反的，党中央和毛主席是一再地、经常地强调着要把党和每一党员置于人民群众的监督之下。密切联系群众——这一党的战无不胜，攻无不克的威力的泉源，它的永远朝气蓬勃的生命力的源泉，其意义不只限于教育群众、指导群众，而首先在于倾听群众的意见和呼声，向群众学习，接受群众的监督。必先“从群众中来”，然后才能“到群众中去”；若不倾听群众的意见和呼声，不了解群众的情况和要求，就没有了“从群众中来”，既没有了“从群众中来”，那就不可能很正确地“到群众中去”，或只能主观主义地“到群众中去”，也就是说，不可能有正确的领导。因此，共产党之所以具有无比强大的力量和无限旺盛的生命力，正是由于它是一切政党中最善于关心群众的利益、倾听群众的意见、接受群众的监督的一个党。因此，认为共产党提出与民主党派互相监督的口号是玩策略，那是完全没有根据的。
    再从民主党派方面来说，目前它们的成员数量确是比共产党少得多，但是它们在组织原则上有着一个和共产党不同的特点，那就是它们本身是具有统一战线性质的政治团体，它们的大多数成员是各方面、各部门的代表性人士，他们中多数在各自所接触的社会阶层或工作部门内能够代表和影响一部分群众，有些上层民主人士甚至能影响到很广大的群众。因此，通过各民主党派来对共产党和人民政府实行监督的人，并不限于它们的成员，还有比它们的成员多几倍几十倍乃至成百倍的它们所代表、所联系的各阶层各方面的广大人民。因此，“互相监督”这一口号实质上不只是指党与民主党派的相互关系，而且是指整个的党与非党（包括人民团体、无党派民主人士等）的关系而言的。何况各民主党派的组织情况也不是停滞不变的，它们在这个新的方针和社会主义革命和建设的新形势的鼓舞之下，正在积极展开活动、发展组织呢！因此，认为民主党派的长期存在不过是一种形式上的点缀，更是极端错误的看法。
    “长期共存、互相监督”的方针，既非什么策略，更非形式上的点缀，它是具有深刻的理论原则意义的一项重大方针。“长期共存”意味着不仅在过渡时期，而且在社会主义社会制度下实行多党制。“互相监督”意味着通过矛盾的揭发、通过斗争（批评、提意见）来克服矛盾、克服困难，使我们国家的各项事业不断地改进和加速地发展。“长期共存、互相监督”这口号的意思就是说在整个社会主义历史时期内，我国将长期实行多党制来进行互相监督，以达到互相补充、互相教育、及时暴露缺点、纠正错误，以便把我们的国家管理得更好，建设得更快。
    大家知道，人民民主专政本质上就是无产阶级专政。马克思早就有过明确的指示，他说从资本主义到社会主义中间的过渡时期的国家，除了无产阶级的革命专政以外，不能是任何别的东西。什么是无产阶级专政呢？无产阶级专政的实质就是工人阶级（通过共产党）对全部国家事务的领导，对被推翻的人民敌人实行无情的镇压，对亿万农民小生产者实行社会主义改造，把他们从小私有者改造成为社会主义的建设者，把生产资料的私人所有制改变为社会主义公有制，消灭资本主义和其他任何形式的剥削制度，消灭阶级对立。在我国，这些事情都在一一实现中，且已获得了决定性的胜利，在不远的将来就要全部彻底实现了。所以今天我国的人民民主制度的本质就是无产阶级专政，这是无可怀疑的。可是在第二次世界大战以前地球上唯一的社会主义国家苏联，从其存在的第一天起，那里的无产阶级专政就一直是采取一党制的形式来体现的。这是因为苏联在十月革命前存在过的一些党派，或者本来就是反革命，或者在革命过程中蜕化成为反革命；因此在苏联，布尔塞维克共产党成为唯一的政党，是苏联特殊的历史发展的结果。我们决不能由此得出结论，说一党制是体现无产阶级专政的唯一形式。更不能说，无产阶级专政就是共产党一党专政，因为无产阶级专政并不要求（也必不可要求）无产阶级一个阶级或共产党一党来包办国事，相反的，恰恰是要求在无产阶级对国家机关的坚强领导下与非无产阶级的广大人民群众结成联盟，并吸收和领导他们来积极参加国家政权工作。不这样就根本无法完成无产阶级专政的历史任务。由于我国革命的特殊历史条件，由于解放以前的十余年间，我国各民主党派一直与共产党合作，积极参加民主革命斗争，作出了很多的贡献；解放以后，它们又在共产党的领导下，对于国家的经济恢复、民主改革、社会主义的改造和建设，以及对内外敌人的斗争和争取世界持久和平的斗争，都发挥了积极的作用。它们不但在团结和动员一切积极力量方面起了重要的作用，而且在相互监督方面也起了很好的作用。七年来的经验证明，通过各民主党派、无党派民主人士和各人民团体，通过以各党派和团体成员为主要成分的人民政治协商会议，就国家的施政纲领、宪法、政策、法令、计划等等的制定进行协商和辩论，对它们的执行情况和各部门的工作进行了批评、质询、检查和视察，对干部违法乱纪的现象进行了调查、揭发或检举，并经常反映群众的意见、要求和建议，这一切对于促进党政领导的加强，各项工作的改进和人民民主专政的巩固，确是有很大帮助的。像资本主义工商业的社会主义改造这样一项破天荒的艰巨复杂的历史任务，是在民建会、工商联及其他有关组织的协助之下取得决定性胜利的（当然主要是由于党的领导）。像知识分子的思想改造和党对知识分子问题的政策措施的贯彻执行，也是在民主同盟、九三学社及其他民主党派和教育工会、科联及其他有关组织的协助之下获得了显著成就的。而作为党派、团体及无党派民主人士的统一战线组织形式的政治协商会议，则在解放以来一系列的社会民主改革中，在社会主义改造和社会主义建设的一切事业中，无可争辩地都起了有力的相互监督作用。
    由此可见，体现无产阶级专政本质的以共产党为领导的多党制下的人民民主，依据我国的具体情况来说，是比一党制有更大的优越性的制度；通过多党制来贯彻社会主义民主，是可以比一党制做得更加深入、更加细致和更加全面的。而且“长期共存”的方针是意味着我国的多党制不但在目前的过渡时期能起好作用，而且在将来社会主义社会建成后的时期还要继续发挥它们的积极作用。在社会主义社会，由于人对人的剥削已经根除，阶级的鸿沟已经消灭，全国广大人民已经具备了政治上和精神道义上的高度一致性，高度发扬人民内部的民主就不但有了充分的可能性，而且还成为完全必要的事了。只有充分地发扬社会主义民主，才能最充分地发挥人民的积极性和创造性，国家的建设事业才能办得更快更好，党政领导的力量才能更加变得无比的坚强。
