    Unnecessary "Matching Social Status"
    Tang Tao

    This thought came to me after reading Comrade Yan Xiu's "A Good Thing" (October 24th issue). Unfortunately, what I thought of was not "another good thing."

    However, I must quickly declare: I fully support Comrade Yan Xiu's praise. In recent years, the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission has been dispersing national sports competitions to various locations, which indeed represents a new working spirit. Not only does it have the many advantages listed by Comrade Yan Xiu, but I also believe that the rapid progress in China's sports achievements in recent years is inseparable from this spirit. This spirit shows that the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission is indeed thinking about sports and serving athletes, rather than just thinking about its own "bureaucracy." I believe that any organization that can forget about "bureaucracy" and truly approach the masses from the perspective of work will easily gain the understanding and support of the masses, integrate with the masses, and ultimately benefit the work. These measures of the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission are "deeply rooted in the hearts of the people," so it can do well and achieve results.

    At least that's how I personally feel.

    This made me think of the work of the Shanghai Municipal Sports Commission. They are also carrying out a kind of "dispersion," and I do not object to all regions learning the spirit of the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission in approaching the masses, but their "dispersion" is a bit ridiculous. Perhaps because scholars are too unskilled in martial arts and they must first start their propaganda in the "frail" ranks, they are always stuck behind the literati. For example, there is Hongkou Park in Shanghai, which was originally a place for people to visit and stroll. Recently, we also moved Mr. Lu Xun's tomb here. However, the Sports Commission demarcated a corner of the park and built a large stadium, so that people, while lingering in admiration, are filled with the loud shouts of tens of thousands of people, and Mr. Lu Xun is also spared the feeling of "loneliness in the underworld"; another example is the Cultural Club in Shanghai, which was originally a place for people to rest, chat, listen to music, and watch performances. The Sports Commission demarcated a large lawn in front and established a sports training ground, so that people, while holding arms and whispering, constantly "enjoy" the commands from the loudspeaker outside the window; another example is the People's Park in Shanghai, where the city's largest library and museum are located, which was originally a place for people to visit and read. Recently, the Sports Commission has rebuilt the other end of the same building into a gymnasium, and I don't know what kind of sounds people will hear when they are fully engaged in visiting and concentrating on reading.

    Since ancient times, literature and martial arts have been mentioned together, but in practical work, I always feel that there is no need for a "God of Literature" on the left and a "Sage of Martial Arts" on the right, arranged in such a "matching social status," because their working methods are different, and the required environment is also different. Comrades of the Sports Commission may say that building the stadium and training ground came first, and moving Lu Xun's tomb and changing the Cultural Club came later, it wasn't martial arts pinning down literature, but literature forcing martial arts. I must point out here that although Lu Xun's tomb was only moved recently, the proposal was made several years ago; although the Cultural Club was renamed later, it was originally a club, and all the house styles and internal facilities show that it was a club. The comrades in charge of sports work not only knew this, but some people also raised objections at the time. So, why couldn't a comprehensive consideration be made?

    Rebuilding the other end of the same building of the library and museum into a gymnasium shows where the problem lies.

    I do not advocate "laying down arms and pursuing literature," on the contrary, I wholeheartedly support and love sports work, but I oppose unnecessary "matching social status," and I think this kind of "literary and martial arts double act" need not be performed any longer, for the sake of our "literary affairs," and also for the sake of our "martial arts."

    不必要的“门当户对”
    唐弢
    这是看了严秀同志的“一件好事”（10月24日本版）才想起来的，不幸我所想到的却并不是“另一件好事”。
    不过我得赶紧声明：区区是完全拥护严秀同志的表扬的。中央体育运动委员会几年来一直把全国性体育比赛分散到各地举行，的确代表了一种新的工作精神，不但有严秀同志所列举的许多好处，我还以为近年来我国体育成绩的突飞猛晋，是和这种精神分不开的。这种精神说明全国体委的确是在为体育着想，为运动员服务，而不是只想到它自己的“衙门”。我以为任何机关，能够忘记“衙门”，真正从工作出发去接近群众，便容易得到群众的了解和拥护，和群众打成一片，结果也就对工作有好处。全国体委的这些措施就因为“深得人心”，所以它能够做得好，做得有成绩。
    至少我个人是这样体会的。
    我因此又想到上海市体育运动委员会的工作，他们也在进行一种“分散”，我并不反对各地都能学习全国体委接近群众的精神，可是他们实在“分散”得有点使人啼笑不得。也许因为书生太不尚武，必须首先在“弱不禁风”的队伍里展开宣传吧，所以总是钉住在文人的后面。譬如说：上海有一个虹口公园，这原是供人游览散步的所在，最近我们还把鲁迅先生的墓迁在这里面，体委却划去公园的一角，建筑了一个大运动场，使人于低徊景仰之余，饱听上万群众的高呼大叫，而鲁迅先生也得免“泉下寂寞”之感；又譬如：上海有一个文化俱乐部，这原是供人休息、谈心、听音乐、看表演的所在，体委又划去前面的一块大草地，建立了体育锻炼场，使人于把臂捉膝，低诉微吟之间，又不断“欣赏”从窗外传来大喇叭里的口令；再譬如：上海有一个人民公园，全市最大的图书馆、博物馆都在里面，这原是供人参观阅览的所在，最近体委又把同一座大楼的另一端改建体育馆，我还不知道人们在全神参观、专心阅读的时候，将会听到什么样的声音。
    自来文武连称，但在实际工作上，我总觉得无需乎左一个“文昌”，右一个“武圣”，安排得这样“门当户对”，因为他们的工作方式有别，所要求的环境也就不一样。体委的同志们也许会说，建运动场、锻炼场在先，迁鲁迅墓改文化俱乐部在后，不是武钉文，倒是文逼武。我在这里必须指出：鲁迅墓虽然是最近才迁去的，但动议却远在几年之前；文化俱乐部虽然是后来改称的，但这里原来也是一个俱乐部，一切房屋式样、内部设备都说明着它是俱乐部。负责体育工作的同志不但知道，而且当时还有人提过意见，那么，为什么不能作一个全面的考虑呢？
    从图书馆、博物馆同一座大楼的另一端再建体育馆这一点，是可以看出问题的所在的。
    我并不主张“偃武修文”，相反地，我是竭诚拥护而且爱好体育工作的，但我反对不必要的“门当户对”，以为这种“文武双档”的戏可以不必再唱下去，为了我们的“文事”，也为了我们的“武功”。
