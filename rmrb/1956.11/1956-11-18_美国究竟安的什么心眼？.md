    What exactly is the United States up to?
    The U.S. President said at a press conference on the 14th that the United States would do its best to oppose volunteer personnel from China, the Soviet Union, and other countries from entering the Middle East to support Egypt in resisting aggression. He revealed that the United States is also preparing to create a resolution in the United Nations to oppose any volunteer army supporting Egypt.
    Everyone knows that Britain, France, and Israel are the arsonists who launched an armed invasion of Egypt and undermined peace in the Middle East; the people and governments of all countries who support Egypt in resisting aggression are the firefighters preventing the spread of war in the Middle East. Now, although Britain, France, and Israel have been forced to accept a ceasefire, they are still unwilling to immediately withdraw their invading troops from Egypt in accordance with Egypt's demands and the resolutions of the United Nations General Assembly emergency meeting, and are still regrouping their forces, preparing to play with fire again. The United States, as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council with major responsibility for world peace, and also as a country that voted in favor of the United Nations resolution, does not oppose the arsonists who undermine peace in the Middle East, nor does it urge Britain, France, and Israel to immediately implement the United Nations' troop withdrawal proposal; instead, it turns around and shouts loudly to "oppose" the firefighters who maintain peace in the Middle East. What exactly is it up to?
    The U.S. President's remarks show that the U.S. election has just passed, and after the Republican government has obtained the votes, this U.S. government, which once verbally opposed the British and French attack on Egypt, immediately wants to openly discard its "peaceful" disguise and play with fire with the arsonists. (True)

### 美国究竟安的什么心眼？

    美国究竟安的什么心眼？
    美国总统14日在记者招待会上说，美国将尽力反对中苏等国支援埃及反抗侵略的志愿人员进入中东。他透露，美国还准备在联合国搞出一个反对任何志愿军支援埃及的决议。
    谁都知道，英、法和以色列是武装侵略埃及、破坏中东和平的纵火者；支援埃及反抗侵略的各国人民和政府，是防止中东战火蔓延的救火者。现在、英、法和以色列虽然已经被迫接受停火，可是仍不肯按照埃及的要求和联合国大会紧急会议的决议立即从埃及撤退侵略军队，并且还在重新集结兵力，准备再度玩火，美国作为一个对世界和平负有重大责任的联合国安全理事会常任理事国之一，而且也是联合国决议的赞成国之一，可是它不去反对破坏中东和平的纵火者，不督促英法和以色列立即执行联合国的撤兵建议；反而回过头来，大喊大叫要“反对”维护中东和平的救火者。它究竟是安的什么心眼呢？
    美国总统的谈话说明，美国的大选刚刚过去，共和党政府在把选票捞到手之后，这个曾经以在口头上反对英法进攻埃及的美国政府，马上就想要公开抛弃“和平”的外衣，同纵火犯一道玩火了。    （真）
