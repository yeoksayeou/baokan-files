    新华社29日讯　据捷克斯洛伐克通讯社报道：捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会和捷克斯洛伐克共和国政府28日作出了1953年以来第六次降低消费品、特别是食品的零售价格的决定。
    这个决定将从今年12月3日起实行。
    由于这一次降低物价，捷克斯洛伐克居民每年将得到十四亿克朗的利益。
    在食品方面，零售价格降低了3.2％到45％以上。如大米和豆类平均减价五分之一，肉制品减价25％，牛乳减价8.6％等。工业消费品的零售价格降低了9.5％到35.5％不等。如照相器材减价约三分之一，无线电收音机减价约五分之一，摩托车减价25％等。
    由于这一次减价的都是最必需的商品，因此，这次降低物价对提高捷克斯洛伐克居民的生活水平的影响比以前任何一次都要大。
