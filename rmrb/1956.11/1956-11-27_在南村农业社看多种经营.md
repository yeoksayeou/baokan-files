    Seeing Diversified Economy in Nancun Agricultural Cooperative
    Huang Yubai
    In October, as soon as I arrived at the Nancun Agricultural Cooperative in Xiangtan County, Hunan, I saw small trees forming forests on the round hills, with not a speck of barren land. A large expanse of late rice paddy fields along the river was ripening, displaying a scene of abundant harvest. To the south, the cooperative's brick kiln, just sealed after firing, and two earthenware pot kilns were being loaded. Diagonally opposite the earthenware pot kilns, across the hill ditch, was the cooperative's pig farm. A total of thirty-two pigs, large and small, were raised here. Among them, sixteen piglets were recently born to three sows, and eight more sows were about to give birth. Cooperative cadre Lao Tan, while talking to us about future production plans, guided us to visit the cooperative's sideline production. Later, we also went to the home of Guo Shaocheng, a cooperative member with the most chickens.

    Guo Shaocheng hatched forty-five chickens, large and small, from four old hens. Now, four or five chickens lay eggs every day. Guo Shaocheng smiled and said to us, "With this, I have long had enough money for oil and salt." After he finished speaking, he added, "Even the chicken manure can yield two dan next year, which can be exchanged for two dan of grain." I asked Lao Tan about the general sideline production of cooperative members. Lao Tan thought for a moment and said quite positively, "Each family has an average of about ten chickens, one pig, enough vegetables to eat, and other ways to earn money. Even Zhu Tan, a "Five Guarantee Household" over seventy years old, raises three chickens himself and grows more than one fen of vegetables. He can't finish eating his vegetables himself and even gives them away."

    How did this cooperative do so well in sideline production? To understand this, we also visited the cooperative director. The Nancun Cooperative was upgraded from a primary cooperative to a advanced cooperative in January this year. During the spring plowing season, the province and county called for achieving a thousand-jin yield, and the Nancun Cooperative also set a plan to expand double-cropping rice by 100%. At that time, the cooperative members were very enthusiastic, always thinking about how to use one mu of land as two mu of land. All the cooperative's strength was concentrated on agricultural production. In April, the county committee held a meeting, criticized the single-minded focus on agriculture, and advocated developing more sideline occupations. When the cooperative initially discussed engaging in sideline production, some cooperative cadres said: Since it is an advanced cooperative, sideline production should also be carried out uniformly by the cooperative to resemble doing socialism. If cooperative members are allowed to engage in sideline occupations on their own, they will reduce their work in the cooperative, and put some fertilizer in their own fields, which will affect the cooperative's production. The cooperative director also thought this way at the time: If we want to do it, let the cooperative do it. If the cooperative members do it, the cooperative's setup will be difficult to manage. Thus, it was decided that all sideline occupations would be carried out by the cooperative. The cooperative would provide capital for brick making and fish farming, while cooperative members would invest in pig and chicken raising. Furthermore, the cooperative would occupy civilian houses as pig farms and chicken farms.

    At that time, the cooperative calculated that both agricultural and sideline occupations required labor, and each main laborer would not be able to complete the production plan even if they worked two hundred labor days a year. If they didn't find a way to get cooperative members to work more, there would be no way to complete the production plan. Therefore, they issued regulations prohibiting cooperative members from going out to work casually. Generally, cooperative members had to ask for leave to go out, and those who delayed the cooperative's work by engaging in their own sideline occupations would have work points deducted. Tang Yisheng wanted to engage in transportation, but the cooperative did not agree. Some people who used to be carpenters, tailors, or fishermen stopped their work. Everyone concentrated on fighting drought and accumulating fertilizer in the cooperative. In this way, work was being done, but problems also arose. Pig raising lost money; the clay pots that were fired were not wanted; and of the one hundred and seventy-five chickens collected from the cooperative members, because of disease and attacks by wild cats, thirty-eight died in one morning. Now, there are only seventeen left.

    Cooperative members did not have their own sideline occupations, and they ran out of money for oil and salt. Some reflected, "The cooperative has controlled us to death, strangled us to death." Some said, "After joining the cooperative, my oil and salt jars were also smashed. What kind of superiority is this?" The cooperative members had no choice but to hold out their hands and borrow from the cooperative. The cooperative members had opinions, and the cooperative cadres were also very anxious, but they just didn't have a solution. Fortunately, in July, the prefectural committee sent a work team to organize the development of cooperative members' household sideline occupations. This time, the cooperative cadres' minds changed. They distinguished which could be uniformly carried out by the cooperative and which could be allowed to be carried out by the cooperative members themselves, and no longer controlled them so rigidly. As long as it did not affect the cooperative's collective operation, they let the cooperative members engage in them on their own. Those who knew how to drive boats drove boats, those who knew how to weave cloth wove cloth, and carpenters and doctors all put their specialties to use. Those who did not have special skills went into transportation. In the cooperative members' homes, they could also raise more chickens and ducks. The cooperative helped cooperative members solve the difficulties of engaging in sideline occupations and signed contracts with supply and marketing cooperatives. Now, there are seventy people in the entire cooperative who earn money by going out to work, and their monthly income can reach about 4,000 yuan. After the pigs raised by the cooperative and the piglets born were distributed to cooperative members for private raising through borrowing, all of the more than fifty households that had not raised pigs before now raise them well. Few people come to the cooperative to borrow money casually, and no one shouts to withdraw from the cooperative anymore.

    在南村农业社看多种经营
    黄驭白
    10月间，我一到湖南湘潭县的南村农业社，就看到圆圆的山丘上，小树成林，没有一点荒土；沿河一大片晚稻田正当黄熟，显示出一派丰收景象。靠南面，社里烧的一座瓦窑，刚才封火，两座罐壶窑正在上炉。罐壶窑的斜对面，越过山圹，就是社里养猪的地方。这里一共喂了大小三十二头猪，里面十六只小猪是三只母猪才生下的，还有八只母猪也快要生了。社干部老谭一边给我们谈着将来的生产规划，一边引导我们参观社里的副业生产。后来我们又到了社员个人养鸡最多的郭少成家里。
    郭少成靠四只老母鸡孵出了大大小小四十五只鸡。现在每天都有四、五只鸡生蛋，郭少成迎着我们笑着说：“这一来，我的油盐钱早就够了。”他说完又补充一句：“就连鸡粪明年也可以出它两担，换得两担谷子。”我问老谭一般社员的家庭副业生产怎么样，老谭想了想，蛮肯定地说：“每家平均约有十只鸡，一头猪，蔬菜完全够吃，还有别的活路进钱。就连上七十岁的五保户朱谭氏自己也喂了三只鸡，种了一分多田的菜，他的菜自己吃不完，还要送人。”
    这个社的副业生产怎样搞得这样好呢？为了想弄清这些，我们又访问了社主任。南村社是今年元月由初级社升成高级社的。春耕生产的时候，省里县里都号召搞千斤丰产，南村社当时也订了一个百分之百的扩种双季稻计划，社员们那时节劲头也很高，总想如何能把一亩田当成两亩田用才好，全社的力量都集中用在农业生产上。4月间，县委开了会，批评生产单一化，提倡多搞副业。社里开头研究搞副业生产时，有的社干部说：既然是高级社了，副业生产也应该由社来统一搞，才像个搞社会主义的样子。如果让社员自己去搞副业，他在社里就会少出工，有点肥料就会往自己田里放，那岂不要影响社里的生产。社主任当时也是这样想：要搞就由社来搞，如果由社员去搞，社里的摊子就会箍不拢了。这样便决定副业都由社来搞。烧窑、养鱼由社里垫本，养猪、养鸡由社员投资。还要占用民房作猪场鸡场。
    当时社里算了一笔账，农副业共需用工，每个主要劳力一年作两百个劳动日也不够；如果不想办法叫社员多出工，就没法完成生产计划。他们便订出了不准社员随便出外作工的规定，一般社员外出也要请假，哪个搞自己的副业误了社里的工还要扣工分。汤义生想搞点运输，社里没答应，一些过去做木匠、裁缝、打鱼弄虾的都停下来了。大家都集中在社里抗旱积肥，这一来，出工是出工了，可是问题也来了。养猪贴了本；烧出来的炊壶没人要；从社员那里集中起来的一百七十五只鸡，因为发瘟加上野猫咬，一个早上就死了三十八只，现在只剩下十七只了。
    社员们没有自己的副业，油盐钱也没有了，有的就反映：“把社员统死了，卡死了。”有的说：“进得社来，把我的油盐罐子也打烂了。这算什么优越性？”社员们没办法，就只有伸起手向社里借。社员有意见，社干部也很焦急，可就是没有办法。幸亏7月间地委去了个工作组，组织发展社员的家庭副业。这一下，社干部的脑筋才转了过来，分清了哪些是可以由社里统一搞的，哪些是可以让社员自己去搞的，不再卡得那样死了。只要不影响社里的集体经营，就放手让社员自己去搞。会驾船的驾船，会织布的织布，木匠、医生都发挥了自己的专长。没专门手艺的，就去搞运输。社员家里，还可以多养鸡鸭。社里一方面帮助社员解决搞副业的困难，一方面同供销社订了合同。到现在，全社光出门做工进钱的就有七十个人，每个月收入可以达到四千元左右。把社里养的猪和生下来的小猪用借支办法分给社员私养后，以前五十多户没养猪的，现在都养好了。很少还有人再到社里来随便借钱，更没有人再喊退社了。
