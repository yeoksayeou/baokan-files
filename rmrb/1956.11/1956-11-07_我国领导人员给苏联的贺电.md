    Greetings from Chinese Leaders to the Soviet Union
    To Comrade K. Y. Voroshilov, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics:
    To Comrade N. A. Bulganin, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics:
    To Comrade D. T. Shepilov, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics:

    On the occasion of the 39th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution, we, on behalf of the Chinese government and the Chinese people, extend our heartfelt and warm congratulations to you, and through you, to the fraternal Soviet government and the Soviet people.

    Over the past year, under the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government, the Soviet people have achieved remarkable successes in the cause of communist construction and in the struggle for the relaxation of international tensions. These achievements have inspired the countries that are building socialism and the people of all countries who are fighting for a better future.

    The unity and cooperation between the Soviet Union and the socialist countries have also undergone new developments. We are pleased to see that the Soviet government recently issued a declaration on the foundation of developing and further strengthening the friendship and cooperation between the Soviet Union and other socialist countries. This declaration fully demonstrates the Soviet Union's loyalty to the common interests of the great unity of socialist countries and the principles of proletarian internationalism. There is no doubt that this step taken by the Soviet government will further strengthen the unity and friendly relations between socialist countries, thereby promoting the common economic upsurge of socialist countries.

    The great friendship and cooperation between China and the Soviet Union has been comprehensively developed. The Chinese people know from their own experience that the eternal friendship between China and the Soviet Union is in the fundamental interests of our two peoples and all progressive mankind. Further consolidating and developing this friendship will greatly enhance the strength of peace, democracy, and socialism, and make significant contributions to safeguarding world peace and the cause of human progress.

    May the eternal fraternal friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples be increasingly consolidated and developed.

    Long live the Great October Socialist Revolution!

    Mao Zedong, Chairman of the People's Republic of China
    Liu Shaoqi, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China
    Zhou Enlai, Premier of the State Council and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China
                                      November 6, 1956, in Beijing

    我国领导人员给苏联的贺电
    苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟最高苏维埃主席团主席克·叶·伏罗希洛夫同志：苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟部长会议主席尼·亚·布尔加宁同志：苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟外交部长德·特·谢皮洛夫同志：
    在伟大的十月社会主义革命三十九周年的时候，我们代表中国政府和中国人民向你们，并且通过你们向兄弟的苏联政府和苏联人民致衷心的、热烈的祝贺。
    一年来，苏联人民在苏联共产党和苏联政府的领导下，在共产主义建设事业中以及在争取和缓国际紧张局势的斗争中，都获得了显著的成就。这些成就鼓舞了正在建设社会主义的国家和为争取美好未来而斗争的各国人民。
    苏联和社会主义各国的团结和合作也有了新的发展。我们高兴地看到，最近苏联政府发表了关于发展和进一步加强苏联同其他社会主义国家的友谊和合作的基础的宣言。这个宣言充分地表现了苏联忠于社会主义各国伟大团结的共同利益和无产阶级国际主义的原则。毫无疑问，苏联政府所采取的这个步骤将会进一步加强社会主义国家间的团结和友好关系，从而促进社会主义各国的共同的经济高涨。
    中苏两国的伟大友谊和合作已经得到了全面的发展。中国人民根据自己的亲身体验深知中苏两国的永恒友谊是符合于我们两国人民和全体进步人类的根本利益的。进一步巩固和发展这个友谊将会极大地增强和平、民主、社会主义的力量，并且为维护世界和平和人类进步事业作出重大贡献。
    祝中苏两国人民之间的永恒的兄弟友谊日益巩固和发展。
    伟大的十月社会主义革命万岁！
