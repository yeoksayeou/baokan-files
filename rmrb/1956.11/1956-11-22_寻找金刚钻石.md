Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 21st: The 413 Exploration and Survey Team of the Hunan Provincial Geological Bureau Preparatory Office, searching for diamonds in the middle reaches of the Yuan River, has discovered a large quantity of diamonds in the gravel of the river beaches in this area this year; it is estimated that the quantity is over 100,000 carats (each carat equals 200 milligrams). Some of the diamonds that have been panned out shine with a white luster, while others have a pink hue; the largest of these is about the size of an adult's thumb and is extremely valuable. This diamond has now been sent to the Ministry of Geology for preservation.

The staff of the 413 Exploration and Survey Team, who are conducting exploration in this area, are working very hard. They dig gravel in the silted beaches and rapid currents of river bends, panning and washing it, and finally take the resulting gray sand back to the room to be irradiated with "X-rays." Under "X-rays," the diamonds, which look almost the same as sand to the naked eye, will shine with strange, colorful lights.

According to exploration, diamonds washed by the water have been found almost everywhere in the river beaches from Dingjiagang to Anjiang in the middle reaches of the Yuan River. At present, the 413 Exploration and Survey Team is stepping up its panning and surveying work in order to trace the primary source of these diamonds based on the panning situation.

    寻找金刚钻石
    新华社长沙21日电　在沅江中游寻找金刚石的湖南省地质局筹备处四一三勘探普查队，今年在这个地区的河滩砂砾中发现了大量的金刚石；据计算，数量在十万克拉
  （每克拉等于二百毫克）以上。已经淘选出来的金刚石有的闪着白色的光辉，有的呈现着粉红色；其中最大的一颗有成人的大姆指头大，十分珍贵。这颗金刚石现在已经送到地质部珍藏。
    在这个地区进行勘探的四一三勘探普查队的职工们，工作十分艰苦。他们在河流弯曲处的淤滩、河床急流等地方，挖取砂砾，进行淘洗，最后把得来的灰砂拿回室内，用“爱克斯”光照射。在“爱克斯”光下，那些肉眼看来和砂子差不多的金刚石，就会闪出五颜十色的奇异的光彩。
    根据勘探，在沅江中游的丁家港至安江的河滩中，几乎到处都发现了被水冲来的金刚石。目前，四一三勘探普查队正在加紧进行淘选和普查工作，以便根据淘选的情况，跟踪追索这些金刚石的原生矿源。
