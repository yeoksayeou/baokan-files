Xinhua News Agency, November 28th: Xinhua News Agency reporter Li Zhaoyi reports: The first engineering section of the Neikun Railway has sections of substandard subgrade engineering, hindering the smooth progress of track laying. From the 6th to the 23rd of this month, the track laying project has only advanced six kilometers. According to the plan of the No. 1 detachment of the track laying and bridge building team of the Second Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways to lay 2.5 to 3 kilometers of track per day, they should have been erecting steel beams on the Gaotan Bridge, 24 kilometers away, by the 20th. The technical leader of this detachment said that based on the current track laying progress and subgrade conditions, the original plan to lay track to Zigong by the end of this month will be difficult to achieve.

The reporter departed from the track laying point in Neijiang and walked more than ten kilometers along the railway line, observing the completed state of this section of the subgrade engineering. In several places, the subgrade of the track-laid section has already experienced severe subsidence. Three culvert pipes in the track-laid section have experienced obvious tilting, collapse, and cracking engineering quality accidents. In the sections where track is about to be laid, the subgrade has not been completely cleaned, and there are still dangerous rocks and loose soil nearby, affecting the work of the track laying workers. According to engineer Nie Bingjun and others from the No. 1 Engineering Section of the No. 1 Engineering Department of the Second Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways, who are responsible for constructing this section of the subgrade, the Neikun Railway began construction in February this year. At that time, the project progressed very slowly due to the lack of supply of construction machinery and tools. It wasn't until September this year, just over a month before track laying was scheduled to begin, that the Engineering Bureau promised to guarantee the supply of the machinery and tools they needed. However, due to the urgent construction period, a situation of being loose at the beginning and tight at the end had already been created. It was very difficult to excavate and fill hundreds of thousands of cubic meters of earth and stone in a short period of just over a month and build the subgrade well.

According to Nie Bingjun and others, the workers were unwilling to rush work recklessly. The work area had requested the leadership to extend the construction period, but this was not approved. Therefore, they had no choice but to rush the progress day and night. The work area's plan at the time was to build the subgrade into shape so that the tracks could be laid, and the poorer parts of the project could be improved later. Therefore, since September, some places have not been constructed in accordance with technical operating procedures, resulting in poor quality phenomena such as loose and subsided subgrade, insufficient width on both sides of the subgrade, and poor slope trimming.

### 赶工蛮干不按技术操作规程施工  内昆铁路部分路基质量低劣

    赶工蛮干不按技术操作规程施工
    内昆铁路部分路基质量低劣
    新华社28日讯　新华社记者李昭伊报道：内昆铁路第一工程段部分路基工程质量低劣，使铺轨不能顺利进行。从本月6日开始到23日，铺轨工程只向前伸展了六公里多。按照铁道部第二工程局钉道架桥队一分队每天铺轨两公里半到三公里的计划，二十号这天，他们就应该在二十四公里外的高滩大桥上架设钢梁了。这个分队的技术领导人说，根据现在的铺轨进度和路基情况看来，原定本月月底铺轨到自贡的计划，已经很难实现。
    记者曾从内江铺轨点出发，沿着铁路线行走十多公里，观看了这段路基工程建成后的情形。现在铺了钢轨的线路，有几处路基已经发生了严重的下陷现象。铺了钢轨地段的涵洞管道，就有三处发生了明显的歪垮和沉裂的工程质量事故。在将要铺设钢轨的地段上，路基也还没有完全清理干净，附近还有危石散土，影响铺轨职工进行工作。据负责修筑这段路基的铁道部第二工程局第一工程段一工区的工程师聂秉均等人说，内昆铁路在今年2月开工，当时由于施工机械和施工工具得不到供应，工程进展很漫。直到今年9月份离开铺轨只有一个多月时，工程局才答应保证供应对他们所需要的机械和工具。但是，由于工期紧迫，前松后紧的局面已经造成。在短短的一个多月里，要挖填几十万土石方，并且把路基修好是很困难的。
    据聂秉均等人说，当时职工们并不愿意赶工蛮干，工区曾经向领导方面要求延长工期，但是没有得到同意，于是不得不日夜抢赶进度。工区当时的打算是把路基修筑成形，让钢轨能够铺过去，至于工程较差的部分可以等以后再来改善。因此，从9月份以后，一些地方没有按照技术操作规程施工，以致造成现在的路基松散下陷，路基两旁宽度不够，以及边坡刷修不良等质量不好的现象。
