Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, November 13th. Indonesian President Sukarno delivered a speech to university and middle school students in Bandung on November 9th, recounting his observations and thoughts from his visits abroad.

Sukarno spent a considerable amount of time discussing his observations and feelings about his visit to China. He said that what impressed him most was the rapid progress of China's construction in just a few years. He stated that China is not only engaged in large-scale construction, but also in small-scale construction, such as those in rural areas.

Sukarno pointed out that China's construction emphasizes basic industrial construction. He cited Anshan Iron and Steel Company as an example, and excitedly described the construction of Anshan Iron and Steel.

Sukarno said that, like the Soviet Union, China also has many female engineers, whose talents are no less than those of male engineers. He said that the Yangtze River Bridge is remarkable, and female engineers participated in the planning and construction of this bridge. Their status is the same as that of male engineers. Sukarno then said that when he was studying engineering at a young age, he saw the Serayu Bridge built by the Dutch in Central Java and admired it immensely. But after seeing the Yangtze River Bridge, he felt that the Serayu Bridge could not be compared with it at all.

President Sukarno mentioned that Chairman Mao Zedong told him that in the early days of the victory of the revolution, China was very short of talent and materials, so it asked the Soviet Union for help in construction, because China believed that as a socialist country, the Soviet Union was willing to help other countries in construction based on its political and economic system, and in fact, the Soviet Union did meet China's requirements. In this way, the Soviet Union sent batches of machines and experts to help China with construction. The President said: "I got the impression that the Soviet Union seemed to be moving factories from the Soviet Union to China."

Sukarno was deeply impressed by the fact that China is already able to produce some machines and weapons on its own. He pointed out: "China's seven years of construction has been able to meet all basic needs."

Sukarno said that the Chinese working class, peasants, intellectuals, soldiers, and progressive national bourgeoisie are "united in construction." He advised everyone not to think that every Chinese person is a Communist Party member, and that Sun Yat-sen's wife is not. He said that he had talked to an industrialist who was a member of the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang, and this industrialist, in response to Sukarno's inquiry, said that although he was not a Communist Party member, he agreed with the construction plan led by the Communist Party.

Talking about his visit to the United States, Sukarno said that he went to the United States to see if the spirit of Jefferson still existed. He said that there is still "freedom of speech" in the United States, but there is no "freedom from want." The United States has become a tool of the bourgeoisie. In the United States, there is a wide gap between rich and poor, and a large part of the common people live in poverty. The President said: "This is a democratic country with unequal distribution of wealth."

Sukarno believes that the Soviet Union first valued "freedom from want," and then "freedom of speech." He said that the Soviet people are working hard to get rid of poverty, and they have successfully carried out large-scale construction. He said: "Whether we agree with the communist system or not, we are amazed that they have established a united society."

Sukarno said that Indonesia's five-year construction plan does not yet include all basic needs. Indonesia's construction plan should also include a plan to make society healthy, that is, it should also include a plan to transform thinking.

He criticized the influence of the so-called "Dutch way of thinking," and then said, "Old ideas must be eliminated, and thinking must be transformed, as in China."

He emphasized: "The absolute condition for Indonesia's construction is to first establish the steel industry. Indonesia has iron sand, and Indonesia has coal. Mining these two resources is an urgent task for Indonesia's industrial construction."

Sukarno believes that there is no need to be afraid of foreign experts being sent to Indonesia to assist in construction, nor is there any need to be afraid of accepting foreign proposals to provide industrial capital assistance in a non-capitalist manner.

Regarding democracy, Sukarno said: If our politicians want to talk about democracy, don't just look at the West. There are many kinds of democracy, not just in Western Europe. Democracy is a means, not an end. Our goal is to build a just and prosperous society, and it can only be achieved by relying on the power of unity and democratic means.

Sukarno suggested that Indonesia should have social democracy. In this democracy, the parliament has the right to decide the country's political and economic policies, as in China and the Soviet Union.

He said, "But I am not suggesting that everyone imitate the democracy of the United States, the Soviet Union, or China. Instead, everyone should discover their own democracy from their own land and restore their former appearance. Independence means taking responsibility, and this responsibility is to restore one's own appearance. The democratic system and the national system are reflections of each nation's own appearance."

    苏加诺谈访问中国、苏联和美国的感想
    新华社雅加达13日电　印度尼西亚总统苏加诺11月9日在万隆对大学生和中学生发表演说，叙述他在国外访问的观感。
    苏加诺用较长的时间谈到他访问中国的见闻和感想。他说，首先使他赞叹不已的是中国建设在短短几年内如此突飞猛进。他说，中国不仅进行大规模的建设，而且进行小规模的建设，如农村里的那些建设。
    苏加诺指出，中国的建设着重基本工业建设。他举出鞍山钢铁公司作例子，并且兴奋地叙述了鞍钢的兴建情况。
    苏加诺说，和苏联一样，中国也有许多女工程师，她们的才干并不逊于男工程师。他说，长江大桥真了不起，这座桥的计划和施工都有女工程师参加。她们的地位和男工程师的地位一样。苏加诺接着说，他年青学工程时，看到荷兰人在中爪哇建筑的塞拉约大桥，佩服得五体投地。但是自从看了长江大桥之后，他认为塞拉约大桥是丝毫不能同它相比。
    苏加诺总统谈到毛泽东主席对他说，中国在革命胜利初期，非常缺乏人才和物资，便向苏联请求帮助建设，因为中国相信，作为社会主义国家的苏联，基于它的政治和经济制度，是愿意帮助别国建设的，而事实上苏联的确答应了中国的要求。就是这样，苏联把成批的机器和专家等送过来帮助中国建设。总统说：“我得到这样的印象：苏联似乎是把一座座的工厂从苏联搬到中国来”。
    苏加诺对于中国已经能够自己生产某些机器和武器，获得深刻的印象。他指出：“中国的七年建设，已经能够满足一切基本需要。”
    苏加诺说，中国工人阶级、农民、知识分子、军人和进步的民族资产阶级“在建设方面是团结一致的”。他劝告大家不要认为每个中国人都是共产党员，孙中山先生的夫人就不是。他说，他曾经和一位实业家谈话，这位实业家是国民党革命委员会的党员，这个实业家在回答苏加诺的询问时说，他虽然不是共产党员，但是他同意共产党所领导的建设计划。
    谈到在美国的访问，苏加诺说，他到美国是为了要看杰弗逊的精神是否还存在。他说，在美国还有“言论自由”，但是没有“免于匮乏的自由”。美国成为资产阶级工具的国家。在美国，贫富悬殊，有一大部分平民生活很穷困。总统说：“这是一个财富不平均的民主国家”。
    苏加诺认为，苏联首先重视“免于匮乏的自由”，而后才是“言论自由”。他说，苏联人拚命地工作，以便摆脱贫困，他们已经成功地进行了巨大规模的建设。他说：“不管同意不同意共产主义制度，我们惊叹他们已经建立了一个团结一致的社会。”
    苏加诺说，印度尼西亚的五年建设计划还没有包括一切基本需要。印度尼西亚的建设计划也应当包括使社会健全化的计划，就是说也应该包括改造思想的计划。
    他批评所谓“荷兰思想方法”的影响，接着说，“旧的思想必须清除掉，必须进行思想改造，如同在中国的情形一样。”
    他强调说：“印度尼西亚建设的绝对条件，是先建立钢铁工业。印度尼西亚有铁砂，印度尼西亚有煤，开采这两种资源是印度尼西亚工业化建设的迫不及待的任务。”
    苏加诺认为，不必害怕外国派遣专家来印度尼西亚协助建设的建议，也不必害怕接受外国以非资本主义方式提出的关于提供工业资本援助的建议。
    关于民主，苏加诺说：如果我们的政治家要谈论民主，不要只看西方。民主有许多种，不只是在西欧才有。民主是手段，而不是目的。我们的目的是建设一个公正而繁荣的社会，只有依靠团结的力量和民主的手段，才能实现它。
    苏加诺建议印度尼西亚应该有社会民主。在这种民主中，国会有权利决定国家的政治和经济政策，如同在中国和苏联一样。
    他说，“但是，我不是建议大家模仿美国、苏联或者中国的民主。而是大家要从自己的土地中发掘自己的民主，恢复从前的面目。独立意味着负起责任，这个责任就是恢复自己的面目。民主制度和国家制度是各民族自己的面目的反映”。
