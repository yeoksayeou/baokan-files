    Reminiscences of an Old Bolshevik in the Soviet Union
    Lin Danqiu
    Kakhovka is a famous hydroelectric power station construction site in the Soviet Union, and also a beautiful new city. The pleasing sight of cream-colored buildings gleaming amidst the lush greenery is almost like a part of Kiev, the "garden city." On the day we arrived, as soon as our luggage was unloaded, two Chinese youths came to see us with a Soviet elder. The two youths were Chinese interns at the engineering office here. Then who was this Soviet elder? Comrade Zeng Shencong, an intern, replied, "He is our teacher." His companion, Comrade Yu Guangfeng, added, "Mechanical Engineer, Deputy Secretary of the Party Committee of the Construction Site Mechanization Engineering Department, Comrade Chernov."
    The three teachers and students could have sat comfortably on the sofa, but they insisted on squeezing together tightly. The affectionate scene of the teachers and students whispering to each other truly gave people a feeling of being connected by blood and sharing the same breath. This is easy to understand. Don't the old heroes who have endured the hardships of life's battlefield and the new warriors who are inexperienced in the world have something in common? In the spiritual realm, I understand the closeness of a kind grandfather and a radiant grandson. Moreover, under the encouragement of the socialist and communist cause, what is there that cannot be understood about the exchange, fusion, and burning of thoughts and feelings between the Soviet elder and the Chinese youth?
    "The teacher is an old Bolshevik who participated in the October Revolution, an old engineer from a working-class background, and is sixty years old this year. In his work, he is a very strict teacher, not allowing you to be even slightly careless; but in life, he is sometimes just like a child..." Before the intern finished speaking, the elder turned his smiling face and whispered something to him. The other party answered him in Russian, and the elder laughed as innocently as a child.
    This meeting was very brief. The elder had to say goodbye to us in a hurry to attend the Communist Youth League meeting of the engineering office.
    The day before we left Kakhovka, accompanied by Comrades Zeng and Yu, I visited the elder's home. He was wearing a brand new white Ukrainian tunic that day, with beautiful black lace trimming the collar, front, and wide sleeves. He looked even younger.
    The room was an ordinary room in a collective dormitory, with walls covered with framed photos and colorful paintings. Before I had time to take a closer look, the elder pointed to one of them and said, "See that? That's your Tiananmen Square in Beijing!"
    We sat around a table, drinking tea and talking. The elder's short and wiry old partner sat opposite him, often supplementing her husband's conversation. A little angel-like girl of twelve or thirteen particularly caught my attention: sometimes the two elders could not fully understand my meaning through translation, but this little girl understood and explained it to the elders. She was their granddaughter.
    The elder had no sons, only three daughters, all of whom were already married. This granddaughter was raised by her maternal grandparents and is now a seventh-grade student in a ten-year school, and also takes three lessons a week at a music school. The elder bought her a very good and expensive accordion.
    "Why not cultivate her talents?" the grandmother said. "She has musical talent, and we have the strength to cultivate her." The grandfather added, "Bring the accordion and play a few tunes, child, so that the Chinese comrades can listen to your music."
    The brand new accordion gleamed brightly, and the skillful movements of the little fingers were amazing. We first heard Tchaikovsky's "The Lark," and then "Cavalry March." The two elders initially squinted their eyes, gently tapping their fingers on the table; but as soon as they heard "Cavalry March," the old engineer couldn't help but open his throat and sing along. The singing was like a raging flame, the burning of a youthful passion for battle.
    The music stopped. We started talking again, and the topic quickly turned to the elder's revolutionary experience.
    "I am the son of a working-class family. My father was a lathe operator, and I was also a lathe operator. After studying for four years, I went to work in a factory. Because I participated in a strike, I was soon arrested..." The storm of the October Revolution swept him out of the Tsar's prison, and he soon became a glorious Communist Party member.
    "The construction work after the October Revolution was so difficult, comrade." The elder's right hand gently stroked my left hand on the table, his eyes fixed on mine: "At that time, the working class did not have its own experts, and it was difficult to prevent the enemy from sabotage."
    What to do? The Party selected a thousand worker Party members to enter accelerated schools to learn culture, and then enter specialized schools to learn professional knowledge. He, Chernov, was one of the first of these people. "When I graduated from the Odessa Specialized School in 1933, I was already the father of three children."
    "I can't forget the factory that made glass utensils in Kherson City, where I was the director. What a beautiful factory!" He paused, squinting his eyes and smiling, as if he saw the sparkling of the factory's glass utensils. "Not far from here, I would like to accompany you to see it. What a beautiful factory!"
    I understood his feelings, just as I understand the feelings of a serious writer for his own work.
    When the conversation touched on the Great Patriotic War, the elder became even more excited. He jumped away and jumped back again, taking out an old black uniform to show me. I saw a striking Red Banner Medal, which was an award for his meritorious service in the defense of Leningrad.
    "We need to fight, and we also need to work. Socialist construction requires first-rate technology and outstanding experts." The old engineer's eyes swept alternately over the two Chinese interns. "They are all good children, and I guarantee that they will be good experts after they return home..."
    Listening to the old engineer's praise for the Chinese interns' hard work and hard study, I remembered the touching scene that the two interns had described to me the day before: the Soviet teacher held the Chinese intern's hand tightly, driving a huge bulldozer on the uneven construction site, even though the temperature was thirty degrees below zero, both the teacher and student were sweating profusely...
    So we talked about the construction and living conditions in China, and the old couple asked questions one after another. They pricked up their ears to listen to my answers, nodding constantly. Finally, the old engineer stood up, held one of my hands in both of his, and his voice trembled with excitement:
    "Thank you, comrade. As a worker cultivated by Lenin's party, I ask you to convey the old Bolshevik's respect to the Chinese working class!"
    I said goodbye. The two elders saw me downstairs. In the courtyard of the collective dormitory, the sounds of running and laughing of boys and girls were boiling. The old engineer suddenly grabbed my hand and said, "Look at these children!" He giggled like a child.

    记苏联的一个老布尔什维克
    林淡秋
    卡霍夫卡是苏联一个有名的水电站建设工地，也是一座漂亮的新建城市。那绿树浓荫中闪现着奶油色层楼的悦目景象，简直像是“花园城市”基辅的一部分。我们到达这里的那一天，行装刚刚卸下，便有两个中国青年同一个苏联老人一起来看我们。两个青年是这里工程处的中国实习生，那末这位苏联老人是谁呢？实习生曾慎聪同志回答道：“是我们的老师。”他的同伴俞光风同志补充道：“机械工程师，工地机械化工程处党委会副书记契尔诺夫同志。”
    师生三人很可以宽宽舒舒地坐在长沙发上，但他们偏要紧紧地挤在一起。师生交头接耳的亲热情景，真正给人以血肉相连、呼吸相通的感觉。这是容易理解的。在人生战场上，久历风霜的老英雄和阅世未深的新战士难道没有共同点吗？在精神领域里，我懂得慈祥的祖父和烂缦的孙儿的接近。何况同在社会主义、共产主义事业的鼓舞下，苏联老人与中国青年之间的思想感情的交流、融合、燃烧，有什么不能领会呢？
    “老师是参加过十月革命的老布尔什维克，工人出身的老工程师，今年六十岁了。在工作上，他是非常严的老师，不许你有一点马虎；可是在生活上，他有时简直像小孩子……”实习生还没有说完，老人便转过微笑的脸，低声向他说些什么。对方用俄语回答了他，老人真像孩子一样，天真地笑了。
    这次见面是非常短促的。老人为了出席工程处的共青团会议，不得不匆匆向我们告辞了。
    在我们离开卡霍夫卡的前一天，在曾、俞两同志的陪伴下，我访问了老人的家庭。他这一天穿着崭新的白色乌克兰短衫，领口、对襟、宽大的袖口，都镶着美丽的黑花边。他显得更年轻了。
    房间是集体宿舍的普通房间，左右两壁挂满了有镜框的照片和彩画。我还来不及细看，老人便指着其中的一幅说：“看见吗？这是你们北京的天安门！”
    我们围着一张台子坐下来，一边喝茶，一边谈话。老人的对面坐着他的矮小精干的老伴，她时常补充丈夫的谈话。一个小天使似的十二、三岁小姑娘特别引起我的注意：两位老人有时不能通过翻译充分了解我的语意，这个小姑娘倒听懂了，向老人作解释。她是他们的外孙女。
    老人没有儿子，只有三个女儿，都早已出嫁了。这个外孙女是外公外婆带大的，现在是十年制学校的七年级生，每星期还在音乐学校上三堂课。老人给她买了一个很好很贵的手风琴。
    “为什么不培养她呢？”外婆说。“她有音乐天才，我们有培养她的力量。”外公接着说：“拿手风琴来奏几曲吧，孩子，让中国同志听听你的音乐。”
    崭新的手风琴灿然放光，小手指的熟练动作叫人惊奇。我们先听到柴可夫斯基的“小鸟”，接着又听到“骑兵进行曲”。两位老人最初眯着眼睛，在台子上轻轻打着拍子；但一听到“骑兵进行曲”，老工程师情不自禁地放开喉咙唱起来了。歌声有如熊熊的火焰，这是战斗的青春热情的燃烧。
    音乐停止了。我们又开始谈话，话题很快转到老人的革命经历上去了。
    “我是工人阶级的儿子。父亲是车工，我也是车工，读了四年书，便进工厂了。因为参加罢工，不久便被抓去了。……”十月革命的风暴把他从沙皇的监狱里刮了出来，他不久便成了光荣的共产党员。
    “十月革命后的建设工作多么艰难呀，同志。”老人的右手轻轻抚摩着我放在台上的左手，他的眼睛凝视着我的眼睛：“当时工人阶级没有自己的专家，很难防止敌人的破坏。”
    怎么办呢？党选拔了一千名工人党员进速成学校学文化，再进专科学校学专业知识，他，契尔诺夫便是这第一批人中的一个。“1933年我在奥德萨专科学校毕业的时候，已经是三个孩子的父亲了。”
    “我不能忘记赫尔松城那个制造玻璃器皿的工厂，我在那里当过厂长。多漂亮的工厂呀！”他停住话头，眯着眼睛微笑着，好像看到了那个工厂的玻璃器皿的闪光。“离这里不远，我愿意陪你去看看。多漂亮的工厂！”
    我理解他的感情，正如理解一个严肃作家对自己作品的感情一样。
    谈话接触到卫国战争的时候，老人更激动了。一步跳开去，又一步跳回来，把一件黑色旧制服拿给我看，我看到了一个触目的红旗勋章，这是对他在列宁格勒保卫战中立功的奖赏。
    “我们需要战斗，也需要劳动。社会主义建设需要头等技术，需要出色的专家。”老工程师的目光轮流地扫着两个中国实习生。“他们都是好孩子，我保证他们回国后是好专家。……”
    听着老工程师对中国实习生苦学苦练的赞美，我想起了前一天两位实习生对我描述过的动人的情景：苏联老师紧紧把着中国实习生的手，在高低不平的工地上驾驶着巨大的推土机，尽管是零下三十度的天气，老师学生都是满头大汗……。
    我们于是谈起中国的建设情况和生活情况，老夫妇俩便你一句我一句地问个不停。他们尖起耳朵倾听我的回答，不断地点头。老工程师最后站起身来，双手捧住我的一只手，声音激动得有些发抖了：
    “谢谢你，同志。我以列宁党培养出来的工人身分，请求你替我向中国工人阶级致老布尔什维克的敬礼！”
    我告辞了。两个老人送下楼来。集体宿舍的大院子里，沸腾着男女孩子们的奔跑声和嬉笑声。老工程师突然拉住我的手说：“你看这些孩子呀！”他也像孩子一样地格格笑了。
