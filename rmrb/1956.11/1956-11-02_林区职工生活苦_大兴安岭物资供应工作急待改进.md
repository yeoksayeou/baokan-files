Xinhua News Agency, Hailar, November 1st. Xinhua News Agency reporter Mao Chunli reports: The supply of goods in the Greater Khingan Range forest industrial area lags behind the needs of production, construction and the development of people's lives, and urgently needs improvement.

Great changes have taken place in the primitive forests of the Greater Khingan Range in recent years. Since 1952, the state has rapidly opened up new timber harvesting bases in the hinterland of the Greater Khingan Range, built factories, and laid railways; forest management institutions to protect forest resources have also been established in large numbers. Every year, thousands of builders come to the forest and establish their homes. To date, four forest towns with tens of thousands of people and dozens of settlements with thousands of people have appeared here, and more than one hundred thousand people live here.

Because commercial work has not kept up, there are still many difficulties in the lives of the builders in the Greater Khingan Range. Vegetables produced in the agricultural areas near the forest area cannot be sold, but forest workers often cannot get vegetables. People living in Yitulihe in the forest industrial area eat an average of less than three taels of green vegetables per day. Workers living in the remote logging sites of the Kuduer Forest Industry Bureau and the Anli workshop only received one green onion per person in the first nine months of this year. Outside the forest area is the Hulunbuir Grassland, which is rich in cattle and sheep, but the supply of beef is also intermittent. The fabrics and daily necessities sold by the commercial departments here are few in variety, monotonous in color, and often out of stock. The forest area is now in winter, and people want to make cotton-padded clothes, but the limited number of garment-making handicraft production cooperatives are too busy. If you send the materials now, you will not receive the finished product until a month later. Service industries are insufficient everywhere, there are few public canteens, and the simple bathhouses, barbershops, hotels and cinemas are overcrowded.

The poor supply of goods here is largely related to the imperfection of commercial institutions. The entire forest area has only one comprehensive commercial institution - the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Forest Area Trade Company, with six branch companies and twelve distribution stores. Except for a few towns with tens of thousands of people, most settlements do not have commercial institutions. Where there are commercial institutions, they cannot cope with the work due to the small number of personnel.

Why has commercial work in the forest industrial area been so backward for so long? This is largely related to the lack of concern for the lives of workers by leaders at all levels in the past. Leaders at all levels are not unaware of this problem, but they have not urged the relevant departments to thoroughly improve it.

### 林区职工生活苦  大兴安岭物资供应工作急待改进

    林区职工生活苦
    大兴安岭物资供应工作急待改进
    新华社海拉尔1日电　新华社记者毛纯礼报道：大兴安岭森林工业区物资供应工作落后于生产建设和人民生活发展的需要，急待改进。
    大兴安岭原始森林中近几年来发生了很大的变化。从1952年以来，国家在大兴安岭腹地迅速地开辟了新的木材采伐基地，建设了工厂，铺设了铁路；保护森林资源的森林经营机构也大批地建立起来。每年有成千上万的建设者来到森林中建立了家园。到目前为止，已有四个上万人的森林城镇和几十个上千人的居民点在这儿出现，十万多人在这里生活。
    由于商业工作没有赶上，在大兴安岭的建设者们生活中还存在很多困难，林区附近的农业区所产的蔬菜卖不掉，而林区职工却经常吃不到菜蔬。在森林工业区伊图里河生活的人们平均每人每天吃不到三两青菜。住在偏僻的伐木场库都尔森林工业局和安里车间的工人们，今年九个月，每人只分得了一棵大葱。出了林区，就是盛产牛、羊的呼伦贝尔大草原，但牛肉的供应也时断时续。这里商业部门经营的布匹和日用品，品种少、花色单调，而且时常脱销。目前林区已是冬季，人们想做棉衣，但有限的几家被服业手工生产合作社都忙得不可开交，现在送去衣料，一个月以后才能拿到成衣。服务性的行业到处都感不足，公共食堂很少，简陋的澡堂、理发馆、旅店和影剧院都拥挤不堪。
    这里物资供应工作做不好，和商业机构的不健全有很大关系。整个林区只有一个一揽子商业机构——内蒙古自治区林区贸易公司，下设六个支公司、十二个分销店。除几个上万人的城镇外，大部分居民点都没有商业机构。有商业机构的地方，也由于人员少，不能胜任工作。
    森林工业区内的商业工作为什么长期这样落后呢？这和过去各级领导对职工生活关心不够有很大关系。这个问题各级领导不是不知道，但却一直没有督促有关部门彻底加以改进。
