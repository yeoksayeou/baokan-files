    Shameless

    Egypt is already at war with Britain and France. However, the British and French governments, which launched the armed invasion of Egypt, refuse to declare war. They intend to use this cowardly tactic to cover up their act of aggression.

    On November 1, in the British House of Commons, the opposition demanded to know whether Britain had declared war on Egypt. The parliament was filled with shouts of "Answer... Answer... Answer."

    Silence reigned from the government benches, and no one came forward to answer. Members of Parliament stomped their feet and shouted. Someone yelled, "Coward!"

    After the House adjourned in disorder for half an hour, Eden came out to answer the opposition's motion of impeachment. He said, "We have not declared war."

    Opposition members shouted, "Shame!"

    Eden turned around, feigning surprise, and asked, "Shame?"

    This question is interesting. The dignified British Prime Minister, who has also served as Foreign Secretary for several terms, seems unaware that attacking another country without declaring war is a shameful thing. In 1938, when Eden resigned as Foreign Secretary out of anger at Chamberlain's appeasement of Hitler's aggression, he probably still had some sense of shame. But now, he has reached the point of not knowing what shame is.

    However, it doesn't matter. The Egyptian people and peace-loving people all over the world are teaching Eden a lesson. The title of this lesson is: "What is Shame." (Jiang)

### 不识羞耻

    不识羞耻
    埃及已经同英、法进入战争状态。可是，向埃及发动了武装进攻的英法政府却拒绝宣战。它们打算用这种卑怯的手段来给自己的侵略行为遮羞。
    11月1日，在英国下院中，反对党要求知道英国是否已经向埃及宣战。议会里充满了一片“答复……答复……答复”的叫喊声。
    政府席上一片沉默，没有人出来答复。议员们跺脚、呼喊。有人大叫：“胆小鬼！”
    下院在秩序混乱中休会半小时以后，艾登出来回答反对党的弹劾动议。他说，“我们一直没有宣战。”
    反对党的议员高喊道：“羞耻！”
    艾登转过身来，作惊奇状，问道：“羞耻吗？”
    这句话问得有意思。堂堂英国首相，还亏他当过几任外交大臣，却似乎还不知道不宣而战、侵略别国是可耻的事情。1938年，当艾登因为张伯伦纵容希特勒侵略愤而辞去外交大臣职务的时候，他大概还颇有羞耻之心。而现在，他已经到了不识羞耻为何物的地步了。
    不过，不要紧，埃及人民和全世界爱好和平的人民正在给艾登上课。这一课的题目就叫做：“什么是羞耻”。　　　（江）
