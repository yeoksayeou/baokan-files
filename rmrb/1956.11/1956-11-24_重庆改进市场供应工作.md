Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, November 23rd: Chongqing's leading organs are improving the market's supply of goods.

The ten inspection teams organized jointly by relevant units in Chongqing are studying and resolving some new problems brought about by the adjustment of the commercial network and the opening of the free market.

The Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China recently organized more than forty cadres to inspect the sewing industry and resolved the problem of the supply of winter clothing for citizens.

The Chongqing State-owned Food Company corrected the bureaucratic phenomenon of "waiting for goods" in the past and sent more than 300 experienced purchasing personnel to the countryside to strengthen the purchase of fattened pigs, ensuring accurate weighing and pricing according to quality in the purchase. This food company has also recently increased pork supply points in more than 40 locations such as Xuetianwan and Shibanpo, where residents have difficulty buying meat. The purchase of chickens and ducks, which are in short supply in the market, has also been expanded, and the arrival of goods has begun to increase. The supply of goods that were originally in short supply has also gradually increased as the Municipal Department Store, Textile Company, and other relevant departments have taken measures.

    重庆改进市场供应工作
    新华社重庆23日电　重庆市领导机关改进对市场的物资供应工作。
    重庆市有关单位联合组织的十个检查组，正在研究和解决商业网的调整及自由市场开放后带来的一些新问题。
    中共重庆市委员会不久前组织了四十多个干部对缝纫业进行了检查，解决了市民冬季服装的供应问题。
    重庆市国营食品公司纠正了过去“坐等来货”的官僚主义现象，派出了三百多个有经验的采购人员下乡，加强肥猪的采购工作，采购中作到了称斤准确，按质论价。这个食品公司最近还在学田塆、石板坡等四十多处居民买肉较困难的地方，增加了猪肉供应点。对市场上较缺的鸡、鸭也扩大了采购，目前来货开始增多。原来供应较为紧张的商品，由于市百货公司、纺织品公司等有关部门已采取措施，供应量也逐渐增加。
