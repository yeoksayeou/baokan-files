Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 19th: The Chinese Communist Party's Poyang County Committee in Jiangxi Province recently held a plenary session to examine the subjectivism and bureaucratic work style of the county committee's leadership and to study methods for improvement.

The meeting examined the abnormal situation within the Poyang County Committee over the past year or so since the launch of the agricultural cooperation movement, where the main responsible cadres rarely went deep into a township or cooperative to conduct investigations and research. During the agricultural cooperation movement last winter and this spring, the county committee did not personally build a single good cooperative. After the establishment of the cooperatives, the county committee did not personally manage a single cooperative well. Some county committee members were simply trapped in their own departmental work, rarely concerning themselves with the central tasks. The county committee's leadership was often entangled in frequent meetings of various kinds. From January to August this year, the county committee held twenty-three meetings, each lasting at least two days and up to four or five days. Taking an average of three days per meeting, this amounted to sixty-nine days. Other meetings were also held excessively and for too long. These meetings were often poorly prepared. Some only focused on assigning tasks, using "issuing calls" and "making guarantees" as a substitute for in-depth discussions. As a result, the county committee's decisions and handling of certain issues became divorced from reality and the masses. For example, Tonglian Township, which had no late rice fields at all, was assigned the task of expanding late rice cultivation by more than 300 mu this year. As a result, more than 300 mu of middle rice fields were converted to late rice, leading to reduced yields. In the grain work, because the output was not investigated clearly and the disaster situation was not accurately investigated, the task allocation in some places was unreasonable. Some grassroots cadres, in order to complete the tasks, even resorted to searching warehouses and beating and scolding the masses, which caused great dissatisfaction among the masses. The county committee's bureaucratic style was also reflected in its lack of understanding and concern for the hardships of the masses, and its lack of humility in listening to the opinions of lower levels and the masses.

After inspection, the meeting believed that to overcome subjectivism and bureaucracy and improve leadership work, first of all, all county committee members should be organized to study in depth the resolutions and relevant documents of the Eighth National Congress of the Party, the Party Central Committee's decision on leadership methods, and Chairman Mao's article "Concern for the Well-being of the Masses, Attention to Working Methods" to raise ideological awareness. For the instructions of the Party Central Committee and the higher-level Party committees in each period, the county committee must study and delve into them in depth, and then implement them in combination with the specific conditions of the county. Secondly, the system of combining the collective leadership of the Party with individual division of labor and responsibility must be strengthened, and leadership methods must be improved. In particular, the method of holding meetings should be improved so that county committee members can have more time to go deep into reality. In the future, each county committee member should personally manage a key cooperative well, and conduct more typical investigations and help grassroots cadres summarize and exchange experiences based on different tasks in different periods, in order to improve the leadership level of grassroots cadres. Third, strengthen the Party's ideological and organizational work. The county committee must study the Party's organizational work and ideological education work once a month. At the same time, the county committee must earnestly help the rural Party grassroots organizations improve organizational life. When county committee members and district committee members go to the countryside, they should, without exception, participate in the meetings of the grassroots Party organizations, listen to the opinions and requirements of rural Party members and the masses.

Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, 20th, Xinhua News Agency reporter Zhang Hua reports: In the leadership work of various departments at the county level in Jianping County, Hebei Province, the shortcomings of having too many meetings and too many documents still exist. This phenomenon has attracted the attention of the Jianping County Committee of the Communist Party of China, and the county committee requires resolute elimination of this harmful bureaucratic style and habit.

According to statistics, the county's various departments have convened and plan to convene a total of thirty-nine county-wide meetings and training courses (excluding the Party school) in the fourth quarter, with a planned total of more than 10,000 people (township and cooperative cadres and activists). Each meeting lasts an average of five days, with some lasting seven days. The total meeting time is more than two hundred days. Because there are so many meetings, they are crowded together and cannot be separated, so two meetings must be held simultaneously in six days. The content of the meetings is also quite extensive, including more than twenty types of meetings such as public security and defense, mediation, procuratorate, supervision, water conservancy, afforestation, winter study, propaganda, preferential treatment, marriage, production, rectification, collection, breeding, elections, singing and dancing, clubs, medical services, youth, and women. The scale of the meetings is also quite large. The average number of participants in various meetings is 250, with some reaching 800. The loss of working time due to the meetings is quite serious. Based on the planned number of people and the duration of the meetings, the cumulative labor use during the meetings alone is 50,000 days. Adding the travel time to and from the meetings, the labor use for the meetings may reach about 70,000 days.

The county also has many documents and instructions. According to incomplete statistics, from July to October this year alone, the county committee meetings and the county committee's organization, propaganda, and rural supervision departments issued forty work instructions, plans, and notices to the township Party organizations, averaging one every three days. The documents are not only numerous but also long. The documents issued at the recent production relief and Party affairs work meeting in this county were as long as 15,000 words. According to the county committee's inspection, general documents are also five or six thousand words long. Because there are so many documents, cadres going to the countryside cannot read them all, and the role of written instructions has been greatly reduced. On the first day, the first team of Hongzi dian township village sent the wrong file to village of Zhai Zi. The next day, when the team went to investigate this mistake, the cadre in this village had used the file to paste his window.

The main reason for having so many meetings is the lack of unified and appropriate arrangements. For example, the three tasks of production, elections, and grain purchase to be done in November were originally planned to be convened in three meetings. Later, after the county committee merged the meetings into one, the three tasks were all deployed together. However, some meetings can still be merged and reduced. For example, the military service department planned to convene four meetings for one task, mobilizing 2,000 people to participate. The main reason for having many documents is that after the county committee issues instructions for a certain task, the relevant departments still issue instructions to their own systems. According to the county committee, the large number of meetings and official documents is also related to the higher-level leading organs.

### 中共江西鄱阳县委和河北建屏县委  检查官僚主义　改进工作作风

    中共江西鄱阳县委和河北建屏县委
    检查官僚主义　改进工作作风
    新华社南昌19日电　中国共产党江西省鄱阳县委员会最近召开全体会议，检查县委领导工作中的主观主义和官僚主义作风，研究了改进的办法。
    会议检查了农业合作化运动开展以来的一年多时间内，鄱阳县委几个主要负责干部很少深入一乡、一社进行调查研究的不正常情况。在去冬今春农业合作化运动中，县委没有亲自动手建好一个社；建社结束以后，县委又没有亲自动手办过一个社。有些县委委员只是陷在部门业务工作的圈子里，对中心工作很少过问。县委领导力量往往纠缠在频繁的各种会议中。从今年1月到8月，县委会曾经开了二十三次，每次少则两天，多则四、五天，每次会议平均以三天计算，便占去了六十九天。其它会议也有开得过多、过长的情况。这些会议，往往事先准备差，有的只是布置任务，以“发号召”、“下保证”的方式来代替深入的讨论，结果县委对于某些问题的决定和处理，就脱离实际、脱离群众。如潼联乡根本没有晚稻田，今年竟分配了扩种三百多亩晚稻的任务，结果造成三百多亩中稻田改种晚稻后减产。在粮食工作中，由于产量没有调查清楚，灾情没有调查确实，有些地方任务分配不合理，某些基层干部为了完成任务竟发生搜仓和打骂群众的现象，引起群众很大不满。县委的官僚主义作风还表现在不了解和不关心群众的生活疾苦，在听取下级和群众意见的时候不够虚心。
    经过检查，会议认为要克服主观主义和官僚主义，改进领导工作，首先要组织全体县委委员深入学习党的第八次全国代表大会的决议和有关文件、党中央关于领导方法的决定以及毛主席的“关心众群生活，注意工作方法”的文章，以提高思想认识。对于每个时期党中央和上级党委的指示，县委要深入学习钻研，然后结合本县具体情况加以贯彻执行。其次，要加强党的集体领导和个人分工负责相结合的制度，改进领导方法。特别要改进开会的方法，使县委委员能够有更多的时间深入实际。今后每个县委委员都要亲自办好一个基点合作社，并且根据不同时期的不同工作多做些典型调查，多帮助基层干部总结经验和交流经验，以提高基层干部的领导水平。第三，加强党的思想工作和组织工作。县委会每月必须研究一次党的组织工作和思想教育工作。同时，县委要切实帮助农村党的基层组织健全组织生活，县委委员和区委委员下乡的时候，应无例外地参加基层党组织的会议，听取农村党员以及群众的意见和要求。
    新华社保定20日电　新华社记者张华报道：河北省建屏县县级各部门的领导工作中，至今仍存在着会议多文件多的缺点。这种现象已引起中共建屏县委的注意，县委要求坚决消除这种官僚主义的有害作风和习气。
    据统计，这个县各部门第四季度已召开和计划召开的全县性会议和训练班（党校在外）达三十九次，计划召集的人数（乡、社干部和积极分子）共万余人。每次会议的时间平均五天，多的七天，会期总计在二百天以上。由于会议多，一个接一个会都挤不开，必须在六天当中同时举行两个会议。会议内容也相当繁多，有治安保卫、调解、检察、监察、水利、造林、冬学、宣传、优抚、婚姻、生产、整社、征收、饲养、选举、歌舞、俱乐部、医务、青年、妇女等二十多种。会议的规模也相当大。各种会议平均每次二百五十人，有的达到八百人。会议误工相当严重，以会议计划的人数、时间计算，只在会议期间即累计用工五万天，加上开会往返时间，开会用工可能达七万天左右。
    这个县的文件指示也很多。据不完全统计，仅今年7月份到10月份，县委会议及县委的组织、宣传、农村监察等部门，发往乡的党组织的工作指示、计划和通知等有四十件，平均每三天一件。文件不仅多，而且长。这个县最近召开的生产救灾和党务工作会议上发的文件，长达一万五千字。据县委检查，一般文件也都是五六千字。因为文件多，下乡干部阅读不过来，文字指示作用已大大降低。洪子店乡第一天给寨子村发错了文件，次日去追查时，这个村的干部竟将文件糊了窗户。
    会议多的主要原因是缺乏统一适当的安排。例如，11月要做的生产、选举、征购三项工作，原计划召开三个会议，后经县委合并召开一个会议，三项工作就一起布置了下去。但有些会议仍可以并减，如兵役部门为一项工作就准备召开四个会议，动员两千人参加。文件多主要是因为某项工作县委发过指示后，有关的部门还向自己的系统发指示。另据县委谈，会议多公文多同上级领导机关也有关系。
