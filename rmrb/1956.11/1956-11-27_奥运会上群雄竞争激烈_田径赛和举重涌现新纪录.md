Xinhua News Agency, Melbourne, November 26th: Except for the rowing competition, no other events took place at the Olympic Games yesterday (Sunday). After a day of quiet, the central stadium in Melbourne was once again packed today.

In the track and field arena, the javelin preliminaries were held in the morning. In the afternoon, the first event was the pole vault final. As a result, the defending champion, American athlete Richards, retained his title with a score of 4.56 meters, which is one centimeter higher than his own Olympic record.

Today's track events included the men's 800-meter and women's 100-meter finals. In the 800-meter final, American Courtney took first place with a time of 1 minute 47.7 seconds. This is a new Olympic record. Britain's Johnson and Norway's Boysen finished second and third with 1 minute 47.8 seconds and 1 minute 48.1 seconds, respectively.

The women's 100-meter final featured excellent sprinters who remained after several rounds of elimination from 36 athletes. Australia's Cuthbert, Matthews, and Germany's Stubnick reached the finish line almost simultaneously. Cuthbert was declared the winner with a time of 11.5 seconds, tying the Olympic record.

On the soccer field, the British team defeated the Thai team with a score of 9 to 1.

In fencing, the Italian team defeated the defending champion French team to win the team foil event. France took second place, and Hungary took third place.

Xinhua News Agency, Melbourne, November 26th: Soviet athlete and world record holder Bogdanovsky won the middleweight title in the Olympic weightlifting competition. His total score reached 420 kilograms. This is a new world record.

In the press, he broke the Olympic record of 122.5 kilograms consecutively with 125 kilograms, 130 kilograms, and 132.5 kilograms.

The second place was American P. George, whose score was 412.5 kilograms (122.5 + 127.5 + 162.5). The third place was Italian Pignatti, with a score of 382.5 kilograms (117.5 + 117.5 + 147.5). The fourth place was Poland's Bohenek (382.5 kilograms).

In the light heavyweight weightlifting final, three world records and one Olympic record were broken. The first place was American athlete Kono. He alone broke two world records and one Olympic record. One of the new world records he created was a total score of 447.5 kilograms, exceeding the previous record of 435 kilograms he created himself in 1954. Another new world record he created was a clean and jerk of 175 kilograms, exceeding the previous record of 173 kilograms created by Soviet athlete Lomakin last year. His press score was 140 kilograms, also breaking the Olympic record of 127.5 kilograms. His snatch score was 132.5 kilograms.

The second place was Soviet athlete Stepanov, with a score of 427.5 kilograms (135 + 130 + 162.5). The third place was American Jan George, with a score of 417.5 kilograms (120 + 130 + 167.5). The snatch scores of both of them (130 kilograms) were also new world records, exceeding the original world record by 1.5 kilograms.

Xinhua News Agency, Melbourne, November 26th: The men's javelin competition was the highlight of today's track and field events at the Olympic Games. After the morning preliminaries, a total of fifteen people qualified for the final, including all the athletes recognized as the best.

The final started in the afternoon, and the sky was sometimes windy, which was very unfavorable to the athletes, because the javelin would lose its balance when encountering wind in the air, affecting the result. As a result, the first place was won by the famous Norwegian athlete Danielsen, whose score was 85.71 meters, exceeding the world record of 83.66 meters created by Polish athlete Sidlo this year, and exceeding the Olympic record by 11.93 meters.

Sidlo won the second place with 79.98 meters. The Soviet Union's Tsibulenko took third place with 79.50 meters.

The fourth place was Germany's Köcher (74.68 meters), and the fifth place was Poland's Kopito (74.28 meters). The above five all broke the Olympic record of 73.78 meters.

The sixth place was Italy's Lievore (72.28 meters). (Attached picture)

    奥运会上群雄竞争激烈
    田径赛和举重涌现新纪录
    据新华社26日讯　墨尔本消息：奥林匹克运动会昨天（星期日）除了划船比赛一项外，其他比赛项目都没有进行。墨尔本的中心运动场沉静了一天之后，今天又是人山人海。
    在田径场上，上午有标枪预赛。下午，比赛的头一个项目是撑竿跳决赛。比赛结果，上届冠军美国选手理查兹以四·五六公尺的成绩保持了冠军的称号，这个成绩比他自己保持的奥林匹克纪录高一公分。
    今天的径赛中包括有男子八百公尺和女子一百公尺决赛。在八百公尺决赛中，美国的科特尼以一分四七·七秒取得第一名。这是奥林匹克的新纪录。英国的约翰逊和挪威的博伊森分别以一分四七·八秒和一分四八·一秒取得第二、三名。
    女子一百公尺决赛的选手是由三十六名选手经过几次三番的淘汰后剩下来的优秀的短跑家。澳大利亚的卡思伯特、马修斯和德国的斯图布尼克三人几乎同时到达终点。卡思伯特被宣布为第一名，成绩一一·五秒，平奥林匹克纪录。
    在足球场上，英国队以九比一战胜泰国队。
    在击剑比赛中，意大利队击败上届冠军法国队而获得了轻剑团体赛冠军，法国得亚军，匈牙利得第三名。
    据新华社26日讯　墨尔本消息：苏联运动员、世界纪录保持者鲍格达诺夫斯基赢得了奥林匹克运动会举重比赛的中量级冠军。他的总成绩达到四二○公斤。这是新的世界纪录。
    他在推举中连续以一二五公斤、一三○公斤和一三二·五公斤打破了一二二·五公斤的奥林匹克纪录。
    第二名是美国的彼·乔治，他的成绩是四一二·五公斤（一二二·五加一二七·五加一六二·五）。第三名是意大利的皮尼亚蒂，成绩是三八二·五公斤（一一七·五加一一七·五加一四七·五）。第四名是波兰的博赫内克（三八二·五公斤）。
    在轻重量级举重决赛中，共打破了三项世界纪录和一项奥林匹克纪录。第一名是美国选手科诺。他一个人就打破了两项世界纪录和一项奥林匹克纪录。他创造的一项新世界纪录是总成绩四四七·五公斤，以前的纪录是他自己在1954年创造的四三五公斤。他创造的另一项新世界纪录是挺举一七五公斤，以前的纪录是苏联运动员洛马金在去年创造的一七三公斤。他的推举成绩是一四○公斤，也打破了一二七·五公斤的奥林匹克纪录。他的抓举成绩是一三二·五公斤。
    第二名是苏联运动员斯捷潘诺夫，成绩是四二七·五公斤（一三五加一三○加一六二·五）。第三名是美国的詹·乔治，成绩是四一七·五公斤（一二○加一三○加一六七·五）。他们两人的抓举成绩（一三○公斤）也是新的世界纪录，比原来的世界纪录多一·五公斤。

    决赛在下午开始，天空有时刮风，这对运动员很不利，因为标枪在空中遇到风就会失去平衡而影响成绩。比赛结果第一名为挪威著名运动员丹尼尔森所夺得，他的成绩是八五·七一公尺，超过了波兰运动员西德洛今年创造的八三·六六公尺的世界纪录，并且比奥林匹克纪录多一一·九三公尺。

    第四名是德国的科舍耳（七四·六八公尺），第五名是波兰的科皮托（七四·二八公尺）。以上五名都打破了奥林匹克七三·七八公尺的纪录。
    第六名是意大利的利埃沃雷（七二·二八公尺）。（附图片）
