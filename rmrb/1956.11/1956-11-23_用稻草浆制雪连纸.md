Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 19th – The Tianjin No. 3 People's Paper Mill has begun to use rice straw pulp entirely as raw material to produce Xuelian paper. Although the appearance of this paper is slightly inferior, its tensile strength exceeds that of Xuelian paper made from reed pulp, and the cost per ton can be reduced by about 7.5%.

In the past, Tianjin used at most 40% rice straw pulp mixed with reed pulp as raw material for manufacturing Xuelian paper. This year, due to the insufficient supply of reed pulp, the factory experimented with using all rice straw pulp as raw material.

    用稻草浆制雪连纸
    据新华社天津19日电　天津市第三人民造纸厂开始全部用稻草浆作原料生产雪连纸。这种纸虽然外观稍差，但是拉力超过用苇浆制造的雪连纸，而且每吨成本约可降低7.5％。
    过去，天津市制造雪连纸最多在苇浆中掺用40％的稻草浆作原料。今年苇浆供应不足，这个厂就试验全部用稻草浆作原料。
