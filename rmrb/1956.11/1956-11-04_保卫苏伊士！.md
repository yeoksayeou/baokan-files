    Defend Suez!
    Cui Qi
    The eyes of the whole world are on Suez. The hearts of millions of people fly to Egypt. There, peaceful cities are suffering bombing day and night. There, the calm desert has ignited with war. There, the Anglo-French colonialists have launched a mad armed invasion against the homeland of the Suez Canal.
    What is all this for? The Anglo-French colonialists say it is for the "freedom of navigation" of the Suez Canal (!). They warn ships of all countries not to sail into Egyptian waters, for the sake of "freedom of navigation"; they launch a joint sea and air battle against Egypt, for the sake of "freedom of navigation"; they drop a large number of bombs and incendiary bombs on Cairo and Alexandria, for the sake of "freedom of navigation"; they sank Egyptian warships in the Suez Canal, blocking the canal's traffic, also for the sake of "freedom of navigation." How strange! Who exactly is hindering "freedom of navigation?" For months, the Suez Canal has been freely navigable. But the Anglo-French colonialists have been shouting "freedom of navigation" every day. And today, they are openly launching a war of aggression against Egypt under the banner of "freedom of navigation," destroying the free navigation of the Suez Canal and seriously threatening world peace. This is truly hateful!
    The Anglo-French colonialists also say that they are doing this to "stop the hostile actions between Israel and Egypt" and to "separate" them. But when the Security Council voted on a proposal for a ceasefire between Egypt and Israel, Britain and France brazenly voted against it. When Israeli troops invaded Egyptian territory, Britain and France not only did not advocate stopping Israel, but instead launched an attack on Egypt, which was being invaded, and French planes even cooperated with Israel in its attack on Egypt in the Sinai Peninsula. So that's the truth! First, Britain and France directed Israel to attack Egypt from the Sinai Peninsula, and then they themselves attacked Egypt from the Mediterranean, launching a pincer attack. This is what they call "separation"! This is truly hateful!
    The Anglo-French colonialists also say that their aggression against Egypt is only a "temporary measure." How much anger these words must arouse in the hearts of the Egyptian people. They will not forget 1882, when Britain bombarded Alexandria and seized the Suez Canal area, also claiming it was "temporary." But this "temporary" lasted for more than seventy years... Now, the Anglo-French colonialists still have the nerve to say this kind of naked lie. This is truly hateful!
    The people of the whole world are witnesses to this shameful act by Britain and France. History has recorded that these Anglo-French colonialists are treacherous aggressors and criminals who destroy peace.
    However, the Egyptian people are brave and unyielding. They are determined to take up arms and fight for the freedom of their motherland. The entire Egyptian people unanimously responded to President Nasser's mobilization order, and countless young men and women lined up in long queues in front of the conscription offices. Their slogan is: "Victory or Death." Yes, a nation that has experienced generations of colonial suffering understands the value of freedom and knows how to defend it. This is the pride and strength of Egypt. This is a powerful answer to the aggressors.
    The Anglo-French colonialists thought they had found a good opportunity to challenge the Egyptian people. But they miscalculated. In today's era, you can't find an auspicious day for colonial aggressors no matter how many calendars you look through. No matter which day they choose, they will be out of luck. The tide of defending peace and anti-colonialism is surging around the world. All peace-loving and freedom-loving people stand with Egypt. The Anglo-French colonialists have embarked on a shameful path of antagonizing the people of the whole world. Today, from Africa, from Asia, from all over the world, a huge and sacred voice has been heard: We fully support Egypt, defend Suez, and defeat the aggressors!

    保卫苏伊士！
    崔奇
    全世界的眼睛瞩望着苏伊士。千百万人民的心飞到了埃及。在那里，和平城市正日夜遭受轰炸。在那里，宁静的沙漠上燃起了战火。在那里，英法殖民者向苏伊士运河的祖国发动了疯狂的武装侵犯。
    这一切究竟为了什么？英法殖民者说，这是为了苏伊士运河的“航行自由”（！）。他们警告各国轮船不要驶进埃及海面，是为了“航行自由”；他们向埃及展开海空联合战斗行动，是为了“航行自由”；他们把大量炸弹和烧夷弹投向开罗和亚历山大，是为了“航行自由”；它们在苏伊士运河炸沉了埃及军舰，阻塞了运河的通航，也是为了“航行自由”。多么奇怪！究竟谁阻碍了“航行自由”？几个月来，苏伊士运河一直就是自由通航的。但是，英法殖民者却天天在大喊“航行自由”。而今天，他们竟打着“航行自由”的旗帜，公然发动侵埃战争，破坏了苏伊士运河的自由通航，严重威胁了世界和平，这真是可恶之至！
    英法殖民者又说，他们这样做是为了“停止以色列和埃及的敌对行动”，并为了把他们双方“隔开”。但是，当安理会表决关于以埃停火的提案时，英法竟悍然投票否决。当以色列部队侵入埃及国土时，英法不但不主张制止以色列，反而向遭到侵略的埃及发动了进攻，法国的飞机并且在西奈半岛配合以色列对埃及进攻。事实原来如此！首先，英法指使以色列从西奈半岛方面进攻埃及，然后，他们自己就从地中海方面进攻埃及，来一个左右夹攻。这就叫做“隔开”！这真是可恶之至！
    英法殖民者又说，他们对埃及的侵略行动不过是“临时性的措施”。这几个字在埃及人民的心中该引起多么大的愤怒。他们不会忘记1882年，那时候，英国炮轰亚历山大港，强占苏伊士运河区，也说是“临时的”。但这个“临时”一过就过了七十多年……。现在，英法殖民者还有脸皮说这种赤裸裸的骗人话，这真是可恶之至！
    全世界人民都是英法这种可耻行径的见证者。历史已经记下，这些英法殖民者是背信弃义的侵略者，是破坏和平的罪人。
    但是，埃及人民是英勇不屈的。他们决心拿起武器，为了祖国的自由而战斗。埃及全国人民一致响应纳赛尔总统的总动员令，无数青年和妇女在新兵征集机关的门前排成了长长的队伍。他们的口号是：“不胜利毋宁死。”是的，一个经历过世世代代殖民主义苦难的民族是懂得自由的价值的，并且懂得怎样来保卫它。这就是埃及的骄傲和力量。这就是对侵略者的有力回答。
    英法殖民者以为，他们似乎找到了一个什么好机会，可以向埃及人民挑战。但是他们计算错了。在今天的时代里，翻遍日历也不会找到殖民侵略者的吉日，不论他们选择那一天，他们都要倒霉。保卫和平和反殖民主义的浪潮磅礴于全世界，一切爱好和平与自由的人民都站在埃及一边，英法殖民者已经走上同全世界人民为敌的可耻道路。今天，从非洲，从亚洲，从全世界，已经响起了巨大的神圣的声音：我们全力支援埃及，保卫苏伊士，打败侵略者！
