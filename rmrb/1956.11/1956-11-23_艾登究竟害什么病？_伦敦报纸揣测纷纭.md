Xinhua News Agency, London, November 22nd: The focus of discussion in London newspapers these days is the British political situation following Prime Minister Eden's illness. Some newspaper commentators point out that Eden fell ill precisely at a difficult juncture for the government - when it had to consider withdrawing troops from Egypt. Other commentators suggest that Eden is suffering from "diplomatic illness," and that the real reason for his "temporary retirement" is the increasingly sharp divergence of opinions within the Conservative Party and the government regarding Britain's policy towards the Near East.

The "Daily Herald" commentator Derek Winterton emphasized that a cabinet meeting discussing the Suez issue had taken place just before Eden's illness was announced. He wrote, "It is speculated that at this meeting, the 'moderates' and those advocating a 'hard-line policy' once again disagreed over the issue of troops stationed in Port Said." It is said that Eden was in a "minority position" at this cabinet meeting, and that "even his closest friends sided against him."

Many commentators link Eden's "illness" to the series of difficulties Britain is currently encountering. They point out that Eden initially used the "guarantee" of defeating Egypt within a few days to get cabinet members to support the decision to launch the war. Now, due to Egypt's resolute resistance and the pressure of world opinion, Eden cannot fulfill his promise to occupy the Suez Canal Zone, Port Said, and Ismailia.

The war launched by Eden's cabinet is causing Britain to taste the economic consequences. In this period, extra military expenditure has cost nearly 100 million pounds. The government has attempted to make up the deficit by issuing premium bonds and cutting civil subsidies, but this has not worked. Gold and dollar reserves, which had already fallen to over $2.2 billion in October, are continuing to decline and are approaching the danger point of $2 billion. The disruption of Suez Canal traffic is causing huge difficulties for the British economy, which relies on foreign trade. In addition, three-quarters of Britain's oil is supplied by the Middle East. Britain is now experiencing a serious oil crisis, which will put British industry at risk of suspension and reduced production in the coal-short winter.

Yesterday, several major London newspapers were discussing the issue of Britain having to withdraw its troops from Egypt. "The Times" editorial wrote, "The only appropriate path now facing the British and French governments is to fulfill their promise to withdraw their troops immediately once UN forces enter (Egypt)." The "News Chronicle" believes that withdrawing British troops from Egypt, although painful, is "extremely necessary." The newspaper warned that if Britain "offends the United Nations, goes against the wishes of most Commonwealth members and the Americans, and stays by the canal, the consequences will be incalculable."

Some newspapers even frankly stated that they hoped Eden's departure due to "illness" would lead Britain to change some of its practices in the Middle East.

### 艾登究竟害什么病？  伦敦报纸揣测纷纭

    艾登究竟害什么病？
    伦敦报纸揣测纷纭
    据新华社伦敦22日电　这几天伦敦各报的讨论中心是艾登首相生病后的英国政治局势。一些报纸评论员指出，艾登恰恰在政府的困难关头——要考虑从埃及撤兵的时候害了病。另外一些评论员发表意见说，艾登生的是“外交病”，他“暂时退休”的真正原因是保守党和政府内部在英国对近东的政策上的意见分歧趋于尖锐。
    “每日先驱报”评论员德里克·温特顿强调说，就在宣布艾登生病之前，内阁举行过一次讨论苏伊士问题的会议。他写道，“据推测，在这次会议上，‘温和派’和主张实行‘强硬政策’的人在讨论军队进驻塞得港问题上又发生了分歧。”据说，艾登在这一次内阁会议上“处于少数地位”，“连他最亲密的朋友们都站在反对他的那一边”。
    许多评论员把艾登的“病”同英国目前遭遇的一系列困难联系在一起。他们指出，艾登当初是用在几天之内击败埃及的“保证”使得阁员们支持发动战争的决定的，现在，由于埃及的坚决抵抗和世界舆论的压力，艾登不能实现他的占领苏伊士运河区、塞得港和伊士美利亚的诺言。
    艾登内阁发动的战争使英国正在尝受随之而来的经济恶果。这一个时期来，额外的军事开支花去了将近一亿英镑。政府企图用发行有奖债券和削减民用补贴费的办法来弥补赤字，但是这并未奏效。10月份已经下降到二十二亿多美元的黄金美元储备还在继续下降，并且将逼近这个储备的危险点——二十亿美元。苏伊士运河通航的中断使依靠对外贸易为生的英国经济面临巨大困难。此外，英国石油的四分之三是靠中东供应的，现在，英国已经发生了严重的石油危机，它将使冬季缺煤的英国工业有停工减产的危险。
    昨天，伦敦的几家大报都在谈论英国必须从埃及撤兵的问题。“泰晤士报”社论写道，“现在摆在英法两国政府面前的唯一适当的道路是实现它们的诺言，一旦联合国部队开进（埃及），就立即撤出它们的军队。”“新闻纪事报”认为，从埃及撤走英国军队虽然是痛苦的，但却是“极端必要的”。这家报纸警告说，如果英国“得罪联合国，违背大多数英联邦成员国和美国人的愿望，留在运河旁边，其后果将是不可估计的”。
    有些报纸甚至直率的表示，希望艾登的因“病”离职会使英国改变一些对中东的做法。
