Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 20th – Shanghai began a comprehensive inspection of grain rationing work yesterday. The Municipal Grain Bureau has established a special agency to lead the work of district work groups in this inspection.

Since the third quarter of this year, some abnormal phenomena have appeared in Shanghai's grain sales. The total grain sales from July to October increased by 15.6% compared with the same period last year. Many units have not increased in number, but grain consumption has increased. Some factories and enterprises do not require new workers and temporary workers to transfer their grain supply relationships when they hire them; it is a common phenomenon that those managing meals do not collect grain coupons from those who eat with them.

During this period, the phenomenon of wasting grain has resurfaced. Many units managing meals arbitrarily discard leftover rice and steamed buns. In one hospital, more than 30 catties of rice could be recovered at one time from the ten large buckets of leftover food discarded every day.

Grain department cadres have also been more lax in implementing the grain rationing system than before, often approving applications for grain subsidies from groups and residents without review. According to preliminary understanding in 67 mess halls and more than 700 households in six districts including Putuo and Hongkou, 40% of the mess halls and 28% of the residents have surplus grain every month.

This inspection is scheduled to last for one and a half months. Shanghai's grain departments are preparing to take measures to improve grain rationing work based on the inspection situation.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 19th – Jiangxi Daily published a commentary on the 17th entitled "The Trend of Wasting Grain Must Not Rise Again," criticizing the phenomenon of wasting grain in many collective dining units in cities and agricultural cooperatives in rural areas.

The commentary said: A year ago, a "save grain, oppose waste" movement was launched throughout the province. This movement achieved great results. People regarded saving grain as a noble virtue and an act of patriotism, and many places established systems for saving grain. However, in the past two months, a more serious phenomenon of wasting grain has reappeared from cities to villages. In cities, the grain-saving systems of many collective dining units have been abolished invisibly.

In rural areas, some agricultural cooperatives and farmers have one-sidedly understood the development of sideline production and used large amounts of grain (some using rations) and state pre-purchased grain to make rice noodles, sugar, and wine. For example, the You’ai Agricultural Cooperative in Xinyu County is a grain-deficient cooperative that still needs the state to supply part of its rations, but it made more than 1,000 catties of wine from millet; the six agricultural cooperatives in Quankou Township, Shanggao County, mostly lack grain, but they also made nearly 5,000 catties of rice noodles from millet, and recently soaked nearly 3,000 catties of rice in preparation for making more. The commentary pointed out, "The re-emergence of the phenomenon of wasting grain shows that the grain departments have a one-sided and erroneous understanding of the improvement of China's grain situation. They believe that "the grain situation has improved, and there is no need to be so tight; the supply can be relaxed."

As a result, a laissez-faire attitude has been adopted towards the grain of urban residents and collective dining units, supplying as much as they want, without seriously verifying the required amount. Because grain rationing has been relaxed, some residents waste the extra grain they purchased; many collective dining units can eat without grain coupons as long as they know someone. As a result, unreasonable sales have increased sharply, exceeding the state's prescribed targets. According to statistics, grain sales in the third quarter exceeded the original plan by more than 30%.

The commentary also pointed out that although Jiangxi Province suffered from varying degrees of drought and flood this year, the total grain output is estimated to reach or exceed the level of the bumper year of 1955. If the people of the province can attach importance to saving grain as they did last year, the grain supply will not be a problem. However, if the phenomenon of wasting grain is allowed to exist and develop, causing unreasonable sales to continue to increase, then there is a possibility of a tight grain situation.

The commentary finally proposed that grain departments should promptly check and improve the shortcomings in the supply work, supply food to the people in a realistic manner, correct the relaxation phenomenon, and continue to educate the people to save grain.

    不让浪费粮食之风再起
    上海市成立专门机构检查粮食定量供应工作
    江西日报批评集体食堂和农业社的浪费现象
    新华社上海20日电　上海从昨天起全面检查粮食定量供应工作。市粮食局已成立一个专门机构，领导各区工作组进行这次检查。
    今年第三季度以来，上海的粮食销量出现了一些不正常的现象，7月到10月的粮食销售总量比去年同期增加了百分之十五点六。许多单位人数没有增加，而粮食用量上升。有些工厂、企业在吸收新工人和雇用临时工的时候，不要他们转移粮食供应关系；管理伙食的不向搭伙的人收取粮票已是较普遍的现象。
    这一时期，浪费粮食的现象又有滋长。不少单位管理伙食的任意丢弃吃剩的饭和馒头。在某一医院每天倒掉的十大桶剩饭剩菜中，一次就可捞起米饭三十多斤。
    粮食部门干部执行粮食定量供应制度也较前松懈，对申请粮食补助的团体和居民，往往不加审核就给批准。据普陀、虹口等六个区在六十七个伙食单位和七百多户居民中的初步了解，有40％的伙食单位和28％的居民每月都有多余的粮食。
    这次检查工作预定为一个半月。上海的粮食部门准备根据检查的情况，采取措施来改进粮食定量供应工作。
    据新华社南昌19日电　江西日报在17日以“浪费粮食之风不可再起”为题发表了评论，批评了目前城市中许多集体伙食单位和乡村中农业社浪费粮食的现象。
    评论说：一年以前，全省各地曾经掀起了一个“节约粮食，反对浪费”的运动。这个运动获得了很大的成果。人们把节约粮食看作是一种高尚的美德和爱国的行为，许多地方都订出了节约粮食的制度。但是，近两个月来，从城市到农村，又出现了比较严重的浪费粮食的现象。在城市里，许多集体伙食单位的节约粮食制度已经无形废除。
    在农村，有些农业社和农民片面理解了发展副业生产，大量用粮食（有的用口粮）和国家预购粮做米粉、糖和酒。如新喻县友爱农业社是个缺粮社，口粮还需国家供应一部分，但却做了一千多斤谷子的酒；上高县泉港乡的六个农业社，大部分都粮食不足，但也做了近五千斤谷子的米粉，最近又浸了近三千斤米准备再做。评论中指出，“浪费粮食现象的再度出现，说明了粮食部门对我国粮食情况的好转存在片面的、错误的认识。他们以为“粮食情况已经好转了，用不着扣得这么紧，可以放宽供应”。
    于是对城市居民和集体伙食单位的粮食，采取要多少供应多少的放任态度，不再认真核实需用量。由于粮食定量放松，有些居民就将多购粮食加以浪费；许多集体伙食单位只要认识人，不用粮票也能吃到饭。这样一来，不合理的销售量急遽增加，超过了国家规定的指标。据统计，第三季度粮食销量就超过原计划30％以上。
    评论又指出，今年江西省虽然遭到了程度不同的水旱灾害，但粮食的总产量估计可以达到或者超过丰收的1955年水平。如果全省人民都能够像去年那样重视节约粮食，粮食供应是不会成什么问题。但是，如果任凭浪费粮食现象存在和发展，使不合理的销售量不断增加，那末，就有可能发生粮食紧张情况。
    评论最后提出，要求粮食部门应该及时检查和改进供应工作中的缺点，实事求是地供应民食，纠正放松现象，并继续教育人民节约粮食。
