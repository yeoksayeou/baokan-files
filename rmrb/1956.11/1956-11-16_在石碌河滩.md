    At the Shilu River Beach
    Huang Shan
    The sun has already set behind the western hills,
    A truck is still stuck on the Shilu River beach,
    The driver is sweating profusely with anxiety,
    The engine has been running for a long time,
    The wheels are just spinning in the mud.
    From afar comes a group of Li youth hunting wild boar,
    Each wearing a short skirt,
    A steel knife tucked in the waist,
    Talking and laughing as they walk towards the riverbank.
    The driver was just about to ask them for help,
    Before he could even speak,
    The youths had already jumped into the river,
    A dozen arms working together,
    The truck was pushed forward with a "woo woo" sound.
    The driver couldn't speak the Li language,
    He could only gesture to express his gratitude,
    The youths waved their hands and said, "It's not worth mentioning, not worth mentioning,
    If it were a Kuomintang car passing by,
    We would have smashed it to pieces in the river long ago."
    Note: The Shilu River is in Dongfang County, Hainan Island. Li youths of both sexes wear short skirts; the men's short skirts are open on both sides, and the women's are open on one side. The Li people are good at hunting wild boar and usually like to tuck a short knife in their waists.

    在石碌河滩
    荒山
    太阳已经落到西山后面，
    一辆卡车仍陷在石碌河滩，
    司机急得满头大汗，
    机器发动了半天，
    车轮光在污泥里打转。
    远远来了一群打野猪的黎族青年，
    个个穿着短裙，
    一把钢刀掖在腰间，
    说着笑着走向河边。
    司机正想请他们支援，
    话还没说出口，
    青年们已跳到河里，
    十几条臂膀一齐用力，
    卡车呜呜地被推向前。
    司机不会讲黎族话，
    只能打打手势表示感谢，
    青年们摆摆手说：“值不得，值不得，
    要是过去国民党的汽车，
    我们早把它砸碎在河里了。”
    注：石碌河在海南岛东方县。黎族男女青年都穿短裙，男的短裙是左右开缝，女的是一面开缝。黎族人善于打野猪，平时腰里爱掖把短刀。
