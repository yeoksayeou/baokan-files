Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 22nd - The motor vehicle transport unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in the Lanzhou area has transported a large quantity of supplies to Lhasa this year to support the people of Tibet and the construction of Tibet. This is the first large-scale transportation after the completion of the Qinghai-Tibet Highway.

This motor vehicle unit, which had been accustomed to driving gasoline vehicles on the plains, was entirely converted to driving diesel vehicles this year and traveled long distances on the Northwest Plateau. At the beginning of the transportation, some drivers were not skilled enough and were not familiar with the roads, and the vehicles often "broke down." Many drivers had "breakdowns" on the Rubber Mountain at an altitude of 3,700 meters and the Tanggula Mountain at an altitude of 5,600 meters, and had to spend cold nights alone in the cab. After the thaw, vehicles often got stuck in the churning mud pits. Some drivers had to take off their cotton trousers and jump into the icy pits four or five times a day to rescue the stuck vehicles. On the plateau, it was not only difficult to get fresh vegetables and meat, but even the food was not easy to cook. However, the drivers still drove for more than ten hours a day.

In carrying out the transportation mission, this motor vehicle unit has produced many safe driving units and individuals. The 4th Company of a certain regiment collectively drove 600,000 kilometers safely by October 1st; 160 vehicles of a certain regiment have met the requirements for 10,000-mile safe driving.

    青藏公路建成后第一次大规模运输
    解放军汽车部队运送大批物资到拉萨
    新华社兰州22日电　中国人民解放军驻兰州地区部队的汽车运输部队，今年已经把支援西藏人民和西藏建设的大批物资运到拉萨。这是青藏公路建成后的第一次大规模运输。
    已经习惯于驾驶汽油车在平原行驶的这支汽车部队，今年全部改为驾驶柴油车，长途行驶在西北高原上。开始运输的时候，有些驾驶员技术不熟练，不熟悉道路，汽车经常“抛锚”，不少驾驶员曾经在拔海三千七百公尺的橡皮山和拔海五千六百公尺的唐古拉山上“抛锚”，只得一个人在驾驶室里度过寒冷的夜晚。开冻之后，汽车时常陷在翻浆的坑里，有的驾驶员一天曾连续四、五次脱下棉裤跳进冰窟援救被陷的汽车。在高原上不仅很难吃到新鲜菜蔬和肉类，而且连饭食都不易煮熟，但是驾驶员们仍然每天行驶十小时以上。
    这支汽车部队在执行运输任务中，涌现了许多安全行车的单位和个人。某团四连到10月1日集体安全行车了六十万公里；某团有一百六十辆汽车达到了万里安全行车的要求。
