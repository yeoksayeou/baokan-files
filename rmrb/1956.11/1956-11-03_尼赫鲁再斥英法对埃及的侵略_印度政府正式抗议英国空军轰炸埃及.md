Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, November 2nd. According to the Press Trust of India, Indian Prime Minister Nehru, speaking in Hyderabad on November 1st about the Middle East situation, said, "If there are attempts, through threats and military action, to conquer recently liberated countries and establish puppet governments there, Asian countries and other countries will absolutely not tolerate such situations or yield to such things."

He said: "Our friends are in difficulty. We cannot ignore this, we cannot lower our voices or avert our eyes. However, we do not intend to get involved in armed conflict."

Nehru said that despite differences on some points, India has friendly relations with Britain and France. But India supports the use of peaceful policies to resolve any problems.

He pointed out that the military actions in the Middle East are being called police actions. But this is a police action where troops and bombs are transported from Britain and France to attack an innocent country.

Nehru asked: "Who gave Britain and France the task of policing? In the nineteenth century, Britain and France were a kind of worldwide police force. That era has now passed, and today we are in the mid-twentieth century."

Nehru said that now some people are trying to use troops and bombs to reverse the course of history. This is dangerous. How can Asian and African countries agree to this approach?

Nehru said that Egypt has been bombed because the freedom of navigation of the Suez Canal is said to be threatened. But where did the threat come from? Certainly not from Egypt. Despite all obstacles, Egypt has strived to keep the canal open satisfactorily. If there is a threat, it is from Israel. Instead of stopping Israeli aggression, Egypt has instead been bombed. This is a strange trick.

Nehru said that we are in complete sympathy with Egypt and the Egyptian people.

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, November 2nd. The Indian government on November 1st formally protested the British Air Force's bombing of Egypt.

The protest was delivered by Indian Foreign Ministry Foreign Secretary Dutt to the British High Commissioner to India. The protest stated that such bombing violates all humanitarian considerations and will inevitably arouse great indignation in all countries, especially Asian and African countries.

An Indian government spokesman said that Prime Minister Nehru had sent a telegram to President Nasser on October 31, expressing his sympathy for Egypt's struggle and India's extreme indignation at the aggression Egypt had suffered.

    尼赫鲁再斥英法对埃及的侵略
    印度政府正式抗议英国空军轰炸埃及
    据新华社新德里2日电　据印度报业托辣斯报道，印度总理尼赫鲁11月1日在海得拉巴谈到中东局势时说，“如果是正在用威胁和军事行动来企图征服最近获得自由的国家和在那里建立傀儡政府，亚洲国家和其他国家将决不容忍这种情况和向这种事情屈服”。
    他说：“我们的朋友遭到了困难。我们不能对此不加注意，我们不能放低我们的声音或是转移我们的眼光。虽然，我们不打算卷入武装冲突中去。”
    尼赫鲁说，尽管在一些点上有分歧，印度同英国和法国是具有友好关系的。但是印度支持用和平政策来解决任何问题。
    他指出，中东的军事行动是被称为警察行动的。可是这是远从英国和法国调运来的军队和炸弹去攻击无辜国家的警察行动。
    尼赫鲁问道：“是谁给予英法以警察的任务的？在十九世纪，英国和法国曾经成为一种全世界的警察。这个时代现在已经过去了，今天我们是在二十世纪中叶。”
    尼赫鲁说，现在有人企图使用军队和炸弹来逆转历史的进程。这是危险的。亚非国家如何能同意这种作法呢？
    尼赫鲁说，埃及受到了轰炸，因为据说苏伊士运河的航行自由受到威胁。但是，威胁是从哪方面来的呢？肯定地不是从埃及来的。尽管有一切障碍，埃及还是努力使运河令人满意地畅通。如果是有威胁的话，那是从以色列来的。不但不去阻止以色列的侵略，而且使埃及反而受到了轰炸。这是奇怪的把戏。
    尼赫鲁说，我们是完全同情埃及和埃及人民的。
    据新华社新德里2日电　印度政府在11月1日正式抗议英国空军轰炸埃及。
    抗议书是印度外交部外交秘书杜特向英国驻印度高级专员提出的。抗议书说，这样的轰炸违反一切人道的考虑，并且必然会引起一切国家，特别是亚非国家的极大愤慨。
    印度政府发言人说，尼赫鲁总理已经在10月31日致电纳赛尔总统，表示他同情埃及的斗争和印度对埃及所遭到的侵略极为愤慨。
