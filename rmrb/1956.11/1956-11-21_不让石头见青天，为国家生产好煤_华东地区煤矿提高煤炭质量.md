Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 19th. According to statistics from the Jinan Bureau of the Ministry of Coal Industry, the gangue content of coal produced by state-owned coal mines in East China from January to October this year decreased by 44.5% compared with the state plan, and the ash content of raw coal decreased by 10.5% compared with the plan.

    While increasing production this year, state-owned coal mines in East China have taken various effective measures to pay attention to improving coal quality. In addition to establishing a raw coal quality inspection network and developing inspectors, all mines have generally implemented a raw coal quality reward system. Miners at the Hongshan Coal Mine in the Zibo mining area established underground gangue picking stations and put forward the slogan "Don't let stones see the sky." In the past month alone, they picked out 101 tons of gangue from raw coal. The Datong Coal Mine in Huainan, on the basis of educating workers to improve raw coal quality, revised some unreasonable deduction systems in the past, so miners paid more attention to picking stones on all working faces of coal mining, tunneling, and transportation. Because the raw coal produced by this mine was of good quality, it received a bonus of more than 3,400 yuan from users in October. The Xinwen Coal Mine, which was often fined by users in the past due to poor raw coal quality, has now received praise and rewards from users.

    不让石头见青天，为国家生产好煤
    华东地区煤矿提高煤炭质量
    新华社济南19日电　据煤炭工业部济南管理局统计，华东各国营煤矿今年1月到10月份生产的煤炭，含矸率比国家计划降低44.5％，原煤的灰分比计划降低10.5％。
    华东地区各国营煤矿今年在增加产量的同时，采取了各种有效的办法注意提高煤的质量。各矿除了建立原煤质量检查网和发展检查员以外，还普遍实行原煤质量奖励制度。淄博矿区洪山煤矿的矿工们建立了井下拣矸站，提出“不叫石头见青天”的口号，单是在最近一个月就从原煤中拣出矸石一百零一吨。淮南大通煤矿在教育工人提高原煤质量的基础上修改了过去的一些不合理的扣罚制度，因此矿工们在采煤、掘进和运输各个工作面上都更加注意拣石头。这个矿因为生产的原煤质量好，10月份曾经得到用户奖给的三千四百多元奖金。过去因为原煤质量不好常被用户罚款的新汶煤矿，现在也受到了用户的表扬和奖励。
