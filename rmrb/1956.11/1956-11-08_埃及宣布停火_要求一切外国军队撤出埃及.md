    Xinhua News Agency, November 7th, Cairo News: Cairo Radio announced to the people of Port Said today that the ceasefire would take effect at 2:00 PM local time on Wednesday. It also warned that if the enemy fired a shot or advanced an inch, Egypt had the right to resume fighting.
    The communique broadcast by Cairo Radio stated: "Britain and France have accepted the ceasefire. They previously refused a ceasefire on November 2nd, while Egypt accepted it at that time. If it were not for your heroic and tenacious defense of this city, causing the enemy to suffer severe losses, the enemy would not have accepted the ceasefire.
    You have well-maintained our country's honor, and you have also taught the two so-called great powers a severe lesson, letting them know that free people cannot be conquered.
    Let everyone know that the ceasefire will take effect at 2:00 PM local time on Wednesday.
    The ceasefire means that the enemy must remain in place. They cannot fire at anyone or advance an inch, otherwise, you can fire back and resume fighting together with your armed forces."
    Xinhua News Agency, November 7th, Cairo News: According to Cairo Radio, Egypt announced on the evening of November 6th that it agreed to a ceasefire under five conditions.
    According to the broadcast, Egypt put forward the following ceasefire conditions:
    1. The ceasefire must be implemented immediately.

    要求一切外国军队撤出埃及
    新华社7日讯　开罗消息：开罗电台今天对塞得港人民广播说，停火在星期三当地时间两点钟生效。它同时警告说，如果敌人开枪或前进一寸，埃及有权恢复战斗。
    开罗电台广播的这个文告说：“英国和法国已经接受了停火，它们以前曾在11月2日拒绝停火，而那时埃及接受了停火。如果不是由于你们英勇和顽强地保卫这个城市，使敌人蒙受严重损失，敌人是不会接受停火的。

    让你们大家知道，停火会在星期三当地时间两点钟生效。
    停火意味着，敌人必须原地不动。他们不能向任何人开枪或前进一寸，否则，你们可以同你们的武装部队一道开枪还击和重新进行战斗。”
