Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, November 23rd: The Tianjin Electromechanical Industry Bureau has invested over 300,000 yuan this year to improve the working conditions of its affiliated public-private joint venture factories, significantly reducing safety accidents in many factories. Serious injury accidents in the second quarter decreased by 9% compared to the first quarter, and the third quarter decreased by 42% compared to the second quarter.

Most of these factories were converted into public-private joint ventures at the beginning of this year. Many factories originally lacked cadres responsible for labor protection work, and some even lacked the most basic safety equipment such as protective covers and aprons. After the joint venture was established, the Tianjin Electromechanical Industry Bureau immediately assisted the factories in establishing safety technology organizations, equipped them with 87 full-time safety technicians and 581 part-time safety technicians, and established a system whereby new workers entering the factory and internal worker transfers must undergo safety technology education.

From February to now, the factories have also launched three major safety and hygiene inspections among the employees. To date, employees in various factories have identified more than 18,600 safety hazards, of which more than 18,200 have been resolved.

    改善合营企业的劳动条件
    天津机电工业局投资三十万元
    新华社天津23日电　天津市机电工业局今年投资三十万多元，改善所属各公私合营工厂的工人劳动条件，使许多工厂的安全事故显著地减少。今年第二季度重伤事故比第一季度减少了9％，第三季度又比第二季度减少了42％。
    这些工厂大部分是在今年年初公私合营的。很多工厂原来没有负责劳动保护工作的干部，有的连防护罩、围裙等最起码的安全防护用具都没有。合营以后，天津市机电工业局立即协助各厂建立起安全技术机构，配备了八十七名专职安全技术员和五百八十一名兼职安全技术员，建立了新工人入厂和内部工人调动都必须经过安全技术教育等制度。
    从2月到现在，各厂还先后发动职工进行了三次安全卫生大检查。到目前为止，各厂职工检查出来的一万八千六百多件影响安全的项目中，已经有一万八千二百多件得到解决。
