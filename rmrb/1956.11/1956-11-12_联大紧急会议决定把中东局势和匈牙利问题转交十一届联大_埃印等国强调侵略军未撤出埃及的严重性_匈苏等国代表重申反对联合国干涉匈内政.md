Xinhua News Agency, 11th Dispatch from New York: The United Nations General Assembly emergency session continued on the 10th. The session passed a suggestion by the American representative to include the Middle East situation as the primary issue on the agenda of the 11th United Nations General Assembly session, which will begin on November 12th. The session also passed, by majority vote, a suggestion by the American representative, aiming to interfere in Hungarian internal affairs, to include the so-called "Hungarian question" on the agenda of the 11th General Assembly session.

After the meeting began, American representative Lodge spoke first. He avoided discussing the urgent issue of implementing the General Assembly emergency session's resolutions regarding ceasefire and withdrawal of foreign aggressor troops, instead stating that the United Nations must handle the Palestine issue and the Suez Canal issue from a long-term perspective.

Following this, Lodge put forward an American proposal, advocating that the issues on the emergency session's agenda be included as priority issues on the provisional agenda of the 11th regular session.

Egyptian Ambassador Loutfi stated that as long as the emergency session's resolution demanding the withdrawal of foreign troops from Egypt had not been implemented, Egypt could not participate in the discussion of any political issues. Loutfi said that the General Assembly should take the measures it deems necessary. He emphasized that despite the emergency session's resolutions for an immediate ceasefire and withdrawal of aggressor troops, these resolutions had not been implemented. France, Britain, and Israel were continuing their aggression, and they were still stationing troops on Egyptian soil.

Israeli Ambassador Eban supported transferring the issue to the General Assembly and falsely claimed that the Arab countries' support for Egypt was a "threat" to Israel.

Indian representative Menon, in his speech, expressed support for the purpose of the American action but expressed doubt about its implications. He said, "The special session did not consider the internationalization of the Suez Canal... What must be done now is to restore the situation to its original state or to remedy the situation caused by the actions taken against Egypt... If there is an attempt to bring in other issues, such as the Suez Canal issue, the consent of the Egyptian government must be obtained first."

Menon said that India "cannot agree that the Suez issue is solely a matter for France, Britain, and Egypt. The canal has many users, and Britain is not the only user. My country is even more dependent on the free passage of the canal. Regarding this proposal, we agree with its purpose, that the regular session of the General Assembly must continue to consider the issues we considered at the emergency session."

He supported the view that the special session could not be held simultaneously with the regular session of the General Assembly. He said that he objected to the scope of the American proposal because no issue should be considered that would diminish the urgency of the withdrawal of foreign troops.

The representative of Saudi Arabia said that the American suggestion was an attempt to save face for the aggressors.

Under the opposition of representatives from countries such as Egypt, India, Syria, and Saudi Arabia, Lodge amended the American proposal, only saying that it requested that the Middle East issue be given priority on the provisional agenda of the regular session of the General Assembly.

After some representatives made some comments on procedural issues, the General Assembly passed the amended American proposal with sixty-six votes in favor, none against, and two abstentions (Greece and Guatemala).

The representatives of Greece and Guatemala explained that they abstained because they were not entirely convinced that the procedure was correct.

Then, discussion on the Hungarian question began immediately.

American representative Lodge again put forward the American proposal to transfer the Hungarian question to the regular session.

Hungarian representative Szabo spoke against including the Hungarian question on the agenda of the General Assembly. In his speech, he cited the declaration issued by the Hungarian Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government denying the United Nations the right to interfere in Hungarian internal affairs, pointing out that this issue was within the jurisdiction of the Hungarian government and could not be handled by the United Nations.

Italian representative Vitteeti supported the American proposal and suggested clarifying that the transfer of this item to the regular session of the General Assembly included the resolution passed by the emergency session on the Hungarian question.

Soviet representative Kuznetsov spoke against transferring the so-called "Hungarian question" to the regular session of the General Assembly. He said: "The people of the world have the right to demand that the upcoming regular session contribute to improving international relations... Thanks to the efforts of many countries advocating the maintenance of peace and security, tensions have eased since the last General Assembly. But recently, forces working to oppose any easing of tensions launched a war of aggression against Egypt, which has further complicated the situation." He said that the 11th General Assembly has a responsibility to take advantage of all existing favorable conditions to prevent forces opposing the easing of international tensions from realizing their conspiracies to harm the cause of peace.

Kuznetsov emphasized that the US, UK, and France's demand to discuss the Hungarian question was an attempt to divert world attention from the aggression against Egypt. He condemned the submission of this motion to the formal meeting as interference in Hungarian internal affairs, which did not conform to the task of realizing the lofty principles of promoting the United Nations. He said that raising this issue had another purpose, which was to promote the outbreak of counter-revolutionary riots in Hungary, promote the realization of a fascist coup there, and to use the discussion of this issue at this General Assembly to launch a movement to slander people's democratic countries and the Soviet Union, and to smear the diplomatic policies of these countries based on the principles of peaceful coexistence among nations.

The representatives of Czechoslovakia, Romania, and Bulgaria also opposed the American proposal.

Indian representative Menon announced his support for the American proposal. At the same time, he said that future discussions would either help or hinder the situation in Hungary. He said, "The primary consideration is the interests of the Hungarian people, their freedom and ability to choose a government, and the situation in Hungary, rather than the establishment of any political situation." He said that he hoped the negotiations between Hungary and the Soviet Union could be brought to a swift and satisfactory conclusion.

Menon said that as for the position of our government, there is no doubt that violence is abhorrent... but in order to avoid causing displeasure in the meeting, we will not hesitate to take an objective stance.

The General Assembly passed the American proposal on submitting the Hungarian question to the General Assembly regular meeting, including the Italian amendment, with fifty-three votes. The Soviet Union, Ukraine, Albania, Bulgaria, Belarus, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, and Romania voted against; Egypt, Greece, India, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Yemen, Yugoslavia, and Guatemala abstained.

Menon said that he abstained because it included the Italian amendment.

Egyptian Ambassador Loutfi finally reported to the General Assembly that he had received a telegram stating that the Israeli Foreign Minister had announced that Israel "has no intention of leaving the Gaza Strip, which is an inseparable part of Israel." He said: "In this way, Israel has decided not to respect the United Nations resolution requiring it to withdraw behind the armistice demarcation line. In addition, the foreign troops stationed in Egypt have not withdrawn... The provisions of the resolution have not been fulfilled, although Egypt has made its best efforts to fulfill them."

The emergency meeting adjourned at 18:25 Greenwich Mean Time.

    联大紧急会议决定把中东局势和匈牙利问题转交十一届联大
    埃印等国强调侵略军未撤出埃及的严重性
    匈苏等国代表重申反对联合国干涉匈内政
    据新华社11日讯　纽约消息：联合国大会紧急会议10日继续举行会议，会议通过了美国代表提出的把中东局势作为首要问题列入将于11月12日开幕的联合国大会第十一届会议议程的建议；会议还以多数票通过了也是美国代表提出的旨在干涉匈牙利内政的把所谓“匈牙利问题”列入大会十一届会议议程的建议。
    会议开始后，美国代表洛奇首先发言。他避而不谈执行大会紧急会议关于停火和撤退外国侵略军队的决议这个紧迫问题，而只是说，联合国必须从长期着眼来处理巴勒斯坦问题和苏伊士运河问题。
    接着，洛奇提出了美国提案，主张把紧急会议议程上的问题作为优先问题列入第十一届常会临时议程。
    埃及大使卢特菲发言说，只要紧急会议通过的要求外国军队从埃及撤退的决议还没有执行，埃及就不能参加讨论任何政治问题。卢特菲说，应该让大会来采取它认为必需采取的措施。他着重指出，尽管紧急会议通过了立即停火和撤退侵略军队的决议，但是这些决议并没有得到执行。法国、英国和以色列仍然在继续进行它们的侵略，它们仍旧把军队驻留在埃及土地上。
    以色列大使伊班支持把问题移交给大会，还诬称阿拉伯国家对埃及的声援是对以色列的“威胁”。
    印度代表梅农在发言中对美国行动的目的表示赞成，但是对行动的含义表示怀疑。他说，“特别会议并没有考虑苏伊士运河的国际化……现在必须要作的是使局势恢复原状或是补救由于对埃及采取的行动所造成的局势……要是企图把其他问题，如像苏伊士运河问题也拉进来，就必须首先得到埃及政府的同意。”
    梅农说，印度“不能够同意苏伊士问题是专门有关法国、英国和埃及的问题。运河有许多使用国，英国并不是唯一的使用国。我的国家甚至是更加有赖于运河的自由通航。就这项提案而论，我们同意它的目的是，大会常会必须继续考虑我们在紧急会议上所考虑的问题”。
    他支持特别会议不能够和大会常会同时举行的看法。他说，他对美国提案的范围提出异议是因为不应该考虑任何会减损外国军队撤出埃及的紧迫性的问题。
    沙特阿拉伯的代表说，美国的建议是要设法替侵略者挽救面子。
    在埃及、印度、叙利亚和沙特阿拉伯等国家的代表的反对下，洛奇对美国的提案作了修正，只是说要求优先把中东问题列入大会常会临时议程。
    在一些代表发表了关于程序问题的一些意见后，大会以六十六票赞成、没有反对和两票弃权（希腊和危地马拉）通过了经过修正的美国提案。
    希腊和危地马拉代表解释说，它们所以弃权，是因为不太相信这个程序是正确的。
    然后，紧接着开始了关于匈牙利问题的讨论。
    美国代表洛奇又提出了把匈牙利问题转交给常会的美国提案。
    匈牙利代表萨波发言反对把匈牙利问题列入大会议程，他在发言中引用匈牙利工农革命政府发表的否认联合国有权干涉匈牙利内政问题的宣言，指出这个问题是匈牙利政府管辖范围，不能由联合国处理。
    意大利代表维特提支持美国的提案，并且建议说明把这个项目转交大会常会时包括紧急会议就匈牙利问题所通过的决议。
    苏联代表库兹涅佐夫发言反对把所谓“匈牙利问题”转交给大会常会。他说：“全世界人民有权利要求即将举行的常会对改进国际关系作出贡献……由于竭力主张维护和平和安全的许多国家努力的结果，在上次大会以后，紧张局势已经得到缓和。但是最近，竭力反对紧张局势有任何缓和的势力发动了对埃及的侵略战争，这样使局势更加复杂了。”他说，第十一届大会有责任利用现有的一切有利条件不让反对缓和国际紧张局势的势力实现它们危害和平事业的阴谋。
    库兹涅佐夫着重指出，美英法要求讨论匈牙利问题是企图转移世界对侵略埃及的注意，他谴责把这项议案提交正式会议是对匈牙利内政的干涉，不符合实现促进联合国的崇高原则的任务。他说，提出这个问题还有另一个目的，就是促进匈牙利反革命骚乱的暴发，促进在那里实现法西斯政变，并且要在这届大会上利用讨论这个问题来发动诽谤人民民主国家和苏联，污蔑这些国家以各国人民和平共处的原则为基础的外交政策的运动。
    捷、罗、保三国的代表也反对美国的提案。
    印度代表梅农宣布支持美国提案。同时，他说今后的讨论对匈牙利的局势不是有帮助就是有妨碍。他说，“首要的考虑就是匈牙利人民的利益，他们选择政府的自由和能力以及匈牙利的状况，而不是任何政治局面的确立。”他说，他希望匈牙利和苏联的谈判能得到迅速和完满的结束。
    梅农说，至于我国政府的立场是，毫无疑问暴力是可厌的……但是为了避免在会场中引起不高兴，我们将毫不犹豫地采取客观立场。
    大会以五十三票通过了关于把匈牙利问题提交大会例行会议的美国提案，包括意大利的修正案在内。苏联、乌克兰、阿尔巴尼亚、保加利亚、白俄罗斯、捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利、波兰和罗马尼亚九个国家反对；埃及、希腊、印度、沙特阿拉伯、叙利亚、也门、南斯拉夫和危地马拉等国弃权。
    梅农说，他之所以弃权是因为其中包括了意大利的修正案。
    埃及大使卢特菲最后向大会报告说，他接到电报说以色列外交部长已经宣布以色列“不打算离开是以色列的不可分离的一部分的加沙地带”。他说：“这样，以色列已经决定不尊重要求它撤退到停战分界线的后面去的联合国决议。此外，驻在埃及的外国部队一直没有撤退……一直没有履行决议的条文，虽然埃及已经尽了最大的努力来履行它们。”
    紧急会议在格林威治时间十八时二十五分休会。
