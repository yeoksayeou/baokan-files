Dong Biwu also said that the Party and the government also call on you to use your high degree of political consciousness and labor enthusiasm, and use your practical achievements in production and work to encourage your relatives and comrades-in-arms at the front to bravely and faithfully defend the borders, coasts, and airspace of the motherland, build a modernized national defense army, and defend our great socialist construction.

    Dong Biwu concluded by saying, "I believe that the families of revolutionary martyrs, families of military personnel, disabled soldiers, and demobilized soldiers across the country will certainly respond to the call of the Party and Chairman Mao, contribute greater strength to the great cause of socialist construction, and strive for greater glory."

    Today, nearly one hundred Young Pioneers from Beijing came to the conference to offer their congratulations. They entered the venue in two groups, carrying team flags and blowing bugles, presented two large flower baskets to the conference and offered congratulatory messages.

    The conference finally adopted a congratulatory telegram to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, a congratulatory telegram to the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, and a letter to the families of revolutionary martyrs, families of military personnel, disabled soldiers, and demobilized soldiers across the country.
