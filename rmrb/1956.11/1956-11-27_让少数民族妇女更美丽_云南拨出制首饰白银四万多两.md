Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 26th - The Yunnan Provincial Branch of the People's Bank of China is progressively allocating over 40,000 taels of silver to various special districts, specifically for processing silver jewelry for ethnic minorities throughout the province. Guangnan County, which received the silver earlier, has already produced jewelry from over 2,000 taels of silver. Other special counties are also commissioning handicraft production cooperatives to begin large-scale manufacturing.

According to a responsible person from the Yunnan Provincial Branch of the People's Bank of China, in recent years, the demand for silver jewelry among ethnic minorities throughout the province has rapidly increased. Therefore, with the approval of higher authorities, the branch plans to supply large quantities of silver to various parts of the province every year in the future, as raw materials for making jewelry for ethnic minorities.

In Yunnan Province, which has a large number of ethnic groups, women of almost every ethnic minority love silver jewelry. Dai women living in the south and west particularly like to use silver chains as belts, the hats of Hani girls are covered with silver, and silver necklaces, pendants, and silver bracelets are also favored by many ethnic minority women. In various ethnic minority areas, there are many craftsmen who can process silver into various kinds of jewelry.

    让少数民族妇女更美丽
    云南拨出制首饰白银四万多两
    新华社昆明26日电　中国人民银行云南省分行正将四万多两白银陆续拨给各专区，专门为全省各地的少数民族加工银质首饰。收到白银较早的广南县，目前已经将二千多两白银制成首饰。其他各专县也正委托手工业生产合作社，开始大量制造。
    据中国人民银行云南省分行的一位负责人谈，近年来，全省少数民族需要的银质首饰的数量很快地增加了，因此分行经上级批准，计划今后每年将以大量白银供应全省各地，作为为少数民族制作首饰的原料。
    在民族众多的云南省，几乎每个少数民族的妇女们都很喜爱银质首饰。居住在南部和西部的傣族妇女特别喜欢用银练作腰带，哈尼族少女们的帽子上都镶满了白银，银项圈、项练和银手镯，更是许多少数民族妇女都喜爱的。在各少数民族地区有许多手工艺人，他们能把白银加工成各种各样的首饰。
