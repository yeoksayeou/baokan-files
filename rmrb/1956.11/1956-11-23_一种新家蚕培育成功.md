Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 20th: A new silkworm has been bred by Liu Yulin, Associate Professor, and Xu Zhifang, Teaching Assistant, and others of the Invertebrate Teaching and Research Group of the Department of Biology of Nanjing University.

This silkworm is named "Wo (San) Gai Sang." Its silk, after being test-reeled by the Zhenjiang Sericulture Research Institute and appraised by the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau, can produce 1,205 meters of raw silk from one cocoon. This is 30% longer than the silk length of one cocoon of China's finest silkworm variety. The weight of the cocoon is 39% heavier than that of ordinary Chinese silkworms.

According to three years of breeding observations, the silk spun by this silkworm is fine and has uniform evenness. The tensile strength and elongation are also very good, making it the finest raw silk for manufacturing silk fabrics. This silk is also easy to color during the dyeing process.

The "Wo (San) Gai Sang" silkworm was bred using controlled feeding methods. This is the first experiment of Michurin's scientific principle of "directed breeding" in invertebrates.

Adopting this method can advance the silkworm rearing season, avoiding conflicts between silkworm rearing time and busy farming periods.

    一种新家蚕培育成功
    据新华社南京20日电　一种新家蚕已由南京大学生物系无脊椎动物教研组的副教授刘玉麟、助教许智芳等培育出来。
    这种蚕的名字叫“莴（三）改桑”，它吐的丝经镇江蚕业研究所试缫，上海商品检验局鉴定，一粒茧可缫出一千二百零五公尺生丝。比我国最优良品种家蚕的一粒茧的丝长30％。蚕茧重量比我国一般蚕茧重39％。
    根据三年培育的情况观察，这种蚕吐的丝细并且匀度齐、丝的拉力、伸长度也都很好，是制造丝绸的最优良的生丝。在染色过程中这种丝并且容易着色。
      “莴（三）改桑”蚕是用控制饲料的方法培育出来的。这是米丘林“定向培育”的科学原理在无脊椎动物方面的初次试验。
    采用这种方法，养蚕季节可以提早，避免养蚕时间和农忙发生冲突。
