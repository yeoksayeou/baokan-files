    Sino-Soviet Friendship Blossoms on the "Great Northern Wilderness"
    Xinhua News Agency Reporter Ma Xinren
    People still remember that about two years ago, after the news was released that the Soviet Union helped our country establish a large-scale grain farm and donated a batch of machines, fifteen Soviet experts and Chinese staff arrived in the wilderness east of Jiamusi and began the construction of the State-owned Friendship Farm. At that time, what could be seen in the wilderness were: wild animals appearing and disappearing, and boundless, knee-high withered grass. But now, a large number of farmhouses have been built, grain trucks are driving in and out of the farm, a large number of personnel supporting the construction of new farms in other places have been transferred from here, and the experience of farm construction has been sent to various places. All this shows that the State-owned Friendship Farm, a symbol of the deep friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union, has been completed. This is a flower of friendship, and it embodies the tremendous hard work of the Soviet people, Soviet experts, and the Chinese people.
    An average harvest of about 3,000 catties of wheat per hectare is the result of the first year of large-scale production at the State-owned Friendship Farm. On newly reclaimed virgin land, this should be considered a good harvest. One of the important reasons for achieving this result is that Soviet experts provided many advanced production experiences suitable for Chinese soil. It is especially worth mentioning Comrade Klukov, the chief agricultural technician consultant of the farm. This expert, with twenty-eight years of farm work experience in the Soviet Union, never easily made any suggestions. He believed that agricultural production was greatly affected by local natural conditions and farming habits. Therefore, he always carefully observed the production conditions of local farmers before proposing suggestions based on Soviet experience. For example, the explanatory note attached to the land planning and design drawing arranged a fallow land system for the farm. Klukov believed that this suggestion should be revised, because Chinese farms mostly adopt a rotation system of wheat and intercropping crops such as soybeans. The cultivation of intercropping crops requires the use of machines or manual labor to eliminate weeds, so there is no need to waste land by using fallow methods. When he introduced the Soviet Union's advanced production experience, he also paid attention to making these experiences suitable for China's actual conditions. Based on the principles of the Soviet Maltsev tillage method, he suggested and personally led Chinese staff to carry out an experiment of sowing wheat on virgin land without plowing, only harrowing. This year, the 56.4 hectares of virgin land used for this experiment yielded an average of more than two tons of wheat per hectare. Because no plowing was used, the cost of reclamation was relatively low, and the soil structure was not damaged, increasing soil fertility. If this method continues to be tested and confirmed, it can be adopted on virgin land with similar land conditions in the future, which can reduce a considerable expense in our country's land reclamation work.
    This kind of Soviet internationalist spirit of considering the interests of the Chinese people everywhere has left a deep impression on the hearts of every staff member of the State-owned Friendship Farm.
    There are more than 200 tractor drivers, 180 to 190 combine harvester drivers, more than 400 farm implement operators, and 10 to 20 production team leaders and deputy team leaders on the farm. When they were first transferred to the State-owned Friendship Farm, more than 80% of them were not proficient in production technology. However, from training courses to every day's work in the fields, Soviet experts gave them enthusiastic guidance, enabling them to quickly become workers and cadres who mastered different production technologies of mechanized farms. Liu Ying, who attended the National Youth Socialist Construction Activists Conference, is now a young woman who can drive tractors and combine harvesters, and is one of the best drivers in the field this year. Before being transferred to the State-owned Friendship Farm, Liu Ying worked at the Tongbei Farm for five years, but she did not understand much about the theory of mechanical farm implements, and was helpless when the tractor broke down. From the tractor driver training class to the combine harvester driver training class at the State-owned Friendship Farm, she also received great help from Soviet expert Shabelnikov and other experts. Last year, during the wheat harvest, Shabelnikov wrote her name in Russian on the combine harvester driven by Liu Ying, and told her: "This way I can see your locomotive from afar. If your car stops, I will come to help you and ask you why you stopped." Before the wheat harvest this year, Shabelnikov returned to his country. When Liu Ying saw him off, he finally told Liu Ying: "Don't run too fast when harvesting wheat; dirt is the breeding ground for all accidents; strive to achieve the standard of 500 hectares."
    Now, the State-owned Friendship Farm not only has more than 26,000 hectares of land that have been reclaimed, 30,000 to 40,000 tons of grain have been produced, and thousands of skilled workers and cadres have been trained, but more importantly, it has established a banner for large-scale land reclamation to establish state-owned farms and spread experience. In the past two years, a large number of cadres and farmers from all over the country have come to the State-owned Friendship Farm to visit and systematically learn production and management experience. The experience of the State-owned Friendship Farm in operation and management, mechanized production, and financial systems has been promoted in more than 30 state-owned farms in Heilongjiang Province. The backbone of the wasteland surveying teams working in the north, south, east, and west of Heilongjiang Province, spanning a thousand or two thousand miles, are all land consolidation cadres trained by Soviet experts at the State-owned Friendship Farm in Harbin. These wasteland surveying team members are conducting land planning for established and to-be-established farms and advanced agricultural cooperatives. The flower of Sino-Soviet friendship has blossomed and borne fruit on this vast and fertile land of Heilongjiang.

### “北大荒”上的中苏友谊之花

    “北大荒”上的中苏友谊之花
    新华社记者　马新仁
    人们还记得，大约在两年以前，苏联帮助我国建立大型谷物农场并赠送一批机器的消息发表后，接着，十五位苏联专家和我国工作人员到达了佳木斯以东的荒地上，开始了国营友谊农场的建设工作。当时，荒地上所看到的是：出没的野兽，没膝的漫无边际的衰草。而现在，一大片农场的房屋建造起来了，农场里开出了一辆辆运粮的汽车，大批支援其他地方建设新农场的人员从这里输送出来了，农场建设的经验寄到了各地。这一切说明：象征中苏两国人民深厚友谊的国营友谊农场建成了。这是一朵友谊之花，这里凝结了苏联人民、苏联专家和中国人民的巨大的辛勤劳动。
    每公顷平均收获三千斤左右的小麦，这是国营友谊农场第一年大规模生产的成绩。在新开垦的生荒地上，这该是不算低的收成。取得这个成绩的重要原因之一，是苏联专家提供了许多适合中国土壤的先进生产经验。这里特别值得提到的是农场农业总技师顾问克鲁基科夫同志。这位在苏联有二十八年农场工作经验的专家，从不肯轻易地提出什么建议。他认为农业生产受各地的自然条件和耕作习惯的影响很大。因此，他总是在细心地观察了当地农民的生产状况以后，才结合苏联的经验提出建议来。比如土地规划设计图附带的说明书中，给农场安排了休闲地的制度。克鲁基科夫认为这个建议应该修正，因为中国农场大都采用小麦和大豆中耕作物轮种制的办法，种植中耕作物都要采用机器或人工消灭杂草，不必再采用休闲的办法浪费土地。当他介绍苏联的先进生产经验时，也注意使这些经验适合中国的实际情况。根据苏联马尔采夫耕作法的原理，他建议并且亲自领导我国工作人员进行了一种生荒地不耕翻只耙地就播种小麦的经验。进行这种试验的五十六点四公顷生荒地，今年平均每公顷收获了两吨多小麦。因为没有用犁耕翻，开荒的成本就比较低，而土壤结构不遭受破坏，增加土壤的肥力。这种办法如果继续试验肯定，它将来就可以在土地条件相类似的生荒地上采用，可以使我国开荒工作减少一笔不小的费用。
    处处为中国人民的利益着想这种苏维埃人的国际主义精神，在国营友谊农场每一个工作人员的心中都留下了深刻的印象。
    农场里有二百多名拖拉机手，一百八、九十个联合收割机驾驶员，四百多名农具手，一、二十个生产队的正副队长。当他们刚调来国营友谊农场的时候，80％以上的人生产技术不熟练。然而从训练班学习一直到田间的每一天工作，苏联专家都给他们热心的教导，使他们很快地成为掌握机械农场不同生产技术的工人和干部。曾经出席过全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会的刘瑛，现在是一个会开拖拉机又会驾驶联合收割机的女青年，是今年全场麦收成绩最好的驾驶员之一。刘瑛在调来国营友谊农场以前，曾经在通北农场工作过五年，但是有关机械农具的理论懂得不多，拖拉机一出故障就毫无办法。从国营友谊农场拖拉机手训练班到联合收割机驾驶员训练班，也得到苏联专家沙别里尼科夫和其他专家的很大帮助。去年麦收时，沙别里尼科夫在刘瑛驾驶的联合收割机上，用俄文写上她的名字，告诉她：“这样我很远就可以看见你的机车，如果你的车一停，我就来帮助你，还要质问你为什么停车。”今年麦收以前，沙别里尼科夫回国了。在刘瑛送他上车的时候，他最后告诉刘瑛说：“割麦子不要跑得太快；肮脏是一切事故的温床；争取作业达到五百标准公顷。”
    现在，国营友谊农场不仅有二万六千多公顷土地已经开垦出来，有三、四万吨粮食已经生产出来，有上千名熟练的工人和干部培养出来，而且更重要的是，它为建立国营农场大规模开荒树立了旗帜，传播了经验。两年来，国内各地有大批干部、农民来到国营友谊农场参观，系统地学习生产和管理的经验。国营友谊农场关于经营管理、机械化生产、财务制度等方面的经验，已经在黑龙江省三十多个国营农场中推广。分散在黑龙江省南北东西一两千里范围内工作的荒地勘测队的骨干，他们都是国营友谊农场苏联专家在哈尔滨训练出来的一批土地整理干部。这些荒地勘测队员正在为已经建立和将要建立的农场以及高级农业社进行土地规划。中苏友谊之花已在黑龙江这块宽广肥沃的土地上盛开和结果。
