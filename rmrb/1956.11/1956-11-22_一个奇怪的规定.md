    A Strange Regulation
    A warehouse directly under the leadership of the Wuxi Municipal Grain Bureau has such a strange regulation: except for Sundays, no one is allowed to go home to stay overnight, and national holidays are no exception. This regulation has been in place for six years, and the leaders say it is for security work. Everyone has no objection to security work, but the question is why can't other people besides those doing security work go home to stay overnight? When someone raised an opinion, they were accused of being "individualistic," having "serious family concepts," and having "hedonistic thoughts"... Recently, Zhuang Lisheng, who works in the Fifth Warehouse, stayed at home for four nights because his child was sick and no one was taking care of him. After the leaders found out, they severely criticized him and warned him that if he continued to do so, he should be careful about his "rice bowl." Xia Shicheng

    一个奇怪的规定
    直属无锡市粮食局领导的仓库，有这样一个奇怪的规定：除星期天外，任何人不得回家住宿，国家所规定的节日假期也不例外。这样的规定已经有六年了，领导上说这样作是为了保卫工作。对于保卫工作，大家都没有意见，问题是除了作保卫工作的人员以外，为什么别的人也不能回家住宿。有人提出了意见，就被指责为“个人主义”、“家庭观念严重”、“享乐思想”……。最近，在第五仓库工作的庄立生，因为孩子生病无人照顾，曾在家里住了四个晚上，领导上知道以后，就狠狠地批评了他一顿，并警告他再这样，就要当心自己的“饭碗”。　夏士成
