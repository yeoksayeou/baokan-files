Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 30th: Heilongjiang Province is continuously strengthening the planning of production collaboration among mechanical industrial enterprises. At the provincial mechanical industry production collaboration balancing meeting, which concluded on October 26, arrangements were made for the products requiring collaboration in the fourth quarter of this year and the next year from mechanical factories throughout the province. The collaboration tasks resolved at the meeting increased by about forty times compared to last year.

Before this meeting, mechanical factories in various cities and counties in the province first carried out production collaboration balancing work in their respective regions, and then submitted the problems that could not be solved in their regions and the remaining production capacity of each factory to the provincial collaboration meeting. In this way, when conducting provincial production collaboration balancing, a comprehensive consideration of the existing situation could be made. Therefore, this meeting smoothly reached agreements on several million pieces (units) of collaborative products.

With the specialization of production, various factories have put forward requirements for long-term collaboration. The state-owned Jiamusi Motor Factory needs a large number of various screws and accessories every year, and reached a long-term collaboration agreement with the F锦 County-run factory at the provincial collaboration balancing meeting. In addition, reasonable collaboration was also organized due to the different equipment capabilities and technical conditions of various regions. For example, the technical level of mechanical factories in Harbin is generally higher. At this provincial production collaboration balancing meeting, they undertook the task of collaborating on the production of some mining machinery and precision equipment needed in Jiamusi and other places, while transferring the collaborative production of small parts such as screws, which they had undertaken in the past, to some small factories. In order to carry out production collaboration work more systematically, the Industrial Office of the Provincial People's Committee is summarizing the collaboration experience gained in organizing collaboration in the past.

    黑龙江加强机械工业生产上的协作
    新华社哈尔滨30日电　黑龙江省机械工业企业生产协作的计划性正在不断加强。10月26日结束的全省机械工业生产协作平衡会议上，对全省各地机械工厂今年第四季度和明年生产中需要协作的产品作了安排。经过会议解决的协作任务比去年增加了四十倍左右。
    这次会议召开以前，全省各市、县的机械工厂首先进行了本地区的生产协作平衡工作，然后把本地区不能解决的问题和各厂剩余的生产能力提到全省协作会议。这样，在进行全省性的生产协作平衡时，就能对现有情况作通盘考虑。因此，这次会议顺利地达成了几百万件（台）协作产品的协议。
    随着生产的专业化，各厂提出了长期协作的要求。国营佳木斯电机厂每年需要大量的各种螺丝，配件，经全省性的协作平衡会议上与富锦县的县营工厂达成了长期协作的协议。此外，各地区因设备能力和技术条件的不同，也组织了合理的协作。如哈尔滨市机械工厂的技术水平一般较高，这次全省性的生产协作平衡会议上，承担了协作一些矿山机械和佳木斯等地需要的精密的设备的制作任务，而把过去承担协作的制作螺丝等小件产品交由一些小厂承制。为了更有计划地开展生产协作工作，省人民委员会的工业办公室正在总结过去在组织协作中取得的协作经验。
