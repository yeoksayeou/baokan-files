As Vice Chairman of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, I solemnly declare on behalf of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and hundreds of thousands of literary and art workers across the country: We are twelve thousand times disgusted with the unprecedented and barbaric aggression of British and French imperialism against Egypt. We firmly oppose the acts of British and French imperialism that undermine world peace. We express our highest respect to the Egyptian people who are bravely resisting aggression and defending the independence and freedom of their motherland. We tell the Egyptian people and the Egyptian literary and art circles that we fully support you.

We would also like to tell the kind, peace-loving people of Britain and France: your government's act of aggression violates the interests and will of your people. Your government's act of aggression has aroused worldwide public outrage. All kind, peace-loving British and French people, you have a responsibility to rise up and stop this bloody act of aggression that is hated by everyone! British and French literary and art figures who have produced Shakespeare, Rousseau, Bernard Shaw, and Romain Rolland, you are literary and art workers who inherit the traditions of freedom and democracy of your ancestors, you must feel ashamed of your government's act of aggression that undermines world peace and tramples on Egyptian sovereignty. We Chinese literary and art workers hope that you will exert your excellent traditions of freedom and democracy, exert your spiritual strength, wash away this shame, and stop such a barbaric and blatant act of aggression!

Chinese literary and art workers stand with the Chinese people and fully support the just struggle of the Egyptian people!

Long live the heroic Egyptian people who are fighting for independence and freedom!

The just cause will surely achieve final victory, long live the just struggle of the heroic Egyptian people!

    茅盾的讲话
    我代表中国文学艺术界联合会以及全国数十万的文艺工作者郑重表示：我们十二万分憎恨英法帝国主义的史无前例的蛮横的对埃及的侵略。我们坚决反对英、法帝国主义的破坏世界和平的行为。我们对于英勇地抵抗侵略、保卫祖国的独立自由的埃及人民，表示崇高的敬意。我们告诉埃及人民和埃及的文艺界，我们是全力支持你们的。
    我们也愿意告诉英国和法国的善良的爱好和平的人民：你们的政府的侵略行为，是违反了你们人民的利益和意志的。你们政府的侵略行为，已经激起了全世界的公愤。一切善良的爱好和平的英国人和法国人啊，你们有责任起来制止这种为人人所痛恨的血腥的侵略行为！产生了莎士比亚、卢骚、萧伯纳、罗曼·罗兰的英国和法国的文艺界人士啊，你们是继承着你们祖先的自由和民主传统的文艺工作者，你们对于你们政府的破坏世界和平、蹂躏埃及主权的侵略行动，一定会感到耻辱。我们中国的文艺工作者盼望你们发挥你们的自由、民主的优秀传统，发挥你们的精神力量，洗涤这种耻辱，制止这样蛮横露骨的侵略行动！
    中国文艺工作者和中国人民一道，全力支持埃及人民的正义斗争！
    为了独立和自由而斗争的英勇的埃及人民万岁！
    正义的事业必然取得最后胜利，英勇的埃及人民的正义斗争万岁！
