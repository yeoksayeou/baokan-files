All parts of the country are actively preparing to commemorate the 90th anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's birth and have already launched many commemorative activities. The enthusiasm is high and the scale is unprecedented. This is, of course, because the Chinese people have gained freedom and happiness, and cherish infinite memories and respect for this great democratic revolutionary and patriot who fought for the freedom and equality of the motherland throughout his life. More importantly, after liberation, our national leaders, Chairman Mao Zedong, Chairman Liu Shaoqi, etc., gave extremely high historical evaluations of Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary cause, and it has become possible for the general public to freely and comprehensively study Mr. Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary thoughts and spirit. This has made the people of the whole country more aware of the brilliance of Sun Yat-sen's career and the greatness of his personality, thereby increasing their admiration for this great revolutionary and patriot. As everyone knows, before liberation, the Kuomintang regime, although reciting "Premier's Testament," was actually going against it, just as Sun Yat-sen criticized the Yunnan warlords: "You wear my hat and trample on my hometown." This dark politics obscured the brilliance of Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary cause and revolutionary thought, which once made Sun Yat-sen's followers feel extremely angry!

The best way to commemorate a revolutionary is to implement his revolutionary propositions and promote his revolutionary spirit. Sun Yat-sen embraced extremely lofty revolutionary ideals and fought for their realization throughout his life. There are many things we need to learn from him, but I think the most important aspects are:

First, Sun Yat-sen was a staunch patriotic and anti-imperialist fighter. He was born in 1866, precisely when imperialism was intensifying its aggression against China. At that time, the Qing government not only cruelly oppressed the people domestically but also completely lost its ability to resist imperialist aggression externally, and gradually became a tool of the imperialists. Therefore, after the defeat in the Sino-French War, Sun Yat-sen was determined to overthrow the Qing Dynasty and establish a republic. As everyone knows, Sun Yat-sen waged an indomitable struggle to realize this ideal. After ten failures, he finally achieved the great victory of the Xinhai Revolution in 1911, ending more than two thousand years of feudal monarchy.

The Xinhai Revolution, which overthrew the Qing government, went against the will of the imperialists. Therefore, the imperialists used military and financial power to oppress the Nanjing Provisional Government led by Sun Yat-sen and helped Yuan Shikai achieve victory. After the Xinhai Revolution, the struggle against the warlords led by Sun Yat-sen was also directly and indirectly sabotaged by imperialism. The imperialists and their lackeys attempted to force Sun Yat-sen to abandon his aspiration to save China, but Sun Yat-sen was determined to fight for China's independence and freedom. In 1917, the great socialist October Revolution took place in Russia, and in 1921 the Chinese working class established its own political party, the Chinese Communist Party. Sun Yat-sen finally found a powerful force capable of confronting imperialism. He pointed out: "After the Russian revolution, what ideas did the Slavic nation produce? They advocate supporting the weak and suppressing the strong, helping the poor and relieving the rich, and are dedicated to fighting for justice and against injustice in the world." He declared that he was a friend of socialism and bravely adopted the revolutionary three major policies of alliance with the Soviet Union, alliance with the Communist Party, and support for the workers' and peasants' movements. At the First National Congress of the reorganized Chinese Kuomintang, he clearly formulated a program of action against imperialism and feudalism. In 1924, when British imperialism instigated the Guangzhou Merchant Corps to rebel, Sun Yat-sen resolutely suppressed them and issued a declaration to foreign countries saying: "There was a period in the past when we worked hard to overthrow the Manchus. Now we will begin a period of working hard to overthrow imperialist interference in China and eliminate the greatest obstacle in the historical task of completing the revolution." In the "Northern Expedition Declaration," he further emphasized: "The aim of the national revolution is to create an independent and free nation to safeguard the interests of the nation and the people. This aim is absolutely incompatible with imperialism's desire to make China a permanent colony." He also said: "The aim of the Northern Expedition is not only to overthrow the warlords but also to overthrow the imperialism on which the warlords depend for their survival." From this, it can be seen how thorough Sun Yat-sen's understanding of imperialism was and how firm his determination to oppose imperialism was!

Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people, as Sun Yat-sen hoped on his deathbed, have received the sympathy and assistance of the Soviet Union and have completely realized Sun Yat-sen's ideal of striving for national independence and freedom. Now we are doing an extremely glorious and great cause that our predecessors have never done before, to build our country into a great socialist country. But we must not forget that American imperialism still occupies our territory of Taiwan and hinders our motherland from achieving complete unification. To commemorate Sun Yat-sen, we must promote Sun Yat-sen's patriotic and anti-imperialist revolutionary spirit and actively fight for the liberation of Taiwan and against imperialist aggression!

Second, Sun Yat-sen greatly yearned for a world of "the Great Way prevails, the world is for all," so he consistently hated the exploitation of the majority by the minority and the bullying of small countries by large countries. In his later years, he even more yearned for the arrival of a socialist society.

As early as 1905, in the inaugural speech of "Min Bao," Sun Yat-sen criticized those who were obsessed with imitating Europe and the United States, saying: "In recent times, people with lofty ideals have exhausted their tongues, only seeking to strengthen China to be like Europe and the United States. However, Europe and the United States are strong, but their people are indeed in distress. Looking at the widespread strikes and the increasingly intense activities of anarchists and socialists, social revolution is not far away." In a speech commemorating the anniversary of the publication of "Min Bao," he further pointed out: "In European and American countries, the fruits of good fortune are enjoyed by the rich, while the poor eat the bitter fruits. This is all because a minority of people control civilization and happiness, thus creating this unequal world."

Based on the ideas of "liberty, equality, and fraternity," Sun Yat-sen, while opposing the exploitation of the poor by the rich, hated even more the invasion of weak countries by strong countries and the oppression of small countries by large countries. He angrily condemned the imperialist aggression against Asia, saying: "They use a minority of people to suppress the majority in this continent and their own countries, and even extend this kind of poison to Asia to enslave our nine hundred million majority. This is truly very cruel and extremely hateful!" Therefore, he more than once hoped that the oppressed nations of Asia could unite and jointly carry out the struggle for national independence, "not to be colonies of Europe, but to be masters of Asia!"

The success of the Russian October Socialist Revolution made Sun Yat-sen see "a great hope for mankind." He pointed out that Russia after the revolution "not only has no ambition to invade other countries, but also supports the weak and suppresses the strong, upholds justice; ... not only broke the Russian imperialism, but also broke the world imperialism; not only broke the world imperialism, but also broke the world capitalism." Therefore, Sun Yat-sen praised Lenin as a "revolutionary saint" and more than once pointed out that China "must learn from Russia today in revolution," and "there will be no success in future revolutions without taking Russia as a teacher." He told a Japanese newspaper reporter in Nagasaki: "The purpose of the Chinese revolution is the same as that of Russia... The Chinese and Russian revolutions are taking the same path, so China and Russia are not just friendly, but actually one family in terms of revolutionary relations."

In the thirty years since Sun Yat-sen's death, the world situation has undergone fundamental changes. Our China, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and many countries in Eastern Europe have all embarked on the path of socialism; many nations in Asia and Africa have shaken off the shackles of colonialism, become independent countries and yearn for socialism; the anti-colonial national independence movement has become an unstoppable trend. In our country, the socialist revolution has achieved a decisive victory, fundamentally eliminating the phenomenon of people exploiting people, all nationalities are equal, and the people enjoy full democratic freedom. The society of "the young are cared for, the old are provided for" that our ancestors dreamed of has become a reality in our lives. This is what we can tell Sun Yat-sen today in commemorating him. We must further strengthen socialist construction and strive to build our country into a great socialist country as soon as possible; and we must support all progressive causes of mankind with all our strength!

Third, Sun Yat-sen loved peace and opposed war. He pointed out that the Chinese people are the most peace-loving in the world, and "Chinese people have always not considered 'fighting well' as good, and those who talk about fighting are barbaric." Everyone knows that Sun Yat-sen firmly opposed the Beiyang government's participation in World War I against the will of the people of the whole country. He pointed out that World War I was nothing but an imperialist war, and the so-called "Entente" and "Allied Powers" were just birds of a feather, "Isn't the Entente a power with no justice!" In terms of domestic issues, although Sun Yat-sen insisted on the revolutionary position, he never gave up seeking a peaceful solution to the country's problems. He once warned the warlords who occupied and divided the country: "The will of the people is to be feared, and those who do not restrain themselves will be burned!" In 1925, in order to strive for the realization of peaceful reunification, Sun Yat-sen went north at the risk of his life. On his deathbed, he repeatedly shouted, "Peace, struggle, save China!"

Although Sun Yat-sen loved peace, he did not oppose all wars indiscriminately, and he never succumbed to any threat of force. Sun Yat-sen believed that the wars of resistance against aggression by oppressed nations were just and believed that such struggles would surely be victorious. In 1924, when he passed through Nagasaki, Japan, on his way north, a Japanese reporter asked him: "Now there is a saying in foreign countries about the strong co-management of China. Can it become a reality?" Sun Yat-sen replied without hesitation: "It will never become a reality. Because the Chinese people have a stronger resistance, the saying of co-managing China is a foreign dream." As everyone knows, in August 1924, British imperialism instigated the Guangzhou Merchant Corps to launch a rebellion, and the British government threatened "the British navy will take action immediately." Sun Yat-sen's response was to resolutely suppress the Merchant Corps by force and sternly warn Britain not to interfere.

Sun Yat-sen had a very important idea, which was that a strong China is an important factor in maintaining peace in the Far East and the world. As early as 1904, Sun Yat-sen refuted the fallacy that China would retaliate and invade after becoming rich and strong. He pointed out that the entire purpose of this propaganda was to "try to suppress the Chinese people," which was absurd, and told the world that the Chinese people "are by no means a bellicose nation, so they sometimes have wars only out of self-defense,... If the great powers do not interfere with them, they can become the most peaceful nation in the world." Sun Yat-sen further pointed out that "after the Chinese revolution achieves its goal, not only will our splendid country open a new era, but all mankind will also get a bright situation. World peace will surely be realized with the Chinese revolution. There will also be an unimaginable blessed land in the social and economic activities of this bright world." Sun Yat-sen's view at the time was of course mainly based on the Chinese people's peace-loving national character. Today's People's Republic of China is a socialist country, which further guarantees from the social system China's firm position in safeguarding peace and opposing aggression; striving for world peace and human progress is our country's unwavering policy in international affairs. In the past few years, we have actively participated in various international activities that are beneficial to world peace and actively developed economic and cultural exchanges with the people of all countries. With the development of China's economy and culture, our China will, as Sun Yat-sen hoped, make greater and greater contributions to world peace and human welfare. This is a goal we are striving for and a fact that no one can doubt.

Fourth, Sun Yat-sen was great not only because he fought tirelessly for decades, without surrendering or compromising, but also because he was able to temper and develop his own thoughts in actual struggle, so that his thoughts could keep pace with the times and move forward continuously.

We know that Sun Yat-sen also had the idea of implementing some reforms through the Qing government in his early years, but when he saw the reactionary and corrupt nature of the Qing government, he resolutely announced that he would overthrow the Qing government and launched an irreconcilable struggle with the reformists represented by Kang Youwei. In Chinese history, the first person to propose the ideal of establishing a republic was Sun Yat-sen. The Russian October Socialist Revolution was not only subjected to barbaric interference by imperialism, but many people at the time did not yet recognize its great significance. However, as soon as Sun Yat-sen heard the news of the success of the Russian Revolution, he sent a telegram of congratulations, which was the first congratulatory telegram that the Soviet Union received from foreign people. Sun Yat-sen was dissatisfied with the bourgeois democratic politics of Europe and the United States very early on. When the Russian October Revolution succeeded, he decided to "take Russia as a teacher" and believed that "the French and American republics are old-fashioned, and only Russia is new-fashioned today. We should create a newest-style republic today." As Chairman Mao Zedong pointed out, "Sun Yat-sen was great not only because he led the great Xinhai Revolution (although it was a democratic revolution of the old era), but also because he was able to 'adapt to the trend of the world and meet the needs of the people,' put forward the three major revolutionary policies of alliance with Russia, alliance with the Communist Party, and support for the peasants and workers, made new interpretations of the Three People's Principles, and established the New Three People's Principles of the Three Great Policies." He also said: The basic principles of the Three People's Principles explained by Sun Yat-sen in the 1924 "Declaration of the First National Congress of the Chinese Kuomintang" are consistent with some basic principles of our party's program at the current stage, namely the minimum program. From this scientific historical evaluation by Chairman Mao Zedong, we can recognize the height reached by the forward development of Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary thought.

Sun Yat-sen fought for the revolution for forty years and went through countless tortuous roads, but he was always moving forward; where did this constant progressive force come from? It lies in his love for the motherland and his love for the people. Now our motherland is developing rapidly, and in order to keep our thoughts from lagging behind reality, we must strive to emulate Sun Yat-sen's spirit of continuous progress!

The great Sun Yat-sen left behind rich revolutionary thoughts and struggle experiences in his forty years of struggle. What is said here is only some of the parts that I personally think are most important. I hope that through commemorating the 90th anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's birth, all aspects can conduct more comprehensive and detailed research on Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary thoughts, career, and experience in the future. Chairman Mao Zedong taught us: "Today's China is a development of historical China; we are Marxist historicists, and we should not sever history. From Confucius to Sun Yat-sen, we should summarize and inherit this precious heritage."

    向伟大的孙中山先生学习
    李济深
    全国各地都在积极筹备纪念孙中山先生诞辰九十周年，并且已经展开了许多的纪念活动，热情之高，规模之大，都是前所未有的。这当然由于中国人民已经得到了自由和幸福，对于这位为争取祖国之自由平等奋斗了一生的伟大民主革命家和爱国者是怀着无限的追思和崇敬的。更重要的是：解放以后，我们国家的领导人毛主席、刘少奇委员长等对于孙中山先生的革命事业给了极崇高的历史评价，而一般人也有了可能来自由而全面地研究中山先生的革命思想和精神，这就使得全国人民更加认识了孙中山先生事业的光辉和人格的伟大，从而也就更为增进了对这位伟大的革命家和爱国者的敬仰。大家知道，解放以前，国民党政权虽然口诵“总理遗嘱”，实在是背道而驰，正如孙中山先生斥责滇军军阀时所说的情况一样：“你们戴着我的帽子，践踏我的家乡。”这种黑暗政治掩盖了孙中山先生革命事业与革命思想的光辉，曾经使孙中山先生的信徒感到极大的愤怒！
    对一个革命家最好的纪念就是贯彻他的革命主张，发扬他的革命精神。孙中山先生怀抱着极其崇高的革命理想，并且为它们的实现战斗了一生，我们需要向他学习的地方很多，但是我认为最重要的有以下几个方面：
    第一，孙中山先生是一个坚强的爱国反帝的战士。他诞生于1866年，正是帝国主义加紧侵略中国的时候。当时清朝政府对内残酷地压迫人民，对外不仅完全丧失了抵抗帝国主义的侵略的能力，而且逐渐变成帝国主义者的工具，所以中法战争失败以后，孙中山先生就下定了推翻清廷、建立民国的决心。大家知道：孙中山先生为实现这个理想，进行了不屈不挠的斗争；经过十次失败，终于在1911年取得了辛亥革命的伟大胜利，结束了两千多年的封建帝制。
    推翻清朝政府的辛亥革命是违反帝国主义的意愿的，所以帝国主义者就利用军事和财政的力量，压迫以孙中山先生为首的南京临时政府，而帮助袁世凯取得了胜利。辛亥革命以后，孙中山先生领导的反对军阀的斗争，同样受到帝国主义的直接间接的破坏。帝国主义及其走狗们企图压迫孙中山先生放弃救中国的志愿，而孙中山先生是坚决要为中国的独立自由而斗争。1917年俄国发生了伟大的社会主义十月革命，1921年中国工人阶级成立自己的政党中国共产党，孙中山先生终于找到了能够对抗帝国主义的强大力量。他指出：“俄国革命以后，斯拉夫民族生出了什么思想呢？他们主张抑强扶弱，压富济贫，是专为世界上主张公道打不平的。”他宣布他是社会主义的朋友，勇敢地采取了联合苏联、联合共产党、扶助工人运动农民运动的革命三大政策，在改组后的中国国民党第一次全国代表大会上，明确制定了反帝反封建的行动纲领。1924年英帝国主义指使广州商团叛变，孙中山先生坚决加以镇压，并发表对外宣言说：“从前有一时期为努力推翻满清，今将开始一时期，为努力推翻帝国主义之干涉中国，扫除完成革命之历史的工作中之最大障碍。”在“北上宣言”中，他更强调地指出：“国民革命之目的，在造成独立自由之国家，以维护国家及民众之利益。此种目的与帝国主义欲使中国永为其殖民地者绝对不能相容。”又说：“北伐之目的，不仅在推倒军阀，尤在推倒军阀所赖以存生之帝国主义。”由此可见，孙中山先生对于帝国主义的认识是何等透彻，反对帝国主义的决心更是何等坚决！
    中国人民在中国共产党的领导下，正如孙中山先生临终所期望的，得到苏联的同情和协助，已经完全实现了孙中山先生争取国家的独立自由的理想，现在我们正在做着我们前人从来没有做过的极其光荣伟大的事业，要把我国建设成为一个伟大的社会主义国家。但是我们不能忘记美帝国主义还霸占着我国的领土台湾，阻挠我们祖国实现完全的统一，我们纪念孙中山先生，必须发扬孙中山先生爱国反帝的革命精神，积极为解放台湾、反对帝国主义侵略而斗争！
    第二，孙中山先生非常向往于一个“大道之行也天下为公”的大同世界，所以他一贯痛恨少数人剥削多数人，大国欺凌小国，到了他的晚年，更十分渴望社会主义社会的到来。
    远在1905年，孙中山先生在“民报”发刊词中就批评当时醉心想效法欧美的人士说：“近时志士，舌敝唇枯，惟企强中国以比欧美。然而欧美强矣，其民实困。观大同罢工与无政府党，社会党之日炽，社会革命，其将不远。”在“民报”发刊周年纪念的演讲中，更指出：“欧美各国，善果被富人享尽，贫民反食恶果，总由少数人把持文明幸福，故成此不平等世界。”
    孙中山先生基于“自由、平等、博爱”的思想，在反对富人剥削穷人的同时，更憎恨强国侵略弱国，大国压迫小国。他曾愤怒地谴责帝国主义对亚洲的侵略说：“他们用少数人既压制了本洲和本国的多数人，更把那种流毒推广到亚洲来压我们九万万的大多数，做他们少数人的奴隶，这真是非常残酷，真是可恶已极！”所以他不止一次地希望亚洲被压迫的民族能够联合起来，共同进行争取民族的独立运动，“不做欧洲的殖民地，要做亚洲的主人翁！”
    俄国十月社会主义革命的成功，使孙中山先生看见了“一个人类中的大希望。”他指出革命后的俄国“不但是没有侵略各国的野心，并且抑强扶弱，主持公道；……不但是打破俄国的帝国主义，并且是打破世界的帝国主义；不但是打破世界的帝国主义，而且是打破世界的资本主义。”所以孙中山先生誉列宁为“革命的圣人”，不止一次的指出：中国“今日革命非学俄国不可”，“今后之革命，非以俄为师，断无成就。”他对长崎日本新闻记者说：“中国革命的目的，和俄国相同。……中国和俄国革命都是走一条路，所以中国同俄国不只是亲善，照革命的关系实在是一家。”
    孙中山先生逝世以后的三十年间，世界形势已经发生了根本的变化。我们中国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国，越南民主共和国以及东欧许多国家，都先后走上了社会主义的道路；亚洲和非洲许多民族已经摆脱了殖民主义的束缚，成为独立国家并向往于社会主义；反殖民主义的民族独立运动已经成为一个不可阻挡的潮流。在我国，社会主义革命已经取得了决定性的胜利，基本上消灭了人剥削人的现象，各民族一律平等，人民享受着充分的民主自由，我们先人所理想的“幼有所长，老有所终”的社会，已经成为我们生活中的现实了。这是我们今天纪念孙中山先生而可以告慰于孙中山先生的。我们要进一步加强社会主义建设，争取早日把我国建设成为一个伟大的社会主义国家；并且要以全力来支持人类的一切进步事业！
    第三，孙中山先生是热爱和平反对战争的，他指出中国人民是世界中最爱和平的，“中国人的心理向来不以‘打得’为然，以讲打的就是野蛮”。大家知道孙中山先生是坚决反对北洋政府违反全国人民的意志参加第一次世界大战的，他指出第一次世界大战不过是帝国主义的战争，所谓“协商国”与“同盟国”不过是一丘之貉，“协商国岂非有强权无公理者乎！”就国内问题来说，孙中山先生虽然坚持革命的立场，但从来不放弃寻求和平解决国是的途径。他曾警告拥兵割据的军阀说：“民意可畏，不戢自焚！”1925年，孙中山先生为了争取实现和平统一，不惜冒险北上，弥留之际，还反复喊着“和平，奋斗，救中国！”
    孙中山先生虽然热爱和平，但不是无区别的反对一切战争，更从来不屈服于任何武力的威胁。孙中山先生认为被压迫的民族反抗侵略的战争是正义的，并相信这种斗争一定能够得到胜利。1924年，他在北上途中经过日本长崎的时候，有日本记者问他：“现在外国对中国有强硬共管之说，能否成为事实？”孙中山先生毫不犹豫地回答说：“决不能为事实。因为中国国民更有强硬之抵抗，共管中国之说，是外国作梦。”大家知道，1924年8月英帝国主义策动广州商团发动叛变，英国政府且威胁“英国海军立即行动”，孙中山的答复是坚决以武力镇压商团，并严词警告英国不得干涉。
    孙中山有一个很重要的思想，就是认为一个强大的中国，是维持远东及世界和平的重要因素。远在1904年，孙中山先生就驳斥了那种所谓中国富强以后将进行报复和侵略的谬论，他指出这种宣传整个的目的无非想“竭力压制中国人”，是荒诞不经的，并且告诉全世界，中国人民“决不是一个好斗的民族，所以他们不得已而有时发生战争，也是完全出于自卫的缘故，……倘使列强不干涉他们，他们就可以成为全世界最和平的民族”。孙中山先生更指出“在中国革命达到目的之后，那时不单我们灿烂的国家开一新纪元，就是全人类也将得到一个光明的局面。全世界的和平，必定将跟中国的革命而实现出来。在这光明世界的社会和经济活动上，也将有一个梦想不到的福地。”孙中山先生当时提出这种看法，当然主要是就中国人民爱好和平的民族性格来说的。今天的中华人民共和国是一个社会主义国家，更从社会制度上保证了中国坚决维护和平反对侵略的立场；为世界和平和人类进步事业而努力，是我国在国际事务中坚定不移的方针。在过去几年中，我们积极参加了有益于世界和平的各种国际活动，积极发展了同各国人民的经济、文化交流。随着中国经济、文化的发展，我们中国必将如孙中山先生所期许的，对于世界和平和人类福利做出越来越大的贡献。这是我们努力的一个目标，也是一个不容任何人怀疑的事实。
    第四，孙中山先生之所以伟大，不仅因为他几十年奋斗不懈，不屈服，不妥协，更重要的是，他能够在实际斗争中锻炼和发展自己的思想，使自己的思想能够跟着时代不断地向前进。
    我们知道，孙中山先生早年也曾有过通过清朝政府实行一些改良的想法，但是当他看清楚了清朝政府反动腐败的本质以后，他就毅然宣布要推翻清朝政府，并且同以康有为为代表的改良派展开不调和的斗争。在中国历史上，第一个提出建立共和国理想的，就是孙中山先生。俄国十月社会主义革命，不仅受到帝国主义的野蛮干涉，而许多人士在当时还没有认识它的伟大意义，可是孙中山先生一听到俄国革命成功的消息，即致电祝贺，那是苏联接到来自外国人民的第一封贺电。孙中山先生很早就不满欧美资产阶级的民主政治，当俄国十月革命成功后，他就决定要“以俄为师”，认为“法美共和国皆旧式的，今日惟俄国为新式的，吾人今日应造成一最新式的共和国。”正如毛泽东主席所指出的“孙中山先生之所以伟大，不但因为他领导了伟大的辛亥革命（虽然是旧时期的民主革命），而且因为他能够‘适乎世界之潮流，合乎人群之需要’，提出了联俄、联共、扶助农工三大革命政策，对三民主义作了新的解释，树立了三大政策的新三民主义。”又说：孙中山先生在1924年“中国国民党第一次全国代表大会宣言”所解释的三民主义的基本原则，同我党在现阶段的纲领，即最低纲领的若干基本原则，是互相一致。从毛泽东主席这个科学的历史评价，我们可以认识孙中山先生的革命思想向前发展所达到的高度。
    孙中山先生为革命奋斗了四十年，经过了无数曲折的道路，然而他总是不断前进的；他这种不断进步的力量是从哪里来的呢？就在于他热爱祖国，热爱人民。现在我们祖国正在一日千里地向前发展，我们要使自己的思想不落后于实际，必须努力效法孙中山先生不断进步的精神！
    伟大的孙中山先生在他四十年的奋斗中，遗留了丰富的革命思想和斗争经验，这里所说的只是我个人认为最重要的一些部分。我希望通过纪念孙中山先生诞辰九十周年，今后各方面对于孙中山先生的革命思想、事业和经验能够进行更全面而详细的研究。毛泽东主席教导我们：“今天的中国是历史的中国的一个发展；我们是马克思主义的历史主义者，我们不应当割断历史。从孔夫子到孙中山，我们应当给以总结，承继这一份珍贵的遗产。”
