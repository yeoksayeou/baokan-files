Xinhua News Agency, November 22nd dispatch: According to TASS reports: The Kuibyshev-Moscow high-voltage transmission line in the Soviet Union has been fully completed. Its second circuit was completed in mid-November and has already begun supplying power to Moscow.

The Kuibyshev-Moscow high-voltage transmission line is the first part of the unified power grid of the European part of the Soviet Union stipulated in the Soviet Sixth Five-Year Plan. Its second circuit is located north of the first circuit, which was completed at the end of April this year, and is parallel to it. The two circuits are 1,860 kilometers long and both have a voltage of 400,000 volts. The steel columns supporting this unparalleled high-voltage transmission line total 4,000, each 27 meters high and weighing 16 tons.

Xinhua News Agency, November 21st dispatch: According to TASS reports: Soviet coal mining enterprises have mined nearly 10 million tons more coal for the country in the two months from September 1st to November 7th than in the same period last year. Such a high production record is a first in the history of the Soviet coal mining industry.

Deputy Minister of the Coal Industry Department, Trukh, pointed out to TASS reporters that this achievement is mainly due to the further improvement of the technical equipment of coal mines in various regions this year. He said that more than 7,000 coal mining combines, coal cutting machines, and scraper conveyors have been added to coalfields across the country this year. The transportation of coal and rock has been 98.8% mechanized. Coal cutting, unloading, and other tasks are now completely done by machines. The comprehensive use of the "Donbass" coal mining combine, scraper conveyor, and new-style mobile supports alone has increased the labor productivity of the mining area by at least 25%.

Trukh said that there are now more than 60,000 various machines and mechanical devices in Soviet coal mining enterprises. They will mine approximately 430 million tons of coal this year, nearly 40 million tons more than last year.

    苏联欧洲部分统一输电系统第一部分
    古比雪夫—莫斯科高压输电线建成
    两个多月来的煤产量创苏联历史上最高纪录
    新华社22日讯　据塔斯社报道：苏联古比雪夫—莫斯科高压输电线已经全部建成。它的第二条电路在11月中旬建设完毕，并且已经向莫斯科开始供电。
    古比雪夫—莫斯科高压输电线是苏联第六个五年计划规定要建设的苏联欧洲部分统一输电系统的第一部分。它的第二条电路位于今年4月底建成的第一条电路的北边，并且和它平行。这两条电路共长一千八百六十公里，电压都是四十万伏特。支撑这条举世无匹的高压输电线的钢柱共有四千条，每条高二十七公尺，重十六吨。
    新华社21日讯　据塔斯社报道：苏联的煤矿企业在9月1日到11月7日的两个多月中为国家开采的煤，差不多比去年同期内的采煤量多一千万吨。这样高的生产纪录在苏联采煤工业史上还是第一次。
    采煤工业部副部长特鲁赫对塔斯社记者指出，这种成绩主要是由于今年各地煤矿的技术设备的进一步改善而得到的。他说，今年以来全国煤田已经增加了七千多台采煤联合机、截煤机和刮板运输机。煤和岩石的运输工作已经有98.8％机械化。截煤、卸煤等工作则完全由机器来做。单是综合采用了“顿巴斯”采煤联合机、刮板运输机和新式的活动支柱，就使采煤场的劳动生产率最少提高了25％。
    特鲁赫说，总计在苏联煤矿企业中现在共有六万多部各种机器和机械。它们今年将开采约四亿三千万吨煤，将近比去年多四千万吨。
