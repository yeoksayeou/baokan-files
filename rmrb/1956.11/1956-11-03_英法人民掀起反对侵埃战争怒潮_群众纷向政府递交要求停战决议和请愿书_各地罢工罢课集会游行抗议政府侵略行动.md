This reporter, Pan Fei, dispatches an urgent telegram from London on November 2nd: As one can see, the shameful and unjust war waged by Britain and France against Egypt is igniting the anger of the British people, and a nationwide protest movement is sweeping the country. Thousands of protest letters are pouring into Downing Street and the House of Commons, coming from factory worker groups, peace organizations, student groups, trade union branches, local Labour Party organizations, churches, and religious groups. Yesterday evening, the House of Commons received over three thousand protest telegrams. On the same evening, students in London held a demonstration, joined by tens of thousands of citizens. The procession started from Trafalgar Square and marched towards Parliament Square, chanting: "Eden get out! Down with the war!" The procession was attacked by mounted police, and some people were arrested. News of student demonstrations has also come from other cities such as Manchester, Birmingham, Oxford, and others.

Yesterday, as Eden walked out of his door to go to the House of Commons, the British people gathered in Downing Street booed him. Last night, at the Conservative Party meeting in Whitford, Foreign Secretary Lloyd was heckled off the stage. Lloyd's speech was frequently interrupted by shouts of "Let them go!" and "The most despicable government since Hitler!"

Xinhua News Agency, London, November 2nd: "Law, not war" is the slogan of the powerful peace movement now emerging in Britain, uniting broad sections of the British people who demand an immediate end to the war against Egypt.

The Labour Party National Executive Committee said in a statement issued on the 1st that it was "extremely shocked by the British government's action of using force against Egypt in clear violation of the United Nations Charter."

It called on the British government to: cease all military measures against Egypt, support the United Nations' call for an immediate ceasefire and the withdrawal of Israeli troops to the armistice line, recommend that the United Nations convene a peace conference to resolve the disputes between Israel and the Arab countries, and establish an effective system to guarantee peace and security in the Middle East.

The Labour Party National Executive Committee has passed a plan to launch a national movement to present the workers' movement's views on the "current serious international situation."

Xinhua News Agency, November 2nd: Paris Dispatch: The Anglo-French armed aggression against Egypt has ignited a wave of protest throughout France. Letters, telegrams, and petitions demanding an end to the aggression are flooding the French Prime Minister's office. Many delegations of Parisian working people and youth are constantly petitioning the National Assembly, presenting demands to the members of parliament from various parties to stop the aggression against Egypt.

Many factories have held short strikes, and workers in various places have held dozens of mass rallies to protest the Anglo-French aggression.

The French General Confederation of Labor issued a statement pointing out that the Anglo-French armed intervention threatens peace in the Near East and the world. The General Confederation of Labor calls on the French working people and trade union organizations to unite and fight against the threat of war, and calls for sending delegations to meet with government leaders and members of parliament, or writing letters, sending telegrams, and submitting petitions to them.

The Seine Provincial Peace Committee, the French Women's Union, the French Republican Youth Union, the Human Rights League, and other social organizations have also issued similar statements.

The National Committee of the French Republican Youth Union calls on young people participating in various political parties to firmly demand that the government stop armed intervention in Egypt.

It is reported that opposition to the aggressive actions of the French and British governments is rapidly growing throughout France. At the same time, this aggression has already caused divisions within many political parties.

Bujed, the head of the Bujed group in the French National Assembly, had already asked his partisans on October 29th to vote against the Mollet government's Middle East policy in the National Assembly. As a result, during the parliamentary vote, the 42 members of the Bujed faction split, with five supporting Mollet and twenty-eight abstaining.

The Popular Republican Party, which supports the government's policies, has also experienced disagreements. The French Civil Servants Federation, which it controls and has 350,000 members, issued a special statement on the evening of October 31st, reaffirming "its desire for peace."

Within the Socialist Party, to which French Prime Minister Mollet belongs, many people are also demanding an emergency meeting to condemn Mollet's actions.

It is reported that faced with a nationwide protest movement, French Prime Minister Mollet decided on November 1st to request that parliament pass a special bill granting him the power to deal with the emergency situation. According to people close to Mollet, this legislation would allow him to take military measures, usually reserved for a state of war, to stop possible "disturbances" within France.

    英法人民掀起反对侵埃战争怒潮
    群众纷向政府递交要求停战决议和请愿书
    各地罢工罢课集会游行抗议政府侵略行动
    本报记者潘非伦敦11月2日急电　人们可以看到，英、法对埃及所进行的可耻的、非正义的战争，正在激起了英国人民的愤怒，一个全国性的抗议运动正遍及全国。从工厂的工人团体、和平组织、学生团体、工会分会、工党的地方组织、教会和宗教团体发出的成千的抗议信，纷纷涌到唐宁街和下院。昨天夜晚，下院所收到的抗议电已达三千余封。在同一天的晚上，伦敦的学生举行了一次示威游行，成千上万的市民纷纷参加示威，游行队伍从特拉法加尔广场出发，向议会广场前进，沿途高呼：艾登滚蛋，打倒战争。游行队伍遭受到骑警的袭击，有的人被逮捕了。从其它城镇如曼彻斯特、伯明罕、牛津等等地方也传来了学生们举行示威游行的消息。
    昨天，当艾登走出门口赴下院的时候，聚集在唐宁街的英国人民发出了嘘声。昨天夜里，在惠特福特的保守党会议上，外交大臣劳埃德被赫克利尔哄下台去。劳埃德的发言，常常被“让他们滚吧”，和“继希特勒以来的最卑鄙的政府”的呼声所打断。
    据新华社伦敦2日电　“要法律——不要战争”是现在在英国出现的有力的和平运动的口号，它团结了要求立即结束对埃及的战争的英国广大阶层的人民。
    工党全国委员会在1日发表的声明中说，它对“英国政府明显地违反联合国宪章以武力对付埃及的行动感到极度震惊”。
    它要求英国政府：停止一切对埃及的军事措施，支持联合国提出的关于立即停火以及以色列军撤回停战线的要求，建议由联合国召开和平会议以解决以色列和阿拉伯国家间的纠纷，并且建立保证中东和平和安全的有效制度。
    工党全国委员会通过了一个计划，要求发起全国性的运动来提出工人运动对“目前的严重国际局势”的观点。
    据新华社2日讯　巴黎消息：英法对埃及的武装侵略激起了法国全国人民抗议的怒潮。要求停止侵略行动的信件、电报和请愿书像潮水一般涌向法国总理的办公室。巴黎劳动人民和青年的许多代表团不断前往国民议会请愿，向议会各党团议员提出停止侵略埃及的要求。
    许多工厂举行了短时间罢工，各处工人举行了几十次的群众集会，抗议英法的侵略。
    法国总工会发表声明，指出英法的武装干涉威胁着近东和世界和平。总工会号召法国劳动人民和工会组织团结起来为反对战争威胁而斗争，号召派代表团去见政府首脑和议员，或者写信、打电报和提出请愿书给他们。
    塞纳省和平委员会、法兰西妇女联盟、法兰西共和青年联盟、人权联盟和其他社会团体也发表了类似的声明。
    法兰西共和青年联盟全国委员会号召参加各政党的青年坚决要求政府停止对埃及的武装干涉。
    据悉，对法英两国政府侵略行动的反对情绪正在法国全国各地迅速增长。同时，这种侵略行动已经在许多政党的内部引起了分裂。
    法国国民议会布热德集团的首脑布热德10月29日曾经要求他的党羽在国民议会上投票反对摩勒政府的中东政策。结果在议会表决时，总共四十二人的布热德派议员发生分裂，五人支持摩勒，二十八人弃权。
    支持政府政策的人民共和党也发生分歧，它所控制的拥有三十五万会员的法国公务员联合会10月31日晚上特别发表声明，重申“它渴望和平”。
    在法国总理摩勒所属的社会党内部，也有许多人要求召开紧急会议来斥责摩勒的做法。
    据报道，面临着全国性的抗议运动，法国总理摩勒11月1日已经决定要求议会通过一项特别法案，授予应付紧急局势的权力。据接近摩勒的人士透露，这项立法将允许他采取通常为战争状态所保留的军事措施，来制止法国国内可能发生的“骚乱”。（附图片）
