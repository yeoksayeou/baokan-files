    The Truth About the "Good Guy"
    Recently, the United States has publicly expressed dissatisfaction with the Anglo-French invasion of Egypt, condemned Israel's aggression in the United Nations, and demanded the withdrawal of Anglo-French troops from Egypt, demonstrating a different attitude from Britain and France.

    What is the truth behind this "peacemaker" facade? U.S. Vice President Nixon answered this question. In a speech in Pennsylvania on November 2nd, he said that the United States severing ties with Britain and France on their policies in Asia and Africa is "a declaration of independence that has already had an astonishing impact on the world." According to a United Press International dispatch from New York on the 4th, U.S. officials bluntly stated that the alliance between the United States, Britain, and France will never be the same as before, and the United States will definitely develop a new colonial policy.

    To put it plainly, the United States wants to use this "peacemaker" facade to win over the hearts of the people in Asia and Africa in order to drive the British and French colonialists out of this region and expand its own colonial aggression. This is the truth about the United States pretending to be a good guy. (An)

### “好人”的真相

    “好人”的真相
    最近，美国对英法侵入埃及公开表示不满，在联合国中谴责以色列的侵略行为，并要求英法军队撤出埃及，表现了和英法不同的态度。
    在这副“和事老”面貌背后的真相是什么呢？美国副总统尼克松回答了这个问题。他11月2日在宾夕法尼亚州演说中说，美国同英法对亚非的政策断绝联系是“一个已经在全世界产生了惊人影响的独立宣言”。据合众社纽约4日的消息透露，美国官方人士更露骨地说，美、英、法的联盟决不会像以前一样了，美国一定会发展一种新的殖民主义政策。
    说得明白一些，就是美国想用这副“和事老”的面孔来笼络亚非地区的人心，以便把英、法殖民主义者从这个地区赶出去，好扩张自己的殖民侵略。这就是假装好人的美国的真相。（安）
