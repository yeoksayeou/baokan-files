Xinhua News Agency, New York, 28th - The United Nations General Assembly concluded its discussion on the British, French, and Israeli aggression against Egypt at the morning session on the 27th. Egyptian Foreign Minister Fawzi made the main speech at the meeting.

Fawzi first exposed the various atrocities committed by Britain and France in Egypt.

He had many photos of British and French atrocities in front of him. He refuted the claim by the aggressor states of Britain, France, and Israel that "only military targets were bombed," saying: "These photos show that many private residences and shacks in the middle of Port Said were completely destroyed. Are these military targets?

	"How can the massacred women and children be explained? Are they also military targets?"

Fawzi demanded a proper investigation and compensation for these atrocities, including the destruction of hospitals.

Fawzi once again pointed out that Britain and France had not implemented the UN General Assembly's resolution demanding their withdrawal, saying:

	"So far, none of the aggressor countries has submitted a reply to the General Assembly to clearly state that a withdrawal is underway or to propose any date for completing the withdrawal. Not only that, but we have also read news that French tanks are landing in Port Said, and the British are pretending to withdraw on the one hand, while on the other hand, they are sending troops to attack us...
	"The General Assembly has the right to know the truth about this activity in Port Said. The General Assembly has the responsibility and the right to ask the representatives of Israel, France, and the United Kingdom to state exactly when the withdrawal will be completed.
	"If satisfactory answers are not obtained, and satisfactory actions to comply with the resolution are not seen afterward, then the General Assembly must, with the assistance of the Security Council, consider taking measures to sanction aggression as stipulated in the United Nations Charter, including suspending membership in the United Nations and expulsion from the United Nations organization."

Fawzi spoke specifically about the status of the United Nations forces, saying: "The United Nations Emergency Force is not going to Egypt as an occupying force, not to replace the aggressors, not to clear the canal, nor to solve problems related to the Suez Canal, the Palestinian issue, or anything else. It is going to Egypt not to infringe on Egyptian sovereignty, but to embody the United Nations' determination to stop the aggression against Egypt. This must be made completely clear: this force is going to Egypt with Egypt's consent to help Egypt."

He said: "Regarding this issue (clearing the canal obstacles), there are two points to note. The first point is the form of the relationship between Egypt and the United Nations. The Egyptian government requested the United Nations to assist in clearing the canal. In a resolution adopted on November 24, the United Nations authorized the Secretary-General to study practical arrangements. From this, it can be inferred that the work of clearing the canal should be undertaken by the Egyptian government with the help of the United Nations.
	"The second point is the issue of responsibility related to damage and destruction. I don’t need to reiterate that the canal was operating very efficiently before this crazy attack occurred. ... More than 300 ships passed through the canal without difficulty."
	"If we don't want to completely ruin the dignity and effectiveness of the United Nations, these things must be done... When will this act of aggression stop? When will this insult to all mankind end? When will the invading troops withdraw? The world is waiting for an immediate response to these questions that we are authorized to raise."

Belarusian representative Kiselev also spoke at the meeting, stressing that the governments of Britain, France, and Israel bear full responsibility for all the consequences arising from the aggression against Egypt. He said, "We support this legitimate demand: Britain, France, and Israel should compensate Egypt for the losses suffered due to the destruction of Egyptian cities and settlements, as well as the disruption of shipping on the Suez Canal and the destruction of its structures."

Kiselev also believed that the huge expenses that the United Nations armed forces may need should be borne by the countries participating in the aggression against Egypt, namely Britain, France, and Israel.

Kiselev said that the United Nations should fully protect Egypt, the victim of aggression, in accordance with the Charter, so as not to betray the hopes placed in it by the people of all countries. It must also immediately resolve the current main problem—the problem of restoring peace and security in the Near East. This requires the immediate withdrawal of the armed forces of Britain, France, and Israel from Egypt.

Kiselev finally said that the United Nations cannot ignore the actions of Britain, France, and Israel in creating threats and tensions on the Israeli-Jordanian border and the Israeli-Syrian border. He said that it must be demanded that actions such as the concentration of troops near the Syrian border and the overflight of aircraft there be stopped immediately.

Near the end of the debate, Indian delegation leader Menon made a brief speech, reminding the General Assembly of the news report just mentioned by the Egyptian representative about French reinforcements arriving in Egypt. Menon asked the United Nations Secretary-General to request official information from the French government regarding this matter.

Subsequently, the United Nations General Assembly resumed the general debate that had been interrupted during the discussion of the aggression against Egypt.

### 埃及外长在联合国大会上主张  英法以如继续拖延撤军应予制裁  重申联合国部队不得侵犯埃及主权

    埃及外长在联合国大会上主张
    英法以如继续拖延撤军应予制裁
    重申联合国部队不得侵犯埃及主权
    据新华社28日讯　纽约消息：联合国大会在27日的上午会议上结束了关于英法和以色列侵略埃及问题的讨论。埃及外交部长法齐在会上作了主要的发言。
    法齐首先揭露了英法在埃及的各种暴行。
    他面前摆了许多关于英法暴行的照片。他驳斥英、法、以色列侵略国家的关于“所轰击的只是一些军事目标”的说法，他说：“这些照片表明，就在塞得港中部的许多私人住宅和茅屋完全被毁了。难道这些是军事目标吗？
      “对于被屠杀的妇女和儿童又怎样解释呢？难道他们也是军事目标？”
    法齐要求对于这些包括毁坏医院在内的暴行进行适当的调查和赔偿。
    法齐再一次指出英法还没有执行联大的关于要求它们撤兵的决议，他说：
        “到目前为止，侵略国中间的任何一国都还没有向大会提出答复来明确地说明已经在进行撤退或者提出完成撤退工作的任何日期。不但如此，我们还读到消息说，法国坦克正在塞得港登陆，英国人也一方面假装进行撤退，另一方面却出动军队进攻我们……
      “大会有权要求了解在塞得港所进行的这种活动的真实情况。大会有责任也有权利要求以色列、法国和联合王国的代表说明究竟到什么时候才能完成撤退工作。
      “如果得不到满意的答复，而且随后也看不到满意的遵行决议的行动，那末大会就必须在安全理事会的协助下考虑采取联合国宪章中所规定的制裁侵略的措施，包括停止联合国会员国资格和开除出联合国组织的措施。”
    法齐特别谈到了联合国部队的地位问题，他说：“联合国紧急部队不是作为占领军到埃及去的，不是去代替侵略者，不是去清理运河，也不是去解决与苏伊士运河、巴勒斯坦问题或与任何其他事情有关的问题的。它到埃及去不是要侵犯埃及的主权，而是体现联合国制止对埃及的侵略的决心。这一点必须完全弄明确：这支部队是得到埃及的同意去帮助埃及的”。
    他说：“关于这个（清理运河障碍）问题，有两点需要注意。第一点是埃及和联合国之间关系的形式。埃及政府要求联合国协助清理运河。联合国在11月24日通过的决议中授权秘书长研讨实际可行的安排。由此可以推断，应该由埃及政府在联合国的帮助下担任清理运河的工作。
    “第二点是与损坏和破坏有关的责任问题。我用不着追述发生这个疯狂进攻以前运河工作进行得十分有效的情况。……三百多只船毫无困难地通过了运河。”
    “如果不想使联合国的尊严和效能一败涂地，就必须做到这些事情……这种侵略行为到几时才能停止？这种对全人类的侮辱几时才能完结？侵略军队几时才能撤退？全世界正在等待着对我们授权提出的这些问题给予立即答复。”
    白俄罗斯代表基谢廖夫也在会上发了言，他着重指出，英国、法国和以色列三国政府对由于侵略埃及的行动而产生的一切后果负有完全责任。他说，“我们支持这种正当的要求：英国、法国和以色列应当赔偿埃及由于埃及的城市和居民点遭到破坏以及由于苏伊士运河的航运中断和它的建筑物被破坏而蒙受的损失。”
    基谢廖夫还认为，联合国武装部队可能需要的庞大开支，应当由参加侵略埃及的国家负担，也就是由英国、法国和以色列三国负担。
    基谢廖夫说，联合国应当完全根据宪章来保护侵略的牺牲者埃及，这样才会不辜负各国人民对它所寄托的希望。它还必须立即解决当前的主要问题——关于恢复近东地区的和平和安全的问题。这就要求英国、法国和以色列的武装部队立即撤出埃及。
    基谢廖夫最后说，联合国还不能忽略英国、法国和以色列在以色列—约旦边境和以色列—叙利亚边境造成威胁和紧张局势的行动。他说，必须要求立即停止军队在叙利亚边境附近集中和飞机飞过那里这样一类行动。
    在辩论快结束的时候，印度代表团团长梅农作了简短的发言，他提醒大会注意埃及代表刚说过的关于法国增援部队开到埃及的这个报刊消息，梅农请联合国秘书长要求法国政府提出关于这方面的官方情报。
    随后，联合国大会恢复了在讨论侵略埃及问题期间中断了的一般性讨论。
