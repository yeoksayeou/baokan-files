Xinhua News Agency, November 1st dispatch from Cairo: Cairo Radio broadcast an official communique today stating that Egypt has decided to sever all relations with Britain and France.

The communique also stated that when the United Nations faced the ambitions of imperialist powers, it suffered an obvious failure and proved to be useless. Under these circumstances, the Egyptian government is studying the possibility of withdrawing from the United Nations.

Xinhua News Agency, November 1st dispatch from New York: A spokesman for the Egyptian delegation to the United Nations issued a statement accusing Israel of "colluding in aggression" with Britain and France and said that Egypt would resist aggression to the end.

The Egyptian delegation’s statement, released before the Security Council meeting, stated: "The whole world can bear witness for us that this unprovoked aggression by Britain and France in attacking Egypt and bombing innocent Egyptian civilians violates the Anglo-Egyptian Agreement of 1954, the Constantinople Convention of 1888, and the Charter of the United Nations."

The statement pointed out, "This act of aggression treats all international moral principles as child's play and is a revival of nineteenth-century colonialism. These aggressors do not seem to have realized that this colonialism is not only outdated and doomed to failure, but will also be condemned by the world's civilized opinion."

The statement said, "The Egyptian delegation expresses the wishes of the entire Egyptian people and now declares that Egypt will resist aggression to the last drop of blood."

Husseini, the press officer of the Egyptian delegation, in another statement, condemned the British and French use of the veto in the Security Council as a blow to the United Nations, and they should be responsible for the far-reaching consequences that may arise.

    埃及决定同英法断绝一切关系
    埃及驻联合国代表团声明坚决抗战到底
    新华社1日讯　开罗消息：开罗电台今天广播一则官方公报说，埃及已经决定同英国和法国断绝一切关系。
    公报还说，当联合国面对帝国主义大国的野心的时候，它遭到显然的失败而且表现得无用，在这种情况下，埃及政府正在研究它退出联合国的可能性。
    新华社1日讯　纽约消息：埃及驻联合国代表团发言人发表声明，指责以色列同英国和法国“同谋发动侵略”，并且说，埃及将抵抗侵略到底。
    埃及代表团在安理会开会前发表的声明说：“全世界都可以给我们做证人，英国和法国进攻埃及和轰炸无辜的埃及平民这种无端的侵略是违背1954年的英埃协定，1888年的君士坦丁堡公约，和联合国宪章的。”
    声明指出，“这种侵略行动把所有国际道义原则视同儿戏，并且是十九世纪殖民主义的复活。这些侵略者们看来还没有认识到，这种殖民主义不但已经过时和注定要失败，并且还会遭到世界文明舆论的谴责。”
    声明说，“埃及代表团表达全体埃及人民的愿望，现在声明，埃及将抵抗侵略到最后一滴血。”
    埃及代表团的新闻发布官侯赛尼在另外一个声明中谴责英国和法国在安全理事会使用否决权的做法是对联合国的一个打击，它们应当对可能引起的深远后果负责。
