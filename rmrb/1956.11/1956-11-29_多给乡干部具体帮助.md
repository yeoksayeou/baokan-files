    Give More Specific Help to Township Cadres
    Qi Min
    In rural areas, the Party and government organizations at the township level are the grassroots organizations through which the Party and the government connect with the masses of peasants and implement various policies. No rural work can be done well without the Party and government organizations at the township level. The quality of work of township cadres and whether their style is democratic or undemocratic are closely related to the quality of work of our Party and government. Therefore, regularly and specifically helping township cadres, constantly improving their working abilities, and patiently teaching them the working methods of the mass line are important responsibilities of leaders at all levels (especially county-level leaders).
      At present, grassroots cadres are indeed very hardworking. They are busy all day long, sometimes unable to eat during the day and unable to sleep until late at night. They are either attending meetings in the county or filling out forms in the township, being called here and shouted there, and following the leaders around all day. But in the end, they inevitably fall into the trap of hard-working bureaucracy or commandism. Here, I am not saying that township cadres should not be criticized for bureaucracy or commandism, but rather, what are the reasons for their bureaucracy or commandism? What specific assistance has the leading body given them to overcome their bureaucracy and commandism? Upon careful examination, the bureaucracy and commandism of grassroots cadres are mostly inseparable from the leadership style and working style of the higher leading bodies. Higher leading bodies often just sit in their offices issuing instructions, assigning tasks, and urging tasks, and frequently summon township cadres to the county for meetings. Apart from this, they rarely help them to think of solutions or offer ideas in actual work. County-level departments, regardless of the size of the matter, like to sit in their offices and assign tasks and demand materials from below. In this way, numerous tasks are issued, and all must be completed within a limited time. But while there are thousands of threads from above, there is only one needle below. All tasks must be done by the township cadres themselves, so how can the work not be busy, chaotic, and passive? To say nothing else, judging from the meetings currently held in some counties, township cadres really cannot cope. The following is an excerpt from the work diary of the Party Branch Secretary of Dongfa Township, Zhaodong County, Heilongjiang Province:
  "September 18th to 25th, attended the meeting on increasing production and guaranteeing harvest and disaster relief in the county; September 29th to October 2nd, attended the meeting in the county to discuss the abolition of district establishment; October 7th, convened a township general branch committee meeting to convey the spirit of the county meeting; today is October 13th, and I am called to the county for another meeting, I don't know when I can return to the township to work." In early October, the Party Branch Secretary of Shenjiaping Township, Pingshun County, Shanxi Province, had just returned from a meeting in the county and had not yet put down his luggage when the county people's committee called him to immediately attend another meeting in the county. Recently, in Yuyao County, Zhejiang, as many as seven township cadres from one township went to the county to attend various meetings at the same time, and the work in the township had to be temporarily entrusted to the director of an agricultural cooperative.
    Where is the key to changing the leadership style of county-level leading bodies? The key lies in whether the leading cadres of the county are determined to streamline meetings, reduce forms and reports, and frequently send a large number of cadres to the townships to specifically help township cadres with their work. Many facts have proved that the county whose leading cadres and county-level staff go deep into the grassroots and strengthen specific guidance for township cadres is the county where the working ability of township cadres is improved relatively quickly. Wanquan County, Hebei Province, is a good example. Before 1955, the working ability of township cadres in Wanquan County was generally low. Among the county's more than 50 townships, only 12 were able to work independently and regularly complete tasks; among more than 100 branch secretaries and township heads, more than half were illiterate before 1955 and lacked the ability to work independently. Since December last year, the county has mobilized the strength of county-level departments to help improve the working ability of township cadres. In addition to successively transferring some cadres to strengthen the leadership of the townships, the county also established a system of regularly sending county-level cadres to the townships and having responsible cadres directly establish regular contact with the agricultural cooperatives. Each of the county's 66 section chiefs and bureau chiefs regularly contacted one agricultural cooperative and regularly reported to the county party committee the problems and experiences found in the contact. The important task of the cadres sent to the townships was to cultivate and improve the working ability of grassroots cadres, and this was used as a criterion for assessing whether the work of the cadres sent to the townships was done well. In the past year, members of the county party committee generally spent two-thirds of their working time in the townships. In order to set an example, the county party secretary took the lead in personally checking the work of the cadres sent to the townships, and giving specific help or criticism to comrades whose work was not deep enough at any time. In this way, comrades working in the townships could generally teach township cadres how to carry out their work through specific problems. Comrades working in the townships often went deep into the fields with township cadres to discover problems, and then inspired township cadres to find the reasons and help them study solutions. Some meetings that had to be held were often held in separate areas or moved to the townships by county-level departments. This could reduce the round-trip distance for township cadres attending the meetings, and it was also convenient to connect with reality, so that the county's resolutions and plans were more in line with the actual situation, and the problems in the work could be effectively solved. With such cultivation and assistance, the working ability of township cadres in Wanquan County has generally improved significantly. At present, most of the more than 50 township general branch secretaries can work independently.
    Regularly sending cadres to the townships to help township cadres with their work is a good way to improve the working ability of grassroots cadres. But in order to achieve the desired effect, the cadres sent to the townships should also pay special attention to their own working style. At present, some cadres sent to the townships do not patiently help township cadres with weaker working abilities, but often criticize and accuse them loudly when they see a small problem in their work, saying that township cadres are doing this wrong and that wrong, and even some take over the work of township cadres, not consulting with them when things happen, often directly directing them to do things, or only letting township cadres run errands and count some numbers, instead of closely relying on them and working through them. As a result, township cadres are confused and do not know how to do things well. Therefore, some township cadres said: "We are only criticized, and we can't even learn a little bit of work methods." Qiu Xiang, Party Branch Secretary of Yongfeng Township, Fangzheng County, Heilongjiang Province, was very distressed because he had few working methods and could not get the patient help of the resident cadres. He had resigned from the county party committee several times, requesting to return home to produce. The work team sent by Anguo County, Hebei Province, to Xifuluo Township to help township cadres rectify the financial system of agricultural cooperatives put aside the Party's township general branch secretary and directly convened and presided over Party meetings. The methods and steps for rectifying the financial system were not first discussed and formulated by the general branch committee, but the work team forced the general branch committee to pass and implement a set of plans that had been prepared in advance. As a result, the work was not only not done well, but also aroused the dissatisfaction of township and cooperative cadres with the work team. These purely accusatory and paternalistic working styles are of no benefit to improving the independent working ability of township cadres and doing rural work well, and should be given serious attention by the cadres sent to the townships.

    多给乡干部具体帮助
    启民
    在农村中，乡一级的党、政组织，是党和政府联系农民群众、贯彻执行各项政策的基层组织。一切农村工作不通过乡一级的党、政组织就不可能办好。乡干部的工作的好坏，作风的民主或不民主，都与我们党和政府工作的好坏密切相关。因此，经常地具体帮助乡干部，不断提高他们的工作能力，耐心教给他们群众路线的工作方法，是各级领导人员（特别是县的领导人员）的重要责任。
      目前，基层干部的确是很辛苦的。他们天天忙忙碌碌，有时白天忙的吃不上饭，晚上忙到深更半夜还睡不了觉，不是上县开会，就是在乡填表，这里叫，那里喊，整天跟在领导后面转。但是忙到末了，还不免落一个辛辛苦苦的官僚主义或者命令主义。这里我不是说乡干部有了官僚主义或者命令主义不该批评，而是说乡干部的官僚主义或命令主义到底是由什么原因造成的呢？为了克服他们的官僚主义和命令主义，领导机关究竟给了他们一些什么帮助呢？仔细研究起来，基层干部的官僚主义和命令主义大多是同上级领导机关的领导作风和工作作风分不开的。上级领导机关，往往只是坐在办公室里发指示布置任务和催任务，动不动就把乡干部召集到县上来开会，除此之外，却很少在实际工作中具体帮助他们想办法、出主意。县级各业务部门事无大小总喜欢坐在机关里向下布置任务和催要材料。这样条条任务下达，而且都要限期完成。但是上面虽有千条线，下面却只有一根针，一切任务都得乡干部亲自动手，工作怎能不忙乱被动呢？别的不说，单从目前有些县所召开的会议来看，乡干部就确实应付不了。下面是黑龙江省肇东县东发乡党总支书记的一段工作日记：
  “9月18日到25日，在县里参加增产保收和救灾会议；9月29日到10月2日在县里参加讨论撤销区建制的会议；10月7日在乡召开乡总支委员会议，传达县的会议精神；今天是10月13日，又叫到县上去开会，不知何日才能回乡工作。”山西省平顺县申家坪乡党总支书记10月上旬从县里开会刚回来，还没有放下行李，县人民委员会就打电话要他马上到县里参加另外的会议。浙江余姚县最近有一个乡竟有七个乡干部同时到县里去参加各种会议，而乡上的工作只好暂时委托一个农业社主任来代理。
    县级领导机关改变领导作风的关键问题在哪里呢？关键就在于县的领导干部有没有决心来精简会议、减少表报而经常抽出大批干部，下派到乡里去，具体帮助乡干部进行工作。许多事实证明，那个县的领导干部和县级机关的工作人员深入了基层，加强了对乡干部的具体领导，那个县的乡干部工作能力提高得就比较快。河北省万全县就是一个很好的例子。万全县在1955年以前，一般乡干部的工作能力都很低。在全县五十多个乡中，能够独立进行工作并能经常完成任务的乡只有十二个；一百多名支部书记和乡长中，在1955年以前，有一半以上都是文盲，缺乏独立工作的能力。该县从去年12月开始，就动员县级机关力量，帮助提高乡干部的工作能力。县里除先后调出部分干部充实了乡的领导以外，并建立了经常派出县级机关干部下乡和负责干部直接同各农业社建立经常联系的制度。全县六十六名科长和股长以上干部，每人都和一个农业社进行经常联系，定期向县委汇报在联系中发现的问题和取得的经验。派到乡上去的干部的重要任务是培养和提高基层干部的工作能力，并以此作为考核下乡干部工作做得好坏的一项标准。县委委员们近一年来一般都有二分之一的工作时间在乡上工作。为了作出榜样，县委书记带头亲自检查下乡干部的工作，对工作不够深入的同志随时给予具体的帮助或批评。这样下乡工作的同志一般都能通过具体问题教给乡干部如何进行工作。下乡工作的同志经常和乡干部一起深入到田间地头，发现问题，就启发乡干部寻找原因帮助他们研究解决的办法。有些必需召开的会议，县级机关常常分片召开或者搬到乡下去开。这样可以减少参加会议的乡干部的往返路程，也便于联系实际，使县上的决议和计划更符合实际情况，使工作中的问题能够得到切实的解决。有了这样的培养和帮助，万全县乡干部的工作能力一般都有显著的提高，目前五十多个乡总支书记绝大部分都能独立地进行工作。
    经常派干部到乡上帮助乡干部进行工作，这是提高基层干部工作能力的好办法。但是要获得预期的效果，下乡干部还要特别注意自己的工作作风。目前有些下乡干部，对于工作能力较弱的乡干部不是耐心地进行帮助，而往往看到他们工作中有一点小毛病，就大喊大叫的进行批评和指责，说乡干部这个做的不对，那个做的也不行，甚至有的竟包办代替了乡干部的工作，遇事不同他们商量，往往自己直接指挥着去干，或者只让乡干部跑跑腿，统计一些数目字，而不是紧紧地依靠他们和通过他们去进行工作。结果使乡干部东一头西一头的乱撞，不知道究竟怎样做才好。因此有些乡干部说：“光挨批评，连点工作办法也学不到”。中共黑龙江省方正县永丰乡党总支书记丘祥由于自己工作办法少，又得不到驻乡干部的耐心帮助，非常苦恼，曾几次向县委辞职，要求回家生产。河北安国县派工作组到西佛落乡帮助乡干部整顿农业社的财务制度，他们在进行工作时把党的乡总支书记撂在一边，由工作组直接去召开和主持党的会议。整顿财务制度的方法和步骤，不是先由总支委员会讨论制定，而是工作组把事先制定好的一套计划硬让总支委员会通过执行。结果工作不但没有做好，反而引起了乡社干部对工作组的不满。这些单纯指责和包办代替的工作作风，对提高乡干部独立工作能力和做好农村工作是没有任何好处的，应当引起下乡干部的严重注意。
