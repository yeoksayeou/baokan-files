Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 26th: Shanxi Province is preparing to comprehensively rectify more than 19,000 agricultural production cooperatives from now until March of next year. This rectification work will be combined with the work of rectifying the rural grassroots organizations of the Party.

At an organizational work conference held some time ago, the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China already conducted a detailed study of the rectification of cooperatives and the Party. Various localities are successively concentrating on training leading cadres and conducting key experiments. Changzhi Prefecture, which has made faster progress, has already begun rectification in more than 400 agricultural cooperatives.

This year, advanced agricultural cooperatives in Shanxi Province have generally increased production, and their organization is basically consolidated. However, at present, the production level of agricultural cooperatives throughout the province is still relatively low, and the degree of organizational consolidation is not balanced. There are still many problems in the relationship between the collective and the individual, and between the collective and the state that have not been correctly resolved. Subjectivism and commandism of leading cadres are still relatively common, and there is some blindness in production management. At the same time, although the ideological level and leadership ability of the rural grassroots organizations of the Party have been greatly improved, they still cannot fully adapt to the requirements of the new situation in rural cooperativization. This rectification is aimed at the above-mentioned situations and problems, and will carry out ideological education in accordance with the spirit of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, so that the broad masses of Party members and cadres can clearly understand the future development direction and tasks of rural areas, the important relationship between the leadership work of agricultural cooperatives and the people's lives, and the harm of commandism. Then, on the basis of improving the ideological awareness of cadres, fully mobilize the masses to rectify the rural grassroots organizations of the Party, improve the Party's methods of activity, and overcome the two deviations of the Party's grassroots organizations of either letting agricultural cooperatives go unattended or taking care of everything. When rectifying agricultural cooperatives, we will start with inspecting and summarizing work, study the actual experiences and lessons learned over the past year, and in light of the specific situation of each cooperative and the needs of future production development, focus on doing a good job in the planned management of collective production of agricultural cooperatives, implement the principles of diligence and thrift in running cooperatives and democratic management of cooperatives, further strengthen organizational construction, re-elect the leading cadres of agricultural cooperatives, and correctly handle the specific problems existing between individuals and the collective.

    山西省开始整顿农业生产合作社
    从检查总结工作入手　和整党工作结合进行
    新华社太原26日电　山西省准备从现在开始到明年3月全面整顿一万九千多个农业生产合作社。这次整社工作将和整顿农村党的基层组织的工作结合起来进行。
    中共山西省委员会在前些时候召开的组织工作会议上，已经对整社整党工作作了详细研究。各地正在陆续集中训练领导骨干，进行重点试验。进展较快的长治专区已经在四百多个农业社中开始整顿。
    今年山西省高级社普遍增产，组织上也基本巩固。但是，目前全省农业社的生产水平还是比较低，组织巩固程度也不平衡，集体和个人、集体和国家之间的关系中还有许多问题没有得到正确解决，领导干部主观主义和命令主义作风还比较普遍，生产管理上存在着一些盲目性。同时，农村党的基层组织的思想水平和领导能力虽然已经有很大提高，但是还不能完全适应当前农村合作化后新形势的要求。这次整顿就是针对着上述情况和问题，根据中共第八次全国代表大会的精神进行思想教育，使广大党员干部明确认识今后农村的发展方向和任务、农业社领导工作对人民生活的重大关系、命令主义作风的危害性。然后，在干部思想觉悟提高的基础上，充分发动群众，整顿党的农村基层组织，改进党的活动方法，克服党的基层组织对农业社放任不管或事事包办两种偏向。在整顿农业社的时候，将从检查总结工作入手，研究一年来取得的实际经验教训，结合各个社的具体情况和今后发展生产的需要，着重做好农业社集体生产的计划管理，贯彻执行勤俭办社和民主办社的原则，进一步加强组织建设，改选农业社的领导干部，并且正确地处理个人和集体等方面存在的具体问题。
