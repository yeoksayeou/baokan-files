Xinhua News Agency, 29th: The National General Assembly of Trade Union Grassroots Cadres in Joint Public-Private Enterprises concluded today.

Lai Ruoyu, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, delivered a summation. He put forward relatively specific opinions on the issues of democratic management, trade union supervision, and employee benefits in joint ventures discussed at this conference. However, he stated that these opinions were for reference only. Current practices can and should be diverse, and uniformity should not be forced.

Lai Ruoyu said that the Enterprise Management Committee should be an organization for workers and trade unions to participate in enterprise management. This is not exactly the same as workers directly managing production in private enterprises in the past. It has a parallel relationship with the public representatives and should cooperate with the public representatives to jointly manage the enterprise. The Enterprise Management Committee has the right to inspect all aspects of the enterprise's work and make suggestions; it has the right to request administrative leaders to report on the work situation; it has the right to discuss major issues in the enterprise and make resolutions without violating the orders and instructions of higher authorities. If its resolutions are inconsistent with the opinions of administrative leaders, it can report to the higher leading organs for a decision. It should also have the right to make recommendations on the appointment and removal of cadres within the enterprise. Lai Ruoyu said that the democratic management of enterprises must be combined with the country's centralized management and unified leadership to ensure the smooth implementation of the national plan.

Lai Ruoyu also put forward some specific opinions on the establishment, composition of personnel of the Management Committee, and its relationship with the Party committee and the trade union. He said that these opinions were immature, and he hoped that all localities would try them out based on local conditions and gain experience through exploration. This experience will also help solve the problem of implementing management democratization in state-owned enterprises.

Regarding the issue of trade union supervision, Lai Ruoyu believes that the issue of trade union supervision can be resolved more thoroughly by implementing democratic enterprise management. He pointed out that the trade union supervision of joint ventures is fundamentally different in nature from the supervision of capitalists by private enterprises in the past. The relationship between workers, trade unions, and public representatives in joint ventures is a cooperative relationship between comrades. Both parties must support and help each other. The trade union should understand the situation of the public representatives and realize supervision through criticism and self-criticism.

Lai Ruoyu said that, according to the proposal of Vice Premier Chen Yun, it is necessary to launch a publicity and explanation campaign on the policy of redemption in national joint ventures. He asked trade union organizations in various localities to do a good job in publicity and education through report meetings, seminars, and other methods.

The conference lasted for seven days. In addition to listening to the reports of Vice Premier of the State Council Chen Yun, Director of the Fourth Office of the State Council Jia Tuofu, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions Lai Ruoyu, and Minister of Wages Wang Rong, sixteen representatives reported on their work experience in democratic management of joint ventures, improving the lives and welfare of employees, and giving full play to the role of trade union organizations.

    在公私合营企业工会基层干部大会上赖若愚作总结
    说明企业管理委员会的性质和权限
    指出企业的民主管理必须和国家的集中管理和统一领导相结合
    新华社29日讯　全国公私合营企业工会基层干部大会今天闭幕。
    中华全国总工会主席赖若愚作了总结。他就这次大会讨论的合营企业的民主管理、工会监督和职工福利等问题，提出了比较具体的意见。不过对于这些意见，他声明是供各地参考的。现在的做法可以是而且应当是多样的，不能强求一致。
    赖若愚说，企业管理委员会应当是职工群众和工会参加企业管理的机构，这和过去私营企业中工人直接管理生产是不完全相同的，它和公方代表是平行关系，它应该同公方代表合作，共同管理企业。企业管理委员会有权检查企业各方面的工作，提出意见；有权要求行政负责人报告工作情况；有权讨论企业中的重大问题，并且在不违背上级命令、指示的情况下作出决议，如果它的决议同行政领导的意见不一致时，可以报请上级领导机关决定。它还应该有权对企业内干部的任免提出意见。赖若愚说，企业的民主管理必须和国家的集中管理和统一领导相结合，才能保证国家计划的顺利执行。
    赖若愚还对管理委员会的产生、人员组成以及它同党委、工会的关系等方面，提出了一些具体意见。他说，这些意见都是不成熟的，希望各地根据当地情况试办，从摸索中取得经验，这些经验，也将有助于解决国营企业实行管理民主化的问题。
    关于工会监督问题，赖若愚认为实行企业管理民主化，工会的监督问题也就能比较彻底地解决了。他指出，现在合营企业的工会监督同过去私营企业对资本家的监督在性质上有根本的区别。合营企业中工人、工会同公方代表之间的关系是同志合作关系，双方必须互相支持，互相帮助，工会要体谅公方代表的处境，通过批评和自我批评的方式实现监督。
    赖若愚说，根据陈云副总理的提议，有必要在全国合营企业中展开一次关于赎买政策的宣传解释工作，他要求各地工会组织通过报告会、座谈会及其他方式做好宣传教育工作。
    这次大会共举行了七天，大会除听了国务院副总理陈云、国务院第四办公室主任贾拓夫、中华全国总工会主席赖若愚和工资部部长王榕的报告外，还有十六个代表报告了关于合营企业的民主管理、改善职工的生活福利和发挥工会组织的作用等方面的工作经验。
