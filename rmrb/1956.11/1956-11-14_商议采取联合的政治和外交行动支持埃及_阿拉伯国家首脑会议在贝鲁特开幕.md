Xinhua News Agency, Beirut, 13th: The Arab Heads of State Conference, convened after the Anglo-French aggression against Egypt, held its first meeting this morning in the Lebanese capital, Beirut.

    The issues on the conference agenda include: discussing joint political and diplomatic actions to support Egypt, as well as the Palestine issue (including the refugee problem), etc.

    This conference was arranged based on the proposal of Lebanese President Camille Chamoun. The conference will last for two days.

    Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 13th: The Chairman of the Arab League, Fayez Sayegh, said on a national television program in Washington on the 11th: "The Arab countries, as countries that have fought an expensive struggle and paid an expensive price for their freedom, will not welcome any foreign troops (into Egypt)," but if the troops of Britain, France, and Israel do not withdraw from Egypt, "the Arab countries will welcome any assistance they can get… We are determined not to let our sovereignty be violated."

    Sayegh said that if the three aggressors, Britain, France, and Israel, refuse to comply with the orders on ceasefire and withdrawal of troops given to them by the overwhelming majority in the United Nations General Assembly and reiterated three times, then these countries must bear "all the consequences" of this non-compliance with the Assembly's orders.

    Sayegh ridiculed the news from London about the Soviet Union having shipped nearly $500 million worth of arms to the Middle East. He pointed out that these messages were coming from British officials, simply to "justify the British government's conspiracy and aggression against Egypt."

    商议采取联合的政治和外交行动支持埃及
    阿拉伯国家首脑会议在贝鲁特开幕
    新华社13日讯　贝鲁特消息：在英法侵略埃及以后召集的阿拉伯国家首脑会议今天上午在黎巴嫩首都贝鲁特举行了第一次会议。
    在会议议程上的问题有：讨论采取联合的政治和外交行动来支持埃及以及巴勒斯坦问题（包括难民问题）等。
    这次会议是根据黎巴嫩总统夏蒙的建议而安排的。会议将举行两天。
    新华社13日讯　华盛顿消息：阿拉伯国家联盟主席萨耶格11日在华盛顿的全国电视节目中说：“阿拉伯国家，作为曾经为了自己的自由而进行过昂贵的斗争并且付出过昂贵的代价的国家，是不会欢迎任何外国军队（进入埃及）的”，但是，如果英、法和以色列的军队不撤出埃及，“阿拉伯国家将欢迎它们可以获得的任何援助……我们决心不让我们的主权受到侵犯”。
    萨耶格说，如果英、法和以色列这三个侵略者拒绝遵守由联合国大会中极大多数所给予它们的并且三次重申的关于停火和撤军的命令，那么这些国家必将承担这种不遵守大会命令的行为的“一切后果”。
    萨耶格嘲笑从伦敦传出的关于苏联已经把差不多五亿美元军火运到中东的消息。他指出，这些消息是从英国官方人士那里传出的，无非是“为英国政府的阴谋和对埃及的侵略辩护”。
