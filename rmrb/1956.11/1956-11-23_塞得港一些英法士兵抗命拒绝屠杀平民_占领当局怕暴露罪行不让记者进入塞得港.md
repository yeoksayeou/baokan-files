Xinhua News Agency, November 22nd: According to TASS, Cairo, November 21st: Newspapers published a report from Tel Aviv stating that unrest had occurred among British and French soldiers in Port Said, who refused to carry out the headquarters' orders to "shoot and kill" civilians.

The report stated that specially formed military tribunals tried forty British and French army and navy soldiers accused of disobedience and sentenced two French sailors and one British army soldier to death for "inciting unrest." The remaining thirty-seven were sentenced to varying terms of imprisonment.

Xinhua News Agency, November 22nd: According to TASS, Cairo, November 21st: The Middle East News Agency reported that the command of the British and French armed forces refused to allow one hundred and fifty foreign and Egyptian journalists to enter Port Said with the first batch of the United Nations Emergency Force, which set off from Abu Suweir for Port Said this morning.

This fact once again demonstrates that the British and French aggressors are attempting to prevent the world public from knowing about the destruction and atrocities they have committed in Port Said.

    塞得港一些英法士兵抗命拒绝屠杀平民
    占领当局怕暴露罪行不让记者进入塞得港
    新华社22日讯　据塔斯社开罗21日讯：报纸刊载特拉维夫的消息说，塞得港的英法士兵中间发生了骚动，拒绝执行司令部关于“枪杀和打死”平民的命令。
    消息说，特别成立的军事法庭审讯了四十名被控不服从命令的英法陆军和海军士兵，并且以“煽动骚动罪”把两名法国水兵和一名英国陆军士兵判处死刑。其余三十七人被判处期限不等的徒刑。
    据新华社22日讯　据塔斯社开罗21日讯：中东通讯社报道，英法武装部队指挥部拒绝了一百五十名外国和埃及报刊记者随首批联合国紧急部队进入塞得港，联合国的这支部队是今天早上从阿布苏威尔启程开赴塞得港的。
    这一事实再一次说明，英法侵略者企图不让世界公众知道他们在塞得港所作的破坏和暴行。
