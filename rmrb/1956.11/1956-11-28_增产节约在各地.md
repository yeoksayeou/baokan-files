Increase Production and Practice Economy in Various Places

Use Economy to Guarantee Increased Production

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang – Seven factories including the Shenyang Second Machine Tool Plant, Shenyang Pneumatic Tool Plant, and Shenyang Bicycle Factory have solved the difficulty of steel shortage through conservation. This not only ensures that production will not be reduced this year, but also allows for an increase of 100 drilling machines, 1,400 rock drills, and 27,000 bicycles.  Workers in fourteen machinery and electrical factories, including the Shenyang Heavy Machinery Plant, have saved more than 4,600 tons of steel in eight months, playing a significant role in ensuring production.

In the steel conservation campaign, the workers of various machinery factories in Shenyang, in addition to recycling a large amount of scrap steel, also saved steel by improving product design, process specifications, and strengthening material management. The Pneumatic Tool Plant and the Second Machine Tool Plant also used the saved material heads to manufacture a large number of products. Workers at the First Machine Tool Plant used large nesting knives to process the main shaft of the 1A62 lathe, saving 32 tons of high-quality carbon steel in four months. After the designers of the Transformer Factory improved the design of three types of transformers, an average of 7.5 tons of silicon steel sheet could be saved per transformer.

Learn New Technology, Produce More Steel

Xinhua News Agency, Fushun – The steel casting workshop of the Fushun Heavy Machinery Plant has learned from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and changed the furnace wall of the steelmaking furnace to a large block of magnesite furnace wall, which can produce more than 1,000 tons of steel per year.

The steelmaking furnace wall in this workshop used to be made of iron pipes filled with bittern-magnesite mixture. It had to be repaired every seven or eight days on average. Workers had to work in high temperatures during the repair, and each repair took more than a day. Therefore, production tasks often could not be completed, causing the metalworking workshop of steel castings to constantly experience shutdowns and waiting for materials, resulting in an imbalance in the plant's production.

After changing to a large block of magnesite furnace wall, the life of the furnace wall was greatly extended, and the cast steel parts produced were supplied to the metalworking workshop in a timely manner. More than 100 tons of iron pipes and magnesite can also be saved each year. Repair workers no longer have to work in high temperatures.

Improve Product Design

Xinhua News Agency – The Beijing Second Machine Tool Plant has saved 19 tons and 400 kilograms of steel since September by improving product design and other aspects.

In order to save steel, the factory has successively adopted 40 measures to improve product design and parts processing methods, saving 34 kilograms of steel per shaper. In addition, the workers also inventoried the stock materials and cleaned up 3,400 kilograms of waste materials such as waste gears and waste lead screws that were thrown in the scrap pile. After processing, they were used to replace good materials.

More Than Thirty Good Experiences

Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou – Xinhua News Agency reporter Guo Fenxiang reported: The First Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways, which is responsible for constructing the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway, has summarized more than 30 important experiences in saving materials in the past ten months of this year. According to preliminary statistics, after these experiences were promoted in the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway, Baotou-Lanzhou Railway, and Lanzhou Railway Hub Station projects, they saved the country more than 2,000 tons of cement, 5,000 cubic meters of wood, more than 50 tons of steel, and 150,000 kilograms of gasoline and diesel.

In the past, the First Engineering Bureau did not pay much attention to the advanced experiences created by the workers. After criticizing this bureaucratic attitude at the beginning of this year, the bureau's leadership style underwent a great change. They soon formed a special office to lead the summary and promotion of advanced experiences, restored the former advanced methods promotion section, and greatly improved the enthusiasm and creativity of the workers. In the past ten months, the workers have not only promoted the advanced experience of the "mortar rubble squeezing method" that was created before, but also successively created more than 30 important advanced experiences for saving various materials, such as "tunnel support standardization," "earth arch instead of wood arch," and "slurry press core method." Now, some of these experiences have been systematically summarized and spread to various construction sites; some have been promoted to other construction sites through experience exchange meetings.

Explore Substitute Raw Materials

Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 27th – Chongqing Cement Plant used a kind of red shale instead of slag as a new cement mixing material, overcoming the difficulty of material shortage this year and completing the annual production increase and economy plan.

The cement production of Chongqing Cement Plant this year increased by nearly half compared with last year, encountering a great difficulty: the supply of mixed materials for cement manufacturing—slag—was insufficient, so that the second quarter's output plan was not completed; at the same time, because the cost of long-distance transportation of slag increased, the cost plan for the first half of the year was also not completed. Later, after the workers actively came up with ideas, red shale was found on a mountain near the factory. After chemical analysis, it was proved that this shale, after calcination, can replace slag to make high-quality hard cement; uncalcined raw shale can be made into ordinary cement.

Since the factory adopted shale to expand production in July, as of the 20th of this month, it has overproduced more than 10,000 tons of cement compared with the national plan.

Continuously Reduce Costs

This newspaper, Kunming – Kunming Locomotive Depot of Kunming Railway Bureau, completed the national cost plan with an average reduction of 6.9% for ten consecutive months, and submitted more than 15,000 yuan of profit on the basis of ensuring and improving the quality of locomotives. The leaders of Kunming Locomotive Depot have always attached great importance to educating cadres and workers to run enterprises diligently and thriftily. At the beginning of this year, the "supply system" thinking of "more people, easier work, no accounting for spending money" was criticized among cadres, and the labor organization was reorganized and improved. Using the surplus labor force to accept tasks entrusted by outside, the labor productivity increased by 9.8% in ten months, and the plan was completed with an excess of 9.3% for ten thousand tons of kilometers. At the same time as adjusting the labor organization, saving fuel and reducing costs were listed as the central content of the advanced producer movement, and workers were mobilized to promote advanced experience. Engineering and technical personnel discovered and summarized about ten kinds of advanced operating experiences through the establishment of original data and in-depth field work, and organized the promotion.

Improve the Utilization Rate of Oil Shale

This newspaper – Northeast Petroleum No. 9 Plant has increased the utilization rate of oil shale to 99.5%. For a long time, due to the backward technical level of this factory, the utilization rate of oil shale was very low, and 10% to 20% of the oil shale could not be used. In 1955, the utilization rate of oil shale only reached 76%. Because oil shale could not be fully utilized, the value of oil shale thrown away in the past three years was more than 2.8 million yuan.

At the end of 1955, the factory established a research institution and organized technicians and workers to study the method of using powdered shale and small pieces of shale. With this method, a large amount of powdered shale and small pieces of shale that could not be used in the past can now be used. In this way, 139,000 tons more oil shale can be utilized throughout the year, reducing production costs by 1.14 million yuan, and several thousand tons more crude oil can be produced.

    增产节约在各地
    用节约保证增产
    据新华社沈阳电　沈阳第二机床厂、沈阳风动工具厂、沈阳自行车厂等七个工厂通过节约，解决了钢材不足的困难，不仅保证了今年不减产，还可以增产一百台钻床、一千四百台凿岩机和两万七千辆自行车。沈阳重型机器厂等十四个机械、电器工厂职工，在八个月的时间里节约了四千六百多吨钢材，对保证生产也起了巨大作用。
    沈阳各机械工厂的广大职工，在节约钢材活动中，除了回收大量废钢铁以外，还通过改进产品设计、工艺规程以及加强材料管理等办法节约钢材。风动工具厂、第二机床厂，还利用节约下来的料头，制造出大批产品。第一机床厂工人利用大型套料刀加工一A六二车床主轴，四个月就节约了优质炭素钢三十二吨。变压器厂设计人员改进三种变压器的设计以后，平均每台变压器可以节省矽钢片七吨半。
    学新技术，多生产钢
    据新华社抚顺电　抚顺重型机器厂铸钢车间学习苏联先进经验，把炼钢炉的炉墙改为大块镁砂炉墙，每年能多炼一千多吨钢。
    这个车间的炼钢炉墙过去是用充塞着卤水镁砂混合物的铁管做成的。平均七、八天就要修理一次。工人在修理的时候要冒着高温作业，修理一次要一天多的时间。因此，经常不能完成生产任务，使铸钢件的金工车间，不断发生停工待料现象，造成全厂生产不均衡。
    改用大块镁砂炉墙以后，炉墙寿命大大延长，生产出的铸钢件及时地供应了金工车间，每年还可以节省铁管、镁砂各一百多吨。修炉工人也再不要冒着高温作业了。
    改善产品设计
    新华社讯　北京第二机床厂自9月份起，从改进产品设计等方面节约了十九吨零四百公斤钢材。
    为了节约钢材，这个工厂先后采取了四十种措施来改进产品设计和零件加工的方法，使制造一台牛头刨床所用的钢材比过去节省三十四公斤。此外，职工们还清查了库存材料，把扔在废铁堆里的废齿轮、废丝杠等三千四百公斤废料清理出来，经过加工以后代替好料使用。
    三十多种好经验
    据新华社兰州电　新华社记者郭汾祥报道：担负修筑兰新铁路任务的铁道部第一工程局，在今年十个多月来总结出三十多种节约材料的重要经验。据初步统计，这些经验在兰新铁路、包兰铁路、兰州铁路枢纽站等工程中推广以后，为国家节省了两千多吨水泥、五千立方公尺木料、五十多吨钢材和十五万公斤的汽油、柴油。
    第一工程局过去对于职工们创造的先进经验，并不十分重视。今年年初批判了这种官僚主义态度以后，局的领导作风才有了很大转变，他们不久就组成专门领导总结和推广先进经验的办公室，恢复了以前的先进方法推广科，大大提高了职工的积极性和创造性。十个月以来，职工们不但推广了以前创造的“浆砌片石挤浆法”的先进经验，并且先后创造了“隧道支撑定型化”、“土拱代木拱”、“灰浆压心法”等三十多种节约各种材料的重要先进经验。现在，这些经验有的经过系统总结传播到了各个施工现场；有的通过经验交流会议推广到其他工地。
    发掘代用原料
    据新华社重庆27日电　重庆水泥厂利用一种红色页岩代替炉渣做新的水泥混合材料，克服了今年材料缺乏的困难，完成全年增产节约计划。
    重庆水泥厂今年生产的水泥，比去年增加将近一半，遇到一个很大的困难：是制造水泥的混合材料——炉渣供应不足，以致没有完成第二季度产量计划；同时因为远道运输炉渣的费用增大，上半年的成本计划也没完成。后来，经过职工积极想法，在厂的附近一座山上找到了红色页岩。经过化验证明，这种页岩煅烧以后，能代替炉渣制成质量很好的硬性水泥；未经煅烧的生页岩，可以制成普通水泥。
    7月份这个厂采用页岩扩大生产以来，到本月20日为止，比国家计划超产了一万多吨水泥。
    连续降低成本
    本报昆明讯　昆明铁路局昆明机务段，连续十个月平均降低6.9％完成了国家成本计划，并且在保证和提高机车质量的基础上，上缴了一万五千多元的利润。昆明机务段领导上一向比较重视对干部、工人进行勤俭办企业的教育。今年初，曾在干部中批判了“人多好干活，花钱不算账”的供给制思想，重新调整和健全了劳动组织，利用剩余劳动力接受外面委托的任务，因此十个月内劳动生产率提高了9.8％，万吨公里超额9.3％完成了计划。在调整劳动组织的同时，还把节约燃料、降低成本列为开展先进生产者运动的中心内容，发动职工推广先进经验。工程技术人员通过建立原始资料和深入现场，发现和总结了约十种先进操作经验，并且组织了推广。　　（陈鸿川）
    提高油母页岩利用率
    本报讯　东北石油九厂已经把油母页岩的利用率提高到99.5％。长期以来，这个工厂因为技术水平落后，油母页岩的利用率很低，经常有10％到20％的油母页岩不能利用。1955年油母页岩的利用率只达到76％。因为不能充分利用油母页岩，过去三年，被扔掉的油母页岩价值二百八十多万元。
    1955年底这个工厂成立了研究机构，组织了技术人员和工人，研究出利用粉末页岩和小块页岩的方法。采用这种方法，过去不能利用的大量粉末页岩和小块页岩，能够利用了。这样，全年可以多利用十三万九千吨油母页岩，降低生产成本一百一十四万元，并且还可以多生产出数千吨原油。
