Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai Electric Dispatch: Shanghai is piloting a new standard for inspecting the quality of products in some cotton textile and printing and dyeing factories. The new standard stipulates that cotton textiles are divided into several major categories, and products for different purposes should be woven using cotton yarn of different qualities; cotton yarn of different qualities should be spun from raw cotton of different grades. This can encourage factories to use and conserve cotton more rationally.

In the past, cotton textile factories in Shanghai generally used cotton based solely on fiber length. Whether it was clothing fabric, knitwear, or lining fabric and flour sack fabric, they invariably required the use of cotton yarn with a smooth appearance and few impurities. In order to meet the standards for cotton yarn, yarn factories inevitably increased cotton waste during the spinning process, thus increasing the consumption of raw cotton. On the other hand, low-grade cotton had no outlet and had to be mixed with good cotton for use. The implementation of the new quality inspection standards will better promote the classified use of raw cotton. For example, the cotton yarn used for weaving lining fabric can be spun from poorer quality cotton, while the cotton yarn used for weaving clothing fabric can be spun from better quality cotton.

In addition, the new standard also stipulates that yarn factories, cloth factories, and printing and dyeing factories should strengthen cooperation in the future. If the quality of the finished printed and dyed products is reduced due to the poor quality of the gray fabric, the relevant cloth factory should be responsible for compensation; similarly, if the quality of the cotton cloth is reduced due to the poor quality of the cotton yarn, the yarn factory should be responsible for compensation.

This experiment is being uniformly arranged by the Ministry of Textile Industry, and it is planned to fully implement it next year after gaining experience.

    上海试行纺织品质量新标准
    用不同等级的原棉，制不同用途的产品
    据新华社上海电　上海有一部分棉纺织和印染厂试行一种新的检验产品质量标准。新的标准规定：棉纺织品分为几大类，不同用途的产品，使用不同质量的棉纱来织；不同质量的棉纱用不同等级的原棉来纺。这样，可以促使各厂更合理地使用和节约棉花。
    上海各棉纺织厂过去大体上只按照纤维长度来使用棉花，无论是服装用布、针织品或是夹里布、面粉袋布等，一律要求用外观光洁、含杂质少的棉纱来织。纱厂为了使棉纱达到标准，难免在纺纱过程中增加落棉，因而原棉消耗量增加；另一方面，低级棉花没有出路，不得不搭在好棉花中使用。实行新的质量检验标准以后，就可以更好地推动原棉分类使用。如织夹里布所用的棉纱可以拿差一些的棉花来纺，织服装用布的棉纱可以拿好一些的棉花来纺。
    此外，新的标准还规定，今后纱厂、布厂和印染工厂之间要加强协作。如果由于坯布质量不好而造成印染成品质量低落的损失，应由有关布厂负责赔偿；同样，由于棉纱质量不好而造成棉布质量低落的损失，应由纱厂负责赔偿。
    这项试验是由纺织工业部统一布置的，准备在取得经验以后，再在明年全面实行。
