Xinhua News Agency, London, November 5th. (By our correspondent Peng Di) Eden's reckless invasion of Egypt in disregard of the United Nations Charter and domestic and international public opinion is creating the risk of a split within the Conservative Party itself.

    The resignation of Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Nutting shows that many Conservative Members of Parliament who voted against the Labour Party's motion of censure against the government in the House of Commons on November 2nd against their consciences harbored inner pain and were dissatisfied with the government's policies.

    Opposition within the Conservative Party to the government's policy on the Suez Canal issue was initially expressed by William Yates at the Conservative Party conference in Landudno. On the 3rd, Cyril Osborne reiterated this opposition, telling the House of Commons that many Conservative MPs "feel extremely uneasy and disturbed." He believed that the mere fact that bombs were being used was more disturbing to many ordinary people than anything else. He bravely advised Eden in front of the party supervisors: "Bombing should cease whenever possible - and I hope it is entirely possible."

    It is estimated that about forty Conservatives share Osborne's views.

### 侵埃政策引起公愤  英国保守党内部发生分歧

    侵埃政策引起公愤
    英国保守党内部发生分歧
    新华社伦敦5日电　本社记者彭迪报道：由于艾登无视联合国宪章和国内外舆论悍然侵略埃及，保守党本身正面临着分裂的危险。
    外交部国务大臣纳丁的辞职表明，11月2日在下议院违背着自己的良心投票反对工党对政府的弹劾案的许多保守党员，他们的心中怀着隐痛，并且对政府的政策感到不满。
    保守党内有人不赞成政府对苏伊士运河问题的政策，他们的态度最初是由威廉·耶茨在兰达诺的保守党会议上表现出来的。3日西里尔·奥斯本再一次地表示了这种不赞成的态度，他在下议院说，许多保守党议员“感觉极其不安和烦恼”。他认为，使用炸弹这样一个事实，对于许多老百姓说来，比其他任何事情都更加使他们感到不安。他在党的监督员的面前极其勇敢地劝告艾登说：“只要有可能——我希望完全有可能——就应该停止轰炸。”
    据估计，大约有四十个保守党人同奥斯本抱有同样的意见。
