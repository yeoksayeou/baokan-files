State-owned Farms Should Also Develop Diversified Economy
(Discussing the Conditions and Past Lessons of Chahayang Farm's Development of Sideline Occupations)
    Ding Lishu

    The Chahayang Irrigation Area in Gannan County, Heilongjiang Province, is the best of the three famous irrigation areas in Northeast China. In this irrigation area, which stretches over a hundred li, all the land is the most fertile black calcium soil, with flat terrain and crisscrossing rivers. The large and small canals within the irrigation area, totaling over 1,300 kilometers in length, are as dense as a spider web. There are also scattered ponds and reservoirs, and lush grasslands. This area can not only develop agricultural production on a large scale, but also develop various kinds of production such as animal husbandry, fish farming, and afforestation. The state-owned Chahayang Farm is located in the center of this rich plain.

    However, Chahayang Farm has not effectively utilized these rich natural resources to develop a diversified economy. In addition to simply planting rice and a few other crops, animal husbandry, fishery, and forestry have not been well developed. Due to the very singular operation, in the production income of 1955, the income from crop cultivation accounted for 99.12%, and the income from animal husbandry accounted for 0.08%. In the planned total income for 1956, the income from crop cultivation accounted for 98.98%, and the income from animal husbandry accounted for only 1.02%.

    Because a diversified economy has not been developed, the farm produces a large amount of agricultural by-products every year, which are far from being fully utilized. For example, several thousand tons of rice husks and grass seeds are produced every year, but they are not used to develop pig farming. Tens of thousands of tons of rice straw (which is good feed for cattle) are produced every year, but they are simply discarded in the fields and burned. Due to the underdevelopment of animal husbandry, there is an extreme shortage of manure needed for farmland. In the past few years, farmland was not fertilized at all, and in recent years, mainly chemical fertilizers have been used. This year, the area fertilized with farmyard manure only accounts for about 5% of the sown area. Due to the long-term lack of organic fertilizer, some land has begun to salinize (practice has proved that the application of farmyard manure can not only increase yield by about 20%, but also is a good method to restore soil fertility and prevent soil salinization).

    Due to the underdevelopment of animal husbandry, the farm cannot even guarantee the meat supply for its own employees.

    In addition, the "one-track" operation brings another serious problem: a large amount of labor is unused during the slack season. The working days of all agricultural workers used for crop cultivation only account for 64.5% of the total working days; while the number of idle and stoppage days accounts for 42%. In the winter slack season of 1956, there were about 300,000 idle workdays. The farm needs a large amount of straw bags, straw ropes, and willow branches for production and capital construction projects every year. According to incomplete statistics, in the first half of 1956 alone, the farm spent more than 150,000 yuan on purchasing straw bags, straw ropes, willow branches and other items from the outside. In fact, these materials can be produced on the spot within the farm.

    The income of Chahayang Farm relies almost entirely on crop cultivation. If crops are affected by natural disasters, it will seriously affect income. From 1950 to 1953, due to certain natural disasters, the farm suffered serious losses. Even in years with good harvests, relying solely on one or two crops as the main source of income, the profit at most only accounted for 2.4% of the state's investment in the farm. From 1948 to 1955, although the state invested a lot of money, the farm not only failed to accumulate funds for the state, but also lost more than 700,000 yuan.

    Chahayang Farm has quite favorable conditions for developing a diversified economy. At present, the entire farm can produce a total of more than 4,200 tons of grain, grass seeds, bran, etc. every year. If used for pig farming, it can raise about 9,000 pigs every year. If a large amount of wild grass, wild vegetables, and coarse feed such as soybean hairs, soybean leaves, and soybean pod skins are collected, and a portion of refined feed is planted in a planned way, the entire farm can raise at least 20,000 fattened pigs every year. These pigs can produce 120,000 tons of manure. Using rice straw as feed, at least 1,000 head of cattle can be raised for transportation and traction of agricultural implements. The farm has two small reservoirs that can be used for fish farming. As long as the necessary repairs are carried out, freshwater fisheries can be developed, and about 1,600 tons of fish can be produced every year. There are more than 450 kilometers of irrigation canal banks where willow branches can be planted, which can produce a large amount of willow branches and protect the embankments at the same time. In the turn of summer and autumn, using seven or eight days of slack time, the entire farm's workers can cut 4 million bundles of grass. These grasses can be woven into 1 million straw bags, and can solve the problem of 100,000 slack season labor and rainy day stoppages. In addition, afforestation, chicken raising, and duck raising can also be carried out.

    Chahayang Farm has such great potential, so why has a diversified economy not been developed for a long time? There are many reasons for this, such as insufficient technical strength, lack of equipment, and so on. However, the main reason is that the farm's management ideology one-sidedly emphasizes agriculture and neglects sideline occupations. They believe that engaging in animal husbandry and sideline production is troublesome and yields little profit, and it is better to concentrate on growing crops well. Farm leaders rarely consider how to develop animal husbandry and sideline production.

    This single-minded approach has been criticized by the Northeast Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in the past. Chahayang Farm has successively operated some animal husbandry and sideline production, setting up some stalls. However, the result of the operation was that every item lost money. Finally, they did not correctly summarize the experience and lessons, but returned to the old path of simply engaging in agriculture.

    The reasons for the losses in sideline production in the past were mainly due to incorrect management ideology and management methods. For example, when operating straw bag production, instead of using locally produced rice straw, wild grass, and slack season labor in the grassroots production units, a straw bag factory was set up in a market town dozens of miles away from the grassroots production units, transporting raw materials from afar, hiring long-term workers, and creating superfluous management personnel. Of course, this could not be managed well. When the operation lost money, people did not carefully analyze the reasons, and thought that weaving straw bags was not suitable for farm production, so they stopped the operation. Another example is in the development of cattle raising, a cattle farm was set up separately, and the breeds were not good. More than 400 cattle were neither used nor fed rice straw; the cow manure produced was not fully utilized in the farmland due to the long distance from the grain production team and the difficulty of transportation. Finally, the grass and feed for the cattle were reduced, making the cattle skinny and getting worse as they were raised. In order to develop chicken raising, some chickens were bought from local farmers. Most of these chickens were old chickens that should have been culled, and the breeds were not good, so most of them did not lay eggs. In order to develop duck raising, a large number of native ducks were purchased, which were neither suitable for meat nor could produce a large number of eggs; and due to improper feeding, a large number of ducks died. Another example is that although a group of people was stationed in the fish farm, because the necessary fish farming technical measures were not implemented, only some wild catfish and crucian carp were caught and raised in the reservoir. In the reservoir with a water area of more than 400 hectares, only 40 to 50 tons of fish are caught every year. The more stalls set up, the heavier the burden carried, and the result could not but be failure.

    Based on the experience and lessons of the past eight or nine years, Chahayang Farm has gradually clearly realized the importance of developing a diversified economy, and has now begun to take many concrete measures to develop diversified operations. In 1956, the farm has renovated a small reservoir with a water area of 200 hectares, and plans to start raising good breeds of freshwater fish here next year. In 1956, a batch of necessary livestock sheds have been added to prepare conditions for the large-scale development of animal husbandry. The farm's superior authorities also give great support to the farm in reversing the tendency of single-minded operation and developing a diversified economy.

    We believe that as long as the farm truly attaches importance to the development of a diversified economy, and adopts correct management methods, strengthens specific leadership, the diversified economy of Chahayang Farm will definitely develop correctly, and this farm will definitely be able to make more contributions to the country.

    国营农场也该发展多种经济
    （谈查哈阳农场发展副业的条件和过去的经验教训）
    丁履枢
    黑龙江省甘南县查哈阳灌溉区是东北有名的三大灌溉区中最好的一个。在这个灌溉区里，纵横百余里全部是最肥沃的黑钙土，地势平坦，江河交错。灌溉区内一千三百多公里长的大小渠道密如蛛网。这里还有星罗棋布的池塘、水库，有肥美的大草原。这里不仅可以大量地发展农业生产，而且可以大量地发展牧畜、养鱼和植树造林等各式各样的生产。国营查哈阳农场就建立在这个富饶的平原的中心。
    可是，查哈阳农场却没有有效地利用这些富饶的自然资源来发展多种经济。除了单纯地种植水稻及其他少数的几种农作物以外，畜牧业、渔业和林业都没有很好地发展。由于经营十分单一，在生产收入中，1955年作物种植业的收入占99.12％，畜牧业的收入占0.08％。1956年计划总收入中，作物种植业的收入占98.98％，畜牧业的收入也只占1.02％。
    由于多种经济没有发展起来，农场每年生产大量的农业副产物，都远没有充分利用。例如，每年有几千吨的谷壳和草种子，却没有利用它们来发展养猪业。每年生产数万吨稻草（这是牛的好饲料），却只是丢在田间放火烧掉。由于畜牧业不发达，农田所需要的粪肥就极端缺乏。前几年农田根本不施肥，最近几年来主要是施用化学肥料。今年施用厩肥的面积也只占播种面积的5％左右，由于长期不施有机肥料，有些土地已经开始盐碱化（实践证明，施用厩肥不仅可以提高产量20％左右，而且是恢复地力防止土壤盐碱化的好方法）。
    由于畜牧业很不发达，农场连本场职工的肉食也不能保证。
    此外，经营的“单打一”又带来一个严重的问题：农闲期间大量的劳动力无处使用。全场农业工人用于农作物种值业生产的工作日仅占总工作日数的64.5％；而闲工、停工的日数却占42％。1956年冬闲工约有三十万个。农场里生产、基本建设工程年年需要大量的草袋、草绳和柳条。据不完全统计，仅仅1956年上半年农场从外部购入的草袋、草绳和柳条等几项，就支出了十五万多元。其实，这些器材是可以就地取材在场内生产的。
    查哈阳农场的收入几乎全部依靠农作物种植业，如果作物受到自然灾害，就会严重地影响收入。1950年到1953年，由于遇到某些自然灾害，农场发生严重亏损。就是收成较好的年头，只靠一两种农作物为主要收入，营利最多的时候也不过只占国家对农场投资的2.4％。从1948年到1955年，虽然国家投入了大量资金，但是农场不但没有为国家积累资金，反而亏损了七十多万元。
    查哈阳农场要发展多种经济，是有相当优越的条件的。现在全场每年可生产出粮食谷、草种子、糠麸等共四千二百多吨，如果用来养猪，大约每年可养九千多头。如果再大量地收集野草、野菜和豆毛、豆叶、豆荚皮等粗饲料，并有计划地种植一部分精饲料，全场每年至少可养肥猪二万头。这些猪可生产粪肥十二万吨。利用稻草作饲料，最少可饲养运输和牵引农具用的黄牛一千头。农场现有可供养鱼的小型水库两处，只要进行必要的整修，就可以发展淡水渔业，每年大约可产鱼一千六百吨。灌溉渠道两岸可以栽植柳条的共有四百五十多公里长，可产大量柳条，同时可以保护堤岸。在夏秋之交，利用七、八天农闲时间，全场工人就可以割草四百万捆。用这些草可织成草袋一百万个，并能解决十万个农闲人工和阴雨停工的问题。此外，还可以植树造林、养鸡、养鸭。
    查哈阳农场既有这样巨大的潜力，为什么多种经济很长时间没有发展起来呢？这里有许多原因，例如技术力量不足，设备缺乏等等。但是，最主要的原因却是农场经营思想上片面地重视农业，轻视副业。他们认为搞畜牧和副业生产麻烦多、油水少，不如集中力量种好农作物。农场领导人员很少考虑如何发展畜牧和副业生产的问题。
    这种经营单一化的做法，过去曾经受到中共中央东北局的批评。查哈阳农场曾先后经营了一些畜牧业和副业生产，摆了一些摊子。可是，经营的结果，是项项赔钱。最后，他们没有正确地总结经验教训，却又返回到老路上去，单纯经营农业。
    过去副业生产发生亏损的原因，主要是经营思想和经营方法不对头。例如经营草袋生产的时候，不在基层生产单位利用就地出产的稻草、野草和农闲人工来进行，却在距离基层生产单位数十里以外的集镇设立草袋厂，从远地运送原料，雇用长期工人，虚设管理人员，人浮于事，这样当然不能经营好。经营赔钱了，人们不去细致地分析原因，就认为织草袋不适合农场生产，于是就停止经营了。再如在发展养牛业上，单独设立了养牛场，品种又不好，四百多头黄牛，既不使用，也不喂给稻草；生产的牛粪，因距离谷物生产队太远，运输困难，也未能充分利用到农田上。最后是对牛减草减料，弄得黄牛骨瘦如柴，越养越坏。为了发展养鸡业，就从当地农民手中收买一些鸡。这些鸡大都是该淘汰的老鸡，品种又不好，因此大部分不产蛋。为了发展养鸭业，就大量地购买土种鸭子，既不适合肉用，又不能大量产蛋；又因饲养不当，鸭子大量死亡。又如鱼场里虽设有一批人员，但是因没有实行必要的养鱼技术措施，仅仅是在水库里捕捉一些野生的鲇鱼、鲫鱼养起来。在四百多公顷水面的水库里，每年才只捕鱼四、五十吨。摊子摆得越多，包袱背得越重，结果就不能不失败了。
    查哈阳农场根据八、九年来的经验教训，逐渐明确地认识到了发展多种经济的重要性，现在已经开始采取许多具体措施，发展多种经营。1956年该场已经整修了一处二百公顷水面的小水库，计划明年开始在这里养殖良好品种的淡水鱼。1956年已经增建了一批必要的畜舍，为大量发展畜牧业准备条件。农场的上级机关对于这个农场扭转经营单一化的偏向、发展多种经济，也给予很大的支持。
    我们相信，只要农场真正重视发展多种经济，并且采取正确的经营方法，加强具体领导，查哈阳农场的多种经济一定能够正确地发展起来，这个农场一定能对国家有更多的贡献。
