Xinhua News Agency, 19th — The Beijing No. 1 Machine Tool Plant has launched a plant-wide material saving campaign. The technical section formulated fifteen technical measures, including improving process methods, improving operating techniques, and reducing steel consumption in products, and proposed seventeen topics for implementing these measures, organizing technical personnel to study and resolve them. Workers have also put forward more than twenty rationalization proposals for implementing the measures. The blanking shop has begun to trial reducing material consumption for universal milling machine forgings. Workers improved the fixed scale on the sawing machine and replaced the large scale used for inspection with a small scale, which has reduced the average tolerance from 3% to 1.5% during the initial blanking process. Centralized blanking methods have also been implemented for steel plate materials. In the past, decentralized blanking in various workshops resulted in significant waste. Now, the blanking shop concentrates all steel plate parts for blanking together, allowing for nesting methods to be used, saving 9.5 kilograms of steel plate per hundred kilograms. Waste ends and edge materials are also concentrated for reuse or recycling.

The factory also mobilized employees to save steel in all aspects. The factory held an exhibition of defective products and waste tools, and formulated measures such as waste material recovery and rewards for saving raw materials. Workers Ma Zhende, Guo Xianling, and others from the forging workshop saved more than one hundred kilograms of good steel in November by utilizing waste materials. Previously accumulated unusable material ends in the factory warehouse have all been utilized by the blanking shop. The blanking shop has also carried out waste steel regeneration work, collecting discarded parts from the workshops, processing them into usable materials, and delivering them to various workshops for application. From the end of October to the present, more than 800 kilograms of waste steel have been regenerated.

    北京第一机床厂用具体措施组织节约
    全厂职工掀起节约钢材热潮
    新华社19日讯　北京第一机床厂展开了全厂性的材料节约运动。技术科制定出改进工艺方法、改进操作技术和减少产品钢材消耗等十五项技术措施，并且提出十七项实现措施的课题，组织技术人员研究解决。工人也提出了二十多项实现措施的合理化建议。下料间开始试行减少万能铣的锻件的材料消耗，工人改进了锯床上的固定标尺，并把检验用的大磅秤改为小磅秤，已使原下料时的公差数平均3％降低到1.5％。对钢板材料也实行了集中下料的办法。过去各车间分散下料浪费很大，现在下料间把各种用钢板制的另件集中起来一起下料，就可以利用套裁的方法，每百公斤钢板能节省九点五公斤。废料头料边也都可以集中起来再加以利用或回炉重炼。
    工厂还发动职工从各方面节约钢材。工厂举办了废品、废工具展览会，并且制定了废料回收、节约原材料奖励等办法。锻工车间工人马振德、郭显苓等，11月份利用废料共节省了一百多公斤好钢材。工厂仓库里过去积压没有用处的料头全被下料间加以利用。下料间还进行了废钢铁再生工作，把车间的废活拣回来，加工制成可用材料，交各车间应用，10月底到现在已使八百多公斤废钢材再生。
