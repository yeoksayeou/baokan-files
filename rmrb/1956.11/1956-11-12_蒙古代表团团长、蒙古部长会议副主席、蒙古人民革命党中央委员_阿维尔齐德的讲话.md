Respected Chairman, Comrades, Friends:
    Today, the entire Chinese people, and all progressive people of the world, are commemorating the 90th anniversary of the birth of Sun Yat-sen, the glorious son of the Chinese people and a great revolutionary democrat. Mr. Sun Yat-sen dedicated his glorious life to the independence and freedom of the Chinese people.
    An era of the Chinese revolution is linked to the name of Mr. Sun Yat-sen. He led the Chinese revolutionary movement for forty years.
    Mr. Sun Yat-sen was a true revolutionary, a staunch democrat, and a passionate patriot. He deeply believed in the victory of the Chinese people's revolution, in the ability of the Chinese people to defeat their most ferocious enemies—feudalism, imperialism, and their comprador bourgeoisie—and in the victory of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese people.
    One of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's great achievements was that he prepared the Chinese revolution and led this revolution "in accordance with the trend of the world and the needs of the people."
    With the development of the revolution and the revolutionization of the masses, Mr. Sun Yat-sen abandoned the ideas of bourgeois democratic revolution and adopted the program of people's democratic revolution.
    With the development of the revolution, Mr. Sun Yat-sen made a broader and more complete explanation of the Three People's Principles that he advocated. Nationalism meant fighting against imperialism and striving for national independence and equality. The slogan of Democracy was to implement a people's democratic system. The Principle of People's Livelihood demanded land to the tiller, improved workers' lives, and the restriction of capital.
    The victory of the October Revolution, the establishment of the Soviet state, the emergence and growth of the revolutionary proletariat in China, the emergence and growth of the leader of the Chinese people—the Chinese Communist Party, and the unprecedented upsurge of the Chinese peasants' revolutionary sentiments, all led the far-sighted revolutionary Mr. Sun Yat-sen to put forward the three fundamental policies of revolution: alliance with Russia, alliance with the Communist Party, and assistance to peasants and workers.
    Mr. Sun Yat-sen was a great revolutionary who completely dedicated his life to the cause of the working people. He foresaw and deeply believed in the future of his people. When the political situation in China was still very difficult, when the communist workers' movement had not yet been consolidated in China, Mr. Sun Yat-sen called on his people to learn from those who, under the leadership of the Communist Party, had achieved victory and begun to build a communist society. He declared, "We are good friends of communism," and he cooperated with the communists.
    Mr. Sun Yat-sen was an ardent fighter for peace. The issue of defending world peace was one of the most important and major issues in the program of the Tongmenghui led by Mr. Sun Yat-sen.
    Mr. Sun Yat-sen's contribution to the Chinese revolution and his merits to the Chinese people are great. The Chinese people, who respect these great achievements of Mr. Sun Yat-sen, are commemorating the 90th anniversary of the birth of their glorious son today and will forever keep his great cause in their clear memory.
    The name of Mr. Sun Yat-sen, the warrior against the Qing dynasty's autocracy, received a strong response among the Mongolian people who were then groaning under the oppression of the Manchus.
    The Qing dynasty's autocracy was not only the enemy of the Mongolian people but also the enemy of the Chinese people. Because this autocracy attempted to perpetuate the feudal oppression imposed on the Chinese people and to perpetuate China's division and backwardness.
    The 1911 Xinhai Revolution, led by Mr. Sun Yat-sen, triggered a great upsurge in the Mongolian national liberation movement.
    The struggle against the Qing dynasty's feudal lords' autocratic and inhuman imperialist oppression swept through extremely different social strata in Mongolia, and in December 1911, an autonomous government was established in Outer Mongolia.
    In 1921, after the victory of the people's revolution, which was achieved under the influence of the October Socialist Revolution, and the establishment of the Mongolian People's Republic, the Mongolian people gained true independence. The independence and international status of the Mongolian People's Republic have been continuously consolidated since that time, and the establishment of the People's Republic of China has consolidated our country's international status as never before.
    The Chinese Communist Party has accepted and developed the excellent revolutionary traditions of the Chinese people and has also inherited Mr. Sun Yat-sen's ideas about liberating China from feudalism and imperialist oppression. The Chinese Communist Party has victoriously led the Chinese people to overcome their historical enemies. As a result, the People's Republic of China was established. It is a very important factor for peace, democracy, and socialism. Its establishment has the same enormous significance for the awakening and liberation of the colonial world.
    The Chinese Communist Party has realized Mr. Sun Yat-sen's great ideal: "Hoping that dawn will soon break, at which time the Soviet Union will welcome a strong and independent China as a good friend and ally, and the two countries will join hands in the great battle to fight for the freedom of the oppressed nations of the world to achieve victory."
    The Chinese Communist Party is good at creatively applying Marxism-Leninism to build a new China and build it into a great socialist industrial power. The Chinese Communist Party educates the Chinese people with the spirit of proletarian internationalism.
    The Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people and the Chinese government it has educated have given great unselfish assistance to our country's economic and cultural construction.
    While receiving the enormous assistance given to us by the Soviet Union, we have also received assistance from the People's Republic of China, which has greatly promoted the rapid development of our country's socialist construction.
    The Mongolian people express deep respect and lofty commemoration to the great revolutionary Sun Yat-sen.
    The best proof of respecting and commemorating him is the unbreakable fraternal friendship between the Mongolian and Chinese people, which is developing and consolidating. This friendship is forged by the blood shed in the common revolutionary struggle for the freedom and independence of our two countries. This friendship is consolidated under the spirit of proletarian internationalism.
    Comrades and friends! On the occasion of commemorating the 90th anniversary of the birth of Sun Yat-sen, the glorious son of the Chinese people and a great revolutionary democrat, the Mongolian people extend warm greetings to the Chinese people and hope that under the leadership of the glorious Chinese Communist Party headed by Chairman Mao Zedong, it will achieve new achievements in the socialist construction of the country.
    The glorious image of the great Sun Yat-sen will last forever!
    Long live the unbreakable fraternal friendship between the Mongolian and Chinese people!

### 蒙古代表团团长、蒙古部长会议副主席、蒙古人民革命党中央委员  阿维尔齐德的讲话

    蒙古代表团团长、蒙古部长会议副主席、蒙古人民革命党中央委员
    阿维尔齐德的讲话尊敬的主席，同志们，朋友们：
    今天全中国人民，全世界的进步人民也和他一起在纪念中国人民的光荣儿子，伟大的革命民主主义者孙中山先生的九十周年诞辰。孙中山先生为中国人民的独立和自由已贡献出了自己光荣的一生。
    中国革命的一个时代是和孙中山先生的名字联系在一起的。他在四十年的过程中领导了中国的革命运动。
    孙中山先生是一个真正的革命家，始终不渝的民主主义者和热情的爱国主义者，他深信中国人民革命的胜利，深信中国人民能够战胜其最凶恶的敌人——封建主义、帝国主义及其代办买办资产阶级——和伟大中国人民复兴的胜利。
    孙中山先生的丰功伟绩之一就是他准备了中国革命并“适乎世界之潮流，合乎人群之需要”领导了这个革命。
    随着革命的发展和群众的革命化，孙中山先生抛弃了资产阶级民主主义革命的思想并且采用了人民民主主义革命的纲领。
    随着革命的发展，孙中山先生对于他所宣扬的三大人民革命主义做了更广泛而完整的解释。民族主义就是要以斗争来反对帝国主义和争取民族独立和平等。民权主义的口号是实行人民民主制度。民生主义是要求耕者有其田，改善工人生活，节制资本。
    十月革命的胜利，苏维埃国家的成立，中国国内革命无产阶级的产生和成长，中国人民的领袖——中国共产党的产生和成长，中国农民革命情绪的空前高涨，都使得有远见的革命家孙中山先生提出了革命的基本的三大政策：联俄、联共、扶助农工。
    孙中山先生是一个伟大的革命家，他把自己的一生完全献给了劳动人民的事业。他预见到了并且深信自己人民的未来。当中国的政治状况还是很困难的时候，当共产主义的工人运动在中国国内尚未巩固的时候，孙中山先生就号召自己的人民去向那些在共产党员领导下取得了胜利和开始建设共产主义社会的人们学习。他声称：“我们是共产主义的好朋友”，他和共产党员们进行了合作。
    孙中山先生是为和平而奋斗的热诚战士。保卫世界和平问题是孙中山先生所领导的同盟会纲领中一个最重大而主要的问题。
    孙中山先生对中国革命的贡献和对中国人民的功绩是伟大的。尊崇孙中山先生这些丰功伟绩的中国人民在今天纪念自己光荣儿子的九十周年诞生，并把他的伟大事业永远留存在自己清晰的记忆中。
    孙中山先生，这位反对清廷专政的战士的名字在当时尚呻吟在满族压迫下的蒙古人民中获得了强烈的反应。
    清廷专政不仅是蒙古人民的敌人，同时也是中国人民的敌人。因为这一专政曾力图使强加在中国人民身上的封建压迫永恒下来，使中国割据局面和落后状态永恒下来。
    1911年在孙中山先生领导下的辛亥革命引起了蒙古民族解放运动的巨大高涨。
    反对清廷封建主专政的惨无人道的帝国主义压迫的斗争席卷了蒙古极其不同的社会阶层，并且在1911年12月1日在外蒙古就已经成立了自治政府。
    1921年，在十月社会主义革命影响下所达到的人民革命胜利和蒙古人民共和国成立之后蒙古人民获得了真正的独立。蒙古人民共和国从这个时候起的独立和国际地位不断地巩固起来了，而中华人民共和国的成立就更加空前地巩固了我国的国际地位。
    中国共产党接受并发展了中国人民的优秀革命传统，也继承了孙中山先生关于把中国从封建主义和帝国主义压迫下解放出来的思想。中国共产党胜利地引导中国人民战胜了历来的敌人。其结果就建立了中华人民共和国。它是和平、民主与社会主义极重要一个因素。它的建立对殖民主义世界的觉醒和解放同样有着巨大的意义。
    中国共产党实现了孙中山先生的伟大理想：“希望不久即将破晓，斯时苏联以良友及盟国而欢迎强盛独立之中国，两国在争世界被压迫民族自由之大战中，携手并进以取得胜利。”
    中国共产党善于创造性地应用马克思列宁主义来建设新中国并把它建设成为伟大的社会主义工业强国。中国共产党用无产阶级国际主义精神教育中国人民。
    中国共产党和它所教育下来中国人民和中国人民政府对我国经济和文化建设给了很大的无私地援助。
    我们在获得苏联给我们的巨大的援助的同时，也得到了中华人民共和国的援助，这就大大地促进着我国社会主义建设事业的迅速发展。
    蒙古人民对伟大的革命家孙中山先生表示深切的敬意和崇高的纪念。
    尊敬他和纪念他的最好证明就是正在发展着和正在巩固着的蒙古人民与中国人民之间的牢不可破的兄弟般的友谊。这一友谊是由为我们两国的自由与独立而进行的共同革命斗争中所流的鲜血结成的。这一友谊是在无产阶级国际主义精神下巩固起来的。
    同志们和朋友们！在纪念中国人民的光荣儿子和伟大的革命民主主义者孙中山先生九十周年诞辰的时候，蒙古人民向中国人民致以热烈的敬礼，并希望它在以毛泽东主席为首的光荣的中国共产党的领导下，在国家社会主义建设中取得新的成就。
    伟大的孙中山先生的光辉形象永垂不朽！
    蒙中人民的牢不可破的兄弟友谊万岁！
