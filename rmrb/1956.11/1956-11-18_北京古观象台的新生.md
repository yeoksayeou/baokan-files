The Rebirth of the Beijing Ancient Observatory
Chen Zungui, Director of the Beijing Planetarium

South of Jianguomen in Beijing stands a world-renowned ancient observatory. It was built in the sixteenth year of the Yuan Dynasty's Zhiyuan period (1279 AD), and was then called the Sitian Platform, belonging to the Taishi Academy. In the Ming Dynasty, it was renamed the Star Observation Platform, and in the Qing Dynasty, it was called the Observatory, belonging to the Qin Tian Jian (Imperial Astronomical Bureau). It is now the Beijing Ancient Astronomical Instrument Exhibition Hall, part of the Beijing Planetarium.

Installed on the observatory are eight instruments manufactured during the Qing Dynasty: the celestial globe, ecliptic theodolite, azimuth instrument, altitude-azimuth instrument, quadrant, equatorial theodolite, quadrant, and armillary sphere. They are all cast in bronze, with the legs and pillars intricately carved with dragons and other patterns. Originally, the platform also housed instruments made during the Ming Dynasty, such as the armillary sphere, simplified instrument, gnomon, and clepsydra, but these were moved to the Purple Mountain Observatory in Nanjing by the reactionary government after the September 18th Incident.

These instruments manufactured during the Ming and Qing dynasties are priceless treasures in terms of both astronomy and art. During the Boxer Rebellion in 1900, the Eight-Nation Alliance invaded Beijing, and the imperialist countries of France and Germany looted these instruments. The instruments looted by France were placed in the French Embassy in China, and were only returned to our country in 1902. The instruments looted by Germany were moved to the Sanssouci Palace in Potsdam, and were only returned to Beijing from Germany in 1921, according to the Treaty of Versailles after the First World War.

In addition to these Qing Dynasty instruments still installed in their original positions for everyone to visit, the Beijing Ancient Astronomical Instrument Exhibition Hall has recently added five other exhibition rooms. These are the Exhibition Room of Ancient Chinese Astronomical Achievements, the Exhibition Room of Chinese Calendars, the Exhibition Room of Modern Chinese Astronomical Work, the Exhibition Room of Astronomical Pictures and Books, and the Exhibition Room Introducing the Planetarium.

In the Exhibition Room of Ancient Chinese Astronomical Achievements, photographs of celestial phenomena observed by our ancestors and statues of ancient Chinese astronomers are displayed. China is one of the countries in the world where astronomy developed earliest, and our ancestors left behind many records of celestial observations. For example, records of sunspots, prominences, solar eclipses, lunar eclipses, Halley's Comet, the Lyrid meteor shower, and novae are among the earliest and most reliable in the world, and some are even the most detailed; scholars from various countries have expressed admiration and surprise for these records. China also preserves the ruins of the oldest astronomical observatory in the world—the Zhougong Measurement Platform; and there were also outstanding astronomers, such as Zhang Heng (78-139 AD) of the Han Dynasty, Zu Chongzhi (429-500 AD) of the Southern Qi Dynasty, Monk Yi Xing (683-727 AD) of the Tang Dynasty, and Guo Shoujing (1231-1316 AD) of the Yuan Dynasty. From this exhibition room, one can see the brilliant achievements of our ancestors in astronomy.

The Exhibition Room of Chinese Calendars introduces historical materials related to Chinese calendars. Astronomy developed due to the needs of human practical life. One of China's oldest documents, the "Yaodian," contains the record "Reverently observe the vast sky, calculate the phenomena of the sun, moon, and stars, and respectfully teach the people the seasons." This shows that our ancestors had a correct understanding of the "calendar" needed for human practical life. That is to say, in order to calculate the positions of the sun, moon, and stars, our ancestors diligently observed celestial phenomena, discovered their laws, and used these laws to determine the seasons of the year, compiling calendars so that agricultural activities could be carried out in a timely manner. Therefore, the history of ancient Chinese astronomy is also a history of calendars.

The ancient six calendars used in China before the reform of the calendar in the first year of the Han Dynasty's Taichu period (104 BC) have long been lost, and later generations can only know their general outlines through research. From the time the Three Unifications Calendar was adopted in the first year of the Taichu period until the Shixian Calendar was adopted in the early Qing Dynasty, over a period of more than 1,700 years, although more than 70 calendar reforms were carried out and more than 100 calendars were proposed, the principles remained unchanged. The Three Unifications Calendar of the Han Dynasty adopted Deng Ping and Luo Xia Hong's 81-part method (i.e., stipulating that one month is 29 days and 43/81 days); Zu Chongzhi's Daming Calendar of the Southern Qi Dynasty included the precession discovered by Yu Xi (the phenomenon that the pole of the celestial equator revolves around the pole of the ecliptic in a cycle of about 26,000 years is called precession); Fu Renjun of the Tang Dynasty created the Wuyin Yuan Calendar and only then did use the Determination of the Precise朔 (Shuo) (i.e., using the moment when the ecliptic longitude of the sun and moon are equal as朔); Guo Shoujing's Shoushi Calendar of the Yuan Dynasty abolished the ancient calendar era (ancient people had to calculate the calendar with the Jiazi day that happened to be midnight Shuo旦 Winter Solstice, as the beginning of the calculation, which is called the calendar era); these can be said to be the four major reforms of the Chinese calendar. As for the Shixian Calendar of the Qing Dynasty, it adopted Western methods to coordinate with the old Chinese calendar system, and the adoption of the Gregorian calendar after the Xinhai Revolution, although also major reforms, cannot be compared with the previous four reforms in significance.

The calendar exhibition room also displays materials on the Tibetan calendar. From these materials, one can not only know that the Tibetan people are a brave, intelligent, and creative outstanding ethnic group of the motherland, but also know the long history of cultural exchange between the Han and Tibetan ethnic groups. In addition, various Chinese calendars from past dynasties are displayed, and diagrams are used to explain the principles of "year, month, day, solar terms," as well as to emphatically point out that the "nine-palace grid, male and female life palace..." and other statements in the old calendars and the superstition of astrologers that "heavenly secrets cannot be revealed" are unreasonable.

After the Xinhai Revolution, China's astronomical work can be roughly divided into four periods. From 1911 to 1928 was the advocacy period. During this period, the main work was the preparation for the establishment of the Central Observatory, and the takeover of the Qingdao Observatory run by German imperialists; on October 30, 1922, the Astronomical Society was established. At that time, due to the imperialists inciting warlords to carry out civil wars and financial difficulties, astronomical work could not be further developed.

From 1928 to 1937 was the pioneering period. During this period, under the circumstances that the reactionary government did not pay attention to science, thanks to the efforts of astronomers, the Purple Mountain Observatory, designed by the Chinese themselves without any foreign assistance, and the first university observatory in China were established, which can be said to have laid the foundation for modern Chinese astronomy. In 1926 and 1933, China participated in the International Longitude Measurement. In 1935, it formally joined the International Astronomical Union. In 1936, an observation team was sent to the Soviet Union and Japan to observe the solar eclipse, which was the first time China sent scientists abroad for scientific observation.

The twelve years from 1937 to 1949 were the most difficult period for modern Chinese astronomical work, and most of the work was suspended. Thanks to the efforts of astronomers, a small observatory was established in Kunming at that time, and solar eclipse observations were carried out in China in 1941 and 1948.

After the national liberation in 1949, China's astronomical work, like other sciences, was reborn and strengthened. In the past seven years, under the correct leadership of the Party and the government, a series of adjustments, reforms, organizations, and construction work have been carried out, so that China's astronomical work has gradually moved towards a road of serving the construction of the motherland purposefully and systematically, and actively learning from the advanced achievements of astronomy in the Soviet Union and other countries. In this short period, the Purple Mountain Observatory was expanded, and the observatories that originally belonged to foreign imperialism were taken over, so that astronomical observation and research gradually got on track. In addition, the Department of Mathematics and Astronomy of Nanjing University was established to cultivate young people in large numbers and supplement the new forces for the new China's astronomical cause.

The Exhibition Room of Modern Chinese Astronomical Work reflects the above-mentioned situation of modern Chinese astronomical work in our country. In addition to seeing photos of the buildings and equipment of various observatories, you can also see the observation and research being carried out by Chinese astronomical workers. For example, the discovery of minor planets Zijin One and Two and the determination of their positions, the research on the internal structure of the sun, the calculation of aeronautical and marine almanacs, the four steps of time measurement, timekeeping, and time broadcasting for time service, and the work of calculating the faint star catalogue jointly conducted by China and the Soviet Union can be roughly known from the pictures. From this exhibition room, one can see the achievements of the hard struggle of Chinese astronomical workers during the rule of the reactionary government, and at the same time, one can see the contrast between Chinese astronomical work before and after liberation.

In the Exhibition Room of Astronomical Pictures and Books, in addition to pictures of various celestial bodies related to the solar system and stellar systems, astronomical books and periodicals since the Xinhai Revolution are also displayed. These books and periodicals are naturally still incomplete, but many are out of print or not easily seen. From the content of these books and periodicals, it can be seen that modern Chinese astronomy has gradually moved from popularization to improvement.

The Exhibition Room Introducing the Planetarium introduces the situation of the Beijing Planetarium, which is under construction. Since the Beijing Planetarium officially started construction on Frost's Descent last year, thanks to the efforts of engineers from the German Democratic Republic and engineers from the Beijing Municipal Design Institute, the steel frame of the dome of the main building's planetarium hall has been closed before National Day. The structure of this project is still the first in China. Anyone who goes to the Beijing Zoo recently can see the silver-white dome from a distance. This is an observatory specially for popularization, and it will be equipped with a 13-centimeter refracting telescope. In a position symmetrical to the observatory, there is also a meteorological observatory under construction; with the help of the China Meteorological Administration, it will gradually become a more complete meteorological observatory. We strive to complete all the work by National Day next year and meet the audience in the capital. The establishment of the Beijing Planetarium shows the deep friendship between the people of China and Germany. This exhibition room also displays some pictures of the work of planetariums in the Soviet Union and other countries.

In addition, there are two exhibition rooms attached to the popular science box. The popular science box is specially manufactured by the China Association for Science and Technology to cooperate with the call to march towards science and to facilitate the popularization of scientific knowledge in various places.

Since the Beijing Ancient Astronomical Instrument Exhibition Hall met with everyone on May Day this year, there have been many domestic and foreign visitors, who have provided us with many valuable opinions and often give us enthusiastic encouragement. Some Soviet experts said: "Such a site with a long history should be expanded." Everyone's love and support for our work and their expectations for us have increased our confidence in our work. We should work harder to develop and promote the brilliant achievements and glorious traditions of our ancestors in astronomy. (Attached picture)

    北京古观象台的新生
    北京天文馆馆长　陈遵妫
    在北京建国门南边，有一个世界驰名的古观象台。它建筑在元代至元十六年（1279年），当时叫司天台，属于太史院。到明代改为观星台，清代把它叫做观象台，属于钦天监。现在改为北京古代天文仪器陈列馆，属于北京天文馆的一部分。
    在观象台上，现在安装着清代制造的八件仪器，就是天体仪、黄道经纬仪、地平经仪、地平经纬仪、纪限仪、赤道经纬仪、象限仪和玑衡抚辰仪。它们都是用铜铸成的，器脚和柱子雕刻着精细的龙和其他的图案。台上本来还有明代制造的浑仪、简仪、圭表和漏壶等，在九一八事变后，被反动政府搬到南京紫金山天文台去了。
    这些明清时代制造的仪器，在天文学上和艺术上都是无价之宝。1900年义和团运动的时候，八国联军侵占北京，法、德两帝国主义国家曾把这些仪器劫走。法国劫走的仪器，被装在法国驻华使馆，到了1902年才归还我国。德国劫走的则被搬到波茨坦离宫，到了第一次世界大战后，根据凡尔赛和约，于1921年才从德国运回北京。
    北京古代天文仪器陈列馆除这些清代的仪器仍然装在原来的位置以供大家参观外，最近还增辟了其他五个展览室。这就是中国古代天文学成就展览室、中国的历法展览室、中国近代天文工作展览室、天文图片及书刊展览室、天文馆介绍展览室。
    在中国古代天文学成就展览室里，陈列着有关我们祖先所观察的天象的照片和我国古天文学家的塑像。我国是世界上天文学发达最早的国家之一，我们祖先遗留下很多天象观察的记录。比如对于太阳黑子、日珥、日食、月食、哈雷彗星、天琴座流星雨和新星等现象的记录，都是世界上最早最可靠而有的还是最详尽的；各国学者对于这些记录，都表示过钦佩和惊奇。我国还保存着世界上最古的天文台——周公测景台的遗址；还有杰出的天文学家，像汉代的张衡（78——139年）、南齐的祖冲之（429——500年）、唐代的僧一行（683——727年）和元代的郭守敬（1231——1316年）等。从这个展览室里，可以看到我们祖先在天文学上的辉煌成就。
    在中国的历法展览室里，介绍了有关中国历法的史料。天文学是由于人类实际生活的需要而发达起来的。我国最古文献之一的“尧典”就有“钦若昊天，历象日月星辰，敬授人时”的记载，这就可以说明我们祖先对于人类实际生活所需要的“历法”已有了正确的认识。也就是说，我们祖先为了要推算日月星辰，就殷勤地去观察天象，发现它的规律，按它的规律来决定一年的季节，编成历法，使农事能够及时进行。因而我国古代天文学史，也就是一部历法史。
    我国在汉太初元年（公元前104年）改历以前所用的古六历，原本早已散佚，后代推究只能知道其大概。自太初元年改用三统历以后，一直到清初改用时宪历止，在一千七百多年里面，虽然改历的有七十多家，提出的历法有一百多种，而原则没有变更过。汉太初的三统历采用邓平、落下闳的八十一分法（即规定一月为二十九日又八十一分之四十三日）；南齐祖冲之所撰的大明历，计入虞喜所发现的岁差（天球上赤道的极，约以二万六千年的周期绕黄道的极一周的现象叫做岁差）；唐傅仁均造戊寅元历，才用定朔（即以太阳月亮黄经度相等的时刻为朔）；元郭守敬的授时历废除古代的历元（古人算历一定要以甲子那天恰好是夜半朔旦冬至，作为起算的开始，这叫做历元）；这些可以说是中国历法的四次大改革。至于清代的时宪历，采用西洋方法来配合我国旧历的体系，以及辛亥革命以后的采用公历，虽然也是很大的改革，但在意义上不能和前四次的改革相提并论。
    历法展览室里还陈列着西藏历法的资料。从这些资料不独可以知道西藏民族是祖国一个勇敢、智慧、富于创造性的优秀民族，还可以知道汉藏两民族文化交流的悠久历史。此外还陈列着中国历代的多种历书，并用图表来说明“年、月、日、节气”的道理，以及重点地指出旧历书所载那些“九宫格，男女命宫……”等说法和星相家所谓“天机不可泄漏”的迷信是没有道理的。
    辛亥革命以后，中国的天文工作约可分为四个时期。从1911年到1928年是倡导时期。在这个期间，主要是筹建中央观象台的工作，接收了德帝国主义所办的青岛观象台；在1922年10月30日，成立了天文学会。当时，由于帝国主义者挑拨军阀进行内战，经费困难，天文工作得不到进一步开展。
    从1928年到1937年是草创时期。在这期间，在反动政府不重视科学的情况下，由于天文学家的努力，建立了中国人自己设计而毫无外国人帮助的紫金山天文台和中国第一个大学天文台，可以说是打下了我国近代天文学的基础。在1926年和1933年，我国参加了国际经度测量。1935年正式加入国际天文协会。1936年派观测队到苏联和日本去观测日食，是中国第一次派科学家到国外去作科学观测。
    从1937年到1949年的十二年间，是我国近代天文工作最艰苦的时期，工作大部停顿。由于天文工作者的努力，当时还在昆明建立了一个小型的天文台，进行了1941年和1948年在我国境内的日食观测。
    1949年全国解放以后，我国的天文学工作和别的科学一样，得到了新生和壮大。七年来在党和政府的正确领导下，进行了一系列的调整、改革、组织和建设的工作，使我国的天文工作逐步走向有目的有计划地为祖国建设而服务的道路，并且积极学习苏联和其他国家的天文学的先进成就。在这短短的时期，扩建了紫金山天文台，接管了原来属于外国帝国主义的天文台，使天文观测和研究逐渐走上轨道。此外，还建立了南京大学数天系，大批地培养青年，为新中国天文事业补充新生力量。
    在中国近代天文工作展览室里，反映了上述我国近代天文工作的情况。除了可以看到各天文台建筑物和设备的照片外，还可以看到我国天文工作者正在观测和研究的情况。例如小行星紫金一号和二号的发现及其位置的测定，关于太阳内部结构的研究，航空航海历的编算，授时的测时、守时、播时，收时的四个步骤，以及我国和苏联合作的微星星表的计算等工作情形，都可以由图片中得知其大概。从这个展览室里面，可以看出在反动政府统治期间，我国天文工作者的努力斗争的成果，同时可以看出解放前和解放后中国天文工作的对比。
    在天文图片及书刊展览室里面，除了有关太阳系和恒星系的各种天体的图片外，还陈列着辛亥革命以来的天文书刊。这些书刊自然还是不完备，但有很多是绝版的或是不大容易看到的。从这些书刊的内容，可以看出中国近代的天文学，已经从通俗逐渐走向提高的道路。
    在天文馆介绍展览室里，介绍了正在建设中的北京天文馆的情况。北京天文馆在去年霜降正式动工以来，由于民主德国工程师和北京市设计院工程师们的努力，主楼的天象厅圆顶的钢架已经在国庆前夕合拢起来。这个工程的结构在中国讲还是第一次。凡到北京动物园游玩的人，近来都可以远远地看到银白色的圆顶。这是专供普及用的天文台，里面将装置十三厘米的折射望远镜。和天文台相对称的位置，还有一座气象台，也正在建筑中；它在中央气象局帮助下，将逐步成为一个设备较为完善的气象台。我们争取在明年国庆节全部完工，和首都观众见面。北京天文馆的建立，表示着中德两国人民深厚的友谊。这个展览室里还展览了一部分苏联和其他国家的天文馆工作的图片。
    此外还附有科普箱展览室两间。科普箱是中华全国科学技术普及协会为了配合向科学进军的号召，便利各地宣传科学知识而特别制造的。
    北京古代天文仪器陈列馆自今年“五一”和大家见面以来，国内外参观者很多，他们给我们提供很多的宝贵意见，经常给我们热诚的鼓励。有的苏联专家说：“这样有悠久历史的遗址，应该把它扩充起来”。大家对于我们工作的热爱和支持，对于我们的期望，增加了我们工作的信心，我们应该加倍努力，使我们祖先在天文学上的辉煌成就和光荣传统得以发挥光大。（附图片）
