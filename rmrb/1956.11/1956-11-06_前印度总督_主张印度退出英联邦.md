Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, November 4th. According to the Press Trust of India, the former Governor-General of India and veteran Indian politician, C. Rajagopalachari, stated today that India should withdraw from the Commonwealth because Britain has disregarded the United Nations' resolution demanding an immediate ceasefire in Egypt.

    前印度总督
    主张印度退出英联邦
    据新华社新德里4日电　据印度报业托辣斯报道，前印度总督、印度政界元老查·拉贾戈帕拉查里今天发表谈话，主张印度退出英联邦，因为英国蔑视联和国要求它在埃及立即停火的决议。
    他认为，“印度带头这样做将具有重大意义，特别是如果锡兰和巴基斯坦加以仿效的话。”
