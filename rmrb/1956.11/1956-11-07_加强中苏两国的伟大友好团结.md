    Strengthen the Great Friendship and Unity Between China and the Soviet Union
    Lin Boqu, Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Vice President of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association
    Dear Comrades!
    November 7th this year is the 39th anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution. All of us in China are celebrating this great festival with unparalleled excitement!
    The October Revolution was a great event unprecedented in human history, inaugurating a new era in human history. After thousands of years of a society where a minority ruled the majority and a minority exploited the majority, the first socialist society in the world, where the broad masses of working people were masters of their own affairs and no one exploited anyone, appeared on this day. From then on, the exploited and oppressed people of the whole world found the road to liberation and happiness, and the history of all mankind moved forward in a new direction, along the path of socialism. This is the immeasurable and significant contribution that the Soviet people and the Soviet Communist Party have made to us and our descendants.
    We can look back at how enormous the changes have been in the entire world in the thirty-nine years from the great October Socialist Revolution to the present. The Soviet Union has transformed from the backward Russia of the Tsarist era into the most powerful country in the world, completed the great socialist construction, and is striding towards the glorious road of communism. The great Soviet Union has consistently pursued and adhered to a peaceful foreign policy, resolutely opposed war, and used its own practical actions to set an example for the cause of human peace, becoming the strongest fortress for defending world peace. Precisely because of this, all upright and peace-loving people around the world are delighted by every achievement of the Soviet Union.
    On a global scale, the cause of socialism is also developing vigorously. Now many socialist countries have emerged from Europe to Asia, forming a united and friendly socialist family. Socialist ideas have shown greater and greater appeal among workers, peasants, and intellectuals in all countries and are becoming more and more deeply rooted in people's hearts. Under the influence of the October Revolution, the anti-colonialist movement has developed vigorously, especially after the Second World War, more forcefully impacting the crumbling colonialist system. Obviously, today's international situation has undergone fundamental changes. If imperialism still wants to launch wars frantically in order to maintain its colonial rule, its result will surely be defeated.
    We Chinese people are especially deeply grateful to the great October Revolution and our ally, the Soviet Union. We all know that the Chinese people's revolution developed under the influence of the October Revolution. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "The salvo of the October Revolution brought us Marxism-Leninism." The October Revolution pointed out the direction and path of our struggle, inspired our revolutionary people, and during the several domestic revolutionary wars and the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Soviet people extended a hand of sympathy and support to our people. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Soviet Union helped us restore the national economy in all aspects. Subsequently, with the start of planned economic construction in our country, the Soviet Union gave us more and greater assistance. Therefore, our revolutionary victory and our construction achievements are inseparable from the help of the Soviet Union.
    The Chinese people have gained many useful experiences in the long revolutionary struggle, and one of the most important is: it is necessary to strengthen the friendly unity with the Soviet Union and consolidate and develop the great friendship with the Soviet Union. Friendship, unity, and cooperation with the Soviet Union was, is, and will always be our invincible banner. Therefore, we must spare no effort to strengthen friendly unity with the Soviet Union and friendly unity with all socialist countries based on the principles of proletarian internationalism and equality and mutual assistance. Especially today, when the cause of peace, democracy, and socialism is developing irresistibly on the one hand, and the reactionary forces of imperialism are doing everything possible to plunge mankind into another war and to strangle the people's forces on the other, strengthening this unity is of even greater significance!
    Under the light of the October Revolution, let us strive to further strengthen the great friendship and unity between China and the Soviet Union, and strive to strengthen the great unity of all socialist countries!
    Long live the great October Socialist Revolution!
    Long live the permanent and unbreakable friendship between the people of the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union!

    加强中苏两国的伟大友好团结
    中国共产党中央委员会政治局委员 中苏友好协会总会副会长  林伯渠
    亲爱的同志们！
    今年11月7号是伟大的十月社会主义革命三十九周年纪念日，我们全中国人民都怀着无比兴奋的心情来庆祝这个伟大的节日！
    十月革命是人类历史上从来没有过的伟大事件，它开创了人类历史的新纪元。在经历了几千年少数人统治多数人、少数人剥削多数人的社会之后，从这天起在世界上出现了第一个由广大劳动人民当家作主、没有人剥削人的社会主义社会，从此，全世界被剥削和被压迫的人民找到了争取解放和走向幸福的道路，整个人类的历史沿着一个新的方向，沿着社会主义的方向向前发展。这是苏联人民和苏联共产党对我们和我们后代所作的无可估量的重大贡献。
    我们可以在此回顾一下，从伟大的十月社会主义革命到现在的三十九年中，整个世界起了多么巨大的变化。苏联已从沙皇时代的落后俄国变成为世界上最强大的国家，完成了伟大的社会主义建设，并且正在大踏步地向着共产主义的光辉道路迈进。伟大的苏联一贯奉行和坚持和平外交政策，坚决反对战争，并用自己的实际行动为人类和平的事业作出模样，成为捍卫世界和平的最坚强的堡垒。正因为这样，所以全世界正直的和爱好和平的人士都为苏联的每一成就而欢欣鼓舞。
    在全世界范围内，社会主义的事业也以澎湃之势向前发展。现在从欧洲到亚洲都已经出现了许多社会主义国家，并且组成了一个团结友好的社会主义大家庭。社会主义思想在一切国家的工人、农民和知识分子中显示出了越来越大的吸引力量，越来越深入人心。在十月革命的影响下，反对殖民主义的运动蓬勃地发展起来，特别是第二次世界大战以后，更加有力地冲击着摇摇欲坠的殖民主义体系。很显然，今天的国际形势已发生了根本的变化，帝国主义如果还想为保持其殖民统治而疯狂地发动战争，它的结果一定会遭到失败。
    我们中国人民尤其深深感激伟大的十月革命和我们的盟友苏联。我们每一个人都知道，中国人民革命是在十月革命的影响下发展起来的。毛泽东同志讲过：“十月革命一声炮响，给我们送来了马克思列宁主义”，十月革命指出了我们斗争的方向和道路，鼓舞了我们革命的人民，而在几次国内革命战争和抗日战争时期，苏联人民都向我国人民伸出了同情和支援的手。中华人民共和国成立后，苏联从各方面帮助我们恢复国民经济。接着，在我国开始了有计划的经济建设，苏联又给了我们更多的、更巨大的援助。因此，我们革命的胜利以及我们建设的成就都是和苏联的帮助分不开的。
    中国人民在长期的革命斗争中得到了许多有益的经验，而其中极其重要的一个就是：必须加强同苏联的友好团结，巩固和发展同苏联的伟大友谊。同苏联的友好、团结和合作过去是，现在是，而且永远是我们战无不胜的旗帜。因此，我们必须根据无产阶级国际主义和平等互助的原则，不遗余力地加强同苏联的友好团结以及同一切社会主义国家的友好团结。特别是今天，当一方面和平、民主和社会主义的事业正在以无可阻挡之势向前发展，而另一方面帝国主义的反动势力却千方百计想使人类陷入另一次战争以及扼杀人民力量的时候，加强这种团结就具有更加重大的意义！
    让我们在十月革命的光照之下，更为加强中苏两国的伟大友好团结而奋斗，更为加强社会主义各国的伟大团结而奋斗！
    伟大的十月社会主义革命万岁！
    中苏两大国人民的永久的、牢不可破的友谊万岁！
