Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, 27th. Construction workers in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have found ways to save a large amount of building materials for the country.

The employees of the Second Engineering Company of the Inner Mongolia Urban Construction Bureau have so far created and promoted more than 20 advanced experiences in saving building materials, such as hollow floor slabs, using lime tiles instead of cement tiles, and using bamboo pipes instead of cast iron for upper and lower water pipes. This has not only saved a large number of building materials, but also ensured the quality of the projects. In the first ten months of this year, the Inner Mongolia Directly Subordinate Engineering Company reduced cost expenses by 2.76 million yuan. This money is enough to build more than 16,500 square meters of building area. Workers in four construction units in Baotou City have saved 362 tons of steel, 4,330 tons of cement, and more than 1,700 tons of wood by using local materials and new technologies. After learning to use the new technology of prestressed reinforced concrete components, the Baotou Branch of Anshan Metallurgical Construction Company can save 20% to 70% of steel while ensuring quality.

The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region also organized manpower to collect scrap iron and steel in various parts of the autonomous region. This year, a total of 1,121 tons of steel bars, steel pipes, steel frames, and rails, and more than 500 tons of scrap iron and steel were excavated and cleaned up. At present, these steels have been used in production and basic construction. 60% of the steel materials used in basic construction projects in Hohhot this year are accumulated and abandoned steel materials from the past.

    内蒙古基本建设单位节省大量建筑材料
    新华社呼和浩特27日电　内蒙古自治区的建筑工人想办法为国家节省了大量建筑器材。
    内蒙古城市建设局第二工程公司职工，到目前为止已经创造和推行了空心楼板、以白灰瓦代替水泥瓦和用竹管代替铸铁做上、下水管道等二十多种节约建筑器材的先进经验，不仅节约了大批建筑材料，并且可以保证工程质量。内蒙古直属工程公司在今年头十个月的施工中，降低成本费用达二百七十六万元，用这些钱足可以再新建一万六千五百多平方公尺建筑面积的建筑物。包头市有四个建筑单位的工人，用就地取材、采用新技术等办法，节省了钢材三百六十二吨，水泥四千三百三十多吨，木材一千七百多吨。鞍山冶金建筑公司包头分公司学会了使用预应力钢筋混凝土构件的新技术以后，在保证质量的情况下，可以节省钢材20％到70％。
    内蒙古自治区还组织人力在自治区各地收集废钢铁。今年，全区挖掘清理出的钢筋、钢管、钢架、道轨等共有一千一百二十一吨，废钢铁五百多吨。目前这些钢铁都已经使用到生产和基本建设上。呼和浩特市今年基本建设工程中所用的钢铁器材，有60％是过去积压和遗弃的钢材。
