In Memory of Mr. Sun Yat-sen
Guo Moruo

I. His alias "Takano" spread fame rivaling Yu the Great's achievements; in youth, aspirations were tied to this man. He was a pioneer with foresight, reforming governance and celebrating the overthrow of the Qin. He happily heard of the forthcoming regulation of capital, and earnestly hoped for the equalization of land rights. Who would have foreseen the subversion of these three policies? How foolishly the obstinate ones misled the nation.

II. "Peace, struggle, save China!" The mournful cry is unbearable to hear. Beware of the enemy's softening tactics; would you rather see China carved up like a melon? A hundred words of his will sink into the vast sea, a flag of surrender flies to the enemy's army. The nation is in danger, lessons from past dynasties are forgotten. On Keelung Mountain, the evil spirits are still locked away.

III. The high wind clears, the wild geese call, gazing afar towards Taiwan and Penghu, entrusting messages to their wings. The unequal treaties shattered the chains, the model remains, his heart poured out. Why willingly be a puppet of the Stars and Stripes? Better to return and complete the great integrity. Today, the Western Hills are beautiful in autumn, deep blue clouds protect his crystal coffin.

IV. Cherish the Three Principles of the People, the red flags with five stars fly all over China.
  Those who till the land will have enough to eat,
  The propertyless laborers will rejoice everywhere.
  Converging naturally with Marxism-Leninism,
  His merits surpass Washington.
  Again, I read "The Book of Rites: Li Yun" in the wind,
  Paying homage from afar in Nanjing, offering a flower.

* In his early years, Mr. Sun Yat-sen, while living in Japan, used the alias "Takano".
* Taiwan formerly had the name Keelung Mountain.
* The crystal coffin prepared for Mr. Sun Yat-sen after his death was transported from the Soviet Union but was never used. It is now displayed in the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall at the Biyun Temple in the Western Hills.
* Mr. Sun Yat-sen once hand-wrote a passage from "The Book of Rites: Li Yun", "When the Great Way prevails, all under heaven will work for the common good," reflecting his vision for a future world of Great Harmony.

    纪念孙中山先生
    郭沫若
    其一高野声名传禹绩，?少年憧憬系斯人。先知先觉开先路，改玉改行庆改秦。资本喜闻将节制，地权切望待平均。谁期三策遭颠复，蠢彼嚣顽误国民。
    其二和平奋斗救中国，沉痛呼声不忍闻。提防敌人来软化，宁教赤县受瓜分？百言遗嘱沉苍海，一片降旗赴寇军。社稷险教深屋复，鸡笼犹自锁妖氛。?
    其三天高风净雁声还，远望台澎托羽翰。条约不平摧锁链，典型犹在沥胸肝。何为甘作花旗虏？好自归来大节完，此日西山秋正好，碧云深护水晶棺。?
    其四珍重三民精义在，五星赤帜遍中华。
  有田耕者家家足，
  无产劳工处处嘉。
  合辙自然符马列，
  论功当得轶华拿。
  重将礼运临风读，?
  遥拜金陵献一花。
    ?中山先生早年寄寓日本时，曾托名“高野”。
    ?台湾旧有鸡笼山之名。
    ?中山先生逝世后所备水晶棺，由苏联运来，未及用。今陈列西山碧云寺中山纪念堂内。
    ?中山先生尝手书礼运篇“大道之行天下为公”一段，乃对未来大同世界之憧憬。
