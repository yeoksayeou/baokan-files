    “Nagging Old Woman”
    Liu Heng
    Not long after I was transferred to the Baotou branch of the Anshan Metallurgical Chemical Construction Company as a worker, our foreman told me: “The Soviet expert Maslyayev is really good, after all, he was sent by a socialist country! He is knowledgeable, has good ideology, works patiently, can endure hardship, and loves to go to the construction site. But there is one thing, he is a nagging old woman.”
    What exactly was this about? Our foreman wouldn’t tell me.
    That day, we were digging earthwork and carrying dirt baskets at the construction site. When I looked up, I saw a group of people looking at us, and one of them was a Soviet. The guy next to me, Little Li (who came eight months earlier than me), told me: “Look! That's the expert Maslyayev.” I asked: “What about those guys in serge uniforms?” He said: “They are the responsible comrades of our branch. I recognize a few, but there are others—they rarely come to the construction site, so I don't know who they are.”
    While we were talking, that group of people had already turned around and surrounded our foreman. I also quickly surrounded them, wanting to hear what the "nagging old woman" had to say.
    The expert said: “Hey, haven't I told you several times? You should find ways to reduce the workers' physical labor; you shouldn’t always make the workers carry dirt baskets. With the death of old China and the growth of new China, the construction tools should also be slowly replaced with new ones. As a foreman, you should pay attention to whether the workers have smiles on their faces when they are working, because labor is pleasant. If the workers don't have smiles on their faces, it means they are working too hard!”
    The foreman said: “We are already thinking of ways to reduce the workers' physical labor. The branch is preparing to buy several excavators and earth-moving machines.”
    “You don't have to wait for the excavators and earth-moving machines! Because first of all, you don't know when they will arrive, and secondly, even if they arrive, they may not be enough. Haven't I told you several times? I really don't understand why you still leave dozens of pushcarts idle in the warehouse, gathering mold, and refuse to take them out to use! A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. Our Soviet mechanization also came step by step. You don't have to wait specifically for large machinery.”
    “If we all use small carts to move earth, I'm afraid we'll have to add another foreman…”
    “Yes, the simpler the tools the workers use, the more convenient the management work is. The more complex the tools the workers use, the more troublesome the management work is. When the workers are carrying dirt baskets with shoulder poles, the foreman watches by the side, which takes almost no effort. What if the workers use small carts? The foreman has to pay attention to construction organization, assembly line operations, and so on, and the art of leadership becomes more sophisticated. We leaders can't just try to save ourselves trouble and let the workers suffer. I think, if the dirt basket were carried on your shoulders, your opinion would probably be different.”
    Oh! Now I understand everything—
    Why does our foreman say that Maslyayev is a "nagging old woman"? Because he himself does not properly implement the expert's recommendations. The expert can't help it, he says it every time he comes. And then he says it again the next time he comes.
    Why doesn't our foreman properly implement the expert's recommendations? Because if the burden on our workers' shoulders is lighter, the burden on our foreman's shoulders will be heavier! —This is also an important reason why we workers welcome advanced experience and inventions, while some administrative managers often do not love advanced experience and inventions.

    “婆婆嘴”
    刘衡
    我调到鞍山冶金化学建筑工程公司包头分公司当工人不久，咱们的工长告诉我：“苏联专家马斯良耶夫可好咧，到底是社会主义国家派来的人！人有学问，思想又好，工作耐心，又能吃苦，还爱下工地。可是就有一桩，他是一个婆婆嘴。”
    这到底是怎么一回事？咱们的工长不肯对我说。
    那天，咱们正在工地上挖土方、挑土筐子。我一抬头，看见有一群人正对着咱们看，这群人当中有个是苏联人。在我旁边跟我一块挖土的小李（他比我早来八个月）告诉我：“看！那个就是马斯良耶夫专家。”我问：“旁边那几个穿呢子制服的呢？”他说：“那是咱们分公司的负责同志。有几个我倒认识，还有几个——他们很少下工地，咱也不认得他们谁是谁。”
    咱俩正说着话，那一群人已经转过身，把咱们的工长围起来了。我也赶紧围上去，想听听“婆婆嘴”说些什么。
    专家说：“唉，我不是对你说过好几次啦吗？你应该想办法减轻工人的体力劳动，不应该让工人老挑土筐子。随着旧中国的死亡，新中国的成长，在施工工具上，也应该用新的慢慢来代替旧的。当工长的应该注意工人劳动的时候，脸上有没有笑容，因为劳动是愉快的。如果工人脸上没有笑容，那就是他们工作太累了！”
    工长说：“我们已经在想办法减轻工人的体力劳动，分公司准备买几部挖土机、运土机。”
    “你们不必去等挖土机、运土机啦！因为一来不知它们什么时候能够运来，二来就是运来了，也不一定够用。我不是对你说过好几次吗？我真不懂你为什么还要把几十辆推土小车闲在库房里长霉，不肯拿出来用！小鸟拿到手上总比老鹰飞在天上好，咱们苏联的机械化也是一步一步走来的，不必专门去等大机械。”
    “如果咱们都用小车推土，恐怕得另外添一个工长……”
    “是的，工人用的工具越简单，管理工作就越方便。工人用的工具越复杂，管理工作就越麻烦。工人们用扁担挑土筐的时候，工长在旁边看着，几乎不费什么劲。如果工人们用小车呢？工长就要注意施工组织、流水作业等等，领导艺术就高明了。咱们当领导的不能光图自己省事，让工人吃苦。我想，如果土筐是挑在你的肩上，恐怕你的看法就会不一样了。”
    噢！这一下子我全部明白过来了——
    为什么咱们的工长说马斯良耶夫是“婆婆嘴”呢？因为他自己不好好执行专家的建议。专家忍不住，来一次，就讲一次。再来一次，又讲一次。
    为什么咱们的工长不好好执行专家的建议呢？因为咱们工人肩上的担子轻了，咱们工长肩上的担子就重啦！——这也就是为什么咱们当工人的都欢迎先进经验、发明创造，而有一些行政管理人员常常不爱先进经验、发明创造的一个重要原因。
