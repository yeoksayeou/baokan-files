    Extracting Sulfur from Slag Skin
    (Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 28th) The Xiabaishang and Beixiangtai Sulfur Production Cooperatives in Yangcheng County, Shanxi Province, have recently created an experience in extracting sulfur from slag skin, finding a new way to increase production.
    In the past, the Xiabaishang and Beixiangtai Sulfur Cooperatives discarded the outer layer of the ore (mixed with impurities). In March of this year, when Soviet experts came here for inspection, they proposed the suggestion of "high-temperature sulfur smelting." Jin Jiuzhu, a member of the Beixiangtai Sulfur Cooperative, based on this suggestion and his years of sulfur smelting experience, added 30% slag skin to the furnace, increasing the furnace temperature and greatly improving the sulfur extraction rate. Later, when the Xiabaishang Sulfur Cooperative was promoting the Beixiangtai experience, member Du Dechang discovered that the slag skin contained a large amount of sulfur and, after many experiments, proved that four jin and fifteen liang of pure sulfur could be extracted from every hundred jin of slag skin.

    从渣皮中提取硫磺
    据新华社太原28日电　山西省阳城县的下白桑和北香台两个硫磺业生产合作社，最近创造出从渣皮中提取硫磺的经验，找出了增加生产的新途径。
    下白桑和北香台磺业社过去把矿石外沿包着的一层壳（夹着杂质）丢掉不用。今年3月，苏联专家到这里检查的时候，曾经提出了“高温炼磺”的建议。北香台磺业社社员靳揪住根据这个建议和自己多年炼磺的经验，在炉内加入30％的渣皮，提高了炉温，使提磺率大大提高。后来，下白桑磺业社在推行北香台经验的时候，社员杜德昌又发现渣皮中含有大量硫磺，并且经过多次实验，证明每百斤渣皮中能提炼出四斤十五两净磺。
