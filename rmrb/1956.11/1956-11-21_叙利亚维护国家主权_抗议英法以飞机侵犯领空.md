Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, November 20th: The Syrian government today submitted a memorandum to the diplomatic representatives in Damascus of all member states of the Security Council, protesting the violation of Syrian airspace by British, French, and Israeli aircraft.

On the same day, Syrian Representative to the United Nations, Mr. Yasa, delivered a letter to the President of the United Nations Security Council in New York, requesting him and all member states of the United Nations to pay attention to this issue. The letter stated: "The Syrian government strongly protests the violation of its airspace, which clearly demonstrates the intention of Britain, France, and Israel to continue their blatant aggression."

Meanwhile, Syrian Foreign Minister Salah al-Din Bitar told a press conference in Damascus that British, French, and Israeli military aircraft had flown over Syrian cities and airports in the past few days for the purpose of carrying out heinous aggression. This incident occurred despite the Syrian government's decision to close its airports and ban aircraft of all countries from flying over its airspace.

He condemned the three countries for undermining the terms of the ceasefire in the Middle East by flying and violating Syrian airspace. He said: "These acts constitute a serious violation of the United Nations Charter because they infringe upon Syria's sovereignty."

    叙利亚维护国家主权
    抗议英法以飞机侵犯领空
    新华社20日讯　大马士革消息：叙利亚政府今天把一份备忘录给所有安全理事会成员国的驻大马士革外交代表，抗议英国、法国和以色列的飞机侵犯叙利亚领空。
    同一天，叙利亚驻联合国代表亚沙在纽约交给联合国安全理事会主席一封信，要求他和所有联合国成员国注意这一问题。这封信说：“叙利亚政府强硬抗议侵犯它的领空，这种飞行清楚地表明了英国、法国和以色列继续进行明目张胆的侵略的意图。”
    同时，叙利亚外交部长塞拉哈丁·比塔尔在大马士革记者招待会上说，英国、法国和以色列军用飞机曾在过去几天中飞越叙利亚的城市和机场，其目的在进行罪恶的侵略。尽管叙利亚政府决定封闭它的机场和禁止所有国家的飞机飞越它的领空，还是发生了这种事件。
    他谴责这三个国家以这种侵犯叙利亚领空的飞行破坏了在中东停火的条款。他说：“这些行为构成对联合国宪章的严重破坏，因为它们侵犯了叙利亚的主权。”
