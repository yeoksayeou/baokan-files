Editorial Notes

    Don't Only Think About Small Groups
    It's good that some comrades who work on welfare in some units are very capable of planning for the lives and welfare of the staff in their own units. However, it's not good if they only care about the welfare of their own unit's staff and forget about, or even harm, the welfare of the masses outside their unit.
    Beijing's population has increased, and living standards have improved, so the supply of milk is strained. As a result, some welfare departments of government agencies and enterprises, in order to "guarantee" the milk needed by their staff, spare no expense in buying milk cows from private dairy farmers. People who originally ordered milk from private dairy farmers, children and patients, suddenly have no milk to drink.
    This approach will only create more tension and alienate the staff of these organizations from the masses. If the welfare departments of each unit adopt the same or similar methods for relatively scarce consumer goods, the consequences would be unimaginable! The staff of each unit probably wouldn't want to build their own "welfare" on the suffering of others, would they?

    不要只为小集体着想
    有些单位的做福利工作的同志，很能为本单位工作人员的生活福利作打算，这是很好的。可是，如果只顾本单位的人员的福利，却忘怀了以至妨害了本单位以外的群众的福利，那就不好了。
    北京人口增加了，而且生活水平提高了，牛奶的供应感到紧张了。于是，有些机关、企业的福利部门，为了使本单位工作人员需要的牛奶有“保证”，就不惜高价收买私营奶户的奶牛。原来在私营奶户那里订牛奶的人，小孩子和病人，突然没有牛奶喝了。
    这种作法，既会更多制造紧张，又会使本机关工作人员脱离群众。如果每个单位的福利工作部门对于比较缺乏的消费品都采取同样的或类似的手法，何堪设想！各单位的工作人员，未必愿意把自己的“福利”建筑在别人的痛苦上面吧？
