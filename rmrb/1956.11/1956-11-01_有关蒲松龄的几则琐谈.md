Some Anecdotes About Pu Songling

Six. The Collection of Pu Songling's Poems, Essays, and Folk Songs Currently Being Compiled and Edited

In the summer of 1953, Mr. Lu Dahuang handed over to the Shandong Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles a collection of Pu's posthumous works, including poems, essays, and folk songs, that he had collected over many years and also printed before the War of Resistance Against Japan. A copy of the manuscript was made in clear calligraphy. Because of some later discoveries, as well as differences in the entries, chronology, and other reasons, it needs to be recompiled and edited. However, that was only a preliminary copy made in preparation for careful sorting. Of course, any newly discovered and reliable posthumous works of Pu from various places should be added at any time. Now, the People's Literature Publishing House has agreed with Mr. Lu that within half a year, these posthumous works of Pu will be arranged, sorted, and edited to make them a more complete version. Mr. Lu originally wrote "A Chronological Biography of Pu Songling," but it still needs to be revised, with new materials added. It can also be completed during this period. This is just work in progress. Without the consent of the People's Literature Publishing House and Mr. Lu, I am mentioning it here briefly in order to tell the readers who care about Pu's posthumous works as soon as possible. I hope the People's Literature Publishing House and Mr. Lu will forgive me for "leaking the news"!

As for how many kinds of works Pu Songling has besides "Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio," and how many kinds are currently available in printed or manuscript form, it seems that no one can make a definite statement on this question yet, and we don't need to rush to "make a firm conclusion." Now we can only compile and publish those works that are definitely known to be his posthumous works, by category, for the reference of researchers and readers who love Pu's works. Some works are still in doubt, and for the time being, no real evidence can be found. We can only wait for later discoveries of new materials, precise proofs from researchers, and determine whether they are his. When Academician Průšek from Czechoslovakia came to Shandong this time, he told me that he insisted on a cautious attitude. For some works that are said to be Pu's, unless there is strong evidence to the contrary, it is best not to think that they are not Pu's works. We should wait until new evidence is available later to determine them.

Seven. Academician Průšek Visited Pu's Village

Academician Průšek has studied Chinese for many years and has translated many Chinese classical and modern literary works. He and Comrade Fass went to Jinan and made a special trip to Pu's Village to see Pu's former residence, several relics, and the writer's tomb and stone tablet. Academician Průšek has translated "Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio" and has also read Pu's other works. Therefore, he was very happy when I introduced Mr. Lu to him, because he had read Mr. Lu's articles about Pu Songling many years ago.

After Academician Průšek returned from Pu's Village, he talked about his personal visit to the writer's hometown to see his house and the conditions of the village. He had a deeper understanding of the fact that Pu Songling was born in a humble family and lived in a poor village. He also wanted to send the version of "Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio" that he translated to the memorial room in Pu's former residence.

The commentaries on Pu's works and the versions and manuscripts of "Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio" are being done by specialized researchers, and this "idle" talk should not involve them. Finally, I will quote three of Pu's poems as an ending.

Qingshi Pass

"Body in a jar, looking up at flying birds.
South Mountain, North Mountain clouds, thousands of trees.
Only see people in the mountains, but not the road in the mountains,
Woodcutters point with branches, grabbing vines from here.
Curved path ascends to the clouds, horses have no steady footing.
Suddenly hear dogs barking, a few families gather with smoke and fire.
Reining in, look back to where we came from, vast misty green.

The above poem is the first in the "Collection of Poems from the Studio," and "Southern Travels" also starts with this poem. Qingshi Pass is in the mountains of Laiwu County, Shandong, and it was a necessary passage to the south in those years. The mountains are high and the paths are narrow, and it has always been a strategic point in wars. This is the first poem Pu Songling wrote when he went to Bao'ying County to work as a secretary, starting from his hometown. He was thirty-one years old that year.

The next one is a work he wrote not long after returning north, named "Famine Victims' Ballad": "Rain does not fall, autumn has no harvest. No harvest is okay, but what about the taxes! Officials come to the door, angry and scolding, rather sell children, to avoid trouble. Even if it doesn't rain, death is nothing, don't sue in the court to the officials!"

Another poem is:

Rhyming in Response to Sir Wang Ruan Ting's Kind Gift

"The book of strange tales is finished, everyone laughs at it, dressed in cloth robes, desolate, with temples like silk. In ten years, I have gained the meaning of Huangzhou, cold rain, cold lamp, when talking at night."

This one came much later, about ten years after his southern tour, and he was in his forties. The first draft of "Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio" had been completed. Although there were later revisions and the addition of works from his old age, the entire general writing was done at this time. He used the words "rhyming in response" precisely to respond to the seven-character quatrain that Wang Yuyang (Wang Ruan Ting's alias was Yuyang, a Shandong native) wrote for him, titled "Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio," which is:

"Just say it casually, just listen to it casually, rain drizzling on bean trellises and melon sheds. It should be tiring to be human language, love to listen to ghosts singing poems from autumn tombs."

From the sentence "In ten years, I have gained the meaning of Huangzhou," it can be further known that the entire manuscript of "Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio" was completed approximately during his thirties to forties. Although there were later additions, they were very limited.

(The ages of Pu Songling mentioned in the article are based on Mr. Lu Dahuang's old work "A Chronological Biography of Mr. Pu Liouquan.")

    有关蒲松龄的几则琐谈
    王统照
    六、正在编订中的蒲松龄的诗、文、俚曲集
    1953年夏天，经路大荒先生把多年搜集也曾在抗战前印行过的蒲氏遗著中的诗、文和俚曲集交山东省文联，清钞出一份底本。因为有些后来发现的资料以及篇目不同，时间先后等种种原因，须重行编订。但那只是个先钞出准备好好整理的底本，当然，各地如有新发现而可靠的蒲氏遗著自应随时增入。现在人民文学出版社已与路先生约定，期以半年的工夫把这些蒲氏的遗著排比、整订，使可成为比较完善的本子。路先生原有“蒲松龄年谱”之作，但仍须重行改订，增加新的材料，将来也可在此期间写好。这只是初在进行中的工作，没得到人民文学出版社和路先生的同意，我在此约略提到，为了对蒲氏遗著关心的读者早说一句，望人民文学出版社和路先生原谅我“透漏消息”！
    至于蒲松龄的作品除“聊斋志异”外，究竟有多少种，现在有印本或钞本的有多少种，这个问题似乎还没人能够下一句肯定的断语，我们也正不必急着“一口咬定”。现在只好据确已知道是他的遗作的，比类编订，印行传播，以供研究与爱读蒲氏作品者的参考。有些作品还在疑似之间，一时又找不出真凭实据，只好先等一等，后来或有新材料的发现，研究者的精密证明，断定是否。这次捷克斯洛伐克的普实克院士到山东来，同我谈及，他力持慎重态度，对于某些作品相传是蒲氏作的，如无有力的反证，最好先不要认为即非蒲氏作品，应当待到后来有了新证，才能断定。
    七、普实克院士曾往蒲家庄游览
    普实克院士研究汉语多年，曾译过不少的中国古典文学作品和新文学作品。他与发斯同志到济南来，特地去了一趟蒲家庄，看过蒲氏的故居，几件遗物和这位作家的坟茔、石碑。普实克院士译过“聊斋志异”，也读过蒲氏的其他著作。所以，我介绍路先生与他时，他很高兴，因为好些年前，他就看过路先生写的有关蒲松龄的文章了。
    普实克院士从蒲家庄回来后，谈及他这次亲身到了这位作家的故乡看他的房子和乡村的情况，对于蒲松龄当年是出身寒素，居住穷乡，更有深切的了解。他还要把他译的“聊斋志异”本子寄到蒲氏故居的纪念室内。
    关于蒲氏著作的评论以及“聊斋志异”的版本、钞本等，都有专门研究者来作这些工作，这篇近乎“闲”谈的文中不应涉及。末后，引录蒲氏的三首诗作为结束。
    青石关
    “身在瓮盎中，仰看飞鸟度。
    南山北山云，千株万株树。
    但见山中人，不见山中路，
    樵者指以柯，扪萝自兹去。
    勾曲上层霄，马蹄无稳步。
    忽然闻犬吠，烟火数家聚。
    挽辔眺来处，茫茫积翠雾。
    上诗是“聊斋诗集”中的第一首，“南游草”同样以这首居首。青石关在山东的莱芜县山中，是当年由这一带往南去的必经之路。山高径窄，也是向来战争的要隘。这是蒲松龄往宝应县去作幕，由故乡启行作的第一首诗。这年他正三十一岁。
    下一首是他北归后不多年的作品，名灾民谣雨不落，秋无禾，无禾犹可，征输奈何！吏到门，怒且呵，宁鬻子，免风波。纵不雨，死无他，勿诉公堂长官呵！
    另一首是：
    次韵答王司寇阮亭先生见赠
    志异书成共笑之，布袍萧索鬓如丝。十年颇得黄州意，冷雨寒灯夜话时。
    这一首晚得多了，大约距他南游时有十年左右，他的年龄也在四十岁上。“聊斋志异”已经完成初稿。虽然后来还有修订以及把老年时的作品加入，而全部的大致写成却在此时。他用“次韵”二字，正是为了酬答王渔洋（王阮亭别号渔洋山东人）为他题“聊斋志异”的那首七绝，即
    姑妄言之姑听之，豆棚瓜架雨丝丝。料应厌作人间语，爱听秋坟鬼唱诗。
    从“十年颇得黄州意”句中，更可知道“聊斋志异”全稿，约成于他的三十岁到四十岁的期间，以后虽有增益的篇目，却很有限了。
  （文中有关蒲松龄年岁的地方都以路大荒先生旧作“蒲柳泉先生年谱”为准。）
