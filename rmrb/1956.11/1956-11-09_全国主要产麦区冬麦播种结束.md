Xinhua News Agency, 7th: The winter wheat sowing work in major wheat-producing areas across the country, including Henan, Shandong, Hebei, Shaanxi, and Shanxi provinces, has concluded. In the southern provinces, the sowing work has generally completed about 50% of the planned area, with some faster areas reaching 70% to 80%.

The winter wheat sowing work in many areas was carried out after overcoming severe water and drought disasters. Hebei, Jiangsu, Anhui, and other provinces suffered flooding due to continuous heavy rains brought by strong typhoons, which submerged large areas of farmland. To reduce disaster losses and ensure timely sowing, farmers in the affected areas, in addition to actively salvaging mature crops and taking measures such as washing seedlings, supporting seedlings, replanting, and applying top dressing to save the submerged autumn crops, also urgently mobilized and organized forces to carry out drainage work in a planned manner. After one to two months of intensive efforts in Hebei Province, over 36 million mu of flooded farmland (80% of the submerged area) have been drained, and the current wheat planting area in the province has reached over 37 million mu, exceeding the planned sowing area by more than 10%. In the dryland areas of Jiangsu Province, the sowing work on over 18 million mu of early-stubble land has also been basically completed before "Frost's Descent" due to the adoption of drainage and planting measures, such as draining one plot and planting one plot.

Some areas in Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Guangxi, and other provinces experienced drought before the autumn sowing and winter planting. They are currently continuing to carry out mass drought resistance and emergency planting work and have achieved great results.

Before the winter wheat sowing, various localities also carried out work such as plowing the land, increasing fertilizer accumulation, replacing with improved seeds, seed germination tests, and seed dressing with pesticides. The agricultural departments of Zhejiang Province held a meeting in late August to study and arrange winter planting plans and the promotion of advanced techniques for winter sowing work and trained more than 50,000 winter crop technicians. Ten counties in Henan Province, including Shangqiu, Zhecheng, and Taikang, also formulated wheat yield increase plans and technical operating procedures, and many agricultural cooperatives also formulated detailed wheat planting plans. Counties in the Yan'an Special Zone of Shaanxi Province also established wheat sowing headquarters, formulated key points for wheat cultivation techniques, and widely launched mass technical training work.

Currently, the early-sown wheat in the northern provinces has mostly emerged, and the growth is generally very good. Agricultural cooperatives in various localities are continuing to carry out seedling checking, seedling replanting, and applying additional fertilizer.

### 全国主要产麦区冬麦播种结束

    全国主要产麦区冬麦播种结束
    新华社7日讯　全国主要产麦地区河南、山东、河北、陕西和山西等省的冬小麦播种工作已经结束；南方各省的播种工作一般也都完成了播种计划的50％左右，进度较快的已达到70％到80％。
    许多地区的冬小麦播种工作，是在战胜了严重的水、旱灾害情况下进行的。河北、江苏、安徽等省因强大台风袭击而带来的连续暴雨造成水灾，使大片田地被淹。为了减少灾害损失和保证适时播种，受灾地区的农民除积极抢救已成熟的作物和采取洗苗、扶苗、补种追肥等措施挽救被淹的大秋作物外，并紧急动员、组织力量，有计划地进行排水工作。河北省经过一、两个月来的紧张突击，全省排除积水的田地已达三千六百多万亩（占被淹面积80％），而全省目前的种麦面积已达到三千七百多万亩，超过了计划播种面积的10％以上。江苏省旱谷地区的一千八百多万亩早茬地的播种工作，也由于采取了排一块、种一块等排涝抢种措施，因此也已在“霜降”前基本结束。
    河南、湖北、湖南、广西等省的部分地区在秋播冬种前相继发生旱情，现正继续开展群众性的抗旱抢种工作，并且已经取得了很大成绩。
    各地在冬麦播种以前，还进行了翻耕土地、增积肥料、调换良种、种子发芽试验和药剂拌种等工作。浙江省农业部门在8月下旬就举行会议对冬种规划和推广冬季播种工作的先进技术进行研究和布置，并且训练了五万多名冬作技术员。河南省商丘、柘城、太康等十个县还制定了小麦增产方案和技术操作规程，许多农业社还订了详细的种麦计划。陕西省延安专区各县还成立了小麦播种指挥部，制定小麦栽培技术要点，并且广泛展开群众性的技术传授工作。
    现在，北方各省早播的小麦，大都已经出苗，生长一般都很好。各地的农业社正在继续进行查苗补苗和增施追肥等工作。
