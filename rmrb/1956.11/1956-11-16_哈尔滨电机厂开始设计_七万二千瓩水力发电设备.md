Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, November 15th. Under the guidance of Soviet experts, the Harbin Electric Machinery Factory is designing 72,000-kilowatt hydroelectric generating equipment for newly built hydroelectric power stations in China. The design of this large hydroelectric generating equipment marks a rapid improvement in China's technical level in designing hydro-turbine generators.

Designing hydro-turbine generator sets is a relatively complex task. It differs from thermal power equipment, which can be imitated based on readily available data. Since it uses the hydraulic force of water to drive a turbine, which in turn drives the generator to generate electricity, its structure must be adapted to the water flow velocity, head height, and other natural conditions of different hydroelectric power stations. Therefore, hydro-turbine generator sets can only be designed independently with reference to foreign data and based on specific circumstances.

In August 1953, the Harbin Electric Machinery Factory began designing a 10,000-kilowatt hydro-turbine generator set. This was a leap forward for the Harbin Electric Machinery Factory from designing small and medium-sized motors to designing large motors. At that time, there were no reference materials for the design, so the factory organized designers to collect data from relevant hydroelectric power stations in China. They studied the structure and automation equipment of large units, made on-site surveys and mapping, and borrowed installation drawings for design reference. During the design of the unit's automation and automatic adjustment excitation device, they received strong assistance from Soviet experts and the motor research departments of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Because the designers sought advice from many sources, the problems encountered were solved, and the design was finally successful. Through the design work of the 10,000-kilowatt hydro-turbine generator set, the factory's designers accumulated rich experience, enabling them to start designing even larger hydro-generators.

    哈尔滨电机厂开始设计
    七万二千瓩水力发电设备
    新华社哈尔滨15日电　哈尔滨电机厂正在苏联专家指导下，为国内新建水电站设计七万二千瓩的水力发电设备。这种巨大水力发电设备的设计，标志着我国在设计水轮发电机方面技术水平的迅速提高。
    设计水轮发电机组是一项较为复杂的工作。它不同于火力发电设备可以根据现成资料来仿制。由于它是利用水力冲动水轮机带动水轮发电机发电，它的结构必须适合不同的水电站的水流流速、水头高低，以及其它自然条件。因此，水轮发电机组只能参考国外资料并且根据具体情况自行设计。
    1953年8月，哈尔滨电机厂开始设计一万瓩的水轮发电机组。这是哈尔滨电机厂由设计小、中型电机到设计大型电机的一个跃进阶段。那时，设计没有参考资料，这个厂就组织设计人员到国内有关水电站收集资料。他们研究了大型机组的结构和自动化设备，作了实地测绘，并且借到了安装图纸，作为设计参考。在设计机组的自动化设计和自动调整励磁装置的时候，曾经得到了苏联专家和中国科学院电机研究部门的有力帮助。由于设计人员多方面请教，因此遇到的问题都得到了解决，终于设计成功。经过一万瓩水轮发电机组的设计工作，这个厂的设计人员积累了丰富的经验，从而能够开始进行更大的水轮发电机的设计。
