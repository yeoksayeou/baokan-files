Xinhua News Agency, November 14th, New York dispatch: United Nations Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjöld wrote to Israeli Foreign Minister Golda Meir on November 11th, demanding negotiations on the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Egypt.

Hammarskjöld pointed out that the Israeli government had announced that it was willing to withdraw its troops from Egypt immediately based on "satisfactory" arrangements with the United Nations regarding the International Emergency Force. However, the Israeli government has never stated what arrangements are "necessary."

Hammarskjöld requested that Meir quickly inform him of the Israeli government's views so that further discussions could be held on the arrangements for the International Emergency Force, enabling the fulfillment of Israel's promise to withdraw its troops from Egypt.

Xinhua News Agency, November 14th, Cairo dispatch: A United Nations observer group arrived in the Port Said war zone on November 13th to inspect the ceasefire situation.

The personnel of this observer group traveled from Haifa on a British landing craft and disembarked at Port Said. After meeting with Lieutenant General Stockwell, commander of the British-French task force, they traveled by car to Kap, near Port Said, which is located on the current ceasefire line between the British-French forces and Egypt.

The observer group consists of thirteen people, including officials from Norway, Sweden, Denmark, and Australia. A French official in the group remained in Port Said as a liaison officer to the British-French forces and did not go to the ceasefire line.
