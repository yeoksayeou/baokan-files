Xinhua News Agency, 11th - TASS reported on the 10th: Representatives of the Soviet Peace Movement and foreign peace delegations visiting Moscow held a get-together on the 9th. Peace delegations from the following countries attended: India, Japan, Sudan, Yugoslavia, Greece, Finland, West Germany, and East Germany. The hall was also filled with workers from Moscow factories, cultural figures, and prominent scientists.

    Nikolai Tikhonov, Chairman of the Soviet Peace Committee, said at the meeting: We are now facing a worrying situation. Egypt is bleeding. The aggression by Britain, France, and Israel is a threat to world peace. In our time, no political leader can deny the influence of the people and organized peace movements on the international situation. The UN General Assembly expressed their will, demanding a ceasefire and the withdrawal of aggressor troops from Egypt. But this decision has not yet been fulfilled. We must vigilantly pay attention to further developments in order to rule out the possibility of a third world war.

    India's B. V. Pradhan said that all the Indian people condemn the aggression by Britain, France, and Israel. The purpose of the aggression is clear to everyone—that is, to re-establish the previous colonial regime in the Near East. The people of Britain and France must make their governments stop this infamous attempt!

    T. Arold spoke on behalf of peace fighters from West Germany and East Germany. She emphasized that the actions of Britain, France, and Israel in violation of international law are a real threat to peace. The peace movement is a powerful force that will help defeat the aggressors.

    Mohammad Jabari, a representative of the International Confederation of Arab Trade Unions, delivered a long and passionate speech. He said that ninety million Arabs are engaged in a heroic struggle for their independence. Britain, France, and Israel launched a criminal aggression against Egypt. However, as Nasser pointed out, Arabs are prepared to die for their freedom. I ask you to help us in this difficult and noble struggle. Stop this criminal aggression!

    Jozé, a representative of Yugoslav peace fighters, expressed opposition to aggression and said that, at this critical moment, the United Nations must take more resolute action.

    The gathering unanimously adopted a joint statement at the end. The statement said: The people of all countries unanimously condemn this action that violates peace and is fraught with the danger of causing a full-scale conflict. The United Nations has passed a resolution stipulating a ceasefire and the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Egypt. We support this resolution and demand that all foreign troops withdraw from Egypt after the cessation of hostilities. We call on all peace fighters around the world to firmly condemn the use of force and to lead governments to pursue peaceful negotiations in resolving the Suez conflict.

    许多国家和平战士在莫斯科集会
    一致支持联合国决议要侵略军撤出埃及
    新华社11日讯　据塔斯社10日报道：苏联和平运动的代表同正在莫斯科访问的外国和平代表团在9日举行了一个联欢会。出席的有下列国家的和平代表团：印度、日本、苏丹、南斯拉夫、希腊、芬兰、西德和民主德国。联欢会大厅里还挤满了莫斯科工厂的工人、文化界人士和著名的科学家。
    苏联保卫和平委员会主席吉洪诺夫在会上说：我们现在面临着一个令人忧虑的局势。埃及正在流血。英、法和以色列的侵略对世界和平是一个威胁。在我们的时代，没有一个政治领袖能够否认人民和有组织的和平运动对国际局势所起的影响。联合国大会表达了他们的意志，要求停火以及侵略军队撤出埃及。但是这个决定到目前为止还没有得到履行。我们必须警惕地注意事件的进一步的发展以便排除第三次世界大战的可能性。
    印度的巴·维·普拉丹说，全体印度人民谴责英、法和以色列的侵略。侵略的目的是人人都清楚的——那就是在近东重新建立以前的殖民政权。英国和法国人民必须使他们的政府停止这个臭名远扬的企图！
    提·阿罗耳德代表西德和民主德国的和平战士发言。她强调说，英国、法国和以色列的违反国际法的行动是对和平的一个真正的威胁。和平运动是一支强大的力量，它会帮助打败侵略者。
    阿拉伯工会国际联合会代表穆罕默德·贾巴里发表了长篇热情的讲话。他说，九千万阿拉伯人正在为他们的独立进行着英勇的斗争。英国、法国和以色列向埃及发动了罪恶的侵略。然而，正如纳赛尔所指出的那样，阿拉伯人准备为他们的自由而死。我要求你们在这个困难而崇高的斗争中帮助我们。制止这种罪恶的侵略！
    南斯拉夫和平战士代表约泽在讲话中表示反对侵略，并且说，在这个紧要的时候，联合国必须采取更坚决的行动。
    联欢会最后一致通过了一项联合声明。声明说：各国人民一致谴责这种充满了可能引起全面冲突危险的违反和平的行动。联合国通过了一项决议规定停火和一切外国军队撤出埃及。我们支持这项决议，并且要求在敌对行动结束后一切外国军队撤出埃及，我们呼吁全世界所有和平战士坚决地谴责使用武力，并且使各国政府在解决苏伊士冲突问题上走和平谈判的道路。
