Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, November 19th: Wuhan has unified the dispatch of intra-city transportation vehicles, ensuring that transportation on the main traffic lines is not congested due to a failure of intra-city transfers. Since the beginning of this year, although railway transportation has been much busier than in previous years, no station has experienced cargo congestion. Even in the Hankou Xunlimen Station, which has the narrowest freight yard and the busiest freight traffic, more than 99% of the goods transported by train in October this year were able to be transported away from the station ahead of schedule or on time, as stipulated.

Wuhan is a hub of water and land transportation. In the past, intra-city transportation units such as automobiles, ships, and stevedores all acted independently, resulting in congestion at three of Wuhan's six freight stations. In June last year, Wuhan established a general transportation dispatching office to uniformly direct various intra-city transportation units. At the same time, it stipulated that the departments responsible for the main traffic lines should notify the general dispatching office and the consignors in advance every day of the goods to be transported, and the consignors should apply to the general dispatching office for transshipment within one hour after receiving the notification. The general dispatching office then promptly and reasonably arranges various intra-city transportation resources based on these reports.

    武汉市内运输已不堵塞
    据新华社武汉19日电　武汉市统一调度市内运输工具，保证了交通干线的运输不因市内接运不及发生堵塞。今年以来，虽然铁路运输比往年繁忙得多，却没有一个车站发生货物拥塞现象。即使在货场最窄小、货运最繁忙的汉口循礼门车站内，今年10月份由火车运来的货物中也有99％以上能按规定时间提前或准时运离车站。
    武汉市是水陆交通枢纽。过去市内汽车、轮船、搬运等运输单位都各自为政，因而在武汉市的六个货运车站中就有三个经常发生堵塞现象。去年6月份，武汉市成立了运输总调度室，统一指挥市内各个运输单位。同时规定交通干线的负责部门每天事先将要运到的货物通知总调度室和货主，货主在接到通知以后的一小时内向总调度室申请转运。总调度室每天就根据这些报告及时统一合理地安排市内各种运输力量。
