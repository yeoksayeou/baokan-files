    A Stroll Through Dresden
    Zhang Pei
    Anyone who has traveled to the German Democratic Republic always has an unforgettable impression of Dresden on the Elbe River. When Germany was still divided by feudalism in the 18th century and not yet a unified country, Dresden was the capital of the Kingdom of Saxony. Many palaces here were built during the Kingdom of Saxony era, along with famous ancient buildings such as the Court Church and the Royal Library. Each ancient building is decorated with various exquisite reliefs and murals. Later, Dresden developed into the center of Germany's optical industry, with the main part of the famous Zeiss factory located here. Dresden is situated by mountains and water, with greenery throughout the city, making it a very beautiful city in Germany. Before the war, Dresden had a population of over 600,000.
    On February 13, 1945, the vanguard of the Soviet army was only a few kilometers away from Dresden. The Hitler bandits had already begun to flee westward. It seemed that Dresden was about to return to the embrace of the people. However, on that very night, American generals sent hundreds of bombers and almost destroyed the city overnight, killing more than 30,000 ordinary Germans.
    This was a despicable conspiracy that even a child could see through...
    One afternoon in late July, we traveled by car from Karl Marx City to Dresden.
    After the car entered the city, I attentively looked out the window, wanting to see the extent to which this destroyed city had been restored. We were all very happy because almost all the houses alongside the long green streets lined with linden and oak trees had been restored. Every household had blooming potted plants in front of their windows, benches for pedestrians to rest on were placed on the sidewalks, and children were playing in the green street gardens.
    However, after a few minutes, our car seemed to have left the Dresden urban area again, because now there were only trees and flowers on both sides of the road, without a single house. I was about to ask the German comrades accompanying us when the car entered an area with many newly built high-rise buildings and stopped in front of a hotel called "Astoria."
    After getting out of the car and being explained to by the German comrades, we understood what the "countryside" in this city was all about. It turned out that the open area we had just passed through was the city center area where Dresden's ancient buildings and forests of statues were concentrated. American planes had completely destroyed it. In the past few years, the residential and industrial areas on the outskirts of the city have been almost completely restored, and the city center has also been partially restored. However, because there are more ancient buildings here, the restoration speed is slower. At the same time, in order to build the Dresden city center even more beautifully than in the past, careful planning is required. Therefore, there are still some scorched areas that are now green open land. But the people's confidence and strength are ultimately greater than the cruel-hearted American generals. According to the decision of the Party and the government, the workers of Dresden will completely restore the city center area within the next three years.
    We had just arrived in Dresden when we smelled this strong atmosphere of peaceful labor.
    Early the next morning, Comrade Wagner, a member of the city's People's Committee, came to the hotel to accompany us to see the face of Dresden. He is an old socialist who came from a carpenter's background and participated in the German workers' movement at the beginning of this century. He grew up in Dresden, and after the war, he participated in the city's reconstruction work, so he knew both the old and the new Dresden very well.
    The tall and robust Wagner first took us to the City People's Committee. This is also a large building that was destroyed and rebuilt. Here, we saw the design model for the reconstruction of Dresden. Comrade Wagner pointed to the buildings on the model and told us which ones had been restored, which ones were being restored, which ones were newly built, and which ones were to be built. In the grand conference hall of the City People's Committee, gifts from famous cities in various fraternal countries were displayed to celebrate the 750th anniversary of the founding of Dresden.
    Then, Comrade Wagner took us to a street in a residential area, and the car stopped in front of a row of four-story residential buildings. Wagner pointed to this building and said: "This is an ordinary residential building, but it was one of the first batches of residences we restored after the war. From here, we started the restoration and reconstruction of Dresden."
    If we hadn't been there in person, we wouldn't have understood why Wagner had to bring us to this ordinary residence, nor would we have felt how much weight there was in his simple words.
    Dresden had a total of 220,000 housing units before the war, but on the night of February 13, 1945, more than 170,000 housing units were damaged, of which almost half were turned into ruins. These residences were built over a period of fifty to one hundred years. Just imagine how desolate Dresden was at that time; the prosperous city had practically ceased to exist. But after only ten years, most of the residential areas have been restored, flowers and curtains have reappeared in every residence, and mothers are pushing strollers along the clean sidewalks. The city's population has increased to more than 500,000. But this was not easy at all. For the one night of destruction perpetrated by the American generals with ulterior motives, the people of Dresden paid such a huge price in labor.
    We also came to a brand new area, where there are no buildings in the old style. At first glance, they are all new houses in a modern style, somewhat resembling our cultural and educational area in the western suburbs of Beijing. Our guess was confirmed by Comrade Wagner's pointing out that these buildings are all universities. The famous Dresden University of Technology is located here. Before the war, it had 2,000 students, but now it has more than 10,000 students. Dresden has become the center of technological research in the German Democratic Republic today, concentrating many famous German scientists and professors. The peaceful use of atomic energy is an important research project for scientists here.
    In addition to the University of Technology, Dresden also has the College of Transportation Science, the Railway Technology College, the Heavy Machinery Manufacturing College, as well as a Teachers' College, an Academy of Fine Arts, and a Dance Academy. A large-scale medical school is under construction. Therefore, Dresden is also the cultural and educational center of Democratic Germany.
    The Zwinger Palace is a place we have long heard of. The 750 precious oil paintings returned by the Soviet government are exhibited in this palace. After crossing a small bridge, we entered the vast courtyard of this 18th-century building. The palace is not particularly tall, but each building is a combination of hundreds and thousands of works of art. On the roof, under the eaves, and in the corridors, there are exquisite stone carvings everywhere. These stone carvings were obviously influenced by the sculptural styles of Italy and France, but they shimmer with the wisdom of the German working people.
    This palace was originally almost completely destroyed, and it has just been restored. Most of the stone carvings are also newly sculpted and installed. Some buildings on both sides of the palace are still being restored, and from the construction shed, there is a constant crisp sound of iron hammers striking stones. We curiously ran into the construction shed and found a young man holding a chisel in one hand and a hammer in the other, standing on a high stool, concentrating on carving a beautiful goddess stone sculpture more than a zhang tall. Next to him was the plaster model of this stone sculpture. We chatted with this young man. He is only twenty-three years old this year. He was originally a student at an art school. The government decided to restore the ancient buildings in the city, but almost every ancient building has numerous stone carvings, and there are very few old artists who can engage in this carving. Therefore, the training of young sculptors is very urgent. This young man has been able to work independently after studying for two years.
    After admiring the architecture of the palace, we went upstairs to the palace to see the oil painting exhibition. Here are collected famous works by Dutch, Italian, and German painters from the fifteenth to eighteenth centuries, especially many famous works by Dutch painters.
    Like many feudal kings, the Saxon king was a man who specialized in squandering the people's blood and sweat to build palaces for himself, but his characteristic was that he not only built several European-style palaces, but also built two Oriental-style palaces. One is in the Chinese style. Although not completely alike, it has some of the flavor of Chinese palaces, and the eaves are painted with portraits of people from the Qing Dynasty in our country. There is a huge and beautiful fountain garden in front of this palace, which was not damaged because it is far from the city center. Another Japanese-style palace has been destroyed and is being restored.
    Stepping out of the Zwinger Palace, we arrived at the famous Theater Square, where the Dresden Opera House is located, which has been completely restored. The Court Church on the right is still a pile of rubble, but it will soon be restored to its original appearance.
    The next day, we came to the opposite bank of the Elbe River, which is the most elegant residential area in Dresden. Villas and small Western-style houses are built against the mountain, and trams wind up the mountain. In the past, fascist dignitaries and large monopoly capitalists lived here. Now the government has distributed these houses to scientists, professors, and working people.
    With great interest, we visited the world-famous state-owned Zeiss factory and watched the production process of the famous "Contax" brand camera. The factory director and deputy factory director came out to warmly receive us and introduced the situation of their factory's production of new types of products. The factory not only produces cameras, but also produces movie cameras and projectors. A projector that can perform widescreen projection is about to be officially produced. This factory also produces a large number of inexpensive and high-quality ordinary cameras.
    Dresden has stood up from the ruins created by American imperialists, and its people have already decided to build Dresden more beautiful and prosperous than at any time in its 750-year history. We left the lovely Dresden with such a strong and beautiful feeling.

    This is the famous Zwinger Palace in Dresden, where the oil painting gallery is located.

    德累斯顿漫步
    张沛
    到德意志民主共和国旅行过的人，提起易北河边的德累斯顿，总有一种难忘的印象。当十八世纪德意志还处在封建割据没有成为一个统一国家的时候，德累斯顿是萨克森王国的首都，这里有许多宫殿都是萨克森王国时代修的，还有宫廷教堂、王国图书馆等著名的古建筑。每一座古建筑都装饰着各式各样的精巧的浮雕、壁画。以后，德累斯顿发展成为德国光学工业的中心，著名的蔡司工厂的主要部分就设在这里。德累斯顿倚山旁水，全城绿荫处处，是德国一个很美丽的城市。在战前，德累斯顿有六十多万的人口。
    1945年2月13日，苏军的前哨部队离开德累斯顿只有几公里了，希特勒匪徒已经开始向西逃跑了，眼看着德累斯顿就要回到人民的怀抱中了，可是就在这天晚上，美国将军们派了几百架轰炸机，在一夜之间差不多把这个城市毁掉了，杀死了三万多普通的德国人。
    这是一个连小孩子也看得出的卑鄙的阴谋……。
    七月末稍的一个下午，我们乘汽车从卡尔·马克思城来到了德累斯顿。
    车子进入市区以后，我注意地从车窗往外看，想看一看这个被毁掉了的城市已经恢复到什么程度了。我们都非常高兴，因为在长长的两旁排列着菩提树、橡树的绿色的街道旁边，所有的房屋差不多都恢复了，家家户户窗台前面放着盛开的盆景，人行道上安着供行人休息的长椅，孩子们在绿草如茵的街心花园内游玩。
    可是过了几分钟以后，我们的车子好像又离开了德累斯顿城区，因为这时道路两旁只有树木和花草而没有一所房子。我正在想问同行的德国同志，车子已经进入一个有许多新建的高层建筑的地方，在一个名叫“阿斯多里亚”的旅馆门口停下来。
    下车以后，经过德国同志的解释，我们才了解这个城市中的“乡村”是怎么回事，原来我们刚才经过的那一片旷野，是德累斯顿的古建筑汇集、雕像如林的市中心区，美国飞机把它彻底毁灭了。在过去的几年中，城市外围的住宅区、工业区差不多已经恢复了，市中心区也恢复了一部分，但是由于这里的古建筑比较多，恢复的速度比较慢，同时为了要把德累斯顿中心区建设得比过去更加美好，需要进行周密的规划，所以中心区还有一些曾经被烧焦过而现在是一片绿色的空旷的土地。但是人民的信心、力量毕竟比居心残忍的美国将军们要大得多，根据党和政府的决定，德累斯顿的劳动者要在今后三年内把市中心区完全恢复起来。
    我们刚刚来到德累斯顿，就嗅到了这种强烈的和平劳动的气息。
    第二天一早，市人民委员会的委员瓦格纳尔同志就跑到旅馆来，陪我们去看一看德累斯顿的面貌。这是一个木匠出身、本世纪初就参加德国工人运动的老社会主义者。他是在德累斯顿长大的，战后他又参加了城市的重建工作，所以旧的德累斯顿和新的德累斯顿，他都了如指掌。
    体格高大健壮的瓦格纳尔，首先把我们带到市人民委员会。这也是一所被炸毁而又重建起来的大型建筑。在这里我们看到了重建德累斯顿的设计模型，瓦格纳尔同志指着模型上的建筑物告诉我们，哪些已经恢复了，哪些正要恢复，哪些是新建的，哪些是将要建设的。在市人民委员会宏大的会议厅内，陈列着各个兄弟国家著名城市送来的礼品，庆祝德累斯顿建城七百五十周年。
    接着瓦格纳尔同志把我们带到一个住宅区的一条街，车子在一列四层楼的住宅面前停下来。瓦格纳尔指着这座楼房说：“这是一座普通的住宅楼房，但是它是战后我们恢复起来的第一批住宅，从这里，我们开始了德累斯顿的恢复和重建工作。”
    如果不是身临其境，我们不会理解为什么瓦格纳尔一定要把我们带到这所普通的住宅前面来，也不会感觉他说的这段简单的话里有多大的分量。
    德累斯顿在战前共有二十二万套住宅，可是就在1945年2月13日那个晚上，有十七万多套的住宅受到破坏，其中差不多有一半成了废墟。这些住宅都是在五十年到一百年的时间内先后修成的。想一想那时德累斯顿是如何的荒凉呵，繁华的城市实际上已经不存在了。可是仅仅经过了十年，大部分住宅区都已经恢复了，鲜花和窗帘又在每一个住宅出现了，母亲们又推着婴儿车在整洁的人行道上散步了。城市的人口已增加到五十多万。可是这并不是很轻易的，为了美国将军们心怀叵测的一夜破坏，德累斯顿人民付出了多么巨大的劳动呵。
    我们又来到了一个崭新的地区，这里没有古老形式的建筑，一眼看得出都是现代风格的新房子，某些地方有些像我们北京西郊的文教区。我们的猜想被瓦格纳尔同志的指点证实了，这些建筑都是高等学校的。著名的德累斯顿高等技术学校就在这里。战前它有二千个学生，可是现在它拥有一万多学生。德累斯顿今天已成为德意志民主共和国技术研究的中心，这里集中了许多德国著名的科学家和教授，原子能的和平利用是这里的科学家们一项重要的研究项目。
    除了高等技术学校以外，德累斯顿还有交通科学学院、铁路技术学院、重型机器制造学院以及师范学院、美术学院、舞蹈学院。规模很大的医学院正在建筑中。因之，德累斯顿又是民主德国的文化教育的中心。
    茨温格尔宫是我们久已闻名的地方，由苏联政府送还的七百五十幅名贵的油画，就在这座宫殿里展览。过一个小桥，我们就进入这个十八世纪建筑的宫殿内广阔的庭院。宫殿并不特别高大，但每一座房屋都是成百成千艺术品的结合。在屋顶上，屋檐下，走廊里，到处都有精美的石雕。这些石雕显然是受了意大利、法国雕塑风格的影响，但是它闪烁着德国劳动人民的智慧。
    这座宫殿原来也几乎全部破坏了，刚刚恢复不久，大部分石雕也都是新近塑成安上的。宫殿的两侧还有一部分建筑正在恢复，从建筑棚里不时传出一阵阵清脆的铁锤敲击石头的声音。我们好奇地跑进建筑棚里，发现一个青年一手拿凿子一手拿锤子，站在一个高凳上，正在专心地雕凿一个一丈多高的美丽的女神石雕，旁边立着的是这个石雕的石膏模型。我们和这个青年攀谈起来，他今年才二十三岁，原来是一个美术学校的学生，政府决定要恢复城内的古建筑，可是每一座古建筑差不多都有众多的石雕，而能够从事这项雕刻的老艺人已经很少，于是培养青年雕塑家就十分迫切了。这个青年在学习了两年以后现在已经能独立工作了。
    欣赏了宫殿的建筑以后，我们到宫殿的楼上看了油画展览，这里搜集的都是十五世纪到十八世纪荷兰、意大利、德国大画家的著名作品，特别是荷兰画家的名作相当多。
    萨克森国王像许多封建国王一样，是一个专门喜欢挥霍人民的血汗来为自己建筑宫殿的人，但是他的特点是不仅是建筑了好几个欧洲形式的宫殿，而且还建筑了两个东方形式的宫殿。一个是中国形式的，虽然不完全像，但有一些中国宫殿的风味，屋檐四周还绘有我国清代的人像。这个宫殿前面有一个巨大而优美的喷泉花园，因为离市区较远没有受到破坏。另一个日本式的宫殿已经破坏了，正在恢复中。
    步出茨温格尔宫，就是著名的剧院广场，德累斯顿歌剧院就在这里，它已经完全恢复了。右边的宫廷教堂还是一片断瓦残垣，但是不久它就要恢复原来的面貌了。
    第二天我们来到易北河对岸，这里是德累斯顿最幽雅的住宅区，一幢幢别墅式的小洋房倚山建筑，电车盘山而上，以前在这里住的都是法西斯显贵、大垄断资本家，现在政府把这些房屋分配给科学家、教授和劳动人民居住了。
    我们怀着巨大兴趣，参观了名闻世界的国营蔡司工厂，看了著名的“康塔克司”牌照像机的生产过程。这个厂的厂长和副厂长都出来热烈地接待我们，并且向我们介绍他们工厂生产新种类产品的情况。工厂不仅生产照相机，还生产电影摄影机和放映机，一种能够进行宽银幕放映的放映机就要正式生产了。这个工厂还生产大量价廉物美的普通照相机。
    德累斯顿，已经从美帝国主义者所制造的废墟上站立起来了，而且它的人民已经决心要把德累斯顿建设得比它七百五十年历史上任何时期都更加美丽和繁荣。我们就是带着这样强烈而美好的感觉，离开了可爱的德累斯顿。
                            1956年9月（附图片）
    这是德累斯顿有名的茨温格尔宫，油画陈列馆就在这里面。
