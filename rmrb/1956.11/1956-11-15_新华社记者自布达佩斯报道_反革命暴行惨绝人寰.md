Xinhua News Agency report from Budapest

Counter-Revolutionary Atrocities are Inhuman

Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, November 14th (Reporter Li Nan): The white terror created by counter-revolutionaries during the riots ten days ago has left a painful and unforgettable memory in the hearts of the Hungarian people who are rebuilding normal order.

In the short period from the end of October to the beginning of November, the active fighters of Hungarian socialism and patriotic people loyal to the people's democratic system were subjected to brutal persecution and massacre. In Budapest's Köztársaság Square, counter-revolutionaries used artillery to destroy the building of the Municipal Party Committee, and the secretary of the Party organization was killed. The "Free People's Daily" newspaper office was also burned down. Armed thugs searched and attacked the residences of communists and patriots everywhere. People often saw armed thugs ambushing near buildings or bridges, kidnapping entire families of patriots. Corpses were seen hanging on balconies and trees; someone saw seven corpses hanging on a tree between Marx Square and the Parliament Building. Sometimes, after smashing people's skulls, the thugs would hang the corpses on utility poles, and sometimes after killing people, they would stick a bayonet in their mouths. They even attacked planes, trucks, and ambulances transporting the wounded, killing the wounded and sick in hospitals. In many counties in the outer provinces, counter-revolutionaries established armed gendarmerie organizations. In Szabolcs-Szatmár County, one village compiled a list of two hundred communists to be slaughtered. In Győr, one of the largest cities, a counter-revolutionary military tribunal was established, sentencing the secretaries of Party organizations in cities and rural areas to death.

In these few short days, Hungarian airspace was opened, and the border between Hungary and Austria was also opened. One day, dozens of planes flew in from West Germany and Vienna, bringing in weapons and counter-revolutionaries under the guise of the Red Cross. Officers and police from the Horthy regime returned with weapons. In a few days, about ten thousand prisoners were released from prisons. A former gendarme in Szabolcs-Szatmár County, after getting a weapon, said, "Now I will take revenge."

In these few short days, former factory owners were preparing to take back their factories, while landlords were also preparing to take back their land. A former shareholder of a wool factory in Győr telegraphed from Vienna saying that he would soon return to handle the takeover procedures. The owner of the Birédi cement factory, which had been nationalized, told the workers that he would reclaim the factory. Officers from the Horthy regime put on their old uniforms again and went to the parliament to demand factories and land. In these few short days, the word "socialism" suddenly disappeared. Newly emerged newspapers of all kinds spread all kinds of rumors. Marxist-Leninist books and publications were burned. "Victory" brand cars and "ZIM" brand cars were attacked on the streets. Only after the establishment of the Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government and the assistance of the Soviet army, was the counter-revolutionary terror that had just begun stopped.

    反革命暴行惨绝人寰
    新华社布达佩斯14日电　本社记者李楠报道：十天前暴乱时期反革命分子造成的白色恐怖，在重建正常秩序的匈牙利人民的心中，留下了惨痛的难忘的记忆。
    在从10月底到11月初这个短短的时期里，匈牙利社会主义的积极的战士们、忠于人民民主制度的爱国人士遭到了残暴的迫害和屠杀。在布达佩斯克兹塔尔沙沙格广场，反革命分子用大炮摧毁了市党委会的房子，党组织的书记被杀害了。“自由人民报”报社也被烧毁了。武装暴徒到处搜查和袭击共产党人和爱国人士的住宅。常常有人看到武装暴徒埋伏在建筑物或桥梁边绑架爱国者的全家大小。阳台上、树上都看到吊着的尸体，有人在马克思广场和议会大厦之间看到一棵树上就悬着七具尸首。暴徒们有时把人的脑壳打碎后还把尸体吊在电线杆子上，有时把人杀死了还在口中插一把刺刀。他们甚至袭击运输伤员的飞机、卡车和救护车，打死医院中的伤员和病人。在外省许多县的反革命分子建立了武装的宪兵组织。在索伯尔齐—沙特马尔州，一个村庄就开列了一张要屠杀的二百个共产党人的名单。在吉厄尔的一个最大的城市中，成立了一个反革命的军事法庭，把城市和农村中的党组织的书记们判处死刑。
    在这短短的几天内，匈牙利的领空开放了，匈牙利同奥地利之间的边界也开放了。有一天，数十架飞机从西德和维也纳飞进来，在红十字会的名义下把武器和反革命分子运了进来。霍尔蒂政权时期的军官和警察又拿着武器回来了。几天中约有一万个犯人被放出监狱。索伯尔齐—沙特马尔州有一个前宪兵拿到武器后说，现在我要报仇了。
    在这短短的几天内，从前的工厂主已经准备收回他们的工厂，同时地主们也准备收回他们的土地。吉厄尔的毛织工厂的一个前股东从维也纳打电报来说，他不久将要回来办理接收的手续。已经被收归国有的比来迪水泥厂的厂主对工人们说，他将重新收回这个工厂。霍尔蒂政权时期的军官重又穿上他们以前的军服，到议会去索要工厂和土地。在这短短的几天内，社会主义这个字眼忽然消失了。新出现的形形色色的报纸散布了各种各样的谣言。马克思列宁主义的书籍和刊物被焚烧了。“胜利”牌汽车和“齐姆”牌汽车在街上受到攻击。只是在工农革命政府建立起来和苏联军队进行帮助以后，才把刚刚开始的反革命恐怖制止了下去。（附图片）
