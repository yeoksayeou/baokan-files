Sun Yat-sen's Thoughts on National Defense
Zou Shumin

The era in which Mr. Sun Yat-sen lived was a time when imperialism was intensifying its outward expansion, aggression, and plunder against our country, and it was also an era of national defense dereliction in our country. Mr. Sun Yat-sen personally witnessed the facts of imperialism robbing our country's territory, infringing upon our country's sovereignty, insulting our people, and forcing our country to sign unequal treaties. He developed a lofty sense of national consciousness and patriotism very early on, and he also realized the importance of national defense very early on, often saying that without national defense, there would be no country. However, on the other hand, he personally witnessed the Qing government being昏庸 old and朽,腐败 incompetent, and unable to establish national defense and resist foreign aggression. Moreover, after several blows such as the Opium War and the Anglo-French Allied Forces, especially after the shock of the great Taiping Heavenly Kingdom revolutionary movement, the Qing Dynasty had lost its traditional sense of self-respect externally and turned to a sense of inferiority and媚外。Regarding national interests, they spared no effort to make concessions and give them away. Internally, they strengthened control and oppression, adopting a "rather give to foreign friends than to domestic slaves" attitude, so that the dangerous situation of betraying rights and humiliating the country occurred one after another and became increasingly serious. Under such circumstances, Mr. Sun Yat-sen determined that only by overthrowing the Qing Dynasty and establishing the Republic of China could we talk about building national defense, resisting aggression, and making our country stand tall in the world and no longer be subject to the slaughter of imperialism. Since the Qing Dynasty's defeat in the Sino-French War in 1885, Mr. Sun Yat-sen had been determined to "overthrow the Qing Dynasty and establish the Republic of China." After ten failures, he finally achieved victory in the Revolution of 1911 and overthrew the rule of the Qing Dynasty.

After the Qing Dynasty was overthrown, China originally had the conditions to build national defense, and Mr. Sun Yat-sen also particularly emphasized the importance of national defense and military preparations at this time. In 1912, Mr. Sun Yat-sen said: "Today's urgent task lies in expanding military preparations to complete a solid national defense, and then we can keep pace with the world's great powers" ("Speech at the Welcome Meeting of the Guangdong Military"). In 1913, he said again: "China's navy, combining all large and small warships in the country, cannot exceed a hundred. If unfortunately there is foreign aggression, then China is in danger. Why? Our country's warships are not as strong as those of foreign countries, our guns and cannons are not as sophisticated as those of foreign countries, and our arsenals are not as well-equipped as those of foreign countries. Therefore, if China wants to become rich and strong today, it must vigorously implement the expansion of new military preparations. Comrades say that China's national defense does not have considerable military construction, which is the reason why China is not rich and strong, which is true. Therefore, China wants to diligently cultivate military preparations, and then it can guarantee national independence and national survival. … I think today's democratic government will definitely strive to reorganize new military construction and reform China's old military preparations, and will not have the corruption of the old Qing government. Now, strong neighbors are like tigers, all wanting to swallow our country. If our country does not have considerable military preparations for self-defense, then our country will definitely be eaten by tigers" ("Letter to Chen Ying Shishi"). It can be seen that since the overthrow of the Qing Dynasty, Mr. Sun Yat-sen paid great attention to our country's national defense construction.

However, the fruits of the Revolution of 1911 were unfortunately usurped by the Northern Warlords. Under the instruction and support of imperialism, they either proclaimed themselves emperors or ruined the law and harmed the people. In short, they disregarded the interests of the country and the nation. Mr. Sun Yat-sen had to devote a lot of energy to lead the struggle against the warlords. In the more than ten years after the establishment of the Republic of China, Mr. Sun Yat-sen never obtained a peaceful environment for national construction and large-scale national defense construction.

However, in such difficult and troubled years, as a great patriot and outstanding fighter against imperialism, Mr. Sun Yat-sen was always concerned about our country's national defense construction. We can deeply understand this from his usual speeches and writings. On July 8, 1921, in a letter to Mr. Liao Zhongkai, Mr. Sun Yat-sen proposed the outline of his book "Ten-Year National Defense Plan," totaling sixty-two articles. Although Mr. Sun Yat-sen did not have time to complete the writing of this book, we can also see from these sixty-two articles how grand the scale of his ideal national defense plan was. This article does not intend to discuss in detail Mr. Sun Yat-sen's ideal national defense plan, but only to give a brief introduction to Mr. Sun Yat-sen's national defense thoughts based on personal learning.

First, although Mr. Sun Yat-sen repeatedly emphasized national defense, his purpose was purely for self-defense and not for aggression. Therefore, Mr. Sun Yat-sen resolutely opposed the imperialist war of aggression, calling this kind of war "行霸道"; at the same time, when the country's territory and sovereignty were violated, he unhesitatingly advocated exercising a war of self-defense, and called this kind of war a just war, using public reason to resist power, which is顺天行道 rather than逆天行道. Mr. Sun Yat-sen once said: "Our Chinese nation, upholding peace and abiding by the law, is rooted in nature. We will never lightly start a war unless it is out of self-defense." ("Proclamation of the Provisional Grand President to All Friendly Nations") He also said: "Only I mean China has no intention of aggression, because we are devoted to peace, and the reason why we want large land and naval forces is only for self-preservation and not to attack others" ("Conversation with Hong Kong and Western Newspaper Reporters"). Mr. Sun Yat-sen extremely hated power politics and aggression, so he designated resisting aggression and power politics as one of the national policies. In the fourth article of his proposed "Outline of National Construction," there is a provision that "the government should resist foreign aggression and power politics." In the outline of the "Ten-Year National Defense Plan," there are also clauses such as "Strategies to resist the aggression of various countries against China" and "Plans to recover all our lost territories and leased lands and concessions." Mr. Sun Yat-sen believed at the time that future wars would be wars of power politics and public reason. Power politics comes from the side of a few oppressors, while public reason stands on the side of the vast majority of the oppressed. After the liberation of the Chinese nation, there is still a responsibility to help and unite the vast oppressed people in the world to jointly resist aggression and power politics. To do this, it is necessary to have sufficient national defense forces. Mr. Sun Yat-sen yearned very much for a world of Datong where "大道之行也，天下为公", but he believed that as long as there are still aggressive powers and ambitious people in the world, this world of Datong where "the old are provided for, the strong are employed, and the young are cared for" will not come. According to Mr. Sun Yat-sen's view, strengthening national defense forces to resist aggression and power politics is still a necessary means to achieve his ideal world of Datong.

Second, Mr. Sun Yat-sen believed that to have a modern national defense, there must be modern military preparations. Therefore, in the outline of the "Ten-Year National Defense Plan," he explicitly listed strengthening military preparations as a national policy, and regarded the establishment of a modern army, navy, and air force as the foundation for strengthening military preparations. After the October Revolution in 1917, Mr. Sun Yat-sen was extremely excited about the birth of the Soviet state and gave it great hope. He saw that the young Soviet Republic, although subjected to armed intervention by imperialist countries such as Britain, France, Japan, and the United States, was finally able to defeat imperialist intervention and defend the Soviet state because it had established a revolutionary Red Army. Therefore, he very much wanted to establish a modern revolutionary army as the basic armed force. He once said: "When the Russian Revolution occurred, although it was the general revolutionary party members who acted as pioneers to fight against the Russian Emperor, as soon as the revolution succeeded, they immediately organized a revolutionary army; later, because there was a revolutionary army to support the revolutionary party and continue to fight, even if they encountered many great obstacles, they were still able to achieve great success in a short period of time." ("Speech at the Opening of the Army Military Academy") Because of his desire to absorb the Soviet Union's experience in building the army, in 1923, Mr. Sun Yat-sen sent people to the Soviet Union to investigate the organization and training of the Red Army. In 1924, with the help of the Chinese Communist Party and Soviet technical assistance, a revolutionary armed force was finally established. Mr. Sun Yat-sen had great hope for this revolutionary armed force at that time. He encouraged them not to have the psychology of seeking promotion and getting rich, but to be determined to save the country and the people and complete the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal revolutionary cause. Mr. Sun Yat-sen made many speeches on army building. To sum up, there are the following points that deserve our attention:

1.  Building the army with doctrine. Mr. Sun Yat-sen believed that the revolutionary army should have faith, and only with faith can it have strength. The faith that the revolutionary army should have at that time was the Three People's Principles. On February 23, 1924, Mr. Sun Yat-sen said: "The responsibility of the revolutionary army is to turn the unequal world into an equal one; only by understanding the Three People's Principles that fight against inequality can one be a revolutionary soldier. The revolutionary army is fighting for the Three People's Principles and sacrificing for the Three People's Principles." ("The Responsibility of Saving the Country and the People Lies in the Revolutionary Army") As everyone knows, the Three People's Principles that Mr. Sun Yat-sen spoke of at this time were not the old Three People's Principles, but the new Three People's Principles, that is, the Three People's Principles that adopted the three major policies of alliance with Russia, alliance with the Communist Party, and assistance to farmers and workers. This kind of Three People's Principles was progressive and revolutionary at that time, and it was also what the Chinese Communists at that time were willing to fight for. Mr. Sun Yat-sen made every effort to instill the new Three People's Principles in the revolutionary army at that time and advocated building the army with doctrine, which was of great significance.

2.  It is necessary to make military force the military force of the people. Mr. Sun Yat-sen believed that the combination of military force and the people is one of the important factors in building the army. In the era of warlord melee after the Republic of China, the armies of all the warlords were armies combined with imperialism. Under the instruction of imperialism, they divided the country and undermined peace and unity. Mr. Sun Yat-sen deeply hated this situation and believed that this kind of army would definitely have no future. He once affirmed: "All military forces that combine with imperialism will be defeated, and conversely, those that combine with the people to accelerate the progress of the National Revolution will be victorious. From today onwards, a new era of National Revolution should be marked, so that the phenomenon of military force combining with imperialism will be permanently eliminated in the country. The phenomenon that will replace it, the first step is to make military force combine with the people, and the second step is to make military force the military force of the people" ("Declaration of the Northward Journey"). In Mr. Sun Yat-sen's view, protecting the country and defending the people is the duty of soldiers. If military force is not military force combined with the people, but military force combined with imperialism, it will definitely not be able to fulfill the sacred duty of soldiers to protect the country and defend the people, and will even betray the interests of the country and the nation.

3.  Strengthening military education. Mr. Sun Yat-sen believed that if the army is to be able to shoulder the responsibility of protecting the country and defending the people, it is necessary to strengthen military education so that every soldier can understand the great cause of the revolution and the glorious responsibilities they shoulder. In his speech to the Yunnan-Guangdong-Jiangxi armies in Guilin, he said: "Now, in front of you, there is an extraordinary cause that must be accomplished by extraordinary soldiers. If you want to take on an extraordinary cause, you must receive extraordinary education. What is this extraordinary education? That is, the education of the revolutionary spirit of soldiers." ("Military Spiritual Education") Mr. Sun Yat-sen also took the revolutionary Three People's Principles and wisdom, benevolence, courage, and determination as the content of military spiritual education. At the same time, he also emphasized material education. In the outline of the "Ten-Year National Defense Plan," he listed the "Comparison of Military Spiritual Education and Material Education," advocating that both must be paid attention to at the same time, emphasizing that a modern army must be enriched with modern science and technology. Mr. Sun Yat-sen deeply felt that our country's material science and technology were backward, so it was often invaded by imperialist countries with high levels of science and technology. He loudly called on revolutionary soldiers and the people of the whole country to catch up with Western countries in this regard.

4.  Improving military discipline. Mr. Sun Yat-sen regarded military discipline as the lifeline of the army, believing that with military discipline, the entire army's脈胳 can be connected from top to bottom, and the army's combat effectiveness can be fully exerted. He often said that the old China was like a tray of loose sand, everyone only knew the small self, but did not know the big self, only knew the family and clan, but did not know the nation, so he especially emphasized that for the freedom of the country and the nation, personal freedom can be sacrificed, and he demanded that soldiers do this even more. He once said: "When soldiers can sacrifice freedom, they can obey orders and loyally serve the country, so that the country has freedom." ("The Second Lecture on the Principle of People's Rights") He also said: "If soldiers and officials use the excuse of republic and freedom to destroy discipline, the state organs can never be unified. If the organs cannot be unified, the executive officers have no special responsibility, like a tray of loose sand, how can they serve the people! Therefore, what is valued in the organs is to obey discipline" ("The True Meaning of Republic and Freedom"). In the era of the Tongmenghui and the era of overthrowing Yuan Shikai, Mr. Sun Yat-sen had strict military discipline. For example, in the era of the Tongmenghui, Mr. Sun Yat-sen promulgated twenty-two military laws for the revolutionary troops at that time. For example, "those who surrender to the enemy and are captured will be killed," "those who privately communicate military intelligence to the enemy will be killed," "those who rape women will be killed," "those who burn and kill innocent people will be killed," "those who privately enter innocent people's homes will be punished," "those who steal will be punished," "those who gamble will be punished," "those who smoke opium will be punished," and "those who extort and forcibly buy will be punished according to the circumstances," all of which were very severe. At the same time, Mr. Sun Yat-sen also emphasized consciously abiding by military discipline. He believed that as long as everyone understands that they are fighting for the revolutionary doctrine, they will consciously abide by discipline.

5.  Implementing the policy of elite troops, demobilization, and turning soldiers into workers. Mr. Sun Yat-sen advocated that the national defense army should adopt the principle of elite troops in order to improve the quality of the army, enrich the organization, improve the command unit in war, and better exert combat effectiveness. In the outline of the "Ten-Year National Defense Plan," he proposed "Implementing a National Elite Troops Policy." At the same time, Mr. Sun Yat-sen also advocated that when the country moves from wartime to peacetime, a policy of demobilization should be implemented in order to reduce the country's military expenditure and achieve the goal of elite troops and simple administration. He also advocated that demobilization should be combined with the policy of turning soldiers into workers. In this way, the unemployment phenomenon that may occur after demobilization can be avoided, and industries can be developed and national income can be increased. In his later years, when Mr. Sun Yat-sen advocated the peaceful reunification of China, he strongly advocated the policy of demobilization and turning soldiers into workers.

Mr. Sun Yat-sen's thoughts on army building are part of his thoughts on national defense. At that time, in his view, only by establishing a modern national defense army can we protect the country and defend the people and resist aggression. Only by relying on his thoughts on army building can we establish the modern national defense army he envisioned. Therefore, to study Mr. Sun Yat-sen's thoughts on national defense, we must also study his thoughts on army building.

Third, national defense is combined with people's livelihood, and people's livelihood is the mother of national defense construction. This is another important feature of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's thoughts on national defense. Mr. Sun Yat-sen once said: "If mankind is to survive, it must have two of the greatest things: the first is protection, and the second is sustenance. Protection and sustenance are the two major things that mankind does every day. Protection is self-defense,... and sustenance is foraging. This self-defense and foraging are the two major things for mankind to maintain survival." ("The First Lecture on the Principle of People's Rights") According to Mr. Sun Yat-sen's meaning, when there is competition between countries, if a country wants to survive independently, it must have the ability to defend itself, that is, it must build national defense. Mr. Sun Yat-sen also believed that the first step in solving the problem of people's livelihood is to solve the "food problem." The so-called foraging is to solve the "food" problem. Of course, the problem of people's livelihood is not just a "food" problem. Mr. Sun Yat-sen pointed out in the second article of the "Outline of National Construction": "The most important thing in construction is people's livelihood. Therefore, for the four major needs of food, clothing, housing, and transportation of the people throughout the country, the government should cooperate with the people to develop agriculture to meet the people's food needs; jointly develop weaving to enrich the people's clothing; build various types of houses according to major plans to make people happy to live in; and repair roads and canals to facilitate the people's travel." It can be seen that the problem of people's livelihood includes not only "eating" but also needs such as clothing, housing, and transportation. Mr. Sun Yat-sen believed that the problem of people's livelihood and the problem of national defense are closely related. The more abundant people's livelihood is, the stronger the national defense force will be, and the stronger the national defense force is, the more it can guarantee the development of people's livelihood. Therefore, he believed that the two must be combined and cannot be neglected. But he also believed that people's livelihood is the mother of national defense construction. The so-called "sufficient food and sufficient soldiers" and "rich people and strong country," he had this view long ago. As early as in his early years when he wrote the "Letter to Li Hongzhang," he advocated using "people can make the best of their talents, land can make the best of its benefits, things can make the best of their uses, and goods can flow smoothly" as a means to make the people rich and the country strong. He said: "If people can make the best of their talents, everything will prosper; if land can make the best of its benefits, the people will have sufficient food; if things can make the best of their uses, the financial resources will be sufficient; if goods can flow smoothly, the financial sources will be abundant. Therefore, it is said: these four are the great principles of wealth and strength, and the great foundation of governing the country. Once the four are obtained, then we will improve our political principles, expand our scale, manage our military strength, and protect our border states, and Europe will be able to match it." He also said that if "we do not rush to do these four things, but only focus on strong ships and sharp cannons, it is abandoning the root and seeking the tip." (All seen in "Letter to Li Hongzhang") Mr. Sun Yat-sen's thinking actually reflected the relationship between national defense construction and economic construction, believing that the two must be combined, and economic construction is the foundation of national defense construction. The book "Industrial Plan" that he wrote later mainly focused on economic construction and enriching people's livelihood, but at the same time, it adapted to the needs of national defense and ran through the idea of combining national defense with people's livelihood and combining national defense construction with economic construction. For example, the plan for the opening up of waterways and seaports, the establishment of a railway central network, the mining of coal, iron, and other minerals, and the establishment of cement plants, machinery manufacturing plants, shipbuilding plants, and vehicle manufacturing plants, while focusing on economic prosperity and enriching people's livelihood, can also meet the needs of national defense. For example, the so-called large ports in the East, North, and South are commercial ports in peacetime and can become naval ports in wartime; the so-called railway systems in the Southeast, Northeast, Northwest, and Plateau are the links for the transfer of goods and wealth in peacetime and can become the channels for the collection and distribution of troops in national defense strategy in wartime. In addition, in the outline of the "Ten-Year National Defense Plan," Mr. Sun Yat-sen also specifically listed the "Relationship between National Defense and Industrial Plans." It can be seen that he never advocated separating from people's livelihood and economic construction and one-sidedly emphasizing national defense construction.

The above is a simple and far from complete introduction to the outline of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's thoughts on national defense. We know that Mr. Sun Yat-sen was a great and thorough patriot and democrat. Under the conditions of the old semi-colonial and semi-feudal China, all true patriots and democrats had to raise the banner of anti-imperialism and anti-feudalism. It was precisely because Mr. Sun Yat-sen held high this banner that he was able to see the powerful revolutionary forces of the international working class and our country's working class in his later years, and he dared to announce the alliance with Soviet Russia, cooperate with the Chinese Communist Party, and be determined to rely on this force to resist the powerful forces of imperialism and seek the victory of the revolution and the consolidation of national defense.

It is precisely because Mr. Sun Yat-sen bravely and resolutely stood on the position of opposing imperialism that his thoughts on national defense were able to conform to the national interests and the interests of the people at that time and be left to us as a valuable heritage to learn from. Of course, due to changes in historical conditions, we should understand the problem from a developmental point of view when studying Mr. Sun Yat-sen's thoughts on national defense. For example, Mr. Sun Yat-sen at that time emphasized explaining our love of peace and opposition to aggression from the perspective of national nature, but today we should explain this from the nature of the socialist system. For another example, Mr. Sun Yat-sen at that time emphasized using the Three People's Principles to educate soldiers, while today we should emphasize using Marxism-Leninism and using socialism and communism to educate our national defense fighters. However, no matter how historical conditions change, Mr. Sun Yat-sen's thoughts on national defense will always shine brightly. Because his purpose of building national defense is to defend the country, defend the people's lives, resist oppressors, and resist aggressive powers, which represents the common aspirations of hundreds of millions of working people and oppressed nations in the world. Now, imperialism still exists, the threat of imperialism invading our country still exists, and the facts of imperialism invading weak nations exist even more seriously. It is not without practical significance to study Mr. Sun Yat-sen's thoughts on national defense and draw lessons from it.

Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people have inherited and greatly developed Mr. Sun Yat-sen's great ideal of building national defense. The armed forces of the Chinese people have given the imperialists a heavy blow. Now, the national defense armed forces possessed by the Chinese people are even more powerful. How happy would Mr. Sun Yat-sen be if he could see this situation! Only those unworthy disciples of Mr. Sun Yat-sen who remain in Taiwan, colluding with imperialism and hating the revolutionary people, have completely abandoned Mr. Sun Yat-sen's national defense ideals, and have not turned their guns at imperialism to this day, so that the motherland can complete the great cause of peaceful reunification that Mr. Sun Yat-sen longed for. If they are willing to take the opportunity of commemorating Mr. Sun Yat-sen's birthday to review Mr. Sun Yat-sen's thoughts on national defense, they should really repent.

    孙中山的国防思想
    邹树民
    孙中山先生所处的时代，是帝国主义加紧向外发展，侵略和掠夺我国的时代，也是我国国防废弛的时代。孙中山先生亲眼看到帝国主义抢劫我国领土，侵犯我国主权，侮辱我国人民，强迫我国订立不平等条约的种种事实，很早就产生了一种崇高的民族意识和爱国主义情感，也很早就意识到国防的重要，常说没有国防就没有国家；可是，另方面，他又亲眼看到清朝政府昏庸老朽，腐败无能，不可能建立国防，抵御外患，而且经过了鸦片战争、英法联军等几次打击，特别是经过伟大的太平天国革命运动的震撼以后，清朝皇朝对外则已丧失了传统的自尊心理，转而产生了自卑的、媚外的心理，对国家权益，不惜百般让步，拱手送人，对内则加强统制和压迫，采取“宁赠友邦，毋畀家奴”的态度，以致丧权辱国的险象，接连地发生，而且愈演愈烈。在这种情况下，孙中山先生就认定只有推翻清廷，创建民国以后，才谈得上建设国防，抵御侵略，使我国屹立于世界，不再遭受帝国主义的宰割。自1885年中法战争清廷失败以后，孙中山先生便已抱定了“倾复清廷创建民国”的志愿，先后经过了十次的失败，终于在1911年取得了辛亥革命的胜利，推翻了清廷的统治。
    清皇朝推翻以后，中国本来已经有了建设国防的条件，孙中山先生这时也特别强调国防军备建设的重要。1912年孙中山先生就说：“今日要务，在乎扩张军备，以完成巩固之国防，然后可与世界列强并驾齐驱”（“广东军界欢迎会上演辞”）。1913年又说：“中国之海军，合全国大小战舰，不能过百只，设不幸有外侮，则中国危矣。何也？我国之兵船不如外国之坚利，枪炮不如外国之精锐也，兵工厂不如外国设备齐全也。故中国今欲富强，非励行扩张新军备不可。同志谓中国国防不有相当武备建设，此中国不富强的原因，诚是也。故中国欲勤修军备，然后可保障国家独立民族生存也。……吾想今日民主政府，必定努力整理新军备建设，改革中国旧兵备也，而不有昔日满清政府之腐败也。现在强邻如虎，各欲吞食我国，若我国不有相当武备自卫，则我国必为虎所食也”（“致陈英士书”）。可见孙中山先生自推翻清廷以后，对我国国防建设，就给予极大的注意。
    但是，辛亥革命的果实，不幸被北洋军阀所篡夺。他们在帝国主义的指使和支持下，或帝制自为，或毁法殃民，总之是置国家民族利益于不顾。孙中山先生又不得不以很大精力来领导反对军阀的斗争。在民国成立以后的十多年间，孙中山先生始终没有获得和平建国、从事大规模国防建设的环境。
    然而，就在这样艰难困苦、饱经患难的年代中，作为伟大的爱国主义者和反对帝国主义的杰出战士的孙中山先生，对我国的国防建设，还是时刻关心着的。我们从他平时的言论和著作中，可以深刻地体会到这一点。1921年7月8日，孙中山先生在给廖仲恺先生的手札中，曾提出了他的“十年国防计划”一书的纲目，共计六十二条，孙中山先生虽没有来得及完成这部书的写作，但从这六十二条纲目中，我们也可以看出他所理想的国防计划，规模是何等宏大。本文不打算详细地来论述孙中山先生理想的国防计划，仅以个人学习所得，对孙中山先生的国防思想，作一简略的介绍。
    第一，孙中山先生虽然一再强调国防，但其目的纯粹为了自卫，而不是为了侵略。因此，孙中山先生坚决地反对帝国主义的侵略战争，把这种战争称之为“行霸道”；同时，当国家的领土和主权受到侵犯时，他又毫不犹豫地主张行使自卫战，并称这种战争是正义战，是以公理来反抗强权，是顺天行道而不是逆天行道。孙中山先生曾说：“盖吾中华民族，和平守法，根于天性，非出于自卫之不得已，决不肯轻启战争。”（“临时大总统布告各友邦书”）又说：“唯吾意中国无侵略志，因吾人志尚和平，吾人之所以要水陆大军者，只为自保而非攻人”（“对香港与西报记者谈话”）。孙中山先生极其憎恶强权，憎恶侵略，因而把抵抗侵略强权，定为国策之一，在他拟定的“建国大纲”第四条中，就有“对于国外之侵略强权，政府当抵御之”的规定。而在“十年国防计划”纲目中，也有“抵御各国侵略中国计划之方略”和“收回我国一切丧失疆土及租借地租界割让地之计划”等条款。孙中山先生当时就认为，今后的战争将是强权和公理的战争，强权是来自少数的压迫者方面，而公理则是站在绝大多数的被压迫者方面，中华民族解放以后，还有责任帮助和联合世界上广大的被压迫者，共同抵抗侵略和强权，而要做到这一点，就必须有充足的国防力量。孙中山先生十分向往于一个“大道之行也，天下为公”的大同世界，但认为只要世界上还有侵略强权，还有野心家存在，那么，这个“老有所终，壮有所用，幼有所养”的大同世界，就不会到来。按照孙中山先生的看法，充实国防力量以反抗侵略强权，还是达到他所理想的大同世界的一种必要手段。
    第二，孙中山先生以为：要有现代化的国防，必须有现代化的军备。因此，在“十年国防计划”纲目中，他曾经明确地把充实军备列为立国的政策，并把建立现代化的海陆空军看作是充实军备的基础。1917年10月革命以后，孙中山先生对苏维埃国家的诞生，极感兴奋，也给予极大的希望。他看到年轻的苏维埃共和国虽然遭到英、法、日、美等帝国主义国家的武装干涉，但因为建立了革命的红军，终于能够战胜帝国主义的干涉，保卫苏维埃国家。因此，他很想建立一支现代化的革命军，作为基本的武装力量。他曾经说过：“俄国发生革命的时候，虽然是一般革命党员做先锋，去同俄皇奋斗，但是革命一经成功，便马上组织革命军；后来因为有了革命军做革命党的后援，继续去奋斗，所以就是遇到了许多大障碍，还是能够在短时间之内，大告成功。”（“陆军军官学校开学演说”）由于渴望吸取苏联建军的经验，1923年，孙中山先生曾派人去苏联考察红军的组织和训练，1924年，在中国共产党的帮助和苏联的技术援助下，终于树立了一支革命武装。孙中山先生当时对这支革命武装是怀有很大希望的。他勉励他们不要存升官发财的心理，而要立志救国救民，完成反帝反封建的革命事业。孙中山先生在建军方面发表的言论是很多的。归纳起来，有以下几点，值得我们重视：
    一，以主义建军　孙中山先生认为革命军应该有信仰，有信仰然后有力量，而当时革命军应该有的信仰就是三民主义。1924年2月23日孙中山先生曾说：“革命军的责任，是要把不平等的世界，打成平等的；能够明白打不平等的三民主义，才可以做革命军。革命军是为三民主义去奋斗的，为三民主义去牺牲的。”（“救国救民之责任在革命军”）大家知道，孙中山先生这时所说的三民主义，不是旧三民主义，而是新三民主义，也即是采取了联俄、联共、扶助农工三大政策的三民主义。这种三民主义在当时是进步的、革命的，也是当时的中国共产党人愿为之而奋斗的。孙中山先生当时对革命军尽力灌输新三民主义，提倡以主义建军，是有重大意义的。
    二，必须使武力成为国民的武力　孙中山先生认为武力与国民相结合，是建军的重要因素之一。在民国以后的军阀混战时代，军阀所有的军队，莫不是与帝国主义相结合的军队，他们受到帝国主义的指使，分裂国家，破坏和平和统一，孙中山先生对这种情形感到深恶痛绝，认为这种军队一定没有前途。他曾肯定地说：“凡武力与帝国主义结合者无不败，反之，与国民结合以速国民革命之进行者无不胜。今日以后，当划一国民革命之新时代，使武力与帝国主义结合之现象永绝迹于国内。其代之而兴之现象，第一步使武力与国民相结合，第二步使武力为国民之武力”（“北上宣言”）。在孙中山先生看来，保国卫民是军人的职责，如果武力不是与国民相结合的武力，而是与帝国主义相结合的武力，就一定不能履行军人保国卫民的神圣职责，而且还会出卖国家民族的利益。
    三，加强军人教育　孙中山先生认为：要使军队能担负起保国卫民的责任，就必须加强军人教育，使每一军人都能了解革命大义和自己所担负的光荣职责。他在桂林对滇粤赣军所作的讲演中曾说：“今在诸君之目前，有非常之事业，必待非常之军人以成之。诸君欲身任非常之事业，则必受非常之教育乃可。此非常之教育为何？即军人之革命精神教育是也。”（“军人精神教育”）孙中山先生并以革命的三民主义和智、仁、勇、决心等作为军人精神教育的内容。同时他也十分强调物质教育。在“十年国防计划”纲目中，他曾列有“军人精神教育与物质教育之比较”一条，主张二者必须同时注意，强调现代化的军队必须有现代化的科学技术来充实。孙中山先生深感我国物质科学技术落后，因而常遭科学技术水平高的帝国主义国家侵略，他曾大声疾呼地号召革命军人和全国人民在这方面向西方国家急起直追。
    四，健全军纪　孙中山先生把军纪看做是军队的命脉，认为有军纪然后全军脉胳可上下连贯，并可充分发挥军队的战斗力。他常说旧时的中国像一盘散沙，大家只知有小我，而不知有大我，只知有家族和宗族，而不知有民族，因而他特别强调为了国家民族的自由，可以牺牲个人的自由，他对军人更要求做到这一点。曾说：“当军人能够牺牲自由，就能够服从命令，忠心报国，使国家有自由。”（“民权主义第二讲”）又说：“倘军人与官吏借口于共和与自由，破坏纪律，则国家机关，万不能统一。机关不能统一，则执事者无专责，势如一盘散沙，又何能为国民办事！是故所贵乎机关者，全在服从纪律”（“共和与自由之真谛”）。在同盟会时代和倒袁时代，孙中山先生都定有森严的军纪，例如在同盟会时代，孙中山先生对当时革命部队颁布的军律就有二十二条。如“降敌被获者杀”、“私通军情于敌者杀”、“强奸妇女者杀”、“焚杀良民者杀”、“私入良民家宅者罚”、“盗窃者罚”、“赌博者罚”、“吃鸦片者罚”、“勒索强买者论情抵罪”等等，都是十分严峻的。同时，孙中山先生也强调自觉地遵守军纪，他相信只要大家明白为革命的主义而奋斗，就会自觉地遵守纪律。
    五，实行精兵、裁兵与化兵为工的政策孙中山先生主张国防军应采取精兵主义，以提高军队素质，充实组织，健全战争指挥单位，更好地发挥战斗力。在“十年国防计划”纲目中，他就提出了“实施全国精兵政策”一条。同时，孙中山先生还主张当国家由战时转入平时的时候，应实行裁兵政策，以减轻国家军费的支出，达到精兵简政的目的。他并且主张裁兵应该与化兵为工的政策相结合。这样，既可避免裁兵后可能发生的失业现象，又可发展实业，增加国家收入。孙中山先生在晚年提倡和平统一中国的时候，对裁兵和化兵为工的政策，主张甚力。
    孙中山先生的建军思想，是他的国防思想的组成部分。当时在他看来，只有建立现代化的国防军，才能保国卫民，抵御侵略。而必须以他的建军思想为依据，才能建立他所理想的现代化国防军。所以，研究孙中山先生的国防思想，必须同时研究他的建军思想。
    第三，国防与民生相结合，而民生又是国防建设之母。这是孙中山先生的国防思想的另一重要特征。孙中山先生曾说：“人类要能够生存，就须有两件最大的事：第一件是保，第二件是养。保和养两件大事，是人类天天要做的。保就是自卫，……养就是觅食。这自卫和觅食，便是人类维持生存的两件大事。”（“民权主义第一讲”）按照孙中山先生的意思，人类在存在着国与国争的时候，一个国家要想独立生存，就必须有自卫的能力，也就是必须建立国防。孙中山先生又认为解决民生问题，首在解决“吃饭问题”。而所谓觅食，也就是解决“吃饭”问题。当然，民生问题不止是一个“吃饭”问题，孙中山先生在“建国大纲”第二条中指出：“建设之首要在民生。故对于全国人民之食衣住行四大需要，政府当与人民协力共谋农业之发展，以足民食；共谋织造之发展，以裕民衣；建筑大计划之各式屋舍，以乐民居；修治道路、运河，以利民行。”可见民生问题除了“吃饭”以外，还包括穿衣、住、行等需要在内。孙中山先生认为民生问题和国防问题是有密切关系的。民生愈充裕，国防力量就愈能强大，而国防力量愈强大，也就愈能保障民生的发展。因此，他认为二者必须互相结合，不能偏废。但他又认为民生是国防建设之母。所谓“足食足兵”，“民富而国强”，他是早就具有这种见解的。还在他早年写的“上李鸿章书”中，他就主张以“人能尽其才，地能尽其利，物能尽其用，货能畅其流”作为民富国强的手段。他说：“夫人能尽其才则百事兴，地能尽其利则民食足，物能尽其用则财力足，货能畅其流则财源裕。故曰：此四者，富强之大经，治国之大本也。四者既得，然后修我政理，宏我规模，治我军实，保我藩邦，欧州其能匹哉。”并说，如“不急于此四者，徒为坚船利炮之是务，是舍本而图末也。”（均见“上李鸿章书”）孙中山先生这种思想，实际上是反映了国防建设与经济建设的关系，认为两者必须互相结合，而经济建设又是国防建设的基础。他后来所写的“实业计划”一书，主要是着眼于经济建设，着眼于充实民生，但同时又适应着国防上的需要，贯穿了国防与民生相结合、国防建设与经济建设相结合的思想。如计划中关于河道海港的开辟，铁道中心网的建立，煤、铁等矿产的开采，士敏土厂、机械制造厂、造船厂、造车厂等的兴办，固然是着重于繁荣经济、充实民生，但也同时能够满足国防上的需要。又如所谓东方、北方、南方等大港，在平时固为商港，在战时即可成为军港；所谓东南、东北、西北、高原等铁路系统，在平时固然是货财转运的纽带，在战时即可成为国防战略上军队集散的孔道。此外，在“十年国防计划”纲目中，孙中山先生也特别列有“国防与实业计划之关系”一条。可见他始终是不主张脱离民生、脱离经济建设而片面地强调国防建设的。
    以上我们简单地、远非完备地介绍了孙中山先生的国防思想的轮廓。我们知道，孙中山先生是一个伟大的、彻底的爱国主义者和民主主义者，在半殖民地半封建旧中国条件下，凡是真正的爱国主义者和民主主义者，就必须举起反帝反封建的旗帜。正因为孙中山先生高举了这一旗帜，他才能在晚年看得出国际工人阶级和我国工人阶级的强大革命力量，才勇于宣布与苏俄联盟，与中国共产党合作，并决心依靠这种力量来反抗帝国主义的强大势力，求得革命的胜利和国防的巩固。
    也正因为孙中山先生是勇敢地、坚决地站在反对帝国主义的立场上，他的国防思想也就能够符合当时的民族利益和人民利益，并且能够作为一份宝贵的遗产留给我们来学习。当然，由于历史条件的变化，我们学习孙中山先生的国防思想时，是应该用发展的观点来理解问题的。例如，孙中山先生当时强调从民族本性来说明我们热爱和平，反对侵略，而今天我们却应该从社会主义制度的本性来说明这一点。又如，孙中山先生当时强调用三民主义来教育军人，而我们今天则应该强调用马克思列宁主义，用社会主义和共产主义来教育我们的国防战士。不过，不管历史条件怎样变化，孙中山先生的国防思想还是会永远放着灿烂的光辉的。因为他建设国防的目的是保卫国家，保卫人民的生活，是反抗压迫者，反抗侵略强权，而这正代表了世界亿万劳动人民和被压迫民族的共同心愿。现在，帝国主义还存在，帝国主义侵略我国的威胁还存在，帝国主义侵略弱小民族的事实更是严重地存在着，学习孙中山先生的国防思想，从中吸取教益，不是没有现实意义的。
    中国人民在中国共产党的领导下，继承并大大发展了孙中山先生建设国防的伟大理想，中国人民的武装力量，已经给予帝国主义者以沉重的打击，现在，中国人民拥有的国防武装力量是更加强大了。孙中山先生假使能够看到这种情形的话，将是怎样高兴啊！惟有留在台湾的那些孙中山先生的不肖门徒们，他们勾结帝国主义，仇视革命人民，完全背弃了孙中山先生的国防理想，直到今天，还没有把枪口转向帝国主义，使祖国完成孙中山先生所渴望的和平统一的大业。假使他们愿意乘着纪念孙中山先生诞辰的机会，重温一下孙中山先生的国防思想，实在应该有所悔悟吧。
