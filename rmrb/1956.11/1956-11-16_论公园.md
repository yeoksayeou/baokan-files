　　On Parks
　　Wu Huansun
　　I was lingering alone under the newly built Paifang (ceremonial gate) of Taoranting Park, when I suddenly heard someone singing casually. The words of the song were quite strange: "Strolling in the park is like walking the road, a flat avenue with two rows of trees."

　　Another day, I was taking a walk with a friend along the Jishuitan Lake, admiring the scenery of the Jingye Lake after dredging. I felt that it was more tidy but lacked the natural wildness compared to before. A student was leaning on the railing, looking at the water, and shouted to his companion, "Look, the lake looks like a swimming pool, with straight embankments all around."

　　Pondering these words made me quite thoughtful. I remembered that in the past, when building gardens and pavilions, the key to attracting people was winding paths leading to secluded spots, and dense flowers and trees. What was avoided was "revealing everything at a glance." As for building ponds and diverting streams, the emphasis was on small bridges and flowing water, meandering and curved. People strolling through them were delighted by the clear water and shallow sand, where fish could be counted. It was not about large lakes and ponds, a vast expanse of water, because that would not be lovable; sometimes, standing beside the embankment, one would often be afraid of accidentally falling into the water and becoming fearful.

　　The arrangement of garden scenery is a specialized subject. Li Yu, with the alias Liweng, from the early Qing Dynasty, was an outstanding master in this field. He believed that arranging a garden was like painting a picture. Where to pile up mountains and where to dig caves required having a clear picture in mind and being good at managing the placement. Planting trees must have varying densities, deliberately making them uneven in height and gracefully leaning, in order to have a wild, natural feel. It was essential to avoid neat rows and aligned formations. The best arrangement for pavilions, terraces, and towers was to be half-hidden and half-visible. The ingenuity of digging lotus ponds and fish ponds lay in their twists and turns. He also believed that painting emphasized large strokes and careful finishing; building gardens emphasized large-scale scenery and adding interest in small details. A master of garden arrangement would exert his ingenuity, especially in the finer points, making every flower and tree worthy of appreciation, having value that made people linger and reluctant to leave; every stone and slope would have a good place to rest.

　　Let us measure the newly built parks and renovated scenic spots in Beijing with these words. I feel that most of them only make arrangements in neat rows, without putting effort or thought into increasing the interest for visitors.

　　Speaking of the renovation of various parks, it also only focuses on the big picture, without delving into the details. The surface of the towers, pavilions, and halls is repainted and refurbished. However, in terms of the mountain peaks, water edges, paths, and tree sides, where bamboo fences should be woven, where thatched pavilions should be built, where wooden flower stands can be constructed, and where stakes can be erected to build riverside houses, to increase the wildness of the garden, and at the same time, under the fences and flower stands, plant more creeping plants such as Ficus pumila, wisteria, Campsis grandiflora, roses, Gleditsia sinensis, double cherry blossoms, Ardisia crenata, and climbing plants. It can be said that very little has been done in this regard. If we were to start in this direction, it would not cost much, and it would also allow visitors to have seats by the water and under the trees to rest; and to have pavilions on the mountain peaks and slopes to have a distant view. Three or five close friends could take this opportunity to have heart-to-heart talks; and couples could also take advantage of this to say their love shoulder to shoulder. In the event of a summer rainstorm, there would be no need to worry about becoming a "drenched chicken." In the winter, when strong winds blow, there would be no need to worry about becoming a "blinded deer." After adding these facilities, the majority of visitors can immediately change from walking the park or running the park to sitting in the park or resting in the park. In the Xuanwu Lake Park in Nanjing, I saw that they built many bamboo houses and bamboo corridors, which are both economical and elegant, and the parks in the north can learn from this.

　　In terms of developing the national architectural style, people in the past always liked to surround the ponds in gardens with painted railings and carved decorations to protect the scenery. In ancient paintings, such elegant embellishments are often depicted, making people wish they could step into the painting to enjoy this beautiful environment. However, when visiting parks and scenic spots recently, not only can we not see such antique installations, but what we see are cement stakes wrapped with iron bars and barbed wire, or iron chains and iron fences, giving people the feeling of imprisoning the scenery, shackling the rivers and mountains, distrusting visitors, and guarding against newcomers. Nothing is more destructive to the scenery than this. Such eye-piercing and prickly measures, not only in the north and south, but parks and scenic spots everywhere have turned tourist attractions into battlefields, imitating each other. Even the beautiful West Lake has not been spared, planting these things that are neither Chinese nor Western. Now that parks and scenic spots are to truly serve the masses of the people, please pay attention to this point and no longer suffer the complaints of "distrusting visitors." As mentioned earlier, to achieve that every tree and stone can be lingered over, here I say again that every railing and brick must also be embellished to add color. Since it is a Chinese park, it should everywhere develop the Chinese architectural style. Since it is a Chinese scenic spot, it should in every way mark the characteristics of national art.

　　Why do parks renovated and scenic spots reorganized in recent years still have installations that are neither Chinese nor Western, and architecture that is completely Westernized? What should be pointed out is that only the designs of architects have been adopted, and the need to invite some artists and painters to help with the landscaping and beautification embellishments has been overlooked. This is an issue that should be raised.

    论公园
    吴幻荪
    我在新建的陶然亭公园的牌楼下面，正独自徘徊的时候，忽听得有人信口在歌唱。歌唱的言辞好生奇怪：“逛公园好像遛马路，一马平川的大道两排树。”
    又一天，我同朋友在积水潭畔散步，欣赏疏浚后的净业湖风光，感到比起从前是整洁有余、野趣不足了。有一个学生正在凭栏观水，喊叫他的同伴说：“你看湖里好像游泳池，四下泊岸砌笔直。”
    玩味这几句话，使我颇有所思。想起从前，起造园林，修建亭榭，引人入胜，端在曲径通幽，花木扶疏，忌的是：“一览无余，一目了然”。至于开筑陂塘，掘引细流，是讲究小桥流水，曲曲弯弯。人们徜徉其间，喜的是水清沙浅，游鱼可数。而不是大块湖塘，一片汪洋，那样就不可爱了；有时侧足堤旁，常恐失足溺水，望而生畏了。
    关于园庭景致的布置，是一种专门的学问。清初的李渔字笠翁，就是一位出色的名家。他曾认为，布置园林犹如作画，何处堆山，何处凿洞，必须胸有丘壑，善于经营位置。栽种树木，必须有疏密参差，故意使之高低不齐，偃蹇多姿，才有野生的情趣，切忌行列整齐，排成队伍。安排亭阁楼台，最好半隐半现。开凿莲池鱼沼，妙在曲折回环。他还认为，作画讲究大处落墨，小心收拾；建园讲究大处置景，小处添趣。一位园林布置的好手，越是在细微地方，越讲匠心独运。使得一花一木，皆堪玩赏，有令人留连不忍离去的价值；一石一坡，皆有可以憩坐的好处。
    我们拿这些话来衡量北京新建的公园和重葺的风景区吧。我觉得，大都只在整齐行列上作出安排，却没在为游人增加情趣上费过经营，下过思考。
    谈起各公园的修缮呢，也是光在大处着眼，没有在细致方面去琢磨入手，把表面的楼台殿阁油漆彩画一新。可是对于山巅水涯、路间树旁，哪里宜编竹为篱，哪里宜结茅为亭，某处可构木为花架，某处可栽桩立河屋，来增加园中的野趣，同时在篱落花架之下，多栽薜荔、藤萝、凌霄、蔷薇、皂荚、十姊妹、珊瑚豆、爬蔓的植物。对这方面，可以说是做到很少。如果在这方面着手，花费既不多，还可以使游人在水边林下有了坐位，可以休息；在山巅坡上有了亭榭，可以远眺。三五知己，借此可以促膝谈心；对对情侣，也利此可以并肩说爱。夏遇暴雨，无须耽心作“落汤鸡”。冬值狂风，无须顾虑成“迷眼鹿”。添了这些设备以后，马上可使多数的游人由遛公园、跑公园，变成坐公园、歇公园了。我在南京玄武湖公园，看到他们多作竹屋竹廊，又经济、又雅致，北地公园是可以取以为法的。
    在发挥民族建筑风格上，从前的人总喜欢在园林陂塘之间，围以画栏，绕以雕砌，来珍护景致。在古画上，常常画出这样雅致的点缀，叫人看了以后，就有着恨不得走入画中去享受这种美丽环境的念头。可是近来游览公园和风景区，岂止看不到这样古香古色的装置，看到的多是用水泥作桩，缠绕上铁条蒺藜，或者拦以铁链，遮以铁槛，叫人看了，有囚禁景色、枷锁河山、刺嫌游人、戒防来者的感觉。大杀风景，莫此为甚。这样刺目扎手的措施，不但南南北北，各地公园风景区，把游览胜地变成疆场，此行彼效，就是美丽的西子湖滨，也未能免俗，栽上这不中不西的东西。现在的公园和风景区，既然要做到真正为人民群众服务，请注意这一点，不要再遭受“刺嫌游人”的抱怨。前面谈过，要做到一树一石，皆可流连，这里再说，一栏一砌也须点缀生色。既然是中国人的公园，就该处处发挥中国建筑风格。既然是中国的风景区，就该般般标志出民族美术上的特色。
    为什么近来修葺的公园和整理的风景区，还存在着不中不西的装置，和全盘洋化的建筑？应该指出的是：只采取了建筑师的设计，而忽略了还需请一些美术家和画家，帮助在置景上、美化点缀上，一同作出经营，这是一个应该提出来的问题。
