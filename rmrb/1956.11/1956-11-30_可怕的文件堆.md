    Terrible Pile of Documents
  　Mao Qida
    A manager of a county company under the Hunan Provincial Textile Products Company said that he has to read more than twenty kinds of official documents and a lot of internal publications every day. Among them, the central government organs issue "Commercial Work", "Trade Learning", "Document Compilation", "Statistical Work Newsletter", "Market Weekly"; the provincial organs issue "Hunan Trade Newsletter", "Weekly Work Briefing", "Briefing on Promoting Property Management Responsibility System", "Transformation Briefing", "Statistical Work Newsletter", "Supply Work Ten-day Report", "Plan Execution Inspection"; the special district branch company issues "Ten-day Work Report", "Secretarial Work Newsletter", "Statistical Text Analysis", "Plan Execution Inspection"; and the county company itself compiles "Work Five-Day Report", "Transformation Briefing", "Plan Execution Inspection", "Statistical Text Analysis", etc. There are also Party (or Youth League) documents and inter-office documents.
    So many documents and publications are a headache for a business leader. If you don't read them, the higher-ups criticize you for "not paying attention," and various departments complain that "the leadership emphasizes some things over others and does not support the business of this department"; if you read them all, the leader will be trapped in a pile of documents all day and will not be able to do anything.
    In fact, the content of many documents and publications is often repetitive and can be merged, and some can be eliminated altogether. For example, the Ministry of Commerce's "Commercial Work" and "Trade Learning", "Document Compilation" and "Market Weekly" can be merged and adapted into two types. Because the former two are general publications, and the latter two are internal guiding documents. Some local publications such as "Hunan Trade Newsletter", "Situation Briefing", "Peak Season Situation Briefing", etc., are of the same nature and can be completely merged without being published separately.
    Merging these repetitive and poor-content publications has many benefits: it can reduce bureaucracy in organs and enterprises, so that enterprise leaders are not trapped in piles of documents; it reduces official correspondence and transfer procedures, which can streamline institutions and save costs; the number of documents and publications is reduced, and the content will be enriched, while also saving a lot of paper for the country.

    可怕的文件堆
  　毛启达
    湖南省纺织品公司某县公司的一位经理说，他每天要看二十多种公文和不少的内部刊物。其中中央机关发的有“商业工作”、“贸易学习”、“文件汇编”、“统计工作通讯”、“市场一周”；省级机关发的有“湖南贸易通讯”、“一周工作简报”、“推行财产管理责任制简报”、“改造简报”、“计统工作通讯”、“供应工作旬报”、“计划执行检查”；专区分公司发的有“一旬工作报”、“秘书工作通讯”、“统计文字分析”、“计划执行检查”；县公司本身编的有“工作五日报”、“改造简报”、“计划执行检查”、“统计文字分析”等。其它还有党内（或团内）文件、机关往来文件。
    这样多的文件、刊物，对一个企业领导干部来说是很头痛的。不看吧，上级批评“不重视”，各部门反映“领导重彼轻此，对这部门业务不支持”；全看吧，就会把一个领导人整天围困在文件堆里什么事情也干不成了。
    其实，有好多文件、刊物的内容经常是重复的，可以把它合并起来，有些可以不要。例如：商业部出版的“商业工作”同“贸易学习”，“文件汇编”同“市场一周”，就可以合并改编为两种。因为前两者都是一般性刊物，后两种都是内部指导性文件。一些地方性的刊物如“湖南贸易通讯”、“情况简报”、“旺季情况简编”等，性质都相同，完全可以合并，不必分开出版。
    这些内容重复、贫乏的刊物合并了，有很多好处：可以减少机关、企业的文牍主义，使企业领导干部不至老困在文件堆里；减少了公文往来和传递手续，从而可以精简机构，节省费用；文件、刊物的数量少了，内容就会丰富，同时也可以为国家节约大量纸张。
