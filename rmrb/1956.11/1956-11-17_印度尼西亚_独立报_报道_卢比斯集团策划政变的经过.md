Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, November 16th: The Jakarta "People's Daily" reported on November 15th that, according to sources close to the military, Colonel Lubis, the former Deputy Chief of Staff of the Army, who recently defied the summons of the Indonesian Army Chief of Staff, had been plotting a coup.

The "Independent Newspaper" of the same day reported the details of this coup plot. The "Independent Newspaper" said that the aim of several army officers attempting to launch this coup was to overthrow the current Sastroamidjojo cabinet, hold President Sukarno hostage, exclude several political leaders, and also overthrow the leaders of the Army, Navy, and Air Force who were unwilling to side with their group, as well as change the country's ideological foundation. This plan to seize power was decided through consultations between some officers of the Army Headquarters and the West Java garrison, and the plan was supported by some leaders of political parties that did not win in the general election. They planned to create public unrest by first conducting psychological warfare through two newspapers in Jakarta.

The "Independent Newspaper" also revealed that these officers had originally planned to achieve their goal of seizing power on August 13th this year when arresting Foreign Minister Abdulgani, and intended to refuse to hand over the command of the Third Military Region. The order to arrest Abdulgani was signed by Colonel Kawilarang, the former commander of the Third Military Region, who has now been transferred to the position of military attaché at the Indonesian Embassy in the United States. They also planned to conduct another operation before October 5th, and hoped to fully realize their goals by about mid-October.

However, all their plans failed because the entire army, under the leadership of Army Chief of Staff Major General Nasution, took timely preventive measures.

On October 20th, the Army Headquarters held a meeting of the commanders of various military regions and the heads of various departments. The result of the meeting was to condemn any kind of coup and illegal action, while on the other hand, to continue the fight against corruption, and to avoid the risky actions that a few officers hoped to take.

Subsequently, Nasution and his staff quickly took some preventive measures. On November 7th, he summoned Colonel Lubis, Colonel Saphari, and Colonel Bratamengala. At the same time, the commander of the Third Military Region and the heads of various regiments under his command also took some steps to maintain the unity of the "Siliwangi Division" (this division is stationed in the Third Military Region). Colonel Saphari and Colonel Bratamengala reported immediately, they were disciplined and not allowed to contact the outside world. However, Colonel Lubis did not appear and his whereabouts are now unknown. It is said that he is still in Jakarta. He is now accused of violating military criminal law and violating military discipline.

The "Independent Newspaper" said that people in the military have fully realized that foreign subversives will take advantage of every opportunity for accidents occurring in the Indonesian army.

    印度尼西亚“独立报”报道
    卢比斯集团策划政变的经过
    据新华社雅加达16日电　雅加达“人民日报”11月15日报道，据接近军队方面的人士说，最近违抗印度尼西亚陆军参谋长传询的前陆军副参谋长卢比斯上校曾经筹划发动政变。
    同一天的“独立报”详细地报道了这个政变阴谋的经过。“独立报”说，若干陆军军官企图发动这个政变的目的，是要推翻现在的沙斯特罗阿米佐约内阁，挟持苏加诺总统，排斥若干政治领袖，同时还要推翻不愿倒向他们的集团的陆、海、空军领导人，以及改变国家的思想基础。这个夺取政权的计划是陆军总部和西爪哇驻军中的一些军官洽商决定的，而这个计划得到那些在普选中没有取得胜利的政党的若干领袖的支持。他们计划先通过雅加达两家报纸进行心理战，来制造公众的骚乱。
    “独立报”还揭露说，这些军官本来预定在今年8月13日逮捕外交部长阿卜杜加尼时实现夺取政权的目的，并且打算拒绝办理第三军区司令的移交手续。签署命令逮捕阿卜杜加尼的是前第三军区司令卡维拉朗上校，他现在已经调任印度尼西亚驻美国大使馆武官。他们还打算在10月5日前夕再进行一次行动，并且希望大约在10月中旬全部实现他们的目的。
    但是，他们的一切计划都失败了，因为在陆军参谋长纳苏蒂安少将领导下的全军及时采取了预防性的措施。
    10月20日，陆军总部举行了各军区的司令和各部门首长的会议。会议的结果是谴责任何种类的政变和非法行动，同时在另一方面也继续同贪污作斗争，要避免少数军官希望采取的冒险行动。
    接着，纳苏蒂安和他的参谋本部迅速采取了一些预防措施。他在11月7日召见卢比斯上校、沙帕里上校和布腊塔门加拉上校。同时，第三军区司令和他属下的各团团长也采取了一些步骤，维持“西利万吉师”（这个师驻在第三军区）的团结。沙帕里上校和布腊塔门加拉随即报到，他们受到了纪律处分，并且不许和外界联系。但是卢比斯上校却没有出现，现在不知躲在何处。据说，他还在雅加达城内。他现在被控违犯军事刑事法和违反军队纪律。
    “独立报”说，陆军界人士已经充分认识到，外国颠复分子是会利用印度尼西亚陆军中发生事故的每一个机会的。
