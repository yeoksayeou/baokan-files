Xinhua News Agency, London, November 1st. The British people are demanding an immediate end to the British-French aggression against Egypt.

    The National Executive Committee of the British Labour Party and the International Committee of the Trades Union Congress General Council have both decided to hold a special meeting on November 1st regarding the government's actions of aggression against Egypt.

    The Socialist Medical Association has called for all measures, including a general strike if necessary, to save peace. The Sheffield District Committee of the Amalgamated Engineering Union has called on engineering workers to hold a general strike.

    The Suez Canal Emergency Committee, supported by the British Peace Committee, has announced that a mass rally will be held in Trafalgar Square on the afternoon of November 4th.

    The Peace Committee is also calling on the people to meet with Members of Parliament and calling for rallies and demonstrations throughout the country.

    The First District Committee of the Transport and General Workers' Union, representing 363,000 bus workers, dockworkers, truck drivers, and other workers, has expressed "deep concern" about the situation created by the government.

    The Democratic Control League demands the withdrawal of British troops and also demands the resignation of the government.

Xinhua News Agency, November 1st. According to TASS, Paris: The French people oppose the French government's military intervention in Egypt.

    On the evening of October 30th, a delegation of youth representatives from eleven districts of Paris went to the National Assembly and unanimously expressed their firm protest against dealing with Egypt by military means.

    Railway employees at the Gare de l'Est in Paris passed a resolution condemning the government's policy of military intervention in Middle Eastern affairs and handed the resolution to members of the National Assembly. Railway employees in Paris-Lyon also sent a telegram to the Mollet government protesting against the military intervention in Egypt.

    Trade union organizations of the working people in the 15th arrondissement of Paris and participants in the Resistance Movement in the former 10th arrondissement of the French capital also condemned the French government's policy in the Near East.

    Some democratic newspapers in France have also criticized the government's aggressive policies. "Libération" emphasized: "How can one imagine that the French government, especially a socialist government, has fallen to such a point: engaging in this adventure whose consequences could be a new and terrible bloodshed."

    Many newspapers, such as "L'Echo de Paris" and "Franc-Tireur," have openly pointed out that Britain and France encouraged Israeli troops to invade Egypt to create an opportunity for them to "settle accounts" with Egypt.

Xinhua News Agency, London, November 1st. Some journalists here have severely criticized the British-French plan to retake the Suez Canal by force. At a press conference at noon on October 31st, reporters raised many sharp questions with the Foreign Office spokesman about the government's dangerous policies. For example, one reporter asked if the British government was a fascist government.

    The "Manchester Guardian" published an editorial on October 31st criticizing the government's policy, saying that the British-French ultimatum to Egypt was a "foolish action, unreasonable no matter how you look at it." The newspaper said that the military action threatened in the ultimatum, if implemented, "would be a blatant act of aggression."
