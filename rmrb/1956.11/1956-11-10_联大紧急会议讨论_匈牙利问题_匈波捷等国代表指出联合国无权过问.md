Xinhua News Agency, New York, 9th Dispatch: An emergency meeting of the United Nations General Assembly was held on November 8th to discuss the "Hungarian situation." This issue was forced upon the Security Council and the General Assembly by the United States, Britain, and France in violation of the UN Charter. Their purpose is to divert world attention from the imperialist aggression against Egypt, to heighten international tensions, and to intensify incitement of secret reactionary forces to engage in activities against the governments of the People's Democratic countries.

According to the rules of procedure, the Hungarian representative, Szabo, spoke at the meeting. He opposed the discussion of the "Hungarian question" because such a discussion constitutes a gross interference in the internal affairs of the Hungarian People's Republic. Szabo read out a telegram from the Hungarian Revolutionary Worker-Peasant Government to the UN Secretary-General, strongly protesting the discussion of this issue in the Security Council or in the General Assembly.

The President of the General Assembly said that he had taken note of the Hungarian representative's statement, but since the issue had been placed on the agenda, he would give representatives the opportunity to state their reasons for voting on the American proposal adopted by the General Assembly on November 4th.

Representatives from the Chiang Kai-shek clique, Cuba, Portugal, the Netherlands, Uruguay, and other countries slandered the Hungarian People's Republic and the Soviet Union. The Chiang Kai-shek clique and the Cuban representative openly complained that the colonial powers' tactic of diverting attention had failed, and they also complained that representatives from Asian and Arab countries were not enthusiastic about discussing the "Hungarian question."

Representatives from Bulgaria, Albania, Romania, and Poland firmly opposed the discussion of the "Hungarian question."

The Romanian representative, Joza, said that the American proposal adopted by the General Assembly on November 4th aimed at inciting fascists to carry out subversive activities against the legitimate government of the Hungarian People's Republic.

The Yugoslav representative, Brilej, emphasized that some people were attempting to restore the pre-World War II system in Hungary. He said that the Nagy government was unable to control the domestic situation and allowed anarchy to develop, so certain elements seized the opportunity to act.

He went on to say that conditions now exist in Hungary that allow the people of that country to continue on the path of democratic and socialist construction.

Brilej finally emphasized that the American proposal "does not point out a way to improve the situation in Hungary," although there are several points in the proposal that his delegation could vote in favor of if the proposal were put to a separate vote.

The Czechoslovak representative, Ulih, said that there are "unresolved problems and great difficulties" in Hungary, which should be resolved according to the will of the Hungarian people. However, the resolution of these problems is an internal affair of Hungary. UN interference in Hungary's internal affairs is a violation of the Charter.

The representative of the Ukrainian Republic, Sapozhnikov, emphasized that the UN General Assembly's discussion of the "Hungarian question" is in no way in line with the purposes of the United Nations. The slanderous remarks made by the representatives of the United States, Britain, and France in the UN General Assembly can only be regarded as an attempt to incite new subversive activities aimed at overthrowing the socialist system in Hungary.

The representative of the Ukrainian Republic concluded by saying that the American proposal of November 4th is an intolerable interference in Hungary's internal affairs.

The Indonesian representative, Sugao, said that hastily convening an emergency meeting of the UN General Assembly to discuss the "Hungarian question" is only beneficial to "certain delegations."

The Italian representative, Vitteti, made slanderous remarks and, on behalf of Italy, Cuba, Ireland, Pakistan, and Peru, put forward a proposal that was merely a replica of the American proposal adopted by the General Assembly on November 4th. He said that he also intended to submit a proposal to send a "UN police force" to Hungary.

The Spanish representative, de Krica, suggested sending Spanish soldiers to Hungary under the banner of the United Nations.

The Indian representative, Menon, emphasized that the Indian government opposes any foreign interference in Hungary's internal affairs.

The meeting adjourned at this point. The next meeting is scheduled to be held on November 9th.

    联大紧急会议讨论“匈牙利问题”
    匈波捷等国代表指出联合国无权过问
    新华社9日讯　据塔斯社纽约讯：联合国大会11月8日召开紧急会议，讨论“匈牙利局势”问题。这个问题是美、英、法三国在违背联合国宪章的情况下强迫安全理事会和联合国大会讨论的，其目的在于转移世界舆论对埃及遭受帝国主义侵略的注意，使国际局势紧张和加紧煽动秘密反动势力从事反对人民民主国家政府的活动。
    根据议事规则，匈牙利代表萨波在会上发了言。他反对会议讨论“匈牙利问题”，因为这种讨论是对匈牙利人民共和国内政的粗暴干涉。萨波宣读了匈牙利人民共和国工农革命政府给联合国秘书长的电报，坚决抗议在安全理事会或者在联合国大会上讨论这个问题。
    大会主席说，他已经注意到匈牙利代表的声明，但是，既然问题已经列入议程，他给代表们以机会就大会11月4日通过的美国提案表明自己的投票理由。
    蒋介石分子、古巴、葡萄牙、荷兰、乌拉圭等国代表对匈牙利人民共和国和苏联进行诬蔑。蒋介石分子和古巴代表公开抱怨殖民国家转移视线的把戏陷于失败，他们还抱怨亚洲国家和阿拉伯国家的代表对讨论“匈牙利问题”一点也不热心。
    保加利亚、阿尔巴尼亚、罗马尼亚和波兰的代表坚决反对讨论“匈牙利问题”。
    罗马尼亚代表若扎说，大会11月4日通过的美国提案，其目的是怂恿法西斯分子对匈牙利人民共和国合法政府进行颠复活动。
    南斯拉夫代表布里列伊强调指出，有人企图在匈牙利恢复第二次世界大战前的制度。他说，纳吉政府没有能力控制国内的局面，听任形成无政府状态，于是某些分子就乘机活动。
    他接着说，现在匈牙利有了这样一种条件，使这个国家的人民可以继续在民主和社会主义建设的道路前进。
    布里列伊最后强调指出，美国的提案“没有指出使匈牙利局势好转的途径”，虽然提案中有几点是他的代表团可以投票赞成的，如果这个提案分段表决的话。
    捷克斯洛伐克代表乌里赫说，在匈牙利存在着“尚未解决的问题和很大的困难”，这些都应该根据匈牙利人民的意志加以解决。但是这些问题的解决是匈牙利的内部事务。联合国干涉匈牙利的内政是违背宪章的。
    乌克兰共和国代表萨波日尼科夫强调指出，联合国大会讨论“匈牙利问题”，是同联合国的宗旨丝毫不相符合的。美英法三国代表在联合国大会上的诽谤言论只能被认为是想煽动起企图推翻匈牙利社会主义制度的新的颠复活动。
    乌克兰共和国代表最后说，11月4日的美国提案是对匈牙利内政不可容忍的干涉。
    印度尼西亚代表苏加沃说，匆匆忙忙召开联合国大会紧急会议来讨论“匈牙利问题”，这仅仅对“某些代表团”有利。
    意大利代表维特提发表了诽谤性的言论，并且代表意大利、古巴、爱尔兰、巴基斯坦和秘鲁提出一项提案，这项提案只不过是11月4日联大所通过的美国提案的翻版。他说，他还打算再提出一项规定派遣“联合国警察部队”到匈牙利去的提案。
    西班牙代表德克里卡建议派遣西班牙士兵打着联合国的旗帜到匈牙利去。
    印度代表梅农强调指出，印度政府反对外国对匈牙利内政作任何干涉。
    会议到此休会。下次会议订在11月9日举行。
