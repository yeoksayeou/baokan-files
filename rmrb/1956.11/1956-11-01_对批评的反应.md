Reactions to Criticism

    The CCP Committee of Hunyuan County, Shanxi Province, writes: We welcome and sincerely accept the criticism in Comrade Ma Chaojun's article "What are you busy with? What results have you achieved?" published on page four of the People's Daily on August 24th, which exposed shortcomings in our county's leadership style.
    Now, based on the "Resolution on Opposing Bureaucracy and Upholding the Mass Line" made by the First Congress of the Shanxi Provincial Party and in conjunction with the criticism raised against us in the Party newspaper, we have conducted discussions at the plenary session of the County Party Committee and conducted a review at an expanded cadre meeting. The discussion and criticism was made by the cadres of the whole county. Finally, various county-level units have put forward specific measures based on the County Party Committee's review and suggestions for improvement, and they are now being implemented throughout the county.
    The Salt Affairs Bureau of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Industry writes: The "three excesses" phenomenon in our bureau, which was published on the fourth page on August 14th, is true. Recently, we have drafted a "Plan for Streamlining Internal Organizations, Reducing Meetings, and Improving the Quality of Meetings" and it has been approved by the bureau affairs meeting and will be implemented from October.
    The plan stipulates that the original twenty-seven organizations will be reduced to eleven, and the members of each organization will be reduced from seven to nine to five to seven, or even fewer. At the same time, consideration is also given to comrades who are usually busy with work or engaged in technical work, exempting them from social part-time jobs so that they have ample time to arrange their own studies and rest. The plan also puts forward more specific measures to reduce meetings and improve the quality of meetings.

专栏：对批评的反应

    对批评的反应
    中共山西浑源县委会来信：8月24日人民日报第四版发表了马超骏同志所写的“忙什么？忙出了什么结果”一文，文章中揭发了我县领导作风上存在的缺点，我们对这一批评表示欢迎和诚恳接受。
    现在我们根据党的山西省第一次代表大会所作的“关于反对官僚主义，坚持群众路线的决议”结合党报上对我们提出的批评，在全体县委会上进行了讨论，并在扩大干部会上进行了检查，由全县干部作了讨论批评，最后县级各单位根据县委的检查和改进意见，提出了具体措施。现已在全县贯彻执行。
    江苏省工业厅盐务管理局来信：8月14日第四版刊登的我局存在“三多”现象是真实的。最近已拟订了“精简内部组织，减少会议，提高会议质量的方案”并经局务会议通过，从10月份起实行。
    方案中规定将原有二十七个组织裁并为十一个，每个组织的成员从七到九人，减少为五到七人，或者更少一些。同时还照顾到平时工作较忙的或担任技术工作的同志，免除了他们的社会兼职，使他们有充裕的时间来安排自己的学习和休息，方案对减少会议，提高会议质量也提出了较具体的措施。
