    Arabic Proverbs
    A cat catches mice not for the sake of worshipping God.
    As long as they live together sincerely, even a needle's eye is more than enough for two friends.
    A true person can make bread from stones.
    An ashtray and a rich man are exactly the same: the fuller, the dirtier.
    When crows lead the people, they will lead them to piles of dead dog meat.
    If anyone insists on treating a lion as a donkey, let him try to ride it.

    烟灰碟和大财主一模一样：越满越脏。
    当乌鸦引导着人民时，它们就会把人民领到死狗肉堆去。
    谁要是硬把狮子当成驴，那就让他去试着骑一骑。
