Congratulatory Telegram from the Secretary-General of the Council of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association to Commemorate the 39th Anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution

Respected Comrade Denisov:

On the occasion of the 39th anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution, on behalf of all members the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, I extend to you, and through you, to all the Soviet people our most sincere and warmest congratulations.

Over the past thirty-nine years, the Soviet Union has grown stronger and stronger. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Soviet people have completed the great socialist construction and are advancing towards the glorious road to the victory of communism. The magnificent plan for building communism formulated by the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union has greatly inspired the Chinese people and peace-loving people all over the world. The Chinese people fully realize that the further development and strengthening of the Soviet Union is of great significance for striving for lasting world peace, for the cause of human progress, and for our country's socialist construction.

During this great festival, the head office of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and its branches in various places will widely hold celebration activities, and will concentrate on conducting propaganda related to Sino-Soviet friendship to the Chinese people through various forms (such as photo exhibitions, report meetings, symposiums, reports on visits to the Soviet Union, etc.). In each of the central municipalities, the cities where the provincial capitals are located, and the capitals of the autonomous regions, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association will hold celebration meetings, inviting representatives from all walks of life, Soviet friends, and experts from fraternal countries to participate; the Beijing celebration meeting is scheduled to be held on November 6, and will be jointly organized by the head office of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and the Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association. Joint celebration activities will also be held in agencies, schools, factories, and enterprises with Soviet experts. Before and after the festival, the "People's Daily" will publish an editorial, and radio stations across the country and newspapers in various provinces and important cities will report on the celebration activities and publish commemorative articles. On November 7, the Ministry of Culture of the People's Republic of China and the head office of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association will jointly hold "Soviet Film Week" in twenty important cities in our country. In addition, the Chinese People's Liberation Army will also hold celebration activities.

May the eternal, unbreakable brotherly friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people be increasingly consolidated and developed.
