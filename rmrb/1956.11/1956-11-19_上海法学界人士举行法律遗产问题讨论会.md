Shanghai Legal Scholars Hold Discussion on Legal Legacy

Shanghai legal scholars recently held a discussion on the issue of legal legacy. The discussion was convened by the editorial department of the "Journal of East China University of Political Science and Law." The journal recently published two articles in its second issue by Li Liang and Liu Huanwen, who argued that old China had a rich legal legacy that could be absorbed. These articles have attracted the attention of legal scholars throughout the city.

Li Liang and Liu Huanwen, who have been engaged in legal work for more than 20 years, argue that there is an intrinsic connection between new and old legal thought. For example, certain new legal concepts such as socialist public ownership and the punishment of counter-revolutionaries already existed in the old society. The new laws' litigation procedures and prison systems also reject the reactionary side of old legal thought while enriching the new content. They believe that acknowledging this connection does not negate or diminish the class nature of the new legal science.

Most legal scholars at the discussion agreed with this view, and many cited ancient legal works, especially believing that the Tang Dynasty's laws were representative of China's past legal codes, with many useful contents that could be absorbed. Participants were also very interested in the "Washing Away of Wrongs," a forensic science book from the Song Dynasty six hundred years ago, which was a legal treatise distinguishing between natural death and homicide. Scholars such as Yu Chengxiu, who have studied this treatise, cited examples to illustrate that it contained many scientific experiences in legal examination.

At the meeting, Hong Wenlan, a retired law professor, and some young legal workers believed that the ideas of the old laws were the ideas of the exploiting classes. They can be studied and criticized, but cannot be absorbed as a legacy to enrich the ideological content of the new laws. What can be absorbed should only be certain forms of the old legal system and technical experience such as forensic medicine.

The discussion lasted six hours. The more than 30 legal workers present unanimously agreed that the study of law should keep up with other sciences in the future, vigorously implement the "Hundred Schools of Thought" policy, and in particular, on the important issue of how to treat the legal legacy of the motherland, continue to boldly carry out in-depth research and discussion, so that China's legal science can also blossom in the cause of socialist construction. The meeting also discussed how legal workers can strengthen their Marxist-Leninist cultivation, and how to vigorously collect, sort out, and utilize legal books and materials from ancient and modern times, both domestic and foreign.

### 上海法学界人士举行法律遗产问题讨论会

    上海法学界人士举行法律遗产问题讨论会
    上海法学界人士最近举行了一次法律遗产问题的讨论会。讨论会由华东政法学院学报编辑部召集。这个学院在最近出版的第二期学报上登载了李良、刘焕文认为旧中国有丰富的法律遗产可以吸取的两篇论文，这些论文引起了全市法学界人士的注意。
    从事法学工作二十多年的李良、刘焕文的论点是：新旧法律思想有内在联系，如社会主义公有制、惩治反革命等某些新法律思想在旧社会中即已存在，新法律的诉讼程序、监狱制度等，也是扬弃了旧法律思想反动的一面，而充实了新的内容的。他们认为承认这种联系，并不否认或降低新法律科学的阶级性。
    多数法学者在讨论会上都赞同这种见解，纷纷列举了古代许多法学论著，尤其认为唐朝的法律是我国历代法典的代表，不少有用的内容可以吸取。讨论者还对六百年前宋朝的“洗冤录”很感兴趣，这是一部辨别人是自死还是被杀死的法学论著。对这部论著有研究的学者俞承修等都举例说明其中有很多法律检验的科学经验。
    会上，已年老退休的法律教授洪文澜和一些年轻的法学工作者认为，旧法律的思想是剥削阶级思想，可以研究、批判，但不能作为遗产吸取来充实新法律的思想内容，能够吸取的应该只是旧法制的某些形式和法医等技术经验。
    讨论会共进行了六小时。到会的三十多个法学工作者一致认为，今后法学的研究应该跟上其他科学，大力贯彻“百家争鸣”的方针，特别在如何对待祖国法律遗产这个重要问题上，应该大胆地继续展开深入研究和讨论，使我国的法律科学在社会主义建设事业中，也开出芬芳的花朵。会上还讨论了法学工作者如何加强马克思列宁主义的修养，如何大力收集、整理和利用古今中外许多法律图书资料等问题。（新华社）
