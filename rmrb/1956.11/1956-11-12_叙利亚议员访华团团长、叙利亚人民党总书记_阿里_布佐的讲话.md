The Syrian parliamentary delegation feels very honored to be invited to attend the memorial meeting for Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the first founder of New China. He was a pioneer in the pursuit of freedom and one of the great leaders of the Eastern vanguard. These leaders, with their free thinking and persistent struggle, opened up paths for their people, leading them to liberation, freedom, and a better life.

The Syrian Arab people, who have always been concerned about and believed in the heroic struggle of the Chinese people, believe that the victory of the Chinese people in the fight against aggression, imperialism, feudalism, and reactionaries belongs to all people who have struggled in the past and are still struggling, fighting the forces of aggression until they achieve the freedom, happiness, and peace they seek.

Because you have given us the opportunity to visit this friendly country, during our short stay we feel that the Chinese people, who are in the midst of struggle, have made great progress in all aspects of life, and the country has also achieved success in realizing the unity of the people. We have also seen how the Chinese people are gently and wisely developing their national economy, making it an economy owned by the people, and making it the main factor benefiting the people. We feel that we have a sincere desire to strive for the friendship of all peoples in struggle, especially the friendship of the Chinese people. We are closely united with the Chinese people to defend our two countries from imperialist aggression. Our two countries have suffered from the pain of imperialist occupation in the past, and the progress and development of our two countries have been hindered by imperialism for a long time. The growing and increasingly solid relationship between the peoples of Asia and Africa is the greatest pillar for safeguarding world peace. Resisting the armed aggression of imperialism against our country today and against another country tomorrow depends to a great extent on the increasing closeness and further development of this relationship. China, under the leadership of heroic leaders such as Sun Yat-sen and Mao Zedong, has demonstrated its heroic and fearless spirit in the fight against imperialism. Today, China is also increasingly demonstrating its determination to fight against imperialism everywhere. We see genuine resentment on everyone's face, which is a reflection of the aggression suffered by the Arab people. We have heard speeches and statements from responsible persons, and we have seen people's demonstrations and their great support for us. All of this fully proves that the front of freedom-loving and anti-imperialist peoples is constantly growing stronger. Now more than ever, we feel that if we want to pull out the fangs of imperialism and destroy its tools of aggression, we must support each other and unite to oppose the imperialist bloc and the imperialist attempts to restore the land it has lost in our two countries and elsewhere and its constant conspiracies.

The rich and noble feelings of support for the just cause of Egypt flowing from the hearts of the friendly Chinese people fill our hearts with love and admiration for the Chinese people. The effective efforts made by the Chinese people to liberate their motherland, to rebuild their motherland, and to build it into a great and prosperous country, make us value very much the many achievements we have learned about in the Chinese people's struggle, and the rich experience they have gained in the long-term struggle for liberation and construction. There is no doubt that the connection between the Chinese and Arab peoples, and the strengthening of this connection, and the establishment of economic and political relations between our two peoples, are indeed the most important events experienced in this historical stage. This relationship will not only bring great benefits to the Chinese and Arab peoples and the peoples of Asia and Africa, but will also be a strong fortress for smashing the perfidious attempts of imperialism.

In the name of the Syrian parliamentary delegation, including members of various parties in the Syrian Parliament, at the conference commemorating the hero of liberation, Dr. Sun Yat-sen, I express my highest respect, and on behalf of the Arab people of Syria, I extend friendly greetings to our friends, the respected Chinese people.

    叙利亚议员访华团团长、叙利亚人民党总书记
    阿里·布佐的讲话
    叙利亚议员代表团感到很荣幸，能被邀请出席新中国第一个奠基人孙逸仙博士诞辰纪念会，他是自由追求者的先锋、是东方先锋队伟大的领袖之一，这些领袖们用他们自由的思想和坚持不断的斗争，为他们的人民开辟了道路，把人民引向解放、自由和美好的生活。
    经常关心并相信中国人民英勇的斗争的叙利亚阿拉伯人民，认为中国人民在反对侵略，反对帝国主义，反对封建主义和反动派的战斗中获得的胜利是属于所有过去曾经斗争过而现在仍然在斗争着的人民，他们和侵略势力在搏斗，一直到他们所追求的自由、幸福与和平实现为止。
    由于你们使我们有机会来访问这个友好的国家，在我们这个短促的逗留期间，我们觉得在战斗中的中国人民在生活的各个方面，都已有了很大的进步，这个国家在实现人民的团结方面也已取得了成就，我们也看到中国人民如何温和地，明智地在发展他们国家的国民经济，并使它成为人民所有的经济，使它成为造福人民的主要因素。我们觉得我们自己有真诚的愿望，来争取在斗争中的各国人民的友谊，首先是中国人民的友谊。我们和中国人民紧密的团结在一起，保卫我们两国不受帝国主义的侵略。我们两国过去曾经尝受过帝国主义占领的痛苦，我们两国的进步和发展曾经长期的受到帝国主义的阻碍。亚非各国人民之间日益发展和日益巩固的关系是保卫世界和平的最伟大的支柱。抵抗帝国主义今天对我们国家以及明天对别一个国家的武装侵略，在很大的程度上有赖于这种关系的日趋密切和进一步的发展。中国在英勇的领袖，如孙逸仙，毛泽东的领导之下在打击帝国主义方面已经表现了他的英勇无畏的精神，今天中国也日益表明了它向各个地方的帝国主义进行斗争的决心。我们从每个人的脸上看到了真正的愤恨，这是对阿拉伯人民所遭受到的侵略的一种反映。我们听到了负责人士的讲话和声明，我们看到了人民的游行示威，以及他们对我们的巨大支持。这一切都充分的证明渴望自由的、反对帝国主义的各国人民的阵线，正在不断地强大。我们现在比过去任何时候，更感觉到，如果要想拔掉帝国主义的狗牙，要想毁掉帝国主义的侵略工具，我们必须互相支持，互相团结，来反对帝国主义集团，反对帝国主义企图恢复它在我们两国和其他地方所丧失的土地而不断进行的阴谋。
    从友好的中国人民心里流露出来的支持埃及正义事业的丰富的崇高的情感，使我们内心充满了对中国人民的热爱和敬佩。中国人民为解放祖国、为重新建设祖国、把祖国建成一个伟大的富强的国家所做的有效的努力，使我们非常重视我们所了解到的关于中国人民斗争的许多成果，以及他们在争取解放和进行建设当中长期获得的丰富经验。毫无疑义，中国人民和阿拉伯人民之间的联系，及这种联系的加强，和我们两国人民之间的经济、政治关系的建立，的确是我们这个历史阶段所经历的最重要的大事。这种关系不但会给中国人民和阿拉伯人民以及亚非各国人民带来极大的好处。而且将是粉碎帝国主义背信弃义的企图的坚强堡垒。
    我以包括叙利亚议会各党团的成员的叙利亚议员代表团的名义，在纪念解放英雄孙逸仙博士的大会上，表示崇高的敬意，并代表叙利亚的阿拉伯人民向我们的朋友、尊敬的中国人民致以友好的敬意。
