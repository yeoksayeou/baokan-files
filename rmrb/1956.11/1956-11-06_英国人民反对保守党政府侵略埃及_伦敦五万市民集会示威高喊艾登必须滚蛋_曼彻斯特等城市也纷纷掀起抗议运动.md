　　By our correspondent Pan Fei, London, 5th (Urgent dispatch) -- A nationwide movement to stop the war has begun. On November 4th, a rally of 50,000 London citizens was held in Trafalgar Square to oppose the Conservative government's invasion of Egypt.
　　According to newspaper reports, mass rallies of similar scale to the London rally were also held in nine major cities. These nine cities include: Manchester, the center of the textile industry; Sheffield, the steel industry city; and Glasgow, the center of the Clyde shipbuilding area. Rallies were also held in Leeds, Newcastle, and Birmingham, the center of the automotive industry.
　　The London mass rally marks the first high tide of the movement against armed intervention in Egypt, and demonstrates that the British people have taken action. In Trafalgar Square, demonstrators surged in, and the nearby streets were filled with people. People held flags and signs with slogans such as "Stop the war launched by the Conservatives!" The rally began at three o'clock, and Bevan and other leaders of the Labor and Cooperative parties spoke at the rally. Bevan said, "I have spoken at many demonstrations in Trafalgar Square in the past twenty-five years, but I think this is the largest demonstration I have seen." He criticized the Conservative Party's actions, saying, "Eden's excuse for invading Egypt is actually the same as Hitler's excuse for invading Czechoslovakia." When speakers called for "stopping the war," the venue was filled with thunderous applause.
　　After the mass rally, about 10,000 people poured into Whitehall, intending to go to 10 Downing Street, where the British Cabinet was holding a meeting. In the demonstration, the shouts of "Eden must go!" rose and fell continuously.
　　At this time, mounted police launched an attack on the crowd, and twenty-seven demonstrators were arrested, and some injured were sent to the hospital. People saw several demonstrators being dragged into a police car on Downing Street after being beaten, one of whom was already unconscious. The crowd erupted in angry roars, protesting the shameful fascist behavior.
　　During the occupation of Whitehall, the conflict between the police and the crowd occurred around 4:30 PM, and it was not until 6:00 PM that the police cleared the road from Whitehall to Parliament Square and Trafalgar Square. It is said that this was the largest and most violent conflict in Whitehall in the past twenty years.

　　Xinhua News Agency, London, 5th -- With the exception of a very small number of Conservatives, all Britons have risen up against the Anglo-French invasion of Egypt. The protest movement is now of unprecedented scale.
　　On November 4th, in addition to the rally in Trafalgar Square in London, similar mass rallies were also held in Birmingham, Nottingham, Leicester, Brighton and many other cities.

    英国人民反对保守党政府侵略埃及
    伦敦五万市民集会示威高喊艾登必须滚蛋
    曼彻斯特等城市也纷纷掀起抗议运动
    本报记者潘非伦敦5日急电  一个全国性的制止战争运动已经展开。11月4日在特拉法加广场举行了五万伦敦市民的集会，反对保守党政府侵略埃及。
    据报纸的报道，在九个大城市也举行了和伦敦的群众大会同样声势浩大的群众大会。这九个城市包括：纺织工业中心曼彻斯特、钢铁工业城市设菲尔德、克莱德造船区中心格拉斯哥。在里子、纽卡斯尔和汽车工业中心伯明翰也举行了集会。
    伦敦的群众大会标志着反对武装干涉埃及运动的第一个高潮，并表明英国人民群众已经行动起来了。在特拉法加广场上，示威者潮涌而来，附近的街道都被人群挤满了。人们高举着旗帜和写着“制止保守党发动的战争！”口号的标语牌。大会在三点钟开始，比万以及工党和合作党的其他领袖在大会上讲话。比万说：“在过去的二十五年，在特拉法加广场的许多次示威，我都说过话，但我认为这是我看到的最大的示威。”他抨击保守党的行动，说：“艾登侵略埃及的借口实际上就是希特勒侵略捷克斯洛伐克的借口。”当演讲者要求“制止战争”的时候，会场上掌声如雷。
    举行过群众大会之后，约一万名群众涌进白厅大道，打算到唐宁街十号去。在那儿，英国内阁正在举行会议。在示威队伍中，“艾登必须滚蛋”的喊声，此起彼落，连续不绝。
    这时，警察骑队发动向群众袭击，有二十七名示威群众被捕，一些受伤者已送往医院。人们看见有几名示威者在挨打后被拉上唐宁街的一辆警车上，其中一人已经人事不省。群众发出了一片怒吼，抗议可耻的法西斯行为。
    在占领白厅大道的时候，警察和群众的冲突发生在下午四时三十分左右，直到下午六时，警察才打通了从白厅大道到议会广场和特拉法加广场的道路。据说这是白厅大道二十年来最大最猛烈的一次冲突。
    据新华社伦敦5日电　除去很少数保守党人之外，所有的英国人都起来反对英法对埃及的侵略。抗议运动现在具有前所未有的规模。
    11月4日，除在伦敦特拉法加广场举行集会外，伯明翰、诺丁汉、列斯特、布莱顿和其他许多城市，也举行了类似的群众集会。
