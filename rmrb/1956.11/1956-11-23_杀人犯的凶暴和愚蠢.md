    The Murderer's Ferocity and Stupidity

    The British Labour MP, Mr. Wedgwood, once gave a precise comment on the "British Voice" radio station located on the island of Cyprus: "A collection of lies, stupidity, and clumsiness." In fact, the "British Voice" radio station is just a mouthpiece for 10 Downing Street in London. British Prime Minister Eden's personal performance is no less inferior to the "British Voice."

    If you don't believe it, please look at a passage in Eden's recent reply to Bulganin: "You accuse us of barbaric attacks on Egyptian cities and villages. Our attacks on airports and other military targets were carried out with extreme caution in order to reduce human casualties to a minimum. Some casualties were probably unavoidable. We express our deep regret for them." What a merciful murderer! What a noble gentlemanly demeanor! They slaughtered tens of thousands of women and children in Egypt, bombing churches and hospitals like beasts. But they still have the nerve to quibble that this was the "minimum," and stretch out their bloodied hands to express "regret"!

    What exactly is Eden's "minimum" "limit"? Listen to the report of Swedish photographer Andersson, who was on the scene: "I feel that the horror and terrible means of treating civilians that I saw in Port Said are something I have never seen anywhere else." This neutral country reporter tremblingly said, "This tragic situation is beyond description." As for the tragic situation of the Anglo-French barbaric bombing, it has been witnessed by more foreign journalists. In the suburbs of Cairo, they saw the dome of a church that had been bombed through. In the Abu Zabal district, even prisons were targets of British bombing. United Press reporter David Bisser reported after visiting the bombed prison that he saw at least seventy bodies. He wrote: "As I walked among the broken walls and rubble, the stench of corpses was pungent. A guard said that he could not say the exact number of casualties in the prison and nearby villages, but there were always one hundred and several dozen... A human arm floated on the dark water accumulated in a crater. Two corpses lay on a pile of broken bricks, one leg missing, one head shattered. Nearby was the corpse of a gray-haired man. His stomach flowed out of his abdominal cavity onto the ground."

    These murderers are not only so brutal to the Egyptian people, but they are also extremely savage to foreign journalists. On November 17, Anglo-French forces not only prevented twenty foreign journalists from entering Port Said, but also opened fire on them, detained them for more than twelve hours, and transported them away in stuffy trucks. They thought they could hide their bloody hands in this way. However, these stupid and clumsy murderers did not expect that their barbaric means of blockading the news would further prove that everything they have done in Port Said up to now cannot be seen by others.

    杀人犯的凶暴和愚蠢
    英国工党议员韦季伍德，曾给设在塞浦路斯岛上的“英国之音”电台下了一个精辟的评语：“谎言、愚蠢和笨拙的总汇。”其实，“英国之音”电台不过是伦敦唐宁街十号的传声筒而已。英国首相艾登的亲自表演也同“英国之音”毫无逊色。
    不信，请看艾登在最近给布尔加宁的复信中的一段话：“您指责我们野蛮地袭击埃及的城市和村庄。我们对于飞机场和其他军事目标的袭击是极其谨慎地进行的，以便使人的伤亡减少到最低限度。某些伤亡大概是不可避免的。对于他们我们深表遗憾。”多么慈悲的杀人犯！多么高贵的绅士气派！他们在埃及屠杀了成千成万的妇女儿童，野兽似地轰炸教堂和医院。可是他们还有脸皮狡辩这是“最低限度”，而且伸出血手来表示“遗憾”！
    究竟艾登的“最低限度”是什么“限度”呢？请听听亲历现场的瑞典摄影记者安德逊的报道：“我觉得我在塞得港所看到的那种对待平民的恐怖和可怕手段，是我从来没有在别的地方看到过的。”这个中立国记者战抖地说：“这种惨状是笔墨难以形容的。”至于英法的野蛮轰炸的惨状，这是有更多的外国记者所目睹的。在开罗近郊，他们看到了被炸穿的教堂的圆形屋顶。在阿布扎巴勒区，甚至监狱，也是英国的轰炸目标。合众社记者大卫·比塞在访问了这所被轰炸后的监狱之后报道说，他看到了至少七十具尸体。他写道：“当我走在断墙残壁之间的时候，尸体的臭气刺鼻。一个看守者说，他说不清监狱和附近村庄死伤的确切人数，但是总有一百好几十个……在一个弹坑中阴暗的积水上浮着一支人臂。在破砖堆上躺着两个尸体，一个腿已经没有了，一个头破碎了。附近有一个灰头发的人的尸体。他的胃从腹腔里流出在地上。”
    这些杀人犯不但对埃及人民是这样凶残，他们甚至对外国记者也极度的野蛮。在11月17日，英法军队不仅阻止二十名外国记者进入塞得港，而且向他们开枪，把他们拘留了十二小时以上再用闷卡车把他们运走。他们以为这样就能掩藏他们的血手。但是，这些愚蠢而又笨拙的杀人犯却没有想到，他们这种野蛮的封锁新闻的手段，却更加证明了直到现在他们在塞得港所干的一切都是见不得人的。　（何耕新）
