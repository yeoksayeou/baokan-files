Passengers' Voices

    In Shenyang

    In Shenyang, travelers cannot freely choose their accommodation, nor can hotels freely accept guests. The Travelers' Liaison Station uniformly allocates lodging. Every day, the Travelers' Liaison Station is crowded with thousands of people waiting for allocation, often waiting for one or two days before they can find a hotel. During the waiting period, they cannot work or rest, and they must worry about losing important documents. Moreover, in the harsh winter, how can they endure waiting in line at the Liaison Station? At the same time, the housing allocated by the Liaison Station is not always reasonable. Once, they allocated me a room that could accommodate three people and would not allow a change.

    The Liaison Station was originally established to facilitate travelers. However, the Shenyang Liaison Station not only fails to provide convenience to travelers but also adds many unnecessary difficulties. This management method must be improved. I suggest: 1. Travelers who can find a hotel themselves should be accommodated by the hotel; those who cannot find one themselves can be accommodated by the Liaison Station. 2. The Liaison Station should display a map of the city's hotels and travel routes to facilitate travelers' search.

    In Baotou

    I arrived in Baotou on October 27th for official business, getting off the train at 22:12. Because all the hotels, large and small, were full, the Passenger Service Station directed me to Dazhong Inn to sleep on a communal platform bed. The person in charge of the inn first declared: we must leave by six o'clock tomorrow morning, otherwise, we cannot stay. This was negotiated between them and the Service Station. It was already midnight. Many of us guests pleaded bitterly, asking him to contact the Passenger Service Station again and requesting them to find us a place to stay tomorrow, but everything was rejected.

    Why are the hotels in Baotou so strained? The main reason is that Baotou has developed from a city of 70,000 to 80,000 people to a city of 300,000 people, while the service industry has not been able to keep up with the city's development. I hope the relevant departments in Baotou will quickly take effective measures to solve this problem.

    In Harbin and Changchun

    When our field staff arrive in Harbin and Changchun, they often walk all night carrying their luggage and still cannot find a place to stay. Because hotels are hard to find, an abnormal phenomenon has now emerged: some people who come to these places often, in order to solve the accommodation problem, cultivate relationships with the hotel managers and accountants, and before their next visit, send a letter to the manager, notifying the hotel to reserve a room. Thus, they become "regular customers" of these hotels, making accommodation easier. Therefore, the hotel staff do not like to pay attention to "new customers," making the accommodation problem for "new customers" even more difficult.

    In Lanzhou

    The biggest difficulty travelers encounter in Lanzhou is finding a hotel. In September, I went on a business trip, arriving in Lanzhou at 4:30 PM. We walked several streets and asked sixteen or seventeen hotels, each with a "Full" sign. We also visited several hotels in quiet alleys, but before we even entered, the staff would greet us: "Comrade, there are no rooms here. Please ask over there." When we went over there, it was still "Full." We carried our luggage, asking at each place we found until we finally found a room. When I looked at the time, it was already 9:00 PM. The hotel staff even said we were "really lucky."

    Why is it so difficult to find a hotel in such a large city as Lanzhou? According to our understanding, in addition to the shortage of hotels, there are also some shortcomings in the work. For example, some organizations in Lanzhou book entire hotels for meetings, and some hotels are booked for as long as half a month without anyone coming to stay. Some hotels also have regulations regarding the length of stay for travelers. Before the allowed check-in time, they will not accept guests even if they have empty rooms. On the morning of September 6th, when I was about to leave Dahua Hotel on Heping Road in Lanzhou at 8:00 AM, a soldier came to find a room. The hotel staff told him there were none. In fact, the room I had been staying in was empty. Why didn't they let the soldier stay? Because they don't accept guests in the morning. This unreasonable phenomenon also exists in Baoji, Xi'an, Xianyang, Xining, and other places.

    In Zhanjiang

    Zhanjiang is a key construction city. Since the Li-Zhan Railway opened last year and construction on Zhanjiang Port began, the market has prospered, and the number of travelers has increased daily. Compared with the same period last year, the number of hotel guests in the third quarter of this year has more than doubled. However, the hotels are still mostly the original small inns. We often borrow the union hall and school dormitories to accommodate travelers, and many travelers sleep on the streets or at the station overnight.

    In fact, there were many hotels in the city before liberation, but after liberation, many large hotels were occupied by the military and government agencies. For example, "Dazhong Hotel" and "Shengli Hotel" are occupied by the military, "Nanjia" Hotel is occupied by the Zhanjiang Prefectural Industrial Department, "Liuguo Hotel" is occupied by the Reclamation Bureau, "Aiqun Hotel" is occupied by the Liangguang Saltworks Dormitory and Aquatic Products Company, and "Zhongxing," "Baoshi," and "Ouya" Hotels are occupied by the department stores and pharmaceutical company outlets. If the above hotels could be vacated (except for those occupied by enterprise outlets, which are difficult to vacate, the rest could be vacated), the supply and demand of hotels in the city could basically be balanced. We have repeatedly requested the relevant departments to assist in resolving this issue in the past, but it has not yet been realized.

### 旅客的呼声

    旅客的呼声
    在沈阳
    在沈阳，旅客不能自由投宿，旅店也不能自由收留客人，必须由旅店联络站统一分配旅客住处。每天旅店联络站拥挤着上千的人等候分配，常常要等候一两天才能住上旅馆。在等候分配的时间里，既不能工作，也不能休息，还要耽心携带的重要文件不致遗失；再说，到了严寒的冬天，在联络站排号又怎能挺得住呢？同时，联络站分配的住房并不完全合理。有一次，他们给我分了一间可以住三个人的房间，要求更换也不允许。
    联络站本来是为了便利旅客而设立的。而沈阳的联络站不仅没有给旅客以方便，反而增加了很多不必要的困难，这种管理方法必须改进。我建议：一、旅客自己能找到旅馆的，旅馆应该收留；自己找不到的，可以由联络站负责安置。二、联络站应该挂一张全市旅馆所在地及行走路线图，便于旅客寻找。

    在包头
    我于10月27日到包头市公干，二十二点十二分下车。因为大小旅馆都满员，由旅客服务站介绍到大众大车店睡通铺。大车店的负责人首先声明：限明天早晨六时就得走，否则不留，这是他们与服务站协商好的。这时已经是夜十二时，我们好多客人苦苦哀求，请他再与旅客服务站联系一下，并要求明天给我们找一个住处，但一切都被拒绝了。
    包头市的旅馆为啥这样紧张呢？主要原因是包头市已经由过去的七、八万人口发展到三十万人口的城市了，而服务业没有能适应着城市的发展赶上来。希望包头市有关部门赶快采取有效措施解决这个问题。　　　　　　　　王清海
    在哈尔滨和长春
    我们外勤工作人员到了哈尔滨和长春，下火车以后，背着行李常常走一宿也找不到个住处。因为旅馆难找，现在已经出现了一种不正常的现象：有些常来这些地方的人为了解决住宿困难，他们就和旅馆的经理、会计拉拢关系，并在下次要来之前，先给经理去一封公函，通知旅馆留房间。于是，他们就变成了这些旅馆的“熟客”，住宿较方便。因此，旅馆的工作人员对“生客”也就不爱答理了，“生客”的住宿问题也就更难解决了。　　　　　　　卫国
    在兰州
    旅客到了兰州，遇到的最大困难是旅馆难找。9月间我出了一趟差，下午四时半到兰州，我们走了几条大街，问过十六、七家旅店，每家旅店都挂着“客满”的牌子，我们又访问了僻静小巷内的几家旅店，还没走进去，服务员见你一来就打招呼：“同志，这儿没房间了，请到那边问问吧。”到了那边，仍然是‘客满’我们扛着行李见一家问一家，总算找了一个房间住下了。我一看表已经是晚上九点了，旅店的人还说我们“真走运”。
    为什么偌大的兰州市连旅店也找不下呢？据我们了解，除了旅店少而外，还有一些工作中的缺点。比方，兰州的某些机关要开会，就预包旅店，有的旅店被包出足有半个月也不来人住；还有的旅店收留旅客有规定时间，不到留客时间，有空房也不收客。9月6日早晨八时，我将要离开兰州和平路大华旅社时，恰好一位军人来找房间。旅社的人告诉他没有。实际上我原来住的房间就空着。他为什么不让这位军人住下呢？因为早晨不收留客人。这种不合理的现象，在宝鸡、西安、咸阳、西宁等地也同样存在。

    在湛江
    湛江市是个重点建设城市，自去年黎湛铁路通车，湛江港开始施工后，市场繁荣，来往旅客日增，以本年第三季度住店人数与去年同期比较，已增加一倍多，而旅店仍多是原来的小客栈，我们往往借工会礼堂、学校宿舍给旅客住，不少旅客去街头、车站露宿过夜。
    其实本市在解放前旅店不少，但解放后大旅店多为军队、机关占用，如：“大中酒店”“胜利大旅店”为部队占用，“南价”大旅店为湛江专区工业处占用，“六国大旅店”为垦殖局占用，“爱群旅店”为两广盐场宿舍及水产公司占用，“中兴”“宝石”“欧亚”等大旅店为百货公司医药公司门市部占用。以上这些旅店如能让出（除被企业门市部占用的难让外，其余均可让出），就可基本上使本市旅店供求平衡。我们过去曾多次请求有关单位协助解决这问题，但至今还未实现。
