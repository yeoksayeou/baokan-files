Xinhua News Agency report: The Limin Agricultural Production Cooperative in Gushu Township, Yingkou County, Liaoning Province, recently corrected its one-sided mass perspective, which neglected the interests of the state and the collective interests of the cooperative, and revised its autumn harvest distribution plan. According to this new plan, after retaining a certain percentage of public accumulation fund, public welfare fund, and next year's production expenses, as well as fully repaying the matured state loans, the cooperative will distribute 67% of the total income to its members, and 94% of the members will be able to increase their income compared to last year.

The Limin Agricultural Cooperative had a bumper harvest this year, with total grain output more than double that of last year. The total income of the cooperative can reach more than 83,000 yuan. When the autumn harvest distribution plan was first formulated, due to the insufficient understanding of the consistency of the interests of the state, the cooperative, and the members by the cooperative's cadres, and a one-sided understanding of the principle of "less retention and more distribution," it was stipulated that only 3.5% of the public accumulation fund would be retained, and the rest would be distributed to the members. Nothing was retained for the public welfare fund and next year's production expenses, etc.; the 2,400 yuan in matured loans owed to the state were also intended to be left unpaid.

    营口利民农业社修订分配方案
    纠正不顾国家集体利益的偏向
    据新华社讯　辽宁省营口县古树乡利民农业生产合作社，最近纠正了片面群众观点、忽视国家和合作社集体利益的偏向，重新修订了秋收分配方案。按照这个新的方案进行分配，这个社除留下一定比例的公积金、公益金和明年的生产费用以及全部偿还到期的国家贷款外，分给社员的还占总收入的67％，94％的社员都能比去年增加收入。
    利民农业社今年获得了大丰收，粮食总产量比去年提高了一倍多。全社总收入可以达到八万三千多元。在第一次制定秋收分配方案的时候，由于社的干部对国家、合作社和社员三者利益的一致性认识不足，片面地领会“少扣多分”的原则，便规定只留下3.5％的公积金，其余的全部分给社员，公益金和明年的生产费用等一点也没留；欠国家的到期贷款两千四百元也打算一文不还。
