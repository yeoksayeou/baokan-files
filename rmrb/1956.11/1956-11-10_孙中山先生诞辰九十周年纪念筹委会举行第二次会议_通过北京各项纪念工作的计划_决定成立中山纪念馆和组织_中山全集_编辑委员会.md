The meeting also decided to organize the "Complete Works of Sun Yat-sen" Editorial Committee.

The original plan to visit Sun Yat-sen's former residence at Tieshizi Hutong in Beijing, where he passed away, was abandoned because the original appearance of the house has long been altered and it would be difficult to restore it in a short time. The meeting decided not to open it to the public for the time being.
