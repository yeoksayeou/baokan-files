    Further Examination of Shortcomings in Work
    The article "The Dust of Bureaucracy" written by Comrade Liu Dai on the fourth page of the People's Daily on August 26th criticized our bureau for issuing three notices for one meeting. This correct and timely criticism is of great help in improving our work. We accept the criticism from the Party newspaper with a sincere and humble attitude.
    The circumstances of this error are as follows: We held a national grain inspection work symposium in May of this year. Because the preparatory work before the meeting was not done well, we first decided to send a simple telegram to notify the date of the meeting and the personnel attending the meeting. Then we issued another notice regarding the materials needed for the meeting, etc. Because we did not have a sufficient understanding of the changes in the leadership relationship of the provincial and municipal inspection agencies, the notice we issued did not explain the participants in detail, so we issued a supplementary notice later.
    The main reason for this error is that we have serious bureaucracy and a careless style of work, a poor sense of responsibility for work, and insufficient consideration of the actual situation, which has caused waste of state property and damage to work. Through the exposure of this problem, we are willing to deeply accept this lesson and further examine the errors and shortcomings in our work to ensure that similar errors do not occur in the future.

### 进一步检查工作中的缺点

    进一步检查工作中的缺点
    8月26日人民日报第四版刘岱同志写的“官僚主义的灰尘”一文中批评我局召开一次会议连发三次通知的错误，这一正确及时的批评，对改进我们的工作有很大帮助，我们以诚恳虚心的态度，接受党报的批评。
    这一错误发生的经过情况是这样的：我们在今年5月召开一次全国粮食监察工作座谈会，由于会前的准备工作没做好，先决定发一个简单的电报通知开会日期及参加会议的人员，然后将会议所需材料等事项再发一个通知，由于我们对省、市监察机构领导关系变动情况了解不够，因而所发出的通知没有详细说明参加人员，后来又发一个补充通知。
    造成这一错误的原因，主要是我们在工作中存在严重的官僚主义和粗枝大叶的作风，对工作责任心差，对实际情况考虑不周，从而给国家财产造成浪费，使工作受到损失。通过这一问题的揭发，我们愿深刻接受这一教训，进一步检查我们工作中的错误和缺点，保证今后不再发生类似错误。
