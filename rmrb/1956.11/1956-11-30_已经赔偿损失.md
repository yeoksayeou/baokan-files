    Losses Already Compensated
    Xu Jing from the Third Engineering Section of the Second Engineering Company of the Northeast Engineering Management Bureau wrote: The criticism of our section in the article "Public Theft" published on page two of the People's Daily on August 26th is completely correct. We have also made a self-criticism to our superiors and apologized to the relevant units and compensated for the losses.
