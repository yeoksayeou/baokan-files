    At a Farewell Reception in Phnom Penh
    Premier Zhou Enlai's Speech
    Your Royal Highness Prince Sihanouk, Your Excellency Prime Minister San Yun, Your Royal Highness Prince Penn Nouth, Ladies and Gentlemen:
    Tomorrow, my colleagues and I will conclude our friendly visit to Cambodia. At this farewell moment, I deeply feel that words are inadequate to fully express our gratitude and reluctance to part. The past five days have been unforgettable in our lives. The kind concern of the King and Queen, the gracious and heartfelt hospitality personally hosted by Your Royal Highness Prince Sihanouk, Your Royal Highness Prince Penn Nouth, and Your Excellency Prime Minister San Yun, the meticulous care, and the warm and grand welcome from the Cambodian people have all made us feel like we are at home with our loved ones. Wherever we went, whether in cities or villages, whether day or night, the flags of the Kingdom of Cambodia and the People's Republic of China fluttered everywhere, cheers of "Long Live Sino-Cambodian Friendship" resounded everywhere, and the fraternal affection between the peoples of China and Cambodia overflowed everywhere. Your warm hospitality and enthusiastic welcome far exceeded the reception given by the Chinese government and people to Your Royal Highness Prince Sihanouk and the delegation of the Kingdom of Cambodia. I must convey this deep affection of the Cambodian people to the Chinese people, so that the Chinese people know that in the southern part of Asia we have a friendly neighbor, and the people there are our close brothers.
    During these five days, through visits to Phnom Penh, Kampong Cham, and Siem Reap, and through cruising on the Mekong River, we have gained a more concrete understanding of Cambodia and developed a deeper affection for it.
    We have seen growing cities, fertile fields, abundant products, and untapped resources. We have also seen the hard-working and patriotic Cambodian people. This provides Cambodia with the conditions to become a prosperous and strong country and the potential for infinite development.
    We have seen beautiful ancient art and magnificent cultural monuments. This embodies the creative genius and wisdom of the Cambodian people since ancient times. We believe that in our era, the Cambodian people will surely be able to create a greater and more brilliant culture on a new foundation.
    We have also seen the Cambodian people's friendliness and tolerance towards overseas Chinese. Through more than a thousand years of close interaction, the Cambodian people have forged brotherly and kinship ties with overseas Chinese. The Chinese government will, in accordance with its consistent policy, further encourage overseas Chinese to integrate with the Cambodian people, share weal and woe, abide by Cambodian laws, respect Cambodian customs, and contribute all their strength to Cambodia's prosperity and development.
    Although our visit to Cambodia this time has been short, the friendly cooperative relations between China and Cambodia have been further developed through the contact between the leaders of our two countries. The people of both our countries are working hard for the rejuvenation of our motherlands. We should further expand economic cooperation and cultural exchanges between our two countries on the basis of equality, mutual benefit, and without any conditions attached, to promote our respective construction undertakings. Our two countries should not only set an example in strictly adhering to the Five Principles in our mutual relations, but should also work harder, without excluding any country, to promote the application of the Five Principles in general international relations, so as to jointly contribute to world peace.
    Dear friends, let us raise our glasses together,
    To the prosperity of the Kingdom of Cambodia and the well-being of its people,
    To the promotion and enhancement of the friendship between China and Cambodia on the basis of the Five Principles—Panchasila,
    To the health and longevity of Their Majesties the King and Queen of Cambodia.

    在金边举行的告别招待会上
    周恩来总理的讲话西哈努克亲王殿下、桑云首相阁下、宾努亲王阁下、女士们、先生们：
    明天我和我的同事们就要结束我们在柬埔寨的友好访问。在这个临别的时刻，我深深地感到语言的不足，不能完全表达我们感激和惜别的心情。过去的五天是我们一生难忘的日子。国王和王后陛下的亲切关怀，西哈努克亲王殿下、宾努亲王阁下和桑云首相阁下亲自主持的盛情可感的招待、无微不至的照料和柬埔寨人民的热烈盛大的欢迎，都使我们感到像在家里同亲人们处在一起一样。我们所到之处，不论是城市和乡村，不论是白天和黑夜，到处都飘扬着柬埔寨王国和中华人民共和国的国旗，到处都欢呼着柬中友好万岁，到处都洋溢着中柬两国人民兄弟般的感情。你们对我们的盛情款待和热烈欢迎远超过中国政府和人民对西哈努克亲王殿下和柬埔寨王国国家代表团的接待。我一定要向中国人民转达柬埔寨人民的这种深情厚意，让中国人民知道，在亚洲的南部有我们一个友好的邻邦，那里的人民是我们亲密的兄弟。
    五天来，通过在金边、磅湛和暹粒的参观，通过湄公河上的游览，我们对柬埔寨有了更具体的认识，产生了更深厚的感情。
    我们看到了在成长中的城市，肥沃的田野，丰富的物产和还没有开发的资源。我们还看到了辛勤劳动和热爱祖国的柬埔寨人民。这就使柬埔寨具备了成为一个富强国家的条件和无穷发展的潜力。
    我们看到了优美的古代艺术和雄伟的文化古迹。这体现出柬埔寨人民自古以来的创造天才和智慧。我们相信，在我们的时代，柬埔寨人民一定能够在新的基础上创造出更伟大、更光辉灿烂的文化。
    我们还看到了柬埔寨人民对华侨的友好和宽容。通过千年以上的亲密相处，柬埔寨人民已经同华侨结成了兄弟的和亲戚的情谊。中国政府要根据一贯的政策，更加勉励华侨同柬埔寨人民打成一片，同甘共苦，遵守柬埔寨的法令，尊重柬埔寨的风俗习惯，并且为柬埔寨的繁荣发展贡献出一切力量。
    尽管我们这次在柬埔寨访问的时间不长，但是通过我们两国领导人员的接触，中柬两国的友好合作关系已经有了进一步发展。我们两国人民都在为祖国的复兴而努力。我们应该在平等互利和不附带任何条件的基础上更加开展两国之间的经济合作和文化交流，来促进我们各自的建设事业。我们两国不仅应该以身作则，在相互关系中严格遵守五项原则，并且应该更加努力，不排斥任何国家，来推广五项原则在一般国际关系中的应用，以便共同为世界和平作出贡献。
    亲爱的朋友们，让我们共同举杯，
    祝柬埔寨王国国家繁荣、人民兴旺，
    祝柬中两国的友谊在五项原则——潘查希拉——的基础上发扬光大，
    祝柬埔寨国王和王后陛下健康长寿。
