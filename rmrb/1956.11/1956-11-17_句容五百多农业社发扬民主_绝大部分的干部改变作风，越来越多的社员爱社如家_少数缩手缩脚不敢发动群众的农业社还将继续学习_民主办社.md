Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 15th. Since more than five hundred agricultural cooperatives in Jurong County, Jiangsu Province, began studying "running cooperatives democratically" in late August, the work style of the vast majority of cadres has changed, and the unity between cadres and members has been strengthened. Some agricultural cooperative cadres have proposed to "meet the members with five hearts," namely, to treat the members warmly, to persuade and educate them patiently, to handle cooperative affairs carefully, to be determined to overcome shortcomings, and to serve the members wholeheartedly. Some cooperative members have said that cadres who can examine and correct their mistakes are good cadres, and we will respect them.

The team leaders and above of the Second Agricultural Cooperative of Tianwang Township, who originally had a stiff attitude and a bad work style, have improved their relations with the members after most of them changed their work style, and the members' enthusiasm for production has increased, with an attendance rate increasing by more than 10% compared to the past. In the past, many farm tools in this cooperative were placed on the side of the village and in the alleys, exposed to the wind and rain. Now, the members actively move them back home for safekeeping. Some time ago, the Eighth Agricultural Cooperative of Yuanxiang Township distributed corn without consulting the members, which caused many opinions. This time, they learned the working methods of the mass line and consulted with the members when distributing early rice. As a result, forty households voluntarily signed up to temporarily forego the rice and let it be distributed to households without grain first, which changed the difficult situation of distribution in the past. Many members have put forward rationalization proposals. Many agricultural cooperatives in Luoshu Township and Tingzi Township suggested that when cadres promote japonica rice varieties next year, they should consider factors such as fertilizer, technology, and soil conditions, and not just act out of enthusiasm. Members of the Heping First Agricultural Cooperative in Baohua Township suggested that the cooperative should make plans for sideline production this winter and next spring as soon as possible. These suggestions have attracted the attention of the cooperative's leadership.

Jurong County basically achieved agricultural cooperativization this spring. After cooperativization, many management cadres of agricultural cooperatives developed a sense of pride and complacency under the new situation, and coupled with heavy tasks and few methods, the coercive command style of work developed. In response to this situation, the Jurong County Committee of the Communist Party of China led the county's agricultural cooperatives in August to carry out a study on the issue of "running cooperatives democratically." In addition to arranging the study of documents, it also organized work teams to go to key areas to provide specific assistance. Many township Party general branch secretaries and branch secretaries personally took charge of a cooperative to set an example and then promoted it throughout the township. They took the lead in examining their past shortcomings and mistakes in leading the work of running cooperatives. On the basis of raising ideological understanding, the cooperative's cadres also made self-criticisms to the members. Through group discussions, field chats, individual conversations, and other methods, the members launched a wide-ranging discussion on the issue of "running cooperatives democratically." Most members put forward sharp and pertinent criticisms to the cadres in the cooperative who had shortcomings in their democratic work style. Therefore, the democratic spirit of the cooperative has been promoted, and there are more and more cases of members loving the cooperative as their home.

In this study, some agricultural cooperatives did not learn well enough, and a few cadres even dared not mobilize the members to study, and their work was hesitant. Some members also had a tendency toward extreme democratization. At present, the Jurong County Committee of the Communist Party of China is leading the county's agricultural cooperatives to continue to study the issue of "running cooperatives democratically" in conjunction with the current production work. The specific requirements are: to eliminate various erroneous ideas that are not conducive to "running cooperatives democratically"; for agricultural cooperatives that dare not mobilize members to study, we will strengthen specific assistance and start learning from scratch.

    句容五百多农业社发扬民主
    绝大部分的干部改变作风，越来越多的社员爱社如家
    少数缩手缩脚不敢发动群众的农业社还将继续学习“民主办社”
    新华社南京15日电　江苏省句容县五百多个农业社自8月下旬开始学习“民主办社”以来，绝大多数干部的工作作风有了转变，干部和社员之间的团结加强了。有的农业社干部提出同社员“五心相见”，即热心对待社员，耐心说服教育，细心处理社务，决心克服缺点，全心全意为社员服务。有的社的社员表示，干部有错误能够检讨改正，就是好干部，我们就尊重他。
    天王乡第二农业社原来态度生硬、作风不好的小队长以上干部，绝大部分改变了作风以后，同社员关系改善，社员的生产积极性有了提高，出勤率比过去增加10％以上。这个社过去有好些农具放在村边巷头，任凭风吹雨打，现在社员们主动地把它们搬回家去保管了。袁巷乡第八农业社前些时候分配玉米，干部不和社员商量，引起很多意见。这次他们学到了群众路线的工作方法，在分配早稻的时候就和社员商量，结果有四十户社员自动报名暂时不要稻子，先让分给无粮户吃，这就改变了过去分配起来困难的局面。很多社员提出了合理化建议。骆墅乡、亭子乡不少农业社的社员建议干部在来年推广粳稻品种的时候，要考虑肥料、技术、土壤等方面的条件，不要光凭热情办事。保华乡和平第一农业社社员提出，今冬明春的副业生产社里应该早作打算。这些建议都引起了社里领导方面的重视。
    句容县是今年春天基本上实现农业合作化的。合作化后，很多农业社的管理干部在新形势下滋长了骄傲自满情绪，加上任务重，办法少，工作中的强迫命令作风有了发展。根据这种情况，中共句容县委员会在8月间领导全县农业社开展关于“民主办社”问题的学习，除了布置学习文件以外，还组织工作组到重点地区去具体帮助。很多乡的中共总支书记和支部书记都亲自掌握一个社，作出样子，再在全乡推广。他们以身作则，主动检查了过去在领导办社工作中的缺点和错误。在提高思想认识的基础上，社的干部也向社员作了检讨。通过小组座谈、田头漫谈、个别交谈等方式，社员们对于“民主办社”问题展开了广泛的讨论，大部分社员对社里民主作风有缺点的干部提出了尖锐而中肯的批评意见。因此社里的民主精神得到发扬，社员爱社如家的事例越来越多。
    在这次学习中，也还有一部分农业社学得不够好，少数干部甚至不敢发动社员学习，工作缩手缩脚，社员中也有极端民主化的倾向。目前，中共句容县委员会正在领导全县农业社结合当前生产工作，继续学习“民主办社”问题。具体要求是：消除各种不利于“民主办社”的错误思想；对于不敢发动社员学习的农业社，将加强具体帮助，从头学起。
