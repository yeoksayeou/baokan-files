Sun Yat-sen was a great patriot of modern China, an outstanding democratic revolutionary, and a sincere friend of socialism. He dedicated his life to the independence and prosperity of the country and the freedom and happiness of the people.

Under the invasion of capitalist countries, backward and isolated China began its eventful modern history. The Chinese people faced not only an extremely dangerous situation, but also one that was so complex, unfamiliar, and difficult to understand. Witnessing China's backwardness and its impending doom, advanced Chinese people pondered the roots of China's poverty and weakness, the direction and future of China, and the path and power to reform China. The Chinese people found the correct answers to these questions only after a tortuous journey. On the road to pursuing truth, some political activists and thinkers of the national bourgeoisie took one step, some took two steps, and then stopped. Sun Yat-sen did not stop. Sun Yat-sen's understanding of Chinese revolution issues and his political views always deepened and developed gradually according to the needs of revolutionary practice and the progress of the times. He always stood at the forefront of the times and advanced together with the people. It can be said that the development of Sun Yat-sen's thought reflects the process of the awakening of the Chinese nation, which contains the rich experiences and lessons that the Chinese people have gained at a great cost in opposing imperialism and feudalism. It is our responsibility to inherit and carry forward the precious legacy left by Sun Yat-sen.

The "Selected Works of Sun Yat-sen" published this time eliminates the shortcomings of various "Complete Works of Sun Yat-sen" published during the Kuomintang rule. This selected works collects more than sixty important works, documents, letters, and telegrams of Sun Yat-sen, all of which have been carefully proofread, punctuated, and arranged chronologically according to the year of writing or publication. These works represent Sun Yat-sen's main thoughts in various periods, and this selected works demonstrates the glorious life of a strong warrior who worked hard, pursued the truth, and continuously progressed.

The "Letter to Li Hongzhang" and "Manifesto of the Revive China Society" (1894) included in the first volume of the selected works represent Sun Yat-sen's understanding of national affairs when he first started his political activities. Sun Yat-sen pointed out that China was in a critical situation: the powers were sharpening their teeth and tongues, attempting to annex and destroy China, while the Qing government was following old ways, corrupt, and only doing some superficial work that did not address the fundamental issues, focusing on "Westernization" based on strong ships and powerful cannons. Sun Yat-sen believed that if China wanted to strive for strength and prosperity, it should "make the best use of talent, make the best use of land, make the best use of things, and ensure smooth flow of goods." He hoped that the Qing government could adopt and implement these principles. Like the programs put forward by other advanced figures at the time, this was a program that envisioned using the path of reformism to save the country from danger and develop capitalism.

After the Qing court initially rebuked the writer of the letter and refused to change, Sun Yat-sen quickly saw that "peaceful methods were no longer feasible," and in 1895, he embarked on the revolutionary road of organizing armed uprisings. From then on, Sun Yat-sen became the target of all reactionary forces. In "Kidnapped in London" (1897), Sun Yat-sen described the first turning point in his ideological development and recorded the initial persecution he suffered.

Sun Yat-sen did not yield. At the beginning of the twentieth century, a revolutionary movement against the Qing Dynasty gradually rose. At this time, in his articles and speeches, Sun Yat-sen revealed the reactionary nature of the Qing government in more detail, put forward a clear program for establishing a democratic republic, and refuted the arguments of the constitutional monarchists against revolution and against democratic republic.

In the article "The True Solution of the Chinese Question," Sun Yat-sen listed various crimes of the Qing government in oppressing the people, pointing out that the Chinese people did not have their own government at that time. Sun Yat-sen exposed the "reform" tricks played by the Qing government. To those who were deceived by the Qing Dynasty's "reform" edicts, he said: "Those edicts are merely written documents specially used to ease the turbulent emotions of the masses. It is absolutely impossible for the Manchus to reform the country, because reform means harming them." To those who did not believe that the anti-Qing revolution would succeed, he said: "China is now on the eve of a great national movement. As long as a single spark can create a prairie fire in politics and drive the Manchu Tartars out of our country."

In documents such as the "Manifesto of the Revolutionary Alliance," Sun Yat-sen pointed out that the revolution should not only overthrow the Qing Dynasty, but also overthrow the autocratic regime and establish a free, equal, and fraternal republic. He said that the autocratic regime was the root of all darkness in Chinese politics, which was intolerable to the freedom-loving Chinese people and must be overthrown. In the articles "A Letter to My Fellow Villagers" and "The Importance of the Chinese Democratic Revolution," Sun Yat-sen angrily refuted the theory of the constitutional monarchists who despised the people and said that the people did not have the ability to exercise democratic rights. He said: "Furthermore, the people of the Philippines, who are indigenous people, can resist the two great powers of Spain and the United States to seek independence and build a republic. The black people in North America, who were as stupid as deer and pigs in the past, can now all become free people. Saying that China cannot be a republic is slandering the Chinese people as being inferior to the Filipinos and North American black slaves, alas!"

Sun Yat-sen did not think that everything would be fine once a democratic government was established. When he was in exile in Europe and the United States, he saw the scourge of various capitalist countries—unequal distribution of wealth—and came into contact with socialist theories, and sincerely sympathized with socialism. In "Preface to *Min Bao*" and "The Three Principles of the People and the Future of China," Sun Yat-sen said that if the "social problem" is not solved well, then the result of industrial development and civilized progress will lead to the rich becoming richer and the poor becoming poorer, and the dictatorship of a few rich people will appear, and the people will still not get equal happiness. This is what Sun Yat-sen was unwilling to see. He put forward the program of equalizing land rights, believing that the implementation of this program could "ensure that every family has enough to eat and every person has a place to live within the four seas," and "the political revolution and social revolution can be accomplished in one battle."

Sun Yat-sen summarized these propositions as nationalism, democracy, and people's livelihood. The Three Principles of the People was the first bourgeois democratic revolutionary program in Chinese history, and its core was revolutionary democracy. Only by realizing nationalism with the aim of overthrowing the Qing Dynasty, the running dog of imperialism, can a democratic country be established. Only by realizing the equalization of land rights, which originated from democracy and whose actual content was to oppose the monopoly of land by feudal landlords, can democracy be upheld to the end, and the people's livelihood is a supplement to democracy. Sun Yat-sen's program reflected the Chinese people's desire to oppose imperialism, strive for national independence, oppose autocracy, strive for democratic rights, oppose exploitation and poverty, and strive for freedom and happiness. Therefore, Lenin called it "a truly great system of thought of a truly great people." In Sun Yat-sen's own way of expression, that is, the "three major principles are all based on the people" in the preface to *Min Bao*.

Sun Yat-sen's clear revolutionary program encouraged and united the broad revolutionary elements. Embracing the ideals put forward by Sun Yat-sen, they devoted themselves to revolutionary propaganda and organizational work. The revolutionary seeds sown by Sun Yat-sen bore fruit in 1911. The Qing Dynasty collapsed, and the two-thousand-year-old autocratic monarchy was buried.

The people responded to Sun Yat-sen's call and accomplished this great historical achievement. But waiting for Sun Yat-sen was an even more arduous struggle. The Revolution of 1911 did not fundamentally destroy the rule of imperialism and feudalism in China. The fruits of the revolution were usurped by Yuan Shikai, a warlord head supported by imperialism.

Initially, Sun Yat-sen did not see the true nature of the situation clearly. In speeches such as "People's Livelihood and Social Revolution," "Advocating the True Meaning of People's Livelihood," and "Talks on Social Revolution" published in 1912, Sun Yat-sen repeatedly stated that the overthrow of the Qing government and the establishment of the Republic of China was the realization of nationalism and democracy, and now it was necessary to strive to implement only the people's livelihood. Therefore, Sun Yat-sen tried his best to promote the equalization of land rights and the establishment of industries by the state, so as to use these measures to prevent the monopoly of capitalists and to seek the happiness of the people. This view was of course too optimistic. But it should be understood that Sun Yat-sen was completely different from those politicians who abandoned their original revolutionary aspirations. It was because of insufficient experience and insufficient understanding that he believed that imperialist countries would agree with China's path to independence and prosperity, and that once the emperor was overthrown, the Republic of China had truly been established, and thus he believed that the national and democratic revolutions had been completed. Therefore, as soon as Yuan Shikai's rebellious behavior of destroying the democratic system was exposed, Sun Yat-sen immediately began the struggle against Yuan Shikai.

From "Letter to Huang Xing," "Proclamation to Punish Yuan," "Second Declaration to Punish Yuan," and "Declaration of Protecting the Constitution," we can see that Sun Yat-sen was so indignant and grieved at the warlords' tyranny, the people's suffering, and the Republic of China being in danger, and the difficulties he encountered in the struggle against the warlords were so serious. When Sun Yat-sen planned the campaign to punish Yuan, his old comrades all advocated prudence and slow progress, "some trusted Yuan and planned for his future effectiveness, some thought that his power could not be offended and the only way was to deal with him evasively and slowly seek remedy, some only hoped for the current peace and did not want to have a decisive move," and there were also "traitors who lost their integrity and became spies," and so on. Sun Yat-sen was not held back by these people, and he launched the campaign to punish Yuan. In the past, Sun Yat-sen was the first to call for the overthrow of the autocratic government of the Qing Dynasty, and now Sun Yat-sen was also the first to raise the banner against Yuan and protect the Constitution to save the achievements of the Revolution of 1911. But at this time, Sun Yat-sen still did not understand that it was necessary to rely on the people in the struggle, and he did not understand that the restoration of the Provisional Constitution and the National Assembly, which he tried his best to strive for, could not fundamentally eliminate the warlords. Therefore, Sun Yat-sen's struggle failed.

In the dark years, Sun Yat-sen planned how to establish a strong and true republic. From 1917 to 1919, he wrote "The Fundamentals of National Reconstruction." Sun Yat-sen believed that it was necessary to overcome people's lack of firm belief in the revolutionary purpose and their failure to implement it effectively, and it was necessary to overcome the fear of difficulties and to revitalize the revolutionary spirit. So he wrote "Sun Wen's Doctrine." In order to allow the people to learn the basic knowledge of exercising civil rights, he wrote "Preliminary Knowledge of Civil Rights," which showed his sincere desire to see the Chinese people become the true masters of the country. "The Industrial Plan" was the first comprehensive plan for China's industrialization, which showed that even during the period when he was completely excluded from political power, Sun Yat-sen still cherished the ardent desire to transform China into a strong industrial country.

It was at this time that the May Fourth Movement broke out. The May Fourth Movement showed the revolutionary power of the masses, raised the broad masses' understanding of imperialism, and aroused the call for fundamental reform of China. Under this situation, Sun Yat-sen began to adjust his steps and prepare to continue to move forward based on his years of revolutionary struggle experience.

In the speeches entitled "The First Step of Transforming China is Only Revolution" and "The Urgent Task of Saving the Country" published in October 1919, Sun Yat-sen criticized the incompleteness of the past revolution, saying that "the Republic of China in the past eight years has been in such a bad state politically because it only destroyed the ground surface and did not dig up the old soil at the bottom," and these "old soil" were bureaucrats, warlords, and politicians. He said: "To build a bright and solemn republic, we must first move these three kinds of old soil before we can establish a solid foundation." He gradually realized that there was little hope of success in talking to the warlords about maintaining the Constitution and restoring the National Assembly, so he called on the people to make up their minds early and "start the revolutionary cause again to seek fundamental reform." Sun Yat-sen saw the strength of the masses from the May Fourth Movement, and he said: "Looking at the student movement this time, it was only aroused by being stimulated, and in this very short period of time, it has reaped unparalleled huge fruits, so it can be seen that those who unite are strong."

What is particularly important is that Sun Yat-sen had already begun to feel that the wrongdoings of the warlords were supported by imperialist countries. In the "Letter to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Soviet Socialist Republic" on August 28, 1921, he wrote: "After his (Yuan Shikai—editor's note) death, the powers still support some local emperors and warlords politically and financially." In this letter, Sun Yat-sen expressed his yearning for the October Revolution and Soviet Russia. He wrote: "I hope to have private contact with you (referring to Chicherin—editor's note) and other friends in Moscow. I am paying close attention to your cause, especially the organization of your Soviets, the organization of your army and education." In the speech "Implementing the Three Principles of the People to Transform the New Country," he pointed out that "the republics of France and the United States are old-fashioned, and today only Russia is new-fashioned." These remarks are enough to show how closely Sun Yat-sen was observing and studying everything about the new socialist country of Soviet Russia at that time.

Although these understandings were not clear enough at the time, they already showed a new trend of Sun Yat-sen. With the help of Soviet Russia and the Chinese Communist Party, Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary thought and revolutionary activities underwent an important transformation at the end of 1923: he understood that to achieve revolutionary victory, he must rely on the broad masses of conscious and organized people, and must cooperate closely with the international and domestic proletariat; he saw clearly the relationship between the warlords and imperialism, and recognized that imperialism was the most ferocious enemy of the Chinese revolution. In the declarations, telegrams, and speeches included in the second volume of this selected works, Sun Yat-sen explained in detail his understanding of these two fundamental issues.

The first few articles in the second volume of the selected works are declarations and speeches published by Sun Yat-sen for the reorganization of the Kuomintang, including "Kuomintang members must not intend to become officials and make fortunes," "Declaration on the Reorganization of the Chinese Kuomintang," "Success must rely on party members, not solely on the army," "Party members should work with the army to fight," "Revolutionary success depends entirely on propagating doctrine," and "Issues on the Reorganization of the Kuomintang," and so on. In these speeches and declarations, Sun Yat-sen focused on the idea that revolution must rely on the people. He said: "Revolutionary actions have long lacked the mental strength of the people, which is no different from water without a source and a tree without roots. ... If our party wants to stand in an invincible position, the path of struggle in the future must first win the hearts of the people, so that the people of the country have the same aspirations as our party, so that the people of the country cooperate with our party and fight for the revolution together." He also said: "Because China's cause is too great, it is easy to succeed only with the strength of 400 million people, and it cannot be achieved with the strength of one or two people." Sun Yat-sen's gaining this understanding was the result of humbly learning from Soviet Russia. Sun Yat-sen not only expressed sympathy and excitement for the Russian revolution, but more importantly, after seeing the great achievements of the Russian revolution, he came to the conclusion of learning from Russia. He said: "The Russian revolutionary party not only overthrew the world's most powerful imperialist, but also solved the world's economic and political problems. This revolution is a thorough success because of its good methods," "Our revolution must learn from it." In Sun Yat-sen's view, the most important experience of the Russian revolution was that the Russian revolutionary party was able to rely on the people. He said: "The Communist Party and the Russian people have the same views, so the Communist Party has been able to achieve success." Therefore, Sun Yat-sen repeatedly stated that the only purpose of reorganizing the Kuomintang was to take Soviet Russia as a model to establish a revolutionary political party that had close ties with the masses. He emphasized that the reorganized Kuomintang should do a good job in propaganda work for the people, and criticized the past mistake of only relying on army struggle.

In January 1924, the First National Congress of the Chinese Kuomintang, in which members of the Communist Party participated, was held. The congress passed the "Declaration of the First National Congress of the Chinese Kuomintang." In the declaration, Sun Yat-sen for the first time recognized that imperialism was the mortal enemy of the Chinese revolution. He described the political and economic aggression of imperialism against China, and accurately analyzed the interrelationship between imperialism and warlords. He said, "The warlords themselves are contrary to the interests of the people and are not enough to survive on their own, so all warlords are related to the imperialism of the powers. ... The powers also use them to provide large loans to fill their military expenses, so that internal strife in China continues, so as to seize interests and occupy spheres of influence. From this point of view, it can be seen that China's internal strife is actually created by the powers." The declaration also criticized the constitutionalists, the provincial autonomy faction, and the peaceful reunification faction one by one, pointing out that as long as the warlords exist for one day, the constitution will not be effective for one day, pointing out that the so-called "provincial autonomy" is just to split China and let the warlords of various factions occupy one side, and the so-called "peaceful reunification" is just a reconciliation of interests between the warlords, which has nothing to do with the people. These show that Sun Yat-sen had completely abandoned his illusions about the warlords. The declaration pointed out that in order to complete the task of opposing imperialism and opposing the warlords, it is necessary to mobilize farmers and workers to participate in the struggle. Therefore, it is necessary to absorb farmers and workers into the Kuomintang, to support the organizations of peasants and workers, and to improve the lives of peasants and workers. Based on this basic spirit of relying on the people to carry out the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal struggle, Sun Yat-sen re-explained the Three Principles of the People. It is stipulated that the meaning of nationalism is to oppose imperialism and the liberation of all ethnic groups in China; democracy is to establish a people's republic that is owned by the common people and not privately owned by a few, which should give the people full democratic rights, but deprive all rights of the running dogs of imperialism and warlords; the people's livelihood is to implement land to the tiller and regulate capital.

The First National Congress of the Chinese Kuomintang was a dividing line in the history of Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary struggle. After this, Sun Yat-sen was advancing on a completely correct revolutionary path, and therefore his revolutionary enthusiasm was highly developed.

After the congress, Sun Yat-sen made many speeches to revolutionary cadres, workers, peasants, soldiers, and students. Included in this selected works are: "The Responsibility of Saving the Country and Saving the People Lies with the Revolutionary Army," "Women Must Understand the Three Principles of the People," "The Three Principles of the People," "The Harm of Unequal Treaties Suffered by Chinese Workers," "Opening Speech at the Army Military Academy," "Great Alliance of Peasants," "Tillers Should Have Their Land," and so on. In these speeches, Sun Yat-sen promoted the revolutionary Three Principles of the People that thoroughly opposed imperialism and opposed the warlords, and promoted the three major policies of alliance with Russia, alliance with the Communist Party, and assistance to peasants and workers. In the "Nationalism" speech, Sun Yat-sen explained that only Soviet Russia was a sincere friend of the Chinese people's struggle for liberation. He said: "Since the European War, the Russians themselves overthrew imperialism and turned the imperialist country into a new socialist country, ... changed the old policy of using force in the past to a new policy of peace. This new policy not only has no ambition to invade other countries, but also supports the weak and suppresses the strong to uphold justice." "The new doctrine of Russia is to use reason to extinguish power." Based on this understanding, Sun Yat-sen especially emphasized the alliance with Soviet Russia. In the "Reply to the Telegram of the Soviet Russian Representative in Beijing," "Handwritten Letter to Chiang Kai-shek," and "Welcome to the Russian Warship," we can see Sun Yat-sen's emphasis on the support given by Soviet Russia to the Chinese people and the establishment of the friendship of struggle between the Chinese and Russian people. In the "People's Livelihood" speech, Sun Yat-sen criticized the stubborn elements in the Kuomintang who opposed cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. In the speech "The Harm of Unequal Treaties Suffered by Chinese Workers," Sun Yat-sen said: "Now that the workers have organizations, they can be the guide of the country and the vanguard of the people to abolish the unequal treaties between China and foreign countries and fight on the front line." In the speeches "Great Alliance of Peasants" and "Tillers Should Have Their Land," Sun Yat-sen clearly pointed out that the peasants were the foundation of the Chinese revolution, and he called on the peasants to organize themselves like the workers.

Sun Yat-sen not only carried out extensive propaganda activities, but also immediately devoted himself to the actual struggle against imperialism and warlords. In August 1924, with the support of imperialism, the Guangdong Chamber of Commerce attempted to overthrow the revolutionary government by force. Imperialism originally wanted to use force to intimidate Sun Yat-sen into submission. However, the result was completely the opposite. The naked aggression of imperialism only made Sun Yat-sen see more concretely the ugly and counter-revolutionary true face of imperialism, thereby inspiring his fighting spirit. Since then, his words and deeds against imperialism have become more distinct, profound, fierce, and powerful. Sun Yat-sen resolutely suppressed the rebellion of the Chamber of Commerce and published the "Declaration to the Outside World on the Guangzhou Chamber of Commerce Incident" and the "Protest Letter to the MacDonald Government," angrily denouncing the British imperialism's support for the Chamber of Commerce and its intimidation of the Guangdong revolutionary government. He declared: "Now a period will begin, which is the greatest obstacle to the work of striving to overthrow the interference of imperialism in China and eliminate the history of completing the revolution." On September 18, 1924, Sun Yat-sen issued the "Northern Expedition Declaration," calling for the Northern Expedition, pointing out that "The purpose of this war is not only to destroy Cao and Wu, but also to ensure that after the destruction of Cao and Wu, there will never be anyone who continues the evil forces of counter-revolution; in other words, the purpose of this war is not only to overthrow the warlords, but also to overthrow the imperialism on which the warlords depend." In November 1924, Sun Yat-sen launched a movement to convene a national conference and abolish unequal treaties. In order to achieve this goal, Sun Yat-sen went to Beijing at the risk of his life, carrying a serious illness. In the "Declaration on Going North" and the "National Conference as a Solution to China's Internal Strife," "Conversation with Reporters from Nagasaki Shimbun," "The Causes of China's Internal Strife," and "Conversation with Reporters from Moji Shimbun" published along the way in Shanghai and Japan, one can also see Sun Yat-sen's spirit of revolutionary courage.

On March 12, 1925, the generation of revolutionary giants passed away. On his deathbed, Sun Yat-sen left behind two immortal documents—the will on the need to awaken the masses and realize the declaration of the First National Congress of the Kuomintang, and the letter expressing the hope to cooperate with the Soviet Union forever. These two documents occupy the final pages of this selected works, leaving readers with a deep sense of admiration.

Sun Yat-sen's thought is characterized by continuous progress with the development of the times, and the more it progresses, the more mature it becomes. Therefore, shortcomings that are not mature enough can often be found in his writings. This kind of shortcoming is also unavoidable in fact, and we should look at it historically and understand it correctly.

    孙中山选集介绍
    王忍之
    孙中山先生是近代中国的伟大的爱国者，是杰出的民主主义的革命家，是社会主义的真诚的朋友。他为了国家的独立富强、人民的自由幸福奋斗了一生。
    落后、闭塞的中国，在资本主义国家的侵略下，开始了多灾多难的近代历史。中国人面临着的不仅是一个极端危险的局面，并且是一个那样复杂、那样陌生和难于理解的局面。眼看着中国的落后和濒于灭亡的危机，先进的中国人思索着什么是中国贫弱的根源，什么是中国的方向和前途，什么是改革中国的道路和力量。中国人民是在经过了一段曲折的路程以后才找到对这些问题的正确答案的。在追求真理的道路上，民族资产阶级的政治活动家和思想家有的走了一步，有的走了二步，就停下了。孙中山没有停下。孙中山对于中国革命问题的认识，他的政治主张，总是能根据革命实践的需要，跟着时势的进展而逐渐深入和发展。他始终站在时代的前列和人民一道前进。可以说，孙中山思想的发展反映了中国民族的觉醒过程，其中包含着中国人民在付出了浩大的代价以后所取得的反对帝国主义、反对封建主义的丰富的经验和教训。继承和发扬孙中山留下来的珍贵遗产是我们的责任。
    这次出版的孙中山选集排除了国民党统治时期出版的各种“孙中山全集”的缺点。这部选集收集了孙中山的重要著作、文件、函电六十多篇，都经过了仔细的校订，加上了标点符号，按照写作或发表的年月先后来编排。这些著作代表了孙中山在各时期的主要思想，这部选集表现出了一个坚强的战士艰苦奋斗、追求真理、不断进步的光辉的一生。
    收入选集上卷的“上李鸿章书”、“兴中会宣言”（1894年），代表了孙中山刚开始政治活动时对于国事的认识。孙中山指出，中国是处在一个危急的形势下：列强正在磨牙啮舌，企图并吞灭亡中国，而清朝政府却因循苟且、腐败不堪，只会做一些装璜门面舍本逐末的工夫，办一些以船坚炮利为内容的“洋务”。孙中山认为，中国要奋发图强，就要做到“人尽其才、地尽其利、物尽其用、货畅其流”，他希望清政府能够采纳和实行这些原则。同当时其他先进人物所提出的纲领一样，这是一个设想以改良主义道路来挽救国家免于危亡的、发展资本主义的纲领。
    在清廷最初叱责上书者和拒绝变法之后，孙中山很快就看清了“和平方法，无可复施”，并于1895年走上了组织武装起义的革命道路。从此孙中山成为一切反动势力摧残的对象。在“伦敦被难记”（1897年）这一著作中，孙中山叙述了自己思想发展的第一个转折，记录了他受到的最初的迫害。
    孙中山没有屈服。二十世纪初，逐渐兴起了反对清王朝的革命运动。这时，孙中山在文章和讲演中更详细地揭露了清政府的反动本质，提出了建立民主共和国的明确纲领，驳斥了君主立宪派反对革命、反对民主共和的论调。
    在“中国问题的真解决”一文中，孙中山列举了清朝政府压迫人民的各种罪行，指出中国人现在并没有自己的政府。孙中山揭穿了清政府扮演的“变法”把戏。对于那些被清朝的“维新”上谕所迷惑的人，他说道：“那些诏旨只不过是专门用以缓和民众骚动情绪的具文而已。由满洲人来将国家加以改革，那是绝对不可能的，因为改革意味着给他们以损害”。对于那些不相信反清革命会成功的人，他说道：“中国现今正处在一次伟大的民族运动的前夕，只要星星之火就能在政治上造成燎原之势，将满洲鞑子从我们的国土上驱逐出去”。
    在“同盟会宣言”等文件中，孙中山指出，革命不只要推翻清王朝，并且要推翻专制政体，建立一个自由、平等、博爱的民国。他说，专制政体是中国政治上种种黑暗的根源，是爱好自由的中国人民不能忍受的，是非要将它打倒不可的。在“敬告同乡书”、“中国民主革命之重要”两篇文章中，孙中山愤怒地驳斥了君主立宪派轻视人民、说人民没有能力行使民主权利的理论。他说道：“且夫菲律宾之人，土番也，而能拒西班牙、美利坚二大国，以谋独立而建共和。北美之黑人，前此皆蠢如鹿豕，今皆得为自由民。言中国不可共和，是诬中国人曾菲律宾人北美黑奴之不若也，乌乎可！”
    孙中山并不认为一旦建立了民主政体就万事大吉。他在流亡欧美时就看到了资本主义各国的祸害——贫富不均，就接触到了社会主义学说，并且诚恳地同情社会主义。在“民报发刊词”、“三民主义与中国前途”中，孙中山说，如果不很好地解决“社会问题”，那么工业发达、文明进步的结果就会造成富者愈富、贫者愈贫，就会出现少数富人的专制，人民仍然得不到平等幸福。这是孙中山所不愿意的。他提出了平均地权的纲领，认为实现了这个纲领就能“家给人足，四海之内，无一夫不获其所”，“就能举政治革命、社会革命毕其功于一役”。
    孙中山把这些主张概括地称为民族主义、民权主义、民生主义。这个三民主义是中国历史上第一个资产阶级民主革命纲领，它的核心是革命的民主主义。只有实现了以推翻帝国主义的走狗清王朝为目的的民族主义，才有可能建立民主主义的国家。只有实现了出发于民主主义以反对封建地主对土地的垄断为实际内容的平均地权，才能把民主主义坚持到底，民生主义是民主主义的补充。孙中山的这个纲领反映了中国人民反对帝国主义，争取民族独立、反对专制主义、争取民主权利，反对剥削贫困，争取自由幸福的愿望。所以列宁称它为“一个真正伟大的人民底真正伟大的思想体系”。按照孙中山自己的表达方式，那就是民报发刊词中所说的“三大主义皆基本于民”。
    孙中山的明确的革命纲领鼓舞了、团结了广大的革命分子。他们怀抱着孙中山所提出的理想，奋不顾身地进行革命的宣传和组织工作。孙中山播下的革命种子，在1911年产生了它的后果。清王朝垮台了，二千年来的君主专制政体被埋葬了。
    人民响应孙中山的号召，做成了这个具有巨大历史意义的业迹。可是等待着孙中山的是更艰苦的斗争。辛亥革命没有根本上摧毁帝国主义封建主义在中国的统治。革命成果被在帝国主义支持下的军阀头子袁世凯所篡夺。
    最初，孙中山并没有看清楚时局的真象。在1912年发表的“民生主义与社会革命”、“提倡民生主义之真义”、“社会革命谈”等演说中，孙中山反复地说明清政府的推翻，中华民国的建立，就是民族主义民权主义的实现，现在要努力实行的只是民生主义。于是孙中山尽力宣传平均地权和由国家兴办实业，以便用这些措施来防止资本家的垄断，来求得民众的幸福。这种看法当然是过于乐观了。但是应当了解，孙中山完全不同于那些抛却革命初心的政客。他是因为经验不够，认识不足，才相信帝国主义国家会赞同中国走向独立富强，才相信皇帝既已打倒民国就已真正建立，从而认为民族民权革命已经完成。所以袁世凯破坏民主制度的叛逆行为一经暴露，孙中山就立即开始了反对袁世凯的斗争。
    从“致黄兴书”、“讨袁檄文”、“第二次讨袁宣言”、“护法宣言”中，我们看到，孙中山对于军阀的横行霸道、人民涂炭、民国垂危，是那样的愤慨和痛心，他在进行反对军阀的斗争时所遇到的困难又是那样严重。在孙中山策划讨袁起义时，他的老同志却都主张持重缓进，“有信赖袁氏而策其后效者，有以为其锋不可犯、势惟与之委蛇而徐图补救者，有但幸目前之和平而不欲有决裂之举者”，也有“亏节堕行，为伥为侦之败类”，不一而足。孙中山没有被这些人拖住，他发动了讨袁起义。以往，第一个号召推翻清朝专制政府的是孙中山，现在第一个揭起反袁和护法的大旗来挽救辛亥革命成果的也是孙中山。可是这时孙中山还不懂得在斗争中必须依靠人民，还不了解他竭力争取的恢复民元约法和国会并不能根本上消灭军阀。因此，孙中山的斗争遭到了失败。
    在黑暗的年月里，孙中山筹划着怎样才能建立一个强大的真正的民国。1917—1919年，他写作了“建国方略”。孙中山认为必须克服人们对于革命宗旨信仰不笃、奉行不力的毛病，必须破除畏惧困难的心理，振起革命精神。于是他写了
  “孙文学说”。为了让人民能学会行使民权的基础知识，他写了“民权初步”，表现了期待中国人民成为国家的真正主人的真诚愿望。“实业计划”是中国工业化的第一个全面的计划，它表明孙中山即使在完全被排斥于政权之外的时期，仍旧怀抱着把中国改造成为一个工业强国的热烈愿望。
    就在这个时候，五四运动爆发了。五四运动显示了群众的革命威力，提高了广大人民对于帝国主义的认识，引起了根本改造中国的呼声。在这种形势下，孙中山根据多年来的革命斗争经验，开始调整自己的步伐，准备继续前进。
    在1919年10月发表的题为“改造中国之第一步只有革命”和“救国之急务”的演说中，孙中山批判了过去革命的不彻底，他说“八年以来的中华民国，政治不良到这个地位，实因为单破坏地面，没有掘地底陈土的缘故”，这些“陈土”就是官僚、军阀和政客。他说：“要建筑灿烂庄严的民国，须先搬去这三种陈土，才能立起坚固的基础来”。他逐渐了解到与军阀谈维护约法和恢复国会，成功的希望很小，因此他号召人民要早下决心，“重新开始革命事业，以求根本改革也”。孙中山从五四运动中看到了群众的力量，他说：“试观今次学生运动，不过因被激而兴，而于此甚短之期间，收绝伦之巨果，可知结合者即强也”。
    特别重要的是，孙中山这时已经开始感到军阀的作恶多端是受帝国主义国家支持的。在1921年8月28日“致俄罗斯苏维埃社会主义共和国外交部信”中，他写道：“他（指袁世凯—引者）死了以后，列强仍然在政治上和财政上支持一些土皇帝和军阀”。在这封信里面，孙中山表现了对十月革命和苏俄的向往。他写道：“我希望与您（指齐契林—引者）及莫斯科的其他友人获得私人的接触。我非常注意你们的事业，特别是你们苏维埃的组织，你们军队和教育的组织”。在“实行三民主义改造新国家”的演说中，他指出，“法、美共和国皆旧式的，今日惟俄国为新式的”。这些言论足以表明当时孙中山多么注意地观察着研究着社会主义新国家苏俄的一切。
    当时这些认识尽管还不够明确，但是已经显示出了孙中山的一个新的动向。在苏俄和中国共产党的帮助下，孙中山的革命思想和革命活动在1923年底发生了一个重要的转变：他懂得了要取得革命胜利就必须依靠广大的有觉悟有组织的人民群众，必须同国际和国内的无产阶级密切合作；他看清楚了军阀同帝国主义的关系，认定帝国主义是中国革命的最凶恶的敌人。在收入这部选集下卷的宣言、文电、讲演中，孙中山详尽地说明了他对于这两个根本问题的认识。
    选集下卷的最初几篇文章是孙中山为了改组国民党而发表的宣言和演说，其中包括“国民党员不可存心做官发财”、“中国国民党改组宣言”、“要靠党员成功，不专靠军队成功”、“党员应协同军队来奋斗”、“革命成功全赖宣传主义”、“国民党改组问题”等。在这些演讲和宣言中，孙中山着重发挥了革命必须依靠人民的思想。他说：“革命行动，久缺人民心力，无异无源之水，无根之木。……吾党想立于不败之地，今后奋斗之途径，必先要得民心，要国内人民与吾党同一个志愿，要使国内人民皆与吾党合作，同为革命奋斗”。他又说：“因为中国的事业太大，要用四万万人的力，才容易做成功，不是一两个人的力，可以做得到的”。孙中山的得到这个认识，是虚心向苏俄学习的结果。孙中山不仅对俄国革命表示同情和兴奋，尤其重要的是他在看到俄国革命的重大成就以后，就得出了学习俄国的结论。他说道：“俄国革命党不仅把世界最大威权之帝国主义推翻，且进而解决世界经济政治诸问题。这种革命，真是彻底的成功，皆因其方法良好之故”，“吾等革命，一定要学他”。在孙中山看来，俄国革命的最重要的经验就是俄国革命党能依靠人民。他说：“共产党与俄国人民主张一致，所以共产党得告厥成功。”因此孙中山再三说明改组国民党之唯一目的是以苏俄为模范，建立一个与群众有密切联系的革命政党。他强调改组后的国民党要做好对人民的宣传工作，批判了过去只依靠军队斗争的错误。
    1924年1月，召开了有共产党人参加的中国国民党第一次全国代表大会，大会通过了“中国国民党第一次全国代表大会宣言”。在宣言中，孙中山第一次认定帝国主义是中国革命的死敌。他描述了帝国主义对于中国的政治和经济的侵略，精确地分析了帝国主义与军阀的相互关系。他说“军阀本身与人民利益相反，不足以自存，故凡为军阀者，莫不与列强之帝国主义发生关系。……而列强亦即利用之，资以大借款，充其军费，使中国内乱纠纷不已，以攫取利权，各占势力范围。由此点观测，可知中国内乱，实有造于列强”。宣言还逐一地批评了立宪派、联省自治派、和平统一派，指出只要军阀一日存在，宪法就一日不生效力，指出所谓“联省自治”不过是使中国分裂、让各派军阀各据一方，所谓“和平统一”不过是军阀之间利益的调和，与民众无关。这些表明，孙中山已经完全抛弃了对军阀的幻想。宣言指出，要完成反对帝国主义、反对军阀的任务，就要动员农夫和工人参加斗争。因此，要吸收农夫和工人参加国民党，要赞助农民工人的组织，要改善农工的生活。本着这种依靠人民进行反帝反封建的基本精神，孙中山重新解释了三民主义。规定民族主义的意义是要反对帝国主义和中国各民族自求解放；民权主义是要建立一个为平民所共有、非少数人所得而私的人民共和国，它应当给人民以充分的民主权利，但要剥夺帝国主义和军阀的走狗的一切权利；民生主义是要实行耕者有其田和节制资本。
    中国国民党第一次全国代表大会是孙中山革命斗争史上的一个分界线，在这以后，孙中山是在一条完全正确的革命道路上前进，因而他的革命热诚得到了高度的发扬。
    代表大会以后，孙中山对革命干部、工人、农民、士兵、学生作了很多次演讲。收入这部选集的有：“救国救民之责任在革命军”、“女子要明白三民主义”、“三民主义”、“中国工人所受不平等条约之害”、“陆军军官学校开学演说”、“农民大联合”、“耕者要有其田”等。在这些演说中，孙中山宣传了彻底反对帝国主义、反对军阀的革命的三民主义，宣传了联俄、联共、扶助农工的三大政策。在“民族主义”讲演中，孙中山说明了只有苏俄才是中国人民争取解放斗争的真诚的朋友。他说：“自欧战以后，俄国人自己推翻帝国主义，把帝国主义的国家变成新社会主义的国家，……把从前用武力的旧政策，改用和平的新政策。这种新政策，不但没有侵略各国的野心，并且抑强扶弱主持公道。”“俄国的新主义是主张以公理扑灭强权的”。基于这样的认识，孙中山特别强调和苏俄的联合。在“复苏俄驻北京代表电”、“致蒋介石手札”、“欢迎俄舰祝词”等文件中，我们都能看到，孙中山对苏俄给予中国人民的支援和建立中俄人民之间的战斗友谊的重视。在“民生主义”的讲演中，孙中山批评了国民党内反对国共合作的顽固分子。在“中国工人所受不平等条约之害”的演说中，孙中山说：“工人既有了团体，要废除中外不平等的条约，便可以做全国的指导，作国民的先锋，在最前的阵线上去奋斗”。在“农民大联合”、“耕者要有其田”的演说中，孙中山明确地指出农民是中国革命的基础，他号召农民要像工人一样组织起来。
    孙中山不仅进行了广泛的宣传活动，而且立即投入了反帝、反军阀的实际斗争。1924年8月，在帝国主义支持下，广东商团企图用武力推翻革命政府。帝国主义本来想用武力恫吓来使孙中山屈服。可是，结果完全相反，帝国主义的露骨的侵略行为，只是使孙中山更加具体地看到了帝国主义的狰狞的反革命的真面目，从而激励了他的斗志。从此，他的反对帝国主义的言论和行动更为鲜明深刻，更为猛烈、更为有力了。孙中山坚决地镇压了商团叛变，发表了“为广州商团事件对外宣言”和“向麦克唐纳尔政府抗议书”，愤怒地斥责了英帝国主义对于商团的支持和对广东革命政府的恫吓，他声明道：“今将开始一时期，为努力推翻帝国主义之干涉中国、扫除完成革命之历史的工作之最大障碍。”1924年9月18日孙中山发表“北伐宣言”，号召北伐，指出“此战之目的，不仅在复灭曹吴，尤在曹吴复灭之后，永无同样继起之人，以继续反革命之恶势力；换言之，此战之目的，不仅在推倒军阀，尤在推倒军阀所赖以生存之帝国主义。”1924年11月孙中山发起了召开国民会议、废除不平等条约运动。为了实现这个目的，孙中山冒着危险，抱着重病，前往北京。在“北上宣言”以及路过上海、日本所发表的“国民会议为解决中国内乱之法”、“与长崎新闻记者的谈话”、“中国内乱之原因”、“与门司新闻记者的谈话”中，同样可以看到孙中山这种勇往直前的革命精神。
    1925年3月12日，一代革命巨人逝世了。临终时，孙中山留下了两个不朽的文献——关于必须唤起民众，实现国民党第一次全国代表大会宣言的遗嘱和希望与苏联永远合作的遗书。这两个文件占居着这部选集的最后的篇幅，使读者感到深深的敬仰。
    孙中山的思想是以随着时代的发展而不断进步为特征的，越到后来越成熟。所以，在他的著作中常常可以发现不够成熟的缺点。这种缺点也是事实上所不可免的，我们应当历史主义地来看待它，正确地去认识它。
