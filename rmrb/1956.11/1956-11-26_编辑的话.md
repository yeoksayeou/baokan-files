    Editor's Note
    Organizers of the Masses' Life
    We should care about the actual life of the masses and should become organizers of the masses' life.
    Today, the news about the Party organization of Shaanxi Province visiting the masses in the mountainous areas provides an example in this regard. Through the visits, they understood the problems in the lives of the masses in the mountainous areas, solicited the opinions of the masses in the mountainous areas on past work, and helped the masses solve some of the difficulties that should be solved. In this way, the relevant Party organizations will be able to guide the work in the mountainous areas more effectively, and the masses in the mountainous areas will also be more motivated to carry out the construction of the mountainous areas. May this style of caring for the lives of the masses continue to be upheld, so that we truly become the organizers of the masses' life.
    Lost Property Returned
    Shanghai was once known as a city of sin before liberation. Here, gangsters, bandits, and swindlers ran rampant, and people's property often disappeared without a trace. However, in the new society, everything has changed dramatically. It was unimaginable in the past that lost property could be found and returned. Now, banners of "picking up money and not pocketing it" have replaced signs of "beware of pickpockets." This year, more than four thousand people who lost things have recovered their lost property.
    This matter illustrates the following truth: After the fundamental change in the social system, as long as we are good at education and guidance, the social atmosphere can be changed. In the seven years since liberation, under the leadership and education of the Party, the economic life of the people of Shanghai has been considerably improved, and their political awareness has been increasingly enhanced; people's spiritual outlook has changed, and the social atmosphere has also shifted accordingly. The return of such a large amount of lost property to its owners is a solid example.

    群众生活的组织者
    我们应当关怀群众的实际生活，并且应当成为群众生活的组织者。
    今天，陕西省的党组织访问山区群众的新闻，正是在这方面提供了一个范例。他们通过访问，了解了山区群众生活中的问题，征求了山区群众对过去工作的意见，帮助群众解决了一些应当解决的困难。这样，有关的党组织将会更加切实地指导山区的工作，山区群众也将会更加奋发地进行山区的建设。愿这种关怀群众生活的作风继续坚持下去，使我们真正的成为群众生活的组织者。
    失物送上门
    上海，解放前曾被称为罪恶的都市。在这里，流氓、盗匪、拆白党到处横行，人们的财物往往不翼而飞。可是，在新社会，一切都大大地改变了。遗失了的财物能够寻找回来，这在过去是多么不可想像的一件事。现在却是“拾金不昧”的锦旗代替了“谨防扒手”的牌子，今年来，四千多个遗失东西的人领回了自己的失物。
    这件事情说明了这样一个道理：在社会制度根本改变以后，只要善于教育、引导，社会风气是可以转变的。解放七年来，上海人民在党的领导和教育下，经济生活得到了相当的改善，政治觉悟日益提高；人的精神面貌改变了，社会风气也随着转移。这样大量的失物归还原主，就是一个铁的例证。
