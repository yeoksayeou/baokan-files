    Commemorating the Great Pioneer of Revolution - Mr. Sun Yat-sen
    Cheng Qian
    In the course of my life, I spent a long period following Mr. Sun Yat-sen in revolutionary activities. Mr. Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary demeanor and his voice and smile have left a deep impression on my mind, urging me to closely follow the pace of the people's revolution.
    In 1905, I was studying at the Zhenwu School in Tokyo, Japan. At that time, Mr. Sun Yat-sen had already organized the Chinese Revolutionary Alliance in Japan. Through the introduction of Huang Xing and Song Jiaoren, my classmate Jiang Jun and I met Mr. Sun Yat-sen for the first time in a Chinese restaurant in Yokohama. Mr. Sun Yat-sen warmly talked to us about the purpose of the revolution. I was deeply impressed by Mr. Sun Yat-sen's remarks at the time, and a young revolutionary enthusiasm suddenly ignited in my heart. Soon, I joined the Tongmenghui (Revolutionary Alliance).
    In 1912, after Mr. Sun Yat-sen resigned from the post of Provisional President, I saw him for the second time in Shanghai. Mr. Sun Yat-sen said to me: "As long as Yuan Shikai doesn't become emperor, it will be easy to handle. Now there is a parliament and a provisional constitution. The president is elected. If he is not elected, he will be powerless." Who knew that when Yuan Shikai discovered that the Kuomintang had won the "election" in the parliament, he "realized the mistake of neglecting the election" and instigated Zhao Bingjun to organize assassins to assassinate Song Jiaoren, who was enthusiastic about organizing a party cabinet, in Shanghai in the spring of 1913. After the Song case occurred, the four provinces of Guangdong, Hunan, Jiangxi, and Hubei formed an alliance and launched a punitive expedition against Yuan Shikai, which failed within a few months.
    After the failure of the punitive expedition against Yuan Shikai, Mr. Sun Yat-sen went to Japan again and abolished the Kuomintang in Tokyo, reorganizing it into the Chinese Revolutionary Party, and personally drafted the general charter of the Chinese Revolutionary Party. As everyone knows, after the Revolution of 1911, the Tongmenghui was reorganized into the Kuomintang. For a time, a large number of bureaucratic politicians poured in, the good and the bad were mixed, and the Kuomintang completely lost its revolutionary combat effectiveness. In view of this, Mr. Sun Yat-sen proposed the method of "rectifying the source" in the "Declaration of the Chinese Revolutionary Party": (1) Rejecting bureaucrats; (2) Eliminating pseudo-revolutionary parties to achieve complete unity. In order to consolidate the party and improve its combat effectiveness, Mr. Sun Yat-sen put forward this method and some corresponding party membership procedures and rituals. Under the circumstances at the time, it should be said that it was well-intentioned and completely correct. However, this approach was misunderstood by some revolutionaries, so they were unwilling to join the Chinese Revolutionary Party. In this way, some conspirators took advantage of it to create discord among comrades. Therefore, Huang Xing and others did not join the Chinese Revolutionary Party later. (I did not join the Chinese Revolutionary Party until 1919.) Because of these things, Mr. Sun Yat-sen also wrote a sincere letter to Huang Xing, encouraging him to continue his revolutionary work. Later, when Huang Xing passed away, Mr. Sun Yat-sen was very sad. He said to me: "Huang Keqiang is the most powerful, talented, and brave revolutionary, and a good helper of mine." When offering sacrifices to Huang Xing, in addition to the public memorial oration, Mr. Sun Yat-sen also personally wrote a sorrowful memorial oration. Mr. Sun Yat-sen's broad-mindedness in uniting comrades and his sincere feelings for comrades can be seen from this.
    In 1916, at No. 63 Huanlong Road, Shanghai, Mr. Sun Yat-sen talked to us again about the strategy and tactics of the revolution. Mr. Sun Yat-sen said: "The success or failure of the revolution mainly depends on the doctrine, that is, there must be a political program; what is related to the doctrine is the support of the people; as for advocating great righteousness in the world, it depends on the strategic points, establishing a government, and openly raising the banner." Mr. Sun Yat-sen advocated occupying cities as strongholds first. He analyzed the situation of several major cities to us. He said: "It is best to launch an uprising in the capital, seize power, and call on the whole country, which can be successful in one fell swoop, but Beijing has been under tyrannical rule for too long, the atmosphere is not open, and the reactionary military and police are strict, making it difficult to succeed. Wuchang is the birthplace of the first uprising in 1911, but later the warlords occupied Beijing, and it soon became ineffective. Nanjing is located in the southeast and is easily restricted, but it can also be done if it is obtained. Guangzhou is far from Beijing, and it is not easy to call on the Central Plains, but it can attack and retreat, and the people are more enlightened and easier to succeed." Therefore, Mr. Sun Yat-sen believed that Guangzhou was a more reliable stronghold. Mr. Sun Yat-sen's arguments and analysis illustrate his strategic thinking, that is: no matter how bad the situation is, the revolutionary government must have a place to settle down, and then gradually develop, and in the process of development, the rear must also be consolidated. Later, the contradiction between Mr. Sun Yat-sen and Chen Jiongming was also related to this point. At this time, Yuan Shikai had died, and Duan Qirui, the warlord who succeeded Yuan Shikai in power, first restored the provisional constitution and the parliament under the demands of the various anti-Yuan factions. Soon after, he disagreed with Li Yuanhong on the issue of participation in the war, resulting in Zhang Xun's restoration of Puyi, thus brazenly destroying the provisional constitution and disbanding the parliament. Mr. Sun Yat-sen then led the navy to Guangdong, uniting the local forces of Guangdong, Guangxi, and Yunnan provinces, and organized a military government to protect the constitution in Guangzhou. He was elected by the National Assembly of the south as the Grand Marshal of the Army and Navy of the Republic of China. In 1918, the southern small warlords and the northern warlords gradually compromised. They initiated the reorganization of the military government and set up seven presidents. Mr. Sun Yat-sen resigned from the post of Grand Marshal and left Guangdong for Shanghai, where he began to write the National Reconstruction Program.
    In the autumn of 1920, the Guangdong Army returned to Guangdong, and Mr. Sun Yat-sen returned to Guangdong in December to reorganize the military government. The so-called Guangdong Army was preserved by Mr. Sun Yat-sen during his tenure as Grand Marshal of the military government despite the opposition of the Gui faction. At this time, Chen Jiongming served as the commander-in-chief of the Guangdong Army, the governor of Guangdong Province, and the Minister of the Army of the military government, becoming the controller of the military and political power of Guangdong. On May 5, 1921, Mr. Sun Yat-sen took office as the Extraordinary President. At this time, Chen Jiongming, on the one hand, watched the movements of the Beiyang warlords, and on the other hand, led the Guangdong Army to fight the Gui faction warlords. In less than three months, with the power of Mr. Sun Yat-sen, Chen Jiongming leveled the Gui faction, and the military government appointed Ma Junwu as the governor of Guangxi Province. At the same time, Mr. Sun Yat-sen incorporated more than 100,000 troops from all the Dian Army, Gui Army, and part of the Xiang Army within the borders of Guangdong and Guangxi, and actively prepared for the Northern Expedition; while Chen Jiongming secretly colluded with the Northern warlords, vigorously advocating his so-called federalism of provinces. At the end of July, Mr. Sun Yat-sen sent me, Hu Hanmin, Ju Zheng, and Wang Jingwei to Nanning to meet Chen Jiongming. Before my departure, Mr. Sun Yat-sen said: "You go and tell Chen Jiongming that I am determined to launch the Northern Expedition this time, and there will be no change. Although the success or failure is still unknown, it is ultimately beneficial to Chen. If it succeeds, my army will leave Guangdong, and Guangdong can save a lot of expenses; if it fails, my army will be scattered, and Chen Jiongming can compromise with the North and make arrangements." I was ordered to go to Nanning and repeatedly debated with Chen Jiongming and repeatedly persuaded him, but to no avail. Finally, I said: "You leveled the Gui faction, which just shows that the people's hearts are turning to the Kuomintang. Mr. Sun Yat-sen's Northern Expedition has a large army, which is the right time. You should promote this matter." Chen Jiongming said: "I agree with Mr. Sun Yat-sen's Northern Expedition, but the time has not yet come. Now Guangxi is just leveled. Although the Gui people govern Guangxi, it is still unstable. I think it is better to delay it a little longer." The true intention of Chen Jiongming's words was: to stabilize the situation first, stubbornly preserve it, so as to form a separatist force of his own. Therefore, I said to Chen Jiongming: "Wu Peifu is not at ease with the South. Only by following Mr. Sun Yat-sen's wishes and preparing for the Northern Expedition can Guangdong be preserved." I also repeatedly explained Mr. Sun Yat-sen's instructions to Chen Jiongming. Chen Jiongming said: "I am not opposed to the Northern Expedition, but I ask Mr. Sun Yat-sen to be cautious again and again." I knew that this was Chen Jiongming deliberately perfunctory, so I sent a telegram to Mr. Sun Yat-sen for instructions. Mr. Sun Yat-sen immediately replied that he would come to Guangxi in person. When Chen Jiongming heard this, he immediately changed his tone and said that he wanted to return to Guangdong. In October, Mr. Sun Yat-sen and Chen Jiongming met in a boat on the Xun River near Wuzhou. Chen Jiongming reluctantly agreed to Mr. Sun Yat-sen's Northern Expedition in words. Mr. Sun Yat-sen organized a general headquarters in Guilin and actively prepared for the Northern Expedition. At this time, Liao Zhongkai was responsible for financial planning, Deng Keng was responsible for organizing the guard troops, and I was responsible for formulating military plans and liaison work with various provinces. While we were actively preparing for the Northern Expedition in all aspects, Chen Jiongming and his subordinates in Guangzhou were also carrying out intense conspiracy and sabotage activities. On the evening of February 20, 1922, on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway Station in Guangzhou, assassins hired by Chen Jiongming assassinated Deng Keng. In mid-March, I went to Wuzhou and reported the situation in Guangzhou to Mr. Sun Yat-sen. Mr. Sun Yat-sen believed that Deng Keng was killed by Chen Jiongming, which was a prelude and signal to sabotage the Northern Expedition. Therefore, he decisively ordered the removal of all Chen Jiongming's duties. After Chen Jiongming was dismissed, he fled to Huizhou. For a time, the Guangdong Army swarmed back from Gui, and rumors spread. In April, Mr. Sun Yat-sen led his army to station in Shaozhou. In mid-May, Mr. Sun Yat-sen telegraphed me to go to Shaozhou. When I arrived, Mr. Sun Yat-sen said to me: "The Northern Expedition has been decided, and everything has been prepared properly. The worry is that the situation in Guangdong is unstable." I reported to Mr. Sun Yat-sen one by one the movements of Chen Jiongming's subordinates Ye Ju, Xiong Lue, Chen Jiongguang, Chen Juemin, Huang Qiang, Zhong Jingtang, Hong Zhaolin, Chen Xiaoyue, Weng Shiliang, Li Bingrong, Li Yunfu and their reactionary sentiments. Mr. Sun Yat-sen thought for a long time and said: "Chen Jiongming's dismissal was well-deserved, but the Northern Expedition is the most important thing at present. In order to stabilize the rear, military matters must still be found with Chen Jiongming." I said: "Chen Jiongming not only has military ambitions, but also has insatiable political desires. He was dismissed from three positions some time ago. Now, if he is to be reused again, he will not do it without a proper name." So I discussed with Mr. Sun Yat-sen to appoint Chen Jiongming as the Inspector of Guangdong and Guangxi, and then I went to Huizhou to contact Chen. After obtaining his consent, I telegraphed Shaozhou, and Mr. Sun Yat-sen replied and appointed Chen Jiongming as the Inspector of Guangdong and Guangxi. At the end of May, Mr. Sun Yat-sen returned to Guangzhou from Shaozhou. At this time, I succeeded Chen Jiongming as the Minister of the Army. Chen Jiongming's troops Ye Ju and others repeatedly urged the troops to pay military salaries. On June 6, I went to Zhengxian Temple on Baiyun Mountain to Ye Ju's command post to express my condolences and explain. When I arrived at Zhengxian Temple, Ye Ju, Xiong Lue, Huang Qiang, Zhong Jingtang, and Hong Zhaolin were all present. They scolded Mr. Sun Yat-sen. Seeing that these people had completely revealed their rebellious feelings, I returned and reported these situations to Mr. Sun Yat-sen and advised Mr. Sun Yat-sen to return to Shaozhou quickly. Mr. Sun Yat-sen said: "Dare he? Let's still do the Northern Expedition!" Who knew that on the night of June 16, 1922, Chen's army actually took the risk of the world and surrounded the presidential palace under Guanyin Mountain in Guangzhou. Someone personally saw Mr. Sun Yat-sen being escorted to the Yongfeng warship by Lin Zhimian and Lin Shuwei that night in a hurry. When I got this news, I went to see Mr. Sun Yat-sen on the Yongfeng warship in Huangpu. Mr. Sun Yat-sen looked calm and took out a letter from Chen Jiongming for me to read. Chen Jiongming wrote in the letter "Offending dignity, deserves to die." Mr. Sun Yat-sen smiled and said to me: "Chen Jiongming wrote such a letter to me, who can he deceive?" I asked Mr. Sun Yat-sen what to do. Mr. Sun Yat-sen said: "Organize the army and continue to do it!" On the 19th, Mr. Sun Yat-sen sailed the Yongfeng warship from Huangpu Outer River to Guangzhou. Passing through the Shaji Fort, Chen Jiongming's troops stationed at the Shaji Fort fired artillery. The Yongfeng warship returned fire, but was hit by a bullet and still limped to Baie Tan. I took a small boat to board the ship to meet Mr. Sun Yat-sen. In less than ten minutes, an Englishman boarded the ship to see him. This Englishman said a lot to Mr. Sun Yat-sen, but seeing Mr. Sun Yat-sen's stern expression, he reprimanded the Englishman. The man also bid farewell and fled. I didn't understand English, so I asked the reason afterwards. Mr. Sun Yat-sen said: "This is the British consul stationed in Shameen. He said that Shameen is a concession and Baie Tan is close to Shameen. Our warships should not sail to Shameen. I refuted him and told him that Shameen is a Chinese place, and Baie Tan is not Shameen. The President of China can be stationed anywhere in China." From this, it can be seen that Mr. Sun Yat-sen did not show any color to the imperialist elements. Mr. Sun Yat-sen persisted in the struggle on the Yongfeng warship for more than fifty days. Later, the Northern Expeditionary Army Xu Chongzhi and other troops were defeated in Shaoguan, and Mr. Sun Yat-sen returned to Shanghai to continue his revolutionary activities.
    After Mr. Sun Yat-sen returned to Shanghai, he lived in Moliai Road, now the "Sun Yat-sen Former Residence." At this time, Mr. Sun Yat-sen, with the help of the Chinese Communists and the Soviet Union, was actively reorganizing the Kuomintang. In the winter of that year, the Dian Army Yang Ximin, Jiang Xinzhi, Fan Shisheng, Yang Ruxuan, and the Gui Army Liu Zhenhuan, Shen Hongying and other troops sent troops to Shanghai to request incorporation. In order to restore the strategic stronghold, Mr. Sun Yat-sen used the power of these people to drive Chen Jiongming away. Chen could not defeat him and retreated to Dongjiang. In February 1923, Mr. Sun Yat-sen returned to Guangdong and reorganized the Grand Marshal's Headquarters. With Mr. Sun Yat-sen's permission, I opened the Grand Marshal's Headquarters Military Academy in Guangzhou in the autumn of that year. In winter, Borodin came to Guangdong and suggested that Mr. Sun Yat-sen run a military school. With the great help of the Chinese Communists, the Huangpu Military Academy began to prepare. In November, the Kuomintang reorganization declaration was issued. At that time, some right-wing elements in the Kuomintang opposed the reorganization. Mr. Sun Yat-sen was extremely annoyed and did not hesitate to take strict disciplinary measures against the extremely reactionary elements.
    In January 1924, thanks to the efforts of the Chinese Communist Party and the important assistance of the leading organs of the Communist International and the Soviet Communist Party, the Kuomintang led by Mr. Sun Yat-sen held its first national congress in Guangzhou. The congress issued a declaration, stipulated the program of the democratic revolution, and various methods for reorganizing the Kuomintang to make it revolutionary. At this time, Mr. Sun Yat-sen resolutely proposed and implemented the three major policies of revolution: uniting the Soviet Union, "taking Russia as a teacher"; uniting the Chinese Communist Party, with a large number of Communists joining the party and government organs of the Guangzhou revolutionary base to work; supporting the workers' movement and the peasants' movement, indicating that the future revolution should "stand on the position of the masses and be its guide," and "the revolutionary cause should be initiated by the masses and achieved by the masses." Mr. Sun Yat-sen reinterpreted the Three Principles of the People and clearly stated: "The three major policies are the only way to implement the Three Principles of the People." This resolute, brave, big-stride, and profound revolutionary transformation taken by Mr. Sun Yat-sen in his later years shows that he abandoned the proposition of the bourgeois republic and accepted the program of the people's democratic republic.
    Mr. Sun Yat-sen's high degree of political and ideological maturity in his later years gave him stronger revolutionary power. This is manifested in: In December 1923, American and British imperialism robbed Guangdong customs duties. Mr. Sun Yat-sen did not bow to imperialism and adopted a firm opposition attitude; in October 1924, the Guangzhou Merchant Corps rebelled, and Mr. Sun Yat-sen adopted a resolute suppression method and disarmed all the Merchant Corps. In 1924, Mr. Sun Yat-sen went north. In the sharp struggle to strive for the convening of the National Assembly and the abolition of unequal treaties, he died in Beijing on March 12, 1925. On his deathbed, Mr. Sun Yat-sen still did not forget "Peace, struggle, save China!" and earnestly exhorted his comrades: "The revolution has not yet succeeded, comrades still need to work hard!"

    On the occasion of commemorating the 90th anniversary of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's birth, I cannot help but think of the Kuomintang members who were educated by Mr. Sun Yat-sen, shared hardships with me for a long time, and are now trapped in Taiwan. I think that as long as they are loyal to Mr. Sun Yat-sen, as long as they still have patriotism, then, when they face the willful tyranny of the American invaders in Taiwan and insincerely shout the slogan of "anti-communist and anti-Russian," they will definitely feel ashamed, uneasy, and painful. However, passive shame and pain cannot bring any benefit to people. What is important is to be a brave patriot, learn from Mr. Sun Yat-sen's spirit of pursuing truth and continuous progress, and strive to make contributions in the cause of peaceful liberation of Taiwan. A message to friends in Taiwan: Read the "Declaration of the First National Congress of the Chinese Kuomintang" and the "Three Principles of the People" carefully, so that you will know what to choose.

    纪念伟大的革命先行者——孙中山先生
    程潜
    在我的生命的历程中，有过很长的一段时期，追随中山先生从事革命活动。中山先生的革命风范和声音笑貌，在我的思想上留下了深刻的记忆，它鞭策着我紧紧地跟随着人民革命的步伐前进。
    1905年，我在日本东京振武学校读书，当时中山先生已在日本组织了中国革命同盟会。由于黄兴、宋教仁的介绍，我和同学江隽等在横滨一家中国餐馆内第一次会晤了中山先生。中山先生热情地和我们谈起革命的宗旨，我当时听了中山先生的谈话，内心十分倾折，顿然燃烧起年青的革命热情。不久，我就加入了同盟会。
    1912年，中山先生辞临时大总统职之后，我在上海第二次见到他。中山先生向我说：“只要袁世凯不做皇帝，那就好办了。现在有议会，有临时约法，总统是选举出来的，不选他，他就无所作为了。”谁知，当袁世凯发现国民党在议会
  “选举”得胜，“始悟疏忽选举之失策”的时候，就嗾使赵秉钧组织凶手，于1913年春天在上海将热衷于组织政党内阁的宋教仁狙杀了。宋案发生后，粤湘赣鄂四省联盟，掀起了讨袁军，不数月即告失败。
    讨袁军失败之后，中山先生重赴日本，在东京将国民党撤销，改组为中华革命党，并亲自拟订中华革命党总章。大家知道，辛亥革命之后，同盟会曾经改组为国民党，一时官僚政客大量涌入，良莠不齐，鱼龙混杂，使国民党完全丧失了革命的战斗力。中山先生有鉴于此，在“中华革命党宣言”内就提出“正本清源”的办法：（一）、迸斥官僚；（二）、淘汰伪革命党，以收完全统一之效。中山先生为了巩固党和提高党的战斗力，提出这个办法和一些相应的入党手续仪式，在当时的情况下，应该说是用心良苦，也是完全正确的。但这个做法，却被一些革命党人所误解，因此不愿加入中华革命党，这样就被一些阴谋分子所乘，在同志之间制造龃龉。因此，黄兴等人后来没有加入中华革命党。（我当时也没有加入中华革命党，直到1919年才加入。）为这些事，中山先生还写了一封言词恳切的信给黄兴，鼓励他继续为革命工作。后来黄兴病逝，中山先生十分悲切，他对我说：“黄克强是最有力量、最有才具、最勇敢的革命党人，是我的一个好帮手。”在祭奠黄兴时，除了公祭的祭文以外，中山先生还亲自写了沉痛的祭文。中山先生团结同志的宽宏气度，热爱同志的真情实感，于此可见一斑。
    1916年，在上海环龙路六十三号，中山先生又和我们谈起革命的战略和策略问题。中山先生说：“革命之成败，主要的是靠主义，就是要有政治纲领；和主义相联的就是靠人民拥护，至于要倡大义于天下，就是靠得战略要点，设立政府，明目张胆地揭举旗帜。”中山先生是主张先占领城市作为据点的，他向我们分析几个主要城市的情况，他说：“最好首都暴动，取得政权，号召全国，可以一举成功，但北京暴虐统治过久，风气不开，反动军警严密，不容易得手。武昌是辛亥首义时的发祥地，但后来军阀盘踞北京，旋即失效。南京地处东南，易受限制，但得之亦有可为。广州距北京远，不易号召中原，但进可以攻，退可以守，且民智开通，比较容易得手。”因此，中山先生认为广州是比较可资凭借的据点。中山先生这些论断和分析，说明了他的一个战略思想，即：无论在什么恶劣的情况下，革命政府总要有一个安身立命的地方，然后徐图发展，在发展中也要将后方巩固起来。后来中山先生和陈炯明的矛盾，也是和这一点有关的。这时袁世凯已死，继袁世凯掌握政权的军阀段祺瑞，先是在反袁各派要求之下恢复约法和国会，不久，又因参战问题与黎元洪不和，造成张勋拥溥仪复辟之举，由是悍然毁弃约法，解散国会。中山先生于是率海军到广东，联合广东、广西、云南各省的地方势力，在广州组织护法军政府，由南下的国会会议选举为中华民国军政府海陆军大元帅。1918年，南方的小军阀和北方的军阀逐渐妥协，他们发起改组军政府，设七总裁，中山先生辞了大元帅职务，于是离开广东到上海，开始写建国方略。
    1920年秋，粤军回粤，中山先生12月又回广东，重整军政府。所谓粤军，就是中山先生在军政府大元帅时期不顾桂系的反对而保持下来的。这时陈炯明任粤军总司令，广东省长和军政府的陆军部长，成为广东军政大权的控制者。1921年5月5日，中山先生就任非常大总统。这时陈炯明一方面眼睛望着北洋军阀的动态，一方面率领粤军去打桂系军阀。不到三个月，借中山先生的威力，陈炯明削平了桂系，军政府就任命马君武为广西省长。与此同时，中山先生收编了两广境内的全部滇军、桂军和湘军的一部共十余万人，积极准备北伐；而陈炯明却暗中勾结北方军阀，大倡其所谓联省自治。7月底，中山先生派我和胡汉民、居正、汪精卫到南宁去会陈炯明，中山先生在我行前说：“你去告诉陈炯明，我这回决意北伐，定无更改，成败虽未可知，但总归是于陈有利的。成功了，我的军队离开广东，广东就可省下许多开支；失败了，我的军队被打散，陈炯明就自可和北方妥协善后。”我衔命到南宁，和陈炯明反复辩论，再三劝告，不得要领，最后我说：“你削平，桂系正好说明人心归向国民党。中山先生北伐，军队甚多，正是时机，你应该促成这件事情。”陈炯明说：“我赞成中山先生北伐，但时机未到。现在广西刚平，虽然以桂人治桂，但仍是不稳，我看还是稍迟一些为好。”陈炯明这些话的真实意图是：先稳定局面，负隅保守，以便形成一己割据的势力。因此我对陈炯明说：“吴佩孚并不放心南方，只有从中山先生意旨，筹备北伐，广东才能保住。”我并且把中山先生的嘱语反复向陈炯明说明。陈炯明却说：“我不反对北伐，但求中山先生再三审慎。”我知道这是陈炯明故意支吾，所以打电报向中山先生请示，中山先生立刻回电说要亲自来广西。陈炯明听见这事，立刻改变口气，表示要回广东。10月间，中山先生和陈炯明在梧州附近浔江舟中晤面，陈炯明才在口头上勉强同意中山先生北伐。中山先生在桂林组织大本营，积极筹备北伐，这时，廖仲恺负责财政方面的筹划，邓铿负责组织警卫军队，我负责制订军事计划和各省的联络接洽工作。当我们正在从各方面积极准备北伐的时候，广州的陈炯明和他的部下也正在进行紧张的阴谋破坏活动。1922年2月20日晚上，在广州的广九车站上，陈炯明雇用来的凶手，将邓铿刺杀了。3月中旬，我到梧州，向中山先生报告了广州情况。中山先生认为邓铿是陈炯明所害，这是破坏北伐的先声和信号，因此断然下令，免去了陈炯明的所有职务。陈炯明免职后避往惠州，一时粤军自桂蜂涌而归，谣诼纷传。4月，中山先生率军出驻韶州。5月中旬，中山先生电我赴韶，至则中山先生对我说：“北伐已定，一切都已准备定妥，忧虑的就是广东情况不安。”我将陈炯明部下叶举、熊略、陈炯光、陈觉民、黄强、锺景棠、洪兆麟、陈小岳、翁式亮、李炳荣、李云复等部队的移动情况和他们流露出来的反动情绪一一向中山先生报告，中山先生思索了许久，说：“前此陈炯明的免职是罪有应得的，但目前北伐要紧，为了稳定后方，军事问题还是要找陈炯明。”我说：“陈炯明不但在军事上有野心，在政治上也是欲壑难填，前些时免了他三个职务，现在要再起用他，如果没有适当名义，他是不会干的。”于是我和中山先生商定委陈炯明为两广巡阅使，然后我才赴惠和陈接洽。得到他的同意，我电报韶州，中山先生就复电委陈炯明为两广巡阅使。5月底，中山先生从韶州回到了广州。这时，我继陈炯明为陆军部长，陈炯明的部队叶举等迭向部催索军饷，我于6月6日到白云山郑仙祠叶举指挥部去慰问解释。当我到郑仙祠时，叶举、熊略、黄强、锺景棠、洪兆麟都在座，他们大骂中山先生。我看这些人反情毕露，归来后就将这些情况向中山先生汇报，并劝中山先生迅速返韶。中山先生说：“他敢吗？我们还是搞北伐的事罢！”谁知，1922年6月16日夜间，陈家军竟冒天下之大不韪，包围广州观音山下的总统府。有人亲见中山先生当晚于事起仓促中由林直勉、林树巍护送到永丰军舰上。我得到这个消息，就去黄埔永丰舰上见中山先生，中山先生神色自若，当时拿出一封陈炯明的信给我看。陈炯明在信中有“冒犯尊严，罪该万死”等语，中山先生笑着对我说：“陈炯明还写这样的信给我，他能骗谁？”我问中山先生怎么办，中山先生说：“组织军队，继续干！”19日，中山先生乘永丰舰自黄埔外河驶向广州，途经沙基炮台，驻沙基炮台的陈炯明部队发炮轰击，永丰舰还击，但被中一弹，仍然负创开到了白鹅潭。我当时乘小艇登舰晤中山先生，不到十分钟，就有一个英国人登舰求见。这个英国人向中山先生说了好些话，但见中山先生声色俱厉，申斥了那英国人一顿，这人也就告辞，抱头鼠窜而去。我不懂英文，事后询问原由，中山先生说：“这就是英国驻沙面的领事，他说沙面是租界，白鹅潭靠近沙面，我们的军舰，不应该开到沙面。我反驳了他一顿，告诉他沙面是中国的地方，白鹅潭又不是沙面，中国的大总统，中国的任何地方我都可以驻得的。”由此可见，中山先生对帝国主义分子是丝毫不假颜色的。中山先生在永丰舰上坚持斗争五十多天，后来北伐军许崇智等部回师在韶关战败，中山先生才回上海继续他的革命活动。
    中山先生回上海后，住在莫利爱路现在的“中山故居”。中山先生这时即在中国共产党人和苏联的帮助之下，积极着手改组国民党。这年冬天，滇军杨希闵、蒋信之、范石生、杨如轩，桂军刘震寰、沈鸿英等部派兵来上海请求收编，中山先生为了恢复战略据点，遂假这些人的力量逐陈炯明，陈不敌，退守东江。1923年2月，中山先生回粤，重组大元帅大本营。我得到中山先生的允许，这年秋天在广州开办大本营讲武堂。冬天，鲍罗廷来粤，建议中山先生办军事学校，得到中国共产党人的大力帮助，黄埔军官学校才开始筹备。11月间，发表国民党改组宣言。当时国民党内一部分右派分子反对改组，中山先生异常懊恼，对极端反动分子不惜采取了严厉的纪律措施。
    1924年1月，由于中国共产党的努力，由于共产国际领导机关和苏联共产党的重要援助，中山先生领导的国民党在广州召开了第一次全国代表大会。这次大会发表了宣言，规定了民主革命的纲领和改组国民党使之革命化的各项办法。中山先生在这时坚决提出并实行革命的三大政策：联合苏联，“以俄为师”；联合中国共产党，共产党人大批加入广州革命根据地的党政军机关工作；扶助工人运动和农民运动，表示今后的革命要“立于民众之地位而为之向导”、“革命事业由民众发之，亦由民众成之”。中山先生重新解释了三民主义，并且明确地说：“三大政策是实行三民主义的唯一方法。”中山先生晚年所采取的这种坚决的、勇敢的、大踏步的、深刻的革命转变，表明他放弃了资产阶级共和国的主张，接受了人民的民主共和国的纲领。
    中山先生晚年这种政治上和思想上的高度成熟，赋予他以更坚强的革命力量。这表现在：1923年12月，美英帝国主义劫夺广东关税，中山先生不向帝国主义低头，采取了坚决反对的态度；1924年10月，广州商团叛变，中山先生采取了坚决镇压的办法，把商团武装全部缴械了。1924年中山先生北上，在为争取召开国民会议和废除不平等条约的尖锐斗争中，于1925年3月12日在北京逝世。中山先生在弥留之际，仍然念念不忘“和平，奋斗，救中国！”并殷殷嘱咐同志们：“革命尚未成功，同志仍须努力！”

    在纪念中山先生诞辰九十周年的日子里，我不能不想起由中山先生教育出来的、和我长期共过患难的、现在身陷台湾的国民党人。我想，只要他们忠实于中山先生，只要他们还具备爱国心，那么，当他们面对着美国侵略者在台湾的恣意横行，口不应心地喊着“反共抗俄”的口号的时候，他们就一定会是羞愧不安和痛苦难堪的。但是，消极的羞愧和痛苦，不能给人们带来任何好处。要紧的是，做一个勇敢的爱国者，学习中山先生追求真理、不断进步的精神，在和平解放台湾的事业中争取立功。寄语台湾的朋友们：过细温读一下“中国国民党第一次全国代表大会宣言”和“三民主义”，这样就会自知有所抉择的。
