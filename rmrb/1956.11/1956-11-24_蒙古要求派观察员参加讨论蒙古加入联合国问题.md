Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, November 23rd: A spokesman for the Mongolian Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated on the 22nd that the United Nations' refusal to allow Mongolia to send observers to participate in discussions on Mongolia's admission to the United Nations completely ignores the demands of the Mongolian people.

The spokesman told reporters from the Mongolian "Truth" newspaper that Mongolia had twice telegraphed the United Nations, on September 14th and October 30th of this year, requesting that the current General Assembly allow Mongolia to send observers to participate when discussing the issue of admitting Mongolia to the United Nations. However, United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskjöld replied on November 14th that there was no explicit provision allowing non-member states to send observers to participate in the Assembly.

The spokesman said that Mongolian Foreign Minister Aji'erbihi had replied to Hammarskjöld, reminding him that Mongolia had sent representatives when the Security Council discussed Mongolia's admission to the United Nations in 1946. The spokesman said that the United Nations should resolve this wish of Mongolia reasonably.

    蒙古要求派观察员参加讨论蒙古加入联合国问题
    新华社乌兰巴托23日电　蒙古外交部发言人22日说，联合国不让蒙古派观察员参加讨论蒙古加入联合国的问题，完全抹杀了蒙古人民的要求。
    外交部发言人对蒙古“真理报”的记者说，蒙古曾经在今年9月14日和10月30日两次打电报给联合国，要求本届联大在讨论接纳蒙古加入联合国问题时，让蒙古派观察员参加。但是联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德11月14日复电说，没有明文规定非会员国可以派观察员参加大会。
    这位发言人说，蒙古外交部长阿吉尔毕希复电哈马舍尔德，提醒他注意在1946年安全理事会讨论蒙古加入联合国的问题时，蒙古就曾经派出过代表。发言人说，蒙古的这个愿望，联合国应该合理地解决。
