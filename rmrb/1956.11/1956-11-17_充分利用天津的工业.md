Fully Utilize Tianjin's Industry
Cui Ronghan, Head of the State-Owned Industry Department of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party

Tianjin is a large, comprehensive industrial city with a considerable industrial base, a certain level of technical expertise, and rich production experience among workers and technicians. Its transportation is convenient, and it has a foundation for urban construction and urban services. If these conditions are fully utilized, they will undoubtedly play a significant role. At the same time, based on the needs of the country, expanding and renovating certain factories on the existing foundation can save cadres, basic construction investment, and easily obtain cooperative convenience and local support in terms of manpower and materials, without significantly increasing the costs of urban construction and service industries. Generally speaking, it can achieve the effect of small investment, large profits, and quick returns.

From 1949 to 1955, the total profit of all sectors of the national economy in Tianjin was 2.3 billion yuan, equivalent to more than two and a half times the total value of fixed assets. Tens of thousands of management cadres, technicians, and skilled workers were transferred to other areas. Many "shabby" factories that were originally looked down upon have exerted tremendous power because they have been utilized more fully. For example, the Tianjin Bicycle Factory's new investment from 1949 to 1955 was only equivalent to 42% of its existing total fixed assets, but its output value increased by twenty-three times. The Tianjin No. 1 Printing and Dyeing Factory's output value in 1955 increased seventeen times compared to 1949, and it earned a total profit of 8.12 million yuan in seven years, equivalent to 3.06 times its total assets. The new investment in the Tianjin Steel Plant during the seven years was also only equivalent to 40% of its existing total fixed assets, but its output value increased twelvefold; the profits turned over in the six years from 1950 to 1955 could build six factories of the same scale. If another 14 million yuan were invested, the output of steel ingots could be increased from the current 120,000 tons to 580,000 tons. Many scattered and backward local state-owned machine repair factories have also been reorganized and transformed, and are now large-scale, specialized factories with around a thousand workers capable of producing precision equipment. It is clear that such utilization is beneficial to the country.

However, Tianjin's industrial strength is still not utilized enough. Before 1953, the speed of industrial development was very fast. However, in 1954 and 1955, due to insufficient raw materials and tasks, industrial production encountered serious difficulties, and the phenomenon of suspension and semi-suspension of work was quite serious. Some factories that had the conditions for expansion and renovation did not make the necessary investments. In some industries, the development of state-owned industry and local industry lacked comprehensive planning, which limited or idled Tianjin's production capacity. Even some products that had been successfully trial-produced in Tianjin and could be produced in Tianjin were transferred to other places for production. The equipment utilization rate of many factories is still very low, and the imbalance of equipment has not been greatly improved. There is still enormous potential in production that needs to be further exploited.

We believe that the reasons for this situation, in addition to some objective difficulties, are mainly due to the lack of a clear policy of fully utilizing coastal industrial cities since our country began planned economic construction. There was more consideration of passively maintaining the status quo and less consideration of actively playing a full role. In addition, there are still many shortcomings and errors in our work. This has adversely affected the development of Tianjin's industry.

Now, the policy of fully utilizing coastal industrial cities is clear. However, there are still some problems in the specific implementation. These are mainly: when conducting planning, the central state-owned industry and local industry are planned separately, without unified planning by industry and regardless of economic type. In local industry, on the one hand, some plans do not proceed from reality, disregard the actual needs of the country and their own strength, and blindly pursue "large scale," requiring excessive investment. On the other hand, they are unwilling to organize the production of some small-output, scattered, diverse products that are necessary for the national economy and people's livelihood, and even some small factories with special technologies needed for national construction are ignored. Some people are only willing to "go it alone" and are unwilling to cooperate; they are only willing to produce standard equipment and are unwilling to repair and produce non-standard equipment, so they cannot meet the needs of cooperation and repair. We believe that neglecting full utilization and blindly developing regardless of conditions are both wrong. The correct policy should be: under the unified national plan, fully utilize and rationally develop. Full utilization and rational development are interconnected and inseparable. Without rational development, merely maintaining the status quo cannot achieve full utilization. At the same time, Tianjin's industrial products, except for a few that are produced and sold locally, need to be balanced by the state and incorporated into the unified national plan to avoid blindness.

According to this policy, we believe that Tianjin's future development direction should be: supporting national key construction projects; producing general production equipment specified by the state; producing daily necessities for the people, especially farmers; processing and cooperating for state-owned factories; providing repair services for general industries; and developing relatively advanced products that require a certain level of technical expertise. Because Tianjin is close to the Bohai Sea, it can develop marine chemical industry, marine food processing industry, and export industry. According to this development direction, necessary investments must be made in the future. General investment directions can be: renovation, expansion, or new construction projects with low investment, high profits, quick returns, and available markets and raw materials; balancing equipment; repairing factory buildings; measures needed to improve quality and trial-produce new products; and investment in production reorganization and technological transformation.

In specific work, the main tasks are:

First, under the overall arrangement of the central government, conduct comprehensive planning industry by industry and complete the production reorganization of joint state-private enterprises under the guidance of the comprehensive plan. In the planning, first determine the production direction of the industry and factory, and then determine the requirements for expansion, renovation, and technological transformation according to the production direction. Then, regardless of economic type, carry out production reorganization according to the principles of using advanced to lead backward, using large to lead small, fully utilizing existing equipment, properly arranging cooperative relationships, paying attention to maintaining and developing products with excellent traditions, and preventing blind concentration and reduction of products.

Second, gradually carry out technological transformation, vigorously cultivate technical personnel, and improve the technical level of employees. We plan to combine production reorganization with renovation and expansion, and carry out technological transformation in a planned and step-by-step manner. We plan to invest a certain amount of capital according to existing conditions, balance some equipment, add some new equipment and key equipment; gradually renovate and replace some excessively old machines; enrich and improve design, testing, and inspection work institutions, and improve the production conditions of factories.

Actively cultivating technical talents and improving the technical level of workers are of extremely important significance for supporting national construction and fully utilizing Tianjin's industry. To this end, we must make rational use of existing technical forces, actively organize technical learning for workers and technicians, effectively run Tianjin Industrial School, and fully utilize the technical personnel among the bourgeoisie. In addition, we hope that the central government will give us the necessary consideration in the allocation of engineering graduates from universities.

Third, in order to ensure the smooth progress of the above tasks, the current national administrative system should be improved. Comrade Zhou Enlai pointed out in his report to the Eighth National Congress of the Party that the principle of changing the national administrative system is of great significance for strengthening the leadership of the central government and giving play to the initiative of local governments, and it is also conducive to the unified arrangement of the country and giving play to the production potential of existing enterprises.

    充分利用天津的工业
    中共天津市委国营工业部长　崔荣汉
    天津市是一个较大的综合性的工业城市，有相当的工业基础，有一定的技术力量，工人和技术人员的生产经验很丰富，交通便利，城市建设和城市服务事业也有基础。这些条件如果被充分利用起来，一定会发挥相当大的作用。同时，根据国家的需要，在现有基础上对某些工厂进行扩建和改建，也可以节省干部，节省基本建设投资，容易取得协作的便利和人力物力的就地支援，不需增加很多城市建设和服务事业的费用。一般来说，可以收到投资小、盈利大、收回快的效果。
    从1949年到1955年，天津市国民经济各部门利润总额为二十三亿元，相当于固定资产总值的二倍半以上。向外输送管理干部、技术人员和技术工人上万人。有不少原来被人们看不起的“破烂”工厂，因为得到比较充分的利用，发挥了极大的力量。例如天津自行车厂，从1949年到1955年，新增的投资不过相当于它的现有固定资产总值的42％，但产值却增加了二十三倍。天津市第一印染厂，1955年比1949年产值提高了十七倍，七年共得利润八百一十二万元，相当于全部资产的三点零六倍。天津钢厂，七年中新增加的投资，也不过相当于它的现有固定资产总值的40％，但产值却增长了十二倍；从1950年到1955年六年上缴的利润就可以建设同样规模的六个工厂；如果再投资一千四百余万元，钢锭的产量就可以由现在的十二万吨，提高到五十八万吨。还有许多分散落后的地方国营机器修配厂，经过改组改造，现在也已成为专业化的能生产精密设备的千人上下的大工厂了。很明显，这样的利用，对国家是有利的。
    但是，天津的工业的力量还是利用得不够的。1953年以前，工业发展的速度很快。但是，在1954年和1955年，由于原料和任务不足，工业生产上遇到了严重的困难，停工半停工的现象相当严重。有些有条件扩建、改建的工厂也没有作必要的投资；有些行业，由于国营工业和各地地方工业的发展缺乏全面的安排，使天津的生产能力受到限制或被闲置起来。甚至有些已经在天津试制成功可以在天津生产的产品，也转移到外地去生产。许多工厂的设备利用率还很低，设备不平衡的状况没有很大改进，生产上还有巨大潜力需要进一步地发挥。
    造成这种情况的原因，我们认为除了一些客观困难而外，主要原因之一是自从我国开始有计划的经济建设以后，对充分利用沿海工业城市的方针不够明确。从消极地维持现状的方面考虑得多，从积极地充分发挥作用的方面考虑得少。加之工作上也还有不少的缺点和错误。这就使天津工业的发展受到了不利的影响。
    现在，充分利用沿海工业城市的方针是明确了。但是，在具体执行上还有些问题，这主要是：在进行规划时，中央国营工业和地方工业分别进行，而没有按行业的、不分经济类型的统一规划。在地方工业中，一方面有些规划不从实际出发，不顾国家的实际需要和本身的力量，盲目追求“大规模”，要求过多的投资。另一方面对一些产值小的、零星多样而又为国计民生所必需的产品却不愿意组织生产，连一些有特殊技术的为国家建设所需要的小工厂也被忽略了。还有些人只愿意“单干”，不愿意协作；只愿意生产标准设备，不愿意修配和生产非标准设备，以致不能满足协作和修理的需要。我们认为忽视充分利用和不顾条件的盲目发展都是不对的。正确的方针应当是：在国家统一计划之下，充分利用和合理发展。充分利用和合理发展是互相关连不可分割的。如果没有合理的发展，只是维持现状，就不能做到充分利用。同时，天津的工业产品除少数就地生产就地销售的而外，都需要由国家加以平衡，纳入国家的统一规划，以免发生盲目性。
    根据这个方针，我们认为天津今后发展的方向应该是：支援国家重点建设；生产国家规定的一般生产设备；生产人民群众特别是农民的生活必需品；为国营工厂加工和协作；为一般工业作修配；发展需要一定技术水平的比较高级的产品。因为天津临近渤海，可以发展海洋化学工业，海产食品加工工业和出口工业。按照这个发展方向，今后须作必要的投资。一般的投资方向可以是：投资少、利润大、收回快又有市场和原料的改建、扩建或新建；平衡设备；修理厂房；提高质量和试制新产品所需的措施费；生产改组和技术改造的投资。
    在具体工作上，主要是：
    首先要在中央的统筹安排下，逐行逐业地进行全面规划，并且在全面规划的指导下，完成对公私合营企业的生产改组工作。在规划中，首先确定行业和工厂的生产方向，并根据生产方向确定扩建、改建和技术改造的要求。然后不分经济类型，按照以先进带落后，以大带小，充分利用原有设备，妥善安排协作关系，注意保持和发展具有优良传统的产品，防止盲目集中和减少产品等原则，进行生产改组。
    第二、逐步进行技术改造，大力培养技术人员和提高职工的技术水平。我们准备与生产改组和改建、扩建相结合，有计划、有步骤地进行技术改造。准备根据现有的条件，下一定的本钱，平衡一些设备，增添一些新的设备和关键性的设备；逐步改装和替换一些过于陈旧的机器；充实和健全设计、化验、检验工作机构，以及改善工厂的生产条件。
    积极地培养技术人才和提高工人的技术水平，对支援国家建设和充分利用天津工业有极其重要的意义。为此，我们要合理使用现有的技术力量，积极组织工人和技术人员的技术学习，切实办好天津工业学校，并且把资产阶级中的技术人员充分使用起来。另外，希望中央在大学工科毕业生的分配上给我们以必要的照顾。
    第三、为了保证上述任务的顺利进行，应该改善现行的国家行政体制。周恩来同志在党的第八次全国代表大会上的报告中指出改变国家行政体制的原则，对加强中央的领导和发挥地方的积极性有重大意义，也有利于国家的统一安排和发挥现有企业的生产潜力。
