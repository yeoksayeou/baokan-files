Xinhua News Agency, Linxia, November 19th. The first session of the First People's Congress of the Linxia Hui Autonomous Prefecture of Gansu Province was held from the 13th to the 19th. The meeting focused on the establishment of the Linxia Hui Autonomous Prefecture, discussed and reviewed the work in the Linxia area over the past seven years, elected the members of the People's Committee of the Linxia Hui Autonomous Prefecture, and announced the official establishment of the Linxia Hui Autonomous Prefecture.

There were 312 delegates attending the congress, including representatives from seven ethnic groups in the prefecture: Hui, Han, Dongxiang, Bao'an, Salar, Tu, and Tibetan. The meeting elected Shen Xiaxi (Hui) as the governor of the Linxia Hui Autonomous Prefecture, Zhang Zhisheng (Han), Ma Yanliang (Hui), Jia Shude (Han), and Ma Qishan (Dongxiang) as deputy governors, and Wang Ruigang (Hui), Wang Zhe (Han), Ma Ruqi (Bao'an), and 28 others as members of the Autonomous Prefecture People's Committee by secret ballot. The meeting also elected Mu Debiao (Dongxiang) as the president of the Intermediate People's Court of the Linxia Hui Autonomous Prefecture. When the election results were announced, the audience burst into thunderous applause, and dozens of Young Pioneers from various ethnic groups presented bouquets of flowers to all the elected officials.

The meeting approved the work report on the Linxia Special District over the past seven years and the resolution on future tasks, the draft organizational regulations for the People's Congresses and People's Committees at all levels in the Linxia Hui Autonomous Prefecture, and the report on the examination of proposals. In addition, a telegram of tribute to Chairman Mao of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China was also adopted.

During the meeting, Gan Chunlei, Director of the General Office of the Nationalities Affairs Commission of the People's Republic of China, and Chen Chengyi, Deputy Governor of Gansu Province, attended the meeting. Ma Shaowen, Deputy Director of the Nationalities Affairs Commission of Gansu Province, and Meng Quanlu, Deputy Director of the Nationalities Affairs Commission of Qinghai Province, attended the meeting to offer their congratulations. All autonomous prefectures and autonomous counties of minority nationalities within Gansu Province sent people or letters to congratulate the establishment of the Linxia Hui Autonomous Prefecture.

The congress also received congratulatory telegrams and banners from the Nationalities Committee of the National People's Congress, the Islamic Association of China, and the China Hui Nationality Culture Advancement Association.

The meeting fully promoted democracy, and was filled with a democratic and united atmosphere from beginning to end. The congress and group discussions were extremely enthusiastic. The meeting spent most of its time listening to and discussing the work report of the past seven years. The delegates expressed satisfaction with the achievements made in various construction projects over the past seven years, and in the spirit of knowing everything and saying everything, put forward sincere criticisms and many valuable opinions. When they talked about ethnic relations in Linxia, they used specific examples from their own counties, townships, and personal experiences to illustrate that since liberation, especially after agricultural cooperation, new relationships of unity, mutual assistance, and fraternity have been firmly established among all ethnic groups. However, the ideas of Han chauvinism and local nationalism are still manifested to varying degrees in various works, and need to be constantly overcome in the future. Many delegates criticized the fact that this year, in some mountainous areas, high-yield crops were blindly promoted and the area of multiple cropping was increased without considering the specific conditions, resulting in reduced production. They also sharply criticized the bureaucratic style of the Dongxiang Autonomous County, where the drought in Qiutian lasted for more than sixty days, but the local leading organs did not pay attention to it, resulting in reduced production in Qiutian. Representatives also put forward many constructive opinions on the development of culture, education, and health undertakings for minority nationalities.

    甘肃省临夏回族自治州成立
    新华社临夏19日电　甘肃省临夏回族自治州第一届人民代表大会第一次会议在13日到19日举行。会议以成立临夏回族自治州为中心议题，讨论和检查了临夏地区七年来的工作，选出了临夏回族自治州人民委员会组成人员，宣布临夏回族自治州正式成立。
    参加大会的代表有三百一十二人，包括全州回、汉、东乡、保安、撒拉、土、藏等七个民族。会议以无记名投票方式选出沈遐熙（回族）为临夏回族自治州州长、张质生（汉族）、马彦良（回族）、贾树德（汉族）、马岐山（东乡族）为副州长，王瑞刚（回族）、王哲（汉族）、马如麒（保安族）等二十八人为自治州人民委员会委员。会议还选出了穆德彪（东乡族）为临夏回族自治州中级人民法院院长。当选举结果宣布时，全场响起了暴风雨般的掌声，几十名各民族少先队员，把一束束鲜花献给了当选的全体人员。
    会议通过了关于临夏专区七年来的工作报告和今后任务的决议，通过了临夏回族自治州各级人民代表大会和各级人民委员会组织条例（草案），通过了提案审查报告。此外，还通过了向中国共产党中央委员会毛主席致敬电文。
    会议期间，中华人民共和国民族事务委员会办公厅主任甘春雷、甘肃省副省长陈成义出席了会议。甘肃省民族事务委员会副主任马绍文、青海省民族事务委员会副主任孟全禄都到会祝贺。甘肃省境内的各少数民族自治州和自治县都派人或写信祝贺临夏回族自治州的成立。
    大会还收到全国人民代表大会民族委员会、中国伊斯兰教协会、中国回民文化协进会的贺电和贺幛等。
    会议充分发扬民主，自始至终充满民主和团结的气氛，大会和小组讨论极为热烈。会议以大部分时间听取和讨论七年来的工作报告。代表们对七年来所取得的各项建设成就表示满意，并本着知无不言、言无不尽的精神，提出了诚恳的批评和很多宝贵的意见。他们谈到临夏民族关系时，都以本县、本乡、本人的具体事例说明解放后特别是农业合作化以后，各民族之间已经巩固地建立起团结、互助、友爱的新关系，但大民族主义和地方民族主义的思想还在各种工作中不同程度地有所表现，需要今后不断加以克服。很多代表对今年在有些山区不根据具体条件，盲目推广高产作物和增大复种面积而造成减产的事实提出了批评；对东乡族自治县秋田发生旱象六十多天，而未引起当地领导机关重视，致使秋田减产的官僚主义作风，也进行了尖锐的批评。对发展少数民族的文化教育和卫生事业方面，代表们也提出了很多建设性的意见。
