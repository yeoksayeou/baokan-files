    Lessons from the Excavation of the Xichagou Ancient Tomb Complex
    Sun Shoudao

    Xichagou is located northwest of Jiangjia Street, Zhuncun Village, Leshan Township, Xifeng County, Liaoning. It was there that China first discovered an ancient tomb complex belonging to the Chinese Siberian culture. Based on the unearthed artifacts, the age of this group of tombs is estimated to be equivalent to the Western Han Dynasty, and no later than the early Eastern Han Dynasty. The unearthed cultural relics include two different cultural systems, namely Han culture and Scythian culture (Central Asian bronze culture). The location of the tomb complex is precisely at the northern border of the Han Dynasty's Liaodong Commandery, where it had the most frequent contact with foreign tribes. Therefore, the excavation of this group of ancient tombs is of great significance for studying the cultural exchange between ancient ethnic groups.

    It is extremely regrettable that this ancient tomb site was subjected to shocking destruction before scientific excavation. A large number of tombs were dug up and destroyed, and a large number of cultural relics were scattered everywhere after being unearthed, causing irreparable losses.

    The course of events is as follows:

    Before liberation, local villagers discovered that these ancient tombs contained gold, jade, and jewelry. After liberation, some individuals secretly carried out excavations. In the spring of 1955, some local villagers found out about this, and it happened to be during the agricultural slack season, so they all went up the mountain to dig randomly. At that time, the Xifeng County People's Committee, knowing this situation, took measures to stop it on the one hand and reported it to the Provincial Bureau of Culture on the other, and sent the cultural relics dug up by the villagers for identification. Later, the county heard that the Provincial Bureau of Culture believed that these cultural relics were not very ancient and had no "preservation value," so it gradually stopped preventing the random digging. As a result, the villagers went up the mountain to dig randomly again, and the scale suddenly increased, with the number of people increasing to several hundred every day. Even some villagers from fifty or sixty miles around came to excavate, carrying luggage and dry food; they even lit candles at night to dig, so that the candles of nearby cooperatives were temporarily sold out. This phenomenon continued until the winter of last year, with the autumn reaching the largest scale. The ancient tombs were dug up with soil layers of gray and yellow mixed together, and hundreds of randomly dug pits were connected up and down, densely packed, like bomb craters. The pits were of different sizes, deep enough to reach over the shoulders, and shallow enough to reach the knees. According to local people, the cultural relics unearthed by random digging, including jade and colored glaze ornaments alone, could fill several large baskets, and the amount of ironware and bronzeware sold as scrap copper and iron was more than several hundred catties. Among them, almost every household had one or two swords unearthed.

    Virtually all the unearthed pottery, such as pots, jars, basins, and bowls, were discarded and broken on the spot. All the gold products, such as gold cups, gold silk buttons, gold silk for threading beads, and gold flakes, were either sold for more than ten yuan per mace (a unit of weight), or kept for personal use and modification. All the bronze and iron containers, weapons, tools, and horse gear were sold to copper merchants or cooperative purchasing stations. Because some cooperatives only accepted copper and not iron, some people knocked off the various copper handles from the iron swords, which accounted for a large number, and sold them. All the colored glaze, agate, and various jade ornaments were mostly kept privately, given as gifts, or worn by themselves. All small bronzes, such as "Tianxia Daming" mirrors, nebula mirrors, perforated animal pattern decorative panels, bronze horse gear, large and small bronze buckles, various bronze arrowheads, as well as some weapons, iron tools, jade articles, etc., were scattered in various townships and regions, and many were of unknown whereabouts.

    In this way, the villagers dug up a large number of intact surfaces and destroyed the tombs simply to dig for treasures and gold, so the locations where the cultural relics were unearthed became unclear. This destructive excavation behavior was not completely stopped until May of this year, when Comrade Li Boliang of the Xifeng County State-owned Livestock Farm reported it to the Northeast Museum. After receiving the report, the Northeast Museum contacted the Provincial Bureau of Culture and sent a work team to clean up the site. Now, the cleanup work has ended on September 7. More than 5,300 cultural relics have been recovered from the villagers.

    The large-scale random digging of ancient tombs by the peasant masses has caused irreparable losses to archaeological work. In terms of tombs, the area of ​​the ground that was dug up and destroyed accounted for about 15,000 square meters, which is exactly equal to the area originally occupied by the entire tomb complex. At least 95% of the tombs were destroyed, of which at least 80% were dug up and no longer exist. The loss of the cultural relics themselves has been described above. All of this has greatly damaged the archaeological value of this group of ancient tombs.

    The archaeological value of this group of ancient tombs lies in the fact that the bronzes unearthed are not only closely related to the bronzes unearthed in the Great Wall area of ​​Inner Mongolia, but also have similarities with the bronzes of the Scythian-Siberian culture unearthed in the Soviet Union. Comparing these bronzes and some iron weapons with the bronze and iron weapons of the Central Plains of China, we can see the mutual influence. The pottery, pottery spinning wheels, and microliths with primitive characteristics unearthed in several tombs are related to the research of Neolithic and microlithic cultures in China. At the same time, these tomb complexes are also of great value for studying the culture of the Xiongnu, Wuhuan, or Xianbei people. Now that the tombs have been randomly dug up, a large number of cultural relics have been lost, and the locations where the existing cultural relics were unearthed cannot be determined, which has created great difficulties in studying these issues.

    Although this unfortunate event has been over for more than half a year, people still have to ask, what are the reasons for this unfortunate event?

    On the surface, it was caused by the Xifeng County People's Committee and the Liaoning Provincial Bureau of Culture believing that this group of ancient tombs had no "research value" and mistakenly believed that they had no "preservation value." In fact, it reflects the fact that these two departments did not implement the policy of protecting cultural relics adequately. When the tomb complex was being heavily damaged, the Provincial Bureau of Culture received reports from the county as well as from the masses. The People's Daily forwarded several letters from readers. However, the Bureau of Culture simply forwarded these letters to the county for handling and did nothing more, and never sent professional cadres to investigate and understand the situation. The County People's Committee, after reporting to the Provincial Bureau of Culture, did not take further action to stop it.

    It should be said that this phenomenon of randomly digging ancient tombs is not an isolated one. Several Liao tombs have also been dug in Xinmin, Jianping and other counties. Those who participated in the random digging of ancient tombs were not only the peasant masses, but also many village cadres. They called it increasing "sideline income" and even played an organizational role. In addition to the local villagers, many village officials were involved in the random digging of the Xichagou ancient tombs.

    I think this matter should be taken seriously. The cultural departments should carry out extensive publicity work to make the broad masses of cadres and the people understand the importance of protecting cultural relics. At the same time, some effective measures should be formulated to avoid and prevent the recurrence of similar phenomena.

    西岔沟古墓群被掘事件的教训
    孙守道
    西岔沟在辽宁西丰县乐善乡执中村姜家街西北。在那里，我国第一次发现了属于中国西伯利亚文化的古墓群。根据出土物估计，这群古墓的年代相当于西汉时期，至晚不迟于东汉初期。出土的文物包括两个不同的文化系统，就是汉文化和斯基泰系文化（中央亚细亚铜器文化）。墓群的地点恰在汉代辽东群北边和外族接触最频繁的地方，因此这群古墓的发掘，对研究古代各族文化的交流有重要的意义。
    非常令人痛心的是，这个古代墓地在科学发掘之前，却遭到了惊人的破坏。大批墓葬被掘毁，大量文物在挖出后到处流散，造成了不可弥补的损失。
    这件事情的经过是这样的：
    解放以前，当地就有老乡发现这群古墓中埋有金玉珠宝。解放以后，有个别人就偷偷地进行挖掘。1955年春当地的一些老乡知道了，当时正值农闲，于是一齐上山乱挖。当时，西丰县人民委员会知道这个情况，就一面加以制止，一面报告省文化局，并将老乡们挖出的文物送去鉴定。后来县里听说省文化局认为这批文物不甚古，没有“保存价值”，对乱挖行为就渐渐不加制止了。结果老乡又上山乱掘，规模突然加大，人数竟增至每天数百人。连周围五、六十里地的一些老乡，也都背着行李带着干粮前来挖掘；甚至夜间还点着蜡烛挖，以致附近合作社的蜡烛一时竟销售一空。这种现象一直继续到去年冬天，其间以秋天达到规模最大的程度。古墓被掘得土层灰黄相扰，成千上百个乱掘坑上下相连，密密麻麻，有如弹坑。大小不一，深可过肩，浅则没膝。乱掘出土的文物，据当地群众反映，仅玉石琉璃饰品就可以装上几大筐，铁器、铜器被当做废铜烂铁出卖的何止几百斤。其中出土的宝剑，每家差不多都有一、二把。
    凡所出土的陶器如壶、罐、盆、碗等，几乎件件被就地抛弃击碎。凡所得金制品如金盅、金丝纽扣、穿珠金丝、金片等，或变卖十多元一钱，或自留改用。凡所出铜铁制成的容器、兵器、工具、马具等都卖给收铜商人或合作社收购站。由于有的合作社只收铜不收铁，一些人便把其中占很大数量的铁剑上的各式铜柄打掉卖出。凡所出琉璃、玛瑙和各种玉石饰品，则多私自保藏、相赠或自己佩带。凡小型铜器如“天下大明”镜、星云镜、透孔动物纹饰板、铜马具、大小铜扣、各式铜镞，以及一部分兵器、铁工具、玉器等，也都散于各乡各地，有许多就下落不明。
    就是这样，老乡们单纯为了掘宝挖金子，而将大批完整的地面翻动，墓葬毁坏，因此文物出土的位置搞不清楚。这种破坏性的挖掘行为，直到今年5月，由于西丰县地方国营畜牧场李柏梁同志反映给东北博物馆，才得到完全制止。东北博物馆在接到报告后，就与省文化局联系，派工作队前去清理。现在，清理工作已在9月7日结束。从老乡手中，收回了五千三百多件文物。
    农民群众这样大规模的乱掘古墓，给考古事业造成了不可弥补的损失。总计在墓葬方面，被掘毁的地面约占一万五千平方公尺，恰恰等于原来整个墓群所占的地面。至少有95％的墓葬遭到破坏，其中已掘毁无存的至少占80％以上。文物本身的损失情况已如上述。而这一切，使这群古墓的考古价值，受到巨大的损害。
    这群古墓的考古价值在于：从出土的铜器来讲，这些铜器不仅与内蒙古长城地带所出土的铜器有密切联系，而且与苏联境内所出的斯基泰——西伯利亚文化的青铜器有共同点。将这些青铜器和一部分铁兵器与我国中原铜器和铁兵器相比较，可以看出相互间的影响，若干墓葬中出土的具有原始特征的陶器，陶纺轮和细石器，关系到我国新石器和细石器文化的研究。同时这些墓群对研究匈奴人、乌桓人或鲜卑人的文化，也有很大的价值。现在墓葬被乱掘，大批文物散失，现存文物出土位置无法断定，这就给研究这些问题造成了很大的困难。
    这个不幸事件虽然已经过去半年多了，但是人们仍然要问，造成这个不幸事件的原因是什么呢？
    从表面看来，是因为西丰县人民委员会和辽宁省文化局认为这群古墓没有“研究价值”、误认为没有“保存价值”而引起。事实上却反映了这两个部门对保护文物的政策执行不够。在墓群被大量破坏时，省文化局除了接到县里的报告外，还接到群众的反映。人民日报就转去了好几封读者来信。但是文化局只是把这些信件转到县里去处理就算了事，始终没有派专业干部前去调查了解。而县人民委员会在上报省文化局后，也没有作进一步的制止。
    应该说这种乱掘古墓的现象不是个别的。在新民、建平等县也有几座辽墓被掘。参加乱掘古墓的不光是农民群众，甚至还有不少乡村干部。他们美其名曰增加“副业收入”，还起了组织作用。西岔沟古墓的乱掘者除了当地老乡之外，就有很多乡村负责干部在内。
    我认为这件事情应该引起严重的注意。文化部门应该进行广泛的宣传工作，使广大干部和群众知道保护文物的重要性。同时应该定出一些有效的措施，来避免和制止这种类似现象的重新发生。
