Xinhua News Agency, 31st – The Beijing Municipal People's Committee recently conducted a general inspection of the production reorganization of joint state-private industries.

This inspection revealed that some factories were too large, causing confusion in production management. For example, the Shoe and Hat General Factory had ten branches, distributed in 109 production locations across seven districts, resulting in very chaotic production management. The Zhongli Telephone Factory was divided into seven production locations, with the factory headquarters not understanding the workshop situation and a lack of communication between departments, leading to uneven production and a failure to supply raw materials, resulting in the majority of August's contracts being overdue. In response to this situation, the four local industrial bureaus in Beijing have formulated the first batch of adjustment plans for sixteen factories, preparing to re-divide these factories into forty-five smaller factories based on region and specialization.

The inspection also found that the positions of some private personnel with actual responsibilities were not arranged according to their strengths, and appropriate adjustments are now being made successively. For example, Zhang Zhicai, the former manager of the Northern Spray Paint Factory, was skilled in spray paint technology but was previously assigned as the head of the supply and marketing section of the State Metrology and Measurement Factory. He has now been transferred to the position of deputy director of the Spray Paint Factory.

Problems such as the working relationship between public and private parties in enterprises and the labor conditions in factories are also being addressed while inspections are being carried out.

    北京市检查公私合营工业改组工作
    有的工厂摊子过大管理不便重新分成小厂
    有的私方人员没有发挥所长重新安排职位
    新华社31日讯　北京市人民委员会最近对公私合营工业生产改组工作普遍进行了一次检查。
    这次检查发现，有些工厂由于摊子过大，造成了生产管理上的混乱现象。如鞋帽总厂下设十个分厂，分在一百零九处生产，跨七个区，生产管理很混乱。中利电话机厂分在七处生产，厂部不了解车间情况，科室之间又缺乏联系，因此生产很不均衡，原材料供应不上，以致8月份的合同大部误期。针对这种情况，北京市四个地方工业局已经制定了第一批十六个厂的调整方案，准备把这些厂按地区、按专业重新分成为四十五个小厂。
    检查中发现一些私方实职人员的职务，没有按照特长加以安排，现在也在陆续作适当的调整。如原北方喷漆厂经理张志才，擅长喷漆技术，过去安排为国计度量衡厂供销科长，现在已经调任喷漆厂副厂长。
    对于企业中存在的公私共事关系、工厂劳动条件等问题，也正在一边检查一边解决中。
