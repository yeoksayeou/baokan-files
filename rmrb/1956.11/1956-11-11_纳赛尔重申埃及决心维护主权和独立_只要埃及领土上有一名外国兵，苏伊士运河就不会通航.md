Xinhua News Agency, November 10th, Cairo Dispatch: Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser delivered a speech at Al-Azhar University in Cairo on November 9th, reiterating Egypt's determination to safeguard its sovereignty, independence, territory, and dignity. He stated, "Egypt will never accept any conditions that violate its sovereignty or harm its dignity."

In this speech, broadcast by Cairo Radio, Nasser said that Egypt's freedom and independence must be guaranteed before there can be peace in the Middle East. He said, "We will never surrender. We will fight for our dignity, glory, and motherland."

Nasser said that this is a struggle against perfidy and tyrannical despotism, and also a political struggle. He pointed out that the political struggle he was referring to meant safeguarding Egypt's political rights. He said that as for the military struggle, everyone in this country is prepared for it. We have announced that the Suez Canal will not begin to operate as long as there is a single foreign soldier on our territory.

President Nasser said, "My compatriots, this is our attitude today." "We desire peace, and we will fight for peace. Our feelings today are: unity, strength, work, determination, struggle, and holy war."

President Nasser, in reviewing the Egyptian people's war against the aggressors, said that the Egyptian Air Force was in complete control of the battle against Israel in the Sinai Peninsula before the British and French air forces attacked Egyptian airfields. He said that during the first three days of the Sinai battles, Egyptian aircraft shot down eighteen Israeli aircraft, sacrificing only three Egyptian pilots. During the air battles over the desert on October 31st, Egyptian pilots reported that they saw many French-made Mystère jet fighters in the sky, and Israel did not originally have so many of these aircraft. Nasser said, "We determined that France was determined to secretly send its air force to help Israel. But our air force still had complete control of the battle situation." The Egyptian forces stationed in the Sinai Desert, supported by a superior air force, repelled the Israeli aggressors time and time again. The main force of the Egyptian army was advancing to give the Israeli invasion a fatal blow.

President Nasser said, but then on October 31st, a great betrayal and an act of moral destruction occurred. British bombers bombed Cairo Airport, and under the name of the "Allied Command," Britain and France attacked the Egyptian Air Force.

Nasser said the conspiracy was clear: Britain and France wanted to attack the Egyptian people, hoping that the weakened Egyptian army would be dispersed to deal with Israel. Britain and France tried to make us face Israel empty-handed, so that Britain could say that Israel had defeated Egypt.

Egypt countered this conspiracy by withdrawing its troops from the Sinai Peninsula west to the Suez Canal area, using all its strength to deal with the perfidious British and French offensive.

Nasser said, "Port Said showed the whole world that Egypt will continue to fight and persevere to the end." At this point, the audience cheered loudly.

Nasser said that the bombing that Egypt experienced for the first time only helped to make the people more firm and determined to defend their freedom and independence.

He said that the British thought this battle was very simple. Experts on the island of Cyprus believed that this battle would only take twenty-four hours. However, Port Said frustrated the imperialist conspiracy. Port Said contributed itself to save the entire Egypt.

Nasser said that the spirit of generous sacrifice shown in Port Said and the heroic resistance of the Egyptian people meant that the Anglo-French aggression against Egypt had achieved none of its goals. He pointed out that the British claim that they had destroyed the Egyptian Air Force was just a fantasy. The Egyptian Air Force was deliberately not taking action, and the aircraft that the British said were destroyed on the ground were all fake aircraft made of wood.

He said: "When the British and French air forces sent large numbers of aircraft to bomb, we faced two possibilities: should our air force go up to meet them, or should we give up the airspace to the enemy? We believed that we must thwart their purpose. Despite the protests of our pilots, they were ordered not to take off. If we went to meet the British and French, we would lose our pilots. We put fake aircraft on the airport and used this method to preserve our air force." He pointed out that Eden's plan had failed: "The Egyptian Air Force still exists and is waiting for its turn to perform its mission in battle."

Nasser also said that the loss of non-armored vehicles and other equipment in the Sinai Peninsula battle "has been replenished with things from British warehouses in the Canal Zone."

President Nasser pointed out that the claim that Arab countries were not united in the face of British, French, and Israeli aggression was ridiculous. He said that the Arabs have shown themselves to be united, strong, and determined after experiencing the developments of the past ten days. "Arab nationalism is cooperating with us everywhere to deal with imperialism."

He said that Saudi Arabian King Saud, Jordanian King Hussein, and Syrian President Kuwatli all expressed their willingness to provide assistance, which proves that Arab nationalism is a force today. Nasser said, "King Saud called me and said that the army and money of Saudi Arabia are available for Egypt's use." "My reply was that we are worried about the situation in Jordan, and the Egyptian army is capable of repelling the Israeli aggressors."

"I told Saud to contact Jordan and cooperate with it. On the same day, King Hussein contacted me by phone and said that according to the military agreement between us, he was ready to do whatever the Joint Command wanted him to do. Every word Hussein said was true. My reply was not to open up a new battlefield against Jordan, but to concentrate on the battle between Israel and Egypt."

Nasser also said that Syrian President Kuwatli had also expressed his willingness to join the battle, but he did not accept because he did not want to involve Syria as well.

Nasser also pointed out, "Eden said that he came to defend the Suez Canal. But all he has done is to obstruct the Suez Canal. Today they are starting to cut back on their oil consumption because the supply of oil has been stopped."

Nasser said that the actions of the British and French governments "are like true war criminals, launching a murderous war against the Egyptian people." "Therefore, these criminals are completely isolated on the international stage, and the voices of all people condemn the treacherous aggression."

He said that all over the world, free people everywhere support us. Egypt has defended its sovereignty.

Nasser said that today, our feeling is: we will fight, we will use battle to defend our motherland.

Egypt wants peace, but only when this peace means freedom and independence.

    纳赛尔重申埃及决心维护主权和独立
    “只要埃及领土上有一名外国兵，苏伊士运河就不会通航”
    新华社10日讯　开罗消息：埃及总统阿卜杜勒·纳赛尔11月9日在开罗爱资哈尔大学发表演说，重申埃及决心要维护它的主权、独立、领土和尊严。他说，“埃及决不接受任何侵犯它的主权或危害它的尊严的条件”。
    纳赛尔在这篇由开罗电台广播的演说中说，埃及的自由和独立必须得到保证，而后中东才会有和平。他说，“我们绝不投降。我们将为我们的尊严、光荣和祖国而战斗。”
    纳赛尔说，这是一个反对背信弃义和强暴专制的斗争，也是一个政治斗争。他指出，他所说的政治斗争，就是维护埃及的政治权利的意思。他说，至于军事斗争，这个国家的每一个人都为这种斗争作好了准备。我们已经宣布，只要在我们的领土上还有一名外国兵，苏伊士运河就不会开始通航。
    纳赛尔总统说，“我的同胞们，这就是我们今天的态度。”“我们希望和平，我们要为和平而斗争。我们今天的感情是：团结、力量、工作、决心、斗争和圣战。”
    纳赛尔总统在回顾埃及人民抗击侵略者的战争经过时说，埃及空军在英法空军袭击埃及机场以前完全控制着在西奈半岛进行的抵抗以色列的战役。他说，在西奈战事的头三天期间，埃及飞机击落十八架以色列飞机，只牺牲了三个埃及飞行员。在10月31日在沙漠上空进行空战期间，埃及飞行员报告说，他们看见天空中有许多法国造的神秘式喷气战斗机，而原来以色列并没有这样多的这种飞机。纳赛尔说，“我们断定，法国决心暗中派它的空军帮助以色列。可是我们的空军仍然完全控制着战局。”驻西奈沙漠的埃及部队在占优势的空军支持下一次又一次地击退了以色列侵略者。埃及军队的主力正在向前推进，去给以色列的进犯一个致命的打击。
    纳赛尔总统说，可是接着在10月31日，大背叛和破坏道义的行为发生了。英国的轰炸机轰炸了开罗机场，而在“联军司令部”的名义下，英国和法国攻击了埃及空军。
    纳赛尔说，阴谋是很清楚的：英国和法国是想袭击埃及人民，希望削弱了的埃及军队分散开，去对付以色列。英法力图使我们赤手空拳面对以色列，这样英国就可以说，以色列已经打败了埃及。
    埃及反击了这个阴谋，从西奈半岛把自己的军队西撤到苏伊士运河地区，用它的全部力量来对付背信弃义的英法的进攻。
    纳赛尔说，“塞得港向整个世界表明了：埃及要继续战斗，并坚持到最后。”这时，听众大声欢呼。
    纳赛尔说，埃及第一次经历的轰炸只有助于使人民更加坚定和坚决地维护他们的自由和独立。
    他说，英国人以为这次战斗很简单。塞浦路斯岛上的专家认为这次战斗只需要二十四小时。但是，塞得港挫败了帝国主义的阴谋。塞得港贡献出了自己来拯救整个埃及。
    纳赛尔说，在塞得港表现的慷慨牺牲精神和埃及人的英勇抵抗意味着英法对埃及的侵略什么目标也没有实现。他指出，英国人说他们摧毁了埃及的空军的说法只是空想。埃及的空军是有意识地不采取行动，英国人所说的在地面上击毁的飞机都是木头做的假飞机。
    他说：“当英法空军派遣大批飞机来空袭的时候，我们面对着两个可能性：我们的空军是上去迎击呢，还是把领空让给敌人？我们认为必须挫败他们的目的。尽管我们的驾驶员提出抗议，他们还是奉命不起飞。如果我们去迎击英国人和法国人，我们将会损失我们的驾驶员。我们就把假飞机放在飞机场上，用这种办法来保存我们的空军。”他指出，艾登的打算落空了：“埃及的空军仍然存在，并且正在等待着在战斗中轮到它来执行任务的时候。”
    纳赛尔还说，在西奈半岛战斗中，非装甲的车辆和其他装备的损失“已经用从运河区英国仓库中的东西补充了”。
    纳赛尔总统指出，关于所谓阿拉伯国家在面临英、法、以色列的侵略时没有团结起来的说法是可笑的。他说，阿拉伯人在经历了过去十天的事态发展后显示出是团结、强大和坚毅的。“阿拉伯民族主义到处同我们合作来对付帝国主义。”
    他说，沙特阿拉伯国王沙特、约旦国王侯赛尼和叙利亚总统库阿特利都表示愿意提供援助，这证明了阿拉伯民族主义在今天是一种力量。纳赛尔说，“国王沙特打电话给我说，沙特阿拉伯的军队和金钱都供埃及使用。”“我的答复是，我们担心约旦的情况，而埃及的军队是能够打退以色列侵略者的。”
    “我告诉沙特去同约旦联系，并且同它合作。同一天，侯赛尼国王用电话同我联系说，根据我们之间的军事协定，他准备做联合司令部要他做的任何事情。侯赛尼的每句话都是算数的。我的答复是，不要开辟对约旦的新战场，我们要集中精力在以色列和埃及的战斗上。”
    纳赛尔还说，叙利亚的库阿特利总统也曾经表示愿意加入战斗，但是他没有接受，因为他不愿意把叙利亚也牵连在内。
    纳赛尔还指出，“艾登说，他是来保卫苏伊士运河的。但是他所作的一切都是阻碍苏伊士运河。今天他们开始削减他们石油的消费，因为石油的供应被停止了。”
    纳赛尔说，英法政府的行为“就像真正的战争罪犯一样，对埃及人民发动了谋杀性的战争。”“也就因此，这些罪犯们在国际舞台上是完全孤立的，所有人民的声音都谴责背信的侵略”。
    他说，全世界，每一个地方的自由人民都支持我们。埃及保卫了它的主权。
    纳赛尔说，今天，我们的感情是：我们要战斗，我们要用战斗来保卫我们的祖国。
    埃及要和平，但是只有这种和平意味着自由和独立的时候才要和平。（附图片）
