Xinhua News Agency, November 6th: The Chinese Olympic Committee (All-China Sports Federation) announced today that because the International Olympic Committee has violated the Olympic Charter and continues to insist on inviting Taiwan to send athletes independently to the 16th Olympic Games, Chinese athletes cannot participate in this Olympic Games until this issue is reasonably resolved.

The Chinese Olympic Committee held a Standing Committee meeting on this matter today and decided to notify the President of the International Olympic Committee, Brundage, Secretary-General Meyer, and the Chairman of the Organizing Committee of the 16th Olympic Games, Hughes, of a statement regarding this matter.

The Chinese Olympic Committee pointed out that since 1952, the Chinese Olympic Committee has repeatedly stated to the International Olympic Committee that Taiwan is a province of China, and the sports organizations there are under the leadership of China's national sports organizations. Athletes there must be selected in the nationwide competitions of China before they can participate in the Olympic Games as members of a unified Chinese Olympic delegation. This is fully in line with the provisions of the Olympic Charter, which stipulates that only one National Olympic Committee can be recognized in a country.

However, the International Olympic Committee has blatantly violated this provision, disregarding the repeated and solemn protests of the Chinese Olympic Committee, insisting on recognizing "two Chinese Olympic Committees" and allowing Taiwan to send athletes independently to this Olympic Games. Even more outrageously, the International Olympic Committee has dared to arbitrarily change our country's name, attempting to rename the People's Republic of China as "Beijing China" and calling Taiwan "Formosa China."

Rong Gaotang, Secretary-General of the Chinese Olympic Committee (who was elected Vice-Chairman of the All-China Sports Federation, i.e., the Chinese Olympic Committee, on October 24th), formally protested to the Secretary-General of the IOC, Meyer, on October 22nd regarding these erroneous and absurd measures of the International Olympic Committee. No response has been received to date. Furthermore, the Organizing Committee of the 16th Olympic Games raised the flag of the Kuomintang clique, which has long been spurned by 600 million Chinese people, at the opening ceremony of the Olympic Village on October 29th, further exposing the true face of the International Olympic Committee's conspiracy to deliberately create "two Chinas" under the influence of certain external forces. Dong Shouyi, Deputy Head of the Chinese delegation to the 16th Olympic Games, and Huang Zhong, Secretary-General, arrived in Melbourne on the 4th of this month and immediately demanded that the flag of the Kuomintang clique be lowered, but no reasonable solution was reached.

The Chinese Olympic Committee believes that the various unreasonable measures taken by the International Olympic Committee not only seriously violate the Olympic Charter and tradition but also constitute a serious insult to 600 million Chinese people and all Chinese athletes. The Chinese Olympic Committee expresses its firm protest against this.

### 中国奥林匹克委员会发表声明  抗议国际奥委会制造“两个中国”的阴谋  宣布在取消台湾单独派运动员参加奥运会以前我国将不参加

    中国奥林匹克委员会发表声明
    抗议国际奥委会制造“两个中国”的阴谋
    宣布在取消台湾单独派运动员参加奥运会以前我国将不参加
    新华社6日讯　中国奥林匹克委员会（中华全国体育总会）今天宣布，由于国际奥林匹克委员会违反奥林匹克运动会宪章，直到目前为止还坚持邀请台湾单独派遣运动员参加第十六届奥林匹克运动会，中国的运动员在这一问题没有得到合理解决以前，不能参加本届奥林匹克运动会。
    中国奥林匹克委员会今天就此事召开了常务委员会，并且决定把有关此事的一项声明通知国际奥林匹克委员会主席布伦戴基、秘书长梅耶和第十六届奥林匹克运动会组织委员会主席休斯。
    中国奥林匹克委员会指出：从1952年以来，中国奥林匹克委员会就一直向国际奥林匹克委员会声明，台湾是我国的一个省，那里的体育组织属我国全国性的体育组织的领导，那里的运动员必须在全中国的选拔赛中当选之后才能作为统一的中国奥林匹克代表团的成员参加奥林匹克运动会。这是完全符合奥林匹克运动会宪章关于在一个国家内只能承认一个国家奥林匹克委员会的规定的。
    但是，国际奥林匹克委员会却公然违反这个规定，不顾中国奥林匹克委员会的多次严正抗议，坚持承认“两个中国奥林匹克委员会”，允许台湾单独派遣运动员参加本届奥林匹克运动会。更令人愤慨的是，国际奥林匹克委员会竟敢妄自更改我国的名称，企图将中华人民共和国改称“北京中国”，而把台湾叫作“福摩萨中国”。
    中国奥林匹克委员会秘书长荣高棠（他已在10月24日被选为中华全国体育总会即中国奥林匹克委员会副主席）曾在10月22日就国际奥林匹克委员会以上这些错误的荒谬的措施向该会秘书长梅耶正式提出抗议。迄今没有得到答复。而第十六届奥林匹克运动会组织委员会竟于10月29日在奥林匹克村开幕式时升起了早已为六亿中国人民唾弃的国民党集团的旗帜，更进一步暴露了国际奥林匹克委员会在某些外力影响下，有意制造“两个中国”的阴谋的真面目。中国出席第十六届奥林匹克运动会代表团副团长董守义和秘书长黄中于本月4日到达墨尔本后，立即向该会提出要求降下国民党集团的旗帜，但没有得到合理的解决。
    中国奥林匹克委员会认为，国际奥林匹克委员会种种无理措施不仅严重地违反了奥林匹克运动会的宪章和传统，而且是对六亿中国人民和全中国运动员的严重侮辱。中国奥林匹克委员会对此表示坚决的抗议。
