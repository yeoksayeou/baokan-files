Xinhua News Agency, Prague, November 14th – According to a report by the Czechoslovak News Agency, Ferenc Münnich, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Armed Forces and Public Security of the Hungarian Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Government, received two reporters from the Czechoslovak News Agency on November 12th and spoke to them about the current developments in the Hungarian domestic situation.

Deputy Prime Minister Münnich said that in the early days of the Hungarian incident, Horthy officers returning from abroad immediately seized the initiative and incited domestic reactionary forces. Thus, the danger arose that counter-revolutionary forces would gain complete dominance in the country and usurp power. Currently, anyone can see that Budapest has returned to calm and order, although batches of incorrigible reactionaries and criminals who escaped from prison last week still appear in some places. However, these people are trying to escape and are planning to illegally cross the border into Austria.

In other parts of Hungary, calm and order have also been fully restored. Although railway traffic has not yet fully returned to normal, most of the domestic railway trunk lines have been reopened.

When talking about the urgent economic problems caused by the fight against the counter-revolution, Münnich said that with the help of neighboring fraternal countries, the main difficulties encountered in supplying residents with materials have now been overcome. He said: The electricity supplied by Czechoslovakia greatly contributes to the recovery of the Hungarian economy. Münnich talked about the establishment of a new Hungarian People's Army and public security forces. He said: Most officers and soldiers performed well in the days of crisis, so they will become the core of the new armed forces of the Hungarian People's Republic. Münnich expressed his conviction that Hungary will soon be able to use its own troops to ensure domestic order and normal life.

He also pointed out that the new army will be organized on the basis of thorough reform. The current Hungarian government is a worker-peasant revolutionary government, and it will also prescribe new organizational principles for the Hungarian armed forces. He said: We need such an army and public security organs: they represent the interests of the working class and the working peasants, and defend the socialist achievements and revolutionary fruits of the Hungarian people.

Münnich also talked about the issue of party life, saying: The party has suffered significant losses due to the mistakes made by the past leadership and the brutal persecution carried out by counter-revolutionary bandits. The Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party and its new Provisional Central Committee have launched political activities in the Budapest district and individual factories. In many other places, such as in Bács-Kiskun County and other places, the party organizations have not suffered losses in most cases.

    明尼奇谈匈牙利国内局势的发展
    国内秩序完全恢复，紧迫的经济问题正在解决
    新的武装部队将在彻底革新的基础上组织起来
    新华社布拉格14日电　据捷克斯洛伐克通讯社报道，匈牙利工农革命政府副总理兼武装部队和公安部长费伦茨·明尼奇在11月12日接见了捷克斯洛伐克通讯社的两位记者，向他们谈到了目前匈牙利国内局势的发展。
    明尼奇副总理说，在匈牙利事件刚一开始的那些日子里，从国外回来的霍尔蒂军官们就马上夺取了主动，并且鼓动起来了国内的反动势力。于是就发生了反革命势力将要在国内取得完全优势，并且篡夺政权的危险。目前，任何人都可以看到，布达佩斯也已经恢复了平静和秩序，虽然在某些地方还会出现成批的怙恶不悛的反动分子和在上上星期从监狱里跑出来的罪犯。但是，这些人正在竭力设法逃命，并且还打算非法越界进入奥地利。
    在匈牙利其他各地，也已经完全恢复平静和秩序。虽然铁路交通还没有完全恢复正常，但是国内大多数铁路干线都已经通车。
    明尼奇在谈到由于同反革命作战而发生的紧迫的经济问题的时候说，在邻近的兄弟国家的援助下，在供应居民物资方面所遭遇的主要困难目前已经能够克服。他说：捷克斯洛伐克所供应的电力，大大地有助于匈牙利经济的恢复。明尼奇谈到了建立新的匈牙利人民军和公安部队的问题。他说：大多数军官和士兵在危急的日子里都有良好的表现，因此他们将成为匈牙利人民共和国新的武装部队的核心。明尼奇表示确信：匈牙利不久就能够以自己的部队来保障国内的秩序和正常生活。
    他还指出，新的军队将要在彻底革新的基础上组织起来。现在的匈牙利政府是工农革命政府，它也将要为匈牙利武装部队规定新的组织原则。他说：我们需要这样的军队和公安机关：它们代表着工人阶级和劳动农民的利益，保卫匈牙利人民的社会主义成就和革命成果。
    明尼奇也谈到了关于党的生活的问题，他说：由于过去的领导机构所犯的错误和反革命匪帮所进行的残酷迫害，党遭受了重大的损失。匈牙利社会主义工人党和它的新的临时中央委员会已经在布达佩斯区和个别工厂中展开政治活动。在其他许多地方，例如在巴奇—基什孔州和其他地方，党的组织在大多数的情况下没有遭受损失。
