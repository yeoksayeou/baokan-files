Xinhua News Agency, Montevideo, 23rd: TASS reports that the Central Committee of the Brazilian Communist Party has issued a special resolution on the Hungarian situation. The resolution states that it is intolerable for imperialism and the Horthy group to regain power in Hungary, thereby opening a dangerous gap in the socialist camp and creating a threat to world peace.

The resolution welcomes the struggle of the Hungarian people and the fraternal Soviet armed forces against reactionary forces and war. The resolution says that this struggle has attracted the attention of people in countries like Brazil, who are fighting against imperialist oppression and longing for peace and national independence. The resolution calls on all Brazilian people to support the Hungarian workers and peasants and to condemn fascist counter-revolutionary activities.

Recently, people from all walks of life in Brazil have held various meetings in various cities to support the Hungarian people. At these meetings, representatives of all walks of life, prominent politicians and social figures, and many organizations exposed the conspiracies of the reactionaries in Hungary and condemned the counter-revolutionaries and Western imperialist groups for attempting to eliminate the socialist achievements of the Hungarian working people.

Xinhua News Agency, Buenos Aires, 22nd: TASS reports that the Central Committee of the Argentine Communist Party has issued a letter to the Argentine people regarding the Hungarian events. The letter exposes the provocative fabrications of foreign news agencies regarding the Hungarian events, points out the truth of the Hungarian events, and calls on the Argentine working class and the people of the whole country to support the Hungarian working class, the Hungarian people, and the Hungarian Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government.

The letter condemns the Argentine provisional government's measures to suppress the activities of domestic democratic organizations, and calls on all domestic democratic forces to unite into a united democratic front to block the path of reactionary forces and defend freedom and national independence.
