Xinhua News Agency, November 17th: According to a United Press Beirut dispatch: Syrian Foreign Minister Bitar said on the 16th that the best way to solve the current Middle East problem would be for British and French troops to withdraw from Egypt in accordance with United Nations regulations. He said: "If the United Nations Organization does not implement its decisions, everyone has the right to receive assistance from anywhere and anyone they can obtain it from."

Before departing for home after attending the Arab Heads of State Conference, Bitar also charged that British and French aircraft were appearing over Syrian airports almost daily, and they were met with resistance from Syrian anti-aircraft guns. He denied reports that Soviet jet aircraft and pilots had arrived in Syria. He told United Press reporters that spreading such news was probably intended to scare American public opinion.

Bitar said that some people in the Middle East may have once thought that Britain was neutral on the issue of Arabs and Israelis. He said, however, that Britain and France have now exposed their true colors and are acting according to a carefully formulated plan with Israel. He said: "The United States should prohibit British and French intervention in Egypt."

    叙外长要英法从埃及撤军
    并指责英法飞机侵犯叙利亚领空
    据新华社17日讯　据合众社贝鲁特消息：叙利亚外交部长比塔尔16日说，解决目前中东问题的最好的方法将是英法军队按照联合国的规定从埃及撤走。他说：“如果联合国组织没有实施它的决定，每个人都有权利从他能够得到援助的任何地方和任何人那里接受援助。”
    比塔尔在参加阿拉伯国家首脑会议以后启程回国的时候，还指责说，英法飞机差不多每天都在叙利亚各机场的上空出现，它们遭到叙利亚高射炮的抗击。他否认说苏联的喷气式飞机和驾驶员已经到达叙利亚的消息。他对合众社记者说，散布这种消息可能是为了吓唬美国舆论。
    比塔尔说，中东有些人一度可能认为英国在有关阿拉伯人和以色列人的问题上是中立的，他说，但是，英国和法国现在暴露了真面目，他们按照同以色列仔细拟订的计划行事。他说：“美国应当禁止英法对埃及的干涉。”
