Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, November 7th: Ninety-seven units from the industrial, commercial, and handicraft systems of Tianjin Municipality were awarded by the Tianjin Foreign Trade Bureau on the 6th for actively supplying export goods and supporting national foreign trade.

Since the beginning of this year, the Renli Woolen Mill, Tianjin Egg Factory, and the Second Food Processing Factory have consistently fulfilled their supply plans in terms of quality, quantity, and on time for major export commodities such as woolen fabrics, blankets, egg products, and frozen meat. The technicians and workers of the Tianjin Dyestuff Factory manufactured the only vulcanized blue dye in the country with a coloring rate of 200%, which is of good quality and low cost. The towels and bath towels woven by the First Towel Production Cooperative are of particularly good quality, with a first-class product rate of over 97%. Employees of the Second Food Processing Factory adopted the "rosin hair removal method" to solve the problem of incomplete hair removal from pigskin, resulting in a white and smooth skin surface, which has been well received by foreign merchants.

Thanks to the active support from all parties, the total value of export commodities from Tianjin's five relevant export corporations, including miscellaneous goods and food products, is expected to double this year compared to last year.

At the award ceremony held on the 6th, Fan Yongzhong, Director of the Tianjin Foreign Trade Bureau, thanked these units for their support and presented them with pennants, cash, and goods in kind. He said that in the future, the foreign trade system will strengthen its ties with various production units to better coordinate with each other and do a good job in the country's export work.
