Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 31st - A highly elastic nylon sock, suitable for both men and women, will be officially produced by the Shanghai Joint Public-Private Kangfu Weaving Factory starting in November.

These socks, woven from elastic nylon (synthetic fiber), can be stretched by 30% to 40% at will. Therefore, the same size can fit both larger and smaller feet. The heel and toe of these socks are double-layered, and each pair can last as long as three or four pairs to five or six pairs of ordinary cotton socks.

Two months ago, Kangfu Weaving Factory successfully test-produced the first pair of elastic nylon socks. In preparation for mass production, the factory has now produced samples of elastic nylon socks in various colors and patterns.

Kangfu Weaving Factory is famous for specializing in the production of "Kangfu Brand" fancy socks and has nearly thirty years of experience in producing fancy socks. Currently, the factory is also actively preparing to resume production of some high-end fancy socks that have been out of production for a long time, as well as new styles. These include nylon stockings, jacquard mesh socks woven with silk and rayon, and reinforced-sole fancy socks.

    尼隆袜
    新华社上海31日电　一种伸缩性很强、男女都能穿的弹力尼隆袜，将由上海公私合营康福织造厂在11月份起正式生产。
    用带有弹性的尼隆（合成纤维）织成的这种袜子，可以随意伸长30％到40％。因此同一个号码，脚大脚小都可以穿。这种袜子的前后跟都是双层，每双可抵三四双到五六双普通线袜穿。
    康福织造厂在两个月以前，就已经试织成功第一双弹力尼隆袜。为了准备大量生产，这个工厂现在又做出了多种颜色和花样的弹力尼隆袜样品。
    康福织造厂是以专门生产“康福牌”花袜著名的，有近三十年的生产花袜的经验。目前这个厂还在积极准备恢复生产一部分停产已久的和新式的高级花袜。其中有尼隆丝袜、真丝和人造丝交织的提花网眼线袜，以及夹底花袜等。
