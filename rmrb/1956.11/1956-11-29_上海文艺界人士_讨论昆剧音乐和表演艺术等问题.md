Shanghai Literary and Art Circles
Discuss Kunqu Opera Music and Performing Arts Issues
(Xinhua News Agency dispatch) Shanghai and Beijing theatrical and other literary and art workers recently held a Kunqu Opera performance viewing in Shanghai, during which they launched a discussion on the music, scripts, and performances of Kunqu Opera. Many people in the music group felt that although Kunqu Opera music has instruments such as the flute, pipa, and xiao, it is still relatively monotonous and other instruments should be added appropriately. The use of gongs and drums in Kunqu Opera lacks variation and should also be improved. Some people believed that the musical rules of Kunqu Opera are very strict, which limits the actors' performances, and proposed to reform the use of musical modes by selectively using them. The script group focused on discussing how to deal with the performance of traditional repertoire. Most people believe that except for a small number of plays with serious reactionary content that should not be performed, most traditional plays should be sorted out, adapted, and performed in order to diversify the repertoire.

Everyone gave high praise to Kunqu Opera's rich and beautiful performing arts. Among the more than eighty plays in this Kunqu Opera performance viewing, many plays have profound and detailed performing arts, and the dance movements are also very beautiful. Everyone believes that the famous Kunqu Opera actor Han Shichang in "The Peony Pavilion" performed the feelings of a young girl in love very movingly. Bai Yunsheng in this play, the ethereal and slow pace of the play, is also very successful in expressing a character's dreamlike state. Everyone believes that these exquisite performances created by these famous actors over decades of hard work should be recorded and preserved. The performance group also discussed the characteristics of Kunqu Opera performances in the North and South, analyzed and discussed the traditions of Kunqu Opera performing arts, and studied the vocabulary of Kunqu Opera stage movements.

At the forum, everyone also discussed how Kunqu Opera can absorb the advantages of other opera genres to enrich and develop Kunqu Opera. The content of these discussions will be written into academic papers for reference by the theatrical community and Kunqu Opera researchers.

    上海文艺界人士
    讨论昆剧音乐和表演艺术等问题
    据新华社讯　上海和北京的一些戏剧和其他文艺工作者，最近在上海举行昆剧观摩演出的期间，对昆剧的音乐、剧本、表演等问题展开了讨论。音乐组的许多人认为昆剧音乐虽然有笛、琵琶、箫等器乐，但还是比较单调，应当适当增加其他乐器。昆剧中锣鼓的使用缺乏变化，也应该改进。有人认为昆剧音乐格律很严，限制了演员的表演，提议以折用曲牌来改革曲牌的运用。剧本组集中讨论了如何对待传统剧目演出的问题。大多数人认为除了少数有严重反动性的剧目不宜演出以外，对大多数传统剧目都应当整理和改编演出，这样才能使上演剧目多样化。
    大家对昆剧丰富、优美的表演艺术给予很高评价。在这次昆剧观摩演出的八十多个剧目中，有不少剧目的表演艺术深刻细致，舞蹈身段也很优美。大家认为著名昆剧演员韩世昌在“游园惊梦”中，把一个少女怀春的心情表演得十分动人。白云生在这一剧中，飘渺缓慢的步伐对表现一个人物所处的幻梦境地，也显得非常成功。大家认为这些名演员几十年辛勤劳动而创造出来的各种精湛的表演，应该纪录下来，加以保留。表演组还讨论了南北昆剧表演特点，分析、探讨了昆剧表演艺术的传统，研究了昆剧舞台动作的语汇。
    在座谈会上，大家还讨论了昆剧如何吸收其他剧种的优点，来丰富和发展昆剧。这些讨论内容，将写成学术论文，供戏剧界及昆剧研究者参考。
