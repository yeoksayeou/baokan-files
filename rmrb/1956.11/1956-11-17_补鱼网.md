    Mending Fishing Nets
    Huang Shan
    The moon is out,
    The girls are going to mend nets,
    They sing songs as they come to the open ground,
    The young men are calling with flutes.
    The girls take out the net needles from their bags,
    Mending the nets while laughing:
    "Let them shout until their throats are sore,
    We'll still mend our own nets."
    The young men are going out to sea to fish tomorrow,
    Tonight they must play and sing with the girls,
    The girls say: "Blow as hard as you can,
    Whether we sing or not is up to our hearts."
    How could the girls not sing,
    As soon as the flute sounds, their throats start to itch,
    The young men stretch their necks and just keep playing the flute,
    The girls unconsciously start singing.
      April 1956 at the Zhoushan Dongsheng Fisheries Cooperative

    补鱼网
    荒山
    月亮出来了，
    姑娘们要去补网，
    她们唱着歌子来到空场上，
    小伙子们拿着笛子在呼唤。
    姑娘们掏出袋里的网梭，
    一边补网，一边笑了：
    “让他们喊破了喉咙吧，
    我们还是补自己的网”。
    小伙子明天就要下海捕鱼去了，
    今晚说什么也得和姑娘们玩玩唱唱，
    姑娘们说：“有劲你们尽管吹吧，
    唱不唱由我们心中所爱。”
    姑娘们哪能不唱呀，
    笛音一响起来她们就嗓子发痒，
    小伙子伸着脖子只管吹笛，
    姑娘们不知不觉唱了起来。
