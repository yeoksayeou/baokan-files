Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, November 23rd: Since many areas in Fujian Province relaxed the management of rural markets, farmers' enthusiasm for sideline production and small native and special products has greatly increased.

Since Jinjiang Special District's nine counties relaxed market management for chickens, ducks, vegetables, fresh fish, etc., in late August, farmers know that after completing the state plan for pig raising, they can also slaughter and sell them themselves. In September and October, they increased the number of pigs raised by 110,000. In October, more than 50,000 farmers in Fuqing County were engaged in sideline production, increasing the number of pigs raised by 6,351; sheep by more than 4,600; and chickens, ducks, rabbits, etc. by more than 74,000. Fishermen and their families in coastal areas of Lianjiang County went to the beaches to collect aquatic shellfish and sell them in baskets on the market. In mountainous areas such as Jian'ou, Fu'an, and Sha County, the production of many small local and special products that had been suspended for a long time has been restored. The production of native paper in Changqi Township, Zherong County, has recently doubled compared to the past month. In the past, the reduction in charcoal production in mountainous areas affected the supply to cities; since October, about one million dan of firewood and charcoal have been transferred from more than ten counties including Sha County to Fuzhou, and the supply in both urban and rural areas is abundant.

According to statistics from Shuangjiang Agricultural Cooperative in Fu'an, due to the recovery and development of sideline and local specialty production, the average income of each member can be increased by 18 yuan by the end of the year.

    福建放宽市场管理后
    农村副业生产增加
    新华社福州23日电　福建省许多地区放宽农村市场的管理后，农民对副业和小土产和特产品的生产积极性大大提高。
    晋江专区九个县自8月下旬放宽对鸡鸭、蔬菜、鲜鱼等市场管理后，农民知道养猪完成国家计划以后，还可以自宰销售，在9、10两个月内就增养了毛猪十一万只。福清县在10月份有五万多个农民兼搞副业生产，计增养了毛猪六千三百五十一头；羊四千六百多只；鸡、鸭、兔等七万四千多只。连江县沿海渔民和家属都到海滩拣拾水产贝类，提篮上市叫卖。建瓯、福安、沙县等山区许多停顿已久的小土特产生产都已恢复起来。柘荣县长岐乡土纸最近一个月的生产量比过去增加了一倍多。过去一个时期，山区柴炭减产，影响到城市的供应；10月以来，自沙县等十多县调到福州的柴炭就达一百万担左右，城乡供应都很充裕。
    据福安双江农业社的统计，由于副业和土特产生产的恢复和发展，到年底平均每个社员可增加收入十八元。
