Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, 2nd. The Polish newspaper "People's Tribune" published an editorial on the 1st, stating that the Soviet government's statement on the basis of developing and further strengthening the friendship and cooperation between the Soviet Union and other socialist countries is an important event in international relations. Eliminating the mistakes and distortions left by the past era in the relationship between the Soviet Union and various socialist countries is an important step in strengthening this relationship. The Polish public warmly welcomes this statement by the Soviet government.

The editorial pointed out that the alliance between Poland and the Soviet Union, established on the basis of complete equality between the two parties and the sovereignty of the two countries, is in the vital interests of the Polish state. In Poland, no one has forgotten that it was thanks to the Soviet Union that we regained freedom after the Second World War. No one in Poland has forgotten that the Soviet Union has consistently taken a clear attitude towards our recovered territories and western borders from the beginning to the present. This is the only major country among the countries occupying Germany that has taken such a stand so far, and it is also the only country that guarantees our territorial integrity diplomatically and from a military point of view.

Regarding the issue of Soviet troops stationed in Poland, the editorial stated that Soviet troops are stationed in Poland primarily based on the Potsdam Treaty and the Warsaw Treaty. Their main task is to ensure the transportation lines from the Soviet Union to the German Democratic Republic. As long as there are US, British, and French bases in West Germany, and as long as Western countries have troops stationed there, it is necessary and justified for Soviet troops to be stationed in the German Democratic Republic. If all foreign troops withdraw from Germany, a completely different situation will arise. But unfortunately, such proposals repeatedly made by the Soviet Union and Poland have always been rejected by Western countries.

Therefore, the problem we face is: how to reconcile the people's and the government's desire to obtain full sovereignty with the recognized necessity of the existence of Soviet troops' transportation lines in Poland, while Soviet troops not only defend the vital interests of the Soviet Union but also defend the vital interests of the People's Republic of Poland, defending the interests of the Polish state.

We are fully confident that other unresolved issues between our two countries, including economic issues, will also be resolved.

However, in addition to the part of the Soviet declaration related to Poland, it should also be explained that its significance is by no means limited to our country alone. The purpose of the Soviet government's declaration is actually to eliminate all the consequences left over from the old era and all obstacles that hinder socialist countries from developing deep and sincere friendship. There is no doubt that this declaration also draws lessons from the tragic events in Hungary.

At a time when British and French troops are carrying out blatant military aggression against Egypt, the Soviet declaration will undoubtedly arouse a wide response from world public opinion. This declaration will show all those who attempt to use the events of the past few days to equate capitalism and socialism that there is no and cannot be any similarity between the two, because the essence of imperialism is expansionist and aggressive, while in the socialist world, even if the mistakes and deviations that have been made are very unfortunate, they are being eliminated.

In our country, the Soviet declaration will undoubtedly be welcomed by the vast majority of the people, who in the recent developments have learned how to closely combine a firm patriotic stance with calmness, discipline, and an understanding of the interests of the Polish state.

Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, 2nd. According to TASS, Sofia, 1st: The Bulgarian newspaper "Workers' Cause" commented on the Soviet government's declaration on the basis of developing and further strengthening the friendship and cooperation between the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, saying: In the declaration, the Soviet government expressed its sincere hope to establish and develop political, economic, cultural, and military ties with other socialist countries on the basis of complete equality. The Bulgarian people cherish the pure and vigorous Soviet-Bulgarian friendship as they cherish the apple of their eye, firmly stand in the big family of socialist countries, and are ready to defend the historically significant achievements obtained under the leadership of the Bulgarian Communist Party.

The newspaper concluded by saying that our people completely share the belief expressed in the Soviet government's declaration, that is, the people of all socialist countries will never allow domestic and foreign reactionary forces to shake the foundations of the people's democratic system. The Bulgarian people believe that everyone will do their best to further develop the socialist system in every socialist country. Our people will fight together with other socialist countries to consolidate the fraternal unity and mutual assistance of socialist countries, and to consolidate the great cause of peace and socialism.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 2nd. "Neues Deutschland" published an editorial on the 1st entitled "Do Not Forget the Imperialist Encirclement," commenting on the Soviet government's declaration on the basis of developing and further strengthening the friendship and cooperation between the Soviet Union and other socialist countries.

The editorial said that this statement reaffirmed its principles for relations with other socialist countries. The working people of the German Democratic Republic deeply feel that the Soviet Union's policy towards other countries, especially towards the German Democratic Republic, is completely different from the policies of imperialist countries.

The editorial continued by saying that the Warsaw Treaty was signed due to the existence of the imperialist military alliance. When discussing the issue of the stationing of Soviet troops, we must not ignore the necessary security issue of preventing imperialist aggression. The best way is to abolish the North Atlantic Alliance and the Warsaw Treaty simultaneously, as suggested by the Soviet Union. The editorial emphasized that the people of the German Democratic Republic clearly know that as long as the imperialist military alliance exists, the threat to socialist countries also exists, and therefore it is necessary to take joint measures to strengthen their defense forces.

The editorial concluded by pointing out that the unity among socialist countries is one of the most important factors in the immense strength of the socialist cause. Allowing this unity to be broken will only help extend the life of imperialism.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 2nd. The Czechoslovak newspaper "Rude Pravo" published an editorial on the 1st, stating that the Soviet government's declaration of October 30th demonstrates the firm principles of the Soviet Union's policy in its relations with people's democratic countries. These are Lenin's principles of equality among all nations, respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, national independence, and non-interference in internal affairs. The Soviet government's declaration did not in the least conceal the necessity of eliminating some incorrect things and errors that had weakened the principles of proletarian internationalism in the relations between socialist countries during the period of the spread of the personality cult.

The publication of the Soviet government's declaration at this time is of great significance. Its significance will grow as time goes on. It is frank, sincere, and pragmatic, and at the same time filled with deep attention and concern for the consolidation and further victorious advancement of our common socialist cause.

The editorial pointed out that the Soviet government has never and will never impose friendship and help on nations and countries that do not want it. The strength of our socialist countries lies in the unity of our countries and in our ability to help each other in all aspects on an equal footing. The strength of the revolutionary socialist movement and the fate of socialist countries themselves depend first and foremost on the fact that the Communist Parties of each country must not only have a complete sense of responsibility for the fate of their own nation and country, but also should have a sense of responsibility for our entire movement, for the fate of socialism and communism. Disregarding the entire communist movement and putting one's own problems to the fore will lead to the activation of nationalistic tendencies.

At the same time, we must note that the weakening of the unity of the people of socialist countries will only help our enemies. We will unite more closely, consolidate our friendship and alliance with the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union, and consolidate our unity with all democratic and peaceful forces in the world.

The editorial concluded by saying that our friendship with the Soviet Union is unshakable. We know who our true friends are and who are pretending to be friends. We will never abandon the correct path of building socialism. We clearly tell our enemies: Do not even think of encroaching on the fruits of our people's democratic system and our friendship with the Soviet Union.

Xinhua News Agency, 2nd. According to the Yugoslav News Agency, the "Borba" of November 1st emphasized that the Soviet government's declaration on relations between socialist countries has undoubtedly great international significance because it provides a positive basis for adjusting relations between socialist countries and promoting cooperation between socialist countries.

"Borba" said that the Soviet government openly pointed out in its declaration that up to now, there have been abnormal phenomena and errors in the relations between socialist countries, "These have damaged the principle of socialist equality." The newspaper added that the Soviet government emphasized that relations between socialist countries should be established on the principles of complete national independence and equality, and that in socialist construction, it is necessary to take into account the specific conditions of each individual country. There is no doubt that only by constantly and consistently implementing these Leninist principles of socialist internationalism can all errors be eliminated from the mutual relations between socialist countries, and socialism can have its full attractiveness.

"Borba" emphasized that the Soviet government's decisions will undoubtedly arouse a sympathetic resonance in all socialist countries.

"Borba" finally pointed out that the Soviet government's decision was announced precisely at a time when someone carried out aggression against Egypt in order to undermine the independence of Egypt and its sovereignty over the Suez Canal. In this case, all measures to strengthen the democratic principles of international cooperation and positive steps taken to resolve relations with other countries on the basis of respect for sovereignty are particularly valuable because doing so helps the international community clear dangerous obstacles on the path to peace.

Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, 2nd. The Mongolian newspaper "Unen" published an editorial on the 1st entitled "Strive to Consolidate the Unity and Common Cooperation of the Countries of the Socialist Camp," saying that the Soviet government's declaration on the basis of developing and further strengthening the friendship and cooperation between the Soviet Union and other socialist countries is an important document of historical significance, fully demonstrating the peaceful foreign policy of friendly cooperation between the Soviet Union and other socialist countries.

The editorial pointed out that under the principles of internationalism, peace, equality, and mutual benefit, the cooperative relations between socialist countries are increasingly strengthened, and the strength of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and China is increasingly strong and consolidated.

Referring to Mongolian-Soviet relations, the editorial said that Mongolia and the Soviet Union have a 35-year history of friendly relations, and the development of Mongolian-Soviet friendly relations has enabled the Mongolian people to achieve great achievements in socialist construction.

The editorial said that in the current international situation, further consolidating the people's democratic regime is an important task for the working people of all people's democratic countries, and the working people must be vigilant.

### 社会主义国家舆论热烈欢迎苏联政府宣言

    社会主义国家舆论热烈欢迎苏联政府宣言
    波兰“人民论坛报”
    新华社华沙2日电　波兰“人民论坛报”1日发表社论说，苏联政府关于发展和进一步加强苏联同其他社会主义国家的友谊和合作的基础的声明是国际关系上的重要事件。消除过去时代在苏联同各个社会主义国家的关系中所留下的错误和歪曲是加强这种关系的重要步骤。波兰的公众很欢迎苏联政府的这个声明。
    社论指出，在两党完全平等和两国主权的基础上建立的波兰同苏联的联盟是波兰国家的切身利益。在波兰，谁都没有忘记，是靠了苏联，我们才在第二次世界大战以后恢复自由的。波兰也没有一个人忘记，苏联从一开始到现在，对于我们收复的领土和西部边界，是始终如一地采取明确态度的。这是到现在为止，在占领德国的国家中采取这样立场的唯一大国，也是在外交上，和从军事观点来说保障我们领土完整的唯一国家。
    社论在谈到苏联驻军的问题时说，苏联军队驻扎在波兰首先是根据波茨坦条约和华沙条约。他们的主要任务是保证从苏联通向德意志民主共和国的交通线。只要西德还设有美英法的基地，只要西方国家还在那里驻有军队，苏联军队就有必要和有理由驻扎在德意志民主共和国。如果所有外国军队从德国撤退，那就会产生一个完全不同的局面。但是不幸，苏联和波兰多次提出的这样的建议总是被西方国家拒绝了。
    因此，我们所面临的问题是：怎样把人民和政府要获得全部主权的愿望，同苏联军队交通线存在于波兰的得到了承认的必要性相调和起来，而苏联军队不仅保卫苏联的切身利益，而且也保卫着波兰人民共和国的切身利益，保卫着波兰国家的利益。
    我们完全相信，我们两国之间其他尚未解决的问题，包括经济问题在内，也是会得到解决的。
    但是除了苏联宣言中有关波兰的部分外，还应该说明，它的重要意义是决不止于我国一国的。苏联政府宣言的目的实际上是要消除旧时代所遗留下来的一切后果以及妨碍社会主义国家在发展深刻的诚挚的友谊方面的一切障碍。没有疑问，这一宣言还从匈牙利悲惨的教训中作出了结论。
    在这英法军队对埃及进行明目张胆的军事侵略的时候，苏联宣言无疑将引起世界舆论的广泛响应。这个宣言将向所有那些企图利用过去几天的事件来把资本主义和社会主义相提并论的人们表明，二者毫无而且也不可能有任何相似之处，因为帝国主义的本质是扩张性的和侵略性的，而在社会主义世界中，已经犯的错误和偏差即使是十分不幸的，但是却正在消除。
    在我国，苏联的宣言无疑地将会得到全国绝大多数人民的欢迎，我国的人民在最近的事态发展过程中懂得了怎样把坚定的爱国主义立场同镇静、纪律性和对于波兰国家利益的认识密切地结合在一起。
    保加利亚“工人事业报”
    新华社2日讯　据塔斯社索非亚1日讯：保加利亚“工人事业报”就苏联政府关于发展和进一步加强苏联同其他社会主义国家的友谊和合作的基础的宣言发表评论说：苏联政府在宣言中表示真诚地希望在完全平等的基础上建立和发展同其他社会主义国家的政治、经济、文化和军事联系。保加利亚人民像爱护自己眼珠一样地爱护纯洁而朝气蓬勃的保苏友谊，坚决站在社会主义国家的大家庭里，准备为保卫在保加利亚共产党领导下所获得的具有历史意义的成果。
    报纸最后说，我国人民和苏联政府宣言中所表示的信念完全相同，那就是各社会主义国家的人民绝不容许国内外反动势力动摇人民民主制度的基础。保加利亚人民相信，大家会竭尽全力使社会主义制度在每个社会主义国家中更加发展。我国人民将和其他社会主义国家一起，为巩固社会主义国家的兄弟团结和互助，为巩固伟大的和平与社会主义事业而奋斗。
    民主德国“新德意志报”
    新华社柏林2日电　“新德意志报”1日发表了题为“不要忘记帝国主义的包围”的社论，评论苏联政府关于发展和进一步加强苏联同其他社会主义国家的友谊和合作的基础的宣言。
    社论说，这个声明重申了它对其他社会主义国家关系的原则。德意志民主共和国的劳动人民深刻体会到，苏联对待其他国家，特别是对待德意志民主共和国的政策是与帝国主义国家的政策截然不同的。
    社论接着说，华沙条约是由于帝国主义的军事联盟的存在而签订的。我们在讨论苏军驻扎问题的时候，绝对不能忽视为防止帝国主义侵略的必要安全问题。最好的途径是按照苏联的建议同时废除北大西洋联盟和华沙条约。社论强调指出，德意志民主共和国人民清楚地知道，只要帝国主义的军事联盟存在，对社会主义国家的威胁也就存在，因而也就有必要采取联合措施来加强自己的防卫力量。
    社论最后指出，社会主义国家间的团结是社会主义事业无比强大的重要因素之一，容许这种团结决裂只会有助于帝国主义寿命的延续。
    捷克斯洛伐克“红色权利报”
    新华社布拉格2日电　捷克斯洛伐克“红色权利报”1日发表社论说，苏联政府10月30日发表的宣言表明了苏联在同人民民主国家关系中的政策的坚定原则。这就是列宁关于各民族一律平等、尊重主权完整、国家独立和不干涉内政的原则。苏联政府的宣言一点也没有掩盖有必要消除在个人崇拜传播的时期中造成的一些削弱了社会主义国家关系中的无产阶级国际主义原则的不正确的东西和错误。
    苏联政府宣言在这个时候公布具有重大的意义。它的意义将随着时期的前进而增长。它是坦白的、诚恳的、实事求是的，而同时又充满了对于我们共同社会主义事业的巩固和进一步胜利前进的深厚的注意和关怀。
    社论指出，苏联政府从来没有而且将来也不会把友好和帮助强加在那些不愿意要的民族和国家身上。我们社会主义国家的力量在于我们各国的团结一致，在于我们能在平等的基础在各方面互相帮助。革命的社会主义运动的力量以及各国社会主义本身的命运首先取决于各国共产党不仅要有对本民族和国家的命运的完全的责任感，而且也应当对于我们整个运动，对社会主义和共产主义的命运具有责任感。不顾整个共产主义运动而光把自己的问题提到前列，这就会引起民族主义倾向的活跃。
    同时，我们必须注意到社会主义各国人民的团结的削弱只会帮助我们的敌人。我们将更加紧密地团结起来，更加巩固我们同以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国的友好和同盟，巩固我们同全世界一切民主和和平力量的团结。
    社论最后说，我们对苏联的友好是不可动摇的。我们知道谁是我们真正的朋友，谁是假装的朋友。我们决不放弃建设社会主义的正确道路。我们明确地告诉敌人们：休要想来侵犯我们人民民主制度的成果和我们同苏联的友谊。
    南斯拉夫“战斗报”
    新华社2日讯　据南斯拉夫通讯社报道：11月1日的“战斗报”强调指出，苏联政府关于社会主义各国关系的宣言有无可怀疑的巨大的国际意义，因为它为调整社会主义各国的关系和促进社会主义各国的合作提供了积极的基础。
      “战斗报”说，苏联政府在它的宣言中公开指出，迄今为止，社会主义国家之间的关系中是有不正常的现象和错误的，
  “这些有损社会主义平等的原则”。报纸又说，苏联政府强调社会主义各国的关系应当建立在完全的民族独立和平等的原则上，在社会主义建设中，必须考虑到每一个个别国家的具体条件。毫无疑问，只有经常地和一贯地执行这些社会主义国际主义的列宁主义原则才能从社会主义国家之间的相互关系中消除一切错误，并使社会主义具有它的全部的吸引力。
    “战斗报”强调指出，苏联政府的这些决定无疑将在所有的社会主义国家中引起赞同的共鸣。
    “战斗报”最后指出，苏联政府的决定正是在有人为了破坏埃及的独立和它对苏伊士运河的主权而对埃及实行了侵略的时候宣布的。在这种情况下，一切加强国际合作的民主原则的措施和采取目的在于在尊重主权的基础上解决同其他国家的关系的积极步骤是特别有价值的，因为这样做有助于国际社会清除在和平道路上的危险障碍。
    蒙古“真理报”
    新华社乌兰巴托2日电　蒙古“真理报”1日发表了题为“为巩固社会主义阵营各国的团结和共同合作而奋斗”的社论说，苏联政府关于发展和进一步加强苏联同其他社会主义国家的友谊和合作的基础的宣言是一个有历史意义的重要文件，充分显示了苏联和其他社会主义国家友好合作的和平外交政策。
    社论指出，在国际主义和平等互利的原则下，社会主义国家彼此间的合作关系日益加强，以苏联、中国为首的社会主义阵营的力量日益强大和巩固。
    社论在谈到蒙苏关系的时候说，蒙古和苏联有着三十五年的友好关系，蒙苏友好关系的发展，使蒙古人民在社会主义建设中获得巨大成就。
    社论说，在目前国际形势下，进一步巩固人民民主政权是各人民民主国家劳动人民的重要任务，劳动人民要提高警惕。
