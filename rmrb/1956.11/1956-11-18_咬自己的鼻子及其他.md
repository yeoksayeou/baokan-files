Biting One's Own Nose and Others
Wei Jinzhi

Two people, A and B, were fighting. A bit off B's nose, and B went to court to file a complaint.

The official asked A, "Why did you bite off B's nose?"

A denied it, saying that B bit it off himself.

The official said, "The mouth is below, and the nose is above, how could he bite it?"

A immediately said, "Your Honor, you don't know, he stepped on a bed to bite it, so he bit it! He deliberately bit off his own nose to frame me, so that I would go to jail! How venomous his heart is!"

        Cuttlefish

Cuttlefish have a special skill. When someone tries to catch them, they tuck all eight legs into their mouths, hiding their mouths under their bellies; then they release a cloud of ink, obscuring their bodies so people can't catch them.

Fishermen, of course, can't see the cuttlefish, but they know the cuttlefish must be hiding in the black water, so they cast a net into the black water and catch the cuttlefish securely.

      Half a Catty Against Eight Ounces

The grandson of a certain prime minister squandered all his family fortune and had nothing to eat, so he often borrowed rice from others. Once, he borrowed another bag of rice, but he couldn't carry it halfway, so he had to rest by the roadside. At this moment, a poor man in tattered clothes walked by, and he stopped the man, agreed on a wage, and asked him to carry the rice for him. Unexpectedly, after walking a short distance, the man was also panting and unable to move. So he complained, "I am the grandson of the prime minister, unable to lift or carry anything, which is normal; you are from a poor background, why are you so useless?"

The man also rolled his eyes and said, "How can you blame me? I am also the grandson of a Minister!"

        Tree Branch

People in mountain villages often use ready-made tree branches as stool legs.

One day, one of these stool legs broke, and the father told his son to find a replacement in the mountains and forests. The son took an axe and went out, wandering around the mountain all day, but returned empty-handed.

The father asked, "What happened?"

The son replied with a worried face, "There are plenty of tree branches, but they all grow upwards, and I couldn't find one that grows downwards!"

        Satisfaction

Someone met a god on the road. This god was an old friend of his. Seeing that he was having a hard life, he pointed at a brick by the roadside and turned it into a gold brick, giving it to him. He was still not satisfied, so the god pointed again, turning a large stone lion into a golden lion, and gave it to him as well. But he still thought it was too little.

The god asked him, "What would make you satisfied?"

The person hesitated for a while and said, "I want your finger!"

    咬自己的鼻子及其他
    魏金枝
    甲乙两人打架，甲咬落了乙的鼻子，乙便去告状。
    官问甲：“你为什么咬落乙的鼻子？”
    甲不承认，说是乙自己咬下来的。
    官说：“口在下，鼻在上，怎么咬得着？”
    甲马上说：“大人，你不知道，他是踏着床去咬的，所以便咬着了！他故意咬下自己的鼻子来陷害我，好叫我坐监坐牢！他的心多毒啊！”
        墨　鱼
    墨鱼有一种特技，碰到有人捉它，它就把八只脚往嘴里一?，连嘴也藏在肚子下；然后放出一股墨水，遮住自己的身体，不让人们捉住它。
    渔人固然看不见墨鱼了，但知道墨鱼一定躲在黑水里，便向黑水中撒下网去，把墨鱼稳稳当当地捉了上来。
    ——以上两则出自“古今谭概”
      半斤对八两
    某宰相的孙子，把家私都败光了，连饭也没得吃，常常向别人去借米。有一次，他又借到了一袋米，但背到半路上背不动了，只好在路边歇力。这时，前面走来一个破衣破裤的穷人，他就叫住那个人，讲定了工钱，为他背米。不料走了一段路，那人也气吁吁地走不动了。他就埋怨道：“我是宰相的孙子，手不能提，肩不能挑，乃是常事；你是穷人出身，为什么也是这样不中用？”
    那人也翻翻眼说：“你怎能怪我，我也是尚书的孙子呢！”
            ——出自“池北偶谈”
        树丫叉
    山乡人家，常用现成的树丫叉做凳脚。
    有一天，坏了这样的一只凳脚，父亲叫儿子到山林里去配一只。儿子拿了斧头出门，在山上转了一整天，结果还是空手而回。
    父亲问道：“你是怎么搞的？”
    儿子愁眉苦脸地回道：“树丫叉倒是多得很，却都是向上生的，可寻不到一个向下的！”
        满　意
    有人在路上遇到一个神仙。这神仙原来是他的老朋友。看他生活困难，便把路边的一块砖头一指，变成了金砖，送给他。他还不满意，神仙又把手一指，叫一尊大石狮变成金狮，一并送给他。可是他还嫌太少。
    神仙问他：“怎样你才满意呢？”
    这人支吾了一阵，说：“我想要你的这个手指！”
