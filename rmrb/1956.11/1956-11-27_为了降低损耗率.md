    "In Order to Reduce Loss Rate"
    Cheng Ji
    Some residents in Changchun City have reported that the goods they buy from cooperatives are short in weight. As a result, residents and salespersons often argue. Residents criticize the salespersons: "Why are you cheating people and giving short weight? Are you private merchants?"
    Does this mean that all the goods sold by cooperatives in Changchun City are short in weight? Of course not. However, it is true that some salespersons are giving short weight. It is understood that in the first five months of this year, the 94 grain supply stations in Changchun City sold more than 39,390 tons of grain, not only without any loss but with a surplus of 121 tons of grain. They sold 1,284 tons of soybean oil, also with a surplus of 9 tons. Everyone admits that when selling goods, there should be some reasonable loss. Now there is no loss at all, but a considerable surplus, which shows that there is a phenomenon of short weight when selling goods.
    Why does this happen? Some say: The scales are inaccurate, and errors are inevitable. Inaccurate scales will certainly cause errors of giving short or giving more. This kind of error should be prevented. The problem now is: Why do they only give short and never give more? Strangely enough, it is said that this is "in order to reduce the loss rate." To reduce the loss rate, efforts should be made to improve management methods and improve business capabilities, and the interests of the masses should never be harmed—by giving consumers short weight. Using the method of giving short weight to achieve the purpose of reducing the loss rate can be said to be a deceptive act.
    This matter cannot be entirely blamed on the salespersons. The salespersons firmly believe that doing so can "reduce losses for the country" and also meet the "requirements" of their superiors. In order to reduce losses, their superiors even formulated a "compensation" system. Whoever has more losses will have to compensate. Some salespersons have even compensated several kilograms of grain. The salespersons are afraid of compensating too much themselves and afraid of being criticized by their superiors, so they found the "trick" of "giving short weight," "creating" an amazing record of not only having no loss rate but also having a surplus of materials. Their superiors, seeing this record, praised it endlessly and even felt that "great achievements" had been made. Little do they know that behind this achievement lies a shameful secret.
    Now the grain supply department of Changchun City has discovered this mistake and is correcting it; however, some residents are still reporting that the goods sold by some cooperatives are short in weight. A good check should be made, and we should strive for real achievements, instead of pursuing superficial "achievements."

    “为了降低损耗率”
    成集
    长春市有些居民反映：从合作社买的东西，分量不足。因此，居民和售货员时有争吵。居民们批评售货员：“你们为什么欺骗人、少给分量？难道你们是私商吗？”
    是不是说长春市所有合作社卖出货物都少给一些呢？当然不是。但是，确有一些售货员少给了。据了解，今年长春市九十四个粮食供应站在五个月的时间里，销出三万九千三百九十多吨粮食，不但没有一点损耗，反而多出一百二十一吨粮食：销出一千二百八十四吨豆油，也多出九吨。谁都承认，卖东西，总要有一些合理的损耗。现在一点损耗也没有，反而剩余不少，可见是卖东西有分量不够的现象。
    为什么会发生这种现象呢？有人说：磅秤不准确，难免发生差错。磅秤不准确，固然会发生少给或多给的差错。这种差错，要注意防止。现在的问题是：为什么偏偏只少给不多给呢？说来奇怪，据说这是“为了降低损耗率”。降低损耗率，应该从改善经营管理方法、提高业务能力等方面去努力，决不应该损害群众利益——少给消费者东西。用少给一些的办法，来达到降低损耗率的目的，可以说是欺骗行为。
    这事也不能完全责怪售货员。售货员们满以为这样做法，可以“使国家少受些损失”，也可以满足上级的“要求”。为了要少损耗，他们的上级还曾经拟定了“包赔”的制度。谁要损耗多，谁就要包赔。有些售货员就曾经赔过几斤粮食。售货员们害怕自己多赔，又害怕上级批评，于是乎就找出了“少给分量”这个窍门，“创造”出了不但没有损耗率而且物资有了多余的惊人纪录。他们的上级看到这种纪录，赞扬不已，还觉得“成绩很大”。殊不知在这种成绩的背后隐藏着见不得人的丑事。
    现在长春市粮食供应部门已经发现这种错误，并且正在纠正中；但是，目前有些居民还在反映有些合作社卖出的东西分量不足。应该好好检查一下，为真正的成绩而奋斗，别再追求表面的“成绩”了。
