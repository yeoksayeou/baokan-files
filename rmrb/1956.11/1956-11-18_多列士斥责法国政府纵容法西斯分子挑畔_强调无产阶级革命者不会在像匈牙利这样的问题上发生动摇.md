Xinhua News Agency, November 16th, Paris dispatch: According to a TASS dispatch from Paris on November 16th: “L'Humanité” published an article by Maurice Thorez. The article emphasized that the French Communist Party resolutely opposes the shameless provocations of fascists connived at by the government led by the Socialists.

The author wrote: "Due to the Hungarian events, the bourgeois newspapers, radio stations, and films have launched an unrestrained propaganda campaign aimed at diverting attention from the Algerian war and the aggression against Egypt."

Thorez said: "The entire history of the Party teaches us that whenever the enemy launches such an offensive, we can always see two phenomena: on the one hand, the unity of our ranks, which even adds new strength to us, and on the other hand, the confusion and desertion of some weak and wavering elements."

He said that some people have shown wavering in the face of the offensive of reactionary forces, and these people are not good at combining the cause of the country with the cause of proletarian internationalism, as any Communist Party member should do.

He continued: "Anyone who wavers on issues like Hungary, even for a moment, is not a proletarian revolutionary. No matter what mistakes the leaders of the Hungarian Communist Party made in the past, no matter how urgently these mistakes need to be corrected; the working people understand that it is first necessary to defend the socialist achievements of the country and prevent counter-revolutionary encroachment, and therefore it is necessary to safeguard the party of the working class during this difficult period. Precisely for this reason, the French working people firmly support the Hungarian working people and firmly support the Soviet troops who responded to the demands of the Hungarian workers fighting against fascist aggression and went to help them."

Thorez emphasized that the French working class is determined to repel the conspiracies of the reactionaries, and pointed out that the working people are increasingly sympathetic to the Communist Party. He mentioned again that the unity of the Party must be protected like the apple of one's eye, because the unity and solidarity of the Party are necessary conditions for the victorious struggle for bread, peace, and freedom.

    多列士斥责法国政府纵容法西斯分子挑畔
    强调无产阶级革命者不会在像匈牙利这样的问题上发生动摇
    新华社16日讯　据塔斯社巴黎16日讯：法国“人道报”刊载了莫里斯·多列士的一篇文章。文章着重指出，法国共产党坚决反对在社会党人领导的政府纵容下的法西斯分子的无耻挑衅。
    作者写道：“由于发生了匈牙利事件，资产阶级报刊、电台和电影发动了放肆的宣传运动，其目的是为了转移对阿尔及利亚战争和对埃及的侵略的注意。”
    多列士说：“党的整个历史教导我们，在敌人发动这种进攻的时候，每次都可以看到两种现象：一方面是我们队伍的团结，甚至使我们增添了新的力量，另一方面是某些软弱和动摇分子的某种混乱和脱离队伍。”
    他说，某些人在反动势力的进攻面前表现了动摇，这些人不善于像任何共产党员应当做的那样，把国家的事业同无产阶级国际主义的事业结合起来。
    他接着说：“谁如果在像匈牙利这样的问题上发生动摇，即使是片刻的动摇，他就不是无产阶级革命者。不管匈牙利共产党的领导人在过去犯了怎样的错误，不管这些错误是如何迫切地需要纠正；劳动人民懂得，首先必须保卫这个国家的社会主义成果，防止反革命侵犯，因此就必须在这个困难的时期中维护工人阶级的政党。正因为这样，法国劳动人民坚决支持匈牙利劳动人民，坚决支持响应在为反对法西斯侵略而斗争的匈牙利工人的要求而去援助他们的苏联军队。”
    多列士着重指出，法国工人阶级有决心击退反动派的阴谋，并且指出，劳动人民日益同情共产党。他再次提到，必须像保护眼珠一样保护党的团结，因为党的统一和团结是胜利地为面包、和平和自由而斗争的必要条件。（附图片）
