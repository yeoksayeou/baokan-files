Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 1st. Budapest dispatch: The First Secretary of the Hungarian Working People's Party, Kadar, announced on October 30th that the "reorganization" of the Hungarian Working People's Party had begun.

According to Budapest Radio, Kadar said, "The purpose of this reorganization of the party is to completely eradicate past mistakes."

In a previous speech, Kadar said: For Communists, "they joined the party because of the promotion of human progress and socialist ideas, not for personal gain. They express our pure and correct ideas in a pure and correct way. Worker comrades, in recent years bad leadership has placed a heavy burden on our party. We should get rid of this burden with a pure conscience and a brave decision. The party ranks may waver, but I am not worried that honest, upright, and pure Communists will be disloyal to our ideals. Those who joined the party for personal gain, to find a job, or for other reasons will leave us. But after getting rid of this burden, getting rid of the burden of past sins, getting rid of some of our leaders, we will fight in the best and most complete conditions—but we should start from scratch—to safeguard our ideals, our people, our compatriots, and the happiness of our motherland. I ask every Communist to be an example to the people as an honest person and a Communist, to restore order and normal life, to start work and construction, to lay the foundation for the basic order of life, and thus be worthy of the respect of our compatriots."

    卡达尔宣布匈牙利劳动人民党开始改组
    新华社布拉格1日电　布达佩斯消息：匈牙利劳动人民党第一书记卡达尔10月30日宣布，匈牙利劳动人民党的“改组”已经开始。
    据布达佩斯电台广播，卡达尔说，“党的这次改组的目的在于彻底根除过去的错误”。
    在此之前的一次演讲中，卡达尔说：对共产党员来说，“他们入党是由于人类进步和社会主义思想的推动，而不是出于个人利益。他们用纯正而正确的方法来表达我们的纯正而正确的思想。工人同志们，最近这几年由于坏的领导把一个沉重的负担压在我们党的身上。我们应该以纯洁的良心，以勇敢的决定来摆脱这一重担。党的队伍可能会发生动摇，但我不担心诚实的、正直的、纯洁的共产党员会不忠实于我们的理想。那些为了个人利益、找职业或其他原因而入党的人会离开我们。但在摆脱了这一重担，摆脱了过去罪恶的重担，摆脱了我们的某些领导人之后，我们将在最好的最完全的条件下进行斗争——但应该从头开始——来维护我们的理想、我们的人民、我们的同胞和我们祖国的幸福。我要求每个共产党员作为正直的人和共产党员而成为人们的榜样，来恢复秩序和正常生活，来开始工作和建设，来为生活的基本秩序打下基础，从而当受我们同胞的尊敬而无愧。”
