Xinhua News Agency, November 25th, New York dispatch: The United Nations General Assembly has for the third time demanded that the United Kingdom, France, and Israel immediately withdraw their invading forces from Egypt. In the general debate on November 24th, the Assembly, with 63 votes in favor, 5 against, and 10 abstentions, passed the proposal formally submitted to the Assembly on November 23rd by the Afro-Asian group of nations, once again demanding that the United Kingdom, France, and Israel comply with UN resolutions and immediately withdraw their invading forces from Egypt.

The Afro-Asian group proposal finally adopted by the Assembly stated that the Assembly "notes with regret that, according to the information received by the Secretary-General, two-thirds of the French forces remain in place, all the United Kingdom forces are still there, despite the announcement of arrangements for the withdrawal of one battalion, and no Israeli forces have withdrawn behind the armistice line."

The proposal also charged the United Kingdom, France, and Israel to "comply immediately" with the previous resolutions requiring them to withdraw their troops, and requested UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld to promptly notify the parties concerned of its provisions and report to the Assembly "without delay" on their implementation.

This proposal was adopted based on an amendment proposed by Indian representative Menon to the original proposal. The amended proposal did not include Egypt, so the original twenty-one-nation proposal became a twenty-nation proposal. The purpose of the amendment was to garner more support. The original proposal was worded as follows: the Assembly "notes with great concern that, although a considerable time has elapsed since the Assembly requested compliance with the resolutions and the repeated resolutions for the immediate withdrawal of Israeli, French, and United Kingdom forces, it has still not been complied with."

The representatives who voted against the Afro-Asian group proposal were: Israel, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Australia, and France. Those who abstained were: Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, South Africa, Belgium, Canada, Kuomintang elements, Cuba, and the Dominican Republic. Nicaragua was absent.

The Assembly rejected an amendment proposed by the Belgian representative to the Afro-Asian group proposal with 23 votes in favor, 37 against, and 18 abstentions. This amendment advocated removing the words "with regret" from the Afro-Asian group proposal and merely stating that the Assembly noted the continued presence of foreign troops in Egypt.

Countries in favor of the Belgian amendment included the United Kingdom, France, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Italy, and Canada.

The Assembly also passed a proposal put forward by six countries: the United States, India, Canada, Yugoslavia, Norway, and Colombia. This proposal called for the approval of the reports submitted to the Assembly by UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld on the 21st regarding the organization and mission of the United Nations police force and the clearing of the Suez Canal, and advocated authorizing the Secretary-General to "undertake exploration of practical arrangements and agree on agreements for the rapid and effective conduct of clearing (the canal) work."

The six-nation proposal received 65 votes in favor, none against, and abstentions from the Soviet Union and Eastern European People's Democracies.

Greek representative Cassimatis, speaking first in yesterday's debate, said that the invading forces of the United Kingdom, France, and Israel "must withdraw immediately" from Egypt, and the Suez Canal issue "must be studied in accordance with Egypt's unconditional sovereignty over the canal." Before the withdrawal of foreign troops, no one can hope or demand that Egypt negotiate on the canal issue, nor can the clearing of the canal be carried out effectively.

Tunisian representative Bourguiba pointed out that the United Kingdom and France were attempting to use the situation created by their occupation of Egyptian territory to achieve some ulterior motive, that the United Kingdom and France were doing so to bring about a solution to the canal issue, and that Israel was doing so to resolve relations with its neighbors. He said, "We must restore the status quo so that the aggressors do not benefit from their acts of aggression." He also said that the United Kingdom should not be allowed to supply materials to the United Nations forces, as this would only create an excuse for them to remain there.

The representatives of France and the United Kingdom stubbornly opposed the Afro-Asian group proposal, saying that the presence of international forces should be a condition for the withdrawal of troops. The French representative also said that the priority was to clear the canal.

US representative Lodge also believed that the clearing of the canal was an urgent matter. He said that the work of the United Nations to clear the canal should begin immediately. Lodge said: "We do not agree to wait for the canal to be cleared before withdrawing foreign troops. At the same time, we do not think that starting to clear (the canal) should wait for the withdrawal to begin."

Lodge stated that, since the United Kingdom and France had announced plans to withdraw some of their troops, the United States considered the Afro-Asian proposal to be "unnecessary," although the United States still supported the amended Afro-Asian proposal and demanded that the six-nation proposal be passed.

Lodge's speech once again proves that the United States verbally supports the withdrawal of invading troops but in reality helps the aggressors' ruse aimed at delaying the withdrawal of troops.

Belgian representative Spaak tried his best to defend the United Kingdom, France, and Israel for their delay in withdrawing their invading troops, and he wanted to shield the three countries from condemnation by the Assembly. Spaak demanded that the Assembly pass a recommendation "that the aggressors can agree to," and he believed that the Belgian amendment was such a recommendation.

Indian representative Menon refuted the Belgian amendment. He said that the "purpose of this amendment is not to improve the original proposal, its obvious purpose is to invalidate the purpose of the original proposal."

Addressing the French representative's statement that some French troops had already been withdrawn, Menon asked, "Are French troops still on Egyptian territory?" He said that India "is at no time prepared to condone aggression against Egypt."

Representatives from Romania, Yugoslavia, Syria, Sudan, and Colombia also spoke in support of the Afro-Asian group proposal at the meeting on the 24th.

After voting on the three proposals, the Assembly adjourned and is scheduled to hold another plenary session on the 26th.

### 联合国大会通过亚非集团二十国提案  再次要求侵略军队立即撤出埃及  美国代表施展两面态度实际帮助了侵略者旨在拖延撤军的诡计

    联合国大会通过亚非集团二十国提案
    再次要求侵略军队立即撤出埃及
    美国代表施展两面态度实际帮助了侵略者旨在拖延撤军的诡计
    新华社25日讯　纽约消息：联合国大会第三次要求英、法和以色列三国立即从埃及撤退它们的侵略军队。在11月24日的一般辩论中，大会以六十三票赞成、五票反对和十票弃权的表决，通过了亚非集团国家23日正式向大会提出的再一次要求英、法、以色列三国遵守联合国决议，立即从埃及撤退它们的侵略军队的提案。
    大会最后通过的亚非集团提案说，大会“遗憾地注意到，根据秘书长得到的消息，三分之二的法国军队仍然未动，所有的联合王国部队都还留在那里，尽管曾经宣布过正在作撤退一个营的安排，并且没有任何以色列部队已撤到停战线以后”。
    这个提案还责成英国、法国和以色列“立即遵从”先前要求它们撤退军队的决议，并且要求联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德把它的条文迅速地通知有关方面，并“毫不拖延地”向大会报告它们的执行情况。
    这个提案是根据印度代表梅农对原提案提出的修正案通过的。修正后的提案没有埃及参加，所以原来的二十一国提案成为二十国提案。修正案的目的是争取更多的国家的支持。原提案的措词是，大会“非常忧虑地注意到，虽然大会要求遵守决议和以色列、法国和联合王国部队立即撤退的屡次的决议通过以后已经经过相当长的时间，但是仍然没有被遵守。”
    投票反对亚非集团提案的代表是：以色列、新西兰、联合王国、澳大利亚和法国。弃权的是：意大利、卢森堡、荷兰、葡萄牙、南非、比利时、加拿大、国民党分子、古巴和多米尼加共和国。尼加拉瓜缺席。
    大会以二十三票赞成、三十七票反对和十八票弃权否决了比利时代表对亚非集团提案提出的修正案。这项修正案主张取消亚非集团提案中的“遗憾地”的字样，而仅仅说大会注意到外国军队继续驻在埃及。
    赞成比利时修正案的有英国、法国、澳大利亚、新西兰、南非、意大利和加拿大等国家。
    大会还通过了美国、印度、加拿大、南斯拉夫、挪威和哥伦比亚六个国家提出的一项提案，这项提案要求批准联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德在21日就联合国警察部队的组织和任务问题和清理苏伊士运河问题向大会提出的报告，并且主张授权秘书长“着手探讨切实可行的安排、并商定协议，以便迅速有效地进行清理（运河的）工作”。
    赞成六国提案的有六十五票，没有人反对，苏联和东欧人民民主国家弃权。
    希腊代表卡西马蒂斯在昨天辩论中第一个发言。他说，英、法和以色列的侵略军队“必须立即撤出”埃及，苏伊士运河问题“必须根据埃及对运河的无条件的主权来加以研究”。在外国军队撤退以前，谁也不能希望或者要求埃及就运河问题进行谈判，清理运河的工作也不能有效地进行。
    突尼斯代表布尔吉巴发言指出，英、法企图利用它们占领埃及领土所造成的局势来达到某种不可告人的目的，英、法是为了导致运河问题的解决，以色列是为了解决同邻国的关系。他说，“我们必须恢复原状，使侵略者从他们的侵略行动中得不到好处”。他还说不应该允许英国以物资供应联合国部队，因为这只不过为他们留在那里造成借口。
    法国和英国的代表都顽固地反对亚非集团的提案，他们说要以国际部队的进驻情况作为撤退军队的条件。法国代表还说首要的是清理运河。
    美国代表洛奇也认为刻不容缓的事是清理运河。他说，由联合国清除运河的工作应该立即开始。洛奇说：“我们不同意要等待运河清理才撤退外国军队。同时我们也不认为开始清理（运河）要等撤退开始”。
    洛奇表示，由于英国和法国已经宣布撤退他们的部分军队的计划，美国认为亚非国家提案已经是“没有必要”了，虽然这样，美国仍然支持修正后的亚非提案，并且要求通过六国提案。
    洛奇的发言又一次证明，美国口头上支持撤退侵略军队的主张，实际却帮助侵略者的旨在拖延撤退军队的诡计。
    比利时代表斯巴克竭力替英、法和以色列迟迟不撤退它们的侵略军队辩解，他想使三国不受到大会的谴责。斯巴克要求大会通过一个为侵略者“所能够赞同的”建议，他认为比利时的修正案就是这样一个建议。
    印度代表梅农驳斥比利时的修正案。他说，这个“修正案的目的不是使原提案更完善，它的明显目的是使原提案的目的归于无效”。
    梅农针对法国代表发表的已经撤退一部分法国军队的说法问道，法国军队“是不是仍然在埃及的领土上？”他说，印度“在任何时候都不准备宽容对埃及的侵略”。
    在24日会议上发言支持亚非集团提案的还有罗马尼亚、南斯拉夫、叙利亚、苏丹和哥伦比亚等国家的代表。
    大会对三个提案进行表决以后休会，并且定于26日再举行全体会议。
