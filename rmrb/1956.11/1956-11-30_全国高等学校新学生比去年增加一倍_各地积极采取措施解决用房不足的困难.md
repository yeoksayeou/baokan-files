Xinhua News Agency, November 29th. Xinhua News Agency reporter Zhang Lijun reports: This year, national colleges and universities have enrolled nearly twice as many new students as last year, but the schools' basic construction has not been completed on time. As a result, many colleges and universities are experiencing a tense situation of insufficient learning and living space. The Ministry of Higher Education and relevant departments are actively taking measures to solve this problem after repeated studies.

Beijing's colleges and universities, which have increased their new student intake by more than 17,000, are experiencing the most acute housing shortage. Beijing's colleges and universities have developed from thirteen at the time of liberation to thirty-one this year, and the scale and speed of basic construction in recent years has been unprecedented. However, the teaching and living space of the schools is still insufficient. Of the nineteen colleges and universities (excluding higher normal schools) with basic construction tasks this year, only 16.8% of the originally planned 230,000+ square meters of construction area was completed before the start of school. As a result, student dormitories in many schools are very crowded, faculty and staff housing is insufficient, and many schools have to implement a two-shift system for classes and meals. After studying this situation, relevant departments, despite the extreme shortage of building materials, the State Economic Commission managed to allocate a batch of building materials such as timber, steel, cement, and pig iron to support school construction projects. The Ministry of Petroleum Industry, the Ministry of Coal Industry, the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry and other departments have assisted in solving the building material problems of Beijing Petroleum Institute and other colleges and universities under their management. The Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China has also vigorously mobilized construction forces for the basic construction projects of colleges and universities. So far, all of the original basic construction tasks have started, except for individual projects, and more than 75,000 square meters of construction area have been completed.

While accelerating basic construction, the administrative departments of Beijing's colleges and universities have rationally allocated and adjusted existing buildings, appropriately reduced office space, and made full use of various temporary buildings. The Beijing Institute of Geology has adjusted some general course classrooms to serve as student dormitories. At the Beijing University of Political Science and Law, under the leadership of the vice president (the president does not live on campus), the secretary of the CCP committee, and the director of general affairs, a dormitory building was vacated for students to live in. The tense situation of learning and living space has gradually eased.

Recently, the Ministry of Higher Education has reported to the State Council for approval, and has added a portion of construction area to several colleges and universities in Beijing that are still facing housing shortages after completing this year's basic construction tasks. Among them, five schools have added a total of 14,800 square meters of construction area, and these projects have been arranged to start by Beijing.

In some colleges and universities in Shanghai, Xi'an, Lanzhou, Wuhan, and other places, there is also a certain degree of housing shortage due to insufficient building materials and construction forces. Local Party and government leading departments and schools are working to solve the problem.

With the development of higher education, the state's investment in basic construction of colleges and universities is very large. Since liberation, the area of newly built and expanded colleges and universities has reached more than 6.63 million square meters (including higher normal schools), which is 1.79 times larger than the area built in the fifty years before liberation. Even so, it still cannot fully meet the needs of the rapid growth of students in various schools. According to the annual basic construction tasks, the living space for teachers and students is still quite tense. According to statistics from 138 colleges and universities across the country, 800,000 square meters of dormitories need to be built just to solve the housing problem for faculty and staff and improve the living conditions of some teachers. At a time when the country is concentrating its efforts on heavy industry construction, this number is obviously difficult to solve all at once. However, the current difficulty of insufficient school buildings in colleges and universities is only a difficulty in progress. In recent years, faculty, staff, and students of colleges and universities have adopted revolutionary methods to tap potential to overcome it.

Currently, on the one hand, colleges and universities are facing a tense situation of housing, and on the other hand, there are also wasteful phenomena in the basic construction of some colleges and universities, and the utilization rate of existing teaching space has not been fully utilized. The new kitchen built by Fudan University has a full set of mechanized equipment, which can fully supply meals for 10,000 people, while the school's maximum development scale is initially planned for only 5,000 people. The dining hall built by Shanghai Foreign Language Institute is similar to an auditorium and is very expensive. This kind of practice that deviates from the fine tradition of hard work and simplicity must be resolutely opposed.

### 全国高等学校新学生比去年增加一倍  各地积极采取措施解决用房不足的困难

    全国高等学校新学生比去年增加一倍
    各地积极采取措施解决用房不足的困难
    新华社29日讯　新华社记者张丽君报道：今年全国高等学校比去年多招收了近一倍的新生，但是学校的基本建设却没有按时完工。这样，在许多高等学校中就出现了学习和生活用房不足的紧张情况。高等教育部和有关部门经过多次研究，正在积极采取措施加以解决。
    增加新生一万七千多人的北京市各高等学校，用房的紧张情况最突出。北京市高等学校由刚解放时的十三所发展到今年的三十一所，几年来基本建设的规模和速度也是空前的。但是学校的教学用房和生活用房还是不够用。今年有基本建设任务的十九所高等学校（不包括高等师范），由于原计划二十三万多平方公尺建筑面积开学前只完工16.8％，所以很多学校学生宿舍很拥挤，教职员工宿舍不够分配，有不少学校上课，吃饭都是实行二部制。有关部门研究了这种情况以后，目前虽然建筑材料十分缺乏，国家经济委员会还是设法调拨出一批木材、钢材、水泥、生铁等建筑材料来支援学校建筑工程。石油工业部、煤炭工业部、邮电部、冶金工业部等部门都协助解决所管理的北京石油学院等高等学校的建筑材料问题。中共北京市委员会也为高等学校的基本建设工程大力调集了施工力量。到目前为止，原定的基本建设任务除个别工程项目以外，已经全部开工，而且有七万五千多平方公尺建筑面积已经完工。
    在加紧基本建设的同时，北京市各高等学校行政方面合理地分配和调整了现有的房屋，适当地紧缩办公室，充分利用各种临时性建筑。北京地质学院把部分普通课教室调整出来作学生宿舍。北京政法学院在副院长（院长不住在校内）、中共党委书记和总务主任的带头下，腾出一幢宿舍大楼给学生住。学习和生活用房的紧张局面已经逐步缓和。
    最近高等教育部已经报请国务院批准，对于在完成今年基本建设任务以后用房仍然紧张的北京市几所高等学校，另外追加了一部分建筑面积。其中有五所学校共追加了一万四千八百平方公尺建筑面积，这些工程已经由北京市安排开工。
    上海、西安、兰州、武汉等地部分高等学校，由于建筑材料和施工力量不足，也存在着一定程度的用房紧张情况。各地党和政府领导部门以及学校正在设法解决中。
    随着高等教育事业的发展，国家对高等学校基本建设的投资是很大的。解放以来新建和扩建的高等学校面积达到六百六十三万多平方公尺（包括高等师范），比解放以前五十多年所建的面积还大一点七九倍。即使如此，也还不能完全适应各校学生迅速增长的需要。各校按照每年基本建设任务完成以后，教师和学生的生活用房情况仍然是相当紧张的。据全国一百三十八所高等学校的统计，单是为了解决教职员的住宿问题和改善部分教师的住宿条件就需要盖八十万平方公尺面积的宿舍。在当前国家集中力量进行重工业建设的时候，这个数字显然是很难一下子解决的。不过，高等学校目前存在的校舍不足的困难，只是前进中的困难。几年来，高等学校的教职员工和学生都采取革命办法挖掘潜力来加以克服。
    当前，一方面是高等学校存在着住宿用房紧张的情况，另一方面也有部分高等学校的基本建设有浪费现象，同时现有的教学用房利用率也没有充分发挥。复旦大学新盖的厨房，有全套机械化设备，充分利用可以供应一万人用饭，而学校的最大发展规模初步预定只五千人。上海外国语学院修建的饭厅类似礼堂，造价很高。这种离开了艰苦朴素的优良传统的做法是要坚决反对的。
