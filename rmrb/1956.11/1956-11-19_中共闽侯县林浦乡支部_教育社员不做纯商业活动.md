Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 16th. After Minhou County in Fujian Province opened up free markets, more than 60 commune members from various agricultural cooperatives in Linpu Township left agricultural production to engage in businesses such as selling sweet potatoes, potatoes, fresh fish, and live pigs. These purely commercial activities affected other commune members' peace of mind in agricultural production.

At the beginning of November, the CCP branch in this township, through various meetings, publicized the policy of farmer trade, explained the boundaries between commerce and sideline production, and analyzed the adverse effects of commune members doing business on the consolidation of agricultural cooperatives. At the same time, they actively helped commune members find legitimate sideline production avenues locally, guiding commune members engaged in business to do sideline production such as weaving rattan mats, digging up clam shells, and transporting goods. More than 140 commune members from Linpu Agricultural Cooperative in this township earned more than 200 yuan a day after doing these sideline productions, with an average income of about 1.5 yuan per person per day, which was much better than selling things.

Now, these more than 60 commune members engaged in business understand the principle that engaging in purely commercial activities is detrimental to consolidating agricultural cooperatives. Having legitimate sideline production, they no longer engage in purely commercial activities.

### 中共闽侯县林浦乡支部  教育社员不做纯商业活动

    中共闽侯县林浦乡支部
    教育社员不做纯商业活动
    新华社福州16日电　福建省闽侯县开放自由市场以后，林浦乡的各个农业社曾经有六十多个社员脱离了农业生产去做贩卖蕃薯、马铃薯、鲜鱼、生猪等生意。他们的这些纯商业活动，影响了其他社员安心于农业生产。
    11月初，这个乡的中共支部通过各种会议宣传农民贸易政策，说明商业和副业生产的界限，并分析了社员经商对巩固农业社等不良影响，同时积极帮助社员就地寻找正当的副业生产门路，指导经商的社员去做编藤席、扒蚬壳、搬运等副业生产。这个乡的林浦农业社的一百四十多个社员，做这些副业生产后，一天就能收入二百多元，平均每人一天可收入一元五角左右，比去贩卖东西好得多。
    现在这六十多个经商的社员了解了搞纯商业对巩固农业社不利的道理，又有正当的副业生产以后，都不再做纯商业活动了。
