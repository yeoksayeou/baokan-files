Strolling Through the Book Forest

　　Talking About Organizing Books

　　The most distressing thing is finding books. I often say that if you have a book but can't find it, it's better to borrow it from the library. But when it comes to the "books" in the library, there are so many things to talk about that I don't know where to start. Finding "books" in the library is not easy either! Some friends who donated books to the Beijing Library want to use them themselves, but when they go back to borrow them, they can't "find" them anymore. One person in charge of ordinary books said to Mr. Zhao Wanli: "You should try your best to select books for the rare book section, considering it as rescuing them. Here, they are 'lost at the bottom of the sea, and no one knows when they will see the light of day again.'" Indeed, boxes, bundles, and packages of books are stored in batches here and there, and sometimes they are moved east or west like mice moving their homes. There are as many as 1.8 million books that cannot be organized, cataloged, and made available to readers and researchers. Among them, there are not only ancient Chinese books, nor are they all duplicates of "Imperial Edicts with Vermilion Endorsements." There are very important books that are currently needed, including some new Russian books. A foreign expert visited the Beijing Library and asked:
　　"How many books do you have in your library?"
　　"Around four million," the librarian replied.
　　"How many of them are already on the shelves? How many have been organized, cataloged, and are available for readers to borrow?"
　　The librarian replied: "More than 2.2 million have been shelved, organized, and cataloged, and are available for readers to borrow. The remaining 1.8 million have not been organized yet."
　　"Then," the expert said, "the number of books in your library can only be said to be 2.2 million, not 4 million."
　　This is a very sharp criticism and a very correct opinion. Books that cannot be circulated are indeed difficult to count in the library's collection. What's even worse is that some books, because they have been stored in boxes for a long time, unseen for more than ten years, are occasionally opened and found to have crumbled into paper scraps, impossible to salvage. What a great loss this is!
　　Efforts have been made several times: "We must organize!" Even now, efforts are being made! A few years ago, to organize less than 100,000 Russian books, many people were mobilized. But those efforts were only intermittent, sometimes tight and sometimes loose. In short, the effort was not great, and there was no thorough solution. The main reason is that there is no place for them to organize. Even if they are gradually organized, there is no way to put them on the shelves.
　　Is it impossible to solve this difficulty forever? No! It should be possible to solve, and it could have been solved, but a sudden obstacle arose, a sudden change of plan, making a solvable difficulty unsolvable again. Originally, in the Beijing municipal plan, the Wenjin Street area was designated as the Beijing Library area. This was personally agreed upon with several mayors of Beijing. The first thing that was agreed upon was that after the tuberculosis sanatorium in Beihai Park was moved out, it would be given to the Beijing Library for use. This sanatorium has a considerable area, with more than 200 rooms. Although it cannot completely solve the problems of the Beijing Library, these 200 rooms can solve the current difficulties. At some point, supposedly after a decision by a mayor's office meeting, the sanatorium was allocated to Beihai Park for its own use. I don't know what Beihai Park needs these 200 rooms for. The decision of the mayor's office meeting is not necessarily "law," and it can be discussed and changed again. If the Beijing Library can play a greater role and serve scientists better and more extensively, it will also be a glory for Beijing, and there is no contradiction between the two. I hope they can maintain the original plan. The key to China's second five-year plan lies in the progress of scientific research. And one of the foundations for carrying out scientific research is the library. The Beijing Library is China's only and largest national library. It must overcome all difficulties and make all the more than four million books in its collection available to scientists and other experts.
　　I have talked more about the Beijing Library because I am more familiar with it and have a special affection for it. "All crows are black." When we look at the libraries in the world, how many can fully play their due role and fulfill their responsibility to serve science? Not a few are lifeless and dark (referring to the lack of sunlight). Xi'an is such an important place, but what does its library look like? They told me that there are very few new books, even fewer foreign books, and the funding for buying books is pitifully small. How can it serve the scientific research of the new and great Xi'an? Even the existing dusty ancient books have not been sorted out yet. I once reflected their opinions. I don't know if there has been any improvement in the past year.

    谈整书
    最苦恼的是找书。我常常说，如果有书而找不到，还不如到图书馆去借更方便些。但说起图书馆里的“书”来，实在是千头万绪，不知从何谈起好。图书馆里的“书”，找起来又何尝是容易的事！有些朋友把图书捐给北京图书馆之后，自己要用，再去借，却再也“找”不到了。有一位管普通书的人对赵万里先生说：“你们尽量把书挑选到善本部去吧，算是救出了它们。在我们这里是“冤沉海底，不知何年何月才得重见天日”。的确，一箱箱，一捆捆，一包包的书，东藏一批，西放一批，有时还要像老鼠搬家似的被赶到东，或被迁到西。足足有一百八十万册的图书，没法整理、编目，与读者们见面，供研究者们使用。其中，不完全是中文古书，也不完全是复本的“朱批谕旨”之类，尽有很重要的，现在正在需要的图书，甚至包括若干新的俄文书籍在内。有一位外国专家到北京图书馆参观，问道：
    “你们馆里藏了多少册书？”
    “有四百万册上下”，馆长答道。
    “有多少册已经上架了呢？有多少册已经整理、编目，可供读者们阅读的呢？”
    馆长答道：“有二百二十多万册已经上架，已经整理、编目，可供读者们的借阅，其余一百八十万册还没法整理。”
    “那末”，那位专家说道，“你馆的藏书数量，只能说是二百二十万册，不能说，是四百万册”。
    这是很尖锐的批评，也是很正确的意见。不能流通使用的书，的确难于统计到图书馆的藏书数里去的。更惨的是，有的书，因为长久搁在箱里，十多年不见天日，有一次偶然开出几箱出来看看，箱里的书却已经碎成纸屑，没法收拾的了。这是多么大的损失呢！
    也曾作过几次的努力：“要整理！”就是现在，也正在努力整理！前几年，为了整理十万册不到的俄文书，还曾动员了不少人。但那些努力只是断断续续地，有时松时紧之感。总之是，劲头不大，没有彻底解决的办法。主要的原因是没有地方供给他们整理，即使陆续整理出来了，也没法上架。
    是不是永远没法解决这个困难？不是的！应该可以解决，而且本来已经可以解决的了，而突然的阻碍横生，忽有变卦，致使可以解决的困难，又成了不可解决的。原来在北京市政规划里，文津街一带是划作北京图书馆区的，这是我亲自和北京市几位市长们谈定的。首先说定的是，北海里的肺病疗养院迁出后，即归北京图书馆使用。这个疗养院面积不少，有二百多间房子，虽不能全部解决北京图书馆的问题，但对于目前的困难，得此二百多间房子是可以解决的。不知什么时候，据说是，经过一次市长办公会议的决定，这个疗养院的房子便划归北海公园自用了。我不知道北海公园要这二百多间房子何用。市长办公会议的决定未必便是“法律”，尽可以再议再变的。北京图书馆如能发挥更大的作用，能够更好地、更多地为科学家们服务，也便是北京市的一个光荣，其间并无矛盾之处。我希望他们能够维持原定计划才好。我国第二个五年计划，其关键性所在是科学研究的进展。而科学研究工作的进行，其基础之一是图书馆。北京图书馆乃是中国唯一的最大的国立图书馆，必须克服一切困难，使库藏的四百多万册书都能为科学家们和其他专家们使用才好。
    以上多谈了些北京图书馆的事，那是因为我对它比较熟悉，且特别有感情之故。“天下老鸦一般黑”。我们看看天下的图书馆，能够充分地发挥其应有的作用的，能够尽了为科学服务的责任的到底有几个？死气沉沉，暗无天日（指没有阳光而言）的不在少数。西安市是一个那末重要的地方，但其图书馆是何等样子呢！他们和我谈过，新书少极了，外文书更少，购书的费用少得可怜。如何能够尽其为新的大西安市的科学研究服务呢？即旧有的尘封的古书，也有许多还没有整理出来。我曾经把他们的意见反映过，不知这一年来有没有改进。
