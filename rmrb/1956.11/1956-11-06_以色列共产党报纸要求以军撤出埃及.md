    Xinhua News Agency, Tel Aviv, 5th dispatch from TASS: The Israeli Communist Party's organ, "People's Voice," in an editorial, severely condemned Israel's military adventure against Egypt and called on the public to demand that Israeli troops immediately cease fire and withdraw from Egyptian territory.
    The newspaper pointed out that the United Nations had passed a resolution on an immediate ceasefire in Egypt, which was voted for by almost all UN member states. The Ben-Gurion government's grave steps have set Israel against almost the entire world. To ensure its own security, Israel needs not new territory, but agreements and peaceful coexistence with its neighbors. Military actions and military aggression will only prevent us from obtaining peace.

    以色列共产党报纸要求以军撤出埃及
    新华社5日讯　塔斯社特拉维夫五日讯：以色列共产党机关报“人民呼声报”在社论中严厉指责以色列对埃及发动的军事冒险，并且号召公众要求以色列军队立即停火和撤出埃及领土。
    报纸指出，联合国通过了几乎是全体联合国会员国都投票赞成的关于立即在埃及停火的决议。本—古里安政府所采取的后果严重的步骤，把以色列同几乎是全世界的人对立起来。以色列为了确保自己的安全，需要的不是新的领土，而是同邻国达成协议和和平相处。要知道，军事行动和军事侵略只会使我们得不到和平。
