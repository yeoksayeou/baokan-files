    The Westbound Train
    Hong Liu
    At midnight, the tall buildings near the Lanzhou East Railway Station spewed out dense, dazzling lights, and the night breeze carried a refreshing floral fragrance. A long passenger train heading west stopped at the platform, and the passengers stood in groups of twos and threes, reluctant to leave the night scene of Lanzhou. An old Tibetan man squinted at the train for a while, then turned back to look at the electric lights coming from the tall buildings. He touched his head in bewilderment and said to his companion, "Ah! Everywhere is flashing with lights, it's really like being in heaven!" I couldn't help but turn back to look at this charming Lanzhou, thinking in my heart, "In this East Railway Station, there wasn't even a single household before..."
    When we boarded the spacious carriage, the wall lamps inside were already lit. The train started moving west, and many passengers rushed to sit by the windows to see how the ancient city of Lanzhou, with its two thousand years of history, was being filled with huge, new buildings. As the train slowly passed through the several-mile-long Chengdong Railway New Village, we arrived at the famous scenic spot of Wuquan Mountain, and then to the Lanzhou West Railway Station, which has a huge freight handling capacity. Further west, the pipeline project of the huge Lanzhou Refinery has already begun on a large scale. In the future, the rich crude oil produced in the Northwest will be transported here by train for refining. Look, the oil storage tanks are being built densely.
    When the train was about to reach the Hekou Yellow River Iron Bridge, the speed of the train slowed down, the Yellow River roared, foaming and surging with waves, one wave pushing another. This couldn't help but remind me of the past. The selfless laboring figures of engineers, technicians, and workers appeared before my eyes. I seemed to see a young engineer holding a "Zhuge Liang meeting" with the workers. He was an engineer who followed the mass line and was careful and bold. In a flood rescue, he and the outstanding bridge workers ran ahead of time. That time, the flood suddenly hit a pier that was about to sink, and the temporary bridge was about to be washed away. Once the temporary bridge was broken, the workers' return route would be cut off, and the risk was not small. But he led the workers to repair the temporary bridge, inspected the steel cables, replaced the more efficient water pump, reinforced the steel sheet piles, and added a special person to manage the red and green light safety signals. In this way, the engineer and experienced workers jointly researched a bold and correct approach: "Ensure safety, and strive to persist for one more minute if possible!" As a result, they fought the flood for more than a month and finally made the pier safely sink to the bottom.
    Yellow River's滔滔 (Tao Tao) mighty waves, why do you not cease for so long? Could it be that you are also praising the achievements of these heroes?
    The train is very lively, just like a big family. People who often take the train will meet many acquaintances; even if they don't know each other, as long as they start a few words, they will have endless conversations and laughter. Today, the passengers on this train can be roughly divided into several categories: one hundred and fifty to sixty students from the Beijing Petroleum Institute going to the Yumen Oilfield for internships; hundreds of male and female commercial workers transferred from Shanghai to emerging cities in the Hexi Corridor to serve; hundreds of railway engineering school students going to the Jiayuguan mechanical road construction team for internships; many Uyghur, Hui, and Han passengers going to Xinjiang; members of agricultural cooperatives and railway workers and their families along the route, as well as playwrights, artists, singers, journalists... It can really be said to be a microcosm of society. In the train, there are beautiful restaurants, children's cars, sleeping cars, and passenger get-togethers are often organized. And this happy traveling family is traveling in the embrace of the beautiful rivers and mountains of the motherland. The legend of Qilian Mountain, this treasure mountain, is endless, and the new constructions along the route constantly give people new and fascinating allure, making these long-distance travelers not feel tired at all!
    The train is heading towards "Golden Zhangye". I talked with a very talkative local old man. This is a happy old man with a long, grizzled beard, wearing a white Hui cloth hat, twisting his beard, the more he talked, the more energetic he became: "The Hexi Corridor is the granary of Gansu, and the Qilian Mountains are the treasure trove shared by all ethnic groups in the Northwest, but in the past—" He sighed long, looked at the crops and newly planted small trees on the farmland passing by outside the window, and said with emotion, "In the past, no one in the Hexi Corridor was in the mood to farm well. The ruling class instigated us to kill each other between ethnic groups, and farming was also abandoned, let alone going to the Qilian Mountains to explore for treasure—alas, no wonder the ancients used 'Yellow dust covers the past and present, white bones scattered among the weeds' to describe this battlefield. Here, since the establishment of the four counties of Wuwei, Zhangye, Jiuquan, and Dunhuang in the Han Dynasty, it has become a major thoroughfare for trade between China and foreign countries, but the ethnic disputes have never been resolved. This trade route has also been intermittent. Only today, thousands of years later, has the Communist Party united our ethnic groups into a large family, and the Hexi Corridor—er, it should be said that the ethnic disputes in the entire Northwest region have been completely resolved."
    At this time, several young people wearing Hui hats were having a get-together with Han students from the railway engineering school. A Hui youth named Ma Zhansheng was singing loudly.
    Outside the window, it was no longer the Wushaoling Mountains. The ripe wheat in the fields was swaying in the wind, and the atmosphere of a bumper harvest year was so enticing. In the train car, Wang Lianyu, an intern from the railway engineering school, still couldn't forget the magnificent scene of the train winding up the Wushaoling Mountains at an altitude of three thousand meters. He opened his notebook and softly recited a song he wrote when he passed Wushaoling:
    Wushaoling is high and high,
    White clouds come to wrap the mountain top;
    Snowy peaks inserted into the clouds,
    The railway winds around the mountainside.
    From the adjacent car, there was a lot of applause from the passengers, and the singing of a soprano came over here. I gently walked to the adjacent car. There, one hundred and dozens of petroleum institute students, female actors from the Yumen Mine Cultural Troupe who had returned from Beijing after learning singing and dancing, the author of the drama "Steel Transport Soldier", etc., were having a get-together. This meeting was really lively, and people seemed a little crowded, but everyone was attracted by the singing, and they also forgot about the crowding, and also made way for the female dancer to perform simple dances. Outside the window, it began to rain lightly, and the sound of raindrops falling on the window glass seemed to be lightly beating the rhythm for the dancer. ...
    After this evening party, I walked back to my car and chatted with a surveyor again. He told a touching story from when he surveyed the Lanzhou-Xinjiang line in 1953. That time, a group of surveyors walked into the waterless Gobi desert. The Gobi desert was endless, and the water in everyone's kettles had been drunk. Some people had already secretly started drinking their own urine. At this time, a Communist Youth League member went out to find a spring. Suddenly, he found a place that was a little damp, so he used his fingers to dig open the pebbles. His fingers were worn and bleeding, but he finally dug out some water. But there was very little water, so he could only use his mouth to suck the water. He lay down and used his mouth to suck, sucking a mouthful and pouring a mouthful of water into the kettle. After filling a kettle, his joints were sore and numb, but he took this kettle of water back and first gave it to the technicians to drink, and to other people to drink. He only drank a little at the very end. I heard this story in 1953, but listening to it again now, it still excites me so powerfully. My travel companion continued: "We people who regard the barren mountains and wild ridges as our home also have a kind of happiness that others cannot enjoy. We arrive at many places that others have not been to first. We see a white, shining expanse in front of us, which looks like a beautiful heavenly lake from afar! After a few people discussed it, they named this place Tianhu Station on the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Line. The names we gave to the stations in the wilderness and Gobi deserts are very beautiful. In fact, as soon as the train reaches there, construction follows there, and even the construction is more beautiful than the names we originally gave—"
    At this time, someone chimed in and said, "Look, Zhangye is almost here."
    Zhangye, people have long said that in the future, this "better than Jiangnan"
    "The area outside the Great Wall south of the Yangtze River" will be built even more beautiful than Jiangnan. Here, tall trees reach the sky, paddy fields stretch endlessly, and the Heihe River system provides it with a constant supply of water. Some people say that the Heihe River system has a flow of 153,000 cubic meters, and in the future, rice fields can be greatly developed in this area. It also produces apples, pears, peaches, and grapes. When our southern workers were building roads here, they really felt like they were in their hometown of Jiangnan!
    The train sped westward, passing Qingshui and Jiuquan, passing the Hongshuihe Bridge built by the staff with saved materials. Further ahead, the Gobi desert stretched one after another. When I walked from the soft sleeper car to the last section of the train, the official observation car, three sides of the car were glass. Looking out over the new line on the endless Gobi desert from the large glass windows, I saw the Beidahe Bridge, which the staff had struggled with ice blocks to build, gradually revealing its bridge body.
    Soon, the train approached Jiayuguan, the end of the Great Wall. The people sitting in the car could clearly see the majestic posture of the tall gate tower. As soon as we left the pass, we could see the oil drilling derricks one after another. This is very different from the scene described by the ancient poets: "Once you leave Jiayuguan, tears will never dry. Looking forward, the great Gobi desert. Looking back, the gate of hell!"
    The train left Jiayuguan, passed Baiyanghe Station, and drove into the south station of Yumen, the oil capital. "We're at Yumen South Station!" someone shouted. We excitedly walked out of the car. Here, a large number of road construction workers are preparing to continue westward. The ancient poems "No old friends west of Yangguan" and "The spring breeze does not pass Yumen Pass" have been rewritten by the historical pen of the new era as "A sea of red west of Yangguan" and "The spring breeze universally benefits Yumen Pass"!

    列车西去
    洪流
    午夜，兰州东火车站附近的高楼大厦上吐出密密的耀眼的灯光，一阵阵夜风送来清新的花香。一列西去的长长的旅客列车停在站台上，旅客们三五成群地站在月台上，留恋着兰州的夜景。一位藏族老大爷眯着眼望了会火车，又回转头瞧瞧高楼大厦上吐出来的电灯光，用手摸摸自己的脑袋，迷惑地向他的伙伴说：“啊！到处都是闪闪的灯光，真像是上了天堂！”我也情不自禁地回转头来瞧瞧这迷人的兰州，心里在想着：“在这东火车站，从前是连一户人家也没有的呀……”
    当我们登上宽畅的车厢，车厢里的壁灯早亮了。列车向西开动，不少旅客都争先坐到窗口，去看那有两千年历史的古老的兰州城，是怎样被巨大的、新的建筑充实起来。当火车徐徐地驶过有数里长的城东铁路新村，就到了著名的风景区五泉山，接着又来到有巨大货运吞吐力量的兰州西火车站，再往西，巨大的兰州炼油厂的管线工程已经大规模开始了，将来，西北出产的丰富的原油都要由火车把它们运到这里来提炼。你瞧，一个个储油罐密密地修建起来。
    火车快驶到河口黄河大铁桥时，车行速度缓慢下来，黄河的水咆哮着，冒着白沫，涌着水浪，浪花一个推送着一个。这不禁使我想起往事来。一个个工程师、技术员、工人的忘我劳动的形象浮现在我底眼前，我仿佛看见一个年青的工程师正在和工人开“诸葛亮会议”。那是一个走群众路线而又细心大胆的工程师，在一次抢救洪水中，他和那批出色的桥梁工人们跑在时间前面了。那次，洪水突然冲击着一个快要落底的桥墩，便桥也快要被冲垮了，便桥一断，工人的归路也断了，风险是真不小啊。可是他领导工人修理了便桥，检查了钢索，换上效力更高的抽水机，加固了钢板椿，并添设专人专管红绿灯安全信号，这样，工程师和有经验的工人共同研究出一条大胆而正确的方针：“保证安全，能够争取多坚持一分钟的一定要争取！”结果，同洪水战斗了一个多月，终于使桥墩安全地落底了。
    黄河的滔滔的巨浪声，你为什么久久不息？莫非你也在赞美这些英雄们的业迹？
    列车里热闹得很，真像一个大家庭一样。经常坐火车的人，会遇到许多熟人；就是不认识的，只要开头拉几句，跟着就会有说有笑地拉不完。今天这列火车里的旅客大致可分几类：一百五六十名北京石油学院学生去玉门油矿实习；百几十个从上海调到河西走廊新兴城市去服务的男女商业工作者；上百个铁路工程学校学生到嘉峪关外机械筑路队去实习；许多到新疆去的维吾尔族、回族、汉族的旅客；沿线农业合作社的社员和铁路工人和他们的家属，还有剧作家、美术家、歌唱家、新闻记者……真能说得上是一个社会的缩影。在列车里，有漂亮的餐厅，有儿童车，卧车，也经常组织列车旅客联欢会。而这个愉快的旅行大家庭又是行驶在祖国的美丽河山的怀抱里，祁连山这座百宝山里的神话说不完，沿线新建设又不断给人新的迷人的诱力，使这些千里长途的旅行家们一点也不感到疲倦！
    火车正在向“金张掖”驶去，我同一个谈锋很健的本地老人交谈上了。这是个留有长长花白胡须的快乐老人，头上戴一顶回族的白布帽子，手指捻捻胡须愈谈愈有精神了：“河西走廊是甘肃的米粮仓，祁连山又是西北各民族共有的聚宝盆，可是在过去——”他长长地叹了口气，望了望窗外飞驶而过的农田上的庄稼和新植的小树，颇有感触地说：“过去，河西走廊谁也没心思好好务庄稼，统治阶级挑拨我们民族间互相残杀，农事也废弃了，更谈不到进祁连山去探宝——唉，难怪古人要用‘黄尘足今古，白骨乱蓬蒿’来形容这一带的战场了。这里，自汉朝建立了武威、张掖、酒泉、敦煌四郡，就成了中外通商大道，可是民族纠纷一直没有解决。这通商大道也是时断时续，只有几千年后的今天，共产党把我们各民族团结成一个大家庭，河西走廊——呃，应该说是全西北地区的民族纠纷问题才彻底解决了。”
    这时候，几个年青的戴回族帽子的人正在和铁路工程学校的汉族学生联欢，一个名叫马占胜的回族青年在引嗓高歌。
    窗外，早已经不是乌鞘岭了。农田里熟透了的小麦在随风摇摆，那大丰收年的气象是多么诱人。车窗里，铁路工程学校的实习生王廉玉对火车在拔海三千公尺的乌鞘岭盘旋而上的壮景还难以忘却，他翻开笔记本，低声地吟着他过乌鞘岭时新创作的一首歌词：
    乌鞘岭高又高，
    白云来把山头包；
    白雪山峰插云霄，
    铁路环绕在山腰。
    从相邻的车厢里，透过来许多旅客的掌声，一个女高音的歌唱声送过这边来。我轻轻地走到相邻的车厢去。那里，一百几十个石油学院的学生、玉门矿文工队去北京学习歌舞回来的女演员，话剧“钢铁运输兵”的作者等在一起开联欢会呢。这个会真热闹，人显得有点拥挤，可是大家全被歌声吸引了，也忘记了挤，并且还让出一条路来，让女舞蹈家表演简单的舞蹈。车窗外，下起小雨来，雨点落在窗玻璃上的声音，好像给舞蹈者在轻轻地打拍子。……
    这个晚会结束后，我走回自己坐的车厢，又和一个勘探人员畅谈起来。他讲起1953年勘测兰新线时的一个感人的故事。那次，一组勘测人员走到无水的大戈壁滩上，戈壁滩是望不穿的，各人水壶里带的水都已经饮完了，有的人已偷偷喝起自己的小便来。这时，一个青年团员出去找水泉，突然他发现一处地方有点潮湿，就用手指去挖开鹅卵石，手指磨得出血了，终于挖出点水来。可是水很少，只能用嘴巴去吸水，他伏下身子，用嘴巴去吸，吸一口灌一口水到水壶里，等吸满了一水壶，自己伏得骨节都酸麻了，可是他把这壶水拿回来，却首先给技术人员喝，给别的人喝，自己仅是到末了才喝一点。这个故事我在1953年时听到过，可是现在再听一遍，仍是那么有力地激动着我。我的旅伴又接着说：“我们把荒山野岭当作家的人，也有一种乐处是别人享受不了的。许多别人没到过的地方，我们先到。我们望见前面白晃晃的一片，远看多像美丽的天湖呀！几个人一商议，就把这地方定名为兰新线的天湖车站。我们给荒野、戈壁上的车站取的名字都是很美的。事实上，火车一通到那里，建设也就跟着到那里，甚至建设得比我们原来取的名字更美——”
    这时，有人插进来说：“看，张掖快到了。”
    张掖，早有人说，将来要把这“赛江南”
    “塞外江南”建设得比江南更美。在这里，大树参天，水稻田连绵，黑河水系供给它不断的水。有人说，黑河水系有十五万三千公方的流量，将来在这一带，稻田更可以大大发展。这里还出产苹果、梨、水蜜桃、葡萄，当我们的南方工人在这里修路时，真恍若处身在故乡江南！
    列车飞速地在向西驶行，驶过清水、酒泉，经过职工用节约的器材修建的红水河桥，再往前，戈壁一块接连一块。当我从软卧车走到列车最后一节公务展望车去，车尾三面都是玻璃，从大玻璃窗远眺一望无际的戈壁上的新线路，我望见那座职工们曾和冰块作过艰巨斗争、修建起来的北大河桥逐渐露出桥身来。
    不久，列车就接近了万里长城的终点嘉峪关。坐在车厢里的人很清楚地看见高高的关楼的雄姿。一出关，远远地就能看见钻探石油的井架子一个接连着一个。这同古诗人形容的“一出嘉峪关，两眼泪不干，往前看，大戈壁，往后看，鬼门关！”的情景就大不相同了。
    列车出了嘉峪关，经过白杨河车站，就开进了油都玉门南站。“到玉门南站了！”有人在喊。我们兴奋地走出了车厢。这里，大批筑路工人正在准备继续西进。“西出阳关无故人”“春风不度玉门关”的古诗，已被新时代的历史巨笔删改为“西出阳关一片红”“春风普渡玉门关”！
