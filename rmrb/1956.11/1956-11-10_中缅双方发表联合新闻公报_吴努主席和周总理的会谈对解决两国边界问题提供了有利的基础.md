    Joint Communiqué

    During Chairman U Nu's visit to China, he and Premier Zhou Enlai held multiple talks in a friendly and mutually understanding atmosphere on issues of common concern to China and Burma, particularly the China-Burma boundary issue, based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.

    During the talks, the Chinese side put forward fair and reasonable suggestions, taking into account the interests of both sides, for resolving the China-Burma boundary issue. The Burmese side has agreed to consider these suggestions. Currently, the governments of China and Burma have reached an understanding that, starting from the end of November 1956, Chinese troops will withdraw from the area west of the 1941 line, and Burmese troops will withdraw from the three locations of Pianma, Hpimaw, and Gawlum. This troop withdrawal will be completed before the end of 1956.

    China and Burma believe that these talks have provided a favorable basis for resolving the China-Burma boundary issue, thereby helping to further consolidate and develop the friendly relations between China and Burma.

    联合新闻公报
    吴努主席在访问中国期间曾同周恩来总理根据和平共处的五项原则就中缅两国共同关心的问题，特别是中缅边界问题，在友好和互谅的气氛中进行了多次会谈。
    在会谈中，中国方面曾就解决中缅边界问题提出了照顾双方利益的公平合理的建议。这项建议缅方已答应予以考虑。目前，中缅两国政府取得谅解，从1956年11月底起中国军队将撤出1941年线以西地区，缅甸军队将撤出片马、岗房、古浪三个地方。这项撤军工作将在1956年年底前完成。
    中缅双方相信，这次会谈对解决中缅边界问题提供了有利的基础，从而将有助于中缅两国友好关系的进一步巩固和发展。
