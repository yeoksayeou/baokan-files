Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, November 5th: Hanoi newspapers today prominently published the news of the establishment of the Hungarian Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Government and the program of the Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Government. The "People's Daily" also published an editorial, hailing the great victory of the Hungarian people.

The "People's Daily" said that the Hungarian working class and working people, holding high the banner of patriotism and socialism, defeated the Nagy reactionary government and established the Hungarian Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Government headed by Kadar. This is a victory for the heroic Hungarian people, a common victory for socialism and the forces of peace. At the same time, this is also a heavy blow to the imperialists.

The "People's Daily" pointed out that the program of the Hungarian Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Government is fully in line with the independence and socialist interests of the Hungarian working class and people. The decisive condition for realizing this program is that it is necessary to vigorously defend the people's democratic power and resolutely suppress the imperialist running dogs and counter-revolutionaries.
