    Women's Federation Organizations Deeply Engage in the "Five Goods" Campaign Among Workers' Families; Nearly 80,000 New Families Emerge in Wuhan
    (Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan) Due to the Wuhan Municipal Women's Federation's deep engagement in the "Five Goods" campaign among workers' families, nearly 80,000 new types of worker families have emerged in Wuhan City.
    The so-called "Five Goods" are: good household planning, encouraging workers' good production, good unity and mutual aid, good hygiene, and good learning and education of children. Through these activities and education, worker families can maintain thrifty habits, and the family is filled with a democratic, mutually supportive, and loving atmosphere.
    Wuhan City started the "Five Goods" campaign in 1954. Through this long-term and in-depth work, many worker families have undergone profound changes. Wang Xiuying, a seaman's family member, was previously deeply influenced by bourgeois ideology. She indulged in enjoyment in life, loved to eat, drink, and play, and her family expenses exceeded her income. More than a year ago, she sold some of her clothes and owed seven months' rent. Because of economic hardship, she often quarreled with her husband, and her relationship with her neighbors was also not good. After the Wuhan Municipal Women's Federation advocated the "Five Goods" campaign, local Women's Federation cadres often patiently explained to Wang Xiuying the role of workers' families in socialist construction, raised her awareness, and encouraged her to actively participate in the "Five Goods" campaign. Women's Federation cadre Dai Lianxiang also often cared for her in life, helped her make household plans, and arranged her family life thriftily. When she encountered difficulties, she enthusiastically encouraged her to find ways to overcome them. Later, Wang Xiuying gradually changed her extravagant habits. Women's Federation cadres further educated and helped her establish new relationships in her family and neighborhood, and encouraged her to actively participate in learning and social activities. Now, not only has the phenomenon of debt been eradicated in Wang Xiuying's family, but she has also added some clothes and furniture, and the couple helps each other and lives happily. Her husband, relieved of his family burden, has become an activist in production. She herself was also selected as a model seaman's family member in the Yangtze River shipping system.
    The "Five Goods" campaign advocated by the Wuhan Municipal Women's Federation has been consistently adhered to for two years. Relying on the leadership of the Party, the Women's Federation organizations, in conjunction with various tasks, have deeply mobilized the women themselves to establish new socialist families. In carrying out this activity, the Women's Federation organizations always started from caring about the lives of the women, being considerate of them, and helping them. Therefore, it is easy to unite the broad masses of women, which also makes the workers' families more willing to accept socialist ideological education and actively participate in this activity. Due to the continuous emergence of new types of worker families in batches, this has directly promoted socialist construction.

    妇联组织深入职工家属中开展“五好”运动
    武汉出现近八万个新家庭
    新华社武汉讯　由于民主妇女联合会组织在职工家属中深入开展“五好”活动，武汉市目前已经出现了将近八万个新型的职工家庭。
    所谓“五好”，就是日子计划好，鼓励职工生产好，团结互助好，卫生好，学习和教育子女好。通过这些活动和教育，使职工家庭都能保持勤俭的习惯，家庭里充满民主、互助和友爱的气氛。
    武汉市开展“五好”活动是从1954年开始的。经过这种长期的深入的工作，许多职工家庭发生了深刻的变化。海员工人家属王秀英过去受资产阶级思想影响比较深，生活上贪图享受，爱吃喝，贪玩，家庭开支入不敷出，一年多以前卖掉了家里的一些衣服，还欠下七个月的房租，并且因为经济不宽裕，经常和丈夫吵架，跟邻居的关系也很不好。武汉市民主妇女联合会倡导“五好”活动以后，当地的妇联干部就经常耐心地向王秀英讲解职工家属在社会主义建设中的作用，提高她的觉悟，鼓励她积极参加“五好”活动。妇联干部戴连香还经常在生活上关心她，帮助她订出家庭计划，勤俭地安排家庭生活，当她遇到困难的时候，就热情地鼓励她想办法克服。后来，王秀英逐渐改变了铺张浪费的习惯。妇联干部进一步教育和帮助她在家庭和邻里中建立新的关系，并且鼓励她积极参加学习和社会活动。现在，王秀英家里不但欠债现象根除了，而且添置了一些衣服和家具，夫妻间互相帮助，生活得很愉快。她的丈夫由于放下了家庭包袱，变成了生产上的积极分子。她自己也被评选为长江航运系统的海员家属模范。
    武汉市妇联组织倡导的“五好”活动，在两年以来是一直坚持不懈的。妇联组织依靠着党的领导，结合各种工作，深入地发动妇女群众自己起来建立社会主义新型的家庭。而在开展这一活动时，妇联组织又总是从关心妇女群众的生活出发，体贴她们，帮助她们，因此容易团结广大的妇女群众，这样也就使职工家属们更加乐于接受社会主义的思想教育，积极参加了这个活动。由于成批的新型职工家庭不断涌现出来，这就对社会主义建设直接起了推动的作用。
