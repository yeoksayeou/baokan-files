Xinhua News Agency, Prague, November 11th: According to a Czechoslovak News Agency report, the Hungarian newspaper "People's Freedom" wrote on November 10th, commenting on the United Nations General Assembly meeting on November 9th: Currently, the United Nations organization can only help the Hungarian people by assisting in restoring calm and order in Hungary and healing the various wounds caused by the rebellion.

The newspaper pointed out that it seems the United Nations has not taken this path. The newspaper believes that the United Nations instead wants to incite people's hearts and hatred. It can be assumed that this attitude is precisely in line with the interests of the Western ruling groups. It is of no help in solving the urgent domestic problems of the Hungarian people.

    匈“人民自由报”评九日联大会议说红
    联合国并没有帮助匈牙利人民而是企图煽动仇恨
    新华社布拉格11日电　据捷克斯洛伐克通讯社消息，匈牙利的“人民自由报”11月10日在评论联合国大会11月9日的会议时写道：目前，联合国组织只有帮助恢复匈牙利的平静和秩序并且医治叛乱所造成的各种创伤，才能够对匈牙利人民有所帮助。
    这家报纸指出，看来联合国并没有走这条路。报纸认为，联合国倒是想煽动人心和仇恨。可以假定，正是这种态度符合于西方统治集团的利益。它对解决匈牙利人民的迫切的国内问题毫无帮助。
