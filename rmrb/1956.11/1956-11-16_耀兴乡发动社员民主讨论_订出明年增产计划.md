Xinhua News Agency report: Yaoxing Township in Jiangling County, Hubei Province, which achieved the goal of becoming a "100-jin cotton township," recently summarized this year's production work and formulated next year's agricultural production increase plan after enthusiastic discussions among cooperative members in each agricultural cooperative.

Yaoxing Township's more than 9,000 mu of cotton increased from an average yield of 48 jin of ginned cotton per mu last year to 102 jin, an increase of more than double; sesame, peanuts, soybeans, and other crops also increased by 30% to 50% compared to last year. Every cooperative increased production, and 99% of cooperative members in the township increased their income. Therefore, when discussing next year's production increase plan, some people believed that this year was the first year of cooperation, and the potential for increasing production was great, but it would be difficult to increase production further in the future, so they only sought to break even next year. However, most people disagreed with this view of "production reaching its peak."

In order to find new ways to increase production, the Yaoxing Township branch of the Chinese Communist Party and the cooperative committees of each agricultural cooperative held multiple symposiums, and some branches also conducted individual interviews with cooperative members, welcoming cooperative members to criticize this year's production work and fully express their opinions. In the key Yaoxing Agricultural Cooperative, led by the township Party branch, the average yield of ginned cotton per mu this year was 120 jin, the cooperative with the largest increase in production in the township. The cooperative members pointed out that 90 mu of land in the cooperative were not suitable for growing cotton, and planting cotton this year reduced income; 19 mu of land suitable for growing cotton were planted with sesame instead; and another 15 mu of cotton land reduced production due to excessive close planting. The cooperative members also mentioned that because the cooperative neglected sideline leadership, very few pigs were raised in the entire cooperative this year, which affected the lives of the cooperative members and reduced the source of fertilizer; the double-铧 plow purchased by the cooperative did not fully play its role, and the cotton fields failed to achieve universal deep plowing; and the work of cultivating and controlling insects in the cotton fields was also insufficient. After extensive and in-depth inspection, the cadres had a clear understanding, and the cooperative members' enthusiasm for increasing production also increased. Finally, the cooperative formulated a target of an average yield of 160 jin of ginned cotton per mu for the entire cooperative next year, as well as production increase targets for other crops and sideline production.

The Yaoxing Township branch of the Chinese Communist Party promptly introduced the experience of the Yaoxing Agricultural Cooperative in formulating a production increase plan to other agricultural cooperatives, promoting the work of summarizing production and formulating plans throughout the township. According to the township's inspection, a total of 2,334 mu of land this year failed to achieve adaptation to local conditions and reasonable close planting. If these two items are done well next year, the unit area yield of these fields can be increased by more than double. At the same time, there are still some "backward fields" in each agricultural cooperative. After the inspection, everyone's minds were clear, and they realized that production had not reached its peak, but that the potential for increasing production was still very great.

Another new problem was discovered in the inspection. Although some people admitted that production could still be increased next year, they believed that the cooperative was too busy with labor this year, and they were worried that if production were to be increased again next year, labor would be even more intensive, and their bodies might not be able to handle it. In response to this ideological concern of the masses, the township and cooperative leaders decided to launch in-depth and specific discussions. Everyone discovered that because of the lack of experience in the first year of running the cooperatives, the agricultural cooperatives did not arrange and use labor reasonably, and the promotion of new technologies was not stable enough, resulting in a lot of wasted labor, and the phenomenon of cooperative members idly standing by was also relatively common. If organized rationally, it can meet the annual agricultural labor and sideline (including cooperative members' household sideline) labor.

All nine agricultural cooperatives in the township held meetings of cooperative member representatives to discuss and approve each cooperative's production increase plan for next year. According to preliminary statistics, the township's cotton requirements for next year are an average yield of 150 jin of ginned cotton per mu, an increase of 47% compared to this year; the unit area yield of other crops is also required to increase by 20% to 50% respectively.

### 耀兴乡发动社员民主讨论  订出明年增产计划

    耀兴乡发动社员民主讨论
    订出明年增产计划
    据新华社讯　实现了棉花“百斤乡”目标的湖北省江陵县耀兴乡，最近在各农业社社员经过一番热烈的争论以后，总结了今年的生产工作，制定了明年的农业增产计划。
    耀兴乡九千多亩棉花，由去年平均亩产皮棉四十八斤提高到一百零二斤，增产一倍多；芝麻、花生、大豆等也比去年增产三成到五成。每个社都增了产，全乡99％的社员都增加了收入。因此，在讨论到明年的增产计划的时候，有些人认为今年是合作化的头一年，增产潜力很大，以后再增产就困难啦，只求明年能保本就好。但是大多数人不同意这种“增产到顶”的看法。
    为了找出新的增产窍门，中共耀兴乡支部和各农业社社委会召开了多次座谈会，有些支部还向社员作个别访问，欢迎社员们对今年的生产工作提出批评和充分发表意见。在中共乡支部领导的重点耀兴农业社，今年棉花平均亩产皮棉一百二十斤，是全乡增产最多的社。这个社的社员们指出，社里有九十亩田不适宜种棉花，今年种上棉花后减少了收入；有十九亩能种棉花的田，却种了芝麻；另有十五亩棉花田因为过分密植而减产。社员们还提到，由于社里忽视副业领导，今年全社养猪很少，既影响了社员生活，又减少了肥料来源；社里买的双铧犁没有充分发挥作用，棉田未能做到普遍深耕；对棉田中耕、治虫等工作也有做得不够的地方。经过广泛深入的检查，干部们心里有了数，社员们增产的劲头也高起来了。最后，这个社制定了明年全社棉花平均亩产皮棉一百六十斤的指标，以及其他作物和副业生产的增产指标。
    中共耀兴乡支部及时把耀兴农业社制定增产计划的经验介绍给其他的农业社，推动了全乡总结生产、制定计划的工作。据全乡检查，今年共有两千三百三十四亩田没有做到因地制宜和合理密植。明年如果做好这两项，就可以使这些田的单位面积产量提高一倍以上。同时，每一个农业社里都还有一部分“落后田”。检查以后，大家的头脑清醒了，认识到不是生产已经到顶，而是增产潜力还很大。
    在检查中又发现了另一个新的问题。有些人虽然承认明年还可以增产，但是认为今年社里劳动太紧张了，耽心明年再要增产，劳动将更加紧张，身体恐怕吃不消。乡、社领导方面根据群众的这种思想顾虑，决定展开深入、具体的讨论。大家发现，各农业社由于办社第一年经验不足，对劳动力的安排使用不尽合理，对新技术的推行不够稳当，以致浪费了不少的人工，社员窝工现象也比较普遍。如加以合理组织，就可以满足全年农业用工和副业（包括社员家庭副业）用工。
    全乡九个农业社都举行社员代表会议，讨论通过了各社的明年增产计划。据初步统计，明年全乡的棉花要求平均亩产皮棉一百五十斤，比今年提高47％；其他作物的单位面积产量也分别要求提高20％到50％。
