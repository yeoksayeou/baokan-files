    Foreign Authors' Articles Should Indicate the Source
    The paper "Existentialist Philosophy in the Service of Monopoly Capital" by I.S. Narski, published on page 7 of the People's Daily on November 22, is quite good in content. However, after reading it, I wondered whether Narski wrote this article in Chinese or in another language? I don't know. Is this the first time this article has been published in the People's Daily, or is it a reprint? I don't know either. I believe that when such a lengthy article is published in the People's Daily, the source should be indicated. If it is translated, that should also be stated.

    外国作者的文章要注明来处
    11月22日人民日报七版刊出的伊·斯·纳尔斯基的一篇论文“为垄断资本服务的生存主义哲学”，内容相当好。不过读后想到纳尔斯基这篇文章是用中文写的，还是用其它种文字写的呢？不知道。这篇文章是初次在人民日报上刊载呢，还是转载呢？也不知道。我认为，在人民日报上刊出这样大的篇幅的文章，应注明来处。如果是翻译出来的，也应当说明。
