    Xi'an City Automobile Repair Factories Establish Joint Conference
    To Help Each Other Solve Material Stockpiles and Shortages
    (Our newspaper reports) From March of this year, automobile repair factories in Xi'an City have been helping each other solve many material shortage problems. In the past, some automobile repair and maintenance shops had stockpiles of materials in their warehouses that they couldn't use up, while others were forced to suspend work and wait for materials due to shortages.
    In February of this year, automobile repair factories in Xi'an City launched an advanced producer movement. Workers were doing everything possible to ensure that cars were released from the factory ahead of schedule. However, the timely release of cars was often affected due to material supply issues. In order to solve the problem of material shortages, the Xi'an Automobile Repair Factory and other units established a material supply joint conference. Everyone signed material supply agreements with each other, using their stock materials to supply brother factories with what they urgently needed, without affecting their own production.
    Through the material supply joint conference, the problem of factories suspending work and waiting for materials has been basically solved. For example, recently the Shaanxi Province Xi'an Automobile Repair Factory was repairing a D235 Chebel diesel vehicle and was short of twenty or thirty kinds of parts. At that time, the Electrical and Mechanical Company didn't have a single one. If there were no agreement in place, people would have to be sent to other places to purchase them, which would take a long time and might not even be successful. Now, they only sent someone to borrow from the Xi'an City Public Bus Repair Factory and the joint state-private Xi'an Automobile Repair Factory, and all the materials were obtained. Currently, factories are not only supplying each other with ready-made parts, but factories with better equipment are also processing some parts for factories with poorer equipment. As a result of mutual support between factories, material stockpiling has also been reduced. For example, in the past, the Shaanxi Province Xi'an Automobile Repair Factory often failed to complete its profit remittance plan on time due to material stockpiling. Now, the factory's funds are not only not stockpiled, but the turnover time is also faster than originally stipulated. (Li Qian)

### 西安市各汽车修理厂建立联席会议  相互帮助解决材料积压和不足

    西安市各汽车修理厂建立联席会议
    相互帮助解决材料积压和不足
    本报讯　西安市各汽车修理厂，从今年3月份开始，互相帮助解决了不少材料不足的问题。过去，各汽车修理厂和保养场，有的仓库里积压着材料用不完，有的又因材料不足停工待料。
    今年2月份，西安市各汽车修理厂开展了先进生产者运动。工人们都想尽一切办法，争取使汽车提前出厂。但是，却经常因为材料供应不上影响汽车按时出厂。为了解决材料不足的问题，西安汽车修配厂等单位建立了材料供应联席会。大家互相签订材料供应协议书，在不影响本单位生产的情况下，以库存材料供应兄弟厂急需使用。
    通过材料供应联席会议，基本上解决了各厂停工待料的问题。如最近陕西省西安汽车修配厂承修D235切贝尔柴油车，缺二、三十种零件。当时交电公司一件没有，如果在没有订协议书之前，就得派人到外地采购，费很长时间还不一定能买到，现在他们只派人向西安市公共汽车修理厂和公私合营西安汽车修配厂借了一趟，就把所有材料都备齐了。目前各厂不仅是互相供应现成的零件，而且设备较好的厂还给设备差的厂加工一些零件。各厂互相支援的结果，材料积压现象也减少了。如陕西省西安汽车修配厂过去由于材料积压，往往影响按时完成上缴利润计划，现在，该厂资金不但没有积压，而且周转时间比原规定还要快。    （李茜）
