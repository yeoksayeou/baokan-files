Why Is Handmade Paper Production Decreasing?
    Dong Zhifu
    In recent years, the production of handmade paper has decreased significantly. In 1954, the national output of handmade paper was about 290,000 tons; in 1955, it dropped to 260,000 tons, and it continues to decline this year. The decline in handmade paper production in key paper-producing provinces such as Fujian, Jiangxi, and Zhejiang in recent years is shown in the following table:

    Province   1952    1953    1954    1955
    Fujian    24,032   22,365   23,714   12,407
    Jiangxi   20,724   20,356   19,303   13,991
    Zhejiang  76,878   69,984   66,909   66,588		(Unit: tons)

    The Xuzhou Special District in Jiangsu Province had 23 handmade paper mills before 1952, and now all of them have stopped production. In some counties in Shandong, the production of handmade paper in February and March of this year decreased by about 50% compared with the same period last year.

    What are the reasons for this? According to our analysis, there are the following points:

    First, the policy is not clear. In the past, the Ministry of Light Industry had also studied the development policy for handmade paper. Was it to be developed, maintained as is, or eliminated? However, no clear conclusion was reached. Therefore, for a long time, a laissez-faire attitude was adopted.

    Second, the leadership relationships are multiple and chaotic. Before 1955, the production cooperatives, groups, and individual paper-making households engaged in handmade paper production nationwide, whether professional or part-time, were all planned and tasked by the Central Handicraft Administration. Since the high tide of agricultural cooperation in 1955, many paper-making workers and farmers involved in paper-making have been incorporated into forestry cooperatives or agricultural cooperatives. The same paper-making workers and farmers are organized into cooperatives within the three systems of handmade paper-making, agriculture, and forestry. How to divide tasks and assign leadership? This has not yet been determined. We believe that the handmade paper-making industry should be uniformly managed by the Paper Industry Administration of the Ministry of Light Industry, as an assistant to machine-made paper.

    Due to the lack of clear regulations on the policy for handmade paper-making, and due to the unresolved leadership issues, leading personnel in relevant departments in many regions believe that handmade paper has no future, resulting in the idea of ​​disregarding paper-making production. In some areas, after the high tide of agricultural cooperation, there even appeared the phenomenon of preventing paper-making production and indiscriminate felling of bamboo forests. Rural cadres in Sha County, Fujian Province, told the masses: "Do you want to eat paper, or eat rice? If you want to eat rice, don't make paper." Ershidu District in Shaowu County is a paper-producing area with a long history, but the district head did not allow the masses to make paper, and organized the labor force to reclaim wasteland in the deep mountains fifty miles away. Some cadres in Fuyang County, Zhejiang Province, even put forward the wrong slogan of "plant what you eat, if you don't plant grain, eat bamboo" to the masses in the overproduction movement of 1954. Some areas in Shandong Province did not even issue food purchase certificates to members of paper-making cooperatives. All this greatly reduced the production enthusiasm of paper-making workers and paper farmers. At the same time, the phenomenon of indiscriminate felling of bamboo forests is also quite serious in various places, causing difficulties in the supply of raw materials for paper-making.

    Third, purchasing departments suppress purchase prices and pursue high profits. This is a major reason for the continuous decline in handmade paper production in recent years. Jiangxi Province is one of the key producing areas of handmade paper. The province's purchase price has been reduced by 22.8% to 56% compared with the past; the price of local newsprint in Qianshan County was reduced three times in one month in 1953, from 68 yuan per dan to 31 yuan. The production cost of sanitary paper in Zhejiang Province is 4.66 yuan per piece (25 jin), but the purchase price of the supply and marketing cooperative is only 3.68 yuan; the cost of general handmade paper is 17.27 yuan per piece (68 jin), and the purchase price is 14.7 yuan. The cost of Wanjin paper in Cenxi County, Guangxi Province, is 8.07 yuan per dan, but the purchase price has been reduced from 8.6 yuan to 8.3 yuan and 6.4 yuan, and now it has been reduced to 5.8 yuan. The Tianshui Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Gansu Province purchases cotton skin and mulberry skin for the paper-making industry at 3 to 5 fen per jin, but sells them to paper-making production cooperatives at 7 fen each, with an average profit of 60%. When the Yongjia County Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Zhejiang Province verified the production cost of paper-making, it set the wages of paper-making workers as: 15 yuan per month for male workers, 6 yuan per month for female workers, and 3 yuan per month for child workers. But historically, the wages of paper-making workers in this county were 10-20% higher than the income of farmers, and now the wages of paper-making workers are about 30-50% of the income of farmers. Therefore, about 30% of the paper-making workers in this county have transferred to agricultural cooperatives.

    When purchasing handmade paper, the handmade paper purchasing stations of the supply and marketing cooperatives in various provinces generally only rely on visual inspection and touch to arbitrarily classify and grade. For example, the grades of native paper purchased in Jiajiang County, Sichuan Province, are divided into 13 bright grades and 13 dark grades, a total of 26 grades. There are many grades and no standards. In order to increase profits, the purchasing units arbitrarily suppress the grades and prices. The Ninghua County Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Fujian Province purchased 16,000 dao of Yukou paper in the seventh district and lowered the price of "Deputy Second" paper (4.76 yuan per dao) to "Deputy Fourth" (3.96 yuan per dao). After the purchase, it was resold to Guangdong as "Deputy Second" paper.

    For the past three years, due to the continuous price reduction of handmade paper by commercial departments, many handmade paper producers have lost money and even gone bankrupt. The result of the commercial departments in Jiangxi Province suppressing purchase prices in recent years has led to the collapse of eight paper-making production cooperatives; nine paper-making cooperatives in counties such as Ningdu and Ruijin have lost a total of 88,900 yuan in the past two years. The Xiaopu Paper Industry Production Cooperative in Ningdu County has not only lost all of its own funds, but also owes the bank a loan of 6,500 yuan, which cannot be repaid. Four hundred and twenty-six paper vats have been abandoned in Sihui County, Guangdong Province, and 366 have been abandoned in Guangning County; according to incomplete statistics, a total of 1,454 paper vats have been abandoned in Guangdong Province. Longnan County, Jiangxi Province, originally had more than 180 vat households, with more than 4,000 people engaged in paper-making production. By 1955, only one paper-making production cooperative with 29 members remained, and it was still struggling to maintain production by lowering wages. Some paper-making workers in Hunan and other places have cut down bamboo forests and planted sweet potatoes and other crops due to difficult living conditions.

    The summary of the native paper professional meeting held on February 22 this year pointed out that the important key to increasing the production of native paper is the price issue, and it was decided to adjust the purchase price uniformly in April. However, until now, the practice of commercial departments suppressing purchase prices has not changed; although individual regions have made slight adjustments, the maximum does not exceed 10%, which is far from the price before the reduction, and many native paper producers continue to lose money. Therefore, the decline in handmade paper production continues to develop.

    In recent years, the national demand for paper has been increasing, and the production of machine-made paper is far from keeping up with the demand. Therefore, it is necessary to quickly find ways to reverse the decline in handmade paper production. We hope that the relevant central departments will solve the problems of the development policy, leadership relations, production and sales relations, and funding of handmade paper as soon as possible, formulate specific plans, and promote the gradual recovery and increase of handmade paper production. We hope that commercial departments will quickly correct the wrong practices of suppressing purchase prices to encourage the production enthusiasm of native paper producers and enable them to recuperate. Finally, we also hope that local party committees will also pay attention to this issue and promote its early resolution.

    土制纸为什么减产
    董直夫
    最近几年，手工业造纸产量显著下降。1954年，全国土制纸产量约为二十九万吨，1955年降到二十六万吨，今年仍在继续下降。福建、江西、浙江等重点产纸省份，这几年土制纸的减产情况如下表：
    省　别    1952年     1953年     1954年     1955年
    福　建    24，032    22，365    23，714    12，407
    江　西    20，724    20，356    19，303    13，991
    浙　江    76，878    69，984    66，909    66，588				（单位：吨）
    江苏省徐州专区在1952年以前有手工纸厂二十三家，现在全部停产；山东有些县份，土制纸今年二、三月份比去年同时期减产约50％。
    这是什么原因呢？据我们分析，有以下几点：
    第一、方针不明确。过去轻工业部对于土制纸的发展方针也曾作过研究。是发展呢，是维持现状呢，还是消灭呢？但是没有作出明确的结论。因此，很长时期采取了听其自生自灭的态度。
    第二、领导关系的多头和混乱。在1955年以前，全国手工造纸的生产社、组以及个体造纸户，不论专业、兼营都由中央手工业管理局计划生产，布置任务。自从1955年农业合作化高潮到来以后，许多造纸工人和造纸的农民都被卷入林业合作社或农业合作社。同样是造纸工人和造纸的农民，被组织在手工造纸、农业、林业三个系统的合作社内。如何分担任务、分工领导？至今还没有确定。我们认为，手工造纸业应该由轻工业部造纸工业管理局统一管起来，作为机制纸的助手。
    由于对手工造纸的方针没有明确规定，由于领导问题没有解决，许多地区有关部门的领导人员认为手工纸没有前途，产生了轻视造纸生产的思想。有些地区在农业合作化高潮到来以后，甚至出现了阻止进行造纸生产和滥砍竹林的现象。福建省沙县乡村干部对群众说：“你要吃纸，还是吃饭。如果要吃饭，就不要造纸。”邵武县二十都区是历史悠久的产纸区，区长却不让群众造纸，把劳动力组织到五十里外的深山去开荒。浙江省富阳县的一些干部在1954年超额增产运动中，竟向群众提出“种什么，吃什么，不种粮食吃毛竹”的错误口号。山东省有的地区竟不发给造纸合作社社员购粮证。这都使造纸的工人和纸农的生产积极性大为降低。同时，各地滥伐竹林的现象也相当严重，造成了造纸原料供应上的困难。
    第三、采购部门压价收购，追逐高利。这是造成土制纸连年减产的重大原因。江西省是土制纸重点产区之一，全省收购价格比过去降低22.8％到56％；铅山县土报纸在1953年一个月内降价三次，由每担六十八元降为三十一元。浙江省卫生纸每件（二十五斤）生产成本是四点六六元，供销合作社收购价却为三点六八元；一般土纸每件（六十八斤）成本为十七点二七元，收购价格为十四点七元。广西省岑溪县万金纸的成本为每担八点零七元，收购价格却从八点六元压到八点三元和六点四元，现在又压低到五点八元。甘肃省天水供销合作社为造纸业代购棉皮、桑皮，以每斤三分到五分收进，却一律按七分卖给造纸生产合作社，平均利润为60％。浙江省永嘉县供销合作社在核定造纸生产成本的时候，把造纸工人的工资定为：男工每月十五元，女工每月六元，童工每月三元。但在历史上，这个县造纸工人的工资高于农民收入10—20％，现在造纸工人的工资约相当于农民收入的30—50％。因此，这个县已经有30％左右的造纸工人转入了农业合作社。
    各省供销合作社手工纸收购站，在收购土纸的时候，一般仅凭眼看手摸，随便分等定级。如四川省夹江县收购土纸的等级分为明十三级、暗十三级，共二十六级，等级很多，又无标准，收购单位为了提高利润，便随便压级压价。福建省宁化县供销合作社，在第七区收购玉扣纸一万六千刀，把“副二”号的纸（每刀四元七角六分）压低到“副四”号（每刀三元九角六分）。收购以后，转手又以“副二”号运到广东出售。
    三年以来，由于商业部门对土制纸连续压价收购，许多土纸生产者都亏本，以至破产。江西省的商业部门几年来压价收购的结果，使造纸生产合作社垮了八个；宁都、瑞金等县九个造纸合作社两年来共亏本八万八千九百多元。宁都县小浦纸业生产合作社，除自有资金全部赔光以外，还欠银行贷款六千五百元，无法偿还。广东省四会县已经荒废了纸槽四百二十六个，广宁县荒废了三百六十六个；广东全省据不完全统计，共荒废了纸槽一千四百五十四个。江西省龙南县原有一百八十多个槽户，四千多人从事造纸生产，到1955年只剩了一个有社员二十九名的造纸生产合作社，还靠降低工资来勉强维持生产。湖南等地有些造纸工人因为生活困难，已经把竹林砍掉，改种甘薯等农作物。
    今年2月22日召开的土纸专业会议总结中，曾经提出土纸增产的重要关键是价格问题，并且决定在
  4月份一律调整收购价格。但是，直到现在，商业部门压价收购的作法并未改变；个别地区虽稍调整，但是最多不超过10％，同压低前的价格相差很远，许多土纸生产者继续赔钱。因此，土制纸减产情况仍在继续发展。
      这几年来，全国需要纸张数量不断增加，机制纸产量远远赶不上需要。因此，需要迅速设法扭转土制纸减产的局面。我们希望中央有关部门早日解决土制纸发展方针、领导关系、产销关系和资金等问题，制定具体方案，推动土制纸逐步恢复和增加生产。我们希望商业部门迅速纠正压价收购等错误作法，以鼓舞土纸生产者的生产积极性，并使他们能生养将息。最后，我们还希望各地党委也重视这个问题，推动这个问题的早日解决。
