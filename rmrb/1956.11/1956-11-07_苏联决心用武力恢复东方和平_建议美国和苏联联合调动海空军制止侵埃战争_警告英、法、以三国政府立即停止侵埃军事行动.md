Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 6th: TASS, Moscow: On November 5, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Bulganin, wrote a letter to U.S. President Eisenhower on the situation in Egypt, suggesting that the United States cooperate with the Soviet Union to stop the aggression against Egypt.

    The letter stated that, at this critical juncture which is extremely dangerous to universal peace, I speak to you in the name of the Soviet government.
    For a week now, the armed forces of Britain, France, and Israel, subservient to external forces, have unjustifiably invaded Egypt, causing death and destruction. The whole world sees that the war of aggression against Egypt and the Arab people is expanding, and their only crime is that they are defending their freedom and independence.
    The situation in Egypt requires the United Nations to take the most resolute action immediately. If such action is not taken, the United Nations will lose its prestige before all mankind and will collapse.
    The Soviet Union and the United States are permanent members of the Security Council and are two major powers possessing all kinds of modern weapons, including atomic and hydrogen bombs. We have a special responsibility to stop the war and restore peace and tranquility in the Middle East region.
    We believe that if the Soviet government and the U.S. government firmly express their determination to guarantee peace and oppose aggression, then the aggression will end, and there will be no more war.
    Mr. President, at this most dangerous moment when the supreme moral principles and the foundations and purposes of the United Nations are being tested, the Soviet government suggests close cooperation with the U.S. government in order to stop aggression and end further bloodshed.
    The United States has a strong naval presence in the Mediterranean region. The Soviet Union also has a strong navy and air force. Immediately and jointly deploying these forces of the U.S. and the Soviet Union in accordance with the resolutions of the United Nations would be a reliable guarantee to stop the aggression against the Egyptian people and the Arab countries of the East.
    The Soviet government calls on the U.S. government to work together in the United Nations to take resolute measures to stop the aggression.
    The Soviet government has already submitted corresponding proposals to the United Nations Security Council and the Emergency Special Session of the United Nations General Assembly.
    This joint step by the United States and the Soviet Union does not threaten the interests of Britain and France. The British and French people do not want war; they, like our people, hope to maintain peace.
    In addition to Britain and France, many other countries are also concerned about the immediate restoration of peace and the resumption of normal navigation on the Suez Canal, which has been interrupted by the war. The purpose of this piratical war is to restore the colonial order in the East that has been overthrown by the people. If this war is not stopped, it contains great dangers and may develop into a third world war.
    If the Soviet Union and the United States support the victims of aggression, then other members of the United Nations will work together with us. This will greatly enhance the prestige of the United Nations, restore and consolidate peace.
    The Soviet government is willing to hold immediate negotiations with the U.S. government to implement the above-mentioned proposals so that effective actions to maintain peace can be taken within the shortest possible time.
    At this historically tense moment that determines the fate of the entire Arab East and peace, I await your affirmative answer.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 6th: According to TASS, Moscow: On November 5, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Bulganin, wrote letters separately to British Prime Minister Eden and French Prime Minister Mollet, calling on the British and French governments to stop the armed aggression against Egypt. Bulganin said in his letter that the war of aggression against Egypt by Britain, France, and Israel has the potential to spread to other countries and develop into a third world war. The Soviet government has suggested to the United Nations and the U.S. President that they use naval and air forces together with other members of the United Nations to stop the war in Egypt and stop the acts of aggression. The Soviet government is determined to use force to annihilate the aggressors and restore peace in the East. It is hoped that Eden and Mollet, as well as the British and French governments, can demonstrate due reason in this emergency, soberly assess the current situation, and draw appropriate conclusions from it.

    Bulganin said that the Soviet government believes it is necessary to urge Eden and Mollet to pay attention to the fact that the war of aggression against Egypt, instigated by Britain and France and provoked by Israel, contains extremely dangerous consequences for world peace. Despite the resolution passed by the Emergency Special Session of the United Nations General Assembly demanding an immediate cessation of military action and the withdrawal of foreign troops from Egyptian territory, Britain, France, and Israel have disregarded this resolution and intensified military operations, dispatching landing forces to land on Egyptian territory. In this way, the British and French governments, together with the Israeli government, have embarked on the road of unprovoked aggression against Egypt.
    Bulganin pointed out that the so-called excuse of guaranteeing the freedom of navigation of the Suez Canal, on which the British and French governments based their attack on Egypt, is completely untenable. Because, as everyone knows, Egypt has fully guaranteed the freedom of navigation of the Suez Canal, and it is precisely the current military actions of Britain and France that have disrupted the navigation. Therefore, the armed aggression by Britain and France against Egypt, which had just become independent not long ago and did not have sufficient self-defense capabilities, has other major goals. This goal is to eliminate the national independence of the Middle East countries and restore the colonial slavery system in the Arab countries that has been overthrown by the people. This cannot be concealed by any excuse.
    Bulganin asked the heads of the British and French governments, what would be the situation of Britain and France if a more powerful country with various modern destructive weapons were to attack Britain and France?
    Bulganin said that we are deeply concerned about the development of the situation in the Middle East, and from the interests of defending peace, the Soviet government believes it is necessary to appeal to the British and French governments, as well as the parliaments, trade unions, and all the people of these two countries: stop armed aggression and end the bloodshed.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 6th: According to TASS reports: On November 5, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Bulganin, wrote a letter to Israeli Prime Minister Ben-Gurion. This letter has been delivered to the Israeli Chargé d'Affaires in the Soviet Union by Soviet Foreign Minister Shepilov.

    Bulganin said in the letter that the Soviet government and all peace-loving mankind angrily condemn the criminal acts of the aggressors who violated the territorial integrity, sovereignty, and independence of Egypt. The Israeli government, willing to act as a tool of foreign imperialist forces, continues to carry out arrogant adventures, provoking the Eastern peoples who are fighting against colonialism and for their freedom and independence, and all peace-loving people in the world, despite these condemnations.
    This behavior of the Israeli government clearly shows that the false assurances about Israel's love of peace and its desire for peaceful coexistence with its Arab neighbors are worthless. The Israeli government executes the will of others, acts according to external instructions, and criminally and irresponsibly trifles with the fate of the world, trifles with the fate of its own people. It sows the seeds of hatred for the Israeli state among the people of the Eastern countries, which cannot but affect Israel's future, and this will raise the question of whether Israel can continue to exist as a state.
    The Soviet government is concerned about maintaining peace and ensuring tranquility in the Middle East, and it is now taking measures to end the war and stop the aggressors.
    We hope that the Israeli government will change its mind while it is not too late and stop its military actions against Egypt. We appeal to you, to the parliament, and to all the people of Israel: stop the aggression and withdraw your troops from Egyptian territory.
    Considering the current situation, the Soviet government has decided to let the Soviet Ambassador to Tel Aviv leave Israel and return to Moscow immediately.
    We hope that the Israeli government will fully understand and assess this warning of ours.

    苏联决心用武力恢复东方和平
    建议美国和苏联联合调动海空军制止侵埃战争
    警告英、法、以三国政府立即停止侵埃军事行动
    新华社6日讯　塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁11月5日就埃及局势问题给美国总统艾森豪威尔写了一封信，建议美国同苏联合作以制止对埃及的侵略。
    信中说，在这个对普遍和平非常危急的紧要关头，我以苏联政府的名义向您讲几句话。
    英国、法国和听从外力支配的以色列的武装部队无端地侵入埃及，造成死亡和破坏，至今已经有一个星期了。全世界都看到，对埃及和阿拉伯人民的侵略战争正在扩大，而他们的全部罪过只不过是他们在保卫自己的自由和独立。
    埃及的局势要求联合国立即采取最坚决的行动。如果不采取这样的行动，联合国就会在全人类面前失掉威信，就会垮台。
    苏联和美国是安全理事会的常任理事国，而且是两个拥有包括原子弹和氢弹在内的各种现代武器的大国。我们特别有责任去制止战争和恢复中近东区域的和平和安宁。
    我们相信，如果苏联政府和美国政府坚决表示保证和平和反对侵略的决心，那么侵略将会结束，再也不会有战争。
    总统先生，当此至高的道义原则和联合国的基础和宗旨经受考验的最危险时刻，为了制止侵略和停止继续流血，苏联政府向美国政府建议紧密合作。
    美国在地中海地区驻扎有强大海军。苏联也拥有强大海军和空军。根据联合国的决议立即联合地调用美苏的这些军队，将是制止对埃及人民、对阿拉伯东方各国的侵略的可靠保障。
    苏联政府呼吁美国政府在联合国共同努力，采取制止侵略的坚决措施。
    苏联政府已经向联合国安理会和联合国大会紧急特别会议提出相应的建议。
    美国和苏联这种共同步骤，并不威胁英国和法国的利益。英法两国的人民大众不要战争，他们也和我国人民一样，希望保持和平。
    除了英法以外，其他许多国家也关心立即恢复和平，恢复被战争中断了的苏伊士运河的正常通航。这次强盗性战争的目的是在东方恢复被人民推翻了的殖民主义秩序。假如这次战争不加以制止，它包含很大的危险，并且可能发展为第三次世界大战。
    如果苏联和美国支持侵略的受害者，那末其他联合国会员国将和我们一起共同努力。这样就能大大提高联合国的威信、恢复并且巩固和平。
    苏联政府愿和美国政府立即就实现上述建议举行谈判，以便在最短期间内能够采取有效的维护和平的行动。
    在这决定整个阿拉伯东方以及和平的命运的历史上紧张的时刻，我等候您肯定的回答。
    新华社6日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁5日分别写信给英国首相艾登和法国总理摩勒，呼吁英法政府停止对埃及的武装侵略。布尔加宁在信中说，英、法和以色列对埃及的侵略战争有可能扩及到其他国家，发展成第三次世界大战。苏联政府已经向联合国和美国总统建议，同联合国其他会员国一起使用海军和空军来制止埃及战争，制止侵略行动。苏联政府决心使用武力来歼灭侵略者和恢复东方和平。希望艾登和摩勒及英法政府在这紧急关头，能表现出应有的理智，清醒地估计当前局势，并且从中作出适当的结论。
    布尔加宁说，苏联政府认为有必要促请艾登和摩勒注意，英法策动而由以色列挑起的对埃及的侵略战争，包藏着对世界和平极端危险的后果。尽管联合国大会紧急特别会议通过决议，要求立即停止军事行动和从埃及领土撤出外国军队，但是，英国、法国和以色列不顾这项决议，仍然加紧军事行动，派遣登陆部队在埃及领土登陆，这样，英法政府就同以色列政府一起走上了无端侵略埃及的道路。
    布尔加宁指出，英法政府在进攻埃及方面所依据的所谓为了保证苏伊士运河的自由通航的借口，是完全站不住脚的。因为，大家都非常清楚，埃及曾经充分地保证了苏伊士运河的通航自由，而正是英法目前的军事行动破坏了通航。因此，英法对不久以前刚刚独立、还没有足够的自卫能力的埃及的武装侵略是有着其他重大目标的，这个目标在于消灭中近东国家的民族独立，在阿拉伯国家恢复被人民推翻了的殖民奴役制度。这一点不论用什么借口也是掩饰不了的。
    布尔加宁问英、法政府首脑道，如果拥有各种现代化毁灭性武器的更强大的国家向英国和法国进攻的话，那么英法两国会处于怎么样的境地呢？
    布尔加宁说，我们深深地为中近东的事态发展忧虑，从保卫和平的利益出发，苏联政府认为有必要向英、法政府以及这两个国家的议会、工会和全体人民发出呼吁：停止武装侵略，终止流血。
    新华社6日讯　据塔斯社报道：苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁11月5日写信给以色列总理本—古里安。这封信已经由苏联外交部长谢皮洛夫交给以色列驻苏联的临时代办。
    布尔加宁在信中说，苏联政府和整个爱好和平的人类都愤怒地痛斥侵犯埃及领土完整、主权和独立的侵略者的犯罪行为。甘愿充当外国帝国主义势力的工具的以色列政府不顾这些，继续进行狂妄的冒险，向正在为反对殖民主义和为自己的自由、独立而斗争的东方人民，向世界一切爱好和平的人民挑衅。
    以色列政府的这种行为清楚地说明，关于以色列爱好和平和它渴望同阿拉伯邻国和平共处的那些虚伪保证是没有价值的。以色列政府执行别人的意志，按照外来的指示办事，罪恶昭著和不负责任地玩弄世界的命运，玩弄本国人民的命运。它在东方国家人民中间散播痛恨以色列国家的种子，这不能不影响到以色列的未来，这将使以色列是否能继续作为一个国家存在发生问题。
    苏联政府关心维护和平和保障中近东安宁的问题，它现在在采取措施以终止战争，制止侵略者。
    我们希望，以色列政府趁现在还不太晚的时候回心转意，停止对埃及的军事行动。我们向你们，向议会，向全体以色列人民呼吁：停止侵略，从埃及领土撤回自己的军队。
    考虑到目前所造成的局势，苏联政府决定让苏联驻特拉维夫大使离开以色列，立刻回莫斯科。
    我们希望，以色列政府充分地理解和估计到我们这个警告。
