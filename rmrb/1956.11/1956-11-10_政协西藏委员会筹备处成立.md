    政协西藏委员会筹备处成立
    新华社拉萨9日电　中国人民政治协商会议西藏委员会筹备处8日正式成立。
    筹备处处长索康·旺清格勒在成立会上说，筹备处的主要任务是积极和西藏地区各方面、各教派、各寺庙、各群众团体和社会贤达协商研究政协西藏委员会组成人员的名单，草拟组织简则，准备成立大会的议程、文件等。许多筹备处委员在会上的发言中都希望政协西藏委员会能够尽快成立。
    7日才从北京返抵拉萨的中央人民政府驻西藏代表张经武上将也到会祝贺。他向筹备委员们介绍了中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会的情况、性质和作用，勉励筹备处的委员们要主动地去团结各界人士，互相信任，遇事反复协商。张经武代表特别指出，参加筹备处工作的共产党员要不怕听取反对的意见，只有经过反复的研究讨论，才能使各项工作切合西藏的实际情况。
