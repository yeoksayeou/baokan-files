Reactions to Criticism

    Difficulty in Subscribing to Newspapers Abroad Will Be Reduced

    A letter from the Export Department of the General Store of the International Bookstore states: We, as the unit responsible for distributing books and periodicals abroad, are deeply concerned about the letter published in the People's Daily on August 31st by Wu Daying, reflecting the difficulty in subscribing to newspapers abroad. In the Soviet Union, all matters concerning subscription methods, prices, etc., for Chinese newspapers and periodicals are determined by the Soviet Post Office and are not bound by any agreements signed with relevant departments in our country. According to our understanding, before July this year, post offices throughout the Soviet Union could subscribe to Chinese newspapers at any time. From next year, subscriptions will be accepted on a quarterly basis. Work may be affected during the transition between the old and new subscription methods. We have suggested to relevant Soviet departments to find ways to improve this.

    The reason why it takes more than a month to purchase magazines such as "Study" in Leningrad is mainly due to the time-consuming postal process. Newspapers are sent by air to Moscow for forwarding, which is faster. Magazines are sent by surface mail and then forwarded by Moscow, which generally takes about a month. From next year, the procedure of forwarding by Moscow will be eliminated, and the delivery time is estimated to be slightly faster.

    Working Hours of Telegraph Operators Will Be Reasonably Arranged

    A letter from the Haihe Transportation Bureau of the Ministry of Communications states: The letter "Who Can Work Twenty-Four Hours" published in the People's Daily on October 13th criticized our bureaucracy. This criticism is correct. We have notified all maritime transportation bureaus and port authorities to conduct inspections to correct the current phenomenon of excessive working hours and excessive labor intensity for telegraph operators. Any staffing shortages must be filled.

专栏：对批评的反应

    对批评的反应
    国外订报困难将减少
    国际书店总店出口部来信：8月31日人民日报上发表吴大英反映在国外订报困难的来信，作为负责对国外发行书刊的单位，我们对此深表关切。在苏联发行中国报刊，所有有关订阅办法、价格等事宜，都是由苏联邮局决定的，并未受与我国有关部门签订的任何协定的约束。据我们了解，今年7月份以前，苏联各地邮局本可随时收订中国报纸，明年起将改为按季收订，在新旧订阅办法交替期间，工作可能受到影响。我们已向苏联有关部门建议设法改进。
    “学习”等杂志，在列宁格勒要经过一个多月才能购到，主要是由于邮寄费时的原故。报纸是航寄莫斯科转发的，比较快些，杂志都用平寄，再由莫斯科转发，时间一般就需要一个月左右。从明年起，将省去由莫斯科转发的手续，寄达的时间估计可以略为加快。
    报务员的工时将合理安排
    交通部海河运输局来信说：10月13日人民日报刊登的“谁能工作二十四小时”的来信，批评我们的官僚主义。这一批评是正确的。我们已通知各海运局、港务局进行检查，纠正现有报务人员工作时间过长，劳动强度过强的现象，凡定员不足的要补足定员。
