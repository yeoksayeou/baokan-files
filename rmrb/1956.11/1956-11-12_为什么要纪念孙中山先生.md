Why Commemorate Mr. Sun Yat-sen

Luo Longji

On November 12 this year, all the Chinese people solemnly commemorate the 90th anniversary of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's birth. This is a major event of extremely important educational significance to the Chinese people. Why should the Chinese people commemorate Mr. Sun Yat-sen? Regarding this question, some young people, and even a few middle-aged people, do not seem to have the correct answer. I occasionally heard someone say: The decision of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference to commemorate the 90th anniversary of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's birth is the result of the "long-term coexistence" of the democratic parties, because Mr. Sun Yat-sen was the founder of the Chinese Kuomintang, and this commemoration can play a role in consolidating and expanding the united front. Others say: The reactionary group fleeing in Taiwan is still hanging the signboard of the Kuomintang and using Mr. Sun Yat-sen's name to deceive the people. Our commemoration of Mr. Sun Yat-sen is to strengthen the role of peaceful liberation of Taiwan. I think these views are inappropriate and even incomplete.

Mr. Sun Yat-sen was a great revolutionary in Chinese history. His great personality, advanced ideas, and revolutionary achievements are models for the Chinese people, and should be remembered and learned by all Chinese people. The Chinese people should commemorate Mr. Sun Yat-sen this year, and should continue to commemorate him in the future. China's history having a great revolutionary like Mr. Sun Yat-sen is the glory of the Chinese nation. The Chinese people should never forget such a revolutionary giant in Chinese history.

It has been forty-five years since the Xinhai Revolution. It has also been thirty years since Mr. Sun Yat-sen passed away. What young and middle-aged people have seen and heard in the past thirty years is the vigorous Chinese people's revolution led by the Communist Party of China, and today everyone is enjoying the glory and happiness brought about by this revolutionary victory. Therefore, it is understandable that some people do not know enough about the name and achievements of a revolutionary in history, a pioneer in the Chinese revolution like Mr. Sun Yat-sen. Here, it must also be pointed out that after Mr. Sun Yat-sen's death in 1925, Chiang Kai-shek's pseudo-regime betrayed Mr. Sun Yat-sen's doctrine and tarnished the glorious signboard of the Kuomintang! Hanging a sheep's head while selling dog meat, offering genuine prescriptions but selling fake medicine, Chiang Kai-shek bankrupted the Kuomintang's reputation! Mr. Sun Yat-sen's loyal followers continued to struggle within the Kuomintang and carry out the revolution in China, adhering to Mr. Sun Yat-sen's doctrine. However, because the general public resented the reactionary rule, they became disgusted with the Kuomintang. Because they were disgusted with the Kuomintang, they neglected Mr. Sun Yat-sen's doctrine, theories, and revolutionary cause. These facts make it impossible for some people in society to fully understand the true meaning of commemorating Mr. Sun Yat-sen. These facts also illustrate the necessity and importance of solemnly commemorating Mr. Sun Yat-sen today. We must use this method to enable the Chinese people to have a true understanding of the personality, ideas, and achievements of this great revolutionary in history, so that the valuable legacy of a great revolutionary in history can be passed down through generations.

Personally, I was still a child during the Xinhai Revolution in 1911. Of course, I was not fortunate enough to directly receive the teachings of this great revolutionary. However, Mr. Sun Yat-sen had a profound influence on my childhood thinking. From October 1911, I began to hear terms such as "revolution," "republic," "democracy," "freedom," and "equality." Since then, and until today, I have consistently expressed deep love and high respect for Mr. Sun Yat-sen. In China, I believe that people of my age have been similarly deeply influenced by Mr. Sun Yat-sen's ideas and have love and respect for Mr. Sun Yat-sen.

I only saw Mr. Sun Yat-sen from a distance once in my life. I have never participated in the Tongmenghui or the Kuomintang. But I have always admired the personality, ideas, and career of this great revolutionary. In 1925, when I was studying in the United States and serving as the president of the Chinese Students' Association in the United States, when the news of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's death in Beijing reached the United States, I immediately called on all Chinese students in the United States to hold a memorial service for Mr. Sun Yat-sen. At that time, I believed that Mr. Sun Yat-sen's personality, ideas, and career would be immortal and should be learned by the Chinese people. Recently, Mr. Shao Lizi copied a passage from my speech at the memorial service for Mr. Sun Yat-sen thirty years ago from the "Sun Yat-sen Series" and sent it to me. The passage is as follows:

"Mr. Sun's doctrines are highly systematic. The Three Principles of the People represent the culmination of modern political philosophy, and the Five-Power Constitution is a new principle that is not easily discovered. Mr. Sun's political philosophy should be regarded as equal to the Social Contract and The Spirit of the Laws. The Chinese people have already recognized Mr. Sun's achievements in establishing merit and virtue. As for his writings, after his works are translated into Western languages, the Western academic community will recognize their place."

My praise for Mr. Sun Yat-sen's doctrines in this passage is not appropriate enough. Rousseau's Social Contract and Montesquieu's The Spirit of the Laws were political philosophies that shook the world before the French Revolution, and they promoted democratic revolutions around the world. Rousseau and Montesquieu were advanced thinkers of the 18th-century world democratic revolution. Therefore, I compared Mr. Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary ideas with Rousseau and Montesquieu. Today, Mr. Sun Yat-sen's Principle of People's Livelihood, his later socialist revolutionary ideas of "alliance with Russia, alliance with the Communist Party, and assistance to peasants and workers" and "taking Russia as a teacher" are even more advanced than the progressive ideas of Rousseau and Montesquieu. Reviewing and measuring historical figures from a historical perspective, there is no doubt that Mr. Sun Yat-sen was a progressive politician and a great revolutionary in Chinese history. He played a major role in paving the way for the Chinese people's revolution and socialist revolution.

Recently, many articles about Mr. Sun Yat-sen have been published in newspapers and magazines, providing detailed introductions to Mr. Sun Yat-sen's personality, ideas, and career. Today, I would only like to share some personal thoughts on Mr. Sun Yat-sen's achievements in "establishing words, establishing merit, and establishing virtue."

Regarding establishing words, Mr. Sun Yat-sen once said in "The History of the Chinese Revolution": "In my planning of the Chinese revolution, the doctrines I hold are derived from inheriting the inherent ideas of our country, from regulating the European theories and deeds, and from what I have uniquely seen and created." These words indeed summarize the origin and system of all of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's thoughts and doctrines. Critically accepting the culture of the motherland, carefully absorbing Western culture, using his own independent thinking, integrating and developing them, Mr. Sun Yat-sen's method of doing scholarship is worth learning by the Chinese people.

Regarding establishing merit, the Xinhai Revolution led by Mr. Sun Yat-sen was an event of great historical significance in China. Mr. Sun Yat-sen himself said: "Washing away the shame of more than two hundred and sixty years, making all ethnic groups in the country equal." "Eradicating the traces of more than four thousand years of monarchical autocracy, so that democratic politics can begin." The greatness of the revolutionary result is "truly worthy of a special record in Chinese history, and future generations will benefit from it." However, Mr. Sun Yat-sen did not dwell on his achievements. He not only did not become complacent, but he continued to carry out the revolution to realize all his lofty political ideals. In order to pursue the goals of freedom and equality for the Chinese people, national prosperity, people's well-being, and world harmony, Mr. Sun Yat-sen dedicated everything to the Chinese people's revolution. Mr. Sun Yat-sen's political ideals and revolutionary direction developed with the progress of the times. Mr. Sun Yat-sen's sincerity and enthusiasm in carrying the revolution through to the end are worth learning by the Chinese people.

Regarding establishing virtue, Mr. Sun Yat-sen's life of revolution is an extremely glorious moral history. In forty years of revolution, he demonstrated the fearless spirit of perseverance, resilience, fearlessness of difficulties, and avoidance of danger. The Xinhai Revolution was his success after ten consecutive failures. This shows Mr. Sun Yat-sen's determination and patience for revolution, similar to that of a great scientist pursuing truth in the laboratory. Because he had a firm belief that the revolution would surely succeed, he never lost heart in the face of failure; because he had outstanding courage to ensure that the revolution must be thorough, he never lost heart in the face of setbacks. He was tolerant of the mistakes of party members, and forgave their faults once they admitted them; he forgave the crimes of traitors as soon as they confessed their guilt. Mr. Sun Yat-sen's motive for revolution was benevolence, so he was a selfless revolutionary; a revolutionary of "great public-mindedness"; a revolutionary of "the world is for all." Mr. Sun Yat-sen's noble and great personality is worth learning by the Chinese people.

Why commemorate Mr. Sun Yat-sen? Because the Chinese people want to learn from Mr. Sun Yat-sen, and want to learn from Mr. Sun Yat-sen forever!

    为什么要纪念孙中山先生
    罗隆基
    今年11月12日，全中国人民都用隆重的仪式纪念孙中山先生九十周年诞辰。这对中国人民是有极其重大教育意义的一件大事。中国人民为什么要纪念孙中山先生？对这样一个问题，社会上有些青年人，甚至有少数中年人似乎还没有正确的答案。我偶然听到有人说：中国人民政治协商会议决议纪念孙中山先生九十周年诞辰，是民主党派“长期共存”的结果，是因为孙中山先生为中国国民党的创始人，这种纪念可以发生巩固和扩大统一战线的作用。另有些人说：逃窜在台湾的反动集团还挂着国民党的招牌，利用孙中山先生的名义做欺骗人民的号召，我们纪念孙中山先生是加强和平解放台湾的作用。我认为这种种看法是不妥当的，更是不全面的。
    孙中山先生是中国历史上一个伟大的革命家。他的伟大人格，先进思想，和革命功绩是中国人民的典型，是中国人民都应该追念和学习的。中国人民今年应该纪念孙中山先生，今后还应该纪念孙中山先生。中国历史上有孙中山先生这样伟大的革命家，是中国民族的光荣。中国人民应该永远不忘记中国历史上这样一个革命伟人。
    辛亥革命到今天已经四十五年了。孙中山先生逝世亦已经三十年了。青年人和中年人近三十年来所见、所闻是中国共产党领导的轰轰烈烈的中国人民革命，并且今天大家又正在享受着这个革命胜利带来的光荣和快乐，因此，一些人对历史上一个革命家，对中国革命中一个承先启后的孙中山先生的名字和成就了解不够，这是可以理解的。这里，还必须指出，从1925年孙中山先生逝世以后，蒋介石二十余年的伪政权背叛了孙中山先生的主义，把国民党这块光荣的招牌污损了！挂起羊头卖狗肉，开出真方卖假药，蒋介石把国民党的招牌卖倒了！孙中山先生的忠实信徒固然秉承着孙中山先生的主义继续不断地在国民党内作斗争，在中国进行革命。但一般人民由于怨恨反动统治就厌恶国民党，由于厌恶国民党，就忽视了孙中山先生的主义、学说和革命事业。这些事实就使社会上一些人对纪念孙中山先生这件事，不能完全认识它的真实意义。这些事实，也就说明了今天隆重地纪念孙中山先生的必要性和重要性。我们要通过这样的方式，使中国人民对历史上这个伟大革命家的人格、思想和功绩有真切的认识，使历史上一个伟大革命家的宝贵遗产能够世代流传下去。
    就我个人来说，1911年辛亥革命的时候，我还在童年，我当然没有幸运直接聆受这个伟大革命家的教诲。然而孙中山先生在我童年思想上所起的影响是很深刻的。从1911年10月起，我才开始听到“革命”“共和”“民主”“自由”“平等”这类名词，亦从那时候起直到今天我对孙中山先生始终一贯地表示深切的爱戴和崇高的敬意。在中国，像我这一辈年龄的人，我相信，孙中山先生的思想是有同样深刻影响的，对孙中山先生都是爱戴和敬仰的。
    我一生只远远地望见过孙中山先生一面。我没有参加过同盟会和国民党。但我对这位伟大革命家的人格、思想和事业是一向敬佩的。1925年我在美国留学，同时做中国留美学生会会长，当孙中山先生在北京逝世的消息传到美国的时候，我立即号召全体中国留美学生举行孙中山先生追悼会。我那时就认定孙中山先生的人格、思想和事业是将永垂不朽的，是中国人民应该学习的。最近邵力子先生从“中山丛书”中把我三十年前在孙中山先生追悼会中说的一段话抄写给我，话是
    这样：
    “先生学说，极有系统。三民主义集近代政治哲学之大成，五权宪法为不易发现之新理。先生政治哲学应与民约论、法意论同等看待。孙公立功立德，国人已经公认，至于立言，则俟其著作译成西文之后，西洋学术界即当与以位置”。
    我这段话对孙中山先生学说的赞誉是不够恰当的。卢梭的民约论，孟德斯鸠的法意论是法国革命前震动世界的政治哲学，他们推动了世界的民主革命。卢梭、孟德斯鸠是十八世纪世界民主革命的先进思想家。所以我把孙中山先生的革命思想同卢梭、孟德斯鸠相提并论。在今天看来，孙中山先生的民生主义，他晚年的“联俄、联共、扶助农工”“以俄为师”的社会主义革命思想比起卢梭、孟德斯鸠的进步思想来是更进一步的。用历史的眼光来回顾和衡量历史人物，毫无疑问，孙中山先生是中国历史上一个进步的政治家，伟大的革命家。他对中国人民革命、社会主义革命起了承先启后的重大作用。
    近来报纸杂志上发表关于孙中山先生的文章很多，对孙中山先生的人格、思想和事业有了详确的介绍。今天我只愿就孙中山先生“立言、立功、立德”的成就，说几点个人的体会。
    关于立言，孙中山先生在“中国革命史”中曾经说：“予之谋中国革命。其所持主义。有因袭吾国固有之思想。有规抚欧洲之学说事迹者。有吾所独见而创获者。”这几句话的确概括了孙中山先生全部思想学说的根源和体系。批评地接受祖国文化，审慎地吸收西洋文化，运用自己的独立思考，融会贯通，发扬光大，孙中山先生这种做学问的方法值得中国人民学习。
    关于立功，孙中山先生领导的辛亥革命是中国一个有伟大历史意义的事件。孙中山先生自己说：“荡涤二百六十余年之耻辱。使国内诸民族一切平等。”“铲除四千余年君主专制之迹。使民主政治。于以开始。”而革命结果之伟大，“洵足于中国历史上。大书特书。而百世皆蒙其利者也。”但孙中山先生功成不居，他不仅不以此自足自满，他再接再厉地继续进行革命，以求实现他全部崇高的政治理想。为了追求中国人民的自由平等，国家富强，人民康乐，世界大同的目的，孙中山先生对中国人民革命献出了自己的一切。孙中山先生的政治理想和革命方向随着时代的进展而发展。孙中山先生把革命进行到底的真挚与热诚，值得中国人民学习。
    关于立德，孙中山先生一生革命的经过是一部极其光荣的道德历史。他在四十年革命中表现了坚韧不移，百折不回，不怕艰难，不避危险的大无畏精神。辛亥革命是他在接连十次失败以后的成功。这一点就说明孙中山先生对革命具有伟大科学家在试验室里追求真理的决心与耐心。由于他有革命必定成功的坚强信心，他对失败就从来不灰心；由于他有革命必须彻底的卓越勇气，他对挫折就从来不丧气。他对党员的过错，知过即受包容；他对叛徒的罪恶，认罪即得宽恕。孙中山先生革命的动机是仁爱，因此，他是一位忘我的革命家；是一位“大公无私”的革命家；是一位“天下为公”的革命家。孙中山先生这种崇高伟大的人格，值得中国人民学习。
    为什么要纪念孙中山先生？因为中国人民要学习孙中山先生，要永远学习孙中山先生！
