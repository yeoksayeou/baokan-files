New Efforts to Strengthen Sino-Burmese Friendly Relations

　　Recently, an old friend of the Chinese people, U Nu, Chairman of the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League of the Union of Burma, was invited to visit China and received a warm welcome from the Chinese people. During his stay in China, Chairman U Nu and Premier Zhou Enlai held several talks in a friendly atmosphere on issues of common concern to China and Burma, especially the Sino-Burmese border issue. According to the joint press communiqué issued by China and Burma on the 9th, the Chinese side put forward fair and reasonable proposals during the talks for resolving the Sino-Burmese border issue, taking into account the interests of both sides. The Burmese side has agreed to consider this proposal. The governments of China and Burma have also reached an understanding that before the end of 1956, the Chinese army will withdraw from the area west of the 1941 line, and the Burmese army will withdraw from the three places of Pianma, Kangfang, and Gulang. This provides a favorable basis for resolving the Sino-Burmese border issue.
　　The Sino-Burmese border issue is a problem left over from history. The neighboring countries of China and Burma share rivers and mountains. The border line between the two countries is intertwined, and ethnic groups live together in a mixed pattern, making the situation relatively complex. Since the British imperialists conquered Burma by force in 1885, China and Britain have repeatedly negotiated on the issue of the Yunnan-Burma border. In some areas, the boundary has never been demarcated. In some areas, although there were agreements, formal boundary markers were not established. Therefore, the so-called Sino-Burmese border issue has a long history. Now that Burma has gained independence from British colonial rule, and China has also been liberated, the friendly relations between the two countries, based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, are developing day by day, and there are the best conditions for resolving the border issue. When Chairman U Nu visited China as Prime Minister of Burma in 1954, China and Burma agreed to properly resolve this issue through normal diplomatic channels at an appropriate time. Since then, China and Burma have maintained continuous contact.
　　Now, the talks between Chairman U Nu and Premier Zhou Enlai have paved the way for the resolution of the Sino-Burmese border issue. This is a new effort by China and Burma to consolidate and strengthen Sino-Burmese friendly relations. This proves that whatever problems may arise between us and our friends and neighbors, we are able to seek a fair and reasonable solution to both parties through friendly consultation. This also proves that China and Burma cherish the solidarity of Asian countries, because we all recognize that friendly cooperation between Asian countries is the most reliable guarantee for crushing imperialist conspiracies and ensuring peace in Asia.
　　We have reason to believe that on the basis of the talks between Chairman U Nu and Premier Zhou Enlai, the Sino-Burmese border issue will be resolved justly. The flower of friendship that has grown between China and Burma in the soil of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, with the careful care and cultivation of the politicians of the two countries, will bloom even more luxuriantly.

### 加强中缅友好关系的新努力

    加强中缅友好关系的新努力
    最近，中国人民的老朋友——缅甸联邦反法西斯人民自由同盟吴努主席应邀访问中国，受到了中国人民的热烈欢迎。在中国逗留期间，吴努主席和周恩来总理就中缅两国共同关心的问题，特别是中缅边境问题，在友好的气氛中进行了多次会谈。根据9日发表的中缅双方联合新闻公报，我国方面在会谈中曾就解决中缅边界问题提出了照顾双方利益的公平合理的建议。这项建议缅甸方面已经答应考虑。中缅两国政府并取得谅解，在1956年年底以前，中国军队将撤出1941年线以西地区，缅甸军队将撤出片马、岗房、古浪三个地方。这就为解决中缅边境问题提供了有利的基础。
    中缅边境问题是历史上遗留下来的问题。毗邻而居的中缅两国江河相通，山峦相接。两国的边境线犬牙交错，民族杂居，情况是比较复杂的。自1885年英帝国主义以武力征服缅甸以来，中英两国就滇缅界务问题多次交涉。其中有些地区，始终没有勘定边界。有些地区，虽有协议，没有确立正式界桩。因而所谓中缅边境问题，由来已久。现在缅甸已经摆脱英国的殖民统治而独立，中国也已经获得了解放，建立在和平共处五项原则基础上的两国的友好关系日益发展，解决边境问题就有了最好的条件。在1954年吴努主席以缅甸总理身份访问中国的时候，中缅双方就曾经同意在适当时期内通过正常的外交途径，妥善解决这一问题。以后中缅双方曾不断保持接触。
    现在，吴努主席和周恩来总理的会谈，已经为中缅边境问题的解决铺平了道路。这是中缅两国为巩固和加强中缅友好关系的新的努力。这证明了在我们和我们的朋友和邻居之间，无论发生什么问题，我们是能够通过友好协商，求得对双方公平合理的解决的。这也证明了，中缅两国是珍视亚洲国家的团结的，因为我们都认识到，亚洲国家之间的友好合作，是粉碎帝国主义阴谋、保证亚洲和平的最可靠的保证。
    我们有理由相信，在吴努主席和周恩来总理这次会谈的基础上，中缅边界问题将得到公正的解决。中缅两国之间在和平共处五项原则的土壤中所生长出来的友好之花，在两国政治家加意的爱护和培养之下，将要更加茂盛地开放。
