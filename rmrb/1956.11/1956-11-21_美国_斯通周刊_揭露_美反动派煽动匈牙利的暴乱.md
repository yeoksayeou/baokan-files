    U.S. "Stone Weekly" Reveals
    American Reactionaries Incited the Hungarian Uprising
    Xinhua News Agency, 20th dispatch from New York: The American liberal "Stone Weekly" revealed on November 19th the shameful criminal role played by "Voice of America," "Radio Free Europe," and the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency in the Hungarian counter-revolutionary rebellion.
    The publisher of this weekly, I.F. Stone, pointed out that the above three American agencies gave the Hungarian counter-revolutionaries various promises, but before these promises could be fulfilled, the Hungarian counter-revolutionary forces were defeated, and this American practice was therefore criticized by some people in Western Europe.
    Stone wrote: "'Chicago Tribune' reporter Larry Rue reported from Vienna on November 13th: 'People here accuse American propaganda of trying to incite anti-communist rebellions behind the Iron Curtain, rebellions that are doomed to failure in advance.'"
    Stone suggested that the U.S. Congress should investigate the activities of these three American agencies in the Hungarian event.

    美国“斯通周刊”揭露
    美反动派煽动匈牙利的暴乱
    据新华社20日讯　纽约消息：美国自由主义的“斯通周刊”11月19日揭露了“美国之音”、“自由欧洲电台”和美国中央情报局在匈牙利反革命叛乱中所扮演的可耻的罪犯角色。
    这家周刊的发行人斯通指出，以上三个美国机关给了匈牙利反革命分子以各种诺言，但是这些诺言还来不及兑现，匈牙利反革命势力就被击败了，美国的这种作法因而受到了西欧一些人士的指责。
    斯通写道：“‘芝加哥论坛报’记者拉里·鲁11月13日从维也纳报道说：‘这里的人士都指责美国的宣传的目的是企图在铁幕后面鼓动反共产党的叛乱，而这一种叛乱事先就注定要失败的。’”
    斯通建议美国国会应当对美国这三个机关在匈牙利事件中的活动进行调查。
