Britain and France Illegally Establish "Canal Clearance" Organization
Egypt Accuses Britain and France of Seeking Pretexts to Violate UN Resolutions

Xinhua News Agency, November 17th, Cairo Dispatch: An Egyptian official spokesman accused on the evening of the 16th that the British and French plan to "clear the canal" violates the relevant UN resolutions on the Suez Canal.

Hatem, Director of the Egyptian Government Information Department, issued a statement on the British and French plan saying: "Britain and France are today looking for excuses to violate UN resolutions and carry out aggression. Their previous foolish actions caused the suspension of navigation in the canal. British, French, and Israeli communiques have announced the bombing of military bridges over the canal by planes. These communiques also admitted to bombing Egyptian ships in the canal. If Britain and France are complaining today about the suspension of navigation, it is entirely due to their acts of aggression."

Xinhua News Agency, November 17th, Port Said Dispatch: British authorities announced on the 16th that Britain and France have established a joint command to be responsible for "clearing the Suez Canal." It also announced that the clearing work will be carried out from both ends of the canal.

British and French troops currently occupy only a small section of the Suez Canal. The majority of the canal remains under Egyptian control. Britain and France intend to use the name of clearing the canal to refuse to withdraw their troops and further seize the canal. The Egyptian government has stated its opposition to allowing Britain and France to carry out the so-called clearing work.

The British Foreign Secretary also revealed in New York on the 15th that Britain and France intend to use the UN Emergency Force to serve their conspiracy. (Attached photo)

    英法擅自成立“清理运河”机构
    埃及指责英法寻找违反联合国决议的借口
    据新华社17日讯　开罗消息：埃及官方发言人16日晚间指责说，英法“清理运河”的计划是违反联合国有关苏伊士运河的决议的。
    埃及政府情报司司长哈特姆就英法的计划发表声明说：“英法今天正在找寻借口来违反联合国决议，进行侵略。它们先前的愚蠢行动招致了运河航行的停止。英法和以色列的公报曾经宣布要用飞机炸毁架在运河上的军用桥梁。这些公报还承认了轰炸运河中的埃及船只。假如英国法国今天在抱怨航行停止了，那始终是由于他们的侵略行动造成的。”
    据新华社17日讯　塞得港消息：英国当局16日宣布，英法成立了一个联合指挥部来负责“清理苏伊士运河”。它还宣布，清理工作将从运河两端分头进行。
    英法军队目前只占领了苏伊士运河的一小段。运河的大部分仍在埃及自己的控制之下。英法打算借清理运河的名义，拒绝撤出军队并且进一步夺取这条运河。埃及政府曾经声明反对让英法进行所谓清理工作。
    英国外交大臣15日在纽约还透露出英法打算利用联合国紧急部队来为它们的阴谋服务。（附图片）
