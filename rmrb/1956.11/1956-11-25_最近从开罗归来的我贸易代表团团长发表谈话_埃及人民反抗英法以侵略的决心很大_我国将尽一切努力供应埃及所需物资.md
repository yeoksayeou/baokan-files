Xinhua News Agency, 24th: Jiang Ming, head of the Chinese trade delegation to Egypt and Deputy Minister of Foreign Trade, who recently returned from Cairo, told Xinhua News Agency reporters today: "China will do everything possible to fulfill the trade contracts signed with Egypt and continue to supply Egypt with needed materials."

On October 22nd, Jiang Ming, representing the Chinese government, signed a trade protocol worth 12 million pounds and a payment agreement with the Egyptian government in Cairo.

Jiang Ming said, "I was in Cairo until November 4th. Although British and French planes were bombing day and night at that time, there were no signs of chaos in Cairo. Even when British and French planes were circling and bombing, I saw that construction projects were still continuing without interruption."

He said, "The Egyptian people were very calm and not panicked. Prices did not fluctuate, and market trading activities continued as usual. Merchants did not take the opportunity to raise prices, and there were no signs of panic buying. In the struggle to resist Anglo-French-Israeli aggression, the people were very determined. Slogans such as 'Fight! Fight! Fight!' were hung in front of shops. I also saw many young people, workers, students, and shop assistants signing up to join the army. On the streets, you could see new soldiers wearing new uniforms being trained, and the people's morale was very high. Traffic in Cairo was also still normal. When I left, I saw that the order at the train station was very good."

Jiang Ming also emphasized, "The Egyptian people are full of confidence, and they trust their leader, President Nasser. They know that they are not isolated. They know that peace-loving people all over the world are standing by their side."

When talking about implementing the protocol for the second agreement year of the Sino-Egyptian trade agreement he signed in Cairo last month, Jiang Ming said that although there are some transportation difficulties at present, "we will try our best to find ways to transport the goods."

Jiang Ming concluded, "The Chinese government and the Chinese people are taking various measures to support Egypt. I personally witnessed the Egyptian people's heroic resistance to aggression. We believe that the Egyptian people's just struggle to defend the independence and freedom of their motherland will surely achieve final victory."

    最近从开罗归来的我贸易代表团团长发表谈话
    埃及人民反抗英法以侵略的决心很大  我国将尽一切努力供应埃及所需物资
    新华社24日讯　最近从开罗回来的中华人民共和国赴埃及贸易代表团团长、对外贸易部副部长江明今天对新华社记者说：“中国将尽一切努力履行同埃及签订的贸易合同并继续供应埃及所需物资。”
    上个月的22日，江明曾代表中国政府在开罗和埃及政府签订了一项价值一千二百万英镑的贸易议定书和一项支付协定。
    江明说，“11月4日以前，我还在开罗。当时虽然英法飞机日夜轰炸，但是开罗城没有混乱迹象。就是在英法飞机盘旋轰炸的时候，我看到建筑工程仍然在继续进行、没有停顿。”
    他说，“埃及人民很平静，并没有惊慌失措。物价没有波动，市场交易活动照常进行。商人们没有乘机抬高物价，也没有看到抢购的现象。在抵抗英法以侵略的斗争中，人民决心很大，店铺前都挂上写着‘战斗！战斗！战斗！’的标语。我还看到许多年青人、工人、学生和店员报名参军，在街道上就可以看见穿着新军装的新战士在受训，人民情绪十分高涨。开罗城的交通也仍然很正常，当我离开的时候，我看到火车站的秩序很好。”
    江明还强调说，“埃及人民是充满信心的，他们信任他们的领袖纳赛尔总统。他们知道他们不是孤立的，他们知道，全世界爱好和平的人民是站在他们一边的。”
    在谈到执行上个月他在开罗签订的中埃贸易协定第二个协定年度的议定书的时候，江明说，虽然目前运输上有些困难，“但是，我们将尽可能设法把货物运去。”
    江明最后说，“中国政府和中国人民正在采取各种措施支援埃及，我亲眼看见了埃及人民英勇抵抗侵略的行动，我们相信埃及人民保卫自己祖国的独立和自由的正义斗争，一定会取得最后胜利。”
