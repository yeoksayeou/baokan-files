Xinhua News Agency, 9th. Five disabled servicemen spoke at the National Conference of Active Elements of Martyrs' Families, Military Families, Disabled Servicemen, and Demobilized Servicemen in Socialist Construction on the 8th and 9th. They reported to the conference on the contributions they had made in various jobs after leaving the army, while maintaining and carrying forward the glorious traditions of revolutionary soldiers. Su Wenjie, a disabled soldier from Hebei Province, introduced at the meeting the process of overcoming difficulties and successfully developing a "steel bar automatic straightening, measuring, and cutting combined machine." In 1954, when Su Wenjie was working in the Taiyuan Thermal Power Plant, in order to reduce the labor intensity of workers straightening steel bars and improve work efficiency, he designed a blueprint for a machine that could automatically hammer the steel bars straight. However, when he submitted the design blueprint to the leadership for review, the leadership not only did not review it but also criticized him for "blind design." But Su Wenjie was not discouraged. He overcame many difficulties and persisted in trial production. Not knowing how to draw, he looked for reference books, learning and drawing at the same time. When he did not understand electrical technology, he used his spare time to ask electrical workers for advice. He failed more than a hundred times in the trial run. After failing, he often lay under the machine for several hours to find the cause of the failure. Thanks to his efforts, he finally received the support of the Party Committee of the Shijiazhuang Power Plant, and the "steel bar automatic straightening, measuring, and cutting combined machine" was finally successfully trial-produced in February this year. According to preliminary calculations, the production efficiency of this machine can be increased by more than thirty times compared with manual production, and the steel bars produced are completely up to quality standards.

Wang Cailian, a disabled soldier from Anhui Province, joined the New Fourth Army in 1945. He was seriously injured in combat with the enemy, which caused paralysis of his lower body and stiff fingers. After he was demobilized and returned to his hometown, he encountered many difficulties in production, but each difficulty was stubbornly overcome by him. He also actively participated in preferential treatment and public security work in his township. He has been successively rated as the county's special-class model of preferential treatment, first-class model of production and disaster relief, first-class model of anti-espionage, and first-class model of production. He was recently rated as the province's first-class model of preferential treatment and first-class model of production. In his speech, he said that these honors were given to him by the people. He will continue to maintain the honor of a soldier, do a good job, and strive to perform meritorious service in socialist construction.

Qu Zhanquan, a disabled soldier from Baotou City, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, has been rated as a first-class agricultural production model, afforestation model, and disabled soldier model in Baotou City seven times since leaving the army. He is now the director of the Jiefang Vegetable Garden Production Cooperative in Baotou City and the deputy secretary of the General Branch of the Donghe Township Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. In his speech, he focused on how he led the cooperative to break with conservative ideas and absorb advanced experience. When the cooperative he led first promoted the use of DDT to control pests, many members believed that spraying DDT delayed work and was useless. After he patiently persuaded them, he first conducted a test, and as a result, all the insects died. Then a wave of DDT spraying was set off, which resulted in a bumper harvest of 43 mu of "Ge Da Bai" cabbage in the whole cooperative. Many people in the cooperative led by Qu Zhanquan believed that densely planted "Ge Da Bai" would not grow well, so only eight seedlings were planted in each small ridge. After he saw the experience of dense planting in a Soviet pictorial, he decided to try planting five mu, increasing four seedlings per small ridge compared to the original. As a result, each mu could produce 6,700 catties of vegetables, an increase of 570 catties per mu compared to the past.

On the 8th and 9th, six other family members of martyrs, military dependents, and demobilized soldiers also spoke at the conference.

On the morning of the 9th, the activists also listened to a report on industrial construction issues by Xue Muqiao, Deputy Director of the State Planning Commission.

    在全国烈属、军属、残废军人、复员军人积极分子会上
    五名残废军人报告了模范事迹
    新华社9日讯　全国烈属、军属、残废军人、复员军人社会主义建设积极分子大会在8、9两日有五名残废军人在大会上发言。他们向大会汇报了他们离开部队以后，保持和发扬革命军人的光荣传统，在各项工作中所做出的贡献。河北省残废军人苏文杰在会上介绍了他克服困难试制成功“钢筋自动直、量、切联合机”的经过。1954年苏文杰在太原热电厂工作时，为了想减轻工人砸直钢筋的劳动强度，提高工作效率，曾经设计一个能把钢筋自动锤直的机器草图。但是当他把设计草图请领导上审查时，领导上不但不给他审查，还批评他是“盲目设计”。但是苏文杰并不灰心，他克服了许多困难，坚持试制工作。他不懂得怎样绘图，就去找参考书，边学边绘，不懂电气技术时就利用业余时间向电工师傅请教。在试车中他失败了一百多次。他在失败以后，常在机器下面躺了几个小时去找失败的原因。由于他的种种努力，最后得到石家庄电厂党委会的支持，“钢筋自动直、量、切联合机”终于在今年2月间试制成功了。据初步计算，用这部机器生产比人工生产的工作效率可以提高到三十倍以上，生产出来的钢筋完全合乎质量。
    安徽省残废军人王彩连，1945年参加新四军，因与敌人作战负了重伤，使他下身瘫痪、手指僵直。他复员回乡后，在生产中碰到不少困难，但是每个困难都被他顽强地克服了。他在乡里还积极参加优抚和治安工作。他曾先后被评为县的特等优抚模范、一等生产救灾模范、一等防奸模范和一等生产模范。最近又被评为省的一等优抚模范和一等生产模范。他在发言中说，这些荣誉都是人民群众给他的。他今后要继续保持军人的荣誉，做好工作，争取在社会主义建设中立功。
    内蒙古自治区包头市的残废军人屈占泉在离开部队以后，曾经七次被评为包头市一级农业生产模范、植树造林模范和残废军人模范。现在他担任包头市解放菜园生产合作社主任和中共包头东河乡总支部副书记。他在发言中着重讲到他如何领导合作社打破保守思想，吸取先进经验的情况。他领导的合作社最初推广使用滴滴涕防治虫害时，许多社员认为打滴滴涕误工、不中用，经他耐心说服，先作了试验，结果虫子全部死光了。接着就掀起了打滴滴涕的热潮，使全社四十三亩“圪?白”菜获得丰收。屈占泉领导的合作社里有很多人认为密种的“圪?白”长不好，因此每个小畦只栽八棵苗。他在苏联画报上看到密种的经验后，就决定试种五亩，每个小畦比原来增加四棵苗。结果每亩能产六千七百斤菜，比过去每亩产量增加五百七十斤。
    8、9两日在大会上发言的还有六名烈属、军属和复员军人。
    9日上午，积极分子们还听了国家计划委员会副主任薛暮桥作的关于工业建设问题的报告。
