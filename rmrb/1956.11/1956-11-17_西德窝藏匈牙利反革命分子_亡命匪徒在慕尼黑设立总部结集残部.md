    West Germany Shelters Hungarian Counterrevolutionaries
    Fugitive Bandits Establish Headquarters in Munich to Gather Remnants
    Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 16th. According to a report by the German News Agency: Hungarian counterrevolutionaries have already established a headquarters in Munich (the American radio station "Radio Free Europe," which is responsible for carrying out slander and incitement against socialist countries, is also located in Munich). Three counterrevolutionaries who fled from Hungary are responsible for the work of this headquarters. With the permission of the Adenauer authorities, they held a press conference in Munich on November 14th, but they did not reveal their names.
    They said that they had received orders to gather so-called "insurgents" and establish "a kind of exile representation." These orders were issued by a leader of this counterrevolutionary rebellion, Colonel Márián, the former Deputy Minister of Defense of the Nagy cabinet. In addition, they were also instructed to urge the West to "morally and diplomatically support" the counterrevolutionaries.

    西德窝藏匈牙利反革命分子
    亡命匪徒在慕尼黑设立总部结集残部
    新华社柏林16日电　据德意志通讯社报道：匈牙利的反革命分子已经在慕尼黑建立了总部（负责进行污蔑和煽动反对社会主义国家的行动的美国电台“自由欧洲”广播电台也是设在慕尼黑）。从匈牙利逃出的三个反革命分子负责这个总部的工作，他们在阿登纳当局的允许下，11月14日在慕尼黑举行了记者招待会，但是他们没有透露他们的名字。
    他们说，他们接到的命令是结集所谓“起义分子”，并且成立“一种流亡代表机构”。这些命令是由这次反革命叛乱的一个领袖、前纳吉内阁的国防部副部长马里安上校发出的。此外，他们还受命促使西方“在道义上和外交上支持”反革命分子。
