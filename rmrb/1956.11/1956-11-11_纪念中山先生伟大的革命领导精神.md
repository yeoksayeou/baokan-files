    I am a former member of the Chinese Kuomintang and a member of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang after liberation. I was influenced by Mr. Sun Yat-sen's revolution from a young age, personally listened to Mr. Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary guidance, and was commissioned by Mr. Sun Yat-sen for revolutionary tasks. I would like to make a recollection of my own experiences and commemorate Mr. Sun Yat-sen's ninetieth birthday with fervent emotion.
    During the late Qing Dynasty, Guangxi established a New Army and set up a Directorate of Military Training, attracting many officers from other provinces. Some were graduates of Japanese military academies, and some were domestic military students. At the time, young people particularly admired the Japanese military academy graduates, believing that they had been baptized by Mr. Sun Yat-sen's revolution in Japan and were revolutionaries. Influenced by this, I entered the Army Primary School in the second year of the Xuantong reign. It was said that the Tongmenghui planned to launch an uprising in Guangxi at that time. Therefore, many revolutionary figures gathered in Guilin, and a revolutionary atmosphere permeated the city. In the Army Primary School, we formed a sworn alliance of ten young comrades, determined to make revolution. As far as I know, similar organizations existed in various schools, but we had not yet established direct organizational ties with the Tongmenghui. All of this was a result of being influenced by Mr. Sun Yat-sen's revolution.
    The sound of the Wuchang Uprising echoed throughout the country, and Guangxi quickly responded by declaring independence. After Guangxi's independence, it immediately organized the Northern Expeditionary Army, composed of the Guangxi Student Army Dare-to-Die Corps and the Guangxi New Army Mixed Brigade (i.e., Mixed Brigade). They swore an oath in Guilin, led by Brigade Commander Zhao Hengti, and set off. I was a squad leader in the Guangxi Student Army Dare-to-Die Corps and participated in the Northern Expedition of the 1911 Revolution.
    The Guangxi Northern Expeditionary Army passed through Hengyang and Changsha, crossed Dongting Lake, and reached Jinkou Town, sixty miles upstream of Wuchang. At that time, the Qing army was launching a major southward offensive, and Hankou and Hanyang were successively lost after fierce battles. Although the situation in Wuchang was quite critical, the revolutionary situation developed even further. Nanjing was recovered, and Mr. Sun Yat-sen and Mr. Huang Keqiang (Xing) returned from overseas to Wuchang and Nanjing one after another. Revolutionaries from all over the country received abundant spiritual sustenance from Mr. Sun Yat-sen, which was equivalent to the reinforcement of a million fresh troops. Courage was multiplied, and provinces declared independence one after another, sending representatives to Nanjing to organize a government. The Provisional Government of the Republic of China was established in Nanjing.
    Later, Mr. Sun Yat-sen resigned from the position of Provisional President, and power was usurped by Yuan Shikai. Yuan Shikai was a counter-revolutionary. He co-opted and supported those Qing Dynasty officials who had declared independence, attacked or bought off revolutionaries, reorganized and reduced revolutionary armies, and vigorously expanded his own reactionary troops. As Yuan Shikai's imperial ambitions were exposed, Mr. Sun Yat-sen called for the suppression of Yuan, launching the Second Revolution. The suppression of Yuan appeared to be a failure on the surface, but Yuan Shikai's dream of becoming emperor was shattered.
    In 1920, the Guangdong Army returned to Guangdong to expel the Guangxi warlords entrenched there, and Mr. Sun Yat-sen returned to Guangdong to reorganize the military government. In 1921, troops were sent to Guangxi to suppress Lu Rongting (as far as I know, Lu Rongting launched an offensive against Guangdong in three routes first), occupying Wuzhou, Guilin, Liuzhou, and Nanning. We rose up in Baise and returned to the revolutionary ranks. That winter, Mr. Sun Yat-sen went to Guilin to organize the General Headquarters and prepare for the Northern Expedition. Later, Chen Jiongming opposed the Northern Expedition, and the Guangdong Army was withdrawn from Guangxi. Guangxi was then controlled by the remnants of Lu Rongting's forces. We fought alone and transferred over a thousand miles before breaking through the encirclement and trying to get in touch with the revolutionary army. At that time, the war to suppress Chen Jiongming had not yet ended, and Mr. Sun Yat-sen was supervising the battle in Shilong (a station on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway). We sent Bai Chongxi and Chen Jiefu as representatives to pay respects to Mr. Sun Yat-sen and express our revolutionary sincerity. Mr. Sun Yat-sen immediately issued a hand-signed order as Grand Marshal, appointing me as the Commander-in-Chief of the Guangxi Anti-Bandit Army. This was the first time I received Mr. Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary commission. In 1923, our army joined forces with Comrade Li Jishen, commander of the First Division of the Guangdong Army, and occupied Wuzhou.
    Although we made some progress in Wuzhou, the enemy's forces were very large, and our strength was still very weak. I went to Guangzhou to pay respects to Mr. Sun Yat-sen, seeking instructions on revolutionary strategy and requesting assistance. Mr. Liao Zhongkai was very concerned about us, and in the past, many matters were negotiated with him. I first met Mr. Zhongkai, who introduced me to Mr. Sun Yat-sen at the Henan Cement Factory (the General Headquarters at the time). He was wearing a Zhongshan suit, and his attitude was amiable and serious. I gave a brief report on the anti-bandit campaign and requested instructions and assistance. Mr. Zhongkai also added some supplementary explanations. He was quite pleased after listening to my report. I still remember his great instructions. He said: "Revolutionaries should not rely on anything. Everything must be created and developed by ourselves. Revolutionary ideology, revolutionary spirit, and revolutionary party members are the source of all the Party's strength. Since you are determined to participate in the revolution, you must first understand this principle. Other issues can be discussed with Mr. Liao." After hearing these great instructions, I said goodbye to Mr. Liao and withdrew. This was the first time I met Mr. Sun Yat-sen, and it was also the last time I met Mr. Sun Yat-sen. After that, Mr. Sun Yat-sen went north and passed away in Beijing, and there was never another opportunity to meet him again. Recalling the past, I cannot help but feel sorrow! I personally listened to Mr. Sun Yat-sen's great revolutionary guidance, and based on his guidance, I did my best to create and develop. Especially after the First National Congress of the Chinese Kuomintang, the reorganization of the Kuomintang was implemented, a declaration was issued, and the three major policies of alliance with Russia, alliance with the Communist Party, and assistance to farmers and workers were established. This improved our understanding and practice of the revolution. In a short period of time, Guangxi wiped out the remaining warlords in the entire province and was completely unified under the revolutionary government.
    Although Mr. Sun Yat-sen passed away, China's revolutionary cause has continued to develop, following the three major policies he established. In 1926, the Northern Expeditionary Revolutionary Army rapidly and victoriously reached Wuhan and occupied Nanjing, Shanghai, and the provinces along the Yangtze River. During this stage, I personally witnessed the great spiritual and material assistance that the Soviet Union provided to China, the sincere cooperation and selfless struggle of the Communist Party members and Kuomintang members, and the great strength exerted by the workers and peasants. Now I even more deeply realize that the rapid and smooth development of the Great Revolution was not simply a matter of military strength, but rather the result of correctly implementing Mr. Sun Yat-sen's three major policies. If Mr. Sun Yat-sen were still alive, the three major policies would definitely be thoroughly implemented, and the Great Revolution might have succeeded smoothly. He would definitely lead China to develop on the road to socialism, and China's international status and people's lives would be improved even more with the times. It would also not have caused many Kuomintang members to take dark detours or still be on dark roads today. The Chinese Communist Party has always respected Mr. Sun Yat-sen's great personality and revolutionary cause. When the entire country holds grand commemorations for Mr. Sun Yat-sen's ninetieth birthday, it is precisely when the motherland is carrying out socialist construction under the leadership of the Communist Party and achieving victory step by step. China's construction has already greatly exceeded Mr. Sun Yat-sen's ideals at the time. Mr. Sun Yat-sen's spirit in heaven can be comforted, and it is also something that any Kuomintang member should deeply reflect on in addition to being grateful. I think that the Kuomintang members in Taiwan are also commemorating Mr. Sun Yat-sen's ninetieth birthday with the same enthusiasm, and they will also recall Mr. Sun Yat-sen's three major policies and the ideals of his great cause. I sincerely hope that under Chairman Mao's great call for long-term coexistence and mutual supervision between the democratic parties, they will, in the spirit of patriotism and unity, cooperate again and jointly complete the complete reunification of the motherland!

    纪念中山先生伟大的革命领导精神
    黄绍竑
    我是以前的中国国民党党员，是解放后中国国民党革命委员会的成员，我从小就受到中山先生革命的影响，曾经面聆过中山先生的革命指导，受过中山先生的革命委任。我想就自己所经过的作一番回忆，用热烈的心情来纪念中山先生的九十诞辰。
    前清末年，广西创办新军，设立督练公所，来了很多外省的军官。其中有些是日本陆军士官学生，有些是国内陆军学生。当时的青年们对日本士官学生特别景仰，认为是在日本受过中山先生革命的洗礼的，他们是革命的。我受了这个影响于宣统二年考入了陆军小学。据说，当时同盟会计划要在广西起义。因此许多革命人物聚集桂林，革命空气弥漫了桂林城。陆军小学里，我们结合十个小同志歃血为盟决心革命。据我所知类似这样的组织各学校都有，但我们还没有与同盟会发生直接的组织关系，这些都是受中山先生革命的影响而产生的。
    武昌革命起义的炮声响彻了全国，广西很快响应宣布独立。广西独立后随即组织北伐军出师北伐，广西的青年在一个星期内就组成了广西学生军敢死队和广西的新军混成协（即混成旅）一道由协统（即旅长）赵恒惕率领在桂林誓师出发，我就是广西学生军敢死队的一名小班长，参加了辛亥革命的北伐战争。
    广西北伐军经过衡阳、长沙渡过洞庭湖，到达武昌上游六十里的金口镇，那时正值清军大举南下，汉口、汉阳经过剧烈的争夺战后相继失守。武昌方面虽颇危急，但革命的局势则更为发展，南京光复了，中山先生和黄克强（兴）先生先后由海外回国到了武昌和南京。全国各地的革命者获得了中山先生丰富的精神接济，就等于百万生力大军的增援，勇气百倍，各省纷纷宣布独立，并派代表到南京组织政府，中华民国临时政府在南京成立。
    以后中山先生辞去临时大总统的职位，政权就被袁世凯所篡夺了。袁世凯是反革命的，他对于那些宣布独立的清朝大吏加以笼络扶植，对于革命党人加以打击或收买，对革命军队加以改编收缩，对自己的反动部队力加扩充。随着袁世凯帝制阴谋的暴露，中山先生乃号召讨袁，作第二次革命。讨袁表面看是失败的，但袁世凯的皇帝梦被粉碎了。
    1920年粤军回粤驱逐盘据广东的广西军阀，中山先生回粤重整军政府。1921年出兵广西讨伐陆荣廷（据我所知系陆荣廷先发动分三路向广东进攻）占领梧州、桂林、柳州、南宁，我们在百色起义重新归到革命的队伍里来。这年的冬天中山先生到桂林组织大本营筹备北伐，后因陈炯明反对北伐，把粤军撤出广西，广西遂为陆荣廷余部所控制。我们孤军奋斗转战千余里，才突出重围，设法与革命军取得连络。那时讨伐陈炯明的战争尚未结束，中山先生正在石龙（广九路上一个车站）督战，我们派白崇禧、陈杰夫为代表晋谒中山先生，表达我们革命的诚意。中山先生即用大元帅的手令亲笔委我为广西讨贼军总指挥，这是我第一次接受中山先生革命的委任。1923年我军与粤军第一师师长李济深同志会师占领梧州。
    我们在梧州虽获得一些进展，但敌人的势力很大，我们的力量尚很薄弱，我到广州晋谒中山先生，请示革命的方略和请求接济。廖仲恺先生是非常关心我们的，以前很多事情都是向他交涉。我首先见仲恺先生，由他介绍在河南士敏土厂（当年的大本营）见了中山先生，他着中山装，态度和蔼严肃。我将讨贼经过作概要的报告，并请求指示与接济，仲恺先生并加以补充说明。他听了我的报告颇为欣慰，我至今记得他伟大的指示。他说：“革命党是不要一切凭借的，一切都要自家去创造，自家去发展。革命主义、革命精神、革命党员就是本党一切力量的源泉。你们既决心参加革命，首先要明白这个道理，其余的问题可与廖先生去商量。”我听了这伟大的指示就与廖先生兴辞退出。这就是我第一次谒见中山先生的情形，也就是我最后一次谒见中山先生的情形，此后中山先生就北上在北京逝世永无再见的机会。追怀往事不禁慨然！我面聆了中山先生伟大的革命指导，本着他的指导尽自己的努力去创造发展，尤其在中国国民党第一次全国代表大会，实行改组国民党发表宣言，确定联俄、联共、扶助农工三大政策之后，使我们对于革命提高了认识和实践，广西就在不久的时间内将全省残余的军阀肃清，完全统一于革命政府之下。
    中山先生虽然逝世了，但中国的革命事业遵循着他所确定的三大政策而更加发展了。1926年北伐革命军迅速地、胜利地到达武汉占领南京、上海长江沿岸各省。在这个阶段里，我亲自看到苏联给中国的精神和物质的伟大援助，共产党人和国民党人的精诚合作忘我奋斗，工人和农民所发挥的伟大力量。现在更体会到大革命之所以能够迅速顺利地发展，决不是单纯的军事力量，而是正确地执行中山先生三大政策的结果。假如中山先生还健在的话，三大政策必能贯彻到底，大革命可能顺利地成功。他必定领导中国向社会主义的道路上发展，中国的国际地位和人民生活将随着时代而更为提高，也不致使很多国民党人走黑暗的弯路或至今尚在黑暗的道路上。中国共产党对中山先生的伟大人格和革命事业一向是崇敬的，当中山先生九十诞辰全国举行隆重的纪念的时候，正是祖国在共产党领导下进行社会主义建设步步胜利的时候。中国建设已经大大超过中山先生当时的理想，中山先生在天之灵是可以告慰的，也是任何一个国民党人在感谢之余所应深省的。我想在台湾的国民党人也正在同样地、热烈地纪念中山先生的九十诞辰，也一定会追怀中山先生的三大政策和伟大事业的理想，我诚恳地希望他们在毛主席各民主党派长期共存相互监督伟大号召之下，本着爱国一家的精神重新合作共同完成祖国的完全统一吧！
