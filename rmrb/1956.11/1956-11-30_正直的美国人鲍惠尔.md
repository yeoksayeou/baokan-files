    The Honest American, Powell

    Powell, who is being persecuted in the United States, is an honest, peace-loving, and freedom-loving American patriot citizen.

    Powell was born in China and studied in the United States from an early age. During World War II, he inherited his father's business and served as editor-in-chief of the Shanghai "Millard's Review" until 1953. Powell's father founded this newspaper in Shanghai in 1917. From its founding until Powell himself was the editor-in-chief, this newspaper was published in China for a full thirty-five years. Its main content was to introduce the situation in China and to comment on current affairs. Because it adhered to the principles of reporting facts and open commentary, it enjoyed a high reputation internationally and was welcomed by a wide readership at home and abroad.

    Unlike those greedy bloodsuckers and adventurers, Powell and his father had good feelings towards China and a sense of honest responsibility for their work. Powell's father was arrested, imprisoned, and persecuted by the Japanese invading army for supporting China's resistance against Japan. He finally died of illness not long after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War.

    After taking over the "Millard's Review," Powell published many condemning comments on the corruption and incompetence of Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary regime and the United States' overbearing interference in China's internal affairs.

    After the founding of the People's Republic of China, the "Millard's Review" introduced the situation of the new China to the American public and advocated that the United States should recognize the People's Republic of China and abandon the attempt to obstruct the restoration of our country's legitimate rights in the United Nations.

    During the US-initiated war of aggression against Korea, the "Millard's Review" made detailed exposures and comments on the inhuman crimes committed by the United States, such as germ warfare and the use of napalm bombs against Korean residents, believing that this behavior of the United States was unjust, unforgivable, and should be stopped.

    In October 1952, Powell and his wife, along with their colleague Schumann, attended the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference held in Beijing.

    Powell's words and deeds in China stemmed solely from the belief that the people of China and the United States could and should live peacefully together on the basis of mutual respect. He opposed any aggression and loved peace, and therefore has always been a critic of US policy toward China. However, it was precisely because of this that Powell angered the US ruling group.

    The US government banned the "Millard's Review" from being sent to the United States. Due to the loss of a large number of readers and economic difficulties, the newspaper had to cease publication automatically. At this time, Powell could not have been unaware of what the consequences would be of returning to the United States, but he loved truth and also loved his country, and he decided to return home. He said:

    "I am returning to the United States because I am an American, and the United States is my homeland."

    However, the saying "Everyone says their hometown is good," which is popular on the American continent, does not apply to Powell and his associates. In August 1953, as soon as he set foot in Hong Kong, he was "visited" by agents of the US Central Intelligence Agency. He was warned that "as an American citizen" it was his "responsibility to be careful to collect all information of military significance," not only to provide information about China, but also to pretend to be a technical expert after returning to the United States and infiltrate progressive groups to do despicable espionage work. Powell refused to accept such a "responsibility," and so "certain charges" were waiting for him.

    As soon as Powell and his wife arrived in San Francisco, the persecution against them officially began. Their personal collection of books, clippings, notebooks, photographs, Chinese antiques, British musician records, etc., were confiscated. Customs told him that the law prohibits the import of any Chinese-printed publications, but what about the "New Testament" and Hardy's novels, which are printed in the United States? The answer was, "The New Testament has been to China." What Powell found particularly surprising was that the confiscated collection of books was the remnant of the collection that his father had been confiscated by the Japanese after the Pearl Harbor Incident because it was considered "incendiary."

    Because he did not yield and insisted on his views on China, Powell fell into unemployment and economic hardship. Even his wife, Sylvia Kahn Powell, was fired by the Polio Foundation.

    In September 1954, the US Senate Internal Security Subcommittee began to subpoena Powell. They falsely accused Powell of "treason" and gave him all kinds of endless threats. On March 20, 1955, the subcommittee issued a report on the interrogation of Powell, falsely accusing him of having "unspeakable acts of betraying American interests in the Far East." The so-called "acts of betraying American interests in the Far East" refers to the fact that the "Millard's Review," edited by Powell, published articles about the truth of the Korean War, that he personally passed on messages to American prisoners of war in Korea and their families, and that after returning to the United States, he continued to introduce the facts of the new China to the American people and continued to criticize the US government's policy toward China.

    On April 25, 1956, before a grand jury in San Francisco, Powell was charged with so-called "seditious conspiracy."

    However, neither the McCarthyist persecution by the FBI and the subcommittee, nor the unreasonable trials by the courts, could make Powell and his associates abandon their conscience. They firmly defended their democratic and free rights in the face of persecutors. On September 6 of this year, they asked the court to dismiss the unreasonable charges against them. They demanded that if the trial were to continue, the government should allow them to present witnesses regarding the US germ warfare in Korea and China, and that the government should bear the expenses required to bring the witnesses to the United States.

    The US Federal Court issued an order on October 5, ordering Powell and others to submit the testimony of fifteen witnesses within forty-five days, with the expenses paid by the government.

    Powell is able to obtain the required witnesses. The Committee to Support "Millard's Review" Editor Powell, which was recently established in Beijing, announced that there are fifty Chinese witnesses willing to go to San Francisco, USA to testify in court.

    正直的美国人鲍惠尔
    正在美国受到迫害的鲍惠尔，是一个正直的爱好和平和自由的美国爱国公民。
    鲍惠尔生在中国，从小在美国学习，第二次世界大战期间继承父业，主编上海“密勒氏评论报”，直到1953年为止。1917年鲍惠尔的父亲在上海创办这个报刊，直到鲍惠尔本人的主编，这个报刊在中国足足发行了三十五年。其主要内容是介绍中国情况，并对时事问题发表评论，由于它坚持报道事实与公开评论的原则，在国际上很有声誉，得到中外广大读者的欢迎。
    鲍惠尔父子同那些贪婪的吸血鬼和冒险家不同，他们对中国抱有善良的感情，对自己的工作有着正直的责任感。鲍惠尔的父亲由于支持中国抗战，遭到日本侵略军的逮捕、监禁和迫害，终于在抗战胜利后不久就病逝。
    鲍惠尔接办了“密勒氏评论报”后，对蒋介石反动政权的腐败和无能、美国对中国内政的蛮横干涉，发表过不少谴责性的评论。
    中华人民共和国成立后，“密勒氏评论报”向美国公众介绍了新中国的情况，主张美国应当承认中华人民共和国，放弃阻挠恢复我国在联合国合法权利的勾当。
    在美国发动侵朝战争时期，“密勒氏评论报”对于美国进行细菌战和对朝鲜居民使用凝固汽油弹等惨无人道的罪恶行为，作过详细的揭露和评论，认为美国这种行为是不义的，不可饶恕的，应该予以制止。
    1952年10月，鲍惠尔夫妇和他们的同事舒曼一同出席了在北京举行的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议。
    鲍惠尔在中国的言行，仅仅是从这样的信念出发，即中美两国人民能够而且应当在彼此尊重的基础上和平相处。他反对任何侵略，爱好和平，因而一直是美国对华政策的批评者。但是，正是因为这样，鲍惠尔触怒了美国统治集团。
    美国政府禁止“密勒氏评论报”寄往美国。由于失掉广大读者与经济上的困难，该报不得不自动停刊。这时，鲍惠尔不会不知道回到美国会有什么结果，但他爱真理，也爱祖国，他还是决定回国。他这样说：
  “我回美国去，因为我是美国人，美国是我的祖国”。
    但是，在美洲大陆流行的“人人都说老家好”的俗语，对鲍惠尔他们却是不适用的。1953年8月，当他还刚刚踏上香港，就受到美国中央情报局特务的“访问”。他被警告说，“作为一个美国公民的责任”，是“要注意搜集一切有军事意义的资料”，不仅要他提供关于中国的情报，还要他在回到美国后作一个伪装的技术人员，混到进步团体里去作卑鄙的特务工作。鲍惠尔拒绝接受这样一个“责任”，于是，“某些控告”就等着他了。
    鲍惠尔夫妇一到旧金山，对他们的迫害就正式开始。他们携带的私人藏书、剪报、笔记本、照片、中国古玩、英国音乐家的唱片等，被没收了。海关对他说，法律禁止任何中国印的印刷品进口，但“新约圣经”及哈代的小说是美国印的，又怎么说呢？回答是，“新约到过中国”。使鲍惠尔特别感到意外的是，被没收的藏书是他父亲在珍珠港事变后被日本人认为“带煽动性”而加以没收的藏书的残余。
    由于他并不屈服，坚持对中国的见解，鲍惠尔陷于失业和经济困难的境地。连他的妻子锡尔维亚·坎·鲍惠尔也被小儿麻痹基金会解雇了。
    1954年9月，美国参议院国内安全小组委员会开始传讯鲍惠尔。诬控鲍惠尔以“叛国罪”，给他以种种无休止的威胁。这个小组委员会在1955年3月20日发表了一份对鲍惠尔的侦讯情况报告，诬蔑他有“不堪言状出卖美国在远东的事业的行为”。所谓“出卖美国在远东的事业的行为”，就是指鲍惠尔主编的“密勒氏评论报”发表了朝鲜战争的真相的文章，他本人为在朝鲜的美国战俘和他们的家庭传递了消息，以及他回到美国后，仍然向美国人民介绍了新中国实况并且继续批评了美国政府的对华政策。
    1956年4月25日，在旧金山大陪审团面前，鲍惠尔被控犯有所谓“煽动叛乱罪”。
    但是，无论是联邦调查局和小组委员会的麦卡锡主义迫害，或是法院的无理审讯，都不能使鲍惠尔他们放弃自己的良知，他们在迫害者面前坚决维护民主自由权利。今年9月6日，他们要求法院取消对他们的无理指控。他们要求：如果要继续进行审讯的话，政府应批准他们提出关于美国在朝鲜和中国进行的细菌战的见证人，并由政府担负把见证人带到美国所需的用费。
    美国联邦法院在10月5日发出命令，要鲍惠尔等在四十五天之内提出十五名见证人的证词，经费由政府支付。
    鲍惠尔是能够取得所要求的见证人的。不久在北京成立的声援“密勒氏评论报”编辑鲍惠尔委员会就宣布了有五十个中国证人愿意去美国旧金山出庭作证。
