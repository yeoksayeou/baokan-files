Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 16th. According to a report by the Czechoslovak News Agency on the 14th, the Hungarian Revolutionary Worker-Peasant Government sent a telegram to the UN Secretary-General, reiterating its opposition to the efforts by certain delegations within the United Nations to force a special session of the UN General Assembly to discuss the so-called Hungarian question. It also pointed out that such activities are an attempt to divert world public opinion from the Anglo-French-Israeli aggression against Egypt.

The Hungarian Revolutionary Worker-Peasant Government issued the following statement regarding the activities of these delegations: The Hungarian government believes that only the Hungarian and Soviet governments are qualified to negotiate on the issue of the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Hungary. The Hungarian government also refuses any other demands that fall entirely within the jurisdiction of the Hungarian authorities.

The statement said that, on the other hand, the Hungarian government is satisfied with the resolution of the UN General Assembly on assisting the Hungarian people. At the same time, the Hungarian government is willing to cooperate with the UN agencies and will continue to negotiate within this scope on the participation of UN representatives in activities to assist Hungary.

Xinhua News Agency, 16th, New York Dispatch: The Hungarian delegation to the UN General Assembly announced on the 15th that the Acting Foreign Minister of the Hungarian government, Mr. Sebes, has written to the UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld, stating that the Hungarian government's representatives are willing to meet with him in Rome to discuss the UN's proposal to provide assistance to Hungary.

The letter also stated that the Hungarian representatives will express to Hammarskjöld the Hungarian government's attitude towards the resolutions passed by the UN General Assembly emergency session on the so-called Hungarian question.

    新华社布拉格16日电　据捷克斯洛伐克通讯社14日报道，匈牙利工农革命政府致电联合国秘书长，再次表示反对联合国中某些代表团强使联合国举行联合国大会特别会议讨论所谓匈牙利问题，并且指出，这种活动是企图转移世界舆论对英、法、以侵略埃及的注意。
    匈牙利工农革命政府就这些代表团的活动发表声明如下：匈牙利政府认为，只有匈牙利和苏联两国政府才有资格就有关苏联部队撤出匈牙利的问题进行谈判。匈牙利政府也同样拒绝对于完全属于匈牙利当局权限以内的其他要求。
    声明说，另一方面，匈牙利政府对联合国全体会议关于援助匈牙利人民的决议表示满意。同时，匈牙利政府愿意同联合国的机构进行合作，并在这一范围内继续就联合国代表参加援助匈牙利的活动的问题进行谈判。
    新华社16日讯　纽约消息：出席联合国大会的匈牙利代表团15日宣布，匈牙利政府代理外交部长谢贝什已经写信给联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德，表示匈牙利政府的代表愿意和他在罗马会见，讨论联合国建议给予匈牙利援助的问题。
    这封信还说，匈牙利的代表将对哈马舍尔德表明匈牙利政府对联合国大会紧急会议就所谓匈牙利问题通过的决议所采取的态度。
