    Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 16th. The six rural work teams recently organized by the Guangxi Provincial Party Committee have already departed. These work teams will go to the rural areas of each special zone and the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Prefecture to assist local Party and government leading organs in promoting various tasks.
    These work teams are composed of 360 cadres drawn from various departments directly under the Guangxi Province.
    At present, rural Guangxi is carrying out autumn distribution and winter production. This year, although Guangxi Province had increased summer harvests, autumn crops suffered severe drought, and harvests were poor. According to relevant departments' estimates, under the best circumstances, this year's total grain output can only maintain last year's level, and rural sideline production has not recovered to last year's level either. Before the work teams went to the countryside, Wu Jinnan, Deputy Secretary of the Guangxi Provincial Party Committee, gave a report to all the cadres going to the countryside, especially emphasizing doing a good job in winter production and grain unified purchase and sales to prevent spring famine from occurring next year.

    广西省委派出六个工作组下乡
    协助推动冬季生产和粮食工作
    新华社南宁16日电　中共广西省委最近组织的六个农村工作队已经出发。这些工作队将分别到各专区和桂西僮族自治州农村，协助当地党政领导机关推动各项工作。
    这些工作队是由广西省直属各机关抽调的三百六十个干部组成的。
    目前广西省农村正在进行秋季分配和冬季生产。今年，广西省夏收作物虽然增产，但秋季作物遭受严重的干旱，收成不好，据有关部门估计，今年粮食总产量在最好的情况下，也只能保持去年的水平，农村副业生产也没有恢复到去年的水平。在工作队下乡以前，中共广西省委副书记伍晋南曾经向全体下乡干部作了报告，特别强调搞好冬季生产和粮食统购统销工作，以防止明年发生春荒。
