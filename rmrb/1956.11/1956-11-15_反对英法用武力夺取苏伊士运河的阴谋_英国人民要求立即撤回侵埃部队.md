Xinhua News Agency, London, November 14th: Our correspondents Peng Di and Qian Xing report: The British and French governments have no intention of abandoning their conspiracy to seize the Suez Canal by force.

    A week after the ceasefire, the Anglo-French invading forces dispatched to seize the canal remain on Egyptian soil, disregarding the United Nations resolution calling for their immediate withdrawal.

    British Prime Minister Eden, in answering questions in the House of Commons on November 13, flatly refused to guarantee the withdrawal of British and French troops before negotiations with Egypt on the Suez dispute. Eden previously repeatedly stated that British troops would only withdraw when the United Nations forces could assume the "responsibility" that the British and French troops had taken upon themselves without authorization.

    French Foreign Minister Pineau in Paris also said that it would be appropriate for the United Nations police force to occupy the entire canal zone from Ismailia to Suez. These remarks exposed the Anglo-French conspiracy to turn the United Nations forces into a weapon to seize the canal.

    In fact, Britain and France have always intended to use force to compel others to accept "international control" of the canal. When Menzies' delegation went to force Egypt to accept the eighteen-nation proposal, British and French troops had already surrounded Egypt, so the British and French troops launched an attack on Egypt as soon as they had the opportunity. Public pressure has stopped the war, but it has not stopped the Anglo-French conspiracy.

    This armed aggression has added an extra burden of 50 million pounds to British taxpayers. The announcement of the death list of invading soldiers has brought grief to their families and friends.

    All of this has increased the people's anger at the government for all the wrongdoings it has done in invading Egypt.

    On November 12, more than two thousand women crowded into the Central Lobby of the House of Commons to demand that parliamentarians restore peace in Egypt and immediately withdraw British troops.

    Dr. Edith Summerskill, in addressing them, said, "There is not a single housewife here - with common sense, love of peace and a sense of right and wrong like you - who would do such a terrible thing as this Conservative Prime Minister has done."

    Labor and Women's Co-operative Guild MP, Mrs. Jois Butler, said, "Withdraw our troops from Egypt, compensate Egypt for the damage we have caused, drive the current government out of office, and seek peaceful solutions to international problems." Her words were met with enthusiastic applause.

### 反对英法用武力夺取苏伊士运河的阴谋  英国人民要求立即撤回侵埃部队

    反对英法用武力夺取苏伊士运河的阴谋
    英国人民要求立即撤回侵埃部队
    据新华社伦敦14日电　本社记者彭迪、钱行报道：英法两国政府无意放弃它们要用武力夺取苏伊士运河的阴谋。
    在停火一周之后，奉调前去夺取运河的英法侵略军仍然留在埃及国土上，而不顾联合国关于让他们立即撤退的决议。
    英国首相艾登11月13日在下议院答复质询的时候干脆就拒绝保证在同埃及就苏伊士争端进行谈判以前先撤退英法军队。艾登以前一再说，只有在联合国部队能够负起英法军队擅自承担的这项“责任”的时候，英国军队才会撤退。
    法国外长比诺在巴黎也说，由联合国警察部队占领从伊士美利亚到苏伊士之间的这整个运河区将是适宜的。他这番话使得英法要把联合国军队变成夺取运河的武器的阴谋暴露无遗了。
    实际上，英法一向打算用武力强迫别人接受对运河的“国际管制”。在孟席斯的代表团前去强使埃及接受十八国建议的时候，英法军队已经包围了埃及，因此后来英法军队一有机会马上对埃及发动了进攻。舆论的压力已经制止了战争，但是并没有制止英法的阴谋。
    这种武装侵略给英国纳税人增加了五千万英镑的额外负担。侵略军队的死亡名单的宣布给他们的家庭和亲友带来了悲痛。
    所有这一切增加了人民对于政府在侵犯埃及方面所做的一切错事的愤怒情绪。
    11月12日，有两千多个妇女挤进下院中央大厅向议员们要求在埃及重建和平和立即撤回英国军队。
    伊迪斯·萨末斯基尔博士在向她们发表谈话时说，“在这里没有一个家庭妇女——像你们这样有常识，热爱和平和有是非感——会干出像这位保守党首相干出的这样糟糕的事体。”
    工党和妇女合作公会议员朱伊斯·巴特勒夫人说，“把我们的军队从埃及撤出来，赔偿我们给埃及造成的损失，把现届政府赶下台去，寻求和平解决国际问题的办法。”她的话受到热烈的喝采。
