Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, November 24th: Staff members of a certain warehouse of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Guangzhou saved materials worth over 7,360 yuan for the country in nine months this year.

This warehouse achieved remarkable results last year in safely storing materials and saving national wealth, earning the title of Second-Class Model Warehouse of the Guangzhou Garrison. This year, in addition to continuing and promoting the methods they created last year, such as using broken bag paper instead of new wrapping paper and reed mats instead of burlap sacks, they have also developed many new ways to save. For example, Second-Class Work Model, Lieutenant Xu Shaode, came up with the idea of using old cloth strips instead of bag-sewing thread and changing the three double ropes for tying burlap sacks to three single ropes. After repeated tests, it was proven that this could ensure the burlap sacks were sewn and tied to specifications and would not affect transit. By adopting Xu Shaode's method, over 4,300 yuan was saved in nine months.

The warehouse also improved stacking methods, paying attention to adjusting air and temperature, and reducing unnecessary "re-stacking" work. For example, reducing one re-stack and cleaning in a certain warehouse saved more than 3,200 yuan.

The warehouse's guards also voluntarily participated in unpaid labor to build the warehouse in their spare time. They worked with the workers to load and unload, and move materials, and swept the warehouse, saving the country 780 yuan in expenses over nine months.

    驻广州部队某仓库的工作人员
    九个月节约物资七千多元
    据新华社广州24日电　中国人民解放军驻广州部队某仓库的工作人员在今年九个月内，为国家节约了总值七千三百六十余元的物资。
    该仓库于去年曾因安全保管物资，节约国家财富取得显著成绩，获得广州驻军二级模范仓库称号。今年他们除继续沿用和推广他们去年创造的利用破包纸代替新包纸，苇席代替麻包等方法以外，又创造许多节约的办法。如二级工作模范徐绍德中尉，想出用旧布条代替缝包线，把捆扎麻包的三道双绳改为三道单绳的办法，经过多次试验，证明能够保证麻包缝合、捆扎合乎规格，不影响途中运转。采用徐绍德的办法，九个月内节约了四千三百多元。
    仓库还改进了堆积方法，注意调整空气、温度，减少了不必要的“倒堆”工作。如某号库内保管的物资减少了一次倒堆与揸拭，就节约三千二百余元。
    仓库的警卫人员也利用业余时间自动参加建设仓库的义务劳动，他们和工人一起装卸、搬运物资，洗扫仓库，九个月来为国家节约开支七百八十元。
