Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, October 31st. The enlarged meeting of the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China concluded on the 30th. The central content of this meeting was to examine the current rural and urban work based on the spirit of the Party's Eighth National Congress, and to arrange the tasks for the winter.

The meeting changed the previous practice of having the leadership make a complete speech first. As early as ten days ago, the Provincial Party Committee issued heuristic outlines to the municipal and district Party committees. During the four-and-a-half-day meeting, the heads of the municipal and district Party committees, as well as the heads of various departments and committees, made analytical and critical speeches in conjunction with examining their own work and arranging the work for the winter; in particular, they engaged in heated discussions on the arrangement of the central work for this winter.

The meeting first held that implementing the resolutions and spirit of the "Eighth National Congress" is the ideological foundation and driving force for ensuring the completion of various tasks and doing a good job in all winter work. Therefore, the meeting called on the entire party in Shandong Province, especially cadres above the county level, to conscientiously study the documents of the "Eighth National Congress" and grasp the spirit and essence of the documents.

The meeting affirmed the significant achievements in agricultural production over the past year. The target set by the Provincial Party Committee to strive to over fulfill the five-year agricultural production increase plan in four years has been successfully completed; more than 80% of the agricultural production cooperatives have achieved increased production, and about 80% of the members have increased their income. This is not only because of favorable weather conditions, but more importantly, the superiority of agricultural cooperativization and the results of the vigorous production campaign launched by the vast number of cadres and the masses after cooperativization last winter and this spring, and the construction of basic farmland. The meeting believed that although there were many deviations and shortcomings in the production measures taken last winter and this spring, the mainstream was correct. The current doubts among some cadres and the masses about the superiority of agricultural cooperativization and production measures, and the lack of enthusiasm for agricultural production this winter (especially basic farmland construction), should fully arouse the attention of leaders at all levels.

In terms of rural work, this winter (from now until the Spring Festival) will focus on production and rectification of cooperatives, and through production and rectification, conscientiously do a good job in township elections and other tasks. The meeting believed that due to the changes in the entire rural production relations, the importance of winter production is even greater than before cooperativization. The development of winter production campaigns (including sideline production) can not only make full and necessary preparations for next year's bumper harvest, but also increase the income of about 20% of the cooperatives and members with average or reduced production this year, which is conducive to the consolidation of agricultural cooperatives. The work of rectifying cooperatives should first focus on doing a good job in production. In addition to improving business management and revising labor quota systems, the important thing is to promote democracy within the cooperatives and further consolidate and promote the socialist enthusiasm and production enthusiasm of the members. The meeting believed that only by conscientiously implementing the policy of running cooperatives democratically can we conscientiously implement the policy of running cooperatives diligently and thriftily. After cooperativization, the reliance of members on the cooperatives is very close. The quality of the cooperatives is related to the lives and future of each member, and they must have a strong demand for running the cooperatives democratically. Many speeches at the meeting cited examples to illustrate that cadres who have a democratic style, are fair in their work, and can learn with an open mind, will definitely be able to run the cooperatives well and win the support of the members; otherwise, they will definitely be opposed by the members.

The meeting believed that conscientiously studying the documents of the "Eighth National Congress" and laying the ideological foundation for implementing the resolutions of the "Eighth National Congress" is not only an important task for cadres in the province this winter, but also an important task for the construction of the Party in Shandong. All cadres must study the documents in depth with the spirit of rectification, examine the subjectivism, bureaucracy, and sectarianism in their work, and effectively change their leadership style. In order to strengthen the leadership of the study, the Provincial Party Committee will establish a unified study leadership organization, and require all departments directly under the province to send some cadres to the countryside, factories, and schools on the basis of studying the documents of the "Eighth National Congress," combined with their own work, to conduct in-depth investigations and research, and summarize typical experiences, in order to achieve the goal of combining theory with practice.

The meeting also made arrangements for other tasks. In terms of urban work, in addition to striving to complete the national plan, the meeting particularly reminded local Party committees to pay attention to safe production, and examine the adverse effects of the "one-chief system" in Shandong's factories and mines, and regard the establishment of a leadership system that combines collective leadership with the Party committee as the core and division of labor and responsibility as an important part of implementing the spirit of the "Eighth National Congress".

### 中共山东省委召开扩大会议  根据“八大”精神检查农村和城市工作

    中共山东省委召开扩大会议
    根据“八大”精神检查农村和城市工作
    新华社济南31日电　中共山东省委员会扩大会议已经在30日闭幕。这次会议的中心内容是根据党的第八次全国代表大会的精神，检查当前的农村和城市工作，并且布置冬季的工作任务。
    会议改变了以往先由领导上作成套发言的做法。早在十天以前，省委就向各市委、地委发出了启发式的提纲。在历时四天半的会议上，各市委、地委和部委负责人，结合检查本身工作并就冬季的工作安排作了有分析有批判的发言；特别是对今冬中心工作的安排，展开了热烈的讨论。
    会议首先认为，贯彻执行“八大”决议和精神，是保证完成各项任务、做好冬季一切工作的思想基础和动力。因此，会议号召山东省全党尤其是县以上干部认真学习“八大”文件，领会文件的精神和实质。
    会议肯定了一年来农业生产的重大成就，省委提出的争取四年超额完成五年农业增产计划的指标已经胜利完成；80％以上的农业生产合作社获得了增产，80％左右的社员增加了收入。这不仅因为天时有利，更重要的还是农业合作化的优越性，广大干部和群众勤勤恳恳执行党的方针政策，去冬今春在合作化后轰轰烈烈开展的生产运动和进行农田基本建设的结果。会议认为，尽管去冬今春生产措施上有过许多偏差和缺点，但主流是正确的。目前某些干部和群众怀疑农业合作化的优越性和生产措施，对今冬农业生产（特别是农田基本建设）的劲头不大，这种情绪应该充分引起各级领导的注意。
    在农村工作方面，今冬（目前到春节）将以生产和整社工作为中心，并通过生产和整社工作认真做好乡选及其他各项工作。会议认为，由于整个农村生产关系的改变，冬季生产的重要性比合作化以前更为重要。今冬生产运动（包括副业生产）的开展，不仅可以为明年的丰收作充分的必要的准备，也可以使今年约20％的平产和减产社和社员增加收入，有利于农业社的巩固。整社工作要首先抓住搞好生产来进行，除改善经营管理、修正劳动定额等制度外，重要的在于发扬社内民主，进一步巩固和发扬社员的社会主义积极性和生产积极性。会议认为，只有认真贯彻民主办社的方针，才能认真贯彻勤俭办社的方针。合作化以后，社员对社的依托是非常紧密的，社办得好坏，关系着每个社员的生活和前途，他们必然都有强烈的民主办社的要求。会上的许多发言都引用实例说明：凡是作风民主，办事公道，又能虚心学习的干部，一定能把社办好，并取得社员拥护；反之就必定遭到社员反对。
    会议认为，认真学习“八大”文件，为贯彻执行“八大”决议打下思想基础，不只是全省干部今冬的一项重要任务，也是山东党的建设的一项重要任务。全体干部必须以整风的精神，深刻钻研文件，检查工作中的主观主义、官僚主义和宗派主义，切实改变领导作风。为了加强对学习的领导，由省委成立一个统一的学习领导组织，并要求省直属各部门，在学习“八大”文件的基础上，结合本身工作，把一部分干部派到农村、工厂、学校去，深入地进行调查研究，总结典型经验，以达到理论和实际相结合的目的。
    会议对于其他各项工作也作了安排。在城市工作方面，除努力完成国家计划外，会议特别提醒各地党委重视安全生产，并就一长制在山东厂矿企业中的不良影响进行检查，把建立以党委为核心的集体领导和分工负责相结合的领导制度，当作贯彻“八大”精神的重要内容。
