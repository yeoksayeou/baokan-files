    Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 15th. The Hunan Provincial Company of the China National Pharmaceutical Corporation is helping agricultural cooperatives in various regions to expand the planting area of major medicinal materials such as papaya, Atractylodes macrocephala, and white peony. This year, it is planned to plant more than 13,000 mu of these medicinal materials. It is estimated that more than 2,400 dan (traditional Chinese unit of weight) of medicinal materials can be produced by next year. At present, seeds are being collected and seedlings are being cultivated in various places.
    In the past, most of the traditional Chinese medicine in Hunan was purchased from other places. In recent years, through vigorous cultivation within the province, and the discovery of many new varieties, the number of medicinal materials purchased from within the province has increased from 126 to more than 250, of which more than 90 can be supplied in large quantities to other places.
    Hunan Province is rich in traditional Chinese medicine, with about 400 species, of which more than 250 species are produced in large quantities and are relatively valuable.

    湖南省扩大药材种植面积
    新华社长沙15日电　中国药材公司湖南省公司帮助各地农业社扩大木瓜、白术、白芍等主要药材的种植面积，今年这些药材计划要种植一万三千多亩。估计到明年能产药材二千四百多市担。现在，各地正在采种育苗。
    湖南的中药过去绝大部分是从外地购进的。近年来省内经过大力培植，又调查发现了许多新品种，现在从省内收购的药材已经由一百二十六种增加到二百五十多种，其中有九十多种还可以大量供应外地。
    湖南省中药产量丰富，约有四百多种，其中产量多而且比较贵重的药材就有二百五十多种。
