The People's Liberation Army Xinjiang Military Region troops have achieved great results this year in increasing production and practicing economy, and opposing waste. The officers and soldiers of a certain unit stationed in southern Xinjiang used various old wood and old equipment to manufacture 55 kinds of military training equipment, totaling more than 10,000 pieces, saving the country more than 5,900 yuan. The officers and soldiers of a certain supply station, in order to reduce transportation costs, launched a red flag competition. The officers and soldiers of the station created a wooden hay baler, which reduced the cost of forage transportation and increased the amount of hay transported by trucks. This item alone saved 200,500 yuan. According to incomplete statistics, from the first quarter to the third quarter of this year, the troops of the entire military region have saved more than 2.6 million yuan for the country.

Many troops have implemented the principles of "good, economical and safe" in the construction of barracks, saving the country a lot of wealth. For example, the officers and soldiers of a certain cavalry unit burned lime and made adobe bricks themselves, reducing the cost per square meter by more than 14 yuan. The Altay Military Sub-district built border guard barracks, saving 69 yuan per square meter while ensuring quality. In the third quarter of this year, a certain automobile unit of the military region saved 123 tons of fuel, which is close to the total amount saved in the whole year last year. At the same time, it saved more than 9,600 yuan in minor repair and maintenance costs, and each set of tires traveled more than 4,900 kilometers more than in the first half of the year.

    解放军驻新疆军区部队从各方面为国家节约财富
    本报讯　中国人民解放军新疆军区部队，今年在增产节约、反对浪费方面获得了很大的成绩。驻南疆某部的官兵，利用各种旧木料和旧器材，自己动手制造了各种军训器材五十五种，计一万多件，为国家节约了五千九百多元。某兵站的官兵，为了减低运输成本，开展了红旗竞赛运动，该站官兵创造了木制捆草机，降低了畜草运输成本，提高了汽车运输载草量，仅这一项就节约了二十万零五百元。据不完全的统计，全军区部队从今年第一季度到第三季度，已为国家节约了经费二百六十多万元。
    许多部队在修建营房中，贯彻了“好、省和安全”的原则，为国家节约了很多财富。如某骑兵部队的官兵，自己烧石灰、打土坯，每一平方公尺造价降低了十四元多。阿勒泰军分区修建边卡营房，在保证质量的前提下，每一平方公尺造价节省了六十九元。军区某汽车部队今年第三季度，节约了油料一百二十三吨，接近了去年全年节约的总数。同时节省了小修保养费九千六百多元，每套轮胎比上半年多行驶四千九百多公里。　（丁学恒）
