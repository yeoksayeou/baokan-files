    Overcoming Difficulties, Gradually Improving Teaching and Living Conditions
    Commentator of this newspaper
    This summer, national institutions of higher learning enrolled a large number of new students. Since the start of the semester, many institutions of higher learning have experienced shortages of school buildings, teachers, and equipment to varying degrees, which has brought many difficulties to teaching work. At present, these problems have attracted the attention and concern of relevant parties, and active research is being conducted to find solutions. The administrative leaders of many institutions of higher learning have also taken active measures to ensure the completion of teaching tasks.
    In recent years, with the care of the Party and the government, a large number of school buildings have been built in institutions of higher learning in our country, many teachers have been trained and supplemented, and teaching experiments and scientific research equipment have also been greatly increased. The teaching conditions of the schools and the teaching and living environment of teachers and students have been greatly improved. However, on the one hand, the task of cultivating talents in institutions of higher learning has been increasing day by day, and manpower, materials, financial resources, and related organizational work have not been able to keep up accordingly; on the other hand, the planning for training cadres has not been placed on a reliable basis, so that school buildings, teachers, equipment, etc. cannot keep up with the needs of school development. For example, in terms of capital construction of institutions of higher learning, the construction area of school buildings from the founding of the country to June of this year has increased by 79% compared with before liberation. Although this number is very large, it is still far from the increase in students. Therefore, these difficulties are difficulties in development and difficulties in progress.
    This year, the enrollment figures for institutions of higher learning are too large. The capital construction plan was issued too late and did not catch up in time. In individual schools, the allocation of teaching rooms and living rooms is also somewhat unreasonable, so there is a phenomenon that school rooms are relatively tight. Due to the rapid development of higher education, teachers have also become a difficulty. Most teachers are new teachers who have only undergone short-term training, and lecturers and teaching assistants who open courses account for almost more than 50% in many schools. Some young teachers are preparing for the exam because they have applied for associate doctorate students, which cannot but affect the current teaching work. Some of the graduates who were assigned to institutions of higher learning as teaching assistants this year have not yet reported to the school. As a result, teachers in institutions of higher learning appear to be even more lacking. The work of teaching instruments and equipment and library materials also lags behind the development of higher education. At present, some of the teaching instruments and equipment in our country are manufactured by instrument factories in industrial departments and factories in scientific research institutions; some are purchased from abroad. Due to limitations in technical level and talent conditions, it is difficult for some schools to buy teaching instruments domestically for a while. Purchasing teaching instruments from abroad is complicated and cannot fully meet the needs for a while. In addition, the relevant parties' lack of support for instruments and equipment used in scientific research and teaching due to system restrictions is also a reason for creating difficulties in scientific research and teaching work.
    The reasons for the above problems are multifaceted. Relevant departments should conduct research, and effective measures should be taken for problems that must be solved at present and can be solved.
      What needs to be urgently resolved at present is the problem of insufficient housing in institutions of higher learning. Where conditions permit, efforts can be made to start construction this winter. At the same time, according to the urgent need for school buildings in some institutions of higher learning, efforts can be made to start building some relatively simple bungalows earlier to overcome the current crowded situation of student dormitories and classrooms. The houses currently under construction should also strive to accelerate the progress of the project. The relevant parties can make reasonable arrangements for materials and construction forces, and consider giving priority to ensuring the current urgent needs of capital construction in institutions of higher learning. The administrative leaders of various institutions of higher learning can also make some reasonable adjustments according to the teaching and living housing situation of the school, and improve the utilization rate of existing school buildings as much as possible. Currently, some schools have already done so. This method is worth advocating.
    All institutions of higher learning should give full play to the potential of existing teachers. In the case of many students and few teachers, schools with conditions can consider adopting the method of holding large classes, inviting experienced and highly qualified teachers to teach. This can solve the difficulty of insufficient teachers and improve the quality of teaching. If the teaching and research section of some schools cannot open courses due to lack of teachers, the relevant parties should immediately find ways to allocate teachers. In addition, some schools have not yet arrived at the school, and some teachers are affecting teaching because they are preparing to apply for associate doctorate students. The Higher Education Department should also assist various schools to solve this problem.
    In terms of teaching equipment, the Higher Education Department and relevant departments should immediately conduct research and propose methods to gradually solve the problems of how the business department allocates some equipment to institutions of higher learning and how to facilitate the purchase of equipment from abroad. For teaching equipment ordered domestically, factories must guarantee to accept orders and deliver goods in a timely manner. Various institutions of higher learning should also pay attention to making full use of existing teaching equipment.
    The difficulties of school buildings, teachers, and equipment faced by higher education in its development cannot be overcome in a short period of time. As everyone knows, capital construction takes a certain amount of time to complete, and training and improving teachers is not a short-term matter, and equipment problems also need to be solved gradually. We should be realistic and not demand too much or be too hasty, wanting to solve many problems all at once, which is not realistic. However, the education department and school leaders should also actively offer ideas and find ways to overcome difficulties and improve the current teaching and living conditions. What must be resolved at present and can be resolved should be resolved in a timely manner; what must be resolved at present but cannot be resolved well should also be made clear to everyone. We believe that the teachers and students of all institutions of higher learning across the country will certainly be able to understand the difficulties in the development of the country's construction cause at present, and strive to overcome these difficulties, carry forward the hard-working and simple style, and conduct teaching and learning happily. With the care and active efforts of all parties, the current teaching and living conditions of institutions of higher learning will definitely gradually improve.

    克服困难，逐步改善教学和生活条件
    本报评论员
    今年暑期，全国高等学校招收了大量新生。开学以来，许多高等学校在不同程度上发生了校舍、师资和设备等不足的现象，给教学工作带来了不少困难。目前，这些问题已引起有关方面的注意和关怀，正在积极研究设法解决。许多高等学校的行政领导上，也都采取了积极的措施，来保证教学任务的完成。
    几年来，在党和政府的关怀下，我国高等学校兴建了大量的校舍，培养和补充了许多师资，在教学实验和科学研究的设备方面，也都有了大量的增添。学校的教学条件，教师学生的教学和生活环境，都有了不少的改善。但是，一方面由于高等学校培养人材的任务日益加大，在人力、物力、财力和有关组织工作方面，都没有能相应地跟上去；另一方面由于培养干部的规划没有放在可靠的基础上，以致校舍、师资、设备等等都赶不上学校发展的需要。例如高等学校基本建设方面，自建国以来到今年6月，校舍的建筑面积比解放前增加了79％，虽然这个数字很大，但是同学生增加的情况还有很大的距离。因此，这些困难是发展中的困难，前进中的困难。
    今年高等学校招生数字过大。基本建设计划下达过迟，没有及时赶上去。个别学校，在调配教学用房和生活用房方面，也有不太合理的地方，所以就发生了学校用房比较紧张的现象。由于高等教育事业的迅速发展，师资也发生了困难。大多数教师是只经过短期培养的新教师，讲师、助教开课的在不少学校中几乎占50％以上。有些青年教师因为报考了副博士研究生，一心准备考试，这也不能不影响了目前的教学工作。今年分配到高等学校做助教的毕业生，到现在有的还没有报到。这样一来，高等学校教师就更显得缺乏了。教学的仪器设备和图书资料工作，在高等教育发展的形势下面，也显得赶不上去。目前，我国教学的仪器设备，一部分是由工业部门的仪器工厂和科学研究机关的工厂制造；一部分是向国外购买的。由于技术水平和人才等等条件的限制，有些学校的教学仪器，在国内一时是很难买到的。向国外购买教学仪器，往返周折，一时也不能完全满足需要。另外，有关方面由于制度的限制，对科学研究和教学所用的仪器设备的支持还不够，也是给科学研究和教学工作上造成了困难的一个原因。
    产生以上问题的原因是多方面的。有关部门应该进行研究，对于目前必须解决而又可能解决的问题，应该采取有效措施。
      目前需要迫切解决的，是高等学校房屋不够的问题。在有条件的地方，可争取今年冬季施工。同时，根据某些高等学校急需校舍的情况，可以争取先提早动工盖些比较简单的平房，以克服目前学生宿舍、教室拥挤情形。现在正在施工建造的房屋，也应该争取加速工程进度。对于材料和施工力量，有关方面可以合理安排，考虑首先保证高等学校目前基本建设方面的急需。各高等学校的行政领导方面，也可根据学校教学和生活住房的情况，合理地进行一些调整，尽可能地提高现有校舍的利用率。目前，有些学校已经这样做了。这个办法是值得提倡的。
    各高等学校要充分发挥现有师资的潜在力量。在学生多、教师少的情况下，有条件的学校可以考虑采用上大班课的办法，请有经验而水平较高的教师讲课。这样做，可以解决教师不足的困难，也可以提高讲授质量。有些学校的教研组因教师缺乏不能开课，有关方面要立即设法调配教师。另外，有些学校的教师至今尚未到校，有的教师因准备报考副博士研究生影响教学，对于这个问题，高等教育部也要协助各校加以解决。
    在教学设备方面，关于业务部门调拨一些设备给高等学校以及如何便利向国外购买设备等项问题，高等教育部和有关部门要立即进行研究，提出办法，逐步予以解决。在国内订购的教学设备，工厂要做到保证接受订货，及时交货。各高等学校也应当注意把已有教学设备充分利用起来。
    高等教育事业在发展中所面临的校舍、师资和设备的困难，不是一时所能克服的。大家知道，基本建设需要一定时间才能兴建完工，培养和提高师资也不是短时期的事情，而设备问题也需要逐步解决。我们应该实事求是，不能要求过高过急，想把许多问题一下子解决，这是不切合实际的。但是，教育部门和学校领导方面，也应该积极出主意，想办法，克服困难，改善目前的教学和生活条件。目前必须解决而又有可能解决的，就应该及时解决；目前必须解决但是不可能很好解决的，也应当向大家说清楚。我们相信，全国各个高等学校的师生们，一定能够体谅目前国家建设事业发展中的困难，并且努力克服这些困难，发扬艰苦朴素的作风，愉快地进行教学和学习。在各方面的关怀和积极努力下，高等学校目前的教学和生活条件，一定会逐步改善。
