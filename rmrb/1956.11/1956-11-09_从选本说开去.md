Title: Starting from Anthologies

    Not long ago, I wrote a short article for the Shanghai "Liberation Daily" entitled "Anthologies." Later, I read two articles on the same topic in this publication. In terms of specific arguments, there didn't seem to be much discrepancy. For example, everyone unanimously called for good anthologies. However, in terms of the overall spirit, they were quite different. Comrade Qi Shi favored complete works over anthologies, while Comrade Da Jie's opinion was closer to mine. We both believe that this work is worth doing, and even if "we have now reached an age of anthologies again," it is not a bad phenomenon. Anthologies and complete works are not inherently opposed.
    But I would like to further elaborate on my views.
    If we can calmly consider the matter, we will find a fact: since the mid-Qing Dynasty, the reason why most people know Tang poetry and can recite some of it is not because they have read the sixty-six volumes of the "Collected Works of Du Gongbu" or the seventy-five volumes of Bai's "Changqing Collection," but rather because they were influenced by the "Three Hundred Tang Poems," which has always been disdained by the literati. Similarly, the reason why most people know of the "Eight Great Prose Masters of the Tang and Song Dynasties" and understand the writings of Han and Su is not because they have read the forty volumes of "Han Changli's Collection" or the one hundred and fifteen volumes of "Dongpo's Complete Works," but because they learned it from a "Guwen Guanzhi" that makes scholars shake their heads. Of course, they are shallow and inevitably ridiculed by "experts," but ridicule alone cannot solve the existing problem. This fact inspires us not to ignore the role of anthologies, let alone simply abolish them, but to do a good job in compiling anthologies.
    Mr. Lu Xun said, "What anthologies display is often not the characteristics of the author, but the vision of the compiler." He was dissatisfied with those "small-minded" "compilers," believing that what they selected was not enough for experts to "apply" when "studying literature or a certain writer," which is correct. The so-called "vision" encompasses the great knowledge of "knowing people and discussing the world." Using this to demand from past compilers inevitably leads to shortcomings. If today's literary researchers and literary historians do not go beyond anthologies to further pursue the "whole person" of the research object, it will be difficult to obtain scientific conclusions. But this does not mean that anthologies should not be compiled in the future. Today's compilers have more possibilities to grasp the historical materialist viewpoint, and they can give us some good things. Mr. Lu Xun's argument was based on the specific circumstances at the time, not a general opposition to compilers. He would not be unaware that, in a sense, literary researchers and literary historians themselves are also compilers. Can they necessarily give readers the concept of the "whole person"?
    Starting from this point, it is not difficult to understand the true meaning of Mr. Lu Xun's article.
    But our demand to do a good job in compiling anthologies does not mean that it can be used for "studying literature or a certain writer." A specialized research project needs to break through secondary materials, needs to eliminate existing influences, and put forward its own views. Therefore, the materials it needs must be as rich as possible and as comprehensive as possible. But even so, it cannot be considered that anthologies have no role for experts. In my opinion, it is always the precursor to experts.
    We cherish experts and all specialized works, but high mountains cannot rise from flat ground. It also needs hills and ridges. The purpose of anthologies is, of course, to provide general readers with a taste. Its widespread appearance reflects the social atmosphere of valuing scholarship, and it begins to jump out of the circle of "copying and repeating what others say," requiring a little contact with the original works. Therefore, it is precisely the bridge to the complete works. If the average person has not even read a single Tang poem, our Du Fu experts may be happily "entering a no-man's land," but I don't know how he will be able to exert his abilities.
    Someone must diligently cultivate the land of anthologies so that knowledge can green our society and promote experts to never wither—of course, this cannot be expected from Master Ma in "The Scholars," who only loves to drink "chupian." Therefore, I hope to have good anthologies and compilers who can truly get rid of prejudice.

### 从选本说开去

    从选本说开去
    唐弢
    不久以前，我替上海“解放日报”写过一篇题为“选本”的短文，后来又在本版上读到两篇讨论同一问题的文章，在具体的论点上，似乎没有什么大出入，譬如大家一致要求有好的选本；但从总的精神看起来，却是颇为不同的：齐士同志是薄选本而崇全集，大杰同志的意见和我的比较相接近，我们都认为这个工作值得做，即使“现在又到了一个选本的时代”，也不是什么坏现象，选本和全集首先就不是对立的东西。
    但我还想申说一下自己的意见。
    如果我们能够平心静气地想一想，就会发现一个这样的事实：从清朝中叶以来，一般人之所以知道唐诗，并且能够背诵其中的几首，并不是读过六十六卷的“杜工部集”或者七十五卷的白氏“长庆集”，倒是受了一向为士林所不齿的“唐诗三百首”的影响；一般人之知道有所谓“唐宋八大家”，懂得韩苏文章，也并非读过四十卷的“韩昌黎集”或者一百十五卷的“东坡全集”，倒是从一部使通人摇头的“古文观止”里得来的。自然，他们很浅薄，不免为“方家”所讪笑，然而光是讪笑却无法解决实际存在的问题。这个事实启示我们不应该忽视选本的作用，更不能干脆取消选本，而是必须做好选本的工作。
    鲁迅先生说：“选本所显示的，往往并非作者的特色，倒是选者的眼光。”他不满于那些“眼光如豆”的“选家”，认为所选的不足以供专家在“研究文学或某一作家”时的“应用”，这是对的。所谓
  “眼光”包含着“知人论世”的大学问，以此要求过去的选家，就不免常有缺点，今天的文学研究者和文学史家如果不跨过选本，进一步去追求研究对象的“全人”，那就很难得到科学的论断。但这并不等于说以后就不要选本，今天的选家已经有更多可能掌握历史唯物主义的观点，他们能够给我们一些好东西。鲁迅先生是针对当时具体情况立论的，不是一般地在反对选家，他不会不知道，在某种意义上说，文学研究者和文学史家本身也是一个选家，难道他们倒一定能够给读者以“全人”的观念吗？
    从这点出发来读鲁迅先生的文章，它的真正的含义是不难理解的。
    但我们之要求把选本工作做好，却也并不认为这就可以供“研究文学或某一作家”时的“应用”，一件专门研究工作有必要突破第二手材料，有必要摒除现成的影响，提出自己的主见，因此它所需要的材料一定是越丰富越好，越全面越好。但即使这样，也不能认为选本对于专家就没有作用，在我看来，它永远是专家的先导。
    我们珍爱专家，珍爱一切专门的著作，然而平地是起不了高山的，它还需要有岗峦。选本的目的固然在供一般人涉猎，它的大量出现却反映了社会重视学术的风气，开始从“抄来抄去，人云亦云”的圈子里跳出来，要求多少接触一点原著，因此它正是通向全集的桥梁。如果一般人连一首唐诗都没有读过，我们的杜甫专家也许会痛快得“如入无人之境”吧，然而我不知道他将怎样发挥自己的本领。
    必须有人在选本这块土地上辛勤地耕耘，这才能够使知识绿化我们的社会，并且推动专家使其永不枯萎——自然，这不能期待于“儒林外史”里只爱喝“处片”的马二先生，因此我希望有好的选本，有真正能够摆脱偏见的选家。
