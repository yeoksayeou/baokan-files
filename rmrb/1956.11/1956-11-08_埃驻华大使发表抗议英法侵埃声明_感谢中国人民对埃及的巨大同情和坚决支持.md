Xinhua News Agency, 7th. Egyptian Ambassador to China, Ragheb, held a press conference in Beijing this morning. At the conference, Ambassador Ragheb read out his statement protesting Anglo-French aggression against Egypt to Chinese and foreign journalists.

The full text of Ambassador Ragheb's statement is as follows:

Egypt, in exercising its sovereignty, has nationalized the Suez Canal. When the imperialists discovered that the Egyptian people refused to relinquish their freedom and independence, they launched a war.

The British and French governments instigated Israel to attack Egypt, and then used this attack as a pretext for launching their own armed aggression against Egypt.

British and French air forces bombed Egyptian cities, towns, and villages, massacring innocent women and children; at the same time, they destroyed factories, monasteries, churches, and schools. Even hospitals were not spared in this unwarranted attack on Egyptian soil.

This aggression has aroused strong protests from countries all over the world. Even in Britain and France, some people are now protesting.

The Chinese people fully support Egypt's struggle against the imperialists and in defense of its independence and sovereignty.

The mass demonstrations held in China against Anglo-French aggression against Egypt demonstrate the determination of the 600 million Chinese people to defend world peace and international justice. More than 400,000 people gathered in Tiananmen Square in Beijing, strongly condemning Anglo-French aggression against Egypt and expressing their hope that peace can be realized in every part of this troubled world.

The Egyptian Embassy has received letters in the past few days expressing support and sympathy for Egypt's sacred struggle. In Beijing alone, more than two million people have written letters. The Egyptian Embassy has also received similar letters of support from the people of the Mongolian People's Republic, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and other countries in the Far East.

At the same time, we have received letters from more than 250,000 Chinese workers, women, and students across China, expressing their fervent desire to volunteer to join the Egyptian side to fight against imperialism. This matter has been notified to the Egyptian authorities in Cairo so that they can make use of this friendly assistance offered by our Chinese brothers if they wish to do so.

Many Chinese organizations have expressed their willingness to supply Egyptian relief organizations with food, medical supplies, medicines, and other medical necessities, and this is now being organized, and it will soon be sent from China to Egypt via the fastest route.

By their attack on Egypt, Britain and France are writing their own moral death warrant. Their reputation has been severely damaged not only in Egypt and the Arab world but also throughout the world. But let these warmongers realize this: no matter what loss of life and property they can inflict on the peace-loving Egyptian people with their superior weapons and numbers, they can never suppress the fighting spirit of Egypt, which will ultimately triumph over any benefits they may have gained through massacre.

Whatever material gains Britain and France may obtain in Egypt will never be enough to compensate for the moral loss that these two governments have already inflicted on their reputations in the face of world opinion.

The battle we Egyptians are now fighting is not just about Egypt alone. It concerns all countries suffering under the heavy shackles of imperialism, countries that will be able to break free from these shackles once imperialism is weakened. Such countries must remain vigilant at all times, because imperialism, like all professional criminals, will always want to return to its past crime scenes whenever it deems it appropriate and capable of doing so.

Seeing that it could not deal with Egypt alone, Britain dragged its puppet Israel and France together to re-establish its foothold in Egypt.

The heroic resistance of the Egyptian people proves that no matter how brutal the weapons that the imperialists can invent or how many manpower they can muster, they cannot match a people determined to defend their territory and freedom.

Egypt's example is a lesson that other countries still suffering under imperialist enslavement can learn. Egypt has proven that the deadliest weapons against imperialist aggression are determination, courage, and, most importantly, unity.

In the darkest hour my beloved country is going through, we here in China can see a very bright light that illuminates the hearts of all Egyptians, because we have personally witnessed the great sympathy and firm support of the great Chinese people for our just cause.

I wish to express the gratitude and appreciation of millions of Egyptian friends to the Chinese people.

### 埃驻华大使发表抗议英法侵埃声明  感谢中国人民对埃及的巨大同情和坚决支持

    埃驻华大使发表抗议英法侵埃声明
    感谢中国人民对埃及的巨大同情和坚决支持
    新华社7日讯　埃及驻中国大使拉加布今天上午在北京举行了一个记者招待会。在招待会上，拉加布大使向中外记者宣读了他抗议英法侵略埃及的声明。
    拉加布大使发表的声明全文如下：
    埃及行使它的主权，已经把苏伊士运河收归国有。当帝国主义分子发现埃及人民拒绝放弃他们的自由和独立时，他们发动了战争。
    英国和法国政府唆使以色列进攻埃及，然后把这个进攻当作借口，他们自己向埃及发动了武装进攻。
    英法空军轰炸了埃及的城市、市镇和乡村；屠杀无辜的妇女、儿童；同时，摧毁工厂、寺院、教堂、学校。在对埃及的土地进行的毫无理由的攻击中，连医院也不能幸免。
    这个侵略引起世界各国的强烈抗议。即使在英国和法国，现在也有某些人在提出抗议。
    中国人民全力支持埃及为了反对帝国主义分子、保卫它的独立和主权而进行的斗争。
    在中国所举行的反对英法侵略埃及的群众游行，表示了六亿中国人民保卫世界和平和国际正义的决心。有四十多万人聚集在北京的天安门广场，他们强烈地谴责英法侵略埃及，并且表示希望在这个纷扰不安的世界的每一部分都能实现和平。
    埃及大使馆在过去几天中收到了表示支持和同情埃及的神圣的斗争的信件。仅在北京一地，就有二百多万人写了信。埃及大使馆还收到了蒙古人民共和国、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、越南民主共和国和远东的其它国家的人民同样的表示支持的信件。
    同时，我们接到来自全中国二十五万以上的中国工人、妇女和学生的信件，表示热烈希望志愿参加到埃及方面，对帝国主义进行斗争。这一件事已经通知开罗的埃及当局了，以便如果他们愿意利用我们的中国兄弟所提供的这种友好的帮助就可以加以利用。
    中国的许多团体已经表示愿意供给埃及的救济组织以食物、医药用品、药品和其它医疗必需品，现在正在组织这件事，不久，它将通过最快的途径从中国送到埃及去。
    英国和法国通过它们对埃及的进攻，正在写它们自己的道义上的绝命书。它们的名誉不仅在埃及和阿拉伯世界受到了严重损害，而且在全世界受到了严重损害。但是，让这些战争贩子们了解到这一件事吧：不管它们用它们的占优势的武器和人数能使爱好和平的埃及人民遭受什么样的生命和财产的损失，它们永远不能阻止埃及的战斗精神，这种精神最终将战胜它们通过屠杀可能已经得到的任何利益。
    无论英国和法国可能在埃及得到什么样物质上的利益，但是这些永远不足以补偿这两个政府已经使它们的名誉在世界舆论前面所遭受的道义上的损失。
    我们埃及人现在正在进行的战斗并不仅仅关系到埃及一个国家。它关系到在帝国主义沉重的枷锁下受苦难的所有国家，这些国家一俟帝国主义受到削弱，将能够摆脱这个枷锁。这种国家必须经常保持警惕，因为帝国主义和所有职业罪犯们一样，永远要想回到它的过去的罪恶的场所去，只要它认为适当和有能力这样做的话。
    英国看到它不能单独对付埃及，就把傀儡以色列和法国拉在一起去在埃及重新建立它的立脚点。
    埃及人民的英勇抵抗证明，不管帝国主义者能够发明多么凶残的武器或者能够纠集多么众多的人力，它不能同决心保卫他们的领土和自由的人民相匹敌。
    埃及的榜样是其他仍然在帝国主义的奴役下受苦受难的国家可以学习的教训。埃及已经证明，反对帝国主义侵略的最致命的武器是决心、勇气和最重要的是团结。
    在我所热爱的国家正在度过的最黑暗的时刻里，我们在中国这里能看到一道非常灿烂的光，它照亮了所有埃及人的心，因为我们亲自看到了伟大的中国人民对我们的正义事业的巨大同情和坚决支持。
    我愿向中国人民表达千百万埃及朋友的谢意和感激之情。
