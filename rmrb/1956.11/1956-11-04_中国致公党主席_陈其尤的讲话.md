Comrades and fellow countrymen,

Egypt has been invaded! Peace in Asia, Africa, and the world is under serious threat! We will never allow the barbaric acts of aggression by 19th-century imperialist colonizers to reappear in the 20th century! We will never allow world peace to be damaged in the slightest!

I now represent all members of the China Zhi Gong Party in expressing our utmost anger, and solemnly condemn and protest the gangsterism of the British and French imperialists in launching a war of aggression against Egypt!

Just as the people of the world were earnestly hoping that the Suez Canal issue could be resolved peacefully through negotiations based on the principles of the recent United Nations Security Council resolution, the British and French imperialists dared to defy the world by openly instigating Israel to launch an armed attack on Egypt, and using this artificial situation as a pretext, organized a joint Anglo-French invasion force to brazenly launch a large-scale war of aggression against Egypt. We, the Chinese people, cannot sit idly by and watch the British and French imperialists arbitrarily slaughter the Egyptian people, seize Egyptian land, and destroy world peace. At the same time, we want to solemnly tell the British and French imperialists that the people of Asia and Africa have united today to oppose colonialism, and will no longer be slaughtered like before. You must immediately cease all acts of aggression against Egypt, immediately withdraw your invading troops from Egyptian territory, and cancel all threats, and promptly conduct peaceful consultations on the Suez Canal issue in accordance with the resolutions of the United Nations Security Council in order to seek a reasonable solution. If you disregard the will of the people of the world and insist on going your own way, you will surely face final destruction.

Although Egypt and China are far apart, the people of our two countries are against colonialism. The Chinese people have suffered from imperialist aggression, and we deeply sympathize with the aggression that the Egyptian people are suffering today. We will always firmly stand on the side of the Egyptian people. The Egyptian people will never be isolated in their just struggle to defend their sovereignty and independence. We comrades of the China Zhi Gong Party, no matter where we are, will spare no sacrifice and, together with our compatriots across the country, support the Egyptian people to the end!

We salute the Egyptian people and their leader, President Nasser!

Victory will surely belong to the Egyptian people!

    中国致公党主席
    陈其尤的讲话
    同胞们，同志们：
    埃及人民遭到了侵略！亚非两洲和世界的和平受到了严重的威胁！我们决不容许十九世纪帝国主义殖民者的野蛮侵略行为再在二十世纪的今天出现！我们绝不容许世界和平受到一丝一毫的破坏！
    我现在代表中国致公党全体同志，以无比愤怒的心情对英、法帝国主义者发动侵略埃及战争的强盗行为，表示严正的谴责和抗议！
    正当全世界人民殷切期待苏伊士运河问题能够根据联合国安全理事会最近决定的原则通过和平协商方式求得解决的时候，英、法帝国主义者，竟敢冒天下之大不韪，公开唆使以色列向埃及发动武装进攻，并利用这种人为的局面作为借口，组织英法联合侵略军，悍然发动大规模侵略埃及的战争，我们中国人民决不能坐视英法帝国主义任意屠杀埃及人民、侵占埃及土地、破坏世界的和平。同时我们要正告英法帝国主义者，亚非两洲的人民，今天已经一致起来反对殖民主义，不再像以前那样任人宰割了。你们必须立即停止对埃及的一切侵略行动，立即从埃及领土上撤退侵略军和取消一切威胁，并迅速按照联合国安全理事会的决议，对苏伊士运河问题进行和平协商以求合理解决。如果你们不顾全世界人民的公意，硬要继续一意孤行，那么你们一定要遭到最后的毁灭。
    埃及和中国虽然相隔很远，但是，我们两国人民都是反对殖民主义的。中国人民曾经遭受过帝国主义的侵略，我们对埃及人民今天所遭受的侵略，是深切同情的。我们永远坚决地站在埃及人民这一方面。埃及人民在他们维护自己的主权和独立的正义斗争中将永远不是孤立的。我们中国致公党的同志们无论在什么地方，都将不顾一切牺牲与全国同胞一道，支援埃及人民到底！
    我们向埃及人民及其领袖纳赛尔总统致敬！
    胜利一定属于埃及人民！
