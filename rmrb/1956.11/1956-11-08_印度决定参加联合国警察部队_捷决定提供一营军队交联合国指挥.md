Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, November 7th - According to the Indian Information Bureau, the Indian government has decided to send a limited number of troops to West Asia at the invitation of the UN Secretary-General. These troops will be part of the international police force under the auspices of the United Nations.

However, an official spokesman stated that India could only decide to actually participate in this operation after learning the entire plan, and on the condition that Egypt also agreed to this measure. Furthermore, the establishment of such a force should be linked to the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Egypt. At the same time, India cannot agree if sending such a force implies any recognition of aggression.

It is reported that the Indian Cabinet held an emergency meeting on November 6th. At the meeting, Prime Minister Nehru presented copies of a letter to him from Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Bulganin, and a copy of the Soviet note demanding that the United Kingdom, France, and Israel cease hostilities in the Middle East.

According to the "Times of India," the Indian Ministry of Defence agencies were already in action on the evening of November 6th, drafting preliminary plans for sending a limited number of Indian troops to participate in the proposed UN police force.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, November 7th - Czechoslovakia, in accordance with the United Nations resolution, will participate in the UN action aimed at stopping military operations in Egypt and has decided to place a battalion under the command of the UN forces. This was stated by Czechoslovak Foreign Minister David in a telegram to UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld on the 6th.

    印度决定参加联合国警察部队
    捷决定提供一营军队交联合国指挥
    新华社新德里7日电　据印度新闻局消息，印度政府已经决定应联合国秘书长的邀请派遣有限的部队前往西亚，这些部队将作为联合国主持的国际警察部队的一部分。
    然而，官方发言人声明，只有在获悉整个计划以后，而且必须在埃及也同意这一措施的情况下，印度才能决定实际参加这个行动。此外，建立这种部队应该同一切外国军队撤出埃及联系起来进行。同时如果派遣这种部队包含任何认可侵略的意义，印度都不能同意。
    据悉，印度内阁曾经在11月6日举行紧急会议。尼赫鲁总理在会上提出了苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁给他的信和苏联要求联合王国、法国和以色列在中东停止战争的照会的副本。
    据“印度时报”报道，印度国防部的机构11月6日晚已经行动起来，拟订派遣有限度的印度军队参加拟议中的联合国警察部队的初步计划。
    新华社布拉格7日电　捷克斯洛伐克根据联合国的决议，将参加目的在于制止在埃及的军事行动的联合国行动，决定把一个营交给联合国部队指挥。这是捷克斯洛伐克外交部长戴维6日电告联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德的。
