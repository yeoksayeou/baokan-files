    Ceylonese Prime Minister
    Demands Withdrawal of British and French Troops from Egypt
    Xinhua News Agency, 1st dispatch from Colombo: Ceylonese Prime Minister Bandaranaike said today that "Israel's invasion of Egyptian territory and the subsequent landing of British and French troops on Egyptian territory have created a very serious international situation."
    He said, "In my opinion, neither Israel's invasion of Egypt nor the subsequent actions taken by Britain and France are justified. This also seems to be the general opinion of the world."
    At a press conference, the Ceylonese Prime Minister announced that he was about to send an urgent appeal to the President of the United States, the Prime Minister of Britain, the Prime Minister of France, and to the United Nations, demanding the withdrawal of British and French troops from Egyptian territory.
    When asked if he believed that Israel's actions were instigated by certain other countries, he said that he was not prepared to make any arbitrary guesses. He also said: "The fact that Israel's actions occurred at a time when it enabled Britain and France to do what they had been wanting to do, namely to regain control of the Suez Canal, this coincidence seems very strange."

    锡兰总理
    要英法军队撤出埃及
    据新华社1日讯　科伦坡消息：锡兰总理班达拉奈克今天说，“以色列侵入埃及领土和英法军队接着在埃及领土登陆，已经造成非常严重的国际局势。”
    他说：“在我看来，不论以色列侵入埃及和英法接着采取的行动都是没有适当理由的。这似乎也是全世界普遍的意见。”
    锡兰总理在记者招待会上宣布，他正要向美国总统、英国首相、法国总理以及向联合国发出紧急呼吁，要求英法军队撤出埃及领土。
    在被问到他是否认为以色列的行动受到其他某些国家的唆使的时候，他说，他不准备任意作任何猜测。他又说：“以色列的行动发生在这样一个时候，这使得英法能够做它们一直在想做的事情，也就是夺回对苏伊士运河的控制，这种巧合似乎是很奇怪的。”
