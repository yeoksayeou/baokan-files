Xinhua News Agency, November 23rd: TASS reports: In the Soviet Union, the Lanzhou-Urumqi-Aktogay railway has completed the roadbed for the first twenty kilometers of the main line. Simultaneously, the track equipment at Aktogay station is being expanded. The roadbeds for three branch lines have been completed, and the eleven-kilometer branch line leading to the ballast quarry is currently under construction.

Two mechanized work teams, braving the severe cold, are enthusiastically working on the line, operating numerous excavators, bulldozers, dump trucks, and other machines.

Another group of Soviet construction workers is preparing a large-scale industrial supply base for this construction project. In Almaty, a reinforced concrete structure factory, a carpentry factory, and a repair base are being built. In Aktogay, a rail assembly base has been established to mechanize the track laying work, and construction sites for manufacturing prefabricated reinforced concrete, garages, and carpentry workshops are currently underway.

Housing for the construction personnel is also being built on a large scale. More than twenty residential buildings have already been built in the construction personnel residential area at Aktogay station. Before the end of this year, four more public dormitories will be completed.

    兰州到阿克斗卡铁路线筑好一段路基
    新华社23日讯　据塔斯社报道：兰州—乌鲁木齐—阿克斗卡铁路苏联境内段已经筑成了头二十公里的干线的路基。同时，阿克斗卡车站上的线路设备也正在扩建中。三条支线的路基已经筑好了，通往道碴采石场的十一公里长的支线目前正在建筑中。
    两个机械化工作队不顾严寒的侵袭，操纵着许多挖掘机、推土机、自卸卡车和其他机器，在线路上热情地工作着。
    另一批苏联建筑工人正在为这个建筑工程准备一个规模巨大的工业供应基地。在阿拉木图正在建筑钢筋混凝土结构工厂、木工工厂和修配基地；在阿克斗卡，已经建立了一个使铺轨工作机械化的路轨组装基地，目前正在建筑制造装配式钢筋混凝土的工地、汽车库和木工车间等工程。
    建筑人员的住宅也正在大量兴建中，在阿克斗卡车站的建筑人员居住区已经建筑了二十多幢住宅。今年年底以前，还要造好四幢公共宿舍。
