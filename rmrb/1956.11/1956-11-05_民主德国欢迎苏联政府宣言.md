Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, November 4th (TASS dispatch): The government of the German Democratic Republic issued a statement on the Soviet government's declaration regarding the basis for developing and further strengthening the friendship and cooperation between the Soviet Union and other socialist countries.

    The statement emphasized that in order to guarantee peace and build socialism, socialist countries must maintain strong unity. The Government of the German Democratic Republic believes that countries in the great socialist family can only establish their mutual relations on the principles of complete equality, respect for the inviolability of territory, national independence and sovereignty, and non-interference in internal affairs. Therefore, the Government of the German Democratic Republic welcomes the Soviet declaration, which is fully in line with its views.

    The German Democratic Republic has signed a series of treaties and agreements with the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, guaranteeing regular fraternal cooperation and mutual support in political, economic, and other aspects, thus closely linking it with these countries. This relationship between the German Democratic Republic and other socialist countries, based on equality, greatly promotes the consolidation of the German Democratic Republic.

    Regarding the Soviet armed forces stationed on the territory of the German Democratic Republic to defend peace, the statement said that as long as the four major powers have not concluded an agreement on the withdrawal of all occupation forces, the presence of Soviet troops in the German Democratic Republic remains a necessary measure to ensure the security of the German people and the security of Europe.

    The statement emphasized that the Government of the German Democratic Republic believes that it is still necessary for socialist countries to make joint efforts in the future to defend the peaceful labor of their people.

    民主德国欢迎苏联政府宣言
    新华社4日讯　据塔斯社柏林4日讯：德意志民主共和国政府就苏联政府关于发展和进一步加强苏联同其他社会主义国家的友谊和合作的基础的宣言发表了一次声明。
    声明强调指出，为了保障和平和建成社会主义，社会主义国家必须保持牢固的团结。德意志民主共和国政府认为，社会主义各民族大家庭中的各国只可能本着完全平等、尊重领土的不可侵犯、国家独立和主权以及互不干涉内政这些原则，建立它们的相互关系。因此，德意志民主共和国政府欢迎苏联宣言，这项宣言同它的观点完全一致。
    德意志民主共和国同苏联和其他社会主义国家签订了一系列保证在它们之间进行经常的兄弟合作和在政治、经济和其他方面相互支援的条约和协定，从而同这些国家紧密地联系在一起。德意志民主共和国同其他社会主义国家之间这种建立在平等基础上的关系，在很大程度上促进着德意志民主共和国的巩固。
    这一项声明在谈到驻扎在德意志民主共和国领土上捍卫和平的苏联武装部队的时候说，只要四大国之间还没有缔结关于撤退一切占领军的协定，苏联军队留在德意志民主共和国就仍然是保证德国人民的安全和欧洲安全所必要的措施。
    声明强调指出，德意志民主共和国政府认为，社会主义国家在今后仍然有必要进行共同努力以捍卫它们人民的和平劳动。
