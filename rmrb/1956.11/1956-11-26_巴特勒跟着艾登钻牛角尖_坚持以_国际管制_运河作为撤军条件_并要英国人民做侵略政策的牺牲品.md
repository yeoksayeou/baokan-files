Xinhua News Agency, November 25th, London dispatch: Acting British Prime Minister Butler has reiterated that Britain will only withdraw its troops from Egypt on the condition of "international control" of the Suez Canal and the clearing of the canal.

Butler stated at a Conservative Party meeting held at Cambridge University on November 24th that British troops would withdraw from Port Said when Britain believes that "certain tasks have been completed." He pointed out that these "tasks" are: "We hope to establish an international system for the Suez Canal. We firmly advocate cleaning up the Suez Canal in the United Nations."

Butler's speech is also seen as an effort to seek support at home and abroad. When talking about the troop withdrawal issue, he said: "It is of great importance whether the Western alliance, the United States government, and the Commonwealth will support us." He requested that some countries' governments, including the United States, support Britain's "determination" to achieve the aforementioned "tasks."

Butler had to admit that Britain's aggression against Egypt is deepening the political and economic crisis in Britain. He admitted that most of the British people are criticizing the action of aggression against Egypt. He said: "The degree of division in our country has surprised us somewhat." However, he asked everyone to endure the "sacrifices" brought to people's lives by the government's aggressive behavior.

    巴特勒跟着艾登钻牛角尖
    坚持以“国际管制”运河作为撤军条件
    并要英国人民做侵略政策的牺牲品
    新华社25日讯　伦敦消息：代行英国首相职务的巴特勒重申，英国要以“国际管制”苏伊士运河和清理运河作为英军撤出埃及的条件。
    巴特勒11月24日在剑桥大学举行的保守党员会议上说，当英国认为“在完成了一定的任务的时候”，英国军队将撤离塞得港。他指出这些“任务”是：“我们希望为苏伊士运河建立国际制度。我们在联合国中坚决主张清理苏伊士运河。”
    巴特勒的演讲还被认为是他向国内外寻求支持的一种努力。他在谈到撤兵问题的时候说：“关系重大的是，西方联盟、美国政府和英联邦是否将支持我们”。他要求包括美国在内的一些国家政府能够支持英国实现上述“任务”的“决心”。
    巴特勒不得不承认英国对埃及的侵略行动正在加深英国政治和经济的危机。他承认大部分英国人民在指责侵略埃及的行动。他说：“我们国家的分裂的程度使我们有些吃惊。”不过，他要求大家忍受因为政府的侵略行为给人民生活带来的“牺牲”。
