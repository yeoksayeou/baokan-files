Xinhua News Agency, November 22nd, New York dispatch: Syrian Foreign Minister Salah al-Din Bitar sent a telegram to UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld on the 21st, accusing Israel of colluding with Britain and France to amass troops on the Syrian and Jordanian borders in an attempt to invade.

Bitar's telegram stated: "Despite the ceasefire resolution passed by the UN General Assembly, Israel has been concentrating troops along the Syrian-Israeli border and the Jordanian-Israeli border. French and British troops have joined Israeli troops in these military operations. This joint Franco-British-Israeli action once again threatens peace and security in the Middle East. This demonstrates the aggressive intentions of those countries currently engaged in aggression. I request that you bring these facts to the attention of the Security Council and the UN General Assembly. The Syrian government hopes that the UN General Assembly can immediately review these facts."

Xinhua News Agency, November 22nd, Damascus dispatch from TASS: A Syrian Foreign Ministry spokesperson stated to the press that it has been confirmed that British and French troops actively participated in the Israeli army's campaign in the Sinai Peninsula.

He said that, for example, according to reliable sources, British and French troops were transported to the Israeli port of Haifa as early as October 23rd, and British troops participated in the attack on the Rafah area. On November 2nd, the British air force strafed Gaza City.

He further said that it has also been ascertained that the troops occupying Gaza City included British and French armed forces, and that Israeli troops only arrived five hours after British and French troops occupied the city. The British and French only left the city after the Israeli troops arrived.

He said that, in addition, it has become clear that French "Mystère" jet fighters with Israeli markings participated in the fighting. Finally, radio telegrams proving close cooperation between French and Israeli troops have also been intercepted.

    新华社22日讯　纽约消息：叙利亚外交部长赛拉哈丁·比塔尔21日打电报给联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德，指责以色列勾结英法在叙利亚和约旦的边界集结军队企图侵略。
    比塔尔的电报说：“尽管联合国大会通过停火的决议，以色列一直在叙利亚—以色列边境线和约旦—以色列边境线上集结军队。法国和英国的部队同以色列军队一道参加了这种军事行动。法—英—以这种联合的行动再次威胁了中东的和平和安全。这表明那些正在实行侵略的国家的侵略意图。我请求你把这些事实提到安全理事会和联合国大会上去。叙利亚政府希望联合国大会能够立刻审议这些事实。”
    新华社22日讯　据塔斯社大马士革21日讯：叙利亚外交部发言人向报界发表声明说，已经判明，英法军队曾经积极参加以色列军队在西奈半岛的战役。
    他说，例如，据可靠消息，英法军队在10月23日已经被运到以色列港口海法，英国军队参加了对拉法地区的进攻，11月2日英国海空军扫射了加沙市。
    他又说，也已经查明，占领加沙市的军队中有英国和法国的武装部队，而且以色列军队在英法军队占领这个城市五小时以后才来到。以色列军队到达以后，英国人和法国人才离开这个城市。
    他说，此外，已经弄清楚，用以色列标志的法国“神秘式”喷气战斗机曾经参加战斗。最后，还曾截获证明法国军队和以色列军队紧密配合行动的无线电报。
