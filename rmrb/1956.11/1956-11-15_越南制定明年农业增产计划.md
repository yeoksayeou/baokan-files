Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, November 14th: The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has formulated policies and specific measures to promote agricultural production in 1957, preparing to vigorously encourage the production of grain and cash crops.

    The agricultural production conference convened by the Prime Minister's Office of Vietnam, with representatives from relevant central agricultural and forestry, financial and economic, commercial, and banking institutions, as well as administrative committees from various inter-zones and provinces, made the above decision after seven days of discussion.

    The conference, which ended yesterday, focused on discussing and formulating policies to encourage the production of grain (rice and corn) and cash crops (especially cotton, tobacco, sugarcane, hemp, tea, peanuts, sesame, etc.), and also formulated policies on developing animal husbandry. The meeting also studied the issue of rationally adjusting the purchase prices of agricultural products in order to appropriately take care of the interests of farmers and encourage production.

    According to information from relevant sources, the planting plans for cotton, coffee, and other cash crops in northern Vietnam this year have not been completed, but the rice situation is particularly good. Both the summer and early rice crops have been bountiful. The autumn rice, which is about to be harvested on a large scale, is also certain to be a bumper crop. Northern Vietnam can change the grain shortage situation of previous years this year and achieve self-sufficiency in grain.

    越南制定明年农业增产计划
    新华社河内14日电　越南民主共和国政府已经制定了推进1957年农业生产的政策和具体措施，准备大力鼓励粮食和经济作物的生产。
    由越南总理府召开的有中央农林、财经、商业、银行各有关机关和各联区、省行政委员会代表参加的农业生产会议，经过七天的讨论后作出了上述决定。
    在昨天结束的这次会议，着重讨论和制定了鼓励粮食（大米和玉米）和经济作物（特别是棉花、烟叶、甘蔗、麻、茶、花生、芝麻等）生产的政策，并且制定了关于发展畜牧业等政策。会议还研究了合理调整农产品的收购价格的问题，以便适当照顾农民的利益和鼓励生产。
    据从有关方面了解，越南北方今年的棉花、咖啡等经济作物的种植计划都没有完成，但是稻子的情况却特别好。夏稻和早稻都丰收。即将大规模收割的秋稻又完全有把握丰收。越南北方今年可以改变往年的缺粮情况，作到粮食自给自足。
