    川江 Will Implement Full Night Navigation
    (Our dispatch) The Chongqing Branch of the Changjiang (Yangtze River) Shipping Bureau recently decided to implement full night navigation on the 川江 River in the fourth quarter. After full night navigation is implemented on the 川江 River, tow-barge fleets can shorten upstream journeys by one day, and single passenger and cargo ships can shorten them by one and a half days. Each ship can complete one more round trip on the Chongqing-Yichang line per month.
    In order to effectively carry out night navigation, ensure the safety of ships at night, and improve ship turnaround rates, the Chongqing Branch leadership organized technical personnel from the dispatch office, technical research office, and ship management section to accompany ships, provide guidance, and summarize materials on night navigation experience. Twenty-six ships operating night navigation have been augmented with additional piloting personnel. Sixteen auxiliary searchlights have been added to ships such as the 瞿峡 and 长江2012 (Changjiang 2012), and another fifty-two searchlights will be added in the future.

    川江将全线夜航
    本报讯　长江航运局重庆分局最近决定在第四季度开展川江全线夜航。川江全线开展夜航以后，拖驳船队每次上水可以缩短一天，客货单船可以缩短一天半。每条船每月可以多走渝宜线一个往返复航次。
    为了很好地开展夜航，保证船舶夜航安全，提高船舶周转率，重庆分局领导上组织了调度室、技术研究室及船舶管理科等部门的技术人员，随船指导和总结夜航经验的材料。并在二十六艘夜航船舶中，增加了驾驶引航人员，同时又在瞿峡、长江2012号等轮分别添装助航探照灯十六盏，今后将再增添探照灯五十二盏。
