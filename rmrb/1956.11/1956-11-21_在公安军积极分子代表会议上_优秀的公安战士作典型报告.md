Xinhua News Agency, 19th: By this afternoon, sixteen border defense soldiers had given model reports at the Chinese People's Liberation Army Public Security Army Activist Representative Meeting.

Among the border defense soldiers who gave model reports were outstanding individuals who were good at uniting and mobilizing the masses, and exemplarily implementing the Party's policies, making the motherland's border defense an impregnable wall. For example, Huang Guihe, a reconnaissance员 (yuán - agent/scout) of the Yunnan Public Security Army border defense force, started by publicizing the Party's policies and educating the masses to win over the families of bandits, causing three bandit leaders who had been active on the border line to surrender and rehabilitate themselves. Border defense soldier Song Zhanxun, in the ethnic minority areas of the Yunnan border, mobilized the masses to find water sources, solving the drinking water difficulties of the local people, mediated ethnic disputes, and ended the quarrels and armed fights between ethnic groups; thereby mobilizing the masses to carry out the struggle against the enemy and winning over five bandit leaders to surrender. Mao Houzhi, a reconnaissance staff officer of the Fujian front border defense force, in order to carry out reconnaissance work in the coastal areas, helped the masses accumulate fertilizer and build water conservancy projects, gaining the enthusiastic support and help of the masses, and uncovered counter-revolutionary elements.

Among the border defense soldiers who gave model reports were outstanding individuals who always maintained a high degree of vigilance, and fought against special agents, counter-revolutionary elements, and Chiang Kai-shek's army with resourcefulness, flexibility, bravery, and tenacity. Li Zihui, an inspector at a border inspection station in Guangzhou, in more than three years, uncovered four special agents who had sneaked into mainland China and thirty-four counter-revolutionary elements who attempted to escape abroad. Zhao Liansong, a reconnaissance staff officer of the Guangzhou Public Security Army, has tracked down more than one hundred special agents and other criminals in more than three years. Ji Xuelin, a soldier of the East China Public Security Escort Detachment, during an escort mission, the ship was attacked by eight Chiang Kai-shek aircraft, he bravely persisted in the battle, and later, with the support of the air force, repelled the Chiang Kai-shek aircraft.

Among the border defense soldiers who gave model reports, there were also outstanding individuals who overcame various natural conditions and material difficulties on the long border line of the motherland, and demonstrated noble qualities. Ren Shunju, the deputy squad leader of the border defense force stationed on the "Roof of the World," the Pamir Plateau, often lay in the snow for five or six hours in order to monitor the border. Border defense soldier Damulin, who was on duty on the Inner Mongolia border, often performed his duties in weather of minus forty degrees Celsius. Once, herds of horses and camels belonging to the Mongolian People's Republic ran into our country's border and were lost. Damulin and two other comrades brought six days of food and spent eleven days and nights in the uninhabited grassland, finally found the herds of horses, and returned them to the Mongolian People's Republic intact.

In the past few days, eight internal defense soldiers have also given model reports at the meeting. Among them were the soldiers who guarded the Xi'an Petroleum Depot. In a dangerous situation where an electrical fire broke out, they risked their lives to lead the workers to fight the fire, avoiding an explosion at the oil depot. There were also the soldiers who guarded the blast furnace of the Anshan Iron and Steel Works. Once, an accident occurred in No. 8 automatic blast furnace where fifty tons of molten iron leaked out. They rushed to the rescue regardless of their personal safety. Some had their shoes scorched, and some had blisters on their hands. Finally, they worked with the workers to remove the molten iron, ensuring that another blast furnace about to produce iron produced iron on time. Cai Dekuan, the squad leader of a certain internal defense unit guarding the railway, discovered the broken fishplates of the rails twice, and promptly notified the workers to repair them, preventing an accident. Once, a train caught fire, he soaked his cotton coat and took the lead in drilling into the burning carriage to put out the fire, and rescued more than 400 pieces of materials with other comrades.

At the meeting, there were also twelve outstanding public security soldiers who achieved outstanding results in training and work, and demonstrated a high degree of creativity.

    新华社19日讯　到今天下午为止，在中国人民解放军公安军积极分子代表会议上，已有十六名边防战士作了典型报告。
    作典型报告的边防战士中，有一些是善于团结和发动群众，模范地执行党的政策，使祖国的边防成为铜墙铁壁的优秀人物。如云南公安军边防部队侦察员黄贵和，从宣传党的政策、教育群众争取土匪的家属着手，使三个一贯在边境线上进行活动的匪首投诚自新。边防部队侦察员宋占训，在云南边境少数民族地区，发动群众找水源，解决了当地人民吃水的困难，调解了民族纠纷，终止了民族与民族之间的争吵和械斗；从而发动群众开展对敌斗争，争取了五名匪首投降。福建前线边防部队侦察参谋毛厚枝，为了在沿海地区开展侦察工作，帮助群众积肥和兴修水利，取得了群众的热烈支持和帮助，查出了反革命分子。
    作典型报告的边防战士中，有一些是永远保持高度警惕性，机警、灵活、勇敢、顽强地同特务分子、反革命分子以及蒋介石军队作斗争的优秀人物。广州某边防检查站检查员李梓惠，在三年多的时间中，查获了四名潜入我国大陆的特务分子和三十四名企图逃到国外去的反革命分子。广州公安军侦察参谋赵连松，三年多来追踪了一百多名特务和其他案犯。华东公安护航部队列兵季学林，在一次护航中，船只遭到八架蒋机的袭击，他勇敢地坚持战斗，后来在空军的支援下，打退了蒋机。
    作典型报告的边防战士中，还有在漫长的祖国边防线上，克服各种自然条件和物质的困难、并且表现了高贵品质的优秀人物。长年执勤在“世界屋脊”帕米尔高原上的边防部队副班长任顺举，为了监视国境，常常在大雪里卧五、六小时。在内蒙边防上执勤的边防战士达木林，常常在零下四十度的天气里执行勤务。有一次，蒙古人民共和国的马群和骆驼跑入我国国境走失了，达木林和另外两个同志带了六天的粮食，在漫无人烟的草原上渡过了十一个昼夜，终于找到了马群，如数交还了蒙古人民共和国。
    几天以来在会议上作典型报告的还有八名内卫战士。其中有保卫西安石油库的战士们，他们在一次走电起火的危急情况下，冒着生命危险带动工人救火，避免了油库爆炸。还有守护鞍钢炼铁厂高炉的战士们，有一次八号自动炼铁炉发生五十吨铁水外流事故，他们奋不顾身地前往抢救，有的鞋被烤焦了，有的手上起了血泡，最后终于和工人一起把铁水排除，保证了快要出铁的另一高炉按时出铁，警卫铁路的某内卫部队班长蔡德宽，两次发现铁轨的鱼尾板断裂，及时通知工人抢修，防止了事故的发生。有一次列车起火，他把棉袄浸湿，带头钻进烈火燃烧的车厢救火，和其他同志抢救出物资四百多件。
    在会议上作典型报告的，还有十二名在训练和工作中成绩突出、并表现了高度创造性的优秀公安战士。
