Dear friends and comrades!

Today, the great Chinese people and all those in the world who uphold freedom, democracy, and progress are commemorating the 90th anniversary of the birth of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the greatest revolutionary activist of the twentieth century and the great revolutionary nationalist of China.

The Soviet people know that Sun Yat-sen was a tireless fighter who struggled for the national independence and freedom of his people, and a passionate patriot who dedicated his life to the cause of liberating and revitalizing his beautiful motherland. Lenin commented on Sun Yat-sen with great enthusiasm, highly praising his activities and revolutionary achievements, calling Sun Yat-sen a revolutionary nationalist filled with noble ideas and heroism.

The political program of "Three Principles of the People" formulated by Sun Yat-sen and known throughout the world reflected the deep aspirations of the Chinese people. In his 1912 article "Democracy and Populism in China," Lenin commented on the Three Principles of the People, stating: "Before us stands a truly great ideology of a truly great people; this great people are not only adept at lamenting their centuries of enslavement, not only adept at dreaming of freedom and equality, but also adept at fighting against China's centuries of oppressors."

Based on the experience of his long-term revolutionary activities, Sun Yat-sen concluded that it was impossible to achieve victory in the democratic revolution and to end the rule of imperialism and feudalism without contacting and relying on the worker-peasant masses.

The founding of the Chinese Communist Party in 1921 had a great influence on Sun Yat-sen's later activities. It was as a result of this influence that the Communist Party and the Kuomintang led by Sun Yat-sen established cooperation. The common program of cooperation between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang was based on Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People, which at that time had gained new content, namely: anti-imperialist struggle, the establishment of a democratic republic, the elimination of feudalism, and the realization of the slogan "land to the tillers." Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People were supplemented by three major policies: alliance with Russia, alliance with the Communist Party, and assistance to peasants and workers.

Sun Yat-sen's greatness, as Comrade Mao Zedong said, lies not only in his leadership of the Great Revolution of 1911, but also in his formulation of the Three Principles of the People, which included the three major policies.

Sun Yat-sen was among the first to deeply understand the full significance of the great October Socialist Revolution that took place in our country for the Chinese people.

Sun Yat-sen had the utmost respect for Lenin. His sincere words spoken at Lenin's memorial service touched the depths of everyone's heart. Sun Yat-sen said: "In world history, for centuries, there have appeared thousands of leaders and scholars who spoke beautiful words, but never realized them. You, Lenin, are an exception. You not only spoke and taught the people, but also realized your words. You created a new country. You pointed out a path of common struggle for us. The many difficulties you encountered on your path are also the difficulties I encountered on my path. I want to follow your path, although my enemies oppose me, my people welcome me on this side. You are dead... but you, this great man, will forever live in the memory of the oppressed nations."

Until the last days of his life, Sun Yat-sen remained the most sincere friend of the Soviet people and an active advocate of Sino-Soviet friendship. In his famous letter to the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union, written on his deathbed while seriously ill, Sun Yat-sen said: "Dear Comrades! At this moment of parting with you, I wish to express my fervent hope that the dawn will soon break, at which time the Soviet Union will welcome a strong and independent China as a good friend and ally. The two countries will join hands in the great battle to fight for the freedom of the oppressed nations of the world and achieve victory."

Sun Yat-sen's prescient words have now been realized.

The Chinese Communist Party and the entire Chinese people, relying on Marxism-Leninism and maintaining great cooperation with the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, have been working to build a new socialist China for more than seven years. This is the best commemoration for our great friend Sun Yat-sen.

We are all clearly aware that Sun Yat-sen deeply hated the colonial system and oppression imposed on the nations of the East by the imperialist powers. Now colonialism is collapsing at an unprecedentedly rapid pace. Millions of people in Asia and Africa have gained freedom and national independence through tenacious struggles. However, imperialist and reactionary forces are still attempting to reimpose the shackles of colonial enslavement on the nations of the East that have just gained freedom. The current aggression against Egypt by Britain, France, and Israel is proof of this. Peace-loving people all over the world are unanimously condemning the aggressors and expressing their full support for the Egyptian people. The Soviet people and the Chinese people, as well as all peace-loving people in the world, have issued strong protests against this act of aggression. In the future, we will also stand on the front line of defending peace and support the Asian and African peoples who are defending peace, freedom, and national independence.

Today, on the occasion of commemorating the 90th anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's birth, the Soviet people, like the entire Chinese people, express their deep respect for the father of the Chinese revolution and the great son of the great people. His lofty achievements in revitalizing China will forever live in the memory of the Chinese people, and in the memory of all those who cherish national and socialist ideals.

Finally, I would like to thank the Chinese People's Government for making it possible for us to participate in the commemoration of the 90th anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's birth. Now I raise my glass and propose that everyone present drink to the health of the heroic and hardworking Chinese people!

### 在江苏省和南京市招待中央谒陵代表团宴会上  莫斯卡托夫的讲话

    在江苏省和南京市招待中央谒陵代表团宴会上
    莫斯卡托夫的讲话亲爱的朋友们和同志们！
    今天，伟大的中国人民和世界维护自由、民主和进步的人们，都在纪念二十世纪最伟大的革命活动家、中国伟大的革命民族主义者孙中山博士诞生的九十周年。
    苏联人民知道，孙中山是一位为了争取本国人民的民族独立和自由而奋斗的永不疲倦的战士，是一位把自己的一生都献给了自己美丽的祖国的解放和民族复兴事业的热烈的爱国者。列宁怀着极大的热情评论了孙中山，对他的活动和革命功绩给以极高的评价，把孙中山称为充满了高贵思想和英雄主义的革命民族主义者。
    由孙中山所制定的，并为举世所周知的政治纲领“三民主义”，反映了中国人民深切的愿望。1912年，列宁在“中国的民主主义和民粹主义”这篇文章中评论三民主义时指出：“摆在我们面前的是一个真正伟大的人民底真正伟大的思想体系；这个伟大的人民不仅善于悲叹自己成百年的奴隶地位，不仅善于梦想自由和平等，而且还善于同中国的成百年的压迫者作斗争。”
    孙中山根据自己长期革命活动的经验，得出了结论，这就是，如果不联系工农群众，不依靠他们，就不可能在民主革命中取得胜利，不可能结束帝国主义和封建主义的统治。
    1921年成立的中国共产党对于孙中山后期的活动给予了巨大的影响。正是由于这种影响的结果，共产党和孙中山领导的国民党才建立了合作。共产党和国民党合作后的共同纲领的基础是孙中山的三民主义，在那时它已获得了新的内容，即：反帝斗争，建立民主共和国，消灭封建和实现“耕者有其田”的口号。孙中山的三民主义补充进了三大政策，即：联俄、联共和扶助农工。
    孙中山的伟大之处，正如毛泽东同志所说，不仅在于他领导了1911年的大革命，而且还在于他制定包含三大政策的三民主义。
    孙中山是那些异常深刻地理解在我国所发生的伟大的十月社会主义革命对于中国人民的全部意义的最早的一批人中之一。
    孙中山对列宁是极为崇敬的。他在列宁逝世追悼会上所讲的真情的话，打动了我们每个人的心的深处。孙中山说：“在世界历史上，多少世纪以来，曾经出现了成千的领袖和学者，他们口头上讲着漂亮话，但是却从来也不去实现它，你，列宁，却是一个例外。你不仅说和教导人民，而且在实现自己的话。你缔造了一个新的国家。你给我们指出了一条共同斗争的道路。你在自己的道路上所遭遇的重重困难，也正是在我的道路上所遭遇到的困难。我要走你的道路，虽然我的敌人们反对我，但是，我的人民却在这一边上欢迎我。你死了………但是你这个伟大的人物，却将永远活在被压迫民族的记忆之中。”
    孙中山一直到他生命的最后时日，始终是苏联人民最真诚的朋友，中苏友谊的积极拥护者。身患重病的孙中山在弥留之际所写的著名的致苏联中央执行委员会书中说：“亲爱的同志！当此与你们诀别之际，我愿表示我热烈的希望，希望不久即将破晓，斯时苏联以良友及盟国而欢迎强盛独立之中国，两国在争世界被压迫民族自由之大战中，携手并进以取得胜利。”
    孙中山的具有预见性的话现在已经实现了。
    中国共产党和全中国人民依赖着马克思列宁主义，和与苏联及其他社会主义国家保持着伟大的合作，进行建设新的社会主义的中国的工作，已经七年多了。这就是对于我们伟大的友人孙中山的最好的纪念。
    我们大家都清楚地知道，孙中山是极为憎恨帝国主义强国对东方各民族实行的殖民主义制度和压迫的。现在殖民主义正在空前迅速地崩溃着。亚非国家的千百万人群在顽强的斗争中已经获得自由和民族独立。但是帝国主义和反动势力却仍然企图给刚刚得到自由的东方各民族重新戴上殖民奴役的枷锁。目前英国、法国和以色列的侵略埃及，就是一个证明。全世界爱好和平的人民都同声斥责侵略者，并对埃及人民表示完全支持。苏联人民和中国人民以及全世界爱好和平的人民对于这种侵略行为，发出了强大的抗议的呼声。我们今后也将站在保卫和平的前线，对于保卫和平、自由和民族独立的亚非各族人民给予支持。
    今天，在纪念孙中山九十周年诞辰的时候，苏联人民和全中国人民一样，对于这位中国革命之父、伟大人民的伟大儿子表示深深的崇敬。他为了复兴中国所完成的崇高业绩，将永远活在中国人民的记忆之中，活在一切珍爱民族和社会主义理想的人们的记忆之中。
    最后，我要感谢中国人民政府使我们有可能来参加孙中山诞辰九十周年的纪念。现在我举杯，提议在座的所有人为英勇勤劳的中国人民的健康而干杯！
