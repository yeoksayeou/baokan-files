    Preparing Conditions for Large-Scale Oil Exploration
    Huge Water Pipeline Network Completed in Mangya Area, Qaidam Basin
    Xinhua News Agency, Mangya, 12th – A huge water pipeline network has been newly built in the arid Gobi desert of western Qaidam Basin. Six water pumps and two water distribution stations have been built on the pipeline network. Now, all exploration areas in the Mangya area, except for the Dafengshan exploration area, can get a sufficient water supply. The water supply for large-scale construction this winter is also guaranteed.
    The water source in the Mangya area is very scarce. Hydrological geologists only found abundant underground water sources near the Mangya base, in a place now called Ziliujing, in September last year. However, all exploration areas are quite far from the water source. The Youquanzi exploration area alone needed dozens of trucks to haul water from Ziliujing every day. In mid-February this year, the Qinghai Petroleum Exploration Bureau transferred and recruited one thousand several hundred technicians and laborers to start building this water pipeline network. The pipeline network is more than 130 kilometers long and must pass through not only the Gobi desert but also cross mountain ridges as high as 200 meters, making the project very arduous. On November 10, Mangya held a grand meeting to celebrate the opening of the water supply. Forty-one advanced teams and groups and five hundred and fifty-nine advanced producers who emerged during the construction of the water pipeline network project were rewarded at the meeting.

### 为大规模勘探石油准备条件  柴达木茫崖区建成巨大输水管线网

    为大规模勘探石油准备条件
    柴达木茫崖区建成巨大输水管线网
    新华社茫崖12日电　在柴达木盆地西部干旱的戈壁滩上，新建成了一个巨大的输水管线网。管线网上已经修好了六个水泵和两个配水站。现在，茫崖地区除了大凤山探区以外，其他各探区的用水都可以得到充分供应。今年冬季大规模施工的用水也有了保证。
    茫崖地区的水源非常缺乏。水文地质人员去年9月才在茫崖基地附近现在被称为自流井的地方找到丰富的地下水源。但是，各探区距离水源都相当远，仅油泉子探区每天就需要几十辆汽车到自流井去拉水。今年2月中旬，青海石油勘探局抽调和招收了一千几百名技术工人和民工，开始修建这个输水管线网。管线网共长一百三十多公里，不仅要通过戈壁滩，还要翻越高达二百公尺的山梁，工程很艰巨。11月10日，茫崖举行了庆祝通水典礼大会。在修建输水管线网工程中涌现出来的四十一个先进队、组和五百五十九个先进生产者，都在会上得到了奖励。
