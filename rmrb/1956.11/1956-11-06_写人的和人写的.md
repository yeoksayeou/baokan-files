    Writing About People and People Writing
    Yu Ruhui
    Chinese has many idioms that are truly wonderful. Such as "兼收并蓄 (jiān shōu bìng xù)" [accept everything and assimilate it] and "集思广益 (jí sī guǎng yì)" [pooling wisdom brings broad benefits], each only four characters, yet containing endless meaning; "置之死地而后生 (zhì zhī sǐ dì ér hòu shēng)" [place in a death situation to live afterward] is a little longer, but still only seven characters.

    "兼收并蓄 (jiān shōu bìng xù)" roughly means that a person adopts and digests various different opinions as nourishment for themselves. "集思广益 (jí sī guǎng yì)" means that a person's cognitive ability is limited, and that many people thinking together is always better than one person thinking alone. "置之死地而后生 (zhì zhī sǐ dì ér hòu shēng)" has the meaning of "when things are exhausted, there will be change; with change, there will be progress."

    However, these wonderful idioms are often misunderstood or misused. For example, an article that writes all kinds of approving, opposing, and skeptical opinions together may be comprehensive, but reading it would probably make people not know what it's about. Or, for example, when writing a screenplay, the writer thinks of a story outline or writes a first draft, and then submits it for discussion. Person A says that a certain character should not die later, and Person B says it would be better if they died. The result of such "pooling wisdom" is that the character generally becomes neither dead nor alive.

    "置之死地而后生 (zhì zhī sǐ dì ér hòu shēng)" has also been used in our creative discussions. However, everyone felt that this saying was troublesome and too old-fashioned, so it was renamed "collective bombing." Collective bombing means that everyone does not have to worry about whether the writer can accept it in advance. Everyone, with a sincere and passionate heart, points out all the big and small problems they see. The idea is to first bomb the base of this work flat, and then hope that he can build a beautiful paradise on this ruin. But the result is that there is very little paradise, but many ruins are left behind.

    It should be admitted that literary creation always carries a great deal of independent mental labor. If Cao Xueqin and Gao E were both alive at the same time, and were both in the same creative institute, how to start *Dream of the Red Chamber* would probably be a very difficult topic to decide, and what Jia Baoyu should say when he first met Lin Daiyu would also be very difficult to reach a consensus on. Let's say we divide the work and Cao Xueqin writes the first draft, and then the two people reach a consensus and it's considered the final draft. Then, Cao Xueqin's pen would probably not be able to see Jia Baoyu and others, but would have to think about the leisurely Gao E at all times! Because he couldn't help but think, what if Gao E doesn't agree with this plot or this language, and raises twenty reasons?

    In the past, great literary critics mostly analyzed finished works, but today, before the movie script has even taken shape, some people are already eager to try. The writer's first draft is often mimeographed into dozens of copies and distributed to various committee members, bureau chiefs, and section chiefs for discussion. The discussion is not limited to one draft, some are two drafts, three drafts, or even more than ten drafts! Some discussions have changed the name several times. For example, a movie called "Defend the Fruits of Victory" has been called "Red Fighters," "Test," "Tempered," etc. It really has a nickname, a school name, a formal name, and even an alias! Some people say that if this film doesn't come out sooner, the protagonist of the film will later go to participate in the Korean War. Then the name would have to be changed again, adding at least a few words: "Defend the Fruits of Victory of the Chinese and Korean People."

    This sounds like I am opposed to the beautiful traditional practices of "pooling wisdom," but I am not. I am only saying that novels, dramas, and movies are about writing about people, and they are written *by* people. People are living things. Writers writing works are like women giving birth to children. Only after they are born do you know if the nose is short or the eyes are small. But at this time, the mother is already powerless. If the child becomes an actor in the future, the nose can naturally be heightened with putty, and the corners of the eyes can be drawn larger. But this is just makeup. Offstage, it is still a short nose and small eyes. If the midwives don't understand this, and insist on holding up a standard of beauty in the air, and operate while still feeding milk, what will the result be? Is it only masters who can imagine this?

    But unfortunately, in the field of literature and art, there are still many such midwives and masters. After major surgeries and collective consultations, they make comments: no "style," no "originality," "formulaic," "conceptualized"! There is a Sichuan dialect saying: "Three coins holding a paper tube, only the fortune teller's words are spoken, I have no say!" (referring to fortune telling) This feeling of "I have no say" probably represents the feelings of some writers—especially those in the film department.

    写人的和人写的
    俞如慧
    中国有许多成语，实在是非常美妙的。如“兼收并蓄”、“集思广益”，每句都只有四个字，却含义无穷；“置之死地而后生”这话稍长一点，但也只有七个字。
    “兼收并蓄”，大意是说一个人采纳和消化各种不同的意见，作为滋养自己的东西。“集思广益”是说一个人的认识能力有限，许多人一起来想，其好处总比一个人想的强。“置之死地而后生”，则有“穷则变，变则通”的意思。
    可是这些美妙的成语，也常有被误解或误用的时候。比如一篇文章，把各种赞成的、反对的和怀疑的意见都一起写进去，全面是很全面，但读起来恐怕就使人不知所云了。又如写一个电影剧本，作家想好故事梗概或写成初稿，便付诸讨论，甲说某个角色后来不该死，乙说死了倒好些，这样“集思广益”的结果，角色便大体成为不死不活的人物。
    “置之死地而后生”，在我们的创作讨论中也曾采用过。不过大家嫌这话麻烦和过于古老，更名曰“集体轰炸”。集体轰炸者，即大家事先不必管作家能否接受，都各人本着一颗赤诚而又灼热的心，把看到的大小毛病，一起说出来。意思是说，先把这个作品的基地炸平，然后希望他在此废墟上盖起美丽的天堂来。但结果是，天堂很少，废墟却留下许多。
    似应承认，文艺创作总是带有很大独立性的精神劳动。假如曹雪芹和高鹗都同时活着，而且都同在一个什么创作所里，红楼梦将怎样开头，恐怕就是一个很难决定的题目，而且贾宝玉初见林黛玉时第一句话该说什么，也确实很难取得一致的意见。便说分工吧，由曹雪芹先写第一遍，然后由两个人取得一致的意见，算做定稿。那么，曹雪芹笔下恐也就不大能看见贾宝玉等人，而要时时想到那个以逸待劳的高鹗了！因他不能不想，这情节，这语言，如果高鹗不同意，而且提出二十条理由，咋办？
    过去大文艺批评家，大都是分析已成的作品，可是今天，电影脚本尚未形成，便已有人跃跃欲试了。作家的初稿往往被油印数十本，分发各委员、局长、处长，开会讨论。其讨论又不止一稿，有的是二稿、三稿，直至十余稿！有的讨论几次，便连名字也换了几回。如一部名叫“保卫胜利果实”的电影，便曾经叫过“红色的战斗员”、“考验”、“千锤百炼”等等，真是有乳名、有学名、有大号、还有别号！有人说，如果这影片不早些出来，影片的主角后来还会去参加抗美援朝的。那么名字也就还要变更，最少得加上几个字：“保卫中朝人民的胜利果实”。
    这一说，好像我是反对“集思广益”一类美好的传统作风了，其实不是。我只说，小说、戏剧、电影，是写人的，而且是人写的。人是有生命的东西。作家写作品，宛如女人生孩子，只有生出来，才知道鼻子矮了，眼睛小了。但这时，母亲已经无能为力。如果孩子将来作演员，鼻子自然还可以用油灰加高，眼角也可以画大些。但这只是化装，下了台，便还是矮鼻子、小眼睛的。如果助产士们不懂这点，硬是空悬一个美的标准，于是一面还在喂牛奶，便一面动手术，结果将如何，这难道只有大师们才能想像么？
    但无奈在文艺领域中，这样的助产士和大师们还很多。他们在大动手术，集体会诊之后，就发议论：没有“风格”呀，没有“独创性”呀，“公式化”“概念化”呀！四川有句土话：“三个钱拈着纸筒筒，只有先生的话说，没有我的话说！”（指测字算命的）这种“没有我的话说”的心情，恐怕是很能代表一些——特别在电影部门中的作家的。
