Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, November 24th. The Native Produce Exchange Conference held in Tianjin concluded on the 23rd. During the seventeen-day conference, a total of 570 kinds of commodities were traded, with a total value of more than 58 million yuan.

In addition to representatives from 21 provinces and cities, representatives from supply and marketing cooperatives in more than 130 counties participated in this exchange conference. Representatives from supply and marketing cooperatives in various counties conducted free transactions directly with various units. The Zuoquan County Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Shanxi Province, which had a backlog of 400,000 jin of dried persimmons for a long time, quickly completed a direct transaction with the Tianjin Non-staple Food Management Office of the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives.

The transactions mainly involved rural sideline products and small local and special products. In order to support sideline production in disaster areas, many representatives gave priority to purchasing products from disaster areas. According to statistics, sideline products from disaster areas worth more than 14 million yuan were sold at the conference. Jinghai County in Hebei Province, which was severely affected by the disaster, sold more than 1.2 million yuan of straw ropes, various reed mats, and cattail bags, accounting for more than one-third of the total value of Jinghai County's sideline production this year.

Trade units in major cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and Shenyang purchased 33.51 million yuan of non-staple foods at the conference.

At the exchange conference, new sources of export commodities such as mountain rabbits, wild birds, and yellow sheep were also discovered.

    新华社天津24日电　在天津举行的土产交流大会23日闭幕。在十七天的大会期间，各地一共成交了五百七十种商品，总值五千八百多万元。
    参加这次交流大会的除有二十一个省、市的代表以外，还有一百三十多个县的供销合作社的代表，各个县的供销合作社代表这次直接和各单位进行了自由交易。山西省左权县供销合作社原来积压了很久的四十万斤柿饼，这次很快地直接和中华全国供销合作总社天津副食品经营处成交了。
    这次交易的主要是农村副业产品和小土产、特产品。许多代表为了支援灾区副业生产，都尽先购买灾区产品。据统计，在会上共卖出价值一千四百多万元的灾区副业产品。受灾严重的河北省静海县共卖出了草绳、各种苇箔、蒲包等一百二十多万元，占今年静海县副业生产总值的三分之一以上。
    北京、上海、天津、沈阳等大城市的贸易单位共在会上买进了三千三百五十一万元的副食品。
    在交流大会上，还发现了山兔、野禽、黄羊等一些出口商品的新货源。
