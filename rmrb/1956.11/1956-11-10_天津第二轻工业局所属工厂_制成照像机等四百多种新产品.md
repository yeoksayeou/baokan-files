Xinhua News Agency report: Factories under the Tianjin Second Bureau of Light Industry reached 1957's total production value level one year and two months ahead of schedule.

During the implementation of the plan, factories under this bureau strengthened their efforts to improve quality and increase the variety of new products. Especially in the first half of this year, the factories carried out mass quality inspections and promoted more than 700 advanced experiences, resulting in improvements in the quality of 26 major products. On this basis, the Second Bureau of Light Industry formulated a plan to improve quality and increase variety from 1956 to 1957, and put forward requirements for the factories to further improve product quality. According to an October inspection, among 63 products, 34 products, including ink, mimeograph stencils, canned food, and vegetable oil, have already met the 1956 quality requirements.

According to the plan, this bureau will trial-produce 337 new products and new designs this year. As of October, the factories have successfully trial-produced 441 types, among which the "71" brand camera, photographic film, shrimp canned food, and sunflower seed oil have significant economic and technical value.

    据新华社讯　天津市第二轻工业局所属工厂提前一年零两个月达到1957年的生产总值水平。
    这个局所属的工厂，在执行计划期间加强了提高质量和增加新品种的工作。特别是在今年上半年，各厂进行群众性的质量检查，推广了七百多项先进经验，使二十六种主要产品的质量有了改进。在这个基础上，第二轻工业局制订出1956年到1957年提高质量和增加品种的规划，并对各厂提出了进一步提高产品质量的要求。根据10月份的检查，在六十三种产品中，已经有墨水、打字蜡纸、罐头、植物油等三十四种产品达到了1956年的质量要求。
    按照计划，这个局今年要试制的新产品和新花样产品有三百三十七种，到10月为止，各厂已经试制成功四百四十一种，其中七一牌照相机、照相软片、对虾罐头、葵花籽油等都有很大的经济和技术价值。
