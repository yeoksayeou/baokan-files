    Don't Lose Big Because of Small
    Recently, the Jiangyou County People's Committee in Sichuan Province implemented a method of rationing pork. Pork supply is tight, and rationing is beneficial. However, this method stipulates that the monthly supply for cadres is more than twice that of the citizens. There may be some differences in the work and economic conditions of government cadres and the masses, but in the case of tight pork supply, it would be appropriate for government cadres to eat less and allow the masses to eat more than they currently do. Otherwise, if it only benefits cadres to eat more pork and is detrimental to the close ties between cadres and the masses, wouldn't that be losing big because of small? ·Fan Jishan·

    不可因小失大
    最近四川江油县人民委员会实施了一项定量供应猪肉的办法。猪肉供应紧张，实行定量供应是有好处的。但是，这个办法规定干部每人每月的供应量比市民群众大了两倍多。机关干部和群众的工作状况、经济状况当然会有些差异，但是，在猪肉供应紧张的情况下，机关干部少吃一些，让群众比目前多吃一些，也是应该的。否则，只是为了让干部多吃一点猪肉，而不利于干部和群众的密切联系，岂非因小失大？　·樊吉山·
