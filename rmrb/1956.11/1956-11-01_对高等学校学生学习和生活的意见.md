Opinions on the Study and Life of University Students

    Don't Allow Them to Drift
    After the start of the new academic year, the school took effective measures to reduce the study burden, and the Party and Youth League organizations also changed their past work style of overemphasizing collectivism, which played a positive role in cultivating students' independent thinking and personality development. Currently, most students can consciously manage their time, thus improving the quality of learning. Students are generally pleased with the changes in some of the school's systems, and everyone praises them.
    However, after this major change, due to insufficient publicity about the new system by school leaders, students have not been able to correctly understand its significance, so some undesirable phenomena have also occurred. At Fudan University, some students are undisciplined and absenteeism is quite serious. For example, in one class of over seventy students, twelve people have recently been absent for seventy or eighty hours. Some students do not cherish their time, going to stroll on the streets or chatting idly. Some are still making loud noises late at night, or playing the erhu and singing Peking opera, disturbing others' sleep. Several weeks into the semester, some students have not done morning exercises once or participated in any physical activities. Some students are also not interested in necessary political activities and unwilling to do necessary social work. In one grade, three out of four class leaders are unwilling to do it. Even some Youth League members are unwilling to participate in organizational activities. Cadres are afraid of being accused of hindering personality development and of repeating the past mistake of overemphasizing collectivism in their work, so they turn a blind eye to these phenomena.
    In this reform, the occurrence of these unhealthy phenomena is understandable and does not require panic or surprise, because school leaders did not clearly explain the significance of the new measures to the students. We believe that to correctly solve these problems, we should not doubt the changes that have already been made, but rather enable students to correctly understand the significance of these changes, explaining to them that personality development is not undisciplined and that reducing the burden of study does not mean becoming lazy. That is to say, comrades who are doing leadership work in schools must clearly recognize that cultivating students' ability to think independently and to manage their time freely does not mean allowing them to drift. To ensure that students become well-rounded individuals, the leadership must correctly educate, guide, and enlighten them.

    Solving New Problems
    This semester, in order to change the phenomenon of students' excessive study burden and poor independent work ability, the school leaders of our Beijing Petroleum Institute have taken many new measures, such as reducing class hours and allowing students to freely manage their extracurricular time, so that students have more time to delve into their studies. However, after doing so, many new problems have also emerged that urgently need to be solved. Currently, some students at Beijing Petroleum Institute have experienced chaos in their studies and their learning quality is not high.
    The new students are all very enthusiastic about learning, but they are unfamiliar with how to study at university. This is primarily manifested in time management. Many students adopt the method of burning the midnight oil or getting up early to catch up on their studies, often reading until eleven or twelve o'clock at night.
    On the other hand, some students sleep until after three in the afternoon and still don't get up, while others spend several nights watching movies and dancing. Slackness in studies is certainly not good, but increasing labor intensity does not necessarily lead to good learning. If we do not manage time well and improve learning efficiency, such chaos will make it difficult not only to delve into studies but even to keep up.
    Making a self-study plan can help us clarify the requirements of learning, know how to use our time each day, and achieve order and clarity. This is a good thing in itself. In the past, department and class teachers spent a lot of time helping classes draw up uniform weekly plans and distributing uniform forms for students to make plans. Such insistence on uniformity and numerous restrictions was certainly not good, but we should not, because we oppose this, fail to advocate that students make their own study plans. I feel that we should guide new students to make good self-study plans. Only when learning is normalized is it possible to further cultivate independent thinking.
    Teachers also bear a great responsibility for whether students learn well. Of course, every teacher will strive to delve into teaching methods and improve quality, but this is not enough. Only by frequently understanding students' foundations, levels, acceptance abilities, review, and problem-solving situations can we better improve teaching. In the past, this part of the work was done through class representatives to contact teachers, which may have been relatively one-sided. The main reason for abolishing the class representative system this semester is to allow teachers to closely contact students. However, in reality, this has not been achieved, and the connection between teachers and students is even more disconnected than before. The reasons for abolishing class representatives were not clearly explained to teachers, resulting in teachers either ignoring the situation or randomly grabbing class leaders to manage. This can easily lead to a disconnect between teaching and learning. This issue must also be properly resolved.

    Make Study Life Normal
    In order to better unleash students' potential in learning, allow students to consciously manage their time, and exercise their independent thinking and independent working abilities, the leadership of Fujian Normal University has made some new measures. This has had a good effect on students' study life, but due to the fact that some students have not well understood the spirit of the changes, some bad phenomena have emerged this semester. Some students believe that they can enjoy a moment of freedom, and that no system is necessary.
    Therefore, instead of better managing their time to delve into studies and learn more skills, they take the opportunity to frantically watch more movies. Some play mahjong and cards all day long, playing during morning self-study, in the afternoon, and after dinner until after lights out. This phenomenon has a great impact on study and work. Even more strange is that some students have become "armchair strategists," and one can hear their boring idle talk from morning to night, from the dining hall to the rooms. Some students even play the violin and erhu during naps or after lights out at night, and the loud music and singing awaken most of the students. Some students do not pay attention to public hygiene, do not clean their dormitories for days, and it is not uncommon to see clothes and socks thrown around. The phenomenon of not cherishing public property is also serious.
    In short, these bad phenomena intentionally or unintentionally disrupt normal study life and violate student conduct. It is hoped that the leadership will pay attention to this, take effective measures, and stop them in a timely manner, otherwise it will bring a lot of losses to students and the school.

    对高等学校学生学习和生活的意见
    不要放任自流
    新学年开始后，学校采取了有效措施，减轻了学习负担，党团组织也改变了过去过分强调集体化的工作作风，这对培养学生的独立思考和个性发展起了积极的作用。目前，大部分学生能自觉地支配时间，因而提高了学习质量。同学对学校有些制度的改变，表现皆大欢喜，人人道好。
    但是，在这大的变革之后，由于学校领导方面对新制度的宣传不够，同学们还不能正确理解它的意义，所以也发生了一些不好的现象。在复旦大学里，部分学生自由散漫，旷课相当严重。如有一个七十几人的班级，最近有十二人旷课达七八十小时，也有些同学很不珍惜时间，去逛马路，闲聊天。有的在半夜还大声吵嚷，或拉二胡，唱京戏，闹得别人不得安睡。开学已经好几个礼拜了，有的学生没上过一次早操，没参加过一次体育锻炼。有的同学对必要的政治活动也不感兴趣，必要的社会工作也不愿做。有一个年级，四个班长三个不愿意干。甚至有的团员连组织生活也不愿参加。干部们怕人说妨碍个性发展和怕再犯过去工作中过分强调集体化的错误，因而对这些现象也置若罔闻。
    在这一改革中，由于学校领导方面没有向学生讲清楚新措施的意义，发生了这些不健康现象，是可以理解的，不必要惊慌失措，感到奇怪。我们认为要正确解决这些问题，就不要因此来怀疑已有的改变，而要使同学们正确地理解这种变化的意义，向同学说明个性发展，不是自由散漫；减轻学习负担，决不是去做懒汉。也就是说做学校领导工作的同志，必须明确认识培养学生独立思考的能力，自由支配时间，决不是放任自流，要学生成为全面发展的人材，必须领导方面正确地教育、引导和启发。

    解决新问题
    这学期为了改变同学们学习负担过重和独立工作能力较差的现象，我们北京石油学院学校领导上采取了不少新措施，如减少上课时数，让同学们自由支配课外时间，使同学有更多的时间来钻研功课。但是，这样做了之后，也出现了不少新问题，急待解决。目前北京石油学院有些同学在学习上已出现忙乱和学习质量不高的情况。
    新同学学习热情都很高，但对于在大学里应该如何学习却是陌生的。首先表现在安排时间方面，不少同学采用开夜车、开早车的办法来赶功课，晚上看书常常到十一点、十二点。
    另一方面也有些同学午睡到三点多钟还不起床，也有把几个晚上都花在看电影和跳舞上去。学习上的散漫当然不好，但增加劳动强度并不见得一定学得好。假如不很好地支配时间，提高学习效率，像这样忙乱下去，不要说深入钻研，就是跟上去也很吃力。
    订自学计划，可使我们明确学习的要求，知道那一天的时间该怎样利用，做到有条不紊，心中有数，这本是件好事。在过去，系、班主任花了许多时间帮助班排出统一的周计划，发统一的表格让同学们订计划，这样强求一律、诸多限制，当然不好；但不能因为反对这个，连同学们订自己的学习计划也不提倡了。我觉得要指导新同学订好自学计划，学习正常了，进一步培养独立思考才有可能。
    同学学习的好不好，教师也负很大责任。当然每位教师都会努力钻研教学方法，提高质量，但还不够，只有经常了解同学们的基础、程度、接受能力、复习和作题情况，才能更好地改进教学。过去这部分工作是通过课代表来与教师联系的，这可能较片面。这学期取消课代表制度，主要的是让教师能密切联系学生。但目前实际上未做到这点，教师和同学联系比以前更脱节了；取消课代表的原因，也没有跟教师说清楚，造成教师要末就不管，要管就乱抓班长。这样很容易使教学与学习脱节。这个问题也要好好解决。　郑志德
    使学习生活正常起来
    福建师范学院领导方面为了更好地发挥同学们在学习上的潜力，让同学们自觉地掌握时间，锻炼独立思考和独立工作能力，作出了一些新的措施。这对同学的学习生活起了良好的作用，但也由于部分同学没有很好领会改变的精神，便在这学期出现了一些不好的现象。有的同学认为可以痛快地自由一下，一切制度也不必要了。
    因此，他们不是更好地掌握时间进行钻研，多学些本领，倒乘机拚命多看电影。有的整天打麻将、玩扑克，上午自习课打，下午打，晚饭后直到熄灯后还要打。这种现象对学习和工作的影响很大。更奇怪的是有些同学变成了“清谈家”，从早到晚，从膳厅到房间都可听到他们无聊的闲谈。有些同学竟在午睡时或晚上熄灯后还拉起手提琴、二胡等，嘹亮的琴声和歌声扰醒了大部分同学。有些学生不注意公共卫生，宿舍几天不打扫，衣服和鞋袜乱丢挂更不是罕见的事。不爱护公物的现象也是严重的。
    总之，这些不好的现象，都有意无意地破坏了正常的学习生活，并违反了学生守则。希望领导上加以重视，采取有效办法，及时加以制止，否则将会给同学和学校带来不少的损失。　绿水
