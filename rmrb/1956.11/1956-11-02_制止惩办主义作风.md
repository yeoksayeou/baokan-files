    Curbing Punitive Practices
    The local state-owned Baoji City Printing Factory in Shaanxi Province has implemented a system since July 1955: anyone who makes a mistake or has an accident will have their wages deducted according to the amount of the loss. From January to July this year, 35 people were penalized, accounting for more than 30% of the total number of factory employees. In March, technician Zhao Liqian cut two bundles of paper incorrectly and was fined 20 yuan. Tang Shiyu, a staff member of the business section, failed to hand over the printing orders to the workshop in full, causing an accident, and was fined 30 yuan.
    The factory leaders never investigate the causes of accidents, nor do they educate the workers. The workers are afraid of being fined, so they are constrained and apprehensive when they work. Some people would rather do less work to avoid making mistakes. Some technicians are afraid to take on apprentices for fear of accidents affecting them. Some people are afraid to accept technically complex and high-value product jobs. Workers who have been fined experience difficulties in their family life, bear heavier mental burdens, and cannot concentrate fully on their work, making them even more prone to errors. I believe that this punitive approach is extremely wrong, and I hope that the Shaanxi Provincial Department of Industry will curb it. Qiao Tingbi

### 制止惩办主义作风

    制止惩办主义作风
    地方国营陕西省宝鸡市印刷厂，从1955年7月开始实行一个制度：谁发生差错事故，一律按照损失金额扣罚工资。今年1至7月，就有三十五人受罚，占全厂职工总数30％以上。3月间，技工赵里千裁错了两捆纸，被罚二十元。业务股职员唐石禹没有向工房交清印单，出了一次事故，被罚三十元。
    厂的领导方面从不研究事故发生的原因，也不对职工进行教育。工人们生怕受罚，干起活来束手束脚，提心吊胆。有的人为了少出差错，宁愿少干活。有的技工不敢带学徒，怕出事故连累自己。有的人不敢接受技术比较复杂的和产品价值比较高的工作。被罚的工人因家庭生活发生困难，精神负担更重，工作时不能全神贯注，更加容易出差错。我认为这种惩办主义的做法是极端错误的，希望陕西省工业厅加以制止。　乔廷璧
