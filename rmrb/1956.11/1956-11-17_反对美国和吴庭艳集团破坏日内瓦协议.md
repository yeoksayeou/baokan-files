    Oppose the United States and the Ngo Dinh Diem Group for Sabotaging the Geneva Accords
    Li Shouqi
    The provision in the Geneva Accords regarding free general elections throughout Vietnam in July 1956 has not been realized to this day due to the obstruction of the United States and the resistance of the Ngo Dinh Diem Group. In recent months, with the support of the United States, the South Vietnamese authorities have not only continued to refuse negotiations with the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to arrange for general elections, but have also intensified various actions to sabotage the Geneva Accords in South Vietnam, posing an increasingly serious threat to peace in Indochina.
    The people of South Vietnam, like the people of North Vietnam, are determined to realize general elections and unify the motherland; however, the Ngo Dinh Diem Group completely disregards the will of the people, and on October 21, formulated a so-called "constitution," attempting to divide Vietnam permanently. Furthermore, in violation of the provisions of the Geneva Accords regarding guaranteeing the freedom and security of residents, they have implemented bloody suppression against the people of South Vietnam who demand general elections and unification. In the first half of this year, the Ngo Dinh Diem Group committed more than 380 acts of violence in violation of the armistice agreement, arrested more than 9,000 former resistance personnel and patriotic individuals who demanded general elections and unification, and killed and injured many people. Since July of this year, these acts of violence have only increased. Now, not only are the major cities of South Vietnam, crowded with military police, filled with an atmosphere of terror, but Ngo Dinh Diem's police and secret agents have also penetrated into remote rural areas, detaining patriotic residents, regardless of age, in entire families. The letter from the General Command of the Vietnam People's Army to the International Commission on July 19 revealed that nearly 200 families were detained in their entirety in the concentration camps of Dai Loc, Phuoc Trach, and Nhu Tap in Thua Thien Province alone. In Phu Yen Province, there are a total of 109 prisons and concentration camps filled with people. In Ba Trang Village in Quang Tri Province, 75 families from one village were all detained. South Vietnamese newspapers do not dare to discuss the issues of elections and unification, because they are easily met with the disaster of being shut down, arrests, or destruction. The "Tien Bo" newspaper in Saigon, because it published an article discussing the issue of Vietnamese unification and requested that the Vietnamese authorities send a delegation to contact the North, was destroyed by thugs sent by the Ngo Dinh Diem Group.
    In order to suppress the people, resist general elections, and create tension in Vietnam, the Ngo Dinh Diem Group is massively expanding its army with the support of the United States. According to the plans of the United States and the Ngo Dinh Diem regime, South Vietnam is preparing to expand its regular army to 175,000 men in 1956, while also establishing a "security force" of 75,000 men and many other armed organizations. To this end, they are using repressive and deceptive means to force South Vietnamese youth into the army. The Ngo Dinh Diem regime has also announced laws forcing hundreds of thousands of overseas Chinese to take South Vietnamese citizenship, attempting to conscript soldiers from among the overseas Chinese. At the same time, the United States and the Ngo Dinh Diem authorities, in violation of the provision of the Geneva Accords prohibiting the establishment of new military bases, have built many new military bases and airfields throughout South Vietnam. The propaganda apparatus of the Ngo Dinh Diem Group is also constantly conducting war propaganda, shouting "Northward March," and constantly carrying out provocations in the demilitarized zone near the temporary military demarcation line. From July 13 to the end of August this year, the military personnel of the Ngo Dinh Diem Group illegally invaded the demilitarized zone on 72 occasions, with a total of 235 people involved. Recently, the Ngo Dinh Diem Group even dispatched a fully equipped military police battalion to invade the demilitarized zone. They are openly carrying out serious actions in the demilitarized zone that violate the Geneva Accords, such as organizing patrols, encircling villages, cutting off traffic routes, searching residents, shooting and attacking fishermen, and arresting former resistance personnel. In July of this year, South Vietnamese troops also conducted provocative military exercises in areas close to the temporary military demarcation line, and South Vietnamese authorities recently illegally removed boundary markers marking the southern boundary of the demilitarized zone. As a result of these situations, the situation in the southern part of the demilitarized zone has become increasingly tense and chaotic, and the demilitarized zone is increasingly seriously threatened with being violated.
    These provocative actions of the Ngo Dinh Diem Group to sabotage the Geneva Accords are being carried out with the direct support of the United States. Not long ago, the United States openly colluded with the naval and air forces of certain Manila Treaty countries to invade Saigon Harbor and hold military exercises in order to intimidate the people of South Vietnam. Barrows, the head of the U.S. "economic aid" agency stationed in Saigon, openly announced that in the past two years, the United States has provided the South Vietnamese regime with 500 million U.S. dollars of so-called "aid," of which 320 million U.S. dollars was directly used for military purposes. In order to control the South Vietnamese army and encourage it to carry out adventurous activities, the United States has also illegally transported more and more military personnel and combat materials into South Vietnam. In May and June of this year, the United States sent an additional 320 military personnel to South Vietnam. In July of this year alone, several hundred tons of U.S. military supplies were transported into South Vietnam. On August 15, an American ship delivered nearly 1,000 boxes of ammunition and more than 100 tons of machine gun and light machine gun parts to the South Vietnamese army in Saigon. On August 31, another American ship delivered more than 1,000 tons of rifle and machine gun parts and other materials to the same location. The United States and South Vietnamese authorities are concealing these acts of sabotage from the International Commission in order to evade inspection. After the disclosure by the General Command of the Vietnam People's Army, the International Commission has recently confirmed six such cases.
    The United States and the Ngo Dinh Diem Group have been hostile to the International Commission in order to facilitate its sabotage activities, and have even repeatedly attempted to undermine and abolish this international monitoring mechanism. After the French Union forces announced their "withdrawal" from South Vietnam in April of this year, the Ngo Dinh Diem Group attempted to deny that it was the successor of the French government in implementing the Geneva Accords, refused to send liaison personnel to the International Commission and bear the expenses of the International Commission, and attempted to bring down this organization. Due to the condemnation of broad world public opinion, the Ngo Dinh Diem Group had to verbally express its willingness to "cooperate" with the International Commission. However, in fact, it is still using various despicable means to obstruct and sabotage the work of the International Commission. For example, when the groups sent by the International Commission conduct investigations in South Vietnam, the Ngo Dinh Diem authorities often use the excuse of "lack of security" in certain areas to restrict the monitoring activities of the International Commission. On September 11 of this year, when the International Commission investigation team went to the Duy Xuyen area to investigate, the South Vietnamese authorities assigned hooligans to assault Major Xuan Linh, the liaison officer of the Vietnam People's Army stationed at the International Commission, and the translator three times in a row, which once hindered the investigation work. Under the protest of the Vietnam People's Army, the South Vietnamese authorities sent people to "apologize" and "guarantee" that similar incidents would not occur again in the future. However, four days later—on September 15, the Ngo Dinh Diem Group created an incident of the same nature in the Vinh Trinh area. It can be seen from this that the Ngo Dinh Diem Group obviously wants to rely on this extremely bad means to obstruct the work of the International Commission, making the monitoring work in South Vietnam a mere formality. This is exactly the same as the practice of the United States directing Syngman Rhee to undermine the work of the International Supervisory Committee in South Korea.
    These actions taken by the Ngo Dinh Diem Group with the support of the United States are not allowed by the Vietnamese people and the people of all countries who uphold the Geneva Accords and are concerned about peace in Indochina. Representing the will of all the Vietnamese people, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is continuing to make efforts to fully implement the Geneva Accords. On August 10, Premier Pham Van Dong wrote to the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference, asking them to urge the South Vietnamese authorities to respond to the date of the start of North-South consultations and the deadline for the realization of general elections; if the South Vietnamese authorities continue to refuse consultations, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam requests the two chairmen to reconvene the Geneva Conference to discuss the implementation of the Geneva Accords. The Vietnam Fatherland Front issued a statement on October 26, angrily condemning the Ngo Dinh Diem Group's conspiracy to illegally formulate a "constitution." Regarding a series of actions taken recently by the South Vietnamese authorities and the United States in violation of the Geneva Accords, the liaison delegation of the General Command of the Vietnam People's Army has repeatedly written to the International Commission, requesting that these violations of the Geneva Accords be stopped. These demands of the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Vietnamese people are just and will receive the firm support of the people of all peace-loving countries.

    反对美国和吴庭艳集团破坏日内瓦协议
    李守基
    日内瓦协议中关于1956年7月在越南全国举行自由普选的规定，由于美国的阻挠和吴庭艳集团的抗拒，至今尚未实现。最近数月来，南越当局在美国的支持下，不但继续拒绝和越南民主共和国政府进行安排普选的协商，而且在越南南方加紧进行其他各种破坏日内瓦协议的行动，使得印度支那的和平遭受了日益严重的威胁。
    越南南方人民和北方人民一样，是坚决要求实现普选、统一祖国的；但吴庭艳集团竟完全不顾人民的意愿，在10月21日制定了所谓“宪法”，企图长期分裂越南，并且违背日内瓦协议中关于保障居民的自由和安全的规定，对要求普选和统一的越南南方人民施行血腥的镇压。今年上半年，吴庭艳集团曾经制造三百八十多起违反停战协定的暴行事件，逮捕了九千多名前抗战人员和要求普选统一的爱国人士，并且打死打伤许多人。今年7月以后，这种暴行一直有加无已。现在，不但军警云集的南越各大城市里充满了恐怖气氛，而且吴庭艳的警察、特务还深入穷乡僻壤，把爱国的居民不分老少整家地拘禁。越南人民军总司令部7月19日给国际委员会的信中揭发，仅承天省的大禄、普泽和汝集三处的集中营里，就拘禁着将近二百户家庭的全体人员。在富安省，这种关满了人的监狱和集中营共有一百零九个。广治省的八庄村，一个村子中有七十五户人家全部被拘禁。南越的报纸也不敢谈论选举和统一的问题，因为动不动就会招来被封闭、逮捕或捣毁的横祸。西贡市内的“进取报”，因为刊登了一篇讨论越南统一问题的文章，要求越南当局派一个代表团和北方接触，就被吴庭艳集团派出的特务暴徒把报馆捣毁了。
    吴庭艳集团为了镇压人民、抗拒普选和在越南制造紧张局势，正在美国支持下大规模地扩大军队。根据美国和吴庭艳政权的计划，南越准备在1956年把正规部队扩充到十七万五千人，同时建立一支七万五千人的“保安队”和其他许多武装组织。为此，他们正在以镇压和欺骗的手段，强迫南越青年入伍。吴庭艳政权又公布了强迫数十万华侨入南越籍的法律，企图在华侨中征兵。同时，美国和吴庭艳当局还违背日内瓦协议中关于不许建立新的军事基地的规定，在南越各地修建了许多新的军事基地和飞机场。吴庭艳集团的宣传机构还不断进行战争宣传，叫喊“北进”，并且不断在临时军事分界线附近的非军事区进行挑衅。从今年7月13日到8月底，吴庭艳集团的军事人员非法侵入非军事区事件达七十二起，侵入的人数共二百三十五人。最近，吴庭艳集团竟曾派遣一个装备齐全的宪兵大队侵入非军事区。他们公然在非军事区进行着组织巡逻、包围村落、截断来往路径、搜索居民、对渔民进行射击和行凶、逮捕前抗战人员等等严重的违反日内瓦协议的行动。今年7月，南越的军队还在靠近临时军事分界线的地区进行挑衅性的军事演习，南越当局最近还非法地撤去标明非军事区南面界限的界标。由于这些情况，非军事区南部的局势已经日益紧张和混乱，非军事区越来越严重地遭到被侵犯的威胁。
    吴庭艳集团的这些破坏日内瓦协议的挑衅行动，是在美国直接支持下进行的。不久以前，美国公然纠合某些马尼拉条约国家的海空军，侵入西贡港口举行军事演习，以恫吓南越人民。美国派驻西贡的“经济援助”机关负责人巴罗斯公然宣布，在过去两年中，美国曾给予南越政权五亿美元的所谓“援助”，其中有三亿二千万美元是直接用在军事方面。为了控制南越军队和鼓励它进行冒险活动，美国非法地运入南越的军事人员和作战物资也越来越多了。在今年五、六月中，美国曾增派三百二十名军事人员进入南越。光是在今年7月份就有几百吨美国军用物资运入越南南方。8月15日有一艘美国船把近一千箱弹药和一百多吨机枪和轻机枪的配件在西贡运交南越军队。8月31日又一艘美国船在同一地点运入一千多吨步枪和机枪的配件和其他物资。美国和南越当局在进行这些破坏活动时，隐瞒着国际委员会，以逃避检查。经过越南人民军总司令部的揭发，最近国际委员会已证实了六个这样的案件。
    美国和吴庭艳集团为了便于它进行破坏活动，一直是敌视国际委员会的，甚至一再企图破坏和取消这个国际监察机构。今年4月法兰西联邦部队宣布从南越“撤退”后，吴庭艳集团曾企图否认它是法国政府在执行日内瓦协议方面的继承人，拒绝向国际委员会派联络人员并负担国际委员会的经费，企图把这个组织搞垮。由于世界广大舆论的谴责，吴庭艳集团才不得不在口头上表示它愿意和国际委员会“合作”。可是，事实上，它还是在用各种卑劣手段阻挠和破坏国际委员会的工作。例如国际委员会派出的小组在南越进行调查的时候，吴庭艳当局常以某些地区“缺乏安全”为借口，限制国际委员会的监察活动。在今年9月11日，当国际委员会调查小组到维川地区调查时，南越当局曾指派流氓分子对越南人民军驻国际委员会的联络军官春灵少校和翻译员连续三次逞凶，使调查工作一度受阻。在越南人民军方面的抗议下，南越当局曾派人“道歉”并“保证”以后不再发生类似的事件。可是四天之后——9月15日，吴庭艳集团又在永祯地区制造了同样性质的事件。由此可见，吴庭艳集团显然是想依靠这种极端恶劣的手段来阻挠国际委员会的工作，使得在南越的监察工作变成有名无实。这同美国在南朝鲜指使李承晚破坏国际监察委员会工作的做法如出一辙。
    吴庭艳集团在美国支持下所采取的这些行动，是越南人民以及维护日内瓦协议、关心印度支那和平的各国人民所不能容许的。代表着全体越南人民的意志，越南民主共和国政府正在继续为彻底实现日内瓦协议而进行努力。范文同总理在8月10日曾写信给日内瓦会议两位主席，要求他们督促南越当局答复开始南北协商的日期和实现普选的期限；如果南越当局继续拒绝协商，越南民主共和国政府要求两位主席重新召开日内瓦会议，以讨论日内瓦协议的履行。越南祖国战线在10月26日发表声明，愤怒地谴责吴庭艳集团非法地制定“宪法”的阴谋。对于南越当局和美国最近进行的一系列的违反日内瓦协议的行动，越南人民军总司令部联络代表团已屡次写信给国际委员会，要求制止这些违反日内瓦协议的行为。越南民主共和国政府和越南人民的这些要求是正义的，它将得到爱好和平的各国人民的坚决的支持。
