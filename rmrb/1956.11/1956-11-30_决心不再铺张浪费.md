Response to Criticism

    Comrade Jing Dianmo, Secretary of the Copper Official Mountain Mining Bureau Party Committee, writes: The article "Treating Guests and Human Relationships" published in the People's Daily on October 18th, which criticizes our extravagance and waste and failure to cherish state property, is correct.

    On the other hand, in the spirit of seeking truth from facts, the following explanations are necessary. The article mentions that the Party Committee Secretary and Bureau Directors are all fond of eating. In fact, I often politely decline banquets, and only attend when it is unavoidable. Even the banquets with a four-jiao food subsidy, I did not attend every one. As for inviting reporters to lunch with old comrades-in-arms who came to the mine on official business to solve capital construction problems, these were all personal invitations, not using public office for private gain, and not "every meeting is a banquet." Of course, even if some of the details are inaccurate, it cannot reduce our mistakes. I am determined to correct the mistakes I have made.

专栏：对批评的反应

    决心不再铺张浪费
    铜官山矿务局党委书记荆典谟来信：10月18日人民日报登载的“请客和人情”一文，对我们铺张浪费、不爱护国家财产的批评是正确的。
    另一方面，为本着实事求是的精神，还需要作如下的说明。文中提到党委书记和局长们都好吃。其实有时逢到宴会，我本人多以婉言谢辞，不容推辞的时候才赴宴。就是补贴伙食四角的宴会，我也并未一一参加。至于有些过去老战友因公来矿解决基本建设问题，约记者共进午餐等事，都是个人招待，并非假公济私，也并不是“逢会必宴”。当然，尽管有些情节有失实之处，也不能减轻我们的错误。我有决心改正自己所犯的错误。
