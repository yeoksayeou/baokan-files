    New Research on "Li Xiucheng's Confession"
    The latest issue of the East China Normal University Journal (1956, No. 4) published an article by Nian Zimin and Shu Shicheng, "Discussion on the Authenticity of the 'Original Manuscript of the Autobiography of Prince Zhong,'" raising new opinions on the authenticity of the confession of Li Xiucheng, the Prince Zhong of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, which are worth studying and discussing.
    There have always been many doubts about the authenticity of Li Xiucheng's confession. Since Luo Ergang, based on the original manuscript of the confession kept by the Zeng family of Xiangxiang, researched and renamed it "Original Manuscript of the Autobiography of Zhong Wang Li Xiucheng," everyone has regarded it as credible history of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom and an important historical source.
    Nian Zimin questioned Luo Ergang's research, believing that Li Xiucheng's confession was actually forged by Zeng Guofan. His reasons are: First, the handwriting of Li Xiucheng's confession and another so-called "handwritten answer" does not match the handwriting of Prince Zhong's only extant writing, "Zhong Wang's Edict to Li Zhaoshou in Handwriting." Second, Luo Ergang believes that the writing time of the confession started on July 30, 1864, and ended on August 7, but according to the printed diary of Zeng Guofan, the confession already existed before July 29. Moreover, the current content of the confession is full of humble and begging words, which is not in line with Li Xiucheng's heroic and unyielding character. At that time, Li Xiucheng was injured after being captured and had a low level of education, so it was impossible for him to write 7,000 words of confession a day. In addition, there are still some loopholes in the current confession in terms of wording and content.
    Nian Zimin believes that the reason why Zeng Guofan forged Li Xiucheng's confession was because the original confession of Prince Zhong exposed many scandals of Zeng Guofan, including falsely reporting military exploits and looting the national treasury of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom. Zeng Guofan was afraid of triggering investigations by the Qing court. In addition, he also wanted to use the forged confession to disintegrate the revolutionary forces at that time. Nian Zimin also raised different opinions on Luo Ergang's view that Li Xiucheng used the confession to pretend to surrender.
    In addition to agreeing with Nian Zimin's opinions, Shu Shicheng also made some supplements. (Rui)

### 对“李秀成供词”的新考证

    对“李秀成供词”的新考证
    最近一期的华东师范大学学报上（1956年第四期），发表了年子敏、束世澂的“关于‘忠王自传原稿’真伪问题的商榷”一文，对太平天国忠王李秀成供词的真伪问题提出了新的意见，值得大家研究和讨论。
    关于李秀成供词的真伪，向来疑问很多。自从经过罗尔纲根据湘乡曾氏所藏供词原稿加以考证，改称“忠王李秀成自传原稿”以后，大家认为它是太平天国信史，成为重要的史料。
    年子敏对罗尔纲的考证提出疑问，认为李秀成供词实出自曾国藩的伪造。他的理由是：一、李秀成供词和另一所谓“亲笔答词”的笔迹同目前忠王唯一的遗墨“忠王谕李昭寿手书”的笔迹不符。二、罗尔纲认为供词的写作时间起于1864年7月30日，迄于8月7日，但根据影印的曾国藩日记，在7月29日前已有了供词。而且现有供词的内容充满卑躬乞降的词句，不合李秀成英勇不屈的性格。当时，李秀成被俘后身受伤害，文化程度不高，因此他也不可能日写七千字的供词。此外现有供词在用字和内容方面都还有一些漏洞。
    年子敏认为曾国藩所以要伪造李秀成的供词，是由于忠王原供揭穿曾国藩的许多丑事，包括假报军功、抢劫太平天国国库等，曾国藩怕引起清廷的追究。此外也想利用伪造供词，瓦解当时的革命力量。年子敏对罗尔纲认为李秀成利用供词来假投降，也提出了不同的意见。
    束世澂除了同意年子敏的意见外，还作了一些补充。（瑞）
