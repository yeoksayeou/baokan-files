Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, November 13th: Intellectuals in Liaoning Province are participating in science popularization work with unprecedented enthusiasm, including broad mine engineers, university professors, scientific research personnel, etc. In Shenyang, Anshan, and Fushun alone, there are more than 7,500 intellectuals from all walks of life participating in the Science Popularization Association. Based on the workers' urgent need for production technology knowledge, they have carried out a variety of lectures and publicity. Currently, in Benxi and Fushun, the technical lectures held for workers cover eight types including mining and metallurgy, fuel, electricity, and geology and geography, attracting a very wide audience. Intellectual circles in Shenyang City make use of the Cultural Palace every week to disseminate new operating methods and new production experiences to the workers. From February this year to the present, they have given popular explanations of more than 130 advanced technical experiences to workers in various factories throughout the city. Members of the Science Popularization Association of the state-owned Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Factory, etc., explained to workers in various factories in the city the "New Method of Welding Hard Alloy Tools," "Tide Mold Tide Core Sand Casting," and "Adding Iron Oxide to Melting Furnaces" and other methods that were successfully tested in their own factories. After listening to the explanation of the "New Method of Welding Hard Alloy Tools," workers at the Shenyang Railway Signal Factory quickly applied it to production. The life of hard alloy tools welded by them using this method was more than doubled compared to the past.

By the beginning of October, eighty science popularization member work groups had been established in factories and mines in various cities throughout the province, preparing to further integrate with production for science popularization work. Now many factories are conducting independent science popularization publicity tailored to the needs of their own factories. The Shenyang Foundry, in response to the poor quality of its products, held seventeen classes for workers, systematically explaining the scientific principles of the process regulations. More than 400 workers from the entire factory participated in the study, enabling the process regulations to be fully implemented throughout the factory, and the scrap rate of castings dropped from 13.94% to 7.95%.

    辽宁知识界广泛宣传科学知识
    新华社沈阳13日电　辽宁省参加科学普及工作的知识分子空前踊跃，其中包括广矿工程师、大学教授、科学研究人员等。仅沈阳、鞍山、抚顺三市参加科学普及协会的各界知识分子就有七千五百多人。他们根据工人对生产技术知识的迫切需要，开展了多种多样的讲演宣传。本溪、抚顺两市目前给工人举办的技术讲座，有矿冶、燃料、电力、地质地理等八种，吸引着极广泛的听众。沈阳市知识界每周都利用文化宫向工人群众传播新的操作方法和新的生产经验。从今年二月份到目前，他们已经向全市各工厂工人通俗地讲解了一百三十多项先进技术经验。国营沈阳第一机床厂等单位的科普协会会员向市内各厂工人讲解了在他们本厂试做成功的“焊结硬质合金刀的新方法”、“潮模潮芯翻砂”、“熔炉加氧化铁”等方法。沈阳铁路信号厂工人听过“焊接硬质合金刀的新方法”的讲解后，很快就运用到生产上，他们用这种方法焊接的硬质合金刀的寿命比过去延长了一倍以上。
    到10月上旬，全省各市在工厂、矿山已成立了八十个科普会员工作组，准备进一步具体结合生产进行科普工作。现在有许多工厂都在针对本厂的需要进行独立的科普宣传。沈阳铸造厂结合该厂产品质量低劣情况，给工人们举办了十七个班，系统地讲解工艺守则的科学道理。全厂有四百多名工人参加学习，使工艺守则在全厂得以全面贯彻，铸件废品率由13.94％下降到7.95％。
