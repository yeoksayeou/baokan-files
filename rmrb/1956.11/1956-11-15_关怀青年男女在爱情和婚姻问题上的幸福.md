    Caring for the Happiness of Young Men and Women in Matters of Love and Marriage
    By Jin Yukun, Our Staff Reporter
    “Without the sun, flowers cannot bloom. Without love, there is no happiness.” This is what Gorky once said.
    Love is indeed an integral part of a young person's happiness. However, frivolous love can only create unhappiness for young people. Unfortunately, this phenomenon of hasty unions is still quite prevalent among some young people. In a factory in Shenyang, a young man went through the entire process of falling in love, getting married, and getting divorced within a month. It turned out that this young man thought he was already "over twenty-five, and no one would mend his clothes if they were torn." If he didn't find someone soon, he would be a bachelor for life. Therefore, he indiscriminately looked everywhere for a partner. He happened to meet a rural girl visiting a friend's house, and without asking any questions, he insisted that his friend introduce them and get engaged. He even bought the girl many things and, without her full consent, begged and pleaded until they勉强 married. However, because the girl was too young and reluctant to leave her mother, she cried and made a fuss about getting a divorce less than a week after the marriage, and finally had to get divorced. Less than a month after the divorce, this young man seemed to have forgotten everything and was hastily holding his second wedding.
    This frivolous attitude is also reflected in the fact that some young people lack a sense of responsibility towards love and marriage, and滥施 love, maintaining "multi-cornered" relationships with many people at the same time. A female laboratory technician in a warehouse in Shenyang had been in love with eight people, engaged to four, and married to three. A female shop assistant in a store in Tiexi District, Shenyang, maintained multi-cornered relationships with more than a dozen young men, and was too busy every weekend, making phone calls everywhere to arrange dating times. Because she had too many "lovers" to meet, she had to follow a timetable, which people called the "reservation system."
    This frivolous love and hasty union have brought great impact on the families, work, and studies of many young people. Because the two sides lack a deep understanding and a solid foundation of love, married life is often not happy, and phenomena such as family discord, marital discord, and mutual distrust occur. Some people, because their union was very frivolous, are afraid that their spouses will frivolously unite with others. They strictly question their spouses if they come home late from work, and even resort to violence after they dance with someone. Due to improper or unsatisfactory handling of love and marriage issues, suicides and homicides occur frequently among young people. For example, some people's feelings are not harmonious after marriage, and the man suspects that the woman is having an "affair", even to the point of hysteria, and finally kills his lover and then himself. A deputy mayor of Shenyang told me that, according to recent investigations, about 40% of mental patients are caused by problems in this area. This cannot but be a social problem that deserves serious attention. Therefore, strengthening guidance for young people in their love and family life is of great urgency in the current youth work.
    However, the current situation is not satisfactory. On this issue, where young people are least likely to be calm and objective, and most prone to blindness and impulsiveness, it is precisely the weakest link in youth work. Young people urgently need guidance, but they suffer from a lack of it. Party, administrative, and trade union organizations often believe that this is only a matter of young people's "private lives," and they are busy with "more important things," and generally do not intervene unless something goes wrong. The Party organization doesn't ask, and the Communist Youth League can only complain behind its back. As for the Communist Youth League organization itself, although it has conducted communist moral education for young people in the past two years, it has mainly focused on opposing the erosion of bourgeois ideology and combating hooligans'勾引 of young people, and rarely involved issues of love and marriage. Because the Communist Youth League organization lacks due concern for this special issue of young people, and because the League cadres themselves cannot distinguish right from wrong on this issue, they often interfere where they should not, and push away what they should管,excusing themselves with "this is your lifelong event, you can only consider it yourself," and "the Party organization has no instructions, and I have no confidence," and dare not provide guidance.
    In addition to the influence of feudal and bourgeois ideology, the reasons for the abnormal phenomena among young people in love and marriage are also greatly related to the current lack of normal social interaction between young men and women and the inability to develop friendships between men and women. A common problem is that young men and women have very few opportunities to interact and make contact, and it is very difficult for them to establish normal friendships and understand each other. A factory in Jiamusi has more than a thousand unmarried female workers. In addition to production and learning, these young women also urgently want to get close to young men, make friends, fall in love, and get married. However, because the factory is twenty miles away from the city, they have very few opportunities to contact the opposite sex. Therefore, they hope that the leaders can help build "a bridge" so that they can have frequent opportunities to聯歡, get close, talk to each other, and communicate with young men from brother factories. However, some leaders of the factory are afraid that after the female workers get married, they will have to be "transferred out" or that having children will "affect production," and they do not allow them to hold聯歡 events with young men from brother factories, building "a wall" for the thousand unmarried female workers. Because it is difficult for men and women to interact, they often ask people to introduce them as soon as they come into contact with the opposite sex, and they rush into "love" and get married hastily soon after. The older they get, the more anxious they become, and the more hasty they act.
    One of the reasons that hinders the normal development of current social interaction between men and women is still the influence of the "men and women should not touch each other" and other habits. Therefore, some normal friendships and social activities between men and women are not only not supported by public opinion, but often suffer undue criticism. A common phenomenon is that as soon as unmarried men and women come into contact, there is an uproar everywhere, believing that they are "in love." Married men and women who come into contact or see a movie together are suspected of "messing around." It seems that there is no other relationship between men and women besides love. If so, how can normal social activities between men and women be carried out?
    Caring for the happiness of young men and women in their love and family life is the unshirkable responsibility of the Party, trade unions, and Communist Youth League organizations, and it is also the responsibility of society. At present, in order to eliminate the abnormal phenomena of young people in dealing with this issue, in addition to strengthening the regular moral education and specific guidance for young people, it is also necessary to actively create conditions for young men and women to carry out social activities, opening up the atmosphere of social interaction between men and women, so that young men and women have full opportunities for free interaction, mutual understanding, and the establishment of friendship and love. The solution to this problem is a great merit for the vast number of young people!

    关怀青年男女在爱情和婚姻问题上的幸福
    本报记者　金雨困
    “挨没有太阳，花就不能开放。没有爱情，就没有幸福”。这是高尔基曾说过的话。
    爱情，这确实是青年幸福的组成部分。但是，轻率的爱情，却只能为青年制造不幸。可惜，这种轻率结合的现象，在一部分青年中还相当流行。沈阳某厂有位青年，竟在一个月内经历了恋爱、结婚到离婚的全部过程。原来这位青年认为自己已经“年过二十五，衣破没人补”，如若再不找个对象，就得打一辈子光棍。因此就饥不择食地到处物色，后来偶尔在朋友家里遇到一位来串门的农村姑娘，他就不问情由地硬要朋友介绍订了婚，还给女方买了很多东西，在女方尚未完全同意的情况下，便苦苦哀求，勉强结了婚。但是，因为女的太年轻，还舍不得离开妈妈，婚后不到一星期，便哭哭啼啼，闹着离婚，最后不得不离了婚。刚离婚不到一个月，这位青年似乎什么都忘了，又在匆匆地举行第二次的婚礼。
    这种轻率的态度，还表现在有些青年对爱情、婚姻缺乏应有的责任感，滥施爱情，一个人同时和好多人保持“多角”关系。沈阳某仓库有一个女化验员，曾先后和八个人恋爱、四个人订婚、三个人结婚；沈阳铁西区某商店一个女营业员，同时与十多名青年保持多角恋爱，每到周末就应接不暇，到处打电话安排幽会时间，她因为要会的“爱人”太多，就非按表格时间进行不可，人们称之为“预约制”。
    这种轻率的爱情和轻率的结合，给许多青年的家庭、工作、学习都带来了莫大的影响。由于双方缺乏深刻的了解和深厚的爱情基础，婚后生活往往并不美满，家庭不和、夫妇不睦、互不信任的现象发生了。有的因为自己的结合很轻率，就怕爱人再轻率的和别人结合，下班稍晚就严加盘问，偶然和人跳一下舞，回来后就拳打脚踢；由于爱情和婚姻问题处理不当或不够称心如意，在青年中屡屡发生自杀和凶杀事情；如有些人婚后感情不融洽，男方就怀疑女方是有了“外遇”，甚至发展到歇斯底里的程度，最后杀了爱人，又杀了自己。沈阳市一位副市长告诉我，据最近了解：在精神病患者当中，约有40％左右的病因是由于这方面的问题而引起的。这不能不是值得引起严重注意的社会问题。因此，加强对青年们爱情和家庭生活的指导，在当前的青年工作中就有十分迫切的意义。
    然而目前的情况并不能令人满意，在这个青年最不容易冷静和客观、最容易盲目和冲动的问题上，恰恰就是青年工作中最薄弱的一环。青年们迫切要求指导，但苦于无人指导。党、行政、工会组织往往认为这仅是青年的“私生活”问题，他们要忙“更重要的事情”，只要不出乱子，一般是不加过问的。党组织不问，青年团也只好在背后发发怨言。就以团组织本身来说，过去两年中，虽然对青年进行了共产主义道德教育，但主要是反对资产阶级思想侵蚀和打击流氓对青年的勾引，很少涉及到爱情和婚姻问题。由于团组织对青年的这个特殊问题缺乏应有的关心，也因团的干部自己对这个问题的是非也分辨不清。往往是不应干涉的横加干涉了，应该管的却推出去不管，借口“这是你的终身大事，只能由你自己考虑”、“党组织没有指示，我心里也没有底”，不敢加以指导。
    促成青年在爱情和婚姻问题上不正常现象的原因，除了封建和资产阶级的思想影响外，还与目前青年男女缺乏正常社交、男女间友谊不能开展有很大关系。普遍的问题是：青年男女间交往接触的机会很少，男女间建立正常友谊，进行相互了解也就很困难。佳木斯某厂有千余未婚女工，这些女青年除了生产学习外，也迫切要求和青年小伙子接近、交朋友、谈恋爱和结婚。但因工厂离市区有二十里之遥，很少有与异性接触的机会。因此希望领导上帮助搭上“一座桥”，以便和兄弟厂的男青年经常有进行联欢、接近、谈心、通信的机会。可是工厂的有些领导人员怕女工结了婚以后，要“调出去”，或者生孩子“影响生产”，竟不让她们和兄弟厂的男青年进行联欢活动，为千余未婚女工筑上了“一道墙”。由于男女交往困难，往往偶与异性接触，就央人介绍，急迫进入“恋爱”，不久就草草结婚，年龄稍大的就更为着急，草率从事的现象就更多。
    妨碍目前男女社交正常开展的原因之一，仍然是“男女授受不亲”等习惯势力在作怪。因此，男女间一些正常的友谊和社交活动，不仅不能受到舆论的支持，却往往遭到了不应有的责难。常见的现象是：未婚男女只要一接触，就到处“起哄”，认为在“谈恋爱”了。已婚男女一接触或一同看一场电影，便有“乱搞”之嫌。似乎男女间除了爱情外别无其它关系。既如此，又怎能开展男女之间正常的社交活动呢？
    关怀男女青年在爱情和家庭生活上的幸福，是党、工会、团组织义不容辞的责任，也是社会应负的责任。在目前，要消除青年在处理这一问题上的不正常的现象，除了加强对青年进行经常性的生活道德教育和具体指导外，还必须为男女青年积极创造开展社交活动的条件，大开男女社交的风气，使男女青年有自由交往、相互了解、建立友谊和爱情的充分的机会。这个问题的解决，对广大青年来说就是一个莫大的功德！
