How I was Inspired and Moved by Mr. Sun Yat-sen's Patriotism
    Cai Tingkai
    The great pioneer of the Chinese revolution, Mr. Sun Yat-sen, made outstanding contributions to the country and the people during his forty years of revolution and should always be remembered and respected by the people. Mr. Sun's patriotic thought, revolutionary spirit, and noble personality have inspired, educated, and moved thousands upon thousands of people at home and abroad. In my childhood, I heard of Mr. Sun's great name – Sun Wen advocated revolution. Later, I heard the news of Sun Wen attacking Zhennanguan and the revolutionary party uprising in Huizhou. When I was thirteen or fourteen years old, I gradually understood some of the reasons why Sun Wen wanted to overthrow the Qing Dynasty. I clearly remember that in a small place in my county—Luojing Market—on market days, some people, under the guise of selling medicine, would give speeches to the rural masses about how corrupt the Qing government was, how it betrayed national sovereignty and humiliated the country, and how it persecuted the people. They said that if we did not overthrow this corrupt government, we would face the tragic disaster of national subjugation and racial extinction. The listeners were very moved. Although I was still young at the time, I gradually understood the seriousness of national subjugation and racial extinction, and I also knew some of the great principles of "national rise and fall, everyone is responsible." Driven by this patriotic thought, I decided to bid farewell to my parents, leave my hometown, and join the Guangzhou New Army to fulfill my ambition to serve the country. I also remember that Deng Keng (Deng Keng later became one of Mr. Sun's most trusted military men, serving as the commander of the First Division of the Guangdong Army) directly led me in this New Army. Not long after receiving training in the New Army, my patriotic thoughts grew stronger, and it was during this period that I joined the Revolutionary Alliance led by Mr. Sun. The Wuchang Uprising of 1911 was echoed by various provinces, and I also participated in the Northern Expeditionary forces. When Mr. Sun took office as the provisional president in Nanjing, I, like many others, thought that since the Qing government had been overthrown, the revolution could be considered a success, and China's future was promising. However, I did not correctly recognize that overthrowing the Qing Dynasty and destroying autocracy was only one stage of the revolution, and it could not be regarded as the completion of the revolutionary cause.
    After Mr. Sun resigned as provisional president and Yuan Shikai usurped power, Yuan went against the tide of history, killing party members and abolishing the provisional constitution, which caused shock and anger throughout the country. Mr. Sun raised troops to fight against Yuan. After Yuan's death, various warlords continued to cause chaos, harming the country and the people even more. Mr. Sun was heartbroken and took Guangzhou as his base, intending to overthrow the Northern Warlords, restore national order, establish a democratic government, and carry out construction. Unexpectedly, Chen Jiongming rebelled in Guangzhou, and the Yunnan-Guangxi warlords then occupied Guangzhou and started uprisings one after another. The imperialist-backed merchant corps also launched a riot in the rear. During this period, what I personally experienced and witnessed was the frustration of the revolutionary cause and the painstaking efforts of Mr. Sun. But also during this period, I deeply recognized Mr. Sun's great patriotic thought and his indomitable revolutionary spirit, which further aroused the love and respect of those who followed Mr. Sun.
    When Mr. Sun was carrying out the revolution in difficult days, the great October Socialist Revolution was successful. The Soviet Union and its people were extremely concerned about and supported the Chinese revolution. Therefore, in 1921, a special envoy, Maring, was sent to China to meet with Mr. Sun. Later, Mr. Sun and the Soviet special envoy Joffe issued the historically famous joint declaration. Mr. Sun welcomed Soviet assistance and cooperation with the Chinese Communists. Therefore, he established the three major policies of alliance with Russia, cooperation with the Communist Party, and assistance to peasants and workers. In 1924, he reorganized the Kuomintang and issued the declaration of the First National Congress, giving a new interpretation to the Three Principles of the People. At the same time, he called on comrades to learn from the "Russian-style revolution," saying, "In the future revolution, without taking Russia as a teacher, there will be no success." This was a high development of Mr. Sun's revolutionary thought, and it was also the correct revolutionary proposition he often said: "Suitable for the world's trend and in line with the needs of the people." At that time, except for some backward and stubborn elements within the Kuomintang who expressed doubts and opposition, the vast majority of party members wholeheartedly supported and supported these important decisions and measures of Mr. Sun. Therefore, the revolutionary situation showed a vigorous new atmosphere; the revolutionary action grasped the correct direction. During this period, the inspiration and education I received from Mr. Sun was extremely profound, and from this, I made choices about the direction and path I would take in the revolutionary cause in the future.
    Mr. Sun was firmly opposed to imperialism. He deeply recognized that imperialism was the deadly enemy of the Chinese revolution. In the Northern Expedition Declaration, he clearly pointed out: "The purpose of this battle is not only to overthrow the warlords, but also to overthrow the imperialism on which the warlords depend for their survival. Only in this way can the roots of counter-revolution be eradicated forever, and China can get rid of its semi-colonial status and create a free and independent country." Because of this major enlightenment of Mr. Sun, except for some insane people within the Kuomintang who recognized the enemy as their father, colluded with imperialism to sabotage the revolutionary cause, and endangered the lives of the Chinese nation; as long as people with a little patriotic conscience and national concept were moved by Mr. Sun and embraced Mr. Sun's teachings. For decades, I have never forgotten this major instruction of Mr. Sun, so when the Japanese militarists invaded our country and attacked Shanghai in 1932, my comrades and I of the 19th Route Army made the decision to resist Japan regardless of all difficulties and dangers. In terms of the situation at the time, although the outnumbered could not defeat the majority, and the weak could not defeat the strong; due to the outbreak of the Songhu Anti-Japanese War, the people of the whole country more clearly recognized the true face of imperialism and saw the crisis of the Chinese nation. After the full-scale Anti-Japanese War broke out on July 7, the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, showed a firm and unified will and exerted unparalleled strength. Later, they also received the assistance of the Soviet Allied Forces in the Northeast, and we finally defeated the Japanese militarists. Our great motherland was finally liberated. Just as Mr. Sun said in the Northern Expedition Declaration, "Create a free and independent country." All these vivid facts, which have been shown one by one in the two or thirty years after Mr. Sun's death, have proved Mr. Sun's great vision, correct thinking, and loyal service to the country. As a believer of Mr. Sun, I was fortunate to follow the direction indicated by Mr. Sun and embarked on the bright road. Now, on the occasion of the 90th anniversary of Mr. Sun's birth, when the people of the whole country are solemnly and warmly celebrating and commemorating, I make an inspection and recollection of how I have been inspired and moved by Mr. Sun's patriotic thought for decades, in order to commemorate Mr. Sun, and based on Mr. Sun's spirit of continuous progress, continue to work hard to move forward.

    我怎样受到中山先生爱国主义思想的启发和感召
    蔡廷锴
    伟大的中国革命先行者孙中山先生，在四十年的革命过程中，对于国家和人民作出了卓越的贡献，应该永远受到人们的怀念和崇敬。孙先生的爱国主义思想、革命精神和高尚人格，已使国内外千千万万的人们受到他的启发、教育和感召。我在儿童时期，就听说先生的大名——孙文倡导革命。随后又听到孙文攻打镇南关以及惠州革命党起义的消息。到了十三四岁的时候，我渐渐明白孙文要推翻清朝的一些道理。清楚地记得，在我县一个小小地方——罗镜圩，每逢赶集开市的日子，常有一些借卖药为名的人，对农村群众演说：清朝政府如何腐败，如何丧权辱国，如何迫害人民，我们如不推翻这个腐败政府，就有亡国灭种的惨祸。听者甚为感动。我当时虽尚年轻，也渐渐了解亡国灭种之严重性，同时也知道一些“国家兴亡，匹夫有责”的大道理。就在这种爱国主义思想推动之下，我决意拜别父母，离开故乡，投入广州新军，以遂报国志愿。我还记得，这个新军直接领导我的是邓铿（邓铿后来为孙先生最信任的一个军人，任粤军第一师师长）。我在新军受训不久，爱国思想日益增强，也就是在这个时期我加入了孙先生所领导的革命同盟会了。辛亥武昌起义，各省响应，我也参加过北伐队伍。孙先生在南京就任临时大总统时，我也和许多人一样，以为清朝政府既已推倒，革命算是成功了。中国前途有希望了。但没有正确地认识到：推翻清朝，摧毁专制，只算是一个革命的阶段，而不能视为革命事业就此完成了。
    孙先生辞去临时大总统，袁世凯篡夺政权后，袁即倒行逆施，杀害党人，毁弃约法，全国上下震愤，先生兴兵讨袁。袁氏死后，各方军阀，又相继为乱，祸国殃民，有加无已。先生痛心疾首，以广州为根据地，意在推倒北洋军阀，恢复国家秩序，建立民主政权，进行建设事业。不料陈炯明又在广州叛变，滇桂军阀，随之盘据广州，称兵作乱，彼仆此起。帝国主义者豢养之商团，又在后方暴动。在此时期，我亲身所历，亲眼所见，革命之事业受挫，先生之用心良苦，但也在此时期，我深深认识到先生的伟大爱国思想和坚忍不拔的革命精神，更加引起追随先生者对于先生的热爱和崇敬。
    当先生在进行革命艰苦的日子里，伟大的十月社会主义革命成功了。苏联国家和人民对于中国革命事业极为关怀和支持。因此在1921年就派有专使马林前来中国访晤先生，随后先生又与苏联特使越飞发表了历史上著名的联合宣言。先生欢迎苏联的帮助，欢迎与中国共产党人合作。因是确定了联俄、联共、扶助农工三大政策。并在1924年改组国民党，发表了第一次全国代表大会宣言。对三民主义作了新的解释。同时号召同志要学习“俄派之革命”，并说：“今后之革命，非以俄为师，断无成就”。这就是先生革命思想高度的发展，也就是他经常所说：“适乎世界之潮流，合乎人群之需要”的正确的革命主张。当时国民党内除一些落后顽固分子表示怀疑反对外，而绝大多数党员则对于先生的这些重要决定和措施，是衷心拥护和支持的。因而革命形势，呈现着蓬蓬勃勃的新气象；革命行动掌握了正确的方针。我在这一时期受到先生的启发和教育，是极其深刻的，并由此而抉择了以后在革命事业中所走的方向和途径。
    孙先生是坚决反对帝国主义的，他深深认识到帝国主义是中国革命的死敌，在北伐宣言中他曾这样明确地指出：“此战之目的。不仅在推倒军阀。尤在推倒军阀所赖以生存之帝国主义。盖必如是。然后反革命之根株乃得永绝。中国乃能脱离次殖民地之地位。以造成自由独立之国家也”。由于先生这一重大启示，国民党人中除了一些丧心病狂，认贼作父，勾结帝国主义来破坏革命事业，危害中华民族生命的分子外；只要稍有爱国良知，民族观念的人们，莫不受到先生的感召，服膺先生的教训。几十年来，我是念念不忘先生的这一重大指示，故当1932年日本军国主义者侵略我们国家，进攻上海的时候，我和十九路军的同志们，不顾一切艰难险阻，作出抗战决定。以当时的情况来说，虽然寡不敌众，弱难胜强；但由于淞沪抗日战争的爆发，全国人民，更加认识到帝国主义的真面目，看清了中华民族的危机。迨至七七全面抗战发动后，中国人民在中国共产党领导下，表现了坚决的统一的意志，发挥了无比的力量，后来又获得了苏联盟军在东北的援助，我们终于把日本军国主义者打垮了。我们伟大的祖国终于得到解放了。正如先生当年在北伐宣言里所说的：“造成自由独立之国家”了。以上这些活生生的事实，在先生逝世后二、三十年中，一幕一幕的表现出来，都证明了先生眼光之远大，思想之正确，谋国之忠贞。作为先生的信徒，我幸而遵守先生所指示的方向，走上了光明的大道。兹当先生诞生九十周年，全国人民正在隆重热烈地举行庆祝和纪念之际，我把几十年来怎样受到先生爱国思想的启发和感召，作一检查和回忆，用以感念先生，并本着先生不断求进步的精神，继续努力前进。（附图片）
