    Strolling in Palace Square
  　Zuo Zhao
    One autumn evening, I strolled in front of the Winter Palace. The cold wind blowing from the sea shook the leaves, and the autumn rain soaked my clothes. Few pedestrians were around, the streetlights illuminated the rain-soaked asphalt road, and the Alexander Column stood silently in the high sky.
    I have walked here more than once, but today I don't want to leave.
    I stood under the arch of the General Staff Building and looked at the Winter Palace. I thought of the famous painting "Storming the Winter Palace." Thirty-nine years ago, on either side of this square stood two opposing camps: on this side were workers, peasants, and soldiers; on that side were capitalists, landlords, and the parasites who lived off them. Palace Square became the focus of class struggle, and the fate of Russia was to be decided here!
    Thirty-nine years ago, the weather was even colder than now, and it was raining like this. Revolutionary assault teams were ambushed under this arch; there were workers from the Putilov factory, peasant children in military uniforms, and sailors from the Baltic Fleet.
    Night, the cold night of St. Petersburg. They waited in silence, waiting for the order from the Revolutionary Military Headquarters. They talked in low voices, they talked about who had seen Lenin...
    Suddenly, gunshots rang out in the quiet night.
    Bang! Bang!...
    They lay down under the arch. Mud, water, nothing could stop the attack on the Winter Palace. The gunfire became increasingly dense. They crawled toward the Alexander Column. A sailor had just raised his gun when a flying bullet hit his chest, and he sacrificed his life for the new world that was being born.
    A secret order was transmitted among the crawling assault team members: "When we see the red light and hear the cannons, we will start the charge!"
    A long wait.
    Suddenly, a red star flashed on the spire of the Peter and Paul Fortress, and then the cruiser "Aurora" fired the first shell at the Winter Palace from the mouth of the Neva River.
    Boom! Boom!
    The assault team members stood up, shouting "Hurrah," and began the proletariat's general offensive!
    Boom! Boom! The last fortress of the exploiters in Russia was breached.
    Boom! Boom! Workers and peasants broke into the Winter Palace amidst the sound of cannons.
    Thirty-nine years have passed, and every year on this day people flock to Palace Square to celebrate their own festival.
    Red flags flutter in the square, and people walk past the reviewing stand with joy.
    The assault team members who stormed the Winter Palace that year are already gray-haired, and they lead their descendants to participate in the parade. The children at the festival are the happiest, their eyes too busy to see everything around them, some playing with balloons, some sitting on their father's shoulders waving small red flags, with "October" and "Peace" written on the red flags...
    The youth team is the most active, with songs and laughter. Several Chinese young men stand together with Soviet youth.
    "Hey! Lao Wu, take a picture for us!"
    "Yes! After it's developed, we'll send it to our motherland, to Beijing!"
                      In Leningrad

### 漫步在冬宫广场

    漫步在冬宫广场
  　左钊
    一个秋天的夜晚，我漫步在冬宫门前。海面上吹来的冷风摇落了树叶，秋雨打湿了我的衣襟。四周围行人寥寥，路灯照耀着雨水洒湿的柏油路，亚历山大石柱默默地矗立在高空。
    我不止一次地走过这里，但今天却不愿离去。
    我站在军事总部的拱门下看冬宫，我想起了那幅“攻打冬宫”的名画。三十九年前在这广场的两边站立的是两个敌对的阵营：这一面是工人、农民和士兵；那一面是资本家、地主和靠他们生活的寄生虫。冬宫广场成了阶级斗争的集中点，俄罗斯的命运要在这里决定！
    三十九年前，天气比现在还要冷，也是同样的下着雨，在这座拱门下埋伏好了革命的突击队；这里有普及洛夫工厂的工人，有穿着军装的农民子弟，也有波罗的海舰队的水兵。
    夜，彼得堡寒冷的夜。他们沉默地在等待，在等待革命军事总部的命令。他们在低声谈论，他们在谈论谁看见了列宁……。
    静静的夜晚里忽然响起了枪声。
    叭！叭！……
    他们卧倒在拱门下面，泥啊，水啊，什么也阻挡不住对冬宫的进攻。枪声愈来愈密。他们向亚历山大石柱匍匐前进。一个水兵刚刚举起枪，一颗飞来的子弹打中了他的前胸，他为正在诞生着的新世界献出了自己的生命。
    一个秘密的命令在爬行的突击队员中传达：“看到红灯，听到炮声，我们就开始冲锋！”
    长久的等待。
    忽然在彼特洛巴夫洛夫斯克的塔尖上闪亮了一颗红星，接着从涅瓦河口“阿芙乐尔”巡洋舰向冬宫发出了第一颗炮弹。
    轰！轰！
    突击队员站了起来，他们高喊着“乌拉”，开始了无产阶级的总进攻！
    轰！轰！剥削者在俄国的最后一个堡垒被攻破了。
    轰！轰！工人和农民在这炮声中闯进了冬宫。
    三十九年过去了，人们每年到这一天拥到冬宫广场来欢庆自己的节日。
    广场上红旗飘飘，人们欢笑地走过检阅台前。
    当年攻打冬宫的突击队员已经头发斑白，他们领着自己的后辈们来参加游行。节日中的儿童最是幸福，他们的眼睛忙不过来看周围的一切，他们有的玩弄着气球，有的坐在父亲的肩上摇着小红旗，红旗上写着“十月”，“和平”……
    青年人的队伍最为活跃，又是歌声，又是笑声。几个中国小伙子与苏联青年站在一起。
    “喂！老五，快给我们照张像！”
    “对！洗出来以后我们寄到祖国，寄到北京！”
                      于列宁格勒
