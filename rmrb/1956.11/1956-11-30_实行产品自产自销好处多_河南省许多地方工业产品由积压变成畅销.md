Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, November 28th: Many local industrial enterprises in Henan Province have adopted the method of self-marketing their products, and many products that were previously backlogged have become bestsellers.

The local state-owned Jiaozuo Tannery used to have very good sales for more than ten kinds of leather. Later, due to catering to the local Livestock Company's subjective desire for exclusive sales, the types of products became fewer and fewer, making them unsuitable for market needs, resulting in large backlogs. After this factory switched to self-sales, it frequently investigated market needs, aligning its products with consumer demands. Now, the factory's products have once again become in short supply. The Zhengzhou Joint State-Private Hua Xing Thick Iron Factory produced more than 1,000 platform scales in the first half of this year, but due to mismatched production and sales, the exclusive sales department labeled them "unsellable," resulting in a backlog of three months, which forced the factory to reduce production by 80% each month. Recently, after the factory contacted relevant units in Shaanxi and Shandong provinces, it not only quickly sold out the backlogged scales but also received orders for 10,000 units. The "Tractor" brand cigarettes produced by the local state-owned Anyang Jinzhong Cigarette Factory used to sell well in northern Henan. However, the Henan Province Tobacco and Alcohol Monopoly Corporation transferred these cigarettes for sale to southern Henan, resulting in a shortage in northern Henan and a backlog in southern Henan. Furthermore, they did not pick up the goods from the production factory for a long time, causing the cigarette factory to accumulate too many products and unable to cover expenses. Recently, after the Anyang Jinzhong Cigarette Factory established a production and sales contract with the local monopoly company, the product sales problem was resolved. The "Golden Bell" brand batteries produced by the local state-owned Liming Battery Factory were all exclusively sold by the Henan Province Department Store. However, due to this company's "first-in, first-out" and "new goods don't leave the warehouse until old goods are sold out" operating methods, new products could not be timely presented to consumers. Moreover, a large number of batteries were stored for too long, causing the quality to deteriorate, which reduced the product's reputation among consumers, resulting in a large backlog of products. Since this factory switched to self-sales, this type of battery has not only become a best-selling high-quality product in the domestic market but has also been exported in large quantities to Egypt.

### 实行产品自产自销好处多  河南省许多地方工业产品由积压变成畅销

    实行产品自产自销好处多
    河南省许多地方工业产品由积压变成畅销
    新华社郑州28日电　河南省不少地方工业企业由于实行了产品自销的办法，过去积压的许多产品已经变成了畅销品。
    地方国营焦作制革厂，过去生产的十多种皮革销路都很好。后来由于根据当地畜产公司包销的主观愿望，使产品种类越来越少，因而不适合市场的需要而造成大量的积压。这个厂改为自销以后，经常调查市场的需要，使自己的产品跟消费者的要求相适应。现在，这个厂生产的产品又转向供不应求了。郑州公私合营华兴厚铁工厂，今年上半年生产的一千多台磅秤，由于产销失调，被包销部门加上“无处可销”的帽子，一直积压三个月之久，并且因此迫使这个厂每月减产80％。最近经过这个厂和陕西、山东等地有关单位联系以后，不仅将积压的磅秤很快地销光了，而且还接受了一万台的订货。地方国营安阳金钟烟厂出产的“拖拉机”牌香烟，过去在豫北地区畅销，河南省烟酒专卖公司却把这种香烟调销豫南，结果造成豫北脱销豫南积压。并且长期不向生产厂提货，使烟厂积压产品太多而无法开支。最近经过安阳金钟烟厂和当地专卖公司建立产销合同以后，又把产品的销路问题解决了。地方国营黎明电池厂，过去生产的“金钟”牌电池，全部由河南省百货公司包销。但是，由于这个公司的“先进先出”和“陈货不销光，新货不出门”的经营方法，一直使新产品不能及时跟消费者见面，而且使大批的电池积存时间过久质量变坏，降低了这一产品在消费者中间的信誉，因此造成了产品的大量积压。自从这个厂改为自销以后，这种电池不仅在国内市场上已经成为畅销的优等品，而且已经大量出口销往埃及。
