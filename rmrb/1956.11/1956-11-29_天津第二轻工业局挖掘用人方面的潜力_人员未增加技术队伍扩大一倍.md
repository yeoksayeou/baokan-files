Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, November 28th (Xinhua reporter Meng Fan): The Tianjin Second Light Industry Bureau has adopted a method of mining technical potential, enabling the technical personnel team to more than double in size.

The Tianjin Second Light Industry Bureau originally had 127 technical personnel, accounting for 0.6% of the total number of employees in the bureau. Recently, they held a technical professional conference for the entire bureau, promoted democracy, mobilized everyone to expose shortcomings in this area, conducted criticism, and mined potential. According to preliminary statistics, there are 168 technical personnel in the entire bureau who can be absorbed, promoted, or have their technical titles clarified.

The representatives attending this technical professional conference believed that in various professional companies and many factories, there were many cadres who directly led production and solved technical problems. Some lacked theoretical knowledge because they were from worker backgrounds, while some management cadres had theoretical knowledge but lacked practical operating experience. They were not all included in the technical personnel team. In addition, some factories had improper work arrangements for technical personnel, using them in areas unrelated to their expertise, preventing them from using their specialties. For example, the Heping Printing Factory transferred experienced veteran technical workers such as Wu Zhongqiu and Xing Bozhong from technical leadership positions to do personnel and statistical work. Some technical personnel who originally studied civil engineering are now doing accounting; those who studied electrical engineering are now doing general production management work, and so on. In joint state-private enterprises, such as the Tianjin Ink Factory, Chen Xingshan, a private-sector employee, worked with other technical personnel to improve product quality, making "Ostrich" ink a first-class product nationwide. Appropriate technical titles were not given to these private-sector technical personnel either.

During the conference, the leaders of the Second Light Industry Bureau and various professional companies investigated and studied this matter, adjusted the work of some technical personnel, and also promoted some veteran technical workers to do technical work, expanding the technical personnel team. The printing industry, which previously had no technical personnel, now proposes that as many as forty people can be promoted or have their technical titles clarified.

    天津第二轻工业局挖掘用人方面的潜力
    人员未增加技术队伍扩大一倍
    据新华社天津28日电　新华社记者孟帆报道：天津市第二轻工业局采取挖掘技术潜力的办法，使技术人员队伍扩大了一倍以上。
    天津市第二轻工业局原有技术人员一百二十七人，占全局职工总数的0.6％。最近他们召开了全局技术专业会议，发扬民主，动员大家揭发这方面缺点，开展批评，挖掘潜力，据初步统计，全局可以吸收、提拔或明确技术职称的技术人员有一百六十八人。
    参加这次技术专业会议的代表们认为，在各专业公司和许多工厂中，有不少直接领导生产，解决技术问题的干部，因为有些是工人出身理论知识缺乏，有些管理干部有理论知识而实际操作经验不足，他们都没站到技术人员的队伍中。还有些工厂对技术人员的工作安排不当，用非所学，不能发挥专长。如和平印刷厂把有丰富操作经验的老技术工人吴仲秋、邢伯忠等调离技术领导职务，做了人事和统计工作。还有些技术人员原来学习土木工程的，现在做会计；学电气工业的现在做一般生产管理工作等等。在公私合营企业中，如天津市墨水厂私方人员陈信善同其他技术人员一起，改进产品质量，使“鸵鸟”墨水成为全国第一流的好产品，对于这些私方技术人员也没有给予适当的技术职称。
    第二轻工业局和各专业公司的领导人，在会议期间，对这件事作了调查研究，并且调整了部分技术人员的工作，还提拔了一些老技术工人做技术工作，使技术人员队伍扩大了。过去没有一个技术人员的印刷行业，现在提出可以提拔或明确技术职称的就有四十人之多。
