    Prefabricated Houses Transported to the Gobi Desert
    (Xinhua News Agency dispatch) Recently, a large number of cold-proof prefabricated houses have been transported to the Gobi Desert construction site of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway, where the temperature is more than ten degrees below zero Celsius. After the automobile unloaded the various components of the prefabricated houses, the construction workers immediately erected the easily assembled and disassembled bamboo frames, installed the roofs and walls made of wool felt and canvas, and then installed the wool felt doors inlaid with glass. A few hours later, the prefabricated houses were assembled.

    Along the winter construction site of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway in the Gobi Desert, dozens of worker villages composed of more than a thousand cold-proof prefabricated houses have successively appeared.

    The cold-proof prefabricated houses were specially manufactured for the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway construction workers by workers in Harbin and Beijing. A prefabricated house for sixteen workers weighs only a little over half a ton.

    活动房屋运到了戈壁滩
    据新华社讯　在摄氏零下十多度的兰新铁路戈壁滩工地上，最近又有大批防寒活动房屋运到。当汽车卸下活动房屋的各种构件以后，筑路工人立刻把拼拆自如的竹屋架搭好，安装上用羊毛毡和帆布制成的房顶和屋壁，然后把镶着玻璃的羊毛毡门装上去。几小时以后，活动房屋就装起来了。
    沿着戈壁滩的兰新铁路冬季施工工地，陆续出现了由一千多幢防寒活动房屋组成的几十个工人村。
    防寒活动房屋是哈尔滨和北京两地的工人专门为兰新铁路筑路职工制造的。一幢居住十六个工人的活动房屋只有半吨多重。
