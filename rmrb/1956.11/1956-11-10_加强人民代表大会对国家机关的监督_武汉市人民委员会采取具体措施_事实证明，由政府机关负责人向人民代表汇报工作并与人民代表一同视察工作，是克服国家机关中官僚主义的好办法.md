    (By our own correspondent) Wuhan Municipal People's Committee, in order to strengthen the supervision of government organs by the People's Congress, has recently implemented a method of having heads of government organs report to the People's Representatives and inspect work together. This has played a significant role in helping and urging government organs to overcome bureaucracy and strengthen the connection between the government and the masses.

    At the Fourth People's Congress of Wuhan held in early September, the People's Representatives raised more than a thousand suggestions regarding the work of the government. Among these suggestions, many had been raised in the past, but because some heads of government organs did not attach importance to them and did not handle them seriously, many problems were delayed. Therefore, some representatives said when making suggestions: "I raised this suggestion at the previous congress, and this time it is still this suggestion. If the government does not resolve it again, I will raise this suggestion again at the next meeting," raising very sharp criticisms of the government. In response to this situation, the Municipal People's Committee held a series of special meetings, instructing various bureaus to seriously handle the opinions raised by the People's Representatives, and organized forces to specifically grasp and check this work. The Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party also issued instructions to the Party groups of various bureaus, emphasizing that the heads of each unit should personally take action, conduct in-depth investigations, strengthen coordination and cooperation, and be responsible for doing this work well. In order to truly understand the handling of the opinions of the People's Representatives by each unit, thirty People's Representatives were organized from October 15th to inspect nine bureaus, including civil affairs, health, education, real estate, and commerce, concluding on the 20th. All units attached great importance to this inspection by the People's Representatives, and before the inspection, they seriously handled many long-unresolved issues. For example, the People's Representatives pointed out that the supply of goods at Wuhan University was insufficient, and professors had to get up early to queue up to buy rice and meat, which hindered teaching. Wang Jian, Deputy Director of the Fifth Office of the Municipal People's Committee, personally went to the area to understand the situation and resolved the problem. The Real Estate Management Bureau also inspected and repaired six hundred and seventy-two houses and helped residents exchange one hundred and twenty-four residences based on the representatives' opinions.

    During this inspection, the People's Representatives also specifically assisted government organs in finding solutions to problems. For example, the representatives pointed out that the organization of buses on Zhongshan Avenue in Hankou was unreasonable and too crowded; at the same time, they requested that a station be added near the Children's Hospital. These two problems had also not been resolved for a long time. This time, the People's Representatives personally conducted on-site surveys with the Director and engineers of the Public Utilities Bureau, and initially studied a method to open up a circular route to reduce overcrowding on Zhongshan Avenue. At the same time, it was also found that approximately eight hundred to one thousand passengers boarded and alighted near the Children's Hospital every day, so a station could be set up.

    During this inspection by the People's Representatives, the serious bureaucratic style of leadership personnel in certain government organs was also specifically exposed. For example, the Director of the Civil Affairs Bureau gave the twenty opinions raised by the People's Congress to the bureau to relevant personnel, listened to reports, and thought that the problems were all solved. Later, the People's Representatives and the Director inspected the site together and found that not a single problem had been solved. This greatly surprised the Director, who deeply realized the serious harm of the bureaucracy of sitting in the office, approving official documents according to "routine," and listening to reports, and then changed his work style and seriously dealt with the opinions raised by the People's Congress.

    During this inspection, it was also found that the heads of individual units did not respect the inspection of the People's Representatives enough. When the People's Representatives went to the Health Bureau to listen to work reports, the Director of the Health Bureau did not report to the representatives, but asked the section chiefs and general cadres to report to the representatives. After the reports were completed, the Director also said: These situations are understood by the sections and are not the final opinions of the Health Bureau. This caused a lot of opinions among the representatives.

    Based on the situation of this inspection, the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held a discussion on October 29 and believed that having government organs report to the People's Representatives and inspect work together is a good way to overcome the bureaucracy of government organs, and decided to establish this work as a system, with inspections held once every month and a half.

    加强人民代表大会对国家机关的监督
    武汉市人民委员会采取具体措施
    事实证明，由政府机关负责人向人民代表汇报工作并与人民代表一同视察工作，是克服国家机关中官僚主义的好办法
    本报讯　武汉市人民委员会为了加强人民代表大会对政府机关的监督，最近实行由政府机关负责人向人民代表汇报工作，并与人民代表一同视察工作的办法，这对帮助和督促政府机关克服官僚主义，加强政府和群众的联系，起了很大的作用。
    在9月初举行的武汉市第四次人民代表大会上，人民代表对政府工作提出了一千多条意见。在这些意见当中，有许多是过去就提出过的，但因为有的政府机关的负责人不重视这些意见，没有认真处理，以致使许多问题拖延下来。所以，有的代表在提意见时就说：“我这个意见，在前次大会已提出过，这次还是这个意见。如果政府再不解决，下次会议我还提这个意见。”对政府提出了很尖锐的批评。根据这个情况，市人民委员会连续举行了专门会议，布置各局认真处理人民代表所提出的意见，并组织力量具体掌握和检查这项工作；中共武汉市委也向各局党组发出指示，强调各单位首长亲自动手，深入调查情况，加强配合协作，负责作好这一工作。为了切实了解各单位对人民代表意见的处理情况，又从10月15日起组织了三十位人民代表分赴民政、卫生、教育、房地产、商业等九个局去视察，至20日告一段落。各单位对人民代表这次视察很重视，在视察之前，就认真处理了许多长期未解决的问题。如人民代表提出武汉大学商品供应不足，教授起早排队买米买肉，妨碍教学。市人民委员会第五办公室王健副主任即亲到该地了解情况，解决了问题。房地产管理局也根据代表的意见，检修了六百七十二栋房屋，并帮助居民调换了一百二十四户住宅。
    人民代表在这次视察中，还具体协助政府机关找出了解决问题的办法。如代表提出汉口中山大道公共汽车组织的不合理，太拥挤；同时要求在儿童医院附近增设车站。这两个问题也是长期没有解决的。这次人民代表亲自和公用局局长，工程师一道实地勘察，初步研究出开辟循环路线减少中山大道搭车拥挤现象的办法；同时也调查出儿童医院附近每日上下车的乘客约在八百至一千人次，可以设站。
    在人民代表这次视察中，也具体暴露出某些政府机关领导人员存在着严重的官僚主义作风。如民政局局长将人民代表大会对该局所提的二十条意见，分别向有关人员作了交代，并听取汇报后，就认为问题都解决了。后来，人民代表和局长一同实地视察，却发现一个问题都没解决。使局长大吃一惊，深刻体会到过去坐在办公室里按“常规”批公文，听汇报的官僚主义的严重危害性，进而转变了工作作风，对人民代表大会所提的意见作了认真处理。
    在这次视察中，也发现个别单位的负责人对人民代表的视察不够尊重。人民代表到卫生局听取工作汇报时，卫生局局长不向代表们汇报，而要各科科长和一般干部向代表汇报。汇报完后，这个局长还说：这些情况是各科了解的，不是卫生局的最后意见。引起代表们很多意见。
    根据这次视察的情况，中共武汉市委员会于10月29日作了讨论，认为由政府机关向人民代表汇报工作，并与人民代表一同视察工作，是克服政府机关官僚主义的好办法，决定将这一工作定为制度，一个半月举行一次视察。
