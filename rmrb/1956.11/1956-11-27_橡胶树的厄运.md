Title: The Rubber Trees' Misfortune

Rubber trees are rare and precious plants in our country. In my imagination, the soil of rubber plantations must be ploughed very loose, and rubber plantations must be free of weeds. However, the fate of rubber trees in Yunnan is not like this.

Not long ago, while I was traveling near Mangshi in Yunnan, a companion suddenly told me, "Those are rubber trees!" I looked in the direction he was pointing, and saw weeds all over the mountains and slopes, with no rubber trees in sight. The companion ran into the weeds, which were more than two feet tall, and grabbed a withered, yellow sapling that was only slightly taller than the grass, saying, "This is a rubber tree."

I have seen many rubber trees on Hainan Island. The variety of rubber trees in Yunnan is the same as on Hainan Island, but here I did not recognize them.

Standing at the edge of that barren rubber plantation, I thought: why do the same rubber trees have two different destinies?

Five years ago, near the official residence of a Dai ethnic chieftain, two rubber trees in good condition were discovered. It is said that the chieftain's father had cultivated a small rubber plantation. However, when the rubber trees had just grown, the Japanese army barged in. The Japanese would not allow the Dai people to operate rubber, and at their command, the Japanese army cut down all the rubber trees. The two rubber trees that were later discovered were spared because they grew in other groves and were not found by the Japanese army.

"Rubber trees have been discovered in Yunnan!"

So, experts came. After the experts circled those two rubber trees a few times, they immediately built walls around the rubber trees. Thus, those two rubber trees were enshrined in the walls like idols.

"The subtropical areas of Yunnan are very suitable for growing rubber."

So, with money and manpower available, more than 10,000 cadres were immediately mobilized to set up rubber plantations.

So, a large number of agricultural workers were hired, a large number of production tools were purchased, slopes were dug, mountains were opened, seedlings were cultivated, gardens were opened and seedlings were transplanted, irrigated and weeded,... and rubber plantations were established.

The subtropical areas of Yunnan can indeed grow rubber, and the young rubber forests are growing well.

As the saying goes: the weather is unpredictable, and people have misfortunes at any time.

The rubber trees of Yunnan, like pampered young ladies, were playing in fertile and clean gardens when suddenly (who knows why!) an "emergency contraction" order came flying!

So, all the agricultural workers were laid off, all the production tools were transferred (or rather, thrown away)! All the cadres were transferred away – every last one of them, not even one was left behind.

So, I saw a "miracle": the young rubber forests that people had painstakingly cultivated were deserted...

This is not yet strange, the stranger thing is still behind.

A friend who has lived in Yunnan for a long time told me: "The rubber trees planted in the mountains were almost all burned by farmers setting fire to the mountains." I asked him why they burned them? He said, "The thatch grows too high, and cattle and horses can't eat it. It is necessary to burn the old grass to let the tender grass grow." "Then what about the rubber trees?" "The rubber trees also went back to their old home with the old grass!"

Good heavens! Now we are advocating planting trees and cultivating forests, but the rubber forests that have been planted have been burned down!

There is still stranger.

There is a youth reclamation team in the Nujiang Dam. It is said that one of their cultivated lands is a piece of land left over from a certain rubber plantation. Although rubber trees have not yet been cultivated there, all the preparations have been made, and of course it has long been deserted. After the youth reclamation team reclaimed the wasteland that was prepared for cultivating rubber trees into cotton fields, they suddenly discovered that rubber trees could be cultivated there, so in their planning they also planned to set aside that piece of land to cultivate rubber trees!

Good heavens! The rubber forests that have already been cultivated have not yet been completely destroyed, why are we cultivating new rubber forests! Why is this happening?

Facing such bizarre realities, I was dumbfounded – I couldn't figure out the mystery at all!

I even hate those two old rubber trees that were discovered. Without them, how could so many strange things have happened!

I think: those two old rubber trees never thought that they would bring so many disasters to their descendants! I appeal: save those remaining small rubber trees!

### 橡胶树的厄运

    橡胶树的厄运
    孙谦
    橡胶树是我国稀有的珍贵植物。在我的想像中，橡胶园的土地一定耕得非常松软，橡胶园里一定不会生长着杂草。但是，云南橡胶树的遭遇并非如此。
    不久以前，当我在云南芒市附近旅行的时候，同行者忽然告诉我说：“那就是橡胶树！”我顺着他手指的方向望去，只见满山满坡的荒草，并没有什么橡胶树。同行者跑进那二尺多高的草地里，用手抓住了一株比草稍许高一点的枯黄的小树说：“这就是橡胶树。”
    我在海南岛见过很多橡胶树。云南橡胶树的品种和海南岛的一样，但在这里我却不认识橡胶树了。
    我站在那荒芜的橡胶园的地头想着：为什么同样的橡胶树会有两种不同的命运？
    五年以前，在一位傣族土司的官邸附近，发现了两株生长状况良好的橡胶树，据说这位土司的父亲曾经培植过一个小的橡胶园。但是，在橡胶树刚长成的时候，日本军队闯进来了，日本人不能让傣族人经营橡胶，一声令下，日本军队就把所有的橡胶树砍光了。以后发现的那两株橡胶树，因为生长在其它树丛中，没有被日本军队发现，便侥幸地保存了下来。
    “云南发现了橡胶树！”
    于是，专家们来了。专家们围着那两株橡胶树转了几圈以后，立刻给橡胶树修盖围墙。于是，那两株橡胶树就像神像似地被供在围墙里了。
    “云南的亚热带地区很适合种植橡胶。”
    于是，要钱有钱，要人有人，立刻动员了一万多名干部去筹办橡胶园。
    于是，招雇了大批的农业工人，置办了大量的生产工具，挖坡开山，培种育苗，开园移苗，灌溉锄草，……橡胶园搞起来了。
    云南的亚热带地区确实可以种植橡胶，橡胶树的幼林，生长情况良好。
    俗话说：天有不测风云，人有旦夕祸福。
    云南的橡胶树正像娇生惯养的千金小姐似地在肥沃而洁净的园林里嬉耍，忽然间（鬼知道是什么原因！）飞来了一道“紧急收缩”的命令！
    于是，所有的农业工人被解雇了，所有的生产工具都被移交了（或者可以说是被扔掉了）！所有的干部都被调走了——走了个精光，连一个也没有留下。
    于是，我就看见了“奇迹”：人们费了千辛万苦培植出来的橡胶树幼林荒芜了……
    这还不奇，更奇的还在后面。
    有一位久住云南的朋友告诉我：“种植在大山里的橡胶树，几乎全被农民放火烧山烧掉了。”我问他为什么要烧？他说：“茅草长得太高了，牛马啃不下，需要把老草烧死，让嫩草长出来。”“那么橡胶树呢？”“橡胶树也跟上老草回老家去了！”
    老天爷！现在正提倡种树育林，而种出来的橡胶林却被烧掉了！
    还有奇的。
    怒江坝有个青年垦荒队。据说，在他们的耕地中有一块是某个橡胶园扔下来的土地。那里虽然还没有培植橡胶树，可是已经作好了一切准备工作，当然早已荒芜了。青年垦荒队把准备培植橡胶树的荒地开垦为棉田以后，忽然又发现了那里可以培植橡胶树，于是在他们的规划里又准备把那块土地划出来，专门培植橡胶树！
    老天爷！已经培植出来的橡胶林还没有摧残完毕，为什么又要培植新的橡胶林！这到底为什么？
    面对着这样千奇百怪的现实，我呆若木鸡——我连一点也摸不透其中的奥妙！
    我倒恨起那两株被发现的老橡胶树。没有他们，哪儿会有这么些古怪事情发生！
    我想：那两株老橡胶树决没有想到它们会给它们的后辈儿孙带来那么多的灾难！我呼吁：救救那些残留下来的小橡胶树吧！
