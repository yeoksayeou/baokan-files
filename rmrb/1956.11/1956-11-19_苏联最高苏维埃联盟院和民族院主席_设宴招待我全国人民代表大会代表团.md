Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 18th - Lobanov, Chairman of the Soviet Supreme Soviet of the Union, and Razakov, Chairman of the Soviet of Nationalities, hosted a banquet on the 17th in honor of the delegation of the National People's Congress of China, headed by Peng Zhen.

Liu Xiao, the Chinese Ambassador to the Soviet Union, was also invited to attend the banquet.

On the Soviet side, those present included Tarasov and Kozhitsa, Vice-Chairmen of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, Gorkin, Secretary, Kapitonov, member, as well as representatives of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, ministers of the Soviet government, and many well-known figures from society.

Razakov delivered a welcoming speech at the meeting. He said that the distinguished guests from People's China are close to the hearts of every Soviet person. We are happy and proud of the amazing achievements of the Chinese people. If China and the Soviet Union, two great nations united by brotherly friendship and common noble goals, stand shoulder to shoulder on the same front, they will form a huge and invincible force that no one can envy or hate.

Finally, Razakov raised his glass amidst applause to congratulate the eternal and unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples. At this moment, Lobanov, Chairman of the Soviet of the Union, shouted in Chinese: "Long live the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people!"

Peng Zhen then delivered a speech. He first expressed his gratitude to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union for the invitation and warm reception. It was precisely by following the correct path pointed out by the October Revolution, and after a long and arduous struggle, that the Chinese people achieved revolutionary victory and today's achievements. At the same time, the Chinese people express their deep gratitude to the Soviet Union for its tremendous assistance and support to China's socialist construction. Peng Zhen emphasized that the Chinese people firmly believe that continuing to consolidate and strengthen the unity among the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union is our highest international obligation and our greatest interest, and it is the unshakable foundation of our foreign policy. The unity among our socialist countries is not only necessary but also entirely possible, because the relations between our brotherly countries should not only be and can be handled entirely in accordance with the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, but also have the common belief in the great Marxism-Leninism, which is applicable to all seas, as a pointer. This is the foundation of the eternal and unbreakable unity between our brotherly countries. We believe that this fraternal unity and cooperation among socialist countries is the most reliable pillar for maintaining world peace and promoting the cause of human progress. The imperialists and all counter-revolutionaries understand this very profoundly. Therefore, they are always tirelessly trying every possible means to undermine our unity and attempt to subvert socialist countries by means of "defeating them one by one" and "capturing fortresses from within". The most typical example is the recent evil activities they carried out in the Hungarian incident, where they fantastically attempted to use the good wishes and demands of the Hungarian people to realize a counter-revolutionary restoration conspiracy. The imperialists are carrying out conspiracies and subversion in Hungary and open armed aggression in Egypt. They did not expect the Hungarian working class and working people to begin to see the conspiracies and true colors of the bandits, and the Hungarian Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government, with the assistance of the Soviet army, has crushed the imperialists' and various Hungarian reactionaries' wishful thinking and restoration activities. The Anglo-French aggression against Egypt is also in a desperate situation under the unanimous opposition of the world. Peng Zhen said that the Chinese people stand firmly with the Soviet people. We firmly believe that revolution will surely defeat counter-revolution, and peace will surely defeat war. Peng Zhen finally proposed a toast to the victory of the October Socialist Revolution, to the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and to the unbreakable and eternal friendship between China and the Soviet Union.

In the past two days, the delegation of the National People's Congress of China has been engaged in sightseeing activities in Moscow. On the 16th, the representatives visited the historical sites of the Kremlin and the Moscow Metro. In the afternoon of the 17th, they visited the Lenin Stalin Mausoleum and laid wreaths. On this day, the delegation also attended a banquet held by the Soviet Communist Party and state leaders to entertain the delegation of the Polish United Workers' Party and the Polish government, and in the evening watched a ballet at the Bolshoi Theatre.

    苏联最高苏维埃联盟院和民族院主席
    设宴招待我全国人民代表大会代表团
    新华社莫斯科18日电　苏联最高苏维埃联盟院主席洛巴诺夫、民族院主席拉齐斯17日设宴招待以彭真为首的中国全国人民代表大会代表团。
    中国驻苏联大使刘晓也应邀出席了宴会。
    苏联方面出席作陪的有苏联最高苏维埃主席团副主席塔拉索夫、科吉察，秘书戈尔金，委员卡皮托诺夫，以及苏联最高苏维埃代表、苏联政府的部长和社会知名人士等多人。
    拉齐斯在会上致欢迎词。他说，人民中国的贵宾在每个苏联人的心上都是亲近的。我们为中国人民的惊人成就而高兴，并以此而感到骄傲。如果中国和苏联这两个以兄弟友谊和共同的高尚目的团结在一起的伟大民族肩并肩地站在一条战线上，那就形成一支不怕任何人嫉妒和仇视的巨大的不可战胜的力量。
    最后，拉齐斯在掌声中举杯祝贺中苏两国人民永恒的、牢不可破的友谊。这时联盟院主席洛巴诺夫用中国话高呼：“中苏人民友好万岁！”
    彭真接着致词。他首先对苏联最高苏维埃的邀请和亲切的接待表示感谢。中国人民正是按照十月革命指出了的正确道路，经过长期的、残酷的斗争，才取得了革命胜利和今天的成就的。同时，中国人民对苏联对中国的社会主义建设所给予的巨大援助和支持表示深切的感谢。彭真强调说，中国人民坚定地认为，继续巩固和加强以苏联为首的社会主义各国间的团结，是我们最高的国际义务，也是我们的最大利益，它是我国对外政策的不可动摇的基础。我们社会主义各国间的团结，不但是必要的，而且是完全可能的，因为我们兄弟各国之间的关系，不但完全应该和能够按照和平共处的五项原则处理，而且有着放之四海而皆准的伟大的马克思列宁主义的共同信仰作指针，这是我们兄弟各国间永恒的牢不可破的团结的基础。我们认为社会主义各国间这种兄弟般的团结和合作是维护世界和平和促进人类进步事业的最可靠的支柱。帝国主义者和一切反革命分子是十分深刻地了解这一点的。因此，他们总是毫不停歇地千方百计地破坏我们的团结，并且企图用“各个击破”和“从内部夺取堡垒”的办法颠覆各个社会主义国家。最典型的例子，就是他们最近在匈牙利事件中进行的罪恶活动，他们竟妙想天开地企图利用匈牙利人民的善良愿望和要求实现反革命复辟的阴谋。帝国主义者在匈牙利是进行阴谋颠覆活动，在埃及是进行公开的武装侵略。他们没有料到匈牙利的工人阶级和劳动人民开始看清强盗们的阴谋和原形了，匈牙利的工农革命政府在苏联军队的协助下，已经把帝国主义者和匈牙利各种反动分子的如意算盘和复辟活动粉碎了。英法对埃及的侵略，也在举世一致的反对下，陷于困兽般的境地了。彭真说，中国人民坚定地和苏联人民站在一起。我们坚信革命必将战胜反革命，和平必将战胜战争。彭真最后建议，为十月社会主义革命道路的胜利，为以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结，为中苏两国牢不可破的永恒友谊干杯。
    中国全国人民代表大会代表团最近两天在莫斯科进行了参观活动。代表们16日参观了克里姆林宫的古迹和莫斯科地下铁道。17日下午参谒了列宁斯大林陵墓并献了花圈。这一天，代表团还参加了苏联共产党和国家领导人为招待波兰统一工人党和波兰政府代表团举行的宴会，晚间在大剧院观看了巴蕾舞剧。
