　　Lying on the stretcher, Liu Yuanlin thought about many things along the way. He recalled his mother's earnest instructions when he joined the army in 1947, and how he only served in the revolutionary forces for two years before being injured and returning home. What should he say to his mother when he got home? His home was in Luogezhuang, Fushan County, Shandong Province.

　　Upon entering the village, people recognized that it was Liu Yuanlin returning, and knowing that he was blind, they all crowded around, calling out his name. The children on the street ran ahead to tell Yuanlin's mother. As soon as he entered the courtyard, his mother grabbed his hand and cried, "Yuanlin, you can't see me anymore!"

　　"No, Mom, I can still see a little, it's just not very clear..." This was the first time he had lied to his mother.

　　That night, holding his mother's hand, he recounted the details of his injury...

　　In February 1948, during a blocking action near Zhoucun, Shandong, a shell exploded in front of him, and heavy mud buried him in the trench... When he woke up, he couldn't see anything. The medic told him that he had been lying in the hospital for seven days without waking up. He was seriously injured, and his eyes could no longer see.

　　It was over. He was blind, only nineteen years old. Was this how his life was going to end?

　　From the hospital to the Veterans' School, he initially just hung his head low, unable to hear the organization's comfort and education. He didn't know how to arrange the long years ahead. One day, the instructor told him the story of Pavel Korchagin. For the first time, he raised his head. Although he didn't understand some of the details, the name strongly attracted him and gave him an immeasurable amount of strength to live on. Finally, he insisted on returning home to work for the Party.

　　His mother listened excitedly to her son's narration, then told him about the family's liberation and led him to feel the grain they had been allocated. The son also took the opportunity to persuade his mother not to cry anymore, lest people laugh at her.

　　He decided that he must not become a burden on his family after returning. He began practicing going out on his own. He often bumped into walls or fell on the street. The playful children would shout, "Blind man, blind man!" His face would flush with heat, and he felt very sad. At this time, someone would often come over to gently pull him or tell him which way to go. He could tell from the voice that it was a young woman, but he didn't know her.

　　In order to carry out his work, he found an enthusiastic teacher at the people's school and asked him to read the newspaper to him every day. It was the time of national liberation, and he spread these inspiring news on the street. People said that Yuanlin was blind, but he knew more than those of us with eyes.

　　With the support of the masses, he further participated in various tasks. People reported to him more than once that the village's deputy secretary of the Party branch was a running dog who had infiltrated the Party to serve the landlords and rich peasants. At first, he struggled within the Party branch, and finally reported it to the district committee. After this secretary was dealt with in 1951, Liu Yuanlin was elected secretary of the Party branch.

　　One snowy night, Liu Yuanlin went to the people's school to teach a political class. Only less than half of the seventy-plus students had arrived. He was a little worried, so he decided to go and call on them himself. The snow on the street hadn't been cleared yet, and the road was difficult to walk. Unexpectedly, a girl caught up from behind. She whispered, "Brother Yuanlin, the road is hard to walk, let me go with you!" Liu Yuanlin recognized the familiar voice as the girl who often guided him. That day, he learned that the girl's name was Liu Shufeng, and she lived in the east end of the village.

　　One spring evening, Liu Yuanlin and Liu Shufeng met in the courtyard of the village office. The courtyard was quiet. That day, Liu Shufeng seemed particularly excited. She said many things about how the masses praised Liu Yuanlin. Finally, she suddenly asked, "Brother Yuanlin, don't you want to find a partner?"

　　This question was really unexpected for Liu Yuanlin. To be honest, since he went blind, he had never thought about it again. What should he answer now? He could hear Liu Shufeng breathing rapidly. He thought for a while and replied:

　　"Who would want to be with a blind man!"

　　"Not necessarily, someone really wants to establish a relationship with you..." Her voice became softer and softer, but she finally boldly revealed her love for him...

　　After this, Liu Yuanlin didn't see Liu Shufeng for more than half a month. Perhaps the girl was shy, because the matchmaker had already been to her house. When she heard the definite news, she ran to the street regardless and found Liu Yuanlin. She only said one sentence upon meeting, "My mom agreed!" and then ran away.

　　On the wedding night, the two talked all night long. Liu Yuanlin touched Liu Shufeng's short hair and cheeks, and he seemed to see her beautiful face. He said to her, "Living with a blind man, do you know how much trouble it is? Even the shoes I take off every day have to be handed to me by you!" Shufeng replied, "I had thought about these things a long time ago. Two years ago, when I first saw you, you were lying on a stretcher, and I felt so sorry for you. But later, I saw you working for everyone, and the more I saw you, the more I felt that you had a good heart. I no longer felt sorry for you, I just felt that you needed someone to take care of you..."

　　Hearing this, Liu Yuanlin couldn't help but hug Shufeng even tighter.

　　In October 1956, the night before Liu Yuanlin came to Beijing to participate in the congress of activists of revolutionary martyrs' families, military families, disabled soldiers, and demobilized soldiers, the couple didn't sleep all night again. Liu Yuanlin was the director of the agricultural cooperative, and he talked about the work in the cooperative. Liu Shufeng stroked her three children sleeping beside her, while stubbornly insisting that she must take her husband to the county seat tomorrow.

　　The next morning, the sound of gongs and drums reverberated throughout the village. People put red flowers on Yuanlin's chest and sent him to the village entrance. Liu Shufeng stayed close by his side all the way. (Attached picture)

    刘元林和他的妻子
    江车
    躺在担架里，一路上刘元林想的很多，他想起了1947年参军时母亲殷切的嘱咐，想到自己在革命部队只干了两年就受伤回来，到了家该跟妈妈说些什么好呢？他的家在山东省福山县罗格庄。
    进了村，人们发现是刘元林回来，并且知道他眼瞎了，就都拥上来，一边喊着他的名字，街上的孩子们却先跑去告诉了元林的妈妈。一进院子，妈妈拉住他的手就哭了出来，“元林，你看不见我了！”
      “不，妈妈，我还能看见点，就是不太清楚……”这是他第一次跟妈妈说了谎。
    晚上，握着妈妈的手，讲着受伤的经过……。
    1948年2月，在山东周村附近的一次阻击战中，一颗炮弹在他头前爆炸了，沉重的泥土把他埋在壕沟里……。醒来，什么也看不见，卫生员告诉他已经躺在病院里有七天没有醒来。他受的伤很重，眼睛再也不能看到什么了。
    完了，眼瞎了，才只有十九岁，难道这一辈子就这样完了吗？
    从医院到荣军学校去，起初他对组织的安慰、教育，只是低着头，什么也听不进去，他不知该怎么安排以后的漫长的岁月。有一天，教导员给他讲了保尔·柯察金的故事，他第一次抬起头来，虽然有些情节他还弄不清楚，但这个名字强烈的吸引了他，给了他生活下去以难以估计的力量。最后，他坚决要回到家去为党工作。
    妈妈激动地听完儿子的叙述，接着就给儿子讲起家里翻身的经过，又领着儿子摸摸分得的粮食，儿子也趁机劝妈妈不要再哭了，免得让人见了笑话。
    回来了决不能给家里添个拖累，他就开始练习着自己出门，走在街上常常碰到墙上或摔倒了，嬉闹的孩子们就喊着：“瞎子，瞎子！”他听了脸上一阵发热，心里也十分难过，这时候常常有个人过来轻轻地拉他一下，或是告诉他该向那边走，从声音里可以听出这是个年青的姑娘，但，他并不认识她。
    为了开展工作，他在民校找到一位热心的教员，请他每天给自己读报，那时正是全国解放的时候，他就把这些振奋人心的消息在街上传播，人们都说，元林眼瞎，可比我们睁眼的人知道的事还多。
    有了群众的支持，他就进一步地参加各项工作，人们不止一次地向他反映村副支书是个钻入党内给地主富农办事的狗腿子，起初他在党支部进行斗争，最后又检举到区委，1951年处理了这个支书以后，刘元林就当选了支部书记。
    大雪后的一个夜晚，刘元林到民校去教政治课，七十多个学员中才来了不到一半，他真有点着急，就决定自己去叫。这时街上的积雪还没扫过，路很难走。没想到后面赶来一个姑娘，她轻声地喊着：“元林大哥，路不好走，我跟你一块儿去吧！”刘元林听了这个熟悉的声音知道正是常给自己引路的那位姑娘，这一天，他知道了姑娘的名字叫柳树凤，家就住在村东头。
    是个春天的傍晚，刘元林和柳树凤在村公所院子里碰到了，院里静悄悄的。那一天，柳树凤显得特别激动，她说了许多群众怎样称道刘元林的话，最后她突然问道：“元林大哥，你不想找个对象吗？”
    这问题对刘元林来说实在意外，说真的，自从眼瞎了以后，他从未再想过这件事，现在该怎么回答呢？他听得出柳树凤急促地喘着气。他想了想回答道：
    “一个瞎子，谁还愿意跟咱哪！”
    “不一定吧，有个人很想和你建立个关系呢……”她的声音越来越轻微了，但她终于大胆地吐露了对他的爱情……。
    这以后，刘元林有半个多月没碰到过柳树凤，也许是姑娘怕羞了，因为媒人已到她家来过。当她听到肯定的消息以后，她不顾一切地跑到街上找到了刘元林，见面只说了一句“俺娘答应了！”就跑远了。
    结婚那天夜里，两个人说了一宿的话，刘元林摸着柳树凤的短发和脸颊，他仿佛看到了她那张美丽的脸。他对她说：“跟一个瞎子在一起生活，你知道多么麻烦吗？就连每天脱下来的鞋都要你递给我呢！”树凤回答：“这些我早就想过了。两年前，我第一次看到你时，你躺在担架里，我觉得你真可怜，可是往后我看到你给大家办事，越看越觉得你心眼好，再也不觉得你可怜了，只觉得你需要有人照顾……。”
    刘元林听了，不由得将树凤更紧地拥在怀里。
    1956年10月，刘元林来北京参加烈属、军属、残废军人、复员军人积极分子大会的头一天晚上，夫妻俩又一夜没睡，刘元林是农业社的社长，他数叨着社里的工作；柳树凤抚摸着睡在一旁的自己的三个孩子，一边执拗地表示明天一定要把丈夫送到县里。
    第二天清早，锣鼓声响遍了全村，人们给元林胸前戴上了红花，把他送到村头，柳树凤一路紧紧地挨在他身边。（附图片）
