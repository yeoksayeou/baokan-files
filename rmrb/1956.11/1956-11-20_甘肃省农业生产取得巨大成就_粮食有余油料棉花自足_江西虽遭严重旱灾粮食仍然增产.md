Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 19th. Gansu Province has for the first time this year become a province that is self-sufficient and has a surplus in grain, cotton, and oilseeds.

Gansu Province began shipping surplus grain out in 1954. This year, large quantities of grain are being transported to Hebei, Shanxi, and other provinces, as well as to Tibet, Qinghai, Inner Mongolia, and other minority areas.

In the past, Gansu Province relied on imports from other provinces for cotton and oilseeds, but this year it has become self-sufficient. According to estimates from relevant departments, this year's cotton production could reach more than 350,000 dan (lint); the oilseed crop harvest is also good. The state-owned oil department is planning to transfer 18,000 tons to supply the needs of people in other provinces.

The main reasons why Gansu Province has been able to rapidly achieve self-sufficiency and a surplus in grain, cotton, and oilseeds are: rapid increase in the yield per unit area of ​​crops, reclamation of wasteland, and increased cultivated area. Between 1952 and 1956, the yield of grain crops per mu in Gansu Province was 116.6 jin, and this year it has reached 188.4 jin. During the same period, the cultivated area also increased by 64.3%.

Gansu Province, based on the fact that 78% of its cultivated land is dry land and rainfall is generally scarce, has built various types of water conservancy projects in accordance with local conditions. This has brought the province's irrigated area to more than 13 million mu.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 18th. Many areas of Jiangxi Province suffered severe drought this year, but the province's total grain output is still estimated to increase compared to last year's bumper harvest.

Jiangxi Province continued to promote the "three transformations" measures in agriculture this year, which is to change single-season rice into double-season rice (including changing mid-season rice to early rice and then planting another season), dry land into paddy fields, and wasteland into cultivated land. This year, the province's early rice planting area reached more than 18 million mu, an increase of more than 2 million mu compared to last year. This year, the total output of early rice alone increased by 1.4 billion jin compared to last year. After the early rice harvest, it did not rain for more than 60 days in many areas, and the drought-stricken and water-deficient fields accounted for about a quarter of the province's total field area. Party and government organs at all levels led agricultural production cooperatives to resolutely fight the drought, reducing the losses of mid-season rice, late-season rice, and other autumn crops. Except for the western Ji'an area, which was the hardest hit by the disaster, the total annual grain output of all other areas and the Gannan Administrative Region increased compared to last year. The Jiujiang area, which was less affected by the drought, increased its total grain output by more than 20% compared to last year, thereby changing from a grain-deficient area to a surplus grain area.

### 甘肃省农业生产取得巨大成就  粮食有余油料棉花自足  江西虽遭严重旱灾粮食仍然增产

    甘肃省农业生产取得巨大成就
    粮食有余油料棉花自足
    江西虽遭严重旱灾粮食仍然增产
    据新华社兰州19日电　甘肃省今年第一次成为粮食、棉花和油料自给自足而且有余的省份。
    甘肃省余粮外运是从1954年开始的。今年有大批粮食运往河北、山西等省和西藏、青海、内蒙古等少数民族地区。
    甘肃省的棉花和油料过去依靠外省输入，今年开始自给自足。据有关部门的估计，今年棉花产量可达三十五万多担（皮棉）；油料作物收成也很好，国营油脂部门正计划外调一万八千吨，供应其他省人民的需要。
    甘肃省的粮食、棉花和油料能够迅速达到自给自足而且有余，主要原因是：迅速提高了农作物的单位面积产量，开垦了荒地，增加了耕地面积。1952年到1956年间，甘肃省粮食作物每亩产一百十六点六斤，今年已经达到一百八十八点四斤。同时期，耕地面积也增加了64.3％。
    甘肃省根据78％的耕地是旱地、雨量普遍稀少的情况，因地制宜地兴建了各种类型的水利工程。使全省农田灌溉面积达到一千三百多万亩。
    据新华社南昌18日电　江西省很多地区今年遭到严重旱灾，但是全省粮食总产量估计仍然比去年丰收年景增加。
    江西省今年继续推行了农业“三变”措施，就是把单季稻变为双季稻（包括中稻变早稻后再种一季），旱地变水田，荒地变熟地。今年全省早稻的播种面积达一千八百多万亩，比去年增加二百多万亩。今年只早稻一项，总产量就比去年增加了十四亿斤。早稻收割后，很多地区有六十多天没有下雨，受旱缺水的田亩约占全省总田亩数四分之一。各地党、政机关领导农业生产合作社坚决地同旱灾作斗争，减轻了中稻、晚稻和其他秋作物的损失。全省除了受灾最重的西部吉安专区以外，其余各专区和赣南行政区全年粮食总产量都比去年增加。受旱较轻的九江专区，粮食总产量比去年增加20％以上，从而由缺粮地区变成为余粮地区。
