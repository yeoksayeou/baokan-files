    A Solemn Statement
    The 16th Olympic Games will soon open in Melbourne. The Chinese Olympic Committee has selected a large team from national competitions, preparing to participate in the games and promote friendship with athletes from various countries. However, the International Olympic Committee and the Organizing Committee of the 16th Olympic Games, disregarding repeated protests from our Olympic Committee, stubbornly refuse to correct their errors. They still recognize the so-called "two Chinese Olympic Committees," accept Taiwan's separate dispatch of athletes to participate in the games, and raise the flag of the Taiwan Kuomintang clique, which has long been spurned by the Chinese people. This is a serious insult to the Chinese people and Chinese athletes. The Chinese people cannot but express immense indignation and severe protest against this. The Chinese Olympic Committee has issued a statement indicating that Chinese athletes cannot participate in the 16th Olympic Games until this situation is changed, and this solemn stance is entirely correct.
    The International Olympic Committee insists on its erroneous practices and cannot provide any justifiable reasons, because such reasons simply do not exist. The International Olympic Committee recognized the All-China Sports Federation as the Chinese Olympic Committee, and in the previous Olympic Games, in fact, only the All-China Sports Federation sent a team to participate, which was completely normal. Because the All-China Sports Federation is China's only legitimate national sports organization, but when China selected a larger number of athletes to participate in the 16th Olympic Games, the International Olympic Committee recognized the so-called "two Chinese Olympic Committees" and even accepted the non-existent so-called "Formosa China" team. The Organizing Committee of the 16th Olympic Games even unreasonably lowered the national flag of the People's Republic of China and absurdly raised the flag of the Taiwan Kuomintang clique, which has long been spurned by the Chinese people. This can only be seen as a deliberate insult to the Chinese people and Chinese athletes, preventing the Chinese Olympic Committee team from participating in the games. The actions of the International Olympic Committee and the Organizing Committee of the 16th Olympic Games completely violate the Olympic Charter's principle of recognizing only one Olympic Committee and only one representative team from a country to participate in the games.
    Moreover, Taiwan is a province of China, and Taiwan's sports organizations should belong to the Chinese Olympic Committee. Therefore, it was perfectly justifiable for the Chinese Olympic Committee to notify Taiwanese athletes to participate in the selection trials. However, the International Olympic Committee actually accepted the so-called protest from the Taiwan Kuomintang clique and decided to discuss it illegally at the 52nd International Olympic Committee meeting to be held on November 19th. Particularly infuriating is that the International Olympic Committee's Executive Committee dared to arbitrarily rename the People's Republic of China as "Beijing China" and call Taiwan "Formosa China." These extremely absurd measures more clearly expose their determination to undermine the Olympic Games' tradition of not being abused for political purposes, turning this international sports organization into a tool for manipulating the "two Chinas" international political conspiracy. This is absolutely intolerable to the Chinese people and Chinese athletes.
    The International Olympic Committee and the Organizing Committee of the 16th Olympic Games, disregarding their own charter and reputation, painstakingly play many absurd and clumsy tricks, involving themselves in the political conspiracy of creating "two Chinas," which is extremely astonishing. Currently, the US policy of occupying our Taiwan and depriving our legitimate status in international affairs is increasingly unpopular, and the political conspiracy of creating "two Chinas" is also increasingly reaching its wit's end. If the International Olympic Committee wants to bear an inglorious mission in this regard, it will inevitably find itself in a contradictory and embarrassing situation. In order to maintain the Olympic Charter and reputation, the International Olympic Committee and the Organizing Committee of the 16th Olympic Games should immediately extricate themselves from this political conspiracy that will not have any hope.
    The Chinese people and Chinese athletes will never tolerate the International Olympic Committee's conspiracy to split China, and demand that the International Olympic Committee should only recognize the All-China Sports Federation and revoke Taiwan's right to send athletes to participate in the games. This solemn and reasonable demand cannot be ignored.

### 严正的声明

    严正的声明
    第十六届奥林匹克运动会即将在墨尔本开幕。中国奥林匹克委员会已从全国选拔赛中选出了规模很大的运动队，准备前往参加竞赛，促进同各国运动员之间的友谊。但是，国际奥林匹克委员会和第十六届奥林匹克运动会组织委员会毫不顾我国奥林匹克委员会的一再抗议，坚不改正错误，仍然承认所谓“两个中国奥林匹克委员会”，接受台湾单独派出运动员参加竞赛，并升起了早已为中国人民所唾弃的台湾国民党集团的旗帜，这是对中国人民和中国运动员的严重侮辱。中国人民对此不能不表示无比愤慨和严重抗议。中国奥林匹克委员会发表声明，表示在这个情况未改变前，中国的运动员不能参加第十六届奥林匹克运动会，这个严正立场，是完全正确的。
    国际奥林匹克委员会坚持它的错误做法，提不出任何站得住脚的理由来，因为这样的理由是根本不存在的。国际奥林匹克委员会承认了中华全国体育总会为中国奥林匹克委员会，上届奥林匹克运动会实际上也只有中华全国体育总会派队参加，这是完全正常的。因为中华全国体育总会是中国唯一合法的全国体育组织，但是当中国选拔了更大数量的运动队参加第十六届奥林匹克运动会的时候，国际奥林匹克委员会却承认所谓“两个中国奥林匹克委员会”，还接受根本不存在的所谓“福摩萨中国”的运动队。第十六届奥林匹克运动会组织委员会甚至无理降下中华人民共和国的国旗，荒谬地升起了早已为中国人民所唾弃的台湾国民党集团的旗帜，这只能被认为是蓄意侮辱中国人民和中国运动员，使中国奥林匹克委员会运动队不能参加竞赛。国际奥林匹克委员会和第十六届奥林匹克运动会组织委员会的这种行径，完全违反了奥林匹克运动会宪章关于在一个国家只应承认一个奥林匹克委员会和只应有一个代表队参加运动会的原则。
    不仅如此，台湾是中国的一个省，台湾的运动组织应该属于中国奥林匹克委员会，因而中国奥林匹克委员会通知台湾运动员参加选拔赛，原是天经地义的事，但是国际奥林匹克委员会竟接受台湾国民党集团的所谓抗议，并决定将在11月19日举行的第五十二届国际奥林匹克委员会会议上加以非法讨论。特别令人感到愤慨的是，国际奥委会执委会竟敢擅自把中华人民共和国改称“北京中国”，而叫台湾为“福摩萨中国”。这种荒唐已极的措施，更加明显地暴露了他们决心破坏奥林匹克运动会不得滥用于政治目的的传统，使这个国际体育组织成为玩弄“两个中国”的国际政治阴谋的一个工具。这是中国人民和中国运动员绝对不能容忍的。
    国际奥林匹克委员会和第十六届奥林匹克运动会组织委员会不顾自己的宪章和信誉，煞费苦心地玩弄许多荒唐的拙劣花样，使自己卷进制造“两个中国”的政治阴谋中去，这是十分令人惊异的。目前美国霸占我国台湾，剥夺我国在国际事务中的合法地位的政策日益不得人心，制造“两个中国”的政治阴谋也日益感到黔驴技穷。国际奥林匹克委员会要在这方面负担一个不名誉的使命，就不可避免地要使自己陷于矛盾百出和狼狈不堪的境地。为了维护奥林匹克运动会的宪章和信誉，国际奥林匹克委员会和第十六届奥林匹克运动会组织委员会，应该立即从这种决不会有什么希望的政治阴谋中解脱出来。
    中国人民和中国运动员决不能容忍国际奥林匹克委员会进行的分裂中国的阴谋，并要求国际奥林匹克委员会应只承认中华全国体育总会，取消台湾派运动员参加竞赛的权利。这个严正的、合理的要求是不容漠视的。
