    The Highest International Obligation
    Qian Junrui, Secretary-General of the Council of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association

    In this great and momentous era, there is no more lofty and urgent task than to further strengthen and consolidate the friendly cooperation between socialist countries, especially to strengthen and consolidate the friendly cooperation between China and the Soviet Union.

    The cause of the people of all socialist countries building a free and beautiful new life, the cause of independence and liberation of all weak nations, the progressive cause of all mankind, and the sacred cause of maintaining world peace all rely on the friendly unity among these socialist countries. It is no exaggeration to say that this is the lifeline of all mankind in the 1950s. Anyone who wavers in the slightest on this point betrays the fundamental interests of the people of all countries and the fundamental interests of all mankind.

    Precisely for this reason, we wholeheartedly support the "Declaration on the Basis for the Development and Further Strengthening of Friendship and Cooperation between the Soviet Union and Other Socialist Countries" issued by the Soviet government on October 30. This great declaration, with an attitude responsible to the fate of all mankind and a spirit of self-criticism, solemnly pointed out the mistakes in the relations between socialist countries and proposed principles and major measures for continuing to strengthen friendly cooperation between the Soviet Union and other socialist countries in the future. It fully embodies the strong vitality of the socialist system and the socialist world system, and was immediately enthusiastically supported by all socialist countries. There is no doubt that it will have an extremely significant effect on strengthening the fraternal unity and mutual assistance of socialist countries, and on consolidating the great cause of peace and socialism.

    We warmly hail the new victory of the Polish people. Under the leadership of the Polish United Workers' Party headed by Comrade Gomulka, they are enthusiastically and in an orderly and step-by-step manner correcting the mistakes of the past leadership, adhering to socialism, adhering to Polish-Soviet friendship, and adhering to the unity of the socialist camp.

    In the past few days, we have painfully condemned the shameful betrayal of the Hungarian Nagy government, condemning it for openly violating the will of the Hungarian people, betraying socialism, abandoning Hungarian-Soviet friendship, abandoning the Warsaw Pact, and abandoning the socialist camp. We are also particularly delighted to celebrate the great victory of the Hungarian people, celebrating their escape from the deception of the traitors, wiping away the blood on their bodies, crushing the counter-revolutionary restoration plot with the help of the great Soviet army, restoring independence and freedom, and returning to the socialist track, adhering to Hungarian-Soviet friendship, and adhering to the great unity of the socialist camp.

    Today, anyone with eyes and conscience can understand that supporting or opposing the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, supporting or opposing friendly unity with the great Soviet Union, is the most important sign of testing the political attitude of all political groups and all individuals.

    Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people have unswervingly taken the consolidation and development of Sino-Soviet friendship and the consolidation and development of the unity and cooperation of the socialist camp as our highest international obligation.

    In fact, the fraternal friendship between the Chinese people and the great Soviet people is solid and unbreakable. Our unity with all fraternal countries is also extremely strong. They have undergone many severe tests. Even the imperialists can no longer deny this.

    However, we have no reason to relax or become complacent in this most lofty cause.

      The reactionaries of the whole world are now most afraid of the Soviet Union, and most afraid of the unity of China and the Soviet Union. They are looking for gaps every moment, trying to provoke our unity. We must maintain a high degree of vigilance at all times.

      The idea of bourgeois nationalism—the idea of great-power chauvinism—can find fertile ground in socialist great powers, such as our China. The revolution has been successful, construction is proceeding victoriously, and international prestige is rising. All these can become good nourishment for great-power chauvinism. We must guard against the invasion of this poisonous germ.

    The self-criticism made by the parties and governments of fraternal countries is their most responsible and serious manifestation to the people, and a major contribution to the people of their own countries and the working people of the world, which deserves our greater admiration and humble and earnest learning. If, on the contrary, it increases our own arrogance, it is not only completely wrong, but also very base and very dangerous.

    One of the important reasons for the victory of our party and our people is that we have been able to creatively learn and apply the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. But we also have had the experience of failure, and have suffered greatly from dogmatism. Therefore, on the issue of learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, if we learn successfully, we must thank the Soviet teachers for their sincere help; if we do not learn well, the responsibility lies entirely with ourselves. When learning from the experience of others, we must first distinguish which experiences are correct and truly advanced, and which experiences are incorrect. Even for correct and advanced experiences, we must combine them with our country's reality, and adapt them to local conditions, time, and circumstances, and apply them creatively, and must not mechanically copy them. If our learning adopts a dogmatic method, thus causing losses to our work, then we should only blame ourselves, correct our own wrong learning methods, and have no reason to blame others. We must learn from the Soviet Union more seriously and correctly.

    Do not think that the internationalist education work on Sino-Soviet friendship done among the broad masses of our people is enough. It is not. Temporary fluctuations in the masses' thinking cannot but attract our sufficient attention. We must also carry out extensive and in-depth education on promoting Sino-Soviet friendship and strengthening the unity of the socialist camp among the broad masses in connection with every major international event. Any underestimation and relaxation of this work is wrong. In this regard, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association should especially continue to work hard to do this work well, so that the broad masses of our people can more consciously fulfill their highest international obligations and make greater contributions to the great cause of world peace, democracy, and socialism.

    最高的国际义务
    中苏友好协会总会理事会秘书长　钱俊瑞
    在这伟大而又惊心动魄的时代，再没有比进一步加强和巩固社会主义国家之间的友好合作，首先是加强和巩固中苏两国的友好合作，更加崇高和更加紧要的任务了。
    各个社会主义国家的人民建设自由、美好的新生活的事业，各个弱小民族的独立和解放的事业，整个人类的进步事业和维护世界和平的神圣事业，都指靠着这个社会主义国家之间的友好团结。毫不夸大地说，这是二十世纪五十年代全人类的命根子。谁要在这一点上有丝毫的动摇，谁就背叛了各国人民本身的根本利益，背叛了全人类的根本利益。
    正是为了这，我们衷心地支持苏联政府在10月30日发表的“关于发展和进一步加强苏联同其他社会主义国家的友谊和合作的基础的宣言”。这一个伟大的宣言，用了对全人类命运负责的态度和自我批评的精神，严肃地指出社会主义国家之间的关系方面的错误，提出今后继续加强苏联同其他社会主义国家的友好合作的原则和重大措施。它充分地体现了社会主义制度和社会主义世界体系的强大的生命力，并且立即得到了所有社会主义国家的热烈赞助。毫无疑问，它对加强社会主义国家的兄弟团结和互助，对于巩固和平和社会主义的伟大事业，必然会产生极其重大的作用。
    我们热烈地欢呼波兰人民的新胜利。他们在以哥穆尔卡同志为首的波兰统一工人党的领导下，热情充沛地和有秩序有步骤地，纠正过去领导方面的错误，坚持社会主义，坚持波苏友好，坚持社会主义阵营的团结。
    这几天来我们曾经痛心疾首地谴责匈牙利纳吉政府的无耻叛变，谴责它公然违反匈牙利人民的意志，背叛社会主义，背弃匈苏友好，背弃华沙条约，背弃社会主义阵营。我们又特别兴高采烈地庆祝匈牙利人民的伟大胜利，庆祝他们摆脱叛徒们的骗局，抹干身上的鲜血，在伟大的苏联军队的帮助下，粉碎了反革命的复辟阴谋，恢复独立和自由，并且回到社会主义的轨道上来，坚持匈苏友谊，坚持社会主义阵营的伟大团结。
    今天凡是有眼睛有良知的人，都能了解：赞成或者反对以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结，赞成或者反对同伟大苏联的友好团结，乃是测验一切政治团体和一切个人的政治态度的最重要的标志。
    中国人民在中国共产党的领导下始终不渝地以巩固和发展中苏友谊，巩固和发展社会主义阵营的团结合作为我们最高的国际义务。
    事实上，中国人民和伟大的苏联人民之间的兄弟友谊是巩固的，是牢不可破的。我们和所有兄弟国家的团结也是极其坚实的。它们已经经历了许多严重的考验。这是连帝国主义者也已经不能否认的了。
    但是，我们在这一最崇高的事业中却完全没有丝毫松懈和麻痹的理由。
      全世界的反动派现在最怕的是苏联，最怕的是中国和苏联的团结。他们每时每刻都在那里寻找缝子，企图挑拨我们的团结。我们必须随时保持高度的警惕。
      资产阶级民族主义的思想——大国沙文主义的思想，可以在社会主义的大国，比如在我们中国，找到肥沃的土壤。革命成功了，建设在胜利地进行，国际威望在提高。所有这些，对于大国沙文主义都可以成为很好的养料。我们必须谨防这个毒菌的侵袭。
    兄弟国家的党和政府所作的自我批评，乃是它们对人民最负责和最严肃的表现，是对它们本国人民和全世界劳动人民的重大贡献，正值得我们更加敬佩，和虚心地认真地学习。假如因此反而增长了我们自己的骄气，那不仅是完全错误，而且十分卑鄙，十分危险。
    我们的党和我国人民取得胜利的重要原因之一，就是因为我们能够创造性地学习和运用苏联的先进经验。但是我们也有过失败的经验，曾经吃过教条主义的大亏。因此，在学习苏联先进经验的问题上，如果学得成功，我们必须感谢苏联老师们的真诚帮助，如果学得不好，那责任完全在我们自己。学习别人的经验，首先必须辨别那些经验是正确的，真正先进的，那些经验则是不正确的。即使对于正确的和先进的经验，我们也必须结合我国的实际，因地因时因事制宜，创造性地加以运用，决不可机械地搬用。如果我们的学习采取了教条主义的方法，因而使自己的工作遭受损失，那就只应该责备自己，纠正自己的错误的学习方法，而决没有任何理由责怪别人。我们必须更加认真和正确地学习苏联。
    也不要认为在我国广大人民群众中所作的关于中苏友好的国际主义教育工作已经很够了。不是的。群众思想一时的波动不能不引起我们足够的注意。我们还必须联系国际间每一个重大的事变，在广大群众中进行广泛和深入的关于增进中苏友好、加强社会主义阵营团结的教育。对于这一项工作的任何轻视和放松都是不对的。在这方面，中苏友好协会特别应该继续努力作好这项工作，使我国广大人民群众更加自觉地履行自己的最高国际义务，对世界和平、民主和社会主义的伟大事业作出更加重大的贡献。
