Xinhua News Agency, 24th: According to TASS, the Chairman of the Finnish Communist Party, Aimo Aaltonen, published an article in the Helsinki "People's Daily" on the 23rd, calling on the Finnish working people to be vigilant against the anti-Soviet conspiracies of the Finnish reactionary groups, and to strengthen unity to smash the reactionary plans that violate the vital interests and democratic rights of the working people.

Aaltonen wrote: Big capitalists and their representatives are trying to use certain international events to split the ranks of the working class and undermine the fighting power of the working class. The task of the party is to remind the working people to be vigilant against this danger and strive to strengthen the unity of the working people.

Aaltonen pointed out that the anti-Soviet instigation of the reactionary groups is an attack on the peaceful foreign policy, which is supported by the majority of the Finnish people.
