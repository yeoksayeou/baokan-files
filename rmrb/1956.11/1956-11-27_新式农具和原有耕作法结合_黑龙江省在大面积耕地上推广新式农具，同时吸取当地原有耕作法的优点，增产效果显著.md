Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 26th -- Heilongjiang Province, in promoting new animal-drawn farm tools this year, paid attention to absorbing the advantages of local existing farming methods, resulting in an average increase of about 20% in unit area yield of over 600,000 hectares of autumn crops.

The 230,000 hectares of millet and sorghum sown using new animal-drawn farm tools throughout the province were sown on the original ridges without plowing. Not plowing before sowing is a method traditionally used by farmers in Northeast China with old farm tools, and its advantage is that it can reduce the destruction of soil aggregate structure and maintain soil fertility. This year, millet and sorghum using this farming method generally increased production, especially in areas with severe spring drought, where production increased by about 50%.

The 210,000 hectares of soybeans and corn sown using new farm tools throughout the province were also plowed in early spring when the soil temperature rose, according to existing experience, and then quickly sown. As a result, the increase in production was also very good.

When sowing with new animal-drawn farm tools this year, the method of ridging while sowing or ridging after sowing was also adopted, changing the past practice of universal flat sowing. The production increase effect of ridging exceeded that of flat sowing, because ridging can expand the contact surface between the land and sunlight and air, reduce the topsoil being blown away by wind, and is conducive to drainage. Long-term practice by farmers has proven that ridging is suitable in Heilongjiang Province, where wind and rain are heavy and concentrated.

    新式农具和原有耕作法结合
    黑龙江省在大面积耕地上推广新式农具，同时吸取当地原有耕作法的优点，增产效果显著
    新华社哈尔滨26日电　黑龙江省今年在推广新式畜力农具的时候，注意吸取当地原有耕作法的优点，使六十多万公顷大秋作物的单位面积产量平均增加20％左右。
    全省使用新式畜力农具播种的二十三万公顷谷子和高粱，是在没有翻耕过的原垅上下种的。播种前不翻耕，是东北地区农民历来使用旧农具所沿用的方法，它的优点是可以减轻土壤团粒结构的破坏和保持地力。今年采用这种耕作法的谷子和高粱普遍增产，特别是春旱比较严重的地区，产量增加了50％左右。
    全省使用新式农具播种的二十一万公顷大豆和玉米，也是根据原有的经验，在早春地气上升的时候，用新式畜力农具翻耕，然后迅速下种。结果增产效果也很好。
    今年使用新式畜力农具播种的时候，还采用了随播种随起垅或播种后起垅的方法，改变了过去普遍实行平播的方法。垅作的增产效果超过平播，因为垅作可以使土地同阳光、空气的接触面扩大，减少表土被风吹走，并且有利于排涝。农民长期的实践证明，在风雨大而集中的黑龙江省，垅作是适宜的。
