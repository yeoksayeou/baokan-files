The British military adventure in the Middle East has not only brought it significant military, political, and moral failures but also created numerous economic difficulties. This is extremely serious for the already struggling British economy.

The military adventure of the Anglo-French aggression against Egypt has resulted in the interruption of shipping through the Suez Canal and the cutting off of pipelines used to plunder Middle Eastern oil. This has first and foremost confronted Britain with a severe oil supply problem.

Britain is the largest oil consumer in Western Europe, consuming over 25 million tons annually, almost entirely reliant on foreign imports. Oil in Britain is mainly used to extract gas, diesel, and gasoline, and the re-export of oil helps offset part of the international balance of payments deficit. Furthermore, oil is used in Britain for smelting ferrous metals. Currently, Britain produces approximately 7.5 to 8 million tons of steel using oil each year. Last year, the British steel industry used a total of 1.5 million tons of oil. According to the November 10th issue of the British "Economist" magazine, the British Ministry of Fuel and Power's decision on November 7th to cut oil supplies to all users by 10% will result in a loss of 15,000 tons of steel production per week in Britain. The reduction in steel will undoubtedly severely affect Britain's major export industries: machinery manufacturing, aircraft, and automobile manufacturing. In addition, half of the products of the British glass manufacturing industry require oil, and the replacement of British railways with new diesel engine locomotives next year will also increase oil consumption. Other companies, such as gas companies, central heating companies, highway, aviation, and marine transportation, also require large amounts of oil. Therefore, difficulties in oil supply will also seriously affect these enterprises.

The importance of oil to the British economy is very obvious. Of all of Britain's oil imports, 67% are imported from the Middle East via the Suez Canal and the pipelines of the Iraq Petroleum Company. Now that the canal is interrupted and the pipelines are cut off, transporting oil from the Middle East to Britain cannot avoid going around the Cape of Good Hope, adding 5,000 miles to the journey and costing an extra three weeks for each round trip. Because Western European oil tankers have relatively small tonnage, long-distance transportation will reduce the carrying capacity of these oil tankers by one-third (2 million tons) compared to when they used to pass through the canal (about 6 million tons per month), meaning they can only transport 4 million tons of oil per month. The cutting off of the Iraq Petroleum Company's pipeline will further reduce Western Europe's oil supply by 2 million tons per month. In this situation, Britain's losses are not only the increase in freight costs but also the losses suffered by British oil companies in production. According to the November 13th London "Times" estimate, these two items alone will cost Britain 13 million pounds per month, and this does not include the far greater losses caused by having to buy insufficient oil from the dollar zone at high prices.

In fact, this latter loss is the truly serious threat to Britain. To illustrate the huge cost of purchasing oil from the dollar zone, it is sufficient to point out that the import price of Middle Eastern oil at British ports (including cost, insurance, and freight) is seven pounds per ton, while the import price of oil from the dollar zone is twenty-one pounds per ton. According to the British "Economist" magazine's estimate, in the event of a disruption in the supply of Middle Eastern oil, Western Europe will have to import at least 70 million tons of oil from the dollar zone annually, of which Britain will account for one-fifth to one-quarter, and Britain will have to pay an additional 200 million pounds annually as a result. For Britain, whose gold and dollar reserves are constantly decreasing and whose trade deficit with the dollar zone is still rising, this is another fatal blow. Britain's trade deficit with the dollar zone has already reduced Britain's gold and dollar reserves from over 2.5 billion dollars in June 1955 to over 2.2 billion dollars at the end of October this year (Britain's gold and dollar reserves decreased by 84 million dollars in October compared to September) and is approaching the dangerous point of 2 billion dollars.

Thus, in order to obtain oil from the dollar zone, Britain will have to borrow from the United States, which is exactly what the United States wants. When US Secretary of State Dulles proposed the "Association of Users" plan, he revealed that the United States intended to take advantage of the difficult situation faced by Britain and France on the Suez issue to make them accept US aid and oil supplies under US control, in order to further weaken the position of Britain and France, thereby strengthening its control over them and replacing Britain and France in the Middle East. No wonder the American "Business Week" recently said gleefully: "After the long-term closure of the Suez Canal, Britain and France will have to ask the United States for economic assistance," and openly stated that oil aid "is conditional, that is, Britain and France must follow US policy."

The interruption of shipping through the Suez Canal not only affects Britain's oil supply but also seriously affects its overseas trade, especially trade with the Far East. Because Britain's export trade through the Suez Canal accounts for about 25% of its total trade. Currently, there is a shortage of shipping between Western Europe and the Far East. This is because the increased voyage has made it necessary to increase the tonnage of ships by 40% in order to maintain the original cargo volume between Britain and the regions east of the Suez Canal and Western Europe. According to British press estimates, due to the detour around the Cape of Good Hope, a round trip for a cargo ship between London and Calcutta will take 30 days longer, 7,400 miles more, and cost 18,000 pounds more; a round trip from London to Hong Kong is no longer 48 days but 65 days; a round trip between London and Singapore is no longer 41 days but 58 days; and the fastest passenger ship from London to Bombay will be 11 days slower than before. In this situation, most of the ships sailing between Western Europe and the Far East have raised freight rates by 30%, which will undoubtedly have a significant impact on Britain's exports to the Far East, Australia, and New Zealand. For example, the import price of a flax combing machine in Calcutta will increase by 15% due to the increase in freight, rising by 40 pounds. The increase in export prices will allow the markets in Australia and the Far East for British machinery, vehicle manufacturing (Britain's largest export industry), the chemical industry, and the cotton textile industry to be taken over by other countries more quickly. Australia, New Zealand, and India are the largest markets for British industrial products of this kind. Britain's exports to the Far East and Australia (especially Australia) account for about 16% of Britain's exports. Therefore, the further exclusion of these British exports from this region will be a serious blow to Britain's foreign trade.

On the import side, Britain relies on foreign imports for half of its grain and more than half of its industrial raw materials, and Australia, New Zealand, India, Ceylon, Malaya, East Africa, and Pakistan happen to be the main suppliers of British agricultural products and industrial raw materials (importing about 1 billion pounds annually). Furthermore, these imports are mostly bulky and space-consuming goods such as wheat and timber. Therefore, the interruption of the canal, the increase in voyage distance, and the rise in freight rates have a particularly large impact on Britain's imports. According to the "Times" estimate, after the interruption of the canal, Britain will have to pay an additional 2 million pounds per month in freight costs for these imported goods (the recent 30% increase in freight rates has already increased this figure to 2.6 million pounds). At the same time, it is reported that since the beginning of November, the prices of British imports such as lead, zinc, rubber, and tea have been rising one after another. The increase in the prices of imported goods will undoubtedly stimulate British prices, increase the cost of its export goods, and put it in an extremely unfavorable position in international trade and international payments.

In addition, the interruption of the canal will have a huge impact on the British shipping industry, which is an important British enterprise that relies on overseas markets and foreign trade for survival. In recent years, Britain's leading shipping industry has been seriously threatened by competition from the United States and other countries. The British shipping industry can no longer withstand further weakening due to the interruption of the canal. Another consequence of the canal interruption is that Britain's invisible income, such as oil re-exports, shipping income, and insurance income, will suffer greatly, and this invisible income plays a very important role in Britain's efforts to offset its trade deficit. According to the "British Handbook": "For more than 100 years, the prices of British imported goods (cost, insurance, and freight) have always exceeded the prices of exported goods (free on board). Under normal conditions, the import surplus has always been offset by invisible income."

Obviously, in the face of the gloomy economic prospects caused by Britain's military adventure, it is inevitable that the British economy will experience violent fluctuations. At present, especially in the financial sector, the situation of unease is becoming increasingly serious. Currently, the exchange rate of the convertible pound in London has once fallen to the lowest level since March 1954 due to the further decline in gold and dollar reserves. On November 20th, the dollar price of gold per ounce in the London market fell from $35.07 a few weeks ago to $34.95. Because Britain has to repay another installment of 180 million dollars in loans owed to the United States and Canada in December, the pound's position will inevitably deteriorate further. Therefore, it is no wonder that British public opinion is already worried about the possibility of another devaluation of the pound. The British "Manchester Guardian" has called out the cry that "the pound is in a dangerous state." The British "Economist" magazine on November 10th also said in a panic: "Now the pressure (referring to the pressure on the pound) seems to be continuing, and it seems unavoidable to spend a large amount of dollars to buy oil from the Western Hemisphere. ... Until the end of the year, seasonal factors will not improve." In fact, this is no longer a seasonal problem but a problem of a serious economic crisis aggravated by military adventures.

Eden has repeatedly emphasized this year that: "The more direct threat to Britain is less a world war than competition in export markets." This relatively sober assessment is due to the British leaders seeing that the "policy of strength" has gone bankrupt and that atomic war is a fatal danger to imperialist war provokers. Therefore, countries, including Britain, that have followed the United States in expanding armaments and preparing for war and have suffered serious difficulties can only take the road of peaceful coexistence, greatly reduce armaments, develop equal and free trade, and improve financial and economic difficulties in order to cope with export competition from the United States and other capitalist countries, and the peaceful economic competition that is increasingly placing the capitalist world at a disadvantage. However, because Britain is unwilling to abandon the outdated policy of suppressing national independence movements and even recklessly launches armed aggression against Egypt, this not only increases the threat of world war but also puts the Anglo-French aggressors in a more serious crisis in all aspects, including the economic aspect. All sober-minded British people can see that Britain must immediately extricate itself from the war of aggression in order to save the current economic crisis.

    英国发动侵埃战争的经济后果
    张振亚
    英国在中东的军事冒险不但已使它自己在军事上、政治上和道义上遭到了重大的失败，并且在经济上还产生了重重困难，这对于已经十分困难的英国经济说来，是十分严重的。
    英法侵略埃及的军事冒险的结果，已使苏伊士运河的航运中断，它掠夺中东石油的油管也被切断了。这首先使英国面临着石油供应的严重问题。
    英国是西欧最大的石油消费国家，每年消费的石油在两千五百万吨以上，几乎完全依靠国外输入。石油在英国主要是用于提取煤气、柴油和汽油，并通过石油再出口来弥补部分国际支付的逆差。此外，石油在英国还用来进行冶炼黑色金属。目前英国每年约有七百五十万吨到八百万吨钢是用石油炼出来的。去年英国炼钢工业共用了一百五十万吨石油。据11月10日英国“经济学家”杂志的估计，英国燃料和动力部11月7日决定削减一切用户10％的石油供应的结果，将使英国每周的钢产量损失一万五千吨。钢的减少无疑地将严重影响英国的主要出口业：机器制造、飞机和汽车制造等工业部门。此外，英国玻璃制造业的产品，有一半需用石油，英国铁路线明年改用新式柴油引擎机车后，也将增加石油耗费量，其他如煤气公司、中央暖气公司、公路航空船舶运输等也都需要大量石油。因此，石油供应的困难也要严重影响到这些企业。
    石油对于英国经济的重要性是十分显然的。而在英国石油的全部进口中，有67％是经苏伊士运河和伊拉克石油公司的油管从中东输入的。现在运河中断，油管被切断后，从中东运石油到英国就不能不需要绕道好望角，多走五千英里的道路，每次往返多费三个星期的时间。由于西欧的油船吨位比较小，因此长距离运输将使这些油船的载运量比从前通过运河时的载运量（每月约六百万吨）减少三分之一
  （二百万吨），即一个月只能运四百万吨油。伊拉克石油公司油管的切断则又使西欧一个月少获得二百万吨油。在这种情况下，英国所受到的损失就不仅是运费的增加，而且还有英国石油公司在生产方面所遭到的损失。据11月13日伦敦“泰晤士报”的估计，仅上述两项就会使英国每月损失一千三百万英镑，而这里还没有计算由于必须向美元区用高价买进不足的石油所造成的远为巨大的损失。
    实际上，这后一项损失才是对英国的真正严重威胁。为了说明购进美元区石油所付出的巨大代价，只要指出：中东石油在英国各港口的入口价格（包括成本、保险和水运费）是每吨七英镑，而美元区的石油入口价是每吨二十一英镑。据英国“经济学家”杂志的估计，在中东石油供应中断的情况下，西欧至少每年要从美元区输入七千万吨石油，其中英国要占五分之一到四分之一，而英国因此每年要多付出两亿多英镑。这对于黄金美元储备不断减少、对美元区的贸易赤字仍不断上升的英国，不啻又是一次致命的打击。英国对美元区的贸易逆差，已经使英国的黄金美元储备由1955年6月的二十五亿多美元降低到今年10月底的二十二亿多美元（10月底英国黄金美元储备比9月份减少了八千四百万美元）。并且将逼近二十亿美元的危险点。
    这样，英国为了要取得美元区的石油就不得不向美国贷款，而这都正是美国所求之不得的。美国国务卿杜勒斯在提出
  “使用国协会”计划时就已透露，美国打算利用英法在苏伊士问题上所处的困难处境，使英法接受美援和美国及其控制下的石油供应，以便进一步削弱英法的地位，从而加强对它们的控制，以便在中东区取英法的地位而代之。正是这样，难怪最近美国“商业周刊”得意洋洋地说：“苏伊士运河长期停航后，英、法两国将不得不向美国要求经济帮助”，并公然说，石油援助“是有条件的，那就是英法两国要遵循美国的政策。”
    苏伊士运河航运中断，不仅影响英国的石油供应，而且也严重影响着它的海外贸易，特别是同远东的贸易。因为英国途经苏伊士运河的出口贸易约占它全部贸易的25％。目前西欧同远东之间的船舶运输已出现了紧张状态。这是因为航程的增加，已经使得要维持英国同苏伊士运河以东地区和西欧之间原来的货运量，就需要增加40％的船舶吨位。据英国报刊的估计，由于绕道好望角，伦敦和加尔各答之间货船来回一次就要多花三十天时间，多航行七千四百英里，多支出一万八千英镑；从伦敦到香港每往返一趟已不是四十八天而是六十五天；伦敦和新加坡间每往返一次已不是四十一天而是五十八天；而由伦敦到孟买最快的客船也要比以往慢十一天。在这种情况下，行驶于西欧远东之间的轮船，已大半提高运价30％，而这对于英国向远东、澳大利亚和新西兰的出口，无疑地将发生重大的影响。例如，一部梳麻机的加尔各答入口价格将因运费增加15％而涨价四十英镑。出口价格的提高将使英国的机器、车辆制造业（英国最大的出口业）、化学工业以及棉纺织业在澳洲和远东的市场更快地为其他国家所夺取。澳大利亚、新西兰和印度乃是英国这类工业品的最大市场，英国在远东和澳洲（特别是澳大利亚）的出口约占英国出口的16％，因此，在这个地区的市场的进一步被排挤，对英国对外贸易将是一个严重的打击。
    在进口方面，英国一半的粮食、一半以上的工业原料都仰仗国外输入，而澳大利亚、新西兰、印度、锡兰、马来亚、东非、巴基斯坦正好是英国农产品和工业原料的主要供应者（每年输入约十亿英镑）。并且这些输入多是小麦、木材等笨重而占面积大的货物，所以运河中断，航程距离增大，运费上涨，对英国的入口影响也特别大。据“泰晤士报”的估计，运河中断后英国在这些进口物资的运费上，每月要多付出两百万英镑（最近运费上涨30％已经使这个数字增加为两百六十万英镑）。同时，据报道，从11月初开始，英国的进口物品如铅、锌、橡胶、茶叶都已纷纷涨价。进口物品价格的上涨，无疑将刺激英国的物价，提高它的出口货的成本，使它在国际贸易和国际支付上处于极不利的地位。
    除此之外，运河的中断将使英国航运业受到巨大的打击，而航运业正是依赖海外市场和对外贸易生存的英国的重要企业。近年来，英国的首屈一指的航运业已经受到美国和其他国家的竞争的严重威胁。英国航运业再也受不了由于运河中断而遭到进一步削弱。运河中断的另外一个后果是使英国无形收入如石油再出口、航运收入和保险收入等等受到很大损失，而这种无形收入在英国弥补贸易赤字方面占很重要的地位。据“英国手册”报道：“一百多年来，英国入口货的价格（成本、保险和水运费）都一直是超过出口货的价格（离岸价格）的，在正常状态下，入超部分一直是用无形收入来弥补的。”
    显然，在英国军事冒险对经济所造成的阴暗的远景前面，英国经济将出现剧烈的波动，乃是势所必然的。目前特别是在金融方面，不安的情况，已日益严重。目前伦敦可兑换的英镑的汇价已因黄金美元储备将进一步下降而一度落到1954年3月以来的最低水平。11月20日伦敦市场每盎斯黄金的美元价格已从几个星期前的三五·○七美元下跌到三四·九五美元。由于12月份英国又须偿付到期的一笔欠美国和加拿大的一亿八千万美元的借款，英镑的地位势必还要恶化。因此，难怪英国舆论已经在担心英镑再度贬值的可能性。英国“曼彻斯特卫报”喊出了“英镑处于危险状态”的呼声。11月10日英国“经济学家”杂志也惊慌地说：“现在压力（指对英镑的压力）看来还在继续，为了买西半球的石油而支出大批美元，似乎已无法避免了。……一直到年终，季节性的因素将不会好转。”实际上，这已经不是季节性的问题，而是军事冒险所加剧的严重经济危机的问题了。
    艾登今年以来就一再强调指出：对英国“存在的更直接的威胁与其说是世界大战，倒不如说是出口市场上的竞争。”这个比较清醒的估计，是由于英国领导人看到“实力政策”已经破产，原子战争对于帝国主义战争挑拨者是致命的危险，因而追随美国扩军备战的政策而使自己遭到严重困难的国家，包括英国在内，只有走和平共处的道路，大量裁减军备，发展平等自由的贸易，改善财政经济困难，才能应付美国和其他资本主义国家的出口竞争，和正在使资本主义世界日益陷于不利地位的和平经济竞赛。但是，由于英国不愿放弃镇压民族独立运动的过时政策，甚至不顾一切地对埃及进行武装侵略，这不仅使世界大战的威胁增加了，而且使英法侵略者在各方面，包括在经济方面，面临更加严重的危机。所有清醒的英国人都能看到，英国必须立刻从侵略战争中解脱出来，才能挽救目前的经济危机。
