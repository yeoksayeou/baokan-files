Xinhua News Agency, October 31st, New York dispatch: The United Nations Security Council convened an emergency meeting on the morning of October 30th at the request of the United States to discuss "measures to immediately stop Israeli military actions against Egypt." Representatives of both Egypt and Israel were invited to attend the meeting.

U.S. Representative Lodge spoke first. He emphasized the need for urgent measures to stop Israeli military operations against Egypt. He said that the U.S. government was shocked by the Israeli incursion into Egypt.

Lodge said that the U.S. government believes that the Council must act quickly to determine that a breach of peace has occurred, order an immediate halt to Israeli military operations, and state that it advocates that Israeli armed forces must immediately withdraw to the defined armistice lines (stipulated in the Israeli-Arab Armistice Agreement). Anything less than that is not enough. He said, "Members of the Security Council should ask all members of the United Nations to immediately provide assistance to facilitate the withdrawal of Israeli troops. All members should especially not provide any help that might continue or prolong hostilities. Of course, no country should use this situation to seek any selfish interests."

United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskjöld read at the meeting the appeal from the Chairman of the United Nations Palestine Truce Supervision Organization, Burns, requesting Israel to withdraw its troops and comply with the armistice agreement. Hammarskjöld said that this notice demanding a ceasefire had been delivered to both governments, but so far, no news had been received regarding the responses of the Israeli and Egyptian governments.

Yugoslav Representative Brilej condemned Israel's invasion of Egypt as a flagrant act of aggression violating the United Nations Charter. He said that such actions must be stopped. The Council must act quickly. As a first step, it must order an immediate cessation of military operations and the withdrawal of Israeli troops.

Iranian Representative Ardalan said that he believed the time had come when mere statements were not enough. The Council must fulfill its responsibilities, and if the Council's warnings were ineffective, then the Council must not hesitate any longer.

Soviet Representative Sobolev said that the Security Council was facing an extremely dangerous situation in the Near East. From what had happened, it was clear that Israel could not have done this without the encouragement and assistance of those aggressors who were not interested in peace in the Middle East and were looking for any excuse to send their troops into the Middle East.

Speaking about the news of Britain and France sending troops into the canal area, Sobolev pointed out: "It is obvious that some people are not waiting for the United Nations to take action to intervene in Near Eastern affairs. The Security Council must take action because it bears the primary responsibility for maintaining peace and security. It must take effective measures to stop Israeli aggression and make it withdraw its troops. The Security Council must issue a warning that no country has the right to use this situation for its own selfish interests. This also includes Britain and France."

British Representative Dixon, in his speech, requested the meeting to "seriously consider" Eden's statement regarding the preparation of British and French troops to occupy the Suez Canal area.

Egyptian Ambassador Loutfi said, "Israel has just carried out the most serious aggression since the signing of the armistice agreement. This aggression is likely to cause serious repercussions that cannot be ignored."

Loutfi said, "This unprovoked armed attack on Egypt is an unjustified attack, constituting an act of war and indicating Israel's expansionist policy… Egypt took action to defend itself and repel the aggression. It only took these measures after large Israeli armed forces, as well as planes and tanks, invaded Egyptian territory.”

Loutfi said, "This attack constitutes a breach of peace, and, according to the Charter, it is entirely an act of aggression. We believe that the Security Council will declare Israel an aggressor, invoke Article 7 of the Charter, and, in accordance with Article 6, expel Israel from the United Nations."

Israeli Representative Eban tried his best to defend Israel's aggression, and he indicated that he would speak again at the next meeting.

Representatives from Australia, Peru, and other countries also spoke at the morning meeting.

Xinhua News Agency, October 31st, New York dispatch: The United Nations Security Council continued to discuss Israel's invasion of Egypt on the afternoon of October 30th. Due to the veto of Britain and France, the U.S. proposal requiring Israel to immediately withdraw its armed forces to the stipulated armistice lines was rejected.

British Representative Dixon spoke twice at the meeting. He read out the main contents of Eden's statement and tried to shift the responsibility for the tense situation in the Middle East onto Egypt. Dixon said that if the fighting continued, British and French forces would move into Egypt. Dixon even described the ultimatum of Britain and France to Egypt and the conspiracy to reoccupy the canal as being for the purpose of "stopping hostilities and guaranteeing the freedom of navigation of the canal."

French Representative Cornut-Gentille supported Dixon's speech.

U.S. Representative Lodge explained the U.S. proposal, which pointed out that Israeli forces had violated the armistice agreement between Egypt and Israel by penetrating deeply into Egyptian territory, and expressed serious concern about this behavior. The proposal called on Israel to immediately withdraw its armed forces to the stipulated armistice lines, and called on all member states not to use force or the threat of force in the region in any way that is inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations; to help the United Nations ensure the integrity of the armistice agreement; and to not provide Israel with any military, economic, or financial assistance if it does not comply with this resolution.

Yugoslav Representative Brilej said: The speech of the British representative brought a most serious new element. Two members of the United Nations have apparently decided to take actions that we can only consider unilateral recourse to force. They are doing so without any authorization from the United Nations. To make matters worse, this action is mainly taken against the country that has been subjected to aggression. It can only threaten world peace and security. He requested the adoption of the U.S. proposal as quickly as possible.

Soviet Representative Sobolev pointed out that the actions of Britain and France were an attempt to take advantage of the situation created by Israel's invasion of Egypt to forcibly seize the Suez Canal by force. This action can only be seen as an aggression against Egypt. He said that the United States had submitted a proposal to the Security Council. The Soviet representative noted that this proposal lacked an important clause, namely, a clause condemning Israel. The Soviet delegation believed that there was every reason to include such a clause. However, the situation now was urgent, and the Soviet delegation would not propose any amendments and was prepared to vote in favor of the proposal. It had two important clauses, namely, requiring Israel to withdraw its troops and requiring all member states not to use force.

Israeli Representative Eban slandered Egypt extensively, insisting that Egypt was a "threat" to Israel.

Egyptian Representative Loutfi read out Egypt's request for the Council to meet in the evening to discuss the threat of the British and French governments to use force in Egypt.

After the speech by the Peruvian representative, U.S. Representative Lodge made some modifications to the U.S. proposal, inserting a new paragraph in the implementation section requesting Israel and Egypt to cease fire immediately.

Australian Representative Walker advocated that the Security Council postpone making a decision. This proposal was opposed by the U.S. representative. Soviet Representative Sobolev also expressed his opposition.

When the U.S. proposal was put to a vote, the United States, the Soviet Union, Cuba, Yugoslavia, and the Kuomintang elements voted in favor, Australia and Belgium abstained, and Britain and France voted against. According to the principle of unanimity of the great powers, the U.S. proposal was rejected.

After the vote, Soviet Representative Sobolev suggested adopting the preamble and the first paragraph of the implementation section of the rejected proposal. This form of proposal would point out Israel's invasion of Egypt, express its serious concern, and request Israel and Egypt to cease fire immediately.

Iranian Representative Ardalan expressed "extreme regret" that the U.S. proposal was rejected. He suggested a recess, and also proposed an amendment to the proposal; the amendment added a paragraph saying: requesting the Secretary-General to keep the Security Council informed of the development of the situation and to make any suggestions he deems appropriate to implement this resolution and previous resolutions, thereby ensuring international peace and security in the Middle East. Sobolev accepted the Iranian amendment and said: If he could get some assurance that the ultimatum would not take effect before the Security Council passed a resolution on this issue, then he would be more easily agree to the recess method. He once again urged a vote.

Then, Cornut-Gentille, who served as chairman, proposed a recess and immediately requested a vote on the issue according to the rules of procedure. The result of the vote was eight votes in favor, one vote against (Soviet Union), and two abstentions (United States and Yugoslavia), and the proposal for a recess was passed.

Before the recess, representatives from Iran, Yugoslavia, and the Soviet Union requested that the Council also discuss Egypt's complaint against the ultimatums of Britain and France when it reconvened in the evening. This suggestion was unanimously adopted at the meeting.

Xinhua News Agency, October 31st, New York dispatch: The United Nations Security Council continued to meet on the evening of October 30th to discuss Israel's invasion of Egypt. The meeting was presided over by Louis de Guiringaud, the French Alternate Representative to the United Nations.

The meeting passed, with seven votes in favor and four abstentions (Britain, France, Australia, and Belgium), to include on the agenda Egypt's protest letter against the ultimatums issued to Egypt by Britain and France. The letter said that “the threat to use force … is a blatant violation of Egypt’s rights and the United Nations Charter.”

British Representative Dixon opposed discussing Egypt's protest letter in his speech, insisting that discussing the letter would not contribute to the issues the meeting was to discuss.

Soviet Representative Sobolev presented the Soviet amendment to the U.S. proposal that had been rejected at the previous meeting. The Soviet recommendations were as follows:

The Security Council,
Noting that the Israeli armed forces, in violation of the armistice agreement between Egypt and Israel, have deeply penetrated Egyptian territory,
Expressing serious concern about this violation of the armistice agreement,
1. Demands that all parties concerned cease fire immediately,
2. Demands that Israel immediately withdraw its armed forces behind the armistice line,
3. Requests the Secretary-General to keep the Security Council informed of compliance with this resolution at any time, and to make any recommendations he deems appropriate to implement this resolution and previous resolutions, thereby safeguarding international peace and security in the Middle East.

The voting result of the Soviet proposal was seven votes in favor, with British and French representatives voting against, and U.S. and Belgian representatives abstaining.

Yugoslav Representative Brilej spoke after the Soviet proposal was rejected, saying that an effort to stop the war and avoid the conflagration had been rejected by Britain and France. This was a blow to the maintenance of peace and a blow to the United Nations. He expressed the hope that Britain and France could come to their senses in time and abandon the dangerous path they had embarked on.

Sobolev then spoke, saying that the Security Council had undoubtedly experienced a dark day, facing an aggression launched by a member of the United Nations, yet unable to take action. Those countries that prevented action should bear serious responsibility for this situation. He said that Israel could not have launched the aggression without the support of groups that were not concerned about peace in the Middle East.

Sobolev pointed out, what was the purpose of Britain and France asking Egypt to withdraw ten miles from the Suez Canal in the ultimatum to Egypt? It was so that British and French troops could occupy the canal. Based on this, everything becomes clear.

Next, Egyptian Representative Omer Loutfi presented Egypt’s protest against the British and French ultimatums. He said that the actions of Britain and France violated the United Nations Charter. They had twice used their veto power to prevent the Security Council from stopping Israel from implementing its aggressive plans against Egypt.

The Egyptian representative denounced the attempts by Britain and France to use the threat to the navigation of the Suez Canal as an excuse to send troops to occupy the canal area. He said that until the Security Council takes action, Egypt has no choice but to defend itself to safeguard its rights.

Sobolev again exposed the conspiracy of Britain and France to take advantage of the current situation to occupy the canal. He requested the Security Council to quickly consider Egypt’s protest and reminded the meeting of the serious consequences that the actions of Britain and France would cause.

The British and French representatives adopted the ostrich policy in their speeches, trying their best to justify their plans to send troops to occupy the canal, calling it an effort to maintain the “navigation” of the canal.

U.S. Representative Lodge called for a peaceful resolution to the problem.

Iranian Representative Ardalan spoke, pointing out that the actions of Britain and France were unjustified, and he asked them to recognize the grave responsibility they should bear for such actions.

The Australian representative spoke in defense of the actions of Britain and France.

The Yugoslav representative suggested that the Security Council members consider the possibility of convening an emergency session of the United Nations General Assembly. No one spoke on this suggestion at the meeting. The Chairman of the meeting said that he hoped that the Council members could express their opinions after the meeting.

The Chairman of the meeting also announced that the discussion of the Israeli-Jordanian border conflict scheduled for the afternoon of the 31st would be postponed to Thursday. The meeting adjourned.

    安理会召开紧急会议讨论以色列侵略埃及事件
    苏美等国要求采取措施制止以色列军事行动
    英法对埃及的武力威胁遭到许多国家代表的谴责
    据新华社31日讯　纽约消息：联合国安全理事会10月30日上午应美国的要求召开紧急会议，讨论“立即停止以色列对埃及的军事行动的措施”。埃及和以色列的代表都被邀请参加会议。
    美国代表洛奇首先发言。他强调必须采取紧急措施来制止以色列对埃及的军事行动。他说，美国政府对以色列侵入埃及这一事件感到震惊。
    洛奇说，美国政府认为，理事会必须迅速采取行动，认定已经发生破坏和平的事，命令以色列的军事行动马上停止，并且表明它主张以色列武装部队必须马上撤到（以色列—阿拉伯停战协定规定的）确定的停战线后面去。在这方面少一点都是不够的。他说：“安全理事会理事国应当要求联合国全体会员国马上提供协助来促使以色列军队撤退。全体会员国特别应当不提供任何可能继续或延长敌对行动的帮助。当然，任何一个国家不得利用这个局势来谋求任何自私的利益。”
    联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德在会上宣读了联合国巴勒斯坦停战混合委员会主席伯恩斯要求以色列撤出它的军队并遵守停战协定的呼吁书。哈马舍尔德说，这个要求停战的通知已经交给双方政府，但是到目前为止，还没有接到有关以色列和埃及两国政府的答复的消息。
    南斯拉夫代表布里列伊指责以色列侵犯埃及是破坏联合国宪章的罪恶昭彰的侵略行动，他说，这种行动必须制止。理事会必须迅速地行动起来。作为第一步，它必须命令立刻停止军事行动和撤退以色列军队。
    伊朗代表安迪让说，他认为现在已经到了光靠声明是不够的时候。理事会必须执行它的责任，如果理事会的警告不收效，那么理事会必须不再有所犹豫。
    苏联代表索波列夫说，安全理事会面临着近东的极其危险的局势。从发生的事情来看，显然，如果以色列没有那些对中东和平不感兴趣并且在寻找任何借口以使自己的军队开进中东的侵略分子的鼓励和援助，它是不可能这样做的。
    索波列夫在谈到英法派遣军队进入运河地区的消息时指出：“很明显，某些人士并不等联合国采取干预近东事务的行动。安全理事会必须采取行动，因为它负有保卫和平和安全的主要责任。它必须采取有效措施，制止以色列的侵略行为，并使其撤退军队。安全理事会必须发出警告，任何一个国家都没有权利为了它自己的私利而利用这种局势。这也包括英国和法国。”
    英国代表狄克逊在发言中要求会议“认真考虑”艾登关于英法军队准备进占苏伊士运河区的声明。
    埃及大使卢特菲说，“以色列刚刚进行了停战协定签订以来最为严重的侵略。这种侵略很可能引起严重的反响，这是不能忽视的。”
    卢特菲说，“这个对埃及的无缘无故的武装攻击是一个毫无道理的攻击，这构成了战争行为，并且表示出以色列的扩张政策。……埃及为了自卫和击退侵略采取了行动。它只是在以色列的大量武装部队以及飞机和坦克侵入埃及的领土以后才采取这些措施的。
    卢特菲说，“这个攻击构成对和平的破坏，同时，根据宪章，这完全是一个侵略行为。我们相信，安全理事会将宣布以色列是侵略者，并将援用宪章的第七条，并且根据第六条，它将把以色列驱逐出联合国。”
    以色列代表伊班竭力替以色列的侵略行为辩护，他并且表示要在下次会议上再次发言。
    在上午会议上发言的还有澳大利亚、秘鲁等国的代表。
    据新华社31日讯　纽约消息：联合国安全理事会10月30日下午继续讨论以色列侵犯埃及的问题。由于英法两国投反对票，美国提出的要求以色列立即把武装部队撤退到规定的停战线以后去的提案遭到否决。
    英国代表狄克逊在会上先后两次发言。他宣读了艾登声明的主要内容，并且力图把中东局势紧张的责任推到埃及身上。狄克逊说，如果战斗继续进行，英法部队将要进驻埃及。狄克逊甚至把英法两国对埃及的最后通牒和重新占领运河的阴谋说成是为了“使敌对行动停止并且保障运河的自由通航”。
    法国代表戈尔尼—让蒂支持狄克逊的发言。
    美国代表洛奇解释了美国的提案，这个提案指出以色列部队已经违反了埃及和以色列的停战协定而深入埃及领土，并且对这种行为表示严重的不安。提案要求以色列立即把它的武装部队撤退到规定的停战线以后去，并且要求所有会员国不要在这个地区以任何不符合联合国目的的方式使用武力或武力威胁；帮助联合国保证停战协定的完整；在以色列一旦不服从这个决议的时候就不给予它任何军事、经济或财政援助。
    南斯拉夫代表布里列伊说：英国代表的发言带来了一种最严重的新的因素。联合国的两个会员国显然决定要采取我们只能认为是单方面的诉诸武力的行动。它们在这样做的时候是没有得到联合国的任何授权的。使事情更糟的是，这种行动主要是对遭受侵略的国家采取的。它只能是威胁着世界的和平和安全。他要求尽可能快地通过美国的提案。
    苏联代表索波列夫指出，英法两国的行动是企图利用以色列侵略埃及所造成的局势，来用武力强行夺取苏伊士运河。这种行动只能看做是对埃及的侵略。他说，美国已经把一项提案提交给安全理事会。苏联代表注意到这项提案缺少一项重要的条款，这就是谴责以色列的条款。苏联代表团认为，完全有理由列入这样一项条款。但是现在情况刻不容缓，苏联代表团将不提出任何修正，并且准备投票赞成这个提案。它有两个重要的条款，那就是要求以色列撤退部队，并且要求所有会员国不使用武力。
    以色列代表伊班对埃及大肆污蔑，他硬说埃及是以色列的一个“威胁”。
    埃及代表卢特菲宣读了埃及提出的要求理事会在晚上开会讨论英国和法国政府在埃及使用武力的威胁的要求。
    在秘鲁代表发言之后，美国代表洛奇对美国提案作了一些修改，就是在实施部分插入要求以色列和埃及立即停火的新的一段。
    澳大利亚代表沃克主张安理会延期作出决定。这个主张遭到美国代表的反对。苏联代表索波列夫也表示反对。
    在表决美国提案的时候，美国、苏联、古巴、南斯拉夫和国民党分子投赞成票，澳大利亚和比利时弃权，英法两国投反对票。根据大国一致的原则，美国的提案遭到否决。
    在投票以后，苏联代表索波列夫建议通过这个被否决的提案的序言和实施部分第一段。这种形式的提案将指出以色列对埃及的入侵，表示它的严重的关切，并且要求以色列与埃及立即停火。
    伊朗代表安迪让对于美国提案遭到拒绝一点表示“极大的遗憾”。他建议休会，同时也对这项提案提出了一项修正案；修正案补充这样的一段话：要求秘书长把局势发展情况随时通知安理会。索波列夫接受了伊朗的修正案，并且说：如果能够得到某种保证使最后通牒在安全理事会通过关于这个问题的决议以前不会生效的话，那么他就会比较容易同意休会的办法。他再一次催促举行表决。
    然后，担任主席的戈尔尼—让蒂提议休会，并且根据程序规则立即要求对这个问题进行了表决。表决结果以八票对一票（苏联）和两票弃权（美国和南斯拉夫）而通过了休会的提案。
    在休会以前，伊朗、南斯拉夫和苏联代表要求在晚上再召开会议时还应该讨论埃及对英法两国最后通牒的控诉案。这个建议在会议上被一致通过。
    据新华社31日讯　纽约消息：联合国安全理事会30日晚间继续开会，讨论以色列侵犯埃及问题，会议由法国驻联合国候补代表路易·德居兰加主持。
    会议以七票赞成和四票弃权（英国、法国、澳大利亚和比利时）通过把埃及抗议英、法向埃及提出最后通牒的信列入议程，这封信说，“使用武力的威胁……是对埃及的权利和联合国宪章的彰明昭著的违犯。”
    英国代表狄克逊在发言中反对讨论埃及的抗议信，他硬说讨论这个信件不会有助于会议要讨论的问题。
    苏联代表索波列夫提出了苏联对在先前会议上被否决的美国提案的修正案。苏联的建议如下：
    安全理事会
    注意到以色列武装部队违反埃及和以色列之间的停战协定，已经深深侵入了埃及领土，
    对这种违反停战协定的情况表示严重的关怀，
    一，要求所有有关方面立即停火，
    二，要求以色列立即把它的武装部队撤退到停战线后面，
    三，要求秘书长随时把遵守这一决议的情况通知安理会，并且提出他认为适当的任何建议，以执行本决议和以前的决议，从而保障中东地区的国际和平和安全。
    苏联提案的表决结果是，七票赞成，英国和法国代表反对，美国代表和比利时代表弃权。
    南斯拉夫代表布里列伊在苏联提案遭到否决以后发言说，为了制止战争和避免战火的一次努力已经被英法否决了。这是对维护和平的一个打击，也是对联合国的一个打击。他表示希望英法能及时醒悟，放弃它们所走上的危险的道路。
    索波列夫接着发言说，安理会无疑经历了一个黑暗的日子，它面对着联合国一个会员国发动的侵略，却不能采取行动。那些阻止采取行动的国家应当对这种情况负严重的责任。他说，如果没有不关心中东和平的集团的支持，以色列是不可能发动侵略的。
    索波列夫指出，英、法在给埃及的最后通牒中要埃及从苏伊士运河撤退十英里，这是为了什么呢？是要使英法军队能够占领运河。根据这一点，一切就很明显了。
    接着，埃及代表欧默尔·卢特菲陈述埃及对英法最后通牒的抗议。他说，英法两国的行动是违反联合国宪章的。它们两次使用否决权使安理会不能制止以色列实现对埃及的侵略计划。
    埃及代表斥责英法两国企图以苏伊士运河通航受到威胁作借口，出兵占领运河区。他说，在安理会采取措施之前，埃及除了自卫以保障它的权利外，别无选择。
    索波列夫再次揭露英法两国利用目前局势占领运河的阴谋。他要求安理会迅速考虑埃及的抗议，并且提醒会议注意英法两国的行动将会引起的严重后果。
    英法两国代表在发言中采取掩耳盗铃的作法，竭力替它们出兵占领运河的计划辩解，他们把这说成是去维护运河的“通航”。
    美国代表洛奇呼吁和平解决问题。
    伊朗代表安迪让发言指出，英法两国的行动是没有理由的，他要求它们认识由于这种行动所应负的重大责任。
    澳大利亚代表发言替英、法两国的行动辩护。
    南斯拉夫代表建议安全理事会理事国开会研究召开一次联合国大会紧急会议的可能性，会上没有人就这个建议发言。会议主席说希望各理事国能在会后表示意见。
    会议主席还宣布把定在31日下午讨论的以色列—约旦边境冲突问题延期到星期四讨论。会议到此休会。
