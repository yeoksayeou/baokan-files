Reaction to Criticism

    The Zhejiang Provincial Department of Finance wrote to say: The article "Sending an Umbrella After the Rain" published on page 4 of the People's Daily on September 8th correctly criticized our department. In our province, the winter heating subsidy for 1955 was only issued to state administrative organs and institutions that followed administrative standards. Some institutions and local state-owned enterprises were not issued the subsidy, which caused a lot of complaints, but we did not seize the time to study and resolve the issue. This year, after learning that most neighboring provinces had reissued the subsidy, we began to study the matter with relevant departments in late June and decided to issue a notice in early July to reissue the subsidy. Although the problem was solved, it lost the significance of being applied during the season.
    Making cooling drinks for staff is one of the temporary measures to prevent heatstroke and lower temperatures. However, after the State Council and the Provincial People's Committee successively issued instructions on preventing heatstroke and lowering temperatures, we did not promptly put forward specific opinions on the issue of expense reimbursement. Later, some departments experienced confusion when reimbursing this expense, and after receiving letters of inquiry from various places, our department issued a notice on August 16th. The notice stated: "The funds required for administrative party and league units to make cooling drinks can be resolved within the unit's office expense surplus or employee welfare fund, and should not be listed as a separate budget item." This differs in meaning from what Comrade Yin Hong wrote: "The expenses required for various organs to make cooling drinks can be reimbursed."
    Regarding these two issues, it shows that we lack due concern for the lives of our employees, our consideration of issues is not comprehensive, and we have not actively coordinated new measures with financial work, which has led to passivity in our work. We have already conducted an inspection of this issue, learned from it, and will improve our future work.

### 对批评的反应

    对批评的反应
    浙江省财政厅来信说：9月8日人民日报第四版刊登“雨后送伞”一文，对本厅提出的批评是正确的。我省1955年冬季取暖补贴，当时发放范围只限于国家行政机关及比照行政标准执行的事业单位，而有一部分事业单位、地方国营企业没有发放，因此，引起很多意见，但我们没有抓紧时间研究解决。今年得悉邻省大部分均已补发，始于6月下旬与有关部门研究后，决定于7月初发出通知补发。虽然解决了问题，但失掉了应用季节的意义。
    机关制作清凉饮料，是防暑降温的临时措施之一。但当国务院和本省人民委员会先后发出防暑降温的指示后，我们没有及时对经费开支问题提出具体意见。后来有些部门开支该项费用时发生混乱现象，再加各地来信询问，我厅才于8月16日发出通知。通知内容是“行政党团单位制作清凉饮料所需的经费，可同意制作单位在其办公费节余或职工福利费内解决，不得另列预算开支。”这一点与印鸿同志所写
  “各机关制作清凉饮料所需的经费可以报销”的意义是有出入的。
    在这两个问题上，说明我们对职工生活缺乏应有的关心，考虑问题不全面，对于新的措施与财政工作的关系没有主动配合上去，以致造成工作上的被动。我们已对这个问题进行检查，并从中吸取教训，改进今后工作。
