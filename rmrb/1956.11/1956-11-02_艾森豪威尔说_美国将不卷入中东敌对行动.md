Xinhua News Agency, November 1st, Washington Dispatch: U.S. President Eisenhower delivered a radio address to the nation on October 31 regarding the recent developments in the international situation. In his speech, he focused on the situations in the Middle East and Eastern Europe.

    Regarding the Middle East situation, Eisenhower said, "A basic tenet of American (Middle East) policy is to support the new state of Israel while strengthening our ties with both Israel and the Arab countries." He attributed the deterioration of the Middle East situation to Egypt's policy of safeguarding its national sovereignty. He said, "We feel that this is an erroneous policy on the part of the Egyptian government." He stated, "As for Israel, it has become increasingly anxious about its security. Britain and France are increasingly concerned that Egyptian policy threatens the Suez Canal, which they consider their 'lifeline'."

    He continued, saying that recently, "the direct relations between Egypt and Israel and France have steadily deteriorated, to the point that first Israel, and then France and Britain, have determined that they cannot protect their fundamental interests without the use of force."

    Eisenhower, in addressing the armed attacks on Egypt by Israel, Britain, and France, said, "At no stage of these actions was there any consultation with the United States. Nor were we informed of these circumstances in advance. Just as any one of these countries clearly has the right to take such resolutions and actions, we also have the right to express our disagreement." He said, "We believe that taking these actions is wrong. Because we do not recognize the use of force as a widespread or appropriate tool for resolving international disputes. Saying this is by no means intended to greatly diminish our friendship with these countries, nor is it intended to greatly diminish our determination to maintain and strengthen the ties between us."

    He said, "We fully recognize the serious anxieties of Israel, Britain, and France. We know that they have repeatedly been subjected to serious provocations. However, the current facts seem very clear: the actions taken cannot be reconciled with the principles and purposes of the United Nations, which we have all agreed upon. Besides this, we must doubt whether even launching a war will be beneficial to the long-term interests of those who launch the attack."

    The U.S. President said that under the aforementioned circumstances, the United States "will not be involved in the current hostilities." He said that the aim of the U.S. government is "to do everything possible to localize the fighting and end the conflict." He expressed support for submitting the matter to the United Nations General Assembly, saying, "In the General Assembly—where there is no veto power—world opinion can be fostered to support our seeking a just way to end this vexing problem. In the past, the United Nations has proven capable of finding ways to end bloodshed. We believe that it can and will do so again."

    Eisenhower also said, "Without law, there can be no peace. And there can be no law if one set of international rules of conduct is adopted for those who oppose us, and another set for our friends."

    Another part of Eisenhower's speech addressed the situations in Poland and Hungary. He said that the consistent policy of the United States is "to seek to end" the situation that emerged in Eastern Europe after the war. He "felt encouraged" by the recent events.

    In this part of his speech, Eisenhower also mentioned the declaration issued by the Soviet government on developing and further strengthening the foundations of friendship and cooperation between the Soviet Union and other socialist countries. He deliberately expressed doubt as to "whether this declaration will truly be realized." At the same time, he said that if this declaration is realized, "the world will take the greatest step forward toward justice, trust, and understanding among nations."

### 艾森豪威尔说  美国将不卷入中东敌对行动

    艾森豪威尔说
    美国将不卷入中东敌对行动
    新华社1日讯　华盛顿消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔10月31日就最近国际局势的发展向全国发表了一篇广播演说。他在演说里着重谈到中东和东欧的局势。
    艾森豪威尔在谈到中东局势时说，“美国（中东）政策的一个基本实质是支持新国家以色列，并且在同时加强我们同以色列和阿拉伯国家两方面的联系。”他把中东局势的恶化解释为埃及实施维护民族主权的政策的结果。他说，“我们觉得这是埃及政府方面的一个错误政策。”他说：“至于以色列，它对于它的安全感到越来越焦虑。英国和法国越来越担心埃及政策威胁他们认为是他们的‘生命线’的苏伊士运河。”
    他接着说，最近“埃及同以色列和法国的直接关系不断恶化，以至于先是以色列，而后是法国还有英国，先后断定不使用武力就不能保护它们的根本利益。”
    艾森豪威尔在谈到以色列以及英国和法国对埃及实行的武装进攻说，“关于这些行动的任何阶段都丝毫没有同美国商量过。也没有事先把这些情况告诉我们过。正如这些国家的任何一国都显然有权采取这种解决和行动一样，我们也同样有权表示异议。”他说，“我们认为，采取这些行动是错误的。因为我们并不承认使用武力是解决国际纠纷的一个广泛或恰当的工具。这样说决不是要大大削弱我们和这些国家的友谊，也不是要大大减弱我们保持和加强我们间纽带的决心。”
    他说，“我们完全认识到以色列、英国和法国的严重的焦虑。我们知道，他们已经一再地受到严重的挑衅。但是，目前的事实看来很清楚：所采取的行动不能和我们大家已同意的联合国的原则和宗旨一致起来。除此以外，我们不得不怀疑，即使发动战争，那是否将长期对那些发动进攻的国家的长远利益有利。”
    美国总统说，在上述的情况下，美国“将不会卷入目前的敌对行动中去”。他说，美国政府所致力的目的是“尽全力使战斗局部化，并且结束冲突”。他表示赞成把事件提交联合国大会，他说：“在大会——那里没有否决权——上是能够促使世界的舆论支持我们寻求一个结束这个伤脑筋的问题的公正的办法的。在过去，联合国已经证明能够找到终止流血的办法。我们相信，它能够而且将会再度这样做。”
    艾森豪威尔还说，“没有法律，就不能够有和平。而假如对反对我们的人采取一种国际行为规则，而对我们的朋友又采用另外一种规则，就不能够有法律。”
    艾森豪威尔演说的另一部分谈到波兰和匈牙利的局势。他说，美国的一贯政策是“力求结束”战后在东欧出现的状况。他对最近发生的事件“感到欢欣鼓舞”。
    艾森豪威尔在这部分演说中还提到苏联政府发表的关于发展和进一步加强苏联同其他社会主义国家的友谊和合作的基础的宣言。他故意表示怀疑这个宣言“是否将真正得以实现”，同时，他又说，如果这个宣言实现的话，“世界将向各国间的正义、信任和谅解跨进最大的一步”。
