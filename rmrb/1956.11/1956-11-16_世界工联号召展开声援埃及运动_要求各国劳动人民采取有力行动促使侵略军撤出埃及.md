    Xinhua News Agency, Prague, November 15th: The executive bureau of the World Federation of Trade Unions published on the 14th a letter from the WFTU to the working people and trade unions of the world, calling for a movement in support of the working people of Egypt.
    The letter said that the WFTU executive bureau welcomes the ceasefire in Egypt, considering this ceasefire a major victory for the working people and the peoples of all countries, united to fight for the defense of peace.
    However, although the flames of war have ceased, danger still remains. The colonialists have not given up the idea of ​​restoring their rule and economic control over countries that have gained independence. The armed forces of the aggressors are now occupying Egyptian territory. As long as they stay there for one day, there is the possibility of launching another war against Egypt at any time and the danger of a general conflict.
    Therefore, the interests of the laboring people and of peace strongly demand that the troops of Britain, France, and Israel immediately withdraw from Egyptian territory.
    Working people and trade unions of all countries, of all factions! The WFTU calls on you to unite and work together to urge the aggressor troops to withdraw from Egypt immediately.
    Trade unions, laboring people, and the Egyptian people are in dire need of greater international workers' solidarity; otherwise, it will be impossible to achieve any decisive victory over the forces of aggression.
    To this end, you should strengthen the propaganda movement among the working masses to expose the purpose of the aggression against Egypt.
    You can use the methods you deem most appropriate, such as issuing petitions and adopting resolutions, to demand the withdrawal of the invading troops from Egypt.
    Firmly demand that your country's government and the United Nations General Assembly do so. Provide material assistance to the Egyptian laboring people and the people who have suffered greatly from the ravages of war.
    Raise money, food, and medicine!

    世界工联号召展开声援埃及运动
    要求各国劳动人民采取有力行动促使侵略军撤出埃及
    新华社布拉格15日电　世界工会联合会执行局14日公布了世界工联号召展开声援埃及劳动人民运动的告全世界劳动人民和工会书。
    这个文告说，世界工联执行局对在埃及的停火表示欢迎，认为这种停火是团结起来为保卫和平而斗争的劳动人民和各国人民的一个重大的胜利。
    但是，尽管战火停止，危险仍然继续存在。殖民主义者并没有放弃恢复他们统治和在经济上控制已经获得独立的国家的想法。侵略者的武装力量现在占领了埃及领土。只要他们在那里停留一天，就存在着随时再对埃及发动战争的可能性和产生普遍冲突的危险性。
    因此，劳动人民和和平的利益坚决要求英国、法国和以色列的军队立刻撤出埃及领土。
    各国的属于各种派别的劳动人民和工会！世界工联号召你们团结起来共同努力促使侵略者的军队立刻撤出埃及。
    工会、劳动人民和埃及人民非常需要更壮大的国际工人团结，否则，就不可能对侵略势力取得任何决定性的胜利。
    为此，你们应当在劳动群众当中加强宣传运动，揭露侵略埃及的目的。
    你们可以用你们认为最适当的方法，如发出请愿书和采取决议等方法，来要求侵略军队撤出埃及。
    向你们国家的政府和联合国大会坚决要求这样做。对深受战争灾害的埃及劳动人民和人民给以物资援助。
    募集金钱、粮食和医药！
