    Coasting is Not a Good Experience
    Some public bus and automotive transportation departments, in order to save fuel, are promoting a so-called "advanced experience" called "coasting operation" (using the vehicle's inertia to allow the engine to idle). While gasoline is saved, the vehicle is prone to damaging the machinery due to coasting in neutral. Moreover, in an emergency, it is difficult to brake flexibly, which can easily lead to traffic accidents. When a car is coasting, the speed naturally decreases, and a large number of cars behind the coasting car have to slow down, inevitably reducing transportation efficiency.
    Saving gasoline should be encouraged, but it is wrong to save it by reducing transportation efficiency. It is hoped that relevant departments will not blindly promote the "coasting experience."　Hu Zhongmin

### 汽车滑行不是好经验

    汽车滑行不是好经验
    有些地方的公共汽车和汽车运输部门，为了节约燃料，推广一种叫“滑行操作”（利用车辆行驶的惯性作用使发动机空转，）的“先进经验”。汽油是节省了，但汽车因空档滑行，容易损坏机器。而且遇到紧急情况，不能灵活刹车，很容易发生交通事故。汽车要滑行，速度自然减低，在滑行汽车后面的大量汽车，不得不跟着减低速度，运输效率必然降低。
    节约汽油应该提倡，但用减低运输效率的办法来节约是不对的。希望有关部门不要盲目推广“滑行经验”。　胡中民
