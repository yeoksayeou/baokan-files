National Congress of Active Elements in Socialist Construction of Families of Revolutionary Martyrs, Military Dependents, Disabled Soldiers, and Demobilized Soldiers

A Letter to Families of Revolutionary Martyrs, Military Dependents, Disabled Soldiers, and Demobilized Soldiers Across the Country

Dear Comrades, Families of Revolutionary Martyrs, Military Dependents, Disabled Soldiers, and Demobilized Soldiers across the country:

From November 5th to 17th this year, carrying everyone's hopes and with boundless excitement, we came from all parts of the country and from various production and work fronts to the capital of the motherland, Beijing, to attend the National Congress of Active Elements in Socialist Construction of Families of Revolutionary Martyrs, Military Dependents, Disabled Soldiers, and Demobilized Soldiers. At this congress, we listened to the reports of responsible comrades from the Party, the government, the army, and people's organizations, exchanged experiences gained in production or work, and discussed how we, as families of revolutionary martyrs, military dependents, disabled soldiers, and demobilized soldiers, can further play an active role in socialist construction. In particular, the responsible comrades of the Party Central Committee and our beloved Chairman Mao also met with us, which is a tremendous encouragement to us and to comrades, families of revolutionary martyrs, military dependents, disabled soldiers, and demobilized soldiers across the country.

As everyone knows, our country's socialist revolution has achieved a comprehensive and decisive victory, and our country's First Five-Year Plan for developing the national economy will soon be overfulfilled. However, to build our country from a backward country into a prosperous and strong socialist country that eliminates exploitation and poverty, we still need to do much arduous and enormous work. After our country completes the First Five-Year Plan, an even larger Second Five-Year Plan awaits us. The Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China emphatically pointed out that it is necessary to mobilize all possible forces in the country to serve the cause of accelerating our country's socialist construction and to strive to overfulfill the First Five-Year Plan and actively prepare for the Second Five-Year Plan. The convening of this congress is because the Party and the government attach particular importance to our force of families of revolutionary martyrs, military dependents, disabled soldiers, and demobilized soldiers. Through this congress, we are all mobilized to follow Chairman Mao's instruction to us to "carry forward revolutionary traditions and strive for greater glory," to give full play to our active role in socialist construction, and to make greater contributions to the motherland.

Comrades! How can we make greater contributions to our country's socialist construction? How can we live up to the Party and the government's earnest care and expectations for us? The following is the resolution we have expressed to the Party, the government, and the people of the whole country. At the same time, it is also our hope for comrades, families of revolutionary martyrs, military dependents, disabled soldiers, and demobilized soldiers across the country:

First, we must never be satisfied with the achievements we have already made, and we must always become an active force in our country's socialist construction. Our families of revolutionary martyrs, military dependents, disabled soldiers, and demobilized soldiers have all made contributions to our country's revolutionary cause, and we have also made certain achievements on all fronts of socialist construction. However, through this congress, we have further realized that the achievements we have made are inseparable from the leadership of the Party and the government and the support of the masses, and these achievements are still very small in the great cause of building our country into a socialist country. At the same time, we also deeply realize that the reason why the Party and the government care for and value us so much, and the reason why the people respect and take care of us so much in daily life and production is mainly because we all have good revolutionary traditions, and they hope that we can better play an active role in socialist construction. Therefore, we should cherish our own honor, earnestly remember the truth taught by Chairman Mao that "modesty makes one progress, and arrogance makes one lag behind," be humble and prudent, continue to advance and advance again, and strive to always be at the forefront of the masses in our country's socialist construction.

Second, we must love labor and love the production and work in our respective positions. Through this congress, we have also further realized that to build our country into a socialist country, we must have the joint efforts of people engaged in all kinds of labor. Our families of revolutionary martyrs, military dependents, disabled soldiers, and demobilized soldiers are distributed on various production and work fronts throughout the country. No matter what kind of production or work anyone is engaged in, and no matter what kind of position he holds, it is an indispensable part of socialist construction. We know that loving the production or work in our respective positions is loving socialism; doing a good job in our own positions is contributing to the socialist construction of the motherland. Therefore, we must all settle down in our positions, and we must work hard to study culture, delve into technology, familiarize ourselves with business, and constantly improve our abilities.

Third, we must carry forward our spirit of hard struggle and courage to overcome difficulties. Among our families of revolutionary martyrs, military dependents, disabled soldiers, and demobilized soldiers, there are indeed some comrades who have difficulties such as insufficient labor, physical disabilities, and frail health. To solve these difficulties, on the one hand, we must rely on the help and care of the government and the masses, and on the other hand, we also need to make the greatest efforts ourselves. Because our country is concentrating its efforts on socialist construction, the help and care of the government and the masses for us is limited. We should rely on ourselves to solve any difficulties that we can solve ourselves. Our families of revolutionary martyrs, military dependents, disabled soldiers, and demobilized soldiers all have the spirit of hard struggle and courage to overcome difficulties. We must carry forward this spirit, contribute all the strength we can contribute, and do "one's bit." In addition, we will also encounter some other obstacles in our creative labor, and we should not be intimidated by these difficulties. At this congress, the vivid examples of many comrades have shown that no matter what the difficulty is, if we do not bow to the difficulty, the difficulty will bow to us. We should bear this experience in mind, stubbornly fight against all difficulties, and give full play to our potential.

Fourth, we must strive to unite well with local cadres and the masses and advance together. Our comrades, families of revolutionary martyrs, military dependents, disabled soldiers, and demobilized soldiers, should strive to become models who are good at uniting and cooperating with others, especially comrades, disabled soldiers and demobilized soldiers, should be even more so. In this regard, we must not fail to live up to the education and training of the Party and the army for us. Our comrades, disabled soldiers and demobilized soldiers, should see the strengths of local cadres and not only see their shortcomings. Local cadres inevitably have some shortcomings, but they do have many things worthy of our learning. We cannot always think that our own opinions are correct and the other person's opinions are incorrect. We must learn from each other's strengths and make up for each other's weaknesses and help each other. For the masses, we should be more modest, set an example, and play a leading role everywhere. Only in this way can we unite everyone and advance together.

Fifth, we must become models who actively respond to the Party's call and abide by the government's policies and laws. We must know that the people respect us, the families of revolutionary martyrs, military dependents, disabled soldiers, and demobilized soldiers, very much. Therefore, we must cherish our own glory, and we must be at the forefront of the masses in responding to the Party's call and abiding by the government's policies and laws, and we must not fall behind the masses.

Sixth, we must play an active role in the cause of defending the motherland and defending world peace. We must not only often encourage our relatives and comrades-in-arms to actively strive to defend the motherland, liberate Taiwan, and consolidate world peace, but also be vigilant at all times and assist the government in eliminating all counter-revolutionary elements.

Dear comrades! The motherland's magnificent and grand socialist cause is calling us. Let all of us, comrades, families of revolutionary martyrs, military dependents, disabled soldiers, and demobilized soldiers, join hands with the people of the whole country to make greater contributions to the socialist construction of our great motherland!

Long live our great motherland!

Long live the Communist Party of China that leads us to advance towards socialism!

National Congress of Active Elements in Socialist Construction of Families of Revolutionary Martyrs, Military Dependents, Disabled Soldiers, and Demobilized Soldiers.

    全国烈属军属残废军人复员军人社会主义建设积极分子大会
    给全国烈属军属残废军人复员军人的一封信亲爱的全国烈属、军属、残废军人、复员军人同志们：
    今年11月5日到17日，我们带着大家的希望，怀着无比兴奋的心情，从全国各地、各种生产和工作战线上，来到祖国的首都北京，出席了全国烈属、军属、残废军人、复员军人社会主义建设积极分子大会。在这次大会上，我们听了党、政府、军队和人民团体负责同志的报告，互相交流了在生产或工作中所取得的经验，讨论了我们烈属、军属、残废军人、复员军人在社会主义建设中怎样进一步发挥积极作用的问题，特别是党中央的负责同志和我们敬爱的毛主席还会见了我们，这对我们和全国的烈属、军属、残废军人、复员军人同志们实在是一个莫大的鼓舞。
    大家知道，我国的社会主义革命已经取得了全面的、决定性的胜利，我国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划很快就要超额完成。但是，要把我国由一个落后的国家建设成为一个消灭剥削与贫困的、繁荣富强的社会主义国家，还需要我们做许多艰苦和巨大的工作；我国在完成了第一个五年计划以后，紧接着有更大规模的第二个五年计划在等待着我们。中国共产党第八次全国代表大会着重地指出，要动员全国一切可能动员的力量，为加速地完成我国的社会主义建设事业服务，为超额完成第一个五年计划并积极准备第二个五年计划而奋斗。这次大会的召开，就是因为党和政府特别重视我们烈属、军属、残废军人、复员军人这支力量，我们通过这次大会，全体都动员起来，遵照毛主席对我们提出的“发扬革命传统，争取更大光荣”的指示，充分发挥我们在社会主义建设中的积极作用，为祖国作出更大的贡献。
    同志们！我们怎样才能为我国的社会主义建设作出更大的贡献呢？怎样才不辜负党和政府对我们殷切的关怀和期望呢？下面就是我们向党、政府和全国人民所表示的决心，同时，也是我们向全国烈属、军属、残废军人、复员军人同志们所提出的希望：
    第一，我们绝不满足于过去已经取得的成绩，一定要永远成为我国社会主义建设中的积极力量。我们烈属、军属、残废军人、复员军人都对我国的革命事业有过贡献，在社会主义建设的各个战线上，也都作出了一定的成绩。但是，经过这次大会，使我们更进一步地认识到，我们所取得的成绩，是同党和政府的领导以及群众的支持分不开的，而且这些成绩在我国建设成为一个社会主义国家的伟大事业中，还是十分微小的。同时，我们也深深地体会到，党和政府所以这样关怀和重视我们，人民群众所以在日常生活和生产中这样尊重和照顾我们，这主要是由于我们都具有革命的优良传统，希望我们在社会主义建设中能更好地发挥积极作用。因此，我们应当珍视自己的荣誉，切实记住毛主席所教导我们的“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后”这个真理，戒骄戒躁，不断地前进、再前进，争取在我国的社会主义建设中，永远走在群众的前列。
    第二，要热爱劳动，热爱自己所在岗位上的生产和工作。经过这次大会，我们也进一步认识到，要把我国建设成为一个社会主义的国家，必须有从事各式各样劳动的人们的共同努力。我们烈属、军属、残废军人、复员军人分布在全国各种生产和工作的战线上，不管谁从事什么样的生产或者工作，也不管他担负的是什么样的职务，都是社会主义建设所不可缺少的组成部分。我们知道，热爱自己所在岗位的生产或者工作，就是热爱社会主义；在自己的岗位上很好地劳动，就是为祖国的社会主义建设贡献了力量。所以，我们大家必须安心于自己的岗位，并且要努力学习文化，钻研技术，熟悉业务，不断地提高自己的能力。
    第三，要发扬我们艰苦奋斗、勇于克服困难的精神。在我们烈属、军属、残废军人、复员军人中间，确实有一些同志存在着劳力不足、身体残废病弱等困难。解决这些困难，一方面要靠政府和群众对我们的帮助和照顾，一方面也需要我们自己作最大的努力。因为我国正在集中力量进行社会主义的建设，政府和群众对我们的帮助和照顾是有一定限度的，凡是我们自己可以解决的困难，就应当靠我们自己去解决。我们烈属、军属、残废军人和复员军人，都有艰苦奋斗、勇于克服困难的精神，我们必须发扬这种精神，贡献自己一切可能贡献的力量，做到“有一分热，发一分光”。另外，我们在进行创造性的劳动中，也还会遇到一些其他方面的阻碍，我们更不应当被这些困难吓倒。在这次大会上，许多同志的生动事例都说明了，不管是什么困难，我们不向困难低头，困难就会向我们低头。我们应当谨谨记取这个经验，顽强地向一切困难作斗争，使我们的潜在力量得到充分的发挥。
    第四，努力同当地干部和群众搞好团结，共同前进。我们烈属、军属、残废军人、复员军人同志们应当争取成为善于同别人团结合作的模范，特别是残废军人和复员军人同志们更应当这样，在这方面一定不要辜负党和部队对我们的教育和培养。我们残废军人和复员军人同志们，对于当地干部，应当看到他们的长处，不要只看到他们的短处。地方干部难免有一些缺点，但是，他们确实也有许多值得我们学习的地方。不能总认为自己的意见对，对方的意见就不对，必须取长补短，互相帮助。对于群众，我们应当更加虚心，以身作则，处处起模范带头作用。只有这样，才能团结大家，共同前进。
    第五，要成为积极响应党的号召和遵守政府政策法令的模范。要知道，人民群众对于我们烈属、军属、残废军人和复员军人是很尊重的，因此，我们必须珍爱自己的光荣，在响应党的号召和遵守政府的政策法令方面，一定要走在群众的前头，不要落在群众的后边。
    第六，要在保卫祖国和保卫世界和平的事业中发挥积极作用。我们不仅要经常鼓励自己的亲人和战友积极地为保卫祖国、解放台湾和巩固世界和平而奋斗，同时，也要时刻提高警惕，协助政府肃清一切反革命分子。
    亲爱的同志们！祖国壮丽而宏伟的社会主义事业在召唤着我们，让我们全体烈属、军属、残废军人、复员军人同志们同全国人民一道，共同为我们伟大祖国的社会主义建设事业作出更大的贡献！
    我们伟大的祖国万岁！
    领导我们向社会主义前进的中国共产党万岁！
              全国烈属、军属、残
          废军人、复员军人社会主
          义建设积极分子大会。
                  1956年11月17日
