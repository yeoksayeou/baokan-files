Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, November 25th (Xinhua News Agency reporter Ji Qun): The massive renovation project of China's first turbine manufacturing plant—the state-owned Shanghai Turbine Factory—has been basically completed. Yesterday, the National Acceptance Committee, composed of representatives from the Fourth Machine Industry Bureau of the First Ministry of Machine Building Industry, the Heavy Industry Work Department of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, and other leading departments, inspected and approved the factory's renovation project for official commencement of production.

The renovation project of the Shanghai Turbine Factory officially began in July 1954. By November of this year, the factory's newly built workshop area had increased by 4.5 times compared to before the renovation; machinery and equipment had increased fourfold. In addition, five major workshops were established, including turbine, foundry, and light metal workshops, and many large vertical lathes, precision gear grinding machines, and well-type electric heat quenching furnaces and other important equipment specifically for manufacturing turbines were installed.

The Shanghai Turbine Factory adopted the method of expanding while producing during the renovation. Last year, while the new turbine workshop was still under construction and machinery was being installed, the old factory, which manufactured diesel engines and electric hoists, successfully trial-produced China's first 6,000 kW turbine, preparing the production technology for the new turbine workshop. Yesterday, when the entire project was accepted by the state, a 12,000 kW turbine designed independently by Chinese designers had already begun final assembly in the new turbine workshop. As of yesterday's acceptance, all completed workshops in the factory had been put into production.

In the two years since the renovation project began, in addition to overfulfilling the production plans for 6,000 kW and 2,500 kW turbines, the factory also produced a large number of diesel engines and electric cranes. More than 600 apprentices throughout the factory have been trained as technicians, more than 200 technicians have been trained as technical management cadres, and 166 employees have left to support the construction of new turbine factories in other regions.

    规模巨大的上海汽轮机厂改建完成
    一万二千瓩汽轮机在新车间开始总装备
    新华社上海25日电　新华社记者季群报道：我国第一个制造汽轮机的工厂——国营上海汽轮机厂规模巨大的改建工程已经基本完成。昨天，由第一机械工业部第四机器工业管理局同中共上海市委重工业工作部等领导部门的代表组成的国家验收委员会，验收了这个厂的改建工程，批准正式投入生产。
    上海汽轮机厂的改建工程是1954年7月正式开始的。到今年11月为止，这个厂新建的厂房面积比改建以前增加了四点五倍；机器设备比过去增加了四倍。此外，还建立了汽轮机、铸工、轻金工等五个主要车间，安装了许多制造汽轮机专用的大型立车、精密磨齿机和井式电热淬火炉等重要设备。
    上海汽轮机厂是采取边生产边扩建的办法进行改建的。去年，当新的汽轮机车间还在建筑厂房安装机器的时候，在这个厂制造柴油机和电动葫芦的老厂里，试制成功了我国第一台六千瓩汽轮机，为新建汽轮机车间作好生产技术准备。昨天，当整个工程由国家验收的时候，我国设计人员自行设计的一万二千瓩汽轮机，已经在新的汽轮机车间里开始总装配。到昨天验收为止，这个厂所有建成的车间已经都投入生产。
    在改建工程开始以来的两年多的时间内，这个厂除了超额完成了六千瓩和二千五百瓩汽轮机的产量计划以外，还出产了大批柴油机和电动起重机。全厂有六百多个艺徒已经培养成为技工，有二百多个技工培养成为技术管理干部，有一百六十六个职工已经出发去外地支援新的汽轮机厂建设工程。（附图片）
