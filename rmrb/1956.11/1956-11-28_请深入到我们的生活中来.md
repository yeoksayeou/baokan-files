    Please Deepen Your Understanding of Our Lives
    Whether in our newspapers, or in dramas, films, and literary works, the reporting on the deeds of demobilized and transferred military personnel is very insufficient. Currently, there are more than five million transferred military personnel in our country, distributed on production fronts throughout the motherland. However, our reporters and writers seem unable to see this labor army. Please, come and deepen your understanding of our lives, and see how these people's soldiers are working diligently on the production front! (Veteran Xiang Xin)

    请深入到我们的生活中来
    无论在我们的报纸上或是戏剧、电影以及文艺作品中，对于转业复员军人的事迹的报道是很不够的。目前，我国转业军人已有五百多万人，分布在祖国各地生产战线上。可是我们的记者、作家似乎都看不见这支劳动大军。请你们深入到我们的生活中来吧，看看这些人民的战士是怎样地在生产战线上辛勤劳动着！（退伍军人　向新）
