Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 28th – Since late June this year, cities and counties across Liaoning Province have conducted comprehensive inspections of the resettlement work for demobilized soldiers.

The inspection in the Lüda City revealed that 643 demobilized soldiers were improperly placed, and the wages of 575 demobilized soldiers were not rationally assessed. Li Yutian, a demobilized soldier assigned to Dalian Medical College, had 15 years of textile work experience but was assigned to do odd jobs. When many cities and counties assessed the wages of demobilized soldiers, they not only failed to consider their original ranks in the military but even paid them less than current staff members of the same level. Some units stipulated a probationary period for all demobilized soldiers regardless of their specific circumstances. For example, Miao Zhenghuai, a demobilized soldier assigned to the Fuxin Power Plant, already had five years of driving experience in the military, but the power plant still required him to undergo a three-month probationary period. Some units also failed to include the military service years of demobilized soldiers in their total work experience, preventing them from enjoying labor insurance benefits. Some units lacked cultivation and education for demobilized soldiers and failed to promote them for extended periods. Among the 50 apprentices who demobilized to the Dalian Motor Factory in 1952, 11 are still first-level workers. In rural areas, some demobilized soldiers also faced improper resettlement and inadequate living assistance.

Currently, all localities have taken appropriate measures to address the problems discovered during the inspection. Thirteen demobilized soldiers at the company and platoon level working as guards and ordinary workers in the Jinzhou Storage Company and Jinzhou Textile Factory have now been promoted to cadres. In the Beishi, Beiguan, and Shenhe districts of Shenyang City, more than 890 demobilized soldiers have been reassigned to different positions and had their wage grades increased. Lüda City has already resolved 646 out of the 1,218 complaints raised by demobilized soldiers regarding improper resettlement and unreasonable wage treatment, with the remaining issues being studied for resolution. According to statistics from 12 cities and counties including Fushun, Liaozhong, and Qingyuan, more than 1,100 housing problems have been resolved for demobilized soldiers, and more than 30,000 yuan in living subsidies have been issued. Additionally, more than 400 demobilized soldiers suffering from serious chronic illnesses have been admitted to hospitals for treatment.

Following this inspection, all cities and counties have reassigned full-time cadres to strengthen the organizational structure of the demobilization and construction committees. The urban units and agricultural production cooperatives in various counties have also established preferential treatment groups, designating specific personnel to be responsible for the resettlement work of demobilized soldiers.

    复员军人安置好了没有
    辽宁各地普遍作了检查，发现了一些问题并作了纠正
    新华社沈阳28日电　辽宁省各市县从今年6月下旬开始先后普遍检查了安置复员军人的工作。
    经过检查，在旅大市发现有六百四十三名复员军人安置不当，有五百七十五名复员军人工资评得不够合理。安置在大连医学院的复员军人李玉田，原有十五年的纺织工龄，却分配他作勤杂工。许多市县评定复员军人工资的时候，不仅没有照顾他们在部队的原级别，甚至还低于目前同级的工作人员。有些单位录用复员军人的时候，不分情况一律规定试用期。如被安置在阜新发电厂的复员军人缪征淮，原来在部队里已经有五年的汽车驾驶经验，但是发电厂仍然要试用他三个月。还有些单位没有把复员军人的军龄计算到工龄内，以致他们不能享受劳动保险待遇。有的单位对复员军人缺乏培养教育，长期不予提拔。从1952年就复员到大连电机厂作徒工的五十人中，现在仍然有十一人是一级工人，回到农村的复员军人，也有安置不当和生活照顾不够的情况。
    现在各地对在检查中发现的问题，都作了适当的处理。在锦州仓储公司和锦州纺织厂的十三名作警卫和普通工的连排级复员军人，现在已经被提拔为干部。沈阳市北市、北关、沈河三个区，有八百九十多名复员军人重新调配了职务，提高了工资等级。旅大市对提出的一千二百一十八件复员军人安置不当和工资待遇不合理的意见，已经解决了六百四十六件，其余的正在逐步研究解决。据抚顺、辽中、清源等十二个市县的统计，已经为复员军人解决了一千一百多间住房问题，并且发了三万多元生活补助费，还有四百多名患有严重慢性病的复员军人已经得到入院治疗。
    经过这次检查，各市县都抽调专职干部健全了转业建设委员会机构。城市各单位和各县的农业生产合作社，也成立优抚小组，指定专人负责安置复员军人的工作。
