Xinhua News Agency, November 2nd. Mao Dun, Chairman of the Chinese Writers Association, today issued a statement on the armed aggression against Egypt by British and French imperialism.

The statement said: World peace is under serious threat, and our brothers – Egypt – have suffered barbaric aggression. The peaceful residents of Egypt have once again been subjected to the slaughter and humiliation by imperialist bandits.

The statement said: “We cherish peaceful life, and we will never forget how our peaceful life was once destroyed by the flames of imperialist war. Precisely for this reason, our deep-seated hatred is directed at the British and French imperialist bandits, and our hearts are closely connected with the hearts of the Egyptian people. With irrepressible anger, we express our strong protest against the shameful acts of aggression by British and French imperialism; with infinite passion, we express our utmost concern for our dear Egyptian brothers.”

The statement said: “The historical facts of this century prove that the independence movements of the Asian and African peoples cannot be suppressed by the guns of imperialism, and the power of the people will surely send imperialism into the grave. We express our firm support for the heroic struggle of the Egyptian people under the leadership of President Nasser.”

The statement concluded: “We, the Chinese writers, in order to defend world peace and oppose the flames of aggression, will never spare our blood and sweat. Our hearts and our pens will beat for the just struggle of Egypt."

    中国作协主席茅盾发表声明
    新华社2日讯　中国作家协会主席茅盾今天就英、法帝国主义武装侵略埃及事件发表声明。
    声明说：世界和平受到了严重的威胁，我们的弟兄——埃及遭到了野蛮的侵略。埃及的和平居民又一次地横遭帝国主义强盗们的屠杀和凌辱。
    声明说：“我们珍爱和平生活，我们也永远不会忘记，我们的和平生活曾经怎样地为帝国主义的战火所破坏。正因为这个原故，我们的刻骨的憎恨是对着英、法帝国主义强盗的，我们的心与埃及人民的心是息息相通的。我们以难以抑止的愤怒，向英、法帝国主义的可耻的侵略行为，表示强烈的抗议；我们以无限的激情向我们的亲爱的埃及弟兄，表示最大的关切。”
    声明说：“这个世纪的历史事实证明，亚非人民的独立运动不是帝国主义的枪炮所能镇压，人民的力量一定能把帝国主义送进坟墓。我们对于埃及人民在纳赛尔总统领导下所进行的英勇斗争，表示坚决支持。”
    声明最后说：“我们，中国作家们，为了保卫世界和平，反对侵略凶焰，决不吝惜我们的鲜血和热汗。我们的心和我们的笔，将为埃及的正义斗争而跳动。”
