Don't Pull Middle School Students to Do Excessive Social Work
Commentator of this newspaper

Since the autumn of last year, many secondary schools have experienced excessive social activities and heavy burdens for students. Although the situation has improved somewhat since the beginning of this semester, the problem has not been completely resolved.

Excessive social activities in schools are mainly manifested in excessive and heavy voluntary labor and social service work both inside and outside the school. The activities students participate in range from planting trees and afforestation, eliminating the four pests, building roads, demolishing city walls, accumulating fertilizer, and harvesting crops, to household registration surveys, military service registration, newspaper and magazine distribution, publicizing traffic rules, performing plays, offering flowers, and even acting as exhibition guides and receptionists for various conferences – truly all-encompassing. Some schools have their entire spare time and holidays occupied by these activities, and it is common for them to occupy class and self-study time as well. Excessive non-learning activities on campus, complex organizational structures, and frequent meetings also increase the burden on students, especially the cadres of the Communist Youth League and student unions. These excessive social activities seriously disrupt the normal order of the school, making many students live in tension, physically exhausted, and unable to have sufficient energy and time for study.

Some government departments, in their eagerness to complete planning targets, assign many tasks to the schools. These tasks are often not isolated but continuous, one after another. For example, Neixiang County No. 1 Middle School in Henan Province received the following tasks within a month: the Transportation Section required the construction of a boulevard 88 meters long and 5 meters wide within two weeks; the Water Conservancy Office required the completion of a reservoir one mu in area and 1.5 zhang in depth within one week; the farm assigned the task of fertilizing 70 mu of land; and the Transportation Section assigned the task of demolishing more than 50,000 city bricks. As a result, these tasks were barely completed, but the students' studies were severely affected.

These departments only care about completing their own tasks, disregarding the teaching work of the school, and using students as mobile labor, which is obviously inappropriate. They do not understand that schools are the main base for the country to cultivate and educate young people, and its practical action to support socialist construction is to cultivate a sufficient number of qualified construction talents for the country. When these units want the school to bear these many extra tasks, it will inevitably disrupt the normal order of the school and affect the normal learning of students.

Our schools use Marxism-Leninism as the guiding ideology for teaching. Schools should follow the principle of combining theory with practice and integrating classroom learning with extracurricular activities to cultivate young people. Therefore, students' participation in appropriate social activities has always been advocated by the school, which plays a positive role in helping students better connect their knowledge with practical life, strengthening students' labor concepts, and cultivating their qualities of serving the public. However, organizing students to participate in social activities must be carried out in a planned and led manner and be subordinate to the above-mentioned educational tasks. Some leading departments excessively organize students to participate in voluntary labor, simply pursuing economic benefits and neglecting the educational role, resulting in the lack of due effect. Therefore, local Party committees and relevant departments need to strengthen regular leadership over school work, stop some government departments from arbitrarily assigning tasks directly to schools, and stop the phenomenon of randomly pulling students to participate in excessive activities. School leaders can refuse various inappropriate requests from outside the school. Naturally, it is also incorrect to completely refuse to do social work, and attention should be paid to avoiding this as well.

Some school administrations have not effectively led student work, and many tasks that originally belonged to the school administration and teachers have fallen on the students, increasing their burden. At present, the idea of "managing teaching but not guiding" and "teaching books but not teaching people" is still quite common among many teachers. The work of class teachers is also very weak. Therefore, evaluating students' behavior, educating backward students, and handling meals have become regular tasks for some students. In response to this situation, school leaders should strengthen the work of class teachers, help teachers establish a spirit of being fully responsible for students, and mobilize all teachers to work together to educate students. Of course, to do this work well, school leaders must also pay attention to solving the problem of teachers being too busy, so that teachers have time to approach students.

Excessive activities in schools are also due to improper methods of ideological education for students in some schools. They are accustomed to using the methods of mobilizing mass movements, which are not meticulous or in-depth, increasing busyness and chaos. Therefore, in school work, it is necessary to advocate handling affairs according to the characteristics of school work, not pursuing sensational forms, and making the work more solid, deeper, and more specific. Various extracurricular activities that students like should continue to be promoted, and special attention should be paid to enriching the content of these activities and implementing the principle of voluntary participation.

Local government departments should cooperate closely with schools, care about students' learning and life, eliminate the chaotic phenomenon of students' excessive social work burden, and promote the better development of education.

    不要拉中学生去做过多的社会工作
    本报评论员
    去年秋季以来，在许多中等学校里，都发生学生社会活动过多、负担过重的现象。这学期开学以后，情况虽然有些好转，但问题并未得到彻底解决。
    学校中社会活动过多，主要表现在校内、校外的义务劳动和社会服务工作过多过重。学生参加的活动从植树造林、除四害、筑路、拆城墙、积肥、收割等，一直到户口调查、兵役登记、报刊发行、宣传交通规则、演戏、献花，甚至还要当展览会讲解员和各种会议招待员，真是无所不包。有些学校整个学期的课余时间和假日几乎都被这些活动占去，占用上课和自习时间也是经常的事情。校内非学习活动过多，组织机构庞杂，会议频繁，也加重了学生的负担，特别是青年团和学生会的干部负担更重。这些过多的社会活动，严重地干扰了学校正常的秩序，使得许多学生生活紧张，身体疲惫不堪，不能有充沛的精力和足够的时间进行学习。
    有些机关单位为了急于完成规划指标，把许多任务布置到学校里面来。这些任务往往不是个别的，而是连续不断，一个接一个。如河南内乡县第一中学在一个多月内接到的任务就有：交通科限二周内修一条八十八公尺长，五公尺宽的大道，水利办公室限一周内完成面积一亩，深度一丈五尺的蓄水池；农场布置施肥七十亩地；交通科又布置拆城砖五万多块。结果，这些任务是勉强完成了，可是，学生们的学习受到严重影响。
    这些部门只顾完成本单位的任务，不顾学校的教学工作，把学生当作机动的劳动力使用，显然是不恰当的。他们不了解学校是国家培养、教育青年的主要基地，它支援社会主义建设的实际行动就是为国家培养出足够数量的、合乎规格的建设人材。当这些单位把这许多额外的任务要学校来负担时，就不可避免地要打乱学校正常的秩序，影响学生正常的学习。
    我们的学校是以马克思列宁主义思想作为教学的指导思想的。学校要遵循理论联系实际，课内与课外相结合的原则来培养青年。因此，学生参加适当的社会活动，一直是学校所提倡的，它对于帮助学生把所学的知识更好地和实际生活联系起来，加强学生的劳动观点，培养他们为公共事业服务的品质，起着积极作用。但是，组织学生参加社会活动必须是有计划、有领导地进行，并且服从于上述教育的任务。有些领导部门过多地组织学生参加义务劳动，单纯追求经济收益，而忽略了教育作用，结果得不到应有的效果。因此，各地党委和有关部门需要切实加强对学校工作的经常领导，制止一些机关单位随意直接向学校布置任务，乱拉学生参加过多活动的现象。学校领导方面对校外各种不恰当的要求，可以拒绝。自然，完全拒绝不做社会工作也是不对的，也应当注意避免。
    有些学校行政方面没有切实把学生工作领导起来，很多本来属于学校行政和教师份内的工作都落到学生身上，加重了学生的负担。目前，在许多教师中，“管教不管导”、“教书不教人”的思想还相当普遍。班主任工作也很薄弱。因此，像评定学生操行，教育落后学生，办理伙食等，都成为一些学生的经常工作。针对着这种情况，学校领导方面要加强班主任的工作，帮助教师树立起对学生全面负责的精神，动员全体教师共同来做好教育学生的工作。当然，要做好这项工作，学校领导方面还必须注意解决教师中的忙乱问题，使教师有接近学生的时间。
    学校中的活动过多，还由于有些学校对学生进行思想教育的方法不当，他们习惯于搬用发动群众运动的方法，不细致，不深入，增加忙乱。因此，在学校工作中应提倡按照学校工作的特点办事，不要追求轰轰烈烈的形式，要把工作做得更踏实、更深入、更具体。学校中各种为学生所喜爱的课外活动要继续提倡，特别要注意充实这些活动的内容，贯彻自愿参加的原则。
    各地机关单位应当和学校通力合作，关心学生的学习和生活，消除学生社会工作负担过重的混乱现象，使教育事业更好地向前发展。
