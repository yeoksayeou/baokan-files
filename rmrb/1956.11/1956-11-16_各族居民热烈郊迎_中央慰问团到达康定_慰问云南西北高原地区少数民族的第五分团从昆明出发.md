    Residents of All Ethnic Groups Warmly Greet
    Central Delegation Arrives in Kangding
    Fifth Sub-Delegation to Comfort Ethnic Minorities in Northwest Yunnan Plateau Departs from Kunming
    Xinhua News Agency, Kangding, November 14th (Reporter Li Naiyin): Yesterday afternoon, the famous highland city of Kangding was particularly lively. The motorcade of the Central Delegation, having crossed the cloud-covered Erlang Mountain and the rushing Dadu River, arrived here. Residents of all ethnic groups, including Tibetan, Hui, and Han, in Kangding city, brought the old and the young to welcome them outside the city. From the urban area to the foot of Guo Da Mountain, the several-mile-long road was filled with welcomers. Young Tibetan girls, dressed in festive attire, danced joyous Guozhuang dances by the Kangding River to welcome the people sent by the Central Government.
    Also arriving outside the city to greet the delegation were the lamas from various monasteries in Kangding city. Holding "Ganpei" (a type of Tibetan banner) used to welcome honored guests, blowing trumpets and large horns, and beating drums, they greeted the visitors from afar.
    When the red flag of the Central Delegation appeared at the foot of the mountain, cheers erupted along the road. Representatives of various ethnic groups from counties across the Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture presented Hada scarves to Wang Weizhou, the head of the Central Delegation, and deputy heads Liu Geping, Sangji Yexi, Awang Jiacuo, and Xia Ke Daodeng. Young Pioneers rushed forward to offer flowers. As the head and deputy heads of the delegation, accompanied by Shana, the governor of the Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Fan Zhizhong, the first secretary of the CPC Ganzi Prefectural Committee, and Hu Guojun, the representative of the stationed troops, passed before the people, members of all ethnic groups threw handfuls of colored paper scraps over the delegation members, cheering, "Thank you for the care of the Central Government!"
    The streets of Kangding city were plastered with slogans welcoming the Central Delegation. A lama from a monastery told me, "We heard long ago that the Central Delegation was coming, and today we finally have."
    The Central Delegation will hold a comfort meeting and a symposium here, and the first sub-delegation will split up and go to various counties of the autonomous prefecture to conduct extensive and in-depth comfort activities.
    Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, November 14th: The fifth sub-delegation of the Central Delegation, consisting of more than ninety people, led by Zhang Chong, the deputy governor of Yunnan Province, departed from Kunming this morning to the northwest plateau region of Yunnan to comfort the Yi, Tibetan, and other ethnic groups for a period of three months.
    This comfort activity is being conducted concurrently with the Central Delegation's comforting of the Yi and Tibetan people in Sichuan Province. During the comfort activities, the delegation will further understand the demands of the local ethnic groups through forums, visits, and other forms to strengthen assistance to them.
    The delegation is carrying a large number of comfort items, including cold-weather clothing, food, radios, and dozens of other types of comfort goods, as well as relief funds. Accompanying the delegation, the acrobatic, film, and song and dance troupe of literary and artistic workers will perform for the Yi, Tibetan, and other ethnic groups; medical workers will treat diseases for the Yi, Tibetan, and other ethnic groups.
    After the delegation arrives in Lijiang, it will be divided into two groups, which will go to Ninglang, Yongsheng, Huaping and other counties where the Yi people live and to Deqin, Weixi, Zhongdian and other areas where the Tibetan people live for comfort activities.
