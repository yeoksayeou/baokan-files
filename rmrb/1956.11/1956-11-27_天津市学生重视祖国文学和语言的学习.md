Xinhua News Agency report: Since the beginning of this semester, Tianjin's regular middle schools have separated the teaching of Chinese language and literature and added classical literature courses, which has improved the quality of Chinese language teaching. Students have begun to value the study of their motherland's literature and language.

In the past, middle school students had a very poor foundation in classical literature and a very poor understanding of literary history. Some students didn't even know what country Qu Yuan was from when they took the university entrance exam. Grammatical errors and the incorrect use of punctuation marks were also common in their compositions. Since the beginning of this semester, after studying classical literary works and Chinese grammar, students have generally valued Chinese language and literature courses. Everyone has become interested in the moving stories and lyrical poems in classical literary works. Some schools' students have even established extracurricular literature study groups. As a result, students have made some progress in understanding their motherland's literary heritage and correctly using the Chinese language compared to before.

Since the separation of Chinese language and literature instruction, middle school Chinese language teachers also feel that the purpose of teaching has become clearer. In teaching, many teachers have adopted a variety of teaching methods, such as providing coherent explanations of the works and strengthening extracurricular tutoring, to consolidate students' learning results, in response to the students' poor foundation in Chinese language and classical literature. In order to further improve Chinese language teaching, many schools have studied ways to carefully select teaching materials, proposing that it is better to teach less but teach better. Schools are also doing their best to take measures such as streamlining meetings and reducing teachers' social activities, so that Chinese language teachers have more time to prepare lessons, and gradually solve the problem of the excessive burden on Chinese language teachers caused by studying teaching materials and correcting homework.

    天津市学生重视祖国文学和语言的学习
    据新华社讯　天津市普通中学自本学期开始将汉语和文学分开讲授，增设古典文学课程以后，提高了语文教学的质量，学生们开始重视祖国文学和语言的学习。
    过去中学生的古典文学基础和文学史的常识都是很差的，甚至有的学生在考大学时不知道屈原是哪国人。作文时语法不通，不能正确运用标点符号的现象也很普遍。从这学期开始学习古典文学作品和汉语语法后，学生们一般都重视汉语和文学课了。大家对古典文学作品里动人的故事和抒情的诗篇发生了兴趣。有些学校的学生还专门成立了课外文学研究小组。因此学生们在了解祖国文学遗产和正确运用汉语方面，都比以前有了一定的进步。
    中学里的语文教师自从汉语和文学分开讲授以后，也感到教学的目的性更加明确了。在教学当中，许多教师都针对学生汉语和古典文学基础较差的情况，采取了对作品进行连贯的讲解和加强课外辅导等多种多样的教学方法，来巩固学生的学习成绩。为了进一步搞好语文教学，许多学校研究了精选教材的办法，提出宁可少讲些，但要讲得好些。各学校也尽可能地采取精简会议、减少教师的社会活动等措施，使语文教师有更多的时间来备课，逐步解决语文教师因钻研教学材料和修改作业而产生的负担过重问题。
