Promote the Spirit of Hard Work and Plain Living

This year, national universities and colleges have enrolled many new students, but capital construction has not kept up in time, and there is a shortage of school buildings, which has caused many difficulties in teaching and life. The Ministry of Higher Education and the leadership of universities and colleges attach great importance to this issue and want everyone to promote the spirit of hard work and plain living and actively overcome these difficulties.

As we see from today's news in this newspaper, the number of new students at Beijing University of Political Science and Law has increased significantly this year, and there are not enough houses, and students lack dormitories. In order to overcome the difficulty of insufficient dormitories, the vice president, the secretary of the Chinese Communist Party committee, and the director of general affairs of Beijing University of Political Science and Law took the lead in giving up their dormitories and squeezing into the office to live. Under the leadership of the school leaders, many employees also moved to the office to live, thus vacating a dormitory building for students to live in, which solved the difficulty of insufficient housing. The spirit of Beijing University of Political Science and Law's administrative and party leaders closely relying on the masses and sharing weal and woe with the masses, and the spirit of hard work and plain living promoted by all teachers, students, and staff, is worthy of advocacy. Some people say: Is it appropriate to use the office as a dormitory? Their answer is: Under the current specific conditions, in order to overcome difficulties and for the cause of socialist education, why can't we do this?

In difficult material conditions, using the revolutionary spirit and methods to run schools diligently and thriftily has a fine tradition in our country. We remember that during the Anti-Japanese War, under extremely difficult material conditions, the faculty, staff, and students of the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University in Yan'an carried forward the spirit of arduous struggle, digging cave dwellings together to build new school buildings, ensuring teaching. Naturally, the teaching conditions in our universities and colleges today are many times better than they were then, and the difficulties today are much less than the difficulties at that time. The difficulty of insufficient school buildings faced by universities and colleges is only a temporary small difficulty brought about by development and progress. The faculty, staff, and students of universities and colleges should continue to promote the spirit of hard work and plain living and overcome these difficulties with full confidence.

This spirit of hard work and plain living should also be implemented in all aspects of socialist construction. The Chinese Communist Party inherited and carried forward all the fine traditions of the Chinese people, and in the environment of revolutionary struggle, it further established the style of diligence and simplicity, and hard work. After the victory of the revolution, the working conditions have improved, and the life has gradually improved, the Communist Party members should more consciously maintain the style of diligence and simplicity, and hard work, oppose extravagance and waste, oppose all styles that are divorced from the masses, carry forward the revolutionary vigor, and carry forward the spirit of dedication to socialist construction. We believe that as long as we do this, we will surely be able to lead the broad masses to advance together, overcome the difficulties on the road ahead, and strive for more and greater victories.

### 发扬艰苦朴素的作风

    发扬艰苦朴素的作风
    今年全国高等学校招收了许多新生，基本建设没有及时赶上，校舍不够用，造成了教学和生活上的许多困难。高等教育部和高等学校领导方面都非常重视这个问题，要大家发扬艰苦朴素的作风，积极克服这些困难。
    从本报今天的消息中看到，北京政法学院今年的新生数字增加很大，房屋不够用，学生缺少宿舍住。为了克服宿舍不足的困难，北京政法学院的副院长、中共党委书记和总务主任就带头把自己的宿舍让出来，挤到办公室里去住。在学校领导人员的带动下，许多职工也搬到办公室去住了，这样就让出了一幢宿舍大楼来给学生住，解决了房屋不足的困难。北京政法学院行政和党的领导人员密切依靠群众，与群众同甘共苦的精神，全院师生员工发扬了艰苦朴素的作风，是值得提倡的。有的人说：把办公室当做宿舍来住，那是不是合适呢？他们的回答是：在目前的具体条件下，为了克服困难，为了社会主义的教育事业，又为什么不可以这样做呢？
    在艰苦的物质条件下，用革命的精神和办法，勤俭办学，在我国有优良的传统。我们记得，抗日战争时期，在物质条件极端困难的情况下，延安抗日军政大学的教职员和学生，发扬艰苦卓绝的精神，一起挖窑洞建设新校舍，保证了教学。自然，我们今天高等学校的教学条件，比那时候不知要好多少倍，今天的困难不知要比那时的困难少多少。高等学校所面临的校舍不足的困难，只是发展中前进中所带来的暂时的小困难。高等学校的师生员工应当继续发扬艰苦朴素的作风，满怀信心来克服这些困难。
    这种艰苦朴素的精神，还应当贯串到社会主义建设的各方面工作中去。中国共产党承继并发扬了中国人民的一切优良传统，在革命斗争的环境中，进一步树立了勤劳朴实、艰苦奋斗的作风。在革命胜利以后，工作条件好了，生活逐步改善了，共产党员就要更加自觉地保持勤劳朴实、艰苦奋斗的作风，反对铺张浪费，反对一切脱离群众的作风，发扬革命的朝气，发扬为社会主义建设而献身的精神。我们相信，只要我们这样做，就一定能够带动广大群众一起前进，克服前进道路上的困难，争取更多更大的胜利。
