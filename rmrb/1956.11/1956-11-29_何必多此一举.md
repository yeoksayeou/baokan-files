    Why Bother?
    In April of this year, the Ministry of Light Industry, the Ministry of Food Industry, and the Ministry of Commerce issued instructions on the quality standards and acceptance methods for cigarettes, stipulating that commercial departments could refuse to accept non-qualified products. Since then, the disputes between the two cigarette factories in Xuchang City and the commercial departments over product quality have become increasingly fierce. The commercial departments claimed that the product quality was unqualified and refused to accept the goods, causing the factories to be forced to suspend production. In the second quarter alone, the losses due to work stoppages totaled over 1.2 million yuan in state taxes, profits turned over, and living subsidies for work stoppages; workers' incomes were also reduced as a result. Large quantities of products are still stockpiled in warehouses, facing the risk of spoilage.
    The cause of the dispute, on the surface, is a quality issue, but in essence, it is a sales problem. The quality of some of the products from these two factories does not meet the standards set by the three central ministries, but not all of the products are unqualified. The commercial departments refuse to accept the goods mainly because the sales plan has not been completed (for example, the Xuchang Monopoly Company only completed 48.4% of its sales plan in May), and a large number of goods are stockpiled in the warehouse. Therefore, they refuse to accept the factory's products under the pretext of "non-compliance with specifications" in order to dispose of the inventory.
    Why is there a problem with sales? The two cigarette factories recently sent people to conduct investigations in the surrounding counties and found that the traditional markets have been disrupted, and a situation of "supplying what is not demanded and demanding what is not supplied" has appeared in many markets. The products of Xuchang Yuda Cigarette Factory have been mainly sold in the eastern counties of Xuchang Prefecture for more than a decade; however, since 1955, this factory's cigarettes have not been available there. It is said that this is because the commercial departments, in order to "overcome the idea of famous brands," do not transfer this type of cigarette to this area. The "Daxi" brand cigarettes of Xuchang Cigarette Factory were also best-selling products in Yuxian County, Zhoukou, and other places in the past, but they have not been available in the market recently. The reason is also that the commercial departments do not transfer them here in order to overcome the idea of famous brands.
    Factories should improve product quality so that all products meet the standards set by the central government. However, to overcome the shortcomings of the lack of coordination between factories and commercial departments, commercial departments also need to stop the so-called "overcoming the idea of famous brands" practice of disrupting traditional product markets. This practice has caused factories to shut down, commercial departments to fail to complete sales plans, and consumers to be unable to buy their favorite products. What is the point of doing this?

### 何必多此一举

    何必多此一举
    今年4月，中央轻工业部、食品工业部、商业部发下了卷烟质量标准和验收办法的指示，规定：非合格品商业部门可以拒绝收货。从此以后，许昌市的两个卷烟厂和商业部门对产品质量的争执就越来越厉害了。商业部门说产品质量不合格，不收货，致使工厂被迫停工。仅第二季度因停工共损失国家税收、上缴利润、停工生活补助费等一百二十万元以上；工人的收入也因而减少。大批的产品还积压在仓库里，面临着霉坏的危险。
    争执的原因，从表面上看是质量问题，实质上是销路问题。这两个厂的部分产品质量的确不合乎中央三个部规定的标准，但并不是所有产品的质量都不合标准。商业部门所以拒绝收货，主要是因为销售计划一直完不成（如许昌专卖公司5月份只完成销售计划的48.4％），仓库里积压着大批商品，于是就以“不合规格”为理由拒绝收工厂的产品，以便处理积压。
    销路为什么成问题呢？这两个烟厂最近派人到周围各县进行调查，发现传统市场被打乱了，许多市场上出现了“供非所求，求非所供”的情况。许昌裕大烟厂的产品多销在许昌专区东部各县，已有十几年的历史；但自1955年以来，这里已经买不到这个厂的烟了。据说这是商业部门为了“克服名牌货思想”才不往这里调运这种烟的。许昌烟厂的“大喜”牌等卷烟，以前在禹县、周口等地也是畅销货，近来市场上也买不到了。原因也是商业部门为了克服名牌货思想而不往这里调运。
    工厂应该提高产品质量，使一切产品质量都达到中央规定的标准。但是要克服工厂和商业部门关系不协调的缺点，还需要商业部门停止那种打乱产品传统市场的所谓“克服名牌货思想”的做法。这种做法，弄得工厂停工，商业部门完不成销售计划，消费者买不到自己喜爱的产品。这真是何苦来呢？                          庄在兹
