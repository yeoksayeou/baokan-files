Esteemed Gentlemen, Comrades:

Today is the ninetieth anniversary of the birth of Mr. Sun Yat-sen. Mr. Sun Yat-sen's life was one of revolutionary struggle, one of striving for the freedom and equality of the motherland. All of our compatriots throughout the country commemorate this great revolutionary leader of a generation with unparalleled enthusiasm, expressing infinite remembrance and lofty respect for him!

Mr. Sun Yat-sen was born in 1866, precisely during a period of major changes in Chinese history. On the one hand, imperialist aggression against China deepened step by step, imposing a series of unequal treaties on the Chinese people, turning China into a semi-feudal and semi-colonial society, and the Qing Dynasty government became a tool of foreign aggressors. On the other hand, the Chinese people gradually awakened and launched struggles against domestic and foreign oppressors, one after another. Although the great Taiping Heavenly Kingdom revolutionary movement failed due to the combined attacks of the Qing government and imperialism, the seeds of revolution it sowed could not be extinguished. In his childhood, Mr. Sun Yat-sen liked to listen to the stories of Hong and Yang. The Taiping Heavenly Kingdom revolutionary movement undoubtedly had a certain influence on the germination of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary ideas. After the successive defeats in the Sino-French War and the Sino-Japanese War, the crisis of the Chinese nation deepened further, and it was during this period that Mr. Sun Yat-sen made up his mind to overthrow the imperial system and establish a republic. In Chinese history, Mr. Sun Yat-sen was not only the first person to propose the ideal of "establishing a republic" to the Chinese people, but also, under very difficult conditions, organized and led the revolutionary movement and carried out a long-term and resolute struggle for this ideal. After many failures, he finally achieved the great victory of overthrowing the rule of the Qing Dynasty and ending more than two thousand years of feudal imperial system in China in 1911. Although the Revolution of 1911 did not achieve the ideal of establishing an independent and consolidated democratic republic, the destruction of the feudal imperial system after all opened up a broad road for the Chinese national liberation movement. This is the immortal achievement of the Tongmenghui, headed by Mr. Sun Yat-sen, which will forever be a glorious page in Chinese history! After the failure of the Revolution of 1911, Mr. Sun Yat-sen led the people of the whole country to continue their unyielding struggle against the Northern Warlords, but under the situation where the warlords colluded with imperialism, these struggles did not succeed and were directly or indirectly sabotaged by foreign imperialism. In 1917, the great October Socialist Revolution took place in Russia, and in 1921, the Chinese working class established its own political party, the Communist Party of China. Mr. Sun Yat-sen welcomed the October Revolution, welcomed the assistance of the Russians to the Chinese, and welcomed the cooperation of the Communist Party of China with him. He warned the right-wing diehards within the Kuomintang who opposed cooperation with the Communist Party: "If you oppose it again, I will dissolve the Kuomintang and join the Communist Party myself." He pointed out: "There will be no achievement in the future revolution without taking Russia as a teacher." He resolutely overcame all obstacles and difficulties, accepted the assistance given to him by the socialist Soviet Union and the Communist Party of China, adopted the revolutionary three major policies of alliance with Russia, alliance with the Communist Party, and assistance to workers and peasants, and reorganized the Kuomintang he led on the basis of the three major policies. In the declaration of the First National Congress of the Kuomintang after the reorganization, Mr. Sun Yat-sen re-explained the Three People's Principles and explicitly put forward the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal program. Chairman Mao Zedong once pointed out in "On Coalition Government": "...The basic principles of the Three People's Principles explained by Mr. Sun Yat-sen in the 'Declaration of the First National Congress of the Chinese Kuomintang' in 1924 are consistent with some of the basic principles in our party's program at the present stage, that is, the minimum program." Chairman Mao's scientific historical evaluation demonstrates the height reached by Mr. Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary democracy in its forward development; this major development brought Mr. Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary cause to its peak.

Mr. Sun Yat-sen was great not only because he struggled tirelessly for the revolution all his life, but also because of his far-sightedness, and all his policies were determined according to the needs of Chinese national independence and freedom, not according to the interests of a few people. When he saw through the reactionary corruption of the Qing government, he resolutely abandoned the illusion of implementing reforms through the Qing court and launched a resolute struggle against the reformists represented by Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao. When he realized that imperialism was the greatest scourge of China, he declared: "There was a period in the past when we worked hard to overthrow the Manchu Qing. Now we will start a period to work hard to overthrow imperialist interference in China..." When the October Socialist Revolution occurred in Russia, he warmly hailed this revolution. When the Chinese working class formed an independent political force, he resolutely relied on this force. He declared that he was a friend of socialism, pointing out that "the French and American republics are old-fashioned, and today only Russia is new-fashioned. We should create a newest-style republic today." And he carried out a resolute struggle for its realization. It is precisely because Mr. Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary thought was constantly "adapted to the trend of the world and conformed to the needs of the people" that he was able to become an outstanding revolutionary and a great patriot.

As a great revolutionary, Mr. Sun Yat-sen, while striving for the freedom and equality of his motherland, also held deep concern and sympathy for the fate of the oppressed people of the world, especially for the fate of the various Asian nations that were then under imperialist bullying and oppression. He once angrily condemned the imperialists, saying: "They use a few people to restrict the majority of people in this continent and this country, and even extend that kind of scourge to Asia to suppress our vast majority of 900 million people and make them slaves of their few people. This is really very cruel and extremely hateful!" At the same time, he pointed out that the Asian nations could only succeed in their independent movements if they "united together." Through decades of revolutionary practice, Mr. Sun Yat-sen summarized a valuable experience. This is "...we must awaken the masses and unite with the nations of the world that treat us equally to fight together." "Awakening the masses" requires supporting the workers' movement and the peasants' movement, and cooperating with the Communist Party that represents the broad masses of working people; and to unite with the nations of the world that treat us equally, we must first unite with the socialist Soviet Union. Over the past thirty years, the victory of the Chinese revolution and the victory of many national liberation struggles in the world have proved that this experience is completely correct.

Mr. Sun Yat-sen struggled for the freedom and equality of the motherland throughout his life and longed for a "world in which the great way prevails." Therefore, he also yearned for the arrival of a socialist society. He said: "We not only cannot say that communism conflicts with the Principle of People's Livelihood, but it is also a good friend." "I welcome socialism as a sacred thing that benefits the country and benefits the people. It is the truth of society that gathers all kinds of productive things and makes them public, and receives their benefits. On the day when socialism is implemented, my people will be taught when they are young, supported when they are old, engage in specialized operations, and everyone will get what they need." This shows that Mr. Sun Yat-sen was enthusiastically inclined towards socialism. The great Communist Party of China carries forward the past and opens up the future. It summarizes the experience of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary struggle with scientific Marxism-Leninism and inherits the precious heritage of our ancestors, including Mr. Sun Yat-sen. In the thirty years since Sun Yat-sen's death, the Communist Party of China has led the Chinese people to completely complete the new democratic revolution and has achieved a decisive victory in the socialist revolution. Today, our people enjoy the fullest democracy and freedom, our society has basically eliminated the phenomenon of man exploiting man; all ethnic groups are completely equal in politics, economy, and culture; various democratic parties will "coexist for a long time and supervise each other" with the Communist Party, and the good working relationship between the parties over the years has created an excellent example for multi-party cooperation under the socialist system. Our country's international status has been raised to an unprecedented level; we have unbreakable and eternal unity and friendship with the great Soviet Union and other socialist countries; in the socialist international family headed by the Soviet Union, there is no gap or suspicion between each other, only brotherly concern and selfless support. "A world in which the great way prevails" may have been a vague vision or an unattainable ideal a few years ago, but today it has become a reality in the lives of more than 900 million people around the world. This is what we can tell Mr. Sun Yat-sen when we commemorate the great revolutionary leader of a generation in China today. The era we live in today is greater than the era Mr. Sun Yat-sen lived in, and the goals we pursue today are greater than the goals Mr. Sun Yat-sen pursued at that time. All those who have followed Mr. Sun Yat-sen, all those who have believed in Mr. Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary propositions, and all the broad patriotic overseas Chinese who have supported and supported Mr. Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary cause should inherit Mr. Sun Yat-sen's glorious revolutionary tradition, carry forward Mr. Sun Yat-sen's spirit of continuous progress, and contribute all their talents and strength to the extremely glorious cause of building our country into a great socialist country and in the sacred struggle against imperialist aggression and defending world peace. In this way, we will not fail the great era we live in, and we will not fail the great patriot and revolutionary Mr. Sun Yat-sen!

### 中国国民党革命委员会主席  李济深的讲话

    中国国民党革命委员会主席
    李济深的讲话各位先生、各位同志：
    今天是孙中山先生诞辰的九十周年。孙中山先生的一生，是革命奋斗的一生，是争取祖国自由平等的一生。我们全国同胞都以无比热烈的心情，来纪念这位一代伟大革命领袖，对他表示无限的追思和崇高的敬意！
    孙中山先生诞生于1866年，正当中国历史发生重大变化的时期。一方面，帝国主义对中国的侵略步步深入，把一连串的不平等条约强加在中国人民身上，使中国沦为一个半封建、半殖民地的社会，清朝政府变成了外国侵略者的工具。另一方面，中国人民逐渐觉醒，彼伏此起地展开反抗内外压迫者的斗争。伟大的太平天国革命运动虽然因为受到清朝政府和帝国主义的联合进攻而告失败了，但是它所散播的革命火种却是不能扑灭的。孙中山先生幼年，就喜欢听洪杨故事，太平天国革命运动对于孙中山先生革命思想的萌芽，无疑地起了一定的影响。中法战争、中日战争相继失败之后，中国民族的危机更加深重，孙中山先生也就在这个时期下定了推翻帝制，建立民国的决心。在中国历史上，孙中山先生不仅是第一个向中国人民提出“建立民国”理想的人，而且在非常困难的条件下，组织和领导革命运动，为这个理想进行了长期的坚决的斗争。经过了许多次的失败，终于在1911年取得了推翻清朝统治，结束中国两千多年封建帝制的伟大胜利。虽然辛亥革命并没有能够实现建立独立的、巩固的民主共和国的理想，但是封建帝制的摧毁，毕竟为中国民族解放运动打开了一条广阔的道路。这是以孙中山先生为首的同盟会不朽的功勋，在中国历史上永远是光辉灿烂的一页！辛亥革命失败以后，孙中山先生领导全国人民继续对北洋军阀进行不屈不挠的斗争，但是在军阀与帝国主义相勾结的形势下，这些斗争并没有得到成功，都被外国帝国主义直接间接破坏了。1917年俄国发生了伟大的十月社会主义革命，1921年中国工人阶级成立了自己的政党中国共产党。孙中山先生欢迎十月革命，欢迎俄国人对中国人的援助，欢迎中国共产党和他合作。他警告国民党内部反对同共产党合作的右派顽固分子说：“你们如再反对，我就解散国民党，自己去加入共产党好了。”他指出：“今后之革命，非以俄为师断无成就。”他毅然决然排除一切阻挠和困难，接受了社会主义苏联和中国共产党给予他的援助，采取了联俄、联共、扶助工农运动的革命三大政策，并且在三大政策基础上改组了他所领导的国民党。在改组后的国民党第一次全国代表大会宣言中，孙中山先生重新解释了三民主义，明确提出了反帝反封建的纲领。毛泽东主席在“论联合政府”中曾经指出：“……孙中山先生在1924年
  ‘中国国民党第一次全国代表大会宣言’里所解释的三民主义的基本原则，同我党在现阶段的纲领即最低纲领里的若干基本原则，是互相一致的。”毛主席这个科学的历史评价，说明了孙中山先生的革命民主主义在它向前发展中所达到的高度；这个重大的发展，使孙中山先生的革命事业达到了它的最高峰。
    孙中山先生之所以伟大，不仅在于他终生为革命奋斗不懈，更在于他的眼光远大，一切政策都是按照中国民族独立和自由的需要而不是按照少数人的利益来决定的，当他看透了清朝政府的反动腐败，他就决然抛弃通过清廷实行改革的幻想，对以康有为、梁启超为代表的改良派展开坚决的斗争。当他认识到帝国主义是中国最大的祸害，他就宣言：“从前有一时期，为努力推翻满清。今将开始一时期，为努力推翻帝国主义之干涉中国……。”俄国发生了十月社会主义革命，他就热烈欢呼这个革命。中国工人阶级形成了独立的政治力量，他就坚决依靠这个力量。他宣布他是社会主义的朋友，指出“法美共和皆旧式的，今日惟俄国是新式的，吾人今日应造成一最新式的共和国”。并且为它的实现进行了坚决的斗争。正因为孙中山先生的革命思想是这样不断地“适乎世界之潮流，合乎人群之需要”，所以他能够成为一个杰出的革命家，伟大的爱国者。
    作为一个伟大的革命家，孙中山先生在为自己的祖国争取自由平等的同时，对于全世界被压迫的人民的命运，特别是对于当时处在帝国主义欺凌压榨下的亚洲各个民族的命运，是抱着深切的关怀和同情的。他曾经愤怒地谴责帝国主义者说：“他们用少数人既是限制了本洲和本国的多数人，更把那种流毒推广到亚洲，来压制我们九万万的大多数，做他们少数人的奴隶，这真是非常残酷，真是可恶已极！”他同时指出，亚洲民族唯有“联络起来，然后亚洲全部民族的独立运动，才可以成功。”孙中山先生通过数十年的革命实践，总结出了一条宝贵的经验。这就是“……必须唤起民众及联合世界上以平等待我之民族共同奋斗。”“唤起民众”就必须支持工人运动和农民运动，同代表广大劳动人民的共产党合作；而联合世界上以平等待我之民族，首先必须联合社会主义的苏联。三十年来，中国革命的胜利以及世界许多民族解放斗争的胜利，都证明这条经验是完全正确的。
    孙中山先生为争取祖国的自由平等奋斗了一生。更向往着一个“大道之行也天下为公”的大同世界。因此他也渴望社会主义社会的到来。他说：“我们对于共产主义不但不能说是和民生主义相冲突，并且是一个好朋友。”“鄙人对于社会主义，实欢迎其为利国福民之神圣。本社会之真理，集种种生产之物，归为公有，而收其利。实行社会主义之日，即我民幼有所教，老有所养，分业操作，各得其所”。这说明孙中山先生是热烈倾向于社会主义的。伟大的中国共产党继往开来，它以科学的马克思列宁主义总结了孙中山先生革命斗争的经验，继承了我们先人包括孙中山先生在内的珍贵遗产。在孙中山逝世以后的三十年间，中国共产党领导中国人民彻底完成了新民主革命，并且取得了社会主义革命的决定性的胜利。今天，我国人民享受着最充分的民主自由，我们的社会已经基本上消灭了人剥削人的现象；各个民族在政治经济文化各方面是完全平等的；各民主党派将与共产党“长期共存、互相监督”，而各党派多年来良好的共事关系，已经为社会主义制度下的多党合作创造了优良的范例。我国的国际地位空前提高；我们同伟大的苏联和其他社会主义国家有着牢不可破的永恒的团结和友谊；在以苏联为首的社会主义国际大家庭里，相互之间没有任何隔膜或猜忌，只有兄弟般的关切和无私的支援。 “天下为公”如果在若干年前还是一种模糊的憧憬或者是一种高不可扳的理想，而今天已经变成世界九万万多人民生活中的现实了。这是我们今天纪念中国一代伟大革命领袖孙中山先生时可以告慰于他的。我们今天所处的时代比孙中山先生所处的时代更为伟大，我们今天所追逐的目标也比孙中山先生当时所追逐的目标更为远大。所有追随过孙中山先生的人们，所有信仰过孙中山先生的革命主张的人们，所有支持和拥护过孙中山先生革命事业的广大爱国侨胞们，都应该继承孙中山先生的光荣革命传统，发扬孙中山先生不断进步的精神，在把我国建设成为一个伟大的社会主义国家的极其光荣的事业中，在反对帝国主义侵略、保卫世界和平的神圣斗争中，贡献出自己的一切才智和力量。这样，才无负于我们所处的伟大的时代，也才无负于伟大的爱国者和革命家孙中山先生！
