    Green Waters, Lush Mountains, and Fertile Fields
    By Our Reporter Liǔ Bāng
    As soon as I arrived in Dengjiabao (in Wushan County, Gansu), I heard people praising the four rarities of this year: contiguous cultivated land; the appearance of summer fields yielding 400 *jin* per *mu*; rice growing on the mountains; and raising ducks in the water stored in the gullies. These are all very ordinary things in ordinary rural areas, but in this rugged, severely eroded, cold, arid loess mountain area, they are indeed rare. Comrade Kong Fengzhong, from the Wushan County People's Committee Water and Soil Conservation Work Group stationed in Dengjiabao, accompanied me on a tour of the new landscape of this mountain village while telling me about its history of vicissitudes:
    Dengjiabao Village is located on a hillside on the south bank of the Wei River. It includes four small villages: Dengjiabao, Majiashan, Zhangjiabao, and Lijiaping. Almost all of the more than 2,000 *mu* of cultivated land are scattered, small plots of steep mountain land. Half of the annual rainfall here is concentrated in June, July, and August. Coupled with the early destruction of forests and grasslands, a rainstorm often causes mud and water to pour down the mountains, carrying away the fertile soil and leaving behind a hard base. Year after year, good fields turn into gullies. In 1929, this small village with fewer than 100 people starved to death 37 people, and five households fled the famine. This was the outline of Dengjiabao before 1952.
    Today, as we stroll here, although we can still see traces of soil erosion on the soil layers at the foot of the cliffs, the slopes are already terraced, covered with sorghum and millet. Almost all the edges of the cultivated land are lined with neat ridges. Some of the ridges are even fitted with soft weirs. From 1952 to the end of last year, the cultivated land with ridges accounted for about 97% of the total cultivated land area (individual red clay areas are not suitable for ridges), basically achieving "every piece of land has a ridge, and every ridge is connected." Soft weirs are a new creation in recent years. Like ridges, they can block water and silt, but their unique feature is that they do not take up land. Therefore, the farmers say: "One *mu* of land, three weirs, what should yield eight *dou* will yield one *dan*." Years of effort have made most of the steep mountain land that had been fragmented for many years into contiguous flat land. The largest piece is 50 *mu*, and the smallest is 7 or 8 *mu*. This is what the local farmers praise as the "first rarity."
    The contiguity of the land has created conditions for the use of new agricultural tools and other agricultural technology reforms. This has led to the "second rarity" of Dengjiabao - a summer field yield of 400 *jin* per *mu*. Just after liberation, the yield per *mu* of grain in this area was only about 80 *jin*. Among the 25 households in Dengjiabao, 91% lacked food for four months of the year. The whole village had only three cotton quilts. Almost no woman was able to wear cotton trousers. What about now? Except for two households with fewer laborers and more children who are still temporarily in difficulty, everyone else is already well-fed and well-clothed, with clothes to wear, things to use, and bedding to cover. Last year, the 44 households in the entire administrative village sold a total of 9,632 *jin* of surplus grain to the state. It is estimated that the number of surplus grain sold this year will increase greatly. The young farmer Deng Yaoqing, who hosted us for dinner at his home, has a family of four, two laborers, and did a total of 450 workdays this year. The average income per person is more than 1,000 *jin* of grain. In recent years, more than 60 new tile-roofed houses have been built in the village.
    While saying this, the host led me to continue climbing a winding mountain road. Just over a ridge, I saw a golden wave of rice undulating in the wind. Planting rice in this high mountain, arid place is a bold attempt. An ear of rice is as long as five or six inches. I casually picked an ear and counted it. The plump grains amounted to more than 140. According to the estimation of old farmers, such rice can yield more than 420 *jin* of rice per *mu*. Changing dry land to paddy fields and replacing low-yielding crops with high-yielding crops has rapidly increased the yield here. Currently, Dengjiabao already has more than 600 *mu* of irrigated land.
    "So, where does the water come from?"
    Unexpectedly, my question about water aroused the infinite emotion of Deng Junjie, a model water and soil conservation worker and organization committee member of the Dengjiabao branch of the Communist Party. He first told me a story about water:
    Before water and soil conservation, when it rained in Dengjiabao, houses and good fields were washed away, and cattle and livestock were drowned; but once the rain stopped and the sky cleared, the whole village worried about drinking water for people and animals - drinking water had to be carried from five or six *li* away. At that time, it was like marrying a fairy from the sky for a man from Dengjiabao to marry a girl from another village. Because the girls were not only afraid of starving when they married into this poor mountain village, but also afraid of being thirsty. Deng Jia-dai and Lin Pingxi's sister from Linjia Village fell in love with each other, but because the woman's parents disliked Dengjiabao's lack of water, the two lovers were ultimately unable to get married. Grandpa Ma Laicheng couldn't bear the lack of water and moved his family to Xiakou. Speaking of this, Deng Junjie suddenly smiled and said, "This old man in his eighties is back this year!"
    We came to the front of the Kangjia Gou dam. This gully used to be a major disaster for Dengjiabao. In 1953, the rain even bit off a section of the Longhai Railway access road. Later, people planted trees and grass around it. This year, they built an earthen dam, 38 meters long and 11 meters high, across the middle, forming a clear, green artificial lake. The water here can irrigate 350 *mu* of nearby land, increasing grain production by 28,000 *jin* a year.
    Coming to Qiaozi Gou, I witnessed another way to manage gullies. In the past, Qiaozi Gou was the "culprit" among the dozen or so large gullies in this mountain village. Later, people built 78 willow-insertion check dams on it to block mountain torrents and retain sediment. The originally steep bottom of the gully has now silted up into pieces of flat land. Planting alfalfa in these fields yielded 4,800 *jin* last year.
    In the Northwest Plateau, seeing those dilapidated, unmanaged gullies is really worrying. When will people be able to transform those damaged lands? After seeing these newly managed gullies, it seems that turning barren land into green mountains is not a vague myth - the huge changes in Qiaozi Gou have only taken four or five years!
    Dengjiabao once took a detour on the issue of water and soil conservation policy. In 1952, when the Longnan Water and Soil Conservation Work Group came to Dengjiabao to start work, there was a tendency to neglect field projects and simply build dams in gullies. In 1953, the village built 67 dams, and in 1954, the number increased to 204. Unexpectedly, in the autumn of that year, 67 millimeters of torrential rain fell in four hours, and 90% of the earthen dams that people had worked so hard to build for two or three years were washed away. At that time, the sorghum and millet in the fields were flattened, and the potato tubers were turned out of the soil. The whole village sighed - what a painful lesson!
    On June 5 this year, Dengjiabao experienced an even more violent rainstorm than in 1954 - 39 millimeters fell in ten minutes. However, Dengjiabao's earthen dams and crops were safe and sound. Why? Li Xuding, the secretary of the village Communist Youth League branch and an attendee at the National Youth Socialist Construction Activists Conference, smiled and replied to me: The current earthen dams are all built with "reinforced concrete"! I understand what he means. He is referring to the fact that every water and soil conservation project now implements the principle of comprehensive management.
    After the heavy rain in 1954, the work group thoroughly studied the reasons for the dam failure and found that the masses had accumulated a lot of water and soil conservation experience in the long-term struggle against natural disasters. For example, Dengjiabao has long circulated the saying: "Water is a dragon, it first goes from the top of the mountain. If you only manage the bottom and not the top, all your efforts will be in vain." This shows that water and soil conservation must adhere to the principle of comprehensive management. "The size of the water pond doesn't matter, the location selection is important." This shows that farmers do not agree with blindly building large projects. "Usually (doing water and soil conservation) does not interfere with farming, comprehensively tackling it during rain, and comparing achievements after rain." This shows that the masses know how to reasonably allocate the time for farming and water and soil conservation work. "Plum blossom pillars are continuously rammed, one adjustment of six rammings with three reverse cavities." "Add a layer of soil, ram it once, and the grain yield will increase by half next year." This shows that farmers value project quality. This year, the masses of Dengjiabao creatively used the method of "moving forward with thorns and planting with borrowed soil" (mixing seeds and soil and spreading it on the cliff with a shovel) on the steep cliffs of the Dagongou, which is 20 *zhang* high, and planted 5 *mu* of alfalfa. On the watershed, according to different terrains, they dug 5,000 fish-scale, swallow-wing, and spiral-shaped water storage and soil conservation horizontal ditches, and planted 100,000 *Boji* willows. Farmers call this tree a money tree - by next autumn, each willow can weave two *boji*. Each *boji* is worth 75 cents. The income from 100,000 willows is 150,000 yuan. Relying on the wisdom of the masses, based on natural characteristics, through comprehensive planning, and adopting comprehensive measures for agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and water, Dengjiabao has achieved remarkable results in water and soil conservation.
    This mountain village, which has controlled soil erosion accounting for 80% of the land area, basically achieving "water does not go down the plateau, soil does not go down the slope, mud does not go out of the gully, and sand does not cover the land," has not received national investment in recent years, but has completely relied on the strength of the masses to rapidly change its living environment and natural appearance.

    绿水青山膏腴田
    本报记者　柳梆
    一到邓家堡（在甘肃武山县），就听人在夸今年这里的四大稀罕：耕地连片；出现四百斤的夏田；水稻上山；沟里蓄水养鸭。这在一般农村中本来是很平常的事情，但是，在这沟壑纵横、水土流失严重的苦寒干旱黄土山区，确实是稀罕的事情。武山县人民委员会驻邓家堡水土保持工作组的孔风忠同志一面陪我参观这个山村的新景象，一面谈起了它的沧桑史：
    邓家堡村座落在渭河南岸一个山腰上。它包括邓家堡、马家山、张家堡和黎家坪四个小村。二千多亩耕地差不多尽是零星小块的陡坡山地。这里的年雨量有一半集中在6、7、8月份。加上森林草坡早遭破坏，往往一场暴雨，满山泥水倾泻，把肥沃的土壤卷走，剩下硬硬的底板。年复一年，良田变成沟壑。1929年，这个不满百口人的小村子曾经饿死过三十七人，有五户逃荒在外。这就是1952年以前邓家堡的轮廓。
    今天，当我们在这里漫步的时候，虽然从崖脚下的土层上还可以看到水土流失的痕迹，但是崖坡上已经是一层层长满高粱和谷子的梯田了。差不多所有耕地的边沿都培起一道道整齐的地埂。地埂里面有的还套着软堰。从1952年到去年年底，已培地埂的耕地约占总耕地面积的97％（个别红粘土的地方不宜培地埂），基本上做到“地地有埂，埂埂相连”。软堰则是近年来的新创造。它和地埂一样，能拦水淤泥，独特之处是不占地。所以农民们说：“一亩地，三道堰，该收八斗收一担。”几年来的努力，使得多年来零星分割的山坡陡地大部分淤成了连片的平地。最大的一片达五十亩，小的也有七、八亩。这就是当地农民们所啧啧称道的“一稀罕”。
    土地连片给使用新式农具和其他的农业技术改革创造了条件。这就产生了邓家堡的“二稀罕”——夏田亩产四百斤。刚刚解放的时候，这个地方粮食的亩产量只有八十斤左右。邓家堡的二十五户居民中，有91％的人缺少四个月的口粮。全村只有三床棉被。几乎没有一个妇女能够穿上棉裤。现在呢？除两户劳力少，娃娃多的暂时还有点困难外，其余的人都已经是丰衣足食，有穿有戴，有铺有盖。去年全行政村四十四户共卖给国家余粮九千六百三十二斤。估计今年卖余粮的数字还要大大增加。曾经招待我们在他家里吃饭的青年农民邓耀清，一家四口人，两个劳动力，今年共做了四百五十个劳动日。平均每口人收入一千多斤粮食。几年来全村新盖了六十几间瓦房。
    主人边说边领着我继续爬了一段迂回曲折的盘山道。刚刚翻过一道梁，就看见一片黄灿灿的随风起伏的水稻的波浪。在这个高山苦旱的地方种水稻，这是一次大胆的尝试，一棵稻穗足有五、六寸长，我信手撷下一穗，数了一数，鼓鼓的颗粒足有一百四十多颗。据老庄稼汉的估计，这样的水稻一亩可以实收四百二十多斤米。旱地改水地，高产作物代替了低产作物，使这里产量迅速提高。目前邓家堡已经有水浇地六百多亩。
    “那末，水从哪里来呢？”
    想不到我问起水，竟引起了水土保持劳动模范、中共邓家堡分支部组织委员邓俊杰的无限感慨。他先给我讲了一番水的故事：
    搞水土保持以前的邓家堡，下雨时，房屋、良田被冲垮，耕牛家畜被淹死；可是一旦雨过天晴，全村又在为人畜饮水而发愁——吃水得到五、六里地以外去驮。那时候邓家堡的男人要娶外村的姑娘，就好比要娶天上的仙女一样。因为姑娘们不但害怕嫁到这个穷山村要挨饿，而且还害怕受渴。邓家代和林家庄林平喜的妹妹互相看上了，就是因为女方的父母嫌邓家堡缺水而使这对有情人终归没能成眷属。马来成老大爷因为受不过缺水的罪，全家搬到峡口落户去了。谈到这里，邓俊杰忽然笑着说：“这个八十几的老头儿今年又回来啦！”
    我们来到康家沟拦水坝的跟前。这条沟原来是邓家堡的一大祸害。1953年雨水甚至一口啃垮了陇海铁路的便道。以后人们在它的周围栽树种草，今年又拦腰筑了一座长三十八公尺、高十一公尺的土坝，形成了个碧绿清澈的人工湖。这里的水可以灌溉附近的三百五十亩地，一年可以增产二万八千斤粮食。
    来到桥子沟，我见识到另一种治理沟壑的办法。从前，桥子沟是这个山村的十几条大沟中的“罪魁”，后来人们在它的身上筑了七十八道插柳谷坊，阻滞山洪，拦蓄泥土。原来陡峭的沟底，今天已经淤成一块块平地。在这些地里种上草木樨，去年就收了四千八百斤。
    在西北高原，看到那些千疮百孔的未经治理的沟壑，真叫人着急，人们几时才能把那些残缺的土地改造好呢？看了这些新治理的沟壑，又觉得赤地变青山并不是渺茫的神话——桥子沟的巨大变化，前后才不过四、五年啊！
    邓家堡曾经在水土保持方针问题上走过弯路。1952年陇南水土保持工作组到邓家堡来开展工作的开始，曾产生了忽视田间工程、单纯在沟壑打坝的偏向。1953年全村打了六十七块坝，1954年增加到二百零四座。不料就在这一年的秋天，四小时下了六十七公厘的暴雨，人们辛辛苦苦搞了两、三年的土坝，90％都给冲垮了。那时，地里的高粱糜谷倒伏，马铃薯块根翻出土面。全村一片叹息声——多么沉痛的教训啊！
    今年6月5日，邓家堡又经历了一场较1954年更凶猛的暴雨——十分钟下了三十九公厘。然而邓家堡的土坝和庄稼都安然无恙。为什么呢？村青年团支部书记、出席过全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会的黎绪定笑着回答我：现在的土坝都是“钢筋水泥”筑成的！我懂得他的意思。他指的是现在的每一项水土保持工程都贯彻了全面治理的原则。
    1954年的那次大雨以后，工作组深入研究了打坝失败的原因，发现群众长期在同自然灾害斗争中，就积累了许多水土保持的经验。如邓家堡早就流传着这样的话：“水是一条龙，先从山顶行，治下不治上，万事一场空。”这说明水土保持必须坚持全面治理的方针。“涝池没大小，地点选择好”。这说明农民并不同意盲目修大工程。“平常（搞水土保持）不误农时，雨来全面突击，雨后比成绩”。这说明群众懂得合理支配农活和水土保持工作的时间。“梅花柱子连环夯，一调六夯三倒腔。”“培一层土，打一次夯，明年粮食增一半。”这说明农民是重视工程质量的。今年邓家堡的群众又创造性地在二十丈高的坡度的大红沟峭壁上用“刺路前进，借土点种”（把种子和泥土拌好，用锨子把它撒到峭壁上）的办法，种上了五亩地面积的草木樨。在分水岭上根据不同的地形，挖了五千个鱼鳞式、燕翅式和螺旋式的蓄水保土水平沟，种上了十万株簸箕柳。这种树，农民们管它叫摇钱树——到明年秋天，每株柳可以编两个簸箕。每个簸箕值七角五分钱。十万株柳的收入就是十五万元。依靠群众智慧，根据自然特点，经过全面规划，采取农、林、牧、水的综合措施，邓家堡的水土保持取得了显著的成绩。
    这个控制了水土流失占土地面积80％，基本上做到“水不下塬，土不下坡，泥不出沟，沙不漫地”的山村，几年来并没有接受国家投资，完全依靠群众的力量，使自己的生活环境和自然面貌迅速改变。
