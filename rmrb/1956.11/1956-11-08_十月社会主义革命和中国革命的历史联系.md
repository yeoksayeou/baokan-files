    The Historical Connection Between the October Socialist Revolution and the Chinese Revolution
    Song Qingling

    This year, in a few days, we will commemorate the ninetieth anniversary of the birth of Sun Yat-sen, the great revolutionary son of the Chinese people, and the thirty-ninth anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution. Our thoughts naturally turn to the historical connections between the Russian and Chinese revolutionary movements since the beginning of this century.

    In that era, capitalism ruled the world, although there were already signs that it was entering a period of decline. It was no longer progressive, as it massively intensified the exploitation of its own people and turned to super-exploiting the people of the East and Africa. It was a turbulent world, and capitalism was vainly attempting to save itself from its own contradictions.

    This was also the era when advanced Western ideas began to permeate the hearts of the people of the East. The light of nationalism and democracy awakened the intellectual circles, who now hoped to apply these ideas to their own countries. The people of these countries were filled with the desire to win freedom and equality for themselves. Although they faced incredible odds, they bravely began to take on the task of saving their nation.

    Russia and China at that time were similar in many ways. Imperialism had deeply penetrated the economic and political life of both countries. The countryside was suffocated by long-term, decaying feudalism, and the peasants suffered deeply. In science and culture, we were backward, and China was even more so. But in both Russia and China, there were people who saw this suffering and national shame and were determined to end it. In the process, they searched for revolutionary truths that could help them guide their countries out of ignorance.

    The most advanced of these revolutionaries was the great Lenin. By absorbing and developing the theories of Marx and Engels, he saw this struggle not only as a struggle for national self-determination but also as a struggle to liberate the people from the rule of capitalism. Most importantly, he saw that the only class that could lead this struggle to a victorious conclusion was the working class. In the extremely backward East, these views were not clear, and Lenin's powerful and insightful explanations later provided very great help in this regard.

    From the early stages of his revolutionary activities, Lenin was very concerned about the Chinese revolution. From 1900 onwards, especially in 1912 and 1913, he wrote some important articles on this issue. Having mastered the laws of social development, Lenin understood that the role of imperialism in China was like a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it oppressed the Chinese people, and on the other hand, it first educated and then inspired the best figures in China to fight for their freedom. He understood that the spontaneous uprisings of peasants against feudalism would join with the anti-imperialist struggles of the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie with nationalist ideas in the cities, merging into an organized force for liberation. He wrote that the old-style riots in China "will inevitably advance into a conscious democratic movement." (Lenin: "Inflammable Material in World Politics" - 1908) It was at this time that Sun Yat-sen carried out his revolutionary organizational activities and encountered initial setbacks in the movement to overthrow the corrupt Qing Dynasty.

    There are no records of whether Lenin had any contact with Sun Yat-sen in these early years, and it is likely that there was no contact at that time. As Lenin pointed out in 1912: "... Chinese democracy... which has already obtained a republican system... is completely unrelated to Russia, to Russian experience, and to Russian writings." (Lenin: "Democracy and Populism in China" - 1912)

    Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary ideas and actions first attracted Lenin's attention after the 1911 Revolution. The possibility of hundreds of millions of Chinese people participating in the democratic movement was a highly significant event for Lenin. Therefore, he carefully studied the revolutionary program formulated by Sun Yat-sen, especially his solution to the Chinese peasant problem, because at that time it had a decisive force on the success or failure of the revolution, and the Chinese peasants at that time were a decisive force sufficient to determine the future of the revolution.

    In his article "Democracy and Populism in China," Lenin evaluated the program outlined by Sun Yat-sen in his article "The Social Significance of the Chinese Revolution" published in the Belgian socialist newspaper "Le Peuple." Lenin highly praised Sun Yat-sen's spirit. He wrote: "Militant and genuine democracy permeates every line of Sun Yat-sen's program"; and said: "(This program) directly raises the questions of the masses' living conditions and the masses' struggle, warmly sympathizes with the laborers and the exploited, and believes in their honesty and their strength."

    However, Lenin also made a profound analysis of this program, pointing out that, in essence, it required the implementation of "... socialist dreams..." and "... radical land reform plans and propaganda combined with" a bourgeois democratic revolution. Lenin explained that Sun Yat-sen's "economic revolution" was a "purely capitalist, maximum capitalist land program," a plan for land nationalization that would inevitably promote "the most rapid development of capitalism in agriculture." He also pointed out that Sun Yat-sen's socialism was "subjective socialism" because his program called for "merely eliminating feudal exploitation," although Sun Yat-sen revealed in his article the suffering of the working masses in capitalist countries that he had witnessed and called on the Chinese people to strive from the beginning to oppose the establishment of capitalism in China. This was a contradiction in his thinking that Sun Yat-sen was only able to clarify later.

    In the above analysis, Lenin also clearly predicted Yuan Shikai's betrayal and the future of the Chinese revolution. He wrote that China's industrialization would inevitably produce a proletariat with its own political party, which, while criticizing Sun Yat-sen's incorrect views, "will carefully select, protect, and develop the revolutionary-democratic core of his political and land program." This is exactly what happened when the Chinese Communist Party was founded about nine years later.

    We know that it was precisely the forces pointed out by Lenin, namely the warlords supported by imperialism, that undermined the 1911 Revolution. However, he also predicted that things would not end there. In 1913, he wrote: "No matter what the fate of the great Chinese Republic, which the 'civilized' jackals are sharpening their teeth to devour, no force in the world can restore the old serf system in Asia, can eradicate the heroic democratic spirit of the masses of people in Asian and semi-Asian countries." (Lenin: "The Historical Destiny of the Doctrine of Marx" - 1913) This assessment of the situation was also accurate. Sun Yat-sen, despite suffering many failures and setbacks, continued to reflect the revolutionary enthusiasm of the Chinese masses and dedicated his life to the struggle for China's freedom and equality.

    The world situation was constantly developing. The First World War showed that the capitalist system was in turmoil. As a result of this war, the October Socialist Revolution broke out, and the first socialist country in world history was established. These two major events further shook the foundations of imperialist capitalism.

    For the people of the East, a new chapter unfolded in their struggle for freedom. As Chairman Mao Zedong wrote: "The great revolutionary energy of the Russian proletariat and working people, which had been hidden underground and invisible to foreigners in the past... suddenly erupted like a volcano. The Chinese people and all of mankind looked at the Russian people with new eyes." "The salvoes of the October Revolution brought us Marxism-Leninism." (Mao Zedong: "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship" - 1949)

    At this time, Lenin's powerful ideas were able to have a direct impact on the Chinese revolution for the first time. During the period of 1918-1920, even though the Russian Revolution was in a critical period, Lenin was still able to spare no time and energy to study the various problems faced by the revolutionaries in the East.

    In November 1919, Lenin gave a report at the Second All-Russia Congress of Communist Organizations of the Peoples of the East. In this report, he put forward the tasks of those who were striving for freedom and progress for their nations. He straightforwardly clarified the direction they should take.

    He wrote: "Before you lies a task that has never been presented to Communists around the world: you must rely on the general theory and practice of Communism, and be good at assessing the special circumstances that do not exist in European countries, and apply this theory and practice to the local conditions, where the main masses are peasants, and where the task to be solved is not opposition to capital but opposition to the remnants of the Middle Ages."

    Speaking of practical issues, he wrote: "You cannot find the solutions to these tasks in any Communist books, but you can find the solutions to these tasks in the common struggle that has been started by Russia. You must raise this task and solve this task based on your own experience."

    At the Second Congress of the Communist International in July 1920, Lenin gave another special report on national and colonial questions. In that report, he clarified that the national movement had a bourgeois democratic nature. This is because most of the people in backward countries are peasants who represent bourgeois-capitalist relations. But he also pointed out that as long as this nationalist revolutionary movement does not hinder the organization of peasants and the broad masses of the exploited, and does not hinder them from accepting revolutionary education, this movement should be supported, but in supporting this movement, it is necessary to both cooperate and struggle with the national bourgeoisie. He warned that a clear distinction should be made between this movement and the reformist movement, because the latter only serves the interests of the imperialists.

    These classic documents, as well as other writings by Lenin, had a huge impact in China. In the early years of the Chinese Communist Party and in later years, these writings became the basis for many theories about the Chinese revolution. It was precisely by relying on Lenin's wisdom that the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong applied the general theory and practice of communism in the specific circumstances of China, thus developing these basic principles into the theory and practice of the Chinese revolution. Because of the success of our revolution, Lenin's thought, coupled with Mao Zedong Thought and the experience of the Chinese Communist Party, has further inspired hundreds of millions of people in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, thereby immeasurably strengthening the unity of the world's working class and the general struggle against imperialism.

    Sun Yat-sen sympathized with the Russian Revolution very early on and closely watched its progress. He was overjoyed when he heard the news of the success of the Russian Revolution, and in 1918, he sent a telegram to Lenin congratulating him on this great victory. He knew that this would definitely have repercussions in China. As he later said, the Russian Revolution "... set an example for China, showing how a nation can liberate itself from foreign oppression and the shackles of injustice." (Interview published in the English "Canton Gazette" in September 1924)

    Sun Yat-sen greatly valued the lessons of the October Socialist Revolution. With the help of the Chinese Communist Party, he turned these lessons into action, revised his revolutionary program, and revived the Kuomintang. He embarked on his last revolutionary movement with renewed energy.

    In 1922, the first direct contact was established between Lenin and Sun Yat-sen. In their correspondence, these two great revolutionary fighters joined hands in the struggle for human freedom and progress. Unfortunately, these letters were burned in the fire that destroyed the Presidential Palace during Chen Jiongming's rebellion in Guangzhou in June of that year.

    Sun Yat-sen was very optimistic about the possibility of revolutionary success at this time. Not only had he found the main key to success expressed in his Three Principles of the People, but he knew that he had the full support of the Soviet people and their government. He welcomed the practical assistance given to his Guangzhou government. He was very grateful for the support given by the Soviet newspapers, trade unions, and public opinion. Their cry of "Hands off China!" was a warning to all imperialists and a battle cry practiced by workers and laborers all over the world.

    In 1923, the first diplomatic representative of the Soviet Union arrived in Beijing to negotiate the relations between our two countries. He immediately telegraphed Sun Yat-sen in Guangzhou, greeting him as an old friend of Soviet Russia and asking him to "... help realize the great task of establishing the closest relations between the Chinese and Russian peoples, which is the greatest guarantee of their free and peaceful development."

    In his reply, Sun Yat-sen said that he was deeply moved by this high regard for his friendship with the new Russia, and he reiterated his determination to resist imperialism together with it. He praised the position taken by Soviet Russia in its negotiations with the incompetent Beiyang government controlled by imperialism. He wrote: They "... thought that your Soviet government was imitating the United States, and you sternly rebuked them and declared that Russia would never imitate the precedent of the United States... Russia does not demand extraterritoriality or extraterritoriality clauses, nor does it demand the establishment of courts in Chinese territory. Russia abolishes any concessions and privileges that undermine the sovereignty and interests of the Chinese people. Russia has established the principle of complete and absolute equality in its relations with China. I hereby express my gratitude and praise in the name of the Chinese people for the unforgettable lesson in political realism that you have given to the submissive servants of the current masters in Beijing."

    It must be remembered that it was at this time that the imperialist countries used every imaginable means to torment and attack Sun Yat-sen, to prevent the Chinese revolution. This only made him praise the Soviet policy towards China in even more fervent words of gratitude.

    Soon after, the high tide of the Chinese revolution arrived, but it was greatly diminished due to two major losses. In a little over a year, both Lenin and Sun Yat-sen passed away, thus interrupting what would undoubtedly have been a close and fruitful relationship. However, the cause that Lenin and Sun Yat-sen wanted to realize in Russia and China was taken over by others and finally completed. The names of these two outstanding revolutionary fighters will be immortalized because they stood up for the ideals that inspired the working people of both countries and the world. The revolutionary banner that they had always held high in any offensive was only lowered for a moment to commemorate them, and then it was raised at the forefront of the people's great advance in the struggle for freedom, equality, and socialism. Their cause cannot be denied. Its victory in Russia and China was inevitable. Its victory throughout the world is certain.

    Today, the friendship between the people of our two countries is precisely built on this historical connection between the great Chinese Revolution and the Russian Revolution. In these thirty-nine years, we Chinese people have commemorated the great October Socialist Revolution every year, willing to dedicate ourselves to its rich revolutionary heritage. Today, in the midst of the glorious task of building socialism in our country, we all look back at this heritage and see around us the selfless fraternal assistance of the Soviet Union. All of this inspires us to overcome all kinds of difficulties and move forward rapidly in the struggle to create a new China and a new world.

    Salute to the great Soviet country!
    Salute to the great people of the Soviet Union!
    Salute to the unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples!

    十月社会主义革命和中国革命的历史联系
    宋庆龄
    今年，在几天之内，我们就要纪念中国人民伟大的革命儿子孙中山诞辰九十周年和伟大的十月社会主义革命三十九周年。我们的思想就自然而然地转到本世纪以来俄国革命运动和中国革命运动之间的历史联系。
    在那个时代，资本主义统治着全世界，虽然当时已经有迹象表明它已经进入了走下坡路的阶段。它已经不再是进步的了，因为它大规模地加紧对本国人民的剥削，并且已经转而对东方和非洲各国人民实行超级剥削。那是一个动荡的世界，资本主义则徒劳地企图把自己从本身的矛盾中拯救出来。
    这也是西方的先进思想开始渗入东方各国人民的心灵的时代。民族主义和民主的光芒唤醒了知识界，他们现在希望把这些思想应用于自己的国家。这些国家的人民满怀着为自己赢得自由和平等的愿望。虽然他们面临着难于置信的优势，但是他们开始勇敢地担负起拯救自己的民族的任务。
    那时的俄国和中国在许多方面是相像的。帝国主义深深地侵入了两个国家的经济和政治生活。乡村被长期的腐朽的封建主义压得喘不过气来，农民受着深重的苦难。在科学和文化方面，我们是落后的，而中国甚至更落后。但是在俄国和中国都有看到这种苦难和民族耻辱并且决心结束这种情况的人，在这个过程中，他们寻找着能够帮助他们引导自己的国家脱离蒙昧的革命真理。
    这些革命者中最先进的人是伟大的列宁。由于吸收了和发展了马克思和恩格斯的学说，他把这个斗争不仅看作争取民族自决权的斗争，而且看作把人民从资本主义的统治下解放出来的斗争。最主要的是，他看到能够把这个斗争引向胜利的结局的唯一阶级是工人阶级。在极端落后的东方，这些观点还不是清楚的，是列宁的有力的透辟的阐释后来在这一方面提供了非常大的帮助。
    列宁从他的革命活动的早期起就非常关心中国的革命。从1900年起，特别是在1912年和1913年，他在这个问题上写了一些重要的文章。掌握了社会发展规律的列宁懂得，帝国主义在中国所起的作用就好像是一把双刃的刀。一方面是压迫中国人民，而另一方面则是先教育了、然后激发起中国最优秀的人物为自己的自由进行斗争。他懂得，农民反抗封建主义的自发起义会同有着民族主义思想的资产阶级和小资产阶级在城市中进行的反对帝国主义的斗争接合起来，汇合成为一支有组织的争取解放的力量。他写道：中国旧式的暴乱“必然会进为有觉悟的民主运动。”（列宁：“世界政治上的引火物”——1908年）正是在这个时候，孙中山进行了他的革命的组织活动，并且在推翻腐朽的清朝的活动中遭遇到最初的失败。
    关于在这些早期的年代里列宁是否同孙中山进行过什么接触，现在没有记载，那时大概不曾有过什么接触。正如列宁在1912年所指出的：“……已经获得了共和政体的……中国民主主义……——与俄国、与俄国经验、与俄国著作完全无关。”（列宁：“中国的民主主义与民粹主义”——1912）
    孙中山的革命思想和革命行动最初引起列宁注意是在1911年革命以后。中国亿万人民参加民主运动队伍的可能性对列宁说来是一项具有极大意义的事件。因此，他仔细研究了孙中山拟定的革命纲领，特别是他的解决中国农民问题的办法，因为那时对于革命的成败有决定性的力量，中国农民在当时是足以决定革命前途的决定性力量。
    列宁在他的“中国的民主主义与民粹主义”一文中评价了孙中山在比利时社会党报纸“人民报”发表的“中国革命底社会意义”一文中所概述的纲领。列宁十分赞扬孙中山的精神。他写道：“战斗的真实的民主主义渗透着孙逸仙政纲底每一行”；并说：“（这个政纲）直接提出群众生活状况、群众斗争的问题，热烈地同情劳动者和被剥削者，相信他们的正直与他们的力量。”
    但是，列宁也对这个政纲作了深刻的分析，他指出，实质上，它要求实行“……与社会主义的梦想……”和“……激进的土地改革底计划和宣传结合在一起的”资产阶级民主革命。列宁解释，孙中山的“经济革命”为“纯粹资本主义的、最大限度资本主义的土地纲领”，一个必定会促进“农业中资本主义底最迅速的发展”的土地国有化计划。他还指出，孙中山的社会主义是“主观社会主义”，因为他的纲领要求的是“仅仅消灭封建剥削”，尽管孙中山在他的文章中揭露了他亲眼看见的资本主义国家中劳动群众所受的苦难，并且号召中国人民从一开头，就努力反对在中国建立资本主义。这是孙中山到后来才能够弄清楚的他的思想中的一个矛盾。
    在上述分析中，列宁还明确地预言了袁世凯的背叛和中国革命的前途。他写到中国的工业化必然会产生拥有自己的政党的无产阶级，这个党在批判孙中山的不正确观点的同时，“一定会细心地选择、保护和发展他的政治纲领和土地纲领底革命——民主主义的核心”。这正是大约九年以后中国共产党成立的时候所发生的情况。
    我们知道，破坏1911年的革命的正是列宁所指明的势力，即帝国主义支持的军阀。但是，他也预言，事情不会就这样完了。在1913年，他写道：“不管那些‘文明’豺狼磨牙欲噬的伟大中华民国命运如何，但世界上决没有一种力量能在亚洲恢复旧有的农奴制度，能铲除亚洲国家和半亚洲国家里人民大众底英勇民主精神。”（列宁：“马克思学说底历史命运”——1913）对事情的这种估计也是准确的，孙中山尽管遭受了许多失败和挫折，还是继续反映中国群众的革命热情，并且把毕生的力量献给争取中国的自由平等的斗争。
    世界的局势不停地发展。第一次世界大战表明资本主义制度处于动荡之中。这次大战的结果，爆发了十月社会主义革命，建立了世界历史上第一个社会主义国家。这两个重大事件进一步动摇了帝国主义资本主义的基础。
    对东方各国人民来说，在他们争取自由的斗争中展开了崭新的一章。正如毛泽东主席所写的：“过去蕴藏在地下为外国人所看不见的伟大的俄国无产阶级及劳动人民的革命精力……像火山一样突然爆发出来了。中国人和全人类对俄国人都另眼相看了”。“十月革命一声炮响，给我们送来了马克思列宁主义。”（毛泽东：“论人民民主专政”——1949年）
    这个时候，强有力的列宁思想第一次能够对中国革命发生直接影响了。在1918—1920年期间，虽然俄国革命正在紧急的时期，列宁还能够不惜时间和精力来研究东方革命者们面临的种种问题。
    1919年11月，列宁在东方各族人民共产主义组织第二次全俄代表大会上作了一个报告。他在这篇报告中提出了那些为自己的民族争取自由和进步的人们的任务。他直截了当地阐明了他们应当走的方向。
    他写道：“在你们面前摆着一个从未在全世界共产主义者面前摆过的任务：你们必须依靠一般共产主义的理论和实践，要善于估计到欧洲各国所没有的特殊情况，把这理论和实践运用到当地的情况中去，那里主要的群众是农民，那里必须解决的不是反对资本而是反对中世纪残余的任务。”
    他在谈到实际问题时写道：“这些任务的解决方法，你们在任何哪一部共产主义书本里都是找不到的，但这些任务的解决方法你们是能在已由俄国开始了的共同的斗争中找到的。你们必须提出这个任务，并凭靠自己的经验来解决这个任务。”
    在1920年7月共产国际第二次代表大会上，列宁又作了一次关于民族和殖民地问题的特别报告。他在那次报告中阐明了民族运动带有资产阶级民主性质。这一点，因为落后国家中的大部分人民是代表资产阶级——资本主义关系的农民。但是他也指出，只要这种民族主义革命运动不妨碍把农民和广大被剥削群众组织起来，不妨碍他们接受革命精神的教育，就要支持这种运动，但是在支持这种运动时，要既与民族资产阶级合作又与他们进行斗争。他警告说，应该明确分清这种运动和改良主义运动之间的区别，因为后者是只为帝国主义者的利益服务的。
    这些经典的文件以及列宁所写的其他著作，在中国产生了巨大的影响。在中国共产党的早期以及后来的年代里，这些著作成为关于中国革命中的许多理论的基础。正是由于凭借列宁的智慧，中国共产党和毛泽东主席把共产主义的一般理论和实践运用到中国的具体情况，从而把这些基本的原则发展成为中国革命的理论和实践。由于我国革命的成功，列宁的思想加上毛泽东思想和中国共产党的经验，已经进一步鼓舞了亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各地亿万人民，从而无可估量地加强了世界工人阶级的团结和对帝国主义普遍的斗争。
    孙中山很早就同情俄国革命，并且密切地注视着它的进展。他在听到俄国革命成功的消息时高兴到了极点，在1918年，他拍给列宁一个电报，祝贺这个伟大的胜利。他知道，这必定会在中国产生反响。正如他后来所说的，俄国革命“……为中国树立了一个榜样，说明一个民族怎样从外国压迫和不公正的桎梏下解放出来。”（1924年9月英文“广州日报”发表的访问记）
    孙中山十分珍视十月社会主义革命的教训。在中国共产党的帮助下，他把这些教训变成了行动，修改了他的革命纲领，复兴了国民党。他以新的精力着手进行他最后一次的革命运动。
    在1922年，列宁和孙中山之间第一次建立了直接的联系。在通信往来当中，这两位伟大的革命战士在争取人类自由和进步的斗争中携起了手来，可惜的是，这些信件在那年6月陈炯明广州叛乱中火烧总统府的时候被焚毁了。
    孙中山这时对于革命成功的可能性是非常乐观的。他不仅找到了表现在他的三民主义中的成功的主要关键，而且他知道他有苏联人民和他们的政府的充分支持。他欢迎给与他的广州政府的实际帮助。他十分感谢苏联报纸、工会和广大舆论所给与的支持。它们喊出的“不许干涉中国！”的呼声是对一切帝国主义者的一个警告，也是全世界的工人和劳动者所实行的战斗口号。
    在1923年，苏联的第一个外交代表到达北京，来谈判我们两国的关系问题。他立即打电报给在广州的孙中山，向他致意，称他为苏俄的老朋友，并且要求他“……帮助实现使中国人民和俄国人民建立最密切的关系的伟大任务，那是它们自由的和平的发展的最大保证”。
    孙中山在复信中说，对于这样看重他对新俄国的友谊，他深为感动，他重申同它一道反抗帝国主义的决心。他盛赞苏俄在同帝国主义把持的无能的北洋政府的谈判中所采取的立场。他写道：他们“……以为你们苏维埃的政府是模仿美国的，你们严词斥责了他们并且宣称俄国决不仿效美国的先例……俄国绝不要求治外法权和治外法权条款，也不要求在中国的领土建立法庭。俄国废除任何有损中国人民主权和利益的让步和特权。俄国在它同中国的关系上建立了完全和绝对平等的原则。我谨以中国人民的名义向你表示感谢和称许，因为你给予了目前北京的主人们的顺从奴仆以这一政治现实主义的难忘一课。”
    必须记得，正是在这个时候，帝国主义国家使用想像得到的一切办法来磨难和打击孙中山，来阻止中国革命。这只有使他用更热情的感谢的话来赞扬苏联对中国的政策。
    不久之后，中国革命的高潮来到了，但是因为两大损失而大为逊色。在一年多一点的时间里，列宁和孙中山都去世了，这样一来，就中断了本来无疑会是密切的和富有成果的关系。但是，列宁和孙中山要在俄国和中国实现的事业由其他的人接过手来，并且终于完成了。这两位杰出的革命战士的名字永垂不朽，因为他们曾经为了鼓舞这两个国家和全世界的劳动人民的那些理想挺身奋斗。他们在任何进攻中都一直高举着的革命旗帜只是为了纪念他们而暂时下降了片刻，然后就举在为自由、平等和社会主义斗争的大步前进的人民的前列。他们事业是不能否认的。它在俄国和中国取得胜利是不可避免的。它在全世界取得胜利是一定的。
    今天我们两国人民的友谊正是建筑在伟大的中国革命和俄国革命之间的这种历史联系上的。在这三十九年里面，我们中国人民每年都纪念伟大的十月社会主义革命，愿为它的丰富的革命遗产献身。今天，在我国建设社会主义的光荣任务的中途，我们都回顾这笔遗产，看到在我们周围的是苏联的无私的兄弟的援助。这一切鼓舞我们在创造新中国和新世界的奋斗中去克服各种各样的困难，迅速地前进。
    向伟大的苏维埃国家致敬！
    向伟大的苏联各族人民致敬！
    向中国人民和苏联人民的牢不可破的友谊致敬！
