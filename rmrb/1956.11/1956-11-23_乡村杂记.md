Rural Jottings
    A Wild Ditch
    Rather Rot Than Anything Else
    Every time I pass the newly built small road next to what is now the township supply and marketing cooperative – formerly the Yu Gong Ancestral Hall, the ancestral hall of Yu Qian of the Ming Dynasty – I see five or six stacks, hundreds of stacks, of bamboo baskets neatly piled up beside the road. These were left behind in the spring of this year when the Hangzhou Construction Bureau's Lake Mud Brigade – who were dredging the West Lake mud – left.

    Thousands of bamboo baskets have been placed there from spring to summer, from summer to autumn, always neatly stacked, not a single one missing. The members of the West Lake Agricultural Production Cooperative in this area all understand: these are public property, and no one will touch them; even if there were Renminbi all over the ground, no one would "improperly obtain wealth" now. If it doesn't belong to them, who would move it? Thus, thousands of bamboo baskets are able to leisurely enjoy the wind, rain, and sun, waiting to slowly rot away.

    Are these bamboo baskets needed by the agricultural production cooperative? They are very much needed, and very useful, but watching useful things turn into waste.

    Every early spring, during the rush to add greenery, workers from the Hangzhou Construction Bureau's Landscaping Administration help farmers in the suburbs cut thatch. The Landscaping Administration stipulates that this thatch be divided between the workers and the farmers. For the past year or two, the thatch allocated to the Landscaping Administration workers has not been used – I don't know why – and 50,000 to 60,000 jin of thatch are piled up in the open air, some of which has already rotted, and some of which is still rotting. This rotten and rotting thatch can no longer be used as firewood, and can only be burned into ash as fertilizer, yet even this suggestion, the farmers don't know why they haven't made it.

    In order to build Hangzhou into a beautiful large park, the Hangzhou Construction Bureau often encloses large areas of land cultivated by farmers, and the farmers have no objection to this. What the farmers find strange is that these urgent orders are like shooting stars. As soon as the land is enclosed, no construction is seen, turning large tracts of fertile land into barren mountains! Thus, a struggle between fertile land and barren mountains, which can be said to be an internal matter of the people, unfolds!

    Farmers saw that the 40 mu of land at Jionglonggang, which had been enclosed, was not being developed and was left barren, so they asked to cultivate it. The Construction Bureau refused, saying that construction would begin soon, and the farmers had to return. After a few days, construction still did not begin, so the farmers secretly planted early rice, and in July harvested four or five hundred jin per mu. More than 40 mu of land at Shifoter Tan was also enclosed, but the farmers did not dare to steal and plant, and it is still a barren mountain to this day.

    When the Construction Bureau came to enclose the land at Yufenban, rice was growing in the fields, and the rice had already formed ears. The farmers requested that land elsewhere be requisitioned first, and that the rice at Yufenban be harvested before enclosing it, but this was not allowed. The farmers were forced to cut down all the surrounding field ridges, and were given 40 or 50 yuan per mu as compensation for the green seedlings. The farmers took the Renminbi, but they were still not happy. The farmers felt that the state was constantly calling for cherishing grain, and that grain was the most precious of treasures, which was completely correct, and they still hoped to keep the rice until harvest, not wanting the green seedling compensation fee. They disagreed with immediate requisition but were still immediately requisitioned. But until now, Yufenban has still not been used. Now, the rice can be harvested, and the Construction Bureau is calling the farmers and saying: In order to support agricultural production cooperatives, they are willing to let the farmers harvest the rice in the fields of Yufenban, and the farmers have to pay fifteen yuan per mu. In fact, the farmers understand very well that this is only because construction cannot currently begin in the Liuzhuang area to dig lake mud, so Yufenban is not useful – the fields of Yufenban are used to store lake mud – and it is not really to support agricultural production cooperatives.

      "To build a socialist countryside, this kind of work style must be changed!" Comrades in the township and cooperative often say to me.

    宁愿烂掉及其它
    每次走过现在作为乡供销合作社——过去是于公祠，明于谦的祠堂——旁边的一条新建小路，就看见小路旁整齐地堆放着五、六只一叠，成百叠的竹筐，这是在今年春天，杭州市建设局的湖泥大队——挑那挖起来的西湖湖泥——走时所留下的东西。
    成千只竹筐从春天放到夏天，夏天放到秋天，总是那样整齐地放着，一只也不少。这一带的西湖农业生产合作社的社员们都明白：这是公家的东西，没有人去碰一碰手指；即使满地是人民币，现在谁也是“临财不苟得”的，不是属于自己的，谁会去动呢。这样，成千只竹筐得以从容自在地在那里尝受着风吹、雨打、日晒，等待着慢慢的烂掉。
    这些竹筐对农业生产合作社说来是不是需要呢？很需要，也很有用处，但是眼看有用的东西就要成为废物。
    每年初春，在突击绿化的时候，杭州建设局园林管理处的工人帮助郊区农民割茅柴，园林管理处规定，这些茅柴由工人和农民分。一、两年来，园林管理处工人所分得的茅柴一直没有使用掉——不知为什么——，五、六万斤茅柴堆积在露天，有的已经烂掉，有的还正在烂。这些已烂和正在烂的茅柴不能再当柴火使用了，只能把它烧成灰，作为肥料，然而就是连这个建议，农民也不知怎么没有提出。
    为了把杭州建设成一个美丽的大公园，杭州建设局经常圈去大片大片农民所耕种的土地，对于这，农民是没有意见的。农民奇怪的是这些逼得急如星火的命令，土地立刻圈去之后，却又并不见从事建设，使大片大片的良田，变成了荒山！就这样，展开了一场说来是人民内部的良田和荒山的斗争！
    农民看见被圈去的迥龙港四十亩田，并没有建设，荒在那里，于是，就去请求耕种，建设局不许，说马上就要建设，农民只得回来；过了些日子，还是不见动工建设，农民便偷偷地去种上了早稻，到7月里收了四、五百斤一亩。石佛儿潭也有被圈去的四十多亩田，农民没有敢去偷种，那里，到现在仍是一片荒山。
    建设局来圈于坟坂的田时，于坟坂的田里正长着稻子，稻已结穗，农民请求先征用别处的田，让于坟坂的稻子收割起再圈，可是不准许，硬要农民把四周的田埂统统割掉，给农民四、五十元一亩的青苗费作为贴补。农民拿了人民币，心里还是不快活。农民觉得国家经常在号召珍视粮食，粮食是宝中之宝，这完全是正确的，还是希望把稻留到收割，不要青苗赔偿费，不同意立刻征用而仍被立刻征用了。可是到现在，于坟坂仍旧没有使用，现在呢，稻可以割了，建设局叫农民去，说：为了支援农业生产合作社，愿意让农民去收割于坟坂田里的稻子，要农民拿出十五元一亩。其实，农民心里很明白，只是因为目前在刘庄那段地带不能动工挖湖泥，于坟坂也就派不上用途——于坟坂的田是用以积湖泥的——并不是什么为了支援农业生产合作社。
      “为了建设社会主义农村，这样一类的作风不能不改变呀！”乡里和社里的同志们经常对我说。
