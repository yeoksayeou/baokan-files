Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, November 27th: The Japanese House of Representatives today unanimously approved the Japan-Soviet Joint Declaration, the Japan-Soviet Protocol on the Development of Trade and Reciprocal Most-Favored-Nation Treatment, the Japan-Soviet Fisheries Treaty, and the Japan-Soviet Maritime Rescue Agreement. Immediately after approving these four bills, the House of Representatives sent them to the House of Councillors for deliberation.

Members of the Yoshida faction and others within the ruling Liberal Democratic Party who opposed the ratification of these documents refused to attend the meeting today.

Japanese Foreign Minister Mamoru Shigemitsu said at a press conference today that he hoped to exchange instruments of ratification with the Soviet Union around December 10th. He expressed his belief that, with the support of the opposition parties, the Japan-Soviet Joint Declaration and other bills would be approved by the Diet as desired.
