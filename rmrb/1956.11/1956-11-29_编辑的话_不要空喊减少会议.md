    Don't Just Shout About Reducing Meetings
    From the two articles "Meetings Constantly Held, Hotels Always Full" and "Give More Concrete Help to Township Cadres," we can see how much loss excessive, large, and long meetings have brought us. In many places, these meetings have become a disaster due to their excessive frequency, size, and duration. However, despite this, some leading organs simply cannot reduce meetings. Because, some people resolutely oppose higher authorities holding many meetings, but they themselves call their subordinates to meetings at the slightest provocation; some people often criticize others for liking to hold large meetings, but when they attend certain meetings, they insist on bringing a large number of followers... In reality, can meetings really not be reduced? The practice of the Wanquan County Party Committee is a very good answer. The problem is, don't just clamor about opposing holding too many meetings, but start with yourself and begin to streamline meetings!

    不要空喊减少会议
    从“会议不断开，旅馆人常满”和“多给乡干部具体帮助”两篇文章中可以看出，过多的过大的和过长的会议，已经给我们带来多大的损失，在不少地方，由于它的太多太大太长，这些会议简直形成一种灾难。可是，尽管如此，有些领导机关的会议却硬是不能减少。因为，有些人坚决地反对上边多开会，可是他自己却又动不动就召集他的下级开会；有些人常常批评别人爱开大会，可是自己出席某些会议时却又非带大批随从不可……。实际上，会议是不是真就不能减少呢？万全县委的做法就是一个很好的回答。问题在于，不要只是吵嚷着反对多开会，而要首先从自己开始，下手精简会议！
