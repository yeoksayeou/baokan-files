    Mr. Lu Xun often revealed in casual conversations that he would not ask those close to him to take risks; he feared seeing those he cared for bleed, and he would not lead troops. He believed that Mr. Sun Yat-sen had clear reason and firm will, and could lead revolutionaries to fight; therefore, he respected Mr. Sun Yat-sen. Although Mr. Lu Xun was very disappointed with the Xinhai Revolution, and there are many descriptions in "A Call to Arms" lamenting the failure of the Xinhai Revolution; he valued the Xinhai Revolution very much. In 1920, he said in "The Story of Hair," "They have forgotten to commemorate, and the commemoration has forgotten them!" Because on the "Double Tenth Festival" commemorating the Xinhai Revolution, there was not even a record of it on the calendar.

    Mr. Lu Xun respected Mr. Sun Yat-sen, because, as he said in "The First Anniversary of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's Death," "Mr. Sun Yat-sen's life history is complete; standing in the world is revolution, and failure is still revolution; after the establishment of the Republic of China, he was never satisfied, never at ease, and continued to advance towards a nearly complete revolutionary work. Until the moment of his death, he said: The revolution has not yet succeeded, comrades must still work hard!"

    Mr. Sun Yat-sen "took Russia as a teacher"; his Three Great Policies were alliance with Russia, alliance with the Communist Party, and emphasis on peasants and workers. Mr. Lu Xun respected Mr. Sun Yat-sen for valuing revolution; believing that a failed revolution is still a revolution, Mr. Lu Xun understood the complexity and arduousness of revolution. Only in this way could he appreciate that even a failed revolution is still valuable, and only then could he resiliently persevere in the long-term revolution.

    I remember when Mr. Sun Yat-sen had just passed away, newspapers speaking for the warlord government published the headline "Sun Dapao [Sun the Cannon, a derogatory nickname] Doesn't Fire Anymore" in large font. At that time, public opinion, while those opposing the revolution naturally ridiculed him in every possible way; even those who did not oppose the revolution casually satirized him because they did not understand the complexity and arduousness of the revolution. Mr. Lu Xun was very indignant at this situation, and he specially wrote "Warriors and Flies" to denounce it: "When a warrior dies in battle, what flies first discover are his shortcomings and scars, sucking on them, buzzing, thinking they are triumphant, thinking they are more heroic than the dead warrior. But the warrior has already died in battle, and will not come to wave them away. So the flies buzz even more, thinking that their voice is immortal. … However, a warrior with shortcomings is still a warrior, and a perfect fly is still just a fly." (Hua Gai Collection)

    Mr. Sun Yat-sen was indeed great, and he was admired by the general youth of the time. I remember that the first book I bought when I arrived in Shanghai was the booklet "Sun Wen's Theory". I once squeezed into the crowd in "Central Park" to pay my respects to his remains. People from all walks of life came to the funeral, and the procession was unprecedentedly large, orderly, and solemn. I followed all the way to Biyun Temple. I was just one of the general youth at the time. We were very angry when we heard words and writings that insulted Mr. Sun Yat-sen, and Mr. Lu Xun's "Warriors and Flies" said what we wanted to say.

    鲁迅先生和孙中山先生
    钦文
    鲁迅先生时常在闲谈中流露这样的意思，就是他不会叫同他亲近的人去冒险；怕见要好的人流血，他不会带兵。他认为孙中山先生有分明的理智和坚定的意志，能够带领革命者作战；因此他尊重孙中山先生。鲁迅先生虽然对于辛亥革命很感失望，在“呐喊”上有着许多为着辛亥革命失败而慨叹的描写；可是他很重视辛亥革命。他于1920年在“头发的故事”中说，“他们忘却了纪念，纪念也忘却了他们！”因为在纪念辛亥革命的“双十节”，连日历上都没有一点纪载。
    鲁迅先生尊重孙中山先生，因为像他在“中山先生逝世后一周年”上说的，“中山先生的一生历史具在，站出世间来就是革命，失败了还是革命；中华民国成立之后，也没有满足过，没有安逸过，仍然继续着进向近于完全的革命的工作。直到临终之际，他说道：革命尚未成功，同志仍须努力！”
    孙中山先生“以俄为师”；他的三大政策，就是联俄、联共和重视农民和工人。鲁迅先生为着重视革命而尊重孙中山先生；认为失败了的革命仍然是革命，鲁迅先生是了解了革命的复杂性和艰巨性的。像他这样，才能够体会到，即使是失败了的革命也仍然是可贵的，也才能够韧性地坚持长期的革命。
      记得孙中山先生刚逝世时，替军阀政府说话的报纸，用大号字刊登“孙大炮放不响了”的标题。当时舆论，反对革命的固然多方嘲笑；并不反对革命的，也因为不了解革命的复杂性和艰巨性而随便加以讽刺。鲁迅先生对于这种情况非常愤恨，他特地写了“战士和苍蝇”来痛斥：“战士战死了的时候，苍蝇们所首先发见的是他的缺点和伤痕，嘬着，营营地叫着，以为得意，以为比死了的战士更英雄。但是战士已经战死了，不再来挥去他们。于是乎苍蝇们即更其营营地叫，自以为倒是不朽的声音。……然而，有缺点的战士终竟是战士，完美的苍蝇也终竟不过是苍蝇。”（华盖集）
    孙中山先生的确是伟大的，他为当时一般青年所敬仰。记得我到上海时第一本买的书就是“孙文学说”的小册子。我曾经挤在“中央公园”的人群中去瞻仰过他的遗容。送葬的人各界都有，队伍空前地庞大，是整齐、严肃的。我也一直跟到碧云寺。我只是当时一般青年中的一个。我们闻见了污辱孙中山先生的文字和话非常气愤，鲁迅先生的“战士和苍蝇”说出了我们要说的话。
