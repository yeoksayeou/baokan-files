Hainan Island Harvesting Late Rice

While the northern part of our motherland is already in the early winter season with thousands of miles of ice, the Hainan Island is still bathed in warm sunshine. Everywhere, one can see farmers working diligently in the golden rice fields. This is a scene of members of the Yuliang Township Agricultural Producers' Cooperative in Qiongdong County harvesting late rice.

    海南岛收割晚稻
    祖国的北方，已是千里冰封的初冬季节；但在海南岛大地上还是一片和煦的阳光，到处可以看到在金黄色的稻田里，农民正紧张地劳动。这是琼东县鱼良乡农业生产合作社的社员在收割晚稻。
