    Hunan Winter Water Conservancy Project Commences

    (Our report) The winter water conservancy project in Hunan Province, which suffered a severe drought this year, has started ahead of schedule in some areas. The focus of this year's winter water conservancy work is on the hilly and mountainous areas that were severely affected by the drought. The total winter water conservancy expenditure for the province this year is over 12 million yuan, equivalent to the total investment in the six years from 1950 to 1955.

    The province's two largest key water conservancy projects—the Renhe Dam in Ningyuan and the Tongqiaogang Sluice in Hengyang—started construction ahead of schedule in mid-October. Upon completion of the Renhe Dam in Ningyuan, it can relieve the threat of drought to 34,700 mu of farmland in the irrigation area that is perennially affected by drought, thereby enabling the planting of double-cropping rice. In the Qianyang Special District, which suffered severely from the drought this year, 171 reservoirs are currently under construction. In the Chenxian Special District, the survey and design of 206 projects have been basically completed. (Kuàng Lù'ān)

    湖南冬修水利工程开工
    本报讯　今年遭受严重旱灾的湖南省冬修水利工程已局部提早开工。今年冬修水利的重点是受旱严重的丘陵区和山区。全省今年冬修经费总共一千二百多万元，相当于1950年到1955年六年投资的总和。
    全省两处最大的重点水利工程——宁远的仁和坝和衡阳的桐桥港水闸，已在10月中旬提早动工。宁远仁和坝完工后，可使灌区常年遭旱的三万四千七百亩田解除旱灾威胁，从而能够种上双季稻。今年受旱严重的黔阳专区，目前已有一百七十一座水库动工了。郴县专区已有二百零六处工程基本上完成了勘测设计。（邝麓安）
