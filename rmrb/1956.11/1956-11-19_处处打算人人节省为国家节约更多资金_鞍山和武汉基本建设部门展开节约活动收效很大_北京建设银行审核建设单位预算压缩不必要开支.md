Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, November 17th: From January to October this year, Anshan Iron and Steel's construction workers saved over 7 million yuan in wealth, a figure exceeding the total amount of cost reduction assigned to them by the state for the entire year.

Many units under the Anshan Metallurgical Construction General Company, in this year's Advanced Producer movement, paid attention to timely identifying and correcting the one-sided view of only emphasizing work quantity and neglecting careful calculation in various tasks. During this movement, employees actively put forward rationalization proposals related to savings, and more than 93% of the worker groups implemented class and group economic accounting, saving a large amount of wealth for the country. Many employees received material rewards for their savings achievements.

In the Advanced Producer movement, this company also promoted new technologies and advanced experiences. Among them, the adoption of new technical measures such as dry-hard concrete saved 11,000 tons of cement by the end of September.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, November 17th: Xinhua News Agency reporter Fang Di reports that the capital construction departments of Wuhan City have paid attention to saving building materials and have achieved great results.

According to preliminary statistics, the engineering companies under the Central South Construction Engineering Management Bureau have saved more than 400 tons of steel, nearly 3,000 tons of cement, and a large number of other building materials since the first quarter. From January to October, the Central South Industrial Building Design Institute saved 3,139 tons of steel, 9,071 tons of cement, and 1,122 cubic meters of wood in its designs.

The main methods used by Wuhan's capital construction departments to save building materials are to promote new technologies and advanced experiences. According to the statistics of six engineering companies under the Central South Engineering Management Bureau alone, 79 relatively significant new technologies and advanced experiences have been promoted this year. For example, in terms of saving steel, the promotion of the new technology of cold-drawn rebar has enabled the companies to save more than 200 tons of rebar. The widespread promotion of the new technology of dry-hard concrete has resulted in savings of more than 400 tons of cement for the companies. The Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge Engineering Bureau, due to the promotion of the advanced experience of mixing rubble into large-volume concrete structures, has saved several hundred tons of cement from June to now.

Another important measure taken by the capital construction departments to save building materials is to mobilize the broad masses of employees to pay attention to savings in all aspects from design to construction. Many departments have established savings teams and have put forward slogans such as "Do not waste an inch of steel" and "Save every cubic meter of wood." The concrete engineering company under the Wuhan Metallurgical Chemical Construction General Company, under the condition of ensuring quality, mobilized engineering and technical personnel to change the original reinforced concrete design of eight railway culverts to brick masonry design, which is preliminarily calculated to save 400 tons of steel and 300 tons of cement.

Xinhua News Agency, November 17th: The Beijing Branch of the China Construction Bank strictly examines the design budgets of construction units. In the past ten months, it has reduced unreasonable expenditures by more than 23.2 million yuan, which is 17% more than the city's total reduction in the past year.

When reviewing design budgets, the Municipal Construction Bank organized staff to go deep into construction sites, combined with design and construction requirements, and carefully conducted item-by-item investigations and verifications. It was found that some units were afraid of losing money or affecting the progress of the project and had the phenomenon of overestimating and underusing. For example, the new printing plant construction unit under the Ministry of Culture, in the budget, overestimated material costs and the project cost exceeded the prescribed standards, reporting more than 400,000 yuan, accounting for 10.41% of the original budget. The Beijing Municipal Road Engineering Bureau, in the design budget of road engineering, did not use the unified unit price for materials in the region and deliberately overestimated by more than 52,000 yuan; at the same time, it overestimated the unforeseeable expenses by 124,000 yuan. After the Municipal Construction Bank checked out these deliberately over-reported and overestimated budgets and negotiated with the construction units, they were all reduced.

While reviewing the budget, the Municipal Construction Bank also helped the construction units to mutually adjust various materials, so that long-term stockpiled materials could be used where they were urgently needed. According to the statistics of 87 construction units, in the first three quarters alone, they mutually adjusted and used 20.5 million yuan of materials, reducing the state's capital expenditures.

    处处打算人人节省为国家节约更多资金
    鞍山和武汉基本建设部门展开节约活动收效很大  北京建设银行审核建设单位预算压缩不必要开支
    新华社鞍山17日电　今年1月到10月，鞍钢的建设者节约了七百多万元的财富，这一数字超过了国家给他们规定的全年降低成本的总数。
    鞍山冶金建筑总公司所属的许多单位，今年在先进生产者运动中，注意了及时发现和纠正只重视工作数量而忽视在各种工作中精打细算的片面观点。在这个运动中，职工们积极提出有关节约的合理化建议，同时有93％以上的工人小组推行了班、组经济核算，为国家节约了大量财富。许多职工因为节约有成绩受到了物质奖励。
    这个公司在先进生产者运动中还推广了新技术和先进经验。其中由于采用干硬性混凝土等新的技术措施，到9月底就节约了一万一千吨水泥。
    据新华社武汉17日电　新华社记者方堤报道，武汉市各基本建设部门注意节约建筑材料，已经获得了很大的成果。
    据初步统计：中南建筑工程管理总局所属各工程公司从第一季度以来，已经节约了四百多吨钢材、近三千吨水泥和大量的其他建筑材料。中南工业建筑设计院从1月到10月，在设计中节约了钢材三千一百三十九吨，水泥九千零七十一吨，木材一千一百二十二立方公尺。
    武汉市各基本建设部门节约建筑材料的主要方法是推行新技术和先进经验。单是根据中南工程管理总局所属六个工程公司的统计，今年以来就推行了七十九项比较重大的新技术和先进经验。例如在节约钢材方面，由于推行了冷拉钢筋的新技术，就使各公司节约了二百多吨钢筋。各公司由于普遍推行了干硬性混凝土的新技术，节约的水泥也有四百多吨。武汉长江大桥工程局因为在大体积混凝土构筑物中推行了掺片石的先进经验，从6月到现在已经节约了水泥好几百吨。
    各基本建设部门节约建筑材料的另一个重要措施，是发动广大职工群众从设计到施工的各个方面注意节约。许多部门建立了节约队，并且提出了“不浪费一寸钢筋”、“节约每一立方公尺木材”等口号。武汉冶金化学建筑总公司所属混凝土工程公司，在保证质量的条件下，发动工程技术人员把八个铁路涵洞由原来的钢筋混凝土设计改为砖砌设计，初步计算可以节约钢筋四百吨、水泥三百吨。
    新华社17日讯　中国建设银行北京市分行严格审核建设单位的设计预算，十个月来核减了不合理的支出二千三百二十多万元，比去年一年全市核减的数字还多17％。
    市建设银行在审查设计预算时，组织工作人员，深入建筑工地，结合设计和施工要求，认真地逐项进行调查对证。发现有些单位怕赔钱或怕影响工程进度存在着宽打窄用的现象，如文化部所属的新洗印厂建设单位，在预算中，高估材料费，工程造价又超过规定标准，共多报了四十多万元，占原预算的10.41％。北京市道路工程局在道路工程的设计预算中，材料费不按地区统一单价，有意高估五万二千多元；同时，在不可预见费用一项中，多估了十二万四千元。市建设银行在检查出这些有意多报高估的预算，并且和建设单位协商后，都全部核减了。
    在审查预算的同时，市建设银行并帮助各建设单位互相调剂各种物资，使长期积压的材料用到急需的地方。据八十七个建设单位的统计，仅在前三个季度，就互相调剂和使用了二千零五十万元的物资，使国家减少了资金开支。
