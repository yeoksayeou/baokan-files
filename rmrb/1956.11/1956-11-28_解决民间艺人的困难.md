    Solving the Difficulties of Folk Artists
    Xin Ruoping
    Of the more than 2,000 folk professional opera troupes nationwide, about two-thirds are led by special commissioner offices and county governments. The main audience for these troupes is farmers. Due to the current poor material conditions in rural areas and the troupes' own limitations, these troupes encounter many difficulties in rural performances. Some difficulties cannot be resolved immediately and need to be addressed gradually; however, some difficulties can be resolved, and some places have already resolved them well. I would like to raise some issues seen in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and other places to advocate for folk professional opera troupes and their artists, hoping that relevant departments will consider them:
    First, provide the troupes with accurate tour schedules and ensure their performances.
    Because some people still harbor remnants of the idea of ​​underestimating artists, troupes will encounter unreasonable obstacles from various parties every time they perform in a new place. This phenomenon is not isolated. However, some places do not have this phenomenon. Kunshan County in Jiangsu Province is a good example. When we visited the Huahua Xiju Opera Troupe in Kunshan County, Jiangsu Province, the artists told us that their improved living conditions were mainly due to the importance and support of the county leaders. The county arranged accurate performance schedules for us, telling us when the troupe would go to the countryside, where to go, and how many performances to give. This was arranged by the county and the performance schedule was notified to each district, requiring them to assist. The troupe could perform according to the plan without wasting time. They also told us that once, when the troupe went to a certain district to perform, although the county had formally notified the district, the district cadres insisted on not allowing the troupe to perform. Even a phone call from the county's Culture and Education Section was to no avail. The county magistrate personally called the district head and asked why the troupe was not allowed to perform, and asked him to explain the reasons. As a result, the district had to allow the troupe to perform, and the troupe completed its performance tasks according to the original plan. The attitude of Kunshan County in protecting and being responsible for the troupe is worth learning from everywhere.
    Second, establish fixed performance venues and fixed stages to reduce the extra labor of the troupe.
    Because there are no theaters or fixed performance venues in rural areas, every time the troupe arrives in a new place, they must temporarily find open space and temporarily borrow wooden poles, door panels, ropes, and other items from farmers to build a stage, and then perform on the same day. Sometimes, after only two performances, they must dismantle the stage and return the items to the farmers, and the same process repeats in a new place. This temporary stage construction requires a lot of labor, and the stages built with door panels are uneven, causing the actors to be anxious on stage. Carelessness can lead to falls and injuries.
    In order to ensure the safety of performances and reduce the labor burden on artists, it is recommended that the county's Culture and Education Section establish fixed performance venues in villages or agricultural production cooperatives with relatively concentrated populations, and build an earthen stage at the performance venues. The stage surface should be coated with mud or lime to prevent rain. Establishing fixed performance venues and stages will greatly reduce the troupe's labor and invigorate rural cultural activities. Building an earthen stage is also a simple and feasible matter.
    Third, arrange for the troupe's family members so that they can live and work in peace.
    Many folk professional opera troupes do not have fixed residences, and the troupe's families also move around with the troupe. Because the troupe's mobility is high, the family's travel expenses are a large expenditure, and this expenditure is a heavy burden on the troupe. On the other hand, because the troupe's income is not good and the accommodation conditions are also very poor, the family members, supporting the old and carrying the young, also suffer a lot. Therefore, the issue of settling the troupe's family members is a common demand of the vast majority of artists and their families.
    According to the artists, the Yancheng Special District in Jiangsu Province has done a good job in arranging for the artists' families. For example, Jianhu County in Yancheng Special District built a batch of earthen houses for the troupe, allowing the family members to live in them, and allocated a piece of vegetable garden for the family members to grow vegetables, raise pigs, and raise chickens to engage in sideline production. Some odd jobs such as dismantling and washing quilts and clothes were also introduced to the artists' families. The artists' families not only settled down but also engaged in sideline production to increase income and improve their lives. At the same time, artists can also work with peace of mind, without worries. According to the Huai Opera Troupe of Sheyang County, Yancheng Special District, Sheyang County has also made the same arrangements for the troupe's families throughout the county. The artists are very satisfied with this measure.
    Fourth, reduce the transportation costs of the troupe.
    In the past, because the freight rates for transporting costumes and scenery by train were set too high, the Ministry of Railways accepted the artists' opinions and made new regulations on this freight, greatly reducing the troupe's economic burden and winning praise from the artists. However, this only solved the problems of a few large troupes in some cities, and failed to solve the difficulties of most of the special district and county troupes. Because these troupes are active in the countryside all year round, their main means of transportation is not trains, but cars and ships. According to the artists, in recent years, the transportation costs of cars and ships have gradually increased. For example, if the troupe returns from Taizhou to Huaian, the shipping cost for less than two tons of goods is more than 350 yuan, and according to the regulations of the ship wharf, the handling of goods must be done by the dock workers. It is impossible for the artists to do it themselves to save some handling fees.
    Because the transportation costs of cars and ships are too high, some of the artists in the troupe have to use carts and shoulder poles to transport costumes and props themselves, which seriously affects their health due to overwork. We hope that the transportation management departments can consider the difficulties of folk professional opera troupes and reduce freight rates appropriately, just like the Ministry of Railways.
    Fifth, solve the problem of medical treatment for artists.
    Because these troupes are active in the countryside all year round, the number of performances is mostly around 600 per year, plus the poor living and housing conditions, many artists are ill. Some troupes have even stopped performing because too many people are ill. But it is not easy for artists to see a doctor. Some artists with financial difficulties have to work while sick, and some artists have their illnesses aggravated due to prolonged delays, and even become lifelong diseases.
    In our country, general public employees can enjoy public medical care, and some can pay on account, but these artists cannot enjoy such rights. We hope that health authorities at all levels should designate hospitals for the troupes and allow them to pay on account. For artists who are indeed unable to seek medical treatment due to financial difficulties, the relevant departments should provide relief or subsidies so that they can serve the people healthily and happily.
    The above are not all the difficulties of folk artists, but some of the difficulties that can be resolved. I hope that the relevant departments will consider them.

    解决民间艺人的困难
    辛若平
    在全国二千多个民间职业剧团中，属于专署和县领导的约占三分之二以上。这些剧团的主要服务对象是农民。由于目前农村的物质条件和剧团本身的条件很差，因而这些剧团在农村演出遇到很多困难。有些困难不是马上能够解决的，需要逐步地加以解决；但也有一些困难是可以解决的，而且有的地方已经解决的很好。现就在江苏、浙江等地看到的一些问题，提出来替民间职业剧团的艺人们呼吁一下，希望有关部门加以考虑：
    一，给剧团安排准确的巡回演出计划，并保证剧团的演出。
    由于有些人思想上还存在着轻视艺人的思想残余，剧团每到一处演出，都会多多少少受到各方面无理的刁难，这种现象并不是个别的。但也有一些地方没有这种现象，江苏省昆山县就是一个好的典型。我们在访问江苏省昆山县华华锡剧团的时候，艺人们向我们介绍他们生活好转的原因时说：主要是县的领导对我们重视和支持；县里给我们安排了准确的演出计划，剧团什么时候下乡，到哪里去，演几场，都由县里来进行安排，并把这个演出日程通知各区，要他们协助。剧团可以按照计划演出，不走冤枉路。他们并告诉我们说：有一次剧团到某区演出，虽然县里曾正式通知过那个区，但是区干部却坚持不叫剧团上演，县文教科打来电话也无济于事，县长便亲自打电话问区长：为什么不准剧团演出，并要他说明理由。这样一来，区里只好叫剧团演出了，剧团按原订计划完成了演出任务。像昆山县这种对剧团爱护和负责的态度，是值得各地学习的。
    二，建立固定的演出点和固定戏台，减少剧团的额外劳动。
    因为农村没有剧场和固定的演出场所，剧团每到一处，要临时找空地，要临时向农民借用木杆、门板、绳子等物搭台，当天就进行演出，有时只演两场就要把台拆掉，把东西还给农民，到一个新的地方又是如此。这种临时搭台是要花费很大的劳动的，而且用门板搭的台高低不平，演员在台上演出提心吊胆，一不小心，就有摔倒碰伤的危险。
    为了保证演出的安全和减轻艺人的劳动负担，建议县文教科能在人口比较集中的乡村或农业生产合作社建立起固定的演出点，并在演出点建立一个土台，台面涂抹泥皮或石灰，以防雨淋。设置固定的演出地点和舞台，对减低剧团的劳动和活跃农村文化活动都是有很大作用，而且建立一个土台也是简易可行的事。
    三，对剧团家属给以安排，使他们安居乐业。
    很多民间职业剧团都没有固定的住宅，剧团家属也随着剧团到处流动。因为剧团的流动性很大，家属的路费是一笔很大的开支，这笔开支加在剧团身上是个很大的负担、另一方面，由于剧团收入不好，住宿条件等也很差，家属扶老携幼，也遭受很多苦处。因此，使剧团家属安居下来的问题，是广大艺人和家属们的普遍要求。
    据艺人反映，江苏省盐城专区对艺人家属的安排工作做的很好，如盐城专区的建湖县，给剧团建了一批土房，叫家属住进去，并拨给了一块菜地，家属们可以种菜、养猪、养鸡来搞副业生产，有一些拆洗被子、衣服等零活，也介绍给艺人家属去做。艺人家属们不但安居下来，而且可以搞副业来增加收入，改善生活。同时，艺人也可以安心工作，没有后顾之忧。另据盐城专区射阳县淮剧团反映，射阳县也对全县的剧团家属做了同样的安排。艺人们对这一措施都十分满意。
    四，减低剧团的运输费用。
    过去，因火车运输服装，布景的运费订的过高，铁道部接受了艺人的意见，对此项运费作了新的规定，大大减少了剧团的经济负担，受到艺人的赞美。但是：这仅仅是解决了少数城市的一些大剧团的问题，而未能解决大多数的专区、县剧团的困难。因为这些剧团长年在农村活动，它们主要的运输工具，不是火车，而是汽车和轮船。据艺人反映，几年来，汽车和轮船的运输费逐渐增加，如剧团从泰州回淮安，不到两吨重的物品，轮船运费就要三百五十多元，而且按照轮船码头的规定：物品的搬运必须由码头工人来做，艺人想自己动手来节省一些搬运费都是不可能的。
    由于车船的运输费太高，有些剧团的艺人们不得不用推车和担子来自己搬运服装道具，因过度累劳而严重地影响了健康。我们希望交通运输的管理部门，能考虑到民间职业剧团的困难，像铁道部一样酌量减低运费。
    五，解决艺人的看病问题。
    由于这些剧团长年在农村活动，演出场数一年大多在六百场左右，再加上生活和居住等条件很差，很多艺人都患病，有的剧团甚至因患病者太多而停演。但艺人看病是不容易的，有些生活困难的艺人只好带病工作，有的艺人因拖延日久使病加重，甚至成为终身之症。
    在我们国家里，一般公教人员可以享受公费医疗，有的可以记帐，但是这些艺人却享受不到这样的权利。我们希望各级卫生机关，应该给剧团指定医院，并允许他们记帐。对确实因生活困难而不能就诊的艺人，有关部门应该给予救济或补助，使他们健康地、愉快地为人民服务。
    以上不是民间艺人的全部困难，而是可以解决的一部分困难，希望有关部门加以考虑。
