	Israel—Tool of Imperialism in Disrupting Middle East Peace

	On October 29th, under the instigation of Britain and France, Israel launched an armed invasion of Egypt. Subsequently, Britain and France, under the pretext of "protecting" the Suez Canal and "separating" Israel and Egypt, directly participated in the invasion of Egypt. Imperialists have long created continuous conflicts and disputes between Israel and Arab countries, and then used these conflicts and disputes to achieve their aggressive purposes. The collusion of Britain and France with Israel in the invasion of Egypt is the most blatant and shameless manifestation of the imperialists' "divide and rule" conspiracy.

	The Palestine Question

	The area where Israel is located has always been called Palestine. Palestine was originally a Jewish settlement area before the Common Era, and the Jews had established the Kingdom of Israel and the Kingdom of Judah here. In 70 AD, the Roman Empire captured Jerusalem, and the Jews were expelled. Since then, they have been scattered all over the world.

	In the 1880s, Jewish bourgeois elements in Austria, Russia, Germany, and other countries launched the "Zionist Movement," calling on Jews to return to Palestine to rebuild the "Greater Israel." This movement was supported by the rulers of capitalist countries. At the same time, the Arab people of Palestine, who were suffering from foreign enslavement, also longed to establish an independent Arab state.

	During World War I, in order to use the Arabs to fight against Turkey, Britain assured the Arab rulers that after the war it would help the Arabs establish a unified, independent state including Palestine. But on the other hand, Britain issued the "Balfour Declaration" in 1917, stating that "His Majesty's Government views with favor the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people, and will use their best endeavors to facilitate the achievement of this object." Britain also supplied Zionist elements with weapons, inciting them to plunder Arab land and drive away the Arabs. Britain used this insidious divisive policy to maintain its colonial rule in the Middle East. Therefore, it bears the historical responsibility for first provoking discord between Jews and Arabs. After World War I, in 1922, Britain obtained a mandate over Palestine, turning Palestine into a British colony.

	American forces penetrated Palestine before World War II, mainly in the form of economic penetration (private investment), and in the name of charity, supporting the Jewish bourgeoisie in the United States to purchase land in Palestine for refugees to live in. American monopoly capital, especially oil capital, was very interested in the Middle East. They supported the establishment of a purely Jewish Palestine in order to gain a foothold in the Middle East. Britain, fearing the penetration of American forces into Palestine, firmly rejected the American demand to allow Jewish immigrants to enter Palestine. In 1945, the Truman government of the United States announced that it would help Jewish refugees enter Palestine and establish a Jewish state, which aroused strong opposition from Britain. Later, Britain and the United States organized a committee to "study the political and economic conditions of Palestine," and temporarily reached a compromise on the basis of maintaining British trusteeship over Palestine. However, the Jewish organizations and Arab countries organized by Britain did not recognize this committee, so the Palestine question was later submitted to the United Nations.

	The Establishment of Israel and the Palestine War

	At the end of November 1947, the United Nations passed a resolution on "ending the mandate rule and the independence of the Arab and Jewish nations through partition." The resolution stipulated that the mandate rule over Palestine should end on May 1, 1948; British forces should withdraw on May 1, 1948; and Arab and Jewish independent states should be established in Palestine from May 1, 1948, to July 1, 1948.

	On May 14, 1948, Britain announced the end of its mandate rule in Palestine. At the same time, the Jews announced the establishment of the State of Israel. That very night, due to the instigation of imperialist countries, mainly Britain, a fierce Palestine war broke out between Israel and the Arab countries. In fact, this was a war provoked by British and American imperialism in order to compete for spheres of influence.

	The war lasted for about a year. From February to July 1949, under the mediation of the United Nations, Israel signed armistice agreements with Egypt, Lebanon, Jordan, and Syria respectively. Mixed armistice commissions were established between Israel and the belligerent countries. However, no peace treaty has been concluded to date.

	Post-war Issues

	After the Israeli-Arab armistice, Israel controlled a total of 20,700 square kilometers, 6,700 square kilometers more than the area stipulated in the UN partition plan. The Arab state to be established in the UN partition plan failed to be established. Because Israel occupied territory outside the UN stipulations, Arab countries have never recognized its borders. The two resolutions passed by the UN General Assembly in 1947 regarding the international trusteeship of Jerusalem have also failed to be implemented. During the war, Israel occupied most of the new city of Jerusalem, and Jordan occupied the old city and part of the new city. On January 23, 1950, Israel announced the transfer of its capital from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem; Jordan also immediately announced Jerusalem as its second capital. British and American imperialism often use the Jerusalem issue to provoke Israeli-Arab disputes.

	During the Israeli-Arab war, Israeli Zionist elements burned, killed, looted, and expelled Arabs everywhere, causing nearly a million Arab refugees to leave their homes and flee in all directions. Most of them fled to Jordan, numbering more than 470,000, some to the Gaza Strip in Egypt, numbering more than 200,000, and the rest scattered in Syria and Lebanon and other countries. More than 24,000 people still reside in Israel. The Israeli government discriminates against Arab refugees, restricts their activities, and gives them all kinds of unequal treatment; the Arab refugees who have fled also live in extreme hardship. They demand to return to their homes, but are rejected by the Israeli authorities. The Israeli government's policy towards Arab refugees has deepened the national hatred between Arabs and Jews.

	Because the issues of borders, Jerusalem, and refugees have not been resolved, and even more because British and American imperialism frequently carry out insidious instigation, Israel and the Arab countries are nominally at armistice, but conflicts have been going on.

	Israeli-Arab Conflicts and the United States

	Since World War II, the primary responsibility for the endless Israeli-Arab conflicts lies with American and British imperialism.

	Britain has strong economic forces in Israel. However, after World War II, the influence and power of the United States in Israel rapidly increased. The United States openly supported the Zionist movement, and former US President Truman openly supported the transfer of 100,000 Jews from Europe to Palestine. The United States also provided economic assistance to Israel. Up to this fiscal year, the United States has provided Israel with approximately $260 million in economic aid. The United States also supplies Israel with arms.

	The purpose of the United States in intensifying its control over Israel in this way is to turn Israel into an American base for expansion in the Middle East, using it to coerce Arab countries into submission, thereby dragging the Middle East and Near East countries into aggressive military blocs, and further threatening the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries. Last February, just after the Baghdad Pact was signed, Israel, at the instigation of American and British imperialism, intensified its provocations and attacks against Arab countries, month after month. These are all methods used by American and British imperialism to use Israel to force Arab countries to join the Baghdad Pact Group.

	But on the surface, the United States puts on a posture of "mediator." However, the people of the Arab countries are very clear about the true face of the United States. Egyptian President Nasser pointed out in March this year when he met with the international news editor of the Scripps-Howard newspapers that the United States should be responsible for the current Israeli-Arab disputes.

	Britain, France, and Israel Collude to Invade Egypt

	After the Suez Canal incident, Israel's provocative actions against Arab countries, especially Egypt, became more frequent and of a more serious nature. On August 17, the Israeli army launched two offensives in the Gaza Strip; from September, Israeli troops continuously attacked strongholds along the Jordanian border. The Israeli-Jordanian Mixed Armistice Commission requested Israel to stop its war actions against Jordan, but Israel not only did not listen to these opinions, but unilaterally withdrew from the Mixed Armistice Commission, and launched a new offensive against the Kalkili area of Jordan on the evening of October 10. At the United Nations Security Council on October 19, Israel's aggressive actions were condemned by the Soviet Union, Iran, and other countries. Many reports indicate that Israel's attack on Jordan was encouraged by Western countries. Britain and other colonial countries attempted to use Israel's hostile actions against Arab countries to divert the attention of Arab countries from the focus of the current struggle between colonialism and anti-colonialism—the Suez Canal issue—and weaken the solidarity of Arab countries.

	After this conspiracy failed, the Israeli government, under the instigation of Britain and France, launched a large-scale offensive against Egypt on October 29 without any reason, invading the Sinai Peninsula of Egypt. Immediately following Israel's invasion of Egypt, Britain and France launched a war of aggression against Egypt.

	The Israeli government's action of acting as a tool of colonialism and taking chestnuts out of the fire for colonialists has been severely condemned by the world; it is by no means beneficial to Israel itself, it can only make the situation in the Middle East more complicated, and Israel will be in the pitiful position of an "orphan of the Middle East."

### 以色列——帝国主义破坏中东和平的工具

    以色列——帝国主义破坏中东和平的工具
    10月29日，以色列在英、法的指使下发动了对埃及的武装侵略。接着，英、法就以“保护”苏伊士运河、“隔开”以色列和埃及为借口，直接参加了对埃及的侵略。帝国主义者长期以来一手制造以色列和阿拉伯国家之间的不断的冲突和纠纷，然后又利用这些冲突和纠纷来达到自己的侵略目的。英、法勾结以色列对埃及的侵略，是帝国主义者这种“分而治之”的阴谋的一次最露骨最无耻的表现。
    巴勒斯坦问题
    以色列所在的地区，一向称为巴勒斯坦。巴勒斯坦在纪元前原为犹太人的聚居地，犹太人曾在这里建立过以色列国和犹太国。纪元前七十年，罗马帝国攻下耶路撒冷，犹太人被逐出境。从此，他们就流落在世界各地。
    十九世纪八十年代，在奥地利、俄国、德国和其他各国的犹太资产阶级分子发起了“犹太复国主义运动”，号召犹太人回到巴勒斯坦去重建“大以色列国”。这个运动得到资本主义国家统治者的支持。同时，饱受外国奴役痛苦的巴勒斯坦的阿拉伯人也渴望成立一个独立的阿拉伯国家。
    第一次世界大战中，英国为了利用阿拉伯人对土耳其作战，向阿拉伯统治者保证在战后帮助阿拉伯人建立一个把巴勒斯坦包括在内的统一、独立的国家。但是另一方面，英国又在1917年发表了“巴尔福宣言”，申明“英帝国政府赞助以巴勒斯坦为犹太民族之家，并将以最善意的努力来促成这个目标”。英国还供给犹太复国主义者以武器，怂恿他们掠夺阿拉伯人的土地，并把阿拉伯人赶走。英国用这种阴险的挑拨政策，来维持自己在中东的殖民统治。因此，它负有最先挑起犹太人和阿拉伯人之间的民族不和的历史责任。在第一次世界大战以后，1922年英国取得了对巴勒斯坦的委任统治，把巴勒斯坦变成了英国的殖民地。
    美国势力在第二次世界大战前就伸入了巴勒斯坦，主要是采取经济渗入（私人投资）的形式，以及以慈善事业的名义，支持在美国的犹太资产阶级在巴勒斯坦购买供难民居住的土地。美国垄断资本，特别是石油资本，对中东极感兴趣，他们支持建立一个纯粹是犹太人的巴勒斯坦，以插足中东。英国害怕美国势力伸入巴勒斯坦，坚决拒绝美国的让犹太移民进入巴勒斯坦的要求。1945年，美国杜鲁门政府宣称要帮助犹太难民进入巴勒斯坦，建立犹太国家，引起英国强烈反对。后来，英美组织了一个“研究巴勒斯坦政治经济条件”委员会，在保持英国对巴勒斯坦托管权的基础上暂时求得了妥协。但是英国所组织的犹太人团体和阿拉伯国家都不承认这个委员会，因此，巴勒斯坦问题后来被提交到了联合国。
    以色列的建立和巴勒斯坦战争
    1947年11月底，联合国通过了“结束委任统治，阿拉伯、犹太两族分治独立”的决议。决议规定：巴勒斯坦的委任统治应从1948年5月1日起结束；英国武力应于1948年5月1日撤退；自1948年5月1日至7月1日，应在巴勒斯坦建立阿拉伯和犹太两个独立国家。
    1948年5月14日，英国宣布结束它在巴勒斯坦的委任统治，与此同时，犹太人宣布成立以色列共和国。就在当天晚上，由于帝国主义国家，主要是英国的挑拨，以色列和阿拉伯国家间爆发了惨烈的巴勒斯坦战争。实际上这是一场英、美帝国主义为了争夺势力范围而挑起的战争。
    战争打了一年左右，1949年2月到7月，在联合国的调停下，以色列分别同埃及、黎巴嫩、约旦和叙利亚签订了停战协定。成立了以色列和各交战国的混合停战委员会。但是迄今没有订立和约。
    战后问题
    以、阿停战后，以色列共控制了二万零七百平方公里，较联合国分治计划中所规定的面积多六千七百平方公里。联合国分治计划中要成立的阿拉伯国家未能成立。由于以色列占领了联合国规定以外的领土，阿拉伯国家一直不承认它的疆界。1947年联合国大会两次关于国际托管耶路撒冷的决议也未能实现。在战争中，以色列占领了耶路撒冷新城的大部，约旦占领了旧城和新城的一部。1950年1月23日，以色列宣布从特拉维夫迁都耶路撒冷；约旦也随即宣布耶路撒冷为其第二首都。英美帝国主义经常利用耶路撒冷问题挑拨以阿纠纷。
    在以阿战争中，以色列的犹太复国主义分子到处烧杀抢掠，驱逐阿拉伯人，使得近百万阿拉伯难民离乡背井，四处逃亡。他们大部分逃在约旦，约有四十七万余人，一部分在埃及加沙地带，约二十余万人，其余分散在叙利亚和黎巴嫩等国。仍留居在以色列的有二万四千多人。以色列政府歧视阿拉伯难民，限制他们的活动，给予种种不平等待遇；逃亡在外的阿拉伯难民生活也极端困苦，他们要求返回他们的家园，但遭到以色列当局的拒绝。以色列政府对阿拉伯难民的政策，加深了阿拉伯人和犹太人之间的民族仇恨。
    由于疆界问题、耶路撒冷问题、难民问题等没有获得解决，更由于英美帝国主义经常进行阴险的挑拨，以、阿名义上停战了，冲突却一直在进行。
    以阿冲突和美国
    第二次世界大战以来，对层出不穷的以—阿冲突首先要负责的是美英帝国主义。
    英国在以色列有强大的经济势力。但是第二次世界大战以后，美国在以色列的影响和势力迅速增强。美国公开支持犹太复国主义运动，美国前总统杜鲁门就曾公开支持把十万犹太人从欧洲移入巴勒斯坦。美国并在经济上资助以色列。到本财政年度为止，美国已供给以色列大约二亿六千万美元的经济援助。美国还以军火供给以色列。
    美国这样加紧控制以色列，目的是要把以色列变为美国在中东的扩张基地，利用它来胁迫阿拉伯国家就范，从而把中近东国家都拖进侵略军事集团，进而威胁苏联与人民民主国家。去年2月巴格达条约刚刚签订后，以色列就在美英帝国主义的唆使下加紧向阿拉伯国家挑衅与进攻，月月不断。这都是美英帝国主义利用以色列来迫使阿拉伯国家参加巴格达条约集团的手段。
    可是表面上，美国却摆出“调停人”的姿态。但是，阿拉伯各国人民对于美国的真面目却是知道得很清楚的。埃及总统纳赛尔今年3月接见美国斯克利浦斯——霍华德系报纸国际新闻编辑时就曾经指出，美国要为目前的以—阿纠纷负责。英、法、以色列串通侵略埃及
    苏伊士运河事件发生以后，以色列对阿拉伯国家特别是对埃及的挑衅行动又频繁起来，而且性质更加严重。8月17日，以色列军在加沙地带发动了两次进攻；从9月起，以色列部队不断袭击约旦边境内的据点。以—约联合停战委员会要求以色列停止对约旦的战争行动，但以色列不仅没有听从这些意见，反而单方面退出了联合停战委员会，并在10月10日晚上向约旦卡尔基利地区发动了新的进攻。10月19日的联合国安全理事会上，以色列的侵略行动受到苏联、伊朗等国的谴责。许多消息说明，以色列对约旦的进攻是受到西方国家的鼓励的。英国和其他殖民国家企图利用以色列对阿拉伯国家的敌对行动，以分散阿拉伯国家对当前殖民主义与反殖民主义斗争的焦点——苏伊士运河问题的注意，削弱阿拉伯国家的团结力量。
    在这个阴谋失败以后，以色列政府又在英、法的指使下，无缘无故在10月29日发动了对埃及的大规模进攻，侵入了埃及的西奈半岛。紧接着以色列的入侵埃及，英法就对埃及发动了侵略战争。
    以色列政府这种充当殖民主义的工具、为殖民主义者火中取栗的行动，已经受到全世界的严厉指责；它对以色列本身也决无好处，只能使中东局势更加复杂化，而以色列也将处于“中东孤儿”的可悲地位。
