Demand that British and French Aggressors Immediately Withdraw from Egyptian Territory

    This newspaper reports that people across the country continue to engage in various activities to enthusiastically support Egypt's resistance against British and French aggression, demanding that the aggressors immediately withdraw from Egyptian territory. Representatives attending the National Congress of Active Builders of Socialism of Families of Martyrs, Families of Military Personnel, Disabled Servicemen, and Demobilized Servicemen, currently being held in Beijing, stated in a telegram supporting the Egyptian people's resistance against aggression: "The families of martyrs, families of military personnel, disabled servicemen, and demobilized servicemen in China have personally suffered the disasters brought about by imperialist aggressors, and have directly or indirectly participated in wars against aggression and for independence. They understand the value of national independence, freedom, and world peace, and they also understand that independent, free, and peaceful lives can only be achieved through their own heroic struggles."
    Four thousand people from all walks of life in the Qamdo area held a meeting on the afternoon of the 8th to support Egypt's opposition to armed aggression by British and French imperialism. The meeting was presided over by National People's Congress representatives Bonda Dorje and Gesang Wangdui. They stated at the meeting: "We Tibetan people love peace and justice. We love the independence of our motherland and respect the sovereignty of other countries. We fully support our government's statement and, together with the 600 million people of our country, firmly and wholeheartedly support the just struggle of the Egyptian people. In the past, British imperialists had long engaged in conspiracies and provocations in Tibet. In 1950, they viciously murdered our beloved Geda Living Buddha in Qamdo. Today, they are dropping criminal bombs in the skies of Egypt together with French imperialists. We, all members of the religious community, resolutely protest the barbarous and inhumane aggression of the British and French governments and wholeheartedly support the just struggle of the Egyptian people."
    At the meeting, a message of respect to the Egyptian people and a message of protest against the aggression of the British and French governments were unanimously adopted.
    Linxia City, where the Hui people of Gansu Province live in concentrated communities, held a demonstration march and mass rally of more than 15,000 people on the 8th to support Egypt's resistance against British and French aggression.
    In the marching队伍，there were Hui workers, farmers, students, and shop assistants wearing white and black caps, and Hui women wearing various colored headscarves. More than 150 imams and mullahs from the 31 mosques in Linxia City all participated in the march and rally.
    Eighty-eight-year-old Hui Imam Ma Guozhen rode a donkey to participate in the meeting. Eighty-six-year-old Imam Erli of Hua Temple Gongbei, leaning on a cane in one hand and holding a small flag in the other, walked among the crowd. Mullahs from Guangpoyan Temple, more than 50 miles away from Linxia City, also came to participate in the march.
    People of all ethnic groups in the Jirem League of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region held a gathering of more than 700 people in Tongliao City on the 8th, and they spoke out one after another to condemn the aggressive actions of Britain and France. Seyinbayaer (Mongolian), a member of the Inner Mongolia Jirem League Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, said: "Although Britain and France have been forced to announce a ceasefire, the people of all ethnic groups in our league must continue to do our best to support the Egyptian people and strive for final victory. We must drive the British, French, and Israeli troops out of Egypt."
    The entire delegation of the Second First Session of the Xilin Gol League People's Congress, which is being held in the grassland city of Xilinhot, passed a special resolution on the afternoon of the 8th. The resolution demands that all invading troops be immediately driven out of Egyptian territory.
    The Jiangsu Provincial and Nanjing Municipal Branches of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace have continuously received letters and donations from many people these days, expressing their support for the Egyptian people's struggle against the aggression of British and French imperialism. Xu Jinxian and Ren Xinglin, doctors at the Health Center of the Mausoleum District in Nanjing City, wrote in a joint letter: "We are willing to dedicate our lives to directly participate in this just anti-aggression struggle alongside the Egyptian people; if our country has a volunteer team to assist the Egyptian people, we will be the first to sign up to join." Students from the Agronomy Department of Nanjing Agricultural College wrote to the Egyptian youth: "When necessary, we will put down our books and fight alongside you—our dear brothers and sisters—until the final victory." Representatives of all Muslims in Jianye District, Nanjing City, also expressed in a letter their willingness to use all their strength to support the just struggle of the Egyptian people.
    Duanmu Yisheng and Zhao Jingxian of Nanjing Normal College donated 50 yuan in Renminbi, and Yang Ruiyi, a student in a junior high school tutorial class in Taixing County, Cui Jiguang, a resident of Nanjing, students from Nanjing Institute of Technology, and others have voluntarily donated more than 100 yuan in Renminbi to support Egypt.
