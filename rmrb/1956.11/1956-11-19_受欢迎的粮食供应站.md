    Popular Grain Supply Station
    Yang Changfeng
    The people of Lishan District, Anshan City, Liaoning Province, all praise the "March 8th" Youth Grain Supply Station on Ziyou Street, unanimously commending the good service attitude of the staff.
    The "March 8th" Youth Grain Supply Station was established in November of last year. All seven employees in the station are women. Over the past year, due to their good work and their good relationship with the masses, they have been successively recognized as advanced units in the grain systems of Lishan District, Anshan City, and Liaoning Province. Comrade Sun Ying, a salesperson, recently attended the National Conference of Advanced Grain Workers.
    The reason why the "March 8th" Youth Grain Supply Station is praised by the masses and has become an advanced supply unit is inseparable from their working attitude of truly considering the masses and striving to overcome difficulties. When this supply station was first established, many people did not believe they could handle the job. Some said, "Women like to be clean; how can they do such hard and dirty work? Besides, they can't carry the grain sacks!" Hearing these words, they encouraged each other, saying, "If Guo Junqing can fight enemies on the battlefield and Liang Jun can drive a tractor, can't we even do the work of salespersons well? We must do it well." Initially, some of the seven could not use an abacus, and some could not read the scales. In fact, difficulties cannot scare away those who are determined. After studying in their spare time, everyone learned. If a grain sack was heavy and one person could not carry it, two people would lift it together, or they would scoop out some grain first and then lift it. In this way, all kinds of difficulties were overcome one by one.
    In their work, they often thought: Most of those who come to the supply station to buy grain are employees and family members of Angang (Anshan Iron and Steel Group Corporation). Doing a good job in grain supply is supporting Angang, which is also supporting the country's socialist industrialization. Therefore, their enthusiasm for work is even higher. Whenever the masses come to buy grain, they always greet customers with smiles and try to meet their requirements. At the same time, they also prepare needles, thread, bottle stoppers, and pocket strings for customers to help them solve temporary difficulties. Whenever elderly people, pregnant women, or children buy grain and cannot carry it, they ask for their names and addresses and deliver the grain to their homes after work. Grandma Su, who is seventy-five years old, is old and has poor eyesight, making it difficult to buy grain. Whenever it is Grandma Su's turn to buy grain, the salesperson Sun Ying goes to her house to collect her grain purchase certificate, bag, and money, and packs the grain she wants to buy and delivers it to her. Grandma Su often says with emotion, "It's really different after liberation. There was no such good thing before. This is all thanks to Chairman Mao's leadership!"
    In order to do a good job in supply, the salespersons of the "March 8th" Youth Grain Supply Station also implemented a method of "assigning areas and going deep into the masses." They divided the residents' addresses into several supply areas, and each person was responsible for understanding the number of households, population, economic situation, grain consumption habits, and opinions on the types of grain supplied in their assigned area. Based on the actual needs of the masses, they submit monthly grain supply plans for various types of grain to the Lishan District Grain Supply Department, so customers can buy the grain they want. When there is a shortage of grain types or insufficient supply, they give priority to those with special needs. In this way, they try their best to take care of grain-buying households with different living habits and can also be forgiven by other customers.
    The cleaning work of the "March 8th" Youth Grain Supply Station is also done very well. They have established a system of major cleaning once a week, and covers are placed on the counters for storing flour and other grains. Therefore, the grain they supply is particularly clean.
    They also often promote the state's grain supply policies and the importance of saving grain at residents' meetings, organize the masses to visit the supply station, and explain the nutritional value of various grains to the masses. Residents say that they can not only often buy various grains they like to eat from them but also understand the importance of saving grain and the benefits of eating certain grains for their health.

    受欢迎的粮食供应站
    杨昌凤
    辽宁省鞍山市立山区的人们，一提起自由街“三八”青年粮食供应站，大家都异口同声地称赞营业员的服务态度好。
    “三八”青年粮食供应站是在去年11月建立的，站里的七位营业员全都是女同志。一年来，由于她们的工作好，同群众的关系好，曾先后被评为立山区、鞍山市和辽宁省粮食系统的先进单位。营业员孙颖同志，最近又出席了全国粮食先进工作者代表会议。
    “三八”青年粮食供应站能够受到群众的称赞，并且成为先进的供应单位，是同她们真正为群众着想，努力克服困难的工作态度分不开的。这个供应站刚成立时，许多人都不相信她们能够胜任这个工作。有的说：“女同志都喜欢干净，那能干这又累又脏的活儿？再说，她们也扛不动粮袋呀！”她们听了这些话，就彼此鼓励说：“郭俊卿能在战场上杀敌，梁军能开拖拉机，难道我们连营业员的工作都作不好吗？我们一定要把它做好。”最初，她们七个人中有的不会打算盘，有的不识秤。其实，困难吓不倒有心人。她们利用业余时间学习了不久，大家都学会了。粮袋重，一个人扛不动，就两个人抬，或者先舀出一些粮食再抬。就这样，各式各种的困难都被她们一个一个的克服了。
    在工作中，她们常常这样想：到供应站买粮的大多数是鞍钢的职工和职工家属，做好粮食供应工作，就是支援鞍钢，也就是支援国家社会主义工业化。因此，她们的工作积极性更高。每当群众来买粮的时候，她们总是和颜悦色地招呼顾客，尽量满足顾客的要求；同时她们还为顾客们准备了针线、瓶塞、口袋绳，以便帮助顾客解决临时发生的困难。每逢老人、孕妇、小孩买粮拿不动的时候，就问清他们的姓名和住址，在下班后替他们把粮送去。七十五岁的苏老大娘，年岁大，眼力不好，买粮困难，营业员孙颖每到苏老大娘该买粮的日期，就到她家里去取购粮证、口袋和钱，替她把要买的粮食装好送去。苏老大娘常常感动地说：“解放后真是和以前不同了，以前哪有这样好的事，这就是毛主席领导的好！”
    为了搞好供应工作，“三八”青年粮食供应站的营业员们还实行了“分片包干、深入群众”的办法。她们按居民的住址划成几个供应片，每个人负责了解自己所分担的供应片的户数、人口、经济情况和用粮习惯，以及对供应粮食品种的意见。她们根据群众实际需要的情况，向立山区粮食供应部提出每个月的各种粮食供应计划，因此顾客们都能买到自己想买的粮食。当粮食品种缺少，货源不足的时候，她们就优先照顾有特殊需要的人。这样，她们作到了尽量照顾不同生活习惯的买粮户，并且也能得到其它顾客的原谅。
    “三八”青年粮食供应站的清洁工作也做的很好。她们规定了每星期大扫除一次的制度，在储存面粉等粮食的柜子上，都盖上罩子，因此，她们供应的粮食特别干净。
    她们还经常在居民会议上宣传国家的粮食供应政策和节约粮食的道理，组织群众到供应站来参观，向群众讲解各种粮食的营养价值。居民们都说，从她们那里，不但经常能买到自己爱吃的各种粮食，而且还懂得了节约粮食的道理和吃哪一种粮食对身体有什么好处。
