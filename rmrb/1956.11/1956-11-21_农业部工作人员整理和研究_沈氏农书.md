    Ministry of Agriculture staff are currently sorting out and studying two books written by people from Zhejiang during the late Ming and early Qing dynasties: "Shen's Agricultural Book" and "Supplement to Agricultural Book." In addition to collating them based on different versions, they are also visiting elderly farmers in rural areas to verify the production experience described in the books.

    "Shen's Agricultural Book" was written by a Mr. Shen from Huzhou during the Chongzhen reign of the Ming Dynasty, whose name has been lost. In the early Qing Dynasty, Zhang Lüxiang, a scholar from Tongxiang County, referred to "Shen's Agricultural Book" and wrote "Supplement to Agricultural Book." The content of "Shen's Agricultural Book" is a specific plan for year-round agricultural and sideline production based on the twelve months and twenty-four solar terms. The book provides detailed explanations of what agricultural work should be done in each month on sunny, cloudy, and rainy days, how to cultivate fields and fertilize, and how to replant rice paddies after floods. The book also records detailed experiences in silkworm rearing, pig farming, and sheep farming. This book was once included in the "Siku Quanshu." "Supplement to Agricultural Book" mostly contains agricultural production experiences from Tongxiang County, which are also very specific and detailed.

    农业部工作人员整理和研究“沈氏农书”
    新华社讯　明末清初浙江人撰写的“沈氏农书”和“补农书”两种，正由农业部工作人员加以整理和研究。他们除了根据不同刻本加以校勘以外，还下乡访问老年农民，就书中介绍的生产经验进行校证。
    “沈氏农书”是明朝崇祯年间湖州一位姓沈的所写，他的名字已经失传。到清朝初年，桐乡县学者张履祥参考“沈氏农书”，又写了一本“补农书”。“沈氏农书”的内容，是作者按照十二个月令和二十四个节气，对常年的农副业生产作了具体规划。每个月天晴、天阴、下雨应该做些什么农活，怎样种田、施肥，稻田受到水灾以后应当怎样补种，对于这些问题，书中都有详尽的说明。书中还详细记载了养蚕和养猪养羊的经验。这本书曾经被收进“四库全书”。“补农书”中大多是桐乡县的农业生产经验，也十分具体和详细。
