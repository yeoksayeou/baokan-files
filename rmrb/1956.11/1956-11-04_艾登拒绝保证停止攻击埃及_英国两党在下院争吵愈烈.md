Xinhua News Agency, London, November 3rd. The British Parliament continues its session, and sharper conflicts erupted in the House of Commons on the 2nd between the government party and the opposition party.

    Opposition leader Gaitskell said that they expected Eden to state unequivocally that the government accepted the ceasefire resolution passed by the United Nations General Assembly. They also expected the government to immediately issue instructions that no further military measures should be taken.

    Former Labour government Air Force Minister Arthur Henderson asked if the Prime Minister was willing to guarantee that he would prevent all further armed attacks on Egypt before he considered the resolution. Eden replied: "No. Sir. I cannot give that guarantee."

    Conservative MP Sir Harry Mackeson even shouted that Conservatives were impatient with the questioning. He also said that Labour was wasting time by asking these questions.

    Labour MP Emrys Hughes retorted: "Are people to be killed over the weekend while the government considers the matter?"

    After a long period of confusion and pressure from Labour, the government was finally forced to agree that the House of Commons would hold a special meeting on the 3rd, at which time Eden would make another statement on the Suez issue.

    艾登拒绝保证停止攻击埃及
    英国两党在下院争吵愈烈
    据新华社伦敦3日电　英国议会会议继续举行，2日下院里政府党和反对党之间发生了更尖锐的冲突。
    反对党领袖盖次克尔说，他们期待艾登毫无保留地表明政府接受联合国大会通过的停火决议。他们还期待政府立刻发出不得采取任何进一步的军事措施的指示。
    前工党政府空军大臣阿瑟·汉德逊问，首相是不是愿意保证，在他对这个决议加以考虑之前将制止一切对埃及的进一步的武装攻击。艾登回答说：“不。先生。我不能提出这种保证。”
    保守党议员哈里·麦凯逊爵士甚至大声喊叫说，保守党人对质问感到不耐烦了。他还说，工党提这些问题是浪费时间。
    工党议员埃姆里斯·休斯反驳说：“难道在政府考虑问题的时候，就让人们在周末的时候被杀死吗？”
    经过长时间的混乱和来自工党的压力，政府终于被迫同意下院要在3日举行特别会议，那时艾登将就苏伊士问题发表另一次声明。
