    A Reference Book for Studying "Philosophical Notebooks"
    —Introducing "On Lenin's 'Philosophical Notebooks'"—
    Gu Jinping
    "On Lenin's 'Philosophical Notebooks'" is a record of lectures given by Soviet expert Comrade Giselev to assist the Compilation and Translation Bureau of the Works of Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in resolving difficult problems in the translation and proofreading work of the "Philosophical Notebooks." These lectures will be helpful and useful not only to translators but also to the general readership.
    This book has two advantages. First, it summarizes Lenin's rich and scattered remarks into several main issues, such as the problem of dialectics, the problem of epistemology, the problem of dialectical logic, and the unity of dialectics, epistemology, and logic, and discusses them systematically. Therefore, the key points are more prominent, and comrades who are new to the "Philosophical Notebooks" can obtain a line to follow from this. Second, this book examines the ideas in the "Philosophical Notebooks" in connection with Lenin's theoretical and revolutionary practice activities in the early and later periods. Through this introduction, we can more deeply understand the development process of Lenin's philosophical thought and its revolutionary practical significance.
    The book is divided into nine chapters. The first chapter provides a general introduction to the content and characteristics of the "Philosophical Notebooks," explaining the historical background when Lenin took philosophical notes, and Lenin's contribution to Marxist philosophy.
    The second chapter systematically introduces the doctrines of Hegel and Feuerbach and Lenin's evaluation of them. Hegel was an outstanding dialectician before Marx, and he expressed the basic principles of dialectics on an idealist basis. Lenin attached great importance to Hegel's philosophy. There are three excerpts on Hegel's works in the "Philosophical Notebooks." Lenin made particularly detailed excerpts from Hegel's "Logic" and wrote many important annotations. However, many parts of Hegel's works are full of mysticism and are obscure and difficult to understand. When Lenin read the "Subjectivity" chapter in "Logic," he could not help but write: "These parts of this work should be called: the best way to cause a headache!" The second chapter of this book first systematically introduces Hegel's philosophical system, so that we have a comprehensive understanding of Hegel's philosophy, which makes it easier to understand Lenin's excerpted fragments of Hegel's remarks and Lenin's criticism of Hegel. Secondly, this chapter points out the rational core of Hegel's philosophy and criticizes its mysticism, which can help us distinguish between right and wrong in Hegel's philosophy, so as not to be confused by Hegel's idealism, nor to arbitrarily abandon the rational core of Hegel. The second chapter also systematically discusses the philosophy of Feuerbach, an outstanding materialist before Marx, and criticizes the limitations of his intuitive materialism, which is undoubtedly also helpful for studying Lenin's summary of Feuerbach's "Lectures on the Essence of Religion" and "Leibniz."
    The third chapter focuses on the problem of dialectics in the "Philosophical Notebooks." Lenin put forward many brilliant insights on the problem of dialectics in the "Philosophical Notebooks." He paid special attention to the law of the unity and struggle of opposites, and believed that it was the core and essence of dialectics. The author of this book elaborates on Lenin's development of dialectics around the three laws of dialectics, namely the unity and struggle of opposites, the transformation of quantitative change into qualitative change, and the negation of negation. At the same time, it also clarifies the specific content of the law of the unity and struggle of opposites, pointing out why this law is the core and essence of dialectics. The author believes that the law of the unity and struggle of opposites reveals the source of the movement of all things in the real world, so it is the key to understanding the leap, that is, understanding the law of the transformation of quantitative change into qualitative change; at the same time, it is also the key to understanding the death of old things and the emergence of new things, that is, understanding the law of the negation of negation. In this sense, the law of the unity and struggle of opposites is the core of dialectics. The author also analyzes Lenin's proposed sixteen elements of dialectics one by one.
    The problem of epistemology has always been the center of Lenin's attention. After "Materialism and Empirio-Criticism," Lenin creatively developed Marxist epistemology in the "Philosophical Notebooks." The fourth chapter of this book introduces in a more popular way Lenin's views on important issues such as the dialectical nature of the cognitive process, subjective initiative, and the roots of idealist epistemology. It analyzes in detail the dialectical process of "from vivid intuition to abstract thinking, and from abstract thinking to practice" that Lenin pointed out, and criticizes the confused views on the role of practice in the cognitive process, pointing out that practice is not only the third stage of cognition, but also the source and foundation of cognition, and it runs through the entire cognitive process. This chapter also explores an important instruction from Lenin: to establish a correct epistemology, it is necessary to philosophically summarize the development history of various sciences, the intellectual development history of children and animals, the development history of language, and so on.
    The fifth chapter focuses on exploring how Lenin defined dialectical logic in the "Philosophical Notebooks" and how he stipulated the content and structure of dialectical logic. The author criticizes the erroneous attempts of some Soviet logicians to deny dialectical logic, and proves that Lenin, like Engels, affirmed the existence of two kinds of logic, one is formal logic and the other is dialectical logic. The author thoroughly analyzes Lenin's brilliant instructions on dialectical logic. These analyses are of great reference value for us to deeply understand Lenin's instructions and resolve the current debate in China's academic circles on formal logic and dialectical logic.
    The author then reveals in the sixth chapter the important principle of the unity of dialectics, epistemology and logic proposed by Lenin. This principle of Lenin's has not received due attention and in-depth research in the philosophical circles in the past. The elaboration of this principle in this book is enlightening. The author puts forward his own view on this principle, believing that: epistemology is the application of materialist dialectics in explaining the cognitive process, and dialectical logic is the application of materialist dialectics in explaining the process of logical cognition (rational cognition). In this sense, dialectics, epistemology and logic are unified. However, they are not things that can offset each other, they are different manifestations of dialectical materialism, each performing special functions.
    The seventh chapter is specifically about the short essay "On the Question of Dialectics." This is Lenin's brilliant philosophical work and a summary of Lenin's research work on dialectics, raising materialist dialectics to a new stage. The introduction in this chapter points out the way for us to study this work.
    The eighth chapter mainly introduces the problem of the history of philosophy in the "Philosophical Notebooks." The author discusses the methodological principles and partisan principles that Lenin put forward to researchers of the history of philosophy in the "Philosophical Notebooks," as well as Lenin's evaluation of Hegel's view of the history of philosophy, clarifying how Lenin critically treated philosophy before Marx from the standpoint of militant materialism.
    The final chapter points out how Lenin further developed the theories proposed in the "Philosophical Notebooks" in his writings after 1915 and how he used these theories to guide revolutionary practice. For example, Lenin used the principle of the inseparable universality and particularity proposed in the "Philosophical Notebooks" to analyze complex social phenomena, and made a conclusion with important practical significance: "All nations will go to socialism, this is inevitable, but the methods of going are not exactly the same. In the form of democracy, in the form of the dictatorship of the proletariat, and in the speed of the socialist transformation in all aspects of social life, each nation will have its own characteristics." In the book "Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism," Lenin further developed the theory of contradiction proposed in the "Philosophical Notebooks" through the analysis of the contradictions of capitalism. When Lenin opposed Bukharin's eclectic position on the trade union issue, he developed dialectical logic and analyzed the relationship between formal logic and dialectical logic. He put forward four requirements of dialectical logic. The author also discusses the connection between the "Philosophical Notebooks" and the article "On the Significance of Militant Materialism." The Soviet philosophical circles regard this article as Lenin's legacy to them. Its content is very close to the "Philosophical Notebooks," and many of the arguments in the "Philosophical Notebooks" have been further developed in this article. Through the vivid elaboration in this chapter, we can clearly see that Lenin's thought is a guide for creative revolutionary activities.
    The above is the basic content of this book.
    Lenin's "Philosophical Notebooks" are a treasure house of philosophical thought, and we need to explore its rich philosophical heritage through independent thinking. The book "On Lenin's 'Philosophical Notebooks'" can enlighten beginners on the understanding of some important theoretical issues in the "Philosophical Notebooks" and help beginners to deeply study Lenin's work.

    学习“哲学笔记”的一本参考书
    ——介绍“关于列宁的‘哲学笔记’”——
    顾锦屏
    “关于列宁的‘哲学笔记’”一书是苏联专家吉谢辽夫同志为帮助中共中央马克思恩格斯列宁斯大林著作编译局在“哲学笔记”译校工作中解决疑难问题而作的讲演记录。这些讲演不仅对译者，而且对广大读者都会有帮助、有用处的。
    本书有两个优点。第一，它把列宁的丰富而分散的言论归纳为几个主要问题，如辩证法问题、认识论问题、辩证逻辑问题以及辩证法、认识论和逻辑学三者的统一问题等，加以系统的论述。因此，重点比较突出，初读“哲学笔记”的同志可以由此获得遵循的线索。第二，本书把“哲学笔记”中的思想同列宁前期和后期的理论活动和革命实践活动联系起来作了考察，通过这样的介绍，我们能较深刻地理解列宁的哲学思想的发展过程以及它们的革命实践意义。
    本书共分九章。第一章概括介绍“哲学笔记”的内容和特点，说明列宁做哲学笔记时的历史背景，和列宁对马克思主义哲学的贡献。
    第二章系统地介绍黑格尔和费尔巴哈的学说以及列宁对他们的评价。黑格尔是马克思以前的杰出的辩证论者，他在唯心主义基础上表述了辩证法的基本原则。列宁对黑格尔哲学非常重视，“哲学笔记”中就有三篇关于黑格尔著作的摘记，列宁特别详尽地摘录了黑格尔的“逻辑学”，并写了许多重要的批语。但黑格尔的著作有许多地方充满着神秘主义，晦涩难懂，列宁在读“逻辑学”中的“主观性”一篇时，也不禁这样写道：“这部著作的这些部分应当叫做：引起头痛的最好办法！”本书第二章首先对黑格尔的哲学体系作系统介绍，使我们对于黑格尔哲学有全面的了解，这样也就容易了解列宁摘录的黑格尔的片断言论以及列宁对黑格尔的批判。其次，本章指出了黑格尔哲学的合理内核，批判了它的神秘主义，这样就可以帮助我们分辨黑格尔哲学的是非，不致受黑格尔唯心主义迷惑，也不致随意抛弃黑格尔的合理内核。第二章中还系统地论述了马克思以前的杰出的唯物主义者费尔巴哈的哲学，批判了他的直观唯物主义的局限性，这对于研究列宁关于费尔巴哈的“宗教本质讲演录”和“莱布尼茨”两书的摘要，无疑地也是有帮助的。
    第三章着重介绍“哲学笔记”中的辩证法问题。列宁在“哲学笔记”中就辩证法问题提出了许多天才的见解，他特别注意对立面的统一和斗争规律，认为它是辩证法的核心和实质。本书的作者围绕着辩证法的三个规律，即对立面的统一和斗争，量变到质变的转化、否定的否定，来阐明列宁对辩证法的发展，同时还阐明了对立面的统一和斗争规律的具体内容，指出为什么这个规律是辩证法的核心和实质。作者认为，对立面的统一和斗争规律揭示了现实界一切事物的运动的来源，因此它是理解飞跃，即理解量变到质变的转化规律的钥匙；同时，它也是理解旧东西死亡和新东西产生，即理解否定的否定规律的钥匙，从这个意义上说，对立面的统一和斗争规律是辩证法的核心。作者还逐条分析了列宁提出的辩证法的十六要素。
    认识论问题一向是列宁注意的中心，列宁继“唯物主义和经验批判主义”之后，在“哲学笔记”中又创造性地发展了马克思主义的认识论。本书第四章较通俗地介绍了列宁对认识过程的辩证性、主观能动性、唯心主义认识论根源等重要问题的看法，详尽地分析了列宁指出的“从生动的直观到抽象的思维，并从抽象的思维到实践”这一认识客观现实的辩证过程，批判了对实践在认识过程中的作用的糊涂观点，指出实践不只是认识的第三阶段，而且是认识的来源和基础，它贯串在整个认识过程中。本章还探讨了列宁的一个重要指示：要建立正确的认识论，必须从哲学上总结各门科学的发展史、儿童和动物的智力发展史、语言发展史等等。
    第五章着重探讨列宁在“哲学笔记”中如何给辩证逻辑下定义以及如何规定辩证逻辑的内容和结构。作者批判了苏联某些逻辑家否定辩证逻辑的错误企图，证明列宁也像恩格斯一样，肯定有两种逻辑的存在，一种是形式逻辑，一种是辩证逻辑。作者透辟地分析了列宁提出的有关辩证逻辑的天才指示。这些分析对于我们深入领会列宁的指示，解决目前我国学术界有关形式逻辑和辩证逻辑的争论，有很大的参考价值。
    作者接着在第六章中揭示了列宁提出的关于辩证法、认识论和逻辑学相统一的重要原理。列宁的这一原理在过去没有得到哲学界应有的重视和深入的研究。本书对这一原理的阐述是富有启发性的。作者提出了自己对这一原理的看法，认为：认识论是唯物主义辩证法在解释认识过程中的运用，而辩证逻辑是唯物主义辩证法在解释逻辑认识（理性认识）过程中的运用，从这个意义上来说，辩证法、认识论和逻辑学三者是统一的。但是，它们不是彼此可以抵消的东西，它们是辩证唯物主义这门科学的不同表现形式，各自履行着特殊的职能。
    第七章专门介绍“谈谈辩证法问题”这篇短文。这是列宁的天才的哲学著作，是列宁在辩证法方面的研究工作的总结，它把唯物主义辩证法提高到了新的阶段。本章的介绍给我们研究这篇作品指点了门径。
    第八章主要介绍“哲学笔记”中的哲学史问题。作者论述列宁在“哲学笔记”中给哲学史研究工作者提出的方法论原则、党性原则以及列宁给黑格尔的哲学史观的评价，阐明列宁如何站在战斗唯物主义的立场上，批判地对待马克思以前的哲学。
    最后一章指出了列宁如何在1915年以后写的著作中进一步发展“哲学笔记”中提出的理论以及如何用这些理论去指导革命实践。例如，列宁用“哲学笔记”中提出的普遍和特殊不可分割的原理分析了复杂的社会现象，做出了一个具有重要实践意义的结论：“一切民族都将走到社会主义，这是不可避免的，但是走法并不完全一样，在民主的形式上，在无产阶级专政的形式上，在社会生活各方面的社会主义改造的速度上，每个民族都会有自己的特点。”在“帝国主义是资本主义发展的高级阶段”一书中，列宁通过对资本主义矛盾的分析进一步发展了“哲学笔记”中提出的矛盾学说。列宁在反对布哈林在职工会问题上的折衷主义立场时，向前发展了辩证逻辑，分析了形式逻辑和辩证逻辑的关系。提出了辩证逻辑的四个要求。作者还论述了“哲学笔记”和“论战斗唯物主义的意义”一文之间的联系，这篇文章，苏联哲学界认为是列宁留给他们的遗嘱，它的内容很接近“哲学笔记”，“哲学笔记”中的许多论点在这篇文章中得到了进一步的发展。通过本章的生动的阐述，我们可以清楚地看到，列宁的思想是具有创造性的革命活动的指南。
    以上就是本书的基本内容。
    列宁的“哲学笔记”是哲学思想的宝库，其中丰富的哲学遗产要我们通过独立思考去发掘。“关于列宁的‘哲学笔记’”一书，可以启发初学者对“哲学笔记”中的若干重要理论问题的认识，帮助初学者去深入地研究列宁的这部著作。
