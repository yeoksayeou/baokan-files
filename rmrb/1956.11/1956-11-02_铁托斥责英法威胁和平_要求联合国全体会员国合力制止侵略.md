Xinhua News Agency, Belgrade, November 1st—TASS reports: The Yugoslav News Agency broadcast a statement by Yugoslav President Tito regarding the Near East situation.

The statement said that Israel's open aggression against Egypt in the Near East has resulted in a state of war, which has the potential to escalate into a larger-scale war with unpredictable consequences.

Yesterday, Britain and France, under the pretext of protecting the region from the Israeli invasion of Egyptian territory, threatened to send troops to the Suez Canal Zone in the form of an ultimatum. However, this is not a step to counter Israeli aggression, nor is it a measure to protect the canal from aggression. If things really get to this point, then, on the contrary, it is a continuation of this act of aggression.

The statement also said that it must be emphasized that the British and French governments did not wait for the United Nations to take measures before announcing their unilateral decision, and even disrupted the work of the Security Council, which was meeting to discuss this issue in order to make a decision.

It is regrettable and may lead to tragic consequences that at a time when governments should be working towards a peaceful resolution of many major issues, this new and dangerous situation has emerged, and some are trying to exploit it to achieve their selfish goals.

If this aggression is not stopped through the joint efforts of all members of the United Nations, it will have far-reaching consequences for the cause of peace in the Near East. Today, problems such as the Suez Canal cannot and must not be resolved by force. Therefore, the world reasonably hopes that the United Nations and all its member states, in the long-term interests of international friendship, will condemn this aggression and threat, take all possible measures to prevent the outbreak of war, and restore humanity's confidence in the possibility of maintaining peace and establishing international cooperation.

### 铁托斥责英法威胁和平  要求联合国全体会员国合力制止侵略

    铁托斥责英法威胁和平
    要求联合国全体会员国合力制止侵略
    新华社1日讯　据塔斯社贝尔格莱德10月31日讯：南斯拉夫通讯社播发了南斯拉夫总统铁托关于近东局势的声明。
    声明说，以色列在近东公开对埃及进行侵略，因此产生战争状态，这种状态有变为更大规模战争的可能，而其后果和结局是不能预料的。
    英国和法国昨天借口保护这一地区免受以色列入侵埃及国土的影响，以最后通牒形式威胁将派兵进驻苏伊士运河地带。但是，这不是抵制以色列侵略的步骤，也不是保护运河免受侵略的措施。假如事情果真弄到这种地步，那末，恰恰相反，它是这种侵略行为的继续。
    声明还说，必须着重指出，英国和法国政府没有等到联合国采取措施就宣布了它们的片面决定，并且甚至竟破坏开会讨论这个问题以便作出决定的安全理事会的工作。
    令人感到遗憾并且可能导致悲惨后果的是，在各国政府应当致力和平解决许多重大问题的时候，竟然出现了这种新的危险局势，某些人正在力图利用这种局势来达到他们自私自利的目的。
    如果这种侵略不通过联合国全体会员国的共同努力来加以制止，它就会对近东的和平事业产生深远的后果。在今天，不能，也不容许以武力解决像苏伊士运河这类问题。因此，全世界合理地希望：联合国和所有各个会员国能本着国际友谊的长远利益，谴责这种侵略和威胁，采取一切可能的措施，阻挡战争的发生，恢复人类对维护和平和建立国际合作的可能性的信心。
