    Xinhua News Agency, November 29th, Dispatch from TASS, Paris, November 28th: "l'Humanité" published a statement from the Central Political Bureau of the French Communist Party regarding the renewal of party membership cards and the movement to expand and strengthen the party ranks in 1957. The statement said that despite the difficulties, the path to uniting the working class to achieve the guarantees they received on the eve of the parliamentary elections remains open.

    The Political Bureau pointed out that over 52,000 new members had joined the party this year, and 1,550 new party branches had been established. In November alone, when the anti-communist movement in France was particularly rampant, more than 1,000 people joined the party.

    The Political Bureau called on all party activists and all party organizations to launch a movement to strengthen the party ranks, because the strength and achievements of party activities can guarantee the restoration of peace in Algeria through negotiations, consolidate peace in the Suez Canal region and the world, meet the demands of the working people in urban and rural areas, and ensure the victory of the democratic and national aspirations of the French people.

    The statement also emphasized that the French Communist Party has been and will remain a tireless organizer of a united front of Socialists and Communists, and that the establishment of this united front can broadly unite national and democratic forces and guarantee the dignity of France and the happiness of the French people.

    政治局指出，在今年就有五万二千多新党员入党，新建立了一千五百五十个党支部。仅仅在11月，在法国反共运动特别猖獗的时候，就有一千多人加入了党的队伍。
    政治局号召所有党的积极分子和所有党的组织掀起一个加强党的队伍的运动，因为党活动的力量和成果可以保证通过谈判的方式恢复阿尔及利亚的和平，巩固苏伊士运河地区和全世界和平，满足城乡劳动人民的要求，以及使法国人民民主和民族的愿望得到胜利。
    声明中还强调指出，法国共产党过去是，将来仍然是社会党人和共产党人统一战线不倦的组织者，建立这个统一战线就能够广泛团结民族和民主力量，保证法兰西的尊严和法国人民的幸福。
