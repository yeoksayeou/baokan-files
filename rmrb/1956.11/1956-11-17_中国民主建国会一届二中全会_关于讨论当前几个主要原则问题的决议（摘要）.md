Xinhua News Agency, 16th: The Second Plenary Session of the First Central Committee, China Democratic National Construction Association, which closed today, adopted a resolution on discussing several major principles issues currently.

The resolution stated that the meeting fully discussed two issues of great practical significance for determining the current work policy and tasks of the association: the assessment of the current national bourgeoisie of China and the relationship between the working class and the national bourgeoisie. The meeting reached the following conclusions on these two issues:

First, on the issue of assessing the current national bourgeoisie of China.

The resolution pointed out that in the discussion on the duality of the current national bourgeoisie of China, the meeting affirmed that after the overall public-private partnership of capitalist industry and commerce, the duality of the Chinese national bourgeoisie still exists. The meeting believes that the duality of the Chinese national bourgeoisie has its different contents and manifestations with the development of each stage of the Chinese people's revolution. As long as the national bourgeoisie still exists as an exploiting class, its duality will inevitably still exist. However, this duality is not fixed. Over the past seven years, especially since the "Five-Anti Campaign," the positive side of this duality has been continuously growing and expanding, and the negative side has been continuously decreasing and shrinking. If we do not face up to this objective fact and subjectively exaggerate any one side of it, or even deny the other side, we will commit a principled error.

After the founding of the People's Republic of China, the main contradiction in the country was the contradiction between the working class and the bourgeoisie. During this period, the duality of the bourgeoisie, as pointed out in the political report made by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to the Eighth National Congress of the CPC, was that on the one hand, it expressed support for the people's democratic dictatorship, the Common Program, and the Constitution, and expressed its willingness to continue to oppose imperialism and support land reform; but on the other hand, it had a strong desire to develop capitalism. Economically, capitalist industry and commerce has two aspects: on the one hand, it has a positive role that is beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, and on the other hand, it has a negative role that is detrimental to the national economy and the people's livelihood.

After the overall public-private partnership, due to the fundamental changes in the original capitalist relations of production in enterprises, the contradiction between the bourgeoisie and the working class has been basically resolved. Therefore, the content of the duality of the bourgeoisie has also undergone significant changes, and the positive side of the bourgeoisie has become the main side. This positive aspect is mainly that industrialists and businessmen have become public officials of public-private joint ventures. Although they still have class relations with the working class, they have begun to establish socialist cooperative relationships. Their useful production technologies and business experience have become valuable assets of the country. They actively participated in socialist competitions and strived to complete the country's first five-year plan. However, because fixed interest still exists, the capitalist ownership of the means of production has not been finally eliminated, and ideological remolding is lagging behind the development of the objective situation, the negative side of the bourgeoisie still exists. This negative side is mainly: the ideological and behavioral patterns that are unfavorable to the gradual elimination of exploitation, which must be overcome in the process of implementing fixed interest until the final elimination of exploitation; the ideological style of capitalist management and administration, which must be gradually overcome in the process of implementing public-private partnership to state-owned enterprises; the ideological and behavioral patterns that look down on labor, which must be gradually overcome in the process of gradually transforming from exploiting class elements to self-reliant laborers; and other ideological and behavioral patterns that are not conducive to cooperating with public cadres, building the cause of socialism, or even resisting socialist transformation.

The resolution stated that the correct analysis of the current duality of the Chinese national bourgeoisie is essentially a correct assessment of the social status of the Chinese national bourgeoisie in today's China, which has a positive guiding significance for determining the association's future work policy and tasks. If we do not recognize that the positive side of the national bourgeoisie has become the main side today, it will be detrimental to the current socialist cause; but if we therefore believe that it is not necessary to point out that the national bourgeoisie still has a negative side today, it is not only inconsistent with reality, but also harmful to the further education and transformation of the national bourgeoisie elements, and further promoting their enthusiasm for production and operation, which is also detrimental to our country's socialist transformation and socialist construction.

The resolution also said that it should be pointed out that this idea and statement of denying or not mentioning that the Chinese national bourgeoisie still has its negative side will inevitably blur the distinction between the current national bourgeoisie and the working class in practice, thereby making people ignore the current class contradictions and class struggle; this will be sufficient to affect the efforts of national bourgeoisie elements to transform themselves and hinder their progress.

Second, on the issue of the relationship between the working class and the national bourgeoisie.

The resolution said that the meeting believes that the correct assessment of the current Chinese national bourgeoisie is not only related to the issue of the further socialist transformation of the Chinese national bourgeoisie elements, but also inevitably related to the correct handling of the relationship between the bourgeoisie and the working class, that is, after the long-term coexistence and mutual supervision policy is proposed, the issue of understanding the leadership of the working class and its vanguard, the Communist Party of China.

The resolution stated that the Communist Party of China has put forward the policy of long-term coexistence and mutual supervision between the Communist Party and various democratic parties, which shows that our country's socialist democratic system has been further developed. As one of China's democratic parties, the association feels greatly encouraged and excited by the determination of this policy.

The meeting believes that the long-term coexistence and mutual supervision policy put forward by the Communist Party of China must not be understood as having any essential similarities with the "democratic politics" under any capitalist system. Therefore, any distortion of this policy that deviates from socialist principles is harmful. However, it must also be pointed out that although the Chinese national bourgeoisie must accept the leadership of the working class politically, the national bourgeoisie elements and the working class members are equal in legal status today. They have full political freedom within the scope of the Constitution and under socialist principles. The association represents the legitimate interests of the national bourgeoisie. In order to further assist the Communist Party of China and the government in thoroughly completing the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce and actively contributing to socialist construction, the association's organizations at all levels and all members should be more modest and prudent, redouble their efforts, and improve their work under the long-term coexistence and mutual supervision policy put forward by the Communist Party of China; criticize and make suggestions on the shortcomings and errors in the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the work of the state, and supervise the Communist Party of China with a proactive attitude, while also accepting its supervision. Doing so is not only not contradictory to the national bourgeoisie's need to accept the leadership of the working class and its vanguard, the Communist Party of China, but also more conducive to strengthening the leadership of the Communist Party of China. Because this is precisely the specific manifestation of the national bourgeoisie, which the association mainly represents, faithfully accepting the leadership of the Communist Party of China and implementing the long-term coexistence and mutual supervision policy.

The meeting believes that the correct understanding of the above two issues has great guiding significance for the association's current work policy and tasks. The meeting agreed with the opinion of the Standing Committee of the Central Committee, that is, the different views on these principled issues are no longer a purely theoretical difference in understanding, but an issue involving how to implement the association's political line, which has principled differences.

To this end, the meeting resolved that the Standing Committee of the Central Committee should strengthen its attention to political principles issues in the future, and earnestly discuss them within the association to unify understanding, strengthen unity, and improve work.

### 中国民主建国会一届二中全会  关于讨论当前几个主要原则问题的决议（摘要）

    中国民主建国会一届二中全会
    关于讨论当前几个主要原则问题的决议
    （摘要）
    新华社16日讯　今天闭幕的中国民主建国会第一届中央委员会第二次全体会议，通过了关于讨论当前几个主要原则问题的决议。
    决议说，会议充分讨论了对于决定本会当前的工作方针任务具有极大现实意义的两个问题。关于当前中国民族资产阶级的估价问题以及关于工人阶级和民族资产阶级的关系问题。会议对这两个问题作出了如下的结论：
    第一、关于当前中国民族资产阶级的估价问题。
    决议指出，在关于当前中国民族资产阶级两面性问题的讨论上，会议肯定了在资本主义工商业全行业公私合营后，中国民族资产阶级的两面性还是存在的。会议认为：中国民族资产阶级的两面性，是随着中国人民革命各阶段的发展，而有其不同的内容和表现形式的。只要民族资产阶级还作为一个剥削阶级而存在的时候，它的两面性也必然还是存在的。但这种两面性不是固定不变的，七年以来，特别是自从“五反”以后，这种两面性中积极的一面在不断地增长和扩大，消极的一面在不断地减少和缩小。我们如果不正视这种客观事实，而主观地把它的任何一面加以夸大，甚至否定其另一面，就将犯原则上的错误。
    在中华人民共和国成立以后，国内的主要矛盾是工人阶级同资产阶级之间的矛盾。这时期，资产阶级的两面性，正如中国共产党中央委员会向中共第八次全国代表大会所作的政治报告中所指出的：一方面是表示拥护人民民主专政，拥护共同纲领和宪法，表示愿意继续反对帝国主义，赞成土地改革；但是，另一方面又有发展资本主义的强烈愿望。在经济上，资本主义工商业具有两方面的作用，一方面具有有利于国计民生的积极作用，一方面具有不利于国计民生的消极作用。
    在全行业公私合营以后，由于企业原来的资本主义生产关系发生了根本性的变化，资产阶级与工人阶级的矛盾已经基本上解决，因此，资产阶级两面性的内容也就有了重大的变化，资产阶级的积极的一面已成为主要的一面。这积极的一面主要是：工商业者已经成为公私合营企业的公职人员，他们虽然同工人阶级还存在着阶级关系，但已开始建立了社会主义的合作共事关系，他们的有益的生产技术和业务经验，已经成为国家的宝贵财富，他们积极参加了社会主义竞赛，为完成国家的第一个五年计划而努力。但是由于定息还存在，生产资料的资本主义所有制还没有最后消灭，而且思想改造还落后于客观形势的发展，因此资产阶级的消极一面也还是存在的。这种消极的一面，主要是：在实行定息办法到最后消灭剥削的过程中所必须克服的不利于逐步消灭剥削的思想行为，在企业实行公私合营到企业国有化的过程中所必须逐步克服的资本主义经营管理的思想作风，在由剥削阶级分子逐步转变为自食其力的劳动者的过程中所必须逐步克服的轻视劳动的思想行为，以及其他不利于同公方干部合作共事、建设社会主义事业、乃至与接受社会主义改造有抵触的思想行为。
    决议说，对于当前中国民族资产阶级两面性的正确的分析，实质上就是对中国民族资产阶级在今天中国的社会地位作正确的估价，这对于决定本会今后的工作方针和任务，具有积极的指导意义。如果我们在今天不认识民族资产阶级的积极一面已成为主要的一面，那是会对当前的社会主义事业不利的；但如果我们竟因此认为可以不指出民族资产阶级今天还存在消极一面，这不仅与现实不符，而且还有害于民族资产阶级分子的进一步接受教育和改造，进一步发挥其生产经营的积极性，对于我们国家的社会主义改造和社会主义建设也是不利的。
    决议还说，应当指出这种否定或者不提中国民族资产阶级还有其消极的一面的想法和说法，在实际上必然会模糊当前民族资产阶级与工人阶级之间的区别，从而使人忽略当前的阶级矛盾和阶级斗争；这将足以影响民族资产阶级分子自我改造的努力，阻碍着他们的进步。
    第二、关于工人阶级与民族资产阶级的关系问题。
    决议说，会议认为：对于当前中国民族资产阶级的正确估价，不仅关系着中国民族资产阶级分子进一步接受社会主义改造问题，而且也必然关系着资产阶级与工人阶级之间的关系的正确处理问题，也就是在长期共存互相监督的方针提出后，对于接受工人阶级及其先锋队中国共产党的领导的认识问题。
    决议说，中国共产党提出了共产党和各民主党派长期共存、互相监督的方针，这表明了我国社会主义的民主制度已经有了进一步的发展。作为中国民主党派之一的本会，对于这一方针的确定，感到莫大的鼓舞和兴奋。
    会议认为：对于中国共产党提出的长期共存、互相监督的方针，决不能理解为与任何资本主义制度下的“民主政治”有什么本质上相同之处。因此，任何离开了社会主义原则的对这一方针的曲解，都是有害的。但也必须指出：中国民族资产阶级虽在政治上必须接受工人阶级的领导，民族资产阶级分子与工人阶级成员今天在法律上的地位是平等的。他们在宪法范围内和社会主义原则下有充分的政治自由。我会代表民族资产阶级的合法利益，为了进一步协助中国共产党和政府彻底完成对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造并在社会主义建设中积极贡献力量，我会各级组织和所有成员，在中国共产党提出的长期共存、互相监督的方针下，更应谦虚谨慎，加倍努力，改进工作；对中国共产党的领导和国家工作中所存在的缺点和错误，进行批评，提出建议，以积极主动的态度，对中国共产党进行监督，同时亦接受其监督。这样做，不仅与民族资产阶级必须接受工人阶级及其先锋队中国共产党的领导没有矛盾，而且更有利于加强中国共产党的领导。因为这正是本会所主要代表的民族资产阶级忠诚接受中国共产党的领导，贯彻长期共存、互相监督方针的具体表现。
    会议认为，对以上两个问题的正确认识，对本会当前的工作方针和任务具有重大的指导意义。会议同意中央常务委员会的意见，即关于这些原则性问题的不同看法，已经不是一个纯粹理论问题上的不同认识，而是一个牵涉到如何贯彻本会的政治路线，带有原则性的不同看法的问题。
    为此，会议决议：中央常务委员会今后应加强对政治原则问题的重视，在会内认真讨论，以统一认识，加强团结，改进工作。
