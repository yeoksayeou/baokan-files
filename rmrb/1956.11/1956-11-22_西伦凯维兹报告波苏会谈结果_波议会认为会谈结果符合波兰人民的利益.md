Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, November 21st: The tenth session of the Polish People's Republic Parliament concluded on November 20th.

At the closing session, deputies heard a report by Polish Council of Ministers Chairman Józef Cyrankiewicz on the results of the Moscow talks by the delegation of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party and the government.

In his report, Cyrankiewicz first spoke of the importance of the joint Polish-Soviet statement. He said that it appeared to be a statement of great importance to relations between socialist countries and that it represented an important step forward in implementing the propositions put forward by the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Obviously, all this was not formed overnight, and its formation was not without contradictions and obstacles, but every step taken on this path brings us closer to our goal.

Cyrankiewicz pointed out that the Moscow talks were conducted from beginning to end on the basis of recognizing sovereignty and complete equality of rights. The situation was exactly the same in the economic sphere. He said that our views were fully recognized. As for our economic debts caused by the failure to recognize the equal rights of both sides in the past, they have now been completely written off. I can say with full responsibility that as a result of the Moscow talks, the problem of the difference in our economic relations with the Soviet Union in the previous period has been completely resolved. Our present and future relations have been determined to be based on the principle of mutual benefit.

Cyrankiewicz then spoke about the issues resolved during the Moscow talks. He raised two basic issues: the settlement of financial accounts closely related to Poland's economic relations with the past, and Poland's access to a considerable amount of loans for the Five-Year Plan period. He said that the Soviet comrades considered the agreement on the first issue as a step towards clearing the way for friendly relations between the two countries. Everything that has cast a shadow on our mutual economic relations in the past and is incompatible with the form of socialist international cooperation has now been eliminated.

Of the large amount of credit loans granted to us by the Soviet Union in the past few years, the amount used by Poland up to November 1 this year can be exempted from repayment. This would exempt us from repaying more than two billion rubles between 1957 and 1965, an amount equivalent to more than 500 million U.S. dollars, which would give Poland a financial benefit, completely compensating Poland for the losses it suffered from the supply of coal under the agreement of August 16, 1945.

Cyrankiewicz also spoke about the resolution of some other financial accounts issues, saying that it is currently difficult to accurately determine the amount of money we will receive after we have jointly determined the amount that should be paid to us. In any case, this amount will greatly alleviate the tension in our foreign trade balance.

Cyrankiewicz then said that although our debts have been written off and other disputed financial accounts have been settled, our income and expenditure will still be in deficit between 1957 and 1960, and therefore, it will not be possible to fully guarantee the completion of the basic tasks of this Five-Year Plan. We explained this situation to our Soviet comrades. They expressed great understanding of the economic difficulties our country is currently encountering. The Soviet government agreed to help us overcome these difficulties.

Referring to the issue of the temporary stationing of Soviet troops on Polish territory, Cyrankiewicz pointed out that this was mainly due to the growing danger of the revival of German militarism, the constant attacks by revanchist forces on the correctness of Poland's western border, and the somewhat deteriorating international situation. The stationing of Soviet troops on Polish territory will never infringe upon Polish sovereignty and will not mean interference in our country's internal affairs.

Cyrankiewicz said that the fate of this country is in the hands of all the people today. No one will interfere in our affairs; on the contrary, we are now fully responsible for further developing our country and making all the people happy. All of this is in the hands of all the people.

Cyrankiewicz finally emphasized that the socialist cause and the cause of sovereignty have now been unshakably consolidated in Poland.

The meeting then adopted a resolution on the above report. The resolution pointed out that the direction and results of the talks held in Moscow are fully in line with the interests of the Polish people and in line with the will and aspirations that the Polish people have expressed in their unanimous support for the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the United Workers' Party.

Finally, Speaker of the Parliament Dambowski delivered a speech on the expiration of the term of the current parliament, saying that in the first half of the term of the current parliament, the supervision of the state power organs and government agencies by the parliament was restricted. The turning point in the work of the parliament occurred during the sixth session in March and April 1955. The inquiries raised by the deputies are an important weapon for the parliament to supervise the activities of the government. During the term of the current parliament, deputies have raised a total of sixty-six inquiries.

    西伦凯维兹报告波苏会谈结果
    波议会认为会谈结果符合波兰人民的利益
    据新华社华沙21日电　波兰人民共和国议会第十次会议在11月20日闭幕。
    在闭幕会议上，议员们听取了波兰部长会议主席西伦凯维兹所作的波兰统一工人党中央委员会和政府代表团关于莫斯科会谈结果的报告。
    西伦凯维兹在报告中首先谈到了波苏会谈联合声明的重要意义。他说，看来，这是对社会主义国家之间的关系具有极大的重要性的声明，而且，它在履行苏联共产党第二十次代表大会所提出的主张方面向前跨进了重要的一步。显然，所有这一切并不是一夜之间形成的，其形成过程中并不是没有矛盾和障碍的，但是在这条道路上走的每一步都使我们更接近于我们的目标。
    西伦凯维兹指出，莫斯科会谈自始至终是在承认主权和权利完全平等的基础上进行的。在经济方面的情况也完全是这样。他说，我们的观点得到了充分的承认。至于由于过去时期不承认双方权利平等所造成的我们的经济上的债务，现在已经全部勾销了。我可以完全负责地说，由于莫斯科会谈的结果，我们在前一个时期同苏联的经济关系上的差额问题已经完全解决了。我们双方现在和将来的关系已经确定要以互利的原则作基础。
    西伦凯维兹接着谈到了在莫斯科会谈的过程中所解决的问题。他提出了两个基本问题：过去同波兰的经济关系有密切联系的财政帐目的结算，以及波兰获得用于五年计划时期的相当数量的贷款。他说，苏联同志认为，关于第一个问题的协议是为两国友好关系扫清道路的一个步骤。过去在我们相互的经济关系上投下阴影并且同社会主义国际合作形式不相称的一切东西现在已经消除了。
    在苏联过去几年内给予我们的大量信用贷款中，波兰到今年11月1日为止所动用的款项可以免于偿还。这就使我们不必在1957年到1965年间偿还二十多亿卢布，这个数目相当于五亿多美元，使波兰得到了财政上的利益，从而完全弥补了波兰根据1945年8月16日的协定因供应煤炭而受到的损失。
    西伦凯维兹还谈到了有关其他一些财政帐目问题的解决情况，他说，在目前要确切地说明在我们共同确定应该付给我们的款项以后我们将会得到的钱的数量是有困难的。无论如何，这笔数目将大大地解除我们的对外贸易平衡方面的紧张情况。
    西伦凯维兹随后说，尽管我们的债务一笔勾销了，尽管存在着争论的其他财政帐目也结清了，可是在1957年到1960年期间，我们的收支将仍然是入不敷出；因而也就不能够充分地保证这个五年计划的基本任务的完成。我们向我们的苏联同志说明了这个情况。他们表示非常理解我们国家现在正遇到的经济困难。苏联政府同意帮助我们克服这些困难。
    西伦凯维兹在谈到苏联军队暂时驻在波兰领土上的有关问题时指出，这主要是由于德国军国主义复活的日益增长的危险、复仇主义者的力量对波兰西部边境的正确性进行不断的攻击以及国际局势的某种程度的恶化。苏联军队驻在波兰领土上决不会侵犯波兰的主权，并且不会意味着对我们国家的内政的干涉。
    西伦凯维兹说，这个国家的命运今天是掌握在全国人民的手中。没有人会干涉我们的事务，相反的，现在我们完全自行负责，使我们的国家得到进一步发展，和使全国人民获得幸福。所有这一切都掌握在全国人民的手中。
    西伦凯维兹最后强调说，社会主义事业和主权事业现在已经在波兰无可动摇地巩固下来了。
    会议接着就上述报告通过了一项决议。决议指出，在莫斯科举行会谈的方针和结果是完全符合波兰人民的利益，符合波兰人民已在对统一工人党八中全会决议的一致支持上表现出来的意志和愿望。
    最后议会议长邓博夫斯基就本届议会任期届满发表了演说，他说，在本届议会的前一半时间内，议会对于国家权力机关和政府机构的监督是受到限制的。议会工作的转折点发生在1955年的3月和4月的第六次会议期间。议员提出的质询是议会监督政府活动的重要武器。在本届议会任期内，议员一共提出了六十六项质询。
