Xinhua News Agency, 31st - The Ministry of the Coal Industry completed its annual design task two and a half months ahead of schedule.

This year, the design tasks of this ministry have increased by nearly double compared with last year, with a total of 185 design projects, including 75 new mines, with a total design capacity of more than 40 million tons of coal per year. Other design projects include mechanical coal washing plants, mechanical repair shops, and mechanical manufacturing plants.

Due to the increased efficiency of design work this year, the situation in this ministry where design could not keep up with construction in the past has been greatly improved. From January to September this year, the drawings submitted by the design department on schedule or ahead of schedule accounted for 70.5% of the total drawings submitted, an increase of 18.1% compared with the same period last year. Therefore, conditions have been created for the preparation work of many projects and the on-time or early start of these projects.

The large-scale use of standard designs and the repeated use of drawings by various design institutes are the main factors for completing this year's design tasks ahead of schedule. The Director of the Design Bureau of the Ministry of Coal Industry said: Last year, orders were issued and systems were established, but the quantity of standard designs used and drawings reused only reached 17% of the total amount of construction drawing work. Older designers believed that using ready-made drawings did not show their technical skills, and new designers believed that doing so would not allow them to learn technology. This year, in the high tide of socialist transformation, the designers studied Premier Zhou's report on the issue of intellectuals and were greatly educated and encouraged, and those personal ideas were dispelled. In the first half of this year, the use of standard designs and reused drawings reached 58.5% of the construction drawing workload. The work efficiency of many auxiliary designers has also been surprisingly improved. Ma Ping, a female tracing team leader at the Shanghai Coal Mine Design Institute, created a multi-person tracing assembly line method, which increased tracing work efficiency by more than five times. In the two coal mine design institutes in Hankou and Chongqing, some typists improved the font panel based on the characteristics of coal mine design work, increasing the number of words typed per day from more than 2,000 to more than 20,000.

Although the design speed of this ministry has accelerated this year, the quality of the design is not entirely satisfactory. When designing a woodworking factory, some design institutes even applied the drawings of a water tower, making it completely irrelevant.

### 我国今年自己设计七十五个新矿井  煤炭工业部设计人员提前完成全年任务

    我国今年自己设计七十五个新矿井
    煤炭工业部设计人员提前完成全年任务
    新华社31日讯　煤炭工业部提前两个半月完成了全年的设计任务。
    今年这个部的设计任务，比去年增加了近一倍，共有一百八十五个设计项目；其中有新建矿井七十五个，按设计能力共年产四千多万吨煤。其它的设计项目为机械洗煤厂、机械修理厂和机械制造厂等。
    由于今年提高了设计工作的效率，这个部历年来设计赶不上施工的状况，有了很大改进。今年1到9月份设计部门按期交出或提前交出的图纸，占交出的图纸总数70.5％，比去年同期增加了18.1％。因此，为许多工程的准备工作和这些工程按期或提前开工创造了条件。
    各设计院大量地使用标准设计和重复利用图纸，是提前完成今年设计任务的主要因素。煤炭工业部设计总局局长说：去年下命令，定制度，结果使用标准设计和重复利用图纸的数量，只达到全部施工图工作量的17％。老的设计人员认为套用现成的图纸，表现不出自己的技术，新的设计人员认为这样做不能学到技术。今年设计人员在社会主义改造高潮中，学习了周总理所作的关于知识分子问题的报告，受到了很大的教育和鼓舞，那些个人的想法打消了。今年上半年使用标准设计和重复利用的图纸，达施工图工作量的58.5％。许多辅助设计人员的工作效率，也有了惊人的提高。上海煤矿设计院一个女描图组长马萍，创造了多人描图流水作业法，描图工作效率提高了五倍多。汉口和重庆的两个煤矿设计院，有的打字员根据煤矿设计工作的特点，改进了字盘，由每天打两千多字，提高到两万多字。
    这个部今年的设计速度虽然加快了，但是设计的质量却不尽令人满意。有的设计院在设计木工厂的时候，竟把水塔的图纸套用上去，弄得驴唇不对马嘴。
