    Advancing While Overcoming Difficulties
    ——A Record of Xinhui County's Relaxation of Market Management
    Wu Erxiang

    In the initial stage of opening the free market under state leadership in Xinhui County, Guangdong Province, new problems and new obstacles emerged almost every day. Only by taking timely and effective measures to solve these problems and eliminate these obstacles could this emerging market achieve healthy development.

    In the early stage of opening up, due to a lack of experience in this area and the absence of a set of systematic and specific measures, the approaches and steps taken by each district were inconsistent. Some opened up more, some opened up less, and some even included materials subject to state monopoly purchase and marketing within the scope of free trade. Cadres in the commercial sector had strong ideological resistance to opening up the free market. For example, the manager of the food company said, "The peasants are free, but we are not." A responsible cadre of a commercial bureau also said, "In the past, we were proactive and the peasants were passive; now the peasants are proactive and we are passive, making future work difficult." The head of a purchasing station in one district even said, "If we develop peasant trade, I will quit."

    In response to the above situation, the Xinhui County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, in order to unify the ideological understanding of cadres, personally led leading cadres of the commercial sector to visit the countryside, enabling them to see many unreasonable situations. For example, the cadres of the aquatic products company originally thought that it was a good experience to monopolize all marine fish, but after understanding the situation from the peasants, they realized that the marine fish produced by the peasants could originally be sold locally, but the aquatic products company had to collect it first and transport it back to Muzhou, and then small vendors bought it back from Muzhou for supply, increasing the cost by 8%. Jiujiang District is very close to Jiangmen City, and small native products could originally be transported directly to Jiangmen for sale, but the food company and supply and marketing cooperative insisted that the peasants sell them to the purchasing station in the district at the listed price, reducing the peasants' regional price difference income by 10%. As for the losses caused to peasants by underestimating grades and prices in the purchasing work, there were endless instances, and the peasants said to them, "If you continue to manage like this, we only have two paths to take: one is not to produce, and the other is not to obey your management." This made them realize that the commercial work had indeed lagged far behind the development of the situation and should be actively improved.

    On the other hand, in order to prevent market chaos, the County Committee, after investigation and research, further proposed five major measures for opening the free market under state leadership: First, classify agricultural and sideline products and adopt different management methods: strictly manage materials subject to unified purchase and marketing, and do not relax; for non-unified purchase materials, but large and important agricultural and sideline products needed by the state and the people, mainly control the source of goods by signing purchase contracts with agricultural cooperatives; general small agricultural and sideline products are allowed to be freely traded. Second, unreasonable prices should be reasonably adjusted; purchase and sale price differences should be minimized as much as possible; general small native products should not be marked with listed prices and are allowed to be freely negotiated. Third, state-owned and supply and marketing cooperatives should actively improve management and operation, and organize producers and consumers to meet directly to reduce intermediate links; local products are allowed to be freely purchased and sold by small vendors. Fourth, cancel regional blockades and implement free selection and purchase; cancel rigid matching and forced sales, and implement the policy of pricing according to quality; handicrafts can be purchased and sold independently. Fifth, widely sign contracts, control the source of goods through contracts, and specifically arrange production and market transactions.

    After the five major measures were implemented, the chaos in the early stage of the open market was reversed. However, new problems continued to arise: some agricultural and sideline products in short supply were rushed to purchase, and the market price was higher than the listed price, such as piglets with a listed price of 63 yuan per dan, but the market price was as high as 120 yuan; some rushed to purchase in neighboring counties, affecting the markets of neighboring counties, and some small vendors took the opportunity to raise and lower prices in the market. After discovering these situations, the County Committee also stipulated: it is not allowed to rush to purchase in neighboring counties; prevent speculative trading; calculate costs and do not blindly rush to purchase, and other three measures.

    From the perspective of the entire market situation, after the market was opened, prices were basically stable and there were no fluctuations; for some small products in short supply, the market price was higher than the listed price, the fundamental problem is that production cannot keep up with demand, which is temporarily unavoidable and normal.

    However, due to a lack of experience and insufficient attention, the timely handling of some problems was also affected. For example, some individual agricultural cooperatives saw that the market price was higher than the listed price and were unwilling to implement the original contract. After the market was opened, it was also found that some members of agricultural cooperatives were engaged in speculative trading and were not at ease with agricultural production. Due to insufficient management and education of small vendors, there were also cases of raising and lowering prices. These problems can be solved as long as attention is paid to them.

    在排除困难中前进
    ——记新会县放宽市场管理的经过
    吴尔祥
    广东省新会县开放国家领导下的自由市场的初期，差不多每天都有新的问题，新的障碍出现。经过及时采取有效措施解决这些问题，排除这些障碍，才使这个新兴的市场获得健康的发展。
    开放初期，由于缺乏这方面的工作经验，没有规定一套系统、具体的措施，因此，各区的做法和步骤都不一致。有的开放得多些，有的开放得少些，有的甚至把国家统购统销的物资也列入了自由买卖的范围。商业部门的干部对开放自由市场的思想抵触很大。比如食品公司经理说：“农民自由了，我们不自由了。”一个商业局的负责干部也说：“过去我们主动，农民被动；现在农民主动了，我们被动了，今后工作难做。”有一个区的收购站负责人甚至说：“如果开展农民贸易，我就不干了。”
    中共新会县委针对以上情况，为了统一干部的思想认识，由县委亲自带领商业部门的领导干部下乡访问，使他们看到了许多不合理的情况。比如：水产公司的干部原来还以为把海鱼全部包起来是个好经验，向农民了解后，才知道农民出产的海鱼，本来就可以在当地销售，但水产公司却要自己先收起来运回睦洲，再由小商贩从睦洲买回去供应，增加费用8％。九区距江门市很近，小宗土产本来可以直接运到江门去出售，食品公司和供销社却硬要农民按牌价卖给本区的收购站，使农民减少10％的地区差价收入。至于收购工作中的压级压价给农民造成的损失更是层出不穷，农民对他们说：“你们再这样管下去，我们只有两条路走：一条是不生产，另一条不服你们管。”这使他们认识到商业工作的确已远远落后于形势的发展，应当积极加以改进。
    另一方面，县委为了防止市场发生混乱，经过调查研究，又进一步提出了开放国家领导下的自由市场的五大措施：一、对农副业产品进行分类，采取分别管理的办法：对统购统销的物资，要严格管理不能放松；对非统购物资、但为国家和人民都需要的大宗、重要的农副产品，主要通过同农业社订立收购合同掌握货源；一般的小宗农副产品，允许自由买卖。二、价格不合理的应作合理调整；购销差价应尽量缩小；一般小宗土产不挂牌价，允许自由议价。三、国营、供销社应积极改进经营管理，组织生产者和消费者直接见面，以减少中间环节；地产地销的产品，准许小商贩自由购销。四、取消地区封锁，实行自由选购；取消硬性搭配和强迫买卖，贯彻执行按质论价的政策；手工业可以自购自销。五、广泛签订合同，通过合同掌握货源，具体安排生产和市场交易。
    五大措施贯彻下去后，开放市场初期的混乱情况扭转了过来。但是新的问题仍然不断出现：有些供不应求的农副产品发生抢购，市价比牌价高，比如小猪牌价是每担六十三元，市价却高达一百二十元；有的跑到邻县去抢购，影响邻县市场，有些小商贩在市场上乘机抬价压价。县委发现这些情况后，又规定：不准向邻县抢购；防止投机买卖；要计算成本，不要盲目抢购等三个措施。
    从整个市场情况来看，开放市场后，物价基本是稳定的，没有发生什么波动；某些供不应求的小宗产品，市价高过牌价，根本的问题是生产赶不上需要，暂时是不可避免的，也是正常的。
    但是，由于缺乏经验和注意不够，也影响到一些问题的及时处理。比如有个别农业社看到市价比牌价高，不愿执行原订的合同。市场开放后，也发现有些农业社社员从事投机买卖，不安心农业生产。由于对小商贩管理教育不够，抬价压价情况也有发现。这些问题只要加以注意，是有办法解决的。
