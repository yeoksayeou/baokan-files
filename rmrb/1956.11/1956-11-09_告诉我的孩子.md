    Tell My Child
    Guo Xiaochuan
    Child, I want to take you to a demonstration, even though you are only six years old. Holding your cold little hand, tears spring from my eyes. You were born in our republic, surrounded by friendship and peace. Have you ever dreamed that this world still has the blood and fire of war? Today, your father, who loves you most, must teach you to hate, not because I want to defile your pure heart, but for the sake of your future destiny. To be honest, you are already doing well! You are still by your father's side, while those Egyptian children are dying under the bombs of imperialism. Let's go, child, let's go! To shout, to be angry, to hate. When it is absolutely necessary, your father will also teach you to kill the enemy!
          Evening, November 3, 1956

    告诉我的孩子
    郭小川孩子，我要带你去示威，虽然你的年龄只有六岁。拉上你那冰凉的小手，我的眼睛就跳出两滴泪。你在我们共和国中诞生，周围是一片友谊和和平，可曾在梦里想到过吗？这世界还有血火的战争。今天，最爱孩子的爸爸不能不教你学会憎恨，并非我愿意玷污你纯洁的心灵，而是为了你未来的命运。说真的，你已经不错了！你还在你爸爸的身旁，而那些埃及的小朋友呀，却在帝国主义的炸弹下死亡。走吧，孩子，走吧！去呼喊，去愤怒，去憎恨。在迫不得已的时候，做爸爸的还要教你去杀敌人！
