Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 31st - According to the Fujian Daily: Large areas of submerged forests have been discovered in the inner sea near the dikes in Jinjiang, Xiamen, Haicheng, Yunxiao, Zhao'an and other places in Fujian Province. These forests are usually only visible from the sea as clumps of tree crowns; at low tide, the entire forest can be seen, with an estimated tens of millions of trees. Near Liaodong Village, Jinzhai Township, Guankou District, Tong'an County, there are nearly a thousand acres of submerged forest, with trees as high as four or five zhang [~13-16 meters].

According to investigations by the Fujian Provincial Forestry Department and local departments, these submerged forests are entirely composed of the subtropical mangrove species, Red Mangrove (Rhizophora stylosa). It is said that this tree species was brought back from Southeast Asia by overseas Chinese in 1882. Because the seeds of this tree are viviparous, when the seeds mature and fall into the sea, they drift with the tide to the shore and can naturally grow into forests. Therefore, they have developed extensively over the past few decades.

Red Mangroves flower and bear fruit twice a year (June and December) and take thirty years to mature. This tree can tolerate salt and grow in seawater, so it can protect embankments. This tree is also a good material for making utensils. The bark contains a large amount of tannin, which can be used as a dye and for tanning leather. The roots can also be used for medicinal purposes.

In addition to instructing relevant departments to protect the existing submerged forests, the Provincial Forestry Department plans to collect large quantities of seeds and use the tens of millions of existing seedlings to expand the planting of protective forest belts along the long coastline.

    福建沿海发现大批海底森林
    新华社福州31日电　据福建日报消息：在福建省晋江、厦门、海澄、云霄、诏安等地靠近堤岸的内海，发现有大片的海底森林。这些森林，平时只能从海面上看到丛丛的树冠；潮退时，可以看到森林的全貌，大约有几千万株。在同安县灌口区锦宅乡寮东村一带海岸，有近千亩的海底森林，树高达四、五丈。
    据福建省林业厅和当地有关部门调查，这些海底森林全属于亚热带森林红茄冬树种。据说，这种树是1882年华侨由南洋带回树种栽植的。由于这种树木的种子是胚生的，当种子成熟落在海里，随潮水飘流到岸滩上，便可自然地生长成林，因此，在过去的几十年间，获得大量发展。
    红茄冬每年开花结实两次（6月和12月），三十年才能成材。这种树木能耐咸和在海水中生长，所以能起防护堤岸的作用。这种树木又是制造器具的良好材料。树皮含有多量的鞣酸，可以作为染料和制革用。树根还可以作药用。
    省林业厅目前除责成有关部门保护好现有的海底森林外，还计划大量采集种子和利用现有几千万株的幼苗，在漫长的海岸线上扩大栽植防护林网。
