	All-Metal Saw Blade for Carding Machines
	A type of all-metal saw blade that can replace flexible card clothing for carding machines has been successfully trial-produced at the Qingdao Textile Machinery Factory and will soon be officially put into production.
	This all-metal saw blade is of good quality and can be used for carding yarn counts of 60 or less. When using this all-metal saw blade for carding, the amount of short fiber fluff accumulating on the base of the saw teeth is less than the amount accumulating on the base of the needles of flexible card clothing, which can greatly reduce the time spent stopping the machine to clean the needles. According to tests, when using flexible card clothing for carding, it is necessary to stop the machine approximately every two hours to clean the short fiber fluff accumulated on the card clothing; when using all-metal saw blades for carding, it is only necessary to clean it approximately every 100 hours. Because the downtime is reduced, using this saw blade for carding can increase production by approximately 15% compared to using flexible card clothing.
	In addition, this all-metal saw blade is made of domestically produced steel wire. If it is widely used, it can also save the country a large amount of foreign exchange spent on importing base fabric and fine steel wire for manufacturing flexible card clothing.

	New Brand Toothpaste
	More than 25,000 tubes of new brand high-grade toothpaste, on trial sale in the Shanghai market, were quickly snapped up. These are the three newest trial-produced toothpastes in Shanghai: "Dunhuang," "Wanli," and "Wintergreen Chlorophyll."
	"Dunhuang" toothpaste, trademarked with the famous Dunhuang flying apsaras murals, uses a foaming agent instead of the soap flakes that have been habitually used in domestic toothpaste for decades. It does not have the defects of ordinary toothpaste that easily irritate the mouth and damage the mucous membranes, has a strong cleaning ability, and also has a fruit fragrance that people love. This toothpaste, produced by the China Chemical Industry Society, which produces "White Jade" and "Samsung" toothpaste, was trial-produced by absorbing the advantages of foreign famous brand toothpaste. "Wanli" toothpaste, trial-produced by the Holley Pharmaceutical Company, has a similar formula to "Dunhuang" toothpaste, but it contains a different spearmint fragrance than the former. "Wintergreen Chlorophyll" toothpaste, with a light green paste, is made by the Central Chemical Industry Factory using chlorophyll as the main raw material and can prevent fermentation and remove bad breath in the mouth.
	These three high-grade toothpastes, trial-produced to meet new consumer demands, have tubes that are thicker and longer than ordinary toothpaste, with an increased capacity of approximately one-third. The three new products are now in mass production. (Xinhua News Agency)

  梳棉用的全金属锯条
    一种可以代替弹性针布装配在梳棉机上梳棉用的全金属锯条，在青岛纺织机械厂试制成功，并且即将正式投入生产。
    这种全金属锯条质量很好，六十支以下的纱支都可以用它梳棉。使用这种全金属锯条梳棉，由于锯齿根上积有的短花绒比弹性针布的针根上积有的短花绒少，停车抄针的时间可以大大减少。根据试验，使用弹性针布梳棉，平均每两小时左右就要停车清理一次积在针布上的短花绒；使用全金属锯条梳棉每一百小时左右清理一次就可以了。由于停台时间减少，使用这种锯条梳棉，产量可以比用弹性针布增加15％左右。
    另外，这种全金属锯条是用国产钢丝制造的，如果广泛使用，还可给国家节省为制造弹性针布而进口底布和细钢丝的大量外汇。

      新　牌　牙　膏
    在上海市场上试销的二万五千多支新牌高级牙膏，很快被争购一空。它们是上海最新试制的“敦煌”、“万里”和“冬青叶绿素”三种新牌牙膏。
    以著名的敦煌飞天壁画为商标的“敦煌”牙膏，用泡沫剂代替国产牙膏几十年来习贯采用的皂片，没有一般牙膏易于刺激口腔和破坏粘膜的缺陷，去垢能力强，还有人们喜爱的水果香味。这种牙膏，是出产“白玉”和“三星”牙膏的中国化学工业社吸取了外国名牌牙膏的优点试制的。好来药物公司试制的“万里”牙膏，配方和“敦煌”牙膏相仿，它含有同前者不同的留兰香味。膏体呈浅绿色的“冬青叶绿素”牙膏，是中央化学工业厂采用叶绿素作为主要原料做成的，能够防酵和去除口腔内的臭味。
    这三种适应消费者的新要求而试制的高级牙膏，软管都比一般的牙膏粗长，容量增加了约三分之一。三种新产品现在已经大批生产。（新华社）
