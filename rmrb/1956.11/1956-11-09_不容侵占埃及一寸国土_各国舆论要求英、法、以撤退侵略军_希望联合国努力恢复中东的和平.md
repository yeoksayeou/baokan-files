Xinhua News Agency, November 8th. TASS Damascus, November 7th: The Syrian National Peace Committee issued a statement, angrily condemning the imperialist aggression against the Egyptian people. The committee demanded an immediate end to the aggression and the withdrawal of foreign troops from Egyptian territory.

India
Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, November 8th: The "Hindustan Times" editorial today stated: "In this sense, the ceasefire must mean 'withdrawal,' not 'occupation.'" The newspaper demanded that "Britain, France and Israel should not be allowed to continue their occupation under the pretext of clearing obstacles from the canal."
The editorial also demanded that the United Nations must set an earliest possible date for Britain, France, and Israel to withdraw from Egypt, regardless of whether sufficient international forces can be obtained to replace them. The United Nations must take steps to make the aggressors compensate Egypt.

Britain
Xinhua News Agency, London, November 8th: The British "Daily Worker" wrote on November 7th: The government's agreement to a ceasefire in Egypt is a major political and moral victory for the people. It emphasized that "however, peace in the Middle East is far from stable." The "Daily Worker" advocated: "Everyone should not relax until the last British soldier withdraws from Egypt and the last reservist returns home – and strive for them to return home before Christmas."

Yugoslavia
Xinhua News Agency, November 8th. Tanjug, Belgrade: On November 8th, the Yugoslav "Politika" commentary pointed out that although the British and French aggressors have announced the cessation of their military operations against Egypt, the conflict in the Near East has not been resolved, the aggressors are still on Egyptian territory, threatening Egypt's independence and world peace.
"Politika" emphasized that if the United Nations wants to restore humanity's trust in its effectiveness, it must strive to exercise the rights conferred on it by the UN Charter and force French, British, and Israeli troops to withdraw from Egypt. Since Israel has shown provocative behavior in the past, and now has a tendency to create new complex situations, it is even more necessary to take strong measures.

Czechoslovakia
Xinhua News Agency, Prague, November 8th: "Red Right Newspaper" published a commentary on the 7th entitled "The Aggressors' Troops Must Leave Egypt," stating that the outcome of the ceasefire must not allow the invaders to stay in the Suez region again, nor can they re-establish a bridgehead to control Egypt and invade other Arab countries. The commentary pointed out that the United Nations' responsibility is to restore the Egyptian people's right to every inch of their territory, force the aggressors to return to their original places, and compensate the Egyptian people for all the losses they have suffered.

Japan
Xinhua News Agency, November 8th: Tokyo: Shichiro Hozumi, acting director of the International Bureau of the Japan Socialist Party, said yesterday that British and French troops should immediately withdraw from Egypt.
In his statement on the British and French announcement to accept the proposal for a ceasefire in Egypt, Hozumi pointed out that if British and French troops are stationed in Egyptian territory in some way in the future, it will only make the problem more and more complicated.

    不容侵占埃及一寸国土
    各国舆论要求英、法、以撤退侵略军
    希望联合国努力恢复中东的和平
    叙利亚
    新华社8日讯　塔斯社大马士革7日讯：叙利亚全国和平委员会发表声明，愤怒谴责对埃及人民进行帝国主义侵略。委员会要求立即停止侵略、外国军队撤出埃及领土。
    印度
    据新华社新德里8日电  “印度斯坦时报”今天的社论说：“从这一意义来说，停火必须是意味着‘撤退’，而不是‘占领’。”这家报纸要求不应该允许“英法以清除运河沉船的障碍为借口继续进行占领”。
    社论还要求联合国必须规定一个英国、法国和以色列必须从埃及撤退的尽早的日期，而不论是否能够得到充分的国际部队来替代他们。联合国必须采取步骤使侵略者给埃及以赔偿。
    英国
    据新华社伦敦8日电  11月7日英国“工人日报”写道：政府同意在埃及停火是人民在政治上和道义上的重大胜利。它强调说，“但是，中东的和平还远说不上是稳定的。”“工人日报”主张：“在最后一个英国士兵撤出埃及，最后一名后备役军人重回家乡以前，大家都不要松劲——而且还要争取他们在圣诞节以前回家。”
    南斯拉夫
    据新华社8日讯　据南斯拉夫通讯社贝尔格莱德讯：11月8日，南斯拉夫“政治报”的评论指出，虽然英、法侵略者已经宣布停止它们对埃及的军事行动，但是近东的冲突还没有解决，侵略者还依然留在埃及的领土上，并且威胁着埃及的独立和世界和平。
      “政治报”强调指出，联合国如果想恢复人类对它的效用的信任，它就必须努力行使联合国宪章赋与它的权利，迫使法国、英国和以色列军队撤出埃及。由于以色列过去已经有挑衅者的表现，而现在又有造成新的复杂局面之势，因此就更加有必要采取有力的措施。
    捷克斯洛伐克
    据新华社布拉格8日电　“红色权利报”7日以“侵略者的军队必须离开埃及”为题发表评论说，停火的结果决不可让入侵者又在苏伊士地区停留下来，也决不可让它们再一次建立控制埃及和侵略其他阿拉伯国家的桥头堡。评论指出，联合国的责任就是要恢复埃及人民对他们每一寸国土的权利，迫使侵略者退回到他们原来的地方，赔偿埃及人民所受到的一切损失。
    日本
    据新华社8日讯　东京消息：日本社会党国际局代理局长穗积七郎昨天发表谈话说，英法军队应该立刻撤出埃及。
    穗积七郎在他就英法宣布接受在埃及停火的建议这件事发表的谈话中指出，英法军队今后如果以某种方式驻扎在埃及领土，只会使问题愈来愈复杂。
