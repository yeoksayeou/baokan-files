    The Bloody Atrocities of Imperialism Cannot Intimidate the Heroic People
    The People in the Rear of Egypt Calmly Prepare to Repel the Invaders
    Many Workers Join the National Liberation Army; People are Busy Digging Gun Emplacements and Trenches
    Xinhua News Agency, 6th Dispatch from Cairo: The people in the rear of Egypt, during these difficult days of suffering from the cruel bombing by the British and French air forces, are showing composure and preparing to repel the invaders' attacks. On November 5th, although Cairo continued to be attacked by enemy aircraft, banks were still open as usual, and shops were also open as usual.

    Many workers have put down their original work and joined the National Liberation Army. Many young staff members went to nearby recruiting stations to sign up, preparing to receive training in militia organizations.

    All churches of the Coptic Orthodox Church held special religious ceremonies, praying for the victory of the Egyptian army in the "great war against the infamous imperialist aggression."

    Everywhere in Egypt, one can see people digging gun emplacements and trenches, preparing to resist the war.

    Newspaper opinions reflect the Egyptian people's confidence and determination to resist aggression.

    The "Evening News" on November 4th wrote: "We will fight to the last drop of blood," "We will fight for the long-term peace of our country... we will never tremble and retreat."

    The "Today's News" weekly wrote: "The enemy is trying to occupy our land stained with the blood of freedom martyrs, trying to tear down the Egyptian flag that we proudly raised in the Suez Canal five months ago. We are facing well-equipped invaders, but we believe that we will achieve final victory and completely crush the enemy. Our army is not just those regular troops, every Egyptian, whether male or female, will fulfill their obligations; every family will participate in guerrilla warfare; every street will establish combat squads; every village will also organize its own teams. Any sacrifice will surely pave the way for victory, and every drop of blood will strengthen the unity of the motherland."

    埃及后方人民沉着准备迎击侵略者
    许多工人参加民族解放军，人们忙着掘炮位挖壕沟
    新华社6日讯　开罗消息：埃及后方人民在遭受英法空军残酷轰炸的艰苦日子里，表现镇定，准备迎击侵略者的进攻。11月5日，开罗虽然继续不断地受到敌机的袭击，银行还是照常办公，商店也照常营业。
    许多工人放下了原来的工作，参加了民族解放军。不少青年职员到附近的征募站去报名，准备在民兵组织里接受训练。
    哥普特教派的所有教堂都举行特别宗教仪式，为埃及军队在“反对恶名昭彰的帝国主义侵略的伟大战争”中取得胜利而祈祷。
    在埃及各处都可以看到人们在挖掘炮位和壕沟，准备进行抗战。
    报纸舆论反映出埃及人民反抗侵略的信心和决心。
    11月4日的“晚报”写道：“我们将战到最后一滴血”，“我们要为我国的长期和平而战斗……我们绝不战栗和退却”。
    “今日消息”周刊写道：“敌人企图侵占我们染遍自由烈士鲜血的土地，企图扯下我们五个月以前骄傲地在苏伊士运河升起的埃及国旗。我们面临着装备优良的侵略者，但是我们相信，我们将取得最后胜利，并完全粉碎敌人。我们的军队不只是那些正规部队，每一个埃及人，不论是男是女，都将履行自己的义务；每个家庭都将参加游击战争；每条街道都将建立战斗小队；每个乡村也都将组织自己的队伍。任何牺牲都必定为胜利铺平道路，每一滴鲜血都会加强祖国的团结”。
