    Three Art Publications to be Launched Soon

    (Our dispatch) In addition to the existing national art publications "Fine Arts" monthly, "Cartoon" semi-monthly, and "Lianhuanhuabao" semi-monthly, "Printmaking" bi-monthly was launched this National Day. This publication is edited by an editorial committee composed of some printmakers from Beijing and Shanghai, and published by Shanghai People's Fine Arts Publishing House. After its launch, it was enthusiastically welcomed by readers nationwide who are concerned about printmaking creation and love printmaking art. The inaugural issue sold out shortly after publication and has now been reprinted.

    Recently, the People's Fine Arts Publishing House is also preparing to publish three art publications, "Chinese Painting," "Arts and Crafts," and "Sculpture," one after another. "Chinese Painting" is scheduled to be launched in January next year, and Ye Gongchuo, Qi Gong, Hu Peheng, and others have been hired to work as editors. "Arts and Crafts" and "Sculpture" are both quarterly publications and will be edited by editorial committees organized by arts and crafts artists and sculptors, respectively. (Yi Feng)

    三种美术刊物即将创刊
    本报讯　全国性的美术刊物，除原有的“美术”月刊、“漫画”半月刊和“连环画报”半月刊以外，今年国庆节又创刊了“版画”双月刊。这个刊物是由北京和上海的一部分版画家组成编辑委员会负责编辑，而由上海人民美术出版社出版的。创刊后得到全国关心版画创作和爱好版画艺术的读者的热烈欢迎，创刊号出版不久就卖完了，现在已经再版。
    最近，人民美术出版社还准备陆续出版“国画”、“工艺美术”和“雕塑”三种美术刊物。“国画”预定在明年1月创刊，已聘请叶恭绰、启功、胡佩衡等担任编辑工作。“工艺美术”和“雕塑”都是季刊，将分别由工艺美术家和雕塑家组织编辑委员会负责编辑。（一风）
