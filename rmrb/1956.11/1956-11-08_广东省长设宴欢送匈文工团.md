Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, November 7th: The Hungarian People's Army Art Troupe concluded its performances in Guangzhou and left Guangzhou by special train this morning for Wuhan.

After arriving in Guangzhou on October 29th, the Hungarian People's Army Art Troupe gave eleven brilliant performances for Guangzhou citizens and the People's Liberation Army's land, sea, and air forces stationed in Guangzhou, with an audience of over 33,000 people. Their performances were warmly welcomed and appreciated by the audience.

Before the Hungarian People's Army Art Troupe left Guangzhou, Tao Zhu, Governor of Guangdong Province, hosted a banquet to bid them farewell. In his speech at the banquet, Governor Tao Zhu expressed his gratitude to the Hungarian People's Army Art Troupe for their performances in Guangzhou and expressed his deep sympathy for the recent unfortunate events suffered by the Hungarian people. He raised his glass to congratulate the Hungarian working people and all patriots on the great victory they achieved in the struggle against the counter-revolutionaries. When Governor Tao Zhu spoke, all members of the Hungarian Art Troupe responded with warm applause.

Major Melek Laszlo, head of the Art Troupe, then spoke. He said, "I am very pleased that our country, with the help of the Soviet Union, has suppressed the counter-revolutionaries. I fully believe that if we were not in China but in Hungary, all of us would have taken up arms and fought the counter-revolutionaries." He said, "The past twelve days have been very painful for us. During that painful time, the Chinese people gave us brotherly care and meticulous attention. This is truly brotherly friendship." He proposed a toast to the fraternal friendship of the socialist camp!

After the banquet, Governor Tao Zhu also met with the leaders of the Hungarian Art Troupe and had a cordial and friendly conversation with them.

    新华社广州7日电　匈牙利人民军文工团结束了在广州的演出，今晨乘专车离开广州去武汉。
    匈牙利人民军文工团在10月29日来到广州后，为广州市民和中国人民解放军驻广州的陆、海、空军部队作了十一场精采的表演，观众达三万三千多人。他们的演出受到了观众的热烈欢迎和感谢。
    在匈牙利人民军文工团离开广州前夕，广东省省长陶铸曾设宴欢送他们。陶铸省长在宴会上的讲话中，对匈牙利人民军文工团这次到广州演出表示感谢，对匈牙利人民最近遭受到的不幸事件表示深切的同情。他举杯祝贺匈牙利劳动人民和一切爱国者在对反革命进行的斗争中所取得的伟大胜利。在陶铸省长讲话的时候，匈牙利文工团全体团员不断地报以热烈的掌声。
    文工团团长梅莱克·拉斯洛少校接着讲话。他说：“我感到非常高兴的是，我国已经在苏联的帮助下把反革命分子镇压下去了。我完全相信，如果我们不在中国而在匈牙利，我们全体人员都会拿起武器和反革命分子战斗的。”他说：“过去的十二天对我们来说是非常痛苦的，在那痛苦的时间里，中国人民给了我们兄弟般的关怀和无微不至的照顾，这完全是兄弟般的友谊。”他建议为社会主义阵营的兄弟友谊干杯！
