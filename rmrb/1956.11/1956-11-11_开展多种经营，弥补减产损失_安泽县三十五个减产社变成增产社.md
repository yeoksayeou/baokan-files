Develop Diversified Economy to Make up for Production Losses
Anze County's Thirty-Five Production-Reduced Cooperatives Become Production-Increased Cooperatives

    (Our dispatch) Anze County, Shanxi Province, is a mountainous area that suffered from rare wind, hail, and flood disasters this year. During the autumn trial calculation and distribution work throughout the county, it was found that sixty-seven agricultural cooperatives were going to produce less than last year. The Anze County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party carefully analyzed the reasons for the production reduction in these cooperatives and believed that, in addition to the agricultural production reduction due to natural disasters as a major reason, neglecting and squeezing out sideline production in agricultural cooperatives was also an important reason. Therefore, the county committee specifically convened a meeting of cooperative cadres from the disaster-stricken agricultural cooperatives, and decided to vigorously mobilize members to find ways to increase production through various channels. The county supply and marketing cooperative, purchasing bureau, and other departments also actively provided support in terms of raw materials and sales channels.
    These production-reduced cooperatives, with the strong support of various departments in the county, actively developed diversified operations. Thirty-five agricultural cooperatives, including Gaobi, Anji, and Beiping, have successively opened up twenty-one avenues such as transportation, digging medicinal materials, burning lime, and raising pigs. In just two months, they earned more than 140,000 yuan, exceeding the original plan by 13%. The development of pig raising was the fastest. Anji Cooperative originally raised only 74 pigs, but by the end of September, it had increased to 174; Xihongyu Cooperative originally had less than 200 pigs, but by the beginning of October, it had developed to 314, an average of two pigs per household. They also organized members to go to the mountains to find medicinal materials. These thirty-five cooperatives dug more than 40,000 jin of forsythia alone. In order to encourage the enthusiasm of members to engage in individual sideline businesses, each agricultural cooperative reserved a certain amount of time for members to engage in household sideline businesses. In addition, Shibi and several other agricultural cooperatives dispatched a total of more than 300 people to build houses and work outside, and the income was entirely owned by the members themselves. In order to take care of them, the cooperatives also distributed sufficient rations to them.
    In this way, thirty-five production-reduced cooperatives became production-increased cooperatives, and the proportion of members' increased income also greatly increased.
    Now, these cooperatives have also proposed to carefully harvest and thresh during the autumn harvest to ensure that every grain is returned home in order to increase income. (Wen Wei)

    开展多种经营，弥补减产损失
    安泽县三十五个减产社变成增产社
    本报讯　山西安泽县是个山区，今年遭受了罕有的风、雹、洪等灾害。全县在秋季试算试分工作中，发现有六十七个农业社要比去年减产。中共安泽县委认真分析了这些社的减产原因，认为除了因受自然灾害农业减产是个主要原因外，农业社中忽视和挤掉副业生产也是一个重要原因。因此，县委专门召开了受灾农业社社干部会议，决定大力发动社员多方寻找增产门路。县供销社、采购局等部门又积极从原料、销路等方面给予支持。
    这些减产社，在县里各个部门的大力支持下，积极的开展了多种经营。高壁、安吉、北平等三十五个农业社，先后开辟了运输、刨药材、烧石灰、养猪等二十一种门路，在两个来月里，就收入十四万多元，超过了原订计划13％。养猪的发展最快，安吉社原来只养七十四头猪，到9月底已增到一百七十四头；西洪峪社原来不到二百头猪，到10月初已发展到三百十四头，平均每户养两头，并组织社员上山寻找药材，这三十五个社仅连翘一项就挖了四万余斤。为了鼓励社员个人经营副业的积极性，各个农业社都给社员留出一定时间搞家庭副业；此外，石壁等几个农业社，一共抽出了三百余人出外筑房做工，所得收入完全归社员个人所有，社里为了照顾他们，还分给他们足够的口粮。
    这样便使三十五个减产社成了增产社，社员增加收入的比例也大大增加。
    现在，这些社又提出要在秋收中细收细打、保证颗粒还家以增加收入。　（文蔚）
