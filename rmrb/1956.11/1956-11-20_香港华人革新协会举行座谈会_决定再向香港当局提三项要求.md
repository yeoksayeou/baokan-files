Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, November 18th: News from Hong Kong: The Executive Committee of the Hong Kong Chinese Reform Association held a symposium on the Kowloon riot incident at the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce auditorium on the 17th to discuss how to ensure peace and stability in the Hong Kong social environment.  Approximately 100 people attended, including all executive members of the Chinese Reform Association and representatives from more than 50 community organizations in Hong Kong and Kowloon (including units victimized in the riots).

After a heated discussion, the meeting unanimously passed a resolution deciding that the Chinese Reform Association would send a delegation to meet with Hong Kong Colonial Secretary, David, to urge the Hong Kong authorities to provide satisfactory responses to the previous demands made by the Chinese Reform Association regarding the riot incident.  At the same time, it was decided to make the following three additional demands to the Hong Kong British authorities: First, to request an understanding of the current stage of the Hong Kong authorities' investigation into the Kowloon riot incident; second, to support the demands for compensation and condolences made by the victims to the Hong Kong authorities; and third, to demand that the Hong Kong authorities guarantee the maintenance of peace and stability in Hong Kong and Kowloon in the future.

Chen Pishi, Chairman of the Hong Kong Chinese Reform Association and a barrister, pointed out at the beginning of the symposium that it is our very important responsibility to do everything possible and by all means to prevent a recurrence of similar Kowloon riot incidents in Hong Kong and Kowloon. The occurrence of this riot incident shows that Hong Kong may change from a place of peace and stability to a place of conflict in the world, which is completely disagreed upon by law-abiding residents of Hong Kong. Chen Pishi said that if Americans, Kuomintang agents, and illegal elements want to do this, then we believe it is necessary to take legal means to ensure that their attempts are defeated.

Chen Pishi also made a concluding speech at the end of the symposium. He said that everyone's speeches clearly pointed out that the Kowloon riot was not accidental or spontaneous, but organized, and the so-called dispute between the two factions of Chinese is completely wrong. In fact, this was an attack by rioters, including Kuomintang agents, on law-abiding residents.

Representatives from various victimized units in the cultural and educational circles, industrial and commercial circles, and trade unions in Hong Kong and Kowloon also spoke at the symposium. In their speeches, they all angrily denounced the atrocities of Kuomintang special agents and unanimously demanded that the Hong Kong authorities resolutely punish the rioters, provide condolences and compensation to the victims, and be truly responsible for protecting the safety of the lives and property of Hong Kong and Kowloon residents in the future.

    香港华人革新协会举行座谈会
    决定再向香港当局提三项要求
    一、要求了解对九龙事件的调查情况；二、对受害者进行抚恤和赔偿；三、保证港九地区今后的和平和安定。
    新华社广州18日电　香港消息：香港华人革新协会执行委员会17日在中华总商会礼堂举行九龙暴乱事件座谈会，讨论如何保证香港社会环境的和平和安定的问题。到会的有华人革新协会全体执行委员、港九五十多个社团单位（包括在暴乱中受害单位）的代表共约一百人。
    会议在经过热烈讨论以后一致通过决议，决定由华人革新协会派遣代表团往见香港辅政司戴维德，促请香港当局对华人革新协会前次就暴乱事件提出的要求作出满意答复，同时决定向香港英国当局再提出下列三项要求：一，要求了解香港当局对九龙暴乱事件所进行的调查工作目前已到达那一阶段；二，支持受害者对香港当局提出的赔偿和抚恤要求；三，要求香港当局保证维持今后港九的和平和安定。
    香港华人革新协会主席、大律师陈丕士在座谈会开始时指出，尽所有力量和一切方法来防止类似九龙暴乱事件在港九的重演是我们很重要的责任。这次暴乱事件的发生，表明香港有可能由和平安定而变成世界上一个纠纷之地，而这是香港守法居民所完全不同意的。陈丕士说，如果美国人、国民党特务和非法分子想这样做，那么我们认为有必要采取合法手段使他们的企图遭到失败。
    陈丕士还在座谈会结束时作了总结性发言。他说，大家的发言很清楚地指出，九龙暴乱并不是偶然和自发的，而是有组织的，所谓两派华人的纠纷的说法，是完全错误的。事实上这是包括国民党特务在内的暴徒向着守法居民的袭击。
    在座谈会上发言的还有港九文化教育界、工商界和工会的各受害单位的代表等。他们在发言中都愤怒地指斥国民党特务分子的暴行，并且一致要求香港当局切实惩办暴乱分子，给予受害者以抚恤和赔偿，以及今后应切实负责保护港九居民生命财产的安全。
