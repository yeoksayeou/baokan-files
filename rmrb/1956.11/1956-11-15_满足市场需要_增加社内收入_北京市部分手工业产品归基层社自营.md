Xinhua News Agency, November 13th dispatch: Xinhua News Agency reporter Ren Jiaji reports: Beijing's handicraft professional joint cooperatives have transferred the sales business of some products, which they previously managed, to basic-level handicraft production cooperatives for independent operation. This promotes direct contact between production and sales, enabling handicraft cooperatives to produce products that better meet market needs, and also increases the income of basic-level cooperatives. It is estimated that by the end of this year, more than one hundred basic-level cooperatives will earn more than 200,000 yuan in additional profits as a result.

In the past, 22% of the total value of Beijing's handicraft products was sold through various professional joint cooperatives. This method played a significant role in helping basic-level cooperatives open up sales channels and promote handicraft cooperation. However, when handicrafts were fully collectivized and the difficulty of selling handicraft products was greatly reduced, this intermediate link in sales hindered further improvement of the income of basic-level cooperatives and hindered the integration of production and sales. Therefore, starting in the second half of this year, the professional joint cooperatives have been transferring the sales business of some products directly to the basic-level handicraft cooperatives in a planned manner. Currently, nine professional joint cooperatives, including metal, shoes and hats, and leather goods, have transferred products worth a total of 3.94 million yuan to basic-level handicraft cooperatives for independent sales, accounting for 42% of the total sales of products managed by these professional joint cooperatives during the same period. When the products of the Second Leather Goods Production Cooperative were sold by the professional joint cooperative, it only produced five or six major categories of products such as leather suitcases and leather bags. Now, after establishing direct business relationships with various commercial departments, it has added fifteen new products such as tool sets according to market needs, and the average wage of cooperative members has also increased by 13.7%. The freight savings resulting from the reduction of operating links by only nine basic-level cooperatives amount to more than 360 yuan per month.

However, some problems have also arisen in this transfer of sales business to basic-level cooperatives. For example, there is currently a phenomenon of commercial departments seizing goods indiscriminately for some products that are in short supply. Some products that are mainly sold in other areas and require large-scale processing and ordering by commercial departments, and whose production is dispersed, have created difficulties for commercial departments in purchasing goods after being managed by basic-level cooperatives. After a small number of basic-level cooperatives sold their products themselves, they pursued profits and focused on producing popular products, resulting in a decline in product quality and a reduction in variety.

### 满足市场需要　增加社内收入  北京市部分手工业产品归基层社自营

    满足市场需要　增加社内收入
    北京市部分手工业产品归基层社自营
    据新华社13日讯　新华社记者任家骥报道：北京市手工业的专业联社把过去经营的部分产品的推销业务，交给基层手工业生产合作社自营，促进了产销直接见面，使手工业合作社生产的产品更能满足市场需要，基层社的收入也有了增加。预计到今年年底，一百多个基层社将因而多收入二十多万元的利润。
    过去北京市手工业产品总值的22％都是由各专业联社经手推销的，这种方法对于帮助基层社打开销路和促进手工业合作化方面起了很大作用。但是当手工业全部实现合作化，手工业品的推销困难已大大减少时，这种推销上的中间环节，就妨碍了进一步提高基层社的收入和妨碍产销的结合。因此从今年下半年开始，各专业联社就有步骤地把一部分产品的推销业务直接交给基层手工业合作社。目前金属、鞋帽、皮件等九个专业联社已交给基层手工业合作社自行推销的产品共值三百九十四万元，占这些专业联社同期经营的产品推销总额的42％。第二皮件生产合作社原来产品由专业联社推销时，只生产皮箱、皮包等五、六种大类产品，现在和各商业部门直接发生业务关系后，根据市场需要，增加了工具套等十五种新产品，社员平均工资也增加了13.7％。仅九个基层社由于减少经营环节而节约的运费，每月就有三百六十多元。
    但是在这次把推销业务交给基层社经营中，也发生了一些问题。如当前一些供不应求的产品，出现了商业部门乱抓货源的现象。一些主要销于外埠和商业部门需要大宗加工订货而生产分散的产品，在由基层社经营后，发生了商业部门进货不便的困难。有少数基层社自己推销产品后，由于追求利润和偏重生产畅销的产品，使产品质量下降和品种减少。
