    Three Major Soviet Libraries Loan Books to Chinese Universities and Scientific Research Departments
    Xinhua News Agency, 7th. Our country's scholars and scientific researchers have borrowed many books from Soviet libraries that are currently unavailable domestically.
    This international interlibrary loan started in August this year. University teachers and scientific researchers in Beijing, Tianjin, Harbin, Nanjing, and other places have borrowed many valuable scientific and technological works from the Soviet State Lenin Library, the Soviet Saltykov-Shchedrin State Public Library, and the All-Union State Library of Foreign Literature through the Beijing Library. A Nankai University teacher borrowed a history of chemical development from the Soviet Union, which is a reference book they urgently needed for preparing lessons and is not currently available in China.
    In the past few months, Soviet scholars have also borrowed historical books from the Ming and Qing dynasties and the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, as well as works by modern writers, from the Beijing Library through the Soviet State Lenin Library and other institutions.
    This international interlibrary loan method has been greatly welcomed by our country's scholars.

    苏联三个大图书馆借书给我国大学和科学研究部门
    新华社7日讯　我国学者和科学研究人员从苏联的图书馆借到了目前国内没有的许多书籍。
    这种国际图书互借是从今年8月开始的。北京、天津、哈尔滨、南京等地的大学教师和科学研究人员们，通过北京图书馆，已经从苏联国家列宁图书馆、苏联萨尔蒂科夫—谢德林国家公共图书馆和全苏外国文图书馆借到了许多珍贵的科学技术著作。南开大学教师从苏联借到一部化学发展史，这是他们备课急需而国内目前还没有的一部参考书。
    几个月来，苏联学者们也通过苏联国家列宁图书馆等向北京图书馆借去了明、清两代和太平天国的历史书籍和现代作家们的作品等。
    这种国际间图书互借的办法，受到了我国学者很大的欢迎。
