With reverence, everyone solemnly commemorates the 90th anniversary of the birth of Mr. Sun Yat-sen, the great pioneer of the Chinese revolution. Many seniors and comrades have elaborated on Mr. Sun Yat-sen's great achievements in various aspects based on their own understanding and experience. However, the important issue of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's opposition to Fascist ideas has not received the attention it deserves. I am now recommending a letter from Mr. Sun Yat-sen to the Merchant Corps that has not yet been collected in various versions of the Complete Works of Sun Yat-sen, and I will also discuss my understanding of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's great revolutionary thoughts around this letter. I will transcribe the original letter as follows:

    To the Gentlemen of the Merchant Corps,
    The government can now acknowledge that part of the military supplies privately transported by Chen Lianbo were purchased with funds raised by you. The provincial governor will be instructed to hand them over to you in accordance with the regulations on civil defense forces. Therefore, the issue of your guns can be resolved! In addition, there are two more matters that you must assist the government in resolving. Recently, it has been discovered by the Merchant Corps itself and other sources that Chen Lianbo has a major conspiracy to use the power of the Merchant Corps to overthrow the government and follow in the footsteps of the Italian Mussolini. This matter was rumored in Western newspapers in Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Tianjin a month or two ago, and was reported in detail. Yesterday, Chen Lianbo asked a Hong Kong Western newspaper to publish an article attacking the government and praising the Merchant Corps, even calling the Guangzhou Merchant Corps the "Conservative Party" (transliteration of Fascist), that is, the stubborn party of capitalists in Italy. Foreigners also said that Chen Lianbo was indeed plotting wrongdoing, and it was heard that some foreigners were planning to overthrow the government on August 14, replace it with Chen Lianbo as the Governor of Guangdong, cancel independence, and surrender to the North. Recently, Chen Lianbo sent representatives to Luoyang to collude with Wu Peifu in the name of the Merchant Corps. These facts are obvious, and people in China and abroad know it. This is confirmed by the tone of the couplets on the celebration archway, which is consistent with this matter and amounts to a confession. Such acts of conspiracy are being carried out openly and blatantly, showing that Chen Lianbo and others regard the government as nothing! The government is broad-minded and does not want to implicate innocent people, so apart from Chen Lianbo, there are two approaches: First, those who are aware of the situation and repent can report themselves, and the government will pardon their past deeds and will not investigate further! Second, if there are those who are stubborn and still want to plot wrongdoing, you are responsible for identifying them and handing them over to the government for punishment. I believe that most of you are people who understand righteousness and support the republic, and will not allow scoundrels to mix in the Merchant Corps, using the name to harm the government. This matter concerns the survival of the Republic of China and the success or failure of the revolution, and I, the Grand Marshal, must thoroughly investigate it. I hope that you will earnestly assist the government in eliminating internal spies, so that the Merchant Corps and the government can unite as one, defend our homeland, and eliminate the cruel and violent. If you can do this, then I, the Grand Marshal, will rely on the Merchant Corps as my arms and legs and regard you as my confidants. This is not only the good fortune of the Merchant Corps, but also the blessing of Guangdong. The government has great expectations. Now I am sending Secretary Lin Zhimian, Lian Shenghai, and Adjutant Deng Yanhua as government representatives to contact you and resolve the above two issues, and to serve as resident members of the Merchant Corps headquarters to assist you in rectifying the internal affairs of the Merchant Corps. If you can eliminate the suspicion of opposing the government, then there will be no need to station troops in the cities of Guangzhou and Foshan to prevent unforeseen events. The merchants and people can live and work in peace and share prosperity. This is truly a great benefit to the people, and I hope the gentlemen of the Merchant Corps will consider it carefully. Sun Wen, August 19.
    (See Volume 2 of the "Confiscation of Arms Tide," pages 42-43).

To clarify the issue, I would like to first discuss the historical context at that time. Since Mr. Sun Yat-sen accepted the advice and assistance of the Soviet Union and the Chinese Communist Party to reorganize the Kuomintang and began to implement a thorough anti-imperialist and anti-feudal program, the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal revolutionary movement has since flourished. Guangzhou became the center of the revolutionary movement at that time. Imperialism and the landlords and comprador class, unwilling to die, painstakingly tried to extinguish this prairie fire. In particular, British imperialism, which was based in Hong Kong and considered Guangdong its sphere of influence, tried its best to undermine the revolutionary government of Guangzhou. It encouraged Chen Lianbo, the compradore of the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation: "If you can mobilize the Merchant Corps to oppose the government, we British will help you organize a merchant government, and you, Chen Lianbo, will be the Washington of China." (See Mr. Sun Yat-sen's Complete Works, article "The Cause of Internal Disorder in China"). After receiving the support of British imperialism, Chen Lianbo boldly imitated Mussolini's methods, organized a Fascist death squad to control the Merchant Corps, organized a counter-revolutionary armed force, and actively carried out his counter-revolutionary conspiracy.

The Guangdong Merchant Corps was founded in 1912. It was originally a bourgeois self-defense organization mainly for maintaining order in the business community. In 1922, Mr. Sun Yat-sen invited troops from Yunnan and Guangxi to Guangdong to quell the rebellion of Chen Jiongming, driving Chen Jiongming out of Guangzhou. However, Chen's remaining forces still occupied the Dongjiang area and had not been eliminated. They continued to act arbitrarily in the areas they occupied. In the north and west of Guangdong, warlords were watching for opportunities to take advantage of the chaos. In order to meet military needs, "all means were exhausted, but they were still insufficient. As a result, various miscellaneous taxes that harmed the people arose frequently... Corrupt officials took advantage of the name of raising military funds to seek profits." (See "Northern Expedition Declaration"). Due to the above situation, some Guangdong bourgeoisie became dissatisfied with the revolutionary government. On the other hand, due to the development of the labor and peasant movements after the reorganization of the Kuomintang, and the rumors spread by imperialism and domestic reactionaries, some bourgeoisie became apprehensive. Chen Lianbo took advantage of this situation to strengthen his counter-revolutionary activities under the guise of strengthening the armed self-defense of the business community. His first step was to invite representatives of merchant corps from all over the province to Guangzhou to hold a provincial merchant corps conference, organize a provincial merchant corps joint defense headquarters, and unify control of the scattered merchant corps armed forces throughout the province. Further, he attempted to organize a provincial joint association of merchant and rural communities (that is, a large alliance of landlord and comprador armed forces). Once this step was achieved, he would implement his conspiracy to "sweep away all the evil spirits and poisonous fog (that is, the revolutionary government and the people) from the entire Guangdong." (See Volume 4 of the "Confiscation of Arms Tide," page 18).

On May 27, 1924, Chen Lianbo convened a provincial merchant corps conference. He obtained the position of commander-in-chief of the joint defense, and used this to actively encourage towns and cities in Guangdong that had not established merchant corps to establish them, and places that already had merchant corps to actively expand their organizations and add weapons to strengthen their forces. He once obtained a license from the military and political department of the Guangdong government at that time in the name of purchasing self-defense firearms for fellow members, and used this opportunity to privately transport a large number of military supplies and organize a counter-revolutionary army. On August 8, when a batch of military supplies privately transported by Chen Lianbo arrived in Guangzhou on a Danish ship, it was discovered during inspection that the military supplies on this ship were said to belong to the Merchant Corps, but the passport that the Merchant Corps had obtained from the government was not to take effect until forty days later, but now it had suddenly arrived in five days. The passport stated that they wanted to buy British-made .82 caliber scrap guns, but this batch of military supplies was German-made .763 caliber, and the style was different from what was declared for purchase. At the same time, the number also did not match what was stated on the passport. Naturally, this batch of guns was either a cover-up or smuggled, so Mr. Sun Yat-sen decided to detain it and investigate its origin. Chen Lianbo, under the instructions of British imperialism in Shamian, falsely claimed that these were "self-defense" guns purchased with funds from the Merchant Corps members themselves, and that the government's detention of the military supplies was intentionally seizing the guns purchased with funds from the merchants, and intentionally depriving the merchants of their right to self-defense. He used this to incite Merchant Corps members to threaten the revolutionary government with a strike to return the confiscated military supplies. On August 14, more than 1,000 Merchant Corps members, driven by Chen Lianbo, went to the Grand Marshal's Mansion in Henan, Guangzhou to petition Mr. Sun Yat-sen. Mr. Sun Yat-sen personally received the representatives of the Merchant Corps and gave a speech to the Merchant Corps masses, explaining the reasons for the confiscation of the military supplies. At the same time, he exposed Chen Lianbo's conspiracy in front of the Merchant Corps masses, reminding the general Merchant Corps members not to be blindly used by Chen Lianbo as sacrifices to oppose the government. Then he also stated that he "very much wanted to contact you (referring to the general bourgeois elements who had no political ambitions) Merchant Corps, and very much wanted you to be my arms and legs." At that time, he also promised to tell them the handling method after clarifying the origin of the guns. (See Mr. Sun Yat-sen's Complete Works, article "What the Government Detained Was Not Firearms But the Danish Ship Transporting Military Supplies"). After Mr. Sun Yat-sen's explanation, the Merchant Corps masses dispersed. Later, after the facts of Chen Lianbo's treachery were thoroughly investigated, the facts were told to the Merchant Corps. "In terms of procedures, I (Mr. Sun Yat-sen referring to himself) have not used official documents, only private letters." The above letter, which has not been collected in various versions of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's Complete Works, is the private letter that Mr. Sun Yat-sen mentioned in his speech "The Cause of Internal Disorder in China" to the Merchant Corps.

The most prominent and noteworthy aspect of this letter is that Mr. Sun Yat-sen exposed Chen Lianbo's counter-revolutionary essence as being the same as that of the Italian Mussolini Fascists (Mr. Sun Yat-sen wrote "Mussolini" as "墨素连呢" and "Fascist" as "化思时地" in this letter). Mr. Sun Yat-sen then pointed out that the Fascists are "the stubborn party of capitalists in Italy." He ordered Liao Zhongkai, the then Governor of Guangdong, to "immediately issue an order to investigate Chen Lianbo and bring him to justice for punishment" (see the Governor's Office's order to arrest Chen Lianbo). For his henchmen, "if there are those who are stubborn and still want to plot wrongdoing, you are responsible for identifying them and handing them over to the government for punishment." (See above letter). At that time, Mussolini had just come to power, and the essence of Fascism was not yet fully understood by the general public. Mr. Sun Yat-sen at that time thoroughly recognized his face and regarded the activities of the Fascists as a major counter-revolutionary conspiracy. Mr. Sun Yat-sen had such a keen ability to identify this dying and struggling fierce and stubborn force of imperialism. Today, when we read his letters from that year, we still feel the freshness of these words, and at the same time, we deeply feel the greatness of Mr. Sun Yat-sen, which deserves our sincere respect.

In order to implement his revolutionary doctrine (that is, the doctrine of alliance with Russia, alliance with the Communist Party, and assistance to the peasants and workers' movement), Mr. Sun Yat-sen was irreconcilable with this group of Fascist-style Merchant Corps whose purpose was to suppress and slaughter workers (see the telegram from the Executive Committee of the Guangzhou Workers' Representatives' Conference at that time), resolutely eliminate the Communist Party, slander the Soviet Union (see various documents of the Merchant Corps at that time), and overthrow the revolutionary government. When the Merchant Corps openly opened fire on the workers' groups, peasants' groups, and students who were parading on National Day, Mr. Sun Yat-sen received a report in Shaoguan and immediately called on the officers and soldiers to "make a vow of decisive death, and must completely eliminate the treacherous soldiers and treacherous merchants in the province to maintain the revolutionary base... immediately rise up and kill the bandits, and never look back" (see "Mr. Sun Yat-sen's Complete Works"). During the democratic revolutionary period of the 1920s, Mr. Sun Yat-sen, regardless of the obstruction of the right-wing Kuomintang members, was able to adopt such a resolute and ruthless attitude of annihilation towards the Fascist elements. Today, when we review his posthumous works, we still receive great spiritual encouragement.

Writing this, one cannot help but think that after Mr. Sun Yat-sen's death, the Chiang Kai-shek group openly revered Mussolini and Hitler as their teachers, organized Fascist henchmen, inherited the mantle of Chen Lianbo, who was an enemy of Mr. Sun Yat-sen in those years, and engaged in anti-Soviet, anti-communist slaughter of workers and peasants, doing things that Chen Lianbo could not even dream of: colluding with imperialism and opposing the revolutionary people. However, in order to cover up their ugly faces, they still held up Mr. Sun Yat-sen's signboard to give themselves a fig leaf. If these people do not want to forever isolate themselves from humanity, then, on the occasion of the nationwide solemn commemoration of the 90th anniversary of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's birth, they should repent and completely correct their past mistakes.

From the above letter from Mr. Sun Yat-sen to the Merchant Corps, we can also see Mr. Sun Yat-sen's clear distinction between the enemy and ourselves when handling the Merchant Corps incident. Mr. Sun Yat-sen resolutely adopted a dictatorship towards the Fascist conspiracy of the comprador class; but for the general Merchant Corps who had no intention of counter-revolution, he believed that "most of them are people who understand righteousness and support the republic," so he hoped that they would "earnestly assist the government in eliminating internal spies, so that the Merchant Corps and the government can unite as one, defend our homeland, and eliminate the cruel and violent." If they can fight together with all the people against the conspiracy of imperialism and the comprador class, he will regard the "Merchant Corps as arms and legs." At the same time, he believed that the situation of popular dissatisfaction caused by "various miscellaneous taxes," "arrogant soldiers and generals," "violence against the people," and "corrupt officials taking advantage of the name of raising military funds to seek profits" was due to the imperfection of the revolutionary method and was not related to the revolutionary doctrine. If the method was not good, it could be corrected according to the specific conditions without changing the principles of the revolutionary doctrine. He also pointed out: "The great disease is that the people adhere to the habit of not asking about state affairs and do not cooperate with the revolutionary government." Therefore, he hoped that the general merchants and people would "support the revolutionary government, implement the revolutionary doctrine, and at the same time, negotiate with the revolutionary government to improve the methods of carrying out the revolution." (The above is from the "Northern Expedition Declaration"). Here, we can also see how Mr. Sun Yat-sen tried his best to promote the spirit of democratic consultation within the people, and through consultation, to better implement the revolutionary policy. Mr. Sun Yat-sen warned: "If the current situation is not good and slanders the doctrine itself, and opposes the existence of the revolutionary government, then the revolutionary government, in order to uphold its doctrine, must plan to suppress these opposing attempts and eliminate them." At that time, a part of the bourgeoisie in Guangdong confused the revolutionary doctrine with the shortcomings existing in the work, so they ran with the imperialist comprador class and made themselves a counter-revolutionary tool of the imperialists and their running dogs.

At that time, in order to maintain the revolutionary doctrine of alliance with Russia, alliance with the Communist Party, and assistance to the peasants and workers, which was a thorough anti-imperialist and anti-feudal revolution, and to maintain the existence of the revolutionary regime, Mr. Sun Yat-sen adopted an enlightened and resolute policy of suppressing the counter-revolutionary Merchant Corps organization and its counter-revolutionary leaders, which was completely correct. This is a concrete and great manifestation of his firm revolutionary spirit. Although some people at that time only saw the fact of suppressing the Merchant Corps, causing a certain degree of disorder and destruction in the Guangzhou economic market, they did not clearly distinguish the relationship between Chen Lianbo's counter-revolutionary conspiracy, the warlords' taking advantage of the fire, and the lofty purpose of protecting the revolutionary doctrine and the revolutionary regime. Therefore, they made incorrect accusations and criticisms of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's suppression of the Merchant Corps, and unconsciously made favorable propaganda for the reactionaries.

Therefore, in commemorating the 90th anniversary of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's birth, learning from Mr. Sun Yat-sen's experience in resolutely handling the Merchant Corps incident at that time has great practical significance.

    从处理商团事件看孙中山先生的反法西斯思想
    郭煜中
    大家都怀着崇敬的心情来隆重地纪念我国伟大的革命先驱者孙中山先生诞辰九十周年，许多前辈与同志都对孙中山先生各方面的伟大功绩，根据自己认识与体会加以叙述与发挥，但是对孙中山先生反对法西斯蒂思想这一个重要问题，还没有给予应有的重视，我现在把我自己看到一封还没有被各种版本的中山全书所收集的孙中山先生给商团的函件推荐出来，同时环绕着这封函件我也谈谈自己对孙中山先生伟大革命思想的认识。我现在把原函抄录如下：
  商团诸君公鉴！
    陈廉伯所私运之军火，其一部分为诸君集资而购者，政府已可承认，行当令省长按照民团条例，交给诸君，故对于诸君之枪枝问题，已可作为解决矣！此外尚有二事，必须诸君协助政府以解决之。近日由商团本体及各方面发现出陈廉伯有极大阴谋，欲借商团之力，以倾复政府，而步意国墨素连呢之后尘，此事前壹两月，香港上海天津各西报，已有访闻，登诸报章，言之凿凿。昨日陈廉伯托香港某西报登一论说攻击政府。颂扬商团者，犹声声称广州商团为（化思时地）党，即意大利之资本家顽锢党也。而外国人亦言陈廉伯确有谋为不轨之事，闻其中策画者有外国人，定期8月14日推翻政府取而代之、以陈廉伯为广东督军，取销独立，投降北方。近日陈廉伯派代表往洛阳勾结吴佩孚，乃用商团名义，此等事实彰彰，中外人民皆知，证以此次庆祝牌楼各对联之口气，亦与此事吻合，实已不打自招。此等谋为不轨之事，竟公然明目张胆而为之，陈廉伯等之视政府为无物，于斯可见矣！政府宽大为怀，不忍株连，故除廉伯一人外，分作两层办法：其一，其知情而悔悟者，能自行检举，政府当宥其既往，不事深究！其二，倘有执迷不悟，仍欲图谋不轨者，则责成诸君自行指出，送交政府惩办，吾信诸君中，大多数为深明大义，拥护共和之人，而不容有败类混迹商团中，假借名义，而危害政府也。此事关于民国存亡，革命成败，而本大元帅必当彻底查究者。望诸君切实协助政府，淘汰内奸，使商团与政府能联成一气，捍卫乡邦，剪除残暴。倘能如此，则本大元帅必倚商团为手足，视诸君为心腹，此不独商团之幸，亦广东之福也，政府实有厚望焉。兹派秘书林直勉，连声海，副官邓彦华三人为政府代表，来与诸君接洽，以解决以上两问题，为常驻商团总所委员，协助诸君整顿商团内部，果能从此销除反对政府之嫌疑，则省佛二地，市内不需驻扎军队，以防不测。而商民更可安居乐业，共享太平。此实人民莫大之利也，惟商团诸君图之。孙文，8月19日。
    （见扣械潮卷二，页四二——四三）。
    为了把问题交代清楚，我想先把当时的历史情况谈一谈。自从孙中山先生接受了苏联与中国共产党的建议与帮助改组了国民党，开始实行彻底的反帝反封建纲领之后，反帝反封建的革命运动从此蓬勃开展，广州形成为当时革命运动的中心，不甘心于自己死亡的帝国主义与地主、买办阶级处心积虑地想扑灭这个燎原的火焰。尤其是盘据香港以广东为自己势力范围的英帝国主义，更是挖空心思地企图破坏广州革命政府。它怂恿汇丰银行的买办陈廉伯：“如果你能够运动商团、反对政府，我们英国便帮助你组织商人政府，你陈廉伯就是中国的华盛顿”。（见中山全书“中国内乱之因”一文）陈廉伯自得到英帝国主义的支持之后，就大胆地去仿效墨索里尼的办法，组织法西斯死党去把持商团、筹组反革命武装，积极进行他的反革命阴谋。
    广东商团自1912年开创，它原来主要是一个维持商场秩序的资产阶级自卫组织。1922年孙中山先生为了荡平陈炯明叛变，请滇桂等地部队到广东平乱，把陈炯明赶出广州，但是陈的残余势力还盘踞东江没有消灭，在他占领的地区内仍然作威作福，广东北边、西边都有军阀乘乱窥视，为了应付军事的需要“罗掘多方，犹不能给，于是病民之诸捐杂税，繁然并起……贪官污吏，托名筹饷，因缘为利”（见“北伐宣言”）因以上情况，引起一部分广东资产阶级对革命政府的不满。另一方面由于国民党改组之后工农运动的发展，以及帝国主义与国内反动派的造谣，使一部分资产阶级产生疑惧。陈廉伯就利用这种形势在加强商界武装自卫的幌子之下，布置他的反革命活动，他第一步就是邀请全省各地的商团代表到广州开全省商团会议，组织全省商团联防总部，统一控制全省分散的商团武装，再进一步就企图组织全省商乡大联团（即地主买办武装大联合），做到这一步之后，即实行他的“举全粤之妖氛毒雾（即革命政府与人民）一扫而空”的阴谋。（见扣械潮卷四，一八页）
    1924年5月27日陈廉伯召集全省商团会议，他取得了联防总长的职位，借此积极鼓动广东没有办商团的城镇筹办商团，已有商团的地方，积极扩大组织，增添武装以壮大自己的力量。他曾以代替团友购买自卫枪枝的名义向当时广东政府军政部领取购械护照，借此机会私运大批军火，组织反革命军队。8月8日陈廉伯私运的一批军火由一只丹麦船运进广州时，经过检查发现这只船的军火据说是商团的，但是商团向政府领的护照是要四十天以后才生效，现在忽然五天就到了，他护照里注明要买的是英制八二口径废枪，而这批军火则是德制七六三口径式样与报买的不同，同时数目亦与护照上载明要买的不符。自然这批枪枝不是顶包就是偷运，因此孙中山先生决定将它扣留，把它的来历追查清楚。陈廉伯在沙面受英帝国主义指使，冒称这就是商团分子自己出资购买的“自卫”枪枝，政府扣留军械是有意谋夺商人出资购买的枪枝，有意剥夺商人自卫的权利，用此煽动商团分子以罢市来威胁革命政府发还被扣留的军火。8月14日商团分子一千多人在陈廉伯驱使下到广州河南大本营向孙中山先生请愿。孙中山先生亲自接见商团代表，并对商团群众发表演说，说明扣械原因。同时他在商团群众面前揭露陈廉伯的阴谋，提醒一般商团分子不要盲目受陈廉伯利用来作为反对政府的牺牲品。接着他还表明自己“很想和你们（指没有政治野心的一般资产阶级分子）商团联络的，很想要你们做手足的”，当时他还答应把枪枝的来历查清楚之后告诉他们处理办法。（见中山全书“政府所扣的不是枪械是私运军火的丹麦船”一文。），商团群众经过中山先生的说明之后就散了，以后把陈廉伯的叛迹查得水落石出之后就把事实告诉商团，“在手续上，我（中山先生自称）还没有用公文，只用私缄”。上面这封没有收集到各种中山全书中去的函件，就是孙中山先生作“中国内乱之因”的演讲中所提到的给商团的私缄。
    这封函件最突出地引人注意的地方就在于孙中山先生揭穿了陈廉伯的反革命实质，是同意大利墨索里尼法西斯蒂（孙中山先生在这封函件中写的是“墨素连呢”“化思时地”）一样的。孙中山先生接着指出法西斯蒂“即意大利之资本家顽锢党也”，他命令当时广东省长廖仲恺“立将陈廉伯通令查缉归案惩办”（见省长公署通缉陈廉伯的命令），对于他的党羽“倘有执迷不悟，仍欲图谋不轨者，则责成诸君自行指出，送交政府惩办”。（见上函）当时墨索里尼刚刚登台不久，法西斯主义的本质还不是被一般人所完全了解的，孙中山先生当时就很透彻地识穿了他的面目，把法西斯蒂的活动作为反革命的重大阴谋来看待，孙中山先生对帝国主义这股垂死争扎的凶恶顽固势力有如此锐敏的识别能力，我们今天阅读到他当年的函件时，还感觉到这些词句的新鲜，同时也使我们深深地感觉到先生的伟大，值得我们衷心地敬仰。
    孙中山先生为了贯彻他的革命主义（即联俄、联共、扶助农工运动的主义），对这一伙以压迫与残杀工人（见当时广州工人代表会执行委员会通电）、坚决以锄除共产党、毁谤苏联（见当时商团的各种文告）、推翻革命政府为目的的法西斯式的商团誓不两立。当商团公然开枪射击国庆游行的工团、农团、学生的时候，孙中山先生在韶关得到报告，立刻号召官兵“立决死之誓，必尽灭省中之奸兵奸商以维持革命之地盘……立即起义杀贼，绝无反顾”（见“中山全书”）。在二十年代民主主义革命时期，孙中山先生对法西斯分子不顾右派国民党人的阻挠，居然能采取这样坚决无情的歼灭态度，今天我们温习他的遗作的时候，精神上还得到了莫大的鼓舞。
    写到这里，使人不禁想起了孙中山先生逝世之后，蒋介石集团公然地尊崇墨索里尼、希特勒为自己的师傅，组织法西斯党羽，继承了当年与孙中山先生为敌的陈廉伯的反苏反共屠杀工农群众的衣钵，干着当年陈廉伯所望尘莫及的勾结帝国主义反对革命人民的勾当。但是他们为了掩盖自己的丑恶面目，还拿着孙中山先生的牌子给自己做遮羞布。这些人如果不是想永远地自绝于人类，那末，际此全国一致隆重地纪念孙中山先生九十周年诞辰的时候，就应该翻然悔悟，痛改前非了。
    从上面这封孙中山先生给商团的函件中，我们还看到中山先生处理商团事件时的清楚的敌我界线。孙中山先生对买办阶级的法西斯阴谋是坚决采取专政的；但是对于一般没有存心反革命的商团，他认为“大多数为深明大义，拥护共和之人”，所以希望他们“切实协助政府，淘汰内奸，使商团与政府能联成一气，捍卫乡邦，剪除残暴”。如果他们能与全体人民一起同帝国主义与买办阶级的阴谋作斗争，他便把“商团为手足”。同时他对那些因“诸捐杂税”“骄兵悍将”，“为暴于民”，“贪官污吏，托名筹饷，因缘为利”而引起人民不满的情况，则认为是革命的方法未善，同革命主义没有关联，方法不好在不改变革命主义的原则下，可以根据具体条件设法纠正。他还指出：“盖此大病，在人民守其不问国事之习，不与革命政府合作”，所以他希望一般商民“拥护革命政府，实行革命主义，同时与革命政府，协商改善革命之进行方法”。（以上均见“北伐宣言”）在这里边，我们也可以看出孙中山先生对人民内部是怎样的极力主张发扬民主协商的精神，通过协商的办法，使革命的政策更好的贯彻下去。孙中山先生警告说：“若以现状之未善，而谤及于主义之本身，以反对革命政府之存在，则革命政府为拥护其主义计，不得不谋压此等反对企图，而使之消灭”。当时广东有一部分资产阶级就是把革命主义与工作中存在着的缺点混同起来，因此，跟着帝国主义买办阶级跑，而使自己变成了帝国主义者及其走狗的反革命工具。
    孙中山先生当时为了维护革命的联俄、联共、扶助农工的彻底的反帝反封建的革命主义，为了维护革命政权的存在，采取了英明的坚决的对反革命的商团组织及其反革命头子镇压政策是完全正确的。这是他坚定不移的革命精神具体的伟大的表现。尽管当时有一部分人们，只是片面地看到了镇压商团的事实，造成了广州经济市场一定程度的紊乱与破坏，他们是没有把陈廉伯的反革命阴谋，各派军阀们的乘火打劫与保护革命主义革命政权这一个崇高的目的之间的关系分别清楚，因此对孙中山先生讨伐商团作出了不正确的责难与批评，因而不自觉地给反动派作了有利的宣传。
    因此，在纪念孙中山先生九十周年诞辰的时候，学习孙中山先生坚决处理当时商团事件的经验，是具有重大的现实意义的。
