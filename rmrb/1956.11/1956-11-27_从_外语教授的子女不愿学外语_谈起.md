    Starting from "Foreign Language Professors' Children are Unwilling to Learn Foreign Languages"
    Chen Changhao

    Not long ago, I had the opportunity to discuss with several foreign language professors from universities about how to cultivate foreign language cadres. One professor said with a stern expression: "Foreign language professors' children are unwilling to learn foreign languages." At first, it was a bit hard to believe. Although not all foreign language professors' children must study foreign languages, and not all foreign language professors' children do not study foreign languages, why are the children of professors who regard foreign languages as their lifelong career unwilling to study foreign languages? Why do professors who share the joys and sorrows of foreign languages not persuade their children to study foreign languages? Why does the social atmosphere in China, which is building socialism, not encourage some young people to study foreign languages? It's really hard to understand!

    Are foreign languages useless? No. Without learning foreign languages, how can we keep up with the advanced levels of the world? Without learning foreign languages, how can we march towards science? Without learning foreign languages, how can we translate all the foreign masterpieces and how can we translate Chinese works into foreign languages? Without learning foreign languages, how can we deal with more than one hundred countries in the world and how can we seek a common language with the two billion people there? It can be seen that foreign languages are indeed very useful.

    Is there too little to be translated? No. The vast majority of the world's great scientific and cultural works have not yet been translated into Chinese. At least two-thirds of the works of Marx and Engels have not yet been translated, half of Lenin's works have not yet met the Chinese people, and the vast majority of important philosophical and social science works before and contemporary with Marxism have not been translated into Chinese. Many valuable natural science works of modern and recent times also do not have Chinese translations. It can be seen that there are indeed many things to be translated into Chinese.

    Does our country have too many foreign language talents? Do we understand too many foreign languages? Neither. Our country certainly does not have enough talent for translating from foreign languages into Chinese, and there are even fewer talents for translating from Chinese into foreign languages. The working experience of translating the "Eighth National Congress" documents into foreign languages proves that without the help of foreign friends, Spanish could not be translated, Russian could not be translated well, and German, French, and Japanese could not be translated perfectly. Although English is relatively reliable, the translation still needs to be polished. The translation of Chinese into various foreign languages ​​almost entirely relies on old cadres from before liberation and those who have returned from abroad after liberation. Very few cadres trained domestically after liberation are competent. Thousands upon thousands of newly trained foreign language cadres, although they have a certain knowledge of foreign languages, cannot write decent foreign language and speak fluent foreign languages. Many people in our country have learned Russian after liberation, which is a good phenomenon, but many people have given up learning English, German, French, Japanese and other foreign languages, and very few people learn the languages ​​of Eastern European People's Democratic countries. Some people have started learning Spanish, but no one has learned Portuguese. Some people are learning Indonesian, but very few people are learning Arabic, Hindi, Urdu, and Burmese. According to statistics, there are twenty-three countries that use Spanish, with a population of 170 million, and seventeen countries that use Arabic, with a population of nearly 100 million. Hindi and Urdu are used by about 430 million people in India and Pakistan. In other words, we are still extremely unfamiliar with the various languages ​​used by one-third of the world's population. It can be seen that our foreign language talents are indeed lacking, and we understand too few foreign languages.

    Is translation work unrelated to scientific research? Can't doing translation work march towards science? Neither. The ultimate goal of learning foreign languages ​​is to conduct scientific, cultural exchanges and economic affairs contacts with people from all over the world, all of which must be achieved through translation. Translation is not a simple technical work, but a creative scientific work. As far as translation itself is concerned, before starting the translation, it is necessary to comprehensively explore the content, essence, and socio-historical background of the original work, and examine every concept and fact that one does not understand. As far as language is concerned, not only must one understand the structure and characteristics of the foreign language and the structure and characteristics of one's own national language, but also understand the rules and art of translating one language into another. As far as research work is concerned, one must study the ideological essence and expression form of the original text before translation, study the best expression method during translation, and study the translated things after translation, thereby enriching one's theoretical knowledge and professional knowledge. Through translation, a good foundation can be laid for professional research work, becoming an expert in the subject, a language expert, or a translation expert.

    Since foreign languages ​​are very useful in our country, there is a great shortage of foreign language talents, there are many foreign languages ​​to learn, and translation work as scientific research is very important, why are even the children of foreign language professors unwilling to study foreign languages? After many discussions and some investigations, I feel that there are indeed some reasons for this. What are the reasons? Let's see the following article.

    Society does not pay enough attention to translation work and foreign language learning. In the seven years since liberation, our country's newspapers and magazines have discussed all issues, and the importance of the work of apprentices, nannies, nurses, and teachers has also been discussed, but the importance of translation work and foreign language learning has not been truly raised even once, and there has not even been an editorial on this topic. At several National People's Congress meetings, the issue of birth control has also received due attention, but no one has ever talked about the issue of translation work and foreign language learning. This year, when calling on young people to apply for universities, almost all disciplines had people publicizing them in newspapers and periodicals, but no one from foreign language colleges and translation institutions introduced the importance of their respective fields to young people. Our country has at least one hundred types of literary publications alone, but the only "Translation Bulletin" stopped publication for some reason, and such publications have not been born again in the past five years. How unreasonable is this phenomenon!

    Many people underestimate translation work and foreign language learning. "'Translation is just copying a gourd according to the drawing'—this is a certain editor's view on translation." "This comrade's professional level is very high, but unfortunately he is a translator!"—someone said this to a Japanese translator. "Professor ××, the leadership is considering transferring you to serve as a German interpreter. Do you feel that you are losing your status?"—this Peking University professor who was transferred reflected in this way. "There are still people learning English now!"—a rather responsible comrade exclaimed to an English professor at Peking University. How discouraging these words are!

    Many agencies have unreasonable treatment systems for translation cadres. The translation cadres in the Translation Office of the Renmin University of China cannot enjoy the due treatment according to their administrative levels. The original translators were transferred to become teachers and had the right to eat in the teachers' cafeteria and sit in the front row when listening to reports, but the remaining translators did not have such rights. As for the ranks and salaries of translators, they are generally set relatively low, which is probably a more common phenomenon. A comrade who graduated from a foreign language college in Harbin and worked as a translator was not listed as an officer as a college graduate when registering for military service, but only registered as a soldier, allegedly because he "does not qualify as a technician." Such things are also quite thought-provoking.

    Many units do not use translation cadres properly, only using them without training them. A certain design institute "throws translators around like pawns, asking you to do mechanical processing today, heating and ventilation tomorrow, and water supply and drainage the day after...translating has become a 'chore' worker." This must be true. The phenomenon of wasting translation manpower in a certain design institute is extremely serious. It is said that 77% of the translation power in a department of the institute is wasted. Treating translators as "omnipotent," not training them at ordinary times, not letting them prepare in advance, and scolding them when errors occur in translation is not an isolated phenomenon. No wonder someone lamented: "The translators are always scolded at meetings, saying that the translators are not good, but who has ever asked themselves what training work has been done for the translators? It's really unspeakable." May I ask, can translation cadres be used in this way?

    The quality of new students in foreign language departments, teaching principles, etc. are not without problems. In order to accelerate socialist construction, it is necessary to emphasize the quality of new students in science and engineering departments, but attention should also be paid to the quality of new students in foreign language departments, and the principle of "teaching students according to their aptitude" should also be remembered. In the unfavorable situation of not having foreign language classes in middle schools, foreign language freshmen should have certain subjective conditions. However, many of the students uniformly assigned to foreign language departments are students with poor grades or older ages. They have no foreign language foundation, and some don't even know "A, B, C." Uniform distribution is necessary under certain circumstances, but specific circumstances should also be taken into account. Students who have a foundation in foreign languages and are interested in them can be allowed to voluntarily apply for foreign language departments, while students who are not suitable for learning foreign languages can also be allowed to voluntarily transfer to other departments. Only in this way can the quality of foreign language students be guaranteed. However, as a result of uniform distribution, those who can learn foreign languages cannot learn, and those who cannot learn foreign languages have to learn. A foreign language student at a certain university could not spell "Ma" no matter how hard he tried in the first few weeks of enrollment, and requested to transfer to another major many times before being approved after a long time.

    There is also a phenomenon of learning not being applied or application not being learned among the cadres trained by foreign language departments. Russian graduate students and teaching assistants who participated in the "Eighth National Congress" translation work not only could not help with translation, but sometimes even technical proofreading was difficult to handle. Some graduates of the foreign language department of Nankai University went to become physical education teachers, and some graduates of the Oriental Language Department of Peking University went to teach geometry in Tianjin, and some even went to Shenyang to work as accountants. Last year, more than 20 graduates of the Oriental Language Department of Peking University had not been assigned jobs by winter. This shows the serious situation of the separation of learning and application of foreign language cadres. The question of what kind of talents foreign language departments cultivate has not been satisfactorily resolved for a long time. If the main purpose is to cultivate cadres who have a basic grasp of foreign languages, to train teachers and general translation cadres, should some specialized talents for interpreting or translating that the country urgently needs also be appropriately cultivated? Some foreign language departments cancel translation practice, or have too little translation practice, only studying grammar or being proficient in language history and literary history, but not paying attention to the practicality of foreign languages. Is it appropriate for foreign language graduate students or associate doctors or doctors to be unable to speak, write, or translate? Cultivating foreign language cadres requires a certain amount of time and conditions. A foreign language cadre should be good at foreign languages ​​and also good at Chinese. They must understand various general knowledge and also understand some specialized knowledge. Interpreters must understand ancient and modern China and foreign countries, and a wide variety of things. Without enough time and appropriate conditions, it is impossible to cultivate excellent foreign language talents. Foreign languages ​​should be learned from middle school. Short-term training, crash courses, and blitzes cannot solve the problem well. Is the state's funding for cultivating foreign language cadres too little, are the equipment too simple, and is the treatment of teachers and students in foreign language colleges reasonable? These are all worth studying. There are many institutions for cultivating foreign language cadres, with complicated procedures, scattered teachers, and poor conditions. As a result, the training effect is not great, and the quality of graduates is not good. Is it possible to appropriately adjust these institutions, hand over the students who are suitable for centralized training to foreign language colleges for training, and even send the relatively idle translation cadres to foreign language colleges for further study? This is also worth studying.

    From the above situations, it can be seen that the problems existing in translation work and foreign language learning are serious. Of course, the so-called "there is no future in learning foreign languages, and there is no future in being a translator" is a wrong view. People in New China should not have such feelings of inferiority. The Party Central Committee attaches importance to translation work and foreign language cadres. Chairman Mao and many central leaders once comforted some translation comrades who participated in the "Eighth National Congress" translation work, which is one example. Naturally, translation work and translators and foreign language workers themselves also have shortcomings; translation institutions and foreign language colleges also have certain difficulties. However, based on the above-mentioned facts, it is indeed necessary to reverse the serious situation in translation work and foreign language teaching. First of all, the view of underestimating translation and foreign languages ​​should be overcome, attention should be paid to translation work and foreign language teaching, existing translation institutions and foreign language colleges should be strengthened and adjusted, foreign language cadres should be allocated and used reasonably, the treatment of translators and foreign language teachers should be improved, and the principles, years and teaching materials of foreign language teaching should be reviewed more comprehensively. A foreign language workers' association should be established through a national foreign language workers' conference, and publications should be published. As for whether it is necessary to establish a national institution that unifies the management of translation, or unifies the management of translation, foreign language teaching, and foreign language publishing, it is also worthy of consideration and further study.

    In this way, the situation will improve. At that time, not only will the children of foreign language professors be willing to learn foreign languages, but many young people will also go to learn foreign languages. More foreign language talents will be cultivated, and there will be more translation talents and research talents, and the quality of translation work and foreign language teaching will also be greatly improved. I think doing so is beneficial to our country's socialist construction.

    从“外语教授的子女不愿学外语”谈起
    陈昌浩
    不久前，有机会同高等学校的若干外语教授座谈了如何培养外语干部的问题，一位教授正颜厉色地说出这样一句话：“外语教授的子女都不愿意学外语。”乍一听，实在有点不敢相信。虽然不是所有外语教授的子女一定要学外语，也不是所有外语教授的子女都不学外语，但究竟为什么把外语当作毕生事业的教授的子女却不愿意学外语？为什么与外语同甘苦共呼吸的教授也不劝说自己的子女去学外语？为什么正在建设社会主义的中国的社会舆论不鼓励一些青年去学外语？实在有些想不通！
    是外语没有用处吗？不是。不学外语，怎样向世界先进水平看齐？不学外语，怎样向科学进军？不学外语，怎样把外国的一切名著翻译过来，又怎样把中国的著作翻译过去？不学外语，怎样同世界上一百多个国家打交道，怎样和那里的二十亿人民求得共同的语言？可见，外语的用处的确很大。
    是需要翻译的东西太少吗？不是。世界上的科学文化巨著极大多数还没有译成汉文。马克思、恩格斯的著作至少有三分之二还没有动手译，列宁的著作还有一半没有和中国人见面，马克思主义以前的及与之同时代的哲学和社会科学的重要著作绝大部分还没有译成汉文。现代和近代的许多有价值的自然科学著作也还没有汉文译本。可见，要译成汉文的东西实在不少。
    是我国的外语人才太多吗？是我们懂得的外语太多吗？也不是。我国外译汉的人才固然不够，而汉译外的人才更是寥寥无几。“八大”文件汉译外的工作经验证明：没有外国朋友的帮助，西班牙文就译不出来，俄文就译不好，德文、法文和日文就译不完善，英文虽比较有把握，但译文也需要加工；汉文译成多种外语几乎完全要靠解放前的老干部和解放后由国外回来的人担负，而解放后在国内培养出来的干部能够胜任的非常少，成千上万的新培养出来的外语干部，虽有一定的外语知识，但不会写像样的外文，说通顺的外语。我国在解放后有很多人学俄语，这是一种好现象，但有不少人却放弃英、德、法、日等外语的学习，也很少有人学东欧人民民主国家的语言；已经有人开始学西班牙语，但还没有人学葡萄牙语；也有人在学印度尼西亚语，但很少有人学阿拉伯语、印地语、乌尔都语和缅甸语。据统计，世界上操西班牙语的有二十三个国家，人口达一亿七千万，操阿拉伯语的有十七个国家，人口将近一亿，操印地语、乌尔都语的有印度、巴基斯坦约四亿三千万人口。也就是说，我们对世界上三分之一人口所用的各种语文还异常生疏。可见，我们的外语人才实在缺乏，我们懂得的外语实在太少。
      是翻译工作与科学研究无关吗？搞翻译工作就不能向科学进军吗？也不是。学外语的最终目的是为了与世界各国人民进行科学、文化交流和经济事务的联系，这一切都必须通过翻译。翻译工作不是简单技术性的工作，而是创造性的科学工作。就翻译本身来说，动手翻译以前必须全面探讨原著的内容、实质、社会历史背景，考核自己所不了解的每一概念和事实。就语文来说，不仅要懂得外文的结构和特点，要懂得本民族语文的结构和特点，而且还要懂得把一种语文译成另一种语文的规律和艺术。就研究工作来说，翻译前要研究原文的思想实质和表现形式，翻译时要研究最好的表达法，翻完后要研究译出的东西，从而丰富自己的理论知识和专业知识。通过翻译，可以为专业研究工作打下良好的基础，成为本学科的专家，可以成为语言学专家，也可以成为翻译专家。
    既然在我国外语的用处很大，外语人才很缺，要学的外语很多，作为科学研究工作的翻译工作又很重要，那为什么连外语教授的子女也不愿学外语呢？通过多次座谈，又经过一些调查之后，感到这中间的确有些原因。原因何在呢？且看下文。
    社会上对翻译工作和外语学习不够重视。解放七年来我国报章杂志上什么问题都谈到了，对徒工、保姆、护士、教师工作的重要性也谈到了，但对翻译工作和外语学习的重要性就没有真正提出过一次，连一篇关于这方面的社论也没有。几次全国人民代表大会会议上，节育问题也受到了应有的重视，但翻译工作和外语学习问题从来没有人谈到。今年号召青年投考高等学校时，几乎各种学科都有人在报刊上进行宣传，可是外语学院和翻译机构就没有人向青年人介绍本行本业的重要性。我国单是文艺刊物至少有一百多种，但是仅有的一种“翻译通报”不知为什么停刊之后，五年来这一类的刊物再也诞生不了。这样的现象该是如何的不合理！
    有不少的人轻视翻译工作和外语学习。“翻译还不是依照葫芦画瓢”——这是某某编辑同志对翻译的看法。“这个同志的业务水平很高，可惜是当翻译！”——有人向一位日文翻译同志这样说。“××教授，领导上考虑调你去担任德文口译，你是否感到有失身分？”——这位被调去的北京大学教授如此反映。“现在居然还有人学英文！”——一位相当负责的同志向北京大学英语教授感叹地说。这样的话又是如何令人泄气！
    有不少机关对翻译干部的待遇制度订得不合理。中国人民大学翻译室的翻译干部不能按行政级别享受应有的待遇，原来的翻译人员因调去当教员，有权在教员食堂吃饭，听报告时坐前排，而留下的翻译人员，反而没有这样的权利。至于翻译员的级别和工资都订得比较低，这恐怕是较为普遍的现象。有一位在哈尔滨外专毕业当翻译的同志在预备兵役登记时，不能作为高等学校毕业生列为军官，只能被登记为兵士，据说是“够不上技术人员”。这样的事也颇值得寻味。
    有不少单位对翻译干部使用不当，只使用，不培养。某设计院“把翻译人员像小卒一样乱摔，今天叫你搞机械加工，明天叫你搞采暖通风，后天又搞上下水道……翻译成了‘打杂’人员”。这想必是事实。在某设计院浪费翻译人力的现象极为严重，该院的一个科中，翻译力量据说有77％是浪费了的。把翻译人员当做“万能”，平时不培养他，事先不让他准备，翻译中出了错误，就斥责一通，这也不是个别的现象。无怪乎有人感叹地说：“开起会来骂的总是翻译，说翻译不行，可是谁也没有扪心自问，对翻译作了什么培养工作呢？实在有说不出的苦衷。”试问可以这样使用翻译干部吗？
    外语院系的新生质量、教学方针等等也不是没有问题的。为了加速社会主义建设，强调理工科系的新生质量是必要的，但对外语系的新生也要注意质量，也要记得“因材施教”的道理。在中学没有外语课的不利情况下，外语新生应该具备某些主观条件。可是统一分配到外语院系的学生，不少是成绩较差或年纪较大的人。他们没有任何外语基础，有人甚至连“A、B、C”都不知道。统一分配在一定情况下是必要的，但也要照顾到具体情况，对外语有基础有兴趣的学生，可以让他自愿报考外语院系，而不适宜于学外语的学生，也可以让他自愿转入他系，只有这样才可以保证外语学生的质量。可是统一分配的结果，能学外语的不能学，不能学外语的非学不可。某大学一位外语系学生在入学几星期内怎样也拼不出“Ma”来，请求转学多次，很久才被批准。
    外语院系培养出来的干部中也有学非所用或用非所学的现象。参加“八大”翻译工作的俄语研究生和助教，不但不能帮助翻译，有时技术校对也难于胜任。南开大学外语系毕业生有的去当体育教员，北京大学东语系毕业生有的到天津教几何，甚至有到沈阳去当会计的。去年北京大学东语系有二十多个毕业生到冬天还没有分配出去。这就说明外语干部学用脱节的严重情况。外语院系究竟培养什么人才的问题，长期没有圆满解决。如果主要是培养掌握外语基础的干部，培养师资和一般翻译干部，是否也要适当地培养一些国家所急需的口译或笔译的专门人才？有的外语系取消翻译实践，或翻译实践太少，只钻研语法或精通语言历史、文学史，而不讲求外语的实用性，作为外语的研究生或副博士、博士，既不能说，也不能写，又不能翻译，这是否妥当？培养外语干部是需要一定的时间和条件的。一个外语干部应该是外语好，中文也好，既要懂得各种普通知识，也要懂得一些专门知识，口译更要懂得古今中外，五花八门，没有足够的时间和适当的条件，就无法培养出优秀的外语人才。外语应该从中学学起，短期训练、速成、突击都不能很好解决问题。国家培养外语干部的经费是否太少，设备是否简陋，对外语院校师生的待遇是否合理，这都是值得研究的。培养外语干部的机构很多，头绪纷繁，师资分散，条件又差。结果，培养的效果不大，毕业生的质量不好。是否可以把这些机构适当加以调整，把适于集中培养的学生交给外语院校培养，连比较空闲的翻译干部也可以送到外语院校去进修，这也是值得研究的。
    从以上种种情况看来，翻译工作和外语学习中存在的问题是严重的。当然，所谓“学外语没有出息，当翻译没有前途”是一种错误的看法，新中国的人不应该有这样的自卑感。党中央是重视翻译工作和外语干部的，毛主席和许多中央负责同志曾慰问参加“八大”翻译工作的一部分翻译同志，即其一例。自然，翻译工作和翻译、外语工作者本身也是有缺点的；翻译机构和外语院校也是存在着一定的困难的。但是，根据上述的种种事实，目前的确也有必要扭转翻译工作和外语教学中的严重局面。首先应该克服轻视翻译和外语的观点，应该重视翻译工作和外语教学工作，加强和调整已有的翻译机构和外语院校，合理地分配和使用外语干部，改进翻译工作者和外语教学工作者的待遇，更全面地审订外语教学的方针、年限和教材等等。应该通过全国外语工作者会议成立外语工作者协会，并出版刊物。至于是否需要建立一个统一管理翻译，或统一管理翻译、外语教学和外文出版的国家机构，也是值得考虑和进一步研究的问题。
    这样，情况就会好转。那时不仅外语教授的子女愿意学外语，许多青年也会去学外语。外语人才培养得多，翻译人才、研究人才也就会多，翻译工作和外语教学的质量也会大大提高。我想，这样做对我国的社会主义建设事业是有好处的。
