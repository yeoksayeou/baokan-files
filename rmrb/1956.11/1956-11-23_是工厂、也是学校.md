    It's a Factory and a School
    Wu Jihua
    Recently, I visited a factory. This factory had only been built recently, but it had already successfully trial-produced a complex and precise new product, trained a large number of technical personnel, and started sending them to other factories.

              Self-Reliance and Bold Promotion
    The workers in this factory are very young, with young workers accounting for more than 80%. Most of them have junior high school or higher elementary school education. There are also very young master workers. There is a seventh-grade lathe operator in the machine repair workshop who is only twenty-five years old this year. In recent years, he has trained eight apprentices. Now these apprentices are all fourth- and fifth-grade skilled workers. The cadres here are also very young. Among the more than one thousand engineers and technicians, only about ten are over thirty years old, and the rest are only in their twenties, mostly students who graduated from universities, colleges, and secondary technical schools in recent years. After two to four years of production practice, they have initially mastered their professional skills. Many people have also learned many new techniques and complex technologies, such as precision casting, magnesium alloy casting and processing, standardized design, and so on. Among them, fifty-eight people have been awarded the title of engineer, and more than one hundred people can be used as reserve engineers. Many veteran cadres who have transferred to civilian work have also initially learned scientific methods for managing modern enterprises.
    This factory is relatively bold in promoting cadres. They believe that to train a cadre, you must first let him do the work; to train a person to become a certain type of cadre, you must let him do that type of work. The attitude of being afraid of everything cannot create cadres. In the past three or four years, they have trained more than seventy chief engineers (such as chief process engineers, chief metallurgical engineers, chief accountants, production directors, etc. - these people are responsible for leading several departments and workshops), section chiefs, and workshop directors from among the students who graduated from universities, colleges, and secondary technical schools, and more than one hundred office directors and group leaders. Six or seven hundred people have been promoted from workers to section chiefs, workshop directors, and foremen. More than one hundred people have been promoted to technicians. There was considerable resistance when these young cadres were promoted. This resistance mainly came from some comrades who were sticking to conventions and were short-sighted. They could not see the needs of national construction and development, nor could they see the fact that the cadres' talents were rapidly improving. At that time, the factory's Party committee vigorously criticized this erroneous understanding and basically overcame this resistance.

              Turning the Factory into a School
    The leading cadres of this factory attach great importance to the education and training of employees. They believe that this is not only a factory but also a school; it is necessary to manufacture products and train cadres; and to take "producing products and producing cadres" as their dual tasks to the country. On the one hand, they actively organize employees to learn in production practice; on the other hand, they have established formal part-time schools at all levels. At present, the number of people participating in various studies in the factory has reached more than 80% of the total number of employees. Learning has become a good habit. After work, people cannot be found in the offices, and there are few pedestrians on the streets. People are quietly attending classes in the classrooms of part-time schools. Following the policy of education serving production, they conduct production and technical education for employees in a variety of ways. There are technical study classes for workers, teaching contracts, advanced experience study classes, technical conferences for the same type of work, etc.; there are technical lectures for engineers and technicians, professional study groups, technical topic report meetings, etc. In formal part-time schools, there are three hundred people in night universities, more than one hundred people participating in correspondence courses in regular universities, more than six hundred people in night secondary vocational schools, and more than two hundred people in special classes (specially opened for leading cadres). More than seven thousand people are also participating in cultural studies from primary school to high school. These students have relatively good grades. In the first half of the year, the passing rate of the night university term exams reached 89%, and the special classes reached 95%. Now they are mobilizing more than 90% of employees to participate in various part-time studies. According to the factory's plan, by 1962, there will be two hundred and eighty night university graduates and six hundred and sixty night secondary vocational school graduates. Due to the factory's favorable conditions, these students can study and practice in production at the same time. These night university and night secondary vocational school graduates will not only have certain theoretical knowledge but also relatively rich production practice experience.
    Organizing such a large-scale part-time education is not without difficulties. Initially, some people accepted tasks from the higher authorities on the one hand, and asked the higher authorities for people on the other hand, believing that they were only responsible for production and not for training. Some people emphasized the contradiction between training and production, relying solely on working overtime to complete tasks, fearing that emphasizing part-time study would mean that no one would work overtime, which would affect the completion of tasks. The factory's Party committee criticized this erroneous thinking, and the factory administration also established training institutions at all levels. The factory has a deputy chief engineer for training, the workshops have full-time or part-time deputy directors for training, and the sections have part-time deputy section chiefs for training. This ensures that the training work can be managed and supervised by dedicated personnel from the grassroots level.

          Universal Improvement, Key Training
    When engineers and technicians have just graduated from school, they have only learned some basic principles and lack professional scientific and technical knowledge; many people have never even seen or heard of the products they are producing. Even workers who graduate from technical schools do not have much production experience. Therefore, universal improvement is needed. However, based on the factory's current production and production development requirements, key training is needed for engineers and technicians, leading cadres, and basic production workers on the basis of universal improvement.
    In implementing the policy of "universal improvement, key training," they mainly adopted the method of learning what they do and supplementing what they lack. For example: in the process of trial-producing new products, they first organized the factory's process personnel and design personnel to study the drawings and process regulations, and then passed them on to the workers. In this way, both cadres and workers have been greatly improved through the trial production of new products. For example: many students who have just graduated from universities and colleges originally studied general machining and lacked professional technical knowledge for manufacturing this product. The factory opened special study classes for them to learn professional technology. Veteran cadres who have transferred to civilian work mostly hold leadership positions in various departments, but they have a lower level of education and lack knowledge of production management and technical management. The factory allowed them to leave production to study culture for two years, raising them to the middle school level, and opened special classes in night universities to help them acquire the necessary knowledge to lead industrial enterprises.

      Fixing Special Personnel to Learn a Specialty from Soviet Experts
    This factory has dozens of Soviet experts, ranging from factory director consultants to process engineers. Therefore, organizing the learning from Soviet experts well has become an extremely important aspect of cadre training.
    In the past, this factory was somewhat laissez-faire in learning from Soviet experts, relying on experts everywhere, requiring experts to do most of the work themselves, and being unable to move an inch without experts. Later, according to the policy of "universal improvement, key training," they fixed leading cadres, engineers and technicians, and professional personnel in certain professional work positions and fixed special personnel to learn from Soviet experts. In fixing special personnel to learn from Soviet experts, key students and basic students were also divided. Key students include workshop directors, process office directors, chief process engineers, etc., and basic students include work section directors, section chiefs, process engineers, and directors and staff of various business offices, etc. Key students learn directly from Soviet experts, requiring them to be able to independently master their work before the Soviet experts return to their country and to teach basic students through them.
    In addition to implementing expert suggestions, the following methods were also adopted to learn from Soviet experts:
    (1) Formulate a learning plan.
    First, the Soviet experts put forward a training plan outline and compiled more detailed and specific learning outlines and test questions. The content mainly includes: product structure, production organization, process regulations, calendar operation plan, technical and economic plan, labor organization and labor wages, and product quality. Then, each section, workshop, and each student formulated a learning plan based on their specific situation and profession.
    (2) Under the guidance of Soviet experts, fixed key students gave lectures.
    After the learning outline and test questions were compiled, the fixed key students divided the tasks of preparing lessons and lecturing to basic students. When preparing lessons, the experts helped guide them. The lecturer gave the content to be lectured to the experts for a lecture first. The experts put forward opinions on the lecture content, and the lecturer revised it before lecturing to the basic students. The experts also listened to the lectures, and if the lecturer could not answer the questions raised by the students, the experts would give the lectures. There are many benefits to this learning method: the lecturer can independently study and think about the problems in production under the direct guidance of the experts. Therefore, the process of preparing and lecturing is a process of improvement for the lecturer himself. The lecturer imparts what he has learned from the experts and his own experience to others, which achieves the purpose of universal improvement. Because the lectures are conducted according to the profession in conjunction with production, everyone can apply what they have learned to their actual work.
    (3) Learning from experts in daily work in conjunction with production means sincerely asking experts for advice and learning how to solve problems when encountering practical problems in production. Soviet experts often say: What I want to teach you is not all the things in the textbooks, these you can read the books; what I want to teach is the things that cannot be found in the textbooks but are very necessary in actual work - production practice experience.
    (4) Organizing process personnel and workers to sign teaching contracts. They organized process personnel to help workers learn process regulations and drawings, and passed on the experts' experience to the workers through process engineers, and used waste materials for practice to improve the workers' technical level.
    (5) Conducting learning appraisal under the guidance of experts.
    In addition to conducting inspections in daily work, a learning appraisal is generally conducted for key students who are fixed to learn from experts before the experts return to their country to check the learning results of these comrades. The method of appraisal takes the form of thesis defense. First, the experts put forward the topics, and the key students write papers in conjunction with production practice. In the process of writing papers, the experts provide guidance and repeatedly revise them. The topics of the papers are all raised in conjunction with the problems existing in production. After the papers are written, the factory and workshop respectively organize an appraisal examination committee to conduct question-and-answer defense based on the reporter's paper under the guidance of the experts. The question-and-answer defense mainly examines the rationality of the paper and whether it is combined with reality. Now they have conducted factory and workshop appraisals for twenty-four key students. The appraisal results believe that these twenty-four people have been able to independently master their professional work. Some of the papers they have written have been used to guide production and have achieved good results.

    是工厂、也是学校
    吴济华
    最近，我到一个工厂去参观。这个工厂刚刚建成不久，就试制成功了一种复杂精密的新产品，同时培养了大批的技术人材，并且开始向别的工厂输送。
              自立更生，大胆提拔
    这个工厂的工人都是很年轻的，青年工人占80％以上，大多具有初中和高小文化程度。老师傅也有很年轻的。机修车间有一个七级车工，今年才二十五岁，近几年来已经培养了八个学徒。现在这些学徒都是四、五级的技术工人了。这里的干部也都很年轻，在一千多个工程技术人员中，三十岁以上的大约只有十个，其余都只有二十几岁，大多是最近几年从大学、专科和中等技术学校毕业的学生。经过二至四年的生产实践，他们已经初步掌握了自己的专业技术，很多人还学会了许多新的工艺和复杂的技术，像精密铸造、镁合金铸造和加工、规格化标准化设计等等。其中有五十八人获得了工程师的称号，还有一百多人可以作为后备工程师。许多转业的老干部也初步学会管理现代企业的科学方法。
    这个工厂在提拔干部上是比较大胆的。他们认为要培养一个干部，首先就要让他做工作，要培养一个人成为什么样的干部，就要让他做什么样的工作。前怕龙后怕虎的态度不能造就干部。三、四年来，他们从大学、专科和中等技术学校毕业的学生中培养了总师（如总工艺师、总冶金师、总会计师、生产长等，这样的人要负责领导好几个科室和车间）、科长和车间主任七十多人，室主任和组长一百多人。由工人提升为科长、车间主任和工长的有六、七百人。还有一百多人提升为技术员。在提拔这些年轻干部的时候，曾经遇到过相当大的阻力。这种阻力主要来自某些墨守成规，目光短浅的同志。他们看不清国家建设发展的需要，也看不清干部的才干迅速提高的事实。当时工厂党委有力地批判了这种错误认识，基本上克服了这种阻力。
              把工厂变成学校
    这个工厂的领导干部很重视对职工的教育和培养。他们认为这不仅是一座工厂，同时也是一座学校；既要制造产品，又要培养干部；把“出产品、出干部”作为自己对国家所负的双重任务。他们一方面积极组织职工在生产实践中进行学习，另方面举办了各级正规的业余学校。现在全厂参加各种学习的人数已经达到职工总数的80％以上。学习已经成为一种良好的风气，在下班以后，办公室里找不到人，马路上的行人也很少，人们都在业余学校的教室里安静地上课。他们按照教育为生产服务的方针，对职工进行生产技术教育的方式是多种多样的。有工人的技术学习班，教学合同，先进经验学习班，同工种技术会议等；有工程技术人员的技术讲座，专业学习小组，技术专题报告会等。在正规的业余学校中，夜大学有三百人，参加正规大学函授班的有一百多人，夜中等专业学校有六百多人，特别班（专为领导干部开设的）有二百多人。还有七千多人参加了从初小到高中的文化学习。这些学员的成绩都比较好，上半年夜大学期考成绩，及格率达到89％，特别班达到95％。现在他们正在动员90％以上的职工参加各种业余学习。根据工厂的规划，到1962年将有二百八十个夜大学毕业生和六百六十个夜中等专业学校毕业生。由于工厂的优越条件，这些学员能够一边学习、一边在生产中实习。这些夜大学和夜中等专业学校毕业生不仅将具有一定的理论学识，而且将具有比较丰富的生产实践经验。
    组织如此规模的业余教育，不是没有困难的。当初有些人一面从上级接受来任务，一面就向上级要人，认为自己只管生产，不管培训。有些人强调培训和生产的矛盾，单纯依靠加班加点来完成任务，怕强调了业余学习，没有人来加班加点，会影响任务的完成。工厂党委批判了这种错误思想，工厂行政也建立了各级培训机构，全厂设培训副总工程师、车间设专职或兼职的培训副主任，科设兼职培训副科长。这样使培训工作从基层起就能够有专人负责和管理。
          普遍提高，重点培养
    工程技术人员从学校刚刚毕业的时候，大都只是学了一些基本原理，缺乏专业的科学技术知识；许多人连所生产的产品见也没见过，甚至听也没听过。就是从技工学校毕业出来的工人，生产经验也不多。因此需要普遍提高。但是，根据工厂当前生产以及生产发展的要求，在普遍提高的基础上又需要以工程技术人员、领导干部和基本生产工人作为培养的重点。
    他们在贯彻“普遍提高、重点培养”的方针中，主要采取了做什么，学什么；缺什么，补什么的方法。例如：他们在试制新产品的过程中，首先组织全厂的工艺人员和设计人员学习图纸资料和工艺规程，然后通过他们传授给工人。这样通过新产品试制，干部和工人都得到了很大提高。又如：许多刚从大学和专科毕业的学生，原来学的是一般的机械加工，缺乏制造这种产品的专业工艺技术知识。工厂就为他们开设专门的学习班，使他们学会专业的工艺技术。转业的老干部，大多担负着各个部门的领导工作，但是他们的文化程度较低，缺乏生产管理和技术管理的知识，工厂就让他们脱离生产学习二年文化，提高到中学程度，并在夜大学中开设特别班，帮助他们获得领导工业企业的必要知识。
      固定专人专业向苏联专家学习
    这个工厂聘有从厂长顾问到工艺师成套的苏联专家几十个。因此，组织好向苏联专家学习，就成为培养干部的一个极其重要的方面。
    以前，这个工厂在向苏联专家学习上，是有些自流的，处处依赖专家，主要工作都要专家亲自动手，离开专家就寸步难行。后来，他们根据“普遍提高，重点培养”的方针，把领导干部、工程技术人员和专业人员都固定一定的专业工作岗位，并固定专人向苏联专家学习。在固定专人向苏联专家学习上，还划分了重点学员和基本学员。重点学员包括车间主任、工艺室主任、主任工艺员等，基本学员包括工段主任、工段长、工艺员和各业务室主任、业务员等。重点学员直接向苏联专家学习，要求他们在苏联专家回国之前，能够独立掌握工作，并通过他们去教会基本学员。
    向苏联专家学习的方法除了贯彻专家建议外，还采取了以下几种方法：
    （一）制订学习计划。
    先由苏联专家提出培养计划大纲，并编写较详细具体的学习提纲和试题。其内容主要有：产品构造、生产组织、工艺规程、日历作业计划、技术经济计划、劳动组织和劳动工资、产品质量。然后，各个科室、车间以及每个学员结合自己的具体情况和专业订出学习计划。
    （二）在苏联专家的指导下，由固定的重点学员讲课。
    学习提纲和试题编写以后，由固定的重点学员分工备课，向基本学员讲授。备课时专家帮助指导，由讲课人把要讲的内容先讲给专家听一遍，专家对讲课内容提出意见，讲课人修改后再向基本学员讲授。讲课时，专家也在旁边听，对学员提出来的问题，如果讲课人解答不了，就由专家来讲。这样的学习方法好处很多：讲课人能够在专家的直接指导下，结合生产中存在的问题，独立钻研思考。因此，备课讲课的过程，对讲课者本人就是一个提高的过程。讲课人把从专家学习到的东西以及自己的心得向别人传授，这样就达到了普遍提高的目的。由于讲课是按照专业结合生产进行的，大家就能够把所学到的东西运用到实际工作中去。
    （三）在日常工作中结合生产向专家学习，就是在生产中遇到实际问题时，切实请教专家，学会解决的办法。苏联专家常常说：我要教你们的不都是书本子上的东西，这些你们可以去看书；我要教的是书本子上找不到而在实际工作中又非常需要的东西——生产实践经验。
    （四）组织工艺人员和工人订立教学合同。他们组织工艺人员帮助工人学习工艺规程和图纸资料，通过工艺员把专家的经验传授给工人，并利用废料进行练习，以提高工人的技术水平。
    （五）在专家指导下，进行学习鉴定。
    对固定向专家学习的重点学员，除了在日常工作中进行考察外，在专家回国前，一般都要进行一次学习鉴定，以检查这些同志的学习成果。鉴定的方法采取论文答辩的方式。首先由专家出题目，重点学员结合生产实践写论文，在写论文的过程中，专家进行指导，反复修改。论文题目都是结合生产中存在的问题提出来的。论文写好后，工厂和车间分别组织鉴定考试委员会，在专家指导下，根据报告者的论文，进行质疑答辩。质疑答辩主要是考察论文的合理性和是否结合实际。现在他们已经对二十四个重点学员进行了工厂和车间鉴定。鉴定结果认为这二十四个人已经能够独立掌握自己的专业工作。他们所写的论文，有的已经用于指导生产，取得了良好的效果。
