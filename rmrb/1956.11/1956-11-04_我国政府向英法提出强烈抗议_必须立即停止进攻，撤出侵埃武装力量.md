Xinhua News Agency, 3rd. The following is the full text of the Chinese Government's protest to the British and French governments:

The Government of the People's Republic of China strongly protests the violent act of aggression by the British and French governments in threatening world peace and armed invasion of Egypt.

The British and French governments instigated Israel to attack Egypt and then used this attack as a pretext to launch their own armed offensive against Egypt. This is one of the most barbaric and shameful acts of aggression in history. The idea that this armed aggression is to ensure the freedom of navigation in the Suez Canal is absurd. It is precisely the armed aggression of Britain, France, and Israel under their direction that has destroyed all navigation in the canal and blocked the path to ensuring freedom of navigation in the canal through peaceful negotiations.

The British and French governments' armed aggression against Egypt is a gross violation of the United Nations Charter, a blatant challenge to the people of Asia and Africa, and a serious threat to world peace. This situation cannot but arouse the anger and protest of all peace-loving and justice-upholding countries and peoples.

The Chinese government considers it its duty to lodge a serious protest and warning to the British and French governments. The British and French governments must immediately cease all armed offensives against Egypt, must immediately withdraw all their armed forces that have invaded Egypt, the Israeli armed forces that have invaded Egypt under their direction must immediately withdraw behind the armistice line, and the issue of ensuring freedom of navigation in the Suez Canal must be resolved through peaceful negotiations. If the British and French governments dare to disregard the just condemnation and reasonable demands of the people of the world and insist on carrying out a war of aggression against Egypt, then they will inevitably face immeasurable serious consequences.

    我国政府向英法提出强烈抗议
    必须立即停止进攻，撤出侵埃武装力量
    新华社3日讯　中华人民共和国政府给英、法两国政府的抗议。全文如下：
    中华人民共和国政府强烈地抗议英、法政府威胁世界和平、武装进犯埃及的狂暴的侵略行为。
    英、法政府策动以色列进攻埃及，又利用这种进攻为借口，自己发动了对埃及的武装进攻。这是历史上一次最横蛮、最可耻的侵略行为。认为这种武装侵略是为了保证苏伊士运河的航行自由，是荒谬绝伦的。正是英、法和在它们指使之下的以色列的武装侵略破坏了运河的一切航行，并且堵塞了通过和平协商以保证运河航行自由的道路。
    英、法政府武装侵略埃及是对于联合国宪章的粗暴破坏，是对于亚非各国人民的公然挑战，是对于世界和平的严重威胁。这种情况不能不引起一切爱好和平和主持正义的国家和人民的愤怒和抗议。
    中国政府认为有责任向英、法政府提出严重的抗议和警告。英、法政府必须立即停止对埃及的一切武装进攻，必须立即撤出它们侵入埃及的一切武装力量，在它们指使下侵入埃及的以色列武装力量必须立即撤回到停战线后面，保证苏伊士运河航行自由的问题必须经过和平协商求得解决。如果英、法政府竟敢藐视世界人民的正义谴责和合理要求，坚持对埃及进行侵略战争，那末，他们就必然会面对不可估量的严重后果。
