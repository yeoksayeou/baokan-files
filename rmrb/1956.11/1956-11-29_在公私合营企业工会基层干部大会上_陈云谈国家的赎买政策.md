Xinhua News Agency, 28th: Vice Premier of the State Council, Chen Yun, proposed that a campaign of publicity and explanation regarding the redemption policy be widely conducted in state-private joint enterprises throughout the country.

This morning, at the General Assembly of Trade Union Grassroots Cadres in Joint State-Private Enterprises, Chen Yun reported that many employees of joint state-private enterprises still do not fully understand the significance of the redemption policy. However, in order to smoothly carry out the work of uniting and transforming capitalists in joint state-private enterprises, it is necessary to ensure that all employees have a clear understanding of the significance of the redemption policy and that everyone participates in this work.

In his report, Chen Yun analyzed in detail the necessity of the state's implementation of the redemption policy for capitalist industry and commerce from four aspects: First, the implementation of the redemption policy during the period of national economic recovery was beneficial to economic recovery. Second, providing capitalists with fixed interest for a certain period after joint management is necessary and beneficial to the country and the people. Third, the majority of the bourgeoisie possess production technology and management knowledge, and this technology and knowledge of theirs, as well as that of bourgeois intellectuals, is needed for socialist construction. Implementing the redemption policy can encourage them to serve socialist construction more actively. Fourth, China is building socialism in a large country with a population of 600 million, and construction work requires great prudence, striving for correctness. Appropriately transforming capitalism has significant international implications.

After analyzing the redemption policy, Chen Yun said that worker management committees should be restored and established in joint state-private enterprises. These committees should have certain powers but should cooperate with the public representatives.

Chen Yun said that in the past, trade unions and committees for increasing production and practicing economy in private enterprises absorbed the masses of workers to participate in management, playing a great role in promoting production and the socialist transformation of enterprises. After the establishment of joint state-private enterprises across the entire industry, this role has not been continued, and worker cadres have not been promoted sufficiently. This is an oversight in our work. In the future, management committees should be restored and established and given considerable power to work with public representatives to improve the production and management of enterprises.

When talking about the issue of the livelihood and welfare of employees in joint enterprises, Chen Yun said that it is necessary to improve the livelihood and welfare of employees in joint enterprises, but this can only be improved gradually on the basis of ensuring national construction, increasing production, and improving management, and it is impossible to improve it quickly.

Wang Rong, Director of the Wage Department of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, gave a report on the wage reform issues in the new joint state-private enterprises at the afternoon meeting.

    在公私合营企业工会基层干部大会上
    陈云谈国家的赎买政策
    新华社28日讯　国务院副总理陈云提议在全国公私合营企业广泛地进行一次对赎买政策的宣传解释工作。
    陈云今天上午在全国公私合营企业工会基层干部大会上报告说，目前不少公私合营企业的职工，对赎买政策的意义还不够了解，但是要顺利地在公私合营企业中做好团结和改造资本家的工作，就必须使全体职工明确认识赎买政策的意义，大家都来参加这一工作。
    陈云在报告中详细地从四个方面分析了国家对资本主义工商业实行赎买政策的必要性：一，在国民经济恢复时期，实行赎买政策对于经济恢复有利。第二，合营后一定时期给资本家的定息是必要的，对国家和人民是有利的。第三，资产阶级中的多数人是有生产技术和管理知识的，他们和资产阶级知识分子的这种技术和知识是社会主义建设所需要的，实行赎买政策可以鼓励他们更积极地为社会主义建设服务。第四，中国是在六亿人口的大国中建设社会主义，建设工作需要十分谨慎，力求正确。我们对资本主义改造得适当，是有重大国际意义。
    陈云在分析了赎买政策以后说，在公私合营企业中应该恢复和建立工人管理企业的委员会，这种委员会应该有一定的权力，但是应该同公方代表合作。
    陈云说，过去私营企业中的工会和增产节约委员会，吸收工人群众参加管理，对推动生产和企业的社会主义改造起了很大的作用。在全行业合营以后，这种作用没有被继续发挥，工人干部也还提拔得不够，这是工作中的一个疏忽。今后应该恢复和建立管理委员会，并赋以相当的权力，以便和公方代表在一起搞好企业的生产管理。
    在谈到合营企业职工生活福利问题的时候，陈云说，改善合营企业职工的生活福利是必要的，但是只能在保证国家建设、增加生产、改善经营的基础上逐步地改进，不可能改善得很快。
    中华全国总工会工资部部长王榕，在下午的会上作了关于新公私合营企业的工资改革问题的报告。
