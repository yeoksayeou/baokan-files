Xinhua News Agency, November 11th, Moscow dispatch from TASS: TASS was authorized on November 10th to issue a statement saying that Soviet leaders express a degree of satisfaction with the statements by the British, French, and Israeli governments that they have ceased military operations against Egypt. This decision by the three governments proves that they have finally listened to the voice of reason and yielded to the demands of the people of all countries who firmly condemn the aggression against Egypt.

The statement said that Soviet leaders pointed out: Stopping military operations against Egypt is a good thing, but they are also concerned whether this step taken by those who launched the war of aggression against Egypt is merely a trick, the purpose of which is to buy time and gain a respite in order to further concentrate their forces on a large scale, so as to restart a larger-scale war of aggression against Egypt and other countries in the Near East.

The basis for this concern is primarily the following facts: After the British, French, and Israeli governments issued statements on a ceasefire, British and French forces fiercely bombarded Port Said again, and dispatched new troops to land in this area. In addition, it can be seen from the official statements of the British and French governments that they are refusing to withdraw their troops stationed on Egyptian territory under various pretexts.

All of this forces the people of all countries to cautiously and vigilantly watch the schemes of the aggressors.

The Soviet people unanimously condemn the instigators of the war of aggression against the Egyptian people, and fully support the resolute measures taken by the Soviet government aimed at stopping the aggression against Egypt.

The statement said that the Soviet government has made its position clear in the letters from the Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers, Bulganin, to the leaders of the American, British, French, and Israeli governments, respectively, as well as in the letter to the Security Council. If the aggression against Egypt is not ended in accordance with the resolutions of the emergency session of the United Nations General Assembly, the Soviet Union is determined to implement the statements in the aforementioned letters.

The Soviet people are deeply concerned about the fate of peace and fully understand what consequences the expansion of military conflict will have if those who have committed aggression against Egypt are not rebuffed.

The fervent sympathy of the Soviet people for the Egyptian people, as well as for the people of other Eastern countries struggling for their national independence and freedom, is vividly manifested in the fact that Soviet citizens (including a large number of reserve pilots, tank drivers, artillerymen, and officers who participated in the Great Patriotic War) have applied for permission to go to Egypt as volunteers to fight alongside the Egyptian people and drive the aggressors out of Egyptian territory.

The Soviet Union has consistently advocated friendship, cooperation, and peaceful coexistence among all countries (regardless of their social systems). However, when this or that colonial country attempts to enslave by force an Eastern country that has already gained independence, thereby causing an international massacre, the Soviet people have never been passive bystanders.

The Soviet people also sympathize with those who are striving to get rid of the shameful shackles of colonialism and fight for independence. Therefore, the Soviet people condemn the colonialist war that is massacring the Algerian people.

The statement announced that Soviet leaders said that if Britain, France, and Israel violate United Nations resolutions and do not withdraw their troops from Egyptian territory, delay the implementation of this resolution under various pretexts, and accumulate strength, creating the danger of a resurgence of military action against Egypt, then the relevant Soviet authorities will not prevent Soviet citizens who voluntarily participate in the Egyptian people's struggle for independence from departing for Egypt.

### 塔斯社受权就埃及局势发表声明  警惕英法侵略者重新对埃及和近东进行大规模战争的阴谋  英法以如不撤军并重启战端苏联将不阻止志愿人员去埃及

    塔斯社受权就埃及局势发表声明
    警惕英法侵略者重新对埃及和近东进行大规模战争的阴谋  英法以如不撤军并重启战端苏联将不阻止志愿人员去埃及
    新华社11日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：塔斯社11月10日受权发表声明说，苏联领导人士对于英国、法国和以色列三国政府声明说它们已经停止对埃及的军事行动一点表示满意。三国政府的这种决定证明，它们终于听取了理智的呼声，终于向坚决指责侵略埃及的各国人民的要求让步了。
    声明说，苏联领导人士指出：停止对埃及的军事行动是件好事，同时也担心：那些发动侵略埃及战争的人采取这一步骤是否只不过是一种诡计，其目的在于争取时间和获得喘息的机会，来进一步大量集中兵力，以便重新对埃及和近东其他国家进行更大规模的侵略战争。
    这种担心的根据首先就是下列事实：在英国、法国和以色列三国政府发表了关于停火的声明以后，英国和法国的军队又猛烈轰击塞得港，并且派遣新的部队在这一地区登陆。此外，从英、法政府的官方声明中可以看出，他们正在各种各样的借口下拒绝撤出驻在埃及领土上的军队。
    所有这一切都使各国人民不得不谨慎地、警惕地注视着侵略者的阴谋。
    苏联人民一致谴责侵略埃及人民的战争的肇事人，并且完全支持苏联政府旨在制止侵略埃及的坚决措施。
    声明说，苏联政府已在苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁分别致美国、英国、法国和以色列政府领导人的信中以及在致安理会的信中表明了自己的立场。如果对埃及的侵略不依据联合国大会紧急会议的决议而结束，苏联决心实现上述信件中的声明。
    苏联人民深切关心和平的命运，并且十分了解，如果不给侵略埃及的人以反击，军事冲突的扩大将会造成怎样的后果。
    苏联人对埃及人民以及对为本国民族独立和自由而奋斗的其他东方国家人民的热烈同情，鲜明地表现在：苏联公民（其中包括大批后备役的飞行员、坦克手、炮兵和参加过伟大的卫国战争的军官）纷纷申请允许他们作为志愿人员前往埃及同埃及人民并肩战斗，把侵略者赶出埃及国土。
    苏联始终如一地主张各国（不管它们的社会制度如何）友好、合作和和平共处。但是，当这个或者那个殖民国家企图用武力奴役已经获得独立的东方国家，因而发生国际屠杀的时候，苏联人从来不是袖手旁观者。
    苏联人也同情那些致力于摆脱可耻的殖民主义枷锁和争取独立的人民。因此苏联人谴责屠杀阿尔及利亚人民的殖民主义战争。
    声明宣布，苏联领导人士说，如果英国、法国和以色列违背联合国决议不把军队撤出埃及领土、在种种借口下迟迟不执行这项决议并且积蓄力量，造成反对埃及的军事行动再起的危险，那么苏联有关机关将不阻止志愿参加埃及人民争取独立斗争的苏联公民出发去埃及。
