    Historical Specialty "Oil Spot Bowl"
    Our country's precious historical specialty, the "Oil Spot Bowl," is now back in production. This is a very interesting ceramic product, also known as "Song Porcelain Silver Nail Substitute." It has a small base and a large surface, is as black as ink and as bright as a mirror, with faint flowers and many oil spots inside. When you fill a bowl with water and look at it, it looks like oil drops are floating on the water surface, trembling with the water's ripples. This bowl originated in the early Northern Song Dynasty and was one of our export goods, but production ceased more than thirty years ago. In the winter of 1955, the No. 1 Production Cooperative of the Shenhou Town Porcelain Kiln in Yuxian County, Henan Province, invited back the old artisans, and the first batch has recently been fired.

    历史名产“油滴碗”
    我国珍贵的历史名产，“油滴碗”，现在又恢复生产。这是一种很有风趣的陶瓷制品，又名“宋瓷代银钉”。它的底小、面大，黑如墨、明如镜，内隐隐有花和许多油滴。如果你盛满一碗水看去时，像有油滴飘浮在水面上，随着水的波纹在抖动。这种碗创始于北宋初年，是我国出口货物之一，已经停产了三十余年。1955年冬，河南省禹县神后镇瓷窑生产一社，把过去老艺人请回来，最近已烧制出第一批。 　（张天正）
