    In recent days, the Chinese people have been following the news of Premier Zhou Enlai's friendly visit abroad with great excitement and pleasure. From the 18th to the 21st, Premier Zhou Enlai visited the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and held talks with Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Van Dong. In the joint communiqué issued by both sides, the two Premiers expressed their unanimous attitude towards current major international issues, reiterated their common determination to uphold the Geneva Accords and defend peace in Asia and the world, and particularly emphasized the need to further consolidate and develop the fraternal friendship between China and Vietnam.
    Vietnam is our close brotherly neighbor. The Chinese people have always held deep feelings and respect for the heroic Vietnamese people. We deeply cherish the long-standing and profound friendship between China and Vietnam, and regard the continuous strengthening of this friendship as a noble obligation. Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to Vietnam conveyed the Chinese people's high respect and cordial greetings to the Vietnamese people, and was also met with warm hospitality and grand welcome from the Vietnamese people. Through this visit and talks, mutual understanding between the two countries has been further deepened, and the fraternal friendship between the two peoples has been further strengthened. At a time when imperialism is seriously threatening peace in Asia, Africa, and the world, and when international reactionary forces are frantically provoking the socialist movement, the rock-solid solidarity between China and Vietnam is all the more significant. This solidarity not only conforms to the fundamental interests of our two peoples, but is also an important factor in maintaining peace in Asia and strengthening the strength of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union.
    The joint communiqué of the two Premiers fully embodies the noble spirit of a new type of international relations between socialist countries. The communiqué pointed out: "The two Premiers firmly support all measures conducive to enhancing the mutual relations between socialist countries and strengthening the solidarity between socialist countries. The two Premiers guarantee that in their mutual relations and their relations with other countries, they will strictly abide by the Five Principles and resolutely prevent chauvinistic errors." The Chinese people are willing to sincerely develop friendly relations with all countries forever on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. Because China is one of the world's major powers, our people should pay particular attention to preventing the ideology of great-power chauvinism. As Premier Zhou Enlai said: "Every nation and every country has its strengths and its worthy things to learn from." We must learn from the Vietnamese people and from the outstanding people of all countries.
    The joint communiqué pointed out the characteristics of the current international situation, that is: due to the aggressive acts and provocative activities of the imperialists, the international situation has become somewhat tense. However, peace-loving countries and people around the world are making tremendous efforts to strive for easing this tension. In response to this situation, the two Premiers firmly supported Egypt's just struggle, strongly condemned the armed aggression against Egypt by Britain, France, and their tool Israel, and demanded that they immediately and unconditionally withdraw their troops from Egypt. The two Premiers sternly denounced the imperialist conspiracies to subvert socialist countries and reiterated their support for the Hungarian Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government. This firm and consistent stance of the Chinese and Vietnamese people is a serious warning to the imperialists and a powerful support to the Egyptian people who are fighting against colonialist aggression and to the Hungarian people who are consolidating their people's democratic system.
    As a participating country in the Geneva Conference and a neighbor of the Indochinese countries, China is very concerned about the consolidation of peace in Indochina and the implementation of the Geneva Accords. The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has consistently and strictly abided by the Geneva Accords, made unremitting efforts to strive for free general elections throughout Vietnam in accordance with the Geneva Accords, and repeatedly put forward proposals for both sides to negotiate the restoration of normal relations between North and South Vietnam. However, the United States and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique have tried every means to obstruct and undermine the Geneva Accords, resulting in the failure of the free general elections in Vietnam to be held as scheduled. Not only that, the United States has also continuously transported large quantities of military materials into South Vietnam in an attempt to divide Vietnam for a long time and turn South Vietnam into its colony and military base. This situation has brought increasing threats to peace in Indochina and Asia, and has therefore aroused the close attention of the Vietnamese people, the Chinese people, and the people of Asian countries. In the joint communiqué, the two Premiers once again called on the countries participating in the 1954 Geneva Conference to take joint and effective measures to seek the thorough realization of the Geneva Accords. This is a new effort by China and Vietnam to uphold the Geneva Accords and consolidate peace in Indochina.
    The Chinese people resolutely support the Vietnamese people in their economic construction and their struggle for the peaceful reunification of their motherland. We firmly believe that the Vietnamese people, who have already won great victories in the struggle to consolidate North Vietnam, will surely be able to realize the historical task of building a peaceful, unified, independent, democratic, and prosperous Vietnam.

    不断地加强中越两国的兄弟友谊
    这几天来，中国人民以十分兴奋和愉快的心情关怀着我国国务院总理周恩来出国进行友好访问的消息。从18日到21日，周恩来总理访问了越南民主共和国，并同越南政府总理范文同举行了会谈。在双方发表的联合公报中，两国总理表示了对当前重大国际问题的一致态度，重申了对于维护日内瓦协议、保卫亚洲和世界和平的共同决心，并特别强调要进一步巩固和发展中越两国的兄弟友谊。
    越南是我们亲密的兄弟邻邦。中国人民对于英雄的越南人民一向怀着深刻的感情和敬意。我们十分珍视中越两国悠久和深厚的友谊，并把不断加强这种友谊看成是自己的一项崇高义务。这次周恩来总理访问越南，转达了中国人民对越南人民的崇高敬意和亲切的问候，同时也受到了越南人民的殷勤接待和盛大的欢迎。通过这次访问和会谈，两国之间的相互了解进一步加深了，两国人民之间的兄弟友谊更加加强了。当帝国主义正在严重威胁亚非和世界和平的时候，当国际反动势力正疯狂地向社会主义运动进行挑衅的今天，中越两国这种坚如磐石的团结就更加显示了它的作用。这种团结不仅符合我们两国人民的根本利益，而且对维护亚洲和平和加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的力量也是一个重要的因素。
    两国总理联合公报充分体现了社会主义国家新型国际关系的崇高精神。公报指出：“两国总理坚决支持一切有助于增进社会主义国家相互关系和加强社会主义国家之间的团结的措施。两国总理保证，在他们两国的相互关系中和他们同其他国家的关系中，将严格遵守五项原则、坚决防止沙文主义的错误。”中国人民愿意永远真诚地在和平共处的五项原则基础之上同一切国家发展友好关系。由于中国是世界大国之一，我国人民就更应该特别注意防止大国沙文主义的思想。正同周恩来总理所说：“每一个民族，每一个国家都有它的长处，都有它值得学习的地方。”我们要向越南人民学习，向一切国家的优秀人民学习。
    联合公报指出了目前国际局势的特点，这就是：由于帝国主义者的侵略行为和挑衅活动，国际局势有了某些紧张。但是，世界爱好和平的国家和人民正在为争取和缓这种紧张局势而进行巨大的努力。针对着这种形势，两国总理坚决支持埃及的正义斗争，并强烈地谴责英、法和它们的工具以色列对埃及的武装侵略，要求它们立即无条件地从埃及撤出军队。两国总理严厉地揭斥了帝国主义颠复社会主义国家的阴谋活动，重申对匈牙利工农革命政府的支持。中越两国人民这种坚定一致的立场，对于帝国主义者是一个严重的警告，对于正在为反抗殖民主义侵略而斗争的埃及人民和正在巩固人民民主制度的匈牙利人民，是有力的声援。
    作为日内瓦会议的参加国和印度支那各国的邻邦，中国十分关心印度支那和平的巩固和日内瓦协议的实施。越南民主共和国政府一贯严格遵守日内瓦协议，为了争取根据日内瓦协议在越南全国进行自由普选作了不懈的努力，并且屡次提出了关于双方协商恢复越南南北正常关系的建议。但是，美国和吴庭艳集团却千方百计地阻挠和破坏日内瓦协议，致使越南的自由普选未能如期举行。不仅如此，美国还不断地把大批军事物资运进南越，企图长期分裂越南，把南越变成它的殖民地和军事基地。这种情况已经给印度支那和亚洲的和平带来了越来越大的威胁，因而引起了越南人民、中国人民和亚洲各国人民的密切注意。在联合公报中，两国总理再次呼吁参加1954年日内瓦会议的国家应该采取共同的有效措施，谋求日内瓦协议的彻底实现。这是中越两国对于维护日内瓦协议、巩固印度支那和平的新的努力。
    中国人民坚决支持越南人民进行经济建设和争取祖国和平统一的斗争。我们深信，在巩固越南北方的斗争中已经获得巨大胜利的越南人民，一定能够实现建立一个和平、统一、独立、民主和繁荣的越南的历史任务。
