Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 24th: The Liushahe Agricultural Cooperative in Ningxiang County, Hunan Province, with 713 households, raises an average of more than eight pigs per household.

Liushahe is a well-known Ningxiang pig breed production area in Hunan Province. Before the establishment of the cooperative last winter, these 713 farm households had only 365 pigs in stock. After the establishment of the cooperative, the whole cooperative focused on developing rice production while simultaneously developing pig farming. Currently, the entire cooperative raises a total of 6,086 pigs, of which 700 are raised collectively by the cooperative and 5,386 are raised privately by members. Within half a year, the income from selling pigs reached more than 24,000 yuan. The cooperative extracted more than 1,000 yuan from the income from selling pigs to buy back a large number of farm tools and fertilizers. The accumulated large amount of pig manure also played a significant role in this year's rice harvest. The income of more than 90% of the members of the cooperative has increased. 562 members have made new clothes, and 49 members have built new houses.

In developing pig farming, the most important thing for the Liushahe Agricultural Cooperative is to find ways to help members solve the feed problem. The leaders of the cooperative not only appropriately adjusted the members' private plots, but also lent 70 mu of winter fallow land to the members in the autumn to grow feed crops. Duckweed and water hyacinths were also stored in the ponds as feed. As a result, the entire cooperative only bought 23,000 jin of commercial feed in ten months. The cooperative also mobilized members to formulate collective and individual pig-raising plans. Eighty-two households did not raise pigs due to lack of funds, so the cooperative and their relatives and neighbors lent pigs to them. The cooperative raises 700 sows, which have bred more than 4,000 piglets in ten months. In addition, the cooperative always adheres to the principle of running the cooperative diligently and thriftily. The newly built sixteen pig sties were built with old tree branches and old bricks and other materials, costing less than 60 yuan.

    流沙河农业社发展养猪业
    平均每户养猪八只
    新华社长沙24日电　湖南省宁乡县流沙河农业社七百一十三户社员，平均每户养猪八只以上。
    流沙河是湖南省著名的宁乡良种猪产地。去年冬季建社以前，这七百一十三户农民家里存栏的猪只有三百六十五只。建社以后，全社就以发展稻谷生产为主，同时发展养猪事业。到现在，全社共养猪六千零八十六头，其中由社集体喂养七百头，社员私养五千三百八十六头。半年内，卖猪的收入达到两万四千多元。全社从卖猪的收入中抽出一千多元，买回了大批农具和肥料，积聚的大量猪粪，对于今年的稻谷丰收也起了很大的作用。全社90％以上的社员收入都增加了，有五百六十二户社员做了新衣服，有四十九户社员盖了新房子。
    流沙河农业社在发展养猪事业中，最重要的是设法帮助社员解决饲料问题。社的领导方面不但适当地调整了社员的自留地，而且在秋季把七十亩冬闲田借给社员们种植饲料作物。水塘里又蓄了浮萍和水仙花，作为饲料。因此，十个月来全社只买了两万三千斤商品饲料。社里还发动社员分别制定集体的和个人的养猪计划，有八十二户因为缺少资金而没有喂猪，社里和他们的亲戚邻居就借猪给他们养。全社养七百只母猪，十个月内共繁殖了四千多只小猪。此外，这个社始终坚持执行勤俭办社的方针。新建的十六间猪栏，都是利用旧树条和旧砖等材料筑成的，开支不到六十元。
