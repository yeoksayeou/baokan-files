    Congratulations to "Golden Star" and Other Cooperatives

    Suffering from natural disasters is truly unfortunate. However, in our era, this is no longer such a terrible thing.

    It is not terrible, not only because of the support of the government and the people of all regions; more importantly, after the peasants organized themselves, the peasants themselves also increased their great fighting spirit and strength.

    This year, "Golden Star" and two other cooperatives in Pingshun County, Shanxi Province, suffered several disasters in a row, but the total output value still exceeded the 1957 plan, ensuring that more than 90% of the members increased their income.

    We sincerely congratulate them on their victory. This is the victory of the socialist economic system.

    向“金星”等社致贺
    遭受了自然灾害，这真是不幸的事情。可是，在我们这个时代，这已经不是多么可怕的事情了。
    不可怕，不只因为有政府和各地人民的支援；更重要的是农民组织起来以后，农民自身也增加了巨大的斗志和力量。
    山西省平顺县“金星”等三个社，今年连续遭受了几种灾害，总产值仍然超过了1957年的计划，保证了90％以上的社员增加收入。
    我们衷心祝贺他们的胜利，这是社会主义经济制度的胜利。
