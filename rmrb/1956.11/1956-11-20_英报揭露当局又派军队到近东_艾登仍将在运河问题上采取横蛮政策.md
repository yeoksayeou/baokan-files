    英报揭露当局又派军队到近东
    艾登仍将在运河问题上采取横蛮政策
    新华社19日讯　据塔斯社伦敦18日讯：据星期日的“人民报”报道，英国政府又在派遣几百名后备军人到近东去。
    报纸说，驻扎在索耳兹伯里平原布耳福德兵营的数百名后备军人已经在17日晚上得到命令向海外开发。他们现在都已经准备妥当。出发日期定在11月19日。
    新华社伦敦19日电“星期日快报”18日报道，艾登将继续在苏伊士问题上采取强硬政策。他坚持必须使用英法打捞队来清理运河，而且主张联合国部队必须“保护”整个苏伊士运河，而不是仅仅作为埃及部队和以色列部队之间的缓冲力量。
    这家报纸说，如果埃及拒绝的话，英法两国便将“作出强硬决定”，以“进逼和占领运河的其他部分”。
