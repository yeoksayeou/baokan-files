Xinhua News Agency, 12th—"The Exhibition of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's Life and Deeds" opened today in the "Sun Yat-sen Hall" in Zhongshan Park, Beijing. The banner hanging in front of the hall with the inscription "Exhibition of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's Life and Deeds" was personally inscribed by Chairman Mao Zedong.

The "Sun Yat-sen Hall" is a wooden structure built five hundred and thirty years ago. Thirty-one years ago, after Mr. Sun Yat-sen passed away, his coffin was placed here temporarily. At that time, many revolutionary patriots and members of the public came to pay their respects, but they were monitored by the reactionary government's military police. Today, a large-scale commemorative exhibition is held here, and people are eagerly coming to visit with reverence and affection.

More than 300 photos and many cultural relics are on display at the exhibition, systematically introducing Mr. Sun Yat-sen's lifelong revolutionary activities. Many of the exhibits were originally treasured for decades by Mr. Sun Yat-sen's comrades-in-arms and followers. They were sent here for exhibition to commemorate the ninetieth anniversary of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's birth. Among them, a batch of precious cultural relics were recently sent from Shanghai by Madam Soong Ching Ling. Mr. Sun Yat-sen's handwritten manuscript of "Fundamentals of National Reconstruction" written in 1924, as well as handwritten letters and calligraphy, are displayed in glass cabinets. The exhibition also displays the commemorative badges of the Chinese Revolutionary Party treasured by Mr. Peng Zemin, and the bonds and donation badges issued by the Chinese Revolutionary Party among overseas Chinese, which were sent by Mr. Peng Zemin's family.

Also on display are many historically significant photos and documents from the First National Congress of the Chinese Kuomintang and around the time of the congress.

A graduate student from a university in Beijing contributed valuable photos of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's congratulatory telegram to Lenin after the success of the October Socialist Revolution and the elegiac inscription "National Friend and Teacher" written by Mr. Sun Yat-sen in 1924 to commemorate Lenin. These cultural relics express the profound friendship of the Chinese people towards the Soviet Union.

Many visitors expressed their high respect for this great revolutionary pioneer. While visiting, Cheng Qian and Ye Gongchuo talked about the situation after the Xinhai Revolution where Mr. Sun Yat-sen, representing the forces of democratic revolution, continued his unremitting struggle against the Northern Warlords who were manipulated by imperialism, while looking at the photos and documents of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's campaign against Yuan Shikai and the Movement to Protect the Constitution. Shao Lizi, the Secretary-General of the Preparatory Committee for the Ninetieth Anniversary of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's Birth, visited the exhibition before its official opening. After the visit, he said that this is the best classroom for learning Mr. Sun Yat-sen's great patriotic ideology and anti-imperialist fighting spirit.

Xinhua News Agency, 12th—This afternoon, more than 3,000 people from all walks of life in the capital visited "The Exhibition of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's Life and Deeds."

While visiting, the audience listened to the recorded speeches "Encouraging the People" and "Admonishing Comrades" delivered by Mr. Sun Yat-sen in 1924, which were broadcasted at the exhibition. The younger generation was very excited to hear Mr. Sun Yat-sen's voice for the first time. The audience was very attentive during the visit, and some even took notes on Mr. Sun Yat-sen's deeds. An elderly man read Mr. Sun Yat-sen's letter to Chiang Kai-shek advocating learning from Russia, displayed in the glass cabinet, word by word, showing excitement.

Among the visitors were members of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in Beijing, deputies of the National People's Congress in Beijing, and leaders of various democratic parties.

Today, more than 12,000 workers, cadres, and students have registered with the exhibition requesting to visit.

    “孙中山先生生平事迹展览会”在北京开幕
    新华社12日讯“孙中山先生生平事迹展览会”，今天在北京中山公园的“中山堂”开幕。挂在堂门前的“孙中山先生生平事迹展览会”的横幅，是毛泽东主席的亲笔题字。
    “中山堂”是一座五百三十年前建筑的木构大殿。三十一年前，孙中山先生逝世后曾停灵在这里。当时许多革命志士和群众来致祭，却受到当时反动政府军警的监视。今天这里举行了大规模的纪念展览会，人们怀着崇敬和爱戴的心情踊跃地前来参观。
    在展览会上，陈列的三百多幅照片和许多文物，系统地介绍了孙中山先生毕生从事革命活动的情形。展出的许多物品，原是孙中山先生的战友和跟随者珍藏了几十年的。为了纪念孙中山先生诞生九十周年，他们才送到这里来展览。其中，有宋庆龄先生最近从上海送来的一批珍贵文物。孙中山先生在1924年亲笔写的“建国大纲”的手稿和影印的手札、墨迹等都陈列在玻璃柜内。展览会上还陈列着彭泽民先生家属送来的彭先生珍藏的中华革命党纪念章和中华革命党在海外侨胞中发行的债券、义捐证章等物品。
    这里还陈列着中国国民党第一次全国代表大会及大会前后许多富有历史意义的照片、文献。
    北京一个大学的研究生献出了孙中山先生在十月社会主义革命成功后给列宁的贺电和1924年孙中山先生为追悼列宁而亲笔书写的挽额“国友人师”等珍贵的照片。这些文物表达了中国人民对苏联的深厚友谊。
    许多参观者对这位伟大的革命先行者表示了崇高的敬意。程潜和叶恭绰在参观时，一边看着孙中山先生讨袁、护法运动的照片和文献，一边谈着辛亥革命后中山先生代表民主革命的力量继续和帝国主义操纵下的北洋军阀进行不懈斗争的情形。纪念孙中山先生诞辰九十周年筹备委员会秘书长邵力子在正式开幕前就参观了展览会，他在参观后说，这里是学习孙中山先生伟大的爱国思想和反对帝国主义的战斗精神的最好课堂。
    新华社12日讯　今天下午，首都各界有三千多人参观了“孙中山先生生平事迹展览会”。
    观众们在参观时听到了展览会播送的中山先生1924年发表的“勉励国民”和“告诫同志”的演说录音。后辈的年轻人第一次听到中山先生的声音都很兴奋。观众们在参观时都很认真，还有些人在笔记本上记下了中山先生的事迹。有个老年人看到玻璃柜内陈列的孙中山先生给蒋介石的主张以俄为师的信札，一字一句地念着，显出了激动的心情。
    在参观的人群中，有中国人民政治协商会议在京的委员、全国人民代表大会在京代表和各民主党派的负责人。
    今天，已经有一万二千多名工人、干部和学生向展览会登记要求参观。
