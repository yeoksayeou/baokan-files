(Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, November 16th) The Hungarian government and working people are fighting against activities that obstruct the resumption of work in their efforts to restore normal life.

In recent days, many industrial enterprises in Hungary, especially local industrial enterprises, have mostly begun to resume production. However, the counter-revolutionaries are still making desperate struggles, trying to obstruct the normalization of domestic life. They are distributing inflammatory leaflets and appeals in Budapest, attempting to undermine the prestige of the worker-peasant revolutionary government, spreading provocative rumors, and doing everything possible to hinder the elimination of the consequences of the fascist rebellion. Some counter-revolutionaries and irresponsible people are also hindering workers from returning to work. Terrorists even threaten workers, saying: "Whoever goes to work will be killed." Some factories, after resuming work, are still threatened by counter-revolutionary thugs. For example, the "Shixin" shoe factory was threatened by thugs who broke into the factory from outside on the 12th and 13th, saying that if they continued to work, they would throw grenades.

Some people are also taking advantage of the shortage of certain commodities to speculate, trading at black market prices, undermining the purchasing power of the Forint (Hungarian currency), and hindering the country from quickly recovering from the chaos.

However, the honest workers who have sobered up after the counter-revolutionary riots clearly realize the harm that disrupting production will cause to the country and themselves. They are very indignant at these activities of the counter-revolutionary thugs and have demanded and insisted on resuming work.

The workers of the Hungarian Optical Instrument Factory wrote a letter to the worker-peasant revolutionary government, listing many facts of counter-revolutionaries' lawlessness, disruption of order, and sabotage of production in many factories, and demanding that the government "use the iron fist of the workers' regime" to severely suppress the counter-revolutionaries. They also put forward many important suggestions for stabilizing social order.

At the same time, representatives of the Budapest Workers' Council held negotiations with the government on the 14th and 15th regarding issues related to ensuring normal production.

Hungarian railway workers are actively returning to work. In recent days, trains have arrived in Budapest from Debrecen and Szolnok in the east, from Pécs in the south, and from Szombathely in the west. The trains are continuously transporting grain from all over to supply the people of the capital.

Passenger transport by rail has also begun. On the 12th, trains carrying passengers departed from Budapest to Cegléd, Esztergom, and Székesfehérvár.

Several hundred carloads of coal have been mined in the Borsod coal mine and the Totobanya coal mine. In the Szolnok region, factories have resumed work in recent days, and 50% to 60% of the workers in factories and larger enterprises have started working. Traffic in this area has also partially resumed.

    匈牙利人民努力恢复正常生活
    积极对阻挠复工的活动进行斗争
    据新华社布达佩斯16日电　匈牙利政府和劳动人民在努力恢复正常生活的工作中，正在同阻挠复工的活动进行斗争。
    近几天来，匈牙利许多工业企业，特别是地方工业企业大都开始恢复生产了。然而反革命分子还在进行绝望的挣扎，力图阻挠国内生活正常化。他们在布达佩斯散发煽惑性的传单和号召书，企图破坏工农革命政府的威信，散布挑拨性的谣言，千方百计地阻挠消除法西斯叛乱的后果。有些反革命分子和不负责任的人还阻挠工人们复工。恐怖分子甚至威胁工人说：“谁要上班就杀死谁”。有些工厂复工后，仍然受到反革命暴徒的威胁，如“时新”皮鞋工厂12日和13日两天在开工中，都曾有暴徒从厂外闯进来威胁工人说，假使再继续工作，他们就要掷手榴弹了。
    有些人还利用某些商品的缺乏进行投机，以黑市价格计算交易，破坏福林（匈币名）的购买力，阻挠国家迅速地从混乱中恢复过来。
    但是，在反革命分子制造暴乱后清醒过来的正直的工人们，清楚地认识到破坏生产会给国家和自己造成怎样的危害。他们对反革命暴徒的这些活动很愤慨，纷纷要求和坚持复工。
    匈牙利光学仪器工厂的工人写了一封信给工农革命政府，列举了许多工厂中反革命分子胡作非为、破坏秩序、破坏生产的事实，要求政府“使用工人政权的铁拳”，严厉镇压反革命分子。他们还提出了许多安定社会秩序的重要建议。
    同时，布达佩斯工人委员会的代表在14、15两天内，就有关保证正常生产的问题同政府举行了谈判。
    匈牙利铁路工人正在积极回到工作上去。最近几天，已经有火车从东部得布勒森、索尔诺克，从南部贝奇和西部的松巴西利通到首都布达佩斯。列车装载着粮食从各地源源不断地运来供应首都人民。
    铁路的客运也已经开始。12日已经有火车从布达佩斯载着旅客开往策格累德、爱斯杰格姆和塞克什费黑瓦尔等地。
    在包尔绍德煤矿和托托巴尼奥煤矿已经开采几百个车皮的煤。在索尔诺克地区，最近几天来工厂恢复了工作，在工厂和较大企业内，50％到60％的工人开始工作。这个地区的交通也部分恢复了。
