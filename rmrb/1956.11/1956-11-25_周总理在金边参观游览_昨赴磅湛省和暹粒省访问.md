Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, November 24th: Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier He Long, and their entourage drove through dense crowds of cheering people on the afternoon of the 23rd to visit some cultural and educational facilities in this bustling city.

    They first visited the Royal School of Medicine, accompanied by Secretary of State for Public Health, Yem Sarong. After learning about the school's development, Premier Zhou congratulated the school authorities.

    Zhou Enlai and He Long then went by car to the Preah Ang Yavann Museum. The extraordinarily precious ancient relics displayed in this palace-like building were greatly admired by the visitors.

    Later, Secretary of State for National Education, Yim Dith, led the guests to visit the School of Fine Arts. Mayor of Phnom Penh, Mey Koun, and the Premier traveled from there by car to the disaster relief station established by the Chinese Red Cross Society and the Khmer National Relief Association outside the city and other places. However, due to the late hour, the visitors did not get out of the car after arriving at these locations. At the Norodom Sihanouk Vocational Education Institute, a large crowd stopped and surrounded the Premier's car. Amid applause, girls presented him with flowers.

    The Chinese Premier's visit has made the entire city jubilant. Inside the city, the roadsides along the routes that the Premier and his entourage were expected to pass were lined with crowds who were willing to stand in the tropical heat for hours to catch a glimpse of the distinguished Chinese guests. Whenever a car carrying the distinguished Chinese guests passed by, they applauded, while people on the balconies along the streets waved. Large crowds waited in front of the Royal Palace and the Government House long after sunset. In the suburbs, thousands of people crowded along the sides of the roads, even in places where there were no nearby villages. Overseas Chinese also stood among these welcoming crowds, eagerly looking at the "relatives from the motherland."

    Regarding this grand occasion, local newspapers commented that "Cambodia has never given such a grand welcome to its guests in history."

    Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, November 22nd: (Delayed) When Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier He Long, and their entourage toured the urban area of Phnom Penh at 6:00 PM on November 22nd, tens of thousands of people in the Cambodian capital once again poured into the streets to welcome them.

    Premier Zhou Enlai, accompanied by Mayor Mey Koun, rode in an open-top car through the city center and main streets. The masses waved Cambodian and Chinese flags to welcome them and gave thunderous applause.

    This city on the banks of the Mekong River presented a festive atmosphere today; its streets and suburbs were filled with national flags and banners welcoming the visiting Chinese Premier.

    After touring the city for an hour, Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier He Long, and their entourage returned to the Royal Palace to rest. The welcoming crowds on the streets did not disperse until long after they had left.

    Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, November 24th: Premier Zhou Enlai and his party, accompanied by Prince Sihanouk, left for Kampong Cham Province and Siem Reap Province by Cambodian Royal Armed Forces military aircraft at 7:20 this morning for a visit.

    As the cars carrying Premier Zhou and Prince Sihanouk passed through the streets of this beautiful capital, tens of thousands of Phnom Penh citizens waiting along the road warmly applauded and cheered them. Since Premier Zhou arrived in Phnom Penh, this enthusiastic mass welcome scene has not stopped.

    Those who saw them off at Phnom Penh Airport included: Ministers of the Cambodian Royal Government and other senior officials; a detachment of the Royal Air Force paid tribute to the distinguished guests.

    The Kampong Cham Provincial Government and people from all walks of life organized a grand welcome to receive the guests.

    后来，国民教育国务秘书严迪领着客人访问了美术学校。金边市长梅昆和总理从那里乘车到城外的由中国红十字会和高棉国家救济总会设立的灾民救济站和其他地方去。但是由于时间已晚，访问者到达这些地方以后没有下车。在西哈努克工艺教育所，大群的人把总理的车子拦住围起来。在鼓掌声中，少女向他献了花。
    中国总理的来访，使整个城市欢腾起来。在城内，在总理和他的随行人员预计要经过的道路上，两旁到处是人群，他们为了看一看中国贵宾，宁愿在热带炎热的太阳下，站上几个小时。只要有中国贵宾乘坐的汽车驶过，他们就鼓起掌来，而在街道两旁阳台上的人们则挥手致意。大群的人在日落以后很久还守候在客人逗留的王宫和政府大厦的前面。在郊区，成千的人拥挤在道路的两旁，甚至在附近没有村庄的地方也是这样。华侨也站在这些欢迎的人群中，他们怀着最急切的心情来看一看“来自祖国的亲人”。
    对于这样的盛况，当地的报纸评论说，“柬埔寨在历史上从来也没有对它的客人给予过这样大的欢迎”。
    新华社金边22日电　（迟到）周恩来总理、贺龙副总理和随行人员11月22日下午六时在金边市区游览时，柬埔寨首都成千上万的人再次涌到街上来欢迎他们。
    周恩来总理同市长梅昆乘敞篷汽车经过市中心区和主要街道，广大群众挥舞着柬埔寨和中国国旗欢迎他们，并且发出了雷鸣般的掌声。
    这个位于湄公河畔的城市今天呈显出了节日气氛；它的街道上和郊区到处挂着国旗和横幅标语欢迎来这里访问的中国总理。
    周恩来总理、贺龙副总理和随行人员在市内游览了一个小时以后回到王宫休息。街上的欢迎群众在他们离开了很久以后才散去。
    新华社金边24日电　周恩来总理一行今天早晨七时二十分，在西哈努克亲王陪同下，乘柬埔寨王国军用飞机前往磅湛省和暹粒省进行访问。
    当周总理和西哈努克亲王乘坐的汽车驶过这座美丽的京城的街道时，等候在路旁的成万的金边市民向他们热烈鼓掌欢呼。从周总理到达金边以来，这种热情洋溢的群众欢迎场面就没有间断过。
    在金边机场上送行的有：柬埔寨王国政府部长和其他高级官员；有一队皇家空军向贵宾们致敬。
    磅湛省政府和各界人民组织了盛大的欢迎来接待来宾。他们在出席了磅湛省长的午宴和参观橡胶园后，在下午乘飞机前往暹粒省继续进行访问。来宾们将在那里参观著名的吴哥古迹。
