    Underwater Vanguard
    Xinhua News Agency reporter Fang Di
    A diving team with more than forty members and new technical equipment has grown rapidly during the construction of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge.
    More than a year ago, most of the members of this team were young workers who had just been transferred from jobs such as rigging workers, riveters, and carpenters to learn diving techniques, except for a few people who had general diving skills; some were demobilized soldiers who had just left the army. These diving novices of a year ago have now become experts who can excellently complete their work tasks in water depths of up to thirty meters. They are respectfully called "Underwater Vanguard" by the bridge builders.
    It is not easy to wear diving equipment weighing 140 pounds to work underwater. As divers Zhou Changhe and Zhao Yongmei said: "In ten meters of water, you can still see a hazy white light, but when you get to a depth of twenty or thirty meters, your eyes lose their function, and everything can only rely on a pair of hands. People underwater also have to fight against rapids and waves. Perhaps just when you touch the object you are working on, a sudden wave will throw you far away, and you have to start groping again." They said, "Situations like this can often be encountered in ordinary rivers, and the situation is even more serious in the Yangtze River, where the waves are big and the currents are swift." Therefore, even those who have worked as divers in other rivers for many years find it difficult to deal with when they first come here, let alone novices who are just beginning to learn to dive.
    However, in order to make the Yangtze River Bridge serve socialist construction as soon as possible, the divers here did not bow to difficulties. They overcame many difficulties with extraordinary courage and collective wisdom, and learned skills in the struggle to overcome difficulties again and again. Take the new technology of underwater oxygen-arc cutting as an example! Initially, when Dai Quanhai, a diver who had just learned to dive, went to do this, he could not cut off the angle iron that needed to be cut. Even after using several welding rods, he could only leave some scattered small holes on the angle iron. It didn't work to have veteran divers do it either. People were so anxious that they brought experienced welders, but they still couldn't solve the problem. Later, after joint research and experimentation by divers Hu Linhai and others, they finally found the reason why the angle iron could not be cut: the water flow was too fast, so the arc could not be concentrated to burn one place. Based on this situation, they collectively researched a new tool that could fix the cutting welding rod in one place to burn and cut, solving the difficulties encountered in underwater oxygen-arc cutting.
    In the construction of the Yangtze River Bridge pier foundation project, which is about to be completed, divers have created brilliant achievements time and time again. This spring, because the Yangtze River peach blossom flood came early, it brought serious threats to the No. 2 pier, which was under intense construction. In order to ensure the construction of the No. 2 pier, the waterproof steel sheet pile cofferdam had to be raised. This required removing the original steel sheet piles and driving higher steel sheet piles. At that time, the original cofferdam had been submerged by the early flood. The divers went underwater to put on clamps, and then used cranes to lift the steel sheet piles one by one. Many steel sheet piles were lifted in this way, but some could not be lifted no matter what. There was no way, so the engineers had to decide to let the divers go to the bottom of the river to cut off the steel sheet piles.
    In spring, the water of the Yangtze River is still very cold, and it is during the flood season, and the situation of large waves and rapid currents is more prominent than usual. It is entirely conceivable how difficult it is to work under such circumstances. People still remember the difficult situation of cutting steel sheet piles that time: diver Xu Xianye went into the water several times, but did not come into contact with the object he was working on, because the flood was too rapid, and people were washed down several meters as soon as they entered the water. What to do? Later, Xu Xianye and Tan Yunbiao came up with a solution—diving into the cofferdam to cut, which avoided the impact of the water flow and created conditions for underwater cutting work. In this way, in completing all the work of removing the steel sheet pile cofferdam and driving the new cofferdam for No. 2 pier, eight divers worked day and night for more than twenty days.
    The No. 8 pier is about to be sealed. In order to wash away the sediment under the pier, diver Xu Xianye went to the bottom of the river twice, working for more than ten hours in total. He went underwater for the second time and worked for three hours, and the people above notified him by telephone to come up and rest. But he saw that the work was about to be completed, and it would take a lot of time to come up and change people, so he continued to work for more than an hour before coming up. This time, he completed the task excellently, but when he came up, he was so tired that he couldn't even open his eyes.
    Now, with the basic completion of the Yangtze River Bridge pier foundation project, diving work is no longer as tense and busy as it used to be. However, the divers here are not willing to let time pass in vain. In addition to undertaking daily work, they also organize amateur study and practice. When the reporter visited the construction site, a group of divers were taking turns going to the bottom of the river to practice new cutting techniques. Fu Bingkun, who had just come out of the water, told reporters: "In the future, many bridges and water conservancy projects will be built on the rivers of the motherland. If we don't learn more new technologies, we won't be able to keep up with the needs of national construction!"

    水下尖兵
    新华社记者　方堤
    一支拥有四十多个成员和新型技术装备的潜水员队伍，已经在武汉长江大桥的建设过程中迅速地成长起来。
    一年多以前，这支队伍的成员中除了少数几个人具有一般的潜水技术以外，大都是一些刚从装吊工、铆工和木工等工种调来学习潜水技术的青年工人；还有一些是刚刚离开部队的转业战士。就是这些一年前的潜水新手，现在已经变成能在深达三十公尺的水下出色地完成工作任务的能手了。他们被桥梁建设者们敬重地称为“水下尖兵”。
    穿戴着重达一百四十斤的潜水装备到水下面去工作是一件很不容易的事。正如潜水员周长贺和赵泳梅说的那样：“在十公尺深的水中，还能看到朦朦的白光，但到二、三十公尺的深处的时候，眼睛就失去作用了，一切只能依靠一双手，人在水下还要和激流、波浪作斗争。也许当你刚刚摸到工作物的时候，一个突然袭来的大浪会把你摔到老远的地方去，于是你不得不重新开始摸索。”他们说：“像这样的情况在通常的江河里都是常常可以碰到的，而在浪大流急的长江中情况就更为严重。”因此，连那些曾经在别的江河里作过多年潜水员的人，初到这里也感到难于对付，更不用说刚开始学习潜水的新手。
    可是，为了使长江大桥早日为社会主义建设服务，这里的潜水员们并没有向困难低头。他们用非凡的勇敢和集体的智慧战胜了重重困难，并且在一次又一次的战胜困难的斗争中学到了本领。就拿在水下进行氧电弧切割那样的新技术来说吧！最初，当刚学会潜水的潜水员戴全海去作这件事的时候，总不能把需要切割的角铁割断，用了好几根焊条也只能在角铁上留下一些星星点点的小洞。换老潜水员去干也不行，急得人们把有经验的电焊工都找来了还是不能解决问题。以后，经过潜水员胡林海等人共同研究和试验，终于找到了割不断角铁的原因：水的流速太大，使电弧不能集中地烧一个地方。根据这个情况，他们集体研究了一种能把切割焊条固定在一个地方烧割的新工具，解决了水下进行氧电弧切割所遇到的困难。
    在即将完成的长江大桥桥墩基础工程建设中，潜水员们曾经一次又一次地创造出光辉的成绩。今年春天，因为长江桃花汛来得早，给正在紧张施工的二号墩带来了严重的威胁。为了保证二号墩的施工，必须把防水的钢板桩围堰加高。这样就要拔除原来的钢板桩，插打更高的钢板桩。当时，原来的围堰已经被提早来到的洪水淹没了，潜水员们就到水下去上卡子，然后再用起重吊车把钢板桩一块一块地吊起来。不少钢板桩是用这个办法吊起来了，可是也有一些却无论如何也吊不动。没有办法，工程师们只好决定让潜水员到江底去把钢板桩割断。
    春天，长江的水还是很冷的，又是洪汛期间，浪大流急的情况比平时更加突出。完全可以想像，在这种情况下工作是多么艰巨。人们至今还记得那次切割钢板桩的困难情形：潜水员徐贤业好几次下到水里去，都没有接触到工作物，因为洪流太急，人刚进水就被冲下去好几公尺。怎么办呢？后来，徐贤业和谭云彪想出了一个办法——潜到围堰里面去切割，才避免了水流的冲击，为进行水下切割工作创造了条件。就这样，在完成二号墩拔除钢板桩围堰和插打新围堰的全部工作中，八个潜水员夜以继日地工作了二十多天。
    八号桥墩要封底了。为了洗刷墩下的泥沙，潜水员徐贤业曾经两次到江底去，一共工作了十小时以上。他第二次下水工作了三小时，上面就用电话通知他上来休息。但他看到工作很快就要完了，上来换人又得费不少时间，就继续坚持工作了一个多钟头才上来。这次，他出色地完成了任务，但当他上来以后，已经疲劳得连眼睛都睁不开了。
    现在，随着长江大桥桥墩基础工程的基本完成，潜水工作已经不像过去那样紧张繁忙了。但是，这里的潜水员们并不肯让光阴虚度。他们除了担负日常工作以外，还组织了业余的学习和实习。记者去工地访问的时候，有一批潜水员正在轮流到江底去实习新的切割技术。刚从水里上来的傅炳坤对记者说：“今后祖国的河流上将兴建许多桥梁和水利工程，不学会更多的新技术，就赶不上国家建设的需要！”
