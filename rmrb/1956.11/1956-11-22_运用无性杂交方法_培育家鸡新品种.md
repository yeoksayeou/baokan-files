Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, November 21st: Professor Zhang Jianshi of the Biology Department of Northwest University has achieved preliminary success in his experiment to cultivate new breeds of chickens using asexual hybridization methods.

Professor Zhang Jianshi, drawing on Soviet experience, selected three breeds of domestic chickens—White Leghorn, Australian Black, and Beijing Oil Chicken—for hybridization. The method is as follows: blood is drawn from a female chicken of one breed (the blood donor) and injected into a female chicken of another breed (the blood recipient). Then, the blood recipient is mated with a male chicken of its own breed. After more than a month of continuous blood transfusions, the eggs laid by the contemporary chickens showed significant changes in size and weight. Before the blood transfusions, the eggs laid by White Leghorn chickens weighed an average of 1.5 taels; after the transfusions, the eggs weighed an average of 1.73 taels. The first-generation hybrid chicks hatched not only had a survival rate of 100%, but were also much taller and stronger than purebred chickens. These hybrid chickens have strong vitality, develop relatively quickly, and have considerable resistance to diseases such as pullorum disease and diarrhea.

Professor Zhang Jianshi, leading several students from the Biology Department, completed the first generation of blood transfusion hybridization work last year. This year, they are continuing their experiments, preparing to conduct second-generation blood transfusion hybridization and anti-epidemic experiments. Zhang Jianshi believes that it may be possible to cultivate new breeds of domestic chickens with high egg production and strong disease resistance within the next two to three years.

    运用无性杂交方法
    培育家鸡新品种
    据新华社西安21日电　西北大学生物系教授张见石培育家鸡新品种的实验得到初步成绩。
    张见石教授参照苏联经验，选择白色莱亨鸡、澳洲黑鸡和北京油鸡三种家鸡进行杂交。方法是：抽出一个品种的雌鸡（给血者）的血液，注入另一个品种的雌鸡（受血者）体内，然后使受血者和它的同品种雄鸡交配。经过连续一个多月的输血，当代家鸡生的蛋，大小和重量上就发生显著变化。白色莱亨鸡在输血前生的蛋平均重一·五两，输血后生的蛋平均重一·七三两。孵化后的第一代杂种雏鸡，不仅成活率达到百分之百，而且比纯品种家鸡高大健壮得多。这些杂种鸡生活力强，发育比较迅速，对于白痢、腹泻等病有相当的抵抗力。
    张见石教授带领生物系几个学生，在去年做完了无性杂种第一代的输血杂交工作。今年，他们正在继续试验，准备进行第二代输血杂交以及抗疫试验等工作。张见石认为，在最近两、三年内有可能培育出产卵多抗病性强的家鸡新品种。
