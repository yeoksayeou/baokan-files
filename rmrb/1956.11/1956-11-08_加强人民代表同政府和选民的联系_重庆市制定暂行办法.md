The full text of these measures and rules is now published for reference by various localities.

Provisional Measures Regarding the Work of the National People's Congress Representatives' Offices, Strengthening the Supervision of the Municipal People's Congress Representatives over the Government's Work, and Further Strengthening the Ties Between the Municipal People's Representatives and Voters.

In order to further strengthen the ties between the government and the People's Representatives, strengthen the People's Representatives' supervision of the government's work, and strengthen the ties between the representatives and the voters (or original electoral units), so as to better implement policies and laws, improve government work, and overcome bureaucracy, these measures are hereby formulated:

I. According to the decision of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress on establishing National People's Congress Representatives' Offices, the Municipal People's Committee has established the Chongqing Representative Office of the National People's Congress (already established). The office shall have two to three cadres responsible for handling: 1. The organization and liaison work for the inspection work of the National People's Congress representatives; 2. Helping representatives solve difficulties encountered in performing their duties; 3. Monitoring the activities of the representatives; 4. Other matters that need to be handled.

II. Regarding strengthening the supervision of the Municipal People's Congress Representatives over the government's work:

1. The Mayor and Deputy Mayors shall receive representatives regularly each month. Because the number of Municipal People's Representatives is relatively large, they can be divided into several representative groups, with the Mayor or each Deputy Mayor responsible for receiving one to two groups, in order to conduct more extensive contact.

If the Mayor or Deputy Mayors are unable to receive representatives within the stipulated time due to special circumstances (such as being away on official business, sick leave, etc.), they may designate the Secretary-General, Deputy Secretary-General, or certain responsible staff members to receive them on their behalf.

2. The Municipal People's Committee shall, as needed, designate special personnel to visit representatives to solicit opinions.

3. The Municipal People's Committee may convene special symposiums of all or some representatives when necessary to listen to the representatives' criticisms and opinions.

4. The Municipal People's Committee shall regularly or irregularly organize representatives to inspect various tasks collectively or individually.

5. The various departments of the Municipal People's Committee shall seriously handle and respond to the requests and opinions raised by the representatives. When handling certain major issues, representatives may be invited to participate or assist when necessary, in order to strengthen the representatives' supervision of actual work and promote the development of work.

III. Regarding further strengthening the ties between the Municipal People's Representatives and the voters (or original electoral units):

1. People's Representatives shall maintain close contact with their original electoral units, accept the supervision of the original electoral units, and shall frequently participate in the People's Congresses of the districts and townships in their original elections or where they live, familiarize themselves with their work, and reflect their opinions and demands.

2. Representatives shall frequently pay attention to understanding the opinions and demands of the masses around them regarding the government's work, and shall convey and explain the government's various policies and resolutions to the masses.

3. When conditions permit, representatives shall directly meet or visit voters to strengthen ties with the people. The time and manner of the representatives meeting with voters shall be determined by the representatives themselves under the condition that it does not affect their own production and life and is as convenient as possible for the voters.

IV. The Municipal People's Committee shall issue necessary documents and materials for the reference of the representatives in their work and study. Representatives shall also frequently report their work situations and experiences to the People's Committee in order to understand the situation and exchange experiences.

V. These measures shall be implemented after being approved by the Municipal People's Committee.

Detailed Rules for the Municipal People's Committee to Connect with the Work of the Municipal People's Representatives

I. According to the provisions of the "Provisional Measures Regarding the Work of the National People's Congress Representatives' Offices, Strengthening the Supervision of the Municipal People's Congress Representatives over the Government's Work, and Further Strengthening the Ties Between the Municipal People's Representatives and Voters," these detailed rules for the Municipal People's Committee to connect with the work of the Municipal People's Representatives are hereby formulated.

II. Regarding the Mayor and Deputy Mayors receiving representatives: 1. The afternoon of the last Wednesday of each month is the reception time, and the reception location is in the General Office of the Municipal People's Committee. If representatives cannot meet with the Mayor or Deputy Mayors within the stipulated time due to work or other reasons, they can also report problems and opinions to the General Office at any time. 2. Representatives who come to meet with the Mayor or Deputy Mayors shall notify the General Office of the Municipal People's Committee two days in advance (by telephone or in writing) for arrangements. 3. The General Office shall sort out and forward the problems and opinions reflected by the representatives and regularly urge and inspect the relevant business departments to handle them. The handling situation of each department shall be sent to the General Office in writing within one month, and the General Office shall sort it out and report it to the Mayor and Deputy Mayors and reply to the People's Representatives in writing. 4. When the Mayor and Deputy Mayors receive representatives, the General Office may notify the responsible comrades of relevant offices and bureaus to participate according to the instructions of the Mayor and Deputy Mayors.

III. Regarding the division of representative groups: 1. Representative groups shall be divided according to the representative electoral districts and residential areas. Individual residents who are scattered may not be grouped. 2. Each representative group may elect one group leader. The group leader may convene meetings of the group's representatives as needed or according to the opinions of the group's representatives (such as studying major issues or exchanging experiences in representative work) or may solicit opinions individually. 3. The representatives of each representative group may collectively or send representatives to meet with the Mayor and Deputy Mayors, or they may meet with the Mayor and Deputy Mayors individually.

IV. Representatives' round-trip travel expenses to meet with the Mayor can be reimbursed by the public. Representatives living in the suburbs can also have their food and lodging solved by the public depending on the situation.
