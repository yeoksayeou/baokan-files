Where Did Friendship and Compassion Go?
Wang Kejun

Of the dozen or so comrades from the Xinhua Bookstore Beijing branch who were seriously injured in the bus accident on their outing, another six have passed away forever. This sad news couldn't help but bring back the tragic scene of the accident that day. It was a Sunday, October 14th, and the bus we were on for an outing to the Badaling area overturned near Sanbao Xia Liang on the Beijing-Zhangjiakou Highway. Many people lay on the ground covered in blood, and some of the less injured comrades were running around trying to call for help for those who were even more unfortunate.

Logically speaking, people, all truly humane people, should know how they should act and must act at that moment. Various images immediately appeared before people: some generously offered their cars and actively participated in the rescue; some ran around anxiously; some showed pity, sighed, and hesitated; and many selfish and cruel people continued on their way to Badaling. One car was stopped, and before we could clearly see who was inside, we only saw a woman in her forties, wearing a black woolen uniform, sitting next to the driver. After we explained our purpose to her, she maintained a frightening silence. Then the driver spoke up: "No, our car has broken down several times on the road!" The woman probably felt that it was her time to speak, and putting on a serious face, she spoke plausibly to vouch for the driver. I worried about whether her car could take her to Badaling and, after sightseeing, whether it could bring her back to Beijing! Some politely declined, using the excuse of having a seventy-year-old elder in the car; others emphasized that they had other special reasons and couldn't help; and still others were afraid of getting their cars dirty… Because the dying lying on the ground did not allow us to waste time, no one argued with them about right and wrong.

In this way, we did not get enough cars and had to transport more than a dozen seriously injured comrades in a large truck.

Friendship, compassion, mutual assistance, consideration… are inherent human qualities and the virtues of our nation for thousands of years. In many of our classical works, it is not difficult to find examples of this. Since liberation, the Communist Party has raised this virtue to a height never seen before in our history. But those who blindly pursue their own happiness have easily forgotten it. May these filthy things be dug out of their souls as soon as possible!

    友爱和同情那里去了
    王克峻
    新华书店北京分店郊游翻车身受重伤的十几个同志中，又有六个同志和我们永诀了。这个噩耗不禁使我又想起了当天翻车的那幅惨景。那是10月14日的一个星期天，我们到八达岭郊游的一辆汽车在京张公路三堡下梁附近翻车了，许多人血肉模糊地躺在地上，一些受伤较轻的同伴，在为那些遭到更大不幸的同伴奔走呼救。
    照理说，人，一切有人性的真正的人，都应该知道自己在那个时候应该怎样行动，必须怎样行动。各种形象的面孔，立即呈现在人们面前：有慷慨供献出自己的小汽车、积极抢救的，有焦急地跑来跑去的，有怜悯、嗟叹和徘徊的，也有许多自私、残忍的人，继续向八达岭进发的。有一辆汽车被截住了，来不及看清车里坐的都是什么人，只看见和司机并坐的是一个四十多岁、身着黑呢制服的女人。当我们和她讲清楚来意之后，她却保持着令人可怕的缄默。于是司机开了言：“不行，我们的车在路上已坏了几次了！”这位女人可能觉得自己说话的时机到了，先作出一本正经的面孔，振振有词地给司机作证。我很替她担心，她的汽车能不能把她带到八达岭，而且在逛游之后，还能不能把她带回北京！也有的借口车上有七十高龄的老人，婉词谢绝的，也有强调有别的特殊原由，爱莫能助的，更有人怕把自己车子弄脏的……。由于躺在地上的垂危的不允许我们浪费时间，也没有人去和他们论论是非。
    就这样，我们没有得到足够的小汽车，不得不把十几个伤势很重的同志用大卡车运走。
    友爱、同情、互助、体贴……，是人类固有的本性，是我国民族几千年来的美德。在我们许多古典作品中，都不难找到这方面的典范。解放几年来，共产党把这种美德提高到我国历史上从来没有过的高度。但是那些一味追求自己快乐的人们，却把它轻易地忘掉了。但愿这些肮脏的东西，早日从他们灵魂深处挖掉吧！
