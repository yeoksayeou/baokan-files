Xinhua News Agency, November 5th dispatch from Tel Aviv: An Israeli government spokesman said on November 4th that Israel would not agree to the entry of United Nations police forces into the Sinai Peninsula, which has been captured by Israel.

The spokesman said, "This truce organization of the United Nations is no longer needed in this region of Egypt."

While attempting to get people to recognize the fait accompli of its occupation of the Sinai Peninsula, the Israeli government issued a statement on the same day advocating so-called "direct negotiations" with Egypt to establish peace. The statement also said that Israel also agreed to hold similar negotiations with the governments of other Arab countries.

According to unconfirmed reports from Western news agencies, Syrian and Iraqi troops have entered Jordan. The Israeli government notified the United Nations General Assembly of this matter on the 4th.

Syria has common defense agreements with Jordan and Egypt against foreign aggression. Iraq also has an alliance treaty with Jordan.

    以色列想霸占西奈半岛
    不同意联合国部队开进
    新华社5日讯　特拉维夫消息：以色列政府发言人11月4日说，以色列将不同意联合国警察部队进入已被以色列攻占的西奈半岛。
    发言人说，“在埃及的这个地区已经不再用得着联合国的这个停战机构了。”
    以色列政府一方面企图叫人承认它侵占西奈半岛的既成事实，另一方面又在同一天发表声明主张同埃及举行所谓“直接谈判”以建立和平。声明又说，以色列也赞同和其他阿拉伯国家的政府举行类似的谈判。
    据未经证实的西方通讯社消息说，叙利亚和伊拉克的军队已经进入约旦。以色列政府在4日把这件事通知了联合国大会。
    叙利亚同约旦和埃及订有共同防御外国侵略的协定。伊拉克也同约旦订有同盟条约。
