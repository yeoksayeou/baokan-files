Fudan University History Department Discusses the Problem of Periodization of Ancient History

(According to Shanghai Wenhui Daily report) The History Department of Fudan University held a discussion on the periodization of slavery and feudalism in Chinese history on November 20. Participants included Chen Shoushi, Zhou Yutong, Chen Renbing, Hu Qiyuan, Zhu Bokang, Zhang Xun, and comrades from the Ministry of Higher Education and Shanghai People's Publishing House.

During the discussion, Chen Shoushi, Zhou Yutong, and others criticized some negative tendencies in the current academic discussions on the periodization of ancient history. Some scholars made inappropriate comparisons between world history and Chinese history, forcing some laws of world history and ancient Eastern history onto Chinese history. For example, some people believe that the Western Zhou Dynasty in China and ancient Egypt share three characteristics: rural communes, patriarchal systems, and enfeoffment systems. Ancient Egypt was a slave society, so the Western Zhou must also have been a slave society. Some blindly apply the conclusions of Soviet historians on the periodization of ancient Chinese history without concrete analysis and research. There are also many problems in the use of historical materials. For example, some people collect incomplete historical materials, using individual examples to prove the entire social form; some first establish subjective conclusions, and then look for materials that are favorable to their arguments, and if they cannot find the materials, they adopt methods that are not faithful to the historical materials such as "deleting key points"; still others use the method of "Shuowen Jiezi" ("Explaining and Analyzing Characters") and "disassembling characters" to prove the social form, so they have their own interpretations of "Guoren" ("National People") and "Zhongren" ("Common People"), but the problem is still difficult to solve.

Professor Chen Renbing and others believe that the key to future research lies in starting with the concrete study of socio-economic forms, and paying attention to examining the social relations of production and the productive forces as a whole. In the research, we should pay attention to the correct understanding and application of the viewpoint of historical materialism, as well as the good study of historical documents and materials, and also pay attention to the proportion of slaves and serfs in the same society. In addition, we cannot ignore the study of social legal systems. There were different views at the meeting on whether to continue to discuss the issue of periodization of ancient history in the future. Some people believe that the historical materials we currently have are limited, and the discussions have not grasped the essentials, so there is no need to continue the discussion, and we should wait for further research before discussing it. Others opposed this view, believing that we have already mastered extremely rich historical materials, even more than the European materials on feudal society, the problem is only how to correctly use the historical materials.

At the meeting, there were also different views on how to start studying the periodization of ancient history. Because the academic community is currently paying attention to the study of the socio-economic base, some people believe that the economic base problem is difficult to draw conclusions due to insufficient materials, so it may be better to start with the superstructure and then combine the base for discussion. Professor Zhou Yutong believes that many people in the current discussions have different understandings of the concepts of some phrases in the literature. It is best to use some effort to make an index of the relevant phrases "slave" and "feudal" in order to obtain some solid evidence.

### 复旦大学历史系讨论古史分期问题

    复旦大学历史系讨论古史分期问题
    据上海文汇报报道，复旦大学历史系在11月20日举行中国历史上奴隶制和封建制分期问题的讨论。参加的有陈守实、周予同、陈仁炳、胡曲园、朱伯康、章巽，以及高等教育部、上海人民出版社的同志。
    讨论中，陈守实、周予同等批判了目前学术界在古史分期讨论中的一些不好倾向。有的把世界史跟中国史作不妥当的对比；把世界史、古代东方史的一些规律强加于中国史之上。例如有人认为中国西周和古代埃及同样具有农村公社、宗法制、分封制三个特点，古代埃及是奴隶社会，因此西周一定也是奴隶制社会。有的盲目搬用苏联史学界对中国古代史分期的一些结论，不作具体的分析研究。在史料运用上也有很多问题。例如有些人搜集的史料不完备，以个别例子论证整个社会形态；有人先确立主观结论，再找对论点有利的材料，找不到材料就采用“删节点”等不忠实于史料的方法；更有人借助于“说文解字”“拆字”的办法，来论证社会形态，因此对“国人”“众人”各作各的解释，但问题还是难以解决。
    陈仁炳教授等认为今后继续研究的关键，在于从社会经济形态的具体研究着手，并且要注意把社会生产关系和生产力作为整体来考察。研究中既要注意对历史唯物主义观点的正确理解和运用，又要很好的研究历史文献资料，还要注意同一社会中奴隶和农奴的比重，此外不能忽视对社会法制的研究。对今后是否要继续讨论古史分期问题，会上也有不同的看法。有人认为现在掌握的史料有限，讨论中没有抓住要领，因此不需要继续讨论下去，等再进行一些研究后再讨论。也有人反对这种看法，认为目前我们已掌握有极丰富的史料，甚至比欧洲关于封建社会的史料还多，问题只是在于如何正确运用史料。
    会上，关于研究古代史分期如何入手的问题，也有不同的看法。由于目前史学界都注意研究社会经济基础，有人认为目前经济基础问题因为材料不足，难下结论，不妨先从上层建筑方面下手，再结合基础来讨论。周予同教授认为目前很多人在讨论中对文献中的一些辞句的概念有不同理解，最好用一些力量把有关“奴隶”“封建”的辞句作一个索引，以便获得一些实在的证据。
