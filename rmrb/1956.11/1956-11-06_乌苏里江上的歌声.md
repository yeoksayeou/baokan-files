Song on the Ussuri River

Warm dusk descends on the broad Ussuri River, which connects China and the Soviet Union. The river surface and the banks are silent. At this moment, a girl's singing of "Katyusha" drifts from the Chinese bank to the opposite shore. Soviet border guards all know, "This is our Cong Qiling (transliteration) singing..."

In the past, every evening, Soviet border guards would hear singing coming from the opposite bank. However, they didn't know who this female singer was, or what the Chinese lyrics they couldn't understand were saying. Suddenly, one evening, the singing stopped. The border guards felt an inexplicable emptiness.

On the fourth night, a small boat sped from the Chinese bank towards the Soviet side. Five minutes later, a Chinese doctor with gray hair, a wrinkled face, and glasses, emerged from the boat under the flashing light of a flashlight. He anxiously told the Soviet border guards in broken Russian that there was a girl named Cong Qiling in their town who was seriously ill and needed immediate surgery. However, their own hospital was too far away, and the patient couldn't withstand the bumpy car ride.

In a semi-conscious state, Cong Qiling vaguely remembered the riverbank near dawn, and how some people wearing green hats carried her onto a motorboat with a green flag, and later saw a female doctor in a snow-white coat and some unfamiliar faces bending over to look at her, faces full of sympathy. After that, she knew nothing.

An hour later, Soviet surgeon Kosyreva came to the hospital reception room. She said, "Please tell our friends on the opposite bank that everything went smoothly."

The girl quickly recovered her health. The day of her return home arrived, and although it was just across the river, Cong Qiling felt like she had to travel very far, very far... She held a large bouquet of flowers and sat on the boat back home, silently recalling: how many sleepless nights Doctor Kosyreva stayed by her bedside, how eagerly the Soviet border guards came to inquire about her condition and brought flowers. How could she thank them?

Cong Qiling found a way to thank her Soviet friends. She invited several female companions and taught them to sing Soviet songs. Every evening, they would come to the riverbank and sing "Katyusha" and "Moscow-Beijing." The singing, accompanied by friendship, lingered in the air above the river, reaching the opposite shore.

### 乌苏里江上的歌声

    乌苏里江上的歌声
    温暖的黄昏降临在连接中苏两国的宽阔的乌苏里江上。江面、岸边一片寂静。这时，一阵少女的歌声“喀秋莎”，从中国岸边飘向对岸。苏联边防军战士都知道，“这是我们的丛琪玲（译音）在歌唱……”
    从前，每逢傍晚，苏联边防军战士就听到对岸传来的歌声。但是，他们不知道，这个女歌手是谁？听不懂的中国歌词里都说些什么。突然有一天傍晚，歌声没有了。边防军战士感到一种莫名其妙的空虚。
    第四天夜里，有一只小船从中国岸边向苏联方面迅速驶去。五分钟后，一个头发斑白、满脸皱纹、带着眼镜的中国医生，在手电筒灯光闪烁下从船里出来。他用半通不通的俄语向苏联边防军战士焦急地说，他们镇上有一个叫丛琪玲的姑娘，病情严重，要马上动手术，可是自己的医院离得太远，病人又受不了途中汽车的颠簸。
    在昏睡状态中，丛琪玲隐约记得将近黎明的江岸，记得一些戴着绿帽子的人怎样把她抬上一个插着绿旗子的汽艇，以后看见一个穿着雪白衣服的女医生和一些弯腰看她的陌生的、但充满同情的面孔。再往下就不知道了。
    过了一小时，苏联外科医生科赛列娃来到了医院接待室。她说：“请转告我们对岸的朋友，一切顺利。”
    姑娘很快恢复了健康。回国的一天来临了，虽然过了江就到，可是丛琪玲觉得要走得很远、很远……她抱着一大束鲜花，坐在归国的船上，默默地回忆：有多少不眠之夜科赛列娃医生守在她的床前，苏联边防军战士怎样殷切地来打听她的状况，并且带来鲜花。怎么样感谢他们呢？
    丛琪玲找到了感谢苏联朋友的办法，她约了几个女伴，教会她们唱苏联歌曲。每到傍晚，她们就来到江边，唱“喀秋莎”，唱“莫斯科—北京”。歌声伴着友情，萦绕在江面上空，传到对岸。
