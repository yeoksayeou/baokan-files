Random Notes from the Overseas Chinese Hometown of Chao汕
Han Meng

Chao汕, a lovely hometown of overseas Chinese.

Chao汕 is a granary and an orchard. The overseas Chinese counties with many overseas Chinese families – Chaoan, Chenghai, and Chaoyang – have already leapt forward to become "Thousand-Jin Grain丰产 Counties"; Lin Yancheng, a model worker in Jieyang County, is known throughout the country for creating a national high-yield record for double-cropping rice. Sugar cane on the plains stretches as far as the eye can see, and tangerines on the mountains bloom and bear fruit every year. The overseas Chinese families living here have seen their incomes increase year by year. After agricultural cooperativization, they have completely turned over a new leaf and their lives have greatly improved. Overseas Chinese who have returned to the motherland are able to live and work in peace and actively participate in the socialist construction of the motherland.

What is recorded here are just a few of the many new things I have seen recently in the overseas Chinese hometown of Chao汕.

	Barren Hills Transformed into Orchards

After climbing a high mountain for half a day, we finally arrived at the Dananshan Overseas Chinese Collective Farm in Puning County.

Dananshan is a famous old revolutionary base in the Chao汕 area. Since the martyr Peng Pai sowed the seeds of revolution here, revolutionary bases have been established here in every revolutionary high tide for the past one or two decades. The residents of this mountain have been severely ravaged by the reactionaries. The villages on the mountain have been burned down several times. After the failure of the Great Revolution, many revolutionaries drifted from here to various parts of Southeast Asia to seek refuge.

In August 1954, in order to accommodate the displaced overseas Chinese who were expelled by foreign governments, the government specially chose to establish this farm on Dananshan.

The Dananshan Overseas Chinese Collective Farm now has two farms. The first farm was the first to be established. Initially, only seven people came. When they arrived on the mountain, they selected the ruins of Fenshui Village, which was burned down during the Great Revolution, as the site of the farm, built tile houses, reclaimed wasteland, planted fruits and raised pigs and cattle. In the second half of 1955, the second farm was established on the ruins of another village a few miles away from the first farm. They plan to open a third farm in 1957. Now, there are 100 overseas Chinese workers on the farm, with 16 families and 60 children. The farm has a nursery, a primary school, a night school, and a health clinic, all run by displaced and returned overseas Chinese. The farm also assigns farm members to specialize in growing vegetables and making tofu, trying to meet the farm members' requirements for housing and food. The average salary of farm members is 22 yuan. Wages are paid during work-related injuries and recuperation. If injured for non-work-related reasons, the public also subsidizes food costs during recuperation. Soon, the highway passing through here will be opened, and this will become a more joyful mountain village than it is now.

Li Jiayang, the deputy farm director who took me to visit, pointed to the orchard and said to me: "Two years ago, this was still a barren mountain. Now, more than 14,000 tangerine trees and 200,000 pineapple plants have been planted. In the future, we will focus on developing tangerine planting, planning to plant 1,200 mu. We will also appropriately develop other short-term harvest crops such as ramie and cassava. It is estimated that by 1957, we can harvest tangerines and pineapples worth 30,000 yuan. By 1959, it can be industrialized. Our tangerines here will still bear fruit even at the age of eighty or ninety. Think about how far-reaching our future is!"

I visited several displaced and returned overseas Chinese from Thailand, Malaya, Vietnam, and Indonesia; some are in their sixties, and some are in their twenties. They can all see the great future of the farm, especially those displaced overseas Chinese who have suffered greatly in Thailand and Malaya. They are all determined to settle down here. He Mucheng, an elderly displaced overseas Chinese in his late fifties, said: "The government originally wanted to send me to a nursing home, but I didn't go. Look, I still have a lot of strength! When I was a teenager, I drifted to Thailand to make a living because my family was poor. I have been in Thailand for more than forty years. I have been a coolie (worker) and a headman (boss). I have tasted all kinds of hardships. When I got old, I couldn't afford to pay the 400 baht identification fee, so I was arrested and imprisoned several times, and finally deported. When I returned to the motherland, I quit opium and my body became stronger. How could I be embarrassed to go to a nursing home to enjoy myself for nothing? No, no, we must build Dananshan into a large orchard..."

Yes, this farm is a banner for developing the rich Dananshan!

	The Birth of "Jingxing Building"

"Jingxing Building" is the name of a new building in Nigou Township, Puning County. Its owner, Zhang Jingcai, is an overseas Chinese businessman who runs a small restaurant in Wanfosui, Thailand. He has been working in Thailand for exactly thirty years. In the past thirty years, he has not made much money, but he has had a lot of children, which makes his wife worry day and night. Originally, the only house in his hometown was only enough to hold a bed, a table for eight immortals, a few chairs and build a stove. The house was short and dark, and in the summer it became a big steamer. One day, the whole family returned to the country, "leaves fall back to their roots", but where to live! Therefore, for more than ten years, their whole family has had an ideal: to build a large house that is enough for the whole family to live in.

In recent years, Zhang Jingcai's business has developed; after the liberation of his hometown, prices have stabilized, and their ambition to build a house has become more and more enthusiastic. By last year, even the address had been tentatively determined. Zhang Jingcai originally had a small piece of ancestral land outside the village, near the mountain and靠 the water pond, which was not suitable for building a house. However, when they thought of the fact that before liberation, overseas Chinese who returned to their hometown to build a house had to look for a good house site, and the price was so high that people dared not even think about it; sometimes, even if they bought it at a high price, because someone wanted to extort money from the front, back, left, and right of the house site, they would obstruct it in many ways. As a result, even if they had money, they could not build it, so they had to be content with their situation.

At this time, the high tide of agricultural cooperativization came, and Zhang Jingcai's family joined the advanced cooperative. Zhang Minghan, the director of the cooperative, knew that his family was planning to build a house, and was very happy, so he took the initiative to come to them and tell them that the house site outside the village was near the water pond, and it would be very noisy to build a hydroelectric station in the future; it would be better to find another location to build a house. He also said: "Now, more than 1,000 farmers in our township have joined the advanced cooperative, and the land is all public. Overseas Chinese who want to build a house can choose any location, and the cooperative will definitely help solve it." Township head Zhang Ruiguang and others also knew about this and came to help choose a location. Finally, the current good house site was selected. This house site is more than eight points wide, and the land price is only more than 4,000 yuan. The procedures for buying the land are also very simple.

After buying the house site, Zhang Jingcai remitted money from Thailand to build the house, and proposed to build a "Four Point Gold" style (two halls and six rooms). His daughter, a junior high school graduate, believed that the "Four Point Gold" style house was expensive and impractical. From the perspective of his family having many people and mostly overseas Chinese children, if a building could be built, there would be more houses and it would be more to the taste of overseas Chinese youth. So, she wrote letters to persuade her father, and asked the county construction trade union to build it. As a result, it was designed into the current "Tile Double Tiger Stacked Building" style building (two halls and ten rooms). The county overseas Chinese affairs section knew about this and quickly asked the county people's committee to approve the allocation of more than 100 bags of cement needed to build the building, giving strong support. The director of the construction trade union personally led the workers to build the building, constantly studying the problems of saving materials and improving quality. In this way, with the joint help of workers and farmers, in just three months, and spending only 16,000 yuan, a magnificent "Jingxing Building" was completed.

The owner of "Jingxing Building" led me to the building and proudly said to me: "If it weren't for liberation, and if it weren't for joining the advanced cooperative, how could we have built such a house, and how could we have built it so smoothly?"

	The Origin of "Qunqiao Pavilion"

In the fields of Lingtou Village, Caitang Township, Chaoan County, not long ago, three new rain pavilions appeared - Qunqiao One Pavilion, Qunqiao Two Pavilion, and Qunqiao Three Pavilion. On the pavilion gates, there is a red couplet: "Walk the road of collectivization with a radiant light, Wish Chairman Mao boundless longevity."

The content of this couplet truly expresses the feelings of the overseas Chinese who built these rain pavilions. It turned out that Xie Baosheng, a returned overseas Chinese from Singapore in Lingtou Village, has always been very concerned about the cultural undertakings of his hometown. A year before liberation, he returned from Singapore and planned to build a primary school in his hometown with some fellow villagers. However, at that time, prices were rising three times a day, and safety was not guaranteed, so he had to leave in disappointment. Not long after liberation, Xie Baosheng returned to his hometown with this wish again. This time, their ideals were realized. The people's government supported them in building several school buildings, and the primary school was established. This matter gave Xie Baosheng a great education. He settled down and led the overseas Chinese families to organize a mutual aid group, made achievements, was rewarded, and was also elected as a representative of the township people.

During the general election, the farmers in the township successively made requests, asking the government to build three rain pavilions in the fields for farmers to shelter from the rain and the sun, and also for farmers passing by to rest. Seeing that the government was not able to meet the farmers' requirements for the time being, Xie Baosheng took the initiative to propose to the township's party and government: he would mobilize fellow overseas Chinese in Singapore to donate money to build them. After this proposal was accepted, he wrote letters to some fellow villagers and workers in Singapore to solicit donations. Soon, several hundred dollars were donated and remitted back. Xie Baosheng himself added several hundred yuan. With the support and help of his farmer brothers, these three new rain pavilions built with donations from overseas Chinese were completed.

This is the origin of "Qunqiao Pavilion", and this kind of public welfare undertaking enthusiastically built by overseas Chinese can be seen everywhere in the overseas Chinese hometown of Chao汕.

    潮汕侨乡散记
    韩萌
    潮汕，可爱的华侨故乡。
    潮汕，是一个粮仓，是一座果园。侨眷众聚的侨县——潮安、澄海、潮阳已经一跃而成为“粮食丰产千斤县”；揭阳县的劳动模范林炎城，因创造了全国双季水稻高产纪录而闻名全国。平原上的甘蔗，一望无际，山上的蜜柑，年年开花结实。生活在这里的侨眷，收入年年增加，农业合作化以后，他们彻底翻了身，生活大大改善了。华侨回到了祖国，都能够安居乐业，积极地参加祖国的社会主义建设。
    这里所记述的，只不过是我最近到潮汕侨乡所见到的许多新鲜事物中的几件。
        荒山变成果园
    爬了半天高山，我们才到了普宁县大南山华侨集体农牧场。
    大南山是潮汕地区著名的老革命根据地。自从彭湃烈士在这里撒过革命种子以后，一、二十年来，无论哪个革命高潮时期，这里都建立过革命根据地。这山上的居民，受反动派摧残甚烈。山上的乡村，曾几度被烧光。大革命失败后，还有不少革命者从这里飘流到南洋各地去避难。
    1954年8月，政府为了收容被外国政府驱逐出境的难侨，特地选择在大南山上建立了这个农牧场。
    大南山华侨集体农牧场现在有两个场。第一场是最早建立的。起初只来了七个人。他们到了山上，选定了在大革命时代被烧毁了的分水村的废墟作为场址，筑起瓦房，开垦荒山，种植水果和牧养猪牛。1955年下半年，才在离第一场几里远的另一个村的废墟上，建立了第二场。他们计划在1957年还要增辟第三场。现在，场里有华侨职工一百人，有家眷十六户，小孩六十个。场里设有托儿所、小学、夜校、保健室，都由难侨和归侨主持。场里还分配场员专种蔬菜、专制豆腐，尽量满足场员对住、食的要求。场员的工资，平均是二十二元，因公受伤、休养时照发工资，非因公受伤的，休养时也由公家贴发伙食费。不久以后，那条通过这里的公路修通了，这里将会变成一个比现在更加欢乐的山村的。
    带我去参观的李甲阳副场长，指着果园对我说：“两年前，这里还是一片荒山，现在，已种下蜜柑一万四千多株、菠萝二十万株。今后，要重点发展种柑，计划种一千二百亩。其他的短期收成的苎麻、木薯也要适当发展。估计到1957年，可收价值三万元的柑和菠萝。到1959年就可企业化了。我们这里的柑，活到八、九十年还会结实的，你想想，我们的前途多远大哪！”
    我访问了几位难侨和归侨，他们来自泰国、马来亚、越南和印度尼西亚等地；有六十多岁的，也有一、二十岁的。他们大都能看到农牧场的远大前途，尤其是那些在泰国和马来亚受尽摧残的难侨，他们都决心把家安在这里了。年近六十的老难侨何木成说：“政府原来要送我去养老院，我不去。你看，我还有不小的气力呀！我十多岁时，因为家贫，飘流到泰国去谋生。在泰国四十多年，我当过苦力（工人），也当过头家（老板），甜咸苦涩都尝过。年老了，缴不起四百铢的随身证，就被抓去关了几次，最后还被驱逐出境。回到祖国，鸦片戒了，身体变健壮了，难道好意思去养老院白享福，不，不，我们要把大南山建设成一座大果园哩……”
    是的，这农牧场正是开发富饶的大南山的一面旗帜！
        “景星楼”的诞生
    “景星楼”是普宁县泥沟乡一座新楼房的名称。它的主人张景才，是在泰国万佛岁埠经营小饭店的华侨商人。他去泰国谋生已整整三十年。三十年来，钱赚不多，却生下成打的儿女，这事情使他的妻子日夜忧愁。原来他家乡所有的那一间房子，只够放置一张眠床、一张八仙桌、几条椅子和筑一个炉灶。房子既矮又黑，夏天更变成个大蒸笼。有一天，“叶落归根”，全家回国，住到哪里去呢！因此，他们全家人，十多年来都有一个理想：建造一座足够全家安居的大房子。
    这几年，张景才的生意有了发展；家乡解放后，物价又稳定下来，他们要建屋的雄心愈来愈热了。到了去年，连地址也初步确定了。张景才原有一小块祖遗的田，在村外，近山、靠水陂，本来是不适合建屋的。但是，他们一想起解放以前，华侨回乡建屋要物色一块好屋地，价钱高昂得令人想都不敢想；有时高价买来，却因为屋地的前后左右有人想敲竹杠，多方阻难，结果有钱也建不成，他们也就只好安分守己了。
    正在这时候，农业合作化高潮到来了，张景才他家加入了高级社。社主任张明汉知道了他家打算建屋，很是高兴，便主动地来找他们，告诉他们，村外他家那块屋地邻近水陂，将来要建水电站，一定很吵闹；要建屋不如找其他地点。还说：“现在，我们全乡一千多户农民都加入了高级社，田地都公有了，华侨要建屋，可以随意选择地点，社一定会帮忙解决的。”乡长张瑞光等知道这事，也来帮助选择地点，最后，才选定了现在这块好屋地。这屋地八分多阔，地价只四千多元，买地的手续也非常简便。
    买定了屋地，张景才就从泰国汇款回来建造，而且提出要建造“四点金”式的（二厅六房）。他的女儿是个初中毕业生，认为“四点金”式的屋，花钱多，又不实用；从他家人口多、而且多是华侨子弟这个特点看，如果能建成楼房，房子又多、也会更合华侨青年的口胃。于是，她一面写信劝说父亲，一面请县建筑工会来建造。结果，就设计成了现在的“瓦双虎叠楼”式的楼房（二厅十房）。县侨务科知道了这件事，忙转请县人民委员会批准调拨建楼房所需的一百多包水泥，大力支持。建筑工会主任亲自带领工人来建造，不断研究节约材料、提高质量的问题。这样，在工人和农民共同帮助下，只经过三个月，只花一万六千元，一座堂皇的“景星楼”就落成了。
    “景星楼”的主人引我登楼，自豪地对我说：“如果不是解放，又不是加入了高级社，我们要想建这样的房子，要想建得这样顺利，可能吗？”
      “群侨亭”的来历
    在潮安彩塘乡坽头村的田野上，不久以前，出现了三个新雨亭——群侨一亭、群侨二亭、群侨三亭。在亭门上，写着一付红对联：“走合作化光芒万丈，祝毛主席福寿无疆”。
    这一付对联的内容，确实道出了这群建造雨亭的华侨的心里话。原来是，坽头村有个新加坡归侨谢宝升，向来对家乡的文化事业很是关心。解放前一年，他从新加坡回来，就和一些同乡打算在家乡兴建一所小学校，可是，那时候，物价一日三涨，安全又没保障，他只好扫兴而去。解放后不久，谢宝升又怀着这个想望回到家乡，这一次，他们的理想实现了，人民政府支持他们建起了几座校舍，小学校办起来了。这事情给谢宝升很大的教育，他安心住了下来，带动侨眷，组织了一个互助组，干出了成绩，受到奖励，自己也当选了乡人民代表。
    在普选的时候，乡里的农民纷纷提出要求，要求政府能在田野中建三个雨亭，给农民避雨、避太阳，也可给过路的农民歇息。谢宝升看到政府一时还没能力来满足农民这个要求，他便主动地向乡的党、政提出建议：由他去发动新加坡的同乡华侨乐捐建造。这建议被接纳后，他就写信向远在新加坡的一些同乡商人和职工进行募捐，不久，果然乐捐了几百块钱汇回来了，谢宝升自己再添捐上几百元，在农民兄弟的支持、帮助下，这三个由华侨捐款兴建的新雨亭就建成了。
    这就是“群侨亭”的来历，而这种由华侨热心兴建的公益事业，在潮汕侨乡，是到处都可以见到的。
