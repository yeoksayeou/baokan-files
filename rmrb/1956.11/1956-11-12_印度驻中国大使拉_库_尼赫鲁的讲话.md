Mr. Chairman, friends:
    On this memorable day of the ninetieth anniversary of the birth of Sun Yat-sen, the great son of the Chinese revolution, I feel very honored to represent the Indian government and people in extending warm congratulations to the Chinese government and people, and to give full support to this historically significant celebration.
    The event we are celebrating today draws our close attention to an extremely important chapter in world history. Therefore, it is not only of great significance to China, but also of great significance to the whole world, especially to the people of Asian and African countries.
    Sun Yat-sen was a great son of China, but in our view, he was also a great son of Asia. The struggle he devoted his life to was not just China's struggle. It was part of a broader struggle involving many countries in Asia and Africa.
    This struggle has many aspects. In the political aspect, the goal of this struggle was to oppose foreign rule and control, because this period was a period of imperialist expansion and the subjugation of many great Asian countries. China was no exception. India and China had the same experience.
    Three years after Sun Yat-sen was born, Gandhi was born in India; around the same time, the struggles for liberation in the two countries reached maturity one after the other. These two countries are neighbors with a long history of friendship, but foreign forces separated them. The struggle for liberation made us recall the past, and the Indian people watched the struggle of the Chinese people under the leadership of Sun Yat-sen with deep concern and sympathy.
    This struggle was not limited to the political sphere. Sun Yat-sen's great contribution lies in his emphasis on social reform, on eliminating exploitation, and on eliminating other weaknesses that undermine the social structure. He made the struggle for liberation a people's struggle, gave it a democratic foundation, and combined it with the demand for social reform and social liberation.
    In India, under the leadership of Gandhi, there was a similar development. The Indian political movement against foreign rule also expanded into a movement to reform the social structure. The common goal of the people of the two countries made them sympathetic to each other, willing to learn from each other, and especially to respect those who participated in these struggles. We respect Sun Yat-sen because of his ideals and his qualities. Fortunately, there are still many people among us who were his contemporaries, and in this regard, they can provide some real information. What I can say is that what deeply moved us Indians was his indomitable courage and boundless energy, his patience and perseverance, and his loyalty to the interests of the people, all of which made Sun Yat-sen occupy a lofty position among Asian leaders.
    We can learn a lot from these historically significant struggles and from the qualities of leaders like Sun Yat-sen.
    Some nations in Asia and Africa still face attempts at foreign control, while others face racial oppression and other forms of oppression; some nations have achieved independence and liberation and are carrying out the arduous task of building their countries.
    The people of Asia and Africa need further unity. We need to make greater efforts to eliminate our backwardness and other weaknesses that weaken us. What is especially important is that, whether in the struggle against foreign rule and control or in the struggle for national construction, we need the courage and perseverance, the high degree of dedication, and other great qualities possessed by people like Sun Yat-sen.

### 印度驻中国大使拉·库·尼赫鲁的讲话

    印度驻中国大使
   拉·库·尼赫鲁的讲话主席，朋友们：
    在中国伟大的革命的儿子孙中山诞辰九十周年这个值得纪念的日子，我感到很荣幸能代表印度政府和人民向中国政府和人民致以热烈的祝贺，并对这一具有历史意义的庆祝给以全力支持。
    今天我们所庆祝的事件，使我们密切注意到世界历史上极其重要的一章。因此，它不仅对于中国具有很重大的意义，而且对于整个世界具有重要意义，特别是对于亚非各国人民具有重大意义。
    孙中山是中国伟大的儿子，但据我们看来，他也是亚洲伟大的儿子。他以毕生精力所从事的斗争并不仅仅是中国的斗争。它是范围更加广大的，包括亚、非两洲许多国家的斗争的一部分。
    这一斗争有很多方面，在政治方面，这一斗争的目标是反对外国的统治和控制，因为这一时期是帝国主义扩张和亚洲许多伟大的国家沦为附属国的时期。中国也不例外。印度和中国也有同样的遭遇。
    孙中山诞生三年之后，甘地在印度诞生了；约在同一时期，两国争取解放的斗争先后达到了成熟阶段，这两个国家是紧邻，具有悠久的友好的历史，但是，外来的力量把它们拆散了。争取解放的斗争使我们重新回忆到过去，印度人民以深切的关怀和同情注视着孙中山领导下的中国人民的斗争。
    这一斗争不仅限于政治方面。孙中山的巨大贡献在于他着重社会改革，着重于消灭剥削和消除破坏社会结构的其他弱点。他使争取解放的斗争成为人民的斗争，使这一斗争具有民主的基础，并把这一斗争与争取社会改革和社会解放的要求结合起来。
    在印度，在甘地的领导下也有类似的发展，印度反对外国统治的政治运动也扩大为争取改革社会结构的运动。两国人民的共同目标使他们彼此同情，使他们愿意互相学习，特别是使他们彼此尊敬参加这些斗争的人们。孙中山所以令我们尊敬是因为他的理想和他的品质。幸运的是，在我们中间还有很多和他同时的人，在这方面，他们可以提供一些真实的情况。我所能说的是，使我们印度人深受感动的是他的坚强不屈的勇气和无穷的精力，他的耐心和毅力，以及他对人民利益的忠诚，这一切使孙中山在亚洲领袖中占有崇高的地位。
    从这些具有历史意义的斗争中，以及从像孙中山这样的领袖们的品质中，我们可以取得很多教益。
    亚洲和非洲有些民族仍然面临着外国的统制的企图，而另一些民族则面临着种族压迫和其他形式的压迫；有些民族已经取得了独立和解放，正在进行艰巨的工作来建设他们的国家。
    亚非各国人民需要进一步团结。我们需要作更大的努力来消除我们的落后状态以及其他使我们衰弱的缺点。尤其重要的是，不论是在反对外国统治和控制的斗争中，还是在进行国家建设的斗争中，我们都需要像孙中山这样的人所具有的勇气和毅力，高度的专心致志的精神，以及其他伟大品质。
