    Open Political Dealings
    British Acting Prime Minister Butler and some Conservative Party members have recently given speeches admitting that their refusal to withdraw troops from Egypt was to seize the Suez Canal. United Press International, in reporting these speeches, summarized: "Eden, staking his government, insisted on this attitude: Egypt must not be allowed to operate the canal without some form of international supervision or control." However, the gamblers also realized that their capital was about to be lost. In the words of UPI: "The fact that the canal is blocked has dealt a serious blow to the British economy. … The United Nations' demand this week that Britain immediately withdraw from the canal area has created a temporary danger of the British government collapsing."
    What to do? They are now pinning all their hopes on the United States, openly demanding a political deal with the United States. Conservative MP Angus Maude bluntly stated that in the past at the United Nations, the United States had been "accepting British help"; now, it was the United States' turn to "repay" and "help" Britain. Butler also shouted, demanding that the United States give Britain "full support" so as to "live up to" Britain's trust in the United States. The implication is clear that if the United States continues to play dumb, he will expose all of America's dirty secrets. Therefore, UPI believes that he "seems to be putting full pressure on the United States."
    It is rare even among imperialists for the British Conservative government to so recklessly bring such unspeakable behind-the-scenes bargaining to the table. This rather demonstrates the mentality of a gambler betting everything when his capital is about to be lost.

    公开的政治买卖
    英国代理首相巴特勒和一些保守党议员，最近连着发表演说，承认了他们不肯从埃及撤兵是为了要夺取苏伊士运河。合众社在报道这些演说的时候总结说：“艾登以他政府为赌注，坚持这种态度：一定不允许埃及在没有某种形式的国际监督或控制的情况下经营运河。”但是，赌徒们也发觉，他们的赌本快要输光了。用合众社的话来说：“运河被堵塞这个事实，使得英国经济遭受了一次严重打击。……联合国在这星期向英国提出立即撤出运河地区的要求，一时有使得英国政府垮台的危险。”
    怎么办呢？他们现在把全部希望寄托在美国身上，公开地要求同美国做一场政治买卖。保守党议员安格斯·莫德毫不掩饰地说：过去在联合国，美国一直是“接受英国的帮助”的；现在，该轮到美国“酬答”和“帮助”英国了。巴特勒也大声叫喊，要求美国给英国的“充分支持”以“不辜负”英国对美国的信任。言下之意显然是，如果美国再要装蒜，他就要把美国的老底子都掀出来了。因此，合众社认为，他“好像是对美国施加充分的压力。”
    像英国保守党政府这样不顾一切地把不可告人的幕后讨价还价公开地端到桌面上来，在帝国主义之间也是很少见的。这颇能说明冒险孤注的赌徒在老本快要输光时候的心情。
