Xinhua News Agency, Zhaojue, 21st. The Central Delegation held a慰问大会 in Zhaojue on the 20th. People came from various organizations and from mountainous areas dozens of miles away, forming an unprecedented gathering of more than 15,000 people in the Liangshan area.

Wang Yifu recalled the contributions of the Yi people and some far-sighted upper-class people to the Chinese revolution in the past, especially their sympathy and assistance to the Red Army, and congratulated the people of Liangshan Yi region on the political, economic, and cultural development after liberation. He, on behalf of the Central People's Government and Chairman Mao, expressed condolences to the farmers, officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, and cadres of various ethnic groups, Yi and Han, who have contributed to the construction of Liangshan, and extended greetings to the upper-class people.

He encouraged the people of all ethnic groups in Liangshan to further strengthen unity and successfully complete the democratic reform.

The person in charge of the Second Sub-Delegation presented silk banners to the leading organs of the Autonomous Prefecture. These banners were embroidered with Chairman Mao's inscription: "People of all nationalities of the People's Republic of China, unite!" and the same in the Yi language.

    接着，慰问团赠送了给自治州的礼品。根据礼品单，其中包括有二千七百多万斤粮食、十五万套寒衣、十二万枚纪念章和大批图书、文娱用品。
