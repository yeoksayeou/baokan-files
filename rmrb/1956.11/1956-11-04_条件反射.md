    Conditioned Reflex

    At the United Nations General Assembly meeting on November 1st to discuss the issue of armed aggression against Egypt by Britain, France, and Israel, Dulles had another small episode. After he walked to the podium with a stack of documents, he opened his mouth and described the recent U.S. proposal in the Security Council, which was vetoed by Britain and France, demanding that Israel stop attacking Egypt, as having been vetoed by "the Soviet Union, Britain, and France." This caused a burst of laughter at the time, so much so that he had to apologize for this "slip of the tongue."

    Mr. Dulles is not a novice on the podium, so this kind of "slip of the tongue" is very thought-provoking. Dulles has spoken at the United Nations countless times, and almost every time he is inseparable from anti-Soviet and anti-communist rhetoric. This has probably also formed a kind of conditioned reflex, so that as soon as he touches the podium, anti-Soviet clichés blurt out involuntarily.

    To be fair, Dulles this time did not openly echo the ridiculous claim of the British and French representatives to attribute their aggression to the Soviet Union; however, people also noticed that when Dulles, on behalf of the United States, called for an immediate ceasefire between the warring parties, he did not say a single word condemning the British and French aggression, but only blamed them for using force when "peaceful methods had not been exhausted," and declared that Britain and France were "our old allies and the most trusted and reliable allies." At the same time, he also said that "Egypt violated the 1888 treaty" and accused Egypt of "vigorously rearming." These words are obviously not a good sign!

    条件反射
    在11月1日联合国大会讨论英、法和以色列武装侵略埃及问题的会议上，杜勒斯又闹了一个小插曲。他夹着一扎文件走上讲台之后，一开口就把最近在安全理事会被英、法两国否决了的要求以色列停止进攻埃及的美国提案，说成是“被苏联、英国和法国”否决了的。当时引起了哄堂大笑，以致他不得不为这次“失言”而道歉。
    杜勒斯先生不是初上讲台的生手，这种“失言”是很耐人寻味的。杜勒斯在联合国不知发过多少次言了，几乎每一次都离不了反苏反共。这大概也形成一种条件反射了，只要他一触到讲台，反苏滥调就不由脱口而出。
    应当说公道话，杜勒斯这一次的确没有公开地附和英、法代表的那种企图把它们的侵略行动归咎于苏联的可笑的说法；但是，人们也注意到，杜勒斯在代表美国提出要求敌对双方立即停火的时候，却没有半个字谴责英、法的侵略行动，而只是责怪它们在“和平方法还没有用尽”的时候就使用武力，并且声明英法是“我们的老盟友和最信任、最可靠的盟友”。同时，他还说什么“埃及违反了1888年条约”，指责埃及“大力地重整军备”。这些话显然不是什么好兆头！
