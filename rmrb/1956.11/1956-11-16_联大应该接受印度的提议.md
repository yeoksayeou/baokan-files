　　India's representative to the United Nations, Lall, submitted a memorandum to the UN Secretary-General on the 12th, formally proposing that the issue of China's representation in the United Nations be included in the agenda of the current UN General Assembly. This proposal conforms to the universal desire of the member states of the United Nations and the people of all countries. Now, not only socialist countries and most other countries that recognize our country, but also an increasing number of countries that have not yet established diplomatic relations with our country, believe that the People's Republic of China, with a population of 600 million, is still excluded from the United Nations, which seriously damages the prestige and role of the United Nations and must be corrected immediately. The Chinese people welcome and support India's proposal. In order to uphold the dignity of the UN Charter, the current UN General Assembly should accept India's proposal and immediately restore the legitimate rights and status of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations.

　　For seven years, the great People's Republic of China has been developing more and more strongly. It has unswervingly pursued a peaceful foreign policy, respected the UN Charter, and actually implemented the Charter's lofty tasks of maintaining peace and promoting international cooperation. Therefore, its international prestige and the role it plays in international affairs are growing. This fact is unanimously recognized by more and more countries and broad public opinion around the world. India also pointed out these undeniable facts in the memorandum. As the Indian memorandum pointed out, only the government of the People's Republic of China is the sole government that can represent China in the United Nations, and only it has the ability and is prepared to fulfill the obligations of a member state under the Charter on behalf of the Chinese people. Therefore, depriving the Chinese government of its representation not only contradicts the UN Charter and the UN's practice of treating member states, but also contradicts the interests of the UN, the cause of promoting world peace, and international cooperation.

　　As everyone knows, the completely intolerable and abnormal situation that has caused the long-term deprivation of the People's Republic of China's representation in the United Nations is the result of the United States imposing a policy of hostility towards the Chinese people, hostility towards peace, and international cooperation on the "majority" of UN member states. Although this US policy is not in line with the interests of the UN and its member states, and has aroused increasing dissatisfaction and opposition from more and more countries, the US government still uses various overbearing means year after year to force the UN General Assembly to "postpone consideration." Nolan, the head of the notorious US so-called "China lobby," had to admit in April this year when he was clamoring against the restoration of our country's legitimate rights in the United Nations that the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, neutral countries, and "some of our allies" all "strongly" advocated that our country should obtain a seat in the United Nations. Another US Ambassador to Canada, Merchant, who is hostile to the Chinese people, also admitted that the lack of sympathy and understanding for the US's Far East policy "is mainly related to our policy towards Communist China," and people call this policy "rigid" and "shortsighted." However, the US reactionary group still uses all means to put pressure on its partners in an attempt to continue to deprive our country of its representation in the United Nations. They pay lip service to respecting the UN Charter and the right of the people of all countries to choose their own governments, but in reality, they are carrying out the most unrestrained and shameless trampling on this sacred right of the Charter and the people of all countries. The United States stubbornly continues to implement this unrealistic policy, which is inseparable from its insidious plan to create distrust and hostility in the Far East and around the world, and to maintain and intensify tensions.

　　Currently, the United States is continuing to force the "majority" of member states in the Eleventh UN General Assembly to "postpone consideration" of the urgent issue of our country's representation. On the 14th, at a meeting of the General Committee of the UN General Assembly, the US representative, in collusion with Britain and other countries, passed the US proposal, which actually wanted the General Assembly to disregard India's legitimate proposal to include the issue of China's representation on the agenda of the General Assembly and refused to consider this issue at the current General Assembly. We cannot but lodge a serious protest against this decision passed by the US-manipulated General Committee, which blatantly violates the UN Charter and the universal desire of member states. We cannot but express our utmost indignation that the representative of Britain, which has already recognized our country, continues to follow the United States and adopts an extremely unfriendly policy towards the Chinese people.

　　However, the United States' arbitrary act of depriving our country of its representation in the United Nations could not, and will never, harm China in the past, but can only harm the prestige and role of the United Nations, and harm the United States and the countries that echo the United States' policy of hostility towards the Chinese people. This has been proven by the facts of the past seven years. The current UN General Assembly bears the urgent task of stopping the aggression against Egypt and easing international tensions. All peace-loving countries that are willing to uphold the UN Charter must defeat the US conspiracy to obstruct the current UN General Assembly from completing this sacred task, and must never allow the US policy of hostility towards the Chinese people to succeed in the United Nations again.

### 联大应该接受印度的提议

    联大应该接受印度的提议
    印度驻联合国代表拉尔，12日向联合国秘书长提出了一项备忘录，正式提议将中国在联合国的代表权问题列入本届联大议程。这个提议符合于联合国会员国和各国人民的普遍愿望。现在，不仅社会主义国家和其他大多数承认我国的国家，而且还有越来越多的尚未与我国建立外交关系的国家，都认为拥有六亿人口的中华人民共和国至今仍被排斥在联合国之外，是严重损害着联合国的威信和作用的，必须立即加以纠正。中国人民欢迎和支持印度的这个提议。为了维护联合国宪章的尊严，本届联大应该接受印度的提议，立即恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法权利和地位。
    七年来，伟大的中华人民共和国正日益强大地发展着，它坚持不渝地奉行和平外交政策，尊重联合国宪章，并实际上执行着宪章关于维护和平和促进国际合作的崇高任务，因而它的国际威望和在国际事务中所起的作用正日益增长。这个事实是全世界愈来愈多的国家和广大舆论所一致公认的。印度在备忘录中也指出了这些不容抹煞的事实。正如印度备忘录所指出的，只有中华人民共和国政府，才是能够在联合国代表中国的唯一政府，只有它才有能力并且准备代表中国人民履行根据宪章所承担的会员国的义务。因此，剥夺中国政府的代表权，不仅同联合国宪章和联合国对待会员国的惯例相抵触，而且还同联合国的利益、促进世界和平事业和国际合作相抵触。
    大家知道，造成长期剥夺中华人民共和国在联合国的代表权的完全不能容忍的不正常情况，是美国把敌视中国人民、敌视和平和国际合作的政策强加在联合国“多数”会员国的结果。尽管美国这个政策不符合联合国和会员国的利益，引起越来越多的国家的不满和反对，但是美国政府还是年复一年地以种种蛮横手段强迫联大“延期审议”。臭名远扬的美国所谓“院外援华集团”头子诺兰，今年4月在大肆叫嚣反对恢复我国在联合国的合法权利的时候不得不承认，苏联和其他社会主义国家、中立国家以及“我们的某些盟国”都“强烈地”主张我国应在联合国取得席位。另一个敌对中国人民的美国驻加拿大大使麦钱特也承认，对美国的远东政策缺乏同情和谅解，“主要是同我们对共产党中国的政策有关”，而人们称这种政策是“僵硬的”和“短视的”。可是，美国反动集团仍不择手段地对它的伙伴们施加压力，企图继续剥夺我国在联合国的代表权。它们口口声声说什么尊重联合国宪章和各国人民选择自己的政府的权利，实际上却是对宪章和各国人民的这种神圣权利进行最放肆最无耻的践踏。美国顽固地继续执行这种不现实的政策，是同它正在远东和全世界制造不信任和敌对，保持和加剧紧张局势的阴险计划分不开的。
    目前美国在十一届联大中正在继续强迫“多数”会员国“延期审议”我国代表权的迫切问题。14日，在联大总务委员会会议上，美国代表伙同英国和其他国家，通过了美国的提案，竟要联大漠视印度关于将中国代表权问题列入大会议程的正当建议，拒绝在本届联大审议这个问题。美国操纵总务委员会通过的这个决定，粗暴地违反联合国宪章和会员国的普遍愿望，我们对此不能不提出严重的抗议。而已经承认我国的英国的代表却继续追随美国，对中国人民采取极不友好的政策，我们对此不能不表示莫大的愤慨。
    但是，美国剥夺我国在联合国的代表权的专横行为，过去不能、将来也决不能损害中国，而只能损害联合国的威信和作用，损害美国和附和美国敌视中国人民的政策的国家自己，这是七年来的事实已经证明了的。本届联大承担着制止侵略埃及，和缓国际紧张局势的紧迫任务，所有爱好和平、愿意维护联合国宪章的国家，都必须击败美国阻挠本届联大完成这个神圣任务的阴谋，决不能再让美国敌视中国人民的政策在联合国中得逞。观察家评论
