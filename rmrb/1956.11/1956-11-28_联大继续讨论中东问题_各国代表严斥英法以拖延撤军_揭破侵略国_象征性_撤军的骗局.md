Xinhua News Agency, November 27th, New York: The United Nations General Assembly continued its plenary session on the morning and afternoon of November 26th to discuss the Middle East issue. On the 24th, the General Assembly had already adopted a proposal from the Asian-African group of nations, once again demanding that the British, French, and Israeli aggressive forces immediately withdraw from Egypt.

The representatives of Arab nations at the meeting vehemently criticized the unprovoked aggression of Britain, France, and Israel against Egypt. Saudi Arabian representative Dejani said that the use of force by Britain and France in Egypt had "opened the eyes in time" of Saudi Arabia and all Arabs, because in the past, Britain and France "had always pretended to be friends of the Arabs." The actions taken by Britain and France were "unforgettable acts of treachery." Dejani pointed out that Britain, France, and Israel are currently trying to have the United Nations Emergency Force take over the territories they occupy in Egypt. He said that Saudi Arabia opposes any attempt to make the solution of the Palestine and Suez Canal issues a condition for withdrawing troops. The continued disregard of the United Nations General Assembly resolutions by the three aggressor nations will only create a situation fraught with dangerous consequences. He demanded that Britain, France, and Israel be held responsible for all the losses their acts of aggression have brought to Egypt.

Lebanese representative Rizk also exposed the conspiracy of Britain, France, and Israel to delay the withdrawal of troops. He warned that "if the aggressors do not withdraw their troops immediately, the fire in the Middle East may develop into a fire that spreads throughout the world." The United Nations General Assembly should not in any way help the aggressors achieve their "stated or unstated war aims."

The Liberian representative condemned the deceptive "symbolic" troop withdrawal by Britain, France, and Israel, saying that such a withdrawal is "partial" and "superficial," and it does not help to achieve the desired results or alleviate the very critical situation.

Indian representative Menon said that his government instructed him to point out that India is willing to maintain "friendly relations" with Britain, France, and Israel. He said, "Although our attitude may be stern, it is not out of any hatred we have."

Menon said that the issue of the status of the United Nations Emergency Force is a "matter entirely for the United Nations to handle." But he also believed that only Egypt has the right to decide which countries' troops can enter Egypt.

Representatives from the Soviet Union, Ukraine, Czechoslovakia, and Albania continued to condemn the aggression of Britain, France, and Israel against Egypt and demanded that the aggressive forces immediately withdraw from Egypt. Soviet representative Kuznetsov pointed out that only when all foreign troops have withdrawn from Egypt is it possible to resolve other relevant issues. He said that the Soviet Union is ready to cooperate in seeking ways to clear the canal. However, the Soviet Union believes that the three aggressor nations, Britain, France, and Israel, should bear all the costs of clearing the canal and maintaining the United Nations Emergency Force. If this is not done, it would be tantamount to encouraging aggressors to harm other countries. The Soviet Union will refuse to bear such costs and will vote against any proposal requiring the United Nations to maintain such expenditures.

Representatives from Mexico, El Salvador, and Paraguay also opposed the United Nations member states bearing the costs of clearing the canal. Mexican representative Collina pointed out, "It is neither fair nor appropriate to now ask innocent countries to pay a portion of the cost of clearing the canal." El Salvadorian representative Uquia said, "It is those who are responsible for the situation in the Middle East who should bear this cost."

The Israeli representative defended Israel's failure to implement the General Assembly resolution and its delay in withdrawing troops. The representative of Guatemala openly spoke from the aggressor's position, asking not to doubt the "sincerity" of Britain's announcement of troop withdrawal. The Australian representative called on the United States and Britain to bridge their differences on the Middle East issue and "unite in mutual trust."

The meeting finally passed a proposal put forward by United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskjöld, which called for the establishment of a special fund of ten million US dollars to supply the United Nations Emergency Force. This fund will be raised outside the United Nations' normal budget. Before the establishment of this fund, funds needed to maintain this force will be allocated from the United Nations' revolving funds. The vote was fifty-two in favor, nine against, and thirteen abstentions. Those who voted against were the Soviet Union and the Eastern European People's Democracies.

    联大继续讨论中东问题
    各国代表严斥英法以拖延撤军
    揭破侵略国“象征性”撤军的骗局
    新华社27日讯　纽约消息：联合国大会11月26日上午和下午继续举行全体会议，讨论中东问题。大会在24日已经通过了亚非集团国家的一项提案，再一次要求英、法和以色列的侵略军队立即撤出埃及。
    阿拉伯国家的代表们在会议上猛烈抨击英、法和以色列对埃及的无端侵略。沙特阿拉伯代表德贾尼说，英法在埃及使用武力使沙特阿拉伯和所有阿拉伯人“及时睁开了眼睛”，因为在过去，英法“一直是装作阿拉伯的朋友的”。英法采取的行动是“使人忘不了的背信弃义的行为”。德贾尼指出，英、法和以色列目前正在设法使联合国紧急部队接管它们在埃及占领的地方。他说，沙特阿拉伯反对以解决巴勒斯坦和苏伊士运河问题作为撤退军队的条件的任何企图。三个侵略国家继续漠视联合国大会的决议只会造成充满危险后果的局势。他要求英、法和以色列对它们的侵略行为给埃及带来的一切损失负责。
    黎巴嫩代表里兹克也揭露了英、法和以色列拖延撤军的阴谋。他警告说，“如果侵略者不立即撤军，中东之火就可能发展成为遍及全世界的大火”。联合国大会不应当以任何方式帮助侵略者达到他们的“明说的或者没有明说的战争目的”。
    利比里亚代表斥责英、法和以色列的“象征性”撤军的骗局，他说，这种撤军是“部分的”和“表面的”，它并不能有助于达到预期的结果或者缓和非常危急的局势。
    印度代表梅农说，他的政府指示他指出这一点，就是印度愿意继续和英、法和以色列保持“友好关系”。他说，“尽管我们的态度可能是严厉的，但是这并不是出于我们有任何仇恨”。
    梅农说，联合国紧急部队的地位问题是一个“完全需要由联合国来处理的问题”。但是他同时认为，只有埃及才有权决定哪一个国家的部队可以进入埃及。
    苏联、乌克兰、捷克斯洛伐克和阿尔巴尼亚等国家的代表继续谴责英、法和以色列对埃及的侵略，并且要求侵略军马上撤出埃及。苏联代表库兹涅佐夫指出，只有在所有外国军队撤出埃及的情况下，其他有关问题才有解决的可能。他说，苏联准备进行合作，以谋求清理运河的办法。但是，苏联认为，英、法和以色列这三个侵略国家应该承担清理运河以及供养联合国紧急部队的全部费用，如果不是这样做，就等于鼓励侵略者们损害其他国家。苏联将拒绝承担这种费用，并且将投票反对要求联合国来维持这种开支的任何提案。
    墨西哥、萨尔瓦多和巴拉圭的代表也反对由联合国会员国来承担清理运河的费用。墨西哥代表柯林纳指出，“现在要求毫无罪过的国家去交纳一部分清理运河的费用是既不公平又不合适的。”萨尔瓦多代表乌基亚说，“正是那些要对中东局势负责的人才应该把这种费用担负起来。”
    以色列代表为以色列没有执行大会决议，拖延撤退军队的行为辩解。危地马拉的代表公开站在侵略者的立场上发言，要求不要怀疑英国宣布撤军的“诚意”。澳大利亚代表要求美英两国在中东问题上弥补分歧，“在互相信任中团结起来”。
    会议最后通过了联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德提出的一项提案，这项提案要求设立一项一千万美元的特别基金来供应联合国紧急部队，这笔基金将在联合国的正常预算以外筹措，在设立这项基金以前，从联合国的周转资金内调拨维持这支部队所需要的款项。表决的情况是：五十二票赞成，九票反对和十三票弃权。投反对票的是苏联和东欧人民民主国家。
