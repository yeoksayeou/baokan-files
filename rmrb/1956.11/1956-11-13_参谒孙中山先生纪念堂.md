    Visiting Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall
    Our Staff Reporter
    Yesterday was the 90th anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's birth. Representatives from various democratic parties and people's organizations in the capital, along with international friends invited to China to participate in the commemorative meeting, visited Sun Yat-sen's Memorial Hall and cenotaph at the Temple of Azure Clouds in Xiangshan, in the western suburbs.
    Thirty-one years ago, Mr. Sun Yat-sen passed away in Beijing, and his coffin was once placed in the Temple of Azure Clouds. Since then, every year on the anniversary of Mr. Sun's birth and death, people have come here in an endless stream to pay their respects to this great revolutionary forerunner.
    Those who came to pay their respects all travelled by bus. In the last bus were Comrades Zhou Enlai, Deng Xiaoping, Guo Moruo, and Mr. and Mrs. Wen Youzhang.
    The Temple of Azure Clouds is at the foot of Xiangshan Mountain. Every autumn, the mountains are covered with red leaves. Now that it is early winter, only the verdant pines, firs, and cypresses stand tall. The buses wound their way up the stone-paved road. At 10:00 AM, all the members of the delegation arrived at the Temple of Azure Clouds. Thousands of visitors from the Central Party School of the Communist Party of China, Tsinghua University, and other organizations had been waiting for a long time.
    The Memorial Hall is in the center of the Temple of Azure Clouds, and the interior and exterior have been newly painted. A red plaque under the eaves of the main hall reads "Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall," with calligraphy by Madame Soong Ching Ling. In the center of the Memorial Hall is a statue of Mr. Sun Yat-sen. The hall is filled with the fragrance of fresh flowers. The walls are made of white marble, on which is carved "Sun Yat-sen's Letter to the Soviet Union." Reading this familiar letter again, one silently says: Mr. Sun, rest in peace! The people of China and the Soviet Union have formed an unbreakable brotherly friendship.
    At 10:30 AM, the visitation ceremony was held. Zhou Enlai, He Xiangning, Guo Moruo, Chen Shutong, Deng Xiaoping, Shen Junru, Cheng Qian, Fu Zuoyi, Zhang Zhizhong, Tan Huiquan, and others entered the Memorial Hall and stood silently in front of Mr. Sun's statue to pay their respects.
    Outside the Memorial Hall, in the courtyard, stood thousands of visitors. Among them were workers, peasants, and intellectuals from the capital, overseas Chinese and compatriots from Hong Kong and Macao, elderly people who had experienced the entire history of the Chinese democratic revolution, and Young Pioneers who had just learned the name of Mr. Sun Yat-sen and his immortal cause. International friends were together with Chinese comrades. They also stood silently to pay their respects.
    The highest respect and deep remembrance were contained in the silence.
    The six hundred million people of China have inherited and carried forward Mr. Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary cause. After Mr. Sun's death, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the entire people completed the democratic revolution that Mr. Sun Yat-sen had not completed, and developed this revolution into a socialist revolution. The Chinese people are commemorating Mr. Sun with a victorious heart. The motherland has gained independence and freedom. Our country has united with all "nations that treat us as equals." The constitution guarantees the democratic rights of all the people. The vast number of peasants are marching towards the road of collectivization. The great industrialization plan is being carried out on a comprehensive scale with unprecedented scale.
    Comrade Zhou Enlai, representing the six hundred million people who are victoriously building socialism, presented a bouquet of flowers in front of Mr. Sun's statue.
    Then He Xiangning also presented a bouquet of flowers. She represented the revolutionary Kuomintang members. For more than thirty years, they have done tremendous work to realize the Three People's Principles of alliance with Russia, alliance with the Communist Party, and assistance to agriculture and workers.
    Afterwards, the visitors toured the exhibition rooms on both sides of the Memorial Hall and went to the stone pagoda to pay respects to Mr. Sun's cenotaph. An old man with a silver beard, Tan Huiquan, who was Mr. Sun Yat-sen's bodyguard, insisted on accompanying Comrade Zhou Enlai to climb the one hundred and eight steps of the stone pagoda. This pagoda, originally named the Vajra Throne Pagoda, was built in imitation of Indian Buddhist pagodas. Mr. Sun Yat-sen's clothing is sealed in the base of the pagoda. The pagoda is more than thirty feet high, and from the top of the pagoda, the scenery of the Western Hills is fully visible. On the platform at the base of the pagoda, there stands a white bark pine tree with nine branches growing towards the sky. The old man said to Comrade Zhou Enlai, "This pine tree has a story." It is said that this pine tree was conferred a title by Emperor Qianlong and named the Nine Dragons Pine. Later, nine emperors emerged in the Qing Dynasty. Comrade Zhou Enlai asked, "Didn't the Qing Dynasty have ten emperors?" The old man thought for a moment and said, "Pu Yi doesn't count." Comrade Zhou Enlai said, "Oh, yes, he doesn't count. Pu Yi was overthrown by Mr. Sun." Comrade Zhou Enlai, the old man, and the surrounding comrades all laughed.
    By the time they came down from the white pagoda, it was noon. The visitors took a short break and then boarded the buses back to the city. Looking back at Xiangshan, the Temple of Azure Clouds was nestled among ancient cypresses and pines.

    参谒孙中山先生纪念堂
    本报记者
    昨天是孙中山先生诞辰九十周年纪念日，首都各民主党派和人民团体的代表，和应邀来我国参加纪念大会的国际友人们，到西郊香山碧云寺，参谒了孙中山先生的纪念堂和衣冠冡。
    三十一年前，中山先生在北京逝世，他的灵柩曾经停放在碧云寺。从那时起，每年逢到先生诞辰和逝世纪念日，人们便络绎不绝地到这里参谒，向这位伟大的革命先行者致敬。
    参谒的人都是乘公共汽车去的。在最后一辆车里坐着的，有周恩来、邓小平、郭沫若等同志，和文幼章夫妇。
    碧云寺在香山脚下。每逢深秋，满山红叶。如今已到初冬，只有苍翠的松杉桧柏挺立着。汽车在石板铺的路上盘旋而上。十时，代表团人员全部到达碧云寺。中共中央高级党校，清华大学等单位的上千名参谒者已经等候很久了。
    纪念堂在碧云寺的中央，室内外油漆一新。正厅檐下一块“孙中山纪念堂”的红色匾额，题字是宋庆龄先生手笔。纪念堂正中是一尊中山先生的塑像。满室鲜花飘散着清香。两壁是用汉白玉石砌成的，上面雕凿着“孙中山致苏联遗书”。重读一遍这封人们都很熟悉的遗书，心里会这样默念：先生，您安息吧！中苏两国人民，已经结成了牢不可破的兄弟般的友谊。
    十时三十分，举行了参谒仪式。周恩来、何香凝、郭沫若、陈叔通、邓小平、沈钧儒、程潜、傅作义、张治中、谭惠全等走进纪念堂，在先生塑像前面静默肃立致敬。
    纪念堂外面的院子里站着上千名参谒者。他们当中，有首都的工人、农民、知识分子，有海外华侨和港澳同胞，有曾经经历了中国民主革命全部历史的老人，也有刚刚知道了中山先生的名字和他的不朽的事业的红领巾。国际友人们和中国同志在一起。他们也都静默肃立致敬。
    无言中包藏着最高的崇敬和深深的怀念。
    中国六亿人民，继承和发扬了孙中山先生的革命事业。先生逝世以后，全体人民在中国共产党领导下，完成了孙中山先生没有完成的民主革命，并且把这个革命发展为社会主义革命。中国人民是怀着胜利的心情来纪念中山先生的。祖国已经得到了独立和自由。我国已经同一切“以平等待我之民族”团结在一起。宪法保障了全体人民的民主权利。广大农民正在向着集体化的道路迈进。伟大的工业化的计划正在以空前未有的规模全面开展。
    代表正在胜利地建设着社会主义的六亿人民，周恩来同志在先生像前捧献了香花一束。
    接着何香凝也献上香花一束。她代表的是革命的国民党人。三十多年来，他们曾为实现联俄、联共、扶助农工的三大政策的三民主义，进行了巨大的工作。
    随后，参谒的人们参观了纪念堂两侧的展览室，并且到石塔瞻仰先生的衣冠冡。一位银髯垂胸的老人、孙中山先生生前的卫士谭惠全，坚持要陪同周恩来同志一起登临一百零八层台阶的石塔。这座塔，原名金刚宝座塔，是仿照印度佛塔建成的。中山先生的衣冠就封藏在塔基里面。塔高三十余丈，登塔了望，西山景色尽在眼底。在塔基平台上，兀立着一棵白皮松，朝天长着九根枝杈。老人向周恩来同志说：“这棵松有个典故”，据说，这棵松树曾受乾隆皇帝加封，命名九龙松。后来清朝便出了九个皇帝。周恩来同志问道：“清朝不是有十个皇帝吗？”老人想了一下，说：“溥仪不能算数”。周恩来同志说：“喔，是的，不能算数，溥仪给孙先生打倒了。”周恩来同志、老人和周围的同志一起都笑了。
    从白塔下来，已经晌午。参谒的人稍事休歇，先后登车回城。回首香山，碧云寺在古柏苍松间。
