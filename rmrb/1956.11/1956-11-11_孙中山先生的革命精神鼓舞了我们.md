    Dr. Sun Yat-sen was a great democratic revolutionary and patriot who struggled for the freedom and equality of the motherland throughout his life and should be eternally remembered by the people of the whole country. As a follower of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, on the occasion of the ninetieth anniversary of the birth of this great man of the generation, I cannot help but recall some memories of the past.
    In 1910, I was studying at Liangjiang Normal School in Nanjing, and I joined the Tongmenghui (Chinese United League) through the introduction of Comrade Peng Sumin. In the following year, the Xinhai Revolution broke out, and I returned to Jiangxi to participate in the Jiujiang and Nanchang uprisings. Later, the Tongmenghui merged with several other small parties to form the Kuomintang. At that time, imitating the parliamentary systems of European and American countries, national and provincial council elections were held throughout the country, and I was elected as a member of the Jiangxi Provincial Council. Then, Yuan Shikai's crimes of undermining the Provisional Constitution, assassinating Song Jiaoren, illegally borrowing heavily, and removing the military governors of the five southern provinces, which harmed the Republic of China, occurred one after another. Therefore, the Jiangxi Provincial Council first announced Jiangxi's independence and elected Li Liejun as the commander-in-chief, issuing a circular telegram denouncing Yuan. At the same time, various places in Nanjing responded successively, which was the "Second Revolution" called for by Dr. Sun Yat-sen, also known as the "Gan-Ning Campaign." Because after the Xinhai Revolution, many warlords, bureaucrats, local tyrants, and evil gentry mixed into the Kuomintang, the party's revolutionary spirit was weakened from then on. In addition, the upper-level figures within the Kuomintang had differences of opinion and did not agree with Dr. Sun's proposal to go to Nanjing to preside over military affairs in person. Therefore, the "Second Revolution" quickly failed. Dr. Sun Yat-sen and other important party members left the country one after another and fled to Japan. I was also listed as wanted by the Yuan government and fled from Shanghai to Tokyo. There, I met Dr. Sun Yat-sen for the first time. The time was in the winter of 1913, and the place was in the residence of Mitsuru Toyama. At that time, due to Yuan's fierce flames in the country, all revolutionary forces were reduced to nothing. The Kuomintang, including some leaders, could not withstand the attack of the storm and wavered. Some people even broke away from the revolution at this time, and Wang Jingwei was one of the most prominent examples. Among the exiles in Tokyo, there were also many people who adopted a wait-and-see attitude, and even the so-called heroic Mr. Huang Xing advocated prudence and slow progress and did not agree with re-organizing the party. When Dr. Sun Yat-sen received us for the first time, he sharply criticized this negative concept. He firmly advocated active progress, and Dr. Sun Yat-sen clearly pointed out: "I expect Yuan Shikai to become emperor in a few years. We should quickly form a party and prepare to accuse and attack him as soon as Yuan proclaims himself emperor, so that his dream of becoming emperor cannot be realized and he cannot sit still, otherwise it will bring great difficulties to the revolutionary cause." This conversation strengthened our belief in Dr. Sun Yat-sen and strengthened our confidence in revolutionary progress.
    After that, we often went to see Dr. Sun Yat-sen. Dr. Sun Yat-sen earnestly said to us: When he was in Nanjing, he knew that Yuan Shikai would not be loyal to the Republic of China, and he was not willing to give way to Yuan Shikai. However, there were many people in the Kuomintang who did not support him, and even Wang Jingwei said that if we did not give way, others would say that we were fighting for power and gain. Therefore, the fruits of the victory of the Xinhai Revolution were easily stolen by the Beiyang warlords headed by Yuan Shikai. Dr. Sun Yat-sen once said to us painfully: The Kuomintang is a pile of loose sand, a mob. I don't want this party anymore, I have to start all over again in the future. At that time, he was preparing to organize the Chinese Revolutionary Party. He was very happy to see us coming and encouraged us to continue our efforts and reorganize our forces. His indomitable and persevering spirit deeply moved us. I, along with several other comrades from the Tongmenghui in Jiangxi, took an oath in front of Dr. Sun Yat-sen to join the Chinese Revolutionary Party. As far as I know, only more than one hundred people joined the Chinese Revolutionary Party in the first batch. Some old Kuomintang soldiers who remained in Tokyo, taking a wait-and-see attitude, did not participate in this organization on the grounds that they were unwilling to put their fingerprints on the documents.
    Besides revolutionary work, Dr. Sun Yat-sen's only hobby was reading. I remember when I visited him at Mitsuru Toyama's residence, he lived in only a few small Japanese-style houses, and there were many books in the study, especially English newspapers and periodicals. After he returned to China, he was always reading, even in the midst of busy military affairs and in difficult and dangerous situations. Because he was studious and thoughtful, and widely came into contact with the advanced ideas of the world, he was always more aware of the general trend of the world and had higher and farther-reaching views than others of his generation.
    Dr. Sun Yat-sen was very frugal in his personal life. In Tokyo, he lived the life of a revolutionary exile, not to mention. Even later, when he returned to China and served as Grand Marshal, he remained the same. In his revolutionary activities, overseas Chinese, especially the poorest laborers, donated a lot of money, bit by bit, penny by penny, to support the revolutionary cause of the motherland. He handed it over to the comrades in charge of managing the funds, and never lightly touched a penny, no matter how difficult he was. In his will to his wife when he passed away, he wrote: "Because I have devoted myself to national affairs, I have not managed family property..." He had nothing but books after his death. This frugal and honest style was rare among politicians at the time.
    Dr. Sun Yat-sen was approachable, and he often maintained close contact with party comrades and young friends. When he was the Grand Marshal in Guangzhou, he was very busy planning the Northern Expedition's military and political work. As ordinary party members, we could still often see him. At that time, we were still young, and we often blurted out whatever we heard, saw, and felt in front of Dr. Sun, and he always listened patiently. If what we said was correct, he would adopt it; if what we said was incorrect, he would explain it at any time. He was never harsh. This democratic style is an indispensable quality of a revolutionary leader.
    Dr. Sun Yat-sen also paid attention to organizing forces from all sides to oppose the common enemy. As long as it was beneficial to the revolution, he never narrowly cared about the grievances of a single party or individual. Some people who had opposed him in the past, as long as they showed a tendency towards revolution, he would embrace them with a kind attitude. For example, in 1922, when Dr. Sun Yat-sen was supervising the Northern Expedition in Shaoguan, the revolutionary army had already entered southern Jiangxi. I and several Jiangxi comrades heard that Dr. Sun had internally decided to appoint Xie Yuanhan as the governor of Jiangxi. Xie was originally a person in charge of the Progressive Party. After our campaign against Yuan failed, he took the lead in jointly reporting us, petitioned Yuan Shikai to order our arrest, and occupied the original Kuomintang Party Headquarters as the Progressive Party Headquarters. Therefore, when we heard the news that he was internally appointed as the governor of Jiangxi, we went to see Dr. Sun. We said to Dr. Sun, "Xie is from the Progressive Party, does Dr. Sun know?" Dr. Sun replied:
  "I know, but now he has joined our party." We then told Dr. Sun about Xie's reactionary deeds in Jiangxi. Dr. Sun thought for a while and replied, "Would it be good if I announced that you will be the governor? Unfortunately, the people of Jiangxi don't know you. Not only do the people of Jiangxi know Xie Yuanhan, but the officials and gentry in the north also know him. He has changed, and announcing that he will be the governor can not only influence the old personnel in Jiangxi, but also influence the old forces in the north." After hearing this explanation, we all admired Dr. Sun's brilliance. In today's words, Dr. Sun understood the principle of the united front very well. For example, Chen Jiongming, who openly rebelled in 1922, led his troops to surround the presidential palace and bombard Guanyin Mountain, trying to put Dr. Sun Yat-sen to death. At that time, Dr. Sun Yat-sen took refuge on the Yongfeng warship in Huangpu. I rushed to this ship to report the military situation in southern Jiangxi to Dr. Sun, and Dr. Sun handed me his order to send to the front line, ordering the troops to return to Guangdong to suppress the rebellion. In our opinion, Chen Jiongming, this heinous element, was unforgivable. Later, someone spoke in favor of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, and Dr. Sun Yat-sen said that as long as he sincerely repented and wrote a letter of repentance, it would be fine. His generosity was such. Because of this, many people, under the influence of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's spirit, changed from resisting the revolution to supporting the revolution.
    Speaking of the principled issues of the revolution, Dr. Sun Yat-sen never compromised. The most prominent example is that when Dr. Sun Yat-sen began to unite with the Communist Party, several persons in charge of the Kuomintang Guangdong branch wrote a long letter to Dr. Sun Yat-sen, expressing their opposition. Dr. Sun Yat-sen added detailed marginal notes to the letter, severely criticizing their suspicion of the Communist Party, and explaining that only by adopting the policies of alliance with Russia, alliance with the Communist Party, and assistance to peasants and workers can the Chinese revolution be carried out. He firmly believed in the implementation of the Three Great Policies. He even resolutely said to some stubborn elements: "If you continue to oppose, I will dissolve the Kuomintang, and I will personally join the Communist Party."
    Dr. Sun Yat-sen was such a great pioneer of democratic revolution. His thoughts continued to advance with the times. Especially in his later years, he reached his most glorious peak.
    Dr. Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary spirit has inspired those of us who have followed him to move forward on the revolutionary road consistently. Together with the people of the whole country, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, we have realized and surpassed Dr. Sun Yat-sen's ideals of striving for national independence, democratic rights, and people's livelihood and happiness throughout his life. However, many people, after Dr. Sun Yat-sen's death, took a completely opposite path, so that today they are trapped in Taiwan, relying on others. History has fully proved that the path they have taken is extremely wrong and dangerous. I hope that on the occasion of the ninetieth anniversary of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's birth, they can review Dr. Sun's teachings, respond to the motherland's call for "patriotism as one family," strive to achieve the peaceful liberation of Taiwan, and return to the embrace of the motherland. This is their only bright path to serve the country and save themselves.

    孙中山先生的革命精神鼓舞了我们
    陈劭先
    孙中山先生是一个伟大的民主革命家和爱国者，为争取祖国的自由平等奋斗了一生，应该受到全国人民永恒的纪念。作为孙中山先生的信徒的我，时逢这位一代伟人的九十诞辰纪念，不能不引起过去年代的几点回忆。
    1910年，我在南京两江师范学堂读书，由彭素民同志介绍，参加了同盟会。次年辛亥革命爆发，我回到江西，参加了九江、南昌起义。后来同盟会与其他几个小党派合并，组成国民党。那时模仿欧美各国的议会制度，全国举行国会和省议会选举，我就被选为江西省议会的议员。接着袁世凯破坏约法、暗杀宋教仁、违法大借款、免除南方五省督军等危害民国的罪行不断发生。于是江西省议会首先宣布江西独立，推举李烈钧为总司令。通电讨袁。同时南京各处相继响应，这就是孙中山先生所号召的“二次革命”，又叫做“赣宁之役”。由于辛亥革命后，许多军阀官僚、土豪劣绅，混进了国民党，党的革命精神从此削弱了，加以国民党内的上层人物意见分歧，没有同意先生亲自前往南京主持军事的主张，所以，“二次革命”很快就失败了。中山先生及其他重要党人相继离国，亡命日本。我也被袁政府列名通缉，从上海逃到东京。在那里，我第一次会见了中山先生。时间是在1913年冬，地点在头山满宅。那时由于国内袁氏的凶焰熏天，革命武力全归乌有。国民党内部，包括一部分领导人，经不起暴风雨的袭击，纷纷动摇。有些人竟在此时脱离了革命，汪精卫即是其中一个最显著的例子。在东京的亡命客中，也有不少人采取徘徊观望的态度，甚至号称英勇的黄兴先生也主张持重缓进，不赞成重新组党。中山先生第一次接见我们，便十分尖锐地批判了这种消极的观念。力主积极进行，中山先生并明确指出：“我料袁世凯不出几年就要做皇帝，我们应该赶快组党，准备袁一称帝，即申罪致讨，要使他的皇帝梦做不成、坐不稳，否则就会带给革命事业以很大的困难”。这一次的谈话，更有力地坚定了我们对中山先生的信仰，也就加强了我们对革命前进的信心。
    此后，我们时常去见中山先生。中山先生恳切地对我们说：在南京的时候，他就知道袁世凯是不会忠于民国的，他并不愿意让位给袁世凯。可是，就在国民党内也有许多人不支持他，连汪精卫都说，我们如不让位，别人就会说我们争权夺利。因此，辛亥革命的胜利果实，就轻易地被以袁世凯为首的北洋军阀窃夺去了。中山先生曾沉痛地对我们说：国民党是一盘散沙，乌合之众。这个党我不要了，今后要重新来过。那时他正着手组织中华革命党，看到我们到来很高兴，勉励我们继续努力，重整旗鼓。他那种不屈不挠、百折不回的精神，深深地感动了我们。我便和其他几位从江西来的同盟会的同志一起，在中山先生的面前，宣誓加入了中华革命党。据我所知，第一批加入中华革命党的只有一百多人。有一部分采取观望的留在东京的旧国民党军人，借口不愿盖手印，没有参加这个组织。
    中山先生除革命工作以外，惟一的嗜好便是读书。我记得在头山满宅谒见他时，他住的只是几间很小的日本式房子，书房里图书很多，特别是英文的报刊。他回国以后，无论是在兵马倥偬之中，艰困危难之际，也经常手不释卷。由于他好学深思，广泛地接触到世界的先进思想，所以在他的同代人中间，始终比别人更明了世界大势，见解更高更远。
    中山先生自奉甚为俭约。在东京的时候过着革命流亡者的生活，不用多说了。就是后来回国担任大元帅职务时，也依然如故。在他从事革命活动中，海外华侨，特别是那些最穷苦的侨工，一点一滴，铢极寸累，捐了很多钱来支援祖国的革命事业。他都交给负责掌管经费的同志，无论自己如何困难，从不轻动一文。他逝世时，给夫人的遗嘱中写道：“余因尽瘁国事，不治家产……”他身后除书籍外，别无长物。这种俭朴的廉洁的风度，在当时的政治家中，是很少见的。
    中山先生平易近人，他经常与党内同志和青年朋友，保持着密切的联系。他在广州任大元帅时，策划北伐军政工作很忙。我们只是作为一个普通的党员，仍然可以常去见他。当时我们还年轻，凡有所闻、所见、所感，往往在先生面前，不假思索地脱口而出，他总是耐心倾听。说得对的地方即加以采纳；说得不对的，即随时加以解释。从无疾言厉色。这种民主作风，是革命领导者不可缺少的品格。
    中山先生也很注意组织各方面的力量，反对共同的敌人。只要对革命有利，他从不狭隘地计较一党一人的恩怨。有些过去反对他的人，只要一旦表示倾向革命，他都抱着与人为善的态度，加以接纳。例如，1922年中山先生在韶关督师北伐，这时革命军已经进入赣南，我和几个江西同志听说先生已经内定谢远涵为江西省长，谢原是进步党的一个负责人，在我们讨袁失败以后，他曾带头连名检举我们，上书袁世凯下令通缉，并且占用了原国民党党部作为进步党的党部。所以我们听说内定他为江西省长的消息，就去见先生。我们向先生说：“谢是进步党，先生知道吗？”先生回答说：
  “知道，但是现在他已经参加了我们的党。”我们再把谢在江西的反动事实告诉先生，先生考虑了一下回答我们说：“我发表你们去当省长好不好，可惜江西人都不知道你们，谢远涵不但江西人都知道他，北方的官绅也都知道他，他转变过来了，发表他当省长，不但可以影响江西的旧人员，而且可以影响北方的旧势力。”我们听了这番解释以后，都佩服先生的高明，用今天的话来说，先生是很懂得统一战线的道理的。再如1922年公然叛变的陈炯明，曾率部包围总统府、炮击观音山，欲将中山先生置之于死地。当时中山先生避于黄埔的永丰兵舰上。我曾赶到这个舰上向中山先生报告赣南军情，先生当将他的手令交我送达前线，班师回粤讨逆。像陈炯明这个罪大恶极的分子，在我们看来是十恶不赦的。后来，有人向中山先生缓颊，中山先生说，只要他真诚悔过，写一张悔过书就可以。其豁达大度有如此者。因为这样，就有不少人，在中山先生这种精神的感召下，从抗拒革命变为拥护革命。
    说到革命的原则问题，中山先生是从不含糊迁就的。最突出的一个例子，是中山先生开始联共的时候，国民党广东省支部的几个负责人，写了一封长信给中山先生，表示反对。中山先生在信上加了详细的眉批，严厉地批判了他们对共产党的怀疑，并说明只有采取联俄，联共，扶助农工的政策，才能进行中国的革命。他对三大政策的执行是深信不疑的。他甚至毅然决然地对一些顽固分子说：“你们如再反对，我就解散国民党，我个人去加入共产党好了。”
    中山先生便是这样一位伟大的民主革命先驱者。他的思想不断随着时代前进。特别是他的晚年，更达到了最光辉的高峰。
    中山先生的革命精神鼓舞了我们这些追随过他的人，始终如一地向着革命的道路前进。我们和全国人民一道，在中国共产党的领导下，已经把中山先生奋斗一生，争取民族独立、民权自由、民生幸福的理想变为现实，而且超过了。但是有不少人在中山先生逝世以后，就走了完全相反的道路，以致今日困处台湾，随人俯仰，历史已经充分证明他们所走的道路是极端错误而危险的。我希望他们在这纪念中山先生诞辰九十周年的时候，能够重温一遍先生的遗教，响应祖国“爱国一家”的号召，争取实现和平解放台湾，回到祖国的怀抱。这是他们报效国家和挽救自己的唯一光明道路。
