Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, November 6th. The Harbin Municipal People's Committee held a meeting at the end of October to reward four outstanding units and eleven outstanding workers for resettling demobilized soldiers.

The Harbin Linen Textile Factory, which received an award, has consistently attached importance to the resettlement of demobilized soldiers in recent years. The factory allocates work to demobilized soldiers according to the principle of "matching talent to position." In order to enable demobilized soldiers to quickly master the technology, they also adopt training methods such as master-apprentice or sending them to factory technical schools to learn, so that these demobilized soldiers can quickly participate in actual operation in the workshop. Of the 124 demobilized soldiers received by the factory this year, 87 have become skilled technical workers. In the factory's advanced producer movement, 27 demobilized soldiers were rated as advanced producers, and eight were promoted to workshop directors, foremen, deputy foremen, and car wiping team leaders to lead workshop work.

The Harbin Branch of the People's Bank of China and other units and individuals were also rewarded.

    哈尔滨市奖励安置复员军人的优秀单位和个人
    新华社哈尔滨6日电　哈尔滨市人民委员会10月底开会奖励了四个安置复员军人的优秀单位和十一名优秀工作者。
    受到奖励的哈尔滨亚麻纺织厂，几年来一贯重视复员军人的安置工作。这个厂根据“适才适所”的原则来分配复员军人的工作。为了使复员军人能很快地掌握技术，还采取师傅带徒弟或是送到工厂技术学校学习等培养方法，使这些复员军人很快就能在车间里参加实际操作。今年这个厂接收的一百二十四名复员军人，已经有八十七名成了熟练的技术工人。在全厂的先进生产者运动中，有二十七名复员军人被评为先进生产者，并且有八个人被提拔为车间主任、工长、副工长和擦车队长等车间领导工作。
    受到奖励的还有中国人民银行哈尔滨市分行等单位和个人。
