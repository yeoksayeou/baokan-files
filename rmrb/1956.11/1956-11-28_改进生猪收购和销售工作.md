    Improve Hog Procurement and Sales Work
    In the past period, the Liuyang County Food Company in Hunan Province, during its hog procurement work, severely damaged the farmers' enthusiasm for raising pigs by forcibly purchasing hogs beyond the state-assigned procurement quotas. This phenomenon has now been largely overcome, and the unreasonable "examination trough" system has also been abolished. Therefore, the New Hunan Daily published an editorial on the 11th of this month, requiring all counties in Hunan to value the experience of Liuyang County, establish a production-oriented viewpoint in hog procurement work, earnestly care for the interests of the masses, and do a good job in propaganda and explanation to the masses.

    The editorial said: The process of Liuyang County's improvement in hog procurement and sales work shows that all activities of commercial workers should proceed from a viewpoint that benefits production. In hog procurement work, the Party and the government not only adopted the policy of state-assigned hog raising and procurement to guarantee the needs of export trade and urban and rural residents for meat, but also stipulated that farmers could freely slaughter for their own consumption, shared consumption, or sale those pigs raised beyond the state-assigned procurement quotas, in order to stimulate farmers' interest in raising hogs and develop hog production. However, in the past, many cadres of the Liuyang County Food Company disregarded production and only focused on procurement, even carrying scales to people's doors and forcibly purchasing hogs, taking even those beyond the quotas. This severely dampened the enthusiasm of the masses for hog production, not only affecting the completion of procurement tasks but also damaging the connection between the Party and the masses. Now, with the active assistance of the local Party and government leading organs, they have corrected these shortcomings and errors, correctly implemented the hog procurement policy, and focused their main energy on going deep into agricultural cooperatives to start with the development of production, helping agricultural cooperatives to formulate hog production plans, and helping them solve the difficulties in raising hogs in many ways. This has greatly stimulated the enthusiasm of the broad masses of farmers in raising hogs. Under these circumstances, hog production in Liuyang County will naturally be easier to develop in the future, and the hog procurement and sales tasks of the local Food Company will also be easier to complete.

    The editorial also said that hog procurement and sales work is a task that relates to the immediate economic lives of millions of people. Procurement personnel must highly value the interests of the masses, strengthen propaganda and explanation work to the masses, enlighten the masses' consciousness, and rely on the help of the masses to do it well. The editorial said that after the Liuyang County Food Company corrected the erroneous practices of "examination troughs" and deducting weight in hog procurement, they conducted in-depth propaganda and education work, making the masses understand that sending hogs with full stomachs for sale easily causes excessive losses and even causes the death of hogs, which is very unfavorable to the country and to the farmers, thereby enlightening the masses' awareness and gaining the support of the masses. The phenomenon of the masses sending hogs with full stomachs for sale has been greatly reduced. In order to further reverse the phenomenon of the masses sending hogs with full stomachs for sale, the editorial requires relevant departments to revise the current procurement specification standards and the method of pricing based only on gross weight, so that it is easy to grasp and can be willingly accepted by the farmers, so as to correctly implement the state's price policy of "taking care of the interests of production, transportation and sales, and consumers, and encouraging breed improvement and fattening."

### 改进生猪收购和销售工作

    改进生猪收购和销售工作
    过去一段期间，湖南浏阳县食品公司在收购生猪工作中，曾因强迫收购农民派购任务以外的生猪，以致严重损害了农民养猪的积极性。现在这种现象已大大克服，不合理的考槽制度也已废除。因此，新湖南报在本月11日发表社论，要求湖南各县重视浏阳县的经验，在收购生猪工作中树立生产观点，切实关心群众的利益，并做好对群众的宣传解释工作。
    社论说：浏阳县改进生猪购销工作的经过说明：商业工作人员的一切活动都应该从有利于生产的观点出发。在生猪收购工作中，党和政府不仅采取了生猪派养派购的政策，借以保证出口贸易和城乡人民对于肉食的需要，同时还规定完成派购任务以外的猪，农民可以自由的自宰自食、自宰分食，自宰出售，以刺激农民饲养生猪的兴趣，发展生猪生产。但过去，浏阳县食品公司的许多干部不问生产，只顾收购，甚至背秤上门，强迫收购，把派购以外的猪也包下来，结果严重地挫伤了群众生产生猪的积极性，不仅影响收购任务的完成，而且损害了党和群众的联系。现在，他们在当地党政领导机关的积极帮助下，纠正了这些缺点和错误，正确地贯彻执行了生猪收购政策，并且以主要精力深入农业社，从发展生产着手，帮助农业社制定生猪生产计划，从多方面帮助他们解决饲养生猪的困难，这就大大地激发了农民群众饲养生猪的积极性。在这种情况下，今后浏阳县的生猪生产自然容易发展起来，而当地食品公司的生猪购销任务也将便于完成。
    社论又说，生猪购销工作是一件关系着千百万群众切身经济生活的工作，收购人员必需高度关心群众利益，加强对群众的宣传解释工作，启发群众的自觉，依靠群众的帮助，才能把它做好。社论说，浏阳县食品公司纠正了在收购生猪工作中的考槽、扣秤等错误的作法以后，由于进行了深入的宣传教育工作，使群众懂得了送售饱肚猪容易造成过大的损耗，甚至引起生猪的死亡，对国家、对农民都非常不利，从而启发了群众的觉悟，取得了群众的支持，群众送售饱肚猪的现象已大大地减少。为进一步扭转群众送售饱肚猪的现象，社论要求有关部门修订现行的收购规格标准和只按毛重收购、作价的方法，使之既易于掌握，又能为农民群众乐意接受，以便正确地贯彻执行国家“照顾生产、运销和消费者的利益，鼓励品种改良和饲养肥猪”的价格政策。
