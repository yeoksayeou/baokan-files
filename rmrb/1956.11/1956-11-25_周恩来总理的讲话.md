Premier Zhou Enlai's Speech

Respected Speakers of the Royal Cambodian Council and National Assembly, and Members of Parliament:

Please allow me to first express my gratitude to you for granting me the honor of addressing this esteemed assembly. I regard this honor as one bestowed upon the Chinese people by the Cambodian people. On behalf of the Chinese people, I extend warm greetings to you, and through you, to the Cambodian people.

Although my colleagues and I have only been in your ancient and beautiful country for a day, we have already been deeply moved by the audience with His Majesty the King and Queen, the receptions personally hosted by Prince Sihanouk, His Excellency Penn Nouth, and Prime Minister San Yun, and the warm welcome from the Cambodian people. Wherever we go, we see the sincere friendship of the Cambodian people towards the Chinese people. We deeply feel that we have come to a close and friendly neighboring country.

For many centuries, our two peoples have had close ties and deep friendship. In Chinese historical records, as early as the third century AD, there were vivid records of your beautiful country and the interactions between the Chinese and Cambodian peoples. Due to the friendly exchanges between the two peoples, trade and cultural links developed between the two countries, enriching our two countries' economic and cultural lives. Cambodian monks once came to China to translate scriptures. Cambodian musicians also performed in China. Chinese historical records also specifically mention that the trade and commerce between the Chinese and Cambodian peoples proceeded relatively smoothly. These are historical records worth commemorating.

In the past century, due to colonialism's intrusion into Asia, the friendly exchanges between our two countries once faced artificial obstacles. However, the friendship between peoples can never be suppressed by colonialists. On the contrary, in the common struggle against colonialism and for the maintenance of national independence, we have deepened our mutual sympathy and concern. Now, the peoples of China and Cambodia, like the vast majority of peoples in the Asian region, have embarked on the path of independent development and become masters of their own destiny. Our two peoples will no longer allow any force to hinder us from restoring and developing our traditional friendship.

The new developments in our two countries' relations in recent years are very encouraging. During the 1954 Geneva Conference, our two countries worked together to restore peace in Indochina, and the delegations of the two countries had friendly contacts. At the 1955 Bandung Conference of Asian and African countries, our two countries again contributed to the promotion of international peace and friendly cooperation and to the opposition to colonialism. The Bandung Conference also made it a great honor for me to have a cordial personal contact with Prince Sihanouk. In particular, the friendly visit to China by the Royal Cambodian National Delegation headed by Prince Sihanouk in February this year created extremely favorable conditions for the further development of our two countries' friendly relations. The Chinese people warmly welcomed Prince Sihanouk, who is loved by the Cambodian people, and greatly admire this statesman who upholds international peace and cooperation. The Chinese people are pleased with the new development of friendly relations between China and Cambodia, because this not only conforms to the interests of our two countries, but also benefits the cause of peace in Asia and the world.

The friendly relations between our two countries are built on a solid foundation. Our two peoples love peace. Our two peoples cherish the independence of their own countries and urgently demand the construction of their homelands. Our two peoples resolutely oppose colonialist aggression and support all struggles to safeguard national independence. Our two peoples have established the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence – Panchasila – as the unwavering guiding principle for our two countries' relations, and unanimously maintain that these five principles should apply to relations between all countries.

Maintaining world peace and cooperating in a friendly manner with all countries in the world is China's unswerving diplomatic policy. Seven years ago, the Chinese people liberated their country and established the People's Republic of China. For seven years, we have worked diligently to restore the national economy destroyed by long-term war, carrying out the first Five-Year Plan for developing the national economy, and striving to build a socialist society. The goal of the Chinese people is to build our country from a backward agricultural country into an advanced industrial country as soon as possible. Due to the long-term disaster of colonialism, China's national economy is still very backward; it will take a considerable amount of time to build our country into an advanced industrial country. We need a peaceful international environment to carry out this peaceful labor; we need to cooperate with all countries in the world to promote our peaceful construction.

The Chinese people fully understand and completely sympathize with the Cambodian people's same desire to build their own country in a peaceful environment. The Chinese people highly respect Cambodia's policy of peace and neutrality. Cambodia's policy of peace and neutrality, which does not participate in military blocs, does not allow foreign countries to establish military bases on Cambodian territory, and is prepared to develop friendly relations with all countries, is fully in line with the Geneva Accords. The various provisions of the Geneva Accords are precisely to guarantee the sovereignty, independence, unity, and territorial integrity of the Indochinese countries, to guarantee that their internal affairs are free from any interference, and to guarantee that they have the possibility of building their own countries in a peaceful environment. All countries participating in the Geneva Conference have an obligation to abide by these provisions of the Geneva Accords. Any attempt to undermine Cambodia's policy of peace and neutrality is a violation of the Geneva Accords and is therefore unacceptable. Cambodia has set a good example in implementing the Geneva Accords. Cambodia's policy of peace and neutrality has also won the respect and support of the vast majority of people in the world and all peace-loving countries. Cambodia is playing an increasingly important role in Asian and world affairs.

The peoples of China and Cambodia have both suffered from the disaster of colonialism for a long time. The peoples of our two countries have gained the independence of their own countries through arduous struggle. We deeply know that colonialism is a fundamental source of harm to world peace. We will never allow colonial rule to be re-established on our territory, and we also firmly condemn the colonialist enslavement that is still being carried out in some countries in the world. In 1955, at the Bandung Conference, our two countries, together with other Asian and African countries, solemnly declared that colonialism in all its manifestations is an evil that should be eradicated quickly.

Here, I should mention the heroic struggle of the Egyptian people against colonialism and against aggression, which is of common concern to the peoples of our two countries. In an attempt to restore their control over the Suez Canal in Egypt, the colonialists did not hesitate to use force and brutally aggressed against Egypt. Countries and peoples who have long suffered from the disaster of colonialism cannot but strongly condemn this aggressive act of the colonialists and warmly support the Egyptian people's sacred struggle to defend national sovereignty and independence. The Chinese people greatly admire the righteous stance of the Royal Cambodian Government and people in supporting the Egyptian people in opposing colonialism and resisting aggression. Now, although the colonialists, under the strong condemnation of world opinion, have been forced to cease fire in Egypt, the aggressors are still occupying Egyptian territory. Countries and peoples who love peace and uphold justice must make greater efforts to ensure that the colonialists' aggressive troops withdraw completely from Egyptian territory and that Egypt's independence and sovereignty are restored without any form of aggression and interference. We firmly believe that the colonialist aggressors, who are morally bankrupt and completely isolated, will inevitably fail, and final victory will inevitably belong to the heroic Egyptian people.

Because our two countries have the same desire to promote international peace and cooperation and the determination to firmly maintain the independence of our own countries, it is only natural that we have established our relations on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. According to the Five Principles, countries, regardless of size, should respect each other and treat each other equally. We have always believed that any country, regardless of size, can have its own strengths, and there are things worth learning from other countries. We also believe that any country, regardless of size, can contribute to maintaining world peace and promoting international cooperation. We resolutely oppose chauvinism in any country, especially great-power chauvinism. China is determined to prevent the mistake of great-power chauvinism in its international relations and strictly abide by the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.

We are very pleased to see that since Prince Sihanouk's visit to China, the friendly relations between China and Cambodia have been strengthening day by day on the basis of the Five Principles. The Chinese people feel very honored to be able to provide some economic assistance to the Cambodian people in accordance with the economic assistance agreement signed between our two countries. Due to our limited economic strength, the assistance we can provide is insignificant, but we are very happy to have the opportunity to express our deep friendship towards the Cambodian people through this assistance. Cultural exchanges between our two countries are also developing day by day. In a few days, the Chinese football team will come to Cambodia for a friendly visit. Soon after, China also plans to send art troupes to Cambodia for visiting performances. We also hope to have the opportunity to receive various Cambodian delegations in China. If the Royal Cambodian Council and National Assembly can send delegations to visit China, we will be very welcome and feel greatly honored. We firmly believe that the friendly relations between China and Cambodia, based on the Five Principles, will continue to develop.

During his visit to China, Prince Sihanouk expressed the hope that the friendship that exists between our two peoples, as well as our peaceful coexistence and mutual respect for sovereignty, will provide an example and a way for the world to live in friendship, freedom, and peace. Let our two peoples continue to realize this lofty hope with concrete actions; let our two peoples continue to work together to maintain world peace, defend national independence, and promote international friendship and cooperation.

### 周恩来总理的讲话

1956-11-25

专栏：

    周恩来总理的讲话尊敬的柬埔寨王国会议和国民议会的议长先生们和议员先生：
    请允许我首先向你们表示谢意，感谢你们给予我向这个崇高的会议发表演说的荣誉。我把这种荣誉看作是柬埔寨人民给予中国人民的荣誉。我以中国人民的名义向你们，并且通过你们，向柬埔寨人民热烈地致意。
    虽然我和我的同事们来到你们古老而美丽的国家才只一天，但是我们已经为国王和王后陛下的接见、西哈努克亲王殿下、宾努阁下和桑云首相阁下所亲自主持的接待和柬埔寨人民的热情欢迎而深深地感动。不论我们走到什么地方，我们都看到了柬埔寨人民对中国人民真诚的友情。我们深切地感觉到，我们来到了一个亲密而友好的邻邦。
    许多世纪以来，我们两国人民一直有着密切的联系和亲密的友谊。在中国的史书中，早在公元三世纪的时候，就有关于你们的美好的国家和中柬两国人民交往的生动的记载。由于两国人民友好的交往，两国之间开展了贸易和文化的联系，丰富了我们两国经济和文化生活。柬埔寨的高僧曾经到中国翻译过经卷。柬埔寨的音乐家们也曾经在中国演奏。中国的史书中还特别提到，中柬两国人民的通商贸易进行得比较顺利。这是值得纪念的历史记载。
    近百年来，由于殖民主义侵入了亚洲，我们两国之间的友好来往曾经一度遭到了人为障碍。但是，人民之间的友谊决不是殖民主义者所能压制的。相反地，我们在反对殖民主义和维护民族独立的共同斗争中，更加加深了相互的同情和关怀。现在，中柬两国人民同亚洲地区绝大多数人民一样，已经走上了独立发展的道路，成为自己命运的主人。我们两国人民将不再容许任何力量阻挠我们两国恢复和发展传统的友谊。
    最近几年来，我们两国关系的新发展是十分令人鼓舞的。在1954年的日内瓦会议期间，我们两国曾经为恢复印度支那的和平共同作了努力，两国的代表团进行了友好的接触。在1955年亚非国家的万隆会议中，我们两国又曾经为促进国际和平和友好合作、为反对殖民主义而同样地作出了贡献。万隆会议还使我非常荣幸地获得机会同西哈努克亲王殿下进行了亲切的个人接触。特别是今年2月以西哈努克亲王殿下为首的柬埔寨王国国家代表团对中国的友好访问，为我们两国友好关系的进一步开展创造了极其有利的条件。中国人民热烈地欢迎柬埔寨人民所爱戴的西哈努克亲王殿下，并且十分敬仰这位维护国际和平和合作的政治家。中国人民为中柬两国友好关系的新发展感到高兴，因为这不仅符合于我们两国的利益，而且也有利于亚洲和世界和平事业。
    我们两国的友好关系是建立在巩固的基础上的。我们两国人民都热爱和平。我们两国人民都珍贵自己国家的独立，迫切要求进行祖国的建设。我们两国人民都坚决反对殖民主义的侵略，支持一切维护民族独立的斗争。我们两国人民已经把和平共处的五项原则——潘查希拉——确定为指导我们两国关系的坚定不移的方针，而且一致主张，这五项原则应该适用于一切国家之间的关系。
    维护世界和平、同世界各国友好合作，是中国坚守不渝的外交政策。七年以前，中国人民解放了自己的国家，建立了中华人民共和国。七年来，我们辛勤地劳动，恢复了被长期战争破坏了的国民经济，进行着发展国民经济的第一个五年计划，为建立一个社会主义的社会而努力。中国人民的目标是要尽快地把我们的国家从一个落后的农业国建设成为一个先进的工业国家。由于长期殖民主义者的灾害，中国的国民经济至今还很落后；要把我们的国家建成一个先进的工业国，还需要一个相当长的时间。我们需要一个和平的国际环境来进行这种和平的劳动；我们需要同世界各国合作来促进我们的和平建设。
    中国人民充分了解并且完全同情柬埔寨人民要求在和平的环境中建设自己的国家的同样愿望。中国人民十分尊重柬埔寨的和平中立政策。柬埔寨不参加军事集团、不允许外国在柬埔寨的领土上建立军事基地、愿意同一切国家发展友好关系的和平中立政策是完全符合于日内瓦协议的。日内瓦协议的各项规定正是为了保证印度支那各国的主权、独立、统一和领土完整，保证它们的内政不受任何干涉，保证它们有可能在和平的环境下建设自己的国家。一切参加日内瓦会议的国家都负有义务遵守日内瓦协议的这些规定。任何损害柬埔寨和平中立政策的企图都是违反日内瓦协议的，因而也是不能容许的。柬埔寨在实施日内瓦协议方面已经树立了良好的榜样。柬埔寨的和平中立政策也已经获得了世界广大人民和一切爱好和平的国家的尊重和支持。柬埔寨在亚洲和世界事务中正起着越来越重要的作用。
    中柬两国人民都曾经长期遭受到殖民主义的灾害。我们两国人民都是经过艰苦的斗争，才获得了自己国家的独立。我们深深地知道，殖民主义是危害世界和平的一个基本根源。我们决不容许殖民主义的统治重新在我们的领土上建立起来，我们也坚决谴责对世界上一些国家仍然在进行着的殖民主义奴役。1955年在万隆会议中，我们两国同其他亚非国家一起，曾经庄严地宣告：殖民主义在其一切表现中都是应该迅速予以根除的祸害。
    在这里，我应该提到我们中柬两国人民共同关心的埃及人民正在进行的反对殖民主义和反抗侵略的英勇斗争。殖民主义者为了企图恢复他们对埃及苏伊士运河的控制，不惜使用武力，横蛮地对埃及进行侵略。长期身受殖民主义灾害的国家和人民都不能不强烈谴责殖民主义者的这种侵略行为，并且热烈支持埃及人民保卫国家主权和独立的神圣斗争。中国人民十分钦佩柬埔寨王国政府和人民支持埃及人民反对殖民主义和反抗侵略的正义立场。现在，尽管殖民主义者在世界舆论的强烈谴责之下，被迫在埃及停火，但是侵略者还占领着埃及的领土，爱好和平和主持正义的国家和人民还必须作出更大的努力，使殖民主义者的侵略军队全部撤出埃及的领土，使埃及的独立和主权得到恢复而不受到任何形式的侵略和干涉。我们深信，在道义上彻底破产并且陷于完全孤立的殖民主义侵略者必然失败，最后胜利必然属于英勇的埃及人民。
    由于我们两国同样具有促进国际和平和合作的愿望和坚决维护自己国家独立的意志，因此，我们两国把相互的关系建立在和平共处的五项原则之上，这是十分自然的。根据五项原则，国家不分大小都应该互相尊重，平等对待。我们一贯认为，任何国家不论大小，都能够各有长处，都有值得其他国家学习的地方。我们也同样认为，任何国家不论大小，都能够为维护世界和平和促进国际合作作出贡献。我们坚决反对任何国家的沙文主义，特别是大国的沙文主义。中国决心在自己的国际关系中防止大国沙文主义的错误。严格遵守和平共处的五项原则。
    我们十分满意地看到，自从西哈努克亲王殿下访问中国以来，中柬两国的友好关系在五项原则的基础上一天一天地加强。中国人民感到非常荣幸，能够根据我们两国签订的经济援助协定向柬埔寨人民提供一些经济援助。由于我们的经济力量有限，我们所能提供的援助是微不足道的，但是我们很高兴有机会通过这种援助表示我们对柬埔寨人民的深厚友谊。我们两国之间的文化交流也在日益开展。几天之后，中国的足球队就要到柬埔寨来作友好访问。不久以后，中国还准备派艺术团到柬埔寨来进行访问演出。我们也希望能够有机会在中国接待柬埔寨的各种代表团。如果柬埔寨王国会议和国民议会能够派代表团到中国访问，我们将十分欢迎并且感到很大的荣幸。我们深信，以五项原则为基础的中柬两国友好关系将会得到继续不断的发展。
    西哈努克亲王殿下在访华期间曾经表示，希望我们两国人民之间存在的友谊，以及我们的和平相处和互相尊重主权，将对于使世界能在友好、自由、和平中生存提供一个榜样和办法。让我们两国人民继续以具体的行动来实现这个崇高的希望；让我们两国人民继续为维护世界和平、保卫民族独立和促进国际友好和合作而共同努力。
