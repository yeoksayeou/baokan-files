Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, November 18th: Premier Zhou Enlai arrived in Hanoi at 10:00 AM today. He was greeted with a grand welcome by over 6,000 people, including Vietnamese government leaders, representatives of the National Assembly, representatives of the armed forces, heads of various parties and organizations, foreign envoys, representatives of the International Commission from India, Poland, and Canada, representatives from all walks of life in Vietnam, and overseas Chinese.

    As Premier Zhou Enlai's plane flew over Gia Lam Airport, cheers erupted from the crowd, and bouquets of flowers and countless Chinese and Vietnamese national flags waved towards the plane in the sky until it landed on the airport.

    Premier Pham Van Dong and Deputy Premiers Phan Ke Toai and Vo Nguyen Giap stepped forward amidst the welcoming music to shake hands with Premier Zhou Enlai and Deputy Premier He Long as they disembarked the plane. At the same time, a group of innocent and lively Vietnamese Young Pioneers ran up to present flowers to Premier Zhou Enlai, Deputy Premier He Long, and others. After the military band played the national anthems of China and Vietnam, Premier Zhou Enlai and Deputy Premier He Long reviewed the guard of honor.

    Then, Premier Zhou Enlai shook hands with the leaders of various Vietnamese departments who came to greet him. Among them were Ton Duc Thang, Chairman of the National Assembly of Vietnam and Chairman of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Fatherland Front, Ton Quang Phiet, Vice Chairman of the National Assembly, Truong Chinh, Secretary-General of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Workers' Party, ministers and deputy ministers of various government departments, Hoang Quoc Viet, Chairman of the Vietnam General Confederation of Labor, Van Tien Dung, Chief of General Staff of the Vietnam People's Army, and Bui Ky, Chairman of the Vietnam-China Friendship Association.

    When Premier Zhou Enlai walked to the front of the welcoming line of representatives from all walks of life, the crowd cheered enthusiastically again, and bouquets of flowers were handed to Premier Zhou Enlai. Representatives of the Indian overseas community in Vietnam also presented Premier Zhou Enlai with a lei.

    After meeting with the welcomers, Premier Pham Van Dong delivered a welcome speech at the airport.

    Premier Pham Van Dong said, "On behalf of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Vietnamese people, I welcome Premier Zhou Enlai and others to visit Vietnam with unparalleled excitement and joy. Since ancient times, the people of Vietnam and China have had a deep friendship. Since the people of both countries became masters of their own countries, this friendship has developed further, and the relations between the two countries have become increasingly close. Because in the camp of socialist and people's democratic countries, this friendship and relationship are based on the principles of complete equality, mutual assistance, and brotherly cooperation.

    Last June, the delegation of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, led by President Ho Chi Minh, was warmly received by the Chinese government and the Chinese people during their visit to China, which further strengthened the brotherly solidarity between the two countries. I believe that this visit of Premier Zhou Enlai to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam will further strengthen the relationship between the people of the two countries and make a significant contribution to safeguarding peace in Asia and the world."

    Then, Premier Zhou Enlai delivered a reply speech.

    Premier Zhou Enlai said, "We are very pleased and excited to visit our brotherly country, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, at your invitation. Please allow me to convey to you, to the great and heroic Vietnamese people, the warmest respect and the most cordial greetings from the Chinese people. The people of China and Vietnam have an unbreakable, brotherly, and profound friendship. We have not only been close neighbors since ancient times, but also brothers in adversity in recent centuries. We have always deeply sympathized with and supported each other in our respective struggles for national independence and people's democracy. We have always stood closely together and worked together in the cause of safeguarding peace in Asia and the world. The glorious victory achieved by the Vietnamese people in their heroic struggle against colonialism has greatly inspired the Chinese people. The great achievements made by the Vietnamese people in safeguarding peace in Indochina have made the Chinese people very excited. Today, the closely united people of China and Vietnam, together with the great Soviet Union and other socialist countries, as well as all peace-loving countries and people, have formed an invincible force for safeguarding peace. Although the imperialists are desperately creating international tensions, carrying out colonialist aggression, and even妄想(wang xiang) attempting to subvert socialist countries, they are doomed to failure. The cause of justice will surely win! Finally, please allow me to express my heartfelt thanks for your friendly, warm, and grand welcome. May the eternal friendship between the people of China and Vietnam last forever!"

    Subsequently, Premier Zhou Enlai, accompanied by Premier Pham Van Dong, traveled to the Presidential Palace by car. Tens of thousands of citizens gathered along the streets, applauding and cheering to the Chinese guests.

    President Ho Chi Minh personally greeted Premier Zhou Enlai and Deputy Premier He Long on the steps of the Presidential Palace. At this time, many people gathered outside the Presidential Palace enthusiastically cheered President Ho Chi Minh and Premier Zhou Enlai. President Ho Chi Minh and Premier Zhou Enlai frequently waved to them. Then, Premier Zhou Enlai and President Ho Chi Minh had a short conversation in the hall of the Presidential Palace. Subsequently, Premier Zhou Enlai and his entourage rested at the Presidential Palace.

    Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, November 18th: Premier of the State Council Zhou Enlai, Deputy Premier He Long, and their entourage, left Nanning by special plane at 9:50 this morning to visit the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

    Hoang Van Hoan, Ambassador of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to China, and Duong Anh, head of the Cambodian economic delegation, traveled on the same plane.

    Premier Zhou Enlai and his entourage arrived in Nanning yesterday afternoon.

    周恩来总理到达河内受到热烈欢迎
    新华社河内18日电　周恩来总理在今天上午十点到达河内。他受到越南政府领袖、国会的代表、军队的代表、各党派团体负责人、各国使节和国际委员会的印度、波兰、加拿大的代表、越南各界人民代表和华侨等六千多人的盛大欢迎。
    当周恩来乘坐的飞机飞到嘉林机场上空的时候，机场上的人群欢声雷动，一束束鲜花和无数面中、越国旗向着天空的飞机挥动，直到飞机在机场上停落。
    范文同总理和潘继遂、武元甲副总理在迎宾曲声中上前同走下飞机的周恩来总理和贺龙副总理等握手。同时，一群天真活泼的越南少年先锋队队员跑上前来向周恩来总理、贺龙副总理等献花。在军乐队演奏了中、越两国国歌之后，周恩来总理和贺龙副总理检阅了仪仗队。
    接着，周恩来总理同前来迎接的越南各部门领导人一一握手。他们中间有，越南国民大会主席、越南祖国战线中央委员会主席孙德胜，国民大会副主席孙光阀，越南劳动党书记处书记长征，政府各部部长和副部长，越南总工会主席黄国越，越南人民军总参谋长文进勇、越中友好协会主席裴纪等。
    当周恩来总理走到各界人民代表的欢迎行列前面的时候，群众队伍再度响起了热烈的欢呼，一束束的鲜花递到了周恩来总理的手里。印度旅越侨民代表还给周恩来总理戴上了花环。
    在同欢迎者见面完毕以后，范文同总理在机场上致欢迎词。
    范文同总理说，我代表越南民主共和国政府和越南人民以无比兴奋和愉快的心情欢迎周恩来总理等访问越南。自古以来，越中两国人民就有着深厚的友谊。自从两国人民当了自己国家的主人，这种友谊更得到发展，两国的关系也日益密切。因为在社会主义和人民民主国家的阵营中，这种友谊和关系是基于完全平等、互助和兄弟合作的原则。
    去年6月，以胡志明主席为首的越南民主共和国政府代表团访问中国期间，受到中国政府和中国人民殷勤的接待，进一步加强了两国兄弟般的团结。我相信这一次周恩来总理访问越南民主共和国，将进一步密切两国人民的关系，为保卫亚洲和世界和平做出重大的贡献。
    接着周恩来总理致答词。
    周恩来总理说，我们以十分愉快和兴奋的心情应邀访问我们的兄弟之邦——越南民主共和国。请允许我向你们，向伟大的、英雄的越南人民，转达中国人民的最热烈的敬意和最亲切的问候。中越两国人民之间有着牢不可破的、兄弟般的深厚友谊。我们不仅自古以来就是亲密的邻邦，而且在近世纪以来更是患难中的兄弟。我们在各自争取民族独立和人民民主的斗争中一向深切的相互同情和相互支持。我们在维护亚洲和世界的和平的事业中一向紧密地站在一起，共同努力。越南人民在坚持反抗殖民主义的英勇斗争中所取得的辉煌胜利给了中国人民很大的鼓舞。越南人民在保障印度支那和平的事业中所取得的巨大成就使中国人民感到十分兴奋。今天，亲密团结的中越两国人民同伟大的苏联和其他社会主义国家以及一切爱好和平的国家和人民一起，已经形成一支不可战胜的保卫和平的力量。尽管帝国主义者拚命制造国际紧张局势，进行殖民主义的侵略，甚至于妄想颠复社会主义国家，但是他们是注定要失败的。正义的事业一定会赢得胜利！最后，请允许我对你们这样友好、热烈、盛大的欢迎，表示衷心的感谢。中越两国人民永恒的友谊万岁！
