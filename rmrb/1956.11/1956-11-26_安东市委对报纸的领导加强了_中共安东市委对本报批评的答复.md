The An Dong Municipal Party Committee Strengthens Leadership over the Newspaper
    -- Reply from the CPC An Dong Municipal Committee to the Newspaper's Criticism

    Editor's Note: After the publication of the article "The Misfortunes of Critical Articles in An Dong," the CPC An Dong Municipal Committee made a responsible examination of its shortcomings and errors in leading the newspaper's work, and carefully verified the facts in the critical articles. It also took concrete measures to improve its leadership over the newspaper and help the newspaper improve its work. This is the right approach. After the publication of this critical article, due to responses disagreeing with certain facts, this newspaper sent a special person to An Dong to investigate. The investigation results proved that some facts in this critical article were indeed inaccurate. Now, the summary of the reply from the CPC An Dong Municipal Committee is as follows:

    The article "The Misfortunes of Critical Articles in An Dong" published in the People's Daily on August 16th prompted us to focus on examining the Municipal Party Committee's leadership over the entire newspaper's work.

    After examination, we believe that the Municipal Party Committee does have some shortcomings in leading the newspaper's work. For example, the understanding of the role of the newspaper is insufficient, the political and ideological leadership of the newspaper is relatively weak, the guidance for the newspaper to carry out criticism is not specific enough, and sometimes articles are inappropriately withdrawn. These shortcomings inevitably affect the development of criticism and self-criticism in the newspaper to a certain extent.

    Regarding some of the facts listed in this critical article, we have some explanations and opinions:

    Regarding the article criticizing Comrade Xu Jingyi, Deputy Manager of the Coal Construction Company, we believe that it was not necessary to withdraw the article at that time. Comrade Zhang Yunjie, the former Secretary-General of the Municipal Party Committee, told the newspaper to withdraw the article with the intention of: some leading cadres in the city also had problems with receiving subsidies, which had not yet been dealt with. At this time, criticizing lower-level cadres in the newspaper might make people unconvinced. Considering that the Municipal Party Committee Secretary was not at home at that time, it was planned to study and publish it after the Secretary returned. At the same time, it should be especially noted that the nature of their mistakes was accepting unreasonable subsidies, not defrauding subsidies.

    Regarding the article criticizing the Municipal Women's Federation, Comrade Han Bo of the Municipal Party Committee Propaganda Department heard from the comrades of the Municipal Women's Federation that the criticism was inaccurate and asked the newspaper to withdraw the article. Later, he did not inquire about it again. Comrade Han Bo is responsible for this. As for the criticized facts themselves, our investigation shows that they do not exist. This is a misunderstanding. In addition, Comrade Yu Fang of the Municipal Women's Federation did not cry loudly when looking for Comrade Han Bo.

    Regarding the critical article about the silk spinning factory, the Municipal Party Committee's responsibility is that it was delayed for several months, affecting the timing of publication. However, it was later publicly published. However, Comrade Yingying's article did not explain that it was still published later. (Editor's note: Comrade Yingying did make a statement in his original manuscript, but we deleted it during the editing process).

    The Municipal Party Committee has made an inspection report to all comrades of the newspaper's editorial department, reviewed the shortcomings in leading the newspaper's work, and asked the newspaper to combine inspection work, also put forward opinions to the leadership, and propose specific methods to improve the newspaper's work. Then, the Municipal Party Committee will conduct a comprehensive and systematic study of the newspaper's work and make a decision on the Municipal Party Committee to strengthen specific leadership over the newspaper.

### 安东市委对报纸的领导加强了——中共安东市委对本报批评的答复

    安东市委对报纸的领导加强了
    ——中共安东市委对本报批评的答复
    编者按　“批评稿件在安东的厄运”一文发表以后，中共安东市委对自己在领导报纸工作中的缺点和错误作了负责的检查，并对批评稿件中的事实作了认真的核对，同时还采取具体措施改进对报纸的领导和帮助报纸改进工作，这样作是很对的。这一批评稿件刊出以后，由于收到不同意其中某些事实的反映，本报曾派专人去安东作了调查，调查结果证明，这一批评稿件中的某些事实确有出入。现在把中共安东市委的答复摘要如下：
    8月16日人民日报登载的“批评稿件在安东的厄运”一文，推动我们着重地检查了市委对整个报纸工作的领导。
    经过检查，我们认为市委在领导报纸工作上，确实存在着一些缺点。比如对报纸的作用认识不足，对报纸的政治思想领导比较薄弱，对报纸开展批评的指导不够具体，有时抽稿不当。这些缺点不能不在一定程度上影响到报纸上的批评与自我批评的开展。
    关于这篇批评稿件中列举的一些事实，我们有些说明和意见：
    关于批评煤建公司副经理徐经一同志的稿件，我们认为当时是没有必要抽稿的。前市委秘书长张云杰同志告诉报社抽稿的本意是：市里有的领导干部在享受补助上也有问题，尚未进行处理，这时在报纸上批评下级干部，恐使人不服，又考虑到当时市委书记不在家，拟待书记回来后再研究发表。同时，应该特别说明：他们的错误性质都是接受不合理的补助，而不是骗取补助。
   关于批评市妇联的稿件，市委宣传部韩波同志当时听市妇联的同志说批评失实，叫报社抽稿，后来没有再加过问，在这点上韩波同志是有责任的。至于被批评的事实本身，经我们调查是不存在的，这是一种误会。此外，市妇联于方同志在找韩波同志时，也没有大哭大喊。
    关于对绢纺工厂的批评稿件，市委的责任是压了几个月，影响了发表的时机。但是后来还是公开发表了。而英英同志的文章中却没有说明以后还是发表了这一点。（编者注：英英同志在他的原稿中是作了说明的，是我们在编辑过程中删掉的）。
    市委已向报社编辑部全体同志作了检查报告，检讨了领导报纸工作中的缺点，并且要报纸结合检查工作，也向领导上提意见，提出改进报纸工作的具体办法，然后，市委将对报纸工作进行全面系统的研究，作出市委加强对报纸具体领导的决定。
