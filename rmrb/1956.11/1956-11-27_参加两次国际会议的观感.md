Observations on Attending Two International Conferences
    Feng Youlan
    In September and October, I attended two international cultural conferences. One was held in Geneva, Switzerland. The literal translation of its name is "International Get-Together Meeting." We now translate it as "International Encounter." This meeting is organized by the citizens of Geneva. It is held annually, inviting several people to give lectures, followed by discussions. This year marked the eleventh meeting.
    The other conference was held in Venice, Italy. The literal translation of its name is "European Association for Culture," which was initiated by some participants during the first "International Encounter." It is primarily composed of members. Most members are well-known figures in the cultural and academic circles of various countries. The meeting place is located in Venice.
    The purpose of both conferences is to bring together people with diverse opinions to discuss important issues related to culture or life, with the aim of enhancing international mutual understanding. This year's "Encounter" was attended by over eighty people from twenty-two countries. The "European Association" was attended by over one hundred people from twenty countries. It was originally a "European Association," but this time we were invited to participate as observers.
    The "International Encounter" has a central theme each year. The themes for each meeting since 1946 have been:
    1946　The Spirit of Europe;
    1947　The Progress of Technology and the Progress of Morality;
    1948　Debate on Modern Art;
    1949　For a New Humanism;
    1950　The Rights of the Spirit and the Urgent Demands of Society;
    1951　The Twentieth Century's Understanding of Man;
    1952　Man in the Face of Science;
    1953　Modern Anguish and the Task of the Spirit;
    1954　The New World and Europe;
    1955　Is Culture in Danger?
    1956　Tradition and Innovation.
    The "European Association" publishes a journal called "Understanding." The inaugural issue was published in 1950. Each issue also has a central theme.
    First Issue　The Universality of Culture;
    Second Issue　Culture and the Atomic Bomb;
    Third Issue　Culture and the Iron Curtain;
    Fourth Issue　The Crisis of Art;
    Fifth and Sixth Issues　The Threat of Refusing to Talk to Culture;
    Seventh and Eighth Issues　Cultural Policy;
    Ninth Issue　The Reality of Europe;
    Tenth and Eleventh Issues　Power and Culture: The New Continent;
    Twelfth Issue　Soviet Power, Communism, and Culture;
    Thirteenth and Fourteenth Issues　The British Empire; The Problem of Civilization;
    Fifteenth Issue　Humanism Today.
    These topics were certainly not planned and arranged in advance from the beginning. However, when these topics are linked together, they do reflect a trend of thought in capitalist countries, demonstrating some of the problems in their thinking.
    This year's "International Encounter" was held from September 5th to 15th, lasting for ten days. With "Tradition and Innovation" as the central theme, seven lectures were organized, along with seven discussion sessions to discuss each lecture. Both the lectures and discussions had audiences, numbering up to more than a thousand people.
    The lecture topics for this meeting were:
    (1) Christianity: Nothing New, Nothing Old;
    (2) Lessons from a Crisis in Ancient Traditions;
    (3) The Cultural Heritage of the Mediterranean;
    (4) Humanism;
    (5) Islamic Tradition in the Face of the Modern World;
    (6) Three Excellent Traditions in Chinese Culture;
    (7) Prospero and Caliban (two characters in Shakespeare's play).
    I was the main speaker for the sixth topic.
    The European Cultural Association's conference this year featured five reports with the following topics:
    (1) Activities of the Association;
    (2) The Importance of Culture in the Current Stage of History;
    (3) The Role of Cultural Figures in the Renaissance;
    (4) The Importance of Culture in the Evolution of Colonial Countries;
    (5) Some Aspects of Soviet Culture. The last topic was presented by Ehrenburg.
    In both the "International Encounter" and the "European Association," the issue of the so-called "cultural crisis" was mentioned. This "culture" of course refers to the so-called "European culture" or "Western culture," which is also the "European spirit" that the "International Encounter" proposed as the central topic for discussion in 1946, and is capitalist culture.
    In terms of European tradition, the "European spirit" mainly consists of modern science and Christianity. These are the new and old components of capitalist culture. They were originally opposing forces. The power of science has been increasing, and the spirit of religion has been declining; this is the inevitable law of social development. However, many people in capitalist countries do not see it this way. They regard the power of science and technology as a material force, and religion as a spiritual and moral force, seeing the progress of science and technology as a threat to the spirit and morality. Therefore, topics such as "The Progress of Technology and the Progress of Morality," "The Rights of the Spirit and the Urgent Demands of Society," and "Man in the Face of Science" are brought up. This is one aspect of the "crisis." This aspect is clearly expressed in the issues raised by the "International Encounter."
    The other aspect of the "crisis" is related to the current social reality. This aspect is clearly expressed in the issues raised in the "European Association's" journal "Understanding." For example, the issues it raised, such as "Culture and the Atomic Bomb," "Culture and the Iron Curtain," "The Reality of Europe," and "Communism and Culture," all illustrate this point. This aspect of the "crisis" is actually the threat that capitalist culture feels due to the progress of socialist culture.
    Thus, the question arises: "Is Culture in Danger?" People who feel these problems have also proposed solutions to deal with the so-called "crisis," which is to use the so-called "New Humanism" and "Humanism Today." "The understanding of man" should be a major component of humanism. The topics of the "International Encounter" in 1949 and 1951, and the fifteenth issue of the "European Association's" "Understanding," all reflect this idea. Unfortunately, we did not participate in either of these meetings. I have also not yet read the published collections of lectures and "Understanding," so I do not know what the content is. Humanism was also a lecture topic at this year's conference, and it was frequently mentioned in discussions. However, what humanism actually is was not clearly explained.
    The "crisis" of capitalist culture has some concrete examples. The main contradiction in Chinese society is the contradiction between progressive relations of production and backward productive forces. In capitalist countries, the main contradiction is the opposite: the contradiction between backward relations of production and advanced productive forces. When I was in Geneva, there was a discussion in the British newspapers about industrial automation. The focus of the discussion was the issue of worker unemployment after industrial automation. If a factory that originally employed a thousand people only needs a hundred people after automation, what happens to the remaining nine hundred? In socialist countries, industrial automation means workers reduce their working hours. In capitalist countries, industrial automation means worker unemployment. After much discussion, there was no good solution. Later, an engineer came out and said: there is no need to panic for the time being, because as far as he knows, automation will not appear all at once. Problems like these are related to the crisis of capitalist culture.
    However, such specifics were not discussed at the conference. Some people still hope to rely on the spirit of Christianity to salvage the crisis. At this year's "International Encounter" conference, the lecture "Christianity: Nothing New, Nothing Old" advocated this idea. The professor who gave this lecture believed that the Christian church has new and old aspects, but the spirit of Christianity is neither new nor old. There are good and bad believers in the church, but the spirit of Christianity is always good. In the meeting, there were also lectures focusing on discussing past cultures. One speaker believed that culture is divided into continental and oceanic types, the former emphasizing social sanctions and the latter emphasizing individual freedom. Another speaker divided culture into Eastern and Western types, the former emphasizing "eternity" and the latter emphasizing "change." At the "European Association" meeting, one speaker believed that cultural development has two conditions: one is autonomy (independence from politics), and the other is creation. Because culture is creative, its future is also unpredictable.
    My lecture pointed out three excellent traditions in Chinese culture. The first is the tradition of peace, the second is the tradition of democracy, and the third is the tradition of science. The lecture used examples from the history of Chinese philosophy to illustrate these three traditions, and pointed out that New China's policy of peace, democratic system, the struggle between materialism and idealism, and scientific research are all continuations and developments of these three traditions.
    The central theme of this conference was "Tradition and Innovation," and my lecture and discussions focused more on the aspect of innovation. As will be mentioned below, The Times of London's September 22nd dispatch stated that China was the main promoter of innovation at this conference.
    In general, the lectures and discussions at both conferences generally talked more about the past and less about the future, and quoted more from classics and less about connecting with reality.
    The people attending these two conferences were mainly writers and professors in various fields of social science. There were also a few philosophy professors among them, and in individual conversations, they also talked about the situation in the philosophical circles of capitalist countries. According to preliminary understanding, the situation in the philosophical circles of capitalist countries is similar to that of 1949. Roughly speaking: in the United States, pragmatism is outdated, and logical positivism is also declining (as stated by an American philosophy professor, Marx). However, there is no emerging system. The topics that philosophers discuss are relatively small. In Europe, the most influential philosophical thought is still existentialism, and psychoanalysis also still has influence in the United States and Europe.
    In Geneva, I was invited to participate in a television program. This was in the form of a panel discussion, with six people participating, each speaking for five minutes. My speech was in response to a question raised by a French professor. The question was: "It is generally believed that since China has had a fundamental revolution in social and economic aspects, it does not want any of its old culture. What do you think?" I replied that New China has had a fundamental revolution in social and economic aspects, but it does not mean that it has abandoned all old traditions. We first analyze the old culture, discard the useless parts, and not only do we not discard the useful parts, the parts that are loved by the people, but we also promote and develop them. I also talked about our policies of "letting a hundred flowers bloom" and "letting a hundred schools of thought contend."
    Generally speaking, intellectuals in capitalist countries have two extreme views on New China. One is that China completely follows the Soviet Union, discards all of its old culture, and that Marxism is forced upon the Chinese people by the Communist Party. The question raised in the television program mentioned above represents this view. At the Venice meeting, a professor told me that both capitalism and socialism were imported into China from Europe and contradict Chinese tradition. A British Member of Parliament who had just returned from China published a letter in The Times of London, roughly saying that, judging from the speed of China's construction, it would soon become the world's leading power, and the United States would become a dwarf compared to China. But it is a tragedy that China, a country with excellent culture and clever people, would have taken the bait of Marxism.
    The other view is that China is different from the Soviet Union, and China is taking a different path. An article in The Times of London discussed the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, saying that: Chinese communism is peasant communism, while Soviet communism is worker communism; Soviet communism is orthodox Marxism, while China is not. Some people also believe that China is different from the Soviet Union because China's traditional culture is different from that of the Soviet Union. According to this view, New China is not abandoning traditional culture, but is precisely influenced by traditional culture.
    Both of these views are wrong, but they both have their epistemological roots. Our revolutionary theory and practice are originally the combination of the universal truth of Marxism and the reality of China. However, for people who have not personally experienced the Chinese revolution, it is difficult to understand this combination. They often only see one side of things, exaggerate it, and absolutize it, which becomes the two extreme views mentioned above.
    Some of the people who hold this view are well-intentioned towards China. Some of them truly cherish Chinese cultural traditions and are very concerned about its demise. Some of them also truly praise the success of the Chinese revolution, and therefore exaggerate its characteristics excessively. All these people should be considered friends of China, and it is our responsibility to help them have a correct understanding of the Chinese revolution.
    This point is also in line with the purpose of these two conferences, which is to enable all countries in the world to correctly understand each other.
    The Times of London published a special dispatch on September 22nd, giving a fairly detailed report on this year's "International Encounter" conference. The title of this dispatch was: "Good Talk in Geneva - Peaceful Atmosphere of Different Opinions on the Lakeside." The reporter said: In this meeting, Marxists, religious believers, and agnostics sat quietly together. He said: This kind of polite attitude has been the case for many years. He said that a tradition of mutual respect is gradually being established. The participants bring this tradition back to their homes in all corners of the world, which will also play a role in daily life.
    According to a University of Geneva professor who has participated in the "International Encounter" for many years, one of the characteristics of this year's meeting is that the atmosphere in the meeting was particularly harmonious. This is proof that the tradition of mutual respect is gradually being established.
    Ehrenburg said in his speech at the "European Association" that the Soviet Union wants to strengthen ties with Western countries. He said: In the political sphere, countries with different social systems coexist peacefully. In the cultural sphere, countries with different social systems should also create together.
    This is the road to world peace today.

    参加两次国际会议的观感
    冯友兰
    我在9、10月间，参加了两个国际性的文化会议。一个会在瑞士的日内瓦举行。它底名字，按字面翻，叫“国际碰头会”。我们现在翻为“国际会晤”。这个会是日内瓦的公民举办的。每年开会一次，请几个人作讲演，讲演后讨论。今年开的是第十一次会。
    另一个会在意大利的威尼斯举行。它底名字，按字面翻，叫“关于文化的欧洲协会”，是在第一次“国际会晤”中有些人发起组织的。它是以会员为主体。会员大部分是各国文化界学术界的知名人士。会址设在威尼斯。
    这两个会的目的，都是聚集许多不同意见的人，在一起讨论一些与文化或生活有关的重要问题。以期增进国际间的互相谅解。这次的“会晤”参加的有二十二个国家，八十余人。“欧洲协会”参加的有二十个国家，一百多人。它本来是“欧洲协会”，这次请我们以观察员的资格参加。
    “国际会晤”，每年有一个中心题目，今年为第十一次大会。从1946年来，每次会的中心题目是：
    1946　欧洲精神；
    1947　技术的进步和道德的进步；
    1948　关于现代艺术的辩论；
    1949　为了新的人本主义；
    1950　精神的权利和社会的迫切要求；
    1951　二十世纪对于人的认识；
    1952　在科学面前的人；
    1953　现代的苦闷和精神的任务；
    1954　新世界与欧洲；
    1955　文化在危险中吗？
    1956　传统与革新。
    “欧洲协会”出了一个刊物名“了解”。1950年出创刊号。每期也有个中心题目。
    第一期　文化的普遍性；
    第二期　文化与原子弹；
    第三期　文化与铁幕；
    第四期　艺术的危机；
    第五、六期　拒绝会谈对于文化的威胁；
    第七、八期　文化政策；
    第九期　欧洲的现实；
    第十、十一期　强权与文化：新的大陆；
    第十二期　苏维埃权力，共产主义与文化；
    第十三、十四期　大英帝国；文明的问题；
    第十五期　今日的人本主义。
    这些题目，当然不是一开始就有计划预先排定的。但是，这些题目联系起来，确反映资本主义国家的一种思想趋势，表现他们思想中的一些问题。
    “国际会晤”本年的会从9月5日起至15日止，开会十天。以“传统与革新”为中心题目，组织了七个讲演，还有七个讨论会，对于各个讲演进行讨论。讲演会和讨论会都有听众，多至一千多人。
    这次会的讲演题目是：
    （1）基督教无新无旧；
    （2）古代传统中的一个危机的教训；
    （3）地中海的文化遗产；
    （4）人本主义；
    （5）在现在世界面前的回教传统；
    （6）中国文化中的三个优良传统；
    （7）Prospero和Caliban（莎士比亚剧中的两个人名）其中第六个题目是由我主讲的。
    欧洲文化协会今年的大会，有五个报告，报告题目是：
    （1）本会的活动；
    （2）在历史现阶段中文化的重要性；
    （3）文艺复兴时期文化人所担任的角色；
    （4）在殖民地国家的演化中，文化的重要性；
    （5）苏联文化的某些方面。最后的一个题目是爱伦堡主讲的。
    在“国际会晤”和“欧洲协会”中，都提到所谓“文化危机”的问题。这个“文化”当然是指所谓“欧洲文化”或“西方文化”，也就是“国际会晤”在1946年所提出作为讨论的中心题目的“欧洲精神”，也就是资本主义文化。
    就欧洲的传统说，“欧洲精神”主要的是近代科学和基督教。这是资本主义文化中的新的和旧的两种成分。它们本来是对立的。科学的力量日益增长，宗教的精神日益衰颓；这是社会发展的必然规律。可是资本主义国家中还有很多的人的看法，不是这样。他们把科学和技术的力量看成是物质方面的力量，把宗教看成是精神的、道德的力量，把科技的进步看成是对于精神和道德的威胁。因此，就有像“技术的进步和道德的进步”、“精神的权利和社会的迫切要求”，“在科学面前的人”等题目提出来。这是“危机”的一方面。这一方面，在“国际会晤”所提出的问题中，有很清楚的表现。
    “危机”的另一方面，是与当前的社会现实有关系的。这一方面，在“欧洲协会”的刊物“了解”所提的问题中，有很清楚的表现。例如它所提出的“文化与原子弹”、“文化与铁幕”、“欧洲的现实”、“共产主义与文化”等问题，都说明这一点。“危机”的这一方面，其实就是因为社会主义文化的进展，资本主义文化所感觉到的威胁。
    于是就有“文化在危险中吗？”的问题。感觉到有这些问题的人，也提出了应付所谓“危机”的办法，就是要用所谓“新的人本主义”、“今天的人本主义”。“对于人的认识”应该是人本主义的一个主要组成部分。“国际会晤”1949年和1951年的题目，“欧洲协会”的“了解”第十五期的题目都反映出他们的这个思想。可惜这两次会，我们都没有参加。后来出的讲演集和“了解”也还没有看过。不知有些什么内容。今年会议中人本主义也是一个讲演题目，在讨论会中，也经常有人提到人本主义。可是人本主义究竟是什么，还是没有讲清楚。
    资本主义文化的“危机”，是有些具体的例证。中国社会中现有的主要矛盾是进步的生产关系和落后的生产力的矛盾。资本主义国家中，现有的主要矛盾正是相反，是落后的生产关系和先进的生产力的矛盾。我在日内瓦的时候，英国的报纸上，有关于工业自动化的讨论。讨论的集中点在于工业自动化后工人失业的问题。如果原来用一千人的工厂，自动化后只有一百人，其余的九百人怎么办？在社会主义国家中，工业自动化等于工人减少工作时间，在资本主义国家中，工业自动化等于工人失业。讨论来，讨论去，没有好的解决办法。后来有个工程师出来说：暂时不必恐慌，因为据他所知，自动化不是一下子就能出现的。像这一类的问题，正是与资本主义文化危机有关系的。
    可是，在会议中，并没有谈到这样的具体。有人还希望依靠基督教的精神，挽救危机。在“国际会晤”的这次会议中，“基督教无新无旧”这个讲演就是这样的主张。作这个讲演的教授认为基督教的教会有新有旧，但基督教的精神是无新无旧的。教会中的教徒，有好有坏，但基督教的精神总是好的。在会中也有讲演注重论述过去的文化。一位讲演者认为文化分为大陆的和海洋的两种，前者注重社会制裁，后者注重个人自由。另一位讲演者把文化分为东方的和西方的，前者注重“永恒”，后者注重“变化”。在“欧洲协会”的会中，有一位讲演者认为文化发展有两个条件，一个是自主（独立于政治），一个是创造。因为文化是创造的，所以将来也不可预测。
    我的讲演指出中国文化中的三种优良传统。第一是和平的传统，第二是民主的传统，第三是科学的传统。讲演中用中国哲学史中的例证，说明这三种传统，并指出新中国的和平政策，民主制度，唯物主义与唯心主义的斗争，和科学研究，都是这三种传统的继续和发展。
    这次会议的中心题目，是“传统与革新”，我的讲演和讨论会，是在革新方面谈得比较多的。下面将要提到的伦敦时报9月22日的通讯，说在这次会议中，中国是革新的主要宣传者。
    总起来说，在两个会的讲演和讨论会中，一般说来，谈过去的多，谈将来的少。引经据典的多，结合实际的少。
    这两次会议，到会的人主要的是文艺作家和社会科学各方面的教授。其中也有少数的哲学教授，在个别谈话中，也谈到资本主义国家中哲学界的一些情况。据初步了解，资本主义国家的哲学界的情况，和1949年差不多。大致是：在美国实用主义过时了，逻辑实证主义也走下坡路了（美国的一位哲学教授马克恩这样说的）。可是并没有新兴的系统。哲学家所讨论的都是比较小的问题。在欧洲最有影响的哲学思想，还是存在主义，心理分析在美国和欧洲也都还有影响。
    在日内瓦我被邀参加了一个电视节目。这是作为一种座谈会的形式，有六个人参加，每人发言五分钟。我的发言是回答一个法国教授所提出的问题。问题是：“一般人认为中国既然有一个在社会经济方面的根本革命，对于旧文化一概都不要了。你以为如何？”我回答说，新中国是在社会和经济方面有根本的革命，但并不是把旧传统一概都不要了。我们对于旧文化是首先加以分析，抛弃其中无用的部分，其中有用的部分，为人民所喜爱的部分，则不但不抛弃，并且加以发扬光大。同时也讲了我们的“百花齐放”和“百家争鸣”的政策。
    大概资本主义国家中的知识分子对于新中国的看法，有两种极端，一种是认为中国完全跟着苏联走，把旧日文化一概不要了，马克思主义是共产党强迫加在中国人民身上的。上边所说电视节目中所提的问题，就代表这一种意见。在威尼斯的会中，有位教授，同我谈话，认为资本主义和社会主义都是从欧洲输入中国，而跟中国的传统相违反的。有一个英国议员刚从中国回去，在伦敦时报上发表了一封信，大意说，照中国建设的速度看起来，不久要成为世界第一强国，美国跟中国比起来，要成为矮子。但是中国这样一个有优良文化和灵巧的人民，竟然会上了马克思主义的钩子，这是一个悲剧。
    另外一种看法是：中国与苏联不同，中国走的是另外一条路。伦敦时报有一篇文章论中国共产党的八次代表大会，说：中国的共产主义是农民共产主义，苏联是工人共产主义；苏联的共产主义是正统的马克思主义，中国不是。也有人认为中国与苏联不同，是由于中国的传统文化与苏联不同。照这种意见，新中国并不是不要传统文化，而正是受了传统文化的影响。
    这两种看法都是错误的，可是也都有其认识论的根源。我们的革命的理论和实践本来都是马克思主义的普遍真理和中国实际的结合。可是，对于中国革命没有亲身体验的人，对于这个结合是很难理解的。他们往往只看见事情的一面，把它夸大起来，绝对化起来，就成为上面所说的两个极端的看法。
    持这种看法的人，有些对于中国也是善意的。他们有些确是爱护中国的文化传统，很耽心它的灭亡。有些也确是赞美中国革命的成功，因此把它的特点过分地夸张起来。这些人都应该认为是中国的朋友，怎样使他们对于中国革命有正确的认识，这是我们的责任。
    这一点也是跟这两个会的目的相符合，这两个会的目的，就是使世界上的各国正确地互相认识。
    伦敦时报9月22日发表了一个特约通讯，对于“国际会晤”的这次会议，作了一个相当详尽的报道。这篇通讯的题目是：“在日内瓦的好谈话——湖边上的不同意见的和平气氛”。这位记者说：在这次会里，马克思主义者和宗教的信徒及不可知论者安静地坐在一起。他说：这种客气的态度历年来都是如此。他说一个互相尊重的传统逐渐建立起来。参加会的人把这个传统带回他们的在世界各角落的家里，这对于日常生活也会起作用的。
    据历年参加“国际会晤”的一位日内瓦大学教授说：今年的会议的一个特点，就是会中的空气特别和谐。这就是互相尊重的传统，逐渐建立起来的证明。
    爱伦堡在“欧洲协会”的讲演里，说苏联要加强对于西方国家的联系。他说：在政治方面，不同社会制度的国家和平共处。在文化方面，不同社会制度的国家还要共同创造。
    这是今天走向世界和平的大路。
