Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 17th—Another batch of Tibetan agricultural and pastoral products, as well as local specialties, which will be exhibited at the National Agricultural Exhibition, are being transported from Lhasa to Beijing. These exhibits include more than one hundred varieties of field crops and horticultural crops, as well as dozens of well-known medicinal materials produced on the plateau.

These agricultural products are mainly a small portion of the thousands of varieties introduced by agricultural workers in Tibet over the past few years, all of which are suitable for cultivation on the plateau. Trial planting of Soviet winter rye on the plateau resulted in a yield of one thousand catties per mu. Wu Gong No. 17 and Nan Da No. 2419 spring wheat also yielded more than twice as much as local spring wheat.

Prior to this, a batch of agricultural and pastoral products and local specialties produced in eastern Tibet had already been transported from Qamdo to Beijing.

    西藏运出一批农产品
    将参加全国农业展览会
    新华社拉萨17日电　又一批将在全国农业展览会上展出的西藏农牧业产品和土特产品，正在从拉萨运往北京。这些展览品包括有一百多个品种的大田作物和园艺作物，几十种高原上出产的著名药材。
    这些农产品，主要是进藏农业工作人员几年来引进的上千个品种中的一小部分，它们都适于在高原上种植。苏联冬黑麦在高原上试种结果，每亩产量达到一千斤。武功十七号和南大二四一九等春麦，也比当地春麦产量高过两倍。
    在这以前，已经有一批西藏东部地区出产的农牧业产品和土特产品，从昌都运往北京。
