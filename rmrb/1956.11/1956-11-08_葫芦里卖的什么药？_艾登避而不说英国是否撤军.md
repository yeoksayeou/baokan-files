What medicine is being sold in the gourd?
Eden avoids discussing whether Britain will withdraw its troops.
Xinhua News Agency, London, 7th November. After British Prime Minister Eden announced in the House of Commons on November 6 that Britain was prepared to cease further military action against Egypt under certain conditions, opposition Labour Party leader Gaitskell questioned Eden: First, will British and French troops continue to be deployed in the Suez Canal area; second, does accepting a ceasefire mean that British and French troops will withdraw on a suitable date; and third, has the British government abandoned its practice of forcibly imposing conditions on the establishment of a United Nations international force?
He also asked whether the government had abandoned the so-called "international management" conditions in resolving the Suez Canal issue.
Eden replied that after the ceasefire, British and French troops in the canal area would no longer move forward. Eden avoided answering the question of whether British and French troops would withdraw from Egypt. Regarding the question of whether to send additional reinforcements to Egypt, he said that it was necessary to land administrative troops and other troops that had to be stationed there due to the presence of British and French troops.
Eden also refused to answer the question of whether to abandon the plan to have Egypt accept "international management" of the canal. He said he could not go beyond the scope of the questions he had already discussed.
Eden also said he might issue another statement on November 7.

    葫芦里卖的什么药？
    艾登避而不说英国是否撤军
    新华社伦敦7日电　英国首相艾登11月6日在下院宣布英国准备在一定的条件下停止对埃及采取进一步的军事行动后，反对党工党领袖盖次克尔质问艾登：一、英法两国军队是否还要在苏伊士运河地区继续进行调动；二、接受停火是否意味着英法军队将要在适当的日期撤退；三、英国政府是否已经放弃对成立联合国国际部队问题强行提出条件的作法？
    他还问，在解决苏伊士运河问题上，政府是否已经放弃了所谓“国际管理”的条件？
    艾登回答说，停火以后，运河地区的英法军队不会再向前移动。对于是否从埃及撤退英法军队的问题，艾登避而不答。对于是否再派增援部队去埃及的问题，他说，必须派遣由于英法军队驻扎在那里而必须驻有的行政部队和其他部队登陆。
    艾登也不肯回答是否放弃要埃及接受“国际管理”运河的计划的问题。他说，他不能够超越他已经讲过的问题的范围。
    艾登还说，他可能要在11月7日发表另一项声明。
