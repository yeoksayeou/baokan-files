Xinhua News Agency, Karachi, November 8th - Bhashani, Chairman of the East Pakistan People's League, called for the holding of "Egypt Day" on November 9th to support "Egypt in distress."

Bhashani, in Dhaka on the evening of the 6th, criticized the United States for rejecting the Soviet proposal for joint US-Soviet action to stop the aggression, saying: "The role played by the United States in this struggle of the freedom-loving Egyptian people, or in the entire Middle East issue, is shameful. The Soviet government proposed that Russian and American troops unite to combat the peace disruptors in the Suez region. Not only did the United States not agree to undertake this responsibility itself, but it also warned the Soviet Union that any such action by the Soviet Union would meet with armed intervention by the United States on the side of the Anglo-French aggressors. Therefore, the game is now up. It is now clear to everyone that Anglo-French imperialism did not attack Egypt without the secret connivance and support of the United States."

Bhashani said: "Today, in any country in the world, the re-establishment of imperialist forces means a threat to the independence of all countries that have recently won independence. Therefore, it is the duty of all Pakistani citizens to assist Egypt in distress to the best of their ability."

The Karachi Urdu daily "Today's News" condemned the United States' rejection of the Soviet proposal in an editorial on November 7th, and also condemned the United States' statement that if the Soviet Union intervened in the Egyptian issue, the United States would also intervene. The newspaper said, "The clear purpose of the United States is: the United States itself actually neither wants to stop the Anglo-French offensive, nor does it want to let others do so." The newspaper said, "In this case, there is only one way to maintain peace, that is: the member states of the United Nations, especially the Asian-African group, should urge the United Nations General Assembly to adopt a resolution that Russia and the United States are jointly responsible for stopping the war in Egypt. If the United States expresses its unwillingness, then Russia should be authorized to fulfill the responsibility of maintaining peace in Egypt alone."

"Combat News" also condemned the United States' attitude of rejecting the Soviet proposal in an editorial on the 7th, saying that the Soviet proposal was "unimaginable" according to the United States. The newspaper asked: "The question is: why is this suggestion unimaginable? Is it possible to oppose stopping the aggressor? Is it unimaginable to suppress international rogue behavior?" The newspaper said: "One thing is very clear: Russia is not asking to attack. What Russia is asking for is that the Anglo-French troops should withdraw from Egyptian territory. This is also what the United States is asking for. So why does the United States disagree with Russia's proposal?"

### 美国露出纵容英法侵略埃及的马脚  巴基斯坦政界和舆论斥责美国拒绝苏联建议

    美国露出纵容英法侵略埃及的马脚
    巴基斯坦政界和舆论斥责美国拒绝苏联建议
    新华社卡拉奇8日电　东巴基斯坦人民联盟主席巴沙尼号召在11月9日举行“埃及日”，来支援“在苦难中的埃及”。
    巴沙尼6日晚间在达卡指责美国拒绝苏联提出的关于美苏采取联合行动制止侵略的建议说：“美国在爱好自由的埃及人民的这次斗争中或者说在整个中东问题上所扮演的角色是可耻的。苏联政府建议俄美部队联合起来打击苏伊士地区的和平破坏者。美国不但不同意自己承担这项责任，并且还警告苏联说苏联的任何这类行动都将遇到美国站在英法侵略者方面的武装干涉。因此现在已经露出了马脚。现在大家都清楚，英法帝国主义并不是没有得到美国的秘密纵容和支持而攻击埃及的。”
    巴沙尼说：“今天，在世界上任何国家中，帝国主义势力的重建就意味着对在最近赢得独立的所有国家的独立的威胁。因此，全体巴基斯坦公民的义务就是尽他们最大的能力援助处在苦难中的埃及。”
    卡拉奇乌尔都文日报“今天报”11月7日在社论中谴责美国拒绝苏联建议，并且谴责美国所宣称的如果苏联在埃及问题上进行干预，美国也将进行干预的说法。这家报纸说“美国的明显目的是：美国自己实际上既不希望制止英法的进攻，也不让其他人这样做。”这家报纸说：“在这种情况下，只有一个方法可以维护和平，就是：联合国会员国、特别是亚非集团应该在联合国大会促使通过这样一项决议：俄国和美国共同负责制止埃及境内的战争。如果美国表示不愿意，那就应该只授权俄国履行维护埃及境内的和平的责任。”
    “战斗报”在7日的社论中也谴责美国拒绝苏联建议的态度，照美国的说法苏联的建议是“不可想像的”。这家报纸问道：“问题在于：为什么这个建议是不可想像的？要制止侵略者，难道是可以反对的么？要镇压国际上的无赖行为，难道是不可想像的么？”这家报纸说：“有一点是非常清楚的：俄国并不是在要求进攻。俄国所要求的只是英法军队应该撤出埃及国土。这也是美国所要求的。那么美国为什么不同意俄国这项建议呢？”
