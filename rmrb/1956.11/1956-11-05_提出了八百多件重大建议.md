Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, November 4th: Soviet experts who are enthusiastically assisting Anshan Iron and Steel Company in its production with a lofty spirit of internationalism have put forward more than 800 major suggestions this year, which have played a significant role in improving Anshan Iron and Steel's technical and management levels.

    In the production of the Anshan Iron and Steel's ironmaking system, Soviet expert Posganoi and others further helped the workers of the sintering plant to improve the alkalinity and quality of self-fluxing sintered ore. They also helped the blast furnace workers to increase the number of iron taps from five or six times a day to seven times, reducing the damage to the slag notch and the time for changing tuyeres. According to the results of three months of trial operation, more than 9,000 tons of pig iron were produced for the country. Blast Furnace No. 4's production had been poor in the past. With the help of Soviet experts, this blast furnace has been transformed from a backward blast furnace that failed to complete its plan every month to an advanced blast furnace. With the help of experts such as Ninatsev, Ranko, and Filichken, Deputy Engineer Hu Guangpei and furnace protection technician Jin Fuchen created the experience of rapid sintering of open hearth furnace bottoms, increasing steel production for the country by more than 15,000 tons.
    Of the dozens of new products successfully trial-produced by Anshan Iron and Steel's various rolling mills this year, almost every new product embodies the wisdom and labor of Soviet experts. The square seamless steel pipes used as mine tunnel supports were designed with the help of Soviet expert Kachinko. The experts also helped the workers of the large rolling mill to successfully roll I-beams Nos. 4 and 5, exceeding the designed capacity. Soviet experts also helped the workers of the refractory material plant to successfully trial-produce a kind of "non-fired chrome-magnesium brick," which reduced a firing process, shortening the production time of chrome-magnesium bricks from the original 15 days to only 5 days.
    Soviet experts have also helped Anshan Iron and Steel improve the quality of heavy rails and improved the production method of rivet steel, increasing the first-grade rate of rivet steel from 5% to 67%. With the help of expert Malov, the promotion of nodular cast iron rolls to replace imported steel cast rolls has reduced costs by 90% and saved a large amount of foreign exchange.
    In terms of business management, Soviet experts have also helped Anshan Iron and Steel improve the labor organization of units such as the sintering plant and the engineering repair workshop, and put forward a plan to improve the labor organization of the Anshan Iron and Steel Central Laboratory. They helped formulate Anshan Iron and Steel's long-term development plan and this year's technical organization measures.
    In the first three years of the first five-year plan, Soviet experts who helped Anshan Iron and Steel improve its production technology and management level also put forward more than 3,000 major suggestions, which made a huge contribution to the development of Anshan Iron and Steel's production.

    苏联专家热情帮助我国进行工业建设
    提出了八百多件重大建议
    新华社鞍山4日电　以国际主义的崇高精神帮助鞍山钢铁公司进行生产的苏联专家，今年以来，共提出了八百多件重大建议，这些建议对于提高鞍钢的技术水平和管理水平起了重大作用。
    在鞍钢炼铁系统的生产中，苏联专家波斯加诺依等进一步帮助烧结总厂工人提高了自溶性烧结矿的碱度和质量；又帮助高炉工人由每天出五、六次铁改为七次，减少了渣口被烧坏的情况，并且减少了换风口的时间，据三个月试行结果统计，为国家增产了九千多吨生铁。四号高炉过去生产情况一直不好，在苏联专家帮助下，这座高炉已经由月月完不成计划的落后高炉变成先进高炉。由于尼那茨耶夫、兰柯、菲利奇肯等专家的帮助，副工程师胡光沛和护炉技师金福臣等创造了快速烧结炼钢平炉炉底的经验，为国家增产了一万五千多吨钢。
   鞍钢各个轧钢厂今年试制成功的数十种新产品中，几乎每一种新产品都凝结着苏联专家的智慧和劳动。用作矿山坑道支架的方形无缝钢管，是在苏联专家卡钦柯的帮助下设计出来的。专家们并帮助大型轧钢厂工人轧制成功了超过设计能力的四五号工字钢。苏联专家还帮助耐火材料厂工人试制成功了一种“不烧铬镁砖”，因为减少了一道烧成工序，使生产铬镁砖的时间由原来的十五天缩短到只要五天了。
    苏联专家还帮助鞍钢提高了重轨的质量，改进了轧制铆钉钢的生产方法，使铆钉钢的一级品率由5％提高到67％。在马洛夫专家的帮助下，推广了球墨铸铁轧辊来代替进口的钢铸轧辊，使成本降低了90％，并节省了大批的外汇。
    在企业管理方面，苏联专家也帮助鞍钢改善了烧结总厂和工程修理车间等单位的劳动组织，提出了改善鞍钢中央试验室劳动组织的方案。帮助制定了鞍钢发展的远景计划和今年的技术组织措施。
    帮助鞍钢提高生产技术和管理水平的苏联专家，在第一个五年计划的前三年中，还提出了三千多件重大建议，这些建议对于发展鞍钢的生产作了巨大的贡献。
