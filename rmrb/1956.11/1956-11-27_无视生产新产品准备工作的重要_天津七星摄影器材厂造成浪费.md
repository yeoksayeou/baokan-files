Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, November 26th: The Tianjin Qixing Photographic Equipment Manufacturing Factory, a joint state-private enterprise, caused a large amount of waste of valuable raw materials and production man-hours due to neglecting the preparatory work before putting new products into production.

This factory studied the use of imported film base to manufacture photographic film. After only a little over a month of small-scale testing, and before the product quality was stable, they rushed into production. By November 23, this batch of imported raw materials had been used up, but the amount of photographic film produced was less than half of the planned quantity. One-fifth of the film that had been produced became substandard. According to the factory's preliminary calculations, the cost loss alone was over 12,000 yuan.

At the beginning of this year, they washed off the chemicals on imported photographic film and re-coated it with chemicals manufactured by the factory itself. After several tests, the quality of the film was very good. They then believed that they had mastered the technology of manufacturing film and became complacent. This complacency arose. When a new batch of raw materials arrived at the factory, they started production without even figuring out the composition and performance of the raw materials.

During the production process, many new problems arose that were not resolved. As a result, most of the materials invested in the first three months of production were scrapped, and although a small portion was made into photographic film, the quality was poor. Thus, production had to be stopped in September. In November, the film quality problem was initially resolved, but the raw materials had already been used up, and production had to be stopped again.

### 无视生产新产品准备工作的重要  天津七星摄影器材厂造成浪费

    无视生产新产品准备工作的重要
    天津七星摄影器材厂造成浪费
    新华社天津26日电　天津公私合营七星摄影器材制造厂因忽视新产品投入生产前的准备工作，造成了贵重原料和生产工时的大量浪费。
    这个厂研究利用进口的软片基制造照像软片。仅仅经过一个多月的小型试验，产品质量还不稳定，就急忙地投入生产。到11月23日，这批进口的原料已经用完，可是生产出来的照像软片还不到计划数量的一半。已经生产出来的软片，有五分之一成了次品。据工厂初步计算，仅成本亏损就在一万二千元以上。
    他们在今年年初，曾把进口的照像软片上的药剂洗去，重新涂上工厂自己制造的药剂。经过几次试验，软片的质量很好。他们便认为已经掌握了制造软片的技术，自满了。产生了自满情绪。当一批新的原料到厂时，连原料的成分和性能也没有弄清楚就投入了生产。
    在生产中，发生了不少没有解决的新问题。因此，在开始生产的三个月中，投入的材料大部分报废了，小部分虽然制出了照像软片，但质量不好。这样，不得不在9月份停产。11月份，软片质量问题得到了初步解决，但原料已经用完，生产又不得不停下来。
