Xinhua News Agency, November 7th: Despite suffering severe natural disasters, Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces have still achieved largely bountiful late rice harvests. Northern Fujian province's mountainous areas also saw good late rice yields.

In Jiangsu province's Taihu Lake high-yield grain region, late rice crops were repeatedly hit by rain, floods, and multiple typhoons. Agricultural cooperatives resolutely combatted these disasters and improved farming techniques. It is estimated that the total output of the region's more than seven million mu of single-season late rice and a small portion of double-season late rice will still exceed that of the bountiful 1955 harvest. Zhenze County's more than 110,000 mu of late rice yielded an average of 660 jin per mu, 57 jin more than last year. The Lianmin Agricultural Cooperative in Songjiang County, led by national rice production model worker Chen Yongkang, expects its more than 5,000 mu of late rice to yield an average of around 730 jin per mu.

A significant portion of Zhejiang province's late rice crop also suffered from several typhoons, heavy rains, and droughts. However, the collective strength of the agricultural cooperatives ultimately overcame the various natural disasters. The expansion of double-cropping rice cultivation area also significantly increased late rice production. Preliminary estimates indicate that the province's more than seven million mu of single-season late rice, more than three million mu of double-season intercropped late rice, and more than six million mu of double-season continuous late rice will have a total output more than half a percent higher than last year. In Jiaxing Prefecture, which greatly expanded double-cropping rice cultivation this year, more than 1.7 million mu of double-cropping late rice yielded an average of about 60 jin per mu more than last year. In Tangdi Township, Shaoxing County, the more than 6,000 mu of double-cropping late rice currently being harvested averages 550 jin per mu; combined with the early season, nearly 2,000 mu are yielding over 1,000 jin. In many areas of Jiaxing Prefecture, single-season late rice yielded 600 to 700 jin per mu.

The vast majority of Nanping Prefecture in northern Fujian province consists of mountainous terraced fields, scattered and inconvenient for cultivation. In the past, these fields were planted with single-season late rice, with an average yield of less than 200 jin per mu. This year, after the realization of agricultural cooperation in the prefecture, agricultural cooperatives overcame the difficulties of insufficient labor and changed the habit of extensive cultivation. The prefecture's more than 4.5 million mu of single-season late rice yielded an average of 294 jin per mu, an increase of about 10% compared to last year. The high-yield fields of the Lintun Township Agricultural Production Cooperative in Zhenghe County achieved a maximum yield of 1,118 jin per mu. Judging from the already harvested areas, the more than 900,000 mu of double-cropping rice expanded this year in the prefecture have also seen significant increases in production.

### 江苏、浙江和福建北部晚稻丰收

    江苏、浙江和福建北部晚稻丰收
    新华社7日讯　在遭受严重自然灾害的情况下，江苏、浙江两省的晚稻仍大部丰收。福建省北部山区的晚稻收成也很好。
    江苏省太湖粮食高产区的晚稻曾经连续遭受雨涝和多次台风的侵袭，各农业社和这些灾害作了坚决的斗争，并且改进了耕作技术。这个地区七百多万亩单季晚稻和小部分双季晚稻，估计总产量仍超过丰收的1955年。震泽县十一万多亩晚稻每亩平均产量六百六十斤，比去年多收五十七斤。松江县的全国水稻丰产模范陈永康领导的联民农业社，五千多亩晚稻预计每亩平均产量可以达到七百三十斤左右。
    浙江省的晚稻也有很大一部分遭受几次台风、暴雨和干旱的侵袭。但是，农业社的集体力量终于战胜了各种自然灾害。各地双季连作稻种植面积的扩大，也使晚稻产量显著增加。全省七百多万亩单季晚稻、三百多万亩双季间作晚稻和六百多万亩双季连作晚稻，初步估计总产量比去年增加半成多。今年大面积扩种双季连作稻的嘉兴专区，一百七十多万亩双季连作晚稻平均每亩比去年多收约六十斤。绍兴县棠棣乡正在收割的六千多亩双季连作晚稻，平均每亩有五百五十斤；早晚两季合计，千斤田就有近二千亩。嘉兴专区许多地区的单季晚稻，每亩收了六、七百斤。
    福建省北部南平专区绝大部分是山垅梯田，零星分散，耕作不便。过去这些田种植单季晚稻，每亩平均产量不到两百斤。今年这个专区实现农业合作化后，各农业社克服了劳力不足的困难，改变了耕作粗放的习惯。全专区四百五十多万亩单季晚稻，每亩平均产量达到两百九十四斤，比去年增产一成左右。政和县林屯乡农业生产合作社的高额丰产田，最高产量达到每亩一千一百一十八斤。全专区今年扩大种植的九十多万亩双季稻，从已收割的情况看，也都显著增产。
