    Unite Positive Forces, Strengthen the United Front
  　Cai Tingkai
    Since the founding of the nation seven years ago, the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, have achieved unprecedented and brilliant victories both domestically and internationally.
    Domestically, we are currently in the midst of a high tide in the socialist revolution and construction. The socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce has achieved a definitive victory, and socialist industrialization has also made significant achievements. The first Five-Year Plan is about to be completed ahead of schedule and exceeded. As a result, our motherland has taken on a new look unprecedented in history.
    In international life, the United States originally wanted to isolate us, but the facts of the past few years have completely foiled the US's delusion. Since our country achieved revolutionary victory, it has not only established unbreakable friendship with socialist fraternal countries, but also increasingly strengthened its unity with all peace-loving countries. Our country's international status has greatly improved.
    Our achievements over the past seven years are the result of the hard work and struggle of the people of the whole country on all fronts under the correct leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party. If the People's Democratic United Front policy had not been correctly implemented, uniting and mobilizing all positive forces and overcoming negative factors, it would be hard to imagine achieving such great achievements in all aspects, both domestically and internationally, as we have today.
    Of course, we are not satisfied with our existing achievements, because we still have many arduous tasks to complete. To complete the arduous tasks of the transition period and build our country into a great socialist country, it will take a considerable amount of time. The open provocations and hidden conspiracies of imperialism have not yet ceased, and the struggle for the peaceful liberation of Taiwan and the struggle to stop war and defend world peace still require us to make greater efforts. On the other hand, some shortcomings and weaknesses still exist in our People's Democratic United Front and in the work of the democratic parties, which we need to correct and strengthen at any time in order to further consolidate the People's Democratic United Front and strive to achieve our common goals.
    From the perspective of the democratic parties themselves, since the principle of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision between the Communist Party and the democratic parties, with the emphasis on the democratic parties' role in supervising the Communist Party" was put forward, the erroneous idea that "democratic parties are dispensable," which was previously widespread among members, has been greatly clarified. There is a clearer understanding of the political role and historical status of the United Front and the democratic parties. Confidence in current work and future prospects has also increased compared to the past. Obviously, this is a great encouragement for members of the democratic parties to engage more in undertakings beneficial to the people. But it is also undeniable that some ideological obstacles still exist for members of the democratic parties in carrying out their own tasks, and there are still many shortcomings in their work. Taking the comrades of the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang (hereinafter referred to as the RCCK) as an example, some do not pay enough attention to their own political tasks, and some still have some incorrect understanding of expanding social ties. For example, some are not active enough in carrying out social contact work, and some people in society reflect that "the RCCK only makes contact work when the masses take the initiative to ask." Due to the existence of this shortcoming, the work in some places has been carried out later, and the work in some places has not been carried out enough even though the conditions are available. Many members of the organs do not care enough about social contact work. Many branches of the organs have also not paid attention to carrying out the work of contacting the masses of the organs. Some emphasize that their own work is busy or that their personal spare-time studies are important, and they are unwilling to spare some of their free time to engage in the work of contacting the masses. As for the work, attention is paid to social contact work, but the work of the members of the organs is neglected; attention is paid to the consolidation of the organization, but it is forgotten that development must be carried out to meet the needs of the work; or development has been carried out, but ideological education cannot be strengthened accordingly, and other problems also exist. The existence of this situation and shortcomings obviously has an adverse impact on the implementation and completion of the RCCK's political tasks. At the same time, some comrades who serve in government organs still have a sense of inferiority and are not proactive and active enough in their work, and are not willing to take responsibility. This is obviously a manifestation of a lack of a sense of responsibility as masters of the country, which is not only harmful to work, but also seriously hinders their own progress. From these situations, it shows that members of our democratic parties still need to strengthen their study, strengthen their transformation, and further improve themselves. Many people believe that after the principle of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" was put forward, the responsibilities of the democratic parties have become heavier. This is completely correct. We have no reason to feel inferior, and of course we cannot be complacent because of it. On the contrary, we should follow Chairman Mao's instruction that "modesty makes one progress, and pride makes one lag behind," study modestly, strengthen self-ideological transformation, and constantly check and improve our work. Only in this way can our organization meet the requirements of the new situation and tasks, gain more understanding and greater trust from the people, and better play its role of supervision in future work.
    As far as the entire United Front work is concerned, there are still some shortcomings. According to reports, the relationship between the Communist Party and non-Party members is not close enough in some places. For example, the Party is generally too polite to non-Party members, especially to leading comrades. As a result, non-Party members cannot speak freely in everything, and cannot reach the point where they know everything and say everything to each other. In many places, the United Front work departments contact non-Party members, generally limited to the leadership level, and some contacts are not frequent, especially the contact surface is small. In this way, there will inevitably be some restrictions in understanding the work of the democratic parties and providing timely assistance to the work of the democratic parties. In government organs, some Party organizations still lack due attention to the grassroots organizations of the democratic parties, rarely care about and understand the situation, assign tasks, and ignore the role that the grassroots organizations of the democratic parties can play in completing administrative tasks. Although this is not necessarily a universal problem, it will still cause some losses to the work. What is reflected more is that the United Front policy has not been implemented enough. Generally, the upper level does a good job, but the grassroots level does not do enough. Many places report that members of the democratic parties dare not admit their identity as members of the democratic parties when they work in counties and townships. A member of the RCCK in one place was once questioned by the Party organization in the countryside.
    These facts show that it is very necessary to vigorously publicize the principle of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" and to carry out ideological education on the United Front policy universally and for a long time. In order to overcome negative factors and unite positive forces, it is also necessary to conduct regular inspections of the shortcomings in the United Front work and gradually improve them. Only in this way can we better unite all forces that can be united and accelerate our country's socialist construction.
    Our current task is to further build China into a greater and happier socialist country. Therefore, we must not only mobilize all the positive factors of the 600 million people of the whole country and strengthen the People's Democratic United Front, but also further unite the positive forces of all countries in the world, and strive for more and greater victories at home and abroad on the basis of victory.

    团结积极力量，加强统一战线
  　蔡廷锴
    建国七年以来，中国人民在中国共产党的领导之下，在国内国际上取得了空前辉煌的胜利。
    国内目前正处在社会主义革命和社会主义建设的高潮中。国家对农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造已经获得了决定性的胜利，社会主义工业化也得到了重大的成就，第一个五年计划将要提前和超额完成。因而使我们的祖国出现了历史上从来未有的新面貌。
    在国际生活中，美国原来想孤立我们，但几年来的事实，使美国的妄想完全落空。我们国家取得革命胜利以来，不仅同社会主义阵营各兄弟国家建立了牢不可破的友谊，和一切爱好和平国家的团结也日益加强。我国的国际地位大大的提高了。
    我们七年来的成就，是全国人民在伟大的中国共产党正确领导下在各个战线上努力奋斗的结果。如果不是正确执行人民民主统一战线政策，团结和动员了一切积极力量，克服消极因素，要在国内国际各方面取得像今天这样大的成就，是很难想像的。
    当然，我们并不满足于现有的成绩，因为我们还有许多艰巨的任务没有完成。要完成过渡时期的艰巨任务，把我国建设成为一个伟大的社会主义国家，还需要相当长的时间。帝国主义的公开挑衅和隐蔽阴谋还未终止，和平解放台湾和制止战争、保卫世界和平的斗争，还需要我们作更大的努力；另一方面，我们的人民民主统一战线和民主党派内部若干工作上也还存在着一些缺点和弱点，需要我们随时改正和加强，以进一步巩固人民民主统一战线，为达到共同的目标而奋斗。
    从民主党派内部来说，自“共产党与各民主党派长期共存、互相监督，首先是对共产党起监督作用的方针”提出以后，在成员中，过去一直普遍存在的“民主党派可有可无”的错误思想，已大大的得到澄清，对于统一战线、民主党派的政治作用和历史地位有了较明确的认识；对于目前工作和未来前途的信心也较以前增强了。很显然，这对民主党派成员更多地去从事于有益人民的事业是极大的鼓舞。但也不可否认，民主党派成员在执行本身任务当中，也还存在着一些思想障碍，工作上还存在着不少缺点。就国民党革命委员会（以下简称民革）的同志说，有的对本身政治任务不够重视，对扩大社会联系，直到目前，还有人存在着一些不正确认识。如有的对开展社会联系工作，还不够积极主动，有社会人士反映：“民革搞联系工作，要等群众开口才联系”。由于这个缺点的存在，有的地方工作就开展得较迟，有的地方条件具备，工作却开展得不够。许多机关成员对社会联系工作关心不够。许多机关支部对联系机关群众工作也未注意开展，有的强调本身工作忙或个人业余进修要紧，不愿分出部分空余时间用在联系群众工作上。至如在工作中，注意到社会联系工作，却忽视了对机关成员的工作；注意了组织的巩固，就忘记了适应工作需要必须进行发展；或是发展了，思想教育却不能相应地加强等问题，也都是存在的。这种情况和缺点的存在，很显然，对民革政治任务的贯彻和完成上，是有不利的影响的。同时，在政府机关服务的同志中，有的还存在着自卑感，对工作不够主动积极，不能勇于负起责任，这显然是缺乏主人翁责任感的表现，这样不仅对工作有害，也严重地障碍了自身的进步。从这些情况看，说明我们民主党派成员还有待于加强学习、加强改造，进一步健全自己。许多人认为“长期共存，互相监督”的方针提出之后，民主党派的责任更加重了。这完全是正确的。我们没有理由感到自卑，当然更不能因而骄傲自满。相反的，我们应该遵从毛主席“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后”的指示，虚心学习，加强自我思想改造，不断地检查和改进工作。只有这样，我们的组织才能适应新形势任务的要求，才能够获得人民更多的了解和更大的信任，也才能够在今后各项工作中更好地发挥监督的作用。
    就整个统一战线工作来说，也还存在着一些缺点。根据反映，共产党与非党人士的关系，有的地方还不够密切。如党对党外人士，一般是太客气，特别对领导层同志是如此。因而党外人士也就不能凡事畅所欲言，相互间作到知无不言，言无不尽的地步。许多地方统战工作部门联系党外人士，一般限于领导层，有的接触还不经常，特别是接触面较小。这样，在了解各民主党派工作情况、及时对民主党派工作予以帮助方面，也就不可避免地受到了一些限制。在政府机关中，有的党组织对民主党派基层组织还缺乏应有的重视，很少关心和了解情况，交代任务，忽视了民主党派基层组织在完成行政任务中所能发生的作用。这尽管不一定是普遍的问题，但对工作来说，还是会造成一定损失的。反映得更多的是：统一战线政策还贯彻得不够。一般是上层做得很好，而基层做得不够。不少地方反映，民主党派成员到县、乡工作，就不敢承认自己的民主党派成员的身份，有一个地方的一个民革成员，在乡间就曾被党组织追问过。
    这些事实说明，大力宣传“长期共存，互相监督”的方针，普遍而长期地进行统一战线政策的思想教育工作，是十分必要的。为了克服消极因素，团结积极力量，对统战工作存在的缺点，也有必要进行经常的检查，逐步地加以改进。只有这样，才能够更好地团结一切可以团结的力量，加速我国的社会主义建设。
    我们目前的任务，是要把中国进一步建设成为一个更伟大幸福的社会主义国家。因此我们不但要动员全国六万万人民中的所有积极因素，加强人民民主统一战线；而且要进一步团结全世界各国的积极力量，在胜利的基础上，争取国内国际更多更大的胜利。
