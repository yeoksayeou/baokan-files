    Intolerable Service Attitude
    On the morning of September 16th (Sunday), I witnessed an infuriating incident at the Daodong Department Store in Siping City. An elderly man, about fifty years old, entered the department store to buy something. This old man was wearing tattered clothes, covered in sweat and dirt; from his pair of dark, rough hands, one could tell he was a farmer. This farmer went to the stationery section, wanting to choose a portrait of a great leader. The old man asked about the price, but the salesperson ignored him. The old man was very dissatisfied and questioned, "I am here to buy something, not to cause you trouble. The department store belongs to the state, am I not even allowed to look at things before buying?" At this moment, a staff member walked over and, without distinguishing right from wrong, pushed the old man away! Saying, "If you're not buying anything, leave quickly!" Just as this farmer was breathlessly arguing with them, another five or six staff members came over. Not only did they not help clarify the situation, but they also "aided the wicked," determined to drive the old man away. Some of them even held ropes, wanting to carry this old customer downstairs. I personally saw the person holding the rope hit the old man twice, and another person, who seemed to be a responsible cadre, even kicked the old man twice, and cursed, "Get out of here, the department store has nothing for you to buy." Then, they dragged and pulled the customer down the stairs, causing him to fall.
    The department store staff's atrocious behavior aroused public outrage among many customers and severely damaged the reputation of state-owned enterprises. As an eyewitness, I question the atrocious behavior of the Daodong Department Store staff in Siping City and demand that relevant departments conduct a serious investigation into their illegal behavior and severely punish them.

    不能容忍的服务态度
    9月16日（星期日）上午我在四平市道东百货公司看到一件令人愤慨的事。有一个五十来岁的老人走进了这家百货公司买东西，这老人穿着一身破衣裳，满头是汗土；从他一双黑黑的粗糙的手可以断定他是个农民。这个农民走到买文具的地方，想挑选一张伟人像。老人询问价钱，营业员不理。老人很不满，便质问道：“我是来买东西的，不是来找您麻烦的。百货公司是国家的，买东西难道看都不准看吗？”这时从旁边走过一个工作人员来，不分黑白就把老人推走！说：“你不买东西赶快走！”正当这个农民气喘喘地和他们争辩的时候，又走来了五、六个工作人员，他们不但不帮助弄清是非，反而“助纣为虐”，坚决要把老人赶走。其中还有人拿着绳子，想把这个老顾客抬到楼下。我亲眼看到拿绳子的人打了老人两下，另一个像是负责干部的人还踢了老人两脚，并且骂道：“赶快滚出去，百货公司没有你买的东西。”于是连打带拉把这个顾客从梯阶上摔倒梯阶下。
    百货公司营业人员的这种恶劣行为，引起了许多顾客的公愤，严重地损害了国营企业的威信。作为一个目击者，我对四平市道东百货公司营业人员的这种恶劣行为提出质问，并要求有关部门对他们的犯法行为进行认真调查，严肃处理。
