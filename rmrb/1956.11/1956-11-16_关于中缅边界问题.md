    Regarding the Sino-Burmese Border Issue
    Question: What is the 1941 line of the Sino-Burmese border mentioned in the Sino-Burmese Joint Communiqué?
    Answer: The 1941 line is in the 佧佤 (Kawa) Mountains in the southwest border of Yunnan, located west of Ban Hong, Cangyuan, Ximeng, and Menglian in Yunnan. The Kawa people live on both sides of this line.
    The Sino-British Boundary Treaties of 1894 and 1897 explicitly stipulated the delimitation of this section of the border, and boundary markers should have been erected according to the treaties long ago. However, due to Britain's deliberate aggression and the Qing government's ignorance and incompetence, the provisions in these treaties also contained many contradictions. Consequently, the Sino-British joint survey of this section of the border from 1899 to 1900 yielded no results. For decades, the two sides disputed the matter, resulting in an undefined national border. In April 1935, the Nationalist government and the British government organized the "Sino-British Joint Committee for the Survey of the Southern Section of the Yunnan-Burma Border" to conduct another survey of this section of the border. The Survey Committee consisted of representatives from both China and Britain, as well as a "neutral chairman" appointed by the League of Nations, who had the power of final decision. The Survey Committee put forward a border demarcation proposal, which caused considerable losses to China. The survey work concluded in 1937.
    After the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, Britain took advantage of China's critical situation and demanded that the Chinese government accept the recommendations put forward by the Survey Committee, threatening to block the Burma Road. Under these circumstances, the then Nationalist government accepted the British proposal based on the Survey Committee's recommendations. On June 18, 1941, China and Britain exchanged notes confirming this section of the border. The border defined by this exchange of notes is the 1941 line. No boundary markers have ever been erected along this section of the border.
    In 1951 and 1952, remnants of the Kuomintang army under Li Mi fled to Burma, entrenched themselves in the Kawa Mountains, and launched incursions into our country from that area. As the Burmese army had not yet arrived at the time, our army was forced to counterattack and stationed itself on both sides of the 1941 line.
    According to the Joint Communiqué issued by China and Burma on November 9, the Chinese army will withdraw from the area west of the 1941 line starting from the end of November 1956, and this withdrawal will be completed before the end of 1956.
    Question: Where are Pianma, Kangfang, and Gulang located?
    Answer: Pianma, Kangfang, and Gulang are located north of Tengchong County in Yunnan, in the undefined border area of the northern section of the Sino-Burmese border, east of the Gaoligong Mountains and west of the N'mai River. The residents of these three places are mainly the Tea Mountain people (a branch of the Jingpo ethnic group), with a small number of Han Chinese mixed in. Pianma, Kangfang, and Gulang were originally under the jurisdiction of the Denggeng Tusi (local chieftain) of Baoshan County in our country.
    Historically, the northern section of the Sino-Burmese border has never been demarcated. After 1898, Britain repeatedly demanded that China recognize the Gaoligong Mountains as the border in a rude and unreasonable manner, but the Qing government never agreed. In 1911, taking advantage of a conflict between the Denggeng Tusi and Han Chinese merchants in Pianma, Britain sent troops to forcibly occupy Pianma and stationed troops in areas north of Pianma. At that time, all Chinese people resolutely opposed this, triggering a strong anti-British movement demanding that British troops withdraw from Pianma. Yunnan organized the "China Border Protection Association," declaring a boycott of British goods and demanding arbitration by the "Hague Peace Conference." Under the angry protests of the Chinese people, the British government had to admit that Pianma, Kangfang, and Gulang were Chinese territories, but Britain bullied the Qing government's weakness and incompetence and continued to occupy these three places. This issue remained unresolved. Around 1922, the Chinese people learned that Britain had established administrative organizations in Pianma and other places, and expressed great indignation and protest. Various places organized "Pianma Support Associations" to provide support. However, the then Beiyang government did not dare to negotiate with Britain. Subsequently, Pianma and other places were forcibly occupied by Britain, and the Nationalist government ignored the matter. After Burma's independence in 1948, the Burmese government took over Pianma and the other two places from Britain.
    According to the Joint Communiqué issued by China and Burma on November 9, the Burmese army will withdraw from Pianma, Kangfang, and Gulang starting from the end of November 1956, and this withdrawal will be completed before the end of 1956.

    关于中缅边界问题
    问：中缅联合新闻公报中提到的中缅边界1941年线是怎样的一条线？
    答：1941年线在云南西南边疆的佧佤山区，位于云南班洪、沧源、西盟和孟连以西，该线两边都居住着佧佤族人。
    1894年和1897年中、英两国签订的中缅界务条约对这段边界的划定曾有明文规定，早应按约划界，树立界桩。由于英国蓄意侵略，满清政府昏庸无知，这个条约上的规定也有不少自相矛盾的地方，因而1899年至1900年中、英双方勘察这段边界没有结果。几十年来，双方争执不决，形成一段未定国界。1935年4月国民党政府和英国政府组织“中英会勘滇缅南段界务委员会”，决定再次勘察这段边界。勘委会由中英双方及国际联盟派的一位“中立委员长”组成，“中立委员长”有最后票决之权。勘委会提出了划界建议，这个建议使中国受了不少损失。1937年勘察工作结束。
    抗日战争爆发后，英国利用中国面临的危急情况，要求中国政府接受勘委会提出的建议，并以封锁滇缅公路作为要挟。在这种情况下，当时的国民党政府接受了英方根据勘委会建议所提出的方案，1941年6月18日中英双方换文确定了这段边界，这个换文所确定的边界就是1941年线。这段边界一直没有树立界桩。
    1951年和1952年，国民党李弥残匪逃往缅甸，盘据了佧佤山区，并从该地区向我国进扰，当时缅军又未到达，我军被迫反击，进驻到1941年线两侧。
    根据11月9日中缅双方发表的联合新闻公报，从1956年11月底起，中国军队将撤出1941年线以西地区，这项撤军工作将在1956年年底前完成。
    问：片马、岗房和古浪在什么地方？
    答：片马、岗房和古浪在云南腾冲县的北面，是中缅北段未定界地区的三个地方，东边是高黎贡山，西边是恩梅开江。这三个地方的居民主要是茶山族（景颇族的一个支系），有少数汉人杂居。片马、岗房和古浪原来是我国保山县登埂土司所管辖的地方。
    中缅北段边界历史上从来没有划定，1898年以后，英国多次以蛮横无理的态度要中国承认以高黎贡山为界，当时的满清政府始终没有答应。1911年英国乘登埂土司和片马的汉族商人发生冲突的时候，派兵强占了片马，并分兵驻扎在片马以北的地方。当时全中国人民坚决反对，激起强大的反英运动，要求英军撤出片马。云南曾组织了“中国保界会”，宣言抵制英货，要求“海牙和平会”公断。在中国人民忿怒的抗议下，英国政府不得不承认片马、岗房和古浪是中国地方，但英国欺侮满清政府的软弱无能，继续占领这三个地方。这个问题一直没有得到解决。1922年前后，中国人民知道了英国在片马等地方建立了行政组织，中国人民表示了极大的愤慨和抗议，各地曾组织“片马后援会”来声援。但当时的北洋政府竟不敢向英国交涉。此后片马等地始终被英国强占，国民党政府也不闻不问。1948年缅甸独立以后，缅甸政府从英国手里接管了片马等三个地方。
    根据11月9日中缅双方发表的联合新闻公报，从1956年11月底起，缅甸军队将撤出片马、岗房、古浪三个地方，这项撤军工作将在1956年年底前完成。
