Xinhua News Agency, London, November 14th (Reporter Peng Di) - The Communist Party of Great Britain has announced that it will hold a National Special Congress of the Party in early next year. The Party Congress was originally scheduled for 1958. This decision was made at the most recent meeting of the Party's Executive Committee. The Executive Committee announced that it had decided to convene the National Special Congress because "it is now clear that such a congress is necessary in order to strengthen the Party's struggle to defeat the Conservative Party, to win the unity of the labor movement and to defend peace."

The announcement stated that the Special Congress will discuss the Party Program "Britain's Road to Socialism" and the issue of improving intra-party democracy. The announcement said that it is also necessary for party members to have the opportunity to express affirmative opinions on the various tendencies that have now emerged to reduce the role of the party or weaken its organizational principles, and to make the necessary decisions to strengthen the struggle to build the Party, the Communist Youth League and increase the circulation of the "Daily Worker".

The preliminary agenda for the Congress will include a political report from the Executive Committee. It is expected that the Congress will discuss the overall political situation, particularly the Middle East issue and the Hungarian event.

Discussions on these major current issues, especially on the Hungarian issue, have in fact been taking place among workers and within the Party for some time. According to the "Daily Worker," General Secretary Gollan's report concluded the discussion. The unity of the Party leadership on these crucial issues is reflected in the fact that the Executive Committee unanimously adopted Gollan's report.

    英共将开全国特别代表大会
    讨论英国走向社会主义的道路和党内民主问题
    据新华社伦敦14日电　本社记者彭迪报道：英国共产党宣布，将在明年年初举行党的全国特别代表大会，党的代表大会原定在1958年举行。这个决定是在党的执行委员会最近一次会议上作出的。执行委员会宣布，它之所以决定召开全国特别代表大会是由于“现在已经可以清楚看出，为了加强党的击败保守党、争取劳工运动的团结和保卫和平的斗争，这样一次代表大会是必要的。”
    公告说，特别代表大会将讨论党纲“英国走向社会主义的道路”和改进党内民主的问题。公告说，同时也有必要使党员们有机会来对现在已经显现出来的缩小党的作用或削弱它的组织原则的各种倾向发表肯定的意见，并且作出必要的决定来加强建设党、共产主义青年团和增加“工人日报”销数的斗争。
    在代表大会初步议程中将有执行委员会的政治报告。预料在代表大会上将讨论总的政治局势问题，特别是中东问题和匈牙利事件。
    关于这些当前重大问题，特别是关于匈牙利问题的讨论，实际上一些时候以来就已经在工人之间和党内进行了。据“工人日报”报道，党总书记高兰的报告对讨论作出了结论。在这些决定性的问题上，党的领导的团结可以从执行委员会一致通过高兰的报告这一事实中反映出来。
