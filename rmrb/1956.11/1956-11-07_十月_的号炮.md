    The Clarion Call of "October"
    Yu Zhiguang

    The clarion call of the great October Socialist Revolution awakened so many from their slumber, stirred the sense of dignity in so many, and awakened the self-awareness of so many: the injured and insulted working people should and can stand tall and be masters of the world.

    Under the illumination of the Soviet Union, this lighthouse of humanity, how many torches of national liberation struggles and people's liberation struggles have been ignited in the dark world! Armed with the ideas of Marxism-Leninism, people advanced wave upon wave along the road opened up by the October Revolution towards the goals of independence, democracy, and freedom, and towards the goals of socialism. How many tyrants' thrones have been overthrown, how many cannibalistic feasts have been smashed, how many aggressors' dreams have been shattered! One country after another is learning from the example of the Soviet Union, clearing the rubble on the ruins, gradually building the palace of a new life, and the powerful socialist camp led by the Soviet Union has been formed, developed, and consolidated.

    Recalling the clarion call of the October Revolution thirty-nine years ago, we Chinese people feel particularly close and excited. In the deep suffering of life, the "October" call enlightened us; in the difficult years of the national liberation struggle and the people's liberation struggle, the "October" call encouraged us; on the road of socialist construction, the "October" call inspired us. Regardless of this period or that period, the great Soviet Union has always given us selfless brotherly assistance. Without the "October" call, without the Soviet Union, there could be no China as it is today, no powerful socialist camp as it is today!

    Precisely because of this, the imperialists, who are addicted to aggression, and the traitors who betray the motherland and betray the interests of the people, have been spewing dirty spittle at the Soviet Union, attempting to use despicable "subversive activities" to break open a gap in the socialist camp and save the decadent capitalist world. They have always been obsessed with such and such playing-with-fire tricks!

    You see, before the Hungarian reactionary restoration forces were destroyed, when the true Hungarian patriots were being beaten and slaughtered, how complacent the imperialists were! Some allocated funds, some offered "respect," they were convinced that a gap had really been broken in the socialist camp! But after suffering more than ten days of bloody lessons, the Hungarian patriotic people should see more clearly: who is the friend and who is the enemy! With the assistance of the Soviet troops stationed in Hungary, they smashed the counter-revolutionary forces in one fell swoop!

    The historical experience since the October Revolution is rich, and the lessons of the Hungarian incident are profound, we should have a good memory. The Hungarian incident tells us: leaving the Soviet Union, leaving socialism, will lead to disaster, will lead to the restoration of landlords and capitalists. Let the "October" call forever reverberate in our hearts, let us forever advance along the road opened up by the October Socialist Revolution!

### “十月”的号炮

    “十月”的号炮
    俞之光
    伟大的十月社会主义革命的号炮，惊醒了多少人的昏梦，激起了多少人的尊严感，唤起了多少人的自觉：被损害、被侮辱的劳动人民应该而且能够挺立起来，作世界的主人。
    在苏联这座人类的灯塔的照耀下，黑暗世界里燃起了多少民族解放斗争和人民解放斗争的火炬！人们带着马克思列宁主义的思想武装，沿着十月革命所开辟的道路，前仆后继地向独立、民主、自由的目标前进，向社会主义的目标前进。多少暴君的宝座被推翻了，多少人肉筵宴被捣毁了，多少侵略者的迷梦被粉碎了！一个国家接着一个国家学着苏联的榜样，扫清废墟上的瓦砾，逐步建立着新生活的殿堂，以苏联为首的强大社会主义阵营形成了，发展了，巩固了。
    回想起三十九年前十月革命的号炮，我们中国人民特别感到亲切和激动。在深重的生活苦难中，“十月”的号炮启示了我们；在民族解放斗争和人民解放斗争的艰难的岁月里，“十月”的号炮鼓舞了我们；在社会主义建设的途程中，“十月”的号炮激励了我们。不管在这一时期或那一时期，伟大的苏联一直给我们以无私的兄弟般的援助。没有“十月”的号炮，没有苏联，就不可能有今天这样的中国，不可能有今天的强大社会主义阵营！
    正因为如此，侵略成性的帝国主义者和出卖祖国、出卖人民利益的叛徒们一直向苏联喷吐着肮脏的唾沫，妄图用卑鄙的“颠复活动”打破社会主义阵营的缺口，挽救腐朽的资本主义的乾坤。他们一直醉心于这样那样的玩火把戏！
    你们看，匈牙利反动复辟势力被摧毁以前，当匈牙利的真正爱国者们被毒打、被屠杀的时候，帝国主义者是多么得意忘形呀！有的拨款，有的“致敬”，他们满以为社会主义阵营真的被打破了一个缺口！可是受了十几天的血的教训之后，匈牙利爱国人民应该看得更清楚了：到底谁是朋友，谁是敌人！他们在驻匈苏军的援助下，一下子把反革命势力粉碎了！
    十月革命以来的历史经验是丰富的，匈牙利事件的教训是深刻的，我们应该有记性。匈牙利事件告诉我们：离开苏联，离开社会主义，便要招致灾难，便要招致地主资本家的复辟。让“十月”的号炮永远在我们的心里震响，让我们永远沿着十月社会主义革命所开辟的道路前进！
