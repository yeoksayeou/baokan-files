    Egypt, We Must Support You!
    Cao Yu

    These past few days, every morning at daybreak, I have been waiting for the newspaper, hoping to see any news about Egypt, which is fighting.

    Egypt! Inspiring, great Egypt, your every move firmly grips the hearts of people all over the world! You are defending your homeland, you are driving out the robbers who have invaded your land, you are setting an example for the oppressed slaves in colonies all over the world. In the twentieth century, you will give these remaining, but still rampant, colonialists a severe lesson.

    Who is righteous and who is the aggressor has been clearly exposed in the sunlight. Who will win and who will lose, in our hearts, we have long made a conclusion for you—great Egypt. Brave and strong, like the indestructible pyramids, you are not the only steel army; behind you will be volunteer soldiers from all over the world, acting as your strong backing. On your beautiful land, fierce fires are burning. We can hear the sound of British and French planes bombing over your heads. We can hear the battle cries of the warriors defending Port Said. The collapse of each of your houses is like the collapse of our own houses, and every bullet you fire into the enemy's chest is like revenge for us.

    Egyptian people, my brothers! You are not alone. Everyone in China will say, "No, it is not just 'I' who is supporting the great Egypt, I also have 600 million brothers supporting you. In this huge team, it is not 'I,' but the spirit and strength represented by the great and powerful word 'we' that is supporting Egypt fighting today!"

    When Egypt declared war against the invaders, the news reached Beijing, which was in the severe winter. But 400,000 Beijing citizens immediately gathered from all directions. They angrily demonstrated against Britain and France in front of Tiananmen Square, and they enthusiastically shouted to their Egyptian brothers in the distance, "We must support you!"

    That day, 400,000 people surged to the front of the British Chargé d'affaires' office. 400,000 people roared in unison. Their voices shook the heavens and the earth, shaking that old imperialist embassy like a broken ship in a storm. Great Egyptian brothers, you on the banks of the Nile can also hear the Chinese people cheering for you. Standing at the mouth of the Suez Canal, you can also hear how enthusiastically we wave our flags, cheering for the brave men who firmly defend Egypt.

    That day, I saw an Egyptian with black hair, a tall figure, and eyes revealing bravery and intelligence on the street. I couldn't help but run up to him and embrace him. I said to him, "Egyptian brothers striving for freedom and independence, your destiny is my destiny!"

    "We must support you!" This sentence has become the slogan of the people of the world's actions. Our university students say, "Give me weapons, give me documents, send me to Egypt! Believe me, I will definitely defeat the invaders and return triumphantly!" On the very day Egypt declared war, so many of our artists applied to go to Egypt immediately, as reporters at the war zone, to announce your heroic achievements to the world. Even our young mothers, holding her firstborn infant, also wrote an enthusiastic letter, saying in the letter: "For you, dear Egyptian brothers, I want to put down my newborn infant and come to the banks of the Suez Canal to help you!"

    "We must support you!" This sentence made the great Soviet Union issue a serious warning to British and French imperialism. This warning made the imperialists tremble with fear and was forced to announce a temporary ceasefire. Dear Egyptian brothers, how excited we are when the news comes. Amidst the gunfire, we see that imperialism will sooner or later bury itself with its gunboat policy. How excited we are, because in the midst of the gunfire, every Chinese person sees an independent and free Egypt, like a phoenix reborn, rising proudly and beautifully!

    We must support you, dear Egyptian brothers! We know that British and French imperialism has not really laid down its arms, and they attempt to continue the massacre, but you will do as President Nasser announced, and unless the invaders completely withdraw from Egyptian territory, they will surely suffer humiliation and death. Colonialists of the world, give up on this idea! Today's world does not allow robbers to run rampant, and no one believes that the gunboat policy has any threatening effect! British and French imperialists, do not think about colluding with hypocritical America and carrying out aggression in a secret way again! The people of Africa and Asia have united, and no matter how you change, you cannot escape the end of complete failure.

    The Chinese people will never stop supporting Egypt until Egypt wins. We look at the Mediterranean Sea, which is far away and pitch black, with the sky full of war clouds. Although the artillery has temporarily silenced its throat, it may spew out brutal, murderous flames at any time. In the pitch-black Mediterranean Sea, our voices will pass through the gunboats and warships in the smoke and fog, reaching the hearts of the Egyptian people.

    We must support you! We will never rest, and we will support this great people's struggle for independence with everything humanly possible. We want to announce to the world, and declare to the imperialists in the most powerful words: No matter how dark the sky is over the Mediterranean, no matter how war conspiracies are carried out in the dark warships in the Mediterranean, we will, as the freedom-loving poet Heine said, use our powerful hands to pull down thick ancient pines from the top of Mount Everest, dip them in the raging fire in the hearts of the Chinese people, and use this huge fiery pen to write burning words in the dark sky of the Mediterranean Sea: "Egypt, we must support you!"

### 埃及，我们定要支援你！

    埃及，我们定要支援你！
    曹禺
    这几天，每天天一亮，我就等着报纸，希望看到关于在战斗着的埃及的任何消息。
    埃及！令人振奋的伟大的埃及，你一举一动都牢牢吸引住全世界人民的心灵！你在保卫自己的祖国，你在驱逐侵入自己土地上的强盗，你为全世界殖民地的被压迫的奴隶们树立了榜样。在二十世纪的今天，你将给这些残余的、但依然猖狂的殖民主义者一个严厉的教训。
    谁是正义的，谁是侵略者，已经清清楚楚地暴露在太阳光下。谁会胜利，谁会失败，在我们心里，早为你——伟大的埃及，做下了定论。英勇坚强，有如金字塔一般不可摧毁的埃及人们哪，你不是唯一的一支钢铁的军队，你身后将有来自全世界各地的志愿兵士，做你的有力的后盾。在你的美丽的土地上，熊熊地燃起了烈火，我们听得见英法的飞机在你们头上轰炸的响声，我们听得见守住塞得港的勇士们的战斗的呐喊。你们每座房屋的倒塌就像我们自己房屋的倒塌，你们每一颗枪弹打进敌人的胸膛，就像替我们复仇一样。
    埃及人民哟，我的兄弟！你不是孤独的。在中国每一个人都会这样说：“不，不是我一个在支援着伟大的埃及，我还有六亿兄弟在支援着你。在这支庞大的队伍里，不是‘我’，而是‘我们’这个伟大有力的字所代表的精神和力量，在支援着今天战斗的埃及！”
    当埃及向侵略者宣布抗战的时候，消息传到了北京，那是严寒的冬天。但从四面八方立刻汇集起来四十万北京的市民，他们愤怒地在天安门前向英法示威，他们热烈地向远方埃及的兄弟高声呼喊：“我们定要支援你！”　　那一天，四十万人涌到英国代办处的门前，四十万人一齐怒吼，他们的声音震动天地，把那古老的帝国主义的使馆摇撼得像暴风雨中的一只破船。伟大的埃及兄弟，你们在尼罗河畔，也会听得见中国人民向你们欢呼，你们立在苏伊士运河的河口上，也会听得见我们如何热烈地摇着旗帜，向坚强守卫着埃及的勇士们欢呼。
    那一天，我在街上看见一个黑头发、高身材、眼神里透露出勇敢和聪明的埃及人，我忍不住跑到他的面前将他拥抱，我对他说：“争取自由独立的埃及兄弟，你的命运就是我的命运！”
    “我们定要支援你！”这句话已经成了全世界人民行动的口号。我们的大学生说：“给我武器，给我证件，派我到埃及去！相信我，我一定打败侵略者，凯旋归来！”我们的文艺家们就在埃及宣布抗战的那一天，便有多少人申请，立刻到埃及去，作战地的记者，把你们英勇的战绩向全世界宣布。连我们年青的母亲，抱着她头生的婴儿，也亲笔写了热情洋溢的信，信里说：“为了你，亲爱的埃及兄弟，我要放下我初生的婴儿，到苏伊士河边来援助你！”
    “我们定要支援你！”这句话使伟大的苏联向英法帝国主义提出严重的警告，这警告使得帝国主义者胆战心惊，被迫宣布暂时停火。亲爱的埃及兄弟们，消息传来，我们是多么兴奋，在炮火当中，我们看见帝国主义早晚要以他们的炮舰政策葬埋了自己。我们是多么兴奋，因为在炮火当中，我们每一个中国人都看见一个独立而自由的埃及，已像再生的凤凰，骄傲而美丽地飞起！
    我们定要支援你，亲爱的埃及兄弟！我们知道英法帝国主义并没有真正放下武器，他们企图继续屠杀，但你们将像纳赛尔总统宣布的那样做，侵略者不完全退出埃及的国土，他们就一定遭到耻辱和死亡。全世界的殖民主义者，你们死了这条心吧！今天的世界不许强盗们横行，谁也不相信炮舰政策还有什么威胁的效用！英法帝国主义者们，你们不要再想勾结伪善的美国，用隐秘的方式再进行侵略！非洲和亚洲的人民已经团结起来，你们千变万化也逃不出彻底失败的结局。
    中国人民将永不停止对埃及的支援，一直到埃及胜利为止。我们望着远远一片漆黑的地中海上，满天弥漫着战云。大炮虽然暂时哑了喉咙，但随时它会吐出残暴的杀人的火焰。在一片漆黑的地中海上，我们的声音将穿过硝烟浓雾中的炮舰和战艇，达到埃及人民的心里。
    我们定要支援你！我们将永不歇息，我们将以人力所能做到的一切，来支援这伟大的人民争取独立。我们要向全世界宣告，用最强有力的文字向帝国主义者宣告：不管地中海上空是如何的黑暗，不管在地中海阴暗的军舰里如何进行着战争的诡计，我们将像爱自由的诗人海涅所说的，以强大的手，从珠穆朗玛峰顶上拔下粗大的古松，蘸着中国人民心里的烈火，用这支巨大的火笔，在地中海黑暗的天空上写下燃烧的字句：“埃及，我们定要支援你！”
