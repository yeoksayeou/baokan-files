Xinhua News Agency, November 4th: The National First Congress of Active Workers in Science and Technology Popularization sent a letter to workers nationwide, calling on them to strive to learn scientific and technological knowledge.

The letter put forward three expectations for male and female workers nationwide:

*   Don't be afraid of difficulties, don't be greedy for quick results, and carry out persistent and regular learning in a realistic and pragmatic manner.
*   Cooperate closely with scientific and technological workers, take into account their work situation, and humbly put forward hopes and requirements to them.
*   Actively support and assist the organizational workers of trade unions and science popularization associations, frequently reflect opinions to them, and consult with them on organizational forms and learning methods.

The letter said: At this conference, the speeches of many scientific and technological workers, using vivid examples, illustrated how they enthusiastically imparted scientific and technological knowledge to the working people, improved production, and at the same time, improved themselves. Originally, the production practice of the working people is the source of the generation and development of science and technology; scientific and technological research work, from the source of topic selection to the conduct and verification of research, all the way to the promotion of results, is closely related to the production experience and scientific and technological level of the working people on the production site. It can be seen that science guides the progress of production, and at the same time, production and producers also put forward infinitely rich questions to science and technology. After this conference, it is believed that an even greater force will be added to the ranks of science and technology popularization in our country. The conference placed ardent hopes and congratulations on the continuous expansion of the ranks of science and technology popularization work.

At this conference, many worker-students reported examples of humbly learning and diligently studying science and technology, and conveyed the urgent demands of the broad masses of workers for learning scientific and technological knowledge. Their soaring enthusiasm for learning was stimulated by the socialist competition, and they tried every means to improve their knowledge and appropriately combine learning with the completion of production tasks. The narration of these examples connected the thoughts and feelings of the representatives attending the conference with the vast and diverse production sites, and also made us feel as if we had entered these many special forms of beautiful schools.

The letter said: Doing a good job in popularizing scientific and technological knowledge is the ardent hope of the Party and the people of the whole country, and it is a glorious task that the cause of socialist construction in the motherland has put forward to us with no delay. If the contribution of our workers to the completion of our first five-year plan lies mainly in the improvement of political awareness and the strengthening of labor organization, thereby unleashing the potential power of labor; then, the tasks submitted to us by the even greater second five-year plan, in addition to the need to continue to promote the noble qualities of the high degree of organization and discipline inherent in our working class, will more prominently require us to use our high degree of tenacity and perseverance to improve our scientific and technological level.

    全国职工科普工作积极分子大会写信给全国职工
    号召他们努力学习科学技术知识
    新华社4日讯　全国第一次职工科学技术普及工作积极分子大会全体代表写信给全国职工，号召他们努力学习科学技术知识。
    这封信中对全国男女职工提出了三点希望：
    不怕困难，不贪多图快，实事求是地进行顽强的、经常的学习；
    密切地同科学技术工作者合作，顾到他们的工作情况，虚心地向他们提出希望和要求；
    积极地支持和协助工会和科普协会的组织工作者，经常向他们反映意见，同他们协商学习的组织形式和学习方法。
    信中说：在这次大会上，许多科学技术工作者的发言，用生动的事例，说明他们热情地把科学技术知识传授给劳动人民，提高了生产，同时他们自己也得到了提高。本来，劳动人民的生产实践是科学技术产生和发展的源泉；科学技术研究工作，从选题的来源到研究的进行和证验，一直到成果的推广，都和生产现场的劳动人民的生产经验和科学技术水平密切相关，可见，科学指导生产前进，同时，生产和生产者也向科学技术提出了无限丰富的问题。这次大会之后，相信我国科学技术普及工作的队伍中必将添进更加浩大的力量。大会对于科学技术普及工作的队伍的不断扩大寄予殷切的希望和祝贺。
    在这次大会上，许多职工学员报告了虚心学习、刻苦钻研科学技术的范例，并且转达了广大职工迫切要求学习科学技术知识的呼声。他们高涨的学习热忱是社会主义竞赛所激起来的，他们想尽一切办法提高自己的知识，把学习和完成生产任务恰当地结合起来。这些事例的叙述，使参加大会的代表们的思想感情，和广大的多种多样的生产现场联结起来，也使我们仿佛走进了这许多特殊形式的美好的学校。
    信中说：把普及科学技术知识的工作做好，是党和全国人民殷切的希望，是祖国社会主义建设事业向我们提出的刻不容缓的光荣任务。如果说，我们第一个五年计划的完成，在职工方面的贡献，主要在于政治觉悟的提高，劳动组织的加强，从而发挥了劳动的潜在力量；那么，更加伟大的第二个五年计划所提交我们的任务，除了需要继续发扬我们工人阶级固有的高度组织性和纪律性的高贵品质以外，就更加突出地需要我们运用我们高度的顽强性和坚韧性来提高我们的科学技术水平。
