　　Xinhua News Agency, Prague, November 15th: Budapest News: The Hungarian Revolutionary Worker-Peasant Government held a meeting on November 12th, at which some important decisions were adopted.

　　The government pointed out that due to the measures taken in the past few days, the supply of materials to the residents of Budapest has been greatly improved. The difficulties currently existing in supply are primarily due to the situation that makes railway transportation, as well as work in production and shops, difficult to carry out. As the institutions responsible for supply in other areas have already begun work, the supply of materials to the capital is expected to gradually improve in the coming days.

　　The Hungarian government emphasized that the grain and other goods supplied by friendly countries are of great help to the Hungarian people. The government has decided to establish a government committee responsible for restoration and construction work.

　　The working people of the Hungarian capital and other areas are working hard to carry out restoration work. More and more workers in factories and institutions are returning to their jobs. Many laborers are repairing buildings that were damaged and destroyed by counter-revolutionaries with grief and indignation. In Budapest alone, more than 25,000 people have participated in the work of construction units.

　　In the days of restoration work, the working people will never forget the white terror created by the counter-revolutionaries during the riots more than ten days ago. Many residences in Budapest are hanging black flags to mourn those who sacrificed in the battles. Such flags also hang on the windows of the apartment buildings where more than 200 communists at the district level of the Labor People's Party lived; these people and their families—wives, children, and parents—were often thrown into the street from the fourth or fifth floor by fascists. Many people have shown selfless enthusiasm to heal the wounds caused by the riots with hard work. Newspapers published letters from workers at the MOM Optical Instrument Factory in Budapest. The workers firmly demanded that resolute measures be taken against counter-revolutionaries, slackers, and those who spread destructive rumors in order to eliminate the consequences of the counter-revolutionary rebellion more quickly.

　　In order to restore normal production activities, Hungarian industrial enterprises are trying to overcome difficulties mainly caused by lack of raw materials and insufficient transportation capacity. According to a bulletin from the press office of the Hungarian Ministry of Metallurgy and Machine Manufacturing Industry, preparations for resuming production have been made in many metallurgical and machine manufacturing plants. A foundry in the Ozd factory is still producing on a limited scale. Only one of the Martin furnaces in this factory has returned to normal production. At the Lenin Iron and Steel Plant in Diosgyor, only two blast furnaces and one Martin furnace are in production, and smooth production is still hampered by lack of raw materials and power. In Zala County, all enterprises have resumed work, but production there is also not proceeding smoothly. The same problems exist in factories in Szeged, such as the textile factories there, which only work four hours a day due to lack of raw materials. In the enterprises in Debrecen, about 70% of the workers have returned to work. The supply there is very smooth. Coal, glass, and salt are being continuously transported from the Romanian People's Republic.

　　Komárom Province announced that the miners of Totobánya also encountered many difficulties in returning to work, because some sections of the mine had fallen into a state of disrepair. After going to work, the miners immediately guaranteed to supply the Totobánya power plant, hospitals, schools, and bakeries with the coal they needed.

　　Xinhua News Agency, November 15th: According to TASS, Moscow: "Pravda" published on the 14th a report by its Budapest correspondents Krushinsky and Mayevsky on the situation in Hungary.

　　They reported that life in Hungary is currently returning to normal. November 12th was the day when most industrial enterprises in Budapest resumed work on a large scale. The morning whistles from the factories in Budapest also started on November 13th. More and more grain is being transported into the city. It is reported that almost all of the grain aid that the Soviet Union decided to send to the Hungarian people has already been shipped. Seventy-six railcars of sugar, twenty-three railcars of flour, forty railcars of canned milk, oils, meats, and other items have been transported to Budapest. Thirty-one railcars of sugar, twenty-one railcars of flour, and other foods have also been transported to Győrvár. Large amounts of aid grain are being transported to Hungary from European People's Democratic countries and the People's Republic of China.

　　The reporters also reported that measures are currently being taken to effectively defend the labor and tranquility of the working people from the terrorist attacks of the remnants of the defeated counter-revolutionary forces. On November 12th, two public security corps composed of volunteers were established in Budapest.

　　The reporters also pointed out in their report that the true faces of the active participants in the counter-revolutionary conspiracy are becoming increasingly clear. At the moment when the counter-revolutionaries launched their uprising, a famous reactionary figure appeared in Budapest—Prince Li Wen Shi Tai Yin, who came to Budapest with a passport from the Federal Republic of Germany. Li Wen Shi Tai Yin openly provoked and created chaos. Not long after, Count Dukwalte led a gang of 54 bandits to Hungary. The bandits infiltrated Budapest disguised as medical train staff, but were actually directing the counter-revolutionary attack. Horthy officers who had been lying dormant and had rushed back from West Germany and Austria held weapons and directed the attack on the people's regime.

    匈牙利人民艰辛进行恢复工作
    负责恢复和建设工作的政府委员会决定成立
    越来越多的职工走上工作岗位，许多工厂积极准备恢复生产
    新华社布拉格15日电　布达佩斯消息：匈牙利工农革命政府11月12日举行会议，这次会议通过了一些重要的决定。
    政府指出，由于过去几天所采取的措施，对布达佩斯居民的物资供应已经大大地改善。目前在供应方面所存在的困难，首先是由于使铁路运输以及生产方面和商店中的工作难以进行的那种情况产生的。由于在其他各地负责供应工作的机构已经开始工作，因此对首都的物资供应可望在今后几天以来逐步改善。
    匈牙利政府着重表明，友好国家所供应的粮食和其他货品，对于匈牙利人民有极大的帮助。政府已经决定成立负责进行恢复和建设工作的政府委员会。
    匈牙利首都和其他各地的劳动人民正在艰苦地进行着恢复工作。工厂和机关的职工越来越多地走上了工作岗位。许多劳动者怀着悲愤的心情来修复被反革命分子破坏和摧毁的建筑物，单在布达佩斯就有二万五千多人参加了建筑单位的工作。
    在恢复工作的日子里，劳动人民永远忘不掉十多天前的暴乱时期反革命分子所造成的白色恐怖。布达佩斯的许多住宅都挂着哀悼战斗中牺牲的人的黑旗。劳动人民党区一级的二百多个共产党人所住的公寓房子的窗子上也悬挂了这种旗子；这些人和全家——妻子、孩子、父母，往往是被法西斯分子从四、五层楼上扔到街上的。许多人表现出忘我的热情，要以辛勤的劳动来治愈暴乱所造成的创伤。报纸登载了布达佩斯莫姆光学仪器工厂工人的来信，工人们坚决要求对反革命分子、怠工者和散布破坏性谣言的人采取坚决措施，以便更迅速地消灭反革命叛乱的后果。
    为了恢复正常的生产活动，匈牙利的工业企业正在设法克服主要是由于原料缺乏和运输力量不足所造成的困难。据匈牙利冶金和机器制造工业部新闻司的公告说，在许多冶金和机器制造厂中已经进行了恢复生产的准备工作。俄斯特工厂的一个翻砂厂至今在有限的规模上生产着，这个工厂的马丁炉只有一座恢复了正常的生产。在吉奥斯提厄的列宁钢铁厂，只有两座鼓风炉和一座马丁炉在生产，顺利的生产还因为原料和动力的缺乏而受到阻碍。在佐洛省，所有企业都已经恢复工作，但在那里生产也一样不能顺利进行。在塞格德的工厂中存在着同样的问题，例如那里的纺织工厂由于原料缺乏每天只工作四小时。在得布勒森的企业中，大约有70％的工人已经复工。那里供应很顺利。煤、玻璃和食盐正由罗马尼亚人民共和国源源运来。
    科马罗姆省宣布说，托托巴尼奥的矿工们在复工中也遭遇很多困难，因为某些工段矿场已经陷于荒芜的境地。矿工们在上工以后立即保证要供应托托巴尼奥的发电厂、医院、学校和面包房对煤炭的需要。
    新华社15日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：“真理报”14日刊载了它的驻布达佩斯记者克鲁辛斯基和马耶夫斯基的关于匈牙利情况的报道。
    他们报道说，目前匈牙利生活正在进入常轨。11月12日是布达佩斯大部分工业企业大规模恢复工作的一天。11月13日这一天也是由布达佩斯各工厂的清晨汽笛声开始的。粮食越来越多地运到城里来。据悉，苏联方面决定送给匈牙利人民的援助粮食几乎已经全部启运了。已经有七十六车皮食糖、二十三车皮面粉、四十车皮罐头牛奶、油脂、肉类和其他物品运到布达佩斯。还有三十一车皮食糖、二十一车皮面粉和其他食品运到了基付瓦尔多。大量的援助粮食正从欧洲人民民主国家和中华人民共和国运到匈牙利。
    记者还报道，目前正在采取措施以有效地捍卫劳动人民的劳动和安宁，以免遭受已被击溃的反革命势力残余分子的恐怖袭击。11月12日，布达佩斯成立了两个由志愿人员组成的公安团。
    记者们在报道中还指出，反革命阴谋积极参加者的真正面目日益明显地暴露出来。在反革命分子起事的时刻，布达佩斯出现了一位著名的反动人物——持有德意志联邦共和国护照到布达佩斯来的利温史太因亲王。利温史太因公开挑拨制造混乱。过了不久，杜克瓦尔特伯爵率领了一支五十四人的匪帮来到匈牙利。匪徒们伪装为医疗列车的工作人员渗入布达佩斯，而实际上却在指导反革命分子的进攻。原来潜伏着的以及从西德和奥地利赶回来的霍尔蒂军官手持武器指挥了对人民政权的进攻。
