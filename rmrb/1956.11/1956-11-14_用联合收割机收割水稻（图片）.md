Harvesting Rice with a Combine Harvester
　　The Hangu State Farm in Hebei Province has adopted the advanced Soviet experience of "appropriate close planting," and this year's rice growth is generally good. The picture shows a combine harvester harvesting rice. Using this combine harvester to harvest rice is twenty to thirty times faster than manual harvesting.

    用联合收割机收割水稻
  　河北国营汉沽农场采用苏联“适当密植”的先进经验，今年水稻生长普遍良好。图为联合收割机在收割水稻的情形。用这种收割机收割水稻比人工收割效率快二十到三十倍。	　薛德霖摄（国营汉沽农场供稿）
