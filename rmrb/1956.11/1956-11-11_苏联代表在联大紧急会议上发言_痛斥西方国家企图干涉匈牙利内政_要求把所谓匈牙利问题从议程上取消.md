Xinhua News Agency, New York, 10th dispatch: The United Nations General Assembly held an emergency meeting on the morning of November 9 to discuss the so-called Hungarian question.

The U.S. representative, Lodge, spoke first at the meeting. He stated directly that the United States "cannot tolerate" watching the insurgents it protected being defeated. He accused the Hungarian Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government of obstructing "aid to Hungary." He formally presented his new proposal regarding "United Nations aid to Hungary." This proposal slandered the Soviet Union for "interfering" with Western countries' food and medical aid to Hungary.

After the Pakistani representative made a brief speech in support of this proposal, the Soviet representative, Kuznetzov, spoke.

Kuznetzov emphasized that placing the so-called Hungarian situation on the agenda of the General Assembly was a violation of the United Nations Charter. The Hungarian government opposes the United Nations' discussion of the so-called Hungarian question, considering it interference in Hungary's internal affairs. Kuznetzov pointed out that the aims of those who want to discuss the so-called Hungarian question have nothing in common with the interests of the Hungarian people or the principles of the United Nations Charter. What some people are doing at the United Nations General Assembly is unprecedented in the history of the United Nations. The delegations of the United States, Britain, France, and some other countries are attempting to use the United Nations platform to instigate reactionary fascist groups to revolt against the Hungarian people's democratic system, attempting to incite reactionary forces that still dream of restoring the landlord-capitalist old system in Hungary. The reason why Western countries put the so-called Hungarian question on the agenda is also to divert world public opinion and prevent people from paying attention to the armed aggression against Egypt that they instigated.

Kuznetzov continued that since the establishment of the people's democratic system in Hungary, some people in the United States, Britain, and France have never given up their plans to restore the landlord-capitalist system in Hungary. However, all their attempts have failed. The Hungarian people have been and are firmly moving forward along the road of democratic development. The achievements made by Hungary and other people's democratic countries in socialist construction have aroused the hatred of reactionary groups. On the one hand, they are trying every means to subvert the people's democratic regime from within; on the other hand, they are adopting a policy of insulting and distorting the constructive and peaceful labor achievements of the people of these countries, attempting to slander the social and economic systems of these countries and their peaceful policies in front of the people of all countries.

Kuznetzov said that the representatives of the United States, Britain, France, and some other countries that support them have made incredible distortions and fabrications about the Hungarian events and the situation in the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries at this United Nations General Assembly meeting, attempting to use this method to confuse the member states of the United Nations.

When talking about the situation of the Hungarian events, Kuznetzov pointed out that the Hungarian working people, who have made great progress on the basis of the people's democratic system, have rightly raised the issue of the need to continue to progress, that is, to overcome the shortcomings in economic construction, further improve the material welfare of the residents, and eliminate the bureaucratic malpractices in state organs.

However, reactionary and counter-revolutionary forces mixed into this legitimate progressive movement of the working people, and they attempted to use the dissatisfaction of some working people to undermine the foundation of the Hungarian people's democratic system and restore the landlord-capitalist system.

Kuznetzov said that it is very clear that the reactionary forces supported by the United States, Britain, and France intend to eliminate all the democratic achievements of the Hungarian people and establish a fascist dictatorship in Hungary, and intend to turn Hungary into an outpost for anti-people's democratic countries activities and one of the hotbeds for provoking European wars.

If the counter-revolutionary coup succeeds, it will bring irreparable losses to the entire Hungarian nation, and the security of the people of European countries will be threatened. Only those who are trying to sharpen the international situation and provoke hostility between the people of all countries need to restore the old system in Hungary.

Kuznetzov continued that the rampant activities of the Hungarian reactionaries not only aroused the anxiety and concern of the honest patriots of Hungary, but also could not but arouse the anxiety and concern of the entire progressive mankind. The Hungarian people, led by democrats who withdrew from the Nagy cabinet, will not allow the overthrow of the people's democratic system, will not allow the wheel of history to turn back, and will not allow the old system of the capitalist-landlord class who hates the working people to be restored in Hungary. Now, the anti-people adventure in Hungary has been completely defeated.

Kuznetzov said that Western countries' delegations rely on the majority to unreasonably violate the United Nations Charter and rules of procedure in the Security Council and the United Nations General Assembly. Now, some people still want to deprive the representative of the Hungarian People's Republic of their rights, attempting to deprive the Hungarian people of their right to speak at the United Nations General Assembly, only because the Hungarian people bravely stood up against the reactionaries.

Kuznetzov said: The entire discussion of the so-called Hungarian question shows that those who raised this issue have another purpose. They are attempting to use this provocative method to divert world public opinion and prevent people from paying attention to the armed aggression against Egypt and the entire Middle East region launched by Britain, France, and Israel with the connivance of the United States. It cannot be concealed that the United States government has begun to embark on the path of openly instigating the aggressors who want to enslave the Egyptian people. In this regard, the United States government is nothing more than trying to use the current situation in the Middle East to achieve its own aggressive goals, trying to fish in troubled waters. Therefore, when the Soviet government proposed taking practical measures to stop the aggression against Egypt, the United States not only refused to support the proposal to immediately stop the aggression against Egypt, but also, together with the British and French delegations in the Security Council, obstructed the discussion of this proposal. What policy could be more hypocritical and more treacherous to the Egyptian people than this policy?

The Soviet representative continued that the representatives of the United States, Britain, and France, as well as some other representatives who spoke, tried to undermine the Soviet Union's firm implementation of the principle of peaceful coexistence of all countries in its foreign policy, and tried to slander the Soviet Union's position on the principles of the Bandung Conference and some other issues of Soviet domestic and foreign policy. This will not succeed. The Soviet Union has resolutely implemented a peaceful policy in the past and will continue to do so in the future, committed to easing international tensions, realizing the principle of peaceful coexistence, and striving wholeheartedly to maintain and consolidate peace. The Soviet people will always express respect and sympathy for the national liberation struggles of all countries for freedom, democratic rights, and national independence.

When talking about the issue of the Soviet army stationed in Hungary, Kuznetzov said that the Soviet army is stationed there in accordance with the Warsaw Treaty and at the request of the legitimate government of Hungary. The Hungarian government requested assistance in suppressing the dark forces of reaction and counter-revolution, restoring the people's socialist system, and restoring domestic order and tranquility. The Hungarian government also stated that after restoring order and tranquility in the country, it will hold negotiations with the Soviet Union and other contracting parties to the Warsaw Treaty to discuss the issue of the Soviet army stationed in Hungary. Therefore, the issue of the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Hungary is purely a matter within the power of the Hungarian government and the Soviet government.

The Soviet representative also emphasized that the issue of whether a regional agreement like the Warsaw Treaty exists or not is entirely within the power of the contracting parties to the Warsaw Treaty, and any attempt to treat this issue as an object of discussion by the United Nations is illegal and violates the United Nations Charter.

The Soviet representative said that the only demand now on the United Nations is to dispel the attempt to obstruct the Hungarian people from carrying out constructive and peaceful labor, and to reject the delusion of the United States, Britain, France, and some other countries to interfere in Hungary's internal affairs in order to rebuild the old capitalist system there.

Kuznetzov continued to talk about the proposals put forward by the representatives of Italy, Cuba, Peru, and other countries. This proposal slandered the Soviet Union for "interfering" in Hungary, demanding that Soviet troops immediately withdraw from Hungary; demanding that so-called "free elections" be held in Hungary under the supervision of the United Nations. Kuznetzov pointed out that this proposal is another attempt to deprive the Hungarian people of their legitimate right to conduct free and democratic elections without foreign interference. The Soviet representative went on to say that the remaining clauses of this proposal are also aimed at expanding and deepening interference in Hungary's internal affairs and with the aim of intensifying the slander of the Soviet Union and various socialist countries. Based on the above, the Soviet delegation opposes this proposal and will vote against it.

Turning to the proposal of the US delegation, Kuznetzov said: The Soviet government has decided to transport a large amount of food and other items to aid Hungary.

There are reports that the Hungarian People's Republic has also received assistance from the People's Republic of China, Czechoslovakia, Romania, and other people's democratic countries. Other governments and groups that intend to assist Hungary can easily find ways to directly contact the Hungarian government on this issue if they wish.

The proposal put forward by the US representative contains slanderous remarks against the Soviet Union and is intended to confuse the Hungarian people and world public opinion. Because of this, the Soviet delegation will vote against this proposal.

Kuznetzov concluded by saying that the objective evaluation of the events that occurred in Hungary convincingly proves that the so-called Hungarian question should be removed from the agenda of this meeting of the United Nations General Assembly, otherwise it will violate the United Nations Charter and damage the prestige of the United Nations. If an attempt is made to continue discussing this issue in the United Nations, then the intention is nothing more than to hope to support the Hungarian reactionary underground organizations and hinder the rapid rectification of Hungary's internal life under the leadership of the new government.

After Kuznetzov spoke, the representatives of France and Australia, as well as the Chiang Kai-shek elements, spoke, repeating the slanderous platitudes of the American representative.

    苏联代表在联大紧急会议上发言
    痛斥西方国家企图干涉匈牙利内政
    要求把所谓匈牙利问题从议程上取消
    新华社10日讯　纽约消息：联合国大会11月9日上午举行紧急会议，讨论所谓匈牙利问题。
    美国代表洛奇在会上第一个发言。他直接了当地说，美国“不能够容忍”看着它所庇护的暴动分子遭到失败。他指责匈牙利工农革命政府阻挠“对匈牙利的援助”。他正式地提出他的关于“联合国给予匈牙利援助”的新提案。这个提案污蔑苏联“干涉”西方国家对匈牙利的粮食和医药援助。
    在巴基斯坦代表作了支持这个提案的简短发言以后，苏联代表库兹?佐夫发言。
    库兹?佐夫强调指出，把所谓匈牙利局势问题列入大会议程是违反联合国宪章的。匈牙利政府反对联合国讨论所谓匈牙利问题，认为这是对匈牙利内政的干涉。库兹?佐夫指出，那些要讨论所谓匈牙利问题的人所抱的目的是同匈牙利人民的利益和联合国宪章的原则毫无共同之处的。一些人在联合国大会上的所作所为在联合国历史上是没有先例的。美、英、法和其他一些国家的代表团，企图利用联合国的讲坛唆使反动的法西斯集团进行反对匈牙利人民民主制度的暴动，企图煽动仍然幻想在匈牙利恢复地主—资本家旧制度的反动势力。西方国家所以把所谓匈牙利问题列入议程，还为了转移世界舆论的视线，使大家不去注意它们所策动的对埃及的武装侵略。
    库兹?佐夫接着说，自从在匈牙利建立了人民民主制度之后，美、英、法三国的某些人士一直没有放弃他们想在匈牙利使地主—资本家制度复辟的计划。但是，他们所有这些企图都失败了。匈牙利人民过去和现在都确定不移地沿着民主发展的道路前进。匈牙利和其他人民民主国家在社会主义建设中所获得的成就引起反动集团的憎恨。他们一方面企图不择手段地从内部颠复人民民主政权，另一方面，采取侮辱和歪曲这些国家人民的建设性和平劳动的成果的方针，企图在世界各国人民的面前污蔑这些国家的社会和经济制度，污蔑它们的和平政策。
    库兹?佐夫说，美、英、法和其他一些支持它们的国家的代表在这次联合国大会会议上对匈牙利事件以及对苏联和各人民民主国家的情况作了令人难以置信的歪曲和捏造，企图用这种办法来迷惑联合国的会员国。
    库兹?佐夫在谈到匈牙利事件的情况时指出，在人民民主制度基础上取得了巨大进步的匈牙利劳动人民正当地提出了必须继续进步的问题，即克服经济建设方面存在的缺点、进一步提高居民的物质福利、肃清国家机关中的官僚主义弊害。
    但是反动和反革命势力混进劳动人民的这一正当的进步的运动中来了，他们企图利用部分劳动人民的不满情绪来破坏匈牙利人民民主制度的基础和恢复地主—资本家制度。
    库兹?佐夫说，十分明显，得到美国、英国和法国支持的反动势力打算消灭匈牙利人民的一切民主成果和在匈牙利建立法西斯独裁政权，打算把匈牙利变成反人民民主国家活动的前哨，把匈牙利变成挑起欧洲战争的策源地之一。
    如果反革命的政变得以实现，那么就会给整个匈牙利民族带来不可挽回的损失，欧洲各国人民的安全就会受到威胁。只有那些极力使国际局势尖锐化和挑拨各国人民之间的敌意的人才需要在匈牙利恢复旧制度。
    库兹?佐夫接着说，匈牙利反动派的猖狂活动不但引起匈牙利正直的爱国者的不安和焦虑，而且也不能不引起整个进步人类的不安和焦虑。由退出纳吉内阁的民主人士所领导的匈牙利人民不容许推翻人民民主制度，不容许历史的车轮倒转，不容许仇视劳动人民的资本家—地主阶级的旧制度在匈牙利复辟。现在，匈牙利国内反人民的冒险已经遭到完全的失败。
    库兹?佐夫说，西方国家代表团依靠多数，在安全理事会中和联合国大会上无理地破坏联合国宪章和议事规则。现在，还有人想剥夺匈牙利人民共和国代表的权利，企图剥夺匈牙利人民在联合国大会上的发言权，原因只是由于匈牙利人民勇敢地起来反对反动派。
    库兹?佐夫说：对所谓匈牙利问题的整个讨论情况表明，提出这个问题的人还抱有另外一个目的。他们企图用这种挑衅方式来转移世界舆论的视线，使大家不去注意英国、法国和以色列在美国的纵容下对埃及和整个中东地区所发动的武装侵略。不能掩饰这样一个事实：美国政府已经开始走上公开怂恿想奴役埃及人民的侵略者的道路了。在这方面，美国政府无非是想利用中东现在造成的局势来达到自己的侵略目的，想混水摸鱼而已。因此，当苏联政府建议采取实际措施来制止对埃及的侵略行为的时候，美国不仅拒绝支持立即停止对埃及的侵略的建议，而且还在安全理事会同英国和法国代表团一道阻挠对这个建议的讨论。有什么政策能比这种政策对埃及人民更为口是心非，更为背信弃义呢？
    苏联代表接着说，美国、英国和法国代表以及其他一些发言的代表，力图损害苏联在外交政策上坚决执行的各国人民和平共处的原则，力图中伤苏联对万隆会议的原则和对苏联国内政策和外交政策的其他一些问题所采取的立场。这是不会成功的。苏联过去和今后都坚决执行和平政策，致力于缓和国际紧张局势，实现和平共处原则，全力为维护和巩固和平而奋斗。苏联人民对各国人民争取自由、民主权利和民族独立的民族解放斗争永远表示敬意和同情。
    库兹?佐夫在谈到苏联军队驻在匈牙利的问题的时候说，苏联军队是根据华沙条约和应匈牙利合法政府的请求而驻扎在那里的。匈牙利政府请求协助匈牙利人民压制反动和反革命的黑暗势力，恢复人民社会主义制度，恢复国内秩序和安宁。匈牙利政府也曾经声明，在国内恢复秩序和安宁之后，它将同苏联和华沙条约其他缔约国举行谈判，讨论苏联军队驻在匈牙利境内的问题。因此，苏联军队撤离匈牙利的问题纯粹是匈牙利政府和苏联政府权力范围内的事情。
    苏联代表还着重指出，关于像华沙条约这样的区域性的协定存在与否的问题，完全是华沙条约缔约国权力范围内的事，任何企图把这个问题当作联合国讨论的对象的做法都是不合法的，都是违反联合国宪章的。
    苏联代表说，现在对联合国的唯一的要求是：打消想阻挠匈牙利人民进行建设性和平劳动的企图，拒绝美、英、法和其他一些国家企图干涉匈牙利内政以求在那里重建资本主义旧制度的妄想。
    库兹?佐夫接着谈到意大利、古巴、秘鲁和其他国家的代表提出的提案，这个提案污蔑苏联对匈牙利“干涉”，要求苏联军队立即撤出匈牙利；要求在联合国监督下在匈牙利举行所谓“自由选举”。库兹?佐夫指出，这个提案是企图剥夺匈牙利人民在不受外来干涉的情况下进行自由民主选举的合法权利的再一次尝试。苏联代表接着说，这个提案的其余条文也是指望扩大和加深对匈牙利内政的干涉和抱着加紧诽谤苏联和各社会主义国家的目的。根据上述情况，苏联代表团反对这个提案，并且将对它投反对票。
    库兹?佐夫在转而谈到美国代表团的提案时说：苏联政府已经决定运送大量粮食和其他物品去援助匈牙利。
    有消息说，匈牙利人民共和国还得到中华人民共和国、捷克斯洛伐克、罗马尼亚和其他人民民主国家的援助。其他打算援助匈牙利的政府和团体，如果愿意的话，也可以很容易地找到途径就这一问题同匈牙利政府直接进行接触。
    美国代表提出的提案包含着诽谤苏联的言论，其目的在于迷惑匈牙利人民和世界舆论。由于这一点，苏联代表团对这一提案将投反对票。
    库兹?佐夫最后说，对匈牙利所发生的事件所作的客观评价令人信服地证明，所谓匈牙利问题应该从联合国大会这次会议的议程上取消，否则是违反联合国宪章和有损联合国威信的。如果企图继续在联合国讨论这一问题，那末，其用意无非是希望支持匈牙利的反动地下组织和阻挠在新政府领导下实行的匈牙利内部生活的迅速的整顿。
    在库兹?佐夫发言之后，法国和澳大利亚的代表以及蒋介石分子发言，他们重弹美国代表的毁谤性的滥调。
