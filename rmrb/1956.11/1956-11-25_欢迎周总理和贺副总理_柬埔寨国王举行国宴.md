Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, November 23rd (delayed dispatch) On the evening of the 22nd, King Suramarit and Queen hosted a state banquet at the Khemarin Palace, illuminated by thousands of electric lights, to entertain Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier He Long, and other members of the delegation.

N. Das, and diplomatic officials from Britain, France, and other countries.

The banquet proceeded in an extremely friendly atmosphere until 11:30 PM. During the banquet, both the King and the Premier rose to toast the health of the leaders of both countries and the prosperity of the two peoples.

King Suramarit began his speech by expressing his respect for the Premier. He said there were two reasons for respecting Zhou Enlai: first, as the representative of the Chinese people, the Premier brought friendly feelings that link the two countries together. Secondly, "He is the dearest friend of our Crown Prince."

The King continued, "I believe this friendship between the leaders of the two countries is a most precious omen. It will enhance the prosperity of both countries and world peace."

The King asked Zhou Enlai to convey his blessings to Chairman Mao Zedong and the Chinese people, and wished the Premier a successful visit.

In his reply, Premier Zhou Enlai, on behalf of Chairman Mao Zedong and the Chinese government, extended his high respect and sincere greetings to His Majesty the King and Queen. He thanked the King, Queen, Prince Sihanouk, and the people of Phnom Penh for the grand welcome extended to him and the delegation. He said, "We believe that this unforgettable friendship is the great friendship of His Majesty the King and Queen and the Cambodian people towards our people."

Zhou Enlai continued, saying that Prince Sihanouk had stated that Cambodia and China had established contact and blood ties in history long ago. The Premier expressed the desire for the two countries to live in peace forever. He concluded by saying, "May our people live in friendship for generations to come."

During the banquet, the palace orchestra played light music outside the spacious dining hall. The orchestra played pieces written by the King and Prince Sihanouk.

After the banquet, the King, Queen, and guests went to the Royal Stage to watch classical Khmer dances.

The ceiling of this huge stage was painted with images of Buddha, archers, dancers, and elephants. Dancers wearing glittering clothes and gold ornaments danced barefoot on the magnificent carpet in the center of the hall, to the delight of the surrounding audience. The stage opened on three sides to the outside, allowing air to circulate and reduce the tropical heat, and offering a view of the magnificent palace, its yellow roof and golden spires radiating under the lights. The dance ended at 1:30 AM on the 23rd.
