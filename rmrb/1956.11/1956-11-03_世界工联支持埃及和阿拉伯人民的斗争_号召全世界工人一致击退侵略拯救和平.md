    Xinhua News Agency, Prague, November 2nd. The World Federation of Trade Unions issued an appeal to workers and trade union organizations in all countries on November 1st, stating that the aggression against Egypt is an aggression against all Arab people and a violation of world peace.
    The armed intervention by Britain, France, and Israel aims to restore the privileges previously enjoyed by the wealthy shareholders of the Suez Canal. Its purpose is to undermine the movement of people in various countries to fight for national independence.
    The World Federation of Trade Unions strongly condemns this shameful act of war by Britain, France, and Israel. The interests of workers and the interests of peace urgently demand an immediate cessation of hostilities, the withdrawal of foreign troops from Egypt, and respect for the United Nations Charter.
    The appeal concludes by saying that the World Federation of Trade Unions calls on workers and trade union organizations around the world to unite with all their strength, strengthen their united protest, and take joint action to repel aggression and save peace.

    世界工联支持埃及和阿拉伯人民的斗争
    号召全世界工人一致击退侵略拯救和平
    新华社布拉格2日电　世界工会联合会1日向所有国家的工人和工会组织发出呼吁书说，对于埃及的侵略就是对于全体阿拉伯人民的侵略和对世界和平的侵犯。
    英国、法国和以色列进行的武装干涉，其目的在于恢复苏伊士运河的豪富股东们以前所享有的特权。它的目的在于破坏各国人民争取民族独立的运动。
    世界工联猛烈地谴责英国、法国和以色列所采取的这种可耻的战争行为。工人的利益和和平的利益都迫切要求立即停止敌对行动，从埃及撤出外国军队和尊重联合国宪章。
    呼吁书最后说，世界工联要求全世界的工人和工会组织尽自己所有的力量团结起来，加强他们一致抗议的力量，采取共同行动来击退侵略和拯救和平。
