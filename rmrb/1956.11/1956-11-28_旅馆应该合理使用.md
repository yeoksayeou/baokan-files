Hotels Should Be Used Rationally
Commentator of this newspaper

We have been receiving letters from readers reflecting the lack of lodging for travelers. Some newspapers have already proposed solutions to this problem, and some localities are beginning to address it. However, judging from recent letters from readers, this problem is far from being resolved nationwide.

One important reason why this problem cannot be quickly resolved is the objective difficulties. The country is undergoing large-scale economic construction, political, economic, and cultural ties are becoming closer across the country, transportation is becoming more convenient, and the number of travelers is increasing significantly. Under these circumstances, although some regions have built more hotels, the number built is far from meeting the actual needs. This objective difficulty cannot be overcome in the short term.

However, the reason why this problem has not been resolved quickly is also because the leadership in some areas has not really cared about this matter, so that some unreasonable phenomena have been able to exist for a long time. For example, the phenomenon of government departments and military units long-term chartering hotels is serious. Among the more than 500 joint state-private hotels in Beijing, 30% of the rooms (accommodating 4,000 people) are long-term chartered. In Shanghai, 18% of the beds in ordinary hotels (accommodating about 2,000 people) are long-term chartered. However, these long-term chartered hotels are not being fully utilized. In Beijing and Shanghai, the utilization rate of chartered hotels is only 40% to 60%. The large amount of rent paid by the state every year is far greater than the value of these chartered properties. What a huge waste! There are also many guesthouses in various places that have not been properly utilized. If the People's Committees and urban service departments of various regions can manage these hotels and guesthouses and make appropriate adjustments, the problem of travelers finding lodging can be largely solved. According to statistics, if the chartered hotels in Beijing and Shanghai can be vacated, they can almost accommodate the transient travelers in these two cities. A military unit in Beijing appropriately adjusted its guesthouse and freed up two chartered hotels.

Some unreasonable systems and business practices of the traveler service departments have also contributed to the shortage of hotels. Reader Zhang Hengxiang wrote that he arrived in Anshan on October 24th and searched all the hotels in the Tie Dong and Tie Xi districts, all of which had "full" signs. After repeated requests, the "Oriental Hotel" accommodated him. When he entered the hotel, he immediately found that there were four empty beds in the room. According to his understanding, this hotel does not remove the "full" sign from morning to night every day, and refuses travelers regardless of whether there are rooms or not. The systems of the Shenyang Hotel Liaison Station and hotels in Lanzhou and other places published in today's newspaper urgently need to be improved.

The hotel shortage is also related to the bureaucratic work style of some leading organs. Some organs call meetings and require participants to arrive early. Some people stay idly in hotels, doing nothing all day long. Some organs charter hotels during meetings, but few representatives stay there, and many staff members stay there, which should also be changed.

    旅馆应该合理使用
    本报评论员
    不断有读者来信反映旅客没有地方投宿。有些报纸已经提出解决这个问题的意见，有些地方正在着手解决这个问题。可是，从最近的读者来信看，在全国范围内，这个问题还远远没有得到解决。
    这个问题所以不能迅速得到解决，一个重要的原因，是客观上有困难。国家正在进行大规模的经济建设，全国各地政治、经济、文化联系日益密切，交通越来越方便，旅客大量地增加；在这种情况下面，有的地区虽然增建了一些旅馆，但增建的数目远远不能满足实际的需要。这个客观困难，短期内还是不能克服的。
    不过，这个问题所以没有能够迅速解决，还因为有些地区的领导方面并没有真正关心这件事，以致某些不合理的现象得以长期存在。比如，机关部队长期包租旅馆的现象是严重的。北京市五百多户公私合营旅馆中，有30％的客房（能容四千人）被长期包租；上海市的普通旅馆中，有18％的床位（约容二千人）被长期包租。可是，这种长期包租的旅馆，并未被充分地利用。北京、上海两地包租的旅馆，使用率仅有40％到60％；国家每年付出的大量租金，远远大于这些包租房产的价值。这是多大的浪费！各地还有不少招待所，也没有好好地利用。如果各个地区的人民委员会和城市服务部能把这些旅馆和招待所管起来，加以适当的调整，旅客投宿问题在很大程度上是可以解决的。据统计，北京、上海两市的包租旅馆如果能够让出来，差不多可以容纳这两个城市的过往旅客。北京市有个军事机关把自己的招待所适当地调整了一下，就腾出了两所包租旅馆。
    旅客服务部门一些不合理的制度和经营作风，也助长了旅馆的紧张现象。读者张恒祥来信说：他在10月24日到鞍山，找遍了铁东、铁西两区的旅馆，都挂着“客满”的牌子。经他再三请求，“东方旅社”收留了他。他进了旅馆，立刻发现房内还有四个空床位。据他了解，这家旅馆每天从早到晚都不拿掉“客满”牌子，旅客来问，不管有无房间，一律谢绝。今天本报发表的沈阳旅店联络站和兰州等地旅馆的制度，都亟应改进。
    旅馆紧张还和某些领导机关的官僚主义作风有关系。有些机关召集会议，要求参加会的人提前到达。有些人闲住旅馆中，终日无所事事。有些机关在开会期间包租旅馆，代表住的不多，工作人员住的不少，这也是应该改变的。
