Comrades! Thirty-nine years ago, our working class, in alliance with the laboring peasants and under the leadership of the Communist Party, eliminated the hateful system of exploiters and established the world's first Soviet socialist state.

On the second day after the victory of the Great October Socialist Revolution, the leader of the revolution, Vladimir Ilyich Lenin, said: "From now on, a new era begins in Russian history, and this third Russian revolution will finally lead to the victory of socialism."
(Lenin's Complete Works, Volume 26, Page 208).

Lenin's prediction has come true. On the road paved by the October Revolution, socialism has long achieved a final and irreversible victory in our country.

Under the incomparably difficult conditions of a formerly economically backward country, under the stubborn resistance of the overthrown exploiting classes, and in the environment of capitalist encirclement and the frantic struggle of international imperialism against the first socialist country, the Soviet laboring people, in a relatively short historical period, realized the socialist transformation of society, eliminated the private ownership of the means of production, and forever eradicated the phenomenon of man exploiting man. The Soviet Union has become a powerful world socialist power, a country with a mighty industry, advanced agriculture, advanced culture, and socialist democracy.

The October Socialist Revolution is the greatest event in world history. It declared to the world the arrival of a new era, an era of liberating mankind from all forms of social and national oppression, from wars and bloody hostility between countries, an era of establishing truly human relations between people and creating the conditions necessary for human existence.

The October Socialist Revolution is a natural result of the entire development of previous Russian and world history, and at the same time, it powerfully promoted the development of world events, accelerated the resolution of urgent problems in historical development, so that the world has fundamentally changed in one generation. The people of many European and Asian countries have embarked on the road of socialism. A powerful socialist world system, uniting approximately one billion people, has been established and is constantly strengthening.

All countries embarking on the path of socialist development have widely applied the basic principles derived from the revolutionary process in our country and practically tested in the development of the Soviet state. The practice of the world communist movement and socialist construction in the people's democracies has confirmed Lenin's instruction: "The significance of certain basic features of our revolution is not local, not nationally specific, not unique to Russia, but international." (Lenin's Complete Works, Volume 31, Page 5).

Historical experience shows that the victory of the socialist revolution and the establishment of a new society on a socialist basis have the following common features and regularities:

First, the establishment of working-class political power led by the vanguard of the working class; second, striving to strengthen the alliance of the working class with the peasantry and other strata of the laboring people; third, the elimination of capitalist private ownership of industrial enterprises, banks, transportation, and postal and telecommunications services, the establishment of public ownership of the basic means of production, and the implementation of a planned economy; fourth, resolutely defending the achievements of the socialist revolution from the infringement of the previously exploiting ruling classes.

These common features and regularities do not exclude, and must not exclude, that the ways and means by which the working class obtains political power, the speed of public ownership of the basic means of production, the speed of carrying out other socialist transformations, and the forms of socialist democracy in each country moving towards socialism vary according to the specific conditions of each country's development. Every country can make its own contribution to the theory and practice of socialism, thereby proving the creativity of Marxism-Leninism. The people's democratic countries have accumulated rich experience in building socialism during these years. Therefore, it is necessary to carefully study this experience and exchange it among the various socialist countries on the basis of the principles of equality and proletarian internationalism.

The great victory of socialism in the Soviet Union, the establishment of socialism as a world system, the ongoing collapse of the imperialist colonial system, and the severe weakening of the forces of world capitalism have greatly changed and improved the conditions and forms of struggle for advanced progressive forces in all countries to transform human society on a new social basis.

Looking around the countries of the socialist family, the Soviet laboring people are pleased because many countries and peoples are engaged in the socialist cause, the development of socialist forces throughout the world is accelerating, and the great ideas of the October Revolution are opening up paths for themselves on an increasingly broader scale. As true internationalists, the Soviet people are satisfied to see the historic victories achieved by the great Chinese people and the people of fraternal people's democratic countries in socialist construction.

We are celebrating the thirty-ninth anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution in such an environment: that is, all of our people, our heroic working class, our glorious collective farmers, and our outstanding Soviet intellectuals are working tirelessly to realize the historic resolutions of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

The 20th Congress of the CPSU has not been closed for long, but remarkable achievements have already been obtained, of which the Soviet people have the right to be proud.

(II)

In our struggle to build communism, 1956 is a year of great significance. The nationwide socialist competition widely launched in urban and rural areas to complete the Sixth Five-Year Plan has produced remarkable results in all sectors of our national economy and has brought about significant improvements in the material lives of the Soviet laboring people.

Our industry is victoriously implementing the program for expanding socialist reproduction adopted by the 20th Party Congress. From January to October 1956, the total industrial output plan was completed by 102%.

Our Party and the entire Soviet people are focusing their efforts primarily on ensuring the priority development of the production of means of production. The mainstay of the Soviet economy and the foundation for the smooth development of the entire national economy—the various sectors of heavy industry—are on the rise. The output of industrial sectors producing means of production in the first ten months of this year increased by more than 11% compared with the same period last year.

We have particularly significant growth in the production of tools. This year, the output of the machinery manufacturing and metal processing industries will increase by 12%, increasing to five times that of 1940. The development we have achieved in machinery manufacturing is a reliable foundation for ensuring the continuous rise of the national economy.

In 1956, the Soviet Union will refine 49 million tons of steel, mine 430 million tons of coal, 84 million tons of oil, and produce 192 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity. Compared with pre-revolutionary Russia, the Soviet Union has increased its steel refining by eleven times, oil extraction by nine times, coal by fifteen times, and electricity production by almost one hundred times.

The total industrial output of the Soviet Union is now thirty times that of 1913.

These figures reflect the historical fact that the Soviet Union has become a great industrial power. These figures clearly demonstrate that the October Socialist Revolution has opened up infinitely broad scope for the development of our country's productive forces, and that the creative and constructive labor of the Soviet people, who took their destiny into their own hands in October 1917, is of great magnitude.

The speed of our industrial development far exceeds the speed of industrial development in major capitalist countries. In 1956, the Soviet Union's steel production will increase tenfold compared to 1929, while the United States' steel production will only increase 1.8 times during this period. The Soviet Union's oil production will increase sixfold during this period, while the United States' oil production will only increase 2.5 times; the Soviet Union's electricity production will increase thirty-one times, while the United States'—six times. In terms of the absolute production volume of steel, oil, and electricity, the Soviet Union still lags far behind the United States. However, our superiority in development speed can confidently guarantee that we will eliminate this backwardness in the shortest historical period.

The superiority of the socialist economic system over the capitalist economic system is becoming more and more apparent year by year. In the competition between the two systems, victory absolutely and completely belongs to the socialist side. All Soviet people deeply believe in the correctness of the great Lenin, who said in one of his later speeches: "We will also definitely be able to do it: catch up with them at a speed that other countries cannot even dream of."

The conditions for expanding the production of consumer goods are being established on the basis of the priority growth of the production of the means of production and the development of our country's agriculture. In the first ten months of this year, the output of the light industry and food industry sectors increased by 10%, the variety of products increased, and the quality of products improved.

Socialist industry can justifiably be proud of its tremendous achievements. However, these achievements could have been even greater if all our possible conditions and reserves were utilized more fully and better, and if the work of all industrial sectors were equally good. On the other hand, some heavy industrial sectors lagged behind in completing the state plan in 1956. These are the Donbass coal mining industry, the ferrous metallurgy industry, and the cement and forestry industries. This has created a certain degree of difficulty in supplying the national economy with the required coal, metal, cement, and timber. Overcoming the backwardness of these industrial sectors should be regarded as a top priority task of great significance to the country.

The staff in Soviet industry should take all measures to complete state tasks and plans on time, improve enterprise leadership methods, and resolutely strive for further technological progress, innovation, and improvement of production equipment.

Our country is confidently entering a new era of scientific and technological industrial revolution, the emergence of which is primarily due to the discovery of methods for utilizing atomic energy. As everyone knows, our industrial atomic power station has been operating smoothly for more than two years, and we are actively engaged in preparing to build some new and larger atomic power stations, and we are building icebreakers using atomic energy engines. Radioactive isotopes are being used more and more widely in our industry, agriculture, medicine, science, and technology.

The development of science and technology has been reflected in many industrial sectors. In the steelmaking and ironmaking industries, oxygen-enriched blasting is widely used. Many steel plants are organizing continuous casting. Advanced machine manufacturing enterprises are promoting precision casting, precision forging, and slag electric welding. The oil extraction industry continues to promote maintaining oil layer pressure and secondary oil extraction using edge water displacement. The chemical industry is developing the production of substitutes for certain agricultural products, the quality of which is no less than natural products. Many enterprises are promoting comprehensive mechanization and automation of production.

Under the socialist system, social production can maximize the utilization of all the achievements of modern science and technology. However, we still have some people, some large and small production leaders, who do not fully understand that the struggle to strive for technological progress and to rapidly promote new technologies in production is one of the most important tasks in our construction of a communist society. Not all industrial sectors and enterprises have achieved the achievements they should have in utilizing modern scientific and technological achievements. In particular, enterprises under the Ministry of Nonferrous Metals Industry, the Ministry of Chemical Industry, the Ministry of Coal Industry, and the Ministry of Agricultural Machinery Manufacturing have serious shortcomings in this regard.

The Communist Party believes that the struggle for technological progress is of decisive significance, and therefore requires all workers in the national economy to increase their sense of responsibility for mastering new technologies, to make fuller use of advanced working methods and techniques, and to be concerned about the suggestions of our vast number of rationalization proponents and inventors. Only by widely utilizing all the achievements of domestic and world science and technology can we quickly increase labor productivity, develop industry, agriculture, and transportation, consolidate national defense, and increase the production of consumer goods.

Comrades! 1956 in our country's history is not only a year of great new achievements in industry, but also a year of comprehensive and great rise in agriculture. Although a large part of the winter crops in the southern regions were damaged by frost, spring came too late, and autumn was rainy, the harvest of collective farms and state farms this year still broke the highest record in our country's history. Since the Soviet regime, the state has never purchased so much grain as this year. The grain purchased this year is more than one billion poods more than last year.

This outstanding victory on the production front and in grain procurement is the merit of our glorious entire Soviet people, who selflessly fulfilled the huge tasks put forward by the Party for agriculture.

The Communist Party has always attached great importance to the struggle to produce more grain, considering this struggle to be a very important component of the entire socialist struggle. Today, if we evaluate the achievements of this struggle, we have the right to say that the Party has not only put forward the slogan of producing enough agricultural products, but also found the correct practical path to realize this grand task. The reason why we have been able to achieve remarkable achievements in the struggle to produce more grain is because collective farms and state farms have been further consolidated and the Soviet government has given great assistance to agriculture.

In the past three years alone, socialist industry has supplied agriculture with 650,000 tractors (each calculated at 15 horsepower), 142,000 grain combine harvesters, 345,000 freight trucks, and many other machines.

Following the great Lenin's instructions on the great significance of the individual material interests of the laboring people for the development of production, the Party and the government have tried to increase the material benefits obtained by collective farms and collective farmers when increasing the production of agricultural products, greatly increasing the purchasing and procurement prices of grain, potatoes, vegetables, cotton, beets, other agricultural crops, and livestock products, thereby transforming material incentives into a huge force for developing production. The decisions made by the Party and the government on the new system of agricultural planning work, on the monthly advance of labor remuneration to collective farmers, and on the right of collective farmers to revise, supplement, and change the articles of association of agricultural labor cooperatives on their own initiative are of great significance for enhancing the production enthusiasm of collective farmers and for more rationally managing the public economy of collective farms.

Among all the huge measures taken by the Party and the government to improve agricultural production, the reclamation of wasteland in Kazakhstan, Siberia, and the Urals is particularly important. Hundreds of thousands of Soviet people warmly responded to the call to complete the task of reclaiming 28 million to 30 million hectares of new land in 1956 as proposed by the government. A large number of modern machines have been allocated for this purpose. Up to now, 35.5 million hectares of wasteland have actually been reclaimed. This is almost equal to 1.7 times the total area of grain crops planted in the United Kingdom, Italy, and France. It is very clear that only socialist countries and socialist agriculture can complete such a huge task in a short period of time.

Our Party's policy of reclaiming wasteland has proven to be completely correct. Now everyone is already clear about how huge the significance of reclaiming wasteland is for the production of grain, especially for the production of marketable grain. For example, before the reclamation of wasteland, Kazakhstan, Siberia, and the Urals could only hand over about 600 million poods of grain to the state even in years with better harvests. However, in 1956, the state procured more than 2 billion poods of grain in these regions. At the same time, in the past three years, the grain procured by the state in the Kazakh Republic has increased sevenfold.

All the Soviet people participated in the work of reclaiming virgin land and fallow land. Hundreds of thousands of male and female workers, collective farmers, engineering and technical personnel, and agricultural experts volunteered to go to reclaim wasteland, setting a true example of heroism in labor. Our heroic Communist Youth League and the glorious Soviet youth have made a significant contribution to reclaiming wasteland. More than 350,000 members of the Communist Youth League and youth migrated to the reclamation areas in response to the call of the Communist Youth League. During this year's harvest work, city residents, school students, and Soviet soldiers gave great assistance to collective farms and state farms. The organizational work of the Party, the Soviets, the Communist Youth League, and trade union organizations, as well as agricultural agencies, played a significant role.

On behalf of the Central Committee of the Party and the Soviet government, please allow me to express my deep gratitude from this platform to all the patriots who actively participated in the historic campaign to reclaim wasteland!

This year, socialist agriculture has not only made great strides in increasing grain production. The output and procurement volume of important crops such as beets, cotton, potatoes, and vegetables have also greatly increased. For example, the procurement volume of beets is 5 million tons more than in the corresponding period last year. The procurement volume of potatoes this year has increased to more than one and a half times that of last year. The procurement volume of cotton and vegetables has also greatly exceeded last year's level.

We are pleased with the achievements we have made in developing animal husbandry, especially in improving the productivity of livestock products. On this basis, the output and procurement volume of meat, meat products, eggs, and especially milk have increased this year. For example, the procurement and purchase volume of milk is 30% more than last year.

It can be seen that the efforts of the Party, the government, and the entire Soviet people to produce enough marketable grain for residents and enough agricultural raw materials for industry in the shortest possible period have achieved very good results.

Socialist agriculture possesses truly endless potential for further expanding the production of grain, meat, milk, wool, and other agricultural products. There is no doubt that collective farmers, workers of machine tractor stations and state farms, agricultural experts, Communists and members of the Communist Youth League in our rural areas, and Party and Soviet organizations will make the greatest efforts to rely on advanced experience, modern technology, and the latest discoveries in agricultural science to utilize these potentials and achieve more outstanding achievements.

1956 is marked by a huge improvement in the material and cultural living standards of the laboring people. Some measures that conform to the interests of the entire people have been taken this year, such as shortening working hours on the day before holidays and festivals, stipulating that teenagers aged 16 to 18 work six hours a day, increasing pensions and disability allowances for the laboring people, abolishing tuition fees for middle schools and universities, and increasing maternity leave, so that any worker's family and any Soviet employee's family can personally experience the good effects produced by these measures. From the New Year, low-wage employees will increase their wages. And preparatory measures are being implemented so that from 1957, employees' working days will be gradually changed to 7 hours.

The material welfare of collective farmers has also been greatly improved, because the income of collective farms has doubled in the past three years due to the development of the public economy of collective farms. This year, collective farms and collective farmers can obtain 20 billion rubles more than last year from the agricultural products sold and sold to the state.

The living standards of the Soviet people are constantly improving. The budget survey materials systematically conducted by the Central Statistical Bureau can particularly clearly illustrate this point. From these materials, it can be seen that compared with the pre-war 1940, the amount of textiles purchased by workers' families in 1956 increased by an average of 94%, of which wool fabrics increased by about three times, and leather shoes increased by 83%. In collective farmers' families, the amount of textiles purchased per capita in 1956 was more than twice that of 1940, of which wool fabrics increased by three and a half times and leather shoes increased by 95%.

In employees' families, the consumption of products such as meat and fat per person increased by 62% compared with pre-war, fish and fish products increased by 92%, milk and dairy products increased more than twofold, eggs increased by 86%, and sugar increased by 87%.

In collective farmers' families, the consumption of meat and fat per capita increased by 54%, fish and fish products increased more than twofold, milk and dairy products increased by 47%, eggs increased more than twofold, and sugar increased by 3.6 times. The production of cultural goods and daily necessities has increased a lot. This year alone, we will produce about 23 million clocks and watches and more than 4 million radios and televisions.

The Soviet people have begun to eat better, dress better, and live more culturally. Meeting the dramatically increasing needs of the laboring people for industrial products and food as fully as possible is one of the most important concerns of our country. Necessary measures have now been taken to increase the production of consumer goods, improve quality, and improve the trade situation in the Soviet Union.

Improving living conditions is of great significance for improving the material and cultural living standards of the laboring people. In 1956, a total area of 36 million square meters of new housing will be used in cities and workers' towns, a figure equal to the total residential area of Kiev, Baku, Kharkov, Gorky, Sverdlovsk, and Chelyabinsk. But we are not satisfied with the existing speed and scale of housing construction. The housing problem is still very acute. The Party and the Soviet government are now paying great attention to this issue.

The culture of the Soviet people is flourishing. We have long implemented seven-year universal education, and are now taking steps to basically implement universal secondary education in urban and rural areas during the Sixth Five-Year Plan. Broad opportunities have been created for the laboring people to receive higher education.

Currently, about 4 million people, both full-time and part-time, are studying in various universities and technical colleges. There are almost 2 million Soviet university students, a figure equal to more than twice the total number of university students in European capitalist countries.

In the achievements made in cultural construction and in the rise of material production, the Soviet intellectuals have played an important and glorious role. Our engineers and technicians, agronomists, doctors, teachers, scientists, writers, and artists are all actively helping the people complete the tasks of economic and cultural construction. Our Party and the entire Soviet people highly evaluate the noble labor of their intellectuals. The love and respect of the people encourage Soviet intellectuals to make new creative efforts and strengthen the loyalty of Soviet intellectuals to the cause of communism.

The increase in the life expectancy of the people is an important sign of the growth in the material and cultural living standards of our people. The average life expectancy of the people in pre-revolutionary Russia was only 32 years. By 1927, the average life expectancy had increased to 44 years, and now the average life expectancy of the people is already 64 years. This means that in our Soviet era, people live better. Comrades! After greatly increasing pensions for the elderly and with the material conditions of the laboring people improving day by day, we can now hope that the life expectancy of the Soviet people will greatly increase. As Mayakovsky wrote:

	We can
		live to be a hundred years old
	and
	never grow old.

Needless to say, the Communist Party sees that in all aspects directly related to the vital interests of the people—in housing construction, in the production of industrial products and food, in the organization of trade, and in cultural life services for residents—we still have many serious shortcomings and tasks that have not yet been resolved. The Party and the government will continue to work hard in the future to continuously improve the living standards of the laboring people on the basis of developing the socialist economy and improving labor productivity. Making the lives of the Soviet people happy—this is the main goal of all the activities of our Party and government.

(III)

Comrades! The achievements of our country's industry and agriculture, the improvement of the people's material welfare, and the development of Soviet culture—all of this proves the strong strength and strength of the Soviet social system and state system, and the extremely great superiority of our Soviet democracy.

The Soviet democracy produced by the October Revolution is a new type of democracy. Different from the hypocritical and incomplete democracy of capitalist countries, the democracy of the rich, Soviet socialist democracy is the democracy of the laboring people, the democracy of the people.

The profound democratic nature of the Soviet system lies in the fact that here, the policies of the state are based on the interests and will of the various laboring classes, and these laboring classes are the most oppressed under the capitalist system, and the interests of the bourgeois parliament and government are the least considered.

The Soviet system absorbs millions of people who would actually be excluded from political life in bourgeois countries to participate in political life and participate in the management of the country. For example, hundreds of millions of citizens of all our nationalities regularly participate in the work of the Soviets, working in the many committees and other democratic institutions belonging to the Soviets. More than 1.5 million people have been elected to the local Soviets of Laboring People's Deputies alone.

Socialist democracy, as a truly people-led system, provides all the conditions for every Soviet person to improve their awareness and for every Soviet person to strengthen their sense of ownership of the country. At the same time, Soviet socialist democracy guarantees all members of society the right to work, the right to education, and the right to rest, and guarantees the realization of these rights, which creates all the conditions for the continuous material and spiritual progress of society and for the all-round development of everyone's talents and abilities.

All of this does not mean that we have no shortcomings in the practice of Soviet democratic principles, and that the work of our state organs is beyond reproach. The Party does not deceive itself on this point.

In recent years, we have vigorously streamlined administrative management agencies, expanded the powers of the Soviet agencies of the Union republics and local levels, and eliminated excessive centralization, especially excessive centralization in agricultural planning.

However, our state organs are still very large, and some people among the staff of the organs still commit bureaucracy and red tape, and are divorced from the reality of life and the people. Apart from official documents, they can no longer see anything or anyone.

It is necessary to constantly improve the work of state organs, it is necessary to base the work of the Soviets on the active participation of all representatives and their close ties with voters, it is necessary to resolutely and ruthlessly oppose bureaucracy and red tape, and to find new ways and new avenues for further developing the creative initiative of the laboring people and for workers, engineers, and employees to more effectively and directly participate in the management of enterprises and economic organizations. It is also necessary to vigorously promote and strengthen collective farm democracy in rural areas, ensure strict compliance with the articles of association of agricultural labor cooperatives everywhere, and eliminate the detailed intervention of local organizations in collective farms.

After the 20th Congress of the Communist Party, the initiative of the laboring people and their fervent concern for various state affairs have grown more and more. The overcoming of the consequences of the personality cult has begun to fully achieve positive results.

As everyone knows, the personality cult is associated with the name of J. V. Stalin. Stalin's merits and role in the October Revolution, socialist construction, and the struggle against the enemies of the working class are well known. Stalin was a great organizer and a great Marxist. However, the personality cult of Stalin produced serious mistakes and many facts that violated socialist legality. The personality cult is incompatible with Marxism-Leninism and incompatible with the socialist social system, and therefore it has been resolutely condemned by our Party.

Now, the Leninist norms of Party life and the principles of Soviet socialist democracy have been restored, and collective leadership is being realized within the Party, so the creative initiative of the Party masses and the entire Soviet people is constantly improving, the work of the Party and the work of the Soviets has been greatly enlivened, and Party and non-Party staff have begun to be more courageous in criticizing shortcomings and more actively fighting against shortcomings. The entire Soviet people are more closely united around their beloved Communist Party.

Further strengthening close ties with the laboring masses is the Party's urgent task. The Party requires Party and Soviet staff and all Communists to focus their main attention and energy on concrete and vibrant work, and requires them to go deep into the lives of the true creators of history and the true builders of communism—workers, collective farmers, and intellectuals.

Our Party believes that strengthening close ties with the people is the most important condition for further consolidating our socialist country and victoriously marching towards communism.

The unity of the Soviet people is a great achievement of socialism. The entire process of social development has confirmed the correctness of Lenin's saying that private property separates people and socialism unites people. The fraternal friendship and cooperation between workers, intellectuals, and collective farmers, and the fraternal friendship and cooperation between the various nationalities of our country, have taken deep root in the Soviet Union.

Under the leadership of the Communist Party, our people are marching towards communism with full confidence in their infinite energy.

The immortal ideas of Marxism-Leninism have armed us with knowledge of the paths and methods of communist construction, increased our strength, and made us hold an unshakable belief in the final victory of our cause.

(IV)

Comrades! In the past year, despite the resistance of aggressive forces, international events have still developed under the sign of a certain relaxation of international tensions. Thanks to the efforts of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the people's democratic countries, thanks to the efforts of peace-loving countries in Asia and Europe and democrats around the world, there have been some changes in international relations, creating more favorable prospects for consolidated universal peace.

However, this shift in events, which is in line with the interests of peace and the interests of all countries, obviously cannot and does not satisfy certain Western groups that have long advocated and implemented aggressive foreign policies. When peace-loving countries and peoples are committed to resolving international disputes through peaceful methods and negotiation channels, certain warlike groups in capitalist countries deliberately create tense situations in individual regions of the world, stubbornly refuse to resolve the issue of disarmament, and intensify the organization of aggressive troops in West Germany.

Just in these recent days, due to the conspiracy of these groups, an armed aggression against Egypt was launched. It cannot be ignored that Israel's armed attack on Egypt was instigated by certain imperialist groups, primarily the imperialist groups of Britain and France, and they immediately used this attack as an excuse to send their troops into Egyptian territory.

Thus, just as the people of the world were reasonably expecting further easing of the international situation, the British and French ruling groups organized an armed intervention against Egypt, posing a challenge to the cause of peace. Their air force and navy are bombarding the peaceful cities of Egypt. Peaceful residents are bleeding again, and humanity is once again facing the fact of aggression organized by imperialists.

No matter how the aggressors are now making empty talk, the broad public of the world is fully aware of the significance of the current events. The war against Egypt was organized by the British and French colonialist groups. They are unwilling to let the colonial people no longer serve as obedient tools in their hands and "dare to" establish independent countries. The war against Egypt is the desperate struggle of the old-brand imperialists, who are trying to stop the continuous disintegration of the colonial system with cannons and bombs, scare the people of the East who are carrying out the liberation struggle, and re-impose colonial shackles on them.

However, the destruction of the imperialist colonial system is an inevitable and objective process in the mid-20th century. More than 1.2 billion people in Asian and African countries have now forever escaped the shackles of foreign oppression. The sovereign states of Asia are an active force in defending world peace and striving for national independence and progress. All attempts by imperialist groups to reverse the wheels of history are hopeless and doomed to bankruptcy. The organizers of the aggression against the freedom-loving people of Egypt will surely reap what they sow. Throughout the world, especially in Asia, Africa, and the Middle East, a surging wave against the British and French imperialist aggression against Egypt has been set off.

In order to protect the freedom and lives of the Egyptian people, and in order to prevent the war from expanding to other regions, all peace-loving countries and peoples must take resolute action. Considering that the vast majority of the member states of the United Nations and the entire international public opinion condemn the aggressive actions of Britain and France, the United Nations can and should force the aggressors to immediately stop their military actions against Egypt, force them to withdraw their troops from Egyptian territory, and begin negotiations for a peaceful settlement of the Suez issue.

As for the Soviet Union, our government has expressed the will of the entire Soviet people, we not only strongly condemn the aggressive actions of Britain, France, and Israel against Egypt, but also demand that sanctions be immediately imposed on the aggressors. The Soviet government has already made suggestions to the United Nations and the US President, advocating that naval and air force forces be mobilized with other members of the United Nations to stop the war in Egypt and stop the aggression.

The Soviet people express their deep sympathy to the heroic Egyptian people and wish them success in their just struggle for freedom and independence!

Comrades! The world socialist system has exerted such a great force in a short period of time that even the obvious enemies cannot but admit its great superiority. The Soviet Union is victoriously resolving its basic economic tasks. China will become a great industrial country during its recent five-year plans. The people's democratic countries are firmly advancing along the socialist road.

The growing strength of the world socialist system has aroused the fear and hatred of international reactionary forces. Blinded by hatred of socialism, the imperialist groups are willing to take any means to create disputes in the big family of socialist countries, weaken the solidarity and friendship of the people of the countries that are building socialism, and break them up so as to try to eliminate them one by one. The imperialist groups have allocated millions of dollars to carry out unprecedented destructive work against socialist countries, carry out deceptive propaganda broadcasts every day, slander the historical achievements of socialism, send capable spies and saboteurs, release balloons with libelous pamphlets and leaflets, and constantly attempt to unite the remnants of the overthrown exploiting classes in people's democratic countries to form counter-revolutionary underground organizations.

The enemy also took advantage of the temporary difficulties and mistakes committed in individual people's democratic countries in order to achieve their sinister goals.

All of this should be constantly remembered, and the laboring people of socialist countries should never relax their vigilance and should clearly understand that as long as the imperialist camp exists, hostile forces will attempt more than once to restore capitalism. The recent events, especially the events in Hungary, have once again powerfully reminded us of this.

It would be incorrect to think that the people's democratic countries would not have difficulties or pain in the process of thoroughly transforming social relations over the past decade. Many difficulties and mistakes are inevitable, and the whole question lies in discovering mistakes in time and correcting them.

The fraternal Communist and Workers' Parties of the people's democratic countries have done just that. After the 20th Congress of the CPSU, they have strived to revise and improve the methods of Party and state work based on the characteristics of their own countries, and resolutely correct the mistakes committed in the past.

Unfortunately, the situation in Hungary was not like this. The former Hungarian leadership had committed many serious mistakes, but did not understand the requirements of the times and moved too late, thus arousing the dissatisfaction of the masses. Reactionary elements and anti-socialist elements, instructed by international reactionaries, immediately took advantage of this to launch an attack on the people's democratic system. They once misled a large number of masses, especially young people, with deceptive slogans. Counter-revolutionary forces at one time created an extremely dangerous situation for the fate of socialism in Hungary. In this situation, the Imre Nagy government, which was formed, surrendered to the reactionary forces step by step, and actually disintegrated after clearing the way for the counter-revolutionary forces. Counter-revolutionary bandits launched terrorist activities, brutally massacred famous social activists, and hanged and shot Communists. A large number of weapons were transported in through the western border of Hungary, and batches of officers and soldiers who had served in the Hitler army and the Horthy fascist army also sneaked in through this border. The situation in Hungary was chaotic and lawless. There was a direct danger of the restoration of capitalism and the landlord system and the revival of fascism.

If the reactionary forces and fascism had won in Hungary, the result would not only have been the loss of all the achievements gained by the Hungarian laboring people in the struggle against landlords and capitalists, but it would also have brought the imperialist base closer to the borders of other socialist countries, creating a threat to these countries.

At this critical moment of life and death for the Hungarian people, the socialist forces in Hungary made the only correct decision—to establish a revolutionary government of workers and peasants capable of blocking the path of reactionary forces and fascism. For the benefit of their own people, for the benefit of the Hungarian working class, for the benefit of the motherland, the revolutionary government of workers and peasants requested the Soviet military command to assist the Hungarian people in crushing the reactionary and counter-revolutionary dark forces, restoring the socialist system of the people, and restoring order and peace in the country.

Now, the socialist forces of the people's Hungary and the Soviet troops are crushing the reactionary and counter-revolutionary forces together, and will not allow the counter-revolution to destroy the achievements of socialism.

In these days, the Soviet people, the workers of all socialist countries, and all progressive forces in the world are very concerned about the development of the Hungarian events, and are happy for the victory of the Hungarian laboring people over the counter-revolutionary elements. Hungary has been, is now, and will be a free, independent, and equal socialist country in the big family of socialist countries!

Comrades! The recent increase in the tension of the international situation and the various conspiracies of the imperialist reactionaries require socialist countries to be more united and to further consolidate the friendship and mutual trust between the people of these countries. The unbreakable friendship and close cooperation in economic and political life among the countries of the socialist family

    伟大的十月社会主义革命三十九周年
    苏斯洛夫在莫斯科十月革命节庆祝大会上的报告
    （一）
    同志们！三十九年以前我国的工人阶级同劳动农民结成联盟在共产党的领导下消灭了可憎的剥削者制度，建立了世界上第一个苏维埃社会主义国家。
    伟大的十月社会主义革命胜利后的第二天，革命领袖弗拉基米尔·伊里奇·列宁就说：“从今以后俄国历史上开始了一个新的时代，这第三次俄国革命将终于导致社会主义的胜利。”
    （列宁全集第二十六卷第二○八页）。
    列宁的预言实现了。在十月革命所铺平的道路上，社会主义早就在我国取得了最终的不可改变的胜利。
    在一个过去经济落后的国家的无比困难的条件下，在已被推翻的剥削阶级顽强反抗的条件下，在资本主义包围和国际帝国主义对第一个社会主义国家进行疯狂斗争的环境中，苏联劳动人民在比较不长的历史时期内实现了对社会的社会主义改造，消灭了生产资料的私有制，永远铲除了人剥削人的现象。苏联成了强大的世界社会主义国家，成了一个拥有强大的工业、先进的农业、先进的文化和社会主义民主的国家。
    十月社会主义革命是世界历史上最伟大的事件。它向世界宣告新纪元的到来，即把人类从各种形式的社会压迫和民族压迫、从各国之间的战争和流血敌视中解放出来的纪元的到来，人与人之间建立真正人的关系和创造人类生存应有条件的纪元的到来。
    十月社会主义革命是以前俄国和整个世界历史全部发展的当然结果，同时它又有力地推动了世界事态发展，加速了历史发展中的迫切问题的解决，以至在一代之间世界就根本改观了。许多欧洲和亚洲国家的人民走上了社会主义道路。团结了十亿人口左右的国家的强大的社会主义世界体系确立了，并且正在不断加强。
    走上社会主义发展道路的各国广泛地运用了在我国革命过程中得出并且在苏维埃国家发展中受过实际考验的基本原理。世界共产主义运动和人民民主国家的社会主义建设的实践证实了列宁的指示：“我国革命底某些基本点所具有的意义，不是地方性的，不是民族特有的，也不是俄国所独有的，而是具有国际的意义”。（列宁全集第三十一卷第五页）。
    历史经验表明，社会主义革命胜利和在社会主义基础上建立新社会有如下这些共同的特点和规律性：
    第一，建立以工人阶级的先锋队为领导的工人阶级政权，第二，尽力加强工人阶级同农民和劳动人民其他阶层的联盟，第三，消灭工业企业、银行、运输业和邮电事业的资本主义私有制，建立基本生产资料公有制和实行计划经济，第四，坚决保卫社会主义革命成果不受以前剥削统治阶级的侵害。
    这些共同的特点和规律性绝不排除工人阶级取得政权的方式和方法、基本生产资料公有化的速度和进行其他社会主义改造的速度以及每一个走向社会主义的国家的社会主义民主形式根据各国发展的具体条件而有所不同，而且必然应当有所不同。每一个国家对社会主义的理论和实践都可以有自己的贡献，从而证明马克思列宁主义的创造性。各人民民主国家在这些年代里都积累了建设社会主义的丰富经验。因此必须仔细研究这些经验，并且在平等和无产阶级国际主义原则的基础上，在各个社会主义国家之间交流这些经验。
    社会主义在苏联的伟大的胜利，社会主义作为一个世界体系的确立，正在发生的帝国主义殖民体系的崩溃以及世界资本主义力量的严重削弱大大地改变并且改善世界各国先进的进步力量为了在新的社会基础上改造人类社会而进行的斗争的条件和形式。
    环顾一下社会主义大家庭的各国，苏联劳动人民就感到高兴，因为许多国家和人民都在进行社会主义事业，全世界社会主义力量的发展加速了，十月革命伟大的思想日益广阔地为自己开辟道路。作为真正的国际主义者的苏联人满意地看到了兄弟的伟大中国人民和兄弟的人民民主国家人民在社会主义建设中获得的历史性胜利。
    我们是在这样的环境中庆祝伟大的十月社会主义革命三十九周年的，即：我们全体人民，我们英雄的工人阶级，我们光荣的集体农民，我们优秀的苏维埃知识分子都在不辞劳苦地为实现苏联共产党第二十次代表大会的历史性决议而奋斗。
    苏共第二十次代表大会闭幕还没有多久，但是已经获得了苏联人有权引以自豪的卓越成就。
    （二）
    在我国争取建成共产主义的斗争中，1956年是意义重大的一年。城乡各地广泛展开的争取完成第六个五年计划的全民社会主义竞赛已经在我国国民经济的各部门产生了显著的成果。并且使得苏联劳动人民的物质生活有了重大的改善。
    我们的工业胜利地执行着第二十次党代表大会所通过的扩大社会主义再生产的纲领。1956年1月到10月之间工业总产值计划完成了102％。
    我们的党和全体苏联人民把力量首先是放在保证优先发展生产资料的生产上。苏联经济的中坚力量和整个国民经济顺利发展的基础——重工业的各部门正在高涨中。今年头十个月的生产生产资料的工业部门的产量同去年同一时期的产量相较，增加了11％以上。
    我们在生产工具生产方面有特别显著的增长。今年机器制造业和金属加工业的产量将增加12％，将增为1940年的五倍。我们在机器制造业方面所取得的发展是保证国民经济不断高涨的可靠基础。
    苏联在1956年将炼出四千九百万吨钢，开采四亿三千万吨煤、八千四百万吨石油，生产一千九百二十亿度电。苏联现在和革命前俄国相比，在炼钢方面增为十一倍，石油开采——九倍，煤——十五倍，电力的生产几乎增为一百倍。
    现在苏联工业总产量增为1913年的三十倍。
    这些数字反映了苏联变为伟大的工业国这一历史事实。这些数字确凿地说明了十月社会主义革命为我国的生产力的发展开辟了无限广阔的活动天地，说明了在1917年10月把命运掌握在自己手里的苏联人民的创造性和建设性的劳动具有伟大的规模。
    我们工业发展的速度大大超过了主要资本主义国家工业发展的速度。1956年苏联的钢产量将增为1929年的十倍，而美国的钢产量在这段期间仅增为一·八倍。苏联的石油产量在这段期间增为六倍，而美国的石油产量仅增为二·五倍；苏联的电力产量增为三十一倍，而美国——六倍。就钢、石油、电力的绝对生产量来说，苏联仍然大大落后于美国。但是，我们在发展速度上的优越性可以有把握地保证我们在历史上最短的时期内消除这个落后现象。
    社会主义经济制度比资本主义经济制度的优越性一年比一年明显地表现出来。在两个制度的竞赛中，胜利绝对地、完全地属于社会主义方面。全体苏联人深深地相信伟大的列宁的正确性，他在他晚年的一次讲话中说道：“我们也一定能够做到：用别的国家连梦想也梦想不到的速度赶上它们。”
    扩大消费品生产的条件正在生产资料的生产优先增长和我国农业发展的基础上建立起来。今年头十个月里，轻工业和食品工业部门的产量增加了10％，产品品种增加了，产品质量提高了。
    社会主义工业可以有理由地为自己的巨大成就而自豪。但是，如果我们的一切可能条件和后备力量利用得更充分、更好，如果一切工业部门的工作都是同样的好，这些成就本来还可以更大一些。另一方面，某些重工业部门1956年在完成国家计划方面落后了。这就是顿巴斯采煤工业、黑色冶金工业、水泥和森林工业。这样就在供应国民经济所需要的煤、金属、水泥和木材方面造成一定程度的困难。应当把克服这些工业部门的落后状态看成是对国家具有重要意义的头等任务。
    苏联工业中的工作人员应当采取一切措施来按时完成国家任务和计划，改善对企业的领导方法，坚决争取技术的进一步的进步，革新和改善生产设备。
    我们国家满怀信心地进入了一个新的科学技术工业革命的时代，这个革命的产生首先是由于利用原子能的方法的发现。大家知道，我们的工业原子能发电站已经顺利地工作了两年多了，我们正在积极从事建造一些新的、更大的原子能发电站的准备工作，我们正在建造使用原子能发动机的破冰船。在我们的工业、农业、医学、科学和技术方面正在日益广泛地利用放射性同位素。
    科学和技术的发展在许多工业部门中反映了出来。在炼钢和炼铁工业中广泛地采用了富氧鼓风。许多炼钢厂都在组织连续铸锭的工作。先进的机器制造工业企业正在推行精确铸造、精确锻压和矿渣电焊法。采油工业继续推广保持油层压力和用边水排油的方法进行二次采油。化学工业正在发展某些农产品的代用品的生产，这些代用品的质量不次于天然产品。许多企业正在推广生产全盘机械化和自动化。
    在社会主义制度下，社会生产可以最大限度地利用现代科学和技术的一切成就。可是，我们还有这样一些人，这样一些大大小小的生产领导人，他们不完全了解争取技术进步、争取在生产中迅速推广新技术的斗争是我们建设共产主义社会的最重要任务之一。还不是所有工业部门和企业都在利用现代科学和技术成就方面取得了应当有的成绩。特别是有色金属工业部、化学工业部、采煤工业部和农业机器制造部所属企业在这方面有严重的缺点。
    共产党认为争取技术进步的斗争具有决定性的意义，因此要求国民经济全体工作人员提高掌握新技术的责任感，更充分地利用先进的工作方法和方式，关心我们广大合理化建议者和发明家的建议。只有广泛利用祖国和世界科学技术的一切成就，才能很快地提高劳动生产率，发展工业、农业、运输业，巩固国防，增加消费品的生产。
    同志们！1956年在我国历史上不仅是工业上有巨大新成就的一年，也是农业获得全面巨大高涨的一年。虽然南部地区很大一部分冬季作物冻坏了，春天来得过迟，秋天多雨，集体农庄和国营农场今年的收获量仍打破我国历史上的最高纪录。苏维埃政权时期以来，国家从来没有像今年这样收购过这么多的粮食。今年收购的粮食比去年多了十亿多普特。
    生产战线和收购粮食方面的这种突出的胜利是我们光荣的全体苏联人民的功劳，他们忘我地实现了党对农业提出的巨大任务。
    共产党一向极其重视争取生产更多粮食的斗争，认为这个斗争是整个社会主义斗争的一个非常重要的组成部分。今天如果估计一下这个斗争的成绩，我们有权说，党不仅提出了生产足够的农产品的口号，而且找到了实现这项宏大的任务的正确的实际道路。我们所以能够在争取生产更多的粮食的斗争中取得卓越的成绩，是因为集体农庄和国营农场已经进一步巩固以及苏联政府给了农业大力的援助。
    单是在过去三年，社会主义工业就供给了农业六十五万台拖拉机（每台以十五匹马力计算），十四万二千台谷物联合机，三十四万五千辆载货汽车和许多其他的机器。
    党和政府遵循了伟大的列宁关于劳动人民个人物质利益对发展生产的重大意义的指示，设法提高了集体农庄和集体农民增加农产品生产时获得的物质利益，大大提高了谷物、马铃薯、蔬菜、棉花、甜菜和其他农作物以及畜牧业产品的征购和收购价格，从而把物质鼓励变成为发展生产的巨大力量。党和政府作出的关于农业计划工作新制度的决定，关于每月预支给集体农民劳动报酬的决定，以及集体农民有权自行修正、补充和改变农业劳动组合章程的决定对于提高集体农民的生产积极性和更合理地经营集体农庄的公有经济具有重大意义。
    在党和政府为提高农业生产所采取的所有巨大措施当中，特别重要的是在哈萨克、西伯利亚和乌拉尔开垦荒地。几十万苏联人热烈地响应号召去完成政府提出的在1956年开垦两千八百万到三千万公顷新土地的任务。为此拨出了大批现代化机器。到现在为止，实际上已经开垦了三千五百五十万公顷荒地。这几乎等于英国、意大利和法国粮食作物种植面积的总和的一点七倍。非常明显，只有社会主义国家和社会主义农业才能够在短时期中完成这样巨大的任务。
    我们党开垦荒地的方针已经证明完全是正确的。现在大家都已经清楚，开垦荒地对于粮食、特别是对商品粮食的生产有多么巨大的意义。例如，在垦荒以前，哈萨克、西伯利亚和乌拉尔在收成较好的年景，大约也只能向国家缴纳六亿普特粮食，然而在1956年国家在这些地区就征购了二十亿普特以上的粮食，同时，最近三年来，国家在哈萨克共和国征购的粮食增加为七倍。
    全体苏联人民参加了开垦生荒地和熟荒地的工作。数以十万计的男女工人、集体农民、工程技术人员和农业专家们志愿前往开垦荒地，在劳动上树立了真正英勇的范例。我们英勇的共青团，光荣的苏联青年在开垦荒地方面，作出了重大的贡献。响应共青团的号召迁移到垦荒地区去的有三十五万多名共青团员和青年。在今年的收获工作中，城市居民、学校的学生和苏军战士给了集体农庄和国营农场很大的帮助。党、苏维埃、共青团和工会组织以及农业机关的组织工作起了重大的作用。
    请允许我代表党中央委员会和苏联政府，在这个讲台上向积极参加开垦荒地的历史性战役的全体爱国者表示深深的感谢！
    今年，社会主义农业不仅是在增加谷物生产方面大踏步向前迈进了。像甜菜、棉花、马铃薯和蔬菜这样重要的农作物的产量和采购量也大大提高了。比如，甜菜的采购量比去年的相应时期多五百万吨。今年马铃薯的采购量增加为去年的一倍半以上。棉花和蔬菜的采购量也大大超过去年的水平。
    我们在发展畜牧业方面，特别是在提高牲畜产品生产率方面所获得的成就，是令人愉快的。在这种基础上，今年肉类、肉类产品、鸡蛋，特别是牛奶的产量和采购量增加了。比如，牛奶的征购量和收购量比去年多30％。
    可见，党、政府和全体苏联人民在争取在最短期间为居民生产足够的商品粮食、为工业生产足够的农业原料方面的努力，获得了极良好的结果。
    社会主义农业在进一步扩大粮食、肉类、奶类、羊毛和其他农产品的生产方面拥有真正无穷无尽的潜力。毫无疑问，集体农民、机器拖拉机站和国营农场的工人、农业专家、我们农村的共产党员和共青团员、党和苏维埃组织，会尽最大的努力依靠先进经验、现代技术和农业科学中的最新发现来利用这些潜力，取得更多的优异成就。
    1956年的标志是，劳动人民物质和文化生活水平有了巨大的提高。今年采取了一些符合全体人民利益的措施，例如缩短假日和节日前一天的工作时数、规定十六岁到十八岁的少年每天工作六小时、提高劳动人民的养老金和残废抚恤金、取消中学和大学的学费、增加孕产妇假期等，使任何一个工人家庭、任何一个苏维埃职员的家庭都能亲身体验到这些措施所产生的良好影响。从新年起，工资低的职工将增加工资。并且正在实行准备措施，以便从1957年起，把职工的工作日逐步改为7小时。
    集体农民的物质福利也大大改善了，因为由于集体农庄的公有经济的发展，集体农庄的收入在最近三年中增为两倍。今年，集体农庄和集体农民从交售和出售给国家的农产品中，可以比去年多获得二百亿卢布。
    苏联人民的生活水平在不断地提高。中央统计局有系统地进行的预算调查材料可以特别明显地说明这一点。从这些材料中可以看出，同战前1940年相比，1956年工人家庭中购买的织品平均增加了94％，其中毛织品约增为三倍，皮鞋增加了83％。在集体农民家庭中，按人口计算，1956年购买的织品量增为1940年的两倍以上，其中毛织品增为三倍半、皮鞋增加了95％。
    在职工家庭中，像肉类和脂肪这类产品的每一个人的消耗量比战前增加了62％，鱼类和鱼制品增加了92％，奶类和奶制品增加为两倍以上，蛋类增加了86％，糖增加了87％。
    在集体农民的家庭里肉类和脂肪的每人消耗量增加了54％，鱼类和鱼制品增加为二倍多，乳类和乳制品增加了47％，蛋类增加为二倍多，糖增加为三点六倍。文化用品和生活日用品的生产量增加了很多。仅在今年我们将生产约二千三百万个钟表和四百多万架收音机和电视机。
    苏联人民已开始吃得更好、穿得更好、更有文化地生活了。尽可能充分地满足劳动人民对工业品和食品的激剧增长的需要是我们国家最重要的关怀之一。现在已采取了必要的措施，以便增加消费品的产量，提高质量，和改善苏联的贸易状况。
    改善居住条件对于提高劳动人民的物质和文化生活水平具有重大的意义。1956年在各城市和工人镇将要动用总面积三千六百万平方公尺的新住宅，这个数字等于基辅、巴库、哈尔科夫、高尔基、斯维德洛夫斯克和车里雅宾斯克的全部住宅面积的总和。但是我们并不满足于住宅建筑已有的速度和规模。住宅问题仍然很尖锐。党和苏联政府现在已对这个问题予以很大的注意。
    苏联人民的文化正在蓬勃地发展。我们早就实施了七年制普及教育，现在正在采取步骤，以便在第六个五年计划里基本上在各城市和农村地区实施普及中等教育。使劳动人民接受高等教育的广泛机会已经创造出来。
    现在有四百万左右脱产和不脱产的人正在各高等学校和技术专科学校学习。苏联大学生差不多有两百万人，这个数字等于欧洲各资本主义国家的大学生总和的两倍多。
    在文化建设所取得的成就方面以及在物质生产的高涨中，苏维埃知识分子起了重要的、光荣的作用。我们的工程师和技师、农学家、医生、教师、科学家、作家和艺术工作者都积极地帮助人民完成经济和文化建设方面的任务。我们的党和全体苏联人民对自己的知识分子的崇高劳动给予很高的评价。人民的爱戴和尊敬鼓舞着苏联知识分子去作新的创造性的努力，加强了苏维埃知识分子对共产主义事业的忠诚。
    人民寿命的延长是我国人民物质和文化生活水平增长的重要标志。革命前俄国人民平均寿命只有三十二岁。而到1927年平均寿命就提高到四十四岁，现在人民的平均寿命已经是六十四岁了。这就是说，在我们苏维埃时代，人们生活得更好了。同志们！在大大增加了老年人的养老金之后，在劳动人民物质状况日益改善的情况下，现在我们可以希望苏联人民的寿命还会大大延长。要像马雅可夫斯基所写的那样：
            我们可以
                  活到百岁
            而
            永不衰老。
    不用说，共产党看到，在同人民的切身利益直接有关的各方面——在住宅建筑方面，在工业品和食品的生产方面，在贸易的组织和居民文化生活服务方面，我们还有不少严重的缺点和还没有解决的任务。党和政府今后将继续努力，在发展社会主义经济和提高劳动生产率的基础上，不断提高劳动人民的生活水平。使苏联人民的生活幸福——这就是我们党和政府全部活动的主要目标。
    （三）
    同志们！我国工农业的成就，人民物质福利的提高，苏维埃文化的发展——这一切证明了苏维埃社会制度和国家制度的强大力量和实力、我们苏维埃民主的极其伟大的优越性。
    十月革命所产生的苏维埃民主是新型的民主。同资本主义国家的虚伪的、残缺不全的民主、富人的民主不同，苏维埃社会主义民主是劳动人民的民主、人民的民主。
    苏维埃制度的深刻的民主性质在于：在这里，国家的政策是以各劳动阶级的利益和意志为基础的，而这些劳动阶级在资本主义制度下正是最受压迫的，资产阶级议会和政府对他们的利益是考虑得最少的。
    苏维埃制度吸收了千百万在资产阶级国家中实际上会被排除在政治之外的人参加政治生活，参加管理国家。例如，我们各民族的成千百万公民经常参加苏维埃的工作，在苏维埃所属的许多委员会和其他民主机构中工作。仅被选入地方劳动人民代表苏维埃的就有一百五十多万人。
    社会主义民主，作为一种真正人民当权的制度，提供一切条件使每一个苏维埃人能够提高觉悟，使每一个苏维埃人能够加强对国家的主人翁感。同时，苏维埃社会主义民主使全体社会成员享有劳动权、教育权和休息权，并且保证了这些权利的实现，这就为社会的物质和精神的不断进步，为每一个人的天才和能力的全面发展创造了一切条件。
    所有这一切并不意味着，我们在苏维埃民主原则的实践中没有缺点，我们国家机关的工作无可责难。对这一点党并不欺骗自己。
    在最近几年中，我们大力进行了精简行政管理机构，扩大加盟共和国和地方苏维埃机构的职权以及消除过分集中化、特别是农业计划方面过分集中化的工作。
    但是，我们的国家机关仍旧很庞大，在机关工作人员中还有人犯官僚主义和文牍主义，脱离生活现实，脱离人民，除公文外，他们再看不到什么事物和什么人。
    必须不断改进国家机关的工作，必须使苏维埃的工作建立在全体代表积极参加和他们同选民的紧密联系的基础上，必须坚决无情地反对官僚主义和文牍主义，为进一步发挥劳动人民的创造性主动性，为使工人、工程师和职员更加有效地直接参加管理企业和经济组织的工作寻找新的方式和新的途径。还必须在农村里大力发扬和加强集体农庄的民主，保证处处严格遵守农业劳动组合章程，消除地方组织对于集体农庄的细节的过问。
    在共产党第二十次代表大会之后，劳动人民的积极性、他们对国家各种事务的热烈关心越来越增长。对个人崇拜的后果的克服，开始充分地取得积极的结果。
    大家知道，个人崇拜是同约·维·斯大林的名字联系着的。斯大林在十月革命、社会主义建设、以及同工人阶级的敌人进行斗争中的功绩和作用是人所共知的。斯大林是一个伟大的组织者，巨大的马克思主义者。但是，对斯大林的个人崇拜产生了严重的错误和许多破坏社会主义法制的事实。个人崇拜是同马克思列宁主义格格不入的，是同社会主义的社会制度不相容的，因而它遭到我们党的坚决谴责。
    现在，党内生活的列宁准则和苏联社会主义民主原则已在恢复，党内在实现集体领导，因而党内群众和全体苏联人民的创造积极性不断提高，党的工作和苏维埃的工作大大活跃起来了，党内和党外的工作人员开始更勇于批评缺点，并且更积极地和缺点作斗争。全体苏联人民更加紧密地团结在他们亲爱的共产党的周围。
    进一步巩固同劳动群众的密切联系是党的刻不容缓的任务。党要求党和苏维埃工作人员、全体共产党员把他们主要的注意力和精力集中在具体的、活生生的工作中，要求他们深入到历史的真正创造者、共产主义的真正建设者——工人、集体农民和知识分子的生活中去。
    我们党认为，巩固同人民的密切联系是进一步巩固我们社会主义国家和胜利地向共产主义迈进的最重要的条件。
    苏联人民的团结一致是社会主义的伟大成就。社会发展的全部进程证实了列宁所说的私有财产使人分离，社会主义使人团结这句话的正确性。工人、知识分子和集体农民之间的兄弟友谊和合作，我国各民族的兄弟友谊和合作已经在苏联深深地扎下了根。
    我国人民在共产党领导下，满怀着对自己的无穷精力的信心向共产主义迈进。
    马克思列宁主义的不朽思想以共产主义建设的道路和方法的知识武装了我们，增加了我们的力量，使我们对于我们事业的最后胜利抱着不可动摇的信念。
    （四）
    同志们！过去一年中，尽管侵略势力进行了反抗，国际事件仍是在国际紧张关系有一定缓和的标志下发展的。由于苏联、中华人民共和国、各人民民主国家的努力，由于亚洲欧洲爱好和平国家和全世界民主人士的努力，在国际关系上有了某些转变，为巩固的普遍和平创造了更加有利的前景。
    但是，事件的这种符合和平利益、符合各国利益的转变，显然在过去和现在都不能使长期鼓吹和执行侵略性的外交方针的某些西方集团感到满意。当爱好和平的国家和人民致力于通过和平方法和谈判途径解决国际争端问题的时候，某些资本主义国家一味好战的集团故意在世界个别地区制造紧张局势，固执地拒绝解决裁军问题、加紧在西德组织侵略军。
    就在最近这些天，由于这些集团的阴谋发动了对埃及的武装侵略。不能不看到，以色列对埃及的武装进攻是某些帝国主义集团、首先是英国和法国的帝国主义集团嗾使的，而它们马上就利用这次进攻做为借口把自己的军队开进了埃及的领土。
    这样，正当全世界人民合理地期待国际局势的进一步缓和的时候，英法统治集团却组织了对埃及的武装干涉，向和平事业提出了挑战。它们的空军和海军正在轰击埃及的和平城市。和平的居民又在流血，人类再次面临着帝国主义者组织的侵略的事实。
    不管侵略者现在怎样花言巧语，世界广大公众是完全清楚目前事件的意义的。对埃及的战争是英法殖民主义集团组织的。他们无论如何也不愿听任殖民地人民不再充当他们手中的驯从工具而“竟胆敢”建立自主的国家。对埃及的战争是老牌帝国主义者的绝望的挣扎，他们企图凭大炮和炸弹来制止殖民体系的不断瓦解，吓唬东方正在进行解放斗争的人民，重新给他们套上殖民主义的镣铐。
    然而帝国主义殖民体系的毁灭是二十世纪中叶的必然的客观进程。现在亚非国家中已经有十二亿以上的人口永远摆脱了外国压迫的枷锁。亚洲的主权国家在保卫世界和平、争取各国独立和进步的斗争中是一支积极的力量。帝国主义集团一切想使历史车轮倒转的企图，都是没有指望的、必遭破产的勾当。对爱好自由的埃及人民发动的侵略的组织者，必将自食其果。全世界，首先是亚非各国和中近东国家掀起了反对英国和法国帝国主义进攻埃及的汹涌浪潮。
    为了保护埃及人民的自由和生命，为了防止战争向其他地区扩大，所有爱好和平的国家和人民必需采取坚决的行动。考虑到联合国绝大多数的会员国和整个国际舆论都谴责英法的侵略行为，联合国可以而且也应该迫使侵略者立即停止对埃及的军事行动，迫使他们从埃及领土上撤出他们的军队，并且开始进行和平解决苏伊士问题的谈判。
    至于说到苏联，我们的政府表达了全体苏联人民的意志，我们不但强烈地谴责英国、法国和以色列的对埃及的侵略行为，而且要求立即对侵略者实行制裁。苏联政府已经向联合国和美国总统提出了建议，主张和联合国其他会员国一起调动海军和空军力量来制止在埃及的战争，制止侵略。
    苏联人民对英勇的埃及人民表示深刻同情，并且祝埃及人民在争取自由和独立的正义斗争中获得成就！
    同志们！世界社会主义体系在短短的时期内发挥了这样伟大的力量，甚至显明的敌人也不能不承认它的巨大优越性。苏联正在胜利地解决它的基本经济任务。中国在最近几个五年计划期间将成为一个伟大的工业国家。人民民主国家正在坚定地沿着社会主义道路前进。
    世界社会主义体系的日益强大，引起了国际反动势力的恐惧和仇恨。帝国主义集团由于憎恨社会主义而瞎了眼，竟不惜采取任何手段，在社会主义国家的大家庭中制造纠纷，削弱正在建设社会主义的各国人民的团结友爱，把他们拆散开来，以便随后设法一个一个地消灭它们。帝国主义集团拨出千百万美元对社会主义国家进行空前未有的破坏工作，天天进行骗人的广播宣传，污蔑社会主义的历史成就，派出得力的间谍和破坏分子，放出带有诽谤性的小册子和传单的气球，而且不断企图在人民民主国家中纠合被推翻的剥削阶级残余组成反革命地下组织。
    敌人还利用了个别人民民主国家中暂时的困难和所犯的错误，以求达到他们阴险的目的。
    应当经常记得这一切，社会主义国家的劳动人民时刻也不应当放松警惕，应当清楚地懂得：只要帝国主义阵营存在，敌对势力将不止一次地企图恢复资本主义。最近的事件，首先是匈牙利的事件再一次有力地提醒了我们这一点。
    如果认为，各人民民主国家在过去十年来彻底改造社会关系的过程中会没有困难，没有痛苦，那是不正确的。其中有许多困难和错误是不可避免的，整个问题在于及时地发现错误并且纠正错误。
    各人民民主国家的兄弟共产党和工人党正是这样做了的，它们在苏共第二十次代表大会之后努力根据本国的特点修改和改进党和国家的工作方法，坚决地纠正过去所犯的错误。
    遗憾的是，匈牙利的情况却不是这样。前匈牙利的领导曾经犯了不少严重的错误，却不懂得时势的要求，动得太迟了，因而引起了群众的不满。受国际反动派指使的反动分子、反社会主义分子立刻利用这一点，开始进攻人民民主制度。他们以骗人的口号一度把大量群众、特别是青年引入了迷途。反革命力量有一个时候曾在匈牙利造成了对社会主义命运极端危险的局面。在这种局势下产生的伊姆雷·纳吉政府一步一步地向反动力量投降，而在为反革命力量扫清了道路以后就实际上解体了。反革命匪帮展开了恐怖活动，野蛮地屠杀著名的社会活动家，吊死和枪杀共产党人。大量武器经过匈牙利西部边界被输送进来，一批又一批曾在希特勒军队和霍尔蒂法西斯军队中服务的军官和士兵也经过这条边界钻了进来。匈牙利的情况一片混乱，无法无天。当时存在着资本主义和地主制度复辟和法西斯主义复活的直接危险。
    如果反动力量和法西斯主义在匈牙利取得胜利，其结果就不仅是匈牙利劳动人民丧失他们在同地主和资本家的斗争中获得的一切成果，而且还将使帝国主义基地接近其他社会主义国家的边界，而造成对这些国家的威胁。
    在这个匈牙利人民生死存亡的关头，匈牙利社会主义力量做出了唯一正确的决定——建立有能力阻塞反动力量和法西斯主义道路的工农革命政府。为了本国人民的利益、匈牙利工人阶级的利益、祖国的利益，工农革命政府请求苏军司令部援助匈牙利人民粉碎反动的和反革命的黑暗势力，恢复人民社会主义制度，恢复国家的秩序和安宁。
    现在，人民匈牙利的社会主义力量和苏军部队在一起粉碎了反动的和反革命的势力，不让反革命摧残社会主义的成果。
    在这些日子里，苏联人民，各个社会主义国家的劳动者，世界上的一切进步力量非常关怀匈牙利事件的发展，为匈牙利劳动人民对反革命分子的胜利而感到高兴。匈牙利过去曾经是，现在和将来都是社会主义国家大家庭里的自由、独立、平等的社会主义国家！
    同志们！近来国际局势的紧张程度加强了，帝国主义反动派在搞种种阴谋，这就要求社会主义各国更加团结，更加巩固这些国家人民之间的友谊和相互信任。社会主义大家庭各国牢不可破的友谊和在经济和政治生活方面的密切合作，是我们各国人民进一步繁荣富强的决定条件，是这些人民在帝国主义势力面前得到安全的保障。
    苏联政府10月30日的宣言对发展和进一步巩固苏联和其他社会主义国家之间的友谊和合作具有重大的意义。这个宣言再一次重申了第二十次党代表大会的路线——在同社会主义各国的相互关系中严格贯彻各国人民平等的列宁主义原则。
    社会主义各国相互关系的本质是：愈严格地遵守各国之间平等和互相尊重彼此的利益和权利的原则，这些国家人民的友谊愈形巩固，整个社会主义世界愈能团结一致。苏联、中华人民共和国和所有人民民主国家人民伟大的社会主义友好联盟是一个不可摧毁的堡垒！
    在这个面临帝国主义侵略势力想要制造国际紧张局势、煽起战火的新企图的时候，苏联和其他社会主义国家、所有爱好和平的国家和人民将积极为和平事业、为反对扩充军备、争取完全和无条件地禁止原子武器而斗争。同时我国政府还将警惕地注视帝国主义侵略者的阴谋。
    苏联今后仍将欢迎那些主张不是通过破产的“实力政策”，而是在清醒地考虑别国利益的基础上寻求解决争执问题的西方国家人士。苏联充满决心争取改进同西方大国——美国的关系。当然，我们大家都知道，美国的某些分子仍在煽起苏美分歧，试图利用国际上的困难进行投机。但是类似的政策正给美国自己带来损失，因此这种政策结束得愈早，对世界和平的事业和各国人民——包括美国人民——的安全也愈加有利。
    苏联政府花了不少的力量来改善同英、法的关系。我们希望英、法的和平力量不要让侵略分子破坏我们人民之间的友谊联系。苏联打算同日本建立牢固的睦邻关系，同它在维护和巩固远东和世界和平的事业中实行合作。
    我们高兴地看到，苏联同它的一些伟大的朋友——印度、印度尼西亚、埃及、缅甸、阿富汗和其他亚非国家的关系在最近期间更加巩固和扩大了，我们同伊朗、巴基斯坦和其他一些国家的关系也有了相当程度的改善。
    苏联的一切方面——政府、议会、社会、文化、体育等——的国际接触和联系都在扩大。所有这些形式的接触，在扩大国家之间的相互谅解、信任和合作上都起着巨大的作用。苏联政府打算今后继续积极促进这种接触和联系的发展。
    我们党认为，发展工人阶级政党同代表着千千万万劳动人民的工人阶级组织之间的接触和联系具有特别重要的意义。可以肯定地说，苏共第二十次代表大会关于不同的国际工人运动队伍合作的号召在各国社会党队伍中引起了巨大兴趣。在建立苏共和一些社会党的接触方面已经做出了开端。可以预期，这些接触将会扩大，从而有利于和平事业，有利于工人阶级。
    各国共产党高高举起工人阶级团结一致的旗帜。最近几个月以来，各兄弟党碰到了反动派想瓦解他们队伍的新的企图。工人阶级的敌人竭力想利用我们党反对个人崇拜的斗争达到这个目的。可是现在可以肯定地说，反动派这种打算已经被粉碎了。诬蔑共产党的宣传并没有得到预期的结果，并且很明显地这种宣传已经筋疲力竭了。企图把共产主义运动分裂成互相敌视的派别的阴谋，正遭到所有共产党的鄙弃。最近光荣的法国共产党代表大会和英勇的中国共产党代表大会又一次强有力地证实了共产党是忠于无产阶级国际主义原则的。
    目前各兄弟共产党正处在一个创造性积极性高涨的时期。苏共第二十次代表大会所提出的关于各国向社会主义过渡有不同形式的原理已经鼓舞了各国共产党人的理论思想和政治活动。各国共产党在马克思列宁主义、无产阶级国际主义原则的巩固基础上，仔细地分析本国的条件，制订最适合于这些条件的、争取社会主义的斗争方式和方法。毫无疑问，我们正处在各国共产党的活动的一个新高潮的前夕，正处在他们为争取民族独立和本国人民的民主权利、为劳动人民切身的利益、为世界和平、为社会主义而斗争的一个新高潮的前夕。
    同志们！伟大的十月革命旗帜，从来还没有像现代这样高高地飘扬在世界上。空前强大的社会主义、民主、和平力量团结在神圣的社会主义旗帜的周围。各国工人阶级和劳动人民在自己的事业达到完全胜利的道路上还需要克服不少困难，但是现代世界发展的基本路线已经最后确定了。现在，当社会主义在世界最大的两个国家——苏联和中国胜利了的时候，当世界社会主义体系出现了的时候，当伟大的印度、印度尼西亚、东方其他许多国家的人民已经取得了独立的时候，当欧洲和亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲国家千千万万的人不断奋起争取自己解放的时候，世界斗争最后的结局如何，已经毫无疑问了。我们的领袖和导师、不朽的列宁曾经说过，社会主义最后的胜利完全地、绝对地有了保证，他的话现在显得特别有力量。
    胜利的伟大十月旗帜——和平、社会主义和各国友谊的旗帜万岁！
    社会主义国家大家庭万岁，祝它繁荣！
    共产主义建设者——伟大的苏联人民万岁！
    苏联人民在建成共产主义的斗争中的伟大鼓舞力量和领导力量——苏联共产党万岁！
