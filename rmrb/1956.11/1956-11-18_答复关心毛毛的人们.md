Responding to Criticism

    Reply to People Concerned About Mao Mao

    After the reader's letter "A Plea for Mao Mao" was published on page four of this newspaper on August 19th, the editorial department of this newspaper alone received hundreds of letters, all condemning Li Jing's illegal acts of abusing Mao Mao. We have conducted further investigation and understanding of this matter, and the leaders of Beijing No. 4 Middle School have also conducted another review. Li Jing has also made a preliminary self-criticism.

    Mao Mao is the child of Li Jing's brother. Li Jing's sister-in-law once helped a friend take care of the child. Li Jing herself is a woman who was subjected to strict feudal family discipline. She is short-tempered and lacks the love and patience for children that women generally possess. Therefore, she adopted indeed intolerable and rough methods in disciplining Mao Mao. As a result, Mao Mao suffered some mental stimulation and sometimes behaves differently from ordinary children. (According to the inspection in late August, Mao Mao's mental state is basically normal.) In the past, the Party organization and administration of No. 4 Middle School had criticized and educated her several times, but their demands were not strict enough, the education was not profound enough, and they did not conduct regular supervision of her.

    The Beijing Municipal People's Procuratorate has investigated this incident and believes that Li Jing's treatment of Mao Mao violates Article 13 of the Marriage Law of the People's Republic of China, which prohibits the abuse of adopted children. It has suggested that the Beijing Municipal Education Bureau handle this matter appropriately. The Beijing Municipal Education Bureau is currently studying the matter.

### 答复关心毛毛的人们

专栏：对批评的反应

    答复关心毛毛的人们
    8月19日，本报四版发表了“为毛毛呼吁”的读者来信以后，仅本报编辑部就接到了数百封来信，一致指责黎靖虐待毛毛的非法行为。我们对此又做了进一步地调查了解，北京四中领导上也再一次进行了检查，黎靖也做了初步检讨。
    毛毛是黎靖哥哥的孩子，黎靖的嫂嫂曾一度帮助朋友照顾过孩子。黎靖自己是一个受过严厉封建家庭管教的妇女，脾气暴燥，缺乏一般女性所具有的对孩子的慈爱和耐心，因而对毛毛的管教采取了确实令人不能容忍的粗暴手段。以致毛毛由于精神上受到了些刺激，有时就表现得和普通的孩子不大一样。（据八月下旬的检查，目前毛毛精神上基本是正常的。）过去，四中党组织和行政上对她曾进行过几次批评教育，但对她的要求不严格，教育不深刻，也没有对她进行经常的监督。
    北京市检察院对这一事件已进行了检查，认为黎靖对待毛毛的行为，是与中华人民共和国婚姻法第十三条不得虐待养子的精神相违背的，并建议北京市教育局对此事作适当处理，现在北京市教育局正在研究处理。
