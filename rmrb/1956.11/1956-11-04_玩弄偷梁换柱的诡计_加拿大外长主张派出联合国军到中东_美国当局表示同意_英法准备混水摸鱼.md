Xinhua News Agency, 3rd. New York Dispatch: Canadian Foreign Minister Pearson advocates the establishment of a so-called United Nations military force to maintain peace in Palestine.

Pearson made this proposal in a speech yesterday after the UN General Assembly emergency meeting passed the American proposal. He said that the American proposal did not stipulate any steps to be taken by the United Nations or peaceful solutions, so a ceasefire would be temporary at best. Pearson said he hoped to authorize UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld to arrange with member states to dispatch a "United Nations force (to the Middle East) to maintain order." He said Canada was willing to participate in this force.

U.S. Secretary of State Dulles expressed "complete agreement" with Pearson's views. He also said, "Not only do I personally agree, but President Eisenhower also agrees."

Western news agencies, in reporting on this Pearson proposal, which has U.S. support, pointed out the common ground it shares with British and French plans. According to Western news agencies, Britain and France are finalizing plans to have a so-called "United Nations army" replace their troops after they occupy the Suez Canal area, in order to give their invasion of Egypt a veneer of legitimacy. The plan is that once British and French troops have consolidated their positions in the Suez Canal area, they can be replaced by United Nations troops. At the same time, reports say that British and French troops could be merged into an international police force.

Agence France-Presse reported that Pineau went to London yesterday to discuss this plan with Eden and Lloyd.

    玩弄偷梁换柱的诡计
    加拿大外长主张派出联合国军到中东
    美国当局表示同意　英法准备混水摸鱼
    新华社3日讯　纽约消息：加拿大外交部长皮尔逊主张成立所谓联合国军事部队来维持巴勒斯坦的和平。
    皮尔逊在昨天联合国大会紧急会议通过美国提案以后发表的演说里提出了这个主张。他说，美国的提案没有规定联合国所要采取的任何步骤或者和平解决的办法，因此，停火最多也不过是暂时的。皮尔逊说，他希望授权联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德同各会员国进行安排，派遣一支“联合国部队（到中东）维持秩序”。他说，加拿大愿意参加这一部队。
    美国国务卿杜勒斯表示“完全同意”皮尔逊的意见。他还说：“不仅我个人同意，而且艾森豪威尔总统也同意。”
    西方通讯社在报道这个受到美国支持的皮尔逊建议的时候，指出它和英法计划的共同点。据西方通讯社透露，英法两国正在拟定最后由所谓“联合国军队”来代替它们侵占苏伊士运河地区以后的军队的计划，以便为侵略埃及的行为披上合法的外衣。这个计划是，一旦英法两国军队巩固了他们在苏伊士运河地区的阵地之后，就可以由联合国军队代替它们。同时，有消息说，英国和法国的部队可以合并成为一支国际警察部队。
    法新社报道说，比诺昨天到伦敦就是同艾登和劳埃德讨论这项计划的。
