Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 8th. The total output value of more than 80 local state-owned and joint state-private factories in Changchun has reached the 1957 target one year and three months ahead of schedule.

Since the beginning of this year, 100,000 workers in Changchun have promoted more than 80 advanced experiences from local and other factories during the advanced producer movement, and have put forward a large number of rationalization proposals. As a result, from January to October this year, labor productivity in various factories increased by more than 30% compared with the same period last year, and labor productivity in more than 40 heavy industrial factories increased by 41% compared with the same period last year.

The long-term situation of poor product quality has changed significantly. According to statistics from the Changchun First and Second Industrial Bureaus, the quality of 157 out of 167 products has improved compared to the second quarter; 63 products that had previously failed to meet quality standards are now approaching the quality level of advanced enterprises. Due to the conscientious promotion of team-based economic accounting in various light industrial factories, the quantity of production and sales has increased, and the cost of 152 major products has been reduced by 2.32% compared with the original plan.

From 1954 to the end of October this year, these factories have successfully trial-produced and put into production 187 new products. Pigskin shoes produced by the Changchun Shoe Factory, Zhuzhiling (Pig Cure) produced by the Changchun Chemical Pharmaceutical Factory, and various types of small furniture newly produced by the Changchun Furniture Factory are all popular with consumers.

    长春市八十多个工厂
    劳动生产率比去年同期提高30％以上
    新华社长春8日电　长春市有八十多个地方国营和公私合营工厂的生产总值，已经提前一年零三个月达到了1957年的指标。
    今年以来，长春市十万职工在先进生产者运动中推广了八十多项本市和外厂的先进经验，并且提出了大批的合理化建议。因此今年1月到10月，各厂劳动生产率比去年同期提高了30％以上，四十多个重工业工厂的劳动生产率，比去年同期提高了41％。
    过去产品质量长期低劣的状况已经有显著改变。据长春市第一、二工业局统计，在一百六十七种产品中，有一百五十七种质量比第二季度有所提高；过去一直达不到质量标准的六十三种产品，现在接近了先进企业的质量水平。各轻工业工厂由于认真推广班组经济核算，产销数量增加，有一百五十二种主要产品成本比原计划降低2.32％。
    这些工厂从1954年到今年10月末，试制成功和投入生产的新产品有一百八十七种。长春制鞋厂生产的猪皮鞋、长春市化学制药厂生产的治猪灵和长春家具厂新生产的各式小型家具，都受到消费者的欢迎。
