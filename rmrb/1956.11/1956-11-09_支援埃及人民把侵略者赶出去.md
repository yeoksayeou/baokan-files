Editorial:

    On November 7th, our government issued a statement responding to the Egyptian government's call for assistance, firmly supporting the Soviet government's proposal to take emergency measures to stop the Anglo-French aggression. In its statement, our government resolutely demanded that the aggressive troops of Britain, France, and Israel withdraw from Egyptian territory and truly achieve a ceasefire, and expressed its willingness to take all effective measures within its capacity, including providing material assistance, to support Egypt's struggle against Anglo-French aggression. This statement by our government fully expresses the strong desire of the 600 million Chinese people to safeguard peace and stop aggression, and their fraternal support for the Egyptian people who are fighting to defend their national sovereignty and independence.
    At present, although the Anglo-French and Israeli aggressors have been forced to announce their agreement to a ceasefire due to the resolute efforts of the world's peace forces, the flames of war have not truly stopped, and the tense situation in the Middle East has not eased. The Anglo-French aggressors are using hypocritical tricks to continue expanding their aggression under the guise of announcing a ceasefire. British Prime Minister Eden openly admitted in the House of Commons that there were still "shooting incidents" in Port Said after the ceasefire took effect. The Anglo-French aggressive forces are also deliberately blocking military news to cover up their criminal activities. According to reports from the Egyptian side, Britain and France are still attacking Egyptian soldiers and civilians in Port Said. At the same time, Britain is sending reinforcements to the Mediterranean region. The obvious aim of the Anglo-French aggressors is to use Port Said as a foothold to further expand their aggression. If this plan fails, they will forcibly create a so-called "ceasefire line" in the Suez Canal area, so that the "United Nations Force" proposed by Canada can be applied to the Suez Canal area. Eden publicly declared in the House of Commons that "we have no intention at all" of withdrawing Anglo-French troops until the "United Nations Force" takes over. At the same time, if the "United Nations Force" does not include Anglo-French troops, Eden refuses to guarantee the withdrawal of Anglo-French aggressive troops. This most clearly exposes the shameless conspiracy of Britain and France to use the "United Nations Force" to achieve "international control" of the Suez Canal. In order to allow the Anglo-French aggressive troops to continue to remain in the canal area, Britain and France have created a so-called excuse of "clearing obstacles in the canal." Echoing this conspiracy of Britain and France, Israeli Prime Minister Ben-Gurion openly clamored to seize Egypt's Sinai Peninsula and the Gaza Strip, and threatened to abolish the 1949 Israeli-Egyptian armistice line.
    All of this proves that if the Anglo-French and Israeli aggressive troops do not immediately and unconditionally withdraw from Egyptian territory, the situation in the Middle East will become more complicated, and there will be a danger of the flames of war rekindling. The so-called ceasefire announced by Britain, France, and Israel will only be a delaying tactic, and this kind of ceasefire is bound to become the most despicable and vile manipulation of the good wishes of all peace-loving people in the world. Therefore, demanding that the Anglo-French and Israeli troops truly implement a ceasefire and immediately and unconditionally withdraw from Egypt is the key issue in the current serious struggle to maintain peace in the Middle East. On November 7th, the United Nations General Assembly passed a joint proposal put forward by nineteen Asian and African countries with an absolute majority of sixty-five votes, demanding the immediate withdrawal of all Anglo-French and Israeli aggressive troops from Egyptian territory. This proposal is completely correct. We fully support this proposal which is in line with the Bandung spirit and the principles of the United Nations Charter.
    Although the United States supported the resolution demanding the withdrawal of Anglo-French troops from Egypt at the United Nations General Assembly on the 7th, as pointed out in our government's statement, the United States is using Anglo-French aggression in an attempt to achieve its goal of controlling Egypt. United Press International revealed a noteworthy piece of news from Washington on the 7th. This news said that the United States would promote the entry of "United Nations forces" into the Middle East to replace the Anglo-French-Israeli aggressive troops. Then the United States will propose that the United Nations establish two committees, one to resolve the disputes between Arab countries and Israel, and the other to resolve the Suez Canal issue. This news fully demonstrates how the United States intends to use the current situation to achieve its own aggressive purposes.
    Obviously, the issue of stopping Anglo-French-Israeli aggression and withdrawing aggressive troops must not be linked to the Suez Canal issue. The Suez Canal issue must be resolved separately on the basis of restoring Egypt's sovereignty over the Suez Canal. The Anglo-French aggressors are blatantly trying to link the two together, shamelessly demanding that the world recognize the fruits of their aggression. If the United States takes the kind of approach revealed in the United Press International news, it is supporting the Anglo-French aggressors.
    In order to force the Anglo-French-Israeli aggressors to truly implement a ceasefire and immediately and unconditionally withdraw their aggressive troops, the Egyptian people and the peace-loving people of the world still need to wage arduous struggles. Our Chinese people have established the Committee to Support Egypt Against Aggression and will stand with the people of the world to support the Egyptian people to the best of our ability and drive the aggressors out of Egyptian territory.

### 支援埃及人民把侵略者赶出去

    支援埃及人民把侵略者赶出去
    我国政府在11月7日发表声明，响应埃及政府要求给予援助的呼吁，坚决支持苏联政府的采取紧急措施制止英、法侵略的主张。我国政府在声明中坚决要求英、法、以色列的侵略军队撤出埃及领土，真正实现停火，并且表示愿意尽能力所及，采取一切有效措施，包括提供物资援助在内，支援埃及的斗争，反对英、法的侵略。我国政府的这一声明，完全表达了六亿中国人民维护和平、制止侵略的强烈要求，和对于正在为维护国家主权和独立而斗争的埃及人民的兄弟般的支持。
    现在，虽然由于全世界和平力量的坚决努力，英、法和以色列侵略者已经被迫宣布同意停火，但是战火并没有真正停止，紧张的中东局势并没有缓和。英、法侵略者正在用口是心非的诡计，在宣布停火的掩盖下继续扩大侵略。英国首相艾登在下院公开承认，在停火生效以后在塞得港仍然有“射击行动”。英、法侵略军并且故意封锁军事消息，来遮掩它们的罪恶活动。而据埃及方面报告，英、法仍然在进攻塞得港的埃及军民。同时，英国还在向地中海地区增派援军。英、法侵略者的目的显然是要以塞得港作为立足点，进一步扩大侵略。如果此计不成，就在苏伊士运河区硬搞出一条所谓“停战线”来，以便将加拿大建议组织的“联合国部队”应用于苏伊士运河区。艾登在下院公然宣称，在有“联合国部队”接管以前，“我们心上根本不存在”英、法军队撤退的问题。同时，如果“联合国部队”中不包括英、法的部队，艾登又拒绝保证撤退英、法侵略军队。这就最清楚不过地暴露了英、法利用“联合国部队”来实现“国际管制”苏伊士运河的无耻阴谋。为了使英、法侵略军得以继续留在运河区，英、法又制造了一个所谓“清除运河障碍”的借口。同英、法的这个阴谋相呼应，以色列总理本—古理安公然叫嚷要强占埃及的西奈半岛和加沙地区，并扬言废除1949年的以、埃停战线。
    所有这一切都证明：如果英、法、以色列的侵略军队不立即无条件地从埃及领土上撤退，中东局势将更加复杂化，战火将有复燃的危险，而英、法、以色列所宣布的所谓停火，将只是他们的缓兵之计，这种停火势必成为对全世界爱好和平人民的善良愿望的最卑鄙下贱的玩弄。因此，要求英、法、以色列军队真正实现停火并且立即无条件地退出埃及，是当前维护中东和平的严重斗争的关键问题。联合国大会已经在11月7日以六十五票的绝对多数通过了十九个亚非国家所提出的一项联合建议，要求立即从埃及领土上撤出英、法、以色列一切侵略军队。这一建议是完全正确的。我们完全支持这个符合于万隆精神和联合国宪章原则的建议。
    美国虽然在7日的联合国大会上支持要求英、法军队撤出埃及的决议，但是正如我国政府声明中所指出的，美国是在利用英、法的侵略，以图达到控制埃及的目的。合众社在7日从华盛顿透露了一个值得注意的消息。这个消息说，美国将促进“联合国部队”进入中东地区，接替英、法、以色列侵略军。然后美国将建议联合国成立两个委员会，一个委员会负责解决阿拉伯国家同以色列之间的纠纷，另一个委员会负责解决苏伊士运河问题。这个消息充分说明美国在怎样打算利用目前的局势，来达到自己的侵略目的。
    很明显，制止英、法、以色列侵略、撤退侵略军队的问题，决不能同苏伊士运河问题联系起来。苏伊士运河问题必须在恢复埃及对苏伊士运河主权的基础上另行解决。英、法侵略者正是明目张胆地要把两者联系起来，无耻地要求全世界承认它们的侵略战果。美国如果采取像合众社的消息所透露的那种做法，就是在给英、法侵略者撑腰。
    为了迫使英、法、以色列侵略者真正实行停火，并且立即无条件地撤退它们的侵略军队，埃及人民和全世界爱好和平的人民还需要进行艰巨的斗争。我们中国人民已经成立了支援埃及反抗侵略委员会，将同全世界人民在一起，尽其所能地支援埃及人民，把侵略者从埃及领土上赶出去。
