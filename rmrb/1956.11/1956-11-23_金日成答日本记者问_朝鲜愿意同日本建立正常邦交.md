Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, November 22nd. Premier Kim Il-sung of North Korea received Akimoto Hideo, a reporter from the Japanese "Yomiuri Shimbun" visiting Pyongyang, on the 21st and answered the questions he raised.

Regarding the issue of North Korea-Japan relations, Premier Kim Il-sung replied that the North Korean government has repeatedly stated that it wants to establish normal diplomatic relations with Japan in accordance with the principles of peaceful coexistence. Although we have this desire, Japan has not yet established normal relations with its closest neighbors, North Korea and China, which is an abnormal situation that runs counter to the wishes of the Japanese people and the interests of overall peace. If the Japanese side shows sincerity towards the normalization of North Korea-Japan relations, we are ready to discuss this issue at any time. Kim Il-sung said that in recent years, people from all walks of life in Japan have visited North Korea, and both sides have common views on economic and cultural exchanges between the two countries. Continuing this exchange will promote the normalization of diplomatic relations.

Regarding the issue of Korean unification, Kim Il-sung replied that as long as it does not violate the wishes and interests of the Korean people, the government of the Republic will continue to seek peaceful means to reach an agreement between the North and the South.

On the issue of Korean residents in Japan, Premier Kim replied that we expect the Japanese government to make sincere efforts to guarantee the lives of Korean residents in Japan and assist those who wish to return to their homeland.

Kim Il-sung condemned the Anglo-French armed invasion of Egypt, saying that the Korean people are launching a nationwide movement to support the just struggle of the Egyptian people. Kim Il-sung said that we are extremely pleased to note that the progressive and peace-loving forces in Japan have taken the same stand as us and are supporting the Egyptian people.

When answering a question about the Hungarian issue, Kim Il-sung pointed out that the actions taken by the Soviet Union in Hungary in accordance with the Warsaw Treaty and at the request of the Hungarian government were completely justified. He emphasized that the relationship between the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries is based on the principles of complete equality, mutual benefit, and non-interference in internal affairs.

    金日成答日本记者问
    朝鲜愿意同日本建立正常邦交
    新华社平壤22日电　朝鲜内阁首相金日成21日接见了来平壤访问的日本“读卖新闻”记者秋元秀雄，并且对他所提出的问题作了答复。
    金日成首相就朝日关系问题答复说，朝鲜政府曾经多次阐明要遵循和平共处的原则，同日本建立正常邦交。虽然我们有这种愿望，但是日本至今还没有同它最近的邻邦——朝鲜和中国建立正常关系，这是同日本人民的愿望和全面和平的利益相违背的不正常状态。如果日本方面对朝日关系的正常化表示出诚意，我们随时准备协商这个问题。金日成说，近年来日本各界人士到朝鲜访问，双方对两国的经济、文化交流问题有共同的见解。继续这种交流将能促进邦交的正常化。
    关于朝鲜统一问题，金日成答复说，只要不违背朝鲜人民的愿望和利益，共和国政府将继续寻求和平途径，达成南北之间的协议。
    对旅日朝鲜侨民问题，金首相回答说，我们期待日本政府作出诚意的努力，保证旅日侨民的生活，协助希望返国的侨民回到祖国。
    金日成谴责了英法武装侵略埃及，他说，朝鲜人民正在展开全国性的运动支持埃及人民的正义斗争。金日成说，我们极为满意地注意到，日本进步的和爱好和平的力量同我们采取一样的立场，正在支援埃及人民。
    金日成在回答关于匈牙利问题的时候指出，苏联根据华沙条约并应匈牙利政府的请求在匈牙利所采取的行动完全是正当的。他强调指出，苏联同人民民主国家之间的关系，是以完全平等、互利和互不干涉内政的原则为基础的。
