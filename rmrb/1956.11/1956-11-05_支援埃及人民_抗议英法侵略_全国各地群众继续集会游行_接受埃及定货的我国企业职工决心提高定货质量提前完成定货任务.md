People from all walks of life in Tianjin, Shenyang, Guangzhou, Wuhan, Xi'an, Lanzhou, Hangzhou, Zhengzhou, Nanning, Kunming, Changsha, Xining, Baoding and other cities held rallies and parades yesterday. The masses in Jinan and Hohhot also held rallies and parades on the 3rd. At a protest rally of more than 30,000 people in Tianjin, Gral Koreitem, an Egyptian youth representative who was visiting Tianjin, said: "The Egyptian people will never let the imperialists ride on our heads again. We must resolutely resist to the end. With the support of peace-loving people all over the world, we will surely defeat the aggressors." At a protest rally in Hohhot, an old Hui woman named Ma Erli, who was ninety-six years old, introduced the atrocities committed by the Eight-Power Allied Forces when they occupied Beijing to the Muslims present. People from all walks of life in Fuzhou and Xiamen, as well as geological exploration personnel far away in the Qaidam Basin in Qinghai, have also carried out various activities to oppose British and French aggression against Egypt. In Fuzhou, sailors on seven ships including the Xin Mindong and Yongli, which had just returned from long voyages and were docked at Mawei Port, also held rallies to support the Egyptian people and protest British and French aggression. Lin Rongde, an old sailor in his fifties who had been sailing in the Suez Canal since he was seventeen, felt very distressed and indignant when he heard the news of British and French planes bombing Cairo and the Suez Canal ports. He said: "We must not let the robbers set fires. Our hearts are always linked with the hearts of the Egyptian people. We resolutely support their heroic struggle." The geological exploration workers in the Qaidam Basin were also excited by the British and French aggression against Egypt. On the 2nd, the drilling workers had just left the drilling rig and ran to surround the radio to listen to news about Egypt. On the field site, next to the drilling rig, and in the tents, petroleum exploration personnel were talking everywhere about the Egyptian people's struggle to defend their independence and sovereignty, condemning British and French imperialism. Enterprise employees across China who have accepted Egyptian orders have expressed their determination to support the Egyptian people with practical actions of improving order quality and completing order tasks ahead of schedule.

    The workers of the Tianjin No. 3 Joint State-Private Steel Rolling Plant completed the task of producing 1,000 tons of round steel for the Egyptian people yesterday. These steels are being packed for shipment. After inspection, it was proved that they are all Class A round steel that meet the physical performance standards.

    The employees of the four tea factories in Pingjiang, Anhua, Xinhua, and Taoyuan in Hunan Province are rushing to produce 800 tons of new specification "Red Leaf" broken tea for the Egyptian people. It was originally planned to be completed in mid-November, but now 90% of this order has been completed. The workers of Xinhua, Anhua and other tea factories who are rushing to produce broken tea held rallies, and the workers said that they would make this batch of tea as quickly as possible, and improve the quality of the tea, to support the Egyptian people who are bravely resisting the British and French aggressors.

    The employees of Hangzhou Hua Feng Paper Mill, who are producing typing paper for the Egyptian people, held a meeting during production breaks.
