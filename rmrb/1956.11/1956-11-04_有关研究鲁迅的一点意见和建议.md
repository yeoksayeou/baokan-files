    Some Opinions and Suggestions on Studying Lu Xun

    Shaoxing is the hometown of Mr. Lu Xun. Mr. Lu Xun spent his childhood and adolescence there for eighteen years. These eighteen years of hometown life had a profound influence on his thinking, especially the period of life in the countryside after his family declined. Around the time of the Xinhai Revolution, Mr. Lu Xun returned to Shaoxing to teach. He participated in the work of Shaoxing's restoration and witnessed the situation after Shaoxing's restoration. During his studies in Nanjing and Japan, and his work in Beijing, he returned home several times. In particular, when he returned to Shaoxing in 1919 to move his family north, the scene of the countryside on the verge of bankruptcy and the "hardworking and numb" lives of the peasant brothers gave him even more profound stimulation. All of this is vividly and concretely reflected in his novels "The True Story of Ah Q," "Blessing," "My Old Home," "A Storm in a Teacup," "Divorce," and his famous collection of essays "Dawn Blossoms Plucked at Dusk."

    We believe that studying Lu Xun's life in his hometown is also a major aspect of studying Lu Xun and learning from Lu Xun. However, in the current biographies about Lu Xun, the chapters on his childhood and his time working in Shaoxing are few, and the content is mostly copied from novels, which does not fully match the actual life. In general articles, it is even rarer to find concrete and in-depth introductions, discussions, and research on Lu Xun's life activities, ideological changes and development, and their impact on literary creation during his time in his hometown. In recent years, although some people studying Lu Xun have come to Shaoxing, they always come and go in a hurry, without going deep, and what they write is mostly general interview notes and travel notes. However, in Shaoxing, there are many materials that greatly help to study Lu Xun's childhood, waiting for people to collect. The Shaoxing Lu Xun Memorial Hall has already collected a list of people who had direct or indirect contact with Lu Xun at that time. Among them are Lu Xun's classmates when he was studying, friends when he was teaching, students, relatives who came to the Zhou family, neighbors, old people who participated in the Xinhai Revolution and the restoration of Shaoxing, as well as people from the hometown of his maternal grandmother, uncle, and Runtu who know something about Lu Xun's life back then. These people are at least sixty years old or older. If we do not seize the time to work, the loss and regret will be irreparable. In fact, many old people have passed away, such as Wang Wenhao, who was one of Lu Xun's students when he worked at Shaoxing Prefectural Middle School, and one of the people who ran the "Yueduo Daily" (a newspaper run by students supported by Lu Xun at the time, criticizing the military government at the time). However, he died in 1952.

    Of course, it is primarily the responsibility of the staff of the Shaoxing Lu Xun Memorial Hall to carry out these tasks, but due to our level, we need the inspiration and help of experts. Therefore, we sincerely hope that experts studying Lu Xun can come to Shaoxing for a relatively long period of time to carry out this work. We believe that this work will greatly help to study and learn from Lu Xun's great life.

    有关研究鲁迅的一点意见和建议
    绍兴，是鲁迅先生的故乡，在这里，鲁迅先生度过了他的童年、少年时期的十八年。这十八年的家乡生活，对他的思想有过深刻的影响，特别是在他家庭没落后在农村的一段生活。辛亥革命前后，鲁迅先生又回到绍兴教书，他参加了绍兴光复的工作，也目睹了绍兴光复后的状况。他在南京、日本求学和北京工作期间，也曾几度回到家里去，尤其是1919年回绍兴搬家北上，当时农村濒临破产的情景和农民弟兄“辛苦麻木”的生活，曾给予他更其深刻的刺激。所有这一切，都非常生动具体地反映在他的小说“阿Q正传”、“祝福”、“故乡”、“风波”、“离婚”和他的有名的散文集“朝花夕拾”里。
    我们觉得研究鲁迅当年在故乡的生活情况，也是研究鲁迅学习鲁迅的一个主要方面。可是目前在有关鲁迅的传记里，少年时期和在绍兴工作时期占的篇幅既少，内容又大部分是抄的小说，和实际生活并不尽符。在一般的文章里，能具体深入地介绍、论述、研究鲁迅在家乡时期的生活活动情况，思想变化和发展情况及其对于文学创作的影响等等，就更加少见了。最近几年来，虽然也有些研究鲁迅的人来过绍兴，但总是来去匆匆，没有深入下去，写的也多是一般性的访问记和游记。而在绍兴却有许多大大有助于研究鲁迅少年时代的资料，等待着人们去搜集。绍兴鲁迅纪念馆已经掌握了一批当时和鲁迅有过直接或间接接触的人的名单。其中有鲁迅读书时的同窗，教书时的朋友，学生，来往周家的亲戚，邻居，参加过辛亥革命光复绍兴的老人，以及外婆、舅父、闰土家乡的多少知道鲁迅当年生活的人。这些人至少都已在六十以上的高龄，倘我们不能抓紧时间工作，损失与遗憾将是无法弥补的。事实上已有不少老人去世，如王文灏，他是鲁迅在绍兴府中学堂工作时的学生之一，是办“越铎日报”（为鲁迅当时所支持的学生办的抨击当时军政府的报纸）的人员之一，可是，他在1952年就死了。
    当然，这些工作是绍兴鲁迅纪念馆的工作人员首先有责任来进行的，但是，由于我们水平的关系，我们需要专家的启发和帮助。因此，我们衷心地希望，研究鲁迅的专家们能以一个比较长的时间，来绍兴进行这一工作；我们相信，这个工作是大大地有助于研究和学习鲁迅的伟大一生的。
