    Newspapers Should Pay Attention to Promoting Thrift
    Since the beginning of this year, newspapers have continuously promoted the people's demand for high-end consumer goods, such as the production of high-grade fabrics and other supplies, the restoration of the making of famous dishes and snacks, etc., to show the improvement of people's living standards. This is entirely appropriate. However, on the other hand, we rarely see any publicity or reports about diligence and thrift. I believe that while newspapers promote the improvement of people's living standards and beautify people's lives, they should also pay attention to promoting thrift and report more moving examples of diligence and thrift. Otherwise, it will create one-sided propaganda and fuel the tendency towards extravagance and waste.

    报纸要注意宣传节约
    今年以来，报纸上不断宣传人民对高级消费品的需求，如高级衣料和其他用品的生产，名菜名点的恢复制作等等，以表示人民生活水平的提高，这是完全应该的。可是在另一方面，我们却很少看到有关勤俭节约的宣传报道。我认为报纸在宣传提高人民生活水平和美化人民生活的同时，也应注意宣传节约，多报道些勤俭节约的动人事例。否则，就会形成片面的宣传，就会助长奢侈浪费的倾向。
