    Greetings on the Opening of the Yugoslav Film Week
    Situ Huimin, Deputy Director of the Film Bureau of the Ministry of Culture
    From the end of November to the beginning of December this year, major cities in our country will hold a Yugoslav Film Week, screening the excellent Yugoslav films "Decisive Action," "Old Grudges and New Hatreds," "The Adventures of Little Warrior," and "The Two of Them." In these days of friendly exchanges and cultural exchange between the Chinese and Yugoslav people, I cannot help but recall my visit to Yugoslavia not long ago.
    Yugoslavia is a beautiful country, and the turquoise waters of the Adriatic Sea and the clear blue sky are unforgettable. But even more precious is the deep friendship of the Yugoslav people towards us. They welcomed and received us with such sincerity and enthusiasm. I remember meeting a doctor at the beach in Pola. After he learned that I was Chinese, he immediately ran over to talk to me warmly. After this encounter, when we met again, we were as close and familiar as old friends. Later, because I had a toothache and couldn't go to the beach, the doctor came to see me at the hotel. Although he was not a dentist, he still used his general medical experience to teach me many methods of care, and he even went to a small town nearby to buy painkillers and bring them to me. I sincerely thank him. I know that this is not only his personal concern for me, but also a concrete manifestation of the deep friendship between the Chinese and Yugoslav peoples.
    During my visit to Yugoslavia, I participated in the Third Yugoslav National Film Festival and saw many excellent Yugoslav films.
    Yugoslavia's film art industry is still relatively young. During the years of the anti-fascist struggle, Yugoslavia had only a few filmmakers who used handheld cameras to record some battle events on the front lines; formal film production only began after the Second World War. However, in just twelve years, Yugoslavia's film art industry has made rapid progress. Not only can it produce a certain number of films every year, but also the quality of the works has achieved gratifying results. It is particularly worth mentioning the growth and expansion of the Yugoslav film workers' team. Many young filmmakers had not studied at formal film schools in the past, nor had they been exposed to film work; however, after the end of the war, due to work needs, they immediately laid down their weapons and devoted themselves to the film art industry, and were tempered in their work, gradually transforming from a layman into an excellent film artist or technical engineer. The Yugoslav film workers' high enthusiasm and hard work are truly worthy of our film workers' learning.
    Because Yugoslav screenwriters, directors, actors, and others have all had the experience of fighting against the enemy and deeply understand the deep suffering that war brings to the people, many Yugoslav films depict historical events and struggle histories. This can be said to be a characteristic of Yugoslav film art. This type of film is very close to us. In addition, Yugoslavia also has some films that reflect modern life or are adapted from folk tales. These films also express the noble qualities of the Yugoslav people who love life and love their motherland.
    In this Yugoslav Film Week, we will see excellent films produced by Yugoslav film workers. We believe that through the screening of these films, the Chinese people's understanding of the Yugoslav people will be strengthened, and the friendship between the Chinese and Yugoslav peoples will be promoted. Here, I wish the Yugoslav Film Week a success, and on behalf of Chinese film workers, I warmly welcome our friends—the representatives of the Yugoslav film delegation.

### 祝南斯拉夫电影周开幕

    祝南斯拉夫电影周开幕
    文化部电影事业管理局副局长　司徒慧敏
    从今年11月底至12月初，我国各大城市将举办南斯拉夫电影周，放映南斯拉夫的优秀影片“当机立断”、“旧恨新仇”、“小勇士历险记”和“他俩”。在这中南人民友好交往和文化交流的日子里，我不禁回忆起不久以前在南斯拉夫访问的情形。
    南斯拉夫是一个美丽的国家，那亚得里亚海的碧绿的海水和那晴朗的蓝天是使人永远不能忘怀的。但是更可贵的却是南斯拉夫人民对于我们的深厚的情谊。他们是那样真挚、热情地来欢迎、接待我们。记得在波拉的海水浴场上，我曾遇到过一个医生。他知道我是中国人以后，立刻热情地跑来和我交谈。经过这次接触后，我们再见面时就像老朋友一样亲热熟悉了。后来我因为牙痛不能到海滩去，这位医生就到旅馆里来看我。他虽然不是牙医，但他仍根据一般医生的经验，教给我许多护理的方法，并且还特地到附近一个小镇去买了止痛药来送给我。我衷心感谢他。我知道，这不仅是他个人对我的关怀，而是中南两国人民的深厚友谊的具体表现。
    在南斯拉夫访问期间，我参加了南斯拉夫第三届民族电影节，看到许多南斯拉夫优秀的影片。
    南斯拉夫的电影艺术事业还是比较年轻的。在反法西斯战斗的年月中，南斯拉夫只有少数电影工作者用手提摄影机在前线纪录一些战斗事迹；正式影片生产，还是第二次世界大战以后的事情。但是在短短十二年中，南斯拉夫电影艺术事业却已有了飞跃的发展，不但每年可以生产一定数量的影片，而且在作品的质量上也有着可喜的成就。特别值得提到的是南斯拉夫电影工作者队伍的成长和壮大。许多年青的电影工作者，过去没有在正规的电影学校学习过，也没有接触过电影工作；但是战争结束以后，由于工作需要，他们立刻放下了武器，投身到电影艺术事业里来，并且在工作中得到锻炼，逐步由一个外行而变成为一个优秀的电影艺术家或者技术工程人员。南斯拉夫电影工作者对待工作的高度热情和刻苦精神，实在是值得我们的电影工作者学习的。
    正因为南斯拉夫的电影剧作者、导演、演员等大都有着对敌斗争的经历，深知战争带给人民的深重的苦难，所以南斯拉夫影片中，很多都是描写历史事件和斗争史迹的。这可以说是南斯拉夫电影艺术的一个特点。这一类题材的影片对于我们来说，就是非常亲切的。除此以外，南斯拉夫也有一部分反映现代生活或者根据民间故事改编的影片，这些影片也将南斯拉夫人民热爱生活、热爱祖国的高贵品质表现出来。
    在这次举办的南斯拉夫电影周中，我们就将看到南斯拉夫电影工作者摄制出的优秀的影片。我们相信，通过这些影片的放映，一定会加强中国人民对于南斯拉夫人民的了解，一定会促进中南两国人民的友谊。在这里，我预祝南斯拉夫电影周的成功，并代表中国电影工作者热烈地欢迎我们的友人——南斯拉夫电影代表团的代表们。
