Xinhua News Agency, 6th - Paris dispatch: French Prime Minister Mollet convened an emergency cabinet meeting at one o'clock this morning. Mollet received a letter yesterday from Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Bulganin, warning Britain and France to immediately cease their aggression against Egypt. This is the first time the French cabinet has held a midnight meeting since the Vietnam People's Army liberated Dien Bien Phu.

Fifteen minutes after the meeting began, the United States Ambassador to France, Dillon, urgently requested to see Mollet regarding Bulganin's letter. Mollet then interrupted the meeting to consult with Dillon.

According to Agence France-Presse, during the cabinet meeting, Mollet also had a long conversation with British Prime Minister Eden by telephone. He also exchanged views with Washington and New York. In New York, the United Nations Security Council meeting discussing the Soviet proposal for military aid to Egypt had just ended.

Afterwards, the French cabinet spokesman announced that Mollet would meet with British Prime Minister Eden in a few hours to discuss the joint Anglo-French policy on the invasion of the Suez region.

    接到苏联警告信件后
    摩勒午夜召开内阁紧急会议
    新华社6日讯　巴黎消息：法国总理摩勒今天凌晨一时召开了内阁紧急会议。摩勒在昨天接到了苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁警告英法立即停止侵略埃及的信件。这是越南人民军解放奠边府以来法国内阁第一次在午夜举行会议。
    会议开始十五分钟以后，美国驻法国大使狄龙为布尔加宁信件事紧急求见摩勒。于是摩勒中断了会议去同狄龙商谈。
    据法新社说，在内阁会议进行期间，摩勒还打电话同英国首相艾登进行了长时间的谈话。他还打电话同华盛顿和纽约方面交换意见。在纽约，讨论苏联关于军事援助埃及的提案的联合国安全理事会会议才结束不久。
    事后，法国内阁发言人宣布，摩勒将在几个钟头内同英国首相艾登会面，讨论法英入侵苏伊士地区的联合政策问题。
