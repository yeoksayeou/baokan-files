The Prime Minister's Sleepless Night
Jin Feng

The Prime Minister is flying to Jamaica for a "rest" tomorrow (23rd). The Prime Minister is "overtired."

Tonight, in the huge Downing Street residence, a cabinet meeting has just concluded. The debate on the withdrawal issue is still unresolved. The Prime Minister suddenly slumped into an armchair, lost in thought. His grey hair, against his pale cheeks, was a blur. Months of tension, worry, anxiety and pain have etched indelible marks on his forehead. The enormous difficulties ahead further cast a deep sense of anxiety and sorrow on his face.

On the eve of leaving the Prime Minister's residence that he had longed for for thirty years, thousands of thoughts and feelings welled up in his heart.

Born into a noble family, living a noble life from childhood, and receiving a strict aristocratic education, Anthony Eden was the third son of Baron William Eden. His family was prominent. In the eighteenth century, his family produced two ambassadors, a member of parliament, and a colonial governor. Anthony Eden achieved early success. At the age of twenty-six, he was elected as a Conservative Member of Parliament, thanks to the promotion of his father-in-law, Sir Beckett. Beckett was a director of Westminster Bank and the publisher of the "Yorkshire Post." Later, he gained the appreciation of Conservative Party leader, Baldwin. Eden rose rapidly from then on. At the age of thirty-four, he became Deputy Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. At the age of thirty-seven, he was promoted to Lord Privy Seal. At the age of thirty-eight, he became Foreign Secretary. In those turbulent days of 1934-38, he travelled tirelessly between Paris, Berlin, Rome, Moscow, Prague and Warsaw, representing the British Empire in dealing with diplomats from France, Germany, Italy, the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia and Poland. He wore a white feather crown of supporting the League of Nations and maintaining "peace," playing a double game of consulting with the Soviet Union, Poland and other countries on the issue of concluding an Eastern European mutual assistance agreement, while at the same time encouraging Germany and Italy to rearm and attack the Soviet Union to the east. He has always advocated using the League of Nations to drive others to grab chestnuts from the fire for the British Empire. In 1938, he disagreed with Chamberlain's appeasement policy. His resignation caused a sensation and raised his value for further leaps to the top. The following year, he became Secretary of State for the Colonies, and the third year, he was appointed Secretary of State for War and Foreign Secretary in the Churchill cabinet. Up to this point, Eden was on a smooth path. He served the British Empire, striving to maintain the power and interests of the Empire. The elders of the Empire also attached great importance to this smooth, cautious, and witty figure.

In 1950, he married Churchill's niece. In June of the same year, Churchill publicly announced that Eden was his political heir. In 1951, Churchill became Prime Minister again, and Eden served as Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary.

In 1955, Eden's thirty-year dream came true. He ascended to the throne of the British Empire as Prime Minister, rising to the top of power and honor.

However, he also realized how heavy this Prime Minister's crown weighed on him! The British Empire was no longer the empire ruled by his eighteenth-century ancestor, that colonial governor! At that time, wherever the Empire's warships sailed, the Empire's flag was raised! The British Empire was not even the era when his predecessor and close relative, Sir Winston Churchill, dominated the world! At that time, the politics and diplomacy of many countries in Europe and Asia were still subject to the British Empire's control! Now, he is facing a difficult era, an era when the British Empire is tottering! The communist monster that Churchill wanted to strangle in its cradle has grown into a giant. The pearls of the imperial crown—India, Ceylon, and Pakistan—have broken away from the colonial rule of the empire and become independent. The last British soldier withdrew from Egypt under the setting sun. What is particularly embarrassing is that the United States across the Atlantic has greatly surpassed the British Empire!

What should the Prime Minister, who is unwilling to be reduced to a second-rate empire, do?

On the evening of July 26, Sir Anthony Eden was hosting a banquet for King Faisal of Iraq at his residence in Downing Street. As the champagne glasses were raised high, wishing the British Empire happiness, a messenger quietly approached Eden and handed him an urgent telegram. Eden politely walked aside and unfolded the telegram. His face suddenly changed. Egyptian President Nasser announced the nationalization of the Suez Canal! Eden hastily ended the reception and immediately held an emergency meeting with Foreign Secretary Lloyd and other senior aides.

The House of Commons was in an uproar. Churchill rarely appeared in the House of Commons, watching Eden facing the panicked and anxious parliament. Eden announced the freezing of Egyptian sterling balances and prepared to take military measures.

Warships were heading to Cyprus, twin-engine "Canberra" jet bombers were flying to the Middle East, and orders were issued to call up army reservists. Aircraft carriers sailed from British ports, and paratroopers set off for the Mediterranean.

Members of the "Suez Group" who had oil stocks and canal company stocks in the Middle East were clamoring. They said: "If Nasser is allowed to go unpunished, Britain's prestige (actually imperialist interests) in the Middle East will be completely lost!" They even suggested nationalizing the source of the Nile River in Egypt under British ownership!

Eden, who has close ties with the oil group, also seemed to be irritated. He abandoned the etiquette of a British gentleman and rudely attacked the Egyptian leader as an imperialist! Eden, who has always flown the flag of supporting the United Nations, completely abandoned the United Nations and asked Parliament to authorize him to use force freely.

"Intentional provocation," "What a seeker of peace," the opposition shouted in Parliament.

The London Conference was held, the Dulles Plan was put forward, insisting on imperialist privileges, but it failed!

The Users' Association plan was put forward, still a conspiracy of international control of the canal, and the result was also a failure!

On the platform of the United Nations, Britain and France were forced to admit several principles of negotiation with Egypt.

And British and French troops were heading to the Mediterranean in batches. Britain and France established a joint command in Cyprus.

However, Eden's policy of military threats was met with fierce attacks at home and abroad. The Conservative Party was also shaken. At the end of October, Defense Secretary Head suddenly took a "Canberra" bomber to Cyprus. Twenty hours later, he flew back. He received assurances from the Allied Commander-in-Chief: they could fight a quick battle and defeat Egypt at once!

Eden's criminal determination matured, and his adventurous determination matured.

On October 31, bombs fell on Cairo, Alexandria, Port Said, Ismailia, and Suez.

Eden came to the angry and chaotic House of Commons. As he began to read out the government's decision to send troops, opposition members pressed him, asking: "Has war been declared?"

Eden sat silently, refusing to answer.

"Answer!" "Do you have the courage to stand up?" "Shameful!" "War criminal!" "Resign!" These cold curses were hurled at Eden like hailstones. Parliament had to adjourn for half an hour.

At this time, hundreds of people crowded outside Parliament, shouting: "We don't want war!" "Eden must go!" Thousands of leaflets fluttered in the crowd, reading: "Britain is ashamed of Eden's aggression!" Police on horseback drove the demonstrators from one street to another.

The debate in Parliament continued until midnight, and the government's proposal passed with a narrow majority. The cries of protest still reverberated through the halls of Parliament, and the prisoner transport vans were parked at the door of Parliament.

World opinion opposed Eden. The United Nations General Assembly passed a ceasefire resolution by an absolute majority. British workers wanted to strike, and students wanted to boycott classes. The Archbishop of Canterbury asked the government for a ceasefire, and the churches prayed for peace. Oil pipelines in Arab countries were destroyed!

Eden's assistant—Minister of State for Foreign Affairs and Chief Representative to the United Nations, Nutting, resigned from him, just as he had resigned from Chamberlain eighteen years ago. His long-time collaborators—Public Relations Advisor Clark and Treasury Economic Under-Secretary Sir Boyle—also retired.

For Eden, such a blow was unprecedented. The personal political capital accumulated over thirty years of hard work was almost lost in five days of war! Eden spoke sadly in a speech about his personal tragedy. But things will not end with his personal tragedy.

The Soviet Union issued an emergency ultimatum, determined to maintain peace in the Middle East.

Eden was awakened from his bed in the middle of the night and convened an emergency meeting. After a fierce debate, Eden was in the minority and was forced to announce a ceasefire.

For the British Empire, this was certainly not a glorious ending, but there was no other way. The era when British imperial warships bombarded the port of Alexandria seventy years ago, forcing Egypt to submit, is definitely gone forever.

And what an embarrassing situation the British Empire is now in! Oil sources have been reduced by three-quarters, bread and tea prices are rising, gold reserves are dwindling rapidly, and all five million pounds saved by tightening the people's belts have been buried in the flames of Port Said, while British soldiers in Port Said are facing angry and hateful Egyptian people. The whole world is demanding the withdrawal of British and French troops, and the Conservative Party has different opinions on the issue of withdrawal...

At this time, the Prime Minister had to announce that he was "overtired!"

For Eden, this was certainly not a glorious approach, but there was no other way. In order to ease the intense opposition at home and abroad, and to find an opportunity to redeploy, he can only temporarily leave London for a "rest."

But even so, a strong sense of failure still weighed heavily on his heart. He felt tired and sad from the bottom of his heart. "Eden, oh Eden, you have disgraced the Empire in front of the whole world, and you have also disgraced yourself in front of the whole world!" That sharp pain quietly but viciously gnawed at him.

"Then what did I do wrong?" He looked around in panic, trying to justify himself: "Could someone else in my position have done better?"

"To maintain the honor of the Empire, this is the only way. Before God, I am innocent!" he muttered.

But in front of the thousands of dead residents of Port Said? In front of the dead British soldiers and their mothers' tears? In front of the angry accusations of people all over the world? ...

Sir Anthony Eden cowered. It was late at night, another uneasy, sleepless night!

    首相的不眠之夜
    金凤
    首相明天（23日）要飞往牙买加“休养”去。首相“过度疲劳”了。
    今夜，唐宁街的巨大官邸里，一次内阁会议刚刚举行完毕。关于撤兵问题的争论依然没有结果。首相突然地跌坐在安乐椅中，陷入沉思。他的灰白色的头发，衬着他苍白的脸颊，一片模糊。几个月来的紧张、烦恼、不安和痛苦已经在他的前额上刻下难以消失的痕迹。而未来的巨大困难更使他脸上蒙上深重的焦灼和忧伤的神色。
    在这就要离开他三十年盼望得来的首相官邸的前夕，千种思虑、万种感慨涌上心端。
    出身在贵族世家，从小过着贵族生活，受着严格的贵族教育，安东尼·艾登是男爵威廉·艾登的第三个儿子。他的家世显赫。十八世纪时，他一家就出过两个大使、一个国会议员和一个殖民地总督。安东尼·艾登少年得志，二十六岁当选保守党议员，得力于他岳父贝克特爵士的提拔。贝克特是韦司敏斯脱银行的董事和“约克郡邮报”的发行人。以后他又得到保守党党魁鲍尔的赏识。艾登从此飞黄腾达。三十四岁，他当副外交大臣。三十七岁，他升内阁掌玺大臣。三十八岁，他任外交大臣。在1934—38年那些风云紧急的日子里，他仆仆风尘，来往于巴黎、柏林、罗马、莫斯科、布拉格与华沙，代表英帝国与法、德、意、苏联、捷克斯洛伐克和波兰的外交官们相周旋。他戴着拥护国际联盟、维持“和平”的白羽冠，玩着一面和苏联、波兰等国磋商缔结东欧互助协定问题，一面怂恿德、意重整军备，东向进攻苏联的两面把戏。他一向主张利用国联驱使别人为大英帝国火中取栗。1938年，他不同意张伯伦的绥靖政策。他的辞职事件曾哄动一时，抬高了他进一步跃登龙门的身价。第二年他就出任殖民地大臣，第三年任丘吉尔内阁的陆军大臣、外交大臣。到这时候为止，艾登走的是一帆风顺的路。他为大英帝国服务，尽力维护帝国的权力和利益。帝国的元老们也十分重视这位处事圆滑、谨慎而又不乏机智的人物。
    1950年他和丘吉尔的侄女结婚。同年6月，丘尔公开宣布艾登是他政治上的继承人。1951年丘吉尔重新当首相，艾登担任副首相兼外交大臣。
    1955年，艾登三十年的梦想实现了。他登上了大英帝国首相的宝座，升上了权力和荣誉的顶端。
    但是，他同时也发觉了这顶首相的冠冕压得他有多么沉重！大英帝国，早就不是他的十八世纪的祖先——那位殖民总督统治时代的帝国了！那时候，帝国的军舰开到那里，那里升起帝国的国旗！大英帝国甚至也不是他的前辈和至戚丘吉尔爵士叱咤风云的时代了！那时候，欧洲和亚洲许多国家的政治和外交还听任英帝国支配！现在，他面临的是一个艰苦的时代，英帝国摇摇欲坠的时代！丘吉尔想在摇篮里就扼死它的共产主义怪物已经长成一个巨人。帝国皇冠的珍珠——印度、锡兰和巴基斯坦已纷纷脱离帝国的殖民统治而独立。最后一个英国士兵在夕阳斜照下撤离埃及。尤其难堪的是大西洋彼岸的美国已经大大压倒了大英帝国！
    不甘心沦为二流帝国的首相又该如何办呢？
    7月26日的晚间，艾登爵士正在唐宁街的官邸设宴招待伊拉克国王费萨尔。当香槟酒杯高高举起，谨祝英帝国的幸福的时候，一个信使悄悄走到艾登身边，交给他一封急电。艾登有礼貌地走过一边，折开电文。他的脸色骤然变了。埃及的纳赛尔总统宣布苏伊士运河国有化了！艾登草草结束了招待会，立即同外交大臣劳埃德和其他高级助手举行紧急会议。
    下院吵闹成一片。丘吉尔难得地在下院出现，看着那面对着惊慌而焦急的议会的艾登。艾登宣布冻结埃及的英镑结余，并准备采取军事措施。
    军舰在开往塞浦路斯，双引擎的“堪培拉”式喷气轰炸机正飞往中东，发布了征召陆军后备军人的命令。航空母舰驶离了英国港口，伞兵出发到地中海。
    在中东有着石油股票和运河公司股票的“苏伊士集团”的议员极力叫嚣着。他们说：“如果纳赛尔逍遥自在而不受到处罚，英国在中东的威信（实即帝国主义利益）将完全失掉！”他们甚至建议把埃及的尼罗河河源收归英国国有！
    和石油集团有着密切关系的艾登看来也被激怒了，他丢开了英国绅士的礼貌，粗暴地攻击埃及领袖是一个帝国主义者！一向打着赞助联合国旗帜的艾登竟完全撇开了联合国，要求议会授权他有使用武力的自由。
    “有意的挑衅”，“好一个谋求和平的人”，反对党在议会叫嚷着。
    伦敦会议开过了，杜勒斯计划提出来了，坚持着帝国主义的特权，失败了！
    使用国协会计划提出来，还是国际管制运河的阴谋，结果也是失败了！
    在联合国的讲坛上，英法被迫承认了和埃及谈判的几项原则。
    而英、法军队在一批批开往地中海。英、法在塞浦路斯成立了联合司令部。
    但是，艾登的武力威胁政策受到国内外的猛烈攻击。保守党内部也在动摇。10月底，国防大臣赫德突然坐了一架“堪培拉”轰炸机飞往塞浦路斯。二十小时以后他飞回来了。他得到联军总司令的保证：能够速战速决，一下打垮埃及！
    艾登的犯罪决心成熟了，冒险的决心成熟了。
    10月31日，炸弹落在开罗、亚历山大港、塞得港、伊士美利亚和苏伊士。
    艾登来到愤怒而混乱的下院议会。当他开始宣读政府出兵的决定，反对党的议员逼着问：“是否已经宣战？”
    艾登沉默地坐着拒绝回答。
    “答复！”“你有勇气站起来吗？”“可耻！”“战争罪犯！”“辞职！”这些冷酷的咒骂像冰雹一样向艾登投掷过来。议会不得不宣布休会半小时。
    这时，成百的人拥挤在议会外面，高呼着：“我们不要战争！”“艾登必须滚蛋！”千万张传单在人丛中飞扬着，上面写着：“英国为艾登的侵略感到羞耻！”警察骑着高头大马，把示威的人群从一条街赶到另一条街。
    议会的辩论一直进行到半夜，政府的提案以勉强的多数通过。抗议的呼声还震澈着议会的厅堂，而捕人的囚车就停在议会的门口。
    全世界的舆论反对艾登。联合国大会以绝对多数通过停火决议。英国的工人要罢工，学生要罢课。坎特伯雷大主教向政府要求停火，教堂为和平祈祷。在阿拉伯国家的输油管破坏了！
    艾登的助手——外交部国务大臣兼驻联合国首席代表纳丁像十八年前他向张伯伦辞职一样向他辞了职。接着引退的还有他的多年的合作者——公共关系顾问克拉克和财政部经济次官波伊尔爵士。
    对于艾登，这样的打击是空前的。三十年辛勤攒积起来的个人政治资本差不多在五天的战争中输光了！艾登在一次演说中悲伤地谈到他个人的悲剧。而事情并不会因为他个人的悲剧而了结。
    苏联提出了紧急通牒，决心维护中东和平。
    艾登半夜里被人从床上叫起来，召开了紧急会议。经过激烈的争辩，艾登处于少数派地位，被迫宣布停火。
    对于大英帝国来说，这当然不是光采的下场，但别无他法。七十多年前英帝国军舰炮轰亚历山大港口强迫埃及屈服的时代，肯定是一去不复返的了。
    而现在的英帝国陷入了怎样狼狈的境地！石油来源减少四分之三，面包和茶叶在涨价，黄金储备在急剧减少，靠勒紧人民腰带节省下来的五百万英镑全部葬送在塞得港的火焰里，而塞得港的英国士兵面对着愤怒和仇恨的埃及人民。全世界在要求着英法撤兵，保守党内部在撤兵问题上意见又不一致……
    这时候，首相不得不被迫宣布：他“过度疲劳”了！
    对于艾登来说，这当然不是光采的做法，但也是别无他法。为了缓和国内外激烈的反对情绪，为了寻找时机重新施展身手，他只能暂时远离伦敦“休养”去了。
    但是，即使如此，一股强烈的失败感觉依然沉重地压在他心上。他从心底感到疲倦和悲哀。“艾登呵艾登，你使帝国在全世界面前丢脸了，你也使自己在全世界面前丢脸了！”那尖锐的痛苦悄悄地但又恶毒地咬啮着他。
    “那我究竟做错了什么呢？”他仓惶四顾着，企图给自己辩解：“换别一个人在我的位置上难道又能做得好些吗？”
    “要保持帝国的荣誉，就只能这样做。在上帝面前，我是没有罪的！”他喃喃地说。
    但是，在几千已经死亡的塞得港居民面前呢？在已经死亡的英国士兵和他们母亲的眼泪面前呢？在全世界人民愤怒的指责面前呢？……
    艾登爵士瑟缩了。夜深了，又一个不安的不眠之夜！
