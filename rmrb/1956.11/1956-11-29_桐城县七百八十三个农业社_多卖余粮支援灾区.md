Tongcheng County's 783 Agricultural Cooperatives
Sell Surplus Grain to Support Disaster Areas

(Report from our station in Anhui) Tongcheng County's 783 agricultural cooperatives, including Fanshen and Tiancheng, sold more than 35 million jin of surplus grain to support their farmer brothers in disaster areas. The extra grain sold by these agricultural cooperatives in Tongcheng County was based on this year's actual output. After deducting the grain retained for their own use and the grain purchased by the state, they sold the surplus grain through self-reporting and consultation. After mobilization, the members of these agricultural cooperatives all knew that their cooperatives had increased production and that they should support their farmer brothers in disaster areas and national construction. Su Wanghe, director of Tiancheng Agricultural Cooperative, said that they had also suffered from disasters in 1954. At that time, they had no food or seeds. Fortunately, the government transferred 200,000 jin of food and 16,000 jin of seeds from Sichuan non-disaster areas to solve their difficulties. He said that this year their production has increased, and they should support the disaster areas. Therefore, in addition to completing the task of purchasing grain, they also decided to sell another 540,000 jin of surplus grain to the state. The more than 700 cooperatives in Tongcheng County also wrote a letter to the farmers in the Huaibei disaster area to express their support.

    桐城县七百八十三个农业社
    多卖余粮支援灾区
    本报讯　安徽省桐城县翻身、天成等七百八十三个农业社，多卖余粮三千五百多万斤支援灾区农民兄弟。桐城县这些农业社多卖的余粮，是根据今年实际产量，除去留用粮和征购的粮食后，在多余的粮食中，通过自报和协商的办法多卖的。这些农业社的社员们，经过动员后，都知道自己社增了产，应该支援灾区农民兄弟和国家建设。天成农业社主任苏旺和说，他们在1954年也遭过灾，那时，口粮和种子都没有，以后幸亏政府从四川非灾区调给他们二十万斤口粮和一万六千斤种子，才解决了困难。他说，今年自己增了产，理应支援灾区。所以，他们除完成征购粮食的任务外，还决定再多卖五十四万斤余粮给国家。桐城县这七百多个社，还特意为这件事写了一封信，给淮北灾区的农民，表示支援他们的心意。
