Xinhua News Agency, New York, November 21st: Egyptian Foreign Minister Fawzi, who had just arrived in New York to attend the current session of the United Nations General Assembly, told reporters that the work of clearing the blocked Suez Canal cannot begin as long as British, French, and Israeli troops remain in Egypt. "The presence of the invading troops on Egyptian territory rules out any possibility of clearing the canal." He denounced the presence of British, French, and Israeli troops in Egypt as "blowing up peace—it is blowing peace to pieces."

A reporter asked whether the presence of these troops in Egypt was a direct threat to peace. Fawzi said, "That is too mild a statement; to talk about peace when these things are happening is simply an irony."

Fawzi specifically pointed out: "Israeli troops are continuing to shoot civilians living there (the Gaza Strip), while British and French troops are inspecting houses, looting, and shooting civilians in and around Port Said, blatantly disregarding the United Nations and world public opinion."

    埃及外长指出
    英法以军队不撤退就不能清理运河
    新华社21日讯　纽约消息：刚刚赶到纽约出席联合国本届大会会议的埃及外交部长法齐向记者们说：只要英、法和以色列的军队继续留在埃及，清理堵塞了的苏伊士运河的工作就不可能开始。“侵略军队继续呆在埃及领土上就排除了清理运河的一切可能性。”他斥责英法和以色列军队的呆在埃及“正在炸毁和平——它正在把和平炸光”。
    记者问，这些部队的呆在埃及是不是对和平的直接威胁。法齐说，“这是太温和的说法，在发生这些事情的时候谈和平简直是一个讽刺。”
    法齐特别指出：“以色列军队正在继续枪杀住在那里（加沙地带）的平民，而英法军队正在塞得港及其附近检查房屋，抢劫，枪杀平民，粗暴地无视联合国和世界舆论。”
