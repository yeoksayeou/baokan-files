    Talking about the Old Book Trade in Beijing
    Zhao Wanli
    The history of the old book trade in Beijing is long and distinguished. According to records, the old book trade in Beijing was very developed as far back as the Ming Dynasty. Many high-ranking officials and literati in the capital considered it a great pleasure to buy books in Liulichang. Li Wenzao's "Records of Bookstores in Liulichang" and Miao Quansun's "Continued Records of Bookstores in Liulichang" reflect the historical appearance of the old book trade in Liulichang from the mid-18th century to the 19th century. At that time, transactions were booming and there were many bookstores, far more than today. In recent decades, the old book trade in Liulichang and Longfusi has not been as prosperous as before. However, many second-hand bookstores dealing in modern publications have sprung up in the Dongcheng and Xicheng districts. Generally speaking, the number of old bookstores and people engaged in this business in Beijing today is more active than in any previous period.
    Most of the managers and employees of old bookstores have a certain level of education. They are intellectuals with some knowledge of the editions, catalogs, and main content of ancient books. The older generation in the book trade can refer to Zhang Zhidong's "Q&A on Booklists," Shao Yichen's "Annotations to the Siku Quanshu Booklist," and Mo Youzhi's "Lüting Booklist" for business study. They need to remember hundreds or even one or two thousand book titles and the categories to which these book titles belong in order to do their work. Their business knowledge comes from various sources. Because they have the opportunity to contact readers every day and constantly relate to practice, a very young apprentice can quickly master the basic knowledge. They are able to meet the needs of general scholars and try to provide rare materials of important reference value. For example, for a period of time, many people and libraries, in order to study the history between the Ming and Qing dynasties, liked to collect the first-hand materials. They were keen on searching for "prohibited books" published during the Qianlong period. They also brought out many "prohibited books," and were able to distinguish between the main and secondary ones, the common and the rare. "Planning for Liaodong and Chopping Paintings" and "The Complete Story of the Liaodong Rebellion," which were not included in the list of prohibited books, were no less important than the recorded "prohibited books," and they were also able to find and introduce them to readers. For example, for a period of time, many friends, including myself, were keen on collecting prints of past dynasties and classical novel and drama materials. They went to Shanxi, Henan, Anhui, and Xiuning provinces to search for them, and achieved great success. A man named Zhang Xiude bought a Ming dynasty woodblock printed edition of "Jin Ping Mei Ci Hua" on cotton paper in Qixian, Shanxi Province, which was a very important discovery in the history of novels. In recent years, most of the base texts in Zheng Zhenduo's "Collection of Ancient Chinese Plays" were important contributions made by the old book trade in the north and south in this regard.
    The employees of the old book trade not only worked hard to collect and sort out the classical cultural heritage, but also conducted some investigation work on revolutionary documents and modern historical materials according to the needs of readers and libraries in various places. If anyone asks about the publication era, issue numbers, and circulation status of famous periodicals such as "The Guide," "New Youth," "Oriental Magazine," and "Fiction Monthly," they can recite a set of information. These are all things they have learned on their own. Three years ago, two volumes of "Youth Magazine," printed in Paris in mimeograph around 1922, were discovered in a certain place in Ningbo. This was an early publication for Chinese people to study Marxism. They sent someone to buy it at a high price and sold it to the National Library. This is a certain contribution to academic research.
    Some of the older generation among them are rich in research spirit and can be called experts and scholars. For example, Sun Dianqi, the manager of Tongxuezhai in Beijing, is quite familiar with the works of the Qing Dynasty. He is the author of "Random Notes on Bookselling," published in 1936, in twenty volumes. I think the academic value of this book is similar to Huang Yuji's "Qianqing Hall Booklist" compiled in the early Qing Dynasty. "Qianqing Hall Booklist" is the predecessor of "Ming History · Art and Literature Chronicle." We cannot imagine what relationship Sun Dianqi's "Random Notes on Bookselling" has with "Qing History · Art and Literature Chronicle," but "Random Notes on Bookselling" is tantamount to making a summary of Qing Dynasty literature, which can be affirmed. Moreover, each book in "Random Notes on Bookselling" indicates various versions, which is very convenient for readers, and this point is much better than "Qianqing Hall Booklist." In the past ten years or so, Sun Dianqi has continued to revise and supplement it, and it is expected that the content will be more enriched when it is reprinted in the future. Another example is Zhang Junjie, the former manager of Qunyuzhai, who was originally an apprentice of Yiyatang. In the past, Yiyatang was famous for its expertise in refurbishing books. Many famous bookbinding technicians came from Yiyatang, and Zhang Junjie was one of them. He not only had excellent bookbinding skills, but was also very familiar with the works of the Ming and Qing dynasties, especially the works of the Han scholars of the Qing Dynasty. How many times a certain book was engraved? Which series of books is it included in? What are the differences between various versions? He can explain a set of principles on these issues. A few days ago, I took a volume of Yan Kejun's "Shuowen Lei Kao" to show him. As soon as he saw it, he said that it was Yan Kejun's unpublished manuscript. Sun Dianqi and Zhang Junjie have accumulated relatively correct book knowledge through long-term practical work, and therefore it is very valuable. They are in fact experts in bibliography. In addition, there are many people in the old book trade in Beijing who have good work experience and a lot of professional knowledge, and some of them are first-class talents in the old book trade in the north and south. In today's great cause of socialist transformation and construction, their strength should be fully utilized to collect more documents and materials for scientific research.
    Many employees in the old book trade have special skills in refurbishing old books. They can not only "restore old books to look like new," but more importantly, they can "restore old books to look like old," restoring them to "Song binding," "Ming binding," and "early Qing binding," representing the binding forms of Chinese books in different periods. Bookbinding is not a simple technique, it requires instruction from famous teachers and patient and meticulous learning. Most of the older employees can still bind books. Most of those under the age of thirty no longer know how to bind books due to lack of training. According to the feedback from various parties at the National Library Work Conference: many of the old books and periodicals in major libraries have reached the final juncture of "being pulverized and destroyed, and their shapes are about to disappear" due to the large increase in the number of readers in recent years. This is a serious problem. The remedies, in addition to strengthening the publicity of book protection to readers and photographing some rare editions and fragile books and periodicals into microfilms to replace reading, the more important thing is to strengthen the refurbishment work. Therefore, there is not a shortage of refurbishment technicians, but a shortage of them. I suggest that libraries that have already established refurbishment departments, such as the Beijing Library and the Nanjing Library, should continue to strengthen the refurbishment work on the existing basis. Libraries that have not established refurbishment departments, such as the Shanghai Library and the Tianjin Library, should immediately absorb refurbishment technicians to establish refurbishment departments. Because these libraries have tens of thousands of books and periodicals that urgently need refurbishment!
    Based on the above situation, the relevant leading authorities should first rely on the masses to do a good job in the investigation and research of the old book trade practitioners in Beijing. A few experts with knowledge of versions and catalogs can be absorbed into cultural departments or the National Library to engage in work, so as to get further opportunities for improvement. It is understood that the number of books and periodicals accumulated and uncompiled in libraries in Beijing, Nanjing, Shanghai and other places is about 10 million volumes. If these large quantities of accumulated books and periodicals are to be sorted out and serve scientific research in a short period of time, it is necessary to use the power of some outstanding employees in the old book trade. Cultural departments at all levels should pay attention to this work and promote its early realization. The Beijing State-owned China Bookstore is currently weak. Some personnel with strong working ability should be transferred from the joint state-private bookstores to strengthen the business and establish a leadership relationship with the joint state-private bookstores on a new basis. People in the industry should immediately start thinking and vigorously launch business competitions to buy and sell more. Actively send people to various places to purchase books, to go to big cities, but also to small and medium-sized cities and rural areas, to publicize widely, and to prevent valuable books and periodicals from flowing into paper mills or workshops that make firecrackers. Cultural institutions in various places should vigorously support and assist the purchasing staff of the book industry. At present, the cultural institutions in individual regions lack an overall concept, and instead of assisting them, they make things difficult for them. This is wrong, and the cultural departments should quickly stop it. Newly purchased books and periodicals should be sold through open negotiation by the industry. For a few valuable and rare versions, no matter how much the purchase price is, it should be evaluated higher, and conversely, it can be lower. If it is too high or too low, and someone raises an objection, it can be re-evaluated. In the current stage, the relevant leading organs should encourage various work of the old bookstores, especially the procurement work, as much as possible, and give full play to the work enthusiasm of the employees, so that they can better serve socialist cultural construction and scientific research.
    I offer these piecemeal opinions for reference by relevant parties.

    谈谈北京的古旧书业
    赵万里
    北京古旧书业的历史悠久。据记载，从明朝以来，北京的古书业就非常发达。许多京朝大官和文人学士，都以到琉璃厂买书引为无上乐事。李文藻写的“琉璃厂书肆记”和缪荃孙写的“琉璃厂书肆续记”，反映了十八世纪中叶到十九世纪琉璃厂古书业的历史面貌。那时交易繁盛，书肆众多，远非现在可及。近几十年来，琉璃厂和隆福寺的古书业不如以前兴旺了。但东西城一带，经营近代出版品的旧书店却多起来。总的说来，现在北京古旧书业的家数人数，比过去任何时期，都显得活跃了。
    古旧书店的经理和从业人员们，大多有一定的文化程度，他们都是知识分子，对于古书的版本、目录和主要内容，也有一定的认识。书业中老一辈人，能参考张之洞的“书目答问”，邵懿辰的“四库书目标注”，莫友芝的“郘亭书目”，进行业务学习。他们要记住几百个乃至一、二千个书名和这些书名的所属门类，才能从事工作。他们的业务知识，是从多方面吸取来的，由于天天有机会和读者接触，不断联系实际，一个年纪很轻的学徒，很快就能掌握基本知识。他们能够适应一般学者的需要，设法供应稀有的和有重要参考价值的资料。例如有一个时期，有不少人和图书馆为了研究明、清之间的历史，寻找第一手资料，都欢喜搜集乾隆年间公布的“禁书”，他们也跟着搬出许多“禁书”来，而且能够区别其中主要的和次要的，易见的和罕见的。没有列入禁书书目的“筹辽砍画”，“辽变会议始末”，其重要性不亚于著录的“禁书”，他们也能设法搜集和介绍给读者。又如有一个时期，许多朋友包括我也在内，热衷于搜集历代版画和古典小说戏曲资料。他们就纷纷到山西、河南等省和徽州、休宁等地搜访，得到很多成绩。有一个名叫张修德的，在山西祁县买到一部明刻棉纸印本“金瓶梅词话”，这是小说史上一个极重要的发现。近年郑振铎主编的“古本戏曲丛刊”，其中大部分底本，就是当时南北古书业对这方面的重要贡献。
    古旧书业的从业人员们，不仅努力于古典文化遗产的搜集和整理工作，对于革命文献、近代史料，也因各地读者和图书馆的需要，进行过一些调查工作。他们对于“向导”、“新青年”、“东方杂志”、“小说月报”等等著名期刊的出版时代、期数、流传情况，如果有人问到，他们也能够背诵一套。这些，都是他们自己摸索出来的。三年前，宁波某地发现了二册远在1922年前后巴黎油印出版的“少年杂志”，这是中国人研究马克思主义的早期刊物。他们派人前去高价买来，售给国家图书馆。这对学术研究工作是有一定贡献的。
    他们中间老一辈人，也有富于钻研精神，称得起专家学者的。例如北京通学斋经理孙殿起，他对于清人著作，相当熟悉。他著有“贩书偶记”二十卷，出版于1936年。我认为这部书的学术价值，同清初黄虞稷编的“千顷堂书目”相类似。“千顷堂书目”就是“明史艺文志”的前身，我们不能想像孙殿起的“贩书偶记”和“清史艺文志”有什么关系；但“贩书偶记”无异于替清代艺文作了一次总结，那是可以肯定的。而且“贩书偶记”中各书，都注明各种版本，对于读者非常便利，这一点要比“千顷堂书目”高明得多。最近十几年来孙殿起又陆续加以修正和补充，将来再版时内容将更见充实，那是可以预期的。又如前群玉斋经理张俊杰，原是肄雅堂的徒弟。过去肄雅堂以善于装修书籍出名，许多著名的装书技术工人，多是肄雅堂出身，张俊杰就是其中之一。他不仅有一副装书的好手艺，对于明、清两代著作，尤其是清代汉学家的著作，非常熟悉。某种书刻了多少次？收在哪类丛书里？各种版本之间，有些什么不同？在这些问题上，能说出一套道理来。前些天我拿了一册严可均著的“说文类考”给他看，他一见就说这是严可均未刻的稿本。孙殿起和张俊杰在实际工作中长期积累起来的书本知识，是比较正确的，因而是很值得宝贵的。他们事实上都是目录学的专家。此外北京古旧书业中还有不少的人，有很好的工作经验和很多的专业知识，其中有些人都是南北古旧书业中第一流人才。在今天社会主义改造和建设的伟大事业中，应该充分发挥他们的力量，来为科学研究采获更多的文献和资料。
    古旧书业中有不少从业人员有装修古旧书籍的特殊技术。他们不仅能够“整旧如新”，更重要的还能“整旧如旧”，恢复到“宋装”、“明装”、“清初装”，代表着中国书各个不同时期的装订形式。装书不是简单的技术，需要名师传授和耐心细致地学习。现在年老的从业人员，大部分还能装书。三十岁以下的，因为缺乏锻炼，多数已经不会装书了。根据全国图书馆工作会议中各方面反映：各大图书馆的古旧书刊，因为近年借阅人次大量增加，有很多书刊已经到了“粉身碎骨，形将消灭”的最后关头。这是个严重问题。补救的办法，除了应该向阅览人员加强爱护图书的宣传工作，把一部分罕见本和纸质脆薄容易破损的书刊照成显微缩影，代替阅览以外，更重要的是加强装修工作。所以目前装修技工，不是嫌其多，而是嫌其少。我建议：各地已经成立装修部的图书馆，例如北京图书馆、南京图书馆，在现有基础上，应该继续加强装修工作。没有成立装修部的图书馆，如上海图书馆、天津图书馆，应该立即吸收装修技工成立装修部。因为这些图书馆，有成千上万的书刊，迫切需要装修啊！
    根据上述情况，有关领导机关，首先应该依靠群众，做好北京古旧书业从业人员的调查研究工作。对于少数有版本目录知识的专家，可以吸收到文化部门或国家图书馆从事工作，以便得到进一步提高的机会。据了解，现在北京、南京、上海各地图书馆积压未编的书刊，达一千万册左右。这些大量被积压的书刊，在短期间如果要设法整理出来为科学研究服务，必须利用古旧书业中一部分优秀从业人员的力量。各级文化部门，应该重视这个工作，促其尽快实现。北京国营中国书店目前力量较弱，应该从公私合营书店中抽调一部分工作能力强的人员来加强业务，在新的基础上建立起和公私合营书店的领导关系。同业中应即开动脑筋，大力展开业务竞赛，多买多卖。积极派人到各地去采购图书，要到大城市去，也要到中小城市和乡间去，广为宣传，防止各地有价值的书刊流入造纸厂或制造爆竹的作坊中去。各地文化机关对于书业采购工作人员应大力予以支持和协助。现在个别地区的文化机关，缺乏整体观念，不但不协助他们，反而留难他们，这是不对的，文化部门要迅速予以制止。新购进的书刊，应该通过同业公开议价再行发卖。对于少数有价值的罕见的版本，不管买价多少，应该评高些，相反，可以低些。如果偏高偏低，有人提出异议，可以重评。有关领导机关在现阶段内，对于古旧书店的各项工作，尤其是采购工作，应该多鼓励，尽量发挥从业人员的工作积极性，以便他们更多地为社会主义文化建设和科学研究服务。
    我提出这些零碎意见供有关方面参考。
