    On Writing Books and Ramen
    Chen Yan

    Books are written, but some books are "pulled" out. For example, someone writes an article in a newspaper or magazine, and a comrade from a publishing house comes along and asks him to "expand" the article to become a book. For example, expand from three or four thousand words to about twenty thousand words, so that a book can be printed. Some pamphlets are produced in this way.

    Naturally, some short articles are written concisely, or are just outlines, and with much more effort, can be expanded into a book with substantial content. However, some articles are not like this; the point has already been made, or almost made, and if you insist on pulling, you have to use a pair of scissors and a bottle of paste, select some materials from newspapers and foreign novels as examples, insert them into the original manuscript, and paste and paste, and it becomes a book.

    These "book-pullers" often complain: "There's no way! The publishing houses are really pushing hard, there's really no way." These authors seem to have great grievances. But, we are reminded of Mr. Lu Xun. Mr. Lu Xun said: "Rather shrink material suitable for a novel into a Sketch, than pull Sketch material into a novel." However, some of our authors prefer to "pull" an article into a book. The process of producing a book like this is like the ramen noodles eaten by northerners. At first, it is a ball of dough, and after pulling left and right, it becomes longer and longer, but also thinner and thinner. The total amount is still the original ball of dough, which is a pity, it has not increased!

    Why are publishing houses so inconsiderate? It is said that publishing houses also have great grievances. It is said that one of the important criteria for evaluating publishing houses is the number of book titles published each year. In order to realize this "the more the better" principle, some publishing houses have to actively "pull" manuscripts from all sides. The "pulling" of publishing houses promotes the "pulling" of certain authors.

    I wonder what the organization leading these publishing houses thinks about this?

    谈写书和拉面
    陈言
    书是写出来的，但是，也有些书却是“拉”出来的。例如，有人在报上或杂志上写了一篇文章，就会有出版社的同志来了，请他把这篇文章“扩大”，以便成为一本书。例如，由三、四千字扩大为两万字左右，这样便可以印一本书了。有些小册子就由此而产生。
    自然，有些短文，写得简练，或只是提纲，再付出许多劳动，是可以扩大写成一本内容充实的书的。但是，有些文章则不然，话已经说尽了，或差不多说尽了，硬要拉，只好用一把剪刀，一瓶浆糊，选些报纸上和外国小说里的材料，作为例子，插到原稿中去，贴呀贴的，就成了一本书了。
    这些“拉”书者常常诉苦道：“没有法子呀！出版社抓得真紧，真是没有法子。”看起来，这些作者似乎真有好大苦衷似的。可是，我们想起鲁迅先生来了。鲁迅先生说：“宁可将可作小说的材料缩成Sketch（速写），决不将Sketch材料拉成小说。”可是，我们有些作者，偏爱把一篇文章“拉”成一本书。书的这种产生过程，真有如北方人吃的拉面，起初是一团面，经过左拉右拉，越拉越长，可是也越拉越细。总分量呢，还是原来那一团面，很可惜，并没有增加！
    出版社又为何如此之不体谅人呢？据说，出版社也大有苦衷哩。据说，出版社的考绩的重要标准之一，就是每年出书的种数。为了实现这条“多多益善”的原则，有的出版社只好四出积极“拉”稿了。出版社的“拉”，就促进了某些作者的“拉”。
    不知领导这种出版社的机关对此有何看法呢？
