A Joyous Festival
    ——Remembering the Chinese Art Troupe in Brazil——
    Jorge Amado
    The Chinese Art Troupe concluded its tour of Brazil with a closing performance at the São Paulo Municipal Theater for a large and enthusiastic audience (which was broadcast on television). It stayed in Rio de Janeiro for fifteen days and in São Paulo for fifteen days, but this month cannot be measured by the usual scale of time. This visit by the art envoys of the People's Republic of China showed the great significance it holds for developing friendship between our two countries and for carrying out cultural exchanges in service of international peace and the cause of peaceful coexistence among nations.
    Brazil and the People's Republic of China do not have diplomatic or trade relations, but maintain such relations with the Taiwan government. However, this is only an artificially created position, a product of the policies of previous governments that have built their policies on the basis of the Cold War, thereby tethering our country to the chariot of American imperialism. However, today, due to the evolution of the international situation, the growing influence of the national bourgeoisie within the government, and especially due to the struggles of the masses, the government's foreign policy is beginning to show initial signs of change, moving towards an independent policy, which is what broad strata of the Brazilian people demand, even including certain factions of the ruling class.
    There is an intense struggle underway between patriotic forces and those closely colluding with American imperialism (that is, what we call "traitorous forces" here). This domestic situation is even reflected in the attitude towards the Chinese Art Troupe. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs initially decided to refuse entry visas to the Chinese artists, a practice that served the interests of reactionary forces in the government and was a result of succumbing to pressure from the U.S. State Department. This decision immediately aroused fierce opposition from public opinion, forcing the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to concede. Figures in the cultural world issued angry protests, even including some who were considered right-wing. The momentum of this movement was so great that, as a result, forty-eight hours later, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was forced to issue visas and issued a statement expressing goodwill towards the Chinese Art Troupe.
    During the days the art troupe stayed in Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo, the artists encountered enthusiasm and friendship everywhere. The Brazilian people, intellectuals, and prominent Brazilian political and economic figures warmly and cordially received them. Although the leaders and artists of the Chinese Art Troupe strictly limited their activities to the scope of a cultural delegation, prominent figures in Brazilian political and economic circles also expressed interest and goodwill towards the experience of People's China when welcoming the artists.
    On the other hand, it can be said that the artists of the Chinese Art Troupe were semi-official guests of the Brazilian government. The Presidential Palace of the Republic, the São Paulo State Government, the Ministry of Education and Culture, the Federal Senate and House of Representatives, and the municipal governments of Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo all cordially received the Chinese artists. Visits from some of Brazil's most important political figures, as well as their remarks, demonstrated how interested responsible figures in Brazil are in studying China's experience. This welcome and cordiality demonstrate a serious defeat for those most reactionary colonialists. On the other hand, the indescribable artistic achievements of the Chinese Art Troupe helped to expand the circle of people friendly to People's China among all sectors of our country.
    From the perspective of cultural exchange between the People's Republic of China and Brazil, the visit of the Chinese Art Troupe is of extreme significance. When the Minister of Education and Culture gave an interview to the cultural bi-monthly "Everybody Sees," he said that the Chinese Art Troupe was a "troupe so good that it could not be bettered," and its tour was "a truly momentous social event, making people think about it constantly." In two issues of the same magazine, thirty of the most famous Brazilian intellectuals, led by the President of the University of Brazil and the Dean of the Faculty of Arts, wrote extremely laudatory articles about the Chinese Art Troupe. In different ways, these articles all called for extensive cultural exchange between our two peoples. Theater director Mario Brasini wrote that the arrival of the Chinese Art Troupe in Brazil "marks the beginning of a new era in Brazil's cultural relations with the rest of the world." The artistic achievements of the art troupe's performances were warmly celebrated by the most famous music and drama critics, poets, novelists, and actors, playing a huge role in strengthening cultural exchange. In this regard, there were some moving scenes during the Chinese artists' stay here: "Everybody Sees" magazine held a celebration at the Rio de Janeiro Club, where Brazilian and Chinese artists joined in the festivities, and Brazil's most famous folk music and dance masters performed for the Chinese artists; the leaders of the art troupe visited some Brazilian theaters; Brazilian and Chinese artists quickly established warm friendships, and then often had lunch, dinner, and meetings together.
    Under the auspices of the First Lady of the Republic, the Chinese Art Troupe performed at the Maracanã Stadium in Rio de Janeiro, which can hold 25,000 people. That day, the entire stadium was packed. On this unforgettable Sunday, Chinese artists gathered with the Brazilian people, and no one who watched this performance can forget this day. The hundreds of thousands of people gathered together warmly and friendly welcomed the art envoys of ancient but young and creative China, welcoming the representatives sent by the great Chinese people who have forever broken free from the shackles of oppression.
    For strengthening Sino-Brazilian friendship, the arrival of the Chinese Art Troupe represents the realization of people's wishes and hopes. Through the visit of the Chinese Art Troupe, the Brazilian people were able to express their love, admiration, and support for People's China, and the Chinese artists were able to fully appreciate the love they received and express the Chinese people's respect and concern for our people.
    The month that the Chinese Art Troupe stayed here was a month of celebration for the intellectuals and people of Brazil's two largest cities, a series of unforgettable and joyous festivals, all of which served the cause of art, drama, beauty, friendship among peoples, the cause of peace, and the cause of life. The Chinese Art Troupe will depart to other countries. People's eyes are filled with tears of reluctance, and everyone's heart is filled with gratitude. Friends of the Chinese Art Troupe, thank you!

    欢庆的节日
    ——记中国艺术团在巴西——
    若热·亚马多
    中国艺术团在圣保罗市立剧院向广大和热情的观众演出一场闭幕式（这一场由电视播送），从而结束在巴西的旅行演出。它在里约热内卢停留了十五天，在圣保罗也停留了十五天，但这一个月的时间，是不能用通常衡量时间的尺度来衡量的。中华人民共和国艺术使节们的这次访问，显示了它对发展我们两国友谊，开展为国际和平与各国和平共处事业服务的文化交流是具有多么重大的意义。
    巴西和中华人民共和国没有外交或贸易关系，而是和台湾政府保持这种关系。但是，这只是一种人为造成的立场，它是以前历届政府的方针的产物，那些政府一直把自己的政策建筑在冷战的基础上，从而把我们祖国拴上美帝国主义的战车。不过，今天由于国际局势的演变，由于民族资产阶级在政府内部的影响的增长，特别是由于群众的斗争，政府的对外政策开始表现出改变的初步迹象，朝向一种独立的政策，而这正是巴西广泛的各阶层人民所要求的，甚至包括统治阶级的某些派别在内。
    在爱国力量和那些与美帝国主义紧紧勾结的势力（也就是我们这里所说的“卖国力量”）之间正在进行着激烈的斗争，这样一种国内形势，甚至也反映在对中国艺术团的态度上。外交部起初决定拒绝给中国艺术家们入境签证，这样一种做法，是为政府中反动势力的利益服务的，而且也是对美国国务院的压力屈服的结果。这种决定立即引起公众舆论剧烈反对，迫使外交部让步。文化界人士发出了愤怒的抗议，参加抗议的甚至有一些被人认为是右派的人物。这个运动声势浩大，结果四十八小时后，外交部就被迫发给签证，并发表了一份声明，声明中对中国艺术团表示好感。
    艺术团在里约热内卢和圣保罗逗留的日子里，艺术家们到处遇到热情和友谊，巴西人民、知识分子以及巴西著名的政治和经济界人物热烈而亲切地接待他们。虽然中国艺术团的领导人和艺术家把自己的行动严格局限在一个文化代表团的范围之内，但巴西的政治和经济界知名人士在欢迎艺术家们的时候，也对人民中国的经验表示了兴趣和好感。
    另一方面，可以说中国艺术团的艺术家们是巴西政府的半官方客人，共和国总统府、圣保罗州政府、教育文化部、联邦参议院和众议院、里约热内卢和圣保罗的市政府，都殷勤接待了中国的艺术家。巴西一些最重要的政界人物的访问，以及这些人物的言论，都说明了巴西的一些负有责任的人物对研究中国的经验是多么感到兴趣。这种欢迎和这种殷勤，说明了那些最反动的殖民主义分子遭受到严重的失败。另一方面，中国艺术团的难以形容的艺术成就，有助于在我国所有各界人士当中扩大对人民中国友好的人们的范围。
    从中华人民共和国与巴西之间文化交流的角度来看，中国艺术团的访问，意义是极为重大的。教育文化部长对文化性的半月刊“大家看”发表谈话的时候说，中国艺术团是一个“好到无以复加的剧团”，它的旅行演出是“一件名符其实的社会大事，使人为之念念不忘”。在同一份杂志的两期上，三十位最出名的巴西知识分子，以巴西大学校长和文学学院院长为首，都写了一些对中国艺术团极为称赞的文章，这些文章都各以不同的方式，要求在我们两国人民之间广泛展开文化交流。戏剧导演马里奥·布拉辛尼写道，中国艺术团来到巴西，“标志着巴西与世界其他地区的文化关系，一个新时代的开始。”艺术团的演出所取得的艺术成就，受到了最著名的音乐与戏剧批评家、诗人、小说家、演员的热烈庆贺，对于加强文化交流，起了巨大的推动作用。在这一方面，在中国艺术家在我们这里停留的期间，曾经有过一些使人感动的场面：“大家看”杂志社在里约热内卢俱乐部举行了一次庆祝会，巴中两国的艺术家在会上联欢，巴西最著名的民间音乐与舞蹈大师们在会上为中国艺术家表演；艺术团的领导人访问了巴西的一些剧院；巴中两国艺术家很快就建立了热烈的友谊，接着彼此就常常一起午餐、晚餐与会面。
    在共和国总统夫人的主持下，中国艺术团在里约热内卢可容二万五千人的马拉加尼亚运动场演出。这一天全场挤得水泄不通。在这一个令人难忘的星期日，中国艺术家们跟巴西人民相聚在一起，每一个观看了这次演出的人，谁也不能够忘记这一天。成千上万聚集在一起的人们，热烈而友好地欢迎古老但又年青而富有创造性的中国的艺术使节们，欢迎永远摆脱了压迫枷锁的伟大的中国人民派来的代表。
    对加强中巴友谊来说，中国艺术团的来临，表示人们的心愿和希望得到了实现。通过中国艺术团的访问，巴西人们得以表达他们对人民中国的热爱、钦佩和支援，中国艺术家们能够充分体会到他们所受到的热爱，而且也能表达了中国人民对我国人民的重视和关心。
    中国艺术团在这里停留的一个月，对巴西两个最大城市的知识分子和人民来说，是一个欢庆的月份，是一些难忘的欢乐的节日，这些节日的目的，都是为艺术、戏剧、美、各国人民友谊的事业，为和平的事业，为生命的事业服务。中国艺术团将出发到其他国家去。人们的眼睛里都含着依依不舍的泪水，人人的心里都充满感激的心情。中国艺术团的朋友们，谢谢你们！
