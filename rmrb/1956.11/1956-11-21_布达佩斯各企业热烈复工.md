Xinhua News Agency, Prague, November 20th: According to a report by the Czechoslovak News Agency on the resumption of work by Budapest workers on November 19th, the characteristic of Budapest enterprises on that day was a vigorous resumption of work. After the city's normal life was suspended for more than three weeks, the machines of larger factories started turning again on the 19th, and the chimneys were smoking again. At the main workers' center, the Csepel Iron and Steel Works, all eighteen departments of the factory had started work. All the workshops of the Beloiannisz Factory, which produces telecommunications equipment, have resumed work. Transportation for workers going to and from work still has difficulties. On the morning of the 19th, the workers' committee held discussions with the employees to study all necessary measures to accelerate the restoration of normal production. During the lunch break, the factory workers gathered for meetings, with about 60% of the workers present agreeing with the views of the workers' committee and unanimously expressing their support for resuming work.

The Czechoslovak News Agency reporter also visited a factory that produces cables and other products. The workers of this factory protected the factory, so it was not damaged. However, many workers' homes were destroyed or damaged. In this factory, 50% of the work has been restored. However, there is a lack of coal and raw materials. At the "Gama" factory, workers assured reporters that they never wanted to restore capitalism and that they would know how to establish order. They intend to organize workers' self-defense forces.

    布达佩斯各企业热烈复工
    据新华社布拉格20日电　据捷克斯洛伐克通讯社报道11月19日布达佩斯工人复工的情况说，布达佩斯各企业这一天的生活的特色是热烈地复工。这个城市的正常生活停顿了三个多星期后，较大工厂的机轮在19日又开始转动，烟囱又冒烟了。在主要的工人中心——切佩尔钢铁厂，工厂的所有十八个部门都开工了。生产电讯设备的贝劳扬尼斯工厂的全部车间都已经恢复工作。运送工人上下班的交通工具还有困难。19日上午，工人委员会同职工们进行了讨论，研究了加速恢复正常生产的一切必要措施。在午饭的间歇时间，工厂的工人们聚集起来开会，到场的工人中有60％左右赞同工人委员会的观点，并且一致表示赞成复工。
    捷克斯洛伐克通讯社记者还访问了一家生产电缆等产品的工厂。这个工厂的工人保护了工厂，因而没有受到破坏。但是，许多工人的住房都被毁了或者损坏了。在这个工厂里也有50％的工作已经恢复。但是，缺乏煤和原料。在“加马”工厂，工人们向记者保证，他们从来不希望恢复资本主义，他们会知道如何建立秩序。他们打算组织工人自卫队。
