Xinhua News Agency, 13th: At the National Congress of Socialist Construction Activists of Revolutionary Martyrs' Families, Military Dependents, Disabled Soldiers, and Demobilized Soldiers, twelve model revolutionary martyrs' families and military dependents reported to the congress on the glorious deeds of encouraging their relatives to join the revolutionary army or actively participate in various tasks over the three days of the 10th, 12th, and 13th.

Chen Cuichang, a revolutionary martyr's family member and military dependent from Shanghai, is the mother of eight children, five of whom have joined the Chinese People's Liberation Army successively. In 1939, when Japanese imperialism invaded China, Chen Cuichang encouraged her eldest son to join the New Fourth Army in the old base area of northern Jiangsu. Soon after, her eldest son gloriously sacrificed himself in a battle. When Chen Cuichang heard the news of her son's sacrifice, she felt very sad, but at the same time, she hated the enemy even more and resolved to turn grief into strength. In 1941, she sent her third son to join the New Fourth Army, and in 1946, her second son joined the Eighth Route Army. After the nationwide liberation, Chen Cuichang encouraged her fourth daughter and fifth son to join the army. In peacetime, she constantly encouraged her sons to improve their skills and defend the motherland. Now she only has one youngest son left. Chen Cuichang is a representative of the Shanghai People's Congress and a member of the District People's Committee. She is already fifty-four years old this year, but she still strives to learn culture and politics. She originally had a very low level of education, but now she can read newspapers and take notes.

Jin Yingshu, a military dependent from Jilin Province, is the deputy leader and Party branch secretary of the Panshi County Youth Voluntary Reclamation Team. She often cares about the lives of the team members. When she saw that the team members were tired from work, she would take the initiative to heat the kang and fetch water for them to wash their faces. When she saw that team member Zhang Shufang had no shoes to wear, she used her only remaining money to buy her a pair of shoes. With her help, the team members' enthusiasm for work became higher and higher. Jin Yingshu also cherishes public property very much. Once, a fire broke out in the kitchen, and it was about to burn the grain. Jin Yingshu soaked her newly bought blanket in water and covered the grain, and as a result, the grain was not damaged at all. After half a year, she and the captain led the team members to overcome many difficulties, and now the reclamation team has been consolidated.

In the speeches at the conference over these three days, there were also eight disabled soldiers and demobilized soldiers.

On the 10th, Hu Xiudao, a specially invited representative of the People's Liberation Army, and Wei Shaomin, a specially invited representative of the Volunteer Army, spoke at the meeting. They reported in detail on the work, study, and life in the army. They said, "We are very honored to meet all of you relatives at this meeting. We must respond to the care and hope of our relatives with practical actions."

    积极分子们报告模范事迹
    据新华社13日讯　全国烈属、军属、残废军人、复员军人社会主义建设积极分子大会在10日、12日、13日的三天中，共有十二位模范烈属、军属向大会报告了他们鼓励亲人参加革命军队或积极参加各项工作的光荣事迹。
    上海市烈属、军属陈翠嫦是八个孩子的妈妈，其中五个孩子都先后参加了中国人民解放军。1939年当日本帝国主义侵略中国的时候，陈翠嫦就鼓励她的大儿子到苏北老根据地去参加新四军。不久，她的大儿子在一次战斗中光荣地牺牲了。当陈翠嫦听到儿子牺牲的消息时心里很难受，同时她更加仇恨敌人，决心要化悲痛为力量。1941年她又把三儿子送去参加了新四军，1946年他的二儿子参加了八路军。全国解放后，陈翠嫦又鼓励四女儿和五儿子参军。她在平时，还不断鼓励她的儿子，提高本领，保卫祖国。现在她身边只剩下一个最小的儿子。陈翠嫦是上海市人民代表和区人民委员会委员，今年已经五十四岁了，但她还努力学习文化和政治。她本来文化程度很低，现在已经能看报做记录了。
    吉林省军属金英淑是磐石县青年志愿垦荒队的副队长、党的支部书记。她经常关心队员们的生活，当她看到队员们干活很累，他就主动地给他们烧炕、打洗脸水。当她看到队员张树芳没有鞋穿时，她就用自己仅剩的几个钱给她买双鞋。队员们在她的帮助下，工作热情越来越高。金英淑还非常爱护公共财物，有一次厨房失火，眼看就要烧上粮食，金英淑就把自己新买的毯子沾上水把粮食盖上，结果粮食一点也没有受到损失。垦荒队经过半年的时间，她和队长一齐，领导队员克服了不少困难，现在垦荒队已经得到巩固。
    在这三天大会发言中还有八位残废军人和复员军人。
    10日，解放军特邀代表胡修道和志愿军特邀代表魏绍民在会上讲了话。他们在会上详细地报告了部队工作、学习和生活上的情况。他们说，在这个会上我们见到了各位亲人，感到非常光荣。我们一定要用实际行动来回答亲人对我们的关怀和希望。
