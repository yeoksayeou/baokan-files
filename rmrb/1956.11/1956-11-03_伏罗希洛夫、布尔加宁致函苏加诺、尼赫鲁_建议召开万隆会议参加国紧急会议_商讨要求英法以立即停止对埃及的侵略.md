Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 2nd: The Director of the Information Department of the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ilyichev, stated at a press conference on November 1st that the Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, Voroshilov, and the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, Bulganin, had sent letters to Indonesian President Sukarno and Indian Prime Minister Nehru, respectively, regarding the armed aggression against Egypt.

Bulganin's letter to Nehru specifically pointed out that the use of force against Egypt by Britain, France, and Israel is an act of aggression and a blatant violation of the United Nations Charter and the principles of the Bandung Conference. This behavior has created a situation fraught with far-reaching consequences that endanger world peace and security.

The letter stated that in the current situation, it would be best to convene an emergency meeting of the participating countries of the Bandung Conference so that the participating countries can demand that Britain, France, and Israel immediately cease their armed intervention in Egypt and immediately withdraw their troops from Egyptian territory.

Voroshilov's letter to President Sukarno also pointed out that it would be best to convene a meeting of the participating countries of the Bandung Conference regarding the aggression against Egypt.

Ilyichev said that the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, Bulganin, has sent a letter to U.S. President Eisenhower regarding the armed aggression against Egypt.
