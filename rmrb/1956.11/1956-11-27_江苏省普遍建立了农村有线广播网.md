Xinhua News Agency report: Jiangsu Province has universally established a rural wired broadcasting network. Of the 71 counties in the province, 64 rural and county-level wired broadcasting stations have been established, with over 11,000 loudspeakers installed. The majority of these loudspeakers are installed in district and township people's committees and agricultural production cooperatives.

The rural broadcasting stations in various regions have played a significant role in imparting agricultural techniques and mobilizing the vast number of farmers to promptly carry out flood prevention, flood control, drainage, and typhoon resistance. After listening to the broadcasts in the townships or agricultural cooperatives, thousands upon thousands of propagandists in the rural areas told the broad masses of farmers about the daily weather forecasts and production knowledge reported by the loudspeakers by discussing production and chatting about everyday life, helping them arrange production. Now, some rural women even listen to the weather forecast before washing clothes and drying grain.

Jiangsu Province convened the province's Second Wired Broadcasting Work Conference from the 16th to the 23rd. Representatives from various regions exchanged experiences in wired broadcasting work in Nanjing, and studied how to further improve the quality of broadcast programs and use rich and colorful broadcast content to meet the needs of the vast number of farmers.

    江苏省普遍建立了农村有线广播网
    据新华社讯　江苏省普遍建立了农村有线广播网。全省七十一个县中，目前已经建立了六十四座农村、县城有线广播站，安装好的广播喇叭达一万一千多只。这些广播喇叭大部分装在区、乡人民委员会和农业生产合作社里。
    各地的农村广播站，在传授农业技术和动员广大农民及时进行防汛、防洪、排涝、抗御台风等工作中，发挥了重大的作用。各地农村里成千上万的宣传员在乡里或农业社里听了广播以后，通过和农民谈生产、谈家常，把每天广播喇叭报告的气象预报、生产知识等告诉广大农民，帮助他们安排生产。现在有些农村妇女洗衣服、晒粮食等都要先来听气象预报。
    江苏省在16日到23日召开了全省第二次有线广播工作会议，各地代表在南京交流了有线广播工作的经验，研究进一步提高广播节目的质量，用丰富多采的广播内容来满足广大农民的需要。
