Xinhua News Agency Report: People across the country have resolutely expressed their willingness to go to Egypt and fight alongside their Egyptian brothers against the Anglo-French aggressors.

	Many workers and cadres in various regions have stated their willingness to temporarily leave their beloved machines and current work positions to take up arms and join the ranks of the Egyptian people's struggle. Lin Youhua, a female driver on the Yangtze River, said, "If I am needed in Egypt, I am willing to give my life to resist the aggressors." Li Hechun, who formerly served as a captain in the People's Liberation Army Navy and now works on the Yangtze River, despite being fifty years old, repeatedly expressed his desire to go to Egypt and participate in the anti-aggression struggle. Workers in the B shift of the coal washing workshop at the Beijing Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant stated: "If the Anglo-French-Israeli aggressor troops do not withdraw from Egypt, we will volunteer to take up arms and go to Egypt to help the Egyptian people drive them out." On November 8th, Ma Rongfu, a technician at the Beijing Second Automobile Transportation Company, went to the Egyptian Embassy in China to express his desire to sign up for the volunteer army to Egypt. Many railway workers in Chongqing expressed their determination to volunteer to go to Egypt to participate in transportation work. Gao Wenxiang, a driver who participated in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, and more than twenty others, jointly wrote a letter of determination requesting the organization of a railway worker volunteer team to go to Egypt. Tractor drivers in the suburbs of Fuzhou and the Yueyang Tractor Station on the shores of Dongting Lake stated that they were willing to temporarily put down their tractors and go to Egypt to drive tanks to fight the enemy. Zhang Shuyun, a female tractor driver from Jiaoxian County, Shandong Province, also expressed the same desire. Cao Dianqiu, the curator of the Hunan Provincial Museum of Culture and History, said: "Looking west across the sea, we are ready and waiting. When the time comes, I am willing to be an old soldier."

	Vast numbers of medical workers in Shanghai, Tianjin, Liaoning, Shaanxi, Gansu, Shanxi, Hunan, Yunnan, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Guangdong and other provinces and cities are determined to organize medical teams to provide medical assistance to the Egyptian people. In Shanghai, more than a thousand medical personnel had signed volunteer forms before the 10th. In Changsha City, Hunan Province alone, 1,000 medical workers signed up on the 12th requesting the organization of a volunteer medical team for Egypt. Wang Jingjing, a young nurse at the Affiliated Hospital of Hunan Medical College, wrote in her letter of determination requesting to go to Egypt: I am a nurse, and I have recently learned to shoot. Both of these skills can support the Egyptian people. The forty-six students in the "Guliya Class" of Changsha Health School stated that they are willing to go to the front line of the anti-imperialist struggle in Egypt as white-clad warriors if necessary. Several hundred teachers and students from Nanchang Nursing School and Jiangxi Pharmaceutical School in Jiangxi Province have signed up to form a blood transfusion team, ready to use their blood to save Egyptian wounded.

	Many youth, students, and teachers in various regions have put forward the slogan of being ready to exchange their pens for swords at any time to support the Egyptian people. Students from more than twenty classes in Beijing Normal University collectively requested to go to Egypt to participate in the struggle. A large number of students from Northwest Normal College, Northwest College of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine, Lanzhou University and other schools have signed their names on volunteer forms "to fight alongside the Egyptian people on the banks of the Nile." Zhejiang Normal College wrote a letter to Cairo University, saying, "We are willing to use our blood to support you." Many students in Jilin, Shandong, and other places are working hard to exercise in preparation to go to Egypt at any time.

	Veterans and construction servicemen in various regions have expressed their willingness to take up arms again and go to Egypt to defend world peace. Duan Guoqiang and twenty-three other employees of a technical school in Sichuan Province stated: "We volunteered to go to Korea and joined the Korean people in extinguishing the flames ignited by the aggressors. Not long ago, we returned to our production posts, but the Anglo-French aggressors ignited the flames of war in Egypt. We are willing to volunteer to go to Egypt and join the Egyptian people in extinguishing the flames of war." Yu Huaizhong, who participated in the War of Resistance Against Japan, the War of Liberation, and the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, and now works at the Gucheng Tractor Station in Keshan County, Heilongjiang Province, resolutely expressed his desire to take up arms again and go to Egypt.

	Muslims in various regions have also expressed their desire to go to Egypt to support their Muslim brothers. Thirty-one young workers from a machinery factory in Jilin Province, who are believers in Islam, jointly expressed their desire to go to Egypt to resist the aggressors. Fifty-one Ahongs in Shandong Province who are currently studying expressed their determination to support Egypt. Ahong Li Wenming said excitedly, "I am willing to take my three children to support our Muslim brothers in Egypt." Ahong Wang Changshun and others, who once participated in the Chinese Islamic Hajj delegation to Egypt, requested to go to Egypt to join the ranks of supporting the Egyptian Muslim brothers in the anti-aggression struggle.

	The Shaanxi Provincial Opera Theatre, the Qinqiang Film Art Committee, and the Opera Directing Workshop began a charity performance in Xi'an on the 10th to support Egypt. The Northwest University Student Drama Troupe also held a charity performance at the People's Theatre to support the Egyptian people.
