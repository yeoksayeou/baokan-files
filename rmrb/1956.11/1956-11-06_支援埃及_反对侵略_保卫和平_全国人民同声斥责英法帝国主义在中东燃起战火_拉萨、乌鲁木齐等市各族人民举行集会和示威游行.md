Xinhua News Agency, November 5th: The entire nation of China is unanimously condemning British and French imperialism for igniting a new war in the Middle East, expressing the greatest concern and support for the Egyptian people's just struggle against aggression. In just a few days, hundreds of millions of people across the country have launched a massive wave of support for Egypt, opposition to aggression, and defense of peace.

　　In recent days, people throughout the country have been in a state of fervor, with people from all walks of life holding rallies and demonstrations. More than thirty large and medium-sized cities have successively held large-scale demonstrations involving tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of people. In the past three days alone, two million people have participated in demonstrations. Residents of many rural towns have also held rallies. In the remote borderlands of Tibet, the Zhoushan Islands, the Yichun forest area, the Qaidam Basin, and the Karamay mining area, workers, peasants, herdsmen, and people from all walks of life have held rallies and demonstrations. There has been a phenomenon of people rushing to buy newspapers everywhere. Radios and wired broadcasting stations in public places in cities and villages are often surrounded by large groups of people listening to news about Egypt. In many cities, propagandists and young students voluntarily conduct propaganda for the masses. Crowds of people discussing the situation in Egypt can be seen everywhere in the streets. Everyone is watching the development of the situation in the Middle East.

　　In Harbin, a 52-year-old mother, Yuan Hongjun, cried when she heard the news and recalled the tragic scene of the Japanese imperialist invasion and massacre in China. But she firmly said: "In order to prevent Egyptian mothers from living a painful life like we did back then, I am willing to contribute my strength. I am prepared to save a little pocket money every day to support the people of Egypt and the mothers of Egypt." The worries and determination of this Harbin mother express the feelings of Chinese mothers.

　　People on all fronts have put forward various support methods, expressing their desire to support the Egyptian people's struggle in accordance with their best wishes. The Egyptian Embassy in China has received more than 2,000 letters of support from all over the country in the past four days. Workers at Anshan Iron and Steel Company proposed at a rally that steel is a force for defending peace, and they are determined to produce more and better steel. This steel enterprise once received a batch of orders from the Egyptian people, and the workers said that they must complete the orders quickly and well to support the Egyptian people's struggle. Wu Xuan, a model agricultural laborer in Hebei Province, expressed what can be said to be the wish of the vast number of Chinese farmers, saying that imperialist aggression is absolutely intolerable. We fully support Egypt, and we will do our best to support whatever the Egyptian people need. Many agricultural production cooperatives have stated that they will sell the best grain and cotton to the state, using practical patriotic actions to support our government's statement on the British and French armed invasion of Egypt. He Xiaoyi, the captain of the South China Sea steamship who volunteered to go to the Suez Canal as a pilot not long ago in Guangzhou, once again expressed his wish, saying that he would use concrete actions to support Egypt.

　　Muslims across the country have shown the greatest concern for their Muslim brothers in Egypt. In recent days, many cities have held gatherings of hundreds and thousands of Muslims in succession. In mosques, they have prayed for the just struggle of the Egyptian people and for peace. Some elderly Muslims cannot sleep at night. They say that all Muslims are brothers, and if one hand hurts, the foot is uneasy. We cannot stand idly by. Chinese Muslims must do their best to support Egyptian Muslims and defeat the aggressors.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, November 5th: Today, more than 20,000 people gathered in People's Square in front of the Potala Palace in Lhasa to support Egypt in opposing the armed aggression of British and French imperialism.

　　Early this morning, nearly half of the city's residents, holding various slogans, poured into the venue through the streets. The slogans "British and French imperialists get out of Egypt" and "Resolutely support the sacred struggle of the Egyptian people" shook this ancient city on the plateau.

　　The Dalai Lama sent his deputy scripture teacher, the Chi Jiang Living Buddha, to speak on his behalf at the meeting. He said: "The statement issued by our government in support of Egypt against the armed aggression of British and French imperialism is fully in line with the unanimous wishes of the people of all ethnic groups in China. On behalf of all the monks and lay people in Tibet, I wholeheartedly support this statement." He concluded by saying: We, all the monks and lay people in Tibet, must unite with the people of all ethnic groups in the country to support and help Egypt's just cause, and resolutely oppose the aggressive actions of British and French imperialism.

　　Speaking at the meeting were Sokang Wangqing Gele, Laming Yixi Chuchen, and Bangda Yangpi, members of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. They unanimously angrily condemned the British and French imperialist acts of aggression against Egypt and expressed their heartfelt support for the just struggle of the Egyptian people.

　　Also speaking at the meeting were representatives from the Tibet Patriotic Youth Cultural Association, the Tibet Branch of the Buddhist Association of China, the Preparatory Office of the Tibet Trade Union, and the cultural, educational, and women's circles in Tibet. Their speeches were constantly interrupted by thunderous applause.

　　Today's meeting also solemnly passed a resolution. The resolution stated: "The Tibetan people have tasted the bitterness of imperialism. The evil deeds of the British imperialist invasion of Tibet in 1904 still leave wounds and memories. We vow to stand with the people of the whole country and the peace-loving countries and people of the world to support the sacred struggle of the Egyptian people to defend freedom and independence with practical actions."

　　Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, November 5th: Today, more than 50,000 people of all ethnic groups in Urumqi marched and demonstrated, protesting against the British and French colonialists' aggression against Egypt and supporting the Egyptian people's just struggle.

　　Starting at dawn, angry crowds gathered in People's Square from all directions, and then turned to the city's main streets to hold demonstrations. In the demonstration队伍, there were workers, students, women, children, cadres of institutions and urban residents. They constantly chanted slogans such as "British and French aggressor troops get out of Egypt!" and "Long live the Egyptian people!"

　　Before the demonstration, a rally was held in People's Square. Nusreti, Secretary-General of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, called on everyone at the meeting to resolutely stop the barbaric aggression of the British and French imperialists against Egypt, together with the peace-loving people of the world, until the Egyptian people's just struggle achieves final victory.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, November 5th: More than 50,000 people in Chengdu held a demonstration today to support Egypt against British and French aggression.

　　The marching crowds poured into the People's Stadium from all directions.

　　The meeting was held at the People's Stadium at 3 pm. Nineteen representatives from various democratic parties, people's organizations, and the Han, Hui, Tibetan, and Yi ethnic groups spoke to the masses. Ahong Hu Xuelan, who returned from a visit to Cairo as a member of the Chinese Islamic Hajj delegation, said in his speech that Chengdu Muslims, together with the people of the whole country, resolutely oppose the British and French imperialist aggression against Egypt and will never give up until their goal is achieved.

　　After the meeting, more than 50,000 people held a massive demonstration in the city.

　　Xinhua News Agency, November 5th: Hefei City in Anhui Province and Baotou City in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region held mass rallies today to support the just struggle of the Egyptian people.

　　60,000 people from all walks of life in Anhui Province and Hefei City held a protest rally this afternoon, followed by a demonstration.
