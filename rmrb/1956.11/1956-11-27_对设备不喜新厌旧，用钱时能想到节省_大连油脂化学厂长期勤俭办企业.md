    Not Fickle About Equipment, Thinks About Saving Money When Spending It
    Dalian Grease Chemical Plant Long-Term Diligent and Frugal Enterprise Management
    (Our Dalian dispatch) The Dalian Grease Chemical Plant has long adhered to increasing production and practicing economy. In the past two or three years, it has not only been able to comprehensively complete the state plan every year, but also has been able to comprehensively complete the state plan on a monthly basis, with the exception of individual months.
    The production conditions of this factory are not very good. It is an old factory with nearly forty years of history, and many of the machines and equipment are very old. After careful repair and maintenance by the workers, the equipment is still in good working order, and production is increasing year by year. The planned total output value for this year is more than two and a half times higher than in 1951. At the beginning of this year, when the Chemical Industry Bureau issued this year's state plan, it specifically lowered this year's production plan compared to last year, considering that the factory's equipment was too old. However, the factory did not want to complete the plan easily. After analyzing the favorable factors in production, they took the initiative to ask the higher authorities to increase the production plan by 21.4%. Afterwards, they were not satisfied with this already increased plan target, but strived to break through this target. Therefore, the revised and increased annual total output value plan was completed ahead of schedule on November 17th.
    This factory cherishes the state's funds very much. Although production has been continuously expanded, they have not used state investment for reconstruction and expansion. Their method of increasing production mainly relies on improving operating techniques and making full use of existing equipment. For example, the alkalization kettle is a weak link in soap production, so they tried to raise the height of the four alkalization kettles to increase capacity and improve production. In order to balance the production capacity of each process and the need to add some auxiliary equipment, they also asked the factory's repair workers to manufacture them using old materials. The ten electrolysis tanks in the electrolysis workshop were assembled by workers using old parts. Sometimes they also asked for old equipment that was idle and useless from brother factories, and used it after repair. They implemented the following principle in their practical work: if old ones can be used, new ones will not be made; if savings can be made, they must be made. In the past production increase and economy campaigns, on the one hand, the factory actively explored the potential for increasing production, and at the same time, it also focused on reducing raw material consumption quotas and reducing various expenses. The team economic accounting system promoted by this factory has been very effective, and diligence and thrift have become a common practice among employees. Now all kinds of waste phenomena cannot escape the workers' eyes. If the previous shift of workers has waste phenomena, the next shift of workers will immediately stop them. In last year's production increase and economy campaign, workers in the glycerin section put forward twelve rationalization proposals to eliminate glycerin waste. Even the wooden boxes for packing soap, the workers put a lot of effort into them. They suggested reducing the thickness of the box board by one millimeter, which could save the equivalent of more than 370 cubic meters of logs per year. The factory adopted many measures to save raw materials based on the workers' suggestions. Therefore, serious waste phenomena such as oil leakage have been basically eliminated, so that the crude oil consumption quota has been continuously reduced. In the past, 655 kilograms of crude oil were used to make one ton of soap, but now it has been reduced to only 563 kilograms. In the past, 1,022 kilograms of crude oil were used to make one ton of hardened oil, but now it has been reduced to 1,002 kilograms to 1,006 kilograms. When the crude oil consumption quota was reduced to a relatively reasonable level, they shifted the focus of savings to studying how to use substitute materials. In the past, this factory used some beef tallow or lard to make soap. Because these oils were too expensive, they studied using cheaper peanut oil or soybean oil instead. Later, because peanut oil and soybean oil are also edible oils and have to be exported, and the price is still very expensive, they studied using cottonseed oil and rapeseed oil instead. In the third quarter of this year, they took the initiative to study using rice bran oil, which has a more abundant oil source and lower price, for production. The trial use in the third quarter proved that mixing rice bran oil to make soap can reduce the cost of each ton of soap by more than ten yuan, which can save the country 120,000 yuan a year. This not only saves a large amount of edible oil, but also overcomes the difficulty of insufficient oil source for the factory's future production increase.
    Because this factory has long strived to increase production and practice economy with the spirit of diligence and thrift in running the enterprise, although the quotas for various raw materials and management fees have been continuously reduced, the products it provides to the country and the profits it turns over have been continuously increased. The profit turned over to the state this year is expected to increase by 28% over the annual plan. At the same time, the product cost this year is also expected to decrease by 9.12% compared with the actual cost of last year.

    对设备不喜新厌旧，用钱时能想到节省
    大连油脂化学厂长期勤俭办企业
    本报大连电　大连油脂化学厂长期坚持增产节约，近两三年以来，不但能每年全面完成国家计划，而且除个别月份以外，都能做到按月全面完成国家计划。
    这个工厂的生产条件并不很好。它是一个有将近四十年历史的老厂子，许多机器设备都很旧。这些机器设备经过工人细心的检修、保养，现在使用的情况仍然很好，生产一年比一年提高。今年的生产总值计划比1951年提高两倍半还多。今年初，化工局在下达今年国家计划时，考虑到这个工厂的设备过于陈旧，特地把今年的生产计划比去年降低了一些。但是这个工厂并不想轻易地完成计划，他们分析了生产中的有利因素以后，便主动地要求上级把生产计划提高21.4％。以后，他们并没有满足于这个已经提高了的计划指标，而是努力突破这个指标。因此，这个经过修改提高了的全年总产值计划，在11月17日就提前超额完成了。
    这个工厂很珍惜国家的资金。虽然生产不断扩大，他们并没有拿国家的投资进行改建和扩建。他们增产的办法主要是依靠改进操作技术和充分运用旧有的设备。如碱化釜是生产肥皂的一个薄弱环节，他们就设法把四个碱化釜加高，以增加容量，提高生产。为了平衡各工序的生产能力，需要增添一些辅助设备，他们也叫厂里的修理工人利用旧料制造。电解车间的十台电解槽，就是工人用旧零件装配起来的。有时他们还把兄弟工厂闲置无用的旧设备要来，经修理后加以使用。他们在实际工作中贯彻了这样一条原则：能用旧的就不制新的，能省的就一定要省。这个工厂在历次的增产节约运动中，一方面积极挖掘增产的潜力，也同时抓紧降低原材料消耗定额和减少各项费用的工作。这个工厂推行的班组经济核算制很有成效，勤俭节约已成为职工中的一种风尚。现在各种浪费现象都逃脱不了工人的眼睛。上一班工人有浪费现象，下一班的人马上加以制止。在去年的增产节约运动中，甘油工段的工人就提出了十二项合理化建议来消除甘油的浪费现象。就是装肥皂的木箱，工人也在上边费了不少的心血。他们建议把箱板厚度减少一公厘，一年就可以节约相当于三百七十多立方公尺的原木。工厂根据工人的建议，采取了许多节约原材料的措施。因此现在跑油、漏油等严重浪费现象已基本消除，使原油消耗定额不断降低。过去每做一吨肥皂要用六百五十五公斤原油，现在减少到只用五百六十三公斤。过去每做一吨硬化油要用一千零二十二公斤原油，现在减少到一千零二公斤到一千零六公斤。当原油的消耗定额被降低到比较合理了的时候，他们又把节约的重点转向研究如何运用代用材料。过去这个厂制造肥皂都是用一部分牛油或猪油。因为这些油太贵，他们就研究使用比较便宜的花生油或豆油来代替。以后又因为花生油和豆油也是食用油脂，还要出口，价钱也还是很贵，他们就研究用棉籽油和菜籽油来代替。在今年第三季度，他们又主动研究用一种油源更充足、价格更低廉的米糠油来生产。经第三季度试用证明，掺用米糠油做肥皂，每吨肥皂的成本可降低十多元，一年就可以为国家节约十二万元。这不但节约了大量的食用油脂，而且为这个工厂今后增产克服了油源不足的困难。
    这个工厂由于长期以勤俭办企业的精神努力增产节约，因此虽然各项原材料定额和管理费用不断降低，但是他们为国家提供的产品和上缴的利润却不断增加。今年上缴给国家的利润预计全年比年计划提高28％。同时，今年产品成本预计全年也将比上年实际降低了9.12％。
