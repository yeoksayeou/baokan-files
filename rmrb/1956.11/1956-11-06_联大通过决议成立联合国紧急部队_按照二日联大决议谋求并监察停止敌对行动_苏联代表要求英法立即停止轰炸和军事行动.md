Xinhua News Agency, November 5th, New York: The United Nations General Assembly held another emergency meeting on the evening of November 4th to discuss the issue of British, French, and Israeli aggression against Egypt. The meeting passed the joint proposal of Canada, Colombia, and Norway with a majority vote.

This proposal stipulates:

	1. Establish a United Nations International Emergency Force Command to seek and monitor the cessation of hostilities according to the terms of the United Nations General Assembly resolution of November 2, 1956;

	2. Appoint Major General Burns, Chief of Staff of the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization, as the commander of this command;

	3. Authorize the commander of the command to immediately recruit a limited number of officers from the observer group of the Truce Supervision Organization, and these officers should be nationals of countries other than the permanent members of the Security Council; and further authorize him, in consultation with the Secretary-General, to directly recruit the required officers from various member states other than the permanent members of the Security Council;

	4. Request the Secretary-General to take the administrative measures that may be necessary for the rapid implementation of the actions stipulated in this resolution.

The voting situation was: fifty-seven votes in favor, none against, and nineteen abstentions. The abstaining countries were: Albania, Australia, Bulgaria, Belarus, Czechoslovakia, Egypt, France, Hungary, Israel, Laos, New Zealand, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Turkey, Ukraine, South Africa, the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom.

At the beginning of the meeting, United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskjöld proposed that the United Nations Emergency Force planned to serve in the Middle East, according to the United Nations General Assembly resolution of November 2nd, should be recruited from small countries. Canada, Colombia, and Norway put forward the above proposal to make Hammarskjöld's recommendation effective. New Zealand, Canada, Norway, and Colombia were the first to express their willingness to provide personnel.

Egyptian representative Loutfi condemned Israel's statement requesting the withdrawal of the United Nations Truce Supervision Commission personnel from Gaza and Beersheba. He also condemned Britain and France for refusing to accept the United Nations General Assembly's call for a ceasefire. He said: "Egypt is resisting aggression and will continue this struggle. We firmly believe in our cause because it is the cause of all the people of the world and all peace-loving countries."

British representative Dixon said that Britain and France are studying the resolution of the General Assembly and will submit a reply later.

Pakistani representative Mir Khan announced that Turkey, Iran, Iraq, and Pakistan—the Baghdad Pact countries—will soon meet in Iran to try to stop the war in Egypt. He said that the Prime Minister of Pakistan will also hold talks with the Colombo countries on this issue. He expressed sympathy for the Egyptian people and their ideals for progress and the future, and called for an immediate ceasefire and the complete withdrawal of the invading forces from Egypt.

Indian representative Lal expressed "regret" that Britain and France had not responded to the ceasefire call.

Lal expressed support for the establishment of the United Nations Emergency Force. He believes that this force can "replace the aggressors entering this country (Egypt) and restore peace and the status quo, which can at least be done as a current measure."

Jordanian representative Rifai requested that the resolution passed by the meeting pay "special attention" to the issue of all Israeli forces retreating behind the armistice line.

Soviet representative Sobolev pointed out in his speech that the situation in the Middle East "remains perilous." He condemned Britain and France for continuing their military offensive against Egypt, disregarding the United Nations' order to cease military action.

Sobolev lashed out at the British and French air forces for continuously bombing schools, hospitals, residential buildings, waterworks, radio stations, and other densely populated areas, causing heavy casualties. Sobolev said that Britain and France are brutally eliminating the peaceful residents of Egypt, and the United Nations can no longer ignore this. He suggested that as a first step, the United Nations should demand that Britain and France immediately cease bombing Egyptian territory and cease other military actions. He said that this does not require any supervisory agency, and the whole world will see whether they have complied with this request.

Indonesian representative Soegawono said that Israel's declaration that the Palestine armistice agreement was invalid was malicious, which proves that the parties launching the offensive are determined to disregard the resolution of the General Assembly and use violence to achieve their goals.

Soegawono believes that the plan to establish an international emergency force is helpful. However, he hopes that all parties concerned will see that if the war is stopped quickly, the remaining issues should be resolved through peaceful consultations. In that case, the establishment of such a force would be meaningless.

The Lebanese representative, in his speech, condemned the crimes of Britain, France, and Israel, and lashed out at them for disregarding and betraying international law, the United Nations organization, and the will of the civilized world. He also condemned Israel's unilateral declaration to abolish the Palestine armistice agreement.

The Colombian representative demanded that Israel withdraw its troops to its own country.

Canadian Foreign Minister Pearson said that stopping hostilities is of paramount importance. At the same time, he also said: Compared to a ceasefire, we have a greater collective responsibility, which is a peaceful solution. He called for quick consideration of the American proposal and reiterated that Canada will participate in the United Nations Emergency Force.

US representative Lodge spoke, pointing out that Britain, France, and Israel had not complied with the United Nations ceasefire resolution. He asked the General Assembly to end the debate and immediately vote on the plan to establish an emergency force. He said that the United States is willing to help in terms of airlift, shipping, and supplies.

The British and French representatives opposed ending the debate.

Disregarding the opposition of Britain and France, the General Assembly passed the end of the debate with fifty votes in favor, six against, and sixteen abstentions.

The General Assembly then voted on the proposals of Canada, Norway, and Colombia, and passed the proposals.

    联大通过决议成立联合国紧急部队
    按照二日联大决议谋求并监察停止敌对行动
    苏联代表要求英法立即停止轰炸和军事行动
    新华社5日讯　纽约消息：联合国大会11月4日晚上再次举行紧急会议，讨论英、法、以色列侵略埃及的问题。会议以多数票通过了加拿大、哥伦比亚和挪威三国的联合提案。
    这个提案规定：
    一、设立一个联合国国际紧急部队司令部，根据1956年11月2日联合国大会的决议的条款，谋求并监察敌对行动的停止；
    二、任命联合国停战监察组织参谋长伯恩斯少将为这个司令部的司令；
    三、授权司令部司令立即从停战监察组织的观察员小组招募数目有限的军官，这些军官应该是安全理事会常任理事国以外的国家的国民；并且进一步授权他在同秘书长磋商下，直接从安全理事会常任理事国以外的各个会员国再招募所需要的军官；
    四、请秘书长采取为迅速执行这项决议中规定的行动所可能需要的行政措施。
    投票的情况是：五十七票赞成、没有人反对和十九票弃权。弃权的国家是：阿尔巴尼亚、澳大利亚、保加利亚、白俄罗斯、捷克斯洛伐克、埃及、法国、匈牙利、以色列、老挝、新西兰、波兰、葡萄牙、罗马尼亚、土耳其、乌克兰、南非、苏联和英国。
    在会议开始的时候，联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德提议根据联合国大会11月2日的决议，计划在中东服役的联合国紧急部队应当从各小国中召募。加拿大、哥伦比亚和挪威提出了上述提案，以便使哈马舍尔德的建议生效。新西兰、加拿大、挪威和哥伦比亚并且首先表示愿意提供人员。
    埃及代表卢特菲谴责以色列要求联合国停战监察委员会人员撤出加沙和比尔希巴的声明。他还谴责英法两国拒不接受联合国大会关于停火的呼吁。他说：“埃及正在抵抗侵略，并且将继续进行这个斗争。我们坚信我们的事业，因为这是全世界所有的人民和所有爱好和平的国家的事业。”
    英国代表狄克逊说，英国和法国正在研究大会的决议，并且将在晚些时候提出答复。
    巴基斯坦代表米尔汗宣布，土耳其、伊朗、伊拉克和巴基斯坦——巴格达条约国家——不久即将在伊朗开会来设法制止埃及的战事。他说，巴基斯坦总理也将同科伦坡国家就这个问题进行会谈。他表示同情埃及人民和他们对进步和未来的理想，并且要求立即停火，要求侵略军全部从埃及撤退。
    印度代表拉尔对英法两国没有答复停火呼吁表示“遗憾”。
    拉尔表示赞成建立联合国紧急部队。他认为，这支部队可以“替代进入这个国家（埃及）的侵略者，而且将恢复和平和现状，这是至少可以作为一个当前的措施来做到的”。
    约旦代表里法伊要求会议通过的决议“特别注意”所有以色列部队退到停战线后面去的问题。
    苏联代表索波列夫发言指出，中东的局势“仍然是险恶的”，他谴责英国和法国不顾联合国的停止军事行动的命令，而继续对埃及实行军事进攻。
    索波列夫痛斥英法两国的空军不停地轰炸人烟稠密地区的学校、医院、住宅、自来水厂和广播电台等，这种轰炸造成了重大的伤亡。索波列夫说，英、法两国正在残暴地消灭埃及的和平居民，联合国不能再置之不理。他建议，作为第一步联合国应当要求英、法两国立即停止轰炸埃及领土和停止其他军事行动。他说，这是用不着什么监督机构的，全世界都会看到它们有没有遵从这个要求。
    印度尼西亚代表苏加沃说，以色列宣布巴勒斯坦停战协定无效是用心险恶的，这一点证明了发动进攻的各方决心无视大会的决议，而要用暴力达到他们的目的。
    苏加沃认为，成立国际紧急部队的计划是有帮助的。但是，他希望有关各方看到，如果战争很快停止了，遗留下来的问题就应当通过和平协商来解决，这样，成立这种部队就是没有意义的了。
    黎巴嫩代表在发言中谴责英、法、以三国的罪行，痛斥它们无视和背弃国际法律、联合国组织和文明世界的意志。他还谴责以色列片面宣布废除巴勒斯坦停战协定。
    哥伦比亚代表要求以色列把军队撤回本国。
    加拿大外交部长皮尔逊说，停止敌对行动具有首要的重要性。同时，他又说：同停火相比，我们有更大的集体责任，那就是和平解决。他要求迅速考虑美国的提案，并且重申加拿大将参加联合国紧急部队。
    美国代表洛奇发言提出英、法、以三国没有遵守联合国的停火决议。他要求大会结束辩论，立即就成立紧急部队的计划进行表决。他表示，美国愿意在空运、航运和供应方面进行帮助。
    英国和法国代表反对结束辩论。
    大会不顾英、法两国反对，以五十票赞成，六票反对、十六票弃权通过结束辩论。
    大会接着对加拿大、挪威和哥伦比亚的提案进行表决，并且通过了这个提案。
