	The Boasting King

	Throughout history, all aggressors have enjoyed publishing fabricated communiqués about "glorious victories" to encourage their cannon fodder. Today, Britain and France are no exception.

	Forty-eight hours after Britain and France launched their war of aggression, the French Ministry of Defense gleefully announced: "The Egyptian air force has almost lost its combat effectiveness," "British and French air forces have carried out many air raids," and "The task of destroying the Egyptian air force has been completed." Four days later, the French Ministry of Defense described it even more vividly: "It is reported that 95% of the Egyptian air force has been destroyed." The dizzy French Ministry of Defense boasted: "The air force is particularly a real danger." In fact, just a few hours before this spokesman announced the "victory," the heroic Egyptian air force raided the Gamal Airport in Port Said, and British news agencies reported that "the MiG aircraft attack was serious."

	Was the Egyptian air force really destroyed? President Nasser now publicly replied: The aggressors' statement "is just a dream!" He said that the Egyptian air force consciously refrained from taking action, and the aircraft destroyed on the ground were all "wooden dummy aircraft."

	The aggressors' boasting has been exposed. Now let's see how these boasting kings will cover up their shame. (Chao)

    吹牛大王
    历史上的所有侵略者总是喜欢发表捏造的关于“辉煌战果”的公报，来给自己的炮灰们打气。今天英、法也不例外。
    在英、法发动侵略战争四十八小时以后，法国国防部就兴高采烈地宣布：“埃及的空军差不多已失去战斗力了”，“英法空军各自进行了很多次空袭”，“摧毁埃及空军的任务已经完成”。四天以后，法国国防部说得更是活灵活现了，“据报有95％的埃及空军已被摧毁”。冲昏了头脑的法国国防部又夸耀说：“空军特别是一种真正的危险”。其实就在这位发言人宣布“战果”前几个小时，英勇的埃及空军还突击了塞得港的加马尔机场，英国的通讯社的消息说，“米格式飞机的袭击是严重的”。
    埃及空军真的被摧毁了吗？纳赛尔总统现在公开答复道：侵略者的这种说法“只是梦想”！他说，埃及空军是有意识的不采取行动，地面上被击毁的飞机都是“木头做的假飞机”。
    侵略者的牛吹破了。现在看这些吹牛大王怎样给自己遮羞吧。　（超）
