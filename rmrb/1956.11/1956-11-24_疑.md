    Doubt

    Gu Jiaxi

    "To believe everything in books is worse than having no books at all." Although this saying is somewhat extreme, it does contain a grain of truth. In modern terms, it means reading with a critical eye, thinking independently, and not assuming that everything in a book is correct. If something seems doubtful, one should dare to question it; otherwise, one will inevitably be fooled, which is worse than not reading at all.

    In fact, this principle can be applied to most things in general.

    This brings up the issue of "doubt."

    "Excessive doubt" is naturally undesirable, as it leads to distrust of everything and constant "suspicion." Applying this attitude to dealing with people and things will only be detrimental.

    We should doubt things that are doubtful until we have a clear understanding of them. This is probably what is commonly referred to as "doubt before deciding!"

    People often have the experience of having doubts about something, feeling that there might be a problem. However, upon further consideration, passive thoughts such as "Perhaps it's not wrong!" or "Why be so 'doubtful'?" often allow it to slip away. Later, however, facts prove that there was indeed a problem, and one should have been "more doubtful" and "pursued it further" at the time. People have learned this lesson more than once, but most still fail to remember it well.

    For example, after watching the film "The Life of Wu Xun," one felt something was wrong, but it was just a fleeting thought and one did not doubt it further. It was known that members of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique had counter-revolutionary historical problems and connections with Kuomintang military police and secret agents, but this was not doubted further or pursued. If we had doubted these things earlier, wouldn't the losses have been much smaller?

    "Doubting a bit," "thinking a bit," and "pondering" – there seems to be no harm in approaching things with this attitude. Problems are often discovered through such "doubt," "thinking," and "pondering." Blind faith due to personality cults, bookishness, and dogmatism, taking a "deeply convinced" and "unquestioning" attitude toward everything, and accepting everything wholesale, is an undesirable status quo.

    People who are good at doubting and asking questions are often more enterprising. They are generally "dissatisfied with the status quo" and "unwilling to settle for mediocrity." Generally speaking, creative people are mostly "good at doubting," so it can be said: "Everything starts with doubt."

    疑
    顾家熙
    “尽信书，不如无书”这话虽不免失之于偏激，但，其中确包含有正确的东西。用现代语来说，就是要用批判的态度来读书，读书时要独立思考，不要认为书中的话全是对的；应该怀疑的地方就要大胆地怀疑，否则难免是要上当的，那就不如不读书了。
    其实这个道理，用到一般事物上去也还是可以适用的。
    这里牵涉到一个“疑”字的问题。
    “多疑”自然不好，这会变成对任何事物都不相信，一天到晚老是“疑神疑鬼”，这种态度如用来待人接物，只有坏处，不会有什么好处。
    我们要对可疑的事物，则疑之。必须弄得一清二楚才可罢手。这大概就是平常所谓“疑而后决”吧！
    人们也常常有这样的经验，对某一事物曾有些怀疑，心动了一下，仿佛觉得其中有些什么问题。但，再一考虑，往往在“也许不会错吧！”“何必‘多疑’呢！”等等的消极的念头之下，就轻轻地让它滑了过去。然而，后来事实证明了，的确是一个问题，当时应该“多怀疑一下”“追下去”。人们接受这种教训已经不是一回，但多数的人还是未能好好记取。
    例如看了“武训传”这个电影，觉得不对头，但只一闪而过，没有疑下去；本来知道胡风反革命集团分子有反革命历史问题，和国民党军警宪特有往来，也没有疑下去，追下去。如能早疑，则损失不是小得多了吗？
    “怀疑一下”、“想一想”、“推敲推敲”，用这样的态度来对待事物，似乎是无什么坏处可言的。问题也往往是在这种“疑”、“想”、“推敲”之下，得以发现出来。由于个人崇拜，书呆子习气和教条主义，对于一切事物都采取“深信不疑”“毋庸怀疑”，而采取全盘接受下来的态度，是不足取的现状维持派。
    善疑好问的人多富于进取心，他们大抵“不满于现状”，“不安于中等水平”。一般地说，有创造性的人，大都是“善疑”的，所以可以说：“一切从疑起”。
