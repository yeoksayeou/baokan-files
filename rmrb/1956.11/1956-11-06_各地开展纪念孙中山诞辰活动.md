Xinhua News Agency report: As the 90th anniversary of the birth of the great democrat revolutionary Sun Yat-sen approached, memorial activities were successively launched in various places. On November 1st, more than sixty elderly people who had followed Mr. Sun Yat-sen for many years in the past, or who had met him many times, gathered at the Beijing Research Institute of Culture and History to commemorate Mr. Sun Yat-sen in a forum. The old scholar Luo Jieqiu also brought the "Draft General Regulations of the Chinese Revolutionary Alliance" which he had collected for many years, and Mr. Sun's portrait which he received when he attended the memorial service thirty-one years ago at the time of Mr. Sun's death.
　　In Nanjing, where Mr. Sun Yat-sen's mausoleum is located, the preparatory committee for the 90th anniversary of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's birth, established by Jiangsu Province and Nanjing City, has invited relevant departments to a meeting to decide to hold lectures, reports, and forums in the army, government offices, factories, and schools in Nanjing to widely publicize Mr. Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary deeds, and will visit Sun Yat-sen's Mausoleum on November 11th and 12th. In order to restore the former residence of Mr. Sun Yat-sen when he took office as the Provisional President to its original appearance, the preparatory committee specially invited Jiang Shichang, the adjutant who served Mr. Sun Yat-sen when he took office as President, Tang Bin, the chief of the Architectural Section of the Presidential Palace at that time, and Fu Xuanqing, who participated in the preparation of the presidential inauguration ceremony, to recall the furnishings of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's residence at that time and provide specific guidance for the arrangement, for people from all walks of life to admire. More than twenty old members of the Tongmenghui and social elders who are familiar with the life and deeds of Mr. Sun Yat-sen have written commemorative poems and articles.
　　In Tianjin, a symposium was held by the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang. More than forty old members of the Tongmenghui and people from all walks of life who were familiar with Mr. Sun Yat-sen introduced Mr. Sun Yat-sen's great revolutionary spirit from various aspects at the meeting. Hu Ruyi, who once served as a counselor in Mr. Sun Yat-sen's Grand Marshal's Office, said that Mr. Sun Yat-sen was a revolutionary with ideas and foresight. Because he pursued the truth and dared to accept new ideas, he proposed the idea of learning from Russia and cooperating with the Communist Party. Old members of the Tongmenghui, Wu Songping and Yang Shengwu, also brought out the photos presented by Mr. Sun Yat-sen and the letters signed by Mr. Sun Yat-sen himself, which they had preserved for thirty to forty years, and prepared to lend them to the exhibition commemorating the 90th anniversary of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's birth.
　　Chen Jingxiu, who used to be a counselor in the Grand Marshal's Office, Liu Yaxiu, the deputy counselor, Wang Jingxin, the secretary of the Grand Marshal's Office, and Wang Ziqian, an old member of the Tongmenghui in 1906, and other old friends of Mr. Sun Yat-sen also recalled how Mr. Sun Yat-sen accommodated different opinions and how he patiently guided and educated cadres and his tireless spirit of learning at the symposium held by the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. They unanimously believed that we should learn from Mr. Sun Yat-sen's excellent qualities and oppose arrogance and complacency.
　　In Yunnan Province, far away in the southwestern border of the motherland, a preparatory committee for the 90th anniversary of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's birth has also been established, with Yu Yichuan, Vice Chairman of the Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and Secretary of the Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, serving as the director. Memorial activities have begun, and a grand memorial meeting will be held on November 12th.

    各地开展纪念孙中山诞辰活动
    据新华社讯　伟大的民主主义革命家孙中山先生诞辰九十周年到来以前，各地陆续开展了纪念孙中山先生诞辰的活动。11月1日六十多位过去曾经追随过中山先生多年或者是曾多次会见过先生的老人，在北京文史研究馆集会座谈纪念孙中山先生。老学者罗介丘还拿来了自己收藏多年的“中国同盟会总章草案”和三十一年前中山先生逝世时参加凭吊得到的先生遗像。
    在孙中山先生陵墓所在地的南京市，江苏省及南京市成立的纪念孙中山先生诞辰九十周年筹备委员会，已邀请各有关部门开会，决定在南京的部队、机关、工厂、学校中举行讲演会、报告会和座谈会，广泛宣传中山先生的革命事迹，并将在11月11日和12日两天参谒中山陵。为了使中山先生就任临时大总统时的住处恢复旧观，筹委会特别邀请了孙中山先生就任大总统时的随从副官江世昌、当时任总统府建筑科长的唐斌和参加筹备总统就职典礼的傅选青三位耆老，回忆当时中山先生住处的陈设情况，具体指导布置，以供各界瞻仰。熟悉孙中山先生生平事迹的老同盟会员及社会耆老们，已有二十多位写了纪念诗文。
    天津市由中国国民党革命委员会天津市委员会主持召开了座谈会，四十多个老同盟会员和熟悉孙中山先生情况的社会人士，在会上从各个方面介绍了孙中山先生的伟大革命精神。曾在孙中山先生大元帅府任参议的胡汝翼说，孙中山先生是一位有主张、有远见的革命家。由于他追求真理，敢于接受新思想，他才提出以俄为师、同共产党合作的主张。老同盟会会员吴颂平、杨生吾还拿出了他们保存了三四十年的孙中山先生赠送的照片和孙中山先生亲笔署名的信，准备借给孙中山先生诞辰九十周年纪念展览会展出。
    过去曾任大元帅府参议的陈敬修、副参议刘亚休，大元帅府秘书王敬信，1906年的老同盟会会员王子骞等孙中山先生的故旧，也在中国人民政治协商会议四川省委员会召开的座谈会上，回忆了孙中山先生如何容纳不同的意见，怎样循循善诱教育干部等优良作风和孜孜不倦的好学精神。他们一致认为应该学习孙中山先生的这些优良品质，反对骄傲自满情绪。
    远处祖国西南边陲的云南省，也已成立了纪念孙中山先生诞辰九十周年的筹备委员会，由中国人民政治协商会议云南省委员会副主席、中共云南省委员会书记于一川担任主任。纪念活动已开始进行，11月12日将隆重举行纪念大会。
