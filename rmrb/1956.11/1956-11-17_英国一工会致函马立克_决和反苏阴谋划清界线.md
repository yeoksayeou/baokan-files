    Xinhua News Agency, London, November 14th (TASS dispatch): The Greenwich Trades Council in Britain recently wrote to the Soviet Ambassador to Britain, Malik, stating that under no circumstances would the Greenwich trade union organization support the establishment in Hungary of a system that goes against the interests of the Hungarian people, especially the interests of the working people. The letter pointed out that people who are hostile to world peace and the interests of all working people have attempted to exploit the internal difficulties of the Hungarian People's Republic to establish a government in Hungary that goes against the interests of the working people and all the people, which "would not only be dangerous to the Soviet Union, but would also threaten world peace." The letter stated that the Greenwich trade union organization wants to "draw a line against those who incite anti-Soviet sentiment, because such sentiment is a very serious threat to world peace."

    英国一工会致函马立克
    决和反苏阴谋划清界线
    据新华社16日讯　据塔斯社伦敦14日讯：英国格林威治工会理事会最近写信给苏联驻英国大使马立克，表示不论在任何情况下，格林威治的工会组织都不会支持在匈牙利建立一种违背匈牙利人民利益、特别是违背劳动人民利益的制度。信中指出，敌视世界和平和全体劳动人民的利益的人曾经企图利用匈牙利人民共和国内部的困难，在匈牙利建立一个违背劳动人民和全体人民利益的政府，这“不仅会对苏联产生危险，而且也威胁到世界和平”。信中表示格林威治的工会组织要“同那些鼓动反苏情绪的人划清界线，因为这种情绪是对世界和平的十分严重的威胁”。
