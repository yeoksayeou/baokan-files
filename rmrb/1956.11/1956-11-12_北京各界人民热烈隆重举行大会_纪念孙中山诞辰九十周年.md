Xinhua News Agency, November 11th: Sun Yat-sen, the national hero of China's modern democratic revolution and the great revolutionary forerunner, is respected by all Chinese people. Today, on the eve of the 90th anniversary of his birth, people from all walks of life in Beijing solemnly held a commemorative meeting.

    The commemorative meeting was held in the auditorium of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.

    National leaders Mao Zedong, Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai and others attended the meeting.

    More than 40 overseas Chinese and Hong Kong and Macao compatriots traveled a long distance to Beijing to participate in the commemoration.

    Because Dr. Sun Yat-sen's democratic revolutionary ideas have influenced many countries in the world, especially Asian and African countries, he is respected by the people of these countries. Today, more than 160 guests from more than 30 countries attended the commemorative meeting.

    The atmosphere in the venue was solemn. In the center of the curtain on the rostrum was a portrait of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, with green lettering on both sides of the portrait: "1866-1956." In front of the portrait were densely placed colorful flowers.

    Our national leaders, members of the presidium of the meeting, and guests from various countries stepped onto the rostrum, and the audience stood up and warmly applauded to welcome them.

    More than 1,600 people attended today's commemorative meeting.

    At 2:15 p.m., Zhou Enlai, Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and Premier of the State Council, announced the opening of the commemorative meeting for the 90th anniversary of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's birth.

    The entire audience stood up and sang the national anthem.

    Zhou Enlai delivered the opening speech, saying that today, we commemorate the outstanding pioneer of China's modern democratic revolution, Dr. Sun Yat-sen, with respect and remembrance. He said: "Today, as we commemorate the 90th anniversary of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's birth, we see that China has undergone tremendous and fundamental changes. Dr. Sun Yat-sen's ideals and the unfinished Chinese democratic revolution that he initiated have been inherited and realized by the Chinese working class and its political party - the Chinese Communist Party."

    Zhou Enlai said: "China's territory of Taiwan is still under American aggression. All patriots, all loyal believers of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, should work together to achieve the peaceful liberation of Taiwan."

    Zhou Enlai then said: "The 600 million Chinese people who have finally achieved revolutionary victory after a long period of arduous struggle, extend their warm support to the great Egyptian people who are bravely resisting aggression on both sides of the Suez Canal, and extend their warm support to all countries and people in Asia and Africa and the world who are engaged in the heroic struggle against colonialism, as we commemorate the 90th anniversary of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's birth today."

    In his opening speech, Zhou Enlai specially pointed out the great significance of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's letter to the Soviet Union when he passed away. He said: "In the seven years since the victory of the Chinese revolution, the militant friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people has become even deeper. Any conspiracy by imperialism to sow discord between China and the Soviet Union is a futile fantasy."

    Zhou Enlai expressed his gratitude to the international friends who had helped Dr. Sun Yat-sen for the Chinese revolution, and expressed his condolences to the families of the international friends who sacrificed their blood for the Chinese revolution.

    Finally, Zhou Enlai said: "Dr. Sun Yat-sen's great contribution to the Chinese people will be immortal in Chinese history." He suggested that everyone stand up and pay tribute to the great Dr. Sun Yat-sen.

    Then, the entire audience stood in silence to express their respect to Dr. Sun Yat-sen.

    Lin Boqu, member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, then spoke at the meeting. Lin Boqu pointed out that "Dr. Sun Yat-sen was the first national hero in Chinese history to call for revolution with a democratic program." He said that during the forty years that Mr. Sun Yat-sen devoted himself to the revolution, he continuously progressed with the progress of the times, and finally progressed from a revolutionary democrat to a good friend of the Chinese Communist Party, and became an ally of the most progressive class in Chinese history—the proletariat—in the revolution.

    Lin Boqu said: "Mr. Sun Yat-sen unconditionally stood with the broad masses of the people, resolutely opposed the imperialist forces regardless of all pressure and temptation, and constantly struggled to win national independence and democratic freedom. This is the fundamental reason why he became an immortal national hero. We should actively promote Mr. Sun Yat-sen's patriotic thought and revolutionary spirit, and regard it as our nation's precious heritage."

    Lin Boqu said: "The Chinese people are fighting to build their own country and to strive for world peace; no matter when, if the aggressors dare to offend us and dare to destroy world peace, the Chinese people must unite with the peace-loving people of the world to give them a head-on blow."

    Lin Boqu called on all patriots in the country to work together to build a great motherland and to work together to defend world peace.

    Li Jishen, Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, and He Xiangning, Vice Chairman, spoke at the meeting successively.

    Li Jishen, Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, reviewed Dr. Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary struggle in his speech. He said that in the thirty years since Sun Yat-sen's death, the Chinese Communist Party has led the Chinese people to completely complete the new democratic revolution and has achieved a decisive victory in the socialist revolution. Today, our people enjoy the fullest democratic freedom, our society has basically eliminated the phenomenon of people exploiting people, and all ethnic groups are completely equal in politics, economy, and culture; the democratic parties will "coexist for a long time and supervise each other" with the Communist Party, and the good working relationship between the parties over the years has created an excellent example of multi-party cooperation under the socialist system.

    Li Jishen finally called on all those who followed Dr. Sun Yat-sen to inherit Dr. Sun Yat-sen's glorious revolutionary tradition, promote Dr. Sun Yat-sen's spirit of continuous progress, and contribute all their talents and strength to building socialism, opposing imperialist aggression, and defending world peace.

    He Xiangning, Vice Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, narrated Dr. Sun Yat-sen's life deeds with a feeling of remembrance. This close comrade-in-arms of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, who is eighty years old, finally said excitedly at the meeting: "I not only use my own eyes to see all of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's ideals realized, but I also firmly believe that I will see socialism fully realized in China. Moreover, my vitality demands to see communism fully realized in China."

    After He Xiangning finished speaking, Shao Lizi, on behalf of the presidium of the meeting, read out the congratulatory telegrams and letters from Indonesian President Sukarno, Syrian President Kuwatly, Pakistani President Mirza, Indian Prime Minister Nehru, Burmese Prime Minister U Ba Swe, Burmese Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League Chairman U Nu, Indonesian Prime Minister Sastroamidjojo, Pakistani Prime Minister Suhrawardy, Ceylon Prime Minister Bandaranaike, Cambodian Prince Sihanouk, and Nepalese Prime Minister Acharya.

    Shao Lizi also announced that the meeting had received congratulatory telegrams from social organizations and well-known social figures from thirteen countries: the Soviet Union, Nepal, India, Japan, Pakistan, Belgium, the United Kingdom, Italy, Denmark, Spain, Iceland, the United States, and Argentina.

    The meeting continued after a ten-minute break. Zhou Enlai, Chairman of the meeting, announced: The Soviet delegation invited to our country to participate in the 90th anniversary of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's birth has just arrived in Beijing and they are now here to participate in the commemorative meeting. The head of the Soviet delegation is Moskatov, Chairman of the Inspection Committee of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and Cherepanov in the delegation was the chief advisor of the Huangpu Military Academy founded by Dr. Sun Yat-sen thirty years ago.

    The audience applauded warmly to welcome the arrival of the Soviet representatives.

    Then, the chairman of the meeting invited thirteen foreign guests to speak at the meeting successively. They were: Moskatov, head of the Soviet delegation and Chairman of the Inspection Committee of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Xin Bo, Chairman of the Burma-China Friendship Association, Wen Youzhang, Chairman of the Canadian Peace Congress, R.K. Nehru, Indian Ambassador to China, Fal, Egyptian Commercial Representative to China, Mrs. Rasuna Said, Vice Chairman of the Indonesia-China Friendship Association, Matsumoto Jiichiro, Chairman of the Japan-China Friendship Association, Bai Nanyun, head of the Korean delegation and President of the Korean Academy of Sciences, Averzid, head of the Mongolian delegation, Deputy Chairman of the Mongolian Council of Ministers, and member of the Central Committee of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, Bashir Ahmed, head of the Pakistani Science Delegation, Ali Buzo, head of the Syrian parliamentarian delegation to China and Secretary-General of the Syrian People's Party, Charles Candler (the third son of Candler, who rescued Dr. Sun Yat-sen when he was in distress in London in 1896), and Phan Bi Bich, representative of the Vietnam Fatherland Front.

    When Bai Nanyun finished his speech, he presented a red flag to the meeting. When Averzid finished his speech, he presented an oil painting of Dr. Sun Yat-sen to the meeting. Zhou Enlai accepted these two souvenirs on behalf of the presidium of the meeting.

    At the end of the meeting, Shao Lizi, on behalf of the presidium of the meeting, announced that the meeting had received two congratulatory telegrams from the Soviet representative to Japan, Tikhvinsky, and Su Benmoto from Osaka, Japan.

    北京各界人民热烈隆重举行大会
    纪念孙中山诞辰九十周年
    新华社11日讯　中国近代民主革命的民族英雄、伟大的革命先行者孙中山先生，受到了全中国人民的尊敬。今天，在他的诞辰九十周年前夕，北京各界人民隆重举行纪念大会。
    纪念大会在中国人民政协礼堂举行。
    国家的领导人毛泽东、刘少奇、周恩来等参加了大会。
    有四十多位海外华侨和港澳同胞远程来北京参加纪念。
    由于孙中山先生的民主革命思想在世界许多国家特别是亚非国家发生了影响，他受到这些国家人民的尊敬。今天有三十多个国家的一百六十多位来宾参加了纪念大会。
    会场上充满着庄严的气氛。在主席台正中的布幕上悬挂着孙中山先生的画像，画像两边挂着绿色字标：“1866—1956 ”。在画像前面密密地放置着各色鲜花。
    我国国家领导人和大会主席团成员以及各国来宾登上主席台，全场起立热烈鼓掌欢迎他们。
    出席今天纪念大会的有一千六百多人。
    下午二时十五分，中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会主席、国务院总理周恩来宣布孙中山先生诞辰九十周年纪念大会开始。
    全体起立，奏国歌。
    周恩来致开会词说，今天，我们以崇敬和怀念的心情，来纪念我国近代民主革命的卓越先驱孙中山先生。他说：“今天，当我们纪念孙中山先生诞生九十周年的时候，我们看到中国已经发生了巨大的和根本的变化。孙中山先生的理想和由他揭开了序幕而未完成的中国民主主义革命事业，已由中国工人阶级和它的政党——中国共产党所继承和实现。”
    周恩来说：“中国的领土台湾还受着美国的侵略。一切爱国者，一切孙中山先生的忠实信徒，应当共同努力，实现台湾的和平解放。”
    周恩来接着说：“经过长期艰苦奋斗而终于取得革命胜利的六万万中国人民，在今天纪念孙中山先生诞生九十周年的时候，向着苏伊士运河两岸进行着英勇抗战的伟大的埃及人民伸出热烈支援的手，向着亚非两大洲和全世界所有反殖民主义的英勇斗争的国家和人民伸出热烈支援的手。”
    周恩来在开会词中特别指出孙中山先生在逝世时所留下的致苏联遗书的伟大意义，他说：“中国革命胜利后的七年以来，中国人民和苏联人民的战斗的友谊更加深厚了。帝国主义企图挑拨中苏友谊的任何阴谋，都是徒劳的幻想。”
    周恩来表示感谢那些为了中国革命曾经援助过孙中山先生的国际朋友们，并且向为中国革命牺牲流血的国际朋友们的遗族表示慰问。
    最后周恩来说：“孙中山先生对中国人民的伟大贡献，在中国的历史上是永垂不朽的。”他建议大家起立，向伟大的孙中山先生致敬。
    接着，全场肃立，向孙中山先生表示敬意。
    大会接着由中共中央政治局委员林伯渠讲话。林伯渠指出，“孙中山先生是中国历史上第一个用民主主义纲领来号召革命的民族英雄”。他说，中山先生在他一生致力革命的四十年间，不断地因时代的进步而进步，终于从一个革命的民主主义者进一步成为中国共产党的好朋友，成为中国历史上最进步的阶级——无产阶级在革命中的同盟者。
    林伯渠说：“中山先生无条件地同广大人民站在一起，不顾一切压力和诱惑而同帝国主义势力坚决对立，始终不懈地为争取民族独立和民主自由而斗争，这就是他所以成为不朽的民族英雄的根本所在。我们应当积极发扬中山先生的这种爱国思想和革命精神，把它当作我们民族的珍贵遗产。”
    林伯渠说：“中国人民为建设自己的国家，为争取世界和平而斗争；不管是在什么时候，侵略者如果敢于触犯我们，敢于破坏世界和平，中国人民一定要同全世界爱好和平的人民一致给以迎头痛击。”
    林伯渠号召全国一切爱国者为建设伟大祖国而共同努力，为保卫世界和平而共同努力。
    中国国民党革命委员会主席李济深、副主席何香凝先后在会上讲话。
    中国国民党革命委员会主席李济深在会上追述了孙中山先生革命奋斗的一生。他说，在孙中山逝世以后的三十年间，中国共产党领导中国人民彻底完成了新民主主义革命，并且取得了社会主义革命的决定性的胜利。今天，我国人民享受着最充分的民主自由，我们的社会已经基本上消灭了人剥削人的现象，各个民族在政治经济文化各方面是完全平等的；各民主党派将与共产党“长期共存、互相监督”，而各党派多年来良好的共事关系，已经为社会主义制度下的多党合作创造了优良的范例。
    李济深最后号召所有追随过孙中山先生的人继承孙中山先生的光荣革命传统，发扬孙中山先生不断进步的精神，为建设社会主义、为反对帝国主义侵略和保卫世界和平，贡献出自己的一切才智和力量。
    中国国民党革命委员会副主席何香凝怀着怀念的心情叙述了孙中山先生的生平事迹。这位八十高龄的孙中山先生生前的亲密战友最后在会上兴奋地说：“我不但用自己的眼睛看到孙中山先生的理想全部得到实现，我也坚信我也会看到社会主义在中国得到全部实现。并且，我的生命力，要求看到共产主义在中国得到全部的实现。”
    何香凝讲话结束以后，邵力子代表大会主席团宣读了印度尼西亚总统苏加诺、叙利亚总统库阿特利、巴基斯坦总统米尔扎、印度总理尼赫鲁、缅甸总理吴巴瑞、缅甸反法西斯人民自由同盟主席吴努、印度尼西亚总理沙斯特罗阿米佐约、巴基斯坦总理苏拉瓦底、锡兰总理班达拉奈克、柬埔寨西哈努克亲王、尼泊尔首相阿查里雅的贺电和贺信。
    邵力子还宣布大会收到了苏联、尼泊尔、印度、日本、巴基斯坦、比利时、英国、意大利、丹麦、西班牙、冰岛、美国、阿根廷十三个国家的社会团体和著名社会人士的贺电。
    大会在休息十分钟后继续开会。大会主席周恩来宣布：应邀来我国参加孙中山先生诞辰九十周年纪念的苏联代表团刚才赶到北京，他们现在来参加纪念大会。苏联代表团团长是苏联共产党中央检查委员会主席莫斯卡托夫，代表团中的契列班诺夫是三十年前孙中山先生所创办的黄埔军校总顾问。
    全场热烈鼓掌欢迎苏联代表的到来。
    接着，大会主席请十三个外国来宾先后在大会上讲话。他们是：苏联代表团团长、苏共中央检查委员会主席莫斯卡托夫，缅甸中国友好协会主席信波，加拿大和平大会主席文幼章，印度驻中国大使拉·库·尼赫鲁，埃及驻中国商务代表法尔，印度尼西亚中国友好协会副主席拉苏娜·赛依德夫人，日本中国友好协会会长松本治一郎，朝鲜代表团团长、朝鲜科学院院长白南云，蒙古代表团团长、蒙古部长会议副主席、蒙古人民革命党中央委员阿维尔齐德，巴基斯坦科学代表团团长巴希尔·艾哈迈德，叙利亚议员访华团团长、叙利亚人民党总书记阿里·布佐，英国机械工程师堪勒斯·康德黎（1896年孙中山先生在伦敦蒙难时，曾经援救过中山先生的康德黎先生的第三个儿子），越南祖国战线代表潘必遵。
