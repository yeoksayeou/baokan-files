Xinhua News Agency, November 23rd: The National Congress of Basic-Level Trade Union Cadres of Joint State-Private Enterprises opened in Beijing this morning.

Attending this conference were 1,015 trade union workers from joint state-private enterprises in various provinces, cities, and autonomous regions across the country. A small number of Party committee secretaries and public representatives from joint state-private enterprises also participated in the congress.

The main tasks of the conference are to systematically study and determine the guiding principles and tasks of trade union work after the overall joint state-private ownership of industries, and to summarize and exchange experiences in trade union work in joint state-private enterprises over the past year.

Lai Ruoyu, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, delivered a report to the conference entitled "The Current Tasks of Trade Union Organizations in Joint State-Private Enterprises." He said that after the overall joint state-private ownership of industries, the ownership of enterprises has fundamentally changed. With the exception of receiving fixed interest, capitalists have no control over the enterprise which is now completely managed by the state. The future task of trade union organizations is to continue to unite and educate capitalists, gradually transforming them into laborers who support themselves; to transform joint enterprises into completely socialist enterprises in a planned and step-by-step manner, in accordance with the principles of socialist management, thereby promoting the development of social productive forces.

Lai Ruoyu then elaborated on five issues: production management in joint state-private enterprises, uniting and educating capitalists and transforming them, democratization of enterprise management, appropriately resolving the material welfare of the working masses, and trade union construction. When discussing the issue of production management in enterprises, Lai Ruoyu pointed out that trade union organizations should recognize that the joint ownership of enterprises has created favorable conditions for the development of production that did not exist in the past. They should make full use of these favorable conditions and actively organize the masses to carry out socialist emulation and advanced producer movements, so as to better promote the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses. He said that trade union organizations should also actively organize and mobilize workers and management personnel to jointly study various methods of improving enterprise management, and overcome some of the current chaotic phenomena in the operation and management of joint enterprises.

When discussing the issue of uniting, educating, and transforming capitalists, Lai Ruoyu analyzed the changes that have taken place among capitalists before and after the joint state-private ownership of enterprises. He said that in order to help capitalists carry out self-reform, trade union organizations should strengthen their work with capitalists. Trade unions should strive to get more capitalists to participate in socialist emulation, so that they can be transformed through labor practice. Their correct opinions on work should be supported in the same way as those of workers; when they make contributions, they should be commended and rewarded equally. They and their families can be absorbed into various social activities organized by the trade union; they can be invited to attend certain trade union meetings as non-voting members so that they can be in closer contact with the working masses and be influenced by the spirit of the working class. Our aim in providing such care is to promote the capitalists' self-reform more quickly. He said that although the bourgeoisie generally accepts transformation and tends towards progress, there are also a small number of people who have some erroneous thoughts and behaviors. For example, some are passive and loaf on the job, and irresponsible; some are extravagant and wasteful of enterprise property, and a few are even corrupt, stealing and embezzling for personal gain; some are arrogant after having positions and power, using excuses to attack past activists of the trade union; some are dissatisfied and quite hostile to socialist transformation. Appropriate criticism and struggle should be carried out against these erroneous thoughts and behaviors, with the aim of uniting and transforming. In the past, various localities have had concrete experience in this regard, some have inspired capitalists to criticize each other and conduct self-criticism; some trade union organizations regularly invite capitalists to hold forums to understand their requirements, and at the same time convey the opinions of the workers to them; some openly criticize them by name, and some conduct individual talks. The method of criticism can be varied, and the attitude must be sincere and realistic.

Lai Ruoyu emphasized the issue of democratization of enterprise management. He said that the democratization of enterprise management is one of the important hallmarks that distinguish socialist enterprises from capitalist enterprises. After the overall joint state-private ownership of private enterprises, the state has directly grasped the management power of the enterprises, and appointed public representatives. The administrative leaders of the enterprises and the masses of employees are already in a relationship of cooperation as comrades. Trade union organizations should strongly support the public representatives, stand with the public representatives, and overcome the difficulties that exist in the enterprises. Public representatives should also support trade union organizations and rely on the broad masses to improve enterprise management. However, at present, many enterprises have not properly implemented the principle of democratic management. Some public representatives one-sidedly emphasize administrative power, ignoring the democratic tradition of workers in private enterprises participating in enterprise management, and do not attach importance to absorbing workers to participate in enterprise leadership. The production plans, safety and welfare measures of individual enterprises are even kept "secret" from the trade union, which is inappropriate. Lai Ruoyu said that the implementation of democratic management requires the establishment of certain organizational structures. All enterprises must not only preserve the enterprise management committees (i.e., production increase and economy committees) from the private period, but also preserve and improve the workers' representative congresses. The enterprise management committee should be a permanent body under the leadership of the workers' representative congress, and also a body with power. The workers' representative congress and the management committee should have the power to decide on various issues of the enterprise within the scope of not violating the plans, decisions, and orders of the higher authorities. He emphasized that promoting worker cadres is also an important measure to implement democratic management. Trade union organizations should, in a planned way, recommend a number of worker backbones who have been tempered, can closely contact the masses, and have certain professional skills to take on leadership work in their units.

Regarding the issue of appropriately resolving the material welfare of the working masses, Lai Ruoyu believes that there are still many problems with the working conditions and living conditions of employees in joint state-private enterprises, which trade union organizations must pay close attention to. When solving these problems, it is necessary to proceed from reality and according to realistic conditions. For those problems that are not easy to solve at the moment, explanations should be given to the working masses. It must be explained to the masses that the most fundamental way to improve living standards is to strive to develop production. The working class must be diligent and thrifty, promote the spirit of hard struggle, and carry out the production increase and economy movement, so as to gradually improve their living standards on the basis of developing production. However, for those problems that have both conditions and do not require unified regulations, trade union organizations should actively urge the administrative side of the enterprise to solve them, and earnestly protect the interests of the workers in this regard, and dare to fight against bureaucracy.

Finally, Lai Ruoyu also talked about several issues in strengthening trade union construction.

Jia Tuofu, Director of the Fourth Office of the State Council, delivered a report to the conference this afternoon. He gave detailed explanations on issues such as production in joint state-private enterprises, economic reorganization, management systems, how administrative leaders should implement the mass line, and the relationship between public and private parties working together.

    全国公私合营企业工会基层干部大会开幕
    研究和改进公私合营企业的工会工作
    新华社23日讯　全国公私合营企业工会基层干部大会，今天上午在北京开幕。
    出席这次会议的有全国各省、市、自治区公私合营企业工会工作者一千零十五人，少数公私合营企业的党委书记、公方代表也参加了这个大会。
    会议的主要任务是：系统地研究和确定全行业公私合营后工会工作的方针任务，同时总结和交流一年来各地公私合营企业工会工作的经验。
    中华全国总工会主席赖若愚向大会作了“公私合营企业工会组织的当前任务”的报告。他说，全行业公私合营以后，企业所有制已经基本改变，资本家除了取得定息以外，企业已经完全由国家支配、使用和管理。工会组织今后的任务，就是继续团结、教育资本家，把他们逐渐改造成为自食其力的劳动者；有计划有步骤地按照社会主义经营管理原则，把合营企业改造成完全的社会主义企业，从而促进社会生产力的发展。
    赖若愚接着就公私合营企业的生产管理、团结教育改造资本家、企业管理民主化、适当解决工人群众的物质福利、工会建设等五个问题作了说明。在谈到企业的生产管理问题时，赖若愚指出，工会组织应该认识企业合营后在发展生产上已具备了过去所没有的良好条件，应该充分利用这些有利条件，积极组织群众开展社会主义竞赛和先进生产者运动，更好地发挥群众的积极性和创造才能。他说，工会组织还应该积极组织和发动工人、管理人员共同研究各种改进企业管理的办法，克服目前合营企业经营管理上的某些混乱现象。
    赖若愚在谈到关于团结、教育、改造资本家的问题时，对公私合营前后资本家发生的变化情况进行了分析。他说，为了帮助资本家进行自我改造，工会组织应该加强对资本家的工作。工会要争取更多的资本家参加社会主义竞赛，以便通过劳动实践来改造他们。对他们工作上的正确意见，应该像对工人一样给予支持；当他们有了贡献的时候，也应一视同仁地给予表扬和奖励。工会所举办的各种社会活动都可以吸收他们和他们的家属参加；工会某些会议也可邀请他们列席，以便使他们多和工人群众接近，以工人阶级的精神来感染他们。我们这样的照顾，目的就是推动资本家更快地进行自我改造。他说，目前资产阶级虽然一般是接受改造、趋向进步的，但是也有一小部分人存在着一些错误的思想和行为。例如有的人消极怠工，不负责任；有的人大手大脚，浪费企业财产，个别的还有贪污、盗窃，中饱私囊；有的人在有职有权以后趾高气扬，借故打击过去工会的积极分子；也有人心怀不满，对社会主义改造颇为敌视。对于这种错误思想行为应该进行适当的批评和斗争，这种批评和斗争的目的是为了团结、改造。过去各地已经有这方面的具体经验，有的启发资本家互相批评和自我批评；有的工会组织经常邀请资本家举行座谈会，了解他们的要求，同时把工人的意见转告他们；有的公开指名批评，有的进行个别谈话。批评的方式可以多种多样，态度一定要诚恳和实事求是。
    赖若愚着重谈到企业管理民主化的问题。他说，企业管理民主化是社会主义企业区别于资本主义企业的重要标志之一。私营企业在全行业公私合营以后，国家已经直接掌握了企业的管理权，委派了公方代表，企业行政领导和职工群众已经是同志合作关系，工会组织应该大力支持公方代表，和公方代表站在一起，克服目前企业中所存在的困难，公方代表也要支持工会组织，依靠广大群众来改进企业管理工作。但是目前有不少企业没有很好贯彻民主管理的原则，有的公股代表片面强调行政权力，忽视私营企业工人有参加企业管理的民主传统，不重视吸收工人参与企业领导，个别企业的生产计划、安全福利等措施甚至对工会“保密”，这是不适当的。赖若愚说，实行管理民主化需要建立一定的组织机构，各企业不但要保存私营时期的企业管理委员会（即增产节约委员会），还必须保存并且健全职工代表大会。企业管理委员会应该是职工代表大会领导下的常设机构，也是一个具有权力的机构。职工代表大会和管理委员会在不违反上级的计划、决定、命令的范围内，应该有权决定本企业的各种问题。他强调指出，提拔工人干部也是贯彻管理民主化的重要措施，工会组织要有计划地推荐一批经过锻炼、能够密切联系群众、有一定业务能力的工人骨干担任本单位的领导工作。
    关于适当解决工人群众的物质福利问题。赖若愚认为目前公私合营企业职工的劳动条件、生活条件上还存在不少问题，工会组织必须十分重视。在解决这些问题时应该实事求是地根据现实条件来进行，对那些一时不易解决的问题，要向工人群众进行解释。必须向群众说明，改善生活最根本的办法是努力发展生产，工人阶级必须克勤克俭，发扬艰苦奋斗的精神，开展增产节约运动，在发展生产的基础上，逐步改善自己的生活。但是对那些既有条件又无需统一规定的问题，工会组织就要积极督促本企业行政方面去解决，在这方面要认真保护工人利益，敢于和官僚主义作斗争。
    赖若愚最后还谈到加强工会建设中的几个问题。
    国务院第四办公室主任贾拓夫今天下午向大会作了报告。他就公私合营企业的生产、经济改组、管理制度、行政领导如何贯彻群众路线、公私双方共事关系等问题，作了详细的说明。
