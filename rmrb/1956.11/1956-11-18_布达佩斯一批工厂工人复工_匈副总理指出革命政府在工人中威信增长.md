Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, November 17th: The Budapest Central Workers' Council issued a call on the 16th, urging workers in Budapest factories that have not yet resumed work to immediately resume production.

Workers in six major factories in Budapest, including the "Ganz" Vehicle Manufacturing Plant, have decided to resume work today or at the latest on the 19th. Suburban railway traffic in Budapest, after a period of interruption, has now begun to recover. According to a report by Budapest Radio this morning, many workers have returned to work since the call was issued.

Up to recently, 80% of the shops in Budapest have resumed business, including more than 3,000 food stores and more than 1,000 shops selling various industrial products. More than 300 trucks are transporting goods for these shops. There are no more long queues for bread, but vegetables and potatoes are still in short supply due to transportation difficulties.

While the working people of Budapest are striving to restore normal life, some people are still spreading rumors and trying to prevent workers from going to work. In Pest Szentlőrinc, thugs opened fire on workers who had heeded the call and returned to work. However, despite this, the awakened workers are determined to resume work and fight against the saboteurs.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, November 16th: According to reports from "Neues Deutschland" and the German News Agency, Hungarian Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Armed Forces and Public Security Ferenc Münnich said when he met their reporters on November 14th that although groups of hostile elements are still active in some areas, their numbers are insignificant.

Münnich said that the fact that many workers' delegations visit the Prime Minister of the Revolutionary Government, János Kádár, every day proves the growing prestige of the government among the workers. They received answers to the questions they were interested in and expressed their wishes. The workers are increasingly aware that former Prime Minister Imre Nagy's hesitation almost led to the restoration of fascism in Hungary. In order to save the Hungarian people's democratic system, the assistance of the Soviet army was necessary.

Deputy Prime Minister Münnich said that the Hungarian Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government has firmly grasped the national power throughout the country. The government maintains regular contact with county-level agencies across the country that implement government orders. The central organs can now exercise their functions. The central state police have been established, in addition to the regular police, there are also workers' self-defense forces. Order has been restored in Budapest and throughout the country.

    布达佩斯一批工厂工人复工
    匈副总理指出革命政府在工人中威信增长
    据新华社布达佩斯17日电　布达佩斯中央工人委员会16日号召布达佩斯尚未复工的工厂的工人立即恢复生产工作。
    包括“甘兹”车辆制造厂在内的布达佩斯的六个大工厂的工人决定在今天或者至迟在19日复工。布达佩斯郊区的铁路交通经过一度中断以后，现在已经开始恢复了。据布达佩斯电台今天上午报道，在号召发出以后，许多工人都恢复了工作。
    到最近为止，布达佩斯已经有80％的商店恢复了营业，其中食品店有三千多家，出卖各种工业品的商店有一千多家。有三百多辆卡车在为这些商店运输货物。现在再没有排成长队购买面包的现象了，但是，由于运输上的困难，蔬菜和马铃薯仍然感到不足。
    在布达佩斯劳动人民努力恢复正常生活的同时，有一些人还在散布谣言，尽力阻止工人上工。在佩斯秦特劳伦斯，暴徒曾经向已经听从号召回去工作的工人开枪。但是，尽管如此，已经觉醒过来的工人坚持要恢复工作，同破坏分子展开斗争。
    新华社柏林16日电　据“新德意志报”和德意志通讯社报道，匈牙利工农革命政府副总理兼武装部队和公安部部长费伦茨·明尼赫在11月14日接见他们的记者的时候说，虽然在某些地区，敌对分子集团还在活动，但是，他们的人数是微不足道的。
    明尼赫说，每天有许多工人代表团访问革命政府总理卡达尔一事，证明了政府在工人中威信的增长。他们得到了对他们感兴趣的问题的回答，并且说出了自己的愿望。工人们日益明白了，前总理伊姆雷·纳吉的迟疑差一点就造成了法西斯主义在匈牙利国内的复辟。为了拯救匈牙利的人民民主制度，苏联军队的援助是必要的。
    明尼赫副总理说，匈牙利工农革命政府已经牢牢地掌握了全国的国家权力。政府同各地执行政府命令的县级机关保持经常的接触。中央的机关又能行使职权了。中央的国家警察建立起来了，除了正规警察以外，还有工人组成的自卫队。布达佩斯和全国都恢复了秩序。
