    Changes in Low-Yield Fields
    In Pengxing Township, Xiaogan County, Hubei Province, low-yield fields account for about 14% of the township's total paddy fields. The soil is barren, weeds are rampant, and cultivation is very inconvenient. In the past, most of these fields belonged to poor farmers, who had no choice but to adopt a method of extensive planting and low yields. It was not until the winter of last year, when the vast majority of farmers in the township joined advanced agricultural cooperatives, that the township's CPC branch decided to transform low-yield fields into high-yield fields and achieve balanced production increases for various grain crops, as an important measure for the township to achieve a grain yield of 1,000 jin per mu this year. Therefore, with the help of agricultural technicians, the agricultural cooperatives invested twice or even several times more manpower and resources in low-yield fields than in ordinary farmland. The members implemented a series of production reforms based on the specific conditions of soil quality, etc. As a result, the grain yield of these low-yield fields increased by more than double compared to last year.

    低产田的变化
    湖北省孝感县朋兴乡约占全乡水田总面积14％的低产田，都是土质瘠薄，野草丛生，耕作十分不便。过去这些田绝大部分属于贫困农民，他们不得不采取广种薄收的办法。直到去年冬季全乡绝大部分农民参加高级农业社以后，这个乡的中共支部便决定把改造低产田成为高产田，做到各种粮食作物平衡增产，作为全乡在今年实现每亩产粮食一千斤的计划的一项重要措施。于是在农业技术干部的帮助下，各农业社对低产田投入了比一般农田多一倍甚至几倍的人力和物力。社员们根据土质等具体条件的不同，分别推行了一系列的生产改革。结果，这些低产田的粮食产量比去年增加了一倍多。　（新华社）
