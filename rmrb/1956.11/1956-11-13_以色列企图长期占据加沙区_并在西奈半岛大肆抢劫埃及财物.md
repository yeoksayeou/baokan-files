Xinhua News Agency, November 12th. TASS, November 11th: Although the United Nations General Assembly emergency meeting has clearly decided that the British, French, and Israeli troops should withdraw from Egypt, many facts disclosed by well-informed sources prove that Israel is unwilling to withdraw its troops from the Gaza Strip in Egypt.

    The Israeli authorities have already appointed village chiefs in various parts of the Gaza Strip, opened post offices and laid telephone lines, and are hurriedly repairing roads and railways in various parts of the Gaza Strip in order to restore traffic connecting Tel Aviv. To achieve this goal, many workers have been transferred from Tel Aviv to Gaza. Israel is even preparing to replace Egyptian currency with Israeli currency in the market.

    Israeli newspapers are vigorously advocating the immediate transfer of "thousands of Jews, as voluntary immigrants to Gaza," into the Gaza Strip, and are calling on them to move into houses left by Arabs. The Israeli authorities are carrying out large-scale arrests of Egyptian residents in Gaza.

    At the same time, the Israeli authorities realize that the Israeli army will inevitably have to withdraw from the Sinai Peninsula, which belongs to Egypt, so they are systematically looting property on the peninsula. Grain from granaries, livestock, and all property are being hurriedly transported from the Sinai Peninsula across the ceasefire line into Israel. Temporary warehouses and houses are being hurriedly built on Israeli territory near the military demarcation line to accommodate the Egyptian property looted from the Sinai Peninsula.

    The Israeli aggressor group makes no secret of its aggressive intentions towards Egypt. The pro-government "Davar" wrote on November 7th: "Any attempt to restore the old situation in the Suez Canal issue or in the relations between Israel and the Arabs will only complicate the situation and aggravate the danger." The newspaper also said that the Gaza Strip and Tiran Island should be incorporated into Israel, and Israel's eastern border should be "revised."

    After Israeli Prime Minister Ben-Gurion issued a statement on November 8th that Israeli troops would withdraw from Egypt after the international police force entered the canal area, "Davar" wrote on November 9th, "Israel cannot bear the responsibility for the risks in Israel's political situation and international environment." However, the newspaper immediately explained that Prime Minister Ben-Gurion's statement on November 8th meant that the time limit and conditions for Israel's withdrawal had not yet been confirmed, and that Israel would not withdraw its troops from the Sinai Peninsula and allow Egyptian troops to enter that area.

    The newspaper also said that Ben-Gurion's statement did not mention the fate of the Gaza Strip and Tiran Island in the Gulf of Aqaba. The newspaper said, "Israel will demand to obtain the territory of Palestine occupied by Egypt, and guarantee freedom of passage through Eilat (Israel's port on the Gulf of Aqaba)."

Xinhua News Agency, November 12th. United Press reporter Tuckman reported from Tel Aviv: On November 11th, Israeli troops were rushing to transport materials seized from the Egyptians out of the Sinai Peninsula.

    The General Command of the Israeli army intends to transport a large amount of "spoils of war" out of the peninsula before withdrawing its troops from the Sinai Peninsula to allow the United Nations International Police Force to enter.

    Long convoys of Israeli trucks are heading east, accelerating the transportation of Egyptian materials.

    It seems that the Israelis will probably take everything that can be used or repaired, and destroy the rest.

    No announcement has been made as to which day Israel will actually begin to withdraw its troops.

    A Foreign Ministry spokesman said that this depends on which day the international police force enters the area.

Xinhua News Agency, November 12th. TASS, New York, November 11th: Some reports in the American newspapers reflect that some groups in the United States are instigating Israel not to comply with the United Nations General Assembly resolution on the immediate withdrawal of Israeli troops from Egyptian territory.

    A dispatch from Tel Aviv by a "New York Times" reporter said that Israel "does not intend to return to the 1949 borders." "New York American Journal" publisher Hearst "proved" that "Israel should obtain the Gaza Strip."

    A "New York Herald Tribune" reporter praised "Israel's firm determination to maintain Gaza."

### 以色列企图长期占据加沙区  并在西奈半岛大肆抢劫埃及财物

    以色列企图长期占据加沙区
    并在西奈半岛大肆抢劫埃及财物
    新华社12日讯　据塔斯社11日讯：虽然联合国大会紧急会议已经明确地决定英、法、以三国军队撤出埃及，但是，据消息灵通人士披露的许多事实证明，以色列不愿意从埃及的加沙地区撤军。
    以色列当局已经在加沙地区各地任命了村长，开设了邮局和敷设了电话线，并且正在加沙地区各地赶紧修理公路和铁路，以便恢复联系特拉维夫的交通。为了达到这个目的，从特拉维夫调了许多工人到加沙去。以色列甚至准备着用以色列货币来代替埃及货币在市面上流通。
    以色列报刊大力鼓吹立刻把“数千名犹太人，作为前往加沙的志愿移民”移入加沙地区，并且叫他们迁入阿拉伯人留下的房屋。以色列当局正在大规模地逮捕加沙的埃及居民。
    同时，以色列当局意识到以色列军队将会不可避免地要撤离属于埃及的西奈半岛，因此它正在有系统地抢劫半岛上的财物。粮仓里的粮食、牲畜以及一切财物正在匆匆忙忙地从西奈半岛经过停战线运往以色列境内。在军事分界线附近的以色列领土上，正在赶紧建筑临时仓库和房屋以便容纳从西奈半岛上抢劫来的埃及财物。
    以色列侵略集团毫不隐讳对埃及的侵略意图。亲政府的“达瓦尔报”在11月7日写道：“任何试图恢复苏伊士运河问题上或是以色列和阿拉伯人之间的关系方面的老局面的做法都只会使情况复杂化，使危险性加重”。报纸还说，加沙地区和蒂朗岛应当归并以色列，以色列的东部边界应当“修改”。
    在以色列总理本—古里安11月8日发表关于以色列军队将在国际警察部队开入运河地区后撤出埃及的声明以后，“达瓦尔报”11月9日写道，“以色列不能为以色列的政局和国际环境承担冒险的责任”。但是，这家报纸立即解释说，本—古里安总理11月8日的声明意味着，以色列撤军的期限和条件还没有肯定，而且以色列不会把军队撤出西奈半岛而让埃及军队进入那个地方。
    报纸又说，本—古里安的声明中没有谈到加沙地区和亚喀巴湾的蒂朗岛的命运。报纸说，“以色列将要求获得为埃及所占领的巴勒斯坦的领土，以及保证通过埃拉特（以色列在亚喀巴湾沿岸的港口）的自由。”
    新华社12日讯　据美联社记者塔克曼从特拉维夫报道：以色列军队11月11日在把他们从埃及人手里夺取的物资赶运出西奈半岛。
    以色列军队的总司令部打算在从西奈半岛撤出它的军队以便让联合国国际警察部队进来以前，把大量“战利品”运出这个半岛。
    长列的以色列卡车队在往东开，加速运出埃及的物资。
    看来，以色列人大概会拿走可以利用或者修理的一切东西，把其余的东西毁掉。
    并没有宣布以色列将在那一天真正开始撤出军队。
    外交部发言人说，这要看国际警察部队那一天开入这个地区而定。
    新华社12日讯　据塔斯社纽约11日讯：从美国报纸的一些报道中反映出美国某些集团正在唆使以色列不要服从联合国大会关于立即从埃及领土撤退以色列军队的决议。
    “纽约时报”记者从特拉维夫发出的一条消息说，以色列“不打算回到1949年的界线后面来”。“纽约美国人日报”发行人赫斯特“证明”，“以色列应该获得加沙区”。
    “纽约先驱论坛报”记者赞扬“以色列保持加沙的坚定决心”。
