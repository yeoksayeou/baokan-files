Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, November 13th. The Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China recently convened a provincial industrial conference, deciding to implement the spirit of the Eighth National Congress of the Party and strengthen the Party's leadership over industry.

The conference pointed out the achievements of Hebei Province in developing industry in recent years, but believes that the Provincial Committee has relaxed its leadership over industry in the past two years or more due to the increasing tasks of agricultural production and socialist transformation. Because the Provincial Committee did not tightly grasp the leadership of industry, the local committees and county committees gradually relaxed their leadership of industrial work and the support and cooperation of various departments to industry, and the problems in industrial production and construction were not resolved in a timely manner.

The meeting reflected that some cadres are also unclear about how rural work and agricultural production can support national industrial construction. Some areas even oppose industrial and agricultural production. For example, after the high tide of agricultural cooperation this year, some agricultural cooperatives have over-restricted their members from going out to work, and some places have even brought back many workers and transportation vehicles in the city to participate in agricultural cooperatives, causing difficulties in the shortage of labor and transportation in urban construction and industrial production. Many regional party committees neglected to lead industry, such as the unsound organization of industrial leadership in many places, the incomplete allocation of industrial cadres for a long time, and some places even transferred industrial cadres, even factory directors and factory accountants, to "contract villages" and "contract cooperatives" to engage in rural work for a long time. Some provincial non-industrial departments did not pay enough attention to the situation in cities and factories and how to promote industrial development when studying policies and arranging work; some economic departments lacked a clear perspective on developing production, and often failed to solve small profits, contracts, procedures, and other issues for a long time, which affected the development of industrial production. The conference believes that these situations should be quickly reversed.

The conference pointed out that party committees at all levels should conduct in-depth education among all party members and cadres, earnestly study and implement the resolutions of the "Eighth National Congress," and especially establish the idea of comprehensively promoting the development of the entire national economy in leadership and strengthen leadership over industry. Rural work should vigorously support industrial construction in all aspects. At present, agricultural production should ensure the completion of the production tasks of cash crops in accordance with the national plan, providing sufficient industrial raw materials for the increasingly developed industrial production; at the same time, it is necessary to ensure the labor force required for capital construction and industrial production development, rationally organize the transportation capacity of agricultural cooperatives, and actively serve industrial construction and material exchanges.

The conference determined specific measures to strengthen and improve the Party's leadership over industrial construction. Party committees at all levels should put leadership of industrial construction on the regular agenda, strengthen the Party's collective leadership, and assign a special person to be responsible for industrial work in the division of labor of the party secretary, and establish and improve the Party and government industrial management organizations at all levels. The meeting also proposed to strengthen the collective leadership of the Party in enterprises, implement the factory director responsibility system under the leadership of the Party committee, improve and strengthen the Party's grassroots work, change the backwardness of the Party's grassroots work in many units, and build the Party's collective leadership on the basis of the mass line, strengthen the democratic management of enterprises, and gradually implement the system of employee congresses or employee representative congresses by adopting the method of key experiments.

The conference also discussed and made specific arrangements for further deepening the advanced producer movement, caring for and gradually improving the lives of workers, improving product (project) quality, and improving purchase and sales relationships in the current industrial work.

    中共河北省委工业会议决定加强对工业的领导
    认为省委最近两年来对工业的领导有些放松，今后应当注意全面的促进工农业的发展，要求各级党委把领导工业建设放到经常的议事日程上来
    新华社保定13日电　中共河北省委员会最近召开了全省工业会议，决定贯彻党的第八次全国代表大会的精神，加强党对工业的领导。
    会议指出了河北省几年来发展工业方面的成绩，但是认为省委在最近两年多来，因为农业生产和社会主义改造任务加重，对工业的领导放松了。由于省委对工业的领导抓的不紧，各地委、县委对工业工作的领导以及各部门对工业的支援与配合就渐渐放松了，对工业生产建设方面的问题也解决得很不及时。
    会上反映出有些干部对于农村工作、农业生产如何支持国家工业建设的思想也不明确，有的地区甚至把工农业生产对立起来。如在今年农业合作化高潮以后，有些农业社对社员外出做工限制过严，有些地方还把不少城市里的工人和运输工具拉回来参加农业社，造成城市建设和工业生产上劳力和运输力不足的困难。不少地区党委忽视领导工业，如不少地方领导工业的组织不健全，工业干部很长时期配备不全，有的地方甚至抽调工业干部以至厂长、工厂会计等人去“包乡”“包社”，长期做农村工作。省级有些非工业部门，在研究政策布置工作时，对于城市、厂矿中的情况以及怎样才更有利于促进工业的发展，注意得很不够；有的经济事业部门，缺乏明确的发展生产的观点，常为一些小的利润、合同、手续等问题，长期不加以解决，以致影响工业生产的发展。会议认为，这些情况都是应该迅速扭转的。
    会议指出：各级党委应当在全体党员干部中进行深刻的教育，认真地学习和贯彻执行“八大”的决议，特别是在领导上要树立全面的促进整个国民经济发展的思想，加强对工业的领导。农村工作应当从各方面大力支持工业建设。在目前，农业生产应当保证按照国家计划完成经济作物的生产任务，为日益发展的工业生产提供充足的工业原料；同时要保证基本建设和工业生产发展所需要的劳动力，合理地组织农业社的运输力量；积极地为工业建设和物资交流服务。
    会议确定了加强和改进党对工业建设的领导的各项具体措施。各级党委要把领导工业建设放到经常的议事日程上来，加强党的集体领导，党委书记分工中要有专人负责管理工业工作，建立和健全各级党政管理工业的机构。会议还提出要加强企业党的集体领导，实行党委领导下的厂长负责制，改进和加强党的基层工作，改变目前许多单位党的基层工作落后的状况，以及把党的集体领导建筑在群众路线的基础上，加强企业的民主管理，并且采取重点试验的办法，逐步推行职工大会或职工代表大会的制度等。
    会议还对目前工业工作中的进一步深入开展先进生产者运动、关心与逐步改善职工生活、改进产品（工程）质量、改进购销关系等问题分别经过讨论，并且作了具体布置和安排。
