Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, November 4th: The Bulgarian newspaper "Workers' Cause" published an editorial on November 3rd stating: In recent days, the Hungarian events have undergone new changes and continue to cause serious unease. Fascist counter-revolutionary forces are running rampant openly and shamelessly, attempting to take advantage of the current chaos to overthrow the people's democratic system and restore the dictatorship of the capitalists. All kinds of unidentified elements and former Horthy officers are crawling out of their dark caves.

    The enemies of the people and the people's democratic regime are slaughtering Hungarian patriots. All sorts of "delegations" have appeared, putting forward naked counter-revolutionary slogans and demands. Budapest has once again fallen into a state of extreme chaos. Armed groups are attacking institutions in a despicable manner, attempting to destroy the staff of state organs. Cultural relics have been barbarically destroyed. On November 1st, the Statue of Liberty on Gellért Hill was destroyed. The personnel of the Party and state security organs, workers, and honest Hungarian patriots are in a very difficult situation. Savage bandits and fascist groups are spreading terror and death. Despicable assassinations, sudden attacks, bloody persecution - these are the deeds of contemptible enemies of the people.

    斥责霍尔蒂分子暴行
    新华社4日讯　据塔斯社索非亚讯：保加利亚“工人事业报”11月3日发表的一篇编辑部文章说：近几天来，匈牙利事件发生了新的变化，并且继续使人感到严重的不安。法西斯反革命势力，公开无耻地猖獗起来，他们企图利用目前的混乱局面，推翻人民民主制度，恢复资本家的独裁统治。各种各样来历不明的分子和前霍尔蒂军官都从黑暗的洞穴里钻出来。
    人民和人民民主政权的死敌正在屠杀匈牙利的爱国者。形形色色的“代表团”出现了，它们提出赤裸裸的反革命口号和要求。布达佩斯再一次陷入极端混乱的状态中。武装集团卑鄙地袭击机关，企图摧残国家机关工作人员。文化古迹被野蛮地毁坏。11月1日，格列尔特山上的自由像被毁坏了。党和国家保安机关的工作人员、工人和正直的匈牙利爱国者陷于非常艰难的情况。野蛮的匪帮和法西斯集团正在散布恐怖和死亡。卑鄙的暗杀，突然的袭击，血腥的迫害——这就是可鄙的人民敌人的勾当。
