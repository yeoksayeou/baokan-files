Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 3rd - The Indonesian Parliament unanimously passed a resolution on the evening of November 2nd, demanding that the United Nations declare Britain and France aggressors and take sanctions against them.

The resolution stated that the "barbaric" actions of Britain and France violated the principles of the United Nations Charter, and tolerating such actions could cause the world organization to lose prestige among its member states.

The resolution supports the measures taken by the Indonesian government regarding this act of aggression and supports the government's further efforts in the spirit of Asian-African solidarity.

The resolution also requests the Indonesian government to make greater efforts in international organizations such as the United Nations and the Asian-African Conference to strive for the swift withdrawal of British, French, and Israeli troops from Egypt. If these three countries refuse the recommendations of world organizations, the government should consider further, firmer steps, such as severing diplomatic relations with these aggressor countries.

Before the parliament passed this resolution, Foreign Minister Abdurgani delivered a statement on the Middle East situation at the plenary session of parliament.

The Indonesian Foreign Minister condemned Britain and France for preferring to resolve the Suez dispute on the battlefield rather than at the negotiating table.

Abdurgani said: "This action by Britain and France has already created a new trend in international relations, that is, it seems that big countries can arbitrarily annex small countries, and former suzerain states can use standard 19th-century colonial methods to re-enslave other countries. If this situation is tolerated, then the world political map will revert to the pre-World War II or 19th-century state."

The Foreign Minister said: Egypt's current fate has a great impact on the fate of countries east of the Suez Canal. "Therefore, the situation in the Middle East has aroused the concern of the government. This is not only because we must prevent the outbreak of a third world war, but also because we are worried that our sovereignty and independence may suffer the same fate as Egypt is currently experiencing."

The Foreign Minister told the parliamentarians that Prime Minister Sastroamidjojo had appealed to the Prime Ministers of the Colombo Conference countries, namely Burma, India, Ceylon, and Pakistan, to convene an emergency meeting to discuss the Middle East crisis. His government will do its best to cooperate with Asian and African countries and other friendly countries outside the region to defend Egypt's independence and sovereignty.

After Abdurgani's speech, many parliamentarians spoke in support of the government's position on this issue.

In response to questions from parliamentarians, Abdurgani said that the current efforts include the following four points: 1. Inviting Asian and African countries to take joint action to stop the war; 2. Providing specific assistance to Egypt, such as providing assistance through the Red Cross; 3. Mobilizing public opinion to sanction the aggressors; 4. Condemning the aggression.

    印度尼西亚国会通过决议
    要求联合国宣布英法为侵略者
    阿卜杜加尼说将邀请亚非国家共同制止侵埃战争
    据新华社雅加达3日电　印度尼西亚国会11月2日晚一致通过决议，要求联合国宣布英法为侵略者，并且采取制裁行动。
    决议说，英法的“蛮横”行动违背了联合国宪章的原则，容忍这种行动就可能使这个世界组织在它的会员国中丧失威信。
    决议支持印度尼西亚政府就这种侵略行动采取的措施，并且支持政府本着亚非团结的精神所作的进一步努力。
    决议还要求印度尼西亚政府在像联合国组织和亚非会议等国际组织内作更大的努力，来争取使英、法、以三国军队迅速撤出埃及。如果这三国拒绝世界组织的建议，政府就应当考虑下一步更坚定的步骤，例如，同这些侵略国家断绝外交关系。
    在国会通过这项决议以前，外交部长阿卜杜加尼在国会全体会议上发表了政府关于中东局势的声明。
    印度尼西亚外交部长谴责英国和法国不愿意在谈判桌上而愿意在战场上解决苏伊士争端。
    阿卜杜加尼说：“英法的这个行动已经在国际关系中制造了新的趋向，那就是，看来大国可以专断地并吞小国，以前的宗主国可以使用标准的十九世纪殖民主义手段来重新给别的国家套上锁链。如果容忍这种情况，那么世界政治地图将恢复到第二次世界大战以前或者十九世纪的样子。”
    外交部长说：埃及在目前的命运对苏伊士运河东面的国家的命运有极大的影响。“因此，中东的情况已经引起了政府的关心。这不仅是因为我们必须阻止第三次世界大战爆发，而且是因为我们担心我们的主权和独立可能会遭到埃及目前所遭遇到的那种命运。”
    外交部长告诉议员们说，沙斯特罗阿米佐约总理已经向缅甸、印度、锡兰和巴基斯坦这些科伦坡会议国家的总理呼吁召开紧急会议来讨论中东危机。他的政府将尽最大的力量和亚非国家以及这个地区以外的其他友好国家进行合作以保卫埃及的独立和主权。
    在阿卜杜加尼发言以后，很多议员发言支持政府在这个问题上的立场。
    阿卜杜加尼在答复议员的问题的时候说，目前进行的努力包括下面四点：一、邀请亚非国家采取共同行动来制止战争；二、给予埃及具体的援助，例如通过红十字会给予援助；三、动员舆论制裁侵略者；四、谴责侵略。
