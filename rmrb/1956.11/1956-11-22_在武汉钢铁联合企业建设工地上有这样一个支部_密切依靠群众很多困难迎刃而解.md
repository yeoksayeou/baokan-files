Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, November 20th. Recently, the exemplary deeds of the Chinese Communist Party branch of the Third Construction Site of the Concrete Engineering Company in the Wuhan Iron and Steel Complex construction site, which is good at relying on the masses, has been circulating. This construction site, in undertaking the construction of a water pump station project, has been able to solve many difficulties smoothly because it can consult with the workers on everything.

Not long ago, the construction site began the construction of the water pump station substation. However, the new technology of pouring dry-hard concrete mixed with rubble adopted in this project made both the site leaders and technicians feel lack of confidence; although before construction, the site had organized concrete workers to learn the method of pouring dry-hard concrete at other sites. Therefore, the Party branch of the construction site mobilized the concrete workers to discuss it, and Han Xi, a member of the Party branch committee and director of the construction site, braved the rain to consult with the workers in the evening. As a result, the workers put forward many useful methods and construction measures. After pouring, the quality of all the dry-hard concrete mixed with rubble was very good.

Before the start of the water pump station project, difficulties were encountered in building scaffolding, because the construction site lacked the building materials specified in the original design—Chinese fir and iron wire. It seemed that the construction period would be affected as a result. The leaders of the construction site went to consult with the carpenters and scaffolders and got their support to replace the designed Chinese fir and iron wire with bamboo and straw ropes, which are abundant in the South. After testing, the load-bearing capacity of the scaffolding built with bamboo and straw ropes fully met the requirements.

Now, consulting with the masses on everything has become a regular working method of this construction site. The monthly work plan, after being discussed by the Party branch committee, is handed over to the construction site and various work sections and teams for comments; or an enlarged meeting of the Party branch committee is held to absorb more people to participate in the joint discussion. The formulation of each construction plan is preceded by inviting the heads of the work teams and experienced technical workers on the construction site to study together; before the formal construction of each project, a detailed technical briefing is given to the workers, and the opinions of the workers are listened to.

The main members of the Party branch committee of this construction site all have good work styles. In the evenings, on weekends, or on holidays, Li Baohua, deputy secretary of the Party branch, and Han Xi, member of the Party branch committee and director of the construction site, often went to the workers' dormitories or workers' homes to chat and visit, so they were able to understand the workers' urgent demands in a timely manner and find ways to solve them. This summer, the workers of this construction site had just come to the South from the Northeast. Some workers were not used to the hot weather in the South and once asked to return to the Northeast. At that time, the Party branch immediately worked with the administrative side to strengthen the site's heat prevention work, built sunshades, and supplied salt soda, mung bean soup and other cooling drinks. At the same time, through individual talks and various meetings, ideological education was carried out for the workers. Later, the thoughts of these workers who once asked to return to the Northeast were stabilized, and some have become advanced producers on the construction site.

### 在武汉钢铁联合企业建设工地上有这样一个支部  密切依靠群众很多困难迎刃而解

    在武汉钢铁联合企业建设工地上有这样一个支部
    密切依靠群众很多困难迎刃而解
    新华社武汉20日电　武汉钢铁联合企业建设工地上，最近流传着混凝土工程公司三工地的中国共产党支部善于依靠群众的典范事例。这个工地在担负一项水泵站工程施工中，因为能够遇事和职工群众商量，使得许多困难都顺利地解决了。
    不久前，工地开始了水泵站变电所的建筑工程。但是，这项工程所采用的浇灌干硬性混凝土掺片石的新技术，无论工地领导人员或技术人员，都感到信心不足；虽然在施工前，工地曾组织混凝土工人到其他工地学习过浇灌干硬性混凝土的方法。于是，工地党支部发动了混凝土工人进行讨论，党支部委员、工地主任韩喜并在晚上冒雨找工人商量。结果，工人们提出了很多有用的办法和施工措施。经过浇灌，这次干硬性混凝土掺片石的全部工程质量都很好。
    在水泵站工程开工以前，搭脚手架遇到了困难，因为当时工地上缺乏原设计中规定的建筑材料——杉木和铁丝。眼看工期将要因此受到影响。工地领导人员就去和木工、架子工商量并得到他们的支持，改用南方盛产的竹子和草绳代替了设计规定的杉木和铁丝。经过试验，用竹子、草绳搭起的脚手架，承重能力完全合乎要求。
    现在，遇事和群众商量已经成为这个工地的经常的工作方法。每月的工作计划，经过党的支委会讨论后，就交给工地和各工段、队征求意见；或者就召开党的支委扩大会议，吸收更多的人员参加共同讨论。每项施工方案的制定，事前都邀请工地上的班、组长和老技术工人一起研究；每项工程正式施工前，都向工人进行详细的技术交底工作，并且听取工人们的意见。
    这个工地党支部委员会的主要成员，都具有良好的工作作风。一到晚上、每逢周末或者假日，党支部副书记李宝华和党支部委员、工地主任韩喜就经常到工人宿舍或工人家庭里谈天、访问，因此他们能够及时了解工人们的迫切要求，并且设法解决。今年夏天，这个工地的职工刚从东北地区来到南方，一部分工人过不惯南方的酷热日子，曾经要求回东北。当时，党支部立即和行政方面一道，加强工地防暑工作，搭凉棚，供应盐汽水、绿豆汤等解暑饮料，同时通过个别谈话和各种会议，对工人进行思想教育。后来，这些一度要求回东北的工人，思想都安定下来，有的已经成为工地上的先进生产者了。
