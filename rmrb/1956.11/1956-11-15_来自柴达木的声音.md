    A Voice from Qaidam
    ·Qi·
    People living in Qaidam have an inconvenience, which is that they cannot see newspapers for a long time. For example, on October 13th, we had not yet seen the October 1st newspaper. For comrades who do not have a radio, this is really unpleasant.
    The "Beijing" brand radio only costs about ninety yuan each, and every employee living in Qaidam can afford it. It's a pity that the Mang'ai Trading Company does not carry this product.
    One day, I met Section Chief Yang of the Mang'ai Trading Company and casually brought up this request.
    "Too many problems!" Section Chief Yang said.
    "The employees really need it."
    "Too many problems!" Section Chief Yang said again, "Buying radios requires registration, it's difficult to transport on the road, and whether they can be sold after they are transported is also a problem..."
    "There is no problem selling two hundred units in the Qaidam Basin," I said.
    "The organs that need radios should sign contracts with us, pay in advance, and after we buy them, we will deliver the goods, and we are not responsible for whether they are good or bad..." Section Chief Yang said confidently.
    Arguing like this will certainly not lead to any results. At this time, I also remembered a few things: the Mang'ai Trading Company has lighters, but does not sell flints; only "Big Roman" brand watches are available; female employees in Mang'ai city cannot buy toilet paper...
    Are these problems really impossible to solve?

    来自柴达木的声音
    ·琦·
    生活在柴达木的人有一种不方便，那就是长时间看不到报纸。举例说：10月13日，我们还没有看到10月1日的报纸。对于没有收音机的同志，这味道真不好受。
    “北京牌”的收音机，每部不过九十元左右，生活在柴达木的职工谁也买得起。可惜的是茫崖贸易公司不经营这商品。
    一天，我遇上了茫崖贸易公司的杨股长，顺便提出了这个要求。
    “问题多！”杨股长说。
    “职工们挺需要。”
    “问题多！”杨股长又说，“买收音机要登记，路上不好运，运来卖掉卖不掉都是问题……”
    “柴达木盆地销二百部是没有问题的。”我说。
    “要收音机的机关给我们订合同，先交款，买来以后交货，好坏我们不管……”杨股长理直气壮地说。
    这样争下去，当然不可能有结果。这时我又想起了几件事：茫崖贸易公司有打火机，可是不卖火石；手表只有“大罗马”一种；茫崖市的女职工买不到草纸……。
    难道这些问题真是不能解决的吗？
