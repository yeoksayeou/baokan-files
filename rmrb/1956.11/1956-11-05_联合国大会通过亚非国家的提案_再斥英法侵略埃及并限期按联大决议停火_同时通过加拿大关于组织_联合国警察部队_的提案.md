Xinhua News Agency, November 4th, New York Dispatch: The United Nations General Assembly held another emergency meeting on November 3rd at the request of the Egyptian representative to discuss the issue of British, French, and Israeli aggression against Egypt. The meeting passed the proposal of the Asian-African countries and the proposal of Canada.

　　Egyptian representative Loutfi spoke first. He said that the United Nations must take steps to end the aggression and restore peace. Egypt is a peace-loving country, but it has suffered the brutal armed aggression of two major powers. He said, "Egypt is defending itself and will continue to defend itself. The situation is deteriorating. The threat of escalating war is constantly present. People all over the world place their hopes on you, please do not disappoint them."

　　U.S. Representative Lodge put forward two proposals. One was a proposal on the Suez issue, and the other was a proposal on the Palestine issue.

　　The U.S. proposal on the Suez issue advocated establishing a committee composed of several countries to be responsible for: (1) Taking measures to immediately reopen the Suez Canal as a reliable international waterway; (2) Preparing, in consultation with Egypt, France, and Britain, a plan for the management and maintenance of the Suez Canal and the freedom of navigation of the canal, which shall comply with the 1888 Convention and the six principles previously adopted by the Security Council regarding the settlement of the Suez issue; (3) Adopting and implementing the above plan. The proposal also stipulated that the committee should report to the General Assembly and the Security Council at the appropriate time, and invite the committee to put forward recommendations it deems beneficial to promote a just and lasting solution to the Suez issue in accordance with the purposes and principles of the United Nations. The United Nations member states should provide the committee with all appropriate assistance.

　　The proposal on the Palestine issue advocated that the Palestine Conciliation Commission established in accordance with the United Nations General Assembly resolution of December 11, 1948, should cease to carry out its mission, and a committee composed of five members should be established. This committee will: (1) Prepare, after consultation with the parties signing the 1949 General Armistice Agreement, recommendations on resolving the outstanding major issues between the Arab states and Israel, with the aim of establishing lasting peace and stability in the region; (2) Submit the committee's recommendations to the parties concerned and to the General Assembly, or, where appropriate, to the Security Council, and report to the General Assembly on the work entrusted to the committee. The proposal also requested the Secretary-General, in cooperation with the committee, to continue to mediate with the parties; and requested the United Nations member states to provide the committee with all appropriate assistance.

　　Iraqi Representative Jawdat said: The important responsibility of the General Assembly is to stop the aggressors and safeguard its power. Everyone here recognizes the danger of three countries refusing to obey the resolutions of the General Assembly. The fact that there has been no ceasefire in accordance with the resolution clearly shows that the above countries do not respect the power of the United Nations or international law. This is violence, and they are now applying violence through their land, sea, and air forces. The Nazis and Fascists never recognized the power of the League of Nations. How do these countries compare with the Nazis and Fascists? Like the Nazis did, they want to turn the clock back.

　　Jawdat said: While we hope that the member states of this organization will rise up to oppose the contemptuous attitude of the aggressors, we find that all appeasement factors are gathered in the two American proposals.

　　Indian Representative Lal once again condemned the British and French aggression and, on behalf of nineteen Asian-African countries, put forward a proposal that said: "The General Assembly,
　　"Regretting that not all parties concerned have agreed to fulfill the terms of the resolution it adopted on November 2, 1956, noting that this resolution gives special priority to an immediate ceasefire and special priority to stopping the transfer of military forces and weapons into the region as part of the ceasefire,
　　"Further noting that this resolution requires the parties signing the armistice agreement to immediately withdraw all forces behind the armistice line, stop intrusions into neighboring territories through the armistice line, and fully comply with the terms of the armistice agreement,
　　"1. Reaffirms the General Assembly's resolution of November 2, 1956, and once again requests all parties to immediately agree to the terms of the above resolution;
　　"2. Authorizes the Secretary-General to immediately arrange with the parties concerned for the implementation of a ceasefire and the cessation of the transfer of troops and military supplies into the region, and requests him to submit a report of approval immediately, or in any event no later than twelve hours from the adoption of this resolution;
　　"3. Requests the Secretary-General, with the assistance of the Chief of Staff and personnel of the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization, to facilitate the withdrawal of all forces behind the armistice line.
　　"4. Decides to reconvene immediately upon receipt of the report from the Secretary-General mentioned in the substantive second paragraph of this resolution."

　　Canadian Representative Pearson then spoke and put forward a new proposal advocating the organization of a so-called "United Nations Police Force" stationed in the Middle East. The proposal said:
　　"The General Assembly,
　　"Recognizing the urgent need to facilitate the implementation of the resolution of November 2…
　　"Requests the Secretary-General, as a matter of priority, to submit to the General Assembly within forty-eight hours a plan, agreed to by the countries concerned, for the composition of a United Nations international emergency force, the mission of which is to ensure and supervise the cessation of hostilities in accordance with the terms of the above resolution."

　　U.S. Representative Lodge immediately expressed support for the Canadian proposal. He said he was "very pleased" with the proposal and did not intend to insist on a vote on the U.S. proposal.

　　Soviet Representative Sobolev said that Britain and France had not only refused to accept the resolution of the United Nations General Assembly, but had also trampled on this resolution. Britain and France have challenged international conscience and morality.

　　Sobolev said that before the British and French attack on Egypt, the Suez Canal was unobstructed. And now, due to the British and French bombing, the canal is no longer navigable. The people of Asia and Europe will have to pay a heavy price for this.

　　Sobolev said that some people are trying to submerge the substantive issue of stopping aggression in general issues. He said that the Soviet delegation demanded that Britain and France be condemned, and the United Nations General Assembly should consider other measures to stop the aggression.

　　The Indonesian representative requested that the Asian-African countries' proposal be adopted. He said that the Canadian proposal might be useful, but it was currently "unclear". The U.S. proposal did not mention the issue of a ceasefire and taking emergency measures.

　　At the suggestion of the Danish representative, the meeting voted on the Asian-African countries' proposal and the Canadian proposal.

　　The result of the vote was: The Canadian proposal was adopted with fifty-seven votes in favor, nineteen abstentions, and no votes against. The countries abstaining included Britain, France, Israel, Egypt, and the Soviet Union.

　　Then, the General Assembly adopted the Asian-African countries' proposal with fifty-nine votes in favor, five votes against, and twelve abstentions. The countries voting against were Britain, France, Israel, Australia, and New Zealand.

  　联合国大会通过亚非国家的提案
    再斥英法侵略埃及并限期按联大决议停火
    同时通过加拿大关于组织“联合国警察部队”的提案
    新华社4日讯　纽约消息：联合国大会11月3日应埃及代表的请求再次举行紧急会议，讨论英、法、以三国侵略埃及的问题。会议通过了亚非国家的提案和加拿大的提案。
    埃及代表卢特菲首先发言。他说，联合国必须采取步骤来结束侵略和恢复和平。埃及是一个爱好和平的国家，可是它却受到了两个大国的横暴的武装进攻。他说，“埃及在保卫自己，并且将继续保卫自己。局势正在恶化。加剧战争的威胁不断存在着。全世界人民把希望寄托在你们身上，请不要使他们失望。”
    美国代表洛奇提出两个提案。一个是关于苏伊士问题的提案，一个是巴勒斯坦问题的提案。
    美国关于苏伊士问题的提案主张设立一个由若干国家组成的委员会来负责：（一）采取措施立即重开苏伊士运河作为一条可靠国际水道的。（二）在同埃及、法国和英国磋商下准备一项管理和保养苏伊士运河以及运河的自由航行的计划，这项计划要符合1888年公约和安全理事会以前通过的关于解决苏伊士问题的六项原则。（三）采纳和实施上述计划。提案还规定这个委员会在适当的时候向大会和安全理事会提出报告，并且邀请委员会提出它认为有益的建议来促进一种同联合国的目的和原则相一致的公正而永久的解决苏伊士问题的办法。联合国会员国给予委员会以一切适当的协助。
    关于巴勒斯坦问题的提案主张根据1948年12月11日的联合国大会的决议而建立的巴勒斯坦调解委员会停止执行任务，而成立一个由五个委员组成的委员会。这个委员会将：（一）在同1949年总停战协定上签字的各方磋商后，准备关于解决阿拉伯国家和以色列之间悬而未决的巨大问题的建议，而以在这个地区建立永久和平和稳定的情况为目的。（二）把委员会的建议提交有关各方并且提交大会，或者是在适当的情况下提交安全理事会，并且向大会提出关于委员会受托的工作的情况报告。提案还要求秘书长在跟委员会合作下继续向各方斡旋；要求联合国会员国给予委员会一切适当的帮助。
    伊拉克代表贾瓦特说：大会的重要职责是制止侵略者和维护它的权力。这里的每一个人都认识到三个国家拒绝服从大会的决议的危险。没有依照决议而停火的这一事实明显地表明上述国家是不尊重联合国的权力或者国际法的。这就是暴力，它们现在正在通过它们的陆、海、空军来应用暴力。纳粹和法西斯分子从来就没有承认过国际联盟的权力。同纳粹和法西斯分子比起来，这些国家如何呢？同纳粹所做的一样，它们想把时代向后拉。
    贾瓦特说：在我们希望这个组织的会员国会起来对侵略者的蔑视态度表示反对时，我们发现一切姑息因素都汇集在两个美国提案中了。
    印度代表拉尔再次谴责英法的侵略行动，并且代表十九个亚非国家提出一项提案，这个提案说：“大会，
    “遗憾地注意到并不是所有有关方面已经同意履行它在1956年11月2日通过的决议的条款，注意到这个决议特别优先考虑立即停火，特别优先考虑制止把军事部队和武器运入这个地区作为停火的一部分，“进一步注意到这个决议要求签订停战协定的各方立即把所有部队撤到停战线后面，停止通过停战线侵入邻近的领土，并且彻底遵守停战协定的条款，
    “一、重申大会1956年11月2日的决议，并且再一次要求各方立即同意上项决议的条款；
    “二、授权秘书长立即同有关各方安排实行停火和制止把军队和军火运进这个地区，并且要求他立即，或是无论如何不迟于通过本决议之时起的十二小时内提出赞同的报告。
    “三、要求秘书长在联合国停战监察组织首长和工作人员的协助下促使实现一切部队撤回到停战线后面。
    “四、决定在收到秘书长提出的本决议实质性的第二段提到的报告时马上再度举行会议。”
    加拿大代表皮尔逊接着发言，他提出了一项新的提案，这个提案主张组织一支所谓驻在中东的“联合国警察部队”。提案说：
    “大会，
    “鉴于迫切需要促使实现11月2日的决议……
    “要求秘书长作为一个优先处理的问题在四十八小时内向大会提出一项在有关国家同意下的组成一支联合国国际紧急部队的计划，这支部队的任务是根据上项决议的条款保证和监督敌对行动的停止。”
    美国代表洛奇对加拿大提案马上表示支持。他说，他“非常欢喜”这个提案，并且不打算坚持要表决美国的提案。
    苏联代表索波列夫发言说，英法两国不但已经拒绝接受联合国大会的决议，而且还蹂躏这个决议。英法两国已经对国际的良知和道义提出了挑战。
    索波列夫说，在英法进攻埃及以前，苏伊士运河是畅通无阻的。而现在，由于英法的轰炸，运河已经不能通航。欧亚两洲的人民对此将不得不付出重大的代价。
    索波列夫说，有人正在企图把制止侵略这个实质问题淹没在一般的问题中。他说，苏联代表团要求谴责英法，联合国大会应该考虑其他措施来制止侵略。
    印度尼西亚代表要求通过亚非国家的提案。他说，加拿大的提案可能是有用的，但是目前却是“不清楚”的。美国的提案却没有提到停火和采取紧急措施的问题。
    在丹麦代表的建议下，会议就亚非国家的提案和加拿大的提案进行表决。
    表决结果是：加拿大提案以五十七票赞成，十九票弃权和没有人反对的情况下获得通过。弃权的国家包括英国、法国、以色列、埃及和苏联等国。　　接着，大会以五十九票赞成，五票反对和十二票弃权通过了亚非国家的提案。投反对票的是英、法、以色列、澳大利亚和新西兰。
