Fellow gentlemen, fellow comrades:

I am now going to report to you my recollections of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's life and my personal thoughts.

Mr. Sun Yat-sen was born in 1866 in Cuiheng Village, Zhongshan County, Guangdong Province. After growing up, he studied medicine in Guangzhou, Hong Kong, and other places, and then aspired to overthrow the Qing Dynasty and establish a republic, often advocating revolution in his spare time. In 1894, Mr. Sun Yat-sen founded the Xingzhonghui in Honolulu. In 1903, he began preparing to organize the Tongmenghui in Japan, contacting revolutionary intellectuals and overseas Chinese at home and abroad, promoting revolution, and leading multiple uprisings to overthrow the Qing Dynasty. The Xinhai Revolution broke out, the Qing imperial family collapsed, and the Republic of China was established, but the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal revolutionary goals were not achieved, and China remained a semi-colonial and semi-feudal country. After Yuan Shikai seized power with the support of imperialism, Mr. Sun Yat-sen reorganized the Chinese Revolutionary Party in Japan to carry out the struggle against imperialism, Yuan Shikai, and the warlords. The glorious victory of the Soviet October Revolution was a great encouragement to Mr. Sun Yat-sen. From then on, Mr. Sun Yat-sen and the revolutionary democrats he led began contact with the Soviet Union. In 1924, Mr. Sun Yat-sen decided to learn from the Soviet Union, formulating the three major policies of alliance with the Soviet Union, alliance with the Communist Party, and assistance to farmers and workers, reorganizing the Kuomintang at that time, and the First Great Revolution began. In November 1924, Mr. Sun Yat-sen came to the north alone in order to awaken the people and promote national public opinion. On March 12, 1925, he died of liver cancer in Beijing.

Judging from Mr. Sun Yat-sen's life deeds, what was the dominant ideology that ran through his life's actions? I think:

First, Mr. Sun Yat-sen's firm opposition to imperialism

Mr. Sun Yat-sen grew up in China after the Opium War, after the "opening of ports" and "five ports of trade," living in an environment of imperialist political aggression and economic oppression. From his first trip to England, he traveled across the ocean several times, visiting colonial and dependent countries in Asia and Africa, and personally witnessed the vulnerability of imperialism itself and the corruption and contradictions of the capitalist system. In the early days of his revolutionary propaganda work, he was obstructed and hindered by the imperialist government authorities in many ways, or unreasonably deported; or refused to disembark; or simply arrested and prepared to be escorted back to China to be handed over to the Qing government. In such a harsh environment, Mr. Sun Yat-sen still promoted and advocated revolution everywhere. Later, after the Qing Dynasty fell and the Republic of China was established, after Yuan Shikai collapsed, various warlords relied on the great powers to divide and occupy territories, splitting China, forming the so-called spheres of influence of imperialism, which further strengthened Mr. Sun Yat-sen's determination to oppose imperialism. When Mr. Sun Yat-sen established a revolutionary government in Guangdong, he more clearly and prominently took firm opposition to imperialism as the central program. In every revolutionary struggle, Mr. Sun Yat-sen resisted the persecution and obstruction of imperialism and never yielded. Because he understood that in the semi-colonial and semi-feudal society of China at that time, if it was to truly become a free, equal, independent and strong country, it must overthrow the power of imperialism in China; without doing so, the Chinese revolution could not succeed. Mr. Sun Yat-sen is respected and admired not only by the Chinese people, but also by the people of Asian and African countries, because he can resolutely and uncompromisingly fight against imperialism.

Second, to oppose imperialism, it is necessary to mobilize the people and rely on the people.

Mr. Sun Yat-sen proved from his half-life of revolutionary experience that in the old China, which was semi-colonial and semi-feudal, to oppose imperialism and carry out revolution, it was necessary to grasp arms, carry out uprisings, and try to win people's hearts and gain more people's sympathy. Mr. Sun Yat-sen also knew that even if he grasped arms and gained more people's sympathy, if he left the people, the revolution might fail, and the revolution would never succeed. Who are the people? They are workers and farmers. In Mr. Sun Yat-sen's own words: "Workers and farmers account for the vast majority of the population in China and are the largest class in China. Their position and the suffering they feel are largely the same; the desire to oppose imperialism and the desire for liberation are also equally urgent. If our revolutionary government can raise the awareness of workers and peasants, jointly resist imperialism and warlords, resist special classes that are unfavorable to China, and seek the liberation of workers and peasants, then workers and peasants will naturally rise up to support the government and act in unison with the government, our foundation can be consolidated, our revolution can succeed, and it can be thorough." Therefore, Mr. Sun Yat-sen advocated assistance to workers and peasants as the central policy. Since Mr. Sun Yat-sen advocated assistance to the workers' and peasants' movement and advocated the people's movement as the basis of the revolution, he would inevitably unite with the Chinese proletariat party—the Chinese Communist Party—at home; at the same time, he would also unite with the international forces that opposed imperialism and colonialism abroad. The central idea of ​​alliance with Russia, alliance with the Communist Party, and assistance to farmers and workers is to "take Russia as a teacher," respect Lenin as "a good friend and teacher of the country," openly say that "the Chinese revolution must take the road of Russia," and tell the backward elements who opposed the reorganization of the Kuomintang: "You oppose my three major policies: you can withdraw from the Kuomintang." Mr. Sun Yat-sen consistently advocated: to carry out an unremitting struggle against imperialism, we should unite with the oppressed nations of the world and fight together. Mr. Sun Yat-sen originally intended to clearly mention this point in his will. However, it was later modified by Wang Jingwei, who took notes of the will. Thirty-one years later, today, when we turn over these histories, we can know how wise and correct Mr. Sun Yat-sen was in estimating the development of the revolutionary situation at that time, setting the revolutionary plan, and how worthy it is for us, the younger generations who followed Mr. Zhongshan, to study deeply.

Third, two ways to solve people's livelihood problems—regulation of capital and equalization of land ownership.

Eliminating imperialist forces, implementing the three major policies, and promoting the regulation of capital and equalization of land ownership were a series of revolutionary steps taken by Mr. Sun Yat-sen at that time. Regarding the regulation of capital, Mr. Sun Yat-sen clearly pointed out in the declaration of the First National Congress of the Chinese Kuomintang he drafted: "If the scale of enterprises is too large to be handled by private forces, such as banks, railways, and sea routes, they shall be operated and managed by the state, so that the private capital system cannot manipulate the people's livelihood." It can be seen that Mr. Sun Yat-sen's advocacy of regulating capital at that time was roughly in line with our current policy of restricting capitalism. As for the main content of equalization of land ownership, it is that those who till the land should own it. Equalization of land ownership and those who till the land owning it are inseparable. However, even when slogans such as "equalization of land ownership" and "regulation of capital" were put forward at that time, right-wing figures in the Kuomintang also fiercely opposed them. However, their opposition did not shake Mr. Sun Yat-sen's determination. Mr. Sun Yat-sen still firmly regarded equalization of land ownership and regulation of capital as the way to solve China's social problems.

Fourth, the grand plan for the construction of China—National Reconstruction, Fundamentals of National Reconstruction.

Mr. Sun Yat-sen's program of overthrowing imperialism, relying on workers and peasants, allying with the Communist Party, allying with Russia, regulating capital, and equalizing land ownership is also a fairly thorough program of democratic revolution. In the spirit of this program, his writings, National Reconstruction and Fundamentals of National Reconstruction, depicted the vision of China's construction. According to the construction blueprint drawn by Mr. Sun Yat-sen for our country, the plans for building roads, mining, building ports, controlling rivers, etc., still have considerable reference value today. Naturally, under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong, the Chinese Communist Party, and the People's Government, our country's socialist construction has far exceeded the scale that all predecessors could have imagined, and some of them have even been overfulfilled. We now have our own manufactured cars, tractors, ships, and airplanes, and we will further conduct scientific research on the peaceful use of atomic energy and electronics. We are developing rapidly, and in three to five years, our society will be even more prosperous and strong.

Mr. Sun Yat-sen was definitely not a simple nationalist. He gave many speeches opposing the practice of severing the Three Principles of the People and only talking about nationalism; he also often criticized the old Tongmenghui members and old Kuomintang members' simple anti-Qing thinking. If we commemorate Mr. Sun Yat-sen today and set aside the above, then we cannot truly understand Mr. Sun Yat-sen. After 1927, the stubborn and backward Kuomintang members who opposed the reorganization of the Kuomintang and deviated from Mr. Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary propositions and revolutionary programs once attempted to castrate this glorious revolutionary part of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's thought. During the Chiang Kai-shek rule, the National History Museum, presided over by Hu Yisheng, Zou Lu, and others, ran counter to Mr. Sun Yat-sen's firm opposition to imperialism, the implementation of the three major policies of alliance with Russia, alliance with the Communist Party, and assistance to farmers and workers, and the ideal of achieving the regulation of capital and equalization of land ownership to build a prosperous and strong China. The history they wrote mostly deleted the deeds of Mr. Sun Yat-sen during this period. For many years, the brilliance of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's true thought has been obscured for a long time, so that many people do not know it very clearly. However, Mr. Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary ideals, Mr. Sun Yat-sen's democratic revolutionary thoughts and actions, have now been carried forward and completely and transcendently realized by the Chinese Communist Party. It is not difficult to understand that Mr. Sun Yat-sen's thought has also had a profound influence on countries that are engaged in fierce struggles against imperialism and colonialism.

What should we learn from this great democratic revolutionist when we commemorate Mr. Sun Yat-sen today?

I think, first of all, we should learn from his simple and honest life. Mr. Sun Yat-sen was honest and lived a simple life. From the time I met him, in the more than twenty years we spent together, although he did so many things for the revolution and the country, the people gave him such high honor and respected him so much, his simple life was as it always was. When he was running around for the revolution, his life was very hard. He was not only very honest himself, but also required other comrades who worked with him to be like him. After his death, he had no inheritance except for a small bungalow built with donations from overseas Chinese and handwritten manuscripts. He did not celebrate birthdays and hated the offerings of food in front of him. This is worthy of our remembrance, admiration, and learning.

Secondly, we should learn from his diligent study and continuous progress. Mr. Sun Yat-sen loved to study very much. Although he was busy with official duties, he always had a book in his hand when he was free. Mr. Sun Yat-sen also required himself to keep up with the progressive thinking of the world. He often read many new books and studied maps, so that his thinking could adapt to the development of the world trend at any time. From the perspective of the development of his thought, he has been constantly progressing from enriching the country and strengthening the army to establishing democracy, regulating capital, equalizing land ownership, opposing imperialism, and then developing to the three major policies and taking Russia as a teacher.

From Mr. Sun Yat-sen's birth to today, it has just been ninety years. If Mr. Zhongshan began to aspire to revolution at the age of twenty, then, after seventy years, and countless failures, setbacks, bloodshed, twists and turns, 600 million Chinese people finally rose up and, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, inherited all of his thoughts and fully realized them. If Mr. Zhongshan knew this in his death, he would definitely be very comforted. Many of the people in the audience are members of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang and various democratic parties, non-party democratic people, who had historical ties with Mr. Sun Yat-sen in the past. We who died later are very comforted and grateful for Chairman Mao's wise leadership to have witnessed today. Mr. Sun Yat-sen is worthy of our eternal commemoration, but the changes in the Chinese revolution over the past ninety years are even more worthy of our eternal recollection and contemplation, drawing out experience to continuously leave to our children and grandchildren as a reference, and also to provide our Asian and African brother countries as a reference. Mr. Sun Yat-sen's road is glorious and full of struggle. However, to resolutely complete this road requires a strong will, a spirit of never yielding to imperialism, an attitude of continuous learning, and a strong belief in relying on the workers and peasants. Mr. Sun Yat-sen passed away thirty-one years ago, but the Chinese people finally realized Mr. Sun Yat-sen's democratic revolutionary proposition under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party.

I am eighty years old, and I was fortunate enough to be a small soldier of Mr. Sun Yat-sen fifty-five years ago, and today I am fortunate enough to be a small soldier of Mao Zedong. Not only have I seen with my own eyes that all of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's ideals have been realized, but I also firmly believe that I will see socialism fully realized in China. Moreover, my vitality requires me to see communism fully realized in China.

The revolution is continuing to move forward. We commemorate our predecessors and celebrate our victory, and at the same time, we spur ourselves to move forward to a greater, deeper, more glorious victory, following in the footsteps of our predecessors!

### 中国国民党革命委员会副主席  何香凝的讲话

专栏：

    中国国民党革命委员会副主席
    何香凝的讲话各位先生、各位同志：
    我现在向各位报告我对孙中山先生生平的回忆和我个人的感想。
    孙中山先生在1866年诞生于广东省中山县翠亨村。长大之后，在广州、香港等地学医，便有志于推翻清廷，创建民国，常常在课余鼓吹革命。1894年，孙中山先生在檀香山创立兴中会，1903年在日本开始筹备组织同盟会，联络国内外革命知识青年及华侨，宣传革命，领导多次的起义，以推翻清朝。辛亥革命爆发，清朝皇室崩溃，民国成立，但反帝反封建的革命目的，并没有完成，中国依然是半殖民地半封建的国家。袁世凯在帝国主义支持下窃取政权以后，孙中山先生在日本另组中华革命党，进行反帝国主义，反袁世凯，反军阀的斗争。苏联十月革命的辉煌胜利，对孙中山先生是很大的鼓舞。从此以后，孙中山先生和他领导下的革命民主派，即开始了和苏联方面的接触。1924年孙中山先生决定以苏联为师，学习苏联，制定联苏，联共，扶助工农的三大政策，改组当时的国民党，第一次大革命开始了。1924年11月，孙中山先生为要唤起民众，推动全国舆论，就单身来到北方。1925年3月12日因肝癌不治，在北京病逝。
    从孙中山先生的生平事迹来看，贯彻在他一生行动中的主导思想是什么呢？我认为：
    第一，是中山先生的坚决反对帝国主义
    孙中山先生生长于鸦片战争后“门户开放”“五口通商”后的中国，生活在帝国主义的政治侵略和经济压迫的环境中。从他第一次游英国开始，几度远涉重洋，周游亚非等殖民地附属国，亲眼看到了帝国主义本身的脆弱及资本主义制度的腐朽和矛盾。他在早期做宣传革命工作之时，曾被帝国主义政府当局多方面阻挠和妨碍，或则无理驱逐出境；或则拒绝登岸；或则干脆加以逮捕，预备押解回国交与清政府。就在这样恶劣的环境中，孙中山先生仍然到处宣传、鼓吹革命。后来清朝既倒，民国成立，袁世凯崩溃以后，各个军阀依附列强割据地方，分裂中国，形成了帝国主义的所谓势力范围，这就更益增强了孙中山先生反对帝国主义的决心。及至孙中山先生在广东建立革命政府，就更明确而突出地以坚决反对帝国主义作为中心纲领。孙中山先生在每次革命斗争中，对帝国主义的迫害妨碍，都竭力反抗，从不屈服。因为他明白，当时在半殖民地半封建社会的中国，如果要真正成为自由平等和独立富强的国家，一定要推翻帝国主义在中国的势力，不这样做，中国革命就不能成功。孙中山先生不仅为中国人民，并且为亚非各国人民所尊敬景仰，就是他能够坚决而不妥协地向帝国主义作斗争。
    第二，反对帝国主义必须动员民众，依靠民众。
    孙中山先生从他半生革命的经验证明，知道在半殖民地半封建的旧中国，要反对帝国主义，进行革命，一定要掌握武装，进行起义，和尽量争取人心，取得更多人的同情。孙中山先生也知道，即使掌握了武装，取得更多人的同情，但是如果一旦离开了民众的话，那么革命恐会失败，革命也断无成就。民众是谁呢？就是工人和农民。用孙中山先生自己的话来说：“工人和农民在中国占人口的绝大多数，是中国最大的阶级。他们所处的地位和所感受的痛苦，大抵相同；要求反帝国主义，要求解放的心情，也同样迫切。我们的革命政府如果能够提高工农的觉悟，共同反抗帝国主义及军阀，反抗不利于中国的特殊阶级，谋求工农的解放，这样工农自然会起来拥护政府，和政府一致行动，我们的基础便可巩固，我们的革命便可成功，便可彻底。”所以孙中山先生高揭扶助工农作为中心政策。孙中山先生既然主张扶助工农运动，主张以民众运动作为革命基础，就必然地要在国内联合中国无产阶级的政党——中国共产党；同时，在国外也要联合反对帝国主义，反对殖民主义的国际力量。而联俄，联共和扶助农工的中心思想，就是“以俄为师”，尊崇列宁为“国友人师”，公开说“中国革命一定要走俄国的道路”，并对反对国民党改组的落后分子说：“你们反对我的三大政策：你们可以退出国民党”。孙中山先生一贯主张：和帝国主义作不懈的斗争，应当联合世界上被压迫民族，共同奋斗。孙中山先生本意想在遗嘱中明确提到这一点的。但是后来被笔记遗嘱的汪精卫所修改了。在三十一年后的，今天，我们翻开这些历史，就可知孙中山先生在当时估计革命形势发展，手定革命大计，是如何的英明正确，是如何地值得我们追随中山先生的后死之辈深刻学习。
    第三，解决民生问题的两个办法——节制资本和平均地权。
    肃清帝国主义势力，贯彻三大政策，推行节制资本和平均地权，是孙中山先生当时的一系列革命步骤。关于节制资本，孙中山先生在他手定的中国国民党第一次全国代表大会宣言里明白指出：企业中“规模过大。为私人之力所不能办者。如银行铁路航路之属。由国家经营管理之。使私有资本制度不能操纵国民之生计。”可见当时孙中山先生节制资本的主张，实际上与我们今日限制资本主义的政策是大致符合的。至于平均地权的主要内容，就是耕者有其田。平均地权与耕者有其田是不可分离的。可是，那时候就是提出了“平均地权”，“节制资本”这样的口号，国民党内右派人士也加以激烈反对。不过他们的反对并没有动摇孙中山先生的决心，孙中山先生仍然坚决地以平均地权，节制资本作为解决中国社会问题的途径。
    第四，建设中国的远大计划——建国方略，建国大纲。
    孙中山先生的推翻帝国主义，倚靠工农，联共，联俄，节制资本，平均地权的纲领，也即是相当彻底的民主主义革命的纲领。在这纲领的精神上，他所著建国方略和建国大纲，描绘了中国建设的远景。按照孙中山先生为我们国家所拟的建设草图，修筑公路，开矿，建港，治河等等计划，及今犹有相当的参考价值。自然，现在我国在毛泽东主席，中国共产党和人民政府的领导下，社会主义建设已远远超过了所有前人所能想像的规模，其中甚至有些已经超额完成了。我们目前已经有了自己制造的汽车、拖拉机、轮船和飞机，我们还要进一步进行和平利用原子和电子的科学研究。我们正一日千里地向前发展，三、五年后，我们的社会一定会更加繁荣富强的。
    孙中山先生绝对不是单纯的民族主义者。他曾多次演讲，反对割裂三民主义，单讲民族主义的做法；也常常批判老同盟会员和老国民党人的单纯反清思想。我们今天纪念孙中山先生，如果撇开以上这些，那我们就不能真正了解孙中山先生了。1927年以后，反对改组国民党、离开了孙中山先生的革命主张和革命纲领的、顽固落后的国民党人，曾经企图阉割孙中山先生思想的这一光辉的革命部分。在蒋介石统治时期，胡毅生，邹鲁等人主持的国史馆，对孙中山先生坚决反对帝国主义，执行联俄、联共、扶助农工三大政策，和实现节制资本、平均地权建设繁荣富强的中国的理想，都是背道而驰的。他们所编写的历史，大都删略了孙中山先生这一个时期的事迹。很多年来，孙中山先生的真正思想的光辉，就这样长时期被人抹杀，以至很多人都知道得不十分清楚。然而孙中山先生的革命理想，孙中山先生的民主主义革命的思想和行动，今日已为中国共产党所发扬光大，而完整地，超越地被实现了。对正在进行反帝国主义，反殖民主义的激烈斗争的国家，孙中山先生的思想也发生了深远的影响，这是不难理解的。
    我们今天纪念孙中山先生，应当向这位伟大的民主主义革命家学习些什么呢？
    我认为，首先，是学习他简朴清廉的生活。孙中山先生一生清廉，生活简朴。从我认识他的时候开始，在相处二十多年的日子里，虽然他为革命为国家做了那么多的事，人民付与他那么高的荣誉和对他那样尊敬，他的生活的简朴都一如往日。他奔走革命之时，生活十分刻苦，他不但自己十分清廉，而且要求其他和他共事的同志也和他一样。他死后除了一所由华侨捐资筑成的小洋房和手稿遗著而外，没有任何遗产。他不做生日，讨厌食前方丈的供奉。这是值得我们追思景仰和学习的。
    其次，是学习他刻苦钻研，不断求进步的学习精神。孙中山先生很爱学习。虽然他公务繁忙，但是有空总是手不释卷。孙中山先生还要求他自己经常能够跟上世界的进步思想。他常常看很多新书及研究地图，使自己的思想随时适应世界潮流的发展。从他的思想发展上看，他由富国强兵，到建立民主，节制资本，平均地权，反对帝国主义，再发展到三大政策，以俄为师，他是不断进步的。
    由孙中山先生诞生到今日，刚刚是九十年。如果中山先生由二十岁开始有志于革命，那么，经过了七十年的时间，和无数的失败，挫折，流血，曲折，六万万中国人民终于起来，在中国共产党的领导下，将他的思想全部继承了下来，并使全部得到了实现。中山先生死而有知，一定是很安慰的。座中有很多民革和各民主党派，无党无派民主人士，过去都与孙中山先生有过历史因缘，我们后死者得亲眼见有今日，也万分安慰，万分感谢毛主席的英明领导。孙中山先生值得我们永远的纪念，但九十年来中国革命的变化，更值得我们永远追忆，加以思索，引出经验，来不断留给我们的子孙作为参考，而且也可以供给我们亚非的弟兄国家作为参考。孙中山的道路，是光荣的，战斗的。但坚决走完这段路需要坚强的意志，向帝国主义永不屈服的精神，不断学习的态度，和依靠工农群众的坚强信念。三十一年前孙中山先生逝世了，但是，中国人民终于在中国共产党的领导之下实现了孙中山先生的民主主义的革命主张。
    我行年八十，五十五年前侥幸得为孙中山的一个小兵，今日又侥幸得成为毛泽东的一个小兵。我不但用自己的眼睛看到孙中山先生的理想全部得到实现，我也坚信我也会看到社会主义在中国得到全部实现。并且，我的生命力，要求看到共产主义在中国得到全部实现。
    革命是继续前进的。我们纪念我们的先行者，庆祝我们的胜利，同时也为着向更大更深远更光荣的胜利鞭策我们自己，踏着我们先行者的足迹前进！
