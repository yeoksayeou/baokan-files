    Let Members Increase Income
    By our reporter Xiang Cun
    Linqing City is the economic center of more than twenty counties in northwestern Shandong (including Weixian and Quxian in Hebei Province), and is known as "Little Tianjin." The city's handicraft production is very developed. Almost every household in Zhugan Lane and Gutong Lane is engaged in bamboo and wood handicraft production. Famous products such as Qianzhang jackets (leather jackets sewn from more than two thousand scraps of waste sheepskin), leather shafts, "Bi Jia" top knives (for cotton gins), "Sun Jia" butcher knives, iron shovels, and hada specially for gifts to minority areas have always been popular far and wide.
    Since the city achieved cooperation in January this year, handicraft production has been flourishing. In the past, the phenomenon of "being at a loss on what to do" has disappeared. The enthusiasm of the members is high, the relationship between production and sales is closer, and the types of products are increasing day by day. Product quality has been greatly improved, and labor productivity has increased by 25%. From January to October, the total output value of each cooperative increased by 48% compared with the same period last year. In September, 92.26% of the members had increased their income. The iron furnace, leather shaft, Third Clothing, silk thread, silk weaving, food, craft repair, and measurement industries, all of the eight production cooperatives, have 100% increased their incomes. Now the average wage of the city's members has reached 33.94 yuan per person per month.
    The main reason why Linqing City can achieve income increases for more than 92% of its members is that it proceeds from the actual situation, pays attention to developing production, and the products meet social needs.
    In the early stage of realizing cooperation, many cooperatives once neglected the inherent characteristics of handicrafts, concentrated too much, resulting in low production enthusiasm of the members, and did not care about the sales of their products. Since the Linqing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Handicraft Federation leaders often went deep into the masses, kept in touch with reality, and promptly understood the urgent needs of the members, they began to adjust the organization in April. According to the principle of being conducive to production, restoring close contact with the peasants, several production organizational forms were adopted according to the different circumstances of each cooperative. Such as centralized production and decentralized production with unified accounting of profits and losses; production that is both centralized and decentralized, with accounting of profits and losses by groups; and decentralized production with complete self-responsibility for profits and losses. After reasonable organizational adjustment, the production enthusiasm of the members soared. The cooperatives seized the opportunity to vigorously organize production and launched an advanced producer movement, so the output value has increased to varying degrees. The iron furnace production cooperative increased the variety of products by 50% compared with before cooperation, and the output value increased by more than 80% compared with the same period last year.
    On the premise of developing production, there are still many production cooperatives that cannot guarantee income increases for more than 90% of their members due to insufficient raw materials and the "family shop" nature being too large. In order to ensure income increases for more than 90% of the members, the leading comrades of the Municipal Party Committee personally went deep into the bamboo ware, Third Clothing, iron furnace, and other production cooperatives to investigate the lives of the members, understand the production and distribution situation, and especially clarified and solved the reasonable ratio of wage expenditure and public accumulation of the members, which also ensured that these members increased their incomes.
    Another important measure to ensure income increases for more than 90% of the members is to resolutely implement the policy of running cooperatives diligently and frugally. Due to the large size of the cooperatives after cooperation, plus the lack of production management experience, there are more management personnel, and management costs have also increased accordingly. For example, in the Third Clothing and other three cooperatives, management personnel accounted for 11%, and management costs accounted for about 7% of the operating income. In order to increase the number of production personnel and develop production as much as possible, the cooperatives have reduced administrative management personnel to about 7%. When implementing various measures to implement running cooperatives diligently and frugally, such as reducing management personnel and implementing piece-rate wage system, the cooperatives organized members to discuss, promote democracy, and establish the idea of members "taking the cooperative as their home." After all the members of the iron furnace cooperative understood the correct relationship between ensuring attendance rate and the cooperative and themselves, they encouraged and supervised each other. In September, the attendance rate of the entire cooperative unprecedentedly reached 97.8%, thus powerfully ensuring that 100% of the members increased their incomes.

    让社员增加收入
    本报记者　向村
    临清市是山东西北部二十多个县（包括河北省威县、曲周等）的经济中心，素有“小天津”之称。全市手工业生产很发达，竹竿巷、箍桶巷等，几乎家家都是竹、木器手工业户。著名产品如千张袄（用二千多块零碎的废羊皮毛缝成的皮袄）、皮轴、“毕家”上刀（轧花车用）、“孙家”屠刀、铁锨和专供少数民族地区献礼用的哈达等，一向畅销远近各地。
    今年1月全市实现合作化以来，手工业生产欣欣向荣，过去“鞍肽晟??肽晗小钡南窒竺挥辛恕Ｈ?卸??烁鍪止ひ瞪??献魃绲牟?罚?分直群献骰?郧霸黾恿私??种?唬?柿恳财毡橛辛讼灾?岣摺Ｈ绾细衤势骄?岣吡?5％。1至10月份，各社生产总值比去年同期增长48％。9月份，已有92.26％的社员增加了收入。铁炉、皮轴、第三服装、丝线、丝织、食品、工艺修理、度量衡等八个生产社，都百分之百的增加收入。现在全市社员的平均工资每人每月已达到三十三点九四元。
    临清市能够做到92％以上社员增加了收入，主要原因是从实际情况出发，注意发展生产，产品适应社会需要。
    在实现合作化的初期，许多社曾一度忽视手工业的固有特点，过于集中，造成社员生产情绪不高，不关心自己的产品销售。由于中共临清市委和手工业联合社的领导经常深入群众，联系实际，及时了解社员的迫切要求，从4月开始调整组织，根据有利生产，恢复和农民密切联系的原则，按各社的不同情况，采取了几种因地制宜的生产组织形式。如统一计算盈亏的集中生产和分散生产；以小组为单位计算盈亏的又集中又分散的生产；和完全自负盈亏的分散生产。经过合理调整组织后，社员的生产积极性高涨了。各社抓紧时机，大力组织生产，开展先进生产者运动，因而产值都有了不同程度的增长。铁炉生产社产品种类比合作化前增加了50％，产值比去年同期提高80％以上。
    在发展生产的前提下，也还有不少生产社，因原料不足和“连家铺”性质较大等等，仍不能保证90％以上社员增加工资收入。为了保证90％以上社员增加收入，市委领导同志亲自深入竹器、第三服装、铁炉等生产社，调查社员生活，了解生产和分配的情况，特别摸清和解决了社员工资支出和公共积累的合理比例，也保证这些社员增加了收入。
    保证90％以上社员增加收入的另一重要措施，就是坚决贯彻了勤俭办社的方针。由于合作化后社大、摊子大，加上缺乏生产管理经验，管理人员较多，管理费用也相应增加。如第三服装等三个社，管理人员占11％，管理费用占经营额的7％左右。为了尽量增多生产人员，发展生产，各社已把行政管理人员缩减到7％左右。在贯彻勤俭办社所采取的各种措施，如减少管理人员和实行计件工资制等的时候，各社都组织社员讨论，发扬民主，树立社员“以社为家”的思想。铁炉社全体社员懂得了保证出勤率对社、对自己的正确关系以后，互相鼓励和督促，9月份全社出勤率竟空前地达到97.8％，因而有力地保证了百分之百社员增加了收入。
