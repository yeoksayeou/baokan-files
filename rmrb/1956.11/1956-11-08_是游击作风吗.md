Is it Guerrilla Tactics?
    Xiao Liu was scraping ink off a mimeograph stencil that had already been printed. Section Chief Zhang asked, "What are you scraping it for?"
    Xiao Liu said, "This way, each box of ink can print two to three thousand more copies."
    Section Chief Zhang shook his head and said, "Why bother with such petty guerrilla tactics now?"
    Thrift is a fine tradition we should maintain. Only those who don't know the immensity of heaven and earth would mock it. He Zhongqi

    是游击作风吗
    小刘正在从印过了的腊纸上刮油墨，张股长问：“刮它作什么？”
    小刘说：“这样每盒油墨就可以多印两千到三千份印刷品。”　
    张股长摇摇头说：“现在还何必这样小手小脚的游击作风呢？”
    节约是我们应该保持的优良传统，只有不知天高地厚的人才会加以嘲笑。　何中奇
