Xinhua News Agency, London, November 26th - British Labour Party leader Hugh Gaitskell, speaking at a Labour Party rally in Carlisle on the 25th, demanded the immediate withdrawal of British troops from Egypt.

He said: "Regardless of what some people in Britain and France may think, the vast majority of the rest of the world condemns our invasion of Egypt. They believe that we have no right to be there. In their view, Egypt, which has been attacked by us, is justified in demanding that we must withdraw first before work can begin on clearing the canal."

"We should immediately tell the United Nations that once we are asked to withdraw our troops, we will withdraw without any further conditions. This is the first important step. It is the only way to remove the obstacles."

Gaitskell added: Every day that British troops remain in Egypt prolongs the time that oil rationing is in effect and that industry and employment are threatened.

    盖次克尔要求立即从埃及撤军
    并说埃及要求先撤军后清理运河是正当的
    新华社伦敦26日电　英国工党领袖盖次克尔25日在卡来尔举行的工党群众集会上讲话的时候，要求英国军队立即撤出埃及。
    他说：“不管英国和法国的某些人士可能有什么想法，世界其余部分的绝大多数人都谴责我们侵入埃及。他们认为，我们是没有任何权利呆在那里的。在他们看来，受到我们进攻的埃及要求我们必须先行撤退然后才能着手清理运河是正当的。”
    “我们应当立即对联合国说，一旦要求我们撤退我们的军队，我们将要撤退而不提出任何进一步的条件。这是第一个重要步骤。这是消除障碍的唯一方法。”
    盖次克尔又说：英国的军队在埃及多呆一天，实行石油配给、使工业和就业受到威胁的时间就要延长一天。
