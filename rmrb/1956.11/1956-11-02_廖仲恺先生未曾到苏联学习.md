    Mr. Liao Zhongkai Never Studied in the Soviet Union

    In the article "Mr. Sun Yat-sen's Great Thought and Great Personality" (talk by Mr. Zhou Zhenlin, an old member of the Tongmenghui), published on page 4 of this newspaper on October 24, it was mentioned that "Mr. Sun Yat-sen sent Mr. Liao Zhongkai to study in the Soviet Union," which is not consistent with the facts. According to a letter from Mr. Zhou Zhenlin on November 1st, "This was the original plan, but because Mr. Liao Zhongkai's tasks were extremely heavy at the time, it was not realized. However, at this time, Mr. Sun Yat-sen had repeatedly exchanged letters and telegrams with Lenin, and the relationship became increasingly close. Finally, in 1923, he sent Mr. Liao Zhongkai to Japan to meet with Joffe, and they agreed on the grand plan for Sino-Soviet cooperation."

    廖仲恺先生未曾到苏联学习
    本报10月24日在第四版登的“孙中山先生的伟大思想和伟大人格”（同盟会老会员周震鳞先生的谈话）文中谈到：“中山先生曾派廖仲恺先生到苏联去学习”，与事实不符。据周震鳞先生于11月1日来信称：“这是原来的计议，但因当时廖仲恺先生的任务极其繁重，未能实现。可是此时中山先生已多次与列宁函电往返，联系日益密切，终于1923年派廖仲恺先生到日本和越飞见面，商定了中苏携手的大计。”
