International Notes

    Accomplices
    Agence France-Presse issued a message on November 1 stating that an Israeli official declared that Israel's military action against Egypt had "no cooperative relationship" with Britain and France. On the same day, a British Foreign Office spokesman also cooperated in London, "categorically" denying that the British and French military actions were coordinated with Israel's actions.
    However, this British Foreign Office spokesman, who was ordered to lie, couldn't help but boast about the "victory" of the coordinated actions of Britain, France, and Israel. According to him, Israel is besieging Egyptian troops in the Sinai Peninsula, supposedly because the Egyptian air force has been bombed by Britain and France and is "unable to move."
    The reason why this group of accomplices, colluding to commit arson and robbery, is so self-contradictory is because they want to use coordinated actions to invade Egypt on the one hand, and on the other hand, they want to use coordinated propaganda to prove that there is "no mutual coordination" between them, in an attempt to reduce their guilt of conspiring to undermine world peace in the face of world public opinion. However, regardless of whether they say there is coordination or no coordination, they are all utterly shameless aggressors. They cannot deny this. (Ping)

    同谋犯
    法新社在11月1日发出一条消息说，以色列一个官方人士声明，以色列对埃及的军事行动同英、法“没有合作的关系”。同一天，英国外交部的发言人也配合着在伦敦声明，“断然”否认英法的军事行动同以色列的行动是互相配合的。
    但是，英国外交部这个奉命撒谎的发言人，同时又忍不住想要夸耀一下英、法和以色列配合行动的“胜利”。据他说，以色列正在西奈半岛包围埃及军队，而这据说是因为埃及的空军已被英、法轰炸得“不能出动”了。
    这一伙串通放火打劫的同谋犯之所以弄得如此自相矛盾，是因为他们一方面想用互相配合的行动来侵略埃及，而另一方面又想用互相配合的宣传来证明它们之间“没有互相配合”，以图在世界舆论面前减轻一点它们合谋破坏世界和平的罪责。但是，不管他们说有配合也好，没有配合也好，他们都是无耻透顶的侵略者。这他们可抵赖不掉。　（平）
