Xinhua News Agency, Yangon, November 4th: According to the Mandalay Burmese newspaper "People's Daily" on October 31st, the Head of Kachin State, U Zanhta Sin, stated that there have always been many absurd claims about Chinese aggression, but in fact, no aggression has occurred in any of the areas mentioned in the newspapers.

U Zanhta Sin said that in some areas of the China-Myanmar border, it is difficult to distinguish land ownership. Actions of entering those areas due to a lack of awareness should not be described as aggression.

The State Head said that after Myanmar's independence, due to internal unrest, the Myanmar government had no time to discuss these issues. The State government also had no right to handle the issue, so the problem was left unresolved. He said that it wasn't until 1953, after the State government was established, that a committee composed of representatives from the State's Ministry of Home Affairs and Ministry of Defense inspected the border markers and submitted a report, and reports from some areas were not received until 1954-1955.

U Zanhta Sin said: "During our inspection, we passed through Makong Gam within our territory and reached areas such as Bang Dan (transliteration). Bang Dan is the location of a district government within China. We saw no conflict incidents along the way."

He said that through peaceful negotiations, Chinese troops who had entered Kachin State in Myanmar due to a lack of awareness had already withdrawn.

    缅甸克钦邦邦长驳斥关于我国“侵略”的谎言
    他说沿边境视察结果没有看到冲突事件
    新华社仰光4日电　据曼德勒的缅甸报纸“人民报”10月31日报道克钦邦邦长吴赞塔信发表谈话说，一向有许多关于中国进行侵略的荒谬言论，但是在事实上，像报上所提到的所有地区都没有发生过侵略。
    吴赞塔信说，在中缅边境地区有些地方很难区分它的土地所有权。不能够把由于不知道情况而进入那些地区的行动说成是侵略。
    这位邦长说，在缅甸独立以后，由于内部的不安，缅甸政府一直没有空闲来讨论这些问题。邦政府也无权处理这个问题，因此问题就一直搁置下来。他说，直到1953年，在邦政府成立以后，由邦的内政部和国防部代表们组成的一个委员会才视察了边境的界标，并且提出了报告，而有些地区的报告到1954—1955年才收到。
    吴赞塔信说：‘在我们视察的时候，我们曾经穿过我们境内的马孔加姆一直达到邦旦（译音）等地区。邦旦是中国境内一个区政府所在地。我们沿途没有看到冲突事件。
    他说，通过和平谈判，由于不知情而进入缅甸克钦邦的中国军队已经撤退了。
