Xinhua News Agency, November 7th, TASS dispatch from Cairo: Cairo newspapers on November 6th published news on the front page with large headlines about the measures taken by the Soviet government to stop the criminal aggression of Britain, France, and Israel against Egypt. The newspapers pointed out that Bulganin's letters to Eden, Mollet, and Ben-Gurion were stern warnings against continuing the aggression.

Xinhua News Agency, November 7th, TASS dispatch from Moscow, November 6th: Syrian Foreign Minister Salah al-Din Bitar telegraphed Soviet Foreign Minister Shepilov, expressing support for the Soviet Union's proposal to use force to stop aggression and restore peace in the Middle East. The telegram stated: "The brave and resolute actions taken by the Soviet Union in resisting the imperialists who are aggressing against the Arab people prove that the Soviet Union is a sincere friend of all peoples and a zealous defender of peace. Therefore, the Soviet Union has restored the prestige of the principles and ideals that form the basis of the United Nations Charter. In our country, everyone has received its initiative with great joy and enthusiasm."
