    How to Change the Phenomenon of Undifferentiated Party, Government, and Commune

    On October 12th, the Jilin Daily published a commentary suggesting that "solving the problem of undifferentiated Party, government, and commune should start at the county level." The commentary stated that in many places, in order to overcome the phenomenon of undifferentiated Party, government, and commune, the practice of Party branch secretaries concurrently holding administrative or agricultural cooperative positions has been reduced, allowing them to focus on the Party's political and ideological work. It advocates that Party, government, and commune organizations should have a clear division of labor, holding more specialized meetings and avoiding all-encompassing meetings. These measures have certain benefits in overcoming the phenomenon of undifferentiated Party, government, and commune; however, they are not a fundamental solution to the problem. The No. 1 Agricultural Production Cooperative of Nongda in Lishu County, in order to correct the phenomenon of undifferentiated Party, government, and commune, once designated a full-time branch secretary, and Party and commune meetings were held separately. On the surface, the scope of work of the Party, government, and commune was clearly defined. In reality, the township held a township People's Congress to discuss autumn harvest preparations; then the branch committee repeated the same process, with most of the committee members being township People's Representatives, which naturally felt tedious. As a result, three out of seven committee members fell asleep. They also held Party member meetings and commune member meetings with the same content and method; of course, those who were both commune members and Party branch committee members had to attend these meetings, and who could guarantee that they wouldn't fall asleep in the meetings again? In this way, what practical significance is there in holding separate Party, government, and commune meetings? Apart from making the attendees suffer more "meeting fatigue," what benefit is there? The result of this approach, which only solves the problem in form, is still an undifferentiated Party, government, and commune.

    The commentary pointed out that the reason for the undifferentiated Party, government, and commune is that the Party's grassroots organizations are unclear about their work responsibilities and do not know what they should do and how to do it. This problem cannot be completely solved by the grassroots organizations themselves; the county Party committee must strengthen specific leadership, help the Party's grassroots organizations to delineate their work boundaries, and make them understand what is the Party's work and how the Party's work should be done. On the basis of improving the ideological understanding of grassroots cadres, establishing practical and feasible systems, and changing the forms that need to be changed, the phenomenon of undifferentiated Party, government, and commune can be truly overcome.

### 如何改变党政社不分的现象

    如何改变党政社不分的现象
    10月12日吉林日报发表了一篇评论，提出“解决党、政、社不分的问题要从县里着手”。评论说，不少地方为了克服党、政、社不分的现象，减去了党支部书记兼任行政或农业社的职务，让他们专心于党的政治思想工作；提倡党、政、社的组织要有明确的分工，多开各种专业会议，不开一揽子会议。这些措施，对克服党政社不分的现象有着一定的好处；但并不是解决问题的根本办法。梨树县农大第一农业生产合作社为了纠正党、政、社不分的现象，曾确定了专职的支部书记，党和社的会议也分开来开。从表面看，党政社的工作范围划得很清。实际上，乡里召开了一次乡人民代表大会，讨论秋收准备工作；接着支委会又照样地重复了一遍，到会的委员大多是乡人民代表，自然也就觉得乏味；结果，七个委员有三个人睡了觉。他们还以同样的内容和方式召开了党员大会、社员大会；当然，这些既是社员又是党的支委也要参加会议了，谁能担保他们不再在会上睡觉呢？这样，党政社分别召开会议有什么实际意义呢？除了叫参加会议的人多受些“会议之苦”以外，有什么益处呢？这种只从形式上解决问题的作法的结果，仍旧是党、政、社不分。
    评论指出，党、政、社不分的原因，是党的基层组织对自己的工作职责不明，不知道自己应该作些什么和怎样去作。这个问题，只靠基层组织本身是不可能完全解决的；县委必须加强具体领导，帮助党的基层组织划清工作界限，使他们知道什么是党的工作，党的工作应当怎样去作。在提高基层干部思想认识的基础上，订立切实可行的制度，改变有必要改变的形式，党、政、社不分的现象才能真正克服。
