Xinhua News Agency, 23rd - This year, China has successfully trial-produced over sixty new varieties of canned goods. Among these new varieties, fifteen have already been mass-produced in large state-owned canneries in Shanghai, Tianjin, Songjiang, and other places; the remaining varieties will also meet consumers soon.

New canned goods successfully trial-produced this year include prawns, peanuts, Chinese herring, and pickled tomatoes. These canned foods taste delicious and are suitable for both domestic consumption and export. For example, vegetable cans such as chili peppers, tomatoes, and cowpeas contain a sulfur dioxide solution that can preserve the original shape and taste of the fresh vegetables, making them ideal for field geological exploration personnel.

After the first batch of new canned goods appeared on domestic and foreign markets, they were praised by consumers. Currently, the Soviet Union, North Korea, and the United Kingdom have signed orders with China.

    六十多种新罐头开始生产
    新华社23日电　今年我国试制成功了六十多种新罐头品种。在这些新品种中，有十五种已经先后在国营上海、天津、松江等大型罐头厂大量生产；其余品种最近也将同消费者见面。
    今年试制成功的新罐头有对虾、花生米、鲥鱼、酸西红柿等。这些罐头食品味道鲜美，既适合国内人民食用又适合出口。如蔬菜类辣椒、蕃茄、豇豆罐头，里边放有一种二氧化硫溶液，能保持鲜菜的原形和味道，最适合野外地质勘察人员食用。
    第一批新罐头品种出现在国内外市场上以后，受到了广大消费者的赞扬。现在有苏联、朝鲜、英国同我国签订了订货合同。
