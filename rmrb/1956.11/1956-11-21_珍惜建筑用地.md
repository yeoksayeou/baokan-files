    Cherish Construction Land
    Li Ce
    The western Sichuan plain is fertile, and crop yields are high. Some basic construction units do not know how to cherish such valuable land, mechanically applying standard designs. Many factories occupy a lot of land and even build unnecessary buildings, wasting land.
    The silk reeling factory newly built by the Ministry of Textile Industry in Mianyang County has this problem. In the winter of 1954, the Southwest Textile Administration sent people to select a site for the factory in Mianyang County. The terrain was flat, close to the railway and the Minjiang River, making transportation and water use convenient. At the same time, Mianyang is also a silk-producing area. In the opinion of the Southwest Textile Administration, this factory site was ideal, so they asked the local government for land. Unexpectedly, the location of this factory site undermined the overall long-term plan for urban construction. However, the Ministry of Textile Industry was unwilling to consider the long-term interests of urban planning and relocate, citing various reasons why it could not be changed when construction had just begun.
    Secondly, the factory site wastes too much land. All seventy-five dormitories are single-story buildings. The distance between the dormitories reaches twenty-four city feet. Preliminary estimates show that at least thirty mu of land is wasted. From the perspective of the unit's own interests: a spacious place is better than a narrow one; building single-story buildings is cheaper than building multi-story buildings, and it is also necessary for fire safety. However, the significant loss to grain production year after year due to the excessive occupation of such fertile farmland should also be considered comprehensively.
    In order to compensate for the defect of land wastage in the staff dormitory, this batch of dormitories had to be sold to the Southwest Construction Engineering Bureau at a discounted price of 400,000 yuan for use as temporary dormitories for construction workers. The designed lifespan of this batch of dormitories is thirty years, but the Southwest Construction Engineering Bureau can only use it for a little over ten years. In addition, a piece of land was allocated from the local government to rebuild a two-story staff dormitory.
    Doctrinaire thinking in design, mechanical copying, and disregard for local specific conditions are the main roots of unreasonable factory site selection and land wastage. At the same time, it has also found an excuse for departmentalism.
    People know that there is not much flat land in Sichuan. However, some units insist on placing the school's site in a flat area and refuse to place it on a hillside. A newly built college in Chengdu wants to build a football field in the suburbs of Chengdu, where land is precious. Of course, a football field is necessary for students' sports activities, but its utilization rate and local land conditions must also be considered.
    The provincial and local party committees and people's committees have been doing their best to support the basic construction projects of various central ministries. The leading comrades of the CPC Mianyang Prefectural Committee often remind themselves to prevent departmentalism views and practices that disregard the overall situation (although there are not no shortcomings in various support work). However, some comrades from various central ministries in charge of basic construction projects lack a humble attitude. They select factory sites and school sites, handle relevant basic construction affairs, do not care about the local situation, do not respect the opinions of local comrades enough, and lack room for consultation. Individual comrades have an arrogant attitude of "coming from the central government" and "coming from the superior", emphasizing "my project is important" and "my project is special", only seeking their own convenience, regardless of the convenience of others.
    In the future, basic construction projects such as factories and cultural education in Sichuan Province, like other provinces, will have great development. In the selection of factory sites, school sites, and other related basic construction affairs, many disputes will inevitably occur. Therefore, mutual respect, more consultation, and the elimination of any unreasonable phenomenon have become very important issues.

    珍惜建筑用地
    李策
    川西平原，土地肥沃，农作物产量很高。有些基本建设单位不晓得爱惜这样珍贵的土地，教条主义地搬弄标准设计，不少的工厂占地很多，甚至修建了些不必要的建筑物，浪费了土地。
    纺织工业部在绵阳县境内新建的缫丝厂，就有这个毛病。1954年冬季，西南纺织管理局派人在绵阳县选择了厂址，它地势平坦，靠近铁路、岷江，交通和用水都是便利的；同时，绵阳也是产蚕区。在西南纺织管理局来看，这个厂地是很理想的，就向地方上要了地皮。不料，这个厂地位置破坏了整个城市建设的远景规划。而纺织工业部却不愿意为城市规划的长远利益着想，重新调个地方，在刚开始修建时，提出了种种不能调换的理由。
    其次，厂地浪费土地太多。七十五幢宿舍，全部是平房。宿舍之间的距离，达到二十四市尺。初步估算，顶少浪费土地三十亩。从本单位利益来看：地方宽阔比狭窄好；盖平房比盖楼房省钱，在防火安全上也有必要。但是，多占了这样肥沃的农田，一年一年下去，对粮食生产是个多么重大的损失，也应该全盘考虑。
    为了弥补职工宿舍浪费土地的缺陷，今年只好把这批宿舍折价四十万元，卖给西南建筑工程局，作为建筑工人临时宿舍。这批宿舍设计的寿命是三十年，西南建筑工程局只能用个十几年。另外从地方上拨了一块地皮，重新修建二楼一底的职工宿舍。
    设计思想上的教条主义，生搬硬套，不顾当地的具体情况，是厂址不合理，土地浪费的主要根源。同时，也替本位主义的做法，找到了借口。
    人们知道，四川的平地并不是很多的。但是有的单位一定要把学校的校址放在平坦地区，不肯放在山坡上。成都市新建的一所学院，要在成都土地珍贵的郊区，修一座足球场。当然，足球场对学生体育活动来说是必要的，但也要看看它的利用率和当地土地情况。
    省内各地方党委、人民委员会对来自中央各部基本建设工程，都是竭尽全力加以支援的。中共绵阳地委的领导同志们，经常提醒自己，防止不顾大局的本位主义观点和做法。（虽然在各项支援工作上，不是毫无缺点）。可是有些来自中央各部的负责基本建设工程的同志，却缺乏谦虚作风。他们选择厂址、校址、办理有关各项基本建设事务，不关心地方上的情况，尊重地方上同志们的意见不够，缺少商量的余地。个别同志有“中央来的”，“上级来的”傲慢的态度，强调：“我的工程重要”，“我的工程特殊”，只图自己方便，不管别人方便。
    今后，四川省工厂、文化教育等各项基本建设工程，跟其他省份一样，将有很大的发展。无论在选择厂址、校址，以及其他有关基本建设事务上，必然会发生许多纠葛。因此，互相尊重，多多商量，消除任何不合理的现象就成为十分重要的问题了。
