    Block the Reactionaries' Road in Hungary
    --Soviet "Pravda" Editorial, November 4th
    The Hungarian events have attracted the attention of public opinion in various countries. The Soviet people, with friendly feelings towards the fraternal Hungarian people, cannot but closely concern themselves with the achievements and difficulties of the Hungarian working people in their struggle to develop their country along the path of socialism.

    Millions of Soviet people deeply sympathize with the efforts of the Hungarian working people to victoriously develop their country as a free, sovereign, and socialist state. We understand the desire of Hungarian workers, peasants, and intellectuals to raise the living standards of the residents, and to fully utilize the great superiority of the people's democratic system to this end. We understand their legitimate demands for correcting the serious mistakes made by leaders in the past, thoroughly eliminating the consequences of undermining socialist legality, and implementing urgent measures to further democratize social life.

    At the same time, it cannot be ignored that in the Hungarian events of recent days, along with this healthy effort of the working people, the actions of reactionary forces, seriously violating the will of the people, have become increasingly apparent. The aim of these actions is to eliminate the socialist achievements of the working people and restore capitalism in the country. In this process, anti-people elements have taken advantage of past mistakes, shouting inflammatory slogans, and attempting to deceive and lure the working people under the false banner of "freedom fighters." Of course, the honest people among the working people, especially the youth, who have been misled, cannot be equated with those counter-revolutionaries who unscrupulously deceive them. These counter-revolutionaries are hostile to the people, their interests are incompatible with those of the working people, and they hate socialism.

    Numerous facts convincingly show that the actions of the reactionary forces in Budapest are the result of long-term sabotage activities by imperialist countries. The Nyilas and Horthy elements entrenched in West Germany and Austria are carrying out activities with generous funding from the imperialists. This money is used to conduct unscrupulous slander campaigns against People's Hungary, launch numerous balloons with propaganda materials, conduct radio broadcasts, and develop and strengthen reactionary underground activities. It is these reactionary forces that are now lawlessly destroying socialist enterprises created by the people with their own labor in Hungary, destroying state organs, public institutions, and newspaper offices, burning a large number of books, killing workers, and brutally persecuting Hungarian communists and progressive social figures.

    In the streets of Hungarian cities, there are corpses of people who have been tortured to death, shot, and hanged everywhere. Rampant reactionaries are destroying the monuments to Soviet soldiers who sacrificed their lives to liberate Budapest from the rule of the Hitlerite bandits.

    Foreign news indicates that the Hungarian reactionary forces are relying on the support of imperialist countries. Armed Horthy officers and various traitorous exiles are constantly crossing the border into Hungary. Reactionary bourgeois newspapers are gleefully welcoming news of counter-revolutionary activities. "The Washington Post" and "The Herald Tribune" openly say that the hope of the imperialist bloc is that the victory of the Hungarian reactionaries "will drastically change the balance of power in the world," that is, will strengthen imperialism and the forces of war.

    At the request of the Hungarian government, the Soviet government agreed to send Soviet troops into Budapest to help the Hungarian People's Army and the Hungarian authorities restore order in the city. On October 25, the head of the Hungarian government, Nagy, said in a radio address that the arrival of Soviet troops "is necessary for the vital interests of our socialist system." However, Nagy's verbal acknowledgment of the danger of "counter-revolutionary agitators" has, in practice, objectively become a patron of reactionary forces, which has complicated the situation in Budapest and throughout Hungary. In view of the fact that the continued stationing of Soviet troops in Hungary might become a cause of increasing tension, the Soviet government ordered its military command to withdraw Soviet troops from Budapest.

    The continued development of events proves that the reactionary forces in Hungary, with the direct connivance of the Imre Nagy government, have become even more unscrupulous, and the bloody terror of killing working people has reached an unprecedented scale. Under these conditions, it is very clear that Imre Nagy cannot, and does not want to, fight against the dark reactionary forces. The Nagy government has virtually collapsed, ceding its position to anti-people elements. Hungary is now in chaos. Economic and cultural life is paralyzed. Industrial enterprises and railway transportation have come to a standstill. Various reactionary groups in the country are attempting to seize power, touting various pleasing names, putting forward many high-sounding programs and inflammatory slogans. For example, it is well known that in Győr, a group of Horthy fascists are directing the activities of counter-revolutionaries.

    The people of the socialist countries, united by the great goal of building socialism and the lofty principles of proletarian internationalism, have expressed due concern about what is happening in Hungary. The working people of the socialist countries are increasingly worried about the conspiracies of the reactionaries in Hungary and express reasonable indignation.

    The "People's Daily," the organ of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, wrote: "We are saddened to see that a very small number of counter-revolutionary conspirators are taking advantage of the situation to attempt to restore capitalism and fascist terror in Hungary, and to try to open a gap in Hungary to fracture the unity of socialist countries and undermine the Warsaw Pact."

    The Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party said in a letter to the working class and the Polish people: Recently, "the situation in Hungary has entered a new and dangerous stage. It is becoming increasingly clear that counterrevolutionaries are gaining the upper hand. The foundations of the socialist system are under threat. Chaos and anarchy are spreading throughout the country. Counter-revolutionary gangs are carrying out lynching and brutally murdering communists.

    "The Polish working class and all our people are watching the development of the situation with great concern. The reactionary forces that pushed Hungary towards disaster have been decisively condemned in Poland."

    "Rudé Právo," the organ of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, emphasized that today, the characteristic of the development of the Hungarian events is that the backward actions of separating from socialist ideology and violating the principles of the consolidated unity of socialist countries in the struggle against imperialist conspiracies and in defense of peace have had new development.

    Hungarian Government Chairman Nagy took this step: he declared Hungary's immediate withdrawal from the Warsaw Pact. The newspaper also wrote that the reactionaries have blatantly adopted a policy of excluding communists from participating in state administration in order to freely and extensively infringe upon the achievements of the Hungarian working people and their fundamental democratic rights.

    The anti-people actions provoked by the enemies of the Hungarian working class, the enemies of peace and socialism in Budapest, have aroused full anger among the Bulgarian working people. The National Committee of the Fatherland Front said in a letter to the Bulgarian people that the enemies of peace and socialism are now trying by all means to obstruct the people from advancing towards the victory of peace and socialism. The national budgets of the United States and other imperialist countries have allocated hundreds of millions of dollars to carry out subversion and terrorist actions against socialist countries. The message said that the Bulgarian people in these days expressed brotherly support to the Hungarian working people, and indignation at the insidious plans of the imperialists, because the imperialists attempted to separate the Hungarian people from the road of peace and socialism, and destroy their friendship with the people of socialist countries.

    In evaluating the situation in Hungary, "Borba," the publication of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, pointed out that now, the arrogance of various anti-socialist forces is becoming increasingly high. They have taken advantage of the difficult situation in Hungary and want to turn Hungary towards anti-socialist development.

    "Scînteia" expressed the opinions of all the Romanian people, and the newspaper pointed out that the people of all socialist countries have learned a lesson from the events in Hungary, and they will do everything possible to thwart the conspiracies of the imperialist groups and all domestic and foreign reactionary forces that oppose the people's democratic system, national independence, and peace.

    The Hungarian events once again remind all true fighters who safeguard the interests of the working class and the working people and strive for the great cause of socialism that they must heighten revolutionary vigilance, and their sacred duty is to defend the socialist achievements of the people and resolutely and ruthlessly oppose the conspiracies of the reactionaries.

    The experience of the history of the Hungarian working class's revolutionary struggle once again proves the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism on class struggle, proving that the exploiting classes will not give up their positions without a fight, and that these classes, with the support of the imperialist reactionaries, have attempted to restore their beloved capitalist system and attempt to re-impose the shackles of capitalist enslavement on workers and peasants, and they will not give up this attempt in the future.

    Everyone knows how cruelly and ruthlessly the imperialist reactionaries suppressed the revolutionary forces in Hungary in 1919, when they successfully submerged the young Hungarian Workers' and Peasants' Republic in blood. Now, when the fascist reactionaries are attempting to once again bloodily suppress the socialist fighters in Hungary, the call issued by the great Lenin to the Hungarian working class in May 1919 appears particularly powerful. In those fighting revolutionary days, Lenin, in his article "Greetings to the Hungarian workers," pointed out the great and responsible tasks of the working class, pointing out that the mission of this class is to overthrow the exploiters, ruthlessly suppress their resistance, not be deceived by the false slogans of "freedom," and must be unwavering in the struggle for the victory of socialism.

    The Hungarian working class and all working people know very well what the consequences of the victory of the counter-revolutionaries in their country in 1919 brought. They have learned from personal experience what the true value of the hypocritical slogans of "democracy and freedom" are, under which the imperialist reactionaries established the Horthy fascist dictatorship in the country. Relying on the fascist dictatorship of Hitler Germany, in the years of World War II, it dragged the country into a bloody adventure and led it to a national disaster.

    The Hungarian workers, peasants, and people's intellectuals who in the past revived the motherland with their labor, developed the national economy and culture, and built a new life without the rule of capitalists and landlords, certainly did not do so to allow the fascist reactionaries to regain power at present, nor to allow capitalists and landlords to regain control of all the country's wealth.

    No matter how rampant the reactionaries are, and no matter how enthusiastically the reactionary imperialists encourage them, the reactionaries cannot defeat the people's democratic system in Hungary, because the Hungarian people, who have taken control of their own destiny and established their own national, independent people's democratic country, have worked selflessly for more than ten years to create and consolidate this system.

    People's Hungary is experiencing days of decisive significance for the fate of its future development, and the question now is this: will Hungary continue to advance along the path of socialist development in the future, or will the reactionary forces that attempt to restore the old order and set the country back decades prevail in the country?

    The victory of the democratic forces led by the working class will guarantee Hungary's true national independence, full democratic freedom for all the people, and cooperation based on the Leninist principles of equality, respect for national sovereignty, and fraternal mutual assistance with all socialist countries. Only under these conditions will it be possible for People's Hungary to rapidly develop its economy and culture, improve the welfare of the people, gain due prestige in international affairs, and contribute to the cause of consolidating peace.

    If the anti-people and reactionary forces gain power by deceiving with hypocritical slogans and direct armed violence, then Hungary will inevitably fall into the clutches of powerful imperialist countries, lose its national independence for a long time, and become a plaything in the foreign policy conspiracies of aggressive blocs that are plotting new wars. If the reactionaries seize power, they will establish white terror, cruelly suppress any progressive ideas, and hinder the development of national economy and culture.

    There is no doubt that the Hungarian people, the working class, and all sincere patriots of Hungary will find the strength in themselves to defeat the reactionaries and lead the country onto the path of victorious advance, gradually realizing the great ideals of socialism. The Hungarian people's struggle to maintain and consolidate the people's democratic system in a free, independent, and socialist Hungarian country will receive the unanimous support of the Soviet people, the people of all socialist countries, and the working people of the world.

    Blocking the road of the reactionaries in Hungary is the urgent task determined by the course of events.

    堵塞反动派在匈牙利的道路
    ——苏联“真理报”11月4日社论
    匈牙利事件吸引了各国舆论的注意。对兄弟的匈牙利人民怀着友谊之情的苏联人民，不能不密切关心匈牙利劳动人民在沿着社会主义道路发展国家的斗争中的成就和困难。
    千百万的苏联人深切地同情匈牙利劳动人民为了使自己的国家作为一个自由的、主权的社会主义国家胜利发展而作的努力。我们理解匈牙利工人、农民和知识分子要求提高居民的生活水平，并且为此而充分利用人民民主制度的巨大优越性的愿望。我们理解他们对纠正领导人过去所犯的严重错误、彻底清除破坏社会主义法制的后果和执行使社会生活进一步民主化的迫切措施的正当要求。
    同时也不能不看到，最近几天在匈牙利事件中，同劳动人民群众的这种健康的努力同时，也日益明显地出现了严重违反人民意志的反动势力的行动，这种行动的目的是消灭劳动人民的社会主义果实并且在国内恢复资本主义。在这当中，反人民的分子利用了过去的错误，叫着煽动人心的口号，在“自由战士”的假招牌的掩盖下企图欺骗劳动人民群众，引诱他们。当然，不能把劳动人民中间，特别是青年中间误入迷途的正直的人同那些不顾信义地欺骗他们的反革命分子混为一谈。这些反革命分子敌视人民，他们是同劳动人民的利益格格不入的，他们仇视社会主义。
    许许多多事实令人信服地表明，反动势力在布达佩斯的行动是帝国主义国家的长期破坏活动的结果。盘据在西德和奥地利的尼拉什分子和霍尔蒂分子就是靠帝国主义者的慷慨拨款进行活动的。用这些钱来对人民匈牙利进行肆无忌惮的诽谤运动，放出许许多多带有宣传材料的汽球，进行无线电广播，展开和加强反动的地下活动。正是这些反动势力现在在匈牙利无法无天破坏人民用自己的劳动所创造的社会主义企业，捣毁国家机关、公共机构和报社，大量焚烧书籍，杀害工人，凶狠地迫害匈牙利共产党人和进步社会人士。
    在匈牙利各城市的街道上，到处有被拷打死的、被枪杀的和被吊死的人的尸体。猖狂的反动分子正在破坏为了从希特勒匪帮统治下解放布达佩斯而捐躯的苏军战士的纪念碑。
    外国的消息表明，匈牙利反动势力是仰仗帝国主义国家的支持的。武装的霍尔蒂军官、各种卖国的流亡分子在不断地越界进入匈牙利。反动的资产阶级报纸兴高彩烈地欢迎关于反革命分子活动的消息。“华盛顿邮报”和“时代先驱报”公然说，帝国主义集团的希望是，匈牙利反动派的胜利“将急剧地改变世界力量的对比”，也就是将加强帝国主义和战争势力。
    根据匈牙利人民政府的请求，苏联政府同意苏联部队开入布达佩斯帮助匈牙利人民军和匈牙利当局整顿市内秩序。匈牙利政府首脑纳吉10月25日在广播演说中说，苏军的开来“是我们社会主义制度切身利益所必需的”。但是，纳吉在口头上承认“反革命煽动者”的危险，实际上却客观地成为反动势力的赞助者，这不能不使布达佩斯和匈牙利全国的情势复杂化。鉴于苏军继续驻扎匈牙利可能成为局势越发紧张的原因，苏联政府命令自己的军事指挥部把苏军撤出布达佩斯。
    事件的继续发展证明，在匈牙利的反动势力利用了伊姆雷·纳吉政府的直接纵容，更加肆无忌惮起来了，杀害劳动人民的血腥恐怖达到了空前未有的规模。在这种条件下非常明显，伊姆雷·纳吉不能、也不想同黑暗的反动势力展开斗争。纳吉政府实际上已经崩溃，把阵地让给了反人民分子。匈牙利现在一片混乱。经济和文化生活陷于瘫痪状态。工业企业和铁路运输都停顿了。国内形形色色的反动集团企图夺取政权，他们标榜着各式各样好听的名称，提出了许多冠冕堂皇的纲领以及煽惑人心的口号。例如，大家都知道，在吉厄尔就有一批霍尔蒂法西斯分子在指导反革命分子的活动。
    由伟大的建设社会主义目际和崇高的无产阶级国际主义原则团结起来的各社会主义国家的人民，对匈牙利所发生的情况表示了应有的不安。社会主义国家的劳动人民对反动派在匈牙利的阴谋日益感到忧虑，并且表示合理的愤慨。
    中国共产党中央委员会机关报“人民日报”写道：“我们痛心地看到，极少数反革命阴谋家正在利用局势，企图在匈牙利实行资本主义复辟和法西斯恐怖，企图从匈牙利打开破裂社会主义国家团结、破坏华沙条约的缺口”。
    波兰统一工人党中央委员会在告工人阶级、波兰人民书中说：最近“匈牙利的局势进入了一个新的危险的阶段。越来越明显地，反革命分子在占据上风。社会主义制度的基础受到了威胁。混乱和无政府状态正在全国蔓延。反革命匪帮正在施行私刑，并且兽性地杀害共产党员。
    “波兰工人阶级和我们全体人民都以极大的关怀注视着局势的发展。把匈牙利推向灾难的反动势力在波兰遭到了决定性的谴责”。
    捷克斯洛伐克共产党机关报“红色权利报”强调指出，今天，匈牙利事件发展的特点是，脱离社会主义思想和违背社会主义国家在反对帝国主义阴谋和捍卫和平的斗争中的巩固团结的原则的倒退做法有了新的发展。
    匈牙利政府主席纳吉采取了这个步骤：他声明匈牙利立刻退出华沙条约。报纸还写道，反动派明目张胆地采取了排除共产党人参加国家管理的方针，以便畅所欲为地大举侵犯匈牙利劳动人民的成果，侵犯他们的基本民主权利。
    匈牙利工人阶级的敌人，和平和社会主义的敌人在布达佩斯所挑起的反人民行动，激起了保加利亚劳动人民满腔愤怒。祖国阵线全国委员会在告保加利亚人民书中说，和平和社会主义的敌人现在不择手段地企图阻挠人民向和平和社会主义胜利迈进。美国和其他帝国主义国家的国家预算中拨出数以亿计的美元，用来对社会主义国家进行颠复活动和恐怖行动。文告说，保加利亚人民在这几天对匈牙利劳动人民表示兄弟的声援，对帝国主义者的阴险计划表示激愤，因为帝国主义者企图使匈牙利人民脱离和平和社会主义的道路，破坏他们同社会主义阵营各国人民的友谊。
    南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟的“战斗报”在评价匈牙利局势的时候指出，现在，各种反社会主义势力的气焰是越来越高涨了。他们利用了匈牙利的困难情况，想使匈牙利转向反社会主义的道路发展。
    “火花报”表达了全体罗马尼亚人民的意见，报纸指出，各社会主义国家的人民从匈牙利的事件中取得教训，他们将竭尽一切努力，使帝国主义集团和一切反对人民民主制度、民族独立与和平的国内外反动势力的阴谋破产。
    匈牙利事件一次又一次地提醒全体维护工人阶级和劳动人民的利益、为伟大的社会主义事业而奋斗的真正战士必须提高革命警惕性，他们的神圣的职责是，保卫人民的社会主义成果，坚决无情地反对反动派的阴谋。
    匈牙利工人阶级革命斗争史的经验一次又一次地证明了马克思列宁主义关于阶级斗争的基本原理，证明了剥削阶级是不会不经过战斗就放弃自己的阵地的，他们这些阶级在帝国主义反动派的支持下曾经企图使他们心爱的资本主义制度复辟、企图重新把资本主义奴役的枷锁加到工人和农民身上，他们将来也还是不会放弃这种企图的。
    大家都知道，帝国主义反动派在1919年曾经多么残酷无情地镇压过匈牙利的革命力量，那时他们成功地把年青的匈牙利工农共和国淹没在血泊中。现在，当法西斯反动派企图又一次血腥镇压匈牙利的社会主义战士的时候，伟大的列宁在1919年5月间向匈牙利工人阶级发出的号召显得特别有力量。在那些战斗的革命日子里，列宁在他的一篇文章“向匈牙利工人致敬”中曾经指出了工人阶级的伟大的和责任重大的任务，指出这个阶级的使命是推翻剥削者、无情地镇压他们的反抗、不要被虚伪的“自由”口号所欺骗，必须在争取社会主义胜利的斗争中坚定不移。
    匈牙利的工人阶级和全体劳动人民都很清楚地知道，反革命分子1919年在他们国家的胜利带来了怎样的后果。他们根据亲身的经验认识到了虚伪的“民主和自由”的口号的真正价值怎样，帝国主义反动派就是在这个口号掩盖下在国内建立了霍尔蒂法西斯独裁。把自己的命运寄托在希特勒德国的法西斯独裁上，在第二次世界大战年代里把国家卷入血腥冒险之中，并且把它导向民族灾难的境地。
    匈牙利的工人、农民和人民知识分子过去以自己的劳动复兴祖国、发展国家经济和文化、建设没有资本家和地主统治的新生活，决不是为了让法西斯反动派在目前重新掌握政权，不是为了让资本家和地主重新掌握国家所有财富。
    无论反动派如何猖狂，无论反动的帝国主义者如何热心鼓励，反动派都不能打垮匈牙利的人民民主制度，因为掌握了自己的命运并且建立了自己的民族的、独立的人民民主国家的匈牙利人民，为创立和巩固这种制度而忘我地劳动了十多年。
    人民的匈牙利在经历着对它今后发展的命运有决定意义的日子，现在的问题是这样：匈牙利今后仍然沿着社会主义发展的道路前进呢，还是企图恢复旧秩序、使国家倒退数十年的反动势力在国内占上风？
    工人阶级领导的民主力量的胜利，就会保证匈牙利有真正的民族独立，全民的充分的民主自由、以平等、尊重民族主权和同各个社会主义国家兄弟互助这些列宁主义原则为基础的合作。只有在这种条件下，人民的匈牙利才有可能迅速发展经济和文化、增进人民的福利，才会在国际问题上得到应有的威信，并且对巩固和平的事业作出贡献。
    如果反人民的反动势力靠虚伪的口号的欺骗和直接的武装暴力而得势，那末匈牙利就不可避免地会落入强大的帝国主义国家的魔爪中，长期丧失自己的民族独立，并且成为正在策划新战争的侵略集团的外交政策阴谋中的玩物。反动派夺取了政权，就会建立白色恐怖，残酷地压制任何进步思想，阻碍民族经济和文化的发展。
    无可怀疑，匈牙利人民、工人阶级、匈牙利的一切真诚的爱国者将在本身找到力量来打垮反动派，并把国家引上胜利前进的道路，逐步实现社会主义的伟大理想。匈牙利人民为在自由独立的社会主义的匈牙利维护和巩固人民民主制度的斗争，将得到苏联人民、各社会主义国家人民、全世界劳动人民的一致支持。
    堵塞匈牙利反动派的道路，这就是事件的进程确定的刻不容缓的任务。
