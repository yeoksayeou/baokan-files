The Miao people are one of the hardworking and intelligent ethnic groups in our great motherland. Like other minority ethnic groups, they have been relatively backward in many aspects due to the rule of reactionary forces throughout history. Since liberation, the Party and the People's Government have correctly implemented ethnic policies, enabling the political and economic development of the Miao people to gradually progress. However, except for the area in northeastern Yunnan and northwestern Guizhou (Weining Yi, Hui, and Miao Autonomous County, Hezhang County), where a writing system was created by missionaries, most Miao regions still do not have their own script. As early as 1951, the former Government Administration Council decided to assist ethnic groups without writing systems in creating their own. The Constitution of the People's Republic of China also clearly stipulates that "All nationalities have the freedom to use and develop their own spoken and written languages" (Article 3). The Institute of Linguistics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Central Institute for Nationalities, and other relevant institutions have conducted multiple language surveys in Miao areas and have carried out relatively in-depth research on individual dialects.

According to the instructions of the central government and the plan for minority language work, it is planned to propose a Miao language writing scheme this year. In order to complete this task as scheduled, the Second Working Team for Minority Language Surveys of the Chinese Academy of Sciences organized four teams (Eastern Route, Central Route, Western Route, and South Central Guizhou) and a Hainan Island group from May to September this year to conduct separate investigations. Supplementary surveys were conducted in southeastern, western, and northwestern Guizhou, and northern and northwestern Guangxi; general surveys were conducted in western and southwestern Hunan, northeastern, central, and southern Guizhou, southern and southeastern Sichuan, northeastern Yunnan, southwestern Hubei, and Hainan Island in Guangdong. A total of thirty-five groups were organized, investigating more than seventy counties and cities, and recording materials from more than two hundred locations. Now, the first stage of the investigation work (referring to the period before the creation of the script) has been completed. After a period of comparative study, the materials have been preliminarily organized.

        Miao Language Dialect Situation

The Miao people are distributed in seven provinces, including Guizhou, Hunan, Yunnan, Guangxi, Sichuan, Hubei, and Guangdong, with a population of more than 2.5 million. Only the following regions have languages that are not the same. The Miao people on Hainan Island, about 11,000, speak a language close to the Yao language in Xing'an, Guangxi. More than 50,000 Miao people in Longsheng Autonomous County and most of Chengbu County, Hunan, share a dialect of Chinese. About 20,000 Miao people in Baishi area of Tianzhu County, Guizhou, speak another dialect of Chinese. More than 7,000 Miao people in Yangchong and Dagaoping areas of Tongdao Autonomous County, Hunan, and Gundong area of Liping County, Guizhou, speak the local Dong language. Most of the Miao people in Yongshun County and Longshan County, Hunan, numbering more than 20,000, speak the local Chinese.

Based on the material, we have tentatively divided the Miao language into the following dialects:

    I. Eastern Dialect: The Miao people who speak this dialect mainly live in the Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Prefecture and Songtao and Tongren counties in northeastern Guizhou, and Xiushan County in eastern Sichuan. In addition, a small number of people live in Xinhuang Dong Autonomous County and Mayang County in Hunan, Hechi, Nandan, and Du'an Yao Autonomous Counties in Guangxi, Rongjiang County in Guizhou, and Xuanen County in Hubei. More than 440,000 people speak this dialect, with Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Prefecture and Songtao, Guizhou forming a large concentrated area. This dialect is further divided into two sub-dialects: (1) Eastern Sub-dialect: This sub-dialect is used in Luxi County, eastern Jishou County, eastern Guzhang County, and southern Longshan County in Hunan. The number of people who speak this sub-dialect is about 40,000. This sub-dialect is further divided into three local languages: the Southern local language is used in Xiaozhang and Dazhang areas of Luxi County, and the number of people who speak this local language is small; the Central local language is used in most of Luxi County, eastern Jishou County, and southern Guzhang County, with about 30,000 people speaking this local language; the Northern local language is used in southern Longshan County, with only four to five thousand people speaking this local language. (2) Western Sub-dialect: This sub-dialect is used in the entire Miao areas of Fenghuang, Huayuan, and Baojing counties in Hunan, Songtao and Tongren counties in Guizhou, and Xiushan County in Sichuan, as well as most areas of Jishou County and western Guzhang County in Hunan. The Miao people in Xinhuang Dong Autonomous County and Mayang in Hunan, Nandan, Hechi, and Du'an Yao Autonomous Counties in Guangxi, and Xuanen County in Hubei also speak this sub-dialect. The total number of people who speak this sub-dialect is about 400,000. This sub-dialect is further divided into two local languages: the Eastern local language is used in eastern Huayuan County, western and northern Jishou County, eastern Baojing County, western Guzhang County, and Baren Township of Fenghuang County in Hunan, and Xuanen County in Hubei. About 80,000 people speak this local language. The Western local language is used in the entire Miao areas of Fenghuang County (except for Baren Township), Songtao and Tongren counties in Guizhou, and Xiushan County in Sichuan, as well as most areas of Huayuan County and western Baojing County in Hunan, and southern Jishou County. In addition, the language spoken by some Miao people in Xinhuang Dong Autonomous County and Mayang in Hunan, Nandan, Hechi, and Du'an Yao Autonomous Counties in Guangxi, and Rongjiang County in Guizhou also belongs to this local language. About 320,000 people speak this local language.

    II. Central Dialect: The Miao people who speak this dialect mainly live in the Southeast Guizhou Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture and the Great Miao Mountain Miao Autonomous County and Sanjiang Dong Autonomous County in Guangxi. Miao people in some areas of Duyun, Sandu, Libo, Guanling, Zhenfeng, Xingren, Anlong, Pingba, Fuquan, and Qingzhen counties in Guizhou, and Jingxian and Huitong counties in Hunan also speak this dialect. About 900,000 people speak this dialect, with the Southeast Guizhou Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture being a large concentrated area. This dialect is further divided into two sub-dialects: (1) Northern Sub-dialect. Except for some areas of Libo and Congjiang counties in Guizhou, this sub-dialect is used throughout the entire dialect area, and the number of people who speak this sub-dialect accounts for more than 99% of the population in the dialect area. This sub-dialect is further divided into four local languages: the Northern local language is used in Huangping, Shibing, Zhenyuan, Leishan, Lushan, Taijiang, and Jianhe counties in Guizhou, and some areas of Danzhai, Majiang, Guanling, Fengzhen, Anlong, Xingren, Fuquan, and Pingba counties, with about 500,000 people speaking this local language; the Central local language is used in Sandu and Duyun counties in Guizhou and most areas of Danzhai, with about 100,000 people speaking this local language; the Southern local language is used in most areas of Congjiang and Rongjiang counties in Guizhou, and the Great Miao Mountain Miao Autonomous County and Sanjiang Dong Autonomous County in Guangxi, with about 200,000 people speaking this local language; the Eastern local language is used in Tianzhu, Jinping, and Sansui counties in Guizhou, Jingxian and Huitong counties in Hunan, and some areas of Liping in Guizhou, with about 100,000 people speaking this local language. (2) Southern Sub-dialect. This sub-dialect is used in Libo County and one township in Congjiang County, Guizhou, with about 6,000 people speaking this sub-dialect.

    III. Western Dialect: The Miao people who speak this dialect mainly live in southern Sichuan, western Guizhou, western Guangxi, and southeastern Yunnan. A small number of people are scattered among the Han and other ethnic groups in western, northern, and northeastern Yunnan, and southwestern Sichuan. About 700,000 people speak this dialect. The Miao people who speak this dialect do not have large concentrated areas, but are more densely distributed in Luzhou and Yibin Special Zones in Sichuan, Bijie Special Zone in Guizhou, and Wenshan and Mengzi Special Zones in Yunnan. This dialect is further divided into two sub-dialects: (1) The first sub-dialect is used throughout the entire dialect area, and about 660,000 people speak this sub-dialect. This sub-dialect is further divided into two local languages: the first local language is used in Xuyong, Gulin, Gu Song, Xingwen, Gongxian, Gaoxian, Junlian, and Changning counties in southern Sichuan, Jinsha, Chishui, Renhuai, and Xingyi in Guizhou, and Zhenxiong, Weixin, Wenshan, Yanshan, Qiubei, Maguan, Xichou, Malipo, Funing, Hekou, Mengzi, Pingbian, Kaiyuan, Jinping, and Yuanyang counties in Yunnan. Some people who speak this local language also live in some areas of Fuquan, Shuicheng, Nayong, Dading, Qianxi, Zhijin, Puding, Qinglong, Langdai, Guanling, Zhenfeng, Xingren, Wangmo, and Anlong counties in Guizhou, and Longlin Autonomous County in Guangxi, and Gejiu City and Guangnan County in Yunnan. In addition, the Miao people scattered in various counties in western Yunnan and southwestern Sichuan also speak this local language. About 520,000 people speak this local language. The second local language is used in some areas of Zhijin, Nayong, Puding, Anshun, Guanling, Xingren, and Shuicheng counties in Guizhou, most areas of Longlin Autonomous County and Mubian County in Guangxi, and some areas of Guangnan County and Gejiu City in Yunnan. About 150,000 people speak this local language. (2) The second sub-dialect is used in Nayong, Hezhang, and Shuicheng counties in Guizhou, and a small portion in Bijie and Zhijin. About 30,000 to 40,000 people speak this sub-dialect.

    IV. Northeastern Yunnan Dialect: The people who speak this dialect mainly live in Yiliang, Daguan, Zhaotong, and Yongshan counties in northeastern Yunnan, and Weining Yi, Hui, and Miao Autonomous County and Hezhang County in Guizhou. A small number of people are scattered among the Han and other ethnic groups in Yanjin, Suijiang, Ludian, Qiaojia, Wuding, Luoci, Xundian, Lufeng, Fumin, Anning, Songming, Qujing, and Rongfeng counties and Kunming City in Yunnan. Some Miao people in Shuicheng, Zhijin, Puding, Langdai, and Ziyun counties in Guizhou also speak this dialect. About 100,000 people speak this dialect.

Regarding the Miao language in South Central Guizhou: The languages spoken by the more than 200,000 Miao people living in Guiyang City, Guizhu, Longli, Huishui, Guiding, Pingba, Anshun, Changshun, Pingtang, Ziyun, Luodian, Wangmo and other counties and cities in central and southern Guizhou Province are not very similar to the Eastern, Central, Western, and Northeastern Yunnan dialects, and they are also very inconsistent internally. Based on the investigation and research of 23 points in this area, we preliminarily believe that the Miao language in this area can be divided into four small groups. For the convenience of research, Pingba Kaisha, Huishui Gaopo, Ziyun Zongdi, and Longli Hemahe are used as representative points, respectively. Now describe as follows:

    (1) South Central Guizhou Pingkai Miao Language: People who speak this Miao language mainly live in Huayan Township and Duoga Township in Anshun County, Kaisha Township, Kaizhang Township, and Machang Township in Pingba County, the northern part of Changshun County, Wenhua Township in Huishui County, and Huaxi in Guiyang City. In addition, a small number of Miao people in Bairi Township in Huishui County, Xinshi Township in Ziyun County, and some areas of Qingzhen County and Zhenning County also speak this Miao language. It is estimated that the total number of people who speak this Miao language is about 120,000.

    (2) South Central Guizhou Huigao Miao Language: The Miao people who speak this Miao language mainly live in Gaopo Autonomous Region, Baijin Township, Yarong Township, Baimang Township, Yantou Township in Huishui County, and Yangchang Autonomous Region in Longli County. It is estimated that there are 50,000 to 60,000 people who speak this Miao language.

    (3) South Central Guizhou Zizong Miao Language: The Miao people who speak this Miao language mainly live in Zongdi, Quanchu, Lanlongpo, Xinzhai, Bandang, Kehun, and Houchang Autonomous Regions in Ziyun, and Daihua and Dayin and other places in Changshun County. Miao people scattered in the southern part of Huishui and Mubao, Hongting, and Bailuo in Luodian, as well as Jiaolang, Dayi, Rongchun, Mashan, and Changtian in Wangmo County also speak this Miao language. It is estimated that there are 50,000 to 60,000 people who speak this Miao language.

    (4) South Central Guizhou Longxi Miao Language: The people who speak this Miao language mainly live in Ximahe in the fourth district of Longli County and Napang area in Guiding County. A small number of Miao people in Fuquan also speak this Miao language. About 10,000 people speak this Miao language.

The grammatical differences between the Miao dialects are not very large (except for the Northeastern Yunnan dialect), and the biggest difference is in the vocabulary. Vocabulary is the basic material of language, so the large number of different vocabularies in each dialect will of course affect communication with each other. Moreover, since the vocabulary differences are large, the pronunciation is also very different. It is impossible to list in detail the instances of vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation differences between the dialects, but we can simply write out the numbers of similarities and differences in the vocabulary comparison of the three major dialects: East, Central, and West. We compared 2,028 words in the East and Central dialects and found 794 cognate words, accounting for 39.15% of the total, and 1,234 non-cognate words, accounting for 60.85% of the total. We compared 1,954 words in the East and West dialects and found 714 cognate words, accounting for 36.54% of the total, and 1,240 non-cognate words, accounting for 63.45% of the total. We compared 1,978 words in the Central and West dialects and found 679 cognate words, accounting for 34.18% of the total, and 1,302 non-cognate words, accounting for 65.82% of the total. We also compared 1,950 words in the East, Central, and West dialects and found 361 common cognate words, accounting for 18.51% of the total; 1,076 common non-cognate words, accounting for 55.18% of the total; and 513 words that are the same in two dialects and different in one dialect, accounting for 26.31% of the total. From these numbers, we can also see that the vocabulary differences between these three dialects are more numerous than the similarities.

    How Many Writing Systems Should the Miao Ethnic Group Create?

Obviously, the Miao language has three relatively large dialects (East, Central, and West). These three dialects have their own characteristics in terms of pronunciation and grammar, but after all, they have many similarities, and the main difference is in the vocabulary. Judging from the statistical figures above, it is practically difficult to create one writing system for these three dialects or one writing system for two dialects. For example, if we create one writing system for three dialects, and select the Central dialect as the base dialect, and select the pronunciation of one place in this dialect area as the standard pronunciation, then people in the East and West dialects will have to memorize more than half of the words that are not used in their own dialects, and they will also have to memorize a large part of the remaining small half of the words, because we say that some words are cognate, which is only proved from the perspective of etymology, and sometimes they are very different in hearing. For example, the Central dialect pronounces "salt" as ?i, and the Western dialect pronounces it as nt?e; the Eastern dialect pronounces "house" as pl??, and the Central dialect pronounces it as tsei; the Central dialect pronounces "yellow" as f??, but the Western dialect pronounces it as ka?; the Eastern dialect pronounces "high" as ?ε, but the Central dialect pronounces it as xi. After our comparative research, it has been proved that ?i and nt?e, pl?? and tsei, fa? and ka?, ?ε and xi are all cognate words. People who do not speak the base dialect will of course have to memorize these cognate words. What we are going to create is a phonetic writing system, and those who learn the writing system are not all linguistics experts. If we create one writing system, no matter how many cognate words there are, it will not solve the difficulty in learning. Furthermore, for example, if we create one writing system for the Western dialect and create one writing system for the East and Central dialects combined, then if the base dialect of the East and Central dialect writing system is set as the Central dialect, then the 400,000 people in the Eastern dialect will not be able to learn it well; if it is set as the Eastern dialect, then the 900,000 people in the Central dialect will not be able to learn it well. Therefore, we suggest creating a writing system for each of the three major dialects of the Miao language.

The Northeastern Yunnan dialect originally had a phonetic writing system, which was created by the British missionary Samuel Pollard fifty years ago. The shape of the letters is quite like square Chinese characters, and each syllable is composed of a large letter and a small letter. The large letter is the initial consonant, which is the main body of the syllable; the small letter is the vowel, which is added above, at the upper right corner, on the right side, or at the lower right corner of the large letter to indicate the tone of the syllable. For example, ? is pronounced [La?](will), ? is pronounced [La?](others) or La?(scold), ? is pronounced [L?a?](throw) or [L?a?](extend), ? is pronounced [La?](also) or [La?](happy) or [L?a?](swim). From this example, it can be seen that this writing system has great shortcomings. It can neither correctly represent the initial consonant and tone, nor can it be written continuously. In 1950, the Miao people revised it once, but it still could not overcome the difficulties of continuous writing and printing. Now that the writing system of the Miao major dialect area is about to be created, we will adopt letters based on the Latin alphabet, which is the same as the form of the Chinese phonetic writing system. In this way, only 100,000 out of more than 2.5 million Miao people will use another letter form of writing, which is very unfavorable to the intercommunication of the Miao people and the future unification of Miao writing. For this reason, the people in the Northeastern Yunnan dialect area have generally demanded the reform of the old writing system and are willing to adopt the common letter form of the Miao ethnic group. We believe that this demand is correct and that the work of writing reform should be carried out for them at the same time as the writing systems are created for other dialects.

The Miao languages in South Central Guizhou are quite divergent from each other. Also, our time for investigation and research has been short. Therefore, whether to create a common writing system for them or to use the writing systems of other dialects separately will require further research.

    Regarding the Basic Dialect and Standard Pronunciation

If we create a writing system for the Eastern dialect, we can use its Western sub-dialect as the basic dialect, and select the pronunciation of a certain point in its Western local language as the standard pronunciation. We think that Jiwei Township in Huayuan County, Hunan, is the best choice. It is the center of the Miao people who speak the Eastern dialect. At least 300,000 people can fully understand the language there, and 80,000 people can basically understand it with a little attention. A writing system designed with the pronunciation of this point as the standard pronunciation will be very convenient for the vast majority of Miao people in the dialect area to learn.

If we create a writing system for the Central dialect, we can use the Northern local language in its Northern sub-dialect as the basic dialect, and select the pronunciation of a certain point near Kaili in Lushan County, Guizhou, as the standard pronunciation. The Northern local language in the Northern sub-dialect has the widest range of use, and people in various local language areas of the Northern sub-dialect do not have great difficulty in understanding it. Kaili is also a promising new city, located on the banks of the Qingshui River. Downstream along the river, you can reach Taijiang, Jianhe, and Jinping areas; upstream along the river, you can reach Danzhai and Duyun areas. Miao people from various places often gather here. These geographical conditions give the Miao language in the Kaili area the characteristics of the pronunciation of various places. From a phonetic point of view, it is more appropriate to use the pronunciation of a certain point near Kaili as the standard pronunciation.

If we create a writing system for the Western dialect, we can use its first sub-dialect as the basic dialect, and select the pronunciation of a certain point in its first local language area as the standard pronunciation. We think that it is more appropriate to choose the location of the standard pronunciation in a certain county in the Bijie Special Zone of Guizhou.

The Northeastern Yunnan dialect is not creating a writing system, but reforming a writing system. The standard pronunciation point of the old writing system is Shimenkan in Weining Yi, Hui, and Miao Autonomous County, Guizhou. We believe that there is no need to change the location of the standard pronunciation during the writing system reform. It is still more convenient to use the pronunciation of Shimenkan as the standard pronunciation for the work.

        × × ×

The Miao writing system, which has been longed for for thousands of years, is about to be born. According to the decision of the central government, the Miao writing plan (draft) will be announced this year, and pilot implementation will be carried out next year. This is such an exciting thing.

The situation of the division of Miao language dialects and the methods for creating and reforming Miao writing systems that we have proposed are very immature and are only for the reference of Miao people and comrades who have studied the Miao language. It is unprecedented in our country for an ethnic group to create more than one writing system. We have very little experience and hope that comrades will give us more criticism and help.

    苗语方言的划分和对创立、改革苗文的意见
    中国科学院少数民族语言调查第二工作队　马学良　王辅世　张济民
    苗族是祖国大家庭中勤劳智慧的民族之一。它和其他少数民族一样，由于历代反动统治的结果，在许多方面都比较落后。解放后，党和人民政府正确贯彻了民族政策，已使苗族的政治、经济逐步得到发展。但是，苗族到现在除去滇东北和贵州西北角的威宁彝族回族苗族自治县、赫章县一带有一种传教士创立的文字以外，在绝大部分的苗族地区还没有文字。早在1951年，前政务院就决定要帮助没有文字的民族创立文字。中华人民共和国宪法又明文规定“各民族都有使用和发展自己的语言文字的自由”（第三条）。中国科学院语言研究所、中央民族学院和其他有关机关，曾多次到苗族地区进行语言调查，对个别方言还作了比较深入的研究。
    根据中央的指示和少数民族语文工作的规划，准备在今年提出苗语文字方案。为了如期完成这一任务，中国科学院少数民族语言调查第二工作队今年5月到9月在苗族地区组织了东路、中路、西路和黔中南四个分队以及海南岛小组，分头进行调查。补充调查的地区，有贵州的东南部、西部和西北部，广西的北部和西北部；普遍调查的地区，有湖南的西部和西南部，贵州的东北部、中部和南部，四川的南部和东南部，云南的东北部，湖北的西南部和广东的海南岛。前后组织了三十五个小组，调查了七十多个县、市，一共记录了二百多个点的材料。现在，调查工作的第一阶段（指方案产生之前）已经结束。经过一段时间的比较研究，材料已经初步整理出来。
            苗语方言情况
    苗族分布在贵州、湖南、云南、广西、四川、湖北、广东等七个省里，人口有二百五十多万，只有下列一些地区所说的语言不相同。海南岛的苗族约一万一千，他们说的话和广西兴安一带的瑶语接近；广西龙胜各族自治县和湖南城步县大部分的苗族共有五万多人，他们说的话是汉语的一种方言；贵州天柱县白市一带的苗族约有两万多人，他们说的是另一种汉语方言；湖南通道侗族自治县阳冲、大高坪一带和贵州黎平县滚董一带的苗族共有七千多人，说的是当地的侗语；湖南永顺县和龙山县的大部分苗族约有两万多人，说的是当地的汉语。
    我们根据材料初步划分苗语为下面几种方
  言：
    一、东部方言：说这种方言的苗族主要居住在湘西苗族自治州和贵州东北部的松桃、铜仁两县，四川东部的秀山县。另外在湖南的新晃侗族自治县、麻阳县，广西的河池、南丹、都安瑶族自治县等县，贵州的榕江县，湖北的宣恩县也有少数人居住。说这种方言的约有四十四万多人，湘西苗族自治州和贵州的松桃构成一个大聚居区。这个方言又分为两个次方言：（1）东部次方言：这种次方言通行在湖南的泸溪县，吉首县的东部，古丈县的东部，龙山县的南部。说这个次方言的人数约有四万。这个次方言又分为三个土语：南部土语通行在泸溪县的小章、大章一带，说这个土语的人数很少；中部土语通行在泸溪县的大部，吉首县的东部，古丈县的南部，说这个土语的约有三万人；北部土语通行在龙山县的南部，说这个土语的只有四五千人。（2）西部次方言：这种次方言通行在湖南的凤凰、花垣、保靖，贵州的松桃、铜仁，四川的秀山等县的全部苗族地区，湖南吉首县的大部分地区和古丈县的西部。湖南的新晃侗族自治县、麻阳，广西的南丹、河池、都安瑶族自治县等县，湖北宣恩县等地的苗族，也说这个次方言。说这个次方言的总人数约有四十万。这个次方言又分为两个土语：东部土语通行在湖南的花垣县的东部，吉首县的西部、北部，保靖县的东部，古丈县的西部，凤凰县的叭仁乡，湖北的宣恩县。说这个土语的约有八万人。西部土语通行在湖南的凤凰（除去叭仁一个乡），贵州的松桃、铜仁，四川的秀山等县的全部苗族地区，湖南花垣县的大部分地区，保靖县的西部，吉首县的南部。另外湖南的新晃侗族自治县、麻阳，广西的南丹、河池、都安瑶族自治县等县和贵州榕江县的一部分苗族所说的话，也属于这个土语。说这个土语的约有三十二万人。

    三、西部方言：说这种方言的苗族主要居住在四川南部、贵州西部、广西西部和云南东南部。在云南的西部、北部、东北部，四川的西南部，也有少数人散居在汉族和其他少数民族中间。说这个方言的约有七十万人。说这个方言的苗族没有大聚居区，只是在四川的泸州、宜宾两专区，贵州的毕节专区，云南的文山、蒙自两专区分布的密度较大。这个方言又分为两个次方言：（1）第一次方言通行在整个方言区，说这个次方言的约有六十六万人。这个次方言又分为两个土语：第一土语通行在四川南部的叙永、古宋、古蔺、兴文、珙县、高县、筠连、长宁等县，贵州的金沙、赤水、仁怀、兴义，云南的镇雄、威信、文山、砚山、丘北、马关、西畴、麻栗坡、富宁、河口、蒙自、屏边、开远、金平、元阳等县。在贵州的福泉、水城、纳雍、大定、黔西、织金、普定、晴隆、郎岱、关岭、贞丰、兴仁、望谟、安龙等县和广西隆林各族自治县，云南个旧市、广南县的一部分地区，也有说这个土语的人。另外散居在滇西、滇北、川西南各县的苗族，也说这个土语。说这个土语的约有五十二万人。第二土语通行在贵州的织金、纳雍、普定、安顺、关岭、兴仁、水城等县的一部分地区，广西隆林各族自治县、睦边等县的大部分地区，云南广南县、个旧市的一部分地区。说这个土语的约有十五万人。（2）第二次方言通行在贵州的纳雍、赫章、水城等县，毕节、织金也有一少部分。说这种次方言的约有三万至四万人。
    四、滇东北方言：说这个方言的人主要居住在云南东北部的彝良、大关、昭通、永善等县和贵州的威宁彝族回族苗族自治县和赫章县。在云南的盐津、绥江、鲁甸、巧家、武定、罗次、寻甸、禄丰、富民、安宁、嵩明、曲靖、榕峰等县和昆明市有少数散居在汉族和其他民族中间。贵州的水城、织金、普定、郎岱、紫云等县，也有一部分苗族说这个方言。说这个方言的约有十万人。
    关于黔中南一带苗语：在贵州省中南部贵阳市、贵筑、龙里、惠水、贵定、平坝、安顺、长顺、平塘、紫云、罗甸、望谟等县、市居住的约二十多万苗族所讲的话，和东、中、西、滇东北各方言都不大相同，它们内部也很不一致。根据对这个地区做了二十三个点的调查研究，我们初步认为这一带苗语可以分为四个小群。为了研究上的方便，分别以平坝凯洒、惠水高坡、紫云宗地和龙里河马河作为代表点。现在分述如下：
    （1）黔中南平凯苗语：说这种苗语的人，主要居住在安顺县的华岩乡、朵戛乡，平坝县的凯洒乡、凯掌乡、马场乡、长顺县的北部，惠水县文化乡，贵阳市的花溪等地。另外在惠水县的白日乡、紫云县的新世乡，清镇县和镇宁县的一部分地区，也有少数苗族说这种苗语。说这种苗语的总人数据估计约有十二万。
    （2）黔中南惠高苗语：说这种苗语的苗族主要居住在惠水县的高坡自治区、摆金乡、鸦绒乡、摆塝乡、岩头乡和龙里县的羊场自治区。说这种苗语的估计有五、六万人。
    （3）黔中南紫宗苗语、说这种苗语的苗族主要居住在紫云的宗地、泉初、懒龙坡、新寨、坂当、克混、猴场自治区，四大寨和长顺县的代化、打引等地。散居在惠水南部地区和罗甸的木堡、鸿亭、摆落以及望谟县的交朗、打易、绒春、麻山、长田等地的苗族，也说这种苗语。说这种苗语的估计有五，六万人。
    （4）黔中南龙洗苗语：说这种苗语的人主要居住在龙里县第四区的洗马河和贵定县的那旁一带。在福泉也有少数的苗族说这种苗语。说这种苗语的约有一万多人。
    苗语各方言之间，语法上的差别不算很大（滇东北方言除外），差异较大的是词汇。词汇是语言的基本材料，因此，各方言词汇彼此不同的很多，当然会影响到彼此通话。并且，既然词汇差别较大，语音上也就差异很大了。这里不可能详细列举各方言之间词汇、语法、语音互相差异情况的实例，但可以简单写出东、中、西三大方言词汇比较的异同数字。我们在东、中两方言中用二千零二十八个词作比较，发现同源的词七百九十四个，占总数的39.15％，不同源的词一千二百三十四个，占总数的60.85％；在东、西两方言中用一千九百五十四个词作比较，发现同源的词七百一十四个，占总数的36.54％，不同源的词一千二百四十个，占总数的63.45％；在中、西两方言中用一千九百七十八个词作比较，发现同源的词六百七十九个，占总数的34.18％，不同源的词一千三百零二个，占总数的65.82％。我们又在东、中、西三个方言用一千九百五十个词共同比较，发现共同同源的词三百六十一个，占总数的18.51％；共同不同源的词一千零七十六个，占总数的55.18％；其他两个方言相同和一个方言不相同的词五百一十三个，占总数的26.31％。从这些数字中也看出了这三个方言的词汇，相异之点比相同之点是要多一些的。
      苗族应创造几种文字
    很明显，苗语有三个比较大的方言（东、中、西）。这三个方言不论在语音、语法上都各有特征，但毕竟有许多相同之处，而主要的区别是在词汇上。由上面的统计数字看来，给这三个方言创造一种文字或给两个方言创造一种文字都有实际的困难。比如说给三个方言创造一种文字，选定中部方言为基础方言，选这个方言区一个地方的语音为标准音，那么东、西两方言的人学这种文字时要死记多一半在自己方言中不使用的词，另外一少半的词也得死记一大部分，因为我们说某些词同源，只是从语源学上证明出来的，在听觉上有时相差很远。例如中部方言把“盐”读做?i，西部方言读做nt?e；东部方言把“房子”读做pl??，中部方言读做tsei；中部方言把“黄”读做f??，西部方言却读做ka?；东部方言把“高”读做?ε，中部方言却读做xi。经我们比较研究的结果，证明?i和nt?e，pl??和tsei，fa?和ka?，?ε和xi都是同源的字，非基础方言的人学这些同源词，当然要死记。我们将要创立的是拚音文字，而学习文字的又不都是语言学专家，如果创立一种文字，尽管同源的词再多，也解决不了学习上的困难。再比如说给西部方言创立一种文字，而给东、中两方言合起来创造一种文字，那么把东、中两方言文字的基础方言定为中部方言，则东部方言的四十万人不好学；定为中部方言，则中部方言九十万人不好学。因此，我们建议给苗语的三个大方言各创立一种文字。
    滇东北方言原有一种拚音文字，是五十年前英国传教士柏格理（semual pollard）创造的。字的形状颇像方块的汉字，每个音节由一个大字母和一个小字母组成。大字母是声母，是构成音节的主体；小字母是韵母，加在大字母的上方、右上角、右侧、右下角，表示音节的声调。例如?读作〔La?〕（将要），?读作〔La?〕（别人）或La?（骂），?读作〔L?a?〕（投）或〔L?a?〕（伸入），?读作〔La?〕（也）或〔La?〕（快乐）或〔L?a?〕（游泳）。由这个例子可以看出这种文字有很大的缺点，它既不能正确地表示声母和声调，同时又不能连写。1950年苗族人士曾把它修改了一次，但仍不能克服连写和印刷上的困难。现在苗族大方言区的文字就要创立了，我们将采用和汉语拚音文字形式相同的以拉丁字母为基础的字母。这样一来，二百五十多万苗族就只有十万人使用另一种字母形式的文字了，这很不利于苗族相互间的交际和未来苗文的统一。为此，滇东北方言区的人民已普遍提出要求改革旧文字，愿采用苗族共同的字母形式。我们认为这种要求是正确的，应当在给其他方言创造文字的同时，给他们进行文字改革的工作。
    黔中南一带的苗语，互相分歧较大，我们调查、研究的时间也短，因此，将来是否给他们共创一种文字或分别使用其他方言的文字，还有待于进一步的研究。
    关于基础方言和标准音问题
    如果给东部方言创立一种文字，可用它的西部次方言做基础方言，而由它的西部土语中选一个点的语音做标准音。我们以为湖南花垣县的吉卫乡最好，那里正是东部方言苗族聚居的中心，那里的话至少有三十万人可以完全听得懂，有八万人稍加注意也可以基本上听懂。以这个点的语音做标准音设计出来的文字，极便于方言区内绝大多数的苗族学习。
    如果给中部方言创立一种文字，可用它的北部次方言中的北部土语做基础方言，而从贵州炉山县的凯里附近选一个点的语音做标准音。北部次方言中的北部土语通行的范围最广，北部次方言各土语区的人听起来没有很大的困难。凯里又是一个有发展前途的新城市，位于清水江边，沿江而下，可以到台江、剑河、锦屏一带，沿江而上可以到丹寨、都匀一带，各地苗族常常在这里汇集。这种地理上的条件使凯里一带的苗语具有各地语音的特色。从语音上看，以凯里附近的一个点的语音做标准音，是比较适当的。
    如果给西部方言创立文字，可用它的第一次方言做基础方言，而从它的第一土语区中选一个点的语音做标准音。我们觉得标准音的地点选在贵州毕节专区的某一县较为合适。
    滇东北方言不是创造文字，而是改革文字。旧文字的标准音点是贵州威宁彝族回族苗族自治县石门坎，我们认为在文字改革时，不必变更标准音的地点，仍以石门坎的语音为标准音，这样对工作是较便利的。

    盼望了千百年的苗族文字就要诞生了。依照中央的决定，今年公布苗文方案（草案），明年就要试验推行，这是多么令人兴奋的事情。
    我们提出的苗语方言划分情况和创立、改革苗文的办法都很不成熟，只是供苗族人士和对苗语有研究的同志们的参考。一个民族创立一种以上的文字，在我国还是前所未有的事。我们的经验很少，希望同志们多给我们批评和帮助。
