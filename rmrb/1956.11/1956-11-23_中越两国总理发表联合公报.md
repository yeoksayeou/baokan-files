    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, November 22nd: Joint Communiqué of the Talks between Zhou恩来, Premier of the State Council of the People’s Republic of China and Phạm Văn Đồng, Premier of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam
    At the invitation of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Zhou Enlai, Premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China, visited the Democratic Republic of Vietnam between November 18th and 21st, 1956. During his visit, President Ho Chi Minh of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam received Premier Zhou Enlai. Premier Zhou Enlai also held cordial talks with Premier Pham Van Dong of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on international issues of mutual concern and on the further consolidation and development of friendly cooperation between the two countries.
    On the Chinese side, Deputy Premier He Long also participated in the talks.
    On the Vietnamese side, Deputy Premiers Phan Ke Toai and Vo Nguyen Giap also participated in the talks.
    Both Premiers are deeply concerned about the recent international tensions caused by the aggressive acts and provocative activities of the imperialists. At the same time, they are pleased to note the strong demands and tremendous efforts of peace-loving countries and peoples of the world to ease these tensions.
    Both Premiers strongly condemn the armed aggression against Egypt by Britain, France, and their tool Israel. Both Premiers unanimously believe that the anti-colonialist forces, which have further developed since the Bandung Conference, will never allow the colonialists to realize their conspiracy to restore colonial rule. Britain, France, and Israel should immediately and unconditionally withdraw their troops from Egyptian territory without further delay. The United Nations International Police Force must not be used to infringe upon Egypt's sacred sovereignty over the Suez Canal. Both Premiers reaffirm that the People's Republic of China and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam will firmly support Egypt's just struggle against aggression and anti-colonialism until Egypt's independence and sovereignty are fully restored. Both Premiers are confident that, with the active support of Asian-African countries and peace-loving countries and peoples of the world, the Egyptian people will achieve victory in their heroic struggle to safeguard national independence and territorial integrity.
    Both Premiers unanimously believe that the imperialists' conspiracies to subvert socialist countries must be resolutely combated. These conspiracies are doomed to failure. The imperialists' attempts to divert the world's people's attention from their aggression against Egypt will also meet with shameful failure. Both Premiers reaffirm their support for the Hungarian Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government and are confident that the strength of the Hungarian working people will grow in the struggle to resolutely defend the achievements of the people's democratic system.
    During the talks, both Premiers exchanged views on the situation in Indochina. The Kingdom of Cambodia and the Kingdom of Laos have achieved good results in fulfilling the various provisions of the Geneva Accords. The policies of peace and neutrality of the governments of the Kingdom of Cambodia and the Kingdom of Laos are beneficial to peace in Asia and the world. Both governments are pleased to note that the relations between the People's Republic of China and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Kingdom of Cambodia and the Kingdom of Laos have been increasingly enhanced on the basis of the Five Principles.
    Both Premiers believe that the International Commission, composed of India, Poland, and Canada, has contributed to the restoration of peace in Vietnam and hope that they can continue to work on the basis of the Geneva Accords. At present, the implementation of the Geneva Accords in Vietnam is being seriously undermined. The South Vietnamese regime has so far refused to fulfill the political provisions stipulated in the agreement regarding the peaceful reunification of Vietnam. The United States has been obstructing the reunification of Vietnam in every possible way, attempting to turn South Vietnam into its colony and military base and to divide Vietnam for a long time. Both Premiers unanimously believe that the countries participating in the 1954 Geneva Conference have an undeniable obligation to stop this development and should take joint and effective measures to seek the complete implementation of the Geneva Accords.
    Both Premiers paid special attention to the issue of further consolidating and developing the friendship between the two countries. Both Premiers are satisfied to note that the relations between the People's Republic of China and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam are becoming increasingly close, and economic and cultural exchanges and various forms of contact are expanding. During the talks, Premier Pham Van Dong pointed out the importance of China's technical assistance to Vietnam. Premier Zhou Enlai stated that the Chinese technical personnel who have come to Vietnam under the agreement should learn from the hardworking and simple style of the Vietnamese people, share weal and woe with the Vietnamese people, and work hard to help the Vietnamese people in their construction. The Chinese people and the Vietnamese people share a common ideal. The peoples of the two countries stand firmly and closely together to oppose all conspiracies of the colonialists and safeguard peace in Asia and the world. China will, as in the past, strive to support the Vietnamese people in their economic construction and the struggle for the peaceful reunification of Vietnam. The unbreakable friendship and brotherly cooperation between China and Vietnam are important factors in ensuring the implementation of the Geneva Accords and guaranteeing the security of both countries.
    Both Premiers affirm the important significance of the Soviet government's declaration of October 30, 1956, on the basis of developing and further strengthening the friendship and cooperation between the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, and the statements of the government of the People's Republic of China and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on November 1st and November 6th, 1956, respectively, regarding this declaration. Both Premiers firmly support all measures that contribute to enhancing the mutual relations of socialist countries and strengthening the solidarity between socialist countries. Both Premiers guarantee that, in their mutual relations and in their relations with other countries, they will strictly abide by the Five Principles and resolutely prevent chauvinistic errors.
    Both Premiers are confident that Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the cordial talks between the two Premiers will not only be conducive to the further development of friendly relations between the two countries, but also to peace and security in Asia and the world.
                              November 22, 1956, in Hanoi

    新华社河内22日电　中华人民共和国国务院总理周恩来和越南民主共和国政府总理范文同会谈的联合公报
    中华人民共和国国务院总理周恩来应越南民主共和国政府的邀请，从1956年11月18日到21日访问了越南民主共和国。在访问期间，越南民主共和国胡志明主席接见了周恩来总理。周恩来总理并且同越南民主共和国政府范文同总理对两国共同关心的国际问题和进一步巩固和发展两国之间友好合作的问题进行了亲密的会谈。
    中华人民共和国方面参加会谈的还有贺龙副总理。
    越南民主共和国方面参加会谈的还有潘继遂副总理和武元甲副总理。
    两国总理十分关心最近由于帝国主义者的侵略行为和挑衅活动而造成的某些国际紧张局势。他们同时也高兴地注意到世界爱好和平的国家和人民争取和缓这种紧张局势的强烈要求和巨大努力。
    两国总理强烈谴责英国、法国和它们的工具以色列对埃及的武装侵略。两国总理一致认为，在万隆会议以后已经有了进一步发展的反殖民主义的力量，决不会容许殖民主义者实现他们恢复殖民统治的阴谋。英国、法国和以色列应该立即无条件地从埃及领土撤出它们的军队，不得再有任何拖延。联合国国际警察部队决不容许被利用来侵犯埃及对苏伊士运河的神圣主权。两国总理重申：中华人民共和国和越南民主共和国将坚决支持埃及反抗侵略和反殖民主义的正义斗争，直到埃及的独立和主权得到完全的恢复。两国总理深信，在亚非各国和世界爱好和平的国家和人民的积极支持下，埃及人民将在维护民族独立和领土完整的英勇斗争中取得胜利。
    两国总理一致认为帝国主义者颠复社会主义国家的阴谋活动必须坚决予以打击，这些阴谋活动是注定要失败的。帝国主义者企图借此转移世界人民对他们侵略埃及的注意，也将同样遭到可耻的失败。两国总理重申对匈牙利工农革命政府的支持，并且深信匈牙利劳动人民的力量在坚决捍卫人民民主制度成果的斗争中将会壮大起来。
    在会谈过程中，两国总理对印度支那的局势交换了意见。柬埔寨王国和老挝王国在履行日内瓦协议各项条款方面已经取得了良好的成果。柬埔寨王国政府和老挝王国政府的和平中立政策是有利于亚洲和世界和平的。两国政府满意地指出，中华人民共和国和越南民主共和国同柬埔寨王国和老挝王国的关系，在五项原则的基础上，已经日益增进。
    两国总理认为，以印度为首的有波兰和加拿大参加的国际委员会对于越南和平的恢复是有贡献的，并且希望他们能够在日内瓦协议的基础上继续工作。目前，日内瓦协议在越南的实施正受到十分严重的破坏。南越政权至今拒绝履行协议中所规定的关于和平统一越南的政治条款。美国对越南的统一进行了种种阻挠，妄想把南越变成它的殖民地和军事基地，长期分裂越南。两国总理一致认为，参加1954年日内瓦会议的国家负有不可推卸的义务来制止这种发展，他们应该采取共同的有效措施，谋求日内瓦协议的彻底实现。
    两国总理特别注意到进一步巩固和发展两国之间的友谊的问题。两国总理满意地指出，中华人民共和国和越南民主共和国的关系日益密切，经济、文化交流和各种形式的接触往来日益扩大。在会谈中范文同总理指出中国对越南的技术援助的重要性。周恩来总理表示根据协定来到越南的中国技术人员应该学习越南人民勤劳朴素的作风，同越南人民共甘苦，努力工作，帮助越南人民进行建设。中国人民和越南人民有着共同的理想。两国人民坚决地、紧密地站在一起，反对殖民主义者的各种阴谋，维护亚洲和世界和平。中国将同过去一样努力支持越南人民进行经济建设和争取和平统一越南的斗争。中国和越南的牢不可破的友谊和兄弟般的合作，是保证日内瓦协议的实施和保障两国安全的重要因素。
    两国总理确认苏联政府1956年10月30日关于发展和进一步加强苏联同其他社会主义国家的友谊和合作的基础的宣言、中华人民共和国政府和越南民主共和国政府分别在1956年11月1日和11月6日关于这一宣言的声明的重要意义。两国总理坚决支持一切有助于增进社会主义国家相互关系和加强社会主义国家之间的团结的措施。两国总理保证，在他们两国的相互关系中和他们同其他国家的关系中，将严格遵守五项原则、坚决防止沙文主义的错误。
    两国总理深信，周恩来总理到越南民主共和国的访问和两国总理间的亲密会谈，将不仅有利于两国友好关系的进一步发展，而且也将有利于亚洲和世界的和平和安全。
                              1956年11月22日于河内
                  中华人民共和国国务院总理　周恩来
                  越南民主共和国政府总理　范文同
