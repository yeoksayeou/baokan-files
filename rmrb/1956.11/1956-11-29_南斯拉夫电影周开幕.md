Xinhua News Agency, November 28th: The first Yugoslav Film Week in China opened tonight at the Capital Cinema in Beijing. Yugoslav film artists met with over a thousand Chinese audience members at the opening ceremony.

    Yugoslav Ambassador to China, Popovic, then spoke. He said to the Chinese film audience: When you watch Yugoslav films, you will feel that the friendship between the Yugoslav and Chinese peoples is not accidental. We have a common goal—building socialism and safeguarding world peace. Our two peoples also have many things in common in the revolutionary struggle. Our friendship is eternal and unbreakable. This film week is another manifestation of the friendly cooperation between the two peoples.

He said that he had seen many Chinese films, and the things depicted in them had also happened in Yugoslavia. He expressed his belief that the holding of the Yugoslav Film Week in China and the showing of Chinese films in Yugoslavia will greatly help the further development of cultural exchanges between the two peoples.

    Film actress Julija Starič, the female lead in the film "Decision at Once," extended greetings to the Chinese audience on behalf of Yugoslav film workers who were unable to come to China.

    The audience repeatedly responded to the warm and friendly speeches of the Yugoslav friends with enthusiastic applause. Young Pioneers of China presented flowers to the Yugoslav film artists.
