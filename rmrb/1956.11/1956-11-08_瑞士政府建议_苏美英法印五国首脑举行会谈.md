Xinhua News Agency, November 7th, Bern dispatch: The Swiss government sent separate telegrams on the 6th to the heads of government of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, France, and India, as well as the Secretary-General of the United Nations, suggesting that the heads of government of the five countries hold a meeting to discuss the serious situation currently caused by the Middle East war.

The telegram stated, "The threat of a third world war and a new arms race, and all the tragic consequences they may entail, hang over humanity. But peace must and can be saved. With this in mind, the Swiss Federal Council (i.e., the Swiss government) issues an urgent appeal to the heads of government of the countries that held talks in Geneva in July 1955—the United States, France, Britain, and the Soviet Union—to hold talks immediately. The head of government of India may be allowed to attend their meeting as a representative of the Bandung Conference countries. This meeting could be held on Swiss territory. The Federal Council is willing to do its utmost to arrange such a meeting."
