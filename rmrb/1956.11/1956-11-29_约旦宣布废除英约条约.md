    Jordan Announces the Abolition of the Anglo-Jordanian Treaty

    On November 27th, Jordanian Prime Minister Nabulsi announced to Parliament that Jordan had decided to abolish the Anglo-Jordanian Treaty of Alliance and to withdraw British military bases from Jordan. This is another major step taken by Jordan to safeguard its national independence since the dismissal of Glubb Pasha, the British commander of the Arab Legion, in March of this year. This decision by the Jordanian government demonstrates Jordan's firm will to oppose colonialism and safeguard national sovereignty and independence.

    After Jordan declared its independence in 1946, Britain, in order to continue maintaining its colonial interests in Jordan, forced Jordan to sign the Anglo-Jordanian Twenty-Year Treaty of Alliance in 1948. The main terms of the treaty stipulated the establishment of a British-controlled "Anglo-Jordanian Joint Defense Committee" responsible for formulating Jordan's military strategic plans; stipulated that Britain had the right to occupy the two air force bases in Amman and Mafraq, the capital of Jordan, and had the right to station and train British troops on Jordanian territory; and stipulated that the Jordanian army was only allowed to use British weapons, ammunition, and equipment, and that in the event of war, both countries had an obligation to provide military "assistance." This treaty was, in effect, an instrument for Britain to continue to control and enslave Jordan politically and militarily, and it has always been strongly opposed by the Jordanian people.

    Therefore, Jordan's action to abolish the Anglo-Jordanian Treaty is entirely in line with Jordan's national interests. It will enable Jordan to finally get rid of the shackles of British colonialists and embark on the road of independent development.

    The Jordanian people have waged a long and heroic struggle against colonialist oppression. An important guarantee of its continuous new victories in the struggle is its firm implementation of the correct policy of unity with other Arab countries and mutual support in the struggle. Jordan's victorious struggle to expel British General Glubb in March of this year received the support of other Arab countries. It has also received the support of various Arab countries in its successive struggles to counter Israeli aggression on the border. When Jordan announced the abolition of the Anglo-Jordanian Treaty this time, Egypt, Syria, and Saudi Arabia all expressed their willingness to provide Jordan with financial assistance to compensate for the more than 20 million U.S. dollars in "aid" that Jordan received annually from Britain under the Anglo-Jordanian Treaty. Similarly, the Jordanian people have always actively supported the struggles of other Arab countries to defend their sovereignty and independence. Recently, the Jordanian people have always stood with the Egyptian people, resolutely opposing the aggression of Britain, France, and Israel, and Jordan's decision to abolish the Anglo-Jordanian Treaty is also a major support for the Egyptian people who are resisting Anglo-French aggression. This policy of unity and mutual support among Arab countries is an important factor in their victory in the anti-colonialist struggle.

    It is precisely because of this that the British and French colonialists are trying to split the unity between Arab countries in order to achieve their goal of defeating these countries one by one. Recently, with the support of the United States, Britain and France have been trying to use the oil issue to provoke relations between Iraq and Syria, creating new disputes in an attempt to interfere in Syria. Originally, Syria cut off the oil pipelines of the Iraqi Petroleum Company in order to support the Egyptian people's anti-aggression struggle, which was a completely just action. Of course, this will temporarily affect the income of the Iraqi government as a result. However, some losses of Iraqi oil revenues are only temporary, while opposing colonialism is a common long-term interest for all Arab countries. Therefore, it is necessary for all Arab countries to strengthen unity between countries and deal with common enemies for the sake of common long-term interests.

### 约旦宣布废除英约条约

    约旦宣布废除英约条约
    约旦首相纳布西在11月27日向议会宣布，约旦决定废除英—约同盟条约，撤销在约旦的英国军事基地。这是约旦继今年3月间解除阿拉伯军团英国司令格拉布以后维护民族独立的又一重大步骤，约旦政府这一决定，表明约旦反对殖民义主、维护国家主权和独立的坚定意志。
    在1946年约旦宣布独立后，英国为了继续保持它在约旦的殖民利益，曾在1948年压迫约旦签订了英—约二十年同盟条约。条约的主要条款规定成立一个受英国控制的“英—约联防委员会”，负责制定约旦的军事战略计划；规定英国有权占领约旦首都安曼和麦法拉克两个空军基地，有权在约旦领土上驻扎和训练英国军队；并规定约旦军队只许使用英国武器、弹药和装备，一旦发生战争，两国有义务提供军事“援助”。这个条约实际上是英国在政治上和军事上继续控制和奴役约旦的工具，它一直遭到约旦人民的强烈反对。
    因此，约旦宣布废除英约条约的行动，是完全符合约旦的民族利益的，它将使约旦最后摆脱英国殖民者的束缚，真正走上独立发展的道路。
    约旦人民为反对殖民主义的压迫，曾进行了长期的英勇斗争。它在斗争中不断取得新的胜利的一个重要保证，是它坚定地执行了同其它阿拉伯国家团结一致、互相支持进行斗争的正确政策。今年3月间约旦驱逐英国格拉布将军的胜利斗争，得到了其它阿拉伯国家的支持。它在历次反击以色列进犯边境的斗争中，也得到了各阿拉伯国家的支援。这次约旦宣布废除英约条约的时候，埃及、叙利亚和沙特阿拉伯都表示要给予约旦财政上的援助，以补偿约旦根据英约条约每年从英国取得的约二千多万美元的“援助”。同样，约旦人民也一向积极支持其它阿拉伯国家所进行的保卫主权和独立的斗争。最近，约旦人民始终同埃及人民站在一起，坚决反对英、法和以色列的侵略，而约旦决定废除英约条约，同样也是对正在反对英法侵略的埃及人民的一个重大的支持。阿拉伯国家这种团结一致、互相支援的政策，是它们取得反殖民主义斗争胜利的重要因素。
    正是因为这样，英法殖民主义者正力图分裂阿拉伯国家之间的团结，以达到它们对这些国家各个击破的目的。最近，英法在美国的支持之下，正想利用石油问题来挑拨伊拉克和叙利亚之间的关系，制造新的纠纷，企图借此对叙利亚进行干涉。本来叙利亚为了支持埃及人民的反侵略斗争，切断了伊拉克石油公司的油管，这是完全正义的行动。当然这也会因此暂时影响到伊拉克政府的收益。但是，伊拉克石油收入的某些损失只是暂时的，而反对殖民主义对一切阿拉伯国家来说，却是共同的长远利益。因此，一切阿拉伯国家有必要为了共同的长远利益，加强各国之间的团结，对付共同的敌人。
