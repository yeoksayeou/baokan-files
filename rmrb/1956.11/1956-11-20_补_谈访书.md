Supplement to "Talking About Book Hunting"
    Xie Chaolun
    I very much agree with Comrade Xidi's suggestion in his article "Talking About Book Hunting" to establish several "book hunting work groups" to conduct a general interview and inventory of important ancient books throughout the country.

    As everyone knows, the precious books of our motherland have been truly "few and far between" due to the ravages of successive wars and the plunder of imperialism. If we do not pay attention to excavating and preserving even these scarce remnants, then our history will be cut off. Isn't this an extremely serious problem?!

    However, it is incomprehensible that the arbitrary destruction of ancient books is not limited to those introduced by Comrade Xidi. Let me just give a few examples below and put forward a few suggestions as a supplement to the article "Talking About Book Hunting":

    I heard that Haihui Temple in Fudong Township, Binhu District, Yixing, Jiangsu Province, has a very good palace-edition Tripitaka (given to the temple by Empress Dowager Cixi of the late Qing Dynasty). At the beginning of this month, I invited a friend, took a day's car ride, went hungry for half a day, and traveled forty miles of mountain road to visit. Who knew that it would have been better not to see it, because seeing it was really heartbreaking: a perfectly good Tripitaka had actually become more than a foot thick of white pulp. According to the old monk of the temple: In the first half of last year, this Tripitaka was still completely preserved in the Tripitaka Building, but in the second half of the year, several village cadres suddenly opened the door. Some took a few copies to paste windows, some took a few copies to paste walls, some only took away the camphor wood splints of the Tripitaka, and some tore it into pieces without any awareness. More than 8,000 volumes of Tripitaka were sacrificed for no reason. Shouldn't the local government be responsible for such a waste of national property?

    There is a book collector named Xu (a landlord) in Beimen, Yixing. His family's collection of books began in the Ming Dynasty and has been increasing year by year, totaling more than 30,000 volumes, including many Song and Ming dynasty fine editions. Almost all the county chronicles of Jiangsu Province are available. However, all the books were lost during the land reform. Where these books have scattered to should be found.

    Comrade Chen of the Shanghai Old Bookstore told me that he heard that a unit in Qingpu County kept a large number of woodblock books, so he took a letter of introduction to learn about the situation and wanted to make some suggestions on preservation and handling. The comrade who received him in that unit not only did not support him, but also thought that "it was not necessary."

    In the first half of this year, a review of reactionary, pornographic, and absurd books and periodicals was conducted, mainly targeting the novel rental industry and the second-hand book distribution industry. However, some places indiscriminately demanded books upon seeing them, and even ordinary books such as Zizhi Tongjian and Tang Poetry Collection were confiscated (this was told to me by a primary school teacher in Zhangzhu Town, Yixing). I think this is inappropriate.

    At present, there are waste recycling stations in various places, and old books and waste paper are also part of the recycling business. Some places pack and send the old books and waste paper they receive to factories for recycling without checking them. What if there is reference material in them? I think this loophole should also be plugged.

    I think the above situations are all worthy of attention. In order to prevent the cultural relics and books of the motherland from being damaged again, I hope that the work of the "book hunting team" will start as soon as possible.

### 补“谈访书”

    补“谈访书”
    谢朝仑
    西谛同志在“谈访书”一文里，主张成立几个“访书工作团”，在全国各地对重要古籍进行一次总的采访和清查，这一主张我是非常赞同的。
    谁都知道，祖国的珍贵图籍，在历代战争的摧残下，在帝国主义的掠夺下，真是“所余无几”了。假使连这稀少的残余，还不注意发掘和保存，那我们的历史就将被割断。这难道不是极其严重的问题么！？
    可是令人无法理解，任意糟蹋古籍的情况，却不只西谛同志所介绍的那一些。下面让我随便举几个例，并提出几点意见来作为“谈访书”一文的补充吧：
    我听说江苏宜兴滨湖区福东乡海会寺有一部很好的殿板大藏经，（是晚清慈禧后送给该寺的）本月初我就约了一个朋友，坐了一天汽车，饿了半天肚皮，跑了四十里山路，前往参观。那知不看还好，看了实在伤心：一部好好的大藏经，竟成了一尺多厚的白色纸浆。据该寺老僧谈：去年上半年这部藏经还很完整地保存在藏经楼，下半年忽然被几个乡村干部将门打开，有的拿了几本糊窗子，有的拿了几本糊墙壁，有的只拿走了藏经的香樟夹板，有的却毫无意识地将它扯成碎片，八千多卷藏经就这样无缘无故牺牲了。这样的糟蹋祖国财产，难道当地政府不应该负责么？
    宜兴北门有一个姓徐的（地主）藏书家，他家藏书是从明朝开始搜集的，逐年都有增加，总数在三万卷以上，其中宋版、明版善本也不少。江苏省的县志差不多都有。但在土地改革期间全部藏书都散失了。这些藏书究竟散到什么地方去了，是应该找一找的。
    上海旧书商店有位陈同志告诉我，他听说青浦县某单位保管有大批木版书，他就带了介绍信，想去了解一些情况，并想提出一些保管和处理的意见。那个单位的接见同志，不但不予赞助，反而爱理不理地认为“无此必要”。
    今年上半年，对于反动、黄色、荒诞的书刊，曾进行过一次清查，主要的对象本是小说租赁业和旧书发行业。可是有些地方却不分青红皂白地见书便要，甚至连资治通鉴、唐诗合解这样普通的书都被收缴了（这是宜兴张渚镇一个小学教师告诉我的）。我以为这是不妥当的。
    目前各地都有废品收购站，旧书废纸也是收购业务之一。有些地方收到的旧书废纸，不加检查便打包送厂回炉了。假使其中有足供参考的资料，怎么办呢？我觉得这样的漏洞也是应该堵塞的。
    以上这些情况，我认为都是值得注意的。为了使祖国的文物、图籍，不再遭受到毁坏，我希望“访书团”的工作早日开始。
