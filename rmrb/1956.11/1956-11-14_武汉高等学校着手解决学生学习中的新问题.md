Xinhua News Agency News: Wuhan's universities are beginning to address problems such as students' inability to make good use of their spare time and allowing their studies to become undisciplined.
    Wuhan University's Academic Committee recently held a meeting to study these new problems and proposed further implementation of the policy of "all-round development, teaching according to aptitude" to cultivate students' ability to think and work independently. As early as the beginning of October, the Deputy Secretary of the Party Branch of Wuhan Institute of Water Conservancy explained to the students how to correctly handle the relationship between the individual and the collective, democracy and centralism, and freedom and discipline, which was of great help to students' studies and lives. Wuhan Institute of Geodesy and Geophysics, while solving the problem of students' excessive academic burden, also gave students reports on study discipline. In the journals published by Huazhong Institute of Technology, Huazhong Agricultural College, and Central China Normal College, students often engage in debates with differing opinions. The journal of Huazhong Institute of Technology has opened a column "Do you agree with free time allocation? How to allocate it?" and students have written articles expressing their desire to be masters of their own time; some students have introduced their experiences in arranging their time. The Communist Youth League organization of Wuhan Institute of Water Conservancy invited teachers who had studied in the Soviet Union to introduce Soviet university students' studies and lives to the students.
    The libraries, reading rooms, and study rooms of various schools have generally extended their opening hours and greatly increased the types and quantities of new books and periodicals to improve students' learning conditions.

    武汉高等学校着手解决学生学习中的新问题
    新华社讯　武汉地区的高等学校着手解决学生中不善于利用课余时间和学习放任自流等的问题。
    武汉大学学术委员会最近开会研究了这些新问题，并提出进一步贯彻“全面发展、因材施教”的方针，培养学生独立思考和独立工作能力的意见。武汉水利学院早在10月初就由党总支副书记向学生讲解了怎样正确地处理个人与集体、民主与集中、自由与纪律的关系，对学生的学习和生活帮助很大。武汉测量制图学院在解决学生课业负担过重问题的同时，还向学生作了有关学习纪律的报告。华中工学院、华中农学院、华中师范学院等院校出版的院刊上，经常有学生展开不同意见的争论。华中工学院院刊开辟了“你赞成自由支配时间吗？如何支配？”的专栏，学生们都写文章表示要作时间的主人；有的学生介绍了自己安排时间的经验。武汉水利学院青年团组织请这个学校曾经去苏联留学的教员向学生们介绍了苏联大学生的学习和生活。
    各校图书馆、阅览室、自习室普遍延长了开放时间，并大力增加新书、期刊的种类和数量，以改善学生的学习条件。
