Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 11th: According to TASS, "Pravda" published an article by Vishnevsky on the 10th, exposing the atrocities of Hungarian counter-revolutionaries.

The article said that while the American "lie factory" was working at full capacity, attempting to whitewash the crimes of the fascist Horthy criminals in Hungary, some American newspaper reporters could not help but reveal the rampant activities of the fascist bandits who attempted to overthrow the Hungarian people's democratic system through white terror.

Homer Bigart, a special correspondent for the "New York Times," wrote in an article on October 29, describing the barbaric persecution of honest Hungarian citizens by fascist elements in Magyaróvár, that one patriot captured by the bandits "was thrown into the middle of the street and trampled." Another patriot, wounded by the thugs, "was dragged out of the hospital yesterday morning. According to witnesses, he was hung up by his feet; when he was taken down from the rope, he was dead, and his body was trampled by the thugs." A third patriot jumped out of a window and escaped capture, but the thugs caught him in the street and "stomped on him mercilessly."

American newspapers and magazines are full of descriptions of such bloody atrocities. A dispatch from Budapest in the "New York Times" on October 31 said that a Hungarian military officer "was captured and hung on a lamppost." The next day, a dispatch in the same newspaper said that people who supported the people's government "were being murdered everywhere."

Vishnevsky said that the recent Hungarian tragedy was the work of the mortal enemies of the Hungarian working people. Even Schwartz, a not-so-famous observer for the "New York Times," which is by no means sympathetic to communism, attested to this in his article on the class composition of the rebels. When Schwartz talked about the class composition of the rebels, he first called them "the remnants of the overthrown classes." These remnants included expropriated wealthy people, former landlords and rich peasants, and suppressed clerical factions, among others. According to the American reporter, these are the people who are being vigorously praised by the reactionaries in the United States, Britain, and France.

### 苏联“真理报”载文  揭露匈牙利反革命分子的暴行

    苏联“真理报”载文
    揭露匈牙利反革命分子的暴行
    据新华社11日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：“真理报”10日刊载了维什涅夫斯基的一篇文章，揭露匈牙利反革命分子的暴行。
    文章说，就在美国的“谎话制造厂”开足马力工作，企图为匈牙利法西斯霍尔蒂罪犯洗刷罪名的时候，某些美国报刊的记者也情不自禁地说出了企图靠白色恐怖来推翻匈牙利人民民主制度的法西斯匪徒的猖狂活动情况。
    “纽约时报”的特派记者霍默·比加特10月29日在一篇文章中描写法西斯分子在马吉亚罗瓦尔野蛮地迫害正直的匈牙利公民的时候写道，有一个被匪徒捉住的爱国者，“他被丢在街心，他被践踏”。另一个被暴徒击伤的爱国者“在昨天早晨被从医院拖出来。据目击者说，他被拴住脚吊起来；把他从绳子上解下来时，他气绝了，他的尸体被匪徒们践踏”。第三个爱国者，跳窗而出，逃脱了追捕，但是匪徒们却在街上捉住了他，“狠命地踩他”。
    在美国报纸和杂志上有的是这种血腥暴行的描写。10月31日“纽约时报”刊载的布达佩斯消息说，有一个匈牙利军官“被捉住吊在路灯柱子上”。第二天这家报纸刊载的消息又说，拥护人民政权的人“到处受到杀害”。
    维什涅夫斯基说，最近的匈牙利悲剧，是匈牙利劳动人民的死敌所干的勾当。甚至绝不是同情共产主义的“纽约时报”不无名声的观察家施瓦次的文章中也证明了这一点。施瓦次谈到叛乱分子的阶级成分的时候，首先把他们称作“被推翻的阶级的残余”。这些残余中有被剥夺了的阔人、以前的地主和富农以及被镇压的教权派等。照美国记者说，这些人就是受到美国、英国和法国反动分子所竭力赞扬的人。
