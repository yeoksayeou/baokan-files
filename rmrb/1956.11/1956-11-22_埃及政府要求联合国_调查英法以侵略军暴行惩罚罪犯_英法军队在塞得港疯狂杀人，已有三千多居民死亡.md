    Xinhua News Agency, November 21st dispatch from Cairo: Cairo Radio broadcast an Egyptian government statement on the 20th requesting the United Nations to investigate the atrocities of the Anglo-French aggressor forces in Port Said and the atrocities of Israel against refugees.

    It also requested the establishment of an international commission of inquiry for this purpose to punish the criminals responsible for these atrocities.

    Cairo Radio said that the statement had been sent to UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld and distributed to various delegations.

    The statement said that before the Anglo-French invasion of Port Said on November 5, they continuously carried out air strikes, causing significant damage to the city with a population of 150,000 Egyptians. The statement cited Anglo-French military figures as saying that 500 sorties were flown against Port Said on the day of the invasion. The statement also pointed out that the invading forces tried every means to force Egyptian workers to cooperate with them. When the residents of Port Said refused to cooperate, savage measures were taken against them.

    The statement pointed out that in Port Said, the Anglo-French troops imposed a curfew and opened fire on women and children, forcing people to work under armed threat. In Rafah, El Arish, and Gaza, Israeli troops took retaliatory actions against the residents, and a large number of Arab refugees were killed in Gaza, with more than 50 killed in one instance. "The Egyptian government has obtained photos and films showing the actions of the British and French in Port Said and has handed them over to the United Nations Organization so that delegations from various countries know about these violations of human rights."

    The statement said: "We request the United Nations and its appropriate committees, in cooperation with the International Committee of the Red Cross and the Human Rights Commission, to establish a committee to investigate the impact of the barbaric aggression against Egypt and Gaza." The statement said: Egypt demands "punishment of the aggressors, who must be held responsible for the aggression they have committed."

    The statement said, "The events that have occurred from the Israeli invasion of the Sinai Peninsula on October 29, 1956, to this day, prove that Egypt was, and still is, the target of a multilateral conspiracy in which the main countries are Britain and France, colluding with Israel to realize their aggressive plot."

    The Egyptian government's statement also accused Britain and France of violating the 1888 Constantinople Convention, according to which the freedom of navigation of the Suez Canal should be maintained and the canal itself should not be exposed to military action. The statement pointed out, however, that the Anglo-French military action had brought the navigation of the canal to a standstill, causing damage to the economic interests of various countries.

    The statement also refuted the so-called "secret deal" between Egypt and the Soviet Union, as put forward by some political figures in the two aggressor nations, Britain and France. The statement pointed out that they were trying to mislead world public opinion with such accusations and justify the actions they had taken.

    Xinhua News Agency, November 20th dispatch from Cairo, TASS: On the orders of President Nasser, investigation committees are being established in various provinces of Egypt to investigate the losses caused to Egyptian residents by the aggression of Britain, France, and Israel. The Governor of Cairo Province, Bendari, has organized five such committees.

    The Central Committee, chaired by the Minister of Social Affairs and Labor, Shafei, will synthesize the materials collected from various places.

    Xinhua News Agency, November 21st dispatch from Beirut, TASS: News received here says that as a result of the Anglo-French invasion of Port Said, more than three thousand peaceful residents have died, most of whom are women and children. The densely populated Arab residential areas of Tamir, Abbasa Street, and other streets in the city have been bombed into rubble. If the Anglo-French troops discovered that someone was shooting from a house, they would immediately drive all the residents into the street and burn the house down. Low-flying planes strafed crowds gathered in the streets. British soldiers raped the daughter of a prominent merchant in the city.

    Egyptian patriots in the Anglo-French occupied areas resolutely refuse to cooperate with the interventionist troops. Almost all the residents of Port Fouad have fled the city. The Anglo-French troops have carried out crazy repression against the local residents, and they have shot and killed Egyptians who refused to work for them.

    In order to prevent the residents of Port Said from hearing news about the support of the people of Egypt for the people of Port Said, the British have begun to interfere with the broadcasts of Cairo Radio.

    埃及政府要求联合国
    调查英法以侵略军暴行惩罚罪犯
    英法军队在塞得港疯狂杀人，已有三千多居民死亡
    新华社21日讯　开罗消息：开罗电台在20日广播的一篇埃及政府声明中要求联合国调查英法侵略军在塞得港的暴行，以及以色列对难民的暴行。
    它还要求为了这个目的成立一个国际调查委员会，以便惩罚应对这些暴行负责的罪犯。
    开罗电台说，这篇声明已经送给联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德，并且分发给了各国代表团。
    声明说，英法在11月5日进攻塞得港以前就不断地进行空袭，使这个有十五万埃及人口的城市受到了重大的损失。声明援引英法军方数字说，在进攻那一天对塞得港出动飞机五百架次。声明并且指出，侵略军千方百计地迫使埃及工人同他们合作，塞得港居民拒绝和他们合作，于是就引起了对他们采取野蛮措施。
    声明指出，在塞得港，英法军队实行了宵禁，并且开枪射击妇女和儿童，强迫人民在武装的威胁下工作。在拉法、埃尔阿里希和加沙，以色列军对居民采取报复行动，大批的阿拉伯难民在加沙被他们杀害，一次就杀害五十多人。“埃及政府得到了表明英法在塞得港的所作所为的照片和影片，并且把这些照片和影片交给联合国组织，使各国代表团知道这种违反人权的暴行。”
    声明说：“我们要求联合国和它的适当的委员会在红十字国际委员会和人权委员会的合作下成立一个委员会，以便调查对埃及和加沙所进行的野蛮侵略所造成的影响。”声明说：埃及要求“惩罚侵略者，侵略者必须对他们所进行的侵略负责”。
    声明说，“从1956年10月29日以色列进攻西奈半岛起到今天为止所发生的事件，证明埃及过去是、现在仍然是多边阴谋的目标，在这种阴谋中，主要的国家是同以色列勾结一起以实现侵略阴谋的英国和法国。”
    埃及政府的声明还指责英法两国违背了1888年的君士坦丁堡公约，根据那项公约的条款，应该维持苏伊士运河的通航自由，而且不应该使运河本身暴露在军事行动之下。声明指出，但是英法的军事行动已经使运河的航行陷于停顿，使各国的经济利益遭受了损害。
    声明也驳斥了英法两个侵略国的一些政界人物所提出的所谓埃及同苏联有“秘密交易”的说法。声明指出，这是他们企图以这种指责迷惑世界舆论，为自己所采取的行动进行辩解。
    新华社20日讯　据塔斯社开罗19日讯：奉纳赛尔总统的命令，埃及国内各省都在建立调查委员会，调查英、法和以色列的侵略给埃及居民所造成的损失。开罗省长本达里组织了五个这样的委员会。
    社会事务与劳工部长沙菲主持的中央委员会将综合各地收集的材料。
    新华社21日讯　据塔斯社贝鲁特20日讯：这里得到的消息说，英法军队侵入塞得港的结果，有三千多名和平居民死亡，其中大部分是妇孺。市内人口密集的阿拉伯人居住区塔米尔、阿巴萨大街和其他街道已经被炸成一片瓦砾场。如果英法军队发现，哪所房子里有人开枪射击，他们立刻就把里面的居民全赶到大街上，把房子烧掉。低空飞行的飞机向聚集在街上的人群扫射。英国兵强奸了市内一个著名的商人的女儿。
    在英法军队占领区的埃及爱国者坚决拒绝同干涉军合作。福德港的居民几乎全部逃出了这个城市。英法军队对当地居民进行了疯狂的镇压，他们枪杀拒绝为他们工作的埃及人。
    为了使塞得港居民听不到关于埃及全国人民对塞得港人民支持的消息，英国人开始干扰开罗电台的广播。
