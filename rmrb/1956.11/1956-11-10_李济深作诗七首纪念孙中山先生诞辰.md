Xinhua News Agency, 9th - Li Jishen, Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, composed seven poems on the eve of the ninetieth anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's birth to express his commemoration.

    (1)
    The republican ideal has deeply penetrated people's hearts, eradicating the roots of thousands of years of imperial rule. How laughable that Yuan (Shikai) and Zhang (Xun) attempted a restoration, only to turn to dust in an instant.
    (2)
    Although the imperial system was eliminated, warlords rose, with ten years of division and military conflict. At that time, the revolutionary tide was extremely low, yet the fighting lone army never ceased.
    (3)
    The sound of the October Revolution cannons resounded, recognized as the great savior of the people. The revolution should model itself after the Russian example; otherwise, the revolution will not succeed.
    (4)
    Alliance with Russia, alliance with the Communist Party, emphasizing workers and peasants, policies were new and victories were in sight. Who could have imagined that a great star would suddenly fall, heartbreakingly turning the revolution to nothing once more.
    (5)
    Fortunately, the Communist Party persevered, a single pillar supporting the grand edifice. Twenty years of arduous struggle, turning danger and peril into peace.
    (6)
    Seven years of victory, how brilliant, internationally acclaimed as great and strong. Unity of purpose writing history, there is not half a word of exaggeration.
    (7)
    The land awaits consolidation and the realm made secure. The KMT and the CPC should restore their former friendship. Relatives and friends are all hopeful, return and join hands to build great plans.

    李济深作诗七首纪念孙中山先生诞辰
    新华社9日讯　中国国民党革命委员会主席李济深在孙中山先生诞辰九十周年前夕作诗七首，表示纪念。
    （一）
    共和思想入人深，铲净千年帝制根，可笑袁（世凯）张（勋）图一试，却教旋踵化灰尘。
    （二）
    帝制虽除军阀兴，十年割据事兵争，是时革命潮低甚，奋斗孤军总不停。
    （三）
    十月革命炮声鸣，认是人群大救星，革命应师俄榜样，不然革命事无成。
    （四）
    联俄联共重工农，政策方新胜利中，岂意大星忽陨落，痛心革命又成空。
    （五）
    幸由共产党坚持，一柱擎天大厦支，奋斗廿年艰苦甚，危亡凶险化平夷。
    （六）
    七年胜利几辉煌，国际同称大且强，团结一心空历史，并无半句话夸张。
    （七）
    江山待整金瓯固，国共还应旧好修，亲友人人都在望，归来携手建宏猷。
