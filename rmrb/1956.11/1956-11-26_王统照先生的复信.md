    Mr. Wang Tongzhao's Reply Letter
    Having read your letter detailing how you dedicated the now-photographically reproduced upper half of the "Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio Manuscript" to the government, I am exceedingly gratified! I believe this is something that all those concerned with Mr. Pu Songling's works would be glad to know.

    For over thirty years, you have safeguarded this upper half of the original manuscript within your family's collection, protecting it from loss or forced seizure during the enemy and puppet regime period, and finally bringing it to light. This is not only your "good fortune," but your love and respect for your ancestor's precious manuscript is also worthy of everyone's gratitude!　Wang Tongzhao

    王统照先生的复信
    读过您这封如何把现已影印的上半部“聊斋志异原稿”献于政府的经过，至为欣慰！我想这也是关心蒲松龄先生著作的同愿闻知的。
    您从家传的保管中，卫护这上半部原稿三十多年，没在敌伪时期失落或被迫夺，终于与世相见，这不但是您的“幸运”，而您对于先人的宝贵手稿的爱重也值得大家感谢！　王统照
