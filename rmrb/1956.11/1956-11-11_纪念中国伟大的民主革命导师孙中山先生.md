Today, on the ninetieth anniversary of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's birth, we commemorate this great leader of the Chinese democratic revolution with reverence.

Mr. Sun Yat-sen dedicated himself to the revolutionary cause from the end of the 19th century, organizing revolutionary groups and leading revolutionary uprisings, and was admired by all patriots. Since the 20th century, imperialists have intensified their political, economic, and cultural aggression against our country, and the Qing government has also strengthened its reliance on imperialism to maintain its feudal rule. The country was on the verge of peril, and the people suffered greatly. All patriots demanded revolution to save the nation. In 1905, Mr. Sun Yat-sen united many revolutionary groups and patriotic people to form the Tongmenghui (Revolutionary Alliance). Tongmenghui members established revolutionary groups in various places, united patriotic people, and prepared for revolutionary uprisings, becoming the organizers and leaders of the national people's revolutionary movement.

The Xinhai Revolution was launched under the call and leadership of Mr. Sun Yat-sen. With the Tongmenghui as the center, the united front combined all anti-Qing forces, and its success promoted the victory of the revolution. From the beginning, the Tongmenghui paid attention to armed struggle, and the revolutionaries used military force to disintegrate the old armies, such as the Green Standard Army and the patrol battalions. At that time, the uprising army paid attention to maintaining military discipline and not disturbing the people, but they did not know how to mobilize the masses. Tongmenghui members were enthusiastic about the revolution and worked hard for armed uprisings, but they did not realize that they should pay attention to revolutionary ideological education. Therefore, after the Xinhai Revolution, the Qing emperor was overthrown, and a republic was formally established. Many people relaxed, thinking that the revolution had succeeded, and did not think about further organizing revolutionary forces to fight against the old forces. The counter-revolutionary forces, led by Yuan Shikai, seized the opportunity to attack the revolution, and after 1913, they controlled the whole country.

In 1917, the Russian October Socialist Revolution won victory, and Mr. Sun Yat-sen was the first to send a telegram of congratulations. In 1921, he decided to ally with Russia. In January 1922, Mr. Sun Yat-sen said in a speech to the Yunnan-Guangdong-Jiangxi armies: "The Russian revolution happened after ours, but its achievements are better than ours... Their soldiers all have doctrines and purposes, so they can unite with farmers and workers to transform the new country." He pointed out that the Chinese revolution should learn from the Soviet Union.

Mr. Sun Yat-sen fought heroically for China's national independence for forty years, realizing that imperialist countries would never help the Chinese revolution (some individual foreigners did help), and only socialist countries would support the Chinese revolution. In November 1923, Mr. Sun Yat-sen wrote on a letter from Deng Zeru and others: "Our revolution has always been unwelcome to various countries, so they often help those who oppose me to extinguish our party. Therefore, capitalist countries will never express sympathy for our party. The only ones who can be expected to sympathize are Russia and the oppressed countries and oppressed people." Mr. Sun Yat-sen's nationalism combined with Lenin's socialism. In January 1924, he reorganized the Kuomintang (Nationalist Party of China), convened the First National Congress of the Kuomintang, and established the three major policies of alliance with Russia, alliance with the Communist Party, and assistance to farmers and workers. The Kuomintang and the Communist Party of China formed a united front to jointly strive to achieve the revolutionary program stipulated in the declaration of the First National Congress of the Kuomintang.

After Mr. Sun Yat-sen cooperated with the Communist Party of China, the face of the Chinese revolution took on a new look. Although the revolution of 1925-27 failed, it left a profound impact on the people of the whole country. The Chinese revolution continued to develop under new conditions and finally achieved nationwide victory in 1949. We must not forget Mr. Sun Yat-sen's great role in the history of the Chinese revolution.

Mr. Sun Yat-sen fully demonstrated his firm and courageous revolutionary spirit in forty years of revolutionary struggle. He was not afraid of difficulties and failures. After suffering setbacks, he reorganized the revolutionary ranks and returned to the battlefield. Mr. Sun Yat-sen was able to continuously progress with the development of historical events, from advocating the overthrow of the Qing emperor and the establishment of a republic in his early years to proposing the three major policies of alliance with Russia, alliance with the Communist Party, and assistance to farmers and workers in his later years, and from advocating democratic revolution to advocating the realization of world harmony. Throughout Mr. Sun Yat-sen's life, his revolutionary spirit was always advancing.

Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese people inherited and carried forward Mr. Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary cause. After nearly thirty years of efforts, they first completed the first stage of the revolution, namely, the bourgeois democratic revolution. In terms of national issues, China, except for Taiwan, has been completely liberated from imperialist oppression, and all ethnic groups in China have also achieved equal rights. In terms of civil rights, the principle of democratic rights "shared by the general common people" has been realized. All individuals and groups that truly oppose imperialism are entitled to all freedoms and rights. In terms of people's livelihood, in the stage of the bourgeois democratic revolution, the program of land to the tillers and private capital not being able to manipulate the national economy has also been realized. All the national and democratic revolutionary ideals that Mr. Sun Yat-sen passionately pursued throughout his life have been fully realized by the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people united in the first stage of the revolution. For the past few years, the Communist Party of China and the people of the whole country have been working hard to complete the second stage of the revolution, namely, building a socialist motherland. So far, decisive victories have been achieved in the cause of socialist transformation.

Our people have achieved revolutionary victory and cannot forget Mr. Sun Yat-sen and all the revolutionary martyrs of the past. Our commemoration of Mr. Sun Yat-sen, the great leader of the democratic revolution, can inspire us to move forward to the new socialist cause.

    纪念中国伟大的民主革命导师孙中山先生
    朱德
    孙中山先生诞辰九十周年的今天，我们以尊敬的心情来纪念这位伟大的中国民主革命的导师。
    孙中山先生从十九世纪末期就献身于革命事业，组织革命团体，领导革命起义，为一切爱国人士所景仰。二十世纪以来，帝国主义者更加强了对我国政治的、经济的、文化的侵略，清朝政府也更加强了对帝国主义的依靠，借以维持其封建统治。国家濒于危亡，人民生活痛苦，爱国人士莫不为救亡而要求革命。孙中山先生于1905年联合许多革命团体和爱国志士组织同盟会。同盟会会员分头在各地建立革命团体，联合爱国人士，准备革命起义，成为全国人民革命运动的组织者和领导者。
    辛亥革命是在孙中山先生号召和领导之下发动的。以同盟会为中心，联合一切反清的力量，统一战线的成功，就促成了革命的胜利。同盟会一开始就注意武装斗争，革命党利用军事力量瓦解了绿营、巡防营等旧军队。那时起义的军队注意了维持军队的纪律，不去扰害百姓，但是并不知道发动群众。同盟会会员热心于革命、努力于武装起义，但是并不知道应该注意革命的思想教育。因此在辛亥革命以后，清朝皇帝打倒了，形式上的民国成立了，许多人松了劲，以为革命已经成功，没有想到进一步地组织革命力量，同旧势力作斗争。而以袁世凯为首的反革命势力，乘机向革命进攻，1913年以后便控制了全国。
    1917年俄国十月社会主义革命胜利，孙中山先生首先致电祝贺，1921年就决定联俄。1922年1月孙中山先生对滇粤赣军讲演说：“俄国革命发生，尚在我后，其成绩较我为优……其军人皆有主义、有目的，故能与农工联合而改造新国家。”指出中国革命要学苏联。
    孙中山先生为中国民族独立，英勇地斗争了四十年，认识到帝国主义国家绝不会帮助中国革命（个别外国人士的帮助是有的），只有社会主义国家才会支持中国革命。1923年11月孙中山先生在邓泽如等人的信上批道：“我们革命向为各国所不乐闻，故常助反对我者以扑灭吾党。故资本国家断无表同情于吾党。所望为同情，只有俄国及受屈之国家受屈之人民耳。”孙中山先生的民族主义和列宁的社会主义相结合，1924年1月改组中国国民党，召开国民党第一次全国代表大会，确定了联俄、联共、扶助农工三大政策。中国国民党和中国共产党组成了统一战线，为实现中国国民党第一次全国代表大会宣言所规定的革命纲领而共同奋斗。
    孙中山先生同中国共产党合作以后，中国革命的面貌就为之一新。1925至27年的革命虽然失败了，但是给全国人民留下了深刻的影响。中国革命在新的条件下继续发展，终于在1949年获得全国范围的胜利。饮水思源：我们不能不纪念孙中山先生在中国革命史上的伟大作用。
    孙中山先生在四十年的革命斗争中充分的表现了坚决和勇敢的革命精神，他不怕困难和失败，他在遭受失败后，又整顿好革命队伍，重新走上战场。孙中山先生能够随着历史事变的发展不断的进步，由早期的主张推翻清朝皇帝、建立民国而进到晚年的提出联俄、联共、扶助农工的三大政策，由倡导民主革命而进到主张实现世界大同。在孙中山先生的一生中，他的革命精神永远是在前进的。
    中国人民在中国共产党领导之下继承并发扬了孙中山先生的革命事业。经过近三十年的努力，首先完成了革命的第一阶段，即资产阶级民主革命阶段。在民族问题方面，中国除台湾外，已经从帝国主义压迫下得到完全的解放；中国境内各民族也得到一律平等。在民权问题方面，实现了民主权利“为一般平民所共有”的原则，凡真正反对帝国主义之个人及团体，均得享有一切自由及权利。在民生问题方面，在资产阶级民主革命阶段，也实现了耕者有其田和私人资本不能操纵国民经济的纲领。凡孙中山先生一生热烈追求的民族、民主革命的理想，中国共产党和中国人民团结在一起，在革命的第一阶段中充分地实现了。中国共产党和全国人民几年来为完成革命的第二阶段，即建设社会主义的祖国而努力。到目前为止，在社会主义改造事业方面也已经获得了决定性的胜利。
    我国人民取得了革命的胜利，不能够忘记孙中山先生和过去一切革命的先烈。我们纪念伟大的民主革命导师孙中山先生，正可以吸取向社会主义新事业前进的鼓舞力量。
