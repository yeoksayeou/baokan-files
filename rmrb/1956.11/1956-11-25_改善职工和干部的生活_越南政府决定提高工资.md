Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, November 24th. The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has decided to raise wages to improve the lives of workers, cadres, and military personnel.

    Nguyen Van Tao, Minister of Labor of the Vietnamese government, announced at a recent meeting convened by the Ministry of Labor, the Ministry of Interior, and other departments to discuss the implementation of the October resolution of the Council of Ministers regarding the improvement of the lives of cadres, workers, and military personnel, that the wages of all cadres and workers would be increased by 5% from October 1st; an increase of 8% to 12% would be applied in Hanoi, Haiphong, and other areas with concentrated populations and higher prices; and the original regional subsidies would continue to be paid. The wages of workers with lower original salaries and demobilized soldiers have also been adjusted. Workers working on construction sites will receive a wage increase of 11% to 25% compared to the past, and their back pay will be calculated from July 1, 1955.

    Subsidies for cadres, workers, and military personnel have also been appropriately increased based on varying conditions such as harsh climate and difficulties in supply.

    Southern cadres who are working or recuperating, and who have not previously received enough or currently lack winter clothing, blankets, and mosquito nets, can apply to the relevant departments for supplements. In addition, the government has allocated rice to subsidize poor workers and cadres' families with many children. According to newspaper reports, the Vietnamese government has already allocated 1,500 tons of rice for this purpose not long ago.

    改善职工和干部的生活
    越南政府决定提高工资
    新华社河内24日电　越南民主共和国政府已经决定提高工资，以改善职工、干部和军人的生活。
    越南政府劳动部部长阮文造在最近劳动部、内务部等部门召开的讨论执行10月间部长会议关于改善干部、职工和军队人员生活的决议的会议上宣布，所有干部、职工的工资从10月1日起提高5％；人口集中和物价较高的河内、海防等地区增加8％到12％；原有的地区补助费照发。原薪较低的职工、转业军人的工资也得到了调整。在工地工作的职工，工资比过去增加11％到25％，他们补发的工资将从1955年7月1日算起。
    干部、职工和军人的补助金根据气候恶劣、供应困难等不同情况也有适当的提高。
    正在工作和休养的南方干部，凡是以前尚未领足和现在缺乏冬衣、被子、帐子的，可向有关部门补领。此外，政府还拨出大米来补助贫困的和多子女的职工和干部的家庭。据报纸消息，越南政府为此在不久以前已经拨出了一千五百吨大米。
