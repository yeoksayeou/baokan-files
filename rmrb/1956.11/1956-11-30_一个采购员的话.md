    A Word from a Purchasing Agent

    I am a purchasing agent, and in this fourth quarter, I want to say a few words to the Party and the people. Usually, I don't find the purchasing work difficult, but every fourth quarter, I feel a bit overwhelmed. The reason is: once it reaches the end of the year, under the instructions of the leaders, we have to buy a large number of things, and the money spent is really too much. I remember at the end of 1952, our leaders held a "money-spending meeting," and the evaluation of our work was based on whether we could spend money. Spending more money was considered completing the task, and if the money couldn't be spent, that would naturally be considered a lack of initiative in the work. Why spend so much money? It is said that there are several reasons:

    First, if the year's budget is not spent, and it is turned over, it is said that it will be difficult to make a budget again next year. Clearly, even if we should do that much, it won't be approved that much, and the work will be difficult...

    Second, the remaining money is what everyone has saved, and it is not easy! If it is handed over, wouldn't all the hard work of the year be in vain? Now that we have money, we should enjoy it.

    Third, for some foreign orders, some goods will only be delivered next year, and payment will also be made next year. If this money is spent now, and payment is made next year, we can make next year's budget again.

    I don't understand what these principles are. Why do they use such a black heart to deal with the national financial authorities? Isn't the money they spend the blood and sweat of the people? I hope that the leading comrades of the Party and the government will, at this time, visit the market, the transportation and electrical equipment company, the hardware company, the sofa store, and the radio shop, and talk to those purchasing agents who are running around in a sweat, listen to their words, study how their money comes from, and then expose and struggle against the extravagant behavior of those black-hearted leaders.

    In addition, I suggest that all purchasing personnel rise up to bravely supervise the implementation of the financial budget, so that all units can save the wealth that can be saved, concentrate it, and effectively use it for socialist construction.　Yang Shuxun

### 一个采购员的话

    一个采购员的话
    我是个采购员，在这第四季度，我要向党和人民说几句话。平日我对采购工作并不感到困难，可是每到第四季度，我就感到有些难以招架。原因是：一到年底，在领导人的指示下，就要大量买东西，花的钱真是太多了。记得1952年底我们的领导人就召开过一个“花钱会”，对我们工作的评价就是看我们会不会花钱，花钱多就算完成任务，钱要是花不出去那当然就是工作不积极了。为什么要这样大量花钱呢？据说有这样几种理由：
    一、当年的预算要是花不完，缴上去，明年再做预算，据说就困难了。明明应该做那么多也不会批准那么多，工作就困难了……
    二、剩下的钱是大家节约下来的，很不容易呀！如果上缴了，不是白白辛苦一年了吗？现在我们有钱应该享用一番。
    三、国外订货款，有部分明年才能交货，货款也要明年付，这钱现在用掉，明年付款，可以再做明年的预算。
    我不明白这是些什么原则，他们为什么要用这样的心肠来对付国家财政机关呢？难道他们花的钱不是人民的血汗吗？我希望党和政府的领导同志在这个时候多多跑一跑商场、交通电工器材公司、五金公司、沙发店、无线电行同那些跑得满头大汗的采购员们谈谈心，听听他们的话，研究研究他们的钱是怎样来的，然后对那些黑心肠的领导人的挥霍行为，加以揭发和斗争。
    此外，我建议所有采购人员起来勇敢地监督财务预算的执行，让各个单位把可以节省的财富节省下来，集中起来，有效地用到社会主义建设上去。　杨树勋
