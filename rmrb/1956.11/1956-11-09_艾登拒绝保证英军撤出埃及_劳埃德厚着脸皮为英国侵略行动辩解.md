Xinhua News Agency, November 8th, London Dispatch: British Prime Minister Eden refused on November 7th in the House of Commons to guarantee that British troops would withdraw from Egypt if the United Nations decided not to include British and French forces in the "international police force." Eden also said: "There is absolutely no question in our minds of us, or our allies, withdrawing until the United Nations force is ready to take over."

Eden said: "Our troops have no intention of advancing beyond their present positions." At the same time, he added: "There will certainly be some movement of service troops, and perhaps to some extent of security troops, but this will not be an advance, but rather a move into Port Said."

When a Labour MP asked about the government's attitude towards the composition of the UN "international police force," Eden said: "This is a very serious matter; so far, our attitude on this whole question has been: can an effective force be established?" He also said that the government "is currently engaged in close and detailed discussions with the United States, France, and the Commonwealth countries." He believed that no opinion could be expressed before these discussions were concluded.

Xinhua News Agency, November 8th, London Dispatch: British Foreign Secretary Lloyd, in a radio address on the evening of November 7th, tried his best to defend the Anglo-French invasion of Egypt and seizure of the canal. He also issued a threat: "Britain, in cooperation with France, has shown the world that, if necessary, we still have the courage and ability to take action. It would be wrong to underestimate this."

Lloyd stated the "reasons" for British interference in Middle Eastern affairs, saying that Britain was "particularly concerned" about the situation in the Middle East, "not only because of historical reasons caused by mandates. The Middle East is a transportation hub between Europe, Asia, and Africa; it contains abundant oil resources; and there is the Suez Canal."

Lloyd then described the Anglo-French dispatch of troops to seize the Suez Canal as setting up a protective shield between the warring parties of Israel and Egypt to stop the war.

Lloyd welcomed the United Nations General Assembly's resolution on the establishment of an "International Emergency Force." At the same time, he described the 19th-century British imperialist "gunboat policy" and the current aggression against Egypt as maintaining peace and supporting the United Nations.

    艾登拒绝保证英军撤出埃及
    劳埃德厚着脸皮为英国侵略行动辩解
    新华社8日讯　伦敦消息：英国首相艾登11月7日在下院拒绝保证把军队撤出埃及，如果联合国决定不把英法部队包括在“国际警察部队”内的话。艾登还说：“在联合国部队来接管以前，我们心上根本就不存在什么我们或我们的盟国撤退的问题。”
    艾登说：“我们的军队无意从现有的阵地继续向前推进。”同时，他又说：“在勤务部队方面，在某种程度上或许还有公安部队，肯定是要有一定调动的，不过不是向前推进而是开进塞得港。”
    工党议员问到政府对联合国“国际警察部队”组成的态度的时候，艾登说：“这是一个非常严重的问题；到目前为止，我们在这整个问题上的态度就是：是不是能够建立一支有效的部队。”他还说，政府“目前正在同美国、法国和英联邦各国进行密切的和详细的讨论。”他认为，在这些讨论结束以前不能发表任何意见。
    据新华社8日讯　伦敦消息：英国外交大臣劳埃德11月7日晚上在广播演说中竭力为英法进攻埃及、夺取运河的行动辩护。他还发出威胁说：“英国在法国合作之下，已经向全世界表明，如果有必要，我们还是有勇气和能力来采取行动的。低估这一点将是错误的。”
    劳埃德申述英国干涉中东事务的“理由”说，英国对中东的局势“特别感到关切”，这“不仅由于委任统治而造成的历史上的原因。中东是欧洲、亚洲和非洲之间的交通孔道；它蕴藏着大量的石油资源；那里有着苏伊士运河。”
    劳埃德接着把英法两国出兵攫夺苏伊士运河说成是在以色列和埃及交战双方之间设置一道保护盾牌以阻止战争。
    劳埃德对联合国大会的关于成立“国际紧急部队”的决议表示欢迎。同时，他把十九世纪的英帝国主义“炮舰政策”和目前对埃及的侵略说成是维护和平和对联合国的支持。
