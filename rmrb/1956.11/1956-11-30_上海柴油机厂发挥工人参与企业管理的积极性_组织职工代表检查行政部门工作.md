Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai Electric Report, Xinhua News Agency reporter He Changhua, Xu Zhongni reported: The state-owned Shanghai Diesel Engine Factory has created a new experience in bringing into play the role of the Staff and Workers' Representative Assembly. Before convening the fourth-quarter Staff and Workers' Representative Assembly this October, they organized staff and worker representatives to conscientiously inspect the work of the administrative departments, thus making the Representative Assembly lively and full of vigor. In October, the factory's completion of the state plan was better than any month this year, and the situation in November is even more advanced.
    The reporters visited the factory's trade union chairman and staff and worker representatives, who all said that the staff and worker representatives had exercised their democratic rights to manage the enterprise. In the past, the factory's Staff and Workers' Representative Assembly, like many other factories, was merely a mobilization meeting to ensure the completion of production tasks. The representatives simply listened to the factory director's report at the meeting and then went back to convey and implement it. This time, the method of convening the meeting was changed, and nearly twenty days were spent preparing. On the one hand, the factory management sent the production tasks and measures plan for the fourth quarter to each workshop for full discussion at the preparatory meeting. On the other hand, the trade union learned from the experience of the National People's Congress in organizing representatives to conduct inspections, and organized five inspection groups with forty staff and worker representatives participating, going deep into various departments and workshops to inspect the work.
    The inspection groups mainly inspected the completion of the factory's seven planned targets, the implementation of technical organizational measures, the handling and promotion of rationalization proposals and advanced experiences, the status of safety and welfare work, and the handling of the opinions raised by the representatives at the last Staff and Workers' Representative Assembly, based on the collective contract for the second half of the year.
    The factory's Party Committee and administrative leaders fully supported the staff and worker representatives' inspection of administrative work, and conscientiously reported the situation to them and answered questions. There were individual department leaders who were not humble in accepting inspections or shirked responsibility and were criticized by the staff and worker representatives and superiors.
    The group inspecting the seven planned targets focused on inspecting the two main weak links in completing the annual plan this year – the very poor completion of the commercial indicators by the oil pump workshop and the turnover period of working capital exceeding the target. They made a detailed report on the inspection results at the Representative Assembly and put forward nine suggestions for improvement.
    The rationalization proposals and advanced experience inspection group made a report at the Representative Assembly after the inspection, in which they warned: Due to the serious procrastination of the personnel handling rationalization proposals, the number of rationalization proposals is currently decreasing, and in the third quarter, there were no proposals for inventions and technical improvements. The staff and worker representatives also requested the leaders to pay attention to mobilizing technical personnel to put forward more rationalization proposals, because the number of people proposing rationalization proposals was very small.
    The safety and welfare inspection group was relatively satisfied with the implementation of safety technical measures, and focused on criticizing the work that could be done but was not being done in terms of welfare.
    The problems revealed and the criticisms and suggestions put forward by the staff and worker representatives after in-depth inspection aroused the attention of the relevant departments in the factory. The deputy factory director in charge of leading the living and welfare departments convened a meeting after the inspection, formulated a plan to improve the work, and put forward a guarantee to improve the work at the Staff and Workers' Representative Assembly. Other administrative leaders also put forward guarantees to improve the work.
    This Staff and Workers' Representative Assembly has played a great role in ensuring the completion of the fourth-quarter plan because it brought into play the workers' enthusiasm for participating in enterprise management and exposed and criticized the shortcomings in the work from the bottom up. After the meeting, various workshops and departments have taken action. Many work section chiefs even invited workers from their work sections to discuss how to complete the plan on Sundays. The oil pump workshop, which did not complete the main indicators in the third quarter, overfulfilled the production plan in October.
    Now, the democratic atmosphere in the factory is active, and the staff and worker representatives' inspection work will become a regular system. In the near future, seven inspection groups are about to start inspection work again, and the number of staff and worker representatives participating in the inspection groups has increased to fifty-three. In addition to the five groups continuing to inspect the improvement of the five aspects, the newly established two inspection groups will inspect the two very important current issues – waste and the unhealthy tendencies in the ideological style of staff and workers.

    上海柴油机厂发挥工人参与企业管理的积极性
    组织职工代表检查行政部门工作
    据新华社上海电　新华社记者贺昌华、徐中尼报道：国营上海柴油机厂在发挥职工代表大会的作用方面创造了一项新的经验。他们在10月份召开今年第四季度的职工代表大会以前，组织职工代表认真地检查了行政各部门的工作，因此，使得代表大会开得活跃而富有生气。10月份，这个工厂完成国家计划的情况比今年任何一个月都好，11月份的情况更加有进步。
    记者访问了这个工厂的工会主席和职工代表，他们都说这次职工代表发挥了管理企业的民主权利。过去，这个工厂的职工代表大会也像别的许多工厂一样，仅仅是保证完成生产任务的动员大会，代表们只是在会上听了厂长的报告以后回去传达贯彻。这次改变了召开会议的方法，用了将近二十天的时间进行准备。一方面厂部把第四季度的生产任务和措施计划发交各个车间，在预备会议上充分讨论；另一方面工会吸取全国人民代表大会组织代表视察的经验，组织了有四十个职工代表参加的五个检查组，深入到各个科室各个车间去检查工作。
    检查组主要是根据下半年度的集体合同，检查全厂七项计划指标的完成情况、技术组织措施的执行情况、合理化建议及先进经验的处理和推广情况、安全福利工作的情况、以及上次职工代表大会上代表们所提意见的处理情况。
    厂里的中共党委和行政领导方面充分支持职工代表检查行政工作，都认真地向他们汇报情况，答复问题。曾经有个别部门的领导人不虚心接受检查或推诿责任，受到了职工代表和上级的批评。
    检查七项计划指标的小组，着重检查了今年完成年度计划的两个主要薄弱环节——油泵车间商品指标完成很差和流动资金周转期超过指标。他们把检查结果在代表大会上作了详细的报告，并且提出了九条改进的意见。
    合理化建议和先进经验检查组，检查后在代表大会上作报告，报告中提出警告：由于处理合理化建议的人员存在严重的拖拉作风，目前合理化建议正在减少，第三季度中没有一件是创造发明和技术改进的建议。职工代表还要求领导方面注意发动技术人员多提合理化建议，因为他们提合理化建议的人数很少。
    安全福利检查组对安全技术措施的执行情况比较满意，在福利方面着重批评了目前能够做得到而没有做的工作。
    职工代表经过深入检查以后揭露的问题和提出的批评建议，引起了厂里有关方面的重视。负责领导生活福利部门的副厂长，在检查以后就召开会议，订出了改进工作的计划，并且在职工代表大会上提出了改进工作的保证。其他行政领导人员，也提出了改进工作的保证。
    这次职工代表大会由于发挥了工人参与企业管理的积极性，对工作中的缺点自下而上地进行了揭露和批评，对保证完成第四季度计划将起很大作用。会议以后，各车间和科室已经行动起来，许多工段长星期天还约了本工段工人一起商量如何完成计划。第三季度主要指标都没有完成的油泵车间，10月份产量计划就超额完成了。
    现在全厂民主空气显得活跃，职工代表检查工作将成为经常性的制度。在最近期间，有七个检查组又要开始进行检查工作，参加检查组的职工代表增加到了五十三人。除了五个组继续检查五个方面的改进情况以外，新成立的两个检查组将检查当前很重要的两个问题——浪费情况和职工思想作风中的不良倾向。
