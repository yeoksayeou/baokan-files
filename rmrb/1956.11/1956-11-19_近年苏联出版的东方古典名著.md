The Institute of Oriental Studies of the Soviet Academy of Sciences has, in the two years of 1954 and 1955, collated, translated, and published many ancient and medieval historical and literary classics from the Orient. Some of these are rare manuscripts that have never been published before.

Among the published books, the more important ones include the original text and Russian translation of "Records of Military Exploits" Volumes 1 and 2, written by the 15th-century Syrian Nizam al-Din. This book is a biography of Timur, the founder of the Timurid Empire who ruled Central Asia at the end of the 14th century. It was compiled by the author on Timur's orders. The original text is in Persian and has never been published before. This is the first time it has been published and translated into a foreign language.

In addition, there are sixteen volumes of "Comprehensive Mirror for Aid in Government" translated by the 19th-century sinologist Bichurin, "The Great Yellow Book," a 14th-century Mongolian history book translated by Shastina, "Kutadgu Bilig" an 11th-century Uyghur history book translated by Valitova, "History of Prophets and Kings" a classic Arabic work from the 10th century translated by Belyaev, and the Armenian manuscript "Jambr" translated by Archunyan. "Arthashastra", a classic Indian work translated from Sanskrit by Shcherbatsky, "Man'yōshū", an ancient Japanese poetry collection translated by Gruschna, "Anthology of Oriental Classical Literature" Volume 3, a selection of works by ancient Chinese poets translated by Alekseyev. And "Seventy Stories of the Parrot," a famous ancient Indian literary work, and others.

In 1954, the Department of Ancient Oriental Documents of the Institute of Oriental Studies filmed ancient Tajik, Persian, Korean, Mongolian, and Georgian documents in the institute's collection, preparing them for publication. A "Catalogue of Ancient Tajik and Persian Documents" was also created.

In addition, in 1954, the Institute of Oriental Studies of the Uzbek Academy of Sciences published the Russian translation of the great work "The Canon of Medicine" by the Arab physician and philosopher Avicenna (Ibn Sina, 980-1037). This is the world's first translation of this work into a modern foreign language. (Ran)
