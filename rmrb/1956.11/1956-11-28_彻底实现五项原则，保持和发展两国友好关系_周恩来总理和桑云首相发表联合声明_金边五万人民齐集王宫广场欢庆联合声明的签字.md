　　Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, November 27th: Joint statement by Premier Zhou Enlai of the State Council of the People's Republic of China and Prime Minister Sihanouk of the Kingdom of Cambodia.

　　Premier Zhou Enlai of the State Council of the People's Republic of China visited the Kingdom of Cambodia in November 1956 at the invitation of His Royal Highness Prince Norodom Sihanouk in the name of the King and Queen of Cambodia, and at the invitation of the Royal Government and the Cambodian people, in return for the friendly visit of His Royal Highness Prince Norodom Sihanouk to the People's Republic of China in February 1956.

　　The King and Queen of Cambodia received Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier He Long and other accompanying personnel.

　　The Cambodian people warmly received Premier Zhou Enlai and his entourage, expressing the Cambodian people's full agreement with the policy of co-existence pursued between the People's Republic of China and the Kingdom of Cambodia, which strictly adheres to the Five Principles—Panchasila:

　　Respect for the territorial integrity and sovereignty of each country,

　　Mutual non-aggression,

　　Mutual non-interference in internal affairs,

　　Equality and mutual benefit,

　　Peaceful coexistence.

　　After the visit of His Royal Highness Prince Norodom Sihanouk, which introduced Cambodia to the Chinese people, Premier Zhou Enlai's visit further enhanced mutual understanding and mutual understanding between the peoples of China and Cambodia.

　　Premier Zhou Enlai held talks with His Royal Highness Prince Norodom Sihanouk, Cambodian Prime Minister Sangkum, and other members of the Royal Government.

　　During the talks, the two sides exchanged views in a friendly manner on issues related to the People's Republic of China and the Kingdom of Cambodia, and on international issues of common concern to the two countries. The two sides reaffirmed once again that the policy adopted by the two governments in accordance with the Five Principles is not only conducive to the prosperity of the two peoples, but also conducive to maintaining peace in Asia and the world.

　　The two sides firmly believe that the failure to implement the Five Principles or the lack of faith in the Five Principles is the cause of unrest and conflict, the consequences of which not only seriously endanger the economic life of the whole world, but also endanger the confidence of the peoples of all countries, because the expressions of peace and freedom by those who are unwilling to implement or believe in these principles cannot be sincere.

　　When exchanging views on the international situation, the two sides believe that the current international disputes can and should be resolved peacefully on the basis of adhering to the Five Principles.

　　The two sides expressed satisfaction with the fact that the Chinese expatriates in Cambodia have always coexisted with the Cambodian people in a friendly and correct manner. Premier Zhou Enlai stated that the Chinese expatriates in Cambodia should strictly abide by the laws and decrees of the Cambodian Kingdom, respect the customs of the Cambodian people, not participate in local political activities, and should materially participate in Cambodia's efforts for national prosperity and the welfare of the people. Prime Minister Sangkum accepted these expressions of Premier Zhou Enlai with satisfaction.

　　The two sides believe that since the visit of His Royal Highness Prince Norodom Sihanouk to China, the friendly relations between the People's Republic of China and the Kingdom of Cambodia have made great progress. The two sides agree that maintaining and developing relations between the two countries, especially economic relations, will be achieved through trade and unconditional economic assistance from China, which the Cambodian people greatly value.

　　In the friendly relations between the two countries, the two sides are determined to thoroughly implement the letter and spirit of the Five Principles, so that such relations become a model of international cooperation and understanding between peoples, and contribute to peace in Asia and the world.

    新华社金边27日电　中华人民共和国国务院总理周恩来和柬埔寨王国政府首相桑云的联合声明。
    中华人民共和国国务院总理周恩来，应诺罗敦·西哈努克亲王殿下以柬埔寨国王和王后陛下的名义的邀请，并应王国政府和柬埔寨人民的邀请，在1956年11月访问了柬埔寨王国，以回报诺罗敦·西哈努克亲王殿下在1956年2月在中华人民共和国进行的友好访问。
    柬埔寨国王和王后陛下接见了周恩来总理、贺龙副总理和其他的随行人员。
    柬埔寨人民隆重地接待了周恩来总理和他的随行人员，借以表示柬埔寨人民完全赞同中华人民共和国和柬埔寨王国所执行的共处政策，这一政策严格遵守五项原则——潘查希拉：
    尊重每一个国家的领土完整和主权，
    互不侵犯，
    互不干涉内政，
    平等互利，
    和平共处。
    在诺罗敦·西哈努克亲王殿下进行了对中国人民介绍柬埔寨的访问之后，周恩来总理的访问又使中柬两国人民进一步地互相认识和互相了解。
    周恩来总理同诺罗敦·西哈努克亲王殿下、柬埔寨桑云首相和王国政府的其他成员进行了会谈。
    在会谈中，双方就有关中华人民共和国和柬埔寨王国的问题和两国共同关心的国际问题友好地交换了意见。双方再一次确认，两国政府依照五项原则而采取的政策，不仅有利于两国人民的繁荣，而且有利于维护亚洲和世界的和平。
    双方坚信，不实行五项原则或者不相信五项原则是不安和冲突的原因，其后果不仅严重地危及全世界的经济生活，而且危及各国人民的信心，因为不愿实行或者不愿相信这些原则的人们关于和平和自由的表示不可能是真诚的。
    双方就国际局势交换意见时，认为目前的国际争论能够而且应该在遵守五项原则的基础上，通过和平方式求得解决。
    双方对中国在柬埔寨的侨民同柬埔寨人民一向友好地和正确地相处的事实表示满意。周恩来总理表示，在柬埔寨的中国侨民应该严格遵守柬埔寨王国的法律和法令，尊重柬埔寨人民的习惯，不参加当地政治活动，并且应该在物质上参加柬埔寨为国家繁荣和人民福利而进行的努力。桑云首相满意地接受周恩来总理的这些表示。
    双方认为，自诺罗敦·西哈努克亲王殿下访华以来，中华人民共和国和柬埔寨王国之间的友好关系已经有了巨大的进展。双方同意，保持和发展两国之间的关系，特别是经济关系，这将通过贸易和柬埔寨人民十分重视的中国无条件的经济援助来予以实现。
    在两国的友好关系中，双方决心彻底实现五项原则的文字和精神，以便使这样的关系成为国际合作和各国人民之间谅解的榜样，并且对亚洲和世界和平作出贡献。
