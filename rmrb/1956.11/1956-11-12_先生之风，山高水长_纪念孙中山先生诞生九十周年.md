    Mr. Sun Yat-sen's Demeanor: As High as the Mountains, As Long as the River
    Commemorating the Ninetieth Anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's Birth
    Chen Mingshu
    The clouds shroud the mountains, the river flows wide;
    Mr. Sun's demeanor, as high as the mountains, as long as the river.
    --Fan Zhongyan "Record of the Ancestral Hall of Mr. Yan"
    On the occasion of commemorating the ninetieth anniversary of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's birth, I recall the respectful title that all of Mr. Sun's old comrades used to call him - "Mr." This title carries the meanings of leader, mentor, comrade, and a relationship as close as family. From this, I am reminded of the above eloquent sentences, and I believe that only a person like Mr. Sun Yat-sen deserves such a title.
    Mr. Sun was an outstanding thinker and great revolutionist in history, and also the great leader of China's early democratic revolution movement. After overthrowing the Qing Dynasty feudal regime, he continued to adhere to the struggle against imperialism and feudalism. His late-year Three Great Policies of alliance with Russia, alliance with the Communist Party, and assistance to peasants and workers even more powerfully demonstrated his foresight and relentless fighting spirit. He devoted his life to the revolution, and his outstanding contributions to the era have already been given extremely fair evaluations by revolutionary leaders and politicians at home and abroad. As a believer of Mr. Sun, I only want to talk about Mr. Sun's ideological influence on me personally, as well as his anti-colonialist struggle and the idea of "Asia is one family."
    First of all, in describing Mr. Sun's ideological influence on me, I inevitably have to involve some historical fragments and my personal experience, but it can also serve as a side reflection of Mr. Sun's entire activities.
    I joined the Tongmenghui (Revolutionary Alliance) when I was only sixteen years old, which has been more than half a century ago. At that time, I had just entered the Huangpu Military Academy and learned about Mr. Sun Yat-sen and the general outline of his revolutionary ideas when I secretly read the "Min Bao" published in Tokyo. This was the beginning of my devotion to the revolutionary cause. When the Xinhai Revolution broke out, I was studying at the Nanjing Military Academy. After hearing the news, I led dozens of Tongmenghui comrades from the school to Wuhan to join the army and was assigned to Huang Xing's student team. After the failure, I returned to Shanghai and joined the Northern Expedition Army of Yao Yuping, Commander-in-Chief of the Guangdong Army. After the victory, I returned to Nanjing, where Mr. Sun assumed the post of Provisional President. I followed Yao Yuping to the Presidential Palace to pay my respects and congratulations. Mr. Sun shook hands and talked with us kindly. Mr. Sun's life was simple and approachable, and he was full of comradely concern for us. This was the beginning of my meeting with Mr. Sun. Mr. Sun's voice, smile, and my thoughts and feelings at that time are still vividly engraved in my mind.
    In 1920, Chen Jiongming's Guangdong Army returned to Guangdong from Fujian and drove away Mo Rongxin's Guangxi Army. At that time, I led the local troops and was stationed in Xijiang. Because of Mr. Sun's call, I took the lead in launching an uprising. Later, I was ordered to concentrate in Zhaoqing to intercept the Guangxi Army's return route. After the matter was settled, I was ordered to be stationed in Liangyang as the commander of the Forty-Fourth Regiment. At that time, in view of the corruption and deterioration of the old-style army and the prevalence of corruption among military officers, I deeply unwilling to associate with them. I learned that among the military personnel led by Mr. Sun, Deng Keng (Zhongyuan) was the most revolutionary. Deng was then Chen Jiongming's Chief of Staff and would compile the First Division of the Guangdong Army and serve as the division commander. In addition to the original patrol battalion that could be compiled into three regiments, there was still a shortage of one regiment. I then asked my classmate Deng Yanda (then Deng Keng's staff officer) to request that my four battalions be reduced to three battalions, forming one regiment, and joining the First Division. Before the matter was settled, I, through the introduction of my classmate Lu Chao, met Mr. Sun and requested his approval of my request. This time, my impression of Mr. Sun was even more profound. His heroic and vigorous, great and majestic atmosphere still makes me want to see the image of this giant of the era.
    When I was the commander of the Fourth Regiment of the First Division of the Guangdong Army, all the officers and soldiers of the regiment were influenced by Mr. Sun's revolutionary doctrine, and everyone was brave in public warfare. When Lu Rongting of Guangxi continued to undermine the revolution, the Guangdong and Guangxi armies fought fiercely in Wuzhou and were deadlocked. The Guangxi army also invaded from the north. Division Commander Deng Keng commanded calmly and ordered me to lead the Fourth Regiment and Deng Yanda's Independent Battalion to take the Lianjiangkou route, completely annihilating Shen Hongying's Guangxi army in Han Guang. After the situation in Guangxi was settled, the army moved north. Mr. Sun took office as Grand Marshal. The First Division was ordered to go north and advance towards Jiangxi, fighting a major battle with the warlord Chen Guangyuan's troops in Ganzhou, fighting hard for seven days and nights, and finally conquering Ganzhou. Just hoping that the momentum would become unstoppable and the revolution could proceed smoothly. Unfortunately, at this time, Mr. Sun's close comrade-in-arms, Division Commander Deng Keng, was suddenly assassinated and sniped at the Guangzhou Dashatou Guangjiu Railway Station. Mr. Sun was like losing a limb and was extremely saddened, and the whole army was shocked. Afterwards, there was Chen Jiongming's rebellion, Mr. Sun left Guangdong, and I also resigned and went south.
    In 1923, Mr. Sun returned to Guangdong and established a revolutionary government. I returned to Guangdong and served as the Chief of Staff of the First Division and the Brigade Commander of the First Brigade. When the Kuomintang was reorganized, Mr. Sun stood against all odds, demonstrated an indomitable spirit, carried out a resolute struggle with the right wing, and implemented the policy of alliance with the Soviet Union, opposition to imperialism, and cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. As a result, the entire revolutionary situation was completely renewed. Mr. Sun worked hard and was extremely tired. Fortunately, Mr. Liao Zhongkai always remained loyal to Mr. Sun's proposition and strongly supported Mr. Sun's Three Great Policies. Mr. Sun continued to work hard and resolutely went north in the winter of 1924, calling on the whole country to "convene a national conference." During Mr. Sun's trip north, our army had a major defeat against Lin Hu in Xingning, East River. When the war ended, I received a telegram from Commander-in-Chief Xu Chongzhi, summoning me back to Shantou. On the same day, I suddenly received the news of Mr. Sun's death in Beijing. Like a bolt from the blue, I suffered extremely heavy grief.
    I was deeply influenced by Mr. Sun's thoughts, and I deeply regret that I did not receive more teachings from Mr. Sun, but Mr. Sun's loyal believers and close comrades-in-arms - Division Commander Deng Keng and Mr. Liao Zhongkai - were my closest beneficial friends and good teachers. Unfortunately, both of them were assassinated by treacherous people one after another and could not make more contributions to the revolutionary cause, which I will always regret.
    Secondly, I want to talk about the heroic spirit shown by Mr. Sun's anti-colonialist struggle, as well as his idea of "Asia is one family," and the contemporary significance of this idea.
    The famous Shameen Incident is a glorious page in China's anti-colonial struggle. When Mr. Sun Yat-sen was suppressing Chen Jiongming's rebellion, he personally led five warships including the Yongfeng to advance from Huangpu to Guangzhou. The British Consul-General in Shameen made a tough and unreasonable request, demanding that Mr. Sun withdraw from the Pearl River. Mr. Sun was unmoved and sternly refuted him, saying, "The Pearl River is a river in Chinese territory, and I have complete freedom of action." As a result, Mr. Sun persisted in Bai'etan for more than two months, greatly attacking the arrogance of imperialism. Mr. Sun's heroic behavior was of great enlightenment to the Chinese people and of great educational significance to me. During the Second Eastern Expedition, I was responsible for recovering the Southern Route. When I was stationed in Beihai, I refused the French Consul's hypocritical "welcome"; and ordered the local Audit Office (a tax collection agency controlled by foreigners) to report the tax revenue to me on a monthly basis, and intercepted the tax revenue to be used as military expenses; at the same time, I expelled the British Vice-Consul who sheltered opium trafficking and human trafficking. This was the first time I emulated Mr. Sun in striking at imperialism. When Japanese imperialism was pressing hard on our country, I and all the officers and soldiers of the 19th Route Army fired the first shot of resistance against Japanese aggression in Shanghai. Based on their own personal experience, the Chinese people came to the conclusion that imperialism can be overthrown, and it will definitely be overthrown.
    Mr. Sun's idea of "Asia is one family" is based on national liberation and people's liberation, which is also the manifestation of the "freedom and equality" advocated by Mr. Sun in international affairs.
    In the nearly thirty years after Mr. Sun's death, world history has entered a new era--socialism has gone beyond the scope of one country and formed a great world system; a series of nationally independent countries in Asia and Africa have broken the shackles of colonialism; at present, the magnificent national liberation movement in the world has formed a huge world torrent. This is the current world situation. In the past few years, our country has experienced two great historical changes. After the victory of the democratic revolution, the people of the whole country have also achieved a decisive victory in the socialist transformation. Under the great banner of patriotism and socialism, the people of the whole country are advancing with one heart and one mind, striving to build our country from a backward agricultural country into an advanced industrial country in a short period of time. Mr. Sun's ideal has been fully realized, and it has greatly exceeded it due to the leapfrog development of the times.
    Of course, we have not forgotten that our territory, Taiwan, is still occupied by U.S. imperialism, and other countries in Asia are still controlled and harmed by colonialists to varying degrees. There are also hydrogen weapon tests in the Pacific, threatening the lives of good people. The people of Asia, who have a long history of traditional friendship, are still deeply influenced by the idea of "Asia is one family" of Sun Yat-sen, an outstanding thinker of the East. This is not accidental, because they have a common destiny and a common ideal. The "Panchsheel" initiated by the Prime Ministers of our country, India, and Burma and the "Bandung Spirit" of uniting Asian and African countries are playing an increasingly wider role. Mr. Sun's idea of "Asia is one family" has been newly developed.
    Mr. Sun was a great patriot, and this spirit ran through all his activities in his life. Here I think of the people in Taiwan: when the motherland is summoning you with "patriotism as one family", when the people of the whole country are commemorating the ninetieth anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's birth with incomparable respect, looking back on the past and looking at the present, I can't help but hope that you can face the reality and make a choice for your own future.
    Finally, I repeat the song:
    The clouds shroud the mountains, the river flows wide;
    Mr. Sun's demeanor, as high as the mountains, as long as the river.

    先生之风，山高水长
    纪念孙中山先生诞生九十周年
    陈铭枢
    云山苍苍，江水泱泱；
    先生之风，山高水长。
    ——范仲淹“严先生祠堂记”
    在纪念中山先生诞生九十周年之际，我回忆起中山先生生前所有老同志们对他的尊敬的称号——先生。这一称号具有着领袖、导师、同志和亲如家人的关系的含义。由此，我联想到以上几句情文并茂的辞句，认为只有像中山先生这样的人物，才能当之无愧。
    先生是历史上杰出的大思想家、大革命家，同时又是我国早期民主革命运动的伟大领袖。他在推翻清朝封建王朝之后，仍继续坚持反帝反封建的斗争。他晚年的联俄、联共、扶助农工三大政策更有力地显示了他的高瞻远瞩和战斗不息的精神。他毕生尽瘁革命，对于时代所作的卓越贡献已有中外的革命领袖和政治家们，替他作了极其公允的评价。作为先生的信徒的我，只想就先生对于我个人的思想影响，以及他的反殖民主义斗争和“亚洲是一家”的思想来谈谈。
    首先，在叙述先生对我的思想影响时，免不了要涉及一些历史片断和我个人的经历，但对于先生的全部活动，也可以作为一个侧面的反映。
    我参加同盟会时，年仅十六岁，迄经已有半个世纪以上了。当时我刚入黄埔陆军小学不久，在偷读东京出版的“民报”时，始知有先生其人，及其革命主张的大略。此为我服膺革命事业的发轫。辛亥革命军兴，我在南京陆军中学肄业，闻讯后率同学中同盟会的同志数十人，赴武汉投军，被编入黄兴的学生队。失败后回上海，参加粤军总司令姚雨平的北伐军。胜利后回南京，适先生就任临时大总统。我随姚雨平入总统府进谒致贺。先生与我们亲切握手谈话。先生生活朴素，平易近人，对我们充满了同志的关怀。此为我与先生晤面之始。先生当时的声音笑貌，以及我在当时的思想感受，至今犹历历镌在脑际。
    1920年，粤军陈炯明由闽回粤，驱走桂军莫荣新。其时我率地方部队，驻防西江，因受先生的号召，首先起义，旋奉命集中肇庆，截击桂军归路。事定后奉命驻防两阳，任第四十四统领。时鉴于旧式军队腐化恶劣，军官贪污成风，我深不愿与之同流合污。得知先生领导下的军人中，首推邓铿（仲元）最富革命朝气。邓当时为陈炯明参谋长，将编粤军第一师，并任师长，除原有巡防营可编三团外，尚缺一团兵员。我乃请同学邓演达（时为邓铿参谋）转请将我的四营人，缩编三营，成一团，加入第一师。事定前，我因同学吕超的引见，谒见先生请求批准我的要求。此次我对先生印象更为深刻，他的英姿爽发，伟大磅礴的气象，至今犹使我时刻想见这一时代巨人的形象。
    我在粤军第一师任第四团团长时，全团官兵均受先生革命主义的熏陶，人人勇于公战。当广西陆荣廷继续破坏革命时，粤桂两军激战于梧州，相持不下，桂军且从北路侵入。邓铿师长指挥若定，令我率第四团及邓演达的独立营任连江口一路，完全消灭桂军沈鸿英部于涵洸。桂局定后，移师北伐，先生就任大元帅职。第一师奉令北伐，向江西推进，与军阀陈光远部大战于赣州，苦战七昼夜，卒克赣州。方冀势成破竹，革命进行可望顺利。不幸正于此时，先生的亲密战友邓铿师长，突遭暗算，被狙击于广州大沙头广九车站。先生如失手足，悲痛逾恒，全军亦为之震动。其后乃有陈炯明的叛变，先生旋即离粤，我亦弃职南下。
    1923年先生回粤，成立革命政府，我始回粤任第一师参谋长兼第一旅旅长。国民党改组时，先生力排众议，表现了不挠不屈的精神，与右派进行坚决的斗争，实行联合苏联，反对帝国主义，国共合作的政策。由此整个革命局面焕然一新，先生惨淡经营，备极劳瘁。幸有廖仲恺先生始终忠实于先生的主张，并一力赞助先生的三大政策。先生再接再厉，于1924年冬毅然北上，以“召开国民会议”向全国号召。在先生北上期间，我军曾在东江大破林虎于兴宁。在战事结束时，我奉总司令许崇智电召回汕头的当日，突接先生在北京逝世的消息，晴天霹雳，使我受到极其沉重的悲痛。
    我受先生的思想影响是极其深刻的，而亲炙先生的教诲则深恨不多，但先生的忠实信徒和亲密战友——邓铿师长和廖仲恺先生，则是我最接近的益友而兼良师。可惜两人先后均遭奸人暗算，不能替革命事业作出更多的贡献，这是我永远引以为遗憾的。
    其次，要说到先生反殖民主义斗争所表现的英雄气概，以及他的 “亚洲是一家”的思想，和这一思想在今天的时代意义。
    有名的沙面事件，是我国反殖民斗争的光辉的一页。中山先生在戡定陈炯明叛乱时，亲率永丰等五艘军舰由黄埔进兵广州，驻在沙面的英国总领事，竟提出强硬的无理要求，要先生退出珠江。先生不为所动，并严正地驳斥说：“珠江是中国领土的河川，我完全有行动的自由”。结果先生在白鹅潭坚持了两个多月，大大地打击了帝国主义的气焰。先生这一英勇行为，对于中国人民的启示是大的，对于我也有极大的教育意义。当第二次东征时，我负责收复南路，在进驻北海时，我拒绝了法国领事对我的虚伪“欢迎”；并勒令当地稽核所（由外人控制的税收机关）按月向我呈报税收情况，并截留税款，留作军费；同时又将包庇贩卖烟土、贩卖人口的英国副领事驱逐出境。此为我效法先生，第一次打击帝国主义的情况。当日本帝国主义在我国咄咄进逼的时候，我和十九路军全体官兵，在淞沪放出了反抗日本侵略的第一枪。中国人民根据自己的切身经验，得出了这样的结论：帝国主义是可以打倒的，而且是一定可以打倒的。
    先生“亚洲是一家”的思想，是以民族解放和人民解放为基础的，也就是先生揭橥的“自由、平等”在国际事务中的表现。
    先生逝世后的近三十年，世界历史已进入了一个崭新的时代，——社会主义已经越出了一个国家范围，形成了一个伟大的世界体系；在亚洲和非洲挣断了殖民主义枷锁的还有一系列的民族独立国家；目前，世界范围内波澜壮阔的民族解放运动，已经形成了一股巨大的世界洪流。这是当前的世界情景。我们国家在这几年来，经历了两次伟大的历史变革，全国人民继民主革命胜利之后，又取得了社会主义改造的决定性胜利。全国人民万众一心地在伟大的爱国主义、社会主义的旗帜下，正在迈步前进，要在一个不长的时间内，把我国从落后的农业国建设为先进的工业国。先生的理想已全部实现了，而且由于时代的飞跃发展，还大大超过了。
    当然，我们并没有忘记，我国的领土台湾，仍然被美帝国主义侵占着，在亚洲其他国家还不同程度的受着殖民主义者的控制和伤害，太平洋上还有氢武器的试验，威胁着善良人民的生命安全。有悠久历史传统友谊的亚洲的人民，对于东方杰出的思想家——孙中山先生“亚洲是一家”的思想，至今仍发生着深刻的影响。这不是偶然的，因为他们有着共同的命运和共同的理想。我国总理和印、缅总理所首倡的“潘查希拉”和团结亚非国家的“万隆精神”已日益发生着更广泛的作用。先生的“亚洲是一家”的思想，已经得到了新的发展。
    先生是一个伟大的爱国主义者，在他的一生活动中，都贯串着这一精神。在这里我想到了在台湾的人们：当祖国正以“爱国一家”向你们召唤的时候，全国人民正以无比崇敬的心情来纪念中山先生诞生九十周年的时候，抚今追昔，我情不自禁地希望你们能够正视现实，并对自己的前途，有所抉择。
    最后，我重复歌唱：
    云山苍苍，江水泱泱；
    先生之风，山高水长。
