Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: More than 5,000 criminals undergoing labor reform in Qinghai Province have now been transformed into new people.

After serving their sentences and being released, some of these criminals have taken jobs locally. A construction company has trained more than 1,300 inmates in various skills. A clothing factory has transformed over 700 inmates into skilled tailors. Through labor reform, many criminals have abandoned their evil ways and have come to understand new moral values. For example, Lu Ruixiang, who now works at the Xinsheng Lime Factory, used to be an idler with bad habits and was physically weak. Now, he has become strong and energetic, actively participates in labor, and can motivate others to produce. Wang Jinshan, who used to be a thief, went to the bank to withdraw money after being released and employed. A bank clerk carelessly gave him ten yuan more than he was due. Upon noticing the error, he immediately returned the extra money to the bank.

    青海省五千多名罪犯在劳动改造中成为新人
    据新华社讯　在青海省劳动改造的犯罪分子，现在已有五千多人被改造成为新人。
    这些犯罪分子在刑满被释放后，有的就地参加了工作。有一个建筑公司先后曾使一千三百多名犯人学到了技术。有一个被服厂有七百多犯人成了有技术的裁缝。经过劳动改造，有不少犯人已经改邪归正，懂得了新的道德。如现在新生石灰厂工作的吕瑞祥，过去是一个不务正业并染有不良嗜好的人，身体瘦弱不堪。现在已变得身强力壮，积极劳动，并且能带动别人生产。过去当过小偷的王金三，被释放就业以后，有一次到银行取款，银行工作人员一时粗心多给了十元，他发现后马上将多给的款退回银行。
