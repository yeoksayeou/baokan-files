Friends, Comrades:
    I now announce the commencement of the Commemorative Meeting for the Ninetieth Anniversary of the Birth of Mr. Sun Yat-sen.
    Today is the ninetieth anniversary of the birth of Mr. Sun Yat-sen. We commemorate this outstanding pioneer of China's modern democratic revolution with reverence and remembrance. Mr. Sun Yat-sen was a heroic fighter who led the overthrow of the feudal imperial system and struggled for the establishment of a democratic republic, and a patriot who opposed imperialist aggression and fought for the independence and freedom of the motherland. In his later years, he further adopted the three major policies of alliance with the Soviet Union, alliance with the Communist Party, and assistance to the workers' and peasants’ movements, developing the old Three People's Principles into the new Three People's Principles. He was a great revolutionary and statesman.
    Today, as we commemorate the ninetieth anniversary of the birth of Mr. Sun Yat-sen, we see that China has undergone tremendous and fundamental changes. Mr. Sun Yat-sen's ideals and the cause of China's democratic revolution, which he initiated but did not complete, have been inherited and realized by the Chinese working class and its party—the Chinese Communist Party—thereby transforming China from a semi-feudal and semi-colonial country ruled by imperialism, bureaucrat-capitalism, and feudalism into an independent, free, and democratic country. After thoroughly completing the bourgeois democratic revolution, the Chinese people have subsequently achieved a decisive victory in the socialist revolution. Now, the Chinese people are engaged in large-scale socialist construction to transform our country from a backward agricultural country into a prosperous and happy industrial country.
    China's territory, Taiwan, is still subject to American aggression. All patriots, all loyal followers of Mr. Sun Yat-sen, should work together to achieve the peaceful liberation of Taiwan.
    Today, as we commemorate the ninetieth anniversary of the birth of Mr. Sun Yat-sen, we see that the countries in Asia, Africa, and other regions that were once occupied by imperialism have also undergone or are about to undergo tremendous and profound changes. Mr. Sun Yat-sen's ideas of democratic revolution not only had a tremendous impact on the previous revolutionary stage in China, but also had a significant impact on many countries in Asia that are implementing national independence and democratic revolution. In the Asian region, the Arab countries, and many respectable patriots and insightful politicians in Latin America who sympathize with Mr. Sun Yat-sen's ideas and cause are also committed to safeguarding their national independence, opposing the rule of colonialists, and expelling the aggressive forces of imperialists. The era in which colonialists and imperialists could do whatever they wanted is gone forever. The 600 million Chinese people, who have finally achieved revolutionary victory after a long and arduous struggle, extend a warm hand of support to the great Egyptian people who are heroically fighting on both sides of the Suez Canal, and extend a warm hand of support to all countries and peoples in Asia and Africa and throughout the world who are engaged in the heroic struggle against colonialism as we commemorate the 90th anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's birthday.
    Mr. Sun Yat-sen was a good friend of the Soviet Union. When he passed away in 1925, he left a letter to the Soviet Union embodying great friendship. The Chinese people cherish this historical document very much. In the seven years since the victory of the Chinese revolution, the militant friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people has deepened. Any conspiracy by imperialism to provoke discord between China and the Soviet Union is a futile fantasy.
    We thank the international friends who once assisted Mr. Sun Yat-sen in the Chinese revolution, and express our condolences to the families of the international friends who sacrificed their blood for the Chinese revolution.
    Mr. Sun Yat-sen's great contribution to the Chinese people is immortal in Chinese history. I suggest that everyone stand up and pay tribute to the great Mr. Sun Yat-sen.

### 中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会主席  周恩来的开会词

    中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会主席
    周恩来的开会词朋友们、同志们：
    现在我宣布孙中山先生诞生九十周年纪念大会开始。
    今天是孙中山先生诞生九十周年的纪念日。我们谨以崇敬和怀念的心情，纪念我国近代民主革命的这位卓越的先驱。孙中山先生是领导推翻封建帝制、为建立民主共和国而奋斗的英勇战士，是反对帝国主义侵略、为祖国的独立自由而斗争的爱国者。他在晚年，又进一步采取联合苏联、联合共产党、扶助工农运动的三大政策，把旧的三民主义发展为新的三民主义。他是伟大的革命家和政治家。
    今天，当我们纪念孙中山先生诞生九十周年的时候，我们看到中国已经发生了巨大的和根本的变化。孙中山先生的理想和由他揭开了序幕而未完成的中国民主主义革命事业，已由中国工人阶级和它的政党——中国共产党所继承和实现，从而把中国由帝国主义、官僚资本主义、封建主义统治的半封建半殖民地的国家变成为独立、自由、民主的国家。中国人民在彻底地完成了资产阶级民主主义革命以后，接着又取得了社会主义革命的决定性的胜利。现在中国人民正进行着大规模的社会主义建设，要把我国由落后的农业国变为富强幸福的工业国。
    中国的领土台湾还受着美国的侵略。一切爱国者，一切孙中山先生的忠实信徒，应当共同努力，实现台湾的和平解放。
    今天，当我们纪念孙中山先生诞生九十周年的时候，我们看到了亚洲、非洲和其它地区过去被帝国主义所侵占的国家，也发生了或者正要发生巨大而深刻的变化。孙中山先生的民主革命的思想，不仅在中国前一个革命阶段中发生了巨大的影响，而且对亚洲许多实行民族独立、民主革命的国家，也发生了不小的影响。亚洲地区、阿拉伯国家，以及拉丁美洲的许多同情孙中山先生的思想和事业的、可尊敬的爱国者和有见识的政治家们，也正在致力于维护本国的民族独立，反对殖民主义者的统治，驱逐帝国主义者的侵略势力。殖民主义者、帝国主义者们可以为所欲为的时代已经一去而不复返了。经过长期艰苦奋斗而终于取得革命胜利的六万万中国人民，在今天纪念孙中山先生诞生九十周年的时候，向着苏伊士运河两岸进行着英勇抗战的伟大的埃及人民伸出热烈支援的手，向着亚非两大洲和全世界所有反殖民主义的英勇斗争的国家和人民伸出热烈支援的手。
    孙中山先生是苏联的好朋友。他在1925年逝世的时候，留下了一封体现着伟大友谊的致苏联遗书。中国人民十分珍重这一封历史性的文献。中国革命胜利后的七年以来，中国人民和苏联人民的战斗的友谊更加深厚了。帝国主义企图挑拨中苏友谊的任何阴谋，都是徒劳的幻想。
    我们感谢为了中国革命曾经援助过孙中山先生的国际朋友们，并且向为中国革命牺牲流血的国际朋友们的遗族表示慰问。
    孙中山先生对中国人民的伟大贡献，在中国的历史上是永垂不朽的。我建议大家起来，向伟大的孙中山先生致敬。
