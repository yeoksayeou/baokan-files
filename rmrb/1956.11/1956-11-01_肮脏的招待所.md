    Dirty Guesthouse
    The Changchun Municipal People's Committee has a three-story guesthouse that looks quite beautiful on the outside. However, everyone who stays here is distressed. This guesthouse often crams six or even eight guests into a small room, leaving guests with almost no room to move around. The floors are often not cleaned, the spittoons sometimes overflow, the bedding is full of lice due to long periods without washing, and the water jugs in the guest rooms are always empty. The guesthouse's management personnel spend all day playing cards, chess, chatting, and gossiping, and guests often can't find them when they need something. However, this terrible guesthouse still charges guests 1.20 yuan per day for accommodation.
    It is hoped that the Changchun Municipal People's Committee, for the sake of the health of the cadres staying in the guesthouse, will quickly improve the management of the guesthouse.　Liu Zhilin

### 肮脏的招待所

    肮脏的招待所
    长春市人民委员会有一座三层楼房的招待所，楼房外表很漂亮。但是住在这里的人，没有一个人不苦恼。这个招待所往往把六个甚至八个客人安置到一间不大的寝室里，客人们几乎连活动的余地都没有，地板经常不擦，痰盂里的水有时溢了出来，被褥因长久不洗生了虱子，放在客人寝室里的水壶老是没水。招待所的管理人员整天凑在一起打扑克，下象棋，闲谈，乱扯，客人们有事往往找不到他们。但是，这样恶劣的招待所，竟然每天还要向客人收一元二角的住寝费。
    希望长春市人民委员会，为住招待所的干部的健康着想，迅速改进招待所的管理工作。　刘志林
