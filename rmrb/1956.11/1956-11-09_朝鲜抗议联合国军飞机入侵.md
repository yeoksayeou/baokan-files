    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 8th. The Korean Central News Agency was authorized on the 8th to issue a statement, denouncing the provocative act of military aircraft of the United Nations forces violating the Armistice Agreement by intruding into the airspace of the northern half of Korea.
    At approximately 8 a.m. on the 7th, two P-51 aircraft from the United Nations forces intruded into the airspace over Paechon, Chaeryong, Sibyon-ri, and Sinki of Hwanghae-namdo and Hwanghae-bukto in the northern half of Korea, and attacked aircraft of the Korean People's Army Air Force flying over the Sibyon-ri area. The People's Army Air Force acted in self-defense, immediately shooting down one United Nations forces aircraft, which crashed in the Sinki County area. The other United Nations forces aircraft fled south of the Military Demarcation Line.
    The statement pointed out that in order to create tension in Korea, Syngman Rhee openly declared on October 31 that military action would be taken against North Korea after the U.S. presidential election. This provocative incident is an attempt to further worsen the current international situation, and the entire responsibility for this incident lies entirely with the United Nations forces.
    The statement said that the Korean people resolutely demand that the United Nations forces take effective measures to prevent the recurrence of similar incidents.

    朝鲜抗议联合国军飞机入侵
    新华社平壤8日电　朝鲜中央通讯社8日受权发表声明，斥责联合国军的军用飞机违反停战协定侵入朝鲜北半部上空的挑衅行为。
    7日上午8时许，联合国军方面的P—51型飞机两架侵入朝鲜北半部黄海南道和黄海北道的白川、载宁、市边里和新溪的上空，并且在市边里地区上空向飞行着的朝鲜人民军空军的飞机进行攻击。人民军空军实行自卫，当场击落联合国军飞机一架，这架飞机坠落在新溪郡地区，另一架联合国军飞机逃回军事分界线以南。
    声明指出，为了制造朝鲜的紧张局势，李承晚在10月31日公开宣称，在美国总统选举以后就对北朝鲜采取军事行动。这次挑衅事件是企图使目前的国际局势更加恶化，这个事件的一切责任，完全在联合国军方面。
    声明说，朝鲜人民坚决要求联合国军方面必须采取有效措施，防止类似事件的再次发生。
