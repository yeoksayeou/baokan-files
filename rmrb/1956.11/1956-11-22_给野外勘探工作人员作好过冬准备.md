Xinhua News Agency, Karamay, 21st: The winter equipment problem for the more than 10,000 workers building the Karamay oil region has been properly resolved. To date, the Karamay Mining Bureau has built more than 43,000 square meters of housing and more than 10,000 square meters of cellars; more than 5,000 workers have moved from their original tents into new homes and cellars. More than 10,000 square meters of houses and cellars under construction can also be completed by the end of November. By the beginning of December, the bureau's employees will be able to move into heated houses and cellars for the winter.

More than 10,000 square meters of houses and several thousand square meters of cellars, funded by the state to support thousands of workers in Karamay's infrastructure, transportation and other units, will also be completed by the end of this month. After these houses are completed, workers from units supporting Karamay participating in winter construction will all be able to obtain housing.

Other welfare facilities built for employees have also been mostly completed. At present, thirteen canteens have been built in residential areas and various field exploration areas. Vegetables for the winter consumption of workers are being transported from various places to the mining area, and more than 2,000 cattle and sheep that have been purchased are grazing on winter pastures near Karamay. The mining area trade department has also ordered more than 60 tons of frozen fish from Altay for the workers.

Xinhua News Agency, Da Qaidam, 21st: The newly developed Da Qaidam Yeyang Coal Mine has recently added more than 100 coal miners. This coal mine will produce a large amount of coal for the petroleum exploration personnel who will be spending the winter in the Qaidam Basin.

The Yeyang Coal Mine is only more than 20 kilometers away from Da Qaidam and is a good anthracite mine. The mine is open-pit mining, which does not require long-distance transportation of pit props and large equipment, nor does it require high technology, so the investment is small, the cost is low, and mining is convenient. Employees of the Northwest Geological Bureau 632 Team, the Geological Department of the Qinghai Petroleum Exploration Bureau, and Mangya, Lenghu, Tanggula and other regions are now using coal mined from this coal mine.

This year, the Qaidam winter coal was originally planned to be supplied by the Yuka Coal Mine. However, the mechanical equipment and pit prop transportation of this mine are difficult, and the well has recently experienced water inflow, which has brought great difficulties to production. Therefore, the Chinese Communist Party Qaidam Working Committee decided to develop the Yeyang Coal Mine nearby. With the cooperation of relevant departments, the Yeyang Coal Mine rushed to repair a road to the mining area in mid-October, strengthened the strength of the handicraft cooperative responsible for mining, and transferred some workers from the Yuka Coal Mine.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 21st: Near the various coalfield exploration work areas in Henan, Jiangxi, Hunan, and Guangxi, relevant units are building eight semi-permanent residential areas for exploration workers. Some of the residences in Yuxian, Xin'an, Jiaozuo in Henan, and Qifengdu in Hunan, where construction started earlier, have now been completed, and the exploration workers have moved into their new homes with their families. In the areas where construction started the latest, exploration workers will also likely be able to move into their new homes during the Spring Festival this year.

This batch of residences, funded by the State Planning Commission and the Ministry of Coal Industry, totals about 34,000 square meters. After all these residences are completed, they can basically solve the housing problem for nearly 5,000 coalfield geological exploration workers and their families in the Central and Southern regions. Some residential areas have also built new primary schools and public bathhouses. These residential areas are close to the construction sites, and even the farthest ones can be reached by car or train within a few hours.

Coalfield geological exploration workers working in these areas used to live in farmers' homes or tents. Because they often move around, it is difficult for families to reunite, and it is also difficult for their children to attend school. After these residences are built near the exploration sites, the exploration workers can settle down relatively permanently.

    给野外勘探工作人员作好过冬准备
    ★据新华社克拉玛依21日电　建设克拉玛依油区的一万多名职工的过冬设备问题，已经得到妥善解决。到目前为止，克拉玛依矿务局已经建成了四万三千多平方公尺的住宅和一万多平方公尺的地窖；五千多名职工已经从原来的帐篷迁进了新的住宅和地窖。正在建筑中的一万多平方公尺的房屋和地窖，在11月底也可以完工。到12月初，矿务局的职工就可以全部搬进有保暖设备的房舍和地窖里过冬。
    由国家拨款为支援克拉玛依基建、运输等单位数千名职工而修建的一万多平方公尺房屋和数千平方公尺的地窖，也将在本月底全部竣工。这些房舍建成以后，参加冬季施工的支援克拉玛依的单位职工都可以得到房舍居住。
    为职工兴建的其他各项福利设施，也都大部分建成。目前，住宅区和各个野外探区已经建成了十三个食堂。职工们冬季食用的蔬菜正从各地向矿区运送，已购买的两千多头牛、羊，正在克拉玛依附近冬季牧场上放牧。矿区贸易部门还为职工们从阿勒泰订购了六十多吨冻鱼。
    ★新华社大柴旦21日电　新开发的大柴旦野羊煤矿最近增加了一百多名采煤工人。这个煤矿将为在柴达木盆地过冬的石油勘探人员生产大量的燃煤。
    野羊煤矿离大柴旦只有二十多公里，是一个较好的无烟煤矿。这个矿是露天开采，不需要远途运来坑木和较大的设备，也不需较高的技术，因此投资少、成本低、开采便利。西北地质局六三二队、青海石油勘探局地质处和茫崖、冷湖、唐古拉等地区的职工，现在都已经用到这个煤矿开采出来的煤了。
    今年，柴达木过冬用煤原计划是由鱼卡煤矿供应的。但是这个矿的机械设备和坑木运输困难，最近井下又出了水，给生产带来了很大困难，因此中共柴达木工作委员会决定就近开发野羊煤矿。在有关部门的配合下，野羊煤矿在10月中旬就抢修了一条通往矿区的公路，加强了负责开采的手工业联社的力量，并且从鱼卡煤矿调来了一部分工人。
    ★新华社武汉21日电　在河南、江西、湖南和广西各个煤田勘探工区附近，有关单位正在为勘探工人建设八处半永久性的住宅区。开工较早的河南禹县、新安、焦作和湖南栖凤渡等处的住宅，现在有一部分已经建成，勘探工人已经带着他们的家眷搬进了新居。开工最晚的地区，勘探工人们也将有可能在今年春节搬进新居。
    这批由国家计划委员会和煤炭工业部拨款兴建的住宅，一共约有三万四千平方公尺。这些住宅全部建成以后，基本上可以解决中南地区近五千名煤田地质勘探职工及其家属的居住问题。有的住宅区还新盖了小学校和公共浴室。这些住宅区都接近工地，就是离工地最远的，乘汽车或火车在几小时以内也可以到达。
    在这些地区工作的煤田地质勘探职工，过去一直住在农民家里或帐篷里。因为时常流动，家人难以团聚，子弟入学也很困难。在勘探工地附近兴建这些住宅以后，勘探工人们就可以相对地固定下来。
