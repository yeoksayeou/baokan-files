Xinhua News Agency, November 26th, Damascus Dispatch: Syrian newspapers on November 25th published photographs of weapons recently intercepted by the Syrian military that were being transported from Iraq to Syria. This batch of weapons was intended for conspirators to use to subvert the Syrian government. The photos show that among the weapons secretly transported from Iraq to Syria were British-made 12.7mm anti-tank guns, machine guns, and rifles.

The Syrian military issued a statement saying that military authorities have begun investigating the conspirators in order to bring them to trial.

The Syrian cabinet held a secret meeting to discuss how to deal with this conspiracy to subvert the government.

Syrian Minister of Education Abdul Wahab Homad told reporters on November 24th that this conspiracy to overthrow the Syrian government was an imperialist plot. "The execution of this conspiracy was entrusted to the head of an Arab government, in order to eliminate the Arab nation in Syria and impose decisions on Syria that are in line with the interests of Israel and imperialism." Homad also said: "This conspiracy is broader than a general plan aimed at overthrowing a regime."

According to Xinhua News Agency, a Syrian Army spokesman on the evening of November 23rd accused Iraq of providing weapons to certain Syrians who apparently intended to stage a revolt against the government.

The spokesman accused Iraqi Prime Minister and Minister of Defense Said of participating in the conspiracy.

An Iraqi government spokesman issued a statement on November 24th denying that Iraq had transported weapons and ammunition to Syria to create disturbances.
