　　Propagating Water Hyacinth from Seeds

　　(Our report) Guangdong Province's agricultural technology departments have successfully researched a method for propagating high-quality pig feed, water hyacinth, from seeds over the past year. The germination rate is mostly above 90%, and the seedlings generally grow well. Recently, many farmers in the Pearl River Delta, Han River Plain, and other places have begun selecting and saving seeds.

　　Water hyacinth seeds are about the size of sesame seeds and are attached to the root clusters. They easily break and fall off when mature. Therefore, in the past, many people thought that water hyacinth had no seeds and used asexual reproduction instead. In places where there was no water hyacinth, it had to be transported for planting, which was very expensive, and it easily rotted and died. Often, only 20% remained upon arrival. Using seed propagation overcomes these difficulties. In the future, this sweet and delicious green fodder will be propagated on a much larger scale.

    用种子繁殖水浮莲
    本报讯　良好的猪饲料水浮莲种子繁殖的方法经过广东省农业技术部门一年来的试验研究，已经成功。发芽率多在90％以上，幼苗普遍生长良好。最近，珠江三角洲、韩江平原等地已经有许多农民进行选种留种。
    水浮莲的种子像芝麻大小，附着在根簇旁边，老熟的时候很容易破裂跌落，所以过去很多人以为水浮莲没有种子，都是采用无性繁殖，没有水浮莲的地方要运水浮莲去栽植，运费很贵，而且容易腐烂枯死，往往运到目的地只剩下20％了。采用种子繁殖以后，就克服了这些困难。今后，这种甘香味美的青饲料将会更大量地繁殖起来。
