    Aunt Huang of Wuxi
    Peng Hui
    Our visiting group arrived in Wuxi at a little after ten o'clock on the morning of September 14th. Several responsible comrades from the Wuxi City Federation of Trade Unions came to the train station to welcome us. Immediately, we boarded the large bus prepared by the City Federation of Trade Unions and headed into the city. While driving, I noticed an old lady on our bus, wearing a blue cloth uniform top and a black silk skirt, about sixty years old, with earrings and a gold ring with a jade inlay on her finger, talking to a comrade from our group. I thought this old lady was probably the mother or some relative of one of our comrades who came to welcome us, and she was just hitching a ride on the bus.

    When the bus arrived at the City Federation of Trade Unions and everyone got off, I noticed that the old lady had bound feet from the reform era, walked with a slight sway, but her waist was straight, and she was relatively tall. Her whole figure seemed very sturdy and robust, and she spoke with great energy.

    She hurried to get off the bus first and, as a host, invited us into the Federation of Trade Unions' reception room. At this point, I realized that I was wrong to assume she was a family member of a comrade. "She's a cadre in charge of receiving guests..." I thought.

    After everyone sat down, the hosts and our twenty-odd guests introduced themselves to each other. When the comrade pointed to the old lady and introduced her as "Comrade Huang Huilan, Vice Chairman of the Wuxi City Federation of Trade Unions," everyone's faces showed surprise, and some even uttered a soft "Ah..." of admiration.

    When I encounter people who underestimate an unfamiliar woman, I criticize them for looking down on women, but at this moment, I felt that I was also to be blamed. "It turns out that I, too, have an underlying contempt for women in my consciousness..." I was angry at myself...

    We began to feel respect for this old lady, Comrade Huang Huilan, Vice Chairman of the Wuxi City Federation of Trade Unions.

    After a comrade gave us an introduction to the situation of the Wuxi Silk Factory, he asked Comrade Huang Huilan if she had anything to add. He also explained to us that Aunt Huang only left production after liberation and has more than 40 years of work experience. She is now sixty-three years old.

    Aunt Huang stood up and briefly added two points: first, she explained that about ninety percent of the workers in the silk factory are female; second, she explained that in the main workshop of the silk factory—the silk reeling workshop—child laborers accounted for 60% until the early days of liberation. Now, all are adult female workers. She said this is a prominent difference before and after liberation, and she added that she herself started working in the silk reeling workshop at the age of nine.

    This point not only helped us further understand Aunt Huang's background but also made me realize her strong class consciousness. She could not forget her own personal suffering and her own interests, and therefore, when others forgot to talk about the numbers of eliminated child labor, she immediately and decisively supplemented the explanation of this important change before and after liberation.

    "Ah, this is truly a representative of her own class!" I was deeply moved.

    That afternoon, Aunt Huang went with us to tour Taihu Lake. She told me: because she is busy with work, even though Wuxi is right by Taihu Lake, she has not visited Taihu Lake for a very long time.

    "Now, taking advantage of the opportunity to entertain you, I'm also stealing some time to have fun," she said with a smile.

    It was raining during the tour. I have asthma and am most afraid of rain, so I always fell behind everyone. She constantly took care of me.

    Although she had many wrinkles on her face, her hair was still black. As for me, although I was more than ten years younger than her, I already had so much white hair. Perhaps she saw this great difference in appearance between us, so without even asking my name, she called me "White-Haired Old Lady..."

    When she couldn't see me for a while, she would shout:

    "The White-Haired Old Lady is falling behind... Help her along!"

    I couldn't help but feel both annoyed and amused. How could I be seen as so useless by this sixty-year-old lady..., but I was sincerely grateful for her enthusiasm. Her healthy demeanor of holding a large umbrella and taking brisk steps in the rain with her bound feet was truly something I was ashamed to be inferior to...

    In the evening, she stayed with us at the Taihu Hotel and shared a room with me. I was happy to have such an opportunity to get close to her.

    We chatted again under the lamp.

    She told me that when she started working in the silk factory at the age of nine, her family had a mother and a disabled father. Her wages and her mother's income from needlework were the family's source of livelihood.

    She married at twenty-three, and her husband died four years later. Her income as a silk reeler was not enough to support her and her three-year-old son. To earn extra money, she also did needlework at night. Generally, silk reelers' fingertips were always pale and swollen because they often handled cocoons in boiling water at a temperature of eighty-five degrees. She held up her hand and said to me:

    "During the day, ten fingers are soaked in boiling water, and at night, these hands have to take up needle and thread... If my son got sick..."

    Her voice was low. She shook her head, her eyes fixed on one of her hands. I could see how many memories of hard times appeared in her mind at this moment...

    After the May Thirtieth Massacre, Aunt Huang received the baptism of revolution. Soon, this young widow—a silk reeler—became a Communist Party member.

    When she talked about how many sister groups were organized in their factory at this time, how she did the work of the red trade union group, and how the trade union led them to struggle against the capitalists, her voice rose again, and she smiled, squinting her eyes.

    Later, the Party organization in Wuxi was completely destroyed. For a long time, the workers groaned in the dark life as if they had lost the sun. Aunt Huang said that at this time, she thought that her life would be tormented forever. "Let the next generation fight for a better life." That's what she thought.

    But a few years before liberation, she found the organization again and resumed her organizational life. She was once selected as a representative of Wuxi female workers to attend a meeting in the liberated area, but she was unable to go.

    After liberation, she left production and devoted herself to trade union work. It was also at this time that she began to learn literacy. As a trade union representative, she visited Beijing the year before last. Her son is an ironworker, and she now has six grandchildren. Every weekend is a day for her to gather with her son, daughter-in-law, and grandchildren.

    "Finally, we have truly turned ourselves over..." she said with a smile.

    When I was packing to go to bed, she told me: "Tomorrow I have to give a report to some cadres of the trade union on the work of female workers. But in the meantime, there is still a question that I haven't figured out myself. I still have to look at two documents... You go to sleep first."

    Lying in bed, looking through the mosquito net at the old lady wearing old-fashioned glasses and sitting at the desk reading documents, I couldn't fall asleep for a long time.

    无锡黄大姐
    彭慧
    我们参观团在9月14号上午十点多钟到达无锡。无锡市工会来了几位负责同志到火车站欢迎我们。马上，我们坐上了市工会备来的大汽车进城去。行车时，我发现我们车上有一位上穿蓝布制服，下着黑虎绸裙子的老太太，年约六十左右，耳上戴有耳环，手指上有一只镶玉的金戒子，正和我们团的一位同志谈话。我想这位老太太大概总是来欢迎我们的某位同志的母亲，或者什么亲属，顺便搭这辆车子的罢。
    车子开到市总工会大家下车的时候，我发现这位老太太的脚是一双改组派的小脚，走路稍稍有点扭，腰身却直直的，个子比较高，整个身材显得很结实，硬朗，说起话来精神抖擞。
    她赶着先下车来，以主人的身分，邀请我们进了工会的客厅。这时我觉得我把她估计为某位同志的家属，是错了，“是招待客人的干部啊……”我想。
    大家坐下来以后，几位主人和我们二十几个客人，彼此作了介绍。当那位同志指着这位老太太介绍说：“这是无锡市工会副主席黄蕙兰同志”的时候，大家的脸上都显出了惊奇的表情，有的都“啊……”的一声发出了轻微的赞叹。
    当我遇到一些人把一个不认识的女人估价得很低的时候就责备人看不起女人，而这时我感到我自己也是该责备的了。“原来我也和人家一样，意识里潜在着对女人的轻视……”我对我自己生着气……
    我们开始对这位老太太，这位无锡市工会副主席黄蕙兰同志起了敬意。
    一位同志向我们作了关于无锡市丝厂情况介绍后，请问黄蕙兰同志有什么需要补充的。他并向我们说明黄大姐直到解放后才脱离生产，有40多年的工龄，现在已经六十三岁了。
    黄大姐站起来简单地补充了两点：第一点，说明丝厂工人百分之九十左右是女工；第二点是说明丝厂的主要车间——缫丝车间的工人，直到解放初期，童工还占有60％，现在，则全部是成年女工了。她说这是解放前后一个突出的区别，她又说她自己就是九岁开始进缫丝车间的。
    这一点说明不但使我们进一步了解了黄大姐的身世，而且使我认识到她的坚强的阶级意识。她不能忘记她自己的切身的痛苦和切身的利益因而就在别人忘记谈消灭了童工的数字时候，就马上斩钉截铁地补充说明了解放前后这一个重要的变化。
    “啊，这才真正是自己阶级的代表人物呢！”我深深被激动了。
    就在这天下午，黄大姐和我们一同游了太湖。她告诉我：因为工作忙，虽然无锡就在太湖边，却有很久很久没逛太湖了。
    “现在，趁招待你们的机会，我也偷工夫来玩玩罢。”她笑着说。
    游览的时候下着雨，我因为有喘病，最怕下雨，所以总是赶不上大家。她就不断地照顾我。
    她虽然脸上有很多皱纹了，头发却还是黑乌乌的。而我呢，我虽然比她小了十几岁，却已经有了这么多的白头发；大约她看出了这是我和她两人在形貌上的很大的区别，于是也不问我的姓名就叫我“白头发老太太……”
    一会儿不见我了时，就嚷着：
    “白头发老太太掉队啦……搀扶一下罢！”
    我听了禁不住又好气又好笑，怎么我就被这位六十多岁的老太太看成这样不中用了呢……，可是她的热情我是衷心感激的。她那种打着一把大雨伞用她的改组派的小脚在雨下迈着迅速步子的健康的神情，也实在令我感到惭愧不如……
    晚上，她和我们一同住在太湖饭店，并且和我住在同一个房间。我高兴得到这样一个和她亲近的机会。
    我们在灯下又聊了起来。
    她告诉我：她在九岁开始进丝厂作工的时候，家里有母亲和残废了的父亲，她的工资和母亲做针线活的收入就是家庭的生活来源。
    二十三岁结婚，四年后，丈夫就死了。她做缫丝工的工钱收入不够维持她和她的三岁儿子的生活，为找外快，晚上又作针线活。一般缫丝女工，因为经常在八十五度高温的滚水里提茧，手指尖总是泡得白抛抛的。她举起手对我说：
    “白天，十个指头泡在开水里，晚上这双手还要拿针线……儿子要是生了病啊……”
    她的声音是低沉的。她摇着头，眼睛凝视她的一只手。我看得出这时在她的脑子里出现了多少艰苦岁月的回忆……
    五卅惨案以后，黄大姐受了革命的洗礼，不久这位年青的寡妇——缫丝女工成了共产党员。
    她谈到她们厂里这时组织好多姊妹团，她怎么做红色工会小组工作，工会怎么领导她们向资本家斗争的时候，她的声音又高扬起来，眯着眼睛微笑了。
    后来，无锡的党的组织遭到完全破坏，很久一个时期，工人们像失去了太阳一样在阴暗的生活下呻吟。黄大姐说她这时以为这一生就是受一辈子折磨完了。“好日子等儿子辈来争取罢。”她这么想。
    但是在解放前几年，她又找到了组织，恢复了组织生活，她曾经被选为无锡女工的代表去解放区开会，但是没能通过去。
    解放后，她脱离了生产，专做工会工作。也就在此时开始学文化。作为工会代表，她前年到过北京。她的儿子是个铁工，她现在有六个孙子了。每逢周末就是她和儿子、媳妇、孙儿们欢聚的日子。
    “到底还是翻身了……”她微笑着说。
    我收拾上床睡觉的时候，她告诉我：“明天我要给工会的一些干部作一个关于女工工作的传达报告。可是这中间我自己还有个没搞清的问题，还得看两个文件……你先睡罢。”
    我躺在床上，隔着蚊帐，看着这位戴上老光眼镜、坐在写字台前看文件的老太太，我久久地不能入睡。
