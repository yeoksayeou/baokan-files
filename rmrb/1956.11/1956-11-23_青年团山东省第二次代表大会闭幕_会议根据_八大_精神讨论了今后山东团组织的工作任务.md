Xinhua News Agency report: The Second Congress of the Communist Youth League of Shandong Province was held in Jinan City from November 7th to 15th. A total of seven hundred delegates attended the congress, representing 1,640,000 League members across the province.

The congress reviewed and approved the work report of the previous Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League. The congress believed that in the four years since the First Congress, the Communist Youth League organizations in Shandong Province have achieved great success in organizing and mobilizing the vast number of young people to carry out socialist transformation and socialist construction. The number of League members in the province has increased from 680,000 in 1952 to 1,640,000. More than 90,000 League branches are distributed in factories, rural areas, schools, government offices, and other sectors throughout the province. All of the more than 70,000 agricultural production cooperatives in the province have League members, and the vast majority have established League organizations. In the past four years, more than 140,000 outstanding League members in the province have honorably joined the Communist Party of China.

The congress also seriously criticized the shortcomings of subjectivism, bureaucracy, and lack of thoroughness in the work of the previous Provincial League Committee and some League leadership organizations. Based on the spirit of the Eighth National Congress of the Party and the specific circumstances of the province, the congress discussed the tasks of the Shandong League organization in the future. The congress emphasized that, in order to fully mobilize the enthusiasm of the province's youth and more effectively organize them to participate in socialist construction, League organizations at all levels should establish and strengthen the League's political and ideological work, adopt various methods to educate the vast number of young people, and enable them to correctly understand and handle the relationship between individual interests and collective interests. At the same time, it is necessary to organize young people to study cultural, scientific, and technical knowledge and to care about their lives.

The congress elected the Second Committee of the Communist Youth League of Shandong Province and also elected one hundred delegates to attend the Third National Congress of the League. In addition, the congress also awarded prizes to fifty-eight outstanding League members and nine outstanding grassroots organizations of the Communist Youth League.
