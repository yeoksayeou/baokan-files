    The Old Caretaker in the Library
    Zeng Zhao'an
    In the stacks of the Beijing Library, staff members hurry back and forth, searching for books requested by readers. Among the busy people, there is an old man with white hair, also working diligently.
    "Uncle Han, where is this book?" When a young librarian, unable to find a book, would shyly come to him and ask, he would always say with a kind smile, like an elder: "Over there, on the last bookshelf on the east side." Or he would personally lead them to get it.
    This white-haired old man is the old caretaker of the Beijing Library's stacks – Han Songshou, head of the Storage Group.
    He is sixty-four years old this year. He studied diligently from a young age and graduated from Zhili Law and Politics School. In the old society, based on what he had learned, he could have climbed the ladder of the feudal comprador ruling class. However, because he had no backing and did not like to curry favor, and because he loved books, he worked as a book management worker in the preparatory office of the then Capital Library (which later merged with Beihai Library to become the National Beijing Library) after a very short period as an elementary school teacher. Since then, he has never left it, like an old caretaker. September 15th this year was exactly the 40th anniversary of his arrival at the library. That day, the leaders even held a special commemorative meeting for him. "I will never forget it in my life, there was no such thing in the old society!" He said to me with a reminiscent air when talking about this meeting.
    The hair on his forehead has long since fallen out, and what remains is as white as cotton. However, from his spirit to his heart, he has not aged at all.
    Every morning, the librarians are busy in the stacks, reading rooms, and at the circulation desks, waiting for the start of work and welcoming the arrival of readers. Once the borrowing time arrives, they are busy and tense. And in the evening, when the last reader leaves the library, they are busy checking and organizing the books. Like many librarians, Old Man Han Songshou works like this all year round, and he loves his job.
    However, he, who volunteered to dedicate himself to this work, did not receive social recognition or have any security in the old society. Every strand of his hair, every wrinkle, seems to tell people how he struggled in the old society. In the era of Duan Qirui and Zhang Zuolin, salaries were already low, but they were still in arrears or reduced every year, leaving him with no rice to cook, often filling his stomach with bean cakes. Colleagues ran away one after another to make a living. He really wanted to find another way, but he couldn't bear to abandon these spiritual food of the people of the motherland, so he finally stayed and did not leave his companion – the book stacks. Later, when the warlord separatist regime ended, he thought things would be better under the rule of the Kuomintang, but instead of good things, bad things came. Prices soared every day, and life became even harder to make a living. Speaking of the period of Japanese puppet rule, life was already hard enough, but his heart was even more bitter. The books he cherished all his life, the essence of the motherland's culture, were taken away from the stacks batch by batch by the Japanese imperialists. What a painful thing! This was a great shame for the motherland, and also a great shame for him. How could he forget it? His anger has not completely subsided even now.
    After liberation, his work became glorious, he was respected everywhere, his salary was constantly increased, his life was improved year by year, and his children were all cultivated into adults by the Party. Ah! How could he not work a hundred times harder? Currently, although his legs are a bit unresponsive and his head often feels dizzy, he still works tirelessly, managing it like an old grandfather managing his own home.
    "Now, not only is life liberated, but even the mind is liberated." When talking about the current situation of life, he suddenly smiled at the corner of his mouth and said slowly: "In the past, although I did book management work for decades, it was just a personal hobby. I never thought about why I was doing this work! Now, I understand, the Party and Chairman Mao taught me: to work for the people, to preserve the labor achievements and cultural traditions of the people for thousands of years, so that readers now and for thousands of generations can see it, use it, and learn from it at any time. This is extremely valuable." Finally, he also said: "Readers complain that retrieving books is too slow and wastes too much time, and improvements are being studied."
    In the reading room, young people are quietly reading books, some smiling because they have made new discoveries in their studies, and some are taking notes seriously. In front of the circulation desk, those who have borrowed books leave the counter in groups of two or three, happily… Our white-haired old caretaker smiles with satisfaction as he watches them.

    图书馆里的老管家
    曾昭安
    在北京图书馆书库里，工作人员们穿梭似地东奔西跑，找寻读者所要借阅的书。在忙碌的人们当中，有一位白发苍苍的老人，也在辛勤地工作着。
    “韩伯伯，这本书在哪里？”当年青的图书管理员因为寻不着书，不好意思地跑到他面前问他时，他总像长辈一样和蔼可亲地含着笑说：“在那边，东头最后一个书架上。”或者亲自领着他去拿。
    这位白发老人就是北京图书馆书库里的老管家——庋藏组组长韩嵩寿。
    他今年六十四岁了。自幼勤学苦读，直隶法政学堂毕业。在旧社会里，按他所学，本可以爬上封建买办统治阶级阶梯的。但是，因为他一来没有靠山，不喜欢逢迎，二来他酷爱书籍，所以，仅做了极短时期的小学教员之后，就到当时的京师图书馆筹备处（后和北海图书馆合并，成为国立北京图书馆）作管理图书的工作。自此以后，就像老管家一样从没有离开过它。今年9月15日刚好是他到馆四十周年的日子。那天，领导同志还专门为他开了个纪念会。“我一生也不能忘记啊，旧社会那有这回事呀！”谈起这个会的时候，他回味似地对我说。
    他前额头发早已脱光，剩下的也白得像棉絮一样了。可是，从他的精神到他的心灵，却一点没有衰老。
    每天早上，图书管理员们就在书库里、阅览室中和借书台上忙这忙那，等待上班时刻的到来，迎接读者们的到来。借书时刻一到，他们就紧张地忙碌起来了。而晚上，当最后一个读者离开了图书馆的时候，他们又忙着检查、整理书籍了。韩嵩寿老人也像许多图书管理员一样，终年这样工作着，他热爱自己的工作。
    可是，志愿献身于这个工作的他，在旧社会里，却得不到社会的重视，生活毫无保障。他每一根头发，每一条皱纹，好像在告诉人们，他怎样在旧社会里挣扎过来。在段祺瑞、张作霖时代，薪金本来就不多，还要年年欠薪、减薪，弄得无米下锅，经常用豆饼充饥。同行们为了生活，都一个接着一个地跑了。他也真想找别的门路，但是，又舍不得丢开这些祖国人民的精神食粮，终于留下来，没有离开他的伴侣——书库。后来，军阀割据结束了，在国民党统治下，以为这回可好了，谁知好处没来坏处来，物价天天飞涨，生活更难糊口。说到日伪时期，生活本来就够苦了，但是，他的心灵更苦。他终身所珍爱的书籍，祖国文化的精华，被日本帝国主义者从库里一批批地抢走了。多痛心的事情啊！这是祖国的奇耻大辱，也是他的奇耻大辱，他怎能忘记呢？至今他的愤怒还没有全消呢。
    解放后，他的工作变成了光荣的工作，处处受到人的尊敬，工资不断提高，生活逐年改善，儿女们一个个都被党培养成人。啊！叫他怎能不百倍地努力工作呢？目前，他腿虽有些不听使唤了，头又经常发晕，但他仍然不倦地工作着，像老爷爷管理着自己家园那样。
    “现在，不仅生活解放，连思想也解放了。”当谈到目前生活情形时，突然，他嘴角一笑，慢吞吞地说：“过去，我虽做了几十年图书管理工作，但只是个人嗜好罢了，从没想过为什么干这个工作！现在，我明白了，党和毛主席教会了我：为人民工作，把人民几千年来的劳动成果、文化传统好好地保存起来，让现在和千年万代的读者随时都可以看到它，利用它，学习它，这是极有价值的事。”最后，他还说：“读者嫌取书太迟，浪费时间太多，现在正研究改进呢。”
    在阅览室里，青年们静静地看着书，有的因为在学习中有了新的发现而微笑着，有的正在认真地做笔记。在借书台前，借到了书的，三三两两，欢天喜地离开柜台……我们的白发老管家望着他们发出了满意的微笑。　陈志插图（附图片）
