    Children's Happiness
    ——A Record of the Health Care Class at Nanchang Street Primary School in Shenyang——
    By Our Correspondent Yuan Liang
    In March 1955, Nanchang Street Primary School in Shenyang, with the direct assistance of the Hygiene Teaching and Research Group of the China Medical University of Shenyang, established two health care classes, concentrating eighty-eight children with weak constitutions and poor development. When the health care classes were established, the health status of these children was much worse than that of children of the same age in Shenyang. During class, two-thirds of the children had difficulty concentrating due to their physical condition, and some even fell asleep at their desks during singing. The incidence of illness among the students was also high. Nearly half of the students in the second-grade health care class frequently missed classes due to illness before joining the health care class. Now, the situation is completely different. The children's weight and height have increased extraordinarily. They are full of energy in class and very lively after class. From March 1955 to the end of the year, the weight of second-grade students in the health care class increased by an average of two kilograms, and their height increased by an average of 5.4 centimeters. In the last semester, the development indicators of all children in the health care classes have exceeded the health standards of children of the same age in Shenyang. As the children's health levels improved, their academic performance also improved. Looking at the test scores in Chinese language, more than 86% of the students scored four or five, and failing grades have been eliminated. In the past, only 66% of the children in the health care classes scored four or above on tests. Most of the others failed.
    Before the establishment of these two health care classes, the Hygiene Teaching and Research Group of the China Medical University of Shenyang helped the school conduct a physical examination of all students, followed by developmental measurements of the children. After the initial determination of the targets for the health care classes, clinical diagnoses, X-ray fluoroscopy, and comprehensive analysis and research on the development of each student were carried out. Thus, the two health care classes were declared established. Because this was a new endeavor, there were various doubts among teachers, parents, and students. Parents said, "My child is not sick, just a little weak. I'm afraid that being grouped with sick children will lead to the spread of disease, and they won't be able to keep up with the regular classes." The children were also unwilling to attend the health care classes, and some teachers were unwilling to be class teachers in the health care classes. Later, the school conducted much persuasion work with the teachers and children, dispelling their doubts about the health care classes. At the same time, the school explained the nature and purpose of the health care classes to the parents in detail through parents' meetings, announced the work plan of the health care classes, and invited the parents to visit the student physical examination record cards, making them realize that the health care classes were not "contagious disease hospitals." Therefore, the parents' consent was obtained.
    After the establishment of the health care classes, the school first improved the teaching methods according to the characteristics of children's physical and mental development. More visual teaching materials such as wall charts, models, and specimens were used in lectures, and great attention was also paid to teaching hygiene in the classroom. After lecturing for about twenty minutes, the teacher would close the book and guide the children to guess riddles, sing songs, do gymnastics, or rest at their desks for three or four minutes before continuing the lesson. For courses that required children to fully use their thinking, such as Chinese and arithmetic, activities such as singing and guessing riddles, which might cause children to become overly excited and increase their intellectual consumption, were avoided. During the teaching process, teachers also constantly corrected the sitting and standing postures of the children, especially those with abnormal bone development. In addition, the seating arrangement was generally changed once a month in the classroom to prevent the occurrence of amblyopia, and children with vision and hearing problems were appropriately placed in the front. In the summer and autumn seasons, there was also an outdoor lesson every day. Later, these teaching hygiene measures played a direct role in protecting children's health.
    Strengthening hygiene education and physical exercise was also an important part of improving teaching in the health care classes. Through the school's education, good hygiene habits and hygiene morality were cultivated among the students in the health care classes.
    At the same time, the school adopted various methods to ensure that children could continuously engage in physical exercise both inside and outside the classroom, on and off campus. On campus, in addition to physical education classes, time was set aside every day to organize children to engage in physical exercise. At the beginning of physical exercise, teachers paid attention to appropriate moderation to prevent children from becoming overly tired due to strenuous exercise. Now, the school has also formulated corresponding exercise methods based on the different developmental characteristics of each child, and teachers guide the children to carry out physical exercise separately. As a result of long-term physical exercise, the children in the health care classes have not only improved their physical fitness but also their athletic skills. Last semester, the children in the health care classes appeared at the school's sports meet as winners. In the competition between the second-grade students of the health care class and the regular class, they won five championships in kicking small leather balls, calculation relay races, kicking shuttlecocks, and throwing pockets.
    Children spend more than half of their time at home. Although they receive all kinds of care on campus, the health care effect will be greatly weakened if family cooperation is lost. Generally, children at home go to bed late at night and cannot get up in the morning, resulting in insufficient sleep, and their diets are neither quantitative nor timed. This is very detrimental to the normal development of children. Therefore, the school paid special attention to carrying out parent work, holding six parents' meetings for health care class students in one semester, requiring parents to help children establish a normal life system at home and exchange experiences in caring for children. Teachers also visited students' families extensively and deeply, mobilizing parents to care about students' health together. Sun Jimin, the class teacher of the second-grade health care class, visited Song Bairong's family eight times in a row in one semester, promoting cooperation between parents and the school, thus changing the health status of this child.
    In addition, the school also established a snack kitchen for the health care classes. Each student prepared a rice bowl and brought a meal of staple and non-staple foods from home, which the snack kitchen was responsible for steaming. The school provided a large pot of nutritious soup (spinach and tofu soup, egg and shredded pork soup, etc.). At the same time, menus were formulated weekly according to the nutritional needs of the children, with no repetition every day. In this way, each student only spent an average of 1.6 cents per day on food and could eat a comfortable snack, averaging 718 calories, accounting for 28% of the daily calorie requirement for each child.
    Now, Nanchang Street Primary School, with the active help of the Hygiene Teaching and Research Group of the China Medical University, has newly established two (a total of five including the previous ones) health care classes, and the number of health care class students has increased to 198. In addition, the China Medical University also sent a special person to organize students with scoliosis in the school to carry out national-style sports therapy, and two or three doctors came to the school in person to guide them every day. Medical workers in Shenyang and other cities in Liaoning have also launched volunteer physical examinations for primary school children. In order to promote this health care education that costs little and yields great results, fifty schools in Shenyang have now established one hundred and eight health care classes.

    孩子们的幸福
    ——记沈阳南昌街小学保健班——
    本报记者　袁良
    沈阳市南昌街小学，在1955年3月间，集中了八十八名体质虚弱，发育不良的儿童，在沈阳中国医科大学卫生教研组的直接帮助下，建立了两个保健班。保健班成立的时候，这些儿童的健康状况比沈阳市同龄儿童要差得多。上课的时候，有三分之二的孩子因为身体的关系精神不集中，有的甚至在上唱歌的时候也伏在桌上打瞌睡。学生的发病率也很高，二年级保健班有近一半的学生在未进保健班以前经常因病缺课。现在，情况完全不同了。孩子们的体重、身长都有着异乎寻常的增长。在课堂上精神饱满，下课后都很活泼。从1955年3月到年底，保健班二年级学生的体重，平均增长了二公斤，身长平均增高了五点四公分。上学期全体保健班儿童的发育指标，已经突破了沈阳市同龄儿童的健康标准。随着儿童健康水平的提高，学习成绩也提高了。以语文课考试成绩来看，获得四分、五分的学生，已经达到总人数的86％以上，不及格的现象已经消灭。而保健班的儿童在过去，只有66％的学生考试成绩在四分以上。其他大都不及格。
    在这两个保健班成立以前，沈阳中国医科大学卫生教研组帮助学校进行了一次全校学生的体格检查，接着，又进行了儿童发育测定。保健班对象初步确定以后，还进行了临床诊断、爱克斯光透视和对每个学生发育情况的综合分析、研究。于是，两个保健班就宣告成立了。因为这是一件新的工作。在老师、家长和学生中都有各种疑虑。家长们说：“我的孩子并没有病，就是身子弱一些，跟病孩子编到一块恐怕传染上疾病，学习赶不上普通班。”孩子们也不愿意上保健班，有的老师则不愿意到保健班去当班主任。后来，学校对教师和儿童进行了许多的说服工作，解除了他们对保健班的疑虑。同时，学校通过家长联席会向家长详细解释了保健班的性质和目的，并且宣布了保健班的工作计划，又邀请家长们参观学生体格检查纪录卡片，使家长们认识到保健班并不是“传染病院”。因此取得了家长们的同意。
    保健班成立以后，学校根据儿童身心发育的特点，首先改进了教学方法。讲课的时候较多地应用挂图、模型、标本等直观教材，同时在课堂上又十分注意教学卫生。一节课讲授到二十分钟左右，教师就合起书本，指导儿童猜谜语、唱歌、作体操或伏案休息，三、四分钟过后，再继续上课。需要儿童充分运用思维的课程，例如语文、算术等课，就避免采用唱歌、猜谜语等可能引起儿童过度兴奋、加大儿童智力消耗的活动形式。在教学过程中，教师还随时随地矫正儿童、特别是骨胳发育不正常的儿童的坐、立姿势。另外，每月在课堂里还要普遍调动一次座次，防止发生偏视，并且把视、听器官有毛病的儿童，适当安排在前面。夏秋两季，每天还有一节课是露天教学。后来这些教学卫生的措施，对保护儿童的健康起了直接的作用。
    加强卫生教育和体育锻炼也是保健班改进教学工作中的一项重要内容。经过学校的教育，在保健班的学生中培养了良好的卫生习惯和卫生道德。
    同时，学校采用了各种办法，使孩子们不论在课内、课外、校内、校外都能不间断地进行体育锻炼。在校内，除了体育课以外，每天都有一定的时间组织孩子们进行体育锻炼。在体育锻炼开始的时候，教师都注意了适当的节制，防止儿童因剧烈运动而造成过度疲劳。现在学校还根据各个儿童不同的发育特点，制定了相适应的运动方法，由教师指导儿童分别进行体育锻炼。长期进行体育锻炼的结果，保健班的孩子们，不仅体质得到提高，而且运动技巧也提高了。上学期，保健班的孩子们，曾以优胜者的姿态出现在学校的运动会上。保健班二年级学生和普通班的对抗赛中，曾赢得了踢小皮球、演算竞走、踢毽子、投口袋等五项冠军。
    儿童们有一半以上的时间在家庭度过，尽管在校内得到百般照顾，倘若失掉家庭的配合，保健效果就会大大削弱。一般在家里的孩子晚上睡得迟，早晨起不来，睡眠不充足，饮食不定量也不定时。这对儿童的正常发育是非常不利的。所以学校特别注意进行家长工作，在一学期内就召开了六次保健班学生家长联席会，要求家长们帮助儿童建立家庭内的正常生活制度，交流家长们护理儿童的经验。教师们还普遍深入地到学生家庭进行访问，把学生的家长动员起来，共同关心学生的健康。保健班二年级班主任孙继敏，一学期内曾经连续八次访问宋柏荣的家庭，促进家长同学校通力合作，因而改变了这个孩子的健康状况。
    此外，学校还成立了一个保健班的间食灶。每个学生各自预备一个饭盆，从家里带来一餐主副食品，由间食灶负责把它蒸热，学校则供给一大锅富有营养的汤菜（菠菜豆腐汤、鸡蛋肉丝汤等）。同时，还根据儿童营养的需要，按周制定菜谱，每天都不重样。这样一来，每个学生平均一天只拿一分六厘菜钱，就能吃到一顿舒服的间食，平均可以摄取到718卡热量，占每天每个儿童所需热量的28％。
    现在，南昌街小学又在中国医科大学卫生教研组的积极帮助下，新办了两个（连前共办了五个）保健班，保健班学员增加到198名。另外，中国医科大学还派专人把学校里脊柱弯曲的学生组织起来，进行民族形式的体育疗法，每天都有两三个大夫亲自来校指导。沈阳和辽宁其他城市的医务工作者，也都发起过为小学儿童义务检查体格的工作。为了推广这种花钱少、收效大的保健教育，沈阳市现在已有五十所学校建立了一百零八个保健班。
